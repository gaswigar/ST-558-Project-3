first
letter
man
in
the
garb
of
a
slave
went
up
the
side
of
that
mountain
that
is
all
covered
with
forest
the
mountain
pelion
he
carried
in
his
arms
a
little
child
when
it
was
full
noon
the
slave
came
into
a
clearing
of
the
forest
so
silent
that
it
seemed
empty
of
all
life
he
laid
the
child
down
on
the
soft
moss
and
then
trembling
with
the
fear
of
what
might
come
before
him
he
raised
a
horn
to
his
lips
and
blew
three
blasts
upon
it
then
he
waited
the
blue
sky
was
above
him
the
great
trees
stood
away
from
him
and
the
little
child
lay
at
his
feet
he
waited
and
then
he
heard
the
of
great
hooves
and
then
from
between
the
trees
he
saw
coming
toward
him
the
strangest
of
all
beings
one
who
was
half
man
and
half
horse
this
was
chiron
the
centaur
chiron
came
toward
the
trembling
slave
greater
than
any
horse
was
chiron
taller
than
any
man
the
hair
of
his
head
flowed
back
into
his
horse
s
mane
his
great
beard
flowed
over
his
horse
s
chest
in
his
man
s
hand
he
held
a
great
spear
not
swiftly
he
came
but
the
slave
could
see
that
in
those
great
limbs
of
his
there
was
speed
like
to
the
wind
s
the
slave
fell
upon
his
knees
and
with
eyes
that
were
full
of
majesty
and
wisdom
and
limbs
that
were
full
of
strength
and
speed
the
stood
above
him
o
my
lord
the
slave
said
i
have
come
before
thee
sent
by
æson
my
master
who
told
me
where
to
come
and
what
blasts
to
blow
upon
the
horn
and
æson
once
king
of
iolcus
bade
me
say
to
thee
that
if
thou
dost
remember
his
ancient
friendship
with
thee
thou
wilt
perchance
take
this
child
and
guard
and
foster
him
and
as
he
grows
instruct
him
with
thy
for
æson
s
sake
i
will
rear
and
foster
this
child
said
chiron
the
in
a
deep
voice
the
child
lying
on
the
moss
had
been
looking
up
at
the
and
centaur
now
the
slave
lifted
him
up
and
placed
him
in
the
centaur
s
arms
he
said
æson
bade
me
tell
thee
that
the
child
s
name
is
jason
he
bade
me
give
thee
this
ring
with
the
great
ruby
in
it
that
thou
mayst
give
it
to
the
child
when
he
is
grown
by
this
ring
with
its
ruby
and
the
images
engraved
on
it
æson
may
know
his
son
when
they
meet
after
many
years
and
many
changes
and
another
thing
æson
bade
me
say
to
thee
o
my
lord
chiron
not
presumptuous
is
he
but
he
knows
that
this
child
has
the
regard
of
the
immortal
goddess
hera
the
wife
of
chiron
held
æson
s
son
in
his
arms
and
the
little
child
put
hands
into
his
great
beard
then
the
centaur
said
let
æson
know
that
his
son
will
be
reared
and
fostered
by
me
and
that
when
they
meet
again
there
will
be
ways
by
which
they
will
be
known
to
each
illustration
saying
this
chiron
the
centaur
holding
the
child
in
his
arms
went
swiftly
toward
the
forest
arches
then
the
slave
took
up
the
horn
and
went
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
pelion
he
came
to
where
a
horse
was
hidden
and
he
mounted
and
rode
first
to
a
city
and
then
to
a
village
that
was
beyond
the
city
all
this
was
before
the
famous
walls
of
troy
were
built
before
king
priam
had
come
to
the
throne
of
his
father
and
while
he
was
still
known
not
as
priam
but
as
podarces
and
the
beginning
of
all
these
happenings
was
in
iolcus
a
city
in
thessaly
cretheus
founded
the
city
and
had
ruled
over
it
in
days
before
king
priam
was
born
he
left
two
sons
æson
and
pelias
æson
succeeded
his
father
and
because
he
was
a
mild
and
gentle
man
the
men
of
war
did
not
love
æson
they
wanted
a
hard
king
who
would
lead
them
to
conquests
pelias
the
brother
of
æson
was
ever
with
the
men
of
war
he
knew
what
mind
they
had
toward
æson
and
he
plotted
with
them
to
overthrow
his
brother
this
they
did
and
they
brought
pelias
to
reign
as
king
in
iolcus
the
people
loved
æson
and
they
feared
pelias
and
because
the
people
loved
him
and
would
be
maddened
by
his
slaying
pelias
and
the
men
of
war
left
him
living
with
his
wife
alcimide
and
his
infant
son
æson
went
from
the
city
and
in
a
village
that
was
at
a
distance
from
iolcus
he
found
a
hidden
house
and
went
to
dwell
in
it
æson
would
have
lived
content
there
were
it
not
that
he
was
fearful
for
jason
his
infant
son
jason
he
knew
would
grow
into
a
strong
and
a
bold
youth
and
pelias
the
king
would
be
made
uneasy
on
his
account
pelias
would
slay
the
son
and
perhaps
would
slay
the
father
for
the
son
s
sake
when
his
memory
would
come
to
be
less
loved
by
the
people
æson
thought
of
such
things
in
his
hidden
house
and
he
pondered
on
ways
to
have
his
son
reared
away
from
iolcus
and
the
dread
and
the
power
of
king
pelias
he
had
for
a
friend
one
who
was
the
wisest
of
all
the
centaur
chiron
who
was
half
man
and
half
horse
chiron
who
had
lived
and
was
yet
to
live
measureless
years
chiron
had
fostered
heracles
and
it
might
be
that
he
would
not
refuse
to
foster
jason
æson
s
child
away
in
the
fastnesses
of
mount
pelion
chiron
dwelt
once
æson
had
been
with
him
and
had
seen
the
centaur
hunt
with
his
great
bow
and
his
great
spears
and
æson
knew
a
way
that
one
might
come
to
him
chiron
himself
had
told
him
of
the
way
now
there
was
a
slave
in
his
house
who
had
been
a
huntsman
and
who
knew
all
the
ways
of
the
mountain
pelion
æson
talked
with
this
slave
one
day
and
after
he
had
talked
with
him
he
sat
for
a
long
time
over
the
cradle
of
his
sleeping
infant
and
then
he
spoke
to
alcimide
his
wife
telling
her
of
a
parting
that
made
her
weep
that
evening
the
slave
came
in
and
æson
took
the
child
from
the
arms
of
the
mother
and
put
him
in
the
slave
s
arms
also
he
gave
him
a
horn
and
a
ring
with
a
great
ruby
in
it
and
mystic
images
engraved
on
its
gold
then
when
the
ways
were
dark
the
slave
mounted
a
horse
and
with
the
child
in
his
arms
rode
through
the
city
that
king
pelias
ruled
over
in
the
morning
he
came
to
that
mountain
that
is
all
covered
with
forest
the
mountain
pelion
and
that
evening
he
came
back
to
the
village
and
to
æson
s
hidden
house
and
he
told
his
master
how
he
had
prospered
æson
was
content
thereafter
although
he
was
lonely
and
although
his
wife
was
lonely
in
their
childlessness
but
the
time
came
when
they
rejoiced
that
their
child
had
been
sent
into
an
unreachable
place
for
messengers
from
king
pelias
came
inquiring
about
the
boy
they
told
the
king
s
messengers
that
the
child
had
strayed
off
from
his
nurse
and
that
whether
he
had
been
slain
by
a
wild
beast
or
had
been
drowned
in
the
swift
river
anaurus
they
did
not
know
the
years
went
by
and
pelias
felt
secure
upon
the
throne
he
had
taken
from
his
brother
once
he
sent
to
the
oracle
of
the
gods
to
ask
of
it
whether
he
should
be
fearful
of
anything
what
the
oracle
answered
was
this
that
king
pelias
had
but
one
thing
to
coming
of
a
man
the
centaur
nourished
the
child
jason
on
roots
and
fruits
and
honey
for
shelter
they
had
a
great
cave
that
chiron
had
lived
in
for
numberless
years
when
he
had
grown
big
enough
to
leave
the
cave
chiron
would
let
jason
mount
on
his
back
with
the
child
holding
on
to
his
great
mane
he
would
trot
gently
through
the
ways
of
the
forest
jason
began
to
know
the
creatures
of
the
forest
and
their
haunts
sometimes
chiron
would
bring
his
great
bow
with
him
then
jason
on
his
back
would
hold
the
quiver
and
would
hand
him
the
arrows
the
centaur
would
let
the
boy
see
him
kill
with
a
single
arrow
the
bear
the
boar
or
the
deer
and
soon
jason
running
beside
him
hunted
too
no
heroes
were
ever
better
trained
than
those
whose
childhood
and
youth
had
been
spent
with
chiron
the
he
made
them
more
swift
of
foot
than
any
other
of
the
children
of
men
he
made
them
stronger
and
more
ready
with
the
spear
and
bow
jason
was
trained
by
chiron
as
heracles
just
before
him
had
been
trained
and
as
achilles
was
to
be
trained
afterward
moreover
chiron
taught
him
the
knowledge
of
the
stars
and
the
wisdom
that
had
to
do
with
the
ways
of
the
gods
once
when
they
were
hunting
together
jason
saw
a
form
at
the
end
of
an
alley
of
form
of
a
woman
it
a
woman
who
had
on
her
head
a
shining
crown
never
had
jason
dreamt
of
seeing
a
form
so
wondrous
not
very
near
did
he
come
but
he
thought
he
knew
that
the
woman
smiled
upon
him
she
was
seen
no
more
and
jason
knew
that
he
had
looked
upon
one
of
the
immortal
goddesses
all
day
jason
was
filled
with
thought
of
her
whom
he
had
seen
at
night
when
the
stars
were
out
and
when
they
were
seated
outside
the
cave
chiron
and
jason
talked
together
and
chiron
told
the
youth
that
she
whom
he
had
seen
was
none
other
than
hera
the
wife
of
zeus
who
had
for
his
father
æson
and
for
himself
an
especial
friendliness
so
jason
grew
up
upon
the
mountain
and
in
the
forest
fastnesses
when
he
had
reached
his
full
height
and
had
shown
himself
swift
in
the
hunt
and
strong
with
the
spear
and
bow
chiron
told
him
that
the
time
had
come
when
he
should
go
back
to
the
world
of
men
and
make
his
name
famous
by
the
doing
of
great
deeds
and
when
chiron
told
him
about
his
father
how
he
had
been
thrust
out
of
the
kingship
by
pelias
his
great
longing
came
upon
jason
to
see
his
father
and
a
fierce
anger
grew
up
in
his
heart
against
pelias
then
the
time
came
when
he
bade
to
chiron
his
great
instructor
the
time
came
when
he
went
from
the
centaur
s
cave
for
the
last
time
and
went
through
the
wooded
ways
and
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
pelion
he
came
to
the
river
to
the
swift
anaurus
and
he
found
it
high
in
flood
the
stones
by
which
one
might
cross
were
almost
all
washed
over
far
apart
did
they
seem
in
the
flood
now
as
he
stood
there
pondering
on
what
he
might
do
there
came
up
to
him
an
old
woman
who
had
on
her
back
a
load
of
brushwood
wouldst
thou
cross
asked
the
old
woman
wouldst
thou
cross
and
get
thee
to
the
city
of
iolcus
jason
where
so
many
things
await
thee
greatly
was
the
youth
astonished
to
hear
his
name
spoken
by
this
old
woman
and
to
hear
her
give
the
name
of
the
city
he
was
bound
for
wouldst
thou
cross
the
anaurus
she
asked
again
then
mount
upon
my
back
holding
on
to
the
wood
i
carry
and
i
will
bear
thee
over
the
jason
smiled
how
foolish
this
old
woman
was
to
think
that
she
could
bear
him
across
the
flooded
river
she
came
near
him
and
she
took
him
in
her
arms
and
lifted
him
up
on
her
shoulders
then
before
he
knew
what
she
was
about
to
do
she
had
stepped
into
the
water

stone

on

she
had
drawn
to

left
him

she
was
lifting
him
down

of
his
feet

the
water
the
swift
current
swept
away
a
sandal
he
stood
on
the
bank
knowing
that
she
who
had
carried
him
across
the
flooded
river
had
strength
from
the
gods
he
looked
upon
her
and
behold
she
was
transformed
instead
of
an
old
woman
there
stood
before
him
one
who
had
on
a
golden
robe
and
a
shining
crown
around
her
was
a
wondrous
light
of
the
sun
when
it
is
most
golden
then
jason
knew
that
she
who
had
carried
him
across
the
broad
anaurus
was
the
goddess
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
ways
of

and
in
whatever
chance
doth
befall
thee
act
as
one
who
has
the
eyes

immortals
upon
she
spoke
and
she
was

no
more
then
jason
went
on
his
way
to
the
city
that
cretheus
his
grandfather
had
founded
and
that
his
father
æson
had
once
ruled
over

first

day
king
pelias
walking
through
the
streets
of
his
city
saw
coming
toward
him
a
youth
who
was
half
shod
he
remembered
the
words
of
the
oracle
that
bade
him
beware
of
a
man
and
straightway
he
gave
orders
to
his
guards
to
lay
hands
upon
the
youth
but
the
guards
wavered
when
they
went
toward
him
for
there
was
something
about
the
youth
that
put
them
in
awe
of
him
he
came
with
the
guards
however
and
he
stood
before
the
king

judgment

fearfully
did
pelias
look
upon
him
but
not
fearfully
did
the

look
upon

he
cried

knew
that
the
youth
might
not
be
slain
he
bent
his
head
while
he
plotted
against
him
in
his
heart
then
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looking
upon
jason
he
said
o

pelias

and
jason
went
with
the
guards

the
crowd
of
people
and
he
came
to
the
palace
of
the
king
and
he
was
brought
within

him
to
the
bath
and
gave

jason
looked
a
prince
indeed
but
all
that
while
king
pelias
remained
on
his
judgment
seat
with
his
crowned
head
bent
down
when
he
raised
his
head
his
dark
brows
were
gathered
together
and
his
thin
lips
were
very
close
he
looked
to
the
swords
and
spears
of
his
guards
and
he
made
a
sign
to
the
men
to
stand
close
to
him
then
he
left
the
judgment
seat
and
he
went
to
the
palace
illustration
iii
the
golden
fleece
decorative
first
letter
brought
jason
into
a
hall
where
æson
his
father
waited
very
strange
did
this
old
and
man
appear
to
him
but
when
æson
spoke
jason
remembered
the
tone
of
his
father
s
voice
and
he
clasped
him
to
him
and
his
father
knew
him
even
without
the
sight
of
the
ruby
ring
which
jason
had
upon
his
finger
then
the
young
man
began
to
tell
of
the
centaur
and
of
his
life
upon
the
mountain
pelion
as
they
were
speaking
together
pelias
came
to
where
they
stood
pelias
in
the
purple
robe
of
a
king
and
with
the
crown
upon
his
head
æson
tightly
clasped
jason
as
if
he
had
become
fearful
for
his
son
pelias
smilingly
took
the
hand
of
the
young
man
and
the
hand
of
his
brother
and
he
bade
them
both
welcome
to
his
palace
then
walking
between
them
the
king
brought
the
two
into
the
feasting
hall
the
youth
who
had
known
only
the
forest
and
the
mountainside
had
to
wonder
at
the
beauty
and
the
magnificence
of
all
he
saw
around
him
on
the
walls
were
bright
pictures
the
tables
were
of
polished
wood
and
they
had
vessels
of
gold
and
dishes
of
silver
set
upon
them
along
the
walls
were
vases
of
lovely
shapes
and
colors
and
everywhere
there
were
baskets
heaped
with
roses
white
and
red
the
king
s
guests
were
already
in
the
hall
young
men
and
elders
and
maidens
went
amongst
them
carrying
roses
which
they
strung
into
wreaths
for
the
guests
to
put
upon
their
heads
a
maiden
gave
jason
a
wreath
of
roses
and
he
put
it
on
his
head
as
he
sat
down
at
the
king
s
table
when
he
looked
at
all
the
rich
and
lovely
things
in
that
hall
and
when
he
saw
the
guests
looking
at
him
with
friendly
eyes
jason
felt
that
he
was
indeed
far
away
from
the
dim
spaces
of
the
mountain
forest
and
from
the
darkness
of
the
centaur
s
cave
rich
food
and
wine
such
as
he
had
never
dreamt
of
tasting
were
brought
to
the
tables
he
ate
and
drank
and
his
eyes
followed
the
fair
maidens
who
went
through
the
hall
he
thought
how
glorious
it
was
to
be
a
king
he
heard
pelias
speak
to
æson
his
father
telling
him
that
he
was
old
and
that
he
was
weary
of
ruling
that
he
longed
to
make
friends
and
that
he
would
let
no
enmity
now
be
between
him
and
his
brother
and
he
heard
the
king
say
that
he
jason
was
young
and
courageous
and
that
he
would
call
upon
him
to
help
to
rule
the
land
and
that
in
a
while
jason
would
bear
full
sway
over
the
kingdom
that
cretheus
had
founded
so
pelias
spoke
to
æson
as
they
both
sat
together
at
the
king
s
high
table
but
jason
looking
on
them
both
saw
that
the
eyes
that
his
father
turned
on
him
were
full
of
warnings
and
mistrust
illustration
after
they
had
eaten
king
pelias
made
a
sign
and
a
bringing
a
richly
wrought
cup
came
and
stood
before
the
king
the
king
stood
up
holding
the
cup
in
his
hands
and
all
in
the
hall
waited
silently
then
pelias
put
the
cup
into
jason
s
hands
and
he
cried
out
in
a
voice
that
was
heard
all
through
the
hall
drink
from
this
cup
o
nephew
jason
drink
from
this
cup
o
man
who
will
soon
come
to
rule
over
the
kingdom
that
cretheus
founded
all
in
the
hall
stood
up
and
shouted
with
delight
at
that
speech
but
the
king
was
not
delighted
with
their
delight
jason
saw
he
took
the
cup
and
he
drank
the
rich
wine
pride
grew
in
him
he
looked
down
the
hall
and
he
saw
faces
all
friendly
to
him
he
felt
as
a
king
might
feel
secure
and
triumphant
and
then
he
heard
king
pelias
speaking
once
more
this
is
my
nephew
jason
reared
and
fostered
in
the
centaur
s
cave
he
will
tell
you
of
his
life
in
the
forest
and
the
life
that
was
like
to
the
life
of
the
half
then
jason
spoke
to
them
telling
them
of
his
life
on
the
mountain
pelion
when
he
had
spoken
pelias
said
i
was
bidden
by
the
oracle
to
beware
of
the
man
whom
i
should
see

toward
me
half
shod
but
as
you
all
see
i
have
brought
the
man
to
my
palace
and
my
feasting
hall
so
little
do
i
dread
the
anger
of
the
gods
and
i
dread
it
little
because
i
am
blameless
this
youth
the
son
of
my
brother
is
strong
and
courageous
and
i
rejoice
in
his
strength
and
courage
for
i
would
have
him
take
my
place
and
reign
over
you
ah
that
i
were
as
young
as
he
is
now
ah
that
i
had
been
reared
and
fostered
as
he
was
reared
and
fostered
by
the
wise
centaur
and
under
the
eyes
of
the
immortals
then
would
i
do
that
which
in
my
youth
i
often
dreamed
of
doing
then
would
i
perform
a
deed
that
would
make
my
name
and
the
name
of
my
city
famous
throughout
all
greece
then
would
i
bring

he
finished
speaking
and
all
in
the
hall
shouted
out
the
golden
fleece
the
golden
fleece
from
colchis
jason
stood
up
and
his
father
s
hand
gripped
him
but
he
did
not
heed
the
hold
of
his
father
s
hand
for
the
golden
fleece
the
golden
fleece
rang
in
his
ears
and
before
his
eyes
were
the
faces
of
those
who
were
all
eager
for
the
sight
of
the
wonder
that
king
æetes
kept
guard
over
then

any
one
who

strive
to
win
it
from
king
æetes
s
care
but

too
that
i
would
strive
to
win
the
fleece
and
bring
it
to
iolcus
winning
fame
both
for
myself
and
for
the
when
he
had
spoken
he
saw
his
father
s
stricken
eyes
they
were
fixed
upon
him
but
he
looked
from
them
to
the
shining
eyes
of
the
young
men
who
were
even
then
pressing
around
where
he
stood
jason
jason
they

golden
fleece
for
iolcus

the
winning
of
the
golden

jason
but
if

the
wonder
that
king
æetes
keeps
guard
he
spoke
and
those
in
the
hall
shouted
again
and
made
clamor
around
him
but
still
his
father
sat
gazing
at
him
with
stricken
eyes
king
pelias
stood
up
in
the
hall
and
holding
up
his
scepter
he
said

king
pelias
said
but
jason
looking
to
the
king
from
his
father
s
stricken
eyes
saw
that
he
had
been
led
by
the
king
into
the
acceptance
of
the
voyage
so
that
he
might
fare
far
from
iolcus
and
perhaps
lose
his
life
in
striving
to
gain
the
wonder
that
king
æetes
kept
guarded
by
the
glitter
in
pelias
s
eyes
he
knew
the
truth
nevertheless
jason
would
not
take
back
one
word
that
he
had
spoken
his
heart
was
strong
within
him
and
he
thought
that
with
the
help
of
the
youths
around
and
with
the
help
of
those
who
would
come
to
him
at
the

dodona
the
grove
of
zeus
a
sacred
power
was
in
the
beam
and
from
it
the
prow
of
the
ship
should
be
fashioned
jason
had
them
take
the
beam
from
the
roof
of
the
palace
it
was
brought
to
where
the
timbers
were
and
that
day
the
building
of
the
great
ship
was
begun
then
all
along
the
waterside
came
the
noise
of
hammering
in
the
street
where
the
metalworkers
were
came
the
noise
of
beating
upon
metals
as
the
smiths
fashioned
out
of
bronze
armor
for
the
heroes
and
swords
and
spears
every
day
under
the
eyes
of
argus
the
master
the
ship
that
had
in
it
the
beam
from
zeus
s
grove
was
built
higher
and
wider
and
those
who
were
building
the
ship
often
felt
going
through
it
tremors
as
of
a
living
creature
when
the
ship
was
built
and
made
ready
for
the
voyage
a
name
was
given
to
argo
it
was
called
and
naming
themselves
from
the
ship
the
heroes
called
themselves
the
argonauts
all
was
ready
for
the
voyage
and
now
jason
went
with
his
friends
to
view
the
ship
before
she
was
brought
into
the
water
argus
the
master
was
on
the
ship
seeing
to
it
that
the
last
things
were
being
done
before
was
launched
very
grave
and
wise
looked
the
builder
of
the
ship
and
wonderful
to
the
heroes
the
ship
looked
now
that
argus
for
their
viewing
had
set
up
the
mast
with
the
sails
and
had
even
put
the
oars
in
their
places
wonderful
to
the
heroes
looked
with
her
long
oars
and
her
high
sails
with
her
timbers
painted
red
and
gold
and
blue
and
with
a
marvelous
figure
carved
upon
her
prow
all
over
the
ship
jason
s
eyes
went
he
saw
a
figure
standing
by
the
mast
for
a
moment
he
looked
on
it
and
then
the
figure
became
shadowy
but
jason
knew
that
he
had
looked
upon
the
goddess
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
ways
of
the
forest
and
had
seen
afterward
by
the
rough
anaurus
then
mast
and
sails
were
taken
down
and
the
oars
were
left
in
the
ship
and
the
was
launched
into
the
water
the
heroes
went
back
to
the
palace
of
king
pelias
to
feast
with
the
king
s
guests
before
they
took
their
places
on
the
ship
setting
out
on
the
voyage
to
far
colchis
when
they
came
into
the
palace
they
saw
that
another
hero
had
arrived
his
shield
was
hung
in
the
hall
the
heroes
all
gathered
around
amazed
at
the
size
and
the
beauty
of
it
the
shield
shone
all
over
with
gold
in
its
center
was
the
figure
of
fear
that
stared
backward
with
eyes
burning
as
with
fire
the
mouth
was
open
and
the
teeth
were
shown
and
other
figures
were
wrought
around
the
figure
of
and
pursuit
and
flight
tumult
and
panic
and
slaughter
the
figure
of
fate
was
there
dragging
a
dead
man
by
the
feet
on
her
shoulders
fate
had
a
garment
that
was
red
with
the
blood
of
men
around
these
figures
were
heads
of
snakes
heads
with
black
jaws
and
glittering
eyes
twelve
heads
such
as
might
affright
any
man
and
on
other
parts
of
the
shield
were
shown
the
horses
of
ares
the
grim
god
of
war
the
figure
of
ares
himself
was
shown
also
he
held
a
spear
in
his
hand
and
he
was
urging
the
warriors
on
around
the
inner
rim
of
the
shield
the
sea
was
shown
wrought
in
white
metal
dolphins
swam
in
the
sea
fishing
for
little
fishes
that
were
shown
there
in
bronze
around
the
rim
chariots
were
racing
along
with
wheels
running
close
together
there
were
men
fighting
and
women
watching
from
high
towers
the
awful
figure
of
the
darkness
of
death
was
shown
there
too
with
mournful
eyes
and
the
dust
of
battles
upon
her
shoulders
the
outer
rim
of
the
shield
showed
the
stream
of
ocean
the
stream
that
encircles
the
world
swans
were
soaring
above
and
swimming
on
its
surface
all
in
wonder
the
heroes
gazed
on
the
great
shield
telling
each
other
that
only
one
man
in
all
the
world
could
carry
the
son
of
zeus
could
it
be
that
heracles
had
come
amongst
them
they
went
into
the
feasting
hall
and
they
saw
one
there
who
was
tall
as
a
pine
tree
with
unshorn
tresses
of
hair
upon
his
head
heracles
indeed
it
was
he
turned
to
them
a
smiling
face
with
smiling
eyes
heracles
they
all
gathered
around
the
strongest
hero
in
the
world
and
he
took
the
hand
of
each
in
his
mighty
hand
the
decorative
first
letter
heroes
went
the
next
day
through
the
streets
of
iolcus
down
to
where
the
ship
lay
the
ways
they
went
through
were
crowded
the
heroes
were
splendid
in
their
appearance
and
jason
amongst
them
shone
like
a
star
the
people
praised
him
and
one
told
the
other
that
it
would
not
be
long
until
they
would
win
back
to
iolcus
for
this
band
of
heroes
was
strong
enough
they
said
to
take
king
æetes
s
city
and
force
him
to
give
up
to
them
the
famous
fleece
of
gold
many
of
the
youths
of
iolcus
went
with
the
heroes
who
had
come
from
the
different
parts
of
greece
illustration
the
as
they
marched
past
a
temple
a
priestess
came
forth
to
speak
to
jason
iphias
was
her
name
she
had
a
prophecy
to
utter
about
the
voyage
but
iphias
was
very
old
and
she
stammered
in
her
speech
to
jason
what
she
said
was
not
heard
by
him
the
heroes
went
on
and
ancient
iphias
was
left
standing
there
as
the
old
are
left
by
the
young
the
heroes
went
aboard
the
they
took
their
seats
as
at
an
assembly
then
jason
faced
them
and
spoke
to
them
all
heroes
of
the
quest
said
jason
we
have
come
aboard
the
great
ship
that
argus
has
built
and
all
that
a
ship
needs
is
in
its
place
or
is
ready
to
our
hands
all
that
we
wait
for
now
is
the
coming
of
the
morning
s
breeze
that
will
set
us
on
our
way
for
far
colchis
one
thing
we
have
first
to
is
to
choose
a
leader
who
will
direct
us
all
one
who
will
settle
disputes
amongst
ourselves
and
who
will
make
treaties
between
us
and
the
strangers
that
we
come
amongst
we
must
choose
such
a
leader
jason
spoke
and
some
looked
to
him
and
some
looked
to
heracles
but
heracles
stood
up
and
stretching
out
his
hand
said
argonauts
let
no
one
amongst
you
offer
the
leadership
to
me
i
will
not
take
it
the
hero
who
brought
us
together
and
made
all
things
ready
for
our
is
he
and
no
one
else
who
should
be
our
leader
in
this
so
heracles
said
and
the
argonauts
all
stood
up
and
raised
a
cry
for
jason
then
jason
stepped
forward
and
he
took
the
hand
of
each
argonaut
in
his
hand
and
he
swore
that
he
would
lead
them
with
all
the
mind
and
all
the
courage
that
he
possessed
and
he
prayed
the
gods
that
it
would
be
given
to
him
to
lead
them
back
safely
with
the
golden
fleece
glittering
on
the
mast
of
the
they
drew
lots
for
the
benches
they
would
sit
at
they
took
the
places
that
for
the
length
of
the
voyage
they
would
have
on
the
ship
they
made
sacrifice
to
the
gods
and
they
waited
for
the
breeze
of
the
morning
that
would
help
them
away
from
iolcus
and
while
they
waited
æson
the
father
of
jason
sat
at
his
own
hearth
bowed
and
silent
in
his
grief
alcimide
his
wife
sat
near
him
but
she
was
not
silent
she
lamented
to
the
women
of
iolcus
who
were
gathered
around
her
i
did
not
go
down
to
the
ship
she
said
for
with
my
grief
i
would
not
be
a
bird
of
ill
omen
for
the
voyage
by
this
hearth
my
son
took
farewell
of
only
son
i
ever
bore
from
the
doorway
i
watched
him
go
down
the
street
of
the
city
and
i
heard
the
people
shout
as
he
went
amongst
them
they
glorying
in
my
son
s
splendid
appearance
ah
that
i
might
live
to
see
his
return
and
to
hear
the
shout
that
will
go
up
when
the
people
look
on
jason
again
but
i
know
that
my
life
will
not
be
spared
so
long
i
will
not
look
on
my
son
when
he
comes
back
from
the
dangers
he
will
run
in
the
quest
of
the
golden
then
the
women
of
iolcus
asked
her
to
tell
them
of
the
golden
fleece
and
alcimide
told
them
of
it
and
of
the
sorrows
that
were
upon
the
race
of
æolus
cretheus
the
father
of
æson
and
pelias
was
of
the
race
of
æolus
and
of
the
race
of
æolus
too
was
athamas
the
king
who
ruled
in
thebes
at
the
same
time
that
cretheus
ruled
in
iolcus
and
the
first
children
of
athamas
were
phrixus
and
helle
ah
phrixus
and
ah
helle
alcimide
lamented
what
griefs
you
have
brought
on
the
race
of
æolus
and
what
griefs
you
yourselves
suffered
the
evil
that
athamas
your
father
did
you
lives
to
be
a
curse
to
the
line
of
æolus
athamas
was
wedded
first
to
nephele
the
mother
of
phrixus
and
helle
the
youth
and
maiden
but
athamas
married
again
while
the
mother
of
these
children
was
still
living
and
ino
the
new
queen
drove
nephele
and
her
children
out
of
the
king
s
palace
and
now
was
nephele
most
unhappy
she
had
to
live
as
a
servant
and
her
children
were
servants
to
the
servants
of
the
palace
they
were
clad
in
rags
and
had
little
to
eat
and
they
were
beaten
often
by
the
servants
who
wished
to
win
the
favor
of
the
new
queen
but
although
they
wore
rags
and
had
menial
tasks
to
do
phrixus
and
helle
looked
the
children
of
a
queen
the
boy
was
tall
and
in
his
eyes
there
often
came
the
flash
of
power
and
the
girl
looked
as
if
she
would
grow
into
a
lovely
maiden
and
when
athamas
their
father
would
meet
them
by
chance
he
would
sigh
and
queen
ino
would
know
by
that
sigh
that
he
had
still
some
love
for
them
in
his
heart
afterward
she
would
have
to
use
all
the
power
she
possessed
to
win
the
king
back
from
thinking
upon
his
children
and
now
queen
ino
had
children
of
her
own
she
knew
that
the
people
reverenced
the
children
of
nephele
and
cared
nothing
for
her
children
and
because
she
knew
this
she
feared
that
when
athamas
died
phrixus
and
helle
the
children
of
nephele
would
be
brought
to
rule
in
thebes
then
she
and
her
children
would
be
made
to
change
places
with
them
this
made
queen
ino
think
on
ways
by
which
she
could
make
phrixus
and
helle
lose
their
lives
she
thought
long
upon
this
and
at
last
a
desperate
plan
came
into
her
mind
when
it
was
winter
she
went
amongst
the
women
of
the
countryside
and
she
gave
them
jewels
and
clothes
for
presents
then
she
asked
them
to
do
secretly
an
thing
she
asked
the
women
to
roast
over
their
fires
the
grains
that
had
been
left
for
seed
this
the
women
did
then
spring
came
on
and
the
men
sowed
in
the
fields
the
grain
that
had
been
roasted
over
the
fires
no
shoots
grew
up
as
the
spring
went
by
in
summer
there
was
no
waving
greenness
in
the
fields
autumn
came
and
there
was
no
grain
for
the
reaping
then
the
men
not
knowing
what
had
happened
went
to
king
athamas
and
told
him
that
there
would
be
famine
in
the
land
the
king
sent
to
the
temple
of
artemis
to
ask
how
the
people
might
be
saved
from
the
famine
and
the
guardians
of
the
temple
having
taken
gold
from
queen
ino
told
them
that
there
would
be
worse
and
worse
famine
and
that
all
the
people
of
thebes
would
die
of
hunger
unless
the
king
was
willing
to
make
a
great
sacrifice
when
the
king
asked
what
sacrifice
he
should
make
he
was
told
by
the
guardians
of
the
temple
that
he
must
sacrifice
to
the
goddess
his
two
children
phrixus
and
helle
those
who
were
around
the
king
to
save
themselves
from
famine
after
famine
clamored
to
have
the
children
sacrificed
athamas
to
save
his
people
consented
to
the
sacrifice
they
went
toward
the
king
s
palace
they
found
helle
by
the
bank
of
the
river
washing
clothes
they
took
her
and
bound
her
they
found
phrixus
half
naked
digging
in
a
field
and
they
took
him
too
and
bound
him
that
night
they
left
brother
and
sister
in
the
same
prison
helle
wept
over
phrixus
and
phrixus
wept
to
think
that
he
was
not
able
to
do
anything
to
save
his
sister
the
servants
of
the
palace
went
to
nephele
and
they
mocked
at
her
telling
her
that
her
children
would
be
sacrificed
on
the
morrow
nephele
nearly
went
wild
in
her
grief
and
then
suddenly
there
came
into
her
mind
the
thought
of
a
creature
that
might
be
a
helper
to
her
and
to
her
children
this
creature
was
a
ram
that
had
wings
and
a
wonderful
fleece
of
gold
the
god
of
the
sea
poseidon
had
sent
this
wonderful
ram
to
athamas
and
nephele
as
a
marriage
gift
and
the
ram
had
since
been
kept
in
a
special
fold
to
that
fold
nephele
went
she
spent
the
night
beside
the
ram
praying
for
its
help
the
morning
came
and
the
children
were
taken
from
their
prison
and
dressed
in
white
and
wreaths
were
put
upon
their
heads
to
mark
them
as
things
for
sacrifice
they
were
led
in
a
procession
to
the
temple
of
artemis
behind
that
procession
king
athamas
walked
his
head
bowed
in
shame
but
queen
ino
s
head
was
not
bowed
rather
she
carried
it
high
for
her
thought
was
all
upon
her
triumph
soon
phrixus
and
helle
would
be
dead
and
then
whatever
happened
her
own
children
would
reign
after
athamas
in
thebes
phrixus
and
helle
thinking
they
were
taking
their
last
look
at
the
sun
went
on
and
even
then
nephele
holding
the
horns
of
the
golden
ram
was
making
her
last
prayer
the
sun
rose
and
as
it
did
the
ram
spread
out
its
great
wings
and
flew
through
the
air
it
flew
to
the
temple
of
artemis
down
beside
the
altar
came
the
golden
ram
and
it
stood
with
its
horns
threatening
those
who
came
all
stopped
in
surprise
still
the
ram
stood
with
threatening
head
and
great
golden
wings
spread
out
then
phrixus
ran
from
those
who
were
holding
him
and
laid
his
hands
upon
the
ram
he
called
to
helle
and
she
too
came
to
the
golden
creature
phrixus
mounted
on
the
ram
and
he
pulled
helle
up
beside
him
then
the
golden
ram
flew
upward
up
up
it
went
and
with
the
children
upon
its
back
it
became
like
a
star
in
the
sky
then
queen
ino
seeing
the
children
saved
by
the
golden
ram
shrieked
and
fled
away
from
that
place
athamas
ran
after
her
as
she
ran
and
as
he
followed
hatred
for
her
grew
up
within
him
ino
ran
on
and
on
until
she
came
to
the
cliffs
that
rose
over
the
sea
fearing
athamas
who
came
behind
her
she
plunged
down
but
as
she
fell
she
was
changed
by
poseidon
the
god
of
the
sea
she
became
a
seagull
athamas
who
followed
her
was
changed
also
he
became
the
sea
eagle
that
with
beak
and
talons
ever
ready
to
strike
flies
above
the
sea
and
the
golden
ram
with
wings
outspread
flew
on
and
on
over
the
sea
it
flew
while
the
wind
whistled
around
the
children
on
and
on
they
went
and
the
children
saw
only
the
blue
sea
beneath
them
then
poor
helle
looking
downward
grew
dizzy
she
fell
off
the
golden
ram
before
her
brother
could
take
hold
of
her
down
she
fell
and
still
the
ram
flew
on
and
on
she
was
drowned
in
that
sea
the
people
afterward
named
it
in
memory
of
her
calling
it
hellespont
helle
s
on
and
on
the
ram
flew
over
a
wild
and
barren
country
it
flew
and
toward
a
river
upon
that
river
a
white
city
was
built
down
the
ram
flew
and
alighting
on
the
ground
stood
before
the
gate
of
that
city
it
was
the
city
of
aea
in
the
land
of
colchis
the
king
was
in
the
street
of
the
city
and
he
joined
with
the
crowd
that
gathered
around
the
strange
golden
creature
that
had
a
youth
upon
its
back
the
ram
folded
its
wings
and
then
the
youth
stood
beside
it
he
spoke
to
the
people
and
then
the
was
his
to
him
asking
him
from
what
place
he
had
come
and
what
was
the
strange
creature
upon
whose
back
he
had
flown
to
the
king
and
to
the
people
phrixus
told
his
story
weeping
to
tell
of
helle
and
her
fall
then
king
æetes
brought
him
into
the
city
and
he
gave
him
a
place
in
the
palace
and
for
the
golden
ram
he
had
a
special
fold
made
soon
after
the
ram
died
and
then
king
æetes
took
its
golden
fleece
and
hung
it
upon
an
oak
tree
that
was
in
a
place
dedicated
to
ares
the
god
of
war
phrixus
wed
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
king
and
men
say
that
afterward
he
went
back
to
thebes
his
own
land
and
as
for
the
golden
fleece
it
became
the
greatest
of
king
æetes
s
treasures
well
indeed
does
he
guard
it
and
not
with
armed
men
only
but
with
magic
powers
very
strong
and
very
cunning
is
king
æetes
and
a
terrible
task
awaits
those
who
would
take
away
from
him
that
fleece
of
so
alcimide
spoke
sorrowfully
telling
to
the
women
the
story
of
the
golden
fleece
that
her
son
jason
was
going
in
quest
of
so
she
spoke
and
the
night
waned
and
the
morning
of
the
sailing
of
the
came
on
and
when
the
argonauts
beheld
the
dawn
upon
the
high
peaks
of
pelion
they
arose
and
poured
out
wine
in
offering
to
zeus
the
highest
of
the
gods
then
herself
gave
forth
a
strange
cry
for
the
beam
from
dodona
that
had
been
formed
into
her
prow
had
endued
her
with
life
she
uttered
a
strange
cry
and
as
she
did
the
heroes
took
their
places
at
the
benches
one
after
the
other
as
had
been
arranged
by
lot
and
tiphys
the
helmsman
went
to
the
steering
place
to
the
sound
of
orpheus
s
lyre
they
smote
with
oars
the
rushing
sea
water
and
the
surge
broke
over
the
oar
blades
the
sails
were
let
out
and
the
breeze
came
into
them
piping
shrilly
and
the
fishes
came
darting
through
the
green
sea
great
and
small
and
followed
them
gamboling
along
the
watery
paths
and
chiron
the
came
down
from
the
mountain
pelion
and
standing
with
his
feet
in
the
foam
cried
out
good
speed
o
argonauts
good
speed
and
a
sorrowless
the
beginning
of
things
orpheus
sang
to
his
lyre
orpheus
the
minstrel
who
knew
the
ways
and
the
stories
of
the
gods
out
in
the
open
sea
on
the
first
morning
of
the
voyage
orpheus
sang
to
them
of
the
beginning
of
things
he
sang
how
at
first
earth
and
heaven
and
sea
were
all
mixed
and
mingled
together
there
was
neither
light
nor
darkness
then
but
only
a
dimness
this
was
chaos
and
from
chaos
came
forth
night
and
erebus
from
night
was
born
æther
the
upper
air
and
from
night
and
erebus
wedded
there
was
born
day
and
out
of
chaos
came
earth
and
out
of
earth
came
the
starry
heaven
and
from
heaven
and
earth
wedded
there
were
born
the
titan
gods
and
cœus
crius
hyperion
iapetus
theia
rhea
themis
mnemosyne
phœbe
and
lovely
tethys
and
then
heaven
and
earth
had
for
their
child
cronos
the
most
cunning
of
all
cronos
wedded
rhea
and
from
cronos
and
rhea
were
born
the
gods
who
were
different
from
the
titan
gods
but
heaven
and
earth
had
other
briareus
and
gyes
these
were
giants
each
with
fifty
heads
and
a
hundred
arms
and
heaven
grew
fearful
when
he
looked
on
these
giant
children
and
he
hid
them
away
in
the
deep
places
of
the
earth
cronos
hated
heaven
his
father
he
drove
heaven
his
father
and
earth
his
mother
far
apart
and
far
apart
they
stay
for
they
have
never
been
able
to
come
near
each
other
since
and
cronos
married
to
rhea
had
for
children
hestia
demeter
hera
aidoneus
and
poseidon
and
these
all
belonged
to
the
company
of
the
deathless
gods
cronos
was
fearful
that
one
of
his
sons
would
treat
him
as
he
had
treated
heaven
his
father
so
when
another
child
was
born
to
him
and
his
wife
rhea
he
commanded
that
the
child
be
given
to
him
so
that
he
might
swallow
him
but
rhea
wrapped
a
great
stone
in
swaddling
clothes
and
gave
the
stone
to
cronos
and
cronos
swallowed
the
stone
thinking
to
swallow
his
child
that
child
was
zeus
earth
took
zeus
and
hid
him
in
a
deep
cave
and
those
who
minded
and
nursed
the
child
beat
upon
drums
so
that
his
cries
might
not
be
heard
his
nurse
was
adrastia
when
he
was
able
to
play
she
gave
him
a
ball
to
play
with
all
of
gold
was
the
ball
with
a
spiral
around
it
when
the
boy
zeus
would
play
with
this
ball
it
would
make
a
track
across
the
sky
flaming
like
a
star
hyperion
the
titan
god
wed
theia
the
titan
goddess
and
their
children
were
helios
the
bright
sun
and
selene
the
clear
moon
and
cœus
wed
phœbe
and
their
children
were
leto
who
is
kind
to
gods
and
men
and
asteria
of
happy
name
and
hecate
whom
zeus
honored
above
all
now
the
gods
who
were
the
children
of
cronos
and
rhea
went
up
unto
the
mountain
olympus
and
there
they
built
their
shining
palaces
but
the
titan
gods
who
were
born
of
heaven
and
earth
went
up
to
the
mountain
othrys
and
there
they
had
their
thrones
between
the
olympians
and
the
titan
gods
of
othrys
a
war
began
neither
side
might
prevail
against
the
other
but
now
zeus
grown
up
to
be
a
youth
thought
of
how
he
might
help
the
olympians
to
overthrow
the
titan
gods
he
went
down
into
the
deep
parts
of
the
earth
where
the
giants
cottus
briareus
and
gyes
had
been
hidden
by
their
father
cronos
had
bound
them
weighing
them
down
with
chains
but
now
zeus
loosed
them
and
the
giants
in
their
gratitude
gave
him
the
lightning
and
showed
him
how
to
use
the
thunderbolt
zeus
would
have
the
giants
fight
against
the
titan
gods
but
although
they
had
mighty
strength
cottus
briareus
and
gyes
had
no
fire
of
courage
in
their
hearts
zeus
thought
of
a
way
to
give
them
this
courage
he
brought
the
food
and
drink
of
the
gods
to
them
ambrosia
and
nectar
and
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
their
spirits
grew
within
the
giants
and
they
were
ready
to
make
war
upon
the
titan
gods
sons
of
earth
and
heaven
said
zeus
to
the
giants
a
long
time
now
have
the
dwellers
on
olympus
been
striving
with
the
titan
gods
do
you
lend
your
unconquerable
might
to
the
gods
and
help
them
to
overthrow
the
cottus
the
eldest
of
the
giants
answered
divine
one
through
your
devising
we
are
come
back
again
from
the
murky
gloom
of
the
mid
earth
and
we
have
escaped
from
the
hard
bonds
that
cronus
laid
upon
us
our
minds
are
fixed
to
aid
you
in
the
war
against
the
titan
so
the
giants
said
and
thereupon
zeus
went
and
he
gathered
around
him
all
who
were
born
of
cronos
and
rhea
cronos
himself
hid
from
zeus
then
the
giants
with
their
fifty
heads
growing
from
their
shoulders
and
their
hundred
hands
went
forth
against
the
titan
gods
the
boundless
sea
rang
terribly
and
the
earth
crashed
loudly
wide
heaven
was
shaken
and
groaned
and
high
olympus
reeled
from
its
foundation
holding
huge
rocks
in
their
hands
the
giants
attacked
the
titan
gods
then
zeus
entered
the
war
he
hurled
the
lightning
the
bolts
flew
thick
and
fast
from
his
strong
hand
with
thunder
and
lightning
and
flame
the
earth
crashed
around
in
burning
the
forests
crackled
with
fire
the
ocean
seethed
and
hot
flames
wrapped
the
titans
all
around
three
hundred
rocks
one
upon
another
did
cottus
briareus
and
gyes
hurl
upon
the
titans
and
when
their
ranks
were
broken
the
giants
seized
upon
them
and
held
them
for
zeus
but
some
of
the
titan
gods
seeing
that
the
strife
for
them
was
vain
went
over
to
the
side
of
zeus
these
zeus
became
friendly
with
but
the
other
titans
he
bound
in
chains
and
he
hurled
them
down
to
tartarus
as
far
as
earth
is
from
heaven
so
is
tartarus
from
earth
a
brazen
anvil
falling
down
from
heaven
to
earth
nine
days
and
nine
nights
would
reach
the
earth
upon
the
tenth
day
and
again
a
brazen
anvil
falling
from
earth
nine
nights
and
nine
days
would
reach
tartarus
upon
the
tenth
night
around
tartarus
runs
a
fence
of
bronze
and
night
spreads
in
a
triple
line
all
about
it
as
a
necklace
circles
the
neck
there
zeus
imprisoned
the
titan
gods
who
had
fought
against
him
they
are
hidden
in
the
misty
gloom
in
a
dank
place
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
they
may
not
go
out
for
poseidon
fixed
gates
of
bronze
upon
their
prison
and
a
wall
runs
all
round
it
there
cottus
briareus
and
gyes
stay
guarding
them
and
there
too
is
the
home
of
night
night
and
day
meet
each
other
at
that
place
as
they
pass
a
threshold
of
bronze
they
draw
near
and
they
greet
one
another
but
the
house
never
holds
them
both
together
for
while
one
is
about
to
go
down
into
the
house
the
other
is
leaving
through
the
door
one
holds
light
in
her
hand
and
the
other
holds
in
her
arms
sleep
there
the
children
of
dark
night
have
their
and
death
his
brother
the
sun
never
shines
upon
these
two
sleep
may
roam
over
the
wide
earth
and
come
upon
the
sea
and
he
is
kindly
to
men
but
death
is
not
kindly
and
whoever
he
seizes
upon
him
he
holds
fast
there
too
stands
the
hall
of
the
lord
of
the
underworld
aidoneus
the
brother
of
zeus
zeus
gave
him
the
underworld
to
be
his
dominion
when
he
shared
amongst
the
olympians
the
world
that
cronos
had
ruled
over
a
fearful
hound
guards
the
hall
of
aidoneus
cerberus
he
is
called
he
has
three
heads
on
those
who
go
within
that
hall
cerberus
fawns
but
on
those
who
would
come
out
of
it
he
springs
and
would
devour
them
not
all
the
titans
did
zeus
send
down
to
tartarus
those
of
them
who
had
wisdom
joined
him
and
by
their
wisdom
zeus
was
able
to
overcome
cronos
then
cronos
went
to
live
with
the
friendly
titan
gods
while
zeus
reigned
over
olympus
becoming
the
ruler
of
gods
and
men
so
orpheus

decorative
first
letter
the
places
that
the
argonauts
came
nigh
to
and
went
past
need
not
be
where
they
escaped
a
stormy
beach
homole
from
where
they
were
able
to
look
on
ossa
and
holy
olympus
lemnos
the
island
that
they
were
to
return
to
the
unnamed
country
where
the
men
abide
each
having
six
arms
two
growing
from
his
shoulders
and
four
fitting
close
to
his
terrible
sides
and
then
the
mountain
of
the
bears
where
they
climbed
to
make
sacrifice
there
to
rhea
the
mighty
mother
of
the
gods
afterward
for
a
whole
day
no
wind
blew
and
the
sail
of
the
hung
slack
but
the
heroes
swore
to
each
other
that
they
would
make
their
ship
go
as
swiftly
as
if
the
steeds
of
poseidon
were
racing
to
overtake
her
mightily
they
labored
at
the
oars
and
no
one
would
be
first
to
leave
his
rower
s
bench
and
then
just
as
the
breeze
of
the
evening
came
up
and
just
as
the
rest
of
the
heroes
were
leaning
back
spent
with
their
labor
the
oar
that
heracles
still
pulled
at
broke
and
half
of
it
was
carried
away
by
the
waves
heracles
sat
there
in
ill
humor
for
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
his
unlaboring
hands
all
through
the
night
they
went
on
with
a
good
breeze
filling
their
sails
and
next
day
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
cius
there
they
landed
so
that
heracles
might
get
himself
an
oar
no
sooner
did
they
set
their
feet
upon
the
shore
than
the
hero
went
off
into
the
forest
to
pull
up
a
tree
that
he
might
shape
into
an
oar
where
they
had
landed
was
near
to
the
country
of
the
bebrycians
a
rude
people
whose
king
was
named
amycus
now
while
heracles
was
away
from
them
this
king
came
with
his
rude
men
all
armed
with
clubs
down
to
where
the
argonauts
were
lighting
their
fires
on
the
beach
he
did
not
greet
them
courteously
asking
them
what
manner
of
men
they
were
and
whither
they
were
bound
nor
did
he
offer
them
hospitality
instead
he
shouted
at
them
insolently
listen
to
something
that
you
rovers
had
better
know
i
am
amycus
and
any
stranger
that
comes
to
this
land
has
to
get
into
a
boxing
bout
with
me
that
s
the
law
that
i
have
laid
down
unless
you
have
one
amongst
you
who
can
stand
up
to
me
you
won
t
be
let
go
back
to
your
ship
if
you
don
t
heed
my
law
look
out
for
something
s
going
to
happen
to
so
he
shouted
that
insolent
king
and
his
followers
raised
their
clubs
and
growled
approval
of
what
their
master
said
but
the
argonauts
were
not
dismayed
at
the
words
of
amycus
one
of
them
stepped
toward
the
bebrycians
he
was
polydeuces
good
at
boxing
offer
us
no
violence
king
said
polydeuces
we
are
ready
to
obey
the
law
that
you
have
laid
down
willingly
do
i
take
up
your
challenge
and
i
will
box
a
bout
with
the
argonauts
cheered
when
they
saw
polydeuces
the
good
boxer
step
forward
and
when
they
heard
what
he
had
to
say
amycus
turned
and
shouted
to
his
followers
and
one
of
them
brought
up
two
pairs
of
boxing
rough
cowhide
they
were
the
argonauts
feared
that
polydeuces
hands
might
have
been
made
numb
with
pulling
at
the
oar
and
some
of
them
went
to
him
and
took
his
hands
and
rubbed
them
to
make
them
supple
others
took
from
off
his
shoulders
his
beautifully
colored
mantle
amycus
straightway
put
on
his
gauntlets
and
threw
off
his
mantle
he
stood
there
amongst
his
followers
with
his
great
arms
crossed
glowering
at
the
argonauts
as
a
wild
beast
might
glower
and
when
the
two
faced
each
other
amycus
seemed
like
one
of
the
men
dark
and
hugely
shaped
while
helen
s
brother
stood
there
light
and
beautiful
polydeuces
was
like
that
star
whose
beams
are
lovely
at
illustration
like
the
wave
that
breaks
over
a
ship
and
gives
the
sailors
no
respite
amycus
came
on
at
polydeuces
he
pushed
in
upon
him
thinking
to
bear
him
down
and
overwhelm
him
but
as
the
skillful
steersman
keeps
the
ship
from
being
overwhelmed
by
the
monstrous
wave
so
polydeuces
all
skill
and
lightness
baffled
the
rushes
of
amycus
at
last
amycus
standing
on
the
tips
of
his
toes
and
rising
high
above
him
tried
to
bring
down
his
great
fist
upon
the
head
of
polydeuces
the
hero
swung
aside
and
took
the
blow
on
his
shoulder
then
he
struck
his
blow
it
was
a
strong
one
and
under
it
the
king
of
the
bebrycians
staggered
and
fell
down
you
see
said
polydeuces
that
we
keep
your
the
argonauts
shouted
but
the
rude
bebrycians
raised
their
clubs
to
rush
upon
them
then
would
the
heroes
have
been
hard
pressed
and
forced
perhaps
to
get
back
to
the
but
suddenly
heracles
appeared
amongst
them
coming
up
from
the
forest
he
carried
a
pine
tree
in
his
hands
with
all
its
branches
still
upon
it
and
seeing
this
man
appear
with
the
great
tree
in
his
hands
the
bebrycians
hurried
off
carrying
their
fallen
king
with
them
then
the
argonauts
gathered
around
polydeuces
saluted
him
as
their
champion
and
put
a
crown
of
victory
upon
his
head
heracles
meanwhile
lopped
off
the
branches
of
the
pine
tree
and
began
to
fashion
it
into
an
oar
the
fires
were
lighted
upon
the
shore
and
the
thoughts
of
all
were
turned
to
supper
then
young
hylas
who
used
to
sit
by
heracles
and
keep
bright
the
hero
s
arms
and
armor
took
a
bronze
vessel
and
went
to
fetch
water
never
was
there
a
boy
so
beautiful
as
young
hylas
he
had
golden
curls
that
tumbled
over
his
brow
he
had
deep
blue
eyes
and
a
face
that
smiled
at
every
glance
that
was
given
him
at
every
word
that
was
said
to
him
now
as
he
walked
through
the
flowering
grasses
with
his
knees
bare
and
with
the
bright
vessel
swinging
in
his
hand
he
looked
most
lovely
heracles
had
brought
the
boy
with
him
from
the
country
of
the
dryopians
he
would
have
him
sit
beside
him
on
the
bench
of
the
and
the
ill
humors
that
often
came
upon
him
would
go
at
the
words
and
the
smile
of
hylas
now
the
spring
that
hylas
was
going
toward
was
called
pegæ
and
it
was
haunted
by
the
nymphs
they
were
dancing
around
it
when
they
heard
hylas
singing
they
stole
softly
off
to
watch
him
hidden
behind
trees
the
nymphs
saw
the
boy
come
near
and
they
felt
such
love
for
him
that
they
thought
they
could
never
let
him
go
from
their
sight
they
stole
back
to
their
spring
and
they
sank
down
below
its
clear
surface
then
came
hylas
singing
a
song
that
he
had
heard
from
his
mother
he
bent
down
to
the
spring
and
the
brimming
water
flowed
into
the
sounding
bronze
of
the
pitcher
then
hands
came
out
of
the
water
one
of
the
nymphs
caught
hylas
by
the
elbow
another
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
another
took
the
hand
that
held
the
vessel
of
bronze
the
pitcher
sank
down
to
the
depths
of
the
spring
the
hands
of
the
nymphs
clasped
hylas
tighter
tighter
the
water
bubbled
around
him
as
they
drew
him
down
down
down
they
drew
him
and
into
the
cold
and
glimmering
cave
where
they
live
illustration
hylas
there
hylas
stayed
but
although
the
nymphs
kissed
him
and
sang
to
him
and
showed
him
lovely
things
hylas
was
not
content
to
be
there
where
the
argonauts
were
the
fires
burned
the
moon
arose
and
still
hylas
did
not
return
then
they
began
to
fear
lest
a
wild
beast
had
destroyed
the
boy
one
went
to
heracles
and
told
him
that
young
hylas
had
not
come
back
and
that
they
were
fearful
for
him
heracles
flung
down
the
pine
tree
that
he
was
fashioning
into
an
oar
and
he
dashed
along
the
way
that
hylas
had
gone
as
if
a
gadfly
were
stinging
him
hylas
hylas
he
cried
but
hylas
in
the
cold
and
glimmering
cave
that
the
nymphs
had
drawn
him
into
did
not
hear
the
call
of
his
friend
heracles
all
the
argonauts
went
searching
calling
as
they
went
through
the
island
hylas
hylas
hylas
but
only
their
own
calls
came
back
to
them
the
morning
star
came
up
and
tiphys
the
steersman
called
to
them
from
the
and
when
they
came
to
the
ship
tiphys
told
them
that
they
would
have
to
go
aboard
and
make
ready
to
sail
from
that
place
they
called
to
heracles
and
heracles
at
last
came
down
to
the
ship
they
spoke
to
him
saying
that
they
would
have
to
sail
away
heracles
would
not
go
on
board
i
will
not
leave
this
island
he
said
until
i
find
young
hylas
or
learn
what
has
happened
to
then
jason
arose
to
give
the
command
to
depart
but
before
the
words
were
said
telamon
stood
up
and
faced
him
jason
he
said
angrily
you
do
not
bid
heracles
come
on
board
and
you
would
have
the
leave
without
him
you
would
leave
heracles
here
so
that
he
may
not
be
with
us
on
the
quest
where
his
glory
might
overshadow
your
glory
jason
said
no
word
but
he
sat
back
on
his
bench
with
head
bowed
and
then
even
as
telamon
said
these
angry
words
a
strange
figure
rose
up
out
of
the
waves
of
the
sea
it
was
the
figure
of
a
man
wrinkled
and
old
with
seaweed
in
his
beard
and
his
hair
there
was
a
majesty
about
him
and
the
argonauts
all
knew
that
this
was
one
of
the
was
nereus
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
to
heracles
and
to
you
the
rest
of
the
argonauts
i
have
a
thing
to
say
said
the
ancient
one
nereus
know
first
that
hylas
has
been
taken
by
the
nymphs
who
love
him
and
who
think
to
win
his
love
and
that
he
will
stay
forever
with
them
in
their
cold
and
glimmering
cave
for
hylas
seek
no
more
and
to
you
heracles
i
will
say
this
go
aboard
the
again
the
ship
will
take
you
to
where
a
great
labor
awaits
you
and
which
in
accomplishing
you
will
work
out
the
will
of
zeus
you
will
know
what
this
labor
is
when
a
spirit
seizes
on
so
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
said
and
he
sank
back
beneath
the
waves
heracles
went
aboard
the
once
more
and
he
took
his
place
on
the
bench
the
new
oar
in
his
hand
sad
he
was
to
think
that
young
hylas
who
used
to
sit
at
his
knee
would
never
be
there
again
the
breeze
filled
the
sail
the
argonauts
pulled
at
the
oars
and
in
sadness
they
watched
the
island
where
young
hylas
had
been
lost
to
them
recede
from
their
view
vii
king
phineus
decorative
first
letter
tiphys
the
steersman
if
we
could
enter
the
sea
of
pontus
we
could
make
our
way
across
that
sea
to
colchis
in
a
short
time
but
the
passage
into
the
sea
of
pontus
is
most
perilous
and
few
mortals
dare
even
to
make
approach
to
said
jason
the
chieftain
of
the
host
the
dangers
of
the
passage
tiphys
we
have
spoken
of
and
it
may
be
that
we
shall
have
to
carry
overland
to
the
sea
of
pontus
but
you
tiphys
have
spoken
of
a
wise
king
who
is
hereabouts
and
who
might
help
us
to
make
the
dangerous
passage
speak
again
to
us
and
tell
us
what
the
dangers
of
the
passage
are
and
who
the
king
is
who
may
be
able
to
help
us
to
make
these
dangers
then
said
tiphys
the
steersman
of
the
no
ship
sailed
by
mortals
has
as
yet
gone
through
the
passage
that
brings
this
sea
into
the
sea
of
pontus
in
the
way
are
the
rocks
that
mariners
call
the
clashers
these
rocks
are
not
fixed
as
rocks
should
be
but
they
rush
one
against
the
other
dashing
up
the
sea
and
crushing
whatever
may
be
between
yea
if
were
of
iron
and
if
she
were
between
these
rocks
when
they
met
she
would
be
crushed
to
bits
i
have
sailed
as
far
as
that
passage
but
seeing
the
clashers
strike
together
i
turned
back
my
ship
and
journeyed
as
far
as
the
sea
of
pontus
overland
but
i
have
been
told
of
one
who
knows
how
a
ship
may
be
taken
through
the
passage
that
the
clashers
make
so
perilous
he
who
knows
is
a
king
hereabouts
phineus
who
has
made
himself
as
wise
as
the
gods
to
no
one
has
phineus
told
how
the
passage
may
be
made
but
knowing
what
high
favor
has
been
shown
to
us
the
argonauts
it
may
be
that
he
will
tell
so
tiphys
said
and
jason
commanded
him
to
steer
the
toward
the
city
where
ruled
phineus
the
wise
king
to
salmydessus
then
where
phineus
ruled
tiphys
steered
the
they
left
heracles
with
tiphys
aboard
to
guard
the
ship
and
with
the
rest
of
the
heroes
jason
went
through
the
streets
of
the
city
they
met
many
men
but
when
they
asked
any
of
them
how
they
might
come
to
the
palace
of
king
phineus
the
men
turned
fearfully
away
they
found
their
way
to
the
king
s
palace
jason
spoke
to
the
servants
and
bade
them
tell
the
king
of
their
coming
the
servants
too
seemed
fearful
and
as
jason
and
his
comrades
were
wondering
what
there
was
about
him
that
made
men
fearful
at
his
name
phineus
the
king
came
amongst
them
were
it
not
that
he
had
a
purple
border
to
his
robe
no
one
would
have
known
him
for
the
king
so
miserable
did
this
man
seem
he
crept
along
touching
the
walls
for
the
eyes
in
his
head
were
blind
and
withered
his
body
was
shrunken
and
when
he
stood
before
them
leaning
on
his
staff
he
was
like
to
a
lifeless
thing
he
turned
his
blinded
eyes
upon
them
looking
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
he
were
searching
for
a
face
then
his
sightless
eyes
rested
upon
zetes
and
calais
the
sons
of
boreas
the
north
wind
a
change
came
into
his
face
as
it
turned
upon
them
one
would
think
that
he
saw
the
wonder
that
these
two
were
endowed
wings
that
grew
upon
their
ankles
it
was
a
while
before
he
turned
his
face
from
them
then
he
spoke
to
jason
and
said
you
have
come
to
have
counsel
with
one
who
has
the
wisdom
of
the
gods
others
before
you
have
come
for
such
counsel
but
seeing
the
misery
that
is
visible
upon
me
they
went
without
asking
for
counsel
i
would
strive
to
hold
you
here
for
a
while
stay
and
have
sight
of
the
misery
the
gods
visit
upon
those
who
would
be
as
wise
as
they
and
when
you
have
seen
the
thing
that
is
wont
to
befall
me
it
may
be
that
help
will
come
from
you
for
then
phineus
the
blind
king
left
them
and
after
a
while
the
heroes
were
brought
into
a
great
hall
and
they
were
invited
to
rest
themselves
there
while
a
banquet
was
being
prepared
for
them
the
hall
was
richly
adorned
but
it
looked
to
the
heroes
as
if
it
had
known
strange
happenings
rich
hangings
were
strewn
upon
the
ground
an
ivory
chair
was
overturned
and
the
dais
where
the
king
sat
had
stains
upon
it
the
servants
who
went
through
the
hall
making
ready
the
banquet
were
and
fearful
the
feast
was
laid
on
a
great
table
and
the
heroes
were
invited
to
sit
down
to
it
the
king
did
not
come
into
the
hall
before
they
sat
down
but
a
table
with
food
was
set
before
the
dais
when
the
heroes
had
feasted
the
king
came
into
the
hall
he
sat
at
the
table
blind
and
shrunken
and
the
argonauts
all
turned
their
faces
to
him
said
phineus
the
blind
king
you
see
o
heroes
how
much
my
wisdom
avails
me
you
see
me
blind
and
shrunken
who
tried
to
make
myself
in
wisdom
equal
to
the
gods
and
yet
you
have
not
seen
all
watch
now
and
see
what
feasts
phineus
the
wise
king
has
to
delight
he
made
a
sign
and
the
and
trembling
servants
brought
food
and
set
it
upon
the
table
that
was
before
him
the
king
bent
forward
as
if
to
eat
and
they
saw
that
his
face
was
covered
with
the
damp
of
fear
he
took
food
from
the
dish
and
raised
it
to
his
mouth
as
he
did
the
doors
of
the
hall
were
flung
open
as
if
by
a
storm
strange
shapes
flew
into
the
hall
and
set
themselves
beside
the
king
and
when
the
argonauts
looked
upon
them
they
saw
that
these
were
terrible
and
unsightly
shapes
illustration
they
were
things
that
had
the
wings
and
claws
of
birds
and
the
heads
of
women
black
hair
and
gray
feathers
were
mixed
upon
them
they
had
red
eyes
and
streaks
of
blood
were
upon
their
breasts
and
wings
and
as
the
king
raised
the
food
to
his
mouth
they
flew
at
him
and
buffeted
his
head
with
their
wings
and
snatched
the
food
from
his
hands
then
they
devoured
or
scattered
what
was
upon
the
table
and
all
the
time
they
screamed
and
laughed
and
mocked
ah
now
ye
see
phineus
panted
what
it
is
to
have
wisdom
equal
to
the
wisdom
of
the
gods
now
ye
all
see
my
misery
never
do
i
strive
to
put
food
to
my
lips
but
these
foul
things
the
harpies
the
snatchers
swoop
down
and
scatter
or
devour
what
i
would
eat
crumbs
they
leave
me
that
my
life
may
not
altogether
go
from
me
but
these
crumbs
they
make
foul
to
my
taste
and
my
and
one
of
the
harpies
perched
herself
on
the
back
of
the
king
s
throne
and
looked
upon
the
heroes
with
red
eyes
hah
she
screamed
you
bring
armed
men
into
your
feasting
hall
thinking
to
scare
us
away
never
phineus
can
you
scare
us
from
you
always
you
will
have
us
the
snatchers
beside
you
when
you
would
still
your
ache
of
hunger
what
can
these
men
do
against
us
who
are
winged
and
who
can
travel
through
the
ways
of
the
air
so
said
the
unsightly
harpy
and
the
heroes
drew
together
made
fearful
by
these
awful
shapes
all
drew
back
except
zetes
and
calais
the
sons
of
the
north
wind
they
laid
their
hands
upon
their
swords
the
wings
on
their
shoulders
spread
out
and
the
wings
at
their
heels
trembled
phineus
the
king
leaned
forward
and
panted
by
the
wisdom
i
have
i
know
that
there
are
two
amongst
you
who
can
save
me
o
make
haste
to
help
me
ye
who
can
help
me
and
i
will
give
the
counsel
that
you
argonauts
have
come
to
me
for
and
besides
i
will
load
down
your
ship
with
treasure
and
costly
stuffs
oh
make
haste
ye
who
can
help
me
hearing
the
king
speak
like
this
the
harpies
gathered
together
and
gnashed
with
their
teeth
and
chattered
to
one
another
then
seeing
zetes
and
calais
with
their
hands
upon
their
swords
they
rose
up
on
their
wings
and
flew
through
the
wide
doors
of
the
hall
the
king
cried
out
to
zetes
and
calais
but
the
sons
of
the
north
wind
had
already
risen
with
their
wings
and
they
were
after
the
harpies
their
bright
swords
in
their
hands
on
flew
the
harpies
screeching
and
gnashing
their
teeth
in
anger
and
dismay
for
now
they
felt
that
they
might
be
driven
from
salmydessus
where
they
had
had
such
royal
feasts
they
rose
high
in
the
air
and
flew
out
toward
the
sea
but
high
as
the
harpies
rose
the
sons
of
the
north
wind
rose
higher
the
harpies
cried
pitiful
cries
as
they
flew
on
but
zetes
and
calais
felt
no
pity
for
them
for
they
knew
that
these
dread
snatchers
with
the
stains
of
blood
upon
their
breasts
and
wings
had
shown
pity

raised
his

and
stretched
out

to
them

told

told
the

they

a

he
led
the

through

and
down
into
his

there
he
bestowed
upon
the
banishers
of
the
harpies
crowns
and
arm
rings
of
gold
and
richly
colored
garments
and
brazen
chests
in
which
to
store
the
treasure
that
he
gave
and
to
jason
he
gave
an
and
sword
and
on
each
of

voyagers
he
bestowed
a
rich
gift
not
forgetting
the
heroes
who
had
remained
on
the
heracles
and
tiphys
they
went
back
to
the
great
hall
and
a
feast
was
spread
for
the
king
and
for
the
argonauts
they
ate
from
rich
dishes
and
they
drank
from
flowing
wine
cups
phineus
ate
and
drank
as
the
heroes
did
and
no
dread
shapes
came
before
him
to
snatch
from
him
nor
to
buffet
him
but
as
jason
looked
upon
the
man
who
had
striven
to
equal
the
gods
in
wisdom
and
noted
his
blinded
eyes
and
shrunken
face
he
resolved
never
to
harbor
in
his
heart
such
presumption
as
phineus
had
harbored
when
the
feast
was
finished
the
king
spoke
to
jason
telling
him
how
the
might
be
guided
through
the
symplegades
the
dread
passage
into
the
sea
of
pontus
he
told
them
to
bring
their
ship
near
to
the
clashing
rocks
and
one
who
had
the
keenest
sight
amongst
them
was
to
stand
at
the
prow
of
the
ship
holding
a
pigeon
in
his
hands
as
the
rocks
came
together
he
was
to
loose
the
pigeon
if
it
found
a
space
to
fly
through
they
would
know
that
the
could
make
the
passage
and
they
were
to
steer
straight
toward
where
the
pigeon
had
flown
but
if
it
fluttered
down
to
the
sea
or
flew
back
to
them
or
became
lost
in
the
clouds
of
spray
they
were
to
know
that
the
might
not
make
that
passage
then
the
heroes
would
have
to
take
their
ship
overland
to
where
they
might
reach
the
sea
of
pontus
that
day
they
bade
farewell
to
phineus
and
with
the
treasures
he
had
bestowed
upon
them
they
went
down
to
the
to
heracles
and
tiphys
they
gave
the
presents
that
the
king
had
sent
them
in
the
morning
they
drew
the
out
of
the
harbor
of
salmydessus
and
set
sail
again
but
not
until
long
afterward
did
they
come
to
the
symplegades
the
passage
that
was
to
be
their
great
trial
for
they
landed
first
in
a
country
that
was
full
of
woods
where
they
were
welcomed
by
a
king
who
had
heard
of
the
voyagers
and
of
their
quest
there
they
stayed
and
hunted
for
many
days
in
the
woods
and
there
a
great
loss
befell
the
argonauts
for
tiphys
as
he
went
through
the
woods
was
bitten
by
a
snake
and
died
he
who
had
braved
so
many
seas
and
so
many
storms
lost
his
life
away
from
the
ship
the
argonauts
made
a
tomb
for
him
on
the
shore
of
that
great
pile
of
stones
in
which
they
fixed
upright
his
steering
oar
then
they
set
sail
again
and
nauplius
was
made
the
steersman
of
the
ship
the
course
was
not
so
clear
to
nauplius
as
it
had
been
to
tiphys
the
steersman
did
not
find
his
bearings
and
for
many
days
and
nights
the
was
driven
on
a
backward
course
they
came
to
an
island
that
they
knew
to
be
that
island
of
lemnos
that
they
had
passed
on
the
first
days
of
the
voyage
and
they
resolved
to
rest
there
for
a
while
and
then
to
press
on
for
the
passage
into
the
sea
of
pontus
they
brought
the
near
the
shore
they
blew
trumpets
and
set
the
loudest
voiced
of
the
heroes
to
call
out
to
those
upon
the
island
but
no
answer
came
to
them
and
all
day
the
lay
close
to
the
island
there
were
hidden
people
watching
them
people
with
bows
in
their
hands
and
arrows
laid
along
the
bowstrings
and
the
people
who
thus
threatened
the
unknowing
argonauts
were
women
and
young
girls
there
were
no
men
upon
the
island
of
lemnos
years
before
a
curse
had
fallen
upon
the
people
of
that
island
putting
strife
between
the
men
and
the
women
and
the
women
had
mastered
the
men
and
had
driven
them
away
from
lemnos
since
then
some
of
the
women
had
grown
old
and
the
girls
who
were
children
when
their
fathers
and
brothers
had
been
banished
were
now
of
an
age
with
atalanta
the
maiden
who
went
with
the
argonauts
they
chased
the
wild
beasts
of
the
island
and
they
tilled
the
fields
and
they
kept
in
good
repair
the
houses
that
were
built
before
the
banishing
of
the
men
the
older
women
served
those
who
were
younger
and
they
had
a
queen
a
girl
whose
name
was
hypsipyle
the
women
who
watched
with
bows
in
their
hands
would
have
shot
their
arrows
at
the
argonauts
if
hypsipyle
s
nurse
polyxo
had
not
stayed
them
she
forbade
them
to
shoot
at
the
strangers
until
she
had
brought
to
them
the
queen
s
commands
she
hastened
to
the
palace
and
she
found
the
young
queen
weaving
at
a
loom
she
told
her
about
the
ship
and
the
strangers
on
board
the
ship
and
she
asked
the
queen
what
word
she
should
bring
to
the
guardian
maidens
before
you
give
a
command
hypsipyle
said
polyxo
the
nurse
consider
these
words
of
mine
we
the
elder
women
are
becoming
ancient
now
in
a
few
years
we
will
not
be
able
to
serve
you
the
younger
women
and
in
a
few
years
more
we
will
have
gone
into
the
grave
and
our
places
will
know
us
no
more
and
you
the
younger
women
will
be
becoming
strengthless
and
no
more
will
be
you
able
to
hunt
in
the
woods
nor
to
till
the
fields
and
a
hard
old
age
will
be
before
you
the
ship
that
is
beside
our
shore
may
have
come
at
a
good
time
those
on
board
are
goodly
heroes
let
them
land
in
lemnos
and
stay
if
they
will
let
them
wed
with
the
younger
women
so
that
there
may
be
husbands
and
wives
helpers
and
helpmeets
again
in
hypsipyle
the
queen
let
the
shuttle
fall
from
her
hands
and
stayed
for
a
while
looking
full
into
polyxo
s
face
had
her
nurse
heard
her
say
something
like
this
out
of
her
dreams
she
wondered
she
bade
the
nurse
tell
the
guardian
maidens
to
let
the
heroes
land
in
safety
and
that
she
herself
would
put
the
crown
of
king
thoas
her
father
upon
her
head
and
go
down
to
the
shore
to
welcome
them
and
now
the
argonauts
saw
people
along
the
shore
and
they
caught
sight
of
women
s
dresses
the
loudest
voiced
amongst
them
shouted
again
and
they
heard
an
answer
given
in
a
woman
s
voice
they
drew
up
the
upon
the
shore
and
they
set
foot
upon
the
land
of
lemnos
jason
stepped
forth
at
the
head
of
his
comrades
and
he
was
met
by
hypsipyle
her
father
s
crown
upon
her
head
at
the
head
of
her
maidens
they
greeted
each
other
and
hypsipyle
bade
the
heroes
come
with
them
to
their
town
that
was
called
myrine
and
to
the
palace
that
was
there
wonderingly
the
argonauts
went
looking
on
women
s
forms
and
faces
and
seeing
no
men
they
came
to
the
palace
and
went
within
hypsipyle
mounted
the
stone
throne
that
was
king
thoas
s
and
the
four
maidens
who
were
her
guards
stood
each
side
of
her
she
spoke
to
the
heroes
in
greeting
and
bade
them
stay
in
peace
for
as
long
as
they
would
she
told
them
of
the
curse
that
had
fallen
upon
the
people
of
lemnos
and
of
how
the
menfolk
had
been
banished
jason
then
told
the
queen
what
voyage
he
and
his
companions
were
upon
and
what
quest
they
were
making
then
in
friendship
the
argonauts
and
the
women
of
lemnos
stayed
the
argonauts
except
heracles
and
he
grieving
still
for
hylas
stayed
aboard
the
ix
the
lemnian
maidens
decorative
first
letter
now
the
argonauts
were
no
longer
on
a
ship
that
was
being
dashed
on
by
the
sea
and
beaten
upon
by
the
winds
they
had
houses
to
live
in
they
had
things
to
eat
and
when
they
went
through
the
island
each
man
might
have
with
him
one
of
the
maidens
of
lemnos
it
was
a
change
that
was
welcome
to
the
wearied
voyagers
they
helped
the
women
in
the
work
of
the
fields
they
hunted
the
beasts
with
them
and
over
and
over
again
they
were
surprised
at
how
skillfully
the
women
had
ordered
all
affairs
everything
in
lemnos
was
strange
to
the
argonauts
and
they
stayed
day
after
day
thinking
each
day
a
fresh
adventure
sometimes
they
would
leave
the
fields
and
the
chase
and
this
hero
or
that
hero
with
her
who
was
his
friend
amongst
the
lemnian
maidens
would
go
far
into
that
strange
land
and
look
upon
lakes
that
were
all
covered
with
golden
and
silver
water
lilies
or
would
gather
the
blue
flowers
from
creepers
that
grew
around
dark
trees
or
would
hide
themselves
so
that
they
might
listen
to
the
birds
that
sang
in
the
thickets
perhaps
on
their
way
homeward
they
would
see
the
in
the
harbor
and
they
would
think
of
heracles
who
was
aboard
and
they
would
call
to
him
but
the
ship
and
the
voyage
they
had
been
on
now
seemed
far
away
to
them
and
the
quest
of
the
golden
fleece
seemed
to
them
a
story
they
had
heard
and
that
they
had
thought
of
but
that
they
could
never
think
on
again
with
all
that
fervor
when
jason
looked
on
hypsipyle
he
saw
one
who
seemed
to
him
to
be
only
childlike
in
size
greatly
was
he
amazed
at
the
words
that
poured
forth
from
her
as
she
stood
at
the
stone
throne
of
king
was
amazed
as
one
is
amazed
at
the
rush
of
rich
notes
that
comes
from
the
throat
of
a
little
bird
all
that
she
said
was
made
lightninglike
by
her
eyes
that
were
not
clear
and
quiet
like
the
eyes
of
the
maidens
he
had
seen
in
iolcus
but
that
were
dark
and
burning
her
mouth
was
heavy
and
this
heavy
mouth
gave
a
shadow
to
her
face
that
but
for
it
was
all
bright
and
lovely
hypsipyle
spoke
two
the
language
of
the
mothers
of
the
women
of
lemnos
which
was
rough
and
harsh
a
speech
to
be
flung
out
to
slaves
and
the
other
the
language
of
greece
which
their
fathers
had
spoken
and
which
hypsipyle
spoke
in
a
way
that
made
it
sound
like
strange
music
she
spoke
and
walked
and
did
all
things
in
a
queenlike
way
and
jason
could
see
that
for
all
her
youth
and
childlike
size
hypsipyle
was
one
who
was
a
ruler
from
the
moment
she
took
his
hand
it
seemed
that
she
could
not
bear
to
be
away
from
him
where
he
walked
she
walked
too
where
he
sat
she
sat
before
him
looking
at
him
with
her
great
eyes
while
she
laughed
or
sang
like
the
perfume
of
strange
flowers
like
the
savor
of
strange
fruit
was
hypsipyle
to
jason
hours
and
hours
he
would
spend
sitting
beside
her
or
watching
her
while
she
arrayed
herself
in
white
or
in
brightly
colored
garments
not
to
the
chase
and
not
into
the
fields
did
jason
go
nor
did
he
ever
go
with
the
others
into
the
lemnian
land
all
day
he
sat
in
the
palace
with
her
watching
her
or
listening
to
her
singing
or
to
the
long
fierce
speeches
that
she
used
to
make
to
her
nurse
or
to
the
four
maidens
who
attended
her
in
the
evening
they
would
gather
in
the
hall
of
the
palace
the
argonauts
and
the
lemnian
maidens
who
were
their
comrades
there
were
dances
and
always
jason
and
hypsipyle
danced
together
all
the
lemnian
maidens
sang
beautifully
but
none
of
them
had
any
stories
to
tell
and
when
the
argonauts
would
have
stories
told
the
lemnian
maidens
would
forbid
any
tale
that
was
about
a
god
or
a
hero
only
stories
that
were
about
the
goddesses
or
about
some
maiden
would
they
let
be
told
orpheus
who
knew
the
histories
of
the
gods
would
have
told
them
many
stories
but
the
only
story
of
his
that
they
would
come
from
the
dance
to
listen
to
was
a
story
of
the
goddesses
of
demeter
and
her
daughter
persephone
illustration
demeter
and
persephone
i
once
when
demeter
was
going
through
the
world
giving
men
grain
to
be
sown
in
their
fields
she
heard
a
cry
that
came
to
her
from
across
high
mountains
and
that
mounted
up
to
her
from
the
sea
demeter
s
heart
shook
when
she
heard
that
cry
for
she
knew
that
it
came
to
her
from
her
daughter
from
her
only
child

she
stayed
not
to
bless
the
fields

which
the
grain
was
being
sown

she
hurried

away

sicily

to
the
fields

where
she
had
left

enna
she
searched
and
all

but
she
found
no
trace
of

nor
of
the
maidens
whom
persephone
had
been
playing
with
from
all
whom
she
met
she
begged
for
tidings
but
although
some
had
seen
maidens
gathering
flowers
and
playing
together
no
one
could
tell
demeter
why
her
child
had
cried
out
nor
where
she
had
since
gone
to
there
were
some
who
could
have
told
her
one
was
cyane
a
water
nymph
but
cyane
before
demeter
came
to
her
had
been
changed
into
a
spring
of
water
and
now
not
being
able
to
speak
and
tell
demeter
where
her
child
had
gone
to
and
who
had
carried
her
away
she
showed
in
the
water
the
girdle
of
persephone
that
she
had
caught
in
her
hands
and
demeter
finding
the
girdle
of
her
child
in
the
spring
knew
that
she
had
been
carried
off
by
violence
she
lighted
a
torch
at
ætna
s
burning
mountain
and
for
nine
days
and
nine
nights
she
went
searching
for
her
through
the
darkened
places
of
the
earth
then
upon
a
high
and
a
dark
hill
the
goddess
demeter
came
face
to
face
with
hecate
the
moon
hecate
too
had
heard
the
cry
of
persephone
she
had
sorrow
for
demeter
s
sorrow
she
spoke
to
her
as
the
two
stood
upon
that
dark
high
hill
and
told
her
that
she
should
go
to
helios
for
bright
helios
the
watcher
for
the
gods
and
beg
helios
to
tell
her
who
it
was
who
had
carried
off
by
violence
her
child
persephone
demeter
came
to
helios
he
was
standing
before
his
shining
steeds
before
the
impatient
steeds
that
draw
the
sun
through
the
course
of
the
heavens
demeter
stood
in
the
way
of
those
impatient
steeds
she
begged
of
helios
who
sees
all
things
upon
the
earth
to
tell
her
who
it
was
had
carried
off
by
violence
persephone
her
child
and
helios
who
may
make
no
concealment
said
queenly
demeter
know
that
the
king
of
the
underworld
dark
aidoneus
has
carried
off
persephone
to
make
her
his
queen
in
the
realm
that
i
never
shine
he
spoke
and
as
he
did
his
horses
shook
their
manes
and
breathed
out
fire
impatient
to
be
gone
helios
sprang
into
his
chariot
and
went
flashing
away
demeter
knowing
that
one
of
the
gods
had
carried
off
persephone
against
her
will
and
knowing
that
what
was
done
had
been
done
by
the
will
of
zeus
would
go
no
more
into
the
assemblies
of
the
gods
she
quenched
the
torch
that
she
had
held
in
her
hands
for
nine
days
and
nine
nights
she
put
off
her
robe
of
goddess
and
she
went
wandering
over
the
earth
uncomforted
for
the
loss
of
her
child
and
no
longer
did
she
appear
as
a
gracious
goddess
to
men
no
longer
did
she
give
them
grain
no
longer
did
she
bless
their
fields
none
of
the
things
that
it
had
pleased
her
once
to
do
would
demeter
do
any
longer
ii
persephone
had
been
playing
with
the
nymphs
who
are
the
daughters
of
ianthe
melita
ianeira
the
lovely
fields
of
enna
they
went
to
gather
and
crocuses
lilies
narcissus
hyacinths
and
grow
in
those
fields
as
they
went
gathering
flowers
in
their
baskets
they
had
sight
of
pergus
the
pool
that
the
white
swans
come
to
sing
in
beside
a
deep
chasm
that
had
been
made
in
the
earth
a
wonder
flower
was
color
it
was
like
the
crocus
but
it
sent
forth
a
perfume
that
was
like
the
perfume
of
a
hundred
flowers
and
persephone
thought
as
she
went
toward
it
that
having
gathered
that
flower
she
would
have
something
much
more
wonderful
than
her
companions
had
she
did
not
know
that
aidoneus
the
lord
of
the
underworld
had
caused
that
flower
to
grow
there
so
that
she
might
be
drawn
by
it
to
the
chasm
that
he
had
made
as
persephone
stooped
to
pluck
the
wonder
flower
aidoneus
in
his
chariot
of
iron
dashed
up
through
the
chasm
and
grasping
the
maiden
by
the
waist
set
her
beside
him
only
cyane
the
nymph
tried
to
save
persephone
and
it
was
then
that
she
caught
the
girdle
in
her
hands
the
maiden
cried
out
first
because
her
flowers
had
been
spilled
and
then
because
she
was
being
reft
away
she
cried
out
to
her
mother
and
her
cry
went
over
high
mountains
and
sounded
up
from
the
sea
the
daughters
of
ocean
affrighted
fled
and
sank
down
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
in
his
great
chariot
of
iron
that
was
drawn
by
black
steeds
aidoneus
rushed
down
through
the
chasm
he
had
made
into
the
underworld
he
went
and
he
dashed
across
the
river
styx
and
he
brought
his
chariot
up
beside
his
throne
and
on
his
dark
throne
he
seated
persephone
the
fainting
daughter
of
demeter
iii
no
more
did
the
goddess
demeter
give
grain
to
men
no
more
did
she
bless
their
fields
weeds
grew
where
grain
had
been
growing
and
men
feared
that
in
a
while
they
would
famish
for
lack
of
bread
she
wandered
through
the
world
her
thought
all
upon
her
child
persephone
who
had
been
taken
from
her
once
she
sat
by
a
well
by
a
wayside
thinking
upon
the
child
that
she
might
not
come
to
and
who
might
not
come
to
her
she
saw
four
maidens
come
near
their
grace
and
their
youth
reminded
her
of
her
child
they
stepped
lightly
along
carrying
bronze
pitchers
in
their
hands
for
they
were
coming
to
the
well
of
the
maiden
beside
which
demeter
sat
illustration
persephone
and
aidoneus
the
maidens
thought
when
they
looked
upon
her
that
the
goddess
was
some
ancient
woman
who
had
a
sorrow
in
her
heart
seeing
that
she
was
so
noble
and
so
sorrowful
looking
the
maidens
as
they
drew
the
clear
water
into
their
pitchers
spoke
kindly
to
her
why
do
you
stay
away
from
the
town
old
mother
one
of
the
maidens
said
why
do
you
not
come
to
the
houses
we
think
that
you
look
as
if
you
were
shelterless
and
alone
and
we
should
like
to
tell
you
that
there
are
many
houses
in
the
town
where
you
would
be
demeter
s
heart
went
out
to
the
maidens
because
they
looked
so
young
and
fair
and
simple
and
spoke
out
of
such
kind
hearts
she
said
to
them
where
can
i
go
dear
children
my
people
are
far
away
and
there
are
none
in
all
the
world
who
would
care
to
be
near
said
one
of
the
maidens
there
are
princes
in
the
land
who
would
welcome
you
in
their
houses
if
you
would
consent
to
nurse
one
of
their
young
children
but
why
do
i
speak
of
other
princes
beside
celeus
our
father
in
his
house
you
would
indeed
have
a
welcome
but
lately
a
baby
has
been
born
to
our
mother
metaneira
and
she
would
greatly
rejoice
to
have
one
as
wise
as
you
mind
little
all
the
time
that
she
watched
them
and
listened
to
their
voices
demeter
felt
that
the
grace
and
youth
of
the
maidens
made
them
like
persephone
she
thought
that
it
would
ease
her
heart
to
be
in
the
house
where
these
maidens
were
and
she
was
not
loath
to
have
them
go
and
ask
of
their
mother
to
have
her
come
to
nurse
the
infant
child
swiftly
they
ran
back
to
their
home
their
hair
streaming
behind
them
like
crocus
flowers
kind
and
lovely
girls
whose
names
are
well
and
cleisidice
demo
and
callithoë
they
went
to
their
mother
and
they
told
her
of
the
whose
name
was
doso
she
would
make
a
wise
and
a
kind
nurse
for
little
demophoön
they
said
their
mother
metaneira
rose
up
from
the
couch
she
was
sitting
on
to
welcome
the
stranger
but
when
she
saw
her
at
the
doorway
awe
came
over
her
so
majestic
she
seemed
metaneira
would
have
her
seat
herself
on
the
couch
but
the
goddess
took
the
lowliest
stool
saying
in
greeting
may
the
gods
give
you
all
good
sorrow
has
set
you
wandering
from
your
good
home
said
metaneira
to
the
goddess
but
now
that
you
have
come
to
this
place
you
shall
have
all
that
this
house
can
bestow
if
you
will
rear
up
to
youth
the
infant
demophoön
child
of
many
hopes
and
the
child
was
put
into
the
arms
of
demeter
she
clasped
him
to
her
breast
and
little
demophoön
looked
up
into
her
face
and
smiled
then
demeter
s
heart
went
out
to
the
child
and
to
all
who
were
in
the
household
he
grew
in
strength
and
beauty
in
her
charge
and
little
demophoön
was
not
nourished
as
other
children
are
nourished
but
even
as
the
gods
in
their
childhood
were
nourished
demeter
fed
him
on
ambrosia
breathing
on
him
with
her
divine
breath
the
while
and
at
night
she
laid
him
on
the
hearth
amongst
the
embers
with
the
fire
all
around
him
this
she
did
that
she
might
make
him
immortal
and
like
to
the
gods
illustration
but
one
night
metaneira
looked
out
from
the
chamber
where
she
lay
and
she
saw
the
nurse
take
little
demophoön
and
lay
him
in
a
place
on
the
hearth
with
the
burning
brands
all
around
him
then
metaneira
started
up
and
she
sprang
to
the
hearth
and
she
snatched
the
child
from
beside
the
burning
brands
demophoõn
my
son
she
cried
what
would
this
do
to
you
bringing
bitter
grief
to
me
that
ever
i
let
her
take
you
in
her
arms
then
said
demeter
foolish
indeed
are
you
mortals
and
not
able
to
foresee
what
is
to
come
to
you
of
good
or
of
evil
foolish
indeed
are
you
metaneira
for
in
your
heedlessness
you
have
cut
off
this
child
from
an
immortality
like
to
the
immortality
of
the
gods
themselves
for
he
had
lain
in
my
bosom
and
had
become
dear
to
me
and
i
would
have
bestowed
upon
him
the
greatest
gift
that
the
divine
ones
can
bestow
for
i
would
have
made
him
deathless
and
unaging
all
this
now
has
gone
by
honor
he
shall
have
indeed
but
demophoõn
will
know
age
and
the
seeming
old
age
that
was
upon
her
had
fallen
from
demeter
beauty
and
stature
were
hers
and
from
her
robe
there
came
a
heavenly
fragrance
there
came
such
light
from
her
body
that
the
chamber
shone
metaneira
remained
trembling
and
speechless
unmindful
even
to
take
up
the
child
that
had
been
laid
upon
the
ground
it
was
then
that
his
sisters
heard
demophoön
wail
one
ran
from
her
chamber
and
took
the
child
in
her
arms
another
kindled
again
the
fire
upon
the
hearth
and
the
others
made
ready
to
bathe
and
care
for
the
infant
all
night
they
cared
for
him
holding
him
in
their
arms
and
at
their
breasts
but
the
child
would
not
be
comforted
because
the
nurses
who
handled
him
now
were
less
skillful
than
was
the
and
as
for
demeter
she
left
the
house
of
celeus
and
went
upon
her
way
lonely
in
her
heart
and
unappeased
and
in
the
world
that
she
wandered
through
the
plow
went
in
vain
through
the
ground
the
furrow
was
sown
without
any
avail
and
the
race
of
men
saw
themselves
near
perishing
for
lack
of
bread
but
again
demeter
came
near
the
well
of
the
maiden
she
thought
of
the
daughters
of
celeus
as
they
came
toward
the
well
that
day
the
bronze
pitchers
in
their
hands
and
with
kind
looks
for
the
thought
of
them
as
she
sat
by
the
well
again
and
then
she
thought
of
little
demophoön
the
child
she
had
held
at
her
breast
no
stir
of
living
was
in
the
land
near
their
home
and
only
weeds
grew
in
their
fields
as
she
sat
there
and
looked
around
her
there
came
into
demeter
s
heart
a
pity
for
the
people
in
whose
house
she
had
dwelt
she
rose
up
and
she
went
to
the
house
of
celeus
she
found
him
beside
his
house
measuring
out
a
little
grain
the
goddess
went
to
him
and
she
told
him
that
because
of
the
love
she
bore
his
household
she
would
bless
his
fields
so
that
the
seed
he
had
sown
in
them
would
come
to
growth
celeus
rejoiced
and
he
called
all
the
people
together
and
they
raised
a
temple
to
demeter
she
went
through
the
fields
and
blessed
them
and
the
seed
that
they
had
sown
began
to
grow
and
the
goddess
for
a
while
dwelt
amongst
that
people
in
her
temple
at
eleusis
illustration
iv
but
still
she
kept
away
from
the
assemblies
of
the
gods
zeus
sent
a
messenger
to
her
iris
with
the
golden
wings
bidding
her
to
olympus
demeter
would
not
join
the
olympians
then
one
after
the
other
the
gods
and
goddesses
of
olympus
came
to
her
none
were
able
to
make
her
cease
from
grieving
for
persephone
or
to
go
again
into
the
company
of
the
immortal
gods
and
so
it
came
about
that
zeus
was
compelled
to
send
a
messenger
down
to
the
underworld
to
bring
persephone
back
to
the
mother
who
grieved
so
much
for
the
loss
of
her
hermes
was
the
messenger
whom
zeus
sent
through
the
darkened
places
of
the
earth
hermes
went
and
he
came
to
that
dark
throne
where
the
lord
aidoneus
sat
with
persephone
beside
him
then
hermes
spoke
to
the
lord
of
the
underworld
saying
that
zeus
commanded
that
persephone
should
come
forth
from
the
underworld
that
her
mother
might
look
upon
her
then
persephone
hearing
the
words
of
zeus
that
might
not
be
gainsaid
uttered
the
only
cry
that
had
left
her
lips
since
she
had
sent
out
that
cry
that
had
reached
her
mother
s
heart
and
aidoneus
hearing
the
command
of
zeus
that
might
not
be
denied
bowed
his
dark
majestic
head
she
might
go
to
the
upperworld
and
rest
herself
in
the
arms
of
her
mother
he
said
and
then
he
cried
out
ah
persephone
strive
to
feel
kindliness
in
your
heart
toward
me
who
carried
you
off
by
violence
and
against
your
will
i
can
give
to
you
one
of
the
great
kingdoms
that
the
olympians
rule
over
and
i
who
am
brother
to
zeus
am
no
unfitting
husband
for
you
demeter
s
so
aidoneus
the
dark
lord
of
the
underworld
said
and
he
made
ready
the
iron
chariot
with
its
deathless
horses
that
persephone
might
go
up
from
his
kingdom
beside
the
single
tree
in
his
domain
aidoneus
stayed
the
chariot
a
single
fruit
grew
on
that
tree
a
bright
pomegranate
fruit
persephone
stood
up
in
the
chariot
and
plucked
the
fruit
from
the
tree
then
did
aidoneus
prevail
upon
her
to
divide
the
fruit
and
having
divided
it
persephone
ate
seven
of
the
pomegranate
seeds
it
was
hermes
who
took
the
whip
and
the
reins
of
the
chariot
he
drove
on
and
neither
the
sea
nor
the
nor
the
glens
nor
the
mountain
peaks
stayed
the
deathless
horses
of
aidoneus
and
soon
the
chariot
was
brought
near
to
where
demeter
awaited
the
coming
of
her
daughter
illustration
and
when
from
a
hilltop
demeter
saw
the
chariot
approaching
she
flew
like
a
wild
bird
to
clasp
her
child
persephone
when
she
saw
her
mother
s
dear
eyes
sprang
out
of
the
chariot
and
fell
upon
her
neck
and
embraced
her
long
and
long
demeter
held
her
dear
child
in
her
arms
gazing
gazing
upon
her
suddenly
her
mind
misgave
her
with
a
great
fear
at
her
heart
she
cried
out
dearest
has
any
food
passed
your
lips
in
all
the
time
you
have
been
in
the
underworld
she
had
not
tasted
food
in
all
the
time
she
was
there
persephone
said
and
then
suddenly
she
remembered
the
pomegranate
that
aidoneus
had
asked
her
to
divide
when
she
told
that
she
had
eaten
seven
seeds
from
it
demeter
wept
and
her
tears
fell
upon
persephone
s
face
ah
my
dearest
she
cried
if
you
had
not
eaten
the
pomegranate
seeds
you
could
have
stayed
with
me
and
always
we
should
have
been
together
but
now
that
you
have
eaten
food
in
it
the
underworld
has
a
claim
upon
you
you
may
not
stay
always
with
me
here
again
you
will
have
to
go
back
and
dwell
in
the
dark
places
under
the
earth
and
sit
upon
aidoneus
s
throne
but
not
always
you
will
be
there
when
the
flowers
bloom
upon
the
earth
you
shall
come
up
from
the
realm
of
darkness
and
in
great
joy
we
shall
go
through
the
world
together
demeter
and
and
so
it
has
been
since
persephone
came
back
to
her
mother
after
having
eaten
of
the
pomegranate
seeds
for
two
seasons
of
the
year
she
stays
with
demeter
and
for
one
season
she
stays
in
the
underworld
with
her
dark
lord
while
she
is
with
her
mother
there
is
springtime
upon
the
earth
demeter
blesses
the
furrows
her
heart
being
glad
because
her
daughter
is
with
her
once
more
the
furrows
become
heavy
with
grain
and
soon
the
whole
wide
earth
has
grain
and
fruit
leaves
and
flowers
when
the
furrows
are
reaped
when
the
grain
has
been
gathered
when
the
dark
season
comes
persephone
goes
from
her
mother
and
going
down
into
the
dark
places
she
sits
beside
her
mighty
lord
aidoneus
and
upon
his
throne
not
sorrowful
is
she
there
she
sits
with
head
unbowed
for
she
knows
herself
to
be
a
mighty
queen
she
has
joy
too
knowing
of
the
seasons
when
she
may
walk
with
demeter
her
mother
on
the
wide
places
of
the
earth
through
fields
of
flowers
and
fruit
and
ripening
grain
such
was
the
story
that
orpheus
who
knew
the
histories
of
the
gods
a
day
came
when
the
heroes
on
their
way
back
from
a
journey
they
had
made
with
the
lemnian
maidens
called
out
to
heracles
upon
the
then
heracles
standing
on
the
prow
of
the
ship
shouted
angrily
to
them
terrible
did
he
seem
to
the
lemnian
maidens
and
they
ran
off
drawing
the
heroes
with
them
heracles
shouted
to
his
comrades
again
saying
that
if
they
did
not
come
aboard
the
and
make
ready
for
the
voyage
to
colchis
he
would
go
ashore
and
carry
them
to
the
ship
and
force
them
again
to
take
the
oars
in
their
hands
not
all
of
what
heracles
said
did
the
argonauts
hear
that
evening
the
men
were
silent
in
hypsipyle
s
hall
and
it
was
atalanta
the
maiden
who
told
the
evening
s
story
atalanta
s
race
there
are
two
atalantas
she
said
she
herself
the
huntress
and
another
who
is
noted
for
her
speed
of
foot
and
her
delight
in
the
daughter
of
schœneus
king
of
bœotia
atalanta
of
the
swift
foot
so
proud
was
she
of
her
swiftness
that
she
made
a
vow
to
the
gods
that
none
would
be
her
husband
except
the
youth
who
won
past
her
in
the
race
youth
after
youth
came
and
raced
against
her
but
atalanta
who
grew
fleeter
and
fleeter
of
foot
left
each
one
of
them
far
behind
her
the
youths
who
came
to
the
race
were
so
many
and
the
clamor
they
made
after
defeat
was
so
great
that
her
father
made
a
law
that
as
he
thought
would
lessen
their
number
the
law
that
he
made
was
that
the
youth
who
came
to
race
against
atalanta
and
who
lost
the
race
should
lose
his
life
into
the
bargain
after
that
the
youths
who
had
care
for
their
lives
stayed
away
from
bœotia
once
there
came
a
youth
from
a
far
part
of
greece
into
the
country
that
atalanta
s
father
ruled
over
hippomenes
was
his
name
he
did
not
know
of
the
race
but
having
come
into
the
city
and
seeing
the
crowd
of
people
he
went
with
them
to
the
course
he
looked
upon
the
youths
who
were
girded
for
the
race
and
he
heard
the
folk
say
amongst
themselves
poor
youths
as
mighty
and
as
as
they
look
by
sunset
the
life
will
be
out
of
each
of
them
for
atalanta
will
run
past
them
as
she
ran
past
the
then
hippomenes
spoke
to
the
folk
in
wonder
and
they
told
him
of
atalanta
s
race
and
of
what
would
befall
the
youths
who
were
defeated
in
it
unlucky
youths
cried
hippomenes
how
foolish
they
are
to
try
to
win
a
bride
at
the
price
of
their
then
with
pity
in
his
heart
he
watched
the
youths
prepare
for
the
race
atalanta
had
not
yet
taken
her
place
and
he
was
fearful
of
looking
upon
her
she
is
a
witch
he
said
to
himself
she
must
be
a
witch
to
draw
so
many
youths
to
their
deaths
and
she
no
doubt
will
show
in
her
face
and
figure
the
witch
s
but
even
as
he
said
this
hippomenes
saw
atalanta
she
stood
with
the
youths
before
they
crouched
for
the
first
dart
in
the
race
he
saw
that
she
was
a
girl
of
a
light
and
a
lovely
form
then
they
crouched
for
the
race
then
the
trumpets
rang
out
and
the
youths
and
the
maiden
darted
like
swallows
over
the
sand
of
the
course
on
came
atalanta
far
far
ahead
of
the
youths
who
had
started
with
her
over
her
bare
shoulders
her
hair
streamed
blown
backward
by
the
wind
that
met
her
flight
her
fair
neck
shone
and
her
little
feet
were
like
flying
doves
it
seemed
to
hippomenes
as
he
watched
her
that
there
was
fire
in
her
lovely
body
on
and
on
she
went
as
swift
as
the
arrow
that
the
scythian
shoots
from
his
bow
and
as
he
watched
the
race
he
was
not
sorry
that
the
youths
were
being
left
behind
rather
would
he
have
been
enraged
if
one
came
near
overtaking
her
for
now
his
heart
was
set
upon
winning
her
for
his
bride
and
he
cursed
himself
for
not
having
entered
the
race
she
passed
the
last
goal
mark
and
she
was
given
the
victor
s
wreath
of
flowers
hippomenes
stood
and
watched
her
and
he
did
not
see
the
youths
who
had
started
with
had
thrown
themselves
on
the
ground
in
their
despair
then
wild
as
though
he
were
one
of
the
doomed
youths
hippomenes
made
his
way
through
the
throng
and
came
before
the
king
of
bœtia
the
king
s
brows
were
knit
for
even
then
he
was
pronouncing
doom
upon
the
youths
who
had
been
left
behind
in
the
race
he
looked
upon
hippomenes
another
youth
who
would
make
the
trial
and
the
frown
became
heavier
upon
his
face
but
hippomenes
saw
only
atalanta
she
came
beside
her
father
the
wreath
was
upon
her
head
of
gold
and
her
eyes
were
wide
and
tender
she
turned
her
face
to
him
and
then
she
knew
by
the
wildness
that
was
in
his
look
that
he
had
come
to
enter
the
race
with
her
then
the
flush
that
was
on
her
face
died
away
and
she
shook
her
head
as
if
she
were
imploring
him
to
go
from
that
place
the
king
bent
his
brows
upon
him
and
said
speak
o
youth
speak
and
tell
us
what
brings
you
then
cried
hippomenes
as
if
his
whole
life
were
bursting
out
with
his
words
why
does
this
maiden
your
daughter
seek
an
easy
renown
by
conquering
weakly
youths
in
the
race
she
has
not
striven
yet
here
stand
i
one
of
the
blood
of
poseidon
the
god
of
the
sea
should
i
be
defeated
by
her
in
the
race
then
indeed
might
atalanta
have
something
to
boast
atalanta
stepped
forward
and
said
do
not
speak
of
it
youth
indeed
i
think
that
it
is
some
god
envious
of
your
beauty
and
your
strength
who
sent
you
here
to
strive
with
me
and
to
meet
your
doom
ah
think
of
the
youths
who
have
striven
with
me
even
now
think
of
the
hard
doom
that
is
about
to
fall
upon
them
you
venture
your
life
in
the
race
but
indeed
i
am
not
worthy
of
the
price
go
hence
o
stranger
youth
go
hence
and
live
happily
for
indeed
i
think
that
there
is
some
maiden
who
loves
you
nay
maiden
said
hippomenes
i
will
enter
the
race
and
i
will
venture
my
life
on
the
chance
of
winning
you
for
my
bride
what
good
will
my
life
and
my
spirit
be
to
me
if
they
can
not
win
this
race
for
me
she
drew
away
from
him
then
and
looked
upon
him
no
more
but
bent
down
to
fasten
the
sandals
upon
her
feet
and
the
king
looked
upon
hippomenes
and
said
face
then
this
race
you
will
be
the
only
one
who
will
enter
it
but
bethink
thee
of
the
doom
that
awaits
thee
at
the
end
of
the
king
said
no
more
and
hippomenes
went
from
him
and
from
atalanta
and
he
came
again
to
the
place
where
the
race
had
been
run
he
looked
across
the
sandy
course
with
its
goal
marks
and
in
his
mind
he
saw
again
atalanta
s
swift
race
he
would
not
meet
doom
at
the
hands
of
the
king
s
soldiers
he
knew
for
his
spirit
would
leave
him
with
the
greatness
of
the
effort
he
would
make
to
reach
the
goal
before
her
and
he
thought
it
would
be
well
to
die
in
that
effort
and
on
that
sandy
place
that
was
so
far
from
his
own
land
even
as
he
looked
across
the
sandy
course
now
deserted
by
the
throng
he
saw
one
move
across
it
coming
toward
him
with
feet
that
did
not
seem
to
touch
the
ground
she
was
a
woman
of
wonderful
presence
as
hippomenes
looked
upon
her
he
knew
that
she
was
aphrodite
the
goddess
of
beauty
and
of
love
hippomenes
said
the
immortal
goddess
the
gods
are
mindful
of
you
who
are
sprung
from
one
of
the
gods
and
i
am
mindful
of
you
because
of
your
own
worth
i
have
come
to
help
you
in
your
race
with
atalanta
for
i
would
not
have
you
slain
nor
would
i
have
that
maiden
go
unwed
give
your
greatest
strength
and
your
greatest
swiftness
to
the
race
and
behold
here
are
wonders
that
will
prevent
the
atalanta
from
putting
all
her
spirit
into
the
and
then
the
immortal
goddess
held
out
to
hippomenes
a
branch
that
had
upon
it
three
apples
of
shining
gold
in
cyprus
said
the
goddess
where
i
have
come
from
there
is
a
tree
on
which
these
golden
apples
grow
only
i
may
pluck
them
i
have
brought
them
to
you
hippomenes
keep
them
in
your
girdle
and
in
the
race
you
will
find
out
what
to
do
with
them
i
so
aphrodite
said
and
then
she
vanished
leaving
a
fragrance
in
the
air
and
the
three
shining
apples
in
the
hands
of
hippomenes
long
he
looked
upon
their
brightness
they
were
beside
him
that
night
and
when
he
arose
in
the
dawn
he
put
them
in
his
girdle
then
before
the
throng
he
went
to
the
place
of
the
race
when
he
showed
himself
beside
atalanta
all
around
the
course
were
silent
for
they
all
admired
hippomenes
for
his
beauty
and
for
the
spirit
that
was
in
his
face
they
were
silent
out
of
compassion
for
they
knew
the
doom
that
befell
the
youths
who
raced
with
atalanta
and
now
schœneus
the
king
stood
up
and
he
spoke
to
the
throng
saying
hear
me
all
both
young
and
old
this
youth
hippomenes
seeks
to
win
the
race
from
my
daughter
winning
her
for
his
bride
now
if
he
be
victorious
and
escape
death
i
will
give
him
my
dear
child
atalanta
and
many
fleet
horses
besides
as
gifts
from
me
and
in
honor
he
shall
go
back
to
his
native
land
but
if
he
fail
in
the
race
then
he
will
have
to
share
the
doom
that
has
been
meted
out
to
the
other
youths
who
raced
with
atalanta
hoping
to
win
her
for
a
then
hippomenes
and
atalanta
crouched
for
the
start
the
trumpets
were
sounded
and
they
darted
off
side
by
side
with
atalanta
hippomenes
went
her
flying
hair
touched
his
breast
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
skimming
the
sandy
course
as
if
they
were
swallows
but
then
atalanta
began
to
draw
away
from
him
he
saw
her
ahead
of
him
and
then
he
began
to
hear
the
words
of
cheer
that
came
from
the
bend
to
the
race
hippomenes
go
on
go
on
use
your
strength
to
the
he
bent
himself
to
the
race
but
further
and
further
from
him
atalanta
drew
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
checked
her
swiftness
a
little
to
look
back
at
him
he
gained
on
her
a
little
and
then
his
hand
touched
the
apples
that
were
in
his
girdle
as
it
touched
them
it
came
into
his
mind
what
to
do
with
the
apples
he
was
not
far
from
her
now
but
already
her
swiftness
was
drawing
her
further
and
further
away
he
took
one
of
the
apples
into
his
hand
and
tossed
it
into
the
air
so
that
it
fell
on
the
track
before
her
atalanta
saw
the
shining
apple
she
checked
her
speed
and
stooped
in
the
race
to
pick
it
up
and
as
she
stooped
hippomenes
darted
past
her
and
went
flying
toward
the
goal
that
now
was
within
his
sight
but
soon
she
was
beside
him
again
he
looked
and
he
saw
that
the
goal
marks
were
far
far
ahead
of
him
atalanta
with
the
flying
hair
passed
him
and
drew
away
and
away
from
him
he
had
not
speed
to
gain
upon
her
now
he
thought
so
he
put
his
strength
into
his
hand
and
he
flung
the
second
of
the
shining
apples
the
apple
rolled
before
her
and
rolled
off
the
course
atalanta
turned
off
the
course
stooped
and
picked
up
the
apple
then
did
hippomenes
draw
all
his
spirit
into
his
breast
as
he
raced
on
he
was
now
nearer
to
the
goal
than
she
was
but
he
knew
that
she
was
behind
him
going
lightly
where
he
went
heavily
and
then
she
was
beside
him
and
then
she
went
past
him
she
paused
in
her
speed
for
a
moment
and
she
looked
back
on
him
as
he
raced
on
his
chest
seemed
weighted
down
and
his
throat
was
crackling
dry
the
goal
marks
were
far
away
still
but
atalanta
was
nearing
them
he
took
the
last
of
the
golden
apples
into
his
hand
perhaps
she
was
now
so
far
that
the
strength
of
his
throw
would
not
be
great
enough
to
bring
the
apple
before
her
but
with
all
the
strength
he
could
put
into
his
hand
he
flung
the
apple
it
struck
the
course
before
her
feet
and
then
went
bounding
wide
atalanta
swerved
in
her
race
and
followed
where
the
apple
went
hippomenes
marveled
that
he
had
been
able
to
fling
it
so
far
he
saw
atalanta
stoop
to
pick
up
the
apple
and
he
bounded
on
and
then
although
his
strength
was
failing
he
saw
the
goal
marks
near
him
he
set
his
feet
between
them
and
then
fell
down
on
the
ground
the
attendants
raised
him
up
and
put
the
victor
s
wreath
upon
his
head
the
concourse
of
people
shouted
with
joy
to
see
him
victor
but
he
looked
around
for
atalanta
and
he
saw
her
standing
there
with
the
golden
apples
in
her
hands
he
has
won
he
heard
her
say
and
i
have
not
to
hate
myself
for
bringing
a
doom
upon
him
gladly
gladly
do
i
give
up
the
race
and
glad
am
i
that
it
is
this
youth
who
has
won
the
victory
from
illustration
atalanta
s
last
race
she
took
his
hand
and
brought
him
before
the
king
then
schœneus
in
the
sight
of
all
the
rejoicing
people
gave
atalanta
to
hippomenes
for
his
bride
and
he
bestowed
upon
him
also
a
great
gift
of
horses
with
his
dear
and
bride
hippomenes
went
to
his
own
country
and
the
apples
that
she
brought
with
her
the
golden
apples
of
aphrodite

came
when

left

went
on
the
lemnian
land
he
gathered
the
heroes
about
him
and
they
seeing
heracles
come
amongst
them
clamored
to
go
to
hunt
the

were

from

for

spoke
to

that
they
were
forgetting

to
think
that
he
had
almost
let
go
out
of
his
mind
the
quest
that
had
brought
him
from
iolcus
and
then
he
thought
upon
hypsipyle
and
of
how
her
little

would
stay
in
his
and
his
own
hand
became
loose
upon

that
it

him

could
he

thought

he
heard
the
clear
voice
of
atalanta
as
she
too
spoke
to
the
argonauts
what
heracles
said

brave

back
from

were

by

who
carried

silent

with

on

was

sit
looking
into

on
the

of

and
seated
on
that
throne
she
spoke
to
jason
and
to
heracles
as
a
queen
might
speak
in
the
hall
that
night
the
heroes
and
the
lemnian
maidens
who
were
with
them
were
quiet
a
story
was
told
castor
began
it
and
polydeuces
ended
it
and
the
story
that
helen
s
brothers
told
was
the
golden
maid
epimetheus
the
titan
had
a
brother
who
was
the
wisest
of
all
called
the
foreseer
but
epimetheus
himself
was
and
his
wise
brother
once
sent
him
a
message
bidding
him
beware
of
the
gifts
that
zeus
might
send
him
epimetheus
heard
but
he
did
not
heed
the
warning
and
thereby
he
brought
upon
the
race
of
men
troubles
and
cares
prometheus
the
wise
titan
had
saved
men
from
a
great
trouble
that
zeus
would
have
brought
upon
them
also
he
had
given
them
the
gift
of
fire
zeus
was
the
more
wroth
with
men
now
because
fire
stolen
from
him
had
been
given
them
he
was
wroth
with
the
race
of
titans
too
and
he
pondered
in
his
heart
how
he
might
injure
men
and
how
he
might
use
epimetheus
the
mindless
titan
to
further
his
plan
while
he
pondered
there
was
a
hush
on
high
olympus
the
mountain
of
the
gods
then
zeus
called
upon
the
artisan
of
the
gods
lame
hephæstus
and
he
commanded
him
to
make
a
being
out
of
clay
that
would
have
the
likeness
of
a
lovely
maiden
with
joy
and
pride
hephæstus
worked
at
the
task
that
had
been
given
him
and
he
fashioned
a
being
that
had
the
likeness
of
a
lovely
maiden
and
he
brought
the
thing
of
his
making
before
the
gods
and
the
goddesses
all
strove
to
add
a
grace
or
a
beauty
to
the
work
of
hephæstus
zeus
granted
that
the
maiden
should
see
and
feel
athene
dressed
her
in
garments
that
were
as
lovely
as
flowers
aphrodite
the
goddess
of
love
put
a
charm
on
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
the
graces
put
necklaces
around
her
neck
and
set
a
golden
crown
upon
her
head
the
hours
brought
her
a
girdle
of
spring
flowers
then
the
herald
of
the
gods
gave
her
speech
that
was
sweet
and
flowing
all
the
gods
and
goddesses
had
given
gifts
to
her
and
for
that
reason
the
maiden
of
hephæstus
s
making
was
called
pandora
the
she
was
lovely
the
gods
knew
not
beautiful
as
they
themselves
are
who
have
a
beauty
that
awakens
reverence
rather
than
love
but
lovely
as
flowers
and
bright
waters
and
earthly
maidens
are
lovely
zeus
smiled
to
himself
when
he
looked
upon
her
and
he
called
to
hermes
who
knew
all
the
ways
of
the
earth
and
he
put
her
into
the
charge
of
hermes
also
he
gave
hermes
a
great
jar
to
take
along
this
jar
was
pandora
s
dower
epimetheus
lived
in
a
valley
now
one
day
as
he
was
sitting
on
a
fallen
pillar
in
the
ruined
place
that
was
now
forsaken
by
the
rest
of
the
titans
he
saw
a
pair
coming
toward
him
one
had
wings
and
he
knew
him
to
be
hermes
the
messenger
of
the
gods
the
other
was
a
maiden
epimetheus
marveled
at
the
crown
upon
her
head
and
at
her
lovely
garments
there
was
a
glint
of
gold
all
around
her
he
rose
from
where
he
sat
upon
the
broken
pillar
and
he
stood
to
watch
the
pair
hermes
he
saw
was
carrying
by
its
handle
a
great
jar
in
wonder
and
delight
he
looked
upon
the
maiden
epimetheus
had
seen
no
lovely
thing
for
ages
wonderful
indeed
was
this
golden
maid
and
as
she
came
nearer
the
charm
that
was
on
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
came
to
the
one
and
he
smiled
with
more
and
more
delight
illustration
hermes
came
and
stood
before
him
he
also
smiled
but
his
smile
had
something
baleful
in
it
he
put
the
hands
of
the
golden
maid
into
the
great
soft
hand
of
the
titan
and
he
said
o
epimetheus
father
zeus
would
be
reconciled
with
thee
and
as
a
sign
of
his
good
will
he
sends
thee
this
lovely
goddess
to
be
thy
oh
very
foolish
was
epimetheus
the
one
as
he
looked
upon
the
golden
maid
who
was
sent
by
zeus
he
lost
memory
of
the
wars
that
zeus
had
made
upon
the
titans
and
the
elder
gods
he
lost
memory
of
his
brother
chained
by
zeus
to
the
rock
he
lost
memory
of
the
warning
that
his
brother
the
wisest
of
all
beings
had
sent
him
he
took
the
hands
of
pandora
and
he
thought
of
nothing
at
all
in
all
the
world
but
her
very
far
away
seemed
the
voice
of
hermes
saying
this
jar
too
is
from
olympus
it
has
in
it
pandora
s
the
jar
stood
forgotten
for
long
and
green
plants
grew
over
it
while
epimetheus
walked
in
the
garden
with
the
golden
maid
or
watched
her
while
she
gazed
on
herself
in
the
stream
or
searched
in
the
untended
places
for
the
fruits
that
the
elder
gods
would
eat
when
they
feasted
with
the
titans
in
the
old
days
before
zeus
had
come
to
his
power
and
lost
to
epimetheus
was
the
memory
of
his
brother
now
suffering
upon
the
rock
because
of
the
gift
he
had
given
to
men
and
pandora
knowing
nothing
except
the
brightness
of
the
sunshine
and
the
lovely
shapes
and
colors
of
things
and
the
sweet
taste
of
the
fruits
that
epimetheus
brought
to
her
could
have
stayed
forever
in
that
garden
but
every
day
epimetheus
would
think
that
the
men
and
women
of
the
world
should
be
able
to
talk
to
him
about
this
maiden
with
the
wonderful
radiance
of
gold
and
with
the
lovely
garments
and
the
marvelous
crown
and
one
day
he
took
pandora
by
the
hand
and
he
brought
her
out
of
that
valley
and
toward
the
homes
of
men
he
did
not
forget
the
jar
that
hermes
had
left
with
her
all
things
that
belonged
to
the
golden
maid
were
precious
and
epimetheus
took
the
jar
along
the
race
of
men
at
the
time
were
simple
and
content
their
days
were
passed
in
toil
but
now
since
prometheus
had
given
them
fire
they
had
good
fruits
of
their
toil
they
had
tools
to
dig
the
earth
and
to
build
houses
their
homes
were
warmed
with
fire
and
fire
burned
upon
the
altars
that
were
upon
their
ways
greatly
they
reverenced
prometheus
who
had
given
them
fire
and
greatly
they
reverenced
the
race
of
the
titans
so
when
epimetheus
came
amongst
them
tall
as
a
man
walking
with
stilts
they
welcomed
him
and
brought
him
and
the
golden
maid
to
their
hearths
and
epimetheus
showed
pandora
the
wonderful
element
that
his
brother
had
given
to
men
and
she
rejoiced
to
see
the
fire
clapping
her
hands
with
delight
the
jar
that
epimetheus
brought
he
left
in
an
open
place
in
carrying
it
up
the
rough
ways
out
of
the
valley
epimetheus
may
have
knocked
the
jar
about
for
the
lid
that
had
been
tight
upon
it
now
fitted
very
loosely
but
no
one
gave
heed
to
the
jar
as
it
stood
in
the
open
space
where
epimetheus
had
left
it
at
first
the
men
and
women
looked
upon
the
beauty
of
pandora
upon
her
lovely
dresses
and
her
golden
crown
and
her
girdle
of
flowers
with
wonder
and
delight
epimetheus
would
have
every
one
admire
and
praise
her
the
men
would
leave
off
working
in
the
fields
or
hammering
on
iron
or
building
houses
and
the
women
would
leave
off
spinning
or
weaving
and
come
at
his
call
and
stand
about
and
admire
the
golden
maid
but
as
time
went
by
a
change
came
upon
the
women
one
woman
would
weep
and
another
would
look
angry
and
a
third
would
go
back
sullenly
to
her
work
when
pandora
was
admired
or
praised
once
the
women
were
gathered
together
and
one
who
was
the
wisest
amongst
them
said
once
we
did
not
think
about
ourselves
and
we
were
content
but
now
we
think
about
ourselves
and
we
say
to
ourselves
that
we
are
harsh
and
indeed
compared
to
the
golden
maid
that
the
titan
is
so
enchanted
with
and
we
hate
to
see
our
own
men
praise
and
admire
her
and
often
in
our
hearts
we
would
destroy
her
if
we
that
is
true
the
women
said
and
then
a
young
woman
cried
out
in
a
most
yearnful
voice
o
tell
us
you
who
are
wise
how
can
we
make
ourselves
as
beautiful
as
pandora
then
said
that
woman
who
was
thought
to
be
wise
this
golden
maid
is
lovely
to
look
upon
because
she
has
lovely
apparel
and
all
the
means
of
keeping
herself
lovely
the
gods
have
given
her
the
ways
and
so
her
skin
remains
fair
and
her
hair
keeps
its
gold
and
her
lips
are
ever
red
and
her
eyes
shining
and
i
think
that
the
means
that
she
has
of
keeping
lovely
are
all
in
that
jar
that
epimetheus
brought
with
when
the
woman
who
was
thought
to
be
wise
said
this
those
around
her
were
silent
for
a
while
but
then
one
arose
and
another
arose
and
they
stood
and
whispered
together
one
saying
to
the
other
that
they
should
go
to
the
place
where
the
jar
had
been
left
by
epimetheus
and
that
they
should
take
out
of
it
the
salves
and
the
charms
and
the
washes
that
would
leave
them
as
beautiful
as
pandora
so
the
women
went
to
that
place
on
their
way
they
stopped
at
a
pool
and
they
bent
over
to
see
themselves
mirrored
in
it
and
they
saw
themselves
with
dusty
and
unkempt
hair
with
large
and
knotted
hands
with
troubled
eyes
and
with
anxious
mouths
they
frowned
as
they
looked
upon
their
images
and
they
said
in
harsh
voices
that
in
a
while
they
would
have
ways
of
making
themselves
as
lovely
as
the
golden
maid
illustration
and
as
they
went
on
they
saw
pandora
she
was
playing
in
a
flowering
field
while
epimetheus
high
as
a
man
upon
stilts
went
gathering
the
blossoms
of
the
bushes
for
her
they
went
on
and
they
came
at
last
to
the
place
where
epimetheus
had
left
the
jar
that
held
pandora
s
dower
a
great
stone
jar
it
was
there
was
no
bird
nor
flower
nor
branch
painted
upon
it
it
stood
high
as
a
woman
s
shoulder
and
as
the
women
looked
on
it
they
thought
that
there
were
things
enough
in
it
to
keep
them
beautiful
for
all
the
days
of
their
lives
but
each
one
thought
that
she
should
not
be
the
last
to
get
her
hands
into
it
once
the
lid
had
been
fixed
tightly
down
on
the
jar
but
the
lid
was
shifted
a
little
now
as
the
hands
of
the
women
grasped
it
to
take
off
the
lid
the
jar
was
cast
down
and
the
things
that
were
inside
spilled
themselves
forth
they
were
black
and
gray
and
red
they
were
crawling
and
flying
things
and
as
the
women
looked
the
things
spread
themselves
abroad
or
fastened
themselves
upon
them
the
jar
like
pandora
herself
had
been
made
and
filled
out
of
the
ill
will
of
zeus
and
it
had
been
filled
not
with
salves
and
charms
and
washes
as
the
women
had
thought
but
with
cares
and
troubles
before
the
women
came
to
it
one
trouble
had
already
come
forth
from
the
that
was
upon
the
top
of
the
heap
it
was
that
had
afflicted
the
women
making
them
troubled
about
their
own
looks
and
envious
of
the
graces
of
the
golden
maid
and
now
the
others
spread
themselves
and
war
and
strife
between
friends
they
spread
themselves
abroad
and
entered
the
houses
while
epimetheus
the
mindless
titan
gathered
flowers
for
pandora
the
golden
maid
lest
she
should
weary
of
her
play
he
called
to
her
he
would
take
her
into
the
houses
of
men
as
they
drew
near
to
the
houses
they
saw
a
woman
seated
on
the
ground
weeping
her
husband
had
suddenly
become
hard
to
her
and
had
shut
the
door
on
her
face
they
came
upon
a
child
crying
because
of
a
pain
that
he
could
not
understand
and
then
they
found
two
men
struggling
their
strife
being
on
account
of
a
possession
that
they
had
both
held
peaceably
before
in
every
house
they
went
to
epimetheus
would
say
i
am
the
brother
of
prometheus
who
gave
you
the
gift
of
but
instead
of
giving
them
a
welcome
the
men
would
say
we
know
nothing
about
your
relation
to
prometheus
we
see
you
as
a
foolish
man
upon
epimetheus
was
troubled
by
the
hard
looks
and
the
cold
words
of
the
men
who
once
had
reverenced
him
he
turned
from
the
houses
and
went
away
in
a
quiet
place
he
sat
down
and
for
a
while
he
lost
sight
of
pandora
and
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
wise
and
suffering
brother
saying
do
not
accept
any
gift
that
zeus
may
send
he
rose
up
and
he
hurried
away
from
that
place
leaving
pandora
playing
by
herself
there
came
into
his
scattered
mind
regret
and
fear
as
he
went
on
he
stumbled
he
fell
from
the
edge
of
a
cliff
and
the
sea
washed
away
the
body
of
the
mindless
brother
of
prometheus
not
everything
had
been
spilled
out
of
the
jar
that
had
been
brought
with
pandora
into
the
world
of
men
a
beautiful
living
thing
was
in
that
jar
also
this
was
hope
and
this
beautiful
living
thing
had
got
caught
under
the
rim
of
the
jar
and
had
not
come
forth
with
the
others
one
day
a
weeping
woman
found
hope
under
the
rim
of
pandora
s
jar
and
brought
this
living
thing
into
the
house
of
men
and
now
because
of
hope
they
could
see
an
end
to
their
troubles
and
the
men
and
women
roused
themselves
in
the
midst
of
their
afflictions
and
they
looked
toward
gladness
hope
that
had
been
caught
under
the
rim
of
the
jar
stayed
behind
the
thresholds
of
their
houses
as
for
pandora
the
golden
maid
she
played
on
knowing
only
the
brightness
of
the
sunshine
and
the
lovely
shapes
of
things
beautiful
would
she
have
seemed
to
any
being
who
saw
her
but
now
she
had
strayed
away
from
the
houses
of
men
and
epimetheus
was
not
there
to
look
upon
her
then
hephæstus
the
lame
artisan
of
the
gods
left
down
his
tools
and
went
to
seek
her
he
found
pandora
and
he
took
her
back
to
olympus
and
in
his
brazen
house
she
stays
though
sometimes
at
the
will
of
zeus
she
goes
down
into
the
world
of
men
when
polydeuces
had
ended
the
story
that
castor
had
begun
heracles
cried
out
for
the
argonauts
too
there
has
been
a
golden
not
one
but
a
golden
maid
for
each
out
of
the
jar
that
has
been
with
her
ye
have
taken
forgetfulness
of
your
honor
as
for
me
i
go
back
to
the
lest
one
of
these
golden
maids
should
hold
me
back
from
the
labors
that
make
great
a
so
heracles
said
and
he
went
from
hypsipyle
s
hall
the
heroes
looked
at
each
other
and
they
stood
up
and
shame
that
they
had
stayed
so
long
away
from
the
quest
came
over
each
of
them
the
maidens
took
their
hands
the
heroes
unloosed
those
soft
hands
and
turned
away
from
them
hypsipyle
left
the
throne
of
king
thoas
and
stood
before
jason
there
was
a
storm
in
all
her
body
her
mouth
was
shaken
and
a
whole
life
s
trouble
was
in
her
great
eyes
before
she
spoke
jason
cried
out
what
heracles
said
is
true
o
argonauts
on
the
quest
of
the
golden
fleece
our
lives
and
our
honors
depend
to
colchis
must
we
go
he
stood
upright
in
the
hall
and
his
comrades
gathered
around
him
the
lemnian
maidens
would
have
held
out
their
arms
and
would
have
made
their
partings
long
delayed
but
that
a
strange
cry
came
to
them
through
the
night
well
did
the
argonauts
know
that
was
the
cry
of
the
ship
of
herself
they
knew
that
they
must
go
to
her
now
or
stay
from
the
voyage
for
ever
and
the
maidens
knew
that
there
was
something
in
the
cry
of
the
ship
that
might
not
be
gainsaid
and
they
put
their
hands
before
their
faces
and
they
said
no
other
word
illustration
then
said
hypsipyle
the
queen
i
too
am
a
ruler
jason
and
i
know
that
there
are
great
commands
that
we
have
to
obey
go
then
to
the
ah
neither
i
nor
the
women
of
lemnos
will
stay
your
going
now
but
speak
to
us
from
the
deck
of
the
ship
and
bid
us
farewell
do
not
go
from
us
in
the
night
jason
and
the
argonauts
went
from
hypsipyle
s
hall
the
maidens
who
were
left
behind
wept
together
all
but
hypsipyle
she
sat
on
the
throne
of
king
thoas
and
she
had
polyxo
her
nurse
tell
her
of
the
ways
of
jason
s
voyage
as
he
had
told
of
them
and
of
all
that
he
would
have
to
pass
through
when
the
other
lemnian
women
slept
she
put
her
head
upon
her
nurse
s
knees
and
wept
bitterly
hypsipyle
wept
but
softly
for
she
would
not
have
the
others
hear
her
weeping
by
the
coming
of
the
morning
s
light
the
argonauts
had
made
all
ready
for
their
sailing
they
were
standing
on
the
deck
when
the
light
came
and
they
saw
the
lemnian
women
come
to
the
shore
each
looked
at
her
friend
aboard
the
and
spoke
and
went
away
and
last
hypsipyle
the
queen
came
farewell
hypsipyle
jason
said
to
her
and
she
in
her
strange
way
of
speaking
said
what
you
told
us
i
have
you
will
come
to
the
dangerous
passage
that
leads
into
the
sea
of
pontus
and
how
by
the
flight
of
a
pigeon
you
will
know
whether
or
not
you
may
go
that
way
o
jason
let
the
dove
you
fly
when
you
come
to
that
dangerous
place
be
hypsipyle
she
showed
a
pigeon
held
in
her
hands
she
loosed
it
and
the
pigeon
alighted
on
the
ship
and
stayed
there
on
pink
feet
a
pigeon
jason
took
up
the
pigeon
and
held
it
in
his
hands
and
the
drew
swiftly
away
from
the
lemnian
land
xi
the
passage
of
the
symplegades
decorative
first
letter
came
near
salmydessus
where
phineus
the
wise
king
ruled
and
they
sailed
past
it
they
sighted
the
pile
of
stones
with
the
oar
upright
upon
it
that
they
had
raised
on
the
seashore
over
the
body
of
tiphys
the
skillful
steersman
whom
they
had
lost
they
sailed
on
until
they
heard
a
sound
that
grew
more
and
more
thunderous
and
then
the
heroes
said
to
each
other
now
we
come
to
the
symplegades
and
the
dread
passage
into
the
sea
of
it
was
then
that
jason
cried
out
ah
when
pelias
spoke
of
this
quest
to
me
why
did
i
not
turn
my
head
away
and
refuse
to
be
drawn
into
it
since
we
came
near
the
dread
passage
that
is
before
us
i
have
passed
every
night
in
groans
as
for
you
who
have
come
with
me
you
may
take
your
ease
for
you
need
care
only
for
your
own
lives
but
i
have
to
care
for
you
all
and
to
strive
to
win
for
you
all
a
safe
return
to
greece
ah
greatly
am
i
afflicted
now
knowing
to
what
a
great
peril
i
have
brought
you
so
jason
said
thinking
to
make
trial
of
the
heroes
they
on
their
part
were
not
dismayed
but
shouted
back
cheerful
words
to
him
then
he
said
o
friends
of
mine
by
your
spirit
my
spirit
is
quickened
now
if
i
knew
that
i
was
being
borne
down
into
the
black
gulfs
of
hades
i
should
fear
nothing
knowing
that
you
are
constant
and
faithful
of
as
he
said
this
they
came
into
water
that
seethed
all
around
the
ship
then
into
the
hands
of
euphemus
a
youth
of
iolcus
who
was
the
amongst
the
argonauts
jason
put
the
pigeon
that
hypsipyle
had
given
him
he
bade
him
stand
by
the
prow
of
the
ready
to
loose
the
pigeon
as
the
ship
came
nigh
that
dreadful
gate
of
rock
they
saw
the
spray
being
dashed
around
in
showers
they
saw
the
sea
spread
itself
out
in
foam
they
saw
the
high
black
rocks
rush
together
sounding
thunderously
as
they
met
the
caves
in
the
high
rocks
rumbled
as
the
sea
surged
into
them
and
the
foam
of
the
dashing
waves
spurted
high
up
the
rocks
jason
shouted
to
each
man
to
grip
hard
on
the
oars
the
dashed
on
as
the
rocks
rushed
toward
each
other
again
then
there
was
such
noise
that
no
man
s
voice
could
be
heard
above
it
as
the
rocks
met
euphemus
loosed
the
pigeon
with
his
keen
eyes
he
watched
her
fly
through
the
spray
would
she
not
finding
an
opening
to
fly
through
turn
back
he
watched
and
meanwhile
the
argonauts
gripped
hard
on
the
oars
to
save
the
ship
from
being
dashed
on
the
rocks
the
pigeon
fluttered
as
though
she
would
sink
down
and
let
the
spray
drown
her
and
then
euphemus
saw
her
raise
herself
and
fly
forward
toward
the
place
where
she
had
flown
he
pointed
the
rowers
gave
a
loud
cry
and
jason
called
upon
them
to
pull
with
might
and
main
the
rocks
were
parting
asunder
and
to
the
right
and
left
broad
pontus
was
seen
by
the
heroes
then
suddenly
a
huge
wave
rose
before
them
and
at
the
sight
of
it
they
all
uttered
a
cry
and
bent
their
heads
it
seemed
to
them
that
it
would
dash
down
on
the
whole
ship
s
length
and
overwhelm
them
all
but
nauplius
was
quick
to
ease
the
ship
and
the
wave
rolled
away
beneath
the
keel
and
at
the
stern
it
raised
the
and
dashed
her
away
from
the
rocks
they
felt
the
sun
as
it
streamed
upon
them
through
the
sundered
rocks
they
strained
at
the
oars
until
the
oars
bent
like
bows
in
their
hands
the
ship
sprang
forward
surely
they
were
now
in
the
wide
sea
of
pontus
the
argonauts
shouted
they
saw
the
rocks
behind
them
with
the
sea
fowl
screaming
upon
them
surely
they
were
in
the
sea
of
sea
that
had
never
been
entered
before
through
the
rocks
wandering
the
rocks
no
longer
dashed
together
each
remained
fixed
in
its
place
for
it
was
the
will
of
the
gods
that
these
rocks
should
no
more
clash
together
after
a
mortal
s
ship
had
passed
between
them
they
were
now
in
the
sea
of
pontus
the
sea
into
which
flowed
the
river
that
colchis
was
river
phasis
and
now
above
jason
s
head
the
bird
of
peaceful
days
the
halcyon
fluttered
and
the
argonauts
knew
that
this
was
a
sign
from
the
gods
that
the
voyage
would
not
any
more
be
troublous
xii
the
mountain
caucasus
decorative
first
letter
rested
in
the
harbor
of
thynias
the
desert
island
and
sailing
from
there
they
came
to
the
land
of
the
mariandyni
a
people
who
were
constantly
at
war
with
the
bebrycians
there
the
hero
polydeuces
was
welcomed
as
a
god
twelve
days
afterward
they
passed
the
mouth
of
the
river
callichorus
then
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
that
river
that
flows
through
the
land
of
the
amazons
the
river
thermodon
fourteen
days
from
that
place
brought
them
to
the
island
that
is
filled
with
the
birds
of
ares
the
god
of
war
these
birds
dropped
upon
the
heroes
heavy
pointed
feathers
that
would
have
pierced
them
as
arrows
if
they
had
not
covered
themselves
with
their
shields
then
by
shouting
and
by
striking
their
shields
with
their
spears
they
raised
such
a
clamor
as
drove
the
birds
away
they
sailed
on
borne
by
a
gentle
breeze
until
a
gulf
of
the
sea
opened
before
them
and
lo
a
mountain
that
they
knew
bore
some
mighty
name
orpheus
looking
on
its
peak
and
its
crags
said
lo
now
we
the
argonauts
are
looking
upon
the
mountain
that
is
named
caucasus
when
he
declared
the
name
the
heroes
all
stood
up
and
looked
on
the
mountain
with
awe
and
in
awe
they
cried
out
a
name
and
that
name
was
prometheus
for
upon
that
mountain
the
titan
god
was
held
his
limbs
bound
upon
the
hard
rocks
by
fetters
of
bronze
even
as
the
argonauts
looked
toward
the
mountain
a
great
shadow
fell
upon
their
ship
and
looking
up
they
saw
a
monstrous
bird
flying
the
beat
of
the
bird
s
wings
filled
out
the
sail
and
drove
the
swiftly
onward
it
is
the
bird
sent
by
zeus
orpheus
said
it
is
the
vulture
that
every
day
devours
the
liver
of
the
titan
they
cowered
down
on
the
ship
as
they
heard
that
the
argonauts
save
heracles
he
stood
upright
and
looked
out
toward
where
the
bird
was
flying
then
as
the
bird
came
near
to
the
mountain
the
argonauts
heard
a
great
cry
of
anguish
go
up
from
the
rocks
it
is
prometheus
crying
out
as
the
bird
of
zeus
flies
down
upon
him
they
said
to
one
another
again
they
cowered
down
on
the
ship
all
save
heracles
who
stayed
looking
toward
where
the
great
vulture
had
flown
the
night
came
and
the
argonauts
sailed
on
in
silence
thinking
in
awe
of
the
titan
god
and
of
the
doom
that
zeus
had
inflicted
upon
him
then
as
they
sailed
on
under
the
stars
orpheus
told
them
of
prometheus
of
his
gift
to
men
and
of
the
fearful
punishment
that
had
been
meted
out
to
him
by
zeus
prometheus
the
gods
more
than
once
made
a
race
of
men
the
first
was
a
golden
race
very
close
to
the
gods
who
dwell
on
olympus
was
this
golden
race
they
lived
justly
although
there
were
no
laws
to
compel
them
in
the
time
of
the
golden
race
the
earth
knew
only
one
season
and
that
season
was
everlasting
spring
the
men
and
women
of
the
golden
race
lived
through
a
span
of
life
that
was
far
beyond
that
of
the
men
and
women
of
our
day
and
when
they
died
it
was
as
though
sleep
had
become
everlasting
with
them
they
had
all
good
things
and
that
without
labor
for
the
earth
without
any
forcing
bestowed
fruits
and
crops
upon
them
they
had
peace
all
through
their
lives
this
golden
race
and
after
they
had
passed
away
their
spirits
remained
above
the
earth
inspiring
the
men
of
the
race
that
came
after
them
to
do
great
and
gracious
things
and
to
act
justly
and
kindly
to
one
another
after
the
golden
race
had
passed
away
the
gods
made
for
the
earth
a
second
silver
race
less
noble
in
spirit
and
in
body
was
this
silver
race
and
the
seasons
that
visited
them
were
less
gracious
in
the
time
of
the
silver
race
the
gods
made
the
and
spring
and
autumn
and
winter
they
knew
parching
heat
and
the
bitter
winds
of
winter
and
snow
and
rain
and
hail
it
was
the
men
of
the
silver
race
who
first
built
houses
for
shelter
they
lived
through
a
span
of
life
that
was
longer
than
our
span
but
it
was
not
long
enough
to
give
wisdom
to
them
children
were
brought
up
at
their
mothers
sides
for
a
hundred
years
playing
at
childish
things
and
when
they
came
to
years
beyond
a
hundred
they
quarreled
with
one
another
and
wronged
one
another
and
did
not
know
enough
to
give
reverence
to
the
immortal
gods
then
by
the
will
of
zeus
the
silver
race
passed
away
as
the
golden
race
had
passed
away
their
spirits
stay
in
the
underworld
and
they
are
called
by
men
the
blessed
spirits
of
the
underworld
and
then
there
was
made
the
third
race
of
bronze
they
were
a
race
great
of
stature
terrible
and
strong
their
armor
was
of
bronze
their
swords
were
of
bronze
their
implements
were
of
bronze
and
of
bronze
too
they
made
their
houses
no
great
span
of
life
was
theirs
for
with
the
weapons
that
they
took
in
their
terrible
hands
they
slew
one
another
thus
they
passed
away
and
went
down
under
the
earth
to
hades
leaving
no
name
that
men
might
know
them
by
then
the
gods
created
a
fourth
own
a
race
of
iron
we
have
not
the
justice
that
was
amongst
the
men
of
the
golden
race
nor
the
simpleness
that
was
amongst
the
men
of
the
silver
race
nor
the
stature
nor
the
great
strength
that
the
men
of
the
bronze
race
possessed
we
are
of
iron
that
we
may
endure
it
is
our
doom
that
we
must
never
cease
from
labor
and
that
we
must
very
quickly
grow
old
but
miserable
as
we
are
there
was
a
time
when
the
lot
of
men
was
more
miserable
with
poor
implements
they
had
to
labor
on
a
hard
ground
there
was
less
justice
and
kindliness
amongst
men
in
those
days
than
there
is
now
once
it
came
into
the
mind
of
zeus
that
he
would
destroy
the
fourth
race
and
leave
the
earth
to
the
nymphs
and
the
satyrs
he
would
destroy
it
by
a
great
flood
but
prometheus
the
titan
god
who
had
given
aid
to
zeus
against
the
other
who
was
called
the
not
consent
to
the
race
of
men
being
destroyed
utterly
and
he
considered
a
way
of
saving
some
of
them
to
a
man
and
a
woman
deucalion
and
pyrrha
just
and
gentle
people
he
brought
word
of
the
plan
of
zeus
and
he
showed
them
how
to
make
a
ship
that
would
bear
them
through
what
was
about
to
be
sent
upon
the
earth
then
zeus
shut
up
in
their
cave
all
the
winds
but
the
wind
that
brings
rain
and
clouds
he
bade
this
wind
the
south
wind
sweep
over
the
earth
flooding
it
with
rain
he
called
upon
poseidon
and
bade
him
to
let
the
sea
pour
in
upon
the
land
and
poseidon
commanded
the
rivers
to
put
forth
all
their
strength
and
sweep
dykes
away
and
overflow
their
banks
the
clouds
and
the
sea
and
the
rivers
poured
upon
the
earth
the
flood
rose
higher
and
higher
and
in
the
places
where
the
pretty
lambs
had
played
the
ugly
sea
calves
now
gambolled
men
in
their
boats
drew
fishes
out
of
the
tops
of
elm
trees
and
the
water
nymphs
were
amazed
to
come
on
men
s
cities
under
the
waves
soon
even
the
men
and
women
who
had
boats
were
overwhelmed
by
the
rise
of
perished
then
except
deucalion
and
pyrrha
his
wife
them
the
waves
had
not
overwhelmed
for
they
were
in
a
ship
that
prometheus
had
shown
them
how
to
build
the
flood
went
down
at
last
and
deucalion
and
pyrrha
climbed
up
to
a
high
and
a
dry
ground
zeus
saw
that
two
of
the
race
of
men
had
been
left
alive
but
he
saw
that
these
two
were
just
and
kindly
and
had
a
right
reverence
for
the
gods
he
spared
them
and
he
saw
their
children
again
peopling
the
earth
prometheus
who
had
saved
them
looked
on
the
men
and
women
of
the
earth
with
compassion
their
labor
was
hard
and
they
wrought
much
to
gain
little
they
were
chilled
at
night
in
their
houses
and
the
winds
that
blew
in
the
daytime
made
the
old
men
and
women
bend
double
like
a
wheel
prometheus
thought
to
himself
that
if
men
and
women
had
the
element
that
only
the
gods
knew
element
of
could
make
for
themselves
implements
for
labor
they
could
build
houses
that
would
keep
out
the
chilling
winds
and
they
could
warm
themselves
at
the
blaze
but
the
gods
had
not
willed
that
men
should
have
fire
and
to
go
against
the
will
of
the
gods
would
be
impious
prometheus
went
against
the
will
of
the
gods
he
stole
fire
from
the
altar
of
zeus
and
he
hid
it
in
a
hollow
fennel
stalk
and
he
brought
it
to
men
illustration
prometheus
then
men
were
able
to
hammer
iron
into
tools
and
cut
down
forests
with
axes
and
sow
grain
where
the
forests
had
been
then
were
they
able
to
make
houses
that
the
storms
could
not
overthrow
and
they
were
able
to
warm
themselves
at
hearth
fires
they
had
rest
from
their
labor
at
times
they
built
cities
they
became
beings
who
no
longer
had
heads
and
backs
bent
but
were
able
to
raise
their
faces
even
to
the
gods
and
zeus
spared
the
race
of
men
who
had
now
the
sacred
element
of
fire
but
he
knew
that
prometheus
had
stolen
this
fire
even
from
his
own
altar
and
had
given
it
to
men
and
he
thought
on
how
he
might
punish
the
great
titan
god
for
his
impiety
he
brought
back
from
the
underworld
the
giants
that
he
had
put
there
to
guard
the
titans
that
had
been
hurled
down
to
tartarus
he
brought
back
gyes
cottus
and
briareus
and
he
commanded
them
to
lay
hands
upon
prometheus
and
to
fasten
him
with
fetters
to
the
highest
blackest
crag
upon
caucasus
and
briareus
cottus
and
gyes
seized
upon
the
titan
god
and
carried
him
to
caucasus
and
fettered
him
with
fetters
of
bronze
to
the
highest
blackest
fetters
of
bronze
that
may
not
be
broken
there
they
have
left
the
titan
stretched
under
the
sky
with
the
cold
winds
blowing
upon
him
and
with
the
sun
streaming
down
on
him
and
that
his
punishment
might
exceed
all
other
punishments
zeus
had
sent
a
vulture
to
prey
upon
vulture
that
tears
at
his
liver
each
day
and
yet
prometheus
does
not
cry
out
that
he
has
repented
of
his
gift
to
man
although
the
winds
blow
upon
him
and
the
sun
streams
upon
him
and
the
vulture
tears
at
his
liver
prometheus
will
not
cry
out
his
repentance
to
heaven
and
zeus
may
not
utterly
destroy
him
for
prometheus
the
foreseer
knows
a
secret
that
zeus
would
fain
have
him
disclose
he
knows
that
even
as
zeus
overthrew
his
father
and
made
himself
the
ruler
in
his
stead
so
too
another
will
overthrow
zeus
and
one
day
zeus
will
have
to
have
the
fetters
broken
from
around
the
limbs
of
prometheus
and
will
have
to
bring
from
the
rock
and
the
vulture
and
into
the
council
of
the
olympians
the
unyielding
titan
god
when
the
light
of
the
morning
came
the
was
very
near
to
the
mountain
caucasus
the
voyagers
looked
in
awe
upon
its
black
crags
they
saw
the
great
vulture
circling
over
a
high
rock
and
from
beneath
where
the
vulture
circled
they
heard
a
weary
cry
then
heracles
who
all
night
had
stood
by
the
mast
cried
out
to
the
argonauts
to
bring
the
ship
near
to
a
landing
place
but
jason
would
not
have
them
go
near
fear
of
the
wrath
of
zeus
was
strong
upon
him
rather
he
bade
the
argonauts
put
all
their
strength
into
their
rowing
and
draw
far
off
from
that
forbidden
mountain
heracles
not
heeding
what
jason
ordered
declared
that
it
was
his
purpose
to
make
his
way
up
to
the
black
crag
and
with
his
shield
and
his
sword
in
his
hands
slay
the
vulture
that
preyed
upon
the
liver
of
prometheus
illustration
then
orpheus
in
a
clear
voice
spoke
to
the
argonauts
surely
some
spirit
possesses
heracles
he
said
despite
all
we
do
or
say
he
will
make
his
way
to
where
prometheus
is
fettered
to
the
rock
do
not
gainsay
him
in
this
remember
what
nereus
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
declared
did
nereus
not
say
that
a
great
labor
awaited
heracles
and
that
in
the
doing
of
it
he
should
work
out
the
will
of
zeus
stay
him
not
how
just
it
would
be
if
he
who
is
the
son
of
zeus
freed
from
his
torments
the
titan
god
so
orpheus
said
in
his
clear
commanding
voice
they
drew
near
to
the
mountain
caucasus
then
heracles
gripping
the
sword
and
shield
that
were
the
gifts
of
the
gods
sprang
out
on
the
landing
place
the
argonauts
shouted
farewell
to
him
but
he
filled
as
he
was
with
an
overmastering
spirit
did
not
heed
their
words
a
strong
breeze
drove
them
onward
darkness
came
down
and
the
went
on
through
the
night
with
the
morning
light
those
who
were
sleeping
were
awakened
by
the
cry
of
lo
the
phasis
and
the
utmost
bourne
of
the
sea
they
sprang
up
and
looked
with
many
strange
feelings
upon
the
broad
river
they
had
come
to
here
was
the
phasis
emptying
itself
into
the
sea
of
pontus
up
that
river
was
colchis
and
the
city
of
king
æetes
the
end
of
their
voyage
the
place
where
was
kept
the
golden
fleece
quickly
they
let
down
the
sail
they
lowered
the
mast
and
they
laid
it
along
the
deck
strongly
they
grasped
the
oars
they
swung
the
around
and
they
entered
the
broad
stream
of
the
phasis
up
the
river
they
went
with
the
mountain
caucasus
on
their
left
hand
and
on
their
right
the
groves
and
gardens
of
aea
king
æetes
s
city
as
they
went
up
the
stream
jason
poured
from
a
golden
cup
an
offering
to
the
gods
and
to
the
dead
heroes
of
that
country
the
argonauts
prayed
for
good
fortune
to
their
enterprise
it
was
jason
s
counsel
that
they
should
not
at
once
appear
before
king
æetes
but
visit
him
after
they
had
seen
the
strength
of
his
city
they
drew
their
ship
into
a
shaded
backwater
and
there
they
stayed
while
day
grew
and
faded
around
them
night
came
and
the
heroes
slept
upon
the
deck
of
many
things
came
back
to
them
in
their
dreams
or
through
their
they
thought
of
the
lemnian
maidens
they
had
parted
from
of
the
clashing
rocks
they
had
passed
between
of
the
look
in
the
eyes
of
heracles
as
he
raised
his
face
to
the
high
black
peak
of
caucasus
they
slept
and
they
thought
they
saw
before
them
the
golden
fleece
darkness
surrounded
it
it
seemed
to
the
dreaming
argonauts
that
the
darkness
was
the
magic
power
that
king
æetes
possessed
part
ii
the
return
to
greece
i
king
æetes
decorative
first
letter
had
come
into
a
country
that
was
the
strangest
of
all
countries
and
amongst
a
people
that
were
the
strangest
of
all
peoples
they
were
in
the
land
this
people
said
before
the
moon
had
come
into
the
sky
and
it
is
true
that
when
the
great
king
of
egypt
had
come
so
far
finding
in
all
other
places
men
living
on
the
high
hills
and
eating
the
acorns
that
grew
on
the
oaks
there
he
found
in
colchis
the
city
of
aea
with
a
wall
around
it
and
with
pillars
on
which
writings
were
graven
that
was
when
egypt
was
called
the
morning
land
and
many
of
the
magicians
of
egypt
who
had
come
with
king
sesostris
stayed
in
that
city
of
aea
and
they
taught
people
spells
that
could
stay
the
moon
in
her
going
and
coming
in
her
rising
and
setting
priests
of
the
moon
ruled
the
city
of
aea
until
king
æetes
came
æetes
had
no
need
of
their
magic
for
helios
the
bright
sun
was
his
father
as
he
thought
also
hephæstus
the
artisan
of
the
gods
was
his
friend
and
hephæstus
made
for
him
many
wonderful
things
to
be
his
protection
medea
too
his
wise
daughter
knew
the
secrets
taught
by
those
who
could
sway
the
moon
but
æetes
once
was
made
afraid
by
a
dream
that
he
had
he
dreamt
that
a
ship
had
come
up
the
phasis
and
then
sailing
on
a
mist
had
rammed
his
palace
that
was
standing
there
in
all
its
strength
and
beauty
until
it
had
fallen
down
on
the
morning
of
the
night
that
he
had
had
this
dream
æetes
called
medea
his
wise
daughter
and
he
bade
her
go
to
the
temple
of
hecate
the
moon
and
search
out
spells
that
might
destroy
those
who
came
against
his
city
that
morning
the
argonauts
who
had
passed
the
night
in
the
backwater
of
the
river
had
two
youths
come
to
them
they
were
in
a
broken
ship
and
they
had
one
oar
only
when
jason
after
giving
them
food
and
fresh
garments
questioned
them
he
found
out
that
these
youths
were
of
the
city
of
aea
and
that
they
were
none
others
than
the
sons
of
phrixus
who
had
come
there
with
the
golden
ram
and
the
youths
phrontis
and
melas
were
as
amazed
as
was
jason
when
they
found
out
whose
ship
they
had
come
aboard
for
jason
was
the
grandson
of
cretheus
and
cretheus
was
the
brother
of
athamas
their
grandfather
they
had
ventured
from
aea
where
they
had
been
reared
thinking
to
reach
the
country
of
athamas
and
lay
claim
to
his
possessions
but
they
had
been
wrecked
at
a
place
not
far
from
the
mouth
of
the
phasis
and
with
great
pain
and
struggle
they
had
made
their
way
back
they
were
fearful
of
aea
and
of
their
uncle
king
æetes
and
they
would
gladly
go
with
jason
and
the
argonauts
back
to
greece
they
would
help
jason
they
said
to
persuade
æetes
to
give
the
golden
fleece
peaceably
to
them
their
mother
was
the
daughter
of
whom
the
king
had
given
in
marriage
to
phrixus
his
guest
a
council
of
the
argonauts
was
held
and
it
was
agreed
that
jason
should
go
with
two
comrades
to
king
æetes
phrontis
and
melas
going
also
they
were
to
ask
the
king
to
give
them
the
golden
fleece
and
to
offer
him
a
recompense
jason
took
peleus
and
telamon
with
him
as
they
came
to
the
city
a
mist
fell
and
jason
and
his
comrades
with
the
sons
of
phrixus
went
through
the
city
without
being
seen
they
came
before
the
palace
of
king
æetes
then
phrontis
and
melas
were
some
way
behind
the
mist
lifted
and
before
the
heroes
was
the
wonder
of
the
palace
in
the
bright
light
of
the
morning
vines
with
broad
leaves
and
heavy
clusters
of
fruit
grew
from
column
to
column
the
columns
holding
a
gallery
up
and
under
the
vines
were
the
four
fountains
that
hephæstus
had
made
for
king
æetes
they
gushed
out
into
golden
silver
bronze
and
iron
basins
and
one
fountain
gushed
out
clear
water
and
another
gushed
out
milk
another
gushed
out
wine
and
another
oil
on
each
side
of
the
courtyard
were
the
palace
buildings
in
one
king
æetes
lived
with
apsyrtus
his
son
and
in
the
other
chalciope
and
medea
lived
with
their
handmaidens
medea
was
passing
from
her
father
s
house
the
mist
lifted
suddenly
and
she
saw
three
strangers
in
the
palace
courtyard
one
had
a
crimson
mantle
on
his
shoulders
were
such
as
to
make
him
seem
a
man
that
a
whole
world
could
not
overthrow
and
his
eyes
had
all
the
sun
s
light
in
them
amazed
medea
stood
looking
upon
jason
wondering
at
his
bright
hair
and
gleaming
eyes
and
at
the
lightness
and
strength
of
the
hand
that
he
had
raised
and
then
a
dove
flew
toward
her
it
was
being
chased
by
a
hawk
and
medea
saw
the
hawk
s
eyes
and
beak
as
the
dove
lighted
upon
her
shoulder
she
threw
her
veil
around
it
and
the
hawk
dashed
itself
against
a
column
and
as
medea
trembling
leaned
against
the
column
she
heard
a
cry
from
her
sister
who
was
within
for
now
phrontis
and
melas
had
come
up
and
chalciope
who
was
spinning
by
the
door
saw
them
and
cried
out
all
the
servants
rushed
out
seeing
chalciope
s
sons
there
they
too
uttered
loud
cries
and
made
such
commotion
that
apsyrtus
and
then
king
æetes
came
out
of
the
palace
jason
saw
king
æetes
he
was
old
and
white
but
he
had
great
green
eyes
and
the
strength
of
a
leopard
was
in
all
he
did
and
jason
looked
upon
apsyrtus
too
the
son
of
æetes
looked
like
a
phænician
merchant
black
of
beard
and
with
rings
in
his
ears
with
a
hooked
nose
and
a
gleam
of
copper
in
his
face
phrontis
and
melas
went
from
their
mother
s
embrace
and
made
reverence
to
king
æetes
then
they
spoke
of
the
heroes
who
were
with
them
of
jason
and
his
two
comrades
æetes
bade
all
enter
the
palace
baths
were
made
ready
for
them
and
a
banquet
was
prepared
after
the
banquet
when
they
all
sat
together
æetes
addressing
the
eldest
of
chalciope
s
sons
said
sons
of
phrixus
of
that
man
whom
i
honored
above
all
men
who
came
to
my
halls
speak
now
and
tell
me
how
it
is
that
you
have
come
back
to
aea
so
soon
and
who
they
are
these
men
who
come
with
you
æetes
as
he
spoke
looked
sharply
upon
phrontis
and
melas
for
he
suspected
them
of
having
returned
to
aea
bringing
these
armed
men
with
them
with
an
evil
intent
phrontis
looked
at
the
king
and
said
æetes
our
ship
was
driven
upon
the
island
of
ares
where
it
was
almost
broken
upon
the
rocks
that
was
on
a
murky
night
and
in
the
morning
the
birds
of
ares
shot
their
sharp
feathers
upon
us
we
pulled
away
from
that
place
and
thereafter
we
were
driven
by
the
winds
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
phasis
there
we
met
with
these
heroes
who
were
friendly
to
us
who
they
are
what
they
have
come
to
your
city
for
i
shall
now
tell
you
a
certain
king
longing
to
drive
one
of
these
heroes
from
his
land
and
hoping
that
the
race
of
cretheus
might
perish
utterly
led
him
to
enter
a
most
perilous
adventure
he
came
here
upon
a
ship
that
was
made
by
the
command
of
hera
the
wife
of
zeus
a
ship
more
wonderful
than
mortals
ever
sailed
in
before
with
him
there
came
the
mightiest
of
the
heroes
of
greece
he
is
jason
the
grandson
of
cretheus
and
he
has
come
to
beg
that
you
will
grant
him
freely
the
famous
fleece
of
gold
that
phrixus
brought
to
aea
but
not
without
recompense
to
you
would
he
take
the
fleece
already
he
has
heard
of
your
bitter
foes
the
sauromatæ
he
with
his
comrades
would
subdue
them
for
you
and
if
you
would
ask
of
the
names
and
the
lineage
of
the
heroes
who
are
with
jason
i
shall
tell
you
this
is
peleus
and
this
is
telamon
they
are
brothers
and
they
are
sons
of
æacus
who
was
of
the
seed
of
zeus
and
all
the
other
heroes
who
have
come
with
them
are
of
the
seed
of
the
so
phrontis
said
but
the
king
was
not
placated
by
what
he
said
he
thought
that
the
sons
of
chalciope
had
returned
to
aea
bringing
these
warriors
with
them
so
that
they
might
wrest
the
kingship
from
him
or
failing
that
plunder
the
city
æetes
s
heart
was
filled
with
wrath
as
he
looked
upon
them
and
his
eyes
shone
as
a
leopard
s
eyes
begone
from
my
sight
he
cried
robbers
that
ye
are
tricksters
if
you
had
not
eaten
at
my
table
assuredly
i
should
have
had
your
tongues
cut
out
for
speaking
falsehoods
about
the
blessed
gods
saying
that
this
one
and
that
of
your
companions
was
of
their
divine
telamon
and
peleus
strode
forward
with
angry
hearts
they
would
have
laid
their
hands
upon
king
æetes
only
jason
held
them
back
and
then
speaking
to
the
king
in
a
quiet
voice
jason
said
bear
with
us
king
æetes
i
pray
you
we
have
not
come
with
such
evil
intent
as
you
think
ah
it
was
the
evil
command
of
an
evil
king
that
sent
me
forth
with
these
companions
of
mine
across
dangerous
gulfs
of
the
sea
and
to
face
your
wrath
and
the
armed
men
you
can
bring
against
us
we
are
ready
to
make
great
recompense
for
the
friendliness
you
may
show
to
us
we
will
subdue
for
you
the
sauromatæ
or
any
other
people
that
you
would
lord
it
but
æetes
was
not
made
friendly
by
jason
s
words
his
heart
was
divided
as
to
whether
he
should
summon
his
armed
men
and
have
them
slain
upon
the
spot
or
whether
he
should
put
them
into
danger
by
the
trial
he
would
make
of
them
at
last
he
thought
that
it
would
be
better
to
put
them
to
the
trial
that
he
had
in
mind
slaying
them
afterward
if
need
be
and
then
he
spoke
to
jason
saying
strangers
to
colchis
it
may
be
true
what
my
nephews
have
said
it
may
be
that
ye
are
truly
of
the
seed
of
the
immortals
and
it
may
be
that
i
shall
give
you
the
golden
fleece
to
bear
away
after
i
have
made
trial
of
as
he
spoke
medea
brought
there
by
his
messenger
so
that
she
might
observe
the
strangers
came
into
the
chamber
she
entered
softly
and
she
stood
away
from
her
father
and
the
four
who
were
speaking
with
him
jason
looked
upon
her
and
even
although
his
mind
was
filled
with
the
thought
of
bending
king
æetes
to
his
will
he
saw
what
manner
of
maiden
she
was
and
what
beauty
and
what
strength
was
hers
she
had
a
dark
face
that
was
made
very
strange
by
her
crown
of
golden
hair
her
eyes
like
her
father
s
were
wide
and
full
of
light
and
her
lips
were
so
full
and
red
that
they
made
her
mouth
like
an
opening
rose
but
her
brows
were
always
knit
as
if
there
was
some
secret
anger
within
her
with
brave
men
i
have
no
quarrel
said
æetes
i
will
make
a
trial
of
your
bravery
and
if
your
bravery
wins
through
the
trial
be
very
sure
that
you
will
have
the
golden
fleece
to
bring
back
in
triumph
to
iolcus
but
the
trial
that
i
would
make
of
you
is
hard
for
a
great
hero
even
know
that
on
the
plain
of
ares
yonder
i
have
two
bulls
with
feet
of
brass
these
bulls
were
once
conquered
by
me
i
yoked
them
to
a
plow
of
adamant
and
with
them
i
plowed
the
field
of
ares
for
four
then
i
sowed
the
furrows
not
with
the
seed
that
demeter
gives
but
with
teeth
of
a
dragon
and
from
the
dragon
s
teeth
that
i
sowed
in
the
field
of
ares
armed
men
sprang
up
i
slew
them
with
my
spear
as
they
rose
around
me
to
slay
me
if
you
can
accomplish
this
that
i
accomplished
in
days
gone
by
i
shall
submit
to
you
and
give
you
the
golden
fleece
but
if
you
can
not
accomplish
what
i
once
accomplished
you
shall
go
from
my
city
for
it
is
not
right
that
a
brave
man
should
yield
aught
to
one
who
can
not
show
himself
as
so
æetes
said
then
jason
utterly
confounded
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
he
raised
them
to
speak
to
the
king
and
as
he
did
he
found
the
strange
eyes
of
medea
upon
him
with
all
the
courage
that
was
in
him
he
spoke
i
will
dare
this
contest
monstrous
as
it
is
i
will
face
this
doom
i
have
come
far
and
there
is
nothing
else
for
me
to
do
but
to
yoke
your
bulls
to
the
plow
of
adamant
and
plow
the
furrows
in
the
field
of
ares
and
struggle
with
the
as
he
said
this
he
saw
the
eyes
of
medea
grow
wide
as
with
fear
then
æetes
said
go
back
to
your
ship
and
make
ready
for
the
jason
with
peleus
and
telamon
left
the
chamber
and
the
king
smiled
grimly
as
he
saw
them
go
phrontis
and
melas
went
to
where
their
mother
was
but
medea
stayed
and
æetes
looked
upon
her
with
his
great
leopard
s
eyes
my
daughter
my
wise
medea
he
said
go
put
spells
upon
the
moon
that
hecate
may
weaken
that
man
in
his
hour
of
medea
turned
away
from
her
father
s
eyes
and
went
to
her
chamber
ii
medea
the
sorceress
decorative
first
letter
turned
away
from
her
father
s
eyes
and
she
went
into
her
own
chamber
for
a
long
time
she
stood
there
with
her
hands
clasped
together
she
heard
the
voice
of
chalciope
lamenting
because
æetes
had
taken
a
hatred
to
her
sons
and
might
strive
to
destroy
them
she
heard
the
voice
of
her
sister
lamenting
but
medea
thought
that
the
cause
that
her
sister
had
for
grieving
was
small
compared
with
the
cause
that
she
herself
had
she
thought
on
the
moment
when
she
had
seen
jason
for
the
first
the
courtyard
as
the
mist
lifted
and
the
dove
flew
to
her
she
thought
of
him
as
he
lifted
those
bright
eyes
of
his
then
she
thought
of
his
voice
as
he
spoke
after
her
father
had
imposed
the
dreadful
trial
upon
him
she
would
have
liked
then
to
have
cried
out
to
him
o
youth
if
others
rejoice
at
the
doom
that
you
go
to
i
do
not
still
her
sister
lamented
but
how
great
was
her
own
grief
compared
to
her
sister
s
for
chalciope
could
try
to
help
her
sons
and
could
lament
for
the
danger
they
were
in
and
no
one
would
blame
her
but
she
might
not
strive
to
help
jason
nor
might
she
lament
for
the
danger
he
was
in
how
terrible
it
would
be
for
a
maiden
to
help
a
stranger
against
her
father
s
design
how
terrible
it
would
be
for
a
woman
of
colchis
to
help
a
stranger
against
the
will
of
the
king
how
terrible
it
would
be
for
a
daughter
to
plot
against
king
æetes
in
his
own
palace
and
then
medea
hated
aea
her
city
she
hated
the
furious
people
who
came
together
in
the
assembly
and
she
hated
the
brazen
bulls
that
hephæstus
had
given
her
father
and
then
she
thought
that
there
was
nothing
in
aea
except
the
furious
people
and
the
bulls
o
how
pitiful
it
was
that
the
strange
hero
and
his
friends
should
have
come
to
such
a
place
for
the
sake
of
the
golden
fleece
that
was
watched
over
by
the
sleepless
serpent
in
the
grove
of
ares
still
chalciope
lamented
would
chalciope
come
to
her
and
ask
her
medea
to
help
her
sons
if
she
should
come
she
might
speak
of
the
strangers
too
and
of
the
danger
they
were
in
medea
went
to
her
couch
and
lay
down
upon
it
she
longed
for
her
sister
to
come
to
her
or
to
call
to
her
but
chalciope
stayed
in
her
own
chamber
medea
lying
upon
her
couch
listened
to
her
sister
s
laments
at
last
she
went
near
where
chalciope
was
then
shame
that
she
should
think
so
much
about
the
stranger
came
over
her
she
stood
there
without
moving
she
turned
to
go
back
to
the
couch
and
then
trembled
so
much
that
she
could
not
stir
as
she
stood
between
her
couch
and
her
sister
s
chamber
she
heard
the
voice
of
chalciope
calling
to
her
she
went
into
the
chamber
where
her
sister
stood
chalciope
flung
her
arms
around
her
swear
said
she
to
medea
swear
by
hecate
the
moon
that
you
will
never
speak
of
something
i
am
going
to
ask
medea
swore
that
she
would
never
speak
of
it
chalciope
spoke
of
the
danger
her
sons
were
in
she
asked
medea
to
devise
a
way
by
which
they
could
escape
with
the
stranger
from
aea
in
aea
and
in
colchis
she
said
there
will
be
no
safety
for
my
sons
and
to
save
phrontis
and
melas
she
said
medea
would
have
to
save
the
strangers
also
surely
she
knew
of
a
charm
that
would
save
the
stranger
from
the
brazen
bulls
in
the
contest
on
the
morrow
so
chalciope
came
to
the
very
thing
that
was
in
medea
s
mind
her
heart
bounded
with
joy
and
she
embraced
her
chalciope
she
said
i
declare
that
i
am
your
sister
and
your
daughter
too
for
did
you
not
care
for
me
when
i
was
an
infant
i
will
strive
to
save
your
sons
i
will
strive
to
save
the
strangers
who
came
with
your
sons
send
one
to
the
him
to
the
leader
of
the
strangers
and
tell
him
that
i
would
see
him
at
daybreak
in
the
temple
of
when
medea
said
this
chalciope
embraced
her
again
she
was
amazed
to
see
how
medea
s
tears
were
flowing
chalciope
she
said
no
one
will
know
the
dangers
that
i
shall
go
through
to
save
swiftly
then
chalciope
went
from
the
chamber
but
medea
stayed
there
with
her
head
bowed
and
the
blush
of
shame
on
her
face
she
thought
that
already
she
had
deceived
her
sister
making
her
think
that
it
was
phrontis
and
melas
and
not
jason
that
was
in
her
mind
to
save
and
she
thought
on
how
she
would
have
to
plot
against
her
father
and
against
her
own
people
and
all
for
the
sake
of
a
stranger
who
would
sail
away
without
thought
of
her
without
the
image
of
her
in
his
mind
jason
with
peleus
and
telamon
went
back
to
the
his
comrades
asked
how
he
had
fared
and
when
he
spoke
to
them
of
the
bulls
with
feet
of
brass
of
the
dragon
s
teeth
that
had
to
be
sown
and
of
the
men
that
had
to
be
overcome
the
argonauts
were
greatly
cast
down
for
this
task
they
thought
was
one
that
could
not
be
accomplished
he
who
stood
before
the
bulls
would
perish
on
the
moment
but
they
knew
that
one
amongst
them
must
strive
to
accomplish
the
task
and
if
jason
held
back
peleus
telamon
theseus
castor
polydeuces
or
any
one
of
the
others
would
undertake
it
but
jason
would
not
hold
back
on
the
morrow
he
said
he
would
strive
to
yoke
the
bulls
to
the
plow
of
adamant
if
he
perished
the
argonauts
should
then
do
what
they
thought
was
other
trials
to
gain
the
golden
fleece
or
turn
their
ship
and
sail
back
to
greece
while
they
were
speaking
phrontis
chalciope
s
son
came
to
the
ship
the
argonauts
welcomed
him
and
in
a
while
he
began
to
speak
of
his
mother
s
sister
and
of
the
help
she
could
give
they
grew
eager
as
he
spoke
of
her
all
except
rough
arcas
who
stood
wrapped
in
his
bear
s
skin
shame
on
us
rough
arcas
cried
shame
on
us
if
we
have
come
here
to
crave
the
help
of
girls
speak
no
more
of
this
let
us
the
argonauts
go
with
swords
into
the
city
of
aea
and
slay
this
king
and
carry
off
the
fleece
of
some
of
the
argonauts
murmured
approval
of
what
arcas
said
but
orpheus
silenced
him
and
them
for
in
his
prophetic
mind
orpheus
saw
something
of
the
help
that
medea
would
give
them
it
would
be
well
orpheus
said
to
take
help
from
this
wise
maiden
jason
should
go
to
her
in
the
temple
of
hecate
the
argonauts
agreed
to
this
they
listened
to
what
phrontis
told
them
about
the
brazen
bulls
and
the
night
wore
on
when
darkness
came
upon
the
earth
when
at
sea
sailors
looked
to
the
bear
and
the
stars
of
orion
when
in
the
city
there
was
no
longer
the
sound
of
barking
dogs
nor
of
men
s
voices
medea
went
from
the
palace
she
came
to
a
path
she
followed
it
until
it
brought
her
into
the
part
of
the
grove
that
was
all
black
with
the
shadow
that
oak
trees
made
she
raised
up
her
hands
and
she
called
upon
hecate
the
moon
as
she
did
there
was
a
blaze
as
from
torches
all
around
and
she
saw
horrible
serpents
stretching
themselves
toward
her
from
the
branches
of
the
trees
medea
shrank
back
in
fear
but
again
she
called
upon
hecate
and
now
there
was
a
howling
as
from
the
hounds
of
hades
all
around
her
fearful
indeed
medea
grew
as
the
howling
came
near
her
almost
she
turned
to
flee
but
she
raised
her
hands
again
and
called
upon
hecate
then
the
nymphs
who
haunted
the
marsh
and
the
river
shrieked
and
at
those
shrieks
medea
crouched
down
in
fear
she
called
upon
hecate
the
moon
again
she
saw
the
moon
rise
above
the
treetops
and
then
the
hissing
and
shrieking
and
howling
died
away
holding
up
a
goblet
in
her
hand
medea
poured
out
a
libation
of
honey
to
hecate
the
moon
and
then
she
went
to
where
the
moon
made
a
brightness
upon
the
ground
there
she
saw
a
flower
that
rose
above
the
other
flower
that
grew
from
two
joined
stalks
and
that
was
of
the
color
of
a
crocus
medea
cut
the
stalks
with
a
brazen
knife
and
as
she
did
there
came
a
deep
groan
out
of
the
earth
this
was
the
promethean
flower
it
had
come
out
of
the
earth
first
when
the
vulture
that
tore
at
prometheus
s
liver
had
let
fall
to
earth
a
drop
of
his
blood
with
a
caspian
shell
that
she
had
brought
with
her
medea
gathered
the
dark
juice
of
this
juice
that
went
to
make
her
most
potent
charm
all
night
she
went
through
the
grove
gathering
the
juice
of
secret
herbs
then
she
mingled
them
in
a
phial
that
she
put
away
in
her
girdle
she
went
from
that
grove
and
along
the
river
when
the
sun
shed
its
first
rays
upon
snowy
caucasus
she
stood
outside
the
temple
of
hecate
she
waited
but
she
had
not
long
to
wait
for
like
the
bright
star
sirius
rising
out
of
ocean
soon
she
saw
jason
coming
toward
her
she
made
a
sign
to
him
and
he
came
and
stood
beside
her
in
the
portals
of
the
temple
they
would
have
stood
face
to
face
if
medea
did
not
have
her
head
bent
a
blush
had
come
upon
her
face
and
jason
seeing
it
and
seeing
how
her
head
was
bent
knew
how
grievous
it
was
to
her
to
meet
and
speak
to
a
stranger
in
this
way
he
took
her
hand
and
he
spoke
to
her
reverently
as
one
would
speak
to
a
priestess
lady
he
said
i
implore
you
by
hecate
and
by
zeus
who
helps
all
strangers
and
suppliants
to
be
kind
to
me
and
to
the
men
who
have
come
to
your
country
with
me
without
your
help
i
can
not
hope
to
prevail
in
the
grievous
trial
that
has
been
laid
upon
me
if
you
will
help
us
medea
your
name
will
be
renowned
throughout
all
greece
and
i
have
hopes
that
you
will
help
us
for
your
face
and
form
show
you
to
be
one
who
can
be
kind
and
the
blush
of
shame
had
gone
from
medea
s
face
and
a
softer
blush
came
over
her
as
jason
spoke
she
looked
upon
him
and
she
knew
that
she
could
hardly
live
if
the
breath
of
the
brazen
bulls
withered
his
life
or
if
the
men
slew
him
she
took
the
charm
from
out
her
girdle
ungrudgingly
she
put
it
into
jason
s
hands
and
as
she
gave
him
the
charm
that
she
had
gained
with
such
danger
the
fear
and
trouble
that
was
around
her
heart
melted
as
the
dew
melts
from
around
the
rose
when
it
is
warmed
by
the
first
light
of
the
morning
then
they
spoke
standing
close
together
in
the
portal
of
the
temple
she
told
him
how
he
should
anoint
his
body
all
over
with
the
charm
it
would
give
him
she
said
boundless
and
untiring
strength
and
make
him
so
that
the
breath
of
the
bulls
could
not
wither
him
nor
the
horns
of
the
bulls
pierce
him
she
told
him
also
to
sprinkle
his
shield
and
his
sword
with
the
charm
and
then
they
spoke
of
the
dragon
s
teeth
and
of
the
men
who
would
spring
from
them
medea
told
jason
that
when
they
arose
out
of
the
earth
he
was
to
cast
a
great
stone
amongst
them
the
men
would
struggle
about
the
stone
and
they
would
slay
each
other
in
the
contest
her
dark
and
delicate
face
was
beautiful
jason
looked
upon
her
and
it
came
into
his
mind
that
in
colchis
there
was
something
else
of
worth
besides
the
golden
fleece
and
he
thought
that
after
he
had
won
the
fleece
there
would
be
peace
between
the
argonauts
and
king
æetes
and
that
he
and
medea
might
sit
together
in
the
king
s
hall
but
when
he
spoke
of
being
joined
in
friendship
with
her
father
medea
cried
think
not
of
treaties
nor
of
covenants
in
greece
such
are
regarded
but
not
here
ah
do
not
think
that
the
king
my
father
will
keep
any
peace
with
you
when
you
have
won
the
fleece
you
must
hasten
away
you
must
not
tarry
in
she
said
this
and
her
cheeks
were
wet
with
tears
to
think
that
he
should
go
so
soon
that
he
would
go
so
far
and
that
she
would
never
look
upon
him
again
she
bent
her
head
again
and
she
said
tell
me
about
your
own
land
about
the
place
of
your
father
the
place
where
you
will
live
when
you
win
back
from
then
jason
told
her
of
iolcus
he
told
her
how
it
was
circled
by
mountains
not
so
lofty
as
her
caucasus
he
told
her
of
the
pasture
lands
of
iolcus
with
their
flocks
of
sheep
he
told
her
of
the
mountain
pelion
where
he
had
been
reared
by
chiron
the
ancient
centaur
he
told
her
of
his
father
who
lingered
out
his
life
in
waiting
for
his
return
medea
said
when
you
go
back
to
iolcus
do
not
forget
me
medea
i
shall
remember
you
jason
even
in
my
father
s
despite
and
it
will
be
my
hope
that
some
rumor
of
you
will
come
to
me
like
some
if
you
forget
me
may
some
blast
of
wind
sweep
me
away
to
iolcus
and
may
i
sit
in
your
hall
an
unknown
and
an
unexpected
guest
then
they
parted
medea
went
swiftly
back
to
the
palace
and
jason
turning
to
the
river
went
to
where
the
was
moored
the
heroes
embraced
and
questioned
him
he
told
them
of
medea
s
counsel
and
he
showed
them
the
charm
she
had
given
him
that
savage
man
arcas
scoffed
at
medea
s
counsel
and
medea
s
charm
saying
that
the
argonauts
had
become
indeed
when
they
had
to
depend
upon
a
girl
s
help
jason
bathed
in
the
river
then
he
anointed
himself
with
the
charm
he
sprinkled
his
spear
and
shield
and
sword
with
it
he
came
to
arcas
who
sat
upon
his
bench
still
nursing
his
anger
and
he
held
the
spear
toward
him
arcas
took
up
his
heavy
sword
and
he
hewed
at
the
butt
of
the
spear
the
edge
of
the
sword
turned
the
blade
leaped
back
in
his
hand
as
if
it
had
been
struck
against
an
anvil
and
jason
feeling
within
him
a
boundless
and
tireless
strength
laughed
aloud
iii
the
winning
of
the
golden
fleece
decorative
first
letter
took
the
ship
out
of
the
backwater
and
they
brought
her
to
a
wharf
in
the
city
at
a
place
that
was
called
the
ram
s
couch
they
fastened
the
then
they
marched
to
the
field
of
ares
where
the
king
and
the
colchian
people
were
jason
carrying
his
shield
and
spear
went
before
the
king
from
the
king
s
hand
he
took
the
gleaming
helmet
that
held
the
dragon
s
teeth
this
he
put
into
the
hands
of
theseus
who
went
with
him
then
with
the
spear
and
shield
in
his
hands
with
his
sword
girt
across
his
shoulders
and
with
his
mantle
stripped
off
jason
looked
across
the
field
of
ares
he
saw
the
plow
that
he
was
to
yoke
to
the
bulls
he
saw
the
yoke
of
bronze
near
it
he
saw
the
tracks
of
the
bulls
hooves
he
followed
the
tracks
until
he
came
to
the
lair
of
the
bulls
out
of
that
lair
which
was
underground
smoke
and
fire
belched
he
set
his
feet
firmly
upon
the
ground
and
he
held
his
shield
before
him
he
awaited
the
onset
of
the
bulls
they
came
clanging
up
with
loud
bellowing
breathing
out
fire
they
lowered
their
heads
and
with
mighty
horns
they
came
to
gore
and
trample
him
medea
s
charm
had
made
him
strong
medea
s
charm
had
made
his
shield
impregnable
the
rush
of
the
bulls
did
not
overthrow
him
his
comrades
shouted
to
see
him
standing
firmly
there
and
in
wonder
the
colchians
gazed
upon
him
all
round
him
as
from
a
furnace
there
came
smoke
and
fire
the
bulls
roared
mightily
grasping
the
horns
of
the
bull
that
was
upon
his
right
hand
jason
dragged
him
until
he
had
brought
him
beside
the
yoke
of
bronze
striking
the
brazen
knees
of
the
bull
suddenly
with
his
foot
he
forced
him
down
then
he
smote
the
other
bull
as
it
rushed
upon
him
and
it
too
he
forced
down
upon
its
knees
castor
and
polydeuces
held
the
yoke
to
him
jason
bound
it
upon
the
necks
of
the
bulls
he
fastened
the
plow
to
the
yoke
then
he
took
his
shield
and
set
it
upon
his
back
and
grasping
the
handles
of
the
plow
he
started
to
make
the
furrow
with
his
long
spear
he
drove
the
bulls
before
him
as
with
a
goad
terribly
they
raged
furiously
they
breathed
out
fire
beside
jason
theseus
went
holding
the
helmet
that
held
the
dragon
s
teeth
the
hard
ground
was
torn
up
by
the
plow
of
adamant
and
the
clods
groaned
as
they
were
cast
up
jason
flung
the
teeth
between
the
open
sods
often
turning
his
head
in
fear
that
the
deadly
crop
of
the
men
were
rising
behind
him
illustration
the
field
of
the
dragon
s
teeth
by
the
time
that
a
third
of
the
day
was
finished
the
field
of
ares
had
been
plowed
and
sown
as
yet
the
furrows
were
free
of
the
men
jason
went
down
to
the
river
and
filled
his
helmet
full
of
water
and
drank
deeply
and
his
knees
that
were
stiffened
with
the
plowing
he
bent
until
they
were
made
supple
again
he
saw
the
field
rising
into
mounds
it
seemed
that
there
were
graves
all
over
the
field
of
ares
then
he
saw
spears
and
shields
and
helmets
rising
up
out
of
the
earth
then
armed
warriors
sprang
up
a
fierce
battle
cry
upon
their
lips
jason
remembered
the
counsel
of
medea
he
raised
a
boulder
that
four
men
could
hardly
raise
and
with
arms
hardened
by
the
plowing
he
cast
it
the
colchians
shouted
to
see
such
a
stone
cast
by
the
hands
of
one
man
right
into
the
middle
of
the
men
the
stone
came
they
leaped
upon
it
like
hounds
striking
at
one
another
as
they
came
together
shield
crashed
on
shield
spear
rang
upon
spear
as
they
struck
at
each
other
the
men
as
fast
as
they
arose
went
down
before
the
weapons
in
the
hands
of
their
brethren
jason
rushed
upon
them
his
sword
in
his
hand
he
slew
some
that
had
risen
out
of
the
earth
only
as
far
as
the
shoulders
he
slew
others
whose
feet
were
still
in
the
earth
he
slew
others
who
were
ready
to
spring
upon
him
soon
all
the
men
were
slain
and
the
furrows
ran
with
their
dark
blood
as
channels
run
with
water
in
springtime
the
argonauts
shouted
loudly
for
jason
s
victory
king
æetes
rose
from
his
seat
that
was
beside
the
river
and
he
went
back
to
the
city
the
colchians
followed
him
day
faded
and
jason
s
contest
was
ended
but
it
was
not
the
will
of
æetes
that
the
strangers
should
be
let
depart
peaceably
with
the
golden
fleece
that
jason
had
won
in
the
assembly
place
with
his
son
apsyrtus
beside
him
and
with
the
furious
colchians
all
around
him
the
king
stood
on
his
breast
was
the
gleaming
corselet
that
ares
had
given
him
and
on
his
head
was
that
golden
helmet
with
its
four
plumes
that
made
him
look
as
if
he
were
truly
the
son
of
helios
the
sun
lightnings
flashed
from
his
great
eyes
he
spoke
fiercely
to
the
colchians
holding
in
his
hand
his
spear
he
would
have
them
attack
the
strangers
and
burn
the
he
would
have
the
sons
of
phrixus
slain
for
bringing
them
to
aea
there
was
a
prophecy
he
declared
that
would
have
him
be
watchful
of
the
treachery
of
his
own
offspring
this
prophecy
was
being
fulfilled
by
the
children
of
chalciope
he
feared
too
that
his
daughter
medea
had
aided
the
strangers
so
the
king
spoke
and
the
colchians
hating
all
strangers
shouted
around
him
word
of
what
her
father
had
said
was
brought
to
medea
she
knew
that
she
would
have
to
go
to
the
argonauts
and
bid
them
flee
hastily
from
aea
they
would
not
go
she
knew
without
the
golden
fleece
then
she
medea
would
have
to
show
them
how
to
gain
the
fleece
then
she
could
never
again
go
back
to
her
father
s
palace
she
could
never
again
sit
in
this
chamber
and
talk
to
her
handmaidens
and
be
with
chalciope
her
sister
forever
afterward
she
would
be
dependent
on
the
kindness
of
strangers
medea
wept
when
she
thought
of
all
this
and
then
she
cut
off
a
tress
of
her
hair
and
she
left
it
in
her
chamber
as
a
farewell
from
one
who
was
going
afar
into
the
chamber
where
chalciope
was
she
whispered
farewell
the
palace
doors
were
all
heavily
bolted
but
medea
did
not
have
to
pull
back
the
bolts
as
she
chanted
her
magic
song
the
bolts
softly
drew
back
the
doors
softly
opened
swiftly
she
went
along
the
ways
that
led
to
the
river
she
came
to
where
fires
were
blazing
and
she
knew
that
the
argonauts
were
there
she
called
to
them
and
phrontis
chalciope
s
son
heard
the
cry
and
knew
the
voice
to
jason
he
spoke
and
jason
quickly
went
to
where
medea
stood
she
clasped
jason
s
hand
and
she
drew
him
with
her
the
golden
fleece
she
said
the
time
has
come
when
you
must
pluck
the
golden
fleece
off
the
oak
in
the
grove
of
when
she
said
these
words
all
jason
s
being
became
taut
like
the
string
of
a
bow
it
was
then
the
hour
when
huntsmen
cast
sleep
from
their
who
never
sleep
away
the
end
of
the
night
but
who
are
ever
ready
to
be
up
and
away
with
their
hounds
before
the
beams
of
the
sun
efface
the
track
and
the
scent
of
the
quarry
along
a
path
that
went
from
the
river
medea
drew
jason
they
entered
a
grove
then
jason
saw
something
that
was
like
a
cloud
filled
with
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
it
hung
from
a
great
oak
tree
in
awe
he
stood
and
looked
upon
it
knowing
that
at
last
he
looked
upon
the
golden
fleece
his
hand
let
slip
medea
s
hand
and
he
went
to
seize
the
fleece
as
he
did
he
heard
a
dreadful
hiss
and
then
he
saw
the
guardian
of
the
golden
fleece
coiled
all
around
the
tree
with
outstretched
neck
and
keen
and
sleepless
eyes
was
a
deadly
serpent
its
hiss
ran
all
through
the
grove
and
the
birds
that
were
wakening
up
squawked
in
terror
like
rings
of
smoke
that
rise
one
above
the
other
the
coils
of
the
serpent
went
around
the
covered
by
hard
and
gleaming
scales
it
uncoiled
stretched
itself
and
lifted
its
head
to
strike
then
medea
dropped
on
her
knees
before
it
and
began
to
chant
her
magic
song
as
she
sang
the
coils
around
the
tree
grew
slack
like
a
dark
noiseless
wave
the
serpent
sank
down
on
the
ground
but
still
its
jaws
were
open
and
those
dreadful
jaws
threatened
jason
medea
with
a
newly
cut
spray
of
juniper
dipped
in
a
mystic
brew
touched
its
deadly
eyes
and
still
she
chanted
her
magic
song
the
serpent
s
jaws
closed
its
eyes
became
deadened
far
through
the
grove
its
length
was
stretched
out
illustration
then
jason
took
the
golden
fleece
as
he
raised
his
hands
to
it
its
brightness
was
such
as
to
make
a
flame
on
his
face
medea
called
to
him
he
strove
to
gather
it
all
up
in
his
arms
medea
was
beside
him
and
they
went
swiftly
on
they
came
to
the
river
and
down
to
the
place
where
the
was
moored
the
heroes
who
were
aboard
started
up
astonished
to
see
the
fleece
that
shone
as
with
the
lightning
of
zeus
over
medea
jason
cast
it
and
he
lifted
her
aboard
the
o
friends
he
cried
the
quest
on
which
we
dared
the
gulfs
of
the
sea
and
the
wrath
of
kings
is
accomplished
thanks
to
the
help
of
this
maiden
now
may
we
return
to
greece
now
have
we
the
hope
of
looking
upon
our
fathers
and
our
friends
once
more
and
in
all
honor
will
we
bring
this
maiden
with
us
medea
the
daughter
of
king
then
he
drew
his
sword
and
cut
the
hawsers
of
the
ship
calling
upon
the
heroes
to
drive
the
on
there
was
a
din
and
a
strain
and
a
splash
of
oars
and
away
from
aea
the
dashed
beside
the
mast
medea
stood
the
golden
fleece
had
fallen
at
her
feet
and
her
head
and
face
were
covered
by
her
silver
veil
iv
the
slaying
of
apsyrtus
decorative
first
letter

was
to
be
splashed
with
a

for
a
long
time
to
be
held
back
from
a
return
to
their
native
land
now
as
they
went
down
the
river
they
saw
that
dangers
were
coming
swiftly
upon
them
the
chariots
of
the
colchians
were
upon
the
banks
jason
saw
king
æetes
in
his
chariot
a
blazing
torch
lighting
his
corselet
and
his
helmet
swiftly
the
went
but
there
were
ships
behind
her
and
they
went
swiftly
too
they
came
into
the
sea
of
pontus
and
phrontis
the
son
of
phrixus
gave
counsel
to
them
do
not
strive
to
make
the
passage
of
the
symplegades
he
said
all
who
live
around
the
sea
of
pontus
are
friendly
to
king
æetes
they
will
be
warned
by
him
and
they
will
be
ready
to
slay
us
and
take
the
let
us
journey
up
the
river
ister
and
by
that
way
we
can
come
to
the
thrinacian
sea
that
is
close
to
your
the
argonauts
thought
well
of
what
phrontis
said
into
the
waters
of
the
ister
the
ship
was
brought
many
of
the
colchian
ships
passed
by
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
went
seeking
the
toward
the
passage
of
the
symplegades
but
the
argonauts
were
on
a
way
that
was
dangerous
for
them
for
apsyrtus
had
not
gone
toward
the
symplegades
seeking
the
he
had
led
his
soldiers
overland
to
the
river
ister
at
a
place
that
was
at
a
distance
above
its
mouth
there
were
islands
in
the
river
at
that
place
and
the
soldiers
of
apsyrtus
landed
on
the
islands
while
apsyrtus
went
to
the
kings
of
the
people
around
and
claimed
their
support
the
came
and
the
heroes
found
themselves
cut
off
they
could
not
make
their
way
between
the
islands
that
were
filled
with
the
colchian
soldiers
nor
along
the
banks
that
were
lined
with
men
friendly
to
king
æetes
was
stayed
apsyrtus
sent
for
the
chiefs
he
had
men
enough
to
overwhelm
them
but
he
shrank
from
a
fight
with
the
heroes
and
he
thought
that
he
might
gain
all
he
wanted
from
them
without
a
struggle
theseus
and
peleus
went
to
him
apsyrtus
would
have
them
give
up
the
golden
fleece
he
would
have
them
give
up
medea
and
the
sons
of
phrixus
also
theseus
and
peleus
appealed
to
the
judgment
of
the
kings
who
supported
apsyrtus
æetes
they
said
had
no
more
claim
on
the
golden
fleece
he
had
promised
it
to
jason
as
a
reward
for
tasks
that
he
had
imposed
the
tasks
had
been
accomplished
and
the
fleece
no
matter
in
what
way
it
was
taken
from
the
grove
of
ares
was
theirs
so
theseus
and
peleus
said
and
the
kings
who
supported
apsyrtus
gave
judgment
for
the
argonauts
but
medea
would
have
to
be
given
to
her
brother
if
that
were
done
the
would
be
let
go
on
her
course
apsyrtus
said
and
the
golden
fleece
would
be
left
with
them
apsyrtus
said
too
that
he
would
not
take
medea
back
to
the
wrath
of
her
father
if
the
argonauts
gave
her
up
she
would
be
let
stay
on
the
island
of
artemis
and
under
the
guardianship
of
the
goddess
the
chiefs
brought
apsyrtus
s
words
back
there
was
a
council
of
the
argonauts
and
they
agreed
that
they
should
leave
medea
on
the
island
of
artemis
but
grief
and
wrath
took
hold
of
medea
when
she
heard
of
this
resolve
almost
she
would
burn
the
she
went
to
where
jason
stood
and
she
spoke
again
of
all
she
had
done
to
save
his
life
and
win
the
golden
fleece
for
the
argonauts
jason
made
her
look
on
the
ships
and
the
soldiers
that
were
around
them
he
showed
her
how
these
could
overwhelm
the
argonauts
and
slay
them
all
with
all
the
heroes
slain
he
said
medea
would
come
into
the
hands
of
apsyrtus
who
then
could
leave
her
on
the
island
of
artemis
or
take
her
back
to
the
wrath
of
her
father
but
medea
would
not
consent
to
go
nor
could
jason
s
heart
consent
to
let
her
go
then
these
two
made
a
plot
to
deceive
apsyrtus
i
have
not
been
of
the
council
that
agreed
to
give
you
up
to
him
jason
said
after
you
have
been
left
there
i
will
take
you
off
the
island
of
artemis
secretly
the
colchians
and
the
kings
who
support
them
not
knowing
that
you
have
been
taken
off
and
hidden
on
the
will
let
us
this
medea
and
jason
planned
to
do
and
it
was
an
ill
thing
for
it
was
breaking
the
covenant
that
the
chiefs
had
entered
with
apsyrtus
illustration
medea
then
was
left
by
the
argonauts
on
the
island
of
artemis
now
apsyrtus
had
been
commanded
by
his
father
to
bring
her
back
to
aea
he
thought
that
when
she
had
been
left
by
the
argonauts
he
could
force
her
to
come
with
him
so
he
went
over
to
the
island
jason
secretly
leaving
his
companions
went
to
the
island
from
the
other
side
before
the
temple
of
artemis
jason
and
apsyrtus
came
face
to
face
both
men
thinking
they
had
been
betrayed
to
their
deaths
drew
their
swords
then
before
the
vestibule
of
the
temple
and
under
the
eyes
of
medea
jason
and
apsyrtus
fought
jason
s
sword
pierced
the
son
of
æetes
as
he
fell
apsyrtus
cried
out
bitter
words
against
medea
saying
that
it
was
on
her
account
that
he
had
come
on
his
death
and
as
he
fell

blood

her
brother

jason
lifted
medea
up
and
carried
her
to
the
they
hid
the
maiden
under
the
fleece
of
gold
and
they
sailed
past
the
ships
of
the
colchians
when
darkness
came
they
were
far
from
the
island
of
artemis
it
was
then
that
they
heard
a
loud
wailing
and
they
knew
that
the
colchians
had
discovered
that
their
prince
had
been
slain
the
colchians
did
not
pursue
them
fearing
the
wrath
of
æetes
they
made
settlements
in
the
lands
of
the
kings
who
had
supported
apsyrtus

never
went

had
come

hemmed
them

the
argonauts
as
they
sailed
on
were
not
content
covenants
had
been
broken
and
blood
had
been
shed
in
a
bad
cause
and
as
they
went
on
through
the
darkness
the
voice
of
the
ship

heard
at
the
sound

voice
fear
and
sorrow

it

a
prophecy
of
doom
castor
and
polydeuces
went
to
the
front
of
the
ship
holding
up
their
hands
they
prayed
then
they
heard
the
words
that
the
voice
uttered
in
the
night
as
they
went
on
the
voice
proclaimed
the
wrath
of
zeus
on
account
of
the
slaying
of
apsyrtus
what
was
their
doom

was
that

have
to

forever
over
the
gulfs

a

a
strange
haze
covered
everything
as
with
a
veil
as
the
argonauts
came
near
they
saw
what
looked
to
them
like
great
dragonflies
they
came
down
to
the
shore
and
then
the
heroes
saw
that
they
were
maidens
in
gleaming
dresses
the
maidens
waved
their

to

around

then
as

argonauts
looked
upon

they
saw
that
these
were
not
beasts
of
the
wild
there
was
something
strange
and
fearful
about

the
heroes
gazed
upon
them
with
troubled
eyes
they
brought
the
ship
near
but
they
stayed
upon
their
benches
holding
the
oars
in
their
hands
medea
sprang
to

spoke
to

so
that

seated
themselves
at

at

threads

turned
to

looked

just
before
they
came
the

dripped
with

told

by

to
ask
of
circe

burnt

in

all
the
while
she
prayed
to

to
be
gentle
with

she
washed

pleaded
with

to
tell
her
of

foresaw
for

circe
would
not

she
told
medea
that
one
day
she
would
meet
a
woman

knew
nothing
about

who
had
much
human
wisdom

what

fain
gone
upon

to
rest
there
away
from

oars
and
the
sound
of

the
wisest
of

looking
upon

beasts

were

far
off

jason

came
aboard

with
heavy

they
turned
to

open

they
such
high
hearts
as
when
they
drove
the
between
the
clashers
and
into

now
their
heads
drooped
as
they
went
on
and
they
sang
such
songs
as
slaves
sing
in
their
hopeless
labor
orpheus
grew
fearful
for

now

where
the
sirens
were

had
been
nymphs
and
had
tended
persephone
before
she
was
carried
off
by
aidoneus
to
be
his
queen
in
the
underworld
kind
they
had
been
but
now
they
were
changed
and
they
cared
only
for
the
destruction
of
men
all
set
around
with
rocks
was
the
island
where
they
were
as
the
came
near
the
sirens
ever
on
the
watch
to
draw
mariners
to
their
destruction
saw
them
and
came
to
the
rocks
and
sang
to
them
holding
each
other
s
hands
they
sang
all
together
their
lulling
song
that
song
made
the
wearied
voyagers
long
to
let
their
oars
go
with
the
waves
and
drift
drift
to
where
the
sirens
were
bending
down
to
them
the
sirens
with
soft
hands
and
white
arms
would
lift
them
to
soft
resting
places
then
each
of
the
sirens
sang
a
clear
piercing
song
that
called
to
each
of
the
voyagers
each
man
thought
that
his
own
name
was
in
that
song
o
how
well
it
is
that
you
have
come
near
each
one
sang
how
well
it
is
that
you
have
come
near
where
i
have
awaited
you
having
all
delight
prepared
for
you
orpheus
took
up
his
lyre
as
the
sirens
began
to
sing
he
sang
to
the
heroes
of
their
own
toils
he
sang
of
them
how
gaunt
and
weary
as
they
were
they
were
yet
men
men
who
were
the
strength
of
greece
men
who
had
been
fostered
by
the
love
and
hope
of
their
country
they
were
the
winners
of
the
golden
fleece
and
their
story
would
be
told
forever
and
for
the
fame
that
they
had
won
men
would
forego
all
rest
and
all
delight
why
should
they
not
toil
they
who
were
born
for
great
labors
and
to
face
dangers
that
other
men
might
not
face
soon
hands
would
be
stretched
out
to
welcoming
hands
of
the
men
and
women
of
their
own
land
so
orpheus
sang
and
his
voice
and
the
music
of
his
lyre
prevailed
above
the
sirens
voices
men
dropped
their
oars
but
other
men
remained
at
their
benches
and
pulled
steadily
if
wearily
on
only
one
of
the
argonauts
butes
a
youth
of
iolcus
threw
himself
into
the
water
and
swam
toward
the
rocks
from
which
the
sirens
sang
but
an
anguish
that
nearly
parted
their
spirits
from
their
bodies
was
upon
them
as
they
went
wearily
on
toward
the
end
of
the
day
they
beheld
another
island
that
seemed
very
fair
they
longed
to
land
and
rest
themselves
there
and
eat
the
fruits
of
the
island
but
orpheus
would
not
have
them
land
the
island
he
said
was
thrinacia
upon
that
island
the
cattle
of
the
sun
pastured
and
if
one
of
the
cattle
perished
through
them
their
return
home
might
not
be
won
they
heard
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
through
the
mist
and
a
deep
longing
for
the
sight
of
their
own
fields
with
a
white
house
near
and
flocks
and
herds
at
pasture
came
over
the
heroes
they
came
near
the
island
of
thrinacia
and
they
saw
the
cattle
of
the
sun
feeding
by
the
meadow
streams
not
one
of
them
was
black
all
were
white
as
milk
and
the
horns
upon
their
heads
were
golden
they
saw
the
two
nymphs
who
herded
the
and
lampetia
one
with
a
staff
of
silver
and
the
other
with
a
staff
of
gold
driven
by
the
breeze
that
came
over
the
thrinacian
sea
the
argonauts
came
to
the
land
of
the
phæacians
it
was
a
good
land
as
they
saw
when
they
drew
near
a
land
of
orchards
and
fresh
pastures
with
a
white
and
city
upon
the
height
their
spirits
came
back
to
them
as
they
drew
into
the
harbor
they
made
fast
the
hawsers
and
they
went
upon
the
ways
of
the
city
and
then
they
saw
everywhere
around
them
the
dark
faces
of
colchian
soldiers
these
were
the
men
of
king
æetes
and
they
had
come
overland
to
the
phæacian
city
hoping
to
cut
off
the
argonauts
jason
when
he
saw
the
soldiers
shouted
to
those
who
had
been
left
on
the
and
they
drew
out
of
the
harbor
fearful
lest
the
colchians
should
grapple
with
the
ship
and
wrest
from
them
the
fleece
of
gold
then
jason
made
an
encampment
upon
the
shore
and
the
captain
of
the
colchians
went
here
and
there
gathering
together
his
men
medea
left
jason
s
side
and
hastened
through
the
city
to
the
palace
of
alcinous
king
of
the
phæacians
she
went
within
the
palace
she
found
arete
the
queen
and
arete
was
sitting
by
her
hearth
spinning
golden
and
silver
threads
arete
was
young
at
that
time
as
young
as
medea
and
as
yet
no
child
had
been
born
to
her
but
she
had
the
clear
eyes
of
one
who
understands
and
who
knows
how
to
order
things
well
stately
too
was
arete
for
she
had
been
reared
in
the
house
of
a
great
king
medea
came
to
her
and
fell
upon
her
knees
before
her
and
told
her
how
she
had
fled
from
the
house
of
her
father
king
æetes
she
told
arete
too
how
she
had
helped
jason
to
win
the
golden
fleece
and
she
told
her
how
through
her
her
brother
had
been
led
to
his
death
as
she
told
this
part
of
her
story
she
wept
and
prayed
at
the
knees
of
the
queen
arete
was
greatly
moved
by
medea
s
tears
and
prayers
she
went
to
alcinous
in
his
garden
and
she
begged
of
him
to
save
the
argonauts
from
the
great
force
of
the
colchians
that
had
come
to
cut
them
off
the
golden
fleece
said
arete
has
been
won
by
the
tasks
that
jason
performed
if
the
colchians
should
take
medea
it
would
be
to
bring
her
back
to
aea
and
to
a
bitter
doom
and
the
maiden
said
the
queen
has
broken
my
heart
by
her
prayers
and
king
alcinous
said
æetes
is
strong
and
although
his
kingdom
is
far
from
ours
he
can
bring
war
upon
but
still
arete
pleaded
with
him
to
protect
medea
from
the
colchians
alcinous
went
within
he
raised
up
medea
from
where
she
crouched
on
the
floor
of
the
palace
and
he
promised
her
that
the
argonauts
would
be
protected
in
his
city
then
the
king
mounted
his
chariot
medea
went
with
him
and
they
came
down
to
the
seashore
where
the
heroes
had
made
their
encampment
the
argonauts
and
the
colchians
were
drawn
up
against
each
other
and
the
colchians
far
outnumbered
the
wearied
heroes
alcinous
drove
his
chariot
between
the
two
armies
the
colchians
prayed
him
to
have
the
strangers
make
surrender
to
them
but
the
king
drove
his
chariot
to
where
the
heroes
stood
and
he
took
the
hand
of
each
and
received
them
as
his
guests
then
the
colchians
knew
that
they
might
not
make
war
upon
the
heroes
they
drew
off
the
next
day
they
marched
away
it
was
a
rich
land
that
they
had
come
to
once
aristæus
dwelt
there
the
king
who
discovered
how
to
make
bees
store
up
their
honey
for
men
and
how
to
make
the
good
olive
grow
macris
his
daughter
tended
dionysus
the
son
of
zeus
when
hermes
brought
him
of
the
flame
and
moistened
his
lips
with
honey
she
tended
him
in
a
cave
in
the
phæacian
land
and
ever
afterward
the
phæacians
were
blessed
with
all
good
things
now
as
the
heroes
marched
to
the
palace
of
king
alcinous
the
people
came
to
meet
them
bringing
them
sheep
and
calves
and
jars
of
wine
and
honey
the
women
brought
them
fresh
garments
to
medea
they
gave
fine
linen
and
golden
ornaments
amongst
the
phæacians
who
loved
music
and
games
and
the
telling
of
stories
the
heroes
stayed
for
long
there
were
dances
and
to
the
phæacians
who
honored
him
as
a
god
orpheus
played
upon
his
lyre
and
every
day
for
the
seven
days
that
they
stayed
amongst
them
the
phæacians
brought
rich
presents
to
the
heroes
and
medea
looking
into
the
clear
eyes
of
queen
arete
knew
that
she
was
the
woman
of
whom
circe
had
prophesied
the
woman
who
knew
nothing
of
enchantments
but
who
had
much
human
wisdom
she
was
to
ask
of
her
what
she
was
to
do
in
her
life
and
what
she
was
to
leave
undone
and
what
this
woman
told
her
medea
was
to
regard
arete
told
her
that
she
was
to
forget
all
the
witcheries
and
enchantments
that
she
knew
and
that
she
was
never
to
practice
against
the
life
of
any
one
this
she
told
medea
upon
the
shore
before
jason
lifted
her
aboard
the
vii
they
come
to
the
desert
land
decorative
first
letter
now
with
sail
spread
wide
the
went
on
and
the
heroes
rested
at
the
oars
the
wind
grew
stronger
it
became
a
great
blast
and
for
nine
days
and
nine
nights
the
ship
was
driven
fearfully
along
the
blast
drove
them
into
the
gulf
of
libya
from
whence
there
is
no
return
for
ships
on
each
side
of
the
gulf
there
are
rocks
and
shoals
and
the
sea
runs
toward
the
limitless
sand
on
the
top
of
a
mighty
tide
the
was
lifted
and
she
was
flung
high
up
on
the
desert
sands
a
flood
tide
such
as
might
not
come
again
for
long
left
the
argonauts
on
the
empty
libyan
land
and
when
they
came
forth
and
saw
that
vast
level
of
sand
stretching
like
a
mist
away
into
the
distance
a
deadly
fear
came
over
each
of
them
no
spring
of
water
could
they
descry
no
path
no
herdsman
s
cabin
over
all
that
vast
land
there
was
silence
and
dead
calm
and
one
said
to
the
other
what
land
is
this
whither
have
we
come
would
that
the
tempest
had
overwhelmed
us
or
would
that
we
had
lost
the
ship
and
our
lives
between
the
clashing
rocks
at
the
time
when
we
were
making
our
way
into
the
sea
of
and
the
helmsman
looking
before
him
said
with
a
breaking
heart
out
of
this
we
may
not
come
even
should
the
breeze
blow
from
the
land
for
all
around
us
are
shoals
and
sharp
that
we
can
see
fretting
the
water
line
upon
line
our
ship
would
have
been
shattered
far
from
the
shore
if
the
tide
had
not
borne
her
far
up
on
the
sand
but
now
the
tide
rushes
back
toward
the
sea
leaving
only
foam
on
which
no
ship
can
sail
to
cover
the
sand
and
so
all
hope
of
our
return
is
cut
he
spoke
with
tears
flowing
upon
his
cheeks
and
all
who
had
knowledge
of
ships
agreed
with
what
the
helmsman
had
said
no
dangers
that
they
had
been
through
were
as
terrible
as
this
hopelessly
like
lifeless
specters
the
heroes
strayed
about
the
endless
strand
they
embraced
each
other
and
they
said
farewell
as
they
laid
down
upon
the
sand
that
might
blow
upon
them
and
overwhelm
them
in
the
night
they
wrapped
their
heads
in
their
cloaks
and
fasting
they
laid
themselves
down
jason
crouched
beside
the
ship
so
troubled
that
his
life
nearly
went
from
him
he
saw
medea
huddled
against
a
rock
and
with
her
hair
streaming
on
the
sand
he
saw
the
men
who
with
all
the
bravery
of
their
lives
had
come
with
him
stretched
on
the
desert
sand
weary
and
without
hope
he
thought
that
they
the
best
of
men
might
die
in
this
desert
with
their
deeds
all
unknown
he
thought
that
he
might
never
win
home
with
medea
to
make
her
his
queen
in
iolcus
he
lay
against
the
side
of
the
ship
his
cloak
wrapped
around
his
head
and
there
death
would
have
come
to
him
and
to
the
others
if
the
nymphs
of
the
desert
had
been
unmindful
of
these
brave
men
they
came
to
jason
it
was
midday
then
and
the
fierce
rays
of
the
sun
were
scorching
all
libya
they
drew
off
the
cloak
that
wrapped
his
head
they
stood
near
him
three
nymphs
girded
around
with
goatskins
why
art
thou
so
smitten
with
despair
the
nymphs
said
to
jason
why
art
thou
smitten
with
despair
thou
who
hast
wrought
so
much
and
hast
won
so
much
up
arouse
thy
comrades
we
are
the
solitary
nymphs
the
warders
of
the
land
of
libya
and
we
have
come
to
show
a
way
of
escape
to
you
the
argonauts
look
around
and
watch
for
the
time
when
poseidon
s
great
horse
shall
be
unloosed
then
make
ready
to
pay
recompense
to
the
mother
that
bore
you
all
what
she
did
for
you
all
that
you
all
must
do
for
her
by
doing
it
you
will
win
back
to
the
land
of
jason
heard
them
say
these
words
and
then
he
saw
them
no
more
the
nymphs
vanished
amongst
the
desert
mounds
illustration
then
jason
rose
up
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
out
of
what
had
been
told
him
but
there
was
courage
now
and
hope
in
his
heart
he
shouted
his
voice
was
like
the
roar
of
a
lion
calling
to
his
mate
at
his
shout
his
comrades
roused
themselves
all
squalid
with
the
dust
of
the
desert
the
argonauts
stood
around
him
listen
comrades
to
me
jason
said
while
i
speak
of
a
strange
thing
that
has
befallen
me
while
i
lay
by
the
side
of
our
ship
three
nymphs
came
before
me
with
light
hands
they
drew
away
the
cloak
that
wrapped
my
head
they
declared
themselves
to
be
the
solitary
nymphs
the
warders
of
libya
very
strange
were
the
words
they
said
to
me
when
poseidon
s
great
horse
shall
be
unloosed
they
said
we
were
to
make
the
mother
of
us
all
a
recompense
doing
for
her
what
she
had
done
for
us
all
this
the
nymphs
told
me
to
say
but
i
can
not
understand
the
meaning
of
their
there
were
some
there
who
would
not
have
given
heed
to
jason
s
words
deeming
them
words
without
meaning
but
even
as
he
spoke
a
wonder
came
before
their
eyes
out
of
the
sea
a
great
horse
leaped
vast
he
was
of
size
and
he
had
a
golden
mane
he
shook
the
spray
of
the
sea
off
his
sides
and
mane
past
them
he
trampled
and
away
toward
the
horizon
leaving
great
tracks
in
the
sand
then
nestor
spoke
rejoicingly
behold
the
great
horse
it
is
the
horse
that
the
desert
nymphs
spoke
of
poseidon
s
horse
even
now
has
the
horse
been
unloosed
and
now
is
the
time
to
do
what
the
nymphs
bade
us
do
who
but
is
the
mother
of
us
all
she
has
carried
us
now
we
must
make
her
a
recompense
and
carry
her
even
as
she
carried
us
with
untiring
shoulders
we
must
bear
across
this
great
desert
and
whither
shall
we
bear
her
whither
but
along
the
tracks
that
poseidon
s
horse
has
left
in
the
sand
poseidon
s
horse
will
not
go
under
the
again
he
will
plunge
into
the
sea
so
nestor
said
and
the
argonauts
saw
truth
in
his
saying
hope
came
to
them
hope
of
leaving
that
desert
and
coming
to
the
sea
surely
when
they
came
to
the
sea
again
and
spread
the
sail
and
held
the
oars
in
their
hands
their
sacred
ship
would
make
swift
course
to
their
native
land
viii
the
carrying
of
the
argo
decorative
first
letter
the
terrible
weight
of
the
ship
upon
their
shoulders
the
argonauts
made
their
way
across
the
desert
following
the
tracks
of
poseidon
s
horse
like
a
wounded
serpent
that
drags
with
pain
its
length
along
they
went
day
after
day
across
that
limitless
land
a
day
came
when
they
saw
the
great
tracks
of
the
horse
no
more
a
wind
had
come
up
and
had
covered
them
with
sand
with
the
mighty
weight
of
the
ship
upon
their
shoulders
with
the
sun
beating
upon
their
heads
and
with
no
marks
on
the
desert
to
guide
them
the
heroes
stood
there
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
blood
must
gush
up
and
out
of
their
hearts
illustration
then
zetes
and
calais
sons
of
the
north
wind
rose
up
upon
their
wings
to
strive
to
get
sight
of
the
sea
up
up
they
soared
and
then
as
a
man
sees
or
thinks
he
sees
at
the
month
s
beginning
the
moon
through
a
bank
of
clouds
zetes
and
calais
looking
over
the
measureless
land
saw
the
gleam
of
water
they
shouted
to
the
argonauts
they
marked
the
way
for
them
and
wearily
but
with
good
hearts
the
heroes
went
upon
the
way
they
came
at
last
to
the
shore
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
wide
inland
sea
they
set
down
from
off
their
shoulders
and
they
let
her
keel
take
water
once
more
all
salt
and
brackish
was
that
water
they
dipped
their
hands
into
and
tasted
the
salt
orpheus
was
able
to
name
the
water
they
had
come
to
it
was
that
lake
that
was
called
after
triton
the
son
of
nereus
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
they
set
up
an
altar
and
they
made
sacrifices
in
thanksgiving
to
the
gods
they
had
come
to
water
at
last
but
now
they
had
to
seek
for
other
the
sweet
water
that
they
could
drink
all
around
them
they
looked
but
they
saw
no
sign
of
a
spring
and
then
they
felt
a
wind
blow
upon
wind
that
had
in
it
not
the
dust
of
the
desert
but
the
fragrance
of
growing
things
toward
where
that
wind
blew
from
they
went
as
they
went
on
they
saw
a
great
shape
against
the
sky
they
saw
mountainous
shoulders
bowed
orpheus
bade
them
halt
and
turn
their
faces
with
reverence
toward
that
great
shape
for
this
was
atlas
the
titan
the
brother
of
prometheus
who
stood
there
to
hold
up
the
sky
on
his
shoulders
then
they
were
near
the
place
that
the
fragrance
had
blown
from
there
was
a
garden
there
the
only
fence
that
ran
around
it
was
a
lattice
of
silver
surely
there
are
springs
in
the
garden
the
argonauts
said
we
will
enter
this
fair
garden
now
and
slake
our
orpheus
bade
them
walk
reverently
for
all
around
them
he
said
was
sacred
ground
this
garden
was
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
that
was
watched
over
by
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
the
argonauts
looked
through
the
silver
lattice
they
saw
trees
with
lovely
fruit
and
they
saw
three
maidens
moving
through
the
garden
with
watchful
eyes
in
this
garden
grew
the
tree
that
had
the
golden
apples
that
zeus
gave
to
hera
as
a
wedding
gift
they
saw
the
tree
on
which
the
golden
apples
grew
the
maidens
went
to
it
and
then
looked
watchfully
all
around
them
they
saw
the
faces
of
the
argonauts
looking
through
the
silver
lattice
and
they
cried
out
one
to
the
other
and
they
joined
their
hands
around
the
tree
but
orpheus
called
to
them
and
the
maidens
understood
the
divine
speech
of
orpheus
he
made
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
know
that
they
who
stood
before
the
lattice
were
men
who
reverenced
the
gods
who
would
not
strive
to
enter
the
forbidden
garden
the
maidens
came
toward
them
beautiful
as
the
singing
of
orpheus
was
their
utterance
but
what
they
said
was
a
complaint
and
a
lament
their
lament
was
for
the
dragon
ladon
that
dragon
with
a
hundred
heads
that
guarded
sleeplessly
the
tree
that
had
the
golden
apples
now
that
dragon
was
slain
with
arrows
that
had
been
dipped
in
the
poison
of
the
hydra
s
blood
their
dragon
ladon
had
been
slain
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
sang
of
how
a
mortal
had
come
into
the
garden
that
they
watched
over
he
had
a
great
bow
and
with
his
arrow
he
slew
the
dragon
that
guarded
the
golden
apples
the
golden
apples
he
had
taken
away
they
had
come
back
to
the
tree
they
had
been
plucked
from
for
no
mortal
might
keep
them
in
his
possession
so
the
maidens
eretheis
and
they
complained
that
now
unhelped
by
the
dragon
they
had
to
keep
guard
over
the
tree
the
argonauts
knew
of
whom
they
told
the
their
comrade
would
that
heracles
were
with
them
now
the
hesperides
told
them
of
how
the
springs
in
the
garden
dried
up
because
of
his
plucking
the
golden
apples
he
came
out
of
the
garden
thirsting
nowhere
could
he
find
a
spring
of
water
to
yonder
great
rock
he
went
he
smote
it
with
his
foot
and
water
came
out
in
full
flow
then
he
leaning
on
his
hands
and
with
his
chest
upon
the
ground
drank
and
drank
from
the
water
that
flowed
from
the
rifted
rock
the
argonauts
looked
to
where
the
rock
stood
they
caught
the
sound
of
water
they
carried
medea
over
and
then
company
after
company
all
huddled
together
they
stooped
down
and
drank
their
fill
of
the
clear
good
water
with
lips
wet
with
the
water
they
cried
to
each
other
heracles
although
he
is
not
with
us
in
very
truth
heracles
has
saved
his
comrades
from
deadly
thirst
they
saw
his
footsteps
printed
upon
the
rocks
and
they
followed
them
until
they
led
to
the
sand
where
no
footsteps
stay
heracles
how
glad
his
comrades
would
have
been
if
they
could
have
had
sight
of
him
then
but
it
was
long
he
had
sailed
with
heracles
had
been
here
still
hearing
their
complaint
they
turned
back
to
the
lattice
to
where
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
stood
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
bent
their
heads
to
listen
to
what
the
argonauts
told
one
another
and
seeing
them
bent
to
listen
orpheus
told
a
story
about
one
who
had
gone
across
the
libyan
desert
about
one
who
was
a
hero
like
unto
heracles
the
story
of
perseus
beyond
where
atlas
stands
there
is
a
cave
where
the
strange
women
the
ancient
daughters
of
phorcys
live
they
have
been
gray
from
their
birth
they
have
but
one
eye
and
one
tooth
between
them
and
they
pass
the
eye
and
the
tooth
one
to
the
other
when
they
would
see
or
eat
they
are
called
the
graiai
these
two
sisters
up
to
the
cave
where
they
lived
a
youth
once
came
he
was
beardless
and
the
garb
he
wore
was
torn
and
but
he
had
shapeliness
and
beauty
in
his
leathern
belt
there
was
an
exceedingly
bright
sword
this
sword
was
not
straight
like
the
swords
we
carry
but
it
was
hooked
like
a
sickle
the
strange
youth
with
the
bright
strange
sword
came
very
quickly
and
very
silently
up
to
the
cave
where
the
graiai
lived
and
looked
over
a
high
boulder
into
it
one
was
sitting
munching
acorns
with
the
single
tooth
the
other
had
the
eye
in
her
hand
she
was
holding
it
to
her
forehead
and
looking
into
the
back
of
the
cave
these
two
ancient
women
with
their
gray
hair
falling
over
them
like
thick
fleeces
and
with
faces
that
were
only
forehead
and
cheeks
and
nose
and
mouth
were
strange
creatures
truly
very
silently
the
youth
stood
looking
at
them
sister

cried
the
one
who
was
munching
acorns
sister

your
eye
this
way
i
heard
the
stir
of
the
other

and
with
the
eye
placed
against
her
forehead
looked
out
to
the
opening
of
the
cave
the
youth
drew
back
behind
the
boulder
sister

one
with

eye

she

the
one

out

and
the
one
who

the
eye
the
youth

into
the
cave
standing
between
the
eyeless

tooth
and
with

the
eye

they
stood
together
and
the
youth
watched
their
blinking
faces
as
they
tried
to
discover
who
had
come
into
the
cave
and
who
had
taken
the
eye
and
the
tooth
then
they
said
screaming
together

taken
the
eye
and
the
tooth
from
the
graiai
the
ancient
daughters
of
phorcys

and

the
other
the
youth
put
the
eye
in
the
hand
of
one
and
the
tooth
in
the
hand
of
the
other
but
he
held
their
skinny
hands
in
his
strong
hands
until
they
should
tell
him
where
the
nymphs
dwelt
who
guarded
the
magic
treasures
the
gray
ones
told
him
then
the
youth
with
the
bright
sword
left
the
cave
as
he
went
out
he
saw
on
the
ground
a
shield
of
bronze
and
he
took
it
with
him
to
the
other
side
of
where
atlas
stands
he
went
there
he
came
upon
the
nymphs
in
their
valley
they
had
long
dwelt
there
hidden
from
gods
and
men
and
they
were
startled
to
see
a
stranger
youth
come
into
their
hidden
valley
they
fled
away
then
the
youth
sat
on
the
ground
his
head
bent
like
a
man
who
is
very
sorrowful
the
youngest
and
the
fairest
of
the
nymphs
came
to
him
at
last
why
have
you
come
and
why
do
you
sit
here
in
such
great
trouble
youth
said
she
and
then
she
said
what
is
this
strange
that
you
wear
who
told
you
the
way
to
our
dwelling
place
what
name
have
you
i
have
come
here
said
the
youth
and
he
took
the
bronze
shield
upon
his
knees
and
began
to
polish
it
i
have
come
here
because
i
want
you
the
nymphs
who
guard
them
to
give
to
me
the
cap
of
darkness
and
the
shoes
of
flight
and
the
magic
pouch
i
must
gain
these
things
without
them
i
must
go
to
my
death
why
i
must
gain
them
you
will
know
from
my
when
he
said
that
he
had
come
for
the
three
magic
treasures
that
they
guarded
the
kind
nymph
was
more
startled
than
she
and
her
sisters
had
been
startled
by
the
appearance
of
the
strange
youth
in
their
hidden
valley
she
turned
away
from
him
but
she
looked
again
and
she
saw
that
he
was
beautiful
and
brave
looking
he
had
spoken
of
his
death
the
nymph
stood
looking
at
him
pitifully
and
the
youth
with
the
bronze
shield
laid
beside
his
knees
and
the
strange
hooked
sword
lying
across
it
told
her
his
story
i
am
perseus
he
said
and
my
grandfather
men
say
is
king
in
argos
his
name
is
acrisius
before
i
was
born
a
prophecy
was
made
to
him
that
the
son
of
danaë
his
daughter
would
slay
him
acrisius
was
frightened
by
the
prophecy
and
when
i
was
born
he
put
my
mother
and
myself
into
a
chest
and
he
sent
us
adrift
upon
the
waves
of
the
sea
i
did
not
know
what
a
terrible
peril
i
was
in
for
i
was
an
infant
newly
born
my
mother
was
so
hopeless
that
she
came
near
to
death
but
the
wind
and
the
waves
did
not
destroy
us
they
brought
us
to
a
shore
a
shepherd
found
the
chest
and
he
opened
it
and
brought
my
mother
and
myself
out
of
it
alive
the
land
we
had
come
to
was
seriphus
the
shepherd
who
found
the
chest
and
who
rescued
my
mother
and
myself
was
the
brother
of
the
king
his
name
was
dictys
in
the
shepherd
s
wattled
house
my
mother
stayed
with
me
a
little
infant
and
in
that
house
i
grew
from
babyhood
to
childhood
and
from
childhood
to
boyhood
he
was
a
kind
man
this
shepherd
dictys
his
brother
polydectes
had
put
him
away
from
the
palace
but
dictys
did
not
grieve
for
that
for
he
was
happy
minding
his
sheep
upon
the
hillside
and
he
was
happy
in
his
little
hut
of
wattles
and
clay
polydectes
the
king
was
seldom
spoken
to
about
his
brother
and
it
was
years
before
he
knew
of
the
mother
and
child
who
had
been
brought
to
live
in
dictys
s
hut
but
at
last
he
heard
of
us
for
strange
things
began
to
be
said
about
my
she
was
beautiful
and
how
she
looked
like
one
who
had
been
favored
by
the
gods
then
one
day
when
he
was
hunting
polydectes
the
king
came
to
the
hut
of
dictys
the
shepherd
he
saw
danaë
my
mother
there
by
her
looks
he
knew
that
she
was
a
king
s
daughter
and
one
who
had
been
favored
by
the
gods
he
wanted
her
for
his
wife
but
my
mother
hated
this
harsh
and
overbearing
king
and
she
would
not
wed
with
him
often
he
came
storming
around
the
shepherd
s
hut
and
at
last
my
mother
had
to
take
refuge
from
him
in
a
temple
there
she
became
the
priestess
of
the
goddess
i
was
taken
to
the
palace
of
polydectes
and
there
i
was
brought
up
the
king
still
stormed
around
where
my
mother
was
more
and
more
bent
on
making
her
marry
him
if
she
had
not
been
in
the
temple
where
she
was
under
the
protection
of
the
goddess
he
would
have
wed
her
against
her
will
but
i
was
growing
up
now
and
i
was
able
to
give
some
protection
to
my
mother
my
arm
was
a
strong
one
and
polydectes
knew
that
if
he
wronged
my
mother
in
any
way
i
had
the
will
and
the
power
to
be
deadly
to
him
one
day
i
heard
him
say
before
his
princes
and
his
lords
that
he
would
wed
and
would
wed
one
who
was
not
danaë
i
was
overjoyed
to
hear
him
say
this
he
asked
the
lords
and
the
princes
to
come
to
the
wedding
feast
they
declared
they
would
and
they
told
him
of
the
presents
they
would
bring
then
king
polydectes
turned
to
me
and
he
asked
me
to
come
to
the
wedding
feast
i
said
i
would
come
and
then
because
i
was
young
and
full
of
the
boast
of
youth
and
because
the
king
was
now
ceasing
to
be
a
terror
to
me
i
said
that
i
would
bring
to
his
wedding
feast
the
head
of
the
gorgon
the
king
smiled
when
he
heard
me
say
this
but
he
smiled
not
as
a
good
man
smiles
when
he
hears
the
boast
of
youth
he
smiled
and
he
turned
to
the
princes
and
lords
and
he
said
perseus
will
come
and
he
will
bring
a
greater
gift
than
any
of
you
for
he
will
bring
the
head
of
her
whose
gaze
turns
living
creatures
into
when
i
heard
the
king
speak
so
grimly
about
my
boast
the
fearfulness
of
the
thing
i
had
spoken
of
doing
came
over
me
i
thought
for
an
instant
that
the
gorgon
s
head
appeared
before
me
and
that
i
was
then
and
there
turned
into
stone
the
day
of
the
wedding
feast
came
i
came
and
i
brought
no
gift
i
stood
with
my
head
hanging
for
shame
then
the
princes
and
the
lords
came
forward
and
they
showed
the
great
gifts
of
horses
that
they
had
brought
i
thought
that
the
king
would
forget
about
me
and
about
my
boast
and
then
i
heard
him
call
my
name
perseus
he
said
perseus
bring
before
us
now
the
gorgon
s
head
that
as
you
told
us
you
would
bring
for
the
wedding
the
princes
and
lords
and
people
looked
toward
me
and
i
was
filled
with
a
deeper
shame
i
had
to
say
that
i
had
failed
to
bring
a
present
then
that
harsh
and
overbearing
king
shouted
at
me
go
forth
he
said
go
forth
and
fetch
the
present
that
you
spoke
of
if
you
do
not
bring
it
remain
forever
out
of
my
country
for
in
seriphus
we
will
have
no
empty
the
lords
and
the
princes
applauded
what
the
king
said
the
people
were
sad
for
me
and
sad
for
my
mother
but
they
might
not
do
anything
to
help
me
so
just
and
so
due
to
me
did
the
words
of
the
king
seem
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
i
had
to
go
from
the
country
of
seriphus
leaving
my
mother
at
the
mercy
of
polydectes
i
bade
to
my
sorrowful
mother
and
i
went
from
that
land
that
i
might
not
return
to
without
the
gorgon
s
head
i
traveled
far
from
that
country
one
day
i
sat
down
in
a
lonely
place
and
prayed
to
the
gods
that
my
strength
might
be
equal
to
the
will
that
now
moved
in
will
to
take
the
gorgon
s
head
and
take
from
my
name
the
shame
of
a
broken
promise
and
win
back
to
seriphus
to
save
my
mother
from
the
harshness
of
the
king
when
i
looked
up
i
saw
one
standing
before
me
he
was
a
youth
too
but
i
knew
by
the
way
he
moved
and
i
knew
by
the
brightness
of
his
face
and
eyes
that
he
was
of
the
immortals
i
raised
my
hands
in
homage
to
him
and
he
came
near
me
perseus
he
said
if
you
have
the
courage
to
strive
the
way
to
win
the
gorgon
s
head
will
be
shown
i
said
that
i
had
the
courage
to
strive
and
he
knew
that
i
was
making
no
boast
he
gave
me
this
bright
that
i
carry
he
told
me
by
what
ways
i
might
come
near
enough
to
the
gorgons
without
being
turned
into
stone
by
their
gaze
he
told
me
how
i
might
slay
the
one
of
the
three
gorgons
who
was
not
immortal
and
how
having
slain
her
i
might
take
her
head
and
flee
without
being
torn
to
pieces
by
her
sister
gorgons
then
i
knew
that
i
should
have
to
come
on
the
gorgons
from
the
air
i
knew
that
having
slain
the
one
that
could
be
slain
i
should
have
to
fly
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
and
i
knew
that
that
speed
even
would
not
save
should
have
to
be
hidden
in
my
flight
to
win
the
head
and
save
myself
i
would
need
three
magic
shoes
of
flight
and
the
magic
pouch
and
the
dogskin
cap
of
hades
that
makes
its
wearer
invisible
the
youth
said
the
magic
pouch
and
the
shoes
of
flight
and
the
dogskin
cap
of
hades
are
in
the
keeping
of
the
nymphs
whose
dwelling
place
no
mortal
knows
i
may
not
tell
you
where
their
dwelling
place
is
but
from
the
gray
ones
from
the
ancient
daughters
of
phorcys
who
live
in
a
cave
near
where
atlas
stands
you
may
learn
where
their
dwelling
place
thereupon
he
told
me
how
i
might
come
to
the
graiai
and
how
i
might
get
them
to
tell
me
where
you
the
nymphs
had
your
dwelling
the
one
who
spoke
to
me
was
hermes
whose
dwelling
is
on
olympus
by
this
that
he
gave
me
you
will
know
that
i
speak
the
perseus
ceased
speaking
and
she
who
was
the
youngest
and
fairest
of
the
nymphs
came
nearer
to
him
she
knew
that
he
spoke
truthfully
and
besides
she
had
pity
for
the
youth
but
we
are
the
keepers
of
the
magic
treasures
she
said
and
some
one
whose
need
is
greater
even
than
yours
may
some
time
require
them
from
us
but
will
you
swear
that
you
will
bring
the
magic
treasures
back
to
us
when
you
have
slain
the
gorgon
and
have
taken
her
head
perseus
declared
that
he
would
bring
the
magic
treasures
back
to
the
nymphs
and
leave
them
once
more
in
their
keeping
then
the
nymph
who
had
compassion
for
him
called
to
the
others
they
spoke
together
while
perseus
stayed
far
away
from
them
polishing
his
shield
of
bronze
at
last
the
nymph
who
had
listened
to
him
came
back
the
others
following
her
they
brought
to
perseus
and
they
put
into
his
hands
the
things
they
had
cap
made
from
dogskin
that
had
been
brought
up
out
of
hades
a
pair
of
winged
shoes
and
a
long
pouch
that
he
could
hang
across
his
shoulder
and
so
with
the
shoes
of
flight
and
the
cap
of
darkness
and
the
magic
pouch
perseus
went
to
seek
the
gorgons
the
that
hermes
gave
him
was
at
his
side
and
on
his
arm
he
held
the
bronze
shield
that
was
now
well
polished
he
went
through
the
air
taking
a
way
that
the
nymphs
had
shown
him
he
came
to
oceanus
that
was
the
rim
around
the
world
he
saw
forms
that
were
of
living
creatures
all
in
stone
and
he
knew
that
he
was
near
the
place
where
the
gorgons
had
their
lair
then
looking
upon
the
surface
of
his
polished
shield
he
saw
the
gorgons
below
him
two
were
covered
with
hard
serpent
scales
they
had
tusks
that
were
long
and
were
like
the
tusks
of
boars
and
they
had
hands
of
gleaming
brass
and
wings
of
shining
gold
still
looking
upon
the
shining
surface
of
his
shield
perseus
went
down
and
down
he
saw
the
third
who
was
not
immortal
she
had
a
woman
s
face
and
form
and
her
countenance
was
beautiful
although
there
was
something
deadly
in
its
fairness
the
two
scaled
and
winged
sisters
were
asleep
but
the
third
medusa
was
awake
and
she
was
tearing
with
her
hands
a
lizard
that
had
come
near
her
upon
her
head
was
a
tangle
of
serpents
all
with
heads
raised
as
though
they
were
hissing
still
looking
into
the
mirror
of
his
shield
perseus
came
down
and
over
medusa
he
turned
his
head
away
from
her
then
with
a
sweep
of
the
he
took
her
head
off
there
was
no
scream
from
the
gorgon
but
the
serpents
upon
her
head
hissed
loudly
still
with
his
face
turned
from
it
he
lifted
up
the
head
by
its
tangle
of
serpents
he
put
it
into
the
magic
pouch
he
rose
up
in
the
air
but
now
the
gorgon
sisters
were
awake
they
had
heard
the
hiss
of
medusa
s
serpents
and
now
they
looked
upon
her
headless
body
they
rose
up
on
their
golden
wings
and
their
brazen
hands
were
stretched
out
to
tear
the
one
who
had
slain
medusa
as
they
flew
after
him
they
screamed
aloud
although
he
flew
like
the
wind
the
gorgon
sisters
would
have
overtaken
him
if
he
had
been
plain
to
their
eyes
but
the
dogskin
cap
of
hades
saved
him
for
the
gorgon
sisters
did
not
know
whether
he
was
above
or
below
them
behind
or
before
them
on
perseus
went
flying
toward
where
atlas
stood
he
flew
over
this
place
over
libya
drops
of
blood
from
medusa
s
head
fell
down
upon
the
desert
they
were
changed
and
became
the
deadly
serpents
that
are
on
these
sands
and
around
these
rocks
on
and
on
perseus
flew
toward
atlas
and
toward
the
hidden
valley
where
the
nymphs
who
were
again
to
guard
the
magic
treasures
had
their
dwelling
place
but
before
he
came
to
the
nymphs
perseus
had
another
adventure
in
ethopia
which
is
at
the
other
side
of
libya
there
ruled
a
king
whose
name
was
cepheus
this
king
had
permitted
his
queen
to
boast
that
she
was
more
beautiful
than
the
nymphs
of
the
sea
in
punishment
for
the
queen
s
impiety
and
for
the
king
s
folly
poseidon
sent
a
monster
out
of
the
sea
to
waste
that
country
every
year
the
monster
came
destroying
more
and
more
of
the
country
of
ethopia
then
the
king
asked
of
an
oracle
what
he
should
do
to
save
his
land
and
his
people
the
oracle
spoke
of
a
dreadful
thing
that
he
would
have
to
would
have
to
sacrifice
his
daughter
the
beautiful
princess
andromeda
the
king
was
forced
by
his
savage
people
to
take
the
maiden
andromeda
and
chain
her
to
a
rock
on
the
seashore
leaving
her
there
for
the
monster
to
devour
her
satisfying
himself
with
that
prey
perseus
flying
near
heard
the
maiden
s
laments
he
saw
her
lovely
body
bound
with
chains
to
the
rock
he
came
near
her
taking
the
cap
of
darkness
off
his
head
she
saw
him
and
she
bent
her
head
in
shame
for
she
thought
that
he
would
think
that
it
was
for
some
dreadful
fault
of
her
own
that
she
had
been
left
chained
in
that
place
her
father
had
stayed
near
perseus
saw
him
and
called
to
him
and
bade
him
tell
why
the
maiden
was
chained
to
the
rock
the
king
told
perseus
of
the
sacrifice
that
he
had
been
forced
to
make
then
perseus
came
near
the
maiden
and
he
saw
how
she
looked
at
him
with
pleading
eyes
then
perseus
made
her
father
promise
that
he
would
give
andromeda
to
him
for
his
wife
if
he
should
slay
the
sea
monster
gladly
cepheus
promised
this
then
perseus
once
again
drew
his
by
the
rock
to
which
andromeda
was
still
chained
he
waited
for
sight
of
the
sea
monster
illustration
perseus
and
andromeda
it
came
rolling
in
from
the
open
sea
a
shapeless
and
unsightly
thing
with
the
shoes
of
flight
upon
his
feet
perseus
rose
above
it
the
monster
saw
his
shadow
upon
the
water
and
savagely
it
went
to
attack
the
shadow
perseus
swooped
down
as
an
eagle
swoops
down
with
his
he
attacked
it
and
he
struck
the
hook
through
the
monster
s
shoulder
terribly
it
reared
up
from
the
sea
perseus
rose
over
it
escaping
its
mouth
with
its
treble
rows
of
fangs
again
he
swooped
and
struck
at
it
its
hide
was
covered
all
over
with
hard
scales
and
with
the
shells
of
sea
things
but
perseus
s
sword
struck
through
it
it
reared
up
again
spouting
water
mixed
with
blood
on
a
rock
near
the
rock
that
andromeda
was
chained
to
perseus
alighted
the
monster
seeing
him
bellowed
and
rushed
swiftly
through
the
water
to
overwhelm
him
as
it
reared
up
he
plunged
the
sword
again
and
again
into
its
body
down
into
the
water
the
monster
sank
and
water
mixed
with
blood
was
spouted
up
from
the
depths
into
which
it
sank
then
was
andromeda
loosed
from
her
chains
perseus
the
conqueror
lifted
up
the
fainting
maiden
and
carried
her
back
to
the
king
s
palace
and
cepheus
there
renewed
his
promise
to
give
her
in
marriage
to
her
deliverer
perseus
went
on
his
way
he
came
to
the
hidden
valley
where
the
nymphs
had
their
dwelling
place
and
he
restored
to
them
the
three
magic
treasures
that
they
had
given
cap
of
darkness
the
shoes
of
flight
and
the
magic
pouch
and
these
treasures
are
still
there
and
the
hero
who
can
win
his
way
to
the
nymphs
may
have
them
as
perseus
had
them
again
he
returned
to
the
place
where
he
had
found
andromeda
chained
with
face
averted
he
drew
forth
the
gorgon
s
head
from
where
he
had
hidden
it
between
the
rocks
he
made
a
bag
for
it
out
of
the
horny
skin
of
the
monster
he
had
slain
then
carrying
his
tremendous
trophy
he
went
to
the
palace
of
king
cepheus
to
claim
his
bride
now
before
her
father
had
thought
of
sacrificing
her
to
the
sea
monster
he
had
offered
andromeda
in
marriage
to
a
prince
of
a
prince
whose
name
was
phineus
phineus
did
not
strive
to
save
andromeda
but
hearing
that
she
had
been
delivered
from
the
monster
he
came
to
take
her
for
his
wife
he
came
to
cepheus
s
palace
and
he
brought
with
him
a
thousand
armed
men
the
palace
of
cepheus
was
filled
with
armed
men
when
perseus
entered
it
he
saw
andromeda
on
a
raised
place
in
the
hall
she
was
pale
as
when
she
was
chained
to
the
rock
and
when
she
saw
him
in
the
palace
she
uttered
a
cry
of
gladness
cepheus
the
craven
king
would
have
let
him
who
had
come
with
the
armed
bands
take
the
maiden
perseus
came
beside
andromeda
and
he
made
his
claim
phineus
spoke
insolently
to
him
and
then
he
urged
one
of
his
captains
to
strike
perseus
down
many
sprang
forward
to
attack
him
out
of
the
bag
perseus
drew
medusa
s
head
he
held
it
before
those
who
were
bringing
strife
into
the
hall
they
were
turned
to
stone
one
of
cepheus
s
men
wished
to
defend
perseus
he
struck
at
the
captain
who
had
come
near
his
sword
made
a
clanging
sound
as
it
struck
this
one
who
had
looked
upon
medusa
s
head
perseus
went
from
the
land
of
ethopia
taking
fair
andromeda
with
him
they
went
into
greece
for
he
had
thought
of
going
to
argos
to
the
country
that
his
grandfather
ruled
over
at
this
very
time
acrisius
got
tidings
of
danaë
and
her
son
and
he
knew
that
they
had
not
perished
on
the
waves
of
the
sea
fearful
of
the
prophecy
that
told
he
would
be
slain
by
his
grandson
and
fearing
that
he
would
come
to
argos
to
seek
him
acrisius
fled
out
of
his
country
he
came
into
thessaly
perseus
and
andromeda
were
there
now
one
day
the
old
king
was
brought
to
games
that
were
being
celebrated
in
honor
of
a
dead
hero
he
was
leaning
on
his
staff
watching
a
youth
throw
a
metal
disk
when
something
in
that
youth
s
appearance
made
him
want
to
watch
him
more
closely
about
him
there
was
something
of
a
being
of
the
upper
air
it
made
acrisius
think
of
a
brazen
tower
and
of
a
daughter
whom
he
had
shut
up
there
he
moved
so
that
he
might
come
nearer
to
the
but
as
he
left
where
he
had
been
standing
he
came
into
the
line
of
the
thrown
disk
it
struck
the
old
man
on
the
temple
he
fell
down
dead
and
as
he
fell
the
people
cried
out
his
acrisius
king
acrisius
then
perseus
knew
whom
the
disk
thrown
by
his
hand
had
slain
and
because
he
had
slain
the
king
by
chance
perseus
would
not
go
to
argos
nor
take
over
the
kingdom
that
his
grandfather
had
reigned
over
with
andromeda
he
went
to
seriphus
where
his
mother
was
and
in
seriphus
there
still
reigned
polydectes
who
had
put
upon
him
the
terrible
task
of
winning
the
gorgon
s
head
he
came
to
seriphus
and
he
left
andromeda
in
the
hut
of
dictys
the
shepherd
no
one
knew
him
he
heard
his
name
spoken
of
as
that
of
a
youth
who
had
gone
on
a
foolish
quest
and
who
would
never
again
be
heard
of
to
the
temple
where
his
mother
was
a
priestess
he
came
guards
were
placed
all
around
it
he
heard
his
mother
s
voice
and
it
was
raised
in
lament
walled
up
here
and
given
over
to
hunger
i
shall
be
made
go
to
polydectes
s
house
and
become
his
wife
o
ye
gods
have
ye
no
pity
for
danaë
the
mother
of
perseus
perseus
cried
aloud
and
his
mother
heard
his
voice
and
her
moans
ceased
he
turned
around
and
he
went
to
the
palace
of
polydectes
the
king
the
king
received
him
with
mockeries
i
will
let
you
stay
in
seriphus
for
a
day
he
said
because
i
would
have
you
at
a
marriage
feast
i
have
vowed
that
danaë
taken
from
the
temple
where
she
sulks
will
be
my
wife
by
s
illustration
so
polydectes
said
and
the
lords
and
princes
who
were
around
him
mocked
at
perseus
and
flattered
the
king
perseus
went
from
them
then
the
next
day
he
came
back
to
the
palace
but
in
his
hands
now
there
was
a
dread
bag
made
from
the
hide
of
the
sea
monster
that
had
in
it
the
gorgon
s
head
he
saw
his
mother
she
was
brought
in
white
and
fainting
thinking
that
she
would
now
have
to
wed
the
harsh
and
overbearing
king
then
she
saw
her
son
and
hope
came
into
her
face
the
king
seeing
perseus
said
step
forward
o
youngling
and
see
your
mother
wed
to
a
mighty
man
step
forward
to
witness
a
marriage
and
then
depart
for
it
is
not
right
that
a
youth
that
makes
promises
and
does
not
keep
them
should
stay
in
a
land
that
i
rule
over
step
forward
now
you
with
the
empty
but
not
with
empty
hands
did
perseus
step
forward
he
shouted
out
i
have
brought
something
to
you
at
last
o
present
to
you
and
your
mocking
friends
but
you
o
my
mother
and
you
o
my
friends
avert
your
faces
from
what
i
have
saying
this
perseus
drew
out
the
gorgon
s
head
holding
it
by
the
snaky
locks
he
stood
before
the
company
his
mother
and
his
friends
averted
their
faces
but
polydectes
and
his
insolent
friends
looked
full
upon
what
perseus
showed
this
youth
would
strive
to
frighten
us
with
some
conjuror
s
trick
they
said
they
said
no
more
for
they
became
as
stones
and
as
stone
images
they
still
stand
in
that
hall
in
seriphus
he
went
to
the
shepherd
s
hut
and
he
brought
dictys
from
it
with
andromeda
dictys
he
made
king
in
polydectes
s
stead
then
with
danaë
and
andromeda
his
mother
and
his
wife
he
went
from
seriphus
he
did
not
go
to
argos
the
country
that
his
grandfather
had
ruled
over
although
the
people
there
wanted
perseus
to
come
to
them
and
be
king
over
them
he
took
the
kingdom
of
tiryns
in
exchange
for
that
of
argos
and
there
he
lived
with
andromeda
his
lovely
wife
out
of
ethopia
they
had
a
son
named
perses
who
became
the
parent
of
the
persian
people
the
that
had
slain
the
gorgon
went
back
to
hermes
and
hermes
took
medusa
s
head
also
that
head

his

a

serpent
was
in

was
not
a
serpent
that
would
strike
at
one
who
turned
from
it
nauplius
trod
upon
it
and
the
serpent
lifted
its
head
up
and
bit
his
foot
they
raised
him
on
their
shoulders
and
they
hurried
back
with
him
but
his
limbs
became
numb
and
when
they
laid
him
down
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
he
stayed
moveless
soon
he
grew
cold
they
dug
a
grave
for
nauplius
beside
the
lake
and
in
that
desert
land
they
set
up
his
helmsman
s
oar
in
the
middle
of
his

of
heaped

and
now
like

that

thither
striving
to
find
an

from

lake
no
outlet
could
they
find
and
the
way
of
their
homegoing
seemed
lost
to

again
then
orpheus
prayed
to
the
son
of
nereus
to
triton
whose
name
was
on
that
lake
to
aid
them
then
triton
appeared
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
showed
them
the
outlet
to
the
sea
and
triton
spoke
in
friendly
wise
to
the
heroes
bidding
them
go
upon
their
way
in
joy
and
as
for
labor
he
said
let
there
be
no
grieving
because
of
that
for

still
they
took
up
the
oars
and
they
pulled
toward
the

and
triton
the
friendly
immortal
helped
them
on
he
laid
hold
upon

and
he
guided
her
through
the
water
the
argonauts
saw
him
beneath
the
water
his
body
from
his
head
down
to
his
waist
was
fair
and
great
and
like
to
the
body
of
one
of
the
other
immortals
but
below
his
body
was
like
a
great
fish
s
forking
this

and
that
he
moved
with
fins
that
were
like
the
horns
of
the

triton
helped
along
until
they
came
into
the
open
sea
then
he
plunged
down
into
the
abyss
the
heroes
shouted
their
thanks
to
him
then
they
looked
at

and

the

that

they

lowered

then

they
pulled
at

all

they
rowed
and
all

and
again
when
the
next
day
came
on
then
they
saw
the
island
that
is
halfway
to

and
fair
island
of

it
was
theseus
who
first
saw
who
was
to

they
drew

near
the

island
they
wanted
water
and
they
were
fain
to
rest
there
minos
the

king
ruled
over

he
left
the
guarding
of
the
island
to
one
of
the

of

to

who
had
lived
on
after
the

of
the
bronze
men
had
been
destroyed
thrice

would
talos
stride
around
the
island
his
brazen
feet
were
tireless
now
talos
saw
the
drawing
near
he
took
up
great
rocks
and
he
hurled
them
at
the
heroes
and
very
quickly
they
had
to
draw
their
ship
out
of
range
they
were
wearied
and
their
thirst
was
consuming
them
but
still
that
bronze
man
stood
there
ready
to
sink
their
ship
with
the
great
rocks
that
he
took
up
in
his
hands
medea
stood
forward
upon
the
ship
ready
to
use
her
spells
against
the
man
of
bronze
in
body
and
limbs
he
was
made
of
bronze
and
in
these
he
was
invulnerable
but
beneath
a
sinew
in
his
ankle
there
was
a
vein
that
ran
up
to
his
neck
and
that
was
covered
by
a
thin
skin
if
that
vein
were
broken
talos
would
perish
medea
did
not
know
about
this
vein
when
she
stood
forward
upon
the
ship
to
use
her
spells
against
him
upon
a
cliff
of
crete
all
gleaming
stood
that
huge
man
of
bronze
then
as
she
was
ready
to
fling
her
spells
against
him
medea
thought
upon
the
words
that
arete
the
wise
queen
had
given
she
was
not
to
use
spells
and
not
to
practice
against
the
life
of
any
one
but
she
knew
that
there
was
no
impiety
in
using
spells
and
practicing
against
talos
for
zeus

already
doomed
all
his
race
she
stood
upon

and
with
her
magic
song
she
enchanted
him
he
whirled
round
and
round
he
struck
his
ankle
against
a
jutting
stone
the
vein
broke
and
that
which
was
the
blood
of
the
bronze
man
flowed
out
of
him
like
molten
lead
he
stood
towering
upon
the
cliff
like
a
pine
upon
a
mountaintop
that
the
woodman
had
left
half
hewn
through
and
that
a
mighty
wind
pitches
against

upon

feet
swaying
to
and
fro

emptied
of
all
his
strength
minos
s
man
of
bronze
fell
into
the
cretan
sea
the
heroes
landed
that
night
they
lay
upon
the
land
of
crete
and
rested
and
refreshed
themselves
when
dawn
came
they
drew
water
from
a
spring
and
once
more
they
went
on
board
the
a
day
came
when
the
helmsman
said
we
shall
see
the
shore
of
thessaly
and
by
sunset
we
shall
be
in
the
harbor
of
pagasæ
soon
o

shall
be
back
in

we
went
to

jason
brought
medea
to
the
front
of
the
ship
so
that
they
might
watch
together
for
thessaly
the
homeland
the
mountain
pelion
came
into

jason
exulted
as
he
looked
upon

mountain
again
he
told

ancient
centaur

called
that
night
afterward
the
pall
of
darkness
to
the
heroes
upon
the
it
seemed
as
if
black
chaos
had
come
over
the
world
again
they
knew
not
whether
they
were
adrift
upon

raised

came
over
all

such
sorrow
as
made

nearly
break

stood
there
in
utter
numbness

was
the
happiest
of

went
in

who
came
into

from

because
of
the
great
army
that

gathered
there
jason

i
decorative
first

came
once
more
together
the
heroes
of
the
quest
to
hunt
a
boar
in
and
peleus
came
telamon
theseus
and
rough
arcas
nestor
and
helen
s
brothers
polydeuces
and
castor
and
most
noted
of
all
there
came
the
arcadian
huntress
maid
atalanta
beautiful
they
all
thought
her
when
they
knew
her
aboard
the
but
even
more
beautiful
atalanta
seemed
to
the
heroes
when
she
came
amongst
them
in
her
hunting
gear
her
lovely
hair
hung
in
two
bands
across
her
shoulders
and
over
her
breast
hung
an
ivory
quiver
filled
with
arrows
they
said
that
her
face
with
its
wide
and
steady
eyes
was
maidenly
for
a
boy
s
and
boyish
for
a
maiden
s
face
swiftly
she
moved
with
her
head
held
high
and
there
was
not
one
amongst
the
heroes
who
did
not
say
oh
happy
would
that
man
be
whom
atalanta
the
unwedded
would
take
for
her
husband
all
the
heroes
said
it
but
the
one
who
said
it
most
feelingly
was
the
prince
of
calydon
young
meleagrus
he
more
than
the
other
heroes
felt
the
wonder
of
atalanta
s
beauty
now
the
boar
they
had
come
to
hunt
was
a
monster
boar
it
had
come
into
calydon
and
it
was
laying
waste
the
fields
and
orchards
and
destroying
the
people
s
cattle
and
horses
that
boar
had
been
sent
into
calydon
by
an
angry
divinity
for
when
œneus
the
king
of
the
country
was
making
sacrifice
to
the
gods
in
thanksgiving
for
a
bounteous
harvest
he
had
neglected
to
make
sacrifice
to
the
goddess
of
the
wild
things
artemis
in
her
anger
artemis
had
sent
the
monster
boar
to
lay
waste
œneus
s
realm
it
was
a
monster
boar
as
huge
as
a
bull
with
tusks
as
great
as
an
elephant
s
the
bristles
on
its
back
stood
up
like
spear
points
and
the
hot
breath
of
the
creature
withered
the
growth
on
the
ground
the
boar
tore
up
the
corn
in
the
fields
and
trampled
down
the
vines
with
their
clusters
and
heavy
bunches
of
grapes
also
it
rushed
against
the
cattle
and
destroyed
them
in
the
fields
and
no
hounds
the
huntsmen
were
able
to
bring
could
stand
before
it
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
men
had
to
leave
their
farms
and
take
refuge
behind
the
walls
of
the
city
because
of
the
ravages
of
the
boar
it
was
then
that
the

althæa
was
a
woman

had
sight
to
see
mysterious
things
but
who
had
also
a
wayward
and
passionate
heart
once
after
her
son
meleagrus
was
born
she
saw
the
three
fates
sitting
by
her
hearth
they
were
spinning
the
threads
of
her
son
s
life
and
as
they
spun
they
sang
to
each
other
an
equal
span
of
life
we
give
to
the
newborn
child
and
to
the
billet
of
wood
that
now
rests
above
the
blaze
of
the
hearing
what
the
fates
sang
and
understanding
it
althæa
had
sprung
up
from
her
bed
had
seized
the
billet
of
wood
and
had
taken
it
out
of
the
fire
before
the
flames
had
burnt
into
it
that
billet
of
wood
lay
in
her
chest
hidden
away
and
meleagrus
nor
any
one
else
save
althæa
knew
of
it
nor
knew
that
the
prince
s
life
would
last
only
for
the
space
it
would
be
kept
from
the
burning
on
the
day
of
the
hunting
he
appeared
as
the
strongest
and
bravest
of
the
youths
of
calydon
and
he
knew
not
poor
meleagrus
that
the
love
for
atalanta
that
had
sprung
into
his
heart
was
to
bring
to
the
fire
the
billet
of
wood
on
which
his
life
depended
ii
as
atalanta
went
the
bow
in
her
hands
prince
meleagrus
pressed
behind
her
then
came
jason
and
peleus
telamon
theseus
and
nestor
behind
them
came
meleagrus
s
uncles
plexippus
and
toxeus
they
came
to
a
forest
that
covered
the
side
of
a
mountain
huntsmen
had
assembled
here
with
hounds
held
in
leashes
and
with
nets
to
hold
the
rushing
quarry
and
when
they
had
all
gathered
together
they
went
through
the
forest
on
the
track
of
the
monster
boar
it
was
easy
to
track
the
boar
for
it
had
left
a
broad
trail
through
the
forest
the
heroes
and
the
huntsmen
pressed
on
they
came
to
a
marshy
covert
where
the
boar
had
its
lair
there
was
a
thickness
of
osiers
and
willows
and
tall
bullrushes
making
a
place
that
it
was
hard
for
the
hunters
to
go
through
they
roused
the
boar
with
the
blare
of
horns
and
it
came
rushing
out
foam
was
on
its
tusks
and
its
eyes
had
in
them
the
blaze
of
fire
on
the
boar
came
breaking
down
the
thicket
in
its
rush
but
the
heroes
stood
steadily
with
the
points
of
their
spears
toward
the
monster
the
hounds
were
loosed
from
their
leashes
and
they
dashed
toward
the
boar
the
boar
slashed
them
with
its
tusks
and
trampled
them
into
the
ground
jason
flung
his
spear
the
spear
went
wide
of
the
mark
another
arcas
cast
his
but
the
wood
not
the
point
of
the
spear
struck
the
boar
rousing
it
further
then
its
eyes
flamed
and
like
a
great
stone
shot
from
a
catapult
the
boar
rushed
on
the
huntsmen
who
were
stationed
to
the
right
in
that
rush
it
flung
two
youths
prone
upon
the
ground
then
might
nestor
have
missed
his
going
to
troy
and
his
part
in
that
story
for
the
boar
swerved
around
and
was
upon
him
in
an
instant
using
his
spear
as
a
leaping
pole
he
vaulted
upward
and
caught
the
branches
of
a
tree
as
the
monster
dashed
the
spear
down
in
its
rush
in
rage
the
beast
tore
at
the
trunk
of
the
tree
the
heroes
might
have
been
scattered
at
this
moment
for
telamon
had
fallen
tripped
by
the
roots
of
a
tree
and
peleus
had
had
to
throw
himself
upon
him
to
pull
him
out
of
the
way
of
danger
if
polydeuces
and
castor
had
not
dashed
up
to
their
aid
they
came
riding
upon
high
white
horses
spears
in
their
hands
the
brothers
cast
their
spears
but
neither
spear
struck
the
monster
boar
then
the
boar
turned
and
was
for
drawing
back
into
the
thicket
they
might
have
lost
it
then
for
its
retreat
was
impenetrable
but
before
it
got
clear
away
atalanta
put
an
arrow
to
the
string
drew
the
bow
to
her
shoulder
and
let
the
arrow
fly
it
struck
the
boar
and
a
patch
of
blood
was
seen
upon
its
bristles
prince
meleagrus
shouted
out
o
first
to
strike
the
monster
honor
indeed
shall
you
receive
for
this
arcadian
his
uncles
were
made
wroth
by
this
speech
as
was
another
the
arcadian
rough
arcas
arcas
dashed
forward
holding
in
his
hands
a
axe
heroes
and
huntsmen
he
cried
you
shall
see
how
a
man
s
strokes
surpass
a
girl
he
faced
the
boar
standing
on
tiptoe
with
his
axe
raised
for
the
stroke
meleagrus
s
uncles
shouted
to
encourage
him
but
the
boar
s
tusks
tore
him
before
arcas
s
axe
fell
and
the
arcadian
was
trampled
upon
the
ground
the
boar
roused
again
by
atalanta
s
arrow
turned
on
the
hunters
jason
hurled
a
spear
again
it
swerved
and
struck
a
hound
and
pinned
it
to
the
ground
then
speaking
the
name
of
atalanta
meleagrus
sprang
before
the
heroes
and
the
huntsmen
he
had
two
spears
in
his
hands
the
first
missed
and
stuck
quivering
in
the
ground
but
the
second
went
right
through
the
back
of
the
monster
boar
it
whirled
round
and
round
spouting
out
blood
and
foam
meleagrus
pressed
on
and
drove
his
hunting
knife
through
the
shoulders
of
the
monster
his
uncles
plexippus
and
toxeus
were
the
first
to
come
to
where
the
monster
boar
was
lying
outstretched
it
is
well
the
deed
you
have
done
boy
said
one
it
is
well
that
none
of
the
strangers
to
our
country
slew
the
boar
now
will
the
head
and
tusks
of
the
monster
adorn
our
hall
and
men
will
know
that
the
arms
of
our
house
can
well
protect
this
but
one
word
only
did
meleagrus
say
and
that
word
was
the
name
the
maiden
came
and
meleagrus
his
spear
upon
the
head
said
take
o
fair
arcadian
the
spoil
of
the
chase
all
know
that
it
was
you
who
inflicted
the
first
wound
upon
the
plexippus
and
toxeus
tried
to
push
him
away
as
if
meleagrus
was
still
a
boy
under
their
tutoring
he
shouted
to
them
to
stand
off
and
then
he
hacked
out
the
terrible
tusks
and
held
them
toward
atalanta
she
would
have
taken
them
for
she
who
had
never
looked
lovingly
upon
a
youth
was
moved
by
the
beauty
and
the
generosity
of
prince
meleagrus
she
would
have
taken
from
him
the
spoil
of
the
chase
but
as
she
held
out
her
arms
meleagrus
s
uncles
struck
them
with
the
poles
of
their
spears
heavy
marks
were
made
on
the
maiden
s
white
arms
madness
then
possessed
meleagrus
and
he
took
up
his
spear
and
thrust
it
first
into
the
body
of
plexippus
and
then
into
the
body
of
toxeus
his
thrusts
were
terrible
for
he
was
filled
with
the
fierceness
of
the
hunt
and
his
uncles
fell
down
in
death
then
a
great
horror
came
over
all
the
heroes
they
raised
up
the
bodies
of
plexippus
and
toxeus
and
carried
them
on
their
spears
away
from
the
place
of
the
hunting
and
toward
the
temple
of
the
gods
meleagrus
crouched
down
upon
the
ground
in
horror
of
what
he
had
done
atalanta
stood
beside
him
her
hand
upon
his
head
iii
althæa
was
in
the
temple
making
sacrifice
to
the
gods
she
saw
men
come
in
carrying
across
their
spears
the
bodies
of
two
men
she
looked
and
she
saw
that
the
dead
men
were
her
two
brothers
plexippus
and
toxeus
then
she
beat
her
breast
and
she
filled
the
temple
with
the
cries
of
her
lamentation
who
has
slain
my
brothers
who
has
slain
my
brothers
she
kept
crying
out
then
she
was
told
that
her
son
meleagrus
had
slain
her
brothers
she
had
no
tears
to
shed
then
and
in
a
hard
voice
she
asked
why
did
my
son
slay
plexippus
and
toxeus
his
uncles
the
one
who
was
wroth
with
atalanta
arcas
the
arcadian
came
to
her
and
told
her
that
her
brothers
had
been
slain
because
of
a
quarrel
about
the
girl
atalanta
my
brothers
have
been
slain
because
a
girl
bewitched
my
son
then
accursed
be
that
son
of
mine
althæa
cried
she
took
off
the
robe
of
a
priestess
and
she
put
on
a
black
robe
of
mourning
her
brothers
the
only
sons
of
her
father
had
been
slain
and
for
the
sake
of
a
girl
the
image
of
atalanta
came
before
her
and
she
felt
she
could
punish
dreadfully
her
son
but
her
son
was
not
there
to
punish
he
was
far
away
and
the
girl
for
whose
sake
he
had
killed
plexippus
and
toxeus
was
with
him
the
rage
she
had
went
back
into
her
heart
and
made
her
truly
mad
i
gave
meleagrus
life
when
i
might
have
let
it
go
from
him
with
the
burning
billet
of
wood
she
cried
and
now
he
has
taken
the
lives
of
my
and
then
her
thought
went
to
the
billet
of
wood
that
was
hidden
in
the
chest
back
to
her
house
she
went
and
when
she
went
within
she
saw
a
fire
of
pine
knots
burning
upon
the
hearth
as
she
looked
upon
their
burning
a
scorching
pain
went
through
her
but
she
went
from
the
hearth
nevertheless
and
into
the
inner
room
there
stood
the
chest
that
she
had
not
opened
for
years
she
opened
it
now
and
out
of
it
she
took
the
billet
of
wood
that
had
on
it
the
mark
of
the
burning
she
brought
it
to
the
hearth
fire
four
times
she
went
to
throw
it
into
the
fire
and
four
times
she
stayed
her
hand
the
fire
was
before
her
but
it
was
in
her
too
she
saw
the
images
of
her
brothers
lying
dead
and
saying
that
he
who
had
slain
them
should
lose
his
life
she
threw
the
billet
of
wood
into
the
fire
of
pine
knots
straightway
it
caught
fire
and
began
to
burn
and
althæa
cried
let
him
die
my
son
and
let
naught
remain
let
all
perish
with
my
brothers
even
the
kingdom
that
œneus
my
husband
then
she
turned
away
and
remained
stiffly
standing
by
the
hearth
the
life
withered
up
within
her
her
daughters
came
and
tried
to
draw
her
away
but
they
could
two
daughters
gorge
and
deianira
meleagrus
was
crouching
upon
the
ground
with
atalanta
watching
beside
him
now
he
stood
up
and
taking
her
hand
he
said
let
me
go
with
you
to
the
temple
of
the
gods
where
i
shall
strive
to
make
atonement
for
the
deed
i
have
done
she
went
with
him
but
even
as
they
came
to
the
street
of
the
city
a
sharp
and
a
burning
pain
seized
upon
meleagrus
more
and
more
burning
it
grew
and
weaker
and
weaker
he
became
he
could
not
have
moved
further
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
aid
of
atalanta
jason
and
peleus
lifted
him
across
the
threshold
and
carried
him
into
the
temple
of
the
gods
they
laid
him
down
with
his
head
upon
atalanta
s
lap
the
pain
within
him
grew
fiercer
and
fiercer
but
at
last
it
died
down
as
the
burning
billet
of
wood
sank
down
into
the
ashes
the
heroes
of
the
quest
stood
around
all
overcome
with
woe
in
the
street
they
heard
the
lamentations
for
plexippus
and
toxeus
for
prince
meleagrus
and
for
the
passing
of
the
kingdom
founded
by
œneus
atalanta
left
the
temple
and
attended
by
the
two
brothers
on
the
white
horses
polydeuces
and
castor
she
went
back
to
arcady
ii
peleus
and
his
bride
from
the
sea
i
decorative
first
letter
peleus
came
on
his
ship
to
a
bay
on
the
coast
of
thessaly
his
painted
ship
lay
between
two
great
rocks
and
from
its
poop
he
saw
a
sight
that
enchanted
him
out
from
the
sea
riding
on
a
dolphin
came
a
lovely
maiden
and
by
the
radiance
of
her
face
and
limbs
peleus
knew
her
for
one
of
the
immortal
goddesses
now
peleus
had
borne
himself
so
nobly
in
all
things
that
he
had
won
the
favor
of
the
gods
themselves
zeus
who
is
highest
amongst
the
gods
had
made
this
promise
to
peleus
he
would
honor
him
as
no
one
amongst
the
sons
of
men
had
been
honored
before
for
he
would
give
him
an
immortal
goddess
to
be
his
bride
she
who
came
out
of
the
sea
went
into
a
cave
that
was
overgrown
with
vines
and
roses
peleus
looked
into
the
cave
and
he
saw
her
sleeping
upon
skins
of
the
beasts
of
the
sea
his
heart
was
enchanted
by
the
sight
and
he
knew
that
his
life
would
be
broken
if
he
did
not
see
this
goddess
day
after
day
so
he
went
back
to
his
ship
and
he
prayed
o
zeus
now
i
claim
the
promise
that
you
once
made
to
me
let
it
be
that
this
goddess
come
with
me
or
else
plunge
my
ship
and
me
beneath
the
waves
of
the
and
when
peleus
said
this
he
looked
over
the
land
and
the
water
for
a
sign
from
zeus
even
then
the
goddess
sleeping
in
the
cave
had
dreams
such
as
had
never
before
entered
that
peaceful
resting
place
of
hers
she
dreamt
that
she
was
drawn
away
from
the
deep
and
the
wide
sea
she
dreamt
that
she
was
brought
to
a
place
that
was
strange
and
unfree
to
her
and
as
she
lay
in
the
cave
sleeping
tears
that
might
never
come
into
the
eyes
of
an
immortal
lay
around
her
heart
but
peleus
standing
on
his
painted
ship
saw
a
rainbow
touch
upon
the
sea
he
knew
by
that
sign
that
iris
the
messenger
of
zeus
had
come
down
through
the
air
then
a
strange
sight
came
before
his
eyes
out
of
the
sea
rose
the
head
of
a
man
wrinkled
and
bearded
it
was
and
the
eyes
were
very
old
peleus
knew
that
he
who
was
there
before
him
was
nereus
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
said
old
nereus
thou
hast
prayed
to
zeus
and
i
am
here
to
speak
an
answer
to
thy
prayer
she
whom
you
have
looked
upon
is
thetis
the
goddess
of
the
sea
very
loath
will
she
be
to
take
zeus
s
command
and
wed
with
thee
it
is
her
desire
to
remain
in
the
sea
unwedded
and
she
has
refused
marriage
even
with
one
of
the
immortal
then
said
peleus
zeus
promised
me
an
immortal
bride
if
thetis
may
not
be
mine
i
can
not
wed
any
other
goddess
or
mortal
then
thou
thyself
wilt
have
to
master
thetis
said
nereus
the
wise
one
of
the
sea
if
she
is
mastered
by
thee
she
can
not
go
back
to
the
sea
she
will
strive
with
all
her
strength
and
all
her
wit
to
escape
from
thee
but
thou
must
hold
her
no
matter
what
she
does
and
no
matter
how
she
shows
herself
when
thou
hast
seen
her
again
as
thou
didst
see
her
at
first
thou
wilt
know
that
thou
hast
mastered
and
when
he
had
said
this
to
peleus
nereus
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
went
under
the
waves
ii
with
his
hero
s
heart
beating
more
than
ever
it
had
beaten
yet
peleus
went
into
the
cave
kneeling
beside
her
he
looked
down
upon
the
goddess
the
dress
she
wore
was
like
green
and
silver
mail
her
face
and
limbs
were
pearly
but
through
them
came
the
radiance
that
belongs
to
the
immortals
he
touched
the
hair
of
the
goddess
of
the
sea
the
yellow
hair
that
was
so
long
that
it
might
cover
her
all
over
as
he
touched
her
hair
she
started
up
wakening
suddenly
out
of
her
sleep
his
hands
touched
her
hands
and
held
them
now
he
knew
that
if
he
should
loose
his
hold
upon
her
she
would
escape
from
him
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
that
thereafter
no
command
from
the
immortals
would
bring
her
to
him
she
changed
into
a
white
bird
that
strove
to
bear
itself
away
peleus
held
to
its
wings
and
struggled
with
the
bird
she
changed
and
became
a
tree
around
the
trunk
of
the
tree
peleus
clung
she
changed
once
more
and
this
time
her
form
became
terrible
a
spotted
leopard
she
was
now
with
burning
eyes
but
peleus
held
to
the
neck
of
the
leopard
and
was
not
affrighted
by
the
burning
eyes
then
she
changed
and
became
as
he
had
seen
her
lovely
maiden
with
the
brow
of
a
goddess
and
with
long
yellow
hair
but
now
there
was
no
radiance
in
her
face
or
in
her
limbs
she
looked
past
peleus
who
held
her
and
out
to
the
wide
sea
who
is
he
she
cried
who
has
been
given
this
mastery
over
me
then
said
the
hero
i
am
peleus
and
zeus
has
given
me
the
mastery
over
thee
wilt
thou
come
with
me
thetis
thou
art
my
bride
given
me
by
him
who
is
highest
amongst
the
gods
and
if
thou
wilt
come
with
me
thou
wilt
always
be
loved
and
reverenced
by
unwillingly
i
leave
the
sea
she
cried
unwillingly
i
go
with
thee
but
life
in
the
sea
was
not
for
her
any
more
now
that
she
was
mastered
she
went
to
peleus
s
ship
and
she
went
to
phthia
his
country
and
when
the
hero
and
the
sea
goddess
were
wedded
the
immortal
gods
and
goddesses
came
to
their
hall
and
brought
the
bride
and
the
bridegroom
wondrous
gifts
the
three
sisters
who
are
called
the
fates
came
also
these
wise
and
ancient
women
said
that
the
son
born
of
the
marriage
of
peleus
and
thetis
would
be
a
man
greater
than
peleus
himself
iii
now
although
a
son
was
born
to
her
and
although
this
son
had
something
of
the
radiance
of
the
immortals
about
him
thetis
remained
forlorn
and
estranged
nothing
that
her
husband
did
was
pleasing
to
her
prince
peleus
was
in
fear
that
the
wildness
of
the
sea
would
break
out
in
her
and
that
some
great
harm
would
be
wrought
in
his
house
one
night
he
wakened
suddenly
he
saw
the
fire
upon
his
hearth
and
he
saw
a
figure
standing
by
the
fire
it
was
thetis
his
wife
the
fire
was
blazing
around
something
that
she
held
in
her
hands
and
while
she
stood
there
she
was
singing
to
herself
a
song
and
then
he
saw
what
thetis
held
in
her
hands
and
what
the
fire
was
blazing
around
it
was
the
child
achilles
prince
peleus
sprang
from
the
bed
and
caught
thetis
around
the
waist
and
lifted
her
and
the
child
away
from
the
blazing
fire
he
put
them
both
upon
the
bed
and
he
took
from
her
the
child
that
she
held
by
the
heel
his
heart
was
wild
within
him
for
the
thought
that
wildness
had
come
over
his
wife
and
that
she
was
bent
upon
destroying
their
child
but
thetis
looked
on
him
from
under
those
goddess
brows
of
hers
and
she
said
to
him
by
the
divine
power
that
i
still
possess
i
would
have
made
the
child
invulnerable
but
the
heel
by
which
i
held
him
has
not
been
endued
by
the
fire
and
in
that
place
some
day
he
may
be
stricken
all
that
the
fire
covered
is
invulnerable
and
no
weapon
that
strikes
there
can
destroy
his
life
his
heel
i
can
not
now
make
invulnerable
for
now
the
divine
power
is
gone
out
of
when
she
said
this
thetis
looked
full
upon
her
husband
and
never
had
she
seemed
so
unforgiving
as
she
was
then
all
the
divine
radiance
that
had
remained
with
her
was
gone
from
her
now
and
she
seemed
a
and
woman
and
when
peleus
saw
that
such
a
great
bitterness
faced
him
he
fled
from
his
house
he
traveled
far
from
his
own
land
and
first
he
went
to
the
help
of
heracles
who
was
then
in
the
midst
of
his
mighty
labors
heracles
was
building
a
wall
around
a
city
peleus
labored
helping
him
to
raise
the
wall
for
king
laomedon
then
one
night
as
he
walked
by
the
wall
he
had
helped
to
build
he
heard
voices
speaking
out
of
the
earth
and
one
voice
said
why
has
peleus
striven
so
hard
to
raise
a
wall
that
his
son
shall
fight
hard
to
overthrow
no
voice
replied
the
wall
was
built
and
peleus
departed
the
city
around
which
the
wall
was
built
was
the
great
city
of
troy
in
whatever
place
he
went
peleus
was
followed
by
the
hatred
of
the
people
of
the
sea
and
above
all
by
the
hatred
of
the
nymph
who
is
called
psamathe
far
far
from
his
own
country
he
went
and
at
last
he
came
to
a
country
of
bright
valleys
that
was
ruled
over
by
a
kindly
ceyx
who
was
called
the
son
of
the
morning
star
bright
of
face
and
kindly
and
peaceable
in
all
his
ways
was
this
king
and
kindly
and
peaceable
was
the
land
that
he
ruled
over
and
when
prince
peleus
went
to
him
to
beg
for
his
protection
and
to
beg
for
unfurrowed
fields
where
he
might
graze
his
cattle
ceyx
raised
him
up
from
where
he
knelt
peaceable
and
plentiful
is
the
land
he
said
and
all
who
come
here
may
have
peace
and
a
chance
to
earn
their
food
live
where
you
will
o
stranger
and
take
the
unfurrowed
fields
by
the
seashore
for
pasture
for
your
peace
came
into
peleus
s
heart
as
he
looked
into
the
untroubled
face
of
ceyx
and
as
he
looked
over
the
bright
valleys
of
the
land
he
had
come
into
he
brought
his
cattle
to
the
unfurrowed
fields
by
the
seashore
and
he
left
herdsmen
there
to
tend
them
and
as
he
walked
along
these
bright
valleys
he
thought
upon
his
wife
and
upon
his
son
achilles
and
there
were
gentle
feelings
in
his
breast
but
then
he
thought
upon
the
enmity
of
psamathe
the
woman
of
the
sea
and
great
trouble
came
over
him
again
he
felt
he
could
not
stay
in
the
palace
of
the
kindly
king
he
went
where
his
herdsmen
camped
and
he
lived
with
them
but
the
sea
was
very
near
and
its
sound
tormented
him
and
as
the
days
went
by
peleus
wild
looking
and
shaggy
became
more
and
more
unlike
the
hero
whom
once
the
gods
themselves
had
honored
one
day
as
he
was
standing
near
the
palace
having
speech
with
the
king
a
herdsman
ran
to
him
and
cried
out
peleus
peleus
a
dread
thing
has
happened
in
the
unfurrowed
and
when
he
had
got
his
breath
the
herdsman
told
of
the
thing
that
had
happened
they
had
brought
the
herd
down
to
the
sea
suddenly
from
the
marshes
where
the
sea
and
land
came
together
a
monstrous
beast
rushed
out
upon
the
herd
like
a
wolf
this
beast
was
but
with
mouth
and
jaws
that
were
more
terrible
than
a
wolf
s
even
the
beast
seized
upon
the
cattle
yet
it
was
not
hunger
that
made
it
fierce
for
the
beasts
that
it
killed
it
tore
but
did
not
devour
it
rushed
on
and
on
killing
and
tearing
more
and
more
of
the
herd
soon
said
the
herdsman
it
will
have
destroyed
all
in
the
herd
and
then
it
will
not
spare
to
destroy
the
other
flocks
and
herds
that
are
in
the
peleus
was
stricken
to
hear
that
his
herd
was
being
destroyed
but
more
stricken
to
know
that
the
land
of
a
friendly
king
would
be
ravaged
and
ravaged
on
his
account
for
he
knew
that
the
terrible
beast
that
had
come
from
where
the
sea
and
the
land
joined
had
been
sent
by
psamathe
he
went
up
on
the
tower
that
stood
near
the
king
s
palace
he
was
able
to
look
out
on
the
sea
and
able
to
look
over
all
the
land
and
looking
across
the
bright
valleys
he
saw
the
dread
beast
he
saw
it
rush
through
his
own
mangled
cattle
and
fall
upon
the
herds
of
the
kindly
king
he
looked
toward
the
sea
and
he
prayed
to
psamathe
to
spare
the
land
that
he
had
come
to
but
even
as
he
prayed
he
knew
that
psamathe
would
not
harken
to
him
then
he
made
a
prayer
to
thetis
to
his
wife
who
had
seemed
so
unforgiving
he
prayed
her
to
deal
with
psamathe
so
that
the
land
of
ceyx
would
not
be
altogether
destroyed
as
he
looked
from
the
tower
he
saw
the
king
come
forth
with
arms
in
his
hands
for
the
slaying
of
the
terrible
beast
peleus
felt
fear
for
the
life
of
the
kindly
king
down
from
the
tower
he
came
and
taking
up
his
spear
he
went
with
ceyx
soon
in
one
of
the
brightest
of
the
valleys
they
came
upon
the
beast
they
came
between
it
and
a
herd
of
cattle
seeing
the
men
it
rushed
toward
them
with
blood
and
foam
upon
its
jaws
then
peleus
knew
that
the
spears
they
carried
would
be
of
little
use
against
the
raging
beast
his
only
thought
was
to
struggle
with
it
so
that
the
king
might
be
able
to
save
himself
again
he
lifted
up
his
hands
and
prayed
to
thetis
to
draw
away
psamathe
s
enmity
the
beast
rushed
toward
them
but
suddenly
it
stopped
the
bristles
upon
its
body
seemed
to
stiffen
the
gaping
jaws
became
fixed
the
hounds
that
were
with
them
dashed
upon
the
beast
but
then
fell
back
with
yelps
of
disappointment
and
when
peleus
and
ceyx
came
to
where
it
stood
they
found
that
the
monstrous
beast
had
been
turned
into
stone
and
a
stone
it
remains
in
that
bright
valley
a
wonder
to
all
the
men
of
ceyx
s
land
the
country
was
spared
the
ravages
of
the
beast
and
the
heart
of
peleus
was
uplifted
to
think
that
thetis
had
harkened
to
his
prayer
and
had
prevailed
upon
psamathe
to
forego
her
enmity
not
altogether
unforgiving
was
his
wife
to
him
that
day
he
went
from
the
land
of
the
bright
valleys
from
the
land
ruled
over
by
the
kindly
ceyx
and
he
came
back
to
rugged
phthia
his
own
country
when
he
came
near
his
hall
he
saw
two
at
the
doorway
awaiting
him
thetis
stood
there
and
the
child
achilles
was
by
her
side
the
radiance
of
the
immortals
was
in
her
face
no
longer
but
there
was
a
glow
there
a
glow
of
welcome
for
the
hero
peleus
and
thus
peleus
long
tormented
by
the
enmity
of
the
ones
came
back
to
the
wife
he
had
won
from
the
sea
iii
theseus
and
the
minotaur
i
decorative
first
letter
theseus
made
up
his
mind
to
go
in
search
of
his
father
the
unknown
king
and
medea
the
wise
woman
counseled
him
to
go
to
athens
after
the
hunt
in
calydon
he
set
forth
on
his
way
he
fought
with
and
slew
two
robbers
who
harassed
countries
and
treated
people
unjustly
the
first
was
sinnias
he
was
a
robber
who
slew
men
cruelly
by
tying
them
to
strong
branches
of
trees
and
letting
the
branches
fly
apart
on
him
theseus
had
no
mercy
the
second
was
a
robber
also
procrustes
he
had
a
great
iron
bed
on
which
he
made
his
captives
lie
if
they
were
too
long
for
that
bed
he
chopped
pieces
off
them
and
if
they
were
too
short
he
stretched
out
their
bodies
with
terrible
racks
on
him
likewise
theseus
had
no
mercy
he
slew
procrustes
and
gave
liberty
to
his
captives
the
king
of
athens
at
the
time
was
named
ægeus
he
was
father
of
theseus
but
neither
theseus
nor
he
knew
that
this
was
so
æthra
was
his
mother
and
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
trœzen
before
theseus
was
born
his
father
left
a
great
sword
under
a
stone
telling
æthra
that
the
boy
was
to
have
the
sword
when
he
was
able
to
move
that
stone
away
king
ægeus
was
old
and
fearful
now
there
were
wars
and
troubles
in
the
city
besides
there
was
in
his
palace
an
evil
woman
a
witch
to
whom
the
king
listened
this
woman
heard
that
a
proud
and
fearless
young
man
had
come
into
athens
and
she
at
once
thought
to
destroy
him
so
the
witch
spoke
to
the
fearful
king
and
she
made
him
believe
that
this
stranger
had
come
into
athens
to
make
league
with
his
enemies
and
destroy
him
such
was
her
power
over
ægeus
that
she
was
able
to
persuade
him
to
invite
the
stranger
youth
to
a
feast
in
the
palace
and
to
give
him
a
cup
that
would
have
poison
in
it
theseus
came
to
the
palace
he
sat
down
to
the
banquet
with
the
king
but
before
the
cup
was
brought
something
moved
him
to
stand
up
and
draw
forth
the
sword
that
he
carried
fearfully
the
king
looked
upon
the
sword
then
he
saw
the
heavy
ivory
hilt
with
the
curious
carving
on
it
and
he
knew
that
this
was
the
sword
that
he
had
once
laid
under
the
stone
near
the
palace
of
the
king
of
trœzen
he
questioned
theseus
as
to
how
he
had
come
by
the
sword
and
theseus
told
him
how
æthra
his
mother
had
shown
him
where
it
was
hidden
and
how
he
had
been
able
to
take
it
from
under
the
stone
before
he
was
grown
a
youth
more
and
more
ægeus
questioned
him
and
he
came
to
know
that
the
youth
before
him
was
his
son
indeed
he
dashed
down
the
cup
that
had
been
brought
to
the
table
and
he
shook
all
over
with
the
thought
of
how
near
he
had
been
to
a
terrible
crime
the
witchwoman
watched
all
that
passed
mounting
on
a
car
drawn
by
dragons
she
made
flight
from
athens
and
now
the
people
of
the
city
knowing
that
it
was
he
who
had
slain
the
robbers
sinnias
and
procrustes
rejoiced
to
have
theseus
amongst
them
when
he
appeared
as
their
prince
they
rejoiced
still
more
soon
he
was
able
to
bring
to
an
end
the
wars
in
the
city
and
the
troubles
that
afflicted
athens
ii
the
greatest
king
in
the
world
at
that
time
was
minos
king
of
crete
minos
had
sent
his
son
to
athens
to
make
peace
and
friendship
between
his
kingdom
and
the
kingdom
of
king
ægeus
but
the
people
of
athens
slew
the
son
of
king
minos
and
because
ægeus
had
not
given
him
the
protection
that
a
king
should
have
given
a
stranger
come
upon
such
an
errand
he
was
deemed
to
have
some
part
in
the
guilt
of
his
slaying
minos
the
great
king
was
wroth
and
he
made
war
on
athens
wreaking
great
destruction
upon
the
country
and
the
people
moreover
the
gods
themselves
were
wroth
with
athens
they
punished
the
people
with
famine
making
even
the
rivers
dry
up
the
athenians
went
to
the
oracle
and
asked
apollo
what
they
should
do
to
have
their
guilt
taken
away
apollo
made
answer
that
they
should
make
peace
with
minos
and
fulfill
all
his
demands
all
this
theseus
now
heard
learning
for
the
first
time
that
behind
the
wars
and
troubles
in
athens
there
was
a
deed
of
evil
that
ægeus
his
father
had
some
guilt
in
the
demands
that
king
minos
made
upon
athens
were
terrible
he
demanded
that
the
athenians
should
send
into
crete
every
year
seven
youths
and
seven
maidens
as
a
price
for
the
life
of
his
son
and
these
youths
and
maidens
were
not
to
meet
death
merely
nor
were
they
to
be
reared
in
were
to
be
sent
that
a
monster
called
the
minotaur
might
devour
them
youths
and
maidens
had
been
sent
and
for
the
third
time
the
messengers
of
king
minos
were
coming
to
athens
the
tribute
for
the
minotaur
was
to
be
chosen
by
lot
the
fathers
and
mothers
were
in
fear
and
trembling
for
each
man
and
woman
thought
that
his
or
her
son
or
daughter
would
be
taken
for
a
prey
for
the
minotaur
they
came
together
the
people
of
athens
and
they
drew
the
lots
fearfully
and
on
the
throne
above
them
all
sat
their
king
ægeus
the
father
of
theseus
before
the
first
lot
was
drawn
theseus
turned
to
all
of
them
and
said
people
of
athens
it
is
not
right
that
your
children
should
go
and
that
i
who
am
the
son
of
king
ægeus
should
remain
behind
surely
if
any
of
the
youths
of
athens
should
face
the
dread
monster
of
crete
i
should
face
it
there
is
one
lot
that
you
may
leave
undrawn
i
will
go
to
his
father
on
hearing
the
speech
of
theseus
came
down
from
his
throne
and
pleaded
with
him
begging
him
not
to
go
but
the
will
of
theseus
was
set
he
would
go
with
the
others
and
face
the
minotaur
and
he
reminded
his
father
of
how
the
people
had
complained
saying
that
if
ægeus
had
done
the
duty
of
a
king
minos
s
son
would
not
have
been
slain
and
the
tribute
to
the
minotaur
would
have
not
been
demanded
it
was
the
passing
about
of
such
complaints
that
had
led
to
the
war
and
troubles
that
theseus
found
on
his
coming
to
athens
also
theseus
told
his
father
and
told
the
people
that
he
had
hope
in
his
the
hands
that
were
strong
enough
to
slay
sinnias
and
procrustes
the
giant
robbers
would
be
strong
enough
to
slay
the
dread
monster
of
crete
his
father
at
last
consented
to
his
going
and
theseus
was
able
to
make
the
people
willing
to
believe
that
he
would
be
able
to
overcome
the
minotaur
and
so
put
an
end
to
the
terrible
tribute
that
was
being
exacted
from
them
with
six
other
youths
and
seven
maidens
theseus
went
on
board
of
the
ship
that
every
year
brought
to
crete
the
grievous
tribute
this
ship
always
sailed
with
black
sails
but
before
it
sailed
this
time
king
ægeus
gave
to
nausitheus
the
master
of
the
ship
a
white
sail
to
take
with
him
and
he
begged
theseus
that
in
case
he
should
be
able
to
overcome
the
monster
to
hoist
the
white
sail
he
had
given
theseus
promised
he
would
do
this
his
father
would
watch
for
the
return
of
the
ship
and
if
the
sail
were
black
he
would
know
that
the
minotaur
had
dealt
with
his
son
as
it
had
dealt
with
the
other
youths
who
had
gone
from
athens
and
if
the
sail
were
white
ægeus
would
have
indeed
cause
to
rejoice
iii
and
now
the
ship
had
come
to
crete
and
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
looked
from
its
deck
on
knossos
the
marvelous
city
that
dædalus
the
builder
had
built
for
king
minos
and
they
saw
the
palace
of
the
king
the
red
and
black
palace
in
which
was
the
labyrinth
made
also
by
dædalus
where
the
dread
minotaur
was
hidden
in
fear
they
looked
upon
the
city
and
the
palace
but
not
in
fear
did
theseus
look
but
in
wonder
at
the
magnificence
of
it
harbor
with
its
great
steps
leading
up
into
the
city
the
palace
all
red
and
black
and
the
crowds
of
ships
with
their
white
and
red
sails
they
were
brought
through
the
city
of
knossos
to
the
palace
of
the
king
and
there
theseus
looked
upon
minos
in
a
great
red
chamber
on
which
was
painted
the
sign
of
the
axe
king
minos
sat
on
a
low
throne
he
sat
holding
in
his
hand
a
scepter
on
which
a
bird
was
perched
not
in
fear
but
steadily
did
theseus
look
upon
the
king
and
he
saw
that
minos
had
the
face
of
one
who
has
thought
long
upon
troublesome
things
and
that
his
eyes
were
strangely
dark
and
deep
the
king
noted
that
the
eyes
of
theseus
were
upon
him
and
he
made
a
sign
with
his
head
to
an
attendant
and
the
attendant
laid
his
hand
upon
him
and
brought
theseus
to
stand
beside
the
king
minos
questioned
him
as
to
who
he
was
and
what
lands
he
had
been
in
and
when
he
learned
that
theseus
was
the
son
of
ægeus
the
king
of
athens
he
said
the
name
of
his
son
who
had
been
slain
androgeus
androgeus
over
and
over
again
and
then
spoke
no
more
while
he
stood
there
beside
the
king
there
came
into
the
chamber
three
maidens
one
of
them
theseus
knew
was
the
daughter
of
minos
not
like
the
maidens
of
greece
were
the
princess
and
her
two
attendants
instead
of
having
on
flowing
garments
and
sandals
and
wearing
their
hair
bound
they
had
on
dresses
of
gleaming
material
that
were
tight
at
the
waists
and
the
hair
that
streamed
on
their
shoulders
was
made
wavy
they
had
on
high
shoes
of
a
substance
that
shone
like
glass
never
had
theseus
looked
upon
maidens
who
were
so
strange
they
spoke
to
the
king
in
the
strange
cretan
language
then
minos
s
daughter
made
reverence
to
her
father
and
they
went
from
the
chamber
theseus
watched
them
as
they
went
through
a
long
passage
walking
slowly
on
their
shoes
through
the
same
passage
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
were
afterward
brought
they
came
into
a
great
hall
the
walls
were
red
and
on
them
were
paintings
in
of
great
bulls
with
girls
and
slender
youths
struggling
with
them
it
was
a
place
for
games
and
shows
and
theseus
stood
with
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
and
with
the
people
of
the
palace
and
watched
what
was
happening
they
saw
women
charming
snakes
then
they
saw
a
boxing
match
and
afterward
they
all
looked
on
a
bout
of
wrestling
theseus
looked
past
the
wrestlers
and
he
saw
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
the
daughter
of
king
minos
and
her
two
attendant
maidens
one
and
bearded
man
overthrew
all
the
wrestlers
who
came
to
grips
with
him
he
stood
there
boastfully
and
theseus
was
made
angry
by
the
man
s
arrogance
then
when
no
other
wrestler
would
come
against
him
he
turned
to
leave
the
arena
but
theseus
stood
in
his
way
and
pushed
him
back
the
boastful
man
laid
hands
upon
him
and
pulled
him
into
the
arena
he
strove
to
throw
theseus
as
he
had
thrown
the
others
but
he
soon
found
that
the
youth
from
greece
was
a
wrestler
too
and
that
he
would
have
to
strive
hard
to
overthrow
him
illustration
more
eagerly
than
they
had
watched
anything
else
the
people
of
the
palace
and
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
watched
the
bout
between
theseus
and
the
lordly
wrestler
those
from
athens
who
looked
upon
him
now
thought
that
they
had
never
seen
theseus
look
so
tall
and
so
conquering
before
beside
the
slender
people
of
crete
he
looked
like
a
statue
of
one
of
the
gods
very
adroit
was
the
cretan
wrestler
and
theseus
had
to
use
all
his
strength
to
keep
upon
his
feet
but
soon
he
mastered
the
tricks
that
the
wrestler
was
using
against
him
then
the
cretan
left
aside
his
tricks
and
began
to
use
all
his
strength
to
throw
theseus
steadily
theseus
stood
and
the
cretan
wrestler
was
spent
and
gasping
in
the
effort
to
throw
him
then
theseus
made
him
feel
his
grip
he
bent
him
backward
and
then
using
all
his
strength
suddenly
forced
him
to
the
ground
all
were
filled
with
wonder
at
the
strength
and
power
of
this
youth
from
overseas
food
and
wine
were
given
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
and
they
with
theseus
were
let
wander
through
the
grounds
of
the
palace
but
they
could
make
no
escape
for
guards
followed
them
and
the
way
to
the
ships
was
filled
with
strangers
who
would
not
let
them
pass
they
talked
to
each
other
about
the
minotaur
and
there
was
fear
in
every
word
they
said
but
theseus
went
from
one
to
the
other
telling
them
that
perhaps
there
was
a
way
by
which
he
could
come
to
the
monster
and
destroy
it
and
the
youths
and
maidens
remembering
how
he
had
overthrown
the
lordly
wrestler
were
comforted
a
little
thinking
that
theseus
might
indeed
be
able
to
destroy
the
minotaur
and
so
save
all
of
them
iv
theseus
was
awakened
by
some
one
touching
him
he
arose
and
he
saw
a
servant
who
beckoned
to
him
he
left
the
little
chamber
where
he
had
been
sleeping
and
then
he
saw
outside
one
who
wore
the
strange
dress
of
the
cretans
when
theseus
looked
full
upon
her
he
saw
that
she
was
none
other
than
the
daughter
of
king
minos
i
am
ariadne
she
said
and
o
youth
from
greece
i
have
come
to
save
you
from
the
dread
he
looked
upon
ariadne
s
strange
face
with
its
long
dark
eyes
and
he
wondered
how
this
girl
could
think
that
she
could
save
him
and
save
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
from
the
minotaur
her
hand
rested
upon
his
arm
and
she
led
him
into
the
chamber
where
minos
had
sat
it
was
lighted
now
by
many
little
lamps
i
will
show
the
way
of
escape
to
you
said
ariadne
then
theseus
looked
around
and
he
saw
that
none
of
the
other
youths
and
maidens
were
near
them
and
he
looked
on
ariadne
again
and
he
saw
that
the
strange
princess
had
been
won
to
help
him
and
to
help
him
only
who
will
show
the
way
of
escape
to
the
others
asked
theseus
ah
said
the
princess
ariadne
for
the
others
there
is
no
way
of
then
said
theseus
i
will
not
leave
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
who
came
with
me
to
crete
to
be
devoured
by
the
ah
theseus
said
ariadne
they
can
not
escape
the
minotaur
one
only
may
escape
and
i
want
you
to
be
that
one
i
saw
you
when
you
wrestled
with
deucalion
our
great
wrestler
and
since
then
i
have
longed
to
save
i
have
come
to
slay
the
minotaur
said
theseus
and
i
can
not
hold
my
life
as
my
own
until
i
have
slain
said
ariadne
if
you
could
see
the
minotaur
theseus
and
if
you
could
measure
its
power
you
would
know
that
you
are
not
the
one
to
slay
it
i
think
that
only
talos
that
giant
who
was
all
of
bronze
could
have
slain
the
princess
said
theseus
can
you
help
me
to
come
to
the
minotaur
and
look
upon
it
so
that
i
can
know
for
certainty
whether
this
hand
of
mine
can
slay
the
monster
i
can
help
you
to
come
to
the
minotaur
and
look
upon
it
said
ariadne
then
help
me
princess
cried
theseus
help
me
to
come
to
the
minotaur
and
look
upon
it
and
help
me
too
to
get
back
the
sword
that
i
brought
with
me
to
your
sword
will
not
avail
you
against
the
minotaur
said
ariadne
when
you
look
upon
the
monster
you
will
know
that
it
is
not
for
your
hand
to
oh
but
bring
me
my
sword
princess
cried
theseus
and
his
hands
went
out
to
her
in
supplication
i
will
bring
you
your
sword
said
she
she
took
up
a
little
lamp
and
went
through
a
doorway
leaving
theseus
standing
by
the
low
throne
in
the
chamber
of
minos
then
after
a
little
while
she
came
back
bringing
with
her
theseus
s
great
sword
it
is
a
great
sword
she
said
i
marked
it
before
because
it
is
your
sword
theseus
but
even
this
great
sword
will
not
avail
against
the
show
me
the
way
to
come
to
the
minotaur
o
ariadne
cried
theseus
he
knew
that
she
did
not
think
that
he
would
deem
himself
able
to
strive
with
the
minotaur
and
that
when
he
looked
upon
the
dread
monster
he
would
return
to
her
and
then
take
the
way
of
his
escape
she
took
his
hand
and
led
him
from
the
chamber
of
minos
she
was
not
tall
but
she
stood
straight
and
walked
steadily
and
theseus
saw
in
her
something
of
the
strange
majesty
that
he
had
seen
in
minos
the
king
illustration
they
came
to
high
bronze
gates
that
opened
into
a
vault
here
said
ariadne
the
labyrinth
begins
very
devious
is
the
labyrinth
built
by
dædalus
in
which
the
minotaur
is
hidden
and
without
the
clue
none
could
find
a
way
through
the
passages
but
i
will
give
you
the
clue
so
that
you
may
look
upon
the
minotaur
and
then
come
back
to
me
theseus
now
i
put
into
your
hand
the
thread
that
will
guide
you
through
all
the
windings
of
the
labyrinth
and
outside
the
place
where
the
minotaur
is
you
will
find
another
thread
to
guide
you
a
cone
was
on
the
ground
and
it
had
a
thread
fastened
to
it
ariadne
gave
theseus
the
thread
and
the
cone
to
wind
it
around
the
thread
as
he
held
it
and
wound
it
around
the
cone
would
bring
him
through
all
the
windings
and
turnings
of
the
labyrinth
she
left
him
and
theseus
went
on
winding
the
thread
around
the
cone
he
went
along
a
wide
passage
in
the
vault
he
turned
and
came
into
a
passage
that
was
very
long
he
came
to
a
place
in
this
passage
where
a
door
seemed
to
be
but
within
the
frame
of
the
doorway
there
was
only
a
blank
wall
but
below
that
doorway
there
was
a
flight
of
six
steps
and
down
these
steps
the
thread
led
him
on
he
went
and
he
crossed
the
marks
that
he
himself
had
made
in
the
dust
and
he
thought
he
must
have
come
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
parted
from
ariadne
he
went
on
and
he
saw
before
him
a
flight
of
steps
the
thread
did
not
lead
up
the
steps
it
led
into
the
most
winding
of
passages
so
sudden
were
the
turnings
in
it
that
one
could
not
see
three
steps
before
one
he
was
dazed
by
the
turnings
of
this
passage
but
still
he
went
on
he
went
up
winding
steps
and
then
along
a
narrow
wall
the
wall
overhung
a
broad
flight
of
steps
and
theseus
had
to
jump
to
them
down
the
steps
he
went
and
into
a
wide
empty
hall
that
had
doorways
to
the
right
hand
and
to
the
left
hand
here
the
thread
had
its
end
it
was
fastened
to
a
cone
that
lay
on
the
ground
and
beside
this
cone
was
clue
that
was
to
bring
him
back
now
theseus
knowing
he
was
in
the
very
center
of
the
labyrinth
looked
all
around
for
sight
of
the
minotaur
there
was
no
sight
of
the
monster
here
he
went
to
all
the
doors
and
pushed
at
them
and
some
opened
and
some
remained
fast
the
middle
door
opened
as
it
did
theseus
felt
around
him
a
chilling
draft
of
air
that
chilling
draft
was
from
the
breathing
of
the
monster
theseus
then
saw
the
minotaur
it
lay
on
the
ground
a
strange
thing
when
the
thought
came
to
theseus
that
he
would
have
to
fight
that
monster
alone
and
in
that
hidden
and
empty
place
all
delight
left
him
he
grew
like
a
stone
he
groaned
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
the
voice
of
ariadne
calling
him
back
he
could
find
his
way
back
through
the
labyrinth
and
come
to
her
he
stepped
back
and
the
door
closed
on
the
minotaur
the
dread
monster
of
crete
in
an
instant
theseus
pushed
the
door
again
he
stood
within
the
hall
where
the
minotaur
was
and
the
heavy
door
shut
behind
him
he
looked
again
on
that
dark
thing
it
reared
up
as
a
horse
rears
and
theseus
saw
that
it
would
crash
down
on
him
and
tear
him
with
its
dragon
claws
with
a
great
bound
he
went
far
away
from
where
the
monster
crashed
down
then
theseus
faced
it
he
saw
its
thick
lips
and
its
slobbering
mouth
he
saw
that
its
skin
was
thick
and
hard
illustration
he
drew
near
the
monster
his
sword
in
his
hand
he
struck
at
its
eyes
and
his
sword
made
a
great
dint
but
no
blood
came
for
the
minotaur
was
a
bloodless
monster
from
its
mouth
and
nostrils
came
a
draft
that
covered
him
with
a
chilling
slime
then
it
rushed
upon
him
and
overthrew
him
and
theseus
felt
its
terrible
weight
upon
him
but
he
thrust
his
sword
upward
and
it
reared
up
again
screaming
with
pain
theseus
drew
himself
away
and
then
he
saw
it
searching
around
and
around
and
he
knew
he
had
made
it
sightless
then
it
faced
him
all
the
more
fearful
it
was
because
from
its
wounds
no
blood
came
anger
flowed
into
theseus
when
he
saw
the
monster
standing
frightfully
before
him
he
thought
of
all
the
youths
and
maidens
that
this
bloodless
thing
had
destroyed
and
all
the
youths
and
maidens
that
it
would
destroy
if
he
did
not
slay
it
now
angrily
he
rushed
upon
it
with
his
great
sword
it
clawed
and
tore
him
and
it
opened
wide
its
most
evil
mouth
as
if
to
draw
him
into
it
but
again
he
sprang
at
it
he
thrust
his
great
sword
through
its
neck
and
he
left
his
sword
there
with
the
last
of
his
strength
he
pulled
open
the
heavy
door
and
he
went
out
from
the
hall
where
the
minotaur
was
he
picked
up
the
thread
and
he
began
to
wind
it
as
he
had
wound
the
other
thread
on
his
way
down
on
he
went
through
passage
after
passage
through
chamber
after
chamber
his
mind
was
dizzy
and
he
had
little
thought
for
the
way
he
was
going
his
wounds
and
the
chill
that
the
monster
had
breathed
into
him
and
his
horror
of
the
fearful
and
bloodless
thing
made
his
mind
almost
forsake
him
he
kept
the
thread
in
his
hand
and
he
wound
it
as
he
went
on
through
the
labyrinth
he
stumbled
and
the
thread
broke
he
went
on
for
a
few
steps
and
then
he
went
back
to
find
the
thread
that
had
fallen
out
of
his
hands
in
an
instant
he
was
in
a
part
of
the
labyrinth
that
he
had
not
been
in
before
he
walked
a
long
way
and
then
he
came
on
his
own
footmarks
as
they
crossed
themselves
in
the
dust
he
pushed
open
a
door
and
came
into
the
air
he
was
now
by
the
outside
wall
of
the
palace
and
he
saw
birds
flying
by
him
he
leant
against
the
wall
of
the
palace
thinking
that
he
would
strive
no
more
to
find
his
way
through
the
labyrinth
v
that
day
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
were
brought
through
the
labyrinth
and
to
the
hall
where
the
minotaur
was
they
went
through
the
passages
weeping
and
lamenting
some
cried
out
for
theseus
and
some
said
that
theseus
had
deserted
them
the
heavy
door
was
opened
then
those
who
were
with
the
youths
and
maidens
saw
the
minotaur
lying
stark
and
stiff
with
theseus
s
sword
through
its
neck
they
shouted
and
blew
trumpets
and
the
noise
of
their
trumpets
filled
the
labyrinth
then
they
turned
back
bringing
the
youths
and
maidens
with
them
and
a
whisper
went
through
the
whole
palace
that
the
minotaur
had
been
slain
the
youths
and
maidens
were
lodged
in
the
chamber
where
minos
gave
his
judgments
vi
theseus
wearied
and
overcome
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
by
the
wall
of
the
palace
he
awakened
with
a
feeling
that
the
claw
of
the
minotaur
was
upon
him
there
were
stars
in
the
sky
above
the
high
palace
wall
and
he
saw
a
and
ancient
man
standing
beside
him
theseus
knew
that
this
was
dædalus
the
builder
of
the
palace
and
the
labyrinth
dædalus
called
and
a
slim
youth
the
son
of
dædalus
minos
had
set
father
and
son
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
palace
and
theseus
had
come
near
the
place
where
they
were
confined
icarus
came
and
brought
him
to
a
winding
stairway
and
showed
him
a
way
to
go
a
servant
met
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
then
as
if
he
knew
that
theseus
was
the
one
whom
he
had
been
searching
for
he
led
him
into
a
little
chamber
where
there
were
three
maidens
one
started
up
and
came
to
him
quickly
and
theseus
again
saw
ariadne
she
hid
him
in
the
chamber
of
the
palace
where
her
singing
birds
were
and
she
would
come
and
sit
beside
him
asking
about
his
own
country
and
telling
him
that
she
would
go
with
him
there
i
showed
you
how
you
might
come
to
the
minotaur
she
said
and
you
went
there
and
you
slew
the
monster
and
now
i
may
not
stay
in
my
father
s
and
theseus
thought
all
the
time
of
his
return
and
of
how
he
might
bring
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
back
to
their
own
people
for
ariadne
that
strange
princess
was
not
dear
to
him
as
medea
was
dear
to
jason
or
atalanta
the
huntress
to
young
meleagrus
one
sunset
she
led
him
to
a
roof
of
the
palace
and
she
showed
him
the
harbor
with
the
ships
and
she
showed
him
the
ship
with
the
black
sail
that
had
brought
him
to
knossos
she
told
him
she
would
take
him
aboard
that
ship
and
that
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
could
go
with
them
she
would
bring
to
the
master
of
the
ship
the
seal
of
king
minos
and
the
master
seeing
it
would
set
sail
for
whatever
place
theseus
desired
to
go
then
did
she
become
dear
to
theseus
because
of
her
great
kindness
and
he
kissed
her
eyes
and
swore
that
he
would
not
go
from
the
palace
unless
she
would
come
with
him
to
his
own
country
the
strange
princess
smiled
and
wept
as
if
she
doubted
what
he
said
nevertheless
she
led
him
from
the
roof
and
down
into
one
of
the
palace
gardens
he
waited
there
and
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
were
led
into
the
garden
all
wearing
cloaks
that
hid
their
forms
and
faces
young
icarus
led
them
from
the
grounds
of
the
palace
and
down
to
the
ships
and
ariadne
went
with
them
bringing
with
her
the
seal
of
her
father
king
minos
and
when
they
came
on
board
of
the
ship
they
showed
the
seal
to
the
master
nausitheus
and
the
master
of
the
ship
let
the
sail
take
the
breeze
of
the
evening
and
so
theseus
went
away
from
crete
vii
to
the
island
of
naxos
they
sailed
and
when
they
reached
that
place
the
master
of
the
ship
thinking
that
what
had
been
done
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
king
minos
stayed
the
ship
there
he
waited
until
other
ships
came
from
knossos
and
when
they
came
they
brought
word
that
minos
would
not
slay
nor
demand
back
theseus
nor
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
his
daughter
ariadne
he
would
have
back
to
reign
with
him
over
crete
then
ariadne
left
the
ship
and
went
back
to
crete
from
naxos
theseus
let
the
princess
go
although
he
might
have
struggled
to
hold
her
but
more
strange
than
dear
did
ariadne
remain
to
theseus
and
all
this
time
his
father
ægeus
stayed
on
the
tower
of
his
palace
watching
for
the
return
of
the
ship
that
had
sailed
for
knossos
the
life
of
the
king
wasted
since
the
departure
of
theseus
and
now
it
was
but
a
thread
every
day
he
watched
for
the
return
of
the
ship
hoping
against
hope
that
theseus
would
return
alive
to
him
then
a
ship
came
into
the
harbor
it
had
black
sails
ægeus
did
not
know
that
theseus
was
aboard
of
it
and
that
theseus
in
the
hurry
of
his
flight
and
in
the
sadness
of
his
parting
from
ariadne
had
not
thought
of
taking
out
the
white
sail
that
his
father
had
given
to
nausitheus
joyously
theseus
sailed
into
the
harbor
having
slain
the
minotaur
and
lifted
for
ever
the
tribute
put
upon
athens
joyously
he
sailed
into
the
harbor
bringing
back
to
their
parents
the
youths
and
maidens
of
athens
but
the
king
his
father
saw
the
black
sails
on
his
ship
and
straightway
the
thread
of
his
life
broke
and
he
died
on
the
roof
of
the
tower
which
he
had
built
to
look
out
on
the
sea
theseus
landed
on
the
shore
of
his
own
country
he
had
the
ship
drawn
up
on
the
beach
and
he
made
sacrifices
of
thanksgiving
to
the
gods
then
he
sent
messengers
to
the
city
to
announce
his
return
they
went
toward
the
city
these
joyful
messengers
but
when
they
came
to
the
gate
they
heard
the
sounds
of
mourning
and
lamentation
the
mourning
and
the
lamentation
were
for
the
death
of
the
king
theseus
s
father
they
hurried
back
and
they
came
to
theseus
where
he
stood
on
the
beach
they
brought
a
wreath
of
victory
for
him
but
as
they
put
it
into
his
hand
they
told
him
of
the
death
of
his
father
then
theseus
left
the
wreath
on
the
ground
and
he
wept
for
the
death
of
ægeus
the
hero
who
had
left
the
sword
under
the
stone
for
him
before
he
was
born
the
men
and
women
who
came
to
the
beach
wept
and
laughed
as
they
clasped
in
their
arms
the
children
brought
back
to
them
and
theseus
stood
there
silent
and
bowed
the
memory
of
his
last
moments
with
his
father
of
his
fight
with
the
minotaur
of
his
parting
with
flowed
back
upon
him
he
stood
there
with
head
bowed
the
man
who
might
not
put
upon
his
brows
the
wreath
of
victory
that
had
been
brought
to
him
illustration
viii
there
had
come
into
the
city
a
youth
of
great
valor
whose
name
was
peirithous
from
a
far
country
he
had
come
filled
with
a
desire
of
meeting
theseus
whose
fame
had
come
to
him
the
youth
was
in
athens
at
the
time
theseus
returned
he
went
down
to
the
beach
with
the
townsfolk
and
he
saw
theseus
standing
alone
with
his
head
bowed
down
he
went
to
him
and
he
spoke
and
theseus
lifted
his
head
and
he
saw
before
him
a
young
man
of
strength
and
beauty
he
looked
upon
him
and
the
thought
of
high
deeds
came
into
his
mind
again
he
wanted
this
young
man
to
be
his
comrade
in
dangers
and
upon
quests
and
peirithous
looked
upon
theseus
and
he
felt
that
he
was
greater
and
nobler
than
he
had
thought
they
became
friends
and
sworn
brothers
and
together
they
went
into
far
countries
now
there
was
in
epirus
a
savage
king
who
had
a
very
fair
daughter
he
had
named
this
daughter
persephone
naming
her
thus
to
show
that
she
was
held
as
fast
by
him
as
that
other
persephone
was
held
who
ruled
in
the
underworld
no
man
might
see
her
and
no
man
might
wed
her
but
peirithous
had
seen
the
daughter
of
this
king
and
he
desired
above
all
things
to
take
her
from
her
father
and
make
her
his
wife
he
begged
theseus
to
help
him
enter
that
king
s
palace
and
carry
off
the
maiden
so
they
came
to
epirus
theseus
and
peirithous
and
they
entered
the
king
s
palace
and
they
heard
the
bay
of
the
dread
hound
that
was
there
to
let
no
one
out
who
had
once
come
within
the
walls
suddenly
the
guards
of
the
savage
king
came
upon
them
and
they
took
theseus
and
peirithous
and
they
dragged
them
down
into
dark
dungeons
two
great
chairs
of
stone
were
there
and
theseus
and
peirithous
were
left
seated
in
them
and
the
magic
powers
that
were
in
the
chairs
of
stone
were
such
that
the
heroes
could
not
lift
themselves
out
of
them
there
they
stayed
held
in
the
great
stone
chairs
in
the
dungeons
of
that
savage
king
then
it
so
happened
that
heracles
came
into
the
palace
of
the
king
the
harsh
king
feasted
heracles
and
abated
his
savagery
before
him
but
he
could
not
forbear
boasting
of
how
he
had
trapped
the
heroes
who
had
come
to
carry
off
persephone
and
he
told
how
they
could
not
get
out
of
the
stone
chairs
and
how
they
were
held
captive
in
his
dark
dungeon
heracles
listened
his
heart
full
of
pity
for
the
heroes
from
greece
who
had
met
with
such
a
harsh
fate
and
when
the
king
mentioned
that
one
of
the
heroes
was
theseus
heracles
would
feast
no
more
with
him
until
he
had
promised
that
the
one
who
had
been
his
comrade
on
the
would
be
let
go
the
king
said
he
would
give
theseus
his
liberty
if
heracles
would
carry
the
stone
chair
on
which
he
was
seated
out
of
the
dungeon
and
into
the
outer
world
then
heracles
went
down
into
the
dungeon
he
found
the
two
heroes
in
the
great
chairs
of
stone
but
one
of
them
peirithous
no
longer
breathed
heracles
took
the
great
chair
of
stone
that
theseus
was
seated
in
and
he
carried
it
up
up
from
the
dungeon
and
out
into
the
world
it
was
a
heavy
task
even
for
heracles
he
broke
the
chair
in
pieces
and
theseus
stood
up
released
thereafter
the
world
was
before
theseus
he
went
with
heracles
and
in
the
deeds
that
heracles
was
afterward
to
accomplish
theseus
shared

life
and
labors

decorative
first
letter
was
the
son
of
zeus
but
he
was
born
into
the
family
of
a
mortal
king
when
he
was
still
a
youth
being
overwhelmed
by
a
madness
sent
upon
him
by
one
of
the
goddesses
he
slew
the
children
of
his
brother
iphicles
then
coming
to
know
what
he
had
done
sleep
and
rest
went
from
him
he
went
to
delphi
to
the
shrine
of
apollo
to
be
purified
of
his
crime
at
delphi
at
the
shrine
of
apollo
the
priestess
purified
him
and
when
she
had
purified
him
she
uttered
this
prophecy
from
this
day
forth
thy
name
shall
be
not
alcides
but
heracles
thou
shalt
go
to
eurystheus
thy
cousin
in
mycenæ
and
serve
him
in
all
things
when
the
labors
he
shall
lay
upon
thee
are
accomplished
and
when
the
rest
of
thy
life
is
lived
out
thou
shalt
become
one
of
the
heracles
on
hearing
these
words
set
out
for
mycenæ
he
stood
before
his
cousin
who
hated
him
he
a
towering
man
stood
before
a
king
who
sat
there
weak
and
trembling
and
heracles
said
i
have
come
to
take
up
the
labors
that
you
will
lay
upon
me
speak
now
eurystheus
and
tell
me
what
you
would
have
me
eurystheus
that
weak
king
looking
on
the
young
man
who
stood
as
tall
and
as
firm
as
one
of
the
immortals
had
a
heart
that
was
filled
with
hatred
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
he
said
with
a
frown
there
is
a
lion
in
nemea
that
is
stronger
and
more
fierce
than
any
lion
known
before
kill
that
lion
and
bring
the
lion
s
skin
to
me
that
i
may
know
that
you
have
truly
performed
your
so
eurystheus
said
and
heracles
with
neither
shield
nor
arms
went
forth
from
the
king
s
palace
to
seek
and
to
combat
the
dread
lion
of
nemea
he
went
on
until
he
came
into
a
country
where
the
fences
were
overthrown
and
the
fields
wasted
and
the
houses
empty
and
fallen
he
went
on
until
he
came
to
the
waste
around
that
land
there
he
came
on
the
trail
of
the
lion
it
led
up
the
side
of
a
mountain
and
heracles
without
shield
or
arms
followed
the
trail
illustration
he
heard
the
roar
of
the
lion
looking
up
he
saw
the
beast
standing
at
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
huge
and
dark
against
the
sunset
the
lion
roared
three
times
and
then
it
went
within
the
cavern
around
the
mouth
were
strewn
the
bones
of
creatures
it
had
killed
and
carried
there
heracles
looked
upon
them
when
he
came
to
the
cavern
he
went
within
far
into
the
cavern
he
went
and
then
he
came
to
where
he
saw
the
lion
it
was
sleeping
heracles
viewed
the
terrible
bulk
of
the
lion
and
then
he
looked
upon
his
own
knotted
hands
and
arms
he
remembered
that
it
was
told
of
him
that
while
still
a
child
of
eight
months
he
had
strangled
a
great
serpent
that
had
come
to
his
cradle
to
devour
him
he
had
grown
and
his
strength
had
grown
too
so
he
stood
measuring
his
strength
and
the
size
of
the
lion
the
breath
from
its
mouth
and
nostrils
came
heavily
to
him
as
the
beast
slept
gorged
with
its
prey
then
the
lion
yawned
heracles
sprang
on
it
and
put
his
great
hands
upon
its
throat
no
growl
came
out
of
its
mouth
but
the
great
eyes
blazed
while
the
terrible
paws
tore
at
heracles
against
the
rock
heracles
held
the
beast
strongly
he
held
it
choking
it
through
the
skin
that
was
almost
impenetrable
terribly
the
lion
struggled
but
the
strong
hands
of
the
hero
held
around
its
throat
until
it
struggled
no
more
then
heracles
stripped
off
that
impenetrable
skin
from
the
lion
s
body
he
put
it
upon
himself
for
a
cloak
then
as
he
went
through
the
forest
he
pulled
up
a
young
oak
tree
and
trimmed
it
and
made
a
club
for
himself
with
the
lion
s
skin
over
skin
that
no
spear
or
arrow
could
carrying
the
club
in
his
hand
he
journeyed
on
until
he
came
to
the
palace
of
king
eurystheus
the
king
seeing
coming
toward
him
a
towering
man
all
covered
with
the
hide
of
a
monstrous
lion
ran
and
hid
himself
in
a
great
jar
he
lifted
the
lid
up
to
ask
the
servants
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
terrible
appearance
and
the
servants
told
him
that
it
was
heracles
come
back
with
the
skin
of
the
lion
of
nemea
on
hearing
this
eurystheus
hid
himself
again
he
would
not
speak
with
heracles
nor
have
him
come
near
him
so
fearful
was
he
but
heracles
was
content
to
be
left
alone
he
sat
down
in
the
palace
and
feasted
himself
the
servants
came
to
the
king
eurystheus
lifted
the
lid
of
the
jar
and
they
told
him
how
heracles
was
feasting
and
devouring
all
the
goods
in
the
palace
the
king
flew
into
a
rage
but
still
he
was
fearful
of
having
the
hero
before
him
he
issued
commands
through
his
heralds
ordering
heracles
to
go
forth
at
once
and
perform
the
second
of
his
tasks
it
was
to
slay
the
great
water
snake
that
made
its
lair
in
the
swamps
of
lerna
heracles
stayed
to
feast
another
day
and
then
with
the
lion
s
skin
across
his
shoulders
and
the
great
club
in
his
hands
he
started
off
but
this
time
he
did
not
go
alone
the
boy
iolaus
went
with
him
illustration
heracles
and
iolaus
went
on
until
they
came
to
the
vast
swamp
of
lerna
right
in
the
middle
of
the
swamp
was
the
water
snake
that
was
called
the
hydra
nine
heads
it
had
and
it
raised
them
up
out
of
the
water
as
the
hero
and
his
companion
came
near
they
could
not
cross
the
swamp
to
come
to
the
monster
for
man
or
beast
would
sink
and
be
lost
in
it
the
hydra
remained
in
the
middle
of
the
swamp
belching
mud
at
the
hero
and
his
companion
then
heracles
took
up
his
bow
and
he
shot
flaming
arrows
at
its
heads
it
grew
into
such
a
rage
that
it
came
through
the
swamp
to
attack
him
heracles
swung
his
club
as
the
hydra
came
near
he
knocked
head
after
head
off
its
body
but
for
every
head
knocked
off
two
grew
upon
the
hydra
and
as
he
struggled
with
the
monster
a
huge
crab
came
out
of
the
swamp
and
gripping
heracles
by
the
foot
tried
to
draw
him
in
then
heracles
cried
out
the
boy
iolaus
came
he
killed
the
crab
that
had
come
to
the
hydra
s
aid
then
heracles
laid
hands
upon
the
hydra
and
drew
it
out
of
the
swamp
with
his
club
he
knocked
off
a
head
and
he
had
iolaus
put
fire
to
where
it
had
been
so
that
two
heads
might
not
grow
in
that
place
the
life
of
the
hydra
was
in
its
middle
head
that
head
he
had
not
been
able
to
knock
off
with
his
club
now
with
his
hands
he
tore
it
off
and
he
placed
this
head
under
a
great
stone
so
that
it
could
not
rise
into
life
again
the
hydra
s
life
was
now
destroyed
heracles
dipped
his
arrows
into
the
gall
of
the
monster
making
his
arrows
deadly
no
thing
that
was
struck
by
these
arrows
afterward
could
keep
its
life
again
he
came
to
eurystheus
s
palace
and
eurystheus
seeing
him
ran
again
and
hid
himself
in
the
jar
heracles
ordered
the
servants
to
tell
the
king
that
he
had
returned
and
that
the
second
labor
was
accomplished
eurystheus
hearing
from
the
servants
that
heracles
was
mild
in
his
ways
came
out
of
the
jar
insolently
he
spoke
twelve
labors
you
have
to
accomplish
for
me
said
he
to
heracles
and
eleven
yet
remain
to
be
how
said
heracles
have
i
not
performed
two
of
the
labors
have
i
not
slain
the
lion
of
nemea
and
the
great
water
snake
of
lerna
in
the
killing
of
the
water
snake
you
were
helped
by
iolaus
said
the
king
snapping
out
his
words
and
looking
at
heracles
with
shifting
eyes
that
labor
can
not
be
allowed
heracles
would
have
struck
him
to
the
ground
but
then
he
remembered
that
the
crime
that
he
had
committed
in
his
madness
would
have
to
be
expiated
by
labors
performed
at
the
order
of
this
man
he
looked
full
upon
eurystheus
and
he
said
tell
me
of
the
other
labors
and
i
will
go
forth
from
mycenæ
and
accomplish
then
eurystheus
bade
him
go
and
make
clean
the
stables
of
king
augeias
heracles
came
into
that
king
s
country
the
smell
from
the
stables
was
felt
for
miles
around
countless
herds
of
cattle
and
goats
had
been
in
the
stables
for
years
and
because
of
the
uncleanness
and
the
smell
that
came
from
it
the
crops
were
withered
all
around
heracles
told
the
king
that
he
would
clean
the
stables
if
he
were
given
one
tenth
of
the
cattle
and
the
goats
for
a
reward
the
king
agreed
to
this
reward
then
heracles
drove
the
cattle
and
the
goats
out
of
the
stables
he
broke
through
the
foundations
and
he
made
channels
for
the
two
rivers
alpheus
and
peneius
the
waters
flowed
through
the
stables
and
in
a
day
all
the
uncleanness
was
washed
away
then
heracles
turned
the
rivers
back
into
their
own
courses
he
was
not
given
the
reward
he
had
bargained
for
however
he
went
back
to
mycenæ
with
the
tale
of
how
he
had
cleaned
the
stables
ten
labors
remain
for
me
to
do
now
he
said
eleven
said
eurystheus
how
can
i
allow
the
cleaning
of
king
augeias
s
stables
to
you
when
you
bargained
for
a
reward
for
doing
it
then
while
heracles
stood
still
holding
himself
back
from
striking
him
eurystheus
ran
away
and
hid
himself
in
the
jar
through
his
heralds
he
sent
word
to
heracles
telling
him
what
the
other
labors
would
be
he
was
to
clear
the
marshes
of
stymphalus
of
the
birds
that
gathered
there
he
was
to
capture
and
bring
to
the
king
the
deer
of
coryneia
he
was
also
to
capture
and
bring
alive
to
mycenæ
the
boar
of
erymanthus
heracles
came
to
the
marshes
of
stymphalus
the
growth
of
jungle
was
so
dense
that
he
could
not
cut
his
way
through
to
where
the
birds
were
they
sat
upon
low
bushes
within
the
jungle
gorging
themselves
upon
the
flesh
they
had
carried
there
for
days
heracles
tried
to
hack
his
way
through
he
could
not
get
to
where
the
birds
were
then
thinking
he
might
not
be
able
to
accomplish
this
labor
he
sat
upon
the
ground
in
despair
it
was
then
that
one
of
the
immortals
appeared
to
him
for
the
first
and
only
time
he
was
given
help
from
the
gods
it
was
athena
who
came
to
him
she
stood
apart
from
heracles
holding
in
her
hands
brazen
cymbals
these
she
clashed
together
at
the
sound
of
this
clashing
the
stymphalean
birds
rose
up
from
the
low
bushes
behind
the
jungle
heracles
shot
at
them
with
those
unerring
arrows
of
his
the
birds
fell
one
after
the
other
into
the
marsh
then
heracles
went
north
to
where
the
coryneian
deer
took
her
pasture
so
swift
of
foot
was
she
that
no
hound
nor
hunter
had
ever
been
able
to
overtake
her
for
the
whole
of
a
year
heracles
kept
golden
horns
in
chase
and
at
last
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
artemision
he
caught
her
artemis
the
goddess
of
the
wild
things
would
have
punished
heracles
for
capturing
the
deer
but
the
hero
pleaded
with
her
and
she
relented
and
agreed
to
let
him
bring
the
deer
to
mycenæ
and
show
her
to
king
eurystheus
and
artemis
took
charge
of
golden
horns
while
heracles
went
off
to
capture
the
erymanthean
boar
he
came
to
the
city
of
psophis
the
inhabitants
of
which
were
in
deadly
fear
because
of
the
ravages
of
the
boar
heracles
made
his
way
up
the
mountain
to
hunt
it
now
on
this
mountain
a
band
of
centaurs
lived
and
they
knowing
him
since
the
time
he
had
been
fostered
by
chiron
welcomed
heracles
one
of
them
pholus
took
heracles
to
the
great
house
where
the
centaurs
had
their
wine
stored
seldom
did
the
centaurs
drink
wine
a
draft
of
it
made
them
wild
and
so
they
stored
it
away
leaving
it
in
the
charge
of
one
of
their
band
heracles
begged
pholus
to
give
him
a
draft
of
wine
after
he
had
begged
again
and
again
the
centaur
opened
one
of
his
great
jars
heracles
drank
wine
and
spilled
it
then
the
centaurs
that
were
without
smelt
the
wine
and
came
hammering
at
the
door
demanding
the
drafts
that
would
make
them
wild
heracles
came
forth
to
drive
them
away
they
attacked
him
then
he
shot
at
them
with
his
unerring
arrows
and
he
drove
them
away
up
the
mountain
and
away
to
far
rivers
the
centaurs
raced
pursued
by
heracles
with
his
bow
one
was
slain
pholus
the
centaur
who
had
entertained
him
by
accident
heracles
dropped
a
poisoned
arrow
on
his
foot
he
took
the
body
of
pholus
up
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
buried
the
centaur
there
afterward
on
the
snows
of
erymanthus
he
set
a
snare
for
the
boar
and
caught
him
there
upon
his
shoulders
he
carried
the
boar
to
mycenæ
and
he
led
the
deer
by
her
golden
horns
when
eurystheus
had
looked
upon
them
the
boar
was
slain
but
the
deer
was
loosed
and
she
fled
back
to
the
mountain
artemision
king
eurystheus
sat
hidden
in
the
great
jar
and
he
thought
of
more
terrible
labors
he
would
make
heracles
engage
in
now
he
would
send
him
oversea
and
make
him
strive
with
fierce
tribes
and
more
dread
monsters
when
he
had
it
all
thought
out
he
had
heracles
brought
before
him
and
he
told
him
of
these
other
labors
he
was
to
go
to
savage
thrace
and
there
destroy
the
horses
of
king
diomedes
afterward
he
was
to
go
amongst
the
dread
women
the
amazons
daughters
of
ares
the
god
of
war
and
take
from
their
queen
hippolyte
the
girdle
that
ares
had
given
her
then
he
was
to
go
to
crete
and
take
from
the
keeping
of
king
minos
the
beautiful
bull
that
poseidon
had
given
him
afterward
he
was
to
go
to
the
island
of
erytheia
and
take
away
from
geryoneus
the
monster
that
had
three
bodies
instead
of
one
the
herd
of
red
cattle
that
the
hound
orthus
kept
guard
over
then
he
was
to
go
to
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
and
from
that
garden
he
was
to
take
the
golden
apples
that
zeus
had
given
to
hera
for
a
marriage
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
was
no
mortal
knew
so
heracles
set
out
on
a
long
and
perilous
quest
first
he
went
to
thrace
that
savage
land
that
was
ruled
over
by
diomedes
son
of
ares
the
war
god
heracles
broke
into
the
stable
where
the
horses
were
he
caught
three
of
them
by
their
heads
and
although
they
kicked
and
bit
and
trampled
he
forced
them
out
of
the
stable
and
down
to
the
seashore
where
his
companion
abderus
waited
for
him
the
screams
of
the
fierce
horses
were
heard
by
the
men
of
thrace
and
they
with
their
king
came
after
heracles
he
left
the
horses
in
charge
of
abderus
while
he
fought
the
thracians
and
their
savage
king
heracles
shot
his
deadly
arrows
amongst
them
and
then
he
fought
with
their
king
he
drove
them
from
the
seashore
and
then
he
came
back
to
where
he
had
left
abderus
with
the
fierce
horses
they
had
thrown
abderus
upon
the
ground
and
they
were
trampling
upon
him
heracles
drew
his
bow
and
he
shot
the
horses
with
the
unerring
arrows
that
were
dipped
with
the
gall
of
the
hydra
he
had
slain
screaming
the
horses
of
king
diomedes
raced
toward
the
sea
but
one
fell
and
another
fell
and
then
as
it
came
to
the
line
of
the
foam
the
third
of
the
fierce
horses
fell
they
were
all
slain
with
the
unerring
arrows
then
heracles
took
up
the
body
of
his
companion
and
he
buried
it
with
proper
rights
and
over
it
he
raised
a
column
afterward
around
that
column
a
city
that
bore
the
name
of
heracles
s
friend
was
built
then
toward
the
euxine
sea
he
went
there
where
the
river
themiscyra
flows
into
the
sea
he
saw
the
abodes
of
the
amazons
and
upon
the
rocks
and
the
steep
place
he
saw
the
warrior
women
standing
with
drawn
bows
in
their
hands
most
dangerous
did
they
seem
to
heracles
he
did
not
know
how
to
approach
them
he
might
shoot
at
them
with
his
unerring
arrows
but
when
his
arrows
were
all
shot
away
the
amazons
from
their
steep
places
might
be
able
to
kill
him
with
the
arrows
from
their
bows
while
he
stood
at
a
distance
wondering
what
he
might
do
a
horn
was
sounded
and
an
amazon
mounted
upon
a
white
stallion
rode
toward
him
when
the
came
near
she
cried
out
heracles
the
queen
hippolyte
permits
you
to
come
amongst
the
amazons
enter
her
tent
and
declare
to
the
queen
what
has
brought
you
amongst
the
heracles
came
to
the
tent
of
the
queen
there
stood
tall
hippolyte
with
an
iron
crown
upon
her
head
and
with
a
beautiful
girdle
of
bronze
and
iridescent
glass
around
her
waist
proud
and
fierce
as
a
mountain
eagle
looked
the
queen
of
the
amazons
heracles
did
not
know
in
what
way
he
might
conquer
her
outside
the
tent
the
amazons
stood
they
struck
their
shields
with
their
spears
keeping
up
a
continuous
savage
din
for
what
has
heracles
come
to
the
country
of
the
amazons
queen
hippolyte
asked
for
the
girdle
you
wear
said
heracles
and
he
held
his
hands
ready
for
the
struggle
is
it
for
the
girdle
given
me
by
ares
the
god
of
war
that
you
have
come
braving
the
amazons
heracles
asked
the
queen
for
that
said
heracles
i
would
not
have
you
enter
into
strife
with
the
amazons
said
queen
hippolyte
and
so
saying
she
drew
off
the
girdle
of
bronze
and
iridescent
glass
and
she
gave
it
into
his
hands
heracles
took
the
beautiful
girdle
into
his
hands
fearful
he
was
that
some
piece
of
guile
was
being
played
upon
him
but
then
he
looked
into
the
open
eyes
of
the
queen
and
he
saw
that
she
meant
no
guile
he
took
the
girdle
and
he
put
it
around
his
great
brows
then
he
thanked
hippolyte
and
he
went
from
the
tent
he
saw
the
amazons
standing
on
the
rocks
and
the
steep
places
with
bows
bent
unchallenged
he
went
on
and
he
came
to
his
ship
and
he
sailed
away
from
that
country
with
one
more
labor
accomplished
the
labor
that
followed
was
not
dangerous
he
sailed
over
sea
and
he
came
to
crete
to
the
land
that
king
minos
ruled
over
and
there
he
found
grazing
in
a
special
pasture
the
bull
that
poseidon
had
given
king
minos
he
laid
his
hands
upon
the
bull
s
horns
and
he
struggled
with
him
and
he
overthrew
him
then
he
drove
the
bull
down
to
the
seashore
his
next
labor
was
to
take
away
the
herd
of
red
cattle
that
was
owned
by
the
monster
geryoneus
in
the
island
of
erytheia
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
of
ocean
lived
the
monster
his
herd
guarded
by
the
hound
hound
was
the
brother
of
cerberus
the
hound
that
kept
guard
in
the
underworld
mounted
upon
the
bull
given
minos
by
poseidon
heracles
fared
across
the
sea
he
came
even
to
the
straits
that
divide
europe
from
africa
and
there
he
set
up
two
pillars
as
a
memorial
of
his
pillars
of
heracles
that
stand
to
this
day
he
and
the
bull
rested
there
beyond
him
stretched
the
stream
of
ocean
the
island
of
erytheia
was
there
but
heracles
thought
that
the
bull
would
not
be
able
to
bear
him
so
far
and
there
the
sun
beat
upon
him
and
drew
all
strength
away
from
him
and
he
was
dazed
and
dazzled
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
he
shouted
out
against
the
sun
and
in
his
anger
he
wanted
to
strive
against
the
sun
then
he
drew
his
bow
and
shot
arrows
upward
far
far
out
of
sight
the
arrows
of
heracles
went
and
the
sun
god
helios
was
filled
with
admiration
for
heracles
the
man
who
would
attempt
the
impossible
by
shooting
arrows
at
him
then
did
helios
fling
down
to
heracles
his
great
golden
cup
down
and
into
the
stream
of
ocean
fell
the
great
golden
cup
of
helios
it
floated
there
wide
enough
to
hold
all
the
men
who
might
be
in
a
ship
heracles
put
the
bull
of
minos
into
the
cup
of
helios
and
the
cup
bore
them
away
toward
the
west
and
across
the
stream
of
ocean
thus
heracles
came
to
the
island
of
erytheia
all
over
the
island
straggled
the
red
cattle
of
geryoneus
grazing
upon
the
rich
pastures
heracles
leaving
the
bull
of
minos
in
the
cup
went
upon
the
island
he
made
a
club
for
himself
out
of
a
tree
and
he
went
toward
the
cattle
the
hound
orthus
bayed
and
ran
toward
him
the
hound
that
was
the
brother
of
cerberus
sprang
at
heracles
with
poisonous
foam
upon
his
jaws
heracles
swung
his
club
and
struck
the
two
heads
off
the
hound
and
where
the
foam
of
the
hound
s
jaws
dropped
down
a
poisonous
plant
sprang
up
heracles
took
up
the
body
of
the
hound
and
swung
it
around
and
flung
it
far
out
into
the
ocean
illustration
then
the
monster
geryoneus
came
upon
him
three
bodies
he
had
instead
of
one
he
attacked
heracles
by
hurling
great
stones
at
him
heracles
was
hurt
by
the
stones
and
then
the
monster
beheld
the
cup
of
helios
and
he
began
to
hurl
stones
at
the
golden
thing
and
it
seemed
that
he
might
sink
it
in
the
sea
and
leave
heracles
without
a
way
of
getting
from
the
island
heracles
took
up
his
bow
and
he
shot
arrow
after
arrow
at
the
monster
and
he
left
him
dead
in
the
deep
grass
of
the
pastures
then
he
rounded
up
the
red
cattle
the
bulls
and
the
cows
and
he
drove
them
down
to
the
shore
and
into
the
golden
cup
of
helios
where
the
bull
of
minos
stayed
then
back
across
the
stream
of
ocean
the
cup
floated
and
the
bull
of
crete
and
the
cattle
of
geryoneus
were
brought
past
sicily
and
through
the
straits
called
the
hellespont
to
thrace
that
savage
land
they
came
then
heracles
took
the
cattle
out
and
the
cup
of
helios
sank
in
the
sea
through
the
wild
lands
of
thrace
he
drove
the
herd
of
geryoneus
and
the
bull
of
minos
and
he
came
into
mycenæ
once
more
but
he
did
not
stay
to
speak
with
eurystheus
he
started
off
to
find
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
long
did
he
search
but
he
found
no
one
who
could
tell
him
where
the
garden
was
and
at
last
he
went
to
chiron
on
the
mountain
pelion
and
chiron
told
heracles
what
journey
he
would
have
to
make
to
come
to
the
hesperides
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
far
did
heracles
journey
weary
he
was
when
he
came
to
where
atlas
stood
bearing
the
sky
upon
his
weary
shoulders
as
he
came
near
he
felt
an
perfume
being
wafted
toward
him
so
weary
was
he
with
his
journey
and
all
his
toils
that
he
would
fain
sink
down
and
dream
away
in
that
evening
land
but
he
roused
himself
and
he
journeyed
on
toward
where
the
perfume
came
from
over
that
place
a
star
seemed
always
about
to
rise
he
came
to
where
a
silver
lattice
fenced
a
garden
that
was
full
of
the
quiet
of
evening
golden
bees
hummed
through
the
air
and
there
was
the
sound
of
quiet
waters
how
wild
and
laborious
was
the
world
he
had
come
from
heracles
thought
he
felt
that
it
would
be
hard
for
him
to
return
to
that
world
he
saw
three
maidens
they
stood
with
wreaths
upon
their
heads
and
blossoming
branches
in
their
hands
when
the
maidens
saw
him
they
came
toward
him
crying
out
o
man
who
has
come
into
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
go
not
near
the
tree
that
the
sleepless
dragon
guards
then
they
went
and
stood
by
a
tree
as
if
to
keep
guard
over
it
all
around
were
trees
that
bore
flowers
and
fruit
but
this
tree
had
golden
apples
amongst
its
bright
green
leaves
then
he
saw
the
guardian
of
the
tree
beside
its
trunk
a
dragon
lay
and
as
heracles
came
near
the
dragon
showed
its
glittering
scales
and
its
deadly
claws
the
apples
were
within
reach
but
the
dragon
with
its
glittering
scales
and
claws
stood
in
the
way
heracles
shot
an
arrow
then
a
tremor
went
through
ladon
the
sleepless
dragon
it
screamed
and
then
lay
stark
the
maidens
cried
in
their
grief
heracles
went
to
the
tree
and
he
plucked
the
golden
apples
and
he
put
them
into
the
pouch
he
carried
down
on
the
ground
sank
the
hesperides
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
and
he
heard
their
laments
as
he
went
from
the
enchanted
garden
they
had
guarded
back
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
came
heracles
back
from
the
place
where
atlas
stood
holding
the
sky
upon
his
weary
shoulders
he
went
back
through
asia
and
libya
and
egypt
and
he
came
again
to
mycenæ
and
to
the
palace
of
eurystheus
he
brought
to
the
king
the
herd
of
geryoneus
he
brought
to
the
king
the
bull
of
minos
he
brought
to
the
king
the
girdle
of
hippolyte
he
brought
to
the
king
the
golden
apples
of
the
hesperides
and
king
eurystheus
with
his
thin
white
face
sat
upon
his
royal
throne
and
he
looked
over
all
the
wonderful
things
that
the
hero
had
brought
him
not
pleased
was
eurystheus
rather
was
he
angry
that
one
he
hated
could
win
such
wonderful
things
he
took
into
his
hands
the
golden
apples
of
the
hesperides
but
this
fruit
was
not
for
such
as
he
an
eagle
snatched
the
branch
from
his
hand
and
the
eagle
flew
and
flew
until
it
came
to
where
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
wept
in
their
garden
there
the
eagle
let
fall
the
branch
with
the
golden
apples
and
the
maidens
set
it
back
upon
the
tree
and
behold
it
grew
as
it
had
been
growing
before
heracles
plucked
it
the
next
day
the
heralds
of
eurystheus
came
to
heracles
and
they
told
him
of
the
last
labor
that
he
would
have
to
set
out
to
time
he
would
have
to
go
down
into
the
underworld
and
bring
up
from
king
aidoneus
s
realm
cerberus
the
hound
heracles
put
upon
him
the
impenetrable
lion
s
skin
and
set
forth
once
more
this
might
indeed
be
the
last
of
his
life
s
labors
cerberus
was
not
an
earthly
monster
and
he
who
would
struggle
with
cerberus
in
the
underworld
would
have
the
gods
of
the
dead
against
him
but
heracles
went
on
he
journeyed
to
the
cave
tainaron
which
was
an
entrance
to
the
underworld
far
into
that
dismal
cave
he
went
and
then
down
down
until
he
came
to
acheron
that
dim
river
that
has
beyond
it
only
the
people
of
the
dead
cerberus
bayed
at
him
from
the
place
where
the
dead
cross
the
river
knowing
that
he
was
no
shade
the
hound
sprang
at
heracles
but
he
could
neither
bite
nor
tear
through
that
impenetrable
lion
s
skin
heracles
held
him
by
the
neck
of
his
middle
head
so
that
cerberus
was
neither
able
to
bite
nor
tear
nor
bellow
then
to
the
brink
of
acheron
came
persephone
queen
of
the
underworld
she
declared
to
heracles
that
the
gods
of
the
dead
would
not
strive
against
him
if
he
promised
to
bring
cerberus
back
to
the
underworld
carrying
the
hound
downward
again
as
he
carried
him
upward
illustration
this
heracles
promised
he
turned
around
and
he
carried
cerberus
his
hands
around
the
monster
s
neck
while
foam
dripped
from
his
jaws
he
carried
him
on
and
upward
toward
the
world
of
men
out
through
a
cave
that
was
in
the
land
of
trœzen
heracles
came
still
carrying
cerberus
by
the
neck
of
his
middle
head
from
trœzen
to
mycenæ
the
hero
went
and
men
fled
before
him
at
the
sight
of
the
monster
that
he
carried
on
he
went
toward
the
king
s
palace
eurystheus
was
seated
outside
his
palace
that
day
looking
at
the
great
jar
that
he
had
often
hidden
in
and
thinking
to
himself
that
heracles
would
never
appear
to
affright
him
again
then
heracles
appeared
he
called
to
eurystheus
and
when
the
king
looked
up
he
held
the
hound
toward
him
the
three
heads
grinned
at
eurystheus
he
gave
a
cry
and
scrambled
into
the
jar
but
before
his
feet
touched
the
bottom
of
it
eurystheus
was
dead
of
fear
the
jar
rolled
over
and
heracles
looked
upon
the
body
that
was
all
twisted
with
fright
then
he
turned
around
and
made
his
way
back
to
the
underworld
on
the
brink
of
acheron
he
loosed
cerberus
and
the
bellow
of
the
hound
was
heard
again
ii
it
was
then
that
heracles
was
given
arms
by
the
sword
of
hermes
the
bow
of
apollo
the
shield
made
by
hephæstus
it
was
then
that
heracles
joined
the
argonauts
and
journeyed
with
them
to
the
edge
of
the
caucasus
where
slaying
the
vulture
that
preyed
upon
prometheus
s
liver
he
at
the
will
of
zeus
liberated
the
titan
thereafter
zeus
and
prometheus
were
reconciled
and
zeus
that
neither
might
forget
how
much
the
enmity
between
them
had
cost
gods
and
men
had
a
ring
made
for
prometheus
to
wear
that
ring
was
made
out
of
the
fetter
that
had
been
upon
him
and
in
it
was
set
a
fragment
of
the
rock
that
the
titan
had
been
bound
to
the
argonauts
had
now
won
back
to
greece
but
before
he
saw
any
of
them
he
had
been
in
oichalia
and
had
seen
the
maiden
iole
the
king
of
oichalia
had
offered
his
daughter
iole
in
marriage
to
the
hero
who
could
excel
himself
and
his
sons
in
shooting
with
arrows
heracles
saw
iole
the
and
childlike
maiden
and
he
longed
to
take
her
with
him
to
some
place
near
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
and
iole
looked
on
him
and
he
knew
that
she
wondered
to
see
him
so
tall
and
so
strongly
knit
even
as
he
wondered
to
see
her
so
childlike
and
delicate
then
the
contest
began
the
king
and
his
sons
shot
wonderfully
well
and
none
of
the
heroes
who
stood
before
heracles
had
a
chance
of
winning
then
heracles
shot
his
arrows
no
matter
how
far
away
they
moved
the
mark
heracles
struck
it
and
struck
the
very
center
of
it
the
people
wondered
who
this
great
archer
might
be
and
then
a
name
was
guessed
at
and
went
when
the
king
heard
the
name
of
heracles
he
would
not
let
him
strive
in
the
contest
any
more
for
the
maiden
iole
would
not
be
given
as
a
prize
to
one
who
had
been
mad
and
whose
madness
might
afflict
him
again
so
the
king
said
speaking
in
judgment
in
the
market
place
rage
came
on
heracles
when
he
heard
this
judgment
given
he
would
not
let
his
rage
master
him
lest
the
madness
that
was
spoken
of
should
come
with
his
rage
so
he
left
the
city
of
oichalia
declaring
to
the
king
and
the
people
that
he
would
return
it
was
then
that
wandering
down
to
crete
he
heard
of
the
argonauts
being
near
and
afterward
he
heard
of
them
being
in
calydon
hunting
the
boar
that
ravaged
œneus
s
country
to
calydon
heracles
went
the
heroes
had
departed
when
he
came
into
the
country
and
all
the
city
was
in
grief
for
the
deaths
of
prince
meleagrus
and
his
two
uncles
on
the
steps
of
the
temple
where
meleagrus
and
his
uncles
had
been
brought
heracles
saw
deianira
meleagrus
s
sister
she
was
pale
with
her
grief
this
tall
woman
of
the
mountains
she
looked
like
a
priestess
but
also
like
a
woman
who
could
cheer
camps
of
men
with
her
counsel
her
bravery
and
her
good
companionship
her
hair
was
very
dark
and
she
had
dark
eyes
straightway
she
became
friends
with
heracles
and
when
they
saw
each
other
for
a
while
they
loved
each
other
and
heracles
forgot
iole
the
childlike
maiden
whom
he
had
seen
in
oichalia
he
made
himself
a
suitor
for
deianira
and
those
who
protected
her
were
glad
of
heracles
s
suit
and
they
told
him
they
would
give
him
the
maiden
to
marry
as
soon
as
the
mourning
for
prince
meleagrus
and
his
uncles
was
over
heracles
stayed
in
calydon
happy
with
deianira
who
had
so
much
beauty
wisdom
and
bravery
but
then
a
dreadful
thing
happened
in
calydon
by
an
accident
while
using
his
strength
unthinkingly
heracles
killed
a
lad
who
was
related
to
deianira
he
might
not
marry
her
now
until
he
had
taken
punishment
for
slaying
one
who
was
close
to
her
in
blood
as
a
punishment
for
the
slaying
it
was
judged
that
heracles
should
be
sold
into
slavery
for
three
years
at
the
end
of
his
three
years
slavery
he
could
come
back
to
calydon
and
wed
deianira
and
so
heracles
and
deianira
were
parted
he
was
sold
as
a
slave
in
lydia
the
one
who
bought
him
was
a
woman
a
widow
named
omphale
to
her
house
heracles
went
carrying
his
armor
and
wearing
his
lion
s
skin
and
omphale
laughed
to
see
this
tall
man
dressed
in
a
lion
s
skin
coming
to
her
house
to
do
a
servant
s
tasks
for
her
she
and
all
in
her
house
kept
up
fun
with
heracles
they
would
set
him
to
do
housework
to
carry
water
and
set
vessels
on
the
tables
and
clear
the
vessels
away
omphale
set
him
to
spin
with
a
spindle
as
the
women
did
and
often
she
would
put
on
heracles
s
lion
skin
and
go
about
dragging
his
club
while
he
dressed
in
woman
s
garb
washed
dishes
and
emptied
pots
but
he
would
lose
patience
with
these
servant
s
tasks
and
then
omphale
would
let
him
go
away
and
perform
some
great
exploit
often
he
went
on
long
journeys
and
stayed
away
for
long
times
it
was
while
he
was
in
slavery
to
omphale
that
he
liberated
theseus
from
the
dungeon
in
which
he
was
held
with
peirithous
and
it
was
while
he
still
was
in
slavery
that
he
made
his
journey
to
troy
at
troy
he
helped
to
repair
for
king
laomedon
the
great
walls
that
years
before
apollo
and
poseidon
had
built
around
the
city
as
a
reward
for
this
labor
he
was
offered
the
princess
hesione
in
marriage
she
was
the
daughter
of
king
laomedon
and
the
sister
of
priam
who
was
then
called
not
priam
but
podarces
he
helped
to
repair
the
wall
and
two
of
the
argonauts
were
there
to
aid
him
one
was
peleus
and
the
other
was
telamon
peleus
did
not
stay
for
long
telamon
stayed
and
to
reward
telamon
heracles
withdrew
his
own
claim
for
the
hand
of
the
princess
hesione
it
was
not
hard
on
heracles
to
do
this
for
his
thoughts
were
ever
upon
deianira
but
telamon
rejoiced
for
he
loved
hesione
greatly
on
the
day
they
married
heracles
showed
the
two
an
eagle
in
the
sky
he
said
it
was
sent
as
an
omen
to
omen
for
their
marriage
and
in
memory
of
that
omen
telamon
named
his
son
aias
that
is
then
the
walls
of
troy
were
repaired
and
heracles
turned
toward
lydia
omphale
s
home
not
long
would
he
have
to
serve
omphale
now
for
his
three
years
slavery
was
nearly
over
soon
he
would
go
back
to
calydon
and
wed
deianira
as
he
went
along
the
road
to
lydia
he
thought
of
all
the
pleasantries
that
had
been
made
in
omphale
s
house
and
he
laughed
at
the
memory
of
them
lydia
was
a
friendly
country
and
even
though
he
had
been
in
slavery
heracles
had
had
his
good
times
there
he
was
tired
with
the
journey
and
made
sleepy
with
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
when
he
came
within
sight
of
omphale
s
house
he
lay
down
by
the
side
of
the
road
first
taking
off
his
armor
and
laying
aside
his
bow
his
quiver
and
his
shield
he
wakened
up
to
see
two
men
looking
down
upon
him
he
knew
that
these
were
the
cercopes
robbers
who
waylaid
travelers
upon
this
road
they
were
laughing
as
they
looked
down
on
him
and
heracles
saw
that
they
held
his
arms
and
his
armor
in
their
hands
they
thought
that
this
man
for
all
his
tallness
would
yield
to
them
when
he
saw
that
they
had
his
arms
and
his
armor
but
heracles
sprang
up
and
he
caught
one
by
the
waist
and
the
other
by
the
neck
and
he
turned
them
upside
down
and
tied
them
together
by
the
heels
now
he
held
them
securely
and
he
would
take
them
to
the
town
and
give
them
over
to
those
whom
they
had
waylaid
and
robbed
he
hung
them
by
their
heels
across
his
shoulders
and
marched
on
but
the
robbers
as
they
were
being
bumped
along
began
to
relate
pleasantries
and
mirthful
tales
to
each
other
and
heracles
listening
had
to
laugh
and
one
said
to
the
other
o
my
brother
we
are
in
the
position
of
the
frogs
when
the
mice
fell
upon
them
with
such
and
the
other
said
indeed
nothing
can
save
us
if
zeus
does
not
send
an
ally
to
us
as
he
sent
an
ally
to
the
and
the
first
robber
said
who
began
that
conflict
the
frogs
or
the
mice
and
thereupon
the
second
robber
his
head
reaching
down
to
heracles
s
waist
began
the
battle
of
the
frogs
and
mice
a
warlike
mouse
came
down
to
the
brink
of
a
pond
for
no
other
reason
than
to
take
a
drink
of
water
up
to
him
hopped
a
frog
speaking
in
the
voice
of
one
who
had
rule
and
authority
the
frog
said

our
shore

asked

doubtfully
upon
my
back
said
the
frog
up
now

snatcher
and
as
we
go

will
show
you
the
wonders
of
the
he
offered
his
back
and
crumb
snatcher
bravely
mounted
the
mouse
put
his
forepaws
around
the
frog
s
neck
then
puff
jaw
swam
out
crumb
snatcher
at
first
was
pleased
to
feel
himself
moving
through
the
water
but
as
the
dark
waves
began
to
rise
his
mighty
heart
began
to
quail
he
longed
to
be
back
upon
the
land
he
groaned
aloud
how
quickly
we
get
on
cried
puff
jaw
soon
we
shall
be
at
my
land
heartened
by
this
speech
crumb
snatcher
put
his
tail
into
the
water
and
worked
it
as
a
steering
oar
on
and
on
they
went
and
crumb
snatcher
gained
heart
for
the
adventure
what
a
wonderful
tale
he
would
have
to
tell
to
the
clans
of
the
mice
but
suddenly
out
of
the
depths
of
the
pond
a
water
snake
raised
his
horrid
head
fearsome
did
that
head
seem
to
both
mouse
and
frog
and
forgetful
of
the
guest
that
he
carried
upon
his
back
puff
jaw
dived
down
into
the
water
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
pond
and
lay
on
the
mud
in
safety
but
far
from
safety
was
crumb
snatcher
the
mouse
he
sank
and
rose
and
sank
again
his
wet
fur
weighed
him
down
but
before
he
sank
for
the
last
time
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
cried
out
and
his
cry
was
heard
at
the
brink
of
the
pond
ah
puff
jaw
treacherous
frog
an
evil
thing
you
have
done
leaving
me
to
drown
in
the
middle
of
the
pond
had
you
faced
me
on
the
land
i
should
have
shown
you
which
of
us
two
was
the
better
warrior
now
i
must
lose
my
life
in
the
water
but
i
tell
you
my
death
shall
not
go
cowardly
frogs
will
be
punished
for
the
ill
they
have
done
to
me
who
am
the
son
of
the
king
of
the
then
crumb
snatcher
sank
for
the
last
time
but
lick
platter
who
was
at
the
brink
of
the
pond
had
heard
his
words
straightway
this
mouse
rushed
to
the
hole
of
bread
nibbler
and
told
him
of
the
death
of
his
princely
son
bread
nibbler
called
out
the
clans
of
the
mice
the
warrior
mice
armed
themselves
and
this
was
the
grand
way
of
their
arming
first
the
mice
put
on
greaves
that
covered
their
forelegs
these
they
made
out
of
bean
shells
broken
in
two
for
shield
each
had
a
lamp
s
centerpiece
for
spears
they
had
the
long
bronze
needles
that
they
had
carried
out
of
the
houses
of
men
so
armed
and
so
accoutered
they
were
ready
to
war
upon
the
frogs
and
bread
nibbler
their
king
shouted
to
them
fall
upon
the
cowardly
frogs
and
leave
not
one
alive
upon
the
bank
of
the
pond
henceforth
that
bank
is
ours
and
ours
only
forward
and
on
the
other
side
puff
jaw
was
urging
the
frogs
to
battle
let
us
take
our
places
on
the
edge
of
the
pond
he
said
and
when
the
mice
come
amongst
us
let
each
catch
hold
of
one
and
throw
him
into
the
pond
thus
we
will
get
rid
of
these
dry
bobs
the
the
frogs
applauded
the
speech
of
their
king
and
straightway
they
went
to
their
armor
and
their
weapons
their
legs
they
covered
with
the
leaves
of
mallow
for
breastplates
they
had
the
leaves
of
beets
cabbage
leaves
well
cut
made
their
strong
shields
they
took
their
spears
from
the
pond
pointed
rushes
they
were
and
they
placed
upon
their
heads
helmets
that
were
empty
snail
shells
so
armed
and
so
accoutered
they
were
ready
to
meet
the
grand
attack
of
the
mice
when
the
robber
came
to
this
part
of
the
story
heracles
halted
his
march
for
he
was
shaking
with
laughter
the
robber
stopped
in
his
story
heracles
slapped
him
on
the
leg
and
said
what
more
of
the
heroic
exploits
of
the
mice
the
second
robber
said
i
know
no
more
but
perhaps
my
brother
at
the
other
side
of
you
can
tell
you
of
the
mighty
combat
between
them
and
the
then
heracles
shifted
the
first
robber
from
his
back
to
his
front
and
the
first
robber
said
i
will
tell
you
what
i
know
about
the
heroical
combat
between
the
frogs
and
the
and
thereupon
he
began
the
gnats
blew
their
trumpets
this
was
the
dread
signal
for
war

struck
the
first
blow

fell
upon

and
overthrew
him
at
this
loud
crier

friend

threw
down
spear
and
shield
and
dived
into
the
water
this
seemed
to
presage
victory
for
the
mice
but
then
water
larker
the
most
warlike
of
the
frogs
took
up
a
great
pebble
and
flung
it
at
ham
nibbler
who
was
then
pursuing
reedy
down
fell
ham

and
there
was
dismay
in
the
ranks
of
the
mice
then
cabbage

a
frog
took
up
a
clod
of
mud
and
flung
it
full
at
a
mouse
that
was
coming
furiously
upon
him
that
mouse
s
helmet
was
knocked
off
and
his
forehead
was
plastered
with
the
clod
of
mud
so
that
he
was
blinded
it
was
then
that
victory
inclined
to
the
frogs
bread
nibbler
again
came
into
the
fray
he
rushed
furiously
upon
puff

the
king
leeky
the
trusted

opposed

onslaught
mightily
he
drove
his
spear
at
the
king
of
the
mice
but
the
point
of
the
spear
broke
upon
bread
nibbler
s
shield
and
then
leeky
was
overthrown
bread
nibbler
came
upon
puff
jaw
and
the
two
great
kings
faced
each
other
the
frogs
and
the
mice
drew
aside
and
there
was
a
pause
in
the
combat
bread
nibbler
the
mouse
struck
puff

the
frog
terribly
upon
the
toes

drew
out
of
the
battle
now
all
would
have
been
lost
for
the
frogs
had
not
zeus
the
father
of
the
gods
looked
down
upon
the
battle
dear

said
zeus
what
can
be
done
to
save
the
frogs
they
will
surely
be
annihilated
if
the
charge
of
yonder
mouse
is
not
for
the
father
of
the
gods
looking
down
saw
a
warrior
mouse
coming
on
in
the
most
dreadful
onslaught
of
the
whole
battle
slice
snatcher
was
the
name
of
this
warrior
he
had
come
late
into
the
field
he
waited
to
split
a
chestnut
in
two
and
to
put
the
halves
upon
his
paws
then
furiously
dashing
amongst
the
frogs
he
cried
out
that
he
would
not
leave
the
ground
until
he
had
destroyed
the
race
leaving
the
bank
of
the
pond
a
playground
for
the
mice
and
for
the
mice
alone
to
stop
the
charge
of
slice
snatcher
there
was
nothing
for
zeus
to
do
but
to
hurl
the
thunderbolt
that
is
the
terror
of
gods
and
men
frogs
and
mice
were
awed
by
the
thunder
and
the
flame
but
still
the
mice
urged
on
by
slice
snatcher
did
not
hold
back
from
their
onslaught
upon
the
frogs
now
would
the
frogs
have
been
utterly
destroyed
but
as
they
dashed
on
the
mice
encountered
a
new
and
a
dreadful
army
the
warriors
in
these
ranks
had
mailed
backs
and
curving
claws
they
had
bandy
legs
and
arms
they
had
eyes
that
looked
behind
them
they
came
on
sideways
these
were
the
crabs
creatures
until
now
unknown
to
the
mice
and
the
crabs
had
been
sent
by
zeus
to
save
the
race
of
the
frogs
from
utter
destruction

upon

mice
they
nipped
their
paws
the
mice
turned
around
and
they
nipped
their
tails
in
vain
the
boldest
of
the
mice
struck
at
the
crabs
with
their
sharpened
spears
not
upon
the
hard
shells
on
the
backs
of

crabs
did
the
spears
of

mice
make
any
dint
on
and
on
on
their
queer
feet
and
with
their
terrible
nippers
the
crabs
went
bread
nibbler
could
not
rally
them
any
more
and
slice
snatcher
ceased
to
speak
of
the
monument
of
victory
that
the
mice
would
erect
upon
the
bank
of
the
pond
with
their
heads
out
of
the
water
they
had
retreated
to
the
frogs
watched
the
finish
of
the
battle
the
mice
threw
down
their
spears
and
shields
and
fled
from
the
battleground
on
went
the
crabs
as
if
they
cared
nothing
for
their
victory
and
the
frogs
came
out
of
the
water
and
sat
upon
the
bank
and
watched
them
in
awe
heracles
had
laughed
at
the
diverting
tale
that
the
robbers
had
told
him
he
could
not
bring
them
then
to
a
place
where
they
would
meet
with
captivity
or
death
he
let
them
loose
upon
the
highway
and
the
robbers
thanked
him
with
speeches
and
they
declared
that
if
they
should
ever
find
him
sleeping
by
the
roadway
again
they
would
let
him
lie
saying
this
they
went
away
and
heracles
laughing
as
he
thought
upon
the
great
exploits
of
the
frogs
and
mice
went
on
to
omphale
s
house
omphale
the
widow
received
him
mirthfully
and
then
set
him
to
do
tasks
in
the
kitchen
while
she
sat
and
talked
to
him
about
troy
and
the
affairs
of
king
laomedon
and
afterward
she
put
on
his
lion
s
skin
and
went
about
in
the
courtyard
dragging
the
heavy
club
after
her
mirthfully
and
pleasantly
she
made
the
rest
of
his
time
in
lydia
pass
for
heracles
and
the
last
day
of
his
slavery
soon
came
and
he
bade
to
omphale
that
pleasant
widow
and
to
lydia
and
he
started
off
for
calydon
to
claim
his
bride
deianira
beautiful
indeed
deianira
looked
now
that
she
had
ceased
to
mourn
for
her
brother
for
the
laughter
that
had
been
under
her
grief
always
now
flashed
out
even
while
she
looked
priestesslike
and
of
good
counsel
her
dark
eyes
shone
like
stars
and
her
being
had
the
spirit
of
one
who
wanders
from
camp
to
camp
always
greeting
friends
and
leaving
friends
behind
her
heracles
and
deianira
wed
and
they
set
out
for
tiryns
where
a
king
had
left
a
kingdom
to
heracles
they
came
to
the
river
evenus
heracles
could
have
crossed
the
river
by
himself
but
he
could
not
cross
it
at
the
part
he
came
to
carrying
deianira
he
and
she
went
along
the
river
seeking
a
ferry
that
might
take
them
across
they
wandered
along
the
side
of
the
river
happy
with
each
other
and
they
came
to
a
place
where
they
had
sight
of
a
centaur
heracles
knew
this
centaur
he
was
nessus
one
of
the
centaurs
whom
he
had
chased
up
the
mountain
the
time
when
he
went
to
hunt
the
erymanthean
boar
the
centaurs
knew
him
and
nessus
spoke
to
heracles
as
if
he
had
friendship
for
him
he
would
he
said
carry
heracles
s
bride
across
the
river
then
heracles
crossed
the
river
and
he
waited
on
the
other
side
for
nessus
and
deianira
nessus
went
to
another
part
of
the
river
to
make
his
crossing
then
heracles
upon
the
other
bank
heard
screams
of
his
wife
deianira
he
saw
that
the
centaur
was
savagely
attacking
her
then
heracles
leveled
his
bow
and
he
shot
at
nessus
arrow
after
arrow
he
shot
into
the
centaur
s
body
nessus
loosed
his
hold
on
deianira
and
he
lay
down
on
the
bank
of
the
river
his
lifeblood
streaming
from
him
then
nessus
dying
but
with
his
rage
against
heracles
unabated
thought
of
a
way
by
which
the
hero
might
be
made
to
suffer
for
the
death
he
had
brought
upon
him
he
called
to
deianira
and
she
seeing
he
could
do
her
no
more
hurt
came
close
to
him
he
told
her
that
in
repentance
for
his
attack
upon
her
he
would
bestow
a
great
gift
upon
her
she
was
to
gather
up
some
of
the
blood
that
flowed
from
him
his
blood
the
centaur
said
would
be
a
love
philter
and
if
ever
her
husband
s
love
for
her
waned
it
would
grow
fresh
again
if
she
gave
to
him
something
from
her
hands
that
would
have
this
blood
upon
it
deianira
who
had
heard
from
heracles
of
the
wisdom
of
the
centaurs
believed
what
nessus
told
her
she
took
a
phial
and
let
the
blood
pour
into
it
then
nessus
plunged
into
the
river
and
died
there
as
heracles
came
up
to
where
deianira
stood
she
did
not
speak
to
him
about
the
centaur
s
words
to
her
nor
did
she
tell
him
that
she
had
hidden
away
the
phial
that
had
nessus
s
blood
in
it
they
crossed
the
river
at
another
point
and
they
came
after
a
time
to
tiryns
and
to
the
kingdom
that
had
been
left
to
heracles
there
heracles
and
deianira
lived
and
a
son
who
was
named
hyllos
was
born
to
them
and
after
a
time
heracles
was
led
into
a
war
with
who
was
king
of
oichalia
word
came
to
deianira
that
oichalia
was
taken
by
heracles
and
that
the
king
and
his
daughter
iole
were
held
captive
deianira
knew
that
heracles
had
once
tried
to
win
this
maiden
for
his
wife
and
she
feared
that
the
sight
of
iole
would
bring
his
old
longing
back
to
him
illustration
she
thought
upon
the
words
that
nessus
had
said
to
her
and
even
as
she
thought
upon
them
messengers
came
from
heracles
to
ask
her
to
send
him
a
beautifully
woven
robe
that
she
he
might
wear
it
while
making
a
sacrifice
deianira
took
down
the
robe
through
this
robe
she
thought
the
blood
of
the
centaur
could
touch
heracles
and
his
love
for
her
would
revive
thinking
this
she
poured
nessus
s
blood
over
the
robe
heracles
was
in
oichalia
when
the
messengers
returned
to
him
he
took
the
robe
that
deianira
sent
and
he
went
to
a
mountain
that
overlooked
the
sea
that
he
might
make
the
sacrifice
there
iole
went
with
him
then
he
put
on
the
robe
that
deianira
had
sent
when
it
touched
his
flesh
the
robe
burst
into
flame
heracles
tried
to
tear
it
off
but
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
flesh
the
flames
went
they
burned
and
burned
and
none
could
quench
them
then
heracles
knew
that
his
end
was
near
he
would
die
by
fire
and
knowing
that
he
piled
up
a
great
heap
of
wood
and
he
climbed
upon
it
there
he
stayed
with
the
flaming
robe
burning
into
him
and
he
begged
of
those
who
passed
to
fire
the
pile
that
his
end
might
come
more
quickly
none
would
fire
the
pile
but
at
last
there
came
that
way
a
young
warrior
named
philoctetes
and
heracles
begged
of
him
to
fire
the
pile
philoctetes
knowing
that
it
was
the
will
of
the
gods
that
heracles
should
die
that
way
lighted
the
pile
for
that
heracles
bestowed
upon
him
his
great
bow
and
his
unerring
arrows
and
it
was
this
bow
and
these
arrows
brought
from
philoctetes
that
afterward
helped
to
take
priam
s
city
the
pile
that
heracles
stood
upon
was
fired
high
up
above
the
sea
the
pile
burned
all
who
were
near
that
burning
except
iole
that
childlike
maiden
she
stayed
and
watched
the
flames
mount
up
and
up
they
wrapped
the
sky
and
the
voice
of
heracles
was
heard
calling
upon
zeus
then
a
great
chariot
came
and
heracles
was
borne
away
to
olympus
thus
after
many
labors
heracles
passed
away
a
mortal
passing
into
an
immortal
being
in
a
great
burning
high
above
the
sea
admetus
i
decorative
first
letter
happened
once
that
zeus
would
punish
apollo
his
son
then
he
banished
him
from
olympus
and
he
made
him
put
off
his
divinity
and
appear
as
a
mortal
man
and
as
a
mortal
apollo
sought
to
earn
his
bread
amongst
men
he
came
to
the
house
of
king
admetus
and
took
service
with
him
as
his
herdsman
for
a
year
apollo
served
the
young
king
minding
his
herds
of
black
cattle
admetus
did
not
know
that
it
was
one
of
the
immortal
gods
who
was
in
his
house
and
in
his
fields
but
he
treated
him
in
friendly
wise
and
apollo
was
happy
whilst
serving
admetus
afterward
people
wondered
at
admetus
s
face
and
being
it
was
the
god
s
kindly
thought
of
him
that
gave
him
such
happiness
and
when
apollo
was
leaving
his
house
and
his
fields
he
revealed
himself
to
admetus
and
he
made
a
promise
to
him
that
when
the
god
of
the
underworld
sent
death
for
him
he
would
have
one
more
chance
of
baffling
death
than
any
mortal
man
that
was
before
admetus
sailed
on
the
with
jason
and
the
companions
of
the
quest
the
companionship
of
admetus
brought
happiness
to
many
on
the
voyage
but
the
hero
to
whom
it
gave
the
most
happiness
was
heracles
and
often
heracles
would
have
admetus
beside
him
to
tell
him
about
the
radiant
god
apollo
whose
bow
and
arrows
heracles
had
been
given
after
that
voyage
and
after
the
hunt
in
calydon
admetus
went
back
to
his
own
land
there
he
wed
that
fair
and
loving
woman
alcestis
he
might
not
wed
her
until
he
had
yoked
lions
and
leopards
to
the
chariot
that
drew
her
this
was
a
feat
that
no
hero
had
been
able
to
accomplish
with
apollo
s
aid
he
accomplished
it
thereafter
admetus
having
the
love
of
alcestis
was
even
more
happy
than
he
had
been
before
one
day
as
he
walked
by
fold
and
through
pasture
field
he
saw
a
figure
standing
beside
his
herd
of
black
cattle
a
radiant
figure
it
was
and
admetus
knew
that
this
was
apollo
come
to
him
again
he
went
toward
the
god
and
he
made
reverence
and
began
to
speak
to
him
but
apollo
turned
to
admetus
a
face
that
was
without
joy
what
years
of
happiness
have
been
mine
o
apollo
through
your
friendship
for
me
said
admetus
ah
as
i
walked
my
pasture
land
it
came
into
my
mind
how
much
i
loved
this
green
earth
and
the
blue
sky
and
all
that
i
know
of
love
and
happiness
has
come
to
me
through
but
still
apollo
stood
before
him
with
a
face
that
was
without
joy
he
spoke
and
his
voice
was
not
that
clear
and
vibrant
voice
that
he
had
once
in
speaking
to
admetus
admetus
admetus
he
said
it
is
for
me
to
tell
you
that
you
may
no
more
look
on
the
blue
sky
nor
walk
upon
the
green
earth
it
is
for
me
to
tell
you
that
the
god
of
the
underworld
will
have
you
come
to
him
admetus
admetus
know
that
even
now
the
god
of
the
underworld
is
sending
death
for
then
the
light
of
the
world
went
out
for
admetus
and
he
heard
himself
speaking
to
apollo
in
a
shaking
voice
o
apollo
apollo
thou
art
a
god
and
surely
thou
canst
save
me
save
me
now
from
this
death
that
the
god
of
the
underworld
is
sending
for
me
but
apollo
said
long
ago
admetus
i
made
a
bargain
with
the
god
of
the
underworld
on
thy
behalf
thou
hast
been
given
a
chance
more
than
any
mortal
man
if
one
will
go
willingly
in
thy
place
with
death
thou
canst
still
live
on
go
admetus
thou
art
well
loved
and
it
may
be
that
thou
wilt
find
one
to
take
thy
then
apollo
went
up
unto
the
mountaintop
and
admetus
stayed
for
a
while
beside
the
cattle
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
little
of
the
darkness
had
lifted
from
the
world
he
would
go
to
his
palace
there
were
aged
men
and
women
there
servants
and
slaves
and
one
of
them
would
surely
be
willing
to
take
the
king
s
place
and
go
with
death
down
to
the
underworld
so
admetus
thought
as
he
went
toward
the
palace
and
then
he
came
upon
an
ancient
woman
who
sat
upon
stones
in
the
courtyard
grinding
corn
between
two
stones
long
had
she
been
doing
that
wearisome
labor
admetus
had
known
her
from
the
first
time
he
had
come
into
that
courtyard
as
a
little
child
and
he
had
never
seen
aught
in
her
face
but
a
heavy
misery
there
she
was
sitting
as
he
had
first
known
her
with
her
eyes
bleared
and
her
knees
shaking
and
with
the
dust
of
the
courtyard
and
the
husks
of
the
corn
in
her
matted
hair
he
went
to
her
and
spoke
to
her
and
he
asked
her
to
take
the
place
of
the
king
and
go
with
death
but
when
she
heard
the
name
of
death
horror
came
into
the
face
of
the
ancient
woman
and
she
cried
out
that
she
would
not
let
death
come
near
her
then
admetus
left
her
and
he
came
upon
another
upon
a
sightless
man
who
held
out
a
shriveled
hand
for
the
food
that
the
servants
of
the
palace
might
bestow
upon
him
admetus
took
the
man
s
shriveled
hand
and
he
asked
him
if
he
would
not
take
the
king
s
place
and
go
with
death
that
was
coming
for
him
the
sightless
man
with
howls
and
shrieks
said
he
would
not
go
then
admetus
went
into
the
palace
and
into
the
chamber
where
his
bed
was
and
he
lay
down
upon
the
bed
and
he
lamented
that
he
would
have
to
go
with
death
that
was
coming
for
him
from
the
god
of
the
underworld
and
he
lamented
that
none
of
the
wretched
ones
around
the
palace
would
take
his
place
a
hand
was
laid
upon
him
he
looked
up
and
he
saw
his
tall
and
wife
alcestis
beside
him
alcestis
spoke
to
him
slowly
and
gravely
i
have
heard
what
you
have
said
o
my
husband
said
she
one
should
go
in
your
place
for
you
are
the
king
and
have
many
great
affairs
to
attend
to
and
if
none
other
will
go
i
alcestis
will
go
in
your
place
it
had
seemed
to
admetus
that
ever
since
he
had
heard
the
words
of
apollo
that
heavy
footsteps
were
coming
toward
him
now
the
footsteps
seemed
to
stop
it
was
not
so
terrible
for
him
as
before
he
sprang
up
and
he
took
the
hands
of
alcestis
and
he
said
you
then
will
take
my
place
i
will
go
with
death
in
your
place
admetus
alcestis
said
then
even
as
admetus
looked
into
her
face
he
saw
a
pallor
come
upon
her
her
body
weakened
and
she
sank
down
upon
the
bed
then
watching
over
her
he
knew
that
not
he
but
alcestis
would
go
with
death
and
the
words
he
had
spoken
he
would
have
taken
words
that
had
brought
her
consent
to
go
with
death
in
his
place
illustration
paler
and
weaker
alcestis
grew
death
would
soon
be
here
for
her
no
not
here
for
he
would
not
have
death
come
into
the
palace
he
lifted
alcestis
from
the
bed
and
he
carried
her
from
the
palace
he
carried
her
to
the
temple
of
the
gods
he
laid
her
there
upon
the
bier
and
waited
there
beside
her
no
more
speech
came
from
her
he
went
back
to
the
palace
where
all
was
servants
moved
about
with
heads
bowed
lamenting
silently
for
their
mistress
ii
as
admetus
was
coming
back
from
the
temple
he
heard
a
great
shout
he
looked
up
and
saw
one
standing
at
the
palace
doorway
he
knew
him
by
his
lion
s
skin
and
his
great
height
this
was
come
to
visit
him
but
come
at
a
sad
hour
he
could
not
now
rejoice
in
the
company
of
heracles
and
yet
heracles
might
be
on
his
way
from
the
accomplishment
of
some
great
labor
and
it
would
not
be
right
to
say
a
word
that
might
turn
him
away
from
his
doorway
he
might
have
much
need
of
rest
and
refreshment
thinking
this
admetus
went
up
to
heracles
and
took
his
hand
and
welcomed
him
into
his
house
how
is
it
with
you
friend
admetus
heracles
asked
admetus
would
only
say
that
nothing
was
happening
in
his
house
and
that
heracles
his
was
welcome
there
his
mind
was
upon
a
great
sacrifice
he
said
and
so
he
would
not
be
able
to
feast
with
him
the
servants
brought
heracles
to
the
bath
and
then
showed
him
where
a
feast
was
laid
for
him
and
as
for
admetus
he
went
within
the
chamber
and
knelt
beside
the
bed
on
which
alcestis
had
lain
and
thought
of
his
terrible
loss
heracles
after
the
bath
put
on
the
brightly
colored
tunic
that
the
servants
of
admetus
brought
him
he
put
a
wreath
upon
his
head
and
sat
down
to
the
feast
it
was
a
pity
he
thought
that
admetus
was
not
feasting
with
him
but
this
was
only
the
first
of
many
feasts
and
thinking
of
what
companionship
he
would
have
with
admetus
heracles
left
the
feasting
hall
and
came
to
where
the
servants
were
standing
about
in
silence
why
is
the
house
of
admetus
so
hushed
heracles
asked
it
is
because
of
what
is
befalling
said
one
of
the
servants
ah
the
sacrifice
that
the
king
is
making
said
heracles
to
what
god
is
that
sacrifice
due
to
the
god
of
the
underworld
said
the
servant
death
is
coming
to
alcestis
the
queen
where
she
lies
on
a
bier
in
the
temple
of
the
then
the
servant
told
heracles
the
story
of
how
alcestis
had
taken
her
husband
s
place
going
in
his
stead
with
death
heracles
thought
upon
the
sorrow
of
his
friend
and
of
the
great
sacrifice
that
his
wife
was
making
for
him
how
noble
it
was
of
admetus
to
bring
him
into
his
house
and
give
entertainment
to
him
while
such
sorrow
was
upon
him
and
then
heracles
felt
that
another
labor
was
before
him
illustration
i
have
dragged
up
from
the
underworld
he
thought
the
hound
that
guards
those
whom
death
brings
down
into
the
realm
of
the
god
of
the
underworld
why
should
i
not
strive
with
death
and
what
a
noble
thing
it
would
be
to
bring
back
this
faithful
woman
to
her
house
and
to
her
husband
this
is
a
labor
that
has
not
been
laid
upon
me
and
it
is
a
labor
i
will
so
heracles
said
to
himself
he
left
the
palace
of
admetus
and
he
went
to
the
temple
of
the
gods
he
stood
inside
the
temple
and
he
saw
the
bier
on
which
alcestis
was
laid
he
looked
upon
the
queen
death
had
not
touched
her
yet
although
she
lay
so
still
and
so
silent
heracles
would
watch
beside
her
and
strive
with
death
for
her
heracles
watched
and
death
came
when
death
entered
the
temple
heracles
laid
hands
upon
him
death
had
never
been
gripped
by
mortal
hands
and
he
strode
on
as
if
that
grip
meant
nothing
to
him
but
then
he
had
to
grip
heracles
in
death
s
grip
there
was
a
strength
beyond
strength
and
upon
heracles
a
dreadful
sense
of
loss
came
as
death
laid
hands
upon
sense
of
the
loss
of
light
and
the
loss
of
breath
and
the
loss
of
movement
but
heracles
struggled
with
death
although
his
breath
went
and
his
strength
seemed
to
go
from
him
he
held
that
stony
body
to
him
and
the
cold
of
that
body
went
through
him
and
its
stoniness
seemed
to
turn
his
bones
to
stone
but
still
heracles
strove
with
him
and
at
last
he
overthrew
him
and
he
held
death
down
upon
the
ground
now
you
are
held
by
me
death
cried
heracles
you
are
held
by
me
and
the
god
of
the
underworld
will
be
made
angry
because
you
can
not
go
about
his
this
business
or
any
other
business
you
are
held
by
me
death
and
you
will
not
be
let
go
unless
you
promise
to
go
forth
from
this
temple
without
bringing
one
with
and
death
knowing
that
heracles
could
hold
him
there
and
that
the
business
of
the
god
of
the
underworld
would
be
left
undone
if
he
were
held
promised
that
he
would
leave
the
temple
without
bringing
one
with
him
then
heracles
took
his
grip
off
death
and
that
stony
shape
went
from
the
temple
soon
a
flush
came
into
the
face
of
alcestis
as
heracles
watched
over
her
soon
she
arose
from
the
bier
on
which
she
had
been
laid
she
called
out
to
admetus
and
heracles
went
to
her
and
spoke
to
her
telling
her
that
he
would
bring
her

to
her
husband

house
iii
admetus
left
the
chamber
where
his
wife
had
lain
and
stood
before
the
door
of
his
palace
dawn
was
coming
and
as
he
looked
toward
the
temple
he
saw
heracles
coming
to
the
palace
a
woman
came
with
him
she
was
veiled
and
admetus
could
not
see
her
features
admetus
heracles
said
when
he
came
before
him
admetus
there
is
something
i
would
have
you
do
for
me
here
is
a
woman
whom
i
am
bringing
back
to
her
husband
i
won
her
from
an
enemy
will
you
not
take
her
into
your
house
while
i
am
away
on
a
journey
you
can
not
ask
me
to
do
this
heracles
said
admetus
no
woman
may
come
into
the
house
where
alcestis
only
yesterday
had
her
for
my
sake
take
her
into
your
house
said
heracles
come
now
admetus
take
this
woman
by
the
a
pang
came
to
admetus
as
he
looked
at
the
woman
who
stood
beside
heracles
and
saw
that
she
was
the
same
stature
as
his
lost
wife
he
thought
that
he
could
not
bear
to
take
her
hand
but
heracles
pleaded
with
him
and
he
took
her
by
the
hand
now
take
her
across
your
threshold
admetus
said
heracles
hardly
could
admetus
bear
to
do
could
he
bear
to
think
of
a
strange
woman
being
in
his
house
and
his
own
wife
gone
with
death
but
heracles
pleaded
with
him
and
by
the
hand
he
held
he
drew
the
woman
across
his
threshold
now
raise
her
veil
admetus
said
heracles
this
i
can
not
do
said
admetus
i
have
had
pangs
enough
how
can
i
look
upon
a
woman
s
face
and
remind
myself
that
i
can
not
look
upon
alcestis
s
face
ever
again
raise
her
veil
admetus
said
heracles
then
admetus
raised
the
veil
of
the
woman
he
had
taken
across
the
threshold
of
his
house
he
saw
the
face
of
alcestis
he
looked
again
upon
his
wife
brought
back
from
the
grip
of
death
by
heracles
the
son
of
zeus
and
then
a
deeper
joy
than
he
had
ever
known
came
to
admetus
once
more
his
wife
was
with
him
and
admetus
the
friend
of
apollo
and
the
friend
of
heracles
had
all
that
he
cared
to
have
vi
how
orpheus
the
minstrel
went
down
to
the
world
of
the
dead
decorative
first
letter
were
the
minstrels
who
in
the
early
days
went
through
the
world
telling
to
men
the
stories
of
the
gods
telling
of
their
wars
and
their
births
of
all
these
minstrels
none
was
so
famous
as
orpheus
who
had
gone
with
the
argonauts
none
could
tell
truer
things
about
the
gods
for
he
himself
was
half
divine
but
a
great
grief
came
to
orpheus
a
grief
that
stopped
his
singing
and
his
playing
upon
the
lyre
his
young
wife
eurydice
was
taken
from
him
one
day
walking
in
the
garden
she
was
bitten
on
the
heel
by
a
serpent
and
straightway
she
went
down
to
the
world
of
the
dead
then
everything
in
this
world
was
dark
and
bitter
for
the
minstrel
orpheus
sleep
would
not
come
to
him
and
for
him
food
had
no
taste
then
orpheus
said
i
will
do
that
which
no
mortal
has
ever
done
before
i
will
do
that
which
even
the
immortals
might
shrink
from
doing
i
will
go
down
into
the
world
of
the
dead
and
i
will
bring
back
to
the
living
and
to
the
light
my
bride
illustration
then
orpheus
went
on
his
way
to
the
valley
of
acherusia
which
goes
down
down
into
the
world
of
the
dead
he
would
never
have
found
his
way
to
that
valley
if
the
trees
had
not
shown
him
the
way
for
as
he
went
along
orpheus
played
upon
his
lyre
and
sang
and
the
trees
heard
his
song
and
they
were
moved
by
his
grief
and
with
their
arms
and
their
heads
they
showed
him
the
way
to
the
deep
deep
valley
of
acherusia
down
down
by
winding
paths
through
that
deepest
and
most
shadowy
of
all
valleys
orpheus
went
he
came
at
last
to
the
great
gate
that
opens
upon
the
world
of
the
dead
and
the
silent
guards
who
keep
watch
there
for
the
rulers
of
the
dead
were
affrighted
when
they
saw
a
living
being
and
they
would
not
let
orpheus
approach
the
gate
but
the
minstrel
knowing
the
reason
for
their
fear
said
i
am
not
heracles
come
again
to
drag
up
from
the
world
of
the
dead
your
dog
cerberus
i
am
orpheus
and
all
that
my
hands
can
do
is
to
make
music
upon
my
and
then
he
took
the
lyre
in
his
hands
and
played
upon
it
as
he
played
the
silent
watchers
gathered
around
him
leaving
the
gate
unguarded
and
as
he
played
the
rulers
of
the
dead
came
forth
aidoneus
and
persephone
and
listened
to
the
words
of
the
living
man
the
cause
of
my
coming
through
the
dark
and
fearful
ways
sang
orpheus
is
to
strive
to
gain
a
fairer
fate
for
eurydice
my
bride
all
that
is
above
must
come
down
to
you
at
last
o
rulers
of
the
most
lasting
world
but
before
her
time
has
eurydice
been
brought
here
i
have
desired
strength
to
endure
her
loss
but
i
can
not
endure
it
and
i
come
before
you
aidoneus
and
persephone
brought
here
by
when
orpheus
said
the
name
of
love
persephone
the
queen
of
the
dead
bowed
her
young
head
and
bearded
aidoneus
the
king
bowed
his
head
also
persephone
remembered
how
demeter
her
mother
had
sought
her
all
through
the
world
and
she
remembered
the
touch
of
her
mother
s
tears
upon
her
face
and
aidoneus
remembered
how
his
love
for
persephone
had
led
him
to
carry
her
away
from
the
valley
in
the
upper
world
where
she
had
been
gathering
flowers
he
and
persephone
bowed
their
heads
and
stood
aside
and
orpheus
went
through
the
gate
and
came
amongst
the
dead
still
upon
his
lyre
he
played
for
his
crimes
had
been
condemned
to
stand
up
to
his
neck
in
water
and
yet
never
be
able
to
assuage
his
heard
and
for
a
while
did
not
strive
to
put
his
lips
toward
the
water
that
ever
flowed
away
from
him
had
been
condemned
to
roll
up
a
hill
a
stone
that
ever
rolled
heard
the
music
that
orpheus
played
and
for
a
while
he
sat
still
upon
his
stone
and
even
those
dread
ones
who
bring
to
the
dead
the
memories
of
all
their
crimes
and
all
their
faults
even
the
eumenides
had
their
cheeks
wet
with
tears
in
the
throng
of
the
newly
come
dead
orpheus
saw
eurydice
she
looked
upon
her
husband
but
she
had
not
the
power
to
come
near
him
but
slowly
she
came
when
aidoneus
called
her
then
with
joy
orpheus
took
her
hands
it
would
be
granted
mortal
ever
gained
such
privilege
leave
both
together
the
world
of
the
dead
and
to
abide
for
another
space
in
the
world
of
the
living
one
condition
there
would
on
their
way
up
through
the
valley
of
acherusia
neither
orpheus
nor
eurydice
should
look
back
they
went
through
the
gate
and
came
amongst
the
watchers
that
are
around
the
portals
these
showed
them
the
path
that
went
up
through
the
valley
of
acherusia
that
way
they
went
orpheus
and
eurydice
he
going
before
her
up
and
up
through
the
darkened
ways
they
went
orpheus
knowing
that
eurydice
was
behind
him
but
never
looking
back
upon
her
but
as
he
went
his
heart
was
filled
with
things
to
the
trees
were
blossoming
in
the
garden
she
had
left
how
the
water
was
sparkling
in
the
fountain
how
the
doors
of
the
house
stood
open
and
how
they
sitting
together
would
watch
the
sunlight
on
the
laurel
bushes
all
these
things
were
in
his
heart
to
tell
her
to
tell
her
who
came
behind
him
silent
and
unseen
and
now
they
were
nearing
the
place
where
the
valley
of
acherusia
opened
on
the
world
of
the
living
orpheus
looked
on
the
blue
of
the
sky
a
bird
flew
by
orpheus
turned
around
and
cried
o
eurydice
look
upon
the
world
that
i
have
won
you
back
to
he
turned
to
say
this
to
her
he
saw
her
with
her
long
dark
hair
and
pale
face
he
held
out
his
arms
to
clasp
her
but
in
that
instant
she
slipped
back
into
the
depths
of
the
valley
and
all
he
heard
spoken
was
a
single
word
farewell
long
long
had
it
taken
eurydice
to
climb
so
far
but
in
the
moment
of
his
turning
around
she
had
fallen
back
to
her
place
amongst
the
dead
down
through
the
valley
of
acherusia
orpheus
went
again
again
he
came
before
the
watchers
of
the
gate
but
now
he
was
not
looked
at
nor
listened
to
and
hopeless
he
had
to
return
to
the
world
of
the
living
the
birds
were
his
friends
now
and
the
trees
and
the
stones
the
birds
flew
around
him
and
mourned
with
him
the
trees
and
stones
often
followed
him
moved
by
the
music
of
his
lyre
but
a
savage
band
slew
orpheus
and
threw
his
severed
head
and
his
lyre
into
the
river
hebrus
it
is
said
by
the
poets
that
while
they
floated
in
midstream
the
lyre
gave
out
some
mournful
notes
and
the
head
of
orpheus
answered
the
notes
with
song
and
now
that
he
was
no
longer
to
be
counted
with
the
living
orpheus
went
down
to
the
world
of
the
dead
not
going
now
by
that
steep
descent
through
the
valley
of
acherusia
but
going
down
straightway
the
silent
watchers
let
him
pass
and
he
went
amongst
the
dead
and
saw
his
eurydice
in
the
throng
again
they
were
together
orpheus
and
eurydice
and
as
they
went
through
the
place
that
king
aidoneus
ruled
over
they
had
no
fear
of
looking
back
one
upon
the
other

creon
was
proud
to
have
jason
in
his

but
of

the
king
was
fearful
for
he
had
heard
how
she
had
brought
about
the
death
of
apsyrtus
her
brother
medea
wearied
of
this
long
waiting
in
the
palace
of
king
creon
a
longing
came
upon
her
to
exercise
her
powers
of
enchantment
she
did
not
forget
what
queen
arete
had
said
to
if
she
wished
to
appease
the
wrath
of
the
gods
she
should
have
no
more
to

she
did
not

this
but
still
there
grew
in
her
a
longing
to
use
all
her
powers
of
enchantment
and
jason
at
the
court
of
king

had
his
longings

to
show

golden
fleece
that
he
had
won
he
longed
to
destroy

longed

for
thy
coming
to

kingship
o
he
should
have
remembered
then
the
words
of
queen
arete
to
medea
but
the
longing
that
he
had
for
his
triumph
and
his
revenge
was
in
the
way
of
his
remembering
he
said
o
medea
help
me
in
this
with
all
thine
enchantments
and
thou
wilt
be
more
dear
to
me
than
ever
before

then
went
forth
from
the
palace
of
king
creon
and
she
made
more
terrible
spells
than
ever
she
had
made
in
colchis
all
night
she
stayed
in
a
tangled
place
weaving
her
spells
dawn
came
and
she
knew
that
the
spells
she
had
woven
had
not
been
in
vain
for
beside
her
there
stood
a
car
that
was
drawn
by
dragons
medea
the
enchantress
had
never
looked
on
these
dragon
shapes
before
when
she
looked
upon
them
now
she
was
fearful
of
them
but
then
she
said
to
herself
i
am
medea
and
i
would
be
a
greater
enchantress
and
a
more
cunning
woman
than
i
have
been
and
what
i
have
thought
of
that
will
i
carry
she
mounted
the
car
drawn
by
the
dragons
and
in
the
first
light
of
the
day
she
went
from
corinth
illustration
to
the
places
where
grew
the
herbs
of
magic

journeyed
in
her
the
mountains
ossa
pelion
œthrys
pindus
and
olympus
then
to
the
rivers
apidanus
enipeus
and
peneus
she
gathered
herbs
on
the
mountains
and
grasses
on
the
rivers
banks
some
she
plucked
up
by
the
roots
and
some
she
cut
with
the
curved
blade
of
a
knife
when
she
had
gathered
these
herbs
and
grasses
she
went
back
to
corinth
on
her
car
then
jason
saw
her
pale
and
drawn
was
her
face
and
her
eyes
were
strange
and
gleaming
he
saw
her
standing
by
the
car
drawn
by
the
dragons
and
a
terror
of
medea
came
into
his
mind
he
went
toward
her
but
in
a
harsh
voice
she
bade
him
not
come
near
to
disturb
the
brewing
that
she
was
going
to
begin
jason
turned
away
as
he
went
toward
the
palace
he
saw
glauce
king
creon
s
daughter
the
maiden
was
coming
from
the
well
and
she
carried
a
pitcher
of
water
he
thought
how
fair
glauce
looked
in
the
light
of
the
morning
how
the
wind
played
with
her
hair
and
her
garments
and
how
far
away
she
was
from
witcheries
and
enchantments
as
for
medea
she
placed
in
a
heap
beside
her
the
magic
herbs
and
grasses
she
had
gathered
then
she
put
them
in
a
bronze
pot
and
boiled
them
in
water
from
the
stream
soon
froth
came
on
the
boiling
and
medea
stirred
the
pot
with
a
withered
branch
of
an
apple
tree
the
branch
was
was
indeed
no
more
than
a
dry
stick
but
as
she
stirred
the
herbs
and
grasses
with
it
first
leaves
then
flowers
and
lastly
bright
gleaming
apples
came
on
it
and
when
the
pot
boiled
over
and
drops
from
it
fell
upon
the
ground
there
grew
up
out
of
the
dry
earth
soft
grasses
and
flowers
such
was
the
power
of
renewal
that
was
in
the
magical
brew
that
medea
had
made
she
filled
a
phial
with
the
liquid
she
had
brewed
and
she
scattered
the
rest
in
the
wild
places
of
the
garden
then
taking
the
phial
and
the
apples
that
had
grown
on
the
withered
branch
she
mounted
the
car
drawn
by
the
dragons
and
she
went
once
more
from
corinth
on
she
journeyed
in
her
car
until
she
came
to
a
place
that
was
near
to
iolcus
there
the
dragons
descended
they
had
come
to
a
dark
pool
medea
making
herself
naked
stood
in
that
dark
pool
for
a
while
she
looked
down
upon
herself
seeing
in
the
dark
water
her
white
body
and
her
lovely
hair
then
she
bathed
herself
in
the
water
soon
a
dread
change
came
over
her
she
saw
her
hair
become
scant
and
gray
and
she
saw
her
body
become
bent
and
withered
she
stepped
out
of
the
pool
a
withered
and
witchlike
woman
when
she
dressed
herself
the
rich
clothes
that
she
had
worn
before
hung
loosely
upon
her
and
she
looked
the
more
forbidding
because
of
them
she
bade
the
dragons
go
and
they
flew
through
the
air
with
the
empty
car
then
she
hid
in
her
dress
the
phial
with
the
liquid
she
had
brewed
and
the
apples
that
had
grown
upon
the
withered
branch
she
picked
up
a
stick
to
lean
upon
and
with
the
gait
of
an
ancient
woman
she
went
hobbling
upon
the
road
to
iolcus
on
the
streets
of
the
city
the
fierce
fighting
men
that
pelias
had
brought
down
from
the
mountains
showed
themselves
few
of
the
men
or
women
of
the
city
showed
themselves
even
in
the
daytime
medea
went
through
the
city
and
to
the
palace
of
king
pelias
but
no
one
might
enter
there
and
the
guards
laid
hands
upon
her
and
held
her
medea
did
not
struggle
with
them
she
drew
from
the
folds
of
her
dress
one
of
the
gleaming
apples
that
she
carried
and
she
gave
it
to
one
of
the
guards
it
is
for
king
pelias
she
said
give
the
apple
to
him
and
then
do
with
me
as
the
king
would
have
you
the
guards
brought
the
gleaming
apple
to
the
king
when
he
had
taken
it
into
his
hand
and
had
smelled
its
fragrance
old
trembling
pelias
asked
where
the
apple
had
come
from
the
guards
told
him
it
had
been
brought
by
an
ancient
woman
who
was
now
outside
seated
on
a
stone
in
the
courtyard
he
looked
on
the
shining
apple
and
he
felt
its
fragrance
and
he
could
not
help
thinking
old
trembling
pelias
that
this
apple
might
be
the
means
of
bringing
him
back
to
the
fullness
of
health
and
courage
that
he
had
had
before
he
sent
for
the
ancient
woman
who
had
brought
it
that
she
might
tell
him
where
it
had
come
from
and
who
it
was
that
had
sent
it
to
him
then
the
guards
brought
medea
before
him
she
saw
an
old
man
and
trembling
with
shaking
hands
and
eyes
that
looked
on
her
fearfully
who
are
you
he
asked
and
from
whence
came
the
apple
that
you
had
them
bring
me
medea
standing
before
him
looked
a
withered
and
shrunken
beldame
a
woman
bent
with
years
but
yet
with
eyes
that
were
bright
and
living
she
came
near
him
and
she
said
the
apple
o
king
came
from
the
garden
that
is
watched
over
by
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
he
who
eats
it
has
a
little
of
the
weight
of
old
age
taken
from
him
but
things
more
wonderful
even
than
the
shining
apples
grow
in
that
far
garden
there
are
plants
there
the
juices
of
which
make
youthful
again
all
aged
and
failing
things
the
apple
would
bring
you
a
little
way
toward
the
vigor
of
your
prime
but
the
juices
i
have
can
bring
you
to
a
time
more
even
to
the
strength
and
the
glory
of
your
when
the
king
heard
her
say
this
a
light
came
into
his
heavy
eyes
and
his
hands
caught
medea
and
drew
her
to
him
who
are
you
he
cried
who
speak
of
the
garden
watched
over
by
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
who
are
you
who
speak
of
juices
that
can
bring
back
one
to
the
strength
and
glory
of
his
youth
medea
answered
i
am
a
woman
who
has
known
many
and
great
griefs
o
king
my
griefs
have
brought
me
through
the
world
many
have
searched
for
the
garden
watched
over
by
the
daughters
of
the
evening
land
but
i
came
to
it
unthinkingly
and
without
wanting
them
i
gathered
the
gleaming
apples
and
took
from
the
plants
there
the
juices
that
can
bring
youth
pelias
said
if
you
have
been
able
to
come
by
those
juices
how
is
it
that
you
remain
in
woeful
age
and
decrepitude
she
said
because
of
my
many
griefs
king
i
would
not
renew
my
life
i
would
be
ever
nearer
death
and
the
end
of
all
things
but
you
are
a
king
and
have
all
things
you
desire
at
your
and
state
and
power
surely
if
any
one
would
desire
it
you
would
desire
to
have
youth
back
to
pelias
when
he
heard
her
say
this
knew
that
besides
youth
there
was
nothing
that
he
desired
after
crimes
that
had
gone
through
the
whole
of
his
manhood
he
had
secured
for
himself
the
kingdom
that
cretheus
had
founded
but
old
age
had
come
on
him
and
the
weakness
of
old
age
and
the
power
he
had
won
was
falling
from
his
hands
he
would
be
overthrown
in
his
weakness
or
else
he
would
soon
come
to
die
and
there
would
be
an
end
then
to
his
name
and
to
his
kingship
how
fortunate
above
all
kings
he
would
be
he
thought
if
it
could
be
that
some
one
should
come
to
him
with
juices
that
would
renew
his
youth
he
looked
longingly
into
the
eyes
of
the
woman
before
him
and
he
said
how
is
it
that
you
show
no
gains
from
the
juices
that
you
speak
of
you
are
old
and
in
woeful
decrepitude
even
if
you
would
not
win
back
to
youth
you
could
have
got
riches
and
state
for
that
which
you
say
you
then
medea
said
i
have
lost
so
much
and
have
suffered
so
much
that
i
would
not
have
youth
back
at
the
price
of
facing
the
years
i
would
sink
down
to
the
quiet
of
the
grave
but
i
hope
for
some
ease
before
i
the
ease
that
is
in
king
s
houses
with
good
food
to
eat
and
rest
and
servants
to
wait
upon
one
s
aged
body
these
are
the
things
i
desire
o
pelias
even
as
you
desire
youth
you
can
give
me
such
things
and
i
have
come
to
you
who
desire
youth
eagerly
rather
than
to
kings
who
have
a
less
eager
desire
for
it
to
you
i
will
give
the
juices
that
bring
one
back
to
the
strength
and
the
glory
of
pelias
said
i
have
only
your
word
for
it
that
you
possess
these
juices
many
there
are
who
come
and
say
deceiving
things
to
a
said
medea
let
there
be
no
more
words
between
us
o
king
i
will
show
you
the
virtue
of
the
juices
i
have
brought
with
me
have
a
great
vat
vat
that
a
man
could
lay
himself
in
with
the
water
covering
him
have
this
vat
filled
with
water
and
bring
to
it
the
oldest
creature
you
can
ram
or
a
goat
that
is
the
oldest
of
their
flock
do
this
o
king
and
you
will
be
shown
a
thing
to
wonder
at
and
to
be
hopeful
so
medea
said
and
then
she
turned
around
and
left
the
king
s
presence
pelias
called
to
his
guards
and
he
bade
them
take
the
woman
into
their
charge
and
treat
her
considerately
the
guards
took
medea
away
then
all
day
the
king
mused
on
what
had
been
told
him
and
a
wild
hope
kept
beating
about
his
heart
he
had
the
servants
prepare
a
great
vat
in
the
lower
chambers
and
he
had
his
shepherd
bring
him
a
ram
that
was
the
oldest
in
the
flock
only
medea
was
permitted
to
come
into
that
chamber
with
the
king
the
ways
to
it
were
guarded
and
all
that
took
place
in
it
was
secret
medea
was
brought
to
the
closed
door
by
her
guard
she
opened
it
and
she
saw
the
king
there
and
the
vat
already
prepared
she
saw
a
ram
tethered
near
the
vat
medea
looked
upon
the
king
in
the
light
of
the
torches
his
face
was
white
and
fierce
and
his
mouth
moved
gaspingly
she
spoke
to
him
quietly
and
said
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
hear
me
speak
you
will
watch
a
great
miracle
for
behold
the
ram
which
is
the
oldest
and
feeblest
in
the
flock
will
become
young
and
invigorated
when
it
comes
forth
from
this
she
untethered
the
ram
and
with
the
help
of
pelias
drew
it
to
the
vat
this
was
not
hard
to
do
for
the
beast
was
very
feeble
its
feet
could
hardly
bear
it
upright
its
wool
was
yellow
and
stayed
only
in
patches
on
its
shrunken
body
easily
the
beast
was
forced
into
the
vat
then
medea
drew
the
phial
out
of
her
bosom
and
poured
into
the
water
some
of
the
brew
she
had
made
in
creon
s
garden
in
corinth
the
water
in
the
vat
took
on
a
strange
bubbling
and
the
ram
sank
down
then
medea
standing
beside
the
vat
sang
an
incantation
o
earth
she
sang
o
earth
who
dost
provide
wise
men
with
potent
herbs
o
earth
help
me
now
i
am
she
who
can
drive
the
clouds
i
am
she
who
can
dispel
the
winds
i
am
she
who
can
break
the
jaws
of
serpents
with
my
incantations
i
am
she
who
can
uproot
living
trees
and
rocks
who
can
make
the
mountains
shake
who
can
bring
the
ghosts
from
their
tombs
o
earth
help
me
at
this
strange
incantation
the
mixture
in
the
vat
boiled
and
bubbled
more
and
more
then
the
boiling
and
bubbling
ceased
up
to
the
surface
came
the
ram
medea
helped
it
to
struggle
out
of
the
vat
and
then
it
turned
and
smote
the
vat
with
its
head
pelias
took
down
a
torch
and
stood
before
the
beast
vigorous
indeed
was
the
ram
and
its
wool
was
white
and
grew
evenly
upon
it
they
could
not
tether
it
again
and
when
the
servants
were
brought
into
the
chamber
it
took
two
of
them
to
drag
away
the
ram
the
king
was
most
eager
to
enter
the
vat
and
have
medea
put
in
the
brew
and
speak
the
incantation
over
it
but
medea
bade
him
wait
until
the
morrow
all
night
the
king
lay
awake
thinking
of
how
he
might
regain
his
youth
and
his
strength
and
be
secure
and
triumphant
thereafter
at
the
first
light
he
sent
for
medea
and
he
told
her
that
he
would
have
the
vat
made
ready
and
that
he
would
go
into
it
that
night
medea
looked
upon
him
and
the
helplessness
that
he
showed
made
her
want
to
work
a
greater
evil
upon
him
or
if
not
upon
him
upon
his
house
how
soon
it
would
have
reached
its
end
all
her
plot
for
the
destruction
of
this
king
but
she
would
leave
in
the
king
s
house
a
misery
that
would
not
have
an
end
so
soon
so
she
said
to
the
king
i
would
say
the
incantation
over
a
beast
of
the
field
but
over
a
king
i
could
not
say
it
let
those
of
your
own
blood
be
with
you
when
you
enter
the
vat
that
will
bring
such
change
to
you
have
your
daughters
there
i
will
give
them
the
juice
to
mix
in
the
vat
and
i
will
teach
them
the
incantation
that
has
to
be
so
she
said
and
she
made
pelias
consent
to
having
his
daughters
and
not
medea
in
the
chamber
of
the
vat
they
were
sent
for
and
they
came
before
medea
the
daughters
of
king
pelias
they
were
women
who
had
been
borne
down
by
the
tyranny
of
their
father
they
stood
before
him
now
two
creatures
very
feeble
and
fearful
to
them
medea
gave
the
phial
that
had
in
it
the
liquid
to
mix
in
the
vat
also
she
taught
them
the
words
of
the
incantation
but
she
taught
them
to
use
these
words
wrongly
the
vat
was
prepared
in
the
lower
chambers
pelias
and
his
daughters
went
there
and
the
chamber
was
guarded
and
what
happened
there
was
in
secret
pelias
went
into
the
vat
the
brew
was
thrown
into
it
and
the
vat
boiled
and
bubbled
as
before
pelias
sank
down
in
it
over
him
then
his
daughters
said
the
magic
words
as
medea
had
taught
them
pelias
sank
down
but
he
did
not
rise
again
the
hours
went
past
and
the
morning
came
and
the
daughters
of
king
pelias
raised
frightened
laments
over
the
sides
of
the
vat
the
mixture
boiled
and
bubbled
and
pelias
was
to
be
seen
at
the
bottom
with
his
limbs
stiffened
in
death
then
the
guards
came
and
they
took
king
pelias
out
of
the
vat
and
left
him
in
his
royal
chamber
the
word
went
through
the
palace
that
the
king
was
dead
there
was
a
hush
in
the
palace
then
but
not
the
hush
of
grief
one
by
one
servants
and
servitors
stole
away
from
the
palace
that
was
hated
by
all
then
there
was
clatter
in
the
streets
as
the
fierce
fighting
men
from
the
mountains
galloped
away
with
what
plunder
they
could
seize
and
through
all
this
the
daughters
of
king
pelias
sat
crouching
in
fear
above
the
body
of
their
father
and
medea
still
an
ancient
woman
seemingly
went
through
the
crowds
that
now
came
on
the
streets
of
the
city
she
told
those
she
went
amongst
that
the
son
of
æson
was
alive
and
would
soon
be
in
their
midst
hearing
this
the
men
of
the
city
formed
a
council
of
elders
to
rule
the
people
until
jason
s
coming
in
such
way
medea
brought
about
the
end
of
king
pelias
s
reign
in
triumph
she
went
through
the
city
but
as
she
was
passing
the
temple
her
dress
was
caught
and
held
and
turning
around
she
faced
the
ancient
priestess
of
artemis
iphias
thou
art
æetes
s
daughter
iphias
said
who
in
deceit
didst
come
into
iolcus
woe
to
thee
and
woe
to
jason
for
what
thou
hast
done
this
day
not
for
the
slaying
of
pelias
art
thou
blameworthy
but
for
the
misery
that
thou
hast
brought
upon
his
daughters
by
bringing
them
into
the
guilt
of
the
slaying
go
from
the
city
daughter
of
king
æetes
never
never
wilt
thou
come
back
into
but
little
heed
did
medea
pay
to
the
ancient
priestess
iphias
still
in
the
guise
of
an
old
woman
she
went
through
the
streets
of
the
city
and
out
through
the
gate
and
along
the
highway
that
led
from
iolcus
to
that
dark
pool
she
came
where
she
had
bathed
herself
before
but
now
she
did
not
step
into
the
pool
nor
pour
its
water
over
her
shrinking
flesh
instead
she
built
up
two
altars
of
green
altar
to
youth
and
an
altar
to
hecate
queen
of
the
witches
she
wreathed
them
with
green
boughs
from
the
forest
and
she
prayed
before
each
then
she
made
herself
naked
and
she
anointed
herself
with
the
brew
she
had
made
from
the
magical
herbs
and
grasses
all
marks
of
age
and
decrepitude
left
her
and
when
she
stood
over
the
dark
pool
and
looked
down
on
herself
she
saw
that
her
body
was
white
and
shapely
as
before
and
that
her
hair
was
soft
and
lovely
illustration
she
stayed
all
night
between
the
tangled
wood
and
the
dark
pool
and
with
the
first
light
the
car
drawn
by
the
scaly
dragons
came
to
her
she
mounted
the
car
and
she
journeyed
back
to
corinth
into
jason
s
mind
a
fear
of
medea
had
come
since
the
hour
when
he
had
seen
her
mount
the
car
drawn
by
the
scaly
dragons
he
could
not
think
of
her
any
more
as
the
one
who
had
been
his
companion
on
the
he
thought
of
her
as
one
who
could
help
him
and
do
wonderful
things
for
him
but
not
as
one
whom
he
could
talk
softly
and
lovingly
to
ah
but
if
jason
had
thought
less
of
his
kingdom
and
less
of
his
triumphing
with
the
fleece
of
gold
medea
would
not
have
had
the
dragons
come
to
her
and
now
that
his
love
for
medea
had
altered
jason
noted
the
loveliness
of
glauce
the
daughter
of
creon
the
king
of
corinth
and
glauce
who
had
red
lips
and
the
eyes
of
a
child
saw
in
jason
who
had
brought
the
golden
fleece
out
of
colchis
the
image
of
every
hero
she
had
heard
about
in
stories
creon
the
king
often
brought
jason
and
glauce
together
for
his
hope
was
that
the
hero
would
wed
his
daughter
and
stay
in
corinth
and
strengthen
his
kingdom
he
thought
that
medea
that
strange
woman
could
not
keep
a
companionship
with
jason
two
were
walking
in
the
king
s
garden
and
they
were
jason
and
glauce
a
shadow
fell
between
them
and
when
jason
looked
up
he
saw
medea
s
dragon
car
down
flew
the
dragons
and
medea
came
from
the
car
and
stood
between
jason
and
the
princess
angrily
she
spoke
to
him
i
have
made
the
kingdom
ready
for
your
return
she
said
but
if
you
would
go
there
you
must
first
let
me
deal
in
my
own
way
with
this
pretty
and
so
fiercely
did
medea
look
upon
her
that
glauce
shrank
back
and
clung
to
jason
for
protection
o
jason
she
cried
thou
didst
say
that
i
am
such
a
one
as
thou
didst
dream
of
when
in
the
forest
with
chiron
before
the
adventure
of
the
golden
fleece
drew
thee
away
from
the
grecian
lands
oh
save
me
now
from
the
power
of
her
who
comes
in
the
dragon
and
jason
said
i
said
all
that
thou
hast
said
and
i
will
protect
thee
o
and
then
medea
thought
of
the
king
s
house
she
had
left
for
jason
and
of
the
brother
whom
she
had
let
be
slain
and
of
the
plot
she
had
carried
out
to
bring
jason
back
to
iolcus
and
a
great
fury
came
over
her
in
her
hand
she
took
foam
from
the
jaws
of
the
dragons
and
she
cast
the
foam
upon
glauce
and
the
princess
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
jason
with
the
dragon
foam
burning
into
her
then
seeing
in
his
eyes
that
he
had
forgotten
all
that
he
owed
to
winning
of
the
golden
fleece
and
the
safety
of
and
the
destruction
of
the
power
of
king
in
his
eyes
that
jason
had
forgotten
all
this
medea
went
into
her
car
and
spoke
the
words
that
made
the
scaly
dragons
bear
her
aloft
she
flew
from
corinth
leaving
jason
in
king
creon
s
garden
with
glauce
dying
in
his
arms
he
lifted
her
up
and
laid
her
upon
a
bed
but
even
as
her
friends
came
around
her
the
daughter
of
king
creon
died
decorative
first
letter
jason
for
long
he
stayed
in
corinth
a
famous
man
indeed
but
one
sorrowful
and
alone
but
again
there
grew
in
him
the
desire
to
rule
and
to
have
possessions
he
called
around
him
again
the
men
whose
home
was
in
who
had
followed
him
as
youths
when
he
first
proclaimed
his
purpose
of
winning
the
fleece
of
gold
he
called
them
around
him
and
he
led
them
on
board
the
once
more
they
lifted
sails
and
once
more
they
took
the
into
the
open
sea
toward
iolcus
they
sailed
their
passage
was
fortunate
and
in
a
short
time
they
brought
the
safely
into
the
harbor
of
pagasæ
oh
happy
were
the
crowds
that
came
thronging
to
see
the
ship
that
had
the
famous
fleece
of
gold
upon
her
masthead
and
green
and
sweet
smelling
were
the
garlands
that
the
people
brought
to
wreathe
the
heads
of
jason
and
his
companions
jason
looked
upon
the
throngs
and
he
thought
that
much
had
gone
from
him
but
he
thought
that
whatever
else
had
gone
something
remained
to
be
a
king
and
a
great
ruler
over
a
people
and
so
jason
came
back
to
iolcus
the
he
made
a
blazing
pile
of
in
sacrifice
to
poseidon
the
god
of
the
sea
the
golden
fleece
he
hung
in
the
temple
of
the
gods
then
he
took
up
the
rule
of
the
kingdom
that
cretheus
had
founded
and
he
became
the
greatest
of
the
kings
of
greece
and
to
iolcus
there
came
year
after
year
young
men
who
would
look
upon
the
gleaming
thing
that
was
hung
there
in
the
temple
of
the
gods
and
as
they
looked
upon
it
young
man
after
young
man
the
thought
would
come
to
each
that
he
would
make
himself
strong
enough
and
heroic
enough
to
win
for
his
country
something
as
precious
as
jason
s
golden
fleece
and
for
all
their
lives
they
kept
in
mind
the
words
that
jason
had
inscribed
upon
a
pillar
that
was
placed
beside
the
fleece
of
words
that
triton
spoke
to
the
argonauts
when
they
were
fain
to
win
their
way
out
of
the
inland
sea
that
is
the
outlet
to
the
sea
where
the
deep
water
lies
unmoved
and
dark
on
each
side
roll
white
breakers
with
shining
crests
and
the
way
between
for
your
passage
out
is
narrow
but
go
in
joy
and
as
for
labor
let
there
be
no
grieving
that
limbs
in
youthful
vigor
should
still
toil
