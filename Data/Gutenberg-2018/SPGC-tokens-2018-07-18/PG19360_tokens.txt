dedication
to
miss
eleanor
lloyd
my
dear
eleanor
i
wish
that
this
little
volume
were
worthier
of
being
dedicated
to
you
it
is
i
fear
fragmentary
as
a
mere
tale
and
can
not
even
plead
as
an
excuse
for
this
that
it
embodies
any
complete
theory
on
the
vexed
question
of
the
upbringing
of
girls
indeed
i
should
like
to
say
that
it
contains
no
attempt
to
paint
a
model
girl
or
a
model
education
and
was
originally
written
as
a
sketch
of
domestic
life
and
not
as
a
vehicle
for
theories
that
it
does
touch
by
the
way
on
a
few
of
the
many
strong
opinions
i
have
on
the
subject
you
will
readily
discover
though
it
is
so
long
since
we
held
discussions
together
that
i
hardly
know
how
far
your
views
will
now
agree
with
mine
if
however
it
seems
to
you
to
illustrate
a
belief
in
the
joys
and
benefits
of
intellectual
hobbies
i
do
not
think
that
we
shall
differ
on
that
point
and
it
may
serve
here
and
there
to
recall
one
nearly
as
dear
to
you
as
to
me
for
whom
the
pleasures
of
life
were
at
least
doubled
by
such
interests
and
who
found
in
them
no
mean
resource
under
a
burden
heavier
than
common
of
life
pain
that
whatever
labour
i
may
spend
on
this
or
any
other
bit
of
work
whatever
changes
or
confirmations
time
and
experience
may
bring
to
my
views
of
people
and
things
i
can
not
now
ask
her
approval
of
the
one
or
delight
in
the
play
of
her
strong
intellect
and
bright
wit
over
the
other
is
an
unhealable
sorrow
with
which
no
one
sympathizes
more
fully
than
you
this
story
was
written
before
her
death
it
has
been
revised
without
her
help
such
as
it
is
i
beg
you
to
accept
it
in
affectionate

eleanor
and
i
are
subject
to
indeed
it
is
a
family
failing
by
the
family
i
mean
our
household
for
eleanor
and
i
are
not
even
distantly
related
life
would
be
comparatively
dull
up
away
here
on
the
moors
without
them
our
fads
and
the
boys
fads
are
sometimes
the
same
but
oftener
distinct
our
present
one
we
would
not
so
much
as
tell
them
of
on
any
account
because
they
would
laugh
at
us
it
is
this
we
purpose
this
winter
to
write
the
stories
of
our
own
lives
down
to
the
present
date
it
seems
an
egotistical
and
perhaps
silly
thing
to
record
the
trivialities
of
our
everyday
lives
even
for
fun
and
just
to
please
ourselves
i
said
so
to
eleanor
but
she
said
supposing
pepys
had
thought
so
about
his
everyday
life
how
much
instruction
and
amusement
would
have
been
lost
to
the
readers
of
his
diary
to
which
i
replied
that
as
pepys
lived
in
stirring
times
and
amongst
notable
people
daily
life
was
like
a
leaf
out
of
english
history
and
his
case
quite
different
to
the
case
of
obscure
persons
living
simply
and
monotonously
on
the
yorkshire
moors
on
which
eleanor
observed
that
the
simple
and
truthful
history
of
a
single
mind
from
childhood
would
be
as
valuable
if
it
could
be
got
as
the
whole
of
pepys
diary
from
the
first
volume
to
the
last
and
when
eleanor
makes
a
general
observation
of
this
kind
in
her
conclusive
tone
i
very
seldom
dispute
it
for
to
begin
with
she
is
generally
right
and
then
she
is
so
much
more
clever
than
i
one
result
of
the
confessed
superiority
of
her
opinion
to
mine
is
that
i
give
way
to
it
sometimes
even
when
i
am
not
quite
convinced
but
only
helped
by
a
little
reason
of
my
own
in
the
background
i
gave
way
in
this
instance
not
altogether
to
her
argument
for
i
am
sure
biography
will
not
be
the
history
of
a
mind
but
only
a
record
of
small
facts
important
to
no
one
but
myself
but
chiefly
because
i
think
that
as
one
grows
up
one
enjoys
recalling
the
things
that
happened
when
one
was
little
and
one
forgets
them
so
soon
i
envy
eleanor
for
having
kept
her
childish
diaries
i
used
to
write
diaries
too
but
when
i
was
fourteen
years
old
i
got
so
much
ashamed
of
them
it
made
me
quite
hot
to
read
my
small
moral
reflections
and
the
pompous
account
of
my
quarrels
with
matilda
my
sentimental
admiration
for
the
handsome
bandmaster
even
when
alone
and
i
was
so
afraid
of
the
boys
getting
hold
of
them
that
i
made
a
big
hole
in
the
kitchen
fire
one
day
and
burned
them
all
at
least
so
i
thought
but
one
volume
escaped
the
flames
and
the
fun
eleanor
and
i
have
now
in
this
has
made
me
regret
that
i
burned
the
others
of
course
even
if
i
put
down
all
that
i
can
remember
it
will
not
be
like
having
kept
my
diaries
eleanor
biography
in
this
respect
will
be
much
better
than
mine
but
still
i
remember
a
good
deal
now
that
i
dare
say
i
shall
forget
soon
and
in
sixteen
more
years
these
histories
may
amuse
us
as
much
as
the
old
diaries
we
are
all
growing
up
now
we
have
even
got
to
speaking
of
old
times
by
which
we
mean
the
times
when
we
used
to
wade
in
the
brooks
and
but
this
is
beside
the
mark
and
i
must
not
allow
myself
to
wander
off
i
am
too
apt
to
be
discursive
when
i
had
to
write
leading
articles
for
our
manuscript
periodical
jack
used
to
laugh
at
me
and
say
if
it
was
for
eleanor
disentangling
your
sentences
you
put
parenthesis
within
parenthesis
till
when
you
got
yourself
into
the
very
inside
one
you
be
as
puzzled
as
a
pig
in
a
labyrinth
and
not
know
how
to
get
back
to
where
you
started
from
and
i
remember
clement
who
generally
disputed
a
point
if
possible
said
how
do
you
know
she
would
get
back
if
you
let
her
work
out
each
train
of
thought
in
peace
the
curt
french
style
may
suit
some
people
whose
brains
wo
stretch
far
without
getting
tired
but
others
may
have
more
sympathy
with
a
semitic
cast
of
mind
this
excuse
pleased
me
very
much
it
was
pleasanter
to
believe
that
my
style
was
semitic
than
to
allow
with
jack
that
it
tended
towards
that
of
nickleby
though
at
that
time
my
notion
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
semitic
was
not
so
precise
as
it
might
have
been
our
home
is
a
beautiful
place
in
the
summer
and
in
much
of
spring
and
autumn
in
winter
i
fancy
it
would
look
dreary
to
the
eyes
of
strangers
at
night
the
wind
comes
over
the
top
of
deadmanstone
hill
and
down
the
valley
whirls
the
last
leaves
off
the
old
trees
by
the
church
and
sends
them
dancing
over
the
gravestones
then
up
through
the
village
it
comes
and
moans
round
our
house
all
night
like
some
miserable
being
wanting
to
get
in
the
boys
say
it
does
get
in
more
than
enough
especially
into
their
bedrooms
but
then
boys
always
grumble
it
certainly
makes
strange
noises
here
i
have
more
than
once
opened
the
late
in
the
evening
because
i
fancied
that
one
of
the
dogs
had
been
hurt
and
was
groaning
outside
that
stormy
winter
after
the
ladybrig
murder
our
fancies
and
the
wind
together
played
eleanor
and
me
sad
tricks
when
once
we
began
to
listen
we
seemed
to
hear
a
whole
tragedy
going
on
close
outside
we
could
distinguish
footsteps
and
voices
through
the
bluster
and
then
a
struggle
in
the
shrubbery
and
a
and
a
groan
and
then
a
roar
of
wind
half
drowning
the
sound
of
flying
footsteps
and
then
an
awful
pause
and
at
last
faint
groaning
and
a
bump
as
of
some
poor
wounded
body
falling
against
the
house
at
this
point
we
were
wont
to
summon
courage
and
rush
out
with
the
kitchen
poker
and
a
candle
shapeless
with
tallow
shrouds
from
the
strong
draughts
we
never
could
see
anything
partly
perhaps
because
the
candle
was
always
blown
out
and
when
we
stood
outside
it
became
evident
that
what
we
had
heard
was
only
the
wind
and
a
bough
of
the
old
which
beat
at
intervals
upon
the
house
when
the
nights
are
stormy
there
is
no
room
so
comfortable
as
the
big
kitchen
we
first
used
it
for
parochial
purposes
small
and
so
forth
then
one
evening
as
we
strolled
in
to
look
for
one
of
the
dogs
the
cook
said
you
can
sit
here
if
you
like
miss
eleanor
always
sits
in
the
pantry
on
winter
nights
so
there
be
no
one
to
disturb
you
and
as
we
had
some
writing
on
hand
which
we
did
not
wish
to
have
discussed
or
overlooked
by
other
members
of
the
family
we
settled
down
in
great
peace
and
comfort
by
the
roaring
fire
which
the
maids
had
heaped
to
keep
the
kitchen
warm
in
their
absence
we
found
ourselves
so
cosy
and
independent
that
we
returned
again
and
again
to
our
new
study
the
boys
who
go
away
a
great
deal
more
than
we
do
and
are
apt
to
come
back
dissatisfied
with
our
ways
and
anxious
to
make
us
more
like
other
people
object
strongly
to
this
habit
of
ours
they
say
who
ever
of
ladies
sitting
in
the
kitchen
and
indeed
there
are
many
kitchens
in
which
i
should
not
at
all
like
to
sit
but
we
have
this
large
airy
spotlessly
clean
room
with
its
stone
floor
its
walls
its
tables
scrubbed
to
snowy
whiteness
its
quaint
old
dresser
and
clock
and
corner
cupboards
of
shiny
black
oak
and
its
huge
and
blazing
fire
all
to
ourselves
and
we
have
abundance
of
room
and
may
do
anything
we
please
so
i
think
it
is
no
wonder
that
we
like
it
though
it
be
in
point
of
fact
a
kitchen
we
cover
the
table
and
commonly
part
of
the
floor
with
an
amount
of
books
papers
and
belongings
of
various
sorts
such
as
we
should
scruple
to
deluge
the
with
the
fire
crackles
and
blazes
so
that
we
do
not
mind
the
wind
though
there
are
no
blinds
to
the
kitchen
and
if
we
do
not
cotter
the
shutters
we
look
out
upon
the
black
night
and
the
tall
scotch
pine
that
has
been
tossed
so
wildly
for
so
many
years
and
is
not
torn
down
yet
keziah
the
cook
takes
much
pride
in
this
same
kitchen
which
partly
accounts
for
its
being
in
a
state
so
suitable
to
our
use
she
stones
the
floor
with
excruciating
regularity
at
least
some
people
hate
the
scraping
sound
i
do
not
mind
it
myself
she
the
hearth
in
fantastic
patterns
the
chests
the
old
chairs
the
settle
the
dresser
the
clock
and
the
corner
cupboards
are
so
many
mirrors
from
constant
polishing
she
says
with
justice
that
a
body
might
eat
his
dinner
off
anything
in
the
place
we
dine
early
and
the
cooking
for
the
late
supper
is
performed
in
what
we
call
the
second
kitchen
beyond
this
i
believe
that
what
is
now
the
vicarage
was
originally
an
old
farmhouse
of
which
this
same
charming
kitchen
was
the
chief
it
is
quite
a
journey
through
long
low
passages
to
get
from
the
modern
part
of
the
house
to
this
one
year
when
the
languages
fad
was
strong
upon
us
eleanor
and
i
earned
many
a
backache
by
carrying
the
huge
volumes
of
the
italian
dictionary
from
the
shelves
to
the
kitchen
we
piled
them
on
the
oak
chest
for
reference
and
ran
backwards
and
forwards
to
them
from
the
table
where
we
sat
and
beat
our
brains
over
the
divina
commedia
while
the
wind
growled
in
the
tall
old
without
and
the
dogs
growled
in
dreams
upon
the
hearth
it
is
by
this
table
in
this
kitchen
that
our
biographies
are
to
be
written
they
can
not
be
penned
under
the
noses
of
the
boys
eleanor
finds
rocking
a
help
to
composition
and
she
is
swinging
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
glossy
old
with
a
pen
between
her
lips
and
a
vacant
gaze
in
her
eyes
that
becomes
almost
a
look
of
inspiration
when
the
swing
of
the
chair
turns
her
face
towards
the
ceiling
for
my
own
part
i
find
that
i
can
meet
the
crisis
of
a
train
of
ideas
best
upon
my
feet
so
i
pace
up
and
down
past
the
old
black
dresser
with
its
gleaming
crockery
like
a
captain
on
his
suddenly
eleanor
chair
stands
still
margery
she
says
laying
her
head
upon
the
table
at
her
side
i
do
think
this
is
a
capital
idea
yours
will
be
capital
i
reply
pausing
also
and
leaning
back
against
the
dresser
for
you
have
kept
your
old
diaries
and
my
dear
margery
what
if
i
have
kept
my
old
diaries
i
lived
in
this
place
my
whole
life
now
you
have
had
some
adventures
i
quite
look
forward
to
reading
your
life
margery
you
have
no
idea
what
pleasure
it
gives
me
to
think
of
it
i
was
thinking
just
now
if
ever
we
are
separated
in
life
how
i
shall
enjoy
looking
over
it
again
and
again
you
must
give
me
yours
you
know
and
i
will
give
you
mine
yes
i
am
very
glad
we
thought
of
it
and
eleanor
begins
to
rock
once
more
and
i
resume
my
march
but
this
quite
settles
the
matter
in
my
mind
to
please
eleanor
i
would
try
to
do
a
great
deal
much
more
than
this
i
will
write
my
autobiography
though
it
seems
rather
to
use
an
expressive
quaker
term
a
to
provide
for
our
being
separated
in
life
when
we
have
so
firmly
resolved
to
be
old
maids
and
to
live
together
all
our
lives
in
the
little
whitewashed
cottage
behind
the
church
chapter
i
my
pretty
mother
ayah
company
my
name
is
margaret
vandaleur
my
father
was
a
captain
in
her
regiment
of
foot
the
regiment
was
in
india
for
six
years
just
after
i
was
born
indeed
i
was
not
many
months
old
when
i
made
my
first
voyage
which
i
fancy
eleanor
is
thinking
of
when
she
says
that
i
have
had
some
adventures
military
ladies
are
said
to
be
unlucky
as
to
the
times
when
they
have
to
change
stations
the
move
often
chancing
at
an
inconvenient
moment
my
mother
had
to
make
her
first
voyage
with
the
cares
of
a
young
baby
on
her
hands
nominally
at
any
rate
but
i
think
the
chief
care
of
me
fell
upon
our
ayah
my
mother
hired
her
in
england
the
ayah
wished
to
return
to
her
country
and
was
glad
to
do
so
as
my
nurse
i
think
that
at
first
she
only
intended
to
be
with
us
for
the
voyage
but
she
stayed
on
and
became
fond
of
me
and
so
remained
my
nurse
as
long
as
i
was
in
india
i
have
heard
that
my
mother
was
the
prettiest
woman
on
board
the
vessel
she
went
out
in
and
the
prettiest
woman
at
the
station
when
she
got
there
some
people
have
told
me
that
she
was
the
prettiest
woman
they
ever
saw
she
was
just
eighteen
years
old
when
my
father
married
her
and
she
was
not
when
she
died
i
got
so
far
in
writing
my
life
seated
at
the
round
pinewood
table
with
eleanor
scribbling
away
opposite
to
me
but
i
could
get
no
further
just
then
i
put
my
hands
before
my
eyes
as
if
to
shade
them
from
the
light
but
eleanor
is
very
quick
and
she
found
out
that
i
was
crying
she
jumped
up
and
threw
herself
at
my
feet
margery
dear
margery
what
the
matter
i
could
only
sob
my
mother
o
my
mother
and
add
almost
bitterly
it
is
very
well
for
you
to
write
about
your
childhood
who
have
had
a
mother
and
such
a
mother
all
your
life
but
for
me
eleanor
knelt
straight
up
with
her
teeth
set
and
her
hands
clasped
before
her
i
do
think
she
said
slowly
that
i
am
without
exception
the
most
selfish
inconsiderate
dense
unfeeling
brute
that
ever
lived
she
looked
so
quaintly
vehemently
in
earnest
as
she
knelt
in
the
firelight
that
i
laughed
in
spite
of
my
tears
my
dear
old
thing
i
said
it
is
i
who
am
selfish
not
you
but
i
am
going
on
now
and
i
promise
to
disturb
you
no
more
and
in
this
i
was
resolute
though
eleanor
would
have
burned
our
papers
then
and
there
if
i
had
not
prevented
her
indeed
she
knew
as
well
as
i
did
that
it
was
not
merely
because
i
was
an
orphan
that
i
wept
as
i
thought
of
my
early
childhood
we
could
not
speak
of
it
but
she
knew
enough
to
guess
at
what
was
passing
through
my
mind
i
was
only
six
years
old
when
my
mother
died
but
i
can
remember
her
i
can
remember
her
brief
appearances
in
the
room
where
i
played
in
much
dirt
and
contentment
at
my
ayah
feet
rustling
in
silks
and
satins
glittering
with
costly
ornaments
beautiful
and
scented
like
a
fairy
dream
i
would
forego
all
these
visions
for
one
only
one
memory
of
her
praying
by
my
bedside
or
teaching
me
at
her
knee
but
she
was
so
young
and
so
pretty
and
yet
o
mother
mother
better
than
all
the
triumphs
of
your
loveliness
in
its
too
short
prime
would
it
have
been
to
have
left
a
memory
of
your
beautiful
face
with
some
devout
or
earnest
look
upon
it
as
it
had
been
the
face
of
an
angel
to
your
only
child
as
i
sit
thinking
thus
i
find
eleanor
dark
eyes
gazing
at
me
from
her
place
to
which
she
has
gone
back
and
she
says
softly
margery
dear
margery
do
let
us
give
it
up
but
i
would
not
give
it
up
now
for
anything
whatever
the
first
six
years
of
my
life
were
spent
chiefly
with
my
ayah
i
loved
her
very
dearly
i
kissed
and
fondled
her
dark
cheeks
as
gladly
as
if
they
had
been
fair
and
ruddy
and
oftener
than
i
touched
my
mother
which
were
like
the
petals
of
a
china
rose
my
most
intimate
friends
were
of
the
ayah
complexion
we
had
more
than
one
bearer
during
those
years
to
whom
i
was
greatly
attached
i
spoke
more
hindostanee
than
english
the
other
day
i
saw
a
group
of
lascar
sailors
at
the
southampton
station
they
had
just
come
off
a
ship
and
were
talking
rapidly
and
softly
together
i
have
forgotten
the
language
of
my
early
childhood
but
its
tones
had
a
familiar
sound
those
dark
bright
faces
were
like
the
faces
of
old
friends
and
my
heart
beat
for
a
minute
as
one
is
moved
by
some
remembrance
of
an
old
home
when
my
mother
went
out
for
her
early
ride
at
daybreak
before
the
heat
of
the
day
came
on
ayah
would
hold
me
up
at
the
window
to
see
her
start
sometimes
my
father
would
have
me
brought
out
and
take
me
before
him
on
his
horse
for
a
few
minutes
but
my
nurse
never
allowed
this
if
a
ready
excuse
could
prevent
it
her
care
of
me
was
maternal
in
its
tenderness
but
she
did
not
keep
me
tidy
enough
for
me
to
be
presentable
to
company
there
was
always
company
wherever
my
mother
went
gentleman
company
especially
the
gentlemen
in
different
places
and
at
different
times
were
not
the
same
but
they
had
a
common
likeness
i
used
to
count
them
when
they
rode
home
with
my
father
and
mother
or
assembled
for
any
of
the
many
reasons
for
which
company
hung
about
our
homes
i
remember
that
it
was
an
amusement
to
me
to
discover
there
are
six
or
five
and
to
tell
my
ayah
i
was
even
more
minute
i
divided
them
into
three
classes
the
little
ones
the
middle
ones
and
the
old
ones
the
little
ones
were
the
very
young
men
ensigns
etc
the
old
ones
were
usually
colonels
generals
or
elderly
civilians
from
the
youngest
to
the
oldest
officers
and
civilians
they
were
all
very
to
me
and
i
approved
of
them
accordingly
when
callers
came
i
was
often
sent
into
the
great
was
my
dear
ayah
pride
when
i
was
dressed
in
pink
silk
my
hair
being
arranged
in
ringlets
round
my
head
to
be
shown
off
to
the
company
i
was
proud
of
myself
and
was
wont
rather
to
strut
than
walk
into
the
room
upon
my
best
kid
shoes
they
were
pink
to
match
my
frock
and
i
was
not
a
little
vain
of
them
there
were
usually
some
ladies
in
the
room
dressed
in
rustling
finery
like
my
mother
but
not
like
her
in
the
face
never
so
pretty
there
were
always
plenty
of
gentlemen
of
the
three
degrees
and
they
used
to
be
very
polite
to
me
and
to
call
me
little
rosebud
and
give
me
sweetmeats
i
liked
sweetmeats
and
i
liked
flattery
but
i
had
an
affection
stronger
than
my
fancy
for
either
i
used
to
look
sharply
over
the
assembled
men
for
the
face
i
wanted
and
when
i
had
found
it
i
flew
to
the
arms
that
were
stretched
out
for
me
they
were
my
father
i
remember
my
mother
but
i
remember
my
father
better
still
i
did
not
see
very
much
of
him
but
when
we
were
together
i
think
we
were
both
thoroughly
happy
i
can
recall
pretty
clearly
one
very
happy
holiday
we
spent
together
my
father
got
some
leave
and
took
us
for
a
short
time
to
the
hills
my
clearest
memory
of
his
face
is
as
it
smiled
on
me
from
under
a
broad
hat
as
we
made
nosegays
for
mamma
vases
in
our
beautiful
garden
where
the
fuchsias
and
geraniums
were
hardy
and
the
verbenas
and
heliotropes
were
great
bushes
loading
the
air
with
perfume
i
have
one
remembrance
of
it
almost
as
distinct
the
last
chapter
ii
the
cholera
season
my
mother
goes
away
my
sixth
birthday
we
were
living
in
a
bungalow
not
far
from
the
barracks
at
when
the
cholera
came
it
was
when
i
was
within
a
few
weeks
of
six
years
old
first
we
heard
that
it
was
among
the
natives
and
the
matter
did
not
excite
much
notice
then
it
broke
out
among
the
men
and
the
officers
talked
a
good
deal
about
it
the
next
news
was
of
the
death
of
the
colonel
commanding
our
regiment
one
of
my
early
recollections
is
of
our
hearing
of
this
an
ensign
of
our
regiment
one
of
the
little
ones
called
upon
my
mother
in
the
evening
of
the
day
of
the
colonel
death
he
was
very
white
very
nervous
very
restless
he
brought
us
the
news
the
colonel
had
been
ill
barely
hours
he
had
suffered
agonies
with
wonderful
firmness
he
was
to
be
buried
the
next
day
he
never
was
afraid
of
cholera
said
gordon
he
did
believe
it
was
infectious
he
thought
keeping
up
the
men
spirits
was
everything
but
you
see
it
is
nervousness
after
all
that
does
it
it
goes
a
long
way
gordon
said
my
father
you
young
never
been
through
one
of
these
seasons
do
get
fanciful
my
good
fellow
come
here
and
play
with
margery
gordon
laughed
i
am
a
fool
certainly
he
said
ever
since
i
heard
of
it
i
have
fancied
a
strange
faint
kind
of
smell
everywhere
which
is
absurd
enough
i
will
make
you
a
said
my
mother
that
ought
to
overpower
any
faint
smell
and
it
is
a
charm
against
infection
i
believe
gordon
was
beginning
to
thank
her
but
his
words
ended
in
a
sort
of
inarticulate
groan
he
stood
on
his
feet
though
not
upright
and
at
last
said
feebly
i
beg
your
pardon
i
do
feel
quite
well
you
upset
old
fellow
it
quite
natural
said
my
father
come
and
get
some
brandy
and
you
shall
come
back
for
the
camphor
my
father
led
him
away
but
he
did
not
come
back
my
father
took
him
to
his
quarters
and
sent
the
surgeon
to
him
and
my
mother
took
me
on
her
knee
and
sat
silent
for
a
long
time
with
the
unfinished
beside
her
the
next
day
i
went
to
the
end
of
our
compound
with
ayah
to
see
the
colonel
funeral
pass
the
procession
seemed
endless
the
horse
he
had
ridden
two
days
before
by
my
mother
side
tossed
its
head
fretfully
as
the
dead
march
wailed
and
the
slow
tramp
of
feet
poured
endlessly
on
my
mother
was
looking
out
from
the
verandah
as
ayah
and
i
joined
her
a
native
servant
who
was
bringing
something
in
said
abruptly
gordon
sahib
he
dead
too
when
my
father
returned
from
the
funeral
he
found
my
mother
in
a
panic
some
friends
had
lately
invited
her
to
stay
with
them
and
she
was
now
resolved
to
go
i
am
sure
i
shall
die
if
i
stay
here
she
cried
and
it
ended
in
her
going
away
at
once
there
was
some
difficulty
as
to
accommodating
me
and
ayah
and
it
was
decided
that
if
necessary
we
should
follow
my
mother
later
for
my
own
part
i
begged
to
remain
i
had
no
fear
of
cholera
and
i
was
anxious
to
dine
with
my
father
on
my
birthday
as
he
had
promised
that
i
should
it
was
on
the
day
before
my
birthday
that
one
of
the
surgeons
was
buried
the
man
next
in
rank
to
the
poor
colonel
was
on
leave
and
the
regiment
was
commanded
by
our
friend
major
buller
whose
little
daughters
were
invited
to
spend
the
following
evening
with
me
the
major
my
father
and
two
other
officers
had
been
at
the
funeral
my
father
came
to
me
on
his
return
he
was
slightly
chilled
and
said
he
should
remain
indoors
so
i
had
him
all
to
myself
and
we
were
very
happy
though
he
complained
of
fatigue
and
fell
asleep
once
on
the
floor
with
his
head
in
my
lap
he
was
still
lying
on
the
floor
when
ayah
took
me
to
bed
i
believe
he
had
been
unwell
all
the
day
though
i
did
not
know
it
and
had
been
taking
some
of
the
many
specifics
against
cholera
of
which
everybody
had
one
or
more
at
that
time
later
he
sent
for
a
surgeon
who
happened
to
be
dining
with
major
buller
the
doctor
and
the
major
came
together
to
our
bungalow
and
with
them
two
other
officers
who
happened
to
be
of
the
party
and
who
were
friends
of
my
father
one
of
them
was
a
particular
friend
of
my
own
he
was
an
ensign
a
reckless
lad
in
his
teens
a
abercrombie
who
had
good
reason
to
count
my
father
as
a
friend
abercrombie
mingled
in
some
way
with
my
dreams
that
night
or
rather
early
morning
and
when
i
fairly
woke
it
was
to
the
end
of
a
discussion
betwixt
my
ayah
who
was
crying
and
abercrombie
in
evening
dress
whose
face
bore
traces
of
what
looked
to
me
like
crying
also
i
was
hastily
clothed
and
he
took
me
in
his
arms
papa
wants
you
margery
dear
he
said
and
he
carried
me
quickly
down
the
passages
in
the
dim
light
of
the
early
summer
dawn
two
or
three
officers
amongst
whom
i
recognized
major
buller
fell
back
as
we
came
in
from
the
bed
to
which
abercrombie
carried
me
my
father
turned
his
face
eagerly
towards
me
but
i
shrank
away
that
one
night
of
suffering
and
collapse
had
changed
him
so
that
i
did
not
know
him
again
at
last
i
was
persuaded
to
go
to
him
and
by
his
voice
and
manner
recognized
him
as
his
feeble
fingers
played
tenderly
with
mine
and
when
he
said
kiss
me
margery
dear
i
crept
up
and
kissed
his
forehead
and
started
to
feel
it
so
cold
and
damp
be
a
good
girl
margery
dear
he
whispered
be
very
good
to
mamma
there
was
a
short
silence
then
he
said
is
the
sun
rising
yet
buller
just
rising
old
fellow
does
the
light
bother
you
no
thank
you
i
ca
see
it
the
fact
is
i
ca
see
you
now
i
suppose
it
nearly
over
god
will
be
done
you
got
the
papers
buller
arkwright
will
be
kind
about
it
i
sure
you
break
it
to
my
wife
as
well
as
you
can
after
another
pause
he
said
it
time
you
fellows
went
to
bed
and
got
some
sleep
but
no
one
moved
and
there
was
another
silence
which
my
father
broke
by
saying
buller
where
are
you
it
quite
dark
now
would
you
say
the
lord
prayer
for
me
old
fellow
margery
dear
put
your
hands
with
poor
papa
i
not
said
my
prayers
yet
said
i
and
you
know
i
ought
to
say
my
prayers
for
i
been
dressed
a
long
time
the
major
knelt
simply
by
the
bed
the
other
men
standing
bent
their
heads
and
abercrombie
kneeling
buried
his
face
on
the
end
of
the
bed
and
sobbed
aloud
major
buller
said
the
lord
prayer
i
believing
it
to
be
my
duty
said
it
also
and
my
father
said
it
with
us
to
the
clause
for
thine
is
the
kingdom
the
power
and
the
glory
when
his
voice
failed
and
i
thinking
he
had
forgotten
for
i
sometimes
forgot
in
the
middle
of
my
most
familiar
prayers
and
hymns
helped
him
papa
dear
ever
and
still
he
was
silent
and
as
i
bent
over
him
i
heard
one
breath
and
then
his
hands
which
were
enfolded
with
mine
fell
apart
the
sunshine
was
now
beginning
to
catch
objects
in
the
room
and
a
ray
lighted
up
my
father
face
and
showed
a
change
that
even
i
could
see
an
officer
standing
at
the
head
of
the
bed
saw
it
also
and
said
abruptly
he
dead
buller
and
the
major
starting
up
took
me
in
his
arms
and
carried
me
away
i
cried
and
struggled
i
had
a
dim
sense
of
what
had
happened
mixed
with
an
idea
that
these
men
were
separating
me
from
my
father
i
could
not
be
pacified
till
abercrombie
held
out
his
arms
for
me
he
was
more
like
a
woman
and
he
was
crying
as
well
as
i
went
to
him
and
buried
my
sobs
on
his
shoulder
george
as
i
had
long
called
him
from
finding
his
surname
hard
to
utter
carried
me
into
the
passage
and
walked
up
and
down
comforting
me
is
papa
really
dead
i
at
length
found
voice
to
ask
yes
margery
dear
i
so
sorry
will
he
go
to
abraham
bosom
mr
george
will
he
go
margery
to
abraham
bosom
you
know
where
the
poor
beggar
went
that
lying
on
the
steps
in
my
sunday
playing
with
those
dear
old
dogs
abercrombie
knowledge
of
holy
scripture
was
i
fear
limited
possibly
my
remarks
recalled
some
childish
remembrance
similar
to
my
own
he
said
oh
yes
to
be
sure
yes
dear
do
you
think
the
dogs
went
with
the
poor
beggar
i
asked
do
you
think
the
angels
took
them
too
i
do
know
said
george
i
hope
they
did
there
was
a
pause
and
then
i
asked
in
tones
will
the
angels
fetch
papa
do
you
think
george
had
evidently
decided
to
follow
my
theological
lead
and
he
replied
yes
margery
dear
shall
you
see
them
i
asked
no
no
margery
i
not
good
enough
to
see
angels
think
you
very
good
said
i
and
please
be
good
george
and
then
the
angels
will
fetch
you
and
perhaps
me
and
mamma
and
perhaps
ayah
and
perhaps
bustle
and
perhaps
clive
bustle
was
abercrombie
dog
and
clive
was
a
mastiff
the
dog
of
the
regiment
and
a
personal
friend
of
mine
very
well
margery
dear
and
now
you
must
be
good
too
and
you
must
let
me
take
you
to
bed
for
it
morning
now
and
i
have
had
no
sleep
at
all
is
it
now
i
asked
because
if
it
it
my
birthday
and
i
began
to
cry
afresh
because
papa
had
promised
that
i
should
dine
with
him
and
had
promised
me
a
present
also
i
give
you
a
birthday
present
said
my
friend
and
he
began
to
unfasten
a
locket
that
hung
at
his
it
was
of
indian
gold
with
in
turquoise
stones
upon
it
he
opened
it
and
pulled
out
a
photograph
which
he
tore
to
bits
and
then
trampled
underfoot
there
margery
there
a
locket
for
you
you
can
throw
it
into
the
fire
or
do
anything
you
like
with
it
and
i
wish
you
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
and
he
finally
fastened
it
round
my
neck
with
his
trichinopoli
leaving
his
watch
loose
in
his
the
locket
and
chain
pleased
me
and
i
suffered
him
to
carry
me
to
bed
then
as
he
was
parting
from
me
i
thought
of
my
father
again
and
asked
do
you
think
the
angels
have
fetched
papa
mr
george
i
think
they
have
margery
whereupon
i
cried
myself
to
sleep
and
this
was
my
sixth
birthday
chapter
iii
the
bullers
matilda
takes
me
up
we
fall
out
george
major
buller
took
me
home
to
his
house
after
my
father
death
my
father
had
left
his
affairs
in
his
hands
and
in
those
of
a
friend
in
england
the
arkwright
he
had
spoken
of
i
believe
they
were
both
trustees
under
my
mother
marriage
settlement
the
bullers
were
relations
of
mine
buller
was
my
mother
cousin
she
was
a
talkative
lady
and
though
no
longer
very
young
she
dressed
as
gaily
as
my
poor
mother
though
somehow
not
with
quite
so
good
an
effect
she
copied
my
mother
style
and
sometimes
wore
things
exactly
similar
to
hers
but
the
result
was
not
the
same
i
have
heard
minchin
say
that
my
mother
took
a
malicious
pleasure
at
times
in
wearing
costumes
that
would
have
been
most
trying
to
beauty
less
radiant
and
youthful
than
hers
for
the
fun
of
seeing
poor
theresa
appear
in
a
similar
garb
with
less
success
but
minchin
tales
had
always
a
sting
in
them
buller
received
me
very
kindly
she
kissed
me
and
told
me
to
call
her
aunt
theresa
which
i
did
ever
afterwards
aunt
daughters
and
i
were
like
sisters
they
showed
me
their
best
frocks
and
told
me
exactly
all
that
had
been
ordered
in
the
parcel
that
was
coming
out
from
england
do
you
have
your
hair
put
in
papers
said
matilda
whose
own
curls
sat
stiffly
round
her
head
as
regularly
as
the
rolls
of
a
lawyer
wig
are
your
socks
like
lace
does
your
ayah
dress
you
every
afternoon
matilda
took
me
up
she
was
four
years
older
than
i
was
which
entitled
her
to
blend
patronage
with
her
affection
for
me
in
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
i
went
to
the
bullers
she
took
me
by
the
hand
and
tossing
her
curls
said
i
have
taken
you
up
margery
vandaleur
minchin
told
mamma
that
she
has
taken
the
bride
up
i
heard
her
say
that
the
bride
was
a
sweet
little
puss
only
so
childish
that
just
what
minchin
said
i
heard
her
and
i
shall
say
so
of
you
too
as
i
taken
you
up
you
a
sweet
little
puss
and
of
course
you
childish
because
you
a
child
adds
miss
matilda
with
an
air
for
had
not
she
begun
to
write
her
own
age
with
two
figures
had
i
known
then
as
much
as
i
learned
afterwards
of
what
it
meant
to
be
taken
up
by
minchin
i
might
not
have
thought
the
comparison
a
good
omen
for
my
friendship
with
matilda
to
be
hotly
taken
up
by
minchin
meant
an
equally
hot
quarrel
at
no
very
distant
date
the
squabble
with
the
bride
was
not
slow
to
come
but
matilda
and
i
fell
out
first
i
think
she
was
tyrannical
and
i
know
i
was
peevish
my
ayah
spoilt
me
i
spoke
very
broken
english
and
by
no
means
understood
all
that
the
bullers
said
to
me
besides
which
i
was
feverishly
unhappy
at
intervals
about
my
father
it
was
two
months
before
minchin
found
out
that
her
sweet
little
puss
was
a
deceitful
little
cat
but
at
the
end
of
two
days
i
had
offended
matilda
and
we
plunged
into
a
war
of
words
such
as
children
wage
when
they
squabble
i
wo
show
you
any
more
of
my
dresses
said
matilda
i
seen
them
all
i
boldly
asserted
and
the
stroke
told
you
do
know
that
said
matilda
yes
i
do
no
you
do
well
show
me
the
others
then
no
that
i
wo
i
do
care
i
got
a
blue
silk
coming
out
from
england
matilda
continued
but
you
have
i
got
a
pink
silk
here
said
i
and
pink
shoes
ah
but
you
ca
wear
them
now
your
papa
dead
said
matilda
mamma
says
you
will
have
to
wear
black
for
twelve
months
i
am
sure
matilda
did
not
mean
to
be
cruel
but
this
blow
cut
me
deeply
i
remember
the
tide
of
misery
that
seemed
to
flood
over
my
mind
to
this
day
i
was
miserable
because
my
father
was
dead
and
i
could
not
go
to
him
for
comfort
i
was
miserable
because
i
was
out
of
temper
and
matilda
had
had
the
best
of
the
quarrel
i
was
miserable
poor
little
wretch
because
i
could
not
wear
my
pink
silk
now
my
father
was
dead
i
put
my
hands
to
my
eyes
and
screaming
papa
papa
i
rushed
out
into
the
verandah
as
i
ran
out
some
one
ran
in
we
struck
against
each
other
and
bustle
and
i
rolled
over
on
to
the
floor
in
a
moment
more
i
was
in
abercrombie
arms
and
sobbing
out
my
woes
to
him
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
he
swore
rather
loudly
when
he
heard
what
matilda
had
said
and
i
fancy
that
he
lectured
her
when
i
had
gone
to
ayah
for
she
came
to
me
presently
and
begged
my
pardon
of
course
we
were
at
once
as
friendly
as
before
many
another
breach
was
there
between
us
after
that
hastily
made
and
quickly
healed
but
the
bride
and
minchin
never
came
to
terms
george
remained
my
devoted
friend
i
looked
for
him
as
i
used
to
look
for
my
father
the
first
time
i
saw
him
after
i
came
to
the
bullers
was
on
the
day
of
my
father
funeral
he
was
there
and
came
back
with
major
buller
i
was
on
george
knee
in
a
moment
with
my
hand
through
the
crape
upon
his
sleeve
the
major
slowly
unfastened
his
and
laid
it
down
with
a
sigh
saying
we
lost
a
good
man
abercrombie
and
a
true
friend
you
do
know
what
a
friend
to
me
said
george
impetuously
why
look
here
sir
a
month
or
two
ago
i
outrun
the
constable
i
always
am
getting
into
a
mess
of
some
sort
and
vandaleur
found
it
out
and
lent
me
the
money
you
not
the
first
youngster
he
has
helped
by
many
to
my
knowledge
said
major
buller
but
that
not
all
sir
said
george
standing
up
with
me
in
his
arms
when
we
first
went
in
that
night
you
remember
his
speaking
privately
to
me
once
well
what
he
said
was
think
i
following
the
rest
abercrombie
and
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
this
he
had
got
my
in
his
hand
and
he
tore
it
across
and
said
bother
any
more
about
it
but
keep
straight
my
boy
if
you
can
for
your
people
sake
i
sadly
given
to
going
crooked
sir
but
if
anything
could
make
a
fellow
george
got
no
further
in
his
sentence
but
the
major
seemed
to
understand
what
he
meant
for
he
spoke
very
kindly
to
him
and
they
left
me
for
a
bit
and
walked
up
and
down
the
verandah
together
just
before
george
left
i
heard
him
say
have
you
heard
anything
of
mrs
vandaleur
i
wrote
to
her
in
the
best
fashion
that
i
could
said
major
buller
but
there
no
breaking
rough
news
gently
abercrombie
i
ought
to
hear
from
her
soon
but
he
never
did
hear
from
her
my
poor
mother
had
fled
from
the
cholera
only
to
fall
a
victim
to
fever
the
news
of
my
father
death
was
i
believe
the
immediate
cause
of
the
relapse
in
which
she
died
and
so
i
became
an
orphan
shortly
afterwards
the
regiment
was
ordered
home
and
the
bullers
took
me
with
them

minchin
is
reconciled
the
voyage
home
a
death
on
board
i
only
remember
a
little
of
our
voyage
home
in
the
but
i
have
heard
so
much
of
it
from
the
elder
buller
girls
and
the
ladies
of
the
regiment
that
i
seem
quite
familiar
with
all
that
happened
and
i
hardly
know
now
what
i
remember
myself
and
what
has
been
recalled
or
suggested
to
me
by
hearing
the
other
ladies
talk
there
was
no
lack
of
subjects
for
talk
when
the
news
came
that
the
regiment
was
ordered
home
as
aunt
theresa
repeatedly
remarked
there
are
a
great
many
things
to
be
considered
and
she
considered
them
all
day
long
by
word
of
mouth
the
colonel
that
is
the
new
colonel
he
had
just
returned
from
leave
in
the
hills
and
his
wife
behaved
rather
shabbily
it
was
thought
but
as
minchin
said
what
could
you
expect
they
say
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
wholesale
draper
in
the
city
and
trade
in
the
blood
always
peeps
out
we
knew
for
certain
that
before
there
was
a
word
said
about
the
regiment
going
home
it
had
been
settled
that
the
wife
should
go
to
england
where
her
daughters
were
being
educated
and
take
the
two
youngest
children
with
her
her
passage
in
the
was
all
but
taken
if
not
quite
and
then
when
they
heard
of
the
she
stayed
to
go
home
in
that
money
can
be
no
object
to
them
said
minchin
for
one
of
the
city
people
belonging
to
her
has
died
lately
and
left
her
i
ca
tell
you
how
many
thousands
indeed
they
heaps
of
money
and
now
he
got
the
regiment
he
ought
to
retire
and
i
must
say
i
think
it
very
hard
on
you
dear
buller
with
all
your
family
senior
officer
wife
accommodation
would
be
little
enough
for
a
long
voyage
which
is
no
reason
why
my
wife
should
have
better
accommodation
than
she
is
entitled
to
more
than
any
other
lady
on
board
observed
uncle
buller
the
quartermaster
wife
has
more
children
than
we
have
and
you
know
how
much
room
she
will
get
quartermaster
wife
muttered
minchin
she
would
have
been
accommodated
with
the
women
of
the
regiment
if
we
had
gone
home
three
months
ago
at
which
time
quartermaster
curling
was
still
only
a
sergeant
uncle
buller
made
no
reply
he
was
not
fond
of
minchin
and
he
never
disputed
a
point
with
her
one
topic
of
the
day
was
sales
we
all
had
to
sell
off
what
we
did
not
want
to
take
home
and
the
point
was
to
choose
the
right
moment
for
doing
so
i
sha
be
the
first
said
aunt
theresa
decidedly
the
first
sales
are
always
failures
somehow
people
are
depressed
then
they
know
that
there
are
plenty
more
to
come
and
they
hang
back
but
further
on
people
have
just
got
into
an
extravagant
humour
and
would
go
to
fifty
sales
a
day
later
still
they
find
out
that
they
got
all
they
want
and
a
great
deal
that
they
do
want
put
in
uncle
buller
which
is
all
the
same
thing
said
aunt
theresa
so
i
shall
sell
about
the
middle
which
she
did
demanding
her
friends
condolences
beforehand
on
the
way
in
which
her
goods
and
chattels
would
be
given
away
and
receiving
their
congratulations
afterwards
upon
the
high
prices
that
they
fetched
to
do
aunt
theresa
justice
if
she
was
managing
she
was
quite
honest
eleanor
is
shocked
by
some
of
the
things
i
say
about
people
in
our
own
rank
of
life
she
believes
that
certain
vulgar
vices
such
as
cheating
lying
gluttony
petty
gossip
malicious
are
confined
to
the
lower
orders
or
as
she
wisely
and
kindly
phrases
it
to
people
who
know
no
better
she
laughs
at
me
and
i
laugh
at
myself
when
i
say
to
support
my
own
views
that
i
know
more
of
the
world
than
she
does
since
what
i
know
of
the
world
beyond
this
happy
corner
of
it
i
learned
when
i
was
a
mere
child
but
though
we
laugh
i
can
remember
a
good
deal
i
have
heard
polished
gentlemen
lie
at
a
pinch
like
the
proverbial
and
pretty
ladies
fib
as
well
as
of
course
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
as
many
ladies
as
tell
untruths
but
eleanor
would
fain
believe
that
the
lie
which
solomon
discovered
to
be
continually
on
the
lips
of
the
untaught
is
not
on
the
lips
of
those
who
know
better
at
all
as
to
dishonesty
too
i
should
be
sorry
to
say
that
customers
cheat
as
much
as
shopkeepers
but
i
do
think
that
many
people
who
ought
to
know
better
seem
to
forget
that
their
honour
as
well
as
their
interest
is
concerned
in
every
bargain
the
question
then
arises
do
people
in
our
rank
know
so
much
better
on
these
points
of
moral
conduct
than
those
below
them
if
eleanor
and
her
parents
are
and
the
boys
think
us
quite
behind
the
times
i
fancy
that
perhaps
high
principle
and
a
nice
sense
of
honour
are
not
so
well
taught
now
as
they
used
to
be
noble
sentiments
are
not
the
fashion
the
very
phrase
provokes
a
smile
of
ridicule
but
i
do
not
know
whether
the
habit
of
uttering
ignoble
ones
in
chaff
does
not
at
last
bring
the
tone
of
mind
down
to
the
low
level
it
is
so
terribly
easy
to
be
mean
and
covetous
and
selfish
and
cowardly
untrue
if
the
people
by
whose
good
opinion
one
character
lives
will
comfortably
confess
that
they
also
look
out
for
themselves
and
take
care
of
number
one
and
think
money
the
great
thing
in
this
world
and
hold
the
social
lie
to
be
a
necessary
part
of
social
intercourse
i
know
that
once
or
twice
it
has
happened
that
young
people
with
whom
we
have
been
thrown
have
said
things
which
have
made
eleanor
stand
aghast
in
honourable
horror
and
that
that
speechless
indignation
of
hers
has
been
as
much
lost
upon
them
as
the
touch
of
a
feather
on
the
hide
of
a
rhinoceros
eleanor
is
more
impatient
than
i
am
on
such
subjects
i
who
have
been
trained
in
more
than
one
school
myself
am
sorry
for
those
who
have
never
known
the
higher
teaching
eleanor
thinks
that
modesty
delicacy
of
mind
and
taste
and
uprightness
in
word
and
deed
are
innate
in
worthy
characters
where
she
finds
them
absent
she
is
apt
to
dilate
her
nostrils
and
say
in
that
low
emphatic
voice
which
is
her
excited
tone
there
are
some
things
that
you
can
not
anybody
and
so
turn
her
back
for
ever
on
the
offender
or
as
she
once
said
to
a
friend
of
the
boys
who
was
staying
with
us
in
the
heat
of
argument
i
supposed
that
honourable
men
like
poets
are
born
not
made
i
indeed
do
believe
these
qualities
to
be
in
great
measure
inherited
but
i
believe
them
also
to
come
of
training
and
to
be
more
easily
lost
than
eleanor
will
allow
she
has
only
lived
in
one
moral
atmosphere
i
think
that
the
standard
of
a
family
or
a
social
circle
falls
but
too
easily
and
in
all
humbleness
of
mind
i
say
that
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
in
this
respect
as
in
other
matters
elevation
and
amendment
are
possible
however
this
is
one
of
the
many
subjects
we
discuss
rocking
and
pacing
the
kitchen
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
we
have
confessed
that
our
experience
is
very
small
and
our
opinions
still
unfixed
in
the
matter
so
it
is
unlikely
that
i
shall
settle
it
to
my
own
or
satisfaction
in
the
pages
of
this
biography
to
return
to
aunt
theresa
she
was
as
i
said
honest
she
chose
a
good
moment
for
our
sale
but
she
did
not
doctor
the
things
for
the
credit
of
the
regiment
i
feel
ashamed
to
confess
that
everybody
was
not
so
scrupulous
one
lady
sat
in
our
with
worth
of
lace
upon
her
dress
and
congratulated
herself
on
having
sold
some
as
sound
of
which
she
had
daintily
doctored
two
fractures
with
an
invaluable
cement
the
pecuniary
gain
may
have
been
the
loss
in
she
did
not
seem
to
estimate
aunt
theresa
would
not
have
done
it
herself
but
she
laughed
encouragingly
it
is
difficult
to
be
with
a
lady
who
had
so
much
old
point
and
whose
silks
are
so
stiff
that
she
can
rustle
down
your
remonstrances
another
friend
a
young
officer
whose
personal
extravagance
was
a
proverb
even
at
a
station
in
india
boasted
for
a
week
of
having
sold
a
rickety
shelf
to
a
man
who
was
going
off
to
the
hills
for
rupees
when
it
was
not
worth
six
i
have
heard
him
swear
at
tailors
servants
and
subordinates
of
all
kinds
for
cheating
i
do
not
think
it
ever
dawned
upon
his
mind
that
common
honesty
was
a
virtue
in
which
he
himself
was
wanting
as
to
minchin
tales
on
this
subject
but
minchin
tales
were
not
to
be
relied
upon
it
was
about
this
time
that
minchin
and
the
bride
quarrelled
in
a
few
weeks
after
her
arrival
the
bride
knew
all
the
ladies
of
the
regiment
and
the
society
of
the
station
and
then
showed
little
inclination
to
be
by
minchin
she
met
that
terrible
lady
so
smartly
on
one
occasion
that
she
retired
worsted
for
the
afternoon
and
the
bride
drove
triumphantly
round
the
place
and
called
on
all
her
friends
looking
as
soft
as
a
chinchilla
muff
and
dropping
at
every
bungalow
the
tale
of
something
that
minchin
had
said
by
no
means
to
the
advantage
of
the
inmates
it
was
in
this
way
that
aunt
theresa
came
to
know
what
minchin
had
said
about
her
wearing
for
my
father
and
mother
that
she
knew
better
than
to
go
into
deep
black
which
is
trying
to
indefinite
complexions
but
was
equal
to
any
length
of
grief
in
those
lavenders
and
delicate
combinations
of
black
and
white
which
are
so
becoming
to
everybody
especially
to
people
who
are
not
quite
so
young
as
they
have
been
in
the
warmth
of
her
own
indignation
at
these
unwarrantable
remarks
and
of
the
bride
ready
sympathy
aunt
theresa
felt
herself
in
candour
bound
to
reveal
what
minchin
had
told
her
about
the
bride
having
sold
a
lot
of
her
wedding
presents
at
the
sale
for
fancy
prices
they
being
ornaments
and
so
forth
not
yet
to
be
got
at
the
station
the
result
of
this
general
information
all
round
was
of
course
a
quarrel
between
minchin
and
nearly
every
lady
in
the
regiment
the
bride
had
not
failed
to
let
the
colonel
lady
know
what
minchin
thought
of
her
going
home
in
the
and
had
made
a
call
upon
the
quartermaster
wife
for
the
pleasure
of
making
her
acquainted
with
minchin
warm
wish
that
the
regiment
had
been
ordered
home
three
months
sooner
when
mrs
curling
and
the
too
numerous
little
curlings
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
intrude
upon
the
ladies
cabin
and
yet
strange
to
say
before
we
were
to
england
minchin
was
friendly
once
more
with
all
but
the
bride
and
the
bride
was
at
enmity
with
every
lady
on
board
the
truth
is
minchin
though
a
gossip
of
the
deepest
dye
was
after
a
fashion
her
restless
energy
which
chiefly
expended
itself
in
petty
social
plots
and
the
fomentation
of
quarrels
was
not
seldom
employed
also
in
practical
kindness
towards
those
who
happened
to
be
in
favour
with
her
she
was
really
interested
for
good
or
for
evil
in
those
with
whose
affairs
she
meddled
and
if
she
was
a
dangerous
enemy
and
a
yet
more
dangerous
friend
she
was
neither
selfish
nor
illiberal
the
bride
on
the
other
hand
had
no
real
interest
whatever
in
affairs
but
her
own
and
combined
in
the
highest
degree
those
qualities
of
personal
extravagance
and
general
meanness
which
not
unfrequently
go
together
a
long
voyage
is
no
small
test
of
temper
and
it
was
a
situation
in
which
minchin
best
qualities
shone
it
was
proportionably
unfavourable
to
those
of
the
bride
her
maid
was
sick
and
she
was
slovenly
she
was
sick
herself
and
then
her
selfishness
and
discontent
knew
no
check
the
other
ladies
bore
their
own
little
troubles
and
helped
each
other
but
under
the
peevish
egotism
of
the
bride
her
warmest
friends
revolted
it
was
then
that
minchin
resumed
her
sway
amongst
us
with
aunt
theresa
she
was
soon
reconciled
buller
memory
was
always
hazy
both
in
reference
to
what
she
said
herself
and
to
what
was
said
to
her
she
was
too
to
strain
it
to
recall
past
grievances
her
indignation
had
not
lasted
much
beyond
that
afternoon
in
which
the
bride
scattered
discord
among
her
acquaintances
she
had
relieved
herself
by
outpouring
the
tale
of
minchin
treachery
to
uncle
buller
and
then
taking
him
warmly
to
task
for
the
indifference
with
which
he
heard
her
wrongs
and
had
ended
by
laughing
heartily
when
he
compared
the
probable
encounter
between
minchin
and
the
bride
to
the
deadly
struggles
of
two
quarrelsome
in
his
collection
major
buller
was
a
naturalist
and
took
home
some
rare
and
beautiful
specimens
of
indian
insects
it
was
an
outbreak
of
sickness
amongst
the
little
curlings
which
led
to
the
reconciliation
with
the
quartermaster
wife
neither
her
kindness
of
heart
nor
her
love
of
managing
other
folks
matters
would
permit
minchin
to
be
passive
then
she
made
the
first
advances
and
poor
mrs
curling
gratefully
responded
i
sure
minchin
said
she
i
do
wonder
at
any
one
thinking
the
children
would
be
in
the
way
poor
dears
but
of
course
as
curling
said
god
bless
you
my
good
woman
minchin
broke
in
do
let
us
go
back
to
that
we
all
know
pretty
well
what
seymour
made
of
now
let
go
to
the
children
i
as
good
a
as
most
people
and
if
you
keep
up
your
heart
we
pull
them
all
through
before
we
get
to
the
cape
but
with
all
her
zeal
and
it
did
not
stop
short
of
a
quarrel
with
the
surgeon
and
all
her
devotion
which
never
slackened
minchin
did
not
pull
them
all
through
we
were
just
off
the
cape
when
arthur
curling
died
he
was
my
own
age
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
voyage
we
had
been
playfellows
of
all
the
children
who
swarmed
on
deck
to
the
distraction
of
at
least
the
unmarried
officers
of
the
regiment
he
had
been
the
noisiest
and
the
merriest
he
made
fancy
ships
in
corners
to
which
he
admitted
the
other
children
as
fancy
passengers
or
fancy
ship
officers
of
various
grades
once
he
employed
a
dozen
of
us
to
haul
at
a
rope
as
if
we
were
heaving
the
log
owing
to
an
unexpected
coil
it
slackened
suddenly
and
we
all
fell
over
one
another
at
the
feet
of
two
young
officers
who
were
marching
up
and
down
absorbed
in
conversation
their
anger
was
loud
as
well
as
deep
but
it
did
not
deter
arthur
curling
from
further
exploits
or
stop
his
ceaseless
chatter
about
what
he
would
do
when
he
was
a
man
and
the
captain
of
a
vessel
he
did
not
live
to
be
either
the
one
or
the
other
some
very
rough
weather
off
the
cape
was
fatal
to
him
at
a
critical
point
in
his
illness
how
minchin
contrived
to
keep
her
own
feet
and
to
nurse
the
poor
boy
as
she
did
was
a
marvel
he
died
on
her
knees
the
weather
had
been
rough
up
to
the
time
of
his
death
but
it
was
a
calm
lovely
morning
on
which
his
body
was
committed
to
the
deep
the
ship
bell
tolled
at
daybreak
and
all
the
ladies
but
the
bride
were
with
poor
mrs
curling
at
the
funeral
seymour
lay
in
her
berth
and
whined
complaints
of
that
horrid
bell
she
displayed
something
between
an
interesting
terror
and
a
shrewish
anger
because
there
was
a
body
on
board
when
she
said
that
the
curlings
ought
to
be
thankful
to
have
one
child
less
to
provide
for
the
other
ladies
hurried
indignantly
from
the
cabin
the
early
morning
air
was
fresh
and
mild
the
sea
and
sky
were
grey
but
peaceful
the
decks
were
freshly
washed
the
sailors
in
various
parts
of
the
ship
uncovered
their
heads
the
colonel
and
several
officers
were
present
i
had
earnestly
begged
to
be
there
also
and
finding
george
i
stood
with
my
hand
in
his
mrs
curling
grief
had
passed
the
point
of
tears
she
had
not
shed
one
since
the
boy
died
though
minchin
had
tried
hard
to
move
her
to
the
natural
relief
of
weeping
she
only
stood
in
silent
agony
though
the
quartermaster
cheeks
were
wet
and
most
of
the
ladies
sobbed
aloud
as
the
little
coffin
slid
over
the
hatchway
into
the
quiet
sea
the
sun
rose
and
a
long
level
beam
covered
the
place
where
the
body
had
gone
down
then
with
a
sudden
cry
the
mother
burst
into
tears
chapter
a
home
station
what
buller
thought
of
it
what
major
buller
thought
of
it
riflebury
in
the
south
of
england
our
next
station
was
a
very
lively
place
there
was
always
something
going
on
somebody
was
always
dropping
in
people
called
and
stayed
to
lunch
in
a
friendly
way
one
was
sure
of
some
one
at
afternoon
tea
what
with
croquet
and
archery
in
the
gardens
meeting
friends
on
the
esplanade
concerts
at
the
rooms
shopping
and
changing
one
novels
at
the
circulating
library
one
really
never
had
a
dull
hour
so
said
everybody
and
one
or
two
people
including
major
buller
added
that
one
never
had
an
hour
to
one
self
if
you
had
any
one
occupation
you
know
how
maddening
it
is
he
exclaimed
one
day
in
a
fit
of
desperation
any
one
occupation
cried
buller
to
whom
he
had
spoken
sure
edward
i
always
busy
i
never
have
a
quiet
moment
from
morning
to
night
it
seems
to
me
but
it
is
so
like
you
men
you
can
stick
to
one
thing
all
along
and
your
meals
come
to
you
as
if
they
dropped
out
of
the
skies
and
your
clothes
come
from
the
tailor
and
very
dearly
they
have
to
be
paid
for
too
and
when
one
is
ordering
dinner
and
luncheon
and
keeping
one
clothes
decent
and
looking
after
the
children
and
the
servants
and
taking
your
card
and
contriving
excuses
that
are
not
fibs
for
you
to
the
people
you
ought
to
call
on
from
week
end
to
week
end
you
say
one
has
no
occupation
well
well
my
dear
said
the
major
i
know
you
have
all
the
trouble
of
the
household
but
i
meant
to
say
that
if
you
had
any
pursuit
any
study
and
as
to
visitors
continued
aunt
theresa
who
always
pursued
her
own
train
of
ideas
irrespective
of
replies
i
sure
society
no
pleasure
to
me
i
only
call
on
the
people
you
ought
to
call
on
and
keep
up
a
few
acquaintances
for
the
children
sake
you
would
have
us
without
a
friend
in
the
world
when
the
girls
come
out
and
really
what
with
regimental
duties
in
the
morning
and
insects
afterwards
edward
you
are
so
absorbed
that
if
it
was
for
a
lady
friend
coming
in
now
and
then
i
should
hardly
have
a
soul
to
speak
to
the
major
was
melted
in
a
moment
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
very
inattentive
husband
he
said
you
must
forgive
me
my
dear
and
this
sprained
ankle
keeping
me
in
makes
me
cross
too
and
i
had
so
reckoned
on
these
days
at
home
to
finish
my
list
of
coleoptera
and
get
some
dissecting
and
mounting
done
but
minchin
brought
her
work
directly
after
breakfast
and
that
fellow
elliott
dropped
in
for
lunch
and
we
had
callers
all
the
afternoon
and
a
for
tea
and
john
who
seems
to
get
through
life
somehow
without
the
most
indefinite
notion
of
how
time
passes
came
in
just
when
tea
was
over
and
you
had
to
order
a
fresh
supply
when
we
should
have
been
dressing
for
dinner
and
the
dinner
was
spoilt
by
waiting
till
she
discovered
that
she
had
no
idea
whoever
did
know
her
have
an
idea
how
late
it
was
and
that
john
would
be
so
angry
and
now
you
want
me
to
go
in
a
cab
to
a
concert
at
the
rooms
to
meet
all
these
people
over
again
i
sure
i
do
care
for
john
a
bit
more
than
you
do
said
buller
and
really
she
does
repeat
such
things
sometimes
without
ever
looking
round
to
see
if
the
girls
are
in
the
room
she
told
me
a
thing
that
old
lady
watford
had
told
her
my
dear
her
ladyship
stories
are
well
known
cremorne
wife
hears
them
from
her
and
tells
them
to
her
husband
and
he
tells
them
to
the
other
fellows
i
can
always
hear
them
if
i
wish
but
i
do
not
care
to
but
if
you
do
like
john
theresa
what
on
earth
made
you
ask
her
to
come
and
sit
with
you
in
the
morning
well
my
dear
what
can
i
do
said
buller
she
always
saying
that
everybody
is
so
unsociable
and
that
she
is
so
dull
she
know
what
to
do
with
herself
and
begging
me
to
take
my
work
and
go
and
sit
with
her
in
a
morning
how
can
i
go
and
leave
the
children
and
the
servants
just
at
the
time
of
day
when
everything
wants
to
be
set
going
so
i
thought
i
better
ask
her
to
come
here
instead
it
a
great
bore
but
i
can
keep
an
eye
over
the
house
and
if
any
one
else
drops
in
i
can
leave
them
together
it
not
me
that
she
wants
it
something
to
amuse
her
you
talk
about
my
having
nothing
to
do
aunt
theresa
plaintively
continued
but
i
sure
i
can
hardly
sleep
at
night
sometimes
for
thinking
of
all
i
ought
to
do
and
have
done
jerrold
you
know
made
me
promise
faithfully
when
we
were
coming
away
to
write
to
her
every
mail
and
i
never
find
time
every
week
as
it
comes
round
i
think
i
will
and
ca
i
used
to
think
that
one
good
thing
about
coming
home
would
be
the
no
more
writing
for
the
english
mail
but
the
indian
mail
is
quite
as
bad
and
i
sure
seems
to
come
round
quicker
than
any
other
day
of
the
week
i
quite
dread
fridays
and
then
your
mother
and
sisters
are
always
saying
i
never
write
and
i
heard
from
pryce
smith
only
this
morning
telling
me
i
owed
her
two
letters
and
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
her
when
i
do
write
for
she
knows
nobody
and
i
know
nobody
and
we
never
returned
the
ridgeways
call
my
dear
and
we
never
called
on
the
mercers
since
we
dined
there
and
kirkshaw
is
always
begging
me
to
drive
out
and
spend
the
day
at
the
abbey
i
know
she
is
getting
offended
put
her
off
so
often
and
minchin
says
she
is
very
touchy
and
taylor
looks
quite
reproachfully
at
me
because
i
not
been
near
the
dorcas
meetings
for
so
long
but
it
all
very
well
for
people
who
have
no
children
to
work
at
these
things
a
mother
time
is
not
her
own
and
charity
begins
at
home
i
sure
i
never
seem
to
be
at
rest
and
yet
people
are
never
satisfied
lady
burchett
says
she
certain
i
am
never
at
home
for
she
always
misses
me
when
she
calls
and
graham
says
i
never
go
out
she
sure
for
she
never
meets
me
anywhere
is
all
that
just
what
i
say
said
major
buller
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
the
discussion
took
place
at
dinner
it
the
tyranny
of
the
idle
over
the
busy
and
why
in
the
name
of
common
sense
should
it
be
yielded
to
why
should
friends
be
obliged
at
the
peril
of
disparagement
of
their
affection
or
good
manners
to
visit
each
other
when
they
do
not
want
to
go
to
receive
each
other
when
it
is
not
convenient
and
to
write
to
each
other
when
there
is
nothing
to
say
you
women
my
dear
i
must
say
are
more
foolish
in
this
respect
than
men
men
simply
wo
write
long
letters
to
their
friends
when
nothing
to
say
and
i
do
think
their
friendships
suffer
by
it
and
though
there
are
heaps
of
idle
gossiping
fellows
as
well
as
ladies
with
the
same
qualities
a
man
who
was
busy
would
never
tolerate
them
to
his
own
inconvenience
much
less
invite
them
to
persecute
him
we
are
more
straightforward
with
each
other
and
that
is
after
all
the
firmest
foundation
for
friendship
it
is
partly
a
misplaced
amiability
a
phase
of
the
unselfishness
in
which
you
excel
us
and
partly
also
i
think
a
want
of
some
measuring
quality
that
makes
you
women
exact
unreasonable
things
make
impossible
promises
and
after
blandly
undertaking
a
multiplicity
of
small
matters
that
would
tax
the
method
of
a
man
of
business
to
accomplish
punctually
put
your
whole
time
at
the
disposal
of
every
fool
who
is
pleased
to
waste
it
it
all
very
well
talking
edward
said
aunt
theresa
but
what
is
one
to
do
make
a
stand
said
the
major
when
you
busy
and
conveniently
see
people
let
your
servant
tell
them
so
in
as
many
words
the
friendship
that
ca
survive
that
is
hardly
worth
keeping
i
think
eh
my
dear
but
i
suppose
the
stand
was
to
be
made
further
on
for

theresa
to
the
concert

rooms
chapter
vi
dress
and
manner
i
examine
myself
my
when
we
began
our
biographies
we
resolved
that
neither
of
us
should
read
the
other
till
both
were
finished
this
was
partly
because
we
thought
it
would
be
more
satisfactory
to
be
able
to
go
straight
through
them
partly
as
a
check
on
a
propensity
for
beginning
things
and
not
finishing
them
to
which
we
are
liable
and
partly
from
the
childish
habit
of
saving
up
the
treat
for
the
last
as
we
used
in
old
times
to
pick
the
raisins
out
of
the
puddings
and
lay
them
by
for
a
when
we
should
have
done
our
duty
by
the
more
solid
portion
but
our
resolve
has
given
way
we
began
by
very
much
wishing
to
break
it
and
we
have
ended
by
finding
excellent
reasons
for
doing
so
we
both
wish
to
read
the
biographies
why
should
we
tease
ourselves
by
sticking
obstinately
to
our
first
opinion
no
doubt
it
would
be
nice
to
read
them
straight
through
but
we
are
rather
apt
to
devour
books
at
a
pace
unfavourable
to
so
perhaps
it
will
be
better
still
to
read
them
by
bits
as
one
reads
a
thing
that
comes
out
in
numbers
and
in
short
at
this
point
eleanor
took
mine
and
has
read
it
and
i
have
read
hers
she
lays
down
mine
saying
but
my
dear
you
remember
all
this
which
is
true
what
i
have
recorded
of
my
first
english
home
is
more
what
i
know
of
it
from
other
sources
than
what
i
positively
remember
and
yet
i
have
positive
memories
of
my
own
about
it
too
i
have
hinted
that
my
poor
young
mother
did
not
look
after
me
much
also
that
the
ayah
who
had
a
mother
love
and
care
for
me
paid
very
little
attention
to
my
being
tidy
in
person
or
dress
except
when
i
was
exhibited
to
company
but
my
mother
was
dead
ayah
after
a
terrible
parting
was
left
behind
in
india
and
from
the
time
that
i
passed
into
aunt
theresa
charge
matters
were
quite
changed
i
do
remember
the
dresses
i
had
then
and
the
keen
interest
i
took
in
the
subject
of
dress
at
a
very
early
age
a
very
keen
interest
was
taken
in
it
by
aunt
theresa
herself
by
aunt
theresa
daughters
and
by
the
ladies
of
aunt
theresa
acquaintance
i
think
i
may
say
that
it
formed
at
least
one
of
the
principal
subjects
of
conversation
during
all
those
working
hours
of
the
day
which
the
ladies
so
freely
sacrificed
to
each
other
buller
was
truly
kind
and
i
am
sure
that
if
i
had
depended
in
every
way
upon
her
she
would
have
given
to
my
costume
as
much
care
as
she
bestowed
upon
that
of
her
own
daughters
but
my
parents
had
not
been
poor
there
was
no
lack
of
money
for
my
maintenance
and
thus
no
reason
as
aunt
theresa
said
why
my
clothes
should
not
be
decent
and
decent
with
aunt
theresa
and
her
friends
was
a
synonym
for
fashionable
thus
my
first
black
frock
was
such
an
improvement
in
fashion
upon
the
pink
silk
one
as
to
deprive
my
deep
mourning
of
much
of
its
gloom
colonel
quentin
could
not
refuse
to
lend
one
of
her
youngest
little
girl
frocks
as
a
copy
for
the
poor
little
orphan
and
a
bevy
of
ladies
sat
in
consultation
over
it
for
all
quentin
things
were
well
worth
copying
keep
a
paper
pattern
dear
said
minchin
it
will
come
in
for
the
girls
her
things
are
always
good
and
buller
kept
a
paper
pattern
i
remember
the
dress
quite
clearly
it
is
fixed
in
my
mind
by
an
incident
connected
with
it
it
had
six
crape
tucks
of
which
fact
i
was
very
proud
having
heard
a
good
deal
said
about
it
the
first
time
george
came
to
our
bungalow
after
i
had
begun
to
wear
it
i
strutted
up
to
him
holding
my
skirt
out
and
my
head
up
look
at
my
black
frock
george
said
i
it
has
got
six
crape
tucks
matilda
was
most
precocious
in
at
least
one
way
she
could
repeat
observations
of
wonderful
length
it
the
best
crape
she
said
it
wo
spot
cut
on
the
bias
they
not
real
tucks
though
margery
they
laid
on
minchin
said
so
they
are
real
tucks
i
stoutly
asserted
no
they
not
they
cut
on
the
bias
and
laid
on
to
imitate
tucks
matilda
repeated
i
think
she
was
not
sorry
there
should
be
some
weak
point
in
the
fashionable
mourning
in
which
she
did
not
share
i
turned
to
george
as
usual
are
they
real
tucks
mr
george
but
george
had
a
strange
look
on
his
face
which
puzzled
and
disconcerted
me
he
only
said
good
heavens
and
all
my
after
efforts
were
vain
to
find
out
what
he
meant
and
why
he
looked
in
that
strange
manner
little
things
that
puzzle
one
in
childhood
remain
long
in
one
memory
for
years
i
puzzled
over
that
look
of
george
and
the
remembrance
never
was
a
pleasant
one
it
chilled
my
enthusiasm
for
my
new
dress
at
the
time
and
made
me
feel
inclined
to
cry
i
think
i
have
lived
to
understand
it
but
i
was
not
insensible
of
my
great
loss
though
i
took
pride
in
my
fashionable
mourning
i
do
not
think
i
much
connected
the
two
in
my
mind
i
did
not
talk
about
my
father
to
any
one
but
george
but
at
night
i
often
lay
awake
and
cried
about
him
this
habit
certainly
affected
my
health
and
i
had
become
a
very
thin
weak
child
when
the
home
voyage
came
to
restore
my
strength
by
the
time
we
reached
riflebury
my
fashionable
new
dress
was
neither
new
nor
fashionable
it
was
then
that
minchin
ferreted
out
a
dressmaker
whom
quentin
employed
and
i
was
put
under
her
hands
the
little
bullers
things
were
made
in
the
house
after
the
pattern
of
mine
and
one
sees
the
and
gets
a
few
hints
said
buller
if
george
was
not
duly
impressed
by
my
fashionable
mourning
i
could
young
as
i
was
trace
the
effect
of
aunt
theresa
care
for
my
appearance
on
other
friends
in
the
regiment
they
openly
remarked
on
it
and
did
not
scruple
to
do
so
in
my
hearing
callers
from
the
neighbourhood
patronized
me
also
pretty
ladies
in
fashionably
pitched
bonnets
smiled
and
said
one
of
your
little
ones
buller
what
a
pretty
little
thing
and
duly
sympathized
over
the
sad
story
which
aunt
theresa
seemed
almost
to
enjoy
relating
sometimes
it
was
agony
to
me
to
hear
the
tale
of
my
parents
death
and
then
again
i
enjoyed
a
sort
of
gloomy
importance
which
gave
me
satisfaction
i
even
rehearsed
such
scenes
in
my
mind
when
i
was
in
bed
shedding
real
tears
as
in
the
person
of
aunt
theresa
i
related
the
sad
circumstances
of
my
own
grief
to
an
imaginary
acquaintance
and
then
with
dry
eyes
prolonging
the
fancy
with
compliments
and
consolations
of
the
most
flattering
nature
i
always
took
care
to
fancy
some
circumstances
that
led
to
my
being
in
my
best
dress
on
the
occasion
gentleman
company
did
not
haunt
my
new
home
as
was
the
case
with
the
indian
one
but
now
and
then
officers
of
the
regiment
called
on
buller
and
would
say
is
that
poor
vandaleur
child
dear
me
very
interesting
little
thing
and
speculate
in
my
hearing
on
the
possibility
of
my
growing
up
like
my
mother
my
soul
she
like
her
said
one
of
the
middle
ones
one
day
examining
me
through
his
eyeglass
th
same
expressive
eyes
you
know
and
just
that
graceful
gracious
little
manner
poor
vandaleur
had
by
jove
it
was
a
shocking
thing
she
was
an
uncommonly
pretty
woman
you
never
saw
mother
my
good
fellow
said
one
of
the
old
ones
who
was
present
she
a
graceful
gracious
manner
if
you
like
and
vandaleur
was
not
to
be
named
in
the
same
day
with
her
vandaleur
knew
how
to
dress
i
grant
you
you
may
go
and
play
margery
dear
said
aunt
theresa
with
kindly
delicacy
the
old
one
had
lowered
his
voice
but
still
i
could
hear
what
he
said
as
buller
saw
when
my
father
was
not
spoken
of
my
feelings
were
very
little
hurt
on
this
occasion
my
mind
was
engaged
simply
with
the
question
whether
i
did
or
did
not
inherit
my
mother
graces
i
ran
to
a
little
in
the
nursery
and
examined
my
eyes
but
when
i
tried
to
make
them
expressive
i
either
frowned
so
unpleasantly
or
stared
so
absurdly
that
i
could
not
flatter
myself
on
the
point
the
girls
were
out
i
had
nothing
to
do
the
nursery
was
empty
i
walked
about
shaking
out
my
skirts
and
thinking
of
my
gracious
and
graceful
manner
i
felt
a
pardonable
curiosity
to
see
this
for
myself
and
remembering
the
big
glass
in
aunt
theresa
room
i
stole
out
to
see
if
i
could
make
use
of
it
unobserved
but
the
gentlemen
had
gone
and
i
feared
that
buller
might
come
in
a
few
minutes
however
the
rang
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
visitor
being
ushered
into
the
i
seized
the
chance
and
ran
to
aunt
theresa
room
the
mirror
was
full
length
and
no
one
could
see
me
better
than
i
now
saw
myself
once
more
i
attempted
to
make
expressive
eyes
but
the
result
was
not
favourable
to
vanity
then
i
drew
back
to
the
door
and
advancing
upon
the
mirror
with
mincing
steps
i
threw
all
the
grace
and
graciousness
of
which
i
was
conscious
into
my
manner
and
holding
out
my
hand
said
in
a
company
voice
to
see
you
i
sure
bien
drôle
said
a
soft
voice
close
behind
me
i
had
not
heard
the
door
open
and
yet
there
stood
aunt
theresa
on
the
threshold
and
with
her
a
little
old
lady
the
little
old
lady
had
a
bright
delicately
cut
face
eyes
of
whose
expressiveness
there
could
be
no
question
and
large
grey
curls
she
wore
a
large
hat
with
large
bows
tied
under
her
chin
and
a
satin
lined
with
white
and
grey
fur
she
looked
like
a
fairy
godmother
like
the
ghost
of
an
ancestor
like
somebody
out
of
a
picture
she
was
my
chapter
vii
my
the
duchess
carriage
is
curious
i
was
much
discomfited
my
position
was
not
a
dignified
one
at
the
best
and
in
childhood
such
small
shames
seem
too
terrible
ever
to
be
outlived
my
laughed
heartily
and
buller
whose
sense
of
humour
was
small
looked
annoyed
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
margery
she
said
i
had
little
or
no
moral
courage
and
i
had
not
been
trained
in
high
principles
if
i
could
have
thought
of
a
plausible
lie
i
fear
i
should
have
told
it
in
my
dilemma
as
it
was
i
could
not
i
only
put
my
hand
to
my
burning
cheek
and
said
let
me
see
i
must
certainly
have
presented
a
very
comical
appearance
but
the
little
old
lady
smiles
died
away
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
it
is
strange
is
it
not
she
said
to
aunt
theresa
that
after
all
i
should
laugh
at
this
meeting
then
sitting
down
on
a
box
by
the
door
she
held
out
her
hands
to
me
saying
come
little
margery
there
is
no
sin
in
practising
one
good
manners
before
the
mirror
come
and
kiss
me
dear
child
i
am
your
father
mother
is
not
that
to
be
an
old
woman
i
am
your
my
voice
was
very
soft
her
cheek
was
soft
her
cloak
was
soft
i
buried
my
face
in
the
fur
and
cried
quietly
to
myself
with
shame
and
excitement
she
stroking
my
head
and
saying
petite
thou
an
orphan
and
i
doubly
childless
it
is
thus
we
meet
at
last
to
join
our
hands
across
the
graves
of
two
generations
of
those
we
love
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
said
buller
rummaging
in
her
pocket
for
a
clean
handkerchief
i
sure
i
never
should
forget
it
if
i
lived
a
thousand
years
i
never
seemed
able
to
realize
that
they
were
gone
it
was
all
so
sudden
the
old
lady
made
no
answer
and
we
all
wept
in
silence
aunt
theresa
was
the
first
to
recover
herself
and
she
insisted
on
our
coming
a
young
regimental
surgeon
and
his
wife
dropped
in
to
lunch
for
which
my
stayed
we
were
sitting
in
the
afterwards
when
vandaleur
carriage
was
announced
as
my
took
leave
of
me
she
took
off
a
watch
and
chain
and
hung
them
on
my
neck
it
was
a
small
french
watch
with
an
enamelled
back
of
dark
blue
on
which
was
the
word
souvenir
in
small
pearls
i
gave
it
to
your
grandfather
long
years
ago
my
child
and
he
gave
it
back
to
me
before
he
sailed
i
would
only
part
with
it
to
his
child
farewell
be
good
dear
child
try
to
be
good
adieu
buller
and
a
thousand
thanks
major
buller
i
am
at
your
service
major
buller
took
the
hand
she
held
out
to
him
and
led
the
old
lady
to
the
front
door
whither
we
all
followed
them
vandaleur
carriage
was
before
the
steps
it
was
a
very
quaint
little
box
on
two
wheels
in
by
no
means
good
repair
it
was
drawn
by
a
pony
white
old
and
shaggy
at
the
pony
head
stood
a
small
boy
in
decent
but
not
smart
plain
clothes
put
the
mat
over
the
wheel
to
save
my
dress
adolphe
said
the
old
lady
and
as
the
little
boy
obeyed
her
order
she
stepped
nimbly
into
the
carriage
assisted
by
the
major
the
silk
is
old
she
observed
complacently
but
it
is
my
best
of
course
or
it
would
not
have
been
worn
and
she
gave
a
graceful
little
bow
towards
aunt
theresa
and
i
hope
that
with
care
it
will
serve
as
such
for
the
rest
of
my
life
which
can
not
be
very
long
if
it
wears
as
well
as
you
do
madam
said
major
buller
tucking
her
in
it
may
not
otherwise
the
surgeon
was
leaning
over
the
other
side
of
the
little
cart
and
seemed
also
to
be
making
polite
speeches
it
recalled
the
way
that
men
used
to
hang
upon
my
mother
carriage
the
old
lady
smiled
and
made
gracious
little
replies
and
meanwhile
deliberately
took
off
her
kid
gloves
folded
and
put
them
into
her
pocket
she
then
drew
on
a
pair
of
old
worsted
ones
economy
economy
she
said
smiling
and
giving
a
hand
on
each
side
of
her
to
the
two
gentlemen
may
i
trouble
you
for
the
reins
many
thanks
farewell
gentlemen
i
can
not
pretend
to
fear
that
my
horse
will
catch
cold
his
coat
is
too
thick
but
you
may
adieu
buller
once
more
farewell
little
one
i
wish
you
madam
adolphe
seat
yourself
make
your
bow
adolphe
adieu
dear
friends
she
gave
a
flick
with
the
whip
which
the
pony
resented
by
shaking
his
head
after
which
he
seemed
so
to
speak
to
snatch
up
the
little
cart
my
and
adolphe
and
to
run
off
with
them
at
a
good
round
pace
what
an
extraordinary
said
the
surgeon
wife
she
was
an
irish
attorney
daughter
with
the
commonest
of
faces
and
the
most
unprecedented
of
bonnets
she
and
her
husband
had
lately
set
up
a
waggonette
the
expense
of
which
just
made
it
difficult
for
them
to
live
upon
their
means
and
the
varnish
of
which
added
a
care
to
life
fancy
driving
down
high
street
in
that
she
continued
and
just
when
everybody
is
going
out
too
uncommon
sensible
little
affair
i
think
said
the
surgeon
suits
the
old
lady
capitally
vandaleur
said
major
buller
can
afford
to
be
independent
of
appearances
to
an
extent
that
would
not
perhaps
be
safe
for
most
of
us
you
right
there
buller
said
the
surgeon
wonderfully
queenly
she
is
that
fur
cloak
looks
like
an
ermine
robe
on
her
i
do
think
you
like
to
see
me
in
it
tittered
his
wife
i
do
say
i
should
returned
the
surgeon
rather
smartly
my
dear
said
buller
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
be
jealous
of
the
duchess
all
gentlemen
are
mad
about
her
the
duchess
said
in
a
tone
of
respect
i
thought
you
said
oh
she
is
not
really
a
duchess
my
dear
it
only
a
nickname
tell
you
all
about
it
some
day
it
a
long
story
discovering
that
vandaleur
was
a
family
connection
and
not
a
chance
visitor
from
the
neighbourhood
apologized
for
her
remarks
and
tried
to
extract
the
duchess
history
from
aunt
theresa
then
and
there
but
buller
would
only
promise
to
tell
it
another
time
i
dying
with
curiosity
said
as
she
took
leave
i
shall
run
in
afternoon
on
purpose
to
hear
all
about
it
can
you
do
with
me
dear
mrs
buller
pray
come
said
aunt
theresa
warmly
with
an
amiable
disregard
of
two
engagements
and
some
arrears
of
domestic
business
i
was
in
the
next
day
when
arrived
may
i
come
in
dear
mrs
buller
she
said
i
wo
stay
two
minutes
but
i
hear
about
the
duchess
now
you
busy
not
at
all
said
aunt
theresa
who
was
in
the
midst
of
making
up
her
tradesmen
books
pray
sit
down
and
take
off
your
bonnet
it
hardly
worth
while
for
i
stay
said
taking
her
bonnet
off
and
setting
it
down
so
as
not
to
crush
the
flowers
as
stayed
two
hours
and
a
half
and
as
aunt
theresa
granted
my
request
to
be
allowed
to
hear
her
narrative
i
learnt
a
good
deal
of
the
history
of
my
chapter
viii
a
family
history
we
are
not
really
connected
buller
began
she
is
and
margery
and
i
are
second
cousins
that
all
but
i
knew
her
long
ago
before
my
poor
cousin
alice
married
captain
vandaleur
and
i
have
heard
the
whole
story
over
and
over
again
i
have
heard
the
story
more
than
once
also
i
listened
with
open
mouth
to
aunt
theresa
at
this
time
and
often
afterwards
questioned
her
about
my
ancestors
as
i
may
almost
call
them
years
later
i
used
to
repeat
these
histories
to
girls
i
was
with
when
we
were
on
good
terms
they
were
interested
to
hear
as
i
was
proud
to
tell
and
would
say
tell
us
about
your
ancestors
margery
and
if
we
fell
out
there
was
no
surer
method
of
annoying
me
than
to
slight
the
memory
of
my
i
have
told
their
story
pretty
often
i
shall
put
it
down
here
in
my
own
way
for
aunt
theresa
told
a
story
rather
disconnectedly
the
de
vandaleurs
we
have
dropped
the
now
were
an
old
french
family
there
was
a
duke
in
it
who
was
killed
in
the
revolution
of
and
most
of
the
family
emigrated
and
were
very
poor
the
title
was
restored
afterwards
and
some
of
the
property
it
went
to
a
cousin
of
the
duke
who
was
murdered
he
having
no
surviving
children
but
they
say
it
went
in
the
wrong
line
the
cousin
who
had
remained
in
france
and
always
managed
to
keep
the
favour
of
the
ruling
powers
got
the
title
and
remade
his
fortunes
the
others
remained
in
england
very
poor
and
very
proud
they
would
not
have
accepted
any
favours
from
the
new
royal
family
but
still
they
considered
themselves
deprived
of
their
rights
one
of
these
vandaleur
the
one
who
ought
to
have
been
the
duke
had
married
his
cousin
they
suffered
great
hardships
in
their
escape
i
fancy
and
on
the
birth
of
their
son
shortly
after
their
arrival
in
england
the
wife
died
there
was
an
old
woman
aunt
theresa
said
who
used
to
be
her
nurse
when
she
was
a
child
in
london
who
had
lived
as
a
girl
in
the
wretched
lodgings
where
these
poor
people
were
when
they
came
over
and
she
used
to
tell
her
wonderful
stories
about
them
how
in
her
delirium
she
was
insane
for
some
little
time
before
her
son
was
born
madame
de
vandaleur
fancied
herself
in
her
old
home
with
all
her
finery
about
her
as
nurse
brown
used
to
say
nurse
brown
seems
to
have
had
very
little
sympathy
with
nervous
diseases
she
could
understand
a
broken
leg
or
a
fever
when
folks
kept
their
beds
but
the
disordered
fancies
of
a
brain
tried
just
too
far
the
mad
whims
of
a
lady
who
could
go
about
and
who
insisted
upon
going
about
and
changing
her
dress
two
or
three
times
a
day
and
receiving
imaginary
visitors
and
ordering
her
faithful
nurse
up
and
down
under
the
names
of
servants
she
no
longer
possessed
were
beyond
her
comprehension
aunt
theresa
said
that
she
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
had
the
deepest
pity
for
the
poor
lady
they
thought
it
so
romantic
that
she
should
cry
for
fresh
flowers
and
dress
herself
to
meet
the
queen
in
a
dirty
little
lodging
at
the
back
of
leicester
square
and
they
were
always
begging
to
hear
what
else
she
did
but
nurse
brown
seems
to
have
been
fondest
of
relating
the
smart
speeches
in
which
she
endeavoured
to
put
sense
into
the
devoted
french
servant
who
toiled
to
humour
every
whim
of
her
unhappy
mistress
instead
of
being
sharp
with
her
as
nurse
brown
advised
aunt
theresa
had
some
doubts
whether
brown
ever
did
make
the
speeches
she
reported
but
when
people
say
they
said
this
or
that
they
often
only
mean
that
this
or
that
is
what
they
wish
they
had
said
if
she
mad
i
says
shave
her
head
instead
of
dressing
her
hair
all
day
long
i
knowed
mad
people
as
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
rolled
their
eyes
and
would
have
done
themselves
a
injury
but
for
a
and
i
knowed
folks
in
fevers
unreasonable
enough
but
they
kept
their
beds
in
a
dark
room
and
did
know
their
own
mothers
madame
ways
is
beyond
me
i
says
calls
it
madness
calls
it
temper
tem
per
and
no
thing
else
aunt
theresa
used
to
make
us
laugh
by
repeating
nurse
brown
sayings
and
the
little
shake
of
herself
with
which
she
emphasized
the
last
sentence
if
she
had
no
sympathy
for
madame
de
vandaleur
she
had
a
double
share
for
the
poor
lady
husband
a
soul
as
she
used
to
call
him
it
was
in
vain
that
jeanette
spoke
of
the
sweet
temper
and
unselfishness
of
her
mistress
before
these
terrible
days
her
conduct
towards
her
husband
then
was
enough
for
nurse
brown
so
she
said
no
sooner
had
the
poor
gentleman
gone
off
on
some
errand
for
her
pleasure
than
she
called
for
him
to
be
with
her
and
was
only
to
be
pacified
by
a
fable
of
jeanette
devising
who
always
said
that
the
king
had
summoned
monsieur
de
vandaleur
jeanette
was
well
aware
that
the
childless
old
duke
being
dead
her
master
had
succeeded
to
the
title
and
she
often
spoke
of
him
as
monsieur
le
duc
to
his
wife
which
seems
to
have
pleased
the
poor
lady
when
he
was
absent
jeanette
ready
excuse
madame
pour
monsieur
le
duc
le
roi
fait
was
enough
and
she
waited
patiently
for
his
return
as
her
whims
and
fancies
were
the
poor
gentleman
sacrificed
everything
to
gratify
them
his
watch
his
rings
his
buckles
the
lace
from
his
shirt
and
all
the
few
trifles
secured
in
their
hasty
flight
were
sold
one
by
one
his
face
was
familiar
to
the
keepers
of
certain
stalls
near
to
where
covent
garden
market
now
stands
he
bought
flowers
for
madame
when
he
could
not
afford
himself
food
he
sold
his
waistcoat
and
buttoned
his
coat
across
him
and
looked
thinner
than
ever
then
the
day
came
when
madame
wished
and
he
could
not
gratify
her
wish
everything
was
gone
he
said
this
will
kill
me
jeanette
and
jeanette
believed
him
nurse
brown
according
to
her
own
account
assured
jeanette
that
it
would
not
folk
does
die
of
such
things
says
i
but
in
spite
of
and
experience
monsieur
de
vandaleur
did
die
of
grief
or
something
very
like
it
within
hours
of
the
death
of
his
wife
and
the
birth
of
their
only
son
for
some
years
the
faithful
jeanette
supported
this
child
by
her
own
industry
she
was
an
exquisite
laundress
and
she
throve
where
the
duke
and
duchess
would
have
starved
as
the
boy
grew
up
she
kept
him
as
far
as
possible
from
common
companions
treated
him
with
as
much
deference
as
if
he
had
succeeded
to
the
family
honours
and
filled
his
head
with
traditions
of
the
deserts
and
dignity
of
the
de
vandaleurs
at
last
a
cousin
of
monsieur
de
vandaleur
found
them
out
he
also
was
an
exile
but
he
had
prospered
better
had
got
a
small
civil
appointment
and
had
married
a
scotch
lady
it
was
after
he
had
come
to
the
help
of
his
young
kinsman
i
think
that
an
old
french
lady
took
a
fancy
to
the
boy
and
sent
him
to
school
in
france
at
her
own
expense
he
was
just
nineteen
when
she
died
and
left
him
what
little
money
she
possessed
he
then
returned
to
england
and
paid
his
respects
to
his
cousin
and
the
scotch
vandaleur
she
congratulated
herself
i
have
heard
that
her
only
child
a
daughter
was
from
home
when
this
visit
was
paid
janet
vandaleur
was
a
woman
she
valued
long
descent
and
noble
blood
and
loyalty
to
a
fallen
dynasty
like
a
scotchwoman
but
like
a
scotchwoman
she
also
respected
capability
and
energy
and
endurance
she
combined
a
romantic
heart
with
a
practical
head
in
a
way
peculiar
to
her
nation
she
knew
the
pedigree
of
every
family
who
had
a
pedigree
north
of
the
tweed
and
was
probably
the
best
housekeeper
in
great
britain
she
devoutly
believed
her
own
husband
to
be
as
perfect
as
mortal
man
may
be
here
below
whilst
in
some
separate
compartment
of
her
brain
she
had
the
keenest
sense
of
the
defects
and
weaknesses
which
he
inherited
and
dreaded
nothing
more
than
to
see
her
daughter
mated
with
one
of
the
helpless
vandaleurs
this
daughter
with
much
of
her
mother
strong
will
and
practical
capacity
had
got
her
father
and
a
good
deal
of
his
artistic
temperament
dreading
the
development
of
qualities
in
her
the
mother
made
her
education
studiously
practical
and
orderly
she
had
like
most
scotch
matrons
of
her
type
too
good
a
gift
for
telling
family
stories
and
too
high
a
respect
for
ancestral
traditions
to
have
quite
kept
herself
from
amusing
her
childhood
with
tales
of
the
de
vandaleur
greatness
but
after
her
husband
discovered
his
young
relative
and
as
their
daughter
grew
up
she
purposely
avoided
the
subject
which
had
probably
the
sole
effect
of
increasing
her
daughter
interest
in
the
family
romance
janet
knew
the
de
vandaleur
pedigree
as
well
as
her
own
and
had
shown
a
miniature
of
the
late
duke
in
his
youth
to
her
daughter
as
a
child
on
many
occasions
when
she
had
also
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
title
by
birth
was
undoubtedly
in
the
exiled
branch
of
the
family
miss
vandaleur
was
not
ignorant
that
the
young
gentleman
who
had
just
completed
his
education
was
if
every
one
had
their
rights
monsieur
le
duc
and
she
was
as
much
disappointed
to
have
missed
seeing
him
as
her
mother
was
glad
that
they
had
not
met
for
bertrand
de
vandaleur
had
all
the
virtues
and
the
weaknesses
of
his
family
in
intense
proportions
he
had
a
hopeless
ignorance
of
the
value
of
money
which
was
his
strongest
condemnation
before
his
scotch
cousin
he
was
chivalrous
in
some
points
accomplished
charming
and
but
he
was
weak
of
will
merely
passive
in
endurance
and
quite
without
energy
he
had
a
graceful
fanciful
but
almost
weak
intellect
i
mean
it
just
bordered
on
mental
deficiency
and
at
times
his
dreamy
eyes
took
a
wildness
that
was
said
to
make
him
painfully
like
his
mother
in
her
last
days
he
was
an
absurd
but
gracefully
romantic
idea
of
his
family
consequence
he
was
very
handsome
and
very
like
the
miniature
of
the
late
duke
it
was
most
desirable
that
his
cousin
should
not
meet
him
especially
as
she
was
of
the
sentimental
age
of
seventeen
so
janet
vandaleur
hastened
their
return
from
london
to
their
small
property
in
scotland
but
there
was
no
law
to
hinder
monsieur
de
vandaleur
from
making
a
scotch
tour
one
summer
afternoon
when
she
had
just
finished
the
making
of
some
preserves
miss
vandaleur
strolled
down
through
a
little
wood
behind
the
house
towards
a
favourite
beck
that
ran
in
a
gorge
below
she
was
singing
an
old
french
song
in
praise
of
the
beauty
of
a
fair
lady
of
the
de
vandaleurs
of
olden
time
as
she
finished
the
first
verse
a
voice
from
a
short
distance
took
up
the
refrain
victoire
de
vandaleur
victoire
victoire
it
was
her
own
name
as
well
as
that
of
her
ancestress
and
she
blushed
as
her
eyes
met
those
of
a
strange
young
gentleman
with
a
in
his
hand
and
a
french
poodle
at
his
heels
place
aux
dames
said
the
stranger
on
which
the
white
poodle
sat
up
and
his
master
bowed
till
his
head
nearly
touched
the
ground
they
had
met
once
as
children
which
was
introduction
enough
in
the
circumstances
here
at
last
for
victoire
was
the
embodiment
of
all
her
dreams
of
the
de
vandaleur
race
he
was
personally
so
like
the
miniature
that
he
might
have
been
the
old
duke
he
was
the
young
one
as
even
her
mother
allowed
for
him
he
found
a
companion
whose
birth
did
not
jar
on
his
aristocratic
prejudices
and
whose
strong
character
was
bone
and
marrow
to
his
weak
one
before
they
reached
the
house
janet
precautions
were
vain
she
grew
fond
of
the
lad
in
spite
of
herself
the
romantic
side
of
her
sympathized
with
his
history
he
was
an
orphan
and
she
had
a
heart
in
the
direct
line
he
was
a
duke
and
she
was
a
scotchwoman
he
freely
consented
to
settle
every
penny
he
had
upon
his
wife
and
as
his
justly
remarked
many
a
cannier
man
would
just
have
done
that
in
fine
the
young
people
were
married
with
not
more
than
the
usual
difficulties
beforehand
he
was
nineteen
and
she
was
seventeen
they
were
my
and
they
had
only
one
child
a
son
they
were
very
poor
and
yet
they
gave
him
a
good
education
i
ought
to
say
gave
him
for
everything
that
needed
effort
or
energy
was
done
by
my
the
more
it
became
evident
that
her
bertrand
de
vandaleur
was
less
helpful
and
practical
than
any
bertrand
de
vandaleur
before
him
the
more
there
seems
to
have
developed
in
her
the
purpose
and
capability
inherited
from
janet
like
many
another
poor
and
ambitious
mother
she
studied
latin
and
greek
and
algebra
that
she
might
teach
her
son
and
at
the
same
time
she
saved
even
out
of
their
small
income
she
began
to
put
by
from
the
boy
birth
for
his
education
and
when
the
time
came
he
was
sent
to
school
my
grandfather
did
well
i
have
heard
that
he
inherited
his
beauty
and
was
not
without
his
mother
sense
and
energy
he
had
the
de
vandaleur
quality
of
pleasing
with
the
weakness
of
being
utterly
ruled
by
the
woman
he
loved
at
twenty
he
married
an
heiress
his
parents
had
themselves
married
too
early
to
have
reasonable
ground
for
complaint
at
this
but
when
he
left
his
own
church
for
that
of
his
wife
there
came
a
terrible
breach
between
them
and
their
only
son
his
mother
soon
forgave
him
but
the
father
was
as
immovable
in
his
displeasure
as
weak
people
can
sometimes
be
happily
however
after
the
birth
of
a
grandson
peace
was
made
and
the
young
husband
brought
his
wife
to
visit
his
parents
the
heiress
had
some
property
in
the
west
indies
which
they
proposed
to
visit
and
they
remained
with
the
old
people
till
just
before
they
sailed
it
was
as
a
keepsake
at
parting
that
my
grandfather
had
restored
to
his
mother
the
watch
which
she
gave
to
me
the
child
was
left
in
england
with
his
mother
relations
my
grandfather
and
grandmother
never
returned
they
were
among
the
countless
victims
of
the
most
cruel
of
all
seas
the
vessel
they
went
out
in
was
lost
during
a
week
of
storms
on
what
day
or
night
and
in
what
part
of
the
atlantic
no
one
survived
to
tell
their
orphan
child
was
my
dear
father
chapter

and

dreams
the

elspeth
my
my
father
was
brought
up
chiefly
by
his
mother
relations
the
religious
question
was
always
a
difficulty
as
regarded
the
de
vandaleurs
and
i
fancy
extended
to
my
own
case
my
guardians
were
not
my
but
major
buller
and
arkwright
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
my
and
were
roman
catholics
though
not
my
appointed
guardians
they
were
my
nearest
relations
and
when
my
had
held
out
her
little
hand
towards
me
over
the
side
of
the
and
said
you
will
let
the
child
come
to
me
soon
very
soon
major
buller
had
taken
her
hand
in
both
his
and
replied
very
cordially
of
course
my
dear
madam
of
course
whenever
it
is
convenient
to
yourself
and
to
de
vandaleur
and
this
promise
had
stirred
my
heart
with
such
a
flutter
of
happy
expectation
as
i
had
not
felt
since
i
persuaded
my
father
to
promise
that
i
should
dine
with
him
all
alone
like
a
lady
on
that
sad
birthday
on
which
he
died
it
is
perhaps
useless
to
try
and
find
reasons
for
the
fancy
i
took
to
the
duchess
as
aunt
theresa
called
her
since
it
was
allowed
that
she
fascinated
every
one
who
came
near
her
with
the
bright
qualities
which
made
her
admirable
in
herself
she
combined
the
gracious
art
of
putting
other
people
at
ease
with
themselves
and
remembering
how
sore
the
wounds
of
a
child
are
i
think
that
her
kindness
must
have
been
very
skilful
to
make
me
forgive
myself
for
that
folly
of
the
enough
to
forget
myself
in
admiration
of
her
like
most
children
i
was
given
to
hero
and
heroine
worship
i
admired
more
than
one
lady
of
aunt
theresa
acquaintance
and
had
been
fascinated
by
some
others
whom
i
did
not
know
but
had
only
seen
in
church
and
had
longed
for
the
time
when
i
also
should
no
longer
trip
about
in
short
and
simple
skirts
and
tie
up
my
curls
with
a
ribbon
but
should
sweep
grandly
and
languidly
in
to
the
parade
service
bury
half
a
pew
under
the
festoons
and
furbelows
of
my
silk
dress
and
velvet
trimmings
sink
into
a
nest
of
matchless
millinery
for
the
litany
scent
the
air
with
patchouli
as
i
rose
for
the
hymn
examine
the
other
bonnets
through
one
of
those
eyeglasses
which
are
supposed
to
make
it
no
longer
rude
to
stare
and
fan
myself
from
the
fatigues
of
the
service
during
the
sermon
but
even
the
dignity
of
embellished
by
pretty
faces
and
splendid
costumes
did
not
stir
my
imagination
as
it
was
stirred
by
the
sight
of
my
and
by
the
history
of
her
life
it
was
like
seeing
the
princess
of
a
fairy
tale
with
one
very
own
eyes
the
faces
of
the
fine
ladies
i
had
envied
were
a
little
apt
to
be
insipid
in
expression
and
to
pass
from
the
memory
but
my
quick
bright
earnest
face
was
not
easily
to
be
forgotten
i
made
up
my
mind
that
when
i
grew
up
i
would
not
wear
a
large
after
all
nor
a
bonnet
full
of
flowers
nor
a
dress
full
of
flounces
but
a
rather
short
skirt
and
buckled
shoes
and
grey
curls
and
a
big
hat
with
many
bows
and
a
green
satin
lined
with
fur
how
any
one
blessed
with
freedom
of
choice
could
submit
to
be
driven
about
by
a
in
a
big
carriage
as
highly
stuffed
and
uninteresting
as
a
railway
carriage
when
it
was
possible
to
drive
one
self
in
a
sort
of
with
a
dear
white
pony
as
shaggy
as
a
dog
i
could
not
understand
i
well
knew
which
i
should
choose
and
i
thought
so
much
of
it
that
i
remember
dreaming
that
my
had
presented
me
with
a
pony
and
chaise
the
counterpart
of
her
own
the
of
this
acquisition
and
the
pride
of
driving
up
to
the
bullers
door
and
offering
to
take
matilda
for
an
expedition
was
only
marred
by
one
of
those
freaks
which
spoil
the
pleasure
of
so
many
dreams
just
as
matilda
appeared
full
of
gratitude
and
with
a
picnic
luncheon
in
a
basket
i
became
conscious
that
i
was
in
my
and
had
forgotten
to
dress
again
and
again
i
tried
to
go
back
in
my
dream
and
put
on
suitable
clothes
i
never
accomplished
it
and
only
woke
in
the
effort
in
sober
daylight
i
indulged
no
hope
that
vandaleur
would
give
me
a
carriage
and
pony
for
my
very
own
but
i
did
hope
that
i
should
go
out
in
hers
if
ever
i
went
to
stay
with
her
perhaps
sometimes
alone
driving
myself
with
only
the
adolphe
to
open
the
gates
and
deliver
me
from
any
unexpected
difficulties
with
the
reins
but
i
dreamed
many
a
of
the
possible
delights
in
store
for
me
with
my
relatives
and
almost
counted
the
hours
on
the
watch
till
she
should
send
for
me
as
it
happened
however
circumstances
combined
for
some
little
time
to
hinder
me
from
visiting
my
the
little
bullers
and
i
had
the
measles
and
when
we
were
all
convalescent
major
buller
got
two
months
leave
and
we
went
away
for
change
of
air
then
prevailed
in
riflebury
and
we
were
kept
away
even
after
major
buller
returned
to
his
duties
when
we
did
return
before
a
visit
to
the
vandaleurs
could
be
arranged
adolphe
fell
ill
of
scarlet
fever
and
the
fear
of
contagion
postponed
my
visit
for
some
time
i
was
eight
years
old
when
i
went
to
stay
at
the
vine
this
was
the
name
of
the
little
cottage
where
my
lived
so
called
because
of
an
old
vine
which
covered
the
south
wall
on
one
side
of
the
porch
and
crept
over
a
framework
upon
the
roof
i
do
not
now
remember
how
many
pounds
of
grapes
it
had
been
known
to
produce
in
one
season
and
yet
i
ought
not
to
have
forgotten
for
it
was
a
subject
on
which
my
my
adolphe
and
elspeth
constantly
boasted
and
if
they
do
just
ripen
as
the
master
says
they
do
in
france
all
for
the
best
said
elspeth
for
ripe
grapes
would
be
picked
all
along
and
the
house
not
a
penny
the
better
for
them
but
tarts
and
cream
are
just
eating
for
a
king
elspeth
was
general
servant
at
my
her
aunt
mary
had
come
from
scotland
to
serve
miss
victoire
when
she
first
married
as
mary
health
failed
and
she
grew
old
her
young
niece
was
sent
for
to
work
under
her
old
mary
died
with
her
hands
in
my
and
elspeth
reigned
in
her
stead
elspeth
was
an
elderly
woman
when
i
first
made
her
acquaintance
she
had
a
broad
bright
sensible
face
and
a
kindly
smile
that
won
me
to
her
she
wore
frilled
caps
tied
under
her
chin
and
as
to
exchanging
them
for
the
bits
of
things
servants
stick
on
their
heads
at
the
present
time
elspeth
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
abandoning
the
faith
of
her
fathers
she
was
a
strict
but
not
bitter
presbyterian
she
was
not
tall
and
she
was
very
broad
her
apparent
width
being
increased
by
the
very
broad
linen
collars
which
spread
almost
like
a
cape
over
her
ample
shoulders
my
had
an
anecdote
of
me
connected
with
this
which
she
was
fond
of
relating
and
what
do
you
think
of
elspeth
little
one
she
had
said
to
me
on
the
first
evening
of
my
visit
i
think
she
very
big
was
my
reply
certainly
our
good
elspeth
is
as
wide
as
she
is
tall
said
my
laughing
i
wondered
if
this
were
so
and
when
my
gave
me
a
little
in
a
wooden
castle
which
had
taken
my
fancy
among
the
treasures
of
her
the
idea
seized
me
of
measuring
elspeth
for
my
own
satisfaction
on
the
point
but
the
silken
measure
slipped
and
caught
on
the
battlements
of
the
castle
and
i
lost
my
place
in
counting
the
figures
and
at
last
was
fain
to
ask
elspeth
herself
how
tall
are
you
elspeth
please
as
much
as
a
yard
ou
aye
my
dear
said
elspeth
who
was
deeply
engaged
in
darning
a
very
large
hole
in
one
of
my
socks
as
much
as
two
yards
i
inquired
eh
no
my
dearie
said
elspeth
that
wad
be
six
feet
and
i
not
just
that
tall
though
my
father
was
six
feet
and
six
inches
how
broad
are
you
elspeth
please
i
persisted
as
much
as
a
yard
i
thinking
i
will
be
my
dear
said
elspeth
for
it
takes
the
full
width
of
a
coloured
cotton
to
cut
me
a
and
then
it
not
are
you
as
broad
as
two
yards
do
you
think
i
said
drawing
my
ribbon
to
its
full
length
from
the
castle
and
considering
the
question
elspeth
shook
her
head
she
was
biting
the
end
off
a
piece
of
but
i
rightly
concluded
that
she
would
not
confess
to
being
two
yards
wide
please
i
have
measured
elspeth
i
announced
over
the
and
grandpapa
is
quite
right
eh
said
vandaleur
who
had
a
trick
of
requiring
observations
to
be
repeated
to
him
by
his
wife
she
says
that
she
has
measured
elspeth
and
that
you
are
right
said
my
but
about
what
is
grandpapa
right
my
little
one
grandpapa
said
that
elspeth
is
as
wide
as
she
is
tall
i
explained
and
so
she
is
for
i
measured
her
at
least
the
ribbon
would
slip
when
i
measured
her
so
i
asked
her
and
she
a
yard
tall
but
not
as
much
as
two
yards
and
a
yard
wide
but
not
as
much
as
two
yards
and
so
grandpapa
is
right
some
of
the
happiest
hours
i
spent
at
the
vine
were
spent
in
company
i
made
tiny
cakes
and
tarts
of
curious
shapes
when
she
was
busy
and
did
some
on
my
doll
account
when
elspeth
was
my
cravats
elspeth
had
strong
notions
of
paying
respect
where
it
was
due
she
gave
adolphe
a
sharp
lecture
one
day
for
some
lack
of
respect
in
his
manner
to
miss
margery
and
on
the
other
hand
she
taught
me
to
curtsy
at
the
door
where
i
breakfasted
with
and
vandaleur
some
dancing
lessons
that
i
had
had
in
riflebury
helped
me
here
and
elspeth
was
well
satisfied
with
my
performance
i
felt
very
shy
and
awkward
the
first
time
that
i
made
my
morning
curtsy
my
knees
shaking
under
me
and
elspeth
watching
from
the
passage
but
my
and
mother
seemed
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
i
soon
became
quite
used
to
it
if
vandaleur
happened
to
be
standing
in
the
room
he
always
returned
my
curtsy
by
a
low
bow
i
became
very
fond
of
my
he
was
a
tall
handsome
old
man
with
high
shoulders
slightly
bent
by
age
and
also
by
habit
he
wore
a
blue
coat
with
brass
buttons
that
had
been
very
well
made
a
very
long
time
ago
white
trousers
a
light
waistcoat
a
frilled
shirt
and
a
very
stiff
cravat
on
the
wall
of
the
there
hung
a
portrait
of
a
very
young
and
very
handsome
man
with
longish
wavy
hair
features
refined
to
weakness
dreamy
languid
eyes
and
a
coat
the
very
image
of
my
the
picture
hung
near
the
door
and
as
bertrand
vandaleur
passed
in
or
out
i
well
remember
that
he
almost
always
glanced
at
the
sketch
as
people
glance
at
themselves
in
passing
a
mirror
i
was
too
young
then
to
notice
this
as
being
a
proof
that
the
drawing
was
a
portrait
of
himself
but
i
remember
being
much
struck
by
the
likeness
between
the
coat
in
the
picture
and
that
my
wore
and
also
by
the
way
that
the
hair
was
thrown
back
from
the
high
narrow
forehead
just
as
my
grey
hairs
were
combed
away
from
his
brow
children
are
great
admirers
of
beauty
too
especially
i
think
of
an
effeminate
style
of
good
looks
and
are
very
susceptible
to
the
power
of
expression
in
faces
i
had
a
romantic
admiration
for
the
handsome
man
by
the
door
and
his
eyes
haunted
me
about
the
room
i
was
kneeling
on
a
chair
and
examining
the
sketch
one
morning
when
my
came
up
to
me
who
is
it
little
one
said
he
i
looked
at
the
picture
i
looked
at
my
coat
as
his
eyes
gazed
steadily
into
mine
there
was
a
likeness
there
also
but
it
was
the
coat
that
decided
me
i
said
it
is
you
grandpapa
i
think
this
little
incident
just
sealed
our
friendship
i
always
remained
in
high
favour
with
my
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
his
time
in
painting
he
never
had
i
believe
had
any
profession
the
very
small
income
on
which
he
and
his
wife
had
lived
was
their
own
private
fortune
i
often
think
it
must
have
been
a
great
trial
to
a
woman
of
my
energy
that
her
husband
should
have
made
no
effort
to
add
to
their
resources
by
work
of
some
kind
but
then
i
can
not
think
of
any
profession
that
would
have
suited
him
he
was
sadly
wanting
in
general
capacity
though
accomplished
much
above
the
average
and
with
a
fine
knack
in
the
budding
of
roses
i
thought
him
the
grandest
gentleman
that
ever
lived
and
the
pleasantest
of
companions
his
weak
but
lovable
nature
had
strong
sympathy
with
children
i
think
i
ought
to
say
with
a
child
for
he
would
share
the
fancies
and
humours
of
one
child
companion
for
hours
but
was
quite
incapable
of
managing
a
larger
number
as
indeed
he
was
of
any
kind
of
domestic
administration
or
control
vandaleur
was
emphatically
elspeth
mistress
if
she
was
also
her
friend
but
in
the
absence
of
the
mistress
elspeth
ruled
the
master
with
a
rod
of
iron
i
quickly
gained
a
degree
of
power
over
him
myself
i
discovered
that
if
i
maintained
certain
outward
forms
of
respect
and
courtesy
so
as
not
to
shock
my
grandpapa
standard
of
good
manners
i
might
make
almost
any
demands
on
his
patience
and
children
and
pet
animals
make
such
discoveries
very
quickly
and
are
apt
to
use
their
power
somewhat
tyrannically
i
fear
i
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
chapter
thomas
the
cat
my
sketches
adolphe
is
my
friend
my
disturbs
my
rest
i
leave
the
vine
my
had
as
i
said
some
skill
in
painting
he
was
gifted
with
an
intense
sense
of
and
love
for
colour
i
am
sure
he
saw
colours
where
other
people
did
not
what
to
common
eyes
was
a
mass
of
grey
or
green
was
to
him
a
pleasant
combination
of
many
gay
and
delicate
hues
he
distinguished
severally
the
innumerable
bright
threads
in
nature
coat
of
many
colours
and
in
simple
truth
i
think
that
each
was
a
separate
joy
to
him
he
had
a
white
persian
cat
of
an
artistic
temperament
which
followed
him
in
his
walks
dozed
on
the
back
of
his
and
condescended
to
share
his
tea
when
it
reached
a
certain
moderate
temperature
it
never
was
betrayed
into
excitement
except
when
there
was
fish
for
dinner
my
fasts
were
feasts
for
thomas
the
cat
i
can
very
clearly
remember
the
sight
of
my
pacing
slowly
up
and
down
the
tiny
garden
at
the
vine
his
hands
behind
him
and
followed
sedately
by
thomas
now
and
then
he
would
stop
to
gaze
with
infinite
contentment
in
his
eyes
at
the
delicate
mist
behind
the
leafless
trees
which
in
that
spring
sunshine
were
no
doubt
of
much
more
complex
and
beautiful
colour
to
him
than
mere
brown
or
drinking
in
the
blue
of
the
scillas
in
the
border
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
when
he
paused
thomas
would
pause
as
he
feasted
his
eyes
thomas
would
rub
his
head
against
his
master
legs
and
stretch
his
own
when
elspeth
had
cooked
the
fish
and
my
had
made
the
tea
and
arranged
the
flowers
on
the
table
they
would
come
in
together
and
condescend
to
their
breakfasts
with
the
same
air
about
them
both
of
having
no
responsibility
in
life
but
to
find
out
sunny
spots
and
to
enjoy
themselves
my
most
charming
paintings
were
sketches
of
flowers
ordinary
stiff
are
of
all
paintings
the
most
uninteresting
i
think
but
his
were
of
a
very
different
kind
each
sketch
was
a
sort
of
idyll
indeed
he
would
tell
me
stories
of
each
as
he
showed
them
long
as
my
had
lived
he
was
never
a
robust
man
and
elspeth
chief
ideas
on
the
subject
of
his
sketches
bore
reference
to
the
colds
he
had
caught
and
the
illnesses
he
had
induced
by
sitting
in
the
east
winds
or
lying
on
damp
grass
to
do
this
or
that
sketch
that
be
the
one
the
master
did
before
he
was
laid
by
with
the
rheumatics
elspeth
said
when
i
described
one
of
my
favourites
to
her
it
was
a
spring
sketch
my
had
lain
face
downwards
on
the
lawn
to
do
it
this
was
to
bring
his
eyes
on
a
level
with
the
subject
of
his
painting
which
was
this
a
crocus
of
the
exquisite
shades
of
lilac
to
be
seen
in
some
varieties
just
standing
up
in
its
first
beauty
and
freshness
from
its
fringe
of
narrow
leaves
the
portrait
was
not
an
opaque
and
painting
on
smooth
cardboard
but
a
sketch
indefinite
at
the
outer
edges
of
the
whole
subject
on
paper
of
moderate
roughness
the
throat
and
part
of
the
cup
of
the
flower
stood
out
from
some
shadow
at
the
roots
of
a
plant
beyond
a
shadow
of
infinite
gradation
and
quite
without
the
blackness
common
to
patches
of
shade
as
seen
by
untrained
eyes
from
the
level
of
my
view
as
he
lay
in
the
grass
the
border
looked
a
mere
strip
close
behind
it
was
a
hedge
dividing
the
garden
from
a
field
just
by
the
crocus
there
was
a
gap
in
the
hedge
which
in
the
sketch
was
indicated
rather
than
drawn
and
round
the
corner
of
the
bare
thorn
branches
from
the
in
the
field
there
peeped
a
celandine
and
a
daisy
they
were
not
nearly
such
finished
portraits
as
that
of
the
crocus
a
few
telling
strokes
of
colour
made
them
and
gave
them
a
life
and
pertness
that
were
clever
enough
beneath
the
sketch
was
written
la
demoiselle
des
enfants
du
village
la
regardent
my
translated
this
for
me
and
used
to
show
me
how
the
little
peasants
marguerite
and
celandine
were
peeping
in
at
the
pretty
young
lady
in
her
mauve
dress
striped
with
violet
but
every
sketch
had
its
story
and
often
its
moral
not
as
a
rule
a
very
original
one
in
one
a
lovely
study
of
ivy
crept
over
a
rotten
branch
upon
the
ground
a
crimson
toadstool
relieved
the
heavy
green
and
suggested
that
the
year
was
drawing
to
a
close
beneath
it
was
written
charity
thus
said
my
one

up
and
hides
the
defects
of

he
loves
a

of
gaudy
summer
tulips
stood
as
may
be
guessed
for
pride
pride
said
my
is
a
sin
a
mortal
sin
dear
child
moreover
it
is
foolish
and
also
vulgar
the
pride
of
fine
clothes
money
equipages
and
the
like
what
is
called
pride
of
birth
the
dignity
of
an
ancient
name
this
indeed
is
another
thing
it
is
not
petty
not
personal
it
seems
to
me
more
like
patriotism
the
pride
of
country
i
did
my
best
to
describe
to
elspeth
both
the
sketch
and
my
commentary
a
pride
sinful
said
elspeth
decidedly
pride
o
wealth
and
pride
o
birth
not
that
i
for
objecting
to
a
decent
satisfaction
in
a
body
ain
gude
conduct
and
respectability
pride
o
character
anither
thing
and
to
be
respectit
my
gave
me
a
few
paints
and
under
his
directions
i
daubed
away
much
to
my
own
content
when
i
was
struggling
hopelessly
with
the
perspective
of
some
pansies
of
various
colours
for
in
imitation
of
him
i
painted
flowers
he
would
say
never
mind
the
shape
dear
marguerite
get
the
colour
the
colour
my
child
and
he
trained
me
to
a
quickness
in
the
perception
of
colour
certainly
not
common
at
my
age
i
spent
many
pleasant
hours
too
in
the
less
intellectual
society
of
adolphe
he
dug
a
bed
for
me
in
a
bit
of
spare
ground
and
shaped
it
like
a
heart
he
laboured
constantly
at
this
heart
making
it
plump
by
piling
up
the
earth
and
cramming
it
with
plants
of
various
kinds
perennials
much
in
want
of
subdivision
and
often
in
full
bloom
which
he
brought
from
cottage
gardens
of
folk
he
knew
and
watered
copiously
to
sattle
his
real
name
was
not
adolphe
but
thomas
as
this
however
had
created
some
confusion
between
him
and
the
cat
my
had
named
him
afresh
after
a
retainer
of
the
de
vandaleurs
in
days
gone
by
whose
faithful
service
was
a
tradition
in
the
family
i
was
very
happy
at
the
vine
by
day
i
feel
ashamed
now
to
recall
how
miserable
i
was
at
night
and
yet
i
know
i
could
not
help
it
in
old
times
i
had
always
been
accustomed
to
be
watched
to
sleep
by
ayah
after
i
came
to
aunt
theresa
i
slept
in
the
same
room
with
one
or
more
of
the
other
children
at
the
vine
for
the
first
time
i
slept
alone
this
was
not
all
it
was
not
merely
the
being
alone
in
the
dark
which
frightened
me
indeed
a
curious
little
wick
floating
on
a
cup
of
oil
was
lighted
at
night
for
my
benefit
but
it
only
illumined
the
great
source
of
the
terror
which
made
night
hideous
to
me
some
french
refugee
artist
who
had
been
indebted
to
my
for
kindness
had
shown
his
gratitude
by
painting
a
picture
of
the
execution
of
that
duc
de
vandaleur
who
perished
in
the
revolution
my
having
been
the
model
it
was
a
wretched
daub
but
the
subject
was
none
the
less
horrible
for
that
and
the
caricatured
likeness
to
my
did
not
make
it
seem
less
real
or
more
pleasant
that
execution
which
was
never
over
this
ghastly
head
which
never
found
rest
in
the
grave
that
man
who
was
and
yet
was
not
grandpapa
haunted
me
they
were
the
cause
of
certain
horrible
dreams
which
i
can
remember
quite
as
clearly
at
this
day
as
if
i
dreamed
them
last
night
and
which
i
know
i
shall
never
forget
the
dreams
again
associated
themselves
with
the
picture
and
my
fears
grew
instead
of
lessening
as
the
time
went
by
very
late
one
night
elspeth
came
in
and
found
me
awake
and
probably
looking
far
from
happy
i
had
nothing
to
say
for
myself
but
i
burst
into
tears
elspeth
was
tenderness
itself
but
she
got
hold
of
a
wrong
idea
i
was
just
homesick
she
thought
and
needed
to
be
away
home
again
with
bairns
like
myself
i
do
not
know
why
i
never
explained
the
real
reason
of
my
distress
children
are
apt
to
be
reticent
on
such
occasions
i
think
a
panic
seized
upon
the
members
of
the
household
that
they
were
too
old
to
make
a
child
happy
i
was
constantly
assured
that
it
was
very
natural
and
i
had
been
very
good
but
i
was
sent
back
to
riflebury
no
one
knew
how
loth
i
was
to
leave
still
less
that
it
was
to
a
much
older
relative
than
those
at
the
vine
that
i
owed
my
expulsion
to
my
monsieur
le
duc
de
vandaleur
thomas
the
cat
purred
so
loudly
as
i
withdrew
that
i
think
he
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
me
adolphe
alone
was
against
the
verdict
of
the
household
and
i
think
believed
that
i
would
have
preferred
to
remain
i
sure
i
thought
you
was
quite
sattled
miss
he
said
as
he
saw
me
off
and
he
blubbered
like
a
baby
his
transplanted
perennials
were
sattled
by
copious
floods
of
water
perhaps
he
hoped
that
tears
would
settle
me
chapter
xi
matilda
news
our
governess
major
buller
turned
tutor
eleanor
arkwright
the
grief
i
felt
at
leaving
the
vine
was
greatly
forgotten
in
the
warm
welcome
which
awaited
me
on
my
return
to
riflebury
in
a
household
where
gossip
is
a
principal
amusement
the
return
of
any
member
from
a
visit
is
a
matter
for
general
congratulation
till
the
new
budget
is
exhausted
indeed
i
plead
guilty
to
a
liking
to
be
the
first
to
skim
the
news
when
eleanor
or
one
of
the
boys
comes
back
from
a
visit
at
the
present
time
matilda
withdrew
me
from
aunt
theresa
as
soon
as
she
could
i
am
so
glad
to
get
you
back
margery
dear
said
she
and
now
you
must
tell
me
all
your
news
and
i
tell
you
all
mine
and
to
begin
with
what
do
you
think
we
got
a
governess
and
you
and
i
are
to
have
the
little
room
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
all
to
ourselves
matilda
news
was
lengthy
enough
and
interesting
enough
to
make
us
late
for
tea
and
mine
kept
us
awake
for
a
couple
of
hours
after
we
were
fairly
in
our
two
little
iron
bedsteads
in
the
room
that
was
now
our
very
own
that
is
to
say
i
told
what
i
had
to
tell
after
we
came
to
bed
but
my
news
was
so
tame
compared
with
matilda
that
we
soon
returned
to
the
discussion
of
hers
i
tried
to
describe
my
sketches
but
neither
aunt
theresa
in
the
nor
matilda
when
we
retired
for
the
night
seemed
to
feel
any
interest
in
the
subject
and
when
buller
asked
what
sort
of
people
called
at
the
vine
i
felt
that
my
reply
was
like
the
rest
of
my
news
but
dull
matilda
on
the
contrary
was
very
entertaining
she
spoke
enthusiastically
of
miss
perry
the
governess
she
is
so
margery
you
ca
think
when
lessons
are
over
she
takes
me
walks
on
the
esplanade
and
she
calls
me
her
dear
matilda
and
i
take
her
arm
and
she
tells
me
all
about
herself
she
says
she
knows
she
very
romantic
and
she
got
lots
of
secrets
and
she
told
me
several
already
for
she
says
she
has
a
feeling
that
i
can
keep
a
secret
and
so
i
can
but
telling
you
not
telling
you
know
because
she
sure
to
tell
you
herself
only
you
better
wait
till
she
does
before
you
say
anything
for
fear
she
should
be
vexed
of
course
i
promised
to
do
so
and
craned
my
neck
out
of
bed
to
catch
matilda
interesting
but
whispered
revelations
matilda
herself
was
only
partially
in
miss
perry
confidence
and
i
looked
anxiously
forward
to
the
time
when
she
would
admit
me
also
to
her
secrets
though
i
feared
she
might
consider
me
too
young
my
fears
were
groundless
as
i
found
miss
perry
was
fond
of
talking
about
herself
and
a
suitable
audience
was
quite
a
secondary
consideration
with
her
she
was
a
of
minchin
who
had
persuaded
aunt
theresa
to
take
her
for
our
governess
she
was
quite
unfit
for
the
position
and
did
no
little
harm
to
us
in
her
brief
reign
but
i
do
not
think
that
our
interests
had
entered
in
the
least
into
minchin
calculations
in
the
matter
she
had
taken
miss
perry
up
and
to
get
miss
perry
a
comfortable
home
was
her
sole
object
to
do
our
new
governess
justice
she
did
her
best
to
impart
her
own
superficial
acquirements
to
us
we
plodded
regularly
through
french
exercises
which
she
corrected
by
a
key
and
she
kept
us
at
work
for
a
given
number
of
hours
during
the
day
tatting
by
our
sides
as
we
practised
our
scales
or
roasting
her
petticoats
over
the
fire
whilst
matilda
and
i
read
markham
or
mrs
trimmer
aloud
by
turns
to
but
when
lessons
were
over
miss
perry
was
quite
as
glad
as
we
were
and
the
subjects
of
our
studies
had
as
little
to
do
with
our
holiday
hours
as
a
sunday
sermon
with
the
rest
of
the
week
she
was
a
great
and
i
think
a
good
many
of
the
things
she
told
us
of
as
having
happened
to
herself
had
their
real
origin
in
the
riflebury
circulating
library
for
she
was
one
of
those
strange
characters
who
indulge
in
egotism
and
exaggeration
till
they
seem
positively
to
lose
the
sense
of
what
is
fact
and
what
is
fiction
she
filled
our
poor
empty
little
heads
with
a
great
deal
of
folly
and
it
was
well
for
us
that
her
reign
was
not
a
long
one
she
was
much
attached
to
the
fireside
she
could
not
sit
too
close
to
it
or
roast
herself
too
thoroughly
for
her
own
satisfaction
i
sometimes
wondered
if
the
bony
woman
who
kept
the
library
ever
complained
of
the
curled
condition
of
the
backs
of
the
books
miss
perry
held
between
her
eyes
and
the
hot
coals
for
so
many
hours
in
this
highly
heated
state
our
governess
was
of
course
sensitive
to
the
smallest
inlet
of
cooler
air
and
draughts
were
accordingly
her
abhorrence
how
we
contrived
to
distinguish
a
verb
from
a
noun
or
committed
anything
whatever
to
memory
in
the
and
stuffy
atmosphere
of
the
little
room
which
was
sacred
to
our
studies
i
do
not
know
at
a
certain
degree
of
the
thermometer
miss
perry
face
rises
before
me
and
makes
my
brain
spin
even
now
this
was
no
doubt
one
cause
of
the
very
severe
headaches
to
which
matilda
became
subject
about
this
time
though
now
i
look
back
i
do
not
think
she
had
been
quite
strong
since
we
all
had
the
measles
they
were
apt
to
end
in
a
fainting
condition
from
which
she
recovered
by
lying
on
the
floor
then
if
miss
perry
happened
to
be
in
good
humour
she
would
excuse
matilda
from
further
lessons
invariably
adding
in
her
mystery
voice
but
not
a
word
to
your
mamma
it
was
the
most
unjustifiable
use
she
made
of
influence
she
gained
over
us
especially
over
poor
matilda
who
was
very
fond
of
her
and
believed
in
her
that
she
magnified
her
own
favours
at
the
expense
of
major
buller
and
my
aunt
for
some
time
they
had
no
doubts
as
to
the
wisdom
of
minchin
choice
miss
perry
was
clever
enough
not
to
display
her
romantic
side
to
buller
she
amused
her
too
with
riflebury
gossip
in
which
she
was
an
adept
she
knew
equally
well
how
far
she
might
venture
with
the
major
and
the
with
which
she
threw
needlework
over
a
novel
when
aunt
theresa
came
into
the
was
not
more
skilful
than
the
way
in
which
she
turned
the
tail
of
a
bit
of
scandal
into
a
remark
upon
the
weather
as
uncle
buller
opened
the
door
but
miss
perry
was
not
skilful
enough
to
win
the
major
lasting
favour
he
was
always
slow
to
interfere
in
domestic
matters
but
he
was
not
unobservant
i
sure
you
see
a
great
deal
more
than
one
would
think
edward
aunt
theresa
would
say
although
you
are
so
wrapt
up
in
insects
and
things
the
insects
do
get
into
my
eyes
my
dear
said
major
buller
and
hear
too
buller
continued
was
saying
only
the
other
day
that
you
often
seem
to
hear
of
things
before
other
people
though
you
do
talk
so
little
it
is
perhaps
because
i
am
not
always
talking
that
i
do
hear
but
is
not
likely
to
think
of
that
said
the
major
rather
severely
he
was
neither
blind
nor
deaf
in
reference
to
miss
perry
and
she
was
dismissed
aunt
theresa
rather
dreaded
minchin
indignation
in
the
matter
i
believe
but
needlessly
for
miss
perry
and
minchin
quarrelled
about
this
time
and
minchin
had
then
so
much
information
to
miss
perry
disadvantage
at
her
fingers
ends
that
it
seemed
wonderful
that
she
should
ever
have
recommended
her
for
some
little
time
our
education
progressed
in
a
very
desultory
fashion
major
buller
became
perversely
prejudiced
against
governesses
and
for
a
short
time
undertook
to
carry
on
our
english
lessons
himself
he
made
sums
amusing
and
geography
lessons
as
good
as
stories
though
the
latter
so
often
led
by
very
interesting
channels
to
his
dearly
beloved
insects
that
buller
accused
him
of
making
our
lessons
an
excuse
for
getting
out
his
collection
with
grammar
we
were
less
successful
major
buller
was
so
good
a
teacher
that
he
brought
out
what
intelligence
we
possessed
and
led
us
constantly
to
ask
questions
about
anything
we
failed
to
understand
in
arithmetic
this
led
to
his
helping
us
over
our
difficulties
in
geography
it
led
sooner
or
later
to
the
collection
but
in
english
grammar
it
led
to
and
confusion
and
finally
to
the
major
throwing
the
book
across
the
room
and
refusing
to
pursue
that
part
of
our
education
any
further
i
never
learnt
english
grammar
said
the
major
and
it
quite
evident
that
i
ca
teach
it
if
do
know
grammar
papa
then
need
said
matilda
promptly
and
being
neat
of
disposition
she
picked
up
the
book
and
proceeded
to
put
it
away
i
never
said
that
i
did
know
grammar
said
the
major
i
fancy
i
can
speak
and
write
grammatically
but
what
i
know
i
got
from
the
latin
grammar
and
upon
my
soul
added
uncle
buller
pulling
at
his
heavy
moustache
i
do
know
why
you
should
do
the
same
the
idea
of
learning
latin
pleased
us
greatly
and
major
buller
who
had
been
at
charterhouse
in
his
boyhood
bought
a
copy
of
and
we
set
to
work
and
either
because
the
rules
of
the
latin
grammar
bore
explanation
better
than
the
english
ones
or
because
major
buller
was
better
able
to
explain
them
we
had
no
further
difficulties
we
were
very
proud
of
doing
lessons
in
these
circumstances
and
boasted
of
our
latin
i
remember
to
the
little
quentins
when
we
met
them
at
the
the
quentins
were
slender
ladylike
girls
much
alike
and
rendered
more
so
by
an
exact
similarity
of
costume
their
governess
was
a
very
charming
and
talented
woman
and
when
quentin
proposed
that
matilda
and
i
should
share
her
french
lessons
under
miss
airlie
major
buller
and
aunt
theresa
thankfully
accepted
the
offer
i
think
that
our
short
association
with
this
excellent
lady
went
far
to
cure
us
of
the
silly
fancies
and
tricks
of
vulgar
gossip
which
we
had
gleaned
from
miss
perry
so
matters
went
on
for
some
months
much
to
matilda
and
my
satisfaction
when
a
letter
from
my
other
guardian
changed
our
plans
once
more
arkwright
only
daughter
was
going
to
school
he
wrote
to
ask
the
bullers
to
let
her
break
the
journey
by
spending
a
night
at
their
house
it
was
a
long
journey
for
she
was
coming
from
the
north
they
live
in
yorkshire
said
major
buller
much
as
one
might
speak
of
living
in
central
africa
matilda
and
i
looked
forward
with
great
interest
to
miss
arrival
her
name
we
learnt
was
eleanor
and
she
was
nearly
a
year
older
than
maria
she
be
friend
i
suppose
i
said
a
little
enviously
in
reference
to
her
age
of
course
said
matilda
with
dignity
but
you
can
be
with
us
a
good
deal
she
was
kind
enough
to
add
i
remember
quite
well
how
disappointed
i
felt
that
i
should
have
so
little
title
to
share
the
newcomer
friendship
if
she
had
only
been
ten
years
old
and
so
come
between
us
i
thought
she
would
have
been
as
much
mine
as
matilda
i
little
thought
then
what
manner
of
friends
we
were
to
be
in
spite
of
the
five
years
difference
in
age
indeed
both
matilda
and
i
were
destined
to
see
more
of
her
than
we
expected
aunt
theresa
and
major
buller
came
to
a
sudden
resolution
to
send
us
also
to
the
school
where
she
was
going
though
we
did
not
hear
of
this
at
first
long
afterwards
when
we
were
together
eleanor
asked
me
if
i
could
remember
my
first
impression
of
her
for
our
affection
sake
i
wish
it
had
been
a
picturesque
one
but
truth
obliges
me
to
confess
that
when
our
visitor
did
at
last
arrive
matilda
and
i
were
chiefly
struck
by
the
fact
that
she
wore
thick
boots
and
did
not
wear
crinoline
and
yet
looking
back
i
have
a
very
clear
picture
of
her
in
my
mind
standing
in
the
passage
by
her
box
a
very
rough
one
very
strongly
corded
and
addressed
in
the
clearest
of
handwriting
purse
in
hand
and
paying
the
cabman
with
perfect
an
upright
quite
ladylike
but
rather
little
figure
somewhat
quaint
from
the
simplicity
of
her
dress
she
had
a
rather
quaint
face
too
with
a
nose
slightly
turned
up
a
prominent
forehead
a
charming
mouth
and
most
beautiful
dark
eyes
her
hair
was
rolled
under
and
tied
at
the
top
of
her
head
and
it
had
an
odd
tendency
to
go
astray
about
the
parting
this
was
perhaps
partly
from
a
trick
she
seemed
to
have
of
doing
her
hair
away
from
the
she
stood
to
do
it
and
also
on
one
leg
to
put
on
her
shoes
and
stockings
which
amused
us
but
she
was
always
on
her
feet
and
seemed
unhappy
if
she
sat
idle
we
took
her
for
a
walk
the
morning
after
her
arrival
and
walked
faster
than
we
had
ever
walked
before
to
keep
pace
with
our
new
friend
who
strode
along
in
her
thick
boots
and
undistended
skirts
with
a
step
like
that
of
a
kilted
highlander
when
we
came
into
the
town
however
she
was
quite
willing
to
pause
before
the
which
gave
her
much
entertainment
i
afraid
i
should
always
be
looking
in
at
the
windows
if
i
lived
in
a
town
she
said
there
are
such
pretty
things
eleanor
laughs
when
i
remind
her
of
that
walk
and
how
we
stood
still
by
every
chemist
door
because
she
liked
the
smell
when
anything
interested
her
she
stopped
but
at
other
times
she
walked
as
if
she
were
on
the
road
to
some
given
place
and
determined
to
be
there
in
good
time
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
just
to
say
that
she
walked
as
if
walking
were
a
pleasure
to
her
it
was
walking
not
strolling
when
she
was
out
alone
i
know
that
she
constantly
ran
when
other
people
would
have
walked
it
is
a
habit
i
think
i
have
seen
scotch
and
yorkshire
ladies
run
as
lightly
as
children
it
was
not
the
fashionable
time
of
day
so
that
we
could
not
during
that
walk
show
eleanor
the
chief
characters
of
riflebury
but
just
as
we
were
leaving
high
street
she
stopped
and
asked
who
is
that
lady
the
one
in
the
mauve
silk
said
matilda
that
is
one
of
the
cavalry
ladies
all
the
cavalry
ladies
dress
grandly
it
was
a
perowne
she
was
sailing
languidly
down
the
other
side
of
the
street
in
a
very
large
crinoline
and
a
very
long
dress
of
pale
silk
which
floated
after
her
along
the
dirty
pavement
much
i
remember
to
my
admiration
above
this
was
some
thing
with
a
good
deal
of
lace
about
it
which
was
crowned
by
a
fragile
and
flowery
bonnet
and
such
a
tuft
of
white
lace
at
the
end
of
a
white
stick
as
just
sheltered
her
nose
which
was
aquiline
from
the
sunshine
she
was
prettily
dressed
for
an
open
carriage
a
or
a
wedding
breakfast
for
walking
through
the
streets
of
a
small
dirty
town
to
change
her
own
books
at
the
library
her
costume
was
ludicrously
out
of
place
though
at
the
time
i
thought
it
enviably
grand
the
way
in
which
a
rich
skirt
that
would
not
wash
and
would
undoubtedly
be
worn
again
trailed
through
dust
and
and
greengrocers
refuse
and
general
was
offensive
to
cleanliness
alone
is
she
ill
eleanor
asked
no
said
matilda
i
do
think
so
why
she
walks
so
slowly
said
eleanor
gazing
anxiously
at
perowne
out
of
her
dark
eyes
and
she
is
so
white
in
the
face
oh
my
dear
said
matilda
laughing
that
puff
puff
and
a
white
veil
it
to
make
her
look
young
i
heard
minchin
tell
mamma
that
she
knew
she
was
at
least
but
she
dresses
splendidly
if
you
stay
over
sunday
you
see
her
close
for
she
sits
in
front
of
us
in
church
and
she
has
such
a
splendid
big
with
gold
tops
and
such
a
lovely
tiny
little
bound
in
blue
velvet
and
a
watch
no
bigger
than
a
shilling
with
a
monogram
on
the
back
she
took
it
out
several
times
in
the
sermon
last
sunday
so
i
saw
it
but
her
hair
funny
it
a
beautiful
colour
said
eleanor
only
it
looks
different
in
front
but
i
suppose
that
the
veil
no
it
is
said
matilda
that
the
new
colour
for
hair
you
know
it
done
by
stuff
you
put
on
but
miss
perry
said
the
worst
was
it
did
always
come
out
the
same
all
over
lots
of
ladies
use
it
how
horrid
said
eleanor
but
what
makes
her
walk
so
slow
well
i
do
know
said
matilda
why
should
she
walk
quick
eleanor
seemed
struck
by
this
reply
and
after
a
few
minutes
pause
said
very
gently
with
a
slight
blush
on
her
cheeks
i
afraid
i
have
been
walking
too
fast
for
you
i
used
to
walking
with
boys
we
earnestly
assured
her
that
this
was
not
the
case
and
that
it
was
much
better
fun
to
walk
with
her
than
with
miss
perry
who
used
to
dawdle
so
that
we
were
often
thoroughly
chilled
in
the
afternoon
we
took
her
to
the
esplanade
when
matilda
from
her
knowledge
of
the
people
took
the
lead
in
the
conversation
i
was
proud
to
walk
on
the
other
side
of
our
new
friend
with
my
best
doll
in
my
arms
aunt
theresa
came
with
us
but
she
soon
sat
down
to
chat
to
a
friend
and
we
three
strolled
up
and
down
together
i
remember
a
pretty
bit
of
trimming
on
eleanor
hat
being
blown
by
the
wind
against
her
face
on
which
she
quietly
seized
it
and
stuffed
it
securely
into
the
band
oh
my
dear
said
matilda
in
the
emphatic
tone
in
which
aunt
theresa
lady
visitors
were
wont
to
exclaim
about
nothing
in
particular
do
do
that
it
looks
so
pretty
and
you
crushing
it
it
got
in
my
eyes
said
eleanor
briefly
i
hate
tags
we
went
home
before
aunt
theresa
but
as
we
stood
near
the
door
eleanor
lingered
and
looked
wistfully
up
the
road
which
ran
over
a
slight
hill
towards
the
open
country
would
you
like
to
stay
out
a
little
longer
we
politely
asked
i
should
rather
like
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
hill
said
eleanor
do
you
think
flat
ground
tires
one
shall
we
race
up
she
added
we
willingly
agreed
i
had
a
few
yards
start
of
eleanor
and
matilda
rather
less
and
away
we
went
but
we
were
little
used
to
running
and
hoops
and
thin
boots
were
not
in
our
favour
eleanor
beat
us
of
course
she
seemed
in
no
way
struck
by
the
view
from
the
top
indeed
it
was
not
particularly
pretty
it
very
flat
about
here
she
said
there
are
no
big
hills
you
can
get
to
the
top
of
i
suppose
we
confessed
that
there
were
not
and
there
being
nothing
more
to
do
we
ran
down
again
and
went
indoors
eleanor
dressed
for
the
evening
in
her
usual
peripatetic
way
and
armed
with
a
piece
of
grey
knitting
followed
us
her
superabundant
energy
did
not
seem
to
find
vent
in
conversation
we
were
confidential
enough
now
to
tell
each
other
of
our
homes
and
she
had
sat
so
long
demurely
silent
that
matilda
ventured
upon
the
inquiry
do
you
talk
much
at
your
home
oh
yes
said
eleanor
at
least
when
we
anything
to
say
and
i
am
sure
no
irony
was
intended
in
the
reply
what
are
you
knitting
my
dear
said
aunt
theresa
a
pair
of
socks
for
my
brother
jack
was
the
answer
i
sure
you
dreadfully
industrious
said
buller
a
little
later
she
begged
eleanor
to
put
it
away
you
tire
your
eyes
my
dear
i
sure
pray
rest
a
little
and
chat
to
us
i
do
look
at
my
knitting
said
eleanor
but
she
put
it
away
and
then
sat
looking
rather
red
in
the
face
and
somewhat
encumbered
with
her
empty
hands
which
were
red
too
i
think
uncle
buller
noticed
this
for
he
told
us
to
get
the
big
and
show
it
to
miss
arkwright
eleanor
got
cool
again
over
the
book
but
she
said
little
till
pausing
before
a
small
print
in
a
sheet
full
of
rather
coarse
coloured
caricatures
cuttings
from
illustrated
papers
and
books
lithographs
and
original
sketches
fitted
into
a
close
patchwork
she
gave
a
sort
of
cry
my
dear
what
is
it
cried
matilda
effusively
i
think
said
eleanor
looking
for
information
to
aunt
theresa
i
think
it
a
real
rembrandt
is
it
a
real
what
my
dear
said
buller
one
of
rembrandt
etchings
said
eleanor
and
of
course
i
know
but
i
think
it
must
be
an
original
it
so
beautifully
done
and
my
mother
has
a
copy
of
this
one
we
know
ours
is
a
copy
and
i
think
this
must
be
an
original
because
all
the
things
are
turned
the
other
way
and
it
very
old
and
it
beautifully
done
eleanor
repeated
with
her
face
over
the
little
black
print
major
buller
came
across
the
room
and
sat
down
by
her
you
are
fond
of
drawing
he
said
very
said
eleanor
and
she
threw
a
good
deal
of
eloquence
into
the
one
word
the
major
and
she
forthwith
plunged
into
a
discussion
of
drawing
etching
it
appeared
that
arkwright
etched
on
copper
and
had
a
good
collection
of
old
etchings
with
which
eleanor
was
familiar
it
also
transpired
that
she
was
a
naturalist
which
led
by
easy
stages
to
a
promise
from
the
major
to
show
eleanor
his
insects
they
talked
till
bedtime
and
when
aunt
theresa
bade
us
she
said
i
glad
you
found
your
voice
my
dear
and
she
added
laughing
but
whenever
papa
talks
to
anybody
it
always
ends
in
the
collection
chapter
xii
poor
matilda
the
awkward
age
buller
takes
counsel
with
her
friends
the
milliner
and
mantuamaker
medical
advice
the
major
decides
it
was
not
because
major
buller
high
opinion
of
miss
airlie
was
in
any
way
lowered
that
he
decided
to
send
us
to
school
in
fact
it
was
only
under
long
and
heavy
pressure
from
circumstances
as
well
as
from
aunt
theresa
that
he
gave
his
consent
to
a
plan
which
never
quite
met
with
his
approval
several
things
at
this
time
seemed
to
conspire
to
effect
it
the
quentins
were
going
on
long
leave
and
miss
airlie
would
go
with
them
this
was
a
heavy
blow
then
we
heard
of
this
school
after
miss
airlie
had
left
riflebury
a
fact
so
opportune
as
to
be
so
aunt
theresa
said
quite
providential
if
we
were
to
go
to
school
sending
us
to
this
one
would
save
the
trouble
of
making
personal
inquiries
and
perhaps
a
less
wise
selection
for
major
buller
had
confidence
in
arkwright
good
judgment
the
ladies
to
whose
care
his
daughter
was
confided
were
probably
fit
to
teach
us
it
would
save
a
great
deal
of
trouble
my
guardian
confessed
and
it
must
also
be
confessed
that
major
buller
was
glad
to
avoid
trouble
when
he
could
conscientiously
do
so
i
think
it
was
his
warm
approval
of
eleanor
which
finally
clinched
the
question
he
thought
that
she
would
be
a
good
companion
for
poor
matilda
why
i
speak
of
her
as
poor
matilda
demands
some
explanation
before
i
attempt
to
give
it
i
must
say
that
there
is
one
respect
in
which
our
biographies
must
always
be
less
satisfactory
than
a
story
that
one
might
invent
when
you
are
putting
down
true
things
about
yourself
and
your
friends
you
can
not
divide
people
neatly
into
the
good
and
the
bad
the
injurers
and
the
injured
as
you
can
if
you
are
writing
a
tale
out
of
your
head
the
story
seems
more
complete
when
you
are
able
either
to
lay
the
blame
of
the
melancholy
events
on
the
shoulders
of
some
unworthy
character
or
to
show
that
they
were
the
natural
punishment
of
the
sufferer
own
misconduct
but
in
thinking
of
matilda
and
aunt
theresa
and
major
buller
or
even
of
the
doctor
and
buller
lady
friends
this
is
not
possible
the
morbid
condition
of
body
and
mind
into
which
matilda
fell
for
some
time
was
no
light
misfortune
either
as
regards
her
sufferings
or
the
discomfort
it
produced
in
the
household
and
i
am
afraid
she
was
both
mismanaged
and
in
fault
herself
it
is
safe
at
any
rate
to
take
the
blame
for
one
own
share
and
i
have
often
thought
with
bitterness
of
spirit
that
child
as
i
was
i
might
have
been
both
forbearing
and
helpful
to
matilda
at
a
time
when
her
temper
was
very
much
tried
by
and
untoward
circumstances
we
had
a
good
many
squabbles
about
this
period
i
piqued
myself
upon
generally
being
in
the
right
and
i
did
not
think
then
as
i
do
now
that
it
is
possible
to
be
most
in
the
right
in
a
quarrel
and
at
the
same
time
not
least
to
blame
for
it
matilda
certainly
did
by
degrees
become
very
irritable
moody
and
perverse
and
her
perversity
developed
itself
in
ways
which
puzzled
poor
aunt
theresa
she
became
silent
and
unsociable
she
displayed
a
particular
dislike
to
the
privileges
of
being
in
the
with
company
and
of
accompanying
aunt
theresa
when
she
paid
her
afternoon
calls
she
looked
very
ill
and
stoutly
denied
that
she
was
so
she
highly
resented
solicitude
on
the
subject
of
her
health
fought
obstinately
over
every
bottle
of
medicine
and
was
positively
rude
to
the
doctors
for
her
unsociability
i
think
miss
perry
evil
influence
was
partly
to
blame
poor
matilda
clung
to
her
belief
in
our
late
governess
when
she
was
no
more
to
us
than
a
text
upon
which
aunt
theresa
and
her
friends
preached
to
each
other
against
governesses
in
general
and
the
governesses
each
had
suffered
from
in
particular
our
lessons
with
major
buller
and
the
influence
of
miss
airlie
good
breeding
and
straightforward
kindness
gave
a
healthier
turn
to
our
tastes
but
when
miss
airlie
went
away
and
major
buller
proclaimed
a
three
weeks
holiday
from
the
latin
grammar
and
we
were
left
to
ourselves
matilda
felt
the
want
of
the
flattery
the
patronage
and
the
small
excitements
and
mysteries
about
nothing
to
which
miss
perry
had
accustomed
her
i
blush
to
think
that
my
companionship
was
less
comfort
to
her
than
it
ought
to
have
been
as
to
aunt
theresa
she
was
always
too
busy
to
give
full
attention
to
anything
and
this
does
not
invite
confidence
another
reason
i
am
sure
for
matilda
dislike
to
appearing
in
company
was
a
painful
sense
of
her
personal
appearance
and
as
she
had
heard
aunt
theresa
and
her
friends
discuss
approve
and
condemn
their
friends
by
the
standard
of
appearances
alone
ever
since
she
was
old
enough
to
overhear
company
conversation
i
hardly
think
she
was
much
to
blame
on
this
point
matilda
was
emphatically
at
what
is
called
an
awkward
age
an
age
more
awkward
with
some
girls
than
with
others
i
wish
ladies
who
mean
to
be
kind
to
their
friends
daughters
would
try
to
remember
the
awkwardness
of
it
and
not
increase
a
naturally
uncomfortable
by
personal
remarks
which
might
disturb
the
composure
of
older
prettier
and
people
it
is
bad
enough
to
be
quite
well
aware
that
the
size
of
one
hands
and
feet
prematurely
foreshadow
the
future
growth
of
one
figure
that
these
are
the
more
prominent
because
the
simple
dresses
of
the
unintroduced
young
lady
seem
to
be
perpetually
receding
from
one
above
and
shrinking
towards
the
calves
of
one
legs
below
from
those
thin
ankles
on
which
one
is
impelled
to
stand
by
turns
like
a
sleeping
stork
through
some
mysterious
instinct
of
relieving
the
weak
and
overgrown
spine
this
i
say
is
mortifying
enough
and
if
modesty
and
good
breeding
carry
us
cheerfully
through
a
not
unfelt
contrast
with
the
assured
manners
and
flowing
draperies
of
mamma
lady
friends
in
the
they
might
spare
us
the
announcement
of
what
it
hardly
needs
gold
eyeglasses
to
discover
that
we
really
grow
every
day
blushes
come
heavily
enough
to
hands
and
cheeks
when
to
the
shyness
of
youth
are
added
the
glows
and
chills
of
imperfect
circulation
it
does
not
need
the
stare
of
strangers
nor
the
apologies
of
mamma
to
stain
our
doubtful
complexions
with
a
deeper
red
all
girls
are
not
awkward
at
the
awkward
age
i
speak
most
disinterestedly
on
matilda
behalf
for
i
never
went
through
this
phase
myself
it
is
perhaps
because
i
am
small
that
i
can
never
remember
my
hands
or
any
other
part
of
me
feeling
in
my
way
and
my
clothes
of
whatever
length
breadth
or
fashion
always
had
a
happy
knack
of
becoming
one
with
me
in
such
wise
that
i
could
comfortably
forget
them
the
quentin
girls
were
nearer
to
matilda
age
than
i
but
they
too
were
very
happy
and
looked
very
nice
in
the
stage
of
girlhood
i
am
sure
that
they
much
preferred
the
company
of
their
young
brothers
to
the
company
of
the
but
they
did
what
they
were
told
to
do
and
seemed
happy
in
doing
it
they
had
however
several
advantages
over
matilda
by
judicious
care
for
they
were
not
naturally
robust
they
were
kept
in
good
health
they
kept
a
great
many
pets
and
they
always
seemed
to
have
plenty
to
do
which
perhaps
kept
them
from
worrying
about
themselves
adelaide
for
instance
did
all
the
flowers
for
the
and
quentin
said
she
could
not
do
them
so
well
herself
they
had
a
very
small
garden
to
pick
from
but
adelaide
used
lots
of
and
grass
and
ferns
she
often
let
me
help
her
to
fill
the
china
jars
and
she
was
the
only
person
who
ever
seemed
to
like
hearing
about
grandpapa
paintings
they
all
did
something
in
the
house
but
i
believe
that
their
greatest
advantage
over
poor
matilda
was
that
they
had
not
been
accustomed
to
hear
dress
and
appearance
talked
about
as
matters
of
the
first
importance
so
that
whatever
defects
they
felt
conscious
of
in
either
did
not
weigh
too
heavily
on
their
minds
on
poor
matilda
they
weighed
heavily
indeed
and
she
was
not
only
troubled
by
that
consciousness
of
being
plain
by
which
i
think
quite
as
many
girls
are
affected
as
by
the
vanity
of
being
pretty
and
which
has
received
far
less
attention
from
moralists
she
was
also
tormented
by
certain
purely
nervous
fancies
of
her
face
being
swollen
her
eyes
squinting
and
her
throat
choking
when
people
looked
at
her
which
were
due
to
unhappily
the
which
was
a
good
excuse
for
unwillingness
to
play
pretty
in
the
was
the
subject
on
which
she
was
more
perverse
than
any
other
it
was
a
great
pity
that
she
was
not
frank
and
confiding
with
her
mother
the
detestable
trick
of
small
concealments
which
miss
perry
had
taught
us
was
partly
answerable
for
this
but
the
fault
was
not
entirely
matilda
aunt
theresa
had
not
time
to
attend
to
her
what
attention
she
did
give
however
made
her
so
anxious
on
the
subject
that
she
took
counsel
with
every
lady
of
her
acquaintance
and
the
more
she
talked
about
poor
matilda
condition
the
less
leisure
she
had
to
think
about
it
it
may
be
more
mind
than
body
i
afraid
said
aunt
theresa
one
afternoon
on
our
return
from
some
visiting
in
which
matilda
had
refused
to
share
minchin
says
she
knew
a
girl
who
went
out
of
her
senses
when
she
was
only
two
years
older
than
matilda
and
it
began
with
her
refusing
to
go
anywhere
or
see
any
one
major
buller
turned
round
on
his
chair
with
an
anxious
face
and
a
beetle
transfixed
by
a
needle
in
his
hand
it
was
a
very
shocking
thing
continued
aunt
theresa
taking
off
her
bonnet
for
she
had
a
in
hanwell
and
her
grandfather
cut
his
throat
i
suppose
it
was
in
the
family
major
buller
turned
back
again
and
pinned
the
beetle
by
its
proper
label
i
suppose
it
was
said
he
dryly
but
as
there
is
no
insanity
in
my
family
or
in
yours
that
i
aware
of
minchin
case
is
not
much
to
the
point
wo
believe
she
ill
sighed
aunt
theresa
thinks
it
all
temper
she
says
her
own
temper
was
unbearable
till
she
had
it
knocked
out
of
her
at
school
matilda
temper
was
good
enough
till
lately
growled
the
major
she
says
brother
who
is
the
medical
officer
of
a
lunatic
asylum
somewhere
in
tipperary
continued
aunt
theresa
declares
all
mad
women
go
out
of
their
minds
through
written
a
book
about
it
heaven
defend
me
mind
and
body
from
the
theories
of
that
astute
practitioner
said
uncle
buller
piously
it
all
very
well
making
fun
of
it
but
everybody
tells
one
that
girls
are
more
trouble
than
any
number
of
boys
i
sure
i
do
remember
giving
my
mother
any
particular
trouble
when
i
was
matilda
age
but
the
stories
i
heard
are
enough
to
make
one
hair
stand
on
end
minchin
knew
another
girl
who
lost
all
her
appetite
just
like
matilda
and
she
had
a
very
sulky
temper
too
and
at
last
they
found
out
she
used
to
eat
she
was
a
creole
or
something
of
that
sort
i
believe
but
they
could
stop
her
the
minchins
knew
her
when
they
were
in
the
west
indies
when
he
was
in
the
or
at
least
it
was
there
they
heard
about
her
the
houses
swarmed
with
a
most
useful
young
lady
said
uncle
buller
does
matilda
dine
on
our
native
beetles
my
dear
she
has
touched
my
humble
collection
oh
if
you
make
fun
of
everything
aunt
theresa
began
but
at
this
moment
john
was
announced
after
the
customary
civilities
aunt
theresa
soon
began
to
talk
of
poor
matilda
and
john
entered
warmly
into
the
subject
to
do
the
ladies
of
the
regiment
justice
they
sympathized
freely
with
each
other
domestic
troubles
and
indeed
it
was
not
for
lack
of
taking
counsel
that
any
of
them
had
any
domestic
troubles
at
all
girls
are
a
good
deal
more
difficult
to
manage
than
boys
i
afraid
sighed
aunt
theresa
repeating
women
are
creatures
at
any
age
said
john
to
the
major
opening
her
brown
eyes
in
the
way
she
always
does
when
she
is
talking
to
a
gentleman
i
always
to
have
been
a
man
eleanor
says
she
hates
to
hear
girls
say
they
wish
they
were
boys
if
they
do
wish
it
i
do
not
myself
see
why
they
should
not
say
so
but
one
thing
has
always
struck
me
as
very
odd
if
you
meet
a
woman
who
is
incomparably
silly
who
does
not
know
an
art
or
a
trade
by
which
she
could
keep
herself
from
starvation
who
could
not
manage
the
of
a
village
shop
who
is
unpunctual
unreasoning
and
in
every
respect
uneducated
a
woman
in
short
who
has
one
would
think
daily
reason
to
be
thankful
that
her
necessities
are
supplied
by
other
people
she
is
pretty
sure
to
be
always
regretting
that
she
is
not
a
man
another
trick
that
some
silly
ladies
have
me
as
we
say
in
yorkshire
far
more
than
this
odd
ambition
for
responsibilities
one
is
quite
incompetent
to
assume
john
had
it
and
as
it
was
generally
displayed
for
the
benefit
of
gentlemen
who
seem
as
a
rule
to
be
very
susceptible
to
flattery
i
suppose
it
is
more
a
kind
of
pretty
talk
than
the
expression
of
deliberate
opinions
it
consists
of
contrasting
girls
with
boys
and
women
with
men
to
the
disparagement
of
the
former
especially
in
matters
over
which
circumstances
and
natural
disposition
are
commonly
supposed
to
give
them
some
advantage
i
remember
hearing
a
fat
girl
at
one
of
aunt
say
with
all
the
impressiveness
of
full
conviction
girls
are
far
more
cruel
than
boys
really
you
know
women
are
more
cruel
than
men
oh
i
they
are
and
the
idea
filled
me
not
less
with
amazement
than
with
horror
this
very
young
lady
had
been
most
to
us
she
had
the
reputation
of
being
an
unselfish
and
elder
sister
i
do
not
think
she
would
have
hurt
a
fly
why
she
said
this
i
can
not
imagine
unless
it
was
to
please
the
young
gentleman
she
was
talking
to
i
think
he
did
look
rather
gratified
for
my
own
part
the
idea
worried
my
little
head
for
a
long
time
children
give
much
more
heed
to
general
propositions
of
this
kind
than
is
commonly
supposed
there
was
one
disadvantage
in
the
very
fulness
of
the
sympathy
the
ladies
gave
each
other
over
their
little
affairs
the
main
point
was
apt
to
be
neglected
for
branches
of
the
subject
if
minchin
consulted
buller
about
a
cook
that
particular
cook
might
be
discussed
for
five
minutes
but
the
rest
of
a
two
hours
visit
would
probably
be
devoted
to
recollections
of
aunt
theresa
cooks
past
and
present
minchin
coloured
cooks
in
jamaica
and
the
cooks
engaged
by
the
mothers
and
grandmothers
of
both
ladies
thus
when
aunt
theresa
took
counsel
with
her
friends
about
poor
matilda
they
hardly
kept
to
matilda
case
long
enough
even
to
master
the
facts
and
on
this
particular
occasion
john
plunged
at
once
into
a
series
of
illustrative
anecdotes
of
the
most
terrible
kind
for
she
always
talked
as
she
dressed
in
extremes
the
moral
of
every
story
was
that
matilda
should
be
sent
to
school
and
i
send
you
over
last
year
numbers
of
the
and
dear
buller
there
are
always
lots
of
interesting
letters
about
people
husbands
and
children
and
education
and
that
sort
of
thing
in
the
column
next
to
the
pastry
and
cooling
drinks
receipts
there
was
a
wonderfully
clever
letter
from
a
about
the
difficulty
of
managing
young
girls
and
recommending
a
strict
school
where
he
had
sent
his
daughter
and
next
month
there
were
long
letters
from
five
mothers
and
countess
who
had
not
been
able
to
manage
their
daughters
and
had
sent
them
to
this
school
and
were
in
every
way
satisfied
john
declared
that
all
the
letters
were
written
by
one
person
to
advertise
the
school
but
he
always
does
say
those
sort
of
things
about
anything
i
interested
in
you
very
kind
said
buller
there
was
a
most
extraordinary
correspondence
too
after
that
shoemaker
daughter
in
lambeth
was
tried
for
poisoning
her
little
brother
continued
john
the
had
an
article
on
it
i
believe
only
john
ca
bring
papers
home
from
the
mess
so
i
did
see
it
the
letters
were
all
about
all
the
dreadful
things
done
by
girls
in
their
teens
there
were
letters
from
twelve
i
know
because
the
editor
had
to
put
numbers
to
them
and
four
and
anxious
widower
and
minister
and
three
but
the
most
awful
letter
was
from
student
of
human
nature
and
it
ended
up
that
every
girl
of
fifteen
was
a
murderess
at
heart
if
i
can
only
lay
my
hand
on
that
number
but
i
lent
it
to
so
many
people
and
there
was
a
capital
paper
pattern
in
it
too
of
the
à
ready
pricked
at
this
point
uncle
buller
literally
exploded
from
the
room
aunt
theresa
said
something
about
draughts
but
i
think
even
john
must
have
been
aware
that
it
was
the
major
who
banged
the
door
i
was
sitting
on
the
footstool
by
the
making
a
for
my
doll
my
work
had
been
suspended
by
horror
at
revelations
and
major
buller
exit
gave
an
additional
shock
in
which
i
lost
my
favourite
needle
a
dear
little
stumpy
one
with
a
very
fine
point
and
a
very
big
eye
easy
to
thread
and
delightful
to
use
when
john
went
away
major
buller
came
back
i
am
sorry
i
banged
the
door
my
dear
said
he
kindly
but
whatever
the
tempers
of
girls
may
be
made
of
at
fifteen
mine
is
by
no
means
perfect
i
regret
to
say
at
fifty
and
i
stand
that
woman
my
dear
theresa
let
me
implore
you
to
put
all
this
trash
out
of
your
head
and
get
proper
medical
advice
for
the
child
at
once
and
i
do
like
to
seem
unreasonable
my
dear
but
if
you
must
read
those
delectable
articles
to
which
john
refers
i
wish
you
read
them
at
her
house
and
not
bring
them
into
ours
i
rather
the
coarsest
novel
that
ever
was
written
were
picked
up
by
the
children
if
the
broad
lines
of
good
and
evil
were
clearly
marked
in
it
than
this
morbid
muddle
of
disease
and
crime
and
unprincipled
parents
and
practitioners
uncle
buller
seldom
interfered
so
warmly
indeed
he
seldom
interfered
at
all
i
think
aunt
theresa
would
have
been
glad
if
he
would
have
advised
her
oftener
indeed
edward
said
she
i
do
anything
you
think
right
and
sure
i
would
read
anything
improper
myself
much
less
let
the
children
and
as
to
the
and
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
that
coming
into
the
house
unless
i
send
for
it
john
is
always
promising
to
lend
me
the
but
she
never
remembers
it
and
you
have
proper
advice
for
matilda
at
once
certainly
my
dear
buller
was
in
the
habit
of
asking
the
regimental
surgeon
advice
in
small
matters
and
of
employing
a
civilian
doctor
whose
fees
made
him
feel
better
worth
having
in
serious
illness
she
estimated
the
seriousness
of
a
case
by
danger
rather
than
delicacy
so
the
surgeon
came
to
see
matilda
and
having
heard
her
cough
promised
to
send
a
little
something
and
she
was
ordered
to
keep
indoors
and
out
of
draughts
and
take
a
tablespoonful
three
times
a
day
matilda
had
not
gone
graciously
through
the
ordeal
of
facing
the
principal
surgeon
in
his
uniform
and
putting
out
her
tongue
for
his
inspection
and
his
prescriptions
did
not
tend
to
reconcile
her
to
being
doctored
fresh
air
was
the
only
thing
that
hitherto
had
seemed
to
have
any
effect
on
her
aches
and
pains
or
to
soothe
her
hysterical
irritability
and
of
this
she
was
now
deprived
when
aunt
theresa
called
in
an
elderly
civilian
practitioner
she
was
so
sulky
and
uncommunicative
and
so
resolutely
refused
to
acknowledge
to
any
ailments
that
his
other
prescriptions
having
failed
to
cure
her
lassitude
and
his
pompous
manner
and
professional
visits
rather
provoking
her
feverish
perversity
the
old
doctor
also
recommended
that
she
should
be
sent
to
school
medical
advice
is
very
authoritative
and
yet
uncle
buller
hesitated
it
like
packing
a
troublesome
son
off
to
the
colonies
my
dear
said
he
and
though
brown
may
be
justified
in
transferring
his
responsibilities
elsewhere
i
do
think
that
parents
should
get
rid
of
theirs
in
this
easy
fashion
but
when
eleanor
came
the
major
views
underwent
a
change
if
i
went
with
matilda
and
we
had
eleanor
arkwright
for
a
friend
he
allowed
that
he
would
consent
that
is
if
the
girl
is
willing
to
go
i
will
send
no
child
of
mine
out
of
my
house
against
her
will
major
buller
asked
her
himself
asked
with
so
much
kindness
and
expressed
such
cheery
hopes
that
change
of
air
regular
occupation
and
the
society
of
other
young
people
would
make
her
feel
stronger
and
happier
than
she
had
seemed
to
be
of
late
that
to
say
that
matilda
would
have
gone
anywhere
and
done
anything
her
father
wished
is
to
give
a
feeble
idea
of
the
gush
of
gratitude
which
his
sensible
and
sympathetic
words
awoke
in
her
unfortunately
she
could
not
keep
herself
from
crying
just
when
she
most
wanted
to
speak
and
uncle
buller
having
a
horror
of
scenes
cut
short
the
one
interview
in
which
matilda
felt
disposed
to
confide
in
her
parents
but
she
confided
to
me
when
she
came
to
bed
that
night
did
mind
her
crying
between
the
sentences
that
she
was
very
very
sorry
to
have
been
so
cross
and
stupid
and
that
if
we
were
not
going
to
school
she
meant
to
try
and
be
very
different
i
begged
her
to
let
me
ask
uncle
buller
to
keep
us
at
home
a
little
longer
but
matilda
would
not
hear
of
it
no
no
she
sobbed
not
now
i
should
like
to
do
something
he
and
mamma
want
and
they
want
us
to
go
to
school
for
my
own
part
i
was
quite
willing
to
go
especially
after
i
had
seen
eleanor
arkwright
so
we
were
sent
to
bush
house
chapter
xiii
at
school
the
bridget
posies
summer
health
we
knew
when
it
was
summer
at
bush
house
because
there
was
a
by
the
gate
which
had
one
large
bunch
of
flowers
on
it
in
the
summer
when
eleanor
and
i
and
matilda
were
at
school
there
as
we
left
the
house
in
double
file
to
take
our
daily
exercise
on
the
the
girls
would
bob
their
heads
to
catch
a
whiff
of
the
scent
as
they
passed
or
to
let
the
cool
fragrant
flowers
brush
their
foreheads
on
this
point
madame
our
french
governess
remonstrated
in
vain
we
took
turns
for
the
side
next
to
the
lilac
and
sniffed
away
as
long
as
there
was
anything
to
smell
even
when
the
delicate
colour
began
to
turn
brown
and
the
fragrance
vanished
we
were
loth
to
believe
that
the
blossoms
were
fading
i
think
i
have
got
a
cold
in
my
head
said
matilda
who
had
plunged
her
nose
into
the
cluster
one
day
in
vain
you
have
a
cough
ma
foi
mademoiselle
buller
replied
madame
who
seemed
to
labour
under
the
idea
that
matilda
rather
enjoyed
this
privilege
but
i
had
tried
the
myself
with
no
better
success
i
think
i
whispered
to
eleanor
in
english
that
we
have
smelt
it
all
up
français
mesdemoiselles
cried
madame
and
we
filed
out
into
the
dusty
street
at
the
corner
of
which
sat
another
of
our
visible
tokens
of
the
coming
of
the
season
of
flowers
a
dirty
shrivelled
old
irishwoman
full
of
benedictions
and
beggary
who
all
through
the
summer
sold
posies
to
the
we
were
good
customers
to
her
we
were
all
more
or
less
sentimental
more
or
less
homesick
and
had
more
or
less
of
that
susceptibility
to
the
influence
of
scents
which
may
some
day
be
the
basis
of
a
new
school
of
medicine
one
girl
had
cultivated
pinks
and
de
in
her
own
garden
at
home
and
bridget
was
soon
wise
enough
to
discover
that
a
nosegay
composed
of
these
materials
was
an
irresistible
temptation
to
that
particular
customer
another
had
a
craving
for
the
sight
and
smell
of
southernwood
or
old
man
as
eleanor
called
it
and
preferred
it
in
combination
with
bachelor
buttons
there
was
an
old
woman
home
whom
we
used
to
go
to
tea
with
when
we
were
children
my
brother
and
i
she
said
there
were
such
big
bunches
of
southernwood
by
her
cottage
and
bachelor
buttons
all
round
the
garden
the
brother
was
dead
i
knew
and
there
were
two
flattened
buttons
and
a
bit
of
withered
old
man
gummed
into
her
bible
picked
the
last
day
we
were
out
together
before
he
was
taken
ill
with
scarlet
fever
she
told
me
she
had
the
boy
portrait
in
a
standing
frame
and
little
space
as
we
had
in
our
bedrooms
the
other
girls
piled
their
brushes
and
on
one
side
of
the
as
best
they
could
and
left
the
rest
of
the
sacred
to
his
picture
and
to
the
bible
and
the
jar
of
bridget
flowers
which
stood
before
the
likeness
as
if
it
had
been
that
of
a
patron
saint
for
my
own
part
i
was
very
ignorant
of
the
names
and
properties
of
english
flowers
i
knew
some
by
sight
from
adelaide
bouquets
and
from
my
sketches
and
i
knew
the
names
of
others
of
which
adolphe
had
given
me
plants
and
of
which
i
was
glad
to
see
the
flower
as
i
had
plenty
of
i
was
a
liberal
customer
and
i
made
old
bridget
tell
me
the
names
of
the
flowers
in
her
bunches
i
have
since
found
out
that
whenever
she
was
at
fault
she
composed
a
name
upon
the
spot
with
the
ready
wit
and
desire
to
please
characteristic
of
her
nation
these
names
were
chiefly
connected
with
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
saints
the
lord
blesh
ye
my
dear
she
would
say
that
flower
or
sure
it
the
virgin
and
a
pretty
name
too
a
herb
which
she
commended
to
me
as
saints
savory
i
afterwards
learned
to
be
tansy
the
youngest
of
us
a
small
silent
little
orphan
had
bought
no
posy
till
one
day
she
quietly
observed
if
you
could
get
me
a
peony
i
would
buy
it
the
peony
was
procured
so
large
so
round
and
so
red
that
some
one
unfeelingly
suggested
that
it
should
be
cut
up
for
pickled
cabbage
the
little
miss
walked
home
with
it
in
her
hand
looking
at
it
as
sentimentally
as
if
it
had
been
a
as
we
had
been
enough
to
laugh
at
it
we
never
learned
the
history
which
made
it
dear
madame
would
certainly
never
have
allowed
us
to
break
our
ranks
and
chaffer
with
bridget
but
that
some
one
had
been
lucky
enough
to
think
of
giving
her
bouquets
madame
liked
flowers
as
ornaments
and
was
sentimental
herself
after
a
fashion
a
sentimentality
of
appearances
she
liked
a
bright
spot
of
colour
on
her
sombre
dresses
too
and
she
was
economical
for
every
day
that
she
had
a
bright
bouquet
a
day
wear
and
tear
was
saved
to
her
she
pinned
the
bright
flowers
by
her
very
clean
collar
and
not
very
clean
throat
and
permitted
us
to
supply
ourselves
also
from
bridget
basket
a
less
pleasant
sign
of
summer
than
the
or
was
the
heat
it
was
hot
in
the
dusty
draughty
streets
of
the
little
town
the
empty
bedrooms
at
bush
house
were
like
ovens
and
the
was
much
worse
madame
would
never
hear
any
complaints
of
the
heat
from
me
or
from
matilda
summer
at
bush
house
in
the
nature
of
things
could
be
nothing
to
summer
in
india
to
which
we
were
accustomed
it
was
useless
to
point
out
that
in
india
the
rooms
in
which
we
lived
were
large
well
shaded
and
ventilated
by
constant
currents
of
fresh
air
also
that
there
our
heaviest
meal
our
longest
walk
and
our
hardest
work
were
not
all
crowded
into
the
hottest
hours
of
the
day
england
is
at
no
time
so
warm
as
india
said
madame
i
suppose
we
are
not
as
hot
as
the
cook
suggested
little
peony
as
we
now
called
her
one
very
hot
day
when
we
sat
languidly
struggling
through
our
work
in
the
stifling
atmosphere
of
the
i
thought
of
her
when
i
looked
at
that
great
fat
leg
of
roast
mutton
we
better
off
than
she
is
and
she
better
off
than
if
she
were
in
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
but
that
does
make
either
her
or
us
cool
said
emma
lascelles
an
elder
girl
do
preach
peony
lessons
are
bad
enough
in
this
heat
i
sha
eat
any
dinner
i
think
said
eleanor
i
can
not
keep
awake
after
it
this
weather
so
it
no
use
i
wish
i
were
back
at
miss
martin
for
the
summer
said
another
girl
we
knew
to
what
this
referred
and
madame
being
by
a
rare
chance
absent
we
pressed
for
an
account
in
english
of
miss
martin
arrangements
in
the
hot
weather
miss
martin
was
a
school
at
which
this
girl
had
been
before
she
came
to
bush
house
i
ca
think
why
on
earth
you
left
her
said
eleanor
well
this
is
nearer
home
for
one
thing
and
the
masters
are
better
here
certainly
but
she
did
take
such
care
of
us
it
was
everlasting
backaches
and
headaches
and
coughs
and
pains
in
your
side
all
along
and
when
the
weather
got
hot
and
it
was
a
very
warm
summer
when
i
was
there
and
she
found
we
got
sleepy
at
work
after
dinner
and
had
headaches
in
the
afternoon
she
said
she
thought
we
had
better
have
a
scrap
meal
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
dine
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
so
we
used
to
have
cold
or
thick
such
as
we
should
have
had
for
tea
or
anything
there
was
and
tumblers
of
water
at
one
and
at
five
we
used
to
wash
and
dress
and
then
at
six
just
when
we
were
getting
done
up
with
the
heat
and
work
and
yet
cool
enough
to
eat
we
had
dinner
i
can
tell
you
a
good
fat
roast
leg
of
mutton
looked
all
right
then
it
cured
all
our
headaches
and
we
worked
twice
as
well
both
at
midday
work
and
at
getting
lessons
ready
for
next
day
after
dinner
i
know
lucy
hissed
peony
through
her
teeth
madame
cette
grammaire
marguerite
vous
plait
said
lucy
as
madame
entered
and
i
gave
her
the
grammar
and
we
set
to
work
again
full
of
envy
for
the
domestic
arrangements
of
miss
martin
establishment
during
the
dog
days
if
there
is
a
point
on
which
eleanor
and
i
are
quite
agreed
among
the
many
points
we
discuss
and
do
not
always
agree
upon
it
is
that
of
the
need
for
a
higher
education
for
women
but
ill
as
i
think
our
sex
provided
for
in
this
respect
and
highly
as
i
value
good
teaching
i
would
rather
send
a
growing
girl
to
a
miss
martin
even
for
fewer
educational
advantages
and
let
her
start
in
life
with
a
sound
healthy
constitution
and
a
reasonable
set
of
nerves
than
have
her
head
crammed
and
her
health
neglected
under
the
first
masters
and
so
good
an
overseer
as
madame
to
boot
for
madame
certainly
made
us
work
and
was
herself
indefatigable
the
reckless
imprudence
of
most
girls
in
matters
of
health
is
proverbial
the
wisdom
of
young
matrons
in
this
respect
is
not
beyond
reproach
and
the
lore
which
long
and
painful
experience
has
given
to
older
women
is
apt
like
other
lessons
from
that
stern
teacher
to
come
too
late
it
should
at
least
avail
to
benefit
their
daughters
were
it
not
that
custom
prescribes
that
they
also
should
be
kept
in
the
dark
till
instructed
in
turn
by
the
lamentable
results
of
their
ignorance
too
often
only
when
these
are
past
repair
whether
though
there
are
many
things
that
women
have
no
knowledge
of
and
many
more
of
which
their
knowledge
is
superficial
their
lack
of
learning
on
these
points
being
erudition
compared
with
their
crass
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
health
the
matter
is
again
one
of
education
or
whether
it
is
an
unfortunate
development
of
a
confusion
between
ignorance
and
innocence
and
of
mistaken
notions
of
delicacy
who
shall
say
unhappily
a
studied
ignorance
of
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
is
apt
to
bring
them
in
double
force
about
one
ears
and
this
kind
of
to
bring
delicacy
of
body
in
its
train
where
it
guides
the
counsels
of
those
in
charge
of
numbers
of
young
people
as
in
miss
mulberry
case
it
is
apt
to
result
in
the
delicacy
more
or
less
permanent
of
several
bodies
but
i
am
forgetting
that
i
am
not
preaching
to
eleanor
by
the
kitchen
fire
but
writing
my
autobiography
i
am
forgetting
also
that
i
have
not
yet
said
who
miss
mulberry
was
chapter
xiv
miss
mulberry
discipline
and
recreation
madame
conversation
opinion
of
the
miss
ellen
eleanor
apology
miss
mulberry
was
our
and
the
head
of
the
bush
house
establishment
madame
was
only
a
french
mistress
employed
by
miss
mulberry
though
she
had
more
to
do
with
the
pupils
than
miss
mulberry
herself
miss
mulberry
was
stout
and
i
think
by
nature
disposed
to
indolence
especially
in
warm
weather
it
was
all
the
more
creditable
to
her
that
she
had
worked
hard
for
many
years
to
support
a
paralytic
mother
and
a
delicate
sister
the
mother
was
dead
now
miss
ellen
mulberry
though
an
invalid
gave
some
help
in
teaching
the
younger
ones
and
bush
house
had
for
so
long
been
a
establishment
that
miss
mulberry
was
more
or
less
prosperous
and
could
afford
to
keep
a
french
governess
to
do
the
hard
work
miss
mulberry
was
very
conscientious
very
and
the
pink
of
propriety
her
appearance
at
once
bland
and
solid
produced
a
favourable
impression
upon
parents
and
guardians
being
stout
and
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
old
she
was
often
described
as
motherly
though
in
the
timidity
fidgetiness
and
primness
of
her
dealing
with
girls
she
was
essentially
a
spinster
her
good
conscience
and
her
timidity
both
helped
to
make
her
feel
a
heavy
responsibility
which
should
perhaps
excuse
the
fact
that
we
suffered
at
bush
house
from
an
excess
of
the
meddlesome
discipline
which
seems
to
be
in
girls
schools
i
think
miss
mulberry
would
have
felt
that
she
had
neglected
her
duty
if
we
had
ever
been
left
to
our
own
devices
for
an
hour
to
growing
girls
not
too
robust
leading
sedentary
lives
working
very
hard
with
our
heads
and
having
wholesome
and
sufficient
meals
but
not
as
much
animal
food
as
most
of
us
were
accustomed
to
at
home
the
of
never
being
free
from
supervision
was
both
irritating
and
depressing
much
worse
off
were
we
than
boys
at
school
no
had
we
no
leave
could
be
obtained
for
country
rambles
by
ourselves
our
dismal
exercise
was
a
promenade
in
double
file
under
the
eye
and
ear
of
madame
herself
true
we
were
allowed
fifteen
minutes
recreation
together
and
by
ourselves
in
the
just
after
dinner
but
this
inestimable
privilege
was
always
marred
by
the
fact
that
madame
invariably
came
for
us
before
the
quarter
of
an
hour
had
expired
no
other
part
of
school
discipline
annoyed
us
as
this
did
it
had
that
element
of
injustice
against
which
children
always
rebel
why
she
did
so
remains
to
this
day
a
puzzle
to
me
she
worked
very
hard
for
her
living
a
fact
which
did
not
occur
to
us
in
those
days
to
modify
our
view
of
her
as
our
natural
tormentor
in
breaking
faith
with
us
daily
by
curtailing
our
allotted
fifteen
minutes
of
recreation
she
deprived
herself
of
rest
to
the
exact
amount
by
which
she
defrauded
us
she
can
not
have
pined
to
begin
to
teach
as
soon
as
she
had
swallowed
her
food
i
may
do
her
an
injustice
but
the
only
reason
i
can
think
of
as
a
likely
one
is
that
by
taking
us
unawares
she
i
wo
say
hoped
but
expected
to
find
us
in
mischief
it
was
a
weak
point
of
the
arrangements
of
bush
house
that
miss
mulberry
left
us
so
much
to
the
care
of
madame
madame
was
twice
as
energetic
as
miss
mulberry
madame
never
spared
herself
if
she
never
spared
us
madame
was
indefatigable
and
in
her
own
way
as
conscientious
as
miss
mulberry
herself
but
madame
was
not
just
and
she
was
not
truthful
she
had
either
no
sense
at
all
or
a
quite
different
sense
from
ours
of
honour
and
uprightness
perhaps
the
latter
for
she
seemed
to
break
promises
tell
lies
open
letters
pry
into
drawers
and
boxes
and
listen
at
keyholes
from
the
highest
sense
of
duty
and
which
was
even
worse
for
us
she
had
no
belief
whatever
in
the
trustworthiness
of
her
pupils
miss
mulberry
felt
it
to
be
her
duty
towards
our
parents
and
guardians
to
keep
us
under
constant
supervision
but
madame
watched
and
worried
us
i
am
convinced
in
the
persuasion
that
we
were
certain
to
get
into
mischief
if
we
had
the
chance
and
equally
certain
to
do
so
deceitfully
she
gave
us
full
credit
i
never
could
trace
that
she
saw
any
discredit
in
deceit
for
slyness
in
evading
her
authority
but
flattered
herself
that
her
own
superior
slyness
would
maintain
it
in
spite
of
us
it
vexed
us
all
but
there
were
times
when
it
irritated
eleanor
almost
to
frenzy
she
would
have
been
in
disgrace
oftener
and
more
seriously
on
the
subject
but
that
madame
was
a
little
afraid
of
her
and
was
i
think
not
a
little
fond
of
her
madame
was
a
clever
woman
and
a
good
teacher
she
was
ready
of
tongue
and
indefatigably
industrious
herself
and
slow
stupid
or
lazy
girls
found
no
mercy
at
her
hands
eleanor
unusual
abilities
the
extent
of
her
knowledge
and
reading
on
general
subjects
the
rapidity
with
which
she
picked
up
conversational
french
and
wielded
it
in
discussions
with
madame
and
finally
her
industry
and
perseverance
won
madame
admiration
and
i
think
she
almost
believed
that
mademoiselle
arkwright
word
was
to
be
relied
upon
eleanor
never
toadied
her
which
i
fear
we
others
we
were
so
utterly
at
her
mercy
did
sometimes
assuming
an
interest
we
did
not
feel
in
her
dissertations
on
the
greatness
of
france
and
the
character
of
her
especial
idol
the
first
napoleon
if
madame
respected
eleanor
we
almost
revered
her
she
talks
so
splendidly
lucy
said
one
day
not
that
the
rest
of
us
were
by
any
means
dumb
the
fact
that
english
was
forbidden
did
not
silence
us
and
on
sunday
when
to
undisguised
chagrin
miss
mulberry
allowed
us
to
speak
english
we
chattered
like
sparrows
during
an
anthem
but
eleanor
introduced
a
kind
of
talk
which
was
new
to
most
of
us
we
could
all
chatter
of
people
and
places
and
what
was
said
on
this
occasion
or
what
happened
on
another
we
had
one
good
mimic
emma
and
two
or
three
of
us
were
smart
in
description
we
were
observant
of
details
and
appearances
and
we
could
one
and
all
natter
over
our
small
grievances
without
wearying
of
the
subject
and
without
ever
speculating
on
their
causes
or
devising
remedies
for
them
but
with
eleanor
facts
served
more
as
points
to
talk
from
than
as
talk
in
themselves
through
her
influence
the
why
and
how
of
things
began
to
steal
into
our
conversation
we
had
more
discussion
and
less
gossip
and
found
it
better
fun
one
never
tells
you
anything
without
your
beginning
to
argue
about
it
said
one
of
the
girls
to
her
one
day
i
very
sorry
said
poor
eleanor
you
very
clever
you
mean
said
emma
what
a
lawyer
you
have
made
eleanor
while
we
growl
at
the
toad
tyranny
you
make
a
case
out
of
it
i
regret
to
have
to
confess
that
owing
to
a
peculiarity
of
complexion
madame
was
familiarly
known
to
us
behind
her
back
as
the
toad
well
i
do
know
said
eleanor
puckering
her
brows
and
nursing
her
knees
as
we
all
sat
or
lounged
on
the
floor
during
the
recreation
minutes
in
various
awkward
but
restful
attitudes
i
can
growl
as
well
as
anybody
but
i
never
feel
satisfied
with
bewailing
over
and
over
again
that
black
black
one
wants
to
find
out
why
it
black
and
if
anything
would
make
it
white
besides
i
think
perhaps
when
one
looks
into
one
grievances
one
sees
excuses
for
people
there
are
two
sides
to
every
question
there
be
one
two
three
said
emma
looking
slowly
round
and
counting
the
party
with
a
comical
imitation
of
eleanor
thoughtful
air
there
be
fifteen
sides
to
every
question
by
the
time
we
all
learnt
to
talk
like
you
my
dear
eleanor
burst
out
laughing
and
we
most
of
us
joined
her
to
such
good
purpose
that
madame
overheard
us
and
thought
it
prudent
to
break
up
our
sitting
though
we
had
only
had
a
short
twelve
minutes
rest
eleanor
not
only
set
the
fashion
of
a
more
reasonable
style
of
chat
in
our
brief
holiday
hours
but
she
was
apt
to
make
lessons
the
subject
of
discussions
which
were
at
first
resented
by
the
other
girls
i
ca
think
she
began
one
day
it
was
a
favourite
way
with
her
of
opening
a
discussion
i
ca
think
what
makes
henley
always
make
us
put
the
shadows
in
in
cobalt
some
shadows
are
light
blue
certainly
i
think
especially
on
these
white
roads
but
i
do
think
they
are
always
not
in
yorkshire
at
any
rate
however
as
far
as
that
goes
he
paints
his
things
all
in
the
same
colours
whatever
they
meant
for
the
bay
of
naples
or
the
coast
of
northumberland
by
the
bye
i
know
that
i
heard
that
the
shadows
on
the
snow
in
canada
are
really
blue
bright
blue
you
blue
deep
blue
said
emma
how
you
can
talk
shop
out
of
lesson
hours
eleanor
i
ca
conceive
you
began
on
grammar
the
other
day
by
way
of
enlivening
our
ten
minutes
rest
i
very
sorry
said
eleanor
i
fond
of
drawing
you
know
oh
do
let
her
talk
emma
cried
peony
i
do
so
like
to
hear
her
why
are
the
shadows
on
the
snow
blue
eleanor
i
ca
think
said
eleanor
unless
it
has
something
to
do
with
reflection
from
the
sky
eleanor
was
not
always
discreet
enough
to
keep
her
opinion
of
henley
style
to
herself
and
us
she
was
a
very
clever
girl
and
like
other
very
young
people
her
cleverness
was
apt
to
be
aggressive
scorned
compromises
and
was
not
always
sufficiently
respectful
towards
the
powers
that
be
her
taste
for
drawing
was
known
and
madame
taunted
her
one
day
with
having
a
reputation
for
talent
in
this
line
when
her
copies
were
not
so
effective
as
lucy
simply
i
believe
with
the
wish
to
stimulate
her
to
excel
i
am
sure
madame
much
preferred
eleanor
to
lucy
as
a
matter
of
liking
behold
mademoiselle
said
she
holding
up
one
of
lucy
latest
copies
just
glorified
with
a
wide
aureole
of
white
cardboard
mounting
what
do
you
think
of
this
it
is
very
like
henley
said
eleanor
warmly
lucy
has
taken
great
pains
i
sure
it
quite
as
good
as
the
copy
i
think
but
what
do
you
think
of
it
said
madame
impatiently
she
was
too
to
be
easily
put
off
is
it
not
beautiful
it
is
very
smart
very
gay
said
eleanor
who
began
to
lose
her
temper
all
henley
sketches
are
gay
the
thatch
on
the
house
reminds
me
of
the
of
berlin
wool
that
are
kept
after
a
big
piece
of
work
for
the
yellow
tree
and
the
blue
tree
are
very
pretty
there
always
is
a
yellow
tree
and
a
blue
tree
in
sketches
i
do
know
what
kind
of
trees
they
are
i
never
do
the
trunks
are
pink
but
that
does
help
one
for
the
markings
on
them
are
always
the
same
eleanor
french
was
quite
good
enough
to
give
this
speech
its
full
weight
as
madame
kindling
eyes
testified
she
flung
the
drawing
from
her
and
was
bursting
forth
into
reply
when
by
good
luck
miss
mulberry
called
for
her
so
impatiently
that
she
was
obliged
to
leave
the
room
i
had
been
repeating
a
lesson
to
miss
ellen
mulberry
who
lay
on
a
couch
near
the
window
but
we
had
both
paused
involuntarily
to
listen
to
eleanor
and
madame
miss
ellen
was
very
good
she
was
also
very
gentle
and
timid
to
nervousness
but
from
her
couch
she
saw
a
good
deal
of
the
daily
life
of
the
school
and
often
understood
matters
better
than
those
who
were
in
the
thick
of
it
i
think
when
madame
had
left
the
room
she
called
eleanor
to
her
and
in
an
almost
trembling
voice
said
my
dear
do
you
think
you
are
quite
right
to
speak
so
to
madame
about
that
drawing
i
am
very
sorry
miss
ellen
said
eleanor
but
it
what
i
think
and
she
asked
me
what
i
thought
you
are
very
clever
my
dear
said
miss
ellen
and
no
one
knows
better
than
yourself
that
there
are
more
ways
than
one
of
expressing
one
opinion
indeed
eleanor
broke
in
i
do
want
to
be
rude
i
sorry
i
did
speak
so
pertly
but
oh
miss
ellen
i
wish
you
could
see
the
trees
my
mother
draws
how
can
i
say
i
like
those
things
of
henley
like
green
seaweeds
on
the
end
of
a
pink
and
we
lots
of
old
etchings
at
home
with
such
trees
in
them
like
well
like
nothing
but
real
trees
and
photographs
miss
ellen
took
eleanor
hand
and
drew
her
towards
her
my
dear
said
she
you
have
plenty
of
sense
and
have
evidently
used
it
to
appreciate
what
your
dear
mother
has
shown
and
taught
to
you
use
it
now
my
dear
to
ask
yourself
if
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
men
who
could
draw
like
the
old
masters
would
teach
in
ordinary
schools
or
if
they
would
that
could
afford
to
pay
them
properly
without
a
much
greater
charge
to
the
parents
of
pupils
than
they
would
be
willing
to
bear
you
have
had
great
advantages
at
home
and
have
learnt
enough
to
make
you
able
to
say
very
smart
things
but
is
an
easy
trade
my
dear
and
it
would
be
wiser
as
well
as
kinder
to
see
what
good
you
can
get
from
poor
lessons
as
to
the
use
of
the
brush
and
colours
instead
of
neglecting
your
drawing
because
you
do
like
his
style
which
after
all
you
need
copy
when
you
sketch
from
nature
yourself
i
will
tell
you
dear
child
that
my
sister
and
i
have
talked
this
matter
over
before
clever
young
people
are
apt
to
think
that
their
stupid
elders
have
never
perceived
what
their
brilliant
young
wits
can
put
straight
with
words
but
i
used
to
draw
a
little
myself
continued
miss
ellen
very
modestly
and
i
have
never
liked
henley
style
but
he
is
such
a
very
good
old
man
and
so
poor
that
my
sister
has
shrunk
from
changing
still
of
course
our
pupils
are
the
first
consideration
and
we
should
have
had
another
master
if
a
much
better
one
could
have
been
got
but
markham
who
is
the
only
other
one
within
reach
is
not
so
painstaking
and
patient
with
his
pupils
as
henley
and
though
his
style
is
rather
better
it
is
not
so
very
superior
as
to
lead
us
on
the
whole
to
turn
poor
henley
away
for
him
as
to
madame
said
miss
ellen
in
conclusion
she
was
quite
right
my
dear
to
contrast
your
negligence
with
lucy
industry
and
your
smart
speech
was
not
in
good
taste
towards
her
because
you
know
that
she
knows
nothing
of
drawing
and
could
not
dispute
the
point
with
you
there
she
comes
added
miss
ellen
rather
nervously
she
was
afraid
of
madame
i
go
and
beg
her
pardon
dear
miss
ellen
said
eleanor
penitently
and
rushing
out
of
the
room
she
met
madame
in
the
passage
and
we
heard
her
pouring
forth
a
torrent
of
apology
and
in
a
style
peculiar
to
herself
if
in
her
youth
and
cleverness
she
was
at
times
a
little
and
the
vehemence
of
her
when
she
saw
herself
in
fault
was
always
a
joke
with
those
who
knew
her
eleanor
confessions
are
only
to
be
matched
by
her
favourite
jeremy
taylor
said
jack
one
day
she
just
as
bumptious
next
time
all
the
same
said
clement
he
had
been
disputing
with
eleanor
and
the
generous
grace
of
meeting
an
apology
was
no
part
of
his
character
he
had
an
arbitrary
disposition
in
which
eleanor
to
some
extent
shared
he
controlled
it
to
fairness
in
discussions
with
men
but
with
men
only
with
eleanor
who
persisted
in
thinking
for
herself
and
was
not
slow
to
express
her
thoughts
he
had
many
hot
disputes
in
which
he
often
seemed
unable
to
be
fair
and
did
not
always
trouble
himself
to
be
reasonable
by
his
own
account
he
detested
girls
with
opinions
abroad
he
was
politely
contemptuous
of
feminine
ideas
at
home
he
was
apt
to
be
rudely
so
but
this
was
only
one
and
a
later
development
of
clement
and
the
subject
is
a
digression
and
has
no
business
here

eleanor
theories
reduced
to

studies
the
madame
was
not
ungenerous
to
an
apology
she
believed
in
eleanor
too
and
was
quite
disposed
to
think
that
eleanor
might
be
in
the
right
in
a
dispute
with
anybody
but
herself
perhaps
she
hoped
to
hear
her
triumph
in
a
discussion
with
henley
or
perhaps
it
was
only
as
a
punishment
for
her
presumptuous
remarks
that
madame
started
the

the
following
day

madame
english
was
not
perfect
except
that
the
half
are
yellow
and
the
other
half
blue
she
knows
not
the
kind
even
the
poor
little
who
was
at
that
moment
touching
up
a
yellow
tree
in
one
of
the
younger
girls

trying
by
skilfully
distributed
dabs
to
make
it
look

and
laid
down
his
brush
eleanor
who
was
just
beginning
to
colour
a
copy
of
a
mountain
scene
turned
scarlet
and
let
her
first
wash
dry
into
unmanageable
shapes
as
she
darted
indignant
glances
at
madame
who
appeared
to
enjoy
her
bit
of
malice
miss
arkwright
will
observe
that
these
are
sketches
indicating
the
general
effect
of
a
scene
not
tree
studies
i
know
henley
said
poor
eleanor
in
much
confusion
at
least
i
mean
i
do
know
anything
about
sketching
so
i
ought
not
to
have
said
anything
and
i
never
thought
that
madame
would
repeat
it
i
was
thinking
of
and
etchings
and
i
do
like
to
know
one
tree
from
another
she
added
honestly
you
draw
in
pencil
yourself
asked
henley
oh
no
said
eleanor
at
least
only
a
little
it
was
my
drawings
i
was
thinking
of
and
how
she
used
to
show
us
the
different
ways
of
doing
the
foliage
of
different
trees
and
the
marking
on
the
bark
of
the
trunks
henley
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
from
his
portfolio
and
took
a
pencil
from
his
case
let
us
see
my
dear
young
lady
what
you
remember
of
these
lessons
the
pencil
is
well
cut
there
are
flat
sides
for
shading
and
sharp
ends
for
outlines
madame
thin
lips
pursed
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
as
eleanor
with
hot
cheeks
and
hands
came
across
the
room
to
put
her
theories
in
practice
i
ca
do
it
i
know
she
said
as
she
sat
down
and
gave
herself
one
of
those
nervous
twitches
common
to
girls
of
the
age
but
eleanor
nervous
spasms
were
always
mitigated
by
getting
something
into
her
fingers
pencil
and
paper
were
her
favourite
implements
and
after
a
moment
pause
and
a
good
deal
of
frowning
she
said
we
a
good
many
oaks
about
us
and
forthwith
began
upon
a
bit
of
oak
foliage
it
only
a
spray
she
said
it
very
good
said
the
who
was
now
looking
over
her
shoulder
oak
branches
are
all
elbows
she
murmured
warming
to
her
work
and
apparently
talking
to
herself
so
different
from
willows
and
beeches
good
said
henley
as
eleanor
fitted
the
branches
dexterously
into
the
clusters
of
leaves
now
for
a
little
bit
of
the
oak
bark
if
you
please
this
is
only
one
tree
though
said
madame
who
was
also
looking
on
let
us
see
others
mademoiselle
willows
are
nice
to
do
said
eleanor
intent
upon
her
paper
and
the
bark
is
prettier
than
oak
i
think
and
easier
with
these
long
points
my
mother
says
branches
of
trees
should
be
done
from
the
tips
inwards
and
they
do
fit
in
better
i
think
only
willow
branches
seem
as
if
they
ought
to
be
done
outwards
they
taper
so
beech
trunks
are
very
pretty
but
the
leaves
are
difficult
i
think
scotch
pines
are
easy
and
eleanor
left
the
beech
and
began
upon
the
pine
fitting
in
the
horizontal
branches
under
the
foliage
groups
with
admirable
effect
that
will
do
miss
arkwright
said
the
little
your
mother
has
been
a
good
guide
to
you
and
mother
nature
will
complete
what
she
has
begun
now
we
will
look
at
the
copy
if
you
please
eleanor
countenance
fell
again
her
pink
mountain
had
run
into
her
blue
mountain
and
the
interrupted
wash
had
dried
with
hard
and
unmanageable
outlines
sponging
was
the
only
remedy
next
day
henley
arrived
a
few
minutes
earlier
than
was
his
wont
staggering
under
a
huge
basket
containing
a
large
clump
of
flags
and
waterside
herbage
which
he
had
dug
up
bodily
as
he
said
these
he
arranged
on
a
tray
and
then
from
the
bottom
of
the
basket
produced
the
broken
fragments
of
a
red
earthenware
jug
it
was
such
a
favourite
of
mine
miss
arkwright
said
he
but
what
is
sacred
to
a
my
only
consolation
when
she
smashed
it
this
morning
was
the
thought
that
it
would
serve
in
the
foreground
of
your
sketch
saying
which
the
little
man
laid
the
red
crocks
among
the
weeds
and
after
much
pulling
up
and
down
of
blinds
to
coax
a
good
light
on
to
the
subject
he
called
eleanor
to
set
to
work
it
is
good
of
you
said
eleanor
emphatically
when
i
have
been
so
rude
too
it
is
a
pleasure
said
the
old
man
and
will
be
doubly
so
if
you
do
it
well
i
should
like
to
try
it
myself
he
added
making
a
few
hasty
dashes
with
the
pencil
ah
my
dear
young
lady
be
thankful
that
you
will
sketch
for
pleasure
and
not
for
bread
it
is
pleasanter
to
learn
than
to
teach
out
of
gratitude
to
henley
alone
eleanor
would
have
done
her
best
at
the
new
study
but
apart
from
this
the
change
of
subject
was
delightful
to
her
she
had
an
accurate
eye
and
her
outlines
had
hitherto
contrasted
favourably
with
her
colouring
in
copies
of
the
sketches
she
could
not
like
the
old
was
delighted
with
her
pencil
sketch
of
his
crockery
among
the
reeds
and
eleanor
confessed
to
getting
help
from
him
in
the
choice
and
use
of
her
colours
studies
became
the
fashion
among
the
more
intelligent
pupils
at
bush
house
though
i
have
heard
that
experience
justified
the
old
prophecy
that
they
would
not
be
so
popular
with
the
parents
as
the
former
style
had
been
they
like
lakes
and
boats
and
mountains
and
ruins
and
a
brighter
style
of
colouring
he
had
said
and
as
it
proved
with
truth
eleanor
was
his
favourite
pupil
indeed
she
was
in
favour
with
all
the
teachers
a
certain
quaint
little
german
was
our
a
very
good
one
whose
patience
was
often
sorely
tried
by
our
stupidity
or
frivolity
on
such
occasions
he
rained
epithets
on
us
which
from
his
imperfect
knowledge
of
english
were
often
comical
and
roused
more
amusement
than
shame
but
for
eleanor
he
never
had
a
harsh
word
she
was
thoroughly
fond
of
arithmetic
and
gave
her
mind
to
it
to
use
a
good
old
phrase
ah
the
little
man
would
yell
at
us
you
are
so
sometimes
you
do
do
a
sum
and
sometimes
not
but
you
do
never
there
is
not
one
young
lady
of
this
establishment
who
thinks
but
miss
arkwright
alone
i
remember
an
incident
connected
with
the
which
occurred
just
after
we
came
and
which
roused
eleanor
intense
indignation
it
was
characteristic
too
of
madame
ideas
of
propriety
the
weather
was
warm
and
we
were
in
the
habit
of
dressing
for
tea
our
toilettes
were
of
the
simplest
kind
muslin
garibaldis
for
coolness
and
our
skirts
eleanor
matilda
and
i
shared
one
room
on
the
first
wednesday
evening
after
our
arrival
at
bush
house
we
were
dressing
as
usual
when
emma
ran
in
i
so
sorry
i
forgot
to
tell
you
said
she
you
must
put
on
your
muslin
bodies
the
is
coming
after
tea
i
do
understand
said
eleanor
who
was
standing
on
one
leg
as
usual
and
who
paused
in
a
struggle
with
a
refractory
elastic
sandal
to
look
up
with
a
puckered
brow
and
general
bewilderment
what
has
the
arithmetic
to
do
with
our
dresses
emma
saucy
mouth
and
snub
nose
twitched
with
amusement
as
she
replied
in
exact
mimicry
of
madame
broken
english
have
you
so
little
of
delicacy
as
to
ask
mademoiselle
should
the
young
ladies
of
this
establishment
expose
their
shoulders
in
the
transparency
of
muslin
to
a
professor
matilda
and
i
burst
out
laughing
at
emma
excellent
imitation
of
madame
but
eleanor
dropped
her
foot
to
the
floor
with
a
stamp
that
broke
the
sandal
and
burst
forth
into
an
indignant
torrent
of
words
which
was
only
stayed
by
the
necessity
for
resuming
our
morning
dresses
and
hastening
there
eleanor
swallowed
her
wrath
with
her
weak
tea
and
i
remember
puzzling
myself
to
the
neglect
of
mine
as
to
the
probable
connection
between
and
transparent
bodices

we
were
not
jealous
of

popularity
she
was
popular
with
the
girls
as
well
as
with
the

if
she
was
apt
to
be
opinionated
she
was

generous
and
modest
she
was
always
willing

and
the
firmest
seal
of
friendship
she
was
utterly
sincere
she
worked
harder
than
any
of
us
so
it
was
but
just
that
she
should
be
most
commended
but
of
all
who
lagged
behind
her
and
who
felt
severity

created

were
now
on

the
credit

more

it
was
not
so
much
that
i
had
learned
more

and
sympathy
though
i
hope
these
qualities
do
ripen
with
years
and
better

because
matilda
did
most
faithfully
try

fulfil
the
good
resolutions

kindness
had
led
her
to
make
so
far
as
matilda
ailments
were

think
that
may
have
been
of
some
benefit
since
the
torments
which
have
taught
me
caution
in
a
household
haunted
by
boys
i
am
less
confidential
with
my

than
i
used
to
be
and
if
i
do
not
confide
all
my
own
follies
to
it
i
am
certainly
not
justified
in
recording
other
people
not
that
matilda
makes
any
secret
of
the

wasted
on
the

with
the
chiselled
face
and
weird
eyes
whom
we
used
to
see
on
the
riflebury
esplanade
she
never
spoke
to
him
but
neither
for
that
matter
did
his
dog
a
scotch
deerhound
with
eyes
very
like
his
master
and
a
long
nose
which
uncomfortable
as
the
position
must
have
been
he
kept
always
resting
in
his
master
hand
as
the
two
paced
up
and
down
hour
after
hour
by
the
sea
what
folly
miss
perry
talked
on
the
subject
it
boots
not
at
this
date
to
record
never
indulged
a
more
fanciful
feeling
towards
him
than
wonder
just
dashed
with
a
little
fear
but
i
would
myself
have
liked
to
know
the
meaning
of
that
long
gaze
he
and
the
dog
sometimes
turned
on
us
we
shall
never
know
now
however
for
the
poor
gentleman
died
in
a
lunatic
asylum
i
hope
when
they
shut
him
up
that
they
found
the
deerhound
guilty
also
of
some
unhydrophobiac
madness
and
imprisoned
the
two
friends
together
of
course
we
laugh
now
about
matilda
fancy
for
the
insane
gentleman
though
she
declares
that
at
the
time
she
could
never
keep
him
out
of
her
head
that
if
she
had
met
him
successive
times
on
the
esplanade
she
would
have
borne
no
small
amount
of
torture
to
earn
the
privilege
of
one
more
turn
to
meet
him
for
the
and
that
her
rest
was
broken
by
waking
dreams
of
the
possible
misfortunes
which
might
account
for
his
and
the
dog
obvious
melancholy
and
of
impossible
circumstances
in
which
she
should
act
as
their
good
angel
and
deliverer
at
the
time
she
kept
her
own
counsel
and
it
was
not
because
she
had
ever
heard
of
the
gentleman
and
his
deerhound
that
minchin
concluded
her
advice
to
aunt
theresa
on
one
occasion
by
a
shower
of
nods
which
nearly
shook
the
poppies
out
of
her
bonnet
and
the
oracular
utterance
she
got
some
nonsense
or
other
into
her
head
depend
upon
it
send
her
to
school
one
thing
has
often
struck
me
in
reading
the
biographies
of
great
people
they
must
have
to
be
written
in
quite
a
different
way
to
the
biographies
of
common
people
like
ourselves
for
instance
when
a
practised
writer
is
speaking
of
the
early
days
of
celebrated
poets
he
says
quite
gravely
like
byron
scott
and
other
illustrious
men
hogg
the
ettrick
shepherd
fell
in
love
in
his
very
early
childhood
and
of
course
it
sounds
better
than
if
one
said
like
smith
and
brown
and
jones
and
nine
out
of
every
ten
children
he
did
not
wait
for
years
of
discretion
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
not
being
illustrious
matilda
blushes
to
remember
this
early
folly
and
not
being
a
poet
biographer
aunt
theresa
said
in
a
severe
voice
for
the
general
behoof
of
the
that
little
girls
were
sometimes
very
silly
and
got
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
into
their
heads
i
do
not
think
it
ever
dawned
upon
her
mind
that
girls
heads
not
being
which
if
you
do
not
fill
them
will
remain
empty
the
best
way
to
keep
folly
out
was
to
put
something
less
foolish
in
she
would
have
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
that
her
daughters
might
not
be
a
flounce
behind
the
fashions
and
was
so
in
her
motherly
anxieties
that
she
junketed
herself
and
major
buller
to
many
an
entertainment
where
they
were
bored
for
their
pains
that
an
extensive
acquaintance
might
ensure
to
the
girls
partners
both
for
balls
and
for
life
when
they
came
to
require
them
but
after
what
fashion
their
fancies
should
be
shaped
or
whether
they
had
wholesome
food
and
tender
training
for
that
high
faculty
of
imagination
by
virtue
of
which
after
all
we
so
largely
love
and
hate
choose
right
or
wrong
bear
and
forbear
adapt
ourselves
to
the
ups
and
downs
of
this
world
and
spur
our
dull
souls
to
the
high
hopes
of
a
better
anxiety
on
these
matters
buller
had
none
as
to
minchin
she
would
not
have
known
what
it
meant
if
it
had
been
put
in
print
for
her
to
read
matilda
irritability
was
certainly
repressed
in
public
by
school
discipline
and
from
eleanor
companionship
our
interests
were
varied
and
enlarged
but
in
spite
of
these
advantages
her
health
rapidly
declined
and
this
without
its
seeming
to
attract
miss
notice
indeed
she
meddled
very
little
in
the
matter
of
our
health
she
kept
a
stock
of
family
pills
which
she
distributed
from
time
to
time
amongst
us
they
cured
her
headaches
she
said
and
she
seemed
rather
aggrieved
that
they
did
not
cure
matilda
but
poor
matilda
headaches
brought
more
than
their
own
pain
to
her
they
seemed
to
stupefy
her
and
make
her
quite
incapable
of
work
her
complexion
took
a
deadly
pasty
hue
one
eye
was
almost
entirely
closed
and
to
a
superficial
observer
she
perhaps
did
look
what
madame
always
pronounced
her
sulky
then
no
matter
how
fully
any
lesson
was
at
her
fingers
ends
she
stumbled
through
a
series
of
childish
blunders
to
utter
downfall
and
madame
wrath
was
only
equalled
by
her
irony
to
do
matilda
justice
she
often
used
almost
incredible
courage
in
her
efforts
to
learn
a
task
in
spite
of
herself
now
and
then
she
was
successful
in
defying
pain
but
by
some
odd
revenge
of
nature
what
she
learned
in
such
circumstances
was
afterwards
wiped
as
completely
from
her
memory
as
an
old
sum
is
sponged
from
a
slate
to
headache
and
backache
to
vain
cravings
for
more
fresh
air
and
to
an
inequality
of
spirits
and
temper
to
which
eleanor
and
i
patiently
submitted
matilda
still
added
a
cough
which
seemed
to
exasperate
madame
as
much
as
her
stupidity
not
that
our
french
governess
was
cruelly
disposed
when
she
took
matilda
health
in
hand
and
gave
her
a
tumbler
of
warm
water
every
morning
before
breakfast
she
did
so
in
all
good
faith
it
was
a
remedy
that
she
used
herself
poor
matilda
was
furious
both
with
madame
cure
and
miss
mulberry
she
had
a
morbid
hatred
of
being
doctored
which
is
often
characteristic
of
chest
complaints
she
struggled
harder
than
ever
to
work
in
spite
of
her
headaches
she
ceased
to
complain
of
them
and
concealed
her
cough
to
a
great
extent
by
a
process
known
amongst
us
as
smothering
the
one
remedy
she
pined
for
fresh
air
was
the
last
that
either
miss
mulberry
or
madame
considered
appropriate
to
any
form
of
a
cold
this
craving
for
fresh
air
helped
matilda
in
her
struggle
with
illness
our
daily
promenade
was
dull
enough
but
it
was
in
the
open
air
and
to
be
kept
indoors
either
as
a
punishment
for
lessons
or
as
a
cure
for
her
cough
was
matilda
great
dread
night
after
night
when
madame
had
paid
her
final
visit
to
our
rooms
and
we
were
safe
did
eleanor
creep
out
of
bed
and
noiselessly
lower
the
upper
sash
of
our
window
to
please
matilda
whilst
i
sat
sometimes
for
an
hour
or
more
upon
the
bolster
of
the
bed
in
which
matilda
and
i
slept
together
and
nursed
her
head
what
quaint
pale
grave
little
maids
we
were
as
full
of
aches
and
pains
and
small
anxieties
and
and
tender
sympathy
as
any
other
daughters
of
mother
eve
eleanor
and
i
have
often
since
said
that
we
believe
we
should
make
excellent
nurses
for
the
insane
looking
back
upon
our
treatment
of
poor
matilda
we
knew
exactly
when
to
be
authoritative
and
when
to
sympathize
almost
abjectly
i
became
skilful
in
what
we
called
nursing
her
head
which
meant
much
more
than
that
i
supported
it
on
my
knees
softly
but
firmly
i
stroked
her
brow
and
temples
with
both
hands
and
passed
my
fingers
through
her
hair
to
the
back
of
her
head
i
rarely
failed
to
put
her
to
sleep
and
as
she
never
woke
when
i
laid
her
down
i
have
since
suspected
myself
of
unconscious
mesmerism
one
night
when
i
had
long
been
asleep
i
was
awakened
by
hysterical
sobs
she
could
get
into
a
comfortable
position
her
back
ached
so
our
bed
was
very
narrow
and
i
commonly
lay
so
poised
upon
the
outer
edge
to
give
matilda
room
that
more
than
once
i
have
rolled
on
to
the
floor
we
spoke
in
undertones
but
eleanor
was
awake
come
and
see
if
you
can
sleep
with
me
margery
she
said
i
lie
very
straight
i
scrambled
out
and
willingly
crept
in
behind
eleanor
into
her
still
narrower
bed
and
after
tearful
thanks
and
protestations
poor
matilda
doubled
herself
at
a
restful
angle
and
fell
asleep
happily
for
me
i
was
very
well
eleanor
suffered
from
the
utter
change
of
mode
of
life
a
good
deal
but
she
had
great
powers
of
endurance
fatigue
and
muddle
on
the
brain
often
hindered
her
at
night
from
learning
the
lessons
for
next
day
but
she
worked
at
them
nevertheless
and
tasks
that
by
her
own
account
she
drove
into
her
head
in
bed
though
she
was
quite
unable
to
say
them
that
evening
seemed
to
arrange
themselves
properly
in
her
memory
before
the
morning
matilda
came
to
a
crisis
at
last
to
smother
a
cough
successfully
you
must
be
able
to
escape
at
intervals
on
one
occasion
the
smothering
was
tried
too
long
and
after
the
aggravated
outburst
which
ensued
the
doctor
was
called
in
the
bush
house
family
practitioner
being
absent
a
new
man
came
for
him
who
after
a
few
glances
at
matilda
postponed
the
examination
of
her
lungs
and
begged
to
see
miss
mulberry
matilda
had
learned
her
last
lesson
in
bush
house
from
the
long
interview
with
the
doctor
miss
mulberry
emerged
with
a
troubled
face
lessons
went
irregularly
that
day
our
quarter
of
an
hour
recreation
was
as
much
extended
as
it
was
commonly
cut
short
and
madame
herself
was
subdued
she
became
a
very
kind
nurse
to
matilda
and
crept
many
times
from
her
bed
during
the
night
to
see
if
la
pauvre
petite
were
sleeping
or
had
a
wish
that
she
could
satisfy
indeed
an
air
of
remorse
seemed
to
tinge
the
kindness
of
the
heads
of
bush
house
to
poor
matilda
which
connected
itself
in
eleanor
mind
with
a
brief
dialogue
that
she
overheard
between
miss
mulberry
and
the
doctor
at
the
front
door
i
feel
there
has
been
culpable
neglect
said
miss
mulberry
mournfully
but
no
no
at
least
not
wilful
said
the
doctor
and
springing
from
the
best
motives
but
i
should
not
be
doing
my
duty
madam
towards
a
lady
in
your
responsible
position
if
i
did
not
say
that
i
have
known
too
many
cases
in
which
the
have
been
and
some
in
which
they
have
been

holy
living
the
prayer
of
the
son
of
sirach
matilda
went
home
and
eleanor
and
i
remained
at
bush
house
i
fancy
that
when
we
no
longer
had
to
repress
ourselves
for
poor
matilda
sake
eleanor
was
more
sensible
of
her
own
aches
and
pains
she
also
became
rather
irritable
and
had
more
than
one
squabble
with
madame
about
this
time
eleanor
had
brought
several
religious
books
with
her
books
of
prayers
and
other
devotional
works
they
were
all
new
to
matilda
and
me
and
we
began
to
use
them
and
to
imitate
eleanor
in
various
little
devout
customs
on
sunday
eleanor
used
to
read
jeremy
taylor
living
and
but
as
we
never
were
allowed
to
be
alone
she
was
obliged
to
bring
it
unfortunately
the
result
of
this
was
that
miss
mulberry
having
taken
it
away
to
look
it
over
pronounced
it
not
at
all
proper
reading
for
young
ladies
and
it
was
confiscated
after
this
eleanor
reserved
her
devotional
reading
for
when
if
she
had
got
fairly
through
her
lessons
for
next
day
i
was
wont
to
read
the
bible
and
other
good
books
to
her
in
a
tone
modulated
so
as
not
to
reach
madame
watchful
ear
once
she
caught
us
the
books
of
wisdom
and
ecclesiasticus
from
the
apocrypha
were
favourite
reading
with
eleanor
who
seemed
in
the
grandly
poetical
praises
of
wisdom
to
find
some
encouragement
under
the
difficulties
through
which
we
struggled
towards
a
very
moderate
degree
of
learning
i
warmly
sympathized
with
her
partly
because
much
of
what
i
read
was
beautiful
to
read
even
when
i
did
not
quite
understand
it
and
partly
because
eleanor
had
inspired
me
also
with
some
of
her
own
fervour
against
the
great
war
of
ignorance
but
as
i
said
madame
caught
us
at
last
eleanor
was
lying
yet
dressed
upon
her
bed
the
window
was
open
and
i
sitting
on
the
floor
was
giving
forth
the
prayer
of
the
son
of
sirach
with
as
i
flattered
myself
no
little
impressiveness
as
the
chapter
went
on
my
voice
indiscreetly
rose
when
i
was
yet
young
or
ever
i
went
astray
i
desired
wisdom
openly
in
my
prayer
i
prayed
for
her
before
the
temple
and
will
seek
her
out
even
to
the
end
even
from
the
flower
till
the
grape
was
ripe
hath
my
heart
delighted
in
her
my
foot
went
the
right
way
from
my
youth
up
i
sought
after
her
i
bowed
down
mine
ear
a
little
and
received
her
and
gat
much
learning
draw
near
unto
me
ye
unlearned
and
dwell
in
the
house
of
learning
put
your
neck
under
the
yoke
and
let
your
soul
receive
instruction
she
is
hard
at
hand
to
find
behold
with
your
eyes
how
that
i
have
had
but
little
labour
and
have
gotten
unto
me
much
rest
get
learning
eh
mesdemoiselles
this
is
going
to
bed
is
it
ah
give
me
that
book
then
i
handed
over
in
much
confusion
the
thin
copy
of
the
apocrypha
bound
in
mottled
calf
from
which
i
had
been
reading
and
ordering
us
to
go
to
bed
at
once
madame
took
her
departure
madame
could
read
english
well
though
she
spoke
it
imperfectly
the
next
day
she
did
not
speak
of
the
volume
and
we
supposed
her
to
be
examining
it
then
eleanor
became
anxious
to
get
it
back
and
tried
both
argument
and
entreaty
for
some
time
in
vain
at
last
madame
said
what
is
it
mademoiselle
that
you
so
much
wish
to
read
in
this
volume
of
the
holy
writings
wisdom
and
ecclesiasticus
are
what
i
like
best
said
eleanor
eh
bien
said
madame
nodding
her
head
like
a
porcelain
chinaman
and
with
a
very
knowing
glance
i
will
restore
the
volume
mademoiselle
she
did
restore
it
accordingly
with
the
historical
narratives
cut
out
and
many
nods
and
grimaces
expressive
of
her
good
wishes
that
we
might
be
satisfied
with
it
now
in
private
eleanor
stamped
with
indignation
whether
or
no
her
thick
boots
had
fostered
this
habit
i
ca
say
but
eleanor
was
apt
to
stamp
on
occasion
we
had
our
dear
chapters
again
however
and
i
promised
eleanor
a
new
and
fine
copy
of
the
mutilated
favourite
as
a
birthday
present
eleanor
was
very
good
to
me
she
helped
me
with
my
lessons
and
encouraged
me
to
work
for
herself
she
laboured
harder
and
harder
i
used
to
think
that
she
was
only
anxious
to
get
all
the
good
she
could
out
of
the
school
as
she
did
not
seem
to
have
many
advantages
at
home
by
her
own
account
but
i
afterwards
found
that
she
did
just
the
same
everywhere
strained
her
dark
eyes
over
books
and
absorbed
information
whenever
and
wherever
she
had
a
chance
i
ca
say
you
fond
of
reading
said
emma
one
day
watching
eleanor
as
she
sat
buried
in
a
book
for
i
fond
of
reading
myself
and
we
not
at
all
alike
i
call
you
greedy
and
eleanor
laughed
and
quoted
a
verse
from
one
of
our
favourite
chapters
they
that
eat
me
shall
yet
be
hungry
and
they
that
drink
me
shall
yet
be
thirsty

i
are
late
for
breakfast
the

breaks
up

eleanor
and
i
overslept
ourselves
one
morning
we
had
been
tired
and
when
we
did
get
up
we
hurried
through
our
dressing
looking
forward
to
fines
and
a
scolding
to
boot
but
as
we
crept
we
saw
both
the
misses
mulberry
and
madame
conversing
together
on
the
second
landing
we
felt
that
we
were
caught
but
to
our
surprise
they
took
no
notice
of
us
and
as
we
went
down
the
next
flight
we
heard
miss
mulberry
say
with
a
sigh
misfortunes
never
come
alone
we
soon
learnt
what
the
new
misfortune
was
poor
lucy
had
been
taken
ill
the
doctor
had
been
to
see
her
early
that
morning
and
had
pronounced
it
fever
probably
scarlet
fever
and
he
recommends
the
school
being
broken
up
at
once
as
the
holidays
would
soon
be
here
anyway
so
one
of
the
girls
told
us
presently
miss
mulberry
made
her
appearance
and
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
she
ate
hers
hurriedly
and
then
made
a
little
speech
in
which
she
begged
us
as
a
personal
favour
to
be
good
and
if
it
was
decided
that
we
should
go
to
do
our
best
to
get
our
things
carefully
together
and
to
help
to
pack
them
i
am
sure
we
responded
to
the
appeal
i
wonder
if
it
struck
madame
at
this
time
that
it
might
be
well
to
trust
us
a
little
more
as
a
rule
i
remember
peony
saying
madame
told
me
to
help
myself
to
tea
i
might
have
taken
two
lumps
of
sugar
but
i
did
not
think
it
would
be
right
we
were
all
equally
scrupulous
we
even
made
a
point
of
speaking
in
french
though
madame
long
absences
from
the
and
the
possibility
of
an
early
for
the
holidays
gave
both
opportunity
and
temptation
to
chat
in
english
on
monday
evening
at
tea
miss
mulberry
made
another
little
speech
the
doctor
had
pronounced
poor
lucy
illness
to
be
scarlet
fever
and
we
were
all
to
be
sent
home
the
next
day
there
were
to
be
no
more
lessons
and
we
were
to
spend
the
evening
in
packing
and
other
preparations
we
were
very
sorry
for
poor
lucy
but
we
were
young
and
i
do
not
think
we
could
help
enjoying
the
delights
of
fuss
the
excitement
of
responsibility
and
packing
and
the
fact
that
the
holidays
had
begun
we
were
going
in
various
directions
but
it
so
happened
that
we
all
contrived
to
go
by
the
same
train
to
london
some
were
to
be
dropped
before
we
reached
town
one
lived
in
london
and
eleanor
and
i
had
to
wait
for
before
catching
a
train
for
the
north
for
i
was
going
to
yorkshire
the
arkwrights
had
asked
me
to
spend
the
holidays
with
eleanor
there
was
now
nothing
to
be
done
but
for
us
to
go
up
together
all
unexpected
as
we
were
how
we
packed
and
talked
and
ran
in
and
out
of
each
other
rooms
it
was
late
when
we
all
got
to
bed
that
night
next
morning
the
railway
omnibus
came
for
us
and
with
a
curious
sense
of
regret
we
saw
our
luggage
piled
up
and
the
little
gate
of
bush
house
close
upon
us
as
we
moved
off
bridget
the
drew
near
madame
who
had
shed
tears
as
she
bade
us
adieu
opened
the
gate
again
ran
out
cried
shrilly
to
the
driver
to
stop
and
buying
up
half
bridget
basketful
at
one
sweep
with
more
tears
and
much
excitement
flung
the
flowers
in
amongst
us
as
she
went
backwards
off
the
step
on
to
which
she
had
climbed
she
fell
upon
bridget
who
with
even
more
excitement
and
i
think
also
with
ready
tears
clung
to
the
already
moving
omnibus
and
turned
her
basket
upside
down
over
our
laps
i
have
a
dim
remembrance
of
seeing
her
and
madame
seem
to
fall
over
each
other
or
into
each
other
arms
and
then
amid
a
shrill
torrent
of
farewells
and
blessings
in
french
and
irish
the
omnibus
rolled
on
and
bush
house
was
hid
from
our
eyes
chapter
xix
northwards
the
black
country
the
stone
country
we
had
a
very
noisy
happy
journey
to
london
we
chattered
and
laughed
and
hopped
about
like
a
lot
of
birds
turned
out
of
a
cage
emma
sat
by
the
window
and
made
a
running
commentary
upon
everybody
and
everything
we
passed
in
a
strain
of
what
seemed
to
us
irresistible
wit
and
humour
i
fear
that
our
conduct
was
not
very
decorous
but
in
the
circumstances
we
were
to
be
excused
the
reaction
was
overwhelming
eleanor
and
i
sobered
down
after
we
parted
from
the
other
girls
and
thus
became
sensible
of
some
fatigue
and
faintness
we
had
been
too
much
excited
to
eat
any
of
the
prepared
for
our
early
breakfast
at
bush
house
we
had
run
up
and
down
and
stood
on
our
feet
about
three
times
as
much
as
need
was
we
had
talked
and
laughed
and
shaken
ourselves
incessantly
we
had
put
out
our
heads
in
the
wind
and
sun
as
the
train
flew
on
we
had
tried
to
waltz
between
the
seats
and
had
eaten
two
ounces
of
mixed
sweets
given
us
by
the
housemaid
and
deluged
each
other
with
some
very
perfume
belonging
to
one
of
us
after
all
this
eleanor
and
i
felt
tired
before
our
journey
had
begun
we
felt
faint
sick
anything
but
hungry
and
should
probably
have
travelled
north
in
rather
a
pitiful
plight
had
not
a
lady
who
sat
in
the
reading
a
very
dirty
book
of
tracts
and
who
had
witnessed
both
our
noisy
parting
from
our
companions
and
the
subsequent
collapse
advised
us
to
go
to
the
and
get
some
breakfast
we
yielded
at
last
out
of
complaisance
towards
her
and
were
rewarded
by
feeling
wonderfully
refreshed
by
a
solid
meal
we
laid
in
a
stock
of
buns
and
chocolate
lozenges
for
future
consumption
and
thanks
to
eleanor
presence
of
mind
and
experience
we
got
our
luggage
together
and
started
in
the
north
train
in
a
carriage
by
ourselves
we
talked
very
little
now
eleanor
gazed
out
of
her
window
and
i
out
of
mine
in
silence
as
we
got
farther
north
eleanor
eyes
dilated
with
a
curious
glow
of
pride
and
satisfaction
i
had
then
no
special
attachment
to
one
part
of
england
more
than
another
but
i
had
never
seen
so
much
of
the
country
before
and
it
was
a
treat
which
did
not
lose
by
comparison
with
the
limited
range
of
our
view
at
bush
house
as
we
ran
on
the
bright
pretty
suburbs
of
london
gave
way
to
real
country
beautiful
with
grand
timber
big
houses
and
grey
churches
supported
by
the
obvious
parsonage
and
school
and
deep
shady
lanes
with
some
little
cart
trotting
quaintly
towards
the
railway
bridge
over
which
we
rushed
or
boys
in
sitting
on
a
gate
and
shouting
friendly
salutations
as
it
seemed
to
eleanor
and
myself
then
came
broad
fair
pastures
of
fairy
green
and
slow
winding
rivers
that
we
overtook
almost
before
we
had
seen
them
with
ghostly
grey
pollard
willows
in
formal
mystical
borders
contrasting
with
such
tints
of
pale
yellow
and
gay
greens
which
in
their
turn
shone
against
low
distances
of
soft
blue
and
purple
that
the
sense
of
colour
which
my
had
roused
in
me
made
me
almost
tremble
with
a
pleasure
from
this
flat
but
most
fair
country
the
grey
towers
of
peterborough
cathedral
stood
up
in
ancient
dignity
and
then
we
ran
on
again
after
a
while
the
country
became
less
rich
in
colour
and
grander
in
form
no
longer
stretching
flatly
to
distances
of
ethereal
hue
it
was
broken
into
wooded
hills
which
folded
one
over
the
other
with
boldness
of
outline
now
and
then
the
line
ran
through
woods
of
young
oak
with
male
ferns
and
bracken
at
their
feet
where
the
wild
hyacinths
which
lie
there
like
a
blue
mist
in
may
must
for
some
weeks
past
have
made
way
for
the
present
carpet
of
pink
campion
and
now
the
distance
was
no
longer
azure
over
the
horizon
and
the
lower
part
of
the
sky
a
thin
grey
veil
had
come
a
veil
of
smoke
we
were
approaching
the
manufacturing
districts
grander
and
grander
grew
the
country
less
and
less
pure
the
colouring
the
vegetation
was
rich
almost
to
rankness
the
distances
were
heavily
grey
then
tall
chimneys
poured
smoke
over
the
landscape
and
eclipsed
the
sun
and
through
strangely
shaped
furnaces
and
chimneys
of
many
forms
which
here
poured
fire
from
their
throats
like
dragons
and
there
might
have
been
the
huge
retorts
and
chemical
apparatus
of
some
giant
alchemist
we
ran
into
the
station
of
a
manufacturing
town
i
gazed
at
the
high
blackened
warehouses
chimneys
and
furnaces
which
loomed
out
of
the
stifling
smoke
and
clanging
noises
with
horror
and
wonder
what
a
dreadful
place
i
exclaimed
look
at
those
dreadful
things
with
flames
coming
out
and
oh
eleanor
there
fire
coming
out
of
the
ground
there
and
look
at
that
man
opening
that
great
oven
door
oh
what
a
fire
and
what
he
poking
in
it
for
and
do
look
all
the
men
are
black
and
what
a
frightful
noise
everything
makes
eleanor
was
looking
all
the
time
but
with
a
complacent
expression
she
only
said
it
is
a
very
busy
place
i
hear
trade
good
just
now
too
and
you
should
see
the
furnaces
at
night
margery
lighting
up
all
the
hills
it
grand
as
she
sniffed
up
the
smoke
with
i
might
almost
say
relish
i
felt
that
she
did
not
sympathize
with
my
disgust
but
any
discussion
on
the
subject
was
stopped
by
our
having
to
change
carriages
and
we
had
just
settled
ourselves
comfortably
once
more
when
i
got
a
bit
of
iron
filings
into
my
eye
it
gave
me
a
good
deal
of
pain
and
inconvenience
and
by
the
time
that
i
could
look
out
of
the
window
again
we
had
left
the
black
town
far
behind
the
hills
were
almost
mountains
now
and
sloped
away
on
all
sides
of
us
in
bleak
and
awful
grandeur
the
woodlands
were
fewer
we
were
on
the
moors
only
a
few
hours
back
we
had
been
amongst
deep
hedges
and
shady
lanes
and
now
for
hedges
we
had
stone
walls
and
for
deep
embowered
lanes
we
could
trace
the
unsheltered
roads
gleaming
as
they
wound
over
miles
of
distant
hills
deep
below
us
brawled
a
river
with
here
and
there
a
gaunt
mill
or
hamlet
on
its
banks
i
had
never
seen
any
country
like
this
and
if
i
had
been
horrified
by
the
black
town
my
delight
with
the
noble
scenery
beyond
it
was
in
proportion
i
stood
at
the
open
window
with
the
moor
breeze
blowing
my
hair
into
the
wildest
rapturously
excited
as
the
great
hills
unfolded
themselves
and
the
shifting
clouds
sent
shifting
purple
shadows
over
them
very
dark
and
stern
they
looked
in
shade
and
then
in
a
moment
more
the
cloud
was
past
and
a
broad
smile
of
sunshine
ran
over
their
face
and
showed
where
cultivation
was
creeping
up
the
hillside
and
turning
the
heather
into
fields
eleanor
leaned
out
of
the
window
also
excitement
which
set
me
chattering
always
made
her
silent
but
her
parted
lips
distended
nostrils
and
the
light
in
her
eyes
bore
witness
to
that
strange
power
which
hill
country
sways
over
people
to
me
it
was
beautiful
but
to
her
it
was
home
i
better
understood
now
too
her
old
complaints
of
the
sheltered
she
called
it
lane
in
which
we
walked
two
and
two
when
we
went
into
the
country
at
school
she
used
to
rave
against
the
park
palings
that
hedged
us
in
on
either
side
and
declare
her
longing
to
tear
them
up
and
let
a
little
air
in
or
at
least
to
be
herself
somewhere
where
one
could
see
a
few
miles
about
one
and
breathe
some
wind
as
we
stood
now
drinking
in
the
breeze
i
think
the
same
thought
struck
us
both
and
we
exclaimed
with
one
voice
poor
matilda
how
she
would
have
enjoyed
this
we
next
stopped
at
a
rather
station
where
we
got
out
and
eleanor
got
our
luggage
together
aided
by
a
porter
who
seemed
to
know
her
and
whom
she
seemed
to
understand
though
his
dialect
was
unintelligible
to
me
i
suppose
we
must
have
a
cab
said
eleanor
at
last
they
expect
us
said
the
porter
suggestively
which
being
interpreted
meant
thomas
is
in
the
town
to
be
sure
for
the
meat
said
eleanor
the
i
suppose
and
mare
added
the
porter
well
the
boxes
must
come
by
the
carrier
come
along
margery
if
you
do
mind
a
little
bit
of
walking
we
must
find
thomas
we
have
to
send
down
to
the
town
for
meat
she
added
we
found
thomas
in
the
yard
of
a
small
inn
he
was
just
about
to
start
homewards
by
eleanor
order
thomas
lifted
me
into
the
and
then
to
my
astonishment
asked
miss
eleanor
if
she
would
drive
eleanor
nodded
and
climbing
on
to
the
driver
seat
took
the
reins
with
reassuring
calmness
thomas
balanced
the
behind
and
mare
started
at
a
good
pace
up
a
hill
which
would
have
reduced
most
horses
to
crawl
father
and
mother
are
away
still
said
eleanor
after
a
pause
so
thomas
says
but
they
be
back
in
a
day
or
two
we
were
driving
up
a
sandy
road
such
as
we
had
seen
winding
over
the
hills
to
our
left
there
was
a
precipitous
descent
to
the
vale
of
the
river
to
our
right
flowers
and
ferns
and
heather
climbed
the
steep
hill
broken
at
every
few
yards
by
tiny
torrents
of
mountain
streams
the
sun
was
setting
over
the
distant
deadmanstone
moors
little
dropping
wells
tinkled
by
the
roadside
where
dozens
of
fat
black
snails
were
out
for
an
evening
stroll
and
here
and
there
a
brimming
stone
trough
reflected
the
rosy
tints
of
the
sky
it
was
grey
and
chilly
when
we
drove
into
the
village
a
stone
track
which
now
served
as
footpath
had
run
by
the
road
and
lasted
into
the
village
the
cottages
were
of
stone
the
walls
and
outhouses
were
of
stone
and
the
vista
was
closed
by
an
old
stone
church
like
a
miniature
cathedral
there
was
more
stone
than
grass
in
the
churchyard
and
there
were
more
loose
stones
than
were
pleasant
on
the
steep
hill
up
which
we
scrambled
before
taking
a
sharp
turn
into
the
vicarage
grounds
chapter
xx
the
vicarage
keziah
the
dear
boys
the
cook
a
yorkshire
tea
it
was
midsummer
the
heavy
foliage
brushed
our
faces
as
the
old
mare
with
slack
reins
upon
her
back
drew
us
soberly
up
the
steep
drive
and
stood
still
of
her
own
accord
before
a
house
built
like
everything
else
i
thought
of
stone
huge
literal
not
dwarfs
or
standards
the
growth
of
many
years
bent
under
their
load
of
blossoms
the
old
blush
too
rare
now
in
our
bedding
plant
gardens
the
velvety
damask
the
wee
scotch
roses
the
prolific
white
and
the
curious
york
and
lancaster
with
monster
trees
hung
over
the
the
place
seemed
almost
overgrown
with
vegetation
like
the
palace
of
the
sleeping
beauty
as
we
turned
the
corner
towards
the
house
eleanor
put
out
her
left
hand
and
dragged
off
a
great
branch
of
maiden
blush
she
forgot
the
recoil
which
came
against
my
face
all
the
flowers
shed
their
petals
over
me
and
i
made
my
first
appearance
at
the
vicarage
covered
with
it
was
keziah
who
welcomed
us
and
i
have
always
had
an
affection
for
her
in
consequence
she
was
housemaid
then
and
took
to
the
kitchen
afterwards
after
she
had
been
about
five
years
at
the
vicarage
she
announced
one
day
that
she
wished
to
go
she
had
no
reason
to
give
but
that
she
thought
she
try
a
change
she
tried
one
for
a
month
and
did
like
it
arkwright
took
her
back
again
and
in
kitchen
and
back
premises
she
reigns
supreme
to
this
day
from
her
we
learned
that
and
arkwright
who
had
gone
away
for
a
parson
fortnight
were
still
from
home
we
had
no
lack
of
welcome
however
it
seems
strange
enough
to
speak
of
a
fire
as
comfortable
in
july
and
yet
i
well
remember
that
the
heavy
dew
and
evening
breeze
was
almost
chilly
after
sunset
and
a
sort
of
feeling
about
the
rooms
which
had
been
for
a
week
or
more
unused
made
us
offer
no
resistance
when
keziah
began
to
light
a
fire
while
she
was
doing
so
eleanor
exclaimed
let
go
and
warm
ourselves
in
the
kitchen
any
idea
of
comfort
connected
with
a
kitchen
was
quite
new
to
me
but
i
followed
eleanor
and
made
my
first
acquaintance
with
the
old
room
where
we
have
spent
so
many
happy
hours
we
found
the
door
shut
much
it
seemed
to
eleanor
astonishment
but
the
reason
was
soon
evident
as
our
footsteps
sounded
on
the
stone
passage
there
arose
from
behind
the
kitchen
door
an
utterly
indescribable
din
of
howling
yowling
squealing
scratching
and
barking
it
the
dear
boys
said
eleanor
and
she
ran
to
open
the
door
for
a
moment
i
thought
of
her
brothers
who
must
obviously
be
maniacs
but
i
soon
discovered
that
the
dear
boys
were
the
dogs
of
the
establishment
who
were
at
once
let
loose
upon
us
i
have
a
faint
remembrance
of
eleanor
and
a
brown
retriever
falling
into
each
other
arms
with
cries
of
delight
but
i
was
a
good
deal
absorbed
by
the
care
of
my
own
small
person
under
the
heavy
onslaught
of
dogs
big
and
little
i
was
licked
copiously
from
chin
to
forehead
by
the
more
impetuous
and
smelt
threateningly
at
the
calves
of
my
legs
by
the
more
cautious
of
the
pack
they
were
subsiding
a
little
when
eleanor
said
oh
cook
why
did
you
shut
them
up
why
did
you
let
them
come
and
meet
us
and
how
was
i
to
know
who
it
was
at
the
door
miss
eleanor
replied
an
elderly
female
who
in
her
time
ruled
us
all
with
a
rod
of
iron
the
dogs
included
dear
knows
it
not
that
i
want
them
in
the
kitchen
the
way
them
dogs
behaves
miss
eleanor
is
dear
boys
murmured
eleanor
on
which
all
the
dogs
who
were
settling
down
to
sleep
on
the
hearth
wagged
their
tails
and
threatened
to
move
much
good
it
is
me
cleaning
cook
continued
when
that
great
big
brown
beast
of
yours
goes
roaming
about
every
night
in
the
shrubberies
and
comes
in
with
his
feet
all
over
my
clean
floor
it
makes
rather
pretty
marks
i
think
said
eleanor
like
only
not
white
but
never
mind
you
me
at
home
now
to
wipe
their
paws
they
missed
you
sorely
said
the
cook
who
seemed
to
be
softening
i
almost
think
they
knew
it
was
you
they
were
so
mad
to
get
out
dear
boys
cried
eleanor
once
more
and
the
dogs
who
were
asleep
now
wagged
their
tails
in
their
dreams
and
there
more
missed
you
than
them
cook
continued
but
bless
us
miss
eleanor
you
do
look
much
better
for
being
in
strange
parts
that
young
lady
too
looks
as
if
she
enjoyed
poor
health
well
give
me
native
air
there
nothing
like
it
and
you
not
got
back
to
yours
too
soon
eleanor
threw
her
arms
round
the
cook
and
danced
her
up
and
down
the
kitchen
oh
dear
cookey
she
cried
i
am
so
glad
to
be
back
again
and
do
be
kind
to
us
and
give
us
and
brown
bread
toast
and
let
the
dogs
come
in
to
tea
cook
pushed
her
away
but
with
a
relenting
face
there
there
miss
eleanor
take
that
jug
of
hot
water
with
you
and
take
the
young
lady
and
when
you
cleaned
yourselves
have
something
for
you
to
eat
and
you
may
suit
yourselves
about
the
dogs
i
sure
i
do
want
them
you
not
got
so
much
more
sensible
with
all
your
schooling
she
added
we
went
off
to
do
her
bidding
and
left
her
muttering
and
what
folks
as
can
edicate
their
own
children
sends
all
out
of
the
house
for
passes
me
to
come
back
looking
like
a
damp
handkerchief
with
dear
knows
what
cheap
living
and
unwholesome
ways
and
want
of
native
air
cook
bark
was
worse
than
her
bite
she
gives
the
dear
boys
plenty
to
eat
said
eleanor
and
she
provided
for
us
that
evening
in
the
same
liberal
spirit
what
a
feast
we
had
strong
tea
and
abundance
of
sugar
and
rich
cream
we
laid
the
delicious
butter
on
our
bread
in
such
thick
clumps
that
madame
would
have
thought
us
in
peril
of
our
lives
there
was
brown
bread
toast
too
and
fried
ham
and
eggs
and
moor
honey
and
yorkshire
in
the
middle
of
the
table
keziah
had
placed
a
large
filled
with
roses
and
all
the
dogs
were
on
the
hearth
and
they
all
had
tea
with
us
after
tea
we
tried
to
talk
but
were
so
sleepy
that
the
words
died
away
on
our
heavy
lips
so
we
took
keziah
advice
and
went
to
bed
keziah
has
put
the
into
my
room
margery
dear
said
eleanor
i
am
so
glad
said
i
i
would
rather
be
with
you
would
you
like
a
dog
to
sleep
with
you
eleanor
politely
inquired
i
shall
have
growler
inside
and
my
big
boy
outside
pincher
is
a
nice
little
fellow
you
better
have
pincher
i
took
pincher
accordingly
and
pincher
took
the
middle
of
the
bed
we
were
just
dropping
off
to
sleep
when
eleanor
said
if
pincher
snores
darling
hit
him
on
the
nose
all
right
said
i
i
had
begun
a
confused
dream
woven
from
my
late
experiences
when
eleanor
voice
roused
me
once
more
margery
dear
if
growler
get
out
of
my
bed
and
come
on
to
yours
mind
you
kick
him
off
or
he
and
pincher
will
fight
through
the
but
whether
pincher
did
snore
or
growler
invade
our
bed
i
slept
much
too
soundly
to
be
able
to
tell
chapter
xxi
gardening
drinkings
the
moors
wading
batrachosperma
the
church
little
margaret
both
eleanor
and
i
were
visited
that
night
by
dreams
of
terrible
complications
with
the
authorities
at
bush
house
it
was
a
curious
relief
to
us
to
wake
to
clear
consciences
and
the
absolute
control
of
our
own
conduct
for
the
day
it
took
me
several
minutes
fairly
to
wake
up
and
realize
my
new
position
the
window
being
in
the
opposite
direction
as
regarded
my
bed
from
that
of
our
room
at
miss
mulberry
the
light
puzzled
me
and
i
lay
blinking
stupidly
at
a
spray
of
ivy
that
had
poked
itself
through
the
window
as
if
for
shelter
from
the
sun
which
was
already
blazing
outside
pincher
brought
me
to
my
senses
by
washing
my
face
with
his
tongue
which
i
took
all
the
kindlier
of
him
that
he
had
been
of
all
the
dear
boys
the
most
doubtful
about
the
calves
of
my
legs
the
evening
before
as
we
dressed
i
adopted
eleanor
fashion
of
doing
so
on
foot
that
i
might
examine
her
room
as
is
the
case
with
the
bowers
of
most
english
country
girls
of
her
class
it
was
rich
in
those
treasures
which
like
the
advertised
contents
of
lost
are
of
no
value
to
any
one
but
the
owner
prints
of
sacred
subjects
in
frames
of
motley
variety
daguerreotypes
and
photographs
of
the
boys
clement
and
jack
at
different
ages
and
of
the
dear
boys
also
all
sorts
of
things
as
i
exclaimed
admiringly
but
eleanor
threatened
at
last
to
fine
me
if
i
did
not
get
dressed
instead
of
staring
about
me
so
we
went
and
had
breakfast
with
the
dogs
the
boys
will
be
home
soon
said
eleanor
as
we
devoured
certain
plates
of
oatmeal
porridge
which
keziah
had
provided
and
which
i
tasted
then
for
the
first
time
i
must
get
their
gardens
tidied
up
before
they
come
shall
you
mind
helping
me
margery
the
idea
delighted
me
and
after
breakfast
we
tied
on
our
hats
rummaged
out
some
small
tools
from
the
porch
and
made
our
way
to
the
gardens
they
were
at
some
little
distance
from
the
big
and
the
path
that
led
to
them
was
heavily
shaded
by
shrubbery
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
by
a
hedge
which
though
quickset
as
a
foundation
was
now
a
mass
of
honeysuckle
and
everlasting
peas
the
scent
was
delicious
from
this
we
came
out
on
an
open
space
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
garden
where
under
a
wall
overgrown
with
ivy
lay
the
children
gardens
what
a
wilderness
was
eleanor
first
exclamation
in
a
tone
of
dismay
and
then
she
added
with
increased
vehemence
he
taken
away
the
what
will
clement
say
what
is
it
dear
i
asked
it
the
eleanor
repeated
you
know
clement
is
always
having
new
fads
every
holidays
and
he
ca
bear
his
things
being
disturbed
whilst
he
at
school
but
how
can
i
help
it
if
i
at
school
too
of
course
you
ca
said
i
gladly
seizing
upon
the
only
point
in
her
story
that
i
could
understand
to
express
my
sympathy
and
he
got
one
of
the
last
holidays
eleanor
continued
it
was
rather
broken
and
thomas
gave
in
to
his
having
it
then
so
very
mean
of
him
to
have
moved
it
now
and
i
shall
tell
him
so
and
clement
painted
church
windows
on
it
and
stuck
it
over
a
plant
of
ivy
at
the
top
of
the
garden
he
thought
it
would
force
the
ivy
and
he
expected
it
would
grow
big
by
the
time
he
came
home
he
wanted
it
to
hang
over
the
top
and
look
like
a
ruin
oh
he
will
be
so
vexed
the
ivy
plant
was
alive
though
the
ruin
had
been
removed
by
the
sacrilegious
hands
of
thomas
i
suggested
that
we
should
build
a
ruin
of
stones
and
train
the
ivy
over
that
which
idea
was
well
received
by
eleanor
the
more
so
that
a
broken
wall
at
the
top
of
the
croft
supplied
materials
and
stonehenge
suggested
itself
as
an
easy
and
certainly
respectable
model
meanwhile
we
decided
to
do
the
weeding
first
as
being
the
least
agreeable
business
and
so
set
to
work
i
in
a
leisurely
manner
befitting
the
heat
of
the
day
and
eleanor
with
her
usual
energy
she
toiled
without
a
pause
and
accomplished
about
treble
the
result
of
my
labours
after
we
had
worked
for
a
long
time
she
sat
up
pressing
her
hand
to
her
forehead
my
head
quite
aches
margery
and
i
so
giddy
it
very
odd
gardening
never
made
me
so
before
i
went
away
you
work
so
at
it
said
i
you
may
well
be
tired
what
makes
you
work
so
at
things
i
do
know
said
eleanor
laughing
cook
says
i
do
foy
at
things
so
but
when
one
once
begins
you
know
what
i
interrupted
cook
says
you
foy
what
does
she
mean
oh
to
foy
at
anything
is
to
slave
to
work
hard
at
it
at
least
not
merely
but
to
go
at
it
very
hotly
almost
foolishly
in
fact
to
foy
at
it
you
know
clement
foys
at
things
too
and
then
he
gets
tired
and
cross
and
so
do
i
often
what
is
it
margery
i
pulled
out
my
souvenir
watch
and
answered
just
eleven
we
ought
to
have
some
we
worked
so
hard
said
eleanor
laughing
again
haymakers
and
people
like
that
always
have
drinkings
at
eleven
you
know
and
dinner
at
one
and
tea
at
four
or
five
and
supper
at
eight
ah
there
goes
thomas
thomas
thomas
came
up
and
eleanor
discreetly
postponing
the
subject
of
the
for
the
present
sent
a
pleading
message
to
cook
which
resulted
in
her
sending
us
two
bottles
of
and
several
slices
of
thick
the
dear
boys
who
had
been
very
sensibly
snoozing
in
the
shade
divined
by
some
instinct
the
arrival
of
our
and
were
kind
enough
to
share
the
with
us
drinkings
over
we
set
to
work
again
i
was
surprised
to
observe
that
there
were
four
beds
but
as
eleanor
said
nothing
about
it
i
made
no
remark
perhaps
it
belonged
to
some
dead
brother
or
sister
as
the
weeds
were
cleared
away
one
plant
after
another
became
apparent
i
called
eleanor
attention
to
all
that
i
found
and
she
seemed
to
welcome
them
as
old
friends
oh
that
the
grey
primrose
i
so
glad
and
there
are
hepaticas
they
look
like
old
rubbish
do
dig
deep
into
garden
please
for
he
always
getting
plants
and
bulbs
given
him
by
people
in
the
village
and
he
sticks
everything
in
so
his
garden
really
is
crammed
full
and
you
sure
to
dig
into
tulips
or
crocuses
or
lilies
or
something
valuable
does
clement
get
things
given
him
said
i
oh
he
has
plenty
of
plants
said
eleanor
but
then
he
always
making
great
plans
about
his
garden
and
the
first
step
towards
his
improvements
is
always
to
clear
out
all
the
old
things
and
make
what
he
calls
clean
sweep
of
the
rubbish
by
the
time
that
the
twelve
bell
rang
from
the
below
the
heat
was
so
great
that
we
gathered
up
our
tools
and
went
home
in
the
afternoon
eleanor
said
were
you
ever
on
the
moors
did
you
ever
wade
do
you
care
about
did
you
ever
eat
bilberries
or
carberries
but
they
not
ripe
yet
shall
we
go
and
get
some
batrachosperma
and
paddle
a
bit
and
give
the
dear
boys
a
bathe
delightful
said
i
but
do
you
go
out
alone
what
should
we
take
anybody
with
us
for
said
eleanor
opening
her
eyes
i
could
not
say
but
as
we
dressed
i
said
i
so
glad
you
do
wear
veils
matilda
and
i
used
to
have
to
wear
veils
to
take
care
of
our
complexion
eschewing
veils
and
every
unnecessary
encumbrance
we
set
forth
followed
by
the
dogs
i
had
taken
off
my
crinoline
because
eleanor
said
we
might
have
to
climb
some
walls
and
i
had
borrowed
a
pair
of
her
boots
because
my
own
were
so
uncomfortable
from
being
and
they
were
too
thin
for
stony
roads
also
and
though
they
were
prettily
ornamented
they
pinched
my
feet
we
went
upwards
from
the
vicarage
along
hot
roads
bordered
by
stone
walls
at
last
we
turned
and
began
to
go
downwards
and
as
we
stood
on
the
top
of
the
steep
hill
we
were
about
to
descend
eleanor
with
some
pride
in
her
tone
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
view
it
was
very
beautiful
the
slopes
of
the
purple
hills
were
grand
i
saw
moors
now
the
best
part
of
it
is
the
air
though
she
said
the
air
was
in
fact
wind
but
of
a
dry
soft
exhilarating
kind
it
seemed
to
get
into
our
heads
and
we
joined
hands
and
ran
wildly
down
the
steep
hill
together
what
fun
eleanor
cried
as
we
paused
to
gain
breath
at
the
bottom
now
you
come
there
be
four
of
us
to
run
downhill
we
shall
nearly
stretch
across
the
road
at
last
we
came
to
a
stone
bridge
which
spanned
the
river
it
was
not
a
very
wide
stream
and
it
was
so
broken
with
grey
boulders
and
clumps
of
rushes
and
overhanging
ferns
that
one
only
caught
sight
of
the
water
here
and
there
in
tiny
torrents
and
lakes
among
the
weeds
my
delight
was
boundless
i
can
neither
forget
nor
describe
those
first
experiences
of
real
country
life
when
eleanor
and
i
rambled
about
together
i
think
she
was
at
least
as
happy
as
i
and
from
time
to
time
we
both
wished
with
all
our
hearts
that
the
other
girls
could
be
there
too
the
least
wisely
managed
of
respectable
schools
has
this
good
point
that
it
enlarges
one
sympathies
and
friendships
we
wandered
some
little
way
up
the
ewden
as
eleanor
called
the
river
and
then
coming
to
a
clear
running
bit
of
stream
with
a
big
grey
boulder
on
the
bank
hard
by
to
leave
our
shoes
and
stockings
on
we
took
these
off
and
also
our
hats
and
kilting
up
our
petticoats
plunged
bravely
into
the
stream
wet
your
head
shouted
eleanor
and
following
her
example
as
well
as
i
could
for
laughing
and
for
the
needful
efforts
to
keep
my
feet
i
dabbled
my
head
liberally
with
water
scooped
up
in
the
palms
of
my
hands
oh
i
cried
how
strong
the
water
is
and
how
deliciously
cold
it
is
and
oh
look
at
the
little
fishes
they
all
round
my
feet
and
oh
eleanor
call
the
dogs
they
knocking
me
down
how
hard
the
stones
are
and
oh
how
slippery
i
fell
against
a
convenient
boulder
and
eleanor
turned
back
the
dogs
raging
and
splashing
around
her
i
hope
you
not
treading
on
the
batrachosperma
she
said
anxiously
what
is
it
i
cried
it
what
i
chiefly
come
in
for
said
she
i
want
some
to
lay
out
it
a
a
alga
you
know
like
seaweed
only
a
plant
i
looking
for
the
stone
it
grew
near
oh
that
it
you
on
climb
up
on
to
it
out
of
the
way
margery
dear
it
rather
a
rare
kind
of
weed
and
i
do
want
it
to
be
spoiled
call
the
dogs
please
oh
look
at
all
the
bits
they
broken
off
eleanor
dodged
and
darted
to
catch
certain
fragments
of
stuff
that
were
being
whirled
away
with
much
difficulty
she
caught
two
or
three
and
laid
one
of
them
in
my
hand
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
fact
that
it
felt
like
a
bit
of
jelly
and
it
slipped
through
my
fingers
before
i
had
time
to
examine
the
beauty
of
the
jointed
branches
pointed
out
by
eleanor
and
in
a
moment
more
it
was
hopelessly
lost
we
put
what
we
had
got
into
some
for
safety
and
having
waded
back
to
our
stockings
we
put
on
our
hats
and
walked
barefoot
for
a
few
yards
through
the
heather
to
dry
our
feet
after
which
we
resumed
our
boots
and
stockings
and
set
off
homewards
we
go
by
the
lower
road
said
eleanor
and
look
at
the
church
for
some
time
after
eleanor
had
passed
in
through
the
rickety
gates
of
the
south
porch
i
lingered
amongst
the
gravestones
reading
their
quaint
inscriptions
quaint
both
in
matter
and
in
the
manner
of
rhyme
and
spelling
as
i
also
drew
towards
the
porch
i
looked
up
to
see
if
i
could
tell
the
time
by
the
dial
above
it
i
could
not
nor
in
spite
of
my
brief
learning
in
russell
grammar
could
i
interpret
the
latin
motto
hora
the
hour
flies
pray
as
i
came
slowly
and
softly
up
the
aisle
i
fancied
eleanor
was
kneeling
but
a
strange
british
shame
of
prayer
made
her
start
to
her
feet
and
kept
me
from
kneeling
also
though
the
peculiar
peace
and
devout
solemnity
which
seemed
to
be
the
very
breath
of
that
ancient
house
of
god
made
me
long
to
do
something
more
expressive
of
my
feelings
than
stand
and
stare
there
was
no
handsome
church
at
riflebury
the
one
the
bullers
attended
when
we
were
at
the
seaside
was
new
and
not
beautiful
the
one
miss
mulberry
took
us
to
was
older
but
uglier
i
had
never
seen
one
of
these
old
parish
churches
this
cathedral
among
the
moors
with
its
massive
masonry
its
dark
oak
carving
its
fragments
of
gorgeous
glass
its
ghostly
hatchments
and
banners
and
its
aisles
paved
with
the
tombstones
of
the
dead
was
a
new
revelation
i
was
silent
awhile
in
very
awe
i
think
it
was
a
bird
beginning
to
chirp
in
the
roof
which
made
me
dare
to
speak
and
then
i
whispered
how
quiet
it
is
in
here
and
how
cool
i
had
hardly
uttered
the
words
when
a
flash
of
lightning
made
me
start
and
cry
out
a
heavy
peal
of
thunder
followed
very
quickly
do
be
frightened
margery
dear
said
eleanor
we
have
very
heavy
storms
here
and
we
had
better
go
home
but
i
am
so
glad
you
admire
our
dear
old
church
there
was
one
very
hot
sunday
last
summer
when
a
thunderstorm
came
on
during
evening
prayer
i
was
sitting
in
the
choir
where
i
could
see
the
storm
through
the
south
transept
door
and
the
great
stones
in
the
transept
arches
it
was
so
cool
in
here
and
all
along
i
kept
thinking
of
refuge
from
the
storm
a
shadow
in
the
heat
and
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
as
we
sat
together
at
tea
that
evening
eleanor
went
back
to
the
subject
of
the
church
i
made
some
remark
about
the
gravestones
in
the
aisles
and
she
said
next
time
we
go
in
i
want
to
show
you
one
of
them
in
the
chancel
who
is
buried
there
i
asked
my
grandfather
he
was
vicar
you
know
and
my
aunt
who
was
sixteen
my
father
has
got
the
white
gloves
and
wreath
that
were
hung
in
the
church
for
her
they
always
used
to
do
that
for
unmarried
girls
and
my
sister
my
only
sister
little
margaret
i
could
not
say
anything
to
poor
eleanor
i
stroked
her
head
softly
and
kissed
it
one
thing
that
made
me
take
to
you
she
went
on
was
your
name
being
margaret
i
used
to
think
she
might
have
been
like
you
i
have
so
wished
i
had
a
sister
the
boys
are
very
dear
you
know
but
still
boys
think
about
themselves
of
course
and
their
own
affairs
one
has
more
to
run
after
them
you
know
not
that
any
boys
could
be
better
than
ours
but
anyway
margery
darling
i
wish
you
were
here
just
on
a
visit
but
were
going
to
stop
here
always
and
be
my
sister
so
do
i
i
cried
oh
so
very
much
eleanor
chapter
xxii
a
new
home
the
arkwrights
return
the
beasts
going
to
meet
the
boys
jack
hatbox
we
come
home
a
rattler
it
is
not
often
out
of
a
fairy
tale
that
wishes
to
change
the
whole
current
of
one
life
are
granted
so
promptly
as
that
wish
of
mine
was
the
next
morning
post
brought
a
letter
from
arkwright
they
were
staying
in
the
south
of
england
and
had
seen
the
bullers
and
heard
all
their
news
it
was
an
important
budget
they
were
going
abroad
once
more
and
it
had
been
arranged
between
my
two
guardians
that
i
was
to
remain
in
england
for
my
education
and
that
my
home
was
to
be
with
eleanor
matilda
was
to
go
with
her
parents
to
the
benefit
it
was
hoped
of
her
health
aunt
theresa
sent
me
the
kindest
messages
and
promised
to
write
to
me
matilda
sent
her
love
to
us
both
and
the
day
after
they
come
home
eleanor
announced
when
the
day
came
we
spent
most
of
it
in
small
preparations
and
useless
restlessness
we
filled
all
the
flower
vases
in
the
put
some
of
the
choicest
roses
in
arkwright
bedroom
and
made
ourselves
very
hot
in
hanging
a
small
which
belonged
to
the
boys
out
of
our
own
window
which
looked
towards
the
eleanor
even
went
so
far
as
to
provoke
a
severe
snub
from
the
cook
by
offering
suggestions
as
to
the
food
to
be
prepared
for
the
travellers
the
dogs
fully
understood
that
something
was
impending
and
wandered
from
room
to
room
at
our
heels
sitting
down
to
pant
whenever
we
gave
them
a
chance
and
emptying
the
water
jug
in
so
often
that
we
were
obliged
to
shut
the
door
when
keziah
had
once
more
filled
the
ewer
about
after
the
curfew
bell
had
rung
the
cab
came
the
dogs
were
not
shut
up
this
time
and
they
and
we
and
the
arkwrights
met
in
a
very
confused
and
noisy
greeting
god
bless
you
my
dear
i
heard
arkwright
say
very
affectionately
and
he
added
almost
in
the
same
breath
do
call
off
the
dogs
my
dear
or
else
take
your
mother
beasts
i
suppose
eleanor
chose
the
latter
alternative
for
she
did
not
call
off
the
dogs
but
she
took
away
two
or
three
tin
cans
with
which
arkwright
was
laden
and
which
had
made
him
look
like
a
particularly
respectable
milkman
what
are
they
she
asked
crassys
said
arkwright
with
apparent
triumph
in
her
tone
and
serpulæ
and
two
chitons
and
several
other
things
i
thought
of
uncle
buller
collection
and
was
about
to
ask
if
the
new
beasts
were
insects
when
eleanor
after
a
doubtful
glance
into
the
cans
said
have
you
brought
any
fresh
water
arkwright
pointed
triumphantly
to
a
big
cased
in
wickerwork
under
which
the
cabman
was
staggering
towards
the
door
it
looked
like
spirits
or
vinegar
but
was
as
i
discovered
seawater
for
the
aquarium
with
this
i
had
already
made
acquaintance
having
helped
eleanor
to
wipe
the
mouths
of
certain
spotted
sea
anemones
with
a
brush
every
day
since
my
arrival
the
crassys
are
much
more
beautiful
she
assured
me
as
we
helped
arkwright
to
find
places
for
the
we
call
them
crassys
because
their
name
is
crassicornis
i
do
believe
they
live
though
they
are
so
delicate
i
rather
think
it
may
be
because
being
so
big
they
get
hurt
in
being
taken
off
the
rocks
said
arkwright
and
we
were
very
careful
with
these
i
the
serpulæ
wo
live
said
eleanor
gazing
anxiously
with
puckered
brows
into
the
glass
tank
arkwright
was
about
to
reply
when
the
dogs
burst
into
the
room
and
after
nearly
upsetting
both
us
and
the
aquarium
bounded
out
again
dear
boys
cried
eleanor
and
dear
boys
murmured
arkwright
from
behind
the
magnifying
glass
through
which
she
was
examining
the
beasts
i
wonder
what
they
running
in
and
out
for
said
i
the
reason
proved
to
be
that
supper
was
ready
and
the
dogs
wanted
us
to
come
into
the
arkwright
announced
it
in
more
sedate
fashion
and
took
me
with
him
leaving
eleanor
and
her
mother
to
follow
us
in
three
days
more
said
eleanor
as
we
sat
down
the
boys
will
be
here
and
then
we
shall
be
quite
happy
eleanor
and
i
were
as
much
absorbed
by
the
prospect
of
the
boys
arrival
as
we
had
been
by
the
coming
of
her
parents
we
made
a
ruin
at
the
top
of
the
little
gardens
which
did
not
quite
fulfil
our
ideal
when
all
was
done
but
we
hoped
that
it
would
look
better
when
the
ivy
was
more
luxuriant
we
made
all
the
beds
look
very
tidy
the
fourth
bed
was
given
to
me
now
you
our
sister
eleanor
cried
it
seems
to
make
it
so
real
now
you
have
got
bed
we
thoroughly
put
in
order
the
old
nursery
which
was
now
the
room
a
proceeding
in
which
growler
and
pincher
took
great
interest
jumping
on
and
off
the
beds
and
smelling
everything
as
we
set
it
out
growler
was
clement
dog
i
found
and
pincher
belonged
to
jack
they
come
in
a
cab
because
of
the
luggage
said
eleanor
and
because
we
are
never
quite
sure
when
they
will
come
so
it
no
use
sending
to
meet
them
they
often
miss
trains
on
purpose
to
stay
somewhere
on
the
road
for
fun
but
i
think
they
come
all
right
this
time
i
begged
them
to
and
we
go
and
meet
them
in
the
the
was
a
pretty
little
thing
on
four
wheels
with
a
seat
in
front
and
a
seat
behind
each
capable
of
holding
one
small
person
eleanor
had
almost
outgrown
the
front
seat
but
she
managed
to
squeeze
into
it
and
i
climbed
in
behind
we
had
dressed
neddy
head
and
our
own
hats
liberally
with
roses
so
that
our
festive
appearance
drew
the
notice
of
the
villagers
more
than
one
of
whom
from
their
asked
if
we
were
going
to
meet
the
young
gentlemen
and
added
they
be
rare
and
glad
to
get
home
i
reckon
impatience
had
made
us
early
and
we
drove
some
little
distance
before
espying
the
cab
which
toiled
uphill
at
much
the
same
pace
as
the
black
snails
crawled
by
the
roadside
eleanor
drew
up
by
the
ditch
and
we
stood
up
and
waved
our
handkerchiefs
in
a
moment
two
handkerchiefs
were
waving
from
the
we
shouted
and
faint
hoorays
came
back
upon
the
breeze
neddy
pricked
his
ears
the
dogs
barked
and
only
the
cabman
remained
unmoved
though
we
could
see
sticks
and
umbrellas
poked
at
him
from
within
in
the
vain
effort
to
induce
him
to
hasten
on
at
last
we
met
the
boys
tumbled
out
one
on
each
side
and
a
good
deal
of
fragmentary
luggage
tumbled
out
after
them
clement
seemed
to
be
rather
older
than
eleanor
and
jack
i
thought
a
little
younger
than
me
how
d
do
margery
said
jack
shaking
me
warmly
by
the
hand
awfully
glad
to
hear
the
news
about
you
we
shall
be
all
square
now
two
and
two
like
a
quadrille
how
do
you
do
miss
vandaleur
said
clement
look
here
eleanor
jack
broke
in
again
i
drive
margery
home
in
the
and
you
can
go
with
clem
in
the
cab
i
wish
give
me
the
wreath
off
your
hat
too
eleanor
willingly
agreed
the
wreath
was
adjusted
on
jack
hat
and
we
were
just
taking
our
places
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
luggage
that
had
fallen
out
on
clement
side
of
the
cab
some
a
squirrel
in
a
and
a
oh
he
screamed
there
my
take
the
reins
margery
and
he
flew
over
the
wheel
and
returned
in
hand
is
it
a
new
hat
i
asked
sympathizingly
a
hat
he
scornfully
exclaimed
my
hat
loose
in
the
cab
somewhere
if
it
came
at
all
but
all
my
beetles
are
in
here
pinned
to
the
sides
would
you
mind
taking
it
on
your
knee
to
be
safe
and
having
placed
it
there
he
scrambled
once
more
into
the
front
seat
and
we
were
about
to
start
the
cab
was
waiting
for
us
the
cabman
looking
on
with
a
grim
smile
at
jack
whilst
energetic
eleanor
rearranged
the
luggage
inside
when
there
came
a
second
check
have
you
got
a
pin
jack
asked
me
i
see
said
i
what
for
to
touch
up
neddy
with
we
going
home
a
rattler
but
on
my
earnestly
remonstrating
against
the
pin
jack
contented
himself
with
pointing
a
stick
which
he
assured
me
would
hurt
much
more
now
cabby
he
cried
keep
your
crawler
back
till
we
well
away
you
better
let
us
go
first
or
we
might
pass
you
on
the
road
and
hurt
the
feelings
of
that
spirited
beast
of
yours
do
you
like
going
fast
margery
as
fast
as
you
like
said
i
knew
nothing
whatever
of
horses
and
donkeys
or
of
what
their
poor
legs
could
bear
but
i
very
much
liked
passing
swiftly
through
the
air
i
do
not
think
neddy
suffered
however
though
we
went
back
at
a
pace
marvellously
different
from
that
at
which
we
came
we
were
very
light
weights
and
master
neddy
was
an
overfed
underworked
gentleman
with
the
acutest
discrimination
as
to
his
drivers
jack
voice
was
quite
enough
the
stick
was
superfluous
when
we
came
to
the
top
of
the
steep
hill
leading
down
to
the
village
jack
asked
me
shall
we
go
down
a
rattler
oh
do
said
i
hold
on
to
the
then
and
do
tumble
out
down
we
went
the
carriage
swayed
from
side
to
side
i
sat
with
my
arms
tightly
clasped
round
the
and
felt
as
if
i
were
flying
straight
down
on
to
the
it
was
delightful
but
i
noticed
that
jack
did
not
speak
till
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
then
he
said
well
that
a
blessing
i
never
thought
we
should
get
safe
to
the
bottom
then
why
did
you
drive
so
fast
i
inquired
my
dear
margery
there
no
drag
on
this
carriage
and
when
i
once
given
neddy
his
head
he
could
stop
himself
no
more
could
i
but
a
plucky
little
beast
and
i
shall
walk
up
this
hill
out
of
respect
for
him
i
resolved
to
do
the
same
and
clambered
out
leaving
the
on
the
seat
i
went
up
to
jack
who
was
patting
neddy
neck
on
which
he
stuck
out
his
right
arm
and
said
link
what
said
i
link
said
jack
and
as
he
stuck
out
his
elbow
again
in
an
unmistakable
fashion
i
took
his
arm
we
call
that
linking
in
these
parts
said
jack
loxley
peter
thank
you
thank
you
i
very
glad
to
get
home
too
i
should
think
not
these
sentences
were
replies
to
the
warm
greetings
jack
received
from
the
the
last
to
the
remark
you
do
find
a
many
places
to
beat
one
sir
i
expect
i
very
popular
in
the
village
said
my
eccentric
companion
with
a
sigh
as
we
turned
into
the
drive
though
i
say
it
that
should
you
think
well
vita
such
is
life
half
do
you
know
leadbetter
that
the
way
he
construed
it
i
know
you
all
talk
in
riddles
said
i
well
never
mind
you
know
leadbetter
and
all
the
old
books
in
the
house
by
and
by
plenty
of
are
there
the
governor
had
a
curate
once
when
his
throat
was
bad
said
it
was
an
entertaining
library
of
useless
knowledge
i
brought
home
one
more
volume
to
add
to
it
second
prize
for
chemistry
only
three
fellows
went
in
for
it
which
you
need
allude
to
at
and
he
sighed
again
as
we
passed
slowly
under
the
shadow
of
the
heavy
foliage
jack
like
eleanor
put
up
his
left
arm
to
drag
down
a
bunch
of
roses
they
were
further
advanced
now
and
the
shower
of
fell
thickly
like
snowflakes
over
us
over
jack
and
me
and
neddy
and
the
carriage
with
the
on
the
driving
seat
we
must
have
looked
very
queer
i
think
as
we
came
up
out
of
the
overshadowed
road
like
dwarfs
out
of
a
fairy
tale
covered
with
flowers
and
leading
our
carriage
with
its
odd
occupant
inside
keziah
who
had
been
counting
the
days
to
the
holidays
ran
down
first
to
meet
us
beaming
with
pleasure
though
when
jack
in
the
futile
attempt
to
play
with
her
against
her
will
damaged
her
cap
and
clung
to
her
neck
till
i
thought
she
would
have
been
throttled
she
indignantly
declared
that
now
the
young
gentlemen
was
home
there
was
an
end
of
peace
for
everybody
choose
who
they
might
be
chapter
xxiii
i
correspond
with
the
major
my
collection
occupations
madame
again
fête
de
village
the
british
hooray
i
wrote
to
my
old
friends
and
relatives
with
a
full
account
of
my
new
home
rather
a
account
too
i
fancy
from
the
bits
uncle
buller
used
to
quote
in
after
years
i
got
charming
letters
from
him
piquant
with
his
dry
humour
and
full
of
affection
matilda
generally
added
a
note
also
and
aunt
theresa
always
sent
love
and
kisses
in
abundance
to
atone
for
being
too
busy
to
write
by
that
post
the
fonder
i
grew
of
the
arkwrights
the
better
i
seemed
to
love
and
understand
uncle
buller
apart
as
we
were
we
had
now
a
dozen
interests
in
common
threads
of
those
intellectual
ties
over
which
the
changes
and
chances
of
this
mortal
life
have
so
little
power
my
sympathy
was
real
as
well
as
ready
when
the
major
discovered
a
new
insect
almost
invisible
by
the
naked
eye
which
thenceforward
bore
the
terrible
specific
name
of
suggesting
a
creature
certainly
not
less
than
a
rhinoceros
and
surrounding
the
major
name
with
something
of
the
halo
of
immortality
he
was
equally
glad
to
hear
of
jack
beetles
and
of
my
shells
i
had
taken
to
the
latter
as
being
the
only
things
not
yet
collected
by
somebody
or
other
in
the
house
and
i
became
so
infatuated
in
the
pursuit
that
i
used
to
get
up
at
four
in
the
morning
to
search
the
damp
places
and
by
the
river
it
being
emphatically
the
early
bird
who
catches
snails
after
his
great
discovery
the
major
constantly
asked
if
i
had
found
a
specimen
of
yet
it
was
a
joke
between
us
that
new
shell
that
i
was
to
discover
i
have
an
old
letter
open
by
me
now
in
which
writing
of
the
arkwrights
he
says
your
dear
father
daughter
could
have
no
better
home
and
as
i
read
my
father
last
hours
come
back
before
me
and
i
hear
the
poor
faint
voice
whispering
you
got
the
papers
buller
arkwright
will
be
kind
about
it
i
sure
and
it
all
dark
now
and
with
tears
i
wonder
if
he
with
whom
it
is
all
light
now
knows
how
well
his
true
friends
have
dealt
by
me
and
how
happy
i
am
to
be
busy
is
certainly
to
being
happy
and
yet
it
is
not
so
with
every
kind
of
labour
some
occupations
however
do
seem
of
themselves
to
be
i
mean
to
be
so
independent
of
the
great
good
of
being
occupied
at
all
gardening
sketching
and
natural
history
pursuits
for
instance
is
it
partly
because
one
follows
them
in
the
open
air
in
great
measure
fresh
air
that
mysteriously
mighty
power
for
good
anodyne
as
well
as
tonic
dispeller
of
fever
when
other
remedies
are
powerless
and
the
best
accredited
recipe
for
long
life
only
partly
i
think
one
secret
of
the
happiness
of
some
occupations
is
perhaps
that
they
lift
one
away
from
petty
cares
and
petty
spites
without
trying
the
brain
or
strength
unduly
as
some
other
kinds
of
mental
labour
must
do
and
how
delightful
is
fellowship
in
such
interests
what
rivalries
without
bitterness
what
gossip
without
scandal
what
gifts
and
exchanges
what
common
interests
and
mutual
sympathy
in
such
happy
business
the
holidays
went
by
then
the
question
arose
were
we
to
go
back
to
school
very
earnestly
we
hoped
not
and
i
think
the
arkwrights
soon
resolved
not
to
send
eleanor
away
again
as
to
me
the
case
was
different
arkwright
felt
that
he
must
do
what
was
best
for
my
education
and
he
wrote
to
consult
with
major
buller
fortunately
for
eleanor
and
me
the
major
was
now
as
much
prejudiced
against
girls
schools
as
he
had
been
against
governesses
and
as
masters
were
to
be
had
at
the
nearest
town
a
home
education
was
decided
upon
it
met
with
the
approval
of
such
of
my
relatives
as
were
consulted
my
especially
and
it
certainly
met
with
mine
eleanor
and
i
were
very
anxious
to
show
that
idleness
was
not
our
object
in
avoiding
bush
house
the
one
of
my
diaries
that
escaped
burning
has
on
the
one
of
the
many
lesson
plans
we
made
for
ourselves
we
used
to
get
up
at
six
and
work
before
breakfast
certain
morning
headaches
to
which
at
this
time
i
became
subject
led
to
a
serious
difference
of
opinion
between
me
and
arkwright
she
forbidding
me
to
get
up
and
i
holding
myself
to
be
much
aggrieved
and
imputing
the
headaches
to
anything
rather
than
what
keziah
briefly
termed
upon
an
empty
stomach
the
matter
was
compromised
thanks
to
keziah
by
that
good
creature
offering
to
bring
me
new
milk
and
every
morning
before
i
began
to
work
she
really
brought
it
before
i
dressed
and
my
headaches
vanished
though
we
did
not
wish
to
go
back
to
bush
house
we
were
not
quite
unmindful
of
our
friends
there
eleanor
wrote
to
thank
madame
for
the
flowers
and
received
a
long
and
enthusiastic
letter
in
reply
in
french
of
course
and
pointing
out
one
or
two
blunders
in
letter
which
was
in
french
also
she
begged
eleanor
to
continue
to
correspond
with
her
for
the
improvement
of
her
composition
poor
madame
she
was
indeed
an
indefatigable
teacher
and
had
a
real
ambition
for
the
success
of
her
pupils
which
in
the
drudgery
of
her
life
was
almost
grand
strange
to
say
she
once
came
to
the
vicarage
it
was
during
the
summer
succeeding
that
in
which
i
came
to
live
with
the
arkwrights
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
spending
the
holidays
with
a
family
in
the
country
where
i
believe
she
gave
some
instruction
in
french
and
music
in
return
for
her
expenses
that
summer
she
was
out
of
health
and
thinking
herself
unable
to
fulfil
her
part
of
the
bargain
she
would
not
go
after
severe
struggles
with
her
sensitive
scruples
she
was
persuaded
to
come
to
us
instead
on
the
distinct
condition
that
she
was
to
do
nothing
in
the
way
of
lessons
but
talk
french
with
us
to
persuade
her
to
accept
any
payment
for
her
services
was
the
subject
of
another
long
struggle
the
thriftiest
of
women
in
her
personal
expenditure
and
needing
money
sorely
madame
was
not
grasping
indeed
her
scruples
on
this
subject
were
troublesome
she
was
for
ever
pursuing
us
book
in
hand
and
with
a
and
umbrella
to
shield
her
complexion
into
the
garden
or
the
hayfield
imploring
us
to
come
in
out
of
the
wind
and
sun
and
do
a
little
of
dictation
of
composition
or
even
to
permit
her
to
hear
us
play
that
duet
from
the
of
which
the
time
had
seemed
to
her
on
the
last
occasion
far
from
perfect
her
despair
when
arkwright
supported
our
refusals
was
comical
and
she
was
only
pacified
at
last
by
having
the
of
odds
and
ends
of
net
muslin
lace
and
embroidery
handed
over
to
her
from
which
she
made
us
set
after
set
of
dainty
collars
and
sleeves
in
various
modes
sitting
well
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
on
a
with
a
to
keep
away
insects
and
in
bodily
fear
of
the
dogs
poor
madame
i
thought
she
would
have
had
a
fit
on
the
first
night
of
her
arrival
when
the
customary
civility
was
paid
of
offering
her
a
dog
to
sleep
on
her
bed
she
never
got
really
accustomed
to
them
and
they
never
seemed
quite
to
understand
her
to
the
end
of
her
stay
they
snuffed
at
her
black
skirts
suspiciously
as
if
she
were
still
more
or
less
of
an
enigma
to
them
madame
was
markedly
civil
to
them
and
even
addressed
them
from
time
to
time
as
bons
enfants
in
imitation
of
our
phrase
dear
boys
but
more
frequently
in
watching
the
terms
on
which
they
lived
with
the
family
she
would
throw
up
her
little
brown
hands
and
exclaim
extraordinaire
i
am
sure
she
thought
us
a
strange
household
in
more
ways
than
one
but
i
think
she
grew
fond
of
us
for
eleanor
she
had
always
had
a
liking
about
eleanor
mother
she
became
rhapsodical
how
good
so
she
cried
to
me
and
how
truthful
how
altogether
truthful
what
talents
also
my
faith
miss
arkwright
has
had
great
advantages
a
mother
extraordinary
arkwright
had
many
discussions
with
madame
on
political
subjects
and
also
on
the
education
of
girls
on
the
latter
their
views
were
so
essentially
different
that
the
discussion
was
apt
to
wax
hot
madame
came
at
last
to
allow
that
for
english
girls
madame
arkwright
views
might
be
just
but
les
filles
she
held
to
her
own
opinions
with
the
boys
she
got
on
very
well
at
first
they
laughed
at
her
then
clement
became
polite
and
even
learned
to
speak
french
with
her
after
a
fashion
jack
was
not
only
ignorant
of
french
but
his
english
was
so
mixed
with
idioms
that
madame
and
he
seldom
got
through
a
conversation
without
wonderful
complications
from
which
however
jack
expressive
countenance
and
ready
wit
generally
delivered
them
in
the
long
run
i
do
not
know
whether
on
the
whole
madame
did
not
like
arkwright
best
of
all
bon
as
she
styled
him
the
furrin
lady
as
she
was
called
in
the
village
was
very
fond
of
looking
into
the
cottages
and
studying
the
ways
of
the
country
generally
i
never
shall
forget
the
occurrence
of
the
yearly
village
fair
or
feast
during
her
visit
her
anxiety
to
be
present
her
remarkable
costume
on
the
occasion
and
the
strong
conviction
borne
in
upon
eleanor
and
me
that
the
fat
lady
in
the
centre
booth
was
quite
a
secondary
attraction
to
the
furrin
lady
between
us
with
the
raw
lads
and
stolid
farmers
who
had
come
down
from
the
hills
with
their
wise
at
their
heels
if
they
stared
at
her
however
madame
was
not
unobservant
of
them
and
the
critical
power
was
on
her
side
these
men
and
their
dogs
seem
to
me
alike
said
she
both
of
them
they
stare
so
much
and
say
so
little
but
the
looks
of
the
dogs
are
altogether
the
more
she
added
i
should
not
like
to
record
all
that
she
said
on
the
subject
of
our
village
feast
it
was
not
complimentary
and
to
some
extent
the
bitter
general
observations
on
our
national
amusements
into
which
her
disappointment
betrayed
her
were
justified
by
facts
but
it
was
not
our
fault
that
in
translating
village
feast
into
de
she
had
allowed
her
imagination
to
mislead
her
with
false
hopes
she
had
expected
a
maypole
a
dance
of
peasants
gay
dresses
smiling
faces
songs
fruit
coffee
flowers
and
tasteful
but
cheap
wares
of
small
kinds
in
picturesque
booths
she
had
adorned
herself
and
eleanor
and
me
with
collars
and
cuffs
of
elaborate
make
and
exquisite
by
her
own
hands
she
wore
a
pale
pink
and
a
dead
scarlet
geranium
together
with
a
spray
of
wistaria
leaf
in
admirable
taste
on
her
dark
dress
her
hat
was
marvellous
her
gloves
were
perfect
she
had
a
few
shillings
in
her
pocket
to
purchase
souvenirs
for
the
household
her
face
beamed
in
anticipation
of
a
day
of
simple
sociable
uncostly
pleasure
such
as
we
english
are
so
lamentably
ignorant
of
but
i
think
the
only
english
thing
she
had
prepared
herself
to
expect
was
what
she
called
the
briteesh
hooray
dirt
clamour
bottles
stolid
curiosity
beery
satisfaction
careworn
with
and
strange
trust
about
their
wares
and
honesty
over
change
photograph
booths
marionettes
the
fat
woman
the
monstrosity
and
the
teeming
poor
madame
the
contrast
was
terrible
she
would
not
enter
a
booth
she
turned
homewards
in
a
rage
of
vexation
and
shut
herself
up
in
her
bedroom
i
suspect
with
tears
of
annoyance
and
disappointment
whilst
eleanor
and
i
went
back
into
the
feast
and
were
photographed
with
dear
boys
and
clement
clement
was
getting
towards
an
age
when
clever
youngsters
are
not
unapt
to
exercise
their
talents
in
depreciating
home
surroundings
he
said
that
it
was
no
wonder
that
madame
was
disgusted
and
scolded
us
for
taking
her
into
the
feast
jack
took
quite
a
different
view
of
the
matter
the
feast
very
good
fun
in
its
way
said
he
and
madame
only
wants
i
tackle
her
nonsense
said
clement
i
bet
you
a
shilling
i
take
her
through
every
mortal
thing
this
afternoon
said
jack
you
cheek
enough
retorted
his
elder
brother
but
after
luncheon
when
madame
was
again
in
her
room
jack
came
to
me
with
a
nosegay
he
had
gathered
to
beg
me
to
arrange
it
properly
and
put
a
paper
frill
round
it
with
some
grass
and
i
made
a
tasteful
bouquet
and
added
a
frill
to
jack
entire
satisfaction
he
took
it
and
we
heard
him
knock
at
madame
door
after
a
pause
i
sure
she
crying
again
said
eleanor
madame
came
out
and
a
warm
discussion
began
between
them
of
which
we
only
heard
fragments
madame
voice
as
the
shrillest
was
most
audible
and
it
rose
into
distinctness
as
she
exclaimed
anything
sŏh
dirrty
sŏh
meean
sŏh
folgaire
i
nevaire
saw
again
the
discussion
proceeded
and
we
only
caught
a
few
of
arguments
about
customs
of
the
country
for
the
fun
of
it
etc
fun
said
madame
for
a
joke
said
jack
for
the
choke
she
said
and
jack
continued
there
french
for
you
madame
come
along
madame
laughed
she
go
said
eleanor
bien
madame
cried
gaily
for
the
choke
vous
monsieur
ha
ha
come
along
link
madame
said
jack
as
they
came
madame
smarter
than
ever
and
bouquet
in
hand
mais
what
is
this
said
she
take
my
arm
said
jack
i
treat
you
to
everything
mais
what
is
that
said
madame
whose
beaming
only
expanded
the
more
when
jack
explained
that
it
was
a
pecuniary
attention
shown
by
rustic
swains
to
their
young
women
as
clement
came
into
the
hall
he
met
madame
hanging
on
jack
arm
and
absolutely
radiant
you
not
going
into
that
beastly
place
again
said
he
for
the
choke
monsieur
clement
oui
and
with
monsieur
jack
you
may
as
well
come
clem
said
eleanor
and
we
followed
laughing
madame
had
now
no
time
for
discontent
jack
held
her
fast
he
gave
her
gingerbread
at
one
stall
and
gingerbeer
at
another
and
cracked
nuts
for
her
all
along
he
vowed
that
the
were
flowers
and
the
empty
bottles
and
offered
to
buy
her
a
pair
of
spectacles
to
see
matters
more
clearly
with
couleur
de
rose
laughed
madame
we
went
in
a
body
to
the
marionettes
and
madame
screamed
as
we
climbed
the
inclined
plane
to
enter
and
scrambled
down
the
frail
scaffolding
to
the
reserved
seats
these
cost
twopence
a
head
and
were
reserved
for
us
alone
the
dolls
were
really
cleverly
managed
they
performed
the
closing
scenes
of
a
pantomime
the
policeman
came
to
pieces
when
clown
and
harlequin
pulled
at
him
people
threw
their
heads
at
each
other
and
shook
their
arms
off
the
transformation
scene
was
really
pretty
and
it
only
added
to
the
joke
that
the
dirty
old
proprietor
burned
the
red
light
under
our
very
noses
amid
a
storm
of
chaff
from
jack
from
the
marionettes
we
went
to
the
fat
woman
a
loathsome
sight
which
turned
me
sick
but
for
some
inexplicable
reason
seemed
highly
to
gratify
madame
she
and
jack
came
out
in
fits
of
laughter
and
he
said
now
for
the
monstrosity
it
just
suit
you
madame
at
the
door
madame
paused
mais
ce
pas
pour
des
petites
filles
she
said
glancing
at
eleanor
and
me
said
jack
who
was
struggling
through
the
crowd
which
was
dense
here
it
feels
nothing
it
in
a
bottle
come
along
all
right
madame
said
eleanor
smiling
we
wait
for
you
outside
we
next
proceeded
to
the
photographer
where
jack
and
madame
were
photographed
together
with
pincher
by
madame
desire
she
was
now
led
to
the
bazaar
where
she
bought
a
collar
for
pincher
two
charming
china
boxes
in
the
shape
of
heads
for
eleanor
and
her
mother
a
fan
for
me
a
for
monsieur
le
pasteur
and
some
for
clement
by
this
time
some
children
had
gathered
round
us
the
children
of
the
district
were
especially
handsome
and
madame
was
much
smitten
by
their
rosy
cheeks
and
flaxen
hair
ah
she
sighed
i
must
make
some
little
presents
to
the
children
and
she
looked
anxiously
over
the
stalls
violin
one
and
six
said
the
saleswoman
nice
for
a
little
girl
half
a
fiddlestick
said
jack
promptly
what
have
you
got
for
a
halfpenny
them
halfpenny
balls
whips
and
dolls
them
churns
and
mugs
is
a
halfpenny
and
so
the
little
tin
plates
them
the
halfpenny
monkeys
on
sticks
now
madame
said
jack
put
that
back
and
give
me
a
shilling
there
are
your
presents
and
now
for
the
children
madame
showed
a
decided
disposition
to
reward
personal
beauty
which
jack
overruled
at
once
the
prettiest
i
see
myself
letting
you
church
sunday
scholars
is
my
tip
and
i
shall
put
them
through
the
catechism
test
look
here
young
un
what
your
name
who
gave
you
this
name
ma
godfeythers
and
godmoothers
the
young
urchin
began
that
do
said
jack
take
your
whip
and
be
thankful
now
my
little
lass
who
gave
you
this
name
me
godfeythers
all
right
take
your
doll
and
drop
a
curtsy
and
mind
you
do
take
the
curtsy
and
drop
your
doll
now
my
boy
tell
me
how
many
there
be
ten
which
be
they
i
mean
take
your
monkey
and
make
your
bow
next
child
come
up
clem
eleanor
and
i
kept
back
the
crowd
as
well
as
we
could
but
children
pressed
in
on
all
sides
clem
brought
a
shilling
out
of
his
pocket
and
handed
it
over
to
jack
you
won
your
bet
old
man
he
said
you
a
good
fellow
clem
i
say
lay
it
out
among
the
halfpenny
lot
will
you
and
then
give
them
to
madame
keep
your
eye
open
for
dissenters
and
send
the
church
children
first
the
halfpennyworths
proved
to
be
sufficient
for
all
however
though
the
orthodoxy
of
one
or
two
seemed
doubtful
madame
was
tired
but
the
position
had
pleased
her
and
she
gave
away
the
toys
with
a
charming
grace
we
were
leaving
the
fair
when
some
small
urchins
who
had
either
got
or
hoped
to
get
presents
and
were
i
suspected
partly
impelled
also
by
a
sense
of
the
striking
nature
of
madame
appearance
set
up
a
lusty
cheer
madame
paused
her
eyes
brightened
her
thin
lips
parted
with
a
smile
in
a
voice
of
intense
satisfaction
she
murmured
it
is
the
briteesh
hooray
chapter
xxiv
we
and
the
boys
we
and
the
boys
and
our
fads
the
lamp
of
zeal
clement
on
unreality
jack
ointment
our
life
on
the
moors
was
i
suppose
monotonous
i
do
not
think
we
ever
found
it
dull
but
it
was
not
broken
as
a
rule
by
striking
incidents
the
coming
and
going
of
the
boys
were
our
chief
events
we
packed
for
them
when
they
went
away
we
wrote
long
letters
to
them
and
received
brief
but
pithy
replies
we
spoke
on
their
behalf
when
they
wanted
clothes
or
we
knew
exactly
how
to
bring
the
news
of
good
marks
in
school
and
increased
subscriptions
to
cricket
to
bear
in
effective
combination
upon
the
parental
mind
and
were
amply
rewarded
by
half
a
sheet
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
a
piece
in
a
the
arkwrights
had
a
strange
habit
of
sending
coin
of
the
realm
by
post
done
up
like
botanical
specimens
with
brief
directions
as
to
the
care
of
garden
or
collection
and
perhaps
a
rude
outline
of
the
nose
in
a
great
hurry
from
your
loving
and
grateful
bro
we
kept
their
gardens
tidy
preserved
their
collections
from
dust
damp
and
keziah
and
knitted
socks
for
them
i
learned
to
knit
of
course
every
woman
knits
in
that
village
of
stone
and
between
lights
eleanor
and
i
plied
our
needles
on
the
boys
behalf
and
counted
the
days
to
the
holidays
we
had
fresh
fads
every
holidays
many
of
our
plans
were
ambitious
enough
and
the
results
would
no
doubt
have
been
great
had
they
been
fully
carried
out
but
midsummer
holidays
though
long
are
limited
in
length
once
we
made
ourselves
into
a
field
naturalists
club
we
girls
gave
up
our
spare
dress
wardrobe
for
a
museum
we
subdivided
the
shelves
and
proposed
to
make
a
perfect
collection
of
the
flora
and
entomology
of
the
neighbourhood
eleanor
and
i
really
did
continue
to
add
specimens
whilst
the
boys
were
at
school
but
they
came
home
at
christmas
devoted
body
and
soul
to
the
drama
we
were
soon
converted
to
the
new
fad
the
wardrobe
became
a
in
our
theatre
and
eleanor
and
clement
laboured
day
and
night
with
papers
of
powdered
paint
and
kettles
of
hot
size
in
converting
canvas
into
scenery
theatricals
promised
to
be
a
lasting
fancy
but
the
next
holidays
were
in
fine
weather
and
we
made
the
into
a
tent
when
the
boys
were
at
school
eleanor
and
i
were
fully
occupied
we
took
a
good
deal
of
pains
with
our
room
half
of
it
was
mine
now
i
had
my
table
as
well
as
eleanor
my
own
books
and
pictures
my
own
photographs
of
the
boys
and
of
the
dear
boys
my
own
pot
plants
and
my
own
dog
a
pug
given
to
me
by
jack
and
named
saucebox
in
absence
pincher
also
looked
on
me
as
his
mistress
like
most
other
conscientious
girls
we
had
rules
and
regulations
of
our
own
devising
private
codes
generally
kept
in
cipher
for
our
own
personal
and
laws
common
to
us
both
for
the
employment
of
our
time
in
joint
duties
lessons
parish
work
and
so
forth
i
think
we
made
rather
too
many
rules
and
that
we
them
too
often
i
make
fewer
now
and
easier
ones
and
let
them
much
more
alone
i
wonder
if
i
really
keep
them
better
but
if
not
may
god
i
pray
him
send
me
back
the
restless
zeal
the
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
which
he
gives
in
early
youth
it
is
so
easy
to
become
more
in
conscience
more
tolerant
of
evil
more
hopeless
of
good
more
careful
of
one
own
comfort
and
one
own
property
more
in
leaving
high
aims
and
great
deeds
to
enthusiasts
and
then
to
believe
that
one
is
growing
older
and
wiser
and
yet
those
high
examples
those
good
works
those
great
triumphs
over
evil
which
single
hands
effect
sometimes
we
are
all
grateful
for
when
they
are
done
whatever
we
may
have
said
of
the
doing
but
we
speak
of
saints
and
enthusiasts
for
good
as
if
some
special
gifts
were
made
to
them
in
middle
age
which
are
withheld
from
other
men
is
it
not
rather
that
some
few
souls
keep
alive
the
lamp
of
zeal
and
high
desire
which
god
lights
for
most
of
us
while
life
is
young
eleanor
and
i
worked
at
our
lessons
by
ourselves
we
always
had
her
mother
to
fall
back
upon
as
we
said
when
we
took
up
the
study
of
italian
in
order
to
be
able
to
read
dante
moved
thereto
by
the
attractions
of
the
long
volume
of
flaxman
illustrations
of
the
commedia
we
had
to
fall
back
a
good
deal
on
scholarship
and
this
in
spite
of
all
the
helps
the
library
afforded
us
the
best
of
dictionaries
english
cribs
and
about
six
of
those
elaborate
commentaries
upon
the
poem
of
which
italians
have
been
so
prolific
during
the
winter
the
study
of
languages
was
commonly
uppermost
in
summer
sketching
was
more
favoured
i
do
think
sketching
brings
one
a
larger
amount
of
pleasure
than
almost
any
other
occupation
and
like
collecting
it
is
a
very
sociable
pursuit
when
one
has
as
well
as
and
this
i
must
confess
is
a
merit
in
my
eyes
i
being
of
a
sociable
disposition
eleanor
could
live
alone
i
think
and
be
happy
but
i
depend
largely
on
my
jack
and
i
were
talking
rather
sentimentally
the
other
day
about
old
times
and
i
said
how
jolly
it
was
that
summer
we
used
to
sketch
so
much
all
four
of
us
together
and
jack
who
was
rubbing
some
new
stuff
of
his
own
compounding
into
his
replied
awfully
i
vote
we
take
to
it
again
when
the
weather
warmer
but
jack
is
so
sympathetic
he
will
agree
with
anything
one
says
indeed
i
am
sure
that
he
feels
what
one
feels
for
the
time
at
any
rate
clement
is
very
different
he
always
disputes
and
often
snubs
what
one
says
partly
i
am
sure
from
a
love
of
truth
a
genuine
desire
to
keep
himself
and
everybody
else
from
talking
in
an
unreal
way
and
from
repeating
common
ideas
without
thinking
them
out
at
first
hand
and
partly
too
from
what
keziah
calls
the
contradictiousness
of
his
temper
he
was
in
the
room
when
jack
and
i
were
talking
but
he
was
not
talking
with
us
he
was
reading
for
his
examination
all
the
arkwrights
can
work
through
noise
and
in
company
having
considerable
powers
of
mental
abstraction
i
think
they
even
sometimes
combine
attention
to
their
own
work
with
an
occasional
skimming
of
the
topics
current
in
the
room
as
well
some
outlying
feeler
of
clement
brain
caught
my
remark
and
reply
my
dear
margery
said
he
you
are
at
heart
one
of
the
most
unaffected
people
i
know
pray
be
equally
genuine
with
your
head
and
do
not
encourage
jack
in
his
slipshod
habits
of
thought
and
conversation
by
slipshod
interrupted
jack
holding
his
left
arm
out
at
full
length
before
him
the
hand
of
which
was
shod
with
a
slipshod
they
fit
as
close
as
your
convictions
and
would
be
as
stiff
and
inexorable
as
logic
if
i
did
soften
them
with
this
and
ointment
by
the
warmth
of
a
cheerful
fire
and
margery
beaming
countenance
clement
had
been
reading
during
this
sentence
then
he
lifted
his
head
and
said
pointedly
what
i
was
going
to
advise
margery
is
never
to
get
into
the
habit
of
adopting
sentiments
till
you
are
quite
sure
you
really
mean
them
it
is
by
the
painful
experience
of
my
own
folly
that
i
know
what
trouble
it
gives
one
afterwards
if
ever
the
time
comes
when
you
want
to
know
your
real
opinion
on
any
subject
the
process
of
getting
rid
of
ideas
you
have
adopted
without
meaning
them
will
not
be
an
easy
one
i
am
not
as
intellectual
as
the
arkwrights
i
can
always
see
through
jack
jokes
but
i
am
sometimes
left
far
behind
when
eleanor
or
clement
take
flight
as
jack
calls
it
on
serious
subjects
i
really
did
not
follow
clement
on
this
occasion
with
some
hesitation
i
said
i
do
know
that
i
quite
understand
i
sure
you
do
said
jack
i
have
feared
for
some
time
that
your
hair
was
getting
too
thick
for
the
finer
ideas
of
this
household
to
penetrate
to
your
brain
allow
me
to
apply
a
little
of
this
ointment
to
the
parting
which
in
your
case
is
more
definite
than
with
eleanor
and
as
our
lightest
actions
should
proceed
from
principles
i
may
mention
that
the
principle
on
which
i
propose
to
apply
the
to
your
scalp
is
that
on
which
the
blacksmith
wife
gave
your
cholera
medicine
to
the
second
girl
when
she
began
with
rheumatic
fever
did
such
a
deal
of
good
to
our
william
now
this
unguent
has
done
deal
of
good
to
the
leather
of
my
boots
why
should
it
not
successfully
lubricate
the
skin
of
your
skull
only
the
dread
of
a
row
between
jack
and
clem
enabled
me
to
keep
anything
like
gravity
do
talk
nonsense
jack
said
i
as
severely
as
i
could
i
fear
that
like
the
rest
of
the
world
i
snubbed
jack
rather
than
clement
because
his
temper
was
sweeter
and
less
likely
to
resent
it
clement
i
very
stupid
but
i
do
quite
see
how
what
said
applies
to
what
said
you
said
happy
we
were
that
summer
we
went
sketching
or
words
to
that
effect
it
just
like
a
man
writing
about
the
careless
happiness
of
childhood
when
he
either
forgets
or
refuses
to
advert
to
the
toothache
the
measles
learning
his
letters
the
heat
of
the
not
being
allowed
to
sit
down
in
the
yard
whilst
his
knickerbockers
were
new
going
to
bed
at
eight
and
having
a
lie
on
his
conscience
i
have
striven
for
more
accurate
habits
of
thought
and
i
remember
distinctly
that
you
cried
over
more
than
one
of
your
sketches
i
got
into
the
album
with
mine
however
said
jack
and
i
defy
an
to
have
had
more
difficulty
in
securing
his
position
i
afraid
your
appearance
in
the
was
better
deserved
said
arkwright
without
removing
her
eye
from
the
microscope
she
was
using
at
a
table
just
opposite
to
clem
but
this
demands
explanation
and
i
must
go
back
to
the
time
of
which
jack
and
i
spoke
when
we
used
to
go
sketching
together
chapter
xxv
the
household
album
sketching
under
difficulties
a
new
species
jack
bargain
theories
out
of
motherly
affection
and
also
because
their
early
attempts
at
drawing
were
very
clever
arkwright
had
years
before
begun
a
scrapbook
or
household
album
as
it
was
called
into
which
she
pasted
such
of
her
children
original
drawings
as
were
held
good
enough
for
the
honour
the
age
of
the
artist
being
taken
into
account
jack
gift
in
this
line
was
not
as
great
as
that
of
clement
or
eleanor
but
this
was
not
the
only
reason
why
no
drawing
of
his
appeared
in
the
scrapbook
arkwright
demanded
more
evidence
of
pains
and
industry
than
jack
was
wont
to
bestow
on
his
sketches
or
designs
he
resented
his
exclusion
and
made
many
efforts
to
induce
his
mother
to
accept
his
hasty
productions
but
it
was
not
till
the
summer
to
which
i
alluded
that
jack
took
his
place
in
the
household
album
it
was
during
a
long
drive
in
which
we
were
exhibiting
the
country
to
some
friends
that
eleanor
and
i
chose
the
place
of
that
particular
sketching
expedition
the
views
it
furnished
had
the
first
and
almost
the
only
quality
demanded
by
young
and
tyro
sketchers
they
were
very
pretty
there
was
some
variety
too
to
justify
our
choice
from
the
sandy
road
where
a
heathery
bank
afforded
the
convenience
of
seats
we
could
look
down
into
a
valley
with
a
winding
stream
whose
banks
rose
into
hillsides
which
lost
themselves
in
mountains
of
moorland
farther
on
a
scramble
on
foot
over
walls
and
gates
had
led
us
into
a
wooded
gorge
fringed
with
ferns
where
a
group
of
trees
of
particularly
graceful
form
roused
eleanor
admiration
what
a
lovely
view
had
burst
from
the
lips
of
our
friends
at
every
quarter
of
a
mile
for
they
were
of
that
to
me
trying
order
of
carriage
companions
who
talk
about
the
scenery
as
you
go
as
a
point
of
politeness
but
the
views
beautiful
sketches
everywhere
we
cried
there
nothing
to
make
a
sketch
round
the
vicarage
we
added
we
done
the
church
with
the
deadmanstone
hills
behind
it
and
without
the
deadmanstone
hills
behind
it
till
we
are
sick
of
the
subject
so
the
weather
being
fine
and
even
hot
we
provided
ourselves
with
luncheon
and
sketching
materials
and
made
an
expedition
to
the
point
we
had
selected
we
were
tired
by
the
time
we
reached
it
this
does
not
necessarily
damp
one
sketching
ardour
but
it
is
unfavourable
to
accuracy
of
outline
and
especially
so
to
purity
of
colouring
however
we
did
not
hesitate
eleanor
went
down
to
her
study
of
in
the
gorge
clement
climbed
up
the
bank
to
get
the
most
extended
view
of
the
ewden
valley
i
contented
myself
with
sitting
by
the
roadside
in
front
of
the
same
view
and
jack
stayed
with
me
he
had
come
with
us
not
that
he
often
went
out
sketching
but
our
descriptions
of
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
had
roused
him
to
make
another
attempt
for
the
household
album
seldom
lastingly
provided
for
his
own
part
with
apparatus
of
any
kind
jack
had
a
genius
for
purveying
all
that
he
required
in
an
emergency
on
this
occasion
he
had
borrowed
arkwright
without
leave
and
was
by
no
means
ill
supplied
with
pencils
and
brushes
which
certainly
were
not
his
own
he
had
hastily
stripped
a
couple
of
sheets
from
my
block
whilst
i
was
dressing
and
with
these
materials
he
seated
himself
on
that
side
of
me
which
enabled
him
to
dip
into
my
and
began
to
paint
not
through
my
outline
i
was
just
beginning
to
realize
the
complexities
of
a
view
with
your
middle
distance
in
a
valley
and
your
foreground
sloping
steeply
upwards
to
your
feet
when
jack
washing
out
a
large
dyed
sable
in
my
pot
with
an
amount
of
splashing
that
savoured
of
triumph
said
done
i
paused
in
a
vigorous
mental
effort
to
put
aside
my
of
the
relative
sizes
of
objects
and
to
that
a
top
stone
of
my
foreground
wall
covered
three
fields
the
river
and
half
the
bank
beyond
i
exclaimed
jack
put
his
brush
into
his
mouth
in
defiance
of
all
rules
and
deliberately
sucked
it
dry
then
he
waved
his
sketch
before
my
eyes
the
effect
rather
good
i
confessed
but
oh
jack
it
out
of
all
proportion
that
gate
really
looks
as
big
as
the
whole
valley
and
the
hills
beyond
the
top
of
the
ought
to
be
up
in
the
sky
it
would
look
beastly
ugly
if
it
was
replied
he
complacently
you
got
a
very
good
tint
for
those
hills
but
the
foreground
is
mere
scrambling
oh
jack
do
finish
it
a
little
more
you
would
draw
so
nicely
if
you
had
any
patience
how
imperfectly
you
understand
my
character
said
jack
packing
up
his
traps
i
would
sit
on
a
monument
and
smile
at
grief
with
any
one
this
very
day
if
the
monument
were
in
a
grove
or
even
if
i
had
an
umbrella
to
smile
under
to
sit
unsheltered
under
this
roasting
sun
and
make
myself
giddy
by
gauging
proportions
with
a
pencil
at
the
end
of
my
nose
or
smudging
my
mistakes
with
melting
is
quite
another
matter
i
off
to
eleanor
i
got
another
sheet
of
paper
and
i
think
trees
are
rather
in
my
line
i
my
block
looked
smaller
said
i
rapidly
comparing
paper
and
my
own
with
a
feeling
for
size
developed
by
my
labours
has
she
got
a
asked
jack
she
is
sure
to
have
said
i
pointedly
she
always
takes
her
own
materials
with
her
how
fortunate
for
those
who
do
not
said
jack
now
margery
dear
do
look
sulky
i
knew
you
would
grudge
me
a
bit
of
paper
to
get
into
the
album
with
come
down
into
the
ravine
you
as
white
as
a
blank
sheet
of
whatman
paper
the
increasing
heat
was
really
beginning
to
overpower
me
but
i
refused
to
leave
my
sketch
jack
pinned
a
large
white
to
my
shoulders
to
keep
the
sun
from
the
spine
and
departed
to
the
ravine
by
midday
my
outline
was
in
one
is
no
good
judge
of
one
own
work
but
i
think
on
the
whole
that
it
was
a
success
it
is
always
refreshing
to
complete
a
stage
of
anything
i
began
to
feel
less
hot
and
tired
as
i
passed
a
wash
of
clean
water
over
my
outline
and
laying
it
in
the
sun
to
dry
got
out
my
colours
and
brushes
as
i
did
so
one
of
the
little
gusts
of
wind
which
had
been
an
unpleasant
feature
of
this
very
fine
day
and
which
threatening
a
change
of
weather
made
us
anxious
to
finish
our
sketches
at
a
sitting
came
down
the
sandy
road
in
an
instant
the
damp
surface
of
my
block
looked
rough
enough
to
strike
matches
on
but
impatience
is
not
my
besetting
sin
and
i
had
endured
these
little
catastrophes
before
i
waited
for
the
block
to
dry
before
i
brushed
off
the
sand
i
also
waited
till
the
little
beetle
who
had
crept
into
my
sky
and
was
impeded
in
his
pace
by
my
first
wash
walked
slowly
down
through
all
my
distances
and
quitted
the
block
by
the
gate
in
the
foreground
this
was
partly
because
i
did
not
want
to
hurt
him
and
partly
because
a
white
cumulus
cloud
is
a
bad
part
of
your
sketch
to
kill
a
black
beetle
on
i
washed
over
my
paper
once
more
and
holding
it
on
my
knee
to
dry
just
as
much
and
no
more
than
was
desirable
i
looked
my
subject
in
the
face
with
a
view
to
colour
a
long
time
passed
i
had
looked
and
looked
again
i
had
washed
in
and
washed
out
i
had
realized
the
difficulty
of
the
subject
without
flinching
and
had
tried
hard
to
see
and
represent
the
colouring
before
me
when
clement
having
exhausted
his
water
in
a
similar
process
came
down
the
hill
behind
me
with
a
surly
and
sunburnt
face
to
replenish
his
bottle
at
a
wayside
it
was
then
that
as
he
said
he
found
me
crying
it
not
because
it
difficult
and
i
very
stupid
i
whimpered
i
do
mind
working
on
and
trying
to
make
the
best
of
a
thing
and
not
the
wind
or
the
sand
though
it
has
got
dreadfully
into
the
paints
particularly
the
italian
pink
but
what
makes
me
hopeless
clement
is
that
i
do
believe
it
would
look
well
if
i
could
paint
it
perfectly
it
looked
lovely
as
we
were
driving
home
the
other
evening
but
now
just
look
at
those
fields
clem
i
they
green
but
really
and
truly
i
them
just
the
same
colour
as
this
road
and
i
do
think
there
is
the
difference
of
a
shade
between
them
and
that
what
shall
i
do
a
tear
fell
out
of
my
eyelashes
and
dropped
on
to
my
river
clement
took
the
sketch
from
me
and
dried
up
the
tear
with
a
bit
of
then
to
my
amazement
he
gave
rather
a
favourable
verdict
it
comforted
me
for
clement
never
says
anything
that
he
does
not
mean
it
not
bad
margery
wait
till
you
see
mine
how
did
you
get
the
tints
of
that
hillside
you
a
very
truthful
mind
that
one
thing
and
a
very
true
eye
as
well
i
do
admire
the
way
you
abstain
from
filling
up
with
touches
that
mean
nothing
oh
clement
cried
i
so
gratified
that
i
began
to
feel
ready
to
go
on
again
do
you
really
think
i
can
make
anything
of
it
nothing
more
said
clement
do
put
another
touch
it
unfinished
but
no
finishing
would
do
any
good
we
got
an
outlandish
subject
and
a
bad
time
of
day
but
keep
it
just
as
it
is
and
three
months
hence
on
a
cool
day
you
be
pleased
when
you
look
at
it
perhaps
if
i
went
on
a
little
with
the
foreground
i
suggested
but
even
as
i
spoke
i
put
my
hand
to
my
head
go
to
eleanor
in
the
ravine
at
once
said
clement
imperatively
bring
your
things
what
make
us
such
fools
as
to
come
out
without
umbrellas
we
came
out
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
said
i
as
i
staggered
off
besides
it
almost
impossible
to
hold
one
and
paint
too
once
in
the
ravine
i
dropped
among
the
long
grass
and
ferns
and
the
damp
refreshing
coolness
of
my
was
delicious
eleanor
was
not
faint
neither
had
she
been
crying
but
she
was
not
much
happier
with
her
sketch
than
i
had
been
with
mine
the
jutting
group
of
was
well
chosen
and
she
had
drawn
them
admirably
but
when
she
came
to
add
the
confused
background
of
trees
and
undergrowth
her
very
outline
had
begun
to
look
less
satisfactory
when
it
came
to
colour
and
the
midday
sun
was
darting
and
glittering
through
the
interstices
of
the
trees
without
supplying
any
effects
of
to
a
subject
already
defective
in
point
and
contrast
eleanor
was
almost
in
despair
where
jack
said
i
after
condoling
with
her
he
tried
the
birches
for
ten
minutes
and
then
he
went
up
the
stream
to
look
for
at
this
moment
jack
appeared
he
came
slowly
towards
us
looking
at
something
in
his
hand
lend
me
your
eleanor
said
he
when
he
had
reached
us
eleanor
unfastened
it
from
her
chatelaine
and
jack
became
absorbed
in
examining
some
in
a
what
is
it
said
we
it
a
new
species
i
believe
look
eleanor
and
he
gave
her
the
leaf
and
the
glass
with
an
almost
pathetic
anxiety
of
countenance
my
opinion
carried
no
weight
in
the
matter
but
eleanor
was
nearly
as
good
a
naturalist
as
her
mother
and
she
was
inclined
to
agree
with
jack
it
too
good
to
be
true
but
i
certainly
do
know
it
where
did
you
find
it
no
thank
you
said
jack
derisively
i
mean
to
keep
the
habitat
to
myself
for
the
present
for
very
good
margery
my
child
put
that
sketch
of
mine
into
the
pocket
of
your
block
the
paper
is
much
about
the
size
of
your
own
it
is
going
into
the
album
we
went
home
earlier
than
we
had
intended
even
the
perseverance
of
eleanor
and
clement
broke
down
under
their
jack
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
and
with
his
usual
he
tried
hard
to
infect
me
with
his
cheerfulness
i
think
said
i
looking
dolefully
at
my
sketch
that
a
good
deal
of
the
fault
must
have
been
in
my
eyes
i
suspect
one
ca
see
colours
properly
when
one
is
feeling
sick
and
giddy
but
the
glare
of
the
sun
was
the
worst
i
could
tell
red
from
green
on
my
palette
so
no
wonder
the
fields
and
everything
else
looked
all
the
same
colour
and
yet
what
provokes
one
is
the
feeling
that
an
artist
would
have
made
a
sketch
of
it
somehow
the
view
is
really
beautiful
and
that
is
really
beautiful
said
eleanor
pointing
to
the
birch
group
and
its
background
and
what
a
mess
i
have
made
of
it
i
wish
stuck
to
pencil
and
yet
as
you
say
an
artist
would
have
got
a
picture
out
of
it
i
tell
you
what
said
jack
who
was
lying
face
downwards
with
my
picture
spread
before
him
i
believe
that
any
one
who
knew
the
dodges
when
he
saw
that
everything
looked
one
pale
yellowish
brownish
tint
with
the
glare
of
the
sun
would
have
boldly
taken
a
weak
wash
of
all
the
colours
in
his
box
right
over
everything
picked
out
a
few
stones
in
his
foreground
wall
dodged
in
a
few
shadows
and
so
on
and
made
a
clever
sketch
of
it
and
the
same
with
eleanor
if
he
had
got
his
half
as
good
as
hers
and
had
then
seen
what
a
muddle
the
trees
behind
were
in
i
believe
he
would
only
have
washed
in
a
little
blue
and
grey
behind
the
birches
as
our
old
at
school
calls
it
a
distant
stem
or
two
and
there
would
have
been
another
clever
sketch
for
you
another
clever
falsehood
you
mean
said
clement
hotly
to
ruin
people
taste
and
encourage
idle
painters
in
showy
trickery
and
make
them
believe
they
can
improve
upon
nature
colouring
nature
colouring
varies
said
jack
distant
trees
often
blue
and
grey
though
these
just
now
are
of
the
rankest
green
clement
replied
jack
responded
clement
retorted
and
a
fierce
raged
the
whole
way
home
we
were
well
used
to
it
indeed
all
conversations
with
us
had
a
tendency
to
become
controversial
over
and
above
which
there
was
truth
in
keziah
saying
the
young
gentlemen
fit
to
deave
a
body
head
and
dear
knows
what
it
all
about
clement
finished
a
vehement
and
rather
didactic
confession
of
his
as
we
climbed
the
steep
hill
to
the
vicarage
the
keynote
of
it
was
that
one
ought
to
draw
what
he
sees
exactly
as
he
sees
it
and
that
every
subject
has
a
beauty
of
its
own
which
he
ought
to
perceive
if
his
perception
is
not
emasculated
by
an
acquired
taste
for
prettinesses
i
shall
be
in
the
album
this
evening
said
jack
in
deliberate
tones
my
next
ambition
is
the
society
of
painters
in
water
colours
the
subject
of
my
first
painting
is
settled
three
grass
fields
haymaking
over
the
day
before
yesterday
a
wall
in
front
of
the
first
field
a
hedge
in
front
of
the
second
a
wall
in
front
of
the
third
a
gate
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
a
spotted
pig
in
the
middle
of
the
field
the
sun
at
its
meridian
the
pig
asleep
motto
is
is
beautiful
eleanor
and
i
in
the
interests
of
peace
hastened
to
change
the
subject
by
ridiculing
jack
complacent
conviction
that
his
sketch
would
be
accepted
for
the
household
album
and
yet
it
was
the
jack
had
been
lucky
enough
to
find
was
a
new
species
and
threw
arkwright
and
eleanor
into
a
state
of
the
highest
excitement
but
all
their
entreaties
failed
to
persuade
jack
to
disclose
the
secret
of
the
habitat
put
my
sketch
into
the
album
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
said
he
arkwright
held
out
against
this
for
then
she
gave
way
jack
sketch
was
gummed
in
it
took
up
a
whole
page
being
the
full
size
of
my
block
and
he
told
us
all
about
the
it
was
described
and
figured
in
the
and
received
the
specific
name
of
and
jack
double
triumph
was
complete
we
were
very
glad
for
his
success
but
it
almost
increased
the
sense
of
disappointment
that
our
share
of
the
expedition
had
been
so
unlucky
it
seems
such
a
waste
said
i
to
have
got
to
such
a
lovely
place
with
one
drawing
things
and
plenty
of
time
and
to
come
away
without
a
sketch
worth
keeping
at
the
end
just
because
one
does
know
the
right
way
of
working
i
think
there
a
good
deal
in
what
jack
said
about
your
sketch
said
eleanor
and
i
think
if
one
looked
at
the
way
real
artists
have
treated
similar
subjects
and
then
went
at
it
again
and
tried
to
do
it
on
a
similar
principle
if
ever
we
do
go
there
again
clement
interrupted
but
i
suppose
we
shall
these
holidays
and
the
way
summer
after
summer
slips
away
is
awful
i
more
and
more
convinced
that
it
a
great
mistake
to
have
so
many
hobbies
no
life
is
long
enough
for
more
than
one
pursuit
and
it
ten
to
one
you
die
in
the
middle
of
mastering
that
one
is
sure
to
die
in
the
early
stages
of
clement
is
very
apt
to
develop
some
odd
theory
of
this
kind
and
to
preach
it
with
a
severity
that
borders
on
gloom
i
never
know
what
to
say
even
if
i
disagree
with
him
but
eleanor
takes
up
the
cudgels
at
once
i
do
think
i
agree
with
you
she
said
giving
a
shove
to
her
soft
elastic
hair
which
did
not
improve
the
indefiniteness
of
the
parting
of
course
it
unsatisfactory
in
one
way
to
feel
one
will
never
live
to
finish
things
but
in
another
way
i
think
it
a
great
comfort
to
feel
one
can
never
use
them
up
or
outlive
them
if
one
lasts
on
to
be
a
hundred
and
though
one
gets
very
cross
and
miserable
with
failing
so
over
things
one
works
at
i
do
know
whether
one
would
be
so
much
happier
when
one
was
at
the
top
of
the
tree
i
not
sure
that
the
chief
pleasure
is
actually
in
the
working
at
things
i
mean
in
the
drudgery
of
learning
rather
than
in
the
triumph
of
having
learnt
there
something
in
that
said
clement
and
it
was
a
great
deal
for
clement
to
say
it
does
not
take
much
to
convert
to
eleanor
views
of
anything
but
i
do
think
experience
bears
out
what
she
said
about
this
matter
perhaps
that
accounts
for
my
having
a
happy
remembrance
of
old
times
when
we
worked
at
things
together
even
if
we
failed
and
cried
over
them
i
know
that
practically
now
i
would
willingly
join
the
others
in
going
at
anything
though
i
could
not
promise
not
to
be
peevish
over
my
own
stupidity
sometimes
and
if
i
was
very
much
tired
i
do
think
there
was
anything
untrue
in
my
calling
the
times
we
went
sketching
together
happy
times
in
spite
of
what
clement
says
but
he
does
rule
such
very
straight
lines
all
over
life
and
i
sometimes
think
one
may
rule
them
too
straight
even
for
full
truth

clique
the
lessons
of
experience
out
visiting
dressmaking
eleanor
and
i
were
not
always
at
home
we
generally
went
visiting
somewhere
at
least
once
a
year
i
think
it
was
good
for
us
great
as
were
the
advantages
of
the
life
i
now
shared
over
an
existence
wasted
in
a
petty
round
of
ignoble
gossip
and
social
struggle
it
had
the
drawback
of
being
almost
too
perhaps
i
am
not
certain
a
little
too
laborious
i
do
think
but
for
me
it
must
at
any
rate
have
become
the
latter
i
am
so
much
less
industrious
energetic
clever
and
good
in
every
way
than
eleanor
for
one
thing
that
my
very
idleness
holds
us
back
and
i
think
a
taste
for
gaiety
i
simply
mean
being
gay
not
balls
and
parties
and
for
social
pleasure
and
for
pretty
things
and
graceful
situations
runs
in
my
veins
with
my
french
blood
and
helps
to
break
the
current
of
our
labours
we
led
lives
of
considerable
intellectual
activity
constant
occupation
and
engrossing
interest
we
were
apt
to
foy
at
our
work
to
the
extent
of
grudging
and
sleep
indeed
at
one
time
a
habit
obtained
with
us
of
leaving
the
table
in
turn
as
we
finished
our
respective
meals
one
member
of
the
family
after
another
would
rise
bend
his
or
her
head
for
a
silent
grace
and
depart
to
the
work
in
hand
i
have
known
the
table
gradually
deserted
in
this
fashion
till
arkwright
was
left
alone
i
remember
going
back
one
day
into
the
room
and
seeing
him
so
my
entrance
partially
aroused
him
from
a
brown
study
he
was
at
all
times
very
absent
he
rose
said
grace
aloud
for
the
benefit
of
the
company
which
had
dispersed
and
withdrew
to
his
library
but
we
abolished
this
uncivilized
custom
in
conclave
and
thenceforth
sat
our
meals
out
to
the
end
so
free
were
we
in
our
isolation
upon
those
yorkshire
moors
from
the
trammels
of
conventionality
one
might
almost
say
civilization
that
i
think
we
should
have
come
to
begrudge
the
ordinary
interchange
of
the
neighbourly
courtesies
of
life
but
for
occasional
lectures
from
arkwright
and
for
going
out
visiting
from
time
to
time
it
was
not
merely
that
a
life
of
running
in
and
out
of
other
houses
and
chatting
the
same
bits
of
news
threadbare
with
one
acquaintance
after
another
as
at
riflebury
would
have
been
unendurable
by
us
the
rare
arrival
of
a
visitor
from
some
distant
to
call
at
the
vicarage
was
the
signal
for
every
one
who
could
do
so
with
decency
to
escape
from
the
unwelcome
interruption
but
as
we
grew
older
arkwright
would
not
allow
this
the
boys
indeed
were
hard
to
coerce
they
bolted
still
when
the
rang
but
domestic
authority
which
is
apt
to
be
magnified
on
the
girls
overruled
eleanor
and
me
for
our
good
and
her
mother
who
reasoned
with
us
far
more
than
she
commanded
convinced
us
of
how
much
selfishness
there
was
in
this
as
in
all
acts
of
discourtesy
but
what
do
we
not
owe
to
her
good
counsels
in
how
many
evening
talks
has
she
not
warned
us
of
the
follies
affectations
or
troubles
to
which
our
lives
might
specially
be
liable
against
despising
interests
that
are
not
our
own
or
graces
which
we
have
chosen
to
neglect
against
the
danger
of
satire
against
the
love
or
the
fear
of
being
thought
singular
and
above
all
against
the
petty
pride
of
clique
i
do
not
know
which
is
the
worst
i
remember
her
saying
a
religious
clique
an
intellectual
clique
a
fashionable
clique
a
moneyed
clique
or
a
family
clique
and
i
have
seen
them
all
come
mother
said
eleanor
you
can
not
persuade
us
you
would
not
have
more
sympathy
with
the
intellectual
than
the
moneyed
clique
for
instance
i
should
have
warmly
declared
so
myself
at
one
time
said
arkwright
but
i
have
a
vivid
remembrance
of
a
man
belonging
to
an
artistic
clique
to
whose
house
i
once
went
with
some
friends
my
friends
were
artists
also
but
their
minds
were
enlarged
instead
of
being
narrowed
by
one
chief
pursuit
their
special
art
gave
them
sympathy
with
all
others
as
the
high
cultivation
of
one
virtue
is
said
to
bring
all
the
rest
in
its
train
but
this
man
talked
the
shibboleth
of
his
craft
over
one
head
to
other
members
of
his
clique
with
a
defiance
of
good
manners
arising
more
from
conceit
than
from
ignorance
of
the
ways
of
society
and
with
a
transparent
intention
of
being
overheard
and
admired
which
reminded
me
of
the
little
conceits
of
children
before
visitors
he
was
one
of
a
large
family
with
the
same
peculiarities
joined
to
a
devout
admiration
of
each
other
indeed
they
combined
the
artistic
clique
and
the
family
clique
in
equal
proportions
from
the
conversation
at
their
table
you
would
have
imagined
that
there
was
but
one
standard
of
good
for
poor
humanity
that
of
one
of
one
art
and
absolutely
no
one
who
quite
came
up
to
it
but
the
brothers
sisters
parents
cousins
or
connections
by
marriage
of
your
host
now
i
honestly
assure
you
that
the
only
other
man
really
like
this
one
that
i
ever
met
was
what
is
called
a
man
in
a
commercial
clique
money
was
standard
and
he
seemed
to
be
as
completely
unembarrassed
as
my
artist
friend
by
the
weight
of
any
other
ideas
than
his
own
or
by
any
feeling
short
of
utter
satisfaction
with
himself
their
contempt
for
the
conventionalities
of
society
was
about
equal
my
artist
friend
had
passed
a
sweeping
criticism
for
my
benefit
now
and
then
there
could
be
no
conversation
where
no
second
opinion
was
allowed
and
it
was
with
perhaps
a
shade
less
of
condescension
a
shade
more
of
friendliness
that
my
commercial
friend
once
stopped
some
remarks
of
mine
with
the
knowing
observation
here
whenever
i
hear
this
that
and
the
other
bragged
about
a
party
what
i
always
say
is
this
i
do
want
you
to
tell
me
what
he
but
what
he
eleanor
and
i
laughed
merrily
at
the
anecdote
even
if
we
were
not
quite
converted
to
arkwright
views
and
i
must
in
justice
add
that
every
visit
which
has
taken
us
from
home
every
fresh
experience
which
has
enlarged
our
knowledge
of
the
world
has
confirmed
the
truth
of
her
sage
and
practical
advice
if
at
home
we
have
still
inclined
to
feel
it
almost
a
duty
to
be
proud
of
intellectual
tastes
quite
a
duty
to
be
proud
of
orthodox
opinions
and
at
the
worst
a
very
amiable
weakness
indeed
to
think
that
there
are
no
boys
like
our
boys
a
wholesome
experience
of
having
other
people
tastes
and
views
crammed
down
our
throats
has
modified
our
ideas
in
this
respect
a
strong
dose
of
eulogistic
biography
of
the
brothers
of
a
gushing
acquaintance
made
the
names
of
clem
and
jack
sacred
to
our
domestic
circle
for
ever
and
what
i
have
endured
from
a
mangy
who
is
the
idol
of
a
lady
of
our
acquaintance
has
led
me
sometimes
to
wonder
if
visitors
at
the
vicarage
are
ever
oppressed
by
the
dear
boys
i
afraid
it
is
possible
poor
dear
things
i
have
positively
heard
people
say
that
saucebox
is
ugly
though
he
has
eyes
like
a
and
his
tongue
hangs
quite
six
inches
out
of
his
mouth
and
in
warm
weather
or
before
meals
further
still
however
i
keep
him
in
very
good
order
and
never
allow
him
to
be
troublesome
to
people
who
do
not
appreciate
him
for
i
have
observed
that
there
are
people
who
having
no
children
of
their
own
hold
very
just
and
severe
views
about
spoiled
boys
and
girls
but
who
having
dogs
of
their
own
are
much
less
on
the
subject
of
spoiled
terriers
and
pomeranians
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
like
that
dear
as
the
dear
boys
are
certainly
seeing
all
sorts
of
people
with
all
sorts
of
peculiarities
is
often
a
great
help
towards
trying
to
get
rid
of
one
own
objectionable
ones
but
like
the
sketching
one
sometimes
gets
into
despair
about
it
and
though
the
process
of
learning
an
art
may
be
even
pleasanter
than
to
feel
one
self
a
master
in
it
one
can
not
say
as
much
for
the
process
of
discovering
one
follies
i
should
like
to
get
rid
of
in
a
lump
eleanor
said
so
one
day
to
her
mother
but
arkwright
said
we
may
hate
ourselves
as
you
call
it
when
we
come
to
realize
failings
we
have
not
recognized
before
and
feel
that
there
are
probably
others
which
we
do
not
yet
see
as
clearly
as
other
people
see
them
but
this
kind
of
impatience
for
our
perfection
is
not
felt
by
those
who
love
us
i
am
sure
it
is
one
greatest
comfort
to
believe
that
it
is
not
even
felt
by
god
just
as
a
mother
would
not
love
her
child
the
better
for
its
being
turned
into
a
model
of
perfection
by
one
stroke
of
magic
but
does
love
it
the
more
dearly
every
time
it
tries
to
be
good
so
i
do
hope
and
believe
our
great
father
does
not
wait
for
us
to
be
good
and
wise
to
love
us
but
loves
us
and
loves
to
help
us
in
the
very
thick
of
our
struggles
with
folly
and
sin
but
i
am
becoming
as
discursive
as
ever
what
i
want
to
put
down
is
about
our
going
out
visiting
there
is
really
nothing
much
to
say
about
our
life
at
home
it
was
very
happy
but
there
were
no
great
events
in
it
and
eleanor
says
it
will
not
do
for
us
to
go
off
at
a
tangent
and
describe
what
happened
to
the
boys
at
school
and
college
first
because
these
biographies
are
merely
to
be
lives
of
our
own
selves
for
nobody
but
us
two
to
read
when
we
are
both
old
maids
and
secondly
because
if
we
put
down
everything
we
had
anything
to
do
with
in
these
ten
years
it
will
be
so
very
long
before
our
biographies
are
finished
we
are
very
anxious
to
see
them
done
partly
because
we
are
getting
rather
tired
of
them
and
jack
is
becoming
suspicious
and
partly
because
we
have
got
an
amateur
bookbinding
press
and
we
want
to
bind
them
well
as
i
said
we
paid
visits
to
relatives
of
mine
and
to
old
friends
of
the
arkwrights
my
friends
invited
eleanor
and
eleanor
friends
invited
me
people
are
very
kind
and
it
was
understood
that
we
were
happier
together
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
myself
possessed
of
some
charming
cousins
living
in
a
cathedral
town
and
at
their
house
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
us
to
visit
the
cathedral
services
gave
us
great
delight
when
i
think
of
the
expression
of
eleanor
face
i
may
almost
say
rapture
then
there
was
a
certain
shop
in
the
town
which
had
manifold
attractions
for
us
every
parochial
want
that
print
and
paper
could
supply
was
there
met
with
a
convenience
that
bordered
on
luxury
there
was
a
good
store
too
of
sacred
prints
illuminated
texts
and
oak
frames
from
which
we
carried
back
sundry
additions
to
the
garnishing
of
our
room
besides
presents
for
jack
who
was
as
fond
of
such
things
as
we
were
parish
matters
were
naturally
of
perennial
interest
for
us
in
our
vicarage
home
but
if
ever
they
became
a
fad
it
was
about
this
period
but
it
was
to
a
completely
new
art
that
this
visit
finally
led
us
which
i
hardly
know
how
to
describe
unless
as
the
art
of
dressmaking
and
general
ornamentation
the
neighbourhood
abounded
with
pretty
clerical
and
country
homes
where
my
cousins
were
intimate
each
one
so
it
seemed
to
eleanor
and
me
prettier
than
the
last
sunshiny
and
homelike
with
irregular
comfortable
furniture
dainty
with
chintz
or
dark
with
aged
oak
each
room
more
tastefully
besprinkled
than
the
rest
with
old
china
new
books
music
sketches
needlework
and
flowers
do
you
know
eleanor
said
i
when
we
were
dressing
for
dinner
one
evening
before
a
that
had
been
tastefully
adorned
for
our
use
by
the
daughters
of
the
house
i
wonder
if
yorkshire
women
as
as
they
call
themselves
i
think
our
villagers
are
in
the
important
points
of
cleanliness
and
solid
comfort
and
of
course
we
are
at
the
vicarage
as
to
keziah
keeps
us
all
like
copper
kettles
but
do
you
think
we
might
have
a
little
more
about
tasteful
pretty
refinements
it
perhaps
is
rather
a
waste
of
time
arranging
all
these
vases
and
baskets
of
flowers
every
day
but
they
are
nice
to
look
at
and
i
think
it
civilizes
one
not
to
blame
said
eleanor
decisively
you
to
the
backbone
and
french
on
the
top
it
is
we
hard
folk
we
business
people
who
neglect
to
cultivate
beautiful
we
quite
wrong
but
i
think
the
beautiful
is
revenged
on
us
added
she
with
one
of
her
quick
bright
looks
by
withdrawing
itself
nothing
comparable
for
ugliness
to
the
people
of
a
manufacturing
town
my
mind
was
running
on
certain
very
ingenious
and
tasteful
methods
of
hanging
nosegays
on
the
wall
those
baskets
with
ferns
and
flowers
in
against
the
wall
were
lovely
were
they
said
i
do
you
think
we
shall
ever
be
able
to
think
of
such
pretty
things
we
not
fools
said
eleanor
briefly
we
shall
do
it
when
we
set
our
minds
to
it
meantime
we
must
make
notes
of
whatever
strikes
us
there
are
plenty
of
jolly
flowers
in
the
garden
at
home
said
i
it
was
a
polite
way
of
expressing
my
inward
regret
that
we
had
no
tropical
orchids
or
strange
and
eleanor
danced
round
me
and
improvised
a
song
beginning
there
are
ferns
by
ewden
waters
and
heather
on
the
hill
from
the
better
adornment
of
the
vicarage
to
the
better
adornment
of
ourselves
was
a
short
stride
most
of
the
young
ladies
in
these
country
homes
were
very
prettily
dressed
not
perowne
not
in
that
milliner
handbook
style
dear
to
promenades
and
places
of
public
resort
but
more
daintily
and
with
more
attention
to
the
prettiest
and
most
convenient
of
the
prevailing
fashions
than
eleanor
and
my
costumes
displayed
the
toilettes
of
one
young
lady
in
particular
won
our
admiration
and
when
we
learned
that
her
pretty
things
were
made
by
herself
an
overwhelming
ambition
seized
upon
us
to
learn
to
do
the
same
women
ought
to
know
about
all
house
matters
said
eleanor
puckering
her
brow
to
a
gloomy
extent
dressmaking
cookery
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
we
know
nothing
about
any
of
them
i
was
thinking
only
last
night
in
bed
that
if
i
were
cast
away
on
a
desert
island
and
had
to
make
a
dress
out
of
an
old
sail
i
should
have
the
ghost
of
an
idea
where
to
begin
i
should
said
i
i
should
sew
it
up
like
a
sack
make
three
holes
for
my
head
and
arms
and
tie
it
round
my
waist
with
ship
rope
i
could
manage
robinson
crusoe
dresses
it
the
civilized
ones
that
will
be
too
much
for
me
i
afraid
i
believe
the
sail
would
go
twice
as
far
if
we
could
gore
it
said
eleanor
laughing
but
there
no
waste
like
the
wastefulness
of
ignorance
and
oh
margery
it
the
i
afraid
of
if
skirts
were
only
made
the
way
like
a
flannel
petticoat
so
many
pieces
all
alike
run
them
together
hem
the
bottom
gather
the
top
and
there
you
are
with
everything
straightforward
but
the
pocket
to
our
surprise
we
found
that
our
new
fad
was
a
sore
subject
with
arkwright
she
reproached
herself
bitterly
with
having
given
eleanor
so
little
training
in
domestic
arts
but
she
had
been
brought
up
by
a
learned
uncle
who
considered
needlework
a
waste
of
time
and
she
knew
as
little
about
gores
as
we
did
she
had
also
unfortunately
known
or
heard
of
some
excellent
mother
who
had
trained
nine
daughters
to
such
perfection
of
domestic
capabilities
that
it
was
boasted
that
they
could
never
in
employ
a
workwoman
or
domestic
who
would
know
more
of
her
business
than
her
employer
and
this
good
lady
was
a
standing
trouble
to
poor
arkwright
conscience
her
were
needless
general
training
is
perhaps
quite
as
good
as
if
not
better
than
special
even
for
special
ends
in
giving
us
a
higher
education
in
teaching
us
to
use
our
eyes
our
wits
and
our
she
had
put
all
meaner
arts
within
our
grasp
when
need
should
urge
and
opportunity
serve
aunt
theresa
was
always
dressmaking
i
said
to
eleanor
but
i
remember
anything
that
would
help
us
i
was
so
young
you
know
and
when
one
is
young
one
is
so
stupid
one
really
resists
information
i
was
to
have
another
chance
however
of
gleaning
hints
from
aunt
theresa

came
home
again
colonel
quentin
had
retired
and
when
major
buller
got
the
regiment
he
also
left
the
army
and
settled
in
a
pleasant
neighbourhood
in
the
south
of
england
as
soon
as
aunt
theresa
was
fairly
established
in
her
new
house
she
sent
for
eleanor
and
me
there
was
no
idea
of
my
remaining
permanently
it
was
only
a
visit
the
major
but
he
was
a
colonel
now
and
his
wife
were
very
little
changed
the
girls
of
course
had
altered
greatly
and
so
had
matilda
was
a
young
lady
with
a
slightly
frail
appearance
at
times
as
if
nature
were
still
revenging
the
old
mismanagement
and
neglect
it
did
not
need
aunt
theresa
to
tell
us
that
she
was
her
favourite
daughter
but
it
was
no
capricious
favouritism
i
am
sure
i
believe
colonel
buller
to
have
been
one
of
those
people
whose
hearts
have
depths
of
tenderness
that
are
never
sounded
the
bush
house
catastrophe
had
long
ago
been
swept
into
the
of
aunt
theresa
memory
but
the
tender
of
matilda
father
was
still
to
be
seen
in
all
his
care
and
indulgence
of
her
he
take
me
anywhere
said
matilda
with
affectionate
pride
he
even
goes
shopping
with
me
we
liked
matilda
by
far
the
best
of
the
girls
partly
no
doubt
because
she
was
our
old
friend
but
partly
i
think
because
intimacy
with
her
father
had
developed
the
qualities
she
inherited
from
him
and
softened
others
to
our
great
satisfaction
we
discovered
that
gores
were
no
enigma
to
matilda
and
she
and
aunt
theresa
undertook
to
initiate
us
into
the
mysteries
of
dressmaking
there
was
an
excellent
opportunity
eleanor
was
now
eighteen
and
matilda
seventeen
years
old
matilda
was
to
come
out
at
a
county
ball
that
was
to
take
place
whilst
we
were
with
the
bullers
and
arkwright
consented
to
let
eleanor
go
also
hence
ball
dresses
and
hence
also
our
opportunity
for
learning
how
to
make
them
for
they
were
to
be
made
by
a
dressmaker
in
the
house
and
she
did
not
reject
our
assistance
the
bullers
was
divided
by
and
both
divisions
now
overflowed
with
tarlatan
and
trimmings
but
at
every
fresh
inroad
of
callers
and
they
were
hardly
less
frequent
than
of
old
we
young
ones
and
yards
of
flounces
and
finery
with
us
were
swept
by
aunt
theresa
into
the
back
like
autumn
leaves
before
a
breeze
the
dresses
were
very
successful
and
so
was
the
ball
i
was
so
anxious
to
hear
how
eleanor
had
sped
that
i
felt
quite
sure
that
i
could
not
go
to
sleep
and
that
it
was
a
farce
to
go
to
bed
just
when
she
was
beginning
to
dance
i
went
however
at
last
and
had
had
half
a
night
sound
sleep
before
rustling
and
chattering
and
the
light
from
woke
me
to
hear
the
news
matilda
was
looking
pale
and
somewhat
dishevelled
and
a
great
deal
of
the
costume
at
which
we
had
laboured
was
reduced
to
rags
dress
was
intact
and
she
herself
looked
perfectly
fresh
partly
because
she
had
resisted
with
great
difficulty
the
extreme
length
of
train
then
fashionable
and
partly
from
a
sort
of
general
compactness
which
seems
a
natural
gift
with
some
people
poor
matilda
had
nearly
fainted
after
one
of
the
dances
and
had
brought
away
a
violent
headache
but
she
declared
that
she
had
enjoyed
herself
and
would
have
stayed
to
relate
her
adventures
but
colonel
buller
would
not
allow
it
and
sent
her
to
bed
eleanor
slept
with
me
so
our
gossip
was
unopposed
except
by
warnings
i
set
fire
to
my
hair
in
the
effort
to
decipher
the
ball
card
but
we
put
it
out
and
the
candle
also
and
chatted
in
bed
you
must
have
danced
every
dance
i
said
admiringly
we
sat
out
one
or
two
that
are
down
said
eleanor
and
no
was
supper
but
i
danced
all
the
rest
there
was
one
man
you
danced
several
times
with
i
said
but
i
could
make
out
his
name
it
looks
as
if
it
began
with
a
oh
it
not
his
real
name
said
eleanor
it
the
one
he
says
you
used
to
call
him
by
one
reason
why
i
liked
him
margery
dear
was
because
he
said
he
had
been
so
fond
of
you
you
were
such
a
dear
little
thing
he
said
i
told
him
the
locket
and
chain
were
in
good
preservation
was
it
mr
george
i
cried
with
so
much
energy
that
aunt
theresa
who
slept
next
door
heard
us
and
knocked
on
the
wall
to
bid
us
go
to
sleep
we
just
going
to
eleanor
shouted
and
added
in
lower
tones
to
me
yes
it
was
captain
abercrombie
colonel
buller
introduced
him
to
me
he
is
so
nice
and
so
delightfully
fond
of
dogs
and
of
you
margery
shall
i
see
him
i
asked
i
should
like
to
see
him
again
he
was
very
good
to
me
when
i
was
little
oh
yes
said
eleanor
it
was
curious
his
being
in
the
neighbourhood
for
the
is
in
dublin
you
know
and
margery
he
says
he
has
an
uncle
in
yorkshire
he
girls
girls
cried
aunt
theresa
and
we
went
to
sleep
soon
after
we
returned
from
our
visit
to
the
bullers
eleanor
and
i
resolved
to
prove
the
benefit
we
had
reaped
from
aunt
instructions
by
making
ourselves
some
dresses
of
an
inexpensive
stuff
that
we
bought
for
the
purpose
how
well
i
remember
the
pattern
a
flowering
creeper
which
followed
a
light
stem
upwards
through
yard
after
yard
of
the
material
we
had
picked
to
pieces
certain
old
bodies
which
fitted
us
fairly
and
our
first
work
was
to
lay
these
patterns
upon
the
new
stuff
with
weights
on
them
and
so
to
cut
out
our
new
bodies
as
easily
as
matilda
whose
directions
we
were
following
had
prophesied
that
we
should
when
these
and
the
sleeves
were
accomplished
and
they
looked
most
we
began
upon
the
skirts
we
cut
the
back
and
the
front
breadths
and
duly
sloped
the
latter
then
came
the
gores
we
folded
the
breadths
into
three
parts
we
took
a
third
at
one
end
and
at
the
other
and
folded
the
slope
accordingly
it
became
quite
exciting
who
would
have
thought
it
was
so
easy
said
eleanor
was
almost
prone
upon
the
table
cutting
the
gores
with
large
scissors
which
made
a
thoroughly
squeak
the
higher
education
fades
from
my
view
with
every
snip
she
said
laughing
upon
my
word
margery
i
begin
to
believe
this
sort
of
thing
our
vocation
it
is
great
fun
and
there
is
absolutely
no
brain
wear
and
tear
the
gores
were
parted
as
she
spoke
and
to
do
us
justice
were
exactly
the
shape
of
the
tarlatan
ones
aunt
theresa
had
cut
but
when
we
came
to
put
them
together
they
would
fit
without
turning
one
of
them
the
wrong
side
out
eleanor
had
boasted
too
soon
we
got
headaches
and
backaches
with
stooping
and
puzzling
we
cut
up
all
our
stuff
but
the
gores
remained
obstinate
by
no
ingenuity
could
we
combine
them
so
as
to
be
at
once
in
proper
order
the
right
side
out
and
the
right
side
of
the
pattern
up
i
really
think
we
cried
over
them
with
weariness
and
disappointment
algebra
a
trifle
to
it
was
poor
eleanor
conclusion
i
went
out
to
clear
my
brain
by
a
walk
and
happening
as
i
returned
to
meet
jack
i
confided
our
woes
to
him
one
could
tell
jack
anything
you
got
it
wrong
somehow
said
jack
linking
me
come
to
miss
lining
miss
lining
was
our
village
dressmaker
a
very
bad
one
certainly
but
still
she
could
gore
a
skirt
she
was
not
a
native
of
the
village
and
signified
her
superior
gentility
by
a
mincing
pronunciation
she
had
also
a
hiss
with
the
sibilants
peculiar
to
herself
before
i
could
remonstrate
jack
was
knocking
at
the
door
miss
lining
miss
margery
has
been
making
a
dress
and
she
got
into
a
muddle
with
the
gores
now
how
do
you
manage
with
gores
miss
lining
jack
confidentially
inquired
taking
his
hat
off
and
accepting
a
chair
there
was
now
nothing
for
it
but
to
explain
my
difficulties
which
i
did
miss
lining
saying
yisss
misss
at
every
two
or
three
words
when
i
had
said
my
say
she
sucked
the
top
of
her
brass
thimble
thoughtfully
for
some
moments
and
then
spoke
as
an
oracle
there
a
hinside
and
a
hout
to
the
stuff
yisss
misss
and
a
hup
and
a
down
yisss
misss
and
quite
half
the
gores
wo
fit
in
anywhere
i
desperately
interposed
miss
lining
took
another
taste
of
the
brass
thimble
and
then
said
in
course
misss
with
a
patterned
thing
there
as
many
gores
to
throw
hout
as
to
huse
yisss
misss
there
said
i
but
what
a
waste
ho
no
misss
you
cuts
the
body
out
of
the
gores
you
throws
hout
misss
well
if
you
get
the
body
out
of
them
there
must
be
a
waist
jack
broke
in
as
he
sat
fondling
miss
lining
ho
no
sir
said
miss
lining
who
could
have
seen
a
joke
to
save
her
dignity
they
cuts
to
good
sir
the
mystery
was
now
clear
to
me
and
jack
saw
this
by
my
face
you
understand
said
he
briefly
setting
down
the
cat
quite
said
i
our
mistake
was
beginning
with
the
bodies
but
we
can
get
some
more
stuff
an
odd
bit
always
comes
in
said
miss
lining
speaking
i
fear
from
an
experience
of
bits
saved
from
the
dresses
of
village
patrons
yisss
misss
well
miss
lining
said
jack
who
never
suffered
as
eleanor
and
i
sometimes
did
from
a
difficulty
in
getting
away
from
a
cottage
thank
you
very
much
have
you
heard
from
your
sister
at
buxton
lately
last
week
sir
said
miss
lining
and
how
is
she
said
jack
urbanely
he
never
forgot
any
one
and
he
never
grudged
sympathy
two
qualities
which
made
him
beloved
of
the
village
quite
well
thank
you
sir
and
the
same
to
you
said
miss
lining
beaming
except
that
she
do
suffer
a
deal
in
her
inside
sir
chamomile
tea
is
very
good
for
the
inside
i
believe
said
jack
putting
on
his
hat
with
perfect
gravity
so
i
yisss
sir
said
miss
lining
and
there
something
of
the
same
in
them
pills
that
spoke
so
well
of
in
your
magazine
sir
i
think
i
sent
by
the
carrier
for
a
box
sir
on
saturday
last
and
would
have
done
sooner
but
for
waiting
for
barker
to
pay
for
the
pelerine
i
made
out
of
her
uncle
funeral
scarf
yisss
misss
jack
was
very
seldom
at
a
loss
but
on
this
occasion
he
seemed
puzzled
pills
recommended
in
our
magazine
he
said
as
we
strolled
up
towards
the
vicarage
it
those
medical
tracts
you
and
eleanor
have
been
taking
round
lately
there
nothing
about
pills
in
them
said
i
they
about
drains
and
fresh
air
and
cleanliness
besides
she
said
our
magazine
we
do
give
them
any
magazine
but
the
and
the
missionary
one
said
jack
i
stumped
margery
but
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
startled
by
his
seizing
me
by
the
shoulders
and
leaning
against
me
in
a
paroxysm
of
laughter
oh
margery
i
got
it
it
the
there
been
an
advertisement
at
the
end
of
it
for
months
like
a
of
norton
chamomile
pills
and
as
i
unravelled
to
eleanor
the
mystery
of
our
dressmaking
difficulties
we
could
hear
jack
convulsing
arkwright
with
a
perfect
reproduction
of
miss
lining
accent
them
pills
that
spoke
so
well
of
in
your
magazine
yisss
m
we
got
some
more
material
and
finished
the
dresses
triumphantly
by
the
next
summer
we
were
skilful
enough
to
use
our
taste
with
some
freedom
and
good
success
i
was
then
fifteen
and
in
long
dresses
i
remember
some
most
tasteful
costumes
which
we
produced
and
as
we
contemplated
them
as
they
hung
flounced
furbelowed
and
finished
upon
pegs
eleanor
said
i
wonder
where
we
shall
display
these
this
year
how
little
we
knew
we
had
made
the
dresses
alike
to
the
nicety
of
a
bow
because
we
thought
it
ladylike
that
the
costumes
of
sisters
should
be
so
how
far
we
were
from
guessing
that
they
would
not
be
worn
together
after
all
chapter
xxviii
i
go
back
to
the
vine
after
sunset
a
twilight
existence
salad
of
a
royal
summons
the
few
marked
events
of
my
life
have
generally
happened
on
my
birthdays
it
was
on
my
fifteenth
birthday
that
arkwright
got
a
letter
from
one
of
my
relations
on
the
subject
of
my
going
to
live
with
my
and
grandmother
they
were
now
very
old
my
was
becoming
childish
and
the
little
dear
duchess
was
old
and
frail
for
such
a
charge
alone
they
had
no
daughter
the
religious
question
was
laid
aside
my
most
protestant
relatives
thought
my
duty
in
the
matter
overwhelming
and
with
all
my
clinging
of
heart
to
the
moor
home
i
felt
myself
that
it
was
so
i
do
know
how
i
got
over
the
parting
i
wandered
hopelessly
about
familiar
spots
and
wished
i
had
made
sketches
of
them
but
how
could
i
know
i
had
not
all
life
before
me
the
time
was
short
and
preparations
had
to
be
made
this
kept
us
quiet
at
the
last
jack
put
in
all
my
luggage
and
did
everything
for
me
then
he
kissed
me
and
said
god
bless
you
margery
and
linking
eleanor
by
force
led
her
away
and
comforted
her
like
the
good
dear
boy
he
is
clement
drove
me
so
recklessly
down
the
steep
hill
and
over
the
stones
that
the
momentary
expectation
of
an
upset
dried
my
tears
and
i
did
not
see
much
of
the
villagers
kind
and
too
touching
farewells
and
so
to
the
bleak
station
again
and
the
familiar
old
porter
whom
fate
seems
to
leave
long
enough
at
post
and
on
through
the
whirling
railway
panorama
by
which
one
passes
to
so
much
joy
and
so
much
sorrow
and
then
i
was
at
the
vine
once
more
i
wonder
if
i
am
like
my
in
her
youth
some
people
elspeth
among
them
declare
that
it
is
so
and
others
that
i
am
like
my
poor
mother
i
suppose
i
have
some
vandaleur
features
from
an
eerie
little
incident
which
befell
me
on
the
threshold
of
the
vine
an
appropriate
beginning
to
a
life
that
always
felt
like
a
weird
shadowy
dream
i
did
not
ring
the
bell
of
the
outer
gate
on
my
arrival
because
adolphe
grown
up
but
with
the
old
ruddy
boy
face
on
the
top
of
his
shoulders
was
anxiously
waiting
for
me
and
devoted
himself
to
my
luggage
telling
me
that
master
was
in
the
garden
thither
i
ran
so
hastily
that
a
straggling
sweetbriar
caught
my
hat
and
my
net
and
dragged
them
off
sending
my
hair
over
my
shoulders
my
hair
is
not
long
however
like
eleanor
and
it
curls
and
i
sometimes
wear
it
loose
so
i
did
not
stop
to
rearrange
it
but
hurried
on
towards
my
who
was
coming
slowly
to
meet
me
from
the
other
end
of
the
terrace
his
hands
behind
his
back
as
of
old
at
least
i
thought
it
was
to
meet
me
but
as
he
came
near
i
saw
that
he
was
unconscious
of
my
presence
he
looked
very
old
his
face
was
pale
and
shrivelled
like
a
crumpled
white
kid
glove
his
wild
blue
eyes
insensible
of
what
was
before
them
seemed
intently
fixed
on
something
that
no
one
else
could
see
and
he
was
talking
to
himself
as
we
call
it
when
folk
talk
with
the
invisible
it
was
very
silly
but
i
really
felt
the
colour
fading
from
my
face
with
fright
my
back
was
to
the
west
where
a
few
bars
of
red
across
the
sky
as
it
was
to
be
seen
through
the
scotch
firs
were
all
that
remained
of
the
sunset
that
strange
light
was
on
everything
of
which
modern
painters
are
so
fond
i
was
tired
with
my
long
journey
and
previous
excitement
and
when
i
suddenly
remembered
that
vandaleur
was
said
to
have
in
some
measure
lost
his
reason
a
shudder
came
over
me
in
a
moment
more
he
saw
me
i
think
my
crimson
cloak
caught
his
eye
but
his
welcome
was
hardly
less
alarming
than
his
abstraction
he
started
and
held
up
his
hands
and
a
pained
puzzled
expression
troubled
his
face
then
a
flush
which
seemed
to
make
him
look
older
than
the
whiteness
and
then
with
a
shrill
feeble
cry
of
victoire
ma
belle
he
tottered
towards
me
so
hastily
that
i
thought
he
must
have
fallen
but
like
a
vision
a
little
figure
flitted
from
the
french
window
of
the
and
in
a
moment
my
was
supporting
him
and
soothing
him
with
gentle
words
in
french
i
could
see
now
how
helpless
he
was
for
a
bit
he
seemed
still
puzzled
and
confused
but
he
clung
to
her
and
kissed
her
hand
and
suffered
himself
to
be
led
indoors
then
i
followed
them
through
the
window
into
the
room
where
the
candles
were
not
yet
lighted
for
economy
sake
the
glare
of
the
red
sunset
bars
making
everything
dark
to
me
with
a
strange
sense
of
gloom
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
stronger
contrast
than
that
between
my
life
in
my
new
home
and
my
life
in
my
home
upon
the
moors
at
the
arkwrights
we
lived
so
essentially
with
the
times
our
politics
on
the
whole
were
liberal
our
theology
inclined
to
be
broad
our
ideas
on
social
subjects
were
reformatory
progressive
experimental
scientific
subjects
were
a
speciality
of
the
household
and
living
in
a
manufacturing
district
mere
neighbourhood
kept
us
with
the
great
current
of
mercantile
interests
we
argued
each
other
into
a
general
unfixity
of
opinions
and
full
of
youthful
dreams
of
golden
ages
were
willing
to
believe
this
young
world
where
not
yet
we
but
only
our
words
could
fly
to
be
but
upon
the
threshold
of
true
civilization
above
all
life
seemed
so
short
our
hands
were
so
full
so
of
work
the
daylight
was
not
long
enough
for
us
and
we
grudged
meals
and
sleep
how
different
it
was
under
the
shadow
of
this
old
vine
i
am
very
thankful
now
that
i
had
grace
under
the
sense
of
wasted
time
which
was
at
first
so
irritating
to
hold
by
my
supreme
towards
my
aged
parents
against
the
mere
modern
fuss
of
work
against
what
john
wesley
called
the
lust
of
finishing
any
labour
and
to
serve
them
in
their
way
rather
than
in
my
own
but
the
change
was
very
great
how
we
pottered
through
the
days
with
what
needless
formalities
what
slowness
what
indecision
how
fatiguing
is
enforced
idleness
how
lengthy
were
the
evening
meals
where
we
sat
trifling
with
the
under
a
single
dish
of
fruit
till
the
gloaming
deepened
into
gloom
at
fifteen
one
is
very
susceptible
of
impressions
very
impatient
of
what
one
is
not
used
to
the
very
bed
in
which
i
slept
oppressed
me
and
the
cracked
basin
held
together
for
years
by
the
circular
hole
in
the
washstand
the
only
made
me
laugh
now
then
as
to
the
meals
no
doubt
a
great
many
people
eat
and
drink
too
much
as
we
are
beginning
to
discover
whether
we
at
the
vicarage
did
i
can
not
say
but
the
change
to
the
unsubstantial
fare
on
which
very
old
people
like
the
vandaleurs
keep
the
flickering
light
of
life
aglow
was
very
great
and
yet
in
this
slow
vegetating
existence
my
appetite
soon
died
away
the
country
was
flat
and
damp
too
and
by
and
by
neuralgia
kept
me
awake
at
night
as
regularly
as
the
ghost
of
my
had
done
in
years
gone
by
but
it
is
strange
how
quickly
unmarked
time
slips
on
day
after
day
week
after
week
ran
by
till
a
lassitude
crept
over
me
in
which
i
felt
amazed
at
former
ambitions
and
a
certain
facility
of
sympathy
which
has
been
in
many
respects
an
evil
and
in
many
a
good
to
me
seemed
to
mould
me
to
the
interests
of
the
fading
household
and
so
i
lived
the
life
of
my
which
was
as
if
science
made
no
strides
and
men
no
struggles
as
if
nothing
were
to
be
done
with
the
days
but
to
wear
through
them
in
all
patient
goodness
loyal
to
a
dynasty
regretful
of
some
ancient
virtues
and
courtesies
tender
towards
past
beauties
and
passions
and
patient
of
succeeding
sunsets
till
this
aged
world
should
crumble
to
its
close
my
came
to
know
me
again
though
his
mind
was
in
a
disordered
dreary
condition
from
old
age
elspeth
said
but
it
often
recalled
what
i
had
heard
of
the
state
of
his
mother
intellect
before
her
death
the
dear
little
old
lady
intellects
were
quite
bright
and
happily
not
only
entire
but
cultivated
i
do
not
know
how
people
who
think
babies
and
servants
are
a
woman
only
legitimate
interests
would
like
to
live
with
women
who
have
either
never
met
with
or
long
outlived
them
i
know
how
my
dear
granny
educated
mind
and
sense
of
humour
helped
us
over
a
dozen
little
domestic
difficulties
and
broke
the
neck
of
fidgets
that
seemed
almost
inevitable
at
her
great
age
and
in
that
confined
sphere
of
interests
i
certainly
faded
in
our
twilight
existence
as
if
there
were
some
truth
in
the
strange
old
theory
that
very
aged
people
can
withdraw
vital
force
from
young
companions
and
live
upon
it
but
every
day
and
hour
of
my
stay
made
me
love
and
reverence
my
more
and
more
and
be
more
and
more
glad
that
i
had
come
to
know
her
and
perhaps
be
of
some
little
service
to
her
indeed
it
was
my
condition
that
kept
us
so
much
among
the
shadows
the
old
lady
had
a
delightful
youthfulness
of
spirit
and
took
an
almost
wistful
pleasure
in
hearing
about
our
life
at
the
arkwrights
as
if
some
ambitious
scotch
blood
in
her
would
fain
have
kept
better
pace
with
the
currents
of
the
busy
world
but
when
my
grandfather
joined
us
we
had
to
change
the
subject
modern
ideas
jarred
upon
him
and
it
was
seldom
that
he
was
not
with
us
the
tender
love
between
the
old
couple
was
very
touching
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
my
dear
to
think
of
such
long
lives
so
little
broken
by
events
said
my
but
your
dear
grandfather
and
i
have
never
been
apart
for
a
day
since
our
happy
marriage
i
do
not
think
they
were
apart
for
an
hour
whilst
i
was
with
them
he
followed
her
about
the
house
if
she
left
him
for
many
minutes
crying
victoire
victoire
chiefly
from
love
but
i
was
sometimes
spiteful
enough
to
think
also
because
he
could
not
amuse
himself
the
master
calling
for
you
again
said
elspeth
with
some
impatience
one
day
when
grandmamma
was
teaching
me
a
bit
of
dainty
cookery
in
the
kitchen
oh
fly
petite
she
cried
to
me
and
say
that
his
majesty
has
summoned
the
duchess
much
bewildered
i
ran
out
and
met
my
on
the
terrace
crying
victoire
victoire
in
fretful
tones
his
majesty
has
summoned
the
duchess
sir
said
i
dropping
a
slight
curtsy
as
i
generally
did
on
disturbing
the
old
gentleman
to
my
astonishment
this
seemed
quite
to
content
him
he
drew
in
his
elbows
and
spread
the
palms
of
his
hands
with
a
very
polite
bow
saying
bien
bien
and
after
murmuring
something
else
in
french
which
i
did
not
catch
but
which
i
fancy
was
an
acknowledgment
of
the
prior
claims
of
royalty
he
folded
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
wandered
away
down
the
terrace
as
i
rushed
off
to
my
confectionery
again
i
found
that
this
use
of
the
old
fable
which
had
calmed
my
in
past
days
was
no
new
idea
it
was
in
fact
a
graceful
fiction
which
deceived
nobody
and
had
been
devised
by
my
out
of
deference
to
her
husband
prejudices
in
the
long
years
when
they
were
very
poor
their
poverty
was
made
not
only
tolerable
but
graceful
by
vandaleur
untiring
energy
but
though
he
would
or
perhaps
could
find
any
occupation
by
which
to
add
to
their
income
the
sight
of
his
victoire
who
should
have
been
a
duchess
doing
any
menial
work
so
distracted
him
that
my
grandmother
had
to
devise
some
method
to
secure
herself
from
his
observation
when
she
washed
certain
bits
of
priceless
lace
which
redeemed
her
old
dresses
from
commonness
or
cooked
some
delicacy
for
mons
le
duc
dinner
or
mended
his
honourable
clothes
thus
jeanette
old
fable
came
into
use
first
in
jest
and
then
as
an
adopted
form
for
getting
rid
of
my
when
he
was
in
the
way
it
must
have
astonished
a
practical
woman
like
my
to
find
how
completely
it
satisfied
him
but
there
must
have
been
a
time
when
his
helplessness
and
impracticability
tried
her
in
many
ways
before
she
fairly
came
to
realize
that
he
never
could
be
changed
and
her
love
fell
in
with
his
humours
on
this
point
he
was
humoured
completely
and
never
inquired
on
what
business
his
deceased
majesty
of
france
required
the
attendance
of
the
duchess
that
should
have
been
to
do
him
justice
if
he
was
a
helpless
he
was
a
very
tender
husband
he
has
never
said
a
rude
or
unkind
word
to
me
since
we
were
boy
and
girl
together
said
the
little
old
lady
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
indeed
courtesy
implies
and
even
now
the
old
politeness
checked
his
petulance
over
and
over
again
he
never
gave
up
the
habit
of
gathering
flowers
for
my
grandmother
and
such
exquisite
contrasts
of
colour
i
never
saw
combined
by
any
other
hand
another
accomplishment
of
his
was
also
connected
with
his
love
of
plants
it
little
enough
a
man
can
do
about
a
house
the
best
of
times
said
elspeth
and
the
master
just
as
feckless
as
a
bairn
but
he
makes
a
fine
sallet
i
shudder
almost
as
i
write
the
words
how
little
we
thought
that
my
poor
grandfather
one
useful
gift
would
have
so
fatal
an
ending
but
i
must
put
it
down
in
order
it
was
the
end
of
many
things
of
my
life
at
the
vine
among
them
and
very
nearly
of
my
life
in
this
world
altogether
my
made
delicious
salads
i
have
heard
him
say
that
he
preferred
our
english
habit
of
mixing
ingredients
to
the
french
one
of
dressing
one
vegetable
by
itself
but
he
said
we
did
not
carry
it
far
enough
we
neglected
so
many
useful
herbs
and
so
his
salads
were
compounded
not
only
of
lettuce
and
cress
and
so
forth
but
of
dandelion
sorrel
and
other
field
or
garden
plants
sometimes
one
flavour
preponderated
sometimes
another
and
the
sauce
was
always
good
now
it
is
all
over
it
seems
to
me
that
i
must
have
been
very
stupid
not
to
have
paid
more
attention
to
the
strange
flavour
in
the
salad
that
day
but
i
was
thinking
chiefly
of
the
old
lady
who
was
not
very
well
elspeth
had
an
idea
that
she
had
had
a
very
slight
stroke
but
how
this
was
we
can
not
know
now
whilst
my
grandfather
was
almost
flightily
cheerful
i
tasted
the
salad
and
did
not
eat
it
but
i
was
the
less
inclined
to
complain
of
it
as
they
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
then
my
grandmother
was
taken
at
first
we
thought
it
a
development
of
what
we
had
noticed
then
vandaleur
became
ill
also
and
we
sent
adolphe
in
haste
for
the
doctor
at
last
we
found
out
the
truth
the
salad
was
full
of
young
leaves
of
under
what
delusion
my
poor
grandfather
had
gathered
them
we
never
knew
elspeth
and
i
were
busy
with
the
old
lady
and
he
had
made
the
salad
without
help
from
any
one
from
the
first
the
doctor
gave
us
little
hope
and
they
sank
rapidly
their
priest
for
whom
adolphe
made
a
second
expedition
did
not
arrive
in
time
they
were
in
separate
rooms
and
elspeth
and
i
flitted
from
one
to
the
other
in
sad
attendance
the
dear
little
old
lady
sank
fast
and
died
in
the
evening
then
the
doctor
impressed
on
us
the
necessity
of
keeping
her
death
from
my
knowledge
but
supposing
he
asks
said
i
say
any
soothing
thing
your
ready
wit
may
suggest
my
dear
young
lady
but
the
truth
in
his
present
condition
would
be
a
fatal
shock
it
haunted
me
supposing
he
asks
and
late
in
the
evening
he
did
ask
i
was
alone
with
him
and
he
called
me
marguerite
dear
child
thou
wilt
tell
me
the
truth
why
does
my
wife
my
victoire
thy
grandmother
not
come
to
me
pondering
what
lie
i
could
tell
him
and
how
an
irresistible
impulse
seized
me
i
bent
over
him
and
said
dear
sir
the
king
has
summoned
the
duchess
does
the
mind
regain
power
as
the
body
fails
my
turned
his
head
and
as
his
blue
eyes
met
mine
i
could
not
persuade
myself
that
he
was
deceived
the
will
of
his
majesty
be
done
he
said
faintly
but
firmly
the
next
few
moments
seemed
like
years
had
i
done
wrong
had
it
done
him
harm
above
all
what
did
he
mean
were
his
words
part
of
one
last
graceful
dream
of
the
dynasty
of
the
white
lilies
or
was
his
loyal
submission
made
now
to
a
majesty
not
of
france
not
even
of
this
world
it
was
an
intense
relief
to
me
when
he
spoke
again
marguerite
i
knelt
by
the
bedside
and
he
laid
his
hand
upon
my
head
an
exquisite
smile
shone
on
his
face
good
child
pauvre
petite
his
majesty
will
call
me
also
before
long
is
it
not
so
and
then
thou
shalt
rest
his
fine
face
clouded
again
with
a
wandering
troubled
look
and
his
fingers
fumbled
the
i
saw
that
he
had
lost
his
crucifix
in
moving
his
hand
to
my
head
i
gave
it
him
and
he
clasped
his
hands
over
it
once
more
and
carrying
it
to
his
lips
with
a
smile
closed
his
eyes
like
some
good
child
going
to
sleep
and
thou
o
king
of
kings
didst
summon
him
as
the
dark
faded
into
dawn
chapter
xxix
home
again
home
news
the
very
end
now
it
is
past
it
seems
like
a
dream
my
life
at
the
vine
with
its
sad
end
if
indeed
that
can
be
justly
called
a
sad
end
which
took
away
together
and
with
little
pain
those
dear
souls
whose
married
life
had
not
known
the
parting
of
a
day
and
who
in
death
were
not
even
by
a
day
divided
and
so
i
went
back
to
the
moors
i
was
weak
and
ill
when
i
started
but
every
breath
of
air
on
my
northward
journey
seemed
to
bring
me
strength
there
are
no
events
in
that
porter
life
i
am
convinced
he
looked
just
the
same
and
took
me
and
my
boxes
quite
coolly
though
i
felt
inclined
to
shake
hands
with
him
in
my
delight
i
did
cry
for
very
joy
as
we
toiled
up
the
old
sandy
hill
and
the
great
moors
welcomed
me
back
then
came
the
church
then
the
vicarage
with
the
out
of
my
window
and
the
villagers
were
at
their
doors
and
i
was
at
home
oh
how
the
dear
boys
tore
me
to
pieces
there
was
no
very
special
news
it
seemed
clement
had
been
very
good
in
taking
my
class
at
school
and
had
established
a
cricket
club
jack
had
positively
found
a
new
fungus
which
would
probably
be
named
after
him
boy
luck
as
we
all
said
captain
abercrombie
had
been
staying
with
an
old
uncle
at
a
place
close
by
only
about
twelve
miles
off
and
he
was
constantly
driving
over
so
very
to
the
boys
arkwright
said
and
there
was
to
be
a
tea
on
my
birthday
my
birthday
has
come
and
gone
and
i
am
sixteen
now
dear
old
eleanor
and
i
have
gone
back
to
our
old
ways
she
had
left
my
side
of
our
room
untouched
it
was
in
talking
of
our
recent
parting
and
all
that
has
come
and
gone
in
our
lives
that
the
fancy
came
upon
us
of
writing
our
biographies
this
winter
and
here
in
the
dear
old
kitchen
round
which
the
wild
wind
howls
like
music
with
the
dear
boys
dreaming
at
our
feet
we
bring
them
to
an
end
this
dusty
relic
of
an
old
fad
had
been
lying
by
for
more
than
a
year
when
i
found
it
in
emptying
a
box
to
send
some
books
in
to
oxford
to
jack
eleanor
should
have
had
it
for
we
are
parted
after
all
but
her
husband
has
more
interest
in
hers
so
we
each
keep
our
own
she
is
married
to
george
abercrombie
and
i
mean
to
paste
the
bit
out
of
the
newspaper
account
of
their
wedding
on
to
the
end
of
this
as
a
sort
of
last
chapter
it
would
be
as
long
as
all
the
rest
put
together
if
i
were
to
write
down
all
the
ups
and
downs
and
ins
and
outs
that
went
before
the
marriage
and
i
suppose
these
things
are
always
very
much
alike
i
like
him
very
much
and
i
am
going
to
stay
with
them
the
wedding
was
very
pretty
jack
threw
shoes
to
such
an
extent
that
when
i
went
to
change
my
white
ones
i
could
find
a
complete
pair
to
put
on
he
says
he
meant
to
pick
them
up
again
but
prince
our
new
puppy
thought
they
were
thrown
for
him
and
he
never
brought
them
back
dear
boy
the
old
uncle
helps
george
who
i
believe
is
his
heir
but
at
present
he
sticks
to
the
regiment
it
seems
so
funny
that
eleanor
should
now
be
living
there
and
i
here
in
her
letter
she
says
fancy
margery
my
having
quarrelled
with
minchin
and
not
known
it
she
called
on
me
and
solemnly
forgave
me
whereby
i
learned
that
she
had
been
me
for
six
weeks
when
she
said
doubt
you
thought
it
very
strange
abercrombie
that
i
never
called
on
your
mother
whilst
she
was
with
you
i
was
obliged
to
get
over
it
the
best
way
i
could
for
i
dare
not
tell
her
i
had
never
noticed
it
i
think
my
offence
was
something
about
calls
and
i
must
be
more
particular
but
george
and
i
have
been
sketching
at
every
spare
moment
this
lovely
weather
oh
margery
dear
i
do
often
feel
so
thankful
to
my
mother
for
having
given
us
plenty
of
rational
interests
i
could
really
imagine
even
quarrelling
or
getting
tired
of
each
other
if
we
had
nothing
but
ourselves
in
common
as
it
is
you
ca
tell
till
you
have
a
husband
of
your
own
what
a
double
delight
there
is
in
everything
we
do
together
as
to
social
ups
and
downs
and
not
having
much
money
or
many
fine
dresses
a
alone
makes
one
almost
too
indifferent
do
you
remember
mother
saying
long
ago
that
intellectual
pleasures
have
this
in
common
with
the
consolations
of
religion
that
they
are
such
as
the

can
neither
give
