send
the
black
throne
to
dust
conquer
the
black
ones
and
bring
the
daughter
from
the
caves
of
darkness
these
were
the
tasks
garin
must
perform
to
fulfill
the
prophecy
of
the
ancient
ones
and
establish
his
own
destiny
in
this
hidden
land
the
blue
six
months
and
three
days
after
the
peace
of
shanghai
was
signed
and
the
great
war
of
declared
at
an
end
by
an
exhausted
world
a
young
man
huddled
on
a
park
bench
in
new
york
staring
miserably
at
the
gravel
beneath
his
badly
worn
shoes
he
had
been
trained
to
fill
the
seat
in
the
control
cabin
of
a
fighting
plane
and
for
nothing
else
the
search
for
a
niche
in
civilian
life
had
cost
him
both
health
and
ambition
a
newcomer
dropped
down
on
the
other
end
of
the
bench
the
flyer
studied
him
bitterly
had
decent
shoes
a
warm
coat
and
that
air
of
satisfaction
with
the
world
which
is
the
result
of
economic
security
although
he
was
well
into
middle
age
the
man
had
a
compact
grace
of
movement
and
an
air
of
alertness
are
you
captain
garin
featherstone
startled
the
flyer
nodded
dumbly
from
a
plump
billfold
the
man
drew
a
clipping
and
waved
it
toward
his
seat
mate
two
years
before
captain
garin
featherstone
of
the
united
democratic
forces
had
led
a
perilous
bombing
raid
into
the
wilds
of
siberia
to
wipe
out
the
vast
expeditionary
army
secretly
gathering
there
it
had
been
a
spectacular
affair
and
had
brought
the
survivors
some
fleeting
fame
you
the
sort
of
chap
i
been
looking
for
the
stranger
folded
the
clipping
again
a
flyer
with
courage
initiative
and
brains
the
man
who
led
that
raid
is
worth
investing
in
what
the
proposition
asked
featherstone
wearily
he
no
longer
believed
in
luck
i
gregory
farson
the
other
returned
as
if
that
should
answer
the
question
the
antarctic
man
just
so
as
you
have
probably
heard
i
was
halted
on
the
eve
of
my
last
expedition
by
the
sudden
spread
of
war
to
this
country
now
i
am
preparing
to
sail
south
again
but
i
do
see
how
you
can
help
me
very
simple
captain
featherstone
i
need
pilots
unfortunately
the
war
has
disposed
of
most
of
them
i
lucky
to
contact
one
such
as
yourself
and
it
was
as
simple
as
that
but
garin
did
really
believe
that
it
was
more
than
a
dream
until
they
touched
the
glacial
shores
of
the
polar
continent
some
months
later
as
they
brought
ashore
the
three
large
planes
he
began
to
wonder
at
the
driving
motive
behind
farson
vague
plans
when
the
supply
ship
sailed
not
to
return
for
a
year
farson
called
them
together
three
of
the
company
were
pilots
all
war
veterans
and
two
were
engineers
who
spent
most
of
their
waking
hours
engrossed
in
the
maps
farson
produced
tomorrow
the
leader
glanced
from
face
to
face
we
start
inland
here
on
a
map
spread
before
him
he
indicated
a
line
marked
in
purple
ten
years
ago
i
was
a
member
of
the
verdane
expedition
once
when
flying
due
south
our
plane
was
caught
by
some
freakish
air
current
and
drawn
off
its
course
when
we
were
totally
off
our
map
we
saw
in
the
distance
a
thick
bluish
haze
it
seemed
to
rise
in
a
straight
line
from
the
ice
plain
to
the
sky
unfortunately
our
fuel
was
low
and
we
dared
not
risk
a
closer
investigation
so
we
fought
our
way
back
to
the
base
verdane
however
had
little
interest
in
our
report
and
we
did
not
investigate
it
three
years
ago
that
kattack
expedition
hunting
oil
deposits
by
the
order
of
the
dictator
reported
seeing
the
same
haze
this
time
we
are
going
to
explore
it
why
garin
asked
curiously
are
you
so
eager
to
penetrate
this
haze
i
gather
that
what
we
to
do
farson
hesitated
before
answering
it
has
often
been
suggested
that
beneath
the
ice
sheeting
of
this
continent
may
be
hidden
mineral
wealth
i
believe
that
the
haze
is
caused
by
some
form
of
volcanic
activity
and
perhaps
a
break
in
the
crust
garin
frowned
at
the
map
he
was
so
sure
about
that
explanation
but
farson
was
paying
the
bills
the
flyer
shrugged
away
his
uneasiness
much
could
be
forgiven
a
man
who
allowed
one
to
eat
regularly
again
four
days
later
they
set
out
helmly
one
of
the
engineers
rawlson
a
pilot
and
farson
occupied
the
first
plane
the
other
engineer
and
pilot
were
in
the
second
and
garin
with
the
extra
supplies
was
alone
in
the
third
he
was
content
to
be
alone
as
they
took
off
across
the
waste
his
ship
because
of
its
load
was
loggy
so
he
did
not
attempt
to
follow
the
other
two
into
the
higher
lane
they
were
in
communication
by
radio
and
garin
as
he
snapped
on
his
earphones
remembered
something
farson
had
said
that
morning
the
haze
affects
radio
on
our
trip
near
it
the
static
was
very
bad
almost
with
a
laugh
like
speech
in
some
foreign
tongue
as
they
roared
over
the
ice
garin
wondered
if
it
might
have
been
speech
from
perhaps
a
secret
enemy
expedition
such
as
the
kattack
one
in
his
sealed
cockpit
he
did
not
feel
the
bite
of
the
frost
and
the
ship
rode
smoothly
with
a
little
sigh
of
content
he
settled
back
against
the
cushions
keeping
to
the
course
set
by
the
planes
ahead
and
above
him
some
five
hours
after
they
left
the
base
garin
caught
sight
of
a
dark
shadow
far
ahead
at
the
same
time
farson
voice
chattered
in
his
earphones
that
it
set
course
straight
ahead
the
shadow
grew
until
it
became
a
wall
of
from
earth
to
sky
the
first
plane
was
quite
close
to
it
diving
down
into
the
vapor
suddenly
the
ship
rocked
violently
and
swung
earthward
as
if
out
of
control
then
it
straightened
and
turned
back
garin
could
hear
farson
demanding
to
know
what
was
the
matter
but
from
the
first
plane
there
was
no
reply
as
farson
plane
kept
going
garin
throttled
down
the
actions
of
the
first
ship
indicated
trouble
what
if
that
haze
were
a
toxic
gas
close
up
featherstone
barked
farson
suddenly
he
obediently
drew
ahead
until
they
flew
wing
to
wing
the
haze
was
just
before
them
and
now
garin
could
see
movement
in
it
oily
impenetrable
billows
the
motors
bit
into
it
there
was
clammy
foggy
moisture
on
the
windows
abruptly
garin
sensed
that
he
was
no
longer
alone
somewhere
in
the
empty
cabin
behind
him
was
another
intelligence
a
measuring
power
he
fought
furiously
against
it
against
the
very
idea
of
it
but
after
a
long
terrifying
moment
while
it
seemed
to
study
him
it
took
control
his
hands
and
feet
still
manipulated
the
ship
but
flew
on
the
ship
hurtled
through
the
thickening
mist
he
lost
sight
of
farson
plane
and
though
he
was
still
fighting
against
the
will
which
his
his
struggles
grew
weaker
then
came
the
order
to
dive
into
the
dark
heart
of
the
purple
mists
down
they
whirled
once
as
the
haze
opened
garin
caught
a
glimpse
of
tortured
gray
rock
seamed
with
yellow
farson
had
been
right
here
the
ice
crust
was
broken
down
and
down
if
his
instruments
were
correct
the
plane
was
below
sea
level
now
the
haze
thinned
and
was
gone
below
spread
a
plain
cloaked
in
vivid
green
here
and
there
reared
clumps
of
what
might
be
trees
he
saw
too
the
waters
of
a
yellow
stream
but
there
was
something
terrifyingly
alien
about
that
landscape
even
as
he
circled
above
it
garin
wrested
to
break
the
grip
of
the
will
that
had
brought
him
there
there
came
a
crackle
of
sound
in
his
earphones
and
at
that
moment
the
presence
withdrew
the
nose
of
the
plane
went
up
in
obedience
to
his
own
desire
frantically
he
climbed
away
from
the
green
land
again
the
haze
absorbed
him
he
watched
the
moisture
bead
on
the
windows
another
hundred
feet
or
so
and
he
would
be
free
of
it
and
that
unbelievable
world
beneath
then
with
an
ominous
sputter
the
port
engine
conked
out
the
plane
lurched
and
slipped
into
a
dive
down
it
whirled
again
into
the
steady
light
of
the
green
land
trees
came
out
of
the
ground
huge
plants
with
crimson
scaled
trunks
toward
a
clump
of
these
the
plane
swooped
frantically
garin
fought
the
controls
the
ship
steadied
the
dive
became
a
fast
glide
he
looked
for
an
open
space
to
land
then
he
felt
the
landing
gear
scrape
some
surface
directly
ahead
loomed
one
of
the
fern
trees
the
plane
sped
toward
the
long
fronds
there
came
a
ripping
crash
the
splintering
of
metal
and
wood
the
scarlet
cloud
gathering
before
garin
eyes
turned
black
folk
of
garin
returned
to
consciousness
through
a
red
mist
of
pain
he
was
pinned
in
the
crumpled
mass
of
metal
which
had
once
been
the
cabin
through
a
rent
in
the
wall
close
to
his
head
thrust
a
long
spike
of
green
shredded
leaves
still
clinging
to
it
he
lay
and
watched
it
not
daring
to
move
lest
the
pain
prove
more
than
he
could
bear
it
was
then
that
he
heard
the
pattering
sound
outside
it
seemed
as
if
soft
hands
were
pushing
and
pulling
at
the
wreck
the
tree
branch
shook
and
a
portion
of
the
cabin
wall
dropped
away
with
a
clang
garin
turned
his
head
slowly
through
the
aperture
was
clambering
a
goblin
figure
it
stood
about
five
feet
tall
and
it
walked
upon
its
hind
legs
in
human
fashion
but
the
legs
were
short
and
stumpy
ending
in
feet
with
five
toes
of
equal
length
slender
shapely
arms
possessed
small
hands
with
only
four
digits
the
creature
had
a
high
forehead
but
no
chin
the
face
being
distinctly
in
contour
the
skin
was
a
dull
black
with
a
velvety
surface
about
its
loins
it
wore
a
short
kilt
of
metallic
cloth
the
garment
being
supported
by
a
jeweled
belt
of
exquisite
workmanship
for
a
long
moment
the
apparition
eyed
garin
and
it
was
those
golden
eyes
fixed
unwinkingly
on
his
which
banished
the
flyer
fear
there
was
nothing
but
great
pity
in
their
depths
the
stooped
and
brushed
the
hair
from
forehead
then
he
fingered
the
bonds
of
metal
which
held
the
flyer
as
if
estimating
their
strength
having
done
so
he
turned
to
the
opening
and
apparently
gave
an
order
returning
again
to
squat
by
garin
two
more
of
his
kind
appeared
to
tear
away
the
ruins
of
the
cockpit
though
they
were
very
careful
garin
fainted
twice
before
they
had
freed
him
he
was
placed
on
a
litter
swung
between
two
clumsy
beasts
which
might
have
been
small
elephants
except
that
they
lacked
trunks
and
possessed
four
tusks
each
they
crossed
the
plain
to
the
towering
mouth
of
a
huge
cavern
where
the
litter
was
taken
up
by
four
of
the
the
flyer
lay
staring
up
at
the
roof
of
the
cavern
in
the
black
stone
had
been
carved
fronds
and
flowers
in
bewildering
profusion
shining
motes
giving
off
faint
light
sifted
through
the
air
at
times
as
they
advanced
these
gathered
in
clusters
and
the
light
grew
brighter
midway
down
a
long
corridor
the
bearers
halted
while
their
leader
pulled
upon
a
knob
on
the
wall
an
oval
door
swung
back
and
the
party
passed
through
they
came
into
a
round
room
the
walls
of
which
had
been
fashioned
of
creamy
quartz
veined
with
violet
at
the
highest
point
in
the
ceiling
a
large
globe
of
the
motes
hung
furnishing
soft
light
below
two
clad
in
long
robes
conferred
with
the
leader
of
the
flyer
party
before
coming
to
stand
over
garin
one
of
the
robed
ones
shook
his
head
at
the
sight
of
the
flyer
twisted
body
and
waved
the
litter
on
into
an
inner
chamber
here
the
walls
were
dull
blue
and
in
the
exact
center
was
a
long
block
of
quartz
by
this
the
litter
was
put
down
and
the
bearers
disappeared
with
sharp
knives
the
robed
men
cut
away
furs
and
leather
to
expose
garin
broken
body
they
lifted
him
to
the
quartz
table
and
there
made
him
fast
with
metal
bonds
then
one
of
them
went
to
the
wall
and
pulled
a
gleaming
rod
from
the
dome
of
the
roof
shot
an
eerie
blue
light
to
beat
upon
helpless
body
there
followed
a
tingling
through
every
muscle
and
joint
a
prickling
sensation
in
his
skin
but
soon
his
pain
vanished
as
if
it
had
never
been
the
light
flashed
off
and
the
three
gathered
around
him
he
was
wrapped
in
a
soft
robe
and
carried
to
another
room
this
too
was
circular
shaped
like
the
half
of
a
giant
bubble
the
floor
sloped
toward
the
center
where
there
was
a
depression
filled
with
cushions
there
they
laid
garin
at
the
top
of
the
bubble
a
pinkish
cloud
formed
he
watched
it
drowsily
until
he
fell
asleep
something
warm
stirred
against
his
bare
shoulder
he
opened
his
eyes
for
a
moment
unable
to
remember
where
he
was
then
there
was
a
plucking
at
the
robe
twisted
about
him
and
he
looked
down
illustration
if
the
had
been
goblin
in
their
grotesqueness
this
visitor
was
elfin
it
was
about
three
feet
high
its
body
completely
covered
with
silky
white
hair
the
tiny
hands
were
human
in
shape
and
hairless
but
its
feet
were
much
like
a
cat
paws
from
either
side
of
the
small
round
head
branched
large
ears
the
face
was
furred
and
boasted
stiff
cat
whiskers
on
the
upper
lip
these
as
garin
learned
later
were
happy
little
creatures
each
one
choosing
some
mistress
or
master
among
the
folk
as
this
one
had
come
to
him
they
were
content
to
follow
their
big
protector
speechless
with
delight
at
trifling
gifts
loyal
and
brave
they
could
do
simple
tasks
or
carry
written
messages
for
their
chosen
friend
and
they
remained
with
him
until
death
they
were
neither
beast
nor
human
but
rumored
to
be
the
result
of
some
experiment
carried
out
eons
ago
by
the
ancient
ones
after
patting
garin
shoulder
the
ana
touched
the
flyer
hair
wonderingly
comparing
the
bronze
lengths
with
its
own
white
fur
since
the
folk
were
hairless
hair
was
a
strange
sight
in
the
caverns
with
a
contented
purr
it
rubbed
its
head
against
his
hand
with
a
sudden
click
a
door
in
the
wall
opened
the
ana
got
to
its
feet
and
ran
to
greet
the
newcomers
the
chieftain
of
the
folk
he
who
had
first
discovered
garin
entered
followed
by
several
of
his
fellows
the
flyer
sat
up
not
only
was
the
pain
gone
but
he
felt
stronger
and
younger
than
he
had
for
weary
months
exultingly
he
stretched
wide
his
arms
and
grinned
at
the
who
murmured
happily
in
return
busied
themselves
about
garin
girding
on
him
the
short
kilt
and
belt
which
were
the
only
clothing
of
the
caverns
when
they
were
finished
the
chieftain
took
his
hand
and
drew
him
to
the
door
they
traversed
a
hallway
whose
walls
were
carved
and
inlaid
with
glittering
stones
and
metalwork
coming
at
last
into
a
huge
cavern
the
outer
walls
of
which
were
hidden
by
shadows
on
a
dais
stood
three
tall
thrones
and
garin
was
conducted
to
the
foot
of
these
the
highest
throne
was
of
rose
crystal
on
its
right
was
one
of
green
jade
worn
smooth
by
centuries
of
time
at
the
left
was
the
third
carved
of
a
single
block
of
jet
the
rose
throne
and
that
of
jet
were
unoccupied
but
in
the
seat
of
jade
reposed
one
of
the
folk
he
was
taller
than
his
fellows
and
in
his
eyes
as
he
stared
at
garin
was
wisdom
and
a
brooding
sadness
it
is
well
the
words
resounded
in
the
flyer
head
we
have
chosen
wisely
this
youth
is
fit
to
mate
with
the
daughter
but
he
will
be
tried
as
fire
tries
metal
he
must
win
the
daughter
forth
and
strive
with
kepta
a
hissing
murmur
echoed
through
the
hall
garin
guessed
that
hundreds
of
the
folk
must
be
gathered
there
urg
the
being
on
the
throne
commanded
the
chieftain
moved
a
step
toward
the
dais
do
you
take
this
youth
and
instruct
him
and
then
will
i
speak
with
him
again
for
sadness
colored
the
words
now
we
would
have
the
rose
throne
filled
again
and
the
black
one
blasted
into
dust
time
moves
swiftly
the
chieftain
led
a
wondering
garin
away
hears
of
the
black
urg
brought
the
flyer
into
one
of
the
rooms
which
contained
a
low
cushioned
bench
facing
a
metal
screen
and
here
they
seated
themselves
what
followed
was
a
language
lesson
on
the
screen
appeared
objects
which
urg
would
name
to
have
his
sibilant
uttering
repeated
by
garin
as
the
american
later
learned
the
ray
treatment
he
had
undergone
had
quickened
his
mental
powers
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
he
had
a
working
vocabulary
judging
by
the
pictures
the
lizard
folk
were
the
rulers
of
the
crater
world
although
there
were
other
forms
of
life
there
the
was
a
beast
of
burden
the
lived
underground
and
carried
on
a
crude
agriculture
in
small
clearings
coming
shyly
twice
a
year
to
exchange
grain
for
a
liquid
rubber
produced
by
the
folk
then
there
was
the
a
monstrous
bee
also
friendly
to
the
lizard
people
it
supplied
the
cavern
dwellers
with
wax
and
in
return
the
folk
gave
the
gibi
colonies
shelter
during
the
unhealthful
times
of
the
great
mists
highly
civilized
were
the
folk
they
did
no
work
by
hand
except
the
finer
kinds
of
jewel
setting
and
carving
machines
wove
their
metal
cloth
machines
prepared
their
food
harvested
their
fields
hollowed
out
new
dwellings
freed
from
manual
labor
they
had
turned
to
acquiring
knowledge
urg
projected
on
the
screen
pictures
of
vast
laboratories
and
great
libraries
of
scientific
lore
but
all
they
knew
in
the
beginning
they
had
learned
from
the
ancient
ones
a
race
unlike
themselves
which
had
preceded
them
in
sovereignty
over
even
the
folk
themselves
were
the
result
of
constant
forced
evolution
and
experimentation
carried
on
by
these
ancient
ones
all
this
wisdom
was
guarded
most
carefully
but
against
what
or
whom
urg
could
not
tell
although
he
insisted
that
the
danger
was
very
real
there
was
something
within
the
blue
wall
of
the
crater
which
disputed
the
folk
rule
as
garin
tried
to
probe
further
a
gong
sounded
urg
arose
it
is
the
hour
of
eating
he
announced
let
us
go
they
came
to
a
large
room
where
a
heavy
table
of
white
stone
stretched
along
three
walls
benches
before
it
urg
seated
himself
and
pressed
a
knob
on
the
table
motioning
garin
to
do
likewise
the
wall
facing
them
opened
and
two
trays
slid
out
there
was
a
platter
of
hot
meat
covered
with
rich
sauce
a
stone
bowl
of
grain
porridge
and
a
cluster
of
fruit
still
fastened
to
a
leafy
branch
this
the
ana
eyed
so
wistfully
that
garin
gave
it
to
the
creature
the
folk
ate
silently
and
arose
quietly
when
they
had
finished
their
trays
vanishing
back
through
the
wall
garin
noticed
only
males
in
the
room
and
recalled
that
he
had
as
yet
seen
no
females
among
the
folk
he
ventured
a
question
urg
chuckled
so
you
think
there
are
no
women
in
the
caverns
well
we
shall
go
to
the
hall
of
women
that
you
may
see
to
the
hall
of
women
they
went
it
was
in
its
richness
stones
worth
a
nation
ransom
sparkling
from
its
domed
roof
and
painted
walls
here
were
the
matrons
and
maidens
of
the
folk
their
black
forms
veiled
in
robes
of
silver
net
each
cross
strand
of
which
was
set
with
a
tiny
gem
so
that
they
appeared
to
be
wrapped
in
glittering
scales
there
were
not
many
of
them
a
hundred
perhaps
and
a
few
led
by
the
hand
smaller
editions
of
themselves
who
stared
at
garin
with
round
yellow
eyes
and
chewed
black
fingertips
shyly
the
women
were
intrusted
with
the
finest
jewel
work
and
with
pride
they
showed
the
stranger
their
handiwork
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
was
a
wonderous
thing
in
the
making
one
of
the
silver
nets
which
were
the
foundations
of
their
robes
was
fastened
there
and
three
of
the
women
were
putting
small
rose
jewels
into
each
microscopic
setting
here
and
there
they
had
varied
the
pattern
with
tiny
emeralds
or
flaming
opals
so
that
the
finished
portion
was
a
rainbow
one
of
the
workers
smoothed
the
robe
and
glanced
up
at
garin
a
gentle
teasing
in
her
voice
as
she
explained
this
is
for
the
daughter
when
she
comes
to
her
throne
the
daughter
what
had
the
lord
of
the
folk
said
this
youth
is
fit
to
mate
with
the
daughter
but
urg
had
said
that
the
ancient
ones
had
gone
from
tav
who
is
the
daughter
he
demanded
thrala
of
the
light
where
is
she
the
woman
shivered
and
there
was
fear
in
her
eyes
thrala
lies
in
the
caves
of
darkness
the
caves
of
darkness
did
she
mean
thrala
was
dead
was
he
garin
featherstone
to
be
the
victim
of
some
rite
of
sacrifice
which
was
designed
to
unite
him
with
the
dead
urg
touched
his
arm
not
so
thrala
has
not
yet
entered
the
place
of
ancestors
you
know
my
thoughts
urg
laughed
thoughts
are
easy
to
read
thrala
lives
sera
served
the
daughter
as
handmaiden
while
she
was
yet
among
us
sera
do
you
show
us
thrala
as
she
was
the
woman
crossed
to
a
wall
where
there
was
a
mirror
such
as
urg
had
used
for
his
language
lesson
she
gazed
into
it
and
then
beckoned
the
flyer
to
stand
beside
her
the
mirror
misted
and
then
he
was
looking
as
if
through
a
window
into
a
room
with
walls
and
ceiling
of
rose
quartz
on
the
floor
were
thick
rugs
of
silver
rose
and
a
great
heap
of
cushions
made
a
low
couch
in
the
center
the
inner
chamber
of
the
daughter
sera
announced
a
circular
panel
in
the
wall
opened
and
a
woman
slipped
through
she
was
very
young
little
more
than
a
girl
there
were
happy
curves
in
her
full
crimson
lips
joyous
lights
in
her
violet
eyes
she
was
human
of
shape
but
her
beauty
was
unearthly
her
skin
was
pearl
white
and
other
colors
seemed
to
play
faintly
upon
it
so
that
it
reminded
garin
of
with
its
lights
and
shadows
the
hair
which
veiled
her
as
a
cloud
was
and
reached
below
her
knees
she
was
robed
in
the
silver
net
of
the
folk
and
there
was
a
heavy
girdle
of
jewels
about
her
slender
waist
that
was
thrala
before
the
black
ones
took
her
said
sera
garin
uttered
a
cry
of
disappointment
as
the
picture
vanished
urg
laughed
what
care
you
for
shadows
when
the
daughter
herself
waits
for
you
you
have
but
to
bring
her
from
the
caves
of
darkness
where
are
these
caves
garin
question
was
interrupted
by
the
pealing
of
the
cavern
gong
sera
cried
out
the
black
ones
urg
shrugged
when
they
spared
not
the
ancient
ones
how
could
we
hope
to
escape
come
we
must
go
to
the
hall
of
thrones
before
the
jade
throne
of
the
lord
of
the
folk
stood
a
small
group
of
the
beside
two
litters
as
garin
entered
the
lord
spoke
let
the
outlander
come
hither
that
he
may
see
the
work
of
the
black
ones
garin
advanced
unwillingly
coming
to
stand
by
those
struggling
things
which
gasped
their
message
between
moans
and
screams
of
agony
they
were
men
of
the
folk
but
their
black
skins
were
green
with
rot
the
lord
leaned
forward
on
his
throne
it
is
well
he
said
you
may
depart
as
if
obeying
his
command
the
tortured
things
let
go
of
the
life
to
which
they
had
clung
and
were
still
look
upon
the
work
of
the
black
ones
the
ruler
said
to
garin
jiv
and
betv
were
captured
while
on
a
mission
to
the
gibi
of
the
cliff
it
seems
that
the
black
ones
needed
material
for
their
laboratories
they
seek
even
to
give
the
daughter
to
their
workers
of
horror
a
terrible
cry
of
hatred
arose
from
the
hall
and
garin
jaw
set
to
give
that
fair
vision
he
had
just
seen
to
such
a
death
as
this
jiv
and
betv
were
imprisoned
close
to
the
daughter
and
they
heard
the
threats
of
kepta
our
brothers
stricken
with
foul
disease
were
sent
forth
to
carry
the
plague
to
us
but
they
swam
through
the
pool
of
boiling
mud
they
have
died
but
the
evil
died
with
them
and
i
think
that
while
we
breed
such
as
they
the
black
ones
shall
not
rest
easy
listen
now
outlander
to
the
story
of
the
black
ones
and
the
caves
of
darkness
of
how
the
ancient
ones
brought
the
folk
up
from
the
slime
of
a
long
dried
sea
and
made
them
great
and
of
how
the
ancient
ones
at
last
went
down
to
their
destruction
defeat
of
the
ancient
in
the
days
before
the
lands
of
the
outer
world
were
born
of
the
sea
before
even
the
land
of
the
sun
mu
and
the
land
of
the
sea
atlantis
arose
from
molten
rock
and
sand
there
was
land
here
in
the
far
south
a
sere
land
of
rock
plains
and
swamps
where
slimy
life
mated
lived
and
died
then
came
the
ancient
ones
from
beyond
the
stars
their
race
was
already
older
than
this
earth
their
wise
men
had
watched
its
from
the
sun
and
when
their
world
perished
taking
most
of
their
blood
into
nothingness
a
handful
fled
hither
but
when
they
climbed
from
their
space
ship
it
was
into
hell
for
they
had
gained
in
place
of
their
loved
home
bare
rock
and
stinking
slime
they
blasted
out
this
tav
and
entered
into
it
with
the
treasures
of
their
flying
ships
and
also
certain
living
creatures
captured
in
the
swamps
from
these
they
produced
the
folk
the
gibi
the
tand
and
the
eron
among
these
the
folk
were
eager
for
wisdom
and
climbed
high
but
still
the
learning
of
the
ancient
ones
remained
beyond
their
grasp
during
the
eons
the
ancient
ones
dwelt
within
their
protecting
wall
of
haze
the
outer
world
changed
cold
came
to
the
north
and
south
the
land
of
sun
and
the
land
of
sea
arose
to
bear
the
foot
of
true
man
on
their
mirrors
of
seeing
the
ancient
ones
watched
spread
across
the
world
they
had
the
power
of
prolonging
life
but
still
the
race
was
dying
from
without
must
come
new
blood
so
certain
men
were
summoned
from
the
land
of
the
sun
then
the
race
flourished
for
a
space
the
ancient
ones
decided
to
leave
tav
for
the
outer
world
but
the
sea
swallowed
the
land
of
sun
again
in
the
time
of
the
land
of
sea
the
stock
within
tav
was
replenished
and
the
ancient
ones
prepared
for
exodus
again
the
sea
cheated
them
those
men
left
in
the
outer
world
reverted
to
savagery
since
the
ancient
ones
would
not
mingle
their
blood
with
that
of
almost
beasts
they
built
the
haze
wall
stronger
and
remained
but
a
handful
of
them
were
attracted
by
the
forbidden
and
secretly
they
summoned
the
beast
men
of
that
monstrous
mating
came
the
black
ones
they
live
but
for
the
evil
they
may
do
and
the
power
which
they
acquired
is
debased
and
used
to
forward
cruelty
at
first
their
sin
was
not
discovered
when
it
was
the
others
would
have
slain
the
offspring
but
for
the
law
which
forbids
them
to
kill
they
must
use
their
power
for
good
or
it
departs
from
them
so
they
drove
the
black
ones
to
the
southern
end
of
tav
and
gave
them
the
caves
of
darkness
never
were
the
black
ones
to
come
north
of
the
river
of
gold
nor
were
the
ancient
ones
to
go
south
of
it
for
perhaps
two
thousand
years
the
black
ones
kept
the
law
but
they
worked
building
powers
of
destruction
while
matters
rested
thus
the
ancient
ones
searched
the
world
seeking
men
by
whom
they
could
renew
the
race
once
there
came
men
from
an
island
far
to
the
north
six
lived
to
penetrate
the
mists
and
take
wives
among
the
daughters
again
they
called
the
men
of
another
breed
great
sea
rovers
but
the
black
ones
called
too
as
the
ancient
ones
searched
for
the
best
the
black
ones
brought
in
great
workers
of
evil
and
at
last
they
succeeded
in
shutting
off
the
channels
of
sending
thought
so
that
the
ancient
ones
could
call
no
more
then
did
the
black
ones
cross
the
river
of
gold
and
enter
the
land
of
the
ancient
ones
thran
dweller
in
the
light
and
lord
of
the
caverns
summoned
the
folk
to
him
will
come
one
to
aid
you
he
told
us
the
summoning
again
after
the
black
ones
have
seemed
to
win
thrala
daughter
of
the
light
will
not
enter
into
the
room
of
pleasant
death
with
the
rest
of
the
women
but
will
give
herself
into
the
hands
of
the
black
ones
that
they
may
think
themselves
truly
victorious
you
of
the
folk
withdraw
into
the
place
of
reptiles
until
the
black
ones
are
gone
nor
will
all
the
ancient
ones
perish
more
will
be
saved
but
the
manner
of
their
preservation
i
dare
not
tell
when
the
youth
comes
from
the
outer
world
send
him
into
the
caves
of
darkness
to
rescue
thrala
and
put
an
end
to
evil
and
then
the
lady
thrala
arose
and
said
softly
the
lord
thran
has
said
so
let
it
be
i
shall
deliver
myself
into
the
hands
of
the
black
ones
that
their
doom
may
come
upon
them
lord
thran
smiled
upon
her
as
he
said
will
happiness
be
your
portion
after
the
great
mists
does
not
light
come
again
the
women
of
the
ancient
ones
then
took
their
leave
and
passed
into
the
place
of
pleasant
death
while
the
men
made
ready
for
battle
with
the
black
ones
for
three
days
they
fought
but
a
new
weapon
of
the
black
ones
won
the
day
and
the
chief
of
the
black
ones
set
up
this
throne
of
jet
as
proof
of
his
power
since
however
the
black
ones
were
not
happy
in
the
caverns
longing
for
the
darkness
of
their
caves
they
soon
withdrew
and
we
the
folk
came
forth
again
but
now
the
time
has
come
when
the
dark
ones
will
sacrifice
the
daughter
to
their
evil
if
you
can
win
her
free
outlander
they
shall
perish
as
if
they
had
not
been
what
of
the
ancient
ones
asked
garin
those
others
thran
said
would
be
saved
of
those
we
know
nothing
save
that
when
we
bore
the
bodies
of
the
fallen
to
the
place
of
ancestors
there
were
some
missing
that
you
may
see
the
truth
of
this
story
urg
will
take
you
to
the
gallery
above
the
room
of
pleasant
death
and
you
may
look
upon
those
who
sleep
there
urg
guiding
garin
climbed
a
steep
ramp
leading
from
the
hall
of
thrones
this
led
to
a
narrow
balcony
one
side
of
which
was
clear
crystal
urg
pointed
down
they
were
above
a
long
room
whose
walls
were
tinted
jade
green
on
the
polished
floor
were
scattered
piles
of
cushions
each
was
occupied
by
a
sleeping
woman
and
several
of
these
clasped
a
child
in
their
arms
their
long
hair
rippled
to
the
floor
their
curved
lashes
made
dark
shadows
on
pale
faces
but
they
are
sleeping
protested
garin
urg
shook
his
head
it
is
the
sleep
of
death
twice
each
ten
hours
vapors
rise
from
the
floor
those
breathing
them
do
not
wake
again
and
if
they
are
undisturbed
they
will
lie
thus
for
a
thousand
years
look
there
he
pointed
to
the
closed
double
doors
of
the
room
there
lay
the
first
men
of
the
ancient
ones
garin
had
seen
they
too
seemed
but
asleep
their
handsome
heads
pillowed
on
their
arms
thran
ordered
those
who
remained
after
the
last
battle
in
the
hall
of
thrones
to
enter
the
room
of
pleasant
death
that
the
black
ones
might
not
torture
them
for
their
beastly
pleasures
thran
himself
remained
behind
to
close
the
door
and
so
died
there
were
no
aged
among
the
sleepers
none
of
the
men
seemed
to
count
more
than
thirty
years
and
many
of
them
appeared
younger
garin
remarked
upon
this
the
ancient
ones
appeared
thus
until
the
day
of
their
death
though
many
lived
twice
a
hundred
years
the
light
rays
kept
them
so
even
we
of
the
folk
can
hold
back
age
but
come
now
our
lord
trar
would
speak
with
you
again
the
caves
of
again
garin
stood
before
the
jade
throne
of
trar
and
heard
the
stirring
of
the
multitude
of
the
folk
in
the
shadows
trar
was
turning
a
small
rod
of
glittering
greenish
metal
around
in
his
soft
hands
listen
well
outlander
he
began
for
little
time
remains
to
us
within
seven
days
the
great
mists
will
be
upon
us
then
no
living
thing
may
venture
forth
from
shelter
and
escape
death
and
before
that
time
thrala
must
be
out
of
the
caves
this
rod
will
be
your
weapon
the
black
ones
have
not
its
secret
watch
two
of
the
folk
dragged
an
ingot
of
metal
before
him
he
touched
it
with
the
rod
great
flakes
of
rust
appeared
to
spread
across
the
entire
surface
it
crumpled
away
and
one
of
the
folk
trod
upon
the
pile
of
dust
where
it
had
been
thrala
lies
in
the
heart
of
the
caves
but
kepta
men
have
grown
careless
with
the
years
enter
boldly
and
trust
to
fortune
they
know
nothing
of
your
coming
or
of
thran
words
concerning
you
urg
stood
forward
and
held
out
his
hands
in
appeal
what
would
you
urg
lord
i
would
go
with
the
outlander
he
knows
nothing
of
the
forest
of
the
morgels
or
of
the
pool
of
mud
it
is
easy
to
go
astray
in
the
woodland
trar
shook
his
head
that
may
not
be
he
must
go
alone
even
as
thran
said
the
ana
which
had
followed
in
garin
shadow
all
day
whistled
shrilly
and
stood
on
tiptoe
to
tug
at
his
hand
trar
smiled
that
one
may
go
its
eyes
may
serve
you
well
urg
will
guide
you
to
the
outer
portal
of
the
place
of
ancestors
and
set
you
upon
the
road
to
the
caves
farewell
outlander
and
may
the
spirits
of
the
ancient
ones
be
with
you
garin
bowed
to
the
ruler
of
the
folk
and
turned
to
follow
urg
near
the
door
stood
a
small
group
of
women
sera
pressed
forward
from
them
holding
out
a
small
bag
outlander
she
said
hurriedly
when
you
look
upon
the
daughter
speak
to
her
of
sera
for
i
have
awaited
her
many
years
he
smiled
that
i
will
if
you
remember
outlander
i
am
a
great
lady
among
the
folk
and
have
my
share
of
suitors
yet
i
think
i
could
envy
the
daughter
nay
i
shall
not
explain
that
she
laughed
mockingly
you
will
understand
in
due
time
here
is
a
packet
of
food
now
go
swiftly
that
we
may
have
you
among
us
again
before
the
mists
so
a
woman
farewell
sped
them
on
their
way
urg
chose
a
ramp
which
led
downward
at
its
foot
was
a
niche
in
the
rock
above
which
a
rose
light
burned
dimly
urg
reached
within
the
hollow
and
drew
out
a
pair
of
high
buskins
which
he
aided
garin
to
lace
on
they
were
a
good
fit
having
been
fashioned
for
a
man
of
the
ancient
ones
the
passage
before
them
was
narrow
and
crooked
there
was
a
thick
carpet
of
dust
underfoot
patterned
by
the
prints
of
the
folk
they
rounded
a
corner
and
a
tall
door
loomed
out
of
the
gloom
urg
pressed
the
surface
there
was
a
click
and
the
stone
rolled
back
illustration
the
ana
perched
on
his
shoulder
and
the
green
rod
of
destruction
in
his
hand
garin
strode
into
the
gloom
of
tav
pledged
to
bring
the
daughter
out
of
the
caves
of
darkness
this
is
the
place
of
ancestors
he
announced
as
he
stepped
within
they
were
at
the
end
of
a
colossal
hall
whose
domed
roof
disappeared
into
shadows
thick
pillars
of
gleaming
crystal
divided
it
into
aisles
all
leading
inward
to
a
raised
dais
of
oval
shape
filling
the
aisles
were
couches
and
each
soft
nest
held
its
sleeper
near
to
the
door
lay
the
men
and
women
of
the
folk
but
closer
to
the
dais
were
the
ancient
ones
here
and
there
a
couch
bore
a
double
burden
upon
the
shoulder
of
a
man
was
pillowed
the
drooping
head
of
a
woman
urg
stopped
beside
such
a
one
see
outlander
here
was
one
who
was
called
from
your
world
marena
of
the
house
of
light
looked
with
favor
upon
him
and
their
days
of
happiness
were
many
the
man
on
the
couch
had
hair
and
on
his
upper
arm
was
a
heavy
band
of
gold
whose
mate
garin
had
once
seen
in
a
museum
a
son
of
ireland
urg
traced
with
a
crooked
finger
the
archaic
lettering
carved
upon
the
stone
base
of
the
couch
lovers
in
the
light
sleep
sweetly
the
light
returns
on
the
appointed
day
who
lies
there
garin
motioned
to
the
dais
the
first
ancient
ones
come
look
upon
those
who
made
this
tav
on
the
dais
the
couches
were
arranged
in
two
rows
and
between
them
in
the
center
was
a
single
couch
raised
above
the
others
fifty
men
and
women
lay
as
if
but
resting
for
the
hour
smiles
on
their
peaceful
faces
but
weary
shadows
beneath
their
eyes
there
was
an
quality
about
them
which
was
lacking
in
their
descendents
urg
advanced
to
the
high
couch
and
beckoned
garin
to
join
him
a
man
and
a
woman
lay
there
the
woman
head
upon
the
man
breast
there
was
that
in
their
faces
which
made
garin
turn
away
he
felt
as
if
he
had
intruded
roughly
where
no
man
should
go
here
lies
thran
son
of
light
first
lord
of
the
caverns
and
his
lady
thrala
dweller
in
the
light
so
have
they
lain
a
thousand
thousand
years
and
so
will
they
lie
until
this
planet
rots
to
dust
beneath
them
they
led
the
folk
out
of
the
slime
and
made
tav
such
as
they
we
shall
never
see
again
they
passed
silently
down
the
aisles
of
the
dead
once
garin
caught
sight
of
another
man
perhaps
another
outlander
since
the
ancient
ones
were
all
dark
of
hair
urg
paused
once
more
before
they
left
the
hall
he
stood
by
the
couch
of
a
man
wrapped
in
a
long
robe
whose
face
was
ravaged
with
marks
of
agony
urg
spoke
a
single
name
thran
so
this
was
the
last
lord
of
the
caverns
garin
leaned
closer
to
study
the
dead
face
but
urg
seemed
to
have
lost
his
patience
he
hurried
his
charge
on
to
a
panel
door
this
is
the
southern
portal
of
the
caverns
he
explained
trust
to
the
ana
to
guide
you
and
beware
of
the
boiling
mud
should
the
morgels
scent
you
kill
quickly
they
are
the
servants
of
the
black
ones
may
fortune
favor
you
outlander
the
door
was
open
and
garin
looked
out
upon
tav
the
soft
blue
light
was
as
strong
as
it
had
been
when
he
had
first
seen
it
with
the
ana
perched
on
his
shoulder
the
green
rod
and
the
bag
of
food
in
his
hands
he
stepped
out
onto
the
moss
sod
urg
raised
his
hand
in
salute
and
the
door
clicked
into
place
garin
stood
alone
pledged
to
bring
the
daughter
out
of
the
caves
of
darkness
there
is
no
night
or
day
in
tav
since
the
blue
light
is
steady
but
the
folk
divide
their
time
by
artificial
means
however
garin
being
newly
come
from
the
rays
of
healing
felt
no
fatigue
as
he
hesitated
the
ana
chattered
and
pointed
confidently
ahead
before
them
was
a
dense
wood
of
fern
trees
it
was
quiet
in
the
forest
as
garin
made
his
way
into
its
gloom
and
for
the
first
time
he
noted
a
peculiarity
of
tav
there
were
no
birds
the
portion
of
the
woodland
they
had
to
traverse
was
but
a
spur
of
the
forest
to
the
west
after
an
hour
of
travel
they
came
out
upon
the
bank
of
a
sluggish
river
the
turbid
waters
of
the
stream
were
a
dull
saffron
color
this
thought
garin
must
be
the
river
of
gold
the
boundary
of
the
lands
of
the
black
ones
he
rounded
a
bend
to
come
upon
a
bridge
so
old
that
time
itself
had
worn
its
stone
angles
into
curves
the
bridge
gave
on
a
wide
plain
where
tall
grass
grew
sere
and
yellow
to
the
left
was
a
hissing
and
bubbling
and
a
huge
wave
of
boiling
mud
arose
in
the
air
garin
choked
in
a
wind
thick
with
chemicals
which
blew
from
it
he
smelled
and
tasted
the
air
all
across
the
plain
and
he
was
glad
enough
to
plunge
into
a
small
fern
grove
which
a
spring
there
he
bathed
his
head
and
arms
while
the
ana
pulled
open
sera
food
bag
together
they
ate
the
cakes
of
grain
and
the
dried
fruit
when
they
were
done
the
ana
tugged
at
garin
hand
and
pointed
on
cautiously
garin
wormed
his
way
through
the
thick
underbrush
until
at
last
he
looked
out
into
a
clearing
and
at
its
edge
the
entrance
of
the
black
ones
caves
two
tall
pillars
carved
into
the
likeness
of
foul
monsters
guarded
a
hole
a
fine
greenish
mist
whirled
and
danced
in
its
mouth
the
flyer
studied
the
entrance
there
was
no
life
to
be
seen
he
gripped
the
destroying
rod
and
inched
forward
before
the
green
mist
he
braced
himself
and
then
stepped
within
second
the
green
mist
enveloped
garin
he
drew
into
his
lungs
hot
moist
air
faintly
tinged
with
a
scent
of
sickly
sweetness
as
from
some
hidden
corruption
green
motes
in
the
air
gave
forth
little
light
and
seemed
to
cling
to
the
intruder
with
the
ana
pattering
before
him
the
american
started
down
a
steep
ramp
the
soft
soles
of
his
buskins
making
no
sound
at
regular
intervals
along
the
wall
niches
held
small
statues
and
about
each
perverted
figure
was
a
crown
of
green
motes
the
ana
stopped
its
large
ears
outspread
as
if
to
catch
the
faintest
murmur
of
sound
from
somewhere
under
the
earth
came
the
howls
of
a
maddened
dog
the
ana
shivered
creeping
closer
to
garin
down
led
the
ramp
growing
narrower
and
steeper
and
louder
sounded
the
insane
coughing
howls
of
the
dog
then
the
passage
was
abruptly
barred
by
a
grill
of
black
stone
garin
peered
through
its
bars
at
a
flight
of
stairs
leading
down
into
a
pit
from
the
pit
arose
snarling
laughter
padding
back
and
forth
were
things
which
might
have
been
conceived
by
demons
they
were
sleek
creatures
hairless
and
large
as
ponies
red
saliva
dripped
from
the
corners
of
their
sharp
jaws
but
in
the
eyes
which
they
raised
now
and
then
toward
the
grill
there
was
intelligence
these
were
the
morgels
watchdogs
and
slaves
of
the
black
ones
from
a
second
pair
of
stairs
directly
across
the
pit
arose
a
moaning
call
a
door
opened
and
two
men
came
down
the
steps
the
morgels
surged
forward
but
fell
back
when
whips
were
cracked
over
their
heads
the
masters
of
the
morgels
were
human
in
appearance
black
loin
cloths
were
twisted
about
them
and
long
cloaks
hung
from
their
shoulders
on
their
heads
completely
masking
their
hair
were
cloth
caps
which
bore
ragged
crests
not
unlike
cockscombs
as
far
as
garin
could
see
they
were
unarmed
except
for
their
whips
a
second
party
was
coming
down
the
steps
between
two
of
the
black
ones
struggled
a
prisoner
he
made
a
desperate
and
hopeless
fight
of
it
but
they
dragged
him
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
before
they
halted
the
morgels
intent
upon
their
promised
prey
crouched
before
them
five
steps
above
were
two
figures
to
whom
the
guards
looked
for
instructions
one
was
a
man
of
their
race
of
slender
handsome
body
and
evil
beautiful
face
his
hand
lay
possessively
upon
the
arm
of
his
companion
it
was
thrala
who
stood
beside
him
her
head
proudly
erect
the
laughter
curves
were
gone
from
her
lips
there
was
only
sorrow
and
resignation
to
be
read
there
now
but
her
spirit
burned
like
a
white
flame
in
her
eyes
look
her
warder
ordered
does
not
kepta
keep
his
promises
shall
we
give
dandtan
into
the
jaws
of
our
slaves
or
will
you
unsay
certain
words
of
yours
lady
thrala
the
prisoner
answered
for
her
kepta
son
of
vileness
thrala
is
not
for
you
remember
beloved
one
he
spoke
to
the
daughter
the
day
of
deliverance
is
at
hand
garin
felt
a
sudden
emptiness
the
prisoner
had
called
thrala
beloved
with
the
ease
of
one
who
had
the
right
i
await
thrala
answer
kepta
returned
evenly
and
her
answer
he
got
beast
among
beasts
you
may
send
dandtan
to
his
death
you
may
heap
all
manner
of
insult
and
evil
upon
me
but
still
i
say
the
daughter
is
not
for
your
touch
rather
will
i
cut
the
line
of
life
with
my
own
hands
taking
upon
me
the
punishment
of
the
elder
ones
to
dandtan
she
smiled
down
upon
the
prisoner
i
say
farewell
we
shall
meet
again
beyond
the
curtain
of
time
she
held
out
her
hands
to
him
thrala
dear
one
one
of
his
guards
slapped
a
hand
over
the
prisoner
mouth
putting
an
end
to
his
words
but
now
thrala
was
looking
beyond
him
straight
at
the
grill
which
sheltered
garin
kepta
pulled
at
her
arm
to
gain
her
attention
watch
thus
do
my
enemies
die
to
the
pit
with
him
the
guards
twisted
their
prisoner
around
and
the
morgels
crept
closer
their
eyes
fixed
upon
that
young
writhing
body
garin
knew
that
he
must
take
a
hand
in
the
game
the
ana
was
tugging
him
to
the
right
and
there
was
an
open
archway
leading
to
a
balcony
running
around
the
side
of
the
pit
those
below
were
too
entranced
by
the
coming
sport
to
notice
the
invader
but
thrala
glanced
up
and
garin
thought
that
she
sighted
him
something
in
her
attitude
attracted
kepta
he
too
looked
up
for
a
moment
he
stared
in
stark
amazement
and
then
he
thrust
the
daughter
through
the
door
behind
him
ho
outlander
welcome
to
the
caves
so
the
folk
have
meddled
greeting
kepta
garin
hardly
knew
whence
came
the
words
which
fell
so
easily
from
his
tongue
i
have
come
as
was
promised
to
remain
until
the
black
throne
is
no
more
not
even
the
morgels
boast
before
their
prey
lies
limp
in
their
jaws
flashed
kepta
what
manner
of
beast
are
you
a
clean
beast
kepta
which
you
are
not
bid
your
morgels
loose
the
youth
lest
i
grow
impatient
the
flyer
swung
the
green
rod
into
view
kepta
eyes
narrowed
but
his
smile
did
not
fade
i
have
heard
of
old
that
the
ancient
ones
do
not
destroy
as
an
outlander
i
am
not
bound
by
their
limits
returned
garin
as
you
will
learn
if
you
do
not
call
off
your
stinking
pack
the
master
of
the
caves
laughed
you
are
as
the
tand
a
fool
without
a
brain
never
shall
you
see
the
caverns
again
you
shall
own
me
master
yet
kepta
the
black
chief
seemed
to
consider
then
he
waved
to
his
men
release
him
he
ordered
outlander
you
are
braver
than
i
thought
we
might
bargain
thrala
goes
forth
from
the
caves
and
the
black
throne
is
dust
those
are
the
terms
of
the
caverns
and
if
we
do
not
accept
then
thrala
goes
forth
the
throne
is
dust
and
tav
shall
have
a
day
of
judging
such
as
it
has
never
seen
before
you
challenge
me
again
words
which
seemed
to
garin
to
have
their
origin
elsewhere
came
to
him
as
in
i
shall
take
before
kepta
could
reply
there
was
trouble
in
the
pit
dandtan
freed
by
his
guards
was
crossing
the
floor
in
running
leaps
garin
threw
himself
belly
down
on
the
balcony
and
dropped
the
jeweled
strap
of
his
belt
over
the
lip
a
moment
later
it
snapped
taut
and
he
stiffened
to
an
upward
pull
already
dandtan
heels
were
above
the
snapping
jaws
of
a
morgel
the
flyer
caught
the
youth
around
the
shoulders
and
heaved
they
rolled
together
against
the
wall
they
are
gone
all
of
them
dandtan
cried
as
he
regained
his
feet
he
was
right
the
morgels
howled
below
but
kepta
and
his
men
had
vanished
thrala
garin
exclaimed
dandtan
nodded
they
have
taken
her
back
to
the
cells
they
believe
her
safe
there
then
they
think
wrong
garin
stooped
to
pick
up
the
green
rod
his
companion
laughed
we
best
start
before
they
get
prepared
for
us
garin
picked
up
the
ana
which
way
dandtan
showed
him
a
passage
leading
from
behind
the
other
door
then
he
dodged
into
a
side
chamber
to
return
with
two
of
the
wing
cloaks
and
cloth
hoods
so
that
they
might
pass
as
black
ones
they
went
by
the
mouths
of
three
side
tunnels
all
deserted
none
disputed
their
going
all
the
black
ones
had
withdrawn
from
this
part
of
the
caves
dandtan
sniffed
uneasily
all
is
not
well
i
fear
a
trap
while
we
can
pass
let
us
the
passage
curved
to
the
right
and
they
came
into
an
oval
room
again
dandtan
shook
his
head
but
ventured
no
protest
instead
he
flung
open
a
door
and
hurried
down
a
short
hall
it
seemed
to
garin
that
there
were
strange
rustlings
and
squeakings
in
the
dark
corners
then
dandtan
stopped
so
short
that
the
flyer
ran
into
him
here
is
the
guard
room
and
it
is
empty
garin
looked
over
his
shoulder
into
a
large
room
racks
of
strange
weapons
hung
on
the
walls
and
the
sleeping
pallets
of
the
guards
were
stacked
evenly
but
the
men
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
they
crossed
the
room
and
passed
beneath
an
archway
even
the
bars
are
not
down
observed
dandtan
he
pointed
overhead
there
hung
a
portcullis
of
stone
garin
studied
it
apprehensively
but
dandtan
drew
him
on
into
a
narrow
corridor
where
were
barred
doors
the
cells
he
explained
and
withdrew
a
bar
across
one
door
the
portal
swung
back
and
they
pushed
within
thrala
arose
to
face
them
forgetting
the
disguise
he
wore
garin
drew
back
chilled
by
her
icy
demeanor
but
dandtan
sprang
forward
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
she
struggled
madly
until
she
saw
the
face
beneath
her
captor
hood
and
then
she
gave
a
cry
of
delight
and
her
arms
were
about
his
neck
dandtan
he
smiled
even
so
but
it
is
the
outlander
doing
she
came
to
the
american
studying
his
face
outlander
so
cold
a
name
is
not
for
you
when
you
have
served
us
so
she
offered
him
her
hands
and
he
raised
them
to
his
lips
and
how
are
you
named
dandtan
laughed
thus
the
eternal
curiosity
of
women
garin
garin
she
repeated
how
like
a
faint
rose
glowed
beneath
her
pearl
flesh
dandtan
hand
fell
lightly
upon
his
rescuer
shoulder
indeed
he
is
like
him
from
this
day
let
him
bear
that
other
name
garan
son
of
light
why
not
she
returned
calmly
after
all
the
reward
which
might
have
been
garan
may
be
his
tell
him
the
story
of
his
namesake
when
we
are
again
in
the
caverns
dandtan
was
interrupted
by
a
frightened
squeak
from
the
ana
then
came
a
mocking
voice
so
the
prey
has
entered
the
trap
of
its
own
will
how
many
hunters
may
boast
the
same
kepta
leaned
against
the
door
the
light
of
vicious
mischief
dancing
in
his
eyes
garin
dropped
his
cloak
to
the
floor
but
dandtan
must
have
read
what
was
in
the
flyer
mind
for
he
caught
him
by
the
arm
on
your
life
touch
him
not
so
you
have
learned
that
much
wisdom
while
you
have
dwelt
among
us
dandtan
would
that
thrala
had
done
the
same
but
fair
women
find
me
weak
he
eyed
her
proud
body
in
a
way
that
would
have
sent
garin
at
his
throat
had
dandtan
not
held
him
so
shall
thrala
have
a
second
chance
how
would
you
like
to
see
these
men
in
the
room
of
instruments
lady
i
do
not
fear
you
she
returned
thran
once
made
a
prophecy
and
he
never
spoke
idly
we
shall
win
free
that
will
be
as
fate
would
have
it
meanwhile
i
leave
you
to
each
other
he
whipped
around
the
door
and
slammed
it
behind
him
they
heard
the
grating
of
the
bar
he
slid
into
place
then
his
footsteps
died
away
there
goes
evil
murmured
thrala
softly
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
garin
had
killed
him
as
he
thought
to
do
we
must
get
away
garin
drew
the
rod
from
his
belt
the
green
gathered
and
clung
about
its
polished
length
touch
not
the
door
thrala
advised
only
its
hinges
beneath
the
tip
of
the
rod
the
stone
became
spongy
and
flaked
away
dandtan
and
the
flyer
caught
the
door
and
eased
it
to
the
floor
with
one
quick
movement
thrala
caught
up
garin
cloak
and
swirled
it
about
her
hiding
the
glitter
of
her
robe
there
was
a
curious
cold
lifelessness
about
the
air
of
the
corridor
the
motes
vanishing
as
if
blown
out
hurry
the
daughter
urged
kepta
is
withdrawing
the
living
light
so
that
we
will
have
to
wander
in
the
dark
when
they
reached
the
end
of
the
hall
the
light
was
quite
gone
and
garin
bruised
his
hands
against
the
stone
portcullis
which
had
been
lowered
from
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
barrier
came
rippling
laughter
oh
outlander
called
kepta
mockingly
you
will
get
through
easily
enough
when
you
remember
your
weapon
but
the
dark
you
can
not
conquer
so
easily
nor
that
which
runs
the
halls
garin
was
already
busy
with
the
rod
within
five
minutes
their
way
was
clear
again
but
thrala
stopped
them
when
they
would
have
gone
through
kepta
has
loosed
the
hunters
the
hunters
the
morgels
and
others
explained
dandtan
the
black
ones
have
withdrawn
and
only
death
comes
this
way
and
the
morgels
see
in
the
dark
so
does
the
ana
well
thought
of
agreed
the
son
of
the
ancient
ones
it
will
lead
us
out
as
if
in
answer
there
came
a
tug
at
garin
belt
reaching
back
he
caught
thrala
hand
and
knew
that
she
had
taken
dandtan
so
linked
they
crossed
the
guard
room
then
the
ana
paused
for
a
long
time
as
if
listening
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
the
darkness
which
hung
about
them
like
the
smothering
folds
of
a
curtain
something
follows
us
whispered
dandtan
nothing
to
fear
stated
thrala
it
dare
not
attack
it
is
i
think
of
kepta
fashioning
and
that
which
has
not
true
life
dreads
death
above
all
things
it
is
going
there
came
sounds
of
something
crawling
slowly
away
kepta
will
not
try
that
again
continued
the
daughter
disdainfully
he
knew
that
his
monstrosities
would
not
attack
only
in
the
light
are
they
to
be
dreaded
and
then
only
because
of
the
horror
of
their
forms
again
the
ana
tugged
at
its
master
belt
they
shuffled
into
the
narrow
passage
beyond
but
there
remained
the
sense
of
things
about
them
in
the
dark
things
which
thrala
continued
to
insist
were
harmless
and
yet
which
filled
garin
with
loathing
then
they
entered
the
far
corridor
into
which
led
the
three
halls
and
which
ended
in
the
morgel
pit
here
garin
believed
was
the
greatest
danger
from
the
morgels
the
ana
stopped
short
dropping
back
against
garin
thigh
in
the
blackness
appeared
two
yellow
disks
sparks
of
saffron
in
their
depths
garin
thrust
the
rod
into
thrala
hands
what
do
you
she
demanded
i
going
to
clear
the
way
it
too
dark
to
use
the
rod
against
moving
creatures
he
flung
the
words
over
his
shoulder
as
he
moved
toward
the
unwinking
eyes
from
the
keeping
his
eyes
upon
those
soulless
yellow
disks
garin
snatched
off
his
hood
wadding
it
into
a
ball
then
he
sprang
his
fingers
slipped
on
smooth
hide
sharp
fangs
ripped
his
forearm
blunt
nails
scraped
his
ribs
a
foul
breath
puffed
into
his
face
and
warm
slaver
trickled
down
his
neck
and
chest
but
his
plan
succeeded
the
cap
was
wedged
into
the
morgel
throat
and
the
beast
was
slowly
choking
blood
dripped
from
the
flyer
torn
flesh
but
he
held
on
grimly
until
he
saw
the
light
fade
from
those
yellow
eyes
the
dying
morgel
made
a
last
mad
plunge
for
freedom
dragging
his
attacker
along
the
rock
floor
then
garin
felt
the
heaving
body
rest
limply
against
his
own
he
staggered
against
the
wall
panting
garin
cried
thrala
her
questing
hand
touched
his
shoulder
and
crept
to
his
face
it
is
well
with
you
yes
he
panted
let
us
go
on
thrala
fingers
had
lingered
on
his
arm
and
now
she
walked
beside
him
her
cloak
making
whispering
sounds
as
it
brushed
against
the
wall
and
floor
wait
she
cautioned
suddenly
the
morgel
pit
dandtan
slipped
by
them
i
will
try
the
door
in
a
moment
he
was
back
it
is
open
he
whispered
kepta
believes
mused
thrala
that
we
will
keep
to
the
safety
of
the
gallery
therefore
let
us
go
through
the
pit
the
morgels
will
be
gone
to
better
hunting
grounds
through
the
pit
they
went
a
choking
stench
arose
from
underfoot
and
they
trod
very
carefully
they
climbed
the
stairs
on
the
far
side
unchallenged
dandtan
leading
the
rod
here
garin
he
called
this
door
is
barred
garin
pressed
the
weapon
into
the
other
hand
and
leaned
against
the
rock
he
was
sick
and
dizzy
the
long
deep
wounds
on
his
arm
and
shoulder
were
stiffening
and
ached
with
a
biting
throb
when
they
went
on
he
panted
with
effort
they
still
moved
in
darkness
and
his
distress
passed
unnoticed
this
is
wrong
he
muttered
half
to
himself
we
go
too
easily
and
he
was
answered
out
of
the
blackness
well
noted
outlander
but
you
go
free
for
the
moment
as
does
thrala
and
dandtan
our
full
accounting
is
not
yet
and
now
farewell
until
we
meet
again
in
the
hall
of
thrones
i
could
find
it
in
me
to
applaud
your
courage
outlander
perhaps
you
will
come
to
serve
me
yet
garin
turned
and
threw
himself
toward
the
voice
bringing
up
with
bruising
force
against
rock
wall
kepta
laughed
not
with
the
skill
of
the
bull
tand
will
you
capture
me
his
second
laugh
was
cut
cleanly
off
as
if
a
door
had
been
closed
in
silence
the
three
hurried
up
the
ramp
then
as
through
a
curtain
they
came
into
the
light
of
tav
thrala
let
fall
her
drab
cloak
stood
with
arms
outstretched
in
the
crater
land
her
sparkling
robe
sheathed
her
in
glory
and
she
sang
softly
rapt
in
her
own
delight
then
dandtan
put
his
arm
about
her
she
clung
to
him
staring
about
as
might
a
child
garin
wondered
dully
how
he
would
be
able
to
make
the
journey
back
to
the
caverns
when
his
arm
and
shoulder
were
eaten
with
a
consuming
fire
the
ana
crept
closer
to
him
peering
into
his
white
face
they
were
aroused
by
a
howl
from
the
caves
thrala
cried
out
and
dandtan
answered
her
unspoken
question
they
have
set
the
morgels
on
our
trail
the
howl
from
the
caves
was
echoed
from
the
forest
morgels
before
and
behind
them
garin
might
set
himself
against
one
dandtan
another
and
thrala
could
defend
herself
with
the
rod
but
in
the
end
the
pack
would
kill
them
we
shall
claim
protection
from
the
gibi
of
the
cliff
by
the
law
they
must
give
us
aid
said
thrala
as
turning
up
her
long
robe
she
began
to
run
lightly
garin
picked
up
her
cloak
and
drew
it
across
his
shoulder
to
hide
his
welts
when
he
could
no
longer
hold
her
pace
she
must
not
guess
the
reason
for
his
falling
behind
of
that
flight
through
the
forest
the
flyer
afterward
remembered
little
at
last
the
gurgle
of
water
broke
upon
his
pounding
ears
as
he
stumbled
along
a
good
ten
lengths
behind
his
companions
they
had
come
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
along
the
banks
of
the
river
without
hesitation
thrala
and
dandtan
plunged
into
the
oily
flood
swimming
easily
for
the
other
side
garin
dropped
the
cloak
wondering
if
once
he
stepped
into
the
yellow
stream
he
would
ever
be
able
to
struggle
out
again
already
the
ana
was
in
paddling
in
circles
near
the
shore
and
pleading
with
him
to
follow
wearily
garin
waded
out
the
water
which
washed
the
blood
and
sweat
from
his
aching
body
was
faintly
brackish
and
stung
his
wounds
to
life
he
could
not
fight
the
sluggish
current
and
it
bore
him
downstream
well
away
from
where
the
others
landed
but
at
last
he
managed
to
win
free
crawling
out
near
where
a
smaller
stream
joined
the
river
there
he
lay
panting
face
down
upon
the
moss
and
there
they
found
him
water
dripping
from
his
bedraggled
finery
the
ana
stroking
his
muddied
hair
thrala
cried
out
with
concern
and
pillowed
his
head
on
her
knees
while
dandtan
examined
his
wounds
why
did
you
not
tell
us
demanded
thrala
he
did
not
try
to
answer
content
to
lie
there
her
arms
supporting
him
dandtan
disappeared
into
the
forest
returning
soon
his
hands
filled
with
a
mass
of
crushed
leaves
with
these
he
plastered
garin
wounds
you
better
go
on
garin
warned
dandtan
shook
his
head
the
morgels
can
not
swim
if
they
cross
they
must
go
to
the
bridge
and
that
is
half
the
crater
away
the
ana
dropped
into
their
midst
its
small
hands
filled
with
clusters
of
purple
fruit
and
so
they
feasted
garin
at
ease
on
a
fern
couch
accepting
food
from
thrala
hand
there
seemed
to
be
some
virtue
in
dandtan
leaf
plaster
for
after
a
short
rest
garin
was
able
to
get
to
his
feet
with
no
more
than
a
twinge
or
two
in
his
wounds
but
they
started
on
at
a
more
sober
pace
through
mossy
glens
and
sunlit
glades
where
strange
flowers
made
perfume
the
trail
led
the
stream
they
followed
branched
twice
before
on
the
edge
of
meadow
land
they
struck
away
from
the
guiding
water
toward
the
crater
wall
suddenly
thrala
threw
back
her
head
and
gave
a
shrill
sweet
whistle
out
of
the
air
dropped
a
yellow
and
black
insect
as
large
as
a
hawk
twice
it
circled
her
head
and
then
perched
itself
on
her
outstretched
wrist
its
swollen
body
was
jet
black
its
curving
legs
three
to
a
side
chrome
yellow
the
round
head
ended
in
a
sharp
beak
and
it
had
large
eyes
the
wings
which
lazily
tested
the
air
were
black
and
touched
with
gold
thrala
rubbed
the
round
head
while
the
insect
nuzzled
affectionately
at
her
cheek
then
she
held
out
her
wrist
again
and
it
was
gone
we
shall
be
expected
now
and
may
pass
unmolested
shortly
they
became
aware
of
a
murmuring
sound
the
crater
wall
loomed
ahead
dwarfing
the
trees
at
its
base
there
is
the
city
of
the
gibi
remarked
dandtan
clinging
to
the
rock
were
the
towers
and
turrets
of
many
cells
they
are
preparing
for
the
mists
observed
thrala
we
shall
have
company
on
our
journey
to
the
caverns
they
passed
the
trees
and
reached
the
foot
of
the
wax
skyscrapers
which
towered
dizzily
above
their
heads
a
great
cloud
of
the
gibi
hovered
about
them
garin
felt
the
soft
brush
of
their
wings
against
his
body
and
they
crowded
each
other
jealously
to
be
near
thrala
the
soft
of
their
wings
filled
the
clearing
as
one
large
gibi
of
outstanding
beauty
approached
the
commoners
fluttered
off
and
thrala
greeted
the
queen
of
the
cells
as
an
equal
then
she
turned
to
her
companions
with
the
information
the
gibi
queen
had
to
offer
we
are
just
in
time
tomorrow
the
gibi
leave
the
morgels
have
crossed
the
river
and
are
out
of
control
instead
of
hunting
us
they
have
gone
to
ravage
the
forest
lands
all
tav
has
been
warned
against
them
but
they
may
be
caught
by
the
mist
and
so
destroyed
we
are
to
rest
in
the
cliff
hollows
and
one
shall
come
for
us
when
it
is
time
to
leave
the
gibi
withdrew
to
the
after
conducting
their
guests
to
the
of
garin
was
awakened
by
a
loud
murmuring
dandtan
knelt
beside
him
we
must
go
even
now
the
gibi
seal
the
last
of
the
cells
they
ate
hurriedly
of
cakes
of
grain
and
honey
and
as
they
feasted
the
queen
again
visited
them
the
first
of
the
swarm
were
already
winging
eastward
with
the
gibi
nation
hanging
like
a
storm
cloud
above
them
the
three
started
off
across
the
meadow
the
haze
was
thickening
and
here
and
there
curious
formations
like
the
dust
devils
of
the
desert
arose
and
danced
and
disappeared
again
the
tropic
heat
of
tav
increased
it
was
as
if
the
ground
itself
were
steaming
the
mists
draw
close
we
must
hurry
panted
dandtan
they
traversed
the
tongue
of
forest
which
bordered
the
meadow
and
came
to
the
central
plain
of
tav
there
was
a
brooding
stillness
there
the
ana
perched
on
garin
shoulder
shivered
their
walk
became
a
trot
the
gibi
bunched
together
once
thrala
caught
her
breath
in
a
half
sob
they
are
flying
slowly
because
of
us
and
it
so
far
look
dandtan
pointed
at
the
plain
the
morgels
the
morgel
pack
driven
by
fear
ran
in
leaping
bounds
they
passed
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
three
yet
did
not
turn
from
their
course
though
several
snarled
at
them
they
are
already
dead
observed
dandtan
there
is
no
time
for
them
to
reach
the
shelter
of
the
caves
splashing
through
a
shallow
brook
the
three
began
to
run
for
the
first
time
thrala
faltered
and
broke
pace
garin
thrust
the
ana
into
arms
and
before
she
could
protest
swept
the
girl
into
his
arms
the
haze
was
denser
now
settling
upon
them
as
a
curtain
black
hair
finer
than
silk
whipped
across
garin
throat
thrala
head
was
on
his
shoulder
her
heaving
breasts
arched
as
she
gasped
the
sultry
air
they
keep
watch
shouted
dandtan
piercing
the
gloom
were
of
light
a
dark
shape
grazed
head
one
of
the
gibi
queen
guards
then
abruptly
they
stumbled
into
a
throng
of
the
folk
one
of
whom
reached
for
thrala
with
a
crooning
cry
it
was
sera
welcoming
her
mistress
thrala
was
borne
away
by
the
women
leaving
garin
with
a
feeling
of
desolation
the
mists
outlander
it
was
urg
pointing
toward
the
cavern
mouth
two
of
the
folk
swung
their
weight
on
a
lever
across
the
opening
a
sheet
of
crystal
clicked
into
place
the
caverns
were
sealed
the
haze
was
now
inky
black
outside
and
billows
of
it
beat
against
the
protecting
barrier
it
might
have
been
midnight
of
the
blackest
starless
night
so
will
it
be
for
forty
days
what
is
without
dies
said
urg
then
we
have
forty
days
in
which
to
prepare
garin
spoke
his
thought
aloud
dandtan
keen
face
lightened
well
said
garin
forty
days
before
kepta
may
seek
us
and
we
have
much
to
do
but
first
our
respects
to
the
lord
of
the
folk
together
they
went
to
the
hall
of
thrones
where
when
he
saw
dandtan
trar
arose
and
held
out
his
rod
of
office
the
son
of
the
ancient
ones
touched
it
hail
dweller
in
the
light
and
outlander
who
has
fulfilled
the
promise
of
thran
thrala
is
once
more
within
the
caverns
now
send
you
to
dust
this
black
throne
garin
nothing
loath
drew
the
destroying
rod
from
his
belt
but
dandtan
shook
his
head
the
time
is
not
yet
trar
kepta
must
finish
the
pattern
he
began
forty
days
have
we
and
then
the
black
ones
come
trar
considered
thoughtfully
so
that
be
the
way
of
it
thran
did
not
see
another
war
but
he
saw
an
end
to
kepta
trar
straightened
as
if
some
burden
had
rolled
from
his
thin
shoulders
well
do
you
speak
lord
when
there
is
one
to
sit
upon
the
rose
throne
what
have
we
to
fear
listen
o
ye
folk
the
light
has
returned
to
the
caverns
his
cry
was
echoed
by
the
gathering
of
the
folk
and
now
lord
he
turned
to
dandtan
with
deference
what
are
your
commands
for
the
space
of
one
sleep
i
shall
enter
the
chamber
of
renewing
with
this
outlander
who
is
no
longer
an
outlander
but
one
garin
accepted
by
the
daughter
according
to
the
law
and
while
we
rest
let
all
be
made
ready
the
dweller
in
the
light
has
spoken
trar
himself
escorted
them
from
the
hall
they
came
through
many
winding
passages
to
a
deep
pool
of
water
in
the
depths
of
which
lurked
odd
purple
shadows
dandtan
stripped
and
plunged
in
garin
following
his
example
the
water
was
tinglingly
alive
and
they
did
not
linger
in
it
long
from
it
they
went
to
a
bubble
room
such
as
the
one
garin
had
rested
in
after
the
bath
of
light
rays
and
on
the
cushions
in
its
center
stretched
their
tired
bodies
when
garin
awoke
he
experienced
the
same
exultation
he
had
felt
before
dandtan
regarded
him
with
a
smile
now
to
work
he
said
as
he
reached
out
to
press
a
knob
set
in
the
wall
two
of
the
folk
appeared
bringing
with
them
clean
trappings
after
they
dressed
and
broke
their
fast
dandtan
started
for
the
laboratories
garin
would
have
gone
with
him
but
sera
intercepted
them
there
is
one
would
speak
with
lord
garin
dandtan
laughed
go
he
ordered
the
american
thrala
commands
may
not
be
slighted
the
hall
of
women
was
deserted
and
the
corridor
beyond
roofed
and
walled
with
slabs
of
crystal
was
as
empty
sera
drew
aside
a
golden
curtain
and
they
were
in
the
audience
chamber
of
the
daughter
a
dais
of
the
clearest
crystal
heaped
with
rose
and
gold
cushions
faced
them
before
it
a
fountain
in
the
form
of
a
flower
nodding
on
a
curved
stem
sent
a
spray
of
water
into
a
shallow
basin
the
walls
of
the
room
were
divided
into
alcoves
by
marble
pillars
each
one
curved
in
semblance
of
a
fern
frond
from
the
domed
ceiling
on
chains
of
twisted
gold
seven
lamps
each
wrought
from
a
single
yellow
sapphire
gave
soft
light
the
floor
was
a
mosaic
of
gold
and
crystal
two
small
anas
who
had
been
playing
among
the
cushions
pattered
up
to
exchange
greetings
with
garin
but
of
the
mistress
of
the
chamber
there
was
no
sign
garin
turned
to
sera
but
before
he
could
phrase
his
question
she
asked
mockingly
who
is
the
lord
garin
that
he
can
not
wait
with
patience
but
she
left
in
search
of
the
daughter
garin
glanced
uneasily
about
the
room
this
jeweled
chamber
was
no
place
for
him
he
had
started
toward
the
door
when
thrala
stepped
within
greetings
to
the
daughter
his
voice
sounded
formal
and
cold
even
to
himself
her
hands
which
had
been
outheld
in
welcome
dropped
to
her
sides
a
ghost
of
a
frown
dimmed
her
beauty
greetings
garin
she
returned
slowly
you
sent
for
me
he
prompted
eager
to
escape
from
this
jewel
box
and
the
unattainable
treasure
it
held
yes
the
coldness
of
her
tone
was
an
order
of
exile
i
would
know
how
you
fared
and
whether
your
wounds
yet
troubled
you
he
looked
down
at
his
own
smooth
flesh
cleanly
healed
by
the
wisdom
of
the
folk
i
am
myself
again
and
eager
to
be
at
such
work
as
dandtan
can
find
for
me
her
robe
seemed
to
hiss
across
the
floor
as
she
turned
upon
him
then
go
she
ordered
go
quickly
and
blindly
he
obeyed
she
had
spoken
as
if
to
a
servant
one
whom
she
could
summon
and
dismiss
by
whim
even
if
dandtan
held
her
love
she
might
have
extended
him
her
friendship
but
he
knew
within
him
that
friendship
would
be
a
poor
crumb
beside
the
feast
his
pulses
pounded
for
there
was
a
pattering
of
feet
behind
him
so
she
would
call
him
back
his
pride
sent
him
on
but
it
was
sera
her
head
thrust
forward
until
she
truly
resembled
a
reptile
fool
morgel
she
spat
even
the
black
ones
did
not
treat
her
so
get
you
out
of
the
place
of
women
lest
they
divide
your
skin
among
them
garin
broke
free
not
heeding
her
torrent
of
reproach
then
he
seized
upon
one
of
the
folk
as
a
guide
and
sought
the
laboratories
far
beneath
the
surface
of
tav
where
the
shone
ghostly
in
the
gloom
they
came
into
a
place
of
ceaseless
activity
where
there
were
tables
crowded
with
instruments
coils
of
glass
and
metal
tubing
and
other
equipment
and
supplies
these
were
the
focusing
point
for
ceaseless
streams
of
the
folk
on
a
platform
at
the
far
end
garin
saw
the
tall
son
of
the
ancient
ones
working
on
a
framework
of
metal
and
shining
crystal
he
glanced
up
as
garin
joined
him
you
are
late
he
accused
but
your
excuse
is
a
good
one
now
get
you
to
work
hold
this
here
and
here
while
i
fasten
these
clamps
so
garin
became
extra
hands
and
feet
for
dandtan
and
they
worked
feverishly
to
build
against
the
lifting
of
the
mists
there
was
no
day
or
night
in
the
laboratories
they
worked
steadily
without
rest
and
without
feeling
fatigue
twice
they
went
to
the
chamber
of
renewing
but
except
for
these
trips
to
the
upper
ways
they
were
not
out
of
the
laboratories
through
all
those
days
of
thrala
there
was
no
sign
nor
did
any
one
speak
of
her
the
cavern
dwellers
were
depending
upon
two
defenses
an
evil
green
liquid
to
be
thrown
in
frail
glass
globes
and
a
screen
charged
with
energy
shortly
before
the
lifting
of
the
mists
these
arms
were
transported
to
the
entrance
and
installed
there
dandtan
and
garin
made
a
last
inspection
kepta
makes
the
mistake
of
his
enemies
dandtan
reflected
feeling
the
edge
of
the
screen
caressingly
when
i
was
captured
on
the
day
my
people
died
i
was
sent
to
the
black
laboratories
so
that
their
seekers
after
knowledge
might
learn
the
secrets
of
the
ancient
ones
but
i
proved
a
better
pupil
than
teacher
and
i
discovered
the
defense
against
the
black
fire
after
i
had
learned
that
kepta
grew
impatient
with
my
supposed
stupidity
and
tried
to
use
me
to
force
thrala
to
his
will
for
that
as
for
other
things
shall
he
pay
and
the
paying
will
not
be
in
coin
of
his
own
striking
let
us
think
of
that
he
turned
to
greet
urg
and
trar
and
the
other
leaders
of
the
folk
who
had
approached
unnoticed
among
them
stood
thrala
her
gaze
fixed
upon
the
crystal
wall
between
them
and
the
thinning
mist
she
noticed
garin
no
more
than
she
did
the
anas
playing
with
her
train
and
the
women
whispering
behind
her
but
garin
stepped
back
into
the
shadows
and
what
he
saw
was
not
weapons
of
war
but
cloudy
black
hair
and
graceful
white
limbs
veiled
in
splendor
urg
and
one
of
the
other
chieftains
bore
down
upon
the
door
lever
with
a
protesting
squeak
the
glass
wall
disappeared
into
the
rock
the
green
of
tav
beckoned
them
out
to
walk
in
its
freshness
it
was
renewed
with
lusty
life
but
in
all
that
expanse
of
meadow
and
forest
there
was
a
strange
stillness
post
sentries
ordered
dandtan
the
black
ones
will
come
soon
he
beckoned
garin
forward
as
he
spoke
to
thrala
let
us
go
to
the
hall
of
thrones
but
the
daughter
did
not
answer
his
smile
it
is
not
meet
that
we
should
spend
time
in
idle
talk
let
us
go
instead
to
call
upon
the
help
of
those
who
have
gone
before
us
so
speaking
she
darted
a
glance
at
garin
as
chill
as
the
arctic
lands
beyond
the
lip
of
tav
and
then
swept
away
with
sera
bearing
her
train
dandtan
stared
at
garin
what
has
happened
between
you
two
the
flyer
shook
his
head
i
do
know
no
man
is
born
with
an
understanding
of
women
but
she
is
angered
with
you
what
has
happened
for
a
moment
garin
was
tempted
to
tell
the
truth
that
he
dared
not
break
any
barrier
she
chose
to
raise
lest
he
seize
what
in
honor
was
none
of
his
but
he
shook
his
head
mutely
neither
of
them
saw
thrala
again
until
death
entered
the
caverns
and
garin
stood
with
dandtan
looking
out
into
the
plain
of
tav
some
distance
away
were
two
slender
towers
which
were
in
reality
but
hollow
tubes
filled
with
the
black
fire
before
these
figures
were
busy
they
seem
to
believe
us
already
defeated
let
them
think
so
commented
dandtan
touching
the
screen
they
had
erected
before
the
cavern
entrance
as
he
spoke
kepta
swaggered
through
the
tall
grass
to
call
a
greeting
ho
rock
dweller
i
would
speak
with
you
dandtan
edged
around
the
screen
garin
a
pace
behind
i
see
you
kepta
good
i
trust
that
your
ears
will
serve
you
as
well
as
your
eyes
these
are
my
terms
give
thrala
to
me
to
dwell
in
my
chamber
and
the
outlander
to
provide
sport
for
my
captains
make
no
resistance
but
throw
open
the
caverns
so
that
i
may
take
my
rightful
place
in
the
hall
of
thrones
do
this
and
we
shall
be
at
peace
and
this
is
our
reply
dandtan
stood
unmovingly
before
the
screen
return
to
the
caves
break
down
the
bridge
between
your
land
and
ours
let
no
black
one
come
hither
again
ever
kepta
laughed
so
that
be
the
way
of
it
then
this
shall
we
do
take
thrala
to
be
mine
for
a
space
and
then
to
go
to
my
captains
garin
hurled
himself
forward
felt
kepta
lips
mash
beneath
his
fist
his
fingers
were
closing
about
the
other
throat
as
dandtan
who
was
trying
to
pull
him
away
from
his
prey
shouted
a
warning
watch
out
a
morgel
had
leaped
from
the
grass
its
teeth
snapping
about
wrist
forcing
him
to
drop
kepta
then
dandtan
laid
it
senseless
by
a
sharp
blow
with
his
belt
on
hands
and
knees
kepta
crawled
back
to
his
men
the
lower
part
of
his
face
was
a
red
and
dripping
smear
he
screamed
an
order
with
savage
fury
dandtan
drew
the
still
raging
flyer
behind
the
screen
be
a
little
prudent
he
panted
kepta
can
be
dealt
with
in
other
ways
than
with
bare
hands
the
towers
were
swinging
their
tips
toward
the
entrance
dandtan
ordered
the
screen
wedged
tightly
into
place
outside
the
morgel
dandtan
had
stunned
got
groggily
to
its
feet
when
it
had
limped
half
the
distance
back
to
its
master
kepta
gave
the
order
to
fire
the
broad
beam
of
black
light
from
the
tip
of
the
nearest
tower
caught
the
beast
head
on
there
was
a
chilling
scream
of
agony
and
where
the
morgel
had
stood
gray
ashes
drifted
on
the
wind
a
hideous
crackling
arose
as
the
black
beam
struck
the
screen
green
grass
beneath
seared
away
leaving
only
parched
earth
and
naked
blue
soil
those
within
the
cavern
crouched
behind
their
frail
protection
half
blinded
by
the
light
from
the
seared
grass
coughing
from
the
fumes
which
curled
about
the
cracks
of
the
rock
then
the
beam
faded
out
thin
smoke
plumed
from
the
tips
of
the
towers
steam
arose
from
the
blackened
ground
dandtan
drew
a
deep
breath
it
held
he
cried
betraying
at
last
the
fear
which
had
ridden
him
men
of
the
folk
dragged
engines
of
tubing
before
the
screen
while
others
brought
forth
the
globes
of
green
liquid
dandtan
stood
aside
as
if
this
matter
were
the
business
of
the
folk
alone
and
garin
recalled
that
the
ancient
ones
were
opposed
to
the
taking
of
life
trar
was
in
command
now
at
his
orders
the
globes
were
posed
on
holders
loopholes
in
the
screen
clicked
open
trar
brought
down
his
hand
in
signal
the
globes
arose
lazily
sliding
through
the
loopholes
and
floating
out
toward
the
towers
one
aimed
short
struck
the
ground
where
the
fire
had
burned
it
bare
and
broke
the
liquid
came
forth
sluggishly
forming
a
gas
as
the
air
struck
it
another
spiral
of
gas
arose
almost
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
towers
and
then
another
and
another
there
quickly
followed
a
tortured
screaming
which
soon
dwindled
to
a
weak
yammering
they
could
see
shapes
no
longer
human
or
animal
staggering
about
in
the
fog
dandtan
turned
away
his
face
white
with
horror
garin
hands
were
over
his
ears
to
shut
out
that
crying
at
last
it
was
quiet
there
was
no
more
movement
by
the
towers
urg
placed
a
sphere
of
rosy
light
upon
the
nearest
machine
and
flipped
it
out
into
the
camp
of
the
enemy
as
if
it
were
a
magnet
it
drew
the
green
tendrils
of
gas
to
leave
the
air
clear
here
and
there
lay
shrunken
livid
shapes
the
towers
brooding
over
them
one
of
the
folk
burst
into
their
midst
a
woman
of
thrala
following
haste
she
clawed
at
garin
kepta
takes
thrala
she
ran
wildly
back
the
way
she
had
come
with
the
american
pounding
at
her
heels
they
burst
into
the
hall
of
thrones
and
saw
a
struggling
group
before
the
dais
garin
heard
someone
howl
like
an
animal
became
aware
the
sound
came
from
his
own
throat
for
the
second
time
his
fist
found
its
mark
on
kepta
face
with
a
shriek
of
rage
the
black
one
threw
thrala
from
him
and
sprang
at
garin
his
nails
tearing
gashes
in
the
flyer
face
twice
the
american
twisted
free
and
sent
blows
into
the
ribs
then
he
got
the
grip
he
wanted
and
his
fingers
closed
around
kepta
throat
in
spite
of
the
black
one
struggles
he
held
on
until
a
limp
body
rolled
beneath
him
panting
the
american
pulled
himself
up
from
the
floor
and
grabbed
the
arm
of
the
jade
throne
for
support
garin
thrala
arms
were
about
him
her
pitying
fingers
on
his
wounds
and
in
that
moment
he
forgot
dandtan
forgot
everything
he
had
steeled
himself
to
remember
she
was
in
his
arms
and
his
mouth
sought
hers
possessively
nor
was
she
unresponsive
but
yielded
as
a
flower
yields
to
the
wind
garin
she
whispered
softly
then
almost
shyly
she
broke
from
his
hold
beyond
her
stood
dandtan
his
face
white
his
mouth
tight
garin
remembered
and
a
little
mad
with
pain
and
longing
he
dropped
his
eyes
trying
not
to
see
the
loveliness
which
was
thrala
so
outlander
thrala
flies
to
your
arms
garin
whirled
about
kepta
was
hunched
on
the
broad
seat
of
the
jet
throne
no
i
am
not
dead
outlander
nor
shall
you
kill
me
as
you
think
to
do
i
go
now
but
i
shall
return
we
have
met
and
hated
fought
and
died
before
you
and
i
you
were
a
certain
garan
marshall
of
the
air
fleet
of
on
a
vanished
world
and
i
was
lord
of
koom
that
was
in
the
days
before
the
ancient
ones
pioneered
space
you
and
i
and
thrala
we
are
bound
together
and
even
fate
can
not
break
those
bonds
farewell
garin
and
do
you
thrala
remember
the
ending
of
that
other
garan
it
was
not
an
easy
one
with
a
last
malicious
chuckle
he
leaned
back
in
the
throne
his
battered
body
slumped
then
the
sharp
lines
of
the
throne
blurred
it
shimmered
in
the
light
abruptly
then
both
it
and
its
occupant
were
gone
they
were
staring
at
empty
space
above
which
loomed
the
rose
throne
of
the
ancient
ones
he
spoke
true
murmured
thrala
we
have
had
other
lives
other
meetings
so
will
we
meet
again
but
for
the
present
he
returns
to
the
darkness
which
sent
him
forth
it
is
finished
without
warning
a
low
rumbling
filled
the
cavern
the
walls
rocked
and
swayed
lizard
and
human
they
huddled
together
until
the
swaying
stopped
finally
a
runner
appeared
with
news
that
one
of
the
gibi
had
ventured
forth
and
discovered
that
the
caves
of
darkness
had
been
sealed
by
an
underground
quake
the
menace
of
the
black
ones
was
definitely
at
an
end
although
there
were
falls
of
rock
within
the
caverns
and
some
of
the
passages
were
closed
few
of
the
folk
suffered
injury
gibi
scouts
reported
that
the
land
about
the
entrance
to
the
caves
had
sunk
and
that
the
river
of
gold
thrown
out
of
its
bed
was
fast
filling
this
basin
to
form
a
lake
as
far
as
they
could
discover
none
of
the
black
ones
had
survived
the
battle
and
the
sealing
of
the
caves
but
they
could
not
be
sure
that
there
was
not
a
handful
of
outlaws
somewhere
within
the
confines
of
tav
the
crater
itself
was
changed
a
series
of
raw
hills
had
appeared
in
the
central
plain
the
pool
of
boiling
mud
had
vanished
and
trees
in
the
forest
lay
flat
as
if
cut
by
a
giant
scythe
upon
their
return
to
the
cliff
city
the
gibi
found
most
of
their
wax
skyscrapers
in
ruins
but
they
set
about
rebuilding
without
complaint
the
squirrel
farmers
emerged
from
their
burrows
and
were
again
busy
in
the
fields
garin
felt
out
of
place
in
all
the
activity
that
filled
the
caverns
more
than
ever
he
was
the
outlander
with
no
true
roots
in
tav
restlessly
he
explored
the
caverns
spending
many
hours
in
the
place
of
ancestors
where
he
studied
those
men
of
the
outer
world
who
had
preceded
him
into
this
weird
land
one
night
when
he
came
back
to
his
chamber
he
found
dandtan
and
trar
awaiting
him
there
there
was
a
curious
hardness
in
dandtan
attitude
a
somber
sobriety
in
trar
carriage
have
you
sought
the
hall
of
women
since
the
battle
demanded
the
son
of
the
ancient
ones
abruptly
no
retorted
garin
shortly
did
dandtan
accuse
him
of
double
dealing
have
you
sent
a
message
to
thrala
garin
held
back
his
rising
temper
i
have
not
ventured
where
i
can
not
dandtan
nodded
to
trar
as
if
his
suspicions
had
been
confirmed
you
see
how
it
stands
trar
trar
shook
his
head
slowly
but
never
has
the
summoning
been
at
fault
you
forget
dandtan
reminded
him
sharply
it
was
once
and
the
penalty
was
exacted
so
shall
it
be
again
garin
looked
from
one
to
the
other
confused
dandtan
seemed
possessed
of
a
certain
ruthless
anger
but
trar
was
manifestly
unhappy
it
must
come
after
council
the
daughter
willing
the
lord
of
the
folk
said
dandtan
strode
toward
the
door
thrala
is
not
to
know
assemble
the
council
tonight
meanwhile
see
that
he
he
jerked
his
thumb
toward
garin
does
not
leave
this
room
thus
garin
became
a
prisoner
under
the
guard
of
the
folk
unable
to
discover
of
what
dandtan
accused
him
or
how
he
had
aroused
the
hatred
of
the
cavern
ruler
unless
dandtan
jealousy
had
been
aroused
and
he
was
determined
to
rid
himself
of
a
rival
believing
this
the
flyer
went
willingly
to
the
chamber
where
the
judges
waited
dandtan
sat
at
the
head
of
a
long
table
trar
at
his
right
hand
and
lesser
nobles
of
the
folk
beyond
you
know
the
charge
dandtan
words
were
tipped
with
venom
as
garin
came
to
stand
before
him
out
of
his
own
mouth
has
this
outlander
condemned
himself
therefore
i
ask
that
you
decree
for
him
the
fate
of
that
outlander
of
the
second
calling
who
rebelled
against
the
summoning
the
outlander
has
admitted
his
fault
questioned
one
of
the
folk
trar
inclined
his
head
sadly
he
did
as
garin
opened
his
mouth
to
demand
a
stating
of
the
charge
against
him
dandtan
spoke
again
what
say
you
lords
for
a
long
moment
they
sat
in
silence
and
then
they
bobbed
their
lizard
heads
in
assent
do
as
you
desire
dweller
in
the
light
dandtan
smiled
without
mirth
look
outlander
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
glass
of
the
seeing
mirror
set
in
the
table
top
this
is
the
fate
of
him
who
rebels
in
the
shining
surface
garin
saw
pictured
a
break
in
tav
wall
at
its
foot
stood
a
group
of
men
of
the
ancient
ones
and
in
their
midst
struggled
a
prisoner
they
were
forcing
him
to
climb
the
crater
wall
garin
watched
him
reach
the
lip
and
crawl
over
to
stagger
across
the
steaming
rock
dodging
the
scalding
vapor
of
hot
springs
until
he
pitched
face
down
in
the
slimy
mud
such
was
his
ending
and
so
will
you
end
the
calm
brutality
of
that
statement
aroused
garin
anger
rather
would
i
die
that
way
than
linger
in
this
den
he
cried
hotly
you
who
owe
your
life
to
me
would
send
me
to
such
a
death
without
even
telling
me
of
what
i
am
accused
little
is
there
to
choose
between
you
and
kepta
after
all
except
that
he
was
an
open
enemy
dandtan
sprang
to
his
feet
but
trar
caught
his
arm
he
speaks
fairly
ask
him
why
he
will
not
fulfill
the
summoning
while
dandtan
hesitated
garin
leaned
across
the
table
flinging
his
words
straight
into
that
cold
face
i
admit
that
i
love
thrala
have
loved
her
since
that
moment
when
i
saw
her
on
the
steps
of
the
morgel
pit
in
the
caves
since
when
has
it
become
a
crime
to
love
that
which
may
not
be
yours
if
you
do
not
try
to
take
it
trar
released
dandtan
his
golden
eyes
gleaming
if
you
love
her
claim
her
it
is
your
right
do
i
not
know
garin
turned
to
him
that
she
is
dandtan
thran
had
no
idea
of
dandtan
survival
when
he
laid
his
will
upon
her
shall
i
stoop
to
holding
her
to
an
unwelcome
bargain
let
her
go
to
the
one
she
loves
dandtan
face
was
livid
and
his
hands
resting
on
the
table
trembled
one
by
one
the
lords
of
the
folk
slipped
away
leaving
the
two
and
i
thought
to
order
you
to
your
death
dandtan
whisper
was
husky
as
it
emerged
between
dry
lips
garin
we
thought
you
knew
and
knowing
had
refused
her
knew
what
that
i
am
thran
son
and
thrala
brother
the
floor
swung
beneath
garin
unsteady
feet
dandtan
hands
were
warm
on
his
shoulders
i
am
a
fool
said
the
american
slowly
dandtan
smiled
a
very
honorable
fool
now
get
you
to
thrala
who
deserves
to
hear
the
full
of
this
tangle
so
it
was
that
with
dandtan
by
his
side
garin
walked
for
the
second
time
down
that
hallway
to
pass
the
golden
curtains
and
stand
in
the
presence
of
the
daughter
she
came
straight
from
her
cushions
into
his
arms
when
she
read
what
was
in
his
face
they
needed
no
words
and
in
that
hour
began
garin
