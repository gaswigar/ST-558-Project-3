these
tales
are
written
in
an
english
dialect
none
the
less
a
dialect
for
that
it
lacks
uniformity
in
the
misplacement
of
aspirates
and
lacks
too
strange
words
misunderstanded
of
the
reader
in
south
kent
villages
with
names
ending
in
and
out
away
on
the
sussex
downs
where
villages
end
in
live
the
plain
people
who
talk
this
plain
speech
a
speech
that
should
be
sweeter
in
english
ears
than
the
implacable
consonants
of
a
northern
or
the
soft
talk
of
western
hillsides
all
through
the
summer
nights
the
market
carts
creak
along
the
london
road
to
london
go
the
wild
young
man
and
the
steady
young
man
who
himself
to
london
goes
the
girl
seeking
a
the
comes
very
near
to
this
land
so
near
that
across
its
marches
you
may
hear
the
sackbut
and
shawm
from
the
breaks
once
a
year
come
the
hoppers
and
so
the
cup
of
the
hills
holds
no
untroubled
pool
of
pastoral
speech
this
book
therefore
is
of
no
value
to
a
middle
english
scholar

needs

my
cousin
sarah
and
me
had
only
one
aunt
between
us
and
that
was
my
aunt
maria
who
lived
in
the
little
cottage
up
by
the
church
now
my
aunt
had
a
tidy
little
bit
of
money
laid
by
which
she
could
in
reason
expect
to
carry
with
her
when
her
time
came
to
go
wherever
it
was
she
might
go
to
and
a
houseful
of
furniture
but
strong
and
good
still
so
of
course
sarah
and
i
were
not
behindhand
in
going
up
to
see
the
old
lady
and
taking
her
a
pot
or
so
of
jam
in
fruiting
season
or
a
turnover
maybe
on
a
if
the
oven
had
been
steady
and
the
baking
turned
out
well
and
you
could
have
told
from
aunt
manner
which
of
us
she
liked
best
and
there
were
some
folks
who
thought
she
might
leave
half
to
me
and
half
to
sarah
for
she
had
chick
nor
child
of
her
own
but
aunt
was
of
a
having
nature
and
what
she
had
once
got
together
she
could
bear
to
see
scattered
even
if
it
was
only
what
she
had
got
in
her
she
would
give
it
to
one
person
to
make
a
big
quilt
of
rather
than
give
it
to
two
persons
to
make
two
little
quilts
so
sarah
and
me
we
knew
that
the
money
might
come
to
either
or
neither
of
us
but
go
to
both
it
would
now
some
people
do
believe
in
special
mercies
but
i
have
always
thought
there
must
have
been
something
out
of
the
common
way
for
things
to
happen
as
they
did
the
day
aunt
maria
sprained
her
ankle
she
sent
over
to
the
farm
where
we
were
living
with
my
mother
who
was
a
sensible
woman
and
carried
on
the
farm
much
better
than
most
men
would
have
done
though
that
neither
here
nor
there
to
ask
if
sarah
or
me
could
be
spared
to
go
and
look
after
her
a
bit
for
the
doctor
said
she
could
put
her
foot
to
the
ground
for
a
week
or
more
now
the
minister
i
sit
under
always
warns
us
against
superstition
which
i
take
it
means
believing
more
than
you
have
any
occasion
to
and
i
not
more
given
to
it
than
most
folks
but
still
i
always
have
said
and
i
always
shall
say
that
there
a
special
providence
above
us
and
it
was
for
nothing
that
sarah
was
laid
up
with
a
quinsy
that
very
morning
so
i
put
a
few
things
together
in
i
remember
which
was
handier
to
carry
than
my
own
and
i
went
up
to
the
cottage
aunt
was
in
bed
and
whether
it
was
the
sprained
ankle
or
the
hot
weather
i
do
know
but
the
old
lady
was
cantankerous
past
all
believing
aunt
i
said
when
i
went
in
however
did
this
happen
you
come
have
you
she
said
without
answering
my
question
brought
enough
luggage
to
last
you
a
year
i
be
bound
when
i
was
young
a
girl
could
go
to
spend
a
week
without
nonsense
of
boxes
or
the
like
a
clean
shift
and
a
change
of
stockings
done
up
in
a
cotton
handkerchief
that
was
good
enough
for
us
but
now
you
girls
must
all
be
young
ladies
i
no
patience
with
you
i
did
answer
back
for
answering
back
is
a
poor
sort
of
business
when
the
other
person
is
able
to
make
you
pay
for
every
idle
word
of
course
it
different
if
you
have
anything
to
lose
by
it
so
i
just
said
mind
aunt
dear
i
really
have
brought
much
and
what
would
you
like
me
to
do
first
should
think
you
see
for
yourself
says
she
thumping
her
pillows
there
not
a
stick
in
the
house
been
dusted
yet
no
nor
a
stair
swep
so
i
set
to
to
clean
the
house
which
was
cleaner
than
most
already
and
i
got
a
nice
bit
of
dinner
and
took
it
up
on
a
tray
but
no
that
was
right
for
i
put
the
best
instead
of
the
cloth
on
the
tray
workhouse
is
where
you
end
says
aunt
but
she
ate
up
all
the
dinner
and
after
that
she
seemed
to
get
a
little
easier
in
her
temper
and
fell
off
to
sleep
i
finished
the
stairs
and
tidied
up
the
kitchen
and
then
i
went
to
dust
the
parlour
now
my
aunt
parlour
was
a
perfect
moral
i
have
never
seen
its
like
before
or
since
the
mantelpiece
and
the
corner
cupboard
and
the
shelves
behind
the
door
and
the
top
of
the
chest
of
drawers
and
the
bureau
were
all
covered
up
with
a
perfect
litter
and
lurry
of
old
china
not
sets
of
anything
but
different
basins
and
jugs
and
cups
and
plates
and
china
spoons
and
the
bust
of
john
wesley
and
elijah
feeding
the
ravens
in
a
red
gown
and
standing
on
a
green
crockery
grass
plot
there
was
every
kind
of
china
uselessness
that
you
could
think
of
and
sarah
and
i
used
to
think
it
hard
that
a
girl
had
no
chance
of
getting
on
in
life
without
she
dusted
all
this
rubbish
once
a
week
at
the
least
the
sooner
begun
the
sooner
ended
says
i
to
myself
so
i
took
the
silk
handkerchief
that
aunt
kep
a
purpose
an
old
one
it
was
that
had
belonged
to
uncle
and
hemmed
with
aunt
own
hair
and
marked
with
his
name
in
the
corner
folks
must
have
had
a
deal
of
time
in
those
days
i
often
think
and
i
began
to
dust
the
things
beginning
with
the
big
bowl
on
the
chest
of
drawers
for
aunt
always
would
have
everything
done
just
one
way
and
no
other
you
think
perhaps
that
i
might
as
well
have
sat
down
in
the
and
had
a
quiet
nap
and
told
aunt
afterwards
that
i
had
dusted
everything
but
you
must
know
she
was
quite
equivalent
to
asking
any
of
the
neighbours
who
might
drop
in
whether
that
dratted
china
of
hers
was
dusted
properly
it
was
a
hot
afternoon
and
i
was
tired
and
a
bit
cross
and
uncles
and
grandmothers
thinks
i
to
myself
what
a
stupid
old
lot
they
must
have
been
to
have
set
such
store
by
all
this
gimcrackery
oh
if
only
a
bull
or
something
could
get
in
here
for
five
minutes
and
smash
every
precious
oh
my
cats
alive
i
do
know
how
i
did
it
but
just
as
i
was
saying
that
about
the
bull
the
big
bowl
slipped
from
my
hands
and
broke
in
three
pieces
on
the
floor
at
my
feet
and
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
aunt
thump
thump
thumping
with
the
heel
of
her
boot
on
the
floor
for
me
to
go
up
and
tell
her
what
i
had
broken
i
tell
you
i
wished
from
my
heart
at
that
moment
that
it
was
me
that
had
had
the
quinsy
instead
of
sarah
i
was
so
knocked
all
of
a
heap
that
i
could
move
and
the
boot
went
on
thump
thump
thumping
overhead
i
had
to
go
but
i
was
flustered
to
that
degree
that
as
i
went
up
the
stairs
i
could
for
the
life
of
me
think
what
i
should
say
aunt
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
she
shook
her
fist
at
me
when
i
went
in
with
it
she
said
the
truth
which
of
them
is
it
the
yallar
china
dish
or
the
big
teapot
or
the
wedgwood
tobaccojar
that
belonged
to
your
grandfather
and
then
all
in
a
minute
i
knew
what
to
say
the
words
seemed
to
be
put
into
my
mouth
like
they
were
into
the
prophets
of
old
aunt
i
said
give
me
quite
a
turn
battering
on
the
floor
that
way
what
do
you
want
what
is
it
have
you
broken
you
wicked
heartless
girl
out
with
it
quick
i
says
i
hope
you
wo
mind
much
aunt
but
i
have
had
a
misfortune
with
the
little
cracked
that
the
potatopie
was
baked
in
but
i
can
easy
get
you
another
down
at
wilkins
aunt
fell
back
on
her
pillows
with
a
sort
of
groan
them
as
be
she
said
and
then
she
sat
up
again
bolt
upright
all
in
a
minute
fetch
me
the
pieces
she
says
short
and
sharp
i
hope
it
is
boastful
to
say
that
i
do
think
many
girls
would
have
had
the
sense
to
bring
up
that
dish
in
their
apron
and
to
break
it
on
their
knee
as
they
came
up
the
stairs
and
take
it
in
and
show
it
to
her
say
another
word
about
it
says
my
aunt
as
kind
and
hearty
as
you
please
things
not
being
as
bad
as
she
expected
it
made
her
quite
willing
to
put
up
with
things
being
a
bit
worse
than
they
had
been
five
minutes
before
i
often
noticed
it
is
this
way
with
people
a
good
girl
jane
she
says
very
good
girl
and
i
sha
forget
it
my
dear
go
on
down
now
and
make
haste
with
your
washing
up
and
get
to
work
dusting
the
china
and
it
was
such
a
weight
off
my
mind
to
feel
that
she
did
know
that
i
felt
as
if
everything
was
all
right
until
i
got
downstairs
and
see
those
three
pieces
of
that
red
and
yellow
and
green
and
blue
basin
lying
on
the
carpet
as
i
had
left
them
my
heart
beat
fit
to
knock
me
down
but
i
kept
my
wits
about
me
and
i
stuck
it
together
with
white
of
egg
and
put
it
back
in
its
place
on
the
wool
mat
with
the
little
teapot
on
top
of
it
so
that
no
one
could
have
noticed
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
it
unless
they
took
the
thing
up
in
their
hands
the
next
three
days
i
waited
on
aunt
hand
and
foot
and
did
everything
she
asked
and
she
was
as
pleased
as
pleased
till
i
felt
that
sarah
had
a
chance
on
the
third
day
i
told
aunt
that
mother
would
want
me
it
being
saturday
and
she
was
quite
willing
for
the
widow
gladish
to
come
in
and
do
for
her
while
i
was
away
i
chose
a
saturday
because
that
and
sunday
were
the
only
days
the
china
was
dusted
i
went
home
as
quick
as
i
could
and
i
told
mother
all
about
it
do
you
for
any
sake
tell
sarah
a
word
about
it
or
quinsy
or
no
quinsy
she
be
up
at
aunt
before
we
know
where
we
are
to
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
i
took
all
the
money
out
of
my
that
i
had
saved
up
for
starting
housekeeping
with
in
case
aunt
should
leave
her
money
to
sarah
and
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
i
took
the
first
train
to
london
i
asked
the
porter
at
the
station
to
tell
me
the
way
to
the
best
in
london
and
he
told
me
there
was
one
in
queen
victoria
street
so
i
went
there
it
was
a
beautiful
place
with
velvet
sofas
for
people
to
sit
down
on
while
they
looked
at
the
china
and
glass
and
chose
which
pattern
they
would
have
and
there
were
thousands
of
basins
far
more
beautiful
than
aunt
but
not
one
like
hers
and
when
i
had
looked
over
some
fifty
of
them
the
gentleman
who
was
showing
them
to
me
said
you
could
give
me
some
idea
of
what
it
is
you
do
want
now
i
had
brought
one
of
the
pieces
of
the
bowl
up
with
me
the
piece
at
the
back
where
it
did
show
and
i
pulled
it
out
and
showed
it
to
him
want
one
like
this
i
said
said
he
did
you
say
so
at
first
we
do
keep
that
sort
of
thing
here
and
it
a
chance
if
you
get
it
at
all
you
might
in
wardour
street
or
at
aked
in
green
street
leicester
square
well
time
was
getting
on
and
i
did
a
thing
i
had
never
done
before
though
i
had
often
read
of
it
in
the
novelettes
i
waved
my
umbrella
and
i
got
into
a
hansom
cab
man
i
said
you
please
drive
to
aked
in
green
street
leicester
square
and
drive
careful
young
man
for
i
have
a
piece
of
china
in
my
hands
that
worth
a
fortune
to
me
so
he
grinned
and
i
got
in
and
the
cab
started
a
hansom
cab
is
better
than
any
carriage
you
ever
rode
in
with
soft
cushions
to
lean
against
and
little
to
look
at
yourself
in
and
somehow
you
do
hear
the
wheels
i
leaned
back
and
looked
at
myself
and
felt
like
a
duchess
for
i
had
my
new
hat
and
mantle
on
and
i
knew
i
looked
nice
by
the
way
the
young
men
on
the
tops
of
the
omnibuses
looked
at
me
and
smiled
it
was
a
lovely
drive
when
we
got
to
aked
which
looked
to
me
more
like
a
shop
than
anything
else
and
very
poor
after
the
beautiful
place
in
queen
victoria
street
i
got
out
and
went
in
an
old
gentleman
came
towards
me
and
asked
what
he
could
do
for
me
and
he
looked
surprised
as
though
he
was
used
to
see
such
smart
girls
in
his
pokey
old
shop
sir
i
said
want
a
bowl
like
this
if
you
have
got
such
a
thing
among
your
old
odds
and
ends
he
took
the
piece
of
china
and
looked
at
it
through
his
glasses
for
a
minute
then
he
gave
it
back
to
me
very
carefully
not
a
piece
of
this
ware
in
the
market
the
few
specimens
extant
are
in
private
collections
dear
i
said
ca
i
get
another
like
it
if
you
were
to
offer
me
a
hundred
pounds
down
said
the
old
man
i
could
help
it
i
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
began
to
cry
for
it
seemed
as
if
all
my
hopes
of
aunt
maria
money
were
fading
away
like
the
hues
of
early
dawn
in
the
hymn
come
said
he
the
matter
cheer
up
i
suppose
you
in
service
and
you
broken
this
bowl
is
that
it
but
never
mind
your
mistress
ca
do
anything
to
you
servants
be
made
to
replace
valuable
bowls
like
this
that
dried
my
eyes
pretty
quick
i
can
tell
you
in
service
i
said
my
grandfather
farming
his
own
land
before
you
were
picked
out
of
the
gutter
i
be
bound
god
forgive
me
that
i
should
say
such
a
thing
to
an
old
man
my
own
aunt
with
a
better
lot
of
and
trumpery
in
her
parlour
than
you
got
in
all
your
shop
with
that
he
laughed
and
i
flounced
out
of
the
shop
my
cheeks
flaming
and
my
heart
going
like
an
clock
i
was
so
flustered
i
did
notice
that
some
one
came
out
of
the
shop
after
me
and
i
had
walked
a
dozen
yards
down
the
street
before
i
saw
that
some
one
was
alongside
of
me
and
saying
something
to
me
it
was
another
old
gentleman
at
least
not
so
old
as
aked
and
i
remembered
now
having
seen
him
at
the
back
of
the
shop
he
was
taking
off
his
hat
as
polite
as
you
please
quite
overcome
he
said
no
wonder
come
and
have
a
little
dinner
with
me
quietly
somewhere
and
tell
me
all
about
it
do
want
any
dinner
i
said
want
to
go
and
drown
myself
for
it
all
over
and
i
nothing
more
to
look
for
my
brother
harry
will
have
the
farm
and
i
sha
get
a
penny
of
aunt
money
why
could
they
have
made
plenty
of
the
ugly
old
basins
while
they
were
about
it
and
have
some
dinner
the
old
gentleman
said
again
perhaps
i
can
help
you
i
have
a
basin
just
like
that
so
i
did
we
went
to
some
place
where
there
were
a
lot
of
little
tables
and
waiters
in
black
clothes
and
we
had
a
nice
dinner
and
i
did
feel
better
for
it
and
when
we
had
come
to
the
cheese
i
told
him
exactly
what
had
happened
and
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
and
he
thought
and
thought
and
presently
he
said
you
think
your
aunt
would
sell
any
of
her
china
i
downright
sure
she
would
i
said
it
no
good
your
asking
you
see
your
aunt
wo
be
down
for
three
or
four
days
yet
you
give
me
your
address
and
i
write
and
tell
you
if
i
think
of
anything
and
with
that
he
paid
the
bill
and
had
a
cab
called
and
put
me
in
it
and
paid
the
driver
and
i
went
along
home
i
did
sleep
much
that
night
and
next
day
i
was
thinking
all
of
whatever
i
could
do
for
it
was
in
nature
that
my
aunt
would
not
find
me
out
before
another
two
days
was
over
my
head
and
she
had
never
been
so
nice
and
kind
and
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
say
my
money
left
to
jane
will
be
bound
not
to
part
with
my
china
nor
my
old
chairs
and
presses
do
you
forget
my
child
it
all
written
in
black
and
white
and
if
the
person
my
left
to
sells
these
old
things
my
money
goes
along
too
there
was
no
letter
on
monday
morning
and
i
was
up
to
my
elbows
in
the
suds
doing
aunt
bit
of
washing
for
her
when
i
heard
a
step
on
the
brick
path
and
there
was
that
old
gentleman
coming
round
by
the
to
the
says
he
fresh
happened
any
sake
says
i
in
a
whisper
out
of
this
she
hear
if
i
say
more
than
two
words
to
you
if
you
thought
of
anything
that
to
be
of
any
use
get
along
to
the
church
porch
and
i
be
with
you
as
soon
as
i
can
get
these
things
through
the
and
out
on
the
line
he
says
in
a
whisper
let
me
into
the
parlour
for
five
minutes
to
have
a
look
round
and
see
what
the
rest
of
the
bowl
is
like
then
i
thought
of
all
the
stories
i
had
heard
of
pedlars
packs
and
a
married
lady
taken
unexpectedly
and
tricks
like
that
to
get
into
the
house
when
no
one
was
about
so
i
thought
if
you
are
to
go
in
i
must
go
in
with
you
and
i
squeezed
my
hands
out
of
the
suds
and
rolled
them
into
my
apron
and
went
in
and
him
after
me
you
never
see
a
man
go
on
as
he
did
it
my
belief
he
was
hours
in
that
room
going
round
and
round
like
a
squirrel
in
a
cage
picking
up
first
one
bit
of
trumpery
and
then
another
with
two
fingers
and
a
thumb
as
carefully
as
if
it
had
been
a
bonnet
just
home
from
the
draper
and
setting
everything
down
on
the
very
exact
spot
he
took
them
up
from
more
than
once
i
thought
that
i
had
entertained
a
loony
unawares
when
i
saw
him
turn
up
the
cups
and
plates
and
look
twice
as
long
at
the
bottoms
of
them
as
he
had
at
the
pretty
parts
that
were
meant
to
show
and
all
the
time
he
kept
saying
by
gad
perfectly
unique
or
as
i
a
sinner
and
when
he
came
to
the
large
blue
dish
that
stands
at
the
back
of
the
bureau
i
thought
he
would
have
gone
down
on
his
knees
to
it
and
worshipped
it
worcester
he
said
to
himself
in
a
whisper
speaking
very
slowly
as
if
the
words
were
pleasant
in
his
mouth
worcester
an
dish
i
had
as
much
trouble
getting
him
out
of
that
parlour
as
you
would
have
getting
a
cow
out
of
a
and
every
minute
i
was
afraid
aunt
would
hear
him
or
hear
the
china
rattle
or
something
but
he
never
rattled
a
bit
bless
you
but
was
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
and
as
for
carefulness
he
was
like
a
woman
with
her
first
baby
i
did
dare
ask
him
anything
for
fear
he
should
answer
too
loud
and
he
went
up
to
the
church
porch
and
waited
for
me
he
had
a
parcel
with
him
a
big
one
and
i
thought
to
myself
he
brought
his
bowl
and
is
wishful
to
sell
it
i
got
those
things
through
the
pretty
quick
i
can
tell
you
i
often
wish
i
could
get
a
maid
who
would
work
as
fast
as
i
used
to
when
i
was
a
girl
then
i
ran
up
and
asked
aunt
if
she
could
spare
me
to
run
down
to
the
shop
for
some
sago
and
i
put
on
my
sunbonnet
and
ran
up
just
as
i
was
to
the
church
porch
the
old
gentleman
was
skipping
with
impatience
i
heard
of
people
skipping
with
impatience
but
i
never
saw
any
one
do
it
before
look
here
he
said
want
you
i
must
oh
i
do
know
which
way
to
begin
i
have
so
many
things
to
say
i
want
to
see
your
aunt
and
ask
her
to
let
me
buy
her
china
may
save
your
trouble
i
said
she
never
do
it
left
her
china
to
me
in
her
will
i
said
not
that
i
was
quite
sure
of
it
but
still
i
was
sure
enough
to
say
so
the
old
gentleman
put
down
his
parcel
on
the
porch
seat
as
careful
as
if
it
had
been
a
sick
child
and
said
your
aunt
wo
leave
you
anything
if
she
knows
you
have
broken
the
bowl
will
she
i
said
wo
that
true
and
you
can
tell
her
if
you
like
for
i
knew
very
well
he
would
says
he
speaking
very
slowly
i
lent
you
my
bowl
you
could
pretend
it
hers
and
she
never
know
the
difference
for
they
are
as
like
as
two
peas
i
can
tell
the
difference
of
course
but
then
i
a
collector
if
i
lend
you
the
bowl
will
you
promise
and
vow
in
writing
and
sign
it
with
your
name
to
sell
all
that
china
to
me
directly
it
comes
into
your
possession
good
gracious
girl
it
will
be
hundreds
of
pounds
in
your
pocket
that
was
a
sad
moment
for
me
i
might
have
taken
the
bowl
and
promised
and
vowed
and
then
when
the
china
came
to
me
i
might
have
told
him
i
had
the
power
to
sell
it
but
that
would
have
looked
well
if
any
one
had
come
to
know
of
it
so
i
just
said
straight
out
only
condition
of
my
having
my
aunt
money
is
that
i
never
part
with
the
china
he
was
silent
a
minute
looking
out
of
the
porch
at
the
green
trees
waving
about
in
the
sunshine
over
the
gravestones
and
then
he
says
here
you
seem
an
honourable
girl
i
am
a
collector
i
buy
china
and
keep
it
in
cases
and
look
at
it
and
it
more
to
me
than
meat
or
drink
or
wife
or
child
or
fire
do
you
understand
and
i
can
no
more
bear
to
think
of
that
china
being
lost
to
the
world
in
a
cottage
instead
of
being
in
my
collection
than
you
can
bear
to
think
of
your
aunt
finding
out
about
the
bowl
and
leaving
the
money
to
your
cousin
sarah
of
course
i
knew
by
that
that
he
had
been
gossiping
in
the
village
i
said
for
i
saw
that
he
had
something
more
on
his
mind
an
old
man
he
went
on
that
need
not
stand
in
the
way
rather
the
contrary
for
i
shall
be
less
trouble
to
you
than
a
young
husband
will
you
marry
me
out
of
hand
and
then
when
your
aunt
dies
the
china
will
be
mine
and
you
will
be
well
provided
for
no
one
but
a
madman
would
have
made
such
an
offer
but
that
was
a
reason
for
me
to
refuse
it
i
pretended
to
think
a
bit
but
my
mind
was
made
up
the
bowl
i
said
course
i
lend
you
my
bowl
and
you
shall
give
me
the
pieces
of
the
old
one
lord
worsley
specimen
has
rivets
in
it
sir
i
said
seems
to
be
a
way
out
of
it
that
might
suit
both
of
us
so
if
you
speak
to
mother
and
if
your
circumstances
is
as
you
represent
i
accept
your
offer
and
i
be
your
good
lady
and
then
i
went
back
to
aunt
and
told
her
wilkinses
was
out
of
sago
but
they
would
have
some
in
on
wednesday
it
was
all
right
about
the
bowl
she
never
noticed
the
difference
i
was
married
to
the
old
gentleman
whose
name
was
fytche
the
next
week
by
special
licence
at
nicholas
cole
abbey
queen
victoria
street
which
is
very
near
that
beautiful
glass
and
china
shop
where
i
had
tried
to
match
the
bowl
and
my
aunt
died
three
months
later
and
left
me
everything
sarah
married
in
quite
a
poor
way
that
quinsy
of
hers
cost
her
dear
fytche
was
very
well
off
and
i
should
have
liked
living
at
his
house
well
enough
if
it
had
been
for
the
china
the
house
was
cram
full
of
it
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
no
more
going
out
to
dinner
no
amusements
nothing
as
a
girl
like
me
had
a
right
to
look
for
so
one
day
i
told
him
straight
out
i
thought
he
had
better
give
up
collecting
and
sell
aunt
things
and
we
would
buy
a
nice
little
place
in
the
country
with
the
money
my
dear
he
said
ca
sell
your
aunt
china
she
left
it
stated
expressly
in
her
will
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
chuckled
for
he
thought
he
had
got
me
there
but
you
can
i
said
china
is
yours
now
i
know
enough
about
law
to
know
that
and
you
can
sell
it
and
you
shall
and
so
he
did
whether
it
was
law
or
not
for
you
can
make
a
man
do
anything
if
you
only
give
your
mind
to
it
and
take
your
time
and
keep
all
on
it
was
called
the
great
fytche
sale
and
i
made
him
pay
the
money
he
got
for
it
into
the
bank
and
when
he
died
i
bought
a
snug
little
farm
with
it
and
married
a
young
man
that
i
had
had
in
my
eye
long
before
i
had
heard
of
fytche
and
we
are
very
comfortably
off
and
not
a
bit
of
china
in
the
house
that
more
than
twenty
years
old
so
that
whatever
broke
can
be
easy
replaced
as
for
his
collection
which
would
have
brought
me
in
thousands
of
pounds
they
say
i
have
to
own
he
had
the
better
of
me
there
for
he
left
it
by
will
to
the
south
kensington
museum
barring
the
way
i
do
know
how
she
could
have
done
it
i
could
have
done
it
myself
at
least
i
do
think
so
but
being
lame
and
small
and
not
noticeable
anyhow
i
had
never
any
temptation
so
i
ca
judge
those
that
have
ellen
was
tall
and
a
slight
figure
and
as
pretty
as
a
picture
in
her
sunday
clothes
and
prettier
than
any
picture
on
a
working
day
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
to
her
shoulder
and
the
colour
in
her
face
like
a
rose
and
her
brown
hair
all
twisted
up
rough
anyhow
and
of
course
she
was
much
sought
after
and
flattered
but
i
could
have
done
it
myself
i
think
even
if
i
had
been
sought
after
twice
as
much
and
twice
as
handsome
no
i
could
not
after
the
doctor
had
said
that
father
heart
was
weak
and
any
sudden
shock
might
bring
an
end
to
him
but
oh
poor
dear
she
was
my
sister
my
own
only
sister
and
not
the
time
now
to
be
hard
on
her
and
she
where
she
is
she
was
walking
regular
with
a
steady
young
man
who
worked
through
the
week
at
hastings
and
come
home
here
on
a
sunday
and
she
would
have
married
him
and
been
as
happy
as
a
queen
i
know
and
all
her
looking
in
the
glass
and
dressing
herself
pretty
would
have
come
to
being
proud
of
her
babies
and
spending
what
bits
she
could
get
together
in
making
them
look
smart
but
it
was
not
to
be
young
barber
the
grocer
son
who
had
a
situation
in
london
he
come
down
for
his
summer
holiday
and
then
it
was
thank
you
kindly
to
poor
arthur
simmons
that
had
loved
her
faithful
and
true
them
two
years
and
she
was
all
for
walking
with
young
barber
besides
running
into
the
shop
twenty
times
a
day
when
no
occasion
was
just
for
a
word
across
the
counter
and
father
was
the
best
pleased
but
he
was
always
a
silent
man
very
pious
and
not
saying
much
as
he
sat
at
his
bench
for
he
had
been
brought
up
to
the
shoemaking
and
was
very
respected
among
pevensey
folks
he
would
hum
a
hymn
or
two
at
his
work
sometimes
but
he
was
never
a
man
of
words
when
young
barber
went
back
to
london
ellen
she
began
to
lose
her
pretty
looks
i
had
never
thought
much
of
young
barber
there
was
something
common
about
him
not
like
the
labouring
men
but
a
kind
of
town
commonness
which
is
twenty
times
worse
to
my
thinking
and
if
i
did
like
him
before
you
may
guess
i
did
waste
much
love
on
him
when
i
see
poor
ellen
looks
now
if
i
am
to
tell
you
this
story
at
all
i
must
tell
it
very
steady
and
quiet
and
not
run
on
about
what
i
thought
or
what
i
felt
or
i
sha
never
have
the
heart
to
go
through
it
the
long
and
short
of
it
was
that
a
month
had
passed
over
our
heads
after
young
barber
leaving
when
one
morning
our
ellen
was
there
and
she
left
a
note
nailed
to
father
bench
to
say
she
had
gone
off
with
her
true
love
and
father
was
to
mind
for
she
was
going
to
be
married
father
he
did
say
a
word
but
he
turned
a
dreadful
white
and
blue
his
lips
were
and
for
one
dreadful
moment
i
thought
that
i
had
lost
him
too
but
he
come
round
presently
i
ran
across
to
the
three
swans
to
get
a
drop
of
brandy
for
him
and
i
looked
at
her
letter
again
and
i
looked
at
him
and
we
both
see
that
neither
of
us
believed
that
she
was
going
to
be
married
there
was
something
about
the
very
way
of
the
words
as
she
had
written
them
which
showed
they
were
true
father
he
said
nothing
only
when
next
sunday
had
come
and
i
had
laid
out
his
sunday
things
and
his
hat
all
brushed
as
usual
he
says
away
my
girl
i
do
believe
in
sunday
how
can
i
believe
in
all
that
and
my
ellen
gone
to
shame
and
after
that
sundays
was
the
same
to
him
as
weekdays
and
the
folks
looked
shy
at
us
and
i
think
they
thought
that
what
with
ellen
running
away
and
father
working
on
sundays
we
was
on
the
to
the
pit
of
destruction
and
so
the
time
went
on
and
it
was
christmas
the
bells
was
ringing
for
christmas
eve
and
i
says
to
father
father
come
to
church
happen
it
all
true
and
ellen
an
honest
woman
after
all
and
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
me
and
at
that
moment
there
come
a
soft
little
knock
at
the
door
i
knew
who
it
was
afore
i
had
time
to
stir
a
foot
to
go
across
the
kitchen
and
open
the
door
to
her
she
blinked
her
eyes
at
the
light
as
i
opened
the
door
to
her
oh
pale
and
thin
her
face
was
that
used
to
be
so
and
i
come
in
she
said
as
if
it
was
her
own
home
and
father
he
looked
at
her
like
a
man
that
sees
nothing
and
i
was
frightened
what
he
might
do
like
the
fool
i
was
that
ought
to
have
known
better
very
tired
says
ellen
leaning
against
the
have
come
from
a
very
long
way
and
the
next
minute
father
makes
two
long
steps
to
the
door
and
his
arms
is
round
her
and
she
on
his
neck
and
they
two
holding
each
other
as
if
they
would
never
let
go
and
so
she
come
home
and
i
shut
the
door
and
in
all
that
time
father
and
me
we
could
make
too
much
of
her
me
being
that
thankful
to
the
lord
that
he
had
let
our
dear
come
back
to
us
and
never
a
word
did
she
say
to
me
of
him
that
had
been
her
ruin
but
one
night
when
i
asked
her
and
hardly
thinking
what
i
was
doing
some
question
about
him
father
down
with
his
fist
on
the
table
and
says
he
you
name
that
name
my
girl
you
light
hell
in
me
and
if
ever
i
see
his
damned
face
again
god
help
him
and
me
too
and
so
i
held
my
stupid
tongue
and
sat
sewing
with
ellen
long
days
and
it
was
a
happy
sad
time
if
a
time
can
be
sad
and
happy
both
and
it
was
about
that
her
time
come
and
we
had
kept
it
quiet
and
nobody
knew
but
us
and
jarvis
that
lived
in
the
cottage
next
to
ours
and
was
ellen
godmother
and
loved
her
like
her
own
daughter
and
when
the
baby
come
ellen
says
it
a
boy
or
a
girl
and
we
told
her
it
was
a
boy
then
says
she
god
for
that
my
baby
wo
live
to
know
such
shame
as
mine
and
there
was
one
of
us
dared
tell
her
that
god
meant
no
shame
or
pain
or
grief
at
all
should
come
to
her
little
baby
because
it
was
dead
but
she
would
have
it
to
lie
by
her
and
we
said
no
it
was
asleep
and
for
all
we
said
she
guessed
the
truth
somehow
and
she
began
to
cry
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
and
wetting
the
linen
about
her
and
she
began
to
moan
want
my
baby
oh
bring
me
my
little
baby
that
i
have
never
seen
yet
i
want
to
say
to
it
for
i
shall
never
go
where
it
is
going
and
father
said
her
the
child
i
had
dressed
the
poor
little
thing
a
pretty
boy
and
would
have
been
a
fine
man
in
one
of
the
gowns
i
had
taken
a
pleasure
in
sewing
for
it
to
wear
and
the
little
cap
with
the
crimped
border
that
had
been
ellen
own
when
she
was
a
baby
and
her
pride
and
i
brought
it
and
put
it
in
her
arms
and
it
was
in
my
hands
as
i
carried
it
and
she
laid
its
head
on
her
breast
as
well
as
she
could
for
her
weakness
and
father
who
was
leaning
over
her
nigh
mad
with
love
and
being
so
anxious
about
her
he
says
lucy
take
the
poor
little
thing
away
ellen
he
says
you
must
try
to
get
well
and
strong
for
the
sake
of
those
that
love
you
then
she
says
turning
her
eyes
on
him
shining
like
stars
out
of
her
pale
face
and
still
holding
her
baby
tight
to
her
breast
know
what
the
best
thing
i
can
do
for
them
as
love
me
and
doing
it
fast
kiss
me
father
and
kiss
the
baby
too
perhaps
if
i
hold
it
tight
we
go
out
into
the
dark
together
and
god
have
the
heart
to
part
us
and
so
she
died
and
there
was
no
one
but
me
that
touched
her
after
she
died
for
all
i
am
a
cripple
and
i
laid
her
out
my
pretty
with
my
own
hands
and
the
baby
in
the
hollow
of
her
arm
and
i
put
primroses
all
round
them
and
i
took
father
to
look
at
them
when
all
was
done
and
we
stood
there
holding
hands
and
looking
at
her
lying
there
so
sweet
and
peaceful
and
looking
so
good
too
whatever
you
may
think
with
all
the
trouble
wiped
off
her
face
as
if
the
lord
had
washed
it
already
in
his
heavenly
light
now
ellen
was
buried
in
the
churchyard
and
parson
who
was
always
a
hard
man
he
would
have
her
laid
away
to
the
north
side
where
no
sun
gets
to
for
the
trees
and
the
church
and
where
few
folks
like
to
be
buried
but
father
he
said
lay
her
beside
her
mother
in
the
bit
of
ground
i
bought
twenty
years
ago
where
i
mean
to
lie
myself
and
lucy
too
when
her
time
comes
so
that
if
the
talk
of
rising
again
is
true
we
shall
be
all
together
at
the
last
as
kinsfolk
should
so
they
laid
her
there
and
her
name
was
cut
under
mother
on
the
headstone
father
did
grieve
and
take
on
as
some
men
do
but
he
was
quieter
than
he
used
to
be
and
did
seem
to
have
that
heart
in
his
work
that
he
always
had
even
after
she
had
left
us
it
seemed
as
if
the
spring
of
him
was
broken
somehow
not
but
what
he
was
goodness
itself
to
me
then
and
always
but
i
was
his
favourite
child
nor
could
i
have
looked
to
be
me
being
what
i
am
and
she
so
sweet
and
pretty
and
such
a
way
with
her
and
father
went
to
church
to
the
burying
but
he
would
go
to
service
think
maybe
there
a
god
and
if
there
is
i
have
that
in
my
heart
that
quite
enough
keeping
in
my
own
poor
house
without
my
daring
to
take
it
into
his
and
so
i
gave
up
going
too
i
would
seem
to
be
judging
father
not
though
i
might
be
judged
myself
by
all
the
village
but
when
i
heard
the
ringing
ringing
it
was
like
as
if
some
one
that
loved
me
was
calling
to
me
and
me
not
answering
and
sometimes
when
all
the
folk
was
in
church
i
used
to
hobble
up
on
my
crutches
to
the
gate
and
stand
there
and
sometimes
hear
a
bit
of
the
singing
come
through
the
open
door
it
was
the
end
of
august
that
barber
at
the
shop
fell
off
a
ladder
leading
to
his
wareroom
and
was
killed
on
the
spot
and
jarvis
she
says
to
me
that
young
barber
comes
home
as
i
suppose
he
will
to
take
what
his
by
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
he
might
as
well
go
and
put
his
head
into
an
oven
on
a
and
get
his
worst
friend
to
shove
his
legs
in
after
him
and
shut
the
door
to
wo
come
back
says
i
could
he
face
it
when
every
one
in
the
village
knows
it
for
when
ellen
died
it
could
not
be
kept
secret
any
longer
and
a
heap
of
folks
that
would
have
drawn
their
skirts
aside
rather
than
brush
against
her
if
she
had
been
there
alive
and
well
with
her
baby
at
her
breast
had
a
tear
and
a
kind
word
for
her
now
that
she
was
gone
where
no
tears
and
no
words
could
get
at
her
for
good
or
evil
i
see
once
a
bit
of
poetry
in
a
book
and
it
said
when
a
woman
had
done
what
she
had
done
the
only
way
to
get
forgiven
is
to
die
and
i
believe
that
true
but
it
is
true
of
fathers
and
sisters
it
was
sunday
morning
and
father
he
was
working
away
at
his
bench
not
that
it
ever
seemed
to
make
him
any
happier
to
work
only
he
was
more
miserable
if
he
did
and
i
had
crept
up
to
the
churchyard
to
lean
against
the
wall
and
listen
to
the
psalms
being
sung
inside
when
looking
down
the
village
street
i
saw
shop
open
and
out
came
young
barber
himself
oh
if
god
forgets
any
one
in
his
mercy
it
will
be
him
and
his
like
he
come
out
all
smart
and
neat
in
his
new
black
and
he
was
whistling
a
hymn
tune
softly
our
house
was
betwixt
barber
shop
and
the
church
not
a
off
anyway
and
i
prayed
to
god
that
barber
would
turn
the
other
way
and
not
come
by
our
house
where
father
he
was
sitting
at
his
bench
with
the
door
open
but
he
did
turn
and
come
walking
towards
me
and
i
had
laid
my
crutches
on
the
ground
and
i
stooped
to
pick
them
up
to
go
home
to
stop
words
for
what
were
words
and
she
in
her
grave
when
i
heard
young
barber
voice
and
i
looked
over
the
wall
and
see
he
had
stopped
in
his
madness
and
folly
and
the
wickedness
of
his
heart
right
opposite
the
house
he
had
brought
shame
to
and
he
was
speaking
to
father
through
the
door
i
could
hear
what
he
said
but
he
seemed
to
expect
an
answer
and
when
none
came
he
called
out
a
little
louder
well
you
no
call
to
hold
your
head
so
high
anyhow
and
for
the
way
he
said
it
i
could
have
killed
him
myself
but
for
having
been
brought
up
to
know
that
two
wrongs
do
make
a
right
and
is
mine
saith
the
lord
i
will
repay
they
was
at
prayers
in
the
church
and
there
was
no
sound
in
the
street
but
the
cooing
of
the
pigeons
on
the
roofs
and
young
barber
he
stood
there
looking
in
at
our
door
with
that
little
sneering
smile
on
his
face
and
the
next
minute
he
was
running
for
his
life
for
the
church
where
all
the
folks
were
and
father
after
him
like
a
madman
with
his
long
knife
in
his
hand
that
he
used
to
cut
the
leather
with
it
all
happened
in
a
flash
barber
come
running
up
the
dusty
road
in
his
black
and
passed
me
as
i
stood
by
the
churchyard
gate
and
up
towards
the
church
but
sudden
in
the
path
he
stopped
short
his
eyes
seeming
starting
out
of
his
head
as
he
looked
at
ellen
grave
not
that
he
could
see
her
name
the
headstone
being
turned
the
other
way
and
he
put
his
hands
before
his
eyes
and
stood
still
like
a
rabbit
when
the
dogs
are
on
it
and
it
ca
find
no
way
out
then
he
cried
out
no
cover
her
face
for
god
sake
and
crouched
down
against
the
footstone
and
father
coming
swift
behind
him
passed
me
at
the
gate
and
he
ran
his
knife
through
barber
back
twice
as
he
crouched
and
they
rolled
on
the
path
together
then
all
the
folks
in
church
that
had
heard
the
scream
they
come
out
like
ants
when
you
walk
through
an
young
barber
was
holding
on
to
the
headstone
the
blood
running
out
through
his
new
broadcloth
and
death
written
on
his
face
in
big
letters
i
ran
to
lift
up
father
who
had
fallen
with
his
face
on
the
grave
and
as
i
stooped
over
him
young
barber
he
turned
his
head
towards
me
and
he
says
in
a
voice
i
could
hardly
catch
such
a
whisper
it
was
there
a
child
i
did
know
there
was
a
child
a
little
child
in
her
arm
and
flowers
all
round
child
says
i
may
god
forgive
you
and
i
knew
that
he
had
seen
her
as
i
see
her
when
my
hands
had
dressed
her
for
her
sleep
through
the
long
night
i
never
have
believed
in
ghosts
but
there
is
no
knowing
what
the
good
lord
will
allow
so
vengeance
overtook
him
and
they
carried
him
away
to
die
with
the
blood
dropping
on
the
gravel
and
he
never
spoke
a
word
again
and
when
they
lifted
father
up
with
the
red
knife
still
fast
in
his
hand
they
found
that
he
was
dead
and
his
face
was
white
and
his
lips
were
blue
like
as
i
had
seen
them
before
and
they
all
said
father
must
have
been
mad
and
so
he
lies
where
he
wished
to
lie
and
there
a
place
there
where
i
shall
lie
some
day
where
father
lies
and
mother
and
my
dear
with
her
little
baby
in
the
hollow
of
her
arm
grandsire
triples
i
was
promised
to
william
in
a
manner
of
speaking
close
upon
seven
year
what
i
mean
to
say
is
when
he
was
nigh
upon
fourteen
and
was
to
go
away
to
his
uncle
in
somerset
to
learn
farming
he
gave
me
a
kiss
and
half
of
a
broken
sixpence
and
said
i
shall
never
think
of
any
girl
but
you
and
you
must
never
think
of
any
chap
but
me
and
the
lord
in
his
goodness
knows
that
i
never
did
father
and
mother
laughed
a
bit
and
called
it
child
nonsense
but
they
was
willing
enough
for
all
that
for
william
was
a
likely
chap
and
would
be
when
his
good
father
died
which
i
am
sure
i
never
wished
nor
prayed
for
all
the
trouble
come
from
his
going
to
somerset
to
learn
farming
for
his
uncle
that
was
there
was
a
roman
and
he
taught
william
a
good
deal
more
than
he
set
out
to
learn
so
that
presently
nothing
would
do
but
william
must
turn
roman
catholic
himself
i
did
mind
bless
you
i
never
could
see
what
there
was
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
betwixt
the
two
lots
of
them
lord
love
us
we
all
christians
i
should
hope
but
father
and
mother
was
dreadful
put
out
when
the
letter
come
saying
william
had
been
like
as
if
he
was
a
parcel
come
by
carrier
father
he
says
kate
least
said
soonest
mended
but
i
had
rather
see
you
laid
out
on
the
best
bed
upstairs
than
i
see
you
married
to
william
a
son
of
the
scarlet
woman
in
my
silly
innocence
i
could
think
what
he
meant
for
mother
was
a
decent
body
who
wore
a
lilac
print
on
and
a
plain
black
gown
on
sunday
for
all
she
was
a
wife
and
might
have
gone
smart
as
a
cock
pheasant
it
was
at
and
i
was
on
to
my
and
mother
sniffing
a
little
for
company
behind
the
and
father
he
bangs
down
his
fist
in
a
way
to
make
the
cups
rattle
again
and
he
says
got
to
give
him
up
my
girl
you
write
and
tell
him
so
and
i
take
the
letter
as
i
go
down
to
the
church
to
practice
i
been
a
good
father
to
you
and
you
must
be
a
good
girl
to
me
and
if
you
was
to
marry
him
him
being
what
he
is
never
speak
to
you
again
in
this
world
or
the
next
would
have
any
chance
in
the
next
i
afraid
james
said
my
mother
gently
her
poor
soul
it
could
hope
to
go
to
the
blessed
place
after
that
should
hope
not
said
my
father
and
with
that
he
got
up
and
went
out
half
his
tea
not
drunk
left
in
the
mug
well
i
wrote
that
letter
and
i
told
william
right
enough
that
him
and
me
could
never
be
anything
but
friends
and
that
he
must
think
of
me
as
a
sister
and
that
was
what
father
told
me
to
say
but
i
hope
it
was
very
wrong
of
me
to
put
in
a
little
bit
of
my
own
and
this
is
what
i
said
after
i
had
told
him
about
the
friend
and
sister
dear
william
says
i
shall
never
love
anybody
but
you
that
you
may
rely
and
i
will
live
an
old
maid
to
the
end
of
my
days
rather
than
take
up
with
any
other
chap
and
i
should
like
to
see
you
once
if
convenient
before
we
part
for
ever
to
tell
you
all
this
and
to
say
and
god
bless
you
so
you
must
find
out
a
way
to
let
me
know
quiet
when
you
come
home
from
learning
the
farming
in
somerset
and
may
i
be
forgiven
the
deceitfulness
and
what
i
may
call
the
impudence
of
it
i
really
did
give
father
that
same
letter
to
post
and
him
believing
me
to
be
a
better
girl
than
i
was
to
my
shame
posted
it
not
doubting
that
i
had
only
wrote
what
he
told
me
that
was
the
saddest
summer
ever
i
had
the
roses
was
nothing
to
me
nor
the
lavender
neither
that
i
had
always
been
so
fond
of
and
as
for
the
raspberries
i
do
believe
i
should
have
cared
if
there
had
been
one
on
the
canes
and
even
the
little
chickens
i
thought
them
a
bother
and
it
goes
to
my
heart
to
say
it
a
whole
sitting
was
eaten
by
the
rats
in
consequence
everything
seemed
to
go
wrong
the
butter
was
twice
as
long
as
ever
i
knowed
it
and
the
broad
beans
got
black
fly
and
father
lost
half
his
hay
with
the
weather
if
it
had
been
me
that
had
done
something
unkind
father
would
have
said
it
was
a
providence
on
me
but
of
course
i
knew
better
than
to
speak
up
to
my
own
father
with
his
hay
lying
rotting
and
smoking
in
the
and
telling
him
he
was
judged
well
the
harvest
was
got
in
it
was
neither
here
nor
there
i
have
seen
better
years
and
i
have
seen
worse
and
october
come
i
was
getting
to
bed
one
night
at
least
i
had
begun
to
undress
for
i
was
sitting
there
with
william
letters
as
he
had
wrote
me
from
time
to
time
while
he
was
in
somerset
and
i
was
reading
them
over
and
thinking
of
william
silly
fashion
as
a
young
girl
will
and
wishing
it
had
been
me
was
a
roman
catholic
and
him
a
protestant
because
then
i
could
have
gone
into
a
convent
like
the
wicked
people
in
father
i
was
in
that
state
of
silliness
you
see
that
i
would
have
liked
to
do
something
for
william
even
if
it
was
only
going
into
a
convent
to
be
bricked
up
alive
perhaps
and
then
i
hears
a
scratch
scratch
scratching
and
the
mice
says
i
but
i
did
take
any
notice
and
then
there
was
a
little
tap
tapping
like
a
bird
would
make
with
its
beak
on
the
and
i
went
and
opened
it
thinking
it
was
a
bird
that
had
lost
its
way
and
was
coming
as
they
will
to
the
light
so
i
drew
the
curtain
and
opened
the
window
and
it
was
william
go
away
do
says
i
will
hear
you
he
had
climbed
up
by
the
that
grew
right
and
left
up
the
wall
and
ask
your
pardon
says
he
pretty
sweetheart
for
making
so
free
as
to
come
to
your
window
this
time
of
night
but
there
seem
any
other
way
go
dear
william
do
go
says
i
expected
every
moment
to
see
the
door
open
and
father
put
his
head
in
not
going
said
william
you
tell
me
where
you
meet
me
to
say
and
god
bless
you
like
you
said
in
the
letter
though
i
knew
the
whole
parish
better
than
i
know
the
palm
of
my
hand
if
you
believe
me
i
could
for
the
life
of
me
for
the
moment
think
of
any
place
where
i
could
meet
william
and
i
stood
like
a
fool
trembling
oh
what
a
jump
i
gave
when
i
heard
a
noise
like
a
heavy
foot
in
the
garden
outside
it
father
got
round
oh
he
kill
you
william
oh
whatever
shall
we
do
said
william
and
he
caught
hold
of
my
shoulder
and
gave
me
a
gentle
little
shake
was
only
one
of
these
pears
as
i
kicked
off
they
must
be
as
hard
as
iron
to
fall
like
that
then
he
gave
me
a
kiss
and
i
said
i
meet
you
by
the
parson
shave
at
five
and
do
go
my
so
i
can
hardly
hear
myself
speak
little
bird
says
william
then
he
kissed
me
again
and
off
he
went
and
considering
how
quiet
he
came
so
that
even
i
hear
him
you
would
not
believe
the
noise
he
made
getting
down
that
i
thought
every
minute
some
one
would
be
coming
in
to
see
what
was
happening
well
the
next
day
i
went
about
my
work
as
frightened
as
a
rabbit
and
my
heart
beating
fit
to
choke
me
trying
not
to
think
of
what
i
had
promised
to
do
at
father
says
looking
straight
before
him
birt
has
come
home
kate
you
remember
i
got
your
promise
not
to
pass
no
words
with
him
him
being
where
he
is
without
the
fold
among
the
dogs
and
things
and
i
did
answer
back
though
i
knew
well
enough
it
honest
but
he
had
got
my
word
father
had
brought
me
up
careful
and
kind
and
i
knew
my
duty
to
my
parents
and
i
meant
to
do
it
too
but
i
could
help
thinking
i
owed
a
little
bit
of
a
duty
to
william
and
i
meant
doing
that
so
far
as
keeping
my
promise
to
meet
him
that
afternoon
went
so
after
tea
i
says
and
i
do
think
it
is
almost
the
only
lie
i
ever
told
i
says
got
the
jumping
toothache
and
it
that
bad
i
can
hardly
see
to
thread
my
needle
then
she
says
as
i
knew
she
would
her
being
as
kind
an
old
soul
as
ever
trod
and
lie
down
a
bit
and
put
the
old
sheepskin
coat
over
your
head
and
i
get
on
with
the
darning
so
i
went
upstairs
trembling
all
over
i
took
the
bolster
and
pillow
and
put
them
under
the
covers
to
look
as
like
me
as
i
could
and
i
put
the
old
sheepskin
coat
at
the
top
of
all
and
as
you
come
into
the
room
any
one
would
have
thought
it
was
me
lying
there
with
the
toothache
then
i
took
my
hat
and
shawl
and
i
went
out
quiet
as
a
mouse
through
the
dairy
when
i
got
to
the
parson
shave
there
was
william
and
i
was
so
glad
to
see
him
i
did
think
of
nothing
else
for
full
half
a
minute
then
william
said
only
one
field
to
the
church
why
not
go
up
there
and
sit
in
the
porch
see
it
coming
on
to
rain
so
he
took
my
arm
and
we
started
across
the
field
where
all
the
days
of
the
year
but
one
you
would
not
meet
a
soul
we
went
up
through
the
churchyard
it
was
dark
but
i
was
a
bit
afraid
with
william
arm
round
me
but
when
we
got
to
the
porch
and
had
sat
down
i
was
sorry
i
come
for
i
heard
feet
on
the
road
below
and
they
stopped
outside
the
lychgate
quick
says
i
we
caught
like
rats
in
a
trap
if
i
am
going
to
give
you
up
to
please
father
i
may
as
well
please
him
all
round
there
no
reason
why
he
should
know
i
seen
you
we
stole
on
our
tiptoes
round
to
the
little
door
that
is
hardly
ever
fastened
and
so
through
to
the
tower
father
being
one
of
the
bellringers
i
knew
every
step
there
a
stone
seat
cut
out
of
the
wall
in
the
bellringers
loft
and
there
we
sat
down
again
and
i
was
just
going
to
tell
him
again
what
i
had
said
in
the
letter
about
being
his
sister
and
a
friend
which
seemed
to
comfort
me
somehow
though
william
has
told
me
since
it
never
would
have
him
when
william
he
gripped
my
hand
like
iron
and
says
he
and
i
listened
and
oh
what
i
felt
when
i
heard
footsteps
coming
up
the
tower
i
did
dare
speak
a
word
to
him
and
only
kept
tight
hold
of
his
hand
and
pulled
him
along
till
we
got
to
the
tower
steps
and
went
on
up
but
i
says
to
myself
what
my
head
made
of
to
forget
that
it
practising
night
and
him
the
church
was
built
for
only
knows
how
long
they
wo
be
here
practising
we
went
on
up
the
twisted
cobwebby
stairs
with
bits
of
broken
birds
nests
that
crackled
under
our
feet
that
loud
i
thought
for
sure
the
folks
below
must
hear
us
and
we
got
into
the
belfry
and
there
william
was
for
staying
but
i
whispered
to
him
you
hear
them
bells
when
they
all
you
wo
never
hear
much
else
we
must
get
on
up
out
of
it
unless
we
want
to
be
deaf
the
rest
of
our
lives
and
it
was
pitch
dark
in
the
belfry
except
for
the
little
grey
slits
where
the
shuttered
windows
are
the
owls
and
starlings
were
frightened
i
suppose
at
hearing
us
though
why
they
should
have
been
i
do
know
being
used
to
the
bells
and
they
flew
about
round
us
liker
ghosts
than
anything
feathered
and
one
great
owl
flopped
out
right
into
my
face
till
i
nearly
screamed
again
it
was
all
very
very
dusty
and
not
being
able
to
see
and
being
afraid
to
strike
a
light
we
had
to
feel
along
the
big
beams
for
our
way
between
the
bells
i
going
first
because
i
knew
the
way
and
reaching
back
a
hand
every
now
and
then
to
see
that
william
was
coming
after
me
safe
and
sound
on
hands
and
knees
we
had
to
go
for
safety
and
all
the
while
i
was
dreading
they
would
start
the
bells
and
maybe
shake
william
who
was
as
used
to
it
as
i
was
off
the
beams
and
him
perhaps
be
smashed
to
pieces
by
the
bells
as
they
swung
i
do
know
how
long
it
took
us
to
get
across
the
belfry
to
the
corner
where
the
ladder
is
that
leads
up
to
the
william
says
it
must
have
been
about
a
couple
of
minutes
but
i
think
it
was
much
more
like
half
an
hour
i
thought
we
should
never
get
there
and
oh
what
it
was
to
me
when
i
came
to
the
end
of
the
last
beam
and
got
my
foot
down
on
the
firm
floor
again
and
the
ladder
in
my
hand
and
william
behind
me
so
up
we
went
me
first
again
because
i
knew
the
way
and
the
fastenings
of
the
door
and
that
part
of
it
was
so
bad
for
i
will
say
if
you
got
to
go
up
a
long
ladder
it
better
to
go
up
in
the
dark
when
you
ca
see
what
below
you
if
you
happen
to
slip
and
i
got
up
and
opened
the
door
and
it
was
light
out
of
doors
and
fresh
with
the
rain
though
that
had
stopped
now
then
william
would
take
his
coat
off
and
put
it
round
me
for
all
i
begged
him
not
and
presently
the
tower
began
to
shake
and
the
bells
began
and
directly
they
began
i
knew
what
they
was
up
to
william
i
says
grandsire
triples
and
there
five
thousand
and
fifty
changes
to
and
it
a
matter
of
three
hours
but
he
could
hear
a
word
i
said
for
the
bells
so
then
i
took
his
coat
and
my
shawl
and
we
wrapped
them
round
both
our
heads
to
shut
the
bells
out
and
then
we
could
hear
each
other
speak
inside
i
not
going
to
write
down
all
i
said
nor
all
he
said
which
was
only
foolishness
and
besides
it
come
to
nothing
after
all
but
somehow
the
time
was
long
and
it
a
funny
thing
but
unhappy
and
happy
you
can
be
at
the
same
time
when
you
are
with
one
you
love
and
are
going
to
leave
william
he
begged
and
prayed
of
me
not
to
give
him
up
but
i
said
i
knew
my
duty
and
he
said
he
hoped
i
would
think
better
of
it
and
i
said
never
and
then
we
kissed
each
other
again
and
the
bells
went
on
and
on
and
on
clingle
clangle
clingle
chim
chime
chim
chime
till
i
was
dazed
and
felt
as
if
i
had
lived
up
there
all
my
life
and
was
going
to
live
up
there
twenty
lives
longer
wait
for
you
all
my
life
long
says
william
that
i
wish
the
old
man
any
harm
but
it
not
in
the
nature
of
things
your
father
can
live
for
ever
and
then
ai
no
use
thinking
of
that
william
said
i
is
sure
to
make
me
promise
never
to
have
you
when
he
dying
and
i
refuse
him
anything
it
just
the
kind
of
thing
he
think
of
perhaps
you
will
think
william
ought
to
have
made
more
stand
for
everybody
likes
a
masterful
man
but
what
stand
can
you
make
when
you
are
up
in
a
belfry
with
the
bells
shouting
and
yelling
at
you
and
when
the
girl
you
are
with
wo
listen
to
reason
and
you
have
no
idea
what
them
bells
were
often
and
often
since
then
i
have
started
up
in
the
bed
thinking
i
heard
them
again
it
was
enough
to
drive
one
distracted
says
william
give
me
up
but
i
never
give
you
up
and
you
mark
my
words
you
and
me
will
be
man
and
wife
some
day
and
as
he
said
it
the
bells
stopped
sudden
in
the
middle
of
a
change
the
rain
had
come
on
again
it
was
very
chill
up
there
my
teeth
was
chattering
and
so
was
william
though
he
pretended
he
did
it
for
the
joke
get
inside
again
says
he
they
are
going
home
and
if
they
are
not
we
can
stay
there
till
they
begin
it
again
so
we
opened
the
door
and
crept
down
the
ladder
there
was
light
now
coming
up
from
the
bellringers
loft
through
the
holes
in
the
floor
and
we
got
down
to
the
belfry
easy
and
as
we
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
i
heard
my
father
voice
in
the
loft
below
do
believe
it
he
was
shouting
ca
be
true
she
a
girl
and
then
i
heard
my
mother
home
james
she
said
home
it
true
i
told
you
you
was
too
hard
on
them
young
folks
will
be
young
folks
and
now
perhaps
our
little
girl
has
come
to
shame
instead
of
being
married
decent
as
she
might
have
been
though
roman
then
there
was
silence
for
a
bit
and
then
my
father
says
speaking
softer
me
again
i
ca
think
but
what
i
dreaming
then
mother
says
i
tell
you
she
said
she
got
the
toothache
and
she
was
going
to
lie
down
a
bit
and
i
went
to
take
her
up
some
camomiles
i
been
hotting
and
she
was
there
and
her
bolsters
and
pillows
poor
lamb
made
up
to
pretend
she
was
and
johnson
ben
he
see
her
along
of
william
birt
by
the
shave
with
his
arm
round
her
god
forgive
them
both
then
says
my
father
an
end
o
she
no
daughter
o
mine
if
she
was
to
come
back
to
me
i
turn
her
out
of
doors

any
one
name

name
to
me
never
no
more

hai

no
daughter
he
said
may
the
lord
i
think
my
mother
put
her
hands
afore
his
mouth
for
he
stopped
short
and
mother
she
said

them

you
be
sorry
for
it
and
they
have
trouble
enough
without
that
and
with
that
father
and
mother
must
have
gone
away
and
the
other
ringers
stood
talking
a
bit
best
not
come
back
said
the
leader
john
evans
with
a
young
chap
from
five
to
eight
as
i
understand
what
the
good
of
coming
back
she
lost
her
character
and
a
gal
without
a
character
she
like
like
a
without
a
licence
said
the
second
ringer
a
cart
without
a
horse
said
the
treble
there
was
only
one
man
spoke
up
for
me
that
was
jim
piper
at
the
general
shop
do
believe
no
harm
of
that
gal
says
he
more
nor
i
would
of
my
own
missus
nor
yet
of
him
let
hope
for
the
best
said
the
others
but
i
had
a
sort
of
feeling
they
was
hoping
for
the
worst
because
when
things
goes
wrong
it
always
more
amusing
for
the
than
when
everything
goes
right
presently
they
went
clattering
down
the
steps
and
all
was
dark
and
there
was
me
and
william
among
the
cobwebs
and
the
owls
holding
each
other
hands
and
as
cold
as
stone
both
of
us
says
william
when
everything
was
quiet
again
says
i
william
he
wo
be
as
hard
as
his
word
and
if
i
could
give
you
all
my
life
to
be
a
good
wife
to
you
i
have
given
you
my
character
it
seems
not
willing
it
true
but
there
nothing
i
should
grudge
you
william
and
i
do
regret
it
and
but
he
held
my
hands
tight
william
i
says
again
going
i
going
home
my
girl
says
he
are
going
home
you
going
home
with
me
to
my
mother
and
he
was
masterful
enough
then
i
can
tell
you
your
father
would
throw
you
off
without
knowing
the
rights
or
wrongs
of
the
story
it
not
for
him
you
should
be
giving
up
your
happiness
and
mine
my
girl
come
home
to
my
mother
and
let
me
see
the
man
who
dares
to
say
anything
against
my
wife
and
whether
it
was
father
being
so
hard
and
saying
what
he
did
about
me
before
all
those
men
or
whether
it
was
me
knowing
that
mother
had
stood
up
for
us
secret
all
the
time
or
whether
it
was
because
i
loved
william
so
much
or
because
he
loved
me
so
much
i
do
know
but
i
did
say
another
word
only
began
to
cry
and
we
got
downstairs
and
straight
home
to
william
mother
and
we
told
her
all
about
it
and
we
was
cried
in
church
next
sunday
and
i
stayed
with
the
old
lady
until
we
was
married
and
many
a
year
after
and
a
good
mother
she
was
to
me
though
only
in
law
and
a
good
granny
to
our
children
when
they
come
and
i
was
so
unhappy
as
you
may
think
because
mother
come
to
see
me
directly
and
she
was
at
our
wedding
and
father
he
did
say
anything
to
prevent
her
going
when
i
was
churched
after
my
first
and
the
boy
was
christened
in
our
own
church
for
i
had
made
william
promise
it
should
be
so
if
ever
we
had
any
mother
was
there
and
she
said
to
me
the
child
she
said
go
to
your
father
at
home
and
when
he
sees
the
child
he
come
round
i
lay
a
crown
for
his
bark
she
says
allus
worse
than
his
bite
and
i
did
so
and
the
pears
was
hard
and
red
on
the
wall
as
they
was
the
night
william
climbed
up
to
my
window
and
i
went
into
the
kitchen
and
there
was
father
sitting
in
his
big
chair
and
the
bible
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
with
his
spectacles
but
he
was
reading
and
if
it
had
been
any
one
else
but
father
i
should
have
said
he
had
been
crying
and
so
i
went
in
and
i
showed
him
the
baby
and
i
said
father
here
our
little
baby
and
he
named
james
for
you
father
and
christened
in
church
the
same
as
i
was
and
now
i
have
got
a
child
of
my
own
says
i
for
he
did
speak
father
i
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
child
of
your
own
go
against
your
wishes
and
please
god
mine
never
will
or
against
yours
either
but
i
could
help
it
and
o
father
do
forgive
me
and
he
did
say
anything
but
he
kissed
the
boy
and
he
kissed
him
again
and
presently
he
says
time
your
mother
was
home
from
church
wo
you
be
setting
the
tea
kate
so
i
give
him
the
baby
to
hold
for
i
knew
everything
was
all
right
betwixt
us
and
all
the
children
have
been
christened
in
the
church
but
i
think
when
father
is
taken
from
us
which
in
the
nature
of
things
he
must
be
though
long
may
it
be
first
i
think
i
shall
be
a
roman
catholic
too
for
it
does
seem
to
me
to
matter
much
one
way
or
the
other
and
it
would
please
william
very
much
and
i
am
sure
it
would
hurt
me
and
what
the
good
of
being
married
to
the
best
man
in
the
world
if
you
ca
do
a
little
thing
like
that
to
please
him
a
confession
and
so
you
think
i
shall
go
to
heaven
when
i
die
sir
and
why
because
i
have
spent
my
time
and
what
bits
of
money
i
had
in
looking
after
the
poor
in
this
parish
and
i
would
do
it
again
if
i
had
my
time
to
come
over
again
but
it
will
take
more
than
that
to
wipe
out
my
sins
and
god
forgive
me
if
i
ca
always
believe
that
even
his
mercy
will
be
equal
to
it
you
a
clergyman
and
you
ought
to
know
i
think
sometimes
the
black
heart
in
me
that
started
me
on
that
deed
must
have
come
from
the
devil
and
that
i
am
his
child
after
all
and
shall
go
back
to
him
at
the
last
do
look
so
shocked
sir
that
not
what
i
really
believe
it
only
what
i
sometimes
fear
i
ought
to
believe
when
i
wake
up
in
the
chill
night
and
think
things
over
lying
here
alone
to
see
me
old
and
prim
with
my
cap
and
little
checked
shawl
never
think
that
i
was
once
one
of
the
two
prettiest
girls
on
all
the
south
downs
but
i
was
and
my
cousin
lilian
was
the
other
we
lived
at
whitecroft
together
at
our
uncle
he
was
a
farmer
as
as
a
farmer
could
be
in
such
times
as
those
and
on
such
land
as
that
whenever
i
hear
people
say
it
whitecroft
i
think
of
with
its
narrow
windows
and
thatch
roof
and
the
about
it
and
the
bits
of
trees
all
bent
one
way
with
the
wind
from
the
sea
whitecroft
stands
on
a
shoulder
of
the
downs
and
on
a
clear
day
you
can
see
right
out
to
sea
and
over
the
hollow
where
felscombe
lies
cuddled
down
close
and
warm
with
its
elms
and
its
church
and
its
bright
bits
of
gardens
they
are
sheltered
from
the
sea
wind
down
there
but
there
nothing
to
break
the
wing
of
it
as
it
rolls
across
the
downs
on
to
whitecroft
and
of
a
night
lilian
and
i
used
to
lie
and
listen
to
the
wind
banging
the
windows
and
know
that
the
chimneys
were
rocking
over
our
heads
and
feel
the
house
move
to
and
fro
with
the
strength
of
the
wind
like
as
if
it
was
the
swing
of
a
cradle
lilian
and
i
had
come
there
little
things
and
uncle
had
brought
us
up
together
and
we
loved
each
other
like
sisters
until
that
happened
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
told
a
human
soul
about
it
and
if
being
sorry
can
pay
for
things
well
but
i
afraid
there
are
some
things
nothing
can
pay
for
it
was
one
wild
windy
night
when
if
you
should
open
the
door
an
inch
everything
in
the
house
jarred
and
rattled
we
were
sitting
round
the
fire
uncle
and
lilian
and
me
us
with
our
knitting
and
him
asleep
in
his
newspaper
and
nobody
could
have
gone
to
sleep
with
a
wind
like
that
but
a
man
who
has
been
bred
and
born
at
sea
or
on
the
south
downs
lilian
and
i
were
talking
over
our
new
winter
dresses
when
there
come
a
knock
at
the
side
door
not
nigh
so
loud
as
some
of
the
noises
the
wind
made
but
not
being
used
to
it
uncle
sat
up
wide
awake
and
said
in
a
minute
it
come
again
and
then
i
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
a
bit
there
was
some
one
outside
who
began
to
speak
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
light
but
i
could
not
hear
what
he
said
for
the
roaring
of
the
wind
and
the
cracking
of
the
trees
outside
that
door
uncle
shouted
from
the
parlour
the
dog
in
whatever
he
is
and
let
him
tell
his
tale
this
side
the
oak
so
i
let
him
in
and
shut
the
door
after
him
and
i
had
better
have
shut
to
the
lid
of
my
own
coffin
after
me
him
that
i
let
in
was
dripping
wet
and
all
spent
with
fighting
the
wind
on
these
downs
where
it
is
like
a
lion
roaring
for
its
prey
and
will
go
nigh
to
kill
you
if
you
fight
it
long
enough
he
leaned
against
the
wall
and
said
have
lost
my
way
and
i
have
had
a
nasty
fall
i
think
there
is
something
wrong
with
my
arm
hollow
slip
light
hospitality
beg
your
pardon
i
sure
and
with
that
he
fainted
dead
off
on
the
cocoanut
matting
at
my
feet
uncle
came
out
when
i
screamed
and
we
got
the
stranger
in
and
put
him
on
the
big
couch
by
the
fire
uncle
was
nursing
up
with
one
of
his
bad
attacks
of
bronchitis
the
same
thing
that
carried
him
off
in
the
end
and
the
first
thing
he
said
when
he
felt
the
poor
chap
arm
down
was
is
a
bad
break
which
of
you
girls
will
go
and
wake
one
of
the
waggoners
to
fetch
doctor
from
felscombe
will
i
said
but
before
i
went
i
got
out
the
port
wine
and
the
brandy
and
bade
lilian
rub
his
hands
a
bit
and
be
sure
she
did
let
him
see
her
looking
frightened
when
he
come
to
why
did
i
do
that
because
the
lord
made
me
to
be
a
fool
giving
him
her
pretty
face
to
be
the
first
thing
he
looked
at
when
he
come
to
after
that
long
dreary
spell
on
the
downs
and
that
black
journey
into
the
strange
place
where
people
go
to
when
they
faint
but
everything
that
there
was
of
me
ached
to
be
of
some
use
to
him
so
i
went
and
once
outside
the
door
it
seemed
easier
to
take
brown
bess
and
go
myself
to
felscombe
than
to
rouse
the
waggoners
who
were
but
sleepy
and
at
the
best
of
times
so
i
saddled
brown
bess
myself
and
started
it
was
but
a
small
way
across
the
downs
that
i
had
to
lead
her
it
being
almost
as
much
as
both
of
us
could
do
to
keep
our
feet
in
the
fury
of
the
wind
then
you
go
down
the
steep
hill
into
the
village
and
as
soon
as
we
had
passed
the
brow
it
was
easy
and
i
mounted
i
was
down
there
in
less
time
than
it
would
have
taken
to
rouse
one
of
those
carters
and
doctor
he
come
back
with
me
walking
beside
brown
bess
with
his
hand
on
her
bridle
he
not
being
by
any
means
loth
to
come
out
such
a
night
because
forsooth
it
was
me
that
fetched
him
oh
yes
i
might
have
married
him
if
i
had
wanted
to
and
more
than
one
better
man
than
him
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
when
we
got
in
we
found
lilian
kneeling
by
the
sofa
rubbing
the
young
man
hands
as
i
had
told
her
to
and
his
eyes
were
open
and
there
was
a
bit
of
colour
in
his
cheek
and
he
was
looking
at
her
like
as
any
one
but
a
fool
might
have
known
he
would
look
and
the
doctor
he
saw
it
too
and
looked
at
me
and
grinned
and
if
i
had
been
god
that
grin
should
have
been
his
last
no
i
do
mean
to
be
irreverent
but
it
true
all
the
same
well
the
arm
was
set
and
when
he
was
a
bit
easier
we
settled
round
the
fire
and
he
told
us
that
his
name
was
edgar
linley
and
he
was
an
artist
and
had
been
painting
the
angry
sunset
that
had
come
before
that
night
storm
and
got
caught
in
the
dusk
and
so
lost
his
way
as
many
do
on
our
downs
at
home
some
not
so
lucky
as
him
to
see
a
light
and
get
to
it
this
linley
had
a
way
with
him
like
no
other
man
i
ever
see
not
only
a
way
to
please
women
with
but
men
too
i
never
saw
my
uncle
so
taken
up
with
anybody
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
was
that
he
stayed
there
a
month
and
we
nursed
him
and
at
the
end
of
the
month
i
knew
no
more
than
i
had
known
that
evening
when
i
had
seen
him
looking
at
lilian
but
he
and
lilian
they
had
learned
a
deal
in
that
time
and
one
evening
i
was
at
my
bedroom
window
and
i
see
them
coming
up
the
path
in
the
red
light
of
the
evening
walking
very
close
together
and
i
went
down
very
quick
to
the
parlour
where
uncle
was
just
come
in
to
his
tea
and
taking
his
big
boots
off
and
i
sat
down
there
for
i
wanted
to
hear
how
they
say
it
though
i
knew
well
enough
what
they
had
got
to
say
and
they
came
in
and
he
says
very
frank
and
cheery
verinder
he
says
and
i
have
made
up
our
minds
to
take
each
other
with
your
consent
for
better
for
worse
and
uncle
was
as
pleased
as
punch
and
as
for
me
i
did
believe
in
god
then
or
i
should
have
prayed
him
to
strike
them
both
down
dead
as
they
stood
why
did
i
hate
them
so
and
you
call
yourself
a
man
and
a
parson
and
one
that
knows
the
heart
of
man
why
did
i
hate
them
because
i
loved
him
as
no
woman
will
ever
love
you
sir
if
you
pardon
me
being
so
bold
if
you
live
to
be
a
thousand
he
would
have
understood
all
about
everything
with
half
what
i
have
been
telling
you
as
it
is
i
sometimes
think
that
he
understood
for
he
was
very
gentle
with
me
and
kind
not
making
too
much
of
lilian
when
i
was
by
yet
never
with
a
look
or
a
word
that
the
look
and
the
word
of
her
good
true
lover
and
she
was
very
happy
for
she
loved
him
as
much
as
that
teacup
kind
of
woman
can
love
and
that
more
than
i
thought
for
at
the
time
he
was
an
orphan
and
well
off
and
there
was
nothing
to
wait
for
so
the
wedding
was
fixed
for
early
in
the
new
year
and
i
sewed
at
her
new
clothes
with
a
marrow
of
lead
in
every
bone
of
my
fingers
a
truly
understanding
person
might
get
some
meaning
out
of
my
words
when
i
say
that
i
loved
her
in
my
heart
all
the
time
that
i
was
hating
her
and
the
devil
himself
must
have
sent
out
my
soul
and
made
use
of
the
rest
of
me
on
that
night
i
shall
tell
you
about
presently
it
was
in
the
sharp
short
frosty
days
that
brought
in
christmas
that
uncle
came
home
one
day
from
lewes
looking
thunder
black
with
an
eye
like
fire
and
a
mouth
like
stone
and
he
walked
straight
into
the
kitchen
where
we
three
were
making
toast
for
tea
for
edgar
was
one
of
us
by
this
time
and
lent
a
hand
at
all
such
little
things
as
young
folks
can
be
merry
over
together
and
uncle
says
my
house
young
man
it
an
honest
house
and
a
clean
and
no
fit
place
for
a
sinful
swine
get
out
he
says
for
without
are
dogs
with
that
he
went
on
with
a
long
text
of
revelation
that
i
repeat
to
you
sir
for
i
know
your
ears
are
nice
and
it
out
of
one
of
the
parts
of
the
bible
edgar
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
swear
to
god
he
said
was
to
blame
i
know
what
you
have
heard
but
if
i
ca
whiten
myself
without
blacking
a
woman
i
live
and
die
as
black
as
hell
he
says
i
do
need
whitening
with
those
that
love
me
he
says
looking
at
lilian
and
then
at
me
oh
yes
he
looked
at
me
then
i
said
indeed
and
so
did
lilian
but
she
began
to
cry
and
before
we
had
time
to
think
what
it
was
all
about
he
had
taken
his
hat
and
kissed
lilian
and
was
gone
but
he
turned
back
at
the
door
again
write
to
you
he
says
to
lilian
i
do
cross
this
door
again
till
those
words
are
unsaid
and
so
he
was
gone
him
being
gone
uncle
told
us
what
he
had
heard
in
lewes
and
what
all
folks
there
believed
to
be
the
truth
how
young
edgar
had
carried
on
as
men
may
not
with
a
young
married
woman
the
wife
where
he
lodged
the
end
of
it
being
that
she
drowned
herself
in
a
pond
near
by
leaving
as
her
last
word
that
he
was
the
cause
of
it
and
so
he
may
have
been
but
not
the
way
my
uncle
and
the
folk
at
lewes
thought
i
stake
my
soul
god
makes
his
troubles
in
dozens
he
do
make
a
new
patterned
one
for
every
back
i
the
only
woman
who
ever
loved
edgar
linley
without
encouragement
and
without
hope
and
risked
her
soul
because
she
was
mad
with
loving
him
but
when
uncle
had
told
us
all
this
with
a
black
look
on
his
face
i
never
had
seen
before
he
said
i
have
always
been
a
clean
liver
and
i
have
brought
you
up
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
i
do
want
to
judge
any
man
and
lilian
is
of
age
and
her
own
mistress
it
not
for
me
to
say
what
she
shall
or
sha
do
but
if
she
marries
that
scoundrel
she
has
my
curse
here
and
hereafter
and
not
one
penny
of
my
money
if
it
was
to
save
her
from
the
workhouse
after
that
we
were
sad
enough
at
whitecroft
but
in
two
days
come
a
letter
from
edgar
to
lilian
and
when
she
had
read
it
she
looked
at
me
and
said
isabel
whatever
shall
i
do
i
never
can
marry
without
dear
uncle
consent
and
i
turned
and
went
from
her
without
a
word
because
i
could
bear
to
see
her
arguing
and
considering
what
to
do
when
the
best
thing
in
the
world
was
to
her
hand
for
the
taking
all
the
next
week
she
cried
all
day
and
most
of
the
night
then
uncle
went
to
london
my
belief
being
it
was
to
alter
his
will
so
that
if
lilian
married
edgar
she
should
feel
it
in
her
pocket
anyhow
and
he
was
to
stay
all
night
and
the
farm
servants
slept
out
of
the
house
and
we
were
without
a
maid
at
the
time
so
lilian
and
me
were
left
alone
at
whitecroft
lilian
and
i
did
sleep
in
one
room
now
i
had
made
some
excuse
to
sleep
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
because
i
could
bear
to
wake
up
of
mornings
and
see
her
lying
there
so
pretty
looking
like
a
lily
in
her
white
nightgown
and
her
fair
hair
all
tumbled
about
her
face
it
was
more
than
any
woman
could
have
borne
to
see
her
lying
there
and
think
that
early
in
the
new
year
it
was
him
that
would
see
her
lying
like
that
of
a
morning
and
that
night
the
place
seemed
very
quiet
and
empty
as
if
there
was
more
room
in
it
for
being
unhappy
in
when
lilian
had
taken
her
candle
and
gone
up
to
bed
i
walked
through
all
the
rooms
below
as
uncle
habit
was
to
see
that
all
was
fast
for
the
night
it
was
as
i
set
the
bolt
on
the
door
of
the
little
shed
where
the
faggots
were
kept
that
the
devil
entered
into
me
all
in
a
breath
and
i
thought
of
lilian
upstairs
in
her
white
bed
and
of
how
the
day
must
come
when
he
would
see
how
pretty
she
looked
and
white
and
i
said
to
myself
it
never
shall
not
if
i
burn
for
it
too
i
hope
you
are
understanding
me
i
sometimes
think
there
is
something
done
to
folks
when
they
are
learning
to
be
parsons
as
takes
out
of
them
a
part
of
a
natural
person
understandingness
and
i
would
rather
have
told
the
doctor
but
then
he
could
have
told
me
whether
these
are
the
kind
of
things
christ
died
to
make
his
father
forgive
and
i
suppose
you
can
what
i
did
was
this
i
clean
forgot
all
about
uncle
and
how
fond
i
was
of
whitecroft
and
how
much
i
had
always
loved
lilian
and
i
loved
her
then
though
i
know
you
ca
understand
me
when
i
say
so
and
i
took
all
them
faggots
dragging
them
across
the
sanded
floor
of
the
kitchen
and
i
put
them
in
the
parlour
in
the
little
wing
to
the
left
and
just
under
lilian
bedroom
and
i
laid
them
under
the
wooden
corner
cupboard
where
the
best
china
is
and
then
i
poured
oil
and
brandy
all
over
and
set
it
alight
then
i
put
on
my
hat
and
jacket
buttoning
it
all
the
way
down
as
quiet
as
if
i
was
going
down
to
the
village
for
a
pound
of
candles
and
i
made
sure
all
was
burning
free
and
out
of
the
front
door
i
went
and
up
on
to
the
downs
and
there
i
set
me
down
under
the
wall
where
i
could
see
whitecroft
and
i
watched
to
see
the
old
place
burn
down
and
at
first
there
was
no
light
to
be
seen
but
presently
i
see
the
parlour
windows
get
redder
and
redder
and
soon
i
knew
the
curtains
had
caught
and
then
there
was
a
light
in
lilian
bedroom
i
see
the
bars
of
the
window
as
you
do
in
the
ruined
mill
when
the
sun
is
setting
behind
it
and
the
light
got
more
and
more
till
i
see
the
stone
above
the
front
door
that
tells
how
it
was
builded
by
one
of
our
name
this
long
time
since
and
at
that
as
sudden
as
he
had
come
the
devil
left
me
and
i
knew
all
in
a
minute
that
i
was
crouched
against
a
wall
very
cold
and
my
hands
hooked
into
my
hair
over
my
ears
and
my
knees
drawn
up
under
my
chin
and
there
was
the
old
house
on
fire
the
dear
old
house
with
lilian
inside
it
in
her
little
white
bed
being
burnt
to
death
and
me
her
murderer
and
with
that
i
got
up
and
i
remember
i
was
stiff
as
if
i
had
been
screwing
myself
all
close
together
to
keep
from
knowing
what
it
was
i
had
been
i
ran
down
the
meadow
to
our
house
faster
than
i
ever
ran
in
my
life
in
at
the
door
and
up
the
stairs
all
blue
and
black
and
hidden
up
with
smoke
i
do
know
how
i
got
up
them
stairs
for
they
were
beginning
to
burn
too
i
opened
her
door
all
red
and
glowing
it
was
inside
like
an
oven
when
you
open
it
to
rake
out
the
ashes
on
a
and
i
tried
to
get
in
because
all
i
wanted
then
was
to
save
her
to
get
her
out
safe
and
sound
if
i
had
to
roast
myself
for
it
because
we
had
been
brought
up
together
from
little
things
and
i
loved
her
like
a
sister
and
while
i
was
trying
to
get
my
jacket
off
and
round
my
head
something
gave
way
right
under
my
feet
and
i
seemed
to
fall
straight
into
hell
i
was
badly
burnt
and
what
handsomeness
there
was
about
my
face
was
pretty
well
scorched
out
of
it
by
that
night
work
and
i
know
anything
for
a
bit
when
i
come
to
myself
they
had
got
me
into
bed
bound
up
with
and
oil
and
things
and
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
sit
up
and
try
to
tear
them
off
kill
yourself
says
the
nurse
you
says
i
the
best
thing
i
can
do
now
lilian
is
dead
and
with
that
the
nurse
gives
a
laugh
that
what
on
your
mind
is
it
says
she
said
there
was
something
miss
lilian
had
run
away
that
night
to
her
young
man
lucky
for
her
she
luckier
than
you
poor
thing
and
they
married
and
living
in
lodgings
at
brighton
and
she
been
over
to
see
you
every
day
that
day
she
came
again
i
lay
still
and
let
her
thank
me
for
having
tried
to
save
her
for
the
farm
men
had
seen
the
fire
and
had
come
up
in
time
to
see
me
go
up
the
staircase
to
her
room
and
they
had
pulled
me
out
she
believes
to
this
day
the
fire
was
an
accident
and
that
i
would
have
sacrificed
my
life
for
her
and
so
i
would
she
right
there
i
was
going
to
make
her
unhappy
by
telling
her
the
real
truth
because
she
was
as
fond
of
me
as
i
was
of
her
and
she
has
been
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
all
her
life
long
and
so
she
deserves
and
as
for
me
i
stayed
on
with
uncle
at
the
farm
until
he
died
of
that
bronchitis
i
told
you
of
and
the
little
wing
was
built
up
again
and
the
lichen
has
grown
on
it
so
that
now
you
could
hardly
tell
it
is
only
forty
years
old
and
he
left
me
all
his
money
and
when
he
died
and
whitecroft
went
to
a
distant
relation
i
came
here
to
do
what
bits
of
good
i
could
and
i
have
never
told
the
truth
about
this
to
any
one
but
you
i
could
have
told
it
to
any
one
as
cared
but
i
know
you
do
so
that
makes
it
easy
her
marriage
lines
i
i
had
never
been
out
to
service
before
and
i
thought
it
a
grand
thing
when
i
got
a
place
at
charleston
farm
old
alderton
was
enough
and
while
he
had
the
management
of
the
farm
it
was
a
place
no
girl
need
have
wished
to
come
to
but
now
alderton
had
given
up
farming
this
year
or
two
and
young
master
harry
he
had
the
management
of
everything
alderton
he
stuck
in
one
room
with
his
books
which
he
was
always
fond
of
above
a
bit
and
must
needs
be
waited
on
hand
and
foot
only
driving
over
to
lewes
every
now
and
then
six
pounds
a
year
i
was
to
have
and
a
little
something
extra
at
christmas
according
as
i
behaved
myself
it
was
master
harry
who
engaged
me
he
rode
up
to
our
cottage
one
fine
may
morning
looking
as
grand
on
his
big
grey
horse
and
says
he
through
the
stamping
clatter
of
his
horse
hoofs
on
the
paved
causeway
you
deresby
poll
says
he
and
i
says
what
might
you
be
wanting
want
a
good
maid
up
at
the
farm
says
he
patting
his
neck
old
boy
and
they
tell
me
you
a
good
girl
that
wants
a
good
place
and
ours
is
a
good
place
that
wants
a
good
girl
so
if
our
wages
suit
you
when
can
you
come
and
i
said
if
that
would
be
convenient
and
he
took
off
his
hat
to
me
as
if
i
was
a
queen
though
i
was
floury
up
to
the
elbows
being
and
rode
off
down
the
lane
between
the
green
trees
and
no
king
could
have
looked
handsomer
charleston
is
a
lonesome
kind
of
house
it
bare
and
white
with
the
farm
buildings
all
round
it
except
on
one
side
where
the
big
pond
is
and
lying
as
it
does
in
the
cup
of
the
hill
it
seems
to
shut
loneliness
in
and
good
company
out
i
was
to
be
under
blake
who
had
been
housekeeper
there
since
the
old
mistress
died
no
one
knew
where
she
came
from
or
what
had
become
of
blake
if
ever
there
had
been
one
for
my
part
i
never
thought
she
was
a
widow
and
always
expected
some
day
to
see
blake
walk
in
and
ask
for
his
wife
but
as
a
widow
she
came
and
as
a
widow
she
passed
she
had
just
that
kind
of
handsome
black
scowling
looks
that
always
seem
to
need
a
lot
of
black
jet
and
crape
to
set
them
off
the
kind
of
complexion
that
seems
to
be
playing
up
for
the
widow
weeds
from
the
very
cradle
i
have
heard
it
said
she
was
handsome
and
so
she
may
have
been
and
she
took
a
deal
of
care
of
her
face
always
wearing
a
veil
when
there
was
a
wind
and
her
hands
to
have
gloves
if
you
please
for
every
bit
of
dirty
work
but
she
was
a
capable
woman
and
she
soon
put
me
in
the
way
of
my
work
and
me
and
betty
who
was
a
little
girl
of
fourteen
from
alfreston
had
most
of
the
housework
to
do
for
blake
would
let
none
of
us
do
a
for
the
old
master
it
was
she
must
do
everything
and
as
he
got
more
and
more
took
up
with
his
books
there
come
to
be
more
and
more
waiting
on
him
in
his
own
room
and
after
a
bit
blake
used
even
to
sit
and
write
for
him
by
the
hour
together
i
have
heard
tell
old
alderton
was
brought
up
to
be
a
farmer
but
was
a
scholar
when
he
was
young
and
had
to
go
into
farming
when
he
married
hakes
daughter
as
brought
the
farm
with
her
and
now
he
had
gone
back
to
his
books
he
was
more
than
ever
took
up
with
the
idea
of
finding
something
out
making
something
new
that
no
one
had
ever
made
before
his
invention
he
called
it
but
i
never
understood
what
it
was
all
about
and
indeed
blake
took
very
good
care
i
should
she
wanted
no
one
to
know
anything
about
the
master
except
herself
at
least
that
was
my
opinion
and
if
that
was
her
wish
she
certainly
got
it
it
was
hard
work
but
i
not
one
to
grudge
a
here
or
a
there
and
i
was
happy
enough
and
when
the
men
came
in
for
their
meals
i
always
had
everything
smoking
hot
and
just
as
i
should
wish
to
sit
down
to
it
myself
and
when
the
men
come
in
master
harry
always
come
in
with
them
and
he
say
and
greens
again
polly
and
done
to
a
turn
i
wager
you
the
girl
for
my
money
and
sit
down
laughing
to
a
smoking
plateful
and
so
i
was
quite
happy
and
with
my
first
six
months
money
i
got
father
a
new
pipe
and
a
comforter
agin
the
winter
and
as
pretty
a
shepherd
plaid
shawl
as
ever
you
see
for
mother
and
a
knitted
waistcoat
for
my
brother
jim
as
had
wanted
one
this
two
year
and
had
enough
left
to
buy
myself
a
bonnet
and
gown
that
i
did
feel
ashamed
to
sit
in
church
in
under
master
harry
own
blue
eye
blake
looked
very
sour
when
she
saw
my
new
things
think
to
catch
a
young
man
with
those
says
she
gells
is
all
alike
but
it
is
fine
feathers
as
catches
a
husband
as
they
say
do
you
believe
it
and
i
said
a
husband
as
was
caught
so
easy
might
be
as
easy
got
rid
of
which
was
convenient
sometimes
and
we
come
nigh
to
having
words
about
it
that
was
the
day
before
old
master
went
off
to
london
unexpected
when
blake
heard
he
was
going
she
said
she
would
take
the
opportunity
of
his
being
away
to
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
him
for
a
day
holiday
to
go
and
visit
her
friends
in
ashford
so
she
and
master
went
in
the
trap
to
the
station
together
and
off
by
the
same
train
and
curious
enough
it
was
by
the
same
train
in
the
evening
they
come
back
and
i
thought
to
myself
like
your
artfulness
blake
getting
a
lift
both
ways
and
i
wondered
to
myself
whether
her
friends
in
ashford
supposing
she
had
any
was
as
glad
to
see
her
as
we
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
her
that
a
day
i
shall
always
remember
for
other
things
than
her
and
master
going
away
that
was
the
day
betty
and
i
got
done
early
and
she
wanted
to
run
home
to
her
mother
to
see
about
her
clean
changes
for
sunday
which
had
come
according
to
expectations
so
i
said
you
go
child
and
mind
you
back
by
tea
and
i
sat
down
in
the
clean
kitchen
to
do
up
my
old
sunday
bonnet
and
make
it
fit
for
everyday
and
as
i
was
sitting
there
with
the
bits
of
ribbons
and
things
in
my
lap
unpicking
the
lining
of
the
bonnet
i
heard
the
back
door
open
and
thinking
it
was
one
of
the
men
bringing
in
wood
maybe
i
did
turn
my
head
and
next
minute
there
was
master
harry
had
got
his
hand
under
my
chin
and
holding
my
head
back
and
was
kissing
me
as
if
he
never
meant
to
stop
bless
you
master
harry
says
i
as
soon
as
i
could
push
him
away
dropping
all
the
ribbons
and
scissors
and
things
in
my
flurry
could
you
fashion
to
behave
so
and
me
alone
in
the
house
i
thought
you
had
better
sense
be
cross
polly
says
he
smiling
at
me
till
i
could
have
forgiven
him
much
more
than
that
and
going
down
on
his
knees
to
pick
up
my
bits
of
rubbish
know
well
enough
who
my
choice
is
i
have
lived
in
the
house
with
you
six
months
without
finding
out
there
only
one
girl
as
i
should
like
to
keep
my
house
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
he
had
that
took
me
by
surprise
that
i
give
you
my
word
that
for
a
minute
or
two
i
could
say
anything
but
sat
looking
like
a
fool
and
taking
the
ribbons
and
things
from
his
hands
as
he
picked
them
up
when
i
come
to
my
senses
i
said
do
know
what
maggot
has
bit
you
sir
to
think
of
such
nonsense
what
would
the
master
say
and
blake
and
all
well
he
got
up
off
his
knees
and
walked
up
and
down
the
kitchen
twice
in
a
pretty
fume
and
he
said
a
bad
word
about
what
blake
might
say
that
i
not
going
to
write
down
here
as
for
my
father
says
he
know
he
ideas
above
fitting
for
farmer
folk
but
i
know
best
what
the
right
choice
for
me
and
if
you
wo
mind
me
not
telling
him
and
will
wait
for
me
patient
and
will
give
me
a
kind
word
and
a
kiss
on
a
sunday
so
to
say
you
and
me
will
be
happy
together
and
you
shall
be
mistress
of
the
farm
when
the
poor
old
dad
time
comes
to
go
not
that
i
wish
his
time
nearer
by
an
hour
for
all
i
love
you
so
dear
polly
and
i
hope
i
did
what
was
right
though
it
was
with
a
sore
heart
for
i
said
could
stay
on
in
your
folks
house
to
have
secret
understandings
with
you
master
harry
that
ai
to
be
thought
of
but
i
do
say
this
likely
that
i
shall
marry
any
other
chap
and
if
when
you
come
to
be
master
of
charleston
you
are
in
the
same
mind
why
you
can
speak
your
mind
to
me
again
and
i
listen
to
you
then
with
a
freer
heart
maybe
than
i
can
and
with
that
i
bundled
all
my
odds
and
ends
into
the
dresser
drawer
and
took
the
kettle
off
which
was
over
now
i
says
more
of
this
talk
if
you
and
me
is
to
keep
friends
hands
on
it
says
he
a
good
girl
polly
and
i
see
more
than
ever
what
a
lucky
man
i
shall
be
the
day
i
go
to
church
with
you
and
i
not
say
another
word
till
i
can
say
it
afore
all
the
world
with
you
to
answer
yes
for
all
the
world
to
hear
so
that
was
settled
and
of
course
from
that
time
i
kept
myself
more
than
ever
to
myself
not
even
passing
the
time
of
day
with
a
young
man
if
i
could
help
it
because
i
wanted
to
keep
all
my
thoughts
and
all
my
words
for
master
harry
if
he
should
ever
want
me
again
ii
well
as
i
said
old
master
and
blake
come
back
together
from
the
station
and
from
that
day
forward
blake
was
unbearabler
than
ever
and
one
day
when
sigglesfield
the
lawyer
from
lewes
was
in
the
parlour
she
to
him
after
he
been
up
to
see
master
about
his
will
no
doubt
she
opened
the
parlour
door
sharp
and
sudden
just
as
i
was
bringing
the
tea
for
her
to
have
it
with
him
like
a
lady
she
opened
the
door
sudden
as
i
say
and
boxed
my
ears
as
i
stood
and
i
should
have
dropped
the
but
for
me
being
brought
up
a
careful
girl
and
taught
always
to
hold
on
to
the
with
all
my
fingers
i
proud
to
say
i
did
say
a
word
but
i
put
down
that
and
walked
into
the
kitchen
with
my
ear
as
hot
as
fire
and
my
temper
to
match
which
was
no
wonder
and
no
disgrace
then
she
come
into
the
kitchen
go
this
day
month
miss
she
says
at
doors
when
your
betters
is
i
teach
you
says
she
and
back
she
goes
into
the
parlour
but
i
took
no
notice
of
what
she
said
for
master
harry
he
hired
me
and
i
would
take
no
notice
from
any
one
but
him
sigglesfield
was
pretty
often
just
then
and
harry
he
come
to
me
one
day
and
he
says
all
right
polly
and
i
must
tell
you
because
you
the
same
as
myself
though
i
do
like
to
talk
as
if
we
was
waiting
for
dead
men
shoes
long
may
he
wear
them
but
father
told
me
he
has
left
everything
to
me
right
and
safe
though
i
am
the
second
son
my
brother
john
never
did
get
on
with
father
but
when
all
mine
we
see
that
john
do
starve
and
that
day
week
old
master
was
a
corpse
he
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
and
the
doctor
said
it
was
old
age
and
a
sudden
breaking
up
blake
she
cried
and
took
on
fearful
more
than
was
right
or
natural
and
when
the
will
was
to
be
read
in
the
parlour
after
the
funeral
she
come
into
the
kitchen
where
i
was
sitting
crying
too
not
that
i
was
fond
of
old
master
but
the
kind
of
crying
there
is
at
funerals
is
catching
i
think
and
besides
i
was
sorry
for
master
harry
who
was
a
good
son
and
quite
broken
down
can
come
and
hear
the
will
read
she
says
all
your
impudence
you
hussy
and
i
do
know
why
i
went
in
after
her
impudence
but
i
did
sigglesfield
was
there
and
some
of
the
relations
who
had
come
a
long
way
to
hear
if
they
was
to
pull
anything
out
of
the
fire
and
master
harry
was
there
looking
very
pale
through
all
his
and
says
he
suppose
the
will
got
to
be
read
but
my
father
he
told
me
what
i
was
to
expect
it
all
to
me
and
one
hundred
to
blake
and
five
pounds
apiece
to
the
servants
and
sigglesfield
looks
at
him
out
of
his
ferret
eyes
and
says
very
quietly
think
the
will
had
better
be
read
mr
alderton
i
think
says
blake
tossing
her
head
and
rubbing
her
red
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
at
the
same
minute
almost
and
read
it
was
and
all
us
people
sat
still
as
mice
listening
to
the
wonderful
tale
of
it
for
wonderful
it
was
though
folded
up
very
curious
and
careful
in
a
pack
of
lawyer
talk
and
when
it
was
finished
master
harry
stood
up
on
his
feet
and
he
said
do
understand
your
cursed
lawyer
lingo
does
this
mean
that
my
father
has
left
me
fifty
pounds
and
has
left
the
rest
stock
lock
and
barrel
to
his
wife
martha
who
in
hell
he
says
his
wife
martha
and
at
that
blake
stood
up
and
fetched
a
curtsy
to
the
company
me
she
said
your
leave
married
two
months
come
tuesday
and
here
my
lines
and
there
they
were
there
was
no
getting
over
them
married
at
mary
woolnoth
in
london
by
special
licence
you
wicked
old
jezebel
says
master
harry
shaking
his
fist
at
her
a
fine
end
for
a
young
man
hopes
is
it
true
says
he
turning
to
the
lawyer
and
sigglesfield
shakes
his
head
and
says
am
afraid
so
my
poor
fellow
indeed
cries
blake
of
my
house
my
young
gamecock
get
out
and
crow
on
your
own
dunghill
if
you
can
find
one
and
harry
turned
and
went
without
a
word
then
i
slipped
out
too
and
i
snatched
my
old
bonnet
and
shawl
off
their
peg
in
the
kitchen
and
i
ran
down
the
lane
after
him
says
i
and
he
turned
and
looked
at
me
like
something
that
hunted
looks
when
it
gets
in
a
corner
and
turns
on
you
then
i
got
up
with
him
and
caught
hold
of
his
arm
with
both
my
hands
mind
the
dirty
money
says
i
a
bit
of
money
i
says
is
it
my
dear
compared
with
true
love
i
work
my
fingers
to
the
bone
for
you
says
i
we
better
off
than
her
when
all
said
and
done
we
are
my
girl
says
he
and
the
savage
look
went
out
of
his
face
and
he
kissed
me
for
the
second
time
then
we
went
home
to
my
mother
and
we
told
father
and
mother
all
about
it
and
mother
made
harry
up
a
bit
of
a
bed
on
the
settle
and
he
stayed
with
us
till
he
could
pull
himself
together
and
see
what
was
best
to
be
done
iii
of
course
our
first
thought
was
she
really
married
and
it
was
settled
betwixt
us
that
harry
should
go
up
to
london
to
the
church
named
in
her
marriage
lines
and
see
if
it
was
a
real
marriage
or
a
like
what
you
read
of
in
the
weekly
papers
and
harry
went
up
i
settling
to
go
the
same
day
to
fetch
my
clothes
from
charleston
so
as
soon
as
i
had
seen
him
off
by
the
train
i
walked
up
to
charleston
and
father
with
me
to
fetch
my
things
blake
for
alderton
i
ca
and
wo
call
her
was
out
and
i
was
able
to
get
my
bits
of
things
together
comfortable
without
her
fussing
and
interfering
but
there
was
a
pair
of
scissors
of
mine
i
could
find
and
i
looked
for
them
high
and
low
till
i
remembered
that
i
had
lent
them
to
blake
the
week
before
so
i
went
to
her
room
to
look
for
them
thinking
no
harm
and
there
looking
in
her
corner
cupboard
for
my
scissors
as
i
had
a
right
to
do
i
found
something
else
that
i
had
been
looking
for
and
right
or
wrong
i
put
that
in
my
pocket
and
said
nothing
to
father
and
so
we
went
home
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
harry
he
came
in
by
the
last
train
looking
tired
and
gloomy
were
married
right
enough
he
said
seen
the
register
and
i
seen
the
clerk
and
he
remembers
them
being
married
you
better
have
a
bit
of
supper
my
boy
says
mother
and
takes
it
smoking
hot
out
of
the
oven
the
next
day
when
i
had
cleared
away
breakfast
i
stood
looking
into
the
street
it
was
a
cold
day
and
a
day
when
nobody
would
be
out
of
doors
that
could
anyways
be
in
i
should
have
had
my
nose
out
of
the
door
myself
except
that
i
wanted
to
turn
my
back
on
other
folks
now
and
think
of
what
i
had
found
at
charleston
for
i
had
even
told
harry
of
it
yet
and
as
i
sat
there
who
should
come
along
but
the
postman
as
is
my
second
cousin
by
the
mother
side
and
polly
says
he
do
change
they
tell
me
young
alderton
is
biding
with
your
folks
now
tell
you
true
for
once
says
i
worth
my
while
to
be
trapesing
that
mile
and
a
quarter
to
leave
a
letter
at
the
farm
i
take
it
especially
as
it
a
registered
letter
and
him
not
there
to
sign
for
it
so
i
calls
harry
out
who
was
smoking
a
pipe
in
the
as
humped
and
gloomy
as
a
fowl
on
a
wet
day
and
he
was
as
surprised
as
me
at
getting
a
letter
with
a
london
postmark
and
registered
too
and
he
was
that
surprised
that
he
kept
turning
it
over
and
over
and
wondering
who
it
could
have
come
from
till
we
thought
it
would
be
the
best
way
to
open
and
see
and
we
did
i
blowed
says
harry
and
then
he
read
it
out
to
me
it
was
dear
brother
i
have
seen
in
the
papers
the
melancholy
account
of
our
poor
father
decease
and
the
disastrous
circumstances
of
his
second
marriage
and
the
more
i
have
thought
of
it
the
more
it
seems
to
me
that
there
was
a
screw
loose
somewhere
i
had
the
misfortune
as
you
know
to
offend
him
by
my
choice
of
a
profession
but
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
have
risen
from
to
and
am
doing
well
have
made
a
few
inquiries
about
the
movements
of
our
lamented
father
and
blake
on
the
day
when
they
were
united
and
if
the
same
will
be
agreeable
to
you
i
will
come
down
sunday
morning
and
talk
matters
over
with
i
remain
my
dear
brother
your
affectionate
brother
john
i
shall
register
the
letter
to
make
sure
telegraph
if
you
would
like
me
to
come
well
we
telegraphed
though
mother
does
hold
with
such
things
looking
on
it
as
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
and
natural
but
we
got
it
all
in
with
the
address
for
sixpence
and
harry
was
as
pleased
as
punch
to
think
of
seeing
his
brother
again
but
mother
said
she
doubted
if
it
would
bring
a
blessing
and
on
the
sunday
morning
john
came
he
was
a
very
agreeable
gentlemanly
man
with
such
manners
as
you
do
see
in
littlington
no
nor
in
polegate
neither
and
very
changed
from
the
boy
with
the
red
cheeks
as
used
to
come
past
our
house
on
his
way
to
school
when
he
was
very
little
harry
met
him
at
the
station
and
brought
him
home
and
when
he
come
in
he
kissed
me
like
a
brother
and
mother
too
and
he
said
best
good
of
trouble
is
to
show
you
who
your
friends
really
are
says
mother
doubt
if
all
the
detectives
in
london
asking
your
pardon
master
john
can
set
master
harry
up
in
his
own
again
but
he
got
a
pair
of
hands
and
so
has
my
polly
and
he
might
have
chosen
worse
though
i
says
it
now
after
dinner
when
i
cleared
away
nothing
would
serve
but
i
must
go
out
with
the
two
of
them
so
we
went
out
and
walked
up
on
to
the
downs
for
quietness
sake
and
it
was
a
warm
day
and
soft
though
november
and
we
leaned
against
a
grey
gate
and
talked
it
all
over
then
says
master
john
here
polly
we
are
to
have
any
secrets
from
you
there
no
doubt
they
were
married
but
does
it
seem
to
you
rather
strange
that
my
poor
old
father
should
have
been
taken
off
so
suddenly
after
the
wedding
i
said
the
doctors
seemed
to
understand
all
about
it
then
he
said
something
about
the
doctors
that
it
was
just
as
well
they
were
there
to
hear
and
he
went
on
course
i
thought
at
first
they
were
married
so
i
set
about
finding
out
what
they
did
when
they
came
to
london
and
i
found
out
what
my
father
did
but
i
did
pounce
on
a
bit
of
news
and
that
that
she
was
with
him
the
whole
day
they
came
to
charing
cross
by
the
same
train
but
he
was
with
her
when
she
went
to
get
that
arsenic
from
the
chemist
says
i
says
john
you
get
excited
my
dear
i
found
that
out
by
a
piece
of
luck
once
as
does
come
to
a
man
every
day
of
the
week
a
woman
answering
to
her
description
went
into
a
shop
and
the
assistant
gave
the
arsenic
a
it
was
to
kill
rats
with
god
above
only
knows
why
they
put
such
bits
of
fools
into
a
shop
to
sell
of
death
over
the
counter
says
harry
the
question
is
was
this
woman
answering
to
her
description
really
blake
or
not
was
blake
says
i
very
short
and
sharp
do
you
know
says
john
shorter
and
sharper
then
i
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
and
pulled
out
what
i
had
found
in
blake
corner
cupboard
and
john
took
it
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
and
whistled
long
and
low
it
was
a
little
white
packet
and
had
been
opened
and
the
label
torn
across
but
you
could
read
what
was
on
it
plain
enough
poison
and
the
name
of
the
chemist
in
london
john
face
was
red
as
fire
like
some
men
is
when
they
going
in
fighting
and
my
harry
as
white
as
milk
as
some
other
men
is
at
such
times
but
as
for
me
i
fell
to
think
that
any
woman
could
be
so
wicked
and
him
such
a
good
master
and
so
kind
to
her
and
she
having
the
sole
care
of
him
helpless
in
her
hands
as
the
babe
and
harry
he
patted
me
on
the
back
and
told
me
to
cheer
up
and
not
to
cry
and
to
be
a
good
girl
and
presently
my
handkerchief
being
wet
through
i
stopped
and
then
john
he
said
bring
it
home
to
her
yet
harry
my
boy
i
get
an
order
to
have
poor
old
father
exhumed
and
the
doctors
shall
tell
us
how
much
of
the
arsenic
that
cursed
old
hag
gave
him
iv
i
do
know
what
you
have
to
do
to
get
an
order
to
open
up
a
grave
and
look
at
the
poor
dead
person
after
it
is
once
put
away
but
whatever
it
was
john
knew
and
did
it
we
did
tell
any
one
except
our
dear
old
parson
who
buried
the
old
man
and
he
listened
to
all
we
had
to
say
and
shook
his
head
and
said
think
you
are
wrong
i
think
you
are
wrong
but
that
was
only
natural
him
not
liking
to
see
his
good
work
disturbed
but
he
said
he
would
be
there
now
no
one
was
told
of
it
and
yet
it
seemed
as
if
every
one
for
miles
round
knew
more
than
we
did
about
it
afore
the
day
come
old
jezebel
up
at
the
farm
she
met
me
one
day
and
she
says
a
pretty
puss
are
you
howking
up
my
poor
dear
deceased
husband
remains
before
they
hardly
cold
much
good
you
do
yourself
you
end
in
the
workhouse
my
fine
miss
and
i
shall
come
to
see
you
as
a
lady
visitor
when
dying
i
tried
to
get
past
her
but
she
would
let
me
wish
you
joy
that
harry
cursed
young
brute
says
she
serves
him
right
it
does
to
marry
a
girl
out
of
the
gutter
and
with
that
i
could
help
it
i
fetched
her
a
smack
on
the
side
of
the
face
with
the
flat
of
my
hand
as
hard
as
i
could
and
bolted
off
her
after
me
and
me
being
young
and
she
stout
she
keep
up
with
me
gutter
indeed
and
my
father
a
respectable
labourer
and
known
far
and
wide
there
were
several
strangers
come
the
day
the
coffin
was
got
up
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
me
to
see
them
digging
not
to
make
a
grave
to
be
filled
up
but
to
empty
one
and
there
were
a
lot
of
people
there
i
did
know
and
the
parson
and
another
parson
seemingly
a
friend
of
his
and
every
one
as
could
get
near
looking
on
they
got
the
coffin
up
and
they
took
it
to
the
room
at
the
star
at
alfreston
where
inquests
are
held
and
the
doctors
were
there
and
we
were
all
shut
out
and
harry
and
john
and
i
stood
on
the
stairs
but
parson
being
a
friend
of
the
doctor
he
was
let
in
him
and
his
friend
and
we
heard
voices
and
the
squeak
of
the
screws
as
they
was
drawn
out
and
we
heard
the
coffin
lid
being
laid
down
and
then
there
was
a
hush
and
some
one
spoke
up
very
sharp
inside
and
we
could
hear
what
he
said
for
the
noise
and
confusion
that
came
from
every
one
speaking
at
once
and
nineteen
to
the
dozen
it
seemed
is
it
says
harry
trembling
like
a
leaf
my
god
what
is
it
if
they
do
open
the
door
afore
long
by
god
i
shall
burst
it
open
he
was
murdered
he
was
and
if
they
wait
much
longer
that
woman
will
have
time
to
get
away
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
and
parson
came
out
and
his
friend
with
him
are
the
young
men
says
our
parson
then
says
parson
number
two
a
good
thing
i
heard
of
this
and
came
down
out
of
mere
curiosity
i
am
ashamed
to
say
for
the
man
who
is
buried
there
is
not
the
man
whom
i
united
in
holy
matrimony
to
martha
blake
two
months
ago
last
tuesday
we
did
understand
the
poison
says
harry
may
have
poisoned
him
said
our
parson
i
do
think
it
but
from
what
my
friend
here
the
rector
of
st
mary
woolnoth
tells
me
it
is
quite
certain
she
never
married
him
she
no
right
to
anything
said
harry
what
about
the
will
says
i
but
no
one
harkened
to
me
and
then
harry
says
she
poisoned
him
she
will
be
off
by
now
parson
will
you
come
with
me
to
keep
my
hands
from
violence
and
my
tongue
from
and
slandering
for
i
must
go
home
and
see
if
that
woman
is
there
yet
and
parson
said
he
would
and
it
ended
in
us
all
five
of
us
going
up
together
the
new
parson
walking
by
me
and
talking
to
me
like
somebody
out
of
the
bible
as
it
might
be
one
of
the
disciples
i
got
to
know
him
well
afterwards
and
he
was
the
best
man
that
ever
trod
we
all
went
up
together
to
charleston
farm
and
in
through
the
back
without
knocking
and
so
to
the
parlour
door
we
knew
she
was
sitting
in
the
parlour
because
the
red
firelight
fell
out
through
the
window
and
made
a
bright
patch
that
we
see
before
we
see
the
house
itself
properly
and
we
went
as
i
say
quietly
in
through
the
back
and
in
the
kitchen
i
said
let
me
tell
her
for
what
she
said
to
me
and
i
was
sorry
the
minute
i
said
it
when
i
see
the
way
that
clergyman
from
london
looked
at
me
and
we
all
went
up
to
the
parlour
door
and
harry
opened
it
as
was
his
right
there
was
blake
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
she
had
got
on
her
widow
mourning
very
smart
and
complete
with
black
crape
and
her
white
cap
and
she
got
the
front
of
her
dress
folded
back
very
neat
on
her
lap
and
was
toasting
her
legs
in
her
checked
petticoat
and
her
feet
in
cashmere
very
warm
and
cosy
on
the
brass
fender
and
she
had
got
port
wine
and
sherry
wine
in
the
two
decanters
that
was
never
out
of
the
chiffonier
when
master
was
alive
and
there
was
something
else
in
a
black
bottle
and
opposite
her
in
the
best
that
old
master
had
sat
in
to
the
last
was
that
lawyer
sigglesfield
from
lewes
and
when
we
all
came
in
one
after
another
rather
slow
and
bringing
the
cold
air
with
us
they
sat
in
their
chairs
as
if
they
had
been
struck
and
looked
at
us
harry
and
john
was
in
front
as
was
right
and
in
the
dusk
they
could
hardly
see
who
was
behind
what
do
you
want
young
men
says
blake
standing
up
in
her
crape
and
her
white
cap
and
looking
very
handsome
harry
said
afterwards
though
for
my
part
i
never
could
see
it
and
as
she
stood
up
she
caught
sight
of
the
clergyman
from
london
and
she
shrank
back
into
her
chair
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
the
clergyman
stepped
into
the
room
none
of
us
having
the
least
idea
of
what
he
was
going
to
say
and
said
he
the
woman
that
i
married
on
the
and
that
the
man
i
married
her
to
said
he
pointing
to
sigglesfield
who
seemed
to
turn
twice
as
small
and
his
ferret
eyes
no
better
than
slits
said
our
parson
that
sigglesfield
the
solicitor
from
lewes
the
lady
opposite
is
sigglesfield
that
all
said
the
parson
from
london
i
want
to
know
says
harry
is
this
my
house
or
hers
it
plain
she
was
my
father
wife
but
yet
he
left
it
to
her
in
the
will
old
boy
said
john
does
it
how
could
he
have
left
anything
in
a
will
to
his
wife
when
he
had
got
any
wife
why
that
fellow
there
but
here
blake
got
on
her
feet
and
i
must
say
for
the
woman
if
she
had
got
anything
else
she
had
got
pluck
game
up
she
says
was
well
played
too
though
i
says
it
and
you
you
old
fool
she
says
to
the
parson
have
often
drunk
tea
with
me
and
gone
away
thinking
how
i
was
and
what
a
nice
woman
blake
was
and
how
well
she
knew
her
place
after
you
had
chatted
over
half
your
parish
with
me
i
know
you
are
the
curiousest
man
in
it
and
as
you
and
me
is
old
friends
i
do
mind
owning
up
just
to
please
you
it
save
a
lot
of
time
and
a
lot
of
money
my
duty
to
warn
you
said
john
anything
you
say
may
be
used
against
you
against
a
fiddlestick
end
said
blake
married
robert
sigglesfield
in
the
name
of
william
alderton
and
he
sitting
trembling
there
like
a
shrimp
half
boiled
he
got
ready
the
kind
of
will
we
wanted
instead
of
the
one
the
old
man
meant
and
gave
it
to
the
old
man
to
sign
and
he
signed
it
right
enough
what
about
that
arsenic
says
i
arsenic
i
found
in
your
corner
cupboard
it
was
you
took
it
was
it
you
little
silly
my
neck
too
handsome
for
me
to
do
anything
to
put
a
rope
round
it
do
you
suppose
i
kept
my
complexion
to
my
age
with
nothing
but
cold
water
you
little
cat
the
other
will
says
harry
my
father
meant
to
sign
get
you
that
says
blake
no
use
bearing
malice
now
all
said
and
done
and
she
goes
upstairs
to
get
it
and
if
you
believe
me
we
were
fools
enough
to
let
her
go
and
we
waited
like
lambs
for
her
to
come
back
which
being
a
woman
with
her
wits
about
her
and
no
fool
she
naturally
never
did
and
by
the
time
we
had
woke
up
to
our
seven
senses
she
was
far
enough
away
and
we
never
saw
her
again
we
did
try
too
much
but
we
had
the
law
of
that
sigglesfield
and
it
was
fourteen
years
penal
and
the
will
was
never
found
i
expect
blake
had
burnt
it
so
the
farm
came
to
john
and
what
else
there
was
to
harry
according
to
the
terms
of
the
will
the
old
man
had
made
when
his
wife
was
alive
afore
john
had
joined
the
force
and
harry
and
john
was
that
pleased
to
be
together
again
that
they
could
make
up
their
minds
to
part
so
they
farm
the
place
together
to
this
day
and
if
harry
has
prospered
and
john
too
it
no
more
than
they
deserve
and
a
blessing
on
brotherly
love
as
mother
says
and
if
my
dear
children
are
the
finest
anywhere
on
the
south
downs
that
by
the
blessing
of
god
too
i
suppose
and
it
does
become
me
to
say
so
acting
for
the
best
i
have
no
patience
with
people
who
talk
that
kind
of
nonsense
about
marrying
for
love
and
the
like
for
my
part
i
do
know
what
they
mean
and
i
do
believe
they
know
it
themselves
it
only
a
sort
of
fashion
of
talking
i
never
could
see
what
there
was
to
like
in
one
young
man
more
than
another
only
of
course
you
might
favour
some
more
than
others
if
they
was
better
to
do
my
cousin
mattie
was
different
she
must
set
up
to
be
in
love
and
walk
home
from
church
with
jack
halibut
sunday
after
sunday
the
long
way
round
if
you
please
through
the
meadows
and
he
used
to
buy
her
scent
and
ribbons
at
the
fair
and
send
her
a
big
valentine
of
lacepaper
and
satin
ribbons
and
things
though
lord
knows
where
he
got
the
money
from
honest
i
hope
for
he
had
a
penny
to
bless
himself
with
when
my
uncle
found
out
all
this
nonsense
being
a
man
of
proper
spirit
he
put
his
foot
down
and
says
he
my
girl
i
would
be
the
last
to
say
anything
against
any
young
man
you
fancied
especially
a
decent
chap
like
young
halibut
if
his
prospects
was
anything
like
as
good
as
could
be
expected
but
you
ca
pretend
poor
jack
are
him
being
but
a
blacksmith
man
and
not
in
regular
work
even
now
let
have
no
waterworks
he
went
on
for
mattie
had
got
the
corner
of
her
apron
up
and
her
mouth
screwed
down
at
the
corners
known
what
poverty
is
my
girl
and
you
sha
never
have
a
taste
of
it
with
my
consent
do
care
how
poor
i
be
father
said
mattie
jack
i
care
about
a
girl
all
over
says
uncle
for
he
was
a
sensible
man
in
those
days
bit
i
put
by
for
you
lass
it
enough
for
one
but
it
not
enough
for
two
and
when
young
halibut
can
show
as
much
you
shall
be
cried
in
church
the
very
next
sunday
but
meantime
there
must
be
no
kisses
no
more
letters
and
no
more
walking
home
from
churches
now
you
give
me
your
word
and
keep
it
i
know
you
will
like
an
honest
girl
so
mattie
she
gave
him
her
word
though
much
against
her
will
and
as
for
jack
i
suppose
he
did
care
much
about
staying
in
the
village
after
there
was
a
stop
put
to
his
philandering
and
kissing
and
scent
and
so
on
so
what
does
he
do
but
he
ups
and
offs
to
america
assisted
emigration
make
his
fortune
says
he
and
never
word
nor
sign
did
we
hear
of
him
for
three
blessed
years
mattie
was
getting
quite
an
old
maid
nigh
on
and
i
was
past
nineteen
when
one
morning
there
come
a
letter
from
jack
my
father
and
mother
were
dead
this
long
time
so
i
lived
with
uncle
and
mattie
at
the
farm
what
offers
i
had
had
is
neither
here
nor
there
at
any
rate
whatever
they
were
they
were
good
enough
but
mattie
might
have
been
married
twice
over
if
she
had
liked
and
to
folks
that
would
have
been
quite
a
catch
to
a
girl
like
her
getting
on
in
years
she
might
have
had
young
bath
for
one
the
strawberry
grower
and
what
if
he
did
drink
a
bit
of
a
saturday
he
was
taking
his
hundreds
of
pounds
to
the
bank
every
week
in
canvas
bags
as
all
the
world
knew
but
no
she
must
needs
hanker
after
jack
and
that
why
i
say
such
nonsense
well
when
the
letter
come
i
was
up
to
my
elbows
in
the
raspberry
and
currant
it
was
and
mattie
she
was
down
in
the
garden
getting
the
last
berries
off
the
canes
my
hands
were
stained
up
above
the
wrist
with
the
currant
juice
so
i
took
the
letter
up
by
the
corner
of
my
apron
and
i
went
down
the
garden
with
it
i
calls
out
a
letter
from
that
fellow
of
yours
she
could
see
me
and
she
thought
i
was
chaffing
her
about
him
which
i
often
did
to
keep
things
pleasant
tease
me
jane
she
says
i
do
feel
this
morning
as
if
i
could
hardly
bear
myself
as
it
is
and
as
she
said
it
i
came
out
through
the
canes
close
to
her
with
the
letter
in
my
hand
but
when
she
see
the
letter
she
dropped
the
basket
with
the
raspberries
in
it
they
rolled
all
about
on
the
ground
right
under
the
peony
bush
for
that
was
a
silly
garden
with
the
flowers
and
fruit
about
it
anyhow
and
i
had
a
nice
business
picking
them
up
and
she
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
kissed
me
and
cried
like
the
silly
little
thing
she
was
and
thanked
me
for
bringing
the
letter
just
as
if
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
or
any
wish
or
will
one
way
or
another
and
then
she
opened
the
letter
and
seemed
to
forget
all
about
me
while
she
read
it
i
remember
the
sun
was
so
bright
on
the
white
paper
that
i
could
scarce
see
to
read
it
over
her
shoulder
she
not
noticing
me
nor
anything
else
any
more
it
was
like
this
mattie
this
comes
hoping
to
find
you
well
as
it
leaves
me
at
present
do
bear
no
malice
over
what
your
father
said
and
done
but
not
coming
to
his
house
mattie
if
you
have
forgot
me
or
think
more
of
some
other
chap
do
let
anything
stand
in
the
way
of
your
letting
me
know
it
straight
and
plain
but
if
you
do
remember
how
we
used
to
walk
from
church
and
the
valentine
and
the
piece
of
poetry
about
dart
that
i
copied
for
you
out
of
the
you
will
come
and
meet
me
in
the
little
ash
copse
you
know
where
i
may
be
prevented
coming
for
i
a
lot
of
things
to
see
to
and
i
am
going
to
liverpool
on
thursday
and
if
we
are
to
be
married
you
will
have
to
come
to
me
there
for
my
business
wo
bear
being
left
and
i
must
get
back
to
it
but
if
so
i
will
put
a
note
in
your
in
the
church
so
you
had
best
look
in
there
on
your
way
up
on
wednesday
evening
am
taking
this
way
of
seeing
you
because
i
do
want
there
to
be
any
unpleasantness
for
you
if
you
are
tired
of
me
or
like
some
other
chap
better
mean
to
take
a
wife
back
with
me
mattie
for
i
have
done
well
and
can
afford
to
keep
one
in
better
style
than
ever
your
father
kept
his
will
you
be
her
dear
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
affectionate
friend
and
lover
jack
halibut
i
am
quicker
at
reading
writing
than
mattie
and
i
had
finished
the
letter
and
was
picking
up
the
raspberries
before
she
come
to
the
end
where
his
name
was
signed
with
all
the
little
crosses
round
it
says
i
as
she
folded
it
up
and
unbuttoned
two
buttons
of
her
dress
to
push
it
inside
says
i
the
best
news
come
home
again
she
says
and
i
give
you
my
word
she
did
look
like
a
rose
as
she
said
it
come
home
again
jane
and
it
all
right
and
he
likes
me
just
as
much
as
ever
he
did
god
bless
him
not
a
word
you
see
about
his
having
made
his
fortune
which
i
might
never
have
known
if
i
had
read
the
letter
which
i
did
acting
for
the
best
not
that
i
think
it
was
deceitfulness
in
the
girl
but
a
sort
of
fondness
that
always
kept
her
from
noticing
really
important
things
does
he
ask
you
to
have
him
says
i
course
he
does
she
says
never
thought
any
different
i
never
thought
but
what
he
would
come
back
for
me
just
as
he
said
he
would
just
as
he
has
by
that
i
knew
well
enough
that
she
had
often
had
her
doubts
well
says
i
well
that
ends
well
i
hope
he
made
enough
to
satisfy
uncle
that
all
yes
i
think
so
says
mattie
hardly
understanding
what
i
was
saying
did
notice
particular
but
i
suppose
that
all
right
she
did
notice
particular
now
i
put
it
to
you
was
that
the
sort
of
girl
to
be
the
wife
of
a
man
who
had
got
on
like
jack
had
i
for
one
did
think
so
if
she
did
care
for
money
why
should
she
have
it
when
there
was
plenty
that
did
and
if
love
in
a
cottage
was
what
she
wanted
and
kisses
and
foolishness
out
of
i
suppose
one
man
pretty
much
as
good
as
another
for
that
sort
of
thing
so
i
said
along
in
dear
and
we
will
get
along
with
the
and
talk
it
all
over
nicely
i
so
glad
he
come
back
i
always
say
he
would
if
you
remember
not
that
i
ever
had
but
she
did
seem
to
know
any
different
anyhow
the
next
few
days
mattie
was
like
a
different
girl
i
will
say
for
her
that
she
always
did
her
fair
share
of
the
work
but
she
did
it
with
a
face
as
long
as
a
fiddle
only
now
her
face
was
all
round
and
dimply
and
like
a
child
that
has
got
a
prize
at
school
on
wednesday
afternoon
she
said
to
me
going
to
meet
jack
and
do
you
say
a
word
to
the
others
about
it
jane
i
tell
father
myself
when
i
come
back
if
you
get
the
tea
like
a
good
girl
and
just
tell
them
i
gone
up
to
the
village
do
tell
lies
as
a
rule
especially
for
other
people
i
says
i
do
mind
doing
it
for
you
this
once
and
she
kissed
me
she
had
got
mighty
fond
of
kissing
these
last
few
days
and
ran
upstairs
to
get
ready
when
she
come
down
if
believe
me
she
was
in
her
best
dress
as
any
other
girl
would
have
been
but
she
had
gone
and
put
on
a
dowdy
old
green
and
white
delaine
that
had
been
her
sunday
dress
trimmed
with
green
satin
piping
three
years
before
and
the
old
hat
she
had
with
all
the
flowers
faded
and
the
ribbons
crumpled
up
that
was
three
year
old
too
and
the
very
one
she
used
to
walk
home
from
church
with
him
on
sundays
in
and
her
with
a
really
good
blue
poplin
laid
by
and
a
new
bonnet
with
red
roses
in
it
only
come
home
the
week
before
from
maidstone
she
come
through
the
kitchen
where
i
was
setting
the
tea
and
she
took
the
key
of
the
church
off
the
nail
in
the
wall
our
farm
was
full
a
mile
from
the
village
and
half
way
between
it
and
the
church
so
we
kept
one
key
and
jack
uncle
who
was
the
sexton
he
had
the
other
time
was
you
to
meet
jack
i
says
did
say
said
she
it
used
to
be
six
full
early
says
i
she
says
i
got
to
take
the
butter
down
to
weller
and
to
call
in
for
something
first
and
of
course
i
knew
that
she
meant
that
she
had
to
call
in
for
that
note
at
the
church
minute
she
was
out
of
the
way
i
runs
into
the
kitchen
and
says
to
our
maid
tibson
not
so
well
polly
i
going
over
to
see
her
give
the
men
their
tea
will
you
there
a
good
girl
and
she
said
she
would
and
in
ten
minutes
i
was
dressed
and
nicely
dressed
too
for
i
had
on
my
white
frock
and
the
things
i
had
had
at
a
girl
wedding
the
summer
before
and
a
pair
of
new
gloves
i
had
got
out
of
my
then
i
went
off
up
the
hill
to
the
church
after
mattie
even
then
not
making
up
my
mind
what
i
was
going
to
do
but
with
an
idea
that
all
things
somehow
might
work
together
for
good
to
me
if
i
only
had
the
sense
to
see
how
and
turn
things
that
way
as
i
come
up
to
the
church
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
her
old
green
gown
going
in
at
the
porch
and
when
i
come
up
the
key
was
in
the
door
and
she
had
come
out
quick
as
thought
the
idea
come
to
me
to
have
a
joke
with
her
and
lock
her
in
so
she
should
meet
him
and
next
minute
i
had
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
softly
and
stole
off
through
the
church
porch
and
up
to
the
ash
copse
which
i
could
make
a
mistake
about
for
there
only
one
within
a
mile
of
the
church
jack
was
there
though
it
was
before
the
time
i
could
see
his
blue
tie
and
white
shining
through
the
trees
when
i
locked
her
in
i
only
meant
to
have
a
sort
of
joke
at
least
i
think
so
but
when
i
come
close
up
to
him
and
saw
how
well
off
he
looked
and
the
diamond
ring
on
his
fingers
and
his
pin
and
his
gold
chain
i
thought
to
myself
you
go
to
liverpool
young
man
and
she
ai
got
your
address
and
likely
as
not
if
you
go
away
vexed
with
her
you
wo
leave
it
with
your
aunt
and
one
wife
is
as
good
as
another
if
not
better
and
as
for
her
caring
for
you
that
all
affectation
and
silliness
so
here
goes
he
stepped
forward
with
his
hands
held
out
to
me
but
when
he
saw
it
was
me
he
stopped
short
miss
jane
he
said
beg
your
pardon
i
was
expecting
quite
a
different
person
i
know
i
says
was
expecting
my
cousin
mattie
is
she
coming
he
asks
very
quick
looking
at
me
full
with
his
blue
eyes
hope
you
wo
take
it
hard
halibut
says
i
she
said
she
rather
not
come
it
says
he
see
i
went
on
a
long
time
since
you
was
at
home
and
you
not
writing
or
anything
and
some
girls
are
very
flighty
and
changeable
and
she
told
me
to
tell
you
she
was
sorry
if
you
were
mistaken
in
her
feelings
about
you
and
she
had
time
to
think
things
over
since
three
years
ago
and
now
you
so
well
off
she
says
she
sure
you
find
no
difficulty
in
getting
a
girl
suited
to
your
mind
she
say
that
he
said
looking
at
me
very
straight
not
like
her
do
mean
she
said
so
in
those
words
or
that
she
told
me
to
tell
you
so
but
that
what
i
made
out
to
be
her
mind
from
what
she
said
between
us
two
like
what
message
did
she
send
to
me
for
i
suppose
she
sent
you
to
meet
me
then
i
saw
that
i
should
have
to
be
very
careful
so
to
get
a
little
time
i
says
do
quite
like
to
tell
you
halibut
what
she
said
with
it
says
he
be
a
fool
girl
then
i
says
it
must
be
so
her
words
were
these
tell
jack
she
says
that
i
shall
ever
wish
him
well
for
the
sake
of
what
past
but
all
over
betwixt
him
and
me
and
what
says
he
was
much
besides
says
i
god
do
be
such
an
idiot
and
he
looked
as
if
he
could
have
shaken
me
then
if
you
must
have
it
says
i
says
tell
jack
there
at
least
one
girl
i
know
of
as
would
make
him
a
better
wife
than
i
should
and
has
been
thinking
of
him
steady
and
faithful
these
three
years
while
i
been
giving
my
mind
to
far
other
things
her
says
he
witch
and
who
is
this
other
girl
that
she
so
gracious
to
hand
me
over
to
do
want
to
say
no
more
says
i
going
now
halibut
for
well
i
knew
he
would
let
me
go
at
that
me
who
it
is
says
he
she
not
content
with
giving
me
the
mitten
herself
but
she
must
insult
me
and
this
poor
girl
too
who
got
more
sense
than
she
has
good
heavens
it
would
serve
her
right
if
i
took
her
at
her
word
and
took
the
other
girl
back
with
me
he
was
walking
up
and
down
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
frowning
like
a
july
thunderstorm
heartless
little
but
there
thank
god
all
women
like
her
who
this
girl
that
she
tried
to
set
me
against
ca
tell
you
says
i
ca
you
my
girl
but
you
shall
and
he
catches
hold
of
both
my
wrists
in
his
hands
me
go
i
cried
hurting
me
is
it
i
was
looking
down
my
nose
very
straight
but
when
he
said
that
i
just
lifted
my
eyes
up
and
looked
at
him
and
dropped
them
i
always
practised
looking
like
what
i
meant
or
what
i
wanted
people
to
think
i
meant
sort
of
matching
your
looks
and
words
like
you
match
ribbon
and
a
bit
of
stuff
you
the
girl
are
you
he
cries
she
thought
to
put
you
to
shame
before
me
with
her
messages
look
here
i
well
off
going
to
liverpool
and
back
to
america
next
week
i
want
to
take
a
wife
with
me
and
she
says
you
have
thought
of
me
while
i
been
away
will
you
marry
me
jane
i
just
looked
at
him
again
and
he
put
his
arm
round
me
and
gave
me
a
good
kiss
i
had
to
put
up
with
it
though
i
never
could
see
any
sense
in
that
sort
of
stuff
then
we
walked
home
together
very
slow
his
arm
round
me
i
daresay
some
people
will
think
i
ought
to
have
acted
so
taking
away
another
girl
fellow
but
i
was
quite
sure
she
would
get
plenty
that
would
play
love
in
a
cottage
with
her
and
she
did
not
seem
to
appreciate
her
blessings
in
getting
a
man
that
was
well
off
and
i
did
see
how
it
could
be
found
out
as
he
was
going
away
next
day
now
it
would
all
have
gone
as
well
as
well
if
i
had
had
the
sense
to
offer
to
see
him
off
at
the
station
and
i
ought
to
have
had
the
sense
to
see
him
well
out
of
the
place
but
we
all
make
mistakes
sometimes
mine
was
in
saying
to
him
at
the
corner
of
the
and
going
home
by
myself
leaving
him
with
of
an
hour
for
to
find
some
mischief
still
for
idle
hands
to
do
in
i
said
to
him
and
he
kissed
me
and
gave
me
the
address
where
to
write
and
told
me
what
to
do
i
sha
have
no
truck
with
your
uncle
says
he
marries
my
wife
and
i
takes
her
right
away
it
was
till
i
was
going
up
the
stairs
untying
my
as
i
went
and
smoothing
out
the
ribbons
with
my
finger
and
thumb
for
it
was
my
best
that
it
come
to
me
all
in
a
minute
that
i
had
left
mattie
locked
up
in
that
church
it
was
very
tiresome
and
how
to
get
her
out
i
did
know
but
i
thought
maybe
she
would
be
trying
some
of
the
other
doors
and
i
might
turn
the
key
gently
and
away
again
before
she
could
find
out
it
was
unlocked
so
up
to
the
church
i
went
very
hot
and
a
setting
sun
and
having
had
no
tea
or
anything
and
as
i
began
to
climb
the
hill
my
heart
stood
still
in
my
veins
for
i
heard
a
sound
from
the
church
as
i
never
expected
to
hear
at
that
time
of
the
day
and
week
lord
i
thought
tried
every
other
way
and
now
ringing
the
bell
and
she
fetch
up
the
whole
village
and
what
will
become
of
me
i
made
the
best
haste
i
could
but
i
could
see
more
than
one
black
dot
moving
up
the
hill
before
me
that
showed
me
folks
on
their
way
home
had
heard
the
bell
and
was
going
to
see
what
it
meant
and
when
i
got
up
there
they
were
trying
the
big
door
of
the
church
not
knowing
it
was
the
little
side
one
where
the
key
was
and
jack
he
come
up
almost
the
same
moment
i
did
and
i
knew
well
enough
he
had
come
to
get
that
note
out
of
her
for
fear
some
one
else
should
see
it
i
got
the
key
in
my
pocket
says
he
and
with
that
he
opened
the
door
the
bell
clang
clang
clanging
from
the
tower
all
the
time
like
as
if
the
bellringer
was
drunk
and
had
got
a
wager
on
to
get
more
beats
out
of
the
bell
in
half
an
hour
than
the
next
man
whoever
it
was
that
was
ringing
the
bell
and
i
could
give
a
pretty
good
guess
who
it
was
did
seem
to
hear
us
coming
and
they
went
up
the
aisle
and
pulled
back
the
red
baize
curtain
that
hides
the
bottom
of
the
tower
where
the
ringers
stand
on
sundays
and
there
was
mattie
with
her
old
green
gown
on
and
her
hair
all
loose
and
down
her
back
with
the
hard
work
of
bellringing
i
suppose
and
her
face
as
white
as
the
stag
as
is
painted
on
the
sign
down
at
the
inn
in
the
village
and
directly
she
saw
jack
i
knew
it
was
all
over
for
she
let
go
the
rope
and
it
swung
up
like
a
live
thing
over
our
heads
and
she
made
two
steps
to
jack
and
had
him
round
the
neck
before
them
all
jack
she
cried
look
like
that
i
came
to
fetch
your
letter
and
somebody
locked
me
in
jack
he
turned
to
me
and
his
face
was
so
that
i
should
have
been
afraid
to
have
been
along
of
him
in
a
lonely
place
is
your
doings
says
he
all
that
pack
of
lies
you
told
me
was
out
of
your
own
wicked
head
he
had
got
his
arm
round
her
and
was
holding
on
as
if
she
was
something
worth
having
instead
of
a
silly
girl
in
a
frock
three
year
old
do
know
what
you
mean
i
sure
i
said
was
only
a
joke
joke
says
he
i
call
it
and
i
know
they
lies
by
the
very
touch
of
her
in
my
arm
here
well
i
said
you
ca
take
joking
better
than
this
the
last
time
i
ever
try
joking
with
you
and
i
walked
out
of
the
church
and
the
other
folks
who
had
run
up
to
see
what
was
the
matter
come
out
with
me
and
they
two
was
left
alone
i
suppose
it
was
only
human
nature
that
as
i
come
round
the
church
i
should
get
on
the
top
of
a
tombstone
and
look
in
to
see
what
they
was
doing
it
was
the
little
window
where
a
pane
was
broken
by
a
stone
last
summer
and
so
i
heard
what
they
was
saying
he
was
trying
to
tell
her
what
i
had
told
him
quite
as
much
for
her
own
good
as
for
mine
as
you
have
seen
but
she
did
seem
to
want
to
listen
never
mind
all
that
now
jack
she
says
with
arms
round
his
neck
does
it
matter
about
a
silly
joke
now
that
i
have
got
you
and
it
all
right
betwixt
us
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
go
straight
home
and
tell
uncle
she
was
up
in
the
church
kissing
and
cuddling
with
jack
halibut
and
he
took
his
stick
and
started
off
after
her
but
he
met
them
at
the
garden
gate
and
jack
he
came
forward
and
he
says
kenworthy
i
have
had
hard
thoughts
of
you
this
three
year
but
i
see
you
was
right
for
if
i
had
never
gone
away
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
keep
my
little
girl
as
she
should
be
kept
and
as
i
can
now
thanks
be
and
i
should
never
have
known
how
dear
she
has
loved
me
this
three
year
and
uncle
like
the
old
thing
he
is
he
holds
out
his
hands
and
he
says
bless
you
my
boy
it
was
for
your
own
good
and
hers
and
they
went
in
to
supper
as
for
me
i
went
to
bed
i
had
had
all
the
supper
i
wanted
and
uncle
has
never
been
the
same
to
me
since
though
i
sure
i
tried
to
act
for
the
best
guilty
it
was
my
first
place
and
my
last
and
i
do
think
we
should
have
got
on
in
business
as
we
have
if
it
had
been
for
me
being
for
six
or
seven
years
with
one
of
the
first
families
in
the
county
though
only
a
housemaid
you
ca
help
learning
something
of
their
ways
at
any
rate
you
learn
what
gentlefolks
like
and
what
they
abide
but
the
worst
of
being
housemaid
where
there
a
lot
of
servants
kept
is
that
one
or
other
or
all
of
the
is
sure
to
be
wanting
to
keep
company
with
you
they
have
nothing
else
to
do
in
their
spare
time
and
i
suppose
it
handy
having
your
sweetheart
living
in
the
house
it
does
give
you
so
much
trouble
with
going
out
in
the
evening
if
not
fine
the
coachman
was
promised
to
the
cook
which
i
believe
often
takes
place
tim
the
head
groom
was
a
very
nice
genteel
fellow
and
i
daresay
i
might
have
taken
up
with
him
if
i
had
met
with
my
james
though
never
with
john
who
was
the
plague
of
my
life
to
begin
with
he
had
a
black
whisker
that
i
could
bear
to
look
at
let
alone
putting
one
face
against
it
as
i
should
have
had
to
have
done
when
married
no
doubt
and
he
had
a
roving
black
eye
very
yellowy
in
the
white
of
it
and
hair
that
looked
all
black
and
though
he
always
said
he
never
put
anything
on
it
except
a
little
bay
rum
in
moderation
they
tell
me
i
was
a
pretty
girl
enough
in
those
days
though
looks
is
less
important
than
you
might
think
to
a
housemaid
if
only
she
dresses
neat
and
has
a
small
waist
and
i
suppose
i
must
think
that
john
really
did
love
me
in
his
scowling
black
whiskery
way
he
was
a
good
footman
i
will
say
that
and
had
been
with
the
master
three
years
and
the
best
of
characters
but
whatever
he
might
have
thought
i
never
would
have
had
anything
to
do
with
him
even
if
james
and
me
had
had
seas
between
us
broad
for
ever
and
ever
amen
he
asked
me
once
and
he
asked
me
twice
and
it
was
and
again
and
i
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
think
that
perhaps
i
should
have
to
give
up
a
good
place
to
get
out
of
his
way
when
master
uncle
old
oliver
and
his
good
lady
came
to
stay
at
the
court
and
with
them
came
james
who
was
own
man
to
oliver
oliver
was
the
old
gent
i
ever
see
if
i
may
say
so
respectfully
he
was
as
bald
as
an
egg
with
a
sort
of
frill
of
brown
hair
going
from
ear
to
ear
behind
and
as
if
that
enough
he
was
shaved
as
clean
as
a
whistle
as
though
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
people
should
say
that
it
had
all
gone
to
beard
and
whiskers
anyway
he
wrote
books
a
great
many
of
them
and
you
may
often
see
his
name
in
the
papers
and
he
was
for
ever
poking
about
into
what
did
concern
him
and
my
lady
she
said
to
me
when
she
found
me
a
little
put
out
at
him
asking
about
how
things
went
on
in
the
servants
hall
she
said
to
me
must
mind
him
mary
she
said
know
he
likes
to
find
out
all
that
he
can
about
everything
so
as
to
put
it
in
his
books
and
he
certainly
talked
to
every
one
he
came
across
even
the
in
a
way
that
you
could
hardly
think
becoming
from
a
gentleman
to
servants
if
he
was
an
author
and
so
to
have
allowances
made
for
him
poor
man
he
talked
to
the
housemaids
and
he
talked
to
the
groom
and
he
talked
to
the
footman
that
waited
on
him
at
lunch
when
he
had
it
late
as
he
did
sometimes
owing
to
him
having
been
kept
past
the
proper
time
by
his
for
he
wrote
a
good
part
of
the
day
most
days
and
often
went
up
to
london
while
he
was
staying
with
us
to
sell
his
goods
i
suppose
he
wore
curious
clothes
not
like
most
gentlemen
but
all
wool
things
even
to
his
collars
and
his
boots
which
were
soft
and
soppy
like
felt
and
he
took
snuff
to
that
degree
i
would
have
believed
any
human
nose
could
have
borne
it
and
he
must
have
been
a
great
trial
to
oliver
until
she
got
used
to
him
and
his
pottering
about
all
over
the
house
in
his
shoes
and
the
mess
he
made
of
his
and
his
linen
oliver
was
a
round
little
fat
bunch
of
a
woman
if
i
may
say
so
in
speaking
of
master
own
aunt
by
marriage
and
him
a
baronet
she
had
the
most
lovely
jewellery
and
was
very
fond
of
wearing
it
of
an
evening
more
than
most
people
do
when
they
are
staying
with
relations
and
there
no
company
she
never
spoke
much
except
to
say
dick
dear
and
dick
dear
when
they
spoke
to
each
other
but
they
were
as
fond
of
each
other
as
pigeons
on
a
roof
and
always
very
and
nice
to
wait
on
as
for
james
he
was
the
jolliest
man
i
ever
met
and
cook
said
the
same
he
was
like
sam
weller
in
the
book
or
would
have
been
if
he
had
lived
in
those
times
but
footmen
are
more
genteel
now
than
they
were
then
anyway
he
had
been
at
the
court
hours
before
he
was
first
favourite
with
every
one
and
cook
made
him
a
welsh
rabbit
with
her
own
hands
he
had
been
able
to
get
his
dinner
comfortable
with
the
rest
of
us
a
thing
she
would
have
done
for
sir
william
himself
at
that
time
of
night
as
for
me
the
first
time
he
looked
at
me
with
his
jolly
blue
eyes
it
was
when
he
met
me
carrying
a
tray
the
first
morning
after
he
came
my
heart
gave
a
jump
inside
my
print
gown
and
i
said
to
it
as
i
went
downstairs
met
your
master
i
thinking
and
if
i
did
go
to
church
with
him
the
very
first
sunday
which
was
more
than
ever
i
had
done
with
any
of
the
others
it
was
after
he
had
asked
me
plain
and
straight
to
go
to
church
with
him
some
day
for
good
and
all
now
the
next
morning
quite
early
i
was
dusting
the
library
when
john
come
in
with
his
black
face
like
a
thundercloud
here
mary
he
says
do
you
mean
by
going
to
church
with
that
london
trumpery
your
own
business
says
i
sharp
as
you
please
am
he
says
are
my
business
the
only
business
i
care
a
damn
about
or
am
ever
likely
to
you
do
know
how
i
love
you
mary
he
says
and
i
was
sorry
for
him
as
he
spoke
would
lie
down
in
the
dirt
for
you
to
walk
on
if
it
would
do
you
any
good
so
long
as
you
did
walk
over
me
to
get
to
some
other
chap
am
very
sorry
for
you
john
says
i
i
told
you
not
once
or
twice
but
fifty
times
that
it
can
never
be
and
there
are
plenty
of
other
girls
that
would
be
only
too
glad
to
walk
out
with
a
young
man
like
you
without
your
troubling
yourself
about
me
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
like
a
cat
in
a
cage
presently
he
began
to
laugh
in
a
nasty
sly
disagreeable
way
you
think
he
marry
you
do
you
says
he
he
just
amusing
himself
with
you
till
he
gets
back
to
london
to
his
own
girl
you
let
him
see
you
was
only
amusing
yourself
with
him
and
you
come
out
with
me
when
you
get
your
evening
and
he
took
the
out
of
my
hand
and
caught
hold
of
my
wrists
all
a
lie
i
cried
i
wonder
you
can
look
me
in
the
face
and
tell
it
him
and
me
are
going
to
be
married
as
soon
as
he
has
saved
enough
for
a
little
public
and
i
never
want
to
speak
to
you
again
and
if
you
do
let
go
of
my
hands
i
scream
till
i
fetch
the
house
down
master
and
all
and
then
where
will
you
be
he
scowled
at
that
but
he
let
my
hands
go
directly
it
your
own
way
he
said
i
tell
you
you
wo
marry
him
and
you
find
he
wo
want
to
marry
you
and
you
marry
me
my
girl
and
when
you
have
married
me
you
shall
cry
your
eyes
out
for
every
word
you
have
said
now
shall
i
mr
liar
says
i
for
my
blood
was
up
that
happens
you
have
to
change
him
into
a
liar
and
me
into
a
fool
and
yourself
into
an
honest
man
and
you
find
that
the
hardest
of
all
and
with
that
i
threw
the
at
him
which
was
a
piece
of
wicked
temper
i
ought
to
have
given
way
to
and
ran
out
of
the
door
and
i
heard
him
cursing
to
himself
something
fearful
as
i
went
down
the
passage
thing
the
gentlefolks
are
abed
still
i
said
to
myself
and
i
did
tell
a
soul
about
it
even
cook
the
truth
being
i
was
ashamed
to
well
everything
went
on
pretty
much
the
same
as
usual
for
two
or
three
weeks
and
i
thought
john
was
getting
the
better
of
his
silliness
because
he
made
a
show
of
being
friendly
to
james
and
was
respectful
to
me
even
when
we
was
alone
then
came
that
dreadful
day
that
i
shall
never
forget
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
dinner
was
half
an
hour
later
than
usual
on
account
of
oliver
having
gone
up
to
town
on
his
business
but
he
did
get
home
when
expected
and
they
sat
down
without
him
after
all
i
was
about
my
work
turning
down
beds
and
so
forth
and
i
had
done
about
ten
minutes
and
was
in
my
lady
room
when
oliver
own
maid
came
running
in
with
a
face
like
paper
what
ever
shall
i
do
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
as
they
say
in
books
and
i
always
thought
it
nonsense
but
she
certainly
did
though
i
never
saw
any
one
do
it
before
or
since
is
it
i
asked
her
my
mistress
diamond
necklace
she
said
was
going
to
wear
it
and
then
she
said
no
she
would
she
have
the
emeralds
and
i
left
it
on
the
instead
of
locking
it
up
and
now
it
gone
i
went
into
oliver
room
with
her
and
there
was
the
with
the
pretty
shining
things
turned
out
on
the
for
oliver
had
a
heap
of
jewellery
that
had
come
to
her
from
her
own
people
and
she
as
fond
of
wearing
it
as
if
she
was
slim
and
twenty
instead
of
being
fifty
and
as
round
as
an
orange
we
looked
on
the
and
we
looked
on
the
floor
and
we
looked
in
the
curtains
to
see
if
it
had
got
in
any
of
them
but
look
high
look
low
no
diamond
necklace
could
we
find
so
at
last
scott
that
was
oliver
maid
said
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
and
tell
her
mistress
the
ladies
were
in
the
by
this
time
so
she
went
down
all
of
a
tremble
and
in
the
hall
there
was
oliver
looking
anxious
out
of
the
front
door
which
was
open
it
being
summer
and
the
house
standing
in
its
own
park
oliver
is
very
late
scott
she
says
am
getting
anxious
about
him
and
as
she
spoke
and
before
scott
could
answer
there
was
his
step
on
the
gravel
and
he
came
in
at
the
front
door
with
his
little
black
bag
in
his
hand
that
i
suppose
he
carried
his
stories
in
to
see
if
people
would
like
to
buy
them
scott
he
says
you
seen
a
ghost
and
indeed
she
looked
more
dead
than
alive
she
gulped
in
her
throat
but
she
could
not
speak
young
woman
says
oliver
to
me
have
lost
your
head
altogether
what
it
all
about
so
i
told
him
as
well
as
i
could
and
by
this
time
master
had
come
out
and
my
lady
and
you
never
saw
any
one
so
upset
as
they
were
all
the
house
was
turned
out
of
window
hunting
for
the
necklace
though
of
course
not
having
legs
it
could
have
walked
by
itself
out
of
oliver
room
all
the
servants
was
called
up
even
to
the
and
those
who
were
not
angry
were
frightened
and
what
with
fright
and
anger
there
was
one
of
us
i
do
believe
as
did
look
as
they
had
got
the
necklace
on
under
their
clothes
that
very
minute
john
was
very
angry
indeed
they
think
we
take
their
dirty
necklace
he
said
as
we
were
going
up
enough
to
ruin
all
of
us
this
kind
of
thing
happening
and
leaving
the
doors
open
so
that
any
one
could
get
in
and
walk
clear
off
with
it
without
a
stain
on
their
character
and
us
left
with
none
to
speak
of
so
when
master
had
asked
us
all
a
lot
of
questions
and
we
were
told
we
could
go
john
stepped
out
and
said
am
sure
i
am
only
expressing
the
feelings
of
my
when
i
say
that
we
should
wish
our
boxes
searched
and
our
rooms
so
that
there
shall
be
no
chance
for
any
one
to
say
afterwards
that
it
lays
at
any
of
our
doors
and
oliver
began
to
cry
and
she
said
no
she
would
put
that
insult
on
any
one
but
oliver
who
had
been
saying
much
though
so
talkative
generally
but
kept
taking
snuff
at
a
rate
that
was
dreadful
to
see
he
said
young
man
is
quite
right
my
dear
and
if
you
do
mind
he
says
to
master
think
it
had
better
be
done
and
so
it
was
done
and
i
do
know
how
to
write
about
it
now
though
it
was
never
true
they
came
to
my
room
and
they
looked
into
all
my
drawers
and
boxes
except
my
little
and
when
they
wanted
the
key
of
that
i
said
not
having
any
idea
that
they
could
think
that
i
could
do
such
a
thing
rather
you
did
look
into
that
it
only
some
things
i
do
want
any
one
to
see
and
the
reason
was
that
i
got
some
bits
of
things
in
it
that
got
the
week
before
in
the
town
towards
getting
my
things
for
the
wedding
ready
and
i
felt
somehow
i
did
want
any
one
to
see
them
till
james
did
and
they
all
looked
very
queer
at
me
when
i
said
that
and
my
lady
said
give
me
the
key
at
once
so
i
did
and
oh
i
shall
never
forget
it
they
took
out
the
flannel
and
the
longcloth
and
things
and
the
roll
of
embroidery
that
i
was
going
to
trim
them
with
and
rolled
inside
that
if
you
believe
me
there
was
the
necklace
like
a
shining
snake
coiled
up
i
never
said
a
word
being
struck
silly
i
did
cry
or
even
say
anything
as
people
do
in
books
when
these
things
happen
to
them
but
oliver
burst
out
crying
god
bless
her
for
it
and
my
lady
said
mary
i
never
have
believed
it
of
you
any
more
than
i
would
of
myself
and
oliver
he
said
to
master
all
the
servants
into
the
library
william
perhaps
some
one
else
is
in
it
too
but
nobody
said
a
word
to
say
that
it
was
me
and
indeed
how
could
they
i
should
think
it
like
being
had
up
for
murder
standing
there
in
the
library
with
all
the
servants
holding
off
from
me
as
if
i
had
got
something
catching
and
master
and
my
lady
and
and
oliver
in
leather
armchairs
all
of
a
row
looking
like
a
bench
of
magistrates
i
could
not
think
though
i
tried
hard
i
could
only
feel
as
if
i
was
drowning
and
fighting
for
breath
mary
says
master
have
you
got
to
say
never
touched
it
sir
i
said
never
put
it
there
i
know
who
did
and
may
god
forgive
them
for
i
never
could
then
my
lady
said
i
can
hardly
believe
it
of
you
even
now
but
why
would
you
let
us
have
the
key
of
your
box
then
i
turned
hot
and
cold
all
of
a
minute
and
i
looked
round
and
there
was
a
face
that
looked
kind
at
me
except
oliver
and
he
nodded
at
me
taking
snuff
all
over
his
fat
white
waistcoat
up
girl
he
said
up
so
then
i
said
to
be
married
my
lady
and
it
was
bits
of
things
i
got
towards
my
wedding
clothes
i
looked
at
james
to
see
if
he
believed
it
and
his
face
was
like
lead
and
his
eyes
wild
that
used
to
be
so
jolly
and
to
see
him
look
like
that
made
my
heart
stand
still
and
i
cried
out
my
god
strike
me
down
dead
for
live
i
ca
after
this
and
at
that
james
spoke
up
and
he
said
speaking
very
quick
and
steady
wish
to
confess
that
i
took
it
and
i
put
it
in
her
box
thinking
to
take
it
away
again
after
we
were
to
have
been
married
and
i
wanted
the
money
to
start
in
a
little
pub
and
everybody
stood
still
and
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
and
oliver
went
on
nodding
his
head
and
taking
snuff
till
i
could
have
killed
him
for
it
and
i
looked
at
james
and
i
could
have
fallen
at
his
feet
and
worshipped
him
for
i
saw
in
a
minute
why
he
said
it
he
believed
it
was
me
and
he
wanted
to
save
me
so
then
i
said
to
master
thing
was
found
in
my
box
sir
and
i
take
the
consequences
if
i
have
to
be
hanged
for
it
but
do
you
believe
a
word
james
says
he
never
touched
it
it
was
him
do
you
know
it
was
him
says
master
very
sharp
you
did
take
it
how
do
you
know
who
did
do
i
know
i
cried
forgetting
for
a
moment
who
i
was
speaking
to
if
you
half
a
grain
of
sense
among
the
lot
of
you
know
why
i
know
it
not
him
if
you
felt
to
a
young
man
like
i
feel
to
james
you
know
in
your
heart
that
he
could
not
have
done
such
a
thing
not
if
there
was
fifty
diamond
necklaces
found
in
fifty
pockets
on
him
at
the
same
time
they
said
nothing
but
oliver
chuckled
in
his
collar
till
have
liked
to
strangle
him
with
my
two
hands
round
his
fat
throat
and
i
went
on
as
sure
he
did
do
it
as
i
am
that
i
did
do
it
myself
and
as
he
would
have
been
that
i
did
if
he
had
really
loved
me
as
he
said
instead
of
believing
that
i
could
do
such
a
thing
and
trying
to
save
me
with
a
black
lie
god
bless
him
for
it
and
james
he
never
looked
at
me
but
he
said
again
mind
her
she
off
her
head
with
fright
about
me
you
send
me
off
to
prison
as
soon
as
you
like
sir
and
still
none
of
the
others
spoke
but
oliver
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
he
clapped
his
hands
softly
as
though
he
was
at
a
play
he
says
and
the
others
looked
at
him
as
if
they
thought
he
had
gone
out
of
his
mind
a
very
pretty
drama
very
nicely
played
but
now
it
time
to
put
an
end
to
it
do
you
want
to
see
the
villain
he
says
to
master
and
master
never
answering
him
only
staring
he
turned
quite
sharp
and
sudden
and
pointed
to
john
as
he
stood
near
the
door
with
his
black
eyes
burning
like
coals
took
it
said
oliver
you
put
it
in
mary
box
oh
you
need
start
i
know
it
true
without
that
john
had
started
but
he
pulled
himself
together
in
a
minute
the
man
had
pluck
i
will
say
that
he
spoke
quite
firm
and
respectful
why
should
i
have
done
that
sir
if
you
please
when
all
the
house
knows
that
i
have
been
courting
mary
fair
and
honest
this
two
year
oliver
tapped
his
and
grinned
all
over
his
big
smooth
face
you
do
your
courting
fair
and
honest
young
man
you
should
be
careful
not
to
do
it
in
the
library
with
the
window
open
i
was
in
the
verandah
and
i
heard
you
threaten
that
she
should
never
marry
james
and
that
she
should
marry
you
and
that
you
would
be
revenged
on
her
for
her
bad
taste
in
preferring
him
to
you
john
drew
a
deep
breath
nothing
sir
is
it
he
says
to
master
one
in
the
house
knows
i
have
been
sorry
for
a
hasty
word
and
have
been
the
best
friends
with
both
of
them
for
these
three
weeks
oliver
got
up
and
put
his
on
the
table
and
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
can
send
for
the
police
william
he
said
to
master
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
saw
the
gentleman
with
the
necklace
in
his
hand
i
did
get
home
late
but
not
so
late
as
you
thought
and
i
came
in
through
the
open
door
and
was
up
in
my
when
that
scoundrel
sneaked
into
my
wife
room
and
took
the
necklace
to
ruin
an
innocent
girl
with
what
a
thorough
scoundrel
you
are
though
are
you
he
said
to
john
then
john
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
much
as
to
say
all
up
now
and
he
said
to
oliver
very
politely
are
always
fond
of
poking
your
nose
into
other
people
business
sir
and
i
daresay
you
like
to
know
why
i
did
it
oh
yes
you
know
everything
you
do
says
john
growing
very
white
and
speaking
angry
and
quick
your
writing
and
your
snuff
and
your
gossiping
with
the
servants
which
no
gentleman
would
do
and
your
nasty
sneaking
boots
and
your
silly
old
tub
of
a
wife
i
knew
that
man
of
yours
would
believe
anything
against
her
and
i
knew
he
would
never
marry
her
after
a
like
this
and
i
knew
i
should
get
her
when
she
found
i
stuck
to
her
through
it
all
as
i
should
have
done
and
as
i
would
have
done
too
if
she
had
taken
fifty
diamond
necklaces
for
the
police
said
master
but
nobody
moved
for
oliver
who
had
been
crying
like
a
waterworks
ever
since
we
came
down
into
the
library
said
quite
sudden
dick
dear
let
him
go
do
prosecute
him
see
he
lost
everything
and
he
lost
her
and
he
must
have
been
mad
with
love
for
her
or
he
would
have
done
such
a
thing
now
was
that
a
true
lady
to
speak
up
like
that
for
him
after
what
he
said
of
her
oliver
looked
surprised
at
her
speaking
up
like
that
her
that
hardly
ever
said
a
word
except
dick
dear
and
dick
dear
and
then
he
shrugs
his
shoulders
and
he
says
are
right
my
dear
he
punished
enough
and
john
turned
to
go
like
a
dog
that
has
been
whipped
but
at
the
door
he
faced
round
and
he
said
to
oliver
a
good
woman
and
i
sorry
i
said
what
i
did
about
you
but
for
the
other
i
not
sorry
not
if
it
was
my
last
word
and
with
that
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
through
the
front
door
he
had
no
relations
and
he
had
no
friends
and
i
suppose
he
had
nowhere
to
go
with
his
character
gone
and
so
it
happened
that
was
truly
his
last
word
as
far
as
any
one
knows
for
he
was
found
next
morning
on
the
after
the
down
express
had
passed
you
never
saw
such
a
fuss
as
every
one
made
of
me
and
james
afterwards
i
might
have
been
a
queen
and
him
a
king
but
when
it
was
all
over
it
stuck
in
my
mind
that
he
ought
to
have
doubted
me
and
so
i
would
name
the
day
for
over
a
year
though
oliver
had
bought
him
a
nice
little
hotel
and
given
it
to
him
herself
but
when
the
year
was
up
and
oliver
came
down
to
stay
again
and
seeing
them
brought
it
all
back
and
his
having
tried
to
save
me
as
he
had
seemed
more
than
his
having
doubted
me
and
so
i
married
him
and
i
do
think
any
one
ever
made
a
better
match
james
says
he
made
a
better
match
and
if
i
do
agree
with
him
it
only
right
and
proper
that
he
should
think
so
and
i
thank
god
that
he
does
every
hour
of
my
life
son
and
heir
sir
jasper
was
always
the
best
of
masters
to
me
and
to
all
of
us
and
he
had
that
kind
of
way
with
him
masterful
and
gentle
at
the
same
time
like
as
if
he
was
kind
to
you
for
his
own
pleasure
and
ordering
you
about
for
your
own
good
that
i
believe
any
of
us
would
have
cut
our
hand
off
at
the
wrist
if
he
had
told
us
to
lady
breynton
had
been
dead
this
many
a
year
she
had
come
to
her
husband
with
her
hands
empty
they
say
that
sir
jasper
had
been
very
wild
in
his
youth
and
that
my
lady
money
had
come
in
very
handy
to
pull
the
old
place
together
again
she
worshipped
the
ground
sir
jasper
walked
on
as
most
women
did
that
he
ever
said
a
kind
word
to
but
it
never
seemed
to
me
that
he
took
to
her
as
much
as
you
might
have
expected
a
gentleman
like
him
to
do
but
he
took
to
her
baby
wonderful
i
was
nurse
to
that
baby
from
the
first
and
a
fine
handsome
little
chap
he
was
and
when
my
lady
died
he
was
wholly
given
over
to
my
care
and
i
loved
the
child
indeed
i
did
love
him
and
should
have
loved
him
to
the
end
but
for
one
thing
and
that
comes
in
its
own
place
in
my
story
but
even
those
who
loved
young
jasper
best
could
help
seeing
he
had
his
winning
ways
and
when
he
grew
up
to
man
estate
he
was
as
wild
as
his
father
had
been
before
him
but
his
wild
ways
were
the
ways
that
make
young
men
enemies
not
friends
and
out
of
all
that
came
to
the
house
for
the
hunting
or
the
shooting
or
what
not
i
used
to
think
there
was
one
would
have
held
out
a
hand
to
my
young
master
if
he
had
been
in
want
of
it
and
yet
i
loved
him
because
i
had
brought
him
up
and
i
never
had
a
child
of
my
own
i
never
wished
to
be
married
but
i
used
to
wish
that
little
jasper
had
been
my
own
child
i
could
have
had
an
authority
over
him
then
that
i
had
as
his
nurse
and
perhaps
it
might
have
all
turned
out
differently
there
were
many
tales
about
sir
jasper
but
i
did
think
it
was
my
place
to
listen
to
them
only
when
it
your
own
eyes
it
different
and
i
could
help
seeing
how
like
young
robert
the
was
to
the
family
he
had
their
black
curly
hair
and
merry
irish
eyes
and
he
if
you
please
had
just
sir
jasper
winning
ways
why
he
was
taken
on
as
gamekeeper
no
one
could
make
out
for
when
he
first
came
up
to
the
hall
to
ask
the
master
for
a
job
they
tell
me
he
knew
no
more
of
gamekeeping
than
i
do
of
latin
young
robert
was
a
steady
chap
and
used
to
read
and
write
of
an
evening
instead
of
spending
a
jolly
hour
or
two
at
the
dove
and
branch
as
most
young
fellows
do
and
as
indeed
my
young
master
did
too
often
and
sir
jasper
he
gave
him
books
without
end
and
good
advice
and
would
have
him
so
often
about
him
he
set
everybody
tongue
wagging
to
a
tune
more
merry
than
wise
and
young
robert
loved
the
master
of
course
who
did
well
there
came
a
day
when
the
lord
above
saw
fit
to
put
out
the
sunshine
like
as
if
it
had
been
a
bedroom
candle
for
sir
jasper
he
was
brought
back
from
the
with
his
back
broke
i
always
take
a
pleasure
in
remembering
that
i
was
with
him
to
the
last
and
did
everything
that
could
be
done
for
him
with
my
own
hands
he
lingered
two
days
and
then
he
died
it
was
the
hour
before
the
dawn
when
there
is
always
a
wind
no
matter
how
still
the
night
a
chilly
wind
that
seems
to
find
out
the
marrow
of
your
bones
and
if
you
are
nursing
sick
folk
you
bank
up
the
fire
high
and
watch
them
extra
careful
till
the
sun
gets
up
sir
jasper
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
oh
so
kindly
it
brings
tears
into
my
eyes
when
i
think
of
it
he
says
know
i
can
trust
you
and
i
said
sir
and
so
he
could
whatever
it
might
have
been
what
happened
afterwards
was
my
fault
and
could
have
been
guarded
against
go
he
said
my
old
secretaire
and
open
it
and
i
did
there
was
rows
of
inside
and
little
drawers
with
brass
knobs
take
hold
of
the
third
knob
from
the
right
nelly
said
he
pull
it
give
it
a
twist
round
i
did
and
lo
and
behold
a
little
drawer
jumped
out
at
me
from
quite
another
part
of
the
secretaire
see
what
in
it
nelly
says
he
it
was
a
green
leather
case
tied
round
with
a
bit
of
faded
ribbon
what
i
want
you
to
do
he
says
to
lay
that
beside
me
when
it
all
over
i
have
always
had
my
doubts
about
the
dead
sleeping
so
quiet
as
some
folks
say
but
i
think
i
shall
sleep
if
you
lay
that
beside
me
for
i
am
very
tired
nelly
he
said
tired
then
i
went
back
to
his
bed
where
he
lay
looking
quite
calm
and
comfortable
end
has
come
very
suddenly
says
he
it
is
best
this
way
then
we
was
both
quiet
a
bit
may
be
wrong
he
went
on
presently
his
face
quite
straight
but
a
laugh
in
his
blue
eye
may
be
wrong
nelly
but
i
think
you
would
like
to
kiss
me
before
i
die
i
know
well
enough
you
do
it
after
and
when
he
said
that
i
was
glad
i
had
never
kissed
another
man
and
soon
after
that
it
being
the
coldest
hour
of
all
the
night
he
moved
his
head
on
his
pillow
and
said
off
now
nelly
but
you
need
wake
the
doctors
it
very
dark
outside
hand
me
out
my
girl
hand
me
out
so
i
gave
him
my
hand
and
he
died
holding
it
whether
i
grieved
much
or
little
over
my
old
master
is
no
one
business
but
my
own
i
went
about
the
house
and
i
did
my
duty
ever
since
master
jasper
had
been
grown
up
i
had
been
housekeeper
i
did
my
duty
i
say
and
before
the
coffin
lid
was
screwed
down
i
laid
that
green
leather
case
under
the
shroud
by
my
master
side
and
just
as
i
had
done
it
i
turned
round
feeling
that
some
one
was
in
the
room
and
there
stood
young
master
jasper
at
the
door
looking
at
me
ready
now
i
said
to
the
undertaker
men
and
called
them
in
and
young
master
jasper
he
followed
me
along
the
passage
were
you
doing
was
putting
something
in
the
master
coffin
he
told
me
to
put
there
was
it
he
asked
very
sharp
and
sudden
should
i
know
says
i
in
a
case
it
may
be
some
old
letter
or
a
lock
of
hair
as
belonged
to
your
mother
into
my
room
he
said
and
i
followed
him
in
he
looked
very
pale
and
anxious
and
when
he
shut
the
door
he
spoke
here
nelly
i
going
to
trust
you
my
father
was
very
angry
with
me
about
some
little
follies
of
mine
and
he
told
me
the
other
night
he
had
left
a
good
slice
of
the
estate
away
from
me
do
you
think
that
packet
you
put
in
the
coffin
had
anything
to
do
with
it
lord
bless
your
soul
sir
no
i
said
was
no
will
or
lawyer
letters
it
was
but
some
little
token
of
remembrance
he
set
store
by
nelly
that
was
all
i
wanted
to
know
no
one
ever
knows
who
tells
these
things
but
it
had
leaked
out
somehow
that
that
slice
of
the
estate
was
to
belong
to
young
robert
the
gamekeeper
and
you
may
be
sure
the
tongues
went
wagging
above
a
bit
but
it
seemed
to
me
if
it
was
so
my
master
was
right
to
make
a
proper
provision
for
robert
as
well
as
for
jasper
however
nobody
could
be
sure
of
anything
until
after
the
funeral
the
doctor
was
staying
in
the
house
and
master
younger
brother
besides
the
lawyer
and
young
master
jasper
so
i
had
many
things
to
see
to
and
ought
to
have
been
tired
enough
to
get
to
sleep
easy
the
night
before
he
was
buried
but
somehow
i
could
sleep
i
help
thinking
of
my
master
as
i
had
known
him
all
these
years
him
being
always
so
gentle
and
so
kind
and
so
it
seem
likely
he
could
have
had
young
robert
on
his
conscience
all
the
time
and
yet
what
was
i
to
think
and
then
my
poor
jasper
i
say
but
i
never
loved
and
pitied
him
less
than
i
did
that
night
he
had
lost
such
a
father
and
he
could
go
troubling
about
whether
he
had
got
the
whole
estate
or
not
so
i
lay
awake
and
i
thought
of
the
coffin
lying
between
its
burning
tapers
in
the
great
bedroom
and
i
wished
they
had
not
screwed
him
down
for
then
i
could
have
gone
late
as
it
was
and
had
another
look
at
my
master
face
and
as
i
lay
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
heard
a
door
opened
and
then
a
step
and
then
a
key
turned
now
the
master
never
locked
his
door
so
the
key
of
that
room
turned
rusty
in
the
lock
and
before
i
had
time
to
think
more
than
that
i
was
out
of
bed
and
in
my
creeping
along
the
passage
sure
enough
my
door
was
open
as
i
saw
by
the
streak
of
light
across
the
corridor
i
walked
softly
on
my
bare
feet
and
no
one
could
have
heard
me
go
along
the
thick
carpet
when
i
got
to
the
door
i
saw
that
what
i
had
been
trying
not
to
think
of
was
really
true
master
jasper
was
there
taking
the
screws
out
of
his
father
coffin
to
see
what
was
in
that
green
leather
case
i
stood
there
and
looked
i
could
not
have
moved
not
for
the
queen
crown
if
it
had
been
offered
me
then
and
there
one
after
another
he
took
the
screws
out
and
laid
them
on
the
little
bedside
table
where
the
master
used
to
keep
his
pistols
of
a
night
when
all
the
screws
was
out
he
lifted
the
lid
in
both
his
arms
and
set
it
on
the
bed
where
it
lay
looking
like
another
coffin
then
he
began
to
search
for
what
i
had
put
in
beside
his
father
now
i
may
be
a
heartless
woman
and
i
suppose
i
am
or
how
account
for
it
but
when
i
saw
my
young
master
go
to
his
father
coffin
like
that
and
begin
to
serve
his
own
interest
and
his
own
curiosity
every
spark
of
love
i
had
ever
had
for
the
boy
died
out
and
i
cared
no
more
for
him
than
if
he
had
been
the
first
comer
if
he
had
kissed
his
father
or
so
much
as
looked
kindly
at
the
dead
face
in
the
coffin
it
would
have
been
different
but
he
had
a
look
or
a
thought
to
spare
for
him
as
gave
him
life
and
had
humoured
and
spoiled
and
petted
and
made
much
of
him
all
his
twenty
years
not
a
thought
for
his
father
all
his
thoughts
was
to
find
out
what
his
father
had
wished
him
to
know
now
i
was
feeling
set
that
master
jasper
should
never
know
what
was
in
that
green
leather
case
and
i
cared
no
more
for
what
he
thought
or
what
he
felt
than
i
should
have
done
if
he
had
been
a
common
thief
as
god
forgive
me
he
was
in
my
eyes
at
that
hour
so
i
crept
behind
him
softly
softly
an
inch
at
a
time
till
i
got
to
where
i
could
see
the
coffin
and
if
you
believe
a
foolish
old
woman
i
kept
looking
at
that
dead
face
till
i
nigh
forgot
what
i
was
there
for
and
while
i
was
standing
mazed
like
and
stupid
young
master
jasper
had
got
out
the
green
case
and
was
turning
over
what
was
in
it
in
his
hands
i
got
him
by
the
two
elbows
behind
and
he
started
like
a
horse
that
has
never
felt
even
the
whip
will
do
at
the
spur
touch
almost
at
the
same
time
my
heart
came
leaping
into
my
mouth
and
if
ever
a
woman
nearly
died
of
fright
i
was
that
woman
for
some
one
behind
me
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
said
all
this
young
sir
jasper
and
i
both
turned
sharp
it
was
the
doctor
his
ears
were
as
quick
as
mine
and
he
had
heard
the
key
too
i
suppose
anyhow
there
he
was
and
he
picked
up
the
papers
young
sir
jasper
had
let
fall
and
says
he
will
deal
with
these
young
gentleman
go
you
to
your
room
and
sir
jasper
like
a
kicked
hound
went
then
i
began
to
tell
my
share
in
that
night
work
but
the
doctor
stopped
me
for
he
had
seen
me
and
watched
me
all
along
then
he
stood
by
the
coffin
and
went
through
what
was
in
the
little
leather
case
must
keep
these
now
he
said
you
shall
keep
your
promise
and
put
them
beside
him
before
he
is
buried
and
the
next
day
before
the
funeral
i
went
alone
and
saw
my
master
again
and
gave
him
his
little
case
back
and
i
thought
i
should
have
liked
him
to
know
that
i
had
done
my
best
for
him
but
he
could
not
have
known
that
without
knowing
of
what
young
sir
jasper
had
done
and
that
would
have
broken
his
heart
so
when
all
said
and
done
perhaps
it
as
well
the
dead
know
nothing
and
after
the
funeral
we
was
all
in
the
library
to
hear
the
will
read
and
the
lawyer
he
read
out
that
the
personal
property
went
to
robert
the
gamekeeper
and
the
entailed
property
would
of
course
be
young
sir
jasper
and
young
sir
jasper
oh
that
ever
i
should
have
called
him
my
boy
he
rose
up
in
his
place
and
said
that
his
father
was
a
doting
old
fool
and
out
of
his
mind
and
he
would
have
the
law
of
them
anyhow
and
my
late
dear
master
not
yet
turned
of
fifty
and
then
the
doctor
got
up
and
he
said
a
bit
young
man
i
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
here
and
he
up
and
told
before
all
the
folks
there
straight
out
what
had
passed
last
night
and
how
young
sir
jasper
had
willed
to
rob
his
father
coffin
you
want
to
know
what
was
in
the
little
green
leather
case
he
says
at
the
end
it
was
this
a
lock
of
hair
and
a
wedding
ring
and
a
marriage
certificate
and
a
baptism
certificate
and
you
jasper
are
but
the
son
by
a
second
marriage
and
sir
robert
i
congratulate
you
for
you
are
come
to
your
own
i
get
nothing
then
shrieked
young
sir
jasper
trembling
like
a
woman
and
with
the
devil
looking
out
of
his
eyes
father
intended
you
to
have
the
entailed
estates
right
or
wrong
that
was
his
choice
but
you
chose
to
know
what
he
wished
to
hide
from
you
and
now
you
know
that
the
entailed
estates
belong
to
your
brother
the
personalty
forget
said
the
doctor
rubbing
his
hands
with
a
sour
smile
your
father
provided
for
that
in
the
will
to
which
you
so
much
objected
curse
his
memory
and
curse
you
cried
jasper
and
flung
out
of
the
house
nor
have
i
ever
seen
him
again
though
he
did
set
lawyer
folk
to
work
in
london
to
drive
sir
robert
out
of
his
own
place
but
to
no
purpose
and
sir
robert
he
lives
in
the
old
house
and
is
loved
as
his
father
was
before
him
by
all
he
says
a
kind
word
to
and
his
kind
words
are
many
and
to
me
he
is
all
that
i
used
to
wish
the
boy
jasper
might
be
and
he
has
a
reason
for
loving
me
which
jasper
never
had
for
he
said
to
me
when
he
first
spoke
to
me
after
his
funeral
mother
was
a
farmer
girl
he
said
your
father
was
a
farmer
so
i
feel
we
come
as
it
were
of
one
blood
and
besides
that
i
know
who
my
father
friends
were
i
never
forget
those
things
i
still
live
on
as
a
housekeeper
at
the
hall
my
master
left
me
no
money
but
he
bade
his
heir
keep
me
on
in
my
old
place
i
am
glad
to
think
that
he
did
not
choose
to
leave
me
money
but
instead
the
great
picture
of
himself
that
hung
in
the
hall
it
hangs
in
my
room
now
and
looks
down
on
me
as
i
write
one
way
of
love
you
do
believe
in
coincidences
which
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
god
or
them
that
do
for
that
matter
if
they
are
honestly
trying
to
do
what
they
think
right
now
i
do
i
had
as
good
a
time
as
most
young
fellows
when
i
was
young
my
father
farmed
a
bit
of
land
down
malling
way
and
i
walked
out
with
the
prettiest
girl
in
our
parts
jenny
was
her
name
jenny
teesdale
her
people
come
from
the
north
pretty
as
a
pink
jenny
was
and
neat
in
her
ways
and
would
make
me
a
good
wife
every
one
said
even
my
own
mother
and
when
a
man
mother
owns
that
about
a
girl
he
may
know
he
got
hold
of
a
treasure
now
jenny
her
name
was
jane
but
we
called
her
jenny
for
short
she
had
a
cousin
amelia
who
was
apprenticed
to
the
millinery
and
in
maidstone
the
two
had
been
brought
up
together
from
little
things
and
they
was
that
fond
of
each
other
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
them
together
i
was
fond
of
amelia
too
like
as
a
brother
might
be
and
when
jenny
and
me
walked
out
of
a
sunday
as
often
as
not
amelia
would
come
with
us
and
all
went
on
happy
enough
for
a
while
then
i
began
to
notice
jenny
did
seem
to
care
so
much
about
walking
out
and
one
sunday
afternoon
she
said
she
had
a
headache
and
would
rather
stay
at
home
by
the
fire
for
it
was
early
spring
and
the
days
chilly
amelia
and
me
took
a
turn
by
ourselves
and
when
we
got
back
to
farm
there
was
jenny
wonderfully
brisked
up
talking
and
laughing
away
with
young
wheeler
whose
father
keeps
the
i
was
not
best
pleased
i
can
tell
you
but
i
kept
a
still
tongue
in
my
head
only
as
time
went
on
i
could
help
seeing
jenny
seem
to
be
at
all
the
same
to
me
and
amelia
seemed
sad
too
i
was
in
the
hairdressing
then
and
serving
my
time
so
it
was
only
on
sundays
or
an
evening
that
i
could
get
out
but
at
last
i
said
to
myself
ca
go
on
us
three
that
used
to
be
so
jolly
as
flat
as
half
a
pint
of
four
ale
and
i
know
the
reason
why
says
i
i
hours
older
so
i
went
to
teesdale
with
that
clear
fixed
in
my
head
jenny
was
not
in
the
house
but
amelia
was
the
old
folks
had
gone
to
a
magic
lantern
in
the
schoolroom
and
amelia
was
alone
in
the
house
have
it
out
with
her
thinks
i
so
as
soon
as
we
had
passed
the
time
of
day
and
asked
after
each
other
relations
i
says
here
amelia
what
is
it
that
making
mischief
between
you
and
me
and
jenny
as
used
to
be
so
jolly
along
of
each
other
she
went
red
and
she
went
white
and
red
again
ask
me
tom
do
now
there
a
good
fellow
and
of
course
i
asked
her
all
the
more
then
says
she
never
forgive
me
if
i
tell
you
sha
never
know
says
i
and
i
swore
it
too
then
says
amelia
ca
abear
to
tell
you
tom
for
i
know
it
will
break
your
but
jenny
she
do
care
for
you
no
more
it
joe
wheeler
as
she
fancies
now
and
she
out
with
him
this
very
minute
as
here
we
stand
wring
her
neck
for
her
says
i
then
when
i
had
taken
time
to
think
a
bit
ca
believe
this
amelia
says
i
even
from
you
i
must
ask
jenny
that
just
what
you
swore
not
to
do
says
she
never
forgive
me
if
you
do
tom
and
what
need
of
asking
when
for
the
trouble
of
walking
the
length
of
the
road
you
can
see
them
together
but
if
i
tell
you
where
to
find
them
you
swear
you
speak
or
make
a
fuss
because
she
know
i
told
you
swear
i
wo
says
i
then
says
amelia
do
seem
to
be
acting
fair
to
her
but
take
it
the
other
way
i
ca
abear
to
stand
by
and
see
you
deceived
tom
if
you
go
by
the
churchyard
an
hour
from
now
see
them
in
the
porch
but
do
you
say
a
word
to
them
and
never
say
i
told
you
now
be
off
tom
says
she
it
was
early
summer
by
this
time
and
the
evenings
long
i
think
any
man
need
envy
me
what
i
felt
as
i
walked
about
the
lanes
waiting
till
it
was
time
to
walk
up
to
the
church
and
find
out
for
certain
that
i
been
made
a
fool
of
it
was
dusk
when
i
opened
the
churchyard
gate
and
walked
up
the
path
there
she
was
sure
enough
in
her
sunday
muslin
with
the
violet
sprig
and
her
black
silk
jacket
with
the
bugles
and
her
arm
was
round
joe
wheeler
neck
confound
him
and
his
arms
were
round
her
waist
both
of
them
they
did
see
me
and
i
stood
for
a
minute
and
looked
at
them
and
but
for
what
i
swore
to
amelia
i
believe
i
should
have
taken
wheeler
by
the
throat
and
shaken
the
life
out
of
him
then
and
there
but
i
had
swore
and
i
turned
sharp
and
walked
away
and
i
never
went
up
to
teesdale
nor
to
my
father
farm
but
i
went
straight
back
to
pound
the
man
i
was
bound
to
and
i
wrote
a
letter
to
jenny
and
one
to
amelia
and
in
amelia
i
only
said
amelia
thank
you
very
much
you
were
quite
right
tom
and
in
the
other
i
said
jenny
i
had
pretty
well
enough
of
you
you
can
go
to
the
devil
your
own
way
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
sincere
tom
i
going
for
a
soldier
and
i
left
everything
my
master
that
i
was
bound
to
and
my
trade
and
my
father
and
i
went
straight
off
to
london
and
i
should
have
been
a
soldier
right
enough
but
that
i
fell
in
with
a
fireman
and
he
persuaded
me
to
go
in
for
that
business
which
is
just
as
exciting
as
a
soldier
and
a
great
deal
more
dangerous
most
times
and
a
fireman
i
was
for
six
or
eight
years
but
i
never
cared
to
walk
out
with
another
girl
when
i
thought
of
jenny
i
did
tell
my
folks
where
i
gone
and
for
years
i
heard
nothing
from
them
and
one
night
there
was
a
fire
in
a
street
off
the
borough
a
high
house
it
was
and
i
went
up
the
ladder
to
a
window
where
there
was
a
woman
screaming
and
directly
i
see
her
face
i
see
it
was
jenny
i
fetched
her
down
the
ladder
right
enough
and
she
clung
round
my
neck
she
did
know
me
from
adam
and
said
go
back
and
fetch
my
husband
and
i
knew
it
was
wheeler
i
got
to
go
and
find
then
i
went
back
and
i
looked
for
wheeler
there
he
was
lying
on
the
bed
drunk
then
the
devil
says
to
me
call
have
you
to
go
and
find
him
the
drunken
swine
leave
him
be
and
you
can
marry
jenny
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
i
stood
there
half
a
minute
quite
still
with
the
smoke
getting
thick
round
me
then
the
next
thing
i
knew
there
was
a
cracking
under
my
feet
and
the
boards
giving
way
and
i
sprang
across
to
wheeler
all
in
a
minute
as
anxious
to
save
him
as
if
he
been
my
own
twin
brother
there
was
no
waking
him
it
was
lift
him
or
leave
him
and
somehow
or
other
i
got
him
out
but
that
minute
i
given
to
listening
to
satan
had
very
nearly
chucked
us
both
to
our
death
and
we
only
just
come
off
by
the
skin
of
our
teeth
the
crowd
cheered
like
mad
when
i
dragged
him
out
i
was
burned
awfully
bad
and
such
good
looks
as
i
had
burnt
off
me
and
i
did
know
nothing
plainly
for
many
a
long
day
and
when
i
come
to
myself
i
was
in
a
hospital
and
there
was
a
charity
sister
sitting
looking
at
me
and
by
the
lord
if
it
was
amelia
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
beside
me
and
she
says
i
must
tell
you
ever
since
i
found
religion
i
known
what
a
wicked
girl
i
was
o
tom
to
see
you
lying
there
so
ill
o
tom
forgive
me
or
i
shall
go
mad
i
know
i
shall
and
with
that
she
told
me
straight
out
holding
nothing
back
that
what
she
said
to
me
that
night
eight
years
ago
was
a
lie
no
better
and
that
who
i
seen
in
the
church
porch
with
young
wheeler
was
not
jenny
at
all
but
amelia
herself
dressed
in
jenny
things
forgive
me
tom
says
amelia
the
tears
runnin
over
her
dress
me
tom
for
i
can
never
forgive
myself
i
knew
jenny
did
rightly
care
about
you
tom
and
i
loved
you
so
dear
and
wheeler
wanted
jenny
and
so
i
was
tempted
to
play
off
that
trick
on
you
i
thought
you
would
come
round
to
me
after
i
was
weak
still
with
my
illness
but
i
put
my
hand
on
hers
and
i
says
do
forgive
you
amelia
for
after
all
you
done
it
for
love
of
me
and
are
you
a
nun
my
dear
says
i
says
she
only
on
liking
as
it
were
if
i
do
like
them
or
they
do
like
me
i
can
leave
any
minute
leave
for
god
sake
says
i
you
got
a
bit
of
love
for
me
left
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
marry
me
as
soon
as
i
come
out
of
this
for
it
worth
something
to
be
loved
as
you
loved
me
amelia
and
i
was
always
fond
of
you
says
she
marry
you
and
be
happy
after
all
the
harm
i
done
you
run
away
from
your
articles
and
turned
fireman
and
jenny
married
to
a
drunken
brute
no
tom
no
i
do
deserve
to
be
happy
but
if
you
forgive
me
i
sha
be
as
miserable
as
i
was
says
i
ever
you
think
better
of
it
let
me
know
and
the
curious
thing
is
that
within
two
years
she
did
think
better
of
it
for
why
that
fire
had
sobered
wheeler
more
than
twenty
thousand
temperance
tracts
and
all
the
sons
of
the
phoenix
and
bands
of
hope
rolled
into
one
he
never
touched
a
drop
of
drink
since
that
day
and
jenny
as
happy
as
her
kind
ever
is
i
hear
she
did
fret
over
me
more
than
a
month
though
perhaps
that
only
what
i
deserved
writing
to
her
as
i
did
and
then
amelia
she
said
such
harm
done
then
after
all
so
she
married
me
now
you
see
if
i
listened
to
satan
and
had
pulled
wheeler
out
i
should
have
got
burned
and
i
should
have
got
into
the
hospital
and
i
should
have
found
amelia
again
and
then
where
should
i
have
been
whereas
now
we
farming
the
same
bit
of
land
that
my
father
farmed
before
us
and
if
this
was
a
story
amelia
would
have
had
to
drowned
herself
or
something
and
i
should
have
gone
and
for
jenny
all
my
born
days
but
as
it
true
and
really
happened
amelia
and
me
have
been
punished
enough
i
think
for
eight
years
of
unhappiness
is
only
a
few
words
of
print
in
a
but
when
you
got
to
live
them
every
day
of
them
eight
years
is
eight
years
as
amelia
and
i
shall
remember
till
our
dying
day
and
eight
years
unhappiness
is
enough
punishment
for
most
of
the
wrong
things
a
man
can
do
or
a
woman
either
for
that
matter
coals
of
fire
all
my
life
i
lived
on
a
barge
my
father
he
worked
a
barge
from
london
to
tonbridge
and
was
on
a
barge
i
first
see
the
light
when
my
mother
time
come
i
used
to
wish
sometimes
as
i
could
lived
in
a
cottage
with
a
few
bits
of
flowers
in
the
front
but
i
think
if
i
been
put
to
it
i
should
have
chose
the
barge
rather
than
the
finest
cottage
ever
i
see
when
i
come
to
be
grown
up
and
took
a
husband
of
my
own
it
was
a
bargeman
i
took
of
course
he
was
a
good
sort
always
was
my
tom
though
not
particular
about
sundays
and
churchgoings
and
such
like
as
my
father
always
was
it
used
to
be
a
sorrow
to
me
in
my
young
married
days
to
think
as
tom
was
so
far
from
the
lord
and
i
used
to
pray
that
eyes
might
be
opened
and
that
might
be
led
to
know
the
truth
like
me
which
was
vanity
on
my
part
for
i
come
to
see
since
that
like
as
not
was
nearer
the
lord
nor
ever
i
was
we
worked
the
william
and
mary
did
tom
and
me
and
i
used
to
think
no
one
could
be
than
we
was
them
first
two
years
tom
was
as
kind
as
kind
and
never
said
a
hard
word
to
me
except
when
he
was
in
liquor
and
as
to
liftin
his
to
me
no
never
in
his
life
but
after
two
years
we
got
a
little
baby
of
our
own
and
then
i
knew
as
i
had
known
what
was
before
she
was
such
a
pretty
little
thing
with
yellow
hair
soft
and
fluffy
all
over
her
head
the
colour
of
a
duck
and
blue
eyes
and
dear
little
hands
that
i
used
to
kiss
a
thousand
times
a
day
my
mother
had
married
beneath
her
they
said
for
she
been
to
school
and
been
in
service
in
a
good
family
and
she
taught
me
to
read
and
write
and
cipher
in
the
old
days
when
i
was
a
little
kid
along
of
in
the
barge
so
we
named
our
little
kid
mary
to
be
like
our
boat
and
as
soon
as
she
was
big
enough
i
taught
all
my
mother
had
taught
me
and
when
she
was
about
eight
year
old
my
tom
james
who
was
a
tinsmith
by
trade
left
us
a
bit
of
money
over
l
it
were
a
penny
of
it
shall
i
spend
says
my
tom
when
he
heard
of
it
send
our
mary
to
school
with
that
we
will
and
happen
be
a
and
get
on
in
the
world
so
we
put
her
to
in
maidstone
and
it
was
like
tearing
the
heart
out
of
my
body
and
she
been
away
from
us
a
fortnight
and
the
barge
was
like
hell
without
her
tom
said
and
i
felt
it
too
though
i
could
say
it
being
a
christian
woman
and
one
night
we
got
the
barge
fast
till
morning
in
stoneham
lock
and
we
were
talking
about
her
you
fret
old
woman
says
tom
with
the
tears
standin
in
his
eyes
better
off
where
she
is
and
she
thank
us
for
it
some
day
she
where
she
is
says
she
would
be
in
this
dirty
old
barge
along
of
us
and
just
as
he
said
it
i
says
what
that
and
we
both
listened
and
if
it
was
that
precious
child
standing
on
the
bank
callin
and
she
run
all
the
way
from
maidstone
in
little
nightgown
and
a
waterproof
over
it
if
we
been
sensible
parents
we
should
smacked
and
put
back
next
day
but
as
it
was
we
hugged
and
we
hugged
each
other
till
we
was
all
out
o
breath
and
then
she
set
up
on
daddy
knee
and
a
bit
o
cold
pork
and
a
glass
of
ale
for
supper
along
of
us
and
there
was
no
more
talk
of
sendin
back
to
school
but
we
put
by
the
bit
of
money
to
set
up
if
she
should
marry
or
want
to
go
into
business
some
day
and
she
lived
with
us
on
the
barge
and
though
i
ses
it
there
a
sweeter
girl
nor
a
better
girl
atwixt
london
and
tonbridge
when
she
was
risin
seventeen
i
looked
for
the
young
men
to
be
comin
after
and
come
after
they
did
and
more
than
one
and
more
than
two
but
there
was
only
one
as
she
ever
give
so
much
as
a
kind
look
to
and
that
was
bill
jarvis
the
blacksmith
son
at
farleigh
whenever
our
barge
was
lyin
in
the
river
of
a
sunday
he
would
walk
down
in
best
in
the
afternoon
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
us
and
presently
it
got
to
our
mary
walking
out
with
regular
if
it
ai
going
to
be
william
and
mary
after
all
says
my
old
man
was
pleased
i
could
see
for
bill
jarvis
he
been
put
to
his

he
my

the
worse
for
if

the
reach
of
my
fisties
and
with
that
we
went
along
the
three
of
us
and
the
sun
kept
just
as
if
there
was
nothin
wrong
and
the
skylarks
up
in
the
blue
sky
till
i
would
to
wring
their
necks
for
them
and
we
to
go
on
up
and
down
the
river
as
usual
for
it
was
our
livin
you
see
and
we
could
get
away
from
the
place
where
everybody
knew
the
slight
that
had
been
put
upon
my
pretty
think
that
was
as
bad
as
might
be
but
it
was
the
worst
we
was
beginnin
june
then
and
by
the
end
of
august
i
knew
that
what
my
pretty
gone
through
at
the
church
was
nothin
to
what
she
got
to
go
through
her
face
got
pale
and
thin
and
she
fancy
food
i
suppose
i
ought
to
bin
angry
with
her
for
we
always
kept
ourselves
respectable
and
i
know
if
you
spare
the
rod
you
spoil
the
child
and
i
felt
i
ought
to
tell
her
i
did
with
such
wickedness
so
one
night
when
father
was
up
at
the
rose
and
crown
and
she
on
the
bank
with
elbows
on
knees
and
chin
in
i
says
to
ca
it
no
longer
my
girl
i
know
all
about
it
you
wicked
bad
girl
you
and
then
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
like
a
dog
does
when
you
it
mother
says
she
mother
and
with
that
i
forgot
everything
about
bein
angry
with
and
i
in
my
arms
in
a
minute
and
we
was
each
other
as
hard
as
hard
was
the
night
before
the
weddin
says
she
in
a
whisper
mother
i
did
think
there
was
any
harm
in
it
and

so
nearly

and
wife

i
for
she
was
cryin

times
over
but
father
says
she

me
when
knows
well
i
put
to
bed
and
i
made
a
cup
of
strong
tea
and
i
kissed
and
covered
up
with
my
heart
like
lead
and
nobody
as
ai
a
mother
can
know
what
a
of
misery
i
got
in
my
head
that
night
and
when
my
old
man

told
and

for
god

the
night
before
the
weddin

says
and
i
never
voice
so
soft
not
even
when
was

a
little
un
and

a
clatter
on
the
steps
near
where
she
slept
and
comes
out
in
a
minute
with
my
bible
in

afraid
of
my
bein

but
if
ever
i
meet
i
blood
if
i
swing
for
it
and
i
goin
to
swear
it
on
this
bible
so
help
me
god
he
looked
like
a
mad
thing
his
eyes
was
like
lanterns
and
face
all
pulled
out
of
its
proper
shape
and
plumps
down
on
knees
there
on
the
deck
with
the
bible
in
and
before
i
knew
what
i
was
doin
i
caught
the
book
out
of
and
chucked
it
into
the
river
my
own
bible
that
my
own
mother
had
given
me
when
i
was
a
little
kid
and
i
threw
my
arms
round
his
neck
and
held
his
head
against
my
bosom
so
that
his
mouth
was
shut
and
could
speak
no
no
tom
says
i
must
swear
it
and
you
sha
think
of
the
girl

of
your
poor
old
woman

of
the
poor
little

says
i
tryin
to
laugh
then
got
out
of
my
arms
and
stood
lookin
about
like
a
man
that
a
bad
dream
and
just
waked
up
then
smacks
me
on
the
back
right
old
woman
says

a
bad
day
for
him
when

and
we
got
through
the
winter
somehow
and
the
baby
was
born
as
fine
a
gell
as
ever
you
see
and
what
i
said
come
true
for
we
could
none
of
us
loved
the
baby
more
if
its
father
and
mother
been
married
by
an
archbishop
in
westminster
abbey
and
the
folks
we
knew
along
the
banks
would
have
been
kind
to
my
pretty
but
she
would
never
show
her
face
to
any
of
them
got
you
mother
and
i
got
father
and
the
baby
and
i
want
no
one

says
she
my
tom
he
was
never
the
same
man
after
that
night
got
out
the
bible
to
swear
he
give
up
the
drink
but
it
did
make
no
cheerfuller
and
went
to

now
and
then
a
thing

never
known

since
we
was

and
it
was

my
old
man
come
back
from

town
and
he
goes
down
to
the
bunk
where
bill
jarvis
is
lying
and
says

fair
the
man
doing

and
bill
looked
at

of
a
tremble
god
says
a
good
man
more
than
you
are
then
you
devil
says
tom
along
out
of
my
sight
says
i
think
better
of
it
and
that
soldier
was
off
that
barge
before
you
could
say
and
we
did
see
no
more
of
but
we
was
up
at
hamsted
lock
the
next
summer
the
baby
was
beginnin
to
toddle
about
now
we
called
her
bessie
for
me
she
and
her
mother
was
in
the
meadow
pickin
the
daisies
when
i
see
a
soldier
along
the
and
if
it
that
bill
jarvis
again
he
stopped
short
when
he
saw
my
pretty
mary
says
bill
says
she
that
my
kid
says
else
would
it
be
says
she
flashing
up
at
him
it
enough
to
deceive
a
girl
and
desert
her
without
throwing
mud
in
her
face
on
the
top
of
it
all
whose
else
should
the
child
be
but
yours
easy
says
bill
did
mean
that
my
girl
look
says
got
out
of
that
scrape
thanks
to
your
father
and
i
want
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
i
marry
you
if
you
like
and
be
a
father
to
the
kid
then
mary
she
stood
up
on
her
feet
with
the
little
one
in
arms
you
says
she
would
marry
you
if
you
was
the
only
man
in
the
world
me
marry
a
man
as
could
serve
a
girl
as
you
served
me
not
if
it
was
to
save
me
from
hanging
me
give
the
kid
a
father
like
you
thank
god
the
child
my
own
and
you
ca
touch
it
i
tell
you
says
she
and
all
i
rather
have
things
as
they
are
than
have
married
you
in
church
and
found
out
afterwards
what
a
cowardly
beast
you
are
and
with
that
she
walks
past
looking
like
a
queen
and
down
into
her
cabin
and
was
left
there
sucking
the
end
of
his
stick
and
looking
like
a
fool
think
perhaps
says
i
afterwards
ought
to
let
make
an
honest
woman
of
you
as
honest
as
i
want
to
be
says
she
the
child
is
all
my
own
now
so
no
more
was
said
and
things
went
on
the
same
old
sleepy
way
like
they
always
do
on
the
river
and
we
forgot
the
shame
almost
in
the
pleasure
of
having
the
little
thing
about
us
and
so
the
time
went
on
till
one
day
at
maidstone
a
sister
of
charity
with
one
of
those
white
caps
and
a
big
cross
round
her
neck
come
down
to
the
water
side
inquiring
for
tom
allbutt
me
says
my
old
man
a
young
man
ill
in
hospital
says
she
dying
afraid
and
he
wants
to
see
you
before
he
goes
it
typhoid
fever
but
that
over
now
he
dying
of
weakness
they
say
and
when
we
asked
the
young
man
name
of
course
it
was
bill
jarvis
so
we
left
my
pretty
in
charge
of
the
barge
and
my
old
man
and
me
we
went
up
to
the
hospital
bill
was
so
changed
you
would
known
from
being
a
fleshy
young
fellow
he
come
to
be
as
thin
as
a
skeleton
and
eyes
seemed
to
fill
half
face
want
to
marry
mary
says
dying
i
ca
do
her
and
the
kid
no
now
and
i
should
die
easier
if
she
marry
me
here
the
chaplain
would
do
it
he
said
so
my
old
man
did
say
nothin
but
says
i
would
dearly
like
her
to
be
made
an
honest
woman
of
me
that
wants
to
be
made
an
honest
man
of
says
bill
and
with
that
my
old
man
he
took
his
hand
and
shook
it
then
says
bill
with
the
tears
runnin
down
his
cheeks
partly
