the
facts
in
the
life
of
francis

are

than
his
fame
the
present
is
an
attempt
to
supply
this
deficiency
and
to
justify
by
the
array
of
authentic
particulars
the
high
position
which
has
been
assigned
him
among
the
in
our
revolutionary
history
the
task
has
been
a
difficult
but
i
trust
not
entirely
an
unsuccessful
one
our
southern
chronicles
are
meagre
and
unsatisfactory
south
carolina
was
too
long
in
the
occupation
of
the
british
too
long
subject
to
the
ravages
of
civil
and
foreign
war
to
have
preserved
many
of
those
minor
records
which
concern
only
the
renown
of
individuals
and
are
unnecessary
to
the
comprehension
of
great
events
and
the
vague
tributes
of
unquestioning
tradition
are
not
adequate
authorities
for
the
biographer
whose
laws
are
perhaps
even
more
strict
than
those
which
govern
the
historian
numerous
volumes
some
private
manuscripts
and
much
unpublished
correspondence
to
which
reference
has
been
more
particularly
made
in
the
appendix
have
been
consulted
in
the
preparation
of
this
narrative
the
various
histories
of
carolina
and
georgia
have
also
been
made
use
of
minor
facts
have
been
gathered
from
the
lips
of
living
witnesses
of
the
two
works
devoted
especially
to
our
subject
that
by
the
rev
weems
is
most
generally
known
a
delightful
book
for
the
young
the
author
seems
not
to
have
contemplated
any
less
credulous
readers
and
its
general
character
is
such
as
naturally
to
inspire
us
with
frequent
doubts
of
its
statements
weems
had
rather
loose
notions
of
the
privileges
of
the
biographer
though
in
reality
he
has
transgressed
much
less
in
his
life
of
marion
than
is
generally
supposed
but
the
untamed
and
sometimes
extravagant
exuberance
of
his
style
might
well
subject
his
narrative
to
suspicion
of
the
sketch
by
the
hon
judge
james
we
are
more
secure
though
as
a
literary
performance
it
is
quite
as
devoid
of
merit
as
pretension
besides
the
narrative
is
not
thorough
it
dwells
somewhat
too
minutely
upon
one
class
of
facts
to
the
neglect
or
the
exclusion
of
others
i
have
made
both
of
these
works
tributary
to
my
own
whenever
this
was
possible

the
life
of
francis
marion
chapter
introduction
the
huguenots
in
south
carolina
the
name
of
francis
marion
is
identified
in
the
history
of
south
carolina
his
parent
state
with
all
that
is
pleasing
and
exciting
in
romance
he
is
par
excellence
the
famous
partisan
of
that
region
while
sumter
stands
conspicuous
for
bold
daring
fearless
intrepidity
and
always
resolute
behavior
while
lee
takes
eminent
rank
as
a
gallant
captain
of
cavalry
the
eye
and
the
wing
of
the
southern
liberating
army
under
greene
marion
is
proverbially
the
great
master
of
strategy
the
wily
fox
of
the
swamps
never
to
be
caught
never
to
be
followed
yet
always
at
hand
with
unconjectured
promptness
at
the
moment
when
he
is
least
feared
and
is
least
to
be
expected
his
in
this
peculiar
and
most
difficult
of
all
kinds
of
warfare
is
not
to
be
disputed
in
his
native
region
he
has
no
competitor
and
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
compute
the
vast
influence
which
he
possessed
and
exercised
over
the
minds
and
feelings
of
the
people
of
carolina
simply
through
his
own
resources
at
a
period
most
adverse
to
their
fortunes
and
when
the
cause
of
their
liberties
everywhere
endangered
was
almost
everywhere
considered
hopeless
his
name
was
the
great
rallying
cry
of
the
yeoman
in
battle
the
word
that
promised
hope
that
cheered
the
desponding
patriot
that
startled
and
made
to
pause
in
his
career
of
recklessness
and
blood
the
cruel
and
sanguinary
tory
unprovided
with
the
means
of
warfare
no
less
than
of
comfort
wanting
equally
in
food
and
weapons
we
find
him
supplying
the
one
deficiency
with
a
cheerful
courage
that
never
failed
the
other
with
the
resources
of
a
genius
that
seemed
to
wish
for
nothing
from
without
with
a
force
constantly
fluctuating
and
feeble
in
consequence
of
the
most
ordinary
necessities
half
naked
men
feeding
upon
unsalted
pottage
forced
to
fight
the
enemy
by
day
and
look
after
their
little
families
concealed
in
swamp
or
thicket
by
night
he
still
contrived
one
knows
not
well
how
to
keep
alive
and
bright
the
sacred
fire
of
his
liberties
at
moments
when
they
seemed
to
have
no
other
champion
in
this
toil
and
watch
taken
cheerfully
and
with
spirits
that
never
appeared
to
lose
their
tone
and
elasticity
tradition
ascribes
to
him
a
series
of
achievements
which
if
they
were
small
in
comparison
with
the
great
performances
of
european
war
were
scarcely
less
important
and
which
if
they
sometimes
transcend
belief
must
yet
always
delight
the
imagination
his
adventures
have
given
a
rich
coloring
to
fable
and
have
stimulated
its
performances
the
language
of
song
and
story
has
been
employed
to
do
them
honor
and
our
children
are
taught
in
lessons
that
they
love
to
lisp
the
deeds
and
the
patriotism
of
his
band
marion
marion
brigade
and
marion
men
have
passed
into
household
words
which
the
young
utter
with
an
enthusiasm
much
more
confiding
than
that
which
they
yield
to
the
wondrous
performances
of
greece
and
ilium
they
recall
when
spoken
a
long
and
delightful
series
of
brilliant
exploits
wild
adventures
by
day
and
night
in
swamp
and
thicket
sudden
and
strange
manoeuvres
and
a
generous
unwavering
ardor
that
never
found
any
peril
too
hazardous
or
any
suffering
too
unendurable
the
theme
thus
invested
seems
to
have
escaped
the
ordinary
bounds
of
history
it
is
no
longer
within
the
province
of
the
historian
it
has
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
poet
and
seems
to
scorn
the
appeal
to
authentic
chronicles
when
we
look
for
the
record
we
find
but
little
authority
for
a
faith
so
confiding
and
seemingly
so
exaggerated
the
story
of
the
revolution
in
the
southern
colonies
has
been
badly
kept
documentary
proofs
are
few
bald
and
uninteresting
a
simple
paragraph
in
the
newspapers
those
newspapers
issued
not
unfrequently
in
cities
where
the
enemy
had
power
and
in
the
control
of
editors
unlike
the
present
who
were
seldom
able
to
expatiate
upon
the
achievement
which
they
recorded
or
the
brief
dispatches
of
the
captain
himself
whose
modesty
would
naturally
recoil
from
stating
more
than
the
simple
result
of
his
performances
these
are
usually
the
sum
total
of
our
authorities
the
country
sparsely
settled
and
frequently
overrun
by
the
barbarous
enemy
was
incapable
of
that
patient
industry
and
persevering
care
which
could
chronicle
the
passing
event
give
place
and
date
to
the
brilliant
sortie
the
gallant
struggle
the
individual
deed
of
audacity
which
by
a
stroke
and
at
a
moment
secures
an
undying
remembrance
in
the
bosoms
of
a
people
the
fame
of
marion
rests
very
much
upon
tradition
there
is
little
in
the
books
to
justify
the
strong
and
exciting
relish
with
which
the
name
is
spoken
and
remembered
throughout
the
country
he
was
not
a
bloody
warrior
his
battle
fields
were
never
sanguinary
his
ardor
was
never
of
a
kind
to
make
him
imprudent
he
was
not
distinguished
for
great
strength
of
arm
or
great
skill
in
his
weapon
we
have
no
proofs
that
he
was
ever
engaged
in
single
combat
yet
the
concurrent
testimony
of
all
who
have
written
declare
in
general
terms
his
great
services
and
the
very
exaggeration
of
the
popular
estimate
is
a
partial
proof
of
the
renown
for
which
it
speaks
in
this
respect
his
reputation
is
like
that
of
all
other
heroes
of
romantic
history
it
is
a
people
history
written
in
their
hearts
rather
than
in
their
books
which
their
books
could
not
write
which
would
lose
all
its
golden
glow
if
subjected
to
the
cold
details
of
the
phlegmatic
chronicles
the
tradition
however
swelling
still
testifies
to
that
large
merit
which
must
have
been
its
basis
by
reason
of
which
the
name
of
the
hero
was
selected
from
all
others
for
such
peculiar
honors
and
though
these
exaggerations
suggest
a
thousand
difficulties
in
the
way
of
sober
history
they
yet
serve
to
increase
the
desire
as
well
as
the
necessity
for
some
such
performance
the
family
of
marion
came
from
france
they
emigrated
to
south
carolina
somewhere
about
the
year
within
twenty
years
after
the
first
british
settlement
of
the
province
they
belonged
in
the
parent
country
to
that
sect
of
religious
dissenters
which
bore
the
name
of
huguenots
and
were
among
those
who
fled
from
the
cruel
persecutions
which
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
louis
followed
close
upon
the
of
the
jesuits
into
france
the
edict
of
nantz
which
had
been
issued
under
the
auspices
of
henri
and
by
which
the
huguenots
had
been
guaranteed
with
some
slight
qualifications
the
securities
of
the
citizen
almost
in
the
same
degree
with
the
catholic
inhabitants
had
under
the
weak
and
tyrannous
sway
of
the
former
monarch
proved
totally
inadequate
to
their
protection
long
before
its
formal
revocation
the
unmeasured
and
inhuman
persecutions
to
which
they
were
subjected
drove
thousands
of
them
into
voluntary
banishment
the
subsequent
decree
of
louis
by
which
even
the
nominal
securities
of
the
huguenots
were
withdrawn
increased
the
number
of
the
exiles
and
completed
the
sentence
of
separation
from
all
those
ties
which
bind
the
son
to
the
soil
the
neighboring
protestant
countries
received
the
fugitives
the
number
and
condition
of
whom
may
be
estimated
by
the
simple
fact
not
commonly
known
that
england
alone
possessed
eleven
regiments
composed
entirely
of
these
unhappy
refugees
besides
others
enrolled
among
the
troops
of
the
line
there
were
in
london
twenty
french
churches
supported
by
government
about
three
thousand
refugees
were
maintained
by
public
subscription
many
received
grants
from
the
crown
and
a
great
number
lived
by
their
own
industry
some
of
the
nobility
were
naturalized
and
obtained
high
rank
among
others
ruvigny
son
of
the
marquis
was

was
amply
rewarded
by
the
results
altogether
the
huguenots
were
a
much
better
sort
of
people
than
those
who
usually
constituted
the
mass
of
european
emigrants
the
very
desperation
of
their
circumstances
was
a
proof
of
their
virtues
they
were
a
people
of
principle
for
they
had
suffered
everything
for
conscience
sake
they
were
a
people
of
pure
habits
for
it
was
because
of
their
religion
that
they
suffered
banishment
in
little
patriarchal
groups
of
sixty
seventy
or
eighty
families
they
made
their
way
to
different
parts
of
america
and
with
the
conscious
poverty
of
their
own
members
were
generally
received
with
open
arms
by
those
whom
they
found
in
possession
of
the
soil
the
english
as
they
beheld
the
dependent
and
destitute
condition
of
the
fugitives
forgot
for
a
season
their
usual
national
animosities
and
assigning
ample
tracts
of
land
for
their
occupation
beheld
them
without
displeasure
settling
down
in
exclusive
colonies
in
which
they
sought
to
maintain
as
far
as
possible
the
pious
habits
and
customs
of
the
mother
country
one
of
these
communities
comprising
from
seventy
to
eighty
families
found
their
way
to
the
banks
of
the
santee
in
south
carolina
from
this
point
they
gradually
spread
themselves
out
so
as
to
embrace
in
partial
settlements
the
spacious
tract
of
country
stretching
to
the
winyah
on
the
one
hand
and
the
sources
of
cooper
river
on
the
other
extending
upward
into
the
interior
following
the
course
of
the
santee
nearly
to
the
point
where
it
loses
its
identity
in
receiving
the
descending
streams
of
the
wateree
and
congaree
these
settlers
were
generally
poor
they
had
been
despoiled
of
all
their
goods
by
the
persecutions
which
had
driven
them
into
exile
this
indeed
had
been
one
of
the
favorite
modes
by
which
this
result
had
been
effected
doubtless
also
it
had
been
among
the
subordinates
of
the
crown
one
of
the
chief
motives
of
the
persecution
it
was
a
frequent
promise
of
his
jesuit
advisers
to
the
vain
and
bigoted
louis
that
the
heretics
should
be
brought
into
the
fold
of
the
church
without
a
drop
of
bloodshed
and
until
the
formal
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantz
by
which
the
huguenots
were
put
without
the
pale
and
protection
of
the
laws
spoliation
was
one
of
the
means
with
others
by
which
to
avoid
this
necessity
these
alternatives
however
were
of
a
kind
not
greatly
to
lessen
the
cruelties
of
the
persecutor
or
the
sufferings
of
the
victim
it
does
not
fall
within
our
province
to
detail
them
it
is
enough
that
one
of
the
first
and
most
obvious
measures
by
which
to
keep
their
promise
to
the
king
was
to
dispossess
the
proscribed
subjects
of
their
worldly
goods
and
chattels
by
this
measure
a
object
was
secured
while
the
heretic
was
made
to
suffer
the
faithful
were
sure
of
their
reward
it
was
a
principle
faithfully
kept
in
view
and
the
refugees
brought
with
them
into
exile
little
beyond
the
liberties
and
the
virtues
for
which
they
had
endured
so
much
but
these
were
possessions
as
their
subsequent
history
has
shown
beyond
all
price
dalcho
in
his
church
history
says
upwards
of
one
hundred
families
our
humble
community
along
the
santee
had
suffered
the
worst
privations
of
their
times
and
people
but
beyond
the
necessity
of
hard
labor
they
had
little
to
deplore
at
the
outset
in
their
new
condition
they
had
been
schooled
sufficiently
by
misfortune
to
have
acquired
humility
they
observed
accordingly
in
their
new
relations
a
policy
equally
prudent
and
sagacious
more
flexible
in
their
habits
than
the
english
they
conciliated
the
latter
by
deference
and
soothing
the
unruly
passions
of
the
indians
the
santee
and
sewee
tribes
who
were
still
in
considerable
numbers
in
their
immediate
neighborhood
they
won
them
to
alliance
by
kindness
and
forbearance
from
the
latter
indeed
they
learned
their
best
lessons
for
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
that
upon
which
they
found
themselves
lay
in
the
unbroken
forest
the
high
lands
which
they
first
undertook
to
clear
as
less
stubborn
were
most
sterile
and
by
a
very
natural
mistake
our
frenchmen
adopted
the
modes
and
objects
of
european
culture
the
grains
the
fruits
and
the
vegetables
as
well
as
the
implements
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
the
indians
came
to
their
succor
taught
them
the
cultivation
of
maize
and
assisted
them
in
the
preparation
of
their
lands
in
return
for
lessons
thought
equally
valuable
by
the
savages
to
whom
they
taught
along
with
gentler
habits
and
morals
a
better
taste
for
music
and
the
dance
to
subdue
the
forest
of
itself
to
european
hands
implied
labors
not
unlike
those
of
hercules
but
the
refugees
though
a
gentle
race
were
men
of
soul
and
strength
capable
of
great
sacrifices
and
protracted
accommodating
themselves
with
a
patient
courage
to
the
necessities
before
them
they
cheerfully
undertook
and
accomplished
their
tasks
we
have
more
than
one
lively
picture
among
the
early
chroniclers
of
the
distress
and
hardship
which
they
were
compelled
to
encounter
at
the
first
but
in
this
particular
there
was
nothing
peculiar
in
their
situation
it
differed
in
no
respect
from
that
which
fell
to
the
lot
of
all
the
early
colonists
in
america
the
toil
of
felling
trees
over
whose
heavy
boughs
and
knotty
arms
the
winters
of
centuries
had
passed
the
constant
danger
from
noxious
reptiles
and
beasts
of
prey
which
coiled
in
the
bush
or
crouching
in
the
brake
lurked
day
and
night
in
waiting
for
the
incautious
victim
and
most
insidious
and
fatal
enemy
of
all
the
malaria
of
the
swamp
of
the
rank
and
affluent
soil
for
the
first
time
laid
open
to
the
sun
these
are
all
only
the
ordinary
evils
which
encountered
in
america
at
the
very
threshold
the
advances
of
european
civilisation
that
the
huguenots
should
meet
these
toils
and
dangers
with
the
sinews
and
the
hearts
of
men
was
to
be
expected
from
their
past
experience
and
history
they
had
endured
too
many
and
too
superior
evils
in
the
old
world
to
be
discouraged
by
or
to
shrink
from
any
of
those
which
hung
upon
their
progress
in
the
new
like
the
hardy
briton
whom
under
the
circumstances
we
may
readily
suppose
them
to
have
emulated
they
addressed
themselves
with
little
murmuring
to
the
tasks
before
them
we
have
at
the
hands
of
one
of
their
number
a
lady
born
and
raised
in
affluence
at
home
a
lively
and
touching
picture
of
the
sufferings
and
duties
which
in
carolina
at
that
period
neither
sex
nor
age
was
permitted
to
escape
after
our
arrival
she
writes
we
suffered
every
kind
of
evil
in
about
eighteen
months
our
elder
brother
unaccustomed
to
the
hard
labor
we
were
obliged
to
undergo
died
of
a
fever
since
leaving
france
we
had
experienced
every
kind
of
affliction
disease
pestilence
famine
poverty
and
hard
labor
i
have
been
for
six
months
together
without
tasting
bread
working
the
ground
like
a
slave
and
i
have
even
passed
three
or
four
years
without
always
having
it
when
i
wanted
it
i
should
never
have
done
were
i
to
attempt
to
detail
to
you
all
our
adventures
the
narrative
of
judith
manigault
wife
of
peter
manigault
as
quoted
by
hist
vol
for
a
graphic
detail
of
the
usual
difficulties
and
dangers
attending
the
escape
of
the
huguenots
from
france
at
the
period
of
migration
see
the
first
portion
of
this
we
may
safely
conclude
that
there
was
no
exaggeration
in
this
picture
the
lot
of
all
the
refugees
seems
to
have
been
very
equally
severe
men
and
women
old
and
young
strove
together
in
the
most
menial
and
laborious
occupations
but
as
courage
and
virtue
usually
go
hand
in
hand
with
industry
the
three
are
apt
to
triumph
together
such
was
the
history
in
the
case
of
the
carolina
huguenots
if
the
labor
and
the
suffering
were
great
the
fruits
were
prosperity
they
were
more
honors
distinction
a
goodly
name
and
the
love
of
those
around
them
have
blessed
their
posterity
many
of
whom
rank
with
the
noblest
citizens
that
were
ever
reared
in
america
in
a
few
years
after
their
first
settlement
their
forest
homes
were
crowned
with
a
degree
of
comfort
which
is
described
as
very
far
superior
to
that
in
the
usual
enjoyment
of
the
british
colonists
they
were
a
more
docile
and
tractable
race
not
so
restless
nor
though
this
may
seem
difficult
to
understand
to
those
who
consider
their
past
history
so
impatient
of
foreign
control
of
their
condition
in
carolina
we
have
a
brief
but
pleasing
picture
from
the
hands
of
john
lawson
then
of
the
province
of
north
carolina
this
gentleman
in
just
fifteen
years
after
its
settlement
made
a
progress
through
that
portion
of
the
huguenot
colony
which
lay
immediately
along
the
santee
the
passages
which
describe
his
approach
to
the
country
which
they
occupied
the
hospitable
reception
which
they
gave
him
the
comforts
they
enjoyed
the
gentleness
of
their
habits
the
simplicity
of
their
lives
and
their
solicitude
in
behalf
of
strangers
are
necessary
to
furnish
the
moral
of
those
fortunes
the
beginning
of
which
was
so
severe
and
perilous
there
are
says
he
about
seventy
families
seated
on
this
river
who
live
as
decently
and
happily
as
any
planters
in
these
southward
parts
of
america
the
french
being
a
temperate
industrious
people
some
of
them
bringing
very
little
of
effects
yet
by
their
endeavors
and
mutual
assistance
among
themselves
which
is
highly
to
be
commended
have
outstript
our
english
who
brought
with
them
larger
fortunes
though
as
it
seems
less
endeavor
to
manage
their
talent
to
the
best
advantage
is
admirable
to
see
what
time
and
industry
will
with
god
blessing
effect
c
we
lay
all
that
night
at
mons
eugee
huger
and
the
next
morning
set
out
farther
to
go
the
remainder
of
our
voyage
by
land
at
ten
we
passed
over
a
narrow
deep
swamp
having
left
the
three
indian
men
and
one
woman
that
had
piloted
the
canoe
from
ashley
river
having
hired
a
sewee
indian
a
tall
lusty
fellow
who
carried
a
pack
of
our
clothes
of
great
weight
notwithstanding
his
burden
we
had
much
ado
to
keep
pace
with
him
at
noon
we
came
up
with
several
french
plantations
meeting
with
several
creeks
by
the
way
the
french
were
very
officious
in
assisting
us
with
their
small
dories
to
pass
over
these
waters
whom
we
met
coming
from
their
church
being
all
of
them
very
clean
and
decent
in
their
apparel
their
houses
and
plantations
suitable
in
neatness
and
contrivance
they
are
all
of
the
same
opinion
with
the
church
of
geneva
there
being
no
difference
among
them
concerning
the
punctilios
of
their
christian
faith
which
union
hath
propagated
a
happy
and
delightful
concord
in
all
other
matters
throughout
the
whole
neighborhood
living
amongst
themselves
as
one
tribe
or
kindred
every
one
making
it
his
business
to
be
assistant
to
the
wants
of
his
countrymen
preserving
his
estate
and
reputation
with
the
same
exactness
and
concern
as
he
does
his
own
all
seeming
to
share
in
the
misfortunes
and
rejoice
at
the
advance
and
rise
of
their
brethren
lawson
fitly
concludes
his
account
of
the
settlers
upon
the
santee
by
describing
them
as
a
very
kind
loving
and
affable
people
a
character
which
it
has
been
the
happy
solicitude
of
their
descendants
to
maintain
to
the
present
day
lawson
journal
of
a
thousand
miles
travel
among
the
indians
from
south
to
north
carolina
is
a
work
equally
rare
and
interesting
this
unfortunate
man
fell
a
victim
to
his
official
duties
he
was
confounded
by
the
savages
with
the
government
which
he
represented
and
sacrificed
to
their
fury
under
the
charge
of
depriving
them
by
his
surveys
of
their
land
he
was
made
captive
with
the
baron

escaped
but
lawson
was

to
have
their

at
the
same
time
expressed
their
desire
of
being
united
to
the
church
of
england
whose
doctrines
and
discipline
they
professed
highly
to
esteem
the
assembly
passed
an
act

to
erect
the

a

the
exact
description
and
natural
history
of
that
country
and
a
journey
of
a
thousand
miles
travelled
through
several
nations
of
indians
by
john
lawson
of
north
carolina
london
a
more
delightful
picture
than
this
of
lawson
could
not
well
be
drawn
by
the
social
perfectionist
the
rational
beauty
of
the
voluntary
system
could
not
find
a
happier
illustration
and
duly
impressed
with
its
loveliness
we
shall
cease
to
wonder
at
the
instances
of
excellence
equally
frequent
and
admirable
which
rose
up
among
this
little
group
of
exiles
to
the
good
fortune
of
the
country
which
gave
them
shelter
and
in
attestation
of
their
own
virtues
but
this
happy
result
was
due
entirely
to
their
training
it
would
be
wonderful
indeed
if
such
an
education
toil
and
watch
patient
endurance
of
sickness
and
suffering
sustained
only
by
sympathy
with
one
another
and
a
humble
reliance
upon
divine
mercy
should
not
produce
many
perfect
characters
men
like
francis
marion
the
beautiful
symmetry
of
whose
moral
structure
leaves
us
nothing
to
regret
in
the
analysis
of
his
life
uncompromising
in
the
cause
of
truth
stern
in
the
prosecution
of
his
duties
hardy
and
fearless
as
the
soldier
he
was
yet
in
peace
equally
gentle
and
compassionate
pleased
to
be
merciful
glad
and
ready
to
forgive
sweetly
patient
of
mood
and
distinguished
throughout
by
such
prominent
virtues
that
while
always
sure
of
the
affections
of
followers
and
comrades
he
was
not
less
secure
in
the
unforced
confidence
of
his
enemies
among
whom
his
integrity
and
mercy
were
proverbial
by
their
fruits
indeed
shall
we
know
this
community
the
history
of
which
furnishes
as
fine
a
commentary
upon
the
benefit
of
good
social
training
for
the
young
example
and
precept
happily
keeping
concert
with
the
ordinary
necessities
and
performances
of
life
the
one
supported
by
the
manliest
courage
the
other
guided
by
the
noblest
principle
as
any
upon
record
it
is
one
of
the
qualifications
of
the
delight
which
an
historian
feels
while
engaged
in
the
details
of
those
grateful
episodes
which
frequently
reward
his
progress
through
musty
chronicles
to
find
himself
suddenly
arrested
in
his
narrative
by
some
of
those
rude
interruptions
by
which
violence
and
injustice
disfigure
so
frequently
in
the
march
of
history
the
beauty
of
its
portraits
one
of
these
occurs
to
us
in
this
connection
our
huguenot
settlers
on
the
santee
were
not
long
suffered
to
pursue
a
career
of
unbroken
prosperity
the
very
fact
that
they
prospered
that
in
the
language
of
lawson
they
outstript
our
english
when
placed
in
like
circumstances
that
they
were
no
longer
desolate
and
dependent
and
had
grown
vigorous
and
perhaps
wanton
in
the
smiles
of
fortune
was
quite
enough
to
in
the
bosoms
of
our
english
the
ancient
national
grudge
upon
which
they
had
so
often
fed
before
the
prejudices
and
hostilities
which
had
prevailed
for
centuries
between
their
respective
nations
constituted
no
small
part
of
the
moral
stock
which
the
latter
had
brought
with
them
into
the
wilderness
this
feeling
was
farther
heightened
at
least
maintained
by
the
fact
that
france
and
england
had
contrived
to
continue
their
old
warfare
in
the
new
world
and
while
french
emissaries
were
busy
in
the
back
parts
of
the
colony
stimulating
the
creeks
and
cherokees
to
hostility
it
was
perhaps
natural
enough
that
the
english
whose
frontiers
were
continually
ravaged
in
consequence
should
find
it
easy
to
confound
the
vous
their
enemies
with
those
their
neighbors
who
spoke
the
same
unpopular
language
it
is
not
improbable
on
the
other
hand
that
the
huguenot
settlers
were
a
little
too
exclusive
a
little
too
tenacious
of
their
peculiar
habits
manners
and
language
they
did
not
suffer
themselves
to
assimilate
with
their
neighbors
but
maintaining
the
policy
by
which
they
had
colonized
in
a
body
had
been
a
little
too
anxious
to
preserve
themselves
as
a
singular
and
separate
people
in
this
respect
they
were
not
unlike
the
english
puritans
in
whom
and
their
descendants
this
passion
for
homogeneousness
has
always
been
thought
a
sort
of
merit
appealing
very
much
to
their
and
pride
in
the
case
of
the
french
colonists
whether
the
fault
was
theirs
or
not
the
evil
results
of
being
or
making
themselves
a
separate
people
were
soon
perceptible
they
were
subjected
to
various
political
and
social
disabilities
and
so
odious
had
they
become
to
their
british
neighbors
that
john
archdale
one
of
the
proprietors
a
man
like
wm
penn
and
by
grahame
the
historian
pronounced
very
far
his
superior
equally
beloved
by
all
parties
as
a
man
just
and
fearless
was
when
governor
of
the
colony
compelled
to
deny
them
representation
in
the
colonial
assembly
under
penalty
of
making
invalid
all
his
attempts
at
proper
government
under
this
humiliating
disability
the
huguenots
lived
and
labored
for
a
considerable
period
until
the
propriety
of
their
lives
the
purity
of
their
virtues
and
their
fidelity
in
the
cause
of
the
country
forced
the
majority
to
be
just
an
act
passed
in
making
all
aliens
then
inhabitants
free
enabling
them
to
hold
lands
and
to
claim
the
same
as
heirs
according
liberty
of
conscience
to
all
christians
except
papists
placed
our
refugees
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
the
rest
of
the
inhabitants
and
put
an
end
to
the
old
hostilities
between
when
our
traveller
turned
his
back
upon
this
kind
loving
and
affable
people
to
pursue
his
journey
into
north
carolina
his
first
forward
step
was
into
a
howling
wilderness
the
santee
settlement
though
but
forty
miles
distant
from
charleston
was
a
frontier
all
beyond
was
waste
thicket
and
forest
filled
with
unknown
and
fearful
animals
and
sliding
reptiles
of
the
ground
startlingly
beautiful
which
the
footstep
of
man
dreaded
to
disturb
of
the
wild
beasts
by
which
it
was
tenanted
a
single
further
extract
from
the
journal
of
lawson
will
give
us
a
sufficient
and
striking
idea
he
has
left
the
santee
settlements
but
a
single
day
probably
not
more
than
fifteen
miles
his
indian
companion
has
made
for
his
supper
a
bountiful
provision
having
killed
three
fat
turkeys
in
the
space
of
half
an
hour
when
we
were
all
asleep
says
our
traveller
in
the
beginning
of
the
night
we
were
awakened
with
the
dismallest
and
most
hideous
noise
that
ever
pierced
my
ears
this
sudden
surprisal
incapacitated
us
of
guessing
what
this
threatening
noise
might
proceed
from
but
our
indian
pilot
who
knew
these
parts
very
well
acquainted
us
that
it
was
customary
to
hear
such
musick
along
that
there
being
endless
numbers
of
panthers
tygers
wolves
and
other
beasts
of
prey
which
take
this
swamp
for
their
abode
in
the
day
coming
in
whole
droves
to
hunt
the
deer
in
the
night
making
this
frightful
ditty
till
day
appears
then
all
is
still
as
in
other
places
page
less
noisy
except
in
battle
but
even
more
fearful
were
the
possessors
of
the
same
regions
the
savages
who
at
that
period
in
almost
countless
tribes
or
families
hovered
around
the
habitations
of
the
european
always
restless
commonly
treacherous
warring
or
preparing
for
war
the
red
men
required
of
the
white
borderer
the
vigilance
of
an
instinct
which
was
never
to
be
allowed
repose
this
furnished
an
additional
school
for
the
moral
and
physical
training
of
our
young
huguenots
in
this
school
without
question
the
swamp
and
forest
partisans
of
a
future
day
took
some
of
their
first
and
most
valuable
lessons
in
war
here
they
learned
to
be
watchful
and
circumspect
cool
in
danger
steady
in
advance
heedful
of
every
movement
of
the
foe
and
which
is
of
the
very
last
importance
in
such
a
country
and
in
such
a
warfare
as
it
indicates
happily
dextrous
in
emergencies
to
seize
upon
the
momentary
casualty
the
sudden
chance
to
convert
the
most
trivial
circumstance
the
most
ordinary
agent
into
a
means
of
extrication
or
offence
it
was
in
this
last
respect
particularly
in
being
quick
to
see
and
prompt
to
avail
themselves
of
the
happy
chance
or
instrument
that
the
partisans
of
the
revolution
in
the
southern
colonies
under
marion
and
others
asserted
their
vast
superiority
over
the
invader
and
maintained
their
ground
and
obtained
their
final
triumph
in
spite
of
every
inequality
of
arms
and
numbers
chapter
the
marion
family
birth
of
francis
marion
his
youth
shipwreck
we
have
dwelt
upon
the
huguenot
settlement
in
carolina
somewhat
more
largely
than
our
immediate
subject
would
seem
to
require
our
apology
must
be
found
in
the
obvious
importance
and
beauty
of
the
fact
could
this
be
shown
that
the
character
of
francis
marion
was
in
truth
a
remarkable
illustration
in
all
its
parts
of
the
moral
nature
which
prevailed
in
this
little
colony
of
exiles
that
from
the
harmony
existing
among
them
their
purity
of
conduct
propriety
of
sentiment
the
modesty
of
their
deportment
and
the
firmness
of
their
virtues
he
most
naturally
drew
all
the
components
of
his
own
his
hardihood
elasticity
great
courage
and
admirable
dexterity
in
war
were
also
the
natural
results
of
their
frontier
position
we
do
not
pretend
that
his
acquisitions
were
at
all
peculiar
to
himself
on
the
contrary
we
take
for
granted
that
every
distinguished
person
will
in
some
considerable
degree
betray
in
his
own
mind
and
conduct
the
most
striking
of
those
characteristics
which
mark
the
community
in
which
he
has
had
his
early
training
that
his
actions
will
in
great
measure
declare
what
sort
of
moral
qualities
have
been
set
before
his
eyes
not
so
much
by
his
immediate
family
as
by
the
society
at
large
in
which
he
lives
that
he
will
represent
that
society
rather
than
his
immediate
family
as
it
is
the
nature
of
superior
minds
to
rush
out
of
the
narrow
circles
of
domestic
life
and
that
his
whole
even
where
he
may
appear
in
the
garb
and
guise
of
the
reformer
will
indicate
in
numerous
vital
respects
the
tastes
and
temper
of
the
very
people
whose
alteration
and
improvement
he
seeks
the
memoir
upon
which
we
are
about
to
enter
will
we
apprehend
justify
the
preliminary
chapter
which
has
been
given
to
the
history
of
the
huguenots
upon
the
santee
gabriel
marion
the
grandfather
of
our
subject
was
one
of
those
who
left
france
in
his
son
named
after
himself
married
charlotte
cordes
by
whom
he
had
seven
children
five
of
whom
were
sons
and
two
daughters
francis
marion
was
the
last
he
was
born
at
winyah
near
georgetown
south
carolina
in
a
remarkable
year
as
in
a
sister
colony
we
are
not
able
to
say
how
nearly
at
the
same
time
it
gave
birth
to
george
washington
this
coincidence
which
otherwise
it
might
seem
impertinent
to
notice
here
derives
some
importance
from
the
fact
that
it
does
not
stand
alone
but
is
rendered
impressive
by
others
to
be
shown
as
we
proceed
not
to
speak
of
the
striking
moral
resemblances
which
it
will
be
no
disparagement
to
the
fame
of
the
great
virginian
to
trace
between
the
two
weems
speaks
of
six
children
only
naming
all
the
sons
and
one
of
the
daughters
of
her
he
frankly
says
i
have
never
heard
what
became
but
for
his
four
brothers
i
am
happy
to
state
that
though
not
formidable
as
soldiers
they
were
very
amiable
as
citizens
james
tells
us
of
two
daughters
not
naming
either
but
describing
them
as
grandmothers
of
the
families
of
the
mitchells
of
georgetown
and
of
the
dwights
formerly
of
the
same
place
but
now
of
stephen
parish
such
particularity
might
be
presumed
to
settle
the
the
infancy
of
marion
was
unpromising
at
birth
he
was
puny
and
diminutive
in
a
remarkable
degree
weems
in
his
peculiar
fashion
writes
i
have
it
from
good
authority
that
this
great
soldier
at
his
birth
was
not
larger
than
a
new
england
lobster
and
might
easily
enough
have
been
put
into
a
quart
pot
it
was
certainly
as
little
supposed
that
he
should
ever
live
to
manhood
as
that
he
should
then
become
a
hero
but
by
the
time
that
he
had
reached
his
twelfth
year
his
constitution
underwent
a
change
his
health
became
good
the
bracing
exercises
and
hardy
employments
of
country
life
invigorated
his
frame
and
with
this
improvement
brought
with
it
a
rare
increase
of
energy
he
grew
restless
and
impatient
the
tendency
of
his
mind
which
was
so
largely
developed
in
the
partisan
exercises
of
after
years
now
began
to
exhibit
itself
under
this
impulse
he
conceived
a
dislike
to
the
staid
and
monotonous
habits
of
rural
life
and
resolved
upon
seafaring
as
a
vocation
such
it
may
be
remarked
was
also
the
early
passion
of
washington
a
passion
rather
uncommon
in
the
history
of
a
southern
farmer
boy
in
the
case
of
washington
the
desire
was
only
overcome
at
the
solicitations
of
his
mother
the
mother
of
marion
in
like
manner
strove
to
dissuade
her
son
from
this
early
inclination
she
did
not
succeed
however
and
when
scarcely
sixteen
he
embarked
in
a
small
vessel
for
the
west
indies
the
particulars
of
this
voyage
with
the
exception
of
the
mode
in
which
it
terminated
have
eluded
our
inquiry
we
have
looked
for
the
details
in
vain
the
name
of
the
vessel
the
captain
the
port
she
sailed
from
have
equally
escaped
our
search
to
the
wanton
destruction
of
private
and
public
records
by
the
british
together
with
the
heedless
improvidence
of
heads
of
families
in
the
south
we
owe
this
poverty
of
historical
resource
the
voyage
must
have
been
taken
somewhere
about
the
year
at
that
period
there
were
perils
of
the
sea
to
which
the
mariner
is
not
often
exposed
at
the
present
day
the
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
particular
were
covered
with
pirates
the
rich
produce
of
new
spain
the
west
indies
and
the
southern
colonies
of
the
english
were
rare
temptations
the
privateers
of
spain
and
france
a
sort
of
legalized
pirates
hung
about
the
ports
of
carolina
frequently
subjecting
them
to
a
condition
of
blockade
and
sometimes
to
forced
contributions
in
the
occasional
absence
of
the
british
armed
vessels
appointed
for
the
protection
of
these
ports
the
more
enterprising
and
spirited
among
their
citizens
frequently
fitted
out
their
own
cruisers
drawing
them
for
this
purpose
from
the
merchant
service
manning
them
in
person
and
requiting
themselves
for
their
losses
of
merchandise
by
the
occasional
capture
of
some
richly
laden
galleon
from
new
spain
no
doubt
the
imagination
of
young
marion
was
fired
by
hearing
of
these
exploits
the
sensation
produced
in
the
community
by
the
injuries
done
to
its
commerce
in
all
probability
gave
the
direction
to
his
already
excited
and
restless
disposition
it
does
not
appear
however
that
first
and
only
voyage
was
made
in
an
armed
vessel
such
we
may
well
suppose
would
have
been
his
desire
but
the
period
when
he
set
forth
to
procure
service
upon
the
seas
may
not
have
been
auspicious
he
may
have
reached
the
seaport
a
moment
too
soon
or
too
late
and
the
opportunities
of
this
kind
were
necessarily
infrequent
in
a
small
and
frontier
city
whose
commerce
lay
mostly
in
the
hands
of
strangers
his
small
size
and
puny
appearance
must
have
operated
very
much
against
his
hopes
of
obtaining
employment
in
a
service
which
particularly
calls
for
manhood
and
muscle
in
what
capacity
or
in
what
sort
of
vessel
he
obtained
a
berth
we
are
left
wholly
to
conjecture
choosing
the
sea
as
a
vocation
and
laudably
resolved
on
acquiring
a
proper
knowledge
of
his
business
as
from
what
we
know
of
his
character
we
may
suppose
was
the
case
he
most
probably
went
before
the
mast
his
first
and
only
voyage
was
unfortunate
the
ship
in
which
he
sailed
was
no
doubt
equally
frail
and
small
she
foundered
at
sea
whether
going
or
returning
is
not
said
in
consequence
we
are
told
of
injuries
received
from
the
stroke
of
a
whale
of
the
thornback
species
so
suddenly
did
she
sink
that
her
crew
only
six
in
number
had
barely
time
to
save
themselves
they
escaped
to
the
jolly
boat
saving
nothing
but
their
lives
they
took
with
them
neither
water
nor
provisions
and
for
six
days
hopeless
of
succor
they
lay
tossing
to
and
fro
upon
the
bald
and
cheerless
ocean
a
dog
which
swam
to
them
from
the
sinking
vessel
was
sacrificed
to
their
hunger
his
raw
flesh
was
their
only
food
his
blood
their
only
drink
during
this
distressing
period
two
of
their
number
perished
miserably
the
survivors
on
the
seventh
day
were
found
and
taken
up
by
a
passing
vessel
nourished
carefully
and
finally
restored
to
their
homes
weems
represents
the
captain
and
mate
as
throwing
themselves
overboard
in
a
state
of
phrenzy
and
there
is
nothing
improbable
or
unnatural
in
the
statement
privation
of
food
the
use
of
salt
water
and
exposure
in
an
open
boat
to
a
burning
sun
might
very
well
produce
such
an
effect
the
only
difficulty
however
consists
in
the
simple
fact
that
we
have
no
other
authority
for
the
statement
james
is
silent
on
the
point
and
contents
himself
with
simply
stating
the
death
of
two
of
the
crew
weems
however
adds
that
of
two
others
whose
end
receives
as
usual
quite
a
dramatic
finish
at
his
hands
he
suffers
none
to
live
but
little
marion
and
in
the
exuberance
of
his
imagination
actually
goes
so
far
as
to
describe
the
particular
food
chocolate
and
turtle
broth
by
which
the
youthful
hero
is
recruited
and
recovered
by
this
he
designs
to
show
more
emphatically
the
immediate
interposition
in
his
behalf
of
an
especial
providence
the
truth
is
that
any
attempt
at
details
where
so
little
is
known
to
have
been
preserved
must
necessarily
of
itself
subject
to
doubt
any
narrative
not
fortified
by
the
most
conclusive
evidence
unfortunately
for
the
reverend
historian
his
known
eccentricities
as
a
writer
and
fondness
for
hyperbole
must
always
deprive
his
books
though
remarkably
useful
and
interesting
to
the
young
of
any
authority
which
might
be
claimed
for
them
as
histories
as
fictions
from
history
lively
and
romantic
they
are
certainly
very
astonishing
performances
have
amused
and
benefited
thousands
and
entitle
the
writer
to
a
rank
in
a
peculiar
walk
of
letters
which
has
not
yet
been
assigned
francis
marion
was
one
of
these
survivors
the
puny
boy
lived
through
the
terrors
and
sufferings
under
which
the
strong
men
perished
so
intense
were
their
sufferings
so
terrible
the
trial
that
it
will
not
greatly
task
the
imagination
to
recognize
in
the
preservation
of
the
youth
looking
to
his
future
usefulness
the
agency
of
a
special
providence
the
boy
was
preserved
for
other
times
and
fortunes
and
in
returning
to
his
mother
was
perhaps
better
prepared
to
heed
her
entreaties
that
he
should
abandon
all
idea
of
an
element
from
which
his
escape
had
been
so
hazardous
and
narrow
it
was
well
for
himself
and
country
that
he
did
so
it
can
scarcely
be
conjectured
that
his
achievements
on
the
sea
would
have
been
half
so
fortunate
or
half
so
honorable
to
himself
and
country
as
those
which
are
now
coupled
with
his
name
returning
to
his
home
and
parents
young
marion
sunk
once
more
into
the
humble
condition
of
the
farmer
his
health
and
strength
had
continued
to
improve
his
adventures
by
sea
had
served
seemingly
to
complete
that
change
for
the
better
in
his
physical
man
which
had
been
so
happily
begun
on
land
and
subduing
his
roving
inclinations
we
hear
of
him
only
in
a
period
of
ten
years
as
a
tiller
of
the
earth
in
this
vocation
he
betrayed
that
diligent
attention
to
his
duties
that
patient
hardihood
and
calm
equable
temper
which
distinguished
his
deportment
in
every
part
of
his
career
he
is
represented
as
equally
industrious
and
successful
as
a
farmer
the
resources
of
his
family
seem
to
have
been
very
moderate
there
were
several
children
and
before
francis
was
yet
years
of
age
he
lost
his
father
in
he
was
planting
with
his

this

he
continued

it

still
pointed

is
the
more
remarkable

within

his

and

contributed
to

so

famous
in

during

long
period
of

the
interval
between
his
shipwreck
and
removal
to

bluff
we
are
only
left
to
conjecture
his
employments
beyond
his
agricultural
labors
we
may
suppose
that
his
chief
tasks
were
the
cultivation
of
his
mind
by
close
application
to
those
studies
which
in
the
condition
of
the
country
sparsely
settled
and
without
teachers
were
usually
very
inadequately
urged
it
does
not
appear
that
his
acquisitions
in
this
respect
were
more
valuable
than
could
be
afforded
at
the
present
day
by
the
simplest
of
the
country
here
again
we
may
trace
the
resemblance
between
his
career
and
that
of
washington
equally
denied
the
advantages
of
education
they
equally
drew
from
the
great
of
nature
thrown
upon
their
own
thoughts
taught
by
observation
and
experience
the
same
results
of
character
firmness
temperance
good
sense
sagacious
foresight
and
deliberate
prudence
became
conspicuous
in
the
conduct
and
career
of
both
in
the
fortunes
of
neither
in
the
several
tasks
allotted
to
them
in
their
various
situations
did
their
deficiencies
of
education
appear
to
qualify
their
successes
or
diminish
the
respect
and
admiration
of
those
around
them
a
singular
fact
as
indicative
equally
of
the
modesty
the
good
sense
and
the
superior
intrinsic
worth
of
both
of
these
distinguished
persons
in
the
case
of
marion
his
want
of
education
neither
lessened
his
energies
his
confidence
in
himself
nor
baffled
any
of
his
natural
endowments
on
the
contrary
it
left
his
talents
free
to
their
natural
direction
these
it
is
probable
were
never
of
a
kind
to
derive
or
to
need
many
advantages
from
a
very
superior
or
scientific
education
his
mind
was
rather
practical
than
subtile
his
genius
prompted
him
to
action
rather
than
to
study
and
the
condition
and
necessities
of
the
country
calling
for
the
former
rather
than
the
latter
character
readily
reconciled
him
to
a
deficiency

the

military

of
the

at
the
opening
of
the
year
the
colony
of

was
on
the
eve
of
an
indian
war
the
whole
frontier
of
the
southern
provinces
from
pennsylvania
to
georgia
was
threatened
by
the

and
the

the

the

prepared

covered
with

and

it
happened
unfortunately
that
while
passing
along
the
frontiers
of
virginia
the
cherokees
many
of
whom
had
lost
their
horses
during
the
campaign
supplied
themselves
rather
unscrupulously
from
the
pastures
of
the
colonists
with
inconsiderate
anger
the
virginians
forgetting
the
late
valuable
services
of
the
savages
rose
upon
their
footsteps
slew
twelve
or
fourteen
of
their
warriors
and
made
prisoners
of
as
many
more
this
rash
and
severity
aroused
the
nation
the
young
warriors
flew
to
arms
and
pouring
their
active
hordes
upon
the
frontier
settlements
proceeded
to
the
work
of
slaughter
without
pausing
to
discriminate
between
the
offending
and
the
innocent
the
emergency
was
pressing
and
governor
lyttleton
of
south
carolina
called
out
the
militia
of
the
province
they
were
required
to
rendezvous
at
the
congarees
about
one
hundred
and
forty
miles
from

cavalry
commanded
by

but
he
was
not
yet
to

his
maiden
valor
upon
the
enemy
the
prompt
preparation
of
the
carolinians
had
somewhat
lessened
the
appetite
of
the
savages
for
war
perhaps
their
own
preparations
were
not
yet
sufficiently
complete
to
make
them
hopeful
of
its
issue
the
young
warriors
were
recalled
from
the
frontiers
and
a
deputation
of
chiefs
set
out
for
charleston
in
order
to
propitiate
the
anger
of
the
whites
and
arrest
the
threatened
invasion
of
their
country
whether
they
were
sincere
in
their
professions
or
simply
came
for
the
purpose
of
deluding
and
disarming
the
carolinians
is
a
question
with
the
historians
it
is
certain
that
governor
lyttleton
doubted
their
sincerity
refused
to
listen
to
their
explanations
and
carrying
them
along
with
him
rather
as
hostages
than
as
commissioners
in
sacred
trust
he
proceeded
to
meet
the
main
body
of
his
army
already
assembled
at
the
congarees
the
treatment
to
which
they
were
thus
subjected
filled
the
cherokee
deputies
with
indignation
which
with
the
usual
artifice
of
the
indian
they
yet
contrived
to
suppress
but
another
indiscreet
proceeding
of
the
governor
added
to
the
passion
which
they
felt
and
soon
baffled
all
their
powers
of
concealment
in
resuming
the
march
for
the
nation
he
put
them
into
formal
custody
placed
a
captain
guard
over
them
and
in
this
manner
hurried
them
to
the
frontiers
whatever
may
have
been
the
merits
of
this
movement
as
a
mere
military
precaution
it
was
of
very
bad
policy
in
a
civil
point
of
view
it
not
only
degraded
the
indian
chiefs
in
their
own
but
in
the
eyes
of
their
people
his
captives
deeply
and
openly
resented
this
indignity
and
breach
of
faith
and
brooding
in
sullen
ferocity
over
the
disgrace
which
they
suffered
meditated
in
silence
those
schemes
of
vengeance
which
they
subsequently
brought
to
a
fearful
maturity
but
though
thus
impetuous
and
imprudent
and
though
pressing
forward
as
if
with
the
most
determined
purposes
lyttleton
was
in
no
mood
for
war
his
policy
seems
to
have
contemplated
nothing
further
than
the
alarm
of
the
indians
neither
party
was
exactly
ripe
for
the
final
issue
the
cherokees
needed
time
for
preparation
and
the
governor
with
an
army
ill
disciplined
and
imperfectly
armed
found
it
politic
when
on
the
very
confines
of
the
enemy
country
to
do
that
which
he
might
very
well
have
done
in
charleston
listen
to
terms
of
accommodation
having
sent
for
attakullakullah
the
wise
man
of
the
nation
who
had
always
been
the
staunch
friend
of
the
whites
he
made
his
complaints
and
declared
his
readiness
for
peace
demanding
however
as
the
only
condition
on
which
it
could
be
granted
that
men
of
the
nation
should
be
delivered
to
him
to
be
disposed
of
as
he
should
think
proper
by
death
or
otherwise
as
an
atonement
for
that
number
of
carolinians
massacred
in
the
late
foray
of
the
savages
a
treaty
was
effected
but
with
some
difficulty
on
these
terms
compliance
with
this
requisition
was
not
so
easy
however
on
the
part
of
the
cherokee
chiefs
the
moment
it
was
understood
the
great
body
of
their
people
fled
to
the
mountains
and
the
number
of
hostages
could
be
secured
only
by
the
detention
of
of
those
chiefs
already
in
the
governor
custody
the
captives
were
placed
for
safe
keeping
at
the
frontier
fort
of

life

p
but
the
natural
sense
of
the
savage
is
not
inferior
to
that
by
which
the
laws
of
the
civilized
are
prescribed
in
their
dealings
with
one
another
the
treaty
thus
extorted
from
their
leaders
while
in
a
state
of
duress
was
disregarded
by
the
great
body
of
the
nation
they
watched
their
opportunity
and
scarcely
had
the
governor
disbanded
his
forces
when
the
resounded
from
the
frontiers
fort
prince
george
was
one
of
the
most
remote
of
a
chain
of
military
posts
by
which
the
intercourse
was
maintained
between
the
several
white
settlements
of
the
seaboard
and
the
interior
it
stood
on
the
banks
of
the
isundiga
river
about
three
hundred
miles
from
charleston
within
gunshot
of
the
indian
town
of
keowee
this
post
to
which
the
cherokee
hostages
were
carried
was
defended
by
cannon
and
maintained
by
a
small
force
under
colonel
cotymore
it
was
in
this
neighborhood
and
as
it
were
in
defiance
of
this
force
that
the
war
was
begun
fourteen
whites
were
massacred
at
a
blow
within
a
mile
of
this
station
this
was
followed
up
by
a
stratagem
by
which
occonostota
one
of
the
principal
warriors
aimed
to
obtain
possession
of
the
fort
pretending
to
have
something
of
importance
to
communicate
to
the
commander
he
dispatched
a
woman
who
had
usually
obtained
access
to
the
station
to
solicit
an
interview
with
him
this
was
to
take
place
on
the
banks
of
the
river
meanwhile
the
savage
prepared
his
ambush
cotymore
imprudently
assented
to
the
meeting
and
attended
by
lieutenants
bell
and
foster
walked
down
towards
the
river
from
the
opposite
side
of
which
occonostota
addressed
him
while
they
spoke
the
indian
was
seen
to
wave
a
bridle
over
his
head
this
was
the
signal
agreed
upon
with
the
ambushed
warriors
at
this
signal
they
rose
and
poured
in
their
fire
cotymore
was
slain
on
the
spot
and
his
companions
wounded
but
the
savages
failed
to
get
possession
of
the
fort
suspecting
a
concerted
movement
among
the
hostages
by
which
they
would
cooperate
with
the
assailing
foe
without
the
officer
in
command
of
the
fort
gave
orders
to
secure
them
with
irons
the
attempt
to
obey
these
orders
ended
in
a
bloody
tragedy
the
indians
resisted
with
arms
and
stabbing
three
of
the
soldiers
so
exasperated
the
rest
already
excited
by
the
murder
of
their
captain
that
they
fell
upon
the
miserable
wretches
and
butchered
them
to
a
man
this
unhappy
event
completing
what
the
indiscreet
severities
of
governor
lyttleton
had
begun
united
the
whole
nation
of
cherokees
in
war
there
had
been
a
strong
party
favorable
to
peace
and
friendly
to
the
whites
this
unfortunate
proceeding
involved
the
loss
of
this
party
the
hostages
were
among
their
chief
men
and
scarcely
a
family
in
the
nation
but
lost
a
relative
or
friend
in
their
massacre
they
were
now
unanimous
for
battle
and
numerous
parties
rushing
simultaneously
down
upon
the
frontiers
baffled
the
courage
and
prevented
the
flight
of
the
fugitives
they
fell
without
distinction
upon
men
women
and
children
such
as
fled
to
the
woods
and
escaped
the
perished
of
hunger
every
day
brought
fresh
accounts
to
the
capital
of
their
ravages
murders
and
desolations
but
while
the
back
settlers
looked
to
their
governor
for
relief
the
raged
to
such
a
degree
in
town
that
few
of
the
militia
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
leave
their
distressed
families
to
serve
the
public
lyttleton
meanwhile
by
whom
all
the
mischief
was
occasioned
was
made
governor
of
jamaica
and
the
charge
of
the
colony
devolved
on
william

a
native
a
man
of
great
integrity
and
erudition
in
the
almost
hopeless
condition
of
the
province
her
sisters
north
carolina
and
virginia
raised
seven
troops
of
rangers
for
the
frontiers
and
colonel
montgomery
afterwards
earl
of

was
dispatched
from

with
a
battalion
of
highlanders

companies
of
royal
scots
before
the
end
of

the
camp
of
rendezvous
for
a
new
invasion
of
the
cherokee
territories
was
established
at
monk
corner
meanwhile
the
health
of
carolina
had
undergone
some
improvement
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
were
not
idle
they
turned
out
in
force
as
volunteers
and
under
the
spirited
direction
of
governor
bull
the
whole
disposable
force
of
the
province
was
put
in
requisition
among
these
it
is
not
so
sure
but
is
believed
that
francis
marion
once
more
made
his
appearance
as
a
volunteer
from
what
we
know
of
his
character
his
temperament
and
that
unsatisfied
craving
which
he
seems
to
have
shown
from
the
beginning
for
such
excitements
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
his
presence
in
the
field
but
though
asserted
by
tradition
we
confess
that
the
records
are
silent
on
the
subject
unsatisfactory
as
at
that
period
they
generally
are
on
this
point
they
are
particularly
so
and
but
that
his
share
in
this
war
before
its
final
conclusion
was
not
only
unquestionable
but
conspicuous
we
should
pass
over
the
campaign
of
montgomery
with
a
simple
reference
to
its
results
hewatt
hist
the
cherokees
meanwhile
were
not
unobservant
of
the
preparations
and
approaches
of
the
carolinians
they
gathered
themselves
up
for
defence
and
in
silence
matured
their
half
civilized
half
primitive
modes
of
warfare
this
people
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
were
a
people
of
very
superior
endowments
and
resources
to
any
of
the
neighboring
savage
nations
if
less
warlike
in
the
simple
sense
of
the
word
than
their
rivals
the
creeks
they
were
really
more
to
be
feared
as
it
was
in
consequence
of
their
superior
civilisation
that
they
had
lost
some
of
their
brute
ferocity
if
they
were
less
reckless
they
were
better
skilled
if
less
frantic
in
their
fury
they
coupled
it
with
a
wary
vindictiveness
which
rendered
the
blow
more
fatal
when
it
fell
the
advances
which
they
had
made
in
civilisation
had
naturally
increased
their
numbers
while
the
novel
tastes
by
which
their
wandering
habits
were
diminished
had
necessarily
added
to
their
love
of
country
in
adding
to
the
resources
and
improvements
by
which
its
comforts
and
delights
were
increased
thus
neither
degraded
by
the
lowest
condition
in
which
we
find
the
human
animal
nor
enervated
by
the
superior
luxuries
to
which
he
may
attain
the

was
perhaps
at
this
time
in
possession
of
his
greatest
vigor
not
very

his
moral
and
physical
condition
from
the

overcame

the
numerical
force
of
this
great
aboriginal
people
seemed
of
itself
sufficiently
strong
to
promise
security
to
their
country
at
the
time
of

they

no
less
than

weapons
of
european
warfare
were
accustomed
to
that
warfare
and
were
thus
doubly
prepared
to
encounter
the
enemy
in
whose
ranks
they
had
received
their
best
military
lessons
such
a
force
very
far
exceeded
that
of
the
carolinians
mustering
but
two
thousand
men
montgomery
found
it
advisable
to
urge
his
march
upon
the
nation
with
equal
celerity
and
caution
having
reached
a
place
called
river
within
twenty
miles
of
the
indian
town
of
estatoee
he
advanced
by
night
upon
it
secretly
and
with
a
view
to
its
surprise
in
his
march
surrounding
the
town
of
little
keowee
not
a
warrior
of
the
cherokees
escaped
the
sword
his
success
was
less
complete
at
estatoee
the
indians
apprised
of
his
approach
with
few
exceptions
succeeded
in
making
their
escape
but
the
town
consisting
of
more
than
two
hundred
houses
and
well
stored
with
corn
hogs
poultry
and
ammunition
perished
in
the
flames
shugaw
town
and
every
other
settlement
in
the
lower
nation
shared
the
same
fate
the
rapidity
of
the
march
had
taken
the
savages
everywhere
in
this
part
of
the
country
by
surprise
they
fled
rather
than
fought
and
while
they
lost
everything
in
the
shape
of
property
but
few
of
them
were
slain
they
sought
for
shelter
among
their
more
numerous
and
better
protected
brethren
of
the
mountains
a
people
neither
so
easily
approached
nor
so
easily
overcome
montgomery
having
finished
this
part
of
his
work
so
successfully
hurried
on
to
the
relief
of
fort
prince
george
which
from
the
time
when
their
chiefs
were
so
cruelly
butchered
within
its
walls
had
been
closely
invested
by
a
formidable
force
of
cherokees
the
fort
was
relieved
the
indians
fled
at
his
approach
and
thinking
that
the
severe
chastisement
which
he
had
inflicted
upon
them
had
inclined
their
hearts
to
peace
the
general
of
the
carolinians
paused
in
his
progress
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
sue
for
it
as
the
former
friends
and
allies
of
the
english
but
he
had
mistaken
the
stubborn
nature
of
his
foe
they
were
not
sufficiently
humbled
and
it
was
resolved
to
march
upon
the
middle
settlements
to
this
task
that
which
had
been
performed
was
comparatively
easy
they
were
now
to
enter
upon
a
different
country
where
the
indians
were
better
prepared
for
them
nay
where
they
had
prepared
for
them
in
all
probability
to
the
neglect
of
the
lower
towns
toilsome
and
full
of
peril
was
this
march
dismal
and
dense
was
the
wilderness
which
they
were
now
to
penetrate
rugged
paths
narrow
passes
gloomy
thickets
and
dark
ravines
encountered
them
in
their
hourly
progress
calling
for
constant
vigilance
and
the
maintenance
of
all
their
courage
rivers
fordable
in
unfrequent
places
and
overlooked
by
precipitous
banks
on
either
side
crowned
most
commonly
by
dense
and
intricate
masses
of
forest
through
which
and
without
a
guide
our
little
army
was
compelled
to
pass
presented
opportunities
for
frequent
ambush
and
attack
in
which
very
inferior
forces
if
properly
commanded
might
with
little
danger
to
themselves
overwhelm
and
utterly
destroy
an
advancing
enemy
it
was
in
such
a
region
that
the
cherokees
made
their
first
and
formidable
stand
within
five
miles
of
etchoee
the
nearest
town
of
the
middle
settlements
the
army
of
montgomery
approached
a
low
valley
clothed
with
a
thicket
so
dense
that
the
soldiers
could
scarcely
discern
objects
three
paces
ahead
through
this
thicket
ran
a
muddy
river
enclosed
between
steep
banks
of
clay
this
passage
where
but
few
men
could
act
in
unison
was
that
through
which
it
became
necessary
that
the
army
should
proceed
it
was
the
very
spot
which
over
all
others
a
sagacious
warrior
would
choose
in
which
to
place
an
ambush
or
meet
a
superior
assailant
montgomery
knew
his
enemy
and
prepared
for
the
encounter
captain
morrison
commanding
a
company
of
rangers
native
marksmen
and
well
acquainted
with
the
forest
was
sent
forward
to
scour
the
thicket
his
advance
was
the
signal
for
battle
scarcely
had
he
entered
upon
the
dismal
passage
when
the
savages
rose
from
their
and
poured
in
a
severe
fire
morrison
with
several
of
his
men
perished
at
the
first
discharge
they
were
sustained
by
the
light
infantry
and
grenadiers
who
boldly
advanced
upon
the
wood
in
the
face
of
the
invisible
foe
a
heavy
fire
followed
on
both
sides
the
cherokees
each
with
his
eye
upon
his
man
the
carolinians
aiming
at
the
flash
of
the
enemy
guns
the
pass
was
disputed
by
the
savages
with
a
degree
of
conduct
and
courage
which
left
the
issue
doubtful
the
necessity
was
apparent
for
extraordinary
effort
the
royal
scots
who
were
in
the
rear
were
now
pushed
forward
to
take
possession
of
a
rising
ground
on
the
right
while
the
highlanders
were
marched
forward
to
the
immediate
support
of
the
infantry
and
grenadiers
this
movement
had
the
effect
of
bringing
the
enemy
into
close
action
the
bayonet
stirred
and
laid
bare
the
thicket
the
woods
resounded
with
the
shouts
and
yells
of
the
cherokees
but
they
no
longer
fell
with
terror
upon
the
ear
of
the
whites
they
had
grown
familiar
the
savages
yielded
slowly
as
the
bayonet
advanced
suffering
severely
as
they
fled
they
yet
displayed
the
native
obstinacy
of
their
race
turning
upon
the
pursuer
when
they
could
availing
themselves
of
tree
or
thicket
to
retard
by
shot
or
stroke
the
assailants
and
even
in
flight
only
so
far
keeping
ahead
of
the
bayonet
as
to
avoid
its
stroke
as
he
beheld
this
montgomery
changed
the
head
of
his
army
and
advanced
upon
the
town
of
etchoee
which
it
had
been
their
purpose
to
defend
and
from
which
they
now
strove
to
divert
him
this
movement
alarmed
them
for
their
wives
and
children
their
retreat
became
a
flight
and
satisfied
with
having
inflicted
upon
them
this
measure
of
punishment
the
british
general
prepared
to
march
back
to
fort
prince
george
this
decision
was
the
result
of
his
exigencies
the
situation
of
his
army
was
neither
a
safe
nor
an
agreeable
one
the
victory
was
with
the
carolinians
yet
the
affair
was
very
far
from
decisive
in
its
consequences
the
enemy
had
only
retired
from
one
advantageous
position
to
another
they
waited
his
approach
only
to
renew
a
conflict
in
which
even
victory
might
be
without
its
fruits
to
gain
a
battle
unless
a
final
one
was
with
a
force
so
small
as
his
a
matter
of
very
doubtful
advantage
he
was
already
encumbered
with
his
wounded
to
furnish
horses
for
whom
he
was
compelled
to
discard
and
to
destroy
a
large
quantity
of
the
provisions
necessary
for
the
army
what
remained
was
measured
with
a
nice
reference
to
their
absolute
wants
on
the
return
march
to
prince
george
under
these
suggestions
of
prudence
the
retreat
was
begun
it
was
conducted
with
admirable
regularity
the
cherokees
meanwhile
hung
upon
the
retiring
footsteps
of
the
invaders
annoying
them
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
sixty
miles
of
mountainous
country
were
traversed
in
this
manner
and
under
various
hardships
with
a
skill
and
intrepidity
which
confer
the
highest
credit
upon
the
english
captain
a
large
train
of
wounded
was
brought
to
the
frontier
without
the
loss
of
a
man
we
have
admitted
an
uncertainty
as
to
the
presence
of
marion
in
this
campaign
it
would
be
impertinent
and
idle
therefore
to
speculate
upon
his
performances
or
the
share
which
he
might
have
taken
in
its
events
tradition
simply
assures
us
that
he
distinguished
himself
that
if
present
he
did
his
duty
we
have
no
question
and
enduring
with
becoming
resolution
the
worst
severities
of
the
march
proved
himself
possessed
of
the
first
great

marion
leads
the
forlorn
hope
at
the
battle
of
etchoee
the
cherokees
were
very
far
from
being
subdued
or
satisfied
the
snake
had
been
scotched
not
killed
and
stung
rather
than
humbled
by
the
chastisement
they
received
they
prepared
to
assume
the
offensive
with
sudden
vigor
concentrating
a
numerous
force
upon
the
distant
garrison
of
fort
loudon
on
the
tennessee
river
they
succeeded
in
reducing
it
by
famine
here
they
took
bloody
revenge
for
the
massacre
of
their
chiefs
at
prince
george
the
garrison
was
butchered
after
a
formal
surrender
upon
terms
which
guaranteed
them
protection
this
wholesale
and
vindictive
barbarity
while
it
betrayed
the
spirit
which
filled
the
savages
had
the
still
farther
effect
of
encouraging
them
in
a
warfare
which
had
so
far
gratified
very
equally
their
appetites
for
blood
and
booty
in
addition
to
this
natural
effect
the
result
of
their
own
wild
passions
there
were
other
influences
from
without
at
work
among
them
certain
french
emissaries
had
crept
into
their
towns
and
were
busily
engaged
with
bribes
and
arguments
in
stimulating
them
to
continued
warfare
this
in
all
probability
was
the
secret
influence
which
over
all
kept
them
from
listening
as
well
to
their
own
fears
as
to
the
urgent
suggestions
of
the
british
authorities
for
peace
hitherto
the
cherokees
had
given
no
ear
to
the
temptations
of
the
french
whom
they
considered
a
frivolous
people
and
whose
professions
of
faith
they
were
very
likely
to
have
regarded
with
distrust
but
the
labors
of
their
emissaries
at
this
juncture
harmonizing
with
the
temper
of
the
nation
were
necessarily
more
than
usually
successful
one
of
these
emissaries
louis
latinac
an
officer
of
considerable
talent
proved
an
able
instigator
to
mischief
he
persuaded
them
against
the
better
reason
of
their
older
chiefs
to
the
rejection
of
every
overture
for
peace
their
successes
at
fort
loudon
were
perhaps
sufficient
arguments
for
the
continuance
of
war
but
there
were
others
not
less
potent
the
king
of
france
was
now
to
be
their
ally
in
place
of
him
of
great
britain
the
one
great
father
was
no
less
able
than
the
other
to
minister
to
their
appetites
and
necessities
his
arms
and
ammunition
replaced
those
which
had
been
withdrawn
by
the
latter
and
we
may
suppose
that
the
liberality
of
the
new
allies
was
such
as
to
admit
of
very
favorable
comparison
and
contrast
with
that
which
they
had
experienced
at
the
hands
of
the
british
their
very
excesses
in
the
war
were
favorable
to
its
continuance
as
they
might
very
well
doubt
the
binding
force
of
treaties
between
parties
the
bad
faith
of
whom
had
been
written
so
terribly
in
blood
at
a
great
meeting
of
the
nation
at
which
louis
latinac
was
present
he
with
something
of
their
own
manner
seizing
suddenly
upon
a
hatchet
struck
it
violently
into
a
block
of
wood
exclaiming
as
he
did
so
who
is
the
warrior
that
will
take
this
up
for
the
king
of
france
salouee
a
young
chief
of
estatoee
instantly
tore
the
weapon
from
the
tree
he
declared
himself
for
instant
and
continued
war
the
spirits
of
our
slain
brothers
was
his
cry
call
upon
us
to
avenge
their
massacre
he
is
a
woman
that
dares
not
follow
me
such
being
the
spirit
of
the
savages
the
carolinians
had
no
alternative
but
to
resume
their
arms
montgomery
having
gone
to
england
the
command
devolved
upon
colonel
grant
and
the
highlanders
were
once
more
ordered
to
the
relief
of
the
province
the
carolinians
were
now
somewhat
better
prepared
to
cooperate
with
their
allies
a
native
regiment
of
twelve
hundred
men
was
raised
and
the
command
given
to
middleton
a
brave
and
accomplished
provincial
officer
to
this
regiment
marion
was
attached
under
the
immediate
command
of
moultrie
many
of
his
associates
in
this
cherokee
war
became
subsequently
like
himself
distinguished
in
the
war
with
great
britain
among
these
may
be
mentioned
the
names
of
moultrie
henry
laurens
andrew
pickens
and
isaac
huger
these
were
all
officers
even
in
that
early
day
and
marion
himself
held
a
lieutenancy
some
proof
that
however
little
we
may
know
of
the
circumstances
by
which
he
secured
the
confidence
of
his
neighbors
he
was
already
in
full
possession
of
it
how
much
of
the
future
acts
and
successes
of
these
brave
men
was
due
to
the
exercises
and
events
of
this
cherokee
war
may
reasonably
be
conjectured
by
every
reader
who
knows
the
value
of
a
stern
apprenticeship
to
a
hazardous
profession
its
successive
campaigns
against
no
inferior
enemy
and
under
circumstances
of
peril
and
privation
of
no
common
order
were
such
as
must
have
afforded
them
frequent
opportunity
of
making
themselves
familiar
equally
with
the
exigencies
and
responsibilities
of
command
moultrie
in
his
memoirs
vol
would
seem
to
settle
the
question
in
the
negative
whether
marion
was
or
was
not
in
the
preceding
campaign
he
says
general
marion
and
myself
entered
the
field
of
mars
together
in
an
expedition
against
the
cherokee
indians
under
the
command
of
colonel
james
grant
in
when
i
had
the
honor
to
command
a
light
infantry
company
in
a
provincial
regiment
he
was
my
first
lieutenant
he
was
an
active
brave
and
hardy
soldier
and
an
excellent
partisan
officer
this
is
very
far
however
from
being
conclusive
inasmuch
as
we
have
seen
that
marion
the
field
of
mars
two
years
before
under
the
command
of
his
brother
in
the
first
campaign
of
lyttleton
against
the
indians
this
latter
fact
is
settled
beyond
all
to
the
united
forces
of
colonels
grant
and
middleton
were
added
a
certain
number
of
chickasaw
and
catawba
indians
making
a
total
of
hundred
men
this
army
reached
fort
prince
george
on
the
of
may
on
the
of
june
following
it
took
up
the
line
of
march
for
the
enemy
country
the
advance
was
conducted
with
caution
but
without
molestation
until
it
reached
the
place
where
montgomery
in
the
previous
campaign
had
encountered
the
indians
near
the
town
of
etchoee
here
the
cherokees
were
again
prepared
to
make
a
stand
and
to
dispute
a
pass
which
above
all
others
seemed
to
be
admirably
designed
by
nature
for
the
purposes
of
defence
their
position
was
not
exactly
what
it
had
been
on
the
previous
occasion
but
its
characteristic
advantages
were
the
same
hitherto
the
indians
had
shown
considerable
judgment
in
the
selection
of
their
and
in
the
general
employment
of
their
strength
this
judgment
they
probably
owed
in
great
part
to
their
present
adversaries
quick
in
their
instinct
and
surprisingly
observant
they
had
soon
learned
the
use
of
european
weapons
the
various
lessons
of
european
tactics
the
modes
of
attack
and
defence
were
in
their
united
struggles
with
the
french
equally
open
to
their
study
and
acquisition
they
had
not
suffered
these
lessons
to
escape
them
but
they
probably
owed
something
of
their
skill
in
the
present
war
to
the
active
counsels
of
the
french
emissaries
the
fact
is
not
recorded
by
the
historian
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
officers
who
counselled
the
war
would
withhold
themselves
when
the
opportunity
offered
from
giving
directions
in
the
field
the
french
had
frequently
distinguished
themselves
by
leading
on
forces
entirely
composed
of
indians
the
practice
was
common
even
at
the
defeat
of
braddock
the
french
troops
bore
but
a
small
proportion
to
their
indian
allies
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
louis
latinac
was
not
present
at
one
or
both
of
the
bloody
fields
of
etchoee
the
provincial
army
marched
in
good
order
upon
the
suspected
position
the
indian
auxiliaries
who
were
in
the
van
first
discovered
signs
of
an
enemy
the
cherokees
were
in
possession
of
a
hill
strongly
posted
and
in
considerable
force
upon
the
right
flank
of
the
army
finding
themselves
discovered
they
opened
their
fire
upon
the
advanced
guard
and
followed
it
up
with
a
gallant
charge
but
the
van
being
vigorously
and
promptly
supported
they
were
driven
back
and
resumed
their
position
upon
the
hill
under
this
hill
the
line
of
march
lay
for
a
considerable
distance
to
attempt
therefore
to
continue
the
march
before
dislodging
the
enemy
in
possession
of
it
would
be
to
expose
the
troops
to
a
protracted
fire
the
more
murderous
as
it
would
be
delivered
by
a
foe
in
a
position
of
perfect
security
the
advanced
guard
was
ordered
upon
this
duty
and
from
this
body
a
of
thirty
men
was
chosen
to
force
the
perilous
entrance
to
the
foe
the
command
of
this
devoted
corps
was
assigned
to
francis
marion
still
a
lieutenant
under
the
command
of
moultrie
in
the
provincial
regiment
of
middleton
the
ascent
of
the
hill
was
by
means
of
a
gloomy
defile
through
which
the
little
band
headed
gallantly
by
their
leader
advanced
with
due
rapidity
a
considerable
body
of
the
army
moving
forward
at
the
same
time
in
support
of
the
advance
scarcely
had
the
detachment
penetrated
the
defile
when
the
gave
the
signal
the
savages
still
concealed
poured
in
a
deadly
fire
by
which
no
less
than
of
this
fated
band
were
prostrated
fortunately
their
leader
was
not
among
them
he
seems
like
washington
to
have
been
the
special
care
of
providence
the
residue
were
only
saved
from
destruction
by
the
proximity
of
the
advance
whose
hurried
approach
while
giving
them
safety
brought
on
the
main
action
the
battle
was
fought
with
great
carnage
on
both
sides
the
cherokees
were
not
only
well
posted
but
they
were
in
great
numbers
repeatedly
dislodged
by
the
bayonet
they
as
repeatedly
returned
to
the
attack
and
driven
from
one
quarter
rallied
upon
another
with
a
tenacious
and
unshaken
valor
becoming
in
men
who
were
defending
the
passes
to
the
bosom
of
their
country
from
eight
in
the
morning
until
noon
the
fight
was
continued
not
only
without
intermission
but
seemingly
without
any
decisive
results
on
either
side
but
at
length
the
patient
resolution
of
the
whites
prevailed
and
about
two
in
the
day
the
field
was
yielded
by
the
reluctant
cherokees
to
their
superior
foes
this
victory
determined
the
fate
of
etchoee
a
town
of
considerable
size
which
was
reduced
to
ashes
weems
horry
memoir
p
the
result
of
this
fierce
engagement
seems
to
have
broken
the
spirit
of
the
nation
they
had
chosen
the
position
of
greatest
strength
to
make
their
stand
and
brought
to
the
struggle
their
best
spirits
and
bravest
warriors
in
the
issue
they
had
shown
by
their
dogged
and
determined
valor
the
great
importance
which
it
carried
in
their
eyes
the
day
once
decided
against
them
they
appeared
to
be
equally
without
heart
and
hope
they
no
longer
appeared
in
arms
no
longer
offered
defence
and
the
army
of
the
carolinians
marched
through
the
heart
of
the
nation
searching
its
secret
settlements
and
everywhere
inflicting
the
severest
penalties
of
war
the
rest
of
the
campaign
was
an
easy
progress
and
terrible
was
the
retribution
which
it
brought
with
it
no
less
than
fourteen
of
their
towns
in
the
middle
settlements
shared
the
fate
of
etchoee
their
granaries
were
yielded
to
the
flames
their
cornfields
ravaged
while
the
miserable
fugitives
flying
from
the
unsparing
sword
took
refuge
with
their
almost
starving
families
among
the
barren
mountains
which
could
yield
them
little
but
security
a
chastisement
so
extreme
was
supposed
to
be
necessary
in
order
to
subdue
for
ever
that
lively
disposition
for
war
upon
the
smallest
provocation
which
of
late
years
the
cherokees
had
manifested
but
too
frequently
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
means
which
were
employed
for
administering
this
admonitory
lesson
were
of
the
most
legitimate
character
we
must
always
continue
to
doubt
that
humanity
required
the
destruction
of
towns
and
hamlets
whose
miserable
walls
of
clay
and
roofs
of
thatch
could
give
shelter
to
none
but
babes
and
sucklings
women
with
their
young
those
who
had
never
offended
and
those
who
could
not
well
offend
the
innocent
victims
to
an
authority
which
they
never
dared
oppose
the
reckless
destruction
of
their
granaries
fields
yet
growing
with
grain
necessarily
exposed
to
the
worst
privations
of
famine
only
those
portions
of
the
savage
population
who
were
least
guilty
the
warrior
and
hunter
could
readily
relieve
himself
from
the
gnawing
necessities
of
hunger
he
could
wander
off
to
remote
tribes
and
armed
with
rifle
or
bow
could
easily
secure
his
game
sufficient
for
his
own
wants
from
the
contiguous
forest
but
these
were
resources
inaccessible
to
the
weak
the
old
the
timid
and
the
imbecile
surely
it
was
a
cruel
measure
of
war
and
if
necessary
to
the
safety
of
the
whites
renders
still
more
criminal
the
wanton
excesses
of
the
latter
by
which
it
was
originally
provoked
it
is
pleasing
to
be
able
to
show
that
marion
felt
in
this
matter
as
became
that
rare
humanity
which
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
and
lovely
traits
in
his
character
the
more
remarkable
indeed
as
shining
out
among
endowments
which
in
particular
designated
him
for
a
military
life
a
life
which
is
supposed
to
need
for
its
stimulus
so
much
that
is
sanguinary
if
not
brutal
in
one
nature
it
is
recorded
of
him
that
the
severities
practised
in
this
campaign
filled
him
long
after
with
recollections
of
sorrow
writing
to
a
friend
he
gives
a
brief
description
of
the
calamities
of
the
war
in
terms
equally
touching
and
picturesque
we
arrived
he
writes
at
the
indian
towns
in
the
month
of
july
as
the
lands
were
rich
and
the
season
had
been
favorable
the
corn
was
bending
under
the
double
weight
of
lusty
roasting
ears
and
pods
of
clustering
beans
the
furrows
seemed
to
rejoice
under
their
precious
loads
the
fields
stood
thick
with
bread
we
encamped
the
first
night
in
the
woods
near
the
fields
where
the
whole
army
feasted
on
the
young
corn
which
with
fat
venison
made
a
most
delicious
treat
in
a
letter
quoted
by
weems
the
poetic
language
here
suggests
the
possibility
that
this
letter
may
be
one
of
weems
a
the
next
morning
we
proceeded
by
order
of
colonel
grant
to
burn
down
the
indian
cabins
some
of
our
men
seemed
to
enjoy
this
cruel
work
laughing
very
heartily
at
the
curling
flames
as
they
mounted
over
the
tops
of
the
huts
but
to
me
it
appeared
a
shocking
sight
poor
creatures
thought
i
we
surely
need
not
grudge
you
such
miserable
habitations
but
when
we
came
according
to
orders
to
cut
down
the
fields
of
corn
i
could
scarcely
refrain
from
tears
for
who
could
see
the
stalks
that
stood
so
stately
with
broad
green
leaves
and
shocks
filled
with
sweet
milky
fluid
and
flour
the
staff
of
life
who
i
say
without
grief
could
see
these
sacred
plants
sinking
under
our
swords
with
all
their
precious
load
to
wither
and
rot
untasted
in
their
mourning
fields
i
saw
everywhere
around
the
footsteps
of
the
little
indian
children
where
they
had
lately
played
under
the
shelter
of
the
rustling
corn
no
doubt
they
had
often
looked
up
with
joy
to
the
swelling
shocks
and
gladdened
when
they
thought
of
their
abundant
cakes
for
the
coming
winter
when
we
are
gone
thought
i
they
will
return
and
peeping
through
the
weeds
with
tearful
eyes
will
mark
the
ghastly
ruin
poured
over
their
homes
and
the
happy
fields
where
they
had
so
often
played
did
this
they
will
ask
their
mothers
white
people
the
christians
did
it
will
be
the
reply
it
would
be
no
easy
matter
says
hewatt
the
earliest
regular
historian
of
carolina
to
describe
the
hardships
which
this
little
army
endured
in
the
wilderness
from
heat
thirst
watching
danger
and
fatigue
thirty
days
did
colonel
grant
continue
in
the
heart
of
the
cherokee
territories
and
upon
his
return
to
fort
prince
george
the
feet
and
legs
of
many
of
his
army
were
so
mangled
and
their
strength
and
spirits
so
much
exhausted
that
they
were
unable
to
march
farther
but
the
chastisement
which
the
indians
had
received
secured
the
object
for
the
attainment
of
which
it
was
inflicted
the
cherokees
sued
for
peace
and
marion
once
more
retired
to
the
obscurity
of
rural
life
we
may
well
believe
with
a
human
sense
of
satisfaction
that
the
painful
duty
upon
which
he
had
been
engaged
was
at
length
over
unhappily
the
details
of
the
war
beyond
those
which
we
have
given
do
not
enable
us
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
his
services
we
are
simply
told
that
he
behaved
well
with
skill
and
spirit
more
than
this
perhaps
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
from
any
degree
of
talent
in
the
subordinate
situation
which
he
at
that
time
occupied
chapter
marion
is
returned
for
the
provincial

from
john
berkeley
made

in
the
second
regiment
fort
johnson
taken
battle
of
fort
moultrie
engaged
in
rural
and
domestic
occupations
we
hear
no
more
of
marion
except
as
a
citizen
and
farmer
until
the
beginning
of
the
year
in
the
latter
capacity
he
is
reputed
to
have
been
successful
and
between
the
labors
and
sports
of
the
field
the
more
violent
humors
of
youth
seem
to
have
been
dissipated
in
exercises
which
are
seldom
followed
by
reproach
he
was
very
fond
of
angling
and
hunting
and
with
rod
or
gun
his
leisure
was
employed
in
a
way
that
would
not
have
displeased
the
gentle
isaak
walton
these
constituted
his
chief
pastimes
for
the
fourteen
years
that
had
elapsed
since
his
cherokee
campaigns
his
connection
with
public
events
had
long
since
ceased
but
from
all
accounts
he
still
continued
in
some
degree
to
fill
the
eyes
of
his
countrymen
his
firmness
and
purity
of
character
his
gentle
temper
known
bravery
and
the
conduct
which
he
had
already
manifested
in
war
had
secured
to
him
the
confidence
and
the
affections
of
his
neighbors
he
had
attained
that
place
in
their
esteem
which
naturally
brought
him
conspicuously
before
their
eyes
in
the
moment
of
emergency
emergencies
were
now
approaching
of
a
kind
well
calculated
to
bring
into
the
field
all
the
energies
with
all
the
patriotism
of
the
country
the
great
struggle
was
at
hand
between
the
colonies
and
that
mighty
empire
by
which
they
had
been
established
of
the
part
taken
by
south
carolina
in
this
conflict
history
has
already
sufficiently
informed
us
her
movements
were
made
without
reserve
her
resolves
taken
promptly
and
steadily
maintained
with
her
best
blood
and
treasure
her
battles
were
among
the
boldest
and
bloodiest
as
they
were
among
the
first
and
last
of
the
revolution
of
the
political
steps
by
which
she
committed
herself
to
that
event
it
does
not
need
that
we
should
enter
into
details
these
belong
rather
to
general
history
than
to
biography
it
will
be
enough
to
exhibit
those
particulars
only
of
her
progress
in
which
the
subject
of
our
memoir
was
more
immediately
interested
that
he
took
an
early
and
deep
concern
in
the
contest
may
be
inferred
from
his
character
that
he
should
not
have
become
an
active
politician
may
also
be
inferred
from
his
known
modesty
and
the
general
reserve
of
his
deportment
in
society
he
was
no
orator
and
no
doubt
felt
quite
as
awkward
in
debate
as
washington
but
his
opinions
were
well
known
he
was
not
the
person
about
whose
ways
of
thinking
in
trying
times
his
neighbors
could
entertain
either
doubt
or
discussion
he
formed
his
opinions
as
promptly
as
he
fought
for
them
and
his
character
was
above
concealment
we
find
him
accordingly
in
returned
to
the
provincial
congress
of
south
carolina
as
a
member
from
john
berkeley
this
congress
distinguished
itself
by
committing
the
people
of
south
carolina
to
the
final
destinies
of
the
revolution
it
adopted
the
american
bill
of
rights
as
declared
by
the
continental
congress
adopted
the
famous
act
of
association
recommended
by
the
same
federative
body
to
all
the
colonies
by
which
the
subscribers
bound
themselves
to
refuse
and
to
prevent
the
importation
of
goods
wares
and
merchandise
from
the
mother
country
established
committees
of
safety
throughout
the
province
and
in
short
in
possession
of
almost
dictatorial
powers
did
not
hesitate
to
use
them
for
the
public
welfare
it
was
at
particular
pains
to
infuse
a
martial
spirit
among
the
people
and
influenced
by
this
spirit
and
under
the
immediate
suggestion
and
by
direct
participation
of
this
assembly
certain
overt
acts
of
treason
were
committed
the
public
armory
in
charleston
was
broken
open
by
night
and
eight
hundred
stand
of
arms
two
hundred
cutlasses
besides
cartouches
flints
matches
and
other
necessary
materials
of
war
were
withdrawn
without
discovery
one
party
possessed
itself
of
the
public
powder
at
hobcau
another
emptied
cochran
magazine
while
a
third
as
above
stated
relieved
the
state
armory
of
its
contents
in
all
these
proceedings
the
members
of
the
provincial
congress
displayed
the
energies
of
men
who
having
once
set
their
hands
to
the
plough
have
resolved
not
to
be
turned
away
from
it
under
that
bolder
policy
which
by
provoking
the
danger
compels
the
timid
to
a
part
in
it
from
which
they
might
otherwise
shrink
in
terror
they
were
personally
engaged
in
these
acts
of
treason
we
may
reasonably
conclude
that
however
silent
as
a
member
francis
marion
was
not
the
person
to
forbear
taking
active
part
in
the
more
hazardous
duties
which
distinguished
the
doings
of
the
body
to
which
he
belonged
there
was
a
generous
impulse
in
his
character
which
hurried
him
into
performance
whenever
work
was
to
be
done
or
daring
became
necessary
he
could
approach
such
duties
with
a
degree
of
cheerfulness
which
to
the
ordinary
mind
thoughtful
only
of
the
consequences
and
responsibilities
of
action
seemed
to
partake
of
levity
and
recklessness
there
was
indeed
an
element
of
playfulness
we
had
almost
said
fun
in
his
character
a
quiet
and
unobtrusive
humor
which
enlivened
his
utterance
and
softened
with
a
gentle
aspect
a
countenance
that
might
otherwise
have
been
esteemed
severe
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
native
courage
and
the
elastic
spirit
of
his
temperament
made
him
an
active
participant
in
all
those
deeds
of
decision
which
the
deliberations
of
the
body
to
which
he
belonged
deemed
it
necessary
should
be
done
we
can
very
well
imagine
him
conspicuous
among
those
masked
and
midnight
bands
commissioned
to
do
mischief
for
the
public
good
by
which
the
arsenals
were
stripped
of
their
contents

it
is
not

generally

that
south

did
her
part
as
well
as
massachusetts
in
destroying

and
stamped

shortened
by
the
occurrence

events
equally
unexpected

important
the

and
any

of

worthy
of
quotation
as
serving
to
show
that

animated
with
the

public

solemnity
their
labors
were
commenced
with

an
act
of
association
was
then
passed
though
not
without
considerable
opposition
this
act
ran
as
follows
the
actual
commencement
of
hostilities
against
this
continent
by
the
british
troops
in
the
bloody
scene
of
the
of
april
last
near
boston
the
increase
of
arbitrary
imposition
from
a
wicked
and
despotic
ministry
and
the
dread
of
insurrections
in
the
colonies
are
causes
sufficient
to
drive
an
oppressed
people
to
the
use
of
arms

therefore
the

holding
ourselves
bound
by
that
most
sacred
of
all

the

of
good

to
an
injured

thoroughly
convinced
that
under
our
present
distressed
circumstances
we
shall
be
justified
before
god

man
in
resisting

by

do

ourselves
under

this
open
declaration
was
followed
up
with
measures
equally
fearless
and
decisive
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
session
the
provincial
congress
resolved
to
raise
fifteen
hundred
infantry
rank
and
file
in
two
regiments
and
four
hundred
and
fifty
horse
constituting
another
regiment
the
troops
so
to
be
raised
were
to
be
subjected
to
military
discipline
and
to
the
articles
of
war
in
like
manner
with
the
british
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
their
session
a
million
of
money
was
voted
and
a
council
of
safety
was
elected
vested
with
the
executive
power
of
the

among
other
acts
of
this
body
to

were
made
amenable
to
the
general
committee
and
punishable
according
to
sound
policy
absentees
having
estates
were
with
certain
exceptions
required
to
return
and
it
was
further
resolved
that
no
persons
ought
to
withdraw
from
the
service
of
the
colony
without
giving
good
and
sufficient
reasons
to
the
provincial
congress
military
duty
was
performed
day
and
night
as
in
a
state
of
actual
warfare
by
the
militia
companies
in
rotation
and
thus
having
placed
the
province
in
a
state
of
preparation
with
arms
in
the
hands
of
the
people
and
given
to
the
newly
arrived
governor
lord
william
campbell
a
reception
which
boded
small
repose
to
his
authority
the
provincial
congress
adjourned
itself
on
the
day
of
june
leaving
their
authority
in
great
part
to
the
council
of
safety
and
general
committee
it
has
been
seen
that
the
only
share
which
marion
had
in
the
proceedings
of
this
body
was
that
of
an
assenting
member
he
was
not
endowed
with
those
talents
which
could
have
rendered
him
conspicuous
in
a
deliberative
assembly
but
he
is
not
the
less
entitled
to
his
share
in
the
merit
of
those
proceedings
which
so
admirably
declared
and
illustrated
the
patriotism
and
the
spirit
of
the
province
and
one
of
the
last
decisive
measures
of
the
provincial
congress
happily
enabled
him
to
appear
in
the
character
upon
which
he
was
more
likely
to
confer
distinction
than
that
of
the
orator
he
was
elected
a
captain
in
the
second
regiment
of
which
william
moultrie
formerly
his
captain
in
the
cherokee
campaign
was
made
colonel
the
duties
of
this
appointment
were
immediately
begun
with
a
promptness
at
once
due
to
the
necessities
of
the
case
and
his
own
character
as
a
proof
of
the
zeal
by
which
the
newly
made
officers
were
distinguished
we
find
them
seeking
recruits
so
early
as
the
of
june
and
while
the
body
to
which
they
belonged
were
still
engaged
in
the
most
laborious
duties
of
the
session
drayton
memoirs
vol
marion
commission
was
made
out
on
the
june
weems
in
his
life
of
our
subject
gives
us
some
pictures
equally
lively
and
ludicrous
of
his
progress
in
the
business
of
recruiting
upon
which
in
connection
with
his
friend
captain
horry
he
at
once
begun
this
gentleman
received
his
appointment
as
captain
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
regiment
with
marion
the
provincial
congress
had
voted
a
million
of
money
by
which
to
carry
out
their
measures
but
this
was
yet
to
be
procured
and
as
it
appears
rather
more
upon
the
credit
of
individuals
than
that
of
the
colony
but
money
in
times
of
danger
seems
to
have
an
instinct
of
its
own
by
which
it
hides
itself
readily
from
sight
and
touch
it
was
no
easy
matter
for
our
captains
to
obtain
the
requisite
sums
but
faith
and
zeal
did
more
for
them
and
for
the
cause
than
gold
and
silver
and
with
very
inadequate
supplies
but
in
fresh
and
showy
uniforms
our
young
officers
set
forth
on
the
recruiting
service
their
route
lay
in
the
several
neighborhoods
of
georgetown
black
river
and
the
great
pedee
in
these
parts
both
of
them
were
known
here
indeed
marion
was
already
a
favorite
accordingly
they
succeeded
beyond
their
expectations
and
were
soon
enabled
to
complete
the
full
number
for
their
two
companies
of
fifty
men
each
another
circumstance
apart
from
their
personal
popularity
probably
facilitated
their
objects
some
of
the
settlements
into
which
they
penetrated
were
originally
founded
by
the
irish
the
bitter
heritage
of
hate
to
the
english
which
they
brought
with
them
to
america
was
transmitted
with
undiminished
fervor
to
their
descendants
it
was
easy
to
show
that
the
power
which
had
trampled
upon
the
affections
of
their
fathers
and
tyrannized
over
their
rights
in
the
old
world
was
aiming
at
the
same
objects
in
the
case
of
their
children
in
the
new
at
one
remove
only
from
the
exiled
and
suffering
generation
the
sons
had
as
lively
a
recollection
of
the
tyrannies
of
britain
as
if
the
experience
had
been
immediately
their
own
to
this
cause
our
recruiting
officers
owed
some
of
their
success
in
the
present
expedition
some
of
the
bravest
fellows
of
the
second
regiment
were
picked
up
on
this
occasion
it
was
the
spirit
which
they
brought
and
to
which
the
genius
of
marion
gave
lively
exercise
that
imparted
a
peculiar
vitality
at
all
times
to
his
little
brigade
among
these
gallant
young
men
there
were
two
in
particular
of
whom
tradition
in
carolina
will
long
retain
a
grateful
recollection
these
were
jasper
and
macdonald
of
these
two
both
of
whom
sealed
their
patriotism
with
their
blood
we
shall
yet
have
something
further
to
deliver
while
the
friends
of
liberty
were
thus
active
the
adherents
of
the
crown
in
the
colony
were
not
less
so
these
in
many
parts
of
the
country
were
equally
numerous
and
influential
they
possessed
indeed
certain
advantages
in
the
discussion
which
in
some
degree
served
to
counterbalance
the
impelling
and
stimulating
influences
which
always
belong
to
a
party
they
carried
with
them
the
prestige
of
authority
of
the
venerable
power
which
time
and
custom
seemed
to
hallow
they
appealed
to
the
loyalty
of
the
subject
they
dwelt
upon
the
dangers
which
came
with
innovation
they
denounced
the
ambition
of
the
patriot
leaders
they
reminded
the
people
of
the
power
of
great
britain
a
power
to
save
or
to
destroy
which
had
so
frequently
and
so
successfully
been
exerted
in
their
behalf
in
their
numerous
and
bloody
conflicts
with
the
indians
and
which
might
be
brought
with
such
fearful
emphasis
upon
their
own
heads
they
reminded
the
people
that
the
indians
were
not
exterminated
that
they
still
hung
in
numerous
hordes
about
the
frontiers
and
that
it
needed
but
a
single
word
from
the
crown
to
bring
them
once
more
with
tomahawk
and
upon
their
defenceless
homes
already
indeed
had
the
emissaries
of
great
britain
taken
measures
to
this
end
the
savage
was
already
shaking
off
his
apathy
scenting
the
carnage
from
afar
and
making
ready
for
the
onset
the
assurance
that
such
was
the
case
was
doing
the
work
of
numerous
arguments
among
the
timid
and
the
exposed
such
were
the
suggestions
appealing
equally
to
their
fears
and
gratitude
which
the
leading
loyalists
addressed
to
the
people
they
were
supported
by
other
suggestions
scarcely
less
potent
which
naturally
flowed
from
their
own
thoughts
why
should
they
dare
the
conflict
with
great
britain
there
was
no
such
reason
for
it
as
in
the
case
of
the
northern
colonies
they
had
known
her
chiefly
by
benefactions
they
did
not
conflict
with
her
in
shipping
or
in
manufactures
and
the
arguments
for
discontent
and
resistance
as
urged
by
the
patriot
leaders
did
not
reach
them
with
sufficient
force
what
was
the
tax
on
tea
of
which
they
drank
little
and
the
duty
on
stamps
when
they
had
but
little
need
for
legal
papers
and
why
should
not
taxes
follow
protection
which
great
britain
had
not
often
withheld
in
the
need
of
a
favorite
colony
as
south
carolina
had
unquestionably
been
let
us
do
justice
to
this
people
the
loyalists
or
as
they
were
more
commonly
called
and
as
we
shall
hereafter
be
compelled
to
call
them
the
tories
were
probably
in
the
majority
of
cases
governed
by
principle
by
a
firm
and
settled
conviction
after
deliberate
examination
of
the
case
that
they
might
have
thought
otherwise
nay
would
gradually
have
adopted
the
opinions
of
the
patriots
is
not
improbable
had
more
time
been
allowed
them
and
had
the
course
of
the
latter
been
more
indulgent
and
considerate
unfortunately
this
was
not
the
case
and
the
desire
to
coerce
where
they
could
not
easily
convince
had
the
effect
of
making
a
determined
and
deadly
out
of
a
doubtful
foe
this
was
terribly
proved
by
the
after
history
to
this
cause
we
may
ascribe
in
some
degree
the
terrors
of
that
sanguinary
strife
in
which
to
use
the
language
of
a
distinguished
officer
they
pursued
each
other
rather
like
wild
beasts
than
men
we
shall
see
something
of
this
history
as
we
proceed
in
ours
letter
of
general
greene
see
johnson
there
was
yet
another
circumstance
which
tended
in
some
degree
to
give
courage
to
the
tories
it
was
the
somewhat
temporizing
policy
of
the
patriots
there
was
still
a
feeling
of
doubt
a
hesitancy
on
the
part
of
the
latter
as
the
prospects
grew
stronger
of
a
final
breach
with
great
britain
there
were
many
who
still
clung
to
the
hope
that
the
differences
of
the
two
nations
might
yet
be
reconciled
and
though
the
means
of
such
reconciliation
did
not
make
themselves
obvious
they
yet
fondly
cherished
the
conviction
that
something
might
turn
up
at
the
last
moment
to
prevent
the
absolute
necessity
of
bloodshed
this
portion
of
the
patriots
necessarily
influenced
the
rest
those
who
looking
beyond
the
moment
saw
the
true
issue
and
properly
regarded
the
declared
objects
of
difference
as
pretexts
which
must
suffice
when
the
better
reasons
might
not
be
expressed
they
dared
not
openly
broach
the
idea
of
national
independence
which
there
is
very
little
question
that
the
noblest
of
the
american
patriots
everywhere
though
secretly
entertained
from
the
beginning
the
people
were
not
prepared
for
such
a
revelation
such
a
condition
and
appearances
were
still
to
be
maintained
their
proceedings
accordingly
still
wore
however
loosely
a
pacific
aspect
though
actively
preparing
for
war
the
professions
of
the
patriots
declared
their
measures
to
be
precautionary
only
a
refuge
an
alternative
in
the
event
of
greater
oppression
they
still
spoke
the
language
of
loyalty
still
dealt
in
vague
assurances
of
devotion
to
the
crown
but
such
professions
deceived
nobody
and
least
of
all
the
loyalists
they
derived
courage
from
the
reluctance
of
the
patriots
to
embark
in
a
struggle
for
the
fruits
of
which
if
successful
they
evidently
longed
they
were
not
less
active
nay
in
the
interior
they
were
even
more
active
than
their
opponents
had
already
taken
arms
and
gained
advantages
which
nothing
but
decisive
movements
on
the
part
of
the
people
along
the
seaboard
could
possibly
induce
them
to
forego
this
necessity
was
apparent
for
other
reasons
in
consequence
of
the
temporizing
policy
already
mentioned
the
crown
was
still
in
possession
of
most
of
the
shows
of
power
in
and
about
charleston
the
royal
governor
was
still
in
the
city
and
in
some
degree
exerting
his
authority
fort
johnson
on
james
island
was
suffered
to
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
king
troops
for
more
than
three
months
after
the
provincial
congress
had
ordered
a
levy
of
troops
and
had
resolved
on
taking
up
arms
two
british
armed
vessels
the
tamar
and
cherokee
lay
in
rebellion
roads
opposite
sullivan
island
this
force
was
quite
sufficient
under
existing
circumstances
to
have
destroyed
the
town
but
the
royal
leaders
were
not
prepared
for
this
issue
they
shared
the
reluctance
of
the
patriots
to
begin
a
conflict
the
issues
of
which
were
so
extreme
their
policy
like
that
of
the
patriots
influencing
it
and
possibly
influenced
by
it
was
equally
halting
and
indecisive
it
was
sufficiently
satisfactory
if
by
the
presence
of
such
a
force
the
citizens
should
be
overawed
and
kept
from
action
this
condition
of
things
could
not
continue
the
very
nature
of
the
movement
was
adverse
to
indecision
it
needed
but
a
first
step
a
first
stroke
and
this
was
to
be
taken
by
the
patriots
they
brooked
impatiently
the
humiliating
position
in
which
the
city
stood
controlled
by
an
inferior
enemy
and
it
was
resolved
that
fort
johnson
should
be
subdued
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
marion
first
drew
his
sword
against
the
british
he
was
one
of
those
captains
who
with
their
companies
were
dispatched
on
this
expedition
the
command
was
given
to
moultrie
a
strong
resistance
was
expected
as
but
a
short
time
before
the
garrison
had
been
reinforced
from
the
armed
vessels
at
midnight
on
the
fourteenth
of
september
the
detachment
crossed
to
james
island
the
disembarkation
was
effected
with
delay
and
difficulty
occasioned
by
the
inadequate
size
and
number
of
the
boats
the
forlorn
hope
consisting
of
a
detachment
from
the
grenadiers
of
capt
pinckney
joined
by
the
cadets
and
led
by
lieut
mouatt
were
to
scale
the
walls
of
the
fort
on
its
south
bastion
moultrie
with
the
rest
of
pinckney
grenadiers
and
marion
light
infantry
were
to
enter
or
force
the
gates
over
the
ravelin
while
capt
elliott
with
his
grenadiers
penetrated
the
lower
battery
over
the
left
flank
it
was
broad
daylight
before
the
landing
was
effected
and
on
making
the
assault
they
were
surprised
by
an
easy
victory
the
fort
was
abandoned
the
enemy
had
probably
been
apprised
of
the
attack
a
detachment
from
the
ships
had
landed
some
hours
before
had
dismantled
the
fort
dismounted
the
cannon
and
withdrawn
the
garrison
retreating
in
safety
to
the
ships
a
gunner
and
three
men
only
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
provincials
the
very
day
that
this
event
occurred
lord
william
campbell
the
governor
fled
to
the
tamar
sloop
of
war
his
flight
was
no
doubt
hastened
by
a
proceeding
so
decisive
that
evening
he
dispatched
his
secretary
to
fort
johnson
which
he
was
not
permitted
to
enter
he
was
met
at
the
by
capt
pinckney
of
whom
he
demanded
in
the
name
of
the
governor
by
what
authority
he
had
taken
and
held
possession
of
the
fortress
the
answer
to
this
demand
brought
up
the
vessels
of
war
which
on
the
seventeenth
of
september
presented
themselves
within
point
blank
shot
of
the
fort
up
to
this
time
but
three
of
the
dismantled
cannon
had
been
remounted
and
put
in
order
for
action
with
these
the
provincials
prepared
for
battle
relying
however
less
upon
their
cannon
than
upon
their
ability
to
oppose
the
landing
of
any
body
of
men
but
the
demonstration
of
the
squadron
was
without
fruits
they
hauled
off
without
a
shot
and
resumed
their
former
less
offensive
position
here
however
the
popular
leaders
were
not
disposed
to
suffer
them
to
remain
still
they
hesitated
at
coming
to
blows
they
adopted
a
middle
course
which
in
such
cases
is
generally
the
worst
they
ordered
that
the
ships
should
not
be
victualled
or
supplied
with
water
from
the
city
except
from
day
to
day
this
produced
a
threat
from
captain
thornborough
that
unless
supplied
as
before
he
should
prevent
the
ingress
or
departure
of
any
vessel
from
the
harbor
a
menace
of
this
kind
to
have
been
properly
met
should
have
been
answered
from
the
eighteen
pounders
of
fort
johnson
and
but
for
the
reluctance
of
several
highly
esteemed
patriots
such
would
have
been
the
mode
of
answer
this
temporizing
policy
continued
to
prevail
until
the
november
when
the
provincial
congress
resolved
by
every
military
operation
to
oppose
the
passage
of
any
british
armament
such
were
the
orders
issued
to
the
officer
commanding
at
fort
johnson
this
fort
had
now
been
in
possession
of
the
popular
party
for
nearly
two
months
it
was
in
some
degree
prepared
for
use
it
was
well
manned
with
a
portion
of
those
brave
fellows
who
afterwards
fought
the
good
fight
of
fort
sullivan
they
would
have
done
as
good
service
here
the
resolution
of
the
province
once
adopted
it
was
communicated
as
well
to
the
commanders
of
the
british
vessels
as
to
the
officers
of
the
fort
there
was
still
an
open
passage
through
channel
by
which
the
british
vessels
might
approach
the
town
without
incurring
any
danger
from
the
fort
this
passage
it
was
determined
to
obstruct
and
an
armed
schooner
called
the
defence
fitted
up
for
the
occasion
was
ordered
to
cover
and
protect
a
party
which
was
employed
to
sink
a
number
of
hulks
in
that
narrow
strait
this
drew
upon
them
the
fire
of
the
british
it
was
returned
by
the
defence
but
with
little
injury
to
either
side
the
garrison
at
fort
johnson
endeavored
to
take
part
in
this
little
action
but
the
distance
was
too
great
for
any
decisive
results
from
its
fire
some
of
the
shots
took
effect
but
after
a
few
rounds
the
fire
was
discontinued
meanwhile
the
alarm
was
beat
in
charleston
where
the
troops
stood
to
their
arms
and
every
heart
throbbed
with
the
expectation
of
a
close
and
bloody
fight
but
the
time
was
not
yet
indecisive
in
itself
this
brief
combat
was
of
great
importance
in
one
point
of
view
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
game
the
blow
for
which
all
parties
had
been
waiting
was
now
fairly
struck
the
sword
had
been
drawn
from
the
scabbard
not
again
to
be
sheathed
till
the
struggle
was
concluded
the
local
congress
proceeded
vigorously
ships
were
impressed
for
the
purpose
of
war
new
troops
were
enlisted
and
armed
and
bills
of
credit
issued
the
british
vessels
meanwhile
became
more
than
ever
troublesome
and
carrying
out
the
menace
of
captain
thornborough
proceeded
to
the
seizure
of
all
vessels
within
their
reach
whether
going
from
or
returning
to
the
port
it
became
necessary
to
drive
them
from
the
roadstead
to
effect
this
moultrie
with
a
party
of
newly
raised
provincials
and
the
charleston
artillery
took
post
on
haddrill
point
and
mounting
a
few
pieces
of
heavy
artillery
opened
upon
them
with
a
fire
which
drove
them
out
to
sea
this
step
was
followed
by
one
of
preparation
the
fortifications
at
fort
johnson
and
point
were
completed
the
city
was
fortified
a
new
fort
was
raised
on
james
and
another
begun
on
sullivan
island
the
militia
were
diligently
trained
the
provincial
troops
augmented
and
disciplined
and
all
means
within
the
power
of
the
colony
were
put
in
requisition
to
prepare
it
for
defence
among
other
preparations
a
military
post
was
established
at
the
town
of
dorchester
and
strongly
fortified
this
post
was
nearly
at
the
head
of
navigation
on
ashley
river
about
twenty
miles
from
charleston
though
now
utterly
desolate
dorchester
was
prior
to
the
revolution
a
town
of
considerable
population
and
importance
its
abandonment
may
be
ascribed
to
the
revolution
during
which
it
was
maintained
as
a
military
post
by
the
americans
or
british
to
this
place
the
public
stores
and
records
were
in
great
part
transferred
from
charleston
as
to
a
place
of
the
command
was
given
to
marion
while
in
this
command
we
do
not
find
the
occurrence
of
any
events
of
importance
a
couple
of
his
original
letters
dated
from
this
post
lie
before
us
they
refer
only
to
ordinary
events
but
contain
some
expressions
which
denote
the
ardency
of
his
patriotism
and
the
disappointments
to
which
it
was
not
unfrequently
subjected
in
consequence
of
the
apathy
of
others
referring
to
the
reluctance
shown
by
many
of
whom
the
utmost
patriotism
was
expected
to
rally
around
the
flag
of
the
country
he
exclaims
in
a
partial
perversion
of
scripture
language
but
without
irreverence
tell
this
not
in
the
streets
of
charleston
from
this
post
marion
was
removed
to
charleston
very
probably
at
his
own
solicitation
events
were
ripening
in
that
quarter
of
a
nature
calculated
to
give
becoming
employment
to
a
mind
always
active
and
desiring
nothing
more
than
to
serve
his
country
from
charleston
he
was
dispatched
to
fort
johnson
where
he
was
busily
employed
in
completing
the
defences
of
that
place
weems
preserves
an
anecdote
of
him
while
in
command
of
this
fort
in
january
which
pleasantly
describes
the
quiet
and
not
unamiable
sort
of
humor
in
which
marion
was
frequently
said
to
indulge
while
exceedingly
busy
in
his
preparations
for
defence
there
came
to
him
a
thoughtless
young
officer
who
loved
the
cockpit
much
better
than
consisted
entirely
with
his
duties
christmas
and
new
year
holidays
were
famous
at
that
early
period
for
the
exercise
of
this
cruel
sport
in
some
parts
of
carolina
to
obtain
leave
of
absence
however
on
any
holiday
pretence
the
young
officer
very
well
knew
was
impossible
approaching
his
commander
with
a
lie
in
his
mouth
he
obtained
the
desired
permission
in
order
to
receive
the
last
blessing
of
a
dying
father
and
exulting
in
the
unworthy
artifice
he
hurried
to
dorchester
which
on
that
occasion
was
to
be
the
scene
of
his
recreation
during
his
absence
marion
arrived
at
the
truth
of
the
story
but
said
nothing
when
the
youth
returned
which
he
did
after
two
weeks
absence
he
proceeded
to
the
marquee
of
his
commander
to
report
himself
and
began
a
tedious
apology
for
having
stayed
so
long
marion
gently
interrupted
him
and
with
a
smile
in
the
presence
of
all
the
officers
replied
never
mind
it
lieutenant
there
no
harm
done
we
never
missed
you
the
effect
of
this
sarcasm
is
said
to
have
been
admirable
and
to
have
resulted
in
the
complete
reform
of
the
offender
who
from
being
a
trifling
purposeless
and
unscrupulous
young
man
grew
considerate
equally
of
his
duties
and
his
word
and
by
a
career
of
industry
sobriety
and
modesty
made
ample
amends
in
future
days
for
all
the
errors
of
the
past
with
the
formation
of
new
regiments
under
the
resolves
of
the
council
of
safety
marion
was
promoted
to
a
majority
this
appointment
materially
enlarged
the
sphere
of
his
duties
but
he
was
one
of
those
remarkable
men
who
without
pretension
prove
themselves
equal
to
any
trust
which
may
be
imposed
upon
them
without
the
presence
of
an
actual
enemy
he
addressed
himself
to
the
task
of
preparing
his
men
for
the
encounter
with
them
he
was
constantly
on
parade
at
the
drill
closely
engaged
in
the
work
of
training
in
which
business
while
very
gentle
he
was
very
exact
and
in
such
a
degree
had
he
improved
the
officers
and
men
immediately
under
his
charge
that
they
were
very
soon
regarded
as
a
model
for
all
the
rest
he
was
called
the
architect
of
the
second
regiment
weems
speaking
for
horry
says
indeed
i
am
not
afraid
to
say
that
marion
was
the
architect
of
the
second
regiment
and
laid
the
foundation
of
that
excellent
discipline
and
confidence
in
themselves
which
gained
them
such
reputation
whenever
they
were
brought
to
face
their
enemies
the
value
of
this
training
was
very
soon
to
be
subjected
to
the
most
thorough
of
all
possible
tests
he
was
ordered
with
his
regiment
under
command
of
wm
moultrie
to
take
post
at
fort
sullivan
on
the
island
of
that
name
which
stands
at
the
entrance
of
charleston
harbor
and
within
point
blank
shot
of
the
channel
the
difficulties
and
deficiencies
of
this
post
furnished
some
admirable
preparatory
lessons
for
the
great
conflict
which
was
to
follow
they
imposed
the
necessity
of
diligent
industry
and
hard
labor
equally
on
men
and
soldiers
this
was
one
of
the
famous
schools
of
roman
discipline
fort
sullivan
better
known
as
fort
moultrie
was
yet
to
be
built
when
the
second
regiment
entered
it
it
was
little
more
than
an
outline
its
shape
was
described
upon
the
sand
and
the
palmetto
rafts
lay
around
it
waiting
to
be
moulded
into
form
the
structure
was
an
inartificial
one
a
simple
wall
behind
which
young
beginners
might
train
guns
to
do
mischief
to
a
veteran
enemy
in
front
its
form
was
square
with
a
bastion
at
each
angle
sufficiently
large
when
finished
to
cover
a
thousand
men
it
was
built
of
logs
laid
one
upon
another
in
parallel
rows
at
a
distance
of
sixteen
feet
bound
together
at
frequent
intervals
with
timber
dovetailed
and
bolted
into
the
logs
the
spaces
between
were
filled
up
with
sand
the
merlons
were
walled
entirely
by
palmetto
logs
notched
into
one
another
at
the
angles
well
bolted
together
and
strengthened
with
pieces
of
massy
timber
such
was
the
plan
of
the
work
but
with
all
the
diligence
of
the
officers
and
all
the
industry
of
the
men
it
remained
unfinished
at
the
perilous
moment
when
a
powerful
british
fleet
appeared
before
its
walls
the
defence
was
confided
to
moultrie
the
force
under
his
command
was
four
hundred
and
men
rank
and
file
comprising
four
hundred
and
thirteen
of
the
second
regiment
of
infantry
and
of
the
fourth
regiment
of
artillery
the
whole
number
of
cannon
mounted
on
the
fortress
was
of
these
nine
were
french
six
english
eighteens
nine
twelve
and
seven
nine
pounders
weems
in
his
life
of
marion
represents
the
cannon
as
made
up
principally
of
and
pounders
but
the
official
accounts
are
as
i
have
given
them
see
drayton
memoirs
vol
pp
general
charles
lee
who
had
been
dispatched
by
the
continental
congress
to
take
command
of
the
army
of
the
south
would
have
abandoned
the
fortress
even
before
the
appearance
of
the
enemy
he
was
unwilling
in
such
a
position
to
abide
the
conflict
he
seems
naturally
enough
for
an
officer
brought
up
in
a
british
army
to
have
had
an
overweening
veneration
for
a
british
fleet
in
which
it
is
fortunate
for
the
country
that
the
carolinians
did
not
share
in
the
unfinished
condition
of
the
fort
which
really
presented
little
more
than
a
front
towards
the
sea
his
apprehensions
were
justifiable
and
could
the
fort
have
been
enfiladed
as
the
british
designed
it
certainly
would
have
been
untenable
from
the
moment
of
his
arrival
to
the
very
moment
when
the
action
was
raging
his
chief
solicitude
seems
to
have
been
to
ensure
the
defenders
of
the
fortress
a
safe
retreat
it
is
to
their
immortal
honor
that
this
mortifying
measure
was
unnecessary
on
the
of
june
a
day
ever
memorable
in
the
annals
of
carolina
the
british
ships
of
war
nine
in
number
commanded
by
sir
peter
parker
drew
up
abreast
of
the
fort
let
go
their
anchors
with
springs
upon
their
cables
and
commenced
a
terrible
bombardment
the
famous
battle
which
followed
makes
one
of
the
brightest
pages
in
our
history
its
events
however
are
too
generally
known
to
make
it
necessary
that
we
should
dwell
upon
them
here
a
few
however
belong
properly
and
especially
to
our
pages
the
subject
of
this
memoir
was
a
conspicuous
sharer
in
its
dangers
and
in
its
honors
the
fire
of
the
enemy
was
promptly
answered
and
with
such
efficiency
of
aim
as
to
be
long
remembered
by
the
survivors
having
but
five
thousand
pounds
of
powder
with
which
to
maintain
a
conflict
that
raged
for
eleven
hours
with
unabated
violence
it
became
necessary
not
only
that
the
discharge
from
the
fort
should
be
timed
but
that
every
shot
should
be
made
to
do
execution
in
order
to
do
this
the
guns
were
trained
by
the
in
person
hence
perhaps
the
terrible
fatality
of
their
fire
the
bristol
gun
ship
commodore
sir
peter
parker
lost
men
killed
and
wounded
sir
peter
himself
lost
an
arm
the
experiment
another
gun
ship
had
killed
and
wounded
to
these
two
vessels
in
particular
the
attention
of
the
fort
was
directed
the
words
passed
along
the
line
by
officers
and
men
were
look
to
the
commodore
look
to
the
fifty
gun
ships
the
smaller
vessels
suffered
comparatively
little
their
loss
of
men
was
small
the
injury
to
the
vessels
themselves
was
greater
and
one
of
them
the
acteon
run
aground
and
was
subsequently
burnt
the
carolinians
lost
but
twelve
men
killed
and
twice
that
number
wounded
one
of
the
former
was
the
brave
fellow
macdonald
of
whom
we
have
already
spoken
when
borne
from
the
embrasure
where
he
received
his
mortal
wound
he
cried
out
to
those
around
him
do
not
give
up
you
are
fighting
for
liberty
and
country
the
want
of
powder
was
severely
felt
but
for
this
judging
from
the
effects
of
the
fire
from
the
fort
the
british
commodore
must
have
struck
or
his
fleet
must
have
been
destroyed
so
slow
at
one
time
were
the
discharges
so
great
the
interval
of
time
between
them
that
the
british
were
of
opinion
that
the
place
was
abandoned
but
a
new
supply
of
powder
was
obtained
by
marion
who
with
a
small
party
leaving
the
fort
proceeded
to
the
armed
schooner
defence
lying
in
stop
gap
creek
and
seized
upon
her
powder
by
which
the
fire
was
kept
up
until
a
supply
of
five
hundred
weight
was
received
from
the
city
this
caused
a
renewal
of
the
conflict
in
all
its
fury
the
garrison
fought
with
a
coolness
which
would
have
done
honor
to
veterans
the
day
was
very
warm
and
the
men
partially
stripped
to
it
moultrie
says
when
the
action
begun
it
being
a
warm
day
some
of
the
men
took
off
their
coats
and
threw
them
upon
the
top
of
the
merlons
i
saw
a
shot
take
one
of
them
and
throw
it
into
a
small
tree
behind
the
platform
it
was
noticed
by
our
men
and
they
cried
out
look
at
the
coat
a
little
incident
that
speaks
volumes
for
their
coolness
moultrie
himself
and
several
of
his
officers
smoked
their
pipes
during
the
action
only
removing
them
when
it
became
necessary
to
issue
orders
in
the
hottest
fire
of
the
battle
the
flag
of
the
fort
was
shot
away
and
fell
without
the
fort
jasper
with
whom
we
have
already
brought
the
reader
acquainted
as
one
of
marion
men
instantly
sprang
after
it
upon
the
beach
between
the
ramparts
and
the
enemy
and
binding
it
to
a
sponge
staff
restored
it
to
its
place
and
succeeded
in
regaining
his
own
in
safety
we
shall
hear
more
hereafter
of
this
gallant
fellow
the
coolness
nay
the
cavalier
indifference
displayed
by
the
carolinians
throughout
the
combat
is
not
its
least
remarkable
feature
there
is
something
chivalric
in
such
deportment
which
speaks
for
larger
courage
than
belongs
to
ordinary
valor
mere
resolution
and
endurance
is
here
lifted
by
a
generous
ardor
of
soul
into
something
other
than
a
passive
virtue
the
elasticity
of
spirit
which
it
shows
might
be
trained
to
any
performance

the

sergeant
jasper
of
the
grenadiers
leapt
over
the
ramparts
and
deliberately
walked
the
whole
length
of
the

until
he
came
to
the
colors
on
the
extremity
of
the

when
he
cut
off
the

from
the

called
to
me
for
a

with
a
thick
cord
tied
on

on

received
no

governor
rutledge
after
the

as
a
reward
took
his
small
sword
from

and
in

of

officers
presented
it
to
sergeant
jasper
telling
him
to
wear
it
in
remembrance
of
the
june
and
in
remembrance
of
him
he
also
offered
jasper
a
lieutenant
commission
but
as
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
he
modestly
refused
to
accept
it
saying
was
not

life

pp
tradition
ascribes
to
the
hand
and
eye
of
marion
the
terrible
effect
of
the
last
shot
which
was
fired
on
this
bloody
day
it
was
aimed
at
the
commodore
ship
which
had
already
received
something
more
than
her
due
share
of
the
attention
of
the
fort
this
shot
penetrating
the
cabin
of
the
vessel
cut
down
two
young
officers
who
were
drinking
we
may
suppose
to
their
fortunate
escape
from
a
conflict
which
seemed
already
over
then
ranging
forward
swept
three
sailors
from
the
maindeck
into
eternity
and
finally
buried
itself
in
the
bosom
of
the
sea
this
curious
particular
was
derived
from
five
sailors
who
deserted

from
the
battle
of

anecdote
of
jasper
his
death
the
battle
of
fort
sullivan
was
of
immense
importance
not
merely
to
carolina
but
to
all
the
confederated
colonies
it
saved
the
former
for
three
years
from
the
calamities
of
invasion
a
respite
of
the
last
value
to
a
country
so
greatly
divided
in
public
feeling
and
opinion
the
battle
preceded
the
declaration
of
independence
and
though
not
generally
known
to
have
taken
place
before
that
decisive
measure
was
resolved
upon
it
came
seasonably
to
confirm
the
patriots
in
those
principles
which
they
had
so
solemnly
and
recently
avowed
its
farther
effect
was
to
dissipate
that
spell
of
invincibility
which
in
the
minds
of
the
americans
seemed
to
hover
about
a
british
armament
to
heighten
the
courage
of
the
militia
and
to
convince
the
most
sceptical
that
it
needed
only
confidence
and
practice
to
make
the
american
people
as
good
soldiers
as
any
in
the
world
the
carolina
riflemen
were
not
a
little
elated
to
discover
that
they
could
handle
pounders
as
efficiently
as
the
smaller
implements
of
death
to
which
their
hands
were
better
accustomed
to
the
defenders
of
the
fortress
their
victory
brought
imperishable
laurels
they
had
shown
the
courage
and
the
skill
of
veterans
and
their
countrymen
gloried
in
the
reputation
in
which
they
necessarily
shared
moultrie
received
the
thanks
of
congress
of
the
and
of
his
fellow
citizens
the
fort
was
thenceforth
called
by
his
name
and
he
was
made
a
his
major
marion
necessarily
had
his
share
in
these
public
honors
and
was
raised
by
congress
to
the
rank
of
in
the
regular
service
two
days
after
the
battle
general
lee
reviewed
the
garrison
at
fort
moultrie
and
thanked
them
for
their
gallant
defence
of
the
fort
against
a
fleet
of
eight
and
a
bomb
during
a
cannonade
of
eleven
hours
and
a
bombardment
of
seven
at
the
same
time
barnard
elliott
presented
an
elegant
pair
of
embroidered
colors
to
the
second
regiment
with
a
brief
address
in
which
she
expressed
her
conviction
that
they
would
stand
by
them
as
long
as
they
can
wave
in
the
air
of
liberty
it
was
in
fulfilling
the
pledge
made
by
general
moultrie
on
this
occasion
in
behalf
of
the
regiment
that
the
brave
jasper
lost
his
life
before
the
walls
of
savannah
the
three
years
respite
from
the
horrors
of
war
which
this
victory
secured
to
carolina
was
not
however
left
unemployed
by
her
citizen
soldiery
the
progress
of
events
around
them
kept
their
services
in
constant
requisition
while
a
part
of
them
in
the
interior
were
compelled
to
take
arms
against
the
cherokee
indians
the
troops
of
the
lower
country
were
required
against
the
tories
in
florida
and
georgia
governor
tonyn
of
the
former
an
active
loyalist
proved
a
formidable
annoyance
to
the
patriots
of
the
latter
province
florida
under
his
administration
was
the
secure
refuge
and
certain
retreat
for
all
the
malcontents
and
outlaws
of
the
neighboring
colonies
he
gave
them
ample
encouragement
put
arms
into
their
hands
and
even
issued
letters
of
marque
against
the
property
of
the
colonists
in
anticipation
of
the
act
for
that
purpose
in
the
british
parliament
general
lee
marched
upon
florida
with
the
virginia
and
north
carolina
troops
he
was
subsequently
joined
by
those
of
south
carolina
but
owing
to
his
own
and
improvident
movements
the
expedition
was
a
total
failure
this
result
necessarily
gave
encouragement
to
the
tories
and
though
in
too
small
numbers
to
effect
any
important
objects
without
the
cooperation
of
a
british
force
they
were
yet
sufficiently
active
to
invite
the
presence
of
one
they
formed
themselves
into
little
squads
and
moving
through
the
country
with
celerity
pursued
their
marauding
habits
at
little
risk
as
they
sought
only
unsuspecting
neighborhoods
and
promptly
fled
to
the
fastnesses
of
florida
on
the
approach
of
danger
to
direct
and
properly
avail
themselves
of
these
parties
the
british
commanders
in
america
addressed
their
attention
to
georgia
the
infancy
of
that
colony
necessarily
led
them
to
hope
for
an
easy
conquest
in
attempting
it
in
february
general
howe
then
commanding
the
troops
in
north
carolina
and
georgia
was
advised
of
the
approach
of
colonel
fuser
to
the
invasion
of
georgia
he
hurried
on
immediately
to
prepare
savannah
for
defence
while
marion
with
a
force
of
men
in
several
vessels
provided
with
cannon
and
ammunition
was
dispatched
by
the
inland
passage
to
his
assistance
marion
left
charleston
on
the
of
february
but
his
approach
had
no
farther
effect
than
to
precipitate
the
flight
of
the
enemy
who
meeting
with
a
stout
opposition
from
colonel
elbert
at
ogechee
ferry
had
already
desisted
from
farther
advance
the
british
attempts
on
georgia
were
deferred
to
a
later
period
but
the
loyalists
were
busy
particularly
that
portion
of
them
which
took
the
name
of
scopholites
after
one
scophol
a
militia
colonel
whom
moultrie
describes
as
an
illiterate
stupid
noisy
blockhead
he
proved
not
the
less
troublesome
because
of
his
stupidity
drayton
memoirs
vol
p
marion
was
more
or
less
employed
during
this
period
in
various
situations
he
was
never
unemployed
we
find
him
at
length
in
command
of
the
fort
which
he
had
formerly
contributed
to
defend
and
render
famous
he
was
placed
in
charge
of
the
garrison
at
fort
moultrie
the
value
of
this
fort
was
estimated
rather
according
to
its
celebrity
than
its
real
usefulness
subsequent
events
have
shown
that
its
capacity
was
not
great
in
retarding
the
approach
of
an
enemy
fleet
to
the
city
it
was
the
error
of
sir
peter
parker
obeying
an
old
but
exploded
military
maxim
not
to
leave
an
armed
post
of
the
enemy
in
his
rear
to
pause
before
a
fortress
the
conquest
of
which
could
in
no
wise
contribute
to
his
success
and
defeat
before
which
must
necessarily
endanger
his
final
objects
it
was
still
the
impression
of
the
carolinians
that
fort
moultrie
must
be
assailed
as
a
preliminary
step
to
the
conquest
of
charleston
and
the
post
as
one
of
the
highest
honor
and
danger
was
conferred
upon
marion
it
was
not
known
indeed
at
what
moment
the
gallantry
of
the
garrison
might
be
put
to
the
proof
the
british
were
known
to
be
making
large
marine
and
military
preparations
at
new
york
intended
as
it
was
generally
understood
for
the
south
charleston
or
savannah
were
supposed
indifferently
to
be
the
places
of
its
destination
it
might
be
very
well
supposed
that
the
enemy
would
seek
at
the
former
place
to
recover
those
honors
of
war
of
which
its
gallant
defenders
had
deprived
him
when
the
british
under
prevost
were
in
possession
of
the
neighboring
islands
moultrie
writes
we
were
apprehensive
the
enemy
would
attempt
to
surprise
fort
moultrie
we
therefore
always
kept
a
strong
garrison
there
under
general
marion
but
any
doubt
as
to
the
destination
of
the
british
fleet
was
soon
removed
in
december
sail
appeared
before
savannah
and
four
thousand
british
regulars
were
disembarked
the
american
force
left
in
defence
of
savannah
was
a
feeble
one
of
six
or
seven
hundred
men
under
general
howe
general
howe
was
but
little
of
a
soldier
instead
of
withdrawing
this
force
he
suffered
it
to
be
sacrificed
badly
posted
he
was
surprised
and
his
troops
beaten
and
dispersed
with
little
difficulty
savannah
fell
at
once
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
the
whole
colony
very
shortly
after
general
prevost
was
in
command
of
the
british
opposed
to
him
was
lincoln
of
the
continental
army
while
prevost
occupied
the
posts
of
savannah
ebenezer
abercorn
and
other
places
he
was
active
in
pushing
select
parties
forward
to
augusta
and
other
commanding
points
in
the
interior
the
force
under
lincoln
did
not
enable
him
to
offer
any
active
opposition
to
their
progress
his
headquarters
were
at
purysburg
on
the
savannah
river
but
a
few
miles
from
abercorn
where
colonel
campbell
lay
with
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
general
ashe
of
the
americans
occupied
the
post
at
brier
creek
and
thus
placed
the
opposing
commanders
seemed
disposed
for
a
while
to
rest
upon
their
arms
waiting
events
and
reinforcements
it
was
while
the
second
south
carolina
regiment
lay
at
purysburg
that
an
adventure
occurred
which
has
so
often
been
repeated
in
connection
with
the
name
and
life
of
marion
that
we
should
scarcely
be
excused
from
introducing
it
here
as
properly
in
place
in
this
memoir
weems
asserts
that
marion
was
present
at
this
time
with
his
regiment
at
purysburg
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
he
was
or
not
it
is
not
improbable
that
he
was
with
his
regiment
and
yet
the
weight
of
evidence
inclines
us
to
the
opinion
that
he
was
still
at
fort
moultrie
it
is
not
unlikely
however
that
when
the
direction
of
the
british
fleet
was
known
and
it
was
ascertained
that
savannah
and
not
charleston
was
its
object
he
immediately
joined
his
regiment
at
purysburg
leaving
fort
moultrie
in
the
charge
of
some
less
distinguished
officer
at
all
events
the
point
is
not
of
importance
to
the
anecdote
we
have
to
relate
personally
marion
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
was
only
because
the
actors
in
the
adventure
belonged
to
his
regiment
and
were
of
men
that
tradition
has
insisted
on
associating
his
name
with
theirs
it
is
not
for
us
to
have
it
otherwise
the
reader
is
already
somewhat
acquainted
with
the
name
of
william
jasper
perhaps
sergeant
jasper
is
the
better
known
this
brave
man
possessed
remarkable
talents
for
a
scout
he
could
wear
all
disguises
with
admirable
ease
and
dexterity
garden
styles
him
a
perfect
proteus
he
was
equally
remarkable
for
his
strategy
as
for
his
bravery
and
his
nobleness
and
generosity
were
quite
as
much
as
these
the
distinguishing
traits
of
his
character
such
was
the
confidence
in
his
fidelity
and
skill
that
a
roving
commission
was
granted
him
with
liberty
to
pick
his
associates
from
the
brigade
of
these
he
seldom
chose
more
than
six
he
often
went
out
says
moultrie
and
returned
with
prisoners
before
i
knew
that
he
was
gone
i
have
known
of
his
catching
a
party
that
was
looking
for
him
he
has
told
me
that
he
could
have
killed
single
men
several
times
but
he
would
not
he
would
rather
let
them
get
off
he
went
into
the
british
lines
at
savannah
as
a
deserter
complaining
at
the
same
time
of
our
of
him
he
was
gladly
received
they
having
heard
of
his
character
and
caressed
by
them
he
stayed
eight
days
and
after
informing
himself
well
of
their
strength
situation
and
intentions
he
returned
to
us
again
but
that
game
he
could
not
play
a
second
time
with
his
little
party
he
was
always
hovering
about
the
enemy
camp
and
was
frequently
bringing
in
prisoners
we
have
seen
what
reason
was
alleged
by
this
brave
fellow
for
not
accepting
the
commission
tendered
to
him
by
governor
rutledge
for
his
gallantry
in
the
battle
of
fort
moultrie
the
nature
of
his
services
was
no
less
a
reason
why
he
should
reject
the
commission
the
fact
that
he
seldom
allowed
himself
a
command
of
more
than
six
men
declared
sufficiently
the
degree
of
authority
to
which
he
thought
his
talents
were
entitled
he
was
a
perfect
proteus
in
ability
to
alter
his
appearance
perpetually
entering
the
camp
of
the
enemy
without
detection
and
invariably
returning
to
his
own
with
soldiers
he
had
seduced
or
prisoners
he
had
captured
moultrie
vol
p
it
was
while
in
the
exercise
of
his
roving
privileges
that
jasper
prepared
to
visit
the
post
of
the
enemy
at
ebenezer
at
this
post
he
had
a
brother
who
held
the
same
rank
in
the
british
service
that
he
held
in
the
american
this
instance
was
quite
too
common
in
the
history
of
the
period
and
country
to
occasion
much
surprise
or
cause
any
suspicion
of
the
integrity
of
either
party
we
have
already
considered
the
causes
for
this
melancholy
difference
of
individual
sentiment
in
the
country
and
need
not
dwell
upon
them
here
william
jasper
loved
his
brother
and
wished
to
see
him
it
is
very
certain
at
the
same
time
that
he
did
not
deny
himself
the
privilege
of
seeing
all
around
him
the
tory
was
alarmed
at
william
appearance
in
the
british
camp
but
the
other
quieted
his
fears
by
representing
himself
as
no
longer
an
american
soldier
he
checked
the
joy
which
this
declaration
excited
in
his
brother
mind
by
assuring
him
that
though
he
found
little
encouragement
in
fighting
for
his
country
he
had
not
the
heart
to
fight
against
her
our
scout
lingered
for
two
or
three
days
in
the
british
camp
and
then
by
a
regained
that
of
the
americans
reporting
to
his
commander
all
that
he
had
seen
he
was
encouraged
to
repeat
his
visit
a
few
weeks
after
but
this
time
he
took
with
him
a
comrade
one
sergeant
newton
a
fellow
quite
as
brave
in
spirit
and
strong
in
body
as
himself
here
he
was
again
well
received
by
his
brother
who
entertained
the
guests
kindly
for
several
days
meanwhile
a
small
party
of
americans
were
brought
into
ebenezer
as
captives
over
whom
hung
the
danger
of
short
shrift
and
sudden
cord
they
were
on
their
way
to
savannah
for
trial
they
had
taken
arms
with
the
british
as
hundreds
more
had
done
when
the
country
was
deemed
reconquered
but
on
the
approach
of
the
american
army
had
rejoined
their
countrymen
and
were
now
once
more
at
the
mercy
of
the
power
with
which
they
had
broken
faith
it
will
go
hard
with
them
said
the
tory
jasper
to
his
whig
brother
but
the
secret
comment
of
the
other
was
it
shall
go
hard
with
me
first
there
was
a
woman
the
wife
of
one
of
the
prisoners
who
with
her
child
kept
them
company
william
jasper
and
his
friend
were
touched
by
the
spectacle
of
their
distress
and
they
conferred
together
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
as
to
the
possibility
of
rescuing
them
their
plan
was
soon
adopted
it
was
a
simple
one
such
as
naturally
suggests
itself
to
a
hardy
and
magnanimous
character
the
prisoners
had
scarcely
left
the
post
for
savannah
under
a
guard
of
eight
men
a
sergeant
and
corporal
when
they
took
leave
of
their
host
and
set
forth
also
though
in
a
different
direction
from
the
guard
changing
their
course
when
secure
from
observation
they
stretched
across
the
country
and
followed
the
footsteps
of
the
unhappy
captives
but
it
was
only
in
the
pursuit
that
they
became
truly
conscious
of
the
difficulty
nay
seeming
impossibility
of
effecting
their
object
the
guard
was
armed
and
ten
in
number
they
but
two
and
weaponless
hopeless
they
nevertheless
followed
on
two
miles
from
savannah
there
is
a
famous
spring
the
waters
of
which
are
well
known
to
travellers
the
conjecture
that
the
guard
might
stop
there
with
the
prisoners
for
refreshment
suggested
itself
to
our
companions
here
opportunities
might
occur
for
the
rescue
which
had
nowhere
before
presented
themselves
taking
an
obscure
path
with
which
they
were
familiar
which
led
them
to
the
spot
before
the
enemy
could
arrive
they
placed
themselves
in
ambush
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
spring
they
had
not
long
to
wait
their
conjecture
proved
correct
the
guard
was
halted
on
the
road
opposite
the
spring
the
corporal
with
four
men
conducted
the
captives
to
the
water
while
the
sergeant
with
the
remainder
of
his
force
having
made
them
ground
their
arms
near
the
road
brought
up
the
rear
the
prisoners
threw
themselves
upon
the
earth
the
woman
and
her
child
near
its
father
little
did
any
of
them
dream
that
deliverance
was
at
hand
the
child
fell
asleep
in
the
mother
lap
two
of
the
armed
men
kept
guard
but
we
may
suppose
with
little
caution
what
had
they
to
apprehend
within
sight
of
a
walled
town
in
the
possession
of
their
friends
two
others
approached
the
spring
in
order
to
bring
water
to
the
prisoners
resting
their
muskets
against
a
tree
they
proceeded
to
fill
their
canteens
at
this
moment
jasper
gave
the
signal
to
his
comrade
in
an
instant
the
muskets
were
in
their
hands
in
another
they
had
shot
down
the
two
soldiers
upon
duty
then
clubbing
their
weapons
they
rushed
out
upon
the
astonished
enemy
and
felling
their
first
opponents
each
at
a
blow
they
succeeded
in
obtaining
possession
of
the
loaded
muskets
this
decided
the
conflict
which
was
over
in
a
few
minutes
the
surviving
guard
yielded
themselves
to
mercy
before
the
presented
weapons
such
an
achievement
could
only
be
successful
from
its
audacity
and
the
operation
of
circumstances
the
very
proximity
of
savannah
increased
the
chances
of
success
but
for
this
the
guard
would
have
taken
better
precautions
none
were
taken
the
prompt
valor
the
bold
decision
the
cool
calculation
of
the
instant
were
the
essential
elements
which
secured
success
the
work
of
our
young
heroes
was
not
done
imperfectly
the
prisoners
were
quickly
released
the
arms
of
the
captured
british
put
into
their
hands
and
hurrying
away
from
the
spot
which
they
have
crowned
with
a
local
celebrity
not
soon
to
be
forgotten
they
crossed
the
savannah
in
safety
with
their
friends
and
foes
this
is
not
the
last
achievement
of
the
brave
jasper
which
we
shall
have
occasion
to
record
the
next
however
though
not
less
distinguished
by
success
was
unhappily
written
in
his
own
blood
the
campaign
which
followed
was
distinguished
by
several
vicissitudes
but
the
general
result
was
the
weakening
and
dispiriting
of
the
american
forces
brigadier
general
ashe
was
surprised
in
his
camp
and
utterly
defeated
and
the
british
army
not
only
penetrated
into
georgia
but
made
its
appearance
at
beaufort
in
south
carolina
here
it
was
met
by
moultrie
in
a
spirited
encounter
which
resulted
in
a
drawn
battle
meanwhile
general
lincoln
found
the
militia
refractory
they
refused
to
submit
to
the
articles
of
war
and
desired
to
serve
only
under
those
laws
by
which
the
militia
was
governed
chagrined
with
this
resistance
lincoln
transferred
the
militia
to
moultrie
and
at
the
head
of
about
troops
of
the
regular
service
he
marched
up
the
country
to
augusta
proposing
by
this
course
to
circumscribe
the
progress
of
the
enemy
in
that
quarter
taking
advantage
of
this
movement
by
which
the
regular
troops
were
withdrawn
from
the
seaboard
the
british
general
prevost
immediately
crossed
the
savannah
with
the
intention
of
surprising
moultrie
who
with
lay
at
black
swamp
but
moultrie
advised
of
his
enemy
retired
to
coosawhatchie
where
he
placed
his
rear
guard
his
headquarters
being
pitched
on
the
hill
east
of
tuliffinnee
two
miles
in
advance
and
on
the
route
to
charleston
here
the
under
colonel
laurens
engaged
the
advance
and
was
driven
before
it
moultrie
gradually
retired
as
prevost
advanced
and
the
contest
which
followed
between
the
two
seemed
to
be
which
should
reach
charleston
first
the
defenceless
condition
of
that
city
was
known
to
the
british
general
whose
object
was
to
take
it
by
de
main
moultrie
erred
in
not
making
continued
fight
in
the
swamps
and
strong
passes
the
thick
forests
and
intricate
defiles
which
were
numerous
along
the
route
of
the
pursuing
army
his
policy
seems
to
have
been
dictated
by
an
undue
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
city
and
the
importance
of
its
safety
to
the
state
but
for
this
even
an
army
so
much
inferior
as
his
could
have
effectually
checked
the
enemy
long
before
the
city
could
have
been
reached
moultrie
continued
in
advance
of
prevost
and
reached
charleston
a
few
hours
before
him
just
in
season
to
establish
something
like
order
and
put
the
place
in
a
tolerable
state
of
defence
the
fire
from
the
lines
arrested
the
british
advance
the
place
was
summoned
and
defiance
returned
night
followed
and
the
next
morning
the
enemy
had
disappeared
his
object
had
been
surprise
he
was
unprepared
for
the
assault
having
no
heavy
artillery
and
his
departure
was
hastened
by
intercepted
advices
from
lincoln
and
governor
rutledge
which
announced
to
the
garrison
the
approach
of
the
regular
troops
and
the
country
militia
prevost
retired
to
the
neighboring
islands
and
established
himself
in
a
strong
fort
at
stono
ferry
here
he
was
attacked
by
general
lincoln
in
a
spirited
but
unsuccessful
affair
in
which
the
latter
was
compelled
to
retreat
the
attack
of
lincoln
was
followed
by
one
of
moultrie
in
galleys
the
situation
of
the
british
became
unpleasant
and
they
did
not
wait
a
repetition
of
these
assaults
but
retreated
along
the
chain
of
islands
on
the
coast
until
they
reached
beaufort
and
savannah
both
of
these
places
they
maintained
the
latter
with
their
main
army
the
former
with
a
strong
body
of
troops
apart
from
their
sick
wounded
and
convalescent
here
they
were
watched
by
general
lincoln
in
a
camp
of
observation
at
sheldon
until
the
appearance
of
a
french
fleet
on
the
coast
led
to
renewed
activity
and
hopes
on
the
part
of
the
americans
which
were
destined
to
bitter
disappointment
marion
was
certainly
with
his
regiment
at
sheldon
and
when
it
became
probable
that
there
was
some
prospect
of
battle
we
find
him
at
fort
moultrie
when
prevost
was
in
possession
of
the
contiguous
islands
but
a
junction
of
the
french
and
american
forces
necessarily
compelling
the
concentration
of
the
whole
of
the
southern
invading
army
at
savannah
lessened
the
necessity
of
his
remaining
at
a
post
which
stood
in
no
manner
of
danger
early
in
september
the
french
admiral
count
with
a
fleet
of
twenty
sail
appeared
upon
the
coast
as
soon
as
this
was
certainly
known
general
lincoln
put
his
army
in
motion
for
savannah
but
the
french
forces
had
disembarked
before
his
arrival
and
the
impatience
and
imprudence
of
their
admiral
did
not
suffer
him
to
wait
the
coming
of
the
american
he
was
a
rash
man
and
as
it
appears
on
bad
terms
with
his
subordinate
officers
who
were
indeed
not
subordinate
he
proceeded
to
summon
the
place
the
answer
to
his
demand
was
a
request
of
hours
for
consideration
by
a
singular
error
of
judgment
the
french
admiral
granted
the
time
required
his
only
hope
had
been
in
a
de
main
he
had
neither
the
time
nor
the
material
necessary
for
regular
approaches
nor
had
he
acted
decisively
do
these
seem
to
have
been
at
all
necessary
the
place
was
not
tenable
at
the
period
of
his
first
summons
the
prompt
energies
of
the
british
commander
soon
made
it
so
instead
of
considering
he
consumed
the
hours
in
working
the
arrival
of
cruger
with
a
small
command
from
sunbury
and
the
force
of
maitland
from
beaufort
soon
put
the
fortress
in
such
a
condition
of
defence
as
to
enable
its
commander
to
return
his
defiance
to
the
renewed
summons
of
the
combined
armies
there
seems
to
have
been
but
one
opinion
among
the
americans
as
to
the
mistake
of
in
granting
the
required
indulgence
weems
speaking
for
general
horry
says
i
never
beheld
marion
in
so
great
a
passion
i
was
actually
afraid
he
would
have
broken
out
on
general
lincoln
god
he
exclaimed
ever
heard
of
anything
like
this
before
first
allow
an
enemy
to
entrench
and
then
fight
him
see
the
destruction
brought
upon
the
british
at
bunker
hill
yet
our
troops
there
were
only
militia
raw
clodhoppers
and
not
a
mortar
or
carronade
not
even
a
swivel
only
their
what
then
are
we
to
expect
from
regulars
completely
armed
with
a
choice
train
of
artillery
and
covered
by
a
breastwork
pinckney
account
of
the
siege
of
savannah
quoted
by
the
anticipations
of
marion
were
fully
realized
when
the
junction
of
the
french
and
american
armies
was
effected
it
was
determined
to
reduce
the
place
by
siege
batteries
were
to
be
erected
and
cannon
brought
from
the
ships
a
distance
of
several
miles
meanwhile
the
works
of
the
besieged
were
undergoing
daily
improvements
under
an
able
engineer
several
hundred
negroes
were
busy
day
and
night
upon
the
defences
stimulated
when
necessary
to
exertion
by
the
lash
on
the
of
october
the
besiegers
opened
with
nine
mortars
and
pieces
of
cannon
from
the
land
side
and
sixteen
from
the
water
they
continued
to
play
for
several
days
with
little
effect
and
the
anxiety
of
the
french
admiral
to
leave
the
coast
at
a
season
of
the
year
when
it
is
particularly
perilous
to
shipping
to
remain
determined
the
besiegers
to
risk
everything
upon
an
assault
the
morning
of
the
october
was
fixed
upon
for
the
attack
the
american
army
was
paraded
at
one
that
morning
but
it
was
near
four
before
the
head
of
the
french
column
reached
the
front
the
whole
army
then
marched
towards
the
skirt
of
the
wood
in
one
long
column
and
as
they
approached
the
open
space
was
to
break
off
into
the
different
columns
as
ordered
for
the
attack
but
by
the
time
the
first
french
column
had
arrived
at
the
open
space
the
day
had
fairly
broke
when
count
without
waiting
until
the
other
columns
had
arrived
at
their
position
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
his
first
column
and
rushed
forward
to
the
attack
this
was
creditable
to
his
gallantry
if
not
to
his
judgment
but
it
was
valor
thrown
away
the
column
was
so
severely
galled
by
the
from
the
batteries
as
they
advanced
and
by
both
and
musketry
when
they
reached
the
abbatis
that
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
officers
it
got
into
confusion
and
broke
away
to
their
left
toward
the
wood
in
that
direction
the
second
and
third
french
columns
shared
successively
the
same
fate
having
the
additional
discouragement
of
seeing
as
they
marched
to
the
attack
the
repulse
and
loss
of
their
comrades
who
had
preceded
them
count
pulaski
who
with
the
cavalry
preceded
the
right
column
of
the
americans
proceeded
gallantly
until
stopped
by
the
abbatis
and
before
he
could
force
through
it
received
his
mortal
wound
the
american
column
was
much
more
successful
it
was
headed
by
colonel
laurens
with
the
light
infantry
followed
by
the
second
south
carolina
regiment
of
which
marion
was
second
in
command
and
the
first
battalion
of
charleston
militia
this
column
pressed
forward
in
the
face
of
a
heavy
fire
upon
the
spring
hill
redoubt
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
ditch
and
the
colors
of
the
second
regiment
were
planted
upon
the
berm
but
the
parapet
was
too
high
to
be
scaled
under
such
a
fire
as
proceeded
from
the
walls
and
struggling
bravely
but
vainly
the
assailants
were
after
suffering
severe
slaughter
driven
out
of
the
ditch
this
slaughter
was
increased
in
the
effort
to
retain
and
carry
off
in
safety
the
colors
of
the
regiment
thomas
pinckney
in
a
letter
quoted
by
garden
thomas
pinckney
see
these
colors
as
we
have
seen
were
the
gift
of
a
lady
moultrie
in
the
name
of
the
regiment
had
promised
to
defend
them
to
the
last
the
promise
was
faithfully
remembered
in
this
moment
of
extremity
one
of
them
was
borne
by
lieutenant
bush
supported
by
sergeant
jasper
the
other
by
lieutenant
grey
supported
by
sergeant
bush
being
slightly
wounded
early
in
the
action
delivered
his
standard
to
jasper
for
better
security
jasper
a
second
time
and
now
fatally
wounded
restored
it
to
the
former
but
at
the
moment
of
taking
it
bush
received
a
mortal
wound
he
fell
into
the
ditch
with
his
ensign
under
him
and
it
remained
in
possession
of
the
enemy
the
other
standard
was
more
fortunate
lieutenant
grey
by
whom
it
was
borne
was
slain
but
plucked
it
from
the
redoubt
where
it
had
been
planted
the
moment
the
retreat
was
ordered
and
succeeded
in
carrying
it
off
in
safety
the
repulse
was
decisive
the
slaughter
for
so
brief
an
engagement
had
been
terrible
amounting
to
nearly
eleven
hundred
men
french
and
americans
of
the
former
the
irish
brigade
and
of
the
latter
the
south
carolina
regiment
particularly
distinguished
themselves
and
suffered
most
the
loss
of
the
british
was
slight
the
assailants
made
no
impression
on
their
works
thus
was
this
fine
body
of
troops
sacrificed
by
the
imprudence
of
the
french
general
who
being
of
superior
grade
commanded
the
whole
in
this
battle
jasper
was
mortally
wounded
he
succeeded
in
regaining
the
camp
of
the
americans
the
fatal
wound
was
received
in
his
endeavor
to
secure
and
save
his
colors
another
distinguished
personage
who
fell
in
this
fatal
affair
was
count
pulaski
a
brave
and
skilful
captain
of
cavalry
better
known
in
history
for
his
attempt
upon
the

t
chapter
from
the
battle
of

to
the
defeat
of
gates
at
camden
the
failure
of
the
combined
forces
of
france
and
america
before
the
walls
of
savannah
left
the
cause
of
the
latter
in
the
south
in
much
worse
condition
than
before
the
event
served
to
depress
the
carolinians
and
in
the
same
degree
to
elevate
and
encourage
the
enemy
the
allies
withdrew
to
their
ships
and
shortly
after
from
the
coast
general
lincoln
with
the
american
army
retreated
to
the
heights
of
ebenezer
and
thence
to
sheldon
proceeding
from
this
place
to
charleston
he
left
marion
in
command
of
the
army
on
the
of
january
he
writes
to
the
latter
as
follows
the
state
of
affairs
is
such
as
to
make
it
necessary
that
we
order
our
force
to
a
point
as
much
and
as
soon
as
possible
no
troops
will
be
kept
in
the
field
except
two
hundred
light
infantry
and
the
horse
washington
you
will
therefore
please
to
select
from
the
three
regiments
with
you
two
hundred
of
your
best
men
and
those
who
are
best
clothed
and
organize
them
into
corps
with
proper
officers
all
the
remainder
with
the
baggage
of
the
whole
saving
such
as
is
absolutely
necessary
for

will
march
immediately
for
this
town
you
will
please
take

of
the
light
infantry
until
lieut
henderson
arrives
which
i
expect
will
be
in
a
few
days
after
that
i
wish
to
see
you
as
soon
as
possible
in
charleston
in
the
february
following
marion
was
dispatched
to
bacon
bridge
on
ashley
river
where
moultrie
had
established
a
camp
for
the
reception
of
the
militia
of
the
neighborhood
as
well
as
those
which
had
been
summoned
from
the
interior
it
was
to
marion
that
lincoln
chiefly
looked
for
the
proper
drilling
of
the
militia
in
his
hands
they
lost
the
rude
and
inefficient
character
the
inexpert
and
spiritless
manner
which
under
ordinary
commanders
always
distinguish

to
the

of
that
city
its
conquest
was
desirable
on
many
accounts
and
circumstances
had
already
shown
that
this
was
not
a
matter
of
serious
difficulty
the
invasion
of

the
year
before
which
had

nearly
proved
successful

little
resistance
which
had
been
offered
to
him
while
traversing
more
than
one
hundred
miles
of
country
contiguous
to
the
capital
and
the
rich
spoils
which
on
his
retreat
had
been
borne
off
by
his
army
betrayed
at
once
the
wealth
and
weakness
of
that
region
the
possession
of
savannah
where
british
government
had
been
regularly
and
the
entire
if
not
totally
undisturbed
control
of
georgia
necessarily
facilitated
the
invasion
of
the
sister
province
south
carolina
was
now
a
frontier
equally
exposed
to
the
british
in
georgia
and
the
tories
of
florida
and
north
carolina
the
means
of
defence
in
her
power
were
now
far
fewer
than
when
prevost
made
his
attempt
on
charleston
the
southern
army
was
in
fact
totally
broken
up
the
carolina
regiments
had
seen
hard
service
guarding
the
frontier
and
contending
with

they
were
thinned

mere
handful
the
virginia
and

had
melted

the

which
they
had
enlisted
had
expired
the
georgia
regiment
captured
by
the
british
in
detail
were
perishing
in
their
floating

the
weakness
of
the
patriots
necessarily
increased
the
audacity
with
the
strength
of
their
enemies
the
loyalists
encouraged
by
the
progress
of
prevost
and
the
notorious
inefficiency
of
the
whigs
were
now
gathering
in
formidable
bodies
in
various
quarters
operating
in
desultory
bands

crowding
to
swell
the
columns
of
the
british
army
all
things
concurred
to
encourage
the
attempt
of
the
enemy
on
charleston
its
possession
with
that
of
savannah
would
not
only
enable
them
to
complete
their
ascendency
in
the
two
provinces
to
which
these
cities
belonged
but
would
probably
give
them
north
carolina
also
virginia
then
becoming
the
frontier
it
would
be
easy
with
the
cooperation
of
an
army
ascending
the
chesapeake
to
traverse
the
entire
south
with
their
legions
detaching
it
wholly
from
the
federal
compact
such
was
the
british
hope
and
such
their
policy
there
was
yet
another
motive
for
the
siege
of
charleston
considered
without
reference
to
collateral
or
contingent
events
esteemed
erroneously
as
a
place
of
great
security
an
error
that
arose
in
all
probability
from
the
simple
fact
of
the
successful
defence
of
fort
moultrie
it
was
crowded
with
valuable
magazines
as
a
trading
city
particularly
while
the
commerce
of
the
north
remained
interrupted
it
had
become
a
place
of
great
business
it
was
a
stronghold
for
privateers
and
their
prizes
and
always
contained
stores
and
shipping
of
immense
value
the
temptations
to
its
conquest
were
sufficiently
numerous
ten
thousand
choice
troops
with
a
large
and
heavy
train
of
artillery
were
accordingly
dispatched
from
new
york
for
its
investment
which
was
begun
in
february
and
conducted
by
the
of
the
british
forces
sir
henry
clinton
in
person
he
conducted
his
approaches
with
a
caution
highly
complimentary
to
the
besieged
the
fortifications
were
only
field
works
and
might
have
been
overrun
in
less
than
five
days
by
an
audacious
enemy
the
regular
troops
within
the
city
were
not
above
two
thousand
men
the
citizen
militia
increased
the
number
to
nearly
four
thousand
for
such
an
extent
of
lines
as
encircled
the
place
the
adequate
force
should
not
have
been
less
than
that
of
the
enemy
the
fortifications
when
the
british
first
landed
their
were
in
a
dilapidated
and
unfinished
state
and
at
that
time
the
defenders
apart
from
the
citizens
scarcely
exceeded
eight
hundred
men
while
the
small
pox
making
its
appearance
within
the
walls
for
the
first
time
for
twenty
years
an
enemy
much
more
dreaded
than
the
british
effectually
discouraged
the
country
militia
from
coming
to
the
assistance
of
the
citizens
under
these
circumstances
the
conquest
would
have
been
easy
to
an
active
and
energetic
foe
but
sir
henry
does
not
seem
to
have
been
impatient
for
his
laurels
he
was
willing
that
they
should
mature
gradually
and
he
sat
down
to
a
regular
and
formal
investment
it
was
an
error
of
the
carolinians
under
such
circumstances
to
risk
the
fortunes
of
the
state
and
the
greater
part
of
its
regular
military
strength
in
a
besieged
town
a
still
greater
to
do
so
in
defiance
of
such
difficulties
as
attended
the
defence
the
policy
which
determined
the
resolution
was
a
concession
to
the
citizens
in
spite
of
all
military
opinion
the
city
might
have
been
yielded
to
the
enemy
and
the
state
preserved
or
which
was
the
same
thing
the
troops
the
loss
of
four
thousand
men
from
the
ranks
of
active
warfare
was
the
great
and
substantial
loss
the
true
source
in
fact
of
most
of
the
miseries
and
crimes
by
which
the
very
bowels
of
the
country
were
subsequently
torn
and
distracted
it
was
the
great
good
fortune
of
the
state
that
francis
marion
was
not
among
those
who
fell
into
captivity
in
the
fall
of
charleston
he
had
marched
into
the
city
from
dorchester
when
his
active
services
were
needed
for
its
defence
but
while
the
investment
was
in
progress
and
before
it
had
been
fully
completed
an
event
occurred
to
him
an
accident
which
was
no
doubt
very
much
deplored
at
the
time
by
which
his
services
lost
for
the
present
were
subsequently
secured
for
the
country
dining
with
a
party
of
friends

house

mistaken
hospitality
which

virtue
to
a
vice
turned
the
key
upon
his
guests
to
prevent
escape
till
each
individual
should
be
gorged
with
wine
though
an
amiable
man
marion
was
a
strictly
temperate
one
he
was
not
disposed
to
submit
to
this
too
common
form
of
social
tyranny
yet
not
willing
to
resent
the
breach
of
propriety
by
converting
the
assembly
into
a
he
adopted
a
middle
course
which
displayed
equally
the
gentleness
and
firmness
of
his
temper
opening
a
window
he
coolly
threw
himself
into
the
street
he
was
unfortunate
in
the
attempt
the
apartment
was
on
the
second
story
the
height
considerable
and
the
adventure
cost
him
a
broken
ankle
the
injury
was
a
severe
and
shocking
one
and
for
the
time
totally
unfitted
him
for
service
he
left
the
city
in
a
litter
while
the
passage
to
the
country
still
remained
open
for
retreat
in
obedience
to
an
order
of
general
lincoln
for
the
departure
of
all
idle
mouths
all
supernumerary
officers
and
all
officers
unfit
for
duty
marion
retired
to
his
residence
in
john
parish
here
suffering
in
mind
and
body
he
awaited
with
impatience
the
progress
of
events
with
which
however
much
he
might
sympathize
he
could
not
share
his
humiliation
at
this
unavoidable
but
melancholy
inaction
may
be
imagined
from
what
we
know
of
his
habits
and
his
patriotism
the
siege
of
charleston
in
consequence
of
the
firm
bearing
of
the
besieged
and
the
cautious
policy
of
the
british
government
was
protracted
long
after
the
works
had
been
pronounced
untenable
it
was
yielded
unwillingly
to
the
conqueror
only
after
all
resistance
had
proved
in
vain
it
fell
by
famine
rather
than
by
the
arms
of
the
enemy
the
defence
was
highly
honorable
to
the
besieged
it
lasted
six
weeks
in
which
they
had
displayed
equal
courage
and
endurance
the
consequences
of
this
misfortune
leave
it
somewhat
doubtful
whether
the
determination
to
defend
the
city
to
the
last
extremity
was
not
the
result
of
a
correct
policy
considering
less
its
own
loss
and
that
of
the
army
than
the
effect
of
the
former
upon
the
rustic
population
certainly
the
capture
of
the
army
was
a
vital
misfortune
to
the
southern
states
yet
the
loss
of
the
city
itself
was
of
prodigious
effect
upon
the
scattered
settlements
of
the
country
the
character
and
resolve
of
the
capital
cities
in
those
days
were
very
much
the
sources
of
the
moral
strength
of
the
interior
sparsely
settled
with
unfrequent
opportunities
of
communion
with
one
another
the
minds
of
the
forest
population
turned
naturally
for
their
tone
and
direction
to
the
capital
city
the
active
attrition
of
rival
and
conflicting
minds
gives
in
all
countries
to
the
population
of
a
dense
community
an
intellectual
superiority
over
those
who
live
remote
and
feel
none
of
the
constant
moral
strifes
to
which
the
citizen
is
subject
in
south
carolina
charleston
had
been
the
seat
of
the
original

incurred
the
first
dangers
achieved
the
first
victories
and
in
all
public
proceedings
where
action
was
desirable
had
always
led
off
in
the
van
to
preserve
intact
and
from
overthrow
the
seat
of
ancient
authority
and
opinion
was
surely
a
policy
neither
selfish
nor
unwise
perhaps
after
all
the
grand
error
was
in
not
making
the
preparations
for
defence
adequate
to
the
object
the
resources
of
the
state
were
small
and
these
had
been
diminished
wofully
in
succoring
her
neighbors
and
in
small
border
strifes
which
the
borderers
might
have
been
taught
to
manage
for
themselves
the
military
force
of
the
state
under
any
circumstances
could
not
have
contended
on
equal
terms
with
the
ten
thousand
regulars
of
sir
henry
clinton
the
assistance
derived
from
virginia
and
north
carolina
was
little
more
than
nominal
calculated
rather
to
swell
the
triumph
of
the
victor
than
to
retard
his
successes
if
the
movements
of
the
british
were
slow
and
deficient
in
military
enterprise
where
sir
henry
clinton
commanded
in
person
such
could
not
be
said
of
them
after
the
conquest
of
charleston
was
effected
the
was
succeeded
by
earl
cornwallis
and
his
career
was
certainly
obnoxious
to
no
such
reproaches
we
shall
have
more
serious
charges
to
bring
against
him
of
the
gross
abuse
of
power
wanton
tyrannies
cruel
murders
and
most
reckless
disregard
of
decency
and
right
by
which
the
course
of
the
british
was
subsequently
distinguished
we
shall
say
no
more
than
will
suffice
to
show
in
what
dangers
through
what
difficulties
and
under
what
stimulating
causes
francis
marion
rose
in
arms
when
everything
appeared
to
be
lost

in
possession
of
the
enemy

proceeded
with
wonderful
activity
to
use
all
means
in
their
power
for
exhausting
the
resources
and
breaking
down
the
spirit
of
the
country
their
maxim
was
that
of
habitual
tyranny
might
is
right
they
seemed
to
recognize
no
other
standard
the
articles
of
capitulation
the
laws
of
nations
private

the
dictates
of
humanity
and
religion
were
all
equally
set
at
naught
the
wealth
of
private
families
slaves
by
thousands
were
hurried
into
the
waists
of
british
ships
as
the
legitimate
spoils
of
war
the
latter
found
a
market
in
the
west
india
islands
the
prisoners
made
by
the
fall
of
charleston
were
in
defiance
of
the
articles
of
capitulation
crowded
into
from
whence
they
were
only
released
by
death
or
by
yielding
to
those
arguments
of
their
keepers
which
persuaded
them
to
enlist
in
british
regiments
to
serve
in
other
countries
many
yielded
to
these
arguments
with
the
simple
hope
of
escape
from
the
horrors
by
which
they
were
surrounded
when
arts
and
arguments
failed
to
overcome
the
inflexibility
of
these
wretched
prisoners
compulsion
was
resorted
to
and
hundreds
were
forced
from
their
country
shipped
to
jamaica
and
there
made
to

citizens
of
distinction
who
by
their
counsel
or
presence
opposed
their
influence
over

or
proved
themselves
superior

temptations

torn
from
their
homes
without
warning
and
incarcerated
in
their
floating
dungeons
nothing
was
forborne
in
the
shape
of
pitiless
and

the
fall
of

seems
necessarily
to
have
involved
the
safety
of
the
country
from
the
savannah
to
the
pedee
in
a
few
weeks
after
the
capture
of
the
city
the
british
were
in
peaceable
possession
of
the
space
between
these
limits
from
the
seaboard
to
the
mountains
they
had
few
opponents
an
isolated
body
of
continentals
a
small
squad
of
militia
for
the
first
time
drilling
for
future
service
or
a
little
troop
of
horse
and
these
were
quickly
overcome
on
these
occasions
the
british
were
generally
led
by

this
officer
acquired
for
himself
an
odious
distinction
in
his
progress
through
the
south
in
the
campaigns
which
followed
he
was
rather
an
active
than
a
skilful
commander
rapid
in
his
movements
he
gave
little
heed
to
the
judicious
disposition
of
his
troops
and
aiming
more
at
impressing
the
fears
of
his
enemy
than
overcoming
him
by
science
his
chief
successes
were
the
result
of
the
panic
which
his
surprises
and
his
butcheries
inspired
he
seems
never
to
have
been
successful
against
an
equal
and
resolute
foe
but
as
courage
and
activity
are
perhaps
after
all
and
before
all
the
most
necessary
requisites
for
a
soldier
services
were
inappreciable
to
the
invading
army
in
one
month
after
its
arrival
his
legion
was
mounted
and
began
its
career
of
slaughter
while
yet
the
city
was
sustaining
the
siege
he
penetrated
the
country
in
pursuit
of
those
bands
of
militia
horse
which
by
direction
of
the
american
commander
still
kept
the
open
field
on
the
of
march
he
surprised
a
company
of
militia
at
salkehatchie
bridge
killed
and
wounded
several
and
dispersed
the
rest
five
days
after
another
party
at
shared
the
same
fortune
he
was
not
so
successful
at
rantowles
on
the
of
the
same
month
where
in
a
rencounter
with
washington
his
dragoons
were
roughly
handled
and
retreated
with
loss
he
avenged
himself
however
on
washington
in
less
than
a
month
after
by
surprising
him
at
monk
corner
white
soon
after
took
command
of
the
southern
cavalry
and
obtained
some
trifling
successes
but
suffered
himself
to
be
surprised
at
lenud
ferry
on
the
santee
these
events
all
took
place
prior
to

surrender
of

activity
of

the
general
remissness
and
want
of
ordinary
military
precautions
on
the
part
of
the
militia
which
opposed
itself
to
him
made
his
progress
easy
and
thus
enabled
him
to
cut
off
every
party
that
was
embodied
in
the
field
he
was
now
to
succeed
in
a
much
more
important
and
much
more
bloody
enterprise
a
continental
force
from
virginia
of
four
hundred
men
under
beaufort
had
been
dispatched
to
the
relief
of
charleston
beaufort
had
reached
camden
before
he
was
apprised
of

surrender
of

properly
determined
him
to
retreat
earl

with

force
of
hundred

and
was
then
in
rapid
progress
for

of

dispatched
tarleton
in

of
him
with
a
select
body
of
infantry

in
all
seven
hundred

beaufort
was
overtaken
near
the
waxhaw
settlements
and
summoned
to
surrender
this
person
does
not
seem
to
have
been
designed
by
nature
for
military
operations
he
halted
at
the
summons
hesitated
awhile
sent
his
wagons
ahead
consulted
with
his
officers
and
did
little
or
nothing
farther
either
for
flight
or

marion
meanwhile
incapable
of
present
flight
was
compelled
to
take
refuge
in
the
swamp
and
forest
he
was
too
conspicuous
a
person
had
made
too
great
a
figure
in
previous
campaigns
and
his
military
talents
were
too
well
known
and
too
highly
esteemed
not
to
render
him
an
object
of
some
anxiety
as
well
to
friends
as
foes
still
suffering
from
the
hurts
received
in
charleston
with
bloody
and
malignant
enemies
all
around
him
his
safety
depended
on
his
secrecy
and
obscurity
alone
fortunately
he
had
won
golden
opinions
from
all
sorts
of
people
he
had
friends
among
all
classes
who
did
not
permit
themselves
to
sleep
while
he
was
in
danger
their
activity
supplied
the
loss
of
his
own
they
watched
while
he
slept
they
assisted

feebleness
in
the
moment
of
alarm
he
was
sped
from
house
to
house
from

to
thicket
from
the
thicket
to
the
swamp
his
under
these
frequent
exigencies
were
no
doubt
among
the
most
interesting
adventures
of
his
life
furnishing
rare
material
could
they
be
procured
for
the
poet
and
romancer
unhappily
while
the
chronicles
show
the
frequent
emergency
which
attended
his
painful
condition
they
furnish
nothing
more
we
are
without
details
the
melancholy
baldness
and
coldness
with
which
they
narrate
events
upon
which
one
would
like
to
linger
is
absolutely
humbling
to
the
imagination
which
kindled
by
the
simple
historical
outline
looks
in
vain
for
the
satisfaction
of
those
doubts
and
inquiries
those
hopes
and
fears
which
the
provoking
narrative
inspires
only
to
defraud

would
some
old
inquisitive
froissart
have
dragged
by
frequent
inquiry
from
contemporaneous
lips
the
particular

the
whole

step

item
by
item
the
close
pursuit
the
narrow

all
the
long
train
of
little

efficient
circumstances
by
which
the
story
would
have
been
made
unique
with
all
its
rich
and
numerous
details
these
the

must

from
his

he
must
conjecture

himself

or

by
which
the
fugitive
is
counselled
to
hurry
to
his
den
a
thousand
events
arise
to
the
imagination
as
likely
to
have
occurred
to
our
partisan
in
his
hours
of
feebleness
and
danger
from
the
rapid
cavalry
of
tarleton
or
the
close
and
keen
pursuit
of
the
revengeful
tories
to
what
slight
circumstances
has
he
been
indebted
for
his
frequent
escape
what
humble
agents
have
been
commissioned
by
providence
to
save
a
life
that
was
destined
to
be
so
precious
to
his
country
liberties
how
long
he
remained
in
this
situation
is
not
exactly
known
probably
several
months
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
mount
his
horse
he
collected
a
few
friends
and
set
out
for
north
carolina
a
continental
force
was
on
its
way
from
virginia
under
baron
de
kalb
his
purpose
was
to
join
it
it
was
while
on
this
route
and
with
this
object
that
he
encountered
his
old
friend
and
long
tried
associate
in
arms
p
horry
there
were
two
horrys
brothers
both
of
whom
were
very
brave
and
distinguished
adherents
of
our
partisan

a
captain

in
the

regiment
with
marion

the
battle
of

horry

the
particular
favorite
of
his
general

to
be
in
part
by
the
former
but
really
composed
entirely
by
the
rev

from
facts
furnished
by
horry
is
already
well
known
to
the
public
a
life
of
peter
horry
is
now
before
me
and
has
furnished
me
with
several
illustrations
of
the
war
during
this
narrative
both
of
these
brothers
served
under
marion
to
the
close
of
the
war
with
equal
courage
and
horry
describes
his
ankle
at
this
meeting
as
still
very
crazy
so
much
so
that
it
required
his
help
and
that
of
marion
servant
to
lift
him
from
his
horse
but
his
spirits
were
good
he
was
still
cheerful
and
possessed
that
rare
elasticity
of
character
which
never
loses
its
tone
under
privations
and
disappointments
weems
who
we
are
compelled
to
admit
very
frequently
exercised
the
privilege
of
the
ancient
historian
of
putting
fine
speeches
into
the
mouth
of
his
hero
tells
us
that
he
jeered
at
the
doleful
expressions
of
his
companion
horry
who
discussing
the
condition
of
the
country
lamented
that
their
happy
days
were
all
gone
our
happy
days
all
gone
indeed
answered
marion
on
the
contrary
they
are
yet
to
come
the
victory
is
still
sure
the
enemy
it
is
true
have
all
the
trumps
and
if
they
had
but
the
spirit
to
play
a
generous
game
they
would
certainly
ruin
us
but
they
have
no
idea
of
that
game
they
will
treat
the
people
cruelly
and
that
one
thing
will
ruin
them
and
save
the
country
weems
speaking
for
horry
describes
in
ludicrous
terms
their
journey
through
north
carolina
through
a
region
swarming
with
tories
but
fortunately
for
our
travellers
who
were
venomous
without
being
active
our
fugitives
were
without
money
and
without
credit
and
but
for
carrying
a
knife
or
a
horse
fleam
or
a

no
more
use
for
a
pocket
than
a
highlander
has
for
a

to
hard
money
we
had
not
seen
a
dollar
for
years
in
this
resourceless
condition
a
condition
which
it
may
be
well
to
say
in
this
place
continued
throughout
the
war
they
made
their
way
with
difficulty
until
they
joined
the
continental
army
gates
had
superseded
de
kalb
in
its
command
and
was
pressing
forward
with
the
ambition
seemingly
of
writing
a
dispatch
like
caesar
announcing
in
the
same
breath
the
sight
and
conquest
of
his
enemy
marion
and
his
little
troop
of
twenty
men
made
but
a
sorry
figure
in
the
presence
of
the
continental
general
gates
was
a
man
of
moderate
abilities
a
vain
man
of
a
swelling
and
ostentatious
habit
whose
judgment
was
very
apt
to
be
affected
by
parade
and
the
external
show
of
things
some
of
his
leading
opinions
were
calculated
to
show
that
he
was
unfit
for
a
commander
in
the
south
for
example
he
thought
little
of
cavalry
which
in
a
plain
country
sparsely
settled
was
among
the
first
essentials
of
success
as
well
in
securing
intelligence
as
in
procuring
supplies
it
was
not
calculated
therefore
to
raise
the
troop
of
our
partisan
in
his
esteem
to
discover
that
they
were
all
good
riders
and
well
mounted
marion
himself
was
a
man
equally
modest
in
approach
and
unimposing
in
person
his
followers
may
have
provoked
the
sneer
of
the
general
as
it
certainly
moved
the
scorn
and
laughter
of
his
continentals
we
have
a
description
of
them
from
the
pen
of
an
excellent
officer
the
adjutant
general
of
gates
army
he
says
marion
a
gentleman
of
south
carolina
had
been
with
the
army
a
few
days
attended
by
a
very
few
followers
distinguished
by
small
leather
caps
and
the
wretchedness
of
their
attire
their
number
did
not
exceed
twenty
men
and
boys
some
white
some
black
and
all
mounted
but
most
of
them
miserably
equipped
their
appearance
was
in
fact
so
burlesque
that
it
was
with
much
difficulty
the
diversion
of
the
regular
soldiery
was
restrained
by
the
officers
and
the
general
himself
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
detaching
marion
at
his
own
instance
towards
the
interior
of
south
carolina
with
orders
to
watch
the
motions
of
the
enemy
and
furnish
intelligence
narrative
of
the
campaign
of
by
otho
from
such
small
and
insignificant
beginnings
flow
greatness
and
great
performances
we
who
are
in
possession
of
all
the
subsequent
events
who
see
this
proud
vain
commander
hurrying
on
with
the
rapidity
of
madness
to
his
own
ruin
can
but
smile
in
the
perusal
of
such
a
narrative
not
at
the
rags
of
marion
men
but
at
the
undiscerning
character
of
those
who
could
see
in
the
mean
equipment
the
imperfect
clothing
the
mixture
of
man
and
boy
and
white
and
black
anything
but
a
noble
patriotism
which
in
such
condition
was
still
content
to
carry
on
a
war
against
a
powerful
enemy
the
very
rags
and
poverty
of
this
little
band
which
was
afterwards
to
become
so
famous
were
so
many
proofs
of
their
integrity
and
virtue
and
should
have
inspired
respect
rather
than
ridicule
they
were
so
many
guarantees
of
good
service
which
they
were
able
and
prepared
to
render
it
was
in
defiance
of
the
temptations
and
the
power
of
the
foe
that
these
men
had
taken
the
field
against
him
and
had
gates
been
a
wise
commander
he
would
have
seen
even
through
their
rags
and
destitution
the
small
but
steady
light
of
patriotism
which
enkindled
throughout
the
state
by
the
example
of
marion
sumter
and
a
few
others
was
to
blaze
out
finally
into
that
perfect
brightness
before
which
the
invader
was
to
shrink
confounded
gates
was
wise
enough
to
take
counsel
of
marion
if
nothing
more
and
even
this
might
not
have
been
done
but
for
the
suggestions
of
governor
rutledge
who
at
that
time
in
the
camp
of
the
continentals
might
very
well
have
informed
him
of
the
value
of
the
man
whose
followers
inspired
only
ridicule
it
was
with
marion
that
the
plan
was
concerted
and
not
improbably
at
his
suggestion
for
moving
into
the
very
heart
of
the
state
this
subsequently
was
the
policy
of
greene
and
had
gates
adopted
the
deliberate
caution
of
that
commander
his
successes
would
unquestionably
have
been
the
same
the
object
of
such
a
movement
was
to
give
an
opportunity
to
the
native
patriots
to
rally
to
compel
the
british
to
concentrate
their
scattered
forces
call
in
their
detached
parties
and
thus
circumscribe
their
influence
within
the
state
to
the
places
where
they
still
remained
in
force
to
effect
these
objects
the
fabian
maxims
of
warfare
should
have
been
those
of
the
american
general
few
of
his
militia
had
ever
seen
an
enemy
he
had
but
recently
joined
his
troops
knew
nothing
of
them
and
they
as
little
of
him
their
march
had
been
a
fatiguing
one
time
and
training
were
necessary
for
their
improvement
and
his
success
unhappily
these
were
the
very
agents
with
which
the
vanity
of
the
unfortunate
commander
made
him
most
willing
to
dispense
the
victory
at
saratoga
had
spoiled
him
for
ever
and
thinking
too
much
of
himself
he
committed
the
next
great
error
of
a
military
man
of
thinking
too
lightly
of
his
foe
it
would
be
idle
and
perhaps
impertinent
to
suggest
that
if
marion
had
been
suffered
to
remain
with
him
the
issue
of
this
march
might
have
been
more
fortunate
gates
was
quite
too
to
listen
and
marion
quite
too
moderate
to
obtrude
his
opinions
and
yet
marion
was
a
man
of
equal
prudence
and
adroitness
he
could
insinuate
advice
so
that
it
would
appear
to
the
very
creature
of
its
own
conceptions
had
marion
remained
could
gates
have
listened
we
are
very
sure
there
would
have
been
no
such
final
fatal
disaster
as
suddenly
stopped
the
misdirected
progress
of
the
continental
army
there
would
have
been
some
redeeming
circumstances
to
qualify
the
catastrophe
all
would
not
have
been
lost
at
all
events
with
marion
at
their
head
the
militia
would
have
fought
awhile
would
have
discharged
their
pieces
once
twice
thrice
before
they
fled
they
would
have
done
for
the
of
militia
what
they
refused
to
do
for
a
commander
who
neither
knew
how
to
esteem
nor
how
to
conduct
them
it
was
while
marion
was
in
the
camp
of
gates
that
a
messenger
from
the
whigs
of
williamsburg
then
newly
risen
in
arms
summoned
him
to
be
their
leader
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
invitation
and
not
because
of
the
awkwardness
of
his
position
there
that
he
determined
to
penetrate
into
south
carolina
in
advance
of
the
american
army
such
an
invitation
was
not
to
be
neglected
marion
well
knew
its
importance
and
at
once
accepted
the
commission
conferred
upon
him
by
governor
rutledge
he
took
leave
of
gates
accordingly
having
received
as
is
reported
certain
instructions
from
that
unhappy
commander
to
employ
his
men
in
the
destruction
of
all
the
scows
boats
and
barges
on
the
route
by
which
the
enemy
might
make
his
escape
the
fancy
of
the
american
general
already
beheld
the
army
of
lord
cornwallis
in
full
flight
his
great
solicitude
seems
to
have
been
how
to
secure
his
captives
he
had
strangely
enough
for
a
military
man
never
taken
counsel
of
the
proverb
which
we
need
not
here
repeat
for
the
benefit
of
the
reader
with
the
departure
of
marion
his
better
genius
left
him
the
only
man
who
in
command
of
the
militia
might
have
saved
him
from
destruction
leaving
our
partisan
with
his
little
squad
to
make
his
way
cautiously
through
a
country
infested
with
tories
we
follow
for
the
present
the
progress
of
the
continental
army
on
the
night
of
the
fifteenth
of
august
the
americans
moved
from
rugely
mills
at
midnight
without
dreaming
of
an
enemy
they
encountered
him
the
first
intelligence
communicated
to
either
army
of
the
presence
of
the
other
was
from
the
fire
of
the
british
advance
upon
the
americans
the
two
armies
recoiled
and
lay
upon
their
arms
the
rest
of
the
night
so
far
the
affair
was
indecisive
the
americans
had
sustained
themselves
in
the
face
of
some
disadvantages
chiefly
the
result
of
their
leader
imprudence
a
night
march
of
raw
militia
in
the
face
of
a
foe
and
in
column
of
battle
was
itself
an
error
which
a
sagacious
commander
would
never
have
made
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
the
americans
were
not
satisfied
with
their
situation
some
of
their
officers
openly
declared
their
discontent
but
it
was
too
late
for
a
retrograde
movement
nor
is
it
likely
feeling
as
he
did
and
sanguine
as
he
was
that
gates
would
have
believed
any
such
movement
necessary
the
ground
was
equally
unknown
to
both
commanders
but
cornwallis
had
one
advantage
he
was
in
the
command
of
veterans
who
are
generally
cool
enough
in
such
situations
to
look
about
them
and
make
the
most
of
their
exigencies
the
american
line
was
soon
formed
and
in
waiting
for
the
dawn
and
the
enemy
the
first
maryland
division
including
the
delawares
under
de
kalb
was
posted
on
the
right
the
virginia
militia
under
stevens
on
the
left
the
north
carolinians
led
by
caswell
in
the
centre
and
the
artillery
in
battery
upon
the
road
both
wings
rested
on
morasses
and
the
second
maryland
brigade
was
posted
as
a
reserve
a
few
hundred
yards
in
the
rear
of
the
first
the
british
formed
a
single
line
with
each
wing
covered
and
supported
by
a
body
in
reserve
they
were
much
less
numerous
than
the
americans
but
they
were
picked
men
the
choice
of
the
regiments
in
charleston
and
camden
the
american
militia
of
which
the
greater
part
of
gates
army
consisted
had
never
felt
an
enemy
fire
the
maryland
and
delaware
troops
were
good
soldiers
well
trained
and
in
confidence
of
their
leaders
with
the
break
of
day
and
the
advance
of
the
american
left
the
action
began
this
division
of
the
army
consisted
of
virginia
militia
under
stevens
handled
with
unexpected
severity
by
the
british
fire
they
yielded
before
it
and
fled
in
panic
many
of
them
without
even
discharging
their
pieces
the
wretched
example
was
followed
by
the
north
carolina
militia
with
the
exception
of
a
single
corps
commanded
by
major
dixon
the
cavalry
under
armand
a
foreign
adventurer
broke
at
nearly
the
same
moment
and
a
charge
of
the
british
cavalry
happily
timed
put
an
end
to
all
hope
of
rallying
the
fugitives
the
devoted
continentals
alone
kept
their
ground
and
bore
the
brunt
of
the
action
they
were
led
by
the
veteran
de
kalb
the
having
hurried
from
the
field
in
a
vain
attempt
to
bring
the
militia
back
the
artillery
was
lost
the
cavalry
dispersed
the
regulars
numbering
but
nine
hundred
men
were
required
to
bear
the
undivided
pressure
of
two
thousand
of
the
best
troops
in
the
british
service
with
the
example
before
them
the
desertion
of
their
general
and
their
own
perfect
isolation
they
would
have
been
justified
by
the
necessity
of
the
case
in
instant
flight
but
as
if
the
cowardice
of
their
countrymen
had
stung
them
into
a
determination
to
show
at
all
hazards
that
they
at
least
were
made
of
very
different
stuff
they
not
only
resisted
the
attack
of
the
enemy
but
carried
the
bayonet
into
his
ranks
the
combatants
rushed
and
reeled
together
with
locked
weapons
but
this
struggle
could
not
last
the
conflict
was
prolonged
only
until
the
british
cavalry
could
return
from
pursuing
the
fugitives
their
sabres
gave
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
affair
de
kalb
had
fallen
under
eleven
wounds
and
nothing
remained
but
flight
to
save
this
gallant
body
from
the
mortification
of
surrender
on
the
field
of
battle
it
was
no
consolation
to
gates
while
fleeing
to
north
carolina
to
be
overtaken
by
messengers
from
sumter
announcing
a
gallant
achievement
of
that
brave
partisan
by
which
forty
wagons
of
booty
and
nearly
three
hundred
prisoners
had
fallen
into
his
hands
such
tidings
only
mocked
his
own
disaster
he
could
only
in
reply
relate
his
own
irretrievable
defeat
point
to
his
fugitives
and
counsel
sumter
to
immediate
retreat
from
his
triumphant
and
now
returning
enemy
unhappily
ignorant
of
disaster
and
of
a
bold
incautious
temper
sumter
was
approaching
rather
than
hastening
from
danger
his
flight
when
he
did
retire
was
not
sufficiently
rapid
nor
sufficiently
prudent
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
too
quickly
feel
themselves
secure
he
was
surprised
by
tarleton
but
two
days
after
his
troops
utterly
dispersed
he
too
a
fugitive
like
gates
with
all
the
fruits
of
his
late
victory
taken
from
his
grasp
in
almost
every
instance
where
the
americans
suffered
defeat
the
misfortune
was
due
to
a
want
of
proper
caution
an
unobservance
of
some
of
the
simplest
rules
of
military
prudence
in
a
brilliant
sortie
a
manful
charge
a
sudden
onslaught
no
troops
could
have
surpassed
them
nay
we
find
as
many
examples
of
the
sternest
powers
of
human
endurance
under
the
severest
trials
of
firmness
in
their
military
history
as
in
that
of
any
other
people
but
to
secure
what
they
had
won
to
be
consistently
firm
always
on
their
guard
and
beyond
surprise
were
lessons
which
they
were
slow
to
acquire
which
they
learned
at
last
only
under
the
heaviest
penalties
of
blood
marion
was
one
of
the
few
captains
of
american
militia
that
never
suffered
himself
to
be
taken
napping
as
are
becoming
rare
it
may
benefit
future
readers
to
know
that
this
proverb
is
almost
certainly

guard
with
prisoners
at
nelson
ferry
the
people
of
williamsburg
by
whom
marion
was
summoned
from
the
camp
of
gates
were
sprung
generally
from
irish
parentage
they
inherited
in
common
with
all
the
descendants
of
the
irish
in
america
a
hearty
detestation
of
the
english
name
and
authority
this
feeling
rendered
them
excellent
patriots
and
daring
soldiers
wherever
the
british
lion
was
the
object
of
hostility
those
of
whom
we
are
now
to
speak
the
people
of
williamsburg
were
men
generally
of
fearless
courage
powerful
frame
nerves
and
an
audacious
gallantry
that
led
them
to
delight
in
dangers
even
where
the
immediate
objects
by
no
means
justified
the
risk
they
felt
that
rapture
of
the
strife
in
which
the
goth
exulted
in
addition
to
these
natural
endowments
for
a
brave
soldiery
they
were
good
riders
and
famous
marksmen
hunters
that
knew
the
woods
almost
as
well
by
night
as
by
day
could
wind
about
and
through
the
camp
of
an
enemy
as
free
from
suspicion
as
the
squirrel
who
from
the
lateral
branches
of
the
pine
looks
over
their
encampment
they
possessed
resources
of
knowledge
and
ingenuity
while
in
swamp
and
thicket
not
merely
to
avoid
the
danger
but
in
not
unfrequent
instances
to
convert
it
to
their
own
advantage
nothing
but
the
training
and
direction
of
such
a
mind
as
was
needed
to
make
of
these
men
the
most
efficient
of
all
partisan
soldiery
the
formation
of
the
brigade
of
which
he
now
prepared
to
take
command
has
a
history
of
its
own
which
is
worth
telling
the
fame
which
it
subsequently
acquired
in
connection
with
its
leader
name
and
which
the
local
traditions
will
not
willingly
let
die
will
justify
us
in
the
narration
some
few
preliminary
facts
are
necessary
the
fall
of
charleston
and
the
dispersion
or
butchery
of
those
parties
which
had
kept
the
field
after
that
event
necessarily
depressed
the
spirits
and
discouraged
the
attempt
of
the
scattered
patriots
who
still
yearned
to
oppose
the
invaders
the
captivity
of
many
of
the
leaders
to
whom
they
were
accustomed
to
look
for
counsel
and
direction
and
the
flight
of
others
served
still
further
to
dissipate
any
hopes
or
purposes
which
they
might
have
had
of
concentration
thousands
fled
to
the
north
and
embodied
themselves
under
washington
and
other
american
generals
despairing
of
the
cause
at
home
everything
appeared
to
be
lost
and
a
timely
proclamation
of
sir
henry
clinton
a
few
days
after
the
surrender
of
charleston
tended
yet
more
to
subdue
the
spirit
of
resistance
the
proclamation
proffered
pardon
to
the
inhabitants
with
some
few
exceptions
for
their
past
treasonable
offences
and
a
reinstatement
in
their
rights
and
immunities
heretofore
enjoyed
exempt
from
taxation
except
by
their
own
legislature
this
specious
offer
made
at
a
moment
when
his
power
was
at
its
height
everywhere
unquestioned
and
unopposed
indicated
a
degree
of
magnanimity
which
in
the
case
of
those
thousands
in
every
such
contest
who
love
repose
better
than
virtue
was
everywhere
calculated
to
disarm
the
inhabitants
to
many
indeed
it
seemed
to
promise
all
for
which
they
had
been
contending
it
offered
security
from
further
injury
protection
against
the
tories
who
were
using
the
authority
of
the
british
for
their
own
purposes
of
plunder
and
revenge
a
respite
from
their
calamities
and
a
restoration
of
all
their
rights
with
the
immunities
thus
proffered
with
the
further
conviction
that
further
struggle
against
british
power
was
hopeless
with
the
assurance
indeed
which
was
industriously
conveyed
to
them
from
all
quarters
that
congress
not
able
to
assist
had
resolved
upon
yielding
the
provinces
of
south
carolina
and
georgia
to
the
enemy
as
considerations
for
the
independence
of
the
other
colonies
they
accepted
the
terms
thus
offered
them
by
the
british
commander
and
in
great
numbers
signed
declarations
of
allegiance
received
protection
as
subjects
of
the
crown
or
as
prisoners
of
war
were
paroled
to
their
plantations
could
the
british
have
persevered
in
this
policy
had
they
kept
faith
with
the
inhabitants
they
might
much
longer
have
held
possession
of
the
country
but
either
they
were
not
sincere
in
their
first
professions
or
their
subsequent
necessities
compelled
them
to
adopt
a
less
rational
policy
twenty
days
had
not
elapsed
from
the
publication
of
the
first
proclamation
when
it
was
followed
by
another
which
so
entirely
qualified
and
impaired
the
character
of
the
former
as
to
revolt
the
people
whom
it
had
invited
and
to
impress
them
with
the
conviction
that
they
had
been
imposed
upon
that
the
first
measure
was
a
mere
decoy
a
trap
involving
their
pledges
yet
withholding
the
very
securities
for
which
they
had
been
given
this
second
proclamation
premising
that
it
was
necessary
for
all
good
citizens
to
uphold
his
majesty
government
proceeded
to
discharge
from
protection
and
parole
all
persons
to
whom
such
papers
had
been
accorded
all
persons
not
absolutely
prisoners
of
war
taken
in
arms
were
to
be
reinstated
in
their
former
positions
as
citizens
but
as
citizens
of
the
british
empire
in
this
relation
the
farther
inferences
were
inevitable
they
were
now
actually
to
support
his
government
the
proclamation
ended
with
the
usual
penalties
all
who
neglected
to
return
to
their
allegiance
were
to
be
treated
as
rebels
the
policy
thus
adopted
by
the
british
commander
soon
made
them
so
the
object
of
the
carolinians
in
taking
protections
and
paroles
was
to
avoid
further
warfare
the
second
proclamation
of
the
british
general
required
them
to
take
up
arms
for
his
majesty
and
against
their
countrymen
this
was
a
hopeful
plan
by
which
to
fill
the
british
regiments
to
save
farther
importations
of
hessians
farther
cost
of
mercenaries
and
as
in
the
case
of
the
aborigines
to
employ
the
race
against
one
another
the
loyalists
of
the
south
were
to
be
used
against
the
patriots
of
the
north
as
the
loyalists
of
the
latter
region
had
been
employed
to
put
down
the
liberties
of
the
former
it
was
a
short
and
ingenious
process
for
finishing
the
rebellion
and
could
it
have
entirely
succeeded
as
in
part
it
did
it
would
have
entitled
sir
henry
clinton
to
very
far
superior
laurels
as
a
civilian
than
he
ever
won
as
a
soldier
the
value
of
the
americans
as
soldiers
was
very
well
known
to
the
british
general
some
of
the
most
sanguinary
battles
of
the
revolution
were
those
in
which
the
combatants
on
both
sides
were
chiefly
natives
of
the
soil
upon
which
a
portion
of
them
but
too
freely
shed
their
blood
in
a
sincere
desire
to
bolster
up
that
foreign
tyranny
that
mocked
the
generous
valor
which
it
employed
the
effect
of
this
second
proclamation
of
the
british
commander
was
such
as
he
scarcely
anticipated
the
readiness
with
which
numbers
of
the
people
had
accepted
paroles
and
protections
declared
at
most
nothing
but
their
indifference
to
the
contest
declared
no
preference
for
british
domination
in
this
lay
the
error
of
the
conqueror
the
natural
feeling
of
the
people
thus
entrapped
was
that
of
indignation
their
determination
might
have
been
conjectured
by
any
reasoning
mind
compelled
to
take
up
arms
not
permitted
to
enjoy
that
repose
with
their
families
for
which
they
sought
the
offered
immunities
of
the
british
it
was
more
easy
to
espouse
the
cause
of
their
countrymen
to
which
their
affections
were
really
given
than
that
of
the
invader
they
had
committed
a
great
and
humbling
error
in
the
endeavor
to
escape
the
conflict
in
taking
the
proffered
protection
of
a
power
which
had
seized
with
violence
upon
their
native
land
it
was
with
some
eagerness
therefore
that
they
threw
aside
its
obligations
and
as
opportunity
presented
itself
girded
on
their
armor
and
sallied
forth
to
join
their
countrymen
among
the
first
to
do
so
were
the
men
by
whom
marion
was
summoned
from
the
camp
of
gates
these
brave
fellows
occupying
a
portion
of
the
country
stretching
from
the
santee
to
the
pedee
including
the
whole
of
the
present
district
of
williamsburg
and
a
part
of
marion
were
not
altogether
prepared
to
understand
these
british
proclamations
they
were
no
great
politicians
had
no
love
of
blind
vassalage
and
naturally
suspected
all
liberality
of
british
origin
they
wished
for
certain
explanations
before
they
sent
in
their
adhesion
not
that
they
calculated
upon
resistance
this
no
doubt
seemed
to
them
as
hopeless
as
it
appeared
in
all
other
parts
of
the
state
but
their
insulated
position
which
left
them
uninformed
as
to
the
true
condition
of
things
was
at
the
same
time
a
source
of
their
courage
and
indifference
as
yet
the
arms
of
the
british
had
not
penetrated
into
their
settlements
they
were
naturally
anxious
to
prevent
their
doing
so
under
these
circumstances
they
held
a
gathering
of
their
best
men
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
upon
their
affairs
the
twin
proclamations
how
unlike
of
the
british
commander
were
before
them
and
in
their
primitive
assembly
they
sat
down
to
discuss
their
separate
merits
these
confused
rather
than
enlightened
them
and
it
was
resolved
to
send
one
of
their
number
in
whom
they
had
most
confidence
to
the
nearest
british
authority
in
order
that
their
difficulties
should
be
explained
and
their
doubts
satisfied
there
was
one
sterling
family
among
them
of
the
name
of
james
of
this
family
there
were
five
brothers
john
william
gavin
robert
and
james
no
men
under
marion
were
braver
or
truer
than
these
fearless
strong
and
active
they
were
always
ready
for
the
foe
the
first
in
attack
the
last
in
retreat
there
were
other
branches
of
this
family
who
partook
largely
of
the
qualities
of
the
five
brothers
of
these
the
eldest
major
john
james
was
chosen
the
representative
of
the
men
of
williamsburg
this
gentleman
had
been
their
representative
in
the
provincial
assembly
he
was
in
command
of
them
as
state
militia
they
gave
him
their
fullest
confidence
and
he
deserved
it
under
this
appointment
major
james
repaired
to
georgetown
the
nearest
british
post
which
was
then
under
the
command
of
one
captain
ardesoif
attired
as
a
plain
backwoodsman
james
obtained
an
interview
with
ardesoif
and
in
prompt
and
plain
terms
entered
at
once
upon
the
business
for
which
he
came
but
when
he
demanded
the
meaning
of
the
british
protection
and
asked
upon
what
terms
the
submission
of
the
citizens
was
to
be
made
he
was
peremptorily
informed
that
the
submission
must
be
unconditional
to
an
inquiry
whether
the
inhabitants
were
to
be
allowed
to
remain
upon
their
plantations
he
was
answered
in
the
negative
his
majesty
said
ardesoif
offers
you
a
free
pardon
of
which
you
are
undeserving
for
you
all
ought
to
be
hanged
but
it
is
only
on
condition
that
you
take
up
arms
in
his
cause
james
whom
we
may
suppose
to
have
been
very
far
from
relishing
the
tone
and
language
in
which
he
was
addressed
very
coolly
replied
that
the
people
whom
he
came
to
represent
would
scarcely
submit
on
such
conditions
the
republican
language
of
the
worthy
major
provoked
the
representative
of
royalty
the
word
in
particular
smote
hardly
on
his
ears
something
too
in
the
cool
contemptuous
manner
of
the
major
may
have
contributed
to
his
vexation
represent
he
exclaimed
in
a
fury
you
d
d
rebel
if
you
dare
speak
in
such
language
i
will
have
you
hung
up
at
the
ardesoif
it
must
be
known
was
a
sea
captain
the
ship
which
he
commanded
lay
in
the
neighboring
river
he
used
only
a
habitual
form
of
speech
when
he
threatened
the
instead
of
the
tree
major
james
gave
him
no
time
to
make
the
correction
he
was
entirely
weaponless
and
ardesoif
wore
a
sword
but
the
inequality
in
the
moment
of
his
anger
was
unfelt
by
the
citizen
suddenly
rising
he
seized
upon
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
and
floored
the
insolent
subordinate
at
a
blow
then
hurrying
forth
without
giving
his
enemy
time
to
recover
he
mounted
his
horse
and
made
his
escape
to
the
woods
before
pursuit
could
be
attempted
his
people
were
soon
assembled
to
hear
his
story
the
exactions
of
the
british
and
the
spirit
which
james
had
displayed
in
resenting
the
insolence
of
ardesoif
at
once
aroused
their
own
required
to
take
the
field
it
did
not
need
a
moment
to
decide
under
which
king
the
result
of
their
deliberations
was
the
formation
of
marion
brigade
four
captains
were
chosen
for
as
many
companies
these
were
captains
william
henry
mouzon
john
james
of
the
lake
a
cousin
of
major
james
and
john
these
were
all
under
the
one
command
of
our
representative
to
ardesoif
he
instantly
put
them
into
motion
and
after
some
petty
successes
against
small
parties
of
british
and
tories
he
advanced
one
of
the
four
companies
to
the
pass
of
lynch
creek
at
witherspoon
ferry
here
heard
of
tarleton
and
proceeded
to
encounter
him
tarleton
had
been
apprised
of
the
gatherings
at
williamsburg
and
at
the
head
of
some
seventy
men
was
pressing
forward
with
the
hope
of
surprising
james
more
brave
perhaps
than
prudent
after
sending
back
to
james
for
a
reinforcement
set
forward
to
give
tarleton
battle
the
british
colonel
had
taken
post
at
kingstree
approached
him
at
midnight
it
happened
perhaps
fortunately
for
the
former
that
tarleton
had
received
some
very
exaggerated
accounts
of
force
which
the
boldness
of
his
approach
seemed
to
confirm
taking
the
alarm
accordingly
he
disappeared
in
season
leaving
to
the
which
necessarily
attended
his
attempt
the
excesses
of
tarleton
while
on
this
progress
and
the
crimes
committed
in
the
same
neighborhood
by
other
british
captains
about
the
same
time
completed
the
movement
which
the
native
spirit
of
patriotism
in
the
men
of
williamsburg
had
so
happily
begun
the
whole
country
was
soon
awakened
individuals
and
groups
everywhere
beginning
to
show
themselves
in
arms
and
nothing
was
needed
but
an
embodied
force
of
the
americans
upon
which
they
could
concentrate
themselves
and
rally
with
effect
it
was
on
the
or
of
august
some
four
days
before
the
defeat
of
gates
that
marion
reached
the
post
at
lynch
creek
where
had
taken
his
position
he
was
commissioned
by
governor
rutledge
to
take
command
of
the
country
in
this
quarter
and
we
will
henceforth
distinguish
him
as
general
marion
although
it
is
not
so
certain
at
what
period
he
actually
received
this
promotion
we
find
him
in
possession
of
it
in
the
following
december
of
his
personal
appearance
at
this
time
we
have
a
brief
but
striking
account
from
the
hands
of
the
venerable
judge
james
a
son
of
the
major
who
had
the
honor
to
serve
under
marion
at
the
age
of
fifteen
he
was
a
stranger
says
the
judge
to
the
officers
and
men
and
they
flocked
about
him
to
obtain
a
sight
of
their
future
commander
he
was
rather
below
the
middle
stature
lean
and
swarthy
his
body
was
well
set
but
his
knees
and
ankles
were
badly
formed
and
he
still
limped
upon
one
leg
he
had
a
countenance
remarkably
steady
his
nose
was
aquiline
his
chin
projecting
his
forehead
large
and
high
and
his
eyes
black
and
piercing
he
was
then
years
of
age
with
a
frame
capable
of
enduring
fatigue
and
every
privation
of
his
dress
by
which
we
may
form
some
idea
of
that
costume
which
had
provoked
the
laughter
of
gates
veterans
we
have
a
description
also
furnished
us
by
the
same
excellent
authority
we
know
not
but
that
this
description
will
provoke
the
smile
of
the
reader
but
of
such
persons
in
the
language
of
the
judge
even
trifles
become
important
he
marion
was
dressed
in
a
close
crimson
jacket
of
a
coarse
texture
and
wore
a
leather
cap
part
of
the
uniform
of
the
second
regiment
with
a
silver
crescent
in
front
inscribed
with
the
words
or
death
such
regimentals
show
rather
the
exigencies
than
the
tastes
of
our
partisan
this
scarlet
cloth
of
which
his
vest
was
made
was
almost
the
only
kind
of
color
which
the
carolinians
could
procure
after
the
conquest
of
charleston
the
british
seemed
to
distribute
it
with
the
protections
and
pardons
perhaps
as
a
popular
mode
of
disseminating
their
principles
moultrie
somewhere
tells
a
ludicrous
anecdote
of
some
americans
prisoners
on
parole
who
were
nearly
cut
to
pieces
by
a
party
of
their
countrymen
in
consequence
of
their
scarlet
jackets
they
had
taken
the
precaution
to
dye
them
with
some
native
roots
but
the
dye
had
disappeared
leaving
the
original
color
nearly
as
vivid
as
before
according
to
weems
marion
made
rather
a
theatrical
display
on
taking
command
of
his
brigade
he
swore
them
in
a
circle
upon
their
swords
never
to
yield
the
contest
until
they
had
secured
their
own
and
the
liberties
of
their
country
there
is
no
authority
for
this
statement
either
in
the
work
of
james
in
the
of
horry
or
in
any
of
the
authorities
there
is
no
doubt
that
such
were
his
own
sentiments
and
such
the
sentiments
which
he
strove
to
impart
to
all
his
followers
but
the
scene
as
described
by
the
reverend
historian
was
quite
too
artificial
and
theatrical
for
the
tastes
of
marion
it
does
not
accord
with
what
we
know
of
his
modesty
his
unaffected
nature
and
the
general
simplicity
of
his
manners
he
instilled
his
lessons
by
examples
rather
than
by
speeches
his
words
were
usually
very
few
he
secured
the
fidelity
of
his
men
by
carrying
them
bravely
into
action
and
bringing
them
honorably
out
of
it
marion
career
of
activity
commenced
with
his
command
though
always
prudent
he
yet
learned
that
prudence
in
military
life
must
always
imply
activity
the
insecurity
of
the
encampment
with
a
militia
force
is
always
greater
than
that
of
battle
the
roman
captains
of
celebrity
were
particularly
aware
of
this
truth
but
the
activity
of
marion
was
necessarily
straitened
by
the
condition
in
which
he
found
his
men
they
were
wretchedly
deficient
in
all
the
materials
of
service
his
first
effort
to
supply
some
of
their
wants
was
in
sacking
the
the
saws
were
wrought
and
hammered
by
rude
blacksmiths
into
some
resemblance
to
sabres
and
thus
provided
marion
set
his
men
in
motion
two
days
after
taking
the
command
crossing
the
pedee
at
port
ferry
he
advanced
upon
a
large
body
of
tories
commanded
by
major
gainey
who
held
a
position
upon
britton
neck
gainey
was
considered
by
the
british
an
excellent
partisan
officer
but
he
was
caught
napping
marion
moved
with
equal
secrecy
and
celerity
after
riding
all
night
he
came
upon
the
enemy
at
dawn
in
the
morning
the
discovery
and
the
attack
were
one
the
surprise
was
complete
a
captain
and
several
privates
were
slain
and
the
party
dispersed
marion
did
not
lose
a
man
and
had
but
two
wounded
in
this
engagement
our
representative
major
james
distinguished
himself
by
singling
out
major
gainey
for
personal
combat
but
gainey
shrank
from
his
more
powerful
assailant
and
sought
safety
in
flight
james
pursued
for
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
in
the
eagerness
of
the
chase
he
did
not
perceive
that
he
was
alone
and
unsupported
it
was
enough
that
he
was
gaining
upon
his
enemy
who
was
almost
within
reach
of
his
sword
when
the
chase
brought
them
suddenly
upon
a
body
of
tories
who
had
rallied
upon
the
road
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
hesitation
would
have
been
fatal
but
our
gallant
major
was
not
to
be
easily
intimidated
with
great
coolness
and
presence
of
mind
waving
his
sword
aloft
he
cried
out
come
on
boys
here
they
are
and
rushed
headlong
upon
the
group
of
enemies
as
if
perfectly
assured
of
support
the
ruse
was
successful
the
tories
broke
once
more
and
sought
safety
from
their
individual
enemy
in
the
recesses
of
pedee
swamp
marion
did
not
suffer
the
courage
of
his
men
to
cool
in
hours
after
this
event
he
was
again
in
motion
hearing
of
the
proximity
of
another
body
of
tories
under
captain
barfield
he
advanced
against
him
with
as
much
celerity
and
caution
as
before
but
he
found
barfield
strongly
posted
in
greater
force
than
he
expected
warned
of
his
approach
and
waiting
for
him
it
was
no
part
of
marion
practice
to
expose
his
men
unnecessarily
he
had
too
few
to
risk
the
loss
of
any
precious
lives
where
this
was
to
be
avoided
he
determined
upon
a
different
mode
of
managing
his
enemy
and
resorted
to
a
stratagem
which
subsequently
he
frequently
made
use
of
putting
a
select
party
of
his
men
in
ambush
near
the
blue
savannah
he
feigned
retreat
with
another
and
thus
beguiled
his
enemy
from
his
strong
position
the
result
accorded
with
his
wishes
barfield
followed
and
fell
into
the
snare
the
defeat
was
equally
complete
with
that
of
gainey
the
conduct
and
skill
in
managing
his
raw
which
these
two
achievements
displayed
naturally
inspired
his
followers
with
confidence
in
themselves
and
their
leader
they
produced
a
corresponding
effect
upon
the
people
of
the
country
and
were
productive
of
no
small
annoyance
to
the
tories
who
were
thus
suddenly
reminded
that
there
might
be
retribution
for
crime
even
when
sheltered
under
the
dragon
folds
of
england
another
benefit
from
these
occurrences
was
in
better
providing
the
brigade
with
some
of
the
proper
weapons
and
munitions
of
war
among
the
recent
captures
of
marion
were
two
old
returning
to
port
ferry
he
threw
up
a
redoubt
on
the
east
bank
of
the
pedee
upon
which
he
mounted
them
he
seldom
troubled
himself
with
such
heavy
baggage
and
probably
disposed
of
them
in
this
way
quite
as
much
to
disencumber
himself
of
them
as
with
any
such
motive
as
was
alleged
when
placing
them
in
battery
of
overawing
the
tories
by
their
presence
movements
of
so
rapid
a
kind
and
so
frequently
made
as
his
requiring
equal
dispatch
and
secrecy
forbade
the
use
of
artillery
and
he
very
well
knew
that
to
employ
men
for
the
maintenance
of
isolated
posts
such
posts
as
he
could
establish
would
have
no
other
effect
than
to
expose
his
brigade
to
the
chances
of
being
cut
up
in
detail
on
the
august
the
day
following
the
defeat
of
gates
of
which
event
he
was
as
yet
wholly
ignorant
he
dispatched
peter
horry
with
orders
to
take
command
of
four
companies
bonneau
mitchell
benson
and
lenud
near
georgetown
on
the
santee
to
destroy
all
the
boats
and
canoes
on
the
river
from
the
lower
ferry
to
lenud
to
break
up
and
stop
all
communications
with
charleston
and
to
procure
if
possible
supplies
of
gunpowder
flints
and
bullets
weight
of
gunpowder
ball
or
buckshot
is
the
language
of
his
orders
this
will
show
how
scanty
were
the
supplies
which
were
to
be
procured
of
the
material
upon
which
everything
depended
marion
frequently
went
into
action
with
less
than
three
rounds
to
a
man
half
of
his
men
were
sometimes
lookers
on
because
of
the
lack
of
arms
and
ammunition
waiting
to
see
the
fall
of
friends
or
enemies
in
order
to
obtain
the
necessary
means
of
taking
part
in
the
affair
easily
satisfied
soldiers
who
not
unfrequently
advanced
to
the
combat
with
nothing
but
in
their
while
horry
proceeded
towards
georgetown
marion
marched
to
the
upper
santee
on
this
march
he
was
advised
of
the
defeat
of
gates
but
fearing
its
effect
upon
his
men
without
communicating
it
he
proceeded
immediately
toward
nelson
ferry
this
was
a
well
known
pass
on
the
great
route
the
from
charleston
to
camden
here
his
scouts
advised
him
of
the
approach
of
a
strong
british
guard
with
a
large
body
of
prisoners
taken
from
gates
the
guards
had
stopped
at
a
house
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
informed
of
all
necessary
particulars
marion
a
little
before
daylight
detached
hugh
horry
with
sixteen
men
to
gain
possession
of
the
road
at
the
pass
of
horse
creek
in
the
swamp
while
the
main
body
under
himself
was
to
attack
the
enemy
rear
the
attempt
was
made
at
dawn
and
was
perfectly
successful
a
letter
from
marion
himself
to
horry
thus
details
the
event
on
the
inst
i
attacked
a
guard
of
the
and
prince
of
wales
regiment
with
a
number
of
tories
at
the
great
savannah
near
nelson
ferry
killed
and
took
regulars
and
two
tories
prisoners
and
retook
one
hundred
and
fifty
continentals
of
the
maryland
line
one
wagon
and
a
drum
one
captain
and
a
subaltern
were
also
captured
our
loss
is
one
killed
and
captain
benson
is
slightly
wounded
on
the
head
it
will
scarcely
be
believed
that
of
this
hundred
and
fifty
continentals
but
three
men
consented
to
join
the
ranks
of
their
liberator
it
may
be
that
they
were
somewhat
loth
to
be
led
even
though
it
were
to
victory
by
the
man
whose
ludicrous
equipments
and
followers
but
a
few
weeks
before
had
only
provoked
their
merriment
the
reason
given
for
their
refusal
however
was
not
deficient
in
force
they
considered
the
cause
of
the
country
to
be
hopeless
they
were
risking
life
without
an
adequate
object
the
defeat
of
gates
and
his
bad
generalship
which
they
had
so
recently
witnessed
were
perhaps
quite
sufficient
reasons
to
justify
their
misgivings
this
disastrous
event
did
not
produce
like
despondency
in
our
partisan
or
his
followers
though
it
furnished
reasons
for
the
greatest
circumspection
at
this
moment
marion
was
the
only
body
of
american
troops
in
the
state
openly
opposed
to
the
triumphant
progress
of
the
british
the
continentals
were
dispersed
or
captured
the
virginia
and
north
carolina
militia
scattered
to
the
four
winds
sumter
legion
cut
up
by
tarleton
and
he
himself
a
fugitive
fearless
and
active
still
but
as
yet
seeking
rather
than
commanding
a
force
though
small
and
seemingly
insignificant
the
force
of
marion
had
shown
what
might
be
done
with
the
spirit
and
the
personnel
of
the
country
under
competent
leaders
the
cruelties
of
the
british
who
subjected
the
vanquished
to
the
worst
treatment
of
war
helped
his
endeavors
shortly
after
the
victory
over
gates
lord
cornwallis
addressed
an
order
to
the
british
commandants
at
the
several
posts
throughout
the
country
of
which
the
following
are
extracts
i
have
given
orders
that
all
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
province
who
have
subscribed
and
have
taken
part
in
this
revolt
should
be
punished
with
the
greatest
rigor
and
also
those
who
will
not
turn
out
that
they
may
be
imprisoned
and
their
whole
property
taken
from
them
or
destroyed
i
have
ordered
in
the
most
positive
manner
that
every
militia
man
who
has
borne
arms
with
us
and
afterwards
joined
the
enemy
shall
be
immediately
hanged
this
gentleman
has
been
called
by
some
of
the
american
writers
the
amiable
cornwallis
it
is
rather
difficult
to
say
for
which
of
his
qualities
this
dulcet
epithet
was
bestowed
the
preceding
may
well
justify
us
in
the
doubt
we
venture
to
express
whether
it
was
not
given
as
much
in
mockery
as
compliment
but
lest
his
commands
should
not
be
understood
as
not
sufficiently
explicit
his
lordship
proceeded
to
furnish
examples
of
his
meaning
which
left
his
desires
beyond
reasonable
question
immediately
after
his
return
to
camden
he
stained
the
laurels
of
his
recent
victory
and
celebrated
his
triumph
over
gates
by
hanging
some
twelve
or
fifteen
wretched
prisoners
old
men
and
boys
who
were
only
suspected
of
treachery
to
the
royal
cause
similar
barbarities
were
practised
by
subordinate
officers
emulative
of
this
example
of
their
superior
or
in
obedience
to
his
orders
but
fortunately
for
the
country
even
this
brutality
which
was
intended
to
alarm
the
fears
of
the
people
and
do
that
which
the
arts
of
their
conqueror
had
failed
to
effect
was
not
productive
of
the
desired
results
it
drove
the
indignant
into
the
field
it
shamed
the
unwilling
into
decision
it
spurred
on
the
inert
and
inactive
to
exertion
and
armed
the
doubtful
and
the
timid
with
resolution
it
sent
hundreds
whom
nothing
had
moved
before
into
the
ranks
of
marion
and
sumter
the
moment
of
defeat
and
greatest
despondency
the
dark
before
the
dawn
was
that
when
the
people
of
the
country
were
preparing
to
display
the
most
animating
signs
of
life
the
very
fact
that
the
force
of
marion
was
so
insignificant
was
something
in
favor
of
that
courage
and
patriotism
that
confidence
in
his
own
resources
and
his
men
which
defying
all
the
inequalities
of
force
could
move
him
to
traverse
the
very
paths
of
the
conqueror
and
pluck
his
prisoners
from
his
very
grasp
the
audacity
and
skill
of
marion
exhibited
in
numerous
small
achievements
of
which
history
furnishes
no
particulars
extorted
a
reluctant
confession
from
the
enemy
whose
unwilling
language
will
suffice
for
our
own
tarleton
writes
marion
by
his
zeal
and
abilities
showed
himself
capable
of
the
trust
committed
to
his
charge
he
collected
his
adherents
at
the
shortest
notice
and
after
making
excursions
into
the
friendly
districts
or
threatening
the
communications
to
avoid
pursuit
he
disbanded
his
followers
the
alarms
occasioned
by
these
insurrections
frequently
retarded
supplies
on
their
way
to
the
army
and
a

of

of
the
recruits

had
arrived
from

up

and

and
darting
to
and
fro
between
the
british
posts
which
he
had
not
the
power
to
overcome
showed
that
nothing
but
that
power
was
necessary
to
enable
him
to
challenge
with
them
the
possession
of
the
soil
that
he
should
disband
his
men
at
one
moment
and
be
able
by
a
word
to
bring
them
together
when
they
were
again
wanted
proves
a
singular
alliance
between
the
chieftain
and
his
followers
which
is
characteristic
only
of
the
most
romantic
history
it
shows
a
power
on
the
part
of
the
former
such
as
we
ascribe
to
the
winding
of
the
magic
horn
of
astolfo
which
few
commanders
of
militia
have
ever
had
the
skill
to
produce
evidently
the
personal
and
patriotic
influences
were
very
equally
strong
to
occasion
such
prompt
fidelity
in
his
case
on
the
part
of
his
followers
the
british
officers
betrayed
a
singular
reluctance
to
accord
to
the
americans
their
military
titles
the
reader
will
recollect
the
letter
of
general
gage
to
washington
which
the
latter
very
properly
refused
to
receive
the
very
attempt
here
made
to
sneer
away
the
official
adds
to
the
personal
importance
of
the
individual
and
we
yield
to
plain
marion
with
his
ragged
followers
who
untitled
could
give
such
annoyance
to
his
majesty
officers

and
his
cooperation
with
wemyss
prevented
the
latter
pushed

advance
with
equal
spirit
and

marion
had
with
him
but
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
when
he
heard
of
the
approach
of
his
enemies
his
force
it
must
be
remembered
was
of
a
peculiar
kind
and
was
constantly
fluctuating
his
men
had
cares
other
than
those
of
their
country
liberties
young
and
tender
families
were
to
be
provided
for
and
guarded
in
the
thickets
where
they
found
shelter
these
were
often
threatened
in
the
absence
of
their
protectors
by
marauding
bands
of
tories
who
watched
the
moment
of
the
departure
of
the
whigs
to
rise
upon
the
weak
and
rob
and
harass
the
unprotected
the
citizen
soldiery
were
thus
doubly
employed
and
had
cares
to
endure
and
duties
to
perform
from
which
regular
troops
are
usually
exempt
and
for
which
regular
officers
seldom
make
allowance
the
good
judgment
of
marion
taking
these
necessities
into
consideration
exercised
that
patience
with
the
militia
which
secured
their
fidelity
when
he
found
this
or
that
body
of
men
anxious
about
their
families
he
yielded
most
generally
without
reluctance
to
their
wishes
this
indulgence
had
its
effects
their
return
was
certain
they
seldom
lingered
beyond
the
time
at
which
they
had
pledged
themselves
to
reappear
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
indulgence
that
his
force
was
thus
reduced
when
the
british
approach
was
known
wemyss
was
in
command
of
the
regiment
he
was
accompanied
by
a
large
body
of
tories
under
major
harrison
they
moved
with
caution
and
speed
but
the
american
general
was
on
the
alert
he
dispatched
major
james
with
a
select
body
of
volunteers
to
reconnoitre
his
various
outposts
were
called
in
and
with
his
whole
present
strength
thus
united
marion
followed
on
the
footsteps
of
james
prepared
if
the
chances
promised
him
success
for
doing
battle
with
his
enemy
major
james
meanwhile
who
was
equally
bold
and
skilful
pressed
forward
fearlessly
till
he
became
aware
of
the
proximity
of
the
british
he
was
resolved
to
make
sure
of
his
intelligence
he
placed
himself
in
a
thicket
on
their
line
of
march
and
by
a
bright
moon
was
readily
enabled
to
form
a
very
correct
notion
of
their
character
and
numbers
but
as
the
passed
by
his
courageous
spirit
prompted
further
performances
he
was
not
content
to
carry
to
his
general
no
other
proofs
of
his
vigilance
but
the
tidings
which
he
had
obtained
his
perfect
knowledge
of
the
ground
his
confidence
in
the
excellent
character
of
his
men
and
the
speed
of
their
horses
moved
him
to
greater
daring
and
bursting
from
his
with
a
terrible
shout
he
swooped
down
with
his
small
party
upon
the
startled
stragglers
in
the
rear
of
the
tory
march
carrying
off
his
prisoners
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
without
stopping
to
slay
and
without
suffering
the
loss
of
a
man
before
the
enemy
could
rally
and
turn
upon
his
path
the
tread
of
the
partisan
horse
no
longer
sounded
in
his
ears
the
intelligence
which
james
bore
to
his
commander
was
scarcely
so
encouraging
he
reported
the
british
regulars
to
be
double
their
own
force
in
number
while
the
tories
in
the
rear
were
alone
estimated
at
five
hundred
men
retreat
perhaps
dispersion
was
now
inevitable
this
was
the
sort
of
game
which
in
his
feebleness
and
under
the
pressure
of
a
very
superior
foe
our
partisan
was
compelled
to
play
it
was
sometimes
a
humiliating
one
and
always
attended
with
some
discouragements
the
evil
effects
however
were
only
temporary
his
men
never
retired
beyond
his
reach
they
came
again
at
a
call
refreshed
by
the
respite
and
assured
by
the
conviction
that
their
commander
was
quite
as
careful
of
their
lives
as
themselves
such
a
game
was
not
without
its
interest
and
its
peculiarities
were
such
as
to
give
animation
to
the
valor
which
it
exercised
in
these
peculiarities
of
his
warfare
lies
that
secret
charm
which
has
made
tradition
in
the
southern
country
linger
so
long
and
so
fondly
upon
the
name
of
marion
judge
james
gives
us
in
few
words
a
lively
idea
of
the
consultation
which
followed
the
return
and
the
report
of
major
james
about
an
hour
before
day
marion
met
the
major
half
a
mile
from
his
plantation
the
officers
immediately
dismounted
and
retired
to
consult
the
men
sat
on
their
horses
in
a
state
of
anxious
suspense
the
conference
was
long
and
animated
at
the
end
of
it
an
order
was
given
to
direct
the
march
back
to
lynch
creek
the
route
to
north
carolina
and
no
sooner
was
it
given
than
a
bitter
groan
might
have
been
heard
along
the
whole
line
a
bitter
cup
had
now
been
mingled
for
the
people
of
williamsburg
and
pedee
and
they
were
doomed
to
drain
it
to
the
dregs
but
in
the
end
it
proved
a
salutary
medicine
the
evil
here
deplored
was
the
temporary
abandonment
for
the
first
time
of
this
particular
section
of
country
hitherto
the
enemy
had
never
appeared
in
their
neighborhood
with
such
a
force
as
enabled
them
to
overrun
it
without
fear
of
opposition
now
they
were
destined
to
suffer
from
those
tender
mercies
of
british
and
tories
which
had
written
their
chronicles
in
blood
and
flame
wherever
their
footsteps
had
gone
before
bitter
indeed
was
the
medicine
to
whom
its
taste
was
new
but
as
writes
the
venerable
biographer
it
was
salutary
in
the
end
it
strengthened
their
souls
for
the
future
trial
it
made
them
more
resolute
in
the
play
with
their
own
houses
in
smoking
ruins
and
their
own
wives
and
children
homeless
and
wandering
they
could
better
feel
what
was
due
to
the
sufferings
of
their
common
country
it
was
at
sunset
the
next
evening
that
marion
commenced
his
flight
to
north
carolina
he
kept
with
him
only
sixty
men
the
rest
dropped
off
by
degrees
as
they
approached
their
several
lying
snug
until
they
again
heard
the
signal
of
their
commander
frequently
nothing
but
a
whisper
which
once
more
brought
them
forth
to
turn
the
pursuit
upon
their
enemies
and
avenge
themselves
by
sudden
onslaught
for
the
ruin
of
their
homesteads
on
this
retreat
marion
took
with
him
the
two
which
we
found
him
placing
in
battery
on
the
pedee
a
short
time
before
his
desire
to
save
these
pieces
was
due
rather
to
the
supposed
effect
which
their
possession
had
upon
the
minds
of
the
tories
than
because
of
any
real
intrinsic
use
which
they
possessed
in
his
hands
they
encumbered
his
flight
however
and
he
disposed
of
them
finally
without
compunction
wheeling
them
into
a
swamp
he
left
them
where
possibly
they
remain
to
this
day
the
object
of
occasional
start
and
wonderment
to
the
stalking
this
says
judge
james
was
the
last
instance
of
military
parade
evinced
by
the
general
marching
day
and
night
he
arrived
at
amy
mill
on
drowning
creek
from
this
place
he
sent
forth
his
parties
back
to
south
carolina
to
gain
intelligence
and
rouse
the
militia
he
himself
continued
his
march
he
pitched
his
camp
finally
on
the
east
side
of
the
white
marsh
near
the
head
of
the
waccamaw
there
may
have
been
a
motive
other
than
the
desire
for
safety
which
led
marion
to
choose
and
retain
this
position
the
borders
of
north
carolina
swarmed
with
tories
chiefly
descendants
of
the
scotch
who
constituted
on
frequent
subsequent
occasions
the
perplexing
enemies
with
whom
our
partisan
had
to
contend
it
is
not
improbable
though
history
does
not
declare
the
fact
that
he
chose
the
present
occasion
for
overawing
the
scattered
parties
who
were
always
stretching
with
lawless
footsteps
from
cape
fear
to
the
great
pedee
it
was
while
he
lay
at
this
place
that
the
venerable
judge
james
then
a
boy
of
sixteen
had
the
honor
for
the
first
time
to
dine
with
marion
it
was
in
the
absence
of
major
james
the
father
of
the
boy
who
was
one
of
the
volunteers
sent
back
to
south
carolina
the
artless
description
which
the
judge
has
given
us
of
this
event
so
characteristic
of
marion
and
of
the
necessities
to
which
he
was
habitually
compelled
to
submit
will
better
please
than
a
much
more
elaborate
narrative
the
dinner
was
set
before
the
company
by
the
general
servant
oscar
partly
on
a
pine
log
and
partly
on
the
ground
it
consisted
of
lean
beef
without
salt
and
sweet
potatoes
the
author
had
left
a
small
pot
of
boiled
hominy
in
his
camp
and
requested
leave
of
his
host
to
send
for
it
and
the
proposal
was
gladly
acquiesced
in
the
hominy
had
salt
in
it
and
proved
though
eaten
out
of
the
pot
a
most
acceptable
repast
the
general
said
but
little
and
that
was
chiefly
what
a
son
would
be
most
likely
to
be
gratified
by
in
the
praise
of
his
father
we
had
nothing
to
drink
but
bad
water
and
all
the
company
appeared
to
be
rather
grave
that
the
party
should
be
rather
grave
flying
from
their
homes
and
a
superior
foe
eating
unsalted
pottage
and
drinking
bad
water
was
perhaps
natural
enough
that
this
gravity
should
appear
doubly
impressive
to
a
lad
of
sixteen
in
a
presence
which
he
was
taught
to
venerate
was
still
more
likely
to
be
the
case
but
marion
though
a
cheerful
man
wore
ordinarily
a
grave
sedate
expression
of
countenance
never
darkened
by
gloom
it
was
seldom
usurped
by
mere
merriment
he
had
no
uproarious
humor
his
tastes
were
delicate
his
habits
gentle
his
sensibilities
warm
and
watchful
at
most
a
quiet
smile
lighted
up
his
features
and
he
could
deal
in
little
gushes
of
humor
of
which
there
was
a
precious
fountain
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
he
was
capable
of
a
sharp
sarcasm
was
also
generally
understood
among
his
friends
horry
remarks
that
few
men
ever
excelled
him
at
retort
but
he
was
singularly
considerate
of
the
sensibilities
of
others
and
had
his
temper
under
rare
command
his
powers
of
forbearance
were
remarkable
his
demeanor
whether
in
triumph
or
despondency
was
equally
quiet
and
subdued
he
yielded
to
few
excitements
was
seldom
elevated
by
successes
to
imprudence
as
seldom
depressed
by
disappointments
to
despondency
the
equable
tone
of
his
mind
reminds
us
again
of
washington
it
was
while
marion
remained
at
white
marsh
that
one
of
his
captains
gavin
witherspoon
whom
he
had
sent
out
with
four
men
achieved
one
of
those
clever
performances
that
so
frequently
distinguished
the
men
of
marion
he
had
taken
refuge
in
pedee
swamp
from
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
and
while
hiding
discovered
one
of
the
camps
of
the
tories
who
had
been
in
pursuit
of
him
witherspoon
proposed
to
his
four
comrades
to
watch
the
enemy
camp
until
the
tories
were
asleep
but
his
men
timidly
shrunk
from
the
performance
expressing
their
dread
of
superior
numbers
witherspoon
undertook
the
adventure
himself
creeping
up
to
the
encampment
he
found
that
they
slept
at
the
butt
of
a
pine
tree
which
had
been
torn
up
by
the
roots
their
guns
were
piled
against
one
of
its
branches
at
a
little
distance
from
them
these
he
first
determined
to
secure
and
still
creeping
with
the
skill
and
caution
of
an
experienced
scout
he
succeeded
in
his
object
the
guns
once
in
his
possession
he
aroused
the
tories
by
commanding
their
surrender
they
were
seven
in
number
unarmed
and
knew
nothing
of
the
force
of
the
assailant
his
own
more
timid
followers
drew
near
in
sufficient
time
to
assist
in
securing
the
prisoners
there
was
another
witherspoon
with
marion
john
a
brother
of
gavin
and
like
him
distinguished
for
great
coolness
strength
and
courage
both
of
the
brothers
delighted
in
such
adventures
and
were
always
ready
to
engage
in
them
the
rashness
of
the
attempt
giving
a
sort
of
relish
to
the
danger
which
always
sweetened
it
to
the
taste
of
our
partisans
the
return
of
the
various
scouting
parties
which
marion
sent
out
soon
set
his
little
brigade
in
motion
the
intelligence
which
they
brought
was
well
calculated
to
sting
his
soldiers
as
well
as
himself
into
immediate
activity
the
medicine
which
the
british
had
administered
to
the
country
they
abandoned
had
not
been
suffered
to
lose
any
of
its
bitterness
as
had
been
feared
the
tories
had
laid
waste
the
farms
and
plantations
the
region
through
which
major
wemyss
had
passed
for
seventy
miles
in
length
and
fifteen
in
breadth
displayed
one
broad
face
of
desolation
it
had
been
swept
by
sword
and
fire
havoc
had
exercised
its
most
ingenious
powers
of
destruction
on
most
of
the
plantations
the
houses
were
given
to
the
flames
the
inhabitants
plundered
of
all
their
possessions
and
the
stock
especially
the
sheep
wantonly
shot
or
bayoneted
wemyss
seems
to
have
been
particularly
hostile
to
looms
and
sheep
simply
because
they
supplied
the
inhabitants
with
clothing
he
seldom
suffered
the
furniture
to
be
withdrawn
from
a
dwelling
which
he
had
doomed
to
be
destroyed
presbyterian
churches
he
burnt
religiously
as
so
many
it
was
fortunate
for
the
wretched
country
thus
ravaged
that
the
corn
was
not
generally
housed
it
was
only
in
part
destroyed
had
the
tories
played
the
same
game
in
the
cornfields
of
the
patriots
that
grant
men
had
done
in
those
of
the
cherokees
as
recorded
in
an
early
page
of
this
volume
the
devastation
would
have
been
complete
they
had
not
limited
their
proceedings
to
these
minor
crimes
they
had
added
human
butchery
and
hanging
to
those
other
offences
for
which
vengeance
was
in
store
the
wife
and
children
of
one
adam
cusack
threw
themselves
across
the
path
of
wemyss
to
obtain
the
pardon
of
the
husband
and
the
father
the
crime
of
cusack
was
in
having
taken
arms
against
the
enemy
their
prayers
were
in
vain
but
for
the
interference
of
his
own
officers
the
ruthless
briton
would
have
ridden
over
the
kneeling
innocents
this
was
not
the
only
savage
murder
of
the
same
description
which
this
wretched
people
had
to
endure
but
such
atrocities
were
sharp
medicines
benefits
in
disguise
good
against
cowardice
selfishness
and
deficient
patriotism
they
worked
famously
upon
the
natives
while
they
proved
the
invader
to
be
as
little
capable
of
good
policy
as
of
ordinary
humanity
they
roused
the
spirit
of
the
militia
whet
their
anger
and
their
swords
together
and
by
the
time
that
marion
reappeared
they
were
ready
for
their
general
he
asked
for
nothing
more
he
south
carolina
by
a
forced
march
travelling
night
and
day
he
hurried
through
the
tory
settlements
on
little
pedee
a
space
of
sixty
miles
on
the
second
day
of
his
journey
at
lynch
creek
he
was
joined
by
captains
james
and
mouzon
with
a
considerable
body
of
men
he
was
prepared
to
give
them
instant
employment
major
wemyss
had
retired
to
georgetown
but
marion
was
advised
of
a
large
body
of
tories
at
black
mingo
fifteen
miles
below
under
the
command
of
capt
john
coming
ball
marion
was
in
expectation
every
moment
of
additional
troops
but
he
determined
not
to
wait
for
them
he
found
his
men
in
the
proper
mood
for
fight
and
at
such
times
small
inequalities
of
force
are
not
to
be
regarded
he
resolved
to
give
the
humor
vent
and
at
once
commenced
his
march
for
the
encampment
he
found
the
tories
strongly
posted
at
shepherd
ferry
on
the
south
side
of
the
black
mingo
on
a
deep
navigable
stream
the
passage
of
which
they
commanded
there
was
but
one
other
approach
to
them
about
a
mile
above
their
position
through
a
boggy
causeway
and
over
a
bridge
of
planks
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
marion
troops
reached
this
pass
while
the
horses
were
crossing
the
bridge
an
was
heard
from
the
tory
camp
celerity
now
became
as
necessary
to
success
as
caution
and
marion
ordered
his
men
to
follow
him
at
full
gallop
when
they
reached
the
main
road
about
three
hundred
yards
from
the
enemy
the
whole
force
with
the
exception
of
a
small
body
acting
as
cavalry
dismounted
a
body
of
picked
men
under
captain
waties
was
ordered
down
the
road
to
attack
dollard
house
where
the
tories
had
been
posted
two
companies
under
hugh
horry
were
sent
to
the
right
and
the
cavalry
to
the
left
to
support
the
attack
marion
himself
bringing
up
the
reserve
it
so
happened
however
that
the
tories
had
taken
the
alarm
and
having
withdrawn
from
the
house
had
chosen
a
strong
position
in
an
old
field
near
it
here
they
encountered
horry
command
on
the
advance
with
a
fire
equally
severe
and
unexpected
the
effect
was
that
of
a
surprise
upon
the
assailants
horry
troops
fell
back
in
confusion
but
were
promptly
rallied
and
brought
to
the
charge
the
battle
was
obstinate
and
bloody
but
the
appearance
of
the
corps
under
waties
suddenly
in
the
rear
of
the
tories
soon
brought
it
to
a
close
finding
themselves
between
two
fires
the
enemy
gave
way
in
all
directions
and
fled
for
refuge
to
the
neighboring
swamp
of
black
mingo
so
warmly
contested
was
this
affair
that
though
soon
over
fully
one
third
of
the
men
brought
into
the
field
were
put
de
combat
the
loss
of
marion
was
proportionably
very
considerable
captain
logan
was
among
his
slain
and
captain
mouzon
and
lieut
scott
so
severely
wounded
as
to
be
unfit
for
future
service
the
force
of
the
tories
was
almost
twice
as
great
as
that
of
the
whigs
they
lost
their
commander
and
left
nearly
half
their
number
killed
and
wounded
on
the
ground
but
for
the
alarm
given
by
the
tread
of
horses
while
crossing
the
neighboring
bridge
the
tories
would
most
probably
have
been
surprised
at
any
rate
the
affair
would
have
been
settled
without
subjecting
the
brigade
to
the
severe
loss
which
it
sustained
after
this
event
marion
adopted
the
precaution
whenever
about
to
cross
a
bridge
by
night
with
an
enemy
near
to
cover
the
planks
with
the
blankets
of
his
men
but
he
generally
preferred
fords
where
they
could
possibly
be
had
to
bridges
see
ante
pp
end
of
chapter
this
victory
was
very
complete
many
of
the
tories
came
in
and
joined
the
ranks
of
the
conqueror
those
who
did
not
were
quite
too
much
confounded
to
show
much
impatience
in
taking
up
arms
against
him
his
uniform
successes
whenever
he
struck
had
already
strongly
impressed
the
imaginations
of
the
people
his
name
was
already
the
rallying
word
throughout
the
country
to
join
marion
to
be
one
of
marion
men
was
the
duty
which
the
grandsire
imposed
upon
the
lad
and
to
the
performance
of
which
throwing
aside
his
crutch
he
led
the
way
we
have
already
shown
why
the
force
of
marion
was
so
liable
to
fluctuation
the
necessity
of
providing
for
and
protecting
destitute
families
starving
wives
and
naked
children
was
more
imperative
than
that
of
a
remote
and
fancied
liberty
these
cases
attended
to
the
militia
came
forth
struck
a
few
blows
and
once
more
returned
to
their
destitute
dependents
the
victory
over
the
tories
of
black
mingo
was
from
this
cause
followed
by
a
more
than
usually
prolonged
inactivity
of
our
partisan
his
men
demanded
a
respite
to
go
and
see
their
families
he
consented
with
some
reluctance
for
the
business
of
the
campaign
was
only
beginning
to
open
itself
before
him
they
promised
him
as
usual
to
return
in
season
but
remained
so
long
absent
that
for
the
first
time
he
now
began
to
doubt
and
despair
of
them
this
feeling
was
not
natural
with
him
it
was
probably
only
due
now
to
some
derangement
of
his
own
health
some
anxiety
to
achieve
objects
which
presented
themselves
prominently
to
his
mind
he
had
probably
heard
of
the
advance
of
general
greene
who
having
succeeded
to
gates
was
pressing
forward
with
fresh
recruits
and
the
remnant
of
the
fugitives
who
survived
in
freedom
the
fatal
battle
of
camden
a
laudable
anxiety
to
be
active
at
such
a
time
to
show
to
the
approaching
continentals
that
there
was
a
spirit
in
the
state
which
they
came
to
succor
of
which
the
most
happy
auguries
might
be
entertained
prompted
his
morbid
impatience
at
the
long
delay
of
his
absentees
there
were
other
causes
which
led
him
to
feel
this
delay
more
seriously
now
than
at
other
times
the
tories
were
again
gathering
in
force
around
him
under
these
circumstances
and
with
these
feelings
he
consulted
with
his
officers
whether
they
should
not
leave
the
state
and
join
the
approaching
army
of
greene
hugh
horry
counselled
him
strenuously
against
it
his
counsel
was
seconded
by
the
rest
they
prevailed
with
him
it
was
fortunate
that
they
did
so
for
the
great
efficiency
of
marion
was
in
the
independence
of
his
command
while
the
matter
was
yet
in
debate
the
militia
began
to
reappear
he
had
not
sufficiently
allowed
for
their
exigencies
for
the
scattered
homes
and
of
famishing
hundreds
living
on
precarious
supplies
in
swamp
and
thicket
how
could
he
reproach
them
fighting
as
they
were
for
love
of
country
only
and
under
such
privations
that
country
yielding
them
nothing
no
money
no
clothes
no
provisions
for
they
were
nothing
but
militia
they
were
not
enrolled
on
the
continental
pay
list
that
they
should
seek
the
field
at
all
thus
circumstanced
will
be
ever
a
wonder
to
that
class
of
philosophers
who
found
their
systems
upon
the
simple
doctrine
of
human
selfishness
true
to
their
chief
he
rejoiced
once
more
in
their
fidelity
and
marching
into
williamsburg
he
continued
to
increase
his
numbers
with
his
advance
his
present
object
was
the
chastisement
of
harrison
who
was
in
force
upon
lynch
creek
but
his
progress
in
this
direction
was
suddenly
arrested
by
his
scouts
who
brought
him
tidings
of
large
gatherings
of
tories
in
and
about
salem
and
the
fork
of
black
river
in
this
quarter
one
colonel
tynes
had
made
his
appearance
and
had
summoned
the
people
generally
as
good
subjects
of
his
majesty
to
take
the
field
against
their
countrymen
it
was
necessary
to
check
this
rising
and
to
scatter
it
before
it
gained
too
much
head
to
lessen
the
influence
of
tynes
and
his
party
over
those
who
were
doubtful
and
afford
the
friends
of
the
patriots
an
opportunity
to
come
out
on
the
proper
side
there
were
other
inducements
to
the
movement
tynes
had
brought
with
him
from
charleston
large
supplies
of
the
materials
of
war
and
comfort
commodities
of
which
the
poor
patriots
stood
grievously
in
need
they
hungered
at
the
tidings
brought
by
the
scouts
of
new
english
muskets
and
bayonets
and
pistols
saddles
and
bridles
powder
and
ball
which
the
provident
colonel
had
procured
from
charleston
for
fitting
out
the
new
levies
to
strike
at
this
gathering
prevent
these
new
levies
and
procure
the
supplies
which
were
designed
for
them
were
controlling
objects
to
which
all
others
were
made
to
yield
the
half
naked
troops
of
the
brigade
found
new
motives
to
valor
in
the
good
things
which
the
adventure
promised
tynes
lay
at
tarcote
in
the
forks
of
black
river
and
as
marion
was
advised
without
exercising
much
military
watchfulness
the
head
of
his
column
was
instantly
turned
in
this
direction
crossing
the
lower
ford
of
the
northern
branch
of
black
river
at
nelson
plantation
he
came
upon
the
camp
of
tynes
at
midnight
a
hurried
but
satisfactory
survey
revealed
the
position
of
the
enemy
no
preparation
had
been
made
for
safety
no
precautions
taken
against
attack
some
of
the
tories
slept
others
feasted
and
others
were
at
cards
none
watched
marion
made
his
arrangements
for
the
attack
without
obstacle
or
interruption
the
surprise
was
complete
the
panic
universal
a
few
were
slain
some
with
the
cards
in
their
hands
tynes
with
two
of
his
officers
and
many
of
his
men
were
made
prisoners
but
the
greater
number
fled
few
were
slain
as
scarcely
any
resistance
was
offered
and
tarcote
swamp
was
fortunately
nigh
to
receive
and
shelter
the
fugitives
many
of
whom
shortly
after
made
their
appearance
and
took
their
places
in
the
ranks
of
the
conqueror
marion
lost
not
a
man
the
anticipations
of
his
people
were
gratified
with
the
acquisition
of
no
small
store
of
those
supplies
arms
and
ammunition
of
which
they
had
previously
stood
in
so
much
need
these
spirited
achievements
however
small
were
so
cleverly
executed
so
unexpectedly
and
with
such
uniform
success
as
to
occasion
a
lively
sensation
through
the
country
hope
everywhere
began
to
warm
the
patriots
of
the
state
bringing
courage
along
with
it
the
effect
upon
the
enemy
of
an
opposite
temper
and
tendency
was
quite
as
lively
cornwallis
whom
we
have
already
seen
urging
tarleton
to
the
pursuit
of
our
partisan
frankly
acknowledged
his
great
merits
and
was
heard
to
say
that
he
would
give
a
good
deal
to
have
him
taken
his
language
to
sir
henry
clinton
in
a
letter
dated
from
his
camp
at
winnsborough
december
of
a
different
tone
indeed
was
of
like
tenor
it
spoke
for
the
wonderful
progress
and
influence
of
our
hero
a
progress
and
influence
not
to
be
understood
by
the
reader
from
the
meagre
account
which
we
are
enabled
to
give
of
the
battles
skirmishes
and
happy
stratagems
in
which
his
men
were
constantly
engaged
cornwallis
writes
marion
had
so
wrought
on
the
minds
of
the
people
partly
by
the
terror
of
his
threats
and
cruelty
of
his
punishments
and
partly
by
the
promise
of
plunder
that
there
was
scarcely
an
inhabitant
between
the
santee
and
pedee
that
was
not
in
arms
against
us
some
parties
had
even
crossed
the
santee
and
carried
terror
to
the
gates
of
charleston
moultrie
where
his
lordship
speaks
of
the
successes
of
marion
his
great
influence
over
the
people
and
the
audacity
with
which
they
urged
their
progress
through
all
parts
of
that
section
of
country
which
had
been
yielded
to
his
control
by
governor
rutledge
his
statement
is
true
to
the
very
letter
it
sums
up
very
happily
the
results
of
his
activity
and
conduct
but
when
his
lordship
alleges
cruelty
and
threats
and
the
hopes
of
plunder
as
the
means
by
which
these
results
were
produced
we
meet
his
assertion
with
very
flat
denial
all
the
testimonies
of
the
time
but
his
own
show
that
in
this
respect
he
wandered
very
widely
from
the
truth
no
single
specification
of
cruelty
was
ever
alleged
against
the
fair
fame
of
francis
marion
his
reputation
as
a
humane
soldier
is
beyond
reproach
and
when
questioned
always
challenged
and
invited
investigation
the
charge
made
by
cornwallis
was
urged
by
balfour
commandant
of
charleston
in
a
correspondence
with
general
moultrie
the
latter
answered
it
in
a
frank
and
confident
manner
which
showed
what
he
thought
of
it
i
am
sorry
he
writes
to
balfour
to
hear
that
general
marion
should
use
his
prisoners
ill
it
is
contrary
to
his
natural
disposition
i
know
him
to
be
generous
and
humane
he
adds
elsewhere
general
marion
always
gave
orders
to
his
men
that
there
should
be
no
waste
of
the
inhabitants
property
and
no
plundering
marion
had
lived
in
the
family
of
moultrie
had
repeatedly
served
under
him
and
if
any
man
knew
thoroughly
his
true
disposition
the
hero
of
fort
sullivan
was
certainly
that
man
but
the
testimony
of
all
who
knew
him
was
to
the
same
effect
indeed
the
gentleness
of
his
nature
made
him
a
favorite
wherever
known
touching
the
lessons
and
hopes
of
plunder
which
his
men
are
said
to
have
received
this
scarcely
requires
any
answer
we
have
seen
and
shall
see
hereafter
the
state
of
poverty
and
privation
in
which
the
brigade
of
marion
subsisted
a
few
little
facts
will
better
serve
to
show
what
their
condition
was
during
the
whole
period
in
which
we
have
seen
him
engaged
and
for
some
months
later
marion
himself
winter
and
summer
had
slept
without
the
luxury
of
a
blanket
he
had
but
one
on
taking
command
of
the
brigade
and
this
he
lost
by
accident
sleeping
soundly
after
one
of
his
forced
marches
upon
a
bed
of
pine
straw
it
took
fire
his
blanket
was
destroyed
and
he
himself
had
an
escape
so
narrow
that
one
half
of
the
cap
he
wore
was
shrivelled
up
by
the
flames
his
food
was
hominy
or
potatoes
his
drink
vinegar
and
water
of
which
he
was
fond
he
had
neither
tea
nor
coffee
and
seldom
tasted
wine
or
spirits
and
this
moderation
was
shown
at
a
time
when
he
held
in
his
possession
a
power
from
governor
rutledge
to
impress
and
appropriate
whatever
he
thought
necessary
to
his
purposes
the
charge
against
him
of
cruelty
and
plunder
is
perfectly
absurd
and
rests
on
the
vague
assertions
of
an
enemy
who
specifies
no
offence
and
offers
no
sort
of
evidence
it
was
but
natural
that
such
charges
should
be
made
by
an
astonished
and
disappointed
foe
natural
that
the
conqueror
should
ascribe
to
any
but
the
right
cause
the
reluctance
of
a
people
to
submit
to
a
monstrous
usurpation
and
their
anxiety
to
avail
themselves
by
the
presence
of
a
favorite
leader
of
a
principle
and
prospects
to
which
their
affections
were
really
surrendered
could
the
british
commanders
in
america
have
really
been
brought
to
admit
that
the
affections
of
the
people
were
not
with
their
sovereign
the
war
must
have
found
a
finish
much
sooner
than
it
did
their
hopes
were
built
upon
this
doubt
and
hence
their
anxiety
to
show
the
coercive
measures
of
the
chieftains
by
whom
this
control
adverse
to
their
wishes
was
maintained
over
the
minds
of
the
people
the
great
influence
of
marion
was
due
to
other
acts
it
was
by
the
power
of
love
and
not
of
terror
that
he
managed
his
followers
they
loved
him
for
himself
and
loved
his
cause
for
their
country
his
rare
command
of
temper
his
bland
affectionate
manner
his
calm
superiority
and
that
confidence
in
his
courage
and
conduct
as
a
leader
without
which
are
never
led
to
victory
these
were
the
sources
of
his
influence
over
them
and
of
their
successes
against
the
enemy
it
was
through
these
that
he
carried
terror
to
the
very
gates
of
charleston
we
shall
see
indeed
that
under
marion
the
militia
were
never
conducted
to
defeat

this
pleasant
duty
by
the
sincere
hope
that
he
would
get
at
mr
marion
this
however
desirable
was
no
easy
matter
marion
was
a
very
will
o
the
wisp
in
military
affairs
almost
as
difficult
to
find
at
times
by
his
own
followers
as
by
the
enemy
he
was
the
true
model
of
a
partisan
in
a
country
like
ours
of
swamp
and
thicket
leading
the
pursuing
foe
like
puck
through
bog
and
through
briar
till
he
wearied
out
his
patience
exhausted
his
resources
and
finally
laid
him
open
for
defeat
he
seldom
lingered
long
in
any
one
spot
changing
his
ground
frequently
with
indian
policy
his
scouts
well
chosen
were
always
on
the
alert
and
by
constant
activity
and
enterprise
he
not
only
baffled
pursuit
but
deprived
retreat
of
its
usual
mortifications
the
employment
which
he
thus
gave
his
men
not
only
hardened
them
against
every
turn
of
fortune
but
kept
them
always
in
good
spirits
tarleton
rose
from
a
sick
bed
to
undertake
his
capture
he
had
been
confined
for
some
time
in
charleston
with
fever
the
first
moment
of
convalescence
was
seized
upon
for
carrying
into
effect
the
wishes
of
cornwallis
he
concerted
his
plans
before
he
left
the
city
his
legion
which
was
at
camden
were
instructed
to
meet
him
while
with
a
troop
of
horse
he
set
forward
for
some
point
upon
the
wateree
from
this
point
he
was
to
descend
the
wateree
in
quest
of
our
partisan
his
plan
of
pursuit
as
furnished
by
his
own
pen
will
be
seen
hereafter
marion
was
not
unadvised
of
his
progress
but
either
from
the
rapidity
of
tarleton
movements
or
some
error
in
the
report
of
his
scouts
he
failed
of
success
in
the
object
which
he
aimed
at
this
was
the
capture
of
tarleton
while
with
his
troop
of
horse
he
was
on
his
way
to
join
the
legion
with
this
object
he
pressed
his
march
for
nelson
ferry
on
the
santee
and
placed
his
men
in
ambush
in
the
river
swamp
he
arrived
too
late
tarleton
had
already
crossed
fully
two
days
before
marion
passed
the
river
in
pursuit
advancing
with
some
earnestness
on
the
footsteps
of
his
foe
still
under
the
impression
that
tarleton
was
only
in
command
of
the
small
troop
with
which
he
had
marched
from
charleston
but
the
british
commander
had
already
effected
the
junction
with
his
legion
and
was
at
hand
in
greater
force
than
our
partisan
dreamed
of
at
night
having
reached
a
strong
position
in
the
woods
marion
was
taking
his
usual
precautions
for
making
his
camp
he
was
suddenly
struck
with
a
great
light
seemingly
at
the
plantation
of
general
richardson
this
awakened
his
anxieties
and
led
him
at
once
to
suspect
the
presence
of
his
enemy
in
that
quarter
the
progress
of
the
british
was
thus
usually
distinguished
when
they
reached
a
settlement
of
the
patriots
the
suspicions
of
marion
were
soon
confirmed
by
the
arrival
of
colonel
richardson
from
whom
he
learned
that
tarleton
was
really
at
the
plantation
the
fires
of
which
he
saw
in
force
with
his
whole
legion
and
two
the
strength
of
the
british
was
double
his
own
and
to
increase
his
anxieties
it
was
discovered
that
one
of
his
men
probably
one
of
the
late
converts
who
had
joined
the
ranks
after
the
defeat
of
tynes
had
deserted
to
the
enemy
in
command
of
a
force
so
superior
and
in
possession
of
a
guide
well
acquainted
with
the
country
tarleton
was
too
strong
to
be
withstood
the
position
of
marion
was
no
longer
safe
he
at
once
fell
back
and
crossing
in
silence
and
darkness
a
dense
and
gloomy
swamp
of
vast
extent
called
the
halted
on
jack
creek
a
distance
of
six
miles
from
his
late
encampment
this
post
was
temporarily
a
secure
one
tarleton
meanwhile
was
conducted
faithfully
by
the
deserter
into
the
but
the
bird
had
flown
he
pressed
the
pursuit
the
next
day
with
that
hot
haste
by
which
he
was
quite
as
much
distinguished
as
by
his
cruelties
but
marion
knew
his
foe
and
had
already
changed
his
ground
pushing
his
way
through
a
wild
extent
of
country
full
of
bogs
and
swamps
he
reached
benbow
ferry
about
ten
miles
above
kingstree
where
taking
a
strong
position
he
resolved
to
defend
himself
the
place
was
one
with
which
himself
and
men
were
familiar
it
was
not
only
eligible
in
itself
commanding
the
passage
of
the
river
but
it
was
one
in
which
defeat
was
not
necessarily
final
it
had
resources
and
means
of
rally
which
are
always
important
considerations
to
a
militia
command
there
were
three
difficult
passes
through
the
swamp
in
marion
rear
at
each
of
which
if
driven
by
the
enemy
his
men
could
make
a
stubborn
fight
his
position
taken
he
proceeded
promptly
to
strengthen
its
natural
defences
by
art
trees
were
felled
across
the
track
and
the
post
so
improved
as
to
reconcile
the
inequalities
of
his
own
with
the
pursuing
force
of
tarleton
had
the
latter
made
his
appearance
as
marion
fully
hoped
and
expected
the
fatal
rifles
of
the
brigade
thus
planted
would
have
very
quickly
emptied
his
best
saddles
but
the
commander
of
the
legion
grew
weary
of
the
chase
at
the
very
moment
when
it
halted
to
await
him
of
the
pursuit
he
has
given
us
a
somewhat
vainglorious
description
he
represents
himself
as
having
been
nearly
successful
by
means
of
his
great
adroitness
and
the
excellence
of
his
strategy
he
says
according
to
the
reports
of
the
country
general
marion
numbers
were
hourly
increasing
which
induced
tarleton
to
move
his
corps
for
a
short
time
in
a
very
compact
body
lest
the
americans
should
gain
any
advantage
over
patrols
or
detachments
but
as
soon
as
he
found
that
the
account
of
numbers
was
exaggerated
and
that
the
enemy
declined
an
engagement
he
divided
his
corps
into
several
small
parties
publishing
intelligence
that
each
was
on
patrol
and
that
the
main
body
of
the
king
troops
had
countermarched
to
camden
notwithstanding
the
divisions
scattered
throughout
the
country
to
impose
upon
the
enemy
tarleton
took
care
that
no
detachment
should
be
out
of
the
reach
of
assistance
and
that
the
whole
formed
after
dark
every
evening
a
solid
and
vigilant
corps
during
the
night
this
stratagem
had
not
been
employed
more
than
three
days
before
general
marion
was
on
the
point
of
falling
a
sacrifice
to
it
he
advanced
on
the
before
day
with
five
hundred
militia
to
attack
tarleton
who
had
notice
of
his
approach
and
arrived
within
two
miles
of
his
post
when
a
person
of
the
name
of
richardson
discovered
to
him
his
misconception
of
the
british
force
but
as
we
have
seen
marion
advance
upon
tarleton
was
only
the
continuation
of
the
pursuit
which
he
began
under
the
impression
that
the
latter
was
still
forcing
his
way
to
camden
with
the
small
force
with
which
he
had
crossed
the
santee
of
the
descent
of
the
legion
from
above
he
knew
nothing
and
the
three
days
strategy
of
tarleton
were
wasted
upon
him
the
caution
of
the
british
colonel
in
all
this
time
might
have
been
spared
it
influenced
the
course
of
marion
in
no
respect
we
have
seen
that
when
the
latter
discovered
his
enemy
it
was
before
day
had
closed
and
not
just
before
day
we
have
also
seen
that
tarleton
own
bonfires
had
already
revealed
the
secret
of
his
presence
in
strength
to
his
wary
antagonist
if
richardson
had
never
entered
the
camp
of
marion
the
blazing
dwellings
of
the
richardson
family
would
have
led
to
such
precautions
on
the
side
of
the
partisan
as
must
have
effectually
baffled
the
objects
of
the
british
colonel
this
indulgence
in
the
usual
british
passion
for
burning
the
homesteads
of
women
and
children
which
tarleton
could
not
resist
even
though
his
immediate
aim
required
the
utmost
watchfulness
and
secrecy
at
once
revealed
to
marion
not
only
that
his
enemy
was
there
but
that
he
was
there
with
a
force
in
the
strength
of
which
he
had
the
utmost
confidence
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
a
small
detachment
a
scouting
party
of
horse
a
troop
sent
out
for
intelligence
such
as
the
british
colonel
represents
his
several
parties
to
have
been
when
his
force
was
broken
up
in
detail
to
beguile
the
partisan
would
be
likely
to
commit
such
excesses
as
to
draw
the
eye
of
the
country
suddenly
upon
them
at
a
time
too
when
a
wary
adversary
was
within
two
miles
with
a
force
of
five
hundred
men
tarleton
proceeds
a
pursuit
was
immediately
commenced
and
continued
for
seven
hours
through
swamps
and
defiles
some
prisoners
fell
into
the
possession
of
the
legion
dragoons
who
gained
ground
very
fast
and
must
soon
have
brought
the
enemy
to
action
when
an
express
from
earl
cornwallis
who
had
followed
the
tracks
of
the
march
recalled
tarleton
such
is
the
british
narrative
we
have
reason
to
think
it
faulty
in
several
respects
we
doubt
that
it
was
the
express
of
earl
cornwallis
that
arrested
the
pursuit
of
our
legionary
colonel
we
are
disposed
to
ascribe
it
to
his
own
weariness
of
the
game
the
dispatch
of
cornwallis
to
which
he
refers
was
dated
at
winnsboro
on
the
of
the
month
it
was
on
the
night
of
the
as
we
see
by
tarleton
own
statement
that
he
commenced
the
close
and
earnest
pursuit
of
marion
the
distance
from
winnsboro
to
the
even
allowing
that
the
instincts
and
information
of
the
express
should
bring
him
directly
upon
the
trail
of
the
legion
would
have
employed
him
fully
two
days
to
overcome
these
two
days
would
have
brought
him
to
the
close
of
the
twelfth
up
to
which
period
had
tarleton
continued
the
chase
he
might
have
enjoyed
the
satisfaction
of
shaking
hands
with
his
antagonist
in
his
defences
at
benbow
ferry
there
at
the
first
proper
position
in
which
he
might
with
any
hopes
of
success
oppose
his
adversary
had
marion
taken
his
stand
there
having
entrenched
himself
he
was
busy
in
bringing
together
his
forces
had
tarleton
says
judge
james
proceeded
with
his
jaded
horses
to
benbow
he
would
have
exposed
his
force
to
such
sharp
shooting
as
he
had
not
yet
experienced
and
that
in
a
place
where
he
could
not
have
acted
with
either
his
artillery
or
cavalry
but
tarleton
had
tired
of
the
adventure
after
a
pursuit
of
miles
he
found
his
progress
arrested
by
a
swamp
wide
and
deep
through
which
his
eye
could
discern
no
beaten
road
but
this
should
have
discouraged
no
resolute
commander
having
his
enemy
before
him
marion
had
already
preceded
him
in
the
passage
and
was
then
within
ten
miles
awaiting
his
approach
he
could
have
reached
him
in
three
hours
and
four
might
have
sufficed
for
the
march
and
conflict
the
express
of
cornwallis
might
have
yielded
that
time
since
it
was
not
on
the
necessity
of
the
earl
that
he
had
written
tarleton
insinuates
that
the
sole
desire
of
marion
was
to
save
himself
now
one
fact
will
suffice
to
show
the
incorrectness
of
this
notion
for
a
distance
of
twelve
miles
on
his
retreat
the
course
of
the
partisan
skirted
the
south
branch
of
black
river
he
could
at
any
time
and
in
a
few
minutes
have
plunged
into
it
and
no
regular
body
of
cavalry
could
have
followed
him
besides
so
close
we
are
told
was
the
pursuit
that
the
dragoons
were
taking
prisoners
the
enemy
must
have
been
overtaken
but
for
the
express
under
such
circumstances
it
seems
strange
that
tarleton
should
show
such
singular
deference
to
the
express
as
to
forbear
the
blow
when
his
sabre
was
already
uplifted
and
one
of
his
most
troublesome
enemies
was
actually
beneath
it
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
with
his
dragoons
so
close
on
the
heels
of
the
fugitives
and
informed
by
prisoners
of
the
proximity
of
his
foe
he
should
not
have
heard
that
he
was
finally
posted
and
in
waiting
for
him
we
will
suppose
however
that
he
did
not
he
turned
the
head
of
his
column
at
the
very
moment
when
his
object
was
attainable
popular
tradition
represents
him
as
expressing
himself
discouraged
at
the
sight
of
ox
swamp
and
exclaiming
come
my
boys
let
us
go
back
we
will
soon
find
the
cock
meaning
sumter
but
as
for
this
d
d
fox
the
devil
himself
could
not
catch
him
from
this
speech
of
tarleton
we
are
given
to
understand
that
the
two
popular
names
were
derived
by
which
sumter
and
marion
were
ever
after
known
by
their
followers
tarleton
gained
nothing
by
the
pursuit
of
his
wily
antagonist
marion
remained
in
perfect
mastery
over
the
whole
territory
which
he
had
been
wont
to
overrun
with
a
strength
somewhat
increased
by
the
fact
that
he
had
succeeded
in
baffling
and
eluding
the
attempts
of
one
who
had
hitherto
been
successful
in
all
his
enterprises
from
this
moment
the
career
of
tarleton
ceased
to
be
fortunate
his
failure
to
capture
marion
was
the
first
in
a
long
train
of
disappointments
and
disasters

of

retreat
and
unwilling
to
press
upon
him
in
his
stronghold
tarleton
turned
the
heads
of
his
columns
in
the
search
after
the
other
famous
partisan
of
carolina
general
sumter
this
gentleman
after
the
surprise
and
dispersion
of
his
force
which
had
followed
so
closely
the
defeat
of
gates
had
fallen
back
with
the
wreck
of
his
command
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
mountains
but
no
sooner
was
it
understood
that
a
second
continental
army
was
on
its
march
for
carolina
than
he
emerged
from
his
retreat
and
renewed
his
enterprises
with
as
much
activity
as
ever
it
was
to
direct
his
arms
against
this
enemy
and
to
restrain
his
incursions
that
tarleton
was
recalled
from
the
pursuit
of
marion
by
earl
cornwallis
the
force
under
sumter
had
increased
to
about
five
hundred
men
when
he
approached
and
took
post
within
miles
of
the
encampment
of
cornwallis
at
winnsboro
this
approach
particularly
as
sumter
unlike
marion
was
apt
to
linger
some
time
in
a
favorite
position
induced
the
british
commander
to
attempt
his
surprise
wemyss
was
accordingly
sent
against
him
with
a
strong
body
of
british
infantry
but
wemyss
was
defeated
severely
wounded
himself
and
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
americans
the
failure
of
wemyss
and
the
audacity
of
sumter
provoked
the
anxiety
and
indignation
of
cornwallis
tarleton
promptly
seconded
the
wishes
of
his
superior
and
rapidly
advanced
upon
his
adversary
sumter
hearing
of
his
approach
and
with
a
force
very
far
superior
to
his
own
commenced
his
retreat
and
threw
the
tyger
river
between
himself
and
his
pursuer
apprehensive
only
of
losing
his
prey
and
not
at
all
doubtful
of
his
victory
tarleton
continued
the
pursuit
with
about
four
hundred
mounted
men
leaving
the
main
body
of
his
infantry
and
artillery
to
follow
as
soon
as
sumter
discovered
that
the
whole
of
the
british
army
was
not
at
his
heels
he
discontinued
his
flight
and
waited
for
his
enemy
at
the
house
and
farm
of
one
blackstock
on
the
banks
of
the
tyger
here
an
action
followed
in
which
the
british
were
defeated
tarleton
lost
slain
and
one
hundred
wounded
the
americans
lost
three
men
slain
and
as
many
wounded
but
among
the
latter
was
their
commander
the
wound
of
sumter
was
in
the
breast
and
a
very
severe
one
he
was
wrapped
up
in
the
raw
hide
of
a
bullock
suspended
between
two
horses
and
guarded
by
a
hundred
faithful
followers
was
conveyed
in
safety
to
north
carolina
where
unhappily
he
lay
for
some
time
totally
incapacitated
from
active
performance
judge
james
says
a
guard
of
five
men
a
this
event
was
preceded
and
followed
by
others
quite
as
encouraging
to
the
american
cause
the
battle
of
king
mountain
took
place
on
the
october
in
which
the
british
under
major
ferguson
experienced
a
total
defeat
ferguson
being
slain
and
the
killed
wounded
and
captured
of
his
army
amounting
to
eleven
hundred
men
meanwhile
the
example
of
marion
and
sumter
had
aroused
the
partisan
spirit
in
numerous
other
places
and
every
distinct
section
of
the
country
soon
produced
its
particular
leader
under
whom
the
whigs
embodied
themselves
striking
wherever
an
opportunity
offered
of
cutting
off
the
british
and
tories
in
detail
and
retiring
to
places
of
safety
or
dispersing
in
groups
on
the
approach
of
a
superior
force
this
species
of
warfare
was
of
all
kinds
that
which
was
most
likely
to
try
the
patience
and
baffle
the
progress
of
the
british
commander
he
could
overrun
the
country
but
he
made
no
conquests
his
great
armies
passed
over
the
land
unquestioned
but
had
no
sooner
withdrawn
than
his
posts
were
assailed
his
detachments
cut
off
his
supplies
arrested
and
the
tories
once
more
overawed
by
their
fierce
and
fearless
neighbors

at

expected
moment
was
always
ready
to
prevent
the
gathering
into
force
and
strength
of
the
loyalists
and
this
activity
was
shown
and
this
warfare
waged
at
a
time
when
not
only
was
the
state
without
an
army
without
any
distinct
embodiment
of
its
own
or
of
its
confederates
but
when
it
was
covered
everywhere
with
strong
and
well
appointed
posts
of
the
enemy
the
position
of
earl
cornwallis
at
winnsboro
completed
his
chain
of
posts
from
georgetown
to
augusta
in
a
circle
the
centre
of
which
would
have
been
about
beaufort
in
south
carolina
equidistant
from
charleston
and
savannah
these
posts
consisted
of
georgetown
camden
winnsboro
and
augusta
within
this
circle
was
an
interior
chain
at
the
distance
of
half
the
radius
consisting
of

watson
on
the
road
to
camden
motte
house
and
granby
on
the
congaree
dorchester
and
orangeburgh
on
the
road
both
to
and
granby
were
fortified
as
posts
of
rest
and

on
the
line
of
communication
as
was
monk
corner
or
biggin
church
and
some
other
small
posts
on

these
posts
were
all
judiciously
chosen

detachments
under
the
very
jaws
of

our
partisans
succeeded
in
embodying
public
opinion
through
the
very
sense
of
shame
against
their
enemies
the
courage
of
the
whigs
was
ennobled
and
their
timidity
rebuked
when
they
beheld
such
a
daring
spirit
and
one
so
crowned
by
frequent
successes
in
such
petty
numbers
the
de
corps
which
these
successes
and
this
spirit
awakened
in
the
brigade
of
marion
necessarily
imparted
itself
to
the
region
of
country
in
which
he
operated
and
the
admiration
which
he
inspired
in
the
friendly
and
the
fear
which
he
taught
to
the
adverse
uniting
in
their
effects
brought
equally
the
faithful
and
the
doubtful
to
his
ranks
from
the
moment
that
he
eluded
the
arts
and
baffled
the
pursuit
of
tarleton

people
of

tract
of

stretching
from

to

mouth

either
ready
or
preparing
to
join

under
these
auspices
with
his
brigade
increasing
marion
began
to
prepare
for
new
enterprises
the
british
post
at
georgetown
was
one
of
considerable
strength
and
importance
it
was
of
special
importance
to
marion
from
this
place
he
procured
or
expected
to
procure
his
supplies
of
salt
clothing
and
ammunition
of
these
commodities
he
was
now
grievously
in
want
to
surprise
georgetown
became
as
desirable
as
it
was
difficult
marion
determined
to
attempt
it
it
was
only
by
a
surprise
that
he
could
hope
to
be
successful
and
he
made
his
plans
accordingly
they
were
unfortunate
and
the
event
was
particularly
and
personally
distressing
to
himself
to
expedite
his
schemes
he
crossed
black
river
at
a
retired
place
called
potato
ferry
and
proceeded
by
the
towards
the
object
of
his
aim
three
miles
from
the
town
there
is
an
inland
swamp
called
white
bay
which
discharging
itself
by
two
mouths
the
one
into
black
river
the
other
into
sampit
completely
insulates
the
town
which
stands
on
the
north
side
of
the
latter
river
near
its
junction
with
winyaw
bay
over
the
creek
which
empties
into
the
sampit
there
is
a
bridge
two
miles
from
georgetown
in
the
rear
of
these
swamps
marion
concealed
himself
with
the
main
body
of
his
force
sending
out
two
parties
to
reconnoitre
one
of
these
parties
was
commanded
by
horry
the
other
by
capt
melton
these
officers
both
encountered
the
enemy
but
they
were
not
both
equally
fortunate
in
the
result
horry
may
be
allowed
to
tell
his
own
story
i
was
sent
he
writes
by
marion
to
reconnoitre
georgetown
i
proceeded
with
a
guide
through
the
woods
all
night
at
the
dawn
of
day
i
drew
near
the
town
i
laid
an
ambuscade
with
thirty
men
and
three
officers
near
the
road
about
sunrise
a
chair
appeared
with
two
ladies
escorted
by
two
british
officers
i
was
ready
in
advance
with
an
officer
to
cut
them
off
but
reflecting
that
they
might
escape
and
alarm
the
town
which
would
prevent
my
taking
greater
numbers
i
desisted
the
officers
and
chair
halted
very
near
me
but
soon
the
chair
went
on
and
the
officers
gallopped
in
retrograde
into
the
town
our
party
continued
in
ambush
until
nothing
appearing
and
men
and
horses
having
eaten
nothing
for
hours
we
were
hungered
and
retired
to
a
plantation
of
my
a
white
not
far
distant
there
a
curious
scene
took
place
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
house
four
ladies
appeared
two
of
whom
were
white
and
her
daughter
i
was
asked
what
i
wanted
i
answered
food
refreshment
the
other
two
ladies
were
those
whom
i
had
seen
escorted
by
the
british
officers
they
seemed
greatly
agitated
and
begged
most
earnestly
that
i
would
go
away
for
the
family
was
very
poor
had
no
provisions
of
any
sort
that
i
knew
that
they
were
whigs
and
surely
would
not
add
to
their
distress
so
pressing
were
they
for
my
immediately
leaving
the
plantation
that
i
thought
they
had
more
in
view
than
they
pretended
i
kept
my
eye
on
white
and
saw
she
had
a
smiling
countenance
but
said
nothing
soon
she
left
the
room
and
i
left
it
also
and
went
into
the
piazza
laid
my
cap
sword
and
pistols
on
the
long
bench
and
walked
the
piazza
when
i
discovered
white
behind
the
house
chimney
beckoning
me
i
got
to
her
undiscovered
by
the
young
ladies
when
she
said
horry
be
on
your
guard
these
two
young
ladies
miss
f
and
m
are
just
from
georgetown
they
are
much
frightened
and
i
believe
the
british
are
leaving
it
and
may
soon
attack
you
as
to
provisions
which
they
make
such
a
rout
about
i
have
plenty
for
your
men
and
horses
in
yonder
barn
but
you
must
affect
to
take
them
by
force
hams
bacon
rice
and
fodder
are
there
you
must
insist
on
the
key
of
the
barn
and
threaten
to
split
the
door
with
an
axe
if
not
immediately
opened
i
begged
her
to
say
no
more
for
i
was
well
acquainted
with
all
such
matters
to
leave
the
ladies
and
everything
else
to
my
management
she
said
but
do
not
ruin
us
be
artful
and
cunning
or
white
may
be
hanged
and
all
our
houses
burnt
over
our
heads
we
both
secretly
returned
she
to
the
room
where
the
young
ladies
were
and
i
to
the
piazza
i
had
just
left
this
little
narrative
will
give
some
idea
of
the
straits
to
which
the
good
whig
matrons
of
carolina
were
sometimes
reduced
in
those
days
but
no
time
was
allowed
horry
to
extort
the
provisions
as
suggested
he
had
scarcely
got
to
the
piazza
when
his
videttes
gave
the
alarm
two
shots
warned
him
of
the
approach
of
the
foe
and
forgetting
that
his
cap
sabre
and
pistols
lay
on
the
long
bench
on
the
piazza
horry
mounted
his
horse
left
the
enclosure
and
rushed
into
the
melee
the
british
were
seventeen
in
number
well
mounted
and
commanded
by
a
brave
fellow
named
merritt
the
dragoons
taken
by
surprise
turned
in
flight
and
smiting
at
every
step
the
partisans
pursued
them
with
fatal
earnestness
but
two
men
are
reported
to
have
escaped
death
or
captivity
and
they
were
their
captain
and
a
sergeant
it
was
in
approaching
to
encounter
merritt
that
horry
discovered
that
he
was
weaponless
my
officers
says
he
in
succession
came
up
with
captain
merritt
who
was
in
the
rear
of
his
party
urging
them
forward
they
engaged
him
he
was
a
brave
fellow
baxter
with
pistols
fired
at
his
breast
and
missing
him
retired
postelle
and
greene
with
swords
engaged
him
both
were
beaten
off
greene
nearly
lost
his
head
his
buckskin
breeches
were
cut
through
several
inches
i
almost
blush
to
say
that
this
one
british
officer
beat
off
three
americans
the
honor
of
the
day
was
decidedly
with
merritt
though
he
was
beaten
he
was
no
doubt
a
far
better
swordsman
than
our
cavalry
with
broadswords
wrought
out
of
mill
saws
merritt
abandoned
his
horse
and
escaped
to
a
neighboring
swamp
from
whence
at
midnight
he
got
into
georgetown
two
of
horry
prisoners
proved
to
be
american
soldiers
the
sergeant
belonged
to
the
regiment
of
south
carolina
continentals
and
a
drummer
formerly
belonged
to
my
own
regiment
the
the
drummer
was
cruelly
wounded
on
the
head
the
sergeant
was
of
virginia
and
wounded
on
the
arm
they
said
they
had
enlisted
from
the
prison
ship
to
have
a
chance
of
escaping
and
joining
their
countrymen
in
arms
and
would
have
done
so
that
day
but
that
the
british
captain
was
in
the
rear
and
they
dared
not
horry
rejoined
marion
in
safety
with
his
prisoners
life
of
horry
by
himself
pp
of
horry
weems
speaking
for
horry
tells
us
that
he
met
with
captain
merritt
after
the
war
in
new
york
who
recognized
him
and
told
him
that
he
had
never
had
such
a
fright
in
all
his
life
as
upon
that
occasion
will
you
believe
me
sir
said
he
when
i
assure
you
that
i
went
out
that
morning
with
my
locks
of
as
bright
an
auburn
as
ever
curled
upon
the
forehead
of
youth
and
by
the
time
i
had
crawled
out
of
the
swamp
into
georgetown
that
night
they
were
as
grey
as
a
badger
of
captain
melton
was
not
so
fortunate
he
came
in
contact
with
a
party
of
tories
much
larger
than
his
own
force
who
were
patrolling
under
captain
barfield
near
white
bridge
a
sharp
but
short
action
followed
in
which
melton
was
compelled
to
retreat
but
gabriel
marion
a
nephew
of
the
general
had
his
horse
shot
under
him
and
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
tories
as
soon
as
he
was
recognized
he
was
put
to
death
no
respite
allowed
no
pause
no
prayer
his
name
was
fatal
to
him
the
loss
was
severely
felt
by
his
uncle
who
with
no
family
or
children
of
his
own
had
lavished
the
greater
part
of
his
affections
upon
this
youth
of
whom
high
expectations
had
been
formed
and
who
had
already
frequently
distinguished
himself
by
his
gallantry
and
conduct
he
had
held
a
lieutenancy
in
the
second
south
carolina
regiment
and
was
present
at
the
battle
of
fort
moultrie
subsequently
he
had
taken
part
in
most
of
the
adventures
of
his
uncle
marion
felt
his
privation
keenly
but
he
consoled
himself
by
saying
that
he
should
not
mourn
for
him
the
youth
was
virtuous
and
had
fallen
in
the
cause
of
his
country
but
this
event
with
some
other
instances
of
brutality
and
murder
on
the
part
of
the
tories
happening
about
this
time
gave
a
more
savage
character
than
ever
to
the
warfare
which
ensued
motives
of
private
anger
and
personal
revenge
embittered
and
increased
the
usual
ferocities
of
civil
war
and
hundreds
of
dreadful
and
desperate
tragedies
gave
that
peculiar
aspect
to
the
struggle
which
led
greene
to
say
that
the
inhabitants
pursued
each
other
rather
like
wild
beasts
than
like
men
in
the
cheraw
district
on
the
pedee
above
the
line
where
marion
commanded
the
whig
and
tory
warfare
of
which
we
know
but
little
beyond
this
fact
was
one
of
utter
extermination
the
revolutionary
struggle
in
carolina
was
of
a
sort
utterly
unknown
in
any
other
part
of
the
union
judge
james
writes
gabriel
marion
was
taken
prisoner
but
as
soon
as
his
name
was
announced
he
was
inhumanely
shot
the
instrument
of
death
was
planted
so
near
that
it
burnt
his
linen
at
the
a
the
attempt
upon
georgetown
was
thus
defeated
the
british
had
taken
the
alarm
and
were
now
in
strength
and
in
a
state
of
vigilance
and
activity
which
precluded
the
possibility
of
surprise
marion
wishes
therefore
with
regard
to
this
place
were
deferred
accordingly
to
a
more
auspicious
season
he

marion
made
his
fortress
having
secured
all
the
boats
of
the
neighborhood
he
chose
such
as
he
needed
and
destroyed
the
rest
where
the
natural
defences
of
the
island
seemed
to
require
aid
from
art
he
bestowed
it
and
by
cutting
away
bridges
and
obstructing
the
ordinary
pathways
with
timber
he
contrived
to
insulate
as
much
as
possible
the
country
under
his
command
from
this
fortress
his
scouting
parties
were
sent
forth
nightly
in
all
directions
enemies
were
always
easy
to
be
found
the

maintained
minor
posts
at
nelson

as
well
as
georgetown
and
the

more
numerous

skilfully
conducted
than
the

of

marion
encampment
implied
no
repose
no
forbearance
of
the
active
business
of
war
very
far
from
it
he
was
never
more
dangerous
to
an
enemy
than
when
he
seemed
quietly
in
camp
his
camp
indeed
was
frequently
a
lure
by
which
to
tempt
the
tories
into
unseasonable
exposure
the
post
at
snow
island
gave
him
particular
facilities
for
this
species
of
warfare
he
had
but
to
cross
a
river
and
a
three
march
enabled
him
to
forage
in
an
enemy
country
reinforcements
came
to
him
daily
and
it
was
only
now
for
the
first
time
that
his
command
began
to
assume
the
appearance
and
exhibit
the
force
of
a
brigade
he
became
somewhat
bolder
in
consequence
in
the
tone
which
he
used
towards
the
tories
we
find
him
at
this
period
sending
forth
his
officers
with
orders
of
a
peremptory
nature

december
correspondence
of
marion
quoted
by
he
then
laid
the
country
under
martial
law
the
proper
measure
for
straitening
an
enemy
and
compelling
sluggish
and
doubtful
friends
to
declare
themselves
in
this
proceeding
he
was
justified
by
the
authority
of
governor
rutledge
from
whom
with
a
brigadier
commission
he
had
received
military
command
over
a
region
of
country
of
vast
extent
which
the
indefatigable
partisan
contrived
to
compass
and
coerce
if
not
altogether
to
command
and
control
similar
orders
with
those
which
were
given
to
postelle
were
addressed
to
horry
and
they
were
both
dispatched
the
one
as
we
have
seen
between
black
and
pedee
rivers
the
other
to
waccamaw
creek
other
parties
were
sent
out
in
other
quarters
with
like
objects
and
with
the
whole
contiguous
country
thus
placed
under
the
keenest
surveillance
marion
hailed
the
close
of
the
year
in
his
swamp
fortress
all
these
parties
were
more
or
less
engaged
with
the
enemy
at
different
periods
while
on
their
scouting
expeditions
several
small
but
spirited
achievements
of
which
history
condescends
to
furnish
no
details
occurred
among
them
in
which
however
the
partisans
were
not
always
successful
one
instance
may
be
mentioned
lieutenant
roger
gordon
had
been
dispatched
with
a
small
party
to
patrol
on
lynch
creek
he
suffered
himself
while
taking
refreshments
at
a
house
to
be
surrounded
by
a
party
of
tories
under
capt
butler
the
enemy
made
good
his
approaches
to
the
house
and
set
it
on
fire
finding
himself
greatly
outnumbered
and
perceiving
that
resistance
would
be
useless
gordon
surrendered
upon
terms
but
as
soon
as
his
party
had
yielded
up
their
arms
they
were
murdered
to
a
man
these
bloody
events
were
accompanied
and
followed
by
others
of
a
like
character
nor
were
the
tories
always
or
exclusively
guilty
the
sanguinary
warfare
began
with
them
but
it
was
perpetuated
by
mutual
excesses
shortly
after
the
murder
of
gabriel
marion
the
person
who
was
supposed
to
have
been
guilty
of
the
savage
crime
was
taken
prisoner
by
horry
while
on
the
road
returning
to
the
camp
environed
by
his
guards
the
prisoner
was
shot
down
by
an
officer
who
escaped
detection
under
cover
of
the
night
prisoners
after
this
were
seldom
made
on
either
side
where
the
whigs
and
tories
came
in
conflict
no
quarter
was
given
safety
lay
in
victory
alone
and
the
vanquished
if
they
could
not
find
refuge
in
the
swamps
found
no
mercy
from
the
conqueror
even
where
under
the
occasional
influence
of
a
milder
mood
or
milder
captain
the
discomfited
were
admitted
to
present
mercy
there
was
still
no
security
for
their
lives
there
were
a
few
infuriated
men
who
defied
subordination
by
whom
on
both
sides
the
unhappy
captives
were
sure
to
be
sacrificed
we
need
not
say
in
behalf
of
marion
and
his
superior
officers
that
where
he
or
they
commanded
in
person
no
countenance
was
given
to
these
bloody
principles
and
performances
marion
was
notoriously
the
most
merciful
of
enemies
the
death
of
the
prisoner
in
the
ranks
of
horry
though
the
unhappy
man
was
charged
with
the
murder
of
his
favorite
nephew
was
a
subject
of
the
greatest
soreness
and
annoyance
to
his
mind
and
he
warmly
expressed
the
indignation
which
he
felt
at
an
action
which
he
could
not
punish

career
as
a
partisan
in
the
thickets
and
swamps
of
carolina
is
abundantly
distinguished
by
the
picturesque
but
it
was
while
he
held
his
camp
at
snow
island
that
it
received
its
highest
colors
of
romance
in
this
snug
and
impenetrable
fortress
he
reminds
us
very
much
of
the
ancient
feudal
baron
of
france
and
germany
who
perched
on
castled
eminence
looked
down
with
the
complacency
of
an
eagle
from
his
eyrie
and
marked
all
below
him
for
his
own
the
resemblance
is
good
in
all
respects
but
one
the
plea
and
justification
of
marion
are
complete
his
warfare
was
legitimate
he
was
no
mountain
robber
no
selfish
and
reckless
ruler
thirsting
for
spoil
and
delighting
inhumanly
in
blood
the
love
of
liberty
the
defence
of
country
the
protection
of
the
feeble
the
maintenance
of
humanity
and
all
its
dearest
interests
against
its
tyrant
these
were
the
noble
incentives
which
strengthened
him
in
his
stronghold
made
it
terrible
in
the
eyes
of
his
enemy
and
sacred
in
those
of
his
countrymen
here
he
lay
grimly
watching
for
the
proper
time
and
opportunity
when
to
sally
forth
and
strike
his
position
so
far
as
it
sheltered
him
from
his
enemies
and
gave
him
facilities
for
their
overthrow
was
wonderfully
like
that
of
the
knightly
robber
of
the
middle
ages
true
his
camp
was
without
its
castle
but
it
had
its
fosse
and
keep
its
and
portcullis
there
were
no
towers
frowning
in
stone
and
iron
but
there
were
tall
pillars
of
pine
and
cypress
from
the
waving
tops
of
which
the
warders
looked
out
and
gave
warning
of
the
foe
or
the
victim
no
cannon
thundered
from
his
walls
no
knights
shining
in
armor
sallied
forth
to
the
tourney
he
was
fond
of
none
of
the
mere
pomps
of
war
he
held
no
revels
drank
no
wine
through
the
helmet
barred
and
quite
unlike
the
baronial
ruffian
of
the
middle
ages
was
strangely
indifferent
to
the
feasts
of
gluttony
and
swilled
insolence
he
found
no
joy
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
art
had
done
little
to
increase
the
comforts
or
the
securities
of
his
fortress
it
was
one
complete
to
his
hands
from
those
of
nature
such
a
one
as
must
have
delighted
the
generous
english
outlaw
of
sherwood
forest
isolated
by
deep
ravines
and
rivers
a
dense
forest
of
mighty
trees
and
interminable
undergrowth
the
vine
and
briar
guarded
his
passes
the
laurel
and
the
shrub
the
vine
and
sweet
scented
jessamine
roofed
his
dwelling
and
clambered
up
between
his
closed
eyelids
and
the
stars
obstructions
scarcely
penetrable
by
any
foe
crowded
the
pathways
to
his
tent
and
no
footstep
not
practised
in
the
secret
and
the
manner
born
might
pass
unchallenged
to
his
midnight
rest
the
swamp
was
his
moat
his
bulwarks
were
the
deep
ravines
which
watched
by
sleepless
rifles
were
quite
as
impregnable
as
the
castles
on
the
rhine
here
in
the
possession
of
his
fortress
the
partisan
slept
secure
in
the
defence
of
such
a
place
in
the
employment
of
such
material
as
he
had
to
use
marion
stands
out
alone
in
our
written
history
as
the
great
master
of
that
sort
of
strategy
which
renders
the
untaught
in
his
native
thickets
a
match
for
the
best
drilled
veteran
of
europe
marion
seemed
to
possess
an
intuitive
knowledge
of
his
men
and
material
by
which
without
effort
he
was
led
to
the
most
judicious
modes
for
their
exercise
he
beheld
at
a
glance
the
evils
or
advantages
of
a
position
by
a
nice
adaptation
of
his
resources
to
his
situation
he
promptly
supplied
its
deficiencies
and
repaired
its
defects
till
this
was
done
he
did
not
sleep
he
relaxed
in
none
of
his
endeavors
by
patient
toil
by
keenest
vigilance
by
a
genius
peculiarly
his
own
he
reconciled
those
inequalities
of
fortune
or
circumstance
under
which
ordinary
men
sit
down
in
despair
surrounded
by
superior
foes
he
showed
no
solicitude
on
this
account
if
his
position
was
good
their
superiority
gave
him
little
concern
he
soon
contrived
to
lessen
it
by
cutting
off
their
advanced
parties
their
scouts
or
foragers
and
striking
at
their
detachments
in
detail
it
was
on
their
own
ground
in
their
immediate
presence
nay
in
the
very
midst
of
them
that
he
frequently
made
himself
a
home
better
live
upon
foes
than
upon
friends
was
his
maxim
and
this
practice
of
living
amongst
foes
was
the
great
school
by
which
his
people
were
taught
vigilance
the
adroitness
and
address
of
marion
captainship
were
never
more
fully
displayed
than
when
he
kept
snow
island
sallying
forth
as
occasion
offered
to
harass
the
superior
foe
to
cut
off
his
convoys
or
to
break
up
before
they
could
well
embody
the
gathering
and
undisciplined
tories
his
movements
were
marked
by
equal
promptitude
and
wariness
he
suffered
no
risks
from
a
neglect
of
proper
precaution
his
habits
of
circumspection
and
resolve
ran
together
in
happy
unison
his
plans
carefully
considered
beforehand
were
always
timed
with
the
happiest
reference
to
the
condition
and
feelings
of
his
men
to
prepare
that
condition
and
to
train
those
feelings
were
the
chief
employment
of
his
repose
he
knew
his
game
and
how
it
should
be
played
before
a
step
was
taken
or
a
weapon
drawn
when
he
himself
or
any
of
his
parties
left
the
island
upon
an
expedition
they
advanced
along
no
beaten
paths
they
made
them
as
they
went
he
had
the
indian
faculty
in
perfection
of
gathering
his
course
from
the
sun
from
the
stars
from
the
bark
and
the
tops
of
trees
and
such
other
natural
guides
as
the
woodman
acquires
only
through
long
and
watchful
experience
many
of
the
trails
thus
opened
by
him
upon
these
expeditions
are
now
the
ordinary
avenues
of
the
country
on
starting
he
almost
invariably
struck
into
the
woods
and
seeking
the
heads
of
the
larger
water
courses
crossed
them
at
their
first
and
small
beginnings
he
destroyed
the
bridges
where
he
could
he
preferred
fords
the
former
not
only
facilitated
the
progress
of
less
fearless
enemies
but
apprised
them
of
his
own
approach
if
speed
was
essential
a
more
direct
but
not
less
cautious
route
was
pursued
the
stream
was
crossed
sometimes
where
it
was
deepest
on
such
occasions
the
party
swam
their
horses
marion
himself
leading
the
way
though
he
himself
was
unable
to
swim
he
rode
a
famous
horse
called
ball
which
he
had
taken
from
a
loyalist
captain
of
that
name
this
animal
was
a
sorrel
of
high
generous
blood
and
took
the
water
as
if
born
to
it
the
horses
of
the
brigade
soon
learned
to
follow
him
as
naturally
as
their
riders
followed
his
master
there
was
no
waiting
for
pontoons
and
boats
had
there
been
there
would
have
been
no
surprises
the
secrecy
with
which
marion
conducted
his
expeditions
was
perhaps
one
of
the
reasons
for
their
frequent
success
he
entrusted
his
schemes
to
nobody
not
even
his
most
confidential
officers
he
consulted
with
them
respectfully
heard
them
patiently
weighed
their
suggestions
and
silently
approached
his
conclusions
they
knew
his
determinations
only
from
his
actions
he
left
no
track
behind
him
if
it
were
possible
to
avoid
it
he
was
often
vainly
hunted
after
by
his
own
detachments
he
was
more
apt
at
finding
them
than
they
him
his
scouts
were
taught
a
peculiar
and
shrill
whistle
which
at
night
could
be
heard
at
a
most
astonishing
distance
we
are
reminded
of
the
signal
of
roderick
dhu
he
whistled
shrill
and
he
was
answered
from
the
hill
wild
as
the
scream
of
the
curlew
from
crag
to
crag
the
signal
flew
his
expeditions
were
frequently
long
and
his
men
hurrying
forth
without
due
preparation
not
unfrequently
suffered
much
privation
from
want
of
food
to
guard
against
this
danger
it
was
their
habit
to
watch
his
cook
if
they
saw
him
unusually
busied
in
preparing
supplies
of
the
rude
portable
food
which
it
was
marion
custom
to
carry
on
such
occasions
they
knew
what
was
before
them
and
provided
themselves
accordingly
in
no
other
way
could
they
arrive
at
their
intentions
his
favorite
time
for
moving
was
with
the
setting
sun
and
then
it
was
known
that
the
march
would
continue
all
night
before
striking
any
sudden
blow
he
has
been
known
to
march
sixty
or
seventy
miles
taking
no
other
food
in
hours
than
a
meal
of
cold
potatoes
and
a
draught
of
cold
water
the
latter
might
have
been
repeated
this
was
truly
a
spartan
process
for
acquiring
vigor
its
results
were
a
degree
of
patient
hardihood
as
well
in
officers
as
men
to
which
few
soldiers
in
any
periods
have
attained
these
marches
were
made
in
all
seasons
his
men
were
badly
clothed
in
homespun
a
light
wear
which
afforded
little
warmth
they
slept
in
the
open
air
and
frequently
without
a
blanket
their
ordinary
food
consisted
of
sweet
potatoes
garnished
on
fortunate
occasions
with
lean
beef
salt
was
only
to
be
had
when
they
succeeded
in
the
capture
of
an
commissariat
and
even
when
this
most
necessary
of
all
human
condiments
was
obtained
the
unselfish
nature
of
marion
made
him
indifferent
to
its
use
he
distributed
it
on
such
occasions
in
quantities
not
exceeding
a
bushel
to
each
whig
family
and
by
this
patriarchal
care
still
farther
endeared
himself
to
the
affection
of
his
followers
the
effect
of
this
mode
of
progress
was
soon
felt
by
the
people
of
the
partisan
they
quickly
sought
to
emulate
the
virtues
which
they
admired
they
became
expert
in
the
arts
which
he
practised
so
successfully
the
constant
employment
which
he
gave
them
the
nature
of
his
exactions
taught
activity
vigilance
coolness
and
audacity
his
first
requisition
from
his
subordinates
was
good
information
his
scouts
were
always
his
best
men
they
were
generally
good
horsemen
and
first
rate
shots
his
cavalry
were
in
fact
so
many
mounted
gunmen
not
uniformly
weaponed
but
carrying
the
rifle
the
carbine
or
an
ordinary
as
they
happened
to
possess
or
procure
them
their
swords
unless
taken
from
the
enemy
were
made
out
of
mill
saws
roughly
manufactured
by
a
forest
blacksmith
his
scouts
were
out
in
all
directions
and
at
all
hours
they
did
the
double
duty
of
patrol
and
spies
they
hovered
about
the
posts
of
the
enemy
crouching
in
the
thicket
or
darting
along
the
plain
picking
up
prisoners
and
information
and
spoils
together
they
cut
off
stragglers
encountered
patrols
of
the
foe
and
arrested
his
supplies
on
the
way
to
the
garrison
sometimes
the
single
scout
buried
in
the
thick
tops
of
the
tree
looked
down
upon
the
march
of
his
legions
or
hung
perched
over
the
hostile
encampment
till
it
slept
then
slipping
down
stole
through
the
silent
host
carrying
off
a
drowsy
sentinel
or
a
favorite
charger
upon
which
the
daring
spy
flourished
conspicuous
among
his
less
fortunate
companions
the
boldness
of
these
adventurers
was
sometimes
wonderful
almost
beyond
belief
it
was
the
strict
result
of
that
confidence
in
their
woodman
skill
which
the
practice
of
their
leader
and
his
invariable
success
naturally
taught
them
to
entertain
the
mutual
confidence
which
thus
grew
up
between
our
partisan
and
his
men
made
the
business
of
war
in
spite
of
its
peculiar
difficulties
and
privations
a
pleasant
one
as
they
had
no
doubts
of
their
ability
to
conduct
them
to
victory
he
had
no
apprehension
but
when
brought
to
a
meeting
with
the
enemy
that
they
would
secure
it
his
mode
of
battle
was
a
simple
one
generally
very
direct
but
he
was
wonderfully
prompt
in
availing
himself
of
the
exigencies
of
the
affair
his
rule
was
to
know
his
enemy
how
posted
and
in
what
strength
then
if
his
men
were
set
on
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
fight
they
knew
that
he
had
so
placed
them
that
valor
was
the
only
requisite
a
swamp
right
or
left
or
in
his
rear
a
thicket
beside
him
any
spot
in
which
time
could
be
gained
and
an
inexperienced
militia
rallied
long
enough
to
become
reconciled
to
the
unaccustomed
sights
and
sounds
of
war
were
all
that
he
required
in
order
to
secure
a
fit
position
for
fighting
in
he
found
no
difficulty
in
making
good
soldiers
of
them
it
caused
him
no
surprise
and
we
may
add
no
great
concern
that
his
raw
militia
men
armed
with
rifle
and
ducking
gun
should
retire
before
the
pushing
bayonets
of
a
regular
soldiery
he
considered
it
mere
butchery
to
expose
them
to
this
trial
but
he
taught
his
men
to
retire
slowly
to
take
post
behind
the
first
tree
or
thicket
reload
and
try
the
effect
of
a
second
fire
and
so
on
of
a
third
and
fourth
retiring
still
but
never
forgetting
to
take
advantage
of
every
shelter
that
offered
itself
he
expected
them
to
fly
but
not
too
far
to
be
useful
we
shall
see
the
effect
of
this
training
at
eutaw
where
the
militia
in
the
advance
delivered
seventeen
fires
before
they
yielded
to
the
press
of
the
enemy
but
says
johnson
with
equal
truth
and
terseness
that
distrust
of
their
own
immediate
commanders
which
militia
are
too
apt
to
be
affected
with
never
produced
an
emotion
where
marion
and
pickens
commanded
the
history
of
american
warfare
shows
conclusively
that
under
the
right
leaders
the
american
militia
are
as
cool
in
moments
of
danger
as
the
best
drilled
soldiery
in
the
universe
but
they
have
been
a
thousand
times
disgraced
by
imbecile
and
vainglorious
pretenders
history
of
greene
vol
marion
was
admirably
supported
by
his
followers
several
officers
of
the
brigade
were
distinguished
men
of
major
john
james
we
have
already
seen
something
all
the
brothers
were
men
of
courage
and
great
muscular
activity
the
witherspoons
were
similarly
endowed
his
chief
counsellors
were
the
brothers
horry
and
postelle
all
like
himself
descended
from
huguenot
stocks
to
the
two
last
the
brothers
postelle
it
has
been
remarked
that
nothing
appeared
difficult
captains
baxter
and
conyers
were
particularly
distinguished
the
first
for
his
gigantic
frame
which
was
informed
by
a
corresponding
courage
the
latter
by
his
equal
bravery
and
horsemanship
he
was
a
sort
of
in
the
brigade
and
his
behavior
seemed
not
unfrequently
dictated
by
a
passion
for
chivalrous
display
an
anecdote
in
connection
with
conyers
is
told
which
will
serve
to
show
what
was
the
spirit
of
the
patriotic
damsels
of
the
revolution
marion
had
environed
colonel
watson
at
a
plantation
where
mary
the
second
daughter
of
john
witherspoon
was
living
at
the
time
she
was
betrothed
to
conyers
the
gallant
captain
daily
challenged
the
british
posts
skirmishing
in
the
sight
of
his
mistress
his
daring
was
apparent
enough
his
great
skill
and
courage
were
known
he
presented
himself
frequently
before
the
lines
of
the
enemy
either
as
a
single
champion
or
at
the
head
of
his
troop
the
pride
of
the
maiden
heart
may
be
imagined
when
she
heard
the
warning
in
the
camp
as
she
frequently
did
take
care
there
is
conyers
the
insult
was
unresented
but
one
day
when
her
lover
appeared
as
usual
a
british
officer
approaching
her
spoke
sneeringly
or
disrespectfully
of
our
the
high
spirited
girl
drew
the
shoe
from
her
foot
and
flinging
it
in
his
face
exclaimed
coward
go
and
meet
him
the
chronicler
from
whom
we
derive
this
anecdote
is
particularly
careful
to
tell
us
that
it
was
a
walking
shoe
and
not
a
kid
slipper
which
she
made
use
of
by
which
we
are
to
understand
that
she
was
no
ways
tender
of
the
stroke
judge
james
sketch
of
the
horrys
were
both
able
officers
hugh
was
a
particular
favorite
of
marion
for
his
brother
he
had
large
esteem
of
peter
horry
we
have
several
amusing
anecdotes
some
of
which
we
gather
from
himself
it
is
upon
the
authority
of
his
memoir
that
we
depend
for
several
matters
of
interest
in
this
volume
this
memoir
written
in
the
old
age
of
the
author
and
while
he
suffered
from
infirmities
of
age
and
health
is
a
crude
but
not
uninteresting
narrative
of
events
in
his
own
life
and
of
the
war
the
colonel
confesses
himself
very
frankly
in
his
youth
he
had
a
great
passion
for
the
sex
which
led
him
into
frequent
difficulties
these
though
never
very
serious
he
most
seriously
relates
he
was
brave
and
ambitious
of
distinction
this
ambition
led
him
to
desire
a
command
of
cavalry
rather
than
of
infantry
but
he
was
no
rider
was
several
times
unhorsed
in
combat
and
was
indebted
to
the
fidelity
of
his
soldiers
for
his
safety
on
one
occasion
his
escape
was
more
narrow
from
a
different
cause
he
gives
us
a
ludicrous
account
of
it
himself
crossing
the
swamp
at
lynch
creek
to
join
marion
in
the
dark
and
the
swamp
swimming
he
encountered
the
bough
of
a
tree
to
which
he
clung
while
his
horse
passed
from
under
him
he
was
no
swimmer
and
but
for
timely
assistance
from
his
followers
would
have
been
drowned
another
story
which
places
him
in
a
scarcely
less
ludicrous
attitude
is
told
by
garden
he
was
ordered
by
marion
to
wait
in
ambush
the
approach
of
a
british
detachment
the
duty
was
executed
with
skill
the
enemy
was
completely
in
his
power
but
he
labored
under
an
impediment
in
his
speech
which
we
may
readily
suppose
was
greatly
increased
by
anxiety
and
excitement
the
word
fire
stuck
in
his
throat
as
amen
did
in
that
of
macbeth
the
emergency
was
pressing
but
this
only
increased
the
difficulty
in
vain
did
he
make
the
attempt
he
could
say
but
he
could
get
no
further
the
r
was
incorrigible
at
length
irritated
almost
to
madness
he
exclaimed
shoot
d
n
you
shoot
you
know
what
i
would
say
shoot
and
be
d
d
to
you
he
was
present
and
acted
bravely
in
almost
every
affair
of
consequence
in
the
brigade
of
marion
at
quinby
capt
baxter
already
mentioned
a
man
distinguished
by
his
great
strength
and
courage
as
well
as
size
and
by
equally
great
simplicity
of
character
cried
out
i
am
wounded
colonel
think
no
more
of
it
baxter
was
the
answer
of
horry
but
stand
to
your
post
but
i
ca
stand
says
baxter
i
am
wounded
a
second
time
lie
down
then
baxter
but
quit
not
your
post
they
have
shot
me
again
colonel
said
the
wounded
man
and
if
i
stay
any
longer
here
i
shall
be
shot
to
pieces
be
it
so
baxter
but
stir
not
was
the
order
which
the
brave
fellow
obeyed
receiving
a
fourth
wound
before
the
engagement
was
over
memoir
anecdotes
first
series
p
it
was
while
marion
was
lying
with
his
main
force
at
the
camp
at
island
that
two
circumstances
occurred
which
deserve
mention
as
equally
serving
to
illustrate
his
own
and
the
character
of
the
warfare
of
that
time
and
region
one
of
these
occurrences
has
long
been
a
popular
anecdote
and
as
such
has
been
made
the
subject
of
a
very
charming
picture
which
has
done
something
towards
giving
it
a
more
extended
circulation
the
other
is
less
generally
known
but
is
not
less
deserving
of
the
popular
ear
as
distinguishing
quite
as
much
as
the
former
the
purity
simplicity
and
firmness
of
marion
character
it
appears
that
desiring
the
exchange
of
prisoners
a
young
officer
was
dispatched
from
the
british
post
at
georgetown
to
the
swamp
encampment
of
marion
in
order
to
effect
this
object
he
was
encountered
by
one
of
the
scouting
parties
of
the
brigade
carefully
blindfolded
and
conducted
by
intricate
paths
through
the
wild
passes
and
into
the
deep
recesses
of
the
island
here
when
his
eyes
were
uncovered
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
a
motley
multitude
which
might
well
have
reminded
him
of
robin
hood
and
his
outlaws
the
scene
was
unquestionably
wonderfully
picturesque
and
attractive
and
our
young
officer
seems
to
have
been
duly
impressed
by
it
he
was
in
the
middle
of
one
of
those
grand
natural
amphitheatres
so
common
in
our
swamp
forests
in
which
the
massive
pine
the
gigantic
cypress
and
the
stately
and
laurel
streaming
with
moss
and
linking
their
opposite
arms
inflexibly
locked
in
the
embrace
of
centuries
group
together
with
elaborate
limbs
and
leaves
the
chief
and
most
graceful
features
of
gothic
architecture
to
these
recesses
through
the
massed
foliage
of
the
forest
the
sunlight
came
as
sparingly
and
with
rays
as
mellow
and
subdued
as
through
the
painted
window
of
the
old
cathedral
falling
upon
aisle
and
chancel
scattered
around
were
the
forms
of
those
hardy
warriors
with
whom
our
young
officer
was
yet
destined
most
probably
to
meet
in
conflict
strange
or
savage
in
costume
or
attitude
lithe
and
sinewy
of
frame
and
wakeful
at
the
least
alarm
some
slept
some
joined
in
boyish
sports
some
with
foot
in
stirrup
stood
ready
for
the
signal
to
mount
and
march
the
deadly
rifle
leaned
against
the
tree
the
sabre
depended
from
its
boughs
steeds
were
browsing
in
the
shade
with
loosened
bits
but
saddled
ready
at
the
first
sound
of
the
bugle
to
skirr
through
brake
and
thicket
distant
fires
dimly
burning
sent
up
their
faint
white
smokes
that
mingling
with
the
thick
forest
tops
which
they
could
not
pierce
were
scarce
distinguishable
from
the
long
grey
moss
which
made
the
old
trees
look
like
so
many
ancient
patriarchs
but
the
most
remarkable
object
in
all
this
scene
was
marion
himself
could
it
be
that
the
person
who
stood
before
our
visitor
in
stature
of
the
smallest
size
thin
as
well
as
low
was
that
of
the
redoubted
chief
whose
sleepless
activity
and
patriotic
zeal
had
carried
terror
to
the
gates
of
charleston
had
baffled
the
pursuit
and
defied
the
arms
of
the
best
british
captains
had
beaten
the
equal
enemy
and
laughed
at
the
superior
certainly
if
he
were
then
never
were
the
simple
resources
of
intellect
as
distinguishable
from
strength
of
limb
or
powers
of
muscle
so
wonderfully
evident
as
in
this
particular
instance
the
physical
powers
of
marion
were
those
simply
of
endurance
his
frame
had
an
iron
hardihood
derived
from
severe
discipline
and
subdued
desires
and
appetites
but
lacked
the
necessary
muscle
and
capacities
of
the
mere
soldier
it
was
as
the
general
the
commander
the
counsellor
rather
than
as
the
simple
leader
of
his
men
that
marion
takes
rank
and
is
to
be
considered
in
the
annals
of
war
he
attempted
no
physical
achievements
and
seems
to
have
placed
very
little
reliance
upon
his
personal
prowess

lee

he
adds
his
visage
was
not
pleasing
and
his
manners
not
captivating
he
was
reserved
and
silent
entering
into
conversation
only
when
necessary
and
then
with
modesty
and
good
sense
he
possessed
a
strong
mind
improved
by
its
own
reflections
and
observations
not
by
books
or
travel
his
dress
was
like
his
address
plain
regarding
comfort
and
decency
only
in
his
meals
he
was
abstemious
eating
generally
of
one
dish
and
drinking
water
mostly
he
was
sedulous
and
constant
in
his
attention
to
the
duties
of
his
station
to
which
every
other
consideration
yielded
even
the
charms
of
the
fair
like
the
luxuries
of
the
table
and
the
allurements
of
wealth
seemed
to
be
lost
upon
him
the
procurement
of
subsistence
for
his
men
and
the
continuance
of
annoyance
for
his
enemy
engrossed
his
entire
mind
he
was
virtuous
all
over
never
even
in
manner
much
less
in
reality
did
he
trench
upon
right
beloved
by
his
friends
and
respected
by
his
enemies
he
exhibited
a
luminous
example
of
the
beneficial
effects
to
be
produced
by
an
individual
who
with
only
small
means
at
his
command
possesses
a
virtuous
heart
a
strong
head
and
a
mind
directed
to
the
common
good
appendix
to
vol
the
dislike
or
indifference
of
marion
to
anything
like
mere
military
display
was
a
matter
of
occasional
comment
and
some
jest
among
his
followers
among
other
proofs
which
are
given
of
this
indifference
we
are
told
that
on
one
occasion
attempting
to
draw
his
sword
from
the
scabbard
he
failed
to
do
so
in
consequence
of
the
rust
the
result
of
his
infrequent
employment
of
the
weapon
certainly
a
rich
event
in
the
life
of
a
military
man
the
fact
is
that
marion
seldom
used
his
sword
except
in
battle
or
on
occasions
when
its
employment
was
inseparable
from
his
duties
long
swords
were
then
in
fashion
but
he
continued
to
wear
the
small
cut
and
thrust
of
the
second
regiment
such
a
weapon
better
suited
his
inferior
physique
and
necessarily
lessened
the
motives
to
personal
the
british
visitor
was
a
young
man
who
had
never
seen
marion
the
great
generals
whom
he
was
accustomed
to
see
were
great
of
limb
portly
and
huge
of
proportion
such
was
cornwallis
and
others
of
the
british
army
such
too
was
the
case
among
the
americans
the
average
weight
of
these
opposing
generals
during
that
war
is
stated
at
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
the
successes
of
marion
must
naturally
have
led
our
young
englishman
to
look
for
something
in
his
physique
even
above
this
average
and
verging
on
the
gigantic
vastness
seems
always
the
most
necessary
agent
in
provoking
youthful
wonder
and
satisfying
it
his
astonishment
when
they
did
meet
was
in
all
probability
not
of
a
kind
to
lessen
the
partisan
in
his
estimation
that
a
frame
so
slight
and
seemingly
so
feeble
coupled
with
so
much
gentleness
and
so
little
pretension
should
provoke
a
respect
so
general
and
fears
on
one
side
so
impressive
was
well
calculated
to
compel
inquiry
as
to
the
true
sources
of
this
influence
such
an
inquiry
was
in
no
way
detrimental
to
a
reputation
founded
like
marion
on
the
successful
exercise
of
peculiar
mental
endowments
the
young
officer
as
soon
as
his
business
was
dispatched
prepared
to
depart
but
marion
gently
detained
him
as
he
said
for
dinner
which
was
in
preparation
the
mild
and
dignified
simplicity
of
marion
manners
had
already
produced
their
effects
and
to
prolong
so
interesting
an
interview
the
invitation
was
accepted
the
entertainment
was
served
up
on
pieces
of
bark
and
consisted
entirely
of
roasted
potatoes
of
which
the
general
ate
heartily
requesting
his
guest
to
profit
by
his
example
repeating
the
old
adage
that
is
the
best
sauce
but
surely
general
said
the
officer
this
can
not
be
your
ordinary
fare
indeed
sir
it
is
he
replied
and
we
are
fortunate
on
this
occasion
entertaining
company
to
have
more
than
our
usual
allowance
the
story
goes
that
the
young
briton
was
so
greatly
impressed
with
the
occurrence
that
on
his
return
to
georgetown
he
retired
from
the
service
declaring
his
conviction
that
men
who
could
with
such
content
endure
the
privations
of
such
a
life
were
not
to
be
subdued
his
conclusion
was
strictly
logical
and
hence
indeed
the
importance
of
such
a
warfare
as
that
carried
on
by
marion
in
which
if
he
obtained
no
great
victories
he
was
yet
never
to
be
overcome

p
the
next
anecdote
if
less
pleasing
in
its
particulars
is
yet
better
calculated
for
the
development
of
marion
character
the
equal
powers
of
firmness
and
forbearance
which
he
possessed
his
superiority
to
common
emotions
and
the
mingled
gentleness
and
dignity
with
which
he
executed
the
most
unpleasant
duties
of
his
command
marion
had
placed
one
of
his
detachments
at
the
plantation
of
a
george
crofts
on
sampit
creek
this
person
had
proved
invariably
true
to
the
american
cause
had
supplied
the
partisans
secretly
with
the
munitions
of
war
with
cattle
and
provisions
he
was
an
invalid
however
suffering
from
a
mortal
infirmity
which
compelled
his
removal
for
medical
attendance
to
georgetown
then
in
possession
of
the
enemy
during
the
absence
of
the
family
marion
placed
a
sergeant
in
the
for
its
protection
from
this
place
the
guard
was
expelled
by
two
officers
of
the
brigade
and
the
house
stripped
of
its
contents
the
facts
were
first
disclosed
to
marion
by
horry
who
received
them
from
the
wife
of
crofts
this
lady
pointed
to
the
sword
of
her
husband
actually
at
the
side
of
the
principal
offender
the
indignation
of
marion
was
not
apt
to
expend
itself
in
words
redress
was
promised
to
the
complainant
and
she
was
dismissed
marion
proceeded
with
all
diligence
to
the
recovery
of
the
property
but
his
course
was
governed
by
prudence
as
well
as
decision
the
offenders
were
men
of
some
influence
and
had
a
small
faction
in
the
brigade
which
had
already
proved
troublesome
and
might
be
dangerous
one
of
them
was
a
major
the
other
a
captain
their
names
are
both
before
us
in
the
memoir
of
horry
whose
copious
detail
on
this
subject
leaves
nothing
to
be
supplied
we
forbear
giving
them
as
their
personal
publication
would
answer
no
good
purpose
they
were
in
command
of
a
body
of
men
about
sixty
in
number
known
as
the
georgia
refugees
upon
the
minds
of
these
men
the
offenders
had
already
sought
to
act
in
reference
to
the
expected
collision
with
their
general
marion
made
his
preparations
with
his
ordinary
quietness
and
then
dispatched
horry
to
the
person
who
was
in
possession
of
the
sword
of
croft
for
which
he
made
a
formal
demand
he
refused
to
give
it
up
alleging
that
it
was
his
and
taken
in
war
if
the
general
wants
it
he
added
let
him
come
for
it
himself
when
this
reply
was
communicated
to
marion
he
instructed
horry
to
renew
the
demand
his
purpose
seems
to
have
been
discovering
the
temper
of
the
offender
to
gain
the
necessary
time
his
officers
meanwhile
were
gathering
around
him
he
was
making
his
preparations
for
a
struggle
which
might
be
bloody
which
might
indeed
involve
not
only
the
safety
of
his
brigade
but
his
own
future
usefulness
horry
however
with
proper
spirit
entreated
not
to
be
sent
again
to
the
offender
giving
as
a
reason
for
his
reluctance
that
in
consequence
of
the
previous
rudeness
of
the
other
he
was
not
in
the
mood
to
tolerate
a
repetition
of
the
indignity
and
might
if
irritated
be
provoked
to
violence
marion
then
dispatched
his
orderly
to
the
guilty
major
with
a
request
civilly
worded
that
he
might
see
him
at
head
quarters
he
appeared
accordingly
accompanied
by
the
captain
who
had
joined
with
him
in
the
outrage
and
under
whose
influence
he
appeared
to
act
marion
renewed
his
demand
in
person
for
the
sword
of
croft
the
other
again
refused
to
deliver
it
alleging
that
croft
was
a
tory
and
even
then
with
the
enemy
in
georgetown
the
brigade
of
marion
was
for
a
long
period
without
medical
attendance
or
a
surgeon
to
dress
his
wounded
if
a
wound
reached
an
artery
the
patient
bled
to
death
to
illustrate
the
fierce
hostility
of
whigs
and
tories
a
single
anecdote
will
suffice
on
one
occasion
horry
had
three
men
wounded
near
georgetown
a
surgeon
of
the
tories
was
then
a
prisoner
in
his
ranks
yet
he
positively
refused
to
dress
the
wounds
and
suffered
a
fine
youth
named
kolb
to
bleed
to
death
before
his
eyes
from
a
slight
injury
upon
the
will
you
deliver
me
the
sword
or
not
major
was
the
answer
which
marion
made
to
this
suggestion
i
will
not
was
the
reply
of
the
offender
at
these
words
says
horry
in
the
before
us
i
could
forbear
no
longer
and
said
with
great
warmth
g
d
sir
did
i
command
this
brigade
as
you
do
i
would
hang
them
both
up
in
half
an
hour
marion
sternly
replied
is
none
of
your
business
sir
they
are
both
before
me
sergeant
of
the
guard
bring
me
a
file
of
men
with
loaded
arms
and
fixed
bayonets
was
silent
adds
horry
our
field
officers
in
camp
were
present
and
when
the
second
refusal
of
the
sword
was
given
they
all
put
their
hands
to
their
swords
in
readiness
to
draw
my
own
sword
was
already
drawn
in
the
regular
service
and
with
officers
accustomed
to
and
bred
up
in
the
severe
and
stern
sense
of
authority
which
is
usually
thought
necessary
to
a
proper
discipline
the
refractory
offender
would
most
probably
have
been
hewn
down
in
the
moment
of
his
disobedience
the
effect
of
such
a
proceeding
in
the
present
instance
might
have
been
of
the
most
fatal
character
the
de
corps
might
have
prompted
the
immediate
followers
of
the
offender
to
have
seized
upon
their
weapons
and
though
annihilated
as
horry
tells
us
they
would
have
been
yet
several
valuable
lives
might
have
been
lost
which
the
country
could
ill
have
spared
the
mutiny
would
have
been
put
down
but
at
what
a
price
the
patience
and
prudence
of
marion
character
taught
him
forbearance
his
mildness
by
putting
the
offender
entirely
in
the
wrong
so
justified
his
severity
as
to
disarm
the
followers
of
the
criminals
these
as
we
have
already
said
were
about
sixty
in
number
horry
continues
their
intentions
were
to
call
upon
these
men
for
support
our
officers
well
knew
that
they
meant
if
possible
to
intimidate
marion
so
as
to
make
him
come
into
their
measures
of
plunder
and
the
affair
fortunately
terminated
without
bloodshed
the
prudence
of
the
general
had
its
effect
the
delay
gave
time
to
the
offenders
for
reflection
perhaps
looking
round
upon
their
followers
they
saw
no
consenting
spirit
of
mutiny
in
their
eyes
encouraging
their
own
for
though
many
of
these
refugees
were
present
none
offered
to
back
or
support
the
mutinous
officers
and
when
the
guard
that
was
ordered
appeared
in
sight
the
companion
of
the
chief
offender
was
seen
to
touch
the
arm
of
the
other
who
then
proffered
the
sword
to
marion
saying
general
you
need
not
have
sent
for
the
guard
marion
refusing
to
receive
it
referred
him
to
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
and
thus
doubly
degraded
the
dishonored
major
of
continentals
for
he
was
such
disappeared
from
sight
followed
by
his
associate
his
farther
punishment
was
of
a
kind
somewhat
differing
from
those
which
are
common
to
armies
by
which
the
profession
of
arms
is
sometimes
quite
as
much
dishonored
as
the
criminal
marion
endeavored
by
his
punishments
to
elevate
the
sense
of
character
in
the
spectators
he
had
some
of
the
notions
of
napoleon
on
this
subject
he
was
averse
to
those
brutal
punishments
which
in
the
creature
degrade
the
glorious
image
of
the
creator
in
the
case
of
the
two
offenders
thus
dismissed
from
his
presence
the
penalty
was
of
all
others
the
most
terrible
to
persons
in
whose
minds
there
remained
the
sparks
even
of
a
conventional
honor
these
men
had
been
guilty
of
numerous
offences
against
humanity
marion
expelled
them
from
his
brigade
subsequently
their
actions
became
such
that
he
proclaimed
their
outlawry
through
the
country
by
one
of
these
men
he
was
challenged
to
single
combat
but
he
treated
the
summons
with
deserved
contempt
his
composure
remained
unruffled
by
the
circumstance
horry
from
which
the
several
extracts
preceding
have
been
pp
he
set
up
on
trees
and
houses
in
public
places
proclamations
in
substance
thus
that
major
and
capt
did
not
belong
to
his
brigade
that
they
were
banditti
robbers
and
thieves
were
hereby
deemed
out
of
the
laws
and
might
be
killed
wherever
horry
pp
in
this
affair
as
in
numerous
others
marion
great
knowledge
of
the
militia
service
and
of
the
peculiar
people
with
whom
he
sometimes
had
to
deal
enabled
him
to
relieve
himself
with
little
difficulty
from
troublesome
companions
of
these
he
necessarily
had
many
for
the
exigencies
of
the
country
were
such
that
patriotism
was
not
permitted
to
be
too
nice
in
the
material
which
it
was
compelled
to
employ
the
refugees
were
from
various
quarters
were
sometimes
as
we
have
seen
adopted
into
his
ranks
from
those
of
the
defeated
tories
and
were
frequently
grossly
ignorant
not
only
of
what
was
due
to
the
community
in
which
they
found
themselves
but
still
more
ignorant
of
the
obligations
of
that
military
law
to
which
they
voluntarily
put
themselves
in
subjection
marion
modes
of
punishment
happily
reached
all
such
cases
without
making
the
unhappy
offender
pay
too
dearly
for
the
sin
of
ignorance
on
one
occasion
horry
tells
us
that
he
carried
before
him
a
prisoner
charged
with
desertion
to
the
enemy
marion
released
him
saying
to
me
him
go
he
is
too
worthless
to
deserve
the
consideration
of
a
court
martial
such
a
decision
in
such
a
case
would
have
shocked
a
military
martinet
and
yet
in
all
probability
the
fellow
thus
discharged
never
repeated
the
offence
and
fought
famously
afterwards
in
the
cause
of
his
merciful
commander
we
have
something
yet
to
learn
on
these
subjects
the
result
of
a
system
in
which
scorn
is
so
equally
blended
with
mercy
was
singularly
good
in
the
case
of
the
person
offending
as
is
frequently
the
case
among
militia
through
sheer
ignorance
of
martial
law
it
teaches
while
it
punishes
and
reforms
in
some
degree
the
being
which
it
saves
where
the
fault
flows
from
native
worthlessness
of
character
the
effect
is
not
less
beneficial
one
of
marion
modes
of
getting
rid
of
worthless
officers
was
to
put
them
into
coventry
in
this
practice
his
good
officers
joined
him
and
their
sympathy
and
cooperation
soon
secured
his
object
he
kept
a
list
of
them
said
horry
which
he
called
his
black
list
this
mode
answered
so
well
that
many
resigned
their
commissions
and
the
brigade
was
thus
fortunately
rid
of
such
worthless
fellows
the
values
of
such
a
riddance
is
well
shown
by
another
sentence
from
the
of
our
veteran

found
the

by

the
influence
of

quite

much
disparaged

for
this

leaders
in

no

would
have
sufficed
for
the
recovery
of
the
two
almost
isolated
states

indeed
we

to
think
that

almost
entirely
to
those
places

not
meant
by
this
to
lessen
in
any
degree
the
value
of
the

rendered
by

these
were
very
great
and
contributed
in
large
measure
to
bring
the

an
early
and
a
happy
issue
it
is
only
intended
to
insist
upon
those
claims
of
the

unasserted
by

a
brigadier
greene
proceeded
in
the
duties
of
his
command
with
characteristic
vigilance
and
vigor
he
soon
put
his
army
under
marching
orders
for
the
pedee
which
river
he
reached
on
the
of
december
he
took
post
near
hicks
creek
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
before
leaving
camp
charlotte
he
had
judiciously
made
up
an
independent
brigade
for
general
morgan
composed
of
his
most
efficient
soldiers
it
consisted
of
a
corps
of
light
infantry
detached
from
the
maryland
line
of
men
a
body
of
virginia
militia
of
men
and
washington
cavalry
perhaps
one
hundred
more
morgan
was
to
be
joined
on
reaching
the
tract
of
country
assigned
to
his
operations
in
south
carolina
by
the
militia
lately
under
sumter
that
gallant
leader
being
still
de
combat
in
consequence
of
the
severe
wound
received
at
blackstock
the
force
of
morgan
was
expected
to
be
still
farther
increased
by
volunteer
militia
from
north
carolina
and
he
received
a
powerful
support
in
the
cooperation
of
pickens
with
the
well
exercised
militia
under
his
command
the
object
of
this
detachment
was
to
give
confidence
and
encouragement
to
the
country
to
inspirit
the
patriots
overawe
the
tories
and
facilitate
the
accumulation
of
the
necessary
provisions
the
main
army
at
hicks
creek
meanwhile
formed
a
camp
of
repose
this
was
necessary
as
well
as
time
and
training
to
its
usefulness
it
was
sadly
deficient
in
all
the
munitions
and
materials
of
war
the
mere
skeleton
of
an
army
thin
in
numbers
and
in
a
melancholy
state
of
nakedness
were
you
to
arrive
says
greene
in
a
letter
to
lafayette
dated
december
you
would
find
a
few
ragged
troops
in
the
wilderness
destitute
of
everything
necessary
for
either
the
comfort
or
convenience
of
soldiers
the
department
was
not
only
in
a
deplorable
condition
but
the
country
was
laid
waste
such
a
warfare
as
had
been
pursued
among
the
inhabitants
beggars
description
the
whole
body
of
the
population
seems
to
have
been
in
arms
at
one
time
or
another
and
unhappily
from
causes
already
discussed
in
opposite
ranks
a
civil
war
as
history
teaches
is
like
no
other
like
a
religious
war
the
elements
of
a
fanatical
passion
seem
to
work
the
mind
up
to
a
degree
of
ferocity
which
is
not
common
among
the
usual
provocations
of
hate
in
ordinary
warfare
the
inhabitants
says
greene
pursue
each
other
with
savage
fury
the
whigs
and
the
tories
are
butchering
one
another
hourly
the
war
here
is
upon
a
very
different
scale
from
what
it
is
to
the
northward
it
is
a
plain
business
there
the
geography
of
the
country
reduces
its
operations
to
two
or
three
points
but
here
it
is
everywhere
and
the
country
is
so
full
of
deep
rivers
and
impassable
creeks
and
swamps
that
you
are
always
liable
to
misfortunes
of
a
capital
nature
the
geographical
character
of
the
country
as
described
by
greene
is
at
once
suggestive
of
the
partisan
warfare
it
is
the
true
sort
of
warfare
for
such
a
country
the
sparseness
of
its
settlements
and
the
extent
of
its
plains
indicate
the
employment
of
cavalry
the
intricate
woods
and
swamps
as
strikingly
denote
the
uses
and
importance
of
riflemen
the
brigade
of
marion
combined
the
qualities
of
both
general
greene
unlike
his
predecessor
knew
the
value
of
such
services
as
those
of
marion
on
taking
command
at
charlotte
the
very
day
after
his
arrival
he
thus
writes
to
our
partisan
i
have
not
says
he
the
honor
of
your
acquaintance
but
am
no
stranger
to
your
character
and
merit
your
services
in
the
lower
part
of
south
carolina
in
awing
the
tories
and
preventing
the
enemy
from
extending
their
limits
have
been
very
important
and
it
is
my
earnest
desire
that
you
continue
where
you
are
until
farther
advice
from
me
your
letter
of
the
of
last
month
to
general
gates
is
before
me
i
am
fully
sensible
your
service
is
hard
and
sufferings
great
but
how
great
the
prize
for
which
we
contend
i
like
your
plan
of
frequently
shifting
your
ground
it
frequently
prevents
a
surprise
and
perhaps
a
total
loss
of
your
party
until
a
more
permanent
army
can
be
collected
than
is
in
the
field
at
present
we
must
endeavor
to
keep
up
a
partisan
war
and
preserve
the
tide
of
sentiment
among
the
people
in
our
favor
as
much
as
possible
spies
are
the
eyes
of
an
army
and
without
them
a
general
is
always
groping
in
the
dark
and
can
neither
secure
himself
nor
annoy
his
enemy
at
present
i
am
badly
off
for
intelligence
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
that
i
get
the
earliest
intelligence
of
any
reinforcement
which
may
arrive
at
charleston
i
wish
you
therefore
to
fix
some
plan
for
procuring
such
information
and
conveying
it
to
me
with
all
possible
dispatch
the
spy
should
be
taught
to
be
particular
in
his
inquiries
and
get
the
names
of
the
corps
strength
and
commanding
officer
name
place
from
whence
they
came
and
where
they
are
going
it
will
be
best
to
fix
upon
somebody
in
town
to
do
this
and
have
a
runner
between
you
and
him
to
give
you
the
intelligence
as
a
person
who
lives
out
of
town
can
not
make
the
inquiries
without
being
suspected
the
utmost
secrecy
will
be
necessary
in
the
business
this
letter
found
marion
at
one
of
his
lurking
places
on
black
river
it
was
properly
addressed
to
him
he
was
the
man
who
of
all
others
was
not
only
best
acquainted
with
the
importance
of
good
information
furnished
promptly
but
who
had
never
been
without
his
spies
and
runners
from
the
first
moment
when
he
took
the
field
he
readily
assumed
the
duty
and
upon
him
greene
wholly
relied
for
his
intelligence
of
every
sort
every
occurrence
in
charleston
georgetown
and
the
whole
low
country
was
promptly
furnished
to
the
commander
to
whom
however
marion
complains
generally
of
the
embarrassment
in
procuring
intelligence
arising
from
the
want
of
a
little
hard
money
but
this
want
was
quite
as
great
in
the
camp
of
greene
as
in
that
of
the
partisan
it
is
probable
that
marion
had
communicated
to
general
gates
a
desire
to
strengthen
his
militia
with
a
small
force
of
regular
troops
with
such
a
force
it
was
expected
that
something
of
a
more
decisive
nature
could
be
effected
his
eye
was
upon
georgetown
the
capture
of
that
post
was
particularly
desirable
on
many
accounts
and
if
his
views
and
wishes
were
not
communicated
to
gates
they
were
to
greene
who
subsequently
made
his
dispositions
for
promoting
them
while
the
latter
was
moving
down
to
his
camp
at
hicks
creek
marion
was
engaged
in
some
very
active
movements
against
a
party
under
mcarthur
and
coffin
and
between
that
and
the
high
hills
of
the
santee
to
cut
off
his
retreat
by
the
pedee
a
strong
detachment
had
been
pushed
on
from
charleston
to
georgetown
intended
to
intercept
him
by
ascending
the
north
bank
of
the
pedee
river
but
marion
informed
of
the
movement
readily
divined
its
object
and
retiring
across
the
country
took
a
strong
position
on
creek
in
the
vicinity
of
his
favorite
retreat
at
snow
island
where
he
always
kept
a
force
to
guard
his
boats
and
overawe
the
tories
the
moment
his
pursuers
had
left
the
ground
marion
resumed
offensive
operations
upon
it
in
a
short
time
his
parties
were
pushed
down
to
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
georgetown
on
all
the
rivers
that
flow
into
the
bay
of
winyaw
his
smaller
parties
were
actively
busy
in
collecting
boats
and
transferring
provisions
to
snow
island
this
was
with
the
twofold
purpose
of
straitening
the
enemy
and
supplying
the
continental
army
in
the
meantime
with
a
respectable
force
of
mounted
infantry
he
himself
pressed
closely
upon
the
town
watching
an
opportunity
when
he
might
attempt
something
with
a
prospect
of
success
but
the
british
confined
themselves
to
their
redoubts
marion
had
neither
bayonets
nor
artillery
with
one
hundred
continental
troops
he
writes
with
his
usual
modesty
to
greene
he
should
be
able
to
render
important
services
while
thus
employed
he
received
intelligence
that
the
loyalists
were
embodying
above
him
in
great
force
under
hector
mcneill
they
were
at
amy
mill
on
drowning
creek
and
were
emboldened
by
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
main
army
was
entirely
destitute
of
cavalry
marion
was
not
able
to
detach
a
force
sufficient
for
their
dispersion
and
it
would
have
been
fatal
to
his
safety
to
suffer
them
to
descend
upon
him
while
his
detachments
were
abroad
his
first
measures
were
to
call
in
his
scattered
parties
he
then
communicated
to
greene
the
necessity
of
reinforcing
him
against
his
increasing
enemies
and
in
particular
of
addressing
himself
to
the
movements
of
mcneill
as
he
supposed
them
to
be
directed
in
part
against
the
country
between
the
waccamaw
and
the
which
had
never
been
ravaged
and
which
at
this
time
held
abundance
of
provisions
to
this
communication
greene
replies
i
have
detached
major
anderson
with
one
thousand
regulars
and
one
hundred
virginia
militia
to
attack
and
disperse
the
tories
at
amy
mill
on
drowning
creek
the
party
marched
yesterday
with
orders
to
endeavor
to
surprise
them
perhaps
you
might
be
able
to
make
some
detachment
that
would
contribute
to
their
success
i
wish
your
answer
respecting
the
practicability
of
surprising
the
party
near
nelson
the
route
and
force
you
will
be
able
to
detach
this
inquiry
is
a
matter
that
requires
great
secrecy
another
letter
of
greene
three
days
after

refers
to
some
skirmishes
between
your
people
and
the
enemy
which
says
greene
do
them
honor
but
of
which
we
have
no
particulars
the

begs
for
a
supply
of
horses
get
as
many
as
you
can
and
let
us
have
fifteen
or
twenty
sent
to

being
wanted
for

after
the
preceding
greene
communicates
to
marion
the
defeat
of
tarleton
by
morgan
at
the
celebrated
battle
of
the
cowpens
on
the
at
daybreak
the
enemy
consisting
of
eleven
hundred
and
fifty
british
troops
and
fifty
militia
attacked
general
morgan
who
was
at
the
cowpens
between
pacolet
and
broad
rivers
with
infantry
eighty
cavalry
and
about
six
hundred
militia
the
action
lasted
fifty
minutes
and
was
remarkably
severe
our
brave
troops
charged
the
enemy
with
bayonets
and
entirely
routed
them
killing
nearly
one
hundred
and
fifty
wounding
upwards
of
two
hundred
and
taking
more
than
five
hundred
prisoners
exclusive
of
the
prisoners
with
two
pieces
of
artillery
wagons
upwards
of
one
hundred
dragoon
horses
and
with
the
loss
of
only
ten
men
killed
and
wounded
our
intrepid
party
pursued
the
enemy
upwards
of
twenty
miles
about
thirty
commissioned
officers
are
among
the
prisoners
tarleton
had
his
horse
killed
and
was
wounded
but
made
his
escape
with
two
hundred
of
his
troops
before
receiving
this
grateful
intelligence
marion
had
been
joined
by
lee
at
the
head
of
a
legion
which
acquired
high
reputation
for
its
spirit
and
activity
during
the
war
lee
tells
us
that
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
find
our
partisan
an
officer
with
a
small
party
preceded
lee
a
few
days
march
to
find
out
marion
who
was
known
to
vary
his
position
in
the
swamps
of
the
pedee
sometimes
in
south
carolina
sometimes
in
north
carolina
and
sometimes
on
the
black
river
with
the
greatest
difficulty
did
this
officer
learn
how
to
communicate
with
the
brigadier
and
that
by
the
accident
of
hearing
among
our
friends
on
the
south
side
of
the
pedee
of
a
small
provision
party
of
marion
being
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
making
himself
known
to
this
party
he
was
conveyed
to
the
general
who
had
changed
his
ground
since
his
party
left
him
which
occasioned
many
hours
search
even
before
his
own
men
could
find
him
lee

note
this
henry
lee
harry
later
became
the
father
of
robert
edward
a
this
anecdote
illustrates
the
wary
habits
of
our
partisan
and
one
of
the
modes
by
which
he
so
successfully
baffled
the
numerous
and
superior
parties
who
were
dispatched
in
his
pursuit
we
have
given
elsewhere
from
lee
memoirs
a
brief
description
of
marion
and
his
mode
of
warfare
taken
from
the
appendix
to
that
work
but
another
occurs
in
the
text
before
us
which
as
it
is
brief
differing
somewhat
in
phrase
and
somewhat
more
comprehensive
than
the
former
will
no
doubt
contribute
to
the
value
and
interest
of
our
narrative
marion
says
lee
was
about
years
of
age
small
in
stature
hard
in
visage
healthy
abstemious
and
taciturn
enthusiastically
wedded
to
the
cause
of
liberty
he
deeply
deplored
the
doleful
condition
of
his
beloved
country
the
common
weal
was
his
sole
object
nothing
selfish
nothing
mercenary
soiled
his
ermine
character
fertile
in
stratagem
he
struck
unperceived
and
retiring
to
those
hidden
retreats
selected
by
himself
in
the
morasses
of
pedee
and
black
rivers
he
placed
his
corps
not
only
out
of
the
reach
of
his
foe
but
often
out
of
the
discovery
of
his
friends
a
rigid
disciplinarian
he
reduced
to
practice
the
justice
of
his
heart
and
during
the
difficult
course
of
warfare
through
which
he
passed
calumny
itself
never
charged
him
with
molesting
the
rights
of
person
property
or
humanity
never
avoiding
danger
he
never
rashly
sought
it
and
acting
for
all
around
him
as
he
did
for
himself
he
risked
the
lives
of
his
troops
only
when
it
was
necessary
never
elated
with
prosperity
nor
depressed
by
adversity
he
preserved
an
equanimity
which
won
the
admiration
of
his
friends
and
exalted
the
respect
of
his
enemies
lee
memoirs
vol
p
such
were
lee
opinions
of
the
partisan
to
whose
assistance
he
was
dispatched
by
greene
with
his
legion
consisting
of
near
three
hundred
men
horse
and
foot
the
junction
of
lee
troops
with
those
of
marion
led
to
the
enterprise
which
the
other
had
long
since
had
at
heart
the
capture
of
the
british
garrison
at
georgetown
georgetown
was
a
small
village
the
situation
and
importance
of
which
have
already
been
described
the
garrison
consisted
of
two
hundred
men
commanded
by
colonel
campbell
his
defences
in
front
were
slight
and
not
calculated
to
resist
artillery
between
these
defences
and
the
town
and
contiguous
to
each
was
an
enclosed
work
with
a
frieze
and
palisade
which
constituted
his
chief
protection
it
was
held
by
a
subaltern
guard
the
rest
of
the
troops
were
dispersed
in
light
parties
in
and
near
the
town
and
looking
towards
the
country
it
was
planned
by
the
assailants
to
convey
a
portion
of
their
force
secretly
down
the
pedee
and
land
them
in
the
water
suburb
of
the
town
which
being
deemed
secure
was
left
unguarded
this
body
was
then
to
move
in
two
divisions
the
first
was
to
force
the
commandant
quarters
the
place
of
parade
to
secure
him
and
all
others
who
might
flock
thither
on
the
alarm
the
second
was
designed
to
intercept
such
of
the
garrison
as
might
endeavor
to
gain
the
fort
the
partisan
militia
and
the
cavalry
of
the
legion
led
by
marion
and
lee
in
person
were
to
approach
the
place
in
the
night
to
lie
concealed
and
when
the
entrance
of
the
other
parties
into
the
town
should
be
announced
they
were
to
penetrate
to
their
assistance
and
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
affair

plan
promised
well

boats
dropped
down
the
pedee
sheltered
from
discovery
by
the
deep
swamps
and
dense
forests
which
lined
its
banks
until
he
reached
an
island
at
its
mouth
within
a
few
miles
of
georgetown
here
he
landed
and
lay
concealed
during
the
day
the
night
after
marion
and
lee
proceeded
to
their
place
of
destination
which
they
reached
by
twelve
when
hearing
the
expected
signal
they
rushed
into
the
town
marion
leading
his
militia
and
lee
his
dragoons
prepared
to
bear
down
all
opposition
but
they
found
all
the
work
already
over
which
it
was
in
the
power
of
the
present
assailants
to
attempt
the
two
parties
of
infantry
the
one
led
by
carnes
the
other
by
rudolph
had
reached
their
places
but
perhaps
not
in
good
season
the
surprise
was
incomplete
they
delayed
too
long
upon
the
way
instead
of
pushing
up
directly
upon
the
redoubt
they
were
also
delayed
by
the
desire
of
securing
the
person
of
the
commandant
an
unimportant
consideration
in
comparison
with
the
stronghold
of
the
garrison
which
assailed
vigorously
at
the
first
alarm
must
have
fallen
into
their
hands
the
commandant
was
secured
and
carnes
judiciously
posted
his
division
for
seizing
such
parties
of
the
garrison
as
might
flock
to
the
rudolph
had
also
gained
his
appointed
station
in
the
vicinity
of
the
fort
and
so
distributed
his
corps
as
to
prevent
all
communication
with
it
but
this
was
not
probably
achieved
with
sufficient
rapidity
and
the
garrison
was
strengthening
itself
while
the
americans
were
busy
in
catching
campbell
and
cutting
down
the
fugitives
when
marion
and
lee
appeared
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
no
enemy
to
be
seen
not
a
british
soldier
appeared
on
parade
no
one
attempted
either
to
gain
the
fort
or
repair
to
the
commandant
the
troops
of
the
garrison
simply
hugged
their
respective
quarters
and
barricaded
the
doors
the
assailants
were
unprovided
with
the
necessary
implements
for
battering
or
bombarding
the
fort
was
in
possession
of
the
british
and
daylight
was
approaching
and
thus
this
bold
and
brilliant
attempt
was
baffled
it
is
difficult
at
this
time
of
day
to
say
how
lee
was
dissatisfied
with
the
result
marion
more
modestly
in
a
letter
to
greene
says
lee
informed
you
yesterday
by
express
of
our
little
success
on
georgetown
which
could
not
be
greater
without
artillery
lee
says
if
instead
of
placing
division
to
intercept
the
fugitives
it
had
been
ordered
to
carry
the
fort
by
the
bayonet
our
success
would
have
been
complete
the
fort
taken
and
the
commandant
a
prisoner
we
might
have
availed
ourselves
of
the
cannon
and
have
readily
demolished
every
obstacle
and
shelter
there
were
probably
several
causes
combined
which
baffled
the
perfect
success
of
the
enterprise
the
guides
are
said
to
have
blundered
there
was
too
much
time
lost
in
capturing
campbell
and
probably
in
the
prosecution
of
some
private
revenges
a
circuitous
route
was
taken
by
carnes
when
a
direct
one
might
have
been
had
by
which
his
entrance
into
the
town
was
delayed
until
near
daylight
and
by
one
account
the
advance
of
marion
and
lee
was
not
in
season
the
simple
secret
of
failure
was
probably
a
want
of
concert
between
the
parties
by
which
the
british
had
time
to
recover
from
their
alarm
and
put
themselves
in
a
state
of
preparation
many
of
the
british
were
killed
few
taken
among
the
former
was
major
irvine
who
was
slain
by
lieut
cryer
whom
on
a
former
occasion
he
had
subjected
to
a
cruel
punishment
of
five
hundred
lashes
campbell
was
suffered
to
remain
on
parole
though
failing
of
its
object
yet
the
audacity
which
marked
the
enterprise
and
the
partial
success
of
the
attempt
were
calculated
to
have
their
effect
upon
the
fears
of
the
enemy
it
was
the
first
of
a
series
of
movements
against
their
several
fortified
posts
by
which
their
power
was
to
be
broken
up
in
detail
its
present
effect
was
to
discourage
the
removal
of
forces
from
the
seaboard
to
the
interior
to
prevent
any
accession
of
strength
to
the
army
of
cornwallis
who
now
roused
by
the
defeat
of
tarleton
was
rapidly
pressing
with
all
his
array
upon
the
heels
of
morgan
the
american
plan
of
operations
of
which
this
de
main
constituted
a
particular
of
some
importance
had
for
its
object
to
keep
cornwallis
from
virginia
to
detain
him
in
south
carolina
until
an
army
of
sufficient
strength
could
be
collected
for
his
overthrow
this
plan
had
been
the
subject
of
much
earnest
correspondence
between
greene
marion
and
others
of
the
american
officers
that
part
of
it
which
contemplated
the
conquest
of
georgetown
harmonized
immediately
with
the
long
cherished
objects
of
our
partisan
halting
but
a
few
hours
to
rest
their
troops
marion
and
lee
after
the
attempt
on
georgetown
moved
the
same
day
directly
up
the
north
bank
of
the
santee
towards
nelson
ferry
their
object
was
the
surprise
of
watson
who
had
taken
post
there
but
though
the
march
was
conducted
with
equal
caution
and
celerity
it
became
known
to
the
threatened
party
watson
consulting
his
fears
did
not
wait
to
receive
them
but
throwing
a
garrison
of
about
eighty
men
into
fort
watson
five
miles
above
the
ferry
hurried
off
to
camden
upon
the
defeat
of
tarleton
by
morgan
general
greene
hastened
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
force
conducted
by
the
latter
which
was
then
in
full
flight
before
the
superior
army
of
cornwallis
orders
from
greene
to
lee
found
him
preparing
for
further
cooperations
with
marion
which
they
arrested
lee
was
summoned
to
join
the
with
his
whole
legion
and
marion
was
thus
deprived
of
the
further
use
which
he
so
much
coveted
of
the
continentals
but
this
diminution
of
force
did
not
lessen
the
activity
of
the
latter
on
the
january
he
sent
out
two
small
detachments
of
thirty
men
each
under
colonel
and
major
postelle
to
strike
at
the
smaller
british
posts
beyond
the
santee
these
parties
were
successful
in
several
affairs
a
great
quantity
of
valuable
stores
were
burnt
at
manigault
ferry
and
in
the
vicinity
at
keithfield
near
monk
corner
major
postelle
captured
forty
of
the
british
regulars
without
the
loss
of
a
man
here
also
fourteen
baggage
wagons
with
all
their
stores
were
committed
to
the
flames
the
proceedings
of
these
parties
conducted
with
caution
and
celerity
were
exceedingly
successful
in
giving
his
instructions
to
the
officers
entrusted
with
these
duties
marion
writes
you
will
consider
provisions
of
all
kinds
british
property
the
destruction
of
all
the
british
stores
in
the
places
is
of
the
greatest
consequence
to
us
and
only
requires
boldness
and
expedition
about
this
time
marion
organized
four
new
companies
of
cavalry
this
proceeding
was
prompted
by
the
scarcity
of
ammunition
his
rifles
were
comparatively
useless
and
the
want
of
powder
and
ball
rendered
it
necessary
that
he
should
rely
upon
some
other
weapons
to
provide
broadswords
for
his
troops
he
was
compelled
once
more
to
put
in
requisition
the
mill
saws
of
the
country
and
his
blacksmiths
were
busy
in
manufacturing
blades
which
as
we
are
told
by
a
contemporary
were
sufficiently
keen
and
massy
to
hew
a
man
down
at
a
blow
this
body
of
cavalry
he
assigned
to
the
command
of
horry
horry
was
an
admirable
infantry
officer
his
ability
to
manage
a
squadron
of
cavalry
was
yet
to
be
ascertained
he
labored
under
one
disqualification
as
he
plainly
tells
us
in
his
own
manuscript
he
was
not
much
of
a
horseman
but
he
had
several
excellent
officers
under
him
as
the
brigade
was
not
strong
enough
to
allow
of
the
employment
in
body
of
his
whole
command
its
operations
were
commonly
by
detachment
the
colonel
at
the
head
of
one
of
his
parties
consisting
of
sixty
men
had
soon
an
opportunity
of
testing
his
capacity
and
fortune
in
this
new
command
we
glean
the
adventure
from
his
own
manuscript
he
was
sent
to
the
waccamaw
to
reconnoitre
and
drive
off
some
cattle
after
crossing
socastee
swamp
a
famous
resort
for
the
tories
he
heard
of
a
party
of
british
dragoons
under
colonel
campbell
horry
men
had
found
a
fine
english
charger
hid
in
a
swamp
this
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
mount
in
order
to
spare
his
own
it
so
happened
somewhat
unfortunately
for
him
that
he
did
so
with
an
enemy
at
hand
with
his
own
horse
he
was
sufficiently
familiar
to
escape
ordinary
accidents
it
will
be
seen
that
he
incurred
some
risks
with
the
more
spirited
quadruped
his
patrol
had
brought
in
a
negro
whom
he
placed
under
guard
he
had
in
his
command
a
captain
clarke
who
knowing
the
negro
set
him
free
during
the
night
reader
says
our
colonel
with
a
serenity
that
is
delightful
behold
a
militia
captain
releasing
a
prisoner
confined
by
his
colonel
commandant
and
see
the
consequence
the
negro
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
british
and
conducted
them
upon
the
steps
of
our
partisan
it
so
happened
that
the
same
captain
clarke
who
seems
to
have
been
a
sad
simpleton
and
something
of
a
poltroon
had
been
sent
in
front
with
five
horsemen
as
an
advanced
guard
near
the
great
waccamaw
road
the
bugles
of
the
british
were
heard
sounding
the
charge
horry
was
fortunately
prepared
for
the
enemy
but
such
was
not
the
case
with
clarke
he
confounded
the
martial
tones
of
the
bugle
with
the
sylvan
notes
of
the
horn
stop
says
our
militia
captain
to
his
men
stop
and
you
will
see
the
deer
dogs
and
huntsmen
as
they
cross
the
road
he
himself
happened
to
be
the
silly
deer
the
huntsmen
were
upon
him
in
a
few
moments
and
he
discovered
his
mistake
only
when
their
broadswords
were
about
his
ears
he
was
taken
but
escaped
a
short
encounter
followed
between
campbell
and
horry
in
which
the
former
was
worsted
six
of
his
men
fell
at
the
first
fire
three
slain
and
as
many
wounded
horry
pieces
were
common
shot
guns
and
the
only
shot
that
he
had
were
swan
shot
or
the
mischief
would
have
been
greater
campbell
horse
was
killed
under
him
and
he
narrowly
escaped
horry
was
dismounted
in
the
encounter
in
what
manner
we
are
not
told
and
would
have
been
cut
down
by
a
british
sergeant
but
for
his
wearing
a
uniform
that
resembled
that
of
a
british
colonel
he
was
helped
to
a
horse
at
a
most
fortunate
moment
he
did
not
know
in
consequence
of
the
blunder
of
clarke
that
the
dragoons
whom
he
had
fought
and
beaten
were
only
an
advanced
guard
of
a
body
of
infantry
horses
and
men
were
in
his
hands
and
dividing
his
force
he
sent
off
one
party
of
his
men
in
charge
of
the
prisoners
and
trophies
a
sudden
attack
of
the
british
infantry
took
the
small
party
which
remained
with
him
totally
by
surprise
they
broke
and
left
him
almost
alone
with
nothing
but
his
small
sword
in
his
hand
it
was
at
this
moment
that
a
brave
fellow
of
the
second
regiment
named
mcdonald
yielded
his
own
pony
to
his
commander
by
which
he
escaped
mcdonald
saved
himself
by
darting
into
the
neighboring
swamp
the
british
dreading
an
ambuscade
did
not
pursue
and
horry
rallied
his
men
and
returned
with
a
reinforcement
sent
by
marion
to
the
scene
of
battle
but
the
enemy
had
left
it
and
retired
to
georgetown
horry
proceeded
to
sand
hill
where
finding
himself
in
good
quarters
among
some
rich
and
friendly
whigs
living
well
on
their
supplies
he
proceeded
to
entrench
himself
in
a
regular
redoubt
but
from
this
imposing
situation
marion
soon
and
sensibly
recalled
him
he
wrote
me
says
horry
that
the
open
field
was
our
play
that
the
enemy
knew
better
how
to
defend
forts
and
entrenched
places
than
we
did
and
that
if
we
attempted
it
we
should
soon
fall
into
their
hands
marion
farther
instructions
were
to
join
him
immediately
with
every
man
that
he
could
bring
for
that
it
was
his
purpose
to
attack
the
enemy
as
soon
as
possible
horry
admits
that
he
quitted
his
redoubt
and
good
fare
very
reluctantly
he
set
out
with
eighty
men
but
when
he
joined
his
commander
in
lynch
creek
swamp
they
were
reduced
to
eighteen
it
seems
that
his
force
had
been
made
up
in
part
of
new
recruits
who
had
but
lately
joined
themselves
to
marion
horry
calls
them
wild
tories
or
new
whigs
volunteers
assuredly
not
to
fight
but
plunder
who
would
run
at
the
sight
of
the
enemy
his
recent
surprise
and
danger
had
rendered
the
colonel
sore
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
as
we
have
already
related
he
was
nearly
drowned
and
only
saved
by
clinging
to
the
impending
branches
of
a
tree
while
horry
was
skirmishing
with
campbell
major
john
postelle
who
was
stationed
to
guard
the
lower
part
of
the
pedee
succeeded
in
capturing
captain
depeyster
with
grenadiers
depeyster
had
taken
post
in
the
of
postelle
father
the
latter
had
with
him
but
militia
but
he
knew
the
grounds
and
gaining
possession
of
the
kitchen
fired
it
and
was
preparing
to
burn
the
house
also
when
depeyster
submitted
we
find
at
this
time
a
correspondence
of
marion
with
two
of
the
british
officers
in
relation
to
the
detention
as
a
prisoner
of
captain
postelle
who
it
seems
though
bearing
a
flag
was
detained
for
trial
by
the
enemy
portions
of
these
letters
in
which
marion
asserts
his
own
humanity
in
the
treatment
of
prisoners
we
quote
as
exhibiting
his
own
sense
at
least
of
what
was
the
true
character
of
his
conduct
in
such
matters
the
reader
will
not
have
forgotten
the
charges
made
against
him
in
this
respect
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
volume
by
balfour
in
a
letter
to
general
moultrie
one
of
the
present
letters
of
marion
is
addressed
to
balfour
i
am
sorry
to
complain
of
the
ill
treatment
my
officers
and
men
meet
with
from
captain
saunders
the
officers
are
closely
confined
in
a
small
place
where
they
can
neither
stand
nor
lie
at
length
nor
have
they
more
than
half
rations
i
have
treated
your
officers
and
men
who
have
fallen
into
my
hands
in
a
different
manner
should
these
evils
not
be
prevented
in
future
it
will
not
be
in
my
power
to
prevent
retaliation
lord
rawdon
and
watson
have
hanged
three
men
of
my
brigade
for
supposed
crimes
which
will
make
as
many
of
your
men
in
my
hands
suffer
again
on
the
same
subject
in
a
letter
to
watson
the
hanging
of
prisoners
and
the
violation
of
my
flag
will
be
retaliated
if
a
stop
is
not
put
to
such
proceedings
which
are
disgraceful
to
all
civilized
nations
all
of
your
officers
and
men
who
have
fallen
into
my
hands
have
been
treated
with
humanity
and
tenderness
and
i
wish
sincerely
that
i
may
not
be
obliged
to
act
contrary
to
my
inclination
the
british
officers
thus
addressed
alleged
against
postelle
that
he
had
broken
his
parole
if
this
were
so
it
was
a
just
cause
of
detention
but
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
british
themselves
revoked
these
paroles
on
the
assumption
that
the
province
was
conquered
and
when
as
citizens
they
wished
to
exact
military
service
from
the
people
in
these
circumstances
the
virtue
of
the
obligation
was
lost
and
ceased
on
the
part
of
the
citizen
because
of
the
violation
on
the
part
of
the
conqueror
of
the
immunities
which
he
promised
marion
took
decisive
measures
for
compelling
the
necessary
respect
to
his
flag
by
seizing
upon
captain
merritt
the
bearer
of
a
british
flag
and
putting
him
in
close
keeping
as
a
security
for
postelle
we
do
not
know
that
he
retaliated
upon
the
british
soldiers
the
cruel
murders
by
hanging
which
had
been
practised
upon
his
own
his
nature
would
probably
recoil
from
carrying
his
own
threat
into
execution
in
answer
to
one
of
marion
reproaches
we
are
told
by
watson
that
the
burning
of
houses
and
the
property
of
the
inhabitants
who
are
our
enemies
is
customary
in
all

merits
cornwallis
pursued
greene
into
north
carolina
and
after
much
manoeuvering
between
the
armies
they
met
at
guilford
on
the
of
march
the
honors
of
the
victory
small
as
it
was
lay
with
the
british
their
loss
however
was
such
that
the
advantages
of
the
field
enured
to
the
americans
from
this
field
cornwallis
took
his
way
to
virginia
and
his
career
as
a
commander
in
america
was
finally
arrested
at
the
siege
of
york
during
the
absence
of
greene
from
south
carolina
marion
was
the
only
force
in
active
operation
against
the
british
an
opportunity
so
favorable
for
harassing
and
distressing
the
enemy
as
that
afforded
by
the
absence
of
their
main
army
in
north
carolina
was
not
neglected
and
calling
in
his
detachments
he
once
more
carried
dismay
into
the
heart
of
the
tory
settlements
on
both
sides
of
the
santee
his
incursions
and
those
of
his
officers
were
extended
as
far
as
the
confluence
of
the
congaree
and
wateree
and
as
low
down
as
corner
thus
breaking
up
the
line
of
communication
between
charleston
and
the
grand
army
and
intercepting
detachments
and
supplies
sent
from
that
place
to
the
line
of
posts
established
through
the
country
this
sort
of
warfare
which
seldom
reaches
events
such
as
those
which
mark
epochs
in
the
progress
of
great
bodies
of
men
is
yet
one
which
calls
for
constant
activity
we
have
details
of
but
few
of
the
numerous
conflicts
which
took
place
between
our
partisan
and
the
tory
leaders
these
were
scattered
over
the
country
living
by
plunder
and
indulging
in
every
species
of
ferocity
greene
writes
the
whigs
and
tories
are
continually
out
in
small
parties
and
all
the
middle
country
is
so
disaffected
that
you
can
not
lay
in
the
most
trifling
magazine
or
send
a
wagon
through
the
country
with
the
least
article
of
stores
without
a
guard
in
addressing
himself
to
this
sort
of
warfare
marion
was
pursuing
a
course
of
the
largest
benefit
to
the
country
in
overawing
these
plunderers
subduing
the
savage
spirit
and
confining
the
british
to
their
strong
places
he
was
acquiring
an
importance
which
if
we
are
to
estimate
the
merits
of
a
leader
only
by
the
magnitude
of
his
victories
will
leave
us
wholly
at
a
loss
to
know
by
what
means
his
great
reputation
was
acquired
but
the
value
of
his
services
is
best
gathered
from
the
effect
which
they
had
upon
the
enemy
the
insults
and
vexations
which
he
unceasingly
occasioned
to
the
british
were
not
to
be
borne
and
watson
was
dispatched
with
a
select
force
of
five
hundred
men
to
hunt
him
up
and
destroy
him
we
have
seen
tarleton
and
others
engaged
in
the
pursuit
but
without
success
watson
was
destined
to
be
less
fortunate
in
the
meanwhile
and
before
watson
came
upon
his
trail
peter
horry
had
been
engaged
in
a
series
of
petty
but
rather
amusing
skirmishes
in
the
neighborhood
of
georgetown
a
party
of
the
british
were
engaged
in
killing
beeves
at
white
bridge
near
georgetown
horry
men
charged
them
while
at
this
employment
and
killing
some
pursued
the
rest
towards
that
place
the
firing
was
heard
in
the
town
and
the
facts
of
the
case
conjectured
this
brought
out
a
reinforcement
before
which
the
detachment
of
horry
was
compelled
to
retreat
but
on
gaining
the
woods
they
were
joined
also
by
their
friends
and
the
fight
was
resumed
between
the
sampit
and
black
river
roads
with
a
dogged
fierceness
on
both
sides
that
made
it
particularly
bloody
in
the
course
of
the
struggle
horry
at
one
moment
found
himself
alone
his
men
were
more
or
less
individually
engaged
and
scattered
through
the
woods
around
him
his
only
weapon
was
his
small
sword
in
this
situation
he
was
suddenly
assailed
by
a
tory
captain
named
lewis
at
the
head
of
a
small
party
lewis
was
armed
with
a
musket
and
in
the
act
of
firing
when
a
sudden
shot
from
the
woods
tumbled
him
from
his
horse
in
the
very
moment
when
his
own
gun
was
discharged
the
bullet
of
lewis
took
effect
on
horry
horse
the
shot
which
so
seasonably
slew
the
tory
had
been
sent
by
the
hands
of
a
boy
named
gwin
the
party
of
lewis
apprehending
an
ambush
immediately
fell
back
and
put
themselves
in
cover
the
conflict
lasted
through
the
better
part
of
the
day
one
side
gaining
ground
and
now
the
other
it
closed
in
the
final
defeat
of
the
enemy
who
were
pursued
with
a
savage
and
unsparing
spirit
one
half
of
their
number
were
left
dead
upon
the
ground
their
leader
was
major
gainey
great
expectations
were
formed
of
his
ability
to
cope
with
marion
on
this
occasion
though
he
made
his
escape
his
mode
of
doing
so
was
characterized
by
a
peculiar
circumstance
which
rendered
it
particularly
amusing
to
one
side
and
annoying
to
the
other
he
was
singled
out
in
the
chase
by
sergeant
mcdonald
a
fierce
young
fellow
who
was
admirably
mounted
gainey
was
fortunate
in
being
well
mounted
also
mcdonald
regarding
but
the
one
enemy
passed
all
others
he
himself
said
that
he
could
have
slain
several
in
the
chase
but
he
wished
for
no
meaner
object
than
their
leader
one
man
alone
who
threw
himself
in
the
way
of
the
pursuit
became
its
victim
him
he
shot
down
and
as
they
went
at
full
speed
down
the
black
river
road
at
the
corner
of
richmond
fence
the
sergeant
had
gained
so
far
upon
his
enemy
as
to
be
able
to
plunge
his
bayonet
into
his
back
the
steel
separated
from
his
gun
and
with
no
time
to
extricate
it
gainey
rushed
into
georgetown
with
the
weapon
still
conspicuously
showing
how
close
and
eager
had
been
the
chase
and
how
narrow
the
escape
the
wound
was
not
fatal
the
next
affair
was
with
tynes
who
had
been
defeated
by
marion
some
time
before
made
prisoner
and
sent
to
north
carolina
but
the
north
carolina
jailors
seem
to
have
been
pretty
generally
tories
for
we
find
horry
complaining
that
they
discharged
the
prisoners
quite
as
fast
as
they
were
sent
there
and
it
was
the
complaint
of
some
of
officers
that
they
had
to
fight
the
same
persons
in
some
instances
not
less
than
three
or
four
times
tynes
had
collected
a
second
force
and
penetrating
the
forests
of
black
river
was
approaching
the
camp
of
our
partisan
marion
went
against
him
fell
upon
him
suddenly
completely
routed
him
taking
himself
and
almost
his
whole
party
prisoners
he
made
his
escape
a
second
time
from
north
carolina
and
with
a
third
and
larger
force
than
ever
reappeared
in
the
neighborhood
of
marion
camp
horry
was
sent
against
him
with
forty
chosen
horsemen
he
travelled
all
night
and
stopped
the
next
day
at
the
house
of
a
tory
where
he
obtained
refreshments
his
men
succeeded
in
obtaining
something
more
the
tory
most
liberally
filled
their
canteens
with
and
when
the
colonel
got
within
striking
distance
of
tynes
and
his
tories
scarcely
one
of
his
troops
was
fit
for
action
he
prudently
retreated
very
much
mortified
with
the
transaction
marion
captured
a
part
of
tynes
force
a
few
days
after
and
this
luckless
loyalist
seems
to
have
disappeared
from
the
field
from
that
moment
watson
march
against
marion
was
conducted
with
great
caution
the
operations
of
the
partisan
meanwhile
were
continued
without
interruption
about
the
middle
of
february
he
was
apprised
of
the
march
of
major
mcilraith
from
nelson
ferry
at
the
head
of
a
force
fully
equal
to
his
own
this
british
officer
seems
to
have
been
singularly
unlike
his
brethren
in
some
remarkable
particulars
he
took
no
pleasure
in
burning
houses
the
hospitality
of
which
he
had
enjoyed
he
destroyed
no
cattle
wantonly
and
hung
no
unhappy
prisoner
the
story
goes
that
while
marion
was
pressing
upon
the
steps
of
the
enemy
he
paused
at
the
house
of
a
venerable
lady
who
had
been
always
a
friend
to
the
whigs
and
who
now
declared
her
unhappiness
at
seeing
him
her
reason
being
asked
she
declared
that
she
conjectured
his
purpose
that
he
was
pursuing
mcilraith
and
that
so
honorable
and
gentle
had
been
the
conduct
of
that
officer
on
his
march
that
she
was
really
quite
unwilling
that
he
should
suffer
harm
though
an
enemy
what
he
heard
did
not
impair
marion
activity
but
it
tended
somewhat
to
subdue
those
fiercer
feelings
which
ordinarily
governed
the
partisans
in
that
sanguinary
warfare
he
encountered
and
assailed
mcilraith
on
the
road
near
swamp
first
cutting
off
two
picquets
in
his
rear
in
succession
then
wheeling
round
his
main
body
attacked
him
at
the
same
moment
in
flank
and
front
mcilraith
was
without
cavalry
and
his
situation
was
perilous
in
the
extreme
but
he
was
a
brave
fellow
and
marion
had
few
bayonets
by
forced
marches
and
constant
skirmishing
the
british
major
gained
an
open
field
upon
the
road
he
posted
himself
within
the
enclosure
upon
the
west
of
the
road
marion
pitched
his
camp
on
the
edge
of
a
large
cypress
pond
which
lay
on
the
east
and
closely
skirted
the
highway
here
mcilraith
sent
him
a
flag
reproaching
him
with
shooting
his
picquets
contrary
as
he
alleged
to
all
the
laws
of
civilized
warfare
and
concluded
with
defying
him
to
combat
in
the
open
field
the
arguments
of
military
men
on
the
subject
of
the
laws
of
civilized
warfare
are
sometimes
equally
absurd
and
impertinent
warfare
itself
is
against
all
the
laws
of
civilisation
and
there
is
something
ludicrous
in
the
stronger
reproaching
the
feebler
power
that
it
should
resort
to
such
means
as
are
in
its
possession
for
reconciling
the
inequalities
of
force
between
them
marion
reply
to
mcilraith
was
sufficiently
to
the
purpose
he
said
that
the
practice
of
the
british
in
burning
the
property
of
those
who
would
not
submit
and
join
them
was
much
more
indefensible
than
that
of
shooting
picquets
and
that
while
they
persisted
in
the
one
practice
he
should
certainly
persevere
in
the
other
as
to
the
challenge
of
mcilraith
he
said
that
he
considered
it
that
of
a
man
whose
condition
was
desperate
but
concluded
with
saying
that
if
he
mcilraith
wished
to
witness
a
combat
between
twenty
picked
soldiers
on
each
side
he
was
not
unwilling
to
gratify
him
here
was
a
proposal
that
savored
something
of
chivalry
mcilraith
agreed
to
the
suggestion
and
an
arrangement
was
made
for
a
meeting
the
place
chosen
for
the
combat
was
in
a
part
of
a
field
which
is
very
well
known
south
of
an
old
oak
tree
which
was
still
up
to
the
year
pointed
out
to
the
stranger
it
may
be
standing
to
this
day
for
the
oak
outlasts
many
generations
of
brave
men
marion
chose
for
the
leader
of
his
band
major
john
vanderhorst
then
a
supernumerary
officer
in
his
brigade
the
second
in
command
was
capt
samuel
price
of
all
saints
the
names
of
the
men
were
written
on
slips
of
paper
and
handed
to
them
severally
gavin
witherspoon
received
the
first
the
names
of
the
others
are
not
preserved
not
one
of
them
refused
when
they
were
separated
from
their
comrades
they
were
paraded
near
the
fence
and
marion
addressed
them
in
the
following
language
my
brave
soldiers
you
are
twenty
men
picked
this
day
out
of
my
whole
brigade
i
know
you
all
and
have
often
witnessed
your
bravery
in
the
name
of
your
country
i
call
upon
you
once
more
to
show
it
my
confidence
in
you
is
great
i
am
sure
it
will
not
be
disappointed
fight
like
men
as
you
have
always
done
and
you
are
sure
of
the
victory
the
speech
was
short
but
it
was
effectual
it
was
perhaps
a
long
one
for
marion
his
words
were
usually
few
but
they
were
always
to
the
purpose
more
words
were
unnecessary
here
the
combatants
heard
him
with
pride
and
hailed
his
exhortations
with
applause
while
their
cheers
were
loudest
marion
transferred
them
to
their
leader
vanderhorst
now
asked
witherspoon
at
what
distance
he
would
prefer
as
the
most
sure
to
strike
with
buckshot
fifty
yards
for
the
first
fire
was
the
answer
then
said
vanderhorst
when
we
get
within
fifty
yards
as
i
am
not
a
good
judge
of
distances
witherspoon
will
tap
me
on
the
shoulder
i
will
then
give
the
word
my
lads
and
you
will
form
on
my
left
opposite
these
fellows
as
you
form
each
man
will
fire
at
the
one
directly
opposite
and
my
word
for
it
few
will
need
a
second
shot
nothing
indeed
was
more
certain
than
this
and
how
mcilraith
proposed
to
fight
with
any
hope
of
the
result
knowing
how
deadly
was
the
aim
of
the
americans
is
beyond
conjecture
if
he
relied
upon
the
bayonet
as
perhaps
he
did
his
hope
must
have
rested
only
upon
those
who
survived
the
first
fire
and
with
these
it
was
only
necessary
for
the
americans
to
practise
the
game
of
the
survivor
of
the
horatii
in
order
to
gain
as
complete
a
victory
they
had
but
to
scatter
and
change
their
ground
avoid
the
push
of
the
bayonet
till
they
could
secure
a
second
shot
and
that
certainly
would
have
finished
the
business
but
mcilraith
had
already
reconsidered
the
proceeding
his
men
were
formed
in
a
straight
line
in
front
of
the
oak
vanderhorst
was
advancing
and
had
got
within
one
hundred
yards
when
a
british
officer
was
seen
to
pass
hurriedly
to
the
detachment
and
the
next
moment
the
men
retreated
with
a
quick
step
towards
the
main
body
vanderhorst
and
his
party
gave
three
huzzas
but
not
a
shot
was
fired
mcilraith
committed
two
errors
he
should
not
have
made
the
arrangement
but
once
made
he
should
have
suffered
it
to
go
on
at
all
hazards
the
effect
was
discreditable
to
himself
and
detrimental
to
the
efficiency
of
his
men
marion
would
have
fought
his
enemy
all
day
on
the
same
terms
his
followers
were
on
their
own
ground
with
a
familiar
weapon
while
the
soldiers
of
the
british
were
deprived
of
all
their
usual
advantages
the
assurance
of
support
after
the
fire
of
the
enemy
was
drawn
the
militia
seldom
stood
the
encounter
of
the
bayonet
but
they
as
seldom
failed
to
do
famous
execution
with
the
first
two
or
three
discharges
that
night
mcilraith
abandoned
his
heavy
baggage
left
fires
burning
and
retreating
silently
from
the
ground
hurried
with
all
dispatch
along
the
river
road
towards
singleton
mills
distant
ten
miles
marion
discovered
the
retreat
before
daylight
and
sent
hugh
horry
forward
with
one
hundred
men
to
get
in
advance
of
him
before
he
should
reach
the
mill
but
horry
soon
found
this
to
be
impossible
and
he
detached
major
james
at
the
head
of
a
select
party
well
mounted
on
the
swiftest
horses
with
instructions
to
cross
the
above
and
take
possession
of
singleton
houses
these
standing
on
a
high
hill
commanded
a
narrow
defile
on
the
road
between
the
hill
and
the
wateree
swamp
james
reached
the
house
as
the
british
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
but
here
he
found
a
new
enemy
which
his
foresters
dreaded
much
more
than
the
british
or
tories
the
family
were
down
with
it
and
james
shrank
from
availing
himself
of
any
advantage
offered
by
the
situation
but
before
he
retired
one
of
his
men
resting
his
rifle
against
a
tree
shot
the
commander
of
the
british
advance
he
was
mortally
wounded
and
died
the
next
day
marion
was
displeased
with
this
achievement
the
forbearance
of
mcilraith
while
passing
through
the
country
had
touched
his
heart
he
withdrew
his
forces
not
displeased
that
his
enemy
had
secured
a
stronghold
in
singleton
mill
the
conscientiousness
of
the
british
officer
is
said
to
have
incurred
the
displeasure
of
his
commander
and
that
of
his
brother
officers
when
he
reached
charleston
he
was

to
his
gratuitous
humanity
his
reluctance
to
burn
and

with
such
excellent
examples
before
him
as
cornwallis

we
rather
suspect
however
that
it
was
in
consequence
of
the
unfortunate
issue
of
the
pitched
battle

agreed
upon
between

and

his

the
preparations
of

for
pursuing

destroying
our

in
his
stronghold
were
at
length
complete
he
sallied
forth
from
fort
watson
about
the
first
of
march
and
with
a
british
regiment
and
a
large
body
of
loyalists
a
force
quite
sufficient
as
was
thought
for
the
desired
object
marched
down
the
santee
shaping
his
course
for
snow

at
the

time
doyle
at

of

british
regiment

for

was
directed
to
proceed
by
way
of
ferry
on
lynch
and
down
jeffers
creek
to
the
pedee
here
they
were
to
form
a
junction
marion
had
no
force
to
meet
these
enemies
in
open
combat
his
number
did
not
much
exceed
three
hundred
but
he
had
other
resources
of
his
own
which
better
served
to
equalize
them
doyle
approach
was
slow
and
it
seems
partially
unsuspected
in
fact
in
order
to
meet
his
enemies
and
make
the
most
of
his
strength
marion
had
generally
called
in
his
scouting
parties
of
watson
movements
he
had
ample
information
his
scouts
well
provided
with
relays
of
horses
traversed
the
country
between
his
camp
and
camden
advised
correctly
of
watson
progress
he
made
one
of
those
rapid
marches
for
which
he
was
famous
and
met
him
at
wiboo
swamp
about
midway
between
nelson
and
murray
ferries
at
this
place
commenced
a
conflict
as
remarkable
as
it
was
protracted
the
advance
of
watson
consisted
of
the
tory
horse
under
richboo
peter
horry
led
marion
advance
consisting
of
about
thirty
men
the
remainder
of
the
brigade
lay
in
reserve
the
encounter
of
the
two
advanced
parties
produced
a
mutual
panic
both
recoiling
upon
their
main
bodies
but
that
of
horry
was
the
first
to
recover
and
the
command
to
charge
given
by
marion
himself
produced
the
desired
effect
horry
was
at
length
driven
back
by
watson
regulars
and
the
which
finally
dislodged
him
they
were
pursued
by
the
tory
horse
of
harrison
which
pressing
upon
the
main
body
gained
some
advantages
and
in
the
uncertainty
of
the
event
while
there
was
some
confusion
afforded
an
opportunity
for
several
instances
of
great
individual
valor
as
the
column
of
harrison
pressed
over
the
causeway
which
was
narrow
gavin
james
a
private
of
great
spirit
and
gigantic
size
mounted
on
a
strong
grey
horse
and
armed
with
musket
and
bayonet
threw
himself
in
advance
of
his
comrades
and
directly
in
the
path
of
the
enemy
taking
deliberate
aim
he
fired
his
piece
dropped
his
man
and
drew
a
volley
from
those
in
front
of
him
not
a
shot
of
which
took
effect
his
determined
position
and
presence
in
the
centre
of
the
narrow
causeway
produced
a
pause
in
the
advance
a
dragoon
rushed
upon
him
and
was
stricken
down
by
the
bayonet
a
second
coming
to
the
assistance
of
his
comrade
shared
the
same
fate
but
in
falling
laid
hold
of
the
muzzle
of
james
musket
and
was
dragged
by
him
in
the
retreat
some
forty
or
fifty
paces
this
heroism
was
not
without
its
effect
if
the
men
of
marion
faltered
for
a
moment
such
examples
and
the
voice
of
their
general
their
courage
capts
macauley
and
conyers
at
the
head
of
the
cavalry
arrested
the
advance
of
the
tories
and
harrison
himself
fell
mortally
wounded
by
the
hands
of
conyers
the
tories
were
dispersed
and
sought
shelter
from
the
infantry
of
watson
before
the
advance
of
which
marion
deemed
it
prudent
for
the
time
to
retire
marion
lost
nothing
by
this
meeting
its
effect
upon
the
tories
was
highly
beneficial
they
had
suffered
severely
in
killed
and
wounded
and
were
thus
intimidated
at
the
outset
watson
encamped
that
night
on
the
field
of
battle
and
marion
a
few
miles
below
the
next
morning
the
pursuit
was
resumed
watson
marched
down
the
river
marion
keeping
just
sufficiently
ahead
of
him
to
be
able
to
post
an
ambuscade
for
him
at
the
first
point
that
seemed
suitable
for
such
a
purpose
at
mount
hope
watson
had
to
build
up
the
bridges
and
sustain
a
second
conflict
with
a
chosen
party
of
marion
led
by
hugh
horry
by
bringing
forward
his
and
drilling
the
swamp
thickets
with
grape
he
succeeded
in
expelling
horry
and
clearing
the
way
for
his
column
but
the
same
game
was
to
be
renewed
with
every
renewal
of
the
opportunity
when
watson
drew
near
to
murray
ferry
he
passed
the
kingstree
road
and
coming
to
that
of
black
river
which
crosses
at
the
lower
bridge
he
made
a
feint
of
still
continuing
along
the
santee
but
soon
after
wheeled
about
and
took
the
former
route
this
manoeuvre
might
have
deceived
a
less
wary
antagonist
than
marion
he
was
soon
aware
of
the
enemy
intention
detaching
major
james
at
the
head
of
seventy
men
thirty
of
whom
were
rifles
he
ordered
him
to
destroy
the
bridge
and
so
post
himself
as
to
command
it
he
himself
kept
his
eye
fixed
upon
watson
this
bridge
was
on
the
main
pass
to
williamsburg
and
the
men
chosen
for
its
defence
were
judiciously
taken
from
that
part
of
the
country
it
was
naturally
supposed
that
in
sight
of
their
cottage
smokes
they
would
struggle
manfully
against
the
enemy
forces
james
proceeded
with
great
rapidity
and
avoiding
the
road
crossed
the
river
by
a
shorter
route
he
reached
the
bridge
in
time
to
throw
down
two
of
the
middle
arches
and
to
fire
the
string
pieces
at
the
eastern
extremity
as
soon
as
the
chasm
was
made
he
placed
riflemen
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
and
on
each
side
of
the
ford
the
rest
of
his
detachment
were
so
stationed
as
to
cooperate
when
required
with
their
comrades
marion
arriving
soon
after
strengthened
the
force
of
james
with
the
pedee
company
under
captain
potts
and
took
post
himself
with
the
main
body
in
the
rear
these
arrangements
had
scarcely
been
effected
when
watson
made
his
appearance
at
this
place
the
west
bank
of
the
river
is
considerably
higher
than
the
east
the
latter
is
low
and
somewhat
swampy
on
the
west
the
road
passes
to
the
bridge
through
a
ravine
the
river
was
forty
or
fifty
yards
wide
and
though
deep
was
fordable
below
the
bridge
the
ravine
was
commanded
by
rifles
as
soon
as
watson
approached
the
river
which
he
did
from
the
west
his
opened
upon
the
passage
which
conducted
to
the
ford
but
the
position
assigned
to
marion
men
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
river
effectually
protected
them
to
bring
the
to
bear
upon
the
low
grounds
which
they
occupied
was
to
expose
the
artillerists
upon
the
elevated
banks
which
they
occupied
to
the
deliberate
and
fatal
fire
of
the
riflemen
watson
was
soon
made
aware
of
the
difficulties
of
the
passage
not
a
man
approached
within
that
did
not
pay
the
penalty
of
his
rashness
and
those
who
drew
nigh
to
succor
or
carry
off
the
wounded
shared
the
same
fate
it
was
determined
to
attempt
the
ford
and
the
advance
was
put
forward
as
a
forlorn
hope
with
this
desperate
purpose
the
officer
leading
it
came
on
very
gallantly
waving
his
sword
aloft
and
loudly
encouraging
his
men
his
progress
was
fatally
arrested
by
rifle
the
signal
drew
the
fire
of
the
riflemen
and
musketeers
with
whom
the
banks
were
lined
and
the
heavy
and
deliberate
discharge
drove
back
and
dispersed
the
british
advance
nor
did
the
reserve
move
forward
to
its
assistance
four
brave
fellows
attempted
to
carry
off
the
officer
who
had
fallen
but
they
remained
with
him
watson
was
terrified
he
was
heard
to
say
that
he
had
never
seen
such
shooting
in
his
life
there
was
no
effecting
the
passage
in
the
face
of
such
enemies
and
stealing
down
to
the
banks
of
the
river
on
the
side
which
they
occupied
and
wherever
the
woods
afforded
shelter
the
british
skirmished
with
marion
flankers
across
the
stream
until
night
put
an
end
to
the
conflict
the
next
morning
watson
sent
that
dispatch
to
marion
which
from
its
lugubrious
tenor
has
acquired
a
degree
of
notoriety
much
greater
than
the
name
of
the
officer
from
whom
it
emanated
he
complained
to
marion
of
his
modes
of
fighting
objected
to
the
ambuscades
of
the
partisan
and
particularly
complained
that
his
picquets
and
sentinels
should
be
shot
down
when
they
had
no
suspicion
of
danger
he
concluded
by
urging
upon
marion
to
come
out
and
fight
him
like
a
gentleman
and
christian
according
to
the
laws
of
civilized
warfare
while
the
tone
of
the
letter
was
thus
lugubrious
its
language
was
offensive
he
applied
to
the
partisans
the
epithets
banditti
and
murderers
marion
returned
no
answer
to
this
precious
document
but
renewed
his
order
to
his
nightly
patrols
to
shoot
the
sentinels
and
cut
off
the
picquets
as
before
he
thought
the
measure
quite
as
legitimate
in
such
a
war
as
the
burning
the
house
and
hanging
the
son
of
the
widow
but
though
marion
returned
no
answer
by
the
flag
to
the
letter
of
watson
there
was
a
dispatch
by
one
of
the
brigade
of
a
somewhat
curious
character
there
was
a
sergeant
in
the
brigade
by
the
name
of
mcdonald
of
whom
something
has
been
heard
before
he
was
the
same
bold
fellow
who
had
so
closely
pursued
major
gainey
into
georgetown
leaving
his
bayonet
in
the
possession
and
person
of
the
latter
he
was
distinguished
by
his
great
coolness
and
courage
an
extraordinary
degree
of
strength
and
a
corresponding
share
of
agility
he
was
as
notorious
among
the
enemy
for
his
audacity
as
he
was
among
his
comrades
for
his
great
modesty
and
goodness
of
heart
it
appears
that
among
some
of
watson
captures
while
pressing
hard
upon
our
partisans
had
been
the
entire
wardrobe
of
mcdonald
the
sergeant
felt
it
as
something
more
than
a
loss
of
property
that
his
clothes
should
be
taken
by
the
enemy
it
was
a
point
of
honor
that
he
should
recover
them
his
message
to
watson
was
of
this
purport
he
concluded
with
solemnly
assuring
the
bearer
of
the
flag
that
if
the
clothes
were
not
returned
he
would
kill
eight
of
his
men
watson
was
furious
at
a
message
which
increased
the
irritation
of
his
late
discomfiture
knowing
nothing
himself
of
mcdonald
he
was
disposed
to
treat
the
message
with
contempt
but
some
of
his
officers
who
knew
better
the
person
with
whom
they
had
to
deal
begged
that
the
clothes
of
the
sergeant
might
be
returned
to
him
for
that
he
would
most
certainly
keep
his
word
if
they
were
not
watson
complied
with
the
suggestion
when
the
clothes
appeared
mcdonald
said
to
the
bearer
tell
watson
i
will
now
kill
but
four
of
his
men
two
days
after
he
shot
lieut
torriano
through
the
knee
with
a
rifle
at
a
distance
of
three
hundred
yards
marion
the
next
day
took
post
on
a
ridge
below
the
ford
of
the
river
which
is
still
popularly
called
the
general
island
his
rifles
still
effectually
commanded
the
passage
and
baffled
every
attempt
of
watson
to
cross
pushing
and
conyers
over
the
river
they
exercised
themselves
in
cutting
off
his
patrols
and
picquets
to
save
himself
from
these
annoyances
watson
retreated
a
little
higher
up
the
river
and
pitched
his
camp
at
blakeley
plantation
in
the
most
open
field
that
he
could
find
here
he
remained
for
ten
days
almost
environed
by
his
adroit
and
active
enemy
night
and
day
was
he
kept
in
a
condition
of
alarm
and
apprehension
the
cavalry
beat
up
his
quarters
when
he
slept
while
the
riflemen
picked
off
his
men
the
moment
they
exposed
themselves
it
was
while
he
was
in
this
situation
that
the
brave
capt
conyers
presented
himself
daily
before
the
lines
of
the
enemy
either
as
a
single
cavalier
or
at
the
head
of
his
troop
demanding
an
opponent
the
anecdote
has
been
already
narrated
in
another
chapter
the
temper
of
watson
was
very
much
subdued
by
this
sort
of
warfare
his
next
letter
to
marion
was
of
very
different
tone
from
that
sent
but
a
few
days
before
he
now
solicits
a
pass
from
his
enemy
for
lieut
torriano
and
others
wounded
whom
he
desired
to
send
to
charleston
this
was
promptly
granted
meanwhile
he
employed
a
negro
from
plantation
to
carry
a
letter
to
the
commandant
at
georgetown
in
endeavoring
to
make
his
way
the
negro
was
killed
and
the
letter
fell
into
the
hands
of
marion
it
contained
a
woful
complaint
of
the
unfair
mode
of
fighting
pursued
by
the
partisans
and
implored
a
reinforcement
in
fact
watson
was
literally
besieged
his
supplies
were
cut
off
his
progress
arrested
and
so
many
of
his
men
perished
in
the
continual
skirmishing
that
he
is
reported
by
tradition
to
have
sunk
them
in
black
river
in
order
to
conceal
their
numbers
he
was
finally
compelled
to
decamp
if
his
path
was
beset
with
dangers
it
was
death
to
remain
in
his
present
situation
making
a
forced
march
down
the
georgetown
road
he
paused
when
he
reached
ox
swamp
six
miles
below
the
lower
bridge
his
flight
had
been
harassed
by
light
parties
of
the
americans
but
here
he
found
them
prepared
for
and
awaiting
him
the
road
through
which
he
was
to
pass
was
skirted
by
a
thick
boggy
swamp
and
before
him
the
causeway
was
covered
with
trees
which
had
been
felled
to
obstruct
his
passage
the
bridges
were
destroyed
and
marion
lay
directly
in
his
path
prepared
for
a
final
encounter
watson
shrunk
from
the
prospect
and
determined
upon
another
route
wheeling
to
the
right
he
dashed
through
the
open
pine
woods
for
the
santee
road
about
fifteen
miles
when
overtaken
by
marion
upon
this
road
his
infantry
were
hurrying
forward
like
horses
at
a
full
trot
but
few
natural
obstacles
attended
his
progress
on
this
path
and
the
extraordinary
rapidity
of
his
flight
had
put
him
considerably
ahead
of
his
pursuers
but
he
was
not
yet
to
escape
the
cavalry
of
horry
and
the
riflemen
of
galled
him
at
every
step
in
flank
and
rear
when
he
reached
sampit
bridge
a
last
skirmish
took
place
which
might
have
terminated
in
the
complete
defeat
of
the
enemy
but
for
the
cowardice
of
a
lieut
scott
of
horry
detachment
watson
was
attacked
fiercely
in
the
flank
and
rear
by
the
whole
force
of
marion
his
horse
was
killed
and
his
own
life
endangered
the
affair
was
equally
short
and
sharp
and
had
it
not
been
that
the
ambush
placed
by
horry
failed
to
discharge
its
duty
watson
would
in
all
probability
never
have
reached
georgetown
or
only
reached
it
on
parole
he
gained
it
finally
in
safety
thoroughly
harassed
and
discomfited
by
the
subtle
enemy
whom
he
had
gone
forth
with
a
superior
force
and
a
confident
hope
to
destroy
or
capture
horry
but
the
success
of
our
partisan
against
watson
did
not
necessarily
dispose
of
his
enemies
while
he
had
been
engaged
in
the
events
as
just
given
doyle
had
succeeded
in
penetrating
to
his
haunts
on
island
that
famous
retreat
had
been
entrusted
to
a
small
body
of
men
under
the
command
of
ervin
ervin
was
defeated
and
doyle
obtained
possession
of
all
marion
stores
arms
and
ammunition
were
emptied
into
lynch
creek
and
this
at
a
period
when
every
ounce
of
powder
and
pound
of
shot
were
worth
to
our
partisans
their
weight
in
gold
it
was
while
moving
from
sampit
towards
snow
island
that
marion
was
apprised
of
this
mortifying
intelligence
it
was
a
matter
to
be
deplored
certainly
but
it
was
one
of
those
events
that
could
not
have
been
prevented
the
force
of
marion
was
too
small
to
suffer
him
to
play
the
admirable
game
already
described
with
watson
yet
leave
a
sufficient
body
of
men
in
camp
for
its
protection
he
had
only
to
console
himself
by
taking
his
revenge
and
he
turned
the
head
of
his
columns
in
pursuit
of
doyle
this
officer
made
his
way
to
witherspoon
ferry
on
creek
where
he
lay
in
a
good
position
on
the
north
side
of
the
ferry
marion
approached
him
cautiously
with
mounted
riflemen
in
advance
arriving
at
the
creek
a
detachment
of
the
british
was
found
on
the
opposite
side
engaged
in
scuttling
the
ferry
boat
the
riflemen
drew
nigh
unperceived
and
poured
in
a
well
directed
and
deadly
fire
which
produced
the
utmost
consternation
the
fire
was
returned
in
volleys
but
the
limbs
and
branches
of
the
trees
suffered
infinitely
more
than
the
riflemen
who
lay
behind
them
marion
now
made
his
arrangements
for
crossing
the
stream
but
this
was
not
to
be
done
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
with
the
creek
before
him
wide
and
swollen
marion
moved
rapidly
up
the
creek
which
he
swam
at
the
first
favorable
point
some
five
miles
above
witherspoon
this
brought
him
nearer
to
position
but
the
latter
had
not
waited
for
him
whether
it
was
that
he
had
little
taste
for
the
sort
of
annoyances
to
which
watson
had
been
subjected
or
that
he
had
received
instructions
from
lord
rawdon
to
join
him
at
camden
in
all
haste
it
is
certain
that
he
made
the
greatest
speed
in
hurrying
in
that
direction
it
was
at
this
period
that
marion
held
a
consultation
with
horry
in
which
he
is
represented
by
that
officer
as
in
an
unusual
state
of
despondency
his
enemies
were
accumulating
around
him
with
unwonted
rapidity
and
in
greater
force
than
ever
watson
furious
at
his
late
disasters
and
mortified
with
the
result
of
his
confident
anticipations
had
sallied
forth
from
georgetown
with
a
reinforcement
he
had
gone
towards
the
pedee
where
he
strengthened
himself
with
the
large
body
of
tories
which
gainey
had
commanded
horry
tells
us
of
a
third
body
of
men
at
the
same
time
in
the
field
with
doyle
and
watson
and
all
addressing
themselves
to
the
same
object
his
utter
expulsion
from
the
country
at
that
moment
the
expulsion
of
our
partisan
would
leave
the
conquest
of
the
state
complete
in
these
emergencies
with
these
foes
accumulating
around
him
the
mind
of
marion
naturally
addressed
itself
with
more
gravity
than
usual
to
the
task
of
his
extrication
from
his
enemies
his
countenance
as
horry
describes
it
was
troubled
but
with
his
usual
taciturnity
he
said
nothing
on
the
subject
of
his
anxieties
seeing
him
walking
alone
and
in
deep
revery
horry
approached
him
and
said
general
our
men
are
few
and
if
what
i
hear
be
true
you
never
wanted
them
more
marion
started
and
replied
go
immediately
to
the
field
officers
and
know
from
them
if
in
the
event
of
my
being
compelled
to
retire
to
the
mountains
they
will
follow
my
fortunes
and
with
me
carry
on
the
war
until
the
enemy
is
forced
out
of
the
country
go
and
bring
me
their
answer
without
delay
it
was
a
peculiarity
in
marion
character
that
he
should
have
entrusted
such
a
commission
to
a
subordinate
but
it
accords
with
all
that
we
have
seen
of
the
reserve
and
shyness
of
his
moods
the
simple
remark
to
horry
indicates
his
admirable
firmness
his
calculations
even
of
possible
necessities
long
in
advance
and
his
instinctive
mode
of
encountering
them
as
he
best
might
his
determination
on
his
own
account
to
carry
on
the
war
against
the
enemy
in
the
mountains
till
they
or
himself
were
expelled
from
the
country
denotes
the
unsubmitting
patriot
the
reader
must
not
forget
that
at
this
moment
there
was
no
force
in
the
state
but
his
own
arrayed
against
the
british
sumter
was
still
de
combat
from
his
wound
the
army
of
greene
having
with
it
pickens
and
other
native
militia
was
in
north
carolina
watching
the
movements
of
cornwallis
lord
rawdon
with
a
strong
british
garrison
held
camden
charleston
and
georgetown
and
granby
forts
watson
and
motte
were
all
held
with
numerous
other
conspicuous
points
by
the
british
and
with
watson
whose
force
now
numbered
a
thousand
men
doyle
half
that
number
and
several
active
and
large
bodies
of
tories
prepared
to
cooperate
with
these
against
our
partisan
the
danger
of
marion
situation
and
his
patriotic
resolve
of
character
are
conspicuous
at
a
glance
horry
sought
the
officers
and
promptly
returned
to
his
commander
to
a
man
they
had
pledged
themselves
to
follow
his
fortunes
however
disastrous
while
one
of
them
survived
and
until
their
country
was
freed
from
the
enemy
marion
countenance
instantly
brightened
we
can
not
forbear
the
use
of
horry
own
language
though
it
may
provoke
a
smile
he
was
he
rose
upon
his
toes
and
said
i
am
satisfied

marion
instantly
put
his
men
in
motion
in
pursuit
of
doyle
in
crossing
the
swamp
of
lynch
creek
during
the
night
several
of
the
soldiers
lost
their
arms
in
consequence
of
the
freshet
the
swamp
was
inundated
and
it
required
all
their
dexterity
and
promptitude
to
save
themselves
snatching
a
hasty
breakfast
the
pursuit
was
continued
all
day
and
resumed
the
next
morning
until
ten
when
they
found
such
signs
of
the
superior
speed
and
haste
of
the
enemy
as
to
preclude
all
possibility
of
overtaking
him
they
had
been
necessarily
delayed
by
the
passage
of
the
swamp
and
had
not
made
sufficient
allowance
for
the
speed
with
which
an
enemy
might
run
when
there
was
occasion
for
it
here
they
found
that
doyle
had
destroyed
all
his
heavy
baggage
and
had
sped
in
such
confusion
towards
camden
that
his
encampment
and
the
road
which
he
traversed
were
strewn
with
canteens
and
knapsacks
and
everything
not
necessary
to
defence
which
might
retard
his
progress
marion
somewhat
surprised
at
a
flight
for
which
he
could
not
then
account
for
his
own
force
was
far
inferior
to
that
of
doyle
yet
saw
that
the
fugitive
was
beyond
present
pursuit
he
wheeled
about
accordingly
and
set
his
men
in
motion
for
another
meeting
with
watson
that
commander
now
strengthened
and
just
doubling
the
numbers
of
our
partisan
with
fresh
supplies
of
provisions
and
military
stores
had
once
more
pushed
for
the
pedee
he
took
the
nearest
route
across
black
river
at
wragg
ferry
and
crossing
the
pedee
at
euhaney
and
the
little
pedee
at
potato
ferry
he
halted
at
catfish
creek
one
mile
from
the
present
site
of
marion
courthouse
marion
crossed
the
pedee
and
encamped
at
the
warhees
within
five
miles
of
the
enemy
here
he
planted
himself
in
vigilant
watch
of
the
force
which
he
could
not
openly
encounter
in
addition
to
the
want
of
men
he
labored
under
a
still
greater
want
of
ammunition
when
asked
by
capt
gavin
witherspoon
whether
he
meant
to
fight
watson
a
measure
which
witherspoon
thought
particularly
advisable
before
he
was
joined
by
any
more
bodies
of
tories
he
answered
that
would
be
best
but
we
have
not
ammunition
why
general
said
witherspoon
my
is
full
ah
my
friend
was
the
reply
of
marion
you
are
an
extraordinary
soldier
but
for
the
others
there
are
not
two
rounds
to
a
man
thus
stood
the
two
parties
and
thus
it
but
too
frequently
stood
with
our
partisan
wanting
the
most
simple
resources
by
which
to
make
his
own
genius
and
the
valor
of
his
men
apparent
that
the
former
was
alive
and
equal
to
emergencies
even
in
such
a
condition
of
necessity
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
he
should
dare
take
such
a
position
so
immediately
contiguous
to
an
enemy
double
his
own
force
and
abounding
in
all
the
requisite
materials
of
war
the
inactivity
of
watson
is
only
to
be
accounted
for
by
his
total
ignorance
of
the
resourceless
state
of
marion
rifles
while
marion
and
watson
were
thus
relatively
placed
the
former
was
apprised
of
the
return
of
greene
to
south
carolina
this
intelligence
accounted
for
the
hasty
retreat
of
doyle
he
was
summoned
by
lord
rawdon
to
camden
to
strengthen
that
position
against
the
american
force
which
was
advancing
in
that
direction
the
reappearance
of
greene
was
a
source
of
heartfelt
joy
to
those
who
but
a
little
while
before
had
anticipated
the
necessity
of
flying
before
the
foe
and
taking
shelter
in
the
mountains
it
was
because
of
the
absence
of
the
american
army
that
rawdon
was
enabled
as
we
have
seen
to
concentrate
his
chief
force
upon
marion
the
presence
of
greene
which
had
caused
the
recall
of
doyle
must
as
marion
well
knew
effect
that
of
watson
also
he
was
preparing
himself
accordingly
when
further
advices
brought
him
news
of
the
approach
of
colonel
lee
with
the
continental
legion
to
his
own
assistance
he
dispatched
a
guide
to
lee
and
by
means
of
boats
which
he
always
kept
secreted
the
legion
was
transported
over
the
pedee
and
a
junction
with
marion
force
was
effected
on
the
fourteenth
of
april
the
tidings
which
had
brought
such
gratification
to
the
camp
of
marion
had
as
inspiring
though
not
as
grateful
an
effect
in
that
of
watson
he
lost
no
time
in
breaking
up
his
encampment
the
safety
of
rawdon
and
camden
was
paramount
and
wheeling
his
two
into
catfish
creek
and
burning
his
baggage
as
doyle
had
done
he
sped
with
similar
precipitation
in
the
same
direction
the
route
taken
in
his
flight
declared
his
apprehensions
of
marion
he
trembled
at
the
recollection
of
the
recent
race
between
them
the
harassings
and
skirmishings
night
and
day
the
sleepless
struggles
and
unintermitting
alarms
recrossing
the
little
pedee
and
avoiding
euhaney
he
passed
the
waccamaw
at
ferry
and
retreating
through
the
neck
between
that
river
and
the
sea
crossed
winyaw
bay
three
miles
in
width
and
in
this
manner
arrived
in
georgetown
a
slight
glance
at
any
map
of
the
country
keeping
in
mind
that
watson
object
was
really
camden
will
show
the
reader
the
extent
of
his
fears
of
that
wily
and
indefatigable
enemy
from
whom
he
had
previously
escaped
with
so
much
difficulty
marion
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
pursue
watson
but
lee
though
subordinate
succeeded
in
preventing
this
desire
instructions
which
he
brought
from
greene
and
which
he
earnestly
dwelt
upon
required
their
cooperation
against
the
british
posts
below
camden
lee
urged
also
that
such
a
pursuit
would
take
them
too
far
from
greene
with
the
movements
of
whose
army
it
was
important
that
marion
force
should
act
as
intimately
as
possible
marion
yielded
the
point
with
great
reluctance
and
was
heard
repeatedly
after
to
regret
that
his
orders
did
not
permit
him
to
follow
the
dictates
of
his
own
judgment
had
he
done
so
with
his
force
strengthened
by
the
continental
bayonets
and
new
supplies
of
powder
for
his
rifles
watson
flight
to
georgetown
which
he
could
scarcely
have
reached
would
have
been
far
more
uncomfortable
than
he
found
it
on
the
previous
occasion
lee
led
the
way
with
his
legion
towards
the
santee
while
marion
placing
witherspoon
with
a
small
party
on
the
trail
of
watson
pursued
his
line
of
march
through
williamsburg
having
once
resolved
movements
were
always
rapid
and
energetic
on
the
fifteenth
of
april
only
a
day
after
the
junction
with
lee
he
was
before
fort
watson
this
was
a
stockade
fort
raised
on
one
of
those
remarkable
elevations
of
an
unknown
antiquity
which
are
usually
recognized
as
indian
mounds
it
stands
near
scott
lake
on
the
santee
river
a
few
miles
below
the
junction
of
the
congaree
and
wateree
the
mound
is
forty
feet
in
height
and
remote
from
any
other
elevation
by
which
it
might
be
commanded
the
garrison
at
this
post
consisted
of
eighty
regular
troops
and
forty
loyalists
it
was
commanded
by
lieut
mckay
a
brave
officer
of
the
regular
service
to
the
summons
of
marion
he
returned
a
manly
defiance
and
the
place
was
regularly
invested
besieged
and
besiegers
were
alike
without
artillery
with
a
single
piece
the
former
might
well
have
defied
any
force
which
marion
could
bring
against
him
the
place
would
have
been
impregnable
to
the
americans
as
it
was
its
steep
sides
and
strong
palisades
forbade
any
attempt
to
storm
to
cut
off
the
garrison
from
scott
lake
where
it
procured
water
was
the
first
step
taken
by
the
besiegers
but
the
besieged
by
sinking
a
well
within
the
stockade
below
the
level
of
the
contiguous
water
counteracted
the
attempt
for
a
moment
the
assailants
were
at
fault
and
without
artillery
the
prospect
was
sufficiently
discouraging
but
while
doubting
and
hesitating
mayham
of
the
brigade
suggested
a
mode
of
overawing
the
garrison
which
was
immediately
adopted
at
a
short
distance
from
the
fort
there
grew
a
small
wood
a
number
of
the
trees
of
which
were
hewn
down
and
transported
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
men
within
a
proper
distance
of
the
mound
here
during
the
night
all
hands
were
actively
employed
in
piling
the
wood
thus
brought
in
massive
and
alternate
layers
crosswise
until
the
work
had
reached
a
sufficient
elevation
at
dawn
the
garrison
were
confounded
to
find
themselves
at
wakening
under
a
shower
of
rifle
bullets
thus
overlooked
the
fort
was
no
longer
tenable
and
a
party
of
volunteers
from
the
militia
headed
by
ensign
baker
and
another
of
continentals
from
the
legion
led
by
lee
a
volunteer
ascended
the
mound
with
great
intrepidity
and
gained
the
abbatis
which
they
proceeded
to
destroy
this
movement
brought
the
garrison
to
terms
and
a
capitulation
immediately
followed
but
the
leaguer
had
consumed
eight
days
the
progress
of
which
had
been
watched
with
equal
anxiety
by
both
parties
the
americans
apprehended
and
the
garrison
anticipated
the
approach
of
watson
with
an
overwhelming
force
for
the
relief
of
the
besieged
but
watson
did
not
appear
he
no
longer
had
an
overwhelming
force
his
flight
to
georgetown
was
marked
by
loss
and
desertion
it
appears
that
his
panic
or
his
sense
of
duty
led
him
rather
to
avoid
marion
and
to
reach
camden
without
interruption
he
very
prudently
therefore
after
crossing
the
santee
on
the
route
from
georgetown
moved
down
by
monk
corner
added
to
his
force
the
garrison
of
that
place
and
then
cautiously
advanced
to
the
santee
he
resolved
rather
to
leave
fort
watson
to
its
fate
than
risk
a
force
which
might
be
necessary
to
the
exigencies
of
rawdon
watson
was
considered
by
the
british
one
of
their
best
partisans
yet
never
had
poor
warrior
been
so
worried
and
harassed
as
with
a
superior
force
he
had
been
by
marion
yet
in
his
second
expedition
in
pursuit
of
the
latter
had
he
been
able
to
cooperate
with
doyle
with
the
tories
of
harrison
and
gainey
all
preparing
for
the
same
object
the
escape
of
our
partisan
would
have
been
miraculous
at
no
time
during
their
pursuit
of
him
was
his
force
equal
to
the
smallest
one
of
theirs
he
must
have
been
expelled
the
country
as
he
himself
seemed
to
apprehend
or
he
must
have
fallen
in
the
conflict
we
have
so
little
at
the
hands
of
marion
in
the
shape
of
correspondence
that
we
are
tempted
to
give
his
official
letter
to
general
greene
apprising
him
of
the
fall
of
fort
watson
it
is
dated
fort

sir
lee
made
a
junction
with
me
at
santee
the
after
a
rapid
march
from
ramsay
mill
on
deep
river
which
he
performed
in
eight
days
the
we
marched
to
this
place
and
invested
it
our
hope
was
to
cut
off
their
water
some
riflemen
and
continentals
immediately
took
post
between
the
fort
and
the
lake
the
fort
is
situated
on
a
small
hill
forty
feet
high
stockaded
and
with
three
rows
of
abbatis
round
it
no
trees
near
enough
to
cover
our
men
from
their
fire
the
third
day
after
we
had
invested
it
we
found
the
enemy
had
sunk
a
well
near
the
stockade
which
we
could
not
prevent
them
from
doing
as
we
had
no
entrenching
tools
to
make
our
approach
we
immediately
determined
to
erect
a
work
equal
in
height
to
the
fort
this
arduous
work
was
completed
this
morning
by
major
maham
who
undertook
it
we
then
made
a
lodgment
on
the
side
of
the
mound
near
the
stockade
this
was
performed
with
great
spirit
and
address
by
ensign
johnson
and
lee
a
volunteer
in
lee
legion
who
with
difficulty
ascended
the
hill
and
pulled
away
the
abbatis
which
induced
the
commandant
to
hoist
a
flag
lee
and
myself
agreed
to
the
enclosed
capitulation
which
i
hope
may
be
approved
by
you
our
loss
on
this
occasion
is
two
killed
and
three
continentals
and
three
militia
wounded
i
am
particularly
indebted
to
lee
for
his
advice
and
indefatigable
diligence
in
every
part
of
these
tedious
operations
against
as
strong
a
little
post
as
could
well
be
made
and
on
the
most
advantageous
spot
that
could
be
wished
for
the
officers
and
men
of
the
legion
and
militia
performed
everything
that
could
be
expected
and
major
maham
of
my
brigade
had
in
a
particular
manner
a
great
share
of
this
success
by
his
unwearied
diligence
in
erecting
the
tower
which
principally
occasioned
the
reduction
of
the
fort
in
short
sir
i
have
had
the
greatest
assistance
from
every
one
under
my
command
enclosed
is
a
list
of
the
prisoners
and
stores
taken
and
i
shall
without
loss
of
time
proceed
to
demolish
the
fort
after
which
i
shall
march
to
the
high
hills
of
santee
encamp
at
capt
richardson
and
await
your
orders
signed
francis
marion
in
taking
post
at
the
santee
hills
the
object
of
marion
was
to
take
such
a
position
as
would
enable
him
to
watch
all
the
several
roads
by
which
watson
could
make
his
way
to
camden
it
was
important
if
possible
to
prevent
his
junction
with
lord
rawdon
thus
increasing
the
ability
of
that
commander
to
cope
with
greene
army
which
now
lay
before
that
place
but
marion
was
not
able
to
encounter
watson
without
assistance
lee
with
his
legion
had
been
withdrawn
by
greene
soon
after
the
capture
of
fort
watson
and
our
partisan
force
in
camp
from
concurring
circumstances
was
now
reduced
to
about
eighty
men
eighty
of
his
brigade
were
detached
under
irvine
to
rafting
creek
in
order
to
cut
off
supplies
from
camden
another
party
was
engaged
in
watching
a
rising
of
the
tories
on
the
pedee
who
in
the
absence
of
marion
himself
had
manifested
a
disposition
to
resume
the
offensive
harden
with
another
detachment
was
on
the
salkehatchie
having
first
succeeded
in
the
capture
of
fort
balfour
at
pocotaligo
in
which
he
made
nearly
a
hundred
prisoners
other
small
detachments
had
thinned
the
little
army
of
our
partisan
to
such
a
degree
that
it
was
of
small
efficiency
where
it
was
and
just
at
this
juncture
numerous
desertions
took
place
from
two
concurring
circumstances
the
approach
of
marion
to
the
hills
had
brought
on
the
battle
of
camden
unwilling
that
force
should
be
increased
by
the
militia
of
the
former
rawdon
had
resolved
not
to
wait
for
watson
but
to
march
out
and
give
battle
before
the
coming
of
either
he
did
so
the
affair
was
not
decisive
but
greene
was
compelled
to
yield
the
field
to
his
enemy
he
lost
nothing
whether
of
honor
or
position
by
this
result
but
as
the
news
spread
the
defeat
was
exaggerated
it
was
supposed
to
be
another
affair
such
as
that
of
gates
and
marion
small
body
of
men
was
still
farther
lessened
by
desertion
there
was
still
another
reason
for
its
present
feebleness
the
time
of
the
year
was
the
very
height
of
the
planting
season
and
the
in
numbers
left
the
camp
in
order
to
hurry
to
their
homes
and
set
their
crops
this
though
not
allowed
by
the
regular
disciplinarian
was
in
the
mind
of
the
a
duty
quite
as
imperative
as
any
that
he
owed
to
his
family
indeed
it
was
inseparable
from
his
necessities
that
where
the
government
did
not
give
him
bread
he
must
make
it
for
himself
his
family
could
not
starve
and
if
he
could
fight
without
pay
it
was
not
possible
that
he
should
do
so
without
food
in
the
sort
of
warfare
which
marion
had
hitherto
carried
on
he
had
been
willing
to
recognize
these
necessities
on
the
part
of
his
followers
cooperating
with
an
army
differently
constituted
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
do
so
with
any
hope
of
their
permanent
usefulness
just
at
this
juncture
in
particular
he
felt
the
peculiarly
mortifying
character
of
his
situation
to
enable
marion
to
contend
with
watson
greene
dispatched
major
eaton
with
a
body
of
continentals
to
his
assistance
with
instructions
to
throw
himself
across
the
path
of
watson
but
eaton
by
an
unhappy
misunderstanding
of
his
duty
failed
to
reach
him
in
season
for
this
object
when
he
did
join
him
which
was
on
the
evening
of
the
of
may
it
was
too
late
marion
writing
to
greene
says
major
eaton
not
coming
up
sooner
has
made
me
lose
a
great
deal
of
precious
time
i
shall
cross
the
santee
at
wright
bluff
he
did
so
but
watson
had
already
passed
and
succeeded
in
eluding
greene
also
and
in
reaching
camden
in
safety
we
have
spoken
of
harden
proceedings
against
fort
balfour
and
the
capture
of
that
post
this
officer
was
a
very
brave
and
active
gentleman
rapid
in
his
movements
and
resolute
in
his
objects
as
soon
as
marion
had
received
intelligence
of
greene
approach
to
south
carolina
he
had
dispatched
harden
with
seventy
select
men
well
mounted
to
penetrate
through
the
country
and
crossing
the
lines
of
communication
to
stir
up
the
people
in
all
that
region
which
lies
southwest
of
charleston
so
rapid
and
unexpected
were
his
movements
that
he
took
the
enemy
everywhere
by
surprise
and
rendered
himself
for
the
time
the
very
terror
of
the
loyalists
upon
the
route
his
force
increased
with
its
progress
the
inhabitants
yearned
for
an
escape
from
british
authority
and
joined
his
troop
his
seventy
men
soon
became
two
hundred
and
while
he
baffled
the
pursuit
of
the
superior
he
visited
with
sudden
and
severe
chastisement
the
disaffected
along
and
on
both
sides
of
the
savannah
river
ascending
this
he
soon
communicated
with
pickens
then
operating
against
augusta
and
nothing
now
was
wanting
but
the
fall
of
the
chain
of
posts
to
complete
the
recovery
of
the
whole
country
within
thirty
miles
of
the
sea
in
contributing
to
this
desirable
object
marion
now
strengthened
by
the
continentals
of
lee
and
eaton
invested
fort
motte
on
the
river
congaree
this
post
was
the
principal
depot
of
the
convoys
from
charleston
to
camden
and
sometimes
of
those
destined
for
forts
granby
and
a
large
new
belonging
to
motte
situated
on
a
high
and
commanding
hill
had
been
chosen
for
this
establishment
it
was
surrounded
with
a
deep
trench
along
the
inner
margin
of
which
a
strong
and
lofty
parapet
was
raised
to
this
post
had
been
assigned
a
sufficient
garrison
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
this
force
was
increased
by
a
small
detachment
of
dragoons
from
charleston
which
had
been
thrown
into
it
a
few
hours
before
the
appearance
of
the
americans
the
garrison
was
commanded
by
capt
mcpherson
a
firm
and
gallant
officer
opposite
to
fort
motte
to
the
north
stood
another
hill
where
motte
who
had
been
expelled
from
her
dwelling
resided
in
an
old
on
this
lee
took
position
with
his
corps
marion
men
occupied
the
eastern
declivity
of
the
same
ridge
on
which
stood
the
fort
the
place
was
very
soon
invested
the
six
pounder
with
which
greene
had
furnished
marion
was
mounted
on
a
battery
raised
in
the
quarter
which
he
occupied
for
the
purpose
of
raking
the
northern
face
of
the
parapet
mcpherson
was
in
the
possession
of
a
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
adapt
it
for
use
before
the
investment
took
place
it
does
not
seem
to
have
been
even
used
during
the
siege
his
chief
hopes
lay
in
being
relieved
by
a
detachment
from
camden
not
doubting
its
arrival
before
his
assailant
could
push
his
preparations
to
maturity
the
works
of
the
latter
advanced
rapidly
and
the
place
was
summoned
on
the
of
may
the
reply
declared
the
determination
of
the
besieged
to
try
the
strength
and
patience
of
the
besiegers
these
had
now
every
motive
for
perseverance
they
were
advised
of
the
approach
of
rawdon
with
all
his
force
to
the
relief
of
the
fort
that
stern
commander
finding
camden
was
no
longer
tenable
against
the
increasing
forces
of
the
americans
and
unable
to
maintain
his
several
posts
with
his
diminished
strength
was
aiming
to
contract
his
scattered
bodies
into
narrower
limits
having
made
a
second
but
unsatisfactory
demonstration
upon
greene
he
destroyed
his
unnecessary
baggage
and
leaving
camden
in
flames
he
once
more
abandoned
it
to
the
americans
greene
advised
marion
of
his
retreat
and
urged
him
to
expedition
on
the
next
night
he
reached
the
country
opposite
fort
motte
and
his
numerous
fires
on
the
highest
grounds
on
his
route
encouraged
the
garrison
with
hopes
of
success
which
were
not
to
be
realized
what
was
to
be
done
was
to
be
done
quickly
on
the
part
of
the
besiegers
the
process
of
battering
by
cannon
would
be
too
slow
some
shorter
mode
was
to
be
adopted
to
anticipate
the
approach
of
rawdon
the
ready
thought
of
our
partisan
suggested
this
process
it
was
known
that
the
large
mansion
of
motte
occupied
the
greater
part
of
the
area
of
the
fort
but
a
few
yards
of
ground
within
the
works
remained
uncovered
by
it
to
burn
the
house
by
fire
would
compel
the
surrender
of
the
garrison
the
necessity
was
very
reluctantly
communicated
to
the
widow
by
whom
the
property
was
owned
but
she
was
one
of
those
glorious
dames
of
the
revolution
to
whom
the
nation
is
so
largely
indebted
for
the
glory
of
that
event
she
had
received
the
american
officers
with
a
hospitality
which
made
them
almost
shrink
from
suggesting
their
purposes
but
as
soon
as
they
were
made
known
she
put
them
perfectly
at
ease
upon
the
subject
with
something
more
than
cheerfulness
with
pride
that
any
sacrifice
on
her
part
should
contribute
to
the
success
of
her
countrymen
in
so
dear
an
object
she
herself
produced
a
bow
with
all
the
necessary
apparatus
which
had
been
brought
from
india
and
which
she
had
preserved
by
the
arrows
from
this
bow
the
fire
was
to
be
communicated
to
her
dwelling
the
origin
of
this
bow
though
unimportant
is
nonetheless
the
subject
of
great
differences
james
says
an
indian
bow
and
arrows
though
one
would
expect
he
meant
american
indian
from
the
context
weems
implies
that
it
was
from
a
everything
being
in
readiness
the
lines
were
manned
and
an
additional
force
stationed
at
the
batteries
lest
the
enemy
in
the
moment
of
desperation
might
prefer
risking
an
assault
rather
than
endure
the
mortification
of
a
surrender
a
flag
was
sent
to
mcpherson
but
the
sight
of
rawdon
fires
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
encouraged
him
with
the
belief
that
he
might
still
resist
successfully
the
bow
was
put
into
the
hands
of
nathan
savage
a
private
in
brigade
it
was
noon
when
the
attempt
was
made
the
scorching
rays
of
the
noonday
sun
had
prepared
the
roof
for
the
conflagration
balls
of
blazing
rosin
and
brimstone
were
attached
to
the
arrows
and
three
several
shafts
were
sent
by
the
vigorous
arm
of
the
against
the
roof
they
took
effect
in
three
different
quarters
and
the
shingles
were
soon
in
a
blaze
mcpherson
immediately
ordered
a
party
to
the
roof
but
this
had
been
prepared
for
and
the
fire
of
the
soon
drove
the
soldiers
down
the
flames
began
to
rage
the
besiegers
were
on
the
alert
guarding
every
passage
and
no
longer
hopeful
of
rawdon
mcpherson
hung
out
the
white
flag
imploring
mercy
the
gentle
nature
of
marion
readily
yielded
to
his
prayer
though
as
lee
tells
us
policy
commanded
death
in
this
siege
marion
lost
two
brave
fellows
one
of
whom
has
been
more
than
once
conspicuous
in
this
narrative
the
daring
sergeant
mcdonald
and
lieutenant
cruger
mcdonald
had
reached
a
lieutenancy
before
he
fell
the
prisoners
were
paroled
but
their
officers
before
leaving
partook
of
a
sumptuous
dinner
given
by
motte
to
the
victors
this
noble
lady
whose
grace
of
demeanor
is
represented
as
quite
equal
to
her
patriotism
presided
at
her
table
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
all
parties
at
home
horry
tells
us
of
some
of
the
incidents
which
took
place
at
the
dinner
a
captain
of
the
british
army
taken
among
the
prisoners
on
finding
himself
near
horry
said
to
him
you
are
horry
i
presume
sir
horry
answered
in
the
affirmative
well
said
the
other
i
was
with
watson
when
he
on
sampit
fought
your
general
marion
i
think
i
saw
you
there
with
a
party
of
horse
i
think
you
were
also
at
nelson
ferry
when
marion
surprised
our
party
at
the
house
but
added
the
officer
i
was
hid
in
high
grass
and
escaped
were
you
not
there
also
horry
answered
no
it
was
my
brother
hugh
well
said
the
captain
you
were
fortunate
in
your
escape
at
sampit
for
watson
and
small
had
men
if
so
said
horry
i
certainly
was
fortunate
for
i
did
not
suppose
they
had
more
than
half
that
number
the
captain
then
added
i
consider
myself
equally
fortunate
in
escaping
at
nelson
old
field
truly
you
were
answered
horry
drily
for
marion
had
but
militia
on
that
occasion
at
this
says
our
worthy
colonel
the
captain
countenance
fell
and
he
retired
and
avoided
me
the
rest
of
the
day
general
greene
the
next
day
greene
had
reached
marion
camp
that
night
said
to
me
horry
how
came
you
to
affront
capt
ferguson
i
answered
he
affronted
himself
by
telling
his
own
story
it
militated
so
greatly
against
himself
as
to
compel
the
officers
who
were
near
to
laugh
the
captain
and
i
sir
agreed
that
we
were
both
equally
fortunate
in
war

memory
was
only
too
good

devoted
his
little
band
to
such
duties
as
would
lead
to
the
promotion
of
all
those
larger
plans
which
were
contemplated
for
the
execution
of
the
grand
army
his
scouts
had
served
for
pioneers
his
cavalry
procured
provisions
for
the
camp
and
it
was
to
marion
alone
that
greene
looked
for
all
his
intelligence
but
there
was
one
favorite
object
which
greene
had
in
view
to
which
our
partisan
could
contribute
little
the
want
of
a
cavalry
force
had
been
particularly
felt
by
the
former
and
he
had
been
sedulous
in
the
endeavor
to
supply
this
want
from
the
very
first
of
his
southern
campaigns
he
had
been
pressingly
calling
upon
sumter
marion
and
every
officer
who
might
be
thought
able
to
procure
him
a
supply
of
horses
and
active
agents
of
his
own
had
been
scouring
every
quarter
of
the
country
in
search
of
this
indispensable
agent
of
all
great
military
operations
his
quest
had
been
comparatively
vain
the
british
had
been
before
him
throughout
the
country
the
dragoons
of
tarleton
had
swept
the
stables
and
where
this
was
not
the
case
the
horses
were
held
by
militia
men
to
whom
they
were
quite
as
indispensable
as
to
the
grand
army
marion
troopers
could
only
be
of
service
while
in
possession
of
their
horses
they
had
large
and
extensive
tracts
of
country
to
traverse
could
procure
no
intelligence
without
and
any
attempt
to
dismount
a
soldier
from
his
favorite
steed
would
be
to
produce
a
degree
of
discontent
in
his
mind
which
would
most
certainly
deprive
the
country
of
his
services
to
expect
that
the
partisan
militia
under
marion
and
sumter
who
had
been
constantly
on
horseback
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
should
deliver
their
horses
up
to
others
who
possessed
no
higher
claim
upon
the
country
than
themselves
was
to
expect
more
largely
than
was
altogether
reasonable
from
the
liberality
or
the
patriotism
of
any
set
of
men
a
few
such
as
could
be
spared
had
been
supplied
by
marion
he
never
for
an
instant
contemplated
the
dismounting
of
his
troopers
those
hardy
fellows
who
had
been
constant
in
all
vicissitudes
who
had
murmured
at
no
tasks
shrunk
from
no
adventures
and
spared
neither
themselves
nor
their
property
when
the
necessities
of
the
country
required
at
periods
when
there
was
no
grand
army
to
divide
with
themselves
the
honors
and
the
dangers
of
the
war
nay
to
dismount
them
was
in
fact
to
disarm
himself
it
appears
however
that
this
was
expected
of
him
an
unfortunate
letter
of
lee
dated
the
may
and
addressed
to
greene
contained
this
paragraph
general
marion
says
the
letter
can
supply
you
if
he
will
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
good
dragoon
horses
most
of
them
impressed
horses
he
might
in
my
opinion
spare
sixty
which
would
be
a
happy
supply
the
effect
of
this
communication
upon
greene
was
immediate
and
painful
believing
that
he
had
been
and
vexed
that
marion
knowing
his
necessities
and
with
the
power
to
relieve
them
should
yet
have
forborne
to
do
so
though
urgently
exhorted
he
frankly
declared
his
feelings
in
the
very
next
letter
to
our
partisan
marion
did
not
dissemble
his
indignation
in
his
reply
he
repels
the
charge
that
he
had
ever
withheld
supplies
which
he
might
have
furnished
and
concludes
his
letter
by
requesting
permission
to
resign
firmly
but
respectfully
intimating
his
resolution
to
retire
from
service
as
soon
as
fort
motte
should
be
reduced
greene
in
an
instant
from
this
reply
perceived
the
mischief
that
he
had
done
he
wrote
instantly
to
marion
and
succeeded
though
with
difficulty
in
overcoming
his
resolution
he
says
my
reason
for
writing
so
pressingly
for
the
dragoon
horses
was
from
the
distress
we
were
in
it
is
not
my
wish
to
take
the
horses
from
the
militia
if
it
will
injure
the
public
service
the
effects
and
consequences
you
can
better
judge
of
than
i
can
you
have
rendered
important
services
to
the
public
with
the
militia
under
your
command
and
have
done
great
honor
to
yourself
and
i
would
not
wish
to
render
your
situation
less
agreeable
with
them
unless
it
is
to
answer
some
very
great
purpose
and
this
i
persuade
myself
you
would
agree
to
from
a
desire
to
promote
the
common
from
the
same
letter
we
make
another
extract
i
shall
always
be
happy
to
see
you
at
headquarters
but
can
not
think
you
seriously
mean
to
solicit
leave
to
go
to
philadelphia
it
is
true
your
task
has
been
disagreeable
but
not
more
so
than
others
it
is
now
going
on
seven
years
since
the
commencement
of
this
war
i
have
never
had
leave
of
absence
one
hour
nor
paid
the
least
attention
to
my
own
private
affairs
your
state
is
invaded
your
all
is
at
stake
what
has
been
done
will
signify
nothing
unless
we
persevere
to
the
end
i
left
a
family
in
distress
and
everything
dear
and
valuable
to
come
and
afford
you
all
the
assistance
in
my
power
to
promote
the
service
it
must
throw
a
damp
upon
the
spirits
of
the
army
to
find
that
the
first
men
in
the
state
are
retiring
from
the
busy
scene
to
indulge
themselves
in
more
agreeable
amusements
however
your
reasons
for
wishing
to
decline
the
command
of
the
militia
and
go
to
philadelphia
may
be
more
pressing
than
i
imagine
i
will
therefore
add
nothing
more
on
this
subject
till
i
see
you
the
adroit
mixture
of
reproach
with
commendation
was
not
done
without
reflection
greene
seems
to
have
understood
the
character
of
marion
but
there
was
some
oblique
injustice
in
his
letter
a
man
patriotism
is
not
to
be
reproached
because
he
wishes
to
escape
injustice
and
indignity
the
best
of
patriots
will
be
apt
to
become
disgusted
with
a
service
in
which
their
claims
are
neglected
their
performances
slurred
over
and
their
motives
impeached
and
this
too
at
a
period
and
after
long
periods
of
service
in
which
they
have
watched
toiled
and
fought
without
hope
or
prospect
of
reward
when
general
greene
compared
the
disagreeableness
of
marion
toils
with
those
of
others
he
certainly
overlooked
not
only
the
peculiar
character
of
those
toils
but
the
peculiar
privations
which
distinguished
the
career
of
men
and
the
particularly
painful
duties
which
so
frequently
belonged
to
it
his
own
previously
expressed
opinions
with
regard
to
the
warfare
as
carried
on
between
whig
and
tory
in
the
south
will
be
found
to
furnish
a
sufficient
commentary
upon
the
comparison
which
he
thus
makes
greene
himself
by
the
way
is
not
without
blame
in
some
respects
in
relation
to
the
southern
commanders
of
militia
the
slighting
manner
in
which
he
spoke
of
them
and
of
their
services
in
letters
not
intended
to
be
public
was
such
that
some
of
them
sumter
for
example
never
forgave
him
his
prejudices
were
those
of
the
regular
service
the
policy
of
which
is
always
to
disparage
the
militia
to
marion
himself
his
language
was
of
a
different
character
take
the
following
extract
of
a
letter
written
to
the
latter
only
one
month
before
the
correspondence
above
referred
to
this
letter
is
dated
from
the
camp
before
camden
april
and
will
give
a
faint
idea
of
the
true
claims
of
marion
upon
the
regard
of
his
country
when
i
consider
writes
greene
how
much
you
have
done
and
suffered
and
under
what
disadvantage
you
have
maintained
your
ground
i
am
at
a
loss
which
to
admire
most
your
courage
and
fortitude
or
your
address
and
management
certain
it
is
no
man
has
a
better
claim
to
the
public
thanks
than
you
history
affords
no
instance
wherein
an
officer
has
kept
possession
of
a
country
under
so
many
disadvantages
as
you
have
surrounded
on
every
side
with
a
superior
force
hunted
from
every
quarter
with
veteran
troops
you
have
found
means
to
elude
their
attempts
and
to
keep
alive
the
expiring
hopes
of
an
oppressed
militia
when
all
succor
seemed
to
be
cut
off
to
fight
the
enemy
bravely
with
the
prospect
of
victory
is
nothing
but
to
fight
with
intrepidity
under
the
constant
impression
of
defeat
and
inspire
irregular
troops
to
do
it
is
a
talent
peculiar
to
yourself
nothing
will
give
me
greater
pleasure
than
to
do
justice
to
your
merit
and
i
shall
miss
no
opportunity
of
declaring
to
congress
to
the
of
the
american
army
and
to
the
world
the
great
sense
i
have
of
your
merit
and
your
services
the
correspondence
of
greene
with
marion
on
the
subject
of
the
horses
closed
with
a
letter
on
the
part
of
the
latter
in
which
he
turned
off
the
affair
on
grounds
that
proved
his
feelings
tranquillized
a
present
of
a
fine
horse
for
greene
own
use
accompanied
this
letter
it
has
been
shown
that
on
the
day
of
the
capture
of
fort
motte
greene
rode
into
the
camp
of
marion
at
that
place
we
can
conceive
of
no
other
motive
for
his
presence
here
than
a
desire
to
make
his
reconciliation
perfect
he
brought
no
force
with
him
to
promote
the
object
of
the
besiegers
and
his
stay
was
limited
to
a
brief
interview
but
the
evil
effect
of
this
affair
did
not
end
here
the
militia
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
having
their
horses
taken
from
them
soon
began
to
scatter
and
pleading
the
planting
season
upon
which
they
had
entered
some
indeed
without
any
plea
they
left
the
camp
in
numbers
and
before
the
leaguer
was
well
over
the
force
of
marion
was
reduced
to
something
less
than
two
hundred
men
with
this
remnant
of
his
brigade
as
soon
as
fort
motte
was
yielded
marion
detached
himself
from
the
regular
troops
and
struck
down
towards
monk
corner
hanging
upon
the
skirts
of
lord
rawdon
army
then
in
full
retreat
from
camden
perhaps
the
most
interesting
portions
of
our
traditionary
history
in
the
south
will
be
found
to
have
occurred
to
the
scattered
bodies
of
the
partisan
cavalry
while
on
their
return
movements
to
and
from
the
army
after
such
a
dispersion
as
that
from
which
the
brigade
of
marion
was
now
suffering
it
was
no
easy
matter
for
the
small
group
or
the
single
trooper
to
regain
the
family
homestead
or
the
friendly
neighborhood
in
which
their
wives
and
little
ones
were
harbored
every
settlement
through
which
they
passed
had
its
disaffected
population
it
might
be
small
or
large
but
its
numbers
did
not
affect
its
activity
and
with
the
main
body
of
the
whigs
in
camp
or
on
the
road
the
tories
in
remote
sections
of
the
country
were
generally
equally
strong
and
daring
these
waylaid
the
customary
pathways
and
aware
of
all
the
material
movements
of
the
regular
troops
made
their
arrangements
to
cut
off
stragglers
or
small
detached
bodies
when
we
consider
the
active
malignity
by
which
the
civil
war
in
carolina
was
marked
the
wild
forests
in
which
it
took
place
the
peculiar
ferocity
which
it
stimulated
and
the
various
characteristics
of
the
local
modes
of
warfare
the
chase
and
the
surprise
we
shall
have
no
occasion
for
wonder
at
the
strange
and
sometimes
terrible
events
by
which
it
was
distinguished
one
of
these
which
occurred
to
captain
afterwards
colonel
snipes
of
marion
brigade
is
a
remarkable
instance
and
as
it
has
been
told
elsewhere
in
connection
with
the
life
of
marion
it
may
well
claim
a
place
in
this
narrative
snipes
was
a
carolinian
of
remarkable
strength
and
courage
he
was
equally
distinguished
for
his
vindictive
hatred
of
the
tories
he
had
suffered
some
domestic
injuries
at
their
hands
and
he
was
one
who
never
permitted
himself
to
forgive
his
temper
was
sanguinary
in
the
extreme
and
led
him
in
his
treatment
of
the
loyalists
to
such
ferocities
as
subjected
him
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
the
harshest
rebuke
of
his
commander
it
is
not
certain
at
what
period
in
the
war
the
following
occurrence
took
place
but
it
was
on
one
of
those
occasions
when
the
partisan
militia
claimed
a
sort
of
periodical
privilege
of
abandoning
their
general
to
look
after
their
families
and
domestic
interests
availing
himself
of
this
privilege
snipes
pursued
his
way
to
his
plantation
his
route
was
a
circuitous
one
but
it
is
probable
that
he
pursued
it
with
little
caution
he
was
more
distinguished
for
audacity
than
prudence
the
tories
fell
upon
his
trail
which
they
followed
with
the
keen
avidity
of
the
snipes
reached
his
plantation
in
safety
unconscious
of
pursuit
having
examined
the
homestead
and
received
an
account
of
all
things
done
in
his
absence
from
a
faithful
driver
and
lulled
into
security
by
the
seeming
quiet
and
silence
of
the
neighborhood
he
retired
to
rest
and
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
soon
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
from
this
he
was
awakened
by
the
abrupt
entrance
and
cries
of
his
driver
the
faithful
negro
apprised
him
in
terror
of
the
approach
of
the
tories
they
were
already
on
the
plantation
his
vigilance
alone
prevented
them
from
taking
his
master
in
bed
snipes
starting
up
proposed
to
take
shelter
in
the
barn
but
the
driver
pointed
to
the
flames
already
bursting
from
that
building
he
had
barely
time
to
leave
the
house
covered
only
by
his
night
shirt
and
by
the
counsel
of
the
negro
to
fly
to
the
cover
of
a
thick
copse
of
briars
and
brambles
within
fifty
yards
of
the
dwelling
when
the
tories
surrounded
it
the
very
task
of
penetrating
this
copse
so
as
to
screen
himself
from
sight
effectually
removed
the
thin
garment
which
concealed
his
nakedness
the
shirt
was
torn
from
his
back
by
the
briars
and
the
skin
shared
in
its
injuries
but
once
there
he
lay
effectually
concealed
from
sight
ordinary
conjecture
would
scarcely
have
supposed
that
any
animal
larger
than
a
rabbit
would
have
sought
or
found
shelter
in
such
a
region
the
tories
immediately
seized
upon
the
negro
and
demanded
his
master
at
the
peril
of
his
life
knowing
and
fearing
the
courage
and
the
arm
of
snipes
they
did
not
enter
the
dwelling
but
adopted
the
less
valorous
mode
of
setting
it
on
fire
and
with
pointed
muskets
surrounded
it
in
waiting
for
the
moment
when
their
victim
should
emerge
he
within
a
few
steps
of
them
heard
their
threats
and
expectations
and
beheld
all
their
proceedings
the
house
was
consumed
and
the
intense
heat
of
the
fire
subjected
our
partisan
in
his
place
of
retreat
to
such
torture
as
none
but
the
most
dogged
hardihood
could
have
endured
without
complaint
the
skin
was
peeled
from
his
body
in
many
places
and
the
blisters
were
shown
long
after
to
persons
who
are
still
living
but
snipes
too
well
knew
his
enemies
and
what
he
had
to
expect
at
their
hands
to
make
any
confession
he
bore
patiently
the
torture
which
was
terribly
increased
when
finding
themselves
at
fault
the
tories
brought
forward
the
faithful
negro
who
had
thus
far
saved
his
master
and
determined
to
extort
from
him
in
the
halter
the
secret
of
his
but
the
courage
and
fidelity
of
the
negro
proved
superior
to
the
terrors
of
death
thrice
was
he
run
up
the
tree
and
choked
nearly
to
strangulation
but
in
vain
his
capability
to
endure
proved
superior
to
the
will
of
the
tories
to
inflict
and
he
was
at
length
let
down
half
dead
as
in
truth
ignorant
of
the
secret
which
they
desired
to
extort
what
were
the
terrors
of
snipes
in
all
this
trial
what
his
feelings
of
equal
gratitude
and
apprehension
how
noble
was
the
fidelity
of
the
slave
based
upon
what
gentle
and
affectionate
relationship
between
himself
and
master
probably
from
boyhood
yet
this
is
but
one
of
a
thousand
such
attachments
all
equally
pure
and
elevated
and
maintained
through
not
dissimilar
perils

had
prompted
the
destruction
and
abandonment
of
that
place
by
lord
rawdon
this
was
the
plan
and
object
of
greene
the
precipitate
movements
of
rawdon
who
anticipated
the
purpose
of
the
former
necessarily
defeated
it
pickens
was
operating
against
augusta
while
sumter
leaving
the
investment
of
granby
the
conquest
of
which
was
considered
sure
to
taylor
proceeded
down
the
country
with
the
object
of
harassing
the
descent
of
the
british
army
and
to
prevent
them
from
carrying
off
the
cattle
of
the
inhabitants
in
the
former
object
neither
marion
nor
himself
had
much
success
they
did
not
succeed
in
effecting
a
junction
and
the
sanguine
desire
of
sumter
with
united
forces
to
operate
boldly
upon
the
retreating
army
of
rawdon
was
not
encouraged
by
greene
who
preferred
a
safe
and
sure
though
slow
progress
to
any
attainment
of
his
end
by
a
hazardous
attempt
however
glorious
the
task
of
holding
rawdon
in
check
was
confided
to
marion
and
sumter
while
greene
proceeded
with
his
whole
army
to
the
investment
of
the
post
of
at
the
village
of
cambridge
in
the
execution
of
their
duties
the
two
partisans
closed
in
upon
the
british
commander
until
he
established
a
line
of
fortified
posts
extending
from
georgetown
by
monk
corner
dorchester
to
coosawhatchee
within
this
line
our
partisans
continually
made
incursions
keeping
the
enemy
in
constant
check
and
apprehension
they
were
not
in
force
to
do
more
georgetown
however
separated
by
water
courses
and
swamps
of
great
magnitude
from
the
other
posts
was
left
with
a
garrison
so
feeble
as
to
tempt
marion
to
proceed
against
it
the
parishes
that
lie
along
the
santee
on
both
sides
towards
its
mouth
had
turned
out
with
so
much
zeal
on
his
return
into
their
neighborhood
that
he
soon
found
himself
in
sufficient
force
to
cover
the
country
with
a
strong
detachment
under
mayham
while
with
his
main
body
he
went
against
georgetown
he
appeared
before
this
place
on
the
of
june
and
instantly
began
his
approaches
but
his
simple
demonstration
was
sufficient
the
enemy
made
but
a
show
of
resistance
as
the
attempt
was
pressed
the
garrison
fled
to
their
galleys
and
took
a
position
in
the
bay
beyond
the
reach
of
the
americans
they
finally
abandoned
the
harbor
altogether
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
marion
to
man
the
post
efficiently
and
his
policy
forbade
that
he
should
do
it
inadequately
accordingly
he
deliberately
removed
the
military
stores
and
public
property
up
the
pedee
then
demolishing
the
works
returned
to
join
his
detachment
in
stephens
while
at
georgetown
however
it
is
recorded
that
he
replenished
his
wardrobe
and
fitted
himself
out
with
a
becoming
suit
of
regimentals
this
was
an
event
in
the
career
of
our
partisan
to
be
remembered
by
his
followers
he
indulged
it
seems
for
the
first
time
in
some
other
of
the
luxuries
of
the
campaigner
a
couple
of
mules
were
employed
for
the
transportation
of
his
baggage
and
his
usual
beverage
of
vinegar
and
water
was
occasionally
diversified
by
a
bowl
of
coffee
at
breakfast
a
little
before
this
perhaps
soon
after
general
greene
had
penetrated
the
state
he
had
appointed
himself
a
couple
of
secretaries
for
the
purpose
of
greater
dispatch
in
letter
writing
his
correspondence
necessarily
increasing
in
consequence
of
his
connection
with
the
more
expanded
operations
of
the
army
state
he
did
not
affect
and
the
simplicity
and
modesty
of
his
character
may
be
easily
inferred
from
this
petty
enumeration
of
the
aids
and
comforts
which
he
thought
proper
to
draw
from
his
successes
while
marion
in
person
proceeded
against
georgetown
peter
horry
was
dispatched
with
a
strong
body
of
men
against
the
loyalists
on
the
pedee
a
wild
and
bloodthirsty
band
of
borderers
under
the
conduct
of
major
gainey
of
whom
we
have
had
occasion
to
speak
already
horry
succeeded
in
awing
gainey
into
submission
and
in
extorting
from
him
a
treaty
by
which
he
consented
with
his
officers
and
men
to
maintain
a
condition
of
neutrality
this
submission
though
complete
was
but
temporary
it
required
subsequently
the
decisive
proceedings
of
marion
and
his
personal
presence
to
enforce
its
provisions
but
of
this
hereafter
while
greene
with
the
main
american
army
was
proceeding
against
preparations
were
made
by
the
british
in
charleston
for
ravaging
the
country
on
the
south
side
of
the
santee
the
people
of
john
and
stephen
parishes
had
shown
too
active
a
zeal
in
the
cause
of
liberty
to
escape
punishment
and
it
was
resolved
that
their
country
should
be
laid
waste
the
loyalists
of
charleston
and
that
vicinity
had
been
embodied
in
a
regiment
and
under
ball
prepared
to
carry
this
design
into
execution
but
marion
apprised
by
his
scouts
and
spies
of
every
movement
in
the
city
and
unable
with
his
present
force
to
meet
with
that
of
ball
determined
however
painful
the
necessity
to
anticipate
his
proceedings
and
with
his
usual
celerity
he
laid
waste
the
country
himself
removing
across
the
santee
to
places
of
safety
not
only
all
the
stock
and
cattle
but
all
the
provisions
that
could
be
collected
they
were
thus
saved
as
well
for
the
subsistence
of
his
men
as
for
the
proprietor
anxious
to
oppose
himself
more
actively
to
the
enemy
he
sent
pressing
dispatches
to
greene
for
assistance
in
covering
the
country
washington
with
his
admirable
corps
of
cavalry
was
accordingly
dispatched
to
his
assistance
we
have
seen
that
the
had
proceeded
in
person
against
the
british
post
at
to
sumter
and
marion
had
been
entrusted
the
care
of
rawdon
they
were
required
to
check
and
prevent
his
progress
in
the
event
of
any
attempt
which
he
might
make
to
relieve
the
post
they
were
unsuccessful
in
doing
so
the
arrival
of
a
british
fleet
with
reinforcements
comprising
three
fresh
regiments
from
ireland
enabled
rawdon
to
despise
any
attempts
which
with
their
inferior
force
our
partisans
might
make
some
idea
of
the
diligence
of
marion
and
the
excellence
of
his
plans
for
procuring
intelligence
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
the
charleston
paper
of
the
of
june
announcing
the
arrival
of
these
regiments
was
in
his
possession
the
very
day
on
which
it
was
printed
and
transmitted
instantly
through
sumter
command
to
greene
greene
was
unsuccessful
in
his
attempts
on
the
place
was
relieved
after
an
obstinate
defence
by
rawdon
who
with
his
new
troops
by
forced
marches
arrived
in
time
for
its
deliverance
greene
was
compelled
to
retreat
after
much
sanguinary
fighting
he
was
pursued
by
rawdon
for
a
small
distance
but
the
latter
contenting
himself
with
having
rescued
withdrew
the
garrison
and
abandoned
the
place
to
the
americans
he
was
in
no
condition
to
pursue
his
enemy
or
to
maintain
his
position
his
irish
regiments
were
not
to
be
trusted
and
the
maintenance
of
the
city
and
the
seaboard
were
paramount
considerations
with
such
active
and
enterprising
foes
as
marion
and
sumter
between
his
army
and
his
garrison
he
felt
the
insecurity
of
his
hold
upon
the
country
his
posts
in
the
interior
had
now
everywhere
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
americans
augusta
with
the
three
posts
cornwallis
grierson
and
galphin
had
just
been
yielded
to
the
arms
of
pickens
and
lee
there
were
no
longer
any
intermediate
posts
of
defence
from
orangeburg
to
and
the
latter
was
now
so
thoroughly
isolated
that
prudence
led
to
its
abandonment
this
necessity
brought
with
it
another
which
was
much
more
painful
and
humiliating
to
the
unfortunate
loyalists
of
that
country
who
had
so
long
sided
with
the
british
arms
against
their
countrymen
they
were
compelled
to
abandon
their
homes
and
share
the
fortunes
of
the
retreating
army
they
were
without
refuge
and
the
spirit
of
the
warfare
had
been
such
as
to
leave
them
hopeless
of
mercy
in
any
encounter
with
the
whigs
a
mournful
cavalcade
followed
in
the
train
of
the
british
army
and
retarded
its
progress
greene
as
he
discovered
rawdon
movements
to
be
retrograde
turned
upon
his
retreating
footsteps
his
cavalry
harassed
the
enemy
and
hastened
his
flight
at
ancrum
ferry
on
the
congaree
greene
in
advance
of
his
army
joined
marion
and
washington
the
latter
with
his
cavalry
the
former
with
four
hundred
mounted
militia
and
at
the
head
of
these
two
corps
pressing
down
the
orangeburg
road
on
the
of
july
he
succeeded
in
passing
lord
rawdon
retaining
command
of
washington
cavalry
he
dispatched
marion
with
his
mounted
militia
to
intercept
a
valuable
convoy
freighted
not
only
for
relief
of
army
but
with
all
the
various
supplies
and
material
necessary
for
the
establishment
of
the
british
post
at
granby
marion
was
unsuccessful
the
convoy
under
stewart
escaped
without
being
conscious
of
its
danger
he
had
taken
one
of
two
roads
while
marion
watched
for
him
upon
the
other
on
the
morning
of
the
stewart
and
rawdon
effected
a
junction
in
orangeburg
the
condition
of
the
british
army
on
that
day
is
thus
described
in
a
letter
of
marion
to
greene
johnson
greene
vol
p
their
troops
are
so
fatigued
they
can
not
possibly
move
three
regiments
were
going
to
lay
down
their
arms
and
it
is
believed
they
will
if
they
are
ordered
to
march
they
have
no
idea
of
any
force
being
near
them
at
orangeburg
rawdon
was
too
strongly
posted
for
any
attempts
of
greene
here
with
his
own
force
and
that
of
stewart
numbering
fifteen
hundred
men
he
was
joined
by
cruger
from
with
thirteen
hundred
more
orangeburg
is
situated
on
the
east
bank
of
the
north
edisto
which
half
encircles
it
north
and
south
are
swamps
and
ravines
which
so
nearly
approach
each
other
as
to
leave
but
a
narrow
and
broken
passage
on
the
east
side
the
gaol
a
strong
brick
building
of
two
stories
not
inferior
to
a
strong
redoubt
with
some
other
buildings
commanded
the
approach
the
crown
of
the
hill
on
which
it
stood
was
sufficiently
spacious
for
manoeuvering
the
whole
british
army
and
the
houses
and
fences
afforded
shelter
against
all
attempts
of
the
american
cavalry
or
mounted
militia
while
in
case
of
defeat
the
bridge
in
their
rear
afforded
as
secure
means
of
retreat
an
attempt
upon
such
a
position
with
a
force
consisting
chiefly
of
mounted
infantry
would
have
been
folly
and
greene
after
a
brief
demonstration
determined
to
withdraw
one
half
of
his
army
towards
the
congaree
while
the
other
was
sent
forward
upon
that
memorable
incursion
into
the
lower
country
by
which
the
enemy
from
all
quarters
were
driven
into
charleston
and
with
the
exception
of
the
force
at
orangeburg
for
a
brief
period
every
vestige
of
british
power
was
swept
away
down
to
the
very
gates
of
the
former
place
the
command
of
this
detachment
was
given
to
sumter
acting
under
him
were
marion
lee
the
hamptons
taylor
horry
mayham
and
others
of
those
active
partisans
who
had
kept
alive
the
war
from
the
beginning
the
command
consisted
of
all
the
state
troops
lee
legion
and
a
detachment
of
artillery
with
one
field
piece
in
all
about
a
thousand
men
the
object
of
this
movement
was
not
only
to
strike
at
the
british
line
of
posts
but
to
divert
the
attention
of
rawdon
from
the
congaree
where
it
was
his
policy
to
himself
in
force
the
force
under
sumter
as
it
approached
the
scene
of
operations
was
broken
into
separate
detachments
dorchester
was
yielded
without
resistance
to
the
corps
under
lee
while
wade
hampton
pressing
to
the
very
lines
of
charleston
captured
the
guard
and
patrol
at
the
quarter
house
and
spread
terror
through
the
city
sumter
and
marion
then
proceeded
against
the
post
at
biggin
held
by
coates
of
the
british
army
a
spirited
officer
with
a
garrison
of
five
hundred
infantry
one
hundred
and
fifty
horse
and
one
piece
of
artillery
the
post
at
biggin
consisted
of
a
redoubt
at
monk
corner
and
the
church
about
a
mile
distant
near
biggin
bridge
this
church
was
a
strong
brick
building
which
covered
the
bridge
and
secured
the
retreat
at
that
point
by
way
of
monk
corner
biggin
creek
is
one
of
many
streams
which
empty
into
cooper
river
of
these
it
is
the
most
northwardly
on
the
east
of
this
creek
the
road
to
charleston
crosses
watboo
and
quinby
creeks
the
destruction
of
watboo
bridge
rendered
impracticable
the
retreat
by
the
eastern
route
and
this
bridge
accordingly
became
an
important
object
to
both
the
british
and
americans
a
detachment
of
marion
men
under
mayham
was
sent
forward
to
destroy
the
watboo
bridge
and
thus
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
but
the
position
and
force
of
coates
prevented
the
approach
of
mayham
and
he
waited
the
advance
of
the
main
body
on
the
july
he
was
reinforced
by
a
detachment
under
peter
horry
who
assuming
the
command
proceeded
to
the
attempt
upon
the
bridge
the
enemy
cavalry
opposed
themselves
to
the
attempt
a
short
action
ensued
they
were
defeated
and
driven
back
with
loss
the
mounted
riflemen
broke
through
them
and
a
number
of
prisoners
were
taken
horry
then
dispatched
a
party
to
destroy
the
bridge
and
remained
to
cover
the
men
engaged
in
the
work
but
the
enemy
soon
reappeared
in
force
and
horry
with
his
working
party
was
compelled
to
retire
in
turn
upon
the
main
body
sumter
believing
that
coates
had
marched
out
to
give
him
battle
took
post
in
a
defile
and
awaited
him
but
the
purpose
of
the
enemy
was
only
to
gain
time
to
wear
out
the
day
amusing
him
while
they
made
secret
preparations
for
flight
their
stores
were
accumulated
in
the
church
which
had
been
their
fortress
and
at
midnight
the
flames
bursting
through
the
roof
of
the
devoted
building
announced
to
the
americans
the
retreat
of
the
foe
the
pursuit
was
immediately
commenced
and
in
order
that
it
might
not
be
impeded
the
only
piece
of
artillery
which
sumter
had
was
unfortunately
left
behind
under
lieut
singleton
lee
and
hampton
led
the
pursuit
until
having
passed
the
watboo
they
discovered
that
the
cavalry
of
the
enemy
had
separated
from
the
infantry
taking
the
right
hand
route
hampton
then
struck
off
in
pursuit
of
the
former
in
hope
to
overtake
them
before
they
could
reach
the
river
but
he
urged
his
panting
horses
in
vain
they
had
completed
their
escape
and
secured
the
boats
on
the
opposite
side
before
he
could
come
up
with
them
marion
cavalry
meanwhile
under
mayham
had
joined
the
legion
cavalry
in
pursuit
of
the
infantry
about
a
mile
to
the
north
of
quinby
creek
the
rearguard
of
the
retreating
army
was
overtaken
with
this
body
which
consisted
of
one
hundred
men
under
capt
campbell
was
nearly
all
the
baggage
of
the
british
army
terrified
by
the
furious
charge
of
the
americans
they
threw
down
their
arms
without
firing
a
gun
favored
by
this
circumstance
the
cavalry
of
mayham
and
the
legion
pressed
forward
coates
had
passed
quinby
bridge
and
made
dispositions
for
its
demolition
as
soon
as
the
and
baggage
should
have
passed
the
planks
which
covered
the
bridge
had
been
loosened
from
the
sleepers
and
a
howitzer
at
the
opposite
extremity
was
placed
to
check
the
pursuit
but
as
the
had
been
captured
without
firing
a
shot
their
commander
was
unapprised
of
their
fate
and
unprepared
for
immediate
defence
fortunately
for
his
command
he
was
present
at
the
bridge
when
the
american
cavalry
came
in
view
his
main
body
at
this
moment
was
partly
on
the
causeway
on
the
south
side
of
the
bridge
and
partly
pressed
into
a
lane
beyond
it
in
both
situations
so
crowded
as
to
be
almost
wholly
incapable
of
immediate
action
coates
however
coolly
took
measures
for
his
safety
orders
were
dispatched
to
them
to
halt
form
and
march
up
whilst
the
artillerists
were
summoned
to
the
howitzer
and
the
fatigue
party
to
the
destruction
of
the
bridge
the
legion
cavalry
were
in
advance
of
mayham
command
captain
armstrong
led
the
first
section
their
approach
to
the
bridge
was
marked
by
all
the
circumstances
of
danger
they
were
pressing
upon
each
other
into
a
narrow
causeway
the
planks
of
the
bridge
were
fast
sliding
into
the
water
and
the
blazing
hung
over
the
howitzer
the
disappearance
of
the
fatigue
party
from
the
bridge
would
be
the
signal
for
it
to
vomit
death
upon
the
ranks
of
the
approaching
americans
there
was
no
time
for
deliberation
armstrong
followed
close
by
his
section
dashed
over
the
bridge
and
drove
the
artillerists
from
the
gun
lieutenant
carrington
followed
but
the
third
section
faltered
mayham
of
marion
cavalry
feeling
the
halt
charged
by
them
but
the
death
of
his
horse
arrested
his
career
captain
macauley
who
led
his
front
section
pressed
on
and
passed
the
bridge
the
causeway
was
now
crowded
the
conflict
was
hand
to
hand
some
of
the
working
party
snatching
up
their
guns
delivered
a
single
fire
and
fled
two
of
the
legion
dragoons
were
slain
at
the
mouth
of
the
howitzer
several
wounded
but
the
officers
remained
unhurt
coates
with
several
of
the
british
covered
by
a
wagon
opposed
them
with
their
swords
while
their
troops
were
hurrying
forward
to
where
they
could
display
meanwhile
lee
with
the
rest
of
the
legion
had
reached
the
bridge
which
they
proceeded
to
repair
a
momentary
pause
for
reflection
a
glance
before
and
around
them
revealed
to
armstrong
and
macauley
the
fact
that
they
were
almost
alone
unsupported
by
their
party
and
with
the
british
recovering
themselves
in
front
they
reflected
that
only
while
the
british
officers
were
in
their
rear
should
they
be
secure
from
the
fire
of
the
enemy
in
front
and
urging
their
way
through
the
flying
soldiers
on
the
causeway
they
wheeled
into
the
woods
on
their
left
and
escaped
by
heading
the
stream
had
they
been
followed
by
the
whole
party
boldly
charging
across
the
bridge
the
entire
force
of
the
enemy
must
have
laid
down
their
arms
the
british
were
so
crowded
in
the
lane
and
causeway
in
such
inextricable
confusion
without
room
to
display
or
to
defend
themselves
that
they
must
have
yielded
by
spontaneous
movement
to
avoid
being
cut
to
pieces
the
reproach
lies
heavily
against
the
halting
cavalry
that
could
leave
to
their
fate
the
brave
fellows
who
had
crossed
the
bridge
colonel
coates
dared
not
longer
trust
himself
in
the
open
country
in
the
face
of
a
cavalry
so
active
and
powerful
retiring
to
plantation
after
destroying
the
bridge
he
resolved
to
defend
himself
under
cover
of
the
buildings
these
were
situated
on
a
rising
ground
and
consisted
of
a
of
two
stories
with
outhouses
and
fences
they
afforded
security
against
cavalry
and
a
good
covering
from
the
american
marksmen
it
was
not
till
that
sumter
with
the
main
body
of
the
americans
reached
the
ground
he
found
the
british
drawn
up
in
a
square
in
front
of
the
house
and
ready
to
receive
him
as
he
had
very
few
bayonets
to
march
directly
up
to
the
attack
would
have
been
out
of
the
question
he
divided
his
force
into
three
bodies
his
own
brigade
led
by
cols
middleton
and
polk
taylor
and
lacy
advanced
in
front
under
shelter
of
a
line
of
negro
houses
which
they
were
ordered
to
occupy
marion
brigade
thrown
into
two
divisions
was
ordered
to
advance
on
the
right
of
the
british
where
there
was
no
shelter
but
that
of
fences
and
those
within
forty
or
fifty
yards
of
the
houses
held
by
the
enemy
the
cavalry
constituted
a
reserve
to
cover
the
infantry
from
pursuit
sumter
brigade
soon
gained
the
negro
houses
from
whence
they
delivered
their
rifles
with
great
effect
taylor
with
about
men
of
his
regiment
pressing
forward
to
the
fences
on
the
enemy
left
drew
upon
him
the
bayonets
of
the
british
before
which
they
yielded
marion
men
in
the
meantime
seeing
the
danger
of
taylor
party
with
a
degree
of
firmness
and
gallantry
which
would
have
done
honor
to
any
soldiers
rushed
through
a
galling
fire
and
extricated
them
and
notwithstanding
the
imperfect
covering
afforded
them
by
the
rail
fence
along
which
they
ranged
themselves
they
continued
to
fight
and
fire
as
long
as
a
single
charge
of
ammunition
remained
with
the
corps
the
brunt
of
the
battle
fell
upon
them
and
they
maintained
in
this
the
reputation
acquired
in
many
a
border
struggle
more
than
fifty
men
all
of
marion
were
killed
or
wounded
in
this
affair
but
the
loss
did
not
dispirit
the
survivors
they
were
drawn
off
in
perfect
order
only
when
their
ammunition
was
expended
the
fight
lasted
three
hours
from
four
until
dark
seventy
of
the
british
fell
but
the
want
of
the
left
behind
with
singleton
and
the
failure
of
their
ammunition
not
a
charge
of
which
remained
with
the
americans
at
the
close
of
the
fight
saved
the
enemy
whose
infantry
alone
according
to
sumter
was
superior
to
his
whole
force
the
americans
attacked
them
with
half
their
number
but
coates
held
his
position
and
tidings
of
the
approach
of
rawdon
who
had
left
orangeburg
prompted
sumter
to
retreat
across
the
santee
his
expedition
had
not
been
successful
it
does
not
concern
us
to
inquire
by
whose
errors
or
defects
it
failed
enough
that
in
all
things
where
marion
and
his
men
were
concerned
they
acquitted
themselves
in
a
manner
calculated
to
sustain
their
former
reputation
the
attack
upon
coates
at
the
house
we
are
told
was
made
against
marion
opinion
who
blamed
sumter
for
wasting
the
lives
of
his
men
without
a
it
was
scarcely
possible
that
an
inferior
should
have
succeeded
against
a
superior
force
in
a
strong
position
sumter
was
courageous
to
rashness
his
spirit
could
not
be
restrained
in
sight
of
the
enemy
with
a
brave
force
at
his
command
he
was
not
satisfied
to
be
idle
and
his
courage
was
frequently
exercised
at
the
expense
of
his
judgment
the
men
of
marion
complained
that
they
had
been
exposed
unnecessarily
in
the
conflict
it
is
certain
that
they
were
the
only
sufferers
had
sumter
but
waited
for
his
artillery
and
simply
held
the
enemy
in
check
the
victory
must
have
been
complete
and
this
victory
was
of
the
last
importance
to
the
americans
it
would
have
involved
the
loss
of
one
entire
british
regiment
at
a
moment
when
two
others
having
been
required
at
new
york
from
south
carolina
the
force
remaining
with
rawdon
would
have
been
barely
adequate
to
the
retention
of
charleston
this
necessity
would
have
withdrawn
the
latter
general
at
once
from
orangeburg
and
the
subsequent
bloody
battle
of
eutaw
would
have
been
averted
accordingly
greene
speaking
of
this
combat
writes
the
affair
was
clever
but
by
no
means
equal
to
what
it
ought
to
have
been
the
whole
regiment
of
six
hundred
men
would
have
been
captured
if
general
sumter
had
not
detailed
too
much
and
had
not
mistaken
a
covering
party
for
an
attack
it
may
be
added
that
the
party
actually
engaged
in
the
attack
on
coates
were
almost
exclusively
south
carolina
militia
under
favorite
leaders
they
had
betrayed
no
such
apprehensions
as
are
natural
enough
to
men
who
lack
confidence
in
themselves
and
captains
they
had
shown
the
courage
of
veterans
though
they
may
have
failed
of
that
entire
success
which
is
usually
supposed
to
follow

a
veteran

his

a
wretched
state

in

of
sickness
the
region
to
which
he
retired
was
famous
for
its
salubrity
and
the
intense
heat
of
the
season
effectually
forbade
much
military
activity
the
opposing
generals
were
content
to
watch
each
other
it
was
while
he
held
this
position
that
hayne
of
the
militia
was
executed
as
a
traitor
by
the
british
the
case
of
this
gentleman
was
that
of
many
in
the
state
he
had
taken
parole
at
a
time
when
the
country
was
overrun
by
the
enemy
this
parole
was
subsequently
withdrawn
by
the
conquerors
when
they
supposed
the
people
to
have
been
subdued
and
desired
their
services
as
militia
but
the
british
were
in
turn
driven
from
the
field
the
americans
acquired
the
ascendant
the
section
of
the
country
in
which
hayne
resided
was
overrun
by
a
detachment
of
marion
under
harden
and
hayne
availed
himself
of
the
occasion
to
take
up
arms
for
his
country
he
was
a
popular
gentleman
and
soon
gathered
a
strong
party
of
militia
his
career
was
distinguished
by
some
small
successes
and
with
a
party
of
harden
horse
by
a
sudden
dash
in
the
vicinity
of
charleston
he
succeeded
in
taking
prisoner
general
williamson
formerly
of
the
americans
whose
life
was
forfeited
to
the
country
the
capture
of
williamson
put
all
the
available
cavalry
of
the
british
into
activity
and
by
an
unfortunate
indiscretion
hayne
suffered
himself
to
be
overtaken
his
execution
soon
followed
his
capture
this
was
a
proceeding
equally
barbarous
and
unjustifiable
neither
sanctioned
by
policy
nor
propriety
it
took
place
after
a
brief
examination
and
without
any
trial
the
proceeding
was
equally
unauthorized
by
civil
and
martial
law
it
was
not
long
before
this
as
the
reader
will
remember
that
marion
in
consequence
of
the
execution
of
some
of
his
men
by
the
british
had
threatened
them
with
retaliation
greene
who
knew
the
decisive
character
of
marion
and
was
apprehensive
that
this
wanton
crime
would
render
him
as
prompt
as
he
was
fearless
in
avenging
it
thus
writes
to
prevent
him
do
not
take
any
measures
in
the
matter
towards
retaliation
for
i
do
not
intend
to
retaliate
upon
the
tory
officers
but
the
british
it
is
my
intention
to
demand
the
reasons
of
the
colonel
being
put
to
death
and
if
they
are
unsatisfactory
as
i
am
sure
they
will
be
and
if
they
refuse
to
make
satisfaction
as
i
expect
they
will
to
publish
my
intention
of
giving
no
quarter
to
british
officers
of
any
rank
that
fall
into
our
hands
should
we
attempt
to
retaliate
upon
their
militia
officers
i
am
sure
they
would
persevere
in
the
measure
in
order
to
increase
the
animosity
between
the
whigs
and
tories
that
they
might
stand
idle
spectators
and
see
them
butcher
each
other
as
i
do
not
wish
my
intentions
known
to
the
enemy
but
through
an
official
channel
and
as
this
will
be
delayed
for
some
few
days
to
give
our
friends
in
augustine
time
to
get
off
i
wish
you
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
any
mortal
out
of
your
family
weems
represents
marion
as
being
greatly
averse
to
this
measure
of
retaliation
and
as
having
censured
those
officers
of
the
regular
army
who
demanded
of
greene
the
adoption
of
this
remedy
but
the
biographer
wrote
rather
from
his
own
benevolent
nature
than
from
the
record
marion
had
no
scruples
about
the
necessity
of
such
a
measure
in
particular
cases
and
however
much
he
might
wish
to
avoid
its
execution
he
was
yet
fully
prepared
to
adopt
it
whenever
the
policy
of
the
proceeding
was
unquestionable
fortunately
the
decisive
resolutions
which
were
expressed
by
the
americans
their
increasing
successes
the
fact
that
they
had
several
british
officers
of
reputation
in
their
hands
all
conspired
to
produce
in
the
minds
of
the
enemy
a
greater
regard
to
the
rights
of
justice
and
humanity
as
retaliation
in
such
cases
is
justifiable
only
as
a
preventive
and
remedial
measure
it
now
ceased
to
be
necessary
and
with
proper
views
of
the
affair
the
resolves
of
greene
and
marion
were
suffered
to
remain
unexpunged
in
proof
of
their
indignation
rather
than
their
purpose
but
a
few
days
had
elapsed
after
the
execution
of
hayne
when
a
party
of
marion
men
under
captain
ervine
fell
in
with
and
captured
a
favorite
british
officer
captain
campbell
with
two
subalterns
in
charge
of
a
convoying
detachment
they
were
at
once
committed
to
the
provost
guard
and
soon
communicated
their
apprehensions
to
charleston
a
meeting
of
british
officers
was
held
and
their
dissatisfaction
at
this
new
feature
introduced
into
the
warfare
of
the
country
was
expressed
in
such
terms
as
contributed
along
with
the
prompt
proceedings
of
the
americans
to
bring
balfour
the
commandant
of
charleston
under
whose
authority
the
execution
of
hayne
had
taken
place
to
a
better
sense
of
mercy
and
prudence
we
shall
have
no
farther
occasion
to
refer
to
these
proceedings
it
is
enough
that
the
threat
of
retaliation
followed
up
by
such
decided
movements
as
left
no
doubt
of
the
resolution
of
the
americans
produced
all
the
beneficial
effects
which
could
have
accrued
from
its
execution
the
incursion
of
sumter
and
marion
into
the
low
country
drew
lord
rawdon
from
orangeburg
with
five
hundred
men
to
charleston
from
which
place
after
lingering
just
long
enough
to
witness
the
death
of
hayne
he
sailed
for
new
york
he
left
stewart
in
command
at
orangeburg
from
this
post
stewart
moved
to
mccord
ferry
on
the
congaree
on
the
south
side
of
which
he
took
post
amidst
the
hills
near
the
confluence
of
the
wateree
and
congaree
greene
camp
lay
directly
opposite
and
the
fires
of
the
mutual
armies
were
distinctly
seen
by
each
other
the
heat
of
the
weather
suspended
all
regular
military
operations
two
large
rivers
intervening
secured
each
from
sudden
attack
and
their
toils
were
confined
to
operating
in
small
detachments
for
foraging
or
convoy
in
this
service
on
the
american
side
washington
was
detached
as
soon
as
the
course
of
stewart
was
ascertained
down
the
country
across
the
santee
lee
was
sent
upward
along
the
north
bank
of
the
congaree
the
latter
to
operate
with
henderson
then
in
command
of
sumter
brigade
at
fridig
ferry
and
the
former
to
strike
at
the
communication
between
the
enemy
and
charleston
and
to
cooperate
with
marion
and
mayham
in
covering
the
lower
santee
harden
at
the
same
time
with
a
body
of
mounted
militia
had
it
in
charge
to
straiten
the
enemy
upon
the
edisto
the
activity
of
these
several
parties
and
their
frequent
successes
were
such
that
stewart
was
compelled
to
look
for
his
supplies
to
the
country
below
him
this
necessity
caused
him
to
and
strengthen
the
post
at
dorchester
in
order
to
cover
the
communication
by
orangeburg
and
to
place
a
force
at
fairlawn
near
the
head
of
the
navigation
of
cooper
river
from
which
supplies
from
charleston
were
transported
to
headquarters
over
land
as
this
route
was
watched
by
marion
washington
and
mayham
the
british
commander
was
compelled
in
order
to
secure
the
means
of
communication
with
the
opposite
bank
of
the
congaree
and
to
draw
supplies
from
thence
to
transport
boats
adapted
to
the
purpose
on
from
fairlawn
to
the
congaree
such
were
the
relative
positions
of
the
two
armies
until
the
of
august
when
greene
calling
in
all
his
detachments
except
those
under
marion
mayham
and
harden
broke
up
his
camp
at
the
high
hills
and
proceeded
to
howell
ferry
on
the
congaree
with
the
intention
immediately
to
cross
it
and
advance
upon
stewart
that
officer
on
hearing
of
the
movement
of
the
americans
fell
back
upon
his
reinforcements
and
convoys
and
took
up
a
strong
position
at
the
eutaw
springs
meanwhile
marion
disappeared
from
the
santee
on
one
of
those
secret
expeditions
in
which
his
wonderful
celerity
and
adroit
management
conducted
his
men
so
frequently
to
success
his
present
aim
was
the
harden
was
at
this
time
in
that
quarter
and
closely
pressed
by
a
superior
british
force
of
five
hundred
men
detaching
a
party
of
mounted
militia
to
the
neighborhood
of
dorchester
and
corner
as
much
to
divert
the
enemy
from
his
own
movements
as
with
any
other
object
he
proceeded
with
two
hundred
picked
men
on
his
secret
expedition
by
a
forced
march
he
crossed
the
country
from
stephen
to
the
edisto
passing
through
both
lines
of
the
enemy
communication
with
charleston
and
reached
harden
a
distance
of
one
hundred
miles
in
season
for
his
relief
his
approach
and
arrival
were
totally
unsuspected
by
the
enemy
for
whom
he
prepared
an
ambush
in
a
swamp
near
ferry
a
small
body
of
his
swiftest
horse
were
sent
out
to
decoy
the
british
into
the
snare
a
white
feather
rather
too
conspicuously
worn
by
one
of
his
men
in
ambush
had
nearly
defeated
his
design
some
tories
passing
discovered
this
unnecessary
plumage
and
one
of
them
fired
upon
the
wearer
this
led
to
an
exchange
of
shots
but
major
frazier
by
whom
the
british
were
commanded
assuming
the
party
thus
concealed
to
be
that
of
harden
whom
it
was
his
aim
to
find
pursued
the
horsemen
whom
marion
had
sent
out
to
entice
him
to
the
ambuscade
his
cavalry
was
led
at
full
charge
within
forty
yards
of
the
concealed
riflemen
a
deadly
fire
was
poured
in
under
which
the
british
recoiled
attempting
to
wheel
and
charge
the
swamp
they
received
a
second
and
closely
wedged
as
their
men
were
upon
the
narrow
causeway
over
which
they
came
every
shot
bore
its
warrant
there
was
no
retreating
no
penetrating
the
ambush
and
the
british
cavalry
had
but
to
go
forward
along
the
road
to
the
ferry
thus
passing
the
entire
line
of
the
ambuscade
the
corps
was
most
effectually
thinned
by
the
time
it
got
beyond
rifle
reach
and
still
more
fatal
would
have
been
the
affray
to
the
advancing
infantry
of
frazier
a
large
body
with
a
but
for
one
of
those
lamentable
deficiencies
of
materiel
which
so
frequently
plucked
complete
success
from
the
grasp
of
the
americans
the
ammunition
of
our
partisan
failed
him
and
he
was
compelled
to
yield
the
ground
to
the
enemy
who
was
otherwise
wholly
in
his
power
the
british
loss
was
unknown
dead
horses
were
counted
on
the
field
the
day
after
the
men
had
all
been
buried
as
marion
men
fired
with
either
a
ball
or
heavy
and
as
none
would
aim
at
horses
the
loss
of
the
british
must
have
been
very
great
nine
days
after
at
the
battle
of
eutaw
they
had
few
cavalry
in
the
field
but
though
the
victory
was
incomplete
marion
had
attained
his
object
he
had
rescued
harden
without
loss
to
himself
he
had
traversed
more
than
two
hundred
miles
of
country
through
a
region
held
by
the
enemy
returned
by
the
same
route
delivered
his
prisoners
to
the
care
of
mayham
returned
twenty
miles
below
the
eutaw
in
order
to
watch
the
communication
between
that
place
and
fairlawn
then
at
the
call
of
greene
made
a
circuit
and
passed
the
british
army
so
as
to
reach
a
position
on
the
south
side
of
the
santee
in
the
track
of
advance
and
all
this
in
the
brief
compass
of
six
days
yet
of
these
movements
which
merited
and
received
the
particular
thanks
of
congress
we
are
without
any
data
in
our
records
the
complimentary
resolution
of
congress
fixes
the
battle
at
parker
ferry
on
the
august
seventeen
miles
from
eutaw
springs
at
lauren
plantation
marion
effected
a
junction
with
the
greene
was
pressing
forward
to
a
meeting
with
stewart
of
this
object
the
latter
seemed
to
have
been
profoundly
ignorant
up
to
this
moment
but
the
day
before
he
knew
that
marion
was
twenty
miles
below
him
and
did
not
conjecture
that
by
marching
the
whole
night
he
had
thrown
himself
above
him
to
join
with
greene
without
this
junction
he
had
no
apprehension
that
the
latter
with
an
inferior
force
would
venture
an
attack
upon
him
in
the
strong
position
which
he
held
on
the
afternoon
of
the
september
the
army
reached
burdell
tavern
on
the
congaree
road
seven
miles
from
the
eutaws
the
force
under
greene
amounted
to
two
thousand
men
all
told
that
under
general
stewart
was
probably
about
the
same
it
is
estimated
to
have
been
two
thousand
three
hundred
these
were
all
disciplined
troops
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
old
regiments
consisted
of
native
marksmen
from
the
ranks
of
the
loyalists
in
cavalry
greene
had
the
advantage
but
a
great
portion
of
his
men
were
militia
in
artillery
the
two
armies
were
equal
the
british
had
five
and
the
americans
four
pieces
the
memorable
battle
of
the
eutaw
springs
was
fought
on
the
september
at
four
in
the
morning
the
americans
moved
from
their
bivouac
down
to
the
attack
the
day
was
fair
but
intensely
hot
but
the
combatants
at
the
commencement
of
the
battle
were
relieved
by
the
shade
of
the
woods
the
south
carolina
state
troops
and
lee
legion
formed
the
advance
under
colonel
henderson
the
militia
both
of
south
and
north
carolina
moved
next
under
marion
then
followed
the
regulars
under
sumner
and
the
rear
was
closed
by
washington
cavalry
and
kirkwood
delawares
under
washington
the
artillery
moved
between
the
columns
the
troops
were
thus
arranged
in
reference
to
their
order
of
battle
of
the
approach
of
the
americans
stewart
was
wholly
ignorant
on
the
evening
of
the
the
only
patrol
which
had
been
sent
up
the
congaree
road
had
been
captured
during
the
night
and
stewart
himself
says
in
excuse
that
the
americans
had
waylaid
the
swamps
and
passes
in
such
a
manner
as
to
cut
off
every
avenue
of
intelligence
so
entirely
secure
had
he
felt
himself
in
his
position
which
was
a
strong
one
that
he
had
sent
out
an
unarmed
party
of
one
hundred
men
in
the
very
direction
of
greene
advance
to
gather
sweet
potatoes
this
party
called
a
rooting
party
after
advancing
about
three
miles
had
pursued
a
road
to
the
right
which
led
to
the
river
plantations
advised
by
two
deserters
from
the
north
carolina
militia
of
greene
approach
stewart
dispatched
captain
coffin
with
his
cavalry
to
recall
the
rooting
party
and
to
reconnoitre
the
americans
before
coffin
could
effect
either
object
he
encountered
the
american
advance
and
in
total
ignorance
of
its
strength
charged
it
with
a
degree
of
confidence
which
led
greene
to
imagine
that
stewart
with
his
whole
army
was
at
hand
coffin
was
easily
repulsed
the
rooting
party
alarmed
by
the
firing
hurried
from
the
woods
and
were
all
made
prisoners
meanwhile
stewart
now
thoroughly
aware
of
the
proximity
of
his
enemy
pushed
forward
a
detachment
of
infantry
a
mile
distant
from
the
eutaw
with
orders
to
engage
and
detain
the
american
troops
while
he
formed
his
men
and
prepared
for
battle
but
greene
whom
the
audacity
of
coffin
had
deceived
halted
his
columns
where
they
stood
and
proceeded
to
display
them
the
column
of
militia
formed
the
first
line
the
south
carolina
militia
in
equal
divisions
on
the
right
and
left
and
the
north
carolinians
in
the
centre
general
marion
commanded
the
right
general
pickens
the
left
and
malmedy
the
centre
henderson
with
the
state
troops
including
sumter
brigade
covered
the
left
of
this
line
and
lee
with
his
legion
the
right
the
column
of
regulars
also
displayed
in
one
line
the
north
carolinians
under
sumner
occupied
the
right
the
marylanders
under
williams
the
left
the
virginians
under
campbell
the
centre
two
pieces
of
artillery
were
assigned
to
each
line
washington
moved
in
column
in
the
rear
keeping
himself
in
reserve
in
this
order
the
troops
pressed
forward
slowly
as
the
country
on
both
sides
of
the
road
was
in
wood
and
prevented
much
expedition
moving
thus
the
first
line
encountered
the
advance
parties
of
stewart
and
drove
them
before
it
until
the
entire
line
of
the
british
army
displayed
in
order
of
battle
received
and
gave
shelter
to
the
fugitives
the
troops
of
stewart
were
drawn
up
in
one
line
at
about
two
hundred
yards
west
of
the
eutaw
springs
the
buffs
on
the
right
cruger
corps
in
the
centre
and
the
and
on
the
left
major
marjoribanks
with
three
hundred
of
his
best
troops
was
strongly
posted
so
as
to
flank
the
buffs
under
shelter
of
a
thick
wood
on
the
eutaw
creek
which
covered
the
right
of
the
whole
line
the
left
was
in
military
air
resting
in
the
wood
and
supported
by
cavalry
reduced
to
a
very
small
number
and
a
respectable
detachment
of
infantry
his
ground
was
altogether
in
wood
but
at
a
small
distance
in
the
rear
of
his
line
was
an
open
field
on
the
edge
of
which
stood
a
strong
brick
dwelling
with
offices
and
a
palisadoed
garden
in
all
of
which
a
stout
resistance
might
be
made
on
this
brick
house
stewart
had
already
cast
his
eyes
as
the
means
of
saving
his
army
in
any
necessity
the
house
was
of
two
stories
and
abundantly
strong
to
resist
small
arms
its
windows
commanded
all
the
open
space
around
major
sheridan
was
ordered
to
throw
himself
into
it
with
his
command
in
case
of
an
unfavorable
issue
to
the
fight
and
in
this
position
to
overawe
the
americans
and
cover
the
army
feeble
in
cavalry
in
which
the
americans
were
strong
there
was
no
other
means
for
retreat
and
support
in
the
event
of
a
capital
misfortune
the
american
approach
was
from
the
west
the
first
line
consisting
wholly
of
militia
went
into
action
and
continued
in
it
with
a
coolness
and
stubbornness
which
says
greene
would
have
graced
the
veterans
of
the
great
king
of
prussia
such
conduct
was
almost
invariable
on
their
part
wherever
marion
or
pickens
commanded
steadily
and
without
faltering
they
advanced
into
the
hottest
of
the
enemy
fire
with
shouts
and
exhortations
which
were
not
lessened
by
the
continual
fall
of
their
comrades
around
them
their
line
was
all
the
while
receiving
the
fire
of
double
their
number
they
were
opposed
to
the
entire
line
of
the
british
the
carnage
was
severe
and
very
equal
on
both
sides
the
two
pieces
of
artillery
were
at
length
disabled
and
after
exchanging
seventeen
rounds
with
the
enemy
the
militia
began
to
falter
sumner
was
ordered
up
to
their
support
with
the
north
carolina
continentals
with
the
advance
of
sumner
stewart
brought
into
line
on
his
left
the
infantry
of
his
reserve
and
the
battle
between
fresh
troops
on
both
sides
raged
with
renewed
fury
from
the
commencement
of
the
action
the
infantry
of
the
american
covering
parties
right
and
left
had
been
steadily
engaged
the
state
troops
under
henderson
had
suffered
greatly
the
american
left
which
they
flanked
falling
far
short
of
the
british
right
in
length
they
were
exposed
to
the
oblique
fire
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
british
left
and
particularly
of
the
battalion
commanded
by
marjoribanks
henderson
himself
was
disabled
and
his
men
denied
to
charge
the
enemy
under
whose
fire
they
were
suffering
for
they
were
necessary
to
the
safety
of
the
artillery
and
militia
were
subjected
to
a
trial
of
their
constancy
which
very
few
soldiers
whatever
may
have
been
their
training
would
have
borne
so
well
meanwhile
the
brigade
of
sumner
recoiled
from
the
fire
of
the
greater
numbers
opposed
to
them
in
front
at
this
sight
the
exultation
of
the
british
left
hurried
them
forward
assured
of
certain
victory
their
line
became
deranged
and
the
american
general
promptly
availing
himself
of
the
opportunity
issued
his
command
to
williams
who
had
in
charge
the
remaining
portion
of
his
second
line
to
advance
and
sweep
the
field
with
his
bayonets
the
two
battalions
obeyed
the
order
with
a
shout
the
virginians
when
within
forty
yards
of
the
enemy
poured
in
a
destructive
fire
and
the
whole
second
line
with
trailed
arms
pressed
on
to
the
charge
the
advanced
left
of
the
british
recoiled
and
just
at
this
juncture
the
legion
infantry
delivered
an
enfilading
fire
which
threw
them
into
irretrievable
disorder
the
british
centre
pressed
upon
by
the
fugitives
began
to
give
way
from
left
to
right
and
the
fire
of
the
marylanders
poured
in
at
the
proper
moment
completed
their
disaster
their
whole
front
yielded
and
the
shouts
of
the
americans
declared
their
exultation
as
at
a
victory
already
won
unquestionably
the
day
was
theirs
the
enemy
had
fled
from
the
battle
but
a
new
one
was
to
begin
in
which
victory
at
present
so
secure
was
taken
from
their
grasp
in
the
effort
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
rallying
and
to
cut
him
off
from
the
brick
dwelling
into
which
sheridan
obeying
the
commands
of
stewart
had
thrown
himself
as
soon
as
the
necessity
became
apparent
the
greatest
loss
of
the
americans
was
sustained
marjoribanks
still
held
his
ground
with
his
entire
battalion
in
the
thick
woods
which
skirted
eutaw
creek
and
so
well
covered
was
he
that
in
an
attempt
to
penetrate
with
his
cavalry
washington
became
entangled
in
the
thicket
and
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
while
his
men
suffered
severely
from
their
fire
and
his
troop
was
routed
a
second
time
were
they
brought
to
the
charge
but
with
no
better
success
than
before
marjoribanks
still
maintained
his
position
watching
the
moment
when
to
emerge
from
the
thicket
with
the
best
prospect
of
safety
to
himself
and
hurt
to
the
americans
he
was
soon
to
have
an
opportunity
the
british
line
had
yielded
and
broken
before
the
american
bayonet
the
latter
pressed
closely
upon
their
heels
made
many
prisoners
and
might
have
cut
them
off
and
by
isolating
marjoribanks
forced
him
to
surrender
but
for
one
of
those
occurrences
which
so
frequently
in
battle
change
the
fortunes
of
the
day
the
course
of
the
fugitives
led
them
directly
through
the
british
encampment
there
everything
was
given
up
for
lost
the
tents
were
all
standing
the
commissaries
had
abandoned
their
stores
and
the
numerous
retainers
of
the
army
were
already
in
full
flight
for
charleston
when
the
pursuing
americans
penetrated
the
encampment
they
lost
sight
of
the
fugitives
in
the
contemplation
of
various
objects
of
temptation
which
to
a
and
soldiery
were
irresistible
the
pursuit
was
forborne
the
americans
fastened
upon
the
liquors
and
refreshments
scattered
among
the
tents
and
the
whole
army
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
corps
then
fell
into
confusion
yet
so
closely
had
the
british
been
pursued
to
the
shelter
of
the
house
and
so
narrow
was
their
escape
that
some
of
the
americans
had
nearly
obtained
entrance
with
them
it
was
only
by
shutting
the
door
against
some
of
their
own
officers
that
they
made
it
secure
against
the
enemy
and
in
retiring
from
the
house
now
a
citadel
the
americans
only
found
safety
by
interposing
the
bodies
of
the
officers
thus
made
captive
at
the
entrance
between
themselves
and
the
fire
from
the
windows
one
ludicrous
incident
is
told
of
major
barry
who
was
taken
in
this
manner
and
made
use
of
as
a
shield
by
lieut
manning
as
he
retreated
from
before
the
house
which
otherwise
he
could
not
have
left
in
safety
without
struggling
or
making
the
slightest
effort
for
his
extrication
barry
only
enumerated
his
own
titles
with
a
profound
solemnity
sir

am
henry
barry

general
of

manning
you

i
was
looking
for

nothing
you
shall
screen
me
from
danger
and
i
shall
take
special
care
of
you
manning
escaped
in
safety
with
his
prisoner
but
there
were
many
brave
officers
far
less
fortunate
many
were
destined
to
perish
in
the
miserable
after
struggle
who
had
gone
gloriously
through
the
greater
dangers
of
the
fight
the
british
tents
had
done
what
the
british
arms
had
failed
to
do
victory
was
lost
to
the
americans
scattered
throughout
the
encampment
the
soldiers
became
utterly
unmanageable
the
enemy
meanwhile
had
partially
recovered
from
their
panic
the
party
of
sheridan
were
in
possession
of
the
house
another
party
held
possession
of
the
palisaded
garden
coffin
was
active
with
his
remnant
of
cavalry
and
marjoribanks
still
held
a
formidable
position
in
the
thicket
on
eutaw
creek
from
the
upper
windows
of
the
house
the
musketry
of
sheridan
traversed
the
encampment
which
the
americans
now
trembled
to
leave
lest
they
should
suffer
from
their
fire
every
head
that
emerged
from
a
tent
was
a
mark
for
their
bullets
aware
by
this
time
of
the
extent
of
his
misfortune
greene
ordered
a
retreat
which
hampton
cavalry
was
commanded
to
cover
in
the
execution
of
this
duty
hampton
encountered
the
british
cavalry
a
sharp
action
ensued
the
latter
fled
and
in
the
ardor
of
pursuit
the
american
horse
approached
so
near
to
the
position
of
marjoribanks
as
to
receive
a
murderous
fire
which
prostrated
of
their
number
and
scattered
the
rest
before
they
could
again
be
brought
together
marjoribanks
seizing
upon
the
chance
afforded
by
a
temporary
clearing
of
the
field
emerged
from
the
wood
at
a
moment
which
enabled
him
to
put
a
successful
finish
to
the
labors
of
the
day
two
which
had
been
abandoned
by
the
british
had
been
turned
upon
the
house
by
the
americans
but
in
their
eagerness
they
had
brought
the
pieces
within
the
range
of
fire
from
the
windows
of
the
house
the
artillerists
had
been
shot
down
and
in
the
absence
of
the
american
cavalry
marjoribanks
was
enabled
to
recover
them
wheeling
them
under
the
walls
of
the
house
he
took
a
contiguous
position
his
own
being
almost
the
only
portion
of
the
british
army
still
in
a
condition
to
renew
the
action
the
americans
yielded
the
ground
about
the
house
but
were
promptly
rallied
in
the
skirts
of
the
wood
the
british
were
too
much
crippled
to
pursue
and
the
respite
was
gladly
seized
upon
by
the
americans
to
plunge
headlong
into
the
neighboring
ponds
to
cool
the
heat
and
satisfy
the
intense
thirst
occasioned
by
such
efforts
under
the
burning
sun
of
a
carolina
september
both
sides
claimed
the
victory
and
with
equal
reason
in
the
first
part
of
the
day
it
was
clearly
with
the
americans
they
had
driven
the
enemy
from
the
field
in
panic
and
with
great
loss
they
were
in
possession
of
five
hundred
prisoners
nearly
all
of
whom
they
retained
they
had
taken
two
out
of
the
five
pieces
of
artillery
which
the
british
had
brought
into
the
action
and
something
more
to
boast
considering
the
proverbial
renown
of
the
british
with
this
weapon
it
was
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
that
they
had
swept
the
enemy
from
the
ground
the
british
took
shelter
in
a
fortress
from
which
the
americans
were
repulsed
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
assert
that
the
latter
might
have
taken
it
they
might
it
was
in
their
power
to
have
done
so
but
they
did
not
and
the
promptitude
with
which
the
british
availed
themselves
of
this
security
entitles
them
to
the
merit
which
they
claim
we
are
constrained
to
think
that
the
business
of
the
field
was
strangely
blundered
by
the
americans
at
the
sequel
this
may
have
arisen
from
the
carnage
made
at
this
period
among
their
officers
particularly
in
their
persevering
but
futile
endeavors
to
extricate
the
soldiers
from
their
tents
under
cover
of
a
contiguous
barn
the
artillery
presented
the
means
of
forcing
the
building
and
reducing
the
garrison
to
submission
the
attempts
made
at
this
object
by
this
arm
of
the
americans
were
rash
badly
counselled
and
exposed
to
danger
without
adequate
protection
the
british
were
saved
by
this
error
by
the
luxuries
contained
within
their
tents
by
the
spirited
behavior
of
coffin
and
the
cool
and
steady
valor
of
marjoribanks
chapter
retreat
of
the
british
from
eutaw
pursuit
of
them
by
marion
and
lee
close
of
the
year
that
the
results
of
victory
lay
with
the
americans
was
shown
by
the
events
of
the
ensuing
day
leaving
his
dead
unburied
seventy
of
his
wounded
to
the
enemy
breaking
up
a
thousand
stand
of
arms
and
destroying
his
stores
general
stewart
commenced
a
precipitate
retreat
towards
fairlawn
the
british
power
in
carolina
was
completely
prostrated
by
this
battle
five
hundred
prisoners
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
americans
and
it
was
greene
purpose
to
have
renewed
the
fight
on
the
next
day
but
the
flight
of
stewart
anticipated
and
baffled
his
intentions
he
commenced
pursuit
and
detached
marion
and
lee
by
a
circuitous
route
to
gain
the
enemy
front
and
interpose
themselves
between
him
and
the
post
at
fairlawn
from
which
major
had
been
summoned
with
five
hundred
men
to
cover
the
retreat
but
this
plan
was
unsuccessful
so
precipitate
was
the
march
of
stewart
and
so
happily
concerted
the
movements
of
the
two
british
officers
that
they
effected
a
junction
before
marion
and
lee
could
reach
ferguson
swamp
their
place
of
destination
the
cavalry
of
the
enemy
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
americans
but
stewart
was
beyond
pursuit
in
this
flight
amongst
others
the
british
lost
the
brave
major
marjoribanks
who
died
of
a
fever
and
was
buried
on
the
road
while
they
admitted
a
loss
in
killed
wounded
and
missing
of
half
the
number
brought
into
the
field
that
of
the
americans
was
nearly
equally
severe
and
fell
with
particular
severity
upon
the
officers
of
these
were
killed
or
wounded
died
upon
the
field
the
returns
exhibit
a
loss
of
one
hundred
and
fourteen
rank
and
file
killed
three
hundred
wounded
and
forty
missing
an
aggregate
exceeding
a
fourth
of
all
who
marched
into
battle
many
of
marion
men
were
killed
though
not
so
many
as
he
lost
in
the
affair
of
quinby
among
his
officers
capt
john
simons
of
pedee
was
slain
and
hugh
horry
wounded
greene
retired
to
the
high
hills
of
santee
while
marion
proceeded
to
encamp
at
payne
plantation
on
santee
river
swamp
this
was
one
of
his
favorite
places
of
retreat
here
in
the
depths
of
a
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
santee
he
made
himself
a
clearing
much
says
judge
james
to
his
liking
and
with
the
canes
thatched
the
rude
huts
of
his
men
the
high
land
was
skirted
by
lakes
which
rendered
the
approach
difficult
and
here
as
in
perfect
security
he
found
forage
for
his
horses
and
provisions
in
abundance
for
his
men
such
a
place
of
encampment
at
such
a
season
would
hardly
commend
itself
now
to
the
citizen
of
carolina
the
modes
and
objects
of
culture
and
probably
the
climate
have
undergone
a
change
the
time
was
autumn
the
most
sickly
period
of
our
year
and
to
sleep
in
such
a
region
now
even
for
a
single
night
would
be
considered
certain
death
to
the
white
man
it
does
not
seem
at
that
period
that
much
apprehension
of
malaria
was
felt
judge
james
refers
to
this
place
as
peyre
not
payne
plantation
and
notes
it
appears
now
there
was
very
little
sickness
at
that
day
in
a
footnote
he
goes
on
to
say
very
soon
after
the
revolutionary
war
this
scene
was
entirely
changed
planters
in
clearing
their
land
had
rolled
logs
and
other
rubbish
from
their
fields
into
the
lakes
and
creeks
leading
from
the
river
and
many
threw
trees
into
it
to
get
them
quickly
out
of
the
way
the
waters
below
being
obstructed
they
flooded
the
low
grounds
this
would
explain
the
early
absence
and
later
presence
of
malaria
as
the
mosquitoes
necessary
for
transmitting
it
would
thrive
in
the
still
waters
created
by
the
a
but
marion
did
not
linger
long
in
any
one
situation
hearing
that
the
british
were
about
to
send
their
wounded
from
fairlawn
to
charleston
his
restless
enterprise
prompted
him
to
aim
at
the
capture
of
the
detachment
moving
rapidly
by
night
he
threw
himself
below
the
former
place
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
and
would
certainly
have
intercepted
them
but
for
a
slave
of
one
of
the
plantations
who
hastening
to
the
british
camp
reported
his
proximity
the
arrival
of
a
superior
force
compelled
him
to
steal
away
with
a
caution
like
that
which
marked
his
approach
the
command
of
the
british
army
in
consequence
of
a
wound
received
by
general
stewart
at
eutaw
had
devolved
on
major
doyle
this
army
recruited
by
the
force
of
was
still
after
all
its
losses
fully
two
thousand
men
that
of
greene
reduced
by
wounds
and
sickness
could
not
muster
one
thousand
fit
for
duty
his
cavalry
had
been
greatly
thinned
by
the
late
battle
and
it
was
not
until
the
cavalry
of
brigade
could
be
brought
together
with
marion
mounted
infantry
and
the
horse
of
horry
and
mayham
that
the
superiority
of
the
american
general
could
be
restored
doyle
had
taken
post
at
fludd
plantation
three
miles
above
nelson
ferry
on
the
santee
with
the
main
body
of
the
british
held
the
post
at
fairlawn
with
a
detachment
of
three
hundred
doyle
with
some
instinctive
notion
that
his
time
was
short
busied
himself
in
a
career
of
plunder
which
threatened
to
strip
the
plantations
south
of
the
santee
and
congaree
and
westward
to
the
edisto
not
only
of
every
negro
which
they
contained
but
of
all
other
kinds
of
property
over
this
region
the
feebleness
of
the
american
forces
and
their
present
deficiency
in
cavalry
gave
him
almost
entire
control
the
opposite
banks
were
guarded
by
marion
and
hampton
who
afforded
protection
to
everything
that
could
be
moved
across
and
presented
themselves
at
every
point
to
the
enemy
whenever
he
attempted
the
passage
of
the
river
marion
was
at
this
time
an
invalid
but
however
much
he
might
need
he
asked
for
no
repose
or
exemption
from
service
when
the
enemy
was
in
the
field
his
force
was
also
reduced
by
sickness
mayham
alone
had
no
less
than
one
hundred
men
unfit
for
duty
other
circumstances
kept
the
militia
from
coming
to
the
summons
of
marion
those
on
the
borders
of
north
carolina
were
detained
to
meet
and
suppress
a
rising
of
the
loyalists
of
that
state
under
hector
and
even
those
in
his
camp
were
unprovided
with
ammunition
early
in
october
we
find
him
writing
pressingly
to
general
greene
and
governor
rutledge
for
a
supply
rutledge
answers
on
the
of
that
month
i
wish
to
god
it
was
in
my
power
to
send
you
ammunition
instantly
but
it
is
not
otho
williams
in
the
temporary
absence
of
greene
writes
in
answer
our
stock
of
ammunition
is
quite
exhausted
we
have
not
an
ounce
of
powder
or
a
cartridge
in
store
and
yet
it
was
under
similar
deficiencies
that
the
men
of
marion
had
labored
from
the
beginning
and
half
the
time
had
they
gone
into
battle
with
less
than
three
rounds
of
powder
to
a
man
williams
further
writes
his
excellency
governor
rutledge
has
intimated
that
you
meditate
an
expedition
over
the
santee
in
making
your
determination
if
it
is
not
settled
permit
me
to
recommend
to
your
consideration
that
the
general
depends
upon
you
entirely
for
intelligence
of
the
enemy
motions
the
activity
of
our
partisan
his
elasticity
of
character
his
independence
of
resources
and
usefulness
to
others
are
all
to
be
gathered
from
these
two
extracts
late
in
september
of
this
year
governor
rutledge
issued
a
proclamation
requiring
that
the
disaffected
should
come
in
within
thirty
days
and
perform
a
six
months
tour
of
duty
the
condition
of
pardon
for
all
previous
offences
was
attached
to
this
requisition
the
idea
of
this
proclamation
was
borrowed
from
similar
ones
of
the
british
generals
when
they
first
overran
the
country
the
object
was
to
secure
those
persons
of
whom
there
were
numbers
who
in
the
declining
fortunes
of
the
british
were
not
unwilling
to
turn
upon
and
rend
their
old
friends
no
longer
capable
of
protecting
or
providing
for
them
the
measure
was
of
doubtful
policy
since
it
appealed
to
the
basest
feelings
of
humanity
its
effects
were
considerable
however
numbers
presented
themselves
in
the
ranks
of
marion
showing
finely
in
contrast
with
his
ancient
and
veterans
their
new
white
feathers
says
james
fine
coats
new
saddles
and
bridles
and
famished
horses
showed
that
they
had
lately
been
in
the
british
garrison
their
appearance
not
to
speak
of
their
previous
career
naturally
inspired
distrust
in
the
minds
of
those
whose
scars
and
nakedness
were
the
proofs
of
their
virtue
and
another
measure
which
was
adopted
about
this
time
had
the
further
effect
of
impairing
the
value
of
that
efficient
brigade
upon
which
marion
had
been
accustomed
to
rely
in
order
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
new
regiments
it
was
permitted
to
all
such
persons
as
could
hire
a
substitute
to
claim
exemption
from
military
duty
this
was
a
temptation
too
great
to
be
resisted
by
those
old
soldiers
who
had
served
from
the
first
who
had
left
their
families
in
wretched
lodgings
in
poverty
and
distress
and
from
whose
immediate
neighborhood
the
presence
of
the
war
was
withdrawn
the
six
months
men
were
easily
bought
up
to
fill
their
places
the
result
was
very
injurious
to
the
of
the
brigade
and
the
evil
effects
of
the
measure
were
soon
felt
in
the
imperfect
subordination
the
deficient
firmness
and
the
unprincipled
character
of
the
new
recruits
it
was
productive
also
of
differences
between
two
of
marion
best
officers
horry
and
mayham
which
wrought
evil
consequences
to
the
country
being
commissioned
on
the
same
day
as
colonels
of
the
new
regiments
they
quarrelled
about
precedency
the
fruits
of
this
difference
will
be
seen
hereafter
as
the
winter
set
in
the
army
began
to
recruit
and
the
militia
to
embody
under
their
several
commanders
greene
was
joined
by
cols
shelby
and
sevier
with
five
hundred
mountaineers
and
these
with
horry
and
mayham
were
ordered
to
place
themselves
under
marion
to
operate
in
the
country
between
the
santee
and
charleston
sumter
at
the
same
time
with
a
brigade
of
state
troops
and
some
companies
of
militia
was
ordered
to
take
post
at
orangeburg
to
cover
the
country
from
the
inroads
of
the
loyalists
from
charleston
pickens
in
the
meantime
with
his
regiments
traversed
the
border
country
keeping
in
awe
the
indians
and
suppressing
the
predatory
movements
of
the
tories
about
the
november
the
separate
commands
of
marion
and
sumter
crossed
the
rivers
and
advanced
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
the
latter
soon
fell
in
with
cunningham
loyalists
in
force
and
found
it
prudent
to
fall
back
but
he
kept
cunningham
in
check
with
a
body
of
men
fully
equal
to
his
own
marion
also
was
compelled
to
come
to
a
halt
by
encountering
general
stewart
posted
at
wantoot
with
nearly
two
thousand
men
stewart
was
at
this
time
following
up
the
peculiar
labors
which
had
been
undertaken
by
major
doyle
when
in
temporary
charge
of
the
army
he
was
collecting
slaves
and
laying
in
provisions
preparing
for
siege
in
and
subsequent
flight
from
charleston
the
fall
of
cornwallis
at
yorktown
was
known
in
the
american
camp
on
the
of
november
it
had
been
anticipated
in
the
british
some
time
before
with
the
fate
of
that
commander
virtually
terminated
the
british
hope
of
the
country
and
the
proceedings
of
their
officers
in
the
south
as
elsewhere
looked
forward
to
the
approaching
necessity
of
flight
it
was
only
becoming
that
they
should
spoil
the
egyptians
previous
to
their
departure
the
capture
of
cornwallis
produced
a
jubilee
in
the
american
camp
in
that
of
marion
the
ladies
of
santee
were
permitted
to
partake
he
gave
them
a
fete
we
are
not
told
what
were
the
refreshments
at
the
house
of
john
cantey
the
general
says
james
was
not
very
susceptible
of
the
gentler
emotions
he
had
his
friends
and
was
kind
to
his
inferiors
but
his
mind
was
principally
absorbed
by
the
love
of
country
and
the
judge
rather
insinuates
that
the
pleasure
he
felt
on
this
occasion
arose
more
from
the
fall
of
cornwallis
than
from
the
presence
of
the
ladies
on
the
same
day
the
october
he
received
the
thanks
of
congress
for
his
wise
decided
and
gallant
conduct
in
defending
the
liberties
of
his
country
and
particularly
for
his
prudent
and
intrepid
attack
on
a
body
of
british
troops
on
the
august
last
and
for
the
distinguished
part
he
took
in
the
battle
of
the
september
this
date
is
given
in
both
simms
and
james
accounts
both
say
that
marion
received
the
thanks
of
congress
on
the
october
while
celebrating
the
defeat
of
cornwallis
but
cornwallis
was
defeated
on
the
of
that
month
this
date
should
probably
be
the
november
and
is
most
likely
a
repetition
of
james
a
on
the
november
the
camp
of
the
hills
was
broken
up
and
general
greene
advanced
with
his
army
to
the
four
holes
on
the
edisto
in
full
confidence
that
the
force
under
marion
would
be
adequate
to
keep
general
stewart
in
check
but
by
the
of
the
same
month
our
partisan
was
abandoned
by
all
the
mountaineers
under
shelby
and
sevier
a
force
of
five
hundred
men
this
was
after
a
three
weeks
service
this
miserable
defection
was
ascribed
to
the
withdrawal
of
shelby
from
the
army
on
leave
of
absence
but
in
all
probability
it
was
due
to
their
impatience
of
the
wary
sort
of
warfare
which
it
was
found
necessary
to
pursue
the
service
was
not
sufficiently
active
for
their
habits
marion
had
been
warned
that
he
must
keep
them
actively
employed
but
all
his
efforts
to
do
so
had
been
unsuccessful
he
had
approached
stewart
at
wantoot
but
though
the
force
of
the
latter
was
nominally
far
superior
to
that
of
the
partisan
he
could
not
be
drawn
out
of
his
encampment
this
was
a
subject
of
equal
surprise
and
chagrin
to
marion
subsequently
the
reason
of
this
timidity
on
the
part
of
the
british
general
was
discovered
a
return
found
on
an
who
fell
into
marion
hands
showed
that
out
of
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
men
stewart
had
nine
hundred
and
on
the
sick
list
the
only
services
in
which
the
mountaineers
were
employed
while
with
marion
were
in
attacks
on
the
post
at
fairlawn
and
the
redoubts
at
wappetaw
and
these
required
detachments
only
the
movement
against
the
latter
was
instantly
successful
the
enemy
abandoned
it
on
the
approach
of
the
americans
but
the
post
at
fairlawn
was
of
more
value
in
better
condition
of
defence
a
convenient
depot
and
being
in
the
rear
of
the
british
army
then
stationed
at
wantoot
promised
a
stout
resistance
the
american
detachment
against
this
place
was
led
by
mayham
in
passing
the
post
at
wantoot
he
was
ordered
to
show
himself
and
if
possible
to
decoy
the
british
cavalry
into
the
field
the
manoeuvre
did
not
succeed
but
it
brought
out
a
strong
detachment
which
followed
close
upon
his
heels
and
required
that
what
he
should
undertake
should
be
done
quickly
on
approaching
fairlawn
he
found
everything
prepared
for
defence
he
lost
no
time
in
making
his
advances
a
part
of
his
riflemen
were
dismounted
and
acting
as
infantry
approached
the
abbatis
while
his
cavalry
advanced
boldly
and
demanded
a
surrender
the
place
with
all
its
sick
three
hundred
stand
of
arms
and
eighty
convalescents
was
yielded
at
discretion
with
these
small
affairs
ended
the
service
of
the
mountaineers
in
marion
army
they
retired
to
their
native
hills
leaving
marion
and
greene
enmeshed
in
difficulties
it
was
on
the
strength
of
this
force
chiefly
that
the
latter
had
descended
from
the
hills
and
he
was
now
unable
to
recede
marion
too
relying
upon
their
support
had
crossed
the
santee
and
placed
himself
in
close
proximity
on
the
right
of
the
enemy
but
the
feebleness
and
timidity
of
stewart
and
his
ignorance
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
marion
camp
saved
these
generals
from
the
necessity
of
a
retreat
which
would
have
been
equally
full
of
danger
and
humiliation
the
movement
of
greene
across
the
congaree
induced
him
to
draw
towards
charleston
and
marion
was
left
in
safety
the
timidity
shown
by
the
enemy
encouraged
greene
and
dispatching
a
select
party
of
horse
under
wade
hampton
he
followed
hard
upon
their
steps
with
as
many
chosen
infantry
his
purpose
was
the
surprise
of
dorchester
stewart
was
descending
to
the
city
by
another
route
hampton
advance
fell
in
with
a
reconnoitring
party
of
fifty
men
and
suffered
few
to
escape
and
though
greene
did
not
succeed
in
surprising
the
post
at
dorchester
his
approach
had
the
effect
of
producing
its
abandonment
during
the
night
the
garrison
destroyed
everything
threw
their
cannon
into
the
river
and
retreated
to
charleston
greene
did
not
venture
to
pursue
as
the
enemy
infantry
exceeded
five
hundred
men
meanwhile
stewart
had
hurried
on
by
goose
creek
bridge
and
joining
the
fugitives
from
dorchester
halted
at
the
quarter
house
and
prepared
to
encounter
the
whole
army
of
greene
which
in
their
panic
was
supposed
to
be
upon
their
heels
such
was
the
alarm
in
charleston
that
general
leslie
who
now
succeeded
stewart
proceeded
to
embody
the
slaves
in
arms
for
the
defence
of
that
place
a
measure
which
was
soon
repented
of
and
almost
as
soon
abandoned
greene
fell
back
upon
his
main
army
which
had
now
advanced
to
plantation
on
the
round
while
marion
pressing
nearer
to
charleston
kept
the
right
of
the
enemy
in
check
the
movements
of
our
partisan
were
left
to
his
own
discretion
greene
in
all
cases
not
only
suffers
the
judgment
of
the
former
to
determine
for
himself
his
course
giving
him
a
thoroughly
independent
command
but
he
betrays
the
most
respectful
desire
on
frequent
occasions
to
have
his
opinion
thus
on
the
of
november
he
writes
to
him
sumter
has
orders
to
take
post
at
orangeburgh
to
prevent
the
tories
in
that
quarter
from
conveying
supplies
to
town
and
his
advanced
parties
will
penetrate
as
low
as
dorchester
therefore
you
may
act
in
conjunction
with
him
or
employ
your
troops
on
the
enemy
left
as
you
may
find
from
information
they
can
be
best
employed
please
to
give
me
your
opinion
on
which
side
they
can
be
most
useful
on
the
of
the
same
month
he
writes
again
you
are
at
liberty
to
act
as
you
think
advisedly
i
have
no
particular
instructions
to
give
you
and
only
wish
you
to
avoid
surprise
the
latter
caution
to
a
soldier
of
marion
character
and
prudence
was
scarcely
necessary
but
he
was
so
near
the
enemy
and
the
latter
in
such
superior
force
that
the
suggestion
on
the
part
of
greene
was
only
natural
where
greene
himself
lay
two
rivers
ran
between
his
army
and
that
of
the
british
without
ammunition
himself
and
informed
of
reinforcements
which
the
enemy
had
received
to
preserve
a
respectful
distance
between
them
was
on
the
part
of
the
american
commander
only
a
becoming
caution
it
was
now
december
and
the
troops
both
of
greene
and
marion
were
without
the
necessary
clothing
they
had
neither
cloaks
nor
blankets
on
the
of
that
month
greene
received
a
supply
of
ammunition
all
of
which
he
sent
to
marion
no
small
proof
of
the
confidence
which
he
felt
that
in
such
hands
it
would
not
be
thrown
away
thus
closed
the
campaign
of
by
manoeuvre
and
a
successful
combination
of
events
the
british
troops
had
been
driven
down
the
country
and
restrained
within
the
narrow
neck
of
land
contiguous
to
charleston
the
encampment
of
the
main
army
continued
at
the
round
marion
was
at
watboo
on
cooper

the

wilkinson
watched
the
movements

the
south
between
charleston
and

and
lee
posted
in

with
a
light
detachment
kept
him
from
prying
into
the
real
weakness
of
the
american
army
in
the
ignorance
of
the
british
general
lay
the
security
of
the
american
for
at
this
particular
time
there
were
not
eight
hundred
men
at
greene
headquarters
a
glance
at
any
map
of
south
carolina
will
show
the
judgment
with
which
these
several
posts
were
taken
at
once
for
easy
cooperation
of
the
americans
as
for
the
control
of
all
the
country
above
the
positions
actually
held
by
the
british
the
territory
of
the
state
with
the
exception
of
that
neck
of
land
which
lies
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
up
from
charleston
between
the
approaching
rivers
ashley
and
cooper
had
all
been
recovered
from
the
enemy
but
the
necessities
of
the
americans
the
want
of
military
the
thinness
of
the
regiments
and
the
increasing
strength
of
the
british
derived
from
foreign
troops
and
accessions
from
other
posts
in
america
left
it
doubtful
under
existing
circumstances
whether
it
could
be
long
retained
but
this
misgiving
was
not
allowed
to
prejudice
or
impair
the
popular
hope
resulting
from
the
apparent
successes
of
their
arms
and
one
of
the
modes
adopted
for
contributing
to
this
conviction
was
the
formal
restoration
of
the
native
civil
authority
the
members
of
the
state
assembly
of
whom
marion
was
one
were
accordingly
required
by
the
proclamation
of
governor
rutledge
who
had
held
almost
dictatorial
powers
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
to
convene
at
jacksonborough
at
an
early
day
of
the
ensuing

conspiracy
in
the
camp
of
greene
while
the
army
of
greene
lay
at
round
considerable
alarm
was
excited
in
the
american
camp
by
tidings
of
large
reinforcements
made
to
the
british
strength
in
charleston
general
leslie
was
now
in
command
of
the
latter
the
contraction
of
the
american
military
had
very
greatly
straitened
the
resources
and
comforts
of
the
british
general
the
numerous
refugees
who
had
taken
shelter
in
the
city
with
their
families
the
great
accumulation
of
horses
within
the
lines
and
the
vigilant
watch
which
was
maintained
over
the
islands
and
the
neck
by
the
american
light
detachments
soon
contributed
to
lessen
the
stock
of
provisions
in
the
capital
and
to
cut
off
its
supplies
one
consequence
of
this
condition
was
to
compel
leslie
to
put
two
hundred
of
his
horses
to
death
while
by
all
other
possible
means
he
collected
his
provisions
from
the
surrounding
country
considerable
parties
were
kept
upon
the
alert
for
this
object
and
to
facilitate
the
movements
of
these
parties
strong
posts
were
established
at
haddrel
point
and
hobcaw
the
situation
of
these
posts
on
the
extremities
of
tongues
of
land
to
which
assistance
might
easily
be
conveyed
by
water
and
from
which
retreat
to
an
attacking
enemy
was
difficult
rendered
them
comparatively
safe
for
the
present
against
the
americans
but
the
situation
of
leslie
was
one
of
uncomfortable
constraint
and
it
was
natural
that
he
should
avail
himself
of
any
prospect
which
might
promise
him
relief
it
was
readily
believed
therefore
in
the
american
camp
that
with
the
acquisition
of
new
strength
by
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
from
abroad
leslie
would
seek
to
break
through
the
cordon
put
around
him
the
rumor
of
his
approach
in
strength
caused
greene
to
issue
his
orders
to
marion
to
repair
to
headquarters
with
all
the
force
he
could
draw
after
him
our
partisan
promptly
obeyed
the
summons
but
on
his
way
to
join
with
greene
he
left
a
detachment
of
mounted
infantry
in
the
neighborhood
of
monk
corner
to
watch
the
motions
of
the
enemy
but
leslie
purpose
was
mistaken
his
strength
had
been
exaggerated
he
had
no
designs
upon
the
camp
of
greene
being
no
doubt
quite
as
ignorant
of
his
weakness
as
the
latter
was
of
the
british
strength
but
the
detachment
left
by
marion
near
monk
corner
caught
the
attention
of
the
enemy
and
in
the
absence
of
the
partisan
it
was
thought
accessible
to
a
proper
attempt
from
charleston
in
all
the
movements
of
the
british
it
is
very
evident
that
they
attached
no
small
importance
to
the
presence
of
this
chief
a
detachment
of
three
hundred
men
cavalry
and
infantry
was
transported
by
water
to
the
north
bank
of
the
wando
river
this
body
moved
with
equal
secrecy
and
celerity
but
they
were
disappointed
in
their
aim
marion
had
returned
from
the
continental
camp
to
his
own
the
storm
which
threatened
the
former
was
overblown
and
he
was
in
season
to
avert
that
by
which
the
latter
was
threatened
his
force
was
scarcely
equal
to
that
of
the
enemy
he
nevertheless
resolved
upon
attacking
them
in
order
to
keep
them
in
play
while
he
advanced
with
his
main
body
cols
richardson
and
scriven
with
a
part
of
mayham
horse
were
dispatched
with
orders
to
throw
themselves
in
front
of
the
british
and
engage
them
until
he
could
come
up
this
order
was
gallantly
executed
they
encountered
the
enemy
advance
near
the
of
thomas
charged
them
vigorously
and
succeeded
in
putting
them
to
flight
with
some
slaughter
capt
campbell
of
the
british
and
several
others
were
killed
but
the
pursuit
was
urged
too
far
the
cavalry
of
mayham
by
which
this
success
had
been
obtained
was
of
new
organization
their
training
had
been
partial
only
it
was
seen
that
though
they
drove
the
british
horse
before
them
their
own
charge
was
marked
by
disorder
hurried
forward
by
success
they
rushed
into
the
jaws
of
danger
and
were
only
brought
to
their
senses
by
an
encounter
with
the
whole
of
the
british
infantry
a
volley
from
this
body
drove
them
back
in
confusion
while
the
cavalry
which
had
been
flying
before
them
encouraged
by
the
presence
of
the
infantry
rallied
upon
the
steps
of
the
pursuers
and
drove
them
in
turn
they
suffered
severely
wedged
upon
a
narrow
causeway
which
gave
them
as
little
room
for
escape
as
evolution
fell
upon
the
spot
by
the
fire
of
the
infantry
the
rest
were
rallied
when
sufficiently
far
from
the
more
formidable
enemy
and
turning
upon
the
british
cavalry
once
more
put
them
to
flight
but
the
event
left
marion
too
weak
to
press
the
encounter
he
contented
himself
with
watching
the
motions
of
the
british
and
they
were
sufficiently
respectful
not
to
press
him
to
any
less
pacific
performance
they
were
satisfied
to
pursue
their
march
and
gathering
a
few
head
of
cattle
to
retire
to
haddrell
foregoing
the
more
important
object
of
their
incursion
the
field
clear
marion
left
his
brigade
in
charge
of
horry
and
repaired
to
jacksonborough
to
attend
the
assembly
to
which
he
had
been
elected
a
member
from
john
berkeley
the
same
parish
which
he
represented
in
the
provincial
congress
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
this
was
early
in
the
year
the
legislature
met
at
jacksonborough
a
little
village
on
the
edisto
or
river
on
the
january
of
this
year
this
position
almost
within
striking
distance
of
the
british
army
at
charleston
was
chosen
with
particular
reference
to
the
moral
influence
which
the
boldness
of
such
a
choice
would
be
likely
to
have
upon
the
people
and
the
confidence
which
it
seemed
to
declare
in
the
ability
of
the
american
army
to
render
the
place
secure
to
make
it
so
greene
moved
his
troops
across
the
edisto
and
took
post
at
skirving
plantation
six
miles
in
advance
of
jacksonborough
and
on
the
road
which
leads
to
charleston
there
was
yet
another
step
necessary
to
this
object
the
british
in
addition
to
charleston
and
the
neck
held
possession
of
two
islands
james
and
john
which
belong
to
that
inner
chain
of
isles
which
stretches
along
the
coast
from
charleston
to
savannah
separated
from
the
main
by
creeks
and
marshes
and
from
one
another
by
the
estuaries
of
rivers
sounds
or
inlets
on
john
island
which
is
fertile
extensive
and
secure
the
enemy
held
a
very
respectable
force
under
craig
jacksonborough
was
within
striking
distance
of
this
force
it
could
be
approached
by
boats
or
galleys
in
a
single
tide
it
was
equally
assailable
from
this
point
by
land
as
a
matter
of
precaution
it
was
considered
necessary
to
disperse
this
force
and
it
was
soon
ascertained
not
only
that
the
island
was
accessible
but
that
the
enemy
relying
upon
the
protection
of
his
armed
galleys
was
unapprehensive
of
attack
the
attempt
was
entrusted
to
cols
lee
and
laurens
who
with
separate
parties
were
to
reach
the
point
of
destination
by
different
routes
one
of
the
parties
lost
the
road
and
failed
to
cooperate
with
the
other
the
movement
was
only
partially
successful
a
second
was
designed
and
succeeded
the
galleys
were
driven
from
their
station
by
the
artillery
and
laurens
penetrated
to
craig
encampment
but
the
latter
had
already
abandoned
it
a
few
stragglers
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
americans
but
nothing
more
the
preceding
attempt
had
just
sufficed
to
convince
craig
of
the
insecurity
of
the
place
and
he
had
taken
timely
precautions
against
suffering
from
a
repetition
of
the
attempt
the
legislature
assembled
according
to
appointment
the
proclamation
of
the
governor
to
whom
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
had
been
accorded
almost
dictatorial
powers
precluded
from
election
and
suffrage
all
persons
who
had
taken
british
protections
and
as
those
who
were
true
to
the
state
had
been
very
generally
active
in
the
ranks
of
her
military
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
a
great
proportion
of
the
members
were
military
men
among
these
were
sumter
and
marion
the
former
about
this
time
yielded
his
commission
to
the
authorities
on
account
of
some
slight
or
injustice
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
and
left
the
army
when
he
took
his
seat
in
the
assembly
general
henderson
succeeded
to
his
command
the
jacksonborough
assembly
was
highly
distinguished
as
well
for
its
talent
as
for
its
worth
and
patriotism
its
character
was
perhaps
rather
military
than
civil
constituting
as
they
did
in
a
slave
community
a
sort
of
feudal
aristocracy
and
accustomed
as
for
so
long
a
time
they
had
been
to
the
use
of
the
weapons
of
war
its
members
wore
the
deportment
of
so
many
armed
barons
gathered
together
quite
as
much
for
action
as
resolve
it
was
not
only
unavoidable
but
highly
important
at
this
juncture
that
such
should
be
the
character
of
this
body
who
could
so
well
determine
what
were
the
necessities
of
the
country
what
the
exigencies
of
the
people
what
the
local
resources
and
remedies
as
those
who
had
fought
its
battles
traversed
every
acre
of
its
soil
and
represented
its
interests
and
maintained
its
rights
when
there
was
no
civil
authority
what
legislators
so
likely
to
wield
the
popular
will
as
men
who
like
marion
and
sumter
had
become
its
rallying
leaders
whom
the
people
had
been
accustomed
to
obey
and
follow
and
by
whom
they
had
been
protected
it
was
equally
important
that
the
legislation
should
come
from
such
sources
when
we
consider
the
effect
upon
the
enemy
still
having
a
foothold
in
the
state
they
might
reasonably
apprehend
that
the
laws
springing
from
such
a
body
would
be
marked
by
a
stern
directness
and
decision
of
purpose
which
would
leave
nothing
to
be
hoped
by
disaffection
or
hostility
and
their
proceedings
did
not
disappoint
the
expectations
of
friend
or
foe
the
measures
of
this
assembly
were
marked
by
equal
prudence
and
resolve
they
passed
a
new
act
respecting
the
militia
and
one
for
raising
the
state
quota
of
continental
troops
one
of
their
measures
has
been
questioned
as
unwise
and
impolitic
that
namely
for
amercing
and
confiscating
the
estates
of
certain
of
the
loyalists
and
for
banishing
the
most
obnoxious
among
them
something
certainly
is
to
be
said
in
favor
of
this
act
if
vindictive
it
seems
to
have
been
necessary
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
consequence
of
a
previous
proclamation
of
the
governor
none
but
the
most
implacable
and
virulent
of
the
tories
were
liable
to
its
operation
none
but
those
who
had
rejected
very
liberal
offers
of
indulgence
and
conciliation
this
proclamation
had
opened
the
door
to
reconciliation
with
the
state
on
very
easy
terms
to
the
offenders
it
gave
them
timely
warning
to
come
in
enrol
themselves
in
the
american
ranks
and
thus
assure
themselves
of
that
protection
and
safety
which
they
had
well
forfeited
their
neglect
or
refusal
to
accept
this
proffer
of
mercy
properly
incurred
the
penalties
of
contumacy
these
penalties
could
be
no
other
than
confiscation
of
property
and
banishment
of
person
reasons
of
policy
if
not
of
absolute
necessity
seemed
to
enforce
these
penalties
how
was
the
war
to
be
carried
on
marion
men
for
example
received
no
pay
no
food
no
clothing
they
had
borne
the
dangers
and
the
toils
of
war
not
only
without
pay
but
without
the
hope
of
it
they
had
done
more
they
had
yielded
up
their
private
fortunes
to
the
cause
they
had
seen
their
plantations
stripped
by
the
enemy
of
negroes
horses
cattle
provisions
plate
everything
in
short
which
could
tempt
the
appetite
of
cupidity
and
this
too
with
the
knowledge
not
only
that
numerous
loyalists
had
been
secured
in
their
own
possessions
but
had
been
rewarded
out
of
theirs
the
proposed
measure
seemed
but
a
natural
and
necessary
compliance
with
popular
requisition
besides
the
war
was
yet
to
be
carried
on
how
was
this
to
be
done
how
long
was
it
yet
to
last
what
was
to
be
its
limit
who
could
predict
congress
was
without
money
the
state
without
means
for
a
space
of
three
years
south
carolina
had
not
only
supported
the
war
within
but
beyond
her
own
borders
georgia
was
utterly
destitute
and
was
indebted
to
south
carolina
for
eighteen
months
for
her
subsistence
and
north
carolina
in
the
portions
contiguous
to
south
carolina
was
equally
poor
and
disaffected
the
whigs
were
utterly
impoverished
by
their
own
wants
and
the
ravages
of
the
enemy
they
had
nothing
more
to
give
patriotism
could
now
bestow
little
but
its
blood
it
was
with
an
obvious
propriety
resolved
by
the
jacksonborough
assembly
that
those
who
had
proved
false
to
the
country
should
be
made
to
suffer
in
like
degree
with
those
who
had
been
true
and
who
were
still
suffering
in
her
defence
as
a
measure
of
prolonged
policy
contemplated
beyond
the
emergency
there
may
be
objections
to
the
confiscation
act
but
the
necessities
of
the
time
seemed
to
demand
it
and
it
will
be
difficult
for
any
judgment
having
before
it
all
the
particulars
of
the
cruel
civil
war
through
which
the
country
had
gone
not
to
speak
of
the
army
and
the
present
and
pressing
necessity
for
maintaining
it
to
arrive
at
any
other
conclusion
or
to
censure
the
brave
men
who
urged
and
advocated
the
measure
the
proceeding
seems
perfectly
defensible
on
general
principles
though
in
particular
instances
as
in
the
application
of
all
general
principles
it
may
have
been
productive
of
injury
the
estates
of
the
loyalists
by
this
measure
were
seized
upon
as
a
means
for
building
up
the
credit
of
the
state
supplying
it
with
the
necessary
funds
for
maintaining
order
as
well
as
war
and
for
requiting
and
supporting
that
army
which
was
still
required
to
bleed
in
its
defence
what
part
was
taken
in
this
act
by
marion
is
not
known
though
kind
and
indulgent
in
his
nature
he
was
stern
and
resolute
in
war
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
entertained
any
scruples
about
a
proceeding
the
necessity
of
which
at
the
time
seems
to
have
been
beyond
all
dispute
the
absence
of
our
partisan
from
his
brigade
was
almost
fatal
to
it
he
left
it
with
reluctance
and
only
with
the
conviction
that
his
presence
in
the
senate
was
important
to
the
interests
equally
of
the
army
and
the
country
indeed
without
him
there
would
not
have
been
a
quorum
there
were
only
thirteen
senators
present
he
was
interested
besides
in
the
passage
of
the
new
militia
act
and
in
one
designed
to
raise
the
state
quota
of
continental
troops
these
were
sufficient
to
compel
his
presence
but
he
remained
with
reluctance
his
letters
from
jacksonborough
betray
the
most
constant
anxiety
about
his
brigade
he
had
yielded
it
to
horry
with
the
most
earnest
exhortations
to
caution
by
his
orders
the
latter
the
more
completely
to
ensure
its
safety
removed
to
a
position
on
the
north
side
of
wambaw
a
creek
emptying
into
the
santee
here
in
an
angle
formed
by
the
two
roads
which
pass
from
lenud
ferry
road
to
horry
plantation
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
bridge
horry
occupied
a
post
which
caution
might
have
rendered
safe
in
his
rear
was
a
wood
his
newly
raised
regiment
not
half
complete
lay
at
durant
plantation
about
a
mile
above
under
the
command
of
major
benson
horry
does
not
seem
to
have
been
remiss
in
his
duties
but
about
this
time
he
fell
sick
and
for
some
time
before
he
had
been
and
still
was
somewhat
wilful
there
was
an
unhappy
dispute
between
himself
and
mayham
touching
rank
and
precedence
the
latter
refused
to
be
commanded
by
the
former
claiming
to
be
equal
in
commission
and
when
marion
went
to
jacksonborough
separated
his
corps
from
the
brigade
posted
them
higher
up
the
river
and
being
a
member
of
the
legislature
proceeded
to
jacksonborough
also
greene
was
not
unwilling
in
the
present
juncture
of
affairs
that
the
native
officers
should
be
present
at
the
deliberations
of
this
body
the
civil
objects
were
just
then
even
more
important
than
the
military
the
contumacy
of
mayham
was
a
subject
of
the
most
earnest
discussion
both
marion
and
greene
decided
against
him
yet
both
were
reluctant
to
offend
him
as
they
knew
his
value
as
a
cavalry
officer
mayham
seems
to
have
acted
under
some
erroneous
impressions
of
the
independence
of
a
legionary
brigade
as
he
claimed
his
to
be
he
also
complained
of
the
free
use
which
marion
made
of
his
cavalry
and
the
severe
duties
he
was
required
to
perform
to
this
greene
replies
you
are
to
consider
how
extensive
the
country
he
has
to
guard
and
how
much
he
depends
upon
your
corps
this
will
account
for
the
hard
service
you
have
been
put
to
the
general
is
a
good
man
and
when
you
consider
his
difficulties
and
make
just
allowances
perhaps
you
will
have
little
to
complain
of
but
the
hard
necessity
of
the
service
but
this
reply
did
not
produce
its
effect
and
mayham
certainly
erred
as
a
soldier
in
complaining
of
the
severity
of
his
tasks
in
the
old
chivalrous
periods
the
peculiar
severity
of
the
duties
assigned
to
knighthood
was
recognized
gratefully
as
a
matter
of
compliment
and
trust
he
still
held
off
and
marion
promptly
demanded
that
if
mayham
had
any
independent
right
of
command
while
nominally
under
him
he
might
be
at
once
withdrawn
from
the
brigade
mayham
manner
and
tone
were
quite
respectful
but
tenacious
and
while
the
discussion
was
in
progress
and
he
holding
off
from
horry
events
were
brewing
which
were
destined
to
terminate
the
unfortunate
dispute
by
a
capital
misfortune
again
taking
advantage
of
the
absence
of
marion
an
expedition
was
set
on
foot
in
charleston
against
horry
a
detachment
of
two
hundred
horse
five
hundred
infantry
and
two
pieces
of
artillery
under
thomson
better
known
in
as
count
rumford
prepared
to
ascend
cooper
river
its
preparations
were
not
conducted
with
such
caution
however
but
that
they
became
known
to
the
vigilant
friends
of
the
americans
in
and
about
the
city
the
army
was
warned
of
their
preparations
greene
hinted
to
marion
the
necessity
of
returning
to
his
command
the
latter
replies
by
declaring
his
great
anxiety
to
do
so
but
urges
the
impossibility
of
leaving
the
senate
lest
the
assembly
should
be
broken
up
an
event
which
might
be
of
fatal
importance
to
the
cause
unless
the
great
business
of
the
session
were
first
disposed
of
he
promises
to
move
as
soon
as
this
should
be
the
case
the
actual
movement
of
the
british
detachment
made
it
impossible
that
marion
should
longer
delay
to
rejoin
his
brigade
and
accompanied
by
mayham
he
reached
the
ground
on
which
the
regiment
of
the
latter
was
encamped
by
a
circuitous
route
and
rapid
riding
on
the
february
here
they
were
unhappily
told
that
the
enemy
was
retiring
marion
accordingly
remained
to
rest
and
refresh
himself
while
mayham
paid
a
visit
to
his
own
plantation
in
a
few
hours
after
mayham
departure
an
express
arrived
with
the
mortifying
intelligence
that
the
brigade
had
been
surprised
and
dispersed
marion
instantly
putting
himself
at
the
head
of
mayham
regiment
hurried
on
toward
wambaw
the
scene
of
the
event
to
check
pursuit
and
collect
and
save
the
fugitives
we
have
seen
the
position
of
horry
he
had
sent
out
his
scouts
on
all
the
roads
by
which
the
approach
of
an
enemy
might
be
apprehended
feeling
himself
secure
and
being
sick
he
went
over
the
river
on
the
the
day
of
the
catastrophe
to
his
plantation
leaving
the
brigade
under
the
command
of
major
benson
as
will
be
remembered
held
a
position
with
the
incomplete
regiment
of
horry
at
plantation
about
a
mile
above
that
of
the
brigade
by
some
unaccountable
remissness
of
patrols
or
videttes
the
british
cavalry
under
coffin
surprised
the
latter
post
benson
it
is
said
had
been
told
by
capt
bennett
who
commanded
the
scouts
in
thomas
that
the
enemy
was
approaching
but
the
information
was
brought
to
him
while
at
dinner
and
a
keen
appetite
made
him
slow
to
believe
tidings
which
might
have
lessened
the
enjoyment
of
the
meal
bennett
proceeded
to
horry
headquarters
where
happened
to
be
at
dinner
also
he
proved
equally
incredulous
but
desired
major
james
who
had
just
arrived
in
camp
to
take
command
of
his
regiment
the
surprise
of
benson
was
complete
and
he
paid
for
his
remissness
or
indifference
with
his
life
the
firing
at
durant
convinced
of
his
error
but
in
all
probability
the
surprise
was
quite
as
complete
in
the
one
command
as
in
the
other
there
were
two
regiments
of
men
that
is
to
say
reformed
tories
persons
who
had
come
in
under
the
proclamation
issued
by
governor
rutledge
these
broke
at
the
first
encounter
with
the
enemy
in
their
flight
and
to
prevent
pursuit
they
threw
off
the
planks
from
wambaw
bridge
fortunately
a
strong
body
under
major
james
checked
the
pursuit
for
a
space
and
gave
an
opportunity
for
the
fugitives
to
save
themselves
many
of
them
crossed
the
river
by
swimming
but
some
were
drowned
in
the
attempt
the
thickets
saved
the
infantry
no
prisoners
were
taken
the
british
gave
no
quarter
successful
against
benson
and
the
enemy
pressed
forward
in
the
direction
of
marion
approach
but
without
having
any
knowledge
of
his
proximity
he
had
halted
with
the
cavalry
of
mayham
at
the
house
of
tydiman
about
four
miles
from
the
scene
of
the
disaster
to
refresh
his
men
and
horses
the
latter
were
unbitted
and
feeding
when
the
whole
of
the
enemy
cavalry
made
their
appearance
it
would
seem
from
the
indecision
of
their
commander
that
he
was
no
less
surprised
at
falling
in
with
this
body
of
marion
men
than
was
our
partisan
at
his
sudden
appearance
his
hesitation
under
this
surprise
gave
the
americans
an
opportunity
to
recover
themselves
it
was
the
opinion
of
mayham
that
had
the
charge
been
sounded
the
moment
that
he
came
in
view
the
whole
regiment
must
have
been
lost
there
was
no
retreat
save
by
the
river
and
by
the
lane
through
which
they
had
entered
the
plantation
and
of
this
the
enemy
had
full
command
the
halt
and
hesitation
of
the
british
their
seeming
alarm
at
once
afforded
marion
the
means
of
extrication
from
his
predicament
to
bit
and
mount
their
horses
was
for
his
cavalry
the
work
of
a
moment
though
not
counting
half
the
numbers
of
the
enemy
marion
instant
resolution
was
to
issue
forth
by
the
lane
and
attack
them
they
had
displayed
themselves
in
front
of
it
just
before
the
lane
was
an
old
field
and
a
little
to
the
right
a
pond
of
water
marion
placing
a
small
body
of
infantry
to
great
advantage
along
the
fence
ordered
his
column
of
cavalry
to
advance
through
the
lane
to
the
attack
his
men
were
well
mounted
in
this
respect
if
inferior
in
numbers
they
had
a
manifest
advantage
over
the
british
the
latter
had
been
too
long
cooped
up
in
the
walls
of
charleston
on
short
commons
to
be
very
serviceable
and
the
cavalry
of
mayham
though
somewhat
too
much
crowded
with
the
whigs
were
yet
confident
from
long
experience
in
their
ability
to
contend
with
the
enemy
marion
himself
was
confident
but
was
destined
in
this
instance
to
lose
what
he
himself
in
his
dispatches
has
styled
a
glorious
opportunity
of
cutting
up
the
british
cavalry
his
men
moved
to
the
extremity
of
the
lane
before
which
the
enemy
had
halted
with
a
firm
and
promising
countenance
the
front
section
was
led
by
capt
smith
an
officer
of
approved
courage
who
in
a
very
recent
affair
at
thomas
had
signally
distinguished
himself
yet
seized
with
a
sudden
panic
the
moment
that
he
reached
the
end
of
the
lane
he
dashed
into
the
woods
on
the
right
and
drew
after
him
the
whole
regiment
marion
himself
who
was
near
the
head
of
the
column
was
borne
away
by
the
torrent
which
he
in
vain
struggled
to
withstand
the
rush
was
irresistible
the
confusion
irretrievable
all
efforts
to
restrain
or
recover
the
fugitives
were
idle
until
they
had
reached
the
woods
there
marion
succeeded
in
rallying
a
party
and
at
this
point
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
was
checked
and
the
fugitives
partly
rallied
they
had
sustained
but
little
loss
in
lives
but
the
shame
the
disgrace
of
such
a
panic
were
immeasurably
humiliating
the
british
showed
no
eagerness
in
the
pursuit
they
seemed
to
doubt
the
bloodless
victory
which
they
had
won
and
content
with
their
own
escape
were
not
unreasonably
urgent
with
fortune
to
make
their
victory
complete
they
subsequently
after
they
had
fully
recovered
from
their
panic
contrived
greatly
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
the
event
one
of
the
newspapers
of
the
day
has
the
following
things
bear
a
better
prospect
than
they
did
colonel
thomson
has
defeated
general
marion
in
south
carolina
killed
one
hundred
men
and
marion
was
drowned
attempting
to
escape
the
only
officer
drowned
in
the
flight
was
lieut
smyzer
of
cavalry
the
loss
of
the
brigade
in
horses
and
accoutrements
was
greater
than
in
men
their
greater
loss
however
was
of
that
confidence
in
themselves
and
one
another
which
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
objects
of
training
to
inspire
the
true
secret
of
the
superiority
of
regulars
over
lies
in
the
habit
of
mutual
reliance
they
feel
each
elbows
in
military
parlance
they
are
assured
by
the
custom
of
mutually
depending
one
upon
the
other
this
habit
impresses
them
with
a
conviction
which
the
terrors
of
conflict
do
not
often
impair
that
they
will
not
be
deserted
and
thus
assured
they
hurry
into
the
battle
and
remain
in
it
so
long
as
the
body
with
which
they
move
can
act
together
once
broken
however
the
cry
is
qui
peut
not
so
with
they
never
forget
their
individuality
the
very
feeling
of
personal
independence
is
apt
to
impair
their
confidence
in
one
another
their
habit
is
to
obey
the
individual
impulse
they
do
not
wait
to
take
their
temper
from
their
neighbor
right
and
left
hence
their
irregularity
the
difficulty
of
restraining
them
of
making
them
act
in
routine
and
with
entire
reference
to
the
action
of
other
bodies
so
far
from
deriving
strength
from
feeling
another
elbow
they
much
prefer
elbow
room
could
they
be
assured
of
one
another
they
were
the
greatest
troops
in
the
world
they
are
the
greatest
troops
in
the
world
capable
of
the
most
daring
and
heroic
achievements
wherever
the
skill
of
the
commander
can
inspire
this
feeling
of
mutual
reliance
frequent
cooperation
of
the
same
persons
under
the
same
leader
produces
it
and
makes
them
veterans
the
old
soldiers
of
the
brigade
had
it
in
perfection
it
was
one
of
the
excellences
of
marion
that
it
followed
so
certainly
and
rapidly
from
his
peculiar
training
that
it
should
be
lost
or
impaired
was
a
most
serious
evil
that
it
would
not
have
been
endangered
we
are
sure
had
it
not
been
that
the
brigade
no
longer
consisted
of
the
brave
fellows
who
had
clung
to
him
through
the
campaigns
of
the
last
two
years
the
new
recruits
were
in
all
probability
to
blame
for
the
mischance
and
something
perhaps
is
due
to
the
unhappy
quarrel
between
mayham
and
horry
the
former
was
terribly
mortified
by
the
affair
mortified
that
marion
should
have
hurried
to
the
scene
of
action
without
apprising
him
and
vexed
that
his
own
regiment
should
have
behaved
so
badly
he
complains
that
others
should
expend
the
strength
of
the
regiment
without
giving
him
the
satisfaction
of
being
present
captain
john
caraway
smith
the
officer
who
led
the
column
thus
disastrously
aside
resigned
the
day
after
the
affair
his
conduct
had
been
habitually
brave
but
a
short
time
before
as
already
shown
he
had
behaved
with
the
most
determined
and
audacious
gallantry
at
the
head
of
the
same
troop
that
their
training
was
defective
is
beyond
question
but
no
imputation
rested
upon
their
courage
or
his
own
nevertheless
we
have
napoleon
authority
for
the
opinion
that
every
man
has
his
de
peur
no
man
is
equally
firm
on
all
occasions
there
are
moods
of
weakness
and
irresolution
in
every
mind
which
is
not
exactly
a
machine
which
impair
its
energies
and
make
its
course
erratic
and
uncertain
the
truth
was
known
in
earlier
ages
the
old
poets
ascribed
it
to
supernatural
influence
envious
deities
interposed
between
valor
and
its
victim
paralysing
the
soul
of
the
one
and
strengthening
that
of
the
other
thus
we
find
even
hector
upon
occasion
the
slave
of
panic
and
paris
on
the
other
hand
almost
emulating
the
spirit
of
his
brother
the
conduct
of
captain
smith
in
this
affair
has
been
excused
by
mayham
he
ascribes
it
to
an
error
of
marion
himself
he
says
that
marion
who
was
an
infantry
officer
gave
the
order
to
off
from
the
house
to
the
right
instead
of
ordering
charge
this
induced
his
officers
to
believe
that
they
were
to
retreat
and
not
to
fight
this
may
be
true
but
it
is
scarcely
probable
retreat
from
the
house
except
into
the
river
seems
to
have
been
cut
off
the
only
other
avenue
was
the
lane
at
the
end
of
this
was
the
enemy
drawn
out
in
order
of
battle
upon
these
the
advance
was
ordered
we
have
seen
that
marion
himself
exulted
in
the
conviction
that
the
enemy
was
in
his
power
his
exultation
could
not
have
been
entirely
concealed
from
his
officers
it
must
have
declared
itself
in
some
way
the
halt
and
hesitation
of
the
british
were
perceptible
to
all
they
were
in
superior
numbers
and
when
they
reached
the
head
of
the
lane
the
horses
of
the
american
cavalry
were
unbitted
and
feeding
a
sudden
and
resolute
charge
according
to
mayham
on
the
part
of
the
british
would
have
resulted
in
the
entire
defeat
of
the
regiment
that
they
did
not
order
this
charge
betrayed
their
apprehensions
and
should
have
encouraged
in
similar
degree
the
americans
did
encourage
them
and
hence
the
resolve
of
marion
to
advance
upon
them
that
it
should
be
supposed
he
would
hurry
forward
in
the
very
teeth
of
the
enemy
only
to
dash
aside
in
confusion
from
the
struggle
is
scarcely
reasonable
but
mayham
was
offended
with
marion
the
latter
had
decided
against
him
in
the
controversy
with
horry
and
the
subsequent
movement
against
the
british
without
stopping
to
require
his
presence
was
another
mortifying
circumstance
which
he
was
not
likely
to
forget
biased
by
his
feelings
he
was
not
willing
to
believe
that
the
seeming
slight
was
in
reality
due
to
the
emergency
of
the
case
which
would
not
allow
a
moment
hesitation
in
marion
movement
at
such
a
juncture
as
soon
as
the
presence
of
marion
was
known
the
fugitives
gathered
around
him
but
for
his
absence
they
had
never
been
dispersed
regiment
was
very
much
crippled
mayham
in
equally
bad
condition
of
and
the
brigade
a
few
hundred
were
soon
brought
together
and
with
his
deranged
and
dispirited
band
our
partisan
retired
beyond
the
santee
to
repair
and
recruit
his
strength
and
revive
the
confidence
of
his
men
in
their
leaders
and
themselves
in
the
meanwhile
the
country
which
he
had
so
recently
covered
and
protected
was
harried
by
the
british
they
improved
the
interval
of
his
absence
by
successful
incursions
the
cattle
had
been
already
put
beyond
their
power
on
the
other
side
the
santee
but
they
stripped
the
plantations
within
their
reach
as
well
of
slaves
as
of
provisions
greene
could
do
nothing
to
prevent
them
his
own
army
was
in
a
state
of
convulsion
and
commotion
suffering
from
distress
and
discontent
and
threatened
with
dissolution
recent
occurrences
had
awakened
his
fears
for
his
own
security
one
result
of
marion
recent
disaster
was
to
put
an
end
to
the
dispute
between
horry
and
mayham
their
respective
regiments
were
so
reduced
after
the
affair
at
wambaw
that
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
amalgamate
them
having
resolved
upon
this
measure
gov
mathews
who
had
succeeded
rutledge
applied
to
marion
to
know
who
of
the
two
was
the
best
cavalry
officer
an
opinion
which
marion
yielded
with
great
reluctance
his
personal
preferences
went
with
horry
but
he
could
not
hesitate
in
declaring
for
mayham
horry
with
the
ambition
of
a
spirited
soldier
eagerly
desired
a
command
of
cavalry
was
a
good
infantry
officer
and
had
all
the
requirements
of
skill
and
bravery
but
he
was
no
horseman
and
it
is
said
that
in
several
of
his
charges
he
was
indebted
to
some
one
or
other
of
his
men
for
his
own
safety
being
commonly
unhorsed
his
gallantry
and
patriotism
were
equally
unquestionable
they
had
been
displayed
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
the
preference
shown
mayham
caused
horry
resignation
from
the
service
but
to
console
him
for
the
mortification
marion
made
him
commandant
of
georgetown
a
post
which
united
the
responsibilities
and
duties
of
a
military
and
civil
service
with
the
adjournment
of
the
assembly
at
jacksonborough
the
army
of
greene
moved
down
from
skirving
plantation
to
bacon
bridge
at
the
head
of
ashley
river
here
within
twenty
miles
of
the
enemy
a
dangerous
conspiracy
ripened
almost
to
maturity
among
the
pennsylvania
troops
composed
in
part
of
the
very
mutineers
who
had
triumphed
over
government
in
the
insurrection
in
jersey
and
who
as
lafayette
observed
had
been
well
paid
and
well
clothed
in
consequence
of
it
this
we
believe
was
the
only
body
of
troops
furnished
to
the
southern
army
during
the
revolution
from
any
of
the
states
north
of
maryland
and
delaware
we
make
this
remark
with
the
view
to
the
correction
of
a
very
general
error
arising
from
the
vague
manner
in
which
it
is
customary
for
our
historians
to
speak
of
the
sources
of
the
personnel
of
the
southern
army
the
armies
led
by
gates
and
greene
to
the
defence
of
carolina
were
truly
from
states
north
of
her
but
they
were
not
northern
states
two
fine
bodies
of
troops
came
from
maryland
and
delaware
but
the
rest
were
from
virginia
and
north
carolina
with
the
exception
of
the
pennsylvania
line
of
which
we
have
now
to
speak
these
as
we
have
seen
had
been
refractory
in
jersey
and
instead
of
being
punished
were
paid
for
their
sedition
it
was
natural
that
they
should
endeavor
to
renew
an
experiment
which
had
already
proved
so
profitable
the
mutineers
were
directed
by
one
sergeant
gornell
their
number
is
unknown
they
were
solely
of
the
pennsylvania
line
and
might
have
been
successful
but
for
an
attempt
which
they
made
upon
the
fidelity
of
the
marylanders
their
purpose
was
to
deliver
greene
to
the
enemy
and
otherwise
facilitate
the
objects
of
the
latter
who
were
to
make
a
concerted
movement
in
force
upon
the
american
army
at
a
prescribed
moment
the
integrity
of
the
marylanders
whom
gornell
approached
was
not
to
be
shaken
and
to
their
fidelity
and
the
quick
ears
of
one
of
the
the
army
was
indebted
for
its
safety
the
circumstances
were
all
in
favor
of
the
success
of
the
conspirators
there
was
a
general
discontent
in
the
army
the
troops
were
badly
fed
and
clothed
were
unpaid
doubtful
of
pay
and
suffering
present
distresses
they
were
inactive
many
of
them
were
new
recruits
greene
was
no
longer
surrounded
by
the
tried
and
true
men
and
officers
who
had
borne
the
brunt
of
the
contest
the
term
of
service
of
the
former
had
in
great
part
expired
some
of
his
best
officers
were
on
furlough
and
he
had
offended
others
sumter
had
left
the
army
in
disgust
pickens

marion

recruiting

gone

shorn

eggleston
had
gone
with
him
to
virginia
and
the
brave
fellows
armstrong
and
carrington
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
time
was
well
chosen
for
mutiny
and
as
the
hour
drew
near
for
the
consummation
of
the
purpose
of
the
conspirators
the
british
army
was
set
in
motion
from
below
not
so
secretly
however
but
that
their
movements
were
made
known
to
the
americans
symptoms
of
mutiny
became
apparent
in
the
camp
and
it
was
necessary
to
proceed
with
vigor
doubtful
of
a
large
number
of
those
around
him
greene
summoned
marion
with
all
his
force
from
the
santee
while
his
own
army
was
kept
in
order
of
battle
the
arrest
of
gornell
with
that
of
four
others
all
sergeants
of
the
pennsylvania
line
took
place
the
night
before
the
conspiracy
was
to
take
effect
gornell
was
tried
and
executed
the
others
were
sent
under
guard
into
the
interior
this
proceeding
was
the
signal
for
the
flight
of
at
least
a
dozen
more
who
having
been
committed
broke
away
on
the
night
of
gornell
seizure
and
found
protection
with
the
enemy
who
advanced
in
force
to
receive
them
this
prompt
proceeding
suppressed
the
mutiny
the
development
of
the
conspiracy
the
state
of
preparedness
in
the
camp
of
greene
and
the
movement
of
marion
had
the
effect
of
discouraging
the
farther
advance
of
the
british
army
and
marion
while
yet
in
motion
for
the
camp
of
greene
from
which
he
was
but
eight
miles
distant
was
summoned
in
haste
to
the
protection
of
georgetown
against
which
the
enemy
was
reported
to
have
sailed
from
charleston
a
forced
march
of
four
days
brought
him
to
white
bridge
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
alarm
was
unfounded
the
enemy
had
not
shown
himself
and
was
not
nigh
in
this
march
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
miles
marion
men
had
but
a
single
ration
of
rice
their
sole
food
with
this
exception
was
lean
beef
the
march
took
place
in
april
when
there
is
no
forage
for
cattle
and
when
such
as
survive
the
winter
are
compelled
to
wander
far
in
the
swamps
and
thickets
in
search
of
the
scanty
herbage
which
sustains
them
the
march
of
our
partisan
in
these
two
expeditions
was
conducted
solely
on
foot
the
country
south
of
the
santee
had
been
so
completely
foraged
by
the
british
during
his
vacation
of
it
that
he
was
compelled
to
dismount
his
infantry
in
his
movements
until
the
spring
herbage
should
enable
him
to
feed
his
horses
his
force
was
reduced
to
two
hundred
militia
and
one
hundred
and
twenty
horse
it
was
the
wish
of
general
greene
that
he
should
take
post
as
near
the
enemy
as
possible
in
order
both
to
shorten
his
limits
beyond
cooper
river
and
to
enable
laurens
who
now
commanded
the
legion
of
lee
to
pass
the
ashley
and
close
upon
the
british
between
the
latter
river
and
goose
creek
but
with
his
infantry
dismounted
he
dared
not
venture
so
completely
within
the
reach
of
an
enemy
so
superior
and
with
the
double
purpose
of
securing
a
retreat
if
necessary
and
of
forming
a
junction
with
any
party
when
desirable
either
at
huger
bridge
over
the

his

at

they
thus
procured
the

of
the
movements
and
checked

in

quarter
the
effect
of

presence
with
his
brigade
was
soon
felt
as
well
by
his
people
as
by
the
british
by
the

was

important

and

a

his
way

of
marion
to
the
scotch
and
loyal
settlements
on

borders

these
were
to
be
stirred
up
to
insurrection
and
marion
was
to
be
diverted
from
a
quarter
in
which
his
presence
was
particularly
annoying
the
messenger
succeeded
in
his
object
but
was
less
fortunate
in
his
return
he
had
done
the
mischief
required
at
his
hands
fomented
the
insurrection
and
set
the
loyalists
in
motion
the
proofs
were
conclusive
against
him
and
he

little

a

were
obtained
from
among
those
who
had

received

the
service
had
been
of
a
kind
to
baffle
all
the
temptations
and
arguments
of
the
recruiting
officers
in
the
emergency
of
the
case
it
became
indispensable
to
look
to
the
militia
under
marion
pickens
and
henderson
and
these
leaders
were
accordingly
required
to
repair
to
headquarters
the
withdrawal
of
the
former
with
his
troops
from
the
region
of
country
which
they
had
so
lately
covered
was
the
signal
for
that
rising
of
the
loyalists
upon
the
pedee
to
instigate
which
the
unfortunate
emissary
of
general
leslie
had
been
dispatched
from
charleston
the
absence
of
marion
was
considered
auspicious
to
the
new
movement
he
had
scarcely
reached
dorchester
when
his
ancient
enemy
major
gainey
appeared
in
arms
at
the
head
of
a
considerable
body
of
troops
both
cavalry
and
infantry
a
small
command
under
baxter
which
had
been
left
by
marion
to
observe
their
movements
was
too
feeble
to
make
head
against
them
and
it
became
necessary
for
marion
himself
to
retrace
his
steps
and
arrest
the
progress
of
the
insurrection
placing
himself
at
the
head
of
mayham
cavalry
he
promptly
advanced
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
so
rapid
were
his
movements
so
vigilant
his
watch
so
well
devised
his
plans
that
he
reached
the
pedee
country
long
before
his
approach
was
suspected
his
presence
on
the
present
occasion
was
a
surprise
it
had
long
been
a
terror
so
much
so
that
but
for
his
remoteness
at
the
camp
of
greene
they
had
in
all
probability
never
ventured
to
resume
their
arms
three
separate
bodies
of
men
by
a
judicious
arrangement
of
our
partisan
were
prepared
to
enter
their
country
at
the
same
moment
these
were
so
placed
that
though
operating
separately
they
might
yet
be
made
to
cooperate
if
desired
the
effect
was
such
as
to
paralyse
the
incipient
resolution
of
the
loyalists
they
showed
no
disposition
for
fight
and
feeling
their
temper
conscious
of
his
difficulties
and
now
no
longer
hopeful
of
help
from
the
british
gainey
dispatched
a
flag
to
marion
with
proposals
to
treat
for
a
pacification
he
was
not
unwilling
to
renew
the
treaty
which
just
one
year
before
he
had
entered
into
with
horry
who
then
acted
as
the
lieutenant
of
our
partisan
this
treaty
influenced
by
british
emissaries
the
tories
had
very
imperfectly
kept
in
small
squads
they
had
been
perpetually
rising
and
committing
trespasses
upon
their
neighbors
whenever
the
withdrawal
of
marion
men
afforded
them
opportunity
they
had
now
everything
to
fear
from
his
anger
but
they
also
knew
his
willingness
to
forgive
relying
upon
this
and
making
a
merit
of
necessity
the
communication
of
gainey
expressed
the
warmest
solicitude
for
peace
to
this
marion
was
prepared
to
listen
commissioners
were
appointed
on
both
sides
they
met
but
unhappily
they
recognized
in
each
other
well
known
personal
opponents
they
had
often
met
in
strife
and
could
not
forbear
alluding
to
their
encounters
the
conversation
grew
warm
the
parties
excited
and
instead
of
coming
to
terms
the
commissioners
almost
came
to
blows
they
separated
with
increased
resentment
a
fierce
skirmish
followed
and
the
attempt
to
adjust
their
differences
was
renewed
between
the
respective
commanders
marion
was
anxious
to
effect
a
pacification
his
services
were
required
below
on
the
santee
and
cooper
to
check
the
incursions
of
the
british
and
he
consented
to
meet
and
confer
with
gainey
in
person
this
determination
was
censured
by
some
of
his
officers
they
denounced
gainey
as
a
leader
of
banditti
and
certainly
his
conduct
on
many
occasions
deserved
the
reproach
they
reproached
marion
for
committing
his
dignity
in
treating
with
such
a
person
but
this
suggestion
did
not
affect
him
he
was
governed
by
views
and
principles
very
far
superior
to
those
which
influence
the
ordinary
soldier
his
pride
did
not
suffer
from
such
censures
his
reply
was
equally
prompt
and
conclusive
he
told
them
that
he
aimed
at
no
higher
dignity
than
that
of
essentially
serving
his
country
the
result
was
satisfactory
to
our
partisan
making
a
merit
of
necessity
gainey
yielded
without
requiring
any
farther
resort
to
blows
at
the
bowling
green
between
the
great
and
little
pedee
more
than
five
hundred
men
laid
down
their
arms
submitting
to
conditions
which
were
rather
strict
than
severe
marion
and
gainey
met
at
birch
mill
on
the
june
when
a
treaty
was
drawn
up
having
for
its
basis
the
articles
of
the
preceding
arrangement
with
horry
by
this
treaty
gainey
and
his
men
were
to
lay
down
their
arms
and
not
to
resume
them
unless
ordered
to
do
so
by
the
authorities
of
the
state
they
bound
themselves
to
deliver
up
all
negroes
horses
cattle
and
other
property
of
which
they
had
dispossessed
the
people
of
this
or
any
other
state
to
demean
themselves
as
peaceable
citizens
and
submit
to
the
laws
of
the
state
to
deliver
up
all
contumacious
and
rebellious
persons
within
their
district
to
deliver
up
all
deserters
from
the
regular
service
to
sign
a
declaration
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
and
to
south
carolina
in
particular
and
to
abjure
the
british
crown
and
to
surrender
all
british
property
compliance
with
these
conditions
was
to
ensure
them
full
pardon
for
their
treasons
to
the
state
and
the
enjoyment
of
their
property
as
citizens
within
it
while
individuals
not
choosing
to
comply
were
to
be
permitted
with
their
wives
and
children
a
safe
progress
to
the
british
lines
from
the
benefits
of
this
treaty
some
few
atrocious
offenders
were
excepted
major
gainey
removed
with
those
who
preferred
to
adhere
to
the
fortunes
of
the
british
he
did
not
side
with
their
determination
but
he
deemed
it
a
duty
to
see
that
those
who
had
followed
his
arms
should
be
put
in
safety
beyond
the
reach
of
their
enemies
an
honorable
resolve
certainly
before
his
departure
he
waited
upon
marion
and
said
honor
sir
requires
that
i
should
yield
my
commission
to
balfour
from
whom
i
received
it
but
this
done
i
shall
immediately
return
to
the
country
and
seek
your
protection
this
was
frankly
promised
him
and
with
every
confidence
in
the
assurance
of
marion
as
soon
as
he
had
concluded
his
affairs
in
charleston
he
promptly
returned
and
enrolled
himself
in
the
american
ranks
one
of
the
loyalists
specially
exempted
from
the
privileges
of
the
treaty
with
gainey
was
a
notorious
marauder
by
the
name
of
fanning
he
was
a
sanguinary
ruffian
with
considerable
talents
but
brutal
reckless
and
most
inveterate
in
his
hostility
to
the
american
cause
shortly
after
the
treaty
with
gainey
this
person
appeared
in
the
truce
ground
at
the
head
of
a
small
party
it
was
feared
that
he
would
stir
up
the
revolt
anew
he
came
for
that
purpose
marion
was
at
once
upon
the
alert
his
force
divided
into
three
bodies
occupied
various
parts
of
the
lately
disaffected
districts
and
overawed
the
spirit
of
revolt
if
it
yet
existed
finding
the
cause
hopeless
in
that
quarter
fanning
sent
a
flag
to
marion
with
a
request
that
he
would
grant
a
to
his
wife
and
some
property
to
the
british
garrison
in
charleston
against
any
such
concession
the
officers
of
marion
expostulated
they
were
unwilling
that
so
cruel
a
ruffian
should
receive
any
indulgence
but
marion
looked
more
deeply
into
the
matter
and
yielded
a
prompt
compliance
with
the
request
let
but
his
wife
and
property
reach
the
british
lines
and
fanning
will
follow
force
them
to
remain
and
we
only
keep
a
serpent
in
our
bosom
such
was
his
reasoning
and
the
truth
of
it
was
very
soon
apparent
finding
the
hope
of
insurrection
fruitless
fanning
fled
the
country
and
was
as
soon
in
charleston
as
his
wife
the
disaffected
district
was
now
covered
by
his
troops
busied
in
securing
all
persons
who
declining
to
retire
to
the
british
still
withheld
their
submission
from
the
american
authorities
in
the
execution
of
this
duty
some
licentiousness
followed
such
irregularities
as
are
apt
to
occur
where
soldiers
traverse
a
subdued
territory
intimations
of
these
irregularities
reached
the
ears
of
the
partisan
no
individual
was
charged
with
offence
and
no
particulars
were
given
but
marion
took
occasion
to
declare
his
indignation
in
the
presence
of
officers
and
men
i
have
heard
insinuations
said
he
which
if
true
would
disgrace
my
command
no
accusation
has
been
made
but
i
wish
you
clearly
to
know
that
let
officer
or
soldier
be
proved
guilty
of
crime
and
he
shall
hang
on
the
next
tree
his
firmness
and
sincerity
were
known
and
he
heard
of
no
more
license
while
engaged
in
the
irksome
duty
of
arresting
the
recusant
he
was
equally
busy
in
granting
written
protections
to
those
who
subscribed
frankly
to
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
the
judicious
disposition
and
immediate
presence
of
his
force
the
terror
inspired
by
his
successes
the
knowledge
which
they
had
of
his
mercy
and
their
evident
abandonment
by
the
british
had
the
effect
of
bringing
crowds
to
his
camp
trebling
the
number
of
his
own
troops
seeking
the
proffered
securities
such
was
the
consumption
of
paper
on
this
occasion
or
rather
such
the
poverty
at
headquarters
that
old
letters
were
torn
up
the
backs
of
which
were
put
in
requisition
for
this
object
while
at
birch
mills
on
the
pedee
among
others
who
sought
the
protection
of
marion
was
one
capt
butler
who
had
made
himself
particularly
odious
by
his
crimes
and
ferocity
he
had
been
conspicuous
as
the
oppressor
of
the
whig
inhabitants
of
the
pedee
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
detestation
in
which
he
was
held
and
it
was
with
some
misgivings
that
he
sought
the
required
protection
his
appearance
in
the
american
camp
was
the
signal
for
a
commotion
there
were
among
the
men
of
marion
some
who
were
connected
with
persons
who
had
suffered
by
the
atrocities
of
butler
they
determined
to
avenge
their
friends
they
resolved
that
no
protection
should
save
him
and
an
intemperate
message
to
that
effect
was
sent
to
marion
marion
instantly
took
butler
to
his
own
tent
and
firmly
answered
those
by
whom
the
message
was
brought
relying
on
the
pardon
offered
the
man
whom
you
would
destroy
has
submitted
both
law
and
honor
sanction
my
resolution
to
protect
him
with
my
life
a
still
more
intemperate
message
reached
him
declaring
that
butler
should
be
dragged
to
death
from
his
tent
that
to
defend
such
a
wretch
was
an
insult
to
humanity
to
this
marion
made
no
reply
but
calling
around
him
the
members
of
his
family
and
some
of
his
most
trusty
followers
he
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
should
expect
their
cooperation
at
all
hazards
in
protecting
the
culprit
from
violence
prepare
to
give
me
your
assistance
for
though
i
consider
the
villainy
of
butler
unparalleled
yet
acting
under
orders
as
i
am
i
am
bound
to
defend
him
i
will
do
so
or
perish
the
mutiny
threatened
to
be
formidable
and
that
night
marion
succeeded
with
a
strong
guard
in
conveying
the
prisoner
to
a
place
of
safety
the
treaty
with
gainey
put
an
end
to
the
domestic
feuds
upon
the
pedee
and
anxious
to
regain
the
local
confidence
which
they
had
forfeited
numbers
of
the
loyalists
of
this
quarter
following
the
example
of
their
leader
entered
the
ranks
of
the
americans
and
though
too
late
to
be
of
effectual
service
in
the
war
yet
furnished
sufficient
proofs
of
their
fidelity
no
farther
necessity
appearing
for
the
longer
stay
of
marion
on
the
pedee
he
prepared
to
return
to
his
former
range
along
the
rivers
cooper
and
santee
his
absence
from
this
region
afforded
an
opportunity
for
the
enemy
to
renew
their
depredations
from
charleston
marion
had
left
colonel
ashby
in
command
of
his
infantry
when
at
the
head
of
horse
he
hurried
to
encounter
gainey
and
quell
his
insurrection
ashby
pressed
by
a
superior
british
force
had
been
compelled
to
yield
before
it
and
this
intelligence
left
our
partisan
no
moment
of
respite
after
quelling
the
commotions
on
the
pedee
before
he
was
required
to
return
and
cover
the
country
which
had
so
long
been
indebted
to
his
vigilance
for
protection
in
leaving
the
pedee
with
still
some
doubts
of
the
newly
converted
loyalists
of
that
quarter
he
left
baxter
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
trusty
men
to
maintain
the
ascendency
which
he
had
just
acquired
this
object
was
of
the
last
importance
not
only
with
reference
to
the
doubtful
of
the
country
but
the
valuable
cattle
and
provisions
which
might
have
been
carried
off
to
the
enemy
suspicious
of
the
fidelity
of
the
loyalists
there
was
every
reason
to
fear
that
it
might
be
too
strongly
tested
the
british
were
known
to
be
preparing
a
fleet
of
small
vessels
for
some
enterprises
directed
northwardly
and
no
object
of
importance
seemed
more
obvious
than
that
of
renewing
the
disturbances
on
the
pedee
and
possessing
themselves
of
the
immense
plunder
which
that
region
of
country
might
still
afford
all
precautions
taken
our
partisan
hurried
his
return
but
had
he
not
been
joined
by
a
newly
raised
corps
under
major
conyers
he
must
have
marched
alone
so
rapid
had
been
his
movements
so
unremitting
his
duties
that
the
cavalry
of
mayham
which
he
led
were
completely
broken
down
he
was
compelled
to
leave
them
behind
him
to
recruit
at
ferry
on
the
santee
he
halted
to
collect
his
militia
and
await
the
arrival
of
mayham
corps
here
he
consolidated
the
commands
of
mayham
and
conyers
into
one
regiment
and
about
the
middle
of
july
was
enabled
once
more
to
cross
the
santee
with
a
force
of
three
hundred
dismounted
infantry
and
a
respectable
body
of
horse
with
these
he
took
post
on
the
wassamasaw
in
a
position
which
while
it
was
secure
enabled
him
to
cooperate
with
the
detachments
of
the
main
army
in
covering
the
country
here
his
vigilance
was
again
conspicuous
his
parties
were
constantly
busy
his
own
movements
to
and
fro
wherever
an
enemy
could
approach
or
was
suspected
were
continual
from
the
cooper
to
the
santee
his
objects
were
threefold
to
check
the
irruptions
of
the
enemy
to
cut
off
their
supplies
and
to
provide
for
his
own
people
his
scouting
parties
penetrated
in
every
hostile
direction
sometimes
as
low
as
island
and
clement
ferry
points
almost
within
the
ken
of
the
british
garrison
but
the
enemy
was
no
longer
enterprising
they
were
not
often
met
their
cavalry
was
few
and
inferior
and
their
exigencies
may
be
inferred
from
their
uniforming
and
converting
some
of
their
captured
negroes
into
troopers
one
corps
of
these
black
dragoons
consisting
of
men
was
cut
to
pieces
by
one
of
marion
scouting
parties
of
twelve
commanded
by
capt
capers
the
british
tired
of
the
war
were
preparing
to
evacuate
the
country
preparatory
to
this
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
lay
in
sufficient
store
of
provisions
general
leslie
had
been
preparing
for
this
necessity
and
late
in
july
a
numerous
fleet
of
small
vessels
conveying
eight
hundred
men
and
convoyed
by
galleys
and
armed
brigs
left
charleston
to
proceed
as
it
was
conjectured
against
georgetown
this
compelled
marion
to
hasten
in
that
direction
here
he
made
every
arrangement
for
moving
the
public
stores
to
a
place
of
safety
black
mingo
was
preferred
as
the
depot
for
the
honorable
reason
as
given
in
marion
own
words
that
it
was
a
settlement
of
good
citizens
and
of
my
earliest
and
most
faithful
followers
but
the
enterprise
of
the
enemy
was
less
hazardous
the
collection
of
rice
was
their
object
this
was
to
be
found
in
the
greatest
quantity
on
the
santee
from
the
banks
of
which
river
they
carried
off
about
six
hundred
barrels
marion
force
was
thrown
over
the
sampit
so
as
to
intercept
their
march
to
georgetown
but
he
could
not
impede
their
progress
up
the
south
santee
protected
as
they
were
under
the
guns
of
their
galleys
with
the
departure
of
the
enemy
from
the
river
the
completion
of
his
arrangements
for
the
removal
of
the
stores
at
georgetown
and
the
defence
of
that
place
marion
again
recrossed
the
santee
and
hurried
to
watboo
on
the
cooper
this
river
leading
to
charleston
to
which
the
fleet
of
the
enemy
had
returned
was
naturally
thought
to
be
the
next
which
they
would
attempt
to
penetrate
he
had
left
a
small
body
of
infantry
at
this
place
but
this
was
deemed
inadequate
to
the
required
duties
but
they
were
sufficient
at
least
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
british
ignorant
of
marion
return
believing
him
to
be
still
at
georgetown
whither
it
was
known
he
had
taken
all
his
cavalry
a
detachment
of
dragoons
more
than
one
hundred
strong
was
sent
from
charleston
under
major
frasier
against
the
post
at
watboo
the
rapidity
of
marion
movements
brought
him
back
in
season
for
its
safety
it
happened
unfortunately
that
when
he
heard
of
the
approach
of
this
detachment
his
cavalry
were
absent
patrolling
down
the
river
maintaining
their
watch
for
the
british
fleet
which
was
the
chief
subject
of
apprehension
this
fleet
meanwhile
had
gone
southwardly
pursuing
the
object
of
its
former
quest
up
the
waters
of
the
combahee
with
the
approach
of
frasier
marion
dispatched
his
messengers
in
search
of
his
cavalry
and
to
call
in
his
pickets
some
of
the
latter
had
joined
him
before
the
enemy
appeared
frasier
exhibited
considerable
conduct
in
making
his
approaches
he
had
taken
an
unfrequented
route
and
had
succeeded
in
capturing
some
of
the
of
our
partisan
he
advanced
upon
him
in
the
fullest
confidence
of
effecting
a
surprise
not
of
marion
but
of
the
smaller
force
under
ashby
which
he
still
believed
to
be
the
only
force
opposed
to
him
he
was
soon
undeceived
and
found
his
enemy
rather
stronger
than
he
expected
and
drawn
up
in
readiness
for
his
reception
it
was
about
the
of
august
marion
lay
at
the
plantation
of
sir
john
colleton
on
the
south
side
of
watboo
creek
and
a
little
above
the
bridge
the
situation
pleased
him
and
it
was
one
of
his
frequent
places
of
encampment
when
he
happened
to
be
operating
in
the
vicinity
the
owner
was
a
loyalist
and
had
left
the
country
the
mansion
and
his
extensive
range
of
negro
houses
afforded
ample
shelter
for
such
a
force
as
that
which
marion
commanded
with
the
gradual
advance
of
frasier
marion
seems
to
have
been
acquainted
but
in
the
absence
of
his
cavalry
his
only
mode
of
obtaining
intelligence
was
through
his
officers
these
alone
of
all
the
party
in
camp
were
provided
with
horses
of
these
he
ordered
out
a
party
under
capt
gavin
witherspoon
to
reconnoitre
while
they
were
absent
marion
put
his
infantry
in
order
of
battle
the
main
body
occupied
an
avenue
of
venerable
cedars
which
neglected
during
the
war
in
their
untrimmed
state
stood
overgrown
with
branches
their
long
boughs
trailing
almost
to
the
ground
his
left
by
which
the
enemy
was
compelled
to
advance
were
placed
under
cover
of
some
of
the
thus
prepared
he
waited
the
approach
of
the
british
though
not
without
sundry
misgivings
it
must
be
confessed
that
at
this
juncture
he
had
not
the
most
perfect
confidence
in
the
force
under
his
command
they
consisted
in
great
proportion
of
those
who
in
that
day
were
known
as
whigs
men
who
had
deserted
the
enemy
and
been
cleansed
of
their
previous
treasons
by
the
proclamation
of
governor
rutledge
which
not
long
before
had
promised
immunity
to
all
who
came
in
promptly
with
their
adhesion
and
joined
the
american
ranks
there
were
also
present
some
of
those
who
under
gainey
had
recently
received
the
protection
of
marion
on
the
truce
ground
of
pedee
major
gainey
himself
was
among
them
and
with
forty
of
his
people
was
placed
conspicuously
in
the
column
in
preparation
for
the
british
approach
well
might
marion
feel
some
uneasiness
at
his
situation
particularly
in
the
absence
of
the
cavalry
on
which
he
could
rely
but
our
partisan
had
the
art
of
securing
the
fidelity
of
those
around
him
in
quite
as
great
a
degree
as
he
possessed
that
other
great
military
art
of
extracting
good
service
out
of
the
most
doubtful
materials
he
concealed
his
apprehensions
while
he
endeavored
to
dissipate
those
of
his
men
meanwhile
witherspoon
with
the
reconnoitring
party
advanced
but
a
little
distance
in
the
woods
when
they
were
met
by
the
enemy
cavalry
and
instantly
charged
a
long
chase
followed
which
soon
brought
the
pursuers
into
view
of
the
partisan
his
men
were
half
concealed
behind
the
thick
boughs
of
the
cedars
beneath
which
they
were
drawn
up
the
interest
of
the
chase
as
they
drew
more
near
was
increased
by
a
little
incident
which
was
greatly
calculated
to
encourage
the
militia
when
in
full
view
the
horse
of
witherspoon
failed
him
or
his
rider
purposely
fell
behind
to
bring
up
the
rear
of
his
little
escort
at
this
sight
a
british
dragoon
darted
forward
to
cut
him
down
witherspoon
coolly
suffered
him
to
advance
until
he
was
almost
within
striking
distance
with
sword
uplifted
the
assailant
had
already
risen
in
his
stirrups
to
smite
when
quick
as
lightning
witherspoon
who
had
watched
him
narrowly
poured
the
contents
of
his
carbine
into
his
breast
this
was
followed
by
a
shout
from
the
americans
and
with
furious
yells
the
british
dashed
forward
upon
marion
left
the
reconnoitring
party
melted
before
them
and
the
infantry
delivered
their
fire
with
fatal
effect
a
dozen
saddles
were
instantly
emptied
capt
gillies
of
the
british
who
led
the
charge
being
one
of
the
first
victims
the
enemy
soon
rallied
and
attempted
first
his
right
and
then
his
left
flank
but
the
evolutions
of
marion
were
quite
as
ready
and
by
changing
his
front
promptly
and
availing
himself
of
the
cover
afforded
by
the
houses
and
the
fences
he
showed
the
hazard
of
attempting
a
second
charge
to
be
too
great
for
such
a
force
as
that
of
frasier
for
an
hour
after
the
british
manoeuvred
around
them
but
without
discovering
any
opportunity
of
retrieving
or
revenging
their
disaster
a
single
fire
terminated
this
affair
and
seldom
has
a
single
fire
where
so
small
a
front
has
been
engaged
done
such
considerable
execution
one
officer
and
eight
men
were
instantly
killed
three
officers
and
eight
men
wounded
five
horses
fell
dead
upon
the
field
a
few
were
taken
and
many
wounded
the
discharge
took
place
at
thirty
paces
and
marion
men
usually
fired
with
heavy
his
whigs
stood
the
test
bravely
showing
a
steadiness
and
courage
whilst
opposed
to
their
old
allies
which
soon
set
the
heart
of
our
partisan
at
ease
they
had
very
good
reasons
for
steadiness
and
valor
they
fought
with
halters
about
their
necks
not
a
man
of
them
if
taken
would
have
escaped
the
cord
and
tree
marion
did
not
lose
a
man
but
he
suffered
a
very
serious
loss
of
another
sort
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
of
the
fight
the
driver
of
his
ammunition
wagon
took
fright
and
made
off
with
his
charge
in
a
direction
which
betrayed
its
flight
to
the
enemy
who
immediately
sent
a
small
detachment
by
which
it
was
taken
marion
had
no
cavalry
to
recover
it
but
five
of
his
men
armed
with
the
of
the
british
whom
they
had
just
slain
and
mounted
on
their
captured
horses
volunteered
to
recover
it
they
actually
succeeded
in
rescuing
it
from
the
detachment
by
which
it
was
taken
but
could
retain
it
only
till
the
fugitives
could
reach
their
main
body
and
return
with
a
force
to
which
our
volunteers
could
oppose
no
resistance
they
were
compelled
to
abandon
the
prize
which
had
fortune
seconded
their
endeavors
was
certainly
due
to
their
merits
this
little
affair
is
a
sample
of
that
generous
service
which
it
was
the
happy
faculty
of
our
partisan
to
extract
from
his
followers
it
is
to
tradition
that
we
owe
the
vague
memory
of
numerous
like
advantages
of
which
history
preserves
no
records
under
his
guidance
his
men
seldom
suffered
panic
they
fancied
themselves
invincible
when
he
led
in
the
present
instance
he
declared
that
not
a
man
faltered
that
he
even
had
to
restrain
their
eagerness
and
prevent
them
rushing
out
into
the
open
field
to
meet
the
charge
of
the
cavalry
his
own
coolness
never
deserted
him
he
never
lost
sight
of
the
whole
field
in
the
vehement
action
of
a
part
his
keenness
of
vision
his
vigilance
of
watch
his
promptness
in
opposing
his
best
resources
to
the
press
of
danger
of
covering
his
weak
points
and
converting
into
means
and
modes
of
defence
and
extrication
all
that
was
available
in
his
situation
were
remarkable
endowments
which
soon
fixed
the
regards
of
his
followers
and
upon
which
they
unhesitatingly
relied
in
the
absence
of
his
cavalry
a
defeat
would
have
been
a
rout
his
infantry
would
have
been
cut
to
pieces
and
his
cavalry
subsequently
exposed
to
similar
disaster
had
the
latter
been
present
the
safety
of
the
british
must
have
depended
solely
on
the
fleetness
of
their
steeds
with
this
affair
ended
the
actual
conflicts
of
our
partisan

men
were
not

disbanded
he
himself
did
not
yet
retire
from
the
field
which
he
had
so
often
traversed
in
triumph
but
the
occasion
for
bloodshed
was
over
the
great
struggle
for
ascendancy
between
the
british
crown
and
her
colonies
was
understood
to
be

end

still
continued
there
was

still

were
confined
to
these
narrow
limits
here
watched
on
all
sides
by
the
impatient
americans
they
made
their
preparations
for
a
reluctant
departure
the
sole
remaining
contest
between
the
opposing
armies
lay
in
the
desire
of
the
one
to
bear
with
them
as
much
of
the
spoils
of
war
as
possible
and
of
the
other
to
prevent
them
the
greater
motives
for
the
war
on
both
sides
were
at
an
end
the
mother
country
had
declared
her
willingness
to
forego
the
exercise
of
her
ancient
authority
and
the
colonies
were
admitted
to
the
freedom
which
they
sought
in
this
state
of
things
neither
army
attempted
enterprises
the
result
of
which
could
not
affect
the
objects
of
either
nation
thus
was
spared
the
unnecessary
shedding
of
blood
the
forces
under
greene
continued
gradually
to
contract
their
limits
while
those
of
general
leslie
remained
comparatively
quiescent
the
british
officer
was
governed
by
a
proper
wisdom
as
the
evacuation
of
charleston
was
determined
on
there
was
little
use
in
keeping
up
the
appearances
of
a
struggle
which
had
virtually
ceased
to
exist
he
suggested
accordingly
to
greene
that
an
intercourse
should
be
established
between
town
and
country
by
which
the
troops
in
the
former
might
procure
their
necessary
supplies
in
barter
with
the
people
to
provision
his
fleet
and
army
was
his
object
for
this
he
proposed
a
cessation
of
hostilities
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
this
pacific
proposition
was
not
entertained
some
valuable
lives
might
have
been
saved
to
the
country
we
may
instance
that
of
laurens
general
greene
was
not
adverse
to
the
proposition
but
the
civil
authorities
objected
their
reasons
for
opposing
this
humane
suggestion
are
scarcely
satisfactory
they
believed
that
leslie
only
aimed
to
accumulate
provisions
for
the
support
of
the
british
forces
in
the
west
indies
and
thus
enable
them
to
prosecute
the
war
more
vigorously
against
our
french
allies
this
was
an
objection
rather
urged
than
felt
there
was
probably
some
feeling
some
impatience
of
temper
at
the
bottom
which
prompted
them
to
dispute
at
the
point
of
the
sword
rather
than
yield
to
any
suggestions
of
an
enemy
at
whose
hands
they
had
suffered
such
protracted
injuries
a
little
more
coolness
and
reflection
might
have
shown
them
that
by
refusing
the
application
of
leslie
they
only
rendered
it
necessary
that
the
british
should
pay
in
blood
for
those
supplies
for
which
they
were
not
unwilling
to
pay
in
money
and
blood
usually
calls
for
blood
the
combat
is
never
wholly
on
one
side
it
was
virtually
saying
we
can
spare
a
few
more
citizens
the
concession
might
have
been
made
to
the
wishes
of
the
british
commander
not
only
without
any
detriment
to
the
service
but
with
absolute
benefit
to
the
people
and
the
army
the
provisions
which
the
enemy
required
would
have
found
a
good
market
in
charleston
and
the
clothing
in
lack
of
which
the
army
was
suffering
severely
might
have
been
procured
for
them
at
the
same
place
on
the
most
reasonable
terms
besides
the
rejection
of
the
overture
was
not
necessarily
a
prevention
of
the
purpose
of
the
british
the
american
army
was
quite
too
feeble
either
to
expel
them
from
the
country
or
to
arrest
their
foraging
parties
the
only
effect
of
the
rejection
of
the
humane
and
pacific
proposition
of
the
british
commander
was
to
compel
the
preparation
of
that
fleet
of
small
craft
which
under
the
guns
of
his
galleys
was
now
penetrating
the
rivers
and
rifling
the
grain
from
the
wealthy
plantations
we
have
seen
marion
opposing
himself
to
this
fleet
at
georgetown
and
have
witnessed
their
success
upon
the
south
santee
the
prompt
return
of
our
partisan
to
the
head
waters
of
cooper
river
in
all
probability
preserved
that
neighborhood
from
the
foragers
with
the
tidings
of
their
progress
up
the
combahee
the
american
light
brigade
under
general
gist
was
ordered
to
oppose
them
it
was
here
that
one
of
those
events
took
place
which
furnished
a
conclusive
commentary
upon
the
resolution
by
which
the
cessation
of
hostilities
was
rejected
and
the
british
denied
the
privilege
of
procuring
supplies
in
a
pacific
manner
hearing
of
the
movement
of
gist
laurens
who
was
attached
to
his
brigade
and
was
always
eager
for
occasions
of
distinction
rose
from
a
sick
bed
to
resume
the
command
of
his
division
he
overtook
the
brigade
on
the
north
bank
of
the
combahee
river
near
the
ferry
twelve
miles
below
the
extreme
end
of
chehaw
neck
protrudes
into
the
bed
of
the
river
which
between
these
points
is
bounded
by
extensive
swamps
and
rice
fields
at
this
point
a
redoubt
had
been
thrown
up
by
general
gist
the
enemy
was
already
above
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
laurens
solicited
the
command
of
this
post
for
the
purpose
of
annoying
them
in
their
retreat
meanwhile
the
american
cavalry
under
major
call
had
been
ordered
round
by
salkehatchie
bridge
to
join
with
the
militia
collected
in
that
quarter
for
the
purpose
of
striking
at
the
enemy
with
a
howitzer
some
matrosses
and
fifty
infantry
laurens
moved
down
the
river
and
on
the
evening
of
the
reached
the
place
of
stock
sufficiently
near
to
chehaw
point
to
take
post
there
by
daylight
the
next
morning
but
the
british
were
there
before
him
baffled
by
the
light
brigade
of
gist
in
procuring
provisions
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
they
had
crossed
it
and
apprised
of
the
movements
of
laurens
placed
an
ambush
for
him
on
his
road
to
the
point
that
night
was
spent
by
laurens
among
the
ladies
of
the
place
where
he
lingered
it
is
recorded
that
the
company
did
not
separate
until
a
couple
of
hours
before
the
time
when
the
detachment
was
set
in
motion
the
prospect
of
his
encounter
was
the
topic
of
conversation
and
with
the
cheery
elastic
spirit
of
youth
he
gaily
offered
the
ladies
a
conspicuous
place
from
which
they
might
enjoy
a
sight
of
the
action
without
incurring
its
dangers
before
sunrise
his
voice
was
hushed
for
ever
unsuspicious
of
an
enemy
he
rode
at
the
head
of
his
command
the
british
were
posted
in
a
place
thickly
covered
with
fennel
and
high
grass
with
the
advance
guard
when
they
were
discovered
he
promptly
ordered
a
charge
gallantly
leading
which
he
fell
at
the
first
fire
laurens
was
one
of
those
brave
and
ardent
spirits
generous
and
immaculate
which
in
times
of
sordid
calculation
and
drilled
soldiership
recall
to
our
minds
the
better
days
of
chivalry
he
was
the
bayard
of
the
southern
youth
in
the
war
of
the
revolution
uniting
all
the
qualities
of
the
famous
chevalier
peur
et
sans
reproche
that
he
should
have
fallen
unnecessarily
at
the
close
of
the
war
when
nothing
was
to
be
gained
and
nothing
to
be
saved
by
valor
and
in
an
obscure
encounter
on
a
field
of
mere
predatory
warfare
doubles
the
mortification
of
such
a
close
to
a
noble
and
admirable
career
a
lesson
from
the
pure
and
correct
code
of
marion
military
morals
would
have
saved
this
precious
blood
and
preserved
this
gallant
youth
for
nobler
fortunes
the
following
anecdote
will
illustrate
the
admirable
character
of
his
mode
of
thinking
on
such
subjects
while
he
held
his
position
at
watboo
after
he
had
beaten
frasier
he
was
advised
that
a
british
party
which
had
been
dispatched
to
procure
water
at
lempriere
point
could
be
cut
off
with
little
difficulty
the
british
were
then
preparing
for
embarkation
a
parting
blow
was
recommended
as
calculated
to
hurry
their
movements
as
well
as
to
add
something
to
the
measure
of
patriot
revenge
for
the
wrongs
and
resentments
of
the
past
but
marion
resolutely
refused
to
sanction
the
enterprise
his
answer
proves
equally
the
excellence
of
his
judgment
and
the
benevolence
of
his
heart
my
brigade
said
he
is
composed
of
citizens
enough
of
whose
blood
has
been
shed
already
if
ordered
to
attack
the
enemy
i
shall
obey
but
with
my
consent
not
another
life
shall
be
lost
though
the
event
should
procure
me
the
highest
honors
of
the
soldier
knowing
as
we
do
that
the
enemy
are
on
the
eve
of
departure
so
far
from
offering
to
molest
i
would
rather
send
a
party
to
protect
them
this
noble
feeling
would
have
saved
the
lives
of
laurens
wilmot
moore
and
other
gallant
young
men
who
were
sacrificed
at
the
last
hour
when
all
provocations
to
strife
had
ceased
when
the
battle
was
already
won
when
the
great
object
of
the
war
had
been
attained
by
the
one
party
and
yielded
however
reluctantly
by
the
other
capt
wilmot
with
a
small
command
was
stationed
to
cover
john
island
and
to
watch
the
passage
by
stono
fond
of
enterprise
he
was
tempted
occasionally
to
cross
the
river
and
harass
the
enemy
on
james
island
in
one
of
these
adventures
undertaken
in
conjunction
with
the
celebrated
kosciusko
against
an
armed
party
of
the
enemy
he
fell
into
an
ambuscade
was
himself
slain
while
his
second
in
command
lieut
moore
severely
wounded
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
british
this
was
the
last
blood
shed
in
the
american
revolution
it
need
not
to
have
been
shed
the
denouement
of
the
protracted
drama
had
already
taken
place
the
conquest
of
the
indians
by
pickens
was
complete
the
tories
no
longer
appeared
in
bodies
though
for
some
time
after
individuals
of
the
scattered
bands
occasionally
continued
the
habits
of
outlawry
which
the
war
had
taught
them
and
dealt
in
deeds
of
midnight
robbery
and
crime
and
the
british
armies
were
simply
preparing
to
depart
on
the
of
december
while
the
american
columns
entered
the
city
from
the
neck
those
of
the
british
retired
to
their
ships
the
movements
of
which
as
their
white
sails
distended
to
the
breeze
presented
in
the
language
of
moultrie
a
grand
and
pleasing
sight
it
was
a
sight
however
which
the
militia
always
undervalued
always
misunderstood
and
misrepresented
were
not
permitted
to
behold
they
had
fought
the
battle
it
was
true
but
the
civil
authority
conceived
their
uses
to
be
over
and
they
were
excluded
as
dangerous
spectators
an
unworthy
and
most
ungrateful
decision
in
which
we
are
pleased
to
learn
from
a
letter
of
general
greene
he
had
no
participation
and
which
he
did
not
approve
the
forces
of
the
british
withdrawn
from
the
shores
of
carolina
the
country
exhausted
of
resources
and
filled
with
malcontents
and
mourners
was
left
to
recover
slowly
from
the
hurts
and
losses
of
foreign
and
intestine
strife
wounds
were
to
be
healed
which
required
the
assuasive
hand
of
time
which
were
destined
to
rankle
even
in
the
bosoms
of
another
generation
and
the
painful
memory
of
which
is
keenly
treasured
even
now
but
the
civil
authority
takes
the
place
of
the
military
and
with
the
disappearance
of
the
invader
the
warrior
lays
aside
his
sword
satisfied
if
he
may
still
retain
the
laurels
which
his
valor
has
won
our
partisan
yielding
himself
at
the
call
of
his
country
was
not
the
man
to
linger
unnecessarily
long
upon
the
stage
the
duties
which
had
called
him
into
the
field
were
faithfully
performed
how
faithfully
it
has
been
the
effort
of
this
humble
narrative
to
show
the
time
was
come
when
he
was
to
part
with
his
brigade
forever
when
he
was
to
take
leave
of
those
brave
fellows
whom
he
had
so
frequently
led
to
victory
never
to
dishonor
the
separation
was
touching
but
without
parade
on
this
occasion
his
deportment
was
as
modest
as
it
had
been
through
the
whole
period
of
their
connection
gathered
around
him
among
the
cedars
at
his
watboo
encampment
his
followers
were
assembled
to
receive
his
last
farewell
the
simplicity
which
had
marked
his
whole
career
distinguished
its
conclusion
his
address
was
brief
but
not
without
its
eloquence
such
eloquence
as
belongs
to
the
language
of
unaffected
and
unadulterated
truth
he
acknowledged
with
thanks
the
services
of
the
officers
and
men
dwelt
passingly
upon
particular
events
of
which
they
had
reason
to
be
proud
and
bade
them
a
friendly
and
affectionate
farewell
the
brief
review
which
he
made
of
their
campaigns
was
well
calculated
to
awaken
the
most
touching
recollections
he
had
been
their
father
and
protector
no
commander
had
ever
been
more
solicitous
of
the
safety
and
comfort
of
his
men
it
was
this
which
had
rendered
him
so
sure
of
their
fidelity
which
had
enabled
him
to
extract
from
them
such
admirable
service
his
simple
entreaty
stayed
their
quarrels
and
the
confidence
which
they
yielded
to
his
love
of
justice
made
them
always
willing
to
abide
the
decisions
of
his
judgment
officers
and
men
equally
yielded
to
the
authority
of
his
opinion
as
they
did
to
that
which
he
exercised
in
the
capacity
of
their
commander
no
duel
took
place
among
his
officers
during
the
whole
of
his
command
the
province
which
was
assigned
to
his
control
by
governor
rutledge
was
the
constant
theatre
of
war
he
was
required
to
cover
an
immense
extent
of
country
with
a
force
constantly
unequal
and
constantly
fluctuating
he
contrived
to
supply
its
deficiencies
by
the
resources
of
his
own
vigilance
and
skill
his
personal
bravery
was
frequently
shown
and
the
fact
that
he
himself
conducted
an
enterprise
was
enough
to
convince
his
men
that
they
were
certain
to
be
led
to
victory
in
due
degree
with
their
conviction
of
his
care
and
consideration
for
themselves
was
their
readiness
to
follow
where
he
commanded
he
had
no
lives
to
waste
and
the
game
he
played
was
that
which
enabled
him
to
secure
the
greatest
results
with
the
smallest
amount
of
hazard
yet
when
the
occasion
seemed
to
require
it
he
could
advance
and
strike
with
an
audacity
which
in
the
ordinary
relations
of
the
leader
with
the
soldier
might
well
be
thought
inexcusable
rashness
we
have
already
in
the
opening
of
this
biography
adverted
to
the
melancholy
baldness
of
the
memorials
upon
which
the
historian
is
compelled
to
rely
for
the
materials
of
his
narrative
the
reader
will
perceive
a
singular
discrepancy
between
the
actual
events
detailed
in
the
life
of
every
popular
hero
and
the
peculiar
fame
which
he
holds
in
the
minds
of
his
countrymen
thus
while
marion
is
everywhere
regarded
as
the
peculiar
representative
in
the
southern
states
of
the
genius
of
partisan
warfare
we
are
surprised
when
we
would
trace
in
the
pages
of
the
annalist
the
sources
of
this
fame
to
find
the
details
so
meagre
and
so
unsatisfactory
tradition
mumbles
over
his
broken
memories
which
we
vainly
strive
to
pluck
from
his
lips
and
bind
together
in
coherent
and
satisfactory
records
the
spirited
surprise
the
happy
ambush
the
daring
onslaught
the
fortunate
escape
these
as
they
involve
no
monstrous
slaughter
no
murderous
strife
of
masses
no
rending
of
walled
towns
and
sack
of
cities
the
ordinary
historian
disdains
the
military
reputation
of
marion
consists
in
the
frequent
performance
of
deeds
unexpectedly
with
inferior
means
by
which
the
enemy
was
annoyed
and
dispirited
and
the
hearts
and
courage
of
his
countrymen
warmed
into
corresponding
exertions
with
his
own
to
him
we
owe
that
the
fires
of
patriotism
were
never
extinguished
even
in
the
most
disastrous
hours
in
the
low
country
of
south
carolina
he
made
our
swamps
and
forests
sacred
as
well
because
of
the
refuge
which
they
gave
to
the
fugitive
patriot
as
for
the
frequent
sacrifices
which
they
enabled
him
to
make
on
the
altars
of
liberty
and
a
becoming
vengeance
we
are
in
possession
of
but
few
of
the
numerous
enterprises
in
which
he
was
engaged
imperfect
memories
of
the
aged
give
us
glimpses
of
deeds
for
the
particulars
of
which
we
turn
in
vain
to
the
dusty
pages
of
the
chronicler
but
we
need
not
generalize
farther
upon
the
traits
of
his
military
character
we
have
endeavored
to
make
these
speak
for
themselves
page
by
page
in
the
narration
of
the
events
so
far
as
we
know
them
by
which
his
reputation
was
acquired
it
is
enough
that
his
fame
has
entered
largely
into
that
of
his
country
forming
a
valuable
portion
of
its
sectional
stock
of
character
his
memory
is
in
the
very
hearts
of
our
people
of
the
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
by
contemporaries
more
might
be
said
but
these
pages
bear
ample
testimony
of
the
consideration
which
he
commanded
from
friend
and
foe
the
testimonials
of
moultrie
greene
lee
and
others
are
conclusive
of
that
rare
worth
and
excellence
that
combination
of
military
and
civil
virtues
which
biography
can
not
easily
be
found
to
excel

had
always
given
since
manhood
to
the
life
of
the
farmer
that
he
returned
to
its
simple
but
attractive
avocations
but
the
world
with
him
was
as
it
were
to
be
begun
anew
no
easy
matter
to
one
whose
habits
had
been
necessarily
rendered
irregular
by
the
capricious
and
desultory
influences
of
a
military
career
still
more
difficult
in
the
case
of
one
who
has
entered
upon
the
last
period
of
life
the
close
of
the
revolution
found
him
destitute
of
means
almost
in
poverty
and
more
than
fifty
years
old
his
health
was
good
however
his
frame
elastic
his
capacity
for
endurance
seemingly
as
great
as
ever
but
his
little
fortune
had
suffered
irretrievably
his
interests
had
shared
the
fate
of
most
other
southern
patriots
in
the
long
and
cruel
struggle
through
which
the
country
had
gone
his
plantation
in
john
berkeley
lay
within
a
mile
of
one
of
the
ordinary
routes
of
the
british
army
and
his
career
was
not
calculated
to
move
them
to
forbearance
in
the
case
of
one
whose
perpetual
activity
and
skill
so
constantly
baffled
their
designs
his
estate
was
ravaged
and
subjected
to
constant
waste
and
depredation
of
his
negroes
were
taken
away
and
the
rest
only
saved
to
him
by
their
fidelity
the
refuge
in
swamp
and
forest
was
as
natural
to
the
faithful
negro
on
the
approach
of
the
british
uniforms
as
to
the
fugitive
patriot
ten
workers
returned
to
him
when
he
was
prepared
to
resume
his
farm
but
he
was
destitute
of
everything
beside
the
implements
of
culture
plantation
utensils
household
furniture
stock
cattle
and
horses
clothes
and
provisions
for
his
people
were
all
wanting
and
all
to
be
purchased
and
he
penniless
he
received
no
compensation
for
his
losses
no
reward
for
his
sacrifices
and
services
the
hope
of
half
pay
was
held
out
to
him
by
his
more
sanguine
friends
but
this
promise
was
never
realized
but
with
that
cheerful
spirit
which
hopes
all
things
from
time
and
a
meek
compliance
with
what
it
brings
marion
proceeded
to
work
out
his
deliverance
by
manly
industry
and
a
devotion
to
his
interests
as
true
as
that
which
he
had
yielded
to
the
interests
of
his
country
he
had
become
fond
of
rural
life
and
the
temporary
estrangement
of
war
seemed
only
to
increase
his
desire
for
that
repose
in
action
which
the
agricultural
life
in
the
south
so
certainly
secures
but
he
was
not
permitted
to
retire
from
public
service
the
value
of
his
services
was
too
well
known
and
there
was
too
much
yet
to
be
done
towards
the
repose
and
security
of
the
country
to
suffer
them
to
be
dispensed
with
he
was
again
returned
to
the
senate
of
the
state
by
the
people
of
john
in
this
situation
he
still
maintained
those
noble
and
disinterested
characteristics
which
had
made
him
equally
beloved
and
venerated
two
anecdotes
are
preserved
of
him
in
his
official
character
which
deserve
mention
both
of
these
grew
out
of
the
events
of
the
war
the
importance
of
the
confiscation
act
passed
at
the
session
of
january
at
jacksonborough
arose
chiefly
from
the
necessity
of
providing
for
the
emergencies
of
the
state
and
military
during
the
continuance
of
the
war
under
existing
circumstances
the
measure
was
sustained
by
our
partisan
but
the
case
was
altered
when
the
british
ministry
abandoned
their
pretensions
to
the
country
and
when
it
was
left
by
their
armies
it
was
then
that
numerous
offenders
those
who
had
been
least
conspicuous
for
their
tory
predilections
applied
for
the
indulgence
and
forbearance
of
the
state
petitions
were
poured
into
the
legislature
sustained
by
such
pleas
and
friends
as
the
circumstances
of
the
suppliants
could
procure
excusing
their
conduct
asserting
their
repentance
and
imploring
the
restoration
of
their
possessions
course
in
regard
to
these
suppliants
may
be
inferred
from
his
previous
character
there
was
nothing
vindictive
in
his
nature
he
was
superior
to
the
baser
cravings
of
a
dogged
vengeance
and
his
vote
and
voice
declared
his
magnanimity
it
so
happened
that
the
first
of
these
petitions
upon
which
he
was
called
to
act
came
from
one
of
that
class
of
timid
persons
who
with
no
predilections
for
virtue
no
sympathy
for
principles
or
country
simply
shape
their
course
with
regard
to
safety
he
was
a
man
of
wealth
and
the
effect
of
wealth
in
perilous
times
is
but
too
frequently
to
render
selfishness
equally
cowardly
and
dishonest
the
amount
of
his
offence
consisted
in
trimming
while
the
strife
was
doubtful
between
whig
and
tory
and
siding
with
the
latter
when
the
british
gained
the
ascendency
he
did
not
take
up
arms
took
no
active
part
in
public
affairs
and
was
content
to
shelter
his
person
and
possessions
under
a
cautious
insignificance
about
eighteen
months
before
marion
had
met
the
petitioner
at
a
gathering
of
the
people
the
latter
approached
and
offered
our
partisan
his
hand
but
the
juncture
was
one
in
which
it
behooveth
patriotism
to
speak
out
at
all
hazards
the
struggle
was
for
life
and
death
on
the
part
equally
of
whig
and
tory
marion
knew
the
character
of
the
person
and
disdained
it
to
the
surprise
of
all
who
knew
how
scrupulous
of
insult
he
was
how
indulgent
and
forbearing
he
turned
away
from
the
trimmer
and
the
sycophant
without
recognition
this
treatment
was
greatly
censured
at
the
time
and
when
marion
rose
in
the
senate
to
speak
on
the
subject
of
the
petition
of
the
man
whom
he
had
so
openly
scorned
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
he
would
again
give
utterance
to
feelings
of
the
sort
which
moved
him
then
the
miserable
offender
who
was
himself
present
grew
pale
trembled
and
gave
up
his
cause
as
lost
what
was
his
surprise
and
delight
to
hear
the
venerable
patriot
advocate
his
application
he
was
successful
in
obtaining
for
the
suppliant
the
mercy
which
he
implored
the
opponents
of
the
petitioner
some
of
whom
were
of
that
class
of
patriots
who
hunger
for
the
division
of
the
spoils
were
aghast
and
having
counted
on
marion
support
now
loudly
proclaimed
his
inconsistency
but
to
these
his
answer
was
equally
prompt
and
satisfactory
his
reasons
were
true
to
his
principles
he
had
been
governed
in
his
previous
views
by
the
necessity
of
the
case
with
the
disappearance
of
that
necessity
he
recognized
other
laws
and
influences
then
said
he
it
was
war
it
is
peace
now
god
has
given
us
the
victory
let
us
show
our
gratitude
to
heaven
which
we
shall
not
do
by
cruelty
to
man
the
expediency
of
humanity
was
always
the
uppermost
sentiment
with
marion
a
nobler
expression
of
it
never
fell
from
the
lips
of
mortal
the
next
anecdote
of
the
legislative
career
of
marion
is
one
which
directly
related
to
himself
at
an
early
period
in
the
action
of
the
assembly
after
the
war
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
introduce
a
bill
by
which
to
exempt
from
legal
investigation
the
conduct
of
the
militia
while
the
war
had
lasted
it
was
thought
justly
enough
that
from
the
nature
of
the
services
in
which
they
were
engaged
and
the
necessities
which
coerced
them
they
might
need
in
numerous
instances
to
be
sheltered
from
legal
persecution
they
had
been
compelled
to
war
with
a
heavy
hand
to
seize
frequently
upon
private
property
and
subject
the
possessions
of
the
citizen
to
the
exigencies
of
the
community
the
necessities
of
the
service
being
recognized
the
legislature
were
ready
to
justify
them
and
the
act
which
was
prepared
for
the
purpose
included
amongst
others
thus
specially
exempted
the
name
of
marion
but
scarcely
had
it
been
announced
from
the
paper
when
the
venerable
man
arose
and
with
flushed
cheeks
and
emphatic
brevity
demanded
that
his
name
should
be
expunged
from
the
catalogue
he
declared
himself
friendly
to
the
bill
he
believed
it
to
be
equally
just
and
necessary
but
for
his
own
part
as
he
was
not
conscious
of
any
wrong
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
he
was
not
anxious
for
any
immunity
if
said
he
i
have
given
any
occasion
for
complaint
i
am
ready
to
answer
in
property
and
person
if
i
have
wronged
any
man
i
am
willing
to
make
him
restitution
if
in
a
single
instance
in
the
course
of
my
command
i
have
done
that
which
i
can
not
fully
justify
justice
requires
that
i
should
suffer
for
it
so
proud
was
his
integrity
so
pure
and
transparent
was
his
happy
consciousness
of
a
mind
fixed
only
on
good
and
regulated
by
the
sternest
rules
of
virtue
and
the
nicest
instincts
of
gentleness
and
love
the
bill
passed
into
a
law
but
the
name
of
marion
omitted
at
his
requisition
is
nowhere
present
as
showing
that
he
needed
other
security
than
that
which
is
afforded
to
the
meanest
citizen
under
the
keenest
scrutiny
of
justice
marion
did
not
confine
his
objections
to
the
continued
operation
of
the
confiscation
act
to
the
single
instance
which
we
have
given
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
his
labors
to
remedy
its
hardships
and
restrain
its
severities
were
uniform
and
unremitting
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
favored
the
original
bill
he
considered
it
a
war
measure
and
necessary
to
the
prosecution
of
the
war
the
propriety
of
the
distinction
which
he
made
just
after
the
war
was
over
obvious
enough
to
us
now
was
not
so
evident
at
a
season
when
the
victors
were
looking
after
the
division
of
the
spoils
the
subject
became
one
of
considerable
excitement
and
we
may
say
in
this
place
that
after
time
had
mollified
the
popular
feeling
in
some
degree
the
state
admitted
the
greater
number
of
the
offenders
to
mercy
and
restored
their
estates
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
humane
sentiments
which
marion
taught
were
not
universal
and
met
with
most
violent
opposition
his
feelings
on
the
subject
were
not
only
declared
with
frankness
but
with
warmth
and
energy
dining
at
the
table
of
governor
matthews
while
the
strife
was
highest
he
was
called
upon
by
his
excellency
for
a
toast
lifting
his
glass
with
a
smile
he
promptly
gave
the
following
gentlemen
damnation
to
the
confiscation
act
though
in
the
language
of
moultrie
born
a
soldier
and
yielding
so
many
of
his
youthful
and
maturer
years
to
the
habits
of
the
camp
and
field
there
was
nothing
of
a
harsh
or
imperious
nature
in
his
temper
or
his
manner
the
deportment
of
the
mere
soldier
seems
to
have
been
his
aversion
he
preferred
the
modest
and
forbearing
carriage
which
is
supposed
to
belong
more
distinctly
to
civil
than
to
military
life
no
novelty
of
situation
no
provocation
of
circumstance
nothing
in
the
shape
of
annoyance
or
disaster
was
suffered
so
to
ruffle
his
mood
as
to
make
him
heedless
or
indifferent
to
the
claims
or
sensibilities
of
others
he
never
conceived
that
any
of
his
virtues
gave
him
a
right
to
trespass
upon
the
proprieties
of
social
or
public
life
an
anecdote
is
related
of
him
which
illustrates
the
veneration
which
he
entertained
for
the
regulations
of
society
and
law
it
appears
that
when
the
war
was
over
one
of
his
closest
intimates
and
nearest
friends
one
whom
he
had
trusted
long
and
who
had
shared
with
him
in
all
his
campaigns
stood
within
the
perils
of
the
law
for
some
offence
of
which
the
facts
have
not
been
preserved
presuming
upon
his
services
and
the
favor
in
which
he
was
held
by
the
public
he
refused
to
submit
to
the
ordinary
legal
process
and
bade
defiance
to
the
sheriff
while
maintaining
this
position
marion
sought
him
out
he
used
no
argument
to
convince
the
offender
of
his
error
for
that
he
felt
assured
the
other
sufficiently
knew
but
he
addressed
him
in
a
style
and
with
words
which
conveyed
much
more
than
any
ordinary
argument
deliver
yourself
said
he
into
the
hands
of
justice
submit
to
the
process
of
the
sheriff
and
my
heart
and
hand
are
yours
as
before
resist
refuse
and
we
are
separated
for
ever
it
need
not
be
said
that
under
such
an
exhortation
the
refractory
spirit
was
subdued
how
much
to
be
regretted
it
is
that
so
few
anecdotes
have
been
preserved
of
his
character
illustrating
a
life
which
according
to
all
testimony
was
consistent
throughout
in
a
just
appreciation
of
all
that
was
pure
virtuous
and
becoming
in
the
character
of
the
individual
man
early
in
the
year
the
following
resolutions
passed
in
the
senate
of
south
carolina
marion
who
was
a
member
not
being
present
at
the
time
senate
south
carolina
february
resolved
nem
that
the
thanks
of
this
house
be
given
to
brigadier
general
marion
in
his
place
as
a
member
of
this
house
for
his
eminent
and
conspicuous
services
to
his
country
resolved
nem
that
a
gold
medal
be
given
to
brigadier
general
marion
as
a
mark
of
public
approbation
for
his
great
glorious
and
meritorious
conduct
two
days
after
marion
being
in
his
place
in
the
senate
the
president
took
occasion
to
convey
to
him
the
sense
of
these
resolutions
in
a
neat
and
highly
laudatory
speech
he
said
among
other
things
when
i
consider
the
occasion
which
calls
me
to
address
you
i
am
filled
with
inexpressible
pleasure
but
when
i
reflect
on
the
difficulty
of
doing
justice
to
your
distinguished
merit
i
feel
my
own
inefficiency
what
sentiments
or
words
shall
i
make
use
of
equal
to
the
task
i
scarce
dare
trust
my
own
especially
after
what
has
been
said
by
several
honorable
persons
on
this
floor
respecting
your
great
your
glorious
and
meritorious
conduct
and
i
most
earnestly
wish
for
my
own
sake
for
yours
sir
and
for
the
honor
of
this
house
that
i
could
avail
myself
of
their
eloquence
your
conduct
merits
the
applause
of
your
countrymen
your
courage
your
vigilance
and
your
abilities
have
exceeded
their
most
sanguine
expectations
and
have
answered
all
their
hopes
whilst
the
virtue
of
gratitude
shall
form
a
part
of
our
national
character
your
important
services
to
this
country
can
never
be
forgotten
to
this
marion
replied
with
simple
brevity
president
the
approbation
which
this
house
have
given
of
my
conduct
in
the
execution
of
my
duty
gives
me
very
pleasing
and
heartfelt
satisfaction
the
honor
which
they
have
conferred
on
me
this
day
by
their
thanks
will
be
remembered
with
gratitude
i
shall
always
be
ready
to
exert
my
abilities
for
the
good
of
the
state
and
the
liberties
of
her
inhabitants
i
thank
you
sir
for
the
polite
manner
in
which
you
have
conveyed
to
me
the
thanks
of
the
senate
whether
the
medal
was
really
given
or
only
voted
is
a
fact
that
we
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
action
of
the
senate
went
no
farther
than
the
resolution
and
the
speech
it
probably
remains
a
reproach
against
the
republic
in
this
as
in
numerous
other
instances
that
knowing
what
gratitude
required
we
would
yet
forego
the
satisfaction
of
the
debt
cheaply
at
best
was
our
debt
to
marion
satisfied
with
a
gold
medal
or
the
vote
of
one
while
greene
received
ten
thousand
guineas
and
a
plantation
we
quarrel
not
with
the
appropriation
to
greene
but
did
marion
deserve
less
from
carolina
every
page
of
her
history
answers
no
by
the
legislative
session
of
fort
johnson
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
was
fitted
up
and
garrisoned
by
the
state
in
the
unstable
condition
of
things
so
immediately
after
the
war
some
such
fortress
might
well
be
deemed
essential
to
the
security
of
the
port
marion
was
appointed
commandant
of
the
fort
with
an
annual
salary
of
pounds
the
office
was
in
all
probability
made
for
him
his
necessities
were
known
and
its
salary
was
intended
to
compensate
him
for
his
losses
during
the
war
but
the
duties
of
the
office
were
nominal
even
its
possible
uses
soon
ceased
to
be
apparent
and
with
a
daily
increasing
sense
of
security
the
people
murmured
at
an
appropriation
which
they
considered
unnecessarily
burdensome
the
common
mind
could
not
well
perceive
that
the
salary
was
not
so
much
yielded
for
what
was
expected
of
the
office
as
for
what
had
already
been
performed
it
was
not
given
for
present
but
for
past
services
it
was
the
payment
of
a
debt
incurred
not
a
simple
appropriation
for
the
liquidation
of
one
growing
out
of
current
performances
legislative
reformers
waged
constant
war
against
it
and
it
was
finally
cut
down
to
five
hundred
dollars
a
smile
of
fortune
one
of
the
fairest
perhaps
that
had
ever
shone
on
our
hero
just
then
relieved
him
from
the
mortifying
necessity
of
holding
a
sinecure
which
his
fellow
citizens
pronounced
an
encumbrance
it
had
been
observed
by
his
friends
that
there
was
a
lady
of
good
family
and
considerable
wealth
who
appeared
to
take
a
more
than
ordinary
interest
in
hearing
of
his
exploits
modest
and
reserved
himself
marion
was
not
conscious
of
the
favorable
impression
which
he
had
made
upon
this
lady
it
was
left
for
others
to
discover
the
state
of
her
affections
they
remarked
the
delight
with
which
like
the
gentle
lady
wedded
to
the
moor
she
listened
to
the
tale
of
his
achievements
his
in
th
imminent
deadly
breach
of
being
taken
by
the
insolent
foe
and
they
augured
favorably
of
the
success
of
any
desire
which
he
might
express
to
make
her
the
sharer
in
his
future
fortunes
on
this
hint
he
spake
miss
mary
videau
like
himself
came
of
the
good
old
huguenot
stock
the
virtues
of
which
formed
our
theme
in
the
opening
chapter
of
this
narrative
he
proposed
to
her
and
was
accepted
neither
of
them
was
young
it
was
not
in
the
heyday
of
passion
that
they
loved
the
tie
that
bound
them
sprang
from
an
affection
growing
out
of
a
just
appreciation
of
their
mutual
merits
she
is
reported
to
have
somewhat
resembled
him
as
well
in
countenance
as
character
she
certainly
shared
warmly
in
his
interests
and
feelings
she
readily
conformed
to
his
habits
no
less
than
his
wishes
partook
of
his
amusements
shared
his
journeys
which
were
frequent
and
still
in
his
absence
could
listen
with
as
keen
a
zest
to
his
praises
as
before
their
marriage
during
the
summer
months
it
was
his
almost
yearly
custom
to
retire
to
the
mountains
of
the
interior
she
was
always
his
companion
on
such
occasions
he
was
guilty
of
a
piece
of
military
ostentation
of
which
nobody
could
have
accused
him
while
a
military
man
he
had
preserved
carefully
as
memorials
of
an
eventful
history
his
marquee
camp
bed
and
cooking
utensils
just
as
he
had
done
while
in
the
brigade
during
the
last
twelve
months
of
his
military
life
these
were
carefully
taken
with
him
and
with
his
faithful
servant
oscar
and
his
two
sumpter
mules
were
still
the
companions
of
his
wanderings
they
were
coupled
no
doubt
with
many
associations
as
interesting
to
his
heart
as
they
were
trying
to
his
experience
they
were
perhaps
doubly
precious
as
they
constituted
the
sum
total
of
all
that
he
had
gathered
besides
an
honorable
fame
from
his
various
campaignings
the
marriage
of
marion
like
that
of
washington
was
without
fruits
this
may
have
baffled
some
hopes
and
in
some
degree
qualified
his
happiness
but
did
not
impair
his
virtues
he
adopted
the
son
of
a
relative
to
whom
he
gave
his
own
name
in
the
hope
of
perpetuating
it
in
the
family
but
even
this
desire
has
been
defeated
since
the
heir
thus
chosen
though
blessed
with
numerous
children
was
never
so
fortunate
as
to
own
a
son
in
the
decline
of
life
in
the
modest
condition
of
the
farmer
marion
seems
to
have
lived
among
his
neighbors
very
much
as
the
ancient
patriarch
surrounded
by
his
flock
he
was
honored
and
beloved
by
all
his
dwelling
was
the
abode
of
content
and
cheerful
hospitality
its
doors
were
always
open
and
the
chronicler
records
that
it
had
many
chambers
here
the
stranger
found
a
ready
welcome
and
his
neighbors
a
friendly
counsellor
to
the
last
his
active
habits
were
scarcely
lessened
in
the
latter
years
of
life
his
agricultural
interests
were
managed
judiciously
and
his
property
underwent
annual
increase
nor
did
his
domestic
interests
and
declining
years
prevent
him
from
serving
the
public
still
he
still
held
a
commission
in
the
militia
and
continued
to
represent
the
parish
of
john
in
the
senate
of
the
state
in
may
we
find
him
sitting
as
a
member
of
the
convention
for
forming
the
state
constitution
but
from
this
period
he
withdrew
from
public
life
and
in
after
the
reorganization
of
the
state
militia
he
resigned
his
commission
in
that
service
to
which
he
had
done
so
much
honor
on
this
occasion
he
was
addressed
by
an
assembly
of
the
citizens
of
georgetown
through
a
special
committee
of
four
in
the
following
language
the
committee
consisted
of
william
james
robert
brownfield
thomas
mitchell
and
joseph
citizen
general
at
the
present
juncture
when
the
necessity
of
public
affairs
requires
the
military
of
this
state
to
be
organized
anew
to
repel
the
attacks
of
an
enemy
from
whatever
quarter
they
may
be
forced
upon
us
we
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
georgetown
finding
you
no
longer
at
our
head
have
agreed
to
convey
to
you
our
grateful
sentiments
for
your
former
numerous
services
in
the
decline
of
life
when
the
merits
of
the
veteran
are
too
often
forgotten
we
wish
to
remind
you
that
yours
are
still
fresh
in
the
remembrance
of
your
fellow
citizens
could
it
be
possible
for
men
who
have
served
and
fought
under
you
to
be
now
forgetful
of
that
general
by
whose
prudent
conduct
their
lives
have
been
saved
and
their
families
preserved
from
being
plundered
by
a
rapacious
enemy
we
mean
not
to
flatter
you
at
this
time
it
is
impossible
to
suspect
it
our
present
language
is
the
language
of
freemen
expressing
only
sentiments
of
gratitude
your
achievements
may
not
have
sufficiently
swelled
the
historic
page
they
were
performed
by
those
who
could
better
wield
the
sword
than
the
pen
by
men
whose
constant
dangers
precluded
them
from
the
leisure
and
whose
necessities
deprived
them
of
the
common
implements
of
writing
but
this
is
of
little
moment
they
remain
recorded
in
such
indelible
characters
upon
our
minds
that
neither
change
of
circumstances
nor
length
of
time
can
efface
them
taught
by
us
our
children
shall
hereafter
point
out
the
places
and
say
general
marion
posted
to
advantage
made
a
glorious
stand
in
defence
of
the
liberties
of
his
country
there
on
disadvantageous
ground
retreated
to
save
the
lives
of
his
fellow
citizens
what
could
be
more
glorious
for
the
general
commanding
freemen
than
thus
to
fight
and
thus
to
save
the
lives
of
his
fellow
soldiers
continue
general
in
peace
to
till
those
acres
which
you
once
wrested
from
the
hands
of
an
enemy
continue
to
enjoy
dignity
accompanied
with
ease
and
to
lengthen
out
your
days
blessed
with
the
consciousness
of
conduct
unaccused
of
rapine
or
oppression
and
of
actions
ever
directed
by
the
purest
patriotism
the
artless
language
of
this
address
was
grateful
to
the
venerable
patriot
in
its
truth
and
simplicity
lay
its
force
and
eloquence
it
had
truly
embodied
in
a
single
sentence
the
noble
points
of
his
career
and
character
he
lived
in
the
delightful
consciousness
of
a
pure
mind
free
from
accusation
and
no
higher
eulogy
could
be
conferred
upon
the
captain
of
citizen
soldiers
than
to
say
he
never
wantonly
exposed
their
lives
but
was
always
solicitous
of
their
safety
to
this
address
his
answer
was
verbal
he
no
longer
used
the
pen
the
feebleness
of
nature
was
making
itself
understood
that
he
felt
himself
failing
may
be
inferred
from
his
withdrawal
from
all
public
affairs
but
his
mind
was
cheerful
and
active
to
the
last
he
still
saw
his
friends
and
neighbors
and
welcomed
their
coming
could
still
mount
his
horse
and
cast
his
over
his
acres
the
progress
of
decline
in
his
case
was
not
of
that
humiliating
kind
by
which
the
faculties
of
the
intellect
are
clouded
and
the
muscles
of
the
body
made
feeble
and
incompetent
he
spoke
thoughtfully
of
the
great
concerns
of
life
of
death
and
of
the
future
declared
himself
a
christian
a
humble
believer
in
all
the
vital
truths
of
religion
as
of
the
future
he
entertained
no
doubt
so
of
the
awful
transition
through
the
valley
and
shadow
of
death
he
had
no
fear
death
may
be
to
others
said
he
a
leap
in
the
dark
but
i
rather
consider
it
a
where
old
age
may
throw
off
its
burdens
he
died
peaceful
and
assured
with
no
apparent
pain
and
without
regret
at
his
residence
in
john
parish
on
the
day
of
february
having
reached
the
mature
and
mellow
term
of
years
his
last
words
declared
his
superiority
to
all
fears
of
death
for
thank
god
said
he
i
can
lay
my
hand
on
my
heart
and
say
that
since
i
came
to
man
estate
i
have
never
intentionally
done
wrong
to
any
thus
died
francis
marion
one
of
the
noblest
models
of
the
citizen
soldier
that
the
world
has
ever
produced
brave
without
rashness
prudent
without
timidity
firm
without
arrogance
resolved
without
rudeness
good
without
cant
and
virtuous
without
presumption
his
mortal
remains
are
preserved
at
in
john
parish
the
marble
slab
which
covers
them
bears
the
following
inscription
sacred
to
the
memory
of
francis
marion
who
departed
this
life
on
the
of
in
the
year
of
his
age
deeply
regretted
by
all
his
fellow
citizens
history
will
record
his
worth
and
rising
generations
embalm
his
memory
as
one
of
the
most
distinguished
patriots
and
heroes
of
the
american
revolution
which
elevated
his
native
country
to
honor
and
independence
and
secured
to
her
the
blessings
of
liberty
and
peace
this
tribute
of
veneration
and
gratitude
is
erected
in
commemoration
of
the
noble
and
disinterested
virtues
of
the
citizen
and
the
gallant
exploits
of
the
soldier
who
lived
without
fear
and
died
without
reproach
this
inscription
was
the
tribute
of
an
individual
not
of
the
country
the
state
of
south
carolina
has
conferred
his
name
upon
one
of
its
district
divisions
but
a
proper
gratitude
not
to
speak
of
policy
would
seem
to
require
more
if
it
be
we
love
his
fame
and
virtues
it
were
well
methinks
to
link
them
with
his
name
i
the
public
eye
that
men
who
in
the
paths
of
gainful
trade
do
still
forget
the
venerable
and
good
may
have
such
noble
monitor
still
nigh
and
musing
at
his
monument
recall
those
precious
memories
of
the
deeds
of
one
whose
life
were
the
best
model
for
their
sons

number
of

which
might
be
considered
errors
and
might
not
have
been
retained
where
they
are
less
likely
to
interfere
with
reading
when
the
true
facts
were
known
either
from
context
or
outside
reading
a
few
other
errors
were
corrected
a

the

these
errors
are
not
merely
represented
here
for
their
scholastic
interest
but
also
to
give
the
reader
an
appreciation
of
the
types
of
errors
which
simms
was
frequently
subject
to
make
many
have
most
certainly
not
been
caught
if
i
had
not
lived
in
the
waxhaw
area
i
certainly
would
not
have
known
of
the
error
footnoted
in
the
text
which
replaced
with
two
very
different
regions
names
are
particularly
prone
to
error
not
only
by
simms
but
from
the
whole
revolutionary
era
in
the
south
many
of
the
people
were
only
if
literate
at
all
and
many
of
the
names
have
been
spelled
several
even
a
dozen
ways
sometimes
even
by
the
individual
named
for
all
this
the
errors
of
simms
are
generally
minor
and
will
not
prevent
the
reader
from
a
true
appreciation

b
song
of
marion
men
by
william
cullen
bryant
as
this
poem
is
quoted
in
part
by
simms
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
book
i
have
considered
it
appropriate
to
include
the
whole
here
our
band
is
few
but
true
and
tried
our
leader
frank
and
bold
the
british
soldier
trembles
when
marion
name
is
told
our
fortress
is
the
good
greenwood
our
tent
the
we
know
the
forest
round
us
as
seamen
know
the
sea
we
know
its
walls
of
thorny
vines
its
glades
of
reedy
grass
its
safe
and
silent
islands
within
the
dark
morass
woe
to
the
english
soldiery
that
little
dread
us
near
on
them
shall
light
at
midnight
a
strange
and
sudden
fear
when
waking
to
their
tents
on
fire
they
grasp
their
arms
in
vain
and
they
who
stand
to
face
us
are
beat
to
earth
again
and
they
who
fly
in
terror
deem
a
mighty
host
behind
and
hear
the
tramp
of
thousands
upon
the
hollow
wind
then
sweet
the
hour
that
brings
release
from
danger
and
from
toil
we
talk
the
battle
over
and
share
the
battle
spoil
the
woodland
rings
with
laugh
and
shout
as
if
a
hunt
were
up
and
woodland
flowers
are
gathered
to
crown
the
soldier
cup
with
merry
songs
we
mock
the
wind
that
in
the
grieves
and
slumber
long
and
sweetly
on
beds
of
oaken
leaves
well
knows
the
fair
and
friendly
moon
the
band
that
marion
leads
the
glitter
of
their
rifles
the
scampering
of
their
steeds
is
life
to
guide
the
fiery
barb
across
the
moonlight
plain
is
life
to
feel
the
that
lifts
his
tossing
mane
a
moment
in
the
british
camp
a
moment
and
away
back
to
the
pathless
forest
before
the
peep
of
day
grave
men
there
are
by
broad
santee
grave
men
with
hoary
hairs
their
hearts
are
all
with
marion
for
marion
are
their
prayers
and
lovely
ladies
greet
our
band
with
kindliest
welcoming
with
smiles
like
those
of
summer
and
tears
like
those
of
spring
for
them
we
wear
these
trusty
arms
and
lay
them
down
no
more
till
we
have
driven
the
briton
forever
from
our
shore
