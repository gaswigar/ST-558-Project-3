chapter
i
sounds
from
a
distant
just
a
noise
that
is
all
but
a
very
significant
noise
to
miss
nathalie
rogers
or
nattie
as
she
was
usually
abbreviated
a
noise
that
caused
her
to
lay
aside
her
book
and
jump
up
hastily
exclaiming
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
somebody
always
me
in
the
middle
of
every
entertaining
chapter
for
that
noise
that
little
clatter
like
and
yet
too
irregular
to
be
the
ticking
of
a
clock
expressed
to
nattie
these
four
mystic
letters
b
m
x
n
which
same
four
mystic
letters
interpreted
meant
that
the
name
or
to
use
the
technical
word
call
of
the
telegraph
office
over
which
she
was
present
sole
presiding
genius
was
b
m
and
that
b
m
was
wanted
by
another
office
on
the
wire
designated
as
x
a
little
country
office
some
fifty
miles
down
the
line
was
x
n
and
as
nattie
signaled
in
reply
to
the
call
her
readiness
to
receive
any
communications
therefrom
she
was
conscious
of
holding
in
some
slight
contempt
the
possible
abilities
of
the
human
portion
of
its
machinery
for
who
but
an
operator
very
green
in
the
profession
would
stay
consequently
she
was
quite
unprepared
for
the
velocity
with
which
the
telegraph
alphabet
of
sounds
in
dots
and
dashes
rattled
over
the
instrument
appropriately
termed
a
sounder
upon
which
messages
are
received
and
found
herself
wholly
unable
to
write
down
the
words
as
fast
as
they
came
dear
me
she
thought
rather
nervously
the
country
is
certainly
ahead
of
the
city
this
time
i
wonder
if
this
smart
operator
is
a
lady
or
gentleman
and
notwithstanding
all
her
efforts
she
was
compelled
to
break
that
is
open
her
key
thereby
breaking
the
circuit
and
interrupting
x
n
with
the
request
please
repeat
x
n
took
the
interruption
very
it
was
after
dinner
and
obeyed
without
expressing
any
impatience
but
alas
nattie
was
even
now
unable
to
keep
up
with
this
too
expert
individual
of
uncertain
sex
and
was
obliged
again
to
break
with
the
humiliating
petition
please
send
slower
oh
responded
x
for
a
small
one
oh
is
a
very
expressive
word
but
whether
this
particular
one
signified
impatience
or
as
nattie
sensitively
feared
contempt
for
her
abilities
she
could
not
tell
but
certain
it
was
that
x
n
sent
along
the
letters
now
in
such
a
slow
funereal
procession
that
she
was
driven
half
frantic
with
nervousness
in
the
attempt
to
piece
them
together
into
words
they
had
not
proceeded
far
however
before
a
small
thin
voice
fell
upon
the
ears
of
the
agitated
nattie
are
you
taking
a
message
now
it
asked
nattie
glanced
over
her
shoulder
and
saw
a
sharp
inquisitive
nose
a
green
veil
a
pair
of
and
a
strained
smile
sticking
through
her
little
window
nodding
a
hasty
answer
to
the
question
she
wrote
down
another
word
of
the
message
that
she
had
been
able
to
catch
notwithstanding
the
interruption
as
she
did
so
the
voice
again
queried
do
you
take
them
entirely
by
sound
with
a
determined
endeavor
not
to
break
nattie
replied
only
with
a
frown
but
fate
was
evidently
against
her
establishing
a
reputation
for
being
a
good
operator
with
x
here
please
attend
to
this
quick
exclaimed
a
new
voice
and
a
tall
gentleman
pounded
impatiently
on
the
shelf
outside
the
little
window
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
held
forth
a
message
with
despair
in
her
heart
once
more
nattie
interrupted
x
n
took
the
impatient
gentleman
message
studied
out
its
illegible
characters
and
changed
a
bill
the
owner
of
the
nose
looking
on
attentively
meanwhile
this
done
she
bade
the
really
x
n
to
proceed
or
in
telegraphic
terms
to
g
the
g
a
being
the
telegraphic
abbreviation
for
go
ahead
and
the
the
last
word
she
had
received
of
the
message
and
this
time
not
even
the
fact
of
its
being
after
dinner
restrained
x
n
feelings
and
x
n
made
the
sarcastic
inquiry
had
you
not
better
go
home
and
send
down
some
one
who
is
capable
of
receiving
this
message
now
it
would
seem
as
if
two
persons
sixty
or
seventy
miles
apart
might
severally
fly
into
a
rage
and
nurse
their
wrath
comfortably
without
particularly
annoying
each
other
at
the
moment
but
not
under
present
conditions
and
nattie
turned
red
and
bit
her
nails
excitedly
under
the
displeasure
of
the
distant
person
of
unknown
sex
at
x
but
no
instrument
had
yet
been
invented
by
which
she
could
see
the
expression
on
the
face
of
this
operator
at
x
n
as
she
retorted
and
her
fingers
formed
the
letters
very
sharply
do
you
think
it
will
help
the
matter
at
all
for
you
to
make
a
display
of
your
charming
disposition
g
the
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
return
the
compliment
implied
was
x
n
preface
to
the
continuation
of
the
message
and
now
indeed
nattie
might
have
recovered
some
of
her
fallen
glories
being
angry
enough
to
be
fiercely
determined
had
not
the
owner
of
the
nose
again
made
her
presence
manifest
by
the
sudden
question
do
you
have
a
different
sound
for
every
word
or
syllable
or
what
and
turning
quickly
around
to
scowl
this
persevering
questioner
into
silence
nattie
elbow
hit
and
knocked
over
the
inkstand
its
contents
pouring
over
her
hands
dress
the
desk
and
floor
and
proving
beyond
a
doubt
as
it
descended
the
truth
of
its
label
superior
black
ink
and
then
save
for
the
clatter
of
the
sounder
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
nattie
gazed
blankly
at
her
besmeared
hands
and
ruined
dress
at
the
sounder
and
at
the
owner
of
the
nose
who
returned
her
look
with
that
expression
of
serene
amusement
often
noticeable
in
those
who
contemplate
from
afar
the
mishaps
of
their
fellow
beings
then
with
the
courage
of
despair
she
for
the
fourth
time
broke
x
n
saying
with
inky
impression
on
the
instrument
excuse
me
but
you
will
have
to
wait
i
am
all
ink
and
i
am
being
having
thus
delivered
herself
she
turned
a
deliberately
deaf
ear
to
x
n
response
which
judging
from
the
way
the
movable
portion
of
the
sounder
danced
was
emphatic
a
little
new
milk
will
take
that
out
complacently
said
the
owner
of
the
nose
watching
nattie
efforts
to
remove
the
ink
from
her
dress
with
unfortunately
i
do
not
keep
a
cow
here
nattie
replied
tartly
not
quite
polite
in
nattie
this
but
do
not
the
circumstances
plead
strongly
in
her
excuse
for
remember
she
was
not
one
of
those
impossible
angelic
young
ladies
of
whom
we
read
but
one
of
the
ordinary
human
beings
we
meet
every
day
the
owner
of
the
nose
however
was
not
charitable
and
drew
herself
up
loftily
as
she
said
in
imperative
accents
you
did
not
answer
my
question
do
you
have
to
learn
the
sound
of
each
letter
so
as
to
distinguish
them
from
each
other
nattie
constrained
herself
to
reply
very
shortly
yes
can
you
take
a
message
and
talk
to
me
at
the
same
time
pursued
the
investigator
no
was
nattie
emphatic
answer
as
she
looked
ruefully
at
her
dress
but
your
instrument
there
is
going
it
now
ai
they
sending
you
a
message
went
on
the
relentless
owner
of
the
nose
at
this
nattie
turned
her
attention
a
moment
to
what
was
being
done
on
the
wire
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
for
x
n
had
given
place
to
another
office
and
she
replied
no
some
office
on
the
wire
is
sending
to
some
other
office
the
nose
elevated
itself
in
surprise
can
you
hear
everything
that
is
sent
from
every
other
office
yes
was
the
weary
reply
as
nattie
rubbed
her
dress
what
exclaimed
the
owner
of
the
nose
in
accents
of
incredulous
wonder
all
over
the
world
certainly
not
only
the
offices
on
this
wire
there
are
about
twenty
was
the
impatient
reply
ah
evidently
relieved
but
considering
supposing
you
do
not
catch
all
the
sounds
what
do
you
do
then
break
break
break
what
the
instruments
queried
the
owner
of
the
nose
perplexedly
and
looking
as
if
that
must
be
a
very
expensive
habit
break
the
circuit
the
connection
open
the
key
and
ask
the
sending
office
to
repeat
from
the
last
word
i
have
been
able
to
catch
then
seeing
unmistakable
evidence
of
more
questions
in
the
nose
nattie
threw
the
and
her
last
remnant
of
patience
into
the
waste
basket
and
added
but
you
must
excuse
me
i
am
too
busy
to
be
annoy
interrupted
longer
and
there
are
books
that
will
give
you
all
the
information
that
you
require
so
saying
nattie
turned
her
back
and
the
owner
of
the
nose
withdrew
it
its
tip
glistening
with
indignation
as
she
walked
away
as
it
vanished
nattie
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
sat
down
to
mourn
her
ruined
dress
whatever
may
have
been
her
previous
opinion
she
was
positive
now
that
this
was
the
prettiest
the
most
becoming
dress
she
had
ever
possessed
or
might
ever
possess
only
the
old
old
story
we
prize
most
what
is
gone
forever
and
all
that
dreadful
man
or
woman
fault
at
x
n
cried
nattie
savagely
unjustly
too
for
if
any
one
was
responsible
for
the
accident
it
was
the
owner
of
the
nose
but
not
long
did
nattie
dare
give
way
to
her
misery
that
fatal
message
was
not
yet
received
glancing
over
the
few
words
she
had
of
it
she
read
send
the
hearse
and
then
she
began
anxiously
calling
x
hearse
looked
too
serious
for
trifling
but
either
x
n
attention
was
now
occupied
in
some
other
direction
or
else
he
or
she
was
too
much
out
of
humor
to
reply
for
it
was
full
twenty
minutes
before
came
the
answering
x
at
which
nattie
said
as
fiercely
as
fingers
could
i
have
been
after
you
nearly
half
an
hour
have
you
came
coolly
back
from
x
well
you
not
alone
many
are
after
me
my
landlord
among
others
not
to
mention
a
washerwoman
or
two
then
followed
the
figure
which
means
when
shall
i
go
ahead
waxing
jocose
are
you
nattie
murmured
to
herself
as
she
replied
g
hearse
g
hearse
repeated
nattie
in
firm
clear
characters
to
her
surprise
and
displeasure
x
n
laughed
the
circumstance
being
conveyed
to
her
understanding
in
the
usual
way
by
the
two
letters
h
a
what
are
you
laughing
at
she
asked
at
your
grave
mistake
was
x
n
answer
accompanied
by
another
ha
to
convert
a
into
a
hearse
is
really
an
idea
that
merits
a
smile
as
the
consciousness
of
her
blunder
dawned
upon
her
nattie
would
gladly
have
sank
into
oblivion
but
as
that
was
impossible
she
took
a
fresh
blank
and
very
meekly
said
g
horse
with
another
laugh
x
n
complied
and
nattie
now
succeeded
in
receiving
the
message
without
further
mishap
what
did
you
sign
she
asked
as
she
thankfully
wrote
the
last
word
every
operator
is
obliged
to
sign
his
own
private
call
as
well
as
the
office
call
and
at
the
close
of
each
message
was
replied
to
nattie
question
b
m
she
then
said
and
added
perhaps
trying
to
drown
the
memory
of
her
ludicrous
error
in
politeness
i
hope
another
time
i
shall
not
cause
you
so
much
trouble
c
at
x
n
was
evidently
not
to
be
exceeded
in
little
speeches
of
this
kind
for
he
or
she
responded
immediately
on
the
contrary
it
was
i
who
gave
you
trouble
i
know
i
must
certainly
have
done
so
or
you
never
could
have
effected
such
a
transformation
as
you
did
imagine
the
feelings
of
the
sender
of
that
message
had
he
found
a
hearse
awaiting
his
arrival
instead
of
a
horse
biting
her
lip
with
secret
mortification
but
determined
to
make
the
best
of
the
matter
outwardly
nattie
replied
i
suppose
i
never
shall
hear
the
last
of
that
hearse
but
at
all
events
it
took
the
surliness
out
of
you
yes
when
people
come
to
a
hearse
they
are
not
apt
to
have
any
more
kinks
in
their
disposition
i
confess
though
c
went
on
frankly
i
was
unpardonably
cross
not
surly
that
is
out
of
my
line
but
cross
in
truth
i
was
all
out
of
sorts
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
will
never
do
so
again
certainly
nattie
replied
readily
i
am
sure
we
are
far
enough
apart
to
get
on
without
quarreling
if
as
they
say
distance
lends
enchantment
particularly
when
i
pride
myself
upon
my
sweet
disposition
said
at
which
nattie
smiled
to
herself
to
the
surprise
of
a
passing
gentleman
on
whom
her
unconscious
gaze
rested
and
who
thought
of
course
that
she
was
smiling
at
him
appearances
are
deceitful
i
fear
you
will
have
to
prove
your
sweetness
before
i
shall
believe
in
it
nattie
responded
to
c
all
unaware
of
what
she
had
done
or
that
the
strange
young
gentleman
went
on
his
way
with
the
firm
resolve
to
pass
by
that
office
again
and
obtain
another
smile
it
shall
be
my
sole
aim
hereafter
c
replied
and
then
asked
have
you
a
pleasant
office
there
i
regret
to
say
no
then
looking
around
and
describing
what
she
saw
a
long
dark
little
room
into
which
the
sun
never
shines
a
crazy
and
a
wooden
chair
a
high
stool
desk
instruments
that
is
all
oh
and
me
last
but
not
least
said
c
but
what
a
contrast
to
my
office
mine
is
all
windows
and
in
cold
days
like
this
the
wind
whistles
in
until
my
very
bones
rattle
the
outward
view
is
fine
as
i
sit
i
see
a
stable
a
carpenter
shop
the
roof
of
the
new
town
hall
that
has
ruined
the
town
and
excuse
me
some
one
at
another
office
on
the
line
here
broke
in
and
with
more
politeness
than
is
sometimes
shown
in
interrupting
conversations
on
the
wire
i
have
a
message
to
send
and
forthwith
began
calling
at
this
nattie
resumed
her
interrupted
occupation
of
bewailing
her
spoiled
dress
but
at
the
same
time
she
had
a
feeling
of
pleased
surprise
at
the
affability
of
c
at
x
i
wonder
she
thought
as
she
took
up
her
book
again
and
tried
to
bury
the
remembrance
of
her
accident
therein
i
do
wonder
if
this
is
or
soon
however
she
heard
x
n
call
once
more
and
this
time
she
laid
her
book
aside
very
readily
you
did
not
describe
the
principal
part
of
your
office
yourself
c
said
when
she
answered
the
call
how
can
i
describe
myself
replied
nattie
how
can
anyone
properly
one
sees
that
same
old
face
in
the
glass
day
after
day
and
becomes
so
used
to
it
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
notice
even
the
changes
in
it
so
i
am
sure
i
do
not
see
how
one
can
tell
how
it
really
does
look
unless
one
nose
is
broken
or
one
eyes
crossed
and
mine
are
not
or
one
should
not
see
a
for
a
year
i
can
only
say
i
am
very
inky
just
now
oh
that
is
too
bad
c
said
then
with
a
laugh
it
has
always
been
a
source
of
great
wonder
to
me
how
certain
very
plain
people
of
my
acquaintance
could
possibly
think
themselves
handsome
but
i
see
it
all
now
can
you
not
however
leave
the
beauty
out
and
give
me
some
sort
of
an
yourself
for
my
imagination
to
work
upon
certainly
replied
nattie
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
her
eye
that
c
knew
not
of
imagine
if
you
please
a
tall
young
man
with
c
broke
quickly
saying
oh
no
you
can
not
deceive
me
in
that
way
under
protest
i
accept
the
height
but
spurn
the
sex
why
you
do
not
suppose
i
am
a
lady
do
you
queried
nattie
i
am
quite
positive
you
are
there
is
a
certain
difference
in
the
of
a
lady
and
gentleman
that
i
have
learned
to
distinguish
can
you
truly
say
i
am
wrong
nattie
evaded
a
direct
reply
by
saying
people
who
think
they
know
so
much
are
often
deceived
now
i
make
no
surmises
about
you
but
ask
fairly
and
squarely
shall
i
call
you
miss
or
mrs
call
me
neither
call
me
plain
or
picture
if
you
like
in
place
of
your
sounder
a
blonde
girl
talking
to
you
with
pensive
cheeks
and
sunny
do
you
believe
a
word
of
it
some
one
on
the
wire
here
broke
in
wishing
probably
to
have
a
finger
in
the
pie
picture
a
hippopotamus
an
elephant
but
picture
no
fairy
judge
not
others
by
yourself
and
learn
to
speak
when
spoken
to
c
replied
to
the
unknown
then
to
you
know
the
more
mystery
there
is
about
anything
the
more
interesting
it
becomes
therefore
if
i
envelop
myself
in
all
the
mystery
possible
i
will
cherish
hopes
that
you
may
dream
of
me
but
i
am
quite
sure
you
can
with
propriety
be
called
plain
as
you
say
i
doubt
not
replied
nattie
now
as
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
home
i
shall
have
to
say
to
be
continued
in
our
next
queried
if
you
are
not
in
a
cross
mood
replied
nattie
now
that
is
a
very
unkind
suggestion
after
my
abject
apology
but
although
our
acquaintance
had
a
i
trust
it
will
have
a
happy
ending
nattie
frowned
if
you
will
promise
never
to
say
or
anything
in
the
undertaking
line
i
will
agree
never
to
say
she
said
the
will
not
be
difficult
with
all
my
heart
c
answered
and
with
this
mutual
understanding
they
bade
each
other
there
certainly
is
something
romantic
in
talking
to
a
mysterious
person
unseen
and
miles
away
thought
nattie
as
she
put
on
her
hat
but
i
would
really
like
to
know
whether
my
new
friend
employs
a
tailor
or
a
dressmaker
was
nattie
conscious
of
a
feeling
that
it
would
add
to
the
zest
of
the
romantic
acquaintance
should
the
distant
c
be
entitled
to
the
use
of
the
masculine
pronoun
perhaps
so
for
nattie
was
human
and
was
only
nineteen
chapter
ii
at
the
hotel
norman
miss
nattie
rogers
telegraph
operator
lived
as
it
were
in
two
worlds
the
one
her
office
dingy
and
curtailed
as
to
proportions
but
from
whence
she
could
wander
away
through
the
medium
of
that
slender
telegraph
wire
on
a
sort
of
electric
wings
to
distant
cities
and
towns
where
although
alone
all
day
she
did
not
lack
social
intercourse
and
where
she
could
amuse
herself
if
she
chose
by
listening
to
and
speculating
upon
the
many
messages
of
joy
or
of
sorrow
of
business
and
of
pleasure
constantly
going
over
the
wire
but
the
other
world
in
which
miss
rogers
lived
was
very
different
the
world
bounded
by
the
four
walls
of
a
back
room
at
miss
betsey
kling
it
must
be
confessed
that
there
are
more
pleasing
views
than
sheds
in
greater
or
less
degrees
of
dilapidation
a
sickly
a
line
of
flapping
sheets
an
overflowing
ash
barrel
sweeter
sounds
than
the
dulcet
notes
of
old
the
serenades
of
musical
cats
or
the
strains
of
a
cornet
played
upon
at
intervals
from
nine
to
twelve
with
the
evident
purpose
of
exhausting
superfluous
air
in
the
performer
lungs
perhaps
too
there
was
more
agreeable
company
possible
than
miss
betsey
kling
therefore
in
the
evening
sunday
and
holiday
if
not
in
the
telegraphic
world
of
miss
rogers
loneliness
and
the
unpleasant
sensation
known
as
blues
are
not
uncommon
miss
betsey
kling
who
although
in
reduced
circumstances
boasted
of
certain
blue
blood
inherited
from
dead
and
gone
ancestors
who
perhaps
would
have
been
surprised
could
they
have
known
at
this
late
day
how
very
genteel
they
were
in
life
rented
a
flat
in
hotel
norman
on
the
second
floor
of
which
she
let
one
room
not
on
account
of
the
weekly
emolument
received
therefrom
ah
no
but
for
the
sake
of
having
some
one
for
company
in
this
respect
she
was
truly
a
contrast
to
simonson
a
hundred
and
pound
widow
who
lived
in
the
remaining
suite
of
that
floor
and
who
let
every
room
she
possibly
could
in
order
as
she
frankly
confessed
to
make
both
ends
meet
for
a
constant
struggle
with
the
ways
and
means
whereby
to
live
had
quite
annihilated
any
superfluous
gentility
simonson
might
have
had
excepting
only
one
lingering
remnant
that
would
never
allow
her
to
hang
in
the
window
one
of
those
cheaply
conspicuous
placards
announcing
rooms
to
let
miss
betsey
kling
was
a
spinster
not
because
she
liked
it
but
on
account
of
circumstances
over
which
she
had
no
control
and
her
principal
object
in
life
outside
of
the
but
much
one
of
finding
her
other
self
like
her
astray
was
to
keep
watch
and
ward
over
the
affairs
of
the
occupants
of
neighboring
flats
and
see
that
they
conducted
themselves
with
the
propriety
becoming
the
neighbors
of
so
very
genteel
and
unexceptionable
a
person
as
miss
betsey
kling
in
pursuit
of
this
occupation
she
was
addicted
to
sudden
and
silent
appearances
much
after
the
manner
of
materialized
spirits
at
windows
opening
into
the
hall
and
doors
carelessly
left
ajar
she
was
however
afflicted
with
a
chronic
cold
that
somewhat
interfered
with
her
ability
to
become
a
listener
on
account
of
its
producing
an
incessant
sniffle
and
spasms
of
violent
sneezing
miss
rogers
going
home
to
that
back
room
of
hers
found
herself
still
pondering
upon
the
probable
sex
of
rather
to
her
own
chagrin
when
she
caught
her
thoughts
thus
straying
too
for
she
had
a
certain
scorn
of
anything
pertaining
to
trivial
sentiment
a
little
scorn
of
herself
she
also
had
in
fact
her
desires
reached
beyond
the
obtaining
of
the
commonplaces
with
which
so
many
are
content
to
fill
their
lives
and
she
possessed
an
ambition
too
dominant
to
allow
her
to
be
content
with
the
dead
level
of
life
therefore
it
was
that
any
happy
hours
of
forgetfulness
of
all
but
the
present
that
sometimes
came
in
her
way
were
often
followed
by
others
of
unrest
and
dissatisfaction
there
were
certain
dreams
she
indulged
in
of
the
future
now
hopefully
now
utterly
disheartened
that
she
was
so
far
away
from
their
realization
these
dreams
were
of
fame
of
fame
as
an
authoress
whether
it
was
the
true
genius
stirring
within
her
or
that
most
unfortunate
of
all
things
an
unconquerable
desire
without
the
talent
to
rise
above
mediocrity
time
alone
could
tell
compelled
by
the
failure
and
subsequent
death
of
her
father
to
support
herself
or
become
a
burden
upon
her
mother
whose
now
scanty
means
barely
sufficed
for
herself
and
two
younger
children
nattie
chose
the
more
independent
but
harder
course
for
she
was
not
the
kind
of
girl
to
sit
down
and
wait
for
some
one
to
come
along
and
marry
her
and
relieve
her
of
the
burden
of
so
from
a
telegraph
office
in
the
country
where
she
learned
the
profession
she
drifted
to
her
present
one
in
the
city
to
her
as
yet
there
was
a
certain
fascination
about
telegraphy
but
she
had
a
presentiment
that
in
time
the
charm
would
give
place
to
monotony
more
especially
as
beyond
a
certain
point
there
was
positively
no
advancement
in
the
profession
although
knowing
she
could
not
be
content
to
always
be
merely
a
telegraph
operator
she
resolved
to
like
it
as
well
and
as
long
as
she
could
since
it
was
the
best
for
the
present
as
she
lighted
the
gas
in
her
room
she
thought
not
of
these
things
that
were
so
often
in
her
mind
but
of
c
and
then
scolded
herself
for
caring
whether
that
distant
individual
was
man
or
woman
what
mattered
it
to
a
young
lady
who
felt
herself
above
flirtations
so
there
was
a
little
scowl
on
her
face
as
she
turned
around
that
did
not
lessen
when
she
beheld
miss
kling
standing
in
her
for
miss
rogers
did
not
to
speak
candidly
find
her
landlady
a
congenial
spirit
and
only
remained
upon
her
premises
because
being
there
was
a
lesser
evil
than
living
in
that
most
unhomelike
of
all
places
a
i
thought
i
would
make
you
a
call
the
unwelcome
visitor
remarked
rubbing
her
nose
that
from
constant
friction
had
become
red
and
shining
i
have
been
lonesome
i
usually
run
into
simonson
in
the
afternoon
but
she
has
been
out
since
twelve
i
ca
make
out
musingly
where
she
can
have
gone
not
that
she
is
just
the
company
i
desire
she
has
never
been
used
to
anything
above
the
common
poor
soul
and
will
say
rooms
but
she
is
better
than
no
one
and
at
least
can
appreciate
in
others
the
culture
and
standing
she
has
never
attained
and
miss
kling
sneezed
and
glanced
at
nattie
with
an
expression
that
plainly
said
her
lodger
would
do
well
to
imitate
in
this
last
respect
the
lady
in
question
i
am
very
little
acquainted
with
simonson
nattie
replied
with
a
tinge
of
scorn
curling
her
lip
for
in
truth
she
had
little
reverence
for
miss
kling
blue
blood
her
lodgers
like
her
very
much
i
believe
at
least
quimby
speaks
of
her
in
the
highest
terms
quimby
repeated
miss
kling
with
a
sniffle
of
contempt
a
blundering
awkward
creature
who
is
always
doing
or
saying
some
shocking
thing
i
know
that
he
is
neither
elegant
nor
talented
and
is
often
very
awkward
but
he
is
honest
and
and
one
is
willing
to
overlook
other
deficiencies
for
such
rare
qualities
nattie
replied
a
little
warmly
and
so
simonson
feels
i
am
confident
miss
kling
eyed
her
sharply
not
at
all
allow
me
miss
rogers
to
know
simonson
endures
his
blunders
because
as
she
says
he
can
live
on
the
interest
of
his
money
a
pinch
and
she
thinks
such
a
lodger
something
of
which
to
boast
on
a
pinch
indeed
added
miss
kling
with
a
sneeze
and
giving
the
principal
feature
in
her
face
something
very
like
the
exclamation
a
very
tight
pinch
it
would
be
i
am
thinking
then
somewhat
spitefully
she
continued
but
i
was
not
aware
miss
rogers
that
you
and
this
quimby
were
so
intimate
the
admiration
is
mutual
i
suppose
there
is
no
admiration
replied
nattie
with
a
flash
of
her
gray
eyes
inwardly
indignant
that
any
one
should
insinuate
she
admired
quimby
honest
blundering
quimby
whom
no
one
ever
allowed
a
handle
to
his
name
and
who
was
so
clever
but
like
all
clever
people
such
a
dreadful
bore
i
have
only
met
him
two
or
three
times
since
that
evening
you
introduced
us
in
the
hall
so
there
has
hardly
been
an
opportunity
for
anything
of
that
kind
you
spoke
so
warmly
miss
kling
remarked
however
conciliatingly
i
do
suppose
by
any
means
that
you
are
in
love
with
quimby
you
are
much
too
sensible
a
young
lady
for
such
folly
nattie
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
if
tired
of
the
subject
and
after
a
spasm
of
sneezing
miss
kling
continued
as
you
intimate
he
means
all
right
poor
fellow
and
that
is
more
than
i
should
be
willing
to
acknowledge
regarding
simonson
lodger
that
norton
who
calls
himself
an
artist
i
am
sure
i
never
saw
any
one
except
a
convict
wear
such
short
hair
and
miss
kling
shook
her
head
insinuatingly
from
this
beginning
to
nattie
dismay
miss
kling
proceeded
to
the
dissection
of
their
neighbors
who
lived
in
the
suite
above
celeste
fishblate
and
her
father
the
former
miss
kling
declared
was
setting
her
cap
for
quimby
fishblate
being
an
unquestionably
disagreeable
specimen
of
the
with
a
somewhat
startling
habit
of
exploding
in
short
but
expressive
sentences
never
using
more
than
three
consecutive
words
nattie
naturally
expected
to
hear
him
even
more
severely
anathematized
than
any
one
else
but
to
her
surprise
the
lady
conducting
the
conversation
declared
him
a
fine
sensible
man
at
which
nattie
first
stared
and
then
smiled
as
it
occurred
to
her
that
fishblate
was
a
widower
and
might
it
not
be
that
miss
kling
contemplated
the
possibility
of
becoming
that
other
self
not
yet
attained
fortunately
miss
kling
did
not
observe
her
lodger
looks
so
intent
was
she
in
admiration
of
fishblate
fine
points
and
soon
took
her
leave
after
her
departure
nattie
changed
her
inky
dress
and
put
on
her
hat
to
go
out
for
something
forgotten
until
now
as
she
stepped
into
the
hall
a
tall
young
man
with
extremely
long
arms
and
legs
and
mouth
that
although
shaded
by
a
faint
outline
of
a
mustache
invariably
suggested
an
alligator
opened
the
door
of
simonson
rooms
opposite
and
seeing
nattie
started
back
in
a
sort
of
nervous
bashfulness
recovering
himself
he
then
darted
out
with
such
impetuosity
that
his
foot
caught
in
a
rug
he
fell
and
went
headlong
down
stairs
dragging
with
him
a
at
which
he
clutched
in
a
vain
effort
to
save
himself
the
two
jointly
making
a
noise
that
echoed
through
the
silent
halls
and
brought
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
rooms
in
alarm
what
is
it
is
any
one
killed
shrieked
from
above
a
voice
recognizable
as
that
of
celeste
fishblate
two
names
that
could
never
by
any
possibility
sound
harmonious
what
the
matter
now
screamed
miss
kling
appearing
at
her
door
with
the
query
have
you
hurt
yourself
nattie
asked
as
she
went
down
to
where
the
hero
of
the
catastrophe
sat
on
the
bottom
stair
ruefully
rubbing
his
elbow
but
who
now
picked
up
his
hat
and
the
and
rose
to
explain
it
nothing
nothing
at
all
you
know
he
said
looking
upward
and
bowing
to
the
voices
i
caught
my
foot
in
the
rug
and
did
you
tear
the
rug
here
anxiously
interrupted
the
listening
simonson
suddenly
appearing
at
the
banisters
not
that
she
felt
for
her
lodger
less
but
for
the
rug
more
a
distinction
arising
from
that
constant
struggle
with
the
ways
and
means
oh
no
i
assure
you
there
was
no
damage
done
to
the
rug
or
the
victim
responded
reassuringly
and
in
perfect
good
faith
or
myself
he
added
modestly
as
if
the
latter
was
scarce
worth
speaking
of
i
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
reverting
to
his
usual
expression
in
accidents
of
all
descriptions
i
declare
i
do
know
what
you
will
do
next
muttered
simonson
retreating
to
examine
the
rug
i
think
you
must
be
in
love
quimby
giggled
celeste
an
assertion
that
caused
miss
kling
to
give
vent
to
a
contemptuous
humph
and
awakened
in
its
subject
the
most
excruciating
embarrassment
the
poor
fellow
glanced
at
nattie
blushed
perspired
and
frantically
clutching
at
the
stammered
a
protest
now
really
i
now
you
are
mistaken
you
know
but
people
who
are
in
love
are
always
persisted
celeste
with
another
giggle
so
it
is
useless
to
but
exactly
what
was
useless
did
not
appear
as
at
this
point
a
stentorian
voice
the
voice
of
miss
kling
fine
sensible
man
roared
enough
at
which
to
quimby
relief
celeste
always
in
mortal
fear
of
her
father
hastily
withdrew
not
so
miss
kling
she
silently
waited
to
see
if
nattie
and
quimby
would
go
out
together
and
was
rewarded
by
hearing
the
latter
ask
as
nattie
made
a
movement
towards
the
door
may
i
might
i
be
so
bold
as
to
as
to
ask
to
be
your
escort
i
should
be
pleased
nattie
answered
adding
with
a
mischievous
glance
but
in
a
low
tone
aware
of
the
listening
ears
above
that
is
if
you
will
consent
to
dispense
with
the
quimby
started
and
dropping
the
article
in
question
as
if
it
had
suddenly
turned
ejaculated
bless
my
soul
really
i
i
beg
pardon
i
am
sure
then
bashfully
offering
his
arm
they
went
out
while
miss
kling
balefully
shook
her
head
so
celeste
will
insist
upon
it
that
you
are
in
love
because
you
tripped
and
fell
down
stairs
nattie
said
by
way
of
opening
a
conversation
as
they
walked
along
a
remark
that
did
not
tend
to
lessen
his
evident
disquietude
and
having
now
no
he
clutched
at
his
necktie
twirling
it
all
awry
not
at
all
to
the
improvement
of
his
personal
appearance
as
he
replied
oh
really
you
know
its
no
matter
i
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
used
to
falling
in
love
queried
nattie
with
raised
eyebrows
no
no
the
other
you
know
that
is
gasped
quimby
hopelessly
lost
for
a
substantive
i
mean
it
a
mistake
you
know
then
with
a
desperate
rush
away
from
the
embarrassing
subject
did
you
know
we
that
is
simonson
was
going
to
have
a
new
lodger
no
is
she
asked
nattie
yes
a
young
lady
coming
a
a
sort
of
an
actress
no
a
prima
donna
you
know
a
miss
archer
if
you
and
she
should
happen
to
like
each
other
it
would
be
pleasant
for
you
now
would
it
asked
quimby
eagerly
with
a
devout
hope
that
such
might
be
for
then
should
he
not
be
a
gainer
by
seeing
more
often
the
young
lady
by
his
side
whose
gray
eyes
had
already
made
havoc
in
his
honest
and
susceptible
heart
it
would
be
pleasant
acquiesced
nattie
in
utter
unconsciousness
of
quimby
selfish
hidden
thought
for
i
am
lonely
sometimes
miss
kling
is
not
not
oh
certainly
of
course
not
quimby
responded
sympathetically
and
understandingly
as
nattie
hesitated
for
a
word
that
would
express
her
meaning
they
never
are
very
adaptable
old
maids
you
know
but
it
is
because
they
are
unmarried
said
nattie
perhaps
feeling
called
upon
to
defend
her
future
self
but
because
they
were
born
so
exactly
you
know
that
why
no
fellow
ever
marries
them
said
quimby
with
a
glance
of
bashful
admiration
at
his
companion
nattie
laughed
and
this
miss
archer
did
you
say
she
was
a
prima
donna
she
questioned
yes
that
is
a
sort
of
a
kind
of
a
one
or
going
to
be
or
some
way
musical
or
theatrical
you
know
was
quimby
lucid
reply
i
make
it
a
point
to
to
introduce
you
if
you
will
allow
me
that
pleasure
certainly
responded
nattie
and
added
i
shall
be
quite
rich
for
me
in
acquaintances
soon
if
i
continue
as
i
have
begun
i
made
a
new
one
on
the
wire
on
the
i
beg
pardon
on
the
what
asked
quimby
with
visions
of
flashing
through
his
mind
on
the
wire
repeated
nattie
to
whom
the
phrase
was
so
common
that
it
never
occurred
to
her
as
needing
any
explanation
oh
said
the
puzzled
quimby
not
at
all
comprehending
but
unwilling
to
confess
his
ignorance
the
worst
of
it
is
i
do
know
the
sex
of
my
new
friend
which
makes
it
a
little
awkward
continued
nattie
quimby
stared
do
i
beg
pardon
do
know
her
his
sex
he
repeated
with
eyes
no
it
was
on
the
wire
you
know
again
explained
nattie
privately
thinking
him
unusually
stupid
about
seventy
miles
away
we
first
quarreled
and
then
had
a
pleasant
talk
talk
seventy
miles
faltered
the
perplexed
quimby
then
brightening
oh
i
see
a
telephone
you
know
no
indeed
replied
nattie
laughing
at
his
incomprehensibility
we
do
need
telephones
we
can
talk
without
did
you
not
know
that
and
what
is
better
no
one
but
those
who
understand
our
language
can
know
what
we
say
exactly
answered
quimby
relapsing
again
into
wonder
exactly
on
the
wire
yes
we
talk
in
a
language
of
dots
and
dashes
that
even
miss
kling
might
listen
to
in
vain
and
do
you
know
she
went
on
confidentially
somehow
i
am
very
much
interested
in
my
new
friend
i
wish
i
knew
its
so
awkward
as
i
said
but
i
really
think
it
a
gentleman
exactly
exactly
so
responded
quimby
somewhat
dejectedly
and
during
the
remainder
of
their
walk
he
was
very
much
harassed
in
his
mind
over
this
interest
nattie
confessed
in
her
new
friend
on
the
wire
who
appear
as
a
performer
to
his
perturbed
imagination
and
he
felt
in
his
inmost
heart
that
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
his
mind
if
this
mysterious
person
should
prove
a
lady
even
though
if
a
gentleman
he
many
miles
away
for
quimby
with
all
his
obtusity
had
an
inkling
of
the
power
of
mystery
and
was
already
far
enough
on
the
road
to
love
to
be
jealous
of
these
thoughts
nattie
was
of
course
wholly
unaware
and
chatted
gayly
now
of
the
distant
c
and
now
of
the
coming
miss
archer
to
her
somewhat
abstracted
but
always
devoted
companion
chapter
iii
visible
and
invisible
friends
with
perhaps
one
or
two
less
frowns
than
usual
at
the
destiny
that
compelled
her
to
forego
any
morning
naps
and
be
up
and
stirring
at
the
early
hour
of
six
nattie
arose
next
morning
aware
of
a
more
than
accustomed
willingness
to
go
to
the
office
and
immediately
on
her
arrival
there
she
opened
the
key
and
said
without
calling
just
to
ascertain
if
her
acquaintance
would
notice
it
good
morning
c
apparently
c
had
his
or
her
ears
on
the
alert
for
immediately
came
the
response
my
dear
a
form
of
expression
rather
familiar
for
so
short
an
acquaintance
that
is
supposing
c
to
be
a
gentleman
but
then
people
talk
for
the
sake
of
talking
and
never
say
what
they
mean
on
the
wire
thought
nattie
besides
did
not
the
distance
in
any
case
annul
the
familiarity
therefore
without
taking
offense
even
without
comment
she
asked
are
we
to
get
along
without
quarreling
oh
it
is
you
is
it
responded
c
i
thought
so
but
quite
sure
yes
you
may
at
every
word
and
i
will
still
be
amiable
i
should
be
afraid
to
put
you
to
the
test
replied
nattie
with
a
laugh
do
you
then
think
me
such
a
hopelessly
fellow
inquired
fellow
triumphantly
repeated
nattie
be
careful
or
you
will
betray
yourself
ha
ha
laughed
stupid
enough
of
me
was
it
but
it
only
proves
the
old
adage
about
giving
a
man
rope
enough
to
hang
himself
do
mention
old
adages
for
i
detest
them
said
nattie
especially
that
one
about
the
early
bird
and
the
worm
but
i
fear
as
a
you
are
not
a
success
a
very
bad
attempt
at
a
pun
said
i
trust
however
you
will
not
desert
me
now
your
curiosity
is
satisfied
miss
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
me
i
have
said
nothing
yet
to
give
you
that
right
nattie
replied
nevertheless
it
utterly
impossible
not
to
miss
you
i
missed
you
last
night
after
you
had
gone
home
for
instance
but
a
great
hulking
fellow
no
indeed
in
my
mind
eye
but
what
was
in
c
mind
eye
did
not
just
then
appear
for
at
this
interesting
point
some
one
at
nattie
window
saying
i
would
like
to
send
a
message
obliged
her
reluctantly
to
interrupt
him
with
excuse
me
a
moment
a
customer
is
waiting
she
then
turned
as
much
of
her
attention
as
she
could
separate
from
c
to
the
customer
enabled
perhaps
to
answer
the
volley
of
miscellaneous
questions
poured
upon
her
with
unusual
affability
on
account
of
the
settlement
and
in
the
right
direction
of
that
vexed
question
of
c
sex
but
she
could
not
help
thinking
as
she
glanced
at
the
message
finally
written
and
handed
to
her
that
had
the
writer
attended
a
little
more
to
the
and
a
little
less
to
the
accumulation
of
diamond
rings
it
might
have
been
a
very
wise
proceeding
but
perhaps
meat
me
at
the
train
was
sufficiently
intelligible
for
all
purposes
what
was
it
about
your
mind
eye
nattie
asked
over
the
wire
at
the
first
opportunity
c
was
again
on
the
alert
without
being
called
for
the
answer
came
after
a
moment
just
long
enough
for
him
to
cross
the
room
perhaps
as
i
was
saying
in
the
eye
aforesaid
me
thinks
i
see
a
tall
slim
young
lady
with
blue
eyes
and
light
hair
and
dimples
that
come
into
her
cheeks
when
i
stupidly
betray
my
sex
as
c
said
this
nattie
glanced
into
the
glass
just
over
her
head
at
the
reflection
of
her
face
a
face
whose
expression
was
its
charm
that
never
could
be
called
pretty
but
that
nevertheless
suggested
a
possibility
only
a
possibility
of
being
handsome
for
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
pretty
and
handsome
pretty
people
seldom
know
very
much
but
to
be
handsome
a
person
must
have
brains
an
inner
as
well
as
an
outer
beauty
how
fortunate
it
is
you
are
not
near
enough
to
be
disenchanted
nattie
replied
to
your
mind
eye
is
very
unreliable
tall
why
only
five
feet
never
was
guilty
of
a
dimple
and
my
eyes
are
of
some
dreadfully
nondescript
color
if
you
are
only
five
feet
you
never
can
look
down
on
me
which
is
a
great
consolation
c
responded
and
for
the
rest
imagination
will
clothe
the
unseen
with
all
possible
beauty
and
grace
i
am
sure
i
am
perfectly
willing
you
should
imagine
me
as
beautiful
as
you
please
replied
nattie
as
long
as
we
do
come
face
to
face
which
in
all
probability
we
never
shall
you
will
not
know
how
different
from
the
real
was
the
ideal
please
do
discourage
me
so
soon
for
i
hope
sometime
we
may
clasp
hands
bodily
as
we
do
now
spiritually
on
the
wire
for
we
do
we
said
c
asserting
before
he
questioned
certainly
here
is
mine
spiritually
responded
nattie
without
the
least
hesitation
as
she
thought
of
the
miles
of
safe
distance
between
now
may
i
ask
oh
come
come
this
will
never
do
you
are
getting
on
altogether
too
fast
for
people
who
were
quarreling
so
yesterday
broke
in
a
third
party
who
signed
em
and
was
a
young
lady
of
nattie
some
twenty
miles
distant
you
think
the
circuit
of
our
friendship
ought
to
be
broken
queried
nattie
ah
leave
that
to
time
and
change
by
which
all
circuits
are
broken
remarked
yes
but
such
a
sudden
friendship
is
sure
to
come
to
a
violent
end
em
said
suppose
now
i
should
report
you
for
talking
so
much
not
to
say
flirting
on
the
wire
which
is
against
the
rules
you
know
in
that
event
i
should
know
how
to
be
revenged
replied
i
should
put
on
my
wire
and
cut
off
communication
between
you
and
that
little
fellow
at
z
em
laughed
and
perhaps
feeling
herself
rather
weak
on
that
point
subsided
and
nattie
began
sentiment
but
the
pretty
little
speech
on
that
subject
she
had
all
ready
was
spoiled
by
an
operator
who
evidently
had
none
of
it
in
his
soul
usurping
the
wire
with
the
prefaced
remark
get
out
the
wire
being
unusually
busy
this
was
all
the
conversation
nattie
and
c
had
during
the
day
but
just
before
six
came
the
call
b
m
b
m
b
m
x
b
m
immediately
responded
nattie
i
merely
want
to
ask
for
my
character
before
saying
good
night
have
i
been
amiable
was
asked
from
x
very
but
there
is
no
merit
in
it
as
mark
tapley
would
say
replied
nattie
you
had
no
provocation
now
i
flattered
myself
i
had
out
strong
alas
what
a
hard
thing
it
is
to
establish
one
reputation
said
c
sagely
but
i
trust
to
time
who
after
all
is
a
pretty
good
fellow
to
right
matters
notwithstanding
a
dreadful
careless
way
he
has
of
strewing
crow
feet
and
wrinkles
has
he
dropped
any
down
your
way
asked
nattie
hinting
to
know
my
age
now
are
you
oh
curiosity
curiosity
yes
i
think
he
has
implanted
a
perceptible
crow
foot
or
two
but
he
has
spared
the
hairs
of
my
head
and
for
that
i
am
thankful
did
you
ever
see
an
aged
operator
i
never
did
and
do
know
whether
it
because
electricity
acts
as
a
sort
of
antidote
or
whether
they
grow
wise
as
they
grow
old
and
leave
the
business
the
case
is
respectfully
submitted
your
organs
of
discernment
must
be
very
fully
developed
nattie
replied
it
is
fortunate
i
am
too
far
away
to
be
analyzed
personally
but
i
do
think
i
will
stay
after
hours
to
discuss
these
things
to
night
i
am
tired
for
i
have
had
a
run
of
disagreeable
people
so
my
dear
said
the
gallant
c
in
whose
composition
bashfulness
seemed
certainly
to
have
no
part
but
then
as
nattie
previously
had
thought
he
was
along
way
off
it
must
be
confessed
c
could
hardly
fail
to
have
been
flattered
had
he
known
how
full
nattie
thoughts
were
of
him
as
she
went
home
that
night
a
little
foolish
in
the
young
lady
who
rather
prided
herself
on
being
this
deep
interest
but
hers
was
a
lonely
life
poor
girl
and
c
was
certainly
entertaining
over
the
wire
whatever
he
might
be
in
a
personal
interview
of
course
not
very
likely
to
occur
no
it
was
all
over
the
wire
as
she
reached
her
own
door
absorbed
in
these
meditations
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
merry
laugh
over
in
simonson
and
saw
a
large
trunk
in
the
hall
from
this
she
inferred
that
miss
archer
had
arrived
a
fact
miss
kling
confirmed
with
uplifted
eyebrows
and
the
remark
there
must
be
something
wrong
about
a
young
woman
who
has
immense
trunks
although
nattie
felt
a
desire
to
make
this
newcomer
acquaintance
it
was
less
strong
than
it
might
have
been
had
she
arrived
a
week
sooner
for
it
was
undoubtedly
true
that
the
interest
she
had
in
her
new
invisible
friend
far
exceeded
that
towards
a
possible
visible
one
such
is
the
power
of
mystery
the
office
now
possessed
a
new
charm
for
her
to
the
surprise
of
an
idle
clerk
in
an
office
over
the
way
who
had
always
noted
how
particular
she
was
to
arrive
at
exactly
eight
and
to
leave
precisely
at
six
she
suddenly
began
to
appear
before
hours
in
the
morning
and
to
stay
after
hours
at
night
of
course
this
benighted
person
was
not
aware
that
by
so
doing
she
secured
quiet
chats
with
c
uninterrupted
and
without
being
told
in
the
middle
of
some
pretty
speech
to
shut
up
or
to
keep
out
by
some
soured
and
inelegant
operator
on
the
line
to
whom
the
romance
of
telegraphy
had
long
ago
given
place
to
the
monotonous
everyday
reality
and
it
came
to
pass
that
c
soon
shared
all
her
daily
life
thoughts
and
troubles
annoyances
became
lighter
because
she
told
him
and
he
sympathized
any
funny
incident
that
occurred
was
doubly
funny
because
they
laughed
over
it
together
and
so
it
went
on
that
dear
previously
unchallenged
became
a
regular
institution
and
still
on
account
of
those
long
miles
between
them
nattie
made
only
a
faint
remonstrance
when
his
usual
morning
salutation
grew
into
little
girl
at
b
m
then
was
shortened
to
little
girl
and
all
this
time
it
never
occurred
to
them
that
excepting
n
was
for
nattie
and
c
for
clem
they
knew
really
nothing
about
each
other
not
even
their
names
thus
the
acquaintance
went
on
amid
much
banter
from
the
and
interruptions
from
disgusted
old
settlers
it
was
by
no
means
to
the
satisfaction
of
quimby
that
miss
rogers
should
thus
allow
the
telegraphic
world
to
supersede
the
one
in
which
he
had
a
part
that
intimacy
with
miss
archer
of
which
he
had
dreamed
as
a
means
of
improving
his
own
acquaintance
with
her
towards
whom
his
susceptible
heart
yearned
did
not
make
even
a
beginning
in
fact
what
with
nattie
being
engaged
all
day
and
stopping
after
hours
for
a
quiet
talk
with
c
and
miss
archer
having
many
evening
engagements
the
two
had
never
even
met
and
how
a
young
man
was
to
make
himself
agreeable
in
the
eyes
of
a
young
lady
he
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
occasionally
was
a
problem
quite
beyond
solution
by
the
brain
of
quimby
two
or
three
times
in
his
distraction
of
mind
he
had
stood
in
very
light
clothing
about
nattie
hour
of
returning
home
full
minutes
at
the
outer
door
of
the
hotel
with
a
cold
wind
blowing
on
him
but
nattie
utterly
unconscious
of
this
devotion
was
enjoying
the
conversation
of
c
and
so
at
last
half
frozen
poor
quimby
was
compelled
to
retreat
his
object
unaccomplished
he
would
willingly
have
wandered
about
the
halls
for
hours
and
waylaid
her
had
it
not
been
that
the
fear
of
those
two
terrific
ones
miss
kling
and
fishblate
catching
him
at
it
prevailed
over
all
other
considerations
as
for
going
to
her
office
quimby
in
his
bashfulness
dared
not
even
walk
through
the
street
containing
it
lest
she
should
penetrate
his
motives
and
be
offended
at
his
presumption
under
these
circumstances
he
began
to
despair
of
ever
having
the
opportunity
to
say
nothing
of
the
ability
of
making
an
impression
when
one
afternoon
he
chanced
to
meet
miss
archer
in
the
vicinity
of
nattie
office
and
was
instantly
overwhelmed
by
a
brilliant
idea
that
was
to
ask
miss
archer
to
whom
he
had
talked
much
of
nattie
during
their
short
acquaintance
if
she
would
call
on
her
with
him
omitting
the
fact
that
he
dared
not
go
alone
miss
archer
a
little
curious
to
see
the
lady
with
whom
she
was
secretly
convinced
quimbv
was
in
love
readily
consented
to
the
proposition
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
nattie
was
interrupted
in
an
account
she
was
giving
c
of
a
man
who
wanted
to
send
a
message
to
his
wife
and
seemed
to
think
my
wife
in
providence
all
the
address
necessary
by
the
unexpected
apparition
of
quimby
accompanied
by
a
stylish
and
handsome
young
lady
i
i
beg
pardon
if
i
if
i
intrude
you
know
he
stammered
beginning
to
wish
he
had
not
done
it
as
nattie
with
an
excuse
me
visitors
to
c
rose
and
came
forward
but
i
i
brought
miss
archer
to
make
you
acquainted
you
know
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
that
pleasure
nattie
said
with
a
smile
as
she
took
the
hand
miss
archer
extended
saying
i
have
heard
quimby
speak
about
you
so
much
i
already
feel
acquainted
quimby
blushed
and
nervously
fingered
his
necktie
such
near
neighbors
so
lonesome
thought
you
ought
to
know
each
other
he
said
confusedly
yes
i
began
to
fear
we
were
destined
never
to
meet
nattie
replied
as
she
held
the
private
door
open
for
her
visitors
to
enter
a
proceeding
contrary
to
rules
but
she
preferred
rather
to
transgress
in
this
way
than
in
manners
and
leave
her
callers
standing
out
in
the
cold
i
do
know
as
we
ever
should
had
it
not
been
for
quimby
said
miss
archer
glancing
curiously
around
the
office
i
believe
i
never
was
in
a
telegraph
office
before
do
you
find
the
confinement
rather
irksome
sometimes
nattie
replied
but
then
there
always
is
some
one
to
talk
with
on
the
wire
and
in
that
way
a
good
deal
of
the
time
passes
talk
with
on
the
wire
queried
miss
archer
with
uplifted
eyebrows
what
does
that
mean
do
tell
me
i
am
as
ignorant
as
a
hottentot
about
anything
appertaining
to
telegraphy
nearly
all
i
know
is
you
write
a
message
pay
for
it
and
it
goes
nattie
smiled
and
explained
and
then
turning
to
quimby
asked
you
remember
my
speaking
about
and
wondering
whether
a
gentleman
or
lady
oh
yes
quimby
remembered
and
fidgeted
on
his
chair
he
proved
to
be
a
gentleman
oh
yes
exactly
you
know
responded
quimby
looking
anything
but
elated
it
must
be
very
romantic
and
fascinating
to
talk
with
some
one
so
far
away
a
mysterious
stranger
too
that
one
has
never
seen
miss
archer
said
her
black
eyes
sparkling
i
should
get
up
a
nice
little
sentimental
affair
immediately
i
know
i
should
there
is
something
so
nice
about
anything
with
a
mystery
to
it
yes
telegraphy
has
its
romantic
side
it
would
be
dreadfully
dull
if
it
did
not
nattie
answered
but
now
really
said
quimby
who
sat
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
chair
with
his
feet
some
two
yards
apart
from
each
other
really
you
know
now
suppose
just
suppose
your
mysterious
invisible
be
just
what
you
think
you
know
you
see
i
remember
one
or
two
young
men
in
telegraph
offices
whose
collars
and
cuffs
are
always
soiled
you
know
i
have
great
faith
in
my
laughed
nattie
it
would
be
dreadfully
unromantic
to
fall
in
love
with
a
soiled
invisible
would
it
said
miss
archer
with
an
expressive
shrug
of
her
shoulders
nattie
colored
a
little
and
answered
hastily
oh
it
only
fun
you
know
at
which
quimby
brightened
and
miss
archer
inquired
gayly
passer
le
temps
nattie
nodded
in
reply
as
she
took
a
message
from
a
lady
who
had
only
a
few
words
to
send
but
found
it
necessary
to
ask
about
fifteen
questions
and
relate
all
her
recent
family
history
concluding
with
the
birth
of
twins
before
being
satisfied
her
message
would
go
all
right
a
proceeding
that
made
quimby
stare
and
afforded
miss
archer
much
amusement
oh
that
is
nothing
nattie
said
in
answer
to
the
significant
laugh
when
the
customer
had
retired
some
very
ludicrous
incidents
occur
almost
daily
i
assure
you
truly
the
ignorance
of
people
in
regard
to
telegraphy
is
surprising
aggravating
too
sometimes
just
imagine
a
person
thinking
a
telegraph
office
is
managed
on
the
same
principle
as
those
stores
where
they
at
first
charge
double
the
value
of
the
goods
for
the
sake
of
giving
people
the
pleasure
of
beating
them
down
it
was
only
yesterday
that
a
woman
tried
to
coax
me
to
take
off
ten
cents
and
then
snarled
at
me
because
i
would
and
declared
she
would
patronize
some
other
office
next
time
as
if
it
mattered
to
me
except
to
wish
she
might
and
there
was
some
one
calling
on
the
wire
with
a
rush
message
all
the
time
she
was
detaining
me
they
think
you
ought
to
be
harnessed
with
a
punch
like
a
conductor
said
miss
archer
laughing
and
added
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
telegraph
i
would
have
a
chat
with
your
i
am
getting
very
much
interested
in
him
quimby
twirled
his
hat
uneasily
but
i
beg
pardon
but
he
may
be
a
soiled
invisible
you
know
he
hinted
seemingly
determined
to
keep
this
possibility
uppermost
before
nattie
could
again
defend
her
c
a
woman
covered
with
cheap
finery
thrust
her
head
into
the
window
how
much
does
it
cost
to
telegram
she
asked
to
what
place
did
you
wish
to
send
nattie
inquired
with
a
look
as
if
she
considered
this
a
very
impertinent
question
the
woman
replied
with
a
slight
toss
of
her
head
it
no
matter
about
the
place
i
only
want
to
know
what
it
costs
to
telegram
that
depends
entirely
on
where
the
message
is
going
answered
nattie
with
a
glance
at
miss
archer
oh
does
it
said
the
woman
looking
surprised
well
to
chicago
then
nattie
told
her
the
tariff
to
that
city
is
that
the
cheapest
she
then
asked
i
only
want
to
send
a
few
words
about
six
the
price
is
the
same
for
one
or
ten
words
said
nattie
rather
impatiently
the
woman
gave
another
surprised
stare
that
strange
she
said
incredulously
well
moving
away
write
then
i
am
not
going
to
pay
for
ten
words
when
i
want
to
send
six
that
is
a
specimen
of
the
ignorance
you
were
just
speaking
of
i
presume
laughed
miss
archer
as
soon
as
the
sender
was
out
of
hearing
yes
replied
nattie
it
hard
to
make
them
believe
sometimes
that
everything
less
than
ten
words
is
a
stated
price
and
that
we
only
charge
per
word
after
that
number
and
speaking
of
ignorance
do
you
know
i
once
actually
had
a
letter
brought
me
all
sealed
to
be
sent
that
way
by
telegraph
miss
archer
laughed
again
and
quimby
inquired
i
i
beg
pardon
but
did
i
understand
that
the
last
came
within
your
experience
yes
nattie
replied
and
i
had
a
young
woman
come
in
here
once
who
asked
me
to
write
the
message
for
her
and
after
i
had
done
so
in
a
somewhat
hasty
scrawl
she
took
it
looked
it
all
over
critically
dotted
some
and
crossed
some
i
all
the
time
staring
amazed
and
wondering
if
she
supposed
i
could
not
read
my
own
then
scowled
and
threw
it
down
disgustedly
saying
never
can
read
i
shall
have
to
write
it
myself
he
knows
my
writing
can
such
things
be
cried
miss
archer
but
asked
quimby
from
his
uncomfortable
perch
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
is
there
a
a
something
a
arrangement
i
believe
there
is
but
it
is
not
yet
perfected
replied
nattie
ah
well
then
the
young
woman
was
only
in
advance
of
the
age
said
miss
archer
and
what
with
that
and
the
telephone
and
that
dreadful
phonograph
that
bottles
up
all
one
says
and
disgorges
at
inconvenient
times
we
will
soon
be
able
to
do
everything
by
electricity
who
knows
but
some
genius
will
invent
something
for
the
especial
use
of
lovers
something
for
instance
to
carry
in
their
pockets
so
when
they
are
far
away
from
each
other
and
pine
for
a
sound
of
beloved
voice
they
will
have
only
to
take
up
this
electrical
apparatus
put
it
to
their
ears
and
be
happy
ah
blissful
lovers
of
the
future
yes
i
yes
that
would
be
a
good
idea
cried
quimby
eagerly
then
instantly
fearing
he
had
betrayed
himself
turned
red
and
clutched
at
the
mustache
that
eluded
his
grasp
miss
archer
looked
at
him
and
smiled
and
nattie
was
about
to
expound
further
when
she
heard
c
asking
on
the
wire
n
have
your
visitors
gone
yet
tell
them
to
hurry
you
would
say
so
nattie
responded
to
him
if
you
knew
what
a
handsome
young
lady
one
of
my
two
visitors
is
we
have
been
talking
about
you
too
introduce
me
please
do
said
what
are
you
doing
now
asked
miss
archer
watchful
of
smiling
face
leaving
the
key
open
nattie
explained
to
quimby
unconcealed
dissatisfaction
but
miss
archer
was
delighted
oh
do
introduce
me
can
you
any
way
she
said
nattie
nodded
affirmatively
and
taking
hold
of
the
key
wrote
she
is
as
anxious
as
you
are
so
allow
me
to
make
you
acquainted
with
miss
archer
a
young
lady
with
the
prettiest
black
eyes
i
ever
saw
is
she
an
operator
asked
does
know
a
dot
from
a
dash
nattie
answered
him
then
tell
her
in
plain
language
that
this
is
the
happiest
moment
of
my
life
and
also
that
black
eyes
are
my
especial
adoration
what
have
you
been
telling
him
about
me
you
dreadful
girl
queried
miss
archer
shaking
her
head
remonstratingly
when
this
was
repeated
to
her
but
you
may
inform
him
i
am
delighted
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
hope
he
has
curly
hair
because
it
so
nice
to
pull
with
the
hope
of
such
a
happy
occurrence
i
will
hereafter
do
up
my
hair
in
papers
c
replied
when
nattie
had
repeated
this
to
him
but
do
not
slight
your
other
visitor
shall
i
introduce
you
asked
nattie
holding
the
key
open
and
turning
to
quimby
who
had
betrayed
various
symptoms
of
uneasiness
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
and
who
now
grasped
his
hat
firmly
as
if
to
throw
it
at
the
little
sounder
that
represented
the
offending
c
and
answered
oh
no
i
really
i
i
beg
pardon
but
it
really
no
matter
about
me
you
know
he
says
he
is
of
no
consequence
nattie
said
to
he
repeated
c
a
he
is
it
ought
i
to
be
jealous
is
it
you
or
our
friend
who
is
the
attraction
nattie
replied
only
with
a
ha
is
he
talking
now
asked
miss
archer
mindful
of
nattie
smile
and
nodding
towards
the
clattering
sounder
at
which
quimby
was
scowling
no
some
other
office
is
sending
business
now
so
our
conversation
is
suspended
answered
nattie
as
much
to
quimby
relief
as
to
miss
archer
regret
i
shall
improve
the
acquaintance
however
the
latter
said
i
am
very
curious
to
know
how
he
looks
are
you
yes
but
i
do
not
suppose
i
ever
shall
nattie
answered
then
you
i
beg
pardon
but
you
never
expect
to
see
him
queried
quimby
with
great
earnestness
in
all
probability
we
never
shall
meet
i
think
i
should
be
dreadfully
embarrassed
if
we
should
nattie
replied
as
she
handed
the
day
cash
to
the
boy
who
just
then
came
after
it
face
to
face
we
would
really
be
strangers
to
each
other
quimby
evinced
more
satisfaction
at
this
than
the
occasion
seemed
to
warrant
as
nattie
noticed
with
some
surprise
but
several
customers
claiming
her
attention
all
at
once
and
all
in
a
hurry
she
was
kept
too
busy
for
some
time
to
think
upon
the
cause
as
soon
as
she
was
at
leisure
miss
archer
with
the
remark
that
they
had
made
an
unpardonably
long
call
arose
to
go
but
you
must
certainly
come
again
nattie
said
cordially
already
feeling
her
to
be
an
old
friend
indeed
i
shall
she
answered
in
the
genial
way
peculiar
to
her
you
have
a
double
attraction
here
you
know
can
i
say
to
i
fear
not
as
the
wire
is
busy
replied
nattie
but
i
will
say
it
for
you
as
soon
as
possible
yes
tell
him
please
that
i
will
see
him
i
mean
hear
the
clatter
he
makes
again
soon
you
i
shall
see
at
the
hotel
i
hope
now
we
have
met
oh
yes
nattie
replied
i
am
very
much
indebted
to
quimby
for
making
us
acquainted
oh
really
now
do
you
mean
it
exclaimed
quimby
with
sudden
delight
i
am
so
glad
i
done
something
right
at
last
you
know
always
doing
something
wrong
you
know
then
hugging
his
hat
to
his
breast
and
speaking
in
a
confidential
whisper
he
added
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
two
girls
i
have
a
presentiment
a
horrible
presentiment
always
making
mistakes
you
see
i
used
to
it
but
i
could
get
used
to
you
know
that
some
day
i
shall
marry
the
wrong
woman
so
saying
and
with
a
last
glance
of
implacable
dislike
at
the
sounder
quimby
bowed
awkwardly
and
departed
with
the
laughing
miss
archer
soon
after
their
departure
c
asked
has
susan
gone
yes
responded
nattie
she
left
a
for
you
and
means
to
improve
your
acquaintance
thrice
happy
i
but
about
this
he
who
is
this
he
i
want
to
know
all
about
him
is
he
a
hated
rival
ha
i
never
heard
him
say
so
but
i
will
ask
him
if
you
wish
he
lives
in
the
same
building
with
me
and
brought
miss
archer
a
down
to
introduce
her
do
you
ever
go
to
balls
concerts
theaters
or
to
ride
with
him
asked
c
who
seemed
determined
to
make
a
thorough
investigation
of
matters
dear
me
no
he
never
asked
me
do
you
wish
he
would
persisted
of
course
i
do
replied
nattie
somewhat
regardless
of
truth
it
is
my
opinion
i
shall
be
obliged
to
come
and
look
after
you
c
replied
at
this
admission
but
you
would
know
whether
you
were
looking
after
the
right
person
or
not
when
you
were
here
nattie
said
with
a
smiling
face
and
sparkling
eyes
turned
in
the
direction
of
an
urchin
flattening
his
nose
against
her
who
immediately
fled
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
at
being
as
he
supposed
so
smiled
upon
and
why
would
i
questioned
because
i
should
recognize
you
immediately
and
should
pretend
it
was
not
i
but
some
substitute
replied
nattie
you
seem
to
be
very
positive
about
recognizing
me
is
your
intuitive
bump
so
as
all
that
asked
yes
nattie
responded
and
then
you
know
there
would
be
a
twinkle
in
your
eye
that
would
betray
you
at
once
indeed
we
will
see
about
that
young
lady
but
now
as
a
customer
has
been
drumming
on
my
shelf
for
the
past
five
minutes
in
a
frantic
endeavor
to
attract
my
attention
and
has
by
this
time
worked
himself
into
a
fine
irascible
temper
because
i
will
not
even
glance
at
him
i
must
bid
you
with
the
advice
watch
for
that

chapter
iv
neighborly
calls
in
the
opinion
of
miss
betsey
kling
a
lone
young
woman
who
possessed
three
large
trunks
a
more
than
average
share
of
good
looks
and
who
went
out
and
came
in
at
irregular
and
hours
was
a
person
to
be
looked
after
and
inquired
about
accordingly
while
miss
archer
was
making
the
acquaintance
of
nattie
and
of
the
invisible
c
miss
kling
descended
upon
simonson
with
the
object
of
dragging
from
that
lady
all
possible
information
she
might
be
possessed
of
regarding
her
latest
lodger
as
a
result
miss
kling
learned
that
miss
archer
was
studying
to
become
an
opera
singer
that
she
occasionally
now
sang
at
concerts
meeting
with
encouraging
success
and
further
that
she
possessed
the
best
of
references
but
miss
kling
gave
a
sniffle
of
distrust
public
characters
are
not
to
be
trusted
do
you
remember
she
asked
solemnly
do
you
remember
the
young
man
you
once
had
here
who
ran
away
with
your
teaspoons
and
your
toothbrush
ah
yes
simonson
remembered
him
perfectly
was
she
likely
to
forget
him
but
he
simonson
respectfully
submitted
was
not
a
singer
but
a
commercial
traveler
miss
kling
shook
her
head
that
experience
should
be
a
warning
you
can
not
deny
that
no
young
woman
of
a
modest
and
retiring
disposition
would
seek
to
place
herself
in
a
public
position
can
you
imagine
upon
the
stage
concluded
miss
kling
with
great
dignity
simonson
was
free
to
admit
that
her
imagination
could
contemplate
no
such
possibility
and
then
neither
desirous
of
criticising
a
good
paying
lodger
or
of
offending
miss
kling
that
struggle
with
the
ways
and
means
having
taught
her
to
offend
no
one
if
it
could
possibly
be
avoided
she
changed
the
subject
by
expatiating
at
length
upon
a
topic
she
always
found
safe
the
weather
but
miss
celeste
fishblate
coming
in
miss
kling
left
the
weather
to
take
care
of
itself
and
returned
to
the
more
interesting
discussion
to
her
of
miss
archer
celeste
a
young
lady
favored
with
a
countenance
that
impressed
the
beholder
as
being
principally
nose
and
teeth
and
possessing
a
large
share
of
the
commodity
known
as
was
ready
enough
to
be
the
recipient
of
her
neighbor
collection
of
gossip
but
to
miss
no
small
disgust
she
was
rather
lukewarm
in
the
in
truth
although
somewhat
alarmed
at
the
three
trunks
lest
she
should
be
she
was
already
debating
within
herself
whether
miss
archer
as
a
medium
by
which
more
frequent
access
to
simonson
gentlemen
lodgers
could
be
obtained
was
not
a
person
whose
acquaintance
it
was
desirable
to
cultivate
moreover
the
words
opera
singer
raised
ecstatic
visions
of
a
possible
future
introduction
to
some
ravishing
tenor
the
remote
idea
of
which
caused
her
to
be
so
visibly
preoccupied
that
miss
kling
took
her
leave
with
angry
sniffles
and
returned
home
to
ponder
over
what
she
had
heard
a
few
days
after
nattie
who
had
quite
paralyzed
miss
kling
by
refusing
to
listen
to
what
she
boldly
termed
unfounded
gossip
about
her
new
friend
went
to
spend
an
evening
with
her
miss
archer
occupied
a
suite
of
rooms
consisting
of
a
parlor
and
a
very
small
that
had
been
simonson
own
but
which
on
account
of
the
ways
and
means
she
had
given
up
now
confining
herself
exclusively
to
the
kitchen
fitted
up
to
look
as
much
like
a
parlor
as
a
kitchen
could
and
how
is
asked
miss
archer
as
she
warmly
welcomed
her
visitor
still
as
agreeable
as
ever
nattie
replied
i
told
him
i
was
coming
to
see
you
this
evening
and
he
sent
his
regards
and
wished
he
could
be
of
the
party
i
wish
he
might
but
that
would
spoil
the
mystery
rejoined
miss
archer
do
you
know
what
the
is
for
he
says
his
other
name
i
do
know
he
would
give
me
some
outlandish
cognomen
if
i
should
ask
but
it
is
of
much
consequence
it
might
be
if
you
should
really
fall
in
love
with
him
laughed
miss
archer
fall
in
love
over
the
wire
that
is
absurd
especially
as
i
am
not
susceptible
nattie
answered
coloring
a
trifle
however
as
she
remembered
how
utterly
disconsolate
she
had
been
all
that
morning
because
a
cross
on
the
wire
had
for
several
hours
cut
off
communication
between
her
office
and
x
you
think
it
would
be
too
romantic
for
real
life
doubtless
you
are
right
and
the
funny
incidents
have
you
anything
new
in
your
only
that
a
man
who
had
perhaps
just
dined
wanted
to
know
the
tariff
to
the
u
nited
st
at
ates
answered
nattie
glancing
at
some
autumn
leaves
tastefully
arranged
on
the
walls
and
curtains
but
was
telling
me
about
a
mistake
that
was
lately
made
not
by
him
he
vehemently
asserts
although
i
am
inclined
to
think
it
message
as
originally
sent
was
is
dead
be
at
home
at
three
when
it
was
delivered
it
read
is
dead
home
at
three
how
was
that
possible
asked
miss
archer
laughing
i
suppose
the
sending
operator
did
not
leave
space
enough
between
the
words
we
leave
a
small
space
between
letters
and
a
longer
one
between
words
explained
nattie
the
operator
who
received
it
must
have
been
rather
stupid
not
to
have
seen
the
mistake
miss
archer
said
i
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
your
to
believe
it
was
he
but
every
profession
has
its
comic
side
as
well
as
its
tricks
i
suppose
mine
i
am
sure
does
but
i
am
learning
something
every
day
and
i
am
determined
energetically
to
fight
my
way
up
stirred
by
miss
archer
earnestness
there
came
to
nattie
an
uneasy
consciousness
that
she
herself
was
making
no
progress
towards
her
only
dreamed
of
ambition
and
a
shade
crossed
her
face
but
without
observing
it
miss
archer
continued
i
always
had
a
passion
for
the
lyric
stage
and
now
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
did
a
slight
shadow
here
darken
also
her
sunny
eyes
gone
instantly
i
shall
make
music
my
life
aim
fortunately
i
have
money
of
my
own
to
enable
me
to
study
and
miss
archer
speech
was
here
interrupted
in
a
somewhat
startling
manner
by
the
door
suddenly
flying
open
banging
against
the
piano
with
a
prodigious
crash
and
disclosing
quimby
red
and
abashed
outside
nattie
jumped
miss
archer
gave
a
little
scream
and
the
duchess
simonson
handsome
cat
so
named
from
her
extreme
dignity
who
lay
at
full
length
upon
a
rug
drew
herself
up
in
haughty
displeasure
i
i
beg
pardon
i
am
sure
stammered
the
more
agitated
intruder
really
i
i
am
so
ashamed
i
i
can
hardly
speak
i
was
unfortunate
enough
to
stumble
i
used
to
it
you
know
and
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
i
never
saw
such
a
such
an
extremely
lively
door
it
is
of
no
consequence
miss
archer
assured
him
will
you
come
in
thank
you
i
i
fear
i
intrude
answered
quimby
clutching
his
and
glancing
at
nattie
guiltily
conscious
of
the
strong
desire
to
do
so
that
had
taken
possession
of
him
since
the
sound
of
her
voice
had
penetrated
to
his
apartment
and
in
perfect
agony
lest
she
should
surmise
it
however
upon
miss
archer
assuring
him
that
they
would
be
very
glad
of
his
company
he
ventured
to
enter
but
the
door
still
weighed
upon
his
mind
for
after
carefully
closing
it
he
stood
and
stared
at
it
with
a
very
perplexed
face
never
saw
such
a
lively
door
you
know
he
repeated
finally
sitting
down
on
the
and
folding
both
arms
across
one
knee
letting
a
hand
droop
dismally
on
either
side
while
he
looked
alternately
at
miss
archer
nattie
and
the
part
of
the
room
mentioned
at
which
the
former
laughed
and
then
with
the
kind
intention
of
drawing
his
mind
from
the
subject
of
his
forced
appearance
suggested
a
game
of
cards
then
we
shall
have
to
have
one
more
person
shall
we
not
nattie
asked
at
this
proposition
it
would
be
better
replied
miss
archer
let
me
see
simonson
does
not
play
norton
does
interrupted
quimby
forgetting
the
door
in
his
eagerness
to
be
of
service
i
i
would
willingly
ask
him
to
join
us
if
you
will
allow
me
that
queer
young
artist
who
lodges
here
you
mean
inquired
miss
archer
oh
but
he
is
a
dreadful
bohemian
commented
nattie
distrustfully
before
quimby
could
reply
is
he
laughed
miss
archer
then
ask
him
in
by
all
means
i
am
something
of
a
bohemian
myself
and
shall
be
delighted
to
meet
a
kindred
soul
i
do
not
know
as
i
have
ever
observed
the
gentleman
particularly
but
if
i
remember
rightly
he
wears
his
hair
very
closely
cropped
and
is
not
a
model
of
beauty
but
he
is
just
as
nice
a
fellow
as
if
he
was
handsome
outside
said
quimby
earnestly
doubtless
aware
of
his
own
shortcomings
in
the
adonis
line
he
is
a
little
queer
to
be
sure
does
believe
in
love
or
sentiment
or
anything
of
that
sort
you
know
and
he
says
he
wears
his
hair
cropped
close
because
people
have
a
general
idea
that
artists
are
lackadaisical
fellows
not
to
say
untidy
you
know
and
he
is
determined
that
no
one
shall
be
able
to
say
it
of
him
miss
archer
was
much
amused
at
this
description
he
certainly
is
an
odd
genius
and
decidedly
worth
knowing
bring
him
in
i
beg
of
you
she
said
but
quimby
hesitated
and
glanced
at
nattie
he
is
not
very
unconventional
i
i
do
not
think
he
will
shock
you
very
much
if
you
do
not
get
him
at
it
you
know
he
said
to
her
apologetically
oh
i
am
not
at
all
alarmed
said
nattie
adding
as
her
thoughts
reverted
to
miss
kling
i
think
after
all
a
bohemian
is
better
than
a
perfect
model
of
conventionalism
miss
archer
heartily
indorsed
this
sentiment
and
quimby
went
in
quest
of
norton
with
whom
he
soon
returned
unlike
enough
to
the
melancholy
artist
of
romantic
fame
was
norton
short
rather
stout
inclined
to
be
red
in
the
face
scrupulously
neat
in
dress
clean
shaven
and
hair
all
this
the
observing
miss
archer
saw
at
a
glance
as
she
bowed
to
him
in
response
to
quimby
introduction
but
the
second
glance
showed
her
that
the
expression
of
his
face
was
so
jovial
that
its
plainness
vanished
as
if
by
magic
on
his
first
smile
if
nattie
possibly
a
trifle
prejudiced
in
his
disfavor
expected
him
to
outrage
common
propriety
in
some
way
such
as
keeping
on
his
hat
smoking
a
black
pipe
or
turning
up
his
pantaloons
leg
she
was
utterly
shall
we
say
disappointed
truth
to
tell
before
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
from
the
time
of
his
arrival
she
was
wishing
she
knew
more
bohemians
and
even
hoping
c
was
one
at
home
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
in
a
very
short
time
the
strangers
of
a
moment
ago
were
his
friends
full
of
anecdotes
and
quaint
remarks
he
was
the
life
of
the
little
party
miss
archer
however
was
a
very
able
backer
cyn
as
they
all
found
themselves
calling
her
soon
after
jo
norton
advent
and
forevermore
cyn
was
as
its
owner
said
short
for
the
samewhat
lofty
name
of
cynthia
doubtless
the
fact
of
these
two
who
were
partners
beating
nearly
every
game
they
played
was
not
without
its
effect
in
promoting
their
most
genial
feelings
a
result
brought
about
not
so
much
by
their
skill
as
by
quimby
perpetually
forgetting
what
was
trumps
confounding
the
right
and
left
bowers
and
disregarding
the
power
of
the
joker
and
in
truth
quimby
mind
was
more
on
his
partner
than
on
the
game
and
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
awake
to
the
fact
that
his
heart
was
fast
filling
with
admiration
and
adoration
of
which
she
was
the
object
and
inevitably
must
soon
overflow
for
nattie
was
really
looking
her
very
best
this
evening
it
was
excitement
and
animation
that
her
face
depended
upon
for
its
beauty
miss
archer
companionship
too
was
doing
much
towards
promoting
the
cheerfulness
that
brought
so
clear
a
light
to
her
eyes
the
light
that
was
now
dazzling
quimby
for
cyn
was
one
of
those
people
who
live
always
in
the
sunshine
and
seem
to
carry
its
own
brightness
around
with
them
while
nattie
on
the
contrary
oftentimes
dwelt
among
the
shadows
and
a
touch
of
their
somberness
hung
over
her
and
showed
itself
upon
her
face
but
none
of
these
lurking
shadows
were
there
and
as
a
consequence
quimby
was
unable
to
keep
his
eyes
off
her
and
sighed
and
made
misdeals
and
became
generally
mixed
his
embarrassment
was
not
lessened
when
cyn
mischievously
informed
him
he
had
certainly
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
miss
fishblate
who
had
called
upon
her
the
day
before
he
dropped
the
pack
of
cards
he
happened
to
have
in
his
hand
at
the
moment
all
over
the
floor
and
then
dived
so
hastily
to
pick
them
up
that
his
head
came
in
violent
contact
with
the
edge
of
the
table
and
for
a
moment
he
was
almost
stunned
but
in
answer
to
cyn
anxious
inquiry
if
he
was
hurt
he
replied
it
nothing
i
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
notwithstanding
which
assertion
his
forehead
developed
such
a
sudden
and
terrific
bump
of
benevolence
that
cyn
insisted
upon
binding
her
handkerchief
over
it
thus
with
his
head
tied
up
and
secretly
lamenting
the
unornamental
figure
he
now
presented
to
the
eyes
of
his
partner
and
charmer
quimby
resumed
the
game
but
what
with
this
cause
of
uneasiness
and
a
latent
fear
that
cyn
jesting
remark
about
celeste
might
be
true
a
fear
he
had
privately
been
conscious
of
previously
although
the
least
conceited
of
mortals
quimby
played
so
badly
and
indeed
would
undoubtedly
have
answered
checkers
had
he
been
asked
suddenly
what
game
he
was
playing
on
account
of
his
meditations
on
a
checkered
existence
that
the
cards
were
soon
abandoned
and
cyn
delighted
them
with
several
songs
and
a
recitation
of
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
while
cyn
was
singing
nattie
happened
to
glance
at
norton
and
suddenly
remembering
a
sentence
in
a
novel
about
some
one
looking
with
his
soul
in
his
eyes
wondered
if
that
was
not
exactly
what
norton
was
doing
now
she
did
not
notice
however
that
it
was
certainly
what
quimby
was
trying
not
to
do
she
wondered
too
if
the
young
artist
was
paying
cyn
some
private
compliments
for
they
seemed
to
be
talking
together
apart
as
all
were
bidding
each
other
if
so
she
could
not
understand
why
cyn
should
look
so
mischievous
over
it
it
was
but
a
momentary
thought
however
forgotten
as
they
all
mutually
agreed
that
the
pleasant
evening
just
passed
should
be
but
the
beginning
of
many
the
circumstance
was
recalled
to
her
mind
however
and
explained
the
next
day
for
on
returning
from
the
office
she
found
under
her
door
a
pen
and
ink
sketch
of
which
she
knew
at
once
cyn
was
the
designer
and
norton
the
executor
it
represented
two
rooms
one
on
each
side
of
a
partition
in
one
was
a
table
containing
the
ordinary
telegraphic
apparatus
before
which
sat
a
young
lady
strangely
resembling
miss
nattie
rogers
with
her
face
beaming
with
smiles
and
her
hand
grasping
the
key
in
the
other
a
young
man
with
a
very
battered
hat
knelt
before
the
sounder
on
his
table
while
behind
him
an
urchin
with
a
message
in
his
hand
stared
unnoticed
and
unheard
far
above
was
cupid
connecting
the
wires
that
ran
from
the
gentleman
to
the
lady
what
nonsense
murmured
nattie
laughing
to
herself
but
she
put
the
picture
away
in
her
writing
desk
as
carefully
as
she
might
some
cherished
memento
chapter
quimby
bursts
forth
in
eloquence
that
young
lady
over
there
acts
very
strangely
she
is
not
crazy
is
she
inquired
a
gentleman
who
stood
leaning
against
the
counter
over
the
way
and
looking
across
at
nattie
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
her
the
previously
mentioned
clerk
to
whom
this
question
was
addressed
answered
i
have
been
observing
her
for
some
weeks
she
sits
half
the
time
as
you
see
her
now
laughing
to
herself
and
gesticulating
sometimes
she
will
lean
back
in
her
chair
and
absolutely
shake
with
laughter
and
she
smiles
at
vacancy
continually
she
seems
all
right
enough
with
the
of
these
vagaries
but
she
is
a
perfect
conundrum
to
me
a
bit
luny
i
think
said
the
gentleman
who
had
asked
the
question
just
then
nattie
who
of
course
was
talking
to
c
and
telling
him
about
that
sketch
with
the
slight
reservation
of
the
cupid
happened
to
look
up
with
her
gaze
seventy
miles
away
but
becoming
aware
of
the
curious
stares
of
the
two
gentlemen
opposite
her
vision
shortened
itself
to
near
objects
and
rightly
surmising
from
their
looks
the
tenor
of
their
thoughts
she
colored
and
straightway
turned
her
back
at
the
same
time
informing
c
of
what
she
termed
their
impertinence
but
c
answered
with
a
laugh
it
can
not
but
look
strange
you
know
to
outsiders
to
see
a
person
making
such
an
ado
apparently
over
nothing
put
yourself
if
you
can
in
the
place
of
the
uninitiated
you
come
along
see
an
operator
quietly
seated
reading
the
newspaper
with
his
feet
elevated
on
a
chair
or
table
the
picture
of
repose
suddenly
up
he
jumps
down
goes
the
paper
he
seizes
a
pencil
hurriedly
writes
a
few
words
frowns
violently
pounds
frantically
on
the
table
stares
savagely
at
nothing
bursts
suddenly
into
a
broad
smile
and
then
quietly
resumes
his
first
position
would
these
seem
like
rather
eccentric
gambols
to
you
if
you
did
know
their
solution
ha
doubtless
answered
nattie
so
i
suppose
i
must
forgive
my
observers
and
be
more
careful
what
i
do
in
future
i
have
no
doubt
i
often
make
myself
ridiculous
to
chance
beholders
when
i
am
talking
with
you
i
wonder
if
that
is
complimentary
to
me
queried
certainly
as
it
is
because
you
make
me
laugh
so
much
nattie
replied
then
i
am
not
such
a
disagreeable
fellow
as
i
might
be
demanded
c
evidently
attempting
to
extort
flattery
but
before
nattie
could
answer
some
one
else
opened
their
key
and
said
oh
yes
you
are
that
was
not
i
nattie
explained
as
quickly
as
possible
some
of
those
unpleasant
people
that
ca
mind
their
own
business
i
was
about
to
say
i
should
not
know
how
to
get
through
the
days
now
if
i
you
to
talk
with
do
you
really
mean
it
questioned
c
delightedly
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
truly
i
was
thinking
only
last
night
how
unbearable
would
have
been
the
solitude
of
my
office
had
i
not
been
blessed
with
your
company
i
was
lonesome
enough
before
i
knew
you
but
i
never
am
now
it
was
a
pity
that
no
telegraphic
instrument
had
yet
been
invented
that
could
carry
the
blush
on
nattie
cheeks
for
his
eyes
to
see
because
it
was
so
very
becoming
she
commenced
a
reply
expressing
her
pleasure
but
was
unable
to
finish
it
on
account
of
that
unknown
and
disagreeable
operator
somewhere
on
the
line
who
kept
breaking
the
circuit
after
every
letter
she
made
nor
was
c
allowed
to
write
anything
either
this
was
a
trick
by
which
they
had
often
been
annoyed
of
late
for
on
the
wire
in
the
telegraphic
world
as
well
as
elsewhere
are
idle
people
who
can
not
endure
to
see
others
enjoying
themselves
if
they
also
have
no
share
thus
unable
to
talk
farther
at
present
with
her
indefatigable
conversationalist
nattie
took
up
a
pencil
and
began
entering
the
business
in
her
books
when
a
shadow
darkened
the
doorway
and
she
looked
up
to
see
quimby
since
the
evening
of
the
card
party
when
he
had
become
so
fully
conscious
of
the
condition
of
things
inside
his
heart
quimby
had
been
in
a
really
pitiable
state
of
unrest
too
bashful
or
too
deficient
in
to
seek
the
society
of
her
who
was
the
cause
of
all
his
uneasiness
as
his
inclinations
directed
and
not
knowing
how
to
make
himself
as
charming
to
her
as
she
was
to
him
he
wandered
past
the
building
containing
her
two
or
three
times
a
day
sometimes
receiving
the
pleasure
of
a
bow
as
he
passed
her
window
but
never
before
being
able
to
raise
the
necessary
courage
to
go
in
and
speak
nattie
who
could
not
but
begin
to
surmise
something
of
the
state
of
his
feelings
but
without
dreaming
of
their
intensity
now
smiled
on
him
and
asked
him
inside
the
office
no
man
or
woman
can
be
quite
indifferent
to
one
whom
they
know
has
set
them
on
a
pedestal
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
i
really
i
i
beg
pardon
i
sure
the
agitated
quimby
trembling
at
his
own
daring
responded
to
her
invitation
i
i
was
passing
quite
accidentally
you
know
thought
i
would
just
step
in
you
know
really
i
i
must
ask
pardon
for
the
liberty
we
are
too
old
acquaintances
now
for
you
to
consider
it
a
liberty
nattie
replied
and
the
words
made
his
perturbed
heart
jump
with
joy
business
being
quite
dull
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
entertained
of
course
archly
you
came
to
entertain
me
poor
quimby
was
decidedly
taken
aback
by
this
question
i
i
yes
certainly
no
that
is
i
mean
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
much
of
an
entertainer
he
stammered
his
hands
flying
to
his
necktie
and
nervously
untying
it
as
he
spoke
certainly
the
wear
and
tear
on
his
neckties
and
watch
chain
while
he
was
in
his
present
condition
of
love
must
have
been
terrific
are
you
queried
nattie
without
gainsaying
his
assertion
no
really
you
know
i
i
always
making
mistakes
but
i
used
to
it
you
know
and
i
am
not
possibly
i
might
be
a
trifle
better
than
nobody
but
that
all
and
having
given
this
honest
and
certainly
not
conceited
opinion
of
himself
he
entered
the
office
sat
down
and
proceeded
to
make
compasses
of
his
legs
have
you
seen
cyn
she
paid
me
a
flying
visit
yesterday
and
talked
a
little
to
but
i
have
seen
her
since
she
went
away
to
sing
out
of
town
let
me
see
i
forget
where
and
she
will
not
return
until
then
uneasily
i
i
beg
pardon
but
you
you
mentioned
the
invisible
do
you
i
beg
pardon
but
do
you
converse
as
much
as
ever
with
him
yes
indeed
nattie
replied
with
an
ardor
that
did
not
produce
exactly
an
enlivening
effect
upon
her
caller
we
talk
together
nearly
all
the
time
what
i
beg
pardon
but
really
what
do
you
find
to
talk
about
so
much
he
inquired
jealously
oh
everything
of
the
books
we
read
and
the
good
things
in
the
magazines
and
papers
and
the
adventures
we
have
telegraphically
in
short
of
all
the
topics
of
the
day
we
agree
very
well
too
except
on
candy
that
i
like
and
he
does
replied
nattie
quimby
suppressed
a
groan
and
hastened
to
assure
her
that
he
himself
possessed
a
great
passion
for
sweetmeats
but
do
you
i
beg
pardon
but
do
you
find
this
sort
of
thing
i
mean
ghostly
you
know
ghostly
echoed
the
astonished
nattie
yes
he
replied
with
a
gesture
of
his
arm
that
produced
an
impression
as
if
that
member
had
leaped
out
of
its
socket
yes
talking
with
the
unseen
you
know
i
i
beg
pardon
but
it
strikes
me
as
ghostly
nattie
stared
what
a
strange
fancy
she
exclaimed
is
very
real
and
of
the
earth
earthy
to
me
i
assure
you
quimby
face
lengthened
some
three
inches
is
he
he
said
ruefully
i
i
beg
pardon
but
you
have
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
have
not
taken
a
bless
my
soul
how
warm
it
is
here
and
he
mopped
his
face
with
a
red
silk
handkerchief
a
color
very
unbecoming
to
his
complexion
warm
repeated
nattie
her
lips
curving
in
an
amused
smile
for
she
had
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
was
nevertheless
slightly
chilly
i
do
perceive
it
i
am
sure
i
i
beg
pardon
but
i
been
walking
you
know
quimby
said
nervously
but
i
i
was
about
to
ask
i
i
beg
pardon
but
you
have
not
not
desperately
really
fallen
in
love
with
him
have
you
nattie
eyes
danced
with
amusement
but
her
color
deepened
slightly
too
as
she
replied
how
could
one
fall
in
love
with
an
invisible
why
that
would
be
even
less
satisfactory
than
an
ideal
quimby
face
brightened
and
he
recovered
himself
sufficiently
to
put
away
the
red
silk
handkerchief
i
do
think
really
i
should
not
think
there
could
be
much
satisfaction
in
it
then
stealing
a
bashful
but
adoring
glance
at
her
he
added
i
i
prefer
a
a
visible
as
being
something
more
substantial
you
know
indeed
said
nattie
demurely
then
thinking
perhaps
he
was
drifting
on
to
grounds
that
had
best
be
avoided
she
changed
the
subject
by
saying
do
you
not
think
cyn
a
very
charming
young
lady
oh
yes
i
i
yes
very
charming
quimby
answered
but
not
so
enthusiastically
as
perhaps
norton
might
have
done
for
heart
was
of
the
kind
and
his
fancy
was
not
fickle
besides
being
now
in
a
measure
launched
upon
the
subject
of
love
so
awful
to
approach
he
was
unwilling
thus
soon
to
leave
a
theme
so
sweet
yet
so
formidable
therefore
crossing
his
legs
and
bracing
up
against
the
he
determined
now
or
never
to
give
her
an
inkling
of
his
feelings
an
intention
so
very
palpable
that
nattie
was
glad
indeed
to
hear
from
the
sounder
b
m
b
m
b
m
excuse
me
she
said
hastily
they
are
calling
me
on
the
wire
and
immediately
answered
and
began
taking
a
message
meanwhile
to
him
had
come
a
reaction
and
he
was
in
a
state
of
total
collapse
before
she
had
finished
receiving
that
message
of
only
ten
words
he
had
drawn
himself
dejectedly
to
his
feet
and
was
looking
for
his
hat
i
i
really
i
must
go
you
know
he
faltered
blushing
as
nattie
glanced
up
at
him
i
i
fear
i
have
intruded
now
but
i
i
he
stopped
short
unable
to
find
an
ending
to
his
sentence
i
always
glad
of
company
nattie
said
but
a
little
distantly
as
she
gave
on
the
wire
i
i
really
you
are
very
kind
you
know
stammered
quimby
i
i
pass
here
on
the
way
to
dinner
you
see
from
the
office
you
know
he
eked
out
his
meagre
income
by
writing
in
a
lawyer
office
where
my
word
i
ought
to
have
been
now
but
it
it
such
a
pleasure
to
see
you
you
know
that
where
can
my
hat
be
all
this
time
he
had
been
looking
around
for
his
hat
and
now
nattie
fished
it
out
of
the
waste
basket
into
which
he
had
unwittingly
dropped
it
taking
it
with
many
apologies
he
bowed
himself
confusedly
and
ungracefully
out
and
went
away
wondering
if
he
would
ever
be
able
to
get
himself
up
to
such
a
pitch
again
and
resolving
if
it
proved
possible
that
it
should
not
occur
next
time
where
there
was
one
of
those
aggravating
sounders
now
i
hope
thought
nattie
as
she
watched
his
retreating
form
that
he
is
not
going
to
make
an
idiot
of
himself
not
only
because
he
is
as
good
a
fellow
as
he
is
a
blundering
one
and
i
would
for
the
world
hurt
his
feelings
but
also
because
it
would
be
dreadfully
uncomfortable
to
have
a
rejected
lover
wandering
around
in
the
same
house
with
one
and
nattie
judging
from
his
late
conduct
that
the
contingency
referred
to
was
likely
to
occur
resolved
to
be
careful
and
not
give
him
any
opportunity
to
express
his
feelings
and
furthermore
to
kindly
and
cautiously
teach
him
the
meaning
of
the
word
friendship
and
particularly
to
define
the
broad
distinction
between
that
and
love
but
circumstances
are
mulish
things
and
not
to
be
governed
at
will
as
nattie
was
soon
to
discover
a
few
evenings
after
she
called
in
to
see
cyn
who
happened
to
be
out
but
she
was
momentarily
expected
to
return
as
simonson
said
so
nattie
concluded
to
wait
and
sat
down
at
the
piano
not
noticing
she
had
left
the
door
partly
open
and
never
dreaming
of
approaching
danger
she
began
to
play
when
suddenly
the
hesitating
voice
of
quimby
broke
in
upon
the
strains
of
the
first
kiss
waltz
i
may
i
come
in
he
asked
i
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
knocked
several
times
you
know
and
you
did
hear
at
all
nattie
would
gladly
have
refused
the
invitation
he
asked
but
could
think
of
no
possible
excuse
for
so
doing
and
was
therefore
compelled
to
say
yes
come
in
i
expect
cyn
every
moment
availing
himself
of
this
permission
quimby
entered
balanced
his
hat
on
the
edge
of
an
album
and
seating
himself
in
a
chair
seized
a
round
on
either
side
as
if
he
was
in
danger
of
blowing
away
and
stared
at
her
without
a
word
it
has
been
a
lovely
day
has
it
nattie
said
at
last
beginning
to
find
the
silence
embarrassing
and
reverting
to
simonson
safe
topic
yes
exactly
so
quimby
answered
strengthening
his
grasp
on
the
chair
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
summon
the
requisite
courage
to
avail
himself
of
this
rare
opportunity
of
pouring
out
his
feelings
nattie
tried
him
again
on
another
safe
topic
cyn
and
i
dined
together
i
i
ca
eat
burst
forth
quimby
in
accents
of
despair
ca
you
said
nattie
devoutly
wishing
cyn
would
come
i
am
very
sorry
i
hope
you
are
not
dyspeptic
no
no
he
answered
his
eyes
almost
starting
from
his
head
between
his
determination
to
wind
himself
up
to
the
point
and
the
tightness
of
his
grasp
on
the
chair
it
it
my
heart
you
know
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
heart
disease
said
nattie
seeing
danger
fast
approaching
and
taking
refuge
in
obtusity
no
i
i
beg
pardon
not
a
not
a
bodily
heart
disease
you
know
but
a
mental
one
and
he
relaxed
his
grasp
on
the
chair
with
one
hand
to
tug
at
his
necktie
as
if
being
hung
and
disliking
the
sensation
that
is
something
i
never
heard
of
nattie
said
dryly
then
thinking
i
drown
him
in
music
she
asked
hastily
do
you
like
the
first
kiss
the
bounce
of
an
india
rubber
ball
is
no
comparison
to
the
agility
with
which
quimby
jumped
from
his
chair
at
this
question
oh
bless
my
soul
would
i
he
gasped
i
will
play
it
to
you
exclaimed
nattie
instantly
aware
of
the
indiscretion
of
her
question
and
she
thundered
as
loud
as
she
could
on
the
piano
while
quimby
with
a
very
red
face
subsided
into
the
chair
again
but
not
long
did
he
remain
subsided
whether
it
was
the
music
that
inspired
im
or
a
desperate
determination
that
nerved
him
he
suddenly
sprang
up
and
with
one
stride
was
beside
her
exclaiming
excitedly
no
that
is
i
beg
pardon
but
please
do
not
play
any
more
just
now
there
is
something
i
must
say
to
you
oh
i
ca
express
myself
it
all
comes
upon
me
with
a
rush
when
i
am
alone
but
now
at
this
supreme
moment
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
a
excuse
me
but
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
remain
now
hastily
interrupted
nattie
feeling
that
something
must
be
done
to
stop
him
and
adopting
the
first
expedient
that
suggested
itself
i
just
happened
to
recollect
i
left
my
gas
burning
in
close
proximity
to
the
lace
curtains
and
i
must
go
immediately
and
attend
to
it
with
these
words
nattie
rushed
away
half
amused
and
half
annoyed
leaving
him
to
stare
after
her
with
a
blank
and
rueful
face
to
ask
himself
how
any
fellow
could
get
on
amid
such
drawbacks
to
decide
that
proposing
was
a
dreadful
strain
on
the
nerves
but
to
resolve
his
next
attempt
should
be
a
success
if
he
had
to
inaugurate
previously
a
series
of
private
rehearsals
for
although
abashed
and
discomfited
by
his
repeated
failures
to
make
his
feelings
understood
he
was
more
in
love
than
ever

where
are
you
n
where
is
the
little
girl
at
b
m
b

b

such
were
the
sounds
that
greeted
nattie
ears
as
she
entered
the
office
the
morning
after
her
adventure
with
the
quimby
and
immediately
she
ceased
to
speculate
on
the
probable
embarrassment
that
must
necessarily
attend
their
next
meeting
and
interrupted
c
solitary
conversation
by
saying
what
is
the
matter
with
you
this
morning
here
i
am
my
dear
i
off
and
wanted
to
say
before
i
went
responded
off
questioned
nattie
with
a
sudden
fall
in
her
mental
temperature
yes
i
am
going
to
a
station
five
miles
below
to
substitute
the
operator
there
is
obliged
to
go
away
and
could
find
any
one
competent
to
do
his
work
and
as
there
was
a
fellow
that
could
do
mine
he
comes
here
and
i
go
there
oh
dear
what
shall
i
do
all
day
said
nattie
sinking
into
a
chair
very
much
aggrieved
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
could
well
avoid
accommodating
him
but
what
will
you
do
when
i
leave
entirely
if
you
ca
get
along
without
me
one
day
happy
i
to
be
so
necessary
to
your
existence
but
there
is
no
prospect
of
your
leaving
at
present
is
there
asked
nattie
forgetting
in
her
alarm
at
such
a
possibility
to
challenge
the
last
of
his
remark
there
is
some
probability
of
it
now
c
responded
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
i
may
come
nearer
to
you
near
enough
even
for
you
to
see
that
twinkle
you
do
mean
you
have
a
prospect
of
an
office
here
in
the
city
questioned
nattie
not
knowing
whether
she
would
be
glad
or
sorry
if
such
were
the
case
not
exactly
replied
i
have
time
to
explain
train
is
coming
so
where
did
you
say
you
were
going
broke
in
nattie
quickly
b
a
five
miles
down
the
line
nearer
you
but
not
on
this
wire
used
to
be
you
know
but
switched
on
wire
number
last
week
c
responded
so
hurriedly
that
nattie
could
hardly
read
it
although
so
accustomed
to
his
style
of
making
his
dots
and
dashes
for
with
the
key
as
with
the
pen
all
operators
have
their
own
peculiar
manner
of
writing
ah
yes
i
remember
responded
nattie
quickly
that
hateful
operator
signing
had
it
that
used
to
be
fighting
for
the
circuit
always
and
breaking
in
when
we
were
talking
i
would
have
gone
for
him
could
well
avoid
it
here
is
train
shall
miss
you
terribly
but
will
be
with
you
again
i
am
lonesome
already
nattie
answered
as
c
made
no
reply
it
was
supposable
he
had
gone
and
probably
had
to
run
for
the
train
thought
nattie
as
she
took
off
her
hat
rather
dejectedly
a
broken
companionship
of
any
kind
must
ever
leave
a
certain
sense
of
loneliness
and
this
was
none
the
less
true
now
on
account
of
the
unique
circumstances
indeed
until
she
had
not
fully
realized
how
necessary
c
had
become
to
her
telegraphic
life
naturally
she
had
woven
a
sort
of
romance
about
him
who
was
a
friend
so
near
and
yet
so
far
perhaps
too
a
certain
yearning
for
tenderness
in
her
lonely
heart
a
feeling
that
every
woman
knows
found
something
very
pleasant
in
being
always
greeted
with
good
morning
my
dear
and
hearing
the
last
thing
at
night
good
night
little
girl
at
b
miss
kling
undoubtedly
would
have
been
shocked
at
being
thus
addressed
even
on
the
wire
by
a
strange
person
a
person
certainly
although
unseen
but
nattie
used
to
the
license
that
distance
gave
whether
wisely
or
unwisely
had
never
thought
it
necessary
to
check
the
familiarity
pondering
over
what
he
had
hinted
about
leaving
permanently
in
the
leisure
usually
devoted
to
chatting
with
him
but
which
that
day
she
hardly
knew
how
to
fill
nattie
wondered
if
should
they
ever
come
face
to
face
they
would
feel
like
the
old
friends
they
were
or
if
the
nearness
would
bring
a
constraint
now
unknown
yet
she
was
fain
to
confess
she
would
like
to
see
him
and
ascertain
the
personal
appearance
of
one
who
occupied
so
much
of
her
thoughts
but
how
strange
it
would
be
if
after
all
their
friendly
talks
and
gay
confidences
he
should
pass
out
of
the
way
that
was
both
their
ways
now
and
they
never
know
anything
more
about
each
other
than
that
one
was
c
and
one
was
n
something
not
impossible
either
or
even
improbable
for
fate
is
a
sort
of
and
a
slight
move
will
switch
two
lives
onto
wires
far
asunder
even
as
the
moving
of
a
peg
or
two
will
alter
everything
on
the
board
that
shows
its
power
so
little
with
such
thoughts
in
her
mind
nattie
was
rather
among
the
shadows
that
day
and
presented
no
laughing
face
to
the
curious
much
to
that
opposite
clerk
relief
who
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
had
once
more
recovered
her
senses
about
an
hour
before
the
time
for
closing
the
office
as
she
was
counting
over
her
cash
and
thinking
how
glad
she
was
that
c
would
be
back
she
became
conscious
of
some
one
waiting
her
attention
outside
and
went
forward
scarcely
looking
at
him
expecting
of
course
a
message
but
instead
the
individual
who
filled
the
air
with
a
suffocating
odor
of
musk
asked
you
are
the
regular
operator
here
i
suppose
with
a
start
nattie
looked
up
expecting
a
complaint
an
occurrence
often
prefaced
by
some
like
question
and
scrutinizing
him
more
particularly
saw
a
short
rather
stout
young
man
possessing
an
air
of
cheap
assurance
hair
that
insisted
on
being
red
notwithstanding
the
bear
grease
that
covered
it
teeth
all
at
variance
with
each
other
and
seeming
to
rejoice
obtrusively
in
the
fact
and
light
blue
eyes
of
a
most
insinuating
expression
trimmed
around
with
red
yes
nattie
replied
as
she
took
this
survey
i
am
you
do
know
me
i
suppose
was
the
next
question
no
nattie
replied
with
a
glance
at
the
large
mock
diamond
pin
and
immense
imitation
amethyst
ring
he
wore
i
certainly
do
not
i
think
you
are
mistaken
about
that
he
rejoined
smiling
at
her
in
a
most
unpleasantly
familiar
manner
surprised
and
offended
nattie
drew
back
haughtily
i
think
rather
you
are
mistaken
she
said
stiffly
may
i
inquire
your
business
with
an
air
of
easy
confidence
and
familiar
remonstrance
he
replied
come
now
do
freeze
a
fellow
why
i
came
to
see
you
that
my
business
and
no
other
he
is
drunk
thought
nattie
indignantly
but
before
she
could
reply
he
added
i
am
an
operator
you
see
oh
said
nattie
comprehensively
but
not
at
all
delightedly
for
operator
or
no
operator
and
notwithstanding
the
sort
of
freemasonry
between
those
of
the
craft
she
preferred
his
room
to
his
company
but
constraining
herself
she
added
as
civilly
as
possible
did
you
wish
to
send
a
message
or
speak
to
any
one
on
the
wire
no
thank
you
he
answered
then
with
an
insinuating
smile
ca
you
guess
who
i
am
i
really
ca
nattie
replied
coldly
and
indifferently
thinking
some
of
the
operators
down
town
i
suppose
and
a
delightful
set
they
are
if
he
is
a
specimen
so
impertinent
of
him
ca
you
laughing
and
displaying
his
obtrusive
teeth
to
their
utmost
advantage
now
just
think
of
some
one
you
have
been
buzzing
lately
and
then
guess
wo
you
n
without
the
least
suspicion
nattie
shook
her
head
impatiently
feeling
very
much
disgusted
and
longing
for
some
interruption
to
occur
but
his
next
words
were
startling
leaning
forward
very
confidentially
he
asked
with
a
smile
of
consciousness
do
you
see
that
twinkle
n
what
ejaculated
nattie
so
forcibly
that
a
passing
countryman
stopped
with
a
peanut
half
cracked
to
stare
and
clutching
at
an
umbrella
hanging
by
her
side
for
support
she
turned
a
face
to
the
questioner
who
looking
as
if
he
expected
her
to
be
enraptured
added
you
know
a
fellow
that
signs
do
you
the
bump
of
must
have
largely
overbalanced
the
perceptive
faculties
of
this
obnoxious
young
man
if
he
could
possibly
mistake
the
expression
on
nattie
face
for
rapture
as
frantically
grasping
the
umbrella
she
gasped
no
no
it
ca
be
you
are
not
not
not
c
ai
i
though
laughed
the
proprietor
of
the
ring
pin
et
cetera
but
said
poor
nattie
clinging
desperately
to
hope
and
the
umbrella
c
said
this
morning
he
was
going
to
b
a
and
that
was
a
trick
to
take
you
by
surprise
he
interrupted
with
great
enjoyment
of
his
own
words
i
knew
i
was
coming
here
all
the
time
but
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
nice
little
surprise
think
i
have
eh
and
he
laughed
again
and
winked
with
almost
vulgar
assurance
nattie
let
go
of
hope
and
the
umbrella
and
collapsed
with
her
romance
into
a
chair
and
she
thought
of
quimby
warning
about
the
soiled
invisible
and
barely
suppressed
a
groan
involuntarily
she
stole
a
glance
at
this
person
and
shuddered
could
she
reconcile
c
her
visionary
interesting
witty
and
gentlemanly
c
of
the
wire
with
this
being
of
greasy
red
hair
cheap
jewelry
and
vulgar
manners
impossible
it
is
the
nightmare
it
can
not
be
she
thought
with
the
despairing
refuge
in
dreams
we
often
take
when
suddenly
overwhelmed
with
terrible
realities
as
she
made
no
reply
to
his
last
observation
her
visitor
glancing
at
her
as
if
slightly
puzzled
by
her
behavior
went
on
i
did
not
think
you
would
be
so
bashful
after
all
our
talks
am
not
a
fact
hardly
necessary
to
mention
we
ought
to
be
pretty
good
friends
by
this
time
say
do
i
look
as
you
expected
i
would
and
as
if
to
give
her
a
better
view
he
pushed
his
hat
back
on
his
head
a
kindness
wholly
unappreciated
as
nattie
had
seen
more
than
sufficient
of
him
already
not
not
exactly
she
stammered
in
a
sort
of
dazed
way
i
believe
you
thought
i
was
one
of
those
slim
fellows
whose
bones
rattle
when
they
walk
did
you
i
am
no
such
a
fellow
you
see
but
you
ai
a
bit
as
i
imagined
may
i
be
a
plug
forever
if
you
are
plug
is
the
common
telegraphic
expression
for
an
incompetent
operartor
nattie
was
too
wretched
too
unable
even
yet
to
realize
that
her
c
and
this
odious
creature
were
one
and
the
same
to
ask
as
he
evidently
expected
natural
curiosity
would
induce
her
to
do
in
what
way
she
so
differed
from
the
person
of
his
imagination
you
go
beyond
all
my
calculations
he
continued
flatteringly
after
waiting
in
vain
for
a
question
from
her
only
you
are
more
bashful
than
i
supposed
you
would
be
after
the
dots
and
dashes
we
have
slung
but
then
it
easier
to
buzz
on
the
wire
than
it
is
to
talk
is
it
for
all
a
fellow
has
to
do
is
to
take
up
a
book
or
a
paper
pick
things
out
to
say
and
go
it
without
exercising
his
own
brains
at
these
words
that
explained
the
previous
incomprehensible
difference
between
the
distant
c
and
present
person
the
realization
of
the
companionship
the
romance
the
friendship
gone
to
wreck
on
this
reef
of
musk
and
came
over
nattie
with
a
rush
and
for
a
moment
so
affected
her
that
she
could
hardly
restrain
her
tears
and
yet
after
all
was
not
c
c
the
c
whom
she
knew
by
his
conversation
only
picked
out
of
books
an
unreal
intangible
being
and
not
this
so
different
person
who
claimed
his
identity
i
think
we
astonished
some
of
them
on
the
wire
with
all
the
stuff
we
had
over
went
on
with
his
monologue
the
knight
of
the
collapsed
romance
who
not
being
troubled
with
fine
sensibilities
had
no
idea
of
the
feelings
under
which
she
was
laboring
yes
i
doubtless
stammered
nattie
and
turned
very
red
as
suddenly
remembering
the
tenor
of
some
of
what
he
so
elegantly
termed
stuff
the
appalling
thought
what
if
he
should
say
my
dear
presented
itself
in
all
its
horrors
and
the
idea
punished
her
for
that
girlish
imprudence
in
allowing
the
familiarity
from
afar
evidently
he
noticed
the
access
of
color
and
attributed
it
to
his
own
fascinations
for
he
smiled
complacently
as
he
said
i
wish
i
had
longer
to
stay
with
you
but
my
train
goes
in
five
minutes
nattie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
too
bad
is
it
but
i
will
come
again
some
time
by
the
way
a
cunning
expression
that
seemed
crossing
over
his
face
do
say
anything
on
the
wire
about
my
being
here
will
you
i
do
want
any
one
to
know
let
them
think
i
was
at
b
a
certainly
not
replied
nattie
with
an
alacrity
born
of
the
knowledge
that
she
should
hold
no
further
communication
of
any
kind
with
him
then
in
order
to
give
a
hint
of
her
intentions
she
added
bracing
herself
up
to
mention
what
was
so
difficult
to
speak
of
to
this
vampire
who
mocked
her
with
her
vanished
now
that
the
the
mystery
is
solved
and
i
and
we
have
met
i
think
there
will
be
much
amusement
in
talking
over
the
wire
somewhat
to
her
surprise
and
not
at
all
flattering
to
her
vanity
he
answered
without
a
remonstrance
no
i
do
know
as
there
will
perhaps
he
does
like
my
looks
any
better
than
i
do
his
was
nattie
natural
and
indignant
thought
at
this
quiet
reception
of
her
hint
and
if
anything
had
been
necessary
which
it
certainly
was
not
to
her
utter
repudiation
of
him
this
would
have
sufficed
for
the
purpose
you
mentioned
this
morning
you
thought
of
leaving
x
do
you
expect
to
go
soon
she
asked
catching
at
the
idea
that
a
few
hours
ago
had
caused
so
much
alarm
with
a
hope
that
he
might
be
about
to
vanish
from
her
world
finally
and
forever
but
even
as
she
spoke
the
difference
of
the
now
and
then
smote
her
like
a
pain
did
i
say
that
he
said
with
a
look
that
she
could
not
understand
as
if
for
some
secret
reason
he
was
so
well
pleased
with
himself
he
could
hardly
avoid
laughing
outright
oh
well
i
was
only
fooling
nattie
face
fell
but
catching
at
the
opportunity
to
convey
the
impression
that
in
her
opinion
they
had
not
been
very
friendly
after
all
she
said
i
suppose
no
one
really
means
what
they
say
on
the
wire
i
am
sure
do
not
but
we
mean
what
we
say
now
he
replied
with
an
insinuating
smile
next
time
i
come
we
will
be
more
sociable
but
we
have
had
a
nice
talk
ai
we
for
a
moment
the
repulsive
person
before
her
overcame
the
remembrance
of
the
lost
c
and
nattie
replied
sarcastically
i
trust
the
talk
has
not
been
too
much
of
an
exercise
for
your
brain
he
looked
at
her
doubtfully
and
then
laughed
you
are
sort
of
a
queer
girl
ai
you
i
wish
though
i
could
stay
and
buzz
you
longer
but
i
have
only
time
to
get
my
train
so
said
nattie
betraying
all
her
relief
at
his
departure
in
the
sudden
animation
of
her
voice
something
so
different
from
her
preceding
manner
that
he
could
but
notice
it
and
he
turned
looked
at
her
as
if
a
suspicion
of
its
true
cause
penetrated
his
mind
at
last
frowned
and
then
with
that
former
look
she
did
not
understand
crossing
his
face
nodded
and
ran
for
the
depot
coming
into
violent
collision
with
a
fat
dutchman
looking
perplexedly
for
a
barber
shop
and
thus
the
red
hair
the
bear
grease
the
sham
jewelry
and
the
obtrusive
fighting
teeth
disappeared
forever
from
nattie
sight
leaving
her
with
a
bewildered
look
on
her
face
as
if
indeed
just
awakened
from
that
imagined
nightmare
she
looked
around
the
office
blankly
everything
was
there
just
as
usual
the
little
key
and
the
sounder
over
which
had
come
all
c
pleasant
talk
c
that
creature
the
odor
of
his
detestable
musk
hovered
about
her
even
now
but
not
yet
could
she
realize
that
her
c
was
no
more
chapter
vii
it
was
a
very
long
face
that
nattie
carried
to
the
hotel
norman
that
night
so
long
that
miss
kling
at
once
saw
that
something
was
amiss
and
while
curiously
wondering
as
to
the
cause
took
a
grim
satisfaction
in
the
fact
for
miss
kling
liked
not
to
see
cheerful
faces
why
should
others
be
happy
when
she
had
not
found
her
other
self
nattie
first
act
on
gaining
her
own
room
was
to
drag
forth
that
pen
and
ink
sketch
and
tear
it
to
atoms
annihilating
the
chubby
cupid
with
especial
care
and
now
she
thought
to
herself
savagely
as
she
burned
up
the
pieces
i
never
will
be
interested
in
people
again
unless
i
know
all
about
them
imagination
is
too
dangerous
a
guide
for
me
having
thus
exterminated
the
illustrated
edition
of
her
romance
nattie
felt
the
necessity
of
unburdening
her
mind
her
sorrow
not
being
too
deep
for
words
and
with
that
object
sought
cyn
a
proceeding
much
disapproved
of
by
miss
kling
who
knowing
well
that
weakness
of
human
nature
that
seeks
a
friendly
bosom
wherein
to
repose
its
sorrows
rightly
surmised
her
lodger
destination
and
design
and
decidedly
objected
to
any
one
knowing
more
than
she
herself
did
nattie
found
her
friend
at
home
but
to
her
vexation
not
alone
with
her
was
quimby
who
had
called
in
the
untold
hope
of
gleaning
tidings
of
the
young
lady
who
had
as
he
said
to
himself
floored
him
his
confusion
at
the
sight
of
her
remembering
as
he
did
the
somewhat
unusual
circumstances
of
their
last
meeting
was
indescribable
indeed
his
knees
actually
knocked
together
nattie
however
whose
latest
experience
had
effaced
the
effect
and
almost
the
remembrance
of
that
former
one
bade
him
without
the
least
trace
of
consciousness
or
embarrassment
a
composure
of
manner
that
astounded
but
at
the
same
time
filled
him
with
admiration
as
he
did
not
take
his
departure
being
in
fact
unable
to
tear
himself
away
nattie
in
her
anxiety
to
tell
cyn
all
that
was
in
her
mind
and
reflecting
that
he
really
was
of
no
consequence
an
argument
not
flattering
to
its
object
but
one
that
he
probably
would
have
been
first
to
indorse
had
he
known
it
and
moreover
that
he
already
knew
the
prologue
disregarded
his
presence
and
said
the
most
incomprehensible
thing
has
happened
cyn
i
can
not
realize
it
even
now
quimby
quaked
in
his
boots
and
grew
hot
all
over
with
the
fear
that
she
was
going
to
relate
their
last
evening
adventure
could
it
be
possible
i
knew
that
something
was
the
matter
the
moment
you
entered
the
room
said
cyn
i
can
not
imagine
why
you
should
look
as
if
you
were
going
into
the
business
ah
cyn
exclaimed
nattie
as
if
the
words
hurt
her
he
called
on
me
quimby
gave
a
bounce
and
then
grew
limp
in
all
his
joints
is
it
possible
personally
questioned
cyn
with
great
interest
and
animation
then
glancing
at
nattie
face
her
tone
changed
as
she
added
he
was
not
what
you
thought
i
understand
poor
nat
quimby
straightened
himself
up
he
fancied
he
saw
a
gleam
of
hope
ahead
far
enough
from
what
i
thought
replied
nattie
with
a
mixture
of
pathos
and
disgust
why
did
he
not
remain
invisible
then
in
a
burst
of
disappointment
cyn
he
is
simply
awful
all
red
hair
and
grease
musk
cheap
jewelry
and
insolent
assurance
quimby
glanced
in
the
opposite
glass
and
his
face
brightened
all
over
he
felt
like
a
new
man
oh
dear
is
it
as
bad
as
that
said
cyn
looking
dismayed
he
was
so
entertaining
on
the
wire
i
can
hardly
believe
it
are
you
quite
sure
it
was
i
could
not
realize
it
myself
but
it
is
a
fact
nevertheless
nattie
answered
sorrowfully
and
then
related
what
she
termed
the
disgusting
details
cyn
listened
vexed
and
sorry
for
she
too
had
become
interested
in
the
invisible
c
but
quimby
found
it
impossible
to
restrain
his
joy
at
this
complete
overthrow
of
one
whom
he
had
ever
considered
a
formidable
rival
it
is
no
use
to
talk
about
romance
in
real
life
said
the
annoyed
cyn
yielding
to
the
conviction
that
the
obnoxious
visitor
really
was
c
as
nattie
concluded
it
is
nice
to
read
about
and
to
enact
on
the
stage
but
it
altogether
too
unreliable
for
our
solid
world
well
dear
consolingly
it
better
to
know
the
truth
than
to
have
gone
on
blindly
talking
to
so
undesirable
an
acquaintance
where
ignorance
is
bliss
is
folly
to
be
wise
quoted
nattie
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
but
yes
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
glad
i
know
the
worst
i
i
beg
pardon
but
i
i
think
i
hinted
it
might
be
as
it
has
proved
you
know
said
quimby
trying
not
to
look
triumphant
and
failing
signally
not
particularly
pleased
at
having
his
superior
discernment
thus
pointed
out
nattie
replied
rather
shortly
it
was
luck
and
chance
anyway
and
it
was
my
luck
to
stumble
on
the
most
disagreeable
specimen
in
the
business
that
is
all
do
you
suppose
he
is
aware
of
the
impression
he
produced
on
you
asked
cyn
no
indeed
nattie
replied
scornfully
is
there
anything
so
blind
as
vulgar
ignorant
i
have
no
doubt
he
thinks
i
was
charmed
then
how
will
you
manage
when
he
wants
to
talk
on
the
wire
again
asked
cyn
i
shall
have
to
make
excuses
until
he
takes
the
hint
oh
dear
said
nattie
with
a
sigh
i
believe
it
is
impossible
to
get
any
comfort
out
of
this
world
oh
no
it
is
said
cyn
in
her
bright
cheery
manner
the
way
to
do
is
not
to
allow
ourselves
to
fret
over
what
we
can
not
help
i
am
almost
as
disappointed
as
you
dear
over
this
total
collapse
of
what
opened
so
interestingly
but
the
curtain
has
fallen
on
the
ignominious
last
act
of
our
little
drama
so
farewell
a
long
farewell
to
our
wired
romance
as
cyn
spoke
the
somewhat
unmusical
voice
of
jo
norton
was
heard
in
the
hall
singing
an
air
from
a
popular
burlesque
followed
by
the
appearance
among
them
of
jo
himself
of
course
the
whole
story
had
to
be
related
for
his
benefit
and
very
little
sympathy
did
nattie
receive
from
him
let
this
teach
you
a
lesson
young
lady
he
said
with
mock
solemnity
namely
attend
to
your
business
and
let
romance
alone
as
you
do
said
cyn
as
i
do
he
echoed
and
consequently
be
happy
as
i
am
i
tell
you
romance
and
sentiment
and
love
and
all
that
bosh
are
at
the
bottom
of
of
all
the
misery
in
the
world
notwithstanding
which
sage
remark
and
the
fact
of
the
curtain
having
fallen
on
the
end
as
cyn
said
for
a
moment
yesterday
was
as
if
it
had
never
been
when
nattie
entered
her
office
the
next
morning
and
was
greeted
with
the
familiar
b
m
b
m
b
m
where
is
my
little
girl
at
b
m
to
say
to
me
and
she
made
an
involuntary
movement
towards
the
key
to
respond
in
the
usual
way
the
remembrance
of
the
actual
state
of
things
checked
her
just
in
time
and
then
with
a
rather
uncertain
and
tremulous
touch
of
the
key
she
answered
good
morning
wait
am
busy
one
untruth
she
thought
to
herself
as
c
became
mute
not
the
only
one
i
shall
have
to
tell
i
fear
before
i
succeed
in
conveying
my
exact
meaning
to
the
understanding
of
the
person
i
will
pick
a
quarrel
if
possible
and
he
persists
in
talking
oh
dear
i
could
have
endured
the
red
hair
even
those
dreadful
teeth
had
it
not
been
for
the
and
general
vulgarity
of
the
creature
well
it
all
over
now
and
she
sighed
from
which
it
may
be
inferred
that
admonitions
had
not
been
of
much
consolation
to
her
we
do
not
take
the
lessons
our
experience
teaches
us
to
heart
immediately
first
their
bitterness
must
be
overcome
to
nattie
great
relief
the
wire
happened
to
be
very
busy
that
morning
but
whenever
it
was
possible
c
called
her
and
called
in
vain
immediately
after
her
return
from
dinner
however
having
just
received
and
signed
for
a
message
c
the
moment
she
closed
her
key
said
where
have
you
been
are
you
not
glad
to
have
me
back
again
it
can
not
be
i
am
so
soon
forgotten
unable
to
avoid
answering
nattie
responded
on
the
wrong
side
of
truth
again
have
been
busy
wait
please
a
customer
here
i
can
not
help
saying
confound
the
luck
c
responded
savagely
to
which
anathema
nattie
turned
up
her
nose
scornfully
and
made
no
reply
the
nervous
dread
of
his
calling
that
was
upon
her
all
day
caused
her
to
make
more
blunders
than
she
had
ever
done
in
all
her
telegraphic
career
she
gave
wrong
change
continually
numbered
her
messages
incorrectly
and
broke
so
much
that
the
operator
who
sent
to
her
had
a
headache
with
usually
very
quick
at
deciphering
the
illegible
scrawls
often
handed
her
for
transmission
she
was
frowned
at
for
her
stupidity
in
making
them
out
and
one
lady
to
whom
a
message
was
sent
through
poor
nattie
office
was
much
exercised
on
receiving
it
to
learn
over
an
unknown
gentleman
signature
that
he
would
be
with
her
at
midnight
he
really
was
her
husband
but
nattie
had
transmitted
the
name
the
writing
looked
most
like
which
was
one
very
remote
from
the
real
one
all
these
mistakes
she
laid
at
c
door
and
grew
more
disgusted
with
him
accordingly
especially
when
she
counted
her
cash
and
found
herself
a
dollar
short
she
managed
however
by
frequent
excuses
to
get
along
without
holding
any
conversation
with
him
until
the
latter
part
of
the
afternoon
when
the
wire
not
being
in
use
and
business
slacking
up
he
called
persistently
savagely
and
entreatingly
all
of
which
phases
can
be
expressed
in
dots
and
dashes
interspersing
the
call
with
such
expressions
as
please
answer
n
where
are
you
n
why
will
you
treat
thus
a
poor
fellow
who
thinks
so
much
of
you
i
should
think
he
might
take
a
hint
must
i
tell
him
in
plain
words
that
a
personal
inspection
leads
me
to
decline
the
honor
of
farther
acquaintance
when
too
he
particularly
requested
me
not
to
mention
his
visit
over
the
wire
thought
nattie
and
then
as
he
continued
to
call
she
arose
impatiently
and
answered
shortly
b
m
you
naughty
little
girl
immediately
responded
c
where
have
you
been
all
day
is
it
thus
you
treat
me
on
my
return
when
i
expected
you
would
be
glad
to
see
me
again
i
have
been
busy
nattie
replied
briefly
with
a
repetition
of
her
platitude
and
cringing
at
the
same
time
over
the
first
of
his
remark
as
she
recalled
his
so
you
have
said
every
time
i
have
called
c
answered
apparently
entirely
unconscious
of
the
possible
reason
what
is
the
cause
you
never
used
to
be
busy
you
know
how
different
he
is
on
the
wire
from
what
he
is
in
reality
thought
nattie
with
a
return
of
her
first
disappointment
and
how
hard
it
is
to
merge
the
two
in
one
but
she
answered
there
is
a
first
time
for
everything
besides
i
have
not
felt
like
talking
not
with
me
queried
no
replied
nattie
briefly
and
to
the
point
c
held
his
key
open
a
moment
i
do
not
understand
it
he
said
at
last
it
is
possible
that
i
have
done
anything
to
offend
you
only
offended
me
with
the
sight
of
you
thought
nattie
but
unwilling
to
be
really
impolite
replied
certainly
not
you
are
not
angry
about
yesterday
are
you
pursued
certainly
not
repeated
nattie
adding
to
herself
a
faint
idea
that
i
did
not
exactly
fall
in
love
with
you
is
creeping
into
your
red
head
is
it
if
i
have
done
anything
i
beg
you
to
tell
me
what
for
i
am
ignorant
of
it
and
i
assure
you
i
am
penitent
and
that
i
forgive
you
continued
c
only
please
do
be
cross
to
me
nattie
saw
her
opportunity
for
picking
a
quarrel
and
seized
it
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
my
being
cross
she
said
i
am
sure
i
was
not
aware
that
i
was
obliged
to
talk
to
any
one
unless
i
felt
like
it
i
am
not
in
the
mood
and
i
will
not
be
forced
you
have
no
right
to
call
me
cross
and
when
i
am
in
the
humor
to
talk
with
you
again
i
will
let
you
know
very
well
c
replied
promptly
undoubtedly
angry
himself
now
i
will
wait
your
pleasure
and
then
was
mute
it
has
not
been
quite
so
gradual
as
i
intended
but
i
think
i
have
effectually
settled
the
matter
and
my
mind
is
relieved
thought
nattie
yet
she
sighed
and
her
satisfaction
was
followed
by
depression
for
with
c
departed
the
pleasantest
part
of
her
office
life
a
fact
she
could
not
disguise
in
the
week
that
followed
when
c
true
to
his
word
waited
saying
nothing
she
missed
continually
the
sympathy
the
gay
talk
the
companionship
that
had
made
the
annoyances
endurable
and
the
days
that
dragged
so
now
seem
short
the
office
business
did
not
fill
half
her
time
and
the
constant
confinement
began
to
be
irksome
to
her
whose
nature
demanded
activity
in
consequence
she
often
grew
impatient
and
answered
unnecessary
questions
of
customers
with
a
shortness
that
gave
considerable
offence
and
had
it
not
been
for
cyn
who
brought
her
sunny
presence
quite
often
into
the
office
heedless
of
the
no
admittance
on
the
door
the
monotony
that
had
now
displaced
the
romantic
side
of
telegraphy
would
have
plunged
nattie
among
the
shadows
almost
constantly
of
course
the
sudden
cessation
of
the
intimacy
between
c
and
n
was
a
theme
of
much
surprise
and
bantering
comments
along
the
line
especially
from
em
but
these
facetious
remarks
gradually
became
fewer
as
the
wonder
subsided
one
day
nearly
two
weeks
after
the
collapse
nattie
was
surprised
to
hear
the
old
familiar
b
m
b
m
b
m
x
wondering
if
he
had
grown
tired
of
waiting
and
was
about
to
attempt
a
renewal
of
their
former
friendship
nattie
rather
impatiently
answered
but
it
proved
he
had
a
message
an
occurrence
quite
infrequent
with
him
this
he
sent
without
unnecessary
words
but
after
she
had
given
and
closed
her
key
he
opened
his
to
say
please
do
you
want
to
make
up
n
i
have
nothing
to
make
up
nattie
replied
was
c
response
as
he
again
subsided
he
snubs
easily
thought
nattie
much
relieved
the
following
saturday
night
however
as
she
was
taking
in
from
the
shelf
outside
the
blanks
ink
and
bad
pens
that
excited
the
ire
of
irascible
customers
preparatory
to
closing
c
once
more
called
with
a
devout
hope
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
annoying
nattie
answered
notwithstanding
the
late
coolness
between
us
which
was
not
my
fault
and
for
which
i
can
not
account
he
began
and
then
some
one
with
a
rush
message
broke
in
what
is
he
coming
at
now
i
wonder
he
commenced
with
a
great
display
of
words
thought
nattie
curiously
and
then
with
a
little
curl
of
her
lip
a
sentence
out
of
some
book
i
suppose
but
as
soon
as
the
wire
was
quiet
she
said
to
please
g
a
account
i
could
not
leave
as
i
am
about
to
do
without
saying
in
remembrance
of
our
former
pleasant
intercourse
concluded
you
mean
you
are
leaving
permanently
queried
nattie
surprised
yes
this
is
my
last
day
here
monday
i
leave
town
and
so
with
much
regret
that
anything
unpleasant
should
have
interrupted
our
acquaintance
although
what
it
was
i
assure
you
i
do
not
know
since
you
deign
me
no
explanation
i
will
say
not
as
i
would
once
but
answered
nattie
forgetting
for
the
moment
everything
but
c
the
old
c
the
c
who
had
enlivened
so
many
hours
and
about
whom
had
dwelt
that
romantic
mystery
believe
me
i
shall
always
remember
the
many
social
talks
we
have
enjoyed
possibly
we
might
enjoy
them
again
if
you
desired
c
said
then
as
if
he
gave
her
a
chance
for
explanation
or
to
express
such
a
wish
but
nattie
recalling
now
the
the
musk
the
cheap
jewelry
and
their
obnoxious
possessor
answered
only
chapter
viii
the
feast
pondering
discontentedly
over
the
perplexities
of
life
a
habit
she
had
allowed
herself
to
indulge
in
quite
frequently
of
late
one
day
not
long
after
the
final
exit
of
the
once
interesting
but
now
obnoxious
c
nattie
suddenly
became
aware
of
a
pair
of
merry
brown
eyes
belonging
to
a
young
gentleman
observing
her
critically
and
with
apparently
no
intention
of
discontinuing
their
scrutiny
at
which
in
her
present
state
of
temper
nattie
turned
very
red
and
very
angry
i
am
not
on
exhibition
she
thought
indignantly
and
rising
majestically
went
towards
him
with
the
curt
inquiry
did
you
wish
to
send
a
message
sir
the
young
gentleman
hesitated
and
appeared
slightly
embarrassed
but
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
her
face
nevertheless
i
merely
wished
to
ask
the
tariff
to
washington
he
replied
at
length
forty
cents
nattie
answered
shortly
thank
you
he
said
but
without
moving
and
after
a
moment
as
if
desirous
of
opening
a
conversation
he
continued
smiling
i
hardly
think
i
will
send
a
message
i
presume
you
will
not
object
to
being
spared
the
trouble
nattie
having
been
quarreling
all
day
with
intangible
somethings
was
rather
glad
than
otherwise
to
find
a
real
object
upon
which
she
could
vent
the
unamiability
resulting
from
her
surplus
discontent
the
young
man
evident
desire
to
talk
more
than
circumstances
warranted
was
displeasing
to
her
and
she
rejoined
very
stiffly
it
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
and
turned
away
with
an
amused
smile
he
looked
at
the
back
thus
presented
to
his
view
opened
his
lips
to
speak
hesitated
and
finally
walked
away
nattie
looking
after
him
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
saw
him
glance
back
as
he
opened
the
door
and
had
a
remorseful
feeling
that
perhaps
she
had
been
crosser
to
him
than
he
really
deserved
for
he
was
certainly
very
but
what
was
done
could
not
be
undone
and
with
no
expectation
of
ever
seeing
him
again
she
dismissed
the
matter
from
her
mind
the
best
perhaps
the
only
really
pleasant
part
of
nattie
life
now
was
her
evenings
passed
almost
invariably
with
cyn
indeed
cyn
seemed
to
be
a
magnet
around
which
all
gathered
quimby
although
of
course
cyn
herself
was
not
his
chief
attraction
celeste
fishblate
who
determinedly
pushed
herself
into
an
intimacy
and
jo
norton
who
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
so
loudly
proclaimed
by
himself
of
his
having
no
sentiment
in
his
soul
would
have
been
suspected
of
being
on
the
road
to
falling
in
love
with
cyn
so
strangely
was
he
attracted
to
her
company
but
this
of
course
was
impossible
for
that
will
not
do
dear
cyn
remarked
when
nattie
related
her
little
adventure
with
the
young
gentleman
do
you
know
you
have
been
in
a
dreadful
state
of
mind
ever
since
intruded
his
personality
nattie
colored
a
little
as
she
replied
discontentedly
oh
it
i
assure
you
the
truth
is
i
am
ambitious
cyn
i
suppose
i
forgot
it
slightly
while
i
was
so
interested
in
but
i
can
not
be
content
with
a
mere
working
on
from
day
to
day
in
the
same
old
routine
and
nothing
more
cyn
looked
at
her
scrutinizingly
as
she
asked
but
in
what
particular
way
are
you
ambitious
to
be
rich
or
what
oh
not
for
money
nattie
answered
with
a
slight
contempt
for
that
necessary
and
convenient
article
i
am
ambitious
for
fame
i
want
to
be
a
writer
but
when
i
think
of
the
obstacles
in
my
way
to
an
opening
even
in
that
direction
i
am
daunted
i
have
attacks
of
energy
it
is
true
but
i
fear
it
is
fitful
it
comes
and
goes
i
understand
cyn
replied
with
more
than
wonted
seriousness
your
ambition
is
great
enough
to
render
you
useless
and
discontented
but
you
need
something
to
stimulate
your
energy
else
it
will
waste
itself
in
idle
dreams
perhaps
love
may
come
to
be
that
motive
power
perhaps
and
a
shade
crossed
her
sunny
face
some
great
disappointment
there
was
a
moment
silence
nattie
pondering
thoughtfully
on
these
words
and
then
cyn
continued
but
in
the
meantime
since
you
can
at
present
accomplish
nothing
why
not
get
all
the
enjoyment
you
can
out
of
life
as
it
goes
so
when
the
opportunity
comes
and
you
seize
it
you
will
not
have
to
look
back
on
years
wasted
in
vain
longings
for
the
then
unattainable
is
my
philosophy
and
i
too
am
ambitious
your
philosophy
is
cheery
at
least
said
nattie
smiling
but
i
am
afraid
it
is
very
hard
for
ambitious
people
to
take
life
easy
and
that
is
not
all
of
my
troubles
she
continued
gayly
i
ca
get
anything
good
to
eat
poor
child
said
cyn
with
mock
seriousness
this
coming
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
what
is
the
cause
of
the
lamentable
fact
oh
i
am
so
tired
of
both
and
restaurants
in
the
former
they
never
have
what
one
likes
and
ah
such
steak
while
in
the
latter
you
have
to
pick
out
all
the
cheap
dishes
or
ruin
yourself
at
a
meal
cyn
laughed
i
assure
you
i
can
appreciate
your
feelings
from
sad
experience
i
myself
am
positively
longing
for
a
nice
sirloin
steak
then
a
sudden
thought
striking
her
i
will
tell
you
what
we
will
do
nat
we
will
have
a
little
feast
a
feast
repeated
nattie
not
exactly
comprehending
yes
i
have
a
little
gas
stove
low
be
it
said
lest
simonson
hear
and
bring
in
a
terrific
bill
for
extra
gas
i
use
it
sometimes
to
cook
my
dinner
when
i
do
not
feel
like
going
out
and
why
should
we
not
have
a
feast
all
to
ourselves
some
day
and
the
sirloin
steak
shall
be
forthcoming
and
what
do
you
say
to
charlotte
russe
in
short
we
will
have
everything
we
can
think
of
and
you
shall
be
assistant
cook
that
would
be
splendid
cried
nattie
delighted
only
it
will
have
to
be
some
sunday
as
that
is
my
only
leisure
day
you
know
all
the
better
for
then
we
will
be
less
liable
to
intrusion
responded
cyn
gayly
so
make
a
memorandum
to
that
effect
for
next
week
we
must
not
let
simonson
know
however
on
account
of
the
gas
stove
i
pay
her
too
much
rent
now
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
a
little
difficulty
about
dishes
the
few
i
have
are
not
exactly
real
sevres
china
or
even
decently
conventional
but
oh
never
mind
the
dishes
interrupted
nattie
anything
will
do
i
have
myself
a
cracked
tumbler
and
a
spoon
that
will
perhaps
be
useful
for
something
agreeing
therefore
to
hold
dishes
in
strict
contempt
the
following
sunday
found
the
two
girls
with
closed
doors
in
the
midst
of
great
preparations
for
a
truly
bohemian
feast
as
cyn
termed
it
nattie
with
her
crimps
tied
down
in
a
blue
handkerchief
and
cyn
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
and
an
old
skirt
of
a
dress
doing
duty
as
apron
let
me
see
said
nattie
merrily
taking
account
of
stock
two
pounds
of
steak
the
first
cut
of
the
sirloin
i
think
you
said
waiting
expectant
of
making
glad
our
hearts
on
the
potatoes
in
plebeian
lowliness
under
the
table
tomatoes
and
two
pies
on
your
trunk
charlotte
russes
delicious
charlotte
russes
where
ah
on
your
in
a
plate
ordinarily
used
as
a
card
receiver
and
sugar
butter
et
cetera
and
et
cetera
lying
around
almost
anywhere
and
the
figs
oranges
and
homely
but
necessary
bread
where
are
they
i
see
on
top
of
son
and
our
dishes
will
not
quarrel
because
thev
are
none
of
them
any
relation
to
each
other
laughed
cyn
as
she
peeled
the
tomatoes
i
fear
goblets
will
have
to
take
upon
themselves
the
duties
of
cups
and
that
cracked
tumbler
of
yours
must
be
used
for
something
i
am
sorry
that
saucepan
is
so
dilapidated
but
it
is
the
best
i
own
and
in
that
saucepan
we
must
both
boil
the
potatoes
and
stew
the
tomatoes
wo
one
cool
while
the
other
is
doing
queried
nattie
hovering
lovingly
over
the
steak
i
think
not
cyn
answered
you
wo
mind
the
coffee
being
boiled
in
a
tin
can
once
the
repository
of
preserved
peaches
will
you
ah
no
replied
nattie
emphatically
and
sawing
at
the
steak
with
a
very
dull
knife
without
a
handle
it
will
be
just
as
good
when
poured
out
i
had
a
once
but
i
melted
the
nose
off
and
forgot
to
buy
another
yesterday
cyn
said
putting
on
the
potatoes
we
will
call
our
contrivance
a
it
sounds
aristocratic
suggested
nattie
as
she
cleared
the
books
from
the
least
shaky
table
and
spread
it
with
three
towels
in
lieu
of
a
but
what
shall
we
do
for
plates
to
put
the
pies
on
take
those
two
wooden
box
covers
in
the
closet
promptly
responded
cyn
that
is
right
and
see
here
is
room
also
for
the
coffee
pardon
me
i
had
almost
said
commonplace
but
the
tomato
what
we
pour
that
in
suddenly
exclaimed
nattie
with
great
concern
cyn
scanned
every
object
in
the
room
with
dismay
the
the
she
insinuated
at
last
determined
not
to
be
daunted
do
you
think
it
rather
large
to
say
nothing
of
its
being
too
suggestive
said
nattie
laughing
cyn
did
not
press
the
point
but
shook
her
head
dubiously
i
have
it
cried
nattie
there
is
a
in
my
room
just
the
thing
interrupted
cyn
ecstatically
i
will
run
and
bring
it
if
you
will
attend
to
the
cooking
look
out
for
miss
kling
said
nattie
warningly
if
she
catches
a
glimpse
of
you
making
off
with
my
she
will
never
rest
until
she
finds
out
everything
rely
on
me
for
secrecy
and
dispatch
said
cyn
going
if
she
sees
me
i
will
mention
nuts
and
raisins
merely
mention
them
you
know
but
miss
kling
for
once
was
napping
perhaps
dreaming
of
him
cyn
called
the
torpedo
celeste
father
and
she
obtained
the
dish
reached
her
own
door
again
without
being
seen
by
any
one
except
the
duchess
and
was
congratulating
herself
on
her
good
luck
when
suddenly
like
an
apparition
quimby
stood
before
her
cyn
started
murmured
something
about
oranges
slipped
the
she
had
also
confiscated
into
her
pocket
and
tried
to
make
the
big
appear
as
small
as
possible
she
might
however
have
spared
herself
any
uneasiness
for
this
always
the
most
unobservant
of
mortals
was
too
much
overburdened
with
some
affair
of
his
own
to
notice
even
a
dish
oh
i
i
beg
pardon
i
i
was
coming
with
a
a
request
to
your
room
he
said
eagerly
i
would
it
be
too
much
to
to
bring
a
friend
he
knows
no
one
here
and
i
am
sure
he
and
you
would
fraternize
at
once
if
i
might
bring
him
you
know
certainly
yes
replied
cyn
too
anxious
to
get
away
to
pay
much
attention
to
his
words
particularly
as
an
odor
of
steak
reached
her
nostrils
thank
you
i
i
never
knew
any
one
who
understood
me
as
well
as
you
he
said
with
a
grateful
bow
and
without
more
words
cyn
left
him
how
long
you
have
been
gone
nattie
remarked
looking
up
her
cheeks
very
red
and
her
nose
embellished
with
a
streak
of
smut
as
cyn
entered
did
you
see
any
one
no
one
except
quimby
who
stopped
me
to
ask
about
bringing
a
friend
to
call
some
evening
cyn
replied
displaying
the
fruit
and
producing
the
mercy
on
us
nattie
said
looking
rather
aghast
it
is
rather
large
is
it
and
what
did
you
for
i
thought
it
might
come
handy
laughed
cyn
we
will
make
a
potato
holder
of
it
for
the
time
what
base
uses
may
we
come
at
last
why
in
a
tone
of
surprise
here
is
the
duchess
and
sure
enough
up
by
the
window
sat
that
sagacious
animal
winking
and
blinking
complacently
and
evidently
determined
to
be
a
third
in
the
feast
she
came
in
unnoticed
under
the
shadow
that
threw
said
nattie
teasingly
cyn
shook
an
oyster
fork
at
her
threateningly
say
another
such
word
and
you
shall
have
no
steak
she
said
tragically
instead
a
dungeon
shall
be
your
doom
we
will
let
the
duchess
remain
as
a
receiver
of
odds
and
ends
i
suppose
her
suspicions
were
excited
by
the
sight
of
these
articles
a
rare
cat
a
learned
cat
now
please
set
the
table
for
our
feast
will
soon
be
prepared
and
cyn
bent
over
the
sizzling
steak
that
emitted
a
most
appetizing
odor
setting
that
table
was
no
such
easy
matter
as
might
appear
for
what
with
the
big
wooden
covers
different
sizes
of
plates
and
other
incongruous
articles
considerable
management
was
necessary
i
shall
have
to
put
the
sugar
on
in
the
bag
nattie
said
incautiously
backing
to
view
the
general
effect
and
so
stumbling
over
the
saucepan
of
potatoes
that
sat
on
the
floor
but
luckily
doing
no
damage
ah
well
eccentricity
is
quite
the
rage
now
you
know
responded
the
philosophical
cyn
and
certainly
a
so
closely
resembling
a
brown
paper
bag
as
not
to
be
distinguishable
from
the
real
thing
is
quite
but
my
dear
nat
where
am
i
to
set
the
steak
if
you
have
that
big
in
the
center
of
the
table
taking
up
all
the
room
i
shall
have
to
put
it
on
the
floor
then
nattie
answered
despairingly
for
i
have
tried
it
on
all
parts
of
the
table
if
you
set
it
on
the
edge
she
added
hastily
seeing
cyn
about
to
do
so
you
will
tip
the
whole
thing
over
then
we
must
have
a
cyn
announced
with
a
plate
of
steak
in
one
hand
and
the
big
in
the
other
put
my
on
a
chair
please
spread
a
towel
over
it
and
there
you
have
it
but
what
a
quantity
of
eatables
we
have
two
pounds
of
steak
ten
big
potatoes
a
dish
of
tomatoes
two
large
pies
two
charlotte
russes
an
urn
of
coffee
a
dozen
oranges
and
a
box
of
figs
good
gracious
think
of
two
people
eating
all
that
exclaimed
nattie
decidedly
dismayed
at
the
prospect
it
is
considerable
cyn
confessed
surveying
the
array
with
a
slightly
daunted
expression
you
see
i
am
not
used
to
buying
for
a
family
and
i
was
afraid
of
getting
too
little
but
brightening
there
is
more
than
one
quart
of
the
tomatoes
and
there
are
of
us
you
know
the
duchess
to
be
sure
i
had
forgotten
her
nattie
said
recovering
her
equanimity
and
glancing
at
the
purring
animal
who
was
looking
on
approvingly
and
evidently
appreciated
the
difference
between
sirloin
and
her
usual
rations
of
round
then
let
the
revels
commence
at
once
cried
cyn
rolling
down
her
sleeves
while
nattie
wiped
the
smut
from
her
face
but
now
another
difficulty
presented
itself
the
chairs
were
all
too
low
to
admit
of
feasting
with
the
anticipated
rapture
this
was
soon
overcome
however
by
piling
a
few
books
in
the
highest
chair
and
appropriating
the
now
for
a
feast
exclaimed
nattie
exultantly
as
they
sat
down
triumphant
and
she
brandished
her
very
big
knife
and
extremely
small
fork
while
cyn
poured
the
coffee
from
the
urn
an
undertaking
attended
with
some
difficulty
and
requiring
caution
and
the
duchess
looked
on
expectantly
and
then
the
goal
almost
reached
upon
their
startled
ears
came
a
dreadful
sound
the
sound
of
a
knock
at
the
door
down
to
the
ground
went
nattie
knife
and
fork
the
narrowly
escaped
a
similar
fate
up
went
the
back
of
the
duchess
and
two
dismayed
bohemians
and
one
impatient
cat
gazed
at
each
other
chapter
ix
unexpected
visitors
it
must
be
miss
kling
overpowered
by
curiosity
murmured
nattie
no
answered
cyn
in
a
stage
whisper
the
knock
is
too
timid
good
gracious
there
it
is
again
stand
in
front
of
the
gas
stove
nat
lest
it
be
simonson
while
i
go
and
invent
some
excuse
for
not
letting
in
whoever
it
is
and
having
given
these
hasty
directions
cyn
opened
the
door
the
smallest
possible
crack
as
she
did
so
and
before
she
could
speak
it
was
pushed
back
violently
almost
knocking
her
over
and
in
burst
quimby
this
however
might
not
have
much
disconcerted
them
as
could
have
been
disposed
of
easily
enough
had
not
at
his
heels
came
a
tall
young
man
a
perfect
stranger
to
both
cyn
and
nattie
you
see
i
keep
my
word
was
the
enigmatical
remark
the
smiling
quimby
made
as
he
entered
then
catching
sight
of
the
festive
board
he
stopped
short
and
stared
with
an
utterly
confounded
face
at
that
at
the
embarrassed
nattie
at
cyn
behind
the
door
and
at
the
saucepan
cover
which
embellished
with
potato
parings
occupied
a
prominent
position
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
his
companion
also
paused
a
surprised
and
amused
smile
lurking
in
his
merry
brown
eyes
as
he
looked
at
nattie
seemingly
regardless
of
anything
else
in
the
room
cyn
was
the
first
to
recover
from
the
general
petrifaction
and
with
the
involuntary
thought
what
an
excellent
stage
situation
came
from
behind
the
door
where
quimby
impetuous
entrance
had
thrust
her
saying
with
as
much
ease
as
she
could
possibly
gather
together
do
be
frightened
at
what
you
see
friend
quimby
we
were
only
extemporizing
a
little
feast
that
is
all
will
you
join
us
but
quimby
only
stared
harder
than
ever
he
was
evidently
struck
speechless
his
companion
thus
placed
in
the
awkward
position
of
an
unintroduced
intruder
withdrew
his
eyes
from
nattie
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
and
turning
to
cyn
said
smiling
i
think
we
owe
you
an
apology
for
our
intrusion
my
friend
quimby
on
whom
i
called
to
day
in
pity
for
my
being
a
stranger
in
the
city
kindly
offered
to
introduce
me
to
some
friends
of
his
he
informed
me
we
were
expected
but
i
fear
we
have
made
a
mistake
at
this
quimby
recovered
his
voice
no
he
cried
in
stentorian
tones
it
was
not
i
have
made
a
mistake
this
time
you
know
cyn
looking
at
her
reproachfully
you
knew
about
it
i
met
you
a
short
time
ago
and
asked
you
and
you
said
we
might
come
you
know
half
amazed
and
half
amused
cyn
shook
her
head
in
denial
at
which
action
quimby
started
and
turned
pale
why
i
i
beg
pardon
but
in
the
hall
you
said
you
know
oh
said
cyn
a
light
breaking
in
upon
her
i
see
but
i
did
not
then
understand
you
i
suppose
rallying
from
her
embarrassment
my
mind
was
so
occupied
with
our
feast
i
was
incapable
of
thinking
of
anything
else
so
please
consider
this
an
apology
for
the
condition
in
which
you
find
us
to
yourself
and
your
friend
whom
you
will
pardon
me
for
reminding
you
you
have
introduced
and
cyn
looking
laughingly
at
the
stranger
who
also
laughed
oh
i
i
beg
pardon
i
am
sure
for
for
all
my
stupidities
i
i
am
always
doing
something
wrong
but
i
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
said
the
disconcerted
quimby
then
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
he
added
clumsily
my
friend
stanwood
cyn
and
miss
miss
rogers
stanwood
gayly
shook
hands
with
cyn
whom
quimby
had
nervously
forgotten
to
honor
with
a
miss
and
then
advanced
to
nattie
who
had
not
stirred
from
her
position
as
screen
for
the
gas
stove
saying
i
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
miss
rogers
and
as
nattie
accepted
his
proffered
hand
in
an
embarrassed
way
not
yet
being
able
to
rise
to
the
situation
and
observed
the
peculiarly
roguish
expression
with
which
he
regarded
her
she
suddenly
became
aware
that
she
had
seen
him
on
some
previous
occasion
but
where
she
was
utterly
at
loss
to
remember
cyn
too
was
struck
by
something
a
little
odd
in
his
manner
to
nattie
and
glanced
at
him
curiously
as
she
said
in
her
most
cordial
tones
and
now
gentlemen
as
we
have
exchanged
apologies
all
around
please
be
seated
quimby
immediately
bounced
up
from
the
on
which
in
his
agitation
he
had
involuntarily
dropped
oh
no
he
exclaimed
hastily
we
we
did
did
not
come
to
dinner
you
know
cyn
smiled
at
quimby
anxiety
to
disclaim
intentions
no
one
thought
of
attributing
to
him
and
turning
to
stanwood
asked
thereby
greatly
scandalizing
nattie
but
supposing
you
were
invited
to
stay
and
share
our
banquet
would
you
were
i
sure
the
invitation
was
heartfelt
i
should
be
sorely
tempted
would
you
quimby
stanwood
replied
easily
poor
quimby
twirled
his
thumbs
confusedly
and
murmured
something
about
leaving
the
ladies
to
enjoy
their
feast
alone
we
have
eatables
enough
for
six
as
nat
was
just
now
intimating
went
on
cyn
who
certainly
had
a
touch
of
true
bohemianism
in
her
composition
as
well
as
jo
norton
but
our
dishes
there
the
rub
and
she
laughingly
held
up
the
while
the
less
adaptable
nattie
thought
apprehensively
of
the
propensity
of
things
to
cool
undaunted
by
the
urn
stanwood
said
with
humorous
wistfulness
but
looking
at
nattie
you
wo
force
us
to
eat
the
dishes
will
you
and
that
steak
smells
so
nice
and
i
have
had
any
dinner
then
away
with
ceremony
and
sit
down
to
the
banquet
said
the
reckless
cyn
regardless
of
the
protest
in
nattie
face
and
truth
to
tell
the
former
young
lady
was
not
at
all
averse
to
this
addition
to
their
number
and
to
the
consternation
of
quimby
and
dismay
of
nattie
and
possibly
a
little
to
the
surprise
of
cyn
stanwood
replied
by
seating
himself
down
in
a
and
saying
gayly
i
feel
positive
that
i
am
about
to
enjoy
myself
as
i
have
not
since
i
was
a
boy
and
stole
eggs
and
cooked
them
on
a
flat
rock
behind
my
uncle
barn
and
had
raw
turnip
for
dessert
sit
down
quimby
upon
this
quimby
with
a
blushing
protest
against
an
intrusion
that
did
not
seem
to
trouble
his
merry
friend
in
the
least
also
sat
down
as
he
did
so
nattie
screamed
but
too
late
on
the
crowning
glory
of
the
feast
on
those
enticing
charlotte
russes
crowded
from
the
table
on
to
a
chair
there
was
quimby
bless
my
soul
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
staring
astounded
at
nattie
scream
but
still
sitting
there
entirely
of
the
ruin
he
had
wrought
cyn
anguish
knew
no
bounds
as
she
saw
what
had
happened
get
up
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
ca
you
get
up
good
gracious
do
you
know
what
you
are
sitting
on
eh
he
queried
rising
obediently
and
looking
at
her
with
a
blank
expression
sitting
on
then
following
her
frantic
gesture
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
chair
behind
him
and
instantly
horror
overspread
his
countenance
bless
my
soul
he
gasped
turning
round
and
round
trying
to
get
a
glimpse
of
his
own
how
did
it
come
there
what
is
it
it
is
charlotte
russe
said
nattie
in
gloomy
despair
russe
echoed
quimby
still
turning
himself
around
like
a
revolving
light
it
it
do
look
much
like
it
you
know
at
this
stanwood
who
had
with
difficulty
suppressed
his
laughter
until
now
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
roar
in
which
he
was
joined
by
cyn
and
then
by
nattie
they
laughed
until
utterly
exhausted
quimby
all
the
time
keeping
up
his
rotatory
motion
with
a
face
whose
lugubriousness
can
not
be
described
i
i
bless
my
soul
i
will
replace
what
i
have
destroyed
i
i
assure
you
i
will
the
unfortunate
quimby
groaned
as
soon
as
he
could
be
heard
i
what
can
i
say
to
express
my
sorrow
i
and
suddenly
ceasing
to
revolve
he
snatched
stanwood
hat
and
started
for
the
door
where
are
you
going
his
friend
questioned
as
gravely
as
he
could
more
charlotte
russes
he
responded
incoherently
and
with
an
agonized
face
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
make
a
suggestion
said
stanwood
with
labored
gravity
i
should
say
some
little
change
in
your
toilet
would
be
quite
appropriate
before
going
on
the
street
and
moreover
that
my
hat
will
not
fit
your
head
at
this
quimby
dropped
the
hat
he
held
as
if
it
had
been
glanced
at
the
chair
whereon
he
had
so
lately
distinguished
himself
took
up
the
tails
of
his
coat
one
in
each
hand
revolved
again
and
then
without
a
word
darted
from
the
room
as
well
as
she
could
from
laughing
cyn
called
after
him
telling
him
not
to
mind
about
getting
the
charlotte
russes
and
to
hurry
back
but
he
made
no
response
poor
quimby
said
stanwood
wiping
the
tears
of
excessive
mirth
from
his
eyes
he
is
such
a
good
fellow
it
is
too
bad
he
always
is
in
hot
water
yes
assented
cyn
removing
the
chair
with
the
remains
of
what
had
been
clinging
to
it
from
sight
nattie
following
it
with
a
somewhat
rueful
glance
shall
we
wait
for
him
i
fear
our
dinner
is
getting
cold
i
do
think
we
had
better
nattie
who
had
long
been
filled
with
a
similar
presentiment
responded
there
is
no
knowing
whether
he
will
return
or
not
and
it
no
use
in
having
everything
spoiled
i
do
not
think
he
will
expect
us
to
wait
stanwood
said
well
then
said
cyn
here
is
a
chair
for
you
stanwood
it
all
right
so
you
need
not
look
before
sitting
luckily
you
are
taller
than
we
and
need
no
books
to
raise
you
now
the
question
is
what
shall
we
give
you
to
eat
from
ah
here
is
the
bread
plate
nat
ca
you
find
another
wooden
cover
no
then
spread
a
piece
of
brown
paper
over
how
fortunate
we
have
an
extra
knife
and
fork
you
mind
their
being
oyster
forks
i
thought
not
nat
and
i
will
use
the
same
spoon
so
you
can
have
a
whole
one
nat
you
and
i
will
have
to
drink
from
that
cracked
tumbler
allow
me
interrupted
stanwood
do
you
know
solemnly
a
cracked
tumbler
is
and
always
was
the
height
of
my
ambition
well
then
we
are
all
right
said
the
jovial
cyn
but
i
fear
she
added
helping
to
steak
if
quimby
comes
before
we
finish
he
will
have
to
go
foraging
for
his
own
dishes
stanwood
was
praising
the
steak
which
he
certainly
ate
as
if
the
admiration
was
genuine
when
a
timid
rap
announced
quimby
reappearance
on
the
scene
in
complete
change
of
raiment
smelling
like
a
field
of
hay
and
figuratively
clothed
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
he
entered
i
i
beg
pardon
he
said
looking
not
at
those
he
addressed
but
humbly
at
the
duchess
who
had
been
walking
the
floor
impatiently
and
indignantly
but
was
now
contentedly
chewing
i
i
assure
you
i
shall
be
delighted
to
go
out
and
get
charlotte
russes
to
replace
those
i
so
wantonly
destroyed
will
you
may
i
be
allowed
not
on
any
account
said
cyn
quickly
besides
the
stores
are
closed
so
they
are
so
they
are
he
exclaimed
putting
his
hand
to
his
head
dejectedly
but
we
can
exist
without
charlotte
russes
i
think
nattie
said
she
had
quite
recovered
her
good
humor
and
was
reconciled
even
to
stanwood
company
indeed
had
secretly
confessed
he
was
really
an
acquisition
such
is
the
power
of
good
beefsteak
some
other
time
we
will
talk
about
it
cyn
said
and
now
we
must
improvise
you
a
cup
plate
knife
fork
and
spoon
i
know
you
must
be
hungry
after
your
exploit
quimby
blushed
i
you
shall
have
fifty
charlotte
russes
tomorrow
he
ejaculated
but
the
articles
you
mention
i
have
in
my
room
and
will
bring
them
you
see
i
sometimes
have
a
little
private
lunch
myself
you
know
and
departing
he
in
a
moment
returned
with
his
dinner
accouterments
which
cyn
commanded
him
to
put
down
at
once
lest
he
demolish
them
let
me
see
she
added
as
he
meekly
deposited
his
burden
on
the
nearest
piece
of
furniture
which
happened
to
be
the
piano
i
can
make
room
for
you
here
next
me
i
think
no
no
he
exclaimed
quickly
if
you
will
be
so
kind
i
i
would
rather
sit
on
that
little
stool
in
the
corner
where
i
can
do
no
damage
you
know
oh
we
must
not
make
a
martyr
of
you
laughed
nattie
as
she
cut
a
pie
with
a
very
dull
knife
which
caused
the
very
unsteady
table
to
shake
so
that
every
one
coffee
slopped
over
no
indeed
there
is
plenty
of
room
here
added
stanwood
steadying
his
cracked
tumbler
but
quimby
shook
his
head
now
really
i
i
shall
feel
much
more
comfortable
if
i
may
if
you
will
allow
me
to
sit
on
the
stool
i
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
my
word
i
i
mean
all
right
but
some
way
i
always
make
a
mess
of
it
cyn
would
have
remonstrated
further
but
stanwood
said
we
had
better
let
him
be
happy
in
his
own
way
i
suppose
he
will
not
be
easy
unless
we
do
and
so
quimby
much
to
his
satisfaction
was
allowed
to
eat
his
share
of
the
feast
on
a
low
stool
in
the
corner
like
a
naughty
visitors
were
destined
to
be
numerous
for
hardly
had
quimby
been
served
when
a
knock
at
the
door
was
followed
by
the
appearance
of
jo
who
into
the
room
and
in
a
mysterious
whisper
said
i
saw
quimby
enter
this
room
bearing
utensils
that
could
only
be
used
for
one
purpose
i
smelt
a
savory
odor
and
here
i
am
and
welcome
too
said
cyn
laughing
come
sit
here
by
me
are
you
and
stanwood
acquainted
oh
yes
replied
jo
perching
himself
on
the
arm
of
a
close
to
cyn
and
appropriating
a
wooden
cover
for
a
plate
as
he
spoke
he
and
quimby
did
me
the
honor
to
call
on
me
but
left
for
metal
more
attractive
whether
the
dinner
or
you
ladies
i
will
not
pretend
to
say
it
was
we
ladies
you
dreadful
creature
said
nattie
their
presence
at
the
dinner
was
quite
accidental
cyn
and
i
started
out
for
a
little
quiet
feast
and
behold
the
result
bohemian
enough
for
even
you
is
it
jo
exactly
what
i
like
replied
jo
and
very
close
indeed
to
cyn
had
jo
managed
to
get
but
then
the
table
was
very
small
but
the
idea
of
you
two
girls
proposing
to
selfishly
enjoy
such
a
feast
all
alone
i
begin
to
think
we
did
make
a
mistake
in
not
making
preparations
for
and
inviting
a
larger
party
acquiesced
cyn
i
wonder
if
miss
rogers
has
overcome
her
anger
towards
offending
me
questioned
stanwood
looking
at
her
roguishly
as
she
helped
him
to
a
second
piece
of
pie
my
anger
towards
you
repeated
nattie
coloring
yes
you
did
not
want
me
to
accept
miss
archer
most
kind
invitation
and
remain
now
confess
did
you
he
asked
laughing
nattie
was
rather
embarrassed
at
this
instance
of
the
young
perceptive
faculties
and
not
exactly
able
to
refute
the
charge
was
somewhat
at
loss
how
to
reply
i
i
do
not
get
acquainted
quite
so
easily
as
cyn
she
stammered
except
on
the
wire
cyn
added
except
on
the
wire
repeated
nattie
with
a
smile
then
meeting
the
curious
glance
of
stanwood
it
suddenly
flashed
upon
her
that
he
was
the
same
young
gentleman
who
had
called
at
the
office
and
inquired
about
the
tariff
to
washington
for
the
sole
object
of
talking
as
she
then
supposed
i
have
seen
you
before
she
exclaimed
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
that
sounds
like
a
novel
what
is
coming
now
ejaculated
jo
with
his
mouth
full
of
pie
stanwood
laughed
very
heartily
at
nattie
exclamation
and
asked
in
reply
have
you
just
discovered
it
i
recognized
you
the
moment
i
entered
the
room
that
is
one
reason
i
was
so
anxious
to
remain
she
snubbed
me
most
outrageously
he
added
to
cyn
in
explanation
and
simply
because
i
tried
to
be
agreeable
to
her
one
day
at
the
office
but
you
had
no
business
to
be
agreeable
said
nattie
also
laughing
and
not
at
all
displeased
of
course
you
had
not
interrupted
jo
i
never
talk
to
strangers
concluded
nattie
except
perhaps
on
the
wire
as
you
said
just
now
he
suggested
you
have
caught
her
now
said
cyn
gayly
as
she
peeled
an
orange
but
you
will
never
do
even
that
again
will
you
nat
one
such
experience
is
quite
enough
for
me
nattie
replied
still
the
next
one
might
not
have
red
hair
or
smell
of
musk
jo
remarked
he
might
be
even
worse
though
interposed
the
penitent
on
the
stool
with
a
strangely
puzzled
look
stanwood
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
observing
which
cyn
said
you
do
understand
of
course
may
i
tell
him
nat
ah
well
yes
nattie
replied
with
an
air
of
vexed
resignation
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
make
up
my
mind
to
be
laughed
at
on
account
of
that
story
forever
and
a
day
i
am
as
much
of
a
victim
as
you
for
i
was
intensely
interested
in
the
unknown
laughed
cyn
then
turning
to
stanwood
she
went
on
it
appears
telegraph
operators
have
a
way
of
talking
together
over
the
wire
knowing
little
about
each
other
and
nothing
at
all
of
their
mutual
personal
appearance
in
this
manner
nat
became
acquainted
with
a
young
man
whom
she
knew
as
and
grew
to
speak
mildly
interested
in
him
now
nat
you
know
you
did
and
so
as
i
remarked
previously
did
i
we
were
introduced
over
the
wire
in
fact
he
seemed
everything
that
was
nice
and
agreeable
and
if
we
did
not
actually
fall
in
love
with
him
you
see
i
am
sharing
your
glory
all
i
can
nat
it
is
a
wonder
if
this
knew
the
impression
he
made
on
two
young
ladies
he
would
certainly
feel
complimented
stanwood
who
was
playing
with
his
knife
and
fork
here
interrupted
fortunately
he
never
really
knew
replied
cyn
while
nattie
looked
somewhat
gloomily
at
her
goblet
of
coffee
in
memory
of
the
romance
that
collapsed
to
continue
this
ower
true
tale
thus
far
all
was
mysterious
enchanting
romantic
but
now
comes
the
dark
sequel
one
day
called
bodily
stanwood
started
and
looked
quickly
up
at
nattie
who
without
observing
his
glance
murmured
contemptuously
odious
creature
at
this
he
turned
with
a
perplexed
look
again
to
cyn
who
proceeded
yes
an
odious
creature
he
proved
to
be
only
think
he
had
red
hair
and
dreadful
teeth
smelt
of
musk
wore
cheap
jewelry
and
in
short
was
decidedly
vulgar
what
exclaimed
stanwood
staring
at
her
as
if
he
thought
she
was
bereft
of
her
senses
what
and
he
dropped
his
knife
and
fork
and
pushed
his
chair
back
violently
to
the
alarm
of
the
duchess
who
was
immediately
behind
cyn
appeared
astonished
at
his
vehemence
but
nattie
too
occupied
with
thoughts
of
this
grievance
to
observe
it
repeated
red
hair
all
bear
grease
and
everything
to
match
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
stanwood
asked
looking
at
her
earnestly
and
speaking
with
great
energy
that
a
person
such
as
you
describe
called
on
you
and
represented
himself
to
be
exactly
nattie
replied
first
telling
me
he
was
going
away
to
substitute
for
a
day
and
then
coming
upon
me
in
all
his
odiousness
the
story
seems
to
interest
you
added
cyn
glancing
at
him
scrutinizingly
stanwood
looked
at
her
at
nattie
mused
a
moment
and
then
burst
into
a
laugh
equal
even
to
the
one
quimby
had
caused
it
does
interest
me
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
very
much
indeed
it
is
really
the
best
joke
considered
from
one
point
i
ever
heard
and
of
course
after
that
day
was
cut
indeed
he
was
nattie
replied
scornfully
the
circuit
was
broken
after
that
jo
added
technically
and
a
romance
was
spoiled
in
the
first
act
added
cyn
rising
from
the
now
vanished
feast
poor
said
stanwood
following
her
example
really
miss
archer
i
have
enjoyed
this
dinner
better
than
any
i
ever
had
and
the
climax
is
the
best
of
all
i
wish
we
might
have
such
a
feast
every
day
said
jo
regretfully
and
except
the
damage
i
do
refer
to
any
done
myself
i
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
i
quite
agree
with
you
about
the
dinner
and
as
for
the
joke
i
i
really
it
was
quite
a
serious
one
to
miss
rogers
at
the
time
i
assure
you
bless
my
soul
you
should
have
seen
how
how
blue
she
was
for
a
week
you
know
said
quimby
nattie
colored
as
stanwood
glanced
at
her
and
knowing
he
could
not
but
notice
the
blush
thought
angrily
how
dreadful
it
is
to
have
such
honest
outspoken
people
as
quimby
about
come
nat
and
help
me
clear
away
the
remains
said
cyn
apparently
glad
enough
was
nattie
to
obey
and
turn
aside
her
burning
face
from
the
sight
of
those
merry
brown
eyes
in
a
very
few
moments
the
banqueting
hall
was
transformed
to
a
parlor
with
only
quimby
sucking
an
orange
on
his
stool
that
he
refused
to
leave
jo
cracking
nuts
and
the
duchess
eating
a
fig
to
tell
of
what
had
been
chapter
x
the
broken
circuit
stanwood
sat
down
at
the
table
where
nattie
was
looking
over
album
and
seemed
to
have
become
very
thoughtful
cyn
meanwhile
busied
herself
in
dressing
an
ugly
gash
the
quimby
had
managed
to
inflict
on
his
hand
suddenly
nattie
was
disturbed
by
stanwood
drumming
with
a
pencil
on
the
marble
top
of
the
table
and
glancing
up
casually
observed
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
with
a
peculiar
expression
and
at
the
same
moment
her
ear
seemed
to
catch
a
familiar
sound
with
a
slight
start
she
listened
more
attentively
to
his
seemingly
idle
drumming
yes
whether
knowingly
or
by
accident
he
certainly
was
making
dots
and
dashes
and
what
is
more
was
making
n
i
will
soon
ascertain
if
he
means
it
or
not
thought
nattie
and
seizing
a
pair
of
scissors
the
only
adaptable
instrument
handy
she
drummed
out
slowly
on
account
of
the
imperfectness
of
her
impromptu
key
pretending
all
the
while
to
be
entirely
absorbed
in
the
album
are
you
an
operator
stanwood
in
his
turn
seemingly
deeply
engaged
in
the
contents
of
a
book
immediately
drummed
in
response
yes
nattie
felt
the
color
come
into
her
face
oh
dear
she
thought
and
cyn
told
him
that
ridiculous
story
every
operator
in
town
will
know
it
now
then
with
the
scissors
she
asked
why
did
you
say
so
where
is
your
office
i
have
none
now
the
pencil
answered
while
cyn
glancing
across
the
room
wondered
to
see
the
two
so
studious
and
unsuspiciously
asked
quimby
if
he
supposed
they
were
practicing
for
a
drum
corps
after
a
few
meaningless
dots
the
pencil
went
on
a
little
girl
at
b
m
was
dreadfully
sold
one
day
the
album
nattie
held
fell
from
her
hands
as
she
stared
petrified
at
her
who
kept
his
eyes
on
his
book
with
the
most
innocent
expression
imaginable
one
that
even
a
chinaman
could
not
have
equaled
where
could
he
have
heard
those
words
once
so
familiar
a
thought
gave
her
the
most
probable
key
you
are
in
the
main
office
of
this
city
and
have
heard
me
talking
with
she
wrote
as
fast
as
the
scissors
would
let
her
no
to
the
first
of
your
surmise
came
from
the
pencil
and
yes
to
the
last
what
office
were
you
in
the
scissors
asked
x
n
responded
the
pencil
what
with
asked
the
scissors
and
if
ever
there
was
a
pair
of
excited
scissors
these
were
the
ones
well
yes
replied
the
pencil
with
provoking
slowness
do
you
the
point
ca
you
that
you
did
not
the
you
thought
you
did
that
day
nattie
breath
came
fast
and
her
hand
trembled
so
she
could
not
hold
the
scissors
with
a
crash
they
dropped
on
the
table
making
one
loud
long
dash
but
the
imperturbable
pencil
went
on
calmly
it
was
all
a
mistake
i
am
disdaining
scissors
and
pencil
nattie
started
up
exclaiming
vehemently
what
do
you
mean
it
ca
be
possible
the
consternation
of
cyn
who
was
just
informing
quimby
that
his
wound
would
do
very
well
now
the
horror
of
the
patient
and
the
surprise
of
jo
norton
at
this
emphatic
and
unaccountable
outburst
from
the
hitherto
so
silent
nattie
was
indescribable
good
gracious
nat
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
cried
cyn
starting
up
and
bringing
the
bottle
of
liniment
she
held
in
violent
contact
with
quimby
head
a
circumstance
that
even
the
victim
did
not
notice
so
absorbed
was
he
in
amazement
at
nattie
exclamation
stanwood
threw
aside
his
book
pencil
and
innocent
countenance
together
and
regardless
of
any
one
but
her
sprang
to
his
feet
advanced
with
both
hands
extended
and
shining
eyes
saying
i
mean
just
what
i
said
it
is
possible
hardly
knowing
what
she
did
utterly
confused
and
bewildered
nattie
placed
her
hand
in
the
two
that
clasped
it
while
cyn
stared
with
distended
eyes
quimby
with
mouth
and
jo
gave
a
long
whistle
cyn
was
first
to
recover
and
began
to
scold
well
she
exclaimed
this
a
pretty
piece
of
business
never
yet
played
on
any
stage
i
should
think
nat
will
you
or
will
somebody
have
the
goodness
to
explain
this
sudden
and
extraordinary
scene
i
i
do
understand
nattie
murmured
faintly
and
looking
and
at
stanwood
who
in
response
smiled
and
said
with
a
firmer
clasp
of
the
hand
he
still
held
i
will
explain
in
a
very
few
moments
how
it
is
possible
that
i
am
the
real
what
screamed
cyn
what
shouted
jo
what
absolutely
yelled
quimby
there
has
been
a
mistake
stanwood
said
now
looking
at
cyn
a
mistake
she
repeated
excitedly
what
you
mean
you
our
of
the
wire
nonsense
you
are
joking
yes
he
is
joking
quimby
reiterated
but
his
teeth
chattered
as
he
spoke
he
is
a
dreadful
fellow
to
joke
clem
is
clem
cried
cyn
and
nattie
in
the
same
breath
do
you
begin
to
believe
me
said
the
gentleman
who
had
caused
all
this
disturbance
and
looking
at
nattic
who
now
becoming
conscious
that
her
hand
was
yet
in
his
withdrew
it
hastily
with
a
deep
blush
i
do
know
what
to
think
cried
cyn
do
explain
something
quick
or
i
shall
burst
a
with
impatience
i
know
i
shall
exclaimed
jo
stanwood
complied
by
saying
the
fact
of
the
case
is
simply
this
that
young
man
so
graphically
described
by
you
girls
that
creature
was
the
operator
i
went
to
substitute
for
that
day
oh
said
nattie
a
light
beginning
to
break
upon
her
but
how
commenced
cyn
i
will
tell
you
how
if
you
will
be
patient
stanwood
interrupted
smiling
his
office
as
you
looking
at
nattie
remember
had
once
been
on
our
wire
he
had
heard
and
i
talking
and
in
fact
had
often
annoyed
us
by
breaking
so
as
he
was
at
the
city
he
took
the
opportunity
to
pass
himself
off
for
me
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
a
joke
perhaps
from
more
malicious
motives
i
recognized
his
description
at
once
from
your
story
and
i
remember
too
his
telling
me
on
his
return
that
he
knew
the
best
joke
of
the
season
a
remark
i
did
not
notice
never
supposing
it
concerned
me
yes
said
nattie
eagerly
and
he
was
very
particular
to
ask
me
not
to
mention
his
call
on
the
wire
i
do
not
suppose
he
imagined
but
we
would
eventually
discover
the
fraud
however
and
so
we
should
had
not
you
looking
rather
reproachfully
at
nattie
in
your
haste
to
drop
so
undesirable
an
acquaintance
avoided
the
least
hint
of
the
true
cause
how
the
dickens
was
i
to
know
what
was
the
matter
i
puzzled
my
brains
enough
over
it
i
assure
you
and
that
impostor
has
been
chuckling
in
his
sleeve
ever
since
i
suppose
said
cyn
indignantly
then
seizing
stanwood
by
the
arms
she
cried
in
a
transport
of
delight
and
it
really
is
true
you
are
our
what
am
i
not
yet
believed
he
questioned
laughing
what
more
shall
i
do
to
convince
you
of
my
identity
you
accepted
our
friend
readily
enough
oh
i
believe
you
cried
nattie
eagerly
then
stopped
and
colored
abashed
at
her
own
so
plainly
shown
delight
but
stanwood
looked
at
her
with
a
gratified
expression
in
his
brown
eyes
and
you
will
not
snub
me
any
more
will
you
he
said
pleadingly
because
i
never
use
bear
grease
or
musk
and
my
hair
is
red
a
bit
i
will
try
and
make
amends
nattie
answered
shyly
adding
i
ought
to
have
known
there
was
some
mistake
i
never
could
reconcile
that
creature
and
and
then
i
may
flatter
myself
that
i
am
an
improvement
asked
stanwood
merrily
at
which
nattie
murmured
something
about
fishing
for
compliments
and
cyn
replied
gayly
yes
because
you
have
curly
hair
you
remember
what
i
said
on
the
wire
nat
could
i
forget
he
replied
gallantly
and
it
is
a
dream
you
are
the
real
replied
cyn
pinching
herself
and
then
seizing
nattie
who
from
the
suddenness
of
it
all
was
yet
in
a
state
there
was
not
a
bit
of
unhappiness
in
it
though
waltzed
ecstatically
around
the
room
crying
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
am
so
glad
at
this
point
quimby
who
during
the
preceding
explanation
had
listened
with
a
face
illustrating
every
variety
of
consternation
and
dismay
attracted
attention
to
himself
by
an
audible
groan
observing
which
he
muttered
something
about
his
wound
the
word
had
a
double
meaning
for
him
then
poor
fellow
and
rising
came
forward
took
his
friend
by
the
shoulder
and
asked
solemnly
now
clem
i
i
beg
pardon
but
is
it
is
this
all
true
and
and
not
one
of
your
jokes
you
know
honestly
are
you
that
that
here
is
a
doubting
thomas
for
you
cried
clem
gayly
but
upon
my
word
of
honor
old
boy
i
truly
and
honestly
am
c
and
i
suppose
you
were
the
visitor
of
no
consequence
who
called
with
miss
archer
that
day
i
was
favored
by
an
introduction
to
her
how
little
i
thought
it
then
how
little
thought
it
groaned
quimby
as
his
hand
fell
dejectedly
from
clem
shoulder
but
i
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
so
saying
he
sank
into
a
chair
that
had
brought
about
such
a
result
as
this
that
had
resurrected
the
dreaded
c
from
the
grave
of
musk
and
bear
grease
was
too
much
but
now
that
all
is
explained
i
am
really
not
sorry
for
the
mistake
clem
said
utterly
unconscious
of
his
friend
state
of
mind
for
had
it
not
been
for
that
i
should
never
have
learned
as
i
have
from
you
two
ladies
what
a
very
interesting
and
agreeable
fellow
i
am
and
he
bowed
profoundly
with
a
twinkle
of
merriment
in
his
eyes
over
the
wire
nattie
added
pointedly
of
course
over
the
wire
he
said
with
another
bow
but
it
shall
be
my
endeavor
to
make
good
my
reputation
minus
the
wire
you
will
have
to
work
very
hard
to
place
stanwood
where
was
in
our
good
graces
said
cyn
archly
then
suppose
we
drop
the
stanwood
and
take
up
clem
who
already
was
somewhat
advanced
he
said
adroitly
ah
clem
sounds
more
natural
does
it
nat
questioned
cyn
laughing
we
knew
clem
and
but
stanwood
is
a
stranger
then
let
us
drop
him
by
all
means
and
now
say
you
are
glad
to
see
your
old
friend
said
clem
gayly
we
are
transported
with
delight
at
beholding
our
clem
so
lately
given
up
as
lost
forever
cyn
replied
with
equal
gayety
and
clem
then
looking
at
nattie
as
if
he
expected
her
to
say
something
also
she
murmured
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
a
remark
that
sounded
cold
beside
that
of
enthusiastic
cyn
but
in
fact
nattie
was
so
confused
so
happy
and
so
strangely
timid
that
she
longed
to
get
away
by
herself
and
think
it
all
over
and
quietly
realize
it
and
besides
in
her
secret
heart
nattie
felt
a
growing
conviction
that
cyn
used
the
plural
pronoun
we
more
than
previous
circumstances
actually
warranted
but
nat
said
cyn
all
unconscious
of
her
friend
jealous
criticism
you
have
not
yet
told
me
how
you
found
him
out
he
telegraphed
to
me
with
a
pencil
on
the
table
and
coolly
informed
me
that
he
was
nattie
explained
and
then
you
jumped
up
and
threw
us
uninitiated
ones
into
a
great
state
of
alarm
said
cyn
and
instead
of
practicing
for
a
drum
corps
as
i
supposed
you
were
talking
secretly
you
sly
creatures
then
turning
to
clem
she
asked
laughing
what
did
you
think
when
nat
dropped
you
so
suddenly
and
completely
what
could
i
think
except
that
it
was
a
caprice
of
hers
he
answered
laughing
at
first
i
thought
she
was
vexed
at
my
having
gone
to
b
a
but
she
denied
that
and
finally
i
believe
i
became
angry
myself
and
concluded
to
let
her
have
her
own
way
nevertheless
i
could
not
resist
calling
to
see
her
when
i
came
to
the
city
and
had
i
met
with
any
encouragement
i
should
probably
have
declared
myself
but
i
was
annihilated
without
ceremony
you
would
not
have
been
perhaps
had
you
been
honest
in
the
first
place
instead
of
asking
unnecessary
questions
about
tariffs
replied
nattie
yes
but
you
were
to
recognize
me
by
intuition
you
know
and
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
chance
responded
clem
quickly
nattie
looked
a
trifle
abashed
but
i
am
quite
sure
i
should
have
suspected
it
was
you
had
i
not
given
you
up
as
hopelessly
she
persisted
why
almost
the
very
first
question
the
creature
asked
was
you
see
that
twinkle
so
he
heard
and
treasured
that
remark
to
some
purpose
he
said
well
i
will
not
dispute
your
intuition
theory
since
your
last
words
assure
me
that
i
do
not
fall
so
far
short
of
your
imaginary
as
did
my
personator
i
imagine
your
expression
of
countenance
on
learning
the
intelligence
was
hardly
flattering
to
his
vanity
nattie
who
had
colored
at
the
first
of
his
remark
replied
contemptuously
his
was
too
great
to
attribute
my
very
uncordial
reception
to
anything
except
as
he
said
bashfulness
i
presume
it
has
afforded
him
great
enjoyment
to
think
how
successfully
he
stepped
into
your
shoes
and
what
a
joke
he
had
played
upon
me
upon
you
mean
corrected
clem
certainly
upon
nattie
replied
with
another
flush
of
color
i
remember
how
indifferent
he
seemed
when
i
hinted
that
now
we
had
met
the
chief
pleasure
of
talking
on
the
wire
was
gone
and
i
believe
he
actually
say
in
so
many
words
that
he
was
but
left
me
to
understand
it
so
and
i
am
indebted
to
him
for
being
such
a
lonesome
miserable
fellow
the
latter
part
of
my
telegraphic
career
said
clem
rather
savagely
nattie
murmured
something
about
the
time
passing
pleasanter
when
there
was
some
one
to
talk
with
and
cyn
asked
curiously
then
you
have
left
the
dot
and
dash
business
have
you
oh
yes
it
was
merely
temporary
with
me
clem
replied
then
seating
himself
on
the
sofa
beside
nattie
and
drawing
a
chair
up
for
cyn
between
himself
and
jo
quimby
being
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
a
prey
to
his
emotions
clem
continued
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
simply
this
my
father
with
a
worthy
of
eugene
wrayburn
in
mutual
friend
determined
to
make
a
doctor
of
me
not
on
account
of
any
qualifications
of
mine
but
for
the
simple
reason
that
a
doctor
is
a
good
thing
to
have
in
a
family
but
i
having
an
intense
dislike
to
the
smell
of
drugs
a
repugnance
to
knowing
anything
more
than
absolutely
necessary
about
the
that
flesh
is
heir
to
and
decided
objections
to
having
the
sleep
of
my
future
life
disturbed
declined
and
at
the
same
time
expressed
a
desire
to
go
into
the
store
with
him
and
become
a
merchant
upon
which
my
most
immediate
ancestor
waxed
wroth
called
me
in
plain
unvarnished
words
a
fool
and
a
pretty
one
i
was
to
set
myself
up
against
his
will
i
who
could
earn
my
salt
without
him
to
back
me
being
of
a
contrary
opinion
myself
i
determined
to
test
my
abilities
in
the
salt
line
i
began
looking
at
nattie
merrily
by
salting
you
then
explaining
to
cyn
jo
and
the
silent
quimby
is
a
term
operators
use
when
one
tries
to
send
faster
than
the
other
can
receive
i
began
my
acquaintance
with
n
by
trying
to
her
to
go
on
with
my
narrative
i
had
learned
to
telegraph
at
college
where
the
boys
had
private
wires
from
room
to
room
and
being
acquainted
with
one
of
the
managers
in
our
city
succeeded
in
obtaining
that
very
undesirable
office
down
there
at
x
n
where
i
remained
until
my
stern
parent
relented
concluded
to
hire
a
doctor
instead
of
making
one
and
offered
me
the
control
of
a
branch
of
the
firm
here
in
your
city
and
here
i
am
and
is
it
strange
how
you
should
have
stumbled
upon
us
feast
and
all
said
cyn
laughing
nattie
was
again
disturbed
by
the
plural
pronoun
and
also
angry
at
herself
for
observing
it
is
it
clem
answered
merrily
what
a
lucky
fellow
i
am
you
see
not
being
at
all
acquainted
in
the
city
i
hunted
up
my
old
college
friend
quimby
who
asked
me
to
call
on
some
lady
friends
of
his
mentioning
no
names
which
of
course
i
was
only
too
glad
to
do
imagine
my
surprise
and
delight
when
i
discovered
who
those
friends
were
but
i
do
know
as
i
should
have
dared
to
reveal
mvself
having
been
so
often
snubbed
with
a
roguish
glance
at
nattie
if
that
story
had
not
been
told
and
the
mystery
solved
imagine
my
dismay
though
at
being
called
an
creature
and
the
surprise
with
which
i
listened
to
my
own
description
so
earnest
were
you
that
i
actually
for
a
moment
thought
my
hair
must
have
turned
red
and
he
ran
his
fingers
through
his
curly
locks
with
a
rueful
face
the
girls
laughed
and
cyn
exclaimed
what
a
pity
it
is
you
tore
up
that
picture
nat
yes
acquiesced
nattie
adding
in
explanation
to
clem
you
remember
that
pen
and
ink
sketch
my
first
act
of
vengeance
was
to
destroy
it
never
mind
jo
will
do
another
will
you
not
asked
clem
turning
to
that
gentleman
who
upon
being
thus
appealed
to
arose
laid
down
the
nutcracker
he
held
and
said
with
the
utmost
solemnity
jo
is
ready
to
draw
anything
jo
is
aghast
and
horrified
at
being
mixed
even
in
the
slightest
degree
with
anything
so
near
approaching
the
romantic
as
the
affair
in
question
what
is
the
use
of
a
fellow
shaving
off
his
hair
i
would
like
to
know
if
such
things
as
these
will
happen
it
is
no
use
fighting
against
nature
laughed
cyn
romance
always
has
been
since
the
world
was
and
always
will
be
i
suppose
your
turn
will
come
jo
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
see
you
a
long
haired
cadaverous
sentimental
artist
yet
never
cried
jo
heroically
but
you
must
confess
that
this
affair
is
taking
undue
advantage
of
a
fellow
a
romance
is
something
entirely
unexpected
and
besides
viewed
telegraphically
there
is
nothing
at
all
romantic
in
the
whole
affair
said
nattie
who
between
her
confusion
at
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
and
her
alarm
lest
something
should
be
said
about
that
chubby
cupid
whom
it
will
be
remembered
she
had
suppressed
in
her
former
description
to
c
was
decidedly
embarrassed
before
jo
could
express
his
satisfaction
at
this
statement
clem
exclaimed
reproachfully
oh
do
not
say
that
not
even
to
spare
our
friend
feelings
can
i
deny
the
romance
of
our
acquaintance
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
cyn
i
really
believe
nat
is
going
over
to
jo
ideas
never
mind
just
wait
until
your
turn
comes
you
unsentimental
jo
madam
cried
jo
when
i
find
myself
in
the
condition
you
describe
i
will
come
and
place
the
disposal
of
myself
in
your
hands
and
he
made
her
a
profound
bow
there
is
many
a
true
word
spoken
in
jest
and
none
of
the
little
party
there
assembled
imagined
how
true
indeed
these
words
were
to
prove
as
cyn
gayly
answered
it
is
a
bargain
jo
and
i
shall
have
no
mercy
on
you
i
can
assure
you
and
we
must
not
forget
that
we
are
indebted
to
quimby
for
the
unraveling
of
all
this
mystery
said
nattie
she
smiled
on
him
where
he
sat
in
his
dismayed
isolation
as
she
spoke
and
although
it
was
the
warmest
smile
she
had
ever
yet
bestowed
upon
him
he
was
rendered
no
happier
by
its
warmth
yes
how
fortunate
it
was
clem
that
you
looked
him
up
said
cyn
nattie
wondered
that
she
could
pronounce
the
familiar
name
so
easily
she
was
quite
sure
she
herself
could
not
was
it
not
exclaimed
clem
delightedly
and
what
is
better
than
all
i
am
coming
here
to
room
with
him
at
this
jo
shook
him
cordially
by
the
hand
cyn
and
nattie
gave
exclamations
of
pleasure
and
quimby
suddenly
started
into
life
i
i
beg
pardon
he
said
hastily
but
i
i
really
i
though
you
said
you
had
rather
be
farther
down
town
you
know
yes
that
was
my
first
inclination
but
as
you
urged
me
so
much
and
as
i
find
so
many
old
friends
here
i
have
concluded
to
accept
your
offer
my
boy
so
consider
the
matter
settled
replied
clem
and
in
his
own
entire
satisfaction
and
unconsciousness
clem
did
not
observe
but
what
quimby
looked
as
happy
as
might
be
expected
at
this
intelligence
wo
we
have
a
jolly
time
sang
cyn
and
clem
nattie
and
jo
but
not
quimby
took
up
the
chorus
and
obtuse
as
he
was
quimby
could
not
but
observe
that
nattie
eyes
were
shining
in
a
way
he
had
never
seen
them
shine
before
that
the
and
going
flush
on
her
cheeks
was
very
becoming
and
that
there
was
an
expression
in
her
face
when
she
looked
at
clem
that
face
had
never
held
for
nor
could
he
fail
to
think
that
the
romantic
commencement
of
the
acquaintance
of
these
two
even
the
episode
of
the
impostor
all
now
enhanced
the
interest
nattie
had
once
felt
for
the
invisible
c
neither
did
he
need
a
prophet
to
tell
him
that
the
two
girls
would
sit
up
half
the
night
talking
confidentially
over
this
unexpected
and
happy
or
even
that
nattie
sleep
would
not
be
quite
as
sound
as
usual
love
it
is
said
is
blind
so
to
some
things
perhaps
it
is
but
never
to
a
rival
and
when
at
last
clem
tore
himself
away
with
the
remark
what
a
fortunate
day
this
has
been
quimby
my
dear
boy
how
can
i
thank
you
i
shall
take
possession
of
my
half
of
your
apartment
at
once
to
be
sure
no
one
shall
again
usurp
my
place
until
then
and
in
parting
perceptibly
held
nattie
hand
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
quimby
followed
him
with
dejected
mien
fully
aware
that
of
all
the
mistakes
he
had
ever
made
he
committed
the
worst
when
he
asked
his
old
chum
to
call
on
some
lady
friends
of
his
chapter
xi
miss
kling
telegraphically
baffled
miss
betsey
kling
was
quite
uneasy
in
her
mind
about
this
time
not
only
because
the
torpedo
refused
to
see
himself
in
the
light
of
that
other
self
and
fled
whenever
he
saw
her
approaching
but
also
because
some
subtle
instinct
told
her
that
under
her
very
nose
was
going
on
something
of
which
the
details
were
unknown
to
her
and
that
listen
as
she
would
could
not
be
ascertained
this
young
man
who
had
so
suddenly
appeared
on
simonson
premises
who
and
what
was
he
from
simonson
she
learned
that
he
was
an
old
friend
of
quimby
that
she
believed
he
was
also
an
old
friend
of
miss
archer
or
miss
rogers
or
of
both
and
that
his
father
was
very
wealthy
humph
said
miss
kling
with
a
suspicious
sniffle
strange
that
he
should
room
with
quimby
if
his
father
is
so
wealthy
why
does
he
not
have
a
room
of
his
own
he
and
quimby
are
such
friends
you
see
simonson
explained
miss
kling
gave
another
sniffle
this
time
of
contempt
at
such
a
reason
being
possible
miss
rogers
is
in
here
about
all
her
time
when
she
is
at
the
office
is
she
not
was
the
next
question
she
is
very
intimate
with
miss
archer
simonson
replied
and
i
suppose
and
that
quimby
are
in
there
with
them
every
evening
are
they
not
pursued
miss
kling
they
called
quite
often
simonson
acknowledged
as
did
norton
and
miss
fishblate
they
seem
to
have
good
times
too
added
kindly
simonson
young
folks
will
be
young
folks
you
know
and
why
not
bless
you
we
never
can
enjoy
ourselves
again
as
we
do
when
young
there
are
too
many
cares
and
worries
when
we
get
to
our
age
miss
kling
rose
stiffly
this
allusion
to
our
age
disgusted
and
offended
her
beyond
pardon
and
she
flew
into
a
spasm
of
sneezing
well
i
for
one
do
not
think
such
conduct
is
proper
she
said
as
soon
as
possible
i
was
brought
up
to
understand
that
young
ladies
should
never
receive
the
visits
of
gentlemen
except
in
the
presence
of
older
people
simonson
only
laughed
a
little
forced
laugh
she
had
when
she
did
not
know
exactly
what
to
say
for
her
own
part
although
not
willing
to
offend
miss
kling
by
saying
so
she
was
glad
to
see
her
lodgers
enjoying
themselves
more
than
glad
to
have
clem
there
as
on
his
arrival
she
had
promptly
tacked
an
extra
dollar
on
the
room
rent
under
the
plea
that
the
wear
and
tear
on
furniture
was
greater
with
two
in
a
room
miss
kling
fearing
perhaps
another
reference
to
our
age
left
her
and
next
attacked
celeste
fishblate
having
long
ago
discovered
nattie
to
be
impregnable
to
the
process
known
as
pumping
a
fact
that
had
augmented
her
dislike
towards
her
lodger
from
celeste
she
learned
that
they
had
nice
times
that
stanwood
was
splendid
and
that
miss
archer
was
just
in
love
with
him
and
he
with
her
humph
thought
miss
kling
with
a
sneeze
it
that
miss
archer
then
is
it
her
next
move
was
to
arrest
poor
quimby
in
the
hall
intending
to
put
him
through
a
series
of
interrogations
regarding
the
antecedents
of
his
friend
and
the
length
of
his
acquaintance
with
miss
archer
but
in
this
she
was
baffled
for
at
the
first
question
quimby
exclaimed
i
i
do
know
do
ask
me
and
fled
miss
kling
much
to
her
dissatisfaction
was
therefore
compelled
to
make
the
little
she
had
gathered
go
as
far
as
it
would
for
the
present
but
she
lived
in
hopes
it
was
perhaps
not
wonderful
that
miss
kling
sitting
lonely
by
her
fireside
and
pining
for
her
other
self
should
feel
envious
because
her
lodger
whom
she
took
ostensibly
for
company
was
enjoying
herself
over
the
way
evening
after
evening
and
telling
her
absolutely
nothing
about
it
but
confining
their
intercourse
to
the
necessary
civilities
undoubtedly
the
few
weeks
that
had
passed
since
clem
appearance
on
the
scene
ought
to
have
been
the
happiest
in
nattie
hitherto
lonely
life
happier
even
than
those
in
which
she
talked
to
the
then
unseen
c
and
speculated
about
him
with
cyn
but
yet
she
sometimes
felt
that
a
certain
something
that
had
been
on
the
wire
was
lacking
now
that
clem
while
realizing
all
her
old
expectations
of
c
was
not
exactly
what
c
had
been
to
her
one
reason
of
this
she
knew
was
her
own
inability
to
conquer
a
sort
of
timidity
she
felt
in
his
presence
a
timidity
from
which
cyn
was
certainly
free
well
aware
that
beside
the
gay
and
brilliant
cyn
she
was
nowhere
nattie
had
a
sensitive
fear
that
he
might
be
disappointed
in
her
but
she
did
not
yet
know
that
the
foundation
of
all
these
uneasy
misgivings
of
hers
was
a
selfish
emotion
the
same
that
had
prompted
that
jealous
pang
at
cyn
we
the
day
he
first
discovered
himself
and
this
was
that
on
the
wire
c
had
been
all
hers
but
in
clem
cyn
seemed
to
have
the
largest
share
twice
he
had
called
on
nattie
at
the
office
but
neither
time
could
stop
and
as
it
happened
on
each
occasion
she
was
in
the
midst
of
a
rush
of
business
hat
left
no
chance
for
conversation
but
one
rainy
saturday
afternoon
when
a
general
dullness
prevailed
and
she
was
fervently
wishing
the
hands
of
the
clock
might
move
on
faster
towards
six
clem
holding
a
very
wet
umbrella
and
with
water
dripping
from
his
curly
locks
presented
himself
if
he
was
not
he
certainly
ought
to
have
been
flattered
by
the
blush
with
which
nattie
involuntarily
welcomed
him
did
you
rain
down
she
hastily
exclaimed
hoping
by
this
trite
commonplace
to
distract
attention
from
the
blush
of
which
she
was
conscious
it
appears
like
it
does
it
he
answered
merrily
giving
himself
a
little
shake
and
placing
his
wet
umbrella
and
hat
in
a
corner
it
was
so
dull
at
the
store
i
thought
i
would
run
around
to
the
scene
of
former
exploits
do
you
not
sometimes
wish
i
was
back
at
x
n
to
keep
you
company
such
days
as
these
without
thinking
twice
before
she
spoke
once
nattie
answered
candidly
as
she
placed
a
chair
for
her
visitor
yes
i
believe
i
do
often
i
do
not
know
whether
to
take
that
as
a
compliment
or
otherwise
clem
said
looking
at
her
as
if
half
vexed
nattie
glanced
up
inquiringly
it
certainly
is
a
compliment
to
my
abilities
for
making
myself
agreeable
at
a
but
said
clem
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
a
poor
fellow
does
not
like
to
feel
as
if
the
farther
away
he
is
the
better
he
is
liked
oh
i
did
not
mean
it
that
way
at
all
exclaimed
nattie
in
hasty
explanation
only
you
know
i
had
more
of
your
company
on
the
wire
clem
looked
pleased
if
that
is
the
trouble
he
began
but
nattie
interrupted
her
face
very
red
i
did
not
mean
that
either
i
meant
it
was
in
such
a
different
way
you
know
and
i
i
could
talk
more
easily
and
i
do
not
believe
i
know
what
i
do
mean
stopping
short
in
embarrassment
clem
looked
at
her
and
smiled
let
us
see
if
it
is
any
easier
talking
on
the
wire
he
said
and
taking
the
key
he
wrote
good
p
m
will
you
please
tell
me
truly
and
relieve
my
mind
if
you
like
me
as
well
as
you
thought
you
would
taking
the
key
he
relinquished
and
without
looking
at
him
she
replied
yes
and
suppose
i
ask
you
the
same
question
what
would
you
say
politeness
aside
i
should
answer
wrote
clem
his
eyes
on
the
sounder
that
i
have
found
the
very
little
girl
expected
and
then
their
eyes
met
and
nattie
hastily
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
for
no
ostensible
purpose
and
clem
said
going
after
her
it
nicer
talking
on
the
wire
is
it
nattie
was
saved
the
necessity
of
replying
by
some
one
down
the
line
who
just
then
inquired
who
was
that
talking
soft
nonsense
just
now
we
do
allow
that
sort
of
thing
here
how
impertinent
exclaimed
nattie
possibly
our
friend
is
somewhere
about
clem
said
then
taking
the
key
responded
to
the
unknown
questioner
do
trouble
yourself
i
shall
not
talk
soft
nonsense
to
you
that
sounds
like
writing
is
it
was
asked
quickly
my
style
must
be
very
peculiar
to
be
so
readily
detected
clem
said
to
nattie
laughingly
then
replied
on
the
wire
if
you
will
sign
i
will
tell
you
em
ah
said
clem
and
immediately
acknowledged
himself
then
followed
a
short
chat
with
em
in
which
she
endeavored
to
make
him
confess
what
office
he
was
then
sending
from
which
he
persistently
refused
to
do
having
bade
em
and
closed
the
key
he
said
to
nattie
verbally
we
ought
to
have
a
private
wire
of
our
own
since
a
wire
is
so
necessary
to
our
happiness
i
see
glancing
around
the
office
that
you
have
an
extra
key
and
sounder
here
yes
nattie
replied
we
had
at
one
time
a
railroad
wire
and
when
it
was
taken
out
the
instruments
were
left
and
have
been
here
ever
since
do
you
suppose
you
could
take
them
home
to
practice
on
say
queried
clem
a
sparkle
in
his
brown
eyes
doubtless
if
i
asked
permission
they
would
allow
me
that
privilege
why
asked
nattie
curiously
i
have
a
brilliant
idea
replied
clem
gayly
but
do
not
be
alarmed
i
am
used
to
it
as
quimby
would
say
it
is
this
i
myself
have
a
key
and
sounder
relics
of
college
days
beauties
too
and
if
you
can
take
home
those
over
there
we
will
have
telegraphic
communication
from
your
room
to
ours
immediately
the
wire
and
battery
i
will
fix
all
right
and
when
cyn
is
out
and
you
ca
come
over
and
at
odd
times
we
will
have
some
of
our
old
chats
but
said
nattie
hesitatingly
although
evidently
delighted
with
the
idea
miss
kling
will
never
hang
miss
kling
interrupted
clem
emphatically
excuse
the
expression
but
she
deserves
it
she
never
need
know
i
will
undertake
to
arrange
everything
and
keep
the
secret
from
her
to
account
for
the
instruments
in
your
room
tell
her
you
are
going
to
practice
at
home
and
have
a
pupil
cyn
i
know
will
be
delighted
to
amuse
herself
by
learning
i
should
like
it
very
much
acknowledged
nattie
but
i
allow
no
buts
clem
interrupted
with
gay
decision
you
get
the
instruments
tell
me
the
first
time
miss
kling
goes
out
to
spend
the
day
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
nattie
needed
little
urging
being
only
too
willing
to
have
some
more
of
those
old
confidential
chats
with
c
which
could
share
and
the
required
promise
was
given
strange
it
is
how
circumstances
alter
cases
coming
to
the
office
that
morning
nattie
had
found
it
disagreeable
and
hard
enough
to
buffet
the
storm
and
had
growled
at
herself
all
the
way
because
she
was
not
smart
enough
to
get
on
in
the
world
even
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
stay
at
home
in
such
weather
for
storms
of
nature
like
storms
of
life
are
hardest
to
a
woman
trammeled
as
she
is
in
the
one
by
long
skirts
that
will
drag
in
the
mud
and
clothes
that
every
gust
of
wind
catches
and
in
the
other
by
prejudices
and
impediments
of
every
kind
that
the
world
in
consideration
doubtless
for
her
weakness
throws
in
her
way
but
now
on
her
way
home
nattie
minded
not
the
wind
and
rather
enjoyed
the
rain
it
may
be
that
this
total
change
in
her
sentiments
was
due
to
the
fact
that
clem
held
the
umbrella
miss
kling
saw
them
come
into
the
hotel
together
wet
and
merry
and
scowled
perhaps
in
former
days
she
had
gone
home
under
an
umbrella
with
somebody
a
possible
other
self
and
so
knew
all
about
the
enjoyability
of
the
experience
but
nattie
did
not
even
notice
her
acrimonious
glance
and
sang
a
gay
song
as
she
changed
her
bedrabbled
dress
cyn
who
was
of
course
immediately
informed
about
the
projected
private
wire
was
delighted
with
the
idea
and
began
studying
the
morse
alphabet
at
once
and
the
best
of
all
is
that
we
are
going
to
get
the
better
of
that
dragon
said
cyn
we
can
nattie
replied
with
emphasis
oh
but
clem
is
sure
of
that
part
cyn
said
with
great
confidence
but
nattie
shook
her
head
dubiously
she
is
so
inquisitive
she
remarked
yes
and
the
most
despicable
character
on
earth
to
me
is
a
person
whose
chief
object
in
life
is
gossip
why
life
is
too
short
to
take
care
of
our
own
affairs
in
i
wish
you
would
leave
her
and
come
and
room
with
me
exclaimed
cyn
indignantly
simonson
would
not
dare
have
me
she
is
afraid
of
miss
kling
you
know
but
i
wish
i
might
for
i
am
tired
of
being
here
nattie
replied
discontentedly
well
we
will
have
our
wire
at
all
events
and
for
once
something
shall
be
that
miss
kling
will
not
know
said
cyn
exultantly
unconsciously
the
dreaded
individual
favored
them
shortly
after
by
going
to
spend
the
evening
with
friends
after
her
own
heart
very
genteel
but
in
reduced
circumstances
and
as
the
instruments
were
all
ready
and
they
had
only
been
waiting
for
her
absence
clem
went
to
work
he
was
assisted
by
the
willing
jo
who
argued
that
running
a
wire
was
solid
work
and
romantic
and
by
quimby
who
viewed
the
arrangement
as
another
formidable
link
in
the
chain
of
his
rival
and
clamored
wildly
for
a
telephone
because
anybody
could
use
a
telephone
but
that
as
clem
said
was
exactly
what
they
did
not
want
consequently
quimby
as
he
lent
his
aid
felt
himself
a
very
martyr
however
he
was
by
this
time
used
to
it
you
know
as
he
would
have
said
having
viewed
himself
in
that
light
since
his
unwitting
resurrection
of
still
he
sometimes
fancied
he
saw
a
dim
light
shining
ahead
through
the
gloom
a
hope
that
clem
might
be
fascinated
by
cyn
many
were
quimby
argued
so
why
should
not
clem
be
and
certainly
he
talked
with
her
more
than
he
did
with
nattie
in
nattie
room
they
placed
the
instruments
on
a
small
shelf
put
up
for
the
purpose
just
outside
her
closet
and
run
the
wire
through
the
closet
into
the
hall
outside
and
thence
along
so
close
to
the
wall
that
it
was
not
noticeable
except
to
those
who
knew
and
then
into
simonson
apartments
here
no
concealment
was
necessary
as
simonson
had
been
informed
of
the
plan
and
although
trembling
lest
the
vials
of
miss
kling
wrath
would
be
poured
on
her
head
should
that
lady
discover
the
arrangement
had
no
objections
to
offer
if
they
were
positive
the
electricity
on
the
wire
would
not
wear
out
the
carpet
or
injure
the
table
which
was
the
terminus
in
quimby
and
clem
room
having
satisfied
her
on
this
point
they
deemed
it
expedient
not
to
show
her
the
battery
in
their
closet
fearing
alarm
lest
it
might
eat
through
the
room
and
overpower
her
and
now
said
clem
gayly
when
all
was
finished
and
fortunately
without
attracting
attention
not
even
celeste
being
in
the
secret
now
quimby
we
can
dispense
with
that
alarm
clock
we
were
intending
to
buy
i
i
beg
pardon
but
i
i
do
quite
catch
your
meaning
the
martyr
replied
in
evident
surprise
why
nat
is
to
be
our
alarm
clock
explained
clem
laughing
she
is
from
necessity
an
early
riser
and
i
shall
depend
on
her
to
call
on
our
wire
at
precisely
six
thirty
every
morning
and
continue
calling
until
i
answer
i
certainly
will
nattie
replied
but
i
will
venture
to
predict
that
both
you
and
quimby
will
privately
call
me
all
sorts
of
names
for
doing
it
it
makes
people
so
very
cross
to
be
aroused
from
a
morning
nap
you
know
it
does
make
cross
i
i
assure
you
it
it
will
be
a
pleasure
quickly
exclaimed
quimby
who
was
delighted
with
this
idea
of
the
alarm
clock
i
will
report
him
if
he
shows
the
least
symptom
of
growling
after
that
assertion
clem
said
to
nattie
somewhat
to
quimby
internal
agitation
for
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
not
really
quite
certain
of
being
in
a
state
of
rapture
at
six
thirty
every
morning
even
when
awoke
by
the
clatter
of
a
sounder
of
which
the
motive
power
was
his
inamorata
and
now
to
christen
our
wire
nattie
who
was
in
high
spirits
said
gayly
and
she
ran
over
to
her
room
and
a
half
hour
chat
with
c
followed
before
she
went
to
bed
for
a
week
after
however
she
lived
as
it
were
on
thorns
and
came
home
every
night
half
expecting
an
explosion
none
came
however
miss
kling
eyes
were
not
as
good
as
they
once
had
been
what
with
their
long
service
watching
for
that
other
self
and
overlooking
her
neighbors
the
hall
was
dark
she
had
no
duplicate
key
to
nattie
room
and
the
small
wire
nestling
close
to
the
wall
was
undiscovered
of
course
she
heard
the
clatter
of
the
sounder
but
this
nattie
explained
on
the
score
of
practice
well
i
am
sure
said
miss
kling
snappishly
i
should
think
you
would
get
enough
at
the
office
without
sitting
up
nights
to
do
it
at
which
nattie
turned
away
to
hide
a
blush
aware
that
c
and
she
sometimes
talked
even
into
the
small
hours
in
their
zeal
doubtless
that
the
new
wire
should
not
rust
out
for
lack
of
using
but
this
telegraphic
arrangement
came
hardest
on
poor
quimby
who
between
his
jealousy
when
the
two
were
communicating
his
inability
to
understand
what
was
being
said
and
the
impossibility
of
sleeping
with
such
a
clatter
in
the
room
lost
his
appetite
and
invoked
anything
but
blessings
on
the
head
of
that
morse
man
who
had
made
such
things
possible
cyn
had
no
intention
of
being
left
out
in
the
cold
and
making
jo
join
her
began
the
study
of
telegraphy
and
the
two
hammered
away
incessantly
it
began
to
be
observable
about
this
time
that
jo
was
very
willing
to
be
led
about
by
the
nose
by
cyn
why
was
not
so
apparent
perhaps
because
there
was
no
romance
in
it
cyn
learned
the
quicker
of
the
two
and
she
was
soon
able
slowly
and
uncertainly
to
call
nattie
ask
her
to
come
over
or
impart
any
little
information
but
was
always
driven
frantic
by
the
attempt
to
make
out
nattie
reply
however
slowly
written
cyn
tried
to
induce
quimby
to
overcome
the
horrors
of
those
little
black
marks
the
alphabet
and
their
sounds
but
he
recoiled
from
the
effort
as
hopeless
however
whenever
they
made
candy
as
they
often
did
he
had
an
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
that
he
did
not
fail
to
improve
on
the
first
occasion
so
uneasy
was
he
about
a
quiet
conversation
clem
and
nattie
were
having
that
he
absently
put
the
mass
of
candy
he
had
been
pulling
into
his
pocket
to
cool
it
cool
but
he
sold
the
coat
afterwards
to
a
boy
at
the
office
next
time
he
forgot
to
grease
his
hands
and
stuck
himself
so
together
that
they
had
the
utmost
difficulty
in
getting
him
apart
but
as
he
said
it
no
matter
i
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
he
capped
the
climax
however
by
accidentally
dropping
a
large
handful
warm
on
top
of
celeste
head
aggravating
the
offense
by
telling
her
to
go
quick
and
soak
her
head
which
although
it
was
what
she
eventually
did
was
too
much
like
a
certain
slang
phrase
much
in
vogue
for
human
nature
to
endure
and
giving
him
an
angry
look
the
only
one
on
record
ever
given
by
her
to
a
man
she
rushed
from
the
room
and
was
seen
no
more
that
evening
after
this
exploit
whenever
molasses
candy
was
on
the
programme
they
made
a
rule
that
quimby
should
sit
in
the
corner
on
the
old
familiar
stool
and
not
move
until
all
was
over
a
rule
to
which
he
submitted
meekly
but
he
was
not
happy
in
truth
all
his
joys
in
these
days
were
mixed
with
alloy
between
the
pointed
monopoly
of
of
late
and
since
she
had
given
up
every
one
else
as
hopeless
had
devoted
herself
entirely
to
him
and
his
secret
jealousy
of
clem
strangely
enough
with
the
exception
of
cyn
no
one
was
aware
of
the
exact
state
of
his
mind
clem
was
as
unconscious
of
it
as
a
child
for
any
peculiarity
in
his
behavior
was
laid
to
his
idiosyncrasies
celeste
suspected
he
was
in
love
but
was
blindly
determined
to
believe
she
was
the
chief
attraction
in
his
eyes
nattie
if
she
thought
about
it
at
all
imagined
he
was
entirely
cured
of
that
former
foolishness
as
she
termed
his
one
attempt
to
put
his
devotion
into
words
and
as
for
jo
being
so
opposed
to
anything
of
a
sentimental
nature
himself
naturally
he
was
unwilling
to
observe
any
indications
of
the
kind
in
another
and
any
glaring
revelations
that
forced
themselves
on
his
notice
he
in
common
with
clem
decided
was
only
quimby
way
oh
dear
no
jo
could
see
nothing
but
facts
it
was
no
sentiment
or
anything
of
the
sort
on
jo
part
of
course
that
made
him
reproduce
the
handsome
brilliant
face
of
cyn
in
so
many
of
his
recent
pictures
oh
no
she
was
a
good
study
that
was
all
nor
that
caused
him
to
seek
her
society
in
preference
to
all
others
to
listen
entranced
when
she
sang
and
to
be
exceedingly
annoyed
a
rare
thing
once
for
good
humored
jo
when
clem
was
given
more
than
his
share
of
her
attention
again
oh
no
cyn
was
a
fellow
bohemian
a
congenial
spirit
that
was
all
neither
in
the
least
sentimental
or
jealous
was
jo
but
for
all
that
and
for
some
unexplained
reason
he
was
not
quite
so
even
in
his
spirits
as
he
was
wont
to
be
sometimes
being
very
happy
and
then
terribly
depressed
did
he
eat
too
much
or
too
little
which
for
if
it
was
not
the
first
commencement
of
a
first
love
and
of
course
it
was
not
it
must
have
been
his
digestion
that
ailed
him
had
miss
betsey
kling
known
of
these
little
uneasy
undercurrents
amidst
the
gayety
that
so
annoyed
her
the
knowledge
would
doubtless
have
given
her
much
satisfaction
besides
possibly
the
inkling
she
could
not
now
obtain
of
what
was
going
on
it
was
a
source
of
great
distress
to
her
that
she
could
not
ascertain
whether
it
was
cyn
or
nattie
with
whom
clem
was
flirting
for
she
was
positive
he
was
trifling
with
the
affections
of
one
or
the
other
and
that
matters
would
end
in
some
kind
of
a
horrible
scandal
but
for
all
her
listening
and
prying
around
she
could
not
seem
to
gain
much
information
except
that
everybody
but
herself
and
perhaps
the
old
gentleman
fishblate
was
having
a
good
time
nor
could
she
get
hold
of
anything
dreadful
which
was
the
greatest
disappointment
of
all
one
night
however
listening
at
her
own
door
as
nattie
bade
cyn
good
night
over
the
way
miss
kling
heard
clem
call
out
from
within
something
that
made
her
very
hair
stand
on
end
it
was
this
please
wake
me
up
earlier
than
usual
morning
will
you
nattie
wake
him
up
indeed
thought
the
outraged
but
happy
miss
kling
as
she
wended
her
way
back
to
her
own
room
pretty
goings
on
and
i
know
i
heard
that
machine
clatter
when
she
was
not
in
one
day
machines
do
not
clatter
without
a
human
agency
somewhere
there
is
something
wrong
here
and
i
will
find
it
out
or
my
name
is
not
betsey
kling
him
up
indeed
chapter
xii
crosses
on
the
line
it
happened
that
not
long
after
cyn
sang
at
a
concert
given
in
one
of
the
principal
halls
of
the
city
of
course
a
party
from
the
hotel
norman
attended
this
party
consisted
not
only
of
all
the
young
people
but
also
included
simonson
cyn
made
a
great
success
and
was
encored
every
time
she
sang
never
had
nattie
so
fully
realized
the
beauty
and
brilliancy
of
her
friend
as
she
did
upon
that
evening
nor
could
she
fail
to
observe
that
clem
too
was
startled
into
a
new
admiration
was
it
because
of
this
that
a
seriousness
quite
foreign
to
the
gay
scene
fell
over
nattie
face
as
for
celeste
she
was
decidedly
envious
and
had
there
been
no
gentlemen
in
the
party
would
have
turned
exceedingly
glum
as
it
was
she
with
some
difficulty
called
up
her
usual
smiles
and
contented
herself
with
whispering
spitefully
to
quimby
how
can
she
appear
before
the
public
so
it
seems
unwomanly
charming
indeed
replied
quimby
without
the
slightest
idea
of
what
she
had
said
as
his
attention
was
concentrated
on
cyn
and
his
brain
incapable
of
entertaining
two
ideas
at
once
but
while
acknowledging
her
attractions
quimby
preserved
his
composure
arguing
to
himself
in
a
common
sense
way
what
is
the
use
of
a
fellow
falling
in
love
with
a
girl
that
every
other
fellow
is
sure
to
fall
in
love
with
too
you
know
simonson
good
soul
quite
swelled
with
pride
in
her
lodger
and
by
her
behavior
created
the
impression
in
the
minds
of
people
sitting
near
that
she
was
the
singer
mother
and
jo
unsentimental
jo
was
entirely
carried
away
with
the
music
of
course
for
music
was
art
and
art
only
in
another
branch
was
his
life
and
work
and
was
not
cyn
a
beautiful
work
of
nature
the
mother
of
all
art
he
will
be
a
very
lucky
man
who
shall
call
our
cyn
his
whispered
clem
to
jo
as
she
came
out
in
answer
to
an
encore
what
ejaculated
jo
so
savagely
that
every
one
turned
to
look
at
him
and
clem
opened
his
eyes
wide
with
surprise
bah
nonsense
and
some
way
or
other
after
this
the
music
sounded
very
dismal
to
jo
and
the
close
air
of
the
room
made
his
head
ache
but
he
had
been
working
very
hard
all
day
and
was
tired
so
this
was
quite
natural
was
clem
presuming
on
his
good
looks
and
thinking
of
making
cyn
he
wondered
if
he
was
certainly
would
not
be
fool
enough
to
jo
stopped
here
in
his
meditations
because
he
would
like
to
have
been
a
little
surer
that
she
would
not
very
strongly
he
felt
just
then
that
things
of
a
doubtful
nature
were
sometimes
very
uncertain
it
was
of
course
no
sentiment
on
his
part
that
caused
these
emotions
he
did
not
wish
cyn
to
throw
herself
away
in
matrimony
that
was
all
and
so
strong
were
his
feelings
on
this
point
that
he
could
not
banish
the
idea
from
his
mind
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
was
noticeably
thoughtful
but
he
was
very
gay
even
unusually
wildly
gay
on
the
way
home
and
kept
simonson
whom
he
escorted
in
such
a
state
of
laughter
that
she
burst
three
buttons
and
was
all
wheezed
up
when
they
reached
the
hotel
why
are
you
so
thoughtful
clem
asked
nattie
as
they
walked
down
their
street
behind
the
rest
in
the
wake
of
jo
gayety
and
celeste
meaningless
giggle
celeste
was
clinging
to
the
arm
of
the
unwilling
but
helpless
quimby
and
chatting
of
the
handsome
tenor
with
a
slight
start
nattie
replied
to
clem
question
i
do
not
know
am
i
yes
you
have
hardly
spoken
a
word
all
the
way
is
anything
the
trouble
asked
clem
and
she
looking
moodily
oh
the
ground
did
not
see
the
anxiety
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
nothing
she
replied
then
startled
him
by
bursting
out
passionately
i
am
tired
of
living
with
no
object
with
nothing
but
a
daily
routine
can
it
be
there
is
no
better
place
in
the
world
for
me
that
my
life
must
be
always
thus
i
be
contented
clem
stopped
short
and
stared
at
her
agitated
face
i
never
knew
you
were
not
happy
nattie
he
said
gently
oh
i
am
not
unhappy
i
am
only
discontented
nattie
replied
you
are
somewhat
contradictory
in
your
statements
said
clem
as
they
went
on
again
for
she
also
had
stopped
is
it
office
troubles
that
annoy
you
poor
little
girl
it
a
monotonous
life
nattie
flushed
at
the
tenderness
in
his
voice
that
is
one
thing
she
replied
a
little
tremblingly
but
i
want
something
to
work
for
as
cyn
has
i
am
ambitious
my
present
position
can
never
content
me
i
am
haunted
all
the
time
by
an
uneasy
consciousness
that
if
i
was
smart
i
should
be
doing
something
to
get
ahead
and
yet
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
remember
you
once
said
something
about
becoming
a
writer
why
not
try
that
suggested
clem
they
had
reached
their
own
landing
at
the
hotel
and
paused
the
remainder
of
the
party
had
disappeared
it
seems
so
hopeless
nattie
answered
dispiritedly
there
is
no
opening
anywhere
but
it
will
never
do
to
wait
for
that
you
know
if
the
world
is
a
closed
oyster
we
must
open
it
is
that
the
way
cyn
did
said
clem
half
surmising
the
realization
of
the
difference
between
cyn
brilliant
success
and
her
own
plodding
along
that
had
caused
her
dejection
and
as
he
spoke
he
took
her
hand
in
his
but
nattie
snatched
it
quickly
away
ah
cyn
she
said
in
sudden
and
uncontrollable
jealousy
of
course
could
never
expect
me
to
compare
with
her
clem
looked
at
her
a
moment
then
some
emotion
flushed
his
face
and
he
would
have
spoken
had
not
miss
kling
disgusted
with
her
inability
to
catch
a
word
from
inside
opened
her
door
saying
sharply
are
you
coming
in
miss
rogers
certainly
nattie
replied
quickly
and
already
ashamed
of
her
jealous
outburst
good
night
clem
but
will
you
not
come
over
and
congratulate
cyn
on
her
success
he
asked
detaining
her
i
heard
a
carriage
just
stop
and
think
she
is
in
it
not
said
nattie
hastily
and
left
him
before
he
could
again
urge
the
request
oh
said
miss
kling
as
nattie
closed
the
door
behind
her
was
that
stanwood
who
came
home
with
you
yes
nattie
answered
briefly
i
should
hardly
have
thought
miss
archer
would
have
allowed
it
remarked
miss
kling
with
a
sneeze
i
do
know
why
she
should
have
forbidden
it
replied
nattie
coldly
yet
looking
somewhat
startled
poor
nattie
nerves
were
decidedly
unstrung
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
are
ignorant
of
what
every
one
else
knows
queried
miss
kling
with
a
malicious
sparkle
in
her
eyes
that
they
are
just
the
same
as
engaged
nattie
turned
a
very
pale
face
towards
her
i
i
think
you
are
mistaken
she
faltered
mistaken
no
indeed
said
miss
kling
positively
i
should
think
your
own
eyes
might
tell
you
that
why
simonson
says
miss
archer
has
thought
of
nobody
but
him
since
he
came
into
the
house
and
that
anybody
can
tell
he
is
in
love
with
her
from
his
actions
and
the
attentions
he
pays
her
and
celeste
told
me
the
same
thing
long
ago
but
i
suppose
miss
archer
is
willing
he
should
come
home
with
she
is
of
course
jealous
of
there
was
a
sneering
emphasis
in
miss
kling
last
words
that
made
them
anything
but
complimentary
as
nattie
felt
but
saying
only
in
a
voice
she
vainly
tried
to
steady
you
may
be
right
she
went
into
her
own
room
and
locked
the
door
behind
her
she
knew
now
knew
what
that
first
romantic
acquaintance
that
dejection
at
the
companionship
lost
in
the
obnoxious
that
joy
when
c
was
restored
to
her
in
clem
that
unsatisfied
desire
to
have
him
back
on
the
wire
all
to
herself
that
suppressed
jealousy
of
cyn
led
to
and
what
it
all
meant
that
she
loved
him
and
he
did
he
as
they
said
love
cyn
alas
who
could
help
loving
bright
beautiful
cyn
to
attract
him
to
herself
was
only
the
romance
of
their
first
acquaintance
and
even
this
cyn
slightly
shared
it
was
not
cyn
fault
nattie
could
not
be
guilty
of
the
petty
meanness
of
disliking
her
friend
because
she
possessed
attractions
superior
to
her
own
but
if
he
loved
cyn
then
indeed
had
the
curtain
fallen
on
the
sad
ending
of
her
romance
the
lights
were
out
and
all
was
darkness
he
loved
cyn
nattie
with
the
first
full
knowledge
of
her
own
feelings
could
hardly
hope
otherwise
remembering
their
intimacy
his
marked
attention
to
her
his
praise
of
her
and
her
winning
beauty
and
talents
yes
it
must
be
that
he
loved
her
oh
why
must
cyn
be
given
everything
and
she
nothing
what
kind
of
fate
was
it
that
marked
out
the
broad
sunny
road
for
one
and
the
somber
uneven
pathway
for
another
must
her
life
be
one
of
lonely
discontent
a
telegraph
office
at
the
beginning
and
a
telegraph
office
at
the
end
was
this
to
be
all
no
thought
nattie
raising
her
head
proudly
and
looking
at
the
red
and
swollen
eyes
that
gazed
at
her
from
the
opposite
glass
life
give
me
something
of
its
best
if
not
of
love
then
of
fame
and
i
will
work
and
persevere
until
i
gain
it
yet
for
all
of
her
resolution
nattie
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
not
so
easy
is
it
to
renounce
love
and
look
forward
to
a
life
barren
of
its
best
and
sweetest
gift
and
after
this
there
was
a
change
in
her
observable
even
to
the
undiscerning
quimby
shadows
had
fallen
over
her
face
lurked
in
her
gray
eyes
and
around
the
corners
of
her
mouth
the
old
restlessness
had
given
place
to
a
settled
gloom
she
was
less
often
seen
among
the
gay
circle
that
gathered
in
cyn
parlor
pleading
every
possible
excuse
for
staying
away
and
when
with
them
to
his
surprise
and
delight
and
to
celeste
dismay
she
devoted
herself
to
quimby
to
jo
to
any
one
rather
than
to
clem
for
most
of
all
had
she
changed
to
him
afraid
of
betraying
her
secret
and
unable
to
control
the
pain
that
overpowered
her
when
in
his
presence
now
she
knew
her
own
heart
she
avoided
him
in
every
practicable
way
and
seldom
even
over
their
wire
talked
with
him
she
was
always
tired
or
busy
when
he
called
her
now
clem
surprised
and
puzzled
by
this
unaccountable
change
at
first
endeavored
to
overcome
her
coolness
but
ended
by
becoming
cool
in
his
turn
and
talked
and
joked
with
cyn
more
than
ever
and
if
a
touch
of
the
shadows
on
nattie
face
sometimes
crept
over
his
own
she
in
her
did
not
observe
it
if
quimby
hopes
burned
brighter
at
this
state
of
affairs
and
he
was
consequently
happier
jo
for
some
reason
unexplained
was
not
in
fact
he
was
decidedly
queer
now
gay
now
horribly
cynical
not
to
say
morose
truly
cupid
viewed
in
the
character
of
a
telegraphist
was
far
from
being
a
success
for
he
had
switched
everybody
off
on
to
the
wrong
wire
cyn
gay
unconscious
cyn
no
more
dreamed
of
clem
being
supposedly
in
love
with
her
than
she
did
that
jo
was
so
filled
with
thoughts
of
her
that
had
he
been
a
different
kind
of
a
man
one
would
have
called
him
desperately
in
love
but
cyn
unconscious
of
all
this
saw
and
with
sorrow
the
coldness
between
nattie
and
clem
for
she
had
quite
set
her
heart
on
the
romance
that
had
commenced
in
dots
and
dashes
culminating
in
orange
blossoms
a
wired
love
but
now
to
her
vexation
she
saw
her
anticipations
liable
to
be
set
at
naught
and
herself
unable
to
obtain
even
a
clew
to
the
trouble
like
the
line
man
who
goes
up
and
down
to
find
why
the
wires
will
not
work
she
could
not
find
the
break
anywhere
and
decided
that
romances
whether
wired
or
taken
in
the
ordinary
way
were
certainly
very
unwieldy
things
to
manage
it
seems
to
me
that
you
do
not
use
that
wire
very
often
now
she
said
one
evening
to
clem
and
nattie
the
latter
of
whom
she
had
forcibly
dragged
forth
from
the
solitude
of
her
room
were
it
not
for
me
it
would
rust
why
i
used
to
hear
your
clatter
into
the
small
hours
but
now
now
we
are
more
sensible
concluded
nattie
leaning
over
the
piano
to
look
at
some
music
one
gets
tired
of
talking
in
dots
and
dashes
after
a
time
poor
nattie
trouble
made
her
bitter
sometimes
yes
one
wants
a
person
they
do
know
to
talk
with
in
order
to
make
it
interesting
added
clem
not
to
be
outdone
good
gracious
thought
cyn
dismayed
at
the
result
of
her
probing
this
is
really
dreadful
then
she
exclaimed
impulsively
i
hope
you
have
not
quarreled
you
two
oh
dear
no
replied
nattie
quickly
what
should
we
quarrel
about
but
clem
after
looking
at
her
a
moment
advanced
and
held
out
his
hand
saying
frankly
i
believe
we
have
been
cross
to
each
other
of
late
although
how
it
happened
i
do
not
know
so
let
us
make
up
and
be
good
cyn
looked
up
hopefully
at
this
but
nattie
who
could
hardly
conceal
her
agitation
replied
coldly
i
do
not
see
that
anything
has
been
the
matter
and
placing
a
limp
hand
in
his
for
an
instant
turned
away
clem
bit
his
lip
then
took
out
his
watch
saying
i
believe
i
have
an
engagement
down
town
this
evening
i
shall
have
to
leave
you
now
i
fear
ladies
nattie
celebrated
his
departure
by
bursting
into
tears
that
she
vainly
tried
to
hide
and
was
detected
in
this
situation
on
the
sofa
by
cyn
cyn
arms
were
about
her
in
a
moment
and
cyn
voice
said
lovingly
what
is
it
dear
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
lately
trust
me
with
it
is
it
about
clem
with
a
determination
very
brave
and
unselfish
but
unfortunately
entirely
uncalled
for
not
to
mar
cyn
happy
love
by
her
sorrow
nattie
checked
the
tears
of
which
she
was
ashamed
and
answered
no
i
am
very
weak
and
foolish
the
idea
of
my
crying
like
a
i
am
only
unhappy
because
because
i
am
nobody
and
this
was
all
the
information
the
sympathetic
and
perplexed
cyn
could
obtain
sitting
that
night
on
a
low
cricket
before
the
fire
with
her
dark
hair
unbound
and
it
was
fortunate
for
jo
peace
of
mind
that
he
could
not
see
her
just
then
because
she
was
such
an
interesting
study
cyn
thought
it
all
over
and
could
not
as
she
told
herself
make
out
what
it
was
all
about
i
thought
everything
was
going
on
so
smoothly
she
mused
and
now
here
is
what
clem
himself
would
term
a
cross
on
the
wire
and
no
one
can
find
out
where
it
is
does
she
love
him
i
wonder
i
should
if
i
was
she
does
he
love
her
if
he
does
not
he
is
no
kind
of
a
hero
ah
i
know
what
would
test
the
matter
a
crisis
now
for
instance
if
the
house
would
only
get
on
fire
and
nat
burn
up
that
is
almost
and
clem
save
her
just
in
time
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
brings
these
heroes
to
terms
in
the
dramas
but
i
suppose
everything
is
so
different
in
real
life
clem
would
not
wake
up
in
time
and
she
would
burn
to
a
crisp
or
some
one
else
would
save
her
first
quimby
for
instance
he
is
always
doing
something
he
ought
not
no
i
do
think
it
would
do
to
risk
it
nevertheless
i
am
convinced
that
a
crisis
is
what
is
essential
to
complete
the
circuit
telegraphically
speaking
or
in
other
words
to
bring
down
the
curtain
on
every
body
embracing
everybody
with
great
chapter
xiii
the
wrong
woman
somewhat
exultant
over
the
new
aspect
of
affairs
and
unable
longer
to
endure
the
strain
of
the
load
of
love
he
was
carrying
about
with
him
quimby
came
to
a
desperate
determination
this
was
no
other
than
to
confide
in
his
and
once
dreaded
rival
and
then
provided
he
was
not
thrown
out
of
the
window
or
kicked
down
stairs
ask
his
advice
about
how
to
render
himself
clearly
understood
by
at
the
same
time
relating
his
former
unfortunate
attempt
this
programme
he
carried
into
effect
one
morning
as
clem
was
blacking
his
boots
perhaps
he
had
made
private
calculations
on
a
hitting
a
man
with
less
damage
than
some
larger
article
i
say
clem
quimby
began
i
i
want
to
ask
your
advice
you
know
i
am
at
your
service
my
dear
boy
replied
the
unsuspecting
clem
rubbing
away
at
his
boot
well
i
i
want
to
know
the
fact
is
i
i
am
boiling
over
with
love
what
exclaimed
clem
looking
up
with
an
amused
smile
you
are
not
in
love
with
cyn
too
are
you
with
cyn
these
words
were
balm
to
the
soul
of
quimby
and
gave
him
courage
to
answer
eagerly
ah
no
use
in
that
for
you
know
it
it
is
miss
rogers
nattie
you
know
the
left
clem
hand
but
not
to
fly
at
the
expectant
quimby
it
simply
dropped
onto
the
floor
while
clem
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
in
a
prolonged
whistle
is
it
possible
he
said
having
thus
relieved
himself
of
his
first
astonishment
i
might
have
suspected
as
much
if
i
had
stopped
to
think
though
yes
i
i
think
i
showed
it
plain
enough
you
know
said
quimby
candidly
you
see
i
i
tried
to
tell
her
of
it
once
before
you
came
here
when
you
were
invisible
you
know
but
some
way
she
she
just
understand
and
and
bolted
you
know
so
just
tell
me
how
to
do
it
that
is
a
good
fellow
for
do
it
i
must
clem
picked
up
his
and
very
deliberately
smeared
the
boot
he
had
just
polished
with
another
coat
of
blacking
before
answering
how
can
i
tell
you
he
said
at
last
you
do
suppose
proposing
is
an
habit
of
mine
do
you
my
dear
boy
i
never
proposed
in
my
life
but
you
you
ought
to
i
mean
you
will
sometime
you
know
just
give
me
a
a
start
you
know
pleaded
quimby
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
shall
i
call
her
and
propose
for
you
inquired
clem
somewhat
ironically
and
glancing
at
the
sounder
no
no
i
cried
quimby
in
great
alarm
at
this
proposition
she
might
think
you
meant
yourself
you
know
in
which
case
the
rejection
would
be
sure
said
clem
then
flinging
his
brush
savagely
into
a
corner
he
added
as
he
went
out
you
must
settle
it
yourself
old
fellow
no
one
can
help
us
in
those
matters
there
is
no
duplex
quimby
was
therefore
left
to
his
own
devices
and
his
own
devices
brought
about
a
most
extraordinary
result
that
same
evening
nattie
coming
over
to
cyn
room
and
finding
her
absent
sat
down
to
await
her
return
which
simonson
assured
her
would
be
very
soon
there
was
no
gas
lighted
and
in
the
dusk
nattie
remained
feeling
perhaps
an
affinity
with
the
somber
shadows
of
the
twilight
as
she
sat
musing
now
wishing
c
had
left
her
life
forever
when
he
left
it
with
the
odors
of
musk
and
about
him
and
now
despising
herself
for
the
weakness
she
found
it
so
hard
to
overcome
she
became
conscious
of
a
denser
shadow
in
the
shadows
of
the
open
door
i
i
beg
pardon
is
it
cyn
asked
this
shadow
in
the
voice
of
quimby
no
nattie
replied
cyn
is
out
i
i
beg
pardon
is
it
the
shadow
asked
with
accents
of
delight
nattie
acknowledged
the
you
and
you
you
are
alone
nattie
glanced
around
the
room
hoping
the
duchess
had
strayed
in
so
she
might
truthfully
say
no
but
she
was
compelled
to
reply
in
the
affirmative
glorious
opportunity
i
it
must
not
be
wasted
i
i
will
explain
you
know
he
exclaimed
excitedly
and
incoherently
but
to
surprise
instead
of
entering
he
darted
away
in
such
a
tremendous
hurry
that
he
stumbled
and
fell
and
she
distinctly
heard
his
skull
bang
against
his
own
door
but
his
last
words
were
too
ominous
and
she
was
too
well
acquainted
with
his
peculiarities
to
flatter
herself
she
was
permanently
relieved
of
his
company
he
had
perhaps
gone
to
brush
his
hair
or
take
some
quieting
drops
but
she
knew
he
had
certainly
not
gone
to
stay
and
not
being
exactly
in
the
humor
for
his
company
nattie
resolved
to
fly
ignominiously
afraid
of
returning
to
her
own
room
lest
she
might
meet
him
and
be
taken
captive
she
quietly
retired
into
cyn
in
a
few
moments
she
heard
him
stumbling
over
a
stool
in
the
parlor
and
was
just
thinking
that
if
he
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
remain
any
length
of
time
she
would
be
in
rather
a
predicament
when
to
her
surprise
she
heard
him
say
i
i
must
speak
i
i
hope
this
time
i
shall
remember
what
i
have
so
often
so
often
said
in
the
privacy
of
my
own
apartment
to
if
i
may
confess
it
to
a
pillow
a
pair
of
pants
and
a
coat
placed
in
a
chair
as
a
poor
effigy
of
of
you
you
know
will
you
will
you
do
speak
but
let
me
alone
hear
me
and
let
the
the
flow
of
language
come
he
paused
and
in
the
greatest
bewilderment
nattie
stared
at
the
opposite
wall
did
he
by
some
powerful
intuition
discern
she
was
within
hearing
distance
or
was
he
in
his
disappointment
rehearsing
to
her
empty
chair
before
nattie
could
decide
between
these
two
solutions
of
his
conduct
another
voice
the
voice
of
celeste
said
faintly
and
affectedly
oh
quimby
and
then
nattie
comprehended
the
situation
after
her
own
retreat
celeste
had
entered
and
taken
the
just
vacated
chair
it
was
twilight
celeste
wore
a
black
dress
like
hers
her
hair
was
dressed
in
the
same
style
and
was
the
same
color
and
quimby
had
mistaken
her
for
nattie
and
in
his
excitement
and
struggle
with
that
flow
of
language
he
did
not
notice
even
that
it
was
not
nattie
voice
saying
oh
quimby
for
he
continued
i
i
you
may
reject
me
i
am
afraid
you
will
but
i
must
say
it
you
know
i
must
or
i
shall
i
shall
explode
and
fly
into
atoms
here
celeste
gave
a
little
scream
but
he
went
on
determinedly
making
the
most
of
his
glorious
opportunity
i
i
am
not
like
other
fellows
you
know
that
is
i
mean
i
have
not
the
the
brass
if
i
may
so
express
myself
and
i
am
always
doing
something
wrong
but
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
the
question
is
could
you
get
used
to
it
for
i
have
a
heart
that
is
that
is
honest
and
that
beats
all
full
of
love
of
love
for
you
know
who
i
mean
there
was
a
murmured
oh
from
celeste
as
quimby
paused
to
wipe
from
his
brow
the
perspiration
called
forth
by
his
arduous
undertaking
what
shall
i
do
frantically
thought
the
perplexed
listener
divided
between
the
ludicrous
part
of
the
affair
and
her
desire
to
save
him
from
the
dilemma
into
which
he
was
rushing
what
i
do
oh
if
cyn
would
only
come
but
cyn
came
not
and
while
nattie
paused
irresolute
and
not
knowing
what
course
to
take
quimby
went
on
to
his
fate
i
have
thought
sometimes
that
you
liked
some
other
fellow
clem
i
mean
nattie
felt
herself
blush
in
the
darkness
but
i
do
hope
not
the
thought
has
made
me
boil
in
secret
often
and
he
loves
cyn
you
know
nattie
color
left
her
face
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
but
oh
and
he
went
down
on
to
his
knees
with
a
whack
that
made
the
vases
on
the
mantel
jingle
let
me
tell
you
what
i
tried
twice
before
to
say
what
is
always
in
my
thoughts
i
i
adore
you
the
ground
you
walk
on
and
have
ever
since
i
first
saw
your
nose
i
i
beg
pardon
but
i
fell
in
love
with
your
nose
and
will
you
can
you
tell
me
that
you
love
any
other
fellow
clem
i
mean
and
share
my
little
property
and
be
be
quimby
you
know
ah
really
i
such
a
trying
moment
but
dear
quimby
i
never
cared
for
clem
never
only
for
you
and
i
am
yours
with
these
words
celeste
precipitated
herself
into
his
arms
and
the
next
moment
nattie
heard
a
crash
as
they
both
fell
on
the
floor
the
sudden
shock
of
recognition
that
then
burst
upon
him
weakened
him
to
such
an
extent
that
he
could
not
support
himself
much
less
her
so
down
they
went
he
must
know
who
it
is
now
thought
nattie
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
meanwhile
celeste
had
picked
herself
up
but
quimby
still
remained
flat
on
the
floor
bracing
himself
up
by
his
hands
on
either
side
and
staring
at
her
motionless
fortunately
it
was
too
dark
for
her
to
see
the
expression
of
his
face
did
you
hurt
yourself
asked
celeste
at
length
let
me
help
you
up
we
are
to
help
each
other
now
you
know
quimby
groaned
oh
misery
he
gasped
this
my
destiny
is
too
much
for
me
oh
the
evil
deeds
of
darkness
listen
to
me
i
implore
you
it
is
all
a
mistake
i
thought
of
course
it
was
a
mistake
you
did
not
suppose
i
thought
you
fell
purposely
did
you
dear
quickly
interrupted
celeste
blindly
or
willfully
misunderstanding
who
shall
say
which
but
please
get
up
cyn
may
come
at
this
quimby
scrambled
to
his
feet
with
startling
suddenness
and
exclaiming
hastily
i
will
i
will
write
and
tell
you
all
i
have
an
engagement
now
with
a
friend
just
around
the
corner
he
rushed
from
the
room
and
would
have
flown
but
the
pertinacious
celeste
had
followed
and
just
as
he
reached
the
outside
hall
regardless
of
the
publicity
flung
herself
around
his
neck
this
time
without
bringing
him
to
the
ground
it
is
not
necessary
to
write
she
cried
pray
do
not
take
such
a
trifle
so
much
to
heart
remember
i
am
yours
and
another
voice
from
the
stairs
just
above
the
pair
interrupted
her
it
was
the
voice
of
fishblate
and
it
said
hugging
marry
her
i
i
will
wailed
the
now
alarmed
quimby
as
celeste
blushingly
withdrew
from
her
embrace
of
him
i
i
will
see
you
if
i
if
i
live
and
striking
his
forehead
with
his
hand
he
burst
away
bounded
frantically
down
the
stairs
and
fled
ejaculating
i
knew
it
i
had
a
presentiment
from
my
youth
excuse
his
eccentricity
pa
celeste
said
he
loves
me
much
poor
fellow
humph
get
enough
of
he
growled
with
contempt
and
he
has
a
nice
little
property
added
celeste
as
they
went
up
stairs
property
is
the
thing
fishblate
said
with
undisguised
plainness
nattie
emerged
from
her
retreat
on
the
hasty
exit
of
quimby
and
celeste
so
full
of
regret
for
the
flight
that
had
proved
so
disastrous
to
him
that
the
ludicrous
part
of
the
scene
just
enacted
was
forgotten
poor
quimby
she
thought
remorsefully
what
a
dreadful
fix
he
is
in
i
hope
he
will
get
out
of
it
and
i
am
so
sorry
for
my
share
in
it
how
strange
it
would
be
if
he
should
as
he
once
said
marry
the
wrong
woman
after
all
chapter
xiv
quimby
accepts
the
situation
when
quimby
rushed
out
into
the
street
it
was
with
some
wild
and
indefinite
intention
of
flying
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
but
recalled
to
his
senses
by
the
stares
of
the
he
concluded
he
had
better
first
return
and
get
his
hat
when
he
reached
his
own
room
where
clem
was
thoughtfully
pacing
the
floor
he
flung
himself
face
downwards
upon
the
bed
groaning
and
kicking
his
feet
spasmodically
what
is
the
matter
clem
inquired
i
done
it
now
i
done
it
now
was
all
the
answer
quimby
gave
him
has
she
rejected
you
asked
clem
his
mind
going
back
to
their
morning
conversation
no
no
she
has
accepted
me
wailed
quimby
with
a
prodigious
kick
shouted
clem
stopping
short
in
his
promenade
she
has
oh
she
has
moaned
the
wretched
victim
of
mistakes
i
am
engaged
oh
heavens
engaged
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
miss
rogers
has
accepted
you
inquired
clem
harshly
this
name
completely
unmanned
poor
quimby
and
he
began
to
cry
like
a
miss
rogers
no
never
never
but
celeste
celeste
echoed
clem
celeste
yes
i
oh
i
made
a
mistake
you
know
explained
quimby
wiping
his
eyes
on
the
bedspread
an
irresistible
smile
but
quickly
suppressed
curved
clem
lips
as
he
asked
but
how
could
you
possibly
make
such
a
mistake
as
that
come
cheer
up
my
boy
tell
me
and
let
me
help
you
out
quimby
looked
at
him
mournfully
it
it
was
dark
he
answered
dejectedly
she
sat
in
the
chair
the
lost
nattie
i
mean
it
was
she
for
she
spoke
to
me
why
did
i
not
seize
the
chance
then
but
no
i
left
her
to
to
rehearse
a
little
first
and
when
i
returned
oh
it
was
still
dark
and
i
did
not
know
a
transformation
had
been
effected
i
burst
forth
in
eloquence
and
oh
it
was
celeste
you
know
i
fled
she
followed
caught
and
hugged
me
in
the
hall
her
father
saw
roared
her
and
i
there
was
no
escape
you
know
but
my
dear
fellow
remonstrated
clem
you
can
explain
the
mistake
you
are
not
obliged
to
marry
celeste
because
you
accidentally
proposed
to
her
quimby
shook
his
head
hopelessly
she
she
would
sue
me
for
breach
of
promise
you
know
and
take
all
all
my
little
property
and
her
terrific
father
i
do
know
what
he
would
not
do
to
me
only
one
thing
could
make
me
brave
all
if
miss
rogers
nattie
would
say
it
might
have
been
had
not
this
fearful
mistake
occurred
i
would
face
even
old
fishblate
and
break
all
bonds
dear
old
fellow
i
am
afraid
she
nattie
would
have
rejected
you
in
any
case
she
is
a
flirt
said
clem
somewhat
savagely
she
leads
people
on
for
the
sake
of
dropping
them
when
it
suits
her
convenience
i
now
really
i
i
can
not
think
that
even
though
she
had
rejected
me
i
could
not
think
said
quimby
loyally
then
with
sudden
decision
i
will
settle
it
now
if
i
had
not
put
it
off
before
as
i
did
i
might
not
have
blundered
into
this
awful
fix
you
know
i
hear
them
in
cyn
room
now
cyn
and
nattie
come
with
me
i
i
will
have
witnesses
and
no
mistakes
this
time
you
know
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
clem
following
his
excited
friend
rather
reluctantly
i
am
going
to
find
out
if
she
nattie
likes
me
you
know
if
she
does
i
will
brave
celeste
her
fierce
father
the
law
if
not
why
then
i
must
be
a
martyr
anyway
you
know
and
i
do
care
how
big
a
one
i
am
so
saying
quimby
went
across
to
cyn
room
clem
not
exactly
liking
the
position
thrust
upon
him
but
unwilling
to
refuse
accompanying
him
meanwhile
nattie
had
pounced
upon
cyn
the
moment
she
returned
exclaiming
oh
cyn
such
a
dreadful
thing
has
happened
what
how
when
asked
cyn
while
from
the
effects
of
the
melodrama
she
had
just
been
witnessing
visions
of
clem
with
a
dozen
bullets
in
his
head
danced
before
her
eyes
quimby
poor
quimby
i
have
ruined
him
was
nattie
remorseful
and
unintelligible
answer
well
my
dear
if
you
could
possibly
be
a
trifle
lucid
perhaps
i
could
understand
the
plot
of
the
piece
said
cyn
decidedly
relieved
of
her
first
surmise
upon
which
nattie
half
laughing
and
half
crying
explained
but
the
ludicrous
side
was
too
much
for
cyn
and
she
could
only
laugh
what
a
farce
it
would
make
she
said
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
oh
cyn
nattie
said
reproachfully
think
how
dreadful
it
is
for
quimby
and
for
me
the
instrument
of
it
all
nonsense
my
dear
said
cyn
more
seriously
and
bringing
her
philosophy
to
bear
on
the
subject
it
was
not
your
fault
she
was
determined
to
have
him
in
any
case
had
it
been
you
as
he
supposed
you
would
of
course
have
declined
the
proffered
honor
and
she
would
have
caught
him
in
the
rebound
if
he
has
spirit
enough
he
can
get
out
of
marrying
her
in
some
way
if
not
she
will
make
him
a
good
wife
enough
men
you
know
as
she
says
prefer
to
marry
women
who
do
know
too
much
so
it
is
all
right
and
with
this
nattie
was
fain
to
be
content
but
she
felt
great
pity
for
the
poor
fellow
perhaps
because
of
the
unhappiness
in
her
own
heart
it
is
only
from
the
depths
of
our
own
sorrows
that
we
learn
to
feel
for
that
of
others
as
quimby
and
clem
entered
both
nattie
and
cyn
looked
surprised
and
curious
but
quimby
so
excited
now
that
his
usual
nervous
bashfulness
was
forgotten
said
immediately
i
i
beg
pardon
i
am
sure
for
calling
so
late
but
my
business
will
not
wait
and
i
wanted
clem
as
witness
he
and
cyn
so
as
to
make
no
mistake
now
then
turning
to
the
astonished
nattie
he
went
on
nattie
i
i
my
feelings
for
you
have
long
been
of
of
adoration
no
please
hear
me
as
she
made
a
gesture
to
interrupt
him
in
this
room
i
addressed
another
celeste
here
he
groaned
but
recovered
himself
and
went
on
in
the
dark
you
know
with
words
intended
for
you
i
want
to
know
now
what
had
i
not
been
so
deceived
you
would
have
said
but
what
difference
can
it
make
now
asked
nattie
hesitating
and
wishing
to
spare
him
as
he
paused
for
a
reply
every
difference
said
quimby
wildly
i
beg
you
to
to
answer
me
truly
in
order
that
i
may
know
what
course
to
take
then
since
you
wish
replied
nattie
with
a
pitying
glance
i
will
tell
you
that
as
a
friend
i
think
very
highly
of
you
and
always
shall
but
that
is
all
then
come
on
celeste
exclaimed
quimby
in
a
burst
of
despair
she
she
says
she
loves
me
and
i
i
may
get
used
to
it
in
time
all
but
her
teeth
he
added
in
his
strict
honesty
to
those
i
never
can
cyn
felt
a
mischievous
desire
to
hint
that
time
might
relieve
him
of
his
objection
but
restrained
herself
and
said
but
you
can
explain
the
matter
to
her
you
know
just
what
i
have
been
telling
him
said
clem
no
woman
would
force
herself
on
a
man
under
such
circumstances
she
would
i
feel
it
answered
the
unconvinced
quimby
miss
rogers
nattie
i
i
thank
you
i
i
shall
always
remember
you
as
something
unattainable
and
dear
and
hope
somebody
more
worthy
may
be
to
you
what
i
would
have
been
if
i
could
but
i
i
was
born
to
make
mistakes
you
know
and
i
i
am
used
to
it
and
ought
to
be
thankful
it
was
not
miss
kling
i
am
very
very
sorry
murmured
nattie
and
clem
saw
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
moral
never
make
love
in
the
dark
said
cyn
looking
with
solemn
warning
at
clem
be
sure
that
all
all
the
gas
in
the
room
is
lighted
if
ever
you
propose
added
quimby
miserably
to
his
friend
i
will
remember
said
clem
glancing
at
nattie
there
are
worse
mistakes
made
in
the
dark
than
on
the
wire
it
seems
far
far
worse
groaned
quimby
as
nattie
hastily
turned
her
head
aside
but
now
really
quimby
urged
cyn
seriously
do
be
sensible
do
not
be
foolish
enough
to
marry
a
woman
you
do
not
want
because
you
can
not
have
the
one
you
do
but
quimby
with
the
fear
of
old
fishblate
and
a
breach
of
promise
suit
and
a
dread
of
explanations
in
his
mind
moreover
having
firmly
decided
that
a
little
more
or
less
of
misery
did
not
matter
could
not
be
persuaded
to
take
any
steps
himself
or
allow
them
to
be
taken
to
free
himself
from
the
result
of
his
latest
mistake
therefore
it
came
about
to
the
surprise
of
those
not
in
the
secret
and
the
unconcealed
exultation
of
one
of
the
parties
immediately
concerned
that
the
engagement
of
quimby
and
celeste
was
announced
chapter
xv
one
summer
day
the
week
that
decided
quimby
fate
so
unexpectedly
and
brought
him
so
much
woe
to
cyn
brought
good
tidings
her
success
at
the
concert
had
been
so
decided
that
she
was
the
recipient
of
many
offers
for
the
coming
season
and
was
enabled
to
accept
those
that
promised
most
advantageously
no
one
was
more
honestly
glad
than
was
nattie
in
her
congratulations
nattie
who
had
fought
and
overcome
that
selfish
pain
and
bitter
wonder
of
hers
why
cyn
should
have
everything
and
she
nothing
since
the
approach
of
summer
a
of
project
among
them
had
been
a
little
picnic
party
in
the
woods
and
as
clem
now
proposed
to
get
it
up
in
honor
of
cyn
success
the
plan
was
immediately
carried
out
simonson
with
a
feeble
protest
because
miss
kling
was
not
invited
accompanied
them
the
them
of
course
consisted
of
cyn
nattie
clem
jo
and
the
newly
betrothed
ones
nature
was
kind
to
these
seekers
of
her
solitudes
and
gave
them
a
perfect
day
one
of
those
that
occur
in
our
uncertain
climate
less
often
than
might
be
wished
but
that
penetrate
everywhere
with
their
sunshine
when
they
do
come
even
into
hearts
where
sunshine
seldom
glances
so
for
the
nonce
our
friends
forgot
all
their
little
troubles
even
quimby
brightening
up
and
ceasing
to
think
of
his
engagement
as
they
stood
underneath
the
green
trees
by
the
banks
of
a
small
river
sunshine
everywhere
and
the
music
of
birds
in
the
air
is
it
not
glorious
cried
cyn
like
a
child
in
her
exuberance
why
not
camp
out
here
and
stay
all
summer
ecstatically
suggested
clem
as
he
fondled
his
fishing
tackle
but
it
might
not
always
be
pleasant
like
this
said
practical
simonson
when
the
sun
shines
we
forget
it
may
ever
storm
said
jo
and
looking
admiringly
at
cyn
as
he
spoke
is
our
artist
a
philosopher
as
well
as
all
the
rest
we
know
he
is
asked
cyn
laughing
a
very
little
one
five
feet
six
replied
jo
well
we
will
have
no
shadows
said
cyn
no
shadows
echoed
jo
then
turning
to
simonson
asked
i
hope
you
do
not
still
regret
miss
kling
i
suppose
she
would
spoil
it
all
that
good
lady
committed
herself
enough
to
say
well
really
i
must
say
remarked
celeste
who
now
gave
herself
many
airs
and
evidently
looked
upon
cyn
and
nattie
as
commonplace
creatures
engaged
i
must
say
now
that
you
are
speaking
of
her
that
she
does
in
a
way
that
is
not
pleasant
sometimes
she
actually
annoys
pa
i
thought
she
entertained
a
high
regard
for
the
tor
for
your
father
said
mischievous
cyn
that
is
exactly
it
replied
celeste
high
a
regard
truly
she
behaves
very
ridiculously
why
she
positively
waylays
pa
so
indelicate
in
a
woman
you
know
with
sublime
unconsciousness
of
ever
having
indulged
in
the
pastime
of
waylaying
herself
such
an
old
creature
too
she
is
always
coming
and
wanting
to
mend
his
old
clothes
and
stockings
poor
pa
actually
has
to
lock
himself
in
his
room
sometimes
the
vision
of
poor
pa
thus
pursued
was
too
much
for
the
gravity
of
the
company
and
there
was
a
general
laugh
it
is
true
asserted
celeste
now
is
it
ralfy
appealing
to
her
betrothed
with
appropriate
bashfulness
everybody
stared
at
this
no
one
before
ever
really
knew
that
quimby
possessed
a
front
door
to
his
name
and
he
as
surprised
as
any
one
at
the
cognomen
love
had
discovered
fell
back
on
a
rolling
log
and
clutched
his
legs
to
that
extent
that
they
must
have
been
black
and
blue
for
a
week
afterwards
clem
saved
the
discomfited
ralfy
the
necessity
of
replying
by
interposing
with
come
come
let
us
not
talk
on
such
incongruous
subjects
this
lovely
day
let
us
rather
talk
sentiment
and
he
gave
a
prodigious
wink
in
jo
direction
i
fear
we
are
not
a
very
sentimental
party
laughed
cyn
adding
mischievously
except
of
course
quimby
and
celeste
oh
i
i
am
not
i
assure
you
i
am
not
in
the
least
you
know
protested
quimby
taking
a
roll
on
the
log
never
felt
less
so
in
my
life
why
ralfy
exclaimed
celeste
reproachfully
and
to
his
distress
went
up
close
to
him
and
would
have
sat
down
by
his
side
but
for
the
uncontrollable
rolling
propensity
of
that
log
which
made
it
impossible
how
is
it
with
you
jo
queried
cyn
can
you
not
for
once
forget
your
horrible
hobby
and
be
a
little
sentimental
in
honor
of
the
day
jo
who
was
throwing
sticks
into
the
water
to
the
great
disturbance
of
the
bugs
and
annoyance
of
a
big
frog
made
a
somewhat
surprising
reply
decidedly
seriously
he
said
i
fear
if
i
should
attempt
it
i
might
get
too
much
in
earnest
oh
we
will
risk
that
so
please
begin
said
cyn
but
staring
at
him
a
little
as
she
spoke
jo
sentimental
just
imagine
it
will
you
risk
it
he
asked
still
seriously
and
with
so
peculiar
an
expression
that
she
could
reply
only
by
another
astonished
stare
but
really
it
does
not
pay
to
be
sentimental
as
you
all
ought
to
have
found
out
long
ago
as
jo
and
i
have
nattie
said
jestingly
yet
with
an
undertone
of
earnestness
then
said
clem
dryly
since
it
is
so
with
us
let
us
fish
and
he
threw
his
line
into
the
stream
cyn
jo
and
simonson
followed
his
example
quimby
declined
joining
in
the
sport
and
perhaps
likening
himself
to
the
fish
balanced
himself
on
the
log
and
looked
on
with
a
pathetic
face
celeste
as
in
duty
bound
remained
by
his
side
nattie
too
was
an
observer
only
and
from
the
expression
off
her
face
was
decidedly
not
amused
i
think
it
is
cruel
she
exclaimed
as
jo
took
a
fish
off
cyn
hook
i
i
quite
agree
with
you
quimby
replied
quickly
in
answer
to
nattie
observation
it
is
cruel
but
perhaps
the
fish
were
made
for
people
to
catch
suggested
the
pacific
simonson
who
had
not
yet
been
able
to
get
a
bite
yes
acquiesced
clem
pulling
up
a
skinny
little
fish
they
are
no
worse
off
than
we
poor
mortals
after
all
we
must
each
fulfill
our
destiny
whether
man
or
fish
yes
it
is
all
fate
exclaimed
quimby
vehemently
we
can
not
help
ourselves
you
believe
in
fate
then
i
do
think
i
do
said
cyn
with
a
glance
at
its
victim
on
the
log
what
incentive
would
we
have
to
any
effort
if
we
were
sure
everything
was
marked
out
for
us
in
advance
that
is
a
question
requiring
too
much
effort
for
us
to
discuss
on
a
warm
day
said
nattie
certain
circumstances
must
bring
about
certain
results
you
will
acknowledge
clem
gravely
remarked
but
it
is
said
that
every
soul
that
is
born
has
a
twin
somewhere
and
if
so
that
must
be
fate
said
simonson
miss
kling
theory
i
believe
laughed
nattie
if
it
is
so
the
right
ones
do
often
come
together
said
quimby
gloomily
are
an
exception
then
to
the
general
rule
simpered
celeste
quimby
groaned
and
then
murmured
something
about
the
toothache
poor
fellow
said
cyn
in
a
low
voice
to
nattie
after
all
there
something
in
fate
nattie
sighed
perhaps
so
she
said
well
we
will
not
get
solemn
over
fate
said
jo
cheerily
then
in
a
lower
voice
as
he
glanced
at
cyn
he
added
yet
and
do
not
frighten
away
what
few
fish
there
are
here
with
your
theories
commanded
clem
although
this
mandate
was
obeyed
and
for
a
time
silence
reigned
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
all
singing
a
gay
song
started
by
clem
himself
even
quimby
joining
in
the
chorus
with
a
feeble
tenor
but
they
were
tired
of
fishing
by
that
time
and
began
to
feel
as
if
a
little
refreshment
would
not
be
out
of
place
and
would
indeed
enhance
the
loveliness
of
nature
so
a
fire
was
made
and
unpacked
it
will
take
a
good
many
of
those
fish
for
a
mouthful
declared
clem
who
was
cook
you
may
have
my
share
i
ca
eat
creatures
i
have
seen
squirm
said
nattie
ah
you
fastidious
young
woman
what
shall
i
ever
do
with
you
if
you
are
cast
away
on
a
desert
island
with
me
exclaimed
clem
in
mock
despair
set
up
a
telegraph
wire
and
then
she
would
need
nothing
more
insinuated
cyn
and
get
snubbed
for
my
pains
muttered
clem
but
nattie
caught
the
words
and
an
expression
of
distress
passed
over
her
face
this
reminds
me
of
that
feast
cyn
declared
as
they
sealed
themselves
wherever
convenient
with
a
dish
of
whatever
was
handy
only
more
so
added
clem
what
feast
asked
celeste
curiously
one
we
had
once
cyn
replied
evasively
glad
there
was
something
celeste
did
not
know
about
in
fact
in
the
matter
of
curiosity
celeste
was
an
embryo
miss
kling
i
am
sorry
we
have
no
quimby
remarked
clem
with
an
expression
of
transparent
innocence
quimby
could
only
reply
with
a
groan
the
recollections
awakened
were
too
much
what
is
the
matter
now
ralfy
asked
the
loving
celeste
again
quimby
muttered
something
about
that
tooth
oh
said
celeste
tenderly
you
really
must
have
it
out
ralfy
the
possibility
of
being
obliged
to
part
with
a
sound
tooth
in
restored
him
for
the
time
being
but
he
was
not
the
only
one
to
whom
the
retrospect
brought
a
momentary
pain
nattie
sighed
as
she
looked
back
to
the
day
that
had
brought
clem
but
not
restored
as
she
then
supposed
but
taken
away
her
the
salubrious
air
and
the
invigorating
odor
of
the
forest
adds
immeasurably
to
the
natural
capacity
of
the
appetite
commented
jo
gravely
as
he
passed
his
plate
for
the
seventh
fish
ah
sighed
celeste
who
prided
herself
on
her
delicacy
i
never
could
eat
more
than
would
satisfy
a
mouse
and
since
my
engagement
simpering
i
can
not
swallow
enough
to
scarce
keep
me
alive
quimby
looked
up
eagerly
i
i
beg
pardon
but
if
the
if
the
engagement
weighs
upon
you
i
i
am
willing
to
release
you
you
know
he
exclaimed
hopefully
you
jealous
creature
replied
celeste
archly
you
know
ralfy
that
no
consideration
could
make
me
release
you
quimby
knew
it
only
too
well
and
sighed
as
he
picked
a
chicken
bone
a
great
objection
to
dining
in
the
woods
is
that
one
is
apt
to
find
his
food
unexpectedly
seasoned
said
clem
as
he
captured
a
bug
of
an
adventurous
spirit
that
had
sought
to
investigate
the
contents
of
his
plate
is
it
strange
that
bugs
do
seem
half
so
bad
in
our
food
here
as
they
would
at
home
said
simonson
oh
we
can
get
used
to
anything
if
we
only
think
so
said
cyn
bringing
her
cheery
philosophy
to
the
front
yes
assented
quimby
mournfully
i
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
cyn
laughed
and
then
proposed
the
health
of
the
betrothed
pair
which
was
drank
in
lager
beer
and
to
which
quimby
bolstered
up
by
celeste
attempted
to
respond
but
collapsed
in
the
middle
of
the
third
sentence
and
with
the
words
thank
you
and
i
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
sat
down
wiped
his
forehead
on
his
napkin
and
looked
intensely
miserable
after
that
they
toasted
cyn
and
then
dots
and
dashes
and
last
jo
with
mock
solemnity
proposed
fate
and
just
then
quimby
met
with
a
fresh
mishap
and
came
near
ending
his
sufferings
in
a
watery
grave
only
the
water
did
not
happen
to
be
quite
deep
enough
arising
from
the
rock
that
had
served
him
for
a
pivot
on
which
to
eat
his
dinner
he
stumbled
fell
and
rolled
over
and
over
down
the
bank
and
into
the
river
with
a
tremendous
splash
every
one
jumped
up
in
consternation
oh
clem
jo
shrieked
celeste
wringing
her
hands
and
rushing
down
to
the
water
edge
save
him
save
my
darling
ralfy
ralfy
however
was
equal
to
saving
his
own
life
this
time
the
water
was
only
up
to
his
waist
and
he
had
already
picked
himself
up
and
was
wading
ashore
i
i
am
all
right
he
said
looking
up
at
his
anxious
friends
with
a
reassuring
smile
i
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
as
clem
assisted
him
up
the
bank
the
thought
came
into
cyn
head
why
would
it
not
be
a
good
idea
to
push
nat
accidentally
into
the
river
so
clem
might
rescue
her
and
thus
bring
about
that
much
to
be
desired
crisis
but
remembering
that
water
would
run
the
colors
of
her
dress
and
farther
how
dreadfully
unbecoming
it
was
to
be
wet
a
fact
fully
demonstrated
by
the
present
appearance
of
quimby
cyn
rejected
the
idea
as
not
exactly
feasible
they
left
quimby
drying
on
a
sunny
bank
with
celeste
as
guardian
angel
love
and
the
remains
of
the
repast
to
cheer
her
and
the
consciousness
that
his
clothes
were
shrinking
on
him
as
they
dried
to
divert
and
wandered
off
through
the
woods
and
over
the
hills
gathering
on
the
way
so
many
flowers
and
green
things
that
cyn
declared
they
looked
like
birnam
wood
coming
to
dunsinane
at
first
they
were
all
together
then
straggled
apart
simonson
being
the
first
dereliction
as
she
was
not
quite
equal
to
climbing
as
fast
as
the
young
people
thus
it
came
about
that
nattie
found
herself
alone
with
clem
and
suddenly
stopping
with
some
embarrassment
but
steadily
said
there
is
something
i
wish
to
say
to
you
you
have
spoken
several
times
of
late
about
my
you
i
want
to
say
i
have
not
intentionally
done
so
that
i
have
the
same
the
same
friendship
for
you
as
always
and
that
i
wish
you
every
happiness
what
may
have
appeared
to
you
as
strange
or
cold
in
my
conduct
of
late
is
due
to
secrets
of
my
own
clem
look
at
her
scrutinizingly
as
she
spoke
and
the
flowers
he
had
gathered
fell
unheeded
from
his
hands
it
has
never
been
wish
that
any
coldness
should
come
between
us
you
know
that
nattie
he
replied
earnestly
from
our
first
acquaintance
the
old
acquaintance
over
the
wire
you
have
held
the
same
place
in
my
heart
the
place
next
to
cyn
was
nattie
involuntary
bitter
thought
but
she
instantly
stifled
the
feeling
and
answered
thank
you
clem
and
i
hope
we
may
always
be
the
same
friends
at
this
clem
took
an
impetuous
step
towards
her
and
would
have
said
who
can
tell
what
had
not
at
the
same
moment
simonson
very
much
out
of
breath
come
up
with
them
nattie
was
not
sorry
she
had
wished
to
say
to
him
what
she
had
that
he
might
not
think
her
changed
manner
of
late
had
been
caused
by
any
feeling
of
dislike
and
might
understand
she
wished
him
success
with
cyn
but
she
had
no
desire
to
prolong
the
interview
and
gladly
walked
on
by
the
side
of
the
puffing
simonson
clem
however
looked
displeased
and
followed
with
a
thoughtful
face
so
thoughtful
that
simonson
noticed
and
wondered
at
his
preoccupation
meanwhile
cyn
with
jo
were
far
in
advance
and
had
turned
into
a
that
led
toward
a
slight
rising
sauntering
on
cyn
talking
merrily
jo
unusually
quiet
until
suddenly
stopping
she
exclaimed
dear
me
we
have
lost
sight
of
every
one
had
we
not
better
return
no
i
do
not
want
to
answered
jo
bluntly
do
you
not
as
you
say
only
we
must
not
lose
them
possibly
they
may
stroll
this
way
shall
we
sit
down
and
without
waiting
for
a
response
cyn
seated
herself
on
a
big
rock
by
the
side
of
the
pathway
although
jo
was
not
romantic
he
had
an
and
could
not
but
note
the
beauty
of
the
scene
before
him
a
scene
he
did
not
need
to
reproduce
on
canvas
to
remember
ever
after
the
mountains
in
the
background
the
narrow
path
sloping
down
from
the
near
hill
to
where
on
the
gray
and
rock
cyn
sat
her
dark
eyes
mellow
with
the
summer
sunshine
and
the
cherry
ribbons
of
her
hat
giving
the
requisite
touch
of
color
to
make
the
picture
perfect
for
a
moment
he
stood
in
silent
admiration
then
taking
off
his
hat
and
smoothing
down
his
shaven
locks
he
said
to
tell
the
truth
cyn
i
do
hope
they
will
not
stroll
this
way
they
are
around
altogether
too
much
i
never
can
have
a
quiet
talk
with
you
i
declare
i
believe
in
addition
to
your
being
unsentimental
and
all
that
you
are
becoming
a
confirmed
grumbler
exclaimed
cyn
as
she
caught
one
of
the
boughs
of
the
tree
overhead
and
turned
a
face
towards
him
jo
looked
at
her
and
a
queer
expression
came
over
his
face
am
i
he
said
slowly
well
would
you
like
to
see
me
sentimental
would
you
like
to
see
me
make
a
fool
of
myself
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
cried
cyn
then
exclaimed
jo
planting
himself
directly
in
front
of
her
here
goes
now
i
am
going
to
astonish
you
very
much
cyn
very
well
i
am
all
impatience
go
on
but
it
is
no
joke
he
replied
in
protest
to
her
laughing
face
if
i
am
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
i
am
going
to
do
it
in
dead
earnest
that
is
the
way
of
course
responded
cyn
but
beginning
to
look
a
little
surprised
for
jo
seemed
very
much
excited
and
his
manner
indicated
anything
but
a
jest
extraordinary
creature
that
jo
his
next
proceeding
was
even
more
strange
that
was
to
ask
the
apparently
irrelevant
question
do
you
remember
what
we
were
all
saying
a
short
time
ago
about
fate
certainly
but
are
you
going
to
favor
me
with
a
dissertation
on
fate
instead
of
making
a
fool
of
yourself
no
was
the
solemn
reply
have
a
little
patience
cyn
the
fact
is
you
are
my
fate
there
is
no
mistake
about
it
and
must
be
either
cruel
or
kind
and
there
no
alternative
cyn
surprise
increased
visibly
i
am
sure
i
do
not
understand
you
at
all
how
queer
you
are
jo
of
course
i
am
queer
when
a
man
throws
his
theories
and
hobbies
to
the
winds
and
confesses
himself
conquered
he
is
apt
to
be
queer
is
he
not
can
you
not
understand
that
i
jo
norton
who
have
always
scoffed
at
sentiment
and
proudly
declared
myself
incapable
of
being
the
victim
of
love
am
ready
yes
and
longing
to
make
as
big
a
fool
of
myself
as
the
veriest
spooniest
youth
in
existence
and
all
for
love
of
you
cyn
to
this
exceedingly
novel
declaration
of
love
cyn
responded
by
releasing
the
bough
she
held
and
staring
at
him
with
distended
eyes
and
a
perfectly
blank
face
for
once
in
her
life
speechless
i
told
you
i
was
going
to
astonish
you
said
jo
quaintly
in
answer
to
her
prolonged
stare
and
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
can
not
believe
i
really
love
you
i
did
not
myself
for
a
long
time
and
i
would
not
after
i
knew
it
but
it
is
a
fact
no
joke
no
mistake
but
a
sober
serious
fact
i
love
you
love
you
love
you
jo
voice
grew
very
fervent
as
he
uttered
these
last
words
and
was
in
such
striking
contrast
to
his
ordinary
manner
that
cyn
could
but
see
that
this
was
indeed
no
joke
you
you
love
and
me
she
gasped
yes
i
could
not
help
it
i
have
only
known
it
within
a
few
days
but
i
think
i
have
loved
you
ever
since
we
first
met
only
those
confounded
theories
of
mine
blinded
me
well
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
questioned
cyn
unable
yet
to
recover
from
her
bewilderment
jo
looked
at
her
wistfully
i
know
i
am
homely
cyn
and
i
am
poor
i
have
nothing
to
offer
you
but
an
honest
loving
and
true
heart
i
suppose
a
man
who
is
in
love
is
naturally
unreasonable
i
never
was
in
love
before
you
know
but
an
extravagant
hope
will
whisper
to
me
that
even
this
little
might
not
be
unappreciated
by
you
and
as
he
spoke
jo
face
was
so
transfigured
that
it
could
no
longer
be
called
plain
cyn
gazed
at
him
in
wonder
and
recovering
partly
from
her
first
surprise
an
unusual
seriousness
came
over
her
own
handsome
face
as
she
answered
earnestly
it
is
not
unappreciated
oh
no
jo
nothing
to
offer
me
but
an
honest
loving
and
true
heart
you
say
why
that
is
everything
then
will
you
accept
it
may
i
try
and
win
your
love
he
asked
eagerly
advancing
close
to
her
i
will
work
very
hard
to
make
myself
worthy
of
it
and
to
win
a
name
you
need
not
be
ashamed
to
bear
i
lay
myself
my
life
at
your
feet
cyn
and
this
is
unsentimental
jo
cyn
exclaimed
involuntarily
this
is
unsentimental
jo
he
answered
in
all
humility
do
with
him
what
you
will
he
is
all
yours
into
cyn
expressive
eyes
came
some
emotion
i
am
so
sorry
she
said
sadly
so
very
very
sorry
what
shall
i
say
what
shall
i
do
i
like
you
so
much
as
a
friend
but
what
you
ask
jo
could
never
be
the
sun
sank
behind
the
distant
hills
and
a
shadow
such
as
had
fallen
over
the
woods
behind
them
settled
on
jo
face
the
idea
is
new
to
you
at
least
think
it
over
do
not
leave
me
without
a
little
hope
he
entreated
jo
i
wish
yes
i
wish
that
i
could
love
you
as
you
deserve
to
be
loved
said
cyn
earnestly
but
it
can
not
be
it
never
could
be
do
not
deceive
yourself
with
false
hopes
friends
always
jo
but
lovers
never
ah
exclaimed
jo
bitterly
unable
to
restrain
his
jealousy
it
is
clem
who
stands
between
us
who
stands
between
us
echoed
cyn
astounded
for
the
second
time
that
day
there
now
i
have
lowered
myself
in
your
estimation
i
am
but
a
blundering
fool
cyn
you
see
i
am
selfish
in
my
love
and
i
have
not
yet
become
sentimental
enough
to
be
willing
to
see
another
fellow
win
what
is
all
the
world
to
me
cyn
face
grew
red
as
was
the
sky
when
the
sun
had
gone
down
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
am
in
love
with
clem
she
asked
angrily
i
would
not
insinuate
it
for
all
the
world
if
you
are
not
was
eager
reply
i
am
not
experienced
in
love
matters
but
i
am
quite
sure
he
loves
you
and
he
is
very
handsome
he
added
ruefully
what
a
dreadful
combination
of
circumstances
cried
cyn
distractedly
but
pshaw
it
impossible
impossible
no
indeed
why
it
was
by
being
so
jealous
of
him
that
i
first
awoke
to
the
fact
that
i
was
in
love
with
you
myself
besides
every
one
has
noticed
his
fondness
for
you
they
have
vehemently
and
smiting
the
rock
where
she
sat
with
her
hand
as
she
spoke
but
this
is
truly
awful
then
you
do
not
care
for
him
questioned
jo
joyfully
care
for
him
repeated
cyn
irritably
of
course
i
care
for
him
is
it
not
my
pet
scheme
that
he
should
marry
nattie
certainly
it
is
and
has
been
from
the
first
and
now
if
he
has
gone
and
fallen
in
love
with
a
nice
predicament
we
will
all
be
in
but
you
must
be
mistaken
i
can
not
believe
him
capable
of
such
a
thing
the
only
reason
i
have
to
fear
it
is
that
i
would
not
have
credited
it
of
yesterday
but
you
see
i
do
love
you
you
believe
i
do
do
you
not
cyn
asked
jo
too
eager
to
press
his
own
suit
to
give
much
thought
to
nattie
and
clem
why
will
you
not
try
and
love
me
as
you
do
not
love
clem
am
i
so
homely
as
to
be
repulsive
to
you
homely
nonsense
replied
cyn
momentarily
putting
aside
her
newest
anxiety
for
the
previous
one
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
had
rather
marry
you
than
any
man
i
know
would
you
would
you
really
seizing
her
hand
hopefully
then
why
will
you
not
cyn
allowed
her
hand
to
remain
in
his
as
she
said
slowly
and
impressively
i
can
not
marry
that
is
entirely
out
of
the
question
for
me
of
my
life
love
can
form
no
part
but
i
thought
you
believed
in
love
said
jo
looking
perplexed
but
clinging
to
her
hand
as
a
sort
of
anchor
i
do
i
believe
it
is
the
best
happiness
of
life
but
it
can
not
be
for
me
why
i
will
tell
you
i
owe
this
much
in
return
for
what
you
have
given
me
what
i
prize
even
though
i
am
compelled
to
refuse
it
what
stands
between
us
is
the
memory
of
a
love
gone
forever
what
exclaimed
jo
astounded
in
his
turn
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
that
you
the
gayest
of
the
gay
that
jo
stopped
unable
to
proceed
you
hardly
expected
to
find
me
in
the
of
the
victim
of
a
broken
heart
did
you
questioned
cyn
with
a
smile
i
admit
i
do
not
exactly
answer
to
the
average
description
and
my
heart
is
not
broken
there
is
only
a
blank
in
it
something
dead
that
can
never
live
again
once
i
loved
a
man
with
all
my
heart
jo
sighed
with
all
the
illusion
of
youth
and
he
loved
me
the
difference
between
his
love
and
mine
was
that
mine
was
forever
and
his
was
for
a
day
impossible
interrupted
jo
no
man
who
once
loved
you
could
ever
change
he
happened
to
be
one
of
the
kind
who
i
never
really
knew
the
cause
it
might
have
been
another
woman
you
know
there
always
another
woman
or
another
man
added
jo
gloomily
yes
assented
cyn
and
continued
he
was
one
of
the
kind
i
think
now
who
are
incapable
of
appreciating
a
woman
love
and
consequently
unworthy
of
it
but
unfortunately
i
did
not
know
this
and
wasted
mine
on
him
so
he
and
love
went
out
of
my
life
forever
but
with
a
proud
raising
of
her
head
i
would
not
be
weak
enough
to
allow
all
my
life
to
be
ruined
because
one
part
of
it
was
wrecked
with
so
much
gone
there
still
remained
something
and
of
that
i
made
the
most
this
is
why
my
art
is
everything
to
me
and
why
i
can
not
marry
you
but
it
seems
to
me
unreasonable
that
because
you
loved
one
man
who
was
unworthy
you
should
refuse
the
love
of
another
who
would
try
very
hard
to
make
you
forget
that
first
sad
experience
argued
jo
give
me
what
you
have
left
cyn
if
it
be
but
dead
ashes
i
will
thank
god
for
the
gift
and
perhaps
at
some
future
day
in
response
to
my
devotion
even
from
those
ashes
shall
arise
another
love
so
strong
so
intense
that
in
comparison
the
old
shall
be
but
as
some
trouble
of
childhood
whose
remembrance
can
not
awaken
even
a
passing
pain
the
fervor
of
an
honest
affection
made
jo
truly
eloquent
and
his
true
blue
eyes
met
the
dark
ones
of
cyn
glowing
with
earnestness
and
love
and
for
a
moment
she
looked
at
him
and
hesitated
then
she
arose
saying
resolutely
no
jo
no
do
not
tempt
me
the
experiment
would
be
too
dangerous
to
give
you
a
affection
in
return
for
your
whole
heart
would
only
be
misery
for
us
both
more
misery
than
i
am
bringing
to
you
now
i
respect
and
esteem
you
as
i
said
before
we
will
be
friends
comrades
always
no
more
as
she
spoke
she
extended
her
hand
to
him
in
farewell
to
all
his
hopes
and
so
understanding
he
clasped
it
a
sadness
on
his
face
she
had
never
seen
there
before
as
you
will
cyn
he
replied
brokenly
but
i
shall
love
you
forever
as
he
spoke
from
below
came
the
cry
cyn
jo
where
are
you
we
are
going
coming
cyn
clear
voice
answered
back
one
moment
jo
said
detaining
her
may
i
may
i
kiss
you
once
cyn
once
and
for
the
last
time
there
were
tears
in
cyn
eyes
she
bent
her
handsome
head
their
lips
met
then
without
a
word
they
went
on
together
to
join
those
who
awaited
them
and
it
was
thus
fate
decreed
for
these
two
love
brings
the
most
intense
sorrows
the
keenest
joys
of
life
but
there
must
always
be
some
lives
into
which
comes
only
the
sadness
and
none
of
the
bliss
of
loving
chapter
xvi
leaving
clem
on
their
arrival
at
the
hotel
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
green
stuff
they
had
brought
from
the
woods
cyn
with
a
trace
of
melancholy
on
her
sunny
face
followed
nattie
to
her
room
for
joyous
picnic
with
its
gay
beginning
had
ended
sadly
enough
for
her
i
want
to
ask
you
something
cyn
said
with
frank
directness
as
she
carefully
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
that
is
are
you
can
you
be
foolish
enough
to
imagine
that
clem
and
i
are
in
love
with
each
other
the
small
basket
nattie
held
in
her
hand
fell
to
the
floor
at
this
unexpected
question
had
cyn
drawn
forth
a
and
playfully
clipped
off
her
nose
she
could
not
have
been
more
astounded
if
you
can
possibly
reduce
your
eyes
to
their
ordinary
size
and
give
me
a
candid
yes
or
no
i
will
be
obliged
cyn
said
rather
petulantly
after
waiting
in
vain
for
an
answer
the
events
of
the
day
had
sorely
tried
her
usually
even
temper
a
little
tremulously
while
a
burning
flush
covered
her
face
nattie
answered
her
i
i
have
heard
it
intimated
you
have
heard
it
intimated
that
means
yes
to
my
question
said
cyn
then
sinking
despairingly
on
the
lounge
she
added
here
is
a
crisis
of
which
i
never
dreamed
not
understanding
very
well
and
moreover
much
agitated
by
the
subject
nattie
knew
not
what
to
say
this
is
awful
went
on
cyn
savagely
beating
the
pillow
with
her
fist
what
contrary
things
love
affairs
are
fearful
of
having
in
some
way
betrayed
her
secret
the
only
conclusion
she
could
draw
from
cyn
extraordinary
outburst
nattie
stood
looking
guiltily
at
the
floor
a
few
moments
then
recovering
herself
she
went
to
cyn
and
said
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
i
do
not
just
comprehend
your
meaning
dear
but
it
may
be
you
think
i
might
not
quite
like
the
idea
on
account
of
that
that
first
affair
on
the
wire
if
so
dismiss
the
thought
you
and
clem
are
suited
to
each
other
and
nattie
stopped
unable
to
continue
cyn
who
had
been
beating
the
innocent
pillow
as
if
it
was
the
cause
of
all
this
while
nattie
was
speaking
now
threw
it
across
the
room
as
she
exclaimed
oh
the
perversity
of
human
nature
oh
you
degenerate
girl
as
if
i
cared
for
clem
in
that
way
have
i
not
from
the
first
set
my
heart
on
this
romance
ending
in
the
only
way
it
could
rightfully
end
a
sudden
light
came
into
nattie
face
but
it
died
away
in
a
moment
then
you
do
not
care
for
him
poor
clem
she
said
in
a
low
voice
poor
clem
indeed
cried
cyn
pacing
the
floor
excitedly
i
can
not
no
i
can
not
believe
it
of
him
he
certainly
has
sagacity
enough
not
to
run
his
head
against
a
beam
in
broad
daylight
even
if
jo
had
not
she
was
about
to
add
but
checked
herself
suddenly
not
for
the
world
would
she
betray
jo
confidence
what
had
passed
between
them
should
be
a
secret
always
never
again
to
be
mentioned
but
never
forgotten
in
the
friendship
and
companionship
of
after
years
you
must
be
very
difficult
to
suit
dear
if
you
do
not
like
clem
said
nattie
with
unconscious
significance
after
waiting
in
vain
for
cyn
to
finish
her
sentence
it
is
not
that
replied
cyn
somewhat
sadly
do
you
not
know
i
have
only
one
love
music
poor
clem
again
said
nattie
from
the
depths
of
her
tender
heart
for
i
know
he
loves
you
dear
he
could
not
help
it
who
could
such
words
would
have
been
sweet
to
the
vanity
of
an
ordinary
woman
but
on
cyn
they
had
a
very
opposite
effect
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
if
one
can
not
laugh
and
joke
and
enjoy
one
self
with
friends
without
being
made
love
to
she
said
annoyed
then
looking
scrutinizingly
at
nattie
she
asked
and
you
did
you
really
wish
clem
and
i
might
love
each
other
nattie
played
nervously
with
the
fringe
of
her
dress
hesitated
then
replied
in
a
low
tone
i
fear
i
did
not
cyn
then
it
may
come
right
yet
exclaimed
cyn
hopefully
nattie
shook
her
head
and
he
loving
you
oh
no
she
said
i
shall
never
be
able
to
say
to
what
you
term
your
romance
of
the
dots
and
dashes
cyn
in
fact
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
there
are
some
people
born
to
go
through
life
missing
both
its
best
and
its
worst
and
that
i
am
one
pray
do
not
say
that
urged
cyn
too
disturbed
to
bring
her
easy
philosophy
to
bear
on
the
situation
of
all
things
do
not
get
morbid
but
it
is
the
truth
persisted
nattie
even
my
name
for
instance
proves
it
i
was
christened
nathalie
a
very
fine
poetic
name
but
in
all
my
life
no
one
ever
called
me
by
it
i
was
always
mediocre
nattie
and
have
curtailed
you
down
to
nat
said
cyn
with
whimsical
remorse
but
what
a
tangle
we
are
in
first
it
was
the
man
of
musk
and
bear
grease
who
came
between
you
then
when
he
was
explained
away
came
blundering
i
why
did
you
not
lock
me
out
of
sight
somewhere
i
would
have
done
it
myself
had
i
known
ironically
what
an
extremely
fascinating
and
dangerous
person
i
was
at
this
nattie
could
not
help
smiling
is
was
not
your
fault
it
was
fate
she
said
her
smile
becoming
a
sigh
that
cyn
echoed
for
she
thought
of
jo
but
yet
unconvinced
she
said
fate
no
it
can
not
be
i
think
better
of
clem
than
to
believe
he
too
has
made
a
mistake
like
quimby
and
fallen
in
love
with
the
wrong
woman
then
starting
up
she
exclaimed
tragically
who
ah
who
shall
cut
the
gordian
knot
and
bring
about
a
crisis
that
shall
cause
this
love
to
terminate
in
as
if
invoked
by
cyn
words
there
came
a
sneeze
from
outside
and
miss
kling
pushed
open
the
door
unceremoniously
i
wish
to
have
some
conversation
with
you
miss
rogers
she
said
in
a
tone
of
severity
some
other
time
if
you
please
nattie
replied
impatiently
for
her
talk
with
cyn
had
unnerved
her
just
now
i
am
engaged
miss
kling
drew
herself
up
and
said
with
even
more
austerity
there
is
no
time
like
the
present
and
since
miss
archer
is
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
for
her
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
nattie
frowned
but
cyn
not
unwilling
to
be
diverted
even
by
miss
kling
from
the
topic
that
was
so
annoying
her
said
very
well
we
are
listening
miss
kling
miss
rogers
proceeded
miss
kling
solemnly
after
a
preparatory
sneeze
i
know
the
emphasis
on
the
last
word
was
truly
tremendous
and
nattie
started
astonished
while
cyn
looked
up
with
awakened
curiosity
may
i
inquire
what
you
mean
by
all
inquired
nattie
stiffly
yes
repeated
miss
kling
without
heeding
the
question
i
know
all
i
have
for
some
time
suspected
that
something
underhanded
was
going
on
now
i
know
what
it
is
that
has
been
so
carefully
concealed
from
me
i
have
long
objected
to
your
associates
miss
rogers
but
pardon
me
but
that
certainly
does
not
concern
you
interrupted
cyn
disdainfully
miss
kling
looked
at
her
and
sneezed
a
sinister
sneeze
it
concerns
me
to
know
what
kind
of
people
i
have
in
my
house
she
replied
and
since
you
force
me
to
speak
out
miss
archer
i
will
say
that
in
my
opinion
no
truly
modest
and
proper
girl
would
become
intimate
with
those
who
pad
their
legs
and
paint
their
faces
and
show
themselves
to
the
public
this
insinuation
struck
cyn
so
comically
that
she
could
hardly
suppress
a
laugh
my
suspicions
to
return
to
what
i
was
about
to
say
miss
rogers
were
first
awakened
by
hearing
that
that
instrument
cyn
and
nattie
exchanged
looks
of
intelligence
you
have
here
going
when
i
knew
you
were
not
in
the
room
and
now
as
i
said
i
know
i
pass
over
the
audacity
of
such
proceedings
on
premises
but
their
utter
immorality
is
too
much
for
me
to
bear
yes
i
found
a
wire
and
know
where
it
leads
into
the
room
of
two
young
men
that
any
young
woman
should
so
immodest
as
to
establish
telegraphic
communication
between
her
and
the
of
two
young
men
is
beyond
my
comprehension
cyn
felt
a
mischievous
desire
to
inquire
how
it
would
have
struck
her
had
it
been
the
of
young
man
nattie
who
had
flushed
crimson
at
the
first
knowledge
of
miss
kling
discovery
now
drew
herself
up
and
replied
with
dignity
really
miss
kling
i
think
this
extravagance
of
language
utterly
uncalled
for
i
admit
it
was
not
exactly
correct
for
me
to
allow
the
wire
to
be
run
without
consulting
you
but
beyond
that
there
was
nothing
reprehensible
in
my
conduct
miss
kling
held
up
her
hands
in
horror
nothing
reprehensible
in
being
connected
by
a
telegraph
wire
with
two
young
men
she
exclaimed
nothing
excuse
my
intrusion
but
cyn
will
you
please
inform
me
if
i
am
to
stand
all
night
loaded
with
green
stuff
like
a
farmer
on
a
market
day
at
this
point
the
merry
voice
of
clem
interrupted
as
he
came
hastily
in
still
bearing
the
burden
cyn
had
piled
upon
him
then
becoming
aware
of
miss
kling
presence
he
added
to
her
i
beg
pardon
for
my
abrupt
entrance
but
the
outer
door
being
open
i
made
bold
to
enter
then
explanatory
to
cyn
your
door
was
locked
as
also
was
mine
of
which
quimby
has
the
key
and
as
celeste
has
not
yet
been
able
to
part
with
him
there
i
have
been
standing
in
the
hall
like
patience
with
a
load
of
dandelions
we
were
having
such
an
interesting
conversation
cyn
answered
with
a
scornful
glance
in
miss
kling
direction
that
i
quite
forgot
you
and
the
lapse
of
time
clem
instantly
became
aware
of
something
amiss
in
the
atmosphere
and
glanced
around
inquiringly
miss
kling
immediately
enlightened
him
there
are
many
things
you
make
bold
to
do
young
man
she
said
putting
telegraph
apparatus
in
my
house
for
instance
ah
exclaimed
clem
comprehensively
yes
went
on
the
aggrieved
miss
kling
you
and
that
quimby
i
suppose
did
it
the
idea
originated
with
you
of
course
brains
enough
if
he
had
he
would
not
marry
celeste
and
miss
kling
sniffed
in
utter
contempt
of
poor
quimby
thanks
for
the
compliment
to
intellectual
abilities
said
clem
with
a
mischievous
look
then
advancing
towards
her
he
answered
in
his
own
frank
manly
way
and
so
you
have
found
us
out
but
i
trust
you
will
not
be
offended
with
us
it
is
after
all
a
trifle
and
we
said
nothing
about
it
merely
because
we
wished
to
have
a
little
mystery
of
our
own
it
was
as
the
newsboys
would
say
a
lark
of
ours
lark
repeated
miss
kling
drawing
herself
up
stiffly
young
man
you
will
oblige
me
by
not
using
slang
in
my
presence
pardon
me
said
clem
good
humoredly
and
in
regard
to
the
wire
blame
me
if
you
must
blame
any
one
as
you
say
it
was
all
my
doing
and
i
induced
miss
rogers
to
allow
the
wire
to
come
into
her
room
and
i
too
added
cyn
propitiatingly
for
nattie
sake
i
wished
to
learn
the
business
you
know
but
miss
kling
would
not
propitiate
miss
rogers
i
have
no
doubt
was
very
ready
to
be
induced
she
said
with
an
effort
at
sarcasm
i
have
heard
of
young
females
so
much
in
love
that
they
would
run
after
and
pursue
young
men
but
never
before
of
one
so
carried
away
and
so
lost
to
every
sense
of
decorum
as
to
be
obliged
to
have
a
wire
run
from
her
room
to
his
in
order
to
communicate
with
him
at
improper
times
this
accusation
and
ridiculous
as
it
was
yet
being
uttered
in
the
presence
of
clem
overwhelmed
poor
nattie
and
she
sank
on
the
lounge
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
at
which
clem
made
a
hasty
motion
and
then
as
if
aware
any
interference
of
his
would
only
make
matters
worse
checked
himself
but
cyn
came
to
the
front
with
striking
effect
you
ought
certainly
to
be
well
informed
on
the
subject
of
females
who
run
after
men
she
said
witheringly
if
one
may
believe
what
the
tor
what
fishblate
says
this
shot
told
miss
kling
turned
livid
with
rage
and
mortification
and
burst
into
a
terrific
spasm
of
sneezing
miss
rogers
she
said
wrathfully
as
soon
as
she
recovered
sufficiently
to
speak
your
conduct
and
that
of
your
associates
is
such
that
i
can
no
longer
allow
you
to
remain
on
my
premises
miss
kling
this
is
is
very
unjust
said
the
agitated
nattie
it
is
against
the
wishes
of
her
friends
that
she
has
remained
as
long
as
she
has
cried
cyn
hotly
miss
kling
your
proceedings
are
infamous
exclaimed
clem
not
able
to
contain
himself
longer
rather
afraid
to
draw
out
cyn
any
more
miss
kling
gladly
seized
this
opportunity
to
attack
clem
young
man
what
right
have
you
to
interfere
she
inquired
majestically
clem
bit
his
lip
sure
enough
what
right
had
he
he
glanced
at
nattie
where
she
sat
pale
and
disturbed
at
the
scene
that
threatened
to
end
seriously
for
her
and
then
obeying
a
sudden
impulse
seized
the
key
at
his
side
and
called
n
n
n
nattie
looked
up
quickly
and
while
miss
kling
who
supposed
he
was
wantonly
drumming
on
the
obnoxious
instrument
to
exasperate
her
vented
her
indignation
and
also
the
outraged
feelings
caused
by
the
inflicted
by
cyn
still
rankling
in
a
wrathful
homily
to
which
no
one
listened
for
cyn
was
watching
clem
curiously
he
wrote
rapidly
his
eyes
on
the
sounder
she
says
i
have
no
right
to
interfere
if
you
had
not
so
changed
towards
me
if
i
could
hope
you
loved
me
as
i
have
ever
loved
you
i
would
ask
you
to
give
me
the
right
and
let
me
put
this
pernicious
discredit
to
her
sex
on
the
other
side
of
that
door
as
these
words
in
dots
and
dashes
came
to
her
ears
nattie
forgetting
miss
kling
forgetting
everything
except
that
she
loved
clem
and
clem
declared
could
it
be
possible
that
he
loved
her
arose
hastily
with
a
quick
joy
suffusing
her
face
and
then
their
eyes
met
and
neither
words
or
dots
and
dashes
were
needed
love
more
potent
than
electricity
required
no
interpreter
and
that
most
powerful
of
all
magnets
drew
them
together
before
the
face
and
eyes
of
the
amazed
miss
kling
who
had
just
delivered
herself
of
a
sentence
intended
to
be
crushing
and
could
not
conceive
why
her
victim
should
suddenly
look
so
happy
over
it
he
advanced
to
nattie
side
clasped
her
hand
eagerly
and
tenderly
then
turning
to
miss
kling
said
while
cyn
surmising
the
truth
of
the
matter
embraced
herself
fervently
miss
kling
any
farther
observations
you
may
have
to
make
you
will
be
good
enough
to
say
to
me
hereafter
and
now
will
you
oblige
me
by
leaving
the
room
and
he
politely
held
open
the
door
what
gasped
miss
kling
hardly
believing
her
own
ears
i
can
not
allow
you
to
annoy
miss
rogers
the
lady
who
is
to
be
my
wife
clem
added
and
if
she
and
i
choose
to
have
twelve
telegraph
wires
we
will
let
me
bid
you
and
he
pointed
significantly
at
the
open
door
your
wife
miss
rogers
echoed
the
discomfited
miss
kling
and
glanced
at
the
blushing
nattie
at
cyn
undisguisedly
exultant
and
at
clem
determinedly
waiting
for
her
to
go
out
this
was
something
she
had
not
expected
and
it
took
her
aback
so
with
a
sneeze
she
drew
herself
up
gave
a
spiteful
parting
shot
well
she
has
worked
hard
enough
to
get
you
had
to
bring
the
telegraph
to
her
assistance
and
then
retreated
before
cyn
could
retaliate
with
the
torpedo
retreated
to
her
own
room
to
nurse
her
wrath
and
envy
and
to
dream
hopelessly
forever
more
of
that
other
self
never
to
come
nearer
than
now
the
discreet
cyn
comprehending
that
miss
kling
had
brought
about
that
crisis
and
that
something
had
been
said
on
the
wire
to
the
right
purpose
followed
her
out
and
left
them
alone
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
mention
that
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
behind
cyn
clem
took
nattie
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
it
was
an
inevitable
consequence
and
now
explain
why
you
have
treated
me
so
you
contrary
little
girl
he
queried
tenderly
i
thought
nattie
replied
raising
her
gray
eyes
from
which
the
shadows
were
all
gone
now
to
his
that
you
loved
cyn
you
did
he
said
surprised
and
reproachful
and
that
is
why
you
have
been
so
cold
and
distant
how
could
you
but
cyn
is
so
handsome
and
i
do
not
see
how
you
could
help
it
pleaded
nattie
in
of
course
she
is
handsome
talented
brilliant
fascinating
everything
that
is
nice
clem
answered
but
in
a
low
voice
cyn
was
not
my
little
girl
at
b
m
of
course
after
this
there
was
another
inevitable
consequence
and
then
clem
asked
and
did
you
care
because
you
imagined
you
naughty
jealous
girl
that
i
loved
cyn
yes
nattie
answered
blushing
but
honestly
i
was
very
unhappy
indeed
i
was
clem
i
think
i
loved
you
from
the
first
when
you
were
invisible
you
know
and
i
said
clem
should
have
given
myself
up
a
victim
to
despair
like
quimby
if
it
had
not
been
for
one
thing
jo
made
me
a
duplicate
of
that
picture
you
destroyed
and
the
fact
that
you
never
even
mentioned
the
cupid
overhead
gave
me
hope
and
his
own
roguish
look
was
in
his
eyes
as
he
saw
nattie
confusion
and
laughing
his
merry
laugh
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
i
beg
pardon
said
cyn
tapping
and
entering
after
a
cautious
interval
but
i
come
to
inquire
if
nat
i
mean
nathalie
still
thinks
as
she
did
an
hour
ago
that
clem
and
i
are
just
suited
to
each
other
nattie
laughed
and
blushed
you
see
i
set
my
heart
on
this
from
the
beginning
said
cyn
to
clem
not
thinking
it
necessary
to
define
to
what
this
referred
it
was
such
a
perfect
romance
you
know
and
she
has
been
frightening
me
by
declaring
that
you
were
in
love
with
me
and
was
so
positive
that
she
almost
made
me
believe
it
notwithstanding
my
natural
sagacity
as
i
certainly
should
have
been
replied
clem
gallantly
only
for
a
prior
attachment
you
see
i
loved
nattie
before
ever
i
saw
you
why
i
used
to
pass
the
most
of
my
time
when
at
x
n
in
wondering
what
she
was
like
and
wishing
i
was
as
near
her
as
i
am
now
for
instance
and
how
miserable
i
was
when
she
dropped
me
so
suddenly
and
how
happy
i
was
when
i
came
upon
her
at
that
blessed
feast
and
the
red
hair
was
all
explained
away
and
then
came
another
cross
on
the
circuit
of
my
true
love
and
had
it
not
been
for
that
betsey
kling
with
her
invectives
we
should
have
been
mixed
and
not
had
a
cue
now
exclaimed
cyn
i
declare
i
could
hug
her
but
betsey
kling
not
being
available
just
then
she
substituted
nattie
and
gave
her
a
most
emphatic
squeeze
it
was
your
shot
about
the
torpedo
that
finished
her
cyn
laughed
clem
it
effective
i
flatter
myself
cyn
confessed
and
that
reminds
me
you
must
not
stay
here
now
nat
you
know
so
i
have
seen
simonson
and
you
are
going
to
live
with
me
for
the
present
glancing
archly
at
her
until
that
book
is
written
for
instance
and
it
be
written
now
i
know
said
nattie
earnestly
her
eyes
shining
you
remember
what
you
once
said
cyn
i
see
now
you
were
right
yes
said
cyn
seriously
and
thank
heaven
that
it
was
love
and
not
disappointment
that
came
love
shall
not
come
in
vain
nattie
said
as
seriously
i
will
be
worthy
of
it
the
after
years
only
could
prove
her
words
but
in
clem
face
the
belief
in
them
was
written
as
plainly
as
if
those
future
possibilities
were
acknowledged
results
we
must
have
another
feast
to
celebrate
events
cyn
said
then
gayly
you
are
happy
my
romance
is
celeste
is
ecstatic
quimby
as
joyful
as
circumstances
permit
the
victim
of
mistake
to
be
jo
and
i
are
hopeful
of
future
fame
and
we
certainly
must
have
a
feast
with
plenty
of
dishes
this
time
laughed
clem
and
there
shall
be
no
more
crosses
on
the
wire
but
bless
my
heart
ejaculated
cyn
here
you
two
are
making
love
like
ordinary
mortals
at
this
nattie
hastily
withdrew
the
hand
clem
had
taken
quimby
and
celeste
for
instance
this
will
never
do
we
must
end
this
romance
of
dots
and
dashes
as
it
commenced
to
make
it
truly
love
true
enough
so
we
must
answered
clem
merrily
and
rising
he
went
to
the
key
with
his
eyes
looking
straight
into
nattie
and
wrote
something
that
made
her
blush
and
seize
his
hand
in
shy
and
unnecessary
alarm
saying
suppose
jo
should
be
over
in
your
room
he
might
be
able
to
read
it
very
well
replied
clem
as
he
laughed
and
kissed
her
regardless
of
the
spectator
i
am
quite
content
to
make
love
like
common
mortals
cyn
and
i
hope
my
darling
nattie
that
we
are
done
now
with
all
and
as
we
are
with
wired
love
henceforth
ours
shall
be
the
pure
unalloyed
article
genuine
love
and
nattie
but
wholly
glad
took
the
key
and
wrote
if
any
one
is
anxious
to
know
what
clem
wrote
when
nattie
stopped
him
here
it
is
my
little
darling

wife
