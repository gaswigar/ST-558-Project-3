i
the
patient
an
man
thought
the
nurse
made
a
mistake
in
keeping
both
of
the
windows
open
and
her
sprightly
disregard
of
his
protests
added
something
to
his
hatred
of
her
every
evening
he
told
her
that
anybody
with
ordinary
gumption
ought
to
realize
that
night
air
was
bad
for
the
human
frame
the
human
frame
wo
stand
everything
miss
perry
he
warned
her
resentfully
even
a
child
if
it
had
just
ordinary
gumption
ought
to
know
enough
not
to
let
the
night
air
blow
on
sick
people
yes
nor
well
people
either
out
of
the
night
air
no
matter
how
well
you
feel
that
what
my
mother
used
to
tell
me
when
i
was
a
boy
out
of
the
night
air
virgil
she
say
out
of
the
night
air
i
expect
probably
her
mother
told
her
the
same
thing
the
nurse
suggested
of
course
she
did
my
grandmother
oh
i
guess
your
grandmother
thought
so
adams
that
was
when
all
this
flat
central
country
was
swampish
and
had
been
drained
off
yet
i
guess
the
truth
must
been
the
swamp
mosquitoes
bit
people
and
gave
malaria
especially
before
they
began
to
put
screens
in
their
windows
well
we
got
screens
in
these
windows
and
no
mosquitoes
are
goin
to
bite
us
so
just
you
be
a
good
boy
and
rest
your
mind
and
go
to
sleep
like
you
need
sleep
he
said
likely
he
thought
the
night
air
worst
of
all
in
april
he
had
a
doubt
it
would
kill
him
he
declared
it
miraculous
what
the
human
frame
will
survive
he
admitted
on
the
last
evening
of
that
month
but
you
and
the
doctor
ought
to
both
be
taught
it
wo
stand
too
dang
much
you
poison
a
man
and
poison
and
poison
him
with
this
april
night
air
ca
poison
you
with
much
more
of
it
miss
perry
interrupted
him
indulgently
it
be
may
night
air
and
i
expect
that
be
a
lot
better
for
you
do
you
now
let
just
sober
down
and
be
a
good
boy
and
get
some
nice
sound
she
gave
him
his
medicine
and
having
set
the
glass
upon
the
center
table
returned
to
her
cot
where
after
a
still
interval
she
snored
faintly
upon
this
his
expression
became
that
of
a
man
goaded
out
of
overpowering
weariness
into
irony
sleep
oh
certainly
thank
you
however
he
did
sleep
intermittently
drowsed
between
times
and
even
dreamed
but
forgetting
his
dreams
before
he
opened
his
eyes
and
having
some
part
of
him
all
the
while
aware
of
his
discomfort
he
believed
as
usual
that
he
lay
awake
the
whole
night
long
he
was
conscious
of
the
city
as
of
some
single
great
creature
resting
fitfully
in
the
dark
outside
his
windows
it
lay
all
round
about
in
the
damp
cover
of
its
night
cloud
of
smoke
and
tried
to
keep
quiet
for
a
few
hours
after
midnight
but
was
too
powerful
a
growing
thing
ever
to
lie
altogether
still
even
while
it
strove
to
sleep
it
muttered
with
digestions
of
the
day
before
and
these
already
merged
with
rumblings
of
the
morrow
owl
cars
bringing
in
last
passengers
over
distant
now
and
then
howled
on
a
curve
faraway
metallic
stirrings
could
be
heard
from
factories
in
the
sooty
suburbs
on
the
plain
outside
the
city
east
west
and
south
chugged
and
snorted
on
sidings
and
everywhere
in
the
air
there
seemed
to
be
a
faint
voluminous
hum
as
of
innumerable
wires
trembling
overhead
to
vibration
of
machinery
underground
in
his
youth
adams
might
have
been
less
resentful
of
sounds
such
as
these
when
they
interfered
with
his
night
sleep
even
during
an
illness
he
might
have
taken
some
pride
in
them
as
proof
of
his
citizenship
in
a
live
town
but
at
he
merely
hated
them
because
they
kept
him
awake
they
pressed
on
his
nerves
as
he
put
it
and
so
did
almost
everything
else
for
that
matter
he
heard
the
drive
into
the
beneath
his
windows
and
stop
at
each
house
the
milkman
carried
his
jars
round
to
the
back
porch
while
the
horse
moved
slowly
ahead
to
the
gate
of
the
next
customer
and
waited
there
he
gone
into
pollocks
adams
thought
following
this
progress
i
hope
it
sour
on
before
breakfast
delivered
the
andersons
now
he
getting
out
ours
listen
to
the
darn
brute
what
he
care
who
wants
to
sleep
his
complaint
was
of
the
horse
who
casually
shifted
weight
with
a
clink
of
steel
shoes
on
the
worn
brick
pavement
of
the
street
and
then
heartily
shook
himself
in
his
harness
perhaps
to
dislodge
a
fly
far
ahead
of
its
season
light
had
just
filmed
the
windows
and
with
that
the
first
sparrow
woke
chirped
instantly
and
roused
neighbours
in
the
trees
of
the
small
yard
including
a
robin
vociferations
began
irregularly
but
were
soon
unanimous
sleep
dang
likely
now
ai
it
night
sounds
were
becoming
day
sounds
the
hooting
of
seemed
brisker
than
an
hour
ago
in
the
dark
a
cheerful
whistler
passed
the
house
even
more
careless
of
sleepers
than
the
milkman
horse
had
been
then
a
group
of
coloured
workmen
came
by
and
although
it
was
impossible
to
be
sure
whether
they
were
homeward
bound
from
or
on
their
way
to
at
least
it
was
certain
that
they
were
jocose
loose
aboriginal
laughter
preceded
them
afar
and
beat
on
the
air
long
after
they
had
gone
by
the
shielded
from
his
eyes
by
a
newspaper
propped
against
a
still
showed
a
thin
glimmering
that
had
grown
offensive
to
adams
in
his
wandering
and
enfeebled
thoughts
which
were
much
more
often
imaginings
than
reasonings
the
attempt
of
the
to
resist
the
dawn
reminded
him
of
something
unpleasant
though
he
could
not
discover
just
what
the
unpleasant
thing
was
here
was
a
puzzle
that
irritated
him
the
more
because
he
could
not
solve
it
yet
always
seemed
just
on
the
point
of
a
solution
however
he
may
have
lost
nothing
cheerful
by
remaining
in
the
dark
upon
the
matter
for
if
he
had
been
a
little
sharper
in
this
introspection
he
might
have
concluded
that
the
squalor
of
the
in
its
seeming
effort
to
show
against
the
forerunning
of
the
sun
itself
had
stimulated
some
perception
within
him
to
sketch
the
painful
little
synopsis
of
an
autobiography
in
spite
of
noises
without
he
drowsed
again
not
knowing
that
he
did
and
when
he
opened
his
eyes
the
nurse
was
just
rising
from
her
cot
he
took
no
pleasure
in
the
sight
it
may
be
said
she
exhibited
to
him
a
face
mismodelled
by
sleep
and
set
like
a
clay
face
left
on
its
cheek
in
a
hot
and
dry
studio
she
was
still
only
in
part
awake
however
and
by
the
time
she
had
extinguished
the
and
given
her
patient
his
tonic
she
had
recovered
enough
plasticity
well
is
that
grand
we
had
another
good
night
she
said
as
she
departed
to
dress
in
the
bathroom
yes
you
had
another
he
retorted
though
not
until
after
she
had
closed
the
door
presently
he
heard
his
daughter
moving
about
in
her
room
across
the
narrow
hall
and
so
knew
that
she
had
risen
he
hoped
she
would
come
in
to
see
him
soon
for
she
was
the
one
thing
that
did
press
on
his
nerves
he
felt
though
the
thought
of
her
hurt
him
as
indeed
every
thought
hurt
him
but
it
was
his
wife
who
came
first
she
wore
a
lank
cotton
wrapper
and
a
crescent
of
gray
hair
escaped
to
one
temple
from
beneath
the
handkerchief
she
had
worn
upon
her
head
for
the
night
and
still
retained
but
she
did
everything
possible
to
make
her
expression
cheering
oh
you
better
again
i
can
see
that
as
soon
as
i
look
at
you
she
said
miss
perry
tells
me
you
had
another
splendid
he
made
a
sound
of
irony
which
seemed
to
dispose
unfavourably
of
miss
perry
and
then
in
order
to
be
more
certainly
intelligible
he
added
she
slept
well
as
usual
but
his
wife
smile
persisted
it
a
good
sign
to
be
cross
it
means
you
practically
convalescent
right
oh
i
am
am
i
no
doubt
in
the
world
she
exclaimed
why
you
practically
a
well
man
virgil
all
except
getting
your
strength
back
of
course
and
that
is
going
to
take
long
you
be
right
on
your
feet
in
a
couple
of
weeks
from
oh
i
will
of
course
you
will
she
laughed
briskly
and
going
to
the
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
moved
his
glass
of
medicine
an
inch
or
two
turned
a
book
over
so
that
it
lay
upon
its
other
side
and
for
a
few
moments
occupied
herself
with
similar
futilities
having
taken
on
the
air
of
a
person
who
makes
things
neat
though
she
produced
no
such
actual
effect
upon
them
of
course
you
will
she
repeated
absently
you
be
as
strong
as
you
ever
were
maybe
she
paused
for
a
moment
not
looking
at
him
then
added
cheerfully
so
that
you
can
fly
around
and
find
something
really
good
to
get
something
important
between
them
came
near
the
surface
here
for
though
she
spoke
with
what
seemed
but
a
casual
cheerfulness
there
was
a
little
betraying
break
in
her
voice
a
trembling
just
perceptible
in
the
utterance
of
the
final
word
and
she
still
kept
up
the
affectation
of
being
helpfully
preoccupied
with
the
table
and
did
not
look
at
her
husband
perhaps
because
they
had
been
married
so
many
years
that
without
looking
she
knew
just
what
his
expression
would
be
and
preferred
to
avoid
the
actual
sight
of
it
as
long
as
possible
meanwhile
he
stared
hard
at
her
his
lips
beginning
to
move
with
little
distortions
not
lacking
in
the
pathos
of
a
sick
man
agitation
so
that
it
he
said
that
what
you
hinting
adams
looked
surprised
and
indulgent
why
i
not
doing
any
hinting
what
did
you
say
about
my
finding
good
to
get
into
he
asked
sharply
do
you
call
that
hinting
adams
turned
toward
him
now
she
came
to
the
bedside
and
would
have
taken
his
hand
but
he
quickly
moved
it
away
from
her
you
must
let
yourself
get
nervous
she
said
but
of
course
when
you
get
well
there
only
one
thing
to
do
you
must
go
back
to
that
old
hole
hole
that
what
you
call
it
is
it
in
spite
of
his
weakness
anger
made
his
voice
strident
and
upon
this
stimulation
she
spoke
more
urgently
you
just
must
go
back
to
it
virgil
it
not
fair
to
any
of
us
and
you
know
it
do
tell
me
what
i
know
please
she
clasped
her
hands
suddenly
carrying
her
urgency
to
plaintive
entreaty
virgil
you
wo
go
back
to
that
hole
that
a
nice
word
to
use
to
me
he
said
call
a
man
business
a
hole
virgil
if
you
do
owe
it
to
me
to
look
for
something
different
do
you
owe
it
to
your
children
do
tell
me
you
wo
do
what
we
all
want
you
to
and
what
you
know
in
your
heart
you
ought
to
and
if
you
have
got
into
one
of
your
stubborn
fits
and
are
bound
to
go
back
there
for
no
other
reason
except
to
have
your
own
way
do
tell
me
so
for
i
ca
bear
it
he
looked
up
at
her
fiercely
you
got
a
fine
way
to
cure
a
sick
man
he
said
but
she
had
concluded
her
appeal
for
that
time
and
instead
of
making
any
more
words
in
the
matter
let
him
see
that
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
shook
her
head
and
left
the
room
alone
he
lay
breathing
rapidly
his
emaciated
chest
proving
itself
equal
to
the
demands
his
emotion
put
upon
it
fine
he
repeated
with
husky
indignation
fine
way
to
cure
a
sick
man
fine
then
after
a
silence
he
gave
forth
whispering
sounds
as
of
laughter
his
expression
the
while
remaining
sore
and
far
from
humour
and
give
us
our
daily
bread
he
added
meaning
that
his
wife
little
performance
was
no
novelty
chapter
ii
in
fact
the
agitation
of
adams
was
genuine
but
so
well
under
her
control
that
its
traces
vanished
during
the
three
short
steps
she
took
to
cross
the
narrow
hall
between
her
husband
door
and
the
one
opposite
her
expression
was
rather
than
pathetic
as
she
entered
the
pretty
room
where
her
daughter
half
dressed
sat
before
a
and
played
with
the
reflections
of
a
mirror
framed
in
blue
enamel
that
is
just
before
the
moment
of
her
mother
entrance
alice
had
been
playing
with
the
reflections
posturing
her
arms
and
her
expressions
clasping
her
hands
behind
her
neck
and
tilting
back
her
head
to
foreshorten
the
face
in
a
tableau
conceived
to
represent
sauciness
then
one
of
smiling
weariness
then
one
of
scornful
toleration
and
all
very
piquant
but
as
the
door
opened
she
hurriedly
resumed
the
practical
and
occupied
her
hands
in
the
arrangement
of
her
plentiful
brownish
hair
they
were
pretty
hands
of
a
shapeliness
delicate
and
fine
the
best
things
she
got
a
girl
friend
said
of
them
and
meant
to
include
alice
mind
and
character
in
the
implied
list
of
possessions
surpassed
by
the
notable
hands
however
that
may
have
been
the
rest
of
her
was
well
enough
she
was
often
called
a
right
pretty
girl
temperate
praise
meaning
a
girl
rather
pretty
than
otherwise
and
this
she
deserved
to
say
the
least
even
in
repose
she
deserved
it
though
repose
was
anything
but
her
habit
being
seldom
seen
upon
her
except
at
home
on
exhibition
she
led
a
life
of
gestures
the
unkind
said
to
make
her
lovely
hands
more
memorable
but
all
of
her
usually
accompanied
the
gestures
of
the
hands
the
shoulders
ever
giving
them
their
impulses
first
and
even
her
feet
being
called
upon
at
the
same
time
for
eloquence
so
much
liveliness
took
proper
place
as
only
accessory
to
that
of
the
face
where
her
vivacity
reached
its
climax
and
it
was
unfortunate
that
an
ungifted
young
man
new
in
the
town
should
have
attempted
to
define
the
effect
upon
him
of
all
this
generosity
of
emphasis
he
said
that
the
way
she
used
her
cute
hazel
eyes
and
the
wonderful
glow
of
her
facial
expression
gave
her
a
mighty
spiritual
his
actual
rendition
of
the
word
was
spirichul
but
it
was
not
his
pronunciation
that
embalmed
this
outburst
in
the
perennial
laughter
of
alice
girl
friends
they
made
the
misfortune
far
less
his
than
hers
her
mother
comforted
her
too
heartily
insisting
that
alice
had
plenty
enough
spiritual
qualities
certainly
more
than
possessed
by
the
other
girls
who
flung
the
phrase
at
her
wooden
things
jealous
of
everything
they
were
incapable
of
themselves
and
then
alice
getting
more
championship
than
she
sought
grew
uneasy
lest
adams
should
repeat
such
defenses
outside
the
family
and
adams
ended
by
weeping
because
the
daughter
so
distrusted
her
intelligence
alice
frequently
thought
it
necessary
to
instruct
her
mother
her
morning
greeting
was
an
instruction
or
rather
it
was
an
admonition
in
the
style
of
an
entreaty
the
more
petulant
as
alice
thought
that
adams
might
have
had
a
glimpse
of
the
posturings
to
the
mirror
this
was
a
needless
worry
the
mother
had
caught
a
thousand
such
glimpses
with
alice
unaware
and
she
thought
nothing
of
the
one
just
flitted
for
heaven
sake
mama
come
clear
inside
the
room
and
shut
the
door
please
do
leave
it
open
for
everybody
to
look
at
me
there
is
anybody
to
see
you
adams
explained
obeying
miss
perry
gone
downstairs
and
mama
i
heard
you
in
papa
room
alice
said
not
dropping
the
note
of
complaint
i
could
hear
both
of
you
and
i
do
think
you
ought
to
get
poor
old
papa
so
upset
not
in
his
present
condition
adams
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
better
all
the
time
she
said
not
disturbed
he
almost
well
the
doctor
says
so
and
miss
perry
says
so
and
if
we
do
get
him
into
the
right
frame
of
mind
now
we
never
will
the
first
day
he
outdoors
he
go
back
to
that
old
hole
you
see
and
if
he
once
does
that
he
settle
down
there
and
it
be
too
late
and
we
never
get
him
well
anyhow
i
think
you
could
use
a
little
more
tact
with
i
do
try
to
the
mother
sighed
it
never
was
much
use
with
him
i
do
think
you
understand
him
as
well
as
i
do
there
one
thing
i
do
understand
about
either
of
you
alice
returned
crisply
before
people
get
married
they
can
do
anything
they
want
to
with
each
other
why
ca
they
do
the
same
thing
after
married
when
you
and
papa
were
young
people
and
engaged
he
have
done
anything
you
wanted
him
to
that
must
have
been
because
you
knew
how
to
manage
him
then
why
ca
you
go
at
him
the
same
way
now
adams
sighed
again
and
laughed
a
little
making
no
other
response
but
alice
persisted
well
why
ca
you
why
ca
you
ask
him
to
do
things
the
way
you
used
to
ask
him
when
you
were
just
in
love
with
each
other
why
do
you
anyhow
try
it
mama
instead
of
at
him
at
him
alice
adams
said
with
a
pathos
somewhat
emphasized
is
that
how
my
trying
to
do
what
i
can
for
you
strikes
you
never
mind
that
it
nothing
to
hurt
your
alice
disposed
of
the
pathos
briskly
why
do
you
answer
my
question
what
the
matter
with
using
a
little
more
tact
on
papa
why
ca
you
treat
him
the
way
you
probably
did
when
you
were
young
people
before
you
were
married
i
never
have
understood
why
people
ca
do
perhaps
you
will
understand
some
day
her
mother
said
gently
maybe
you
will
when
you
been
married
you
keep
evading
why
do
you
answer
my
question
right
straight
out
there
are
questions
you
ca
answer
to
young
people
you
mean
because
we
too
young
to
understand
the
answer
i
do
see
that
at
all
at
a
girl
supposed
to
have
some
intelligence
is
she
and
intelligence
is
the
ability
to
understand
is
it
why
do
i
have
to
wait
till
i
lived
with
a
man
years
to
understand
why
you
ca
be
tactful
with
papa
you
may
understand
some
things
before
that
adams
said
tremulously
you
may
understand
how
you
hurt
me
sometimes
youth
ca
know
everything
by
being
intelligent
and
by
the
time
you
could
understand
the
answer
you
asking
for
you
know
it
and
would
need
to
ask
you
do
understand
your
father
alice
you
do
know
what
it
takes
to
change
him
when
he
made
up
his
mind
to
be
alice
rose
and
began
to
get
herself
into
a
skirt
well
i
do
think
making
scenes
ever
changes
anybody
she
grumbled
i
think
a
little
jolly
persuasion
goes
twice
as
far
little
jolly
persuasion
her
mother
turned
the
echo
of
this
phrase
into
an
ironic
lament
yes
there
was
a
time
when
i
thought
that
too
it
did
work
that
perhaps
you
left
the
part
of
it
out
for
the
second
time
that
morning
it
was
now
a
little
after
seven
tears
seemed
about
to
offer
their
solace
to
adams
i
might
have
expected
you
to
say
that
alice
you
never
do
miss
a
chance
she
said
gently
it
seems
queer
you
do
some
time
miss
just
one
chance
but
alice
progressing
with
her
toilet
appeared
to
be
little
concerned
oh
well
i
think
there
are
better
ways
of
managing
a
man
than
just
hammering
at
adams
uttered
a
little
cry
of
pain
alice
if
you
left
it
entirely
to
me
her
daughter
went
on
briskly
i
believe
papa
already
be
willing
to
do
anything
we
want
him
that
it
tell
me
i
spoil
everything
well
i
wo
interfere
from
now
on
you
can
be
sure
of
please
do
talk
like
that
alice
said
quickly
i
old
enough
to
realize
that
papa
may
need
pressure
of
all
sorts
i
only
think
it
makes
him
more
obstinate
to
get
him
cross
you
probably
do
understand
him
better
but
that
one
thing
i
found
out
and
you
have
there
she
gave
her
mother
a
friendly
tap
on
the
shoulder
and
went
to
the
door
i
hop
in
and
say
hello
to
him
as
she
went
she
continued
the
fastening
of
her
blouse
and
appeared
in
her
father
room
with
one
hand
still
thus
engaged
but
she
patted
his
forehead
with
the
other
poor
old
she
said
gaily
every
time
he
better
somebody
talks
him
into
getting
so
mad
he
has
a
relapse
it
a
shame
her
father
eyes
beneath
their
melancholy
brows
looked
up
at
her
wistfully
i
suppose
you
heard
your
mother
going
for
me
he
said
i
heard
you
going
for
her
too
alice
laughed
what
was
it
all
about
oh
the
same
danged
old
story
you
mean
she
wants
you
to
try
something
new
when
you
get
well
alice
asked
with
cheerful
innocence
so
we
could
all
have
a
lot
more
money
at
this
his
sorrowful
forehead
was
more
sorrowful
than
ever
the
deep
horizontal
lines
moved
upward
to
a
pattern
of
suffering
so
familiar
to
his
daughter
that
it
meant
nothing
to
her
but
he
spoke
quietly
yes
so
we
would
have
any
money
at
all
most
oh
no
she
laughed
and
finishing
with
her
blouse
patted
his
cheeks
with
both
hands
just
think
how
many
grand
openings
there
must
be
for
a
man
that
knows
as
much
as
you
do
i
always
did
believe
you
could
get
rich
if
you
only
cared
to
but
upon
his
forehead
the
painful
pattern
still
deepened
do
you
think
we
always
had
enough
the
way
things
are
alice
not
the
way
things
are
she
patted
his
cheeks
again
laughed
again
it
used
to
be
enough
maybe
anyway
we
did
skimp
along
on
it
but
the
way
things
are
now
i
expect
mama
really
pretty
practical
in
her
ideas
though
i
think
it
a
shame
for
her
to
bother
you
about
it
while
so
weak
do
you
worry
about
it
though
just
think
about
other
things
till
you
get
you
know
he
said
you
know
it
is
exactly
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
a
man
of
my
age
to
find
these
grand
openings
you
speak
of
and
when
you
passed
from
fifty
to
sixty
you
apt
to
see
some
risk
in
giving
up
what
you
know
how
to
do
and
trying
something
my
what
a
frown
she
cried
blithely
did
i
tell
you
to
stop
thinking
about
it
till
you
get
all
well
she
bent
over
him
giving
him
a
gay
little
kiss
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
there
i
must
run
to
breakfast
cheer
up
now
au
and
with
her
pretty
hand
she
waved
further
encouragement
from
the
closing
door
as
she
departed
lightsomely
descending
the
narrow
stairway
she
whistled
as
she
went
her
fingers
drumming
time
on
the
rail
and
still
whistling
she
came
into
the
where
her
mother
and
her
brother
were
already
at
the
table
the
brother
a
thin
and
sallow
boy
of
twenty
greeted
her
without
much
approval
as
she
took
her
place
nothing
seems
to
trouble
you
he
said
no
nothing
much
she
made
airy
response
what
troubling
yourself
walter
do
let
that
worry
you
he
returned
seeming
to
consider
this
to
be
repartee
of
an
effective
sort
for
he
furnished
a
short
laugh
to
go
with
it
and
turned
to
his
coffee
with
the
manner
of
one
who
has
satisfactorily
closed
an
episode
walter
always
seems
to
have
so
many
secrets
alice
said
studying
him
shrewdly
but
with
a
friendly
enough
amusement
in
her
scrutiny
everything
he
does
or
says
seems
to
be
acted
for
the
benefit
of
some
mysterious
audience
inside
himself
and
he
always
gets
its
applause
take
what
he
said
just
now
he
seems
to
think
it
means
something
but
if
it
does
why
that
just
another
secret
between
him
and
the
secret
audience
inside
of
him
we
do
really
know
anything
about
walter
at
all
do
we
mama
walter
laughed
again
in
a
manner
that
sustained
her
theory
well
enough
then
after
finishing
his
coffee
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
flattened
packet
in
glazed
blue
paper
extracted
with
stained
fingers
a
bent
and
wrinkled
little
cigarette
lighted
it
hitched
up
his
belted
trousers
with
the
air
of
a
person
who
turns
from
trifles
to
things
better
worth
his
attention
and
left
the
room
alice
laughed
as
the
door
closed
he
all
secrets
she
said
you
think
you
really
ought
to
know
more
about
him
mama
i
sure
he
a
good
boy
adams
returned
thoughtfully
been
very
brave
about
not
being
able
to
have
the
advantages
that
are
enjoyed
by
the
boys
he
grown
up
with
i
never
heard
a
word
of
complaint
from
about
his
not
being
sent
to
college
alice
cried
i
should
think
you
would
he
did
even
have
enough
ambition
to
finish
high
school
adams
sighed
it
seemed
to
me
walter
lost
his
ambition
when
nearly
all
the
boys
he
grown
up
with
went
to
eastern
schools
to
prepare
for
college
and
we
could
afford
to
send
him
if
only
your
father
would
have
listened
alice
interrupted
what
nonsense
walter
hated
books
and
studying
and
athletics
too
for
that
matter
he
does
care
for
anything
nice
that
i
ever
heard
of
what
do
you
suppose
he
does
like
mama
he
must
like
something
or
other
somewhere
but
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
what
does
he
do
with
his
time
why
the
poor
boy
at
lamb
and
company
all
day
he
does
get
through
until
five
in
the
afternoon
he
does
have
much
well
we
never
have
dinner
until
about
seven
and
he
always
late
for
dinner
and
goes
out
heaven
knows
where
right
afterward
alice
shook
her
head
he
used
to
go
with
our
friends
boys
but
i
do
think
he
does
why
how
could
he
adams
protested
that
is
his
fault
poor
child
the
boys
he
knew
when
he
was
younger
are
nearly
all
away
at
yes
but
he
does
see
anything
of
when
they
here
at
or
vacation
none
of
come
to
the
house
any
i
suppose
he
made
other
friends
it
natural
for
him
to
want
companions
at
his
yes
alice
said
with
disapproving
emphasis
but
who
are
they
got
an
idea
he
plays
pool
at
some
rough
place
oh
no
i
sure
he
a
steady
boy
adams
protested
but
her
tone
was
not
that
of
thoroughgoing
conviction
and
she
added
life
might
be
a
very
different
thing
for
him
if
only
your
father
can
be
brought
to
see
never
mind
mama
it
is
me
that
has
to
be
convinced
you
know
and
we
can
do
a
lot
more
with
papa
if
we
just
let
him
alone
about
it
for
a
day
or
two
promise
me
you
wo
say
any
more
to
him
until
well
until
he
able
to
come
downstairs
to
table
will
you
adams
bit
her
lip
which
had
begun
to
tremble
i
think
you
can
trust
me
to
know
a
few
things
alice
she
said
i
a
little
older
than
you
you
that
a
good
girl
alice
jumped
up
laughing
do
forget
it
the
same
as
a
promise
and
do
just
cheer
him
up
a
little
i
say
to
him
before
i
go
where
are
you
going
oh
i
got
lots
to
do
i
thought
i
run
out
to
mildred
to
see
what
she
going
to
wear
and
then
i
want
to
go
down
and
buy
a
yard
of
chiffon
and
some
narrow
ribbon
to
make
new
bows
for
my
slippers
you
have
to
give
me
some
money
if
he
give
it
to
me
her
mother
lamented
as
they
went
toward
the
front
stairs
together
but
an
hour
later
she
came
into
alice
room
with
a
bill
in
her
hand
he
has
some
money
in
his
bureau
drawer
she
said
he
finally
told
me
where
it
there
were
traces
of
emotion
in
her
voice
and
alice
looking
shrewdly
at
her
saw
moisture
in
her
eyes
mama
she
cried
you
did
do
what
you
promised
me
you
would
did
you
not
before
miss
perry
miss
perry
getting
him
some
broth
adams
returned
calmly
besides
you
mistaken
in
saying
i
promised
you
anything
i
said
i
thought
you
could
trust
me
to
know
what
is
so
you
did
bring
it
up
again
and
alice
swung
away
from
her
strode
to
her
father
door
flung
it
open
went
to
him
and
put
a
light
hand
soothingly
over
his
unrelaxed
forehead
poor
old
papa
she
said
it
a
shame
how
everybody
wants
to
trouble
him
he
sha
be
bothered
any
more
at
all
he
does
need
to
have
everybody
telling
him
how
to
get
away
from
that
old
hole
he
worked
in
so
long
and
begin
to
make
us
all
nice
and
rich
he
knows
how
thereupon
she
kissed
him
a
consoling
and
made
another
gay
departure
the
charming
hand
again
fluttering
like
a
white
butterfly
in
the
shadow
of
the
closing
door
chapter
iii
adams
had
remained
in
alice
room
but
her
mood
seemed
to
have
changed
during
her
daughter
little
more
than
momentary
absence
what
did
he
say
she
asked
quickly
and
her
tone
was
hopeful
alice
repeated
impatiently
why
nothing
i
did
let
him
really
mama
i
think
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
would
be
to
just
keep
out
of
his
room
because
i
do
believe
you
can
go
in
there
and
not
talk
to
him
about
it
and
if
you
do
talk
we
never
get
him
to
do
the
right
thing
never
the
mother
response
was
a
grieving
silence
she
turned
from
her
daughter
and
walked
to
the
door
now
for
goodness
sake
alice
cried
do
go
making
tragedy
out
of
my
offering
you
a
little
practical
advice
i
not
adams
gulped
halting
i
just
just
going
to
dust
the
downstairs
and
with
her
face
still
averted
she
went
out
into
the
little
hallway
closing
the
door
behind
her
a
moment
later
she
could
be
heard
descending
the
stairs
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
carrying
somehow
an
effect
of
resignation
alice
listened
sighed
and
breathing
the
words
oh
murder
turned
to
cheerier
matters
she
put
on
a
little
turban
with
a
dim
gold
band
round
it
and
then
having
shrouded
the
turban
in
a
white
veil
which
she
kept
pushed
up
above
her
forehead
she
got
herself
into
a
tan
coat
of
soft
cloth
fashioned
with
rakish
severity
after
that
having
studied
herself
gravely
in
a
long
glass
she
took
from
one
of
the
drawers
of
her
a
black
leather
cornered
in
silver
filigree
but
found
it
empty
she
opened
another
drawer
wherein
were
two
white
pasteboard
boxes
of
cards
the
one
set
showing
simply
miss
adams
the
other
engraved
in
gothic
characters
miss
alys
tuttle
the
latter
belonged
to
alice
alys
period
most
girls
go
through
it
and
alice
must
have
felt
that
she
had
graduated
for
after
frowning
thoughtfully
at
the
exhibit
this
morning
she
took
the
box
with
its
contents
and
let
the
white
shower
fall
from
her
fingers
into
the
beside
her
small
desk
she
replenished
the
from
the
miss
adams
box
then
having
found
a
pair
of
fresh
white
gloves
she
tucked
an
malacca
under
her
arm
and
set
forth
she
went
down
the
stairs
buttoning
her
gloves
and
still
wearing
the
frown
with
which
she
had
put
alys
finally
out
of
her
life
she
descended
slowly
and
paused
on
the
lowest
step
looking
about
her
with
an
expression
that
needed
but
a
slight
deepening
to
betoken
bitterness
its
connection
with
her
dropping
alys
forever
was
slight
however
the
small
frame
house
about
fifteen
years
old
was
already
inclining
to
become
a
new
colonial
relic
the
adamses
had
built
it
moving
into
it
from
the
queen
anne
house
they
had
rented
until
they
took
this
step
in
fashion
but
fifteen
years
is
a
long
time
to
stand
still
in
the
midland
country
even
for
a
house
and
this
one
was
lightly
made
though
the
adamses
had
not
realized
how
flimsily
until
they
had
lived
in
it
for
some
time
solid
compact
and
convenient
were
the
instructions
to
the
architect
and
he
had
made
it
compact
successfully
alice
pausing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
was
at
the
same
time
fairly
in
the
for
the
only
separation
between
the
living
room
and
the
hall
was
a
demarcation
suggested
to
willing
imaginations
by
a
pair
of
wooden
columns
painted
white
these
columns
pine
under
the
paint
were
bruised
and
chipped
at
the
base
one
of
them
showed
a
crack
that
threatened
to
become
a
split
the
floor
had
become
uneven
and
in
a
corner
the
walls
apparently
failed
of
solidity
where
the
had
declined
to
accompany
some
staggerings
of
the
plaster
beneath
it
the
furniture
was
in
great
part
an
accumulation
begun
with
the
wedding
gifts
though
some
of
it
was
older
two
large
patent
and
a
footstool
having
belonged
to
adams
mother
in
the
days
of
hard
brown
plush
and
veneer
for
decoration
there
were
pictures
and
vases
adams
had
always
been
fond
of
vases
she
said
and
every
year
her
husband
christmas
present
to
her
was
a
vase
of
one
sort
or
another
whatever
the
clerk
showed
him
marked
at
about
twelve
or
fourteen
dollars
the
pictures
were
some
of
them
etchings
framed
in
gilt
rheims
canterbury
schooners
grouped
against
a
wharf
and
alice
could
remember
how
in
her
childhood
her
father
sometimes
pointed
out
the
watery
reflections
in
this
last
as
very
fine
but
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
shown
interest
in
such
things
or
in
anything
much
as
she
thought
other
pictures
were
two
in
baroque
frames
one
being
the
amalfi
monk
on
a
pergola
wall
while
the
second
was
a
display
of
iris
blossoms
painted
by
alice
herself
at
fourteen
as
a
birthday
gift
to
her
mother
alice
glance
paused
upon
it
now
with
no
great
pride
but
showed
more
approval
of
an
enormous
photograph
of
the
colosseum
this
she
thought
of
as
the
only
good
thing
in
the
room
it
possessed
and
bestowed
distinction
she
felt
and
she
did
not
regret
having
won
her
struggle
to
get
it
hung
in
its
conspicuous
place
of
honour
over
the
mantelpiece
formerly
that
place
had
been
held
for
years
by
a
an
accurate
representation
of
the
suspension
bridge
at
niagara
falls
it
was
almost
as
large
as
its
successor
the
colosseum
and
it
had
been
presented
to
adams
by
colleagues
in
his
department
at
lamb
and
company
adams
had
shown
some
feeling
when
alice
began
to
urge
its
removal
to
obscurity
in
the
upstairs
hall
he
even
resisted
for
several
days
after
she
had
the
colosseum
charged
to
him
framed
in
oak
and
sent
to
the
house
she
cheered
him
up
of
course
when
he
gave
way
and
her
heart
never
misgave
her
that
there
might
be
a
doubt
which
of
the
two
pictures
was
the
more
dismaying
over
the
pictures
the
vases
the
old
brown
plush
and
the
stool
over
the
three
gilt
chairs
over
the
new
easy
chair
and
the
gray
velure
sofa
over
everything
everywhere
was
the
familiar
coating
of
smoke
grime
it
had
worked
into
every
fibre
of
the
lace
curtains
dingying
them
to
an
unpleasant
gray
it
lay
on
the
and
it
dimmed
the
glass
panes
it
covered
the
walls
covered
the
ceiling
and
was
smeared
darker
and
thicker
in
all
corners
yet
here
was
no
fault
of
housewifery
the
curse
could
not
be
lifted
as
the
ingrained
smudges
permanent
on
the
once
white
woodwork
proved
the
grime
was
perpetually
renewed
scrubbing
only
ground
it
in
this
particular
ugliness
was
small
part
of
alice
discontent
for
though
the
coating
grew
a
little
deeper
each
year
she
was
used
to
it
moreover
she
knew
that
she
was
not
likely
to
find
anything
better
in
a
thousand
miles
so
long
as
she
kept
to
cities
and
that
none
of
her
friends
however
opulent
had
any
advantage
of
her
here
indeed
throughout
all
the
great
country
people
who
consider
themselves
comparatively
poor
may
find
this
consolation
cleanliness
has
been
added
to
the
virtues
and
beatitudes
that
money
can
not
buy
alice
brightened
a
little
as
she
went
forward
to
the
front
door
and
she
brightened
more
when
the
spring
breeze
met
her
there
then
all
depression
left
her
as
she
walked
down
the
short
brick
path
to
the
sidewalk
looked
up
and
down
the
street
and
saw
how
bravely
the
maple
in
spite
of
the
black
powder
they
breathed
were
flinging
out
their
thousands
of
young
green
particles
overhead
she
turned
north
treading
the
new
little
shadows
on
the
pavement
briskly
and
having
finished
buttoning
her
gloves
swung
down
her
malacca
stick
from
under
her
arm
to
let
it
tap
a
more
leisurely
accompaniment
to
her
quick
short
step
she
had
to
step
quickly
if
she
was
to
get
anywhere
for
the
closeness
of
her
skirt
in
spite
of
its
little
length
permitted
no
natural
stride
but
she
was
pleased
to
be
impeded
these
brevities
forming
part
of
her
show
of
fashion
other
pedestrians
found
them
not
without
charm
though
approval
may
have
been
lacking
here
and
there
and
at
the
first
crossing
alice
suffered
what
she
might
have
accounted
an
actual
injury
had
she
allowed
herself
to
be
so
sensitive
an
elderly
woman
in
fussy
black
silk
stood
there
waiting
for
a
streetcar
she
was
all
of
a
globular
modelling
with
a
face
patterned
like
a
peach
and
that
the
approaching
gracefulness
was
uncongenial
she
naively
made
too
evident
her
round
wan
eyes
seemed
roused
to
bitter
life
as
they
rose
from
the
curved
high
heels
of
the
buckled
slippers
to
the
tight
little
skirt
and
thence
with
startled
ferocity
to
the
malacca
cane
which
plainly
appeared
to
her
as
a
decoration
not
more
astounding
than
it
was
insulting
perceiving
that
the
girl
was
bowing
to
her
the
globular
lady
hurriedly
made
shift
to
alter
her
injurious
expression
good
morning
dowling
alice
said
gravely
dowling
returned
the
salutation
with
a
smile
as
convincingly
benevolent
as
the
ghastly
smile
upon
a
santa
claus
face
and
then
while
alice
passed
on
exploded
toward
her
a
single
compacted
breath
through
tightened
lips
the
sound
was
eloquently
audible
though
dowling
remained
unaware
that
in
this
or
any
manner
whatever
she
had
shed
a
light
upon
her
thoughts
for
it
was
her
lifelong
innocent
conviction
that
other
people
saw
her
only
as
she
wished
to
be
seen
and
heard
from
her
only
what
she
intended
to
be
heard
at
home
it
was
always
her
husband
who
pulled
down
the
shades
of
their
bedroom
window
alice
looked
serious
for
a
few
moments
after
the
little
encounter
then
found
some
consolation
in
the
behaviour
of
a
gentleman
of
forty
or
so
who
was
coming
toward
her
like
dowling
he
had
begun
to
show
consciousness
of
alice
approach
while
she
was
yet
afar
off
but
his
tokens
were
of
a
kind
pleasanter
to
her
he
was
like
dowling
again
however
in
his
conception
that
alice
would
not
realize
the
significance
of
what
he
did
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
to
see
that
it
lay
neatly
to
his
collar
smoothed
a
lapel
of
his
coat
and
adjusted
his
hat
seeming
to
be
preoccupied
the
while
with
problems
that
kept
his
eyes
to
the
pavement
then
as
he
came
within
a
few
feet
of
her
he
looked
up
as
in
a
surprised
recognition
almost
dramatic
smiled
winningly
lifted
his
hat
decisively
and
carried
it
to
the
full
length
alice
response
was
all
he
could
have
asked
the
cane
in
her
right
hand
stopped
short
in
its
swing
while
her
left
hand
moved
in
a
pretty
gesture
as
if
an
impulse
carried
it
toward
the
heart
and
she
smiled
with
her
under
lip
caught
suddenly
between
her
teeth
months
ago
she
had
seen
an
actress
use
this
smile
in
a
play
and
it
came
perfectly
to
alice
now
without
conscious
direction
it
had
been
so
well
acquired
but
the
pretty
hand
little
impulse
toward
the
heart
was
an
original
bit
all
her
own
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
the
gentleman
went
on
passing
from
her
forward
vision
as
he
replaced
his
hat
of
himself
he
was
nothing
to
alice
except
for
the
gracious
circumstance
that
he
had
shown
strong
consciousness
of
a
pretty
girl
he
was
substantial
a
family
man
securely
married
and
alice
had
with
him
one
of
those
long
acquaintances
that
never
become
emphasized
by
so
much
as
five
minutes
of
talk
yet
for
this
inconsequent
meeting
she
had
enacted
a
little
part
like
a
fragment
in
a
pantomime
of
spanish
wooing
it
was
not
for
him
not
even
to
impress
him
except
as
a
messenger
alice
was
herself
almost
unaware
of
her
thought
which
was
one
of
the
running
thousands
of
her
thoughts
that
took
no
deliberate
form
in
words
nevertheless
she
had
it
and
it
was
the
impulse
of
all
her
pretty
bits
of
pantomime
when
she
met
other
acquaintances
who
made
their
appreciation
visible
as
this
substantial
gentleman
did
in
unworded
thought
he
was
to
be
thus
encouraged
as
in
some
measure
a
champion
to
speak
well
of
her
to
the
world
but
more
than
this
he
was
to
tell
some
magnificent
unknown
bachelor
how
wonderful
how
mysterious
she
was
she
hastened
on
gravely
a
little
stirred
reciprocally
with
the
supposed
stirrings
in
the
breast
of
that
shadowy
ducal
mate
who
must
be
somewhere
waiting
or
perhaps
already
seeking
her
for
she
more
often
thought
of
herself
as
waiting
while
he
sought
her
and
sometimes
this
view
of
things
became
so
definite
that
it
shaped
into
a
murmur
on
her
lips
waiting
just
and
she
might
add
for
him
then
being
she
was
apt
to
conclude
the
mystic
interview
by
laughing
at
herself
though
not
without
a
continued
wistfulness
she
came
to
a
group
of
small
coloured
children
playing
waywardly
in
a
puddle
at
the
mouth
of
a
muddy
alley
and
at
sight
of
her
they
gave
over
their
pastime
in
order
to
stare
she
smiled
brilliantly
upon
them
but
they
were
too
struck
with
wonder
to
comprehend
that
the
manifestation
was
friendly
and
as
alice
picked
her
way
in
a
little
detour
to
keep
from
the
mud
she
heard
one
of
them
say
lady
got
cane
jeez
she
knew
that
many
coloured
children
use
impieties
familiarly
and
she
was
not
startled
she
was
disturbed
however
by
an
unfavourable
hint
in
the
speaker
tone
he
was
six
probably
but
the
sting
of
a
criticism
is
not
necessarily
allayed
by
knowledge
of
its
ignoble
source
and
alice
had
already
begun
to
feel
a
slight
uneasiness
about
her
cane
dowling
stare
had
been
strikingly
projected
at
it
other
women
more
than
merely
glanced
their
brows
and
lips
contracting
impulsively
and
alice
was
aware
that
one
or
two
of
them
frankly
halted
as
soon
as
she
had
passed
she
had
seen
in
several
magazines
pictures
of
ladies
with
canes
and
on
that
account
she
had
bought
this
one
never
questioning
that
fashion
is
recognized
even
in
the
provinces
as
soon
as
beheld
on
the
contrary
these
staring
women
obviously
failed
to
realize
that
what
they
were
being
shown
was
not
an
eccentric
outburst
but
the
bright
harbinger
of
an
illustrious
mode
alice
had
applied
a
bit
of
artificial
pigment
to
her
lips
and
cheeks
before
she
set
forth
this
morning
she
did
not
need
it
having
a
ready
colour
of
her
own
which
now
mounted
high
with
annoyance
then
a
splendidly
shining
closed
black
automobile
with
windows
of
polished
glass
came
silently
down
the
street
toward
her
within
it
as
in
a
luxurious
little
apartment
three
comely
ladies
in
mourning
sat
and
gossiped
but
when
they
saw
alice
they
clutched
one
another
they
instantly
recovered
bowing
to
her
solemnly
as
they
were
borne
by
yet
were
not
gone
from
her
sight
so
swiftly
but
the
edge
of
her
side
glance
caught
a
flash
of
teeth
in
mouths
suddenly
opened
and
the
dark
glisten
of
black
gloves
again
clutching
to
share
mirth
the
colour
that
outdid
the
rouge
on
alice
cheek
extended
its
area
and
grew
warmer
as
she
realized
how
all
too
cordial
had
been
her
nod
and
smile
to
these
humorous
ladies
but
in
their
identity
lay
a
significance
causing
her
a
sharper
smart
for
they
were
of
the
family
of
that
lamb
chief
of
lamb
and
company
who
had
employed
her
father
since
before
she
was
born
and
know
his
salary
they
be
sure
to
find
out
about
that
was
her
thought
coupled
with
another
bitter
one
to
the
effect
that
they
had
probably
made
instantaneous
financial
estimates
of
what
she
wore
though
certainly
her
had
most
fed
their
hilarity
she
tucked
it
under
her
arm
not
swinging
it
again
and
her
breath
became
quick
and
irregular
as
emotion
beset
her
she
had
been
enjoying
her
walk
but
within
the
space
of
the
few
blocks
she
had
gone
since
she
met
the
substantial
gentleman
she
found
that
more
than
the
walk
was
spoiled
suddenly
her
life
seemed
to
be
spoiled
too
though
she
did
not
view
the
ruin
with
complaisance
these
lamb
women
thought
her
and
her
cane
ridiculous
did
they
she
said
to
herself
that
was
their
parvenu
blood
to
think
because
a
girl
father
worked
for
their
grandfather
she
had
no
right
to
be
rather
striking
in
style
especially
when
the
striking
was
her
style
probably
all
the
other
girls
and
women
would
agree
with
them
and
would
laugh
at
her
when
they
got
together
and
what
might
be
fatal
would
try
to
make
all
the
men
think
her
a
silly
pretender
men
were
just
like
sheep
and
nothing
was
easier
than
for
women
to
set
up
as
shepherds
and
pen
them
in
a
fold
to
keep
out
outsiders
alice
thought
and
make
believe
i
am
an
outsider
what
the
use
of
living
all
seemed
lost
when
a
trim
young
man
appeared
striding
out
of
a
not
far
before
her
and
turning
at
the
corner
came
toward
her
visibly
he
slackened
his
gait
to
lengthen
the
time
of
his
approach
and
as
he
was
a
stranger
to
her
no
motive
could
be
ascribed
to
him
other
than
a
wish
to
have
a
longer
time
to
look
at
her
she
lifted
a
pretty
hand
to
a
pin
at
her
throat
bit
her
lip
not
with
the
smile
but
mysteriously
and
at
the
last
instant
before
her
shadow
touched
the
stranger
let
her
eyes
gravely
meet
his
a
moment
later
having
arrived
before
the
house
which
was
her
destination
she
halted
at
the
entrance
to
a
driveway
leading
through
fine
lawns
to
the
intentionally
important
mansion
it
was
a
pleasant
and
impressive
place
to
be
seen
entering
but
alice
did
not
enter
at
once
she
paused
examining
a
tiny
bit
of
mortar
which
the
masons
had
forgotten
to
scrape
from
a
brick
in
one
of
the
massive
she
frowned
at
this
tiny
defacement
and
with
an
air
of
annoyance
scraped
it
away
using
the
ferrule
of
her
cane
an
act
of
fastidious
proprietorship
if
any
one
had
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
he
would
not
have
doubted
that
she
lived
there
alice
did
not
turn
to
see
whether
anything
of
the
sort
happened
or
not
but
she
may
have
surmised
that
it
did
at
all
events
it
was
with
an
invigorated
step
that
she
left
the
gateway
behind
her
and
went
cheerfully
up
the
drive
to
the
house
of
her
friend
mildred
chapter
iv
adams
had
a
restless
morning
and
toward
noon
he
asked
miss
perry
to
call
his
daughter
he
wished
to
say
something
to
her
i
thought
i
heard
her
leaving
the
house
a
couple
of
hours
ago
maybe
longer
the
nurse
told
him
i
go
and
she
returned
from
the
brief
errand
her
impression
confirmed
by
information
from
adams
yes
she
went
up
to
miss
mildred
palmer
to
see
what
she
going
to
wear
adams
looked
at
miss
perry
wearily
but
remained
passive
making
no
inquiries
for
he
was
long
accustomed
to
what
seemed
to
him
a
kind
of
jargon
among
ladies
which
became
the
more
incomprehensible
when
they
tried
to
explain
it
a
man
best
course
he
had
found
was
just
to
let
it
go
as
so
much
sound
his
sorrowful
eyes
followed
the
nurse
as
she
went
back
to
her
by
the
window
and
her
placidity
showed
him
that
there
was
no
mystery
for
her
in
the
fact
that
alice
walked
two
miles
to
ask
so
simple
a
question
when
there
was
a
telephone
in
the
house
obviously
miss
perry
also
comprehended
why
alice
thought
it
important
to
know
what
mildred
meant
to
wear
adams
understood
why
alice
should
be
concerned
with
what
she
herself
wore
to
look
neat
and
tidy
and
at
her
best
why
of
course
she
want
to
he
thought
but
he
realized
that
it
was
forever
beyond
him
to
understand
why
the
clothing
of
other
people
had
long
since
become
an
absorbing
part
of
her
life
her
excursion
this
morning
was
no
novelty
she
was
continually
going
to
see
what
mildred
meant
to
wear
or
what
some
other
girl
meant
to
wear
and
when
alice
came
home
from
wherever
other
girls
or
women
had
been
gathered
she
always
hurried
to
her
mother
with
earnest
descriptions
of
the
clothing
she
had
seen
at
such
times
if
adams
was
present
he
might
recognize
organdie
or
taffeta
or
chiffon
as
words
defining
certain
textiles
but
the
rest
was
too
technical
for
him
and
he
was
like
a
dismal
boy
at
a
sermon
just
waiting
for
it
to
get
itself
finished
not
the
least
of
the
mystery
was
his
wife
interest
she
was
almost
indifferent
about
her
own
clothes
and
when
she
consulted
alice
about
them
spoke
hurriedly
and
with
an
air
of
apology
but
when
alice
described
other
people
clothes
adams
listened
as
eagerly
as
the
daughter
talked
there
they
go
he
muttered
a
moment
after
he
heard
the
front
door
closing
a
sound
recognizable
throughout
most
of
the
thinly
built
house
alice
had
just
returned
and
adams
called
to
her
from
the
upper
hallway
not
far
from
adams
door
what
did
she
say
she
was
sort
of
snippy
about
it
alice
returned
ascending
the
stairs
she
gets
that
way
sometimes
and
pretended
she
had
made
up
her
mind
but
i
pretty
sure
it
be
the
maize
georgette
with
malines
did
you
say
she
wore
that
at
the
pattersons
adams
inquired
as
alice
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
did
you
tell
me
she
wore
it
again
at
the
certainly
not
alice
interrupted
rather
petulantly
she
never
worn
it
but
once
and
of
course
she
would
want
to
wear
anything
that
people
have
seen
her
in
a
miss
perry
opened
the
door
of
adams
room
and
stepped
out
your
father
wants
to
know
if
you
come
and
see
him
a
minute
miss
poor
old
thing
of
course
alice
exclaimed
and
went
quickly
into
the
room
miss
perry
remaining
outside
what
the
matter
papa
getting
awful
sick
of
lying
on
his
tired
old
back
i
i
had
kind
of
a
poor
morning
adams
said
as
she
patted
his
hand
comfortingly
i
been
thinking
did
i
tell
you
not
to
she
cried
gaily
of
course
you
have
poor
times
when
you
go
and
do
just
exactly
what
i
say
you
must
you
stop
thinking
this
very
minute
he
smiled
ruefully
closing
his
eyes
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
asked
her
to
sit
beside
the
bed
i
been
thinking
of
something
i
wanted
to
say
he
added
what
like
papa
well
it
nothing
much
he
said
with
something
deprecatory
in
his
tone
as
if
he
felt
vague
impulses
toward
both
humour
and
apology
i
just
thought
maybe
i
ought
to
said
more
to
you
some
time
or
other
about
well
about
the
way
things
are
down
at
lamb
and
company
for
now
papa
she
leaned
forward
in
the
chair
she
had
taken
and
pretended
to
slap
his
hand
crossly
is
that
exactly
what
i
said
you
could
think
one
single
think
about
till
you
get
all
well
well
he
said
and
went
on
slowly
not
looking
at
her
but
at
the
ceiling
i
just
thought
maybe
it
would
been
any
harm
if
some
time
or
other
i
told
you
something
about
the
way
they
sort
of
depend
on
me
down
why
do
they
show
it
then
she
asked
quickly
that
just
what
mama
and
i
have
been
feeling
so
much
they
do
appreciate
why
yes
they
do
he
said
yes
they
do
they
began
my
salary
the
second
year
i
went
in
there
and
they
it
a
little
every
two
years
all
the
time
i
worked
for
i
been
head
of
the
sundries
department
for
seven
years
now
and
i
could
hardly
have
more
authority
in
that
department
unless
i
was
a
member
of
the
firm
well
why
do
they
make
you
a
member
of
the
firm
that
what
they
ought
to
done
yes
and
long
ago
adams
laughed
but
sighed
with
more
heartiness
than
he
had
laughed
they
call
me
their
down
he
laughed
again
apologetically
as
if
to
excuse
himself
for
taking
a
little
pride
in
this
title
yes
sir
they
say
i
their
and
i
guess
they
know
they
can
count
on
my
department
turning
in
as
good
a
report
as
they
look
for
at
the
end
of
every
month
but
they
do
have
to
take
a
man
into
the
firm
to
get
him
to
do
my
work
but
you
said
they
depended
on
you
so
they
do
but
of
course
not
so
they
could
get
along
without
he
paused
reflecting
i
do
just
seem
to
know
how
to
put
it
i
mean
how
to
put
what
i
started
out
to
say
i
kind
of
wanted
to
tell
you
well
it
seems
funny
to
me
these
last
few
years
the
way
your
mother
taken
to
feeling
about
it
i
like
to
see
a
better
established
wholesale
drug
business
than
lamb
and
company
this
side
the
alleghanies
i
do
say
bigger
i
say
better
established
and
it
kind
of
funny
for
a
man
that
been
with
a
business
like
that
as
long
as
i
have
to
hear
it
called
a
it
kind
of
funny
when
you
think
yourself
you
done
pretty
fairly
well
in
a
business
like
that
and
the
men
at
the
head
of
it
seem
to
think
so
too
and
put
your
salary
just
about
as
high
as
anybody
could
consider
customary
well
what
i
mean
alice
it
kind
of
funny
to
have
your
mother
think
it
mostly
just
mostly
just
a
failure
so
to
his
voice
had
become
tremulous
in
spite
of
him
and
this
sign
of
weakness
and
emotion
had
sufficient
effect
upon
alice
she
bent
over
him
suddenly
with
her
arm
about
him
and
her
cheek
against
his
poor
papa
she
murmured
poor
papa
no
no
he
said
i
did
mean
anything
to
trouble
you
i
just
thought
he
hesitated
i
just
wondered
i
thought
maybe
it
be
any
harm
if
i
said
something
about
how
things
are
down
there
i
got
to
thinking
maybe
you
did
understand
it
a
pretty
good
place
they
fine
people
to
work
for
and
they
always
seemed
to
think
something
of
me
the
way
they
took
walter
on
for
instance
soon
as
i
asked
last
year
do
you
think
that
looked
a
good
deal
as
if
they
thought
something
of
me
alice
yes
papa
she
said
not
moving
and
the
work
right
pleasant
he
went
on
mighty
nice
boys
in
our
department
alice
well
they
are
in
all
the
departments
for
that
matter
we
have
a
good
deal
of
fun
down
there
some
she
lifted
her
head
more
than
you
do
at
home
days
i
expect
papa
she
said
he
protested
feebly
now
i
did
mean
that
i
did
want
to
trouble
you
she
looked
at
him
through
winking
eyelashes
i
sorry
i
called
it
a
no
no
he
protested
gently
it
was
your
mother
said
no
i
did
well
if
you
did
it
was
only
because
you
heard
she
shook
her
head
then
kissed
him
i
going
to
talk
to
her
she
said
and
rose
decisively
but
at
this
her
father
troubled
voice
became
quickly
louder
you
better
let
her
alone
i
just
wanted
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
i
did
mean
to
start
any
your
mother
wo
now
papa
alice
spoke
cheerfully
again
and
smiled
upon
him
i
want
you
to
quit
worrying
everything
going
to
be
all
right
and
going
to
bother
you
any
more
about
anything
you
see
she
carried
her
smile
out
into
the
hall
but
after
she
had
closed
the
door
her
face
was
all
pity
and
her
mother
waiting
for
her
in
the
opposite
room
spoke
sympathetically
what
the
matter
alice
what
did
he
say
that
upset
you
wait
a
minute
alice
found
a
handkerchief
used
it
for
eyes
and
suffused
nose
gulped
then
suddenly
and
desolately
sat
upon
the
bed
poor
poor
poor
papa
she
whispered
why
adams
inquired
mildly
what
the
matter
with
him
sometimes
you
act
as
if
he
were
getting
well
what
he
been
talking
about
mama
well
i
think
i
pretty
selfish
oh
i
do
did
he
say
you
were
papa
no
indeed
what
i
mean
is
maybe
we
both
a
little
selfish
to
try
to
make
him
go
out
and
hunt
around
for
something
adams
looked
thoughtful
oh
that
what
he
was
up
to
mama
i
think
we
ought
to
give
it
up
i
did
dream
it
had
really
hurt
well
does
he
hurt
us
never
that
i
know
of
i
do
mean
by
saying
things
adams
explained
impatiently
there
are
more
ways
than
that
of
hurting
people
when
a
man
sticks
to
a
salary
that
does
provide
for
his
family
is
that
hurting
them
oh
it
for
us
well
enough
mama
we
have
what
we
need
if
i
were
so
extravagant
oh
know
i
am
but
at
this
admission
her
mother
cried
out
sharply
you
have
one
tenth
of
what
the
other
girls
you
go
with
have
and
you
ca
have
what
you
ought
to
as
long
as
he
does
get
out
of
that
horrible
place
it
provides
bare
food
and
shelter
for
us
but
that
i
do
think
we
ought
to
try
any
more
to
change
you
do
adams
came
and
stood
before
her
listen
alice
your
father
asleep
that
his
trouble
and
he
got
to
be
waked
up
he
does
know
that
things
have
changed
when
you
and
walter
were
little
children
we
did
have
enough
at
least
it
seemed
to
be
about
as
much
as
most
of
the
people
we
knew
but
the
town
is
what
it
was
in
those
days
and
times
are
what
they
were
then
and
these
fearful
prices
are
the
old
prices
everything
else
but
your
father
has
changed
and
all
the
time
he
stood
still
he
does
know
it
he
thinks
because
they
given
him
a
hundred
dollars
more
every
two
years
he
quite
a
prosperous
man
and
he
thinks
that
because
his
children
cost
him
more
than
he
and
i
cost
our
parents
he
gives
them
enough
but
walter
alice
faltered
walter
does
cost
him
anything
at
all
any
and
she
concluded
in
a
stricken
voice
it
all
me
why
should
it
be
her
mother
cried
you
young
you
just
at
the
time
when
your
life
should
be
fullest
of
good
things
and
happiness
yet
what
do
you
get
alice
lip
quivered
she
was
not
unsusceptible
to
such
an
appeal
but
she
contrived
the
semblance
of
a
protest
i
do
have
such
a
bad
time
not
a
good
deal
of
the
time
anyhow
i
got
a
good
many
of
the
things
other
girls
have
you
have
adams
was
piteously
satirical
i
suppose
you
got
a
limousine
to
go
to
that
dance
i
suppose
you
only
got
to
call
a
florist
and
tell
him
to
send
you
some
orchids
i
suppose
you
but
alice
interrupted
this
list
apparently
in
a
single
instant
all
emotion
left
her
and
she
became
businesslike
as
one
in
the
midst
of
trifles
reminded
of
really
serious
matters
she
got
up
from
the
bed
and
went
to
the
door
of
the
closet
where
she
kept
her
dresses
oh
see
here
she
said
briskly
i
decided
to
wear
my
white
organdie
if
you
could
put
in
a
new
lining
for
me
i
afraid
it
take
you
nearly
all
she
brought
forth
the
dress
displayed
it
upon
the
bed
and
adams
examined
it
attentively
do
you
think
you
could
get
it
done
mama
i
do
see
why
not
adams
answered
passing
a
thoughtful
hand
over
the
fabric
it
ought
to
take
more
than
four
or
five
it
a
shame
to
have
you
sit
at
the
machine
that
long
alice
said
absently
adding
and
i
sure
we
ought
to
let
papa
alone
let
just
give
it
up
adams
continued
her
thoughtful
examination
of
the
dress
did
you
buy
the
chiffon
and
ribbon
alice
yes
i
sure
we
ought
to
talk
to
him
about
it
any
more
well
we
let
both
agree
that
we
never
say
another
single
word
to
him
about
it
said
alice
it
be
a
great
deal
better
if
we
just
let
him
make
up
his
mind
for
chapter
v
with
this
having
more
immediately
practical
questions
before
them
they
dropped
the
subject
to
bend
their
entire
attention
upon
the
dress
and
when
the
sounded
downstairs
alice
was
still
sketching
repairs
and
alterations
she
continued
to
sketch
them
not
heeding
the
summons
i
suppose
we
better
go
down
to
lunch
adams
said
absently
she
at
the
gong
in
a
minute
mama
now
about
the
sleeves
and
she
went
on
with
her
planning
unfortunately
the
gong
was
inexpressive
of
the
mood
of
the
person
who
beat
upon
it
it
consisted
of
three
little
metal
bowls
upon
a
string
they
were
unequal
in
size
and
upon
being
tapped
with
a
padded
stick
gave
forth
vibrations
almost
musically
pleasant
it
was
alice
who
had
substituted
this
contrivance
for
the
brass
in
use
throughout
her
childhood
and
neither
she
nor
the
others
of
her
family
realized
that
the
substitution
of
sweeter
sounds
had
made
the
life
of
that
household
more
difficult
in
spite
of
dismaying
increases
in
wages
the
adamses
still
strove
to
keep
a
cook
and
as
they
were
unable
to
pay
the
higher
rates
demanded
by
a
good
one
what
they
usually
had
was
a
whimsical
coloured
woman
of
nomadic
impulses
in
the
hands
of
such
a
person
the
was
satisfying
life
could
instantly
be
made
intolerable
for
any
one
dawdling
on
his
way
to
a
meal
the
bell
was
capable
of
every
desirable
profanity
and
left
nothing
bottled
up
in
the
breast
of
the
ringer
but
the
stick
might
whack
upon
alice
little
chinese
bowls
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
and
produce
no
great
effect
of
urgency
upon
a
hearer
nor
any
other
effect
except
fury
in
the
cook
the
ironical
impossibility
of
expressing
indignation
otherwise
than
by
sounds
of
gentle
harmony
proved
exasperating
the
cook
was
apt
to
become
surcharged
so
that
explosive
resignations
never
rare
were
somewhat
more
frequent
after
the
introduction
of
the
gong
adams
took
this
increased
frequency
to
be
only
another
manifestation
of
the
inexplicable
new
difficulties
that
beset
all
housekeeping
you
paid
a
cook
double
what
you
had
paid
one
a
few
years
before
and
the
cook
knew
half
as
much
of
cookery
and
had
no
gratitude
the
more
you
gave
these
people
it
seemed
the
worse
they
behaved
a
condition
not
to
be
remedied
by
simply
giving
them
less
because
you
could
even
get
the
worst
unless
you
paid
her
what
she
demanded
nevertheless
adams
remained
fitfully
an
optimist
in
the
matter
brought
up
by
her
mother
to
speak
of
a
female
cook
as
the
girl
she
had
been
instructed
by
alice
to
drop
that
definition
in
favour
of
one
not
an
improvement
in
accuracy
the
almost
always
during
the
first
day
or
so
after
every
cook
came
adams
would
say
at
intervals
with
an
air
of
triumph
i
believe
of
course
it
a
little
soon
to
be
sure
but
i
do
really
believe
this
new
maid
is
the
treasure
we
been
looking
for
so
long
much
in
the
same
way
that
alice
dreamed
of
a
mysterious
perfect
mate
for
whom
she
waited
her
mother
had
a
fairy
theory
that
hidden
somewhere
in
the
universe
there
was
the
treasure
the
perfect
maid
who
would
come
and
cook
in
the
kitchen
not
four
days
or
four
weeks
but
forever
the
present
incumbent
was
not
she
alice
profoundly
interested
herself
kept
her
mother
likewise
so
preoccupied
with
the
dress
that
they
were
but
vaguely
conscious
of
the
gong
soft
warnings
though
these
were
repeated
and
protracted
unusually
finally
the
sound
of
a
hearty
voice
independent
and
enraged
reached
the
pair
it
came
from
the
hall
below
i
says
it
called
all
then
the
front
door
slammed
why
what
adams
began
they
went
down
hurriedly
to
find
out
miss
perry
informed
them
i
could
make
her
listen
to
reason
she
said
she
rang
the
gong
four
or
five
times
and
got
to
talking
to
herself
and
then
she
went
up
to
her
room
and
packed
her
bag
i
told
her
she
had
no
business
to
go
out
the
front
door
adams
took
the
news
philosophically
i
thought
she
had
something
like
that
in
her
eye
when
i
paid
her
this
morning
and
i
not
surprised
well
we
wo
let
adams
know
anything
the
matter
till
i
get
a
new
they
lunched
upon
what
the
late
incumbent
had
left
chilling
on
the
table
and
then
adams
prepared
to
wash
the
dishes
she
would
have
them
done
in
a
jiffy
she
said
cheerfully
but
it
was
alice
who
washed
the
dishes
i
do
like
to
have
you
do
that
alice
her
mother
protested
following
her
into
the
kitchen
it
roughens
the
hands
and
when
a
girl
has
hands
like
yours
i
know
alice
looked
troubled
but
shook
her
head
it
ca
be
helped
this
time
you
need
every
minute
to
get
that
dress
adams
went
away
lamenting
while
alice
no
expert
began
to
splash
the
plates
and
cups
and
saucers
in
the
warm
water
after
a
while
as
she
worked
her
eyes
grew
dreamy
she
was
making
little
pictures
of
herself
unfounded
prophecies
of
how
she
would
look
and
what
would
happen
to
her
that
evening
she
saw
herself
charming
and
demure
wearing
a
fluffy
idealization
of
the
dress
her
mother
now
determinedly
struggled
with
upstairs
she
saw
herself
framed
in
a
garlanded
archway
the
entrance
to
a
ballroom
and
saw
the
people
on
the
shining
floor
turning
dramatically
to
look
at
her
then
from
all
points
a
rush
of
young
men
shouting
for
dances
with
her
and
she
constructed
a
superb
stranger
tall
dark
masterfully
smiling
who
swung
her
out
of
the
clamouring
group
as
the
music
began
she
saw
herself
dancing
with
him
saw
the
smile
she
would
give
him
and
she
accurately
smiled
that
smile
as
she
rinsed
the
knives
and
forks
these
hopeful
fragments
of
drama
were
not
to
be
realized
she
knew
but
she
played
that
they
were
true
and
went
on
creating
them
in
all
of
them
she
wore
or
carried
flowers
her
mother
sorrow
for
her
in
this
detail
but
made
it
the
more
important
and
she
saw
herself
glamorous
with
orchids
discarded
these
for
an
armful
of
heavy
roses
tossed
them
away
for
a
great
bouquet
of
white
camellias
and
so
wandered
down
a
lengthening
hothouse
gallery
of
floral
beauty
all
costly
and
beyond
her
reach
except
in
such
a
wistful
and
upon
her
present
whole
horizon
though
she
searched
it
earnestly
she
could
discover
no
figure
of
a
sender
of
flowers
out
of
her
fancies
the
desire
for
flowers
to
wear
that
night
emerged
definitely
and
became
poignant
she
began
to
feel
that
it
might
be
particularly
important
to
have
them
this
might
be
the
night
she
was
still
at
the
age
to
dream
that
the
night
of
any
dance
may
be
the
vital
point
in
destiny
no
matter
how
commonplace
or
disappointing
other
dance
nights
have
been
this
one
may
bring
the
great
meeting
the
unknown
magnifico
may
be
there
alice
was
almost
unaware
of
her
own
reveries
in
which
this
being
appeared
reveries
often
so
transitory
that
they
developed
and
passed
in
a
few
seconds
and
in
some
of
them
the
being
was
not
wholly
a
stranger
there
were
moments
when
he
seemed
to
be
composed
of
recognizable
fragments
of
young
men
she
knew
a
smile
she
had
liked
from
one
the
figure
of
another
the
hair
of
another
and
sometimes
she
thought
he
might
be
concealed
so
to
say
within
the
person
of
an
actual
acquaintance
someone
she
had
never
suspected
of
being
the
right
seeker
for
her
someone
who
had
never
suspected
that
it
was
she
who
waited
for
him
anything
might
reveal
them
to
each
other
a
look
a
turn
of
the
head
a
singular
word
perhaps
some
flowers
upon
her
breast
or
in
her
hand
she
wiped
the
dishes
slowly
concluding
the
operation
by
dropping
a
saucer
upon
the
floor
and
dreamily
sweeping
the
fragments
under
the
stove
she
sighed
and
replaced
the
broom
near
a
window
letting
her
glance
wander
over
the
small
yard
outside
the
grass
repulsively
besooted
to
the
colour
of
all
winter
had
lately
come
to
life
again
and
now
sparkled
with
green
in
the
midst
of
which
a
tiny
shot
of
blue
suddenly
fixed
her
absent
eyes
they
remained
upon
it
for
several
moments
becoming
less
absent
it
was
a
violet
alice
ran
upstairs
put
on
her
hat
went
outdoors
and
began
to
search
out
the
violets
she
found
a
bright
omen
since
the
number
was
that
of
her
years
but
not
enough
violets
there
were
no
more
she
had
ransacked
every
foot
of
the
yard
she
looked
dubiously
at
the
little
bunch
in
her
hand
glanced
at
the
lawn
next
door
which
offered
no
favourable
prospect
then
went
thoughtfully
into
the
house
left
her
violets
in
a
bowl
of
water
and
came
quickly
out
again
her
brow
marked
with
a
frown
of
decision
she
went
to
a
and
took
a
car
to
the
outskirts
of
the
city
where
a
new
park
had
been
opened
here
she
resumed
her
search
but
it
was
not
an
easily
rewarded
one
and
for
an
hour
after
her
arrival
she
found
no
violets
she
walked
conscientiously
over
the
whole
stretch
of
meadow
her
eyes
roving
discontentedly
there
was
never
a
blue
dot
in
the
groomed
expanse
but
at
last
as
she
came
near
the
borders
of
an
old
grove
of
trees
left
untouched
by
the
municipal
landscapers
the
little
flowers
appeared
and
she
began
to
gather
them
she
picked
them
carefully
loosening
the
earth
round
each
tiny
plant
so
as
to
bring
the
roots
up
with
it
that
it
might
live
the
longer
and
she
had
brought
a
napkin
which
she
drenched
at
a
hydrant
and
kept
loosely
wrapped
about
the
stems
of
her
collection
the
turf
was
too
damp
for
her
to
kneel
she
worked
patiently
stooping
from
the
waist
and
when
she
got
home
in
a
drizzle
of
rain
at
five
her
knees
were
tremulous
with
strain
her
back
ached
and
she
was
tired
all
over
but
she
had
three
hundred
violets
her
mother
moaned
when
alice
showed
them
to
her
fragrant
in
a
basin
of
water
oh
you
poor
child
to
think
of
your
having
to
work
so
hard
to
get
things
that
other
girls
only
need
lift
their
little
fingers
for
never
mind
said
alice
huskily
i
got
and
i
am
going
to
have
a
good
time
you
just
got
to
adams
agreed
intensely
sympathetic
the
lord
knows
you
deserve
to
after
picking
all
these
violets
poor
thing
and
he
would
be
mean
enough
to
keep
you
from
it
i
may
have
to
get
dinner
before
i
finish
the
dress
but
i
can
get
it
done
in
a
few
minutes
afterward
and
it
going
to
look
right
pretty
do
you
worry
about
that
and
with
all
these
lovely
violets
i
wonder
alice
began
paused
then
went
on
fragmentarily
i
suppose
well
i
wonder
do
you
suppose
it
would
have
been
better
policy
to
have
told
walter
before
no
said
her
mother
it
would
only
have
given
him
longer
to
but
he
might
do
worry
adams
reassured
her
he
be
a
little
cross
but
he
wo
be
stubborn
just
let
me
talk
to
him
and
do
you
say
anything
at
all
no
matter
what
he
these
references
to
walter
concerned
some
necessary
manoeuvres
which
took
place
at
dinner
and
were
conducted
by
the
mother
alice
having
accepted
her
advice
to
sit
in
silence
adams
began
by
laughing
cheerfully
i
wonder
how
much
longer
it
took
me
to
cook
this
dinner
than
it
does
walter
to
eat
it
she
said
do
gobble
child
no
in
contact
with
his
own
family
walter
was
no
squanderer
of
words
is
for
me
he
said
got
i
know
you
have
but
there
plenty
of
he
smiled
in
benevolent
pity
you
know
do
you
if
you
made
any
coffee
do
bother
if
you
did
get
some
he
seemed
about
to
rise
and
depart
whereupon
alice
biting
her
lip
sent
a
glance
at
her
mother
but
adams
seemed
not
at
all
disturbed
and
laughed
again
why
what
nonsense
walter
i
bring
your
coffee
in
a
few
minutes
but
we
going
to
have
dessert
what
sort
some
lovely
doe
want
canned
peaches
said
the
frank
walter
moving
back
his
chair
walter
it
does
begin
till
about
nine
at
the
he
paused
mystified
what
does
the
what
dance
why
mildred
palmer
dance
of
walter
laughed
briefly
what
that
to
me
why
you
have
forgotten
it
have
you
adams
cried
what
a
boy
i
told
you
a
week
ago
i
was
going
to
that
ole
dance
he
returned
frowning
you
heard
walter
she
exclaimed
of
course
you
going
i
got
your
clothes
all
out
this
afternoon
and
brushed
them
for
you
they
look
very
nice
and
they
wo
look
nice
on
me
he
interrupted
got
date
i
tell
but
of
course
you
see
here
walter
said
decisively
do
get
any
wrong
ideas
in
your
head
i
just
as
liable
to
go
up
to
that
ole
dance
at
the
palmers
as
i
am
to
eat
a
couple
of
barrels
of
broken
but
walter
walter
was
beginning
to
be
seriously
annoyed
do
me
i
no
snake
i
would
jazz
with
that
palmer
crowd
if
they
coaxed
me
with
walter
did
i
tell
you
it
no
use
to
me
he
demanded
my
dear
child
oh
glory
at
this
adams
abandoned
her
air
of
amusement
looked
hurt
and
glanced
at
the
demure
miss
perry
across
the
table
i
afraid
miss
perry
wo
think
you
have
very
good
manners
you
right
she
wo
he
agreed
grimly
not
if
i
haf
to
hear
any
more
about
me
goin
to
but
his
mother
interrupted
him
with
some
asperity
it
seems
very
strange
that
you
always
object
to
going
anywhere
among
our
friends
your
friends
he
said
and
rising
from
his
chair
gave
utterance
to
an
ironical
laugh
strictly
monosyllabic
your
friends
he
repeated
going
to
the
door
oh
yes
certainly
and
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
to
offer
a
final
brief
view
of
his
derisive
face
he
took
himself
out
of
the
room
alice
gasped
mama
i
stop
him
her
mother
responded
sharply
and
hurried
after
the
truant
catching
him
at
the
front
door
with
his
hat
and
raincoat
on
walter
told
you
had
a
date
he
said
gruffly
and
would
have
opened
the
door
but
she
caught
his
arm
and
detained
him
walter
please
come
back
and
finish
your
dinner
when
i
take
all
the
trouble
to
cook
it
for
you
i
think
you
might
at
least
now
now
he
said
that
is
what
you
up
to
you
do
want
to
make
me
eat
you
want
to
make
me
well
you
must
listen
she
retained
her
grasp
upon
his
arm
and
made
it
tighter
walter
please
she
entreated
her
voice
becoming
tremulous
please
do
make
me
so
much
trouble
he
drew
back
from
her
as
far
as
her
hold
upon
him
permitted
and
looked
at
her
sharply
look
here
he
said
i
get
you
all
right
what
the
matter
of
alice
goin
to
that
party
by
herself
she
just
ca
why
not
it
makes
things
too
mean
for
her
walter
all
the
other
girls
have
somebody
to
depend
on
after
they
get
well
why
does
she
have
somebody
he
asked
testily
somebody
besides
me
i
mean
why
has
somebody
asked
her
to
go
she
ought
to
be
that
popular
anyhow
i
sh
think
she
tries
enough
i
do
understand
how
you
can
be
so
hard
his
mother
wailed
huskily
you
know
why
they
do
run
after
her
the
way
they
do
the
other
girls
she
goes
with
walter
it
because
we
poor
and
she
has
got
any
background
walter
repeated
what
kind
of
talk
is
that
you
will
go
with
her
walter
his
mother
pleaded
not
stopping
to
enlighten
him
you
do
understand
how
hard
things
are
for
her
and
how
brave
she
is
about
them
or
you
could
be
so
selfish
be
more
than
i
can
bear
to
see
her
disappointed
she
went
clear
out
to
belleview
park
this
afternoon
walter
and
spent
hours
and
hours
picking
violets
to
wear
you
will
walter
heart
was
not
iron
and
the
episode
of
the
violets
may
have
reached
it
oh
blub
he
said
and
flung
his
soft
hat
violently
at
the
wall
his
mother
beamed
with
delight
that
a
good
boy
darling
never
be
sorry
you
cut
it
out
he
requested
if
i
take
her
will
you
pay
for
a
taxi
oh
walter
and
again
adams
showed
distress
could
you
no
i
could
i
not
goin
to
throw
away
my
good
money
like
that
and
you
ca
tell
what
time
o
night

before
she
willin
to
come
home

the
matter

for
one

have
any
well
father
she
shook
her
head
dolefully
i
got
some
from
him
this
morning
and
i
ca
bother
him
for
any
more
it
upsets
him
he
always
been
so
terribly
close
with
money
i
guess
he
could
help
that
walter
observed
we
liable
to
go
to
the
poorhouse
the
way
it
is
well
what
the
matter
our
walkin
to
this
rotten
party
in
the
rain
walter
well
it
only
a
drizzle
and
we
can
take
a
streetcar
to
within
a
block
of
the
again
his
mother
shook
her
head
it
would
well
darn
the
luck
all
right
he
consented
explosively
i
get
her
something
to
ride
in
it
means
why
walter
adams
cried
much
pleased
do
you
know
how
to
get
a
cab
for
that
little
how
splendid
tai
a
cab
walter
informed
her
crossly
it
a
tin
lizzie
but
you
do
haf
to
tell
her
what
it
is
till
i
get
her
into
it
do
you
adams
agreed
that
she
did
chapter
vi
alice
was
busy
with
herself
for
two
hours
after
dinner
but
a
little
before
nine
she
stood
in
front
of
her
long
mirror
completed
and
solemn
her
hair
exquisitely
arranged
gave
all
she
asked
of
it
what
artificialities
in
colour
she
had
used
upon
her
face
were
only
bits
of
emphasis
that
made
her
prettiness
the
more
distinct
and
the
dress
not
rumpled
by
her
mother
careful
hours
of
work
was
a
white
cloud
of
loveliness
finally
there
were
two
triumphant
bouquets
of
violets
each
with
the
stems
wrapped
in
shrouded
by
a
bow
of
purple
chiffon
and
one
bouquet
she
wore
at
her
waist
and
the
other
she
carried
in
her
hand
miss
perry
called
in
by
a
rapturous
mother
for
the
free
treat
of
a
look
at
this
radiance
insisted
that
alice
was
a
vision
purely
and
simply
a
vision
she
said
meaning
that
no
other
definition
whatever
would
satisfy
her
i
never
saw
anybody
look
a
vision
if
she
do
look
one
the
admiring
nurse
declared
her
papa
think
the
same
i
do
about
it
you
see
if
he
does
say
she
purely
and
simply
a
adams
did
not
fulfil
the
prediction
quite
literally
when
alice
paid
a
brief
visit
to
his
room
to
show
him
and
bid
him
but
he
chuckled
feebly
well
well
well
he
said
you
look
mighty
fine
mighty
fine
and
he
waggled
a
bony
finger
at
her
two
bouquets
why
alice
who
your
beau
never
you
mind
she
laughed
archly
brushing
his
nose
with
the
violets
in
her
hand
he
treats
me
pretty
well
does
he
must
like
to
throw
his
money
around
these
violets
smell
mighty
sweet
and
they
ought
to
if
they
going
to
a
party
with
you
have
a
good
time
i
mean
to
she
cried
and
she
repeated
this
gaily
but
with
an
emphasis
expressing
sharp
determination
as
she
left
him
i
mean
to
what
was
he
talking
about
her
mother
inquired
smoothing
the
rather
worn
and
old
evening
wrap
she
had
placed
on
alice
bed
what
were
you
telling
him
you
to
alice
went
back
to
her
triple
mirror
for
the
last
time
then
stood
before
the
long
one
that
i
mean
to
have
a
good
time
she
said
and
as
she
turned
from
her
reflection
to
the
wrap
adams
held
up
for
her
it
looks
as
though
i
could
do
you
think
so
you
just
be
a
queen
her
mother
whispered
in
fond
emotion
you
must
doubt
well
there
one
thing
said
alice
i
think
i
do
look
nice
enough
to
get
along
without
having
to
dance
with
that
frank
dowling
all
i
ask
is
for
it
to
happen
just
once
and
if
he
comes
near
me
i
going
to
treat
him
the
way
the
other
girls
do
do
you
suppose
walter
got
the
taxi
out
in
front
he
he
waiting
down
in
the
hall
adams
answered
nervously
and
she
held
up
another
garment
to
go
over
the
wrap
alice
frowned
at
it
what
that
mama
it
it
your
father
raincoat
i
thought
you
put
it
on
over
but
i
wo
need
it
in
a
you
will
to
get
in
and
out
and
you
need
take
it
into
the
palmers
you
can
leave
it
in
the
in
the
it
drizzling
and
you
need
oh
well
alice
consented
and
a
few
minutes
later
as
with
assistance
she
climbed
into
the
vehicle
he
had
provided
she
better
understood
her
mother
solicitude
what
on
earth
is
this
walter
she
asked
never
mind
it
keep
you
dry
enough
with
the
top
up
he
returned
taking
his
seat
beside
her
then
for
a
time
as
they
went
rather
jerkily
up
the
street
she
was
silent
but
finally
she
repeated
her
question
what
is
it
walter
what
what
this
this
car
it
a
i
mean
what
kind
is
it
have
you
got
eyes
it
too
it
a
tin
lizzie
said
walter
know
what
that
means
it
means
a
yes
got
why
no
dear
she
said
placatively
is
it
yours
walter
have
you
bought
it
me
he
laughed
could
buy
a
used
wheelbarrow
i
rent
this
sometimes
when
i
goin
out
among
costs
me
cents
and
the
price
o
the
that
seems
very
i
guess
it
is
the
feller
owes
me
some
money
and
this
is
the
only
way
i
ever
get
it
off
is
he
a
not
exactly
walter
uttered
husky
sounds
of
amusement
you
be
just
as
happy
i
guess
if
you
do
know
who
he
is
he
said
his
tone
misgave
her
and
she
said
truthfully
that
she
was
content
not
to
know
who
owned
the
car
i
joke
sometimes
about
how
you
keep
things
to
yourself
she
added
but
i
really
never
do
pry
in
your
affairs
oh
no
you
do
indeed
i
yes
you
mighty
nice
and
cooing
when
you
got
me
where
you
want
me
he
jeered
well
just
as
soon
tell
you
where
i
get
this
i
just
as
soon
you
would
walter
she
said
hurriedly
please
but
walter
meant
to
tell
her
why
there
nothin
exactly
criminal
about
it
he
said
it
belongs
to
old
j
lamb
himself
he
keeps
it
for
their
coon
chauffeur
i
rent
it
from
from
lamb
no
from
the
coon
walter
she
gasped
sure
i
do
i
can
get
it
any
night
when
the
coon
is
goin
to
use
it
himself
he
drivin
their
limousine
that
little
henrietta
lamb
goin
to
the
party
no
matter
if
her
father
has
only
been
dead
a
year
he
paused
then
inquired
well
how
like
it
she
did
not
speak
and
he
began
to
be
remorseful
for
having
imparted
so
much
information
though
his
way
of
expressing
regret
was
his
own
well
you
will
make
the
folks
make
me
take
you
to
parties
he
said
i
got
to
do
it
the
best
way
i
can
do
i
then
as
she
made
no
response
oh
the
car
clean
enough
he
said
this
coon
he
as
particular
as
any
white
man
you
need
worry
about
and
as
she
still
said
nothing
he
added
gruffly
i
of
had
a
better
car
if
i
could
afforded
it
you
need
get
so
upset
about
i
do
understand
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
do
understand
how
you
know
such
such
people
as
who
as
coloured
oh
look
here
now
he
protested
loudly
do
you
know
this
is
a
democratic
country
not
quite
that
democratic
is
it
walter
the
trouble
with
you
he
retorted
you
do
know
there
anybody
in
town
except
just
this
he
paused
seeming
to
await
a
refutation
but
as
none
came
he
expressed
himself
definitely
they
make
me
they
were
coming
near
their
destination
and
the
glow
of
the
big
brightly
lighted
house
was
seen
before
them
in
the
wet
night
other
cars
not
like
theirs
were
approaching
this
center
of
brilliance
long
triangles
of
light
near
the
ground
swept
through
the
fine
drizzle
small
red
gleamed
again
from
the
moist
pavement
of
the
street
and
through
the
myriads
of
little
glistening
leaves
along
the
curving
driveway
glimpses
were
caught
of
lively
colours
moving
in
a
white
glare
as
the
limousines
released
their
occupants
under
the
shelter
of
the
alice
clutched
walter
arm
in
a
panic
they
were
just
at
the
driveway
entrance
walter
we
must
go
in
what
the
matter
leave
this
awful
car
why
i
stop
she
insisted
vehemently
you
got
to
go
back
oh
glory
the
little
car
was
between
the
entrance
posts
but
walter
backed
it
out
avoiding
a
collision
with
an
impressive
machine
which
swerved
away
from
them
and
passed
on
toward
the
showing
a
man
face
grinning
at
the
window
as
it
went
by
flivver
runabout
got
the
wrong
number
he
said
did
he
see
us
alice
cried
did
who
see
us
harvey
malone
in
that
foreign
no
he
could
tell
who
we
were
under
this
top
walter
assured
her
as
he
brought
the
little
car
to
a
standstill
beside
the
curbstone
out
in
the
street
what
it
matter
if
he
did
the
big
fish
alice
responded
with
a
loud
sigh
and
sat
still
well
want
to
go
on
back
walter
inquired
you
bet
i
willing
well
then
what
the
matter
our
drivin
on
up
to
the
there
room
for
me
to
park
just
the
other
side
of
no
no
what
you
expect
to
do
sit
here
all
night
no
leave
the
car
do
care
where
we
leave
it
he
said
sit
still
till
i
lock
her
so
none
o
these
millionaires
around
here
run
off
with
he
got
out
with
a
padlock
and
chain
and
having
put
these
in
place
offered
alice
his
hand
come
on
if
you
wait
she
said
and
divesting
herself
of
the
raincoat
handed
it
to
walter
please
leave
this
with
your
things
in
the
men
as
if
it
were
an
extra
one
of
your
own
he
nodded
she
jumped
out
and
they
scurried
through
the
drizzle
as
they
reached
the
she
began
to
laugh
airily
and
spoke
to
the
impassive
man
in
livery
who
stood
there
joke
on
us
she
said
hurrying
by
him
toward
the
door
of
the
house
our
car
broke
down
outside
the
the
man
remained
impassive
though
he
responded
with
a
faint
gleam
as
walter
looking
back
at
him
produced
for
his
benefit
a
cynical
distortion
of
countenance
which
offered
little
confirmation
of
account
of
things
then
the
door
was
swiftly
opened
to
the
brother
and
sister
and
they
came
into
a
hall
where
a
dozen
sleeked
young
men
lounged
smoked
cigarettes
and
fastened
their
gloves
as
they
waited
for
their
ladies
alice
nodded
to
one
or
another
of
these
and
went
quickly
on
her
face
uplifted
and
smiling
but
walter
detained
her
at
the
door
to
which
she
hastened
listen
here
he
said
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
dance
the
first
dance
with
you
if
you
please
walter
she
said
meekly
how
long
you
goin
to
hang
around
fixin
up
in
that
i
be
out
before
you
ready
yourself
she
promised
him
and
kept
her
word
she
was
so
eager
for
her
good
time
to
begin
when
he
came
for
her
they
went
down
the
hall
to
a
corridor
opening
upon
three
great
rooms
which
had
been
thrown
open
together
with
the
furniture
removed
and
the
broad
floors
waxed
at
one
end
of
the
corridor
musicians
sat
in
a
green
grove
and
walter
with
some
interest
turned
toward
these
but
his
sister
pressing
his
arm
impelled
him
in
the
opposite
direction
what
the
matter
now
he
asked
that
jazz
louie
and
his
bunch
three
white
and
four
mulatto
let
no
no
she
whispered
we
must
speak
to
mildred
and
and
to
i
have
got
a
thing
to
say
to
those
berries
walter
wo
you
please
behave
he
seemed
to
consent
for
the
moment
at
least
and
suffered
her
to
take
him
down
the
corridor
toward
a
floral
bower
where
the
hostess
stood
with
her
father
and
mother
other
couples
and
groups
were
moving
in
the
same
direction
carrying
with
them
a
hubbub
of
laughter
and
fragmentary
chatterings
and
alice
smiling
all
the
time
greeted
people
on
every
side
of
her
eagerly
a
little
more
eagerly
than
most
of
them
responded
while
walter
nodded
in
a
noncommittal
manner
to
one
or
two
said
nothing
and
yawned
audibly
the
last
resource
of
a
person
who
finds
himself
nervous
in
a
false
situation
he
repeated
his
yawn
and
was
beginning
another
when
a
convulsive
pressure
upon
his
arm
made
him
understand
that
he
must
abandon
this
method
of
reassuring
himself
they
were
close
upon
the
floral
bower
mildred
was
giving
her
hand
to
one
and
another
of
her
guests
as
rapidly
as
she
could
passing
them
on
to
her
father
and
mother
and
at
the
same
time
resisting
the
efforts
of
three
or
four
detached
bachelors
who
besought
her
to
give
over
her
duty
in
favour
of
the
just
beginning
to
blare
she
was
a
large
fair
girl
with
a
kindness
of
eye
somewhat
withheld
by
an
expression
of
fastidiousness
at
first
sight
of
her
it
was
clear
that
she
would
never
in
her
life
do
anything
incorrect
or
wear
anything
but
her
correctness
was
of
the
finer
sort
and
had
no
air
of
being
studied
or
achieved
conduct
would
never
offer
her
a
problem
to
be
settled
from
a
book
of
rules
for
the
rules
were
so
deep
within
her
that
she
was
unconscious
of
them
and
behind
this
perfection
there
was
an
even
ampler
perfection
of
what
adams
called
the
big
rich
simple
house
was
part
of
it
and
mildred
father
and
mother
were
part
of
it
they
stood
beside
her
large
serene
people
murmuring
graciously
and
gently
inclining
their
handsome
heads
as
they
gave
their
hands
to
the
guests
and
even
the
youngest
and
most
ebullient
of
these
took
on
a
hushed
mannerliness
with
a
closer
approach
to
the
bower
when
the
opportunity
came
for
alice
and
walter
to
pass
within
this
precinct
alice
going
first
leaned
forward
and
whispered
in
ear
you
did
wear
the
maize
georgette
that
what
i
thought
you
were
going
to
but
you
look
simply
darling
and
those
pearls
others
were
crowding
decorously
forward
anxious
to
be
done
with
ceremony
and
get
to
the
dancing
and
mildred
did
not
prolong
the
intimacy
of
alice
enthusiastic
whispering
with
a
faint
accession
of
colour
and
a
smile
tending
somewhat
in
the
direction
of
rigidity
she
carried
alice
hand
immediately
onward
to
palmer
alice
own
colour
showed
a
little
heightening
as
she
accepted
the
suggestion
thus
implied
nor
was
that
emotional
tint
in
any
wise
decreased
a
moment
later
by
an
impression
that
walter
in
concluding
the
brief
exchange
of
courtesies
between
himself
and
the
stately
palmer
had
again
reassured
himself
with
a
yawn
but
she
did
not
speak
of
it
to
walter
she
preferred
not
to
confirm
the
impression
and
to
leave
in
her
mind
a
possible
doubt
that
he
had
done
it
he
followed
her
out
upon
the
waxed
floor
said
resignedly
well
come
on
put
his
arm
about
her
and
they
began
to
dance
alice
danced
gracefully
and
well
but
not
so
well
as
walter
of
all
the
steps
and
runs
of
all
the
whimsical
turns
and
twirlings
of
all
the
rhythmic
swayings
and
dips
commanded
that
season
by
such
blarings
as
were
the
barbaric
product
loud
and
wild
of
the
jazz
louies
and
their
bunches
the
thin
and
sallow
youth
was
a
master
upon
his
face
could
be
seen
contempt
of
the
easy
marvels
he
performed
as
he
moved
in
swift
precision
from
one
smooth
agility
to
another
and
if
some
or
jealous
cavalier
complained
that
to
be
so
much
a
stylist
in
dancing
was
not
quite
like
a
gentleman
at
least
walter
style
was
what
the
music
called
for
no
other
dancer
in
the
room
could
be
thought
comparable
to
him
alice
told
him
so
it
wonderful
she
said
and
the
mystery
is
where
you
ever
learned
to
do
it
you
never
went
to
but
there
is
a
man
in
the
room
who
can
dance
half
so
well
i
do
see
why
when
you
dance
like
this
you
always
make
such
a
fuss
about
coming
to
he
sounded
his
brief
laugh
a
jeering
bark
out
of
one
side
of
the
mouth
and
swung
her
miraculously
through
a
closing
space
between
two
other
couples
you
know
a
lot
about
what
goes
on
do
you
you
think
there
no
other
place
to
dance
in
this
town
except
these
face
she
echoed
laughing
why
everybody
having
a
splendid
time
look
at
oh
they
holler
loud
enough
he
said
they
do
it
to
make
each
other
think
they
havin
a
good
time
you
do
call
that
palmer
family
berries
i
no
certainly
not
they
just
dignified
and
yeuh
said
walter
they
dignified
when
you
tried
to
whisper
to
mildred
to
show
how
in
with
her
you
were
and
she
moved
you
on
that
way
she
a
hot
friend
is
she
she
did
mean
anything
by
it
she
ole
palmer
a
hearty
slap
ole
berry
walter
interrupted
adding
in
a
casual
tone
all
i
like
i
like
to
hit
walter
by
the
way
you
must
forget
to
ask
mildred
for
a
dance
before
the
evening
is
me
he
produced
the
appearance
of
his
laugh
but
without
making
it
vocal
you
watch
me
do
it
she
probably
wo
have
one
left
but
you
must
ask
her
why
must
i
because
in
the
first
place
you
supposed
to
and
in
the
second
place
she
my
most
intimate
yeuh
is
she
i
heard
you
pull
that
stuff
often
enough
about
her
what
she
ever
do
to
show
she
is
never
mind
you
really
must
ask
her
walter
i
want
you
to
and
i
want
you
to
ask
several
other
girls
afterwhile
i
tell
you
keep
on
wanting
it
do
you
oh
but
you
really
listen
he
said
i
just
as
liable
to
dance
with
any
of
these
fairies
as
i
am
to
buy
a
bucket
o
rusty
tacks
and
eat
forget
it
soon
as
i
get
rid
of
you
i
goin
back
to
that
room
where
i
left
my
hat
and
overcoat
and
smoke
myself
to
well
she
said
a
little
ruefully
as
the
frenzy
of
jazz
louie
and
his
was
suddenly
abated
to
silence
you
must
you
get
rid
of
me
too
soon
they
stood
near
one
of
the
wide
doorways
remaining
where
they
had
stopped
other
couples
everywhere
joined
one
another
forming
vivacious
clusters
but
none
of
these
groups
adopted
the
brother
and
sister
nor
did
any
one
appear
to
be
hurrying
in
alice
direction
to
ask
her
for
the
next
dance
she
looked
about
her
still
maintaining
that
jubilance
of
look
and
manner
she
felt
so
necessary
for
it
is
to
the
girls
who
are
having
a
good
time
that
partners
are
attracted
and
in
order
to
lend
greater
colour
to
her
impersonation
of
a
lively
belle
she
began
to
chatter
loudly
bringing
into
play
an
accompaniment
of
frolicsome
gesture
she
brushed
walter
nose
saucily
with
the
bunch
of
violets
in
her
hand
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
shook
her
pretty
forefinger
in
his
face
flourished
her
arms
kept
her
shoulders
moving
and
laughed
continuously
as
she
spoke
you
naughty
old
walter
she
cried
are
you
ashamed
to
be
such
a
wonderful
dancer
and
then
only
dance
with
your
own
little
sister
you
could
dance
on
the
stage
if
you
wanted
to
why
you
could
made
your
fortune
that
way
why
do
you
would
it
be
just
lovely
to
have
all
the
rows
and
rows
of
people
clapping
their
hands
and
shouting
hurrah
for
walter
adams
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
he
stood
looking
at
her
in
stolid
pity
cut
it
out
he
said
you
better
be
givin
some
of
these
berries
the
eye
so
they
ask
you
to
she
was
not
to
be
so
easily
checked
and
laughed
loudly
flourishing
her
violets
in
his
face
again
you
would
like
it
you
know
you
would
you
need
pretend
just
think
a
whole
big
audience
shouting
hurrah
hur
the
place
be
pulled
if
you
get
any
noisier
he
interrupted
not
ungently
besides
i
no
muley
a
she
laughed
what
on
earth
i
ca
eat
dead
violets
he
explained
so
do
keep
tryin
to
make
me
do
this
had
the
effect
he
desired
and
subdued
her
she
abandoned
her
unsisterly
coquetries
and
looked
beamingly
about
her
but
her
smile
was
more
mechanical
than
it
had
been
at
first
at
home
she
had
seemed
beautiful
but
here
where
the
other
girls
competed
things
were
not
as
they
had
been
there
with
only
her
mother
and
miss
perry
to
give
contrast
these
crowds
of
other
girls
had
all
done
their
best
also
to
look
beautiful
though
not
one
of
them
had
worked
so
hard
for
such
a
consummation
as
alice
had
they
did
not
need
to
they
did
not
need
to
get
their
mothers
to
make
old
dresses
over
they
did
not
need
to
hunt
violets
in
the
rain
at
home
her
dress
had
seemed
beautiful
but
that
was
different
too
where
there
were
dozens
of
brilliant
fabrics
fashioned
in
new
ways
some
of
these
new
ways
startling
which
only
made
the
wearers
centers
of
interest
and
shocked
no
one
and
alice
remembered
that
she
had
heard
a
girl
say
not
long
before
oh
organdie
nobody
wears
organdie
for
evening
gowns
except
in
alice
had
thought
little
of
this
but
as
she
looked
about
her
and
saw
no
organdie
except
her
own
she
found
greater
difficulty
in
keeping
her
smile
as
arch
and
spontaneous
as
she
wished
it
in
fact
it
was
beginning
to
make
her
face
ache
a
little
mildred
came
in
from
the
corridor
heavily
attended
she
carried
a
great
bouquet
of
violets
laced
with
lilies
and
the
violets
were
lusty
big
purple
things
their
stems
wrapped
in
cloth
of
gold
with
silken
cords
dependent
ending
in
long
tassels
she
and
her
convoy
passed
near
the
two
young
adamses
and
it
appeared
that
one
of
the
convoy
besought
his
hostess
to
permit
cutting
in
they
were
doing
it
other
places
of
late
he
urged
but
he
was
denied
and
told
to
console
himself
by
holding
the
bouquet
at
intervals
until
his
third
of
the
sixteenth
dance
should
come
alice
looked
dubiously
at
her
own
bouquet
suddenly
she
felt
that
the
violets
betrayed
her
that
any
one
who
looked
at
them
could
see
how
rustic
how
innocent
of
any
florist
craft
they
were
i
ca
eat
dead
violets
walter
said
the
little
wild
flowers
dying
indeed
in
the
warm
air
were
drooping
in
a
forlorn
mass
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
whoever
noticed
them
would
guess
that
she
had
picked
them
herself
she
decided
to
get
rid
of
them
walter
was
becoming
restive
look
here
he
said
ca
you
flag
one
o
these
birds
to
take
you
on
for
the
next
dance
you
came
to
have
a
good
time
why
do
you
get
busy
and
have
it
i
want
to
get
out
and
you
must
leave
me
walter
she
whispered
hastily
come
for
me
before
long
but
until
they
do
well
could
you
sit
somewhere
no
no
there
is
any
one
i
could
sit
well
why
not
look
at
those
ole
dames
in
the
corners
what
the
matter
your
tyin
up
with
some
o
them
for
a
while
please
walter
no
in
fact
that
indomitable
smile
of
hers
was
the
more
difficult
to
maintain
because
of
these
very
elders
to
whom
walter
referred
they
were
mothers
of
girls
among
the
dancers
and
they
were
there
to
fend
and
contrive
for
their
offspring
to
keep
them
in
countenance
through
any
trial
to
lend
them
diplomacy
in
the
carrying
out
of
all
enterprises
to
be
background
for
them
and
in
these
essentially
biological
functionings
to
imitate
their
own
matings
and
renew
the
excitement
of
their
nuptial
periods
older
men
husbands
of
these
ladies
and
fathers
of
eligible
girls
were
also
to
be
seen
most
of
them
with
palmer
in
a
across
the
corridor
and
adams
had
not
been
invited
of
course
papa
and
mama
just
barely
know
mildred
palmer
alice
thought
and
most
of
the
other
girls
fathers
and
mothers
are
old
friends
of
and
palmer
but
i
do
think
she
might
have
asked
papa
and
mama
anyway
she
need
have
been
afraid
just
to
ask
them
she
knew
they
could
and
her
smiling
lip
twitched
a
little
threateningly
as
she
concluded
the
silent
monologue
i
suppose
she
thinks
i
ought
to
be
glad
enough
she
asked
walter
walter
was
in
fact
rather
noticeable
he
was
not
mildred
only
guest
to
wear
a
short
coat
and
to
appear
without
gloves
but
he
was
singular
at
least
in
his
present
surroundings
on
account
of
a
kind
of
coiffuring
he
favoured
his
hair
having
been
shaped
after
what
seemed
a
mongol
inspiration
only
upon
the
top
of
the
head
was
actual
hair
perceived
the
rest
appearing
to
be
nudity
and
even
more
than
by
any
difference
in
mode
he
was
set
apart
by
his
look
and
manner
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
a
brooding
secretive
and
jeering
superiority
and
this
was
most
vividly
expressed
when
he
felt
called
upon
for
his
loud
short
laugh
whenever
he
uttered
it
alice
laughed
too
as
loudly
as
she
could
to
cover
it
well
he
said
how
long
we
goin
to
stand
here
my
feet
are
alice
took
his
arm
and
they
began
to
walk
aimlessly
through
the
rooms
though
she
tried
to
look
as
if
they
had
a
definite
destination
keeping
her
eyes
eager
and
her
lips
parted
people
had
called
jovially
to
them
from
the
distance
she
meant
to
imply
and
they
were
going
to
join
these
merry
friends
she
was
still
upon
this
ghostly
errand
when
a
furious
outbreak
of
drums
and
saxophones
sounded
a
prelude
for
the
second
dance
walter
danced
with
her
again
but
he
gave
her
a
warning
i
do
want
to
leave
you
high
and
dry
he
told
her
but
i
ca
stand
it
i
got
to
get
somewhere
i
do
haf
to
hurt
my
eyes
with
these
berries
i
go
blind
if
i
got
to
look
at
any
more
of
i
goin
out
to
smoke
as
soon
as
the
music
begins
the
next
time
and
you
better
get
fixed
for
alice
tried
to
get
fixed
for
it
as
they
danced
she
nodded
sunnily
to
every
man
whose
eye
she
caught
smiled
her
smile
with
the
under
lip
caught
between
her
teeth
but
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
intermission
after
the
dance
that
she
saw
help
coming
across
the
room
sat
the
globular
lady
she
had
encountered
that
morning
and
beside
the
globular
lady
sat
a
girl
her
daughter
at
first
glance
the
family
contour
was
also
as
evident
a
characteristic
of
the
short
young
man
who
stood
in
front
of
dowling
engaged
with
her
in
a
discussion
which
was
not
without
evidences
of
an
earnestness
almost
impassioned
like
walter
he
was
declining
to
dance
a
third
time
with
sister
he
wished
to
go
elsewhere
alice
from
a
sidelong
eye
watched
the
controversy
she
saw
the
globular
young
man
glance
toward
her
over
his
shoulder
whereupon
dowling
following
this
glance
gave
alice
a
look
of
open
fury
became
much
more
vehement
in
the
argument
and
even
struck
her
knee
with
a
round
fat
fist
for
emphasis
i
on
my
way
said
walter
there
the
music
startin
up
again
and
i
told
you
she
nodded
gratefully
it
all
right
but
come
back
before
long
the
globular
young
man
red
with
annoyance
had
torn
himself
from
his
family
and
was
hastening
across
the
room
to
her
i
have
this
dance
why
you
nice
frank
dowling
alice
cried
how
lovely
chapter
vii
they
danced
dowling
should
have
found
other
forms
of
exercise
and
pastime
nature
has
not
designed
everyone
for
dancing
though
sometimes
those
she
has
denied
are
the
last
to
discover
her
niggardliness
but
the
round
young
man
was
at
least
vigorous
enough
too
much
so
when
his
knees
collided
with
alice
and
he
was
too
sturdy
to
be
thrown
off
his
feet
himself
or
to
allow
his
partner
to
fall
when
he
tripped
her
he
held
her
up
valiantly
and
continued
to
beat
a
path
through
the
crowd
of
other
dancers
by
main
force
he
paid
no
attention
to
anything
suggested
by
the
efforts
of
the
musicians
and
appeared
to
be
unaware
that
there
should
have
been
some
connection
between
what
they
were
doing
and
what
he
was
doing
but
he
may
have
listened
to
other
music
of
his
own
for
his
expression
was
of
high
content
he
seemed
to
feel
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
was
dancing
alice
kept
as
far
away
from
him
as
under
the
circumstances
she
could
and
when
they
stopped
she
glanced
down
and
found
the
execution
of
unseen
manoeuvres
within
the
protection
of
her
skirt
helpful
to
one
of
her
insteps
and
to
the
toes
of
both
of
her
slippers
her
cheery
partner
was
paddling
his
rosy
brows
with
a
fine
handkerchief
that
was
great
he
said
let
go
out
and
sit
in
the
corridor
they
got
some
comfortable
chairs
out
well
let
not
she
returned
i
believe
i
rather
stay
in
here
and
look
at
the
no
that
is
it
he
said
chiding
her
with
a
waggish
forefinger
you
think
if
you
go
out
there
you
miss
a
chance
of
someone
else
asking
you
for
the
next
dance
and
so
you
have
to
give
it
to
how
absurd
then
after
a
look
about
her
that
revealed
nothing
encouraging
she
added
graciously
you
can
have
the
next
if
you
want
great
he
exclaimed
mechanically
now
let
get
out
of
here
out
of
this
room
why
what
the
matter
with
my
mother
dowling
explained
but
do
look
at
her
she
keeps
motioning
me
to
come
and
see
after
ella
and
i
simply
not
going
to
do
it
you
see
alice
laughed
i
do
believe
it
so
much
that
she
said
and
consented
to
walk
with
him
to
a
point
in
the
next
room
from
which
dowling
continuous
signalling
could
not
be
seen
your
mother
hates
oh
no
i
would
say
that
no
she
do
he
protested
innocently
she
do
know
you
more
than
just
to
speak
to
you
see
so
how
could
she
well
she
does
i
can
a
frown
appeared
upon
his
rounded
brow
no
i
tell
you
the
way
she
feels
it
like
this
ella
is
too
popular
you
know
it
hard
to
see
why
because
she
a
right
nice
girl
in
her
way
and
mother
thinks
i
ought
to
look
after
her
you
see
she
thinks
i
ought
to
dance
a
whole
lot
with
her
myself
and
stir
up
other
fellows
to
dance
with
her
simply
impossible
to
make
mother
understand
you
ca
do
that
you
see
and
then
about
me
you
see
if
she
had
her
way
i
would
get
to
dance
with
anybody
at
all
except
girls
like
mildred
palmer
and
henrietta
lamb
mother
wants
to
run
my
whole
programme
for
me
you
understand
but
the
trouble
of
it
is
about
girls
like
that
you
see
well
i
could
do
what
she
wants
even
if
i
wanted
to
myself
because
you
take
those
girls
and
by
the
time
i
get
ella
off
my
hands
for
a
minute
why
their
dances
are
always
every
last
one
taken
and
where
do
i
come
in
alice
nodded
her
amiability
undamaged
i
see
so
that
why
you
dance
with
no
i
like
to
he
protested
i
rather
dance
with
you
than
i
do
with
those
and
he
added
with
a
retrospective
determination
which
showed
that
he
had
been
through
quite
an
experience
with
dowling
in
this
matter
i
told
mother
i
would
too
did
it
take
all
your
courage
frank
he
looked
at
her
shrewdly
now
you
trying
to
tease
me
he
said
i
do
care
i
would
rather
dance
with
you
in
the
first
place
a
perfectly
beautiful
dancer
you
see
and
in
the
second
a
man
feels
a
lot
more
comfortable
with
you
than
he
does
with
them
of
course
i
know
almost
all
the
other
fellows
get
along
with
those
girls
all
right
but
i
do
waste
any
time
on
i
do
have
to
like
people
that
are
always
cordial
to
everybody
you
see
the
way
you
thank
you
she
said
thoughtfully
oh
i
mean
it
he
insisted
there
goes
the
band
again
shall
we
suppose
we
sit
it
out
she
suggested
i
believe
i
like
to
go
out
in
the
corridor
after
all
it
pretty
warm
in
assenting
cheerfully
dowling
conducted
her
to
a
pair
of
within
a
secluding
grove
of
and
when
they
came
to
this
retreat
they
found
mildred
palmer
just
departing
under
escort
of
a
gentleman
about
thirty
as
these
two
walked
slowly
away
in
the
direction
of
the
they
left
it
not
to
be
doubted
that
they
were
on
excellent
terms
with
each
other
mildred
was
evidently
willing
to
make
their
progress
even
slower
for
she
halted
momentarily
once
or
twice
and
her
upward
glances
to
her
tall
companion
face
were
of
a
gentle
almost
blushing
deference
never
before
had
alice
seen
anything
like
this
in
her
friend
manner
how
queer
she
murmured
what
queer
dowling
inquired
as
they
sat
down
who
was
that
man
have
you
met
him
i
never
saw
him
before
who
is
he
why
it
this
arthur
what
arthur
russell
i
never
heard
of
dowling
was
puzzled
why
that
funny
only
the
last
time
i
saw
you
you
were
telling
me
how
awfully
well
you
knew
mildred
why
certainly
i
do
alice
informed
him
she
my
most
intimate
that
what
makes
it
seem
so
funny
you
have
heard
anything
about
this
russell
because
everybody
says
even
if
she
is
engaged
to
him
right
now
she
most
likely
will
be
before
very
long
i
must
say
it
looks
a
good
deal
that
way
to
me
what
nonsense
alice
exclaimed
she
never
even
mentioned
him
to
the
young
man
glanced
at
her
dubiously
and
passed
a
finger
over
the
tiny
prong
that
dashingly
composed
the
whole
substance
of
his
moustache
well
you
see
mildred
is
pretty
reserved
he
remarked
this
russell
is
some
kind
of
cousin
of
the
palmer
family
i
he
is
yes
second
or
third
or
something
the
girls
say
you
see
my
sister
ella
has
got
much
to
do
at
home
and
do
read
anything
or
sew
or
play
solitaire
you
see
and
she
hears
about
pretty
much
everything
that
goes
on
you
see
well
ella
says
a
lot
of
the
girls
have
been
talking
about
mildred
and
this
arthur
russell
for
quite
a
while
back
you
see
they
were
all
wondering
what
he
was
going
to
look
like
you
see
because
he
only
got
here
yesterday
and
that
proves
she
must
have
been
talking
to
some
of
or
else
how
alice
laughed
airily
but
the
pretty
sound
ended
abruptly
with
an
audible
intake
of
breath
of
course
while
mildred
is
my
most
intimate
friend
she
said
i
do
mean
she
tells
me
everything
and
naturally
she
has
other
friends
besides
what
else
did
your
sister
say
she
told
them
about
this
russell
well
it
seems
he
very
well
off
at
least
henrietta
lamb
told
ella
he
was
ella
says
alice
interrupted
again
with
an
increased
irritability
oh
never
mind
what
ella
says
let
find
something
better
to
talk
about
than
russell
well
i
willing
dowling
assented
ruefully
what
you
want
to
talk
about
but
this
liberal
offer
found
her
unresponsive
she
sat
leaning
back
silent
her
arms
along
the
arms
of
her
chair
and
her
eyes
moist
and
bright
fixed
upon
a
wide
doorway
where
the
dancers
fluctuated
she
was
disquieted
by
more
than
mildred
reserve
though
reserve
so
marked
had
certainly
the
significance
of
a
warning
that
alice
definition
my
most
intimate
friend
lacked
sanction
indirect
notice
to
this
effect
could
not
well
have
been
more
emphatic
but
the
sting
of
it
was
left
for
a
later
moment
something
else
preoccupied
alice
she
had
just
been
surprised
by
an
odd
experience
at
first
sight
of
this
arthur
russell
she
had
said
to
herself
instantly
in
words
as
definite
as
if
she
spoke
them
aloud
though
they
seemed
more
like
words
spoken
to
her
by
some
unknown
person
within
her
there
that
exactly
the
kind
of
looking
man
i
like
to
marry
in
the
eyes
of
the
restless
and
the
longing
providence
often
appears
to
be
worse
than
inscrutable
an
unreliable
omnipotence
given
to
haphazard
whimsies
in
dealing
with
its
own
creatures
choosing
at
random
some
among
them
to
be
rent
with
tragic
deprivations
and
others
to
be
petted
with
blessing
upon
blessing
in
alice
eyes
mildred
had
been
blessed
enough
something
ought
to
be
left
over
by
this
time
for
another
girl
the
final
touch
to
the
heaping
perfection
of
for
mildred
was
that
this
arthur
russell
graceful
the
perfect
fiance
should
be
also
very
well
of
course
these
rich
always
married
one
another
and
while
the
mildreds
danced
with
their
arthur
russells
the
best
an
outsider
could
do
for
herself
was
to
sit
with
frank
dowling
the
one
last
course
left
her
that
was
better
than
dancing
with
him
well
what
do
you
want
to
talk
about
he
inquired
nothing
she
said
suppose
we
just
sit
but
a
moment
later
she
remembered
something
and
with
a
sudden
animation
began
to
prattle
she
pointed
to
the
musicians
down
the
corridor
oh
look
at
them
look
at
the
leader
are
they
funny
someone
told
me
called
louie
and
his
bunch
is
that
just
crazy
do
you
love
it
do
watch
them
she
continued
to
chatter
and
while
thus
keeping
his
glance
away
from
herself
she
detached
the
forlorn
bouquet
of
dead
violets
from
her
dress
and
laid
it
gently
beside
the
one
she
had
carried
the
latter
already
reposed
in
the
obscurity
selected
for
it
at
the
base
of
one
of
the
then
she
was
abruptly
silent
you
certainly
are
a
funny
girl
dowling
remarked
you
say
you
want
to
talk
about
anything
at
all
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
break
out
and
talk
a
blue
streak
and
just
about
the
time
i
begin
to
get
interested
in
what
you
saying
you
shut
off
what
the
matter
with
girls
anyhow
when
they
do
things
like
that
i
do
know
we
just
queer
i
i
say
so
well
what
we
do
now
talk
or
just
sit
suppose
we
just
sit
some
anything
to
oblige
he
assented
i
willing
to
sit
as
long
as
you
but
even
as
he
made
his
amiability
clear
in
this
matter
the
peace
was
threatened
his
mother
came
down
the
corridor
like
a
rolling
ominous
cloud
she
was
looking
about
her
on
all
sides
in
a
fidget
of
annoyance
searching
for
him
and
to
his
dismay
she
saw
him
she
immediately
made
a
horrible
face
at
his
companion
beckoned
to
him
imperiously
with
a
dumpy
arm
and
shook
her
head
reprovingly
the
unfortunate
young
man
tried
to
repulse
her
with
an
icy
stare
but
this
effort
having
obtained
little
to
encourage
his
feeble
hope
of
driving
her
away
he
shifted
his
chair
so
that
his
back
was
toward
her
discomfiting
pantomime
he
should
have
known
better
the
instant
result
was
dowling
in
motion
at
an
impetuous
waddle
she
entered
the
seclusion
with
the
lower
rotundities
of
her
face
hastily
modelled
into
the
resemblance
of
an
smile
a
contortion
which
neglected
to
spread
its
intended
geniality
upward
to
the
exasperated
eyes
and
anxious
forehead
i
think
your
mother
wants
to
speak
to
you
frank
alice
said
upon
this
advent
dowling
nodded
to
her
good
evening
miss
adams
she
said
i
just
thought
as
you
and
frank
were
dancing
you
would
mind
my
disturbing
you
not
at
all
alice
murmured
dowling
seemed
of
a
different
mind
well
what
do
you
want
he
inquired
whereupon
his
mother
struck
him
roguishly
with
her
fan
bad
fellow
she
turned
to
alice
i
sure
you
wo
mind
excusing
him
to
let
him
do
something
for
his
old
mother
miss
what
do
you
want
the
son
repeated
two
very
nice
things
dowling
informed
him
everybody
is
so
anxious
for
henrietta
lamb
to
have
a
pleasant
evening
because
it
the
very
first
time
she
been
anywhere
since
her
father
death
and
of
course
her
dear
grandfather
an
old
friend
of
ours
and
well
well
her
son
interrupted
miss
adams
is
interested
in
all
this
but
henrietta
came
to
speak
to
ella
and
me
and
i
told
her
you
were
so
anxious
to
dance
with
her
here
he
cried
look
here
i
rather
do
my
own
yes
that
just
it
dowling
explained
i
just
thought
it
was
such
a
good
opportunity
and
henrietta
said
she
had
most
of
her
dances
taken
but
she
give
you
one
if
you
asked
her
before
they
were
all
gone
so
i
thought
you
better
see
her
as
soon
as
dowling
face
had
become
rosy
i
refuse
to
do
anything
of
the
bad
fellow
said
his
mother
gaily
i
thought
this
would
be
the
best
time
for
you
to
see
henrietta
because
it
wo
be
long
till
all
her
dances
are
gone
and
you
promised
on
your
word
to
dance
the
next
with
ella
and
you
might
have
a
chance
to
do
it
then
i
sure
miss
adams
wo
mind
if
you
not
at
all
alice
said
well
mind
he
said
i
wish
you
could
understand
that
when
i
want
to
dance
with
any
girl
i
do
need
my
mother
to
ask
her
for
me
i
really
am
more
than
six
years
old
he
spoke
with
too
much
vehemence
and
dowling
at
once
saw
how
to
have
her
way
as
with
husbands
and
wives
so
with
many
fathers
and
daughters
and
so
with
some
sons
and
mothers
the
man
will
himself
be
cross
in
public
and
think
nothing
of
it
nor
will
he
greatly
mind
a
little
crossness
on
the
part
of
the
woman
but
let
her
show
agitation
before
any
spectator
he
is
instantly
reduced
to
a
coward
slavery
women
understand
that
ancient
weakness
of
course
for
it
is
one
of
their
most
important
means
of
defense
but
can
be
used
ignobly
dowling
permitted
a
tremulousness
to
become
audible
in
her
voice
it
is
very
very
pleasant
to
be
talked
to
like
that
by
your
own
son
before
strangers
oh
my
look
here
the
stricken
dowling
protested
say
anything
mother
i
was
just
joking
about
how
you
never
get
over
thinking
i
a
little
boy
i
only
dowling
continued
i
just
thought
i
was
doing
you
a
little
favour
i
did
think
it
would
make
you
so
mother
for
goodness
sake
miss
adams
think
i
suppose
dowling
interrupted
piteously
i
suppose
it
matter
what
think
oh
gracious
alice
interfered
she
perceived
that
the
ruthless
dowling
meant
to
have
her
way
i
think
you
better
go
frank
there
his
mother
cried
miss
adams
says
so
herself
what
more
do
you
want
oh
gracious
he
lamented
again
and
with
a
sick
look
over
his
shoulder
at
alice
permitted
his
mother
to
take
his
arm
and
propel
him
away
dowling
spirits
had
strikingly
recovered
even
before
the
pair
passed
from
the
corridor
she
moved
almost
bouncingly
beside
her
embittered
son
and
her
eyes
and
all
the
convolutions
of
her
abundant
face
were
blithe
alice
went
in
search
of
walter
but
without
much
hope
of
finding
him
what
he
did
with
himself
at
dances
was
one
of
his
most
successful
mysteries
and
her
present
excursion
gave
her
no
clue
leading
to
its
solution
when
the
musicians
again
lowered
their
instruments
for
an
interval
she
had
returned
alone
to
her
former
seat
within
the
partial
shelter
of
the
she
had
now
to
practice
an
art
that
affords
but
a
limited
variety
of
methods
even
to
the
expert
the
art
of
seeming
to
have
an
escort
or
partner
when
there
is
none
the
practitioner
must
imply
merely
by
expression
and
attitude
that
the
supposed
companion
has
left
her
for
only
a
few
moments
that
she
herself
has
sent
him
upon
an
errand
and
if
possible
the
minds
of
observers
must
be
directed
toward
a
conclusion
that
this
errand
of
her
devising
is
an
amusing
one
at
all
events
she
is
alone
temporarily
and
of
choice
not
deserted
she
awaits
a
devoted
man
who
may
return
at
any
instant
other
people
desired
to
sit
in
alice
nook
but
discovered
her
in
occupancy
she
had
moved
the
vacant
chair
closer
to
her
own
and
she
sat
with
her
arm
extended
so
that
her
hand
holding
her
lace
kerchief
rested
upon
the
back
of
this
second
chair
claiming
it
such
a
preemption
like
that
of
a
traveller
bag
in
the
rack
was
unquestionable
and
for
additional
evidence
sitting
with
her
knees
crossed
she
kept
one
foot
continuously
moving
a
little
in
cadence
with
the
other
which
tapped
the
floor
moreover
she
added
a
fine
detail
her
with
the
under
lip
caught
seemed
to
struggle
against
repression
as
if
she
found
the
service
engaging
her
absent
companion
even
more
amusing
than
she
would
let
him
see
when
he
returned
there
was
jovial
intrigue
of
some
sort
afoot
evidently
her
eyes
beaming
with
secret
fun
were
averted
from
intruders
but
sometimes
when
couples
approached
seeking
possession
of
the
nook
her
thoughts
about
the
absentee
appeared
to
threaten
her
with
outright
laughter
and
though
one
or
two
girls
looked
at
her
skeptically
as
they
turned
away
their
escorts
felt
no
such
doubts
and
merely
wondered
what
importantly
funny
affair
alice
adams
was
engaged
in
she
had
learned
to
do
it
perfectly
she
had
learned
it
during
the
last
two
years
she
was
twenty
when
for
the
first
time
she
had
the
shock
of
finding
herself
without
an
applicant
for
one
of
her
dances
when
she
was
sixteen
all
the
nice
boys
in
town
as
her
mother
said
crowded
the
adamses
small
veranda
and
steps
or
sat
near
by
on
the
lawn
on
summer
evenings
and
at
eighteen
she
had
replaced
the
boys
with
the
older
by
this
time
most
of
the
other
girls
her
contemporaries
were
away
at
school
or
college
and
when
they
came
home
to
stay
they
came
out
that
feeble
revival
of
an
ancient
custom
offering
the
maiden
to
the
ceremonial
inspection
of
the
tribe
alice
neither
went
away
nor
came
out
and
in
contrast
with
those
who
did
she
may
have
seemed
to
lack
freshness
of
lustre
jewels
are
richest
when
revealed
all
new
in
a
white
velvet
box
and
alice
may
have
been
too
eager
to
secure
new
retainers
too
kind
in
her
efforts
to
keep
the
old
ones
she
had
been
a
belle
too
soon
chapter
viii
the
device
of
the
absentee
partner
has
the
defect
that
it
can
not
be
employed
for
longer
than
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
at
a
time
and
it
may
not
be
repeated
more
than
twice
in
one
evening
a
single
repetition
indeed
is
weak
and
may
prove
a
betrayal
alice
knew
that
her
present
performance
could
be
effective
during
only
this
interval
between
dances
and
though
her
eyes
were
guarded
she
anxiously
counted
over
the
partnerless
young
men
who
lounged
together
in
the
doorways
within
her
view
every
one
of
them
ought
to
have
asked
her
for
dances
she
thought
and
although
she
might
have
been
put
to
it
to
give
a
reason
why
any
of
them
ought
her
heart
was
hot
with
resentment
against
them
for
a
girl
who
has
been
a
belle
it
is
harder
to
live
through
these
bad
times
than
it
is
for
one
who
has
never
known
anything
better
like
a
figure
of
painted
and
brightly
varnished
wood
ella
dowling
sat
against
the
wall
through
dance
after
dance
with
glassy
imperturbability
it
was
easier
to
be
wooden
alice
thought
if
you
had
your
mother
with
you
as
ella
had
you
were
left
with
at
least
the
shred
of
a
pretense
that
you
came
to
sit
with
your
mother
as
a
spectator
and
not
to
offer
yourself
to
be
danced
with
by
men
who
looked
you
over
and
rejected
you
not
for
the
first
time
not
for
the
first
time
there
lay
a
sting
why
had
you
thought
this
time
might
be
different
from
the
other
times
why
had
you
broken
your
back
picking
those
hundreds
of
violets
hating
the
fatuous
young
men
in
the
doorways
more
bitterly
for
every
instant
that
she
had
to
maintain
her
tableau
the
smiling
alice
knew
fierce
impulses
to
spring
to
her
feet
and
shout
at
them
you
idiots
hands
in
pockets
they
lounged
against
the
pilasters
or
faced
one
another
laughing
vaguely
each
one
of
them
seeming
to
alice
no
more
than
so
much
mean
beef
in
clothes
she
wanted
to
tell
them
they
were
no
better
than
that
and
it
seemed
a
cruel
thing
of
heaven
to
let
them
go
on
believing
themselves
young
lords
they
were
doing
nothing
killing
time
was
she
at
her
lowest
value
at
least
a
means
of
killing
time
evidently
the
mean
beeves
thought
not
and
when
one
of
them
finally
lounged
across
the
corridor
and
spoke
to
her
he
was
the
very
one
to
whom
she
preferred
her
loneliness
waiting
for
somebody
lady
alicia
he
asked
negligently
and
his
easy
burlesque
of
her
name
was
like
the
familiarity
of
the
rest
of
him
he
was
one
of
those
grossly
handsome
men
who
are
powerful
and
active
but
never
submit
themselves
to
the
rigour
of
becoming
athletes
though
they
shoot
and
fish
from
expensive
camps
gloss
is
the
most
shining
outward
mark
of
the
type
nowadays
these
men
no
longer
use
brilliantine
on
their
moustaches
but
they
have
gloss
bought
from
from
masseurs
and
from
and
their
eyes
usually
large
are
glossy
none
of
this
is
allowed
to
interfere
with
business
these
are
good
business
men
and
often
make
large
fortunes
they
are
men
of
imagination
about
two
things
women
and
money
and
combining
their
imaginings
about
both
usually
make
a
wise
first
marriage
later
however
they
are
apt
to
imagine
too
much
about
some
little
woman
without
whom
life
seems
duller
than
need
be
they
run
away
leaving
the
first
wife
well
enough
dowered
they
are
never
intentionally
unkind
to
women
and
in
the
end
they
usually
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
they
have
had
their
money
worth
of
life
here
was
harvey
malone
a
young
specimen
in
an
earlier
stage
of
development
trying
to
marry
henrietta
lamb
and
now
sauntering
over
to
speak
to
alice
as
a
before
his
next
dance
with
henrietta
alice
made
no
response
to
his
question
and
he
dropped
lazily
into
the
vacant
chair
from
which
she
sharply
withdrew
her
hand
i
might
as
well
use
his
chair
till
he
comes
do
you
think
you
do
mind
do
you
old
girl
oh
no
alice
said
it
does
matter
one
way
or
the
other
please
do
call
me
so
that
how
you
feel
malone
laughed
indulgently
without
much
interest
i
been
meaning
to
come
to
see
you
for
a
long
time
honestly
i
have
because
i
wanted
to
have
a
good
talk
with
you
about
old
times
i
know
you
think
it
was
funny
after
the
way
i
used
to
come
to
your
house
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
sometimes
oftener
well
i
do
blame
you
for
being
hurt
the
way
i
stopped
without
explaining
or
anything
the
truth
is
there
was
any
reason
i
just
happened
to
have
a
lot
of
important
things
to
do
and
could
find
the
time
but
i
am
going
to
call
on
you
some
evening
honestly
i
am
i
do
wonder
you
think
you
mistaken
alice
said
i
never
thought
anything
about
it
at
well
well
he
said
and
looked
at
her
languidly
what
the
use
of
being
cross
with
this
old
man
he
always
means
and
extending
his
arm
he
would
have
given
her
a
friendly
pat
upon
the
shoulder
but
she
evaded
it
well
well
he
said
seems
to
me
you
getting
awful
tetchy
do
you
like
your
old
friends
any
more
not
all
of
who
the
new
one
he
asked
teasingly
come
on
and
tell
us
alice
who
is
it
you
were
holding
this
chair
for
never
well
all
i
got
to
do
is
to
sit
here
till
he
comes
back
then
see
who
it
he
may
not
come
back
before
you
have
to
guess
you
got
me
that
time
malone
admitted
laughing
as
he
rose
they
tuning
up
and
i
got
this
dance
i
am
coming
around
to
see
you
some
he
moved
away
calling
back
over
his
shoulder
honestly
i
am
alice
did
not
look
at
him
she
had
held
her
tableau
as
long
as
she
could
it
was
time
for
her
to
abandon
the
and
she
stepped
forth
frowning
as
if
a
little
annoyed
with
the
absentee
for
being
such
a
time
upon
her
errand
whereupon
the
two
chairs
were
instantly
seized
by
a
coquetting
pair
who
intended
to
sit
out
the
dance
she
walked
quickly
down
the
broad
corridor
turned
into
the
broader
hall
and
hurriedly
entered
the
where
she
had
left
her
wraps
she
stayed
here
as
long
as
she
could
pretending
to
arrange
her
hair
at
a
mirror
then
fidgeting
with
one
of
her
but
the
intelligent
elderly
woman
in
charge
of
the
room
made
an
indefinite
sojourn
impracticable
perhaps
i
could
help
you
with
that
buckle
miss
she
suggested
approaching
has
it
come
loose
alice
wrenched
desperately
then
it
was
loose
the
competent
woman
producing
needle
and
thread
deftly
made
the
buckle
fast
and
there
was
nothing
for
alice
to
do
but
to
express
her
gratitude
and
go
she
went
to
the
door
of
the
opposite
where
a
coloured
man
stood
watchfully
in
the
doorway
i
wonder
if
you
know
which
of
the
gentlemen
is
my
brother
walter
adams
she
said
yes
i
know
could
you
tell
me
where
he
is
no
i
could
well
if
you
see
him
would
you
please
tell
him
that
his
sister
miss
adams
is
looking
for
him
and
very
anxious
to
speak
to
him
yes
as
she
went
away
he
stared
after
her
and
seemed
to
swell
with
some
bursting
emotion
in
fact
it
was
too
much
for
him
and
he
suddenly
retired
within
the
room
releasing
strangulated
laughter
walter
remonstrated
behind
an
excellent
screen
of
coats
and
hats
in
a
remote
part
of
the
room
he
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
engaged
in
a
game
of
chance
with
a
second
coloured
attendant
and
the
laughter
became
so
vehement
that
it
not
only
interfered
with
the
pastime
in
hand
but
threatened
to
attract
attention
i
cain
it
man
the
laughter
explained
i
cain
it
you
the
white
boy
city
the
dancers
were
swinging
into
an
encore
as
alice
halted
for
an
irresolute
moment
in
a
doorway
across
the
room
a
cluster
of
matrons
sat
chatting
absently
their
eyes
on
their
dancing
daughters
and
alice
finding
a
refugee
courage
dodged
through
the
scurrying
couples
seated
herself
in
a
chair
on
the
outskirts
of
this
colony
of
elders
and
began
to
talk
eagerly
to
the
matron
nearest
her
the
matron
seemed
unaccustomed
to
so
much
vivacity
and
responded
but
dryly
whereupon
alice
was
more
vivacious
than
ever
for
she
meant
now
to
present
the
picture
of
a
jolly
girl
too
much
interested
in
these
wise
older
women
to
bother
about
every
foolish
young
man
who
asked
her
for
a
dance
her
matron
was
constrained
to
go
so
far
as
to
supply
a
tolerant
nod
now
and
then
in
complement
to
the
girl
animation
and
alice
was
grateful
for
the
nods
in
this
fashion
she
supplemented
the
exhausted
resources
of
the
and
the
nook
and
lived
through
two
more
dances
when
again
frank
dowling
presented
himself
as
a
partner
she
needed
no
pretense
to
seek
the
for
repairs
after
that
number
this
time
they
were
necessary
and
genuine
dowling
waited
for
her
and
when
she
came
out
he
explained
for
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
how
the
accident
had
happened
it
was
entirely
those
other
people
fault
he
said
they
got
me
in
a
kind
of
a
corner
because
neither
of
those
fellows
knows
the
least
thing
about
guiding
they
just
jam
ahead
and
expect
everybody
to
get
out
of
their
way
it
was
charlotte
diamond
crescent
pin
that
got
caught
on
your
dress
in
the
back
and
made
such
a
never
mind
alice
said
in
a
tired
voice
the
maid
fixed
it
so
that
she
says
it
is
very
well
it
is
he
returned
you
could
hardly
tell
there
been
anything
the
matter
where
do
you
want
to
go
mother
been
interfering
in
my
affairs
some
more
and
i
got
the
next
i
was
sitting
with
george
dresser
you
might
take
me
back
he
left
her
with
the
matron
and
alice
returned
to
her
so
that
once
more
while
two
numbers
passed
whoever
cared
to
look
was
offered
the
sketch
of
a
jolly
clever
girl
preoccupied
with
her
elders
then
she
found
her
friend
mildred
standing
before
her
presenting
arthur
russell
who
asked
her
to
dance
with
him
alice
looked
uncertain
as
though
not
sure
what
her
engagements
were
but
her
perplexity
cleared
she
nodded
and
swung
rhythmically
away
with
the
tall
applicant
she
was
not
grateful
to
her
hostess
for
this
alms
what
a
young
hostess
does
with
a
fiance
alice
thought
is
to
make
him
dance
with
the
unpopular
girls
she
supposed
that
arthur
russell
had
already
danced
with
ella
dowling
the
loan
of
a
lover
under
these
circumstances
may
be
painful
to
the
lessee
and
alice
smiling
never
more
brightly
found
nothing
to
say
to
russell
though
she
thought
he
might
have
found
something
to
say
to
her
i
wonder
what
mildred
told
him
she
thought
probably
she
said
there
one
more
girl
you
got
to
help
me
out
with
you
would
like
her
much
but
she
dances
well
enough
and
she
having
a
rotten
time
nobody
ever
goes
near
her
any
more
when
the
music
stopped
russell
added
his
applause
to
the
that
encouraged
the
uproarious
instruments
to
continue
and
as
they
renewed
the
tumult
he
said
heartily
that
splendid
alice
gave
him
a
glance
necessarily
at
short
range
and
found
his
eyes
kindly
and
pleased
here
was
a
friendly
soul
it
appeared
who
probably
liked
no
doubt
he
had
applauded
for
an
encore
when
he
danced
with
ella
dowling
gave
ella
the
same
genial
look
and
said
that
splendid
when
the
encore
was
over
alice
spoke
to
him
for
the
first
time
mildred
will
be
looking
for
you
she
said
i
think
you
better
take
me
back
to
where
you
found
he
looked
surprised
oh
if
you
i
sure
mildred
will
be
needing
you
alice
said
and
as
she
took
his
arm
and
they
walked
toward
dresser
she
thought
it
might
be
just
possible
to
make
a
further
use
of
the
loan
oh
i
wonder
if
you
she
began
yes
he
said
quickly
you
do
know
my
brother
walter
adams
she
said
but
he
somewhere
i
think
possibly
he
in
a
or
some
place
where
girls
expected
and
if
you
would
think
it
too
much
trouble
to
inquire
i
find
him
russell
said
promptly
thank
you
so
much
for
that
dance
i
bring
your
brother
in
a
it
was
to
be
a
long
moment
alice
decided
presently
dresser
had
grown
restive
and
her
nods
and
vague
responses
to
her
young
gaieties
were
as
meager
as
they
could
well
be
evidently
the
matron
had
no
intention
of
appearing
to
her
world
in
the
light
of
a
chaperone
for
alice
adams
and
she
finally
made
this
clear
with
a
word
or
two
of
excuse
breaking
into
something
alice
was
saying
she
rose
and
went
to
sit
next
to
mildred
mother
who
had
become
the
nucleus
of
the
cluster
so
alice
was
left
very
much
against
the
wall
with
short
stretches
of
vacant
chairs
on
each
side
of
her
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
and
could
only
pretend
that
there
was
something
amusing
the
matter
with
the
arm
of
her
chair
she
supposed
that
mildred
russell
had
forgotten
walter
by
this
time
i
not
even
an
intimate
enough
friend
of
mildred
for
him
to
have
thought
he
ought
to
bother
to
tell
me
he
could
find
him
she
thought
and
then
she
saw
russell
coming
across
the
room
toward
her
with
walter
beside
him
she
jumped
up
gaily
oh
thank
you
she
cried
i
know
this
naughty
boy
must
have
been
terribly
hard
to
find
mildred
never
forgive
me
i
put
you
to
so
much
not
at
all
he
said
amiably
and
went
away
leaving
the
brother
and
sister
together
walter
let
dance
just
once
more
alice
said
touching
his
arm
placatively
i
thought
well
perhaps
we
might
go
home
but
walter
expression
was
that
of
a
person
upon
whom
an
outrage
has
just
been
perpetrated
no
he
said
we
stayed
this
long
i
to
wait
and
see
what
they
got
to
eat
and
you
look
here
he
turned
upon
her
angrily
do
you
ever
do
that
again
do
what
send
somebody
after
me
that
pokes
his
nose
into
every
corner
of
the
house
till
he
finds
me
you
walter
adams
he
says
i
guess
he
must
asked
everybody
in
the
place
if
they
were
walter
adams
well
i
bet
a
few
iron
men
you
would
send
anybody
to
hunt
for
me
again
if
you
knew
where
he
found
me
where
was
it
walter
decided
that
her
fit
punishment
was
to
know
i
was
shootin
dice
with
those
coons
in
the
and
he
saw
you
unless
he
was
blind
said
walter
come
on
i
dance
this
one
more
dance
with
you
supper
comes
after
that
and
then
we
go
adams
heard
alice
key
turning
in
the
front
door
and
hurried
down
the
stairs
to
meet
her
did
you
get
wet
coming
in
darling
she
asked
did
you
have
a
good
time
just
lovely
alice
said
cheerily
and
after
she
had
arranged
the
latch
for
walter
who
had
gone
to
return
the
little
car
she
followed
her
mother
upstairs
and
hummed
a
on
the
way
oh
i
so
glad
you
had
a
nice
time
adams
said
as
they
reached
the
door
of
her
daughter
room
together
you
deserved
to
and
lovely
to
think
but
at
this
without
warning
alice
threw
herself
into
her
arms
sobbing
so
loudly
that
in
his
room
close
by
her
father
half
drowsing
through
the
night
started
to
full
wakefulness
chapter
ix
on
a
morning
a
week
after
this
collapse
of
festal
hopes
adams
and
her
daughter
were
concluding
a
disturbance
the
spring
postponed
until
now
by
adams
long
illness
and
alice
on
her
knees
before
a
chest
of
drawers
in
her
mother
room
paused
thoughtfully
after
dusting
a
packet
of
letters
wrapped
in
worn
muslin
she
called
to
her
mother
who
was
scrubbing
the
floor
of
the
hallway
just
beyond
the
open
door
these
old
letters
you
had
in
the
bottom
drawer
were
they
some
papa
wrote
you
before
you
were
married
adams
laughed
and
said
yes
just
put
back
where
they
were
or
else
up
in
the
attic
anywhere
you
want
do
you
mind
if
i
read
one
mama
adams
laughed
again
oh
i
guess
you
can
if
you
want
to
i
expect
they
pretty
funny
alice
laughed
in
response
and
chose
the
topmost
letter
of
the
packet
my
dear
beautiful
girl
it
began
and
she
stared
at
these
singular
words
they
gave
her
a
shock
like
that
caused
by
overhearing
some
bewildering
impropriety
and
having
read
them
over
to
herself
several
times
she
went
on
to
experience
other
shocks
my
dear
beautiful
girl
this
time
yesterday
i
had
a
mighty
bad
case
of
blues
because
i
had
not
had
a
word
from
you
in
two
whole
long
days
and
when
i
do
not
hear
from
you
every
day
things
look
mighty
down
in
the
mouth
to
me
now
it
is
all
so
different
because
your
letter
has
arrived
and
besides
i
have
got
a
piece
of
news
i
believe
you
will
think
as
fine
as
i
do
darling
you
will
be
surprised
so
get
ready
to
hear
about
a
big
effect
on
our
future
it
is
this
way
i
had
sort
of
a
suspicion
the
head
of
the
firm
kind
of
took
a
fancy
to
me
from
the
first
when
i
went
in
there
and
liked
the
way
i
attended
to
my
work
and
so
when
he
took
me
on
this
business
trip
with
him
i
felt
pretty
sure
of
it
and
now
it
turns
out
i
was
about
right
in
return
i
guess
i
have
got
about
the
best
boss
in
this
world
and
i
believe
you
will
think
so
too
yes
sweetheart
after
the
talk
i
have
just
had
with
him
if
j
lamb
asked
me
to
cut
my
hand
off
for
him
i
guess
i
would
come
pretty
near
doing
it
because
what
he
says
means
the
end
of
our
waiting
to
be
together
from
new
years
on
he
is
going
to
put
me
in
entire
charge
of
the
sundries
dept
and
what
do
you
think
is
going
to
be
my
salary
eleven
hundred
cool
dollars
a
year
that
all
just
only
a
cool
eleven
hundred
per
annum
well
i
guess
that
will
show
your
mother
whether
i
can
take
care
of
you
or
not
and
oh
how
i
would
like
to
see
your
dear
beautiful
loving
face
when
you
get
this
news
i
would
like
to
go
out
on
the
public
streets
and
just
dance
and
shout
and
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
help
doing
it
especially
when
i
know
we
will
be
talking
it
all
over
together
this
time
next
week
and
oh
my
darling
now
that
your
folks
have
no
excuse
for
putting
it
off
any
longer
we
might
be
in
our
own
little
home
before
xmas
would
you
be
glad
well
darling
this
settles
everything
and
makes
our
future
just
about
as
smooth
for
us
as
anybody
could
ask
i
can
hardly
realize
after
all
this
waiting
life
troubles
are
over
for
you
and
me
and
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
enjoy
the
happiness
granted
us
by
this
wonderful
beautiful
thing
we
call
life
i
know
i
am
not
any
poet
and
the
one
i
tried
to
write
about
you
the
day
of
the
picnic
was
fearful
but
the
way
i
think
about
you
is
a
poem
write
me
what
you
think
of
the
news
i
know
but
write
me
anyhow
i
get
it
before
we
start
home
and
i
can
be
reading
it
over
all
the
time
on
the
tram
your
always
loving
virgil
the
sound
of
her
mother
diligent
scrubbing
in
the
hall
came
back
slowly
to
alice
hearing
as
she
restored
the
letter
to
the
packet
wrapped
the
packet
in
its
muslin
covering
and
returned
it
to
the
drawer
she
had
remained
upon
her
knees
while
she
read
the
letter
now
she
sank
backward
sitting
upon
the
floor
with
her
hands
behind
her
an
unconscious
relaxing
for
better
ease
to
think
upon
her
face
there
had
fallen
a
look
of
wonder
for
the
first
time
she
was
vaguely
perceiving
that
life
is
everlasting
movement
youth
really
believes
what
is
running
water
to
be
a
permanent
crystallization
and
sees
time
fixed
to
a
point
some
people
have
dark
hair
some
people
have
blond
hair
some
people
have
gray
hair
until
this
moment
alice
had
no
conviction
that
there
was
a
universe
before
she
came
into
it
she
had
always
thought
of
it
as
the
background
of
herself
the
moon
was
something
to
make
her
prettier
on
a
summer
night
but
this
old
letter
through
which
she
saw
still
flickering
an
ancient
starlight
of
young
love
astounded
her
faintly
before
her
it
revealed
the
whole
lives
of
her
father
and
mother
who
had
been
young
after
all
they
really
had
and
their
youth
was
now
so
utterly
passed
from
them
that
the
picture
of
it
in
the
letter
was
like
a
burlesque
of
them
and
so
she
herself
must
pass
to
such
changes
too
and
all
that
now
seemed
vital
to
her
would
be
nothing
when
her
work
was
finished
that
afternoon
she
went
into
her
room
his
recovery
had
progressed
well
enough
to
permit
the
departure
of
miss
perry
and
adams
wearing
one
of
adams
wrappers
over
his
sat
in
a
chair
by
a
closed
window
the
weather
was
warm
but
the
closed
window
and
the
flannel
wrapper
had
not
sufficed
him
round
his
shoulders
he
had
an
old
crocheted
scarf
of
alice
his
legs
were
wrapped
in
a
heavy
comfort
and
with
these
swathings
about
him
and
his
eyes
closed
his
thin
and
grizzled
head
making
but
a
slight
indentation
in
the
pillow
supporting
it
he
looked
old
and
little
and
queer
alice
would
have
gone
out
softly
but
without
opening
his
eyes
he
spoke
to
her
do
go
dearie
come
sit
with
the
old
man
a
little
she
brought
a
chair
near
his
i
thought
you
were
no
i
do
hardly
ever
do
that
i
just
drift
a
little
how
do
you
mean
you
drift
papa
he
looked
at
her
vaguely
oh
i
do
know
kind
of
pictures
they
get
a
little
mixed
up
old
times
with
times
still
ahead
like
planning
what
to
do
you
know
that
as
near
a
nap
as
i
get
when
the
pictures
mix
up
some
i
suppose
it
sort
of
she
took
one
of
his
hands
and
stroked
it
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
you
have
pictures
like
what
to
do
she
asked
i
mean
planning
what
to
do
when
i
get
out
and
able
to
go
to
work
but
that
does
need
any
planning
alice
said
quickly
you
going
back
to
your
old
place
at
lamb
of
adams
closed
his
eyes
again
sighing
heavily
but
made
no
other
response
why
of
course
you
are
she
cried
what
are
you
talking
about
his
head
turned
slowly
toward
her
revealing
the
eyes
open
in
a
haggard
stare
i
heard
you
the
other
night
when
you
came
from
the
party
he
said
i
know
what
was
the
indeed
you
do
she
assured
him
you
do
know
anything
about
it
because
there
was
anything
the
matter
at
do
you
suppose
i
heard
you
crying
what
you
cry
for
if
there
was
anything
the
matter
just
nerves
papa
it
was
anything
else
in
the
never
mind
he
said
your
mother
told
she
promised
me
not
to
at
that
adams
laughed
mournfully
it
would
be
very
likely
i
hear
you
so
upset
and
not
ask
about
it
even
if
she
did
come
and
tell
me
on
her
own
hook
you
need
try
to
fool
me
i
tell
you
i
know
what
was
the
the
only
matter
was
i
had
a
silly
fit
alice
protested
it
did
me
good
how
that
because
i
decided
to
do
something
about
it
that
is
the
way
your
mother
looks
at
it
adams
said
ruefully
she
thinks
it
our
place
to
do
something
about
it
well
i
do
know
i
do
know
everything
seems
so
changed
these
days
you
always
been
a
good
daughter
alice
and
you
ought
to
have
as
much
as
any
of
these
girls
you
go
with
she
convinced
me
she
right
about
that
the
trouble
is
he
faltered
apologetically
then
went
on
i
mean
the
question
is
how
to
get
it
for
no
she
cried
i
had
no
business
to
make
such
a
fuss
just
because
a
lot
of
idiots
did
break
their
necks
to
get
dances
with
me
and
because
i
got
mortified
about
walter
walter
was
pretty
terrible
oh
me
my
adams
lamented
i
guess
that
something
we
just
have
to
leave
work
out
itself
what
you
going
to
do
with
a
boy
nineteen
or
twenty
years
old
that
makes
his
own
living
ca
whip
him
ca
keep
him
locked
up
in
the
house
just
got
to
hope
he
learn
better
i
of
course
he
did
want
to
go
to
the
palmers
alice
explained
tolerantly
and
as
mama
and
i
made
him
take
me
and
he
thought
that
was
pretty
selfish
in
me
why
he
felt
he
had
a
right
to
amuse
himself
any
way
he
could
of
course
it
was
awful
that
this
that
this
russell
should
in
spite
of
her
the
recollection
choked
her
yes
it
was
awful
adams
agreed
just
awful
oh
me
my
but
alice
recovered
herself
at
once
and
showed
him
a
cheerful
face
well
just
a
few
years
from
now
i
probably
wo
even
remember
it
i
believe
hardly
anything
amounts
to
as
much
as
we
think
it
does
at
the
well
sometimes
it
what
i
been
thinking
papa
it
seems
to
me
i
ought
to
do
what
like
she
looked
dreamy
but
was
obviously
serious
as
she
told
him
well
i
mean
i
ought
to
be
something
besides
just
a
kind
of
nobody
i
ought
to
she
paused
what
dearie
well
there
one
thing
i
like
to
do
i
sure
i
could
do
it
what
i
want
to
go
on
the
stage
i
know
i
could
at
this
her
father
abruptly
gave
utterance
to
a
feeble
cackling
of
laughter
and
when
alice
surprised
and
a
little
offended
pressed
him
for
his
reason
he
tried
to
evade
saying
nothing
dearie
i
just
thought
of
but
she
persisted
until
he
had
to
explain
it
made
me
think
of
your
mother
sister
your
aunt
flora
that
died
when
you
were
little
he
said
she
was
always
telling
how
she
was
going
on
the
stage
and
talking
about
how
she
was
certain
she
make
a
great
actress
and
all
so
on
and
one
day
your
mother
broke
out
and
said
she
ought
gone
on
the
stage
herself
because
she
always
knew
she
had
the
talent
for
it
and
well
they
got
into
kind
of
a
spat
about
which
one
make
the
best
actress
i
had
to
go
out
in
the
hall
to
laugh
maybe
you
were
wrong
alice
said
gravely
if
they
both
felt
it
why
would
that
look
as
if
there
was
talent
in
the
family
i
always
thought
no
dearie
he
said
with
a
final
chuckle
your
mother
and
flora
were
different
from
a
good
many
others
i
expect
ninety
per
cent
of
all
the
women
i
ever
knew
were
just
sure
they
be
mighty
fine
actresses
if
they
ever
got
the
chance
well
i
guess
it
a
good
thing
they
enjoy
thinking
about
it
and
it
do
do
anybody
any
alice
was
piqued
for
several
days
she
had
thought
almost
continuously
of
a
career
to
be
won
by
her
own
genius
not
that
she
planned
details
or
concerned
herself
with
first
steps
her
picturings
overleaped
all
that
principally
she
saw
her
name
great
on
all
the
of
that
unkind
city
and
herself
unchanged
in
age
but
glamorous
with
fame
and
paris
clothes
returning
in
a
private
car
no
doubt
the
pleasantest
development
of
her
vision
was
a
dialogue
with
mildred
and
this
became
so
real
that
as
she
projected
it
alice
assumed
the
proper
expressions
for
both
parties
to
it
formed
words
with
her
lips
and
even
spoke
some
of
them
aloud
no
i
have
forgotten
you
russell
i
remember
you
quite
pleasantly
in
fact
you
were
a
miss
palmer
i
recall
in
those
funny
old
days
very
kind
of
you
i
shaw
i
appreciate
your
eagerness
to
do
something
for
me
in
your
own
little
home
as
you
say
a
reception
would
renew
my
acquaintanceship
with
many
old
friends
but
shaw
you
wo
mind
my
mentioning
that
i
do
find
much
inspiration
in
these
provincials
i
really
must
ask
you
not
to
press
me
an
time
is
not
her
own
though
of
course
i
could
hardly
expect
you
to
understand
thus
alice
illuminated
the
dull
time
but
she
retired
from
the
interview
with
her
father
still
manfully
displaying
an
outward
cheerfulness
while
depression
grew
heavier
within
as
if
she
had
eaten
soggy
cake
her
father
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
stage
and
she
was
aware
of
his
ignorance
yet
for
some
reason
his
innocently
skeptical
amusement
reduced
her
bright
project
almost
to
nothing
something
like
this
always
happened
it
seemed
she
was
continually
making
these
illuminations
all
gay
with
gildings
and
colourings
and
then
as
soon
as
anybody
else
so
much
as
glanced
at
them
even
her
father
who
loved
her
the
pretty
designs
were
stricken
with
a
desolating
pallor
is
this
life
alice
wondered
not
doubting
that
the
question
was
original
and
all
her
own
is
it
life
to
spend
your
time
imagining
things
that
are
so
and
never
will
be
beautiful
things
happen
to
other
people
why
should
i
be
the
only
one
they
never
can
happen
to
the
mood
lasted
overnight
and
was
still
upon
her
the
next
afternoon
when
an
errand
for
her
father
took
her
adams
had
decided
to
begin
smoking
again
and
alice
felt
rather
degraded
as
well
as
embarrassed
when
she
went
into
the
large
shop
her
father
had
named
and
asked
for
the
cheap
tobacco
he
used
in
his
pipe
she
fell
back
upon
an
air
of
amused
indulgence
hoping
thus
to
suggest
that
her
purchase
was
made
for
some
faithful
old
retainer
now
infirm
and
although
the
calmness
of
the
clerk
who
served
her
called
for
no
such
elaboration
of
her
sketch
she
ornamented
it
with
a
little
laugh
and
with
the
remark
as
she
dropped
the
package
into
her
i
sure
it
please
him
they
tell
me
it
the
kind
he
still
playing
lady
bountiful
smiling
to
herself
in
anticipation
of
the
joy
she
was
bringing
to
the
simple
old
negro
or
irish
follower
of
the
family
she
left
the
shop
but
as
she
came
out
upon
the
crowded
pavement
her
smile
vanished
quickly
next
to
the
door
of
the
there
was
the
open
entrance
to
a
stairway
and
above
this
rather
bleak
and
dark
aperture
a
displayed
in
begrimed
gilt
letters
the
information
that
business
college
occupied
the
upper
floors
of
the
building
furthermore
frincke
here
publicly
offered
personal
instruction
and
training
in
practical
mathematics
bookkeeping
and
all
branches
of
the
business
life
including
stenography
typewriting
alice
halted
for
a
moment
frowning
at
this
signboard
as
though
it
were
something
surprising
and
distasteful
which
she
had
never
seen
before
yet
it
was
conspicuous
in
a
busy
quarter
she
almost
always
passed
it
when
she
came
and
never
without
noticing
it
nor
was
this
the
first
time
she
had
paused
to
lift
toward
it
that
same
glance
of
vague
misgiving
the
building
was
not
what
the
changeful
city
defined
as
a
modern
one
and
the
dusty
wooden
stairway
as
seen
from
the
pavement
disappeared
upward
into
a
smoky
darkness
so
would
the
footsteps
of
a
girl
ascending
there
lead
to
a
hideous
obscurity
alice
thought
an
obscurity
as
dreary
and
as
permanent
as
death
and
like
dry
leaves
falling
about
her
she
saw
her
wintry
imaginings
in
the
may
air
pretty
girls
turning
into
withered
creatures
as
they
worked
at
old
maids
taking
dictation
from
men
with
double
chins
alice
saw
old
maids
of
a
dozen
different
kinds
taking
her
mind
eye
was
crowded
with
them
as
it
always
was
when
she
passed
that
stairway
entrance
and
though
they
were
all
different
from
one
another
all
of
them
looked
a
little
like
herself
she
hated
the
place
and
yet
she
seldom
hurried
by
it
or
averted
her
eyes
it
had
an
unpleasant
fascination
for
her
and
a
mysterious
reproach
which
she
did
not
seek
to
fathom
she
walked
on
thoughtfully
and
when
at
the
next
corner
she
turned
into
the
street
that
led
toward
home
she
was
given
a
surprise
arthur
russell
came
rapidly
from
behind
her
lifting
his
hat
as
she
saw
him
are
you
walking
north
miss
adams
he
asked
do
you
mind
if
i
walk
with
you
she
was
not
delighted
but
seemed
so
how
charming
she
cried
giving
him
a
little
flourish
of
the
shapely
hands
and
then
because
she
wondered
if
he
had
seen
her
coming
out
of
the
she
laughed
and
added
i
just
been
on
the
most
ridiculous
errand
what
was
that
to
order
some
cigars
for
my
father
he
been
quite
ill
poor
man
and
he
so
particular
but
what
in
the
world
do
know
about
cigars
russell
laughed
well
what
do
you
know
about
did
you
select
by
the
price
mercy
no
she
exclaimed
and
added
with
an
afterthought
of
course
he
wrote
down
the
name
of
the
kind
he
wanted
and
i
gave
it
to
the
shopman
i
could
never
have
pronounced
chapter
x
in
her
pocket
as
she
spoke
her
hand
rested
upon
the
little
sack
of
tobacco
which
responded
accusingly
to
the
touch
of
her
restless
fingers
and
she
found
time
to
wonder
why
she
was
building
up
this
fiction
for
arthur
russell
his
discovery
of
walter
device
for
whiling
away
the
dull
evening
had
shamed
and
distressed
her
but
she
would
have
suffered
no
less
if
almost
any
other
had
been
the
discoverer
in
this
gentleman
after
hearing
that
he
was
mildred
arthur
russell
alice
felt
not
the
slightest
personal
interest
and
there
was
yet
to
develop
in
her
life
such
a
thing
as
an
interest
not
personal
at
this
state
of
affairs
is
not
unique
so
far
as
alice
was
concerned
russell
might
have
worn
a
placard
she
looked
upon
him
as
diners
entering
a
restaurant
look
upon
tables
marked
reserved
the
glance
slightly
discontented
passes
on
at
once
or
so
the
eye
of
a
prospector
wanders
querulously
over
staked
and
established
claims
on
the
mountainside
and
seeks
the
virgin
land
beyond
unless
indeed
the
prospector
be
dishonest
but
alice
was
no
so
long
as
the
notice
of
ownership
was
plainly
posted
though
she
was
indifferent
now
habit
ruled
her
and
at
the
very
time
she
wondered
why
she
created
fictitious
cigars
for
her
father
she
was
also
regretting
that
she
had
not
boldly
carried
her
malacca
stick
with
her
her
vivacity
increased
automatically
perhaps
the
clerk
thought
you
wanted
the
cigars
for
yourself
russell
suggested
he
may
have
taken
you
for
a
spanish
i
sure
he
did
alice
agreed
gaily
and
she
hummed
a
bar
or
two
of
lapaloma
snapping
her
fingers
as
castanets
and
swaying
her
body
a
little
to
suggest
the
accepted
stencil
of
a
spanish
would
you
have
taken
me
for
one
russell
she
asked
as
she
concluded
the
impersonation
i
why
yes
he
said
i
take
you
for
anything
you
wanted
me
why
what
a
speech
she
cried
and
laughing
gave
him
a
quick
glance
in
which
there
glimmered
some
real
surprise
he
was
looking
at
her
quizzically
but
with
the
liveliest
appreciation
her
surprise
increased
and
she
was
glad
that
he
had
joined
her
to
be
seen
walking
with
such
a
companion
added
to
her
pleasure
she
would
have
described
him
as
altogether
quite
and
she
liked
his
tall
dark
thinness
his
gray
clothes
his
soft
hat
and
his
clean
brown
shoes
she
liked
his
easy
swing
of
the
stick
he
carried
should
i
have
said
it
he
asked
would
you
rather
not
be
taken
for
a
spanish
countess
that
is
it
she
explained
you
said
i
said
i
take
you
for
whatever
you
wanted
me
to
is
that
all
right
it
would
all
depend
would
it
of
course
it
would
depend
on
what
you
oh
no
she
laughed
it
might
depend
on
a
lot
of
such
as
well
she
hesitated
having
the
mischievous
impulse
to
say
such
as
mildred
but
she
decided
to
omit
this
reference
and
became
serious
remembering
russell
service
to
her
at
mildred
house
speaking
of
what
i
want
to
be
taken
for
she
said
i
been
wondering
ever
since
the
other
night
what
you
did
take
me
for
you
must
have
taken
me
for
the
sister
of
a
professional
gambler
i
afraid
russell
look
of
kindness
was
the
truth
about
him
she
was
to
discover
and
he
reassured
her
now
by
the
promptness
of
his
friendly
chuckle
then
your
young
brother
told
you
where
i
found
him
did
he
i
kept
my
face
straight
at
the
time
but
i
laughed
afterward
to
myself
it
struck
me
as
original
to
say
the
least
his
amusing
himself
with
those
walter
is
original
alice
said
and
having
adopted
this
new
view
of
her
brother
eccentricities
she
impulsively
went
on
to
make
it
more
plausible
he
a
very
odd
boy
and
i
was
afraid
you
misunderstand
he
tells
wonderful
stories
and
he
do
anything
to
draw
coloured
people
out
and
make
them
talk
and
that
what
he
was
doing
at
mildred
when
you
found
him
for
me
he
says
he
wins
their
confidence
by
playing
dice
with
them
in
the
family
we
think
he
probably
write
about
them
some
day
he
rather
are
you
russell
asked
smiling
i
oh
she
paused
lifting
both
hands
in
a
charming
gesture
of
helplessness
oh
i
just
me
his
glance
followed
the
lightly
waved
hands
with
keen
approval
then
rose
to
the
lively
and
colourful
face
with
its
hazel
eyes
its
small
and
pretty
nose
and
the
smile
which
seemed
the
climax
of
her
decorative
transition
never
had
he
seen
a
creature
so
plastic
or
so
wistful
here
was
a
contrast
to
his
cousin
mildred
who
was
not
wistful
and
controlled
any
impulses
toward
plasticity
if
she
had
them
by
george
he
said
but
you
are
different
with
that
there
leaped
in
her
such
an
impulse
of
roguish
gallantry
as
she
could
never
resist
she
turned
her
head
and
laughing
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
from
whom
she
cried
from
everybody
he
said
are
you
a
why
how
did
you
know
i
was
thinking
you
were
different
from
my
cousin
mildred
palmer
what
makes
you
think
i
did
know
it
nonsense
he
said
you
knew
what
i
was
thinking
and
i
knew
you
yes
she
said
with
cool
humour
how
intimate
that
seems
to
make
us
all
at
once
russell
left
no
doubt
that
he
was
delighted
with
these
gaieties
of
hers
by
george
he
exclaimed
again
i
thought
you
were
this
sort
of
girl
the
first
moment
i
saw
you
what
sort
of
girl
did
mildred
tell
you
what
sort
of
girl
i
am
when
she
asked
you
to
dance
with
me
she
did
ask
me
to
dance
with
you
i
been
looking
at
you
you
were
talking
to
some
old
ladies
and
i
asked
mildred
who
you
oh
so
mildred
did
alice
checked
herself
who
did
she
tell
you
i
was
she
just
said
you
were
a
miss
adams
so
i
miss
adams
alice
interrupted
yes
then
i
said
i
like
to
meet
i
see
you
thought
you
save
me
from
the
old
no
i
thought
i
save
myself
from
some
of
the
girls
mildred
was
getting
me
to
dance
with
there
was
a
miss
dowling
poor
man
alice
said
gently
and
her
impulsive
thought
was
that
mildred
had
taken
few
chances
and
that
as
a
matter
of
her
carefulness
might
have
been
well
founded
this
arthur
russell
was
a
much
more
responsive
person
than
one
had
supposed
so
russell
you
do
know
anything
about
me
except
what
you
thought
when
you
first
saw
me
yes
i
know
i
was
right
when
i
thought
you
have
told
me
what
you
i
thought
you
were
like
what
you
are
not
very
definite
is
it
i
afraid
you
shed
more
light
a
minute
or
so
ago
when
you
said
how
different
from
mildred
you
thought
i
was
that
was
definite
unfortunately
i
did
say
it
russell
explained
i
thought
it
and
you
read
my
mind
that
the
sort
of
girl
i
thought
you
were
one
that
could
read
a
man
mind
why
do
you
say
you
not
like
mildred
alice
smooth
gesture
seemed
to
sketch
mildred
because
perfect
why
she
perfectly
perfect
she
never
makes
a
mistake
and
everybody
looks
up
to
her
oh
yes
we
all
fairly
adore
her
she
like
some
big
noble
cold
statue
above
the
rest
of
us
and
she
hardly
ever
does
anything
mean
or
treacherous
of
all
the
girls
i
know
i
believe
she
played
the
fewest
really
petty
tricks
she
russell
interrupted
he
looked
perplexed
you
say
she
perfectly
perfect
but
that
she
does
play
some
alice
laughed
as
if
at
his
sweet
innocence
men
are
so
funny
she
informed
him
of
course
girls
all
do
mean
things
sometimes
my
own
career
just
one
long
brazen
smirch
of
what
i
mean
is
perfectly
perfect
compared
to
the
rest
of
i
see
he
said
and
seemed
to
need
a
moment
or
two
of
thoughtfulness
then
he
inquired
what
sort
of
treacherous
things
do
you
do
i
oh
the
very
worst
kind
most
people
bore
me
particularly
the
men
in
this
town
and
i
show
but
i
should
call
that
treacherous
well
they
do
alice
laughed
it
made
me
a
terribly
unpopular
character
i
do
a
lot
of
things
they
hate
for
instance
at
a
dance
a
lot
rather
find
some
clever
old
woman
and
talk
to
her
than
dance
with
of
these
nonentities
i
usually
do
it
but
you
danced
as
if
you
liked
it
you
danced
better
than
any
other
girl
i
this
flattery
of
yours
does
quite
turn
my
head
russell
alice
interrupted
particularly
since
mildred
only
gave
you
ella
dowling
to
compare
with
me
oh
no
he
insisted
there
were
others
and
of
course
mildred
oh
of
course
yes
i
forgot
that
well
she
paused
then
added
i
certainly
ought
to
dance
why
is
it
so
much
a
duty
when
i
think
of
the
and
the
expense
to
papa
all
sorts
of
fancy
instructors
i
suppose
that
what
daughters
have
fathers
for
though
is
it
to
throw
money
away
on
them
you
do
russell
began
and
his
look
was
one
of
alarm
you
have
taken
up
she
understood
his
apprehension
and
responded
merrily
oh
murder
no
you
mean
you
afraid
i
break
out
sometimes
in
a
piece
of
cheesecloth
and
run
around
a
fountain
thirty
times
and
then
for
an
encore
show
how
much
like
snakes
i
can
make
my
arms
i
said
you
were
a
he
exclaimed
that
exactly
what
i
was
pretending
to
be
afraid
you
might
that
nicer
of
you
no
it
not
my
what
is
oh
nothing
in
particular
that
i
know
of
just
now
of
course
i
had
the
usual
one
the
one
that
every
girl
goes
what
that
good
heavens
russell
you
ca
expect
me
to
believe
you
really
a
man
of
the
world
if
you
do
know
that
every
girl
has
a
time
in
her
life
when
she
positive
she
divinely
talented
for
the
stage
it
the
only
universal
rule
about
women
that
has
got
an
exception
i
mean
we
all
want
to
go
on
the
stage
but
we
all
think
we
be
wonderful
if
we
did
even
mildred
oh
she
would
confess
it
to
you
you
have
to
know
her
a
great
deal
better
than
any
man
can
ever
know
her
to
find
i
see
he
said
girls
are
always
telling
us
we
ca
know
them
i
wonder
if
you
she
took
up
his
thought
before
he
expressed
it
and
again
he
was
fascinated
by
her
quickness
which
indeed
seemed
to
him
almost
telepathic
oh
but
do
we
know
one
another
though
she
cried
such
things
we
have
to
keep
secret
things
that
go
on
right
before
your
eyes
why
do
some
of
you
tell
us
he
asked
we
ca
tell
too
much
honour
no
not
even
too
much
honour
among
thieves
russell
we
do
tell
you
about
our
tricks
against
one
another
because
we
know
it
make
any
impression
on
you
the
tricks
are
played
against
you
and
you
have
a
soft
side
for
cats
with
lovely
manners
what
about
your
tricks
against
us
oh
those
alice
laughed
we
think
they
rather
cute
bravo
he
cried
and
hammered
the
ferrule
of
his
stick
upon
the
pavement
what
the
applause
for
for
you
what
you
said
was
like
running
up
the
black
flag
to
the
oh
no
it
was
just
a
modest
little
sign
in
a
pretty
beware
i
see
i
must
he
said
gallantly
thanks
but
i
mean
beware
of
the
whole
bloomin
garden
then
picking
up
a
thread
that
had
almost
disappeared
you
need
think
you
ever
find
out
whether
i
right
about
mildred
not
being
an
exception
by
asking
her
she
said
she
wo
tell
you
she
not
the
sort
that
ever
makes
a
but
russell
had
not
followed
her
shift
to
the
former
topic
not
being
an
exception
he
said
vaguely
i
do
an
exception
about
thinking
she
could
be
a
wonderful
thing
on
the
stage
if
she
only
cared
to
if
you
asked
her
i
pretty
sure
she
say
nonsense
mildred
the
dearest
finest
thing
anywhere
but
you
find
out
many
things
about
her
by
asking
russell
expression
became
more
serious
as
it
did
whenever
his
cousin
was
made
their
topic
you
think
not
he
said
you
think
she
no
but
it
not
because
she
is
sincere
exactly
it
only
because
she
has
such
a
lot
to
live
up
to
she
has
to
live
up
to
being
a
girl
on
the
grand
style
to
herself
i
mean
of
and
without
pausing
alice
rippled
on
you
ought
to
have
seen
me
when
i
had
the
i
used
to
play
all
alone
in
my
room
she
lifted
her
arms
in
graceful
entreaty
pleading
musically
o
swear
not
by
the
moon
the
inconstant
moon
that
monthly
changes
in
her
circled
orb
lest
thy
love
prove
she
broke
off
abruptly
with
a
little
flourish
snapping
thumb
and
finger
of
each
outstretched
hand
then
laughed
and
said
papa
used
to
make
such
fun
of
me
thank
heaven
i
was
only
fifteen
i
was
all
over
it
by
the
next
no
wonder
you
had
the
fever
russell
observed
you
do
it
beautifully
why
did
you
finish
the
line
which
one
thy
love
prove
likewise
variable
juliet
was
saying
it
to
a
man
you
know
she
seems
to
have
been
ready
to
worry
about
his
constancy
pretty
early
in
their
affair
her
companion
was
again
thoughtful
yes
he
said
seeming
to
be
rather
irksomely
impressed
with
alice
suggestion
yes
it
does
appear
alice
glanced
at
his
serious
face
and
yielded
to
an
audacious
temptation
you
must
take
it
so
hard
she
said
flippantly
it
is
about
you
it
only
about
romeo
and
see
here
he
exclaimed
you
are
at
your
again
are
you
there
are
times
when
it
wo
do
you
know
she
leaned
toward
him
a
little
as
if
companionably
they
were
walking
slowly
and
this
geniality
of
hers
brought
her
shoulder
in
light
contact
with
his
for
a
moment
do
you
dislike
my
she
asked
and
across
their
two
just
touching
shoulders
gave
him
her
sudden
look
of
smiling
wistfulness
do
you
hate
it
he
shook
his
head
no
i
do
he
said
gravely
it
quite
pleasant
but
i
think
it
says
beware
she
instantly
moved
away
from
him
with
the
lawless
and
frank
laugh
of
one
who
is
delighted
to
be
caught
in
a
piece
of
hypocrisy
how
lovely
she
cried
then
she
pointed
ahead
our
walk
is
nearly
over
coming
to
the
foolish
little
house
where
i
live
it
a
queer
little
place
but
my
father
so
attached
to
it
the
family
have
about
given
up
hope
of
getting
him
to
build
a
real
house
farther
out
he
does
mind
our
being
extravagant
about
anything
else
but
he
wo
let
us
alter
one
single
thing
about
his
precious
little
old
house
well
she
halted
and
gave
him
her
hand
adieu
i
could
he
began
hesitated
then
asked
i
could
come
in
with
you
for
a
little
while
not
now
she
said
quickly
you
can
come
she
paused
when
almost
any
she
turned
and
walked
slowly
up
the
path
but
he
waited
you
can
come
in
the
evening
if
you
like
she
called
back
to
him
over
her
shoulder
soon
as
soon
as
you
like
she
waved
her
hand
then
ran
indoors
and
watched
him
from
a
window
as
he
went
up
the
street
he
walked
rapidly
a
fine
easy
figure
swinging
his
stick
in
a
way
that
suggested
exhilaration
alice
staring
after
him
through
the
irregular
apertures
of
a
lace
curtain
showed
no
similar
buoyancy
upon
the
instant
she
closed
the
door
all
sparkle
left
her
she
had
become
at
once
the
simple
and
sometimes
troubled
girl
her
family
knew
what
is
going
on
out
there
her
mother
asked
approaching
from
the
oh
nothing
alice
said
indifferently
as
she
turned
away
that
russell
met
me
downtown
and
walked
up
with
mr
russell
oh
the
one
that
engaged
to
mildred
well
i
do
know
for
certain
he
did
seem
so
much
like
an
engaged
man
to
and
she
added
in
the
tone
of
thoughtful
preoccupation
anyhow
not
so
terribly
then
she
ran
upstairs
gave
her
father
his
tobacco
filled
his
pipe
for
him
and
petted
him
as
he
lighted
it
chapter
xi
after
that
she
went
to
her
room
and
sat
down
before
her
mirror
there
was
where
she
nearly
always
sat
when
she
came
into
her
room
if
she
had
nothing
in
mind
to
do
she
went
to
that
chair
as
naturally
as
a
dog
goes
to
his
corner
she
leaned
forward
observing
her
profile
gravity
seemed
to
be
her
mood
but
after
a
long
almost
motionless
scrutiny
she
began
to
produce
dramatic
sketches
upon
that
stage
her
countenance
she
showed
gaiety
satire
doubt
gentleness
appreciation
of
a
companion
and
all
studied
in
profile
first
then
repeated
for
a
subsequently
she
ran
through
them
facing
herself
in
full
in
this
manner
she
outlined
a
playful
scenario
for
her
next
interview
with
arthur
russell
but
grew
solemn
again
thinking
of
the
impression
she
had
already
sought
to
give
him
she
had
no
twinges
for
any
underminings
of
her
most
intimate
friend
in
fact
she
felt
that
her
work
on
a
new
portrait
of
mildred
for
russell
had
been
honest
and
accurate
but
why
had
it
been
her
instinct
to
show
him
an
alice
adams
who
did
exist
almost
everything
she
had
said
to
him
was
upon
spontaneous
impulse
springing
to
her
lips
on
the
instant
yet
it
all
seemed
to
have
been
founded
upon
a
careful
design
as
if
some
hidden
self
kept
such
designs
in
stock
and
handed
them
up
to
her
to
be
used
for
its
own
purpose
what
appeared
to
be
the
desired
result
was
a
image
in
russell
mind
but
if
he
liked
that
image
he
would
be
liking
alice
adams
nor
would
anything
he
thought
about
the
image
be
a
thought
about
her
nevertheless
she
knew
she
would
go
on
with
her
false
fancy
colourings
of
this
nothing
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
again
she
had
just
been
practicing
them
what
the
idea
she
wondered
what
makes
me
tell
such
lies
why
should
i
be
just
myself
and
then
she
thought
but
which
one
is
myself
her
eyes
dwelt
on
the
solemn
eyes
in
the
mirror
and
her
lips
disquieted
by
a
deepening
wonder
parted
to
whisper
who
in
the
world
are
you
the
apparition
before
her
had
obeyed
her
like
an
alert
slave
but
now
as
she
subsided
to
a
complete
stillness
that
aspect
changed
to
the
old
mockery
with
which
mirrors
avenge
their
wrongs
the
nucleus
of
some
queer
thing
seemed
to
gather
and
shape
itself
behind
the
nothingness
of
the
reflected
eyes
until
it
became
almost
an
actual
strange
presence
if
it
could
be
identified
perhaps
the
presence
was
that
of
the
hidden
designer
who
handed
up
the
false
pictures
and
for
unknown
purposes
made
alice
exhibit
them
but
whatever
it
was
she
suddenly
found
it
and
terrifying
in
a
flutter
she
jumped
up
and
went
to
another
part
of
the
room
a
moment
or
two
later
she
was
whistling
softly
as
she
hung
her
light
coat
over
a
wooden
triangle
in
her
closet
and
her
musing
now
was
quainter
than
the
experience
that
led
to
it
for
what
she
thought
was
this
i
certainly
am
a
queer
girl
she
took
a
little
pride
in
so
much
originality
believing
herself
probably
the
only
person
in
the
world
to
have
such
thoughts
as
had
been
hers
since
she
entered
the
room
and
the
first
to
be
disturbed
by
a
strange
presence
in
the
mirror
in
fact
the
effect
of
the
tiny
episode
became
apparent
in
that
look
of
preoccupied
complacency
to
be
seen
for
a
time
upon
any
girl
who
has
found
reason
to
suspect
that
she
is
a
being
without
counterpart
this
slight
glow
still
faintly
radiant
was
observed
across
the
by
walter
but
he
misinterpreted
it
what
you
lookin
so
about
he
inquired
and
added
in
his
knowing
way
i
saw
you
all
right
cutie
where
you
see
me
this
afternoon
you
mean
walter
yes
afternoon
i
mean
walter
he
returned
burlesquing
her
voice
at
least
happily
enough
to
please
himself
for
he
laughed
applausively
oh
you
never
saw
me
i
passed
you
close
enough
to
pull
a
tooth
but
you
were
awful
busy
i
never
did
see
anybody
as
busy
as
you
get
alice
when
you
towin
a
barge
my
but
you
keep
your
hands
goin
looked
like
the
air
was
full
of
that
why
i
onto
why
you
look
so
tickled
this
evening
i
saw
you
with
that
big
adams
laughed
benevolently
she
was
not
displeased
with
this
rallying
well
what
of
it
walter
she
asked
if
you
happen
to
see
your
sister
on
the
street
when
some
nice
young
man
is
being
attentive
to
her
walter
barked
and
then
cackled
whoa
sal
he
said
you
got
the
parts
mixed
it
little
alice
that
was
attentive
i
know
the
big
fish
she
was
attentive
to
all
right
yes
his
sister
retorted
quietly
i
should
think
you
might
have
recognized
him
walter
looked
annoyed
still
harpin
on
that
he
complained
the
kind
of
women
i
like
if
they
get
sore
they
just
hit
you
somewhere
on
the
face
and
then
they
through
by
the
way
i
heard
this
russell
was
supposed
to
be
your
dear
old
sweet
friend
mildred
steady
what
you
doin
walkin
as
close
to
him
as
all
that
adams
addressed
her
son
in
gentle
reproof
why
walter
oh
never
mind
mama
alice
said
to
the
horrid
all
things
are
get
out
walter
protested
carelessly
i
heard
all
about
this
russell
down
at
the
shop
young
joe
lamb
such
a
talker
i
wonder
he
do
ruin
his
grandfather
business
he
keeps
all
us
cheap
help
standin
round
listening
to
him
of
our
time
well
joe
told
me
this
russell
some
kin
or
other
to
the
palmer
family
and
he
got
some
little
money
of
his
own
and
he
puttin
it
into
ole
palmer
trust
company
and
palmer
goin
to
make
him
a
of
the
company
sort
of
a
arrangement
joe
lamb
adams
looked
thoughtful
i
do
see
she
began
why
this
russell
supposed
to
be
tied
up
to
mildred
her
son
explained
when
ole
palmer
dies
this
russell
will
be
his
and
all
he
haf
to
do
be
to
barely
lift
his
feet
and
step
into
the
ole
man
shoes
it
certainly
a
mighty
fat
for
this
russell
you
better
lay
off
o
there
alice
pick
somebody
that
got
less
to
lose
and
you
make
better
adams
air
of
thoughtfulness
had
not
departed
but
you
say
this
russell
is
well
off
on
his
own
account
oh
joe
lamb
says
he
got
some
little
of
his
own
did
know
how
well
then
walter
laughed
his
laugh
cut
it
out
he
bade
her
alice
would
run
in
fourth
alice
had
been
looking
at
him
in
a
detached
way
as
though
estimating
the
value
of
a
specimen
in
a
collection
not
her
own
yes
she
said
indifferently
you
really
are
vulgar
he
had
finished
his
meal
and
rising
he
came
round
the
table
to
her
and
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
good
ole
allie
he
said
honest
you
would
run
in
fourth
place
if
i
was
you
i
never
even
start
in
the
class
that
gang
will
rule
you
off
the
track
soon
as
they
see
your
walter
his
mother
said
again
well
ai
i
her
brother
he
returned
seeming
to
be
entirely
serious
and
direct
for
the
moment
at
least
like
the
ole
girl
all
right
fact
is
sometimes
i
kind
of
sorry
for
but
what
it
all
about
alice
cried
simply
because
you
met
me
with
a
man
i
never
saw
but
once
before
and
just
barely
know
why
all
this
palaver
he
repeated
grinning
well
i
seen
you
start
before
you
know
he
went
to
the
door
and
paused
i
got
no
date
take
you
to
the
movies
you
care
to
she
declined
crisply
no
thanks
come
on
he
said
as
pleasantly
as
he
knew
how
give
me
a
chance
to
show
you
a
better
time
than
we
had
up
at
that
joint
i
get
you
some
chop
suey
no
thanks
all
right
he
responded
and
waved
a
flippant
adieu
as
the
barber
says
better
the
advice
the
worse
it
wasted
alice
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
a
moment
or
two
later
as
the
jar
of
the
carelessly
slammed
front
door
went
through
the
house
she
shook
her
head
reconsidering
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
gone
with
him
it
might
have
kept
him
away
from
whatever
dreadful
people
are
his
friends
at
least
for
one
oh
i
sure
walter
a
good
boy
adams
said
soothingly
and
this
was
what
she
almost
always
said
when
either
her
husband
or
alice
expressed
such
misgivings
he
odd
and
he
picked
up
right
queer
manners
but
that
only
because
we
have
given
him
advantages
like
the
other
young
men
but
i
sure
he
a
good
she
reverted
to
the
subject
a
little
later
while
she
washed
the
dishes
and
alice
wiped
them
of
course
walter
could
take
his
place
with
the
other
nice
boys
of
the
town
even
yet
she
said
i
mean
if
we
could
afford
to
help
him
financially
they
all
belong
to
the
country
clubs
and
have
cars
and
let
do
go
into
that
any
more
mama
the
daughter
begged
her
what
the
use
it
could
be
of
use
adams
insisted
it
could
if
your
father
but
papa
yes
he
but
how
can
he
he
told
me
a
man
of
his
age
ca
give
up
a
business
he
been
in
practically
all
his
life
and
just
go
groping
about
for
something
that
might
never
turn
up
at
all
i
think
he
right
about
it
too
of
course
adams
splashed
among
the
plates
with
a
new
vigour
heightened
by
an
old
bitterness
oh
yes
she
said
he
talks
that
way
but
he
knows
how
could
he
better
mama
he
knows
how
but
what
does
he
know
adams
tossed
her
head
you
do
suppose
i
such
a
fool
be
urging
him
to
give
up
something
for
nothing
do
you
alice
do
you
suppose
i
want
him
to
just
go
around
like
he
was
telling
you
that
would
be
crazy
of
course
little
as
his
work
at
lamb
brings
in
i
would
be
so
silly
as
to
ask
him
to
give
it
up
just
on
a
chance
he
could
find
something
else
good
gracious
alice
you
must
give
me
credit
for
a
little
intelligence
once
in
a
while
alice
was
puzzled
but
what
else
could
there
be
except
a
chance
i
do
see
well
i
do
her
mother
interrupted
decisively
that
man
could
make
us
all
well
off
right
now
if
he
wanted
to
we
could
have
been
rich
long
ago
if
he
ever
really
felt
as
he
ought
to
about
his
what
why
how
could
you
know
how
as
well
as
i
do
adams
said
crossly
i
guess
you
have
forgotten
how
he
treated
me
about
it
the
sunday
before
he
got
she
went
on
with
her
work
putting
into
it
a
sudden
violence
inspired
by
the
recollection
but
alice
enlightened
gave
utterance
to
a
laugh
of
lugubrious
derision
oh
the
glue
factory
again
she
cried
how
silly
and
she
renewed
her
laughter
so
often
do
the
great
projects
of
parents
appear
ignominious
to
their
children
adams
conception
of
a
glue
factory
as
a
fairy
godmother
of
this
family
was
an
absurd
old
story
which
alice
had
never
taken
seriously
she
remembered
that
when
she
was
about
fifteen
her
mother
began
now
and
then
to
say
something
to
adams
about
a
glue
factory
rather
timidly
and
as
a
vague
suggestion
but
never
without
irritating
him
then
for
years
the
preposterous
subject
had
not
been
mentioned
possibly
because
of
some
explosion
on
the
part
of
adams
when
his
daughter
had
not
been
present
but
during
the
last
year
adams
had
quietly
gone
back
to
these
old
hints
reviving
them
at
intervals
and
also
reviving
her
husband
irritation
alice
bored
impression
was
that
her
mother
wanted
him
to
found
or
buy
or
do
something
or
other
about
a
glue
factory
and
that
he
considered
the
proposal
so
impracticable
as
to
be
insulting
the
parental
conversations
took
place
when
neither
alice
nor
walter
was
at
hand
but
sometimes
alice
had
come
in
upon
the
conclusion
of
one
to
find
her
father
in
a
shouting
mood
and
shocking
the
air
behind
him
with
profane
monosyllables
as
he
departed
adams
would
be
left
quiet
and
troubled
and
when
alice
sympathizing
with
the
goaded
man
inquired
of
her
mother
why
these
tiresome
bickerings
had
been
renewed
she
always
got
the
brooding
and
cryptic
answer
he
could
do
it
if
he
wanted
alice
failed
to
comprehend
the
desirability
of
a
glue
factory
to
her
mind
a
father
engaged
in
a
glue
factory
lacked
impressiveness
had
no
advantage
over
a
father
employed
by
lamb
and
company
and
she
supposed
that
adams
knew
better
than
her
mother
whether
such
an
enterprise
would
be
profitable
or
not
emphatically
he
thought
it
would
not
for
she
had
heard
him
shouting
at
the
end
of
one
of
these
painful
interviews
you
can
keep
up
your
dang
talk
till
you
die
and
die
but
i
never
make
one
cent
that
way
there
had
been
a
culmination
returning
from
church
on
the
sunday
preceding
the
collapse
with
which
adams
illness
had
begun
alice
found
her
mother
downstairs
weeping
and
intimidated
while
her
stamping
footsteps
were
loudly
audible
as
he
strode
up
and
down
his
room
overhead
so
were
his
endless
repetitions
of
invective
loudly
audible
that
woman
oh
that
woman
oh
that
danged
woman
adams
admitted
to
her
daughter
that
it
was
the
old
glue
factory
and
that
her
husband
wildness
had
frightened
her
into
a
solemn
promise
never
to
mention
the
subject
again
so
long
as
she
had
breath
alice
laughed
the
glue
factory
idea
was
not
only
a
bore
but
ridiculous
and
her
mother
evident
seriousness
about
it
one
of
those
inexplicable
vagaries
we
sometimes
discover
in
the
people
we
know
best
but
this
sunday
rampage
appeared
to
be
the
end
of
it
and
when
adams
came
down
to
dinner
an
hour
later
he
was
unusually
cheerful
alice
was
glad
he
had
gone
wild
enough
to
settle
the
glue
factory
once
and
for
all
and
she
had
ceased
to
think
of
the
episode
long
before
friday
of
that
week
when
adams
was
brought
home
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
by
his
old
employer
the
great
j
lamb
in
the
latter
car
during
the
long
illness
the
glue
factory
was
completely
forgotten
by
alice
at
least
and
her
laugh
was
rueful
as
well
as
derisive
now
in
the
kitchen
when
she
realized
that
her
mother
mind
again
dwelt
upon
this
abandoned
nuisance
i
thought
you
got
over
all
that
nonsense
mama
she
said
adams
smiled
pathetically
of
course
you
think
it
nonsense
dearie
young
people
think
everything
nonsense
that
they
do
know
anything
good
gracious
alice
cried
i
should
think
i
used
to
hear
enough
about
that
horrible
old
glue
factory
to
know
something
about
it
no
her
mother
returned
patiently
you
never
heard
anything
about
it
at
i
have
no
your
father
and
i
did
discuss
it
before
you
children
all
you
ever
heard
was
when
he
get
in
such
a
rage
after
we
been
speaking
of
it
that
he
could
control
himself
when
you
came
in
was
always
quiet
did
ever
go
on
talking
about
it
no
perhaps
not
but
you
talking
about
it
now
mama
after
you
promised
never
to
mention
it
i
promised
not
to
mention
it
to
your
father
said
adams
gently
i
have
mentioned
it
to
him
have
i
ah
but
if
you
mention
it
to
me
i
afraid
you
will
mention
it
to
him
you
always
do
speak
of
things
that
you
have
on
your
mind
and
you
might
get
papa
all
stirred
up
again
about
alice
paused
a
light
of
divination
flickering
in
her
eyes
oh
she
cried
i
see
what
do
you
see
you
have
been
at
him
about
it
not
one
single
word
no
alice
cried
not
a
word
but
that
what
you
meant
all
along
you
have
spoken
the
words
to
him
but
all
this
urging
him
to
change
to
something
better
to
go
into
it
all
been
about
nothing
on
earth
but
your
foolish
old
glue
factory
that
you
know
upsets
him
and
you
gave
your
solemn
word
never
to
speak
to
him
about
again
you
say
it
but
you
meant
it
and
he
knows
that
what
you
meant
oh
mama
adams
with
her
hands
still
automatically
at
work
in
the
flooded
dishpan
turned
to
face
her
daughter
alice
she
said
tremulously
what
do
i
ask
for
myself
what
i
say
what
do
i
ask
for
myself
do
you
suppose
want
anything
do
you
know
i
be
perfectly
content
on
your
father
present
income
if
i
were
the
only
person
to
be
considered
what
do
i
care
about
any
pleasure
for
myself
i
be
willing
never
to
have
a
maid
again
do
mind
doing
the
work
if
we
did
have
any
children
i
be
glad
to
do
your
father
cooking
and
the
housework
and
the
washing
and
ironing
too
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
would
care
i
a
poor
cook
and
a
poor
housekeeper
i
do
do
anything
well
but
it
would
be
good
enough
for
just
him
and
me
i
would
ever
utter
one
word
of
com
oh
goodness
alice
lamented
what
is
it
all
about
it
about
this
said
adams
swallowing
you
and
walter
are
a
new
generation
and
you
ought
to
have
the
same
as
the
rest
of
the
new
generation
get
poor
walter
asking
you
to
go
to
the
movies
and
a
chinese
restaurant
the
best
he
had
to
offer
do
you
suppose
see
how
the
poor
boy
is
deteriorating
do
you
suppose
i
know
what
you
have
to
go
through
alice
and
when
i
think
of
that
man
upstairs
the
agitated
voice
grew
louder
when
i
think
of
him
and
know
that
nothing
in
the
world
but
his
stubbornness
keeps
my
children
from
having
all
they
want
and
what
they
ought
to
have
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
hold
myself
bound
to
keep
to
the
absolute
letter
of
a
silly
promise
he
got
from
me
by
behaving
like
a
crazy
man
i
ca
i
ca
do
it
no
mother
could
sit
by
and
see
him
lock
up
a
horn
of
plenty
like
that
in
his
closet
when
the
children
were
starving
oh
goodness
goodness
me
alice
protested
we
are
precisely
are
we
adams
began
to
weep
it
just
the
same
did
i
see
how
flushed
and
pretty
you
looked
this
afternoon
after
you
been
walking
with
this
young
man
that
come
here
do
you
suppose
he
look
at
a
girl
like
mildred
palmer
if
you
had
what
you
ought
to
have
do
you
suppose
he
be
going
into
business
with
her
father
if
your
father
good

than
walter
i
just
barely

the
man

so
absurd

always
adams
moaned
all
i
can
do
is
cry
while
your
father
sits
upstairs
and
his
horn
of
plenty
but
alice
interrupted
with
a
peal
of
desperate
laughter
oh
that
of
plenty
do
come
down
to
earth
mama
how
can
you
call
a
glue
factory
that
does
exist
except
in
your
mind
a
of
plenty
do
let
be
a
little
rational
it
could
be
a
horn
of
plenty
the
tearful
adams
insisted
it
could
you
do
understand
a
thing
about
well
i
willing
alice
said
with
tired
skepticism
make
me
understand
then
where
you
ever
get
the
idea
adams
withdrew
her
hands
from
the
water
dried
them
on
a
towel
and
then
wiped
her
eyes
with
a
handkerchief
your
father
could
make
a
fortune
if
he
wanted
to
she
said
quietly
at
least
i
do
say
a
fortune
but
anyhow
a
great
deal
more
than
he
does
yes
i
heard
that
before
mama
and
you
think
he
could
make
it
out
of
a
glue
factory
what
i
asking
is
how
how
why
by
making
glue
and
selling
it
do
you
know
how
bad
most
glue
is
when
you
try
to
mend
anything
a
good
glue
is
one
of
the
rarest
things
there
is
and
it
would
just
sell
itself
once
it
got
started
well
your
father
knows
how
to
make
as
good
a
glue
as
there
is
in
the
alice
was
not
interested
what
of
it
i
suppose
probably
anybody
could
make
it
if
they
wanted
i
said
you
did
know
anything
about
it
nobody
else
could
make
it
your
father
knows
a
formula
for
making
what
of
that
it
a
secret
formula
it
is
even
down
on
paper
it
worth
any
amount
of
amount
alice
said
remaining
incredulous
why
has
papa
sold
it
then
just
because
he
too
stubborn
to
do
anything
with
it
at
all
how
did
papa
get
it
he
got
it
before
you
were
born
just
after
we
were
married
i
think
much
about
it
then
it
was
till
you
were
growing
up
and
i
saw
how
much
we
needed
money
that
i
yes
but
how
did
papa
get
it
alice
began
to
feel
a
little
more
curious
about
this
possible
buried
treasure
did
he
invent
it
partly
adams
said
looking
somewhat
preoccupied
he
and
another
man
invented
then
maybe
the
other
man
he
then
his
family
i
do
think
he
left
any
family
adams
said
anyhow
it
belongs
to
your
father
at
least
it
belongs
to
him
as
much
as
it
does
to
any
one
else
he
got
an
absolutely
perfect
right
to
do
anything
he
wants
to
with
it
and
it
would
make
us
all
comfortable
if
he
do
what
i
want
him
to
and
he
knows
it
would
too
alice
shook
her
head
pityingly
poor
mama
she
said
of
course
he
knows
it
would
do
anything
of
the
kind
or
else
he
have
done
it
long
he
would
you
say
her
mother
cried
that
only
shows
how
little
you
know
him
poor
mama
alice
said
again
soothingly
if
papa
were
like
what
you
say
he
is
he
be
why
he
be
crazy
adams
agreed
with
a
vehemence
near
passion
you
right
about
him
for
once
that
just
what
he
is
he
sits
up
there
in
his
stubbornness
and
lets
us
slave
here
in
the
kitchen
when
if
he
wanted
to
if
he
so
much
as
lift
his
little
finger
oh
come
now
alice
laughed
you
ca
build
even
a
glue
factory
with
just
one
little
adams
seemed
about
to
reply
that
finding
fault
with
a
figure
of
speech
was
beside
the
point
but
a
ringing
of
the
front
door
bell
forestalled
the
retort
now
who
do
you
suppose
that
is
she
wondered
aloud
then
her
face
brightened
ah
did
russell
ask
if
he
could
no
he
would
be
coming
this
evening
alice
said
probably
it
the
great
j
lamb
he
usually
stops
for
a
minute
on
thursdays
to
ask
how
papa
getting
along
i
she
tossed
her
apron
off
and
as
she
went
through
the
house
her
expression
was
thoughtful
she
was
thinking
vaguely
about
the
glue
factory
and
wondering
if
there
might
be
something
in
it
after
all
if
her
mother
was
right
about
the
rich
possibilities
of
adams
secret
but
that
was
as
far
as
alice
speculations
upon
the
matter
went
at
this
time
they
were
checked
partly
by
the
thought
that
her
father
probably
had
enough
money
for
such
an
enterprise
and
partly
by
the
fact
that
she
had
arrived
at
the
front
door
chapter
xii
the
fine
old
gentleman
revealed
when
she
opened
the
door
was
probably
the
last
great
merchant
in
america
to
wear
the
chin
beard
white
as
white
frost
it
was
trimmed
short
with
exquisite
precision
while
his
upper
lip
and
the
lower
expanses
of
his
cheeks
were
clean
and
rosy
from
fresh
shaving
with
this
trim
white
chin
beard
the
white
waistcoat
the
white
tie
the
suit
of
fine
gray
cloth
the
broad
and
brilliantly
polished
black
shoes
and
the
gray
felt
hat
here
was
a
man
who
had
found
his
style
in
the
seventies
of
the
last
century
and
thenceforth
kept
it
files
of
old
magazines
of
that
period
might
show
him
in
woodcut
as
type
of
boston
merchant
nast
might
have
drawn
him
as
an
honest
statesman
he
was
eighty
hale
and
sturdy
not
aged
and
his
quick
blue
eyes
still
unflecked
and
as
brisk
as
a
boy
saw
everything
well
well
well
he
said
heartily
you
have
lost
any
of
your
good
looks
since
last
week
i
see
miss
alice
so
i
guess
i
to
take
it
you
have
been
worrying
over
your
daddy
the
young
feller
getting
along
all
right
is
he
he
much
better
he
sitting
up
lamb
wo
you
come
in
well
i
do
know
but
i
he
turned
to
call
toward
twin
disks
of
light
at
the
curb
be
out
in
a
minute
billy
and
the
silhouette
of
a
chauffeur
standing
beside
a
car
could
be
seen
to
salute
in
response
as
the
old
gentleman
stepped
into
the
hall
you
do
suppose
your
receiving
callers
yet
is
he
he
a
good
deal
stronger
than
he
was
when
you
were
here
last
week
but
i
afraid
he
not
very
presentable
the
old
man
echoed
her
jovially
pshaw
i
seen
lots
of
sick
folks
know
what
they
look
like
and
how
they
love
to
kind
of
nest
in
among
a
pile
of
old
blankets
and
wrappers
do
you
worry
about
that
miss
alice
if
you
think
he
like
to
see
of
course
he
would
if
alice
hesitated
then
said
quickly
of
course
he
love
to
see
you
and
he
quite
able
to
if
you
care
to
come
she
ran
up
the
stairs
ahead
of
him
and
had
time
to
snatch
the
crocheted
wrap
from
her
father
shoulders
swathed
as
usual
he
was
sitting
beside
a
table
reading
the
evening
paper
but
when
his
employer
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
half
rose
as
if
to
come
forward
in
greeting
sit
still
the
old
gentleman
shouted
what
do
you
mean
do
you
know
you
weak
as
a
cat
think
a
man
can
be
sick
as
long
as
you
have
and
not
be
weak
as
a
cat
what
you
trying
to
do
the
polite
with
me
for
adams
gratefully
protracted
the
handshake
that
accompanied
these
inquiries
this
is
certainly
mighty
fine
of
you
lamb
he
said
i
guess
alice
has
told
you
how
much
our
whole
family
appreciate
your
coming
here
so
regularly
to
see
how
this
old
bag
o
bones
was
getting
along
have
you
alice
yes
papa
she
said
and
turned
to
go
out
but
lamb
checked
her
stay
right
here
miss
alice
i
not
even
going
to
sit
down
i
know
how
it
upsets
sick
folks
when
people
outside
the
family
come
in
for
the
first
you
do
upset
me
adams
said
i
feel
a
lot
better
for
getting
a
glimpse
of
you
the
visitor
laugh
was
husky
but
hearty
and
like
his
voice
in
speaking
that
the
way
all
my
boys
blarney
me
miss
alice
he
said
they
think
i
make
the
work
lighter
on
if
they
can
get
me
kind
of
flattered
up
you
just
tell
your
daddy
it
no
use
he
does
get
on
my
soft
side
pretending
he
likes
to
see
me
even
when
he
oh
i
not
so
sick
any
more
adams
said
i
expect
to
be
back
in
my
place
ten
days
from
now
at
the
well
now
do
hurry
it
virgil
do
hurry
it
you
take
your
time
take
your
this
brought
to
adams
lips
a
feeble
smile
not
lacking
in
a
kind
of
vanity
as
feeble
why
he
asked
i
suppose
you
think
my
department
runs
itself
down
there
do
you
his
employer
response
was
another
husky
laugh
well
well
well
he
cried
and
patted
adams
shoulder
with
a
strong
pink
hand
listen
to
this
young
feller
miss
alice
will
you
he
thinks
we
ca
get
along
without
him
a
minute
yes
sir
this
daddy
of
yours
believes
the
whole
works
just
take
and
run
down
if
he
is
there
to
keep
wound
up
i
always
suspected
he
thought
a
good
deal
of
himself
and
now
i
know
he
does
adams
looked
troubled
well
i
do
like
to
feel
that
my
going
on
with
me
not
earning
listen
to
him
miss
alice
would
you
think
now
he
let
me
be
the
one
to
worry
about
that
why
on
my
word
if
your
daddy
had
his
way
would
be
anywhere
he
take
all
my
worrying
and
everything
else
off
my
shoulders
and
shove
me
right
out
of
lamb
and
company
he
would
it
seems
to
me
i
been
soldiering
on
you
a
pretty
long
while
lamb
the
convalescent
said
querulously
i
do
feel
right
about
it
but
i
be
back
in
ten
days
you
the
old
man
took
his
hand
in
parting
all
right
we
see
virgil
of
course
we
do
need
you
seriously
speaking
but
we
do
need
you
so
bad
we
let
you
come
down
there
before
you
fully
fit
and
he
went
to
the
door
you
hear
miss
alice
that
what
i
wanted
to
make
the
old
feller
understand
and
what
i
want
you
to
kind
of
enforce
on
him
the
old
place
is
there
waiting
for
him
and
it
wait
ten
years
if
it
took
him
that
long
to
get
good
and
well
you
see
that
he
remembers
it
miss
alice
she
went
down
the
stairs
with
him
and
he
continued
to
impress
this
upon
her
until
he
had
gone
out
of
the
front
door
and
even
after
that
the
husky
voice
called
back
from
the
darkness
as
he
went
to
his
car
forget
miss
alice
let
him
take
his
own
time
we
always
want
him
but
we
want
him
to
get
good
and
well
first
young
lady
when
she
closed
the
door
her
mother
came
from
the
farther
end
of
the
where
there
was
no
light
and
alice
turned
to
her
i
ca
help
liking
that
old
man
mama
she
said
he
always
sounds
so
well
so
solid
and
honest
and
friendly
i
do
like
but
adams
failed
in
sympathy
upon
this
point
he
did
say
anything
about
raising
your
father
salary
did
he
she
asked
dryly
no
i
thought
she
would
have
said
more
but
alice
indisposed
to
listen
began
to
whistle
ran
up
the
stairs
and
went
to
sit
with
her
father
she
found
him
with
the
excitement
a
first
caller
brings
into
a
slow
convalescence
his
cheeks
showed
actual
hints
of
colour
and
he
was
smiling
tremulously
as
he
filled
and
lit
his
pipe
she
brought
the
crocheted
scarf
and
put
it
about
his
shoulders
again
then
took
a
chair
near
him
i
believe
seeing
lamb
did
do
you
good
papa
she
said
i
sort
of
thought
it
might
and
that
why
i
let
him
come
up
you
really
look
a
little
like
your
old
self
adams
exhaled
a
breathy
ha
with
the
smoke
from
his
pipe
as
he
waved
the
match
to
extinguish
it
that
fine
he
said
the
smoke
i
had
before
dinner
did
taste
the
way
it
used
to
and
i
kind
of
wondered
if
i
lost
my
liking
for
tobacco
but
this
one
seems
to
be
all
right
you
bet
it
did
me
good
to
see
j
lamb
he
the
biggest
man
that
ever
lived
in
this
town
or
ever
will
live
here
and
you
can
take
all
the
governors
and
senators
or
anything
they
raised
here
and
put
in
a
pot
with
him
and
they
wo
come
out
alongside
o
him
and
to
think
as
big
a
man
as
that
with
all
his
interests
and
everything
he
got
on
his
mind
to
think
he
never
let
anything
prevent
him
from
coming
here
once
every
week
to
ask
how
i
was
getting
along
and
then
walk
right
upstairs
and
kind
of
call
on
me
as
it
were
well
it
makes
me
sort
of
feel
as
if
i
was
so
much
of
a
nobody
so
to
speak
as
your
mother
seems
to
like
to
make
out
how
foolish
papa
of
course
you
not
nobody
adams
chuckled
faintly
upon
his
what
vanity
he
had
seeming
to
be
further
stimulated
by
his
daughter
applause
i
guess
there
a
whole
lot
of
people
in
this
town
that
could
claim
j
showed
that
much
interest
in
he
said
of
course
i
do
set
up
to
believe
it
all
because
of
merit
or
anything
like
that
he
do
the
same
for
anybody
else
that
been
with
the
company
as
long
as
i
have
but
still
it
is
something
to
be
with
the
company
that
long
and
have
him
show
he
appreciates
yes
indeed
it
is
yes
sir
adams
said
reflectively
yes
sir
i
guess
that
so
and
besides
it
all
goes
to
show
the
kind
of
a
man
he
is
simon
pure
what
that
man
is
alice
simon
pure
there
never
been
anybody
work
for
him
that
did
respect
him
more
than
they
did
any
other
man
in
the
world
i
guess
and
when
you
work
for
him
you
know
he
respects
you
too
right
from
the
start
you
get
the
feeling
that
j
puts
absolute
confidence
in
you
and
that
mighty
stimulating
it
makes
you
want
to
show
him
he
has
misplaced
it
there
great
big
moral
values
to
the
way
a
man
like
him
gets
you
to
feeling
about
your
relations
with
the
business
it
ai
all
just
dollars
and
cents
not
by
any
means
he
was
silent
for
a
time
then
returned
with
increasing
enthusiasm
to
this
theme
and
alice
was
glad
to
see
so
much
renewal
of
life
in
him
he
had
not
spoken
with
a
like
cheerful
vigour
since
before
his
illness
the
visit
of
his
idolized
great
man
had
indeed
been
good
for
him
putting
new
spirit
into
him
and
liveliness
of
the
body
followed
that
of
the
spirit
his
improvement
carried
over
the
night
he
slept
well
and
awoke
late
declaring
that
he
was
pretty
near
a
well
man
and
ready
for
business
right
moreover
having
slept
again
in
the
afternoon
he
dressed
and
went
down
to
dinner
leaning
but
lightly
on
alice
who
conducted
him
my
but
you
and
your
mother
have
been
at
it
with
your
scrubbing
and
dusting
he
said
as
they
came
through
the
i
do
know
i
ever
did
see
the
house
so
spick
and
span
before
his
glance
fell
upon
a
few
carnations
in
a
vase
and
he
chuckled
admiringly
flowers
too
so
that
what
you
coaxed
that
dollar
and
a
half
out
o
for
this
morning
other
embellishments
brought
forth
his
comment
when
he
had
taken
his
old
seat
at
the
head
of
the
small
why
i
declare
alice
he
exclaimed
i
been
so
busy
looking
at
all
the
after
the
and
the
flowers
out
in
the
parlour
room
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
call
it
if
i
just
got
to
be
fashionable
i
been
so
busy
studying
over
all
this
i
declare
i
never
noticed
you
till
this
minute
my
but
you
are
all
dressed
up
what
goin
on
what
it
about
you
so
all
dressed
up
and
flowers
in
the
parlour
and
everything
do
you
see
papa
it
in
honour
of
your
coming
downstairs
again
of
oh
so
that
it
he
said
i
never
would
thought
of
that
i
but
walter
looked
sidelong
at
his
father
and
gave
forth
his
sly
and
knowing
laugh
neither
would
i
he
said
adams
lifted
his
eyebrows
jocosely
you
jealous
are
you
sonny
you
do
want
the
old
man
to
think
our
young
lady
make
so
much
fuss
over
him
do
you
go
on
thinkin
it
over
you
walter
retorted
amused
go
on
and
think
it
it
do
you
of
course
i
think
it
adams
said
it
is
anybody
birthday
certainly
the
decorations
are
on
account
of
me
coming
downstairs
you
hear
alice
say
so
sure
i
heard
her
say
well
then
walter
interrupted
him
with
a
little
music
looking
shrewdly
at
alice
he
sang
i
was
walkin
out
on
monday
with
my
sweet
thing
she
my
neat
thing
my
sweet
thing
i
go
round
on
tuesday
night
to
see
her
oh
how
we
spoon
walter
his
mother
cried
where
do
you
learn
such
vulgar
songs
however
she
seemed
not
greatly
displeased
with
him
and
laughed
as
she
spoke
so
that
it
alice
said
adams
playing
the
hypocrite
with
your
old
man
are
you
it
some
new
beau
is
it
i
only
wish
it
were
she
said
calmly
no
it
just
what
i
said
it
all
for
you
do
let
her
con
you
walter
advised
his
father
she
got
expectations
you
hang
around
downstairs
a
while
after
dinner
and
but
the
prophecy
failed
though
adams
went
to
his
own
room
without
waiting
to
test
it
no
one
came
alice
stayed
in
the
until
nine
when
she
went
slowly
upstairs
her
mother
almost
tearful
met
her
at
the
top
and
whispered
you
must
mind
must
mind
what
alice
asked
and
then
as
she
went
on
her
way
laughed
scornfully
what
utter
nonsense
she
said
next
day
she
cut
the
stems
of
the
rather
scant
show
of
carnations
and
refreshed
them
with
new
water
at
dinner
her
father
still
in
high
spirits
observed
that
she
had
again
dressed
up
in
honour
of
his
second
descent
of
the
stairs
and
walter
repeated
his
fragment
of
objectionable
song
but
these
jocularities
were
rendered
pointless
by
the
eventless
evening
that
followed
and
in
the
morning
the
carnations
began
to
appear
tarnished
and
flaccid
alice
gave
them
a
long
look
then
threw
them
away
and
neither
walter
nor
her
father
was
inspired
to
any
rallying
by
her
plain
costume
for
that
evening
adams
was
visibly
depressed
when
alice
finished
helping
her
mother
with
the
dishes
she
went
outdoors
and
sat
upon
the
steps
of
the
little
front
veranda
the
night
gentle
with
warm
air
from
the
south
surrounded
her
pleasantly
and
the
perpetual
smoke
was
thinner
now
that
the
furnaces
of
were
no
longer
fired
life
in
that
city
had
begun
to
be
less
like
life
in
a
railway
tunnel
people
were
aware
of
summer
in
the
air
and
in
the
thickened
foliage
of
the
and
in
the
sky
stars
were
unveiled
by
the
passing
of
the
denser
smoke
fogs
and
they
could
be
seen
clearly
they
looked
warm
and
near
other
girls
sat
upon
verandas
and
stoops
in
alice
street
cheerful
as
young
fishermen
along
the
banks
of
a
stream
alice
could
hear
them
from
time
to
time
thin
sopranos
persistent
in
laughter
that
fell
dismally
upon
her
ears
she
had
set
no
lines
or
nets
herself
and
what
she
had
of
expectations
as
walter
called
them
were
vanished
for
alice
was
experienced
and
one
of
the
conclusions
she
drew
from
her
experience
was
that
when
a
man
says
i
take
you
for
anything
you
wanted
me
to
he
may
mean
it
or
he
may
not
but
if
he
does
he
will
not
postpone
the
first
opportunity
to
say
something
more
little
affairs
once
begun
must
be
warmed
quickly
for
if
they
cool
they
are
dead
but
alice
was
not
thinking
of
arthur
russell
when
she
tossed
away
the
carnations
she
likewise
tossed
away
her
thoughts
of
that
young
man
she
had
been
like
a
boy
who
sees
upon
the
street
some
distance
before
him
a
bit
of
something
round
and
glittering
a
possible
dime
he
hopes
it
is
a
dime
and
until
he
comes
near
enough
to
make
sure
he
plays
that
it
is
a
dime
in
his
mind
he
has
an
adventure
with
it
he
buys
something
delightful
if
he
picks
it
up
discovering
only
some
which
has
happened
upon
a
round
shape
he
feels
a
sinking
a
dulness
falls
upon
him
so
alice
was
dull
with
the
loss
of
an
adventure
and
when
the
laughter
of
other
girls
reached
her
intermittently
she
had
not
sprightliness
enough
left
in
her
to
be
envious
of
their
gaiety
besides
these
neighbours
were
ineligible
even
for
her
envy
being
of
another
caste
they
could
never
know
a
dance
at
the
palmers
except
remotely
through
a
newspaper
their
laughter
was
for
the
encouragement
of
snappy
young
men
of
the
stores
and
offices
clerks
bookkeepers
what
not
some
of
them
probably
graduates
of
frincke
business
college
then
as
she
recalled
that
dark
portal
with
its
dusty
stairway
mounting
between
close
walls
to
disappear
in
the
upper
shadows
her
mind
drew
back
as
from
a
doorway
to
purgatory
nevertheless
it
was
a
picture
often
in
her
reverie
and
sometimes
it
came
suddenly
without
sequence
into
the
midst
of
her
other
thoughts
as
if
it
leaped
up
among
them
from
a
lower
darkness
and
when
it
arrived
it
wanted
to
stay
so
a
traveller
still
roaming
the
world
afar
sometimes
broods
without
apparent
reason
upon
his
family
burial
lot
i
wonder
if
i
shall
end
the
foreboding
passed
abruptly
with
a
jerk
of
her
breath
as
the
revealed
a
tall
and
easy
figure
approaching
from
the
north
swinging
a
stick
in
time
to
its
stride
she
had
given
russell
up
and
he
came
what
luck
for
me
he
exclaimed
to
find
you
alone
alice
gave
him
her
hand
for
an
instant
not
otherwise
moving
i
glad
it
happened
so
she
said
let
stay
out
here
shall
we
do
you
think
it
too
provincial
to
sit
on
a
girl
front
steps
with
her
why
it
the
very
best
of
our
institutions
he
returned
taking
his
place
beside
her
at
least
i
think
so
thanks
is
that
practice
for
other
nights
somewhere
else
no
he
laughed
the
practicing
all
led
up
to
this
did
i
come
too
soon
no
she
replied
gravely
just
in
time
i
glad
to
be
so
accurate
i
spent
two
evenings
wanting
to
come
miss
adams
instead
of
doing
what
i
was
what
was
that
dinners
large
and
long
dinners
your
are
immensely
hospitable
to
a
oh
no
alice
said
we
do
do
it
for
everybody
did
you
find
yourself
charmed
one
was
a
men
dinner
he
explained
mr
palmer
seemed
to
think
i
ought
to
be
shown
to
the
principal
business
what
was
the
other
dinner
my
cousin
mildred
gave
oh
did
she
alice
said
sharply
but
she
recovered
herself
in
the
same
instant
and
laughed
she
wanted
to
show
you
to
the
principal
business
women
i
i
do
know
at
all
events
i
should
give
myself
out
to
be
so
much
feted
by
your
after
all
seeing
these
were
both
done
by
my
relatives
the
palmers
however
there
are
others
to
follow
afraid
i
was
wondering
i
hoped
maybe
you
be
coming
to
some
of
them
are
you
i
rather
doubt
it
alice
said
slowly
mildred
dance
was
almost
the
only
evening
i
gone
out
since
my
father
illness
began
he
seemed
better
that
day
so
i
went
he
was
better
the
other
day
when
he
wanted
those
cigars
he
very
much
up
and
she
paused
i
almost
forgotten
that
mildred
is
your
not
a
very
near
one
he
explained
mr
palmer
father
was
my
still
of
course
you
are
yes
that
alice
said
placidly
it
quite
an
he
agreed
yes
it
no
she
said
in
the
same
placid
tone
i
mean
for
i
do
see
she
laughed
no
you
would
i
mean
it
an
advantage
over
the
rest
of
us
who
might
like
to
compete
for
some
of
your
time
and
the
worst
of
it
is
we
ca
accuse
her
of
being
unfair
about
it
we
ca
prove
she
showed
any
trickiness
in
having
you
for
a
cousin
whatever
else
she
might
plan
to
do
with
you
she
did
plan
that
so
the
rest
of
us
must
just
bear
it
the
of
you
he
laughed
it
going
to
mean
a
great
deal
of
suffering
alice
resumed
her
placid
tone
you
staying
at
the
palmers
you
no
not
now
i
taken
an
apartment
i
going
to
live
here
permanent
did
i
tell
you
i
think
i
heard
somewhere
that
you
were
she
said
do
you
think
you
like
living
here
how
can
one
tell
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
think
i
should
be
able
to
tell
how
why
good
gracious
she
cried
have
you
got
the
most
perfect
creature
in
town
for
your
your
cousin
she
expects
to
make
you
like
living
here
does
she
how
could
you
keep
from
liking
it
even
if
you
tried
not
to
under
the
circumstances
well
you
see
there
such
a
lot
of
circumstances
he
explained
not
sure
i
like
getting
back
into
a
business
again
i
suppose
most
of
the
men
of
my
age
in
the
country
have
been
going
through
the
same
experience
the
war
left
us
with
a
considerable
restlessness
of
you
were
in
the
war
she
asked
quickly
and
as
quickly
answered
herself
of
course
you
were
i
was
a
they
only
let
me
out
about
four
months
ago
he
said
it
quite
a
trying
to
settle
down
you
were
in
france
then
oh
yes
but
i
did
get
up
to
the
front
much
only
two
or
three
times
and
then
just
for
a
day
or
so
i
was
in
the
transportation
you
were
an
officer
of
yes
he
said
they
let
me
play
i
was
a
i
guessed
a
major
she
said
you
always
be
pretty
grand
of
russell
was
amused
well
you
see
he
informed
her
as
it
happened
we
had
at
least
several
other
majors
in
our
army
why
would
i
always
be
something
grand
you
related
to
the
palmers
do
you
notice
they
always
affect
the
pretty
grand
then
you
think
i
only
one
of
their
affectations
i
take
yes
you
seem
to
be
the
most
successful
one
they
got
alice
said
lightly
you
certainly
do
belong
to
and
she
laughed
as
if
at
something
hidden
from
him
do
you
but
you
just
excused
me
for
that
he
protested
you
said
nobody
could
be
blamed
for
my
being
their
third
cousin
what
a
contradictory
girl
you
are
alice
shook
her
head
let
keep
away
from
the
kind
of
girl
i
no
he
said
that
just
what
i
came
here
to
talk
she
shook
her
head
again
let
keep
first
to
the
kind
of
man
you
are
i
glad
you
were
in
the
why
oh
i
do
she
was
quiet
a
moment
for
she
was
thinking
that
here
she
spoke
the
truth
his
service
put
about
him
a
little
glamour
that
helped
to
please
her
with
him
she
had
been
pleased
with
him
during
their
walk
pleased
with
him
on
his
own
account
and
now
that
pleasure
was
growing
keener
she
looked
at
him
and
though
the
light
in
which
she
saw
him
was
little
more
than
starlight
she
saw
that
he
was
looking
steadily
at
her
with
a
kindly
and
smiling
seriousness
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
night
air
was
sweeter
to
breathe
as
if
a
distant
fragrance
of
new
blossoms
had
been
blown
to
her
she
smiled
back
to
him
and
said
well
what
kind
of
man
are
you
i
do
know
i
often
wondered
he
replied
what
kind
of
girl
are
you
do
you
remember
i
told
you
the
other
day
i
just
me
but
who
is
that
you
forget
everything
said
alice
you
told
me
what
kind
of
a
girl
i
am
you
seemed
to
think
you
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
me
from
the
very
so
i
did
he
agreed
heartily
but
how
quickly
you
forgot
it
oh
no
i
only
want
you
to
say
what
kind
of
a
girl
you
she
mocked
him
do
know
i
often
wondered
what
kind
of
a
girl
does
mildred
tell
you
i
am
what
has
she
said
about
me
since
she
told
you
i
was
miss
adams
i
do
know
i
have
asked
then
do
ask
her
alice
said
quickly
why
because
she
such
a
perfect
creature
and
i
such
an
imperfect
one
perfect
creatures
have
the
most
perfect
way
of
ruining
the
imperfect
but
then
they
would
be
perfect
not
if
they
oh
yes
they
remain
perfectly
perfect
she
assured
him
because
they
never
go
into
details
they
not
so
vulgar
as
to
come
right
out
and
tell
that
you
been
in
jail
for
stealing
chickens
they
just
look
and
say
in
a
low
voice
very
but
i
scarcely
think
you
like
her
particularly
and
then
begin
to
talk
of
something
else
right
his
smile
had
disappeared
yes
he
said
somewhat
ruefully
that
does
sound
like
mildred
you
certainly
do
seem
to
know
her
do
you
know
everybody
as
well
as
that
not
myself
alice
said
i
do
know
myself
at
all
i
got
to
wondering
about
that
about
who
i
was
the
other
day
after
you
walked
home
with
he
uttered
an
exclamation
and
added
explaining
it
you
do
give
a
man
a
chance
to
be
fatuous
though
as
if
it
were
walking
home
with
me
that
made
you
wonder
about
yourself
it
was
alice
informed
him
coolly
i
was
wondering
what
i
wanted
to
make
you
think
of
me
in
case
i
should
ever
happen
to
see
you
this
audacity
appeared
to
take
his
breath
by
george
he
cried
you
must
be
astonished
she
said
what
i
decided
then
was
that
i
would
probably
never
dare
to
be
just
myself
with
you
not
if
i
cared
to
have
you
want
to
see
me
again
and
yet
here
i
am
just
being
myself
after
all
you
are
the
cheeriest
series
of
shocks
russell
exclaimed
whereupon
alice
added
to
the
series
tell
me
is
it
a
good
policy
for
me
to
follow
with
you
she
asked
and
he
found
the
mockery
in
her
voice
delightful
would
you
advise
me
to
offer
you
shocks
as
a
sort
of
vacation
from
suavity
suavity
was
yet
another
sketch
of
mildred
a
recognizable
one
or
it
would
not
have
been
humorous
in
alice
hands
so
dexterous
in
this
work
her
statuesque
friend
was
becoming
as
ridiculous
as
a
fine
figure
of
wax
left
to
the
mercies
of
a
satirist
but
the
lively
young
sculptress
knew
better
than
to
overdo
what
she
did
must
appear
to
spring
all
from
mirth
so
she
laughed
as
if
unwillingly
and
said
i
must
laugh
at
mildred
in
the
first
place
your
your
cousin
and
in
the
second
place
she
not
meant
to
be
funny
it
is
right
to
laugh
at
really
splendid
people
who
take
themselves
seriously
in
the
third
place
you
wo
come
again
if
i
do
be
sure
of
that
russell
said
whatever
you
i
do
she
echoed
that
sounds
as
if
you
thought
i
could
be
terrific
be
careful
there
one
thing
i
could
do
that
would
keep
you
what
that
i
could
tell
you
not
to
come
she
said
i
wonder
if
i
ought
why
do
you
wonder
if
you
to
do
you
guess
then
let
both
be
mysteries
to
each
other
she
suggested
i
mystify
you
because
i
wonder
and
you
mystify
me
because
you
do
guess
why
i
wonder
we
let
it
go
at
that
shall
we
very
well
so
long
as
it
certain
that
you
do
tell
me
not
to
come
i
not
tell
you
that
yet
she
said
in
fact
she
paused
reflecting
with
her
head
to
one
side
in
fact
i
wo
tell
you
not
to
come
probably
until
i
see
that
what
you
want
me
to
tell
you
i
let
you
out
easily
and
i
be
sure
to
see
it
even
before
you
do
that
arrangement
suits
me
russell
returned
and
his
voice
held
no
trace
of
jocularity
he
had
become
serious
it
suits
me
better
if
you
enough
in
earnest
to
mean
that
i
can
come
oh
not
whenever
i
want
to
i
do
expect
so
much
but
if
you
mean
that
i
can
see
you
pretty
of
course
i
in
earnest
she
said
but
before
i
say
you
can
come
often
i
like
to
know
how
much
of
my
time
you
need
if
you
did
come
you
want
to
and
of
course
you
would
dare
make
any
answer
to
that
question
except
one
would
you
let
me
have
thursdays
out
no
no
he
protested
i
want
to
know
will
you
let
me
come
pretty
often
lean
toward
me
a
little
alice
said
i
want
you
to
and
as
he
obediently
bent
his
head
near
hers
she
inclined
toward
him
as
if
to
whisper
then
in
a
she
cried
yes
he
clapped
his
hands
by
george
he
said
what
a
girl
you
are
why
well
for
the
first
reason
because
you
have
such
gaieties
as
that
one
i
should
think
your
father
would
actually
like
being
ill
just
to
be
in
the
house
with
you
all
the
you
mean
by
that
alice
inquired
i
keep
my
family
cheerful
with
my
amusing
little
ways
yes
do
you
there
were
only
boys
in
your
family
were
there
russell
i
was
an
only
child
yes
she
said
i
see
you
had
any
for
a
moment
he
puzzled
over
her
meaning
then
saw
it
and
was
more
delighted
with
her
than
ever
i
can
answer
a
question
of
yours
now
that
i
could
a
while
yes
i
know
she
returned
quietly
but
how
could
you
know
it
the
question
i
asked
you
about
whether
you
were
going
to
like
living
here
she
said
you
about
to
tell
me
that
now
you
know
you
will
like
more
telepathy
he
exclaimed
yes
that
was
it
precisely
i
suppose
the
same
thing
been
said
to
you
so
many
times
that
you
no
it
has
alice
said
a
little
confused
for
the
moment
not
at
all
i
meant
she
paused
then
asked
in
a
gentle
voice
would
you
really
like
to
know
well
then
i
was
only
afraid
you
did
mean
see
here
he
said
i
did
mean
it
i
told
you
it
was
being
pretty
difficult
for
me
to
settle
down
to
things
again
well
it
more
difficult
than
you
know
but
i
think
i
can
pull
through
in
fair
spirits
if
i
can
see
a
girl
like
you
often
all
right
she
said
in
a
tone
i
told
you
that
you
can
if
you
want
i
do
want
to
he
assured
her
i
do
indeed
how
often
is
often
russell
would
you
walk
with
me
sometimes
sometimes
not
the
day
that
splendid
he
said
you
walk
with
me
day
after
and
the
night
after
that
i
see
you
at
miss
lamb
dance
wo
i
but
this
fell
rather
chillingly
upon
alice
miss
lamb
dance
which
miss
lamb
she
asked
i
do
know
it
the
one
that
just
coming
out
of
oh
henrietta
yes
is
her
dance
so
soon
i
you
be
there
wo
you
he
asked
please
say
you
alice
did
not
respond
at
once
and
he
urged
her
again
please
do
promise
you
be
no
i
ca
promise
anything
she
said
slowly
you
see
for
one
thing
papa
might
not
be
well
but
if
he
is
said
russell
if
he
is
you
surely
come
wo
you
or
perhaps
he
hesitated
then
went
on
quickly
i
do
know
the
rules
in
this
place
yet
and
different
places
have
different
rules
but
do
you
have
to
have
a
chaperone
or
do
girls
just
go
to
dances
with
the
men
sometimes
if
they
do
would
you
would
you
let
me
take
you
alice
was
startled
good
gracious
what
the
matter
do
you
think
your
relatives
are
you
expected
to
go
with
mildred
and
palmer
not
necessarily
it
does
matter
what
i
might
be
expected
to
do
he
said
will
you
go
with
me
i
no
i
why
not
i
ca
i
not
but
why
papa
not
really
any
better
alice
said
huskily
i
too
worried
about
him
to
go
to
a
her
voice
sounded
emotional
genuinely
enough
there
was
something
almost
like
a
sob
in
it
let
talk
of
other
things
he
acquiesced
gently
but
adams
who
had
been
listening
to
the
conversation
at
the
open
window
just
overhead
did
not
hear
him
she
had
correctly
interpreted
the
sob
in
alice
voice
and
trembling
with
sudden
anger
she
rose
from
her
knees
and
went
fiercely
to
her
husband
room
chapter
xiii
he
had
not
undressed
and
he
sat
beside
the
table
smoking
his
pipe
and
reading
his
newspaper
upon
his
forehead
the
lines
in
that
old
pattern
the
historical
map
of
his
troubles
had
grown
a
little
vaguer
lately
relaxed
by
the
complacency
of
a
man
who
not
only
finds
his
health
restored
but
sees
the
days
before
him
promising
once
more
a
familiar
routine
that
he
has
always
liked
to
follow
as
his
wife
came
in
closing
the
door
behind
her
he
looked
up
cheerfully
well
mother
he
said
what
the
news
downstairs
that
what
i
came
to
tell
you
she
informed
him
grimly
adams
lowered
his
newspaper
to
his
knee
and
peered
over
his
spectacles
at
her
she
had
remained
by
the
door
standing
and
the
great
greenish
shadow
of
the
small
upon
his
table
revealed
her
but
dubiously
is
everything
all
right
he
asked
what
the
matter
do
worry
i
going
to
tell
you
she
said
her
grimness
not
relaxed
there
matter
enough
virgil
adams
matter
enough
to
make
me
sick
of
being
alive
with
that
the
markings
on
his
brows
began
to
emerge
again
in
all
their
sharpness
the
old
pattern
reappeared
oh
my
my
he
lamented
i
thought
maybe
we
were
all
going
to
settle
down
to
a
little
peace
for
a
while
what
it
about
now
it
about
alice
did
you
think
it
was
about
me
or
anything
for
myself
like
some
ready
old
machine
always
in
order
his
irritability
responded
immediately
and
automatically
to
her
emotion
how
in
thunder
could
i
think
what
it
about
or
who
it
for
say
it
and
get
it
over
oh
i
it
she
promised
ominously
what
i
come
to
ask
you
is
how
much
longer
do
you
expect
me
to
put
up
with
that
old
man
and
his
doings
whose
doings
what
old
man
she
came
at
him
fiercely
accusing
you
know
well
enough
what
old
man
virgil
adams
that
old
man
who
was
here
the
other
mr
lamb
yes
lamb
she
mocked
his
voice
what
other
old
man
would
i
be
likely
to
mean
except
j
lamb
what
he
been
doing
now
her
husband
inquired
satirically
you
get
something
new
against
him
since
the
last
time
you
just
this
she
cried
the
other
night
when
that
man
was
here
if
known
how
he
was
going
to
make
my
child
suffer
i
never
have
let
him
set
his
foot
in
my
adams
leaned
back
in
his
chair
as
though
her
absurdity
had
eased
his
mind
oh
i
see
he
said
you
just
gone
plain
crazy
that
the
only
explanation
of
such
talk
and
it
suits
the
has
that
man
made
us
all
suffer
every
day
of
our
lives
she
demanded
i
like
to
know
why
it
is
that
my
life
and
my
lives
have
to
be
sacrificed
to
him
how
are
they
to
him
because
you
keep
on
working
for
him
because
you
keep
on
letting
him
hand
out
whatever
miserable
little
pittance
he
chooses
to
give
you
that
why
it
as
if
he
were
some
horrible
old
juggernaut
and
i
had
to
see
my
children
own
father
throwing
them
under
the
wheels
to
keep
him
i
wo
hear
any
more
such
stuff
lifting
his
paper
adams
affected
to
read
you
better
listen
to
me
she
admonished
him
you
might
be
sorry
you
did
in
case
he
ever
tried
to
set
foot
in
my
house
again
i
might
tell
him
to
his
face
what
i
think
of
at
this
adams
slapped
the
newspaper
down
upon
his
knee
oh
the
devil
what
it
matter
what
you
think
of
him
it
had
better
matter
to
you
she
cried
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
submit
forever
to
him
and
his
family
and
what
they
doing
to
my
child
what
are
he
and
his
family
doing
to
child
adams
came
out
with
it
that
snippy
little
henrietta
lamb
has
always
snubbed
alice
every
time
she
ever
had
the
chance
followed
the
lead
of
the
other
girls
they
always
all
of
been
jealous
of
alice
because
she
dared
to
try
and
be
happy
and
because
she
showier
and
than
they
are
even
though
you
do
give
her
only
about
cents
a
year
to
do
it
on
they
all
done
everything
on
earth
they
could
to
drive
the
young
men
away
from
her
and
belittle
her
to
and
this
mean
little
henrietta
lamb
been
the
worst
of
the
whole
crowd
to
alice
every
time
she
could
see
a
what
for
adams
asked
incredulously
why
should
she
or
anybody
else
pick
on
alice
for
his
wife
repeated
with
a
greater
vehemence
do
you
ask
me
such
a
thing
as
that
do
you
really
want
to
know
yes
i
want
to
know
i
would
if
i
believed
then
i
tell
you
she
said
in
a
cold
fury
it
on
account
of
you
virgil
and
nothing
else
in
the
he
hooted
at
her
oh
yes
these
girls
do
like
me
so
they
pick
on
quit
your
palavering
and
evading
she
said
a
crowd
of
girls
like
that
when
they
get
a
pretty
girl
like
alice
among
them
they
act
just
like
wild
beasts
they
tear
her
to
pieces
or
else
they
chase
her
and
run
her
out
because
they
know
if
she
had
half
a
chance
outshine
they
ca
do
that
to
a
girl
like
mildred
palmer
because
she
got
money
and
family
to
back
her
now
you
listen
to
me
virgil
adams
the
way
the
world
is
now
money
is
family
alice
would
have
just
as
much
as
any
of
every
single
bit
if
you
had
fallen
behind
in
the
how
did
i
yes
you
did
she
cried
years
ago
when
we
were
starting
and
this
town
was
smaller
you
and
i
could
have
gone
with
any
of
if
we
tried
hard
enough
look
at
the
people
we
knew
then
that
do
hold
their
heads
up
alongside
of
anybody
in
this
town
why
can
they
because
the
men
of
those
families
made
money
and
gave
their
children
everything
that
makes
life
worth
living
why
ca
we
hold
our
heads
up
because
those
men
passed
you
in
the
race
they
went
up
the
ladder
and
you
you
still
a
clerk
down
at
that
old
hole
you
leave
that
out
please
he
said
i
thought
you
were
going
to
tell
me
something
henrietta
lamb
had
done
to
our
you
bet
i
going
to
tell
you
she
assured
him
vehemently
but
first
i
telling
why
she
does
it
it
because
you
never
given
alice
any
backing
nor
any
background
and
they
all
know
they
can
do
anything
they
like
to
her
with
perfect
impunity
if
she
had
the
hundredth
part
of
what
they
have
to
fall
back
on
she
have
made
sing
a
mighty
different
song
long
ago
how
would
she
oh
my
heavens
but
you
slow
adams
moaned
look
here
you
remember
how
practically
all
the
nicest
boys
in
this
town
used
to
come
here
a
few
years
ago
why
they
were
all
crazy
over
her
and
the
girls
had
to
be
nice
to
her
then
look
at
the
difference
now
there
be
a
whole
month
go
by
and
not
a
young
man
come
to
call
on
her
let
alone
send
her
candy
or
flowers
or
ever
think
of
taking
her
any
place
and
yet
she
prettier
and
brighter
than
she
was
when
they
used
to
come
it
is
the
child
fault
she
could
hold
is
it
poor
thing
she
tried
hard
enough
i
suppose
you
say
it
was
her
fault
no
i
then
whose
fault
is
it
oh
mine
mine
he
said
wearily
i
drove
the
young
men
away
of
you
might
as
well
have
driven
virgil
it
amounts
to
just
the
same
how
does
it
because
as
they
got
older
a
good
many
of
began
to
think
more
about
money
that
one
thing
money
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
for
that
matter
look
at
these
country
clubs
and
all
such
things
the
other
girls
families
belong
and
we
do
and
alice
do
and
she
ca
go
unless
somebody
takes
her
and
nobody
does
any
more
look
at
the
other
girls
houses
and
then
look
at
our
house
so
shabby
and
she
be
pretty
near
ashamed
to
ask
anybody
to
come
in
and
sit
down
nowadays
look
at
her
clothes
oh
yes
you
think
you
shelled
out
a
lot
for
that
little
coat
of
hers
and
the
hat
and
skirt
she
got
last
march
but
it
nothing
some
of
these
girls
nowadays
spend
more
than
your
whole
salary
on
their
clothes
and
what
jewellery
has
she
got
a
plated
watch
and
two
or
three
little
pins
and
rings
of
the
kind
people
maids
would
wear
now
good
lord
virgil
adams
wake
up
do
sit
there
and
tell
me
you
do
know
things
like
this
mean
suffering
for
the
child
he
had
begun
to
rub
his
hands
wretchedly
back
and
forth
over
his
bony
knees
as
if
in
that
way
he
somewhat
alleviated
the
tedium
caused
by
her
racking
voice
oh
my
my
he
muttered
oh
my
my
yes
i
should
think
you
would
say
my
my
she
took
him
up
loudly
that
does
help
things
much
if
you
ever
wanted
to
do
anything
about
it
the
poor
child
might
see
some
gleam
of
hope
in
her
life
you
do
care
for
her
that
the
trouble
you
do
care
a
single
thing
about
i
do
no
you
do
why
even
with
your
miserable
little
salary
you
could
have
given
her
more
than
you
have
you
the
closest
man
i
ever
knew
it
like
pulling
teeth
to
get
a
dollar
out
of
you
for
her
now
and
then
and
yet
you
hide
some
away
every
month
or
so
in
some
wretched
little
investment
or
other
you
look
here
now
he
interrupted
angrily
you
look
here
if
i
put
a
little
by
whenever
i
could
in
a
bond
or
something
where
would
you
be
if
anything
happened
to
me
the
insurance
doctors
never
passed
me
you
know
that
have
we
got
to
have
something
to
fall
back
on
yes
we
have
she
cried
we
ought
to
have
something
to
go
on
with
right
now
too
when
we
need
it
do
you
suppose
these
snippets
would
treat
alice
the
way
they
do
if
she
could
afford
to
entertain
they
leave
her
out
of
their
dinners
and
dances
simply
because
they
know
she
give
any
dinners
and
dances
to
leave
them
out
of
they
know
she
get
even
and
that
the
whole
story
that
why
henrietta
lamb
done
this
thing
to
her
adams
had
gone
back
to
his
rubbing
of
his
knees
oh
my
my
he
said
what
thing
she
told
him

dear
grand
old
mister

with
him
though
she
give
anything
in
the
world
to
do
it

you
understand
the
reason
she
ca
is
because
henrietta
lamb
has
invited
her
do
you
want
to
know
why
henrietta
has
invited
her
it
because
she
knows
alice
ca
get
even
and
because
she
thinks
alice
ought
to
be
snubbed
like
this
on
account
of
only
being
the
daughter
of
one
of
her
grandfather
clerks
i
hope

my
he

has
been
left
out
of
a
good
many
smaller
things
like
big
dinners
and
little
dances
but
this
is
just
the
same
as
serving
her
notice
that
she
out
of
everything
and
it
all
done
by
your
dear
grand
old
look
here
adams
exclaimed
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
of
that
you
ca
hold
him
responsible
for
everything
his
grandchildren
do
i
guess
he
probably
does
know
a
thing
about
it
you
do
suppose
troubling
his
head
over
but
she
burst
out
at
him
passionately
suppose
you
trouble
your
head
about
it
you
better
virgil
adams
you
better
unless
you
want
to
see
your
child
just
dry
up
into
a
miserable
old
maid
she
still
young
and
she
has
a
chance
for
happiness
if
she
had
a
father
that
bring
a
millstone
to
hang
around
her
neck
instead
of
what
he
ought
to
give
her
you
just
wait
till
you
die
and
god
asks
you
what
you
had
in
your
breast
instead
of
a
heart
oh
my
my
he
groaned
what
my
heart
got
to
do
with
it
nothing
you
have
got
one
or
you
give
her
what
she
needed
am
i
asking
anything
you
ca
do
you
know
better
you
know
i
not
at
this
he
sat
suddenly
rigid
his
troubled
hands
ceasing
to
rub
his
knees
and
he
looked
at
her
fixedly
now
tell
me
he
said
slowly
just
what
are
you
asking
you
know
she
sobbed
you
mean
you
broken
your
word
never
to
speak
of
that
to
me
again
what
do
care
for
my
word
she
cried
and
sinking
to
the
floor
at
his
feet
rocked
herself
back
and
forth
there
do
you
suppose
let
my
keep
me
from
struggling
for
a
little
happiness
for
my
children
it
wo
i
tell
you
it
wo
i
struggle
for
that
till
i
die
i
will
till
i
die
till
i
die
he
rubbed
his
head
now
instead
of
his
knees
and
shaking
all
over
he
got
up
and
began
with
uncertain
steps
to
pace
the
floor
hell
hell
hell
he
said
i
got
to
go
through
that
again
yes
you
have
she
sobbed
till
i
yes
that
what
you
been
after
all
the
time
i
was
getting
yes
i
have
and
i
keep
on
till
i
die
a
fine
wife
for
a
man
he
said
beggin
a
man
to
be
a
dirty
dog
no
to
be
a
man
and
i
keep
on
till
i
die
adams
again
fell
back
upon
his
last
solace
he
walked
half
staggering
up
and
down
the
room
swearing
in
a
rhythmic
repetition
his
wife
had
repetitions
of
her
own
and
she
kept
at
them
in
a
voice
that
rose
to
a
higher
and
higher
pitch
like
the
sound
of
an
old
till
i
die
till
i
die
till
i
die
she
ended
in
a
scream
and
alice
coming
up
the
stairs
thanked
heaven
that
russell
had
gone
she
ran
to
her
father
door
and
went
in
adams
looked
at
her
and
gesticulated
shakily
at
the
convulsive
figure
on
the
floor
can
you
get
her
out
of
here
alice
helped
adams
to
her
feet
and
the
stricken
woman
threw
her
arms
passionately
about
her
daughter
get
her
out
adams
said
harshly
then
cried
wait
alice
moving
toward
the
door
halted
and
looked
at
him
blankly
over
her
mother
shoulder
what
is
it
papa
he
stretched
out
his
arm
and
pointed
at
her
she
says
she
says
you
have
a
mean
life
no
adams
turned
in
her
daughter
arms
do
you
hear
her
lie
you
be
as
brave
as
she
is
virgil
are
you
lying
alice
he
asked
do
you
have
a
mean
time
no
he
came
toward
her
look
at
me
he
said
things
like
this
dance
now
is
that
so
hard
to
bear
alice
tried
to
say
no
papa
again
but
she
could
suddenly
and
in
spite
of
herself
she
began
to
cry
do
you
hear
her
his
wife
sobbed
now
do
you
he
waved
at
them
fiercely
get
out
of
here
he
said
both
of
you
get
out
of
here
as
they
went
he
dropped
in
his
chair
and
bent
far
forward
so
that
his
haggard
face
was
concealed
from
them
then
as
alice
closed
the
door
he
began
to
rub
his
knees
again
muttering
oh
my
my
oh
my
my
chapter
xiv
there
shone
a
jovial
sun
overhead
on
the
appointed
day
after
a
day
not
cool
yet
of
a
temperature
friendly
to
walkers
and
the
air
powdered
with
sunshine
had
so
much
life
in
it
that
it
seemed
to
sparkle
to
arthur
russell
this
was
a
day
like
a
gay
companion
who
pleased
him
well
but
the
gay
companion
at
his
side
pleased
him
even
better
she
looked
her
prettiest
chattered
her
wittiest
smiled
her
wistfulest
and
delighted
him
with
all
together
you
look
so
happy
it
easy
to
see
your
father
taken
a
good
turn
he
told
her
yes
he
has
this
afternoon
at
least
she
said
i
might
have
other
reasons
for
looking
cheerful
for
instance
exactly
she
said
giving
him
a
sweet
look
just
enough
mocked
by
her
laughter
for
instance
well
go
on
he
begged
is
it
expected
she
asked
of
you
you
mean
no
she
returned
for
you
i
mean
in
this
style
which
uses
a
word
for
any
meaning
that
quick
look
and
colourful
gesture
care
to
endow
it
with
she
was
an
expert
and
she
carried
it
merrily
on
leaving
him
at
liberty
one
of
the
great
values
of
the
style
to
choose
as
he
would
how
much
or
how
little
she
meant
he
was
content
to
supply
mere
cues
for
although
he
had
little
coquetry
of
his
own
he
had
lately
begun
to
find
that
the
only
interesting
moments
in
his
life
were
those
during
which
alice
adams
coquetted
with
him
happily
these
obliging
moments
extended
themselves
to
cover
all
the
time
he
spent
with
her
however
serious
she
might
seem
whatever
appeared
to
be
her
topic
all
was
he
planned
for
more
of
it
seeing
otherwise
a
dull
evening
ahead
and
reverted
afterwhile
to
a
forbidden
subject
about
that
dance
at
miss
lamb
since
your
father
so
much
better
she
flushed
a
little
now
now
she
chided
him
we
agreed
not
to
say
any
more
about
yes
but
since
he
is
better
alice
shook
her
head
he
wo
be
better
he
always
has
a
bad
day
after
a
good
one
especially
after
such
a
good
one
as
this
but
if
this
time
it
should
be
different
russell
persisted
you
be
willing
to
come
if
he
better
by
evening
why
not
wait
and
decide
at
the
last
minute
she
waved
her
hands
airily
what
a
pother
she
cried
what
does
it
matter
whether
poor
little
alice
adams
goes
to
a
dance
or
not
well
i
thought
i
made
it
clear
that
it
looks
fairly
bleak
to
me
if
you
do
oh
yes
she
jeered
it
the
simple
truth
he
insisted
i
do
care
a
great
deal
about
dances
these
days
and
if
you
are
going
to
be
there
you
could
stay
away
she
suggested
you
would
unfortunately
i
ca
i
afraid
i
supposed
to
be
the
excuse
miss
lamb
in
her
capacity
as
a
friend
of
my
relatives
oh
she
giving
it
for
you
i
see
on
mildred
account
you
mean
at
that
his
face
showed
an
increase
of
colour
i
suppose
just
on
account
of
my
being
a
cousin
of
mildred
and
of
of
course
you
have
a
beautiful
time
too
henrietta
see
that
you
have
somebody
to
dance
with
besides
miss
dowling
poor
man
but
what
i
want
somebody
to
see
is
that
i
dance
with
you
and
perhaps
your
father
wait
she
said
frowning
as
if
she
debated
whether
or
not
to
tell
him
something
of
import
then
seeming
to
decide
affirmatively
she
asked
would
you
really
like
to
know
the
truth
about
it
if
it
is
too
it
has
anything
to
do
with
you
at
all
she
said
of
course
like
to
go
with
you
and
to
dance
with
you
though
you
do
seem
to
realize
that
you
would
be
permitted
much
time
with
oh
yes
i
never
mind
she
laughed
of
course
you
would
but
even
if
papa
should
be
better
i
doubt
if
i
go
in
fact
i
know
i
would
there
another
reason
besides
is
there
yes
the
truth
is
i
do
get
on
with
henrietta
lamb
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
dislike
her
and
of
course
that
means
she
dislikes
me
i
should
never
think
of
asking
her
to
anything
i
gave
and
i
really
wonder
she
asks
me
to
things
she
this
was
a
new
inspiration
and
alice
beginning
to
see
her
way
out
of
a
perplexity
wished
that
she
had
thought
of
it
earlier
she
should
have
told
him
from
the
first
that
she
and
henrietta
had
a
feud
and
consequently
exchanged
no
invitations
moreover
there
was
another
thing
to
beset
her
with
little
anxieties
she
might
better
not
have
told
him
from
the
first
as
she
had
indeed
told
him
by
intimation
that
she
was
the
pampered
daughter
of
an
indulgent
father
presumably
able
to
indulge
her
for
now
she
must
elaborately
keep
to
the
part
veracity
is
usually
simple
and
its
opposite
to
be
successful
should
be
as
simple
but
practitioners
of
the
opposite
are
most
often
impulsive
like
alice
and
like
her
they
become
enmeshed
in
elaborations
it
would
be
very
nice
for
me
to
go
to
her
house
alice
went
on
when
i
would
want
her
in
mine
i
never
admired
her
i
always
thought
she
was
lacking
in
some
things
most
people
are
supposed
to
be
equipped
with
for
instance
a
certain
feeling
about
the
death
of
a
father
who
was
always
pretty
decent
to
his
daughter
henrietta
father
died
just
eleven
months
and
days
before
your
dance
but
she
could
stick
out
those
few
last
days
and
make
it
a
year
she
was
alice
stopped
then
laughed
ruefully
exclaiming
but
this
is
dreadful
of
me
is
it
blackguarding
her
to
you
when
she
giving
a
big
party
for
you
just
the
way
henrietta
would
blackguard
me
to
you
heaven
knows
what
she
would
say
if
she
talked
about
me
to
you
it
would
be
fair
of
course
but
well
i
rather
she
did
and
with
that
alice
let
her
pretty
hand
in
its
white
glove
rest
upon
his
arm
for
a
moment
and
he
looked
down
at
it
not
unmoved
to
see
it
there
i
want
to
be
unfair
about
just
this
she
said
letting
a
troubled
laughter
tremble
through
her
appealing
voice
as
she
spoke
i
wo
take
advantage
of
her
with
anybody
except
just
you
i
a
little
rather
you
did
hear
anybody
blackguard
me
and
if
you
do
mind
could
you
promise
not
to
give
henrietta
the
chance
it
was
charmingly
done
with
a
humorous
faint
pathos
altogether
genuine
and
russell
found
himself
suddenly
wanting
to
shout
at
her
oh
you
dear
nothing
else
seemed
adequate
but
he
controlled
the
impulse
in
favour
of
something
more
conservative
imagine
any
one
speaking
unkindly
of
you
not
praising
you
who
has
praised
me
to
you
she
asked
quickly
i
have
talked
about
you
with
any
one
but
if
i
did
i
know
they
no
no
she
cried
and
went
on
again
accompanying
her
words
with
little
tremulous
runs
of
laughter
you
do
understand
this
town
yet
you
be
surprised
when
you
do
we
different
we
talk
about
one
another
fearfully
have
i
just
proved
it
the
way
i
been
going
for
henrietta
of
course
i
did
say
anything
really
very
terrible
about
her
but
that
only
because
i
do
follow
that
practice
the
way
most
of
the
others
do
they
do
stop
with
the
worst
of
the
truth
they
can
find
they
make
up
things
yes
they
really
do
and
oh
i
rather
they
did
make
up
things
about
me
to
you
what
difference
would
it
make
if
they
did
he
inquired
cheerfully
i
know
they
were
even
if
you
did
know
that
they
make
a
difference
she
said
oh
yes
they
would
it
too
bad
but
we
do
like
anything
quite
so
well
that
had
specks
on
it
even
if
we
wiped
the
specks
off
it
just
that
much
spoiled
and
some
things
are
all
spoiled
the
instant
the
least
bit
spoiled
what
a
man
thinks
about
a
girl
for
instance
do
you
want
to
have
what
you
think
about
me
spoiled
russell
oh
but
that
already
far
beyond
reach
he
said
lightly
but
it
ca
be
she
protested
why
not
because
it
never
can
be
men
do
change
their
minds
about
one
another
often
they
make
it
quite
an
event
when
they
do
and
talk
about
it
as
if
something
important
had
happened
but
a
girl
only
has
to
go
with
a
unfastened
and
every
man
who
sees
her
will
change
his
mind
about
her
do
you
know
that
true
not
of
myself
i
there
she
cried
that
precisely
what
every
man
in
the
world
would
say
so
you
would
trust
me
well
i
be
awfully
worried
if
you
give
a
chance
to
tell
you
that
i
too
lazy
to
tie
my
he
laughed
delightedly
is
that
what
they
do
say
he
asked
just
about
whatever
they
hope
will
get
she
shook
her
head
wisely
oh
yes
we
do
that
here
but
i
do
mind
loose
he
said
not
if
they
they
find
out
what
you
do
but
suppose
he
said
looking
at
her
whimsically
suppose
i
mind
anything
so
long
as
it
yours
she
courtesied
oh
pretty
enough
but
a
girl
who
talked
about
has
a
weakness
that
often
a
fatal
what
is
it
it
this
when
she
talked
about
she
is
there
that
how
they
kill
i
afraid
i
do
follow
do
you
see
if
henrietta
or
mildred
or
any
of
or
some
of
their
mothers
oh
we
all
do
it
well
if
any
of
told
you
i
tie
my
and
if
i
were
there
so
that
you
could
see
me
you
know
it
was
true
even
if
i
were
sitting
so
that
you
see
my
feet
and
could
tell
whether
the
strings
were
tied
or
not
just
then
still
you
could
look
at
me
and
see
that
i
was
the
sort
of
girl
to
neglect
my
but
that
is
the
way
it
happens
get
at
you
when
i
nowhere
around
and
ca
remind
you
of
the
sort
of
girl
i
really
but
you
do
do
that
he
complained
you
do
remind
me
you
even
tell
me
the
sort
of
girl
you
really
are
i
like
to
let
be
serious
then
she
said
and
looked
serious
enough
herself
would
you
honestly
like
to
know
well
then
you
must
be
the
word
amused
him
i
mean
careful
not
to
get
me
mixed
up
she
said
careful
not
to
mix
up
the
girl
you
might
hear
somebody
talking
about
with
the
me
i
honestly
try
to
make
you
see
if
you
do
get
those
two
mixed
up
well
the
whole
show
be
spoiled
what
makes
you
think
so
because
it
she
checked
herself
having
begun
to
speak
too
impulsively
and
she
was
disturbed
realizing
in
what
tricky
stuff
she
dealt
what
had
been
on
her
lips
to
say
was
because
happened
before
she
changed
to
because
it
so
easy
to
spoil
anything
easiest
of
all
to
spoil
anything
that
that
might
no
it
so
and
if
you
care
at
all
about
about
knowing
a
girl
like
someone
to
know
her
just
that
well
you
she
said
tell
me
how
you
want
me
to
be
then
well
do
you
think
it
would
be
nice
if
you
did
give
anybody
the
chance
to
talk
about
me
the
way
the
way
i
just
been
talking
about
henrietta
lamb
with
that
they
laughed
together
and
he
said
you
may
be
cutting
me
off
from
a
great
deal
of
information
you
yes
alice
admitted
somebody
might
begin
to
praise
me
to
you
too
so
it
dangerous
to
ask
you
to
change
the
subject
if
i
ever
happen
to
be
mentioned
but
after
all
she
paused
all
is
the
end
of
a
thought
is
it
sometimes
it
is
of
a
girl
thought
i
suppose
men
are
neater
about
their
thoughts
and
always
finish
it
is
the
end
of
the
thought
i
had
then
what
is
the
end
of
it
she
looked
at
him
impulsively
oh
it
foolish
she
said
and
she
laughed
as
laughs
one
who
proposes
something
probably
impossible
but
would
it
be
pleasant
if
two
people
could
ever
just
keep
themselves
to
themselves
so
far
as
they
two
were
concerned
i
mean
if
they
could
just
manage
to
be
friends
without
people
talking
about
it
or
talking
to
them
about
it
i
suppose
that
might
be
rather
difficult
he
said
more
amused
than
impressed
by
her
idea
i
do
know
it
might
be
done
she
returned
hopefully
especially
in
a
town
of
this
size
it
grown
so
it
quite
a
huge
place
these
days
people
can
keep
themselves
to
themselves
in
a
big
place
better
you
know
for
instance
nobody
knows
that
you
and
i
are
taking
a
walk
together
how
absurd
when
here
we
are
on
exhibition
no
we
we
are
not
a
bit
of
it
she
laughed
we
were
the
other
day
when
you
walked
home
with
me
but
anybody
could
tell
that
had
just
happened
by
chance
on
account
of
your
overtaking
me
people
can
always
see
things
like
that
but
we
not
on
exhibition
now
look
where
i
led
you
amused
and
a
little
bewildered
he
looked
up
and
down
the
street
which
was
one
of
old
sooty
frame
small
groceries
and
laundries
and
plumbers
shops
with
the
sign
of
a
clairvoyant
here
and
there
you
see
she
said
i
been
leading
you
without
your
knowing
it
of
course
that
because
you
new
to
the
town
and
you
give
yourself
up
to
the
guidance
of
an
old
i
not
so
sure
miss
adams
it
might
mean
that
i
do
care
where
i
follow
so
long
as
i
follow
very
well
she
said
i
like
you
to
keep
on
following
me
at
least
long
enough
for
me
to
show
you
that
there
something
nicer
ahead
of
us
than
this
dingy
is
that
figurative
he
asked
might
be
she
returned
gaily
there
a
pretty
little
park
at
the
end
but
it
very
proletarian
and
nobody
you
and
i
know
will
be
more
likely
to
see
us
there
than
on
this
what
an
imagination
you
have
he
exclaimed
you
turn
our
proper
little
walk
into
a
parisian
she
looked
at
him
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
momentary
grave
puzzlement
perhaps
you
feel
that
a
parisian
adventure
might
please
your
your
relatives
why
no
he
returned
you
seem
to
think
of
them
oftener
than
i
this
appeared
to
amuse
alice
or
at
least
to
please
her
for
she
laughed
then
i
can
afford
to
quit
thinking
of
them
i
suppose
only
that
i
used
to
be
quite
a
friend
of
mildred
but
there
we
need
to
go
into
that
i
never
been
a
friend
of
henrietta
lamb
though
and
i
almost
wish
she
were
taking
such
pains
to
be
a
friend
of
oh
but
she
not
it
all
on
account
of
on
mildred
account
alice
finished
this
for
him
coolly
yes
of
it
on
account
of
the
two
families
he
was
at
pains
to
explain
a
little
awkwardly
it
because
i
a
relative
of
the
palmers
and
the
palmers
and
the
lambs
seem
to
be
old
family
something
the
adamses
certainly
are
not
alice
said
not
with
either
of
particularly
not
with
the
lambs
and
here
scarce
aware
of
what
impelled
her
she
returned
to
her
former
elaborations
and
colourings
you
see
the
differences
between
henrietta
and
me
are
entirely
personal
i
could
go
to
her
house
even
if
i
liked
her
the
lambs
and
adamses
do
get
on
with
each
other
and
we
just
about
come
to
the
as
it
i
hope
it
nothing
to
bother
why
a
lot
of
things
bother
i
sorry
they
do
he
said
and
seemed
simply
to
mean
it
she
nodded
gratefully
that
nice
of
you
russell
it
helps
the
break
between
the
adamses
and
the
lambs
is
a
pretty
bothersome
thing
it
been
coming
on
a
long
she
sighed
deeply
and
the
sigh
was
half
genuine
this
half
being
for
her
father
but
the
other
half
probably
belonged
to
her
instinctive
rendering
of
juliet
capulet
daughter
to
a
warring
house
i
hate
it
all
so
she
added
of
course
you
i
suppose
most
quarrels
between
families
are
on
account
of
business
she
said
that
why
they
so
sordid
certainly
the
lambs
seem
a
sordid
lot
to
me
though
of
course
i
and
with
that
she
began
to
sketch
a
history
of
the
commercial
antagonism
that
had
risen
between
the
adamses
and
the
lambs
the
sketching
was
spontaneous
and
dramatic
mathematics
had
no
part
in
it
nor
was
there
accurate
definition
of
adams
relation
to
the
institution
of
lamb
and
company
the
point
was
clouded
in
fact
though
that
might
easily
be
set
down
to
the
general
haziness
of
young
ladies
confronted
with
the
mysteries
of
trade
or
commerce
adams
either
had
been
a
vague
sort
of
junior
member
of
the
firm
it
appeared
or
else
he
should
have
been
made
some
such
thing
at
all
events
he
was
an
old
mainstay
of
the
business
and
he
as
much
as
any
lamb
had
helped
to
build
up
the
prosperity
of
the
company
but
at
last
tired
of
providing
so
much
intelligence
and
energy
for
which
other
people
took
profit
greater
than
his
own
he
had
decided
to
leave
the
company
and
found
a
business
entirely
for
himself
the
lambs
were
going
to
be
enraged
when
they
learned
what
was
afoot
such
was
the
impression
a
little
misted
wrought
by
alice
quick
narrative
but
there
was
dolorous
fact
behind
it
adams
had
succumbed
his
wife
grave
and
nervous
rather
than
triumphant
in
success
had
told
their
daughter
that
the
great
j
would
be
furious
and
possibly
vindictive
adams
was
afraid
of
him
she
said
but
what
for
mama
alice
asked
since
this
seemed
a
turn
of
affairs
out
of
reason
what
in
the
world
has
lamb
to
do
with
papa
leaving
the
company
to
set
up
for
himself
what
right
has
he
to
be
angry
about
it
if
he
such
a
friend
as
he
claims
to
be
i
should
think
he
be
glad
that
is
if
the
glue
factory
turns
out
well
what
will
he
be
angry
for
adams
gave
alice
an
uneasy
glance
hesitated
and
then
explained
that
a
resignation
from
lamb
had
always
been
looked
upon
especially
by
that
old
man
as
treachery
you
were
supposed
to
die
in
the
service
she
said
bitterly
and
her
daughter
a
little
mystified
accepted
this
explanation
adams
had
not
spoken
to
her
of
his
surrender
he
seemed
not
inclined
to
speak
to
her
at
all
or
to
any
one
alice
was
not
serious
too
long
and
she
began
to
laugh
as
she
came
to
the
end
of
her
decorative
sketch
after
all
the
whole
thing
is
perfectly
ridiculous
she
said
in
fact
it
funny
that
on
account
of
what
papa
going
to
throw
over
the
lamb
business
for
to
save
your
life
you
could
imagine
what
he
going
to
do
i
wo
try
then
russell
assented
it
takes
all
the
romance
out
of
me
she
laughed
you
never
go
for
a
parisian
walk
with
me
again
after
i
tell
you
what
i
be
heiress
they
had
come
to
the
entrance
of
the
little
park
and
as
alice
had
said
it
was
a
pretty
place
especially
on
a
day
so
radiant
trees
of
the
oldest
forest
stood
there
hale
and
serene
over
the
trim
bright
grass
and
the
proletarians
had
not
come
from
their
factories
at
this
hour
only
a
few
mothers
and
their
babies
were
to
be
seen
here
and
there
in
the
shade
i
think
i
postpone
telling
you
about
it
till
we
get
nearly
home
again
alice
said
as
they
began
to
saunter
down
one
of
the
gravelled
paths
there
a
bench
beside
a
spring
farther
on
we
can
sit
there
and
talk
about
a
lot
of
things
things
not
so
sticky
as
my
dowry
going
to
he
echoed
what
in
the
world
she
laughed
despairingly
a
glue
factory
then
he
laughed
too
as
much
from
friendliness
as
from
amusement
and
she
remembered
to
tell
him
that
the
project
of
a
glue
factory
was
still
an
adams
it
would
be
known
soon
however
she
added
and
the
whole
lamb
connection
would
probably
begin
saying
all
sorts
of
things
heaven
knew
what
thus
alice
built
her
walls
of
flimsy
working
always
gaily
or
with
at
least
the
air
of
gaiety
and
even
as
she
rattled
on
there
was
somewhere
in
her
mind
a
constant
little
wonder
everything
she
said
seemed
to
be
necessary
to
support
something
else
she
had
said
how
had
it
happened
she
found
herself
telling
him
that
since
her
father
had
decided
on
making
so
great
a
change
in
his
ways
she
and
her
mother
hoped
at
last
to
persuade
him
to
give
up
that
foolish
little
house
he
had
been
so
obstinate
about
and
she
checked
herself
abruptly
on
this
declivity
just
as
she
was
about
to
slide
into
a
remark
concerning
her
own
preference
for
a
country
discretion
caught
her
in
time
and
something
else
in
company
with
discretion
caught
her
for
she
stopped
short
in
her
talk
and
blushed
they
had
taken
possession
of
the
bench
beside
the
spring
by
this
time
and
russell
his
elbow
on
the
back
of
the
bench
and
his
chin
on
his
hand
the
better
to
look
at
her
had
no
guess
at
the
cause
of
the
blush
but
was
content
to
find
it
lovely
at
his
first
sight
of
alice
she
had
seemed
pretty
in
the
particular
way
of
being
pretty
that
he
happened
to
like
best
and
with
every
moment
he
spent
with
her
this
prettiness
appeared
to
increase
he
felt
that
he
could
not
look
at
her
enough
his
gaze
followed
the
fluttering
of
the
graceful
hands
in
almost
continual
gesture
as
she
talked
then
lifted
happily
to
the
vivacious
face
again
she
charmed
him
after
her
abrupt
pause
she
sighed
then
looked
at
him
with
her
eyebrows
lifted
in
a
comedy
appeal
you
have
said
you
would
give
henrietta
the
chance
she
said
in
the
softest
voice
that
can
still
have
a
little
laugh
running
in
it
he
was
puzzled
give
henrietta
the
chance
you
know
you
let
me
keep
on
being
unfair
wo
you
not
give
the
other
girls
a
chance
to
get
even
he
promised
heartily
chapter
xv
alice
had
said
that
no
one
who
knew
either
russell
or
herself
would
be
likely
to
see
them
in
the
park
or
upon
the
dingy
street
but
although
they
returned
by
that
same
ungenteel
thoroughfare
they
were
seen
by
a
person
who
knew
them
both
also
with
some
surprise
on
the
part
of
russell
and
something
more
poignant
than
surprise
for
alice
they
saw
this
person
all
of
the
dingy
street
was
ugly
but
the
greater
part
of
it
appeared
to
be
honest
the
two
pedestrians
came
upon
a
block
or
two
however
where
it
offered
suggestions
of
a
less
upright
character
like
a
steady
enough
workingman
with
a
naughty
book
sticking
out
of
his
pocket
three
or
four
dim
shops
a
single
story
in
height
exhibited
foul
signboards
yet
fair
enough
so
far
as
the
wording
went
one
proclaiming
a
tobacconist
one
a
one
a
dispenser
of
soft
drinks
and
the
most
credulous
would
have
doubted
these
signboards
for
the
craft
of
the
modern
tradesman
is
exerted
to
lure
indoors
the
passing
glance
since
if
the
glance
is
pleased
the
feet
may
follow
but
this
alleged
tobacconist
and
his
neighbours
had
long
been
fond
of
dust
on
their
windows
evidently
and
shades
were
pulled
far
down
on
the
glass
of
their
doors
thus
the
public
eye
small
of
pupil
in
the
light
of
the
open
street
was
intentionally
not
invited
to
the
dusky
interiors
something
different
from
mere
lack
of
enterprise
was
apparent
and
the
signboards
might
have
been
omitted
they
were
pains
thrown
away
since
it
was
plain
to
the
world
that
the
business
parts
of
these
shops
were
the
brighter
back
rooms
implied
by
the
dark
front
rooms
and
that
the
commerce
there
was
in
perilous
new
liquors
and
in
dice
and
rough
girls
nothing
could
have
been
more
innocent
than
the
serenity
with
which
these
wicked
little
places
revealed
themselves
for
what
they
were
and
bound
by
this
final
tie
of
guilelessness
they
stood
together
in
a
row
which
ended
with
a
companionable
barbershop
much
like
them
beyond
was
a
series
of
frame
houses
once
part
of
a
cheerful
neighbourhood
when
the
town
was
and
settled
and
not
old
and
growing
these
houses
all
carrying
the
label
rooms
had
the
worried
look
of
vacancy
that
houses
have
when
they
are
too
full
of
everybody
without
being
anybody
home
and
there
was
too
a
surreptitious
air
about
them
as
if
like
the
false
little
shops
they
advertised
something
by
concealing
it
one
of
them
the
one
next
to
the
had
across
its
front
an
ample
veranda
where
aforetime
no
doubt
the
father
of
a
family
had
fanned
himself
with
a
fan
on
sunday
afternoons
watching
the
surreys
go
by
and
where
his
daughter
listened
to
mandolins
and
badinage
on
starlit
evenings
but
although
youth
still
held
the
veranda
both
the
youth
and
the
veranda
were
in
decay
the
four
or
five
young
men
who
lounged
there
this
afternoon
were
of
a
type
known
to
shady
hats
found
no
favour
with
them
all
of
them
wore
caps
and
their
tight
clothes
apparently
from
a
common
source
showed
a
vivacious
fancy
for
oblique
pockets
false
belts
and
colourings
another
thing
common
to
the
group
was
the
expression
of
eye
and
mouth
and
alice
in
the
midst
of
her
other
thoughts
had
a
distasteful
thought
about
this
the
veranda
was
within
a
dozen
feet
of
the
sidewalk
and
as
she
and
her
escort
came
nearer
she
took
note
of
the
young
men
her
face
hardening
a
little
even
before
she
suspected
there
might
be
a
resemblance
between
them
and
any
one
she
knew
then
she
observed
that
each
of
these
loungers
wore
not
for
the
occasion
but
as
of
habit
a
look
of
furtively
amused
contempt
the
mouth
smiled
to
one
side
as
if
not
to
dislodge
a
cigarette
while
the
eyes
kept
languidly
superior
all
at
once
alice
was
reminded
of
walter
and
the
slight
frown
caused
by
this
idea
had
just
begun
to
darken
her
forehead
when
walter
himself
stepped
out
of
the
open
door
of
the
house
and
appeared
upon
the
veranda
upon
his
head
was
a
new
straw
hat
and
in
his
hand
was
a
malacca
stick
with
an
ivory
top
for
alice
had
finally
decided
against
it
for
herself
and
had
given
it
to
him
his
mood
was
lively
he
twirled
the
stick
through
his
fingers
like
a
baton
and
whistled
loudly
moreover
he
was
indeed
accompanied
with
him
was
a
thin
girl
who
had
made
a
violent
poster
of
herself
black
dress
black
flimsy
boa
black
stockings
white
slippers
great
black
hat
down
upon
the
black
eyes
and
beneath
the
hat
a
curve
of
cheek
and
chin
made
white
as
whitewash
and
in
strong
bilateral
motion
with
gum
the
loungers
on
the
veranda
were
familiars
of
the
pair
hailed
them
with
cacklings
and
one
began
to
sing
in
a
voice
all
tin
then
my
skirt
sal
and
me
did
go
right
straight
to
the
show
oh
you
bashful
vamp
the
girl
laughed
airily
god
but
you
guys
are
wise
she
said
come
on
walter
stared
at
his
sister
then
grinned
faintly
and
nodded
at
russell
as
the
latter
lifted
his
hat
in
salutation
alice
uttered
an
incoherent
syllable
of
exclamation
and
as
she
began
to
walk
faster
she
bit
her
lip
hard
not
in
order
to
look
wistful
this
time
but
to
help
her
keep
tears
of
anger
from
her
eyes
russell
laughed
cheerfully
your
brother
certainly
seems
to
have
found
the
place
for
today
he
said
that
girl
talk
must
be
full
of
but
alice
had
forgotten
the
colour
she
herself
had
used
in
accounting
for
walter
peculiarities
and
she
did
not
understand
what
she
said
huskily
do
you
remember
telling
me
about
him
how
he
was
going
to
write
probably
and
would
go
anywhere
to
pick
up
types
and
get
them
to
talk
she
kept
her
eyes
ahead
and
said
sharply
i
think
his
literary
tastes
scarcely
cover
this
case
do
be
too
sure
he
did
look
at
all
disconcerted
he
did
seem
to
mind
your
seeing
that
all
the
worse
is
it
why
no
her
friend
said
genially
it
means
he
did
consider
that
he
was
engaged
in
anything
out
of
the
way
you
ca
expect
to
understand
everything
boys
do
at
his
age
they
do
all
sorts
of
queer
things
and
outgrow
them
your
brother
evidently
has
a
taste
for
queer
people
and
very
likely
he
been
at
least
half
sincere
when
he
made
you
believe
he
had
a
literary
motive
behind
it
we
all
go
through
thanks
russell
she
interrupted
let
do
say
any
he
looked
at
her
flushed
face
and
enlarged
eyes
and
he
liked
her
all
the
better
for
her
indignation
this
was
how
good
sisters
ought
to
feel
he
thought
failing
to
understand
that
most
of
what
she
felt
was
not
about
walter
he
ventured
only
a
word
more
try
not
to
mind
it
so
much
it
really
does
amount
to
she
shook
her
head
and
they
went
on
in
silence
she
did
not
look
at
him
again
until
they
stopped
before
her
own
house
then
she
gave
him
only
one
glimpse
of
her
eyes
before
she
looked
down
it
spoiled
it
she
said
in
a
low
voice
what
our
walk
well
everything
somehow
it
always
is
what
he
asked
spoiled
she
said
he
laughed
at
that
but
without
looking
at
him
she
suddenly
offered
him
her
hand
and
as
he
took
it
he
felt
a
hurried
violent
pressure
upon
his
fingers
as
if
she
meant
to
thank
him
almost
passionately
for
being
kind
she
was
gone
before
he
could
speak
to
her
again
in
her
room
with
the
door
locked
she
did
not
go
to
her
mirror
but
to
her
bed
flinging
herself
face
down
not
caring
how
far
the
pillows
put
her
hat
awry
sheer
grief
had
followed
her
anger
grief
for
the
calamitous
end
of
her
bright
afternoon
grief
for
the
end
of
everything
as
she
thought
then
nevertheless
she
gradually
grew
more
composed
and
when
her
mother
tapped
on
the
door
presently
let
her
in
adams
looked
at
her
with
quick
apprehension
oh
poor
child
was
he
alice
told
her
you
see
how
it
how
it
made
me
look
mama
she
quavered
having
concluded
her
narrative
i
tried
to
cover
up
walter
awfulness
at
the
dance
with
that
story
about
his
being
but
no
story
was
big
enough
to
cover
this
up
and
oh
it
must
make
him
think
i
tell
stories
about
other
things
no
no
no
adams
protested
do
you
see
at
the
worst
all
he
could
think
is
that
walter
told
stories
to
you
about
why
he
likes
to
be
with
such
dreadful
people
and
you
believed
them
that
all
he
think
do
you
see
alice
wet
eyes
began
to
show
a
little
hopefulness
you
honestly
think
it
might
be
that
way
mama
why
from
what
you
told
me
he
said
i
know
it
that
way
did
he
say
he
wanted
to
come
again
alice
said
uncertainly
but
i
think
he
will
at
least
i
begin
to
think
so
now
he
she
stopped
from
all
you
tell
me
he
seems
to
be
a
very
desirable
young
man
adams
said
primly
her
daughter
was
silent
for
several
moments
then
new
tears
gathered
upon
her
downcast
lashes
he
just
dear
she
faltered
adams
nodded
he
told
you
he
is
engaged
has
he
no
but
i
know
he
is
maybe
when
he
first
came
here
he
was
near
it
but
i
know
he
i
guess
mildred
palmer
would
like
him
to
be
all
right
adams
was
frank
enough
to
say
rather
triumphantly
and
alice
with
a
lowered
head
murmured
anybody
the
words
were
all
but
inaudible
do
you
worry
her
mother
said
and
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
everything
will
come
out
all
right
do
you
fear
alice
ca
you
see
that
beside
any
other
girl
in
town
you
just
a
perfect
queen
do
you
think
any
young
man
that
was
prejudiced
or
something
would
need
more
than
just
one
look
to
but
alice
moved
away
from
the
caressing
hand
never
mind
mama
i
wonder
he
looks
at
me
at
all
and
if
he
does
again
after
seeing
my
brother
with
those
horrible
people
now
now
adams
interrupted
expostulating
mournfully
i
sure
walter
a
good
boy
you
are
alice
cried
with
a
sudden
vigour
you
are
i
sure
he
good
yes
and
if
he
is
it
not
his
fault
what
nonsense
no
it
true
adams
lamented
i
tried
to
bring
him
up
to
be
good
god
knows
and
when
he
was
little
he
was
the
best
boy
i
ever
saw
when
he
came
from
he
always
run
to
me
and
we
go
over
the
lesson
together
and
he
let
me
come
in
his
room
at
night
to
hear
his
prayers
almost
until
he
was
sixteen
most
boys
wo
do
that
with
their
mothers
not
nearly
that
long
i
tried
so
hard
to
bring
him
up
right
but
if
anything
gone
wrong
it
my
how
could
it
be
you
just
said
it
because
i
did
make
your
father
this
this
new
step
earlier
then
walter
might
have
had
all
the
advantages
that
other
oh
mama
please
alice
begged
her
let
do
go
over
all
that
again
is
it
more
important
to
think
what
to
be
done
about
him
is
he
going
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
disgracing
us
as
he
does
adams
sighed
profoundly
i
do
know
what
to
do
she
confessed
unhappily
your
father
so
upset
about
about
this
new
step
taking
i
do
feel
as
if
we
ought
to
no
no
alice
cried
papa
must
be
distressed
with
this
on
top
of
everything
else
but
something
got
to
be
done
about
what
can
be
her
mother
asked
helplessly
what
can
be
alice
admitted
that
she
did
know
at
dinner
an
hour
later
walter
habitually
veiled
glance
lifted
now
and
then
to
touch
her
furtively
he
was
waiting
as
he
would
have
said
for
her
to
spring
it
and
he
had
prepared
a
brief
and
sincere
defense
to
the
effect
that
he
made
his
own
living
and
would
like
to
inquire
whose
business
it
was
to
offer
intrusive
comment
upon
his
private
conduct
but
she
said
nothing
while
his
father
and
mother
were
as
silent
as
she
walter
concluded
that
there
was
to
be
no
attack
but
changed
his
mind
when
his
father
who
ate
only
a
little
and
broodingly
at
that
rose
to
leave
the
table
and
spoke
to
him
walter
he
said
when
you
finished
i
wish
you
come
up
to
my
room
i
got
something
i
want
to
say
to
walter
shot
a
hard
look
at
his
apathetic
sister
then
turned
to
his
father
make
it
he
said
this
is
night
and
i
got
a
no
adams
said
frowning
you
come
up
before
you
go
out
all
right
i
had
all
i
want
to
eat
walter
returned
i
got
a
few
minutes
make
it
he
followed
his
father
upstairs
and
when
they
were
in
the
room
together
adams
shut
the
door
sat
down
and
began
to
rub
his
knees
rheumatism
the
boy
inquired
slyly
that
what
you
want
to
talk
to
me
about
but
adams
did
not
go
on
he
seemed
to
be
in
difficulties
for
words
and
walter
decided
to
help
him
hop
ahead
and
spring
it
he
said
get
it
off
your
mind
i
tell
the
world
should
worry
you
are
goin
to
bother
me
any
so
why
bother
yourself
alice
hopped
home
and
told
you
she
saw
me
playin
around
with
some
pretty
berries
and
you
alice
his
father
said
obviously
surprised
it
nothing
about
did
she
tell
you
i
have
talked
with
her
all
oh
i
see
walter
said
she
told
mother
and
mother
told
no
neither
of
have
told
me
anything
what
was
there
to
tell
walter
laughed
oh
it
nothin
he
said
i
was
just
startin
out
to
buy
a
girl
friend
o
mine
a
rhinestone
buckle
i
lost
to
her
on
a
bet
this
afternoon
and
alice
came
along
with
that
big
russell
fish
and
i
thought
she
looked
sore
she
expects
me
to
like
the
kind
she
likes
and
i
do
like
i
thought
she
got
you
all
stirred
up
about
no
no
his
father
said
peevishly
i
do
know
anything
about
it
and
i
do
care
to
know
anything
about
it
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
something
then
as
he
was
again
silent
walter
said
well
talk
about
it
it
this
adams
began
heavily
it
about
me
going
into
this
glue
business
your
mother
told
you
has
she
she
said
you
were
goin
to
leave
the
old
place
and
start
a
glue
factory
that
all
i
know
about
it
i
got
my
own
affairs
to
well
this
is
your
affair
his
father
said
frowning
you
ca
stay
with
lamb
and
walter
looked
a
little
startled
what
you
mean
i
ca
why
not
you
got
to
help
me
adams
explained
slowly
and
he
frowned
more
deeply
as
if
the
interview
were
growing
increasingly
laborious
for
him
it
going
to
be
a
big
pull
to
get
this
business
on
its
yes
walter
exclaimed
with
a
sharp
skepticism
i
should
say
it
was
he
stared
at
his
father
incredulously
look
here
are
you
just
a
little
bit
sudden
the
way
you
goin
about
things
you
let
mother
shove
you
a
little
too
fast
have
you
do
you
know
anything
about
what
it
means
to
set
up
a
new
business
these
days
yes
i
know
all
about
it
adams
said
about
this
business
i
how
do
you
because
i
made
a
long
study
of
it
i
not
afraid
of
going
about
it
the
wrong
way
but
it
a
hard
job
and
you
have
to
put
in
all
whatever
sense
and
strength
you
walter
began
to
breathe
quickly
and
his
lips
were
agitated
then
he
set
them
obstinately
oh
i
will
he
said
yes
you
will
adams
returned
not
noticing
that
his
son
inflection
was
satiric
it
going
to
take
every
bit
of
energy
in
your
body
and
all
the
energy
i
got
left
in
mine
and
every
cent
of
the
little
saved
besides
something
i
have
to
raise
on
this
house

going
right
at
it
now
i

to
and
you

to
quit
lamb
by
the
end
of

walter
voice
grew
louder
and
there
was
a
shrillness
in
it
i
got
to
quit
lamb

end
of
next
week

i
he
stepped
forward
angrily

said

told
him
sharply

the
utmost
vehemence
do
tell
me
what
i
got
to
do
i
know
what
i
got
to
do
you
i
guess

adams
rose
angrily
you
do
what
i
tell
you

down
why
ca
i
because
i
wo
let
listen
keep
on
not

his
father
broke
into
a
sour
laughter
they
wo

wo
have
you
down
there
after
they
find
out

his
father
insisted
loudly
why

they
care
enough
to
fire
you
my
boy
look
here
then

walter
jeered
you
keep
sayin
they
will
but
when
i
ask
you
to
show
me
why
you
keep
sayin
they
will
that
makes
little
headway
with
me
i
can
tell
you
adams
groaned
and
rubbing
his
head
began
to
pace
the
floor
refusal
was
something
he
had
not
anticipated
and
he
felt
the
weakness
of
his
own
attempt
to
meet
it
he
seemed
powerless
to
do
anything
but
utter
angry
words
which
as
walter
said
made
little
headway
oh
my
my
he
muttered
oh
my
my
walter
usually
sallow
had
grown
pale
he
watched
his
father
narrowly
and
now
took
a
sudden
resolution
look
here
he
said
when
you
say
lamb
is
likely
to
fire
me
because
you
goin
to
quit
you
talk
like
the
people
that
have
to
be
locked
up
i
do
know
where
you
get
such
things
in
your
head
lamb
and
company
wo
know
you
gone
listen
i
can
stay
there
long
as
i
want
to
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
make
it
worth
my
while
and
i
hook
up
with
your
old
glue
factory
after
adams
stopped
his
pacing
abruptly
and
stared
at
him
it
worth
your
while
what
you
mean
i
got
a
good
use
for
three
hundred
dollars
right
now
walter
said
let
me
have
it
and
i
quit
lamb
to
work
for
you
do
let
me
have
it
and
i
swear
i
wo
are
you
crazy
is
everybody
crazy
that
needs
three
hundred
dollars
yes
adams
said
they
are
if
they
ask
me
for
it
when
i
got
to
stretch
every
cent
i
can
lay
my
hands
on
to
make
it
look
like
a
dollar
you
wo
do
it
adams
burst
out
at
him
you
little
fool
if
i
had
three
hundred
dollars
to
throw
away
besides
the
pay
i
expected
to
give
you
have
you
got
sense
enough
to
see
i
could
hire
a
man
worth
three
hundred
dollars
more
to
me
than
you
be
it
a
fine
time
to
ask
me
for
three
hundred
dollars
is
it
what
for
rhinestone
buckles
to
throw
around
on
your
friends
shame
on
you
ask
me
to
bribe
you
to
help
yourself
and
your
own
family
i
give
you
a
last
chance
walter
said
either
you
do
what
i
want
or
i
wo
do
what
you
want
do
ask
me
again
after
this
because
adams
interrupted
him
fiercely
you
again
do
worry
about
that
my
boy
all
i
ask
you
is
to
get
out
o
my
look
here
walter
said
quietly
and
his
lopsided
smile
distorted
his
livid
cheek
look
here
i
expect
you
would
give
me
three
hundred
dollars
to
save
my
life
would
you
you
make
me
sick
adams
said
in
his
bitterness
get
out
of
walter
went
out
whistling
and
adams
drooped
into
his
old
chair
again
as
the
door
closed
oh
my
my
he
groaned
oh
lordy
lordy
the
way
of
the
transgressor
chapter
xvi
he
meant
his
own
transgression
and
his
own
way
for
walter
stubborn
refusal
appeared
to
adams
just
then
as
one
of
the
inexplicable
but
righteous
besettings
he
must
encounter
in
following
that
way
oh
lordy
lord
he
groaned
and
then
as
resentment
moved
him
that
dang
boy
dang
idiot
yet
he
knew
himself
for
a
greater
idiot
because
he
had
not
been
able
to
tell
walter
the
truth
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
it
nor
even
to
state
his
case
in
its
best
terms
and
that
was
because
he
felt
that
even
in
its
best
terms
the
case
was
a
bad
one
of
all
his
regrets
the
greatest
was
that
in
a
moment
of
vanity
and
tenderness
years
ago
he
had
told
his
young
wife
a
business
secret
he
had
wanted
to
show
how
important
her
husband
was
becoming
and
how
much
the
head
of
the
universe
j
lamb
trusted
to
his
integrity
and
ability
the
great
man
had
an
idea
he
thought
of
branching
out
a
little
he
told
adams
confidentially
and
there
were
possibilities
of
profit
in
glue
what
he
wanted
was
a
liquid
glue
to
be
put
into
little
bottles
and
sold
cheaply
the
kind
of
thing
that
sells
itself
he
said
the
kind
of
thing
that
pays
its
own
small
way
as
it
goes
along
until
it
has
profits
enough
to
begin
advertising
it
right
everybody
has
to
use
glue
and
if
i
make
mine
convenient
and
cheap
everybody
buy
mine
but
it
got
to
be
glue
that
stick
it
got
to
be
the
best
and
if
we
find
how
to
make
it
we
got
to
keep
it
a
big
secret
of
course
or
anybody
can
steal
it
from
us
there
was
a
man
here
last
month
he
knew
a
formula
he
wanted
to
sell
me
unseen
but
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
i
got
suspicious
and
i
found
he
managed
to
steal
it
working
for
the
big
packers
in
their
we
got
to
find
a
better
glue
than
that
anyhow
i
going
to
set
you
and
campbell
at
it
you
a
practical
young
feller
and
campbell
a
mighty
good
chemist
i
guess
you
two
boys
ought
to
make
something
his
guess
was
shrewd
enough
working
in
a
shed
a
little
way
outside
the
town
where
their
cheery
employer
visited
them
sometimes
to
study
their
malodorous
stews
the
two
young
men
found
what
lamb
had
set
them
to
find
but
campbell
was
thoughtful
over
the
discovery
look
here
he
said
why
ai
this
just
about
yours
and
mine
after
all
it
may
be
lamb
money
that
paid
for
the
stuff
we
used
but
it
has
cost
but
he
pays
us
adams
remonstrated
horrified
by
his
companion
idea
he
paid
us
to
do
it
it
belongs
absolutely
to
oh
i
know
he
thinks
it
does
campbell
admitted
plaintively
i
suppose
we
got
to
let
him
take
it
it
not
patentable
and
have
to
do
pretty
well
by
us
when
he
starts
his
factory
because
got
to
depend
on
us
to
run
the
making
of
the
stuff
so
that
the
workmen
ca
get
onto
the
process
you
better
ask
him
the
same
salary
i
do
and
mine
going
to
be
but
the
high
salary
thus
pleasantly
imagined
was
never
paid
campbell
died
of
typhoid
fever
that
summer
leaving
adams
and
his
employer
the
only
possessors
of
the
formula
an
unwritten
one
and
adams
pleased
to
think
himself
more
important
to
the
great
man
than
ever
told
his
wife
that
there
could
be
little
doubt
of
his
being
put
in
sole
charge
of
the
prospective
unfortunately
the
enterprise
remained
prospective
its
projector
had
already
become
inveigled
into
another
as
he
told
adams
one
of
his
sons
had
persuaded
him
to
take
up
a
to
be
called
the
jalamb
balm
trochee
and
the
lozenge
did
well
enough
to
amuse
lamb
and
occupy
his
spare
time
which
was
really
about
all
he
had
asked
of
the
glue
project
he
had
all
the
money
anybody
ought
to
want
he
said
when
adams
urged
him
and
he
could
start
up
this
little
glue
at
any
time
the
formula
was
safe
in
their
two
heads
at
intervals
adams
would
seek
opportunity
to
speak
of
the
little
glue
to
his
patron
and
to
suggest
that
the
years
were
passing
but
lamb
petting
other
hobbies
had
lost
interest
oh
i
start
it
up
some
day
maybe
if
i
do
i
may
turn
it
over
to
my
heirs
always
an
asset
worth
something
or
other
of
course
we
probably
take
it
up
some
day
though
you
and
the
sun
persistently
declined
to
rise
on
that
day
and
as
time
went
on
adams
saw
that
his
rather
timid
urgings
bored
his
employer
and
he
ceased
to
bring
up
the
subject
lamb
apparently
forgot
all
about
glue
but
adams
discovered
that
unfortunately
there
was
someone
else
who
remembered
it
it
really
yours
she
argued
that
painful
day
when
for
the
first
time
she
suggested
his
using
his
knowledge
for
the
benefit
of
himself
and
his
family
mr
campbell
might
have
had
a
right
to
part
of
it
but
he
died
and
did
leave
any
kin
so
it
belongs
to
suppose
j
lamb
hired
me
to
saw
some
wood
adams
said
would
the
sticks
belong
to
me
he
has
got
any
right
to
take
your
invention
and
bury
it
she
protested
what
good
is
it
doing
him
if
he
does
do
anything
with
it
what
good
is
it
doing
anybody
none
in
the
world
and
what
harm
would
it
do
him
if
you
went
ahead
and
did
this
for
yourself
and
for
your
children
none
in
the
world
and
what
could
he
do
to
you
if
he
was
old
pig
enough
to
get
angry
with
you
for
doing
it
he
could
do
a
single
thing
and
you
admitted
he
could
yourself
so
what
your
reason
for
depriving
your
children
and
your
wife
of
the
benefits
you
know
you
could
give
nothing
but
decency
he
answered
and
she
had
her
reply
ready
for
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
strive
as
he
would
he
could
not
reach
her
mind
with
even
the
plainest
language
while
everything
that
she
said
to
him
with
such
vehemence
sounded
like
so
much
obstinate
gibberish
over
and
over
he
pressed
her
with
the
same
illustration
on
the
point
of
ownership
though
he
thought
he
was
varying
it
suppose
he
hired
me
to
build
him
a
house
would
that
be
my
house
he
did
hire
you
to
build
him
a
house
you
and
campbell
invented
look
here
suppose
you
give
a
cook
a
and
some
vegetables
and
pay
her
to
make
you
a
soup
has
she
got
a
right
to
take
and
sell
it
you
know
better
i
know
one
thing
if
that
old
man
tried
to
keep
your
own
invention
from
you
he
no
better
than
a
robber
they
never
found
any
point
of
contact
in
all
their
passionate
discussions
of
this
ethical
question
and
the
question
was
no
more
settled
between
them
now
that
adams
had
succumbed
than
it
had
ever
been
but
at
least
the
wrangling
about
it
was
over
they
were
grave
together
almost
silent
and
an
uneasiness
prevailed
with
her
as
much
as
with
him
he
had
already
been
out
of
the
house
to
walk
about
the
small
green
yard
and
on
monday
afternoon
he
sent
for
a
taxicab
and
went
but
kept
a
long
way
from
the
wholesale
section
where
stood
the
formidable
old
oblong
pile
of
lamb
and
company
he
arranged
for
the
sale
of
the
bonds
he
had
laid
away
and
for
placing
a
mortgage
upon
his
house
and
on
his
way
home
after
five
he
went
to
see
an
old
friend
a
man
whose
term
of
service
with
lamb
and
company
was
even
a
little
longer
than
his
own
this
veteran
returned
from
the
day
work
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
apartment
house
where
he
lived
but
when
the
cab
stopped
at
the
curb
he
rose
and
came
forward
offering
a
jocular
greeting
well
well
virgil
adams
i
always
thought
you
had
a
sporty
streak
in
you
travel
in
your
own
hired
private
automobile
nowadays
do
you
pamperin
yourself
because
you
still
layin
off
sick
i
oh
i
well
enough
again
charley
lohr
adams
said
as
he
got
out
and
shook
hands
then
telling
the
driver
to
wait
he
took
his
friend
arm
walked
to
the
bench
with
him
and
sat
down
i
been
practically
well
for
some
time
he
said
i
fixin
to
get
into
harness
bein
sick
has
certainly
produced
a
change
of
heart
in
you
his
friend
laughed
you
the
last
man
i
ever
expected
to
see
yourself
or
anybody
else
to
a
taxicab
for
that
matter
i
never
heard
of
you
bein
in
any
kind
of
a
cab
it
might
be
when
you
been
for
somebody
what
come
over
you
well
i
got
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
that
a
fact
adams
said
i
got
a
lot
to
do
and
the
only
way
to
accomplish
it
it
got
to
be
done
soon
or
i
wo
have
anything
to
live
on
while
i
doing
what
you
talkin
about
what
you
got
to
do
except
to
get
strong
enough
to
come
back
to
the
old
place
well
adams
paused
then
coughed
and
said
slowly
fact
is
charley
lohr
i
been
thinking
likely
i
would
come
what
what
you
talkin
about
no
said
adams
i
been
thinking
i
might
likely
kind
of
branch
out
on
my
own
well
i
be
doggoned
old
charley
lohr
was
amazed
he
ruffled
up
his
gray
moustache
with
thumb
and
forefinger
leaving
his
mouth
open
beneath
like
a
dark
cave
under
a
tangled
wintry
thicket
why
the
doggonedest
thing
i
ever
heard
he
said
i
already
am
the
oldest
inhabitant
down
there
but
if
you
go
there
wo
be
anybody
else
of
the
old
generation
at
all
what
on
earth
you
thinkin
of
goin
into
well
said
adams
i
rather
you
did
mention
it
till
i
get
started
of
course
anybody
know
what
it
is
by
then
but
i
have
been
kind
of
planning
to
put
a
liquid
glue
on
the
his
friend
still
ruffling
the
gray
moustache
upward
stared
at
him
in
frowning
perplexity
glue
he
said
glue
yes
i
been
sort
of
milling
over
the
idea
of
taking
up
something
like
handlin
it
for
some
firm
you
mean
no
making
it
sort
of
a
lohr
continued
to
frown
let
me
think
he
said
did
the
ole
man
have
some
such
idea
once
himself
adams
leaned
forward
rubbing
his
knees
and
he
coughed
again
before
he
spoke
well
yes
fact
is
he
did
that
is
to
say
a
mighty
long
while
ago
he
i
remember
said
lohr
he
never
said
anything
about
it
that
i
know
of
but
seems
to
me
i
recollect
we
had
sort
of
a
rumour
around
the
place
how
you
and
that
man
le
see
was
his
name
campbell
that
died
of
typhoid
fever
yes
that
was
it
campbell
did
the
ole
man
have
you
and
campbell
workin
sort
of
private
on
some
glue
proposition
or
other
yes
he
adams
nodded
i
found
out
a
good
deal
about
glue
then
been
workin
on
it
since
i
suppose
yes
kept
it
in
my
mind
and
studied
out
new
things
about
lohr
looked
serious
well
but
see
here
he
said
i
hope
it
anything
the
ole
man
think
might
infringe
on
whatever
he
had
you
doin
for
him
you
know
how
he
is
liberal
man
as
walks
this
earth
and
if
he
thought
he
owed
you
a
cent
he
sell
his
right
hand
for
a
to
pay
it
if
that
was
the
only
way
but
if
he
got
the
idea
anybody
was
tryin
to
get
the
better
of
him
sell
both
his
hands
if
he
had
to
to
keep
from
doin
it
yes
at
eighty
he
would
not
that
i
mean
i
think
you
might
be
tryin
to
get
the
better
of
him
virg
you
a
mighty
close
ole
codger
but
such
a
thing
ai
in
you
what
i
mean
i
hope
there
ai
any
chance
for
the
ole
man
to
think
you
might
be
oh
no
adams
interrupted
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
believe
ever
think
about
it
at
all
and
if
he
did
he
would
have
any
real
right
to
feel
offended
at
me
the
process
i
going
to
use
is
one
i
expect
to
change
and
improve
a
lot
different
from
the
one
campbell
and
i
worked
on
for
well
that
good
said
lohr
of
course
you
know
what
you
up
to
you
old
enough
god
knows
he
laughed
ruefully
my
but
it
will
seem
funny
to
me
down
there
with
you
gone
i
expect
you
and
i
both
been
gettin
to
be
pretty
much
in
the
place
the
way
the
young
fellows
look
at
it
and
the
only
one
that
miss
either
of
us
would
be
the
other
one
have
you
told
the
ole
man
yet
well
adams
spoke
laboriously
no
no
i
have
i
thought
well
that
what
i
wanted
to
see
you
what
can
i
do
i
thought
i
write
him
a
letter
and
get
you
to
hand
it
to
him
for
my
soul
his
friend
exclaimed
why
on
earth
do
you
just
go
down
there
and
tell
him
adams
became
pitiably
embarrassed
he
stammered
coughed
stammered
again
wrinkling
his
face
so
deeply
he
seemed
about
to
weep
but
finally
he
contrived
to
utter
an
apologetic
laugh
i
ought
to
do
that
of
course
but
in
some
way
or
other
i
just
do
seem
to
be
able
to
to
manage
why
in
the
world
not
the
mystified
lohr
inquired
i
could
hardly
tell
you
it
is
to
say
that
when
you
been
with
one
boss
all
your
life
it
so
so
kind
of
embarrassing
to
quit
him
i
just
ca
make
up
my
mind
to
go
and
speak
to
him
about
it
no
i
got
it
in
my
head
a
letter
the
only
satisfactory
way
to
do
it
and
i
thought
i
ask
you
to
hand
it
to
well
of
course
i
do
mind
doin
that
for
you
lohr
said
mildly
but
why
in
the
world
do
you
just
mail
it
to
him
well
i
tell
you
adams
returned
you
know
like
that
it
have
to
go
through
a
clerk
and
that
secretary
of
his
and
i
do
know
who
all
there
a
couple
of
kind
of
delicate
points
i
want
to
put
in
it
for
instance
i
want
to
explain
to
him
how
much
improvement
and
so
on
i
going
to
introduce
on
the
old
process
i
helped
to
work
out
with
campbell
when
we
were
working
for
him
he
understand
it
a
different
article
and
no
infringement
at
all
then
there
another
thing
you
see
all
during
while
i
was
sick
he
had
my
salary
paid
to
me
it
amounts
to
considerable
i
was
on
my
back
so
long
under
the
circumstances
because
i
quitting
i
do
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
accept
it
and
so
i
have
a
check
for
him
in
the
letter
to
cover
it
and
i
want
to
be
sure
he
knows
it
and
gets
it
personally
if
it
had
to
go
through
a
lot
of
other
people
the
way
it
would
if
i
put
it
in
the
mail
why
you
ca
tell
so
what
i
thought
if
you
hand
it
to
him
for
me
and
maybe
if
he
happened
to
read
it
right
then
or
anything
it
might
be
you
notice
whatever
he
happen
to
say
about
it
and
you
could
tell
me
all
right
lohr
said
certainly
if
you
rather
do
it
that
way
hand
it
to
him
and
tell
you
what
he
says
that
is
if
he
says
anything
and
i
hear
him
got
it
written
no
i
send
it
around
to
you
last
of
the
adams
moved
toward
his
taxicab
do
say
anything
to
anybody
about
it
charley
especially
till
after
all
and
charley
i
be
mighty
obliged
to
you
adams
said
and
came
back
to
shake
hands
in
farewell
there
one
thing
more
you
might
do
if
you
ever
happen
to
feel
like
he
kept
his
eyes
rather
vaguely
fixed
on
a
point
above
his
friend
head
as
he
spoke
and
his
voice
was
not
well
controlled
i
been
i
been
down
there
a
good
many
years
and
i
may
not
been
so
much
use
lately
as
i
was
at
first
but
i
always
tried
to
do
my
best
for
the
old
firm
if
anything
turned
out
so
they
did
kind
of
take
offense
with
me
down
there
why
just
say
a
good
word
for
me
if
you
happen
to
feel
like
it
old
charley
lohr
assured
him
that
he
would
speak
a
good
word
if
opportunity
became
available
then
after
the
cab
had
driven
away
he
went
up
to
his
small
apartment
on
the
third
floor
and
muttered
ruminatively
until
his
wife
inquired
what
he
was
talking
to
himself
about
ole
virg
adams
he
told
her
he
out
again
after
his
long
spell
of
sickness
and
the
way
it
looks
to
me
he
better
stayed
in
you
mean
he
still
looks
too
bad
to
be
out
oh
i
expect
he
gettin
his
health
back
lohr
said
frowning
then
what
the
matter
with
him
you
mean
he
lost
his
mind
my
goodness
but
women
do
jump
at
conclusions
he
exclaimed
well
said
lohr
what
other
conclusion
did
you
leave
me
to
jump
at
her
husband
explained
with
a
little
heat
people
can
have
a
sickness
that
affects
their
mind
ca
they
their
mind
can
get
some
affected
without
bein
lost
ca
it
then
you
mean
the
poor
man
mind
does
seem
affected
why
no
i
scarcely
go
as
far
as
that
lohr
said
inconsistently
and
declined
to
be
more
definite
adams
devoted
the
latter
part
of
that
evening
to
the
composition
of
his
letter
a
disquieting
task
not
completed
when
at
eleven
he
heard
his
daughter
coming
up
the
stairs
she
was
singing
to
herself
in
a
low
sweet
voice
and
adams
paused
to
listen
incredulously
with
his
pen
lifted
and
his
mouth
open
as
if
he
heard
the
strangest
sound
in
the
world
then
he
set
down
the
pen
upon
a
blotter
went
to
his
door
and
opened
it
looking
out
at
her
as
she
came
well
dearie
you
seem
to
be
feeling
pretty
good
he
said
what
you
been
doing
just
sitting
out
on
the
front
steps
all
alone
i
no
russell
oh
he
did
adams
pretended
to
be
surprised
what
all
could
you
and
he
find
to
talk
about
till
this
hour
o
the
night
she
laughed
gaily
you
do
know
me
papa
how
that
you
never
found
out
that
i
always
do
all
the
did
you
let
him
get
a
word
in
all
evening
oh
yes
every
now
and
adams
took
her
hand
and
petted
it
well
what
did
he
say
alice
gave
him
a
radiant
look
and
kissed
him
not
what
you
think
she
laughed
then
slapped
his
cheek
with
saucy
affection
pirouetted
across
the
narrow
hall
and
into
her
own
room
and
curtsied
to
him
as
she
closed
her
door
adams
went
back
to
his
writing
with
a
lighter
heart
for
since
alice
was
born
she
had
been
to
him
the
apple
of
his
eye
his
own
phrase
in
thinking
of
her
and
what
he
was
doing
now
was
for
her
he
smiled
as
he
picked
up
his
pen
to
begin
a
new
draft
of
the
painful
letter
but
presently
he
looked
puzzled
after
all
she
could
be
happy
just
as
things
were
it
seemed
then
why
had
he
taken
what
his
wife
called
this
new
step
which
he
had
so
long
resisted
he
could
only
sigh
and
wonder
life
works
out
pretty
peculiarly
he
thought
for
he
could
go
back
now
though
the
reason
he
could
was
not
clearly
apparent
he
had
to
go
ahead
chapter
xvii
he
was
out
in
his
taxicab
again
the
next
morning
and
by
noon
he
had
secured
what
he
wanted
it
was
curiously
significant
that
he
worked
so
quickly
all
the
years
during
which
his
wife
had
pressed
him
toward
his
present
shift
he
had
sworn
to
himself
as
well
as
to
her
that
he
would
never
yield
and
yet
when
he
did
yield
he
had
no
plans
to
make
because
he
found
them
already
prepared
and
worked
out
in
detail
in
his
mind
as
if
he
had
long
contemplated
the
step
he
believed
himself
incapable
of
taking
sometimes
he
had
thought
of
improving
his
income
by
exchanging
his
little
collection
of
bonds
for
a
small
rental
property
if
he
could
find
a
good
buy
and
he
had
spent
many
of
his
spare
hours
rambling
over
the
enormously
spreading
city
and
its
purlieus
looking
for
the
ideal
it
remained
unattainable
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
but
he
found
other
things
not
twice
a
crow
mile
from
his
own
house
there
was
a
dismal
and
slummish
quarter
a
decayed
industrial
district
of
earlier
days
most
of
the
industries
were
small
some
of
them
died
perishing
of
bankruptcy
or
fire
and
a
few
had
moved
leaving
their
shells
of
the
relics
the
best
was
a
brick
building
which
had
been
the
largest
and
most
important
factory
in
the
quarter
it
had
been
injured
by
a
long
vacancy
almost
as
serious
as
a
fire
in
effect
and
adams
had
often
guessed
at
the
sum
needed
to
put
it
in
repair
when
he
passed
it
he
would
look
at
it
with
an
interest
which
he
supposed
detached
and
idly
speculative
that
be
just
the
thing
he
thought
if
a
fellow
had
money
enough
and
took
a
notion
to
set
up
some
new
business
on
a
big
scale
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
place
to
make
glue
for
instance
if
that
was
out
of
the
question
of
course
it
would
take
a
lot
of
money
though
a
great
deal
too
much
for
me
to
expect
to
handle
even
if
i
ever
dream
of
doing
such
a
opposite
the
dismantled
factory
was
a
muddy
open
lot
of
two
acres
or
so
and
near
the
middle
of
the
lot
a
long
brick
shed
stood
in
a
desolate
abandonment
not
happily
decorated
by
old
coatings
of
theatrical
and
medicinal
advertisements
but
the
brick
shed
had
two
wooden
ells
and
though
both
shed
and
ells
were
of
a
single
story
here
was
empty
space
enough
for
a
modest
enterprise
space
enough
for
almost
anything
to
start
with
adams
thought
as
he
walked
through
the
low
buildings
one
day
when
he
was
prospecting
in
that
section
yes
i
suppose
i
could
swing
this
he
thought
if
the
process
belonged
to
me
say
instead
of
being
out
of
the
question
because
it
is
my
property
or
if
i
was
the
kind
of
man
to
do
such
a
thing
anyhow
here
would
be
something
i
could
probably
get
hold
of
pretty
cheap
want
a
lot
of
money
for
a
lease
on
that
big
building
over
the
way
but
this
why
i
should
think
it
be
practically
nothing
at
then
by
chance
meeting
an
agent
he
knew
he
made
inquiries
merely
to
satisfy
a
casual
curiosity
he
thought
and
he
found
matters
much
as
he
had
supposed
except
that
the
owners
of
the
big
building
did
not
wish
to
let
but
to
sell
it
and
this
at
a
price
so
exorbitant
that
adams
laughed
but
the
long
brick
shed
in
the
great
muddy
lot
was
for
sale
or
to
let
or
pretty
near
to
be
given
away
he
learned
if
anybody
would
take
it
adams
took
it
now
though
without
seeing
that
he
had
been
destined
to
take
it
and
that
some
dreary
wizard
in
the
back
of
his
head
had
foreseen
all
along
that
he
would
take
it
and
planned
to
be
ready
he
drove
in
his
taxicab
to
look
the
place
over
again
then
to
arrange
for
a
lease
and
came
home
to
lunch
with
his
wife
and
daughter
things
were
moving
he
told
them
he
boasted
a
little
of
having
acted
so
decisively
and
said
that
since
the
dang
thing
had
to
be
done
it
was
going
to
be
done
right
he
was
almost
cheerful
in
a
feverish
way
and
when
the
cab
came
for
him
again
soon
after
lunch
he
explained
that
he
intended
not
only
to
get
things
done
right
but
also
to
get
done
quick
alice
following
him
to
the
front
door
looked
at
him
anxiously
and
asked
if
she
could
help
he
laughed
at
her
grimly
then
let
me
go
along
with
you
in
the
cab
she
begged
you
do
look
able
to
start
in
so
hard
papa
just
when
you
barely
beginning
to
get
your
strength
back
do
let
me
go
with
you
and
see
if
i
ca
help
or
at
least
take
care
of
you
if
you
should
get
to
feeling
he
declined
but
upon
pressure
let
her
put
a
tiny
bottle
of
spirits
of
ammonia
in
his
pocket
and
promised
to
make
use
of
it
if
he
felt
faint
or
then
he
was
off
again
and
the
next
morning
had
men
at
work
in
his
sheds
though
the
wages
he
had
to
pay
frightened
him
he
directed
the
workmen
in
every
detail
hurrying
them
by
example
and
exhortations
and
receiving
in
consequence
several
declarations
of
independence
as
well
as
one
resignation
which
took
effect
immediately
yous
capitalusts
seem
to
think
a
man
got
nothin
to
do
but
break
his
back
wealth
fer
yous
to
squander
the
resigning
person
loudly
complained
you
look
out
the
toiler
day
is
and
it
ai
so
fur
off
neither
but
the
capitalist
was
already
out
of
hearing
gone
to
find
a
man
to
take
this
orator
place
by
the
end
of
the
week
adams
felt
that
he
had
moved
satisfactorily
forward
in
his
preparations
for
the
simple
equipment
he
needed
but
he
hated
the
pause
of
sunday
he
did
want
any
rest
he
told
alice
impatiently
when
she
suggested
that
the
idle
day
might
be
good
for
him
late
that
afternoon
he
walked
over
to
the
apartment
house
where
old
charley
lohr
lived
and
gave
his
friend
the
letter
he
wanted
the
head
of
lamb
and
company
to
receive
i
take
it
as
a
mighty
great
favour
in
you
to
hand
it
to
him
personally
charley
he
said
in
parting
and
you
wo
forget
in
case
he
says
anything
about
it
and
remember
if
you
ever
do
get
a
chance
to
put
in
a
good
word
for
me
later
you
know
old
charley
promised
to
remember
and
when
lohr
came
out
of
the
kitchenette
after
the
door
closed
he
said
thoughtfully
just
skin
and
you
mean
adams
is
lohr
inquired
who
you
think
i
meant
he
returned
one
o
these
partridges
in
the
did
he
look
so
badly
looked
kind
of
distracted
to
me
her
husband
replied
these
little
thin
fellers
can
stand
a
heap
sometimes
though
he
be
over
here
again
did
he
say
he
would
no
said
lohr
but
he
will
you
see
he
be
over
to
find
out
what
the
big
boss
says
when
i
give
him
this
letter
expect
i
be
kind
of
anxious
myself
if
i
was
why
would
you
what
adams
doing
to
be
so
anxious
about
lohr
expression
became
one
of
reserve
the
look
of
a
man
who
has
found
that
when
he
speaks
his
inner
thoughts
his
wife
jumps
too
far
to
conclusions
oh
nothing
he
said
of
course
any
man
starting
up
a
new
business
is
bound
to
be
pretty
nervous
a
while
he
be
over
here
evening
all
right
you
the
prediction
was
fulfilled
adams
arrived
just
after
lohr
had
removed
the
dinner
dishes
to
her
kitchenette
but
lohr
had
little
information
to
give
his
caller
he
did
say
a
word
virgil
nary
a
word
i
took
it
into
his
office
and
handed
it
to
him
and
he
just
sat
and
read
it
that
all
i
kind
of
stood
around
as
long
as
i
could
but
he
was
sittin
at
his
desk
with
his
side
to
me
and
he
never
turned
around
full
toward
me
as
it
were
so
i
could
hardly
even
tell
anything
all
i
know
he
just
read
well
but
see
here
adams
began
nervously
well
well
what
virg
well
but
what
did
he
say
when
he
did
speak
he
did
speak
not
so
long
i
was
in
there
anyhow
he
just
sat
there
and
read
it
read
kind
of
slow
then
when
he
came
to
the
end
he
turned
back
and
started
to
read
it
all
over
again
by
that
time
there
was
three
or
four
other
men
standin
around
in
the
office
waitin
to
speak
to
him
and
i
had
to
adams
sighed
and
stared
at
the
floor
irresolute
well
i
be
getting
along
back
home
then
i
guess
charley
so
you
sure
you
could
tell
anything
what
he
might
have
thought
about
it
then
not
a
thing
in
the
world
i
told
you
all
i
know
i
guess
so
i
guess
so
adams
said
mournfully
i
feel
mighty
obliged
to
you
charley
lohr
mighty
obliged
to
and
he
departed
sighing
in
perplexity
on
his
way
home
preoccupied
with
many
thoughts
he
walked
so
slowly
that
once
or
twice
he
stopped
and
stood
motionless
for
a
few
moments
without
being
aware
of
it
and
when
he
reached
the
juncture
of
the
sidewalk
with
the
short
brick
path
that
led
to
his
own
front
door
he
stopped
again
and
stood
for
more
than
a
minute
ah
i
wish
i
knew
he
whispered
plaintively
i
do
wish
i
knew
what
he
thought
about
he
was
roused
by
a
laugh
that
came
lightly
from
the
little
veranda
near
by
papa
alice
called
gaily
what
are
you
standing
there
muttering
to
yourself
about
oh
are
you
there
dearie
he
said
and
came
up
the
path
a
tall
figure
rose
from
a
chair
on
the
veranda
papa
this
is
the
two
men
shook
hands
adams
saying
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
as
they
looked
at
each
other
in
the
faint
light
diffused
through
the
opaque
glass
in
the
upper
part
of
the
door
impression
was
of
a
strong
and
tall
young
man
fashionable
but
gentle
and
russell
was
of
a
dried
little
old
business
man
with
a
grizzled
moustache
worried
bright
eyes
shapeless
dark
clothes
and
a
homely
manner
nice
evening
adams
said
further
as
their
hands
parted
nice
time
year
it
is
but
we
do
always
have
as
good
weather
as
this
the
trouble
of
it
well
he
went
to
the
door
well
i
bid
you
good
evening
he
said
and
retired
within
the
house
alice
laughed
he
the
man
in
town
i
suppose
and
frightfully
impressed
with
you
i
could
see
what
nonsense
said
russell
how
could
anybody
be
impressed
with
me
why
not
because
you
quiet
good
gracious
do
you
know
that
you
the
most
impressive
sort
we
chatterers
spend
all
our
time
playing
to
you
quiet
yes
we
only
the
she
echoed
why
we
live
for
you
and
we
ca
live
without
i
wish
you
could
said
russell
that
would
be
a
new
experience
for
both
of
us
would
it
it
might
be
a
rather
bleak
one
for
me
she
answered
lightly
afraid
i
miss
these
summer
evenings
with
you
when
they
over
miss
them
enough
thanks
do
they
have
to
be
over
some
time
he
asked
oh
everything
over
some
time
is
it
russell
laughed
at
her
do
let
look
so
far
ahead
as
that
he
said
we
do
need
to
be
already
thinking
of
the
cemetery
do
we
i
did
she
said
shaking
her
head
our
summer
evenings
will
be
over
before
then
why
he
asked
good
heavens
she
said
there
laconic
eloquence
almost
a
proposal
in
a
single
word
never
mind
i
sha
hold
you
to
it
but
to
answer
you
well
i
always
looking
ahead
and
somehow
i
usually
see
about
how
things
are
coming
yes
he
said
i
suppose
most
of
us
do
at
least
it
seems
as
if
we
did
because
we
so
seldom
feel
surprised
by
the
way
they
do
come
out
but
maybe
that
only
because
life
is
like
a
play
in
a
theatre
and
most
things
come
about
so
gradually
we
get
used
to
no
i
sure
i
can
see
quite
a
long
way
ahead
she
insisted
gravely
and
it
does
seem
to
me
as
if
our
summer
evenings
could
last
very
long
something
interfere
somebody
will
i
mean
they
say
something
what
if
they
do
she
moved
her
shoulders
in
a
little
apprehensive
shiver
it
change
you
she
said
i
just
sure
something
spiteful
going
to
happen
to
me
you
feel
differently
about
now
is
that
an
idea
he
exclaimed
it
will
she
insisted
i
know
something
spiteful
going
to
happen
you
seem
possessed
by
a
notion
not
a
bit
flattering
to
me
he
remarked
oh
but
is
it
that
just
what
it
is
why
is
it
because
it
implies
that
i
made
of
such
soft
material
the
slightest
breeze
will
mess
me
all
up
i
not
so
like
that
as
i
evidently
appear
and
if
it
true
that
we
afraid
other
people
will
do
the
things
be
most
likely
to
do
ourselves
it
seems
to
me
that
i
ought
to
be
the
one
to
be
afraid
i
ought
to
be
afraid
that
somebody
may
say
something
about
me
to
you
that
will
make
you
believe
i
a
professional
no
we
both
know
they
wo
she
said
we
both
know
you
the
sort
of
person
everybody
in
the
world
says
nice
things
she
lifted
her
hand
to
silence
him
as
he
laughed
at
this
oh
of
course
you
are
i
think
perhaps
you
a
little
flirtatious
most
quiet
men
have
that
one
sly
way
with
oh
yes
they
do
but
you
happen
to
be
the
kind
of
man
everybody
loves
to
praise
and
if
you
were
should
hear
anything
terrible
about
you
i
told
you
i
was
unpopular
i
do
see
anybody
at
all
any
more
the
only
man
except
you
who
been
to
see
me
in
a
month
is
that
fearful
little
fat
frank
dowling
and
i
sent
word
to
him
i
was
home
nobody
tell
me
of
your
wickedness
you
then
let
me
break
some
news
to
you
russell
said
nobody
would
tell
me
of
yours
either
nobody
even
mentioned
you
to
she
burlesqued
a
cry
of
anguish
that
is
obscurity
i
suppose
too
apt
to
forget
that
they
say
the
population
about
half
a
million
nowadays
there
are
other
people
to
talk
about
you
feel
then
none
that
i
want
to
he
said
but
i
should
think
the
size
of
the
place
might
relieve
your
mind
of
what
seems
to
insist
on
burdening
it
besides
i
rather
you
thought
me
a
better
man
than
you
what
kind
of
a
man
do
i
think
you
are
the
kind
affected
by
what
said
about
people
instead
of
by
what
they
do
are
you
no
i
not
he
said
if
you
want
our
summer
evenings
to
be
over
you
have
to
drive
me
away
nobody
else
could
she
was
silent
leaning
forward
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
clasped
hands
against
her
lips
then
not
moving
she
said
softly
well
i
wo
she
was
silent
again
and
he
said
nothing
but
looked
at
her
seeming
to
be
content
with
looking
her
attitude
was
one
only
a
graceful
person
should
assume
but
she
was
graceful
and
in
the
wan
light
which
made
a
prettily
shaped
mist
of
her
she
had
beauty
perhaps
it
was
beauty
of
the
hour
and
of
the
love
scene
almost
made
into
form
by
what
they
had
both
just
said
but
she
had
it
and
though
beauty
of
the
hour
passes
he
who
sees
it
will
long
remember
it
and
the
hour
when
it
came
what
are
you
thinking
of
he
asked
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
did
not
answer
at
once
then
she
said
i
do
know
i
doubt
if
i
was
thinking
of
anything
it
seems
to
me
i
was
i
think
i
was
just
being
sort
of
sadly
happy
just
were
you
was
it
too
do
you
know
she
said
it
seems
to
me
that
only
little
children
can
be
just
happily
happy
i
think
when
we
get
older
our
happiest
moments
are
like
the
one
i
had
just
then
it
as
if
we
heard
strains
of
minor
music
running
through
them
oh
so
sweet
but
oh
so
sad
but
what
makes
it
sad
for
you
i
do
know
she
said
in
a
lighter
tone
perhaps
it
a
kind
of
useless
foreboding
i
seem
to
have
pretty
often
it
may
be
that
or
it
may
be
poor
you
are
a
funny
delightful
girl
though
russell
laughed
when
your
father
so
well
again
that
he
goes
out
walking
in
the
evenings
he
does
too
much
walking
alice
said
too
much
altogether
over
at
his
new
plant
but
there
is
any
stopping
she
laughed
and
shook
her
head
when
a
man
gets
an
ambition
to
be
a
his
family
do
appear
to
have
much
weight
with
him
he
walk
all
he
wants
to
in
spite
of
i
suppose
so
russell
said
absently
then
he
leaned
forward
i
wish
i
could
understand
better
why
you
were
meanwhile
as
alice
shed
what
further
light
she
could
on
this
point
the
man
ambitious
to
be
a
was
indeed
walking
too
much
for
his
own
good
he
had
gone
to
bed
hoping
to
sleep
well
and
rise
early
for
a
long
day
work
but
he
could
not
rest
and
now
in
his
nightgown
and
slippers
he
was
pacing
the
floor
of
his
room
i
wish
i
did
know
he
thought
over
and
over
i
do
wish
i
knew
how
he
feels
about
chapter
xviii
that
was
a
thought
almost
continuously
in
his
mind
even
when
he
was
hardest
at
work
and
as
the
days
went
on
and
he
could
not
free
himself
he
became
querulous
about
it
i
guess
i
the
biggest
dang
fool
alive
he
told
his
wife
as
they
sat
together
one
evening
i
got
plenty
else
to
bother
me
without
worrying
my
head
off
about
what
he
thinks
i
ca
help
what
he
thinks
it
too
late
for
that
so
why
should
i
keep
pestering
myself
about
it
it
wear
off
virgil
adams
said
reassuringly
she
was
gentle
and
sympathetic
with
him
and
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
he
would
come
to
sit
with
her
and
talk
when
he
had
finished
his
day
work
he
had
told
her
evading
her
eye
oh
i
do
blame
you
you
did
get
after
me
to
do
this
on
your
own
account
you
could
help
yes
but
it
do
wear
off
he
complained
this
afternoon
i
was
showing
the
men
how
i
wanted
my
vats
to
go
and
i
caught
my
fool
self
standing
there
saying
to
my
fool
self
funny
i
do
hear
how
he
feels
about
it
from
somebody
i
was
saying
it
aloud
almost
and
it
is
funny
i
do
hear
anything
well
you
see
what
it
means
do
you
virgil
it
only
means
he
said
anything
to
anybody
about
it
do
you
think
you
getting
kind
of
morbid
over
it
maybe
maybe
he
muttered
why
yes
she
said
briskly
you
do
realize
what
a
little
bit
of
a
thing
all
this
is
to
him
it
been
a
long
long
while
since
the
last
time
you
even
mentioned
glue
to
him
and
he
probably
forgotten
everything
about
you
off
your
base
it
is
like
him
to
forget
things
adams
returned
peevishly
he
may
seem
to
forget
but
he
but
he
not
thinking
about
this
or
you
have
heard
from
him
before
her
husband
shook
his
head
ah
that
just
it
he
said
why
i
heard
from
him
it
all
your
morbidness
virgil
look
at
walter
if
lamb
held
this
up
against
you
would
he
still
let
walter
stay
there
would
he
have
discharged
walter
if
he
felt
angry
with
you
that
dang
boy
adams
said
if
he
wanted
to
come
with
me
now
i
would
hardly
let
him
what
do
you
suppose
makes
him
so
but
has
he
a
right
to
choose
for
himself
she
asked
i
suppose
he
feels
he
ought
to
stick
to
what
he
thinks
is
sure
pay
as
soon
as
he
sees
that
you
going
to
succeed
with
the
he
want
to
be
with
you
quick
well
he
better
get
a
little
sense
in
his
head
adams
returned
crossly
he
wanted
me
to
pay
him
a
bonus
in
advance
when
anybody
with
a
grain
of
common
sense
knows
i
need
every
penny
i
can
lay
my
hands
on
never
mind
she
said
he
come
around
later
and
be
glad
of
the
he
have
to
beg
for
it
then
wo
ask
him
oh
walter
will
come
out
all
right
you
need
worry
and
do
you
see
that
lamb
not
discharging
him
means
there
no
hard
feeling
against
you
virgil
i
ca
make
it
out
at
all
he
said
frowning
the
only
thing
i
can
think
it
means
is
that
j
lamb
is
so
and
of
course
he
is
one
of
the
men
alive
i
suppose
that
the
reason
he
has
fired
walter
he
may
know
adams
concluded
morosely
he
may
know
that
just
another
thing
to
make
me
feel
all
the
meaner
keeping
my
boy
there
on
a
salary
after
i
done
him
an
now
now
she
said
trying
to
comfort
him
you
could
do
anybody
an
injury
to
save
your
life
and
everybody
knows
well
anybody
ought
to
know
i
would
want
to
do
an
injury
but
this
world
is
built
we
can
do
just
what
we
he
paused
reflecting
of
course
there
may
be
one
explanation
of
why
still
there
j
maybe
has
noticed
that
he
is
there
there
so
many
i
expect
he
hardly
knows
him
by
well
just
do
quit
thinking
about
it
she
urged
him
it
only
bothers
you
without
doing
any
good
do
you
know
that
do
i
though
he
laughed
feebly
i
know
it
anybody
how
funny
that
is
when
you
know
thinking
about
a
thing
only
pesters
you
without
helping
anything
at
all
and
yet
you
keep
right
on
pestering
yourself
with
it
but
why
she
said
what
the
use
when
you
know
you
have
done
anything
wrong
virgil
you
said
yourself
you
were
going
to
improve
the
process
so
much
it
would
be
different
from
the
old
one
and
you
really
have
a
right
to
adams
had
persuaded
himself
of
this
when
he
yielded
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
persuade
himself
of
it
though
there
was
a
part
of
him
of
course
that
remained
unpersuaded
and
this
discomfiting
part
of
him
was
what
made
his
present
trouble
yes
i
know
he
said
that
true
but
i
ca
quite
seem
to
get
away
from
the
fact
that
the
principle
of
the
process
is
a
good
deal
the
same
well
it
that
it
just
about
the
same
as
the
one
he
hired
campbell
and
me
to
work
out
for
him
truth
is
nobody
could
tell
the
difference
and
i
do
know
as
there
is
any
difference
except
in
these
improvements
i
making
of
course
the
improvements
do
give
me
pretty
near
a
perfect
right
to
it
as
a
person
might
say
and
that
one
of
the
things
i
thought
of
putting
in
my
letter
to
him
but
i
was
afraid
he
just
think
i
was
trying
to
make
up
excuses
so
i
left
it
out
i
kind
of
worried
all
the
time
i
was
writing
that
letter
because
if
he
thought
i
was
just
making
up
excuses
why
it
might
set
him
just
so
much
more
against
ever
since
adams
had
found
that
she
was
to
have
her
way
the
depths
of
her
eyes
had
been
troubled
by
a
continuous
uneasiness
and
although
she
knew
it
was
there
and
sometimes
veiled
it
by
keeping
the
revealing
eyes
averted
from
her
husband
and
children
she
could
not
always
cover
it
under
that
assumption
of
the
uneasy
look
became
vivid
and
her
voice
was
slightly
tremulous
now
as
she
said
but
what
if
he
should
be
against
you
although
i
do
believe
he
is
of
course
you
told
me
he
could
do
anything
to
you
no
he
said
slowly
i
ca
see
how
he
could
do
anything
it
was
just
a
secret
not
a
patent
the
thing
ai
patentable
i
tried
to
think
what
he
could
do
supposing
he
was
to
want
to
but
i
ca
figure
out
anything
at
all
that
would
be
any
harm
to
me
there
is
any
way
in
the
world
it
could
be
made
a
question
of
law
only
thing
he
could
be
to
tell
people
his
side
of
it
and
set
against
me
i
been
kind
of
waiting
for
that
to
happen
all
she
looked
somewhat
relieved
so
did
i
expect
it
she
said
i
was
dreading
it
most
on
alice
account
it
might
have
well
young
men
are
so
easily
influenced
and
all
but
so
far
as
the
business
is
concerned
what
if
lamb
did
talk
that
would
amount
to
much
it
affect
the
business
not
to
hurt
and
besides
he
is
even
doing
no
anyhow
not
yet
it
and
adams
sighed
again
wistfully
but
i
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know
what
he
thinks
before
his
surrender
he
had
always
supposed
that
if
he
did
such
an
unthinkable
thing
as
to
seize
upon
the
glue
process
for
himself
what
he
would
feel
must
be
an
overpowering
shame
but
shame
is
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
what
he
felt
was
this
unremittent
curiosity
about
his
old
employer
thoughts
it
was
an
obsession
yet
he
did
not
want
to
hear
what
lamb
thought
from
lamb
himself
for
adams
had
a
second
obsession
and
this
was
his
dread
of
meeting
the
old
man
face
to
face
such
an
encounter
could
happen
only
by
chance
and
unexpectedly
since
adams
would
have
avoided
any
deliberate
meeting
so
long
as
his
legs
had
strength
to
carry
him
even
if
lamb
came
to
the
house
to
see
him
but
people
do
meet
unexpectedly
and
when
adams
had
to
be
he
kept
away
from
the
wholesale
one
day
he
did
see
lamb
as
the
latter
went
by
in
his
car
impassive
going
home
to
lunch
and
adams
in
the
crowd
at
a
corner
knew
that
the
old
man
had
not
seen
him
nevertheless
in
a
street
car
on
the
way
back
to
his
sheds
an
hour
later
he
was
still
subject
to
little
shivering
seizures
of
horror
he
worked
unceasingly
seeming
to
keep
at
it
even
in
his
sleep
for
he
always
woke
in
the
midst
of
a
planning
and
estimating
that
must
have
been
going
on
in
his
mind
before
consciousness
of
himself
returned
moreover
the
work
thus
urged
went
rapidly
in
spite
of
the
high
wages
he
had
to
pay
his
labourers
for
their
short
hours
it
eats
money
he
complained
and
in
fact
by
the
time
his
vats
and
boilers
were
in
place
it
had
eaten
almost
all
he
could
supply
but
in
addition
to
his
equipment
he
now
owned
a
stock
of
raw
material
raw
indeed
and
when
operations
should
be
a
little
further
along
he
was
confident
his
banker
would
be
willing
to
carry
him
six
weeks
from
the
day
he
had
obtained
his
lease
he
began
his
the
terrible
smells
came
out
of
the
sheds
and
went
writhing
like
snakes
all
through
that
quarter
of
the
town
a
smiling
man
strolling
and
breathing
the
air
with
satisfaction
would
turn
a
corner
and
smile
no
more
but
hurry
however
coloured
people
had
almost
all
the
dwellings
of
this
old
section
to
themselves
and
although
even
they
were
troubled
there
was
recompense
for
them
being
philosophic
about
what
appeared
to
them
as
in
the
order
of
nature
they
sought
neither
escape
nor
redress
and
soon
learned
to
bear
what
the
wind
brought
them
they
even
made
use
of
it
to
enrich
those
figures
of
speech
with
which
the
native
impulses
of
coloured
people
decorate
their
communications
they
flavoured
metaphor
simile
and
invective
with
it
and
thus
may
be
said
to
have
enjoyed
it
but
the
man
who
produced
it
took
a
hot
bath
as
soon
as
he
reached
his
home
the
evening
of
that
first
day
when
his
manufacturing
began
then
he
put
on
fresh
clothes
but
after
dinner
he
seemed
to
be
haunted
and
asked
his
wife
if
she
noticed
she
laughed
and
inquired
what
he
meant
seems
to
me
as
if
that
smell
had
quit
hanging
to
me
he
explained
do
you
notice
it
no
what
an
idea
he
laughed
too
but
uneasily
and
told
her
he
was
sure
the
dang
glue
smell
was
somehow
sticking
to
him
later
he
went
outdoors
and
walked
up
and
down
the
small
yard
in
the
dusk
but
now
and
then
he
stood
still
with
his
head
lifted
and
sniffed
the
air
suspiciously
can
you
smell
it
he
called
to
alice
who
sat
upon
the
veranda
prettily
dressed
and
waiting
in
a
reverie
smell
what
papa
that
dang
she
did
the
same
thing
her
mother
had
done
laughed
and
said
no
how
foolish
why
papa
it
over
two
miles
from
here
you
do
get
it
at
all
he
insisted
the
idea
the
air
is
lovely
the
air
did
not
seem
lovely
to
him
for
he
was
positive
that
he
detected
the
taint
he
wondered
how
far
it
carried
and
if
j
lamb
would
smell
it
too
out
on
his
own
lawn
a
mile
to
the
north
and
if
he
did
would
he
guess
what
it
was
then
adams
laughed
at
himself
for
such
nonsense
but
could
not
rid
his
nostrils
of
their
disgust
to
him
the
whole
town
seemed
to
smell
of
his
nevertheless
the
glue
was
making
and
his
sheds
were
busy
guess
we
stirrin
up
this
ole
neighbourhood
with
more
than
the
smell
his
foreman
remarked
one
morning
how
that
adams
inquired
that
great
big
enormous
ole
dead
butterine
factory
across
the
street
from
our
lot
the
man
said
nothin
like
settin
an
example
to
bring
real
estate
to
life
that
place
is
full
o
carpenters
startin
in
to
make
a
regular
buildin
of
it
again
guess
you
ought
to
have
the
credit
of
it
because
you
was
the
first
man
in
ten
years
to
see
any
possibilities
in
this
adams
was
pleased
and
going
out
to
see
for
himself
heard
a
great
hammering
and
sawing
from
within
the
building
while
carpenters
were
just
emerging
gingerly
upon
the
dangerous
roof
he
walked
out
over
the
dried
mud
of
his
deep
lot
crossed
the
street
and
spoke
genially
to
a
workman
who
was
removing
the
broken
glass
of
a
window
on
the
ground
floor
here
what
all
this
over
here
goin
to
fix
her
all
up
i
guess
the
workman
said
big
job
it
is
sh
think
it
would
yes
sir
a
pretty
big
job
a
pretty
big
job
got
men
at
it
on
all
four
floors
and
on
the
roof
they
doin
it
who
doing
it
lord
i
d
know
some
o
these
here
big
manufacturing
corporations
i
what
it
going
to
be
they
tell
me
the
workman
answered
they
tell
me
she
goin
to
be
a
butterine
factory
again
anyways
i
hope
she
wo
be
anything
to
smell
like
that
you
got
over
there
not
while
i
workin
around
her
anyways
that
smell
all
right
adams
said
you
soon
get
used
to
you
do
the
man
appeared
incredulous
listen
i
was
over
in
france
it
a
good
thing
them
dutchmen
never
thought
of
it
we
of
had
to
quit
adams
laughed
and
went
back
to
his
sheds
i
guess
my
foreman
was
right
he
told
his
wife
that
evening
with
a
little
satisfaction
as
soon
as
one
man
shows
enterprise
enough
to
found
an
industry
in
a
neighbourhood
somebody
else
is
sure
to
follow
i
kind
of
like
the
look
of
it
it
help
make
our
place
seem
sort
of
more
busy
and
prosperous
when
it
comes
to
getting
a
loan
from
the
bank
and
i
got
to
get
one
mighty
soon
too
i
did
think
some
that
if
things
go
as
well
as
there
every
reason
to
think
they
ought
to
i
might
want
to
spread
out
and
maybe
get
hold
of
that
old
factory
myself
but
i
hardly
expected
to
be
able
to
handle
a
proposition
of
that
size
before
two
or
three
years
from
now
and
anyhow
there
room
enough
on
the
lot
i
got
if
we
need
more
buildings
some
day
things
are
going
about
as
fine
as
i
could
ask
i
hired
some
girls
to
do
the
bottling
coloured
girls
along
about
sixteen
to
twenty
years
old
afterwhile
i
expect
to
get
a
machine
to
put
the
stuff
in
the
little
bottles
when
we
begin
to
get
good
returns
but
half
a
dozen
of
these
coloured
girls
can
do
it
all
right
now
by
hand
we
getting
to
have
really
quite
a
little
plant
over
there
yes
sir
quite
a
regular
little
plant
he
chuckled
and
at
this
cheerful
sound
of
a
kind
his
wife
had
almost
forgotten
he
was
capable
of
producing
she
ventured
to
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
they
had
gone
outdoors
after
dinner
taking
two
chairs
with
them
and
were
sitting
through
the
late
twilight
together
keeping
well
away
from
the
front
porch
which
was
not
yet
occupied
however
alice
was
in
her
room
changing
her
dress
well
honey
adams
said
taking
confidence
not
only
to
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
but
to
revive
this
disused
endearment
it
grand
to
have
you
so
optimistic
maybe
some
time
you
admit
i
was
right
after
all
everything
going
so
well
it
seems
a
pity
you
did
take
this
this
step
long
ago
do
you
think
maybe
so
virgil
well
if
i
was
ever
going
to
i
do
know
but
i
might
as
well
of
i
got
to
admit
the
proposition
begins
to
look
pretty
good
i
know
the
stuff
sell
and
i
ca
see
a
thing
in
the
world
to
stop
it
it
does
look
good
and
if
if
he
paused
if
what
she
said
suddenly
anxious
he
laughed
plaintively
as
if
confessing
a
superstition
funny
well
it
mighty
funny
about
that
smell
i
got
so
used
to
it
at
the
plant
i
never
seem
to
notice
it
at
all
over
there
it
only
when
i
get
away
honestly
ca
you
notice
virgil
she
lifted
her
hand
to
strike
his
arm
chidingly
do
quit
harping
on
that
nonsense
oh
of
course
it
do
amount
to
anything
he
said
a
person
can
stand
a
good
deal
of
just
smell
it
do
worry
me
i
should
think
not
especially
as
there
is
well
he
said
i
feel
pretty
fair
over
the
whole
thing
a
lot
i
ever
expected
to
anyhow
i
do
know
as
there
any
reason
i
should
tell
you
she
was
deeply
pleased
with
this
acknowledgment
and
her
voice
had
tenderness
in
it
as
she
responded
there
honey
did
i
always
say
you
be
glad
if
you
did
it
embarrassed
he
coughed
loudly
then
filled
his
pipe
and
lit
it
well
he
said
slowly
it
a
puzzle
yes
sir
it
a
what
is
pretty
much
everything
i
as
he
spoke
a
song
came
to
them
from
a
lighted
window
over
their
heads
then
the
window
darkened
abruptly
but
the
song
continued
as
alice
went
down
through
the
house
to
wait
on
the
little
veranda
mi
chiamo
mimi
she
sang
and
in
her
voice
throbbed
something
almost
startling
in
its
sweetness
her
father
and
mother
listened
not
speaking
until
the
song
stopped
with
the
click
of
the
wire
screen
at
the
front
door
as
alice
came
out
my
said
her
father
how
sweet
she
does
sing
i
do
know
as
i
ever
heard
her
voice
sound
nicer
than
it
did
just
there
something
that
makes
it
sound
that
way
his
wife
told
him
i
suppose
so
he
said
sighing
i
suppose
so
you
think
she
just
terribly
in
love
with
him
i
expect
that
the
way
it
ought
to
be
he
said
then
drew
upon
his
pipe
for
reflection
and
became
murmurous
with
the
symptoms
of
melancholy
laughter
it
do
make
things
less
of
a
puzzle
though
does
it
in
what
way
virgil
why
here
he
said
here
we
go
through
all
this
muck
and
moil
to
help
fix
things
nicer
for
her
at
home
and
what
it
all
amount
to
seems
like
she
just
gone
ahead
the
way
she
gone
anyhow
and
now
i
suppose
getting
ready
to
up
and
leave
us
ai
that
a
puzzle
to
you
it
is
to
oh
but
things
have
gone
that
far
why
you
just
said
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
protest
oh
they
are
engaged
yet
of
course
they
will
be
he
just
as
much
interested
in
her
as
she
is
in
him
but
well
what
the
trouble
then
you
are
a
simple
old
fellow
his
wife
exclaimed
and
then
rose
from
her
chair
that
reminds
me
she
said
what
of
he
asked
what
my
being
simple
remind
you
of
nothing
she
laughed
it
was
you
that
reminded
me
it
was
just
something
that
been
on
my
mind
i
do
believe
he
actually
ever
been
inside
our
house
has
he
i
actually
do
believe
he
ever
has
she
said
of
course
we
must
she
paused
debating
we
must
what
i
guess
i
better
talk
to
alice
about
it
right
now
she
said
he
usually
come
for
about
half
an
hour
yet
i
guess
i
got
and
with
that
she
walked
away
leaving
him
to
his
puzzles
chapter
xix
alice
was
softly
crooning
to
herself
as
her
mother
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
and
approached
through
the
dusk
is
it
the
most
beautiful
evening
the
daughter
said
why
summer
last
all
year
did
you
ever
know
a
lovelier
twilight
than
this
mama
adams
laughed
and
answered
not
since
i
was
your
age
i
alice
was
wistful
at
once
do
they
stay
beautiful
after
my
age
well
it
not
the
same
is
it
not
ever
you
may
have
a
different
kind
from
mine
the
mother
said
a
little
sadly
i
think
you
will
alice
you
deserve
no
i
do
i
do
deserve
anything
and
i
know
it
but
i
getting
a
great
deal
these
days
more
than
i
ever
dreamed
could
come
to
me
i
i
pretty
happy
mama
dearie
her
mother
would
have
kissed
her
but
alice
drew
away
oh
i
do
mean
she
laughed
nervously
i
was
meaning
to
tell
you
i
engaged
mama
we
not
i
mean
oh
things
seem
pretty
beautiful
in
spite
of
all
i
done
to
spoil
you
adams
cried
incredulously
what
have
you
done
to
spoil
anything
little
things
alice
said
a
thousand
little
silly
oh
the
use
he
so
honestly
what
he
is
just
simple
and
good
and
intelligent
i
feel
a
tricky
mess
beside
him
i
do
see
why
he
likes
me
and
sometimes
i
afraid
he
would
if
he
knew
he
just
worship
you
said
the
fond
mother
and
the
more
he
knew
you
the
more
he
worship
alice
shook
her
head
he
not
the
worshiping
kind
not
like
that
at
all
he
more
but
adams
was
not
interested
in
this
analysis
and
she
interrupted
briskly
of
course
it
time
your
father
and
i
showed
some
interest
in
him
i
was
just
saying
i
actually
do
believe
he
ever
been
inside
the
no
alice
said
musingly
that
true
i
do
believe
he
has
except
when
we
walked
in
the
evening
we
always
sat
out
here
even
those
two
times
when
it
was
drizzly
it
so
much
we
have
to
do
something
or
other
of
course
her
mother
said
what
like
i
was
thinking
adams
paused
well
of
course
we
could
hardly
put
off
asking
him
to
dinner
or
something
much
alice
was
not
enthusiastic
so
far
from
it
indeed
that
there
was
a
melancholy
alarm
in
her
voice
oh
mama
must
we
do
you
think
so
yes
i
do
i
really
could
we
well
could
we
wait
it
looks
queer
adams
said
it
is
the
thing
at
all
for
a
young
man
to
come
as
much
as
he
does
and
never
more
than
just
barely
meet
your
father
and
mother
no
we
ought
to
do
but
a
dinner
alice
objected
in
the
first
place
there
is
anybody
i
want
to
ask
there
is
anybody
i
would
i
did
mean
trying
to
give
a
big
dinner
her
mother
explained
i
just
mean
having
him
to
dinner
that
mulatto
woman
malena
burns
goes
out
by
the
day
and
she
could
bring
a
waitress
we
can
get
some
flowers
for
the
table
and
some
to
put
in
the
we
might
just
as
well
go
ahead
and
do
it
as
any
other
time
because
your
father
in
a
fine
mood
and
i
saw
malena
this
afternoon
and
told
her
i
might
want
her
soon
she
said
she
did
have
any
engagements
this
week
and
i
can
let
her
know
suppose
when
he
comes
you
ask
him
for
alice
everything
be
very
nice
i
sure
do
worry
about
well
but
alice
was
uncertain
but
do
you
see
it
looks
so
queer
not
to
do
something
her
mother
urged
it
looks
so
kind
of
we
really
ought
to
wait
any
alice
assented
though
not
with
a
good
heart
very
well
i
ask
him
if
you
think
we
got
that
matter
settled
then
adams
said
i
go
telephone
malena
and
then
i
tell
your
father
about
but
when
she
went
back
to
her
husband
she
found
him
in
an
excited
state
of
mind
and
walter
standing
before
him
in
the
darkness
adams
was
almost
shouting
so
great
was
his
vehemence
hush
hush
his
wife
implored
as
she
came
near
them
they
hear
you
out
on
the
front
porch
i
do
care
who
hears
me
adams
said
harshly
though
he
tempered
his
loudness
do
you
want
to
know
what
this
boy
asking
me
for
i
thought
he
maybe
come
to
tell
me
he
got
a
little
sense
in
his
head
at
last
and
a
little
decency
about
what
due
his
family
i
thought
he
was
going
to
ask
me
to
take
him
into
my
plant
no
that
not
what
he
wants
no
it
is
walter
said
in
the
darkness
his
face
could
not
be
seen
he
stood
motionless
in
what
seemed
an
apathetic
attitude
and
he
spoke
quietly
no
he
repeated
that
is
what
i
you
stay
down
at
that
place
adams
went
on
hotly
instead
of
trying
to
be
a
little
use
to
your
family
and
the
only
reason
you
allowed
to
stay
there
is
because
lamb
never
happened
to
notice
you
are
still
there
you
just
wait
you
off
walter
said
in
the
same
quiet
way
he
knows
i
there
he
spoke
to
me
yesterday
he
asked
me
how
i
was
getting
along
with
my
he
did
adams
said
seeming
not
to
believe
him
yes
he
what
else
did
he
say
walter
adams
asked
quickly
nothin
just
walked
i
do
believe
he
knew
who
you
were
adams
declared
think
not
he
called
me
adams
at
this
adams
was
silent
and
walter
after
waiting
a
moment
said
well
are
you
going
to
do
anything
about
me
about
what
i
told
you
i
got
to
have
what
is
it
walter
his
mother
asked
since
adams
did
not
speak
walter
cleared
his
throat
and
replied
in
a
tone
as
quiet
as
that
he
had
used
before
though
with
a
slight
huskiness
i
got
to
have
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
you
better
get
him
to
give
it
to
me
if
you
adams
found
his
voice
yes
he
said
bitterly
that
all
he
asks
he
wo
do
anything
i
ask
him
to
and
in
return
he
asks
me
for
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
that
all
what
in
the
world
adams
exclaimed
what
for
walter
i
got
to
have
it
walter
said
but
what
for
his
quiet
huskiness
did
not
alter
i
got
to
have
but
ca
you
tell
us
i
got
to
have
that
all
you
can
get
out
of
him
adams
said
he
seems
to
think
it
bring
him
in
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
faint
tremulousness
became
evident
in
the
husky
voice
have
you
got
it
no
i
have
got
it
his
father
answered
and
i
got
to
go
to
a
bank
for
more
than
my
next
week
do
you
think
i
a
mint
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
walter
adams
interposed
perplexed
and
distressed
if
your
father
had
the
money
of
course
he
need
every
cent
of
it
especially
just
now
and
anyhow
you
could
scarcely
expect
him
to
give
it
to
you
unless
you
told
us
what
you
want
with
it
but
he
has
got
all
right
walter
said
and
after
standing
a
moment
more
in
silence
he
added
impersonally
i
do
see
as
you
ever
did
anything
much
for
me
anyhow
either
of
then
as
if
this
were
his
valedictory
he
turned
his
back
upon
them
walked
away
quickly
and
was
at
once
lost
to
their
sight
in
the
darkness
there
a
fine
boy
to
had
the
trouble
of
raising
adams
grumbled
just
crazy
that
what
in
the
world
do
you
suppose
he
wants
all
that
money
for
his
wife
said
wonderingly
i
ca
imagine
what
he
could
do
with
it
i
wonder
she
paused
i
wonder
if
he
if
he
what
adams
prompted
her
irritably
if
he
could
have
bad
god
knows
said
adams
do
it
just
looks
to
me
like
he
had
something
in
him
i
do
understand
you
ca
keep
your
eye
on
a
boy
all
the
time
in
a
city
this
size
not
a
boy
walter
age
you
got
a
girl
pretty
much
in
the
house
but
a
boy
follow
his
nature
do
know
what
to
do
with
him
adams
brightened
a
little
he
come
out
all
right
she
said
i
sure
he
will
i
sure
he
never
be
anything
really
bad
and
come
around
all
right
about
the
too
you
see
of
course
every
young
man
wants
money
it
does
prove
he
doing
anything
wrong
just
because
he
asks
you
for
no
all
it
proves
to
me
is
that
he
has
got
good
sense
asking
me
for
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
when
he
knows
as
well
as
you
do
the
position
i
in
if
i
wanted
to
i
could
hardly
let
him
have
three
hundred
and
fifty
cents
let
alone
dollars
i
afraid
you
have
to
let
me
have
that
much
and
maybe
a
little
more
she
ventured
timidly
and
she
told
him
of
her
plans
for
the
morrow
he
objected
vehemently
oh
but
alice
has
probably
asked
him
by
this
time
adams
said
it
really
must
be
done
virgil
you
do
want
him
to
think
ashamed
of
us
do
you
well
go
ahead
but
just
let
me
stay
away
he
begged
of
course
i
expect
to
undergo
a
kind
of
talk
with
him
when
he
gets
ready
to
say
something
to
us
about
alice
but
i
do
hate
to
have
to
sit
through
a
fashionable
why
it
is
going
to
bother
you
she
said
just
one
young
man
as
a
yes
i
know
but
you
want
to
have
all
this
fancy
cookin
and
i
see
well
enough
you
going
to
get
that
old
dress
suit
out
of
the
cedar
chest
in
the
attic
and
try
to
make
me
put
it
on
i
do
think
you
better
i
hope
the
moths
have
got
in
it
he
said
last
time
i
wore
it
was
to
the
banquet
and
it
was
pretty
old
then
of
course
i
did
mind
wearing
it
to
the
banquet
so
much
because
that
was
what
you
might
call
quite
an
he
spoke
with
some
reminiscent
complacency
the
banquet
an
affair
now
five
years
past
having
provided
the
one
time
in
his
life
when
he
had
been
so
distinguished
among
his
as
to
receive
an
invitation
to
be
present
with
some
seven
hundred
others
at
the
annual
eating
and
of
the
city
chamber
of
commerce
anyhow
as
you
say
i
think
it
would
look
foolish
of
me
to
wear
a
dress
suit
for
just
one
young
man
he
went
on
protesting
feebly
what
the
use
of
all
so
much
anyway
you
do
expect
him
to
believe
we
put
on
all
that
style
every
night
do
you
is
that
what
you
after
well
we
want
him
to
think
we
live
nicely
she
admitted
so
that
it
he
said
querulously
you
want
him
to
think
that
our
regular
gait
do
you
well
he
know
better
about
me
no
matter
how
you
fix
me
up
because
he
saw
me
in
my
regular
suit
the
evening
she
introduced
me
to
him
and
he
could
tell
anyway
i
not
one
of
these
that
always
got
a
dress
suit
on
besides
you
and
alice
certainly
have
some
idea
he
come
again
have
you
if
they
get
things
settled
between
he
be
around
the
house
and
to
meals
most
any
time
wo
he
you
do
hardly
expect
to
put
on
style
all
the
time
i
guess
well
he
see
then
that
this
kind
of
thing
was
all
and
bluff
wo
he
what
about
it
oh
well
by
that
time
she
left
the
sentence
unfinished
as
if
absently
you
could
let
us
have
a
little
money
for
you
honey
oh
i
reckon
i
reckon
he
mumbled
a
girl
like
alice
is
some
comfort
she
do
come
around
acting
as
if
she
commit
suicide
if
she
did
get
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
the
next
five
minutes
i
expect
i
can
spare
five
or
six
dollars
for
your
if
i
got
however
she
finally
obtained
fifteen
before
his
bedtime
and
the
next
morning
went
to
market
after
breakfast
leaving
alice
to
make
the
beds
walter
had
not
yet
come
downstairs
you
had
better
call
him
adams
said
as
she
departed
with
a
big
basket
on
her
arm
i
expect
he
pretty
sleepy
he
was
out
so
late
last
night
i
did
hear
him
come
in
though
i
kept
awake
till
after
midnight
listening
for
him
tell
him
he
be
late
to
work
if
he
does
hurry
and
see
that
he
drinks
his
coffee
even
if
he
has
time
for
anything
else
and
when
malena
comes
get
her
started
in
the
kitchen
show
her
where
everything
she
waved
her
hand
as
she
set
out
for
a
corner
where
the
cars
stopped
everything
be
lovely
do
forget
about
nevertheless
alice
forgot
about
walter
for
a
few
minutes
she
closed
the
door
went
into
the
absently
and
stared
vaguely
at
one
of
the
old
there
upon
her
forehead
were
the
little
shadows
of
an
apprehensive
reverie
and
her
thoughts
overlapped
one
another
in
a
fretful
jumble
what
will
he
think
these
old
chairs
they
hideous
i
scrub
those
on
the
columns
it
wo
do
any
good
though
that
long
crack
in
the
column
nothing
can
help
it
what
will
he
think
of
papa
i
hope
mama
wo
talk
too
much
when
he
thinks
of
mildred
house
or
of
henrietta
or
any
of
beside
this
she
said
she
buy
plenty
of
roses
that
ought
to
help
some
nothing
could
be
done
about
these
horrible
chairs
ca
take
up
in
the
attic
a
room
got
to
have
chairs
might
have
rented
some
no
if
he
ever
comes
again
he
see
they
were
here
he
ever
comes
again
oh
it
wo
be
that
bad
but
it
wo
be
what
he
expects
i
responsible
for
what
he
expects
he
expects
just
what
the
airs
i
put
on
have
made
him
expect
what
did
i
want
to
pose
so
to
him
for
as
if
papa
were
a
wealthy
man
and
all
that
what
will
he
think
the
photograph
of
the
colosseum
a
rather
good
thing
though
it
helps
some
as
if
we
bought
it
in
rome
perhaps
i
hope
he
think
so
he
believes
i
been
abroad
of
course
the
other
night
he
said
remember
the
feeling
you
get
in
the
there
another
lie
of
mine
not
saying
i
remember
because
i
never
been
there
what
makes
me
do
it
papa
must
wear
his
evening
clothes
but
walter
with
that
she
recalled
her
mother
admonition
and
went
upstairs
to
walter
door
she
tapped
upon
it
with
her
fingers
time
to
get
up
walter
the
rest
of
us
had
breakfast
over
half
an
hour
ago
and
it
nearly
eight
you
be
late
hurry
down
and
have
some
coffee
and
toast
ready
for
there
came
no
sound
from
within
the
room
so
she
rapped
louder
wake
up
walter
she
called
and
rapped
again
without
getting
any
response
and
then
finding
that
the
door
yielded
to
her
opened
it
and
went
in
walter
was
not
there
he
had
been
there
however
had
slept
upon
the
bed
though
not
inside
the
covers
and
alice
supposed
he
must
have
come
home
so
late
that
he
had
been
too
sleepy
to
take
off
his
clothes
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
a
shallow
closet
where
he
kept
his
other
suit
and
his
evening
clothes
and
the
door
stood
open
showing
a
bare
wall
nothing
whatever
was
in
the
closet
and
alice
was
rather
surprised
at
this
for
a
moment
that
queer
she
murmured
and
then
she
decided
that
when
he
woke
he
found
the
clothes
he
had
slept
in
so
mussy
he
had
put
on
his
other
suit
and
had
gone
out
before
breakfast
with
the
mussed
clothes
to
have
them
pressed
taking
his
evening
things
with
them
satisfied
with
this
explanation
and
failing
to
observe
that
it
did
not
account
for
the
absence
of
shoes
from
the
closet
floor
she
nodded
absently
yes
that
must
be
it
and
when
her
mother
returned
told
her
that
walter
had
probably
breakfasted
they
did
not
delay
over
this
the
coloured
woman
had
arrived
and
the
basket
disclosures
were
important
i
stopped
at
worlig
on
the
way
back
said
adams
flushed
with
hurry
and
excitement
i
bought
a
can
of
caviar
there
i
thought
have
little
sandwiches
brought
into
the
before
dinner
the
way
you
said
they
did
when
you
went
to
that
dinner
at
the
but
i
think
that
was
to
go
with
cocktails
mama
and
of
course
we
have
no
adams
said
still
i
think
it
would
be
nice
we
can
make
them
look
very
dainty
on
a
tray
and
the
waitress
can
bring
them
in
i
thought
we
have
the
soup
already
on
the
table
and
we
can
walk
right
out
as
soon
as
we
have
the
sandwiches
so
it
wo
get
cold
then
after
the
soup
malena
says
she
can
make
sweetbread
pates
with
mushrooms
and
for
the
meat
course
we
have
larded
fillet
malena
really
a
fancy
cook
you
know
and
she
says
she
can
do
anything
like
that
to
perfection
we
have
peas
with
the
fillet
and
potato
balls
and
brussels
sprouts
brussels
sprouts
are
fashionable
now
they
told
me
at
market
then
will
come
the
chicken
salad
and
after
that
the
she
going
to
make
an
cake
to
go
with
it
and
then
coffee
and
crackers
and
a
new
kind
of
cheese
i
got
at
worlig
he
says
is
very
alice
was
alarmed
do
you
think
perhaps
it
too
much
mama
it
better
to
have
too
much
than
too
little
her
mother
said
cheerfully
we
do
want
him
to
think
we
the
kind
that
skimp
lord
knows
we
have
to
enough
though
most
of
the
time
get
the
flowers
in
water
child
i
bought
at
market
because
they
so
much
cheaper
there
but
they
keep
fresh
and
nice
you
fix
any
way
you
want
hurry
it
got
to
be
a
busy
she
had
bought
three
dozen
little
roses
alice
took
them
and
began
to
arrange
them
in
vases
keeping
the
stems
separated
as
far
as
possible
so
that
the
clumps
would
look
larger
she
put
half
a
dozen
in
each
of
three
vases
in
the
placing
one
vase
on
the
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
one
at
each
end
of
the
mantelpiece
then
she
took
the
rest
of
the
roses
to
the
but
she
postponed
the
arrangement
of
them
until
the
table
should
be
set
just
before
dinner
she
was
thoughtful
planning
to
dry
the
stems
and
lay
them
on
the
tablecloth
like
a
vine
of
roses
running
in
a
delicate
design
if
she
found
that
the
dozen
and
a
half
she
had
left
were
enough
for
that
if
they
were
she
would
arrange
them
in
a
vase
she
looked
a
long
time
at
the
little
roses
in
the
basin
of
water
where
she
had
put
them
then
she
sighed
and
went
away
to
heavier
tasks
while
her
mother
worked
in
the
kitchen
with
malena
alice
dusted
the
and
the
vigorously
though
all
the
time
with
a
look
that
grew
more
and
more
pensive
and
having
dusted
everything
she
wiped
the
furniture
rubbed
it
hard
after
that
she
washed
the
floors
and
the
woodwork
emerging
from
the
kitchen
at
noon
adams
found
her
daughter
on
hands
and
knees
scrubbing
the
bases
of
the
columns
between
the
hall
and
the
now
dearie
she
said
you
must
tire
yourself
out
and
better
come
and
eat
something
your
father
said
he
get
a
bite
he
was
going
down
to
the
bank
and
walter
eats
all
the
time
lately
so
i
thought
we
would
bother
to
set
the
table
for
lunch
come
on
and
we
have
something
in
the
no
alice
said
dully
as
she
went
on
with
the
work
i
do
want
her
mother
came
closer
to
her
why
what
the
matter
she
asked
briskly
you
seem
kind
of
pale
to
me
and
you
do
look
you
look
well
alice
began
uncertainly
but
said
no
more
see
here
adams
exclaimed
this
is
all
just
for
you
you
ought
to
be
enjoying
it
why
it
the
first
time
we
we
entertained
in
i
do
know
how
long
i
guess
it
almost
since
we
had
that
little
party
when
you
were
eighteen
what
the
matter
with
you
nothing
i
do
but
dearie
are
you
looking
forward
to
this
evening
the
girl
looked
up
showing
a
pallid
and
solemn
face
oh
yes
of
course
she
said
and
tried
to
smile
of
course
we
had
to
do
it
i
do
think
it
be
nice
of
course
i
looking
forward
to
chapter
xx
she
was
indeed
looking
forward
to
that
evening
but
in
a
cloud
of
apprehension
and
although
she
could
never
have
guessed
it
this
was
the
simultaneous
condition
of
another
person
none
other
than
the
guest
for
whose
pleasure
so
much
cooking
and
scrubbing
seemed
to
be
necessary
moreover
arthur
russell
premonitions
were
no
product
of
mere
coincidence
neither
had
any
magical
sympathy
produced
them
his
state
of
mind
was
rather
the
result
of
rougher
undercurrents
which
had
all
the
time
been
running
beneath
the
surface
of
a
romantic
friendship
never
shrewder
than
when
she
analyzed
the
gentlemen
alice
did
not
libel
him
when
she
said
he
was
one
of
those
quiet
men
who
are
a
bit
flirtatious
by
which
she
meant
that
he
was
a
bit
susceptible
the
same
thing
and
he
had
proved
himself
susceptible
to
alice
upon
his
first
sight
of
her
there
he
said
to
himself
who
that
and
in
the
crowd
of
girls
at
his
cousin
dance
all
strangers
to
him
she
was
the
one
he
wanted
to
know
since
then
his
summer
evenings
with
her
had
been
as
secluded
as
if
for
three
hours
after
the
falling
of
dusk
they
two
had
drawn
apart
from
the
world
to
some
dear
bower
of
their
own
the
little
veranda
was
that
glamorous
nook
with
a
faint
golden
light
falling
through
the
glass
of
the
closed
door
upon
alice
and
darkness
elsewhere
except
for
the
one
round
globe
of
the
street
lamp
at
the
corner
the
people
who
passed
along
the
sidewalk
now
and
then
were
only
shadows
with
voices
moving
vaguely
under
the
maple
trees
that
loomed
in
obscure
contours
against
the
stars
so
as
the
two
sat
together
the
back
of
the
world
was
the
wall
and
closed
door
behind
them
and
russell
when
he
was
away
from
alice
always
thought
of
her
as
sitting
there
before
the
closed
door
a
glamour
was
about
her
thus
and
a
spell
upon
him
but
he
had
a
formless
anxiety
never
put
into
words
all
the
pictures
of
her
in
his
mind
stopped
at
the
closed
door
he
had
another
anxiety
and
for
the
greater
part
this
was
of
her
own
creating
she
had
too
often
asked
him
no
matter
how
gaily
what
he
heard
about
her
too
often
begged
him
not
to
hear
anything
then
hoping
to
forestall
whatever
he
might
hear
she
had
been
at
too
great
pains
to
account
for
it
to
discredit
and
mock
it
and
though
he
laughed
at
her
for
this
telling
her
truthfully
he
did
not
even
hear
her
mentioned
the
everlasting
irony
that
deals
with
all
such
human
forefendings
prevailed
lately
he
had
half
confessed
to
her
what
a
nervousness
she
had
produced
you
make
me
dread
the
day
when
i
hear
somebody
speaking
of
you
you
getting
me
so
upset
about
it
that
if
i
ever
hear
anybody
so
much
as
say
the
name
adams
i
run
the
confession
was
but
half
of
one
because
he
laughed
and
she
took
it
for
an
assurance
of
loyalty
in
the
form
of
burlesque
she
misunderstood
he
laughed
but
his
nervousness
was
genuine
after
any
stroke
of
events
whether
a
happy
one
or
a
catastrophe
we
see
that
the
materials
for
it
were
a
long
time
gathering
and
the
only
marvel
is
that
the
stroke
was
not
prophesied
what
bore
the
air
of
fatal
coincidence
may
remain
fatal
indeed
to
this
later
view
but
with
the
haphazard
aspect
dispelled
there
is
left
for
scrutiny
the
same
ancient
hint
from
the
infinite
to
the
effect
that
since
events
have
never
yet
failed
to
be
perhaps
it
were
well
for
us
to
deduce
that
they
will
continue
to
be
so
until
further
notice
on
the
day
that
was
to
open
the
closed
door
in
the
background
of
his
pictures
of
alice
russell
lunched
with
his
relatives
there
were
but
the
four
people
russell
and
mildred
and
her
mother
and
father
in
the
great
cool
arched
french
windows
shaded
by
awnings
admitted
a
mellow
light
and
looked
out
upon
a
green
lawn
ending
in
a
long
conservatory
which
revealed
through
its
glass
panes
a
carnival
of
plants
in
luxuriant
blossom
from
his
seat
at
the
table
russell
glanced
out
at
this
pretty
display
and
informed
his
cousins
that
he
was
surprised
you
have
such
a
glorious
spread
of
flowers
all
over
the
house
he
said
i
did
suppose
you
have
any
left
out
yonder
in
fact
i
did
know
there
were
so
many
splendid
flowers
in
the
palmer
large
calm
fair
like
her
daughter
responded
with
a
mild
reproach
that
because
you
have
been
cousinly
enough
to
get
used
to
them
arthur
you
almost
taught
us
to
forget
what
you
look
in
defense
russell
waved
a
hand
toward
her
husband
you
see
he
begun
to
keep
me
so
hard
at
work
but
palmer
declined
the
responsibility
up
to
four
or
five
in
the
afternoon
perhaps
he
said
after
that
the
young
gentleman
is
as
much
a
stranger
to
me
as
he
is
to
my
family
i
been
wondering
who
she
could
when
a
man
preoccupied
there
must
be
a
lady
then
russell
inquired
that
seems
to
be
the
view
of
your
sex
palmer
suggested
it
was
my
husband
who
said
it
not
mildred
or
mildred
smiled
faintly
papa
may
be
singular
in
his
ideas
they
may
come
entirely
from
his
own
experience
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
thank
you
mildred
her
cousin
said
bowing
to
her
gratefully
you
seem
to
understand
my
character
and
your
father
quite
as
well
however
mildred
remained
grave
in
the
face
of
this
customary
pleasantry
not
because
the
old
jest
worn
round
like
what
preceded
it
rolled
in
an
old
groove
but
because
of
some
preoccupation
of
her
own
her
faint
smile
had
disappeared
and
as
her
cousin
glance
met
hers
she
looked
down
yet
not
before
he
had
seen
in
her
eyes
the
flicker
of
something
like
a
question
a
question
both
poignant
and
dismayed
he
may
have
understood
it
for
his
own
smile
vanished
at
once
in
favour
of
a
reciprocal
solemnity
you
see
arthur
palmer
said
mildred
is
always
a
good
cousin
she
and
i
stand
by
you
even
if
you
do
stay
away
from
us
for
weeks
and
then
observing
that
he
appeared
to
be
so
occupied
with
a
bunch
of
iced
grapes
upon
his
plate
that
he
had
not
heard
her
she
began
to
talk
to
her
husband
asking
him
what
was
going
on
arthur
continued
to
eat
his
grapes
but
he
ventured
to
look
again
at
mildred
after
a
few
moments
she
also
appeared
to
be
occupied
with
a
bunch
of
grapes
though
she
ate
none
and
only
pulled
them
from
their
stems
she
sat
straight
her
features
as
composed
and
pure
as
those
of
a
new
marble
saint
in
a
cathedral
niche
yet
her
downcast
eyes
seemed
to
conceal
many
thoughts
and
her
cousin
against
his
will
was
more
aware
of
what
these
thoughts
might
be
than
of
the
leisurely
conversation
between
her
father
and
mother
all
at
once
however
he
heard
something
that
startled
him
and
he
listened
and
here
was
the
effect
of
all
alice
forefendings
he
listened
from
the
first
with
a
sinking
heart
palmer
mildly
amused
by
what
he
was
telling
his
wife
had
just
spoken
the
words
this
virgil
what
he
had
said
was
this
virgil
adams
that
the
man
name
queer
who
told
you
palmer
inquired
not
much
interested
alfred
lamb
her
husband
answered
he
was
laughing
about
his
father
at
the
club
you
see
the
old
gentleman
takes
a
great
pride
in
his
judgment
of
men
and
always
boasted
to
his
sons
that
he
never
in
his
life
made
a
mistake
in
trusting
the
wrong
man
now
alfred
and
james
albert
junior
think
they
have
a
great
joke
on
him
and
they
twitted
him
so
much
about
it
he
scarcely
speak
to
them
from
the
first
alfred
says
the
old
chap
only
repartee
was
wait
and
see
and
they
asked
him
so
often
to
show
them
what
they
going
to
see
that
he
wo
say
anything
at
all
he
a
funny
old
fellow
palmer
observed
but
he
so
shrewd
i
ca
imagine
his
being
deceived
for
such
a
long
time
twenty
years
you
said
yes
longer
than
that
i
understand
it
appears
when
this
man
this
adams
was
a
young
clerk
the
old
gentleman
trusted
him
with
one
of
his
business
secrets
a
glue
process
that
lamb
had
spent
some
money
to
get
hold
of
the
old
chap
thought
this
adams
was
going
to
have
quite
a
future
with
the
lamb
concern
and
of
course
never
dreamed
he
was
dishonest
alfred
says
this
adams
has
been
of
any
real
use
for
years
and
they
should
have
let
him
go
as
dead
wood
but
the
old
gentleman
would
hear
of
it
and
insisted
on
his
being
kept
on
the
payroll
so
they
just
decided
to
look
on
it
as
a
sort
of
pension
well
one
morning
last
march
the
man
had
an
attack
of
some
sort
down
there
and
lamb
got
his
own
car
out
and
went
home
with
him
himself
and
worried
about
him
and
went
to
see
him
no
end
all
the
time
he
was
he
would
palmer
said
approvingly
he
a
creature
that
old
her
husband
laughed
alfred
says
he
thinks
his
is
about
cured
it
seems
that
as
soon
as
the
man
got
well
again
he
deliberately
walked
off
with
the
old
gentleman
glue
secret
just
calmly
stole
it
alfred
says
he
believes
that
if
he
had
a
stroke
in
the
office
now
himself
his
father
would
lift
a
finger
to
help
him
palmer
repeated
the
name
to
herself
thoughtfully
adams
you
said
his
name
was
virgil
adams
she
looked
at
her
daughter
why
you
know
who
that
is
mildred
she
said
casually
it
that
alice
adams
father
is
it
was
his
name
virgil
adams
i
think
it
is
mildred
said
palmer
turned
toward
her
husband
you
seen
this
alice
adams
here
lamb
pet
swindler
must
be
her
palmer
passed
a
smooth
hand
over
his
neat
gray
hair
which
was
not
disturbed
by
this
effort
to
stimulate
recollection
oh
yes
he
said
of
course
certainly
quite
a
girl
one
of
friends
how
queer
mildred
looked
up
as
if
in
a
little
alarm
but
did
not
speak
her
mother
set
matters
straight
fathers
are
amusing
she
said
smilingly
to
russell
who
was
looking
at
her
though
how
fixedly
she
did
not
notice
for
she
turned
from
him
at
once
to
enlighten
her
husband
every
girl
who
meets
mildred
and
tries
to
push
the
acquaintance
by
coming
here
until
the
poor
child
has
to
hide
is
a
friend
of
hers
my
dear
mildred
eyes
were
downcast
again
and
a
faint
colour
rose
in
her
cheeks
oh
i
should
put
it
quite
that
way
about
alice
adams
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
saw
something
of
her
for
a
time
she
not
unattractive
in
a
palmer
settled
the
whole
case
of
alice
carelessly
a
pushing
sort
of
girl
she
said
a
very
pushing
little
i
mildred
began
and
after
hesitating
concluded
i
rather
dropped
fortunate
you
done
so
her
father
remarked
cheerfully
especially
since
various
members
of
the
lamb
connection
are
here
frequently
they
might
think
you
show
great
tact
in
having
her
about
the
he
laughed
and
turned
to
his
cousin
all
this
is
very
interesting
to
poor
arthur
how
terrible
people
are
with
a
newcomer
in
a
town
they
talk
as
if
he
knew
all
about
everybody
but
we
do
know
anything
about
these
queer
people
ourselves
said
palmer
we
know
something
about
the
girl
of
course
she
used
to
be
a
bit
too
conspicuous
in
fact
however
as
you
say
we
might
find
a
subject
more
interesting
for
she
smiled
whimsically
upon
the
young
man
tell
the
truth
she
said
do
you
fairly
detest
going
into
business
with
that
tyrant
yonder
what
yes
i
beg
your
pardon
he
stammered
you
were
right
palmer
said
to
her
husband
you
bored
him
so
talking
about
thievish
clerks
he
ca
even
answer
an
honest
but
russell
was
beginning
to
recover
his
outward
composure
try
me
again
he
said
i
afraid
i
was
thinking
of
something
this
was
the
best
he
found
to
say
there
was
a
part
of
him
that
wanted
to
protest
and
deny
but
he
had
not
heat
enough
in
the
chill
that
had
come
upon
him
here
was
the
first
mention
of
alice
and
with
it
the
reason
why
it
was
the
first
palmer
had
difficulty
in
recalling
her
and
she
happened
to
be
spoken
of
only
because
her
father
betrayal
of
a
benefactor
trust
had
been
so
peculiarly
atrocious
that
in
the
view
of
the
benefactor
family
it
contained
enough
of
the
element
of
humour
to
warrant
a
mild
laugh
at
a
club
there
was
the
deadliness
of
the
story
its
lack
of
malice
even
of
resentment
deadlier
still
were
palmer
phrases
a
pushing
sort
of
girl
a
very
pushing
little
person
and
used
to
be
a
bit
too
conspicuous
in
but
she
spoke
placidly
and
by
chance
being
as
obviously
without
unkindly
motive
as
palmer
was
when
he
related
the
cause
of
alfred
lamb
amusement
her
opinion
of
the
obscure
young
lady
momentarily
her
topic
had
been
expressed
moreover
to
her
husband
and
at
her
own
table
she
sat
there
large
kind
serene
a
protest
might
astonish
but
could
not
change
her
and
russell
crumpling
in
his
strained
fingers
the
little
web
of
a
napkin
on
his
knee
found
heart
enough
to
grow
red
but
not
enough
to
challenge
her
she
noticed
his
colour
and
attributed
it
to
the
embarrassment
of
a
scrupulously
gallant
gentleman
caught
in
a
lapse
of
attention
to
a
lady
do
be
disturbed
she
said
benevolently
people
are
expected
to
listen
all
the
time
to
their
relatives
a
high
colour
very
becoming
to
you
arthur
but
it
really
is
necessary
between
cousins
you
can
always
be
informal
enough
with
us
to
listen
only
when
you
care
his
complexion
continued
to
be
ruddier
than
usual
however
throughout
the
meal
and
was
still
somewhat
tinted
when
palmer
rose
the
man
bringing
you
cigarettes
here
she
said
nodding
to
the
two
gentlemen
we
give
you
a
chance
to
do
the
sordid
kind
of
talking
we
know
you
really
like
afterwhile
mildred
will
show
you
what
in
bloom
in
the
hothouse
if
you
wish
mildred
followed
her
and
when
they
were
alone
in
another
of
the
spacious
rooms
went
to
a
window
and
looked
out
while
her
mother
seated
herself
near
the
center
of
the
room
in
a
gilt
armchair
mellowed
with
old
aubusson
tapestry
palmer
looked
thoughtfully
at
her
back
but
did
not
speak
to
her
until
coffee
had
been
brought
for
them
thanks
mildred
said
not
turning
i
do
care
for
any
coffee
i
no
palmer
said
gently
i
afraid
our
cousin
wo
think
you
very
talkative
mildred
you
spoke
only
about
twice
at
lunch
i
should
care
for
him
to
get
the
idea
you
piqued
because
he
come
here
so
little
lately
should
you
no
i
should
mildred
answered
in
a
low
voice
and
with
that
she
turned
quickly
and
came
to
sit
near
her
mother
but
it
what
i
am
afraid
of
mama
did
you
notice
how
red
he
got
you
mean
when
he
was
caught
not
listening
to
a
question
of
mine
yes
it
very
becoming
to
mama
i
do
think
that
was
the
reason
i
do
think
it
was
because
he
was
listening
i
no
i
think
his
colour
and
his
not
listening
came
from
the
same
reason
mildred
said
and
although
she
had
come
to
sit
near
her
mother
she
did
not
look
at
her
i
think
it
happened
because
you
and
papa
she
stopped
yes
palmer
said
to
prompt
her
your
father
and
i
did
something
embarrassing
mama
it
was
because
of
those
things
that
came
out
about
alice
how
could
that
bother
arthur
does
he
know
her
do
you
remember
the
daughter
asked
the
day
after
my
dance
i
mentioned
how
odd
i
thought
it
was
in
him
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
him
i
been
seeing
that
he
met
everybody
of
course
but
she
was
the
only
girl
he
asked
to
meet
and
he
did
it
as
soon
as
he
noticed
her
i
had
meant
to
have
him
meet
her
in
fact
i
was
rather
sorry
felt
i
had
to
ask
her
because
she
oh
well
she
the
sort
that
for
the
new
man
if
she
has
half
a
chance
and
sometimes
they
seem
quite
fascinated
for
a
time
that
is
i
thought
arthur
was
above
all
that
or
at
the
very
least
i
gave
him
credit
for
being
too
i
see
palmer
said
thoughtfully
i
remember
now
that
you
spoke
of
it
you
said
it
seemed
a
little
peculiar
but
of
course
it
really
was
a
man
has
nothing
to
go
by
except
his
own
first
impressions
you
ca
blame
poor
arthur
she
quite
a
piquant
looking
little
person
you
think
he
seen
something
of
her
since
then
mildred
nodded
slowly
i
never
dreamed
such
a
thing
till
yesterday
and
even
then
i
rather
doubted
it
till
he
got
so
red
just
now
i
was
surprised
when
he
asked
to
meet
her
but
he
just
danced
with
her
once
and
did
mention
her
afterward
i
forgot
all
about
it
in
fact
i
virtually
forgot
all
about
her
i
seen
quite
a
little
of
her
yes
said
palmer
she
did
keep
coming
here
but
i
just
about
decided
that
it
really
would
do
mildred
went
on
she
is
well
i
did
admire
no
her
mother
assented
and
evidently
followed
a
direct
connection
of
thought
in
a
speech
apparently
irrelevant
i
understand
the
young
malone
wants
to
marry
henrietta
i
hope
she
wo
he
seems
rather
a
gross
type
of
oh
he
just
one
mildred
said
i
do
know
that
he
and
alice
adams
were
ever
engaged
she
never
told
me
so
she
may
not
have
been
engaged
to
any
of
them
she
was
just
enough
among
the
other
girls
to
get
talked
about
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
felt
a
little
inclined
to
be
nice
to
her
was
that
they
seemed
to
be
rather
edging
her
out
of
the
circle
it
was
long
before
i
saw
they
were
right
though
i
happened
to
mention
i
was
going
to
give
a
dance
and
she
pretended
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
i
meant
to
invite
her
brother
at
least
i
thought
she
pretended
she
may
have
really
believed
it
at
any
rate
i
had
to
send
him
a
card
but
i
did
intend
to
be
let
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
again
of
course
she
what
you
said
though
i
awfully
sorry
you
said
why
should
i
have
said
it
my
dear
of
course
i
did
say
mildred
explained
gravely
i
meant
only
that
i
sorry
it
yes
but
why
mama
mildred
turned
to
her
leaning
forward
and
speaking
in
a
lowered
voice
mama
at
first
the
change
was
so
little
it
seemed
as
if
arthur
hardly
knew
it
himself
he
been
lovely
to
me
always
and
he
was
still
lovely
to
me
but
oh
well
you
understood
after
my
dance
it
was
more
as
if
it
was
just
his
nature
and
his
training
to
be
lovely
to
me
as
he
would
be
to
everyone
a
kind
of
politeness
he
never
said
he
cared
for
me
but
after
that
i
could
see
he
did
it
was
clear
after
that
i
did
know
what
had
happened
i
could
think
of
anything
done
mama
it
was
alice
palmer
set
her
little
upon
the
table
beside
her
calmly
following
her
own
motion
with
her
eyes
and
not
seeming
to
realize
with
what
serious
entreaty
her
daughter
gaze
was
fixed
upon
her
mildred
repeated
the
last
sentence
of
her
revelation
and
introduced
a
stress
of
insistence
mama
it
was
alice
adams
but
palmer
declined
to
be
greatly
impressed
so
far
as
her
appearance
went
at
least
and
to
emphasize
her
refusal
she
smiled
indulgently
what
makes
you
think
so
henrietta
told
me
at
this
palmer
permitted
herself
to
laugh
softly
aloud
good
heavens
is
henrietta
a
soothsayer
or
is
she
arthur
particular
confidante
no
ella
dowling
told
palmer
laughter
continued
now
we
have
it
she
exclaimed
a
game
of
gossip
arthur
tells
ella
ella
tells
henrietta
and
henrietta
tells
do
laugh
please
mama
mildred
begged
of
course
arthur
tell
anybody
it
roundabout
enough
but
it
true
i
know
it
i
had
quite
believed
it
but
i
knew
it
was
true
when
he
got
so
red
he
looked
oh
for
a
second
or
so
he
looked
stricken
he
thought
i
notice
it
mama
he
been
to
see
her
almost
every
evening
lately
they
take
long
walks
together
that
why
he
has
been
of
palmer
laughter
there
was
left
only
her
indulgent
smile
which
she
had
not
allowed
to
vanish
well
what
of
it
she
said
mama
yes
said
palmer
what
of
it
but
do
you
see
mildred
voice
though
modulated
and
repressed
even
in
her
present
emotion
nevertheless
had
a
tendency
to
quaver
it
true
frank
dowling
was
going
to
see
her
one
evening
and
he
saw
arthur
sitting
on
the
stoop
with
her
and
did
go
in
and
ella
used
to
go
to
school
with
a
girl
who
lives
across
the
street
from
here
she
told
ella
oh
i
understand
palmer
interrupted
suppose
he
does
go
there
my
dear
i
said
of
it
i
do
see
what
you
mean
mama
i
so
afraid
he
might
think
we
knew
about
it
and
that
you
and
papa
said
those
things
about
her
and
her
father
on
that
account
as
if
we
abused
them
because
he
goes
there
instead
of
coming
nonsense
palmer
rose
went
to
a
window
and
turning
there
stood
with
her
back
to
it
facing
her
daughter
and
looking
at
her
cheerfully
nonsense
my
dear
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
she
was
mentioned
by
accident
and
so
was
her
father
what
an
extraordinary
man
if
arthur
makes
friends
with
people
like
that
he
certainly
knows
better
than
to
expect
to
hear
favourable
opinions
of
them
besides
it
only
a
little
passing
thing
with
mama
when
he
goes
there
almost
every
yes
palmer
said
dryly
it
seems
to
me
i
heard
somewhere
that
other
young
men
have
gone
there
every
she
last
apparently
arthur
gallant
and
he
impressionable
but
he
fastidious
and
fastidiousness
is
always
the
check
on
impressionableness
a
girl
belongs
to
her
family
too
and
this
one
does
especially
it
strikes
me
arthur
very
sensible
he
sees
more
than
you
mildred
looked
at
her
hopefully
then
you
do
believe
he
likely
to
imagine
we
said
those
things
of
her
in
any
meaning
way
at
this
palmer
laughed
again
there
one
thing
you
seem
not
to
have
noticed
what
that
it
seems
to
have
escaped
your
attention
that
he
never
said
a
might
that
mean
mildred
began
but
she
stopped
no
it
might
her
mother
replied
comprehending
easily
on
the
contrary
it
might
mean
that
instead
of
his
feeling
it
too
deeply
to
speak
he
was
getting
a
little
mildred
rose
and
came
to
her
why
do
you
suppose
he
never
told
us
he
went
there
do
you
think
he
do
you
think
he
pleased
with
her
and
yet
ashamed
of
it
why
do
you
suppose
he
never
spoken
of
it
ah
that
palmer
said
that
might
possibly
be
her
own
doing
if
it
is
she
well
paid
by
what
your
father
and
i
said
because
we
would
have
said
it
if
we
known
that
arthur
she
checked
herself
quickly
looking
over
her
daughter
shoulder
she
saw
the
two
gentlemen
coming
from
the
corridor
toward
the
wide
doorway
of
the
room
and
she
greeted
them
cheerfully
if
you
finished
with
each
other
for
a
while
she
added
arthur
may
find
it
a
relief
to
put
his
thoughts
on
something
prettier
than
a
trust
company
and
more
arthur
came
to
mildred
your
mother
said
at
lunch
that
perhaps
you
i
did
say
arthur
palmer
interrupted
to
correct
him
i
said
she
would
if
you
care
to
see
and
smell
those
lovely
things
out
yonder
she
show
them
to
you
run
along
children
half
an
hour
later
glancing
from
a
window
she
saw
them
come
from
the
hothouses
and
slowly
cross
the
lawn
arthur
had
a
fine
rose
in
his
buttonhole
and
looked
profoundly
thoughtful
chapter
xxi
that
morning
and
noon
had
been
warm
though
the
stirrings
of
a
feeble
breeze
made
weather
not
flagrantly
intemperate
but
at
about
three
in
the
afternoon
there
came
out
of
the
southwest
a
heat
like
an
affliction
sent
upon
an
accursed
people
and
the
air
was
soon
dead
of
it
dripping
negro
whooped
with
satires
praising
hell
and
hot
weather
as
the
tossing
shovels
flickered
up
to
the
street
level
where
sluggish
male
pedestrians
carried
coats
upon
hot
arms
and
fanned
themselves
with
straw
hats
or
remaining
covered
wore
soaked
handkerchiefs
between
scalp
and
straw
clerks
drooped
in
silent
big
department
stores
stenographers
in
offices
kept
as
close
to
electric
fans
as
the
intervening
bulk
of
their
employers
would
let
them
guests
in
hotels
left
the
lobbies
and
went
to
lie
unclad
upon
their
beds
while
in
hospitals
the
patients
murmured
querulously
against
the
heat
and
perhaps
against
some
noisy
motorist
who
strove
to
feel
the
air
by
splitting
it
not
troubled
by
any
foreboding
that
he
too
that
hour
next
week
might
need
quiet
near
a
hospital
the
hot
spell
was
a
true
spell
one
upon
men
spirits
for
it
was
so
hot
that
in
suburban
outskirts
golfers
crept
slowly
back
over
the
low
undulations
of
their
club
lands
abandoning
their
matches
and
returning
to
shelter
even
on
such
a
day
sizzling
work
had
to
be
done
as
in
winter
there
were
glowing
furnaces
to
be
stoked
liquid
metals
to
be
poured
but
such
tasks
found
seasoned
men
standing
to
them
and
in
all
the
city
probably
no
brave
soul
challenged
the
heat
more
gamely
than
adams
did
when
in
a
corner
of
her
small
and
fiery
kitchen
where
all
day
long
her
hired
african
immune
cooked
fiercely
she
pressed
her
husband
evening
clothes
with
a
hot
iron
no
doubt
she
risked
her
life
but
she
risked
it
cheerfully
in
so
good
and
necessary
a
service
for
him
she
would
have
given
her
life
for
him
at
any
time
and
both
his
and
her
own
for
her
children
unconscious
of
her
own
heroism
she
was
surprised
to
find
herself
rather
faint
when
she
finished
her
ironing
however
she
took
heart
to
believe
that
the
clothes
looked
better
in
spite
of
one
or
two
scorched
places
and
she
carried
them
upstairs
to
her
husband
room
before
increasing
blindness
forced
her
to
grope
for
the
nearest
chair
then
trying
to
rise
and
walk
without
having
sufficiently
recovered
she
had
to
sit
down
again
but
after
a
little
while
she
was
able
to
get
upon
her
feet
and
keeping
her
hand
against
the
wall
moved
successfully
to
the
door
of
her
own
room
here
she
wavered
might
have
gone
down
had
she
not
been
stimulated
by
the
thought
of
how
much
depended
upon
her
she
made
a
final
great
effort
and
floundered
across
the
room
to
her
bureau
where
she
kept
some
simple
restoratives
they
served
her
need
or
her
faith
in
them
did
and
she
returned
to
her
work
she
went
down
the
stairs
keeping
a
still
tremulous
hand
upon
the
rail
but
she
smiled
brightly
when
alice
looked
up
from
below
where
the
woodwork
was
again
being
tormented
with
superfluous
attentions
alice
do
her
mother
said
commiseratingly
you
did
all
that
this
morning
and
it
looks
lovely
what
the
use
of
wearing
yourself
out
on
it
you
ought
to
be
lying
down
so
to
look
fresh
for
had
you
better
lie
down
yourself
the
daughter
returned
are
you
ill
mama
certainly
not
what
in
the
world
makes
you
think
so
you
look
pretty
pale
alice
said
and
sighed
heavily
it
makes
me
ashamed
having
you
work
so
hard
for
how
foolish
i
think
it
fun
getting
ready
to
entertain
a
little
again
like
this
i
only
wish
it
had
turned
so
hot
i
afraid
your
poor
father
suffer
his
things
are
pretty
heavy
i
noticed
well
it
do
him
good
to
bear
something
for
style
sake
this
once
anyhow
she
laughed
and
coming
to
alice
bent
down
and
kissed
her
dearie
she
said
tenderly
would
you
please
slip
upstairs
now
and
take
just
a
little
teeny
nap
to
please
your
mother
but
alice
responded
only
by
moving
her
head
slowly
in
token
of
refusal
do
adams
urged
you
do
want
to
look
worn
out
do
you
i
look
all
right
alice
said
huskily
do
you
like
the
way
arranged
the
furniture
now
i
tried
all
the
different
ways
it
it
lovely
her
mother
said
admiringly
i
thought
the
last
way
you
had
it
was
pretty
too
but
you
know
best
i
never
knew
anybody
with
so
much
taste
if
you
only
just
quit
now
and
take
a
little
rest
there
hardly
be
time
even
if
i
wanted
to
it
after
five
but
i
could
really
i
could
how
do
you
think
we
can
manage
about
walter
to
see
that
he
wears
his
evening
things
i
mean
adams
pondered
i
afraid
he
make
a
lot
of
objections
on
account
of
the
weather
and
everything
i
wish
we
had
a
chance
to
tell
him
last
night
or
this
morning
i
have
telephoned
to
him
this
afternoon
except
well
i
scarcely
like
to
call
him
up
at
that
place
since
your
father
no
of
course
not
if
walter
gets
home
late
adams
went
on
i
just
slip
out
and
speak
to
him
in
case
russell
here
before
he
comes
i
just
tell
him
he
got
to
hurry
and
get
his
things
maybe
he
wo
come
home
to
dinner
alice
suggested
rather
hopefully
sometimes
he
no
i
think
he
be
here
when
he
does
come
he
usually
telephones
by
this
time
to
say
not
to
wait
for
him
he
very
thoughtful
about
that
well
it
really
is
getting
late
i
must
go
and
tell
her
she
ought
to
be
preparing
her
fillet
dearie
do
rest
a
you
much
better
do
that
yourself
alice
called
after
her
but
adams
shook
her
head
cheerily
not
pausing
on
her
way
to
the
fiery
kitchen
alice
continued
her
useless
labours
for
a
time
then
carried
her
bucket
to
the
head
of
the
cellar
stairway
where
she
left
it
upon
the
top
step
and
closing
the
door
returned
to
the
again
she
changed
the
positions
of
the
old
plush
moving
them
into
the
corners
where
she
thought
they
might
be
least
noticeable
and
while
thus
engaged
she
was
startled
by
a
loud
ringing
of
the
for
a
moment
her
face
was
and
she
stood
staring
then
she
realized
that
russell
would
not
arrive
for
another
hour
at
the
earliest
and
recovering
her
equipoise
went
to
the
door
waiting
there
in
a
languid
attitude
was
a
young
coloured
woman
with
a
small
bundle
under
her
arm
and
something
malleable
in
her
mouth
listen
she
said
you
folks
expectin
a
coloured
lady
no
said
alice
especially
not
at
the
front
listen
the
coloured
woman
said
again
listen
say
listen
they
another
coloured
lady
awready
here
by
the
day
listen
ai
miz
malena
burns
here
by
the
day
this
evenin
say
listen
this
the
number
house
she
give
are
you
the
waitress
alice
asked
dismally
yes
if
malena
malena
is
here
alice
said
and
hesitated
but
she
decided
not
to
send
the
waitress
to
the
back
door
it
might
be
a
risk
she
let
her
in
what
your
name
me
i
name
gertrude
miss
gertrude
did
you
bring
a
cap
and
apron
gertrude
took
the
little
bundle
from
under
her
arm
yes
i
all
i
already
set
the
table
alice
said
i
show
you
what
we
want
she
led
the
way
to
the
and
after
offering
some
instruction
there
received
by
gertrude
with
languor
and
a
slowly
moving
jaw
she
took
her
into
the
kitchen
where
the
cap
and
apron
were
put
on
the
effect
was
not
fortunate
gertrude
eyes
were
noticeably
bloodshot
an
affliction
made
more
apparent
by
the
white
cap
and
alice
drew
her
mother
apart
whispering
anxiously
do
you
suppose
it
too
late
to
get
someone
else
i
afraid
it
is
adams
said
malena
says
it
was
hard
enough
to
get
her
you
have
to
pay
them
so
much
that
they
only
work
when
they
feel
like
mama
could
you
ask
her
to
wear
her
cap
straighter
every
time
she
moves
her
head
she
gets
it
on
one
side
and
her
skirt
too
long
behind
and
too
short
in
front
and
oh
i
never
seen
such
feet
alice
laughed
desolately
and
she
must
quit
that
terrible
chewing
never
mind
i
get
to
work
with
her
i
straighten
her
out
all
i
can
dearie
do
adams
patted
her
daughter
shoulder
encouragingly
now
you
ca
do
another
thing
and
if
you
do
run
and
begin
dressing
you
wo
be
ready
it
only
take
me
a
minute
to
dress
myself
and
i
be
down
long
before
you
will
run
darling
i
look
after
alice
nodded
vaguely
went
up
to
her
room
and
after
only
a
moment
with
her
mirror
brought
from
her
closet
the
dress
of
white
organdie
she
had
worn
the
night
when
she
met
russell
for
the
first
time
she
laid
it
carefully
upon
her
bed
and
began
to
make
ready
to
put
it
on
her
mother
came
in
half
an
hour
later
to
fasten
her
i
all
dressed
adams
said
briskly
of
course
it
matter
he
wo
know
what
the
rest
of
us
even
look
like
how
could
he
i
know
i
an
old
sight
but
all
i
want
is
to
look
respectable
do
i
you
look
like
the
best
woman
in
the
world
that
all
alice
said
with
a
little
gulp
her
mother
laughed
and
gave
her
a
final
scrutiny
you
might
use
just
a
tiny
bit
more
colour
dearie
i
afraid
the
excitement
made
you
a
little
pale
and
you
must
brighten
up
there
sort
of
a
look
in
your
eyes
as
if
you
got
in
a
trance
and
could
get
out
you
had
it
all
day
i
must
run
your
father
wants
me
to
help
him
with
his
studs
walter
has
come
yet
but
i
look
after
him
do
worry
and
you
better
hurry
dearie
if
you
going
to
take
any
time
fixing
the
flowers
on
the
she
departed
while
alice
sat
at
the
mirror
again
to
follow
her
advice
concerning
a
tiny
bit
more
before
she
had
finished
her
father
knocked
at
the
door
and
when
she
responded
came
in
he
was
dressed
in
the
clothes
his
wife
had
pressed
but
he
had
lost
substantially
in
weight
since
they
were
made
for
him
no
one
would
have
thought
that
they
had
been
pressed
they
hung
from
him
voluminously
seeming
to
be
the
clothes
of
a
larger
man
your
mother
gone
downstairs
he
said
in
a
voice
of
distress
one
of
the
buttonholes
in
my
shirt
is
too
large
and
i
ca
keep
the
dang
thing
fastened
do
know
what
to
do
about
it
i
only
got
one
other
white
shirt
and
it
kind
of
ruined
i
tried
it
before
i
did
this
one
do
you
you
could
do
anything
i
see
she
said
my
collar
got
a
frayed
edge
he
complained
as
she
examined
his
troublesome
shirt
it
a
good
deal
like
wearing
a
saw
but
i
expect
it
wilt
down
flat
pretty
soon
and
not
bother
me
long
i
liable
to
wilt
down
flat
myself
i
expect
i
do
know
as
i
remember
any
such
hot
night
in
the
last
ten
or
twelve
he
lifted
his
head
and
sniffed
the
flaccid
air
which
was
laden
with
a
heavy
odour
my
but
that
smell
is
pretty
strong
he
said
stand
still
please
papa
alice
begged
him
i
ca
see
what
the
matter
if
you
move
around
how
absurd
you
are
about
your
old
glue
smell
papa
there
is
a
vestige
of
it
of
i
did
mean
glue
he
informed
her
i
mean

that
fashionable
now
to
have
cabbage
when
there
company
for
dinner
that
is
cabbage
papa
it
brussels
oh
is
it
i
do
mind
it
much
because
it
keeps
that
glue
smell
off
me
but
it
fairly
strong
i
expect
you
do
notice
it
so
much
because
you
been
in
the
house
with
it
all
along
and
got
used
to
it
while
it
was
it
is
pretty
dreadful
alice
said
are
all
the
windows
open
downstairs
i
go
down
and
see
if
you
just
fix
that
hole
up
for
i
afraid

ca
she
said

unless
you
take
your
shirt
off
and
bring
it
to
me
i
have
to
sew
the
hole
oh
well
i
go
ask
your
mother
to
no
said
alice
she
got
everything
on
her
hands
run
and
take
it
off
hurry
papa
i
got
to
arrange
the
flowers
on
the
table
before
he
he
went
away
and
came
back
presently
half
undressed
bringing
the
shirt
there
one
comfort
he
remarked
pensively
as
she
worked
i
got
that
collar
off
for
a
while
anyway
i
wish
i
could
go
to
table
like
this
i
could
stand
it
a
good
deal
better
do
you
seem
to
be
making
any
headway
with
the
dang
thing
i
think
probably
i
can
downstairs
the
rang
and
alice
arms
jerked
with
the
shock
golly
her
father
said
did
you
stick
your
finger
with
that
fool
needle
she
gave
him
a
blank
stare
he
come
she
was
not
mistaken
for
upon
the
little
veranda
russell
stood
facing
the
closed
door
at
last
however
it
remained
closed
for
a
considerable
time
after
he
rang
inside
the
house
the
warning
summons
of
the
bell
was
immediately
followed
by
another
sound
audible
to
alice
and
her
father
as
a
crash
preceding
a
series
of
muffled
falls
then
came
a
distant
voice
bitter
in
complaint
oh
lord
said
adams
what
that
alice
went
to
the
top
of
the
front
stairs
and
her
mother
appeared
in
the
hall
below
mama
adams
looked
up
it
all
right
she
said
in
a
loud
whisper
gertrude
fell
down
the
cellar
stairs
somebody
left
a
bucket
there
and
she
was
interrupted
by
a
gasp
from
alice
and
hastened
to
reassure
her
do
worry
dearie
she
may
limp
a
little
but
adams
leaned
over
the
banisters
did
she
break
anything
he
asked
hush
his
wife
whispered
no
she
seems
upset
and
angry
about
it
more
than
anything
else
but
she
rubbing
herself
and
she
be
all
right
in
time
to
bring
in
the
little
sandwiches
alice
those
flowers
i
know
mama
but
hurry
adams
warned
her
both
of
you
hurry
i
must
let
him
in
she
turned
to
the
door
smiling
cordially
even
before
she
opened
it
do
come
right
in
russell
she
said
loudly
lifting
her
voice
for
additional
warning
to
those
above
i
so
glad
to
receive
you
informally
this
way
in
our
own
little
home
there
a
here
under
the
stairway
she
continued
as
russell
murmuring
some
response
came
into
the
hall
i
afraid
you
think
it
almost
too
informal
my
coming
to
the
door
but
unfortunately
our
housemaid
just
had
a
little
accident
oh
nothing
to
mention
i
just
thought
we
better
not
keep
you
waiting
any
longer
will
you
step
into
our
please
she
led
the
way
between
the
two
small
columns
and
seated
herself
in
one
of
the
plush
selecting
it
because
alice
had
once
pointed
out
that
the
chairs
themselves
were
less
noticeable
when
they
had
people
sitting
in
them
do
sit
down
russell
it
so
very
warm
it
really
quite
a
trial
just
to
stand
up
thank
you
he
said
as
he
took
a
seat
yes
it
is
quite
and
this
seemed
to
be
the
extent
of
his
responsiveness
for
the
moment
he
was
grave
rather
pale
and
adams
impression
of
him
as
she
formed
it
then
was
of
a
young
man
really
elegant
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
but
timid
and
formal
when
he
first
meets
she
beamed
upon
him
and
used
with
everything
she
said
a
continuous
accompaniment
of
laughter
meaningless
except
that
it
was
meant
to
convey
cordiality
of
course
we
do
have
a
great
deal
of
warm
weather
she
informed
him
i
glad
it
so
much
cooler
in
the
house
than
it
is
yes
he
said
it
is
pleasanter
and
stopping
with
this
single
untruth
he
permitted
himself
the
briefest
glance
about
the
room
then
his
eyes
returned
to
his
smiling
hostess
most
people
make
a
great
fuss
about
hot
weather
she
said
the
only
person
i
know
who
does
mind
the
heat
the
way
other
people
do
is
alice
she
always
seems
as
cool
as
if
we
had
a
breeze
blowing
no
matter
how
hot
it
is
but
then
she
so
amiable
she
never
minds
anything
just
her
character
she
always
been
that
way
since
she
was
a
little
child
always
the
same
to
everybody
high
and
low
i
think
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
after
all
do
you
russell
yes
he
said
solemnly
and
touched
his
bedewed
white
forehead
with
a
handkerchief
indeed
it
is
she
agreed
with
herself
never
failing
to
continue
her
murmur
of
laughter
that
what
i
always
told
alice
but
she
never
sees
anything
good
in
herself
and
she
just
laughs
at
me
when
i
praise
her
she
sees
good
in
everybody
else
in
the
world
no
matter
how
unworthy
they
are
or
how
they
behave
toward
her
but
she
always
underestimates
herself
from
the
time
she
was
a
little
child
she
was
always
that
way
when
some
other
little
girl
would
behave
selfishly
or
meanly
toward
her
do
you
think
she
come
and
tell
me
never
a
word
to
anybody
the
little
thing
was
too
proud
she
was
the
same
way
about
school
the
teachers
had
to
tell
me
when
she
took
a
prize
she
bring
it
home
and
keep
it
in
her
room
without
a
word
about
it
to
her
father
and
mother
now
walter
was
just
the
other
way
walter
would
but
here
adams
checked
herself
though
she
increased
the
volume
of
her
laughter
how
silly
of
me
she
exclaimed
i
expect
you
know
how
mothers
are
though
russell
give
us
a
chance
and
we
talk
about
our
children
forever
alice
would
feel
terribly
if
she
knew
how
been
going
on
about
her
to
in
this
adams
was
right
though
she
did
not
herself
suspect
it
and
upon
an
almost
inaudible
word
or
two
from
him
she
went
on
with
her
topic
of
course
my
excuse
is
that
few
mothers
have
a
daughter
like
alice
i
suppose
we
all
think
the
same
way
about
our
children
but
some
of
us
must
be
right
when
we
feel
we
got
the
best
do
you
think
so
yes
yes
i
sure
am
she
laughed
i
let
the
others
speak
for
she
paused
reflectively
no
i
think
a
mother
knows
when
she
got
a
treasure
in
her
family
if
she
has
got
one
pretend
she
has
maybe
but
if
she
has
she
knows
it
i
certainly
know
have
she
always
been
what
people
call
joy
of
the
household
always
cheerful
no
matter
what
went
wrong
and
always
ready
to
smooth
things
over
with
some
bright
witty
saying
you
must
be
sure
not
to
tell
we
had
this
little
chat
about
her
she
just
be
furious
with
me
but
she
is
such
a
dear
child
you
wo
tell
her
will
you
no
he
said
and
again
applied
the
handkerchief
to
his
forehead
for
an
instant
no
i
he
paused
and
finished
lamely
i
not
tell
thus
reassured
adams
set
before
him
some
details
of
her
popularity
at
sixteen
dwelling
upon
alice
impartiality
among
her
young
suitors
she
never
could
bear
to
hurt
their
feelings
and
always
treated
all
of
them
just
alike
about
half
a
dozen
of
them
were
just
bound
to
marry
her
naturally
her
father
and
i
considered
any
such
idea
ridiculous
she
was
too
young
of
thus
the
mother
went
on
with
her
biographical
sketches
while
the
pale
young
man
sat
facing
her
under
the
hard
overhead
light
of
a
white
globe
set
to
the
ceiling
and
listened
without
interrupting
she
was
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
tell
him
a
few
things
about
alice
he
might
not
have
guessed
for
himself
and
indeed
she
had
planned
to
find
such
an
opportunity
if
she
could
but
this
was
getting
to
be
altogether
too
much
of
one
she
felt
as
time
passed
she
was
like
an
actor
who
must
improvise
to
keep
the
audience
from
perceiving
that
his
have
missed
their
cues
but
her
anxiety
was
not
betrayed
to
the
still
listener
she
had
a
valiant
soul
alice
meanwhile
had
arranged
her
little
roses
on
the
table
in
as
many
ways
probably
as
there
were
blossoms
and
she
was
still
at
it
when
her
father
arrived
in
the
by
way
of
the
back
stairs
and
the
kitchen
it
pulled
out
again
he
said
but
i
guess
there
no
help
for
it
now
it
too
late
and
anyway
it
lets
some
air
into
me
when
it
bulges
i
can
sit
so
it
wo
be
noticed
much
i
expect
is
it
time
you
quit
bothering
about
the
looks
of
the
table
your
mother
been
talking
to
him
about
half
an
hour
now
and
i
had
the
idea
he
came
on
your
account
not
hers
had
you
better
go
and
just
a
alice
said
piteously
do
you
think
it
looks
all
right
the
flowers
fine
had
you
better
leave
the
way
they
are
though
just
a
minute
she
begged
again
just
one
minute
papa
and
she
exchanged
a
rose
in
front
of
russell
plate
for
one
that
seemed
to
her
a
little
larger
you
better
come
on
adams
said
moving
to
the
door
just
one
more
second
she
shook
her
head
lamenting
oh
i
wish
we
rented
some
silver
why
because
so
much
of
the
plating
has
rubbed
off
a
lot
of
it
just
a
second
and
as
she
spoke
she
hastily
went
round
the
table
gathering
the
knives
and
forks
and
spoons
that
she
thought
had
their
plating
best
preserved
and
exchanging
them
for
more
damaged
pieces
at
russell
place
there
she
sighed
finally
now
i
but
at
the
door
she
paused
to
look
back
dubiously
over
her
shoulder
what
the
matter
now
the
roses
i
believe
after
all
i
should
have
tried
that
vine
effect
i
ought
to
have
kept
them
in
water
in
the
vase
it
so
hot
they
already
begin
to
look
a
little
wilted
out
on
the
dry
tablecloth
like
that
i
believe
i
why
look
here
alice
he
remonstrated
as
she
seemed
disposed
to
turn
back
everything
burn
up
on
the
stove
if
you
keep
on
oh
well
she
said
the
vase
was
terribly
ugly
i
ca
do
any
better
we
go
but
with
her
hand
on
the
she
paused
no
papa
we
must
go
in
by
this
door
it
might
look
as
if
as
if
what
never
mind
she
said
let
go
the
other
i
do
see
what
difference
it
makes
he
grumbled
but
nevertheless
followed
her
through
the
kitchen
and
up
the
back
stairs
then
through
the
upper
hallway
at
the
top
of
the
front
stairs
she
paused
for
a
moment
drawing
a
deep
breath
and
then
before
her
father
puzzled
eyes
a
transformation
came
upon
her
her
shoulders
like
her
eyelids
had
been
drooping
but
now
she
threw
her
head
back
the
shoulders
straightened
and
the
lashes
lifted
over
sparkling
eyes
vivacity
came
to
her
whole
body
in
a
flash
and
she
tripped
down
the
steps
with
her
pretty
hands
rising
in
time
to
the
lilting
little
tune
she
had
begun
to
hum
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
one
of
those
pretty
hands
extended
itself
at
full
arm
length
toward
russell
and
continued
to
be
extended
until
it
reached
his
own
hand
as
he
came
to
meet
her
how
terrible
of
me
she
exclaimed
to
be
so
late
coming
down
and
papa
too
i
think
you
know
each
her
father
was
advancing
toward
the
young
man
expecting
to
shake
hands
with
him
but
alice
stood
between
them
and
russell
a
little
flushed
bowed
to
him
gravely
over
her
shoulder
without
looking
at
him
whereupon
adams
slightly
disconcerted
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
turned
to
his
wife
i
guess
dinner
ready
he
said
we
better
go
sit
but
she
shook
her
head
at
him
fiercely
wait
she
whispered
what
for
for
walter
no
he
ca
be
coming
she
returned
hurriedly
and
again
warned
him
by
a
shake
of
her
head
be
quiet
oh
well
he
muttered
sit
down
he
was
thoroughly
mystified
but
obeyed
her
gesture
and
went
to
the
in
the
opposite
corner
where
he
sat
down
and
with
an
expression
of
meek
inquiry
awaited
events
meanwhile
alice
prattled
on
it
really
not
a
fault
of
mine
being
tardy
the
shameful
truth
is
i
was
trying
to
hurry
papa
incorrigible
he
stays
so
late
at
his
terrible
old
factory
terrible
new
factory
i
should
say
i
hope
you
do
hate
us
for
making
you
dine
with
us
in
such
fearful
weather
i
nearly
dying
of
the
heat
myself
so
you
have
a
if
that
pleases
you
why
is
it
we
always
bear
things
better
if
we
think
other
people
have
to
stand
them
too
and
she
added
with
an
excited
laugh
silly
of
us
do
you
think
gertrude
had
just
made
her
entrance
from
the
bearing
a
tray
she
came
slowly
with
an
air
of
resentment
and
her
skirt
still
needed
adjusting
while
her
lower
jaw
moved
at
intervals
though
not
now
upon
any
substance
but
reminiscently
of
habit
she
halted
before
adams
facing
him
he
looked
plaintive
what
you
want
o
me
he
asked
for
response
she
extended
the
tray
toward
him
with
a
gesture
of
indifference
but
he
still
appeared
to
be
puzzled
what
in
the
world
he
began
then
caught
his
wife
eye
and
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
take
a
damp
and
plastic
sandwich
from
the
tray
well
i
try
one
he
said
but
a
moment
later
as
he
fulfilled
this
promise
an
expression
of
intense
dislike
came
upon
his
features
and
he
would
have
returned
the
sandwich
to
gertrude
however
as
she
had
crossed
the
room
to
adams
he
checked
the
gesture
and
sat
helplessly
with
the
sandwich
in
his
hand
he
made
another
effort
to
get
rid
of
it
as
the
waitress
passed
him
on
her
way
back
to
the
but
she
appeared
not
to
observe
him
and
he
continued
to
be
troubled
by
it
alice
was
a
loyal
daughter
these
are
delicious
mama
she
said
and
turning
to
russell
you
missed
it
you
should
have
taken
one
too
bad
we
could
have
offered
you
what
ought
to
go
with
it
of
course
but
she
was
interrupted
by
the
second
entrance
of
gertrude
who
announced
dinner
serve
and
retired
from
view
well
well
adams
said
rising
from
his
chair
with
relief
good
let
go
see
if
we
can
eat
and
as
the
little
group
moved
toward
the
open
door
of
the
he
disposed
of
his
sandwich
by
dropping
it
in
the
empty
fireplace
alice
glancing
back
over
her
shoulder
was
the
only
one
who
saw
him
and
she
shuddered
in
spite
of
herself
then
seeing
that
he
looked
at
her
entreatingly
as
if
he
wanted
to
explain
that
he
was
doing
the
best
he
could
she
smiled
upon
him
sunnily
and
began
to
chatter
to
russell
again
chapter
xxii
alice
kept
her
sprightly
chatter
going
when
they
sat
down
though
the
temperature
of
the
room
and
the
sight
of
hot
soup
might
have
discouraged
a
less
determined
gayety
moreover
there
were
details
as
unpropitious
as
the
heat
the
expiring
roses
expressed
not
beauty
but
pathos
and
what
faint
odour
they
exhaled
was
no
rival
to
the
lusty
emanations
of
the
brussels
sprouts
at
the
head
of
the
table
adams
sitting
low
in
his
chair
appeared
to
be
unable
to
flatten
the
uprising
wave
of
his
starched
bosom
and
gertrude
manner
and
expression
were
of
a
recognizable
hostility
during
the
long
period
of
vain
waiting
for
the
cups
of
soup
to
be
emptied
only
adams
made
any
progress
in
this
direction
the
others
merely
feinting
now
and
then
lifting
their
spoons
as
if
they
intended
to
do
something
with
them
alice
talk
was
little
more
than
cheerful
sound
but
to
fill
a
desolate
interval
served
its
purpose
and
her
mother
supported
her
with
cooings
of
applausive
laughter
what
a
funny
thing
weather
is
the
girl
ran
on
yesterday
it
was
cool
angels
had
charge
of
it
and
they
had
an
engagement
somewhere
else
so
the
devil
saw
his
chance
and
started
to
move
the
equator
to
the
north
pole
but
by
the
time
he
got
he
thought
of
something
else
he
wanted
to
do
and
went
off
and
left
the
equator
here
right
on
top
of
us
i
wish
come
back
and
get
it
why
alice
dear
her
mother
cried
fondly
what
an
imagination
not
a
very
pious
one
i
afraid
russell
might
think
though
here
she
gave
gertrude
a
hidden
signal
to
remove
the
soup
but
as
there
was
no
response
she
had
to
make
the
signal
more
conspicuous
gertrude
was
leaning
against
the
wall
her
chin
moving
like
a
slow
pendulum
her
streaked
eyes
fixed
mutinously
upon
russell
adams
nodded
several
times
increasing
the
emphasis
of
her
gesture
while
alice
talked
briskly
but
the
brooding
waitress
continued
to
brood
a
faint
snap
of
the
fingers
failed
to
disturb
her
nor
was
a
covert
hissing
whisper
of
avail
and
adams
was
beginning
to
show
signs
of
strain
when
her
daughter
relieved
her
imagine
our
trying
to
eat
anything
so
hot
as
soup
on
a
night
like
this
alice
laughed
what
could
have
been
in
the
cook
mind
not
to
give
us
something
iced
and
jellied
instead
of
course
it
because
equatorial
herself
originally
and
only
feels
at
home
when
satan
moves
it
she
looked
round
at
gertrude
who
stood
behind
her
do
take
this
dreadful
soup
away
thus
directly
addressed
gertrude
yielded
her
attention
though
unwillingly
and
as
if
she
decided
only
by
a
hair
weight
not
to
revolt
instead
however
she
finally
set
herself
in
slow
motion
but
overlooked
the
supposed
head
of
the
table
seeming
to
be
unaware
of
the
sweltering
little
man
who
sat
there
as
she
disappeared
toward
the
kitchen
with
but
three
of
the
cups
upon
her
tray
he
turned
to
look
plaintively
after
her
and
ventured
an
attempt
to
recall
her
here
he
said
in
a
low
voice
here
you
what
is
it
virgil
his
wife
asked
what
her
name
adams
gave
him
a
glance
of
sudden
panic
and
seeing
that
the
guest
of
the
evening
was
not
looking
at
her
but
down
at
the
white
cloth
before
him
she
frowned
hard
and
shook
her
head
unfortunately
alice
was
not
observing
her
mother
and
asked
innocently
what
whose
name
papa
why
this
young
darky
woman
he
explained
she
left
never
mind
alice
laughed
there
hope
for
you
papa
she
gone
forever
i
do
know
about
that
he
said
not
content
with
this
impulsive
assurance
she
looked
like
she
and
his
remark
considered
as
a
prediction
had
begun
to
seem
warranted
before
gertrude
return
with
china
preliminary
to
the
next
stage
of
the
banquet
alice
proved
herself
equal
to
the
long
gap
and
rattled
on
through
it
with
a
spirit
richly
justifying
her
mother
praise
of
her
as
always
ready
to
smooth
things
over
for
here
was
more
than
long
delay
to
be
smoothed
over
she
smoothed
over
her
father
and
mother
for
russell
and
she
smoothed
over
him
for
them
though
he
did
not
know
it
and
remained
unaware
of
what
he
owed
her
with
all
this
throughout
her
prattlings
the
girl
bright
eyes
kept
seeking
his
with
an
eager
gayety
which
but
little
veiled
both
interrogation
and
entreaty
as
if
she
asked
is
it
too
much
for
you
ca
you
bear
it
wo
you
please
bear
it
i
would
for
you
wo
you
give
me
a
sign
that
it
all
right
he
looked
at
her
but
fleetingly
and
seemed
to
suffer
from
the
heat
in
spite
of
every
manly
effort
not
to
wipe
his
brow
too
often
his
colour
after
rising
when
he
greeted
alice
and
her
father
had
departed
leaving
him
again
moistly
pallid
a
condition
arising
from
discomfort
no
doubt
but
considered
as
a
decoration
almost
poetically
becoming
to
him
not
less
becoming
was
the
faint
kindly
smile
which
showed
his
wish
to
express
amusement
and
approval
and
yet
it
was
a
smile
rather
strained
and
plaintive
as
if
he
like
adams
could
only
do
the
best
he
could
he
pleased
adams
who
thought
him
a
fine
young
man
and
decidedly
the
quietest
that
alice
had
ever
shown
to
her
family
in
her
opinion
this
was
no
small
merit
and
it
was
to
russell
credit
too
that
he
showed
embarrassment
upon
this
first
intimate
presentation
here
was
an
applicant
with
both
reserve
and
modesty
so
far
he
seems
to
be
first
rate
a
mighty
fine
young
man
adams
thought
and
prompted
by
no
wish
to
part
from
alice
but
by
reminiscences
of
apparent
candidates
less
pleasing
he
added
at
last
alice
liveliness
never
flagged
her
smoothing
over
of
things
was
an
almost
continuous
performance
and
had
to
be
yet
while
she
chattered
through
the
hot
and
heavy
courses
the
questions
she
asked
herself
were
as
continuous
as
the
performance
and
as
poignant
as
what
her
eyes
seemed
to
be
asking
russell
why
had
she
not
prevailed
over
her
fear
of
being
skimpy
had
she
been
indeed
as
her
mother
said
she
looked
in
a
trance
but
above
all
what
was
the
matter
with
him
what
had
happened
for
she
told
herself
with
painful
humour
that
something
even
worse
than
this
dinner
must
be
the
matter
with
the
small
room
suffocated
with
the
odour
of
boiled
sprouts
grew
hotter
and
hotter
as
more
and
more
food
appeared
slowly
borne
in
between
deathly
long
waits
by
the
resentful
gertrude
and
while
alice
still
sought
russell
glance
and
read
the
look
upon
his
face
a
dozen
different
ways
fearing
all
of
them
and
while
the
straggling
little
flowers
died
upon
the
stained
cloth
she
felt
her
heart
grow
as
heavy
as
the
food
and
wondered
that
it
did
not
die
like
the
roses
with
the
arrival
of
coffee
the
host
bestirred
himself
to
make
known
a
hospitable
regret
by
george
he
said
i
meant
to
buy
some
he
addressed
himself
apologetically
to
the
guest
i
do
know
what
i
was
thinking
about
to
forget
to
bring
some
home
with
me
i
do
use
myself
unless
somebody
hands
me
one
you
might
say
i
always
been
a
pure
and
simple
but
i
ought
to
remembered
for
kind
of
an
occasion
like
not
at
all
russell
said
i
not
smoking
at
all
lately
but
when
i
do
i
like
you
and
smoke
a
alice
started
remembering
what
she
had
told
him
when
he
overtook
her
on
her
way
from
the
tobacconist
but
after
a
moment
looking
at
him
she
decided
that
he
must
have
forgotten
it
if
he
had
remembered
she
thought
he
could
not
have
helped
glancing
at
her
on
the
contrary
he
seemed
more
at
ease
just
then
than
he
had
since
they
sat
down
for
he
was
favouring
her
father
with
a
thoughtful
attention
as
adams
responded
to
the
introduction
of
a
man
topic
into
the
conversation
at
last
well
russell
i
guess
you
right
at
that
i
do
say
but
what
cigars
may
be
all
right
for
a
man
that
can
afford
if
he
likes
better
than
a
pipe
but
you
take
a
good
old
pipe
now
he
continued
and
was
getting
well
into
the
eulogium
customarily
provoked
by
this
theme
when
there
came
an
interruption
the
rang
and
he
paused
inquiringly
rather
surprised
adams
spoke
to
gertrude
in
an
undertone
just
say
at
home
what
if
it
callers
just
say
we
not
at
gertrude
spoke
out
freely
you
mean
you
astin
me
to
you
front
do
fer
you
she
seemed
both
incredulous
and
affronted
but
adams
persisted
though
somewhat
apprehensively
yes
hurry
uh
please
just
say
not
at
home
if
you
again
gertrude
obviously
hesitated
between
compliance
and
revolt
and
again
the
meeker
course
fortunately
prevailed
with
her
she
gave
adams
a
stare
grimly
derisive
then
departed
when
she
came
back
she
said
he
say
he
but
i
told
you
to
tell
anybody
we
were
not
at
home
mrs
adams
returned
who
is
it
say
he
name
we
do
know
any
yes
he
know
you
say
he
anxious
to
speak
adams
say
he
tell
him
adams
is
hold
on
a
minute
adams
intervened
law
no
i
do
know
any
law
you
sure
you
got
the
name
right
say
he
name
law
gertrude
replied
looking
at
the
ceiling
to
express
her
fatigue
law
all
he
tell
me

i
adams
frowned
law
he
said
was
it
maybe
law
gertrude
repeated
all
he
tell
me
all
i
what
he
look
like
he
ai
much
she
said
you
age

brustly
white
moustache
nice

charley
lohr
adams
exclaimed
i
go
see
what
he
but
virgil
his
wife
remonstrated
do
finish
your
coffee
he
might
stay
all
evening
maybe
he
come
to
adams
laughed
he
is
much
of
a
caller
i
expect
do
worry
take
him
up
to
my
and
turning
toward
russell
ah
if
you
just
excuse
me
he
said
and
went
out
to
his
visitor
when
he
had
gone
adams
finished
her
coffee
and
having
glanced
intelligently
from
her
guest
to
her
daughter
she
rose
i
think
perhaps
i
ought
to
go
and
shake
hands
with
lohr
myself
she
said
adding
in
explanation
to
russell
as
she
reached
the
door
he
an
old
friend
of
my
husband
and
it
a
very
long
time
since
he
been
alice
nodded
and
smiled
to
her
brightly
but
upon
the
closing
of
the
door
the
smile
vanished
all
her
liveliness
disappeared
and
with
this
change
of
expression
her
complexion
itself
appeared
to
change
so
that
her
rouge
became
obvious
for
she
was
pale
beneath
it
however
russell
did
not
see
the
alteration
for
he
did
not
look
at
her
and
it
was
but
a
momentary
lapse
the
vacation
of
a
tired
girl
who
for
ten
seconds
lets
herself
look
as
she
feels
then
she
shot
her
vivacity
back
into
place
as
by
some
powerful
spring
penny
for
your
thoughts
she
cried
and
tossed
one
of
the
wilted
roses
at
him
across
the
table
i
bid
more
than
a
penny
i
bid
tuppence
no
a
poor
little
dead
rose
a
rose
for
your
thoughts
arthur
russell
what
are
they
he
shook
his
head
i
afraid
i
have
no
of
course
not
she
said
who
could
have
thoughts
in
weather
like
this
will
you
ever
forgive
us
what
for
making
you
eat
such
a
heavy
dinner
i
mean
look
at
such
a
heavy
dinner
because
you
certainly
did
do
more
than
look
at
it
on
such
a
night
but
the
crime
draws
to
a
close
and
you
can
begin
to
cheer
up
she
laughed
gaily
and
rising
moved
to
the
door
let
go
in
the
other
room
your
fearful
duty
is
almost
done
and
you
can
run
home
as
soon
as
you
want
to
that
what
you
dying
to
not
at
all
he
said
in
a
voice
so
feeble
that
she
laughed
aloud
good
gracious
she
cried
i
had
realized
it
was
that
bad
for
this
though
he
contrived
to
laugh
he
seemed
to
have
no
verbal
retort
whatever
but
followed
her
into
the
where
she
stopped
and
turned
facing
him
has
it
really
been
so
frightful
she
asked
why
of
course
not
not
at
of
course
yes
though
you
mean
not
at
all
it
been
most
kind
of
your
mother
and
father
and
do
you
know
she
said
you
never
once
looked
at
me
for
more
than
a
second
at
a
time
the
whole
evening
and
it
seemed
to
me
i
looked
rather
nice
too
you
always
do
he
murmured
i
do
see
how
you
know
she
returned
and
then
stepping
closer
to
him
spoke
with
gentle
solicitude
tell
me
you
really
feeling
wretchedly
are
you
i
know
you
got
a
fearful
headache
or
something
tell
me
not
at
you
are
ill
i
sure
of
not
at
on
your
word
i
really
quite
all
but
if
you
are
she
began
and
then
looking
at
him
with
a
desperate
sweetness
as
if
this
were
her
last
resource
to
rouse
him
what
the
matter
little
boy
she
said
with
lisping
tenderness
tell
auntie
it
was
a
mistake
for
he
seemed
to
flinch
and
to
lean
backward
however
slightly
she
turned
away
instantly
with
a
flippant
lift
and
drop
of
both
hands
oh
my
dear
she
laughed
i
wo
eat
you
and
as
the
discomfited
young
man
watched
her
seeming
able
to
lift
his
eyes
now
that
her
back
was
turned
she
went
to
the
front
door
and
pushed
open
the
screen
let
go
out
on
the
porch
she
said
where
we
belong
then
when
he
had
followed
her
out
and
they
were
seated
is
this
better
she
asked
do
you
feel
more
like
yourself
out
here
he
began
a
murmur
not
at
but
she
cut
him
off
sharply
please
do
say
at
all
again
i
you
do
seem
sorry
about
something
she
said
what
is
it
is
it
time
you
were
telling
me
what
the
matter
nothing
indeed
nothing
the
matter
of
course
one
is
rather
affected
by
such
weather
as
this
it
may
make
one
a
little
quieter
than
usual
of
she
sighed
and
let
the
tired
muscles
of
her
face
rest
under
the
hard
lights
indoors
they
had
served
her
until
they
ached
and
it
was
a
luxury
to
feel
that
in
the
darkness
no
grimacings
need
call
upon
them
of
course
if
you
wo
tell
me
she
said
i
can
only
assure
you
there
nothing
to
i
know
what
an
ugly
little
house
it
is
she
said
maybe
it
was
the
furniture
or
mama
vases
that
upset
you
or
was
it
mama
herself
or
papa
nothing
at
that
she
uttered
a
monosyllable
of
doubting
laughter
i
wonder
why
you
say
because
it
no
it
because
you
too
kind
or
too
conscientious
or
too
embarrassed
anyhow
too
something
to
tell
she
leaned
forward
elbows
on
knees
and
chin
in
hands
in
the
reflective
attitude
she
knew
how
to
make
graceful
i
have
a
feeling
that
you
not
going
to
tell
me
she
said
slowly
yes
even
that
you
never
going
to
tell
me
i
wonder
i
wonder
yes
what
do
you
wonder
i
was
just
thinking
i
wonder
if
they
have
done
it
after
i
do
i
wonder
she
went
on
still
slowly
and
in
a
voice
of
reflection
i
wonder
who
has
been
talking
about
me
to
you
after
all
is
that
it
not
at
he
began
but
checked
himself
and
substituted
another
form
of
denial
nothing
is
are
you
sure
why
how
curious
she
said
why
because
all
evening
you
been
so
utterly
but
in
this
weather
no
that
would
make
you
afraid
to
look
at
me
all
evening
but
i
did
look
at
you
no
not
really
a
but
i
looking
at
you
yes
in
the
dark
she
said
no
the
weather
might
make
you
even
quieter
than
usual
but
it
would
strike
you
so
nearly
dumb
no
and
it
would
make
you
seem
to
be
under
such
a
strain
as
if
you
thought
only
of
escape
but
i
have
you
should
she
interrupted
gently
there
nothing
you
have
to
escape
from
you
know
you
are
committed
to
to
this
i
sorry
you
think
he
began
but
did
not
complete
the
fragment
she
took
it
up
you
sorry
i
think
you
so
different
you
mean
to
say
do
you
never
mind
that
what
you
did
mean
to
say
but
you
could
finish
it
because
you
not
good
at
oh
no
he
protested
feebly
i
not
deceiving
i
never
mind
she
said
again
you
sorry
i
think
you
so
different
and
all
in
one
day
since
last
night
yes
your
voice
sounds
sorry
too
it
sounds
sorrier
than
it
would
just
because
of
my
thinking
something
you
could
change
my
mind
about
in
a
minute
so
it
means
sorry
you
are
no
i
but
disregarding
the
faint
denial
never
mind
she
said
do
you
remember
one
night
when
you
told
me
that
nothing
anybody
else
could
do
would
ever
keep
you
from
coming
here
that
if
you
if
you
left
me
it
would
be
because
i
drove
you
away
myself
yes
he
said
huskily
it
was
are
you
sure
indeed
i
am
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
but
with
conviction
then
she
paused
well
but
i
have
driven
you
and
yet
you
gone
she
said
quietly
do
i
seem
so
stupid
as
all
that
you
know
what
i
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
again
and
her
hands
inactive
for
once
lay
motionless
in
her
lap
when
she
spoke
it
was
in
a
rueful
whisper
i
wonder
if
i
have
driven
you
away
you
done
nothing
nothing
at
all
he
said
i
wonder
she
said
once
more
but
she
stopped
in
her
mind
she
was
going
back
over
their
time
together
since
the
first
meeting
fragments
of
talk
moments
of
silence
little
things
of
no
importance
little
things
that
might
be
important
moonshine
sunshine
starlight
and
her
thoughts
zigzagged
among
the
jumbling
memories
but
as
if
she
made
for
herself
a
picture
of
all
these
fragments
throwing
them
upon
the
canvas
haphazard
she
saw
them
all
just
touched
with
the
one
tainting
quality
that
gave
them
coherence
the
faint
false
haze
she
had
put
over
this
friendship
by
her
own
pretendings
and
if
this
terrible
dinner
or
anything
or
everything
had
shown
that
saffron
tint
in
its
true
colour
to
the
man
at
her
side
last
night
almost
a
lover
then
she
had
indeed
of
herself
driven
him
away
and
might
well
feel
that
she
was
lost
do
you
know
she
said
suddenly
in
a
clear
loud
voice
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
i
feel
as
if
i
were
going
to
be
with
you
only
about
five
minutes
more
in
all
the
rest
of
my
life
why
no
he
said
of
course
i
coming
to
see
you
often
i
no
she
interrupted
i
never
had
a
feeling
like
this
before
it
it
just
so
that
all
you
going
why
you
never
coming
here
again
she
stood
up
abruptly
beginning
to
tremble
all
over
why
it
finished
is
it
she
said
and
her
trembling
was
manifest
now
in
her
voice
why
it
all
over
is
it
why
yes
he
had
risen
as
she
did
i
afraid
you
awfully
tired
and
nervous
he
said
i
really
ought
to
be
yes
of
course
you
ought
she
cried
despairingly
there
nothing
else
for
you
to
do
when
anything
spoiled
people
ca
do
anything
but
run
away
from
it
so
at
least
he
returned
huskily
we
only
only
say
then
as
moving
to
go
he
stumbled
upon
the
veranda
steps
your
hat
she
cried
i
like
to
keep
it
for
a
souvenir
but
i
afraid
you
need
it
she
ran
into
the
hall
and
brought
his
straw
hat
from
the
chair
where
he
had
left
it
you
poor
thing
she
said
with
quavering
laughter
you
know
you
ca
go
without
your
hat
then
as
they
faced
each
other
for
the
short
moment
which
both
of
them
knew
would
be
the
last
of
all
their
veranda
moments
alice
broken
laughter
grew
louder
what
a
thing
to
say
she
cried
what
a
romantic
parting
talking
about
hats
her
laughter
continued
as
he
turned
away
but
other
sounds
came
from
within
the
house
clearly
audible
with
the
opening
of
a
door
upstairs
a
long
and
wailing
cry
of
lamentation
in
the
voice
of
adams
russell
paused
at
the
steps
uncertain
but
alice
waved
to
him
to
go
on
oh
do
bother
she
said
we
have
lots
of
that
in
this
funny
little
old
house
and
as
he
went
down
the
steps
she
ran
back
into
the
house
and
closed
the
door
heavily
behind
her
chapter
xxiii
her
mother
wailing
could
still
be
heard
from
overhead
though
more
faintly
and
old
charley
lohr
was
coming
down
the
stairs
alone
he
looked
at
alice
compassionately
i
was
just
comin
to
suggest
maybe
you
excuse
yourself
from
your
company
he
said
your
mother
was
bound
not
to
disturb
you
and
tried
her
best
to
keep
you
from
how
she
takin
on
but
i
thought
probably
you
better
see
to
yes
i
come
what
the
matter
well
he
said
only
stepped
over
to
offer
my
sympathy
and
services
as
it
were
thought
of
course
you
folks
knew
all
about
it
fact
is
it
was
in
the
evening
paper
just
a
little
bit
of
an
item
on
the
back
page
of
what
is
it
he
coughed
well
it
ai
anything
so
terrible
he
said
fact
is
your
brother
walter
got
in
a
little
trouble
well
i
suppose
you
might
call
it
quite
a
good
deal
of
trouble
fact
is
he
quite
considerable
short
in
his
accounts
down
at
lamb
and
alice
ran
up
the
stairs
and
into
her
father
room
where
adams
threw
herself
into
her
daughter
arms
is
he
gone
she
sobbed
he
did
hear
me
did
he
i
tried
so
hard
alice
patted
the
heaving
shoulders
her
arms
enclosed
no
no
she
said
he
did
hear
you
it
would
have
mattered
he
does
matter
oh
poor
walter
the
mother
cried
oh
the
poor
boy
poor
poor
walter
poor
poor
poor
poor
hush
dear
hush
alice
tried
to
soothe
her
but
the
lament
could
not
be
abated
and
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
a
repetition
in
a
different
spirit
was
as
continuous
adams
paced
furiously
there
pounding
his
fist
into
his
left
palm
as
he
strode
the
dang
boy
he
said
dang
little
fool
dang
idiot
dang
fool
why
he
tell
me
the
dang
little
fool
he
did
adams
sobbed
he
did
tell
you
and
you
would
give
it
to
he
did
did
he
adams
shouted
at
her
what
he
begged
me
for
was
money
to
run
away
with
he
never
dreamed
of
putting
back
what
he
took
what
the
dangnation
you
talking
about
accusing
me
he
needed
it
she
said
he
needed
it
to
run
away
with
how
could
he
expect
to
live
after
he
got
away
if
he
did
have
a
little
money
oh
poor
poor
poor
walter
poor
poor
poor
she
went
back
to
this
repetition
and
adams
went
back
to
his
own
then
paused
seeing
his
old
friend
standing
in
the
hallway
outside
the
open
door
ah
i
just
be
goin
i
guess
virgil
lohr
said
i
do
see
as
there
any
use
my
tryin
to
say
any
more
i
do
anything
you
want
me
to
you
wait
a
minute
adams
said
and
groaning
came
and
went
down
the
stairs
with
him
you
say
you
did
see
the
old
man
at
all
no
i
do
know
a
thing
about
what
he
going
to
do
lohr
said
as
they
reached
the
lower
floor
not
a
thing
but
look
here
virgil
i
do
see
as
this
calls
for
you
and
your
wife
to
take
on
so
hard
about
anyhow
not
as
hard
as
the
way
you
no
adams
gulped
it
always
seems
that
way
to
the
other
party
only
looking
on
oh
well
i
know
that
of
course
old
charley
returned
soothingly
but
look
here
virgil
they
may
not
catch
the
boy
they
did
even
seem
to
be
sure
what
train
he
made
and
if
they
do
get
him
why
the
ole
man
might
decide
not
to
prosecute
if
him
adams
cried
interrupting
him
not
prosecute
why
that
what
he
been
waiting
for
all
along
he
thinks
my
boy
and
me
both
cheated
him
why
he
was
just
letting
walter
walk
into
a
trap
did
you
say
they
been
suspecting
him
for
some
time
back
did
you
say
been
watching
him
and
were
just
about
fixing
to
arrest
him
yes
i
know
said
lohr
but
you
ca
tell
especially
if
you
raise
the
money
and
pay
it
every
cent
adams
vociferated
every
last
penny
i
can
raise
it
i
got
to
raise
it
i
going
to
put
a
loan
on
my
factory
oh
i
get
it
for
him
you
tell
him
every
last
penny
well
ole
feller
you
just
try
and
get
quieted
down
some
charley
held
out
his
hand
in
parting
you
and
your
wife
just
quiet
down
some
you
ai
the
healthiest
man
in
the
world
you
know
and
you
already
been
under
quite
some
strain
before
this
happened
you
want
to
take
care
of
yourself
for
the
sake
of
your
wife
and
that
sweet
little
girl
upstairs
you
know
now
he
finished
stepping
out
upon
the
veranda
you
send
for
me
if
there
anything
i
can
do
adams
echoed
there
ai
anything
anybody
can
do
and
then
as
his
old
friend
went
down
the
path
to
the
sidewalk
he
called
after
him
you
tell
him
i
pay
him
every
last
cent
every
last
dang
dirty
penny
he
slammed
the
door
and
went
rapidly
up
the
stairs
talking
loudly
to
himself
every
dang
last
dirty
penny
thinks
everybody
in
this
family
wants
to
steal
from
him
does
he
thinks
we
all
yellow
does
he
i
show
him
and
he
came
into
his
own
room
vociferating
every
last
dang
dirty
penny
adams
had
collapsed
and
alice
had
put
her
upon
his
bed
where
she
lay
tossing
convulsively
and
sobbing
oh
poor
walter
over
and
over
but
after
a
time
she
varied
the
sorry
tune
oh
poor
alice
she
moaned
clinging
to
her
daughter
hand
oh
poor
poor
alice
to
have
this
come
on
the
night
of
your
dinner
just
when
everything
seemed
to
be
going
so
well
at
last
oh
poor
poor
poor
hush
alice
said
sharply
do
say
alice
i
all
you
must
be
her
mother
cried
clutching
her
you
just
got
to
be
one
of
us
has
got
to
be
all
right
surely
god
would
mind
just
one
of
us
being
all
right
that
would
hurt
him
hush
hush
mother
hush
but
adams
only
clutched
her
the
more
tightly
he
seemed
such
a
nice
young
man
dearie
he
may
not
see
this
in
the
paper
lohr
said
it
was
just
a
little
bit
of
an
item
he
may
not
see
it
dearie
then
her
anguish
went
back
to
walter
again
and
to
his
needs
as
a
fugitive
she
had
meant
to
repair
his
underwear
but
had
postponed
doing
so
and
her
neglect
now
appeared
to
be
a
detail
as
lamentable
as
the
calamity
itself
she
could
neither
be
stilled
upon
it
nor
herself
exhaust
its
urgings
to
though
she
finally
took
up
another
theme
temporarily
upon
an
unusually
violent
outbreak
of
her
husband
in
denunciation
of
the
runaway
she
cried
out
faintly
that
he
was
cruel
and
further
wearied
her
broken
voice
with
details
of
walter
beauty
as
a
baby
and
of
his
bedtime
pieties
throughout
his
infancy
so
the
hot
night
wore
on
three
had
struck
before
adams
was
got
to
bed
and
alice
returning
to
her
own
room
could
hear
her
father
bare
feet
thudding
back
and
forth
after
that
poor
papa
she
whispered
in
helpless
imitation
of
her
mother
poor
papa
poor
mama
poor
walter
poor
all
of
us
she
fell
asleep
after
a
time
while
from
across
the
hall
the
bare
feet
still
thudded
over
their
changeless
route
and
she
woke
at
seven
hearing
adams
pass
her
door
shod
in
her
wrapper
she
ran
out
into
the
hallway
and
found
him
descending
the
stairs
papa
hush
he
said
and
looked
up
at
her
with
reddened
eyes
do
wake
your
i
wo
she
whispered
how
about
you
you
have
slept
any
at
all

did
i

some
sleep

going
over
to
the

figures
together

bank

back
to
bed
wait
she
bade
him
sharply
what
for
you
got
to
have
some
do
want
you
wait
she
said
imperiously
and
disappeared
to
return
almost
at
once
i
can
cook
in
my
bedroom
slippers
she
explained
but
i
believe
i
could
in
my
bare
feet
descending
softly
she
made
him
wait
in
the
until
she
brought
him
toast
and
eggs
and
coffee
eat
she
said
and
i
going
to
telephone
for
a
taxicab
to
take
you
if
you
think
you
really
got
to
no
i
going
to
walk

want

she
shook
her
head
anxiously
you
do
look
able

walked
all
no
i
did
he
returned
i
tell
you
i
got
some
sleep
i
got
all
i
wanted
but
papa
here
he
interrupted
looking
up
at
her
suddenly
and
setting
down
his
cup
of
coffee
look
here
what
about
this
russell
i
forgot
all
about
him
what
about
him
her
lip
trembled
a
little
but
she
controlled
it
before
she
spoke
well
what
about
him
papa
she
asked
calmly
enough
well
we
could
hardly
adams
paused
frowning
heavily
we
could
hardly
expect
he
would
hear
something
about
all
yes
of
course
he
hear
it
well
well
what
she
asked
gently
you
do
think
he
be
the
the
cheap
kind
it
make
a
difference
with
of
oh
no
he
is
cheap
it
wo
make
any
difference
with
adams
suffered
a
profound
sigh
to
escape
him
well
i
glad
of
that
the
difference
she
explained
the
difference
was
made
without
his
hearing
anything
about
walter
he
does
know
about
that
well
what
does
he
know
about
only
she
said
about
what
you
mean
by
that
alice
he
asked
helplessly
never
mind
she
said
it
nothing
beside
the
real
trouble
in
i
tell
you
some
time
you
eat
your
eggs
and
toast
you
ca
keep
going
on
just
i
ca
eat
any
eggs
and
toast
he
objected
rising
i
then
wait
till
i
can
bring
you
something
no
he
said
irritably
i
wo
do
it
i
do
want
any
dang
food
and
look
here
he
spoke
sharply
to
stop
her
as
she
went
toward
the
telephone
i
do
want
any
dang
taxi
either
you
look
after
your
mother
when
she
wakes
up
i
got
to
be
at
work
and
though
she
followed
him
to
the
front
door
entreating
he
could
not
be
stayed
or
hindered
he
went
through
the
quiet
morning
streets
at
a
rickety
rapid
gait
swinging
his
old
straw
hat
in
his
hands
and
whispering
angrily
to
himself
as
he
went
his
grizzled
hair
not
trimmed
for
a
month
blew
back
from
his
damp
forehead
in
the
warm
breeze
his
reddened
eyes
stared
hard
at
nothing
from
under
blinking
lids
and
one
side
of
his
face
twitched
startlingly
from
time
to
time
children
might
have
run
from
him
or
mocked
him
when
he
had
come
into
that
fallen
quarter
his
industry
had
partly
revived
and
wholly
made
odorous
a
negro
woman
leaning
upon
her
whitewashed
gate
gazed
after
him
and
chuckled
for
the
benefit
of
a
gossiping
friend
in
the
next
tiny
yard
oh
good
satan
matter
that
ole
glue
man
who
him
the
neighbour
inquired
what
he
do
now
talkin
to
his
ole
the
first
explained
joyously
look
like
gone
distracted
ole
glue
man
adams
legs
had
grown
more
uncertain
with
his
hard
walk
and
he
stumbled
heavily
as
he
crossed
the
baked
mud
of
his
broad
lot
but
cared
little
for
that
was
almost
unaware
of
it
in
fact
thus
his
eyes
saw
as
little
as
his
body
felt
and
so
he
failed
to
observe
something
that
would
have
given
him
additional
light
upon
an
old
phrase
that
already
meant
quite
enough
for
him
there
are
in
the
wide
world
people
who
have
never
learned
its
meaning
but
most
are
either
young
or
beautifully
unobservant
who
remain
wholly
unaware
of
the
inner
poignancies
the
words
convey
a
rain
of
it
is
a
boiling
rain
seemingly
whimsical
in
its
choice
of
spots
whereon
to
fall
and
so
far
as
mortal
eye
can
tell
neither
the
just
nor
the
unjust
may
hope
to
avoid
it
or
need
worry
themselves
by
expecting
it
it
had
selected
the
adams
family
for
its
scaldings
no
question
the
foreman
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
brick
shed
observed
his
employer
eccentric
approach
and
doubtfully
stroked
a
whiskered
chin
well
they
ai
no
putticular
use
gettin
so
upset
over
it
he
said
as
adams
came
up
when
a
thing
happens
why
it
happens
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
when
a
thing
so
why
it
so
all
you
can
do
about
it
is
think
if
there
anything
you
can
do
and
that
what
you
better
be
doin
with
this
adams
halted
and
seemed
to
gape
at
him
what
case
he
said
with
difficulty
was
it
in
the
morning
papers
too
no
it
ai
in
no
morning
papers
my
land
it
do
need
to
be
in
no
papers
look
at
the
size
of
it
the
size
of
what
why
great
god
the
foreman
exclaimed
he
ai
even
seen
it
look
look
yonder
adams
stared
vaguely
at
the
man
outstretched
hand
and
pointing
forefinger
then
turned
and
saw
a
great
sign
upon
the
facade
of
the
big
factory
building
across
the
street
the
letters
were
large
enough
to
be
read
two
blocks
away
after
the
fifteenth
of
next
month
this
building
will
be
occupied
by
the
j
lamb
liquid
glue
a
gray
had
just
come
to
rest
before
the
principal
entrance
of
the
building
and
j
lamb
himself
descended
from
it
he
glanced
over
toward
the
humble
rival
of
his
projected
great
industry
saw
his
old
clerk
and
immediately
walked
across
the
street
and
the
lot
to
speak
to
him
well
adams
he
said
in
his
husky
cheerful
voice
how
your
adams
uttered
an
inarticulate
sound
and
lifted
the
hand
that
held
his
hat
as
if
to
make
a
protective
gesture
but
failed
to
carry
it
out
and
his
arm
sank
limp
at
his
side
the
foreman
however
seemed
to
feel
that
something
ought
to
be
said
our
hell
he
remarked
i
guess
we
wo
have
no
over
here
not
very
long
if
we
got
to
compete
with
the
sized
thing
you
got
over
there
lamb
chuckled
i
kind
of
had
some
such
notion
he
said
you
see
virgil
i
could
exactly
let
you
walk
off
with
it
like
swallering
a
pat
o
butter
now
could
i
it
did
look
exactly
reasonable
to
expect
me
to
let
go
like
that
now
did
it
adams
found
a
voice
somewhere
in
his
throat
do
you
would
you
step
into
my
office
a
minute
lamb
why
certainly
i
willing
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
the
old
gentleman
said
as
he
followed
his
former
employee
indoors
and
he
added
i
feel
a
lot
more
like
it
than
i
did
before
i
got
that
up
over
yonder
virgil
adams
threw
open
the
door
of
the
rough
room
he
called
his
office
having
as
justification
for
this
title
little
more
than
the
fact
that
he
had
a
telephone
there
and
a
deal
table
that
served
as
a
desk
just
step
into
the
office
please
he
said
lamb
glanced
at
the
desk
at
the
kitchen
chair
before
it
at
the
telephone
and
at
the
partition
walls
built
of
old
boards
some
covered
with
ancient
paint
and
some
merely
weatherbeaten
the
salvage
of
a
and
he
smiled
broadly
so
these
are
your
offices
are
they
he
asked
you
expect
to
do
quite
a
business
here
i
guess
you
virgil
adams
turned
upon
him
a
stricken
and
tortured
face
have
you
seen
charley
lohr
since
last
night
lamb
no
i
have
seen
well
i
told
him
to
tell
you
adams
began
i
told
him
i
pay
you
pay
me
what
you
expect
to
make
out
o
glue
you
mean
virgil
no
adams
said
swallowing
i
mean
what
my
boy
owes
you
that
what
i
told
charley
to
tell
you
i
told
him
to
tell
you
i
pay
you
every
last
well
well
the
old
gentleman
interrupted
testily
i
do
know
anything
about
i
expecting
to
pay
you
adams
went
on
swallowing
again
painfully
i
was
expecting
to
do
it
out
of
a
loan
i
thought
i
could
get
on
my
the
old
gentleman
lifted
his
frosted
eyebrows
oh
out
o
the
you
expected
to
raise
money
on
the
did
you
at
that
adams
agitation
increased
prodigiously
how
you
think
i
expected
to
pay
you
he
said
did
you
think
i
expected
to
get
money
on
my
own
old
bones
he
slapped
himself
harshly
upon
the
chest
and
legs
do
you
think
a
bank
lend
money
on
a
man
ribs
and
his
old
they
wo
do
it
you
got
to
have
some
business
prospects
to
show
if
you
have
got
any
property
nor
securities
and
what
business
prospects
have
i
got
now
with
that
sign
of
yours
up
over
yonder
why
you
do
need
to
make
an
ounce
o
glue
your
fixed
me
without
your
doing
another
lick
that
all
you
had
to
do
just
put
your
sign
up
you
need
to
just
let
me
tell
you
something
virgil
adams
the
old
man
interrupted
harshly
i
got
just
one
right
important
thing
to
tell
you
before
we
talk
any
further
business
and
that
this
there
some
few
men
in
this
town
made
their
money
in
ways
but
there
are
many
and
those
there
are
have
had
to
be
a
darn
sight
slicker
than
you
know
how
to
be
or
ever
will
know
how
to
be
yes
sir
and
they
none
of
them
had
the
little
gumption
to
try
to
make
it
out
of
a
man
that
had
the
spirit
not
to
let
and
the
strength
not
to
let
i
know
what
you
thought
you
said
to
yourself
this
ole
fool
j
lamb
kind
of
worn
out
and
in
his
second
childhood
like
i
can
put
it
over
on
him
without
his
ever
i
did
not
adams
shouted
a
great
deal
you
know
about
my
feelings
and
all
what
i
said
to
myself
there
one
thing
i
want
to
tell
you
and
that
what
i
saying
to
myself
now
and
what
my
feelings
are
this
minute
he
struck
the
table
a
great
blow
with
his
thin
fist
and
shook
the
damaged
knuckles
in
the
air
i
just
want
to
tell
you
whatever
i
did
feel
i
do
feel
mean
any
more
not
i
do
there
a
meaner
man
in
this
world
than
am
lamb
oh
so
you
feel
better
about
yourself
do
you
virgil
you
bet
i
do
you
worked
till
you
got
me
where
you
want
me
and
i
would
do
that
to
another
man
no
matter
what
he
did
to
me
i
would
what
you
talkin
about
how
i
you
where
i
want
you
ai
it
plain
enough
adams
cried
you
even
got
me
where
i
raise
the
money
to
pay
back
what
my
boy
owes
you
do
you
suppose
anybody
fool
enough
to
let
me
have
a
cent
on
this
business
after
one
look
at
what
you
got
over
there
across
the
road
no
i
no
you
do
adams
echoed
hoarsely
what
more
you
knew
my
house
was
mortgaged
and
my
i
did
not
lamb
interrupted
angrily
what
do
care
about
your
house
what
the
use
your
talking
like
that
adams
cried
you
got
me
where
i
ca
even
raise
the
money
to
pay
what
my
boy
owes
the
company
i
ca
show
any
reason
to
stop
the
prosecution
and
keep
him
out
the
penitentiary
that
where
you
worked
till
you
got
me
what
lamb
shouted
you
accuse
me
of
you
what
am
i
telling
you
do
you
think
i
got
no
eyes
and
adams
hammered
the
table
again
why
you
knew
the
boy
was
weak
i
did
not
listen
you
kept
him
there
after
you
got
mad
at
my
leaving
the
way
i
did
you
kept
him
there
after
you
suspected
him
and
you
had
him
watched
you
let
him
go
on
just
waited
to
catch
him
and
ruin
him
you
crazy
the
old
man
bellowed
i
did
know
there
was
anything
against
the
boy
till
last
night
you
crazy
i
say
adams
looked
it
with
his
hair
disordered
over
his
haggard
forehead
and
bloodshot
eyes
with
his
bruised
hands
pounding
the
table
and
flying
in
a
hundred
wild
and
absurd
gestures
while
his
feet
shuffled
constantly
to
preserve
his
balance
upon
staggering
legs
he
was
the
picture
of
a
man
with
a
mind
gone
to
rags
maybe
i
am
crazy
he
cried
his
voice
breaking
and
quavering
maybe
i
am
but
i
would
stand
there
and
taunt
a
man
with
it
if
i
done
to
him
what
you
done
to
me
just
look
at
me
i
worked
all
my
life
for
you
and
what
i
did
when
i
quit
never
harmed
you
it
did
make
two
cents
worth
o
difference
in
your
life
and
it
looked
like
it
mean
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
my
family
and
now
look
what
you
done
to
me
for
it
i
tell
you
lamb
there
never
was
a
man
looked
up
to
another
man
the
way
i
looked
up
to
you
the
whole
o
my
life
but
i
look
up
to
you
any
more
you
think
you
got
a
fine
day
of
it
now
riding
up
in
your
automobile
to
look
at
that
sign
and
then
over
here
at
my
poor
little
works
that
you
ruined
but
listen
to
me
just
this
one
last
time
the
cracking
voice
broke
into
falsetto
and
the
gesticulating
hands
fluttered
uncontrollably
just
you
listen
he
panted
you
think
i
did
you
a
bad
turn
and
now
you
got
me
ruined
for
it
and
you
got
my
works
ruined
and
my
family
ruined
and
if
told
me
this
time
last
year
i
ever
say
such
a
thing
to
you
called
him
a
dang
liar
but
i
do
say
it
i
say
you
acted
toward
me
like
like
a
a
doggone
mean
man
his
voice
exhausted
like
his
body
was
just
able
to
do
him
this
final
service
then
he
sank
crumpled
into
the
chair
by
the
table
his
chin
down
hard
upon
his
chest
i
tell
you
you
crazy
lamb
said
again
i
never
in
the
world
but
he
checked
himself
staring
in
sudden
perplexity
at
his
accuser
look
here
he
said
what
the
matter
of
you
have
you
got
another
of
those
he
put
his
hand
upon
adams
shoulder
which
jerked
feebly
under
the
touch
the
old
man
went
to
the
door
and
called
to
the
foreman
here
he
said
run
and
tell
my
chauffeur
to
bring
my
car
over
here
tell
him
to
drive
right
up
over
the
sidewalk
and
across
the
lot
tell
him
to
hurry
so
it
happened
the
great
j
lamb
a
second
time
brought
his
former
clerk
home
stricken
and
almost
inanimate
chapter
xxiv
about
five
that
afternoon
the
old
gentleman
came
back
to
adams
house
and
when
alice
opened
the
door
he
nodded
walked
into
the
without
speaking
then
stood
frowning
as
if
he
hesitated
to
decide
some
perplexing
question
well
how
is
he
now
he
asked
finally
the
doctor
was
here
again
a
little
while
ago
he
thinks
papa
coming
through
it
he
pretty
sure
he
something
like
the
way
it
was
last
spring
not
a
bit
of
sense
to
it
lamb
said
gruffly
when
he
was
getting
well
the
other
time
the
doctor
told
me
it
was
a
regular
stroke
so
to
speak
this
effusion
thing
said
there
was
any
particular
reason
for
your
father
to
expect
he
ever
have
another
attack
if
take
a
little
care
of
himself
said
he
could
consider
himself
well
as
anybody
else
long
as
he
did
yes
but
he
did
do
it
lamb
nodded
sighed
aloud
and
crossed
the
room
to
a
chair
i
guess
not
he
said
as
he
sat
down
bustin
his
health
up
over
his
i
i
guess
so
i
guess
then
he
looked
up
at
her
with
a
glimmer
of
anxiety
in
his
eyes
has
he
came
to
yet
yes
he
talked
a
little
his
mind
clear
he
spoke
to
mama
and
me
and
to
miss
alice
laughed
sadly
we
were
lucky
enough
to
get
her
back
but
papa
did
seem
to
think
it
was
lucky
when
he
recognized
her
he
said
my
goodness
is
you
is
it
well
that
a
good
sign
if
he
getting
a
little
cross
did
he
did
he
happen
to
say
anything
for
instance
about
me
this
question
awkwardly
delivered
had
the
effect
of
removing
the
girl
pallor
rosy
tints
came
quickly
upon
her
cheeks
he
yes
he
did
she
said
naturally
he
troubled
about
about
she
stopped
about
your
brother
maybe
yes
about
making
up
the
here
now
lamb
said
uncomfortably
as
she
stopped
again
listen
young
lady
let
do
talk
about
that
just
yet
i
want
to
ask
you
you
understand
all
about
this
glue
business
i
expect
do
you
i
not
sure
i
only
know
let
me
tell
you
he
interrupted
impatiently
i
tell
you
all
about
it
in
two
words
the
process
belonged
to
me
and
your
father
up
and
walked
off
with
it
there
no
getting
around
that
much
is
there
alice
stared
at
him
i
think
you
mistaken
lamb
did
papa
improve
it
so
that
it
virtually
belonged
to
him
there
was
a
spark
in
the
old
blue
eyes
at
this
what
he
cried
is
that
the
way
he
got
around
it
why
in
all
my
life
i
never
heard
of
such
a
but
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
the
testiness
went
out
of
his
husky
voice
and
the
anger
out
of
his
eyes
well
i
expect
maybe
that
was
the
way
of
it
he
said
anyhow
it
right
for
you
to
stand
up
for
your
father
and
if
you
think
he
had
a
right
to
it
but
he
did
she
cried
i
expect
so
the
old
man
returned
pacifically
i
expect
so
probably
anyhow
it
a
question
that
neither
here
nor
there
right
now
what
i
was
thinking
of
saying
well
did
your
father
happen
to
let
out
that
he
and
i
had
words
this
morning
well
we
he
sighed
and
shook
his
head
your
father
well
he
used
some
pretty
hard
expressions
toward
me
young
lady
they
so
i
glad
to
say
but
he
used
to
me
and
the
worst
of
it
was
he
believed
well
i
been
thinking
it
over
and
i
thought
i
just
have
a
kind
of
little
talk
with
you
to
set
matters
straight
so
to
yes
for
instance
he
said
it
like
this
now
i
hope
you
wo
think
i
mean
any
indelicacy
but
you
take
your
brother
case
since
we
got
to
mention
it
why
your
father
had
the
whole
thing
worked
out
in
his
mind
about
as
wrong
as
anybody
ever
got
anything
if
i
acted
the
way
your
father
thought
i
did
about
that
why
somebody
just
ought
to
take
me
out
and
shoot
me
do
you
know
what
that
man
thought
i
not
he
frowned
at
her
and
asked
well
what
do
you
think
about
it
i
do
know
she
said
i
do
believe
i
think
anything
at
all
about
anything
well
well
he
returned
i
expect
not
i
expect
not
you
kind
of
look
to
me
as
if
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
yourself
young
oh
i
guess
you
mean
yes
and
i
wo
keep
you
long
but
something
we
got
to
get
fixed
up
and
i
rather
talk
to
you
than
i
would
to
your
mother
because
you
a
smart
girl
and
always
friendly
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
now
i
will
alice
promised
smiling
faintly
i
never
even
hardly
noticed
your
brother
was
still
working
for
me
he
explained
earnestly
i
never
thought
anything
about
it
my
sons
sort
of
tried
to
tease
me
about
the
way
your
father
about
his
taking
up
this
glue
business
so
to
speak
and
one
day
albert
junior
asked
me
if
i
felt
all
right
about
your
brother
staying
there
after
that
and
i
told
him
well
i
just
asked
him
to
shut
up
if
the
boy
wanted
to
stay
there
i
did
consider
it
my
business
to
send
him
away
on
account
of
any
feeling
i
had
toward
his
father
not
as
long
as
he
did
his
work
right
and
the
report
showed
he
did
well
as
it
happens
it
looks
now
as
if
he
stayed
because
he
had
to
he
could
quit
because
he
been
found
out
if
he
did
well
he
been
covering
up
his
shortage
for
a
considerable
time
and
do
you
know
what
your
father
practically
charged
me
with
about
that
no
in
his
resentment
the
old
gentleman
ruddy
face
became
ruddier
and
his
husky
voice
huskier
thinks
i
kept
the
boy
there
because
i
suspected
him
thinks
i
did
it
to
get
even
with
him
do
i
look
to
you
like
a
man
that
do
such
a
thing
no
she
said
gently
i
do
think
you
no
he
exclaimed
nor
he
would
think
so
if
he
was
himself
known
me
too
long
but
he
must
been
sort
of
brooding
over
this
whole
business
i
mean
before
walter
trouble
he
must
been
taking
it
to
heart
pretty
hard
for
some
time
back
he
thought
i
did
think
much
of
him
any
more
and
i
expect
he
maybe
wondered
some
what
i
was
going
to
do
and
there
nothing
that
state
of
mind
to
make
a
man
suspicious
of
all
kinds
of
meanness
well
he
practically
stood
up
there
and
accused
me
to
my
face
of
fixing
things
he
could
ever
raise
the
money
to
settle
for
walter
and
ask
us
not
to
prosecute
that
the
state
of
mind
your
father
brooding
got
him
into
young
lady
charging
me
with
a
trick
like
that
i
sorry
she
said
i
know
you
never
the
old
man
slapped
his
sturdy
knee
angrily
why
that
dang
fool
of
a
virgil
adams
he
exclaimed
he
would
even
give
me
a
chance
to
talk
and
he
got
me
so
mad
i
could
hardly
talk
anyway
he
might
known
from
the
first
i
was
going
to
let
him
walk
in
and
beat
me
out
of
my
own
that
is
he
might
known
i
would
let
him
get
ahead
of
me
in
a
business
matter
not
with
my
boys
twitting
me
about
it
every
few
minutes
but
to
talk
to
me
the
way
he
did
this
morning
well
he
was
out
of
his
head
that
all
now
wait
just
a
minute
he
interposed
as
she
seemed
about
to
speak
in
the
first
place
we
are
going
to
push
this
case
against
your
brother
i
believe
in
the
law
all
right
and
business
men
got
to
protect
themselves
but
in
a
case
like
this
where
restitution
made
by
the
family
why
i
expect
it
just
as
well
sometimes
to
use
a
little
influence
and
let
matters
drop
of
course
your
brother
have
to
keep
out
o
this
state
that
but
you
said
she
faltered
yes
what
i
say
you
said
restitution
made
by
the
family
that
what
seemed
to
trouble
papa
so
terribly
because
because
restitution
could
why
yes
it
could
that
what
i
here
to
talk
to
you
i
do
see
i
going
to
tell
you
ai
i
he
said
gruffly
just
hold
your
horses
a
minute
he
coughed
rose
from
his
chair
walked
up
and
down
the
room
then
halted
before
her
it
like
this
he
said
after
i
brought
your
father
home
this
morning
there
was
one
of
the
things
he
told
me
when
he
was
going
for
me
over
yonder
it
kind
of
stuck
in
my
craw
it
was
something
about
all
this
glue
controversy
not
meaning
anything
to
me
in
particular
and
meaning
a
whole
heap
to
him
and
his
family
well
he
was
wrong
about
that
two
ways
the
first
one
was
it
did
mean
a
good
deal
to
me
to
have
him
go
back
on
me
after
so
many
years
i
do
need
to
say
any
more
about
it
except
just
to
tell
you
it
meant
quite
a
little
more
to
me
than
you
think
maybe
the
other
way
he
was
wrong
is
that
how
much
a
thing
means
to
one
man
and
how
little
it
means
to
another
ai
the
right
way
to
look
at
a
business
i
suppose
it
is
no
he
said
it
is
it
not
the
right
way
to
look
at
anything
yes
and
your
father
knows
it
as
well
as
i
do
when
he
in
his
right
mind
and
i
expect
that
one
of
the
reasons
he
got
so
mad
at
me
but
anyhow
i
could
help
thinking
about
how
much
all
this
thing
had
maybe
meant
to
him
as
i
say
it
kind
of
stuck
in
my
craw
i
want
you
to
tell
him
something
from
me
and
i
want
you
to
go
and
tell
him
right
off
if
he
able
and
willing
to
listen
you
tell
him
i
got
kind
of
a
notion
he
was
pushed
into
this
thing
by
circumstances
and
tell
him
i
lived
long
enough
to
know
that
circumstances
can
beat
the
best
of
us
you
tell
him
i
said
best
of
us
tell
him
i
have
got
a
bit
of
feeling
against
him
not
any
more
and
tell
him
i
came
here
to
ask
him
not
to
have
any
against
yes
tell
him
i
said
the
old
man
paused
abruptly
and
alice
was
surprised
in
a
dull
and
tired
way
when
she
saw
that
his
lips
had
begun
to
twitch
and
his
eyelids
to
blink
but
he
recovered
himself
almost
at
once
and
continued
i
want
him
to
remember
us
our
transgressions
as
we
forgive
those
that
transgress
against
us
and
if
he
and
i
been
transgressing
against
each
other
why
tell
him
i
think
it
time
we
quit
such
foolishness
he
coughed
again
smiled
heartily
upon
her
and
walked
toward
the
door
then
turned
back
to
her
with
an
exclamation
well
if
i
ai
an
old
fool
what
is
it
she
asked
why
i
forgot
what
we
were
just
talking
about
your
father
wants
to
settle
for
walter
deficit
tell
him
we
be
glad
to
accept
it
but
of
course
we
do
expect
him
to
clean
the
matter
up
until
he
able
to
talk
business
alice
stared
at
him
blankly
enough
for
him
to
perceive
that
further
explanations
were
necessary
it
like
this
he
said
you
see
if
your
father
decided
to
keep
his
works
going
over
yonder
i
do
say
but
he
might
give
us
some
little
competition
for
a
time
as
got
the
start
on
us
and
about
ready
for
the
market
then
i
was
figuring
we
could
use
his
plant
it
small
but
it
be
to
our
benefit
to
have
the
use
of
it
and
he
got
a
lease
on
that
big
lot
it
may
come
in
handy
for
us
if
we
want
to
expand
some
well
i
prefer
to
make
a
deal
with
him
as
quietly
as
possible
good
in
every
tom
dick
and
harry
hearing
about
things
like
this
but
i
figured
he
could
sell
out
to
me
for
a
little
something
enough
to
cover
the
mortgage
he
put
on
this
house
and
walter
deficit
too
that
do
amount
to
much
in
dollars
and
cents
the
way
i
figure
it
i
could
offer
him
about
hundred
dollars
as
a
total
or
say
hundred
and
fifty
and
if
he
feels
like
accepting
why
i
send
a
confidential
man
up
here
with
the
papers
soon
your
father
able
to
look
over
you
tell
him
will
you
and
ask
him
if
he
sees
his
way
to
accepting
that
figure
yes
alice
said
and
now
her
own
lips
twitched
while
her
eyes
filled
so
that
she
saw
but
a
blurred
image
of
the
old
man
who
held
out
his
hand
in
parting
i
tell
him
thank
he
shook
her
hand
hastily
well
let
just
keep
it
kind
of
quiet
he
said
at
the
door
no
good
in
every
tom
dick
and
harry
knowing
all
what
goes
on
in
town
you
telephone
me
when
your
papa
ready
to
go
over
the
papers
and
call
me
up
at
my
house
will
you
let
me
hear
how
he
feeling
i
will
she
said
and
through
her
grateful
tears
gave
him
a
smile
almost
radiant
he
be
better
lamb
we
all
chapter
xxv
one
morning
that
autumn
adams
came
into
alice
room
and
found
her
completing
a
sober
toilet
for
the
street
moreover
the
expression
revealed
in
her
mirror
was
harmonious
with
the
severity
of
her
attire
what
makes
you
look
so
cross
dearie
the
mother
asked
could
you
find
anything
nicer
to
wear
than
that
plain
old
dark
dress
i
do
believe
i
cross
the
girl
said
absently
i
believe
just
thinking
is
it
about
time
time
for
what
time
for
thinking
for
me
i
mean
disregarding
this
adams
looked
her
over
thoughtfully
i
ca
see
why
you
do
wear
more
colour
she
said
at
your
age
it
becoming
and
proper
too
anyhow
when
you
going
on
the
street
i
think
you
ought
to
look
just
as
gay
and
lively
as
you
can
manage
you
want
to
show
you
got
some
spunk
how
do
you
mean
mama
i
mean
about
walter
running
away
and
the
mess
your
father
made
of
his
business
it
would
help
to
show
you
holding
up
your
head
just
the
show
whom
all
these
other
girls
that
not
i
alice
laughed
shortly
shaking
her
head
i
quit
dressing
at
them
and
if
they
saw
me
they
would
think
what
you
want
to
funny
but
we
do
often
make
people
think
what
we
want
to
mama
you
do
thus
and
so
and
you
tell
yourself
seeing
me
do
thus
and
so
people
will
naturally
think
this
and
that
but
they
do
they
think
something
else
usually
just
what
you
do
want
to
i
suppose
about
the
only
good
in
pretending
is
the
fun
we
get
out
of
fooling
ourselves
that
we
fool
well
but
it
would
be
pretending
you
ought
to
let
people
see
still
holding
your
head
up
because
you
are
you
would
want
that
mildred
palmer
to
think
you
cast
down
about
well
you
know
you
would
want
her
not
to
think
you
holding
your
head
up
would
you
she
would
know
whether
i
am
or
not
alice
bit
her
lip
then
smiled
faintly
as
she
said
anyhow
i
not
thinking
about
my
head
in
that
way
not
this
morning
i
adams
dropped
the
subject
casually
are
you
going
she
inquired
what
for
just
something
i
want
to
see
about
i
tell
you
when
i
come
back
anything
you
want
me
to
do
no
i
guess
not
i
thought
you
might
look
for
a
rug
but
rather
go
with
you
to
select
it
we
have
to
get
a
new
rug
for
your
father
room
i
i
glad
you
think
so
mama
i
do
suppose
he
ever
even
noticed
it
but
that
old
rug
of
his
well
really
i
did
mean
for
him
her
mother
explained
thoughtfully
no
he
do
mind
it
and
he
likely
make
a
fuss
if
we
changed
it
on
his
account
no
what
i
meant
we
have
to
put
your
father
in
room
he
wo
mind
i
do
expect
not
no
i
suppose
not
alice
agreed
rather
sadly
i
heard
the
bell
awhile
ago
was
it
somebody
about
that
yes
just
before
i
came
upstairs
lohr
gave
him
a
note
to
me
and
he
was
really
a
very
young
man
a
very
young
man
adams
repeated
with
increased
animation
and
a
thoughtful
glance
at
her
daughter
he
a
will
dickson
he
has
a
position
with
the
gas
works
lohr
says
and
he
fully
able
to
afford
a
nice
room
so
if
you
and
i
double
up
in
here
then
with
that
young
married
couple
in
my
room
and
this
dickson
in
your
father
we
just
about
have
things
settled
i
thought
maybe
i
could
make
one
more
place
at
table
too
so
that
with
the
other
people
from
outside
we
be
serving
eleven
altogether
you
see
if
i
have
to
pay
this
cook
twelve
dollars
a
week
it
ca
be
helped
i
guess
well
one
more
would
certainly
help
toward
a
profit
of
course
it
a
terribly
worrying
thing
to
see
how
we
will
come
out
do
you
suppose
we
could
squeeze
in
one
more
i
suppose
it
could
be
managed
adams
brightened
i
sure
it
be
pleasant
having
that
young
married
couple
in
the
house
and
especially
this
will
dickson
he
seemed
very
much
of
a
gentleman
and
anxious
to
get
settled
in
good
surroundings
i
was
very
favourably
impressed
with
him
in
every
way
and
he
explained
to
me
about
his
name
it
seems
it
is
william
it
just
his
parents
had
him
christened
that
way
it
she
paused
and
then
with
an
effort
to
seem
casual
which
veiled
nothing
from
her
daughter
it
quite
curious
she
said
again
but
rather
attractive
and
different
do
you
think
poor
mama
alice
laughed
compassionately
poor
mama
he
is
though
adams
maintained
he
very
much
of
a
gentleman
unless
i
no
judge
of
appearances
and
it
really
be
nice
to
have
him
in
the
no
doubt
alice
said
as
she
opened
her
door
to
depart
i
suppose
we
mind
having
any
of
as
much
as
we
thought
we
would
but
her
mother
detained
her
catching
her
by
the
arm
alice
you
do
hate
it
do
you
no
the
girl
said
quickly
there
was
anything
else
to
adams
became
emotional
at
once
her
face
cried
tragedy
and
her
voice
misfortune
there
might
have
been
something
else
to
do
oh
alice
you
gave
your
father
bad
advice
when
you
upheld
him
in
taking
a
miserable
little
hundred
and
fifty
from
that
old
wretch
if
your
father
just
had
the
gumption
to
hold
out
they
have
had
to
pay
him
anything
he
asked
if
he
just
had
the
gumption
and
a
little
manly
courage
hush
alice
whispered
for
her
mother
voice
grew
louder
hush
he
hear
you
could
he
hear
me
too
often
the
embittered
lady
asked
if
listened
to
me
at
the
right
time
would
we
have
to
be
taking
in
boarders
and
sinking
down
in
the
scale
at
the
end
of
our
lives
instead
of
going
up
you
were
both
wrong
we
did
need
to
be
so
panicky
that
was
just
what
that
old
man
wanted
to
scare
us
and
buy
us
out
for
nothing
if
your
father
just
listened
to
me
then
or
if
for
once
in
his
life
just
been
half
a
man
alice
put
her
hand
over
her
mother
mouth
you
must
he
will
hear
you
but
from
the
other
side
of
adams
closed
door
his
voice
came
querulously
oh
i
hear
her
all
right
you
see
mama
alice
said
and
as
adams
turned
away
weeping
the
daughter
sighed
then
went
in
to
speak
to
her
father
he
was
in
his
old
chair
by
the
table
with
a
pillow
behind
his
head
but
the
crocheted
scarf
and
adams
wrapper
swathed
him
no
more
he
wore
a
his
wife
had
bought
for
him
and
was
smoking
his
pipe
the
old
story
is
it
he
said
as
alice
came
in
the
same
same
old
story
well
well
has
she
gone
yes
got
your
hat
on
he
said
where
you
going
i
going
on
an
errand
of
my
own
is
there
anything
you
want
papa
yes
there
he
smiled
at
her
i
wish
you
sit
down
a
while
and
talk
to
me
unless
your
errand
no
she
said
taking
a
chair
near
him
i
was
just
going
down
to
see
about
some
arrangements
i
was
making
for
myself
there
no
what
arrangements
for
yourself
dearie
i
tell
you
afterwards
after
i
find
out
something
about
all
right
he
said
indulgently
keep
your
secrets
keep
your
he
paused
drew
musingly
upon
his
pipe
and
shook
his
head
funny
the
way
your
mother
looks
at
things
for
the
matter
o
that
everything
pretty
funny
i
expect
if
you
stop
to
think
about
it
for
instance
let
her
say
all
she
likes
but
we
were
pushed
right
spang
to
the
wall
if
j
lamb
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
make
that
offer
for
the
works
and
there
one
of
the
things
i
been
thinking
about
lately
alice
thinking
about
how
funny
they
work
what
did
you
think
about
it
papa
well
i
seen
it
happen
in
other
people
lives
time
and
time
again
and
now
it
happened
in
ours
you
think
you
going
to
be
pushed
right
up
against
the
wall
you
ca
see
any
way
out
or
any
hope
at
all
you
think
you
gone
and
then
something
you
never
counted
on
turns
up
and
while
maybe
you
never
do
get
back
to
where
you
used
to
be
yet
somehow
you
kind
of
squirm
out
of
being
right
spang
against
the
wall
you
keep
on
going
maybe
you
ca
go
much
but
you
do
go
a
little
see
what
i
mean
yes
i
understand
yes
i
afraid
you
do
he
said
too
bad
you
ought
to
understand
it
at
your
age
it
seems
to
me
a
good
deal
as
if
the
lord
really
meant
for
the
young
people
to
have
the
good
times
and
for
the
old
to
have
the
troubles
and
when
anybody
as
young
as
you
has
trouble
there
a
big
mistake
oh
no
she
protested
but
he
persisted
whimsically
in
this
view
of
divine
error
yes
it
does
look
a
good
deal
that
way
but
of
course
we
ca
tell
we
never
certain
about
anything
not
about
anything
at
all
sometimes
i
look
at
it
another
way
though
sometimes
it
looks
to
me
as
if
a
body
troubles
came
on
him
mainly
because
he
had
had
sense
enough
to
know
how
not
to
have
any
as
if
his
troubles
were
kind
of
like
a
boy
getting
kept
in
after
school
by
the
teacher
to
give
him
discipline
or
something
or
other
but
my
my
we
do
learn
easy
he
chuckled
mournfully
not
to
learn
how
to
live
till
we
about
ready
to
die
it
certainly
seems
to
me
dang
tough
then
i
would
brood
on
such
a
notion
papa
she
said
no
he
returned
i
just
kind
o
mull
it
he
chuckled
again
sighed
and
then
not
looking
at
her
he
said
that
russell
your
mother
tells
me
he
has
been
here
again
not
since
no
she
said
quietly
as
adams
paused
he
never
came
well
but
maybe
no
she
said
there
is
any
i
told
him
that
night
papa
it
was
before
he
knew
about
walter
i
told
well
well
adams
said
young
people
are
entitled
to
their
own
privacy
i
do
want
to
he
emptied
his
pipe
into
a
chipped
saucer
on
the
table
beside
him
laid
the
pipe
aside
and
reverted
to
a
former
topic
speaking
of
dying
well
but
we
were
alice
protested
yes
about
not
knowing
how
to
live
till
you
through
living
and
then
maybe
not
he
said
chuckling
at
his
own
determined
pessimism
i
see
i
pretty
old
because
i
talk
this
way
i
remember
my
grandmother
saying
things
a
good
deal
like
all
what
i
saying
now
i
used
to
hear
her
at
it
when
i
was
a
young
fellow
she
was
a
right
gloomy
old
lady
i
remember
well
anyhow
it
reminds
me
i
want
to
get
on
my
feet
again
as
soon
as
i
can
i
got
to
look
around
and
find
something
to
go
alice
shook
her
head
gently
but
papa
he
told
you
never
mind
throwing
that
dang
doctor
up
at
me
adams
interrupted
peevishly
he
said
i
be
good
for
some
kind
of
light
job
if
i
could
find
just
the
right
thing
there
would
be
either
any
physical
or
mental
strain
he
said
well
i
got
to
find
something
like
that
anyway
i
feel
better
if
i
can
just
get
out
looking
for
but
papa
i
afraid
you
wo
find
it
and
you
be
well
i
want
to
hunt
around
and
see
alice
patted
his
hand
you
must
just
be
contented
papa
going
to
be
all
right
and
you
must
get
to
worrying
about
doing
anything
we
own
this
house
it
all
clear
and
you
taken
care
of
mama
and
me
all
our
lives
now
it
our
no
sir
he
said
querulously
i
do
like
the
idea
of
being
the
landlady
husband
around
a
it
goes
against
my
gizzard
know
makes
out
the
bills
for
his
wife
sunday
mornings
works
with
a
on
somebody
bureau
drawer
sometimes
the
furnace
maybe
one
the
boarders
gives
him
a
cigar
now
and
then
that
a
fine
life
to
look
forward
to
no
sir
i
do
want
to
finish
as
a
husband
alice
looked
grave
for
she
knew
the
sketch
was
but
too
accurately
prophetic
in
every
probability
but
papa
she
said
to
console
him
do
you
think
maybe
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
after
all
you
say
perhaps
we
do
learn
to
live
till
we
die
but
maybe
how
it
is
after
we
die
too
just
learning
some
more
the
way
we
do
here
and
maybe
through
trouble
again
even
after
oh
it
might
be
he
sighed
i
expect
well
then
she
said
what
the
use
of
talking
about
a
we
do
keep
looking
ahead
to
things
as
if
they
finish
something
but
when
we
get
to
them
they
do
finish
anything
they
just
part
of
going
on
i
tell
you
i
looked
ahead
all
summer
to
something
i
was
afraid
of
and
i
said
to
myself
if
that
happens
i
finished
but
it
was
so
papa
it
did
happen
and
nothing
finished
i
going
on
just
the
same
only
she
stopped
and
blushed
only
what
he
asked
well
she
blushed
more
deeply
then
jumped
up
and
standing
before
him
caught
both
his
hands
in
hers
well
do
you
think
since
we
do
have
to
go
on
we
ought
at
least
to
have
learned
some
sense
about
how
to
do
it
he
looked
up
at
her
adoringly
what
think
he
said
and
his
voice
trembled
i
think
the
smartest
girl
in
the
world
i
would
trade
you
for
the
whole
of
but
as
this
folly
of
his
threatened
to
make
her
tearful
she
kissed
him
hastily
and
went
forth
upon
her
errand
since
the
night
of
the
dinner
she
had
not
seen
russell
nor
caught
even
the
remotest
chance
glimpse
of
him
and
it
was
curious
that
she
should
encounter
him
as
she
went
upon
such
an
errand
as
now
engaged
her
at
a
corner
not
far
from
that
tobacconist
shop
she
had
just
left
when
he
overtook
her
and
walked
with
her
for
the
first
time
she
met
him
he
turned
the
corner
coming
toward
her
and
they
were
face
to
face
whereupon
that
engaging
face
of
russell
was
instantly
reddened
but
alice
remained
serene
she
stopped
short
though
and
so
did
he
then
she
smiled
brightly
as
she
put
out
her
hand
why
russell
i
so
i
so
glad
to
have
this
this
chance
he
stammered
wanted
to
tell
you
it
just
that
going
into
a
new
undertaking
this
business
life
one
does
get
to
do
a
great
many
things
he
like
to
i
hope
you
let
me
call
again
some
time
if
i
yes
do
she
said
cordially
and
then
with
a
quick
nod
went
briskly
on
she
breathed
more
rapidly
but
knew
that
he
could
not
have
detected
it
and
she
took
some
pride
in
herself
for
the
way
she
had
met
this
little
crisis
but
to
have
met
it
with
such
easy
courage
meant
to
her
something
more
reassuring
than
a
momentary
pride
in
the
serenity
she
had
shown
for
she
found
that
what
she
had
resolved
in
her
inmost
heart
was
now
really
true
she
was
through
with
all
that
she
walked
on
but
more
slowly
for
the
tobacconist
shop
was
not
far
from
her
now
and
beyond
it
that
portal
of
doom
frincke
business
college
already
alice
could
read
the
begrimed
gilt
letters
of
the
sign
and
although
they
had
spelled
destiny
never
with
a
more
painful
imminence
than
just
then
an
old
habit
of
dramatizing
herself
still
prevailed
with
her
there
came
into
her
mind
a
whimsical
comparison
of
her
fate
with
that
of
the
heroine
in
a
french
romance
she
had
read
long
ago
and
remembered
well
for
she
had
cried
over
it
the
story
ended
with
the
taking
the
veil
after
a
death
blow
to
love
and
the
final
scene
again
became
vivid
to
alice
for
a
moment
again
as
when
she
had
read
and
wept
she
seemed
herself
to
stand
among
the
great
shadows
in
the
cathedral
nave
smelled
the
smoky
incense
on
the
enclosed
air
and
heard
the
solemn
pulses
of
the
organ
she
remembered
how
the
novice
father
knelt
trembling
beside
a
pillar
of
gray
stone
how
the
faithless
lover
watched
and
shivered
behind
the
statue
of
a
saint
how
stifled
sobs
and
outcries
were
heard
when
the
novice
came
to
the
altar
and
how
a
shaft
of
light
struck
through
the
enveloping
her
in
an
amber
glow
it
was
the
vision
of
a
moment
only
and
for
no
longer
than
a
moment
did
alice
tell
herself
that
the
romance
provided
a
prettier
way
of
taking
the
veil
than
she
had
chosen
and
that
a
faithless
lover
shaking
with
remorse
behind
a
saint
statue
was
a
greater
solace
than
one
left
on
a
street
corner
protesting
that
he
like
to
call
some
time
if
he
could
her
pity
for
herself
vanished
more
reluctantly
but
she
shook
it
off
and
tried
to
smile
at
it
and
at
her
romantic
recollections
at
all
of
them
she
had
something
important
to
think
of
she
passed
the
tobacconist
and
before
her
was
that
dark
entrance
to
the
wooden
stairway
leading
up
to
frincke
business
college
the
very
doorway
she
had
always
looked
upon
as
the
end
of
youth
and
the
end
of
hope
how
often
she
had
gone
by
here
hating
the
dreary
obscurity
of
that
stairway
how
often
she
had
thought
of
this
obscurity
as
something
lying
in
wait
to
obliterate
the
footsteps
of
any
girl
who
should
ascend
into
the
smoky
darkness
above
never
had
she
passed
without
those
ominous
imaginings
of
hers
pretty
girls
turning
into
old
maids
taking
dictation
old
maids
of
a
dozen
different
types
yet
all
looking
a
little
like
herself
well
she
was
here
at
last
she
looked
up
and
down
the
street
quickly
and
then
with
a
little
heave
of
the
shoulders
she
went
bravely
in
under
the
sign
and
began
to
climb
the
wooden
steps
up
the
shadows
were
heaviest
but
after
that
the
place
began
to
seem
brighter
there
was
an
open
window
overhead
somewhere
she
found
and
the
steps
at
the
top
were
gay
with
sunshine
