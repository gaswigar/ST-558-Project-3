how
it
is
useless
to
seek
even
on
the
best
maps
for
the
small
town
of
quiquendone
if
you
try
to
find
on
any
map
of
flanders
ancient
or
modern
the
small
town
of
quiquendone
probably
you
will
not
succeed
is
quiquendone
then
one
of
those
towns
which
have
disappeared
no
a
town
of
the
future
by
no
means
it
exists
in
spite
of
geographies
and
has
done
so
for
some
eight
or
nine
hundred
years
it
even
numbers
two
thousand
three
hundred
and
souls
allowing
one
soul
to
each
inhabitant
it
is
situated
thirteen
and
a
half
kilometres
of
oudenarde
and
fifteen
and
a
quarter
kilometres
of
bruges
in
the
heart
of
flanders
the
vaar
a
small
tributary
of
the
scheldt
passes
beneath
its
three
bridges
which
are
still
covered
with
a
quaint
mediæval
roof
like
that
at
tournay
an
old
château
is
to
be
seen
there
the
first
stone
of
which
was
laid
so
long
ago
as
by
count
baldwin
afterwards
emperor
of
constantinople
and
there
is
a
town
hall
with
gothic
windows
crowned
by
a
chaplet
of
battlements
and
surrounded
by
a
turreted
belfry
which
rises
three
hundred
and
feet
above
the
soil
every
hour
you
may
hear
there
a
chime
of
five
octaves
a
veritable
aerial
piano
the
renown
of
which
surpasses
that
of
the
famous
chimes
of
bruges
strangers
if
any
ever
come
to
quiquendone
do
not
quit
the
curious
old
town
until
they
have
visited
its
hall
adorned
by
a
portrait
of
william
of
nassau
by
brandon
the
loft
of
the
church
of
saint
magloire
a
masterpiece
of
sixteenth
century
architecture
the
well
in
the
spacious
place
saint
ernuph
the
admirable
ornamentation
of
which
is
attributed
to
the
quentin
metsys
the
tomb
formerly
erected
to
mary
of
burgundy
daughter
of
charles
the
bold
who
now
reposes
in
the
church
of
notre
dame
at
bruges
and
so
on
the
principal
industry
of
quiquendone
is
the
manufacture
of
whipped
creams
and
on
a
large
scale
it
has
been
governed
by
the
van
tricasses
from
father
to
son
for
several
centuries
and
yet
quiquendone
is
not
on
the
map
of
flanders
have
the
geographers
forgotten
it
or
is
it
an
intentional
omission
that
i
can
not
tell
but
quiquendone
really
exists
with
its
narrow
streets
its
fortified
walls
its
houses
its
market
and
its
burgomaster
so
much
so
that
it
has
recently
been
the
theatre
of
some
surprising
phenomena
as
extraordinary
and
incredible
as
they
are
true
which
are
to
be
recounted
in
the
present
narration
surely
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
or
thought
against
the
flemings
of
western
flanders
they
are
a
folk
wise
prudent
sociable
with
even
tempers
hospitable
perhaps
a
little
heavy
in
conversation
as
in
mind
but
this
does
not
explain
why
one
of
the
most
interesting
towns
of
their
district
has
yet
to
appear
on
modern
maps
this
omission
is
certainly
to
be
regretted
if
only
history
or
in
default
of
history
the
chronicles
or
in
default
of
chronicles
the
traditions
of
the
country
made
mention
of
quiquendone
but
no
neither
atlases
guides
nor
itineraries
speak
of
it
joanne
himself
that
energetic
hunter
after
small
towns
says
not
a
word
of
it
it
might
be
readily
conceived
that
this
silence
would
injure
the
commerce
the
industries
of
the
town
but
let
us
hasten
to
add
that
quiquendone
has
neither
industry
nor
commerce
and
that
it
does
very
well
without
them
its
and
whipped
cream
are
consumed
on
the
spot
none
is
exported
in
short
the
quiquendonians
have
no
need
of
anybody
their
desires
are
limited
their
existence
is
a
modest
one
they
are
calm
moderate
phlegmatic
in
a
word
they
are
flemings
such
as
are
still
to
be
met
with
sometimes
between
the
scheldt
and
the
north
sea
chapter
ii
in
which
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
and
the
counsellor
niklausse
consult
about
the
affairs
of
the
town
you
think
so
asked
the
burgomaster
i
think
so
replied
the
counsellor
after
some
minutes
of
silence
you
see
we
must
not
act
hastily
resumed
the
burgomaster
we
have
been
talking
over
this
grave
matter
for
ten
years
replied
the
counsellor
niklausse
and
i
confess
to
you
my
worthy
van
tricasse
that
i
can
not
yet
take
it
upon
myself
to
come
to
a
decision
i
quite
understand
your
hesitation
said
the
burgomaster
who
did
not
speak
until
after
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
of
reflection
i
quite
understand
it
and
i
fully
share
it
we
shall
do
wisely
to
decide
upon
nothing
without
a
more
careful
examination
of
the
question
it
is
certain
replied
niklausse
that
this
post
of
civil
commissary
is
useless
in
so
peaceful
a
town
as
quiquendone
our
predecessor
said
van
tricasse
gravely
our
predecessor
never
said
never
would
have
dared
to
say
that
anything
is
certain
every
affirmation
is
subject
to
awkward
qualifications
the
counsellor
nodded
his
head
slowly
in
token
of
assent
then
he
remained
silent
for
nearly
half
an
hour
after
this
lapse
of
time
during
which
neither
the
counsellor
nor
the
burgomaster
moved
so
much
as
a
finger
niklausse
asked
van
tricasse
whether
his
predecessor
of
some
twenty
years
before
had
not
thought
of
suppressing
this
office
of
civil
commissary
which
each
year
cost
the
town
of
quiquendone
the
sum
of
thirteen
hundred
and
francs
and
some
centimes
i
believe
he
did
replied
the
burgomaster
carrying
his
hand
with
majestic
deliberation
to
his
ample
brow
but
the
worthy
man
died
without
having
dared
to
make
up
his
mind
either
as
to
this
or
any
other
administrative
measure
he
was
a
sage
why
should
i
not
do
as
he
did
counsellor
niklausse
was
incapable
of
originating
any
objection
to
the
burgomaster
opinion
the
man
who
dies
added
van
tricasse
solemnly
without
ever
having
decided
upon
anything
during
his
life
has
very
nearly
attained
to
perfection
this
said
the
burgomaster
pressed
a
bell
with
the
end
of
his
little
finger
which
gave
forth
a
muffled
sound
which
seemed
less
a
sound
than
a
sigh
presently
some
light
steps
glided
softly
across
the
tile
floor
a
mouse
would
not
have
made
less
noise
running
over
a
thick
carpet
the
door
of
the
room
opened
turning
on
its
hinges
a
young
girl
with
long
blonde
tresses
made
her
appearance
it
was
suzel
van
tricasse
the
burgomaster
only
daughter
she
handed
her
father
a
pipe
filled
to
the
brim
and
a
small
copper
brazier
spoke
not
a
word
and
disappeared
at
once
making
no
more
noise
at
her
exit
than
at
her
entrance
illustration
she
handed
her
father
a
pipe
the
worthy
burgomaster
lighted
his
pipe
and
was
soon
hidden
in
a
cloud
of
bluish
smoke
leaving
counsellor
niklausse
plunged
in
the
most
absorbing
thought
the
room
in
which
these
two
notable
personages
charged
with
the
government
of
quiquendone
were
talking
was
a
parlour
richly
adorned
with
carvings
in
dark
wood
a
lofty
fireplace
in
which
an
oak
might
have
been
burned
or
an
ox
roasted
occupied
the
whole
of
one
of
the
sides
of
the
room
opposite
to
it
was
a
trellised
window
the
painted
glass
of
which
toned
down
the
brightness
of
the
sunbeams
in
an
antique
frame
above
the
appeared
the
portrait
of
some
worthy
man
attributed
to
memling
which
no
doubt
represented
an
ancestor
of
the
van
tricasses
whose
authentic
genealogy
dates
back
to
the
fourteenth
century
the
period
when
the
flemings
and
guy
de
dampierre
were
engaged
in
wars
with
the
emperor
rudolph
of
hapsburgh
this
parlour
was
the
principal
apartment
of
the
house
which
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
in
quiquendone
built
in
the
flemish
style
with
all
the
abruptness
quaintness
and
picturesqueness
of
pointed
architecture
it
was
considered
one
of
the
most
curious
monuments
of
the
town
a
carthusian
convent
or
a
deaf
and
dumb
asylum
was
not
more
silent
than
this
mansion
noise
had
no
existence
there
people
did
not
walk
but
glided
about
in
it
they
did
not
speak
they
murmured
there
was
not
however
any
lack
of
women
in
the
house
which
in
addition
to
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
himself
sheltered
his
wife
madame
brigitte
van
tricasse
his
daughter
suzel
van
tricasse
and
his
domestic
lotchè
janshéu
we
may
also
mention
the
sister
aunt
hermance
an
elderly
maiden
who
still
bore
the
nickname
of
tatanémance
which
her
niece
suzel
had
given
her
when
a
child
but
in
spite
of
all
these
elements
of
discord
and
noise
the
burgomaster
house
was
as
calm
as
a
desert
the
burgomaster
was
some
fifty
years
old
neither
fat
nor
lean
neither
short
nor
tall
neither
rubicund
nor
pale
neither
gay
nor
sad
neither
contented
nor
discontented
neither
energetic
nor
dull
neither
proud
nor
humble
neither
good
nor
bad
neither
generous
nor
miserly
neither
courageous
nor
cowardly
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
of
anything
a
man
notably
moderate
in
all
respects
whose
invariable
slowness
of
motion
slightly
hanging
lower
jaw
prominent
eyebrows
massive
forehead
smooth
as
a
copper
plate
and
without
a
wrinkle
would
at
once
have
betrayed
to
a
physiognomist
that
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
was
phlegm
personified
never
either
from
anger
or
passion
had
any
emotion
whatever
hastened
the
beating
of
this
man
heart
or
flushed
his
face
never
had
his
pupils
contracted
under
the
influence
of
any
irritation
however
ephemeral
he
invariably
wore
good
clothes
neither
too
large
nor
too
small
which
he
never
seemed
to
wear
out
he
was
shod
with
large
square
shoes
with
triple
soles
and
silver
buckles
which
lasted
so
long
that
his
shoemaker
was
in
despair
upon
his
head
he
wore
a
large
hat
which
dated
from
the
period
when
flanders
was
separated
from
holland
so
that
this
venerable
masterpiece
was
at
least
forty
years
old
but
what
would
you
have
it
is
the
passions
which
wear
out
body
as
well
as
soul
the
clothes
as
well
as
the
body
and
our
worthy
burgomaster
apathetic
indolent
indifferent
was
passionate
in
nothing
he
wore
nothing
out
not
even
himself
and
he
considered
himself
the
very
man
to
administer
the
affairs
of
quiquendone
and
its
tranquil
population
the
town
indeed
was
not
less
calm
than
the
van
tricasse
mansion
it
was
in
this
peaceful
dwelling
that
the
burgomaster
reckoned
on
attaining
the
utmost
limit
of
human
existence
after
having
however
seen
the
good
madame
brigitte
van
tricasse
his
wife
precede
him
to
the
tomb
where
surely
she
would
not
find
a
more
profound
repose
than
that
she
had
enjoyed
on
earth
for
sixty
years
this
demands
explanation
the
van
tricasse
family
might
well
call
itself
the
jeannot
family
this
is
why
every
one
knows
that
the
knife
of
this
typical
personage
is
as
celebrated
as
its
proprietor
and
not
less
incapable
of
wearing
out
thanks
to
the
double
operation
incessantly
repeated
of
replacing
the
handle
when
it
is
worn
out
and
the
blade
when
it
becomes
worthless
a
precisely
similar
operation
had
been
going
on
from
time
immemorial
in
the
van
tricasse
family
to
which
nature
had
lent
herself
with
more
than
usual
complacency
from
it
had
invariably
happened
that
a
van
tricasse
when
left
a
widower
had
remarried
a
van
tricasse
younger
than
himself
who
becoming
in
turn
a
widow
had
married
again
a
van
tricasse
younger
than
herself
and
so
on
without
a
break
in
the
continuity
from
generation
to
generation
each
died
in
his
or
her
turn
with
mechanical
regularity
thus
the
worthy
madame
brigitte
van
tricasse
had
now
her
second
husband
and
unless
she
violated
her
every
duty
would
precede
her
spouse
he
being
ten
years
younger
than
herself
to
the
other
world
to
make
room
for
a
new
madame
van
tricasse
upon
this
the
burgomaster
calmly
counted
that
the
family
tradition
might
not
be
broken
such
was
this
mansion
peaceful
and
silent
of
which
the
doors
never
creaked
the
windows
never
rattled
the
floors
never
groaned
the
chimneys
never
roared
the
weathercocks
never
grated
the
furniture
never
squeaked
the
locks
never
clanked
and
the
occupants
never
made
more
noise
than
their
shadows
the
god
harpocrates
would
certainly
have
chosen
it
for
the
temple
of
silence
illustration
the
worthy
madame
brigitte
van
tricasse
had
now
her
second
husband
chapter
iii
in
which
the
commissary
passauf
enters
as
noisily
as
unexpectedly
when
the
interesting
conversation
which
has
been
narrated
began
it
was
a
quarter
before
three
in
the
afternoon
it
was
at
a
quarter
before
four
that
van
tricasse
lighted
his
enormous
pipe
which
could
hold
a
quart
of
tobacco
and
it
was
at
minutes
past
five
that
he
finished
smoking
it
all
this
time
the
two
comrades
did
not
exchange
a
single
word
about
six
the
counsellor
who
had
a
habit
of
speaking
in
a
very
summary
manner
resumed
in
these
words
so
we
decide
to
decide
nothing
replied
the
burgomaster
i
think
on
the
whole
that
you
are
right
van
tricasse
i
think
so
too
niklausse
we
will
take
steps
with
reference
to
the
civil
commissary
when
we
have
more
light
on
the
subject
later
on
there
is
no
need
for
a
month
yet
nor
even
for
a
year
replied
niklausse
unfolding
his
and
calmly
applying
it
to
his
nose
there
was
another
silence
of
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
nothing
disturbed
this
repeated
pause
in
the
conversation
not
even
the
appearance
of
the
lento
who
not
less
phlegmatic
than
his
master
came
to
pay
his
respects
in
the
parlour
noble
dog
a
model
for
his
race
had
he
been
made
of
pasteboard
with
wheels
on
his
paws
he
would
not
have
made
less
noise
during
his
stay
towards
eight
after
lotchè
had
brought
the
antique
lamp
of
polished
glass
the
burgomaster
said
to
the
counsellor
we
have
no
other
urgent
matter
to
consider
no
van
tricasse
none
that
i
know
of
have
i
not
been
told
though
asked
the
burgomaster
that
the
tower
of
the
oudenarde
gate
is
likely
to
tumble
down
ah
replied
the
counsellor
really
i
should
not
be
astonished
if
it
fell
on
some
any
day
oh
before
such
a
misfortune
happens
i
hope
we
shall
have
come
to
a
decision
on
the
subject
of
this
tower
i
hope
so
van
tricasse
there
are
more
pressing
matters
to
decide
no
doubt
the
question
of
the
for
instance
what
is
it
still
burning
still
burning
and
has
been
for
the
last
three
weeks
have
we
not
decided
in
council
to
let
it
burn
yes
van
tricasse
on
your
motion
was
not
that
the
surest
and
simplest
way
to
deal
with
it
without
doubt
well
let
us
wait
is
that
all
all
replied
the
counsellor
scratching
his
head
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
he
had
not
forgotten
anything
important
ah
exclaimed
the
burgomaster
have
you
also
heard
something
of
an
escape
of
water
which
threatens
to
inundate
the
low
quarter
of
saint
jacques
i
have
it
is
indeed
unfortunate
that
this
escape
of
water
did
not
happen
above
the
it
would
naturally
have
checked
the
fire
and
would
thus
have
saved
us
a
good
deal
of
discussion
what
can
you
expect
niklausse
there
is
nothing
so
illogical
as
accidents
they
are
bound
by
no
rules
and
we
can
not
profit
by
one
as
we
might
wish
to
remedy
another
it
took
van
tricasse
companion
some
time
to
digest
this
fine
observation
well
but
resumed
the
counsellor
niklausse
after
the
lapse
of
some
moments
we
have
not
spoken
of
our
great
affair
what
great
affair
have
we
then
a
great
affair
asked
the
burgomaster
no
doubt
about
lighting
the
town
o
yes
if
my
memory
serves
me
you
are
referring
to
the
lighting
plan
of
doctor
ox
precisely
it
is
going
on
niklausse
replied
the
burgomaster
they
are
already
laying
the
pipes
and
the
works
are
entirely
completed
perhaps
we
have
hurried
a
little
in
this
matter
said
the
counsellor
shaking
his
head
perhaps
but
our
excuse
is
that
doctor
ox
bears
the
whole
expense
of
his
experiment
it
will
not
cost
us
a
sou
that
true
enough
is
our
excuse
moreover
we
must
advance
with
the
age
if
the
experiment
succeeds
quiquendone
will
be
the
first
town
in
flanders
to
be
lighted
with
the
oxy
what
is
the
gas
called
oxyhydric
gas
well
oxyhydric
gas
then
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
lotchè
came
in
to
tell
the
burgomaster
that
his
supper
was
ready
counsellor
niklausse
rose
to
take
leave
of
van
tricasse
whose
appetite
had
been
stimulated
by
so
many
affairs
discussed
and
decisions
taken
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
council
of
notables
should
be
convened
after
a
reasonably
long
delay
to
determine
whether
a
decision
should
be
provisionally
arrived
at
with
reference
to
the
really
urgent
matter
of
the
oudenarde
gate
the
two
worthy
administrators
then
directed
their
steps
towards
the
the
one
conducting
the
other
the
counsellor
having
reached
the
last
step
lighted
a
little
lantern
to
guide
him
through
the
obscure
streets
of
quiquendone
which
doctor
ox
had
not
yet
lighted
it
was
a
dark
october
night
and
a
light
fog
overshadowed
the
town
niklausse
preparations
for
departure
consumed
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
after
having
lighted
his
lantern
he
had
to
put
on
his
big
socks
and
his
gloves
then
he
put
up
the
furred
collar
of
his
overcoat
turned
the
brim
of
his
felt
hat
down
over
his
eyes
grasped
his
heavy
umbrella
and
got
ready
to
start
when
lotchè
however
who
was
lighting
her
master
was
about
to
draw
the
bars
of
the
door
an
unexpected
noise
arose
outside
yes
strange
as
the
thing
seems
a
noise
a
real
noise
such
as
the
town
had
certainly
not
heard
since
the
taking
of
the
donjon
by
the
spaniards
in
terrible
noise
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
venerable
van
tricasse
mansion
some
one
knocked
heavily
upon
this
door
hitherto
virgin
to
brutal
touch
redoubled
knocks
were
given
with
some
blunt
implement
probably
a
knotty
stick
wielded
by
a
vigorous
arm
with
the
strokes
were
mingled
cries
and
calls
these
words
were
distinctly
heard
monsieur
van
tricasse
monsieur
the
burgomaster
open
open
quickly
the
burgomaster
and
the
counsellor
absolutely
astounded
looked
at
each
other
speechless
this
passed
their
comprehension
if
the
old
culverin
of
the
château
which
had
not
been
used
since
had
been
let
off
in
the
parlour
the
dwellers
in
the
van
tricasse
mansion
would
not
have
been
more
dumbfoundered
meanwhile
the
blows
and
cries
were
redoubled
lotchè
recovering
her
coolness
had
plucked
up
courage
to
speak
who
is
there
it
is
i
i
i
who
are
you
the
commissary
passauf
the
commissary
passauf
the
very
man
whose
office
it
had
been
contemplated
to
suppress
for
ten
years
what
had
happened
then
could
the
burgundians
have
invaded
quiquendone
as
they
did
in
the
fourteenth
century
no
event
of
less
importance
could
have
so
moved
commissary
passauf
who
in
no
degree
yielded
the
palm
to
the
burgomaster
himself
for
calmness
and
phlegm
on
a
sign
from
van
tricasse
for
the
worthy
man
could
not
have
articulated
a
syllable
the
bar
was
pushed
back
and
the
door
opened
commissary
passauf
flung
himself
into
the
antechamber
one
would
have
thought
there
was
a
hurricane
what
the
matter
monsieur
the
commissary
asked
lotchè
a
brave
woman
who
did
not
lose
her
head
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
what
the
matter
replied
passauf
whose
big
round
eyes
expressed
a
genuine
agitation
the
matter
is
that
i
have
just
come
from
doctor
ox
who
has
been
holding
a
reception
and
that
there
illustration
i
have
just
come
from
doctor
ox
there
there
i
have
witnessed
such
an
altercation
as
monsieur
the
burgomaster
they
have
been
talking
politics
politics
repeated
van
tricasse
running
his
fingers
through
his
wig
politics
resumed
commissary
passauf
which
has
not
been
done
for
perhaps
a
hundred
years
at
quiquendone
then
the
discussion
got
warm
and
the
advocate
andré
schut
and
the
doctor
dominique
custos
became
so
violent
that
it
may
be
they
will
call
each
other
out
call
each
other
out
cried
the
counsellor
a
duel
a
duel
at
quiquendone
and
what
did
advocate
schut
and
doctor
gustos
say
just
this
advocate
said
the
doctor
to
his
adversary
go
too
far
it
seems
to
me
and
you
do
not
take
sufficient
care
to
control
your
words
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
clasped
his
hands
the
counsellor
turned
pale
and
let
his
lantern
fall
the
commissary
shook
his
head
that
a
phrase
so
evidently
irritating
should
be
pronounced
by
two
of
the
principal
men
in
the
country
this
doctor
custos
muttered
van
tricasse
is
decidedly
a
dangerous
man
a
fellow
come
gentlemen
on
this
counsellor
niklausse
and
the
commissary
accompanied
the
burgomaster
into
the
parlour
chapter
iv
in
which
doctor
ox
reveals
himself
as
a
physiologist
of
the
first
rank
and
as
an
audacious
experimentalist
who
then
was
this
personage
known
by
the
singular
name
of
doctor
ox
an
original
character
for
certain
but
at
the
same
time
a
bold
savant
a
physiologist
whose
works
were
known
and
highly
estimated
throughout
learned
europe
a
happy
rival
of
the
davys
the
daltons
the
bostocks
the
menzies
the
godwins
the
vierordts
of
all
those
noble
minds
who
have
placed
physiology
among
the
highest
of
modern
sciences
doctor
ox
was
a
man
of
medium
size
and
height
aged
but
we
can
not
state
his
age
any
more
than
his
nationality
besides
it
matters
little
let
it
suffice
that
he
was
a
strange
personage
impetuous
and
a
regular
oddity
out
of
one
of
hoffmann
volumes
and
one
who
contrasted
amusingly
enough
with
the
good
people
of
quiquendone
he
had
an
imperturbable
confidence
both
in
himself
and
in
his
doctrines
always
smiling
walking
with
head
erect
and
shoulders
thrown
back
in
a
free
and
unconstrained
manner
with
a
steady
gaze
large
open
nostrils
a
vast
mouth
which
inhaled
the
air
in
liberal
draughts
his
appearance
was
far
from
unpleasing
he
was
full
of
animation
well
proportioned
in
all
parts
of
his
bodily
mechanism
with
quicksilver
in
his
veins
and
a
most
elastic
step
he
could
never
stop
still
in
one
place
and
relieved
himself
with
impetuous
words
and
a
superabundance
of
gesticulations
was
doctor
ox
rich
then
that
he
should
undertake
to
light
a
whole
town
at
his
expense
probably
as
he
permitted
himself
to
indulge
in
such
extravagance
and
this
is
the
only
answer
we
can
give
to
this
indiscreet
question
doctor
ox
had
arrived
at
quiquendone
five
months
before
accompanied
by
his
assistant
who
answered
to
the
name
of
gédéon
ygène
a
tall
thin
man
haughty
but
not
less
vivacious
than
his
master
and
next
why
had
doctor
ox
made
the
proposition
to
light
the
town
at
his
own
expense
why
had
he
of
all
the
flemings
selected
the
peaceable
quiquendonians
to
endow
their
town
with
the
benefits
of
an
system
of
lighting
did
he
not
under
this
pretext
design
to
make
some
great
physiological
experiment
by
operating
anima
vili
in
short
what
was
this
original
personage
about
to
attempt
we
know
not
as
doctor
ox
had
no
confidant
except
his
assistant
ygène
who
moreover
obeyed
him
blindly
in
appearance
at
least
doctor
ox
had
agreed
to
light
the
town
which
had
much
need
of
it
especially
at
night
as
commissary
passauf
wittily
said
works
for
producing
a
lighting
gas
had
accordingly
been
established
the
gasometers
were
ready
for
use
and
the
main
pipes
running
beneath
the
street
pavements
would
soon
appear
in
the
form
of
burners
in
the
public
edifices
and
the
private
houses
of
certain
friends
of
progress
van
tricasse
and
niklausse
in
their
official
capacity
and
some
other
worthies
thought
they
ought
to
allow
this
modern
light
to
be
introduced
into
their
dwellings
if
the
reader
has
not
forgotten
it
was
said
during
the
long
conversation
of
the
counsellor
and
the
burgomaster
that
the
lighting
of
the
town
was
to
be
achieved
not
by
the
combustion
of
common
carburetted
hydrogen
produced
by
distilling
coal
but
by
the
use
of
a
more
modern
and
more
brilliant
gas
oxyhydric
gas
produced
by
mixing
hydrogen
and
oxygen
the
doctor
who
was
an
able
chemist
as
well
as
an
ingenious
physiologist
knew
how
to
obtain
this
gas
in
great
quantity
and
of
good
quality
not
by
using
manganate
of
soda
according
to
the
method
of
tessié
du
motay
but
by
the
direct
decomposition
of
slightly
acidulated
water
by
means
of
a
battery
made
of
new
elements
invented
by
himself
thus
there
were
no
costly
materials
no
platinum
no
retorts
no
combustibles
no
delicate
machinery
to
produce
the
two
gases
separately
an
electric
current
was
sent
through
large
basins
full
of
water
and
the
liquid
was
decomposed
into
its
two
constituent
parts
oxygen
and
hydrogen
the
oxygen
passed
off
at
one
end
the
hydrogen
of
double
the
volume
of
its
late
associate
at
the
other
as
a
necessary
precaution
they
were
collected
in
separate
reservoirs
for
their
mixture
would
have
produced
a
frightful
explosion
if
it
had
become
ignited
thence
the
pipes
were
to
convey
them
separately
to
the
various
burners
which
would
be
so
placed
as
to
prevent
all
chance
of
explosion
thus
a
remarkably
brilliant
flame
would
be
obtained
whose
light
would
rival
the
electric
light
which
as
everybody
knows
is
according
to
experiments
equal
to
that
of
eleven
hundred
and
wax
candles
not
one
more
nor
one
less
it
was
certain
that
the
town
of
quiquendone
would
by
this
liberal
contrivance
gain
a
splendid
lighting
but
doctor
ox
and
his
assistant
took
little
account
of
this
as
will
be
seen
in
the
sequel
the
day
after
that
on
which
commissary
passauf
had
made
his
noisy
entrance
into
the
burgomaster
parlour
gédéon
ygène
and
doctor
ox
were
talking
in
the
laboratory
which
both
occupied
in
common
on
the
of
the
principal
building
of
the
well
ygène
well
cried
the
doctor
rubbing
his
hands
you
saw
at
my
reception
yesterday
the
of
these
worthy
quiquendonians
for
animation
they
are
midway
between
sponges
and
coral
you
saw
them
disputing
and
irritating
each
other
by
voice
and
gesture
they
are
already
metamorphosed
morally
and
physically
and
this
is
only
the
beginning
wait
till
we
treat
them
to
a
big
dose
indeed
master
replied
ygène
scratching
his
sharp
nose
with
the
end
of
his
forefinger
the
experiment
begins
well
and
if
i
had
not
prudently
closed
the
i
know
not
what
would
have
happened
you
heard
schut
the
advocate
and
custos
the
doctor
resumed
doctor
ox
the
phrase
was
by
no
means
in
itself
but
in
the
mouth
of
a
quiquendonian
it
is
worth
all
the
insults
which
the
homeric
heroes
hurled
at
each
other
before
drawing
their
swords
ah
these
flemings
you
see
what
we
shall
do
some
day
we
shall
make
them
ungrateful
replied
ygène
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
esteems
the
human
race
at
its
just
worth
bah
said
the
doctor
what
matters
it
whether
they
think
well
or
ill
of
us
so
long
as
our
experiment
succeeds
besides
returned
the
assistant
smiling
with
a
malicious
expression
is
it
not
to
be
feared
that
in
producing
such
an
excitement
in
their
respiratory
organs
we
shall
somewhat
injure
the
lungs
of
these
good
people
of
quiquendone
so
much
the
worse
for
them
it
is
in
the
interests
of
science
what
would
you
say
if
the
dogs
or
frogs
refused
to
lend
themselves
to
the
experiments
of
vivisection
illustration
it
is
in
the
interests
of
science
it
is
probable
that
if
the
frogs
and
dogs
were
consulted
they
would
offer
some
objection
but
doctor
ox
imagined
that
he
had
stated
an
unanswerable
argument
for
he
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
satisfaction
after
all
master
you
are
right
replied
ygène
as
if
quite
convinced
we
could
not
have
hit
upon
better
subjects
than
these
people
of
quiquendone
for
our
experiment
we
could
not
said
the
doctor
slowly
articulating
each
word
have
you
felt
the
pulse
of
any
of
them
some
hundreds
and
what
is
the
average
pulsation
you
found
not
fifty
per
minute
see
this
is
a
town
where
there
has
not
been
the
shadow
of
a
discussion
for
a
century
where
the
carmen
do
swear
where
the
coachmen
do
insult
each
other
where
horses
do
run
away
where
the
dogs
do
bite
where
the
cats
do
scratch
a
town
where
the
has
nothing
to
do
from
one
year
end
to
another
a
town
where
people
do
not
grow
enthusiastic
about
anything
either
about
art
or
business
a
town
where
the
gendarmes
are
a
sort
of
myth
and
in
which
an
indictment
has
not
been
drawn
up
for
a
hundred
years
a
town
in
short
where
for
three
centuries
nobody
has
struck
a
blow
with
his
fist
or
so
much
as
exchanged
a
slap
in
the
face
you
see
ygène
that
this
can
not
last
and
that
we
must
change
it
all
perfectly
perfectly
cried
the
enthusiastic
assistant
and
have
you
analyzed
the
air
of
this
town
master
i
have
not
failed
to
do
so
parts
of
azote
and
of
oxygen
carbonic
acid
and
steam
in
a
variable
quantity
these
are
the
ordinary
proportions
good
doctor
good
replied
ygène
the
experiment
will
be
made
on
a
large
scale
and
will
be
decisive
and
if
it
is
decisive
added
doctor
ox
triumphantly
we
shall
reform
the
world
chapter
in
which
the
burgomaster
and
the
counsellor
pay
a
visit
to
doctor
ox
and
what
follows
the
counsellor
niklausse
and
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
at
last
knew
what
it
was
to
have
an
agitated
night
the
grave
event
which
had
taken
place
at
doctor
ox
house
actually
kept
them
awake
what
consequences
was
this
affair
destined
to
bring
about
they
could
not
imagine
would
it
be
necessary
for
them
to
come
to
a
decision
would
the
municipal
authority
whom
they
represented
be
compelled
to
interfere
would
they
be
obliged
to
order
arrests
to
be
made
that
so
great
a
scandal
should
not
be
repeated
all
these
doubts
could
not
but
trouble
these
soft
natures
and
on
that
evening
before
separating
the
two
notables
had
decided
to
see
each
other
the
next
day
on
the
next
morning
then
before
dinner
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
proceeded
in
person
to
the
counsellor
niklausse
house
he
found
his
friend
more
calm
he
himself
had
recovered
his
equanimity
nothing
new
asked
van
tricasse
nothing
new
since
yesterday
replied
niklausse
and
the
doctor
dominique
custos
i
have
not
heard
anything
either
of
him
or
of
the
advocate
andré
schut
after
an
hour
conversation
which
consisted
of
three
remarks
which
it
is
needless
to
repeat
the
counsellor
and
the
burgomaster
had
resolved
to
pay
a
visit
to
doctor
ox
so
as
to
draw
from
him
without
seeming
to
do
so
some
details
of
the
affair
contrary
to
all
their
habits
after
coming
to
this
decision
the
two
notables
set
about
putting
it
into
execution
forthwith
they
left
the
house
and
directed
their
steps
towards
doctor
laboratory
which
was
situated
outside
the
town
near
the
oudenarde
gate
the
gate
whose
tower
threatened
to
fall
in
ruins
they
did
not
take
each
other
arms
but
walked
side
by
side
with
a
slow
and
solemn
step
which
took
them
forward
but
thirteen
inches
per
second
this
was
indeed
the
ordinary
gait
of
the
quiquendonians
who
had
never
within
the
memory
of
man
seen
any
one
run
across
the
streets
of
their
town
from
time
to
time
the
two
notables
would
stop
at
some
calm
and
tranquil
crossway
or
at
the
end
of
a
quiet
street
to
salute
the
good
morning
monsieur
the
burgomaster
said
one
good
morning
my
friend
responded
van
tricasse
anything
new
monsieur
the
counsellor
asked
another
nothing
new
answered
niklausse
but
by
certain
agitated
motions
and
questioning
looks
it
was
evident
that
the
altercation
of
the
evening
before
was
known
throughout
the
town
observing
the
direction
taken
by
van
tricasse
the
most
obtuse
quiquendonians
guessed
that
the
burgomaster
was
on
his
way
to
take
some
important
step
the
custos
and
schut
affair
was
talked
of
everywhere
but
the
people
had
not
yet
come
to
the
point
of
taking
the
part
of
one
or
the
other
the
advocate
schut
having
never
had
occasion
to
plead
in
a
town
where
attorneys
and
bailiffs
only
existed
in
tradition
had
consequently
never
lost
a
suit
as
for
the
doctor
custos
he
was
an
honourable
practitioner
who
after
the
example
of
his
cured
all
the
illnesses
of
his
patients
except
those
of
which
they
died
a
habit
unhappily
acquired
by
all
the
members
of
all
the
faculties
in
whatever
country
they
may
practise
on
reaching
the
oudenarde
gate
the
counsellor
and
the
burgomaster
prudently
made
a
short
detour
so
as
not
to
pass
within
reach
of
the
tower
in
case
it
should
fall
then
they
turned
and
looked
at
it
attentively
i
think
that
it
will
fall
said
van
tricasse
i
think
so
too
replied
niklausse
unless
it
is
propped
up
added
van
tricasse
but
must
it
be
propped
up
that
is
the
question
that
is
in
fact
the
question
some
moments
after
they
reached
the
door
of
the
gasworks
can
we
see
doctor
ox
they
asked
doctor
ox
could
always
be
seen
by
the
first
authorities
of
the
town
and
they
were
at
once
introduced
into
the
celebrated
physiologist
study
perhaps
the
two
notables
waited
for
the
doctor
at
least
an
hour
at
least
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
so
as
the
burgomaster
a
thing
that
had
never
before
happened
in
his
life
betrayed
a
certain
amount
of
impatience
from
which
his
companion
was
not
exempt
doctor
ox
came
in
at
last
and
began
to
excuse
himself
for
having
kept
them
waiting
but
he
had
to
approve
a
plan
for
the
gasometer
rectify
some
of
the
machinery
but
everything
was
going
on
well
the
pipes
intended
for
the
oxygen
were
already
laid
in
a
few
months
the
town
would
be
splendidly
lighted
the
two
notables
might
even
now
see
the
orifices
of
the
pipes
which
were
laid
on
in
the
laboratory
then
the
doctor
begged
to
know
to
what
he
was
indebted
for
the
honour
of
this
visit
only
to
see
you
doctor
to
see
you
replied
van
tricasse
it
is
long
since
we
have
had
the
pleasure
we
go
abroad
but
little
in
our
good
town
of
quiquendone
we
count
our
steps
and
measure
our
walks
we
are
happy
when
nothing
disturbs
the
uniformity
of
our
habits
niklausse
looked
at
his
friend
his
friend
had
never
said
so
much
at
once
at
least
without
taking
time
and
giving
long
intervals
between
his
sentences
it
seemed
to
him
that
van
tricasse
expressed
himself
with
a
certain
volubility
which
was
by
no
means
common
with
him
niklausse
himself
experienced
a
kind
of
irresistible
desire
to
talk
as
for
doctor
ox
he
looked
at
the
burgomaster
with
sly
attention
van
tricasse
who
never
argued
until
he
had
snugly
ensconced
himself
in
a
spacious
armchair
had
risen
to
his
feet
i
know
not
what
nervous
excitement
quite
foreign
to
his
temperament
had
taken
possession
of
him
he
did
not
gesticulate
as
yet
but
this
could
not
be
far
off
as
for
the
counsellor
he
rubbed
his
legs
and
breathed
with
slow
and
long
gasps
his
look
became
animated
little
by
little
and
he
had
decided
to
support
at
all
hazards
if
need
be
his
trusty
friend
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
got
up
and
took
several
steps
then
he
came
back
and
stood
facing
the
doctor
and
in
how
many
months
he
asked
in
a
somewhat
emphatic
tome
do
you
say
that
your
work
will
be
finished
in
three
or
four
months
monsieur
the
burgomaster
replied
doctor
ox
three
or
four
months
it
a
very
long
time
said
van
tricasse
altogether
too
long
added
niklausse
who
not
being
able
to
keep
his
seat
rose
also
this
lapse
of
time
is
necessary
to
complete
our
work
returned
doctor
ox
the
workmen
whom
we
have
had
to
choose
in
quiquendone
are
not
very
expeditious
illustration
the
workmen
whom
we
have
had
to
choose
in
quiquendone
are
not
very
expeditious
how
not
expeditious
cried
the
burgomaster
who
seemed
to
take
the
remark
as
personally
offensive
no
monsieur
van
tricasse
replied
doctor
ox
obstinately
a
french
workman
would
do
in
a
day
what
it
takes
ten
of
your
workmen
to
do
you
know
they
are
regular
flemings
flemings
cried
the
counsellor
whose
fingers
closed
together
in
what
sense
sir
do
you
use
that
word
why
in
the
amiable
sense
in
which
everybody
uses
it
replied
doctor
ox
smiling
ah
but
doctor
said
the
burgomaster
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
i
do
like
these
insinuations
the
workmen
of
quiquendone
are
as
efficient
as
those
of
any
other
town
in
the
world
you
must
know
and
we
shall
go
neither
to
paris
nor
london
for
our
models
as
for
your
project
i
beg
you
to
hasten
its
execution
our
streets
have
been
unpaved
for
the
putting
down
of
your
and
it
is
a
hindrance
to
traffic
our
trade
will
begin
to
suffer
and
i
being
the
responsible
authority
do
not
propose
to
incur
reproaches
which
will
be
but
too
just
worthy
burgomaster
he
spoke
of
trade
of
traffic
and
the
wonder
was
that
those
words
to
which
he
was
quite
unaccustomed
did
not
scorch
his
lips
what
could
be
passing
in
his
mind
besides
added
niklausse
the
town
can
not
be
deprived
of
light
much
longer
but
urged
doctor
ox
a
town
which
has
been
for
eight
or
nine
hundred
years
all
the
more
necessary
is
it
replied
the
burgomaster
emphasizing
his
words
times
alter
manners
alter
the
world
advances
and
we
do
not
wish
to
remain
behind
we
desire
our
streets
to
be
lighted
within
a
month
or
you
must
pay
a
large
indemnity
for
each
day
of
delay
and
what
would
happen
if
amid
the
darkness
some
affray
should
take
place
no
doubt
cried
niklausse
it
requires
but
a
spark
to
inflame
a
fleming
fleming
flame
apropos
of
this
said
the
burgomaster
interrupting
his
friend
commissary
passauf
our
chief
of
police
reports
to
us
that
a
discussion
took
place
in
your
last
evening
doctor
ox
was
he
wrong
in
declaring
that
it
was
a
political
discussion
by
no
means
monsieur
the
burgomaster
replied
doctor
ox
who
with
difficulty
repressed
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
so
an
altercation
did
take
place
between
dominique
gustos
and
andré
schut
yes
counsellor
but
the
words
which
passed
were
not
of
grave
import
not
of
grave
import
cried
the
burgomaster
not
of
grave
import
when
one
man
tells
another
that
he
does
not
measure
the
effect
of
his
words
but
of
what
stuff
are
you
made
monsieur
do
you
not
know
that
in
quiquendone
nothing
more
is
needed
to
bring
about
extremely
disastrous
results
but
monsieur
if
you
or
any
one
else
presume
to
speak
thus
to
me
or
to
me
added
niklausse
as
they
pronounced
these
words
with
a
menacing
air
the
two
notables
with
folded
arms
and
bristling
air
confronted
doctor
ox
ready
to
do
him
some
violence
if
by
a
gesture
or
even
the
expression
of
his
eye
he
manifested
any
intention
of
contradicting
them
but
the
doctor
did
not
budge
at
all
events
monsieur
resumed
the
burgomaster
i
propose
to
hold
you
responsible
for
what
passes
in
your
house
i
am
bound
to
insure
the
tranquillity
of
this
town
and
i
do
not
wish
it
to
be
disturbed
the
events
of
last
evening
must
not
be
repeated
or
i
shall
do
my
duty
sir
do
you
hear
then
reply
sir
the
burgomaster
as
he
spoke
under
the
influence
of
extraordinary
excitement
elevated
his
voice
to
the
pitch
of
anger
he
was
furious
the
worthy
van
tricasse
and
might
certainly
be
heard
outside
at
last
beside
himself
and
seeing
that
doctor
ox
did
not
reply
to
his
challenge
come
niklausse
said
he
and
slamming
the
door
with
a
violence
which
shook
the
house
the
burgomaster
drew
his
friend
after
him
little
by
little
when
they
had
taken
twenty
steps
on
their
road
the
worthy
notables
grew
more
calm
their
pace
slackened
their
gait
became
less
feverish
the
flush
on
their
faces
faded
away
from
being
crimson
they
became
rosy
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
quitting
the
gasworks
van
tricasse
said
softly
to
niklausse
an
amiable
man
doctor
ox
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
see
him
chapter
vi
in
which
frantz
niklausse
and
suzel
van
tricasse
form
certain
projects
for
the
future
our
readers
know
that
the
burgomaster
had
a
daughter
suzel
but
shrewd
as
they
may
be
they
can
not
have
divined
that
the
counsellor
niklausse
had
a
son
frantz
and
had
they
divined
this
nothing
could
have
led
them
to
imagine
that
frantz
was
the
betrothed
lover
of
suzel
we
will
add
that
these
young
people
were
made
for
each
other
and
that
they
loved
each
other
as
folks
did
love
at
quiquendone
it
must
not
be
thought
that
young
hearts
did
not
beat
in
this
exceptional
place
only
they
beat
with
a
certain
deliberation
there
were
marriages
there
as
in
every
other
town
in
the
world
but
they
took
time
about
it
betrothed
couples
before
engaging
in
these
terrible
bonds
wished
to
study
each
other
and
these
studies
lasted
at
least
ten
years
as
at
college
it
was
rare
that
any
one
was
accepted
before
this
lapse
of
time
yes
ten
years
the
courtships
last
ten
years
and
is
it
after
all
too
long
when
the
being
bound
for
life
is
in
consideration
one
studies
ten
years
to
become
an
engineer
or
physician
an
advocate
or
attorney
and
should
less
time
be
spent
in
acquiring
the
knowledge
to
make
a
good
husband
is
it
not
reasonable
and
whether
due
to
temperament
or
reason
with
them
the
quiquendonians
seem
to
us
to
be
in
the
right
in
thus
prolonging
their
courtship
when
marriages
in
other
more
lively
and
excitable
cities
are
seen
taking
place
within
a
few
months
we
must
shrug
our
shoulders
and
hasten
to
send
our
boys
to
the
schools
and
our
daughters
to
the
of
quiquendone
for
half
a
century
but
a
single
marriage
was
known
to
have
taken
place
after
the
lapse
of
two
years
only
of
courtship
and
that
turned
out
badly
frantz
niklausse
then
loved
suzel
van
tricasse
but
quietly
as
a
man
would
love
when
he
has
ten
years
before
him
in
which
to
obtain
the
beloved
object
once
every
week
at
an
hour
agreed
upon
frantz
went
to
fetch
suzel
and
took
a
walk
with
her
along
the
banks
of
the
vaar
he
took
good
care
to
carry
his
and
suzel
never
forgot
her
canvas
on
which
her
pretty
hands
embroidered
the
most
unlikely
flowers
frantz
was
a
young
man
of
whose
cheeks
betrayed
a
soft
peachy
down
and
whose
voice
had
scarcely
a
compass
of
one
octave
as
for
suzel
she
was
blonde
and
rosy
she
was
seventeen
and
did
not
dislike
fishing
a
singular
occupation
this
however
which
forces
you
to
struggle
craftily
with
a
barbel
but
frantz
loved
it
the
pastime
was
congenial
to
his
temperament
as
patient
as
possible
content
to
follow
with
his
rather
dreamy
eye
the
cork
which
bobbed
on
the
top
of
the
water
he
knew
how
to
wait
and
when
after
sitting
for
six
hours
a
modest
barbel
taking
pity
on
him
consented
at
last
to
be
caught
he
was
happy
but
he
knew
how
to
control
his
emotion
on
this
day
the
two
lovers
one
might
say
the
two
betrothed
were
seated
upon
the
verdant
bank
the
limpid
vaar
murmured
a
few
feet
below
them
suzel
quietly
drew
her
needle
across
the
canvas
frantz
automatically
carried
his
line
from
left
to
right
then
permitted
it
to
descend
the
current
from
right
to
left
the
fish
made
capricious
rings
in
the
water
which
crossed
each
other
around
the
cork
while
the
hook
hung
useless
near
the
bottom
from
time
to
time
frantz
would
say
without
raising
his
eyes
i
think
i
have
a
bite
suzel
do
you
think
so
frantz
replied
suzel
who
abandoning
her
work
for
an
instant
followed
her
lover
line
with
earnest
eye
resumed
frantz
i
thought
i
felt
a
little
twitch
i
was
mistaken
you
have
a
bite
frantz
replied
suzel
in
her
pure
soft
voice
but
do
not
forget
to
strike
at
the
right
moment
you
are
always
a
few
seconds
too
late
and
the
barbel
takes
advantage
to
escape
would
you
like
to
take
my
line
suzel
willingly
frantz
then
give
me
your
canvas
we
shall
see
whether
i
am
more
adroit
with
the
needle
than
with
the
hook
and
the
young
girl
took
the
line
with
trembling
hand
while
her
swain
plied
the
needle
across
the
stitches
of
the
embroidery
for
hours
together
they
thus
exchanged
soft
words
and
their
hearts
palpitated
when
the
cork
bobbed
on
the
water
ah
could
they
ever
forget
those
charming
hours
during
which
seated
side
by
side
they
listened
to
the
murmurs
of
the
river
illustration
the
young
girl
took
the
line
the
sun
was
fast
approaching
the
western
horizon
and
despite
the
combined
skill
of
suzel
and
frantz
there
had
not
been
a
bite
the
barbels
had
not
shown
themselves
complacent
and
seemed
to
scoff
at
the
two
young
people
who
were
too
just
to
bear
them
malice
we
shall
be
more
lucky
another
time
frantz
said
suzel
as
the
young
angler
put
up
his
still
virgin
hook
let
us
hope
so
replied
frantz
then
walking
side
by
side
they
turned
their
steps
towards
the
house
without
exchanging
a
word
as
mute
as
their
shadows
which
stretched
out
before
them
suzel
became
very
very
tall
under
the
oblique
rays
of
the
setting
sun
frantz
appeared
very
very
thin
like
the
long
rod
which
he
held
in
his
hand
they
reached
the
burgomaster
house
green
tufts
of
grass
bordered
the
shining
pavement
and
no
one
would
have
thought
of
tearing
them
away
for
they
deadened
the
noise
made
by
the
as
they
were
about
to
open
the
door
frantz
thought
it
his
duty
to
say
to
suzel
you
know
suzel
the
great
day
is
approaching
it
is
indeed
frantz
replied
the
young
girl
with
downcast
eyes
yes
said
frantz
in
five
or
six
years
frantz
said
suzel
illustration
frantz
said
suzel
suzel
replied
frantz
and
after
the
door
had
been
closed
the
young
man
resumed
the
way
to
his
father
house
with
a
calm
and
equal
pace
chapter
vii
in
which
the
andantes
become
allegros
and
the
allegros
vivaces
the
agitation
caused
by
the
schut
and
custos
affair
had
subsided
the
affair
led
to
no
serious
consequences
it
appeared
likely
that
quiquendone
would
return
to
its
habitual
apathy
which
that
unexpected
event
had
for
a
moment
disturbed
meanwhile
the
laying
of
the
pipes
destined
to
conduct
the
oxyhydric
gas
into
the
principal
edifices
of
the
town
was
proceeding
rapidly
the
main
pipes
and
branches
gradually
crept
beneath
the
pavements
but
the
burners
were
still
wanting
for
as
it
required
delicate
skill
to
make
them
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
fabricated
abroad
doctor
ox
was
here
there
and
everywhere
neither
he
nor
ygène
his
assistant
lost
a
moment
but
they
urged
on
the
workmen
completed
the
delicate
mechanism
of
the
gasometer
fed
day
and
night
the
immense
piles
which
decomposed
the
water
under
the
influence
of
a
powerful
electric
current
yes
the
doctor
was
already
making
his
gas
though
the
was
not
yet
done
a
fact
which
between
ourselves
might
have
seemed
a
little
singular
but
before
long
at
least
there
was
reason
to
hope
so
before
long
doctor
ox
would
inaugurate
the
splendours
of
his
invention
in
the
theatre
of
the
town
for
quiquendone
possessed
a
theatre
a
really
fine
edifice
in
truth
the
interior
and
exterior
arrangement
of
which
combined
every
style
of
architecture
it
was
at
once
byzantine
roman
gothic
renaissance
with
semicircular
doors
pointed
windows
flamboyant
fantastic
in
a
word
a
specimen
of
all
sorts
half
a
parthenon
half
a
parisian
grand
café
nor
was
this
surprising
the
theatre
having
been
commenced
under
the
burgomaster
ludwig
van
tricasse
in
and
only
finished
in
under
the
burgomaster
natalis
van
tricasse
it
had
required
seven
hundred
years
to
build
it
and
it
had
been
successively
adapted
to
the
architectural
style
in
vogue
in
each
period
but
for
all
that
it
was
an
imposing
structure
the
roman
pillars
and
byzantine
arches
of
which
would
appear
to
advantage
lit
up
by
the
oxyhydric
gas
pretty
well
everything
was
acted
at
the
theatre
of
quiquendone
but
the
opera
and
the
opera
comique
were
especially
patronized
it
must
however
be
added
that
the
composers
would
never
have
recognized
their
own
works
so
entirely
changed
were
the
movements
of
the
music
in
short
as
nothing
was
done
in
a
hurry
at
quiquendone
the
dramatic
pieces
had
to
be
performed
in
harmony
with
the
peculiar
temperament
of
the
quiquendonians
though
the
doors
of
the
theatre
were
regularly
thrown
open
at
four
and
closed
again
at
ten
it
had
never
been
known
that
more
than
two
acts
were
played
during
the
six
intervening
hours
robert
le
diable
les
huguenots
or
guillaume
tell
usually
took
up
three
evenings
so
slow
was
the
execution
of
these
masterpieces
the
at
the
theatre
of
quiquendone
lagged
like
real
the
were
out
indeed
the
demisemiquavers
were
scarcely
equal
to
the
ordinary
semibreves
of
other
countries
the
most
rapid
runs
performed
according
to
quiquendonian
taste
had
the
solemn
march
of
a
chant
the
gayest
shakes
were
languishing
and
measured
that
they
might
not
shock
the
ears
of
the
to
give
an
example
the
rapid
air
sung
by
figaro
on
his
entrance
in
the
first
act
of
le
barbiér
de
séville
lasted
minutes
when
the
actor
was
particularly
enthusiastic
artists
from
abroad
as
might
be
supposed
were
forced
to
conform
themselves
to
quiquendonian
fashions
but
as
they
were
well
paid
they
did
not
complain
and
willingly
obeyed
the
leader
baton
which
never
beat
more
than
eight
measures
to
the
minute
in
the
but
what
applause
greeted
these
artists
who
enchanted
without
ever
wearying
the
audiences
of
quiquendone
all
hands
clapped
one
after
another
at
tolerably
long
intervals
which
the
papers
characterized
as
frantic
applause
and
sometimes
nothing
but
the
lavish
prodigality
with
which
mortar
and
stone
had
been
used
in
the
twelfth
century
saved
the
roof
of
the
hall
from
falling
in
besides
the
theatre
had
only
one
performance
a
week
that
these
enthusiastic
flemish
folk
might
not
be
too
much
excited
and
this
enabled
the
actors
to
study
their
parts
more
thoroughly
and
the
spectators
to
digest
more
at
leisure
the
beauties
of
the
masterpieces
brought
out
such
had
long
been
the
drama
at
quiquendone
foreign
artists
were
in
the
habit
of
making
engagements
with
the
director
of
the
town
when
they
wanted
to
rest
after
their
exertions
in
other
scenes
and
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
ever
change
these
inveterate
customs
when
a
fortnight
after
the
affair
an
incident
occurred
to
throw
the
population
into
fresh
agitation
it
was
on
a
saturday
an
opera
day
it
was
not
yet
intended
as
may
well
be
supposed
to
inaugurate
the
new
illumination
no
the
pipes
had
reached
the
hall
but
for
reasons
indicated
above
the
burners
had
not
yet
been
placed
and
the
still
shed
their
soft
light
upon
the
numerous
spectators
who
filled
the
theatre
the
doors
had
been
opened
to
the
public
at
one
and
by
three
the
hall
was
half
full
a
queue
had
at
one
time
been
formed
which
extended
as
far
as
the
end
of
the
place
saint
ernuph
in
front
of
the
shop
of
josse
lietrinck
the
apothecary
this
eagerness
was
significant
of
an
unusually
attractive
performance
are
you
going
to
the
theatre
this
evening
inquired
the
counsellor
the
same
morning
of
the
burgomaster
i
shall
not
fail
to
do
so
returned
van
tricasse
and
i
shall
take
madame
van
tricasse
as
well
as
our
daughter
suzel
and
our
dear
tatanémance
who
all
dote
on
good
music
mademoiselle
suzel
is
going
then
certainly
niklausse
then
my
son
frantz
will
be
one
of
the
first
to
arrive
said
niklausse
a
spirited
boy
niklausse
replied
the
burgomaster
sententiously
but
he
will
require
watching
he
loves
van
tricasse
he
loves
your
charming
suzel
well
niklausse
he
shall
marry
her
now
that
we
have
agreed
on
this
marriage
what
more
can
he
desire
he
desires
nothing
van
tricasse
the
dear
boy
but
in
short
we
say
no
more
about
it
he
will
not
be
the
last
to
get
his
ticket
at
the
ah
vivacious
and
ardent
youth
replied
the
burgomaster
recalling
his
own
past
we
have
also
been
thus
my
worthy
counsellor
we
have
loved
we
too
we
have
danced
attendance
in
our
day
till
then
till
do
you
know
this
fiovaranti
is
a
great
artist
and
what
a
welcome
he
has
received
among
us
it
will
be
long
before
he
will
forget
the
applause
of
quiquendone
the
tenor
fiovaranti
was
indeed
going
to
sing
fiovaranti
who
by
his
talents
as
a
virtuoso
his
perfect
method
his
melodious
voice
provoked
a
real
enthusiasm
among
the
lovers
of
music
in
the
town
for
three
weeks
fiovaranti
had
been
achieving
a
brilliant
success
in
les
huguenots
the
first
act
interpreted
according
to
the
taste
of
the
quiquendonians
had
occupied
an
entire
evening
of
the
first
week
of
the
another
evening
in
the
second
week
prolonged
by
infinite
had
elicited
for
the
celebrated
singer
a
real
ovation
his
success
had
been
still
more
marked
in
the
third
act
of
meyerbeer
masterpiece
but
now
fiovaranti
was
to
appear
in
the
fourth
act
which
was
to
be
performed
on
this
evening
before
an
impatient
public
ah
the
duet
between
raoul
and
valentine
that
pathetic
for
two
voices
that
strain
so
full
of
and
all
this
sung
slowly
compendiously
interminably
ah
how
delightful
illustration
fiovaranti
had
been
achieving
a
brilliant
success
in
les
huguenots
at
four
the
hall
was
full
the
boxes
the
orchestra
the
pit
were
overflowing
in
the
front
stalls
sat
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
mademoiselle
van
tricasse
madame
van
tricasse
and
the
amiable
tatanémance
in
a
green
bonnet
not
far
off
were
the
counsellor
niklausse
and
his
family
not
forgetting
the
amorous
frantz
the
families
of
custos
the
doctor
of
schut
the
advocate
of
honoré
syntax
the
chief
judge
of
norbet
sontman
the
insurance
director
of
the
banker
collaert
gone
mad
on
german
music
and
himself
somewhat
of
an
amateur
and
the
teacher
rupp
and
the
master
of
the
academy
jerome
resh
and
the
civil
commissary
and
so
many
other
notabilities
of
the
town
that
they
could
not
be
enumerated
here
without
wearying
the
reader
patience
were
visible
in
different
parts
of
the
hall
it
was
customary
for
the
quiquendonians
while
awaiting
the
rise
of
the
curtain
to
sit
silent
some
reading
the
paper
others
whispering
low
to
each
other
some
making
their
way
to
their
seats
slowly
and
noiselessly
others
casting
timid
looks
towards
the
bewitching
beauties
in
the
galleries
but
on
this
evening
a
might
have
observed
that
even
before
the
curtain
rose
there
was
unusual
animation
among
the
audience
people
were
restless
who
were
never
known
to
be
restless
before
the
ladies
fans
fluttered
with
abnormal
rapidity
all
appeared
to
be
inhaling
air
of
exceptional
stimulating
power
every
one
breathed
more
freely
the
eyes
of
some
became
unwontedly
bright
and
seemed
to
give
forth
a
light
equal
to
that
of
the
candles
which
themselves
certainly
threw
a
more
brilliant
light
over
the
hall
it
was
evident
that
people
saw
more
clearly
though
the
number
of
candles
had
not
been
increased
ah
if
doctor
ox
experiment
were
being
tried
but
it
was
not
being
tried
as
yet
the
musicians
of
the
orchestra
at
last
took
their
places
the
first
violin
had
gone
to
the
stand
to
give
a
modest
la
to
his
colleagues
the
stringed
instruments
the
wind
instruments
the
drums
and
cymbals
were
in
accord
the
conductor
only
waited
the
sound
of
the
bell
to
beat
the
first
bar
the
bell
sounds
the
fourth
act
begins
the
of
the
is
played
as
usual
with
a
majestic
deliberation
which
would
have
made
meyerbeer
frantic
and
all
the
majesty
of
which
was
appreciated
by
the
quiquendonian
but
soon
the
leader
perceived
that
he
was
no
longer
master
of
his
musicians
he
found
it
difficult
to
restrain
them
though
usually
so
obedient
and
calm
the
wind
instruments
betrayed
a
tendency
to
hasten
the
movements
and
it
was
necessary
to
hold
them
back
with
a
firm
hand
for
they
would
otherwise
outstrip
the
stringed
instruments
which
from
a
musical
point
of
view
would
have
been
disastrous
the
bassoon
himself
the
son
of
josse
lietrinck
the
apothecary
a
young
man
seemed
to
lose
his
meanwhile
valentine
has
begun
her
recitative
i
am
alone
but
she
hurries
it
the
leader
and
all
his
musicians
perhaps
unconsciously
follow
her
in
her
which
should
be
taken
deliberately
like
a
as
it
is
when
raoul
appears
at
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
stage
between
the
moment
when
valentine
goes
to
him
and
that
when
she
conceals
herself
in
the
chamber
at
the
side
a
quarter
of
an
hour
does
not
elapse
while
formerly
according
to
the
traditions
of
the
quiquendone
theatre
this
recitative
of
bars
was
wont
to
last
just
minutes
saint
bris
nevers
cavannes
and
the
catholic
nobles
have
appeared
somewhat
prematurely
perhaps
upon
the
scene
the
composer
has
marked
on
the
score
the
orchestra
and
the
lords
proceed
indeed
but
not
at
all
and
at
the
chorus
in
the
famous
scene
of
the
benediction
of
the
poniards
they
no
longer
keep
to
the
enjoined
singers
and
musicians
broke
away
impetuously
the
leader
does
not
even
attempt
to
restrain
them
nor
do
the
public
protest
on
the
contrary
the
people
find
themselves
carried
away
and
see
that
they
are
involved
in
the
movement
and
that
the
movement
responds
to
the
impulses
of
their
souls
will
you
with
me
deliver
the
land
from
troubles
increasing
an
impious
band
they
promise
they
swear
nevers
has
scarcely
time
to
protest
and
to
sing
that
among
his
ancestors
were
many
soldiers
but
never
an
assassin
he
is
arrested
the
police
and
the
aldermen
rush
forward
and
rapidly
swear
to
strike
all
at
once
saint
bris
shouts
the
recitative
which
summons
the
catholics
to
vengeance
the
three
monks
with
white
scarfs
hasten
in
by
the
door
at
the
back
of
nevers

without
making
any
account
of
the

directions
which
enjoin
on
them

moments
after

all
have
reached

one
resumes
his
habitual
tranquillity
and
peaceably
enters
his
house
with
a
confused
remembrance
of
what
he
has
just
experienced
the
fourth
act
of
the
huguenots
which
formerly
lasted
six
hours
began
on
this
evening
at
four
and
ended
at
twelve
minutes
before
five
it
had
only
lasted
eighteen
minutes
chapter
viii
in
which
the
ancient
and
solemn
german
waltz
becomes
a
whirlwind
but
if
the
spectators
on
leaving
the
theatre
resumed
their
customary
calm
if
they
quietly
regained
their
homes
preserving
only
a
sort
of
passing
stupefaction
they
had
none
the
less
undergone
a
remarkable
exaltation
and
overcome
and
weary
as
if
they
had
committed
some
excess
of
dissipation
they
fell
heavily
upon
their
beds
the
next
day
each
quiquendonian
had
a
kind
of
recollection
of
what
had
occurred
the
evening
before
one
missed
his
hat
lost
in
the
hubbub
another
a
torn
in
the
brawl
one
her
delicately
fashioned
shoe
another
her
best
mantle
memory
returned
to
these
worthy
people
and
with
it
a
certain
shame
for
their
unjustifiable
agitation
it
seemed
to
them
an
orgy
in
which
they
were
the
unconscious
heroes
and
heroines
they
did
not
speak
of
it
they
did
not
wish
to
think
of
it
but
the
most
astounded
personage
in
the
town
was
van
tricasse
the
burgomaster
the
next
morning
on
waking
he
could
not
find
his
wig
lotchè
looked
everywhere
for
it
but
in
vain
the
wig
had
remained
on
the
field
of
battle
as
for
having
it
publicly
claimed
by
jean
mistrol
the
no
it
would
not
do
it
were
better
to
lose
the
wig
than
to
advertise
himself
thus
as
he
had
the
honour
to
be
the
first
magistrate
of
quiquendone
the
worthy
van
tricasse
was
reflecting
upon
this
extended
beneath
his
sheets
with
bruised
body
heavy
head
furred
tongue
and
burning
breast
he
felt
no
desire
to
get
up
on
the
contrary
and
his
brain
worked
more
during
this
morning
than
it
had
probably
worked
before
for
forty
years
the
worthy
magistrate
recalled
to
his
mind
all
the
incidents
of
the
incomprehensible
performance
he
connected
them
with
the
events
which
had
taken
place
shortly
before
at
doctor
ox
reception
he
tried
to
discover
the
causes
of
the
singular
excitability
which
on
two
occasions
had
betrayed
itself
in
the
best
citizens
of
the
town
what
be
going
on
he
asked
himself
what
giddy
spirit
has
taken
possession
of
my
peaceable
town
of
quiquendone
are
we
about
to
go
mad
and
must
we
make
the
town
one
vast
asylum
for
yesterday
we
were
all
there
notables
counsellors
judges
advocates
physicians
schoolmasters
and
ail
if
my
memory
serves
me
all
of
us
were
assailed
by
this
excess
of
furious
folly
but
what
was
there
in
that
infernal
music
it
is
inexplicable
yet
i
certainly
ate
or
drank
nothing
which
could
put
me
into
such
a
state
no
yesterday
i
had
for
dinner
a
slice
of
overdone
veal
several
spoonfuls
of
spinach
with
sugar
eggs
and
a
little
beer
and
water
that
could
get
into
my
head
no
there
is
something
that
i
can
not
explain
and
as
after
all
i
am
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
the
citizens
i
will
have
an
investigation
but
the
investigation
though
decided
upon
by
the
municipal
council
produced
no
result
if
the
facts
were
clear
the
causes
escaped
the
sagacity
of
the
magistrates
besides
tranquillity
had
been
restored
in
the
public
mind
and
with
tranquillity
forgetfulness
of
the
strange
scenes
of
the
theatre
the
newspapers
avoided
speaking
of
them
and
the
account
of
the
performance
which
appeared
in
the
quiquendone
memorial
made
no
allusion
to
this
intoxication
of
the
entire
audience
meanwhile
though
the
town
resumed
its
habitual
phlegm
and
became
apparently
flemish
as
before
it
was
observable
that
at
bottom
the
character
and
temperament
of
the
people
changed
little
by
little
one
might
have
truly
said
with
dominique
custos
the
doctor
that
their
nerves
were
affected
let
us
explain
this
undoubted
change
only
took
place
under
certain
conditions
when
the
quiquendonians
passed
through
the
streets
of
the
town
walked
in
the
squares
or
along
the
vaar
they
were
always
the
cold
and
methodical
people
of
former
days
so
too
when
they
remained
at
home
some
working
with
their
hands
and
others
with
their
heads
these
doing
nothing
those
thinking
nothing
their
private
life
was
silent
inert
vegetating
as
before
no
quarrels
no
household
squabbles
no
acceleration
in
the
beating
of
the
heart
no
excitement
of
the
brain
the
mean
of
their
pulsations
remained
as
it
was
of
old
from
fifty
to
per
minute
but
strange
and
inexplicable
phenomenon
though
it
was
which
would
have
defied
the
sagacity
of
the
most
ingenious
physiologists
of
the
day
if
the
inhabitants
of
quiquendone
did
not
change
in
their
home
life
they
were
visibly
changed
in
their
civil
life
and
in
their
relations
between
man
and
man
to
which
it
leads
if
they
met
together
in
some
public
edifice
it
did
not
work
well
as
commissary
passauf
expressed
it
on
at
the
in
the
amphitheatre
of
the
academy
at
the
sessions
of
the
council
as
well
as
at
the
reunions
of
the
a
strange
excitement
seized
the
assembled
citizens
their
relations
with
each
other
became
embarrassing
before
they
had
been
together
an
hour
in
two
hours
the
discussion
degenerated
into
an
angry
dispute
heads
became
heated
and
personalities
were
used
even
at
church
during
the
sermon
the
faithful
could
not
listen
to
van
stabel
the
minister
in
patience
and
he
threw
himself
about
in
the
pulpit
and
lectured
his
flock
with
far
more
than
his
usual
severity
at
last
this
state
of
things
brought
about
altercations
more
grave
alas
than
that
between
gustos
and
schut
and
if
they
did
not
require
the
interference
of
the
authorities
it
was
because
the
antagonists
after
returning
home
found
there
with
its
calm
forgetfulness
of
the
offences
offered
and
received
this
peculiarity
could
not
be
observed
by
these
minds
which
were
absolutely
incapable
of
recognizing
what
was
passing
in
them
one
person
only
in
the
town
he
whose
office
the
council
had
thought
of
suppressing
for
thirty
years
michael
passauf
had
remarked
that
this
excitement
which
was
absent
from
private
houses
quickly
revealed
itself
in
public
edifices
and
he
asked
himself
not
without
a
certain
anxiety
what
would
happen
if
this
infection
should
ever
develop
itself
in
the
family
mansions
and
if
the
epidemic
this
was
the
word
he
used
should
extend
through
the
streets
of
the
town
then
there
would
be
no
more
forgetfulness
of
insults
no
more
tranquillity
no
intermission
in
the
delirium
but
a
permanent
inflammation
which
would
inevitably
bring
the
quiquendonians
into
collision
with
each
other
what
would
happen
then
commissary
passauf
asked
himself
in
terror
how
could
these
furious
savages
be
arrested
how
check
these
goaded
temperaments
my
office
would
be
no
longer
a
sinecure
and
the
council
would
be
obliged
to
double
my
salary
unless
it
should
arrest
me
myself
for
disturbing
the
public
peace
these
very
reasonable
fears
began
to
be
realized
the
infection
spread
from
the
theatre
the
church
the
the
academy
the
market
into
private
houses
and
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
after
the
terrible
performance
of
the
huguenots
its
first
symptoms
appeared
in
the
house
of
collaert
the
banker
that
wealthy
personage
gave
a
ball
or
at
least
a
to
the
notabilities
of
the
town
he
had
issued
some
months
before
a
loan
of
thirty
thousand
francs
three
quarters
of
which
had
been
subscribed
and
to
celebrate
this
financial
success
he
had
opened
his
and
given
a
party
to
his
everybody
knows
that
flemish
parties
are
innocent
and
tranquil
enough
the
principal
expense
of
which
is
usually
in
beer
and
syrups
some
conversation
on
the
weather
the
appearance
of
the
crops
the
fine
condition
of
the
gardens
the
care
of
flowers
and
especially
of
tulips
a
slow
and
measured
dance
from
time
to
time
perhaps
a
minuet
sometimes
a
waltz
but
one
of
those
german
waltzes
which
achieve
a
turn
and
a
half
per
minute
and
during
which
the
dancers
hold
each
other
as
far
apart
as
their
arms
will
permit
such
is
the
usual
fashion
of
the
balls
attended
by
the
aristocratic
society
of
quiquendone
the
polka
after
being
altered
to
four
time
had
tried
to
become
accustomed
to
it
but
the
dancers
always
lagged
behind
the
orchestra
no
matter
how
slow
the
measure
and
it
had
to
be
abandoned
these
peaceable
reunions
in
which
the
youths
and
maidens
enjoyed
an
honest
and
moderate
pleasure
had
never
been
attended
by
any
outburst
of
why
then
on
this
evening
at
collaert
the
banker
did
the
syrups
seem
to
be
transformed
into
heady
wines
into
sparkling
champagne
into
heating
punches
why
towards
the
middle
of
the
evening
did
a
sort
of
mysterious
intoxication
take
possession
of
the
guests
why
did
the
minuet
become
a
jig
why
did
the
orchestra
hurry
with
its
harmonies
why
did
the
candles
just
as
at
the
theatre
burn
with
unwonted
refulgence
what
electric
current
invaded
the
banker
how
happened
it
that
the
couples
held
each
other
so
closely
and
clasped
each
other
hands
so
convulsively
that
the
cavaliers
seuls
made
themselves
conspicuous
by
certain
extraordinary
steps
in
that
figure
usually
so
grave
so
solemn
so
majestic
so
very
proper
alas
what
oedipus
could
have
answered
these
unsolvable
questions
commissary
passauf
who
was
present
at
the
party
saw
the
storm
coming
distinctly
but
he
could
not
control
it
or
fly
from
it
and
he
felt
a
kind
of
intoxication
entering
his
own
brain
all
his
physical
and
emotional
faculties
increased
in
intensity
he
was
seen
several
times
to
throw
himself
upon
the
confectionery
and
devour
the
dishes
as
if
he
had
just
broken
a
long
fast
the
animation
of
the
ball
was
increasing
all
this
while
a
long
murmur
like
a
dull
buzzing
escaped
from
all
breasts
they
danced
really
danced
the
feet
were
agitated
by
increasing
frenzy
the
faces
became
as
purple
as
those
of
silenus
the
eyes
shone
like
carbuncles
the
general
fermentation
rose
to
the
highest
pitch
and
when
the
orchestra
thundered
out
the
waltz
in
der
freyschütz
when
this
waltz
so
german
and
with
a
movement
so
slow
was
attacked
with
wild
arms
by
the
musicians
ah
it
was
no
longer
a
waltz
but
an
insensate
whirlwind
a
giddy
rotation
a
gyration
worthy
of
being
led
by
some
mephistopheles
beating
the
measure
with
a
firebrand
then
a
galop
an
infernal
galop
which
lasted
an
hour
without
any
one
being
able
to
stop
it
whirled
off
in
its
windings
across
the
halls
the
the
antechambers
by
the
staircases
from
the
cellar
to
the
garret
of
the
opulent
mansion
the
young
men
and
young
girls
the
fathers
and
mothers
people
of
every
age
of
every
weight

both
sexes

and

and

and
the
commissary
passauf
himself
who
never
could
recall
afterwards
who
had
been
his
partner
on
that
terrible
evening
illustration
it
was
no
longer
a
waltz
but
she
did
not
forget
and
ever
since
that
day
she
has
seen
in
her
dreams
the
fiery
commissary
enfolding
her
in
an
impassioned
embrace
and
she
was

chapter
x
in
which
it
will
be
seen
that
the
epidemic
invades
the
entire
town
and
what
effect
it
produces
during
the
following
months
the
evil
in
place
of
subsiding
became
more
extended
from
private
houses
the
epidemic
spread
into
the
streets
the
town
of
quiquendone
was
no
longer
to
be
recognized
a
phenomenon
yet
stranger
than
those
which
had
already
happened
now
appeared
not
only
the
animal
kingdom
but
the
vegetable
kingdom
itself
became
subject
to
the
mysterious
influence
according
to
the
ordinary
course
of
things
epidemics
are
special
in
their
operation
those
which
attack
humanity
spare
the
animals
and
those
which
attack
the
animals
spare
the
vegetables
a
horse
was
never
inflicted
with
smallpox
nor
a
man
with
the
nor
do
sheep
suffer
from
the
but
here
all
the
laws
of
nature
seemed
to
be
overturned
not
only
were
the
character
temperament
and
ideas
of
the
townsfolk
changed
but
the
domestic
animals
dogs
and
cats
horses
and
cows
asses
and
goats
suffered
from
this
epidemic
influence
as
if
their
habitual
equilibrium
had
been
changed
the
plants
themselves
were
infected
by
a
similar
strange
metamorphosis

the

to

which
measured

nine
feet
in

the
cabbages
were

and
the
mushrooms
umbrellas
the
fruits
did
not
lag
behind
the
vegetables
it
required
two
persons
to
eat
a
strawberry
and
four
to
consume
a

the
grapes
also
attained
the
enormous
proportions
of
those
so
well
depicted
by
poussin
in
his
return
of
the
envoys
to
the
promised

it
required

in

invaded
the
garden

and
stifled
each
other
and
the
tulips
those
dear
liliaceous
plants
so
dear
to
the
flemish
heart
what
emotion
they
must
have
caused
to
their
zealous
cultivators
the
worthy
van
bistrom
nearly
fell
over
backwards
one
day
on
seeing
in
his
garden
an
enormous
tulipa
gesneriana
a
gigantic
monster
whose
cup
afforded
space
to
a
nest
for
a
whole
family
of
robins
the
entire
town
flocked
to
see
this
floral
phenomenon
and
renamed
it
the
tulipa
quiquendonia
but
alas
if
these
plants
these
fruits
these
flowers
grew
visibly
to
the
naked
eye
if
all
the
vegetables
insisted
on
assuming
colossal
proportions
if
the
brilliancy
of
their
colours
and
perfume
intoxicated
the
smell
and
the
sight
they
quickly
withered
the
air
which
they
absorbed
rapidly
exhausted
them
and
they
soon
died
faded
and
dried
up
such
was
the
fate
of
the
famous
tulip
which
after
several
days
of
splendour
became
emaciated
and
fell
lifeless
it
was
soon
the
same
with
the
domestic
animals
from
the
to
the
stable
pig
from
the
canary
in
its
cage
to
the
turkey
of
the
it
must
be
said
that
in
ordinary
times
these
animals
were
not
less
phlegmatic
than
their
masters
the
dogs
and
cats
vegetated
rather
than
lived
they
never
betrayed
a
wag
of
pleasure
nor
a
snarl
of
wrath
their
tails
moved
no
more
than
if
they
had
been
made
of
bronze
such
a
thing
as
a
bite
or
scratch
from
any
of
them
had
not
been
known
from
time
immemorial
as
for
mad
dogs
they
were
looked
upon
as
imaginary
beasts
like
the
griffins
and
the
rest
in
the
menagerie
of
the
apocalypse
but
what
a
change
had
taken
place
in
a
few
months
the
smallest
incidents
of
which
we
are
trying
to
reproduce
dogs
and
cats
began
to
show
teeth
and
claws
several
executions
had
taken
place
after
reiterated
offences
a
horse
was
seen
for
the
first
time
to
take
his
bit
in
his
teeth
and
rush
through
the
streets
of
quiquendone
an
ox
was
observed
to
precipitate
itself
with
lowered
horns
upon
one
of
his
herd
an
ass
was
seen
to
turn
himself
ever
with
his
legs
in

in
the
place

never
brayed
before
a

actually
a
sheep
defended
valiantly
the

from

butcher
knife
van
tricasse
the
burgomaster
was
forced
to
make
police
regulations
concerning
the
domestic
animals
as
seized
with
lunacy
they
rendered
the
streets
of
quiquendone
unsafe
but
alas
if
the
animals
were
mad
the
men
were
scarcely
less
so
no
age
was
spared
by
the
scourge
babies
soon
became
quite
insupportable
though
till
now
so
easy
to
bring
up
and
for
the
first
time
honoré
syntax
the
judge
was
obliged
to
apply
the
rod
to
his
youthful
offspring
there
was
a
kind
of
insurrection
at
the
high
school
and
the
dictionaries
became
formidable
missiles
in
the
classes
the
scholars
would
not
submit
to
be
shut
in
and
besides
the
infection
took
the
teachers
themselves
who
overwhelmed
the
boys
and
girls
with
extravagant
tasks
and
punishments
another
strange
phenomenon
occurred
all
these
quiquendonians
so
sober
before
whose
chief
food
had
been
whipped
creams
committed
wild
excesses
in
their
eating
and
drinking
their
usual
regimen
no
longer
sufficed
each
stomach
was
transformed
into
a
gulf
and
it
became
necessary
to
fill
this
gulf
by
the
most
energetic
means
the
consumption
of
the
town
was
trebled
instead
of
two
repasts
they
had
six
many
cases
of
indigestion
were
reported
the
counsellor
niklausse
could
not
satisfy
his
hunger
van
tricasse
found
it
impossible
to
assuage
his
thirst
and
remained
in
a
state
of
rabid
in
short
the
most
alarming
symptoms
manifested
themselves
and
increased
from
day
to
day
drunken
people
staggered
in
the
streets
and
these
were
often
citizens
of
high
position
dominique
custos
the
physician
had
plenty
to
do
with
the
heartburns
inflammations
and
nervous
affections
which
proved
to
what
a
strange
degree
the
nerves
of
the
people
had
been
irritated
there
were
daily
quarrels
and
altercations
in
the
once
deserted
but
now
crowded
streets
of
quiquendone
for
nobody
could
any
longer
stay
at
home
it
was
necessary
to
establish
a
new
police
force
to
control
the
disturbers
of
the
public
peace
a
was
established
in
the

and
speedily
became
full
night
and
day
of
refractory
offenders
commissary
passauf
was
in
despair
a
marriage
was
concluded
in
less
than
two
months
such
a
thing
had
never
been
seen
before
yes
the
son
of
rupp
the
schoolmaster
wedded
the
daughter
of
augustine
de
rovere
and
that
days
only
after
he
had
petitioned
for
her
hand
and
heart
other
marriages
were
decided
upon
which
in
old
times
would
have
remained
in
doubt
and
discussion
for
years
the
burgomaster
perceived
that
his
own
daughter
the
charming
suzel
was
escaping
from
his
hands
as
for
dear
tatanémance
she
had
dared
to
sound
commissary

on
the
subject
of
a
union
which
seemed
to
her
to
combine
every
element
of
happiness
fortune
honour
youth
at
last
to
reach
the
depths
of
abomination
a
duel
took
place
yes
a
duel
with
pistols
at
paces
with
and
between
whom
our
readers
will
never
believe
between
frantz
niklausse
the
gentle
angler
and
young
simon
collaert
the
wealthy
banker
son
and
the
cause
of
this
duel
was
the
burgomaster
daughter
for
whom
simon
discovered
himself
to
be
fired
with
passion
and
whom
he
refused
to
yield
to
the
claims
of
an
audacious
rival
chapter
xi
in
which
the
quiquendonians
adopt
a
heroic
resolution
we
have
seen
to
what
a
deplorable
condition
the
people
of
quiquendone
were
reduced
their
heads
were
in
a
ferment
they
no
longer
knew
or
recognized
themselves
the
most
peaceable
citizens
had
become
quarrelsome
if
you
looked
at
them
askance
they
would
speedily
send
you
a
challenge
some
let
their
moustaches
grow
and
several
the
most
belligerent
curled
them
up
at
the
ends
this
being
their
condition
the
administration
of
the
town
and
the
maintenance
of
order
in
the
streets
became
difficult
tasks
for
the
government
had
not
been
organized
for
such
a
state
of
things
the
burgomaster
that
worthy
van
tricasse
whom
we
have
seen
so
placid
so
dull
so
incapable
of
coming
to
any
decision
the
burgomaster
became
intractable
his
house
resounded
with
the
sharpness
of
his
voice
he
made
twenty
decisions
a
day
scolding
his
officials
and
himself
enforcing
the
regulations
of
his
administration
ah
what
a
change
the
amiable
and
tranquil
mansion
of
the
burgomaster
that
good
flemish
home
where
was
its
former
calm
what
changes
had
taken
place
in
your
household
economy
madame
van
tricasse
had
become
acrid
whimsical
harsh
her
husband
sometimes
succeeded
in
drowning
her
voice
by
talking
louder
than
she
but
could
not
silence
her
the
petulant
humour
of
this
worthy
dame
was
excited
by
everything
nothing
went
right
the
servants
offended
her
every
moment
tatanémance
her
who
was
not
less
irritable
replied
sharply
to
her
van
tricasse
naturally
supported
lotchè
his
servant
as
is
the
case
in
all
good
households
and
this
permanently
exasperated
madame
who
constantly
disputed
discussed
and
made
scenes
with
her
husband
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
us
cried
the
unhappy
burgomaster
what
is
this
fire
that
is
devouring
us
are
we
possessed
with
the
devil
ah
madame
van
tricasse
madame
van
tricasse
you
will
end
by
making
me
die
before
you
and
thus
violate
all
the
traditions
of
the
family
the
reader
will
not
have
forgotten
the
strange
custom
by
which
van
tricasse
would
become
a
widower
and
marry
again
so
as
not
to
break
the
chain
of
descent
meanwhile
this
disposition
of
all
minds
produced
other
curious
effects
worthy
of
note
this
excitement
the
cause
of
which
has
so
far
escaped
us
brought
about
unexpected
physiological
changes
talents
hitherto
unrecognized
betrayed
themselves
aptitudes
were
suddenly
revealed
artists
before
displayed
new
ability
politicians
and
authors
arose
orators
proved
themselves
equal
to
the
most
arduous
debates
and
on
every
question
inflamed
audiences
which
were
quite
ready
to
be
inflamed
from
the
sessions
of
the
council
this
movement
spread
to
the
public
political
meetings
and
a
club
was
formed
at
quiquendone
whilst
twenty
newspapers
the
quiquendone
signal
the
quiquendone
impartial
the
quiquendone
radical
and
so
on
written
in
an
inflammatory
style
raised
the
most
important
questions
but
what
about
you
will
ask
apropos
of
everything
and
of
nothing
apropos
of
the
oudenarde
tower
which
was
falling
and
which
some
wished
to
pull
down
and
others
to
prop
up
apropos
of
the
police
regulations
issued
by
the
council
which
some
obstinate
citizens
threatened
to
resist
apropos
of
the
sweeping
of
the
gutters
repairing
the
sewers
and
so
on
nor
did
the
enraged
orators
confine
themselves
to
the
internal
administration
of
the
town
carried
on
by
the
current
they
went
further
and
essayed
to
plunge
their
into
the
hazards
of
war
quiquendone
had
had
for
eight
or
nine
hundred
years
a
of
the
best
quality
but
she
had
preciously
laid
it
up
like
a
relic
and
there
had
seemed
some
probability
that
it
would
become
effete
and
no
longer
serviceable
this
was
what
had
given
rise
to
the
it
is
not
generally
known
that
quiquendone
in
this
cosy
corner
of
flanders
lies
next
to
the
little
town
of
virgamen
the
territories
of
the
two
communities
are
contiguous

which
was

let
it
be
observed
audaciously
ventured
to
pasture
on
the
territory
of
quiquendone
this
unfortunate
beast
had
scarcely
eaten
three
mouthfuls
but
the
offence
the
abuse
the
crime
whatever
you
will
was
committed
and
duly
indicted
for
the
magistrates
at
that
time
had
already
begun
to
know
how
to
write
we
will
take
revenge
at
the
proper
moment
said
simply
natalis
van
tricasse
the
predecessor
of
the
burgomaster
of
this
story
and
the
virgamenians
will
lose
nothing
by
waiting
the
virgamenians
were
forewarned
they
waited
thinking
without
doubt
that
the
remembrance
of
the
offence
would
fade
away
with
the
lapse
of
time
and
really
for
several
centuries
they
lived
on
good
terms
with
their
neighbours
of
quiquendone
but
they
counted
without
their
hosts
or
rather
without
this
strange
epidemic
which
radically
changing
the
character
of
the
quiquendonians
aroused
their
dormant
vengeance
it
was
at
the
club
of
the
rue
monstrelet
that
the
truculent
orator
schut
abruptly
introducing
the
subject
to
his
hearers
inflamed
them
with
the
expressions
and
metaphors
used
on
such
occasions
he
recalled
the
offence
the
injury
which
had
been
done
to
quiquendone
and
which
a
nation
jealous
of
its
rights
could
not
admit
as
a
precedent
he
showed
the
insult
to
be
still
existing
the
wound
still
bleeding
he
spoke
of
certain
special
on
the
part
of
the
people
of
virgamen
which
indicated
in
what
degree
of
contempt
they
regarded
the
people
of
quiquendone
he
appealed
to
his
who
unconsciously
perhaps
had
supported
this
mortal
insult
for
long
centuries
he
adjured
the
children
of
the
ancient
town
to
have
no
other
purpose
than
to
obtain
a
substantial
reparation
and
lastly
he
made
an
appeal
to
all
the
living
energies
of
the
nation
with
what
enthusiasm
these
words
so
new
to
quiquendonian
ears
were
greeted
may
be
surmised
but
can
not
be
told
all
the
auditors
rose
and
with
extended
arms
demanded
war
with
loud
cries
never
had
the
advocate
schut
achieved
such
a
success
and
it
must
be
avowed
that
his
triumphs
were
not
few
the
burgomaster
the
counsellor
all
the
notabilities
present
at
this
memorable
meeting
would
have
vainly
attempted
to
resist
the
popular
outburst
besides
they
had
no
desire
to
do
so
and
cried
as
loud
if
not
louder
than
the
rest
to
the
frontier
to
the
frontier
as
the
frontier
was
but
three
kilometers
from
the
walls
of
quiquendone
it
is
certain
that
the
virgamenians
ran
a
real
danger
for
they
might
easily
be
invaded
without
having
had
time
to
look
about
them
meanwhile
josse
liefrinck
the
worthy
chemist
who
alone
had
preserved
his
senses
on
this
grave
occasion
tried
to
make
his
comprehend
that
guns
cannon
and
generals
were
equally
wanting
to
their
design
they
replied
to
him
not
without
many
impatient
gestures
that
these
generals
cannons
and
guns
would
be
improvised
that
the
right
and
love
of
country
sufficed
and
rendered
a
people
irresistible
hereupon
the
burgomaster
himself
came
forward
and
in
a
sublime
harangue
made
short
work
of
those
pusillanimous
people
who
disguise
their
fear
under
a
veil
of
prudence
which
veil
he
tore
off
with
a
patriotic
hand
at
this
sally
it
seemed
as
if
the
hall
would
fall
in
under
the
applause
the
vote
was
eagerly
demanded
and
was
taken
amid
acclamations
the
cries
of
to
virgamen
to
virgamen
redoubled
illustration
to
virgamen
to
virgamen
the
burgomaster
then
took
it
upon
himself
to
put
the
armies
in
motion
and
in
the
name
of
the
town
he
promised
the
honours
of
a
triumph
such
as
was
given
in
the
times
of
the
romans
to
that
one
of
its
generals
who
should
return
victorious
meanwhile
josse
liefrinck
who
was
an
obstinate
fellow
and
did
not
regard
himself
as
beaten
though
he
really
had
been
insisted
on
making
another
observation
he
wished
to
remark
that
the
triumph
was
only
accorded
at
rome
to
those
victorious
generals
who
had
killed
five
thousand
of
the
enemy
well
well
cried
the
meeting
deliriously
and
as
the
population
of
the
town
of
virgamen
consists
of
but
three
thousand
five
hundred
and
inhabitants
it
would
be
difficult
unless
the
same
person
was
killed
several
times
but
they
did
not
let
the
luckless
logician
finish
and
he
was
turned
out

and
bruised

pulmacher
the
grocer
who
usually
sold
groceries
by
retail
whatever
this
cowardly
apothecary
may
have
said
i
engage
by
myself
to
kill
five
thousand
virgamenians
if
you
will
accept
my
services
five
thousand
five
hundred
cried
a
yet
more
resolute
patriot
six

six

retorted
the
grocer
seven
thousand
cried
jean

the
confectioner
of
the
rue

who
was
on
the
road
to
a
fortune
by
making
whipped
creams
adjudged
exclaimed
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
on
finding
that
no
one
else
rose
on
the
bid
and
this
was
how
jean
orbideck
the
confectioner
became

not
right
see
to
what
not
only
the
physical
developments
of
a
whole
nation
but
its
morality
its
dignity
its
talents
its
political
sense
have
come
it
is
only
a
question
of
molecules
no
doubt
but
but
do
you
not
think
that
matters
have
gone
far
enough
and
that
these
poor
devils
should
not
be
excited
beyond
measure
no
no
cried
the
doctor
no
i
will
go
on
to
the
end
as
you
will
master
the
experiment
however
seems
to
me
conclusive
and
i
think
it
time
to
to
to
close
the
valve
you
better

doctor

if
you
attempt

throttle
you
chapter
xiii
in
which
it
is
once
more
proved
that
by
taking
high
ground
all
human
littlenesses
may
be
overlooked
you
say
asked
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
of
the
counsellor
niklausse
i
say
that
this
war
is
necessary
replied
niklausse
firmly
and
that
the
time
has
come
to
avenge
this
insult
well
i
repeat
to
you
replied
the
burgomaster
tartly
that
if
the
people
of
quiquendone
do
not
profit
by
this
occasion
to
vindicate
their
rights
they
will
be
unworthy
of
their
name
and
as
for
me
i
maintain
that
we
ought
without
delay
to
collect
our
forces
and
lead
them
to
the
front
really
monsieur
really
replied
van
tricasse
and
do
you
speak
thus
to
to
yourself
monsieur
the
burgomaster
and
you
shall
hear
the
truth
unwelcome
as
it
may
be
and
you
shall
hear
it
yourself
counsellor
returned
van
tricasse
in
a
passion
for
it
will
come
better
from
my
mouth
than
from
yours
yes
monsieur
yes
any
delay
would
be
dishonourable
the
town
of
quiquendone
has
waited
nine
hundred
years
for
the
moment
to
take
its
revenge
and
whatever
you
may
say
whether
it
pleases
you
or
not
we
shall
march
upon
the
enemy
ah
you
take
it
thus
replied
niklausse
harshly
very
well
monsieur
we
will
march
without
you
if
it
does
not
please
you
to
go
a
burgomaster
place
is
in
the
front
rank
monsieur
illustration
a
burgomaster
place
is
in
the
front
rank
monsieur
and
that
of
a
counsellor
also
monsieur
you
insult
me
by
thwarting
all
my
wishes
cried
the
burgomaster
whose
fists
seemed
likely
to
hit
out
before
long
and
you
insult
me
equally
by
doubting
my
patriotism
cried
niklausse
who
was
equally
ready
for
a
tussle
i
tell
you
monsieur
that
the
army
of
quiquendone
shall
be
put
in
motion
within
two
days
and
i
repeat
to
you
monsieur
that
hours
shall
not
pass
before
we
shall
have
marched
upon
the
enemy
it
is
easy
to
see
from
this
fragment
of
conversation
that
the
two
speakers
supported
exactly
the
same
idea
both
wished
for
hostilities
but
as
their
excitement
disposed
them
to
altercation
niklausse
would
not
listen
to
van
tricasse
nor
van
tricasse
to
niklausse
had
they
been
of
contrary
opinions
on
this
grave
question
had
the
burgomaster
favoured
war
and
the
counsellor
insisted
on
peace
the
quarrel
would
not
have
been
more
violent
these
two
old
friends
gazed
fiercely
at
each
other
by
the
quickened
beating
of
their
hearts
their
red
faces
their
contracted
pupils
the
trembling
of
their
muscles
their
harsh
voices
it
might
be
conjectured
that
they
were
ready
to
come
to
blows
but
the
striking
of
a
large
clock
happily
checked
the
adversaries
at
the
moment
when
they
seemed
on
the
point
of
assaulting
each
other
at
last
the
hour
has
come
cried
the
burgomaster
what
hour
asked
the
counsellor
the
hour
to
go
to
the
belfry
tower
it
is
true
and
whether
it
pleases
you
or
not
i
shall
go
monsieur
and
i
too
let
us
go
let
us
go
it
might
have
been
supposed
from
these
last
words
that
a
collision
had
occurred
and
that
the
adversaries
were
proceeding
to
a
duel
but
it
was
not
so
it
had
been
agreed
that
the
burgomaster
and
the
counsellor
as
the
two
principal
dignitaries
of
the
town
should
repair
to
the
town
hall
and
there
show
themselves
on
the
high
tower
which
overlooked
quiquendone
that
they
should
examine
the
surrounding
country
so
as
to
make
the
best
strategetic
plan
for
the
advance
of
their
troops
though
they
were
in
accord
on
this
subject
they
did
not
cease
to
quarrel
bitterly
as
they
went
their
loud
voices
were
heard
resounding
in
the
streets
but
all
the
were
now
accustomed
to
this
the
exasperation
of
the
dignitaries
seemed
quite
natural
and
no
one
took
notice
of
it
under
the
circumstances
a
calm
man
would
have
been
regarded
as
a
monster
the
burgomaster
and
the
counsellor
having
reached
the
porch
of
the
belfry
were
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
they
were
no
longer
red
but
pale
this
terrible
discussion
though
they
had
the
same
idea
had
produced
internal
spasms
and
every
one
knows
that
paleness
shows
that
anger
has
reached
its
last
limits
at
the
foot
of
the
narrow
tower
staircase
there
was
a
real
explosion
who
should
go
up
first
who
should
first
creep
up
the
winding
steps
truth
compels
us
to
say
that
there
was
a
tussle
and
that
the
counsellor
niklausse
forgetful
of
all
that
he
owed
to
his
superior
to
the
supreme
magistrate
of
the
town
pushed
van
tricasse
violently
back
and
dashed
up
the
staircase
first
both
ascended
denouncing
and
raging
at
each
other
at
every
step
it
was
to
be
feared
that
a
terrible
climax
would
occur
on
the
summit
of
the
tower
which
rose
three
hundred
and
feet
above
the
pavement
the
two
enemies
soon
got
out
of
breath
however
and
in
a
little
while
at
the
eightieth
step
they
began
to
move
up
heavily
breathing
loud
and
short
then
was
it
because
of
their
being
out
of
breath
their
wrath
subsided
or
at
least
only
betrayed
itself
by
a
succession
of
unseemly
epithets
they
became
silent
and
strange
to
say
it
seemed
as
if
their
excitement
diminished
as
they
ascended
higher
above
the
town
a
sort
of
lull
took
place
in
their
minds
their
brains
became
cooler
and
simmered
down
like
a
when
taken
away
from
the
fire
why
we
can
not
answer
this
why
but
the
truth
is
that
having
reached
a
certain
two
hundred
and
feet
above
ground
the
two
adversaries
sat
down
and
really
more
calm
looked
at
each
other
without
any
anger
in
their
faces
how
high
it
is
said
the
burgomaster
passing
his
handkerchief
over
his
rubicund
face
very
high
returned
the
counsellor
do
you
know
that
we
have
gone
fourteen
feet
higher
than
the
church
of
saint
michael
at
hamburg
i
know
it
replied
the
burgomaster
in
a
tone
of
vanity
very
pardonable
in
the
chief
magistrate
of
quiquendone
the
two
notabilities
soon
resumed
their
ascent
casting
curious
glances
through
the
loopholes
pierced
in
the
tower
walls
the
burgomaster
had
taken
the
head
of
the
procession
without
any
remark
on
the
part
of
the
counsellor
it
even
happened
that
at
about
the
three
hundred
and
fourth
step
van
tricasse
being
completely
tired
out
niklausse
kindly
pushed
him
from
behind
the
burgomaster
offered
no
resistance
to
this
and
when
he
reached
the
platform
of
the
tower
said
graciously
thanks
niklausse
i
will
do
the
same
for
you
one
day
a
little
while
before
it
had
been
two
wild
beasts
ready
to
tear
each
other
to
pieces
who
had
presented
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
it
was
now
two
friends
who
reached
its
summit
the
weather
was
superb
it
was
the
month
of
may
the
sun
had
absorbed
all
the
vapours
what
a
pure
and
limpid
atmosphere
the
most
minute
objects
over
a
broad
space
might
be
discerned
the
walls
of
virgamen
glistening
in
their
whiteness
its
red
pointed
roofs
its
belfries
shining
in
the
sunlight
appeared
a
few
miles
off
and
this
was
the
town
that
was
foredoomed
to
all
the
horrors
of
fire
and
pillage
the
burgomaster
and
the
counsellor
sat
down
beside
each
other
on
a
small
stone
bench
like
two
worthy
people
whose
souls
were
in
close
sympathy
as
they
recovered
breath
they
looked
around
then
after
a
brief
silence
how
fine
this
is
cried
the
burgomaster
yes
it
is
admirable
replied
the
counsellor
does
it
not
seem
to
you
my
good
van
tricasse
that
humanity
is
destined
to
dwell
rather
at
such
heights
than
to
crawl
about
on
the
surface
of
our
globe
i
agree
with
you
honest
niklausse
returned
the
burgomaster
i
agree
with
you
you
seize
sentiment
better
when
you
get
clear
of
nature
you
breathe
it
in
every
sense
it
is
at
such
heights
that
philosophers
should
be
formed
and
that
sages
should
live
above
the
miseries
of
this
world
shall
we
go
around
the
platform
asked
the
counsellor
let
us
go
around
the
platform
replied
the
burgomaster
and
the
two
friends
arm
in
arm
and
putting
as
formerly
long
pauses
between
their
questions
and
answers
examined
every
point
of
the
horizon
illustration
the
two
friends
arm
in
arm
it
is
at
least
seventeen
years
since
i
have
ascended
the
belfry
tower
said
van
tricasse
i
do
not
think
i
ever
came
up
before
replied
niklausse
and
i
regret
it
for
the
view
from
this
height
is
sublime
do
you
see
my
friend
the
pretty
stream
of
the
vaar
as
it
winds
among
the
trees
and
beyond
the
heights
of
saint
hermandad
how
gracefully
they
shut
in
the
horizon
observe
that
border
of
green
trees
which
nature
has
so
picturesquely
arranged
ah
nature
nature
niklausse
could
the
hand
of
man
ever
hope
to
rival
her
it
is
enchanting
my
excellent
friend
replied
the
counsellor
see
the
flocks
and
herds
lying
in
the
verdant
pastures
the
oxen
the
cows
the
sheep
and
the
labourers
going
to
the
fields
you
would
say
they
were
arcadian
shepherds
they
only
want
a
bagpipe
and
over
all
this
fertile
country
the
beautiful
blue
sky
which
no
vapour
dims
ah
niklausse
one
might
become
a
poet
here
i
do
not
understand
why
saint
simeon
stylites
was
not
one
of
the
greatest
poets
of
the
world
it
was
because
perhaps
his
column
was
not
high
enough
replied
the
counsellor
with
a
gentle
smile
at
this
moment
the
chimes
of
quiquendone
rang
out
the
clear
bells
played
one
of
their
most
melodious
airs
the
two
friends
listened
in
ecstasy
then
in
his
calm
voice
van
tricasse
said
but
what
friend
niklausse
did
we
come
to
the
top
of
this
tower
to
do
in
fact
replied
the
counsellor
we
have
permitted
ourselves
to
be
carried
away
by
our
reveries
what
did
we
come
here
to
do
repeated
the
burgomaster
we
came
said
niklausse
to
breathe
this
pure
air
which
human
weaknesses
have
not
corrupted
well
shall
we
descend
friend
niklausse
let
us
descend
friend
van
tricasse
they
gave
a
parting
glance
at
the
splendid
panorama
which
was
spread
before
their
eyes
then
the
burgomaster
passed
down
first
and
began
to
descend
with
a
slow
and
measured
pace
the
counsellor
followed
a
few
steps
behind
they
reached
the
at
which
they
had
stopped
on
ascending
already
their
cheeks
began
to
redden
they
tarried
a
moment
then
resumed
their
descent
in
a
few
moments
van
tricasse
begged
niklausse
to
go
more
slowly
as
he
felt
him
on
his
heels
and
it
worried
him
it
even
did
more
than
worry
him
for
twenty
steps
lower
down
he
ordered
the
counsellor
to
stop
that
he
might
get
on
some
distance
ahead
the
counsellor
replied
that
he
did
not
wish
to
remain
with
his
leg
in
the
air
to
await
the
good
pleasure
of
the
burgomaster
and
kept
on
van
tricasse
retorted
with
a
rude
expression
the
counsellor
responded
by
an
insulting
allusion
to
the
burgomaster
age
destined
as
he
was
by
his
family
traditions
to
marry
a
second
time
the
burgomaster
went
down
twenty
steps
more
and
warned
niklausse
that
this
should
not
pass
thus
niklausse
replied
that
at
all
events
he
would
pass
down
first
and
the
space
being
very
narrow
the
two
dignitaries
came
into
collision
and
found
themselves
in
utter
darkness
the
words
blockhead
and
booby
were
the
mildest
which
they
now
applied
to
each
other
we
shall
see
stupid
beast
cried
the
burgomaster
we
shall
see
what
figure
you
will
make
in
this
war
and
in
what
rank
you
will
march
in
the
rank
that
precedes
yours
you
silly
old
fool
replied
niklausse
then
there
were
other
cries
and
it
seemed
as
if
bodies
were
rolling
over
each
other
what
was
going
on
why
were
these
dispositions
so
quickly
changed
why
were
the
gentle
sheep
of
the
tower
summit
metamorphosed
into
tigers
two
hundred
feet
below
it
however
this
might
be
the
guardian
of
the
tower
hearing
the
noise
opened
the
door
just
at
the
moment
when
the
two
adversaries
bruised
and
with
protruding
eyes
were
in
the
act
of
tearing
each
other
hair
fortunately
they
wore
wigs
you
shall
give
me
satisfaction
for
this
cried
the
burgomaster
shaking
his
fist
under
his
adversary
nose
whenever
you
please
growled
the
counsellor
niklausse
attempting
to
respond
with
a
vigorous
kick
the
guardian
who
was
himself
in
a
passion
i
can
not
say
why
thought
the
scene
a
very
natural
one
i
know
not
what
excitement
urged
him
to
take
part
in
it
but
he
controlled
himself
and
went
off
to
announce
throughout
the
neighbourhood
that
a
hostile
meeting
was
about
to
take
place
between
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
and
the
counsellor
niklausse
chapter
xiv
in
which
matters
go
so
far
that
the
inhabitants
of
quiquendone
the
reader
and
even
the
author
demand
an
immediate
dénouement
the
last
incident
proves
to
what
a
pitch
of
excitement
the
quiquendonians
had
been
wrought
the
two
oldest
friends
in
the
town
and
the
most
gentle
before
the
advent
of
the
epidemic
to
reach
this
degree
of
violence
and
that
too
only
a
few
minutes
after
their
old
mutual
sympathy
their
amiable
instincts
their
contemplative
habit
had
been
restored
at
the
summit
of
the
tower
on
learning
what
was
going
on
doctor
ox
could
not
contain
his
joy
he
resisted
the
arguments
which
ygène
who
saw
what
a
serious
turn
affairs
were
taking
addressed
to
him
besides
both
of
them
were
infected
by
the
general
fury
they
were
not
less
excited
than
the
rest
of
the
population
and
they
ended
by
quarrelling
as
violently
as
the
burgomaster
and
the
counsellor
besides
one
question
eclipsed
all
others
and
the
intended
duels
were
postponed
to
the
issue
of
the
virgamenian
difficulty
no
man
had
the
right
to
shed
his
blood
uselessly
when
it
belonged
to
the
last
drop
to
his
country
in
danger
the
affair
was
in
short
a
grave
one
and
there
was
no
withdrawing
from
it
the
burgomaster
van
tricasse
despite
the
warlike
ardour
with
which
he
was
filled
had
not
thought
it
best
to
throw
himself
upon
the
enemy
without
warning
him
he
had
therefore
through
the
medium
of
the
rural
policeman
hottering
sent
to
demand
reparation
of
the
virgamenians
for
the
offence
committed
in
on
the
quiquendonian
territory
the
authorities
of
virgamen
could
not
at
first
imagine
of
what
the
envoy
spoke
and
the
latter
despite
his
official
character
was
conducted
back
to
the
frontier
very
cavalierly
van
tricasse
then
sent
one
of
the
of
the
citizen
hildevert
shuman
a
manufacturer
of
a
very
firm
and
energetic
man
who
carried
to
the
authorities
of
virgamen
the
original
minute
of
the
indictment
drawn
up
in
by
order
of
the
burgomaster
natalís
van
tricasse
the
authorities
of
virgamen
burst
out
laughing
and
served
the
in
the
same
manner
as
the
rural
policeman
the
burgomaster
then
assembled
the
dignitaries
of
the
town
a
letter
remarkably
and
vigorously
drawn
up
was
written
as
an
ultimatum
the
cause
of
quarrel
was
plainly
stated
and
a
delay
of
hours
was
accorded
to
the
guilty
city
in
which
to
repair
the
outrage
done
to
quiquendone
the
letter
was
sent
off
and
returned
a
few
hours
afterwards
torn
to
bits
which
made
so
many
fresh
insults
the
virgamenians
knew
of
old
the
forbearance
and
equanimity
of
the
quiquendonians
and
made
sport
of
them
and
their
demand
of
their
and
their
there
was
only
one
thing
left
to
do
to
have
recourse
to
arms
to
invoke
the
god
of
battles
and
after
the
prussian
fashion
to
hurl
themselves
upon
the
virgamenians
before
the
latter
could
be
prepared
this
decision
was
made
by
the
council
in
solemn
conclave
in
which
cries
objurgations
and
menacing
gestures
were
mingled
with
unexampled
violence
an
assembly
of
idiots
a
congress
of
madmen
a
club
of
maniacs
would
not
have
been
more
tumultuous
as
soon
as
the
declaration
of
war
was
known
general
jean
orbideck
assembled
his
troops
perhaps
two
thousand
three
hundred
and
combatants
from
a
population
of
two
thousand
three
hundred
and
souls
the
women
the
children
the
old
men
were
joined
with
the
males
the
guns
of
the
town
had
been
put
under
requisition
five
had
been
found
two
of
which
were
without
cocks
and
these
had
been
distributed
to

composed
of
the
old
culverin
of
the
château
taken
in
at
the
attack
on
quesnoy
one
of
the
first
occasions
of
the
use
of
cannon
in
history
and
which
had
not
been
fired
off
for
five
centuries
happily
for
those
who
were
appointed
to
take
it
in
charge
there
were
no
projectiles
with
which
to
load
it
but
such
as
it
was
this
engine
might
well
impose
on
the
enemy
as
for
they
had
been
taken
from
the
museum
of
antiquities
flint
hatchets
helmets
frankish
javelins
halberds
rapiers
and
so
on
and
also
in
those
domestic
arsenals
commonly
known
as
cupboards
and
kitchens
but
courage
the
right
hatred
of
the
foreigner
the
yearning
for
vengeance
were
to
take
the
place
of
more
perfect
engines
and
to
replace
at
least
it
was
hoped
so
the
modern
mitrailleuses
and
the

were
passed
in

thrown
three
times
in

of

but
he
got
up
again
without

this
was
regarded
as
a
favourable
omen

the
chief

the

were
no

shed
either
by

urged
on

the
dénouement
takes
place
when
a
formidable
explosion
resounded
all
the
atmosphere
which
enveloped
quiquendone
seemed
on
fire
a
flame
of
an
intensity
and
vividness
quite
unwonted
shot
up
into
the
heavens
like
a
meteor
had
it
been
night
this
flame
would
have
been
visible
for
ten
leagues
around
the
whole
army
of
quiquendone
fell
to
the
earth
like
an
army
of
monks
happily
there
were
no
victims
a

scratches
and
slight

were
the
only
result
the

fell
to

what
had
happened
something
very
simple
as
was
soon
learned
the
gasworks
had
just
blown
up
during
the
absence
of
the
doctor
and
his
assistant
some
careless
mistake
had
no

been
made
it
is
not

how
or
why
a
communication
had
been
established
between
the
reservoir
which
contained
the
oxygen
and
that
which
enclosed
the

an
explosive
mixture
had
resulted
from
the
union
of
these
two
gases
to
which
fire

accidentally
been

changed
everything

got

again

the

sees
that

immediately
became

formerly

indeed
did
not
cause
a
very
lively

took
his

tranquilly
noiselessly

being

having
already

their
revenge
the
general
returned
to
his
confections
and
his

everything
had
become
calm
again

old
existence
had
been
resumed
by
men

beasts
beasts
and

even
by
the
tower
of

which
the

these
explosions
are
sometimes
astonishing
had
set
upright

from
that

never
a

was
spoken
more
loudly
than

never
a

no

the
post
of
the
commissary
passauf
became
once
more
a
sinecure

if
his
salary
was
not
reduced
it
was
because
the
burgomaster
and
the
counsellor
could
not
make
up
their
minds
to
decide
upon
it
from
time

passauf
flitted
without
any

suspecting
it
through
the
dreams
of

inconsolable

then

a
fantastic
experiment

had

the

you
scarcely
return
to
the
ordinary

before
you
return
to
your
usual
state
for
instance
the
counsellor
and
the
burgomaster
at
the
top
of
the
belfry
were
themselves
again
as
the

is
kept
by

transforms
the

as

a
madman

was
fortunate
then
for
the
quiquendonians
that
a
providential

put
an
end
to
this
dangerous
experiment
and
abolished

conclude
are

are
all

only
a

such
is

but
we
are
not
bound
to
accept
it
and
for
ourselves
we
utterly
reject
it
in
spite
of
the
curious
experiment
of
which
the
worthy
old
town
of
quiquendone
was
the
theatre
master

chapter
i
a
winter
night
the
city
of
geneva
lies
at
the
west
end
of
the
lake
of
the
same
name
the
rhone
which
passes
through
the
town
at
the
outlet
of
the
lake
divides
it
into
two
sections
and
is
itself
divided
in
the
centre
of
the
city
by
an
island
placed
in
a
topographical
feature
like
this
is
often
found
in
the
great
depôts
of
commerce
and
industry
no
doubt
the
first
inhabitants
were
influenced
by
the
easy
means
of
transport
which
the
swift
currents
of
the
rivers
offered
them
those
roads
which
walk
along
of
their
own
accord
as
pascal
puts
it
in
the
case
of
the
rhone
it
would
be
the
road
that
ran
along
before
new
and
regular
buildings
were
constructed
on
this
island
which
was
enclosed
like
a
dutch
galley
in
the
middle
of
the
river
the
curious
mass
of
houses
piled
one
on
the
other
presented
a
delightfully
confused
the
small
area
of
the
island
had
compelled
some
of
the
buildings
to
be
perched
as
it
were
on
the
piles
which
were
entangled
in
the
rough
currents
of
the
river
the
huge
beams
blackened
by
time
and
worn
by
the
water
seemed
like
the
claws
of
an
enormous
crab
and
presented
a
fantastic
appearance
the
little
yellow
streams
which
were
like
cobwebs
stretched
amid
this
ancient
foundation
quivered
in
the
darkness
as
if
they
had
been
the
leaves
of
some
old
oak
forest
while
the
river
engulfed
in
this
forest
of
piles
foamed
and
roared
most
mournfully
one
of
the
houses
of
the
island
was
striking
for
its
curiously
aged
appearance
it
was
the
dwelling
of
the
old
clockmaker
master
zacharius
whose
household
consisted
of
his
daughter
gerande
aubert
thun
his
apprentice
and
his
old
servant
scholastique
there
was
no
man
in
geneva
to
compare
in
interest
with
this
zacharius
his
age
was
past
finding
out
not
the
oldest
inhabitant
of
the
town
could
tell
for
how
long
his
thin
pointed
head
had
shaken
above
his
shoulders
nor
the
day
when
for
the
first
time
he
through
the
streets
with
his
long
white
locks
floating
in
the
wind
the
man
did
not
live
he
vibrated
like
the
pendulum
of
his
clocks
his
spare
and
cadaverous
figure
was
always
clothed
in
dark
colours
like
the
pictures
of
leonardo
di
vinci
he
was
sketched
in
black
gerande
had
the
pleasantest
room
in
the
whole
house
whence
through
a
narrow
window
she
had
the
inspiriting
view
of
the
snowy
peaks
of
jura
but
the
bedroom
and
workshop
of
the
old
man
were
a
kind
of
cavern
close
on
to
the
water
the
floor
of
which
rested
on
the
piles
from
time
immemorial
master
zacharius
had
never
come
out
except
at
meal
times
and
when
he
went
to
regulate
the
different
clocks
of
the
town
he
passed
the
rest
of
his
time
at
his
bench
which
was
covered
with
numerous
clockwork
instruments
most
of
which
he
had
invented
himself
for
he
was
a
clever
man
his
works
were
valued
in
all
france
and
germany
the
best
workers
in
geneva
readily
recognized
his
superiority
and
showed
that
he
was
an
honour
to
the
town
by
saying
to
him
belongs
the
glory
of
having
invented
the
escapement
in
fact
the
birth
of
true
dates
from
the
invention
which
the
talents
of
zacharius
had
discovered
not
many
years
before
after
he
had
worked
hard
for
a
long
time
zacharius
would
slowly
put
his
tools
away
cover
up
the
delicate
pieces
that
he
had
been
adjusting
with
glasses
and
stop
the
active
wheel
of
his
lathe
then
he
would
raise
a
constructed
in
the
floor
of
his
workshop
and
stooping
down
used
to
inhale
for
hours
together
the
thick
vapours
of
the
rhone
as
it
dashed
along
under
his
eyes
illustration
he
would
raise
the
trap
door
constructed
in
the
floor
of
his
workshop
one
winter
night
the
old
servant
scholastique
served
the
supper
which
according
to
old
custom
she
and
the
young
mechanic
shared
with
their
master
master
zacharius
did
not
eat
though
the
food
carefully
prepared
for
him
was
offered
him
in
a
handsome
blue
and
white
dish
he
scarcely
answered
the
sweet
words
of
gerande
who
evidently
noticed
her
father
silence
and
even
the
clatter
of
scholastique
herself
no
more
struck
his
ear
than
the
roar
of
the
river
to
which
he
paid
no
attention
after
the
silent
meal
the
old
clockmaker
left
the
table
without
embracing
his
daughter
or
saying
his
usual
to
all
he
left
by
the
narrow
door
leading
to
his
den
and
the
staircase
groaned
under
his
heavy
footsteps
as
he
went
down
gerande
aubert
and
scholastique
sat
for
some
minutes
without
speaking
on
this
evening
the
weather
was
dull
the
clouds
dragged
heavily
on
the
alps
and
threatened
rain
the
severe
climate
of
switzerland
made
one
feel
sad
while
the
south
wind
swept
round
the
house
and
whistled
ominously
my
dear
young
lady
said
scholastique
at
last
do
you
know
that
our
master
has
been
out
of
sorts
for
several
days
holy
virgin
i
know
he
has
had
no
appetite
because
his
words
stick
in
his
inside
and
it
would
take
a
very
clever
devil
to
drag
even
one
out
of
him
my
father
has
some
secret
cause
of
trouble
that
i
can
not
even
guess
replied
gerande
as
a
sad
anxiety
spread
over
her
face
mademoiselle
do
let
such
sadness
fill
your
heart
you
know
the
strange
habits
of
master
zacharius
who
can
read
his
secret
thoughts
in
his
face
no
doubt
some
fatigue
has
overcome
him
but
he
will
have
forgotten
it
and
be
very
sorry
to
have
given
his
daughter
pain
it
was
aubert
who
spoke
thus
looking
into
gerande
lovely
eyes
aubert
was
the
first
apprentice
whom
master
zacharius
had
ever
admitted
to
the
intimacy
of
his
labours
for
he
appreciated
his
intelligence
discretion
and
goodness
of
heart
and
this
young
man
had
attached
himself
to
gerande
with
the
earnest
devotion
natural
to
a
noble
nature
gerande
was
eighteen
years
of
age
her
oval
face
recalled
that
of
the
artless
madonnas
whom
veneration
still
displays
at
the
street
corners
of
the
antique
towns
of
brittany
her
eyes
betrayed
an
infinite
simplicity
one
would
love
her
as
the
sweetest
realization
of
a
poet
dream
her
apparel
was
of
modest
colours
and
the
white
linen
which
was
folded
about
her
shoulders
had
the
tint
and
perfume
peculiar
to
the
linen
of
the
church
she
led
a
mystical
existence
in
geneva
which
had
not
as
yet
been
delivered
over
to
the
dryness
of
calvinism
while
night
and
morning
she
read
her
latin
prayers
in
her
missal
gerande
had
also
discovered
a
hidden
sentiment
in
aubert
thun
heart
and
comprehended
what
a
profound
devotion
the
young
workman
had
for
her
indeed
the
whole
world
in
his
eyes
was
condensed
into
this
old
clockmaker
house
and
he
passed
all
his
time
near
the
young
girl
when
he
left
her
father
workshop
after
his
work
was
over
old
scholastique
saw
all
this
but
said
nothing
her
loquacity
exhausted
itself
in
preference
on
the
evils
of
the
times
and
the
little
worries
of
the
household
nobody
tried
to
stop
its
course
it
was
with
her
as
with
the
musical
which
they
made
at
geneva
once
wound
up
you
must
break
them
before
you
will
prevent
their
playing
all
their
airs
through
finding
gerande
absorbed
in
a
melancholy
silence
scholastique
left
her
old
wooden
chair
fixed
a
taper
on
the
end
of
a
candlestick
lit
it
and
placed
it
near
a
small
waxen
virgin
sheltered
in
her
niche
of
stone
it
was
the
family
custom
to
kneel
before
this
protecting
madonna
of
the
domestic
hearth
and
to
beg
her
kindly
watchfulness
during
the
coming
night
but
on
this
evening
gerande
remained
silent
in
her
seat
well
well
dear
demoiselle
said
the
astonished
scholastique
supper
is
over
and
it
is
time
to
go
to
bed
why
do
you
tire
your
eyes
by
sitting
up
late
ah
holy
virgin
it
much
better
to
sleep
and
to
get
a
little
comfort
from
happy
dreams
in
these
detestable
times
in
which
we
live
who
can
promise
herself
a
fortunate
day
ought
we
not
to
send
for
a
doctor
for
my
father
asked
gerande
a
doctor
cried
the
old
domestic
has
master
zacharius
ever
listened
to
their
fancies
and
pompous
sayings
he
might
accept
medicines
for
the
watches
but
not
for
the
body
what
shall
we
do
murmured
gerande
has
he
gone
to
work
or
to
rest
gerande
answered
aubert
softly
some
mental
trouble
annoys
your
father
that
is
all
do
you
know
what
it
is
aubert
perhaps
gerande
tell
us
then
cried
scholastique
eagerly
economically
extinguishing
her
taper
for
several
days
gerande
said
the
young
apprentice
something
absolutely
incomprehensible
has
been
going
on
all
the
watches
which
your
father
has
made
and
sold
for
some
years
have
suddenly
stopped
very
many
of
them
have
been
brought
back
to
him
he
has
carefully
taken
them
to
pieces
the
springs
were
in
good
condition
and
the
wheels
well
set
he
has
put
them
together
yet
more
carefully
but
despite
his
skill
they
will
not
go
the
devil
in
it
cried
scholastique
why
say
you
so
asked
gerande
it
seems
very
natural
to
me
nothing
lasts
for
ever
in
this
world
the
infinite
can
not
be
fashioned
by
the
hands
of
men
it
is
none
the
less
true
returned
aubert
that
there
is
in
this
something
very
mysterious
and
extraordinary
i
have
myself
been
helping
master
zacharius
to
search
for
the
cause
of
this
derangement
of
his
watches
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
it
and
more
than
once
i
have
let
my
tools
fall
from
my
hands
in
despair
but
why
undertake
so
vain
a
task
resumed
scholastique
is
it
natural
that
a
little
copper
instrument
should
go
of
itself
and
mark
the
hours
we
ought
to
have
kept
to
the
you
will
not
talk
thus
scholastique
said
aubert
when
you
learn
that
the
was
invented
by
cain
good
heavens
what
are
you
telling
me
do
you
think
asked
gerande
simply
that
we
might
pray
to
god
to
give
life
to
my
father
watches
without
doubt
replied
aubert
good
they
will
be
useless
prayers
muttered
the
old
servant
but
heaven
will
pardon
them
for
their
good
intent
the
taper
was
relighted
scholastique
gerande
and
aubert
knelt
down
together
upon
the
tiles
of
the
room
the
young
girl
prayed
for
her
mother
soul
for
a
blessing
for
the
night
for
travellers
and
prisoners
for
the
good
and
the
wicked
and
more
earnestly
than
all
for
the
unknown
misfortunes
of
her
father
illustration
the
young
girl
prayed
then
the
three
devout
souls
rose
with
some
confidence
in
their
hearts
because
they
had
laid
their
sorrow
on
the
bosom
of
god
aubert
repaired
to
his
own
room
gerande
sat
pensively
by
the
window
whilst
the
last
lights
were
disappearing
from
the
city
streets
and
scholastique
having
poured
a
little
water
on
the
flickering
embers
and
shut
the
two
enormous
bolts
on
the
door
threw
herself
upon
her
bed
where
she
was
soon
dreaming
that
she
was
dying
of
fright
meanwhile
the
terrors
of
this
winter
night
had
increased
sometimes
with
the
whirlpools
of
the
river
the
wind
engulfed
itself
among
the
piles
and
the
whole
house
shivered
and
shook
but
the
young
girl
absorbed
in
her
sadness
thought
only
of
her
father
after
hearing
what
aubert
told
her
the
malady
of
master
zacharius
took
fantastic
proportions
in
her
mind
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
his
existence
so
dear
to
her
having
become
purely
mechanical
no
longer
moved
on
its
pivots
without
effort
suddenly
the
shutter
shaken
by
the
squall
struck
against
the
window
of
the
room
gerande
shuddered
and
started
up
without
understanding
the
cause
of
the
noise
which
thus
disturbed
her
reverie
when
she
became
a
little
calmer
she
opened
the
sash
the
clouds
had
burst
and
a
rain
pattered
on
the
surrounding
roofs
the
young
girl
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
draw
to
the
shutter
shaken
by
the
wind
but
she
feared
to
do
so
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
rain
and
the
river
confounding
their
tumultuous
waters
were
submerging
the
frail
house
the
planks
of
which
creaked
in
every
direction
she
would
have
flown
from
her
chamber
but
she
saw
below
the
flickering
of
a
light
which
appeared
to
come
from
master
zacharius
retreat
and
in
one
of
those
momentary
calms
during
which
the
elements
keep
a
sudden
silence
her
ear
caught
plaintive
sounds
she
tried
to
shut
her
window
but
could
not
the
wind
violently
repelled
her
like
a
thief
who
was
breaking
into
a
dwelling
gerande
thought
she
would
go
mad
with
terror
what
was
her
father
doing
she
opened
the
door
and
it
escaped
from
her
hands
and
slammed
loudly
with
the
force
of
the
tempest
gerande
then
found
herself
in
the
dark
succeeded
in
gaining
on
tiptoe
the
staircase
which
led
to
her
father
shop
and
pale
and
fainting
glided
down
the
old
watchmaker
was
upright
in
the
middle
of
the
room
which
resounded
with
the
roaring
of
the
river
his
bristling
hair
gave
him
a
sinister
aspect
he
was
talking
and
gesticulating
without
seeing
or
hearing
anything
gerande
stood
still
on
the
threshold
it
is
death
said
master
zacharius
in
a
hollow
voice
it
is
death
why
should
i
live
longer
now
that
i
have
dispersed
my
existence
over
the
earth
for
i
master
zacharius
am
really
the
creator
of
all
the
watches
that
i
have
fashioned
it
is
a
part
of
my
very
soul
that
i
have
shut
up
in
each
of
these
cases
of
iron
silver
or
gold
every
time
that
one
of
these
accursed
watches
stops
i
feel
my
heart
cease
beating
for
i
have
regulated
them
with
its
pulsations
as
he
spoke
in
this
strange
way
the
old
man
cast
his
eyes
on
his
bench
there
lay
all
the
pieces
of
a
watch
that
he
had
carefully
taken
apart
he
took
up
a
sort
of
hollow
cylinder
called
a
barrel
in
which
the
spring
is
enclosed
and
removed
the
steel
spiral
but
instead
of
relaxing
itself
according
to
the
laws
of
its
elasticity
it
remained
coiled
on
itself
like
a
sleeping
viper
it
seemed
knotted
like
impotent
old
men
whose
blood
has
long
been
congealed
master
zacharius
vainly
essayed
to
uncoil
it
with
his
thin
fingers
the
outlines
of
which
were
exaggerated
on
the
wall
but
he
tried
in
vain
and
soon
with
a
terrible
cry
of
anguish
and
rage
he
threw
it
through
the
into
the
boiling
rhone
gerande
her
feet
riveted
to
the
floor
stood
breathless
and
motionless
she
wished
to
approach
her
father
but
could
not
giddy
hallucinations
took
possession
of
her
suddenly
she
heard
in
the
shade
a
voice
murmur
in
her
ears
gerande
dear
gerande
grief
still
keeps
you
awake
go
in
again
i
beg
of
you
the
night
is
cold
aubert
whispered
the
young
girl
you
ought
i
not
to
be
troubled
by
what
troubles
you
these
soft
words
sent
the
blood
back
into
the
young
girl
heart
she
leaned
on
aubert
arm
and
said
to
him
my
father
is
very
ill
aubert
you
alone
can
cure
him
for
this
disorder
of
the
mind
would
not
yield
to
his
daughter
consolings
his
mind
is
attacked
by
a
very
natural
delusion
and
in
working
with
him
repairing
the
watches
you
will
bring
him
back
to
reason
aubert
she
continued
it
is
not
true
is
it
that
his
life
is
mixed
up
with
that
of
his
watches
aubert
did
not
reply
but
is
my
father
a
trade
condemned
by
god
asked
gerande
trembling
i
know
not
returned
the
apprentice
warming
the
cold
hands
of
the
girl
with
his
own
but
go
back
to
your
room
my
poor
gerande
and
with
sleep
recover
hope
gerande
slowly
returned
to
her
chamber
and
remained
there
till
daylight
without
sleep
closing
her
eyelids
meanwhile
master
zacharius
always
mute
and
motionless
gazed
at
the
river
as
it
rolled
turbulently
at
his
feet
chapter
ii
the
pride
of
science
the
severity
of
the
geneva
merchant
in
business
matters
has
become
proverbial
he
is
rigidly
honourable
and
excessively
just
what
must
then
have
been
the
shame
of
master
zacharius
when
he
saw
these
watches
which
he
had
so
carefully
constructed
returning
to
him
from
every
direction
it
was
certain
that
these
watches
had
suddenly
stopped
and
without
any
apparent
reason
the
wheels
were
in
a
good
condition
and
firmly
fixed
but
the
springs
had
lost
all
elasticity
vainly
did
the
watchmaker
try
to
replace
them
the
wheels
remained
motionless
these
unaccountable
derangements
were
greatly
to
the
old
man
discredit
his
noble
inventions
had
many
times
brought
upon
him
suspicions
of
sorcery
which
now
seemed
confirmed
these
rumours
reached
gerande
and
she
often
trembled
for
her
father
when
she
saw
malicious
glances
directed
towards
him
yet
on
the
morning
after
this
night
of
anguish
master
zacharius
seemed
to
resume
work
with
some
confidence
the
morning
sun
inspired
him
with
some
courage
aubert
hastened
to
join
him
in
the
shop
and
received
an
affable
i
am
better
said
the
old
man
i
do
know
what
strange
pains
in
the
head
attacked
me
yesterday
but
the
sun
has
quite
chased
them
away
with
the
clouds
of
the
night
in
faith
master
returned
aubert
i
do
like
the
night
for
either
of
us
and
thou
art
right
aubert
if
you
ever
become
a
great
man
you
will
understand
that
day
is
as
necessary
to
you
as
food
a
great
savant
should
be
always
ready
to
receive
the
homage
of
his
master
it
seems
to
me
that
the
pride
of
science
has
possessed
you
pride
aubert
destroy
my
past
annihilate
my
present
dissipate
my
future
and
then
it
will
be
permitted
to
me
to
live
in
obscurity
poor
boy
who
comprehends
not
the
sublime
things
to
which
my
art
is
wholly
devoted
art
thou
not
but
a
tool
in
my
hands
yet
master
zacharius
resumed
aubert
i
have
more
than
once
merited
your
praise
for
the
manner
in
which
i
adjusted
the
most
delicate
parts
of
your
watches
and
clocks
no
doubt
aubert
thou
art
a
good
workman
such
as
i
love
but
when
thou
workest
thou
thinkest
thou
hast
in
thy
hands
but
copper
silver
gold
thou
dost
not
perceive
these
metals
which
my
genius
animates
palpitating
like
living
flesh
so
that
thou
wilt
not
die
with
the
death
of
thy
works
master
zacharius
remained
silent
after
these
words
but
aubert
essayed
to
keep
up
the
conversation
indeed
master
said
he
i
love
to
see
you
work
so
unceasingly
you
will
be
ready
for
the
festival
of
our
corporation
for
i
see
that
the
work
on
this
crystal
watch
is
going
forward
famously
no
doubt
aubert
cried
the
old
watchmaker
and
it
will
be
no
slight
honour
for
me
to
have
been
able
to
cut
and
shape
the
crystal
to
the
durability
of
a
diamond
ah
louis
berghem
did
well
to
perfect
the
art
of
which
has
enabled
me
to
polish
and
pierce
the
hardest
stones
master
zacharius
was
holding
several
small
watch
pieces
of
cut
crystal
and
of
exquisite
workmanship
the
wheels
pivots
and
case
of
the
watch
were
of
the
same
material
and
he
had
employed
remarkable
skill
in
this
very
difficult
task
would
it
not
be
fine
said
he
his
face
flushing
to
see
this
watch
palpitating
beneath
its
transparent
envelope
and
to
be
able
to
count
the
beatings
of
its
heart
i
will
wager
sir
replied
the
young
apprentice
that
it
will
not
vary
a
second
in
a
year
and
you
would
wager
on
a
certainty
have
i
not
imparted
to
it
all
that
is
purest
of
myself
and
does
my
heart
vary
my
heart
i
say
aubert
did
not
dare
to
lift
his
eyes
to
his
master
face
tell
me
frankly
said
the
old
man
sadly
have
you
never
taken
me
for
a
madman
do
you
not
think
me
sometimes
subject
to
dangerous
folly
yes
is
it
not
so
in
my
daughter
eyes
and
yours
i
have
often
read
my
condemnation
oh
he
cried
as
if
in
pain
to
be
misunderstood
by
those
whom
one
most
loves
in
the
world
but
i
will
prove
victoriously
to
thee
aubert
that
i
am
right
do
not
shake
thy
head
for
thou
wilt
be
astounded
the
day
on
which
thou
understandest
how
to
listen
to
and
comprehend
me
thou
wilt
see
that
i
have
discovered
the
secrets
of
existence
the
secrets
of
the
mysterious
union
of
the
soul
with
the
body
illustration
thou
wilt
see
that
i
have
discovered
the
secrets
of
existence
as
he
spoke
thus
master
zacharius
appeared
superb
in
his
vanity
his
eyes
glittered
with
a
supernatural
fire
and
his
pride
illumined
every
feature
and
truly
if
ever
vanity
was
excusable
it
was
that
of
master
zacharius
the
watchmaking
art
indeed
down
to
his
time
had
remained
almost
in
its
infancy
from
the
day
when
plato
four
centuries
before
the
christian
era
invented
the
night
watch
a
sort
of
clepsydra
which
indicated
the
hours
of
the
night
by
the
sound
and
playing
of
a
flute
the
science
had
continued
nearly
stationary
the
masters
paid
more
attention
to
the
arts
than
to
mechanics
and
it
was
the
period
of
beautiful
watches
of
iron
copper
wood
silver
which
were
richly
engraved
like
one
of
cellini
ewers
they
made
a
masterpiece
of
chasing
which
measured
time
imperfectly
but
was
still
a
masterpiece
when
the
imagination
was
not
directed
to
the
perfection
of
modelling
it
set
to
work
to
create
clocks
with
moving
figures
and
melodious
sounds
whose
appearance
took
all
attention
besides
who
troubled
himself
in
those
days
with
regulating
the
advance
of
time
the
delays
of
the
law
were
not
as
yet
invented
the
physical
and
astronomical
sciences
had
not
as
yet
established
their
calculations
on
scrupulously
exact
measurements
there
were
neither
establishments
which
were
shut
at
a
given
hour
nor
trains
which
departed
at
a
precise
moment
in
the
evening
the
curfew
bell
sounded
and
at
night
the
hours
were
cried
amid
the
universal
silence
certainly
people
did
not
live
so
long
if
existence
is
measured
by
the
amount
of
business
done
but
they
lived
better
the
mind
was
enriched
with
the
noble
sentiments
born
of
the
contemplation
of
they
built
a
church
in
two
centuries
a
painter
painted
but
few
pictures
in
the
course
of
his
life
a
poet
only
composed
one
great
work
but
these
were
so
many
masterpieces
for
to
appreciate
when
the
exact
sciences
began
at
last
to
make
some
progress
watch
and
clock
making
followed
in
their
path
though
it
was
always
arrested
by
an
insurmountable
difficulty
the
regular
and
continuous
measurement
of
time
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
stagnation
that
master
zacharius
invented
the
escapement
which
enabled
him
to
obtain
a
mathematical
regularity
by
submitting
the
movement
of
the
pendulum
to
a
sustained
force
this
invention
had
turned
the
old
man
head
pride
swelling
in
his
heart
like
mercury
in
the
thermometer
had
attained
the
height
of
transcendent
folly
by
analogy
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
to
materialistic
conclusions
and
as
he
constructed
his
watches
he
fancied
that
he
had
discovered
the
secrets
of
the
union
of
the
soul
with
the
body
thus
on
this
day
perceiving
that
aubert
listened
to
him
attentively
he
said
to
him
in
a
tone
of
simple
conviction
dost
thou
know
what
life
is
my
child
hast
thou
comprehended
the
action
of
those
springs
which
produce
existence
hast
thou
examined
thyself
no
and
yet
with
the
eyes
of
science
thou
mightest
have
seen
the
intimate
relation
which
exists
between
god
work
and
my
own
for
it
is
from
his
creature
that
i
have
copied
the
combinations
of
the
wheels
of
my
clocks
master
replied
aubert
eagerly
can
you
compare
a
copper
or
steel
machine
with
that
breath
of
god
which
is
called
the
soul
which
animates
our
bodies
as
the
breeze
stirs
the
flowers
what
mechanism
could
be
so
adjusted
as
to
inspire
us
with
thought
that
is
not
the
question
responded
master
zacharius
gently
but
with
all
the
obstinacy
of
a
blind
man
walking
towards
an
abyss
in
order
to
understand
me
thou
must
recall
the
purpose
of
the
escapement
which
i
have
invented
when
i
saw
the
irregular
working
of
clocks
i
understood
that
the
movements
shut
up
in
them
did
not
suffice
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
submit
them
to
the
regularity
of
some
independent
force
i
then
thought
that
the
might
accomplish
this
and
i
succeeded
in
regulating
the
movement
now
was
it
not
a
sublime
idea
that
came
to
me
to
return
to
it
its
lost
force
by
the
action
of
the
clock
itself
which
it
was
charged
with
regulating
aubert
made
a
sign
of
assent
now
aubert
continued
the
old
man
growing
animated
cast
thine
eyes
upon
thyself
dost
thou
not
understand
that
there
are
two
distinct
forces
in
us
that
of
the
soul
and
that
of
the
body
that
is
a
movement
and
a
regulator
the
soul
is
the
principle
of
life
that
is
then
the
movement
whether
it
is
produced
by
a
weight
by
a
spring
or
by
an
immaterial
influence
it
is
none
the
less
in
the
heart
but
without
the
body
this
movement
would
be
unequal
irregular
impossible
thus
the
body
regulates
the
soul
and
like
the
it
is
submitted
to
regular
oscillations
and
this
is
so
true
that
one
falls
ill
when
one
drink
food
sleep
in
a
word
the
functions
of
the
body
are
not
properly
regulated
just
as
in
my
watches
the
soul
renders
to
the
body
the
force
lost
by
its
oscillations
well
what
produces
this
intimate
union
between
soul
and
body
if
not
a
marvellous
escapement
by
which
the
wheels
of
the
one
work
into
the
wheels
of
the
other
this
is
what
i
have
discovered
and
applied
and
there
are
no
longer
any
secrets
for
me
in
this
life
which
is
after
all
only
an
ingenious
mechanism
master
zacharius
looked
sublime
in
this
hallucination
which
carried
him
to
the
ultimate
mysteries
of
the
infinite
but
his
daughter
gerande
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
had
heard
all
she
rushed
into
her
father
arms
and
he
pressed
her
convulsively
to
his
breast
what
is
the
matter
with
thee
my
daughter
he
asked
if
i
had
only
a
spring
here
said
she
putting
her
hand
on
her
heart
i
would
not
love
you
as
i
do
father
master
zacharius
looked
intently
at
gerande
and
did
not
reply
suddenly
he
uttered
a
cry
carried
his
hand
eagerly
to
his
heart
and
fell
fainting
on
his
old
leathern
chair
father
what
is
the
matter
illustration
father
what
is
the
matter
help
cried
aubert
scholastique
but
scholastique
did
not
come
at
once
some
one
was
knocking
at
the
front
door
she
had
gone
to
open
it
and
when
she
returned
to
the
shop
before
she
could
open
her
mouth
the
old
watchmaker
having
recovered
his
senses
spoke
i
divine
my
old
scholastique
that
you
bring
me
still
another
of
those
accursed
watches
which
have
stopped
lord
it
is
true
enough
replied
scholastique
handing
a
watch
to
aubert
my
heart
could
not
be
mistaken
said
the
old
man
with
a
sigh
meanwhile
aubert
carefully
wound
up
the
watch
but
it
would
not
go
chapter
iii
a
strange
visit
poor
gerande
would
have
lost
her
life
with
that
of
her
father
had
it
not
been
for
the
thought
of
aubert
who
still
attached
her
to
the
world
the
old
watchmaker
was
little
by
little
passing
away
his
faculties
evidently
grew
more
feeble
as
he
concentrated
them
on
a
single
thought
by
a
sad
association
of
ideas
he
referred
everything
to
his
monomania
and
a
human
existence
seemed
to
have
departed
from
him
to
give
place
to
the
existence
of
the
intermediate
powers
moreover
certain
malicious
rivals
revived
the
sinister
rumours
which
had
spread
concerning
his
labours
the
news
of
the
strange
derangements
which
his
watches
betrayed
had
a
prodigious
effect
upon
the
master
clockmakers
of
geneva
what
signified
this
sudden
paralysis
of
their
wheels
and
why
these
strange
relations
which
they
seemed
to
have
with
the
old
man
life
these
were
the
kind
of
mysteries
which
people
never
contemplate
without
a
secret
terror
in
the
various
classes
of
the
town
from
the
apprentice
to
the
great
lord
who
used
the
watches
of
the
old
horologist
there
was
no
one
who
could
not
himself
judge
of
the
singularity
of
the
fact
the
citizens
wished
but
in
vain
to
get
to
see
master
zacharius
he
fell
very
ill
and
this
enabled
his
daughter
to
withdraw
him
from
those
incessant
visits
which
had
degenerated
into
reproaches
and
recriminations
medicines
and
physicians
were
powerless
in
presence
of
this
organic
wasting
away
the
cause
of
which
could
not
be
discovered
it
sometimes
seemed
as
if
the
old
man
heart
had
ceased
to
beat
then
the
pulsations
were
resumed
with
an
alarming
irregularity
a
custom
existed
in
those
days
of
publicly
exhibiting
the
works
of
the
masters
the
heads
of
the
various
corporations
sought
to
distinguish
themselves
by
the
novelty
or
the
perfection
of
their
productions
and
it
was
among
these
that
the
condition
of
master
zacharius
excited
the
most
lively
because
most
interested
commiseration
his
rivals
pitied
him
the
more
willingly
because
they
feared
him
the
less
they
never
forgot
the
old
success
when
he
exhibited
his
magnificent
clocks
with
moving
figures
his
repeaters
which
provoked
general
admiration
and
commanded
such
high
prices
in
the
cities
of
france
switzerland
and
germany
meanwhile
thanks
to
the
constant
and
tender
care
of
gerande
and
aubert
his
strength
seemed
to
return
a
little
and
in
the
tranquillity
in
which
his
convalescence
left
him
he
succeeded
in
detaching
himself
from
the
thoughts
which
had
absorbed
him
as
soon
as
he
could
walk
his
daughter
lured
him
away
from
the
house
which
was
still
besieged
with
dissatisfied
customers
aubert
remained
in
the
shop
vainly
adjusting
and
readjusting
the
rebel
watches
and
the
poor
boy
completely
mystified
sometimes
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
fearful
that
he
like
his
master
might
go
mad
gerande
led
her
father
towards
the
more
pleasant
promenades
of
the
town
with
his
arm
resting
on
hers
she
conducted
him
sometimes
through
the
quarter
of
saint
antoine
the
view
from
which
extends
towards
the
cologny
hill
and
over
the
lake
on
fine
mornings
they
caught
sight
of
the
gigantic
peaks
of
mount
buet
against
the
horizon
gerande
pointed
out
these
spots
to
her
father
who
had
forgotten
even
their
names
his
memory
wandered
and
he
took
a
childish
interest
in
learning
anew
what
had
passed
from
his
mind
master
zacharius
leaned
upon
his
daughter
and
the
two
heads
one
white
as
snow
and
the
other
covered
with
rich
golden
tresses
met
in
the
same
ray
of
sunlight
so
it
came
about
that
the
old
watchmaker
at
last
perceived
that
he
was
not
alone
in
the
world
as
he
looked
upon
his
young
and
lovely
daughter
and
on
himself
old
and
broken
he
reflected
that
after
his
death
she
would
be
left
alone
without
support
many
of
the
young
mechanics
of
geneva
had
already
sought
to
win
love
but
none
of
them
had
succeeded
in
gaining
access
to
the
impenetrable
retreat
of
the
watchmaker
household
it
was
natural
then
that
during
this
lucid
interval
the
old
choice
should
fall
on
aubert
thun
once
struck
with
this
thought
he
remarked
to
himself
that
this
young
couple
had
been
brought
up
with
the
same
ideas
and
the
same
beliefs
and
the
oscillations
of
their
hearts
seemed
to
him
as
he
said
one
day
to
scholastique
isochronous
the
old
servant
literally
delighted
with
the
word
though
she
did
not
understand
it
swore
by
her
holy
patron
saint
that
the
whole
town
should
hear
it
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
master
zacharius
found
it
difficult
to
calm
her
but
made
her
promise
to
keep
on
this
subject
a
silence
which
she
never
was
known
to
observe
so
though
gerande
and
aubert
were
ignorant
of
it
all
geneva
was
soon
talking
of
their
speedy
union
but
it
happened
also
that
while
the
worthy
folk
were
gossiping
a
strange
chuckle
was
often
heard
and
a
voice
saying
gerande
will
not
wed
aubert
if
the
talkers
turned
round
they
found
themselves
facing
a
little
old
man
who
was
quite
a
stranger
to
them
how
old
was
this
singular
being
no
one
could
have
told
people
conjectured
that
he
must
have
existed
for
several
centuries
and
that
was
all
his
big
flat
head
rested
upon
shoulders
the
width
of
which
was
equal
to
the
height
of
his
body
this
was
not
above
three
feet
this
personage
would
have
made
a
good
figure
to
support
a
pendulum
for
the
dial
would
have
naturally
been
placed
on
his
face
and
the
would
have
oscillated
at
its
ease
in
his
chest
his
nose
might
readily
have
been
taken
for
the
style
of
a
for
it
was
narrow
and
sharp
his
teeth
far
apart
resembled
the
cogs
of
a
wheel
and
ground
themselves
between
his
lips
his
voice
had
the
metallic
sound
of
a
bell
and
you
could
hear
his
heart
beat
like
the
tick
of
a
clock
this
little
man
whose
arms
moved
like
the
hands
on
a
dial
walked
with
jerks
without
ever
turning
round
if
any
one
followed
him
it
was
found
that
he
walked
a
league
an
hour
and
that
his
course
was
nearly
circular
this
strange
being
had
not
long
been
seen
wandering
or
rather
circulating
around
the
town
but
it
had
already
been
observed
that
every
day
at
the
moment
when
the
sun
passed
the
meridian
he
stopped
before
the
cathedral
of
saint
pierre
and
resumed
his
course
after
the
twelve
strokes
of
noon
had
sounded
excepting
at
this
precise
moment
he
seemed
to
become
a
part
of
all
the
conversations
in
which
the
old
watchmaker
was
talked
of
and
people
asked
each
other
in
terror
what
relation
could
exist
between
him
and
master
zacharius
it
was
remarked
too
that
he
never
lost
sight
of
the
old
man
and
his
daughter
while
they
were
taking
their
promenades
one
day
gerande
perceived
this
monster
looking
at
her
with
a
hideous
smile
she
clung
to
her
father
with
a
frightened
motion
what
is
the
matter
my
gerande
asked
master
zacharius
i
do
not
know
replied
the
young
girl
but
thou
art
changed
my
child
art
thou
going
to
fall
ill
in
thy
turn
ah
well
he
added
with
a
sad
smile
then
i
must
take
care
of
thee
and
i
will
do
it
tenderly
o
father
it
will
be
nothing
i
am
cold
and
i
imagine
that
it
is
what
gerande
the
presence
of
that
man
who
always
follows
us
she
replied
in
a
low
tone
master
zacharius
turned
towards
the
little
old
man
faith
he
goes
well
said
he
with
a
satisfied
air
for
it
is
just
four
fear
nothing
my
child
it
is
not
a
man
it
is
a
clock
gerande
looked
at
her
father
in
terror
how
could
master
zacharius
read
the
hour
on
this
strange
creature
visage
continued
the
old
watchmaker
paying
no
further
attention
to
the
matter
i
have
not
seen
aubert
for
several
days
he
has
not
left
us
however
father
said
gerande
whose
thoughts
turned
into
a
gentler
channel
what
is
he
doing
then
he
is
working
ah
cried
the
old
man
he
is
at
work
repairing
my
watches
is
he
not
but
he
will
never
succeed
for
it
is
not
repair
they
need
but
a
resurrection
gerande
remained
silent
i
must
know
added
the
old
man
if
they
have
brought
back
any
more
of
those
accursed
watches
upon
which
the
devil
has
sent
this
epidemic
after
these
words
master
zacharius
fell
into
complete
silence
till
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
his
house
and
for
the
first
time
since
his
convalescence
descended
to
his
shop
while
gerande
sadly
repaired
to
her
chamber
just
as
master
zacharius
crossed
the
threshold
of
his
shop
one
of
the
many
clocks
suspended
on
the
wall
struck
five
usually
the
bells
of
these
clocks
admirably
regulated
as
they
were
struck
simultaneously
and
this
rejoiced
the
old
heart
but
on
this
day
the
bells
struck
one
after
another
so
that
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
ear
was
deafened
by
the
successive
noises
master
zacharius
suffered
acutely
he
could
not
remain
still
but
went
from
one
clock
to
the
other
and
beat
the
time
to
them
like
a
conductor
who
no
longer
has
control
over
his
musicians
when
the
last
had
ceased
striking
the
door
of
the
shop
opened
and
master
zacharius
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
to
see
before
him
the
little
old
man
who
looked
fixedly
at
him
and
said
master
may
i
not
speak
with
you
a
few
moments
who
are
you
asked
the
watchmaker
abruptly
a
colleague
it
is
my
business
to
regulate
the
sun
ah
you
regulate
the
sun
replied
master
zacharius
eagerly
without
wincing
i
can
scarcely
compliment
you
upon
it
your
sun
goes
badly
and
in
order
to
make
ourselves
agree
with
it
we
have
to
keep
putting
our
clocks
forward
so
much
or
back
so
much
and
by
the
cloven
foot
cried
this
weird
personage
you
are
right
my
master
my
sun
does
not
always
mark
noon
at
the
same
moment
as
your
clocks
but
some
day
it
will
be
known
that
this
is
because
of
the
inequality
of
the
earth
transfer
and
a
mean
noon
will
be
invented
which
will
regulate
this
irregularity
shall
i
live
till
then
asked
the
old
man
with
glistening
eyes
without
doubt
replied
the
little
old
man
laughing
can
you
believe
that
you
will
ever
die
alas
i
am
very
ill
now
ah
let
us
talk
of
that
by
beelzebub
that
will
lead
to
just
what
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
saying
this
the
strange
being
leaped
upon
the
old
leather
chair
and
carried
his
legs
one
under
the
other
after
the
fashion
of
the
bones
which
the
painters
of
funeral
hangings
cross
beneath
death
heads
then
he
resumed
in
an
ironical
tone
illustration
then
he
resumed
in
an
ironical
tone
let
us
see
master
zacharius
what
is
going
on
in
this
good
town
of
geneva
they
say
that
your
health
is
failing
that
your
watches
have
need
of
a
doctor
ah
do
you
believe
that
there
is
an
intimate
relation
between
their
existence
and
mine
cried
master
zacharius
why
i
imagine
that
these
watches
have
faults
even
vices
if
these
wantons
do
not
preserve
a
regular
conduct
it
is
right
that
they
should
bear
the
consequences
of
their
irregularity
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
need
of
reforming
a
little
what
do
you
call
faults
asked
master
zacharius
reddening
at
the
sarcastic
tone
in
which
these
words
were
uttered
have
they
not
a
right
to
be
proud
of
their
origin
not
too
proud
not
too
proud
replied
the
little
old
man
they
bear
a
celebrated
name
and
an
illustrious
signature
is
graven
on
their
cases
it
is
true
and
theirs
is
the
exclusive
privilege
of
being
introduced
among
the
noblest
families
but
for
some
time
they
have
got
out
of
order
and
you
can
do
nothing
in
the
matter
master
zacharius
and
the
stupidest
apprentice
in
geneva
could
prove
it
to
you
to
me
to
me
master
zacharius
cried
the
old
man
with
a
flush
of
outraged
pride
to
you
master
zacharius
you
who
can
not
restore
life
to
your
watches
but
it
is
because
i
have
a
fever
and
so
have
they
also
replied
the
old
man
as
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
upon
him
very
well
they
will
die
with
you
since
you
can
not
impart
a
little
elasticity
to
their
springs
die
no
for
you
yourself
have
said
it
i
can
not
die
i
the
first
watchmaker
in
the
world
i
who
by
means
of
these
pieces
and
diverse
wheels
have
been
able
to
regulate
the
movement
with
absolute
precision
have
i
not
subjected
time
to
exact
laws
and
can
i
not
dispose
of
it
like
a
despot
before
a
sublime
genius
had
arranged
these
wandering
hours
regularly
in
what
vast
uncertainty
was
human
destiny
plunged
at
what
certain
moment
could
the
acts
of
life
be
connected
with
each
other
but
you
man
or
devil
whatever
you
may
be
have
never
considered
the
magnificence
of
my
art
which
calls
every
science
to
its
aid
no
no
i
master
zacharius
can
not
die
for
as
i
have
regulated
time
time
would
end
with
me
it
would
return
to
the
infinite
whence
my
genius
has
rescued
it
and
it
would
lose
itself
irreparably
in
the
abyss
of
nothingness
no
i
can
no
more
die
than
the
creator
of
this
universe
that
submitted
to
his
laws
i
have
become
his
equal
and
i
have
partaken
of
his
power
if
god
has
created
eternity
master
zacharius
has
created
time
the
old
watchmaker
now
resembled
the
fallen
angel
defiant
in
the
presence
of
the
creator
the
little
old
man
gazed
at
him
and
even
seemed
to
breathe
into
him
this
impious
transport
well
said
master
he
replied
beelzebub
had
less
right
than
you
to
compare
himself
with
god
your
glory
must
not
perish
so
your
servant
here
desires
to
give
you
the
method
of
controlling
these
rebellious
watches
what
is
it
what
is
it
cried
master
zacharius
you
shall
know
on
the
day
after
that
on
which
you
have
given
me
your
daughter
hand
my
gerande
herself
my
daughter
heart
is
not
free
replied
master
zacharius
who
seemed
neither
astonished
nor
shocked
at
the
strange
demand
bah
she
is
not
the
least
beautiful
of
watches
but
she
will
end
by
stopping
also
my
daughter
my
gerande
no
well
return
to
your
watches
master
zacharius
adjust
and
readjust
them
get
ready
the
marriage
of
your
daughter
and
your
apprentice
temper
your
springs
with
your
best
steel
bless
aubert
and
the
pretty
gerande
but
remember
your
watches
will
never
go
and
gerande
will
not
wed
aubert
thereupon
the
little
old
man
disappeared
but
not
so
quickly
that
master
zacharius
could
not
hear
six
strike
in
his
breast
chapter
iv
the
church
of
saint
pierre
meanwhile
master
zacharius
became
more
feeble
in
mind
and
body
every
day
an
unusual
excitement
indeed
impelled
him
to
continue
his
work
more
eagerly
than
ever
nor
could
his
daughter
entice
him
from
it
his
pride
was
still
more
aroused
after
the
crisis
to
which
his
strange
visitor
had
hurried
him
so
treacherously
and
he
resolved
to
overcome
by
the
force
of
genius
the
malign
influence
which
weighed
upon
his
work
and
himself
he
first
repaired
to
the
various
clocks
of
the
town
which
were
confided
to
his
care
he
made
sure
by
a
scrupulous
examination
that
the
wheels
were
in
good
condition
the
pivots
firm
the
weights
exactly
balanced
every
part
even
to
the
bells
was
examined
with
the
minute
attention
of
a
physician
studying
the
breast
of
a
patient
nothing
indicated
that
these
clocks
were
on
the
point
of
being
affected
by
inactivity
gerande
and
aubert
often
accompanied
the
old
man
on
these
visits
he
would
no
doubt
have
been
pleased
to
see
them
eager
to
go
with
him
and
certainly
he
would
not
have
been
so
much
absorbed
in
his
approaching
end
had
he
thought
that
his
existence
was
to
be
prolonged
by
that
of
these
cherished
ones
and
had
he
understood
that
something
of
the
life
of
a
father
always
remains
in
his
children
the
old
watchmaker
on
returning
home
resumed
his
labours
with
feverish
zeal
though
persuaded
that
he
would
not
succeed
it
yet
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
this
could
be
so
and
he
unceasingly
took
to
pieces
the
watches
which
were
brought
to
his
shop
and
put
them
together
again
aubert
tortured
his
mind
in
vain
to
discover
the
causes
of
the
evil
master
said
he
this
can
only
come
from
the
wear
of
the
pivots
and
gearing
do
you
want
then
to
kill
me
little
by
little
replied
master
zacharius
passionately
are
these
watches
child
work
was
it
lest
i
should
hurt
my
fingers
that
i
worked
the
surface
of
these
copper
pieces
in
the
lathe
have
i
not
forged
these
pieces
of
copper
myself
so
as
to
obtain
a
greater
strength
are
not
these
springs
tempered
to
a
rare
perfection
could
anybody
have
used
finer
oils
than
mine
you
must
yourself
agree
that
it
is
impossible
and
you
avow
in
short
that
the
devil
is
in
it
from
morning
till
night
discontented
purchasers
besieged
the
house
and
they
got
access
to
the
old
watchmaker
himself
who
knew
not
which
of
them
to
listen
to
illustration
from
morning
till
night
discontented
purchasers
besieged
the
house
this
watch
loses
and
i
can
not
succeed
in
regulating
it
said
one
this
said
another
is
absolutely
obstinate
and
stands
still
as
did
joshua
sun
if
it
is
true
said
most
of
them
that
your
health
has
an
influence
on
that
of
your
watches
master
zacharius
get
well
as
soon
as
possible
the
old
man
gazed
at
these
people
with
haggard
eyes
and
only
replied
by
shaking
his
head
or
by
a
few
sad
words
wait
till
the
first
fine
weather
my
friends
the
season
is
coming
which
revives
existence
in
wearied
bodies
we
want
the
sun
to
warm
us
all
a
fine
thing
if
my
watches
are
to
be
ill
through
the
winter
said
one
of
the
most
angry
do
you
know
master
zacharius
that
your
name
is
inscribed
in
full
on
their
faces
by
the
virgin
you
do
little
honour
to
your
signature
it
happened
at
last
that
the
old
man
abashed
by
these
reproaches
took
some
pieces
of
gold
from
his
old
trunk
and
began
to
buy
back
the
damaged
watches
at
news
of
this
the
customers
came
in
a
crowd
and
the
poor
watchmaker
money
fast
melted
away
but
his
honesty
remained
intact
gerande
warmly
praised
his
delicacy
which
was
leading
him
straight
towards
ruin
and
aubert
soon
offered
his
own
savings
to
his
master
what
will
become
of
my
daughter
said
master
zacharius
clinging
now
and
then
in
the
shipwreck
to
his
paternal
love
aubert
dared
not
answer
that
he
was
full
of
hope
for
the
future
and
of
deep
devotion
to
gerande
master
zacharius
would
have
that
day
called
him
his
and
thus
refuted
the
sad
prophecy
which
still
buzzed
in
his
ears
gerande
will
not
wed
aubert
by
this
plan
the
watchmaker
at
last
succeeded
in
entirely
despoiling
himself
his
antique
vases
passed
into
the
hands
of
strangers
he
deprived
himself
of
the
panels
which
adorned
the
walls
of
his
house
some
primitive
pictures
of
the
early
flemish
painters
soon
ceased
to
please
his
daughter
eyes
and
everything
even
the
precious
tools
that
his
genius
had
invented
were
sold
to
indemnify
the
clamorous
customers
scholastique
alone
refused
to
listen
to
reason
on
the
subject
but
her
efforts
failed
to
prevent
the
unwelcome
visitors
from
reaching
her
master
and
from
soon
departing
with
some
valuable
object
then
her
chattering
was
heard
in
all
the
streets
of
the
neighbourhood
where
she
had
long
been
known
she
eagerly
denied
the
rumours
of
sorcery
and
magic
on
the
part
of
master
zacharius
which
gained
currency
but
as
at
bottom
she
was
persuaded
of
their
truth
she
said
her
prayers
over
and
over
again
to
redeem
her
pious
falsehoods
it
had
been
noticed
that
for
some
time
the
old
watchmaker
had
neglected
his
religious
duties
time
was
when
he
had
accompanied
gerande
to
church
and
had
seemed
to
find
in
prayer
the
intellectual
charm
which
it
imparts
to
thoughtful
minds
since
it
is
the
most
sublime
exercise
of
the
imagination
this
voluntary
neglect
of
holy
practices
added
to
the
secret
habits
of
his
life
had
in
some
sort
confirmed
the
accusations
levelled
against
his
labours
so
with
the
double
purpose
of
drawing
her
father
back
to
god
and
to
the
world
gerande
resolved
to
call
religion
to
her
aid
she
thought
that
it
might
give
some
vitality
to
his
dying
soul
but
the
dogmas
of
faith
and
humility
had
to
combat
in
the
soul
of
master
zacharius
an
insurmountable
pride
and
came
into
collision
with
that
vanity
of
science
which
connects
everything
with
itself
without
rising
to
the
infinite
source
whence
first
principles
flow
it
was
under
these
circumstances
that
the
young
girl
undertook
her
father
conversion
and
her
influence
was
so
effective
that
the
old
watchmaker
promised
to
attend
high
mass
at
the
cathedral
on
the
following
sunday
gerande
was
in
an
ecstasy
as
if
heaven
had
opened
to
her
view
old
scholastique
could
not
contain
her
joy
and
at
last
found
irrefutable
arguments
against
the
gossiping
tongues
which
accused
her
master
of
impiety
she
spoke
of
it
to
her
neighbours
her
friends
her
enemies
to
those
whom
she
knew
not
as
well
as
to
those
whom
she
knew
in
faith
we
scarcely
believe
what
you
tell
us
dame
scholastique
they
replied
master
zacharius
has
always
acted
in
concert
with
the
devil
you
have
counted
then
replied
the
old
servant
the
fine
bells
which
strike
for
my
master
clocks
how
many
times
they
have
struck
the
hours
of
prayer
and
the
mass
no
doubt
they
would
reply
but
has
he
not
invented
machines
which
go
all
by
themselves
and
which
actually
do
the
work
of
a
real
man
could
a
child
of
the
devil
exclaimed
dame
scholastique
wrathfully
have
executed
the
fine
iron
clock
of
the
château
of
andernatt
which
the
town
of
geneva
was
not
rich
enough
to
buy
a
pious
motto
appeared
at
each
hour
and
a
christian
who
obeyed
them
would
have
gone
straight
to
paradise
is
that
the
work
of
the
devil
this
masterpiece
made
twenty
years
before
had
carried
master
zacharius
fame
to
its
acme
but
even
then
there
had
been
accusations
of
sorcery
against
him
but
at
least
the
old
visit
to
the
cathedral
ought
to
reduce
malicious
tongues
to
silence
master
zacharius
having
doubtless
forgotten
the
promise
made
to
his
daughter
had
returned
to
his
shop
after
being
convinced
of
his
powerlessness
to
give
life
to
his
watches
he
resolved
to
try
if
he
could
not
make
some
new
ones
he
abandoned
all
those
useless
works
and
devoted
himself
to
the
completion
of
the
crystal
watch
which
he
intended
to
be
his
masterpiece
but
in
vain
did
he
use
his
most
perfect
tools
and
employ
rubies
and
diamonds
for
resisting
friction
the
watch
fell
from
his
hands
the
first
time
that
he
attempted
to
wind
it
up
the
old
man
concealed
this
circumstance
from
every
one
even
from
his
daughter
but
from
that
time
his
health
rapidly
declined
there
were
only
the
last
oscillations
of
a
pendulum
which
goes
slower
when
nothing
restores
its
original
force
it
seemed
as
if
the
laws
of
gravity
acting
directly
upon
him
were
dragging
him
irresistibly
down
to
the
grave
the
sunday
so
ardently
anticipated
by
gerande
at
last
arrived
the
weather
was
fine
and
the
temperature
inspiriting
the
people
of
geneva
were
passing
quietly
through
the
streets
gaily
chatting
about
the
return
of
spring
gerande
tenderly
taking
the
old
man
arm
directed
her
steps
towards
the
cathedral
while
scholastique
followed
behind
with
the
people
looked
curiously
at
them
as
they
passed
the
old
watchmaker
permitted
himself
to
be
led
like
a
child
or
rather
like
a
blind
man
the
faithful
of
saint
pierre
were
almost
frightened
when
they
saw
him
cross
the
threshold
and
shrank
back
at
his
approach
the
chants
of
high
mass
were
already
resounding
through
the
church
gerande
went
to
her
accustomed
bench
and
kneeled
with
profound
and
simple
reverence
master
zacharius
remained
standing
upright
beside
her
the
ceremonies
continued
with
the
majestic
solemnity
of
that
faithful
age
but
the
old
man
had
no
faith
he
did
not
implore
the
pity
of
heaven
with
cries
of
anguish
of
the
kyrie
he
did
not
with
the
gloria
in
excelsis
sing
the
splendours
of
the
heavenly
heights
the
reading
of
the
testament
did
not
draw
him
from
his
materialistic
reverie
and
he
forgot
to
join
in
the
homage
of
the
credo
this
proud
old
man
remained
motionless
as
insensible
and
silent
as
a
stone
statue
and
even
at
the
solemn
moment
when
the
bell
announced
the
miracle
of
transubstantiation
he
did
not
bow
his
head
but
gazed
directly
at
the
sacred
host
which
the
priest
raised
above
the
heads
of
the
faithful
gerande
looked
at
her
father
and
a
flood
of
tears
moistened
her
missal
at
this
moment
the
clock
of
saint
pierre
struck
eleven
master
zacharius
turned
quickly
towards
this
ancient
clock
which
still
spoke
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
its
face
was
gazing
steadily
at
him
the
figures
of
the
hours
shone
as
if
they
had
been
engraved
in
lines
of
fire
and
the
hands
shot
forth
electric
sparks
from
their
sharp
points
illustration
this
proud
old
man
remained
motionless
the
mass
ended
it
was
customary
for
the
angelus
to
be
said
at
noon
and
the
priests
before
leaving
the
altar
waited
for
the
clock
to
strike
the
hour
of
twelve
in
a
few
moments
this
prayer
would
ascend
to
the
feet
of
the
virgin
but
suddenly
a
harsh
noise
was
heard
master
zacharius
uttered
a
piercing
cry
the
large
hand
of
the
clock
having
reached
twelve
had
abruptly
stopped
and
the
clock
did
not
strike
the
hour
gerande
hastened
to
her
father
aid
he
had
fallen
down
motionless
and
they
carried
him
outside
the
church
it
is
the
murmured
gerande
sobbing
when
he
had
been
borne
home
master
zacharius
lay
upon
his
bed
utterly
crushed
life
seemed
only
to
still
exist
on
the
surface
of
his
body
like
the
last
whiffs
of
smoke
about
a
lamp
just
extinguished
when
he
came
to
his
senses
aubert
and
gerande
were
leaning
over
him
in
these
last
moments
the
future
took
in
his
eyes
the
shape
of
the
present
he
saw
his
daughter
alone
without
a
protector
my
son
said
he
to
aubert
i
give
my
daughter
to
thee
so
saying
he
stretched
out
his
hands
towards
his
two
children
who
were
thus
united
at
his
but
soon
master
zacharius
lifted
himself
up
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
the
words
of
the
little
old
man
recurred
to
his
mind
i
do
not
wish
to
die
he
cried
i
can
not
die
i
master
zacharius
ought
not
to
die
my
books
my
accounts
with
these
words
he
sprang
from
his
bed
towards
a
book
in
which
the
names
of
his
customers
and
the
articles
which
had
been
sold
to
them
were
inscribed
he
seized
it
and
rapidly
turned
over
its
leaves
and
his
emaciated
finger
fixed
itself
on
one
of
the
pages
there
he
cried
there
this
old
iron
clock
sold
to
pittonaccio
it
is
the
only
one
that
has
not
been
returned
to
me
it
still
exists
it
goes
it
lives
ah
i
wish
for
it
i
must
find
it
i
will
take
such
care
of
it
that
death
will
no
longer
seek
me
and
he
fainted
away
aubert
and
gerande
knelt
by
the
old
man
and
prayed
together
chapter
the
hour
of
death
several
days
passed
and
master
zacharius
though
almost
dead
rose
from
his
bed
and
returned
to
active
life
under
a
supernatural
excitement
he
lived
by
pride
but
gerande
did
not
deceive
herself
her
father
body
and
soul
were
for
ever
lost
the
old
man
got
together
his
last
remaining
resources
without
thought
of
those
who
were
dependent
upon
him
he
betrayed
an
incredible
energy
walking
ferreting
about
and
mumbling
strange
incomprehensible
words
one
morning
gerande
went
down
to
his
shop
master
zacharius
was
not
there
she
waited
for
him
all
day
master
zacharius
did
not
return
gerande
wept
bitterly
but
her
father
did
not
reappear
aubert
searched
everywhere
through
the
town
and
soon
came
to
the
sad
conviction
that
the
old
man
had
left
it
let
us
find
my
father
cried
gerande
when
the
young
apprentice
told
her
this
sad
news
where
can
he
be
aubert
asked
himself
an
inspiration
suddenly
came
to
his
mind
he
remembered
the
last
words
which
master
zacharius
had
spoken
the
old
man
only
lived
now
in
the
old
iron
clock
that
had
not
been
returned
master
zacharius
must
have
gone
in
search
of
it
aubert
spoke
of
this
to
gerande
let
us
look
at
my
father
book
she
replied
they
descended
to
the
shop
the
book
was
open
on
the
bench
all
the
watches
or
clocks
made
by
the
old
man
and
which
had
been
returned
to
him
because
they
were
out
of
order
were
stricken
out
excepting
one
sold
to
pittonaccio
an
iron
clock
with
bell
and
moving
figures
sent
to
his
château
at
andernatt
it
was
this
moral
clock
of
which
scholastique
had
spoken
with
so
much
enthusiasm
my
father
is
there
cried
gerande
let
us
hasten
thither
replied
aubert
we
may
still
save
him
not
for
this
life
murmured
gerande
but
at
least
for
the
other
by
the
mercy
of
god
gerande
the
château
of
andernatt
stands
in
the
gorge
of
the
twenty
hours
from
geneva
let
us
go
that
very
evening
aubert
and
gerande
followed
by
the
old
servant
set
out
on
foot
by
the
road
which
skirts
lake
leman
they
accomplished
five
leagues
during
the
night
stopping
neither
at
bessinge
nor
at
ermance
where
rises
the
famous
château
of
the
mayors
they
with
difficulty
forded
the
torrent
of
the
dranse
and
everywhere
they
went
they
inquired
for
master
zacharius
and
were
soon
convinced
that
they
were
on
his
track
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
having
passed
thonon
they
reached
evian
whence
the
swiss
territory
may
be
seen
extended
over
twelve
leagues
but
the
two
betrothed
did
not
even
perceive
the
enchanting
prospect
they
went
straight
forward
urged
on
by
a
supernatural
force
aubert
leaning
on
a
knotty
stick
offered
his
arm
alternately
to
gerande
and
to
scholastique
and
he
made
the
greatest
efforts
to
sustain
his
companions
all
three
talked
of
their
sorrow
of
their
hopes
and
thus
passed
along
the
beautiful
road
by
the
and
across
the
narrow
plateau
which
unites
the
borders
of
the
lake
with
the
heights
of
the
chalais
they
soon
reached
bouveret
where
the
rhone
enters
the
lake
of
geneva
on
leaving
this
town
they
diverged
from
the
lake
and
their
weariness
increased
amid
these
mountain
districts
vionnaz
chesset
collombay
half
lost
villages
were
soon
left
behind
meanwhile
their
knees
shook
their
feet
were
lacerated
by
the
sharp
points
which
covered
the
ground
like
a
brushwood
of
granite
but
no
trace
of
master
zacharius
he
must
be
found
however
and
the
two
young
people
did
not
seek
repose
either
in
the
isolated
hamlets
or
at
the
château
of
monthay
which
with
its
dependencies
formed
the
appanage
of
margaret
of
savoy
at
last
late
in
the
day
and
half
dead
with
fatigue
they
reached
the
hermitage
of
which
is
situated
at
the
base
of
the
six
hundred
feet
above
the
rhone
the
hermit
received
the
three
wanderers
as
night
was
falling
they
could
not
have
gone
another
step
and
here
they
must
needs
rest
the
hermit
could
give
them
no
news
of
master
zacharius
they
could
scarcely
hope
to
find
him
still
living
amid
these
sad
solitudes
the
night
was
dark
the
wind
howled
amid
the
mountains
and
the
avalanches
roared
down
from
the
summits
of
the
broken
crags
aubert
and
gerande
crouching
before
the
hermit
hearth
told
him
their
melancholy
tale
their
mantles
covered
with
snow
were
drying
in
a
corner
and
without
the
hermit
dog
barked
lugubriously
and
mingled
his
voice
with
that
of
the
tempest
pride
said
the
hermit
to
his
guests
has
destroyed
an
angel
created
for
good
it
is
the
against
which
the
destinies
of
man
strike
you
can
not
reason
with
pride
the
principal
of
all
the
vices
since
by
its
very
nature
the
proud
man
refuses
to
listen
to
it
it
only
remains
then
to
pray
for
your
father
all
four
knelt
down
when
the
barking
of
the
dog
redoubled
and
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
hermitage
open
in
the
devil
name
the
door
yielded
under
the
blows
and
a
dishevelled
haggard
man
appeared
my
father
cried
gerande
it
was
master
zacharius
where
am
i
said
he
in
eternity
time
is
ended
the
hours
no
longer
strike
the
hands
have
stopped
father
returned
gerande
with
so
piteous
an
emotion
that
the
old
man
seemed
to
return
to
the
world
of
the
living
thou
here
gerande
he
cried
and
thou
aubert
ah
my
dear
betrothed
ones
you
are
going
to
be
married
in
our
old
church
father
said
gerande
seizing
him
by
the
arm
come
home
to
geneva
come
with
us
the
old
man
tore
away
from
his
daughter
embrace
and
hurried
towards
the
door
on
the
threshold
of
which
the
snow
was
falling
in
large
flakes
do
not
abandon
your
children
cried
aubert
why
return
replied
the
old
man
sadly
to
those
places
which
my
life
has
already
quitted
and
where
a
part
of
myself
is
for
ever
buried
your
soul
is
not
dead
said
the
hermit
solemnly
my
soul
o
no
its
wheels
are
good
i
perceive
it
beating
regularly
your
soul
is
immaterial
your
soul
is
immortal
replied
the
hermit
sternly
yes
like
my
glory
but
it
is
shut
up
in
the
château
of
andernatt
and
i
wish
to
see
it
again
the
hermit
crossed
himself
scholastique
became
almost
inanimate
aubert
held
gerande
in
his
arms
the
château
of
andernatt
is
inhabited
by
one
who
is
lost
said
the
hermit
one
who
does
not
salute
the
cross
of
my
hermitage
my
father
go
not
thither
i
want
my
soul
my
soul
is
mine
hold
him
hold
my
father
cried
gerande
but
the
old
man
had
leaped
across
the
threshold
and
plunged
into
the
night
crying
mine
mine
my
soul
gerande
aubert
and
scholastique
hastened
after
him
they
went
by
difficult
paths
across
which
master
zacharius
sped
like
a
tempest
urged
by
an
irresistible
force
the
snow
raged
around
them
and
mingled
its
white
flakes
with
the
froth
of
the
swollen
torrents
as
they
passed
the
chapel
erected
in
memory
of
the
massacre
of
the
theban
legion
they
hurriedly
crossed
themselves
master
zacharius
was
not
to
be
seen
at
last
the
village
of
evionnaz
appeared
in
the
midst
of
this
sterile
region
the
hardest
heart
would
have
been
moved
to
see
this
hamlet
lost
among
these
horrible
solitudes
the
old
man
sped
on
and
plunged
into
the
deepest
gorge
of
the
which
pierce
the
sky
with
their
sharp
peaks
soon
a
ruin
old
and
gloomy
as
the
rocks
at
its
base
rose
before
him
it
is
there
there
he
cried
hastening
his
pace
still
more
frantically
illustration
it
is
there
there
the
château
of
andernatt
was
a
ruin
even
then
a
thick
crumbling
tower
rose
above
it
and
seemed
to
menace
with
its
downfall
the
old
gables
which
reared
themselves
below
the
vast
piles
of
jagged
stones
were
gloomy
to
look
on
several
dark
halls
appeared
amid
the
debris
with
ceilings
now
become
the
abode
of
vipers
a
low
and
narrow
postern
opening
upon
a
ditch
choked
with
rubbish
gave
access
to
the
château
who
had
dwelt
there
none
knew
no
doubt
some
margrave
half
lord
half
brigand
had
sojourned
in
it
to
the
margrave
had
succeeded
bandits
or
counterfeit
coiners
who
had
been
hanged
on
the
scene
of
their
crime
the
legend
went
that
on
winter
nights
satan
came
to
lead
his
diabolical
dances
on
the
slope
of
the
deep
gorges
in
which
the
shadow
of
these
ruins
was
engulfed
but
master
zacharius
was
not
dismayed
by
their
sinister
aspect
he
reached
the
postern
no
one
forbade
him
to
pass
a
spacious
and
gloomy
court
presented
itself
to
his
eyes
no
one
forbade
him
to
cross
it
he
passed
along
the
kind
of
inclined
plane
which
conducted
to
one
of
the
long
corridors
whose
arches
seemed
to
banish
daylight
from
beneath
their
heavy
springings
his
advance
was
unresisted
gerande
aubert
and
scholastique
closely
followed
him
master
zacharius
as
if
guided
by
an
irresistible
hand
seemed
sure
of
his
way
and
strode
along
with
rapid
step
he
reached
an
old
door
which
fell
before
his
blows
whilst
the
bats
described
oblique
circles
around
his
head
an
immense
hall
better
preserved
than
the
rest
was
soon
reached
high
sculptured
panels
on
which
serpents
ghouls
and
other
strange
figures
seemed
to
disport
themselves
confusedly
covered
its
walls
several
long
and
narrow
windows
like
loopholes
shivered
beneath
the
bursts
of
the
tempest
master
zacharius
on
reaching
the
middle
of
this
hall
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
on
an
iron
support
fastened
to
the
wall
stood
the
clock
in
which
now
resided
his
entire
life
this
unequalled
masterpiece
represented
an
ancient
roman
church
with
buttresses
of
wrought
iron
with
its
heavy
where
there
was
a
complete
chime
for
the
anthem
of
the
day
the
angelus
the
mass
vespers
compline
and
the
benediction
above
the
church
door
which
opened
at
the
hour
of
the
services
was
placed
a
rose
in
the
centre
of
which
two
hands
moved
and
the
archivault
of
which
reproduced
the
twelve
hours
of
the
face
sculptured
in
relief
between
the
door
and
the
rose
just
as
scholastique
had
said
a
maxim
relative
to
the
employment
of
every
moment
of
the
day
appeared
on
a
copper
plate
master
zacharius
had
once
regulated
this
succession
of
devices
with
a
really
christian
solicitude
the
hours
of
prayer
of
work
of
repast
of
recreation
and
of
repose
followed
each
other
according
to
the
religious
discipline
and
were
to
infallibly
insure
salvation
to
him
who
scrupulously
observed
their
commands
master
zacharius
intoxicated
with
joy
went
forward
to
take
possession
of
the
clock
when
a
frightful
roar
of
laughter
resounded
behind
him
he
turned
and
by
the
light
of
a
smoky
lamp
recognized
the
little
old
man
of
geneva
you
here
cried
he
gerande
was
afraid
she
drew
closer
to
aubert
master
zacharius
said
the
monster
who
are
you
signor
pittonaccio
at
your
service
you
have
come
to
give
me
your
daughter
you
have
remembered
my
words
will
not
wed
aubert
the
young
apprentice
rushed
upon
pittonaccio
who
escaped
from
him
like
a
shadow
stop
aubert
cried
master
zacharius
said
pittonaccio
and
he
disappeared
my
father
let
us
fly
from
this
hateful
place
cried
gerande
my
father
master
zacharius
was
no
longer
there
he
was
pursuing
the
phantom
of
pittonaccio
across
the
rickety
corridors
scholastique
gerande
and
aubert
remained
speechless
and
fainting
in
the
large
gloomy
hall
the
young
girl
had
fallen
upon
a
stone
seat
the
old
servant
knelt
beside
her
and
prayed
aubert
remained
erect
watching
his
betrothed
pale
lights
wandered
in
the
darkness
and
the
silence
was
only
broken
by
the
movements
of
the
little
animals
which
live
in
old
wood
and
the
noise
of
which
marks
the
hours
of
death
watch
when
daylight
came
they
ventured
upon
the
endless
staircase
which
wound
beneath
these
ruined
masses
for
two
hours
they
wandered
thus
without
meeting
a
living
soul
and
hearing
only
a
echo
responding
to
their
cries
sometimes
they
found
themselves
buried
a
hundred
feet
below
the
ground
and
sometimes
they
reached
places
whence
they
could
overlook
the
wild
mountains
chance
brought
them
at
last
back
again
to
the
vast
hall
which
had
sheltered
them
during
this
night
of
anguish
it
was
no
longer
empty
master
zacharius
and
pittonaccio
were
talking
there
together
the
one
upright
and
rigid
as
a
corpse
the
other
crouching
over
a
marble
table
master
zacharius
when
he
perceived
gerande
went
forward
and
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
towards
pittonaccio
saying
behold
your
lord
and
master
my
daughter
gerande
behold
your
husband
gerande
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
never
cried
aubert
for
she
is
my
betrothed
never
responded
gerande
like
a
plaintive
echo
pittonaccio
began
to
laugh
you
wish
me
to
die
then
exclaimed
the
old
man
there
in
that
clock
the
last
which
goes
of
all
which
have
gone
from
my
hands
my
life
is
shut
up
and
this
man
tells
me
i
have
thy
daughter
this
clock
shall
belong
to
thee
and
this
man
will
not
rewind
it
he
can
break
it
and
plunge
me
into
chaos
ah
my
daughter
you
no
longer
love
me
my
father
murmured
gerande
recovering
consciousness
if
you
knew
what
i
have
suffered
far
away
from
this
principle
of
my
existence
resumed
the
old
man
perhaps
no
one
looked
after
this
timepiece
perhaps
its
springs
were
left
to
wear
out
its
wheels
to
get
clogged
but
now
in
my
own
hands
i
can
nourish
this
health
so
dear
for
i
must
not
die
i
the
great
watchmaker
of
geneva
look
my
daughter
how
these
hands
advance
with
certain
step
see
five
is
about
to
strike
listen
well
and
look
at
the
maxim
which
is
about
to
be
revealed
five
struck
with
a
noise
which
resounded
sadly
in
gerande
soul
and
these
words
appeared
in
red
letters
you
must
eat
of
the
fruits
of
the
tree
of
science
aubert
and
gerande
looked
at
each
other
stupefied
these
were
no
longer
the
pious
sayings
of
the
catholic
watchmaker
the
breath
of
satan
must
have
passed
over
it
but
zacharius
paid
no
attention
to
this
and
resumed
dost
thou
hear
my
gerande
i
live
i
still
live
listen
to
my
breathing
see
the
blood
circulating
in
my
veins
no
thou
wouldst
not
kill
thy
father
and
thou
wilt
accept
this
man
for
thy
husband
so
that
i
may
become
immortal
and
at
last
attain
the
power
of
god
at
these
blasphemous
words
old
scholastique
crossed
herself
and
pittonaccio
laughed
aloud
with
joy
and
then
gerande
thou
wilt
be
happy
with
him
see
this
man
he
is
time
thy
existence
will
be
regulated
with
absolute
precision
gerande
since
i
gave
thee
life
give
life
to
thy
father
illustration
see
this
man
he
is
time
gerande
murmured
aubert
i
am
thy
betrothed
he
is
my
father
replied
gerande
fainting
she
is
thine
said
master
zacharius
pittonaccio
them
wilt
keep
thy
promise
here
is
the
key
of
the
clock
replied
the
horrible
man
master
zacharius
seized
the
long
key
which
resembled
an
uncoiled
snake
and
ran
to
the
clock
which
he
hastened
to
wind
up
with
fantastic
rapidity
the
creaking
of
the
spring
jarred
upon
the
nerves
the
old
watchmaker
wound
and
wound
the
key
without
stopping
a
moment
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
movement
were
beyond
his
control
he
wound
more
and
more
quickly
with
strange
contortions
until
he
fell
from
sheer
weariness
there
it
is
wound
up
for
a
century
he
cried
aubert
rushed
from
the
hall
as
if
he
were
mad
after
long
wandering
he
found
the
outlet
of
the
hateful
château
and
hastened
into
the
open
air
he
returned
to
the
hermitage
of
and
talked
so
despairingly
to
the
holy
recluse
that
the
latter
consented
to
return
with
him
to
the
château
of
andernatt
if
during
these
hours
of
anguish
gerande
had
not
wept
it
was
because
her
tears
were
exhausted
master
zacharius
had
not
left
the
hall
he
ran
every
moment
to
listen
to
the
regular
beating
of
the
old
clock
meanwhile
the
clock
had
struck
and
to
scholastique
great
terror
these
words
had
appeared
on
the
silver
face
man
ought
to
become
the
equal
of
god
the
old
man
had
not
only
not
been
shocked
by
these
impious
maxims
but
read
them
deliriously
and
flattered
himself
with
thoughts
of
pride
whilst
pittonaccio
kept
close
by
him
the
was
to
be
signed
at
midnight
gerande
almost
unconscious
saw
or
heard
nothing
the
silence
was
only
broken
by
the
old
man
words
and
the
chuckling
of
pittonaccio
eleven
struck
master
zacharius
shuddered
and
read
in
a
loud
voice
man
should
be
the
slave
of
science
and
sacrifice
to
it
relatives
and
family
yes
he
cried
there
is
nothing
but
science
in
this
world
the
hands
slipped
over
the
face
of
the
clock
with
the
hiss
of
a
serpent
and
the
pendulum
beat
with
accelerated
strokes
master
zacharius
no
longer
spoke
he
had
fallen
to
the
floor
his
throat
rattled
and
from
his
oppressed
bosom
came
only
these
words
life
science
the
scene
had
now
two
new
witnesses
the
hermit
and
aubert
master
zacharius
lay
upon
the
floor
gerande
was
praying
beside
him
more
dead
than
alive
of
a
sudden
a
dry
hard
noise
was
heard
which
preceded
the
strike
master
zacharius
sprang
up
midnight
he
cried
the
hermit
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
the
old
clock
and
midnight
did
not
sound
master
zacharius
uttered
a
terrible
cry
which
must
have
been
heard
in
hell
when
these
words
appeared
who
ever
shall
attempt
to
make
himself
the
equal
of
god
shall
be
for
ever
damned
the
old
clock
burst
with
a
noise
like
thunder
and
the
spring
escaping
leaped
across
the
hall
with
a
thousand
fantastic
contortions
the
old
man
rose
ran
after
it
trying
in
vain
to
seize
it
and
exclaiming
my
soul
my
soul
the
spring
bounded
before
him
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
and
he
could
not
reach
it
at
last
pittonaccio
seized
it
and
uttering
a
horrible
blasphemy
ingulfed
himself
in
the
earth
master
zacharius
fell
backwards
he
was
dead
illustration
he
was
dead
the
old
watchmaker
was
buried
in
the
midst
of
the
peaks
of
andernatt
then
aubert
and
gerande
returned
to
geneva
and
during
the
long
life
which
god
accorded
to
them
they
made
it
a
duty
to
redeem
by
prayer
the
soul
of
the
castaway
of
science
a
drama
in
the
air
in
the
month
of
september
i
arrived
at
my
passage
through
the
principal
german
cities
had
been
brilliantly
marked
by
balloon
ascents
but
as
yet
no
german
had
accompanied
me
in
my
car
and
the
fine
experiments
made
at
paris
by
mm
green
eugene
godard
and
poitevin
had
not
tempted
the
grave
teutons
to
essay
aerial
voyages
but
scarcely
had
the
news
of
my
approaching
ascent
spread
through
frankfort
than
three
of
the
principal
citizens
begged
the
favour
of
being
allowed
to
ascend
with
me
two
days
afterwards
we
were
to
start
from
the
place
de
la
comédie
i
began
at
once
to
get
my
balloon
ready
it
was
of
silk
prepared
with
gutta
percha
a
substance
impermeable
by
acids
or
gasses
and
its
volume
which
was
three
thousand
cubic
yards
enabled
it
to
ascend
to
the
loftiest
heights
the
day
of
the
ascent
was
that
of
the
great
september
fair
which
attracts
so
many
people
to
frankfort
lighting
gas
of
a
perfect
quality
and
of
great
lifting
power
had
been
furnished
to
me
in
excellent
condition
and
about
eleven
the
balloon
was
filled
but
only
filled
an
indispensable
precaution
for
as
one
rises
the
atmosphere
diminishes
in
density
and
the
fluid
enclosed
within
the
balloon
acquiring
more
elasticity
might
burst
its
sides
my
calculations
had
furnished
me
with
exactly
the
quantity
of
gas
necessary
to
carry
up
my
companions
and
myself
we
were
to
start
at
noon
the
impatient
crowd
which
pressed
around
the
enclosed
space
filling
the
enclosed
square
overflowing
into
the
contiguous
streets
and
covering
the
houses
from
the
to
the
slated
gables
presented
a
striking
scene
the
high
winds
of
the
preceding
days
had
subsided
an
oppressive
heat
fell
from
the
cloudless
sky
scarcely
a
breath
animated
the
atmosphere
in
such
weather
one
might
descend
again
upon
the
very
spot
whence
he
had
risen
i
carried
three
hundred
pounds
of
ballast
in
bags
the
car
quite
round
four
feet
in
diameter
was
comfortably
arranged
the
hempen
cords
which
supported
it
stretched
symmetrically
over
the
upper
hemisphere
of
the
balloon
the
compass
was
in
place
the
barometer
suspended
in
the
circle
which
united
the
supporting
cords
and
the
anchor
carefully
put
in
order
all
was
now
ready
for
the
ascent
among
those
who
pressed
around
the
enclosure
i
remarked
a
young
man
with
a
pale
face
and
agitated
features
the
sight
of
him
impressed
me
he
was
an
eager
spectator
of
my
ascents
whom
i
had
already
met
in
several
german
cities
with
an
uneasy
air
he
closely
watched
the
curious
machine
as
it
lay
motionless
a
few
feet
above
the
ground
and
he
remained
silent
among
those
about
him
twelve
came
the
moment
had
arrived
but
my
travelling
companions
did
not
appear
i
sent
to
their
houses
and
learnt
that
one
had
left
for
hamburg
another
for
vienna
and
the
third
for
london
their
courage
had
failed
them
at
the
moment
of
undertaking
one
of
those
excursions
which
thanks
to
the
ability
of
living
aeronauts
are
free
from
all
danger
as
they
formed
in
some
sort
a
part
of
the
programme
of
the
day
the
fear
had
seized
them
that
they
might
be
forced
to
execute
it
faithfully
and
they
had
fled
far
from
the
scene
at
the
instant
when
the
balloon
was
being
filled
their
courage
was
evidently
the
inverse
ratio
of
their
speed
in
decamping
the
multitude
half
deceived
showed
not
a
little
i
did
not
hesitate
to
ascend
alone
in
order
to
the
equilibrium
between
the
specific
gravity
of
the
balloon
and
the
weight
which
had
thus
proved
wanting
i
replaced
my
companions
by
more
sacks
of
sand
and
got
into
the
car
the
twelve
men
who
held
the
balloon
by
twelve
cords
fastened
to
the
equatorial
circle
let
them
slip
a
little
between
their
fingers
and
the
balloon
rose
several
feet
higher
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
and
the
atmosphere
was
so
leaden
that
it
seemed
to
forbid
the
ascent
is
everything
ready
i
cried
the
men
put
themselves
in
readiness
a
last
glance
told
me
that
i
might
go
attention
there
was
a
movement
in
the
crowd
which
seemed
to
be
invading
the
enclosure
let
go
the
balloon
rose
slowly
but
i
experienced
a
shock
which
threw
me
to
the
bottom
of
the
car
when
i
got
up
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
an
unexpected
the
pale
young
man
monsieur
i
salute
you
said
he
with
the
utmost
coolness
illustration
monsieur
i
salute
you
by
what
right
am
i
here
by
the
right
which
the
impossibility
of
your
getting
rid
of
me
confers
i
was
amazed
his
calmness
put
me
out
of
countenance
and
i
had
nothing
to
reply
i
looked
at
the
intruder
but
he
took
no
notice
of
my
astonishment
does
my
weight
disarrange
your
equilibrium
monsieur
he
asked
you
will
permit
me
and
without
waiting
for
my
consent
he
relieved
the
balloon
of
two
bags
which
he
threw
into
space
monsieur
said
i
taking
the
only
course
now
possible
you
have
come
very
well
you
will
remain
but
to
me
alone
belongs
the
management
of
the
balloon
monsieur
said
he
your
urbanity
is
french
all
over
it
comes
from
my
own
country
i
morally
press
the
hand
you
refuse
me
make
all
precautions
and
act
as
seems
best
to
you
i
will
wait
till
you
have
done
for
what
to
talk
with
you
the
barometer
had
fallen
to
inches
we
were
nearly
six
hundred
yards
above
the
city
but
nothing
betrayed
the
horizontal
displacement
of
the
balloon
for
the
mass
of
air
in
which
it
is
enclosed
goes
forward
with
it
a
sort
of
confused
glow
enveloped
the
objects
spread
out
under
us
and
unfortunately
obscured
their
outline
i
examined
my
companion
afresh
he
was
a
man
of
thirty
years
simply
clad
the
sharpness
of
his
features
betrayed
an
indomitable
energy
and
he
seemed
very
muscular
indifferent
to
the
astonishment
he
created
he
remained
motionless
trying
to
distinguish
the
objects
which
were
vaguely
confused
below
us
miserable
mist
said
he
after
a
few
moments
i
did
not
reply
you
owe
me
a
grudge
he
went
on
bah
i
could
not
pay
for
my
journey
and
it
was
necessary
to
take
you
by
surprise
nobody
asks
you
to
descend
monsieur
eh
do
you
not
know
then
that
the
same
thing
happened
to
the
counts
of
laurencin
and
dampierre
when
they
ascended
at
lyons
on
the
of
january
a
young
merchant
named
fontaine
scaled
the
gallery
at
the
risk
of
capsizing
the
machine
he
accomplished
the
journey
and
nobody
died
of
it
once
on
the
ground
we
will
have
an
explanation
replied
i
piqued
at
the
light
tone
in
which
he
spoke
bah
do
not
let
us
think
of
our
return
do
you
think
then
that
i
shall
not
hasten
to
descend
descend
said
he
in
surprise
descend
let
us
begin
by
first
ascending
and
before
i
could
prevent
it
two
more
bags
had
been
thrown
over
the
car
without
even
having
been
emptied
monsieur
cried
i
in
a
rage
illustration
monsieur
cried
i
in
a
rage
i
know
your
ability
replied
the
unknown
quietly
and
your
fine
ascents
are
famous
but
if
experience
is
the
sister
of
practice
she
is
also
a
cousin
of
theory
and
i
have
studied
the
aerial
art
long
it
has
got
into
my
head
he
added
sadly
falling
into
a
silent
reverie
the
balloon
having
risen
some
distance
farther
now
became
stationary
the
unknown
consulted
the
barometer
and
said
here
we
are
at
eight
hundred
yards
men
are
like
insects
see
i
think
we
should
always
contemplate
them
from
this
height
to
judge
correctly
of
their
proportions
the
place
de
la
comédie
is
transformed
into
an
immense
observe
the
crowd
which
is
gathered
on
the
quays
and
the
mountains
also
get
smaller
and
smaller
we
are
over
the
cathedral
the
main
is
only
a
line
cutting
the
city
in
two
and
the
bridge
seems
a
thread
thrown
between
the
two
banks
of
the
river
the
atmosphere
became
somewhat
chilly
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
you
my
host
said
the
unknown
if
you
are
cold
i
will
take
off
my
coat
and
lend
it
to
you
thanks
said
i
dryly
bah
necessity
makes
law
give
me
your
hand
i
am
your
you
will
learn
something
in
my
company
and
my
conversation
will
indemnify
you
for
the
trouble
i
have
given
you
i
sat
down
without
replying
at
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
car
the
young
man
had
taken
a
voluminous
manuscript
from
his
it
was
an
essay
on
ballooning
i
possess
said
he
the
most
curious
collection
of
engravings
and
caricatures
extant
concerning
aerial
manias
how
people
admired
and
scoffed
at
the
same
time
at
this
precious
discovery
we
are
happily
no
longer
in
the
age
in
which
montgolfier
tried
to
make
artificial
clouds
with
steam
or
a
gas
having
electrical
properties
produced
by
the
combustion
of
moist
straw
and
wool
do
you
wish
to
depreciate
the
talent
of
the
inventors
i
asked
for
i
had
resolved
to
enter
into
the
adventure
was
it
not
good
to
have
proved
by
experience
the
possibility
of
rising
in
the
air
ah
monsieur
who
denies
the
glory
of
the
first
aerial
navigators
it
required
immense
courage
to
rise
by
means
of
those
frail
envelopes
which
only
contained
heated
air
but
i
ask
you
has
the
aerial
science
made
great
progress
since
ascensions
that
is
since
nearly
a
century
ago
look
here
monsieur
the
unknown
took
an
engraving
from
his
portfolio
here
said
he
is
the
first
aerial
voyage
undertaken
by
pilâtre
des
rosiers
and
the
marquis
four
months
after
the
discovery
of
balloons
louis
xvi
refused
to
consent
to
the
venture
and
two
men
who
were
condemned
to
death
were
the
first
to
attempt
the
aerial
ascent
pilâtre
des
rosiers
became
indignant
at
this
injustice
and
by
means
of
intrigues
obtained
permission
to
make
the
experiment
the
car
which
renders
the
management
easy
had
not
then
been
invented
and
a
circular
gallery
was
placed
around
the
lower
and
contracted
part
of
the
montgolfier
balloon
the
two
aeronauts
must
then
remain
motionless
at
each
extremity
of
this
gallery
for
the
moist
straw
which
filled
it
forbade
them
all
motion
a
with
fire
was
suspended
below
the
orifice
of
the
balloon
when
the
aeronauts
wished
to
rise
they
threw
straw
upon
this
brazier
at
the
risk
of
setting
fire
to
the
balloon
and
the
air
more
heated
gave
it
fresh
ascending
power
the
two
bold
travellers
rose
on
the
of
november
from
the
muette
gardens
which
the
dauphin
had
put
at
their
disposal
the
balloon
went
up
majestically
passed
over
the
isle
of
swans
crossed
the
seine
at
the
conference
barrier
and
drifting
between
the
dome
of
the
invalides
and
the
military
school
approached
the
church
of
saint
sulpice
then
the
aeronauts
added
to
the
fire
crossed
the
boulevard
and
descended
beyond
the
enfer
barrier
as
it
touched
the
soil
the
balloon
collapsed
and
for
a
few
moments
buried
pilâtre
des
rosiers
under
its
folds
unlucky
augury
i
said
interested
in
the
story
which
affected
me
nearly
an
augury
of
the
catastrophe
which
was
later
to
cost
this
unfortunate
man
his
life
replied
the
unknown
sadly
have
you
never
experienced
anything
like
it
never
bah
misfortunes
sometimes
occur
unforeshadowed
added
my
companion
he
then
remained
silent
meanwhile
we
were
advancing
southward
and
frankfort
had
already
passed
from
beneath
us
perhaps
we
shall
have
a
storm
said
the
young
man
we
shall
descend
before
that
i
replied
indeed
it
is
better
to
ascend
we
shall
escape
it
more
surely
and
two
more
bags
of
sand
were
hurled
into
space
the
balloon
rose
rapidly
and
stopped
at
twelve
hundred
yards
i
became
colder
and
yet
the
sun
rays
falling
upon
the
surface
expanded
the
gas
within
and
gave
it
a
greater
ascending
force
fear
nothing
said
the
unknown
we
have
still
three
thousand
five
hundred
fathoms
of
breathing
air
besides
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
what
i
do
i
would
have
risen
but
a
vigorous
hand
held
me
to
my
seat
your
name
i
asked
my
name
what
matters
it
to
you
i
demand
your
name
my
name
is
erostratus
or
empedocles
whichever
you
choose
this
reply
was
far
from
reassuring
the
unknown
besides
talked
with
such
strange
coolness
that
i
anxiously
asked
myself
whom
i
had
to
deal
with
monsieur
he
continued
nothing
original
has
been
imagined
since
the
physicist
charles
four
months
after
the
discovery
of
balloons
this
able
man
had
invented
the
valve
which
permits
the
gas
to
escape
when
the
balloon
is
too
full
or
when
you
wish
to
descend
the
car
which
aids
the
management
of
the
machine
the
netting
which
holds
the
envelope
of
the
balloon
and
divides
the
weight
over
its
whole
surface
the
ballast
which
enables
you
to
ascend
and
to
choose
the
place
of
your
landing
the
coating
which
renders
the
tissue
impermeable
the
barometer
which
shows
the
height
attained
lastly
charles
used
hydrogen
which
fourteen
times
lighter
than
air
permits
you
to
penetrate
to
the
highest
atmospheric
regions
and
does
not
expose
you
to
the
dangers
of
a
combustion
in
the
air
on
the
of
december
three
hundred
thousand
spectators
were
crowded
around
the
tuileries
charles
rose
and
the
soldiers
presented
arms
to
him
he
travelled
nine
leagues
in
the
air
conducting
his
balloon
with
an
ability
not
surpassed
by
modern
aeronauts
the
king
awarded
him
a
pension
of
two
thousand
livres
for
then
they
encouraged
new
inventions
the
unknown
now
seemed
to
be
under
the
influence
of
considerable
agitation
monsieur
he
resumed
i
have
studied
this
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
first
aeronauts
guided
their
balloons
without
speaking
of
blanchard
whose
assertions
may
be
received
with
doubt
by
the
aid
of
oars
and
rudder
made
his
machine
answer
to
the
helm
and
take
the
direction
he
determined
on
more
recently
julien
a
watchmaker
made
some
convincing
experiments
at
the
hippodrome
in
paris
for
by
a
special
mechanism
his
aerial
apparatus
oblong
in
form
went
visibly
against
the
wind
it
occurred
to
petin
to
place
four
hydrogen
balloons
together
and
by
means
of
sails
hung
horizontally
and
partly
folded
he
hopes
to
be
able
to
disturb
the
equilibrium
and
thus
inclining
the
apparatus
to
convey
it
in
an
oblique
direction
they
speak
also
of
forces
to
overcome
the
resistance
of
currents
for
instance
the
screw
but
the
screw
working
on
a
moveable
centre
will
give
no
result
i
monsieur
have
discovered
the
only
means
of
guiding
balloons
and
no
academy
has
come
to
my
aid
no
city
has
filled
up
subscriptions
for
me
no
government
has
thought
fit
to
listen
to
me
it
is
infamous
the
unknown
gesticulated
fiercely
and
the
car
underwent
violent
oscillations
i
had
much
trouble
in
calming
him
meanwhile
the
balloon
had
entered
a
more
rapid
current
and
we
advanced
south
at
fifteen
hundred
yards
above
the
earth
see
there
is
darmstadt
said
my
companion
leaning
over
the
car
do
you
perceive
the
château
not
very
distinctly
eh
what
would
you
have
the
heat
of
the
storm
makes
the
outline
of
objects
waver
and
you
must
have
a
skilled
eye
to
recognize
localities
are
you
certain
it
is
darmstadt
i
asked
i
am
sure
of
it
we
are
now
six
leagues
from
frankfort
then
we
must
descend
descend
you
would
not
go
down
on
the
steeples
said
the
unknown
with
a
chuckle
no
but
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
well
let
us
avoid
the
steeples
so
speaking
my
companion
seized
some
bags
of
ballast
i
hastened
to
prevent
him
but
he
overthrew
me
with
one
hand
and
the
unballasted
balloon
ascended
to
two
thousand
yards
rest
easy
said
he
and
do
not
forget
that
brioschi
biot
bixio
and
barral
ascended
to
still
greater
heights
to
make
their
scientific
experiments
monsieur
we
must
descend
i
resumed
trying
to
persuade
him
by
gentleness
the
storm
is
gathering
around
us
it
would
be
more
prudent
bah
we
will
mount
higher
than
the
storm
and
then
we
shall
no
longer
fear
it
cried
my
companion
what
is
nobler
than
to
overlook
the
clouds
which
oppress
the
earth
is
it
not
an
honour
thus
to
navigate
on
aerial
billows
the
greatest
men
have
travelled
as
we
are
doing
the
marchioness
and
countess
de
montalembert
the
countess
of
podenas
mademoiselle
la
garde
the
marquis
de
montalembert
rose
from
the
faubourg
for
these
unknown
regions
and
the
duke
de
chartres
exhibited
much
skill
and
presence
of
mind
in
his
ascent
on
the
of
july
at
lyons
the
counts
of
laurencin
and
dampierre
at
nantes
de
luynes
at
bordeaux
des
granges
in
italy
the
chevalier
andreani
in
our
own
time
the
duke
of
brunswick
have
all
left
the
traces
of
their
glory
in
the
air
to
equal
these
great
personages
we
must
penetrate
still
higher
than
they
into
the
celestial
depths
to
approach
the
infinite
is
to
comprehend
it
the
rarefaction
of
the
air
was
fast
expanding
the
hydrogen
in
the
balloon
and
i
saw
its
lower
part
purposely
left
empty
swell
out
so
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
open
the
valve
but
my
companion
did
not
seem
to
intend
that
i
should
manage
the
balloon
as
i
wished
i
then
resolved
to
pull
the
valve
cord
secretly
as
he
was
excitedly
talking
for
i
feared
to
guess
with
whom
i
had
to
deal
it
would
have
been
too
horrible
it
was
nearly
a
quarter
before
one
we
had
been
gone
forty
minutes
from
frankfort
heavy
clouds
were
coming
against
the
wind
from
the
south
and
seemed
about
to
burst
upon
us
have
you
lost
all
hope
of
succeeding
in
your
project
i
asked
with
anxious
interest
all
hope
exclaimed
the
unknown
in
a
low
voice
wounded
by
slights
and
caricatures
these
asses
kicks
have
finished
me
it
is
the
eternal
punishment
reserved
for
innovators
look
at
these
caricatures
of
all
periods
of
which
my
portfolio
is
full
while
my
companion
was
fumbling
with
his
papers
i
had
seized
the
without
his
perceiving
it
i
feared
however
that
he
might
hear
the
hissing
noise
like
a
which
the
gas
makes
in
escaping
how
many
jokes
were
made
about
the
abbé
miolan
said
he
he
was
to
go
up
with
janninet
and
bredin
during
the
filling
their
balloon
caught
fire
and
the
ignorant
populace
tore
it
in
pieces
then
this
caricature
of
animals
appeared
giving
each
of
them
a
punning
nickname
i
pulled
the
and
the
barometer
began
to
ascend
it
was
time
some
rumblings
were
heard
in
the
south
here
is
another
engraving
resumed
the
unknown
not
suspecting
what
i
was
doing
it
is
an
immense
balloon
carrying
a
ship
strong
castles
houses
and
so
on
the
caricaturists
did
not
suspect
that
their
follies
would
one
day
become
truths
it
is
complete
this
large
vessel
on
the
left
is
its
helm
with
the
pilot
box
at
the
prow
are
an
immense
organ
and
a
cannon
to
call
the
attention
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
or
the
moon
above
the
poop
there
are
the
observatory
and
the
balloon
in
the
equatorial
circle
the
army
barrack
on
the
left
the
funnel
then
the
upper
galleries
for
promenading
sails
pinions
below
the
cafés
and
general
storehouse
observe
this
pompous
announcement
for
the
happiness
of
the
human
race
this
globe
will
depart
at
once
for
the
ports
of
the
levant
and
on
its
return
the
programme
of
its
voyages
to
the
two
poles
and
the
extreme
west
will
be
announced
no
one
need
furnish
himself
with
anything
everything
is
foreseen
and
all
will
prosper
there
will
be
a
uniform
price
for
all
places
of
destination
but
it
will
be
the
same
for
the
most
distant
countries
of
our
hemisphere
that
is
to
say
a
thousand
louis
for
one
of
any
of
the
said
journeys
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
this
sum
is
very
moderate
when
the
speed
comfort
and
arrangements
which
will
be
enjoyed
on
the
balloon
are
considered
arrangements
which
are
not
to
be
found
on
land
while
on
the
balloon
each
passenger
may
consult
his
own
habits
and
tastes
this
is
so
true
that
in
the
same
place
some
will
be
dancing
others
standing
some
will
be
enjoying
delicacies
others
fasting
whoever
desires
the
society
of
wits
may
satisfy
himself
whoever
is
stupid
may
find
stupid
people
to
keep
him
company
thus
pleasure
will
be
the
soul
of
the
aerial
company
all
this
provoked
laughter
but
before
long
if
i
am
not
cut
off
they
will
see
it
all
realized
we
were
visibly
descending
he
did
not
perceive
it
this
kind
of
at
balloons
he
resumed
spreading
out
before
me
some
of
the
engravings
of
his
valuable
collection
this
game
contains
the
entire
history
of
the
aerostatic
art
it
is
used
by
elevated
minds
and
is
played
with
dice
and
counters
with
whatever
stakes
you
like
to
be
paid
or
received
according
to
where
the
player
arrives
why
said
i
you
seem
to
have
studied
the
science
of
aerostation
profoundly
yes
monsieur
yes
from
phaethon
icarus
architas
i
have
searched
for
examined
learnt
everything
i
could
render
immense
services
to
the
world
in
this
art
if
god
granted
me
life
but
that
will
not
be
why
because
my
name
is
empedocles
or
erostratus
meanwhile
the
balloon
was
happily
approaching
the
earth
but
when
one
is
falling
the
danger
is
as
great
at
a
hundred
feet
as
at
five
thousand
do
you
recall
the
battle
of
fleurus
resumed
my
companion
whose
face
became
more
and
more
animated
it
was
at
that
battle
that
contello
by
order
of
the
government
organized
a
company
of
balloonists
at
the
siege
of
manbenge
general
jourdan
derived
so
much
service
from
this
new
method
of
observation
that
contello
ascended
twice
a
day
with
the
general
himself
the
communications
between
the
aeronaut
and
his
agents
who
held
the
balloon
were
made
by
means
of
small
white
red
and
yellow
flags
often
the
gun
and
cannon
shot
were
directed
upon
the
balloon
when
he
ascended
but
without
result
when
general
jourdan
was
preparing
to
invest
charleroi
contello
went
into
the
vicinity
ascended
from
the
plain
of
jumet
and
continued
his
observations
for
seven
or
eight
hours
with
general
morlot
and
this
no
doubt
aided
in
giving
us
the
victory
of
fleurus
general
jourdan
publicly
acknowledged
the
help
which
the
aeronautical
observations
had
afforded
him
well
despite
the
services
rendered
on
that
occasion
and
during
the
belgian
campaign
the
year
which
had
seen
the
beginning
of
the
military
career
of
balloons
saw
also
its
end
the
school
of
meudon
founded
by
the
government
was
closed
by
buonaparte
on
his
return
from
egypt
and
now
what
can
you
expect
from
the
infant
as
franklin
said
the
infant
was
born
alive
it
should
not
be
stifled
illustration
he
continued
his
observations
for
seven
or
eight
hours
with
general
morlot
the
unknown
bowed
his
head
in
his
hands
and
reflected
for
some
moments
then
raising
his
head
he
said
despite
my
prohibition
monsieur
you
have
opened
the
valve
i
dropped
the
cord
happily
he
resumed
we
have
still
three
hundred
pounds
of
ballast
what
is
your
purpose
said
i
have
you
ever
crossed
the
seas
he
asked
i
turned
pale
it
is
unfortunate
he
went
on
that
we
are
being
driven
towards
the
adriatic
that
is
only
a
stream
but
higher
up
we
may
find
other
currents
and
without
taking
any
notice
of
me
he
threw
over
several
bags
of
sand
then
in
a
menacing
voice
he
said
i
let
you
open
the
valve
because
the
expansion
of
the
gas
threatened
to
burst
the
balloon
but
do
not
do
it
again
then
he
went
on
as
follows
you
remember
the
voyage
of
blanchard
and
jeffries
from
dover
to
calais
it
was
magnificent
on
the
of
january
there
being
a
wind
their
balloon
was
inflated
with
gas
on
the
dover
coast
a
mistake
of
equilibrium
just
as
they
were
ascending
forced
them
to
throw
out
their
ballast
so
that
they
might
not
go
down
again
and
they
only
kept
thirty
pounds
it
was
too
little
for
as
the
wind
did
not
freshen
they
only
advanced
very
slowly
towards
the
french
coast
besides
the
permeability
of
the
tissue
served
to
reduce
the
inflation
little
by
little
and
in
an
hour
and
a
half
the
aeronauts
perceived
that
they
were
descending
shall
we
do
said
jeffries
are
only
one
quarter
of
the
way
over
replied
blanchard
very
low
down
on
rising
we
shall
perhaps
meet
more
favourable
winds
us
throw
out
the
rest
of
the
sand
the
balloon
acquired
some
ascending
force
but
it
soon
began
to
descend
again
towards
the
middle
of
the
transit
the
aeronauts
threw
over
their
books
and
tools
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
blanchard
said
to
jeffries
barometer
is
going
up
we
are
lost
and
yet
there
is
the
french
coast
a
loud
noise
was
heard
the
balloon
burst
asked
jeffries
the
loss
of
the
gas
has
reduced
the
inflation
of
the
lower
part
of
the
balloon
but
we
are
still
descending
we
are
lost
out
with
everything
useless
provisions
oars
and
rudder
were
thrown
into
the
sea
the
aeronauts
were
only
one
hundred
yards
high
are
going
up
again
said
the
doctor
it
is
the
spurt
caused
by
the
diminution
of
the
weight
and
not
a
ship
in
sight
not
a
bark
on
the
horizon
to
the
sea
with
our
clothing
the
unfortunates
stripped
themselves
but
the
balloon
continued
to
descend
said
jeffries
should
have
made
this
voyage
alone
you
consented
to
take
me
i
will
sacrifice
myself
i
am
going
to
throw
myself
into
the
water
and
the
balloon
relieved
of
my
weight
will
mount
again
no
it
is
frightful
the
balloon
became
less
and
less
inflated
and
as
it
doubled
up
its
concavity
pressed
the
gas
against
the
sides
and
hastened
its
downward
course
illustration
the
balloon
became
less
and
less
inflated
my
friend
said
the
doctor
preserve
you
he
was
about
to
throw
himself
over
when
blanchard
held
him
back
is
one
more
chance
said
he
can
cut
the
cords
which
hold
the
car
and
cling
to
the
net
perhaps
the
balloon
will
rise
let
us
hold
ourselves
ready
but
the
barometer
is
going
down
the
wind
is
freshening
we
are
saved
the
aeronauts
perceived
calais
their
joy
was
delirious
a
few
moments
more
and
they
had
fallen
in
the
forest
of
guines
i
do
not
doubt
added
the
unknown
that
under
similar
circumstances
you
would
have
followed
doctor
jeffries
example
the
clouds
rolled
in
glittering
masses
beneath
us
the
balloon
threw
large
shadows
on
this
heap
of
clouds
and
was
surrounded
as
by
an
aureola
the
thunder
rumbled
below
the
car
all
this
was
terrifying
let
us
descend
i
cried
descend
when
the
sun
is
up
there
waiting
for
us
out
with
more
bags
and
more
than
fifty
pounds
of
ballast
were
cast
over
at
a
height
of
three
thousand
five
hundred
yards
we
remained
stationary
the
unknown
talked
unceasingly
i
was
in
a
state
of
complete
prostration
while
he
seemed
to
be
in
his
element
with
a
good
wind
we
shall
go
far
he
cried
in
the
antilles
there
are
currents
of
air
which
have
a
speed
of
a
hundred
leagues
an
hour
when
napoleon
was
crowned
garnerin
sent
up
a
balloon
with
coloured
lamps
at
eleven
at
night
the
wind
was
blowing
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
the
inhabitants
of
rome
greeted
its
passage
over
the
dome
of
peter
we
shall
go
farther
and
higher
i
scarcely
heard
him
everything
whirled
around
me
an
opening
appeared
in
the
clouds
see
that
city
said
the
unknown
it
is
spires
i
leaned
over
the
car
and
perceived
a
small
blackish
mass
it
was
spires
the
rhine
which
is
so
large
seemed
an
unrolled
ribbon
the
sky
was
a
deep
blue
over
our
heads
the
birds
had
long
abandoned
us
for
in
that
rarefied
air
they
could
not
have
flown
we
were
alone
in
space
and
i
in
presence
of
this
unknown
it
is
useless
for
you
to
know
whither
i
am
leading
you
he
said
as
he
threw
the
compass
among
the
clouds
ah
a
fall
is
a
grand
thing
you
know
that
but
few
victims
of
ballooning
are
to
be
reckoned
from
pilâtre
des
rosiers
to
lieutenant
gale
and
that
the
accidents
have
always
been
the
result
of
imprudence
pilâtre
des
rosiers
set
out
with
romain
of
boulogne
on
the
of
june
to
his
gas
balloon
he
had
affixed
a
montgolfier
apparatus
of
hot
air
so
as
to
dispense
no
doubt
with
the
necessity
of
losing
gas
or
throwing
out
ballast
it
was
putting
a
torch
under
a
when
they
had
ascended
four
hundred
yards
and
were
taken
by
opposing
winds
they
were
driven
over
the
open
sea
pilâtre
in
order
to
descend
essayed
to
open
the
valve
but
the
became
entangled
in
the
balloon
and
tore
it
so
badly
that
it
became
empty
in
an
instant
it
fell
upon
the
montgolfier
apparatus
overturned
it
and
dragged
down
the
unfortunates
who
were
soon
shattered
to
pieces
it
is
frightful
is
it
not
i
could
only
reply
for
pity
sake
let
us
descend
the
clouds
gathered
around
us
on
every
side
and
dreadful
detonations
which
reverberated
in
the
cavity
of
the
balloon
took
place
beneath
us
you
provoke
me
cried
the
unknown
and
you
shall
no
longer
know
whether
we
are
rising
or
falling
the
barometer
went
the
way
of
the
compass
accompanied
by
several
more
bags
of
sand
we
must
have
been
yards
high
some
icicles
had
already
attached
themselves
to
the
sides
of
the
car
and
a
kind
of
fine
snow
seemed
to
penetrate
to
my
very
bones
meanwhile
a
frightful
tempest
was
raging
under
us
but
we
were
above
it
do
not
be
afraid
said
the
unknown
it
is
only
the
imprudent

olivari

in
a
badly
constructed
balloon
the
valve
of
which
was
too
large
and

still

all
the
phantoms
of
this
necrology
passed
before
my
eyes
the
rarefaction
of
the
air
and
the
sun
rays
added
to
the
expansion
of
the
gas
and
the
balloon
continued
to
mount
i
tried
mechanically
to
open
the
valve
but
the
unknown
cut
the
cord
several
feet
above
my
head
i
was
lost
did
you
see
madame
blanchard
fall
said
he
i
saw
her
yes
i
i
was
at
tivoli
on
the
of
july
madame
blanchard
rose
in
a
small
sized
balloon
to
avoid
the
expense
of
filling
and
she
was
forced
to
entirely
inflate
it
the
gas
leaked
out
below
and
left
a
regular
train
of
hydrogen
in
its
path
she
carried
with
her
a
sort
of
pyrotechnic
aureola
suspended
below
her
car
by
a
wire
which
she
was
to
set
off
in
the
air
this
she
had
done
many
times
before
on
this
day
she
also
carried
up
a
small
parachute
ballasted
by
a
firework
contrivance
that
would
go
off
in
a
shower
of
silver
she
was
to
start
this
contrivance
after
having
lighted
it
with
a
made
on
purpose
she
set
out
the
night
was
gloomy
at
the
moment
of
lighting
her
fireworks
she
was
so
imprudent
as
to
pass
the
taper
under
the
column
of
hydrogen
which
was
leaking
from
the
balloon
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
suddenly
an
unexpected
gleam
lit
up
the
darkness
i
thought
she
was
preparing
a
surprise
the
light
flashed
out
suddenly
disappeared
and
reappeared
and
gave
the
summit
of
the
balloon
the
shape
of
an
immense
jet
of
ignited
gas
this
sinister
glow
shed
itself
over
the
boulevard
and
the
whole
montmartre
quarter
then
i
saw
the
unhappy
woman
rise
try
twice
to
close
the
appendage
of
the
balloon
so
as
to
put
out
the
fire
then
sit
down
in
her
car
and
try
to
guide
her
descent
for
she
did
not
fall
the
combustion
of
the
gas
lasted
for
several
minutes
the
balloon
becoming
gradually
less
continued
to
descend
but
it
was
not
a
fall
the
wind
blew
from
the
and
drove
it
towards
paris
there
were
then
some
large
gardens
just
by
the
house
no
rue
de
provence
madame
blanchard
essayed
to
fall
there
without
danger
but
the
balloon
and
the
car
struck
on
the
roof
of
the
house
with
a
light
shock
me
cried
the
wretched
woman
i
got
into
the
street
at
this
moment
the
car
slid
along
the
roof
and
encountered
an
iron
cramp
at
this
concussion
madame
blanchard
was
thrown
out
of
her
car
and
precipitated
upon
the
pavement
she
was
killed
these
stories
froze
me
with
horror
the
unknown
was
standing
with
bare
head
dishevelled
hair
haggard
eyes
there
was
no
longer
any
illusion
possible
i
at
last
recognized
the
horrible
truth
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
madman
he
threw
out
the
rest
of
the
ballast
and
we
must
have
now
reached
a
height
of
at
least
nine
thousand
yards
blood
spurted
from
my
nose
and
mouth
who
are
nobler
than
the
martyrs
of
science
cried
the
lunatic
they
are
canonized
by
posterity
but
i
no
longer
heard
him
he
looked
about
him
and
bending
down
to
my
ear
muttered
and
have
you
forgotten
zambecarri
catastrophe
listen
on
the
of
october
the
clouds
seemed
to
lift
a
little
on
the
preceding
days
the
wind
and
rain
had
not
ceased
but
the
announced
ascension
of
zambecarri
could
not
be
postponed
his
enemies
were
already
bantering
him
it
was
necessary
to
ascend
to
save
the
science
and
himself
from
becoming
a
public
jest
it
was
at
boulogne
no
one
helped
him
to
inflate
his
balloon
he
rose
at
midnight
accompanied
by
andreoli
and
grossetti
the
balloon
mounted
slowly
for
it
had
been
perforated
by
the
rain
and
the
gas
was
leaking
out
the
three
intrepid
aeronauts
could
only
observe
the
state
of
the
barometer
by
aid
of
a
dark
lantern
zambecarri
had
eaten
nothing
for
hours
grossetti
was
also
fasting
friends
said
zambecarri
am
overcome
by
cold
and
exhausted
i
am
dying
he
fell
inanimate
in
the
gallery
it
was
the
same
with
grossetti
andreoli
alone
remained
conscious
after
long
efforts
he
succeeded
in
reviving
zambecarri
news
whither
are
we
going
how
is
the
wind
what
time
is
it
is
two
is
the
compass
god
the
lantern
has
gone
out
can
not
burn
in
this
rarefied
air
said
zambecarri
the
moon
had
not
risen
and
the
atmosphere
was
plunged
in
murky
darkness
am
cold
andreoli
what
shall
i
do
they
slowly
descended
through
a
layer
of
whitish
clouds
said
andreoli
you
hear
asked
zambecarri
strange
noise
are
mistaken
consider
these
travellers
in
the
middle
of
the
night
listening
to
that
unaccountable
noise
are
they
going
to
knock
against
a
tower
are
they
about
to
be
precipitated
on
the
roofs
you
hear
one
would
say
it
was
the
noise
of
the
sea
is
the
groaning
of
the
waves
is
true
light
after
five
fruitless
attempts
andreoli
succeeded
in
obtaining
light
it
was
three
the
voice
of
violent
waves
was
heard
they
were
almost
touching
the
surface
of
the
sea
are
lost
cried
zambecarri
seizing
a
large
bag
of
sand
cried
andreoli
the
car
touched
the
water
and
the
waves
came
up
to
their
breasts
out
the
instruments
clothes
money
the
aeronauts
completely
stripped
themselves
the
balloon
relieved
rose
with
frightful
rapidity
zambecarri
was
taken
with
vomiting
grossetti
bled
profusely
the
unfortunate
men
could
not
speak
so
short
was
their
breathing
they
were
taken
with
cold
and
they
were
soon
crusted
over
with
ice
the
moon
looked
as
red
as
blood
after
traversing
the
high
regions
for
a
the
balloon
again
fell
into
the
sea
it
was
four
in
the
morning
they
were
half
submerged
in
the
water
and
the
balloon
dragged
them
along
as
if
under
sail
for
several
hours
at
daybreak
they
found
themselves
opposite
pesaro
four
miles
from
the
coast
they
were
about
to
reach
it
when
a
gale
blew
them
back
into
the
open
sea
they
were
lost
the
frightened
boats
fled
at
their
approach
happily
a
more
intelligent
boatman
accosted
them
hoisted
them
on
board
and
they
landed
at
ferrada
a
frightful
journey
was
it
not
but
zambecarri
was
a
brave
and
energetic
man
scarcely
recovered
from
his
sufferings
he
resumed
his
ascensions
during
one
of
them
he
struck
against
a
tree
his
was
broken
on
his
clothes
he
was
enveloped
in
fire
his
balloon
began
to
catch
the
flames
and
he
came
down
half
consumed
at
last
on
the
of
september
he
made
another
ascension
at
boulogne
the
balloon
clung
to
a
tree
and
his
lamp
again
set
it
on
fire
zambecarri
fell
and
was
killed
and
in
presence
of
these
facts
we
would
still
hesitate
no
the
higher
we
go
the
more
glorious
will
be
our
death
illustration
zambecarri
fell
and
was
killed
the
balloon
being
now
entirely
relieved
of
ballast
and
of
all
it
contained
we
were
carried
to
an
enormous
height
it
vibrated
in
the
atmosphere
the
least
noise
resounded
in
the
vaults
of
heaven
our
globe
the
only
object
which
caught
my
view
in
immensity
seemed
ready
to
be
annihilated
and
above
us
the
depths
of
the
starry
skies
were
lost
in
thick
darkness
i
saw
my
companion
rise
up
before
me
the
hour
is
come
he
said
we
must
die
we
are
rejected
of
men
they
despise
us
let
us
crush
them
mercy
i
cried
let
us
cut
these
cords
let
this
car
be
abandoned
in
space
the
attractive
force
will
change
its
direction
and
we
shall
approach
the
sun
despair
galvanized
me
i
threw
myself
upon
the
madman
we
struggled
together
and
a
terrible
conflict
took
place
but
i
was
thrown
down
and
while
he
held
me
under
his
knee
the
madman
was
cutting
the
cords
of
the
car
one
he
cried
my
god
two
three
i
made
a
superhuman
effort
rose
up
and
violently
repulsed
the
madman
four
the
car
fell
but
i
instinctively
clung
to
the
cords
and
hoisted
myself
into
the
meshes
of
the
netting
the
madman
disappeared
in
space

the
madman
disappeared

the
balloon
was
raised
to
an
immeasurable
height
a
horrible
cracking
was
heard
the
gas
too
much
dilated
had
burst

i
shut
my
eyes
some
instants
after
a
damp
warmth
revived
me
i
was
in

midst

clouds
on

the
balloon
turned
over
with
dizzy
velocity
taken
by
the
wind
it
made
a
hundred
leagues
an
hour
in
a
horizontal
course
the
lightning
flashing
around
it
meanwhile
my
fall
was
not
a
very
rapid
one
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
saw
the
country
i
was
two
miles
from
the
sea
and
the
tempest
was
driving
me
violently
towards
it
when
an
abrupt
shock
forced
me
to
loosen
my
hold
my
hands
opened
a
cord
slipped
swiftly
between
my
fingers
and
i
found
myself
on
the
solid
earth
it
was
the
cord
of
the
anchor
which
sweeping
along
the
surface
of
the
ground
was
caught
in
a
crevice
and
my
balloon
unballasted
for
the
last
time
careered
off
to
lose
itself
beyond

i
came
to
myself

saved

a
series

imprudences
committed
by

had
not

prevent

the
curé
of
the
ancient
church
of
dunkirk
rose
at
five
on
the
of
may
to
perform
according
to
his
custom
low
mass
for
the
benefit
of
a
few
pious
sinners
attired
in
his
priestly
robes
he
was
about
to
proceed
to
the
altar
when
a
man
entered
the
sacristy
at
once
joyous
and
frightened
he
was
a
sailor
of
some
sixty
years
but
still
vigorous
and
sturdy
with
an
open
honest
countenance
monsieur
the
curé
said
he
stop
a
moment
if
you
please

monsieur
the
curé
said
he
stop
a
moment
if
you
please
what
do
you
want
so
early
in
the
morning
jean
cornbutte
asked
the
curé
what
do
i
want
why
to
embrace
you
in
my
arms
i
faith
well
after
the
mass
at
which
you
are
going
to
be
present
the
mass
returned
the
old
sailor
laughing
do
you
think
you
are
going
to
say
your
mass
now
and
that
i
will
let
you
do
so
and
why
should
i
not
say
my
mass
asked
the
curé
explain
yourself
the
third
bell
has
sounded
whether
it
has
or
not
replied
jean
cornbutte
it
will
sound
many
more
times
monsieur
the
curé
for
you
have
promised
me
that
you
will
bless
with
your
own
hands
the
marriage
of
my
son
louis
and
my
niece
marie
he
has
arrived
then
said
the
curé
joyfully
it
is
nearly
the
same
thing
replied
cornbutte
rubbing
his
hands
our
brig
was
signalled
from
the
look
out
at
sunrise
our
brig
which
you
yourself
christened
by
the
good
name
of
the
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
cornbutte
said
the
curé
taking
off
his
chasuble
and
stole
i
remember
our
agreement
the
vicar
will
take
my
place
and
i
will
put
myself
at
your
disposal
against
your
dear
son
arrival
and
i
promise
you
that
he
will
not
make
you
fast
long
replied
the
sailor
you
have
already
published
the
banns
and
you
will
only
have
to
absolve
him
from
the
sins
he
may
have
committed
between
sky
and
water
in
the
northern
ocean
i
had
a
good
idea
that
the
marriage
should
be
celebrated
the
very
day
he
arrived
and
that
my
son
louis
should
leave
his
ship
to
repair
at
once
to
the
church
go
then
and
arrange
everything
cornbutte
i
fly
monsieur
the
curé
good
morning
the
sailor
hastened
with
rapid
steps
to
his
house
which
stood
on
the
quay
whence
could
be
seen
the
northern
ocean
of
which
he
seemed
so
proud
jean
cornbutte
had
amassed
a
comfortable
sum
at
his
calling
after
having
long
commanded
the
vessels
of
a
rich
shipowner
of
havre
he
had
settled
down
in
his
native
town
where
he
had
caused
the
brig
to
be
constructed
at
his
own
expense
several
successful
voyages
had
been
made
in
the
north
and
the
ship
always
found
a
good
sale
for
its
cargoes
of
wood
iron
and
tar
jean
cornbutte
then
gave
up
the
command
of
her
to
his
son
louis
a
fine
sailor
of
thirty
who
according
to
all
the
coasting
captains
was
the
boldest
mariner
in
dunkirk
louis
cornbutte
had
gone
away
deeply
attached
to
marie
his
father
niece
who
found
the
time
of
his
absence
very
long
and
weary
marie
was
scarcely
twenty
she
was
a
pretty
flemish
girl
with
some
dutch
blood
in
her
veins
her
mother
when
she
was
dying
had
confided
her
to
her
brother
jean
cornbutte
the
brave
old
sailor
loved
her
as
a
daughter
and
saw
in
her
proposed
union
with
louis
a
source
of
real
and
durable
happiness
the
arrival
of
the
ship
already
signalled
off
the
coast
completed
an
important
business
operation
from
which
jean
cornbutte
expected
large
profits
the
which
had
left
three
months
before
came
last
from
bodoë
on
the
west
coast
of
norway
and
had
made
a
quick
voyage
thence
on
returning
home
jean
cornbutte
found
the
whole
house
alive
marie
with
radiant
face
had
assumed
her
i
hope
the
ship
will
not
arrive
before
we
are
ready
she
said

replied
jean
cornbutte

cornbutte
cried
he
here

the
very
moment

decided
to

a
large
quantity
of
wood
for
the
navy
what
is
that
to
me
replied
jean

marie

replied
clerbaut
but

short

purchase
of
wood

the
wedding
replied
jean
cornbutte
interrupting
the
merchant
and
shaking
his
hand
as
if
he
would
crush
it
this
purchase
of
wood
and
with
all
our
friends

and
seamen
clerbaut
i
have
already
informed
everybody

i
shall

on
the
pier
asked
marie

jean
cornbutte

will
defile

by
two
with
the
violins
at
the
head
jean
cornbutte
invited
guests

though
it
was
very
early
not
a
single
one
failed
to
appear
all
congratulated
the
honest
old
sailor
whom
they
loved
meanwhile
marie
kneeling
down
changed
her
prayers
to
god
into
thanksgivings
she
soon
returned
lovely
and
decked
out
to
the
company
and
all
the
women
kissed
her
on
the
check
while
the
men
vigorously
grasped
her
by
the
hand
then
jean
cornbutte
gave
the
signal
of
departure
it
was
a
curious
sight
to
see
this
joyous
group
taking
its
way
at
sunrise
towards
the
sea
the
news
of
the
ship
arrival
had
spread
through
the
port
and
many
heads
in
nightcaps
appeared
at
the
windows
and
at
the
doors
sincere
compliments
and
pleasant
nods
came
from
every
side

reached
the
pier
in
the
midst
of
a
concert
of
praise
and
blessings
the
weather
was
magnificent
and
the
sun
seemed
to
take
part
in
the
festivity
a
fresh
north
wind
made
the
waves
foam
and
some
their
sails
trimmed
for
leaving
port
streaked
the
sea
with
their
rapid
wakes
between
the
breakwaters

far
out
into
the

the
whole
width
of
the
northern
pier
and
soon
reached
a
small
house
situated
at
its
extremity
inhabited
by

freshened
and
the
ran
swiftly
under
her
topsails
mizzen
brigantine
gallant
and
royal
there
was
evidently
rejoicing
on

as
well
as
on
land
jean
cornbutte
in

responded
merrily
to
the
questions
of
his
friends
see
my
ship
he
cried
clean
and
steady
as
if
she
had
been
rigged
at
dunkirk
not
a
bit
of
damage
done
not
a
rope
wanting
do
you
see
your

the

asked

why

at

why
does
he
run
up
his

asked
clerbaut
i
scarcely

old

he
has
a
reason
for
it
no
doubt
your

said
marie
taking
it
from
him
i
want
to
be
the
first
to
see
him
but
he
is
my
son
mademoiselle
he
has
been
your
son
for
thirty
years
answered
the
young
girl
laughing
and
he
has
only
been
my
betrothed
for
two
the
was
now
entirely
visible
already
the
crew
were
preparing
to
cast
anchor
the
upper
sails
had
been
reefed
the
sailors
who
were
among
the
rigging
might
be
recognized
but
neither
marie
nor
jean
cornbutte
had
yet
been
able
to
wave
their
hands
at
the
captain
of
the

the

cried

there

said
a
third
saluting
the

was
only
three
cables
lengths
from
the
shore
when
a
black
flag
ascended
to
the
gaff
of
the
brigantine
there
was
mourning
on
board
a
shudder
of
terror
seized
the
party
and
the
heart
of
the
young
girl
the
ship
sadly
swayed
into
port
and
an
icy
silence
reigned
on
its
deck
soon
it
had
passed
the
end
of
the
pier
marie
jean
cornbutte
and
all
their
friends
hurried
towards
the
quay
at
which
she
was
to
anchor
and
in
a
moment
found
themselves
on
board
my
son
said
jean
cornbutte
who
could
only
articulate
these
words
the
sailors
with
uncovered
heads
pointed
to
the
mourning
flag
marie
uttered
a
cry
of
anguish
and
fell
into

apprised

of

andré

the

apprised
jean
cornbutte
of
the
dreadful
event
at
the
height
of
the
maëlstrom
on
the
of
april
the
ship
putting
for
the
cape
by
reason
of
bad
weather
and
winds
perceived
signals
of
distress
made
by
a
schooner
to
the
leeward
this
schooner
deprived

its
was
running
towards
the
whirlpool
under
bare
poles
captain
louis
cornbutte
seeing
that
this
vessel
was
hastening
into
imminent
danger
resolved
to
go
on
board
her
despite
the
remonstrances
of
his
crew
he
had
the
lowered
into
the
sea
and
got
into
it
with
the
sailor
courtois
and
the
helmsman
pierre
nouquet
the
crew
watched
them
until
they
disappeared
in
the
fog
night
came
on
the
sea
became
more
and
more
boisterous
the
drawn
by
the
currents
in
those
parts
was
in
danger
of
being
engulfed
by
the
maëlstrom
she
was
obliged
to
fly
before
the
wind
for
several
days
she
hovered
near
the
place
of
the
disaster
but
in
vain
the
the
schooner
captain
louis
and
the
two
sailors
did
not
reappear
andré
vasling
then
called
the
crew
together
took
command
of
the
ship
and
set
sail
for
dunkirk
after
reading
this
dry
narrative
jean
cornbutte
wept
for
a
long
time
and
if
he
had
any
consolation
it
was
the
thought
that
his
son
had
died
in
attempting
to
save
his
then
the
poor
father
left
the
ship
the
sight
of
which
made
him
wretched
and
returned
to
his
desolate
home
the
sad
news
soon
spread
throughout
dunkirk
the
many
friends
of
the
old
sailor
came
to
bring
him
their
cordial
and
sincere
sympathy
then
the
sailors
of
the
gave
a
more
particular
account
of
the
event
and
andré
vasling
told
marie
at
great
length
of
the
devotion
of
her
betrothed
to
the
last
when
he
ceased
weeping
jean
cornbutte
thought
over
the
matter
and
the
next
day
after
the
ship
arrival
when
andre
came
to
see
him
said
are
you
very
sure
andré
that
my
son
has
perished
alas
yes
monsieur
jean
replied
the
mate
and
you
made
all
possible
search
for
him
all
monsieur
cornbutte
but
it
is
unhappily
but
too
certain
that
he
and
the
two
sailors
were
sucked
down
in
the
whirlpool
of
the
maëlstrom
would
you
like
andré
to
keep
the
second
command
of
the
ship
that
will
depend
upon
the
captain
monsieur
cornbutte
i
shall
be
the
captain
replied
the
old
sailor
i
am
going
to
discharge
the
cargo
with
all
speed
make
up
my
crew
and
sail
in
search
of
my
son
your
son
is
dead
said
andré
obstinately
it
is
possible
andre
replied
jean
cornbutte
sharply
but
it
is
also
possible
that
he
saved
himself
i
am
going
to
rummage
all
the
ports
of
norway
whither
he
might
have
been
driven
and
when
i
am
fully
convinced
that
i
shall
never
see
him
again
i
will
return
here
to
die
andré
vasling
seeing
that
this
decision
was
irrevocable
did
not
insist
further
but
went
away
jean
cornbutte
at
once
apprised
his
niece
of
his
intention
and
he
saw
a
few
rays
of
hope
glisten
across
her
tears
it
had
not
seemed
to
the
young
girl
that
her
lover
death
might
be
doubtful
but
scarcely
had
this
new
hope
entered
her
heart
than
she
embraced
it
without
reserve
the
old
sailor
determined
that
the
should
put
to
sea
without
delay
the
solidly
built
ship
had
no
need
of
repairs
jean
cornbutte
gave
his
sailors
notice
that
if
they
wished
to
no
change
in
the
crew
would
be
made
he
alone
replaced
his
son
in
the
command
of
the
brig
none
of
the
comrades
of
louis
cornbutte
failed
to
respond
to
his
call
and
there
were
hardy
tars
among
them
alaine
turquiette
fidèle
misonne
the
carpenter
penellan
the
breton
who
replaced
pierre
nouquet
as
helmsman
and
gradlin
aupic
and
gervique
courageous
and
mariners
jean
cornbutte
again
offered
andré
vasling
his
old
rank
on
board
the
first
mate
was
an
able
officer
who
had
proved
his
skill
in
bringing
the
into
port
yet
from
what
motive
could
not
be
told
andré
made
some
difficulties
and
asked
time
for
reflection
as
you
will
andré
vasling
replied
cornbutte
only
remember
that
if
you
accept
you
will
be
welcome
among
us
jean
had
a
devoted
sailor
in
penellan
the
breton
who
had
long
been
his
in
times
gone
by
little
marie
was
wont
to
pass
the
long
winter
evenings
in
the
helmsman
arms
when
he
was
on
shore
he
felt
a
fatherly
friendship
for
her
and
she
had
for
him
ah
affection
quite
filial
penellan
hastened
the
fitting
out
of
the
ship
with
all
his
energy
all
the
more
because
according
to
his
opinion
andré
vasling
had
not
perhaps
made
every
effort
possible
to
find
the
castaways
although
he
was
excusable
from
the
responsibility
which
weighed
upon
him
as
captain
within
a
week
the
was
ready
to
put
to
sea
instead
of
merchandise
she
was
completely
provided
with
salt
meats
biscuits
barrels
of
flour
potatoes
pork
wine
brandy
coffee
tea
and
tobacco
the
departure
was
fixed
for
the
of
may
on
the
evening
before
andré
vasling
who
had
not
yet
given
his
answer
to
jean
cornbutte
came
to
his
house
he
was
still
undecided
and
did
not
know
which
course
to
take
jean
was
not
at
home
though
the
was
open
andré
went
into
the
passage
next
to
marie
chamber
where
the
sound
of
an
animated
conversation
struck
his
ear
he
listened
attentively
and
recognized
the
voices
of
penellan
and
marie
the
discussion
had
no
doubt
been
going
on
for
some
time
for
the
young
girl
seemed
to
be
stoutly
opposing
what
the
breton
sailor
said
how
old
is
my
uncle
cornbutte
said
marie
something
about
sixty
years
replied
penellan
well
is
he
not
going
to
brave
danger
to
find
his
son
our
captain
is
still
a
sturdy
man
returned
the
sailor
he
has
a
body
of
oak
and
muscles
as
hard
as
a
spare
spar
so
i
am
not
afraid
to
have
him
go
to
sea
again
my
good
penellan
said
marie
one
is
strong
when
one
loves
besides
i
have
full
confidence
in
the
aid
of
heaven
you
understand
me
and
will
help
me
no
said
penellan
it
is
impossible
marie
who
knows
whither
we
shall
drift
or
what
we
must
suffer
how
many
vigorous
men
have
i
seen
lose
their
lives
in
these
seas
penellan
returned
the
young
girl
if
you
refuse
me
i
shall
believe
that
you
do
not
love
me
any
longer
andré
vasling
understood
the
young
girl
resolution
he
reflected
a
moment
and
his
course
was
determined
on
jean
cornbutte
said
he
advancing
towards
the
old
sailor
who
now
entered
i
will
go
with
you
the
cause
of
my
hesitation
has
disappeared
and
you
may
count
upon
my
devotion
i
have
never
doubted
you
andré
vasling
replied
jean
cornbutte
grasping
him
by
the
hand
marie
my
child
he
added
calling
in
a
loud
voice
marie
and
penellan
made
their
appearance
we
shall
set
sail
at
daybreak
with
the
outgoing
tide
said
jean
my
poor
marie
this
is
the
last
evening
that
we
shall
pass
together
uncle
cried
marie
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
marie
by
the
help
of
god
i
will
bring
your
lover
back
to
you
yes
we
will
find
louis
added
andré
vasling
you
are
going
with
us
then
asked
penellan
quickly
yes
penellan
andré
vasling
is
to
be
my
first
mate
answered
jean
oh
oh
ejaculated
the
breton
in
a
singular
tone
and
his
advice
will
be
useful
to
us
for
he
is
able
and
enterprising
and
yourself
captain
said
andré
you
will
set
us
all
a
good
example
for
you
have
still
as
much
vigour
as
experience
well
my
friends
till
go
on
board
and
make
the
final
arrangements
andré
penellan
the
mate
and
the
sailor
went
out
together
and
jean
and
marie
remained
alone
many
bitter
tears
were
shed
during
that
sad
evening
jean
cornbutte
seeing
marie
so
wretched
resolved
to
spare
her
the
pain
of
separation
by
leaving
the
house
on
the
morrow
without
her
knowledge
so
he
gave
her
a
last
kiss
that
evening
and
at
three
next
morning
was
up
and
away
the
departure
of
the
brig
had
attracted
all
the
old
friends
to
the
pier
the
curé
who
was
to
have
blessed
union
with
louis
came
to
give
a
last
benediction
on
the
ship
rough
grasps
of
the
hand
were
silently
exchanged
and
jean
went
on
board
the
crew
were
all
there
andré
vasling
gave
the
last
orders
the
sails
were
spread
and
the
brig
rapidly
passed
out
under
a
stiff
breeze
whilst
the
cure
upright
in
the
midst
of
the
kneeling
spectators
committed
the
vessel
to
the
hands
of
god
whither
goes
this
ship
she
follows
the
perilous
route
upon
which
so
many
castaways
have
been
lost
she
has
no
certain
destination
she
must
expect
every
peril
and
be
able
to
brave
them
without
hesitating
god
alone
knows
where
it
will
be
her
fate
to
anchor
may
god
guide
her

a
ray
of
hope
at
that
time
of
the
year
the
season
was
favourable
and
the
crew
might
hope
promptly
to
reach
the
scene
of
the
shipwreck
jean
cornbutte
plan
was
naturally
traced
out
he
counted
on
stopping
at
the
feroë
islands
whither
the
north
wind
might
have
carried
the
castaways
then
if
he
was
convinced
that
they
had
not
been
received
in
any
of
the
ports
of
that
locality
he
would
continue
his
search
beyond
the
northern
ocean
ransack
the
whole
western
coast
of
norway
as
far
as
bodoë
the
place
nearest
the
scene
of
the
shipwreck
and
if
necessary
farther
still
andré
vasling
thought
contrary
to
the
captain
opinion
that
the
coast
of
iceland
should
be
explored
but
penellan
observed
that
at
the
time
of
the
catastrophe
the
gale
came
from
the
west
which
while
it
gave
hope
that
the
unfortunates
had
not
been
forced
towards
the
gulf
of
the
maëlstrom
gave
ground
for
supposing
that
they
might
have
been
thrown
on
the
norwegian
coast
it
was
determined
then
that
this
coast
should
be
followed
as
closely
as
possible
so
as
to
recognize
any
traces
of
them
that
might
appear
the
day
after
sailing
jean
cornbutte
intent
upon
a
map
was
absorbed
in
reflection
when
a
small
hand
touched
his
shoulder
and
a
soft
voice
said
in
his
ear
have
good
courage
uncle
illustration
a
soft
voice
said
in
his
ear
have
good
courage
uncle
he
turned
and
was
stupefied
marie
embraced
him
marie
my
daughter
on
board
he
cried
the
wife
may
well
go
in
search
of
her
husband
when
the
father
embarks
to
save
his
child
unhappy
marie
how
wilt
thou
support
our
fatigues
dost
thou
know
that
thy
presence
may
be
injurious
to
our
search
no
uncle
for
i
am
strong
who
knows
whither
we
shall
be
forced
to
go
marie
look
at
this
map
we
are
approaching
places
dangerous
even
for
us
sailors
hardened
though
we
are
to
the
difficulties
of
the
sea
and
thou
frail
child
but
uncle
i
come
from
a
family
of
sailors
i
am
used
to
stories
of
combats
and
tempests
i
am
with
you
and
my
old
friend
penellan
penellan
it
was
he
who
concealed
you
on
board
yes
uncle
but
only
when
he
saw
that
i
was
determined
to
come
without
his
help
penellan
cried
jean
penellan
entered
it
is
not
possible
to
undo
what
you
have
done
penellan
but
remember
that
you
are
responsible
for
marie
life
rest
easy
captain
replied
penellan
the
little
one
has
force
and
courage
and
will
be
our
guardian
angel
and
then
captain
you
know
it
is
my
theory
that
all
in
this
world
happens
for
the
best
the
young
girl
was
installed
in
a
cabin
which
the
sailors
soon
got
ready
for
her
and
which
they
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
a
week
later
the
stopped
at
the
feroë
islands
but
the
most
minute
search
was
fruitless
no
wreck
or
fragments
of
a
ship
had
come
upon
these
coasts
even
the
news
of
the
event
was
quite
unknown
the
brig
resumed
its
voyage
after
a
stay
of
ten
days
about
the
of
june
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
winds
were
favourable
the
ship
sped
rapidly
towards
the
norwegian
coast
which
it
explored
without
better
result
jean
cornbutte
determined
to
proceed
to
bodoë
perhaps
he
would
there
learn
the
name
of
the
shipwrecked
schooner
to
succour
which
louis
and
the
sailors
had
sacrificed
themselves
on
the
of
june
the
brig
cast
anchor
in
that
port
the
authorities
of
bodoë
gave
jean
cornbutte
a
bottle
found
on
the
coast
which
contained
a
document
bearing
these
words
this
april
on
board
the
after
being
accosted
by
the
of
the
we
were
drawn
by
the
currents
towards
the
ice
god
have
pity
on
us
jean
cornbutte
first
impulse
was
to
thank
heaven
he
thought
himself
on
his
son
track
the
froöern
was
a
norwegian
sloop
of
which
there
had
been
no
news
but
which
had
evidently
been
drawn
northward
not
a
day
was
to
be
lost
the
was
at
once
put
in
condition
to
brave
the
perils
of
the
polar
seas
fidèle
misonne
the
carpenter
carefully
examined
her
and
assured
himself
that
her
solid
construction
might
resist
the
shock
of
the
penellan
who
had
already
engaged
in
in
the
arctic
waters
took
care
that
woollen
and
fur
coverings
many
sealskin
moccassins
and
wood
for
the
making
of
sledges
with
which
to
cross
the
were
put
on
board
the
amount
of
provisions
was
increased
and
spirits
and
charcoal
were
added
for
it
might
be
that
they
would
have
to
winter
at
some
point
on
the
greenland
coast
they
also
procured
with
much
difficulty
and
at
a
high
price
a
quantity
of
lemons
for
preventing
or
curing
the
scurvy
that
terrible
disease
which
decimates
crews
in
the
icy
regions
the
ship
hold
was
filled
with
salt
meat
biscuits
brandy
as
the
steward
room
no
longer
sufficed
they
provided
themselves
moreover
with
a
large
quantity
of
pemmican
an
indian
preparation
which
concentrates
a
great
deal
of
nutrition
within
a
small
volume
by
order
of
the
captain
some
saws
were
put
on
board
for
cutting
the
as
well
as
picks
and
wedges
for
separating
them
the
captain
determined
to
procure
some
dogs
for
drawing
the
sledges
on
the
greenland
coast
the
whole
crew
was
engaged
in
these
preparations
and
displayed
great
activity
the
sailors
aupic
gervique
and
gradlin
zealously
obeyed
penellan
orders
and
he
admonished
them
not
to
accustom
themselves
to
woollen
garments
though
the
temperature
in
this
latitude
situated
just
beyond
the
polar
circle
was
very
low
penellan
though
he
said
nothing
narrowly
watched
every
action
of
andré
vasling
this
man
was
dutch
by
birth
came
from
no
one
knew
whither
but
was
at
least
a
good
sailor
having
made
two
voyages
on
board
the
penellan
would
not
as
yet
accuse
him
of
anything
unless
it
was
that
he
kept
near
marie
too
constantly
but
he
did
not
let
him
out
of
his
sight
thanks
to
the
energy
of
the
crew
the
brig
was
equipped
by
the
of
july
a
fortnight
after
its
arrival
at
bodoë
it
was
then
the
favourable
season
for
attempting
explorations
in
the
arctic
seas
the
thaw
had
been
going
on
for
two
months
and
the
search
might
be
carried
farther
north
the
set
sail
and
directed
her
way
towards
cape
brewster
on
the
eastern
coast
of
greenland
near
the
degree
of
latitude
chapter
iv
in
the
passes
about
the
of
july
a
reflection
raised
above
the
sea
announced
the
presence
of
the
first
icebergs
which
emerging
from
davis
straits
advanced
into
the
ocean
from
this
moment
a
vigilant
watch
was
ordered
to
the
men
for
it
was
important
not
to
come
into
collision
with
these
enormous
masses
the
crew
was
divided
into
two
watches
the
first
was
composed
of
fidèle
misonne
gradlin
and
gervique
and
the
second
of
andre
vasling
aupic
and
penellan
these
watches
were
to
last
only
two
hours
for
in
those
cold
regions
a
man
strength
is
diminished
though
the
was
not
yet
beyond
the
degree
of
latitude
the
thermometer
already
stood
at
nine
degrees
centigrade
below
zero
rain
and
snow
often
fell
abundantly
on
fair
days
when
the
wind
was
not
too
violent
marie
remained
on
deck
and
her
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
uncouth
scenes
of
the
polar
seas
on
the
of
august
she
was
promenading
aft
and
talking
with
her
uncle
penellan
and
andré
vasling
the
ship
was
then
entering
a
channel
three
miles
wide
across
which
broken
masses
of
ice
were
rapidly
descending
southwards
when
shall
we
see
land
asked
the
young
girl
in
three
or
four
days
at
the
latest
replied
jean
cornbutte
but
shall
we
find
there
fresh
traces
of
my
poor
louis
perhaps
so
my
daughter
but
i
fear
that
we
are
still
far
from
the
end
of
our
voyage
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
was
driven
farther
northward
that
may
be
added
andré
vasling
for
the
squall
which
separated
us
from
the
norwegian
boat
lasted
three
days
and
in
three
days
a
ship
makes
good
headway
when
it
is
no
longer
able
to
resist
the
wind
permit
me
to
tell
you
monsieur
vasling
replied
penellan
that
that
was
in
april
that
the
thaw
had
not
then
begun
and
that
therefore
the
must
have
been
soon
arrested
by
the
ice
and
no
doubt
dashed
into
a
thousand
pieces
said
the
mate
as
her
crew
could
not
manage
her
but
these
returned
penellan
gave
her
an
easy
means
of
reaching
land
from
which
she
could
not
have
been
far
distant
let
us
hope
so
said
jean
cornbutte
interrupting
the
discussion
which
was
daily
renewed
between
the
mate
and
the
helmsman
i
think
we
shall
see
land
before
long
there
it
is
cried
marie
see
those
mountains
no
my
child
replied
her
uncle
those
are
mountains
of
ice
the
first
we
have
met
with
they
would
shatter
us
like
glass
if
we
got
entangled
between
them
penellan
and
vasling
overlook
the
men
these
floating
masses
more
than
fifty
of
which
now
appeared
at
the
horizon
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
brig
penellan
took
the
helm
and
jean
cornbutte
mounted
on
the
gallant
indicated
the
route
to
take
towards
evening
the
brig
was
entirely
surrounded
by
these
moving
rocks
the
crushing
force
of
which
is
irresistible
it
was
necessary
then
to
cross
this
fleet
of
mountains
for
prudence
prompted
them
to
keep
straight
ahead
another
difficulty
was
added
to
these
perils
the
direction
of
the
ship
could
not
be
accurately
determined
as
all
the
surrounding
points
constantly
changed
position
and
thus
failed
to
afford
a
fixed
perspective
the
darkness
soon
increased
with
the
fog
marie
descended
to
her
cabin
and
the
whole
crew
by
the
captain
orders
remained
on
deck
they
were
armed
with
long
with
iron
spikes
to
preserve
the
ship
from
collision
with
the
ice
the
ship
soon
entered
a
strait
so
narrow
that
often
the
ends
of
her
yards
were
grazed
by
the
drifting
mountains
and
her
booms
seemed
about
to
be
driven
in
they
were
even
forced
to
trim
the
mainyard
so
as
to
touch
the
shrouds
happily
these
precautions
did
not
deprive
the
vessel
of
any
of
its
speed
for
the
wind
could
only
reach
the
upper
sails
and
these
sufficed
to
carry
her
forward
rapidly
thanks
to
her
slender
hull
she
passed
through
these
valleys
which
were
filled
with
whirlpools
of
rain
whilst
the
icebergs
crushed
against
each
other
with
sharp
cracking
and
splitting
jean
cornbutte
returned
to
the
deck
his
eyes
could
not
penetrate
the
surrounding
darkness
it
became
necessary
to
furl
the
upper
sails
for
the
ship
threatened
to
ground
and
if
she
did
so
she
was
lost
cursed
voyage
growled
andré
vasling
among
the
sailors
who
forward
were
avoiding
the
most
menacing
with
their
truly
if
we
escape
we
shall
owe
a
fine
candle
to
our
lady
of
the
ice
replied
aupic
who
knows
how
many
floating
mountains
we
have
got
to
pass
through
yet
added
the
mate
and
who
can
guess
what
we
shall
find
beyond
them
replied
the
sailor
do
talk
so
much
prattler
said
gervique
and
look
out
on
your
side
when
we
have
got
by
them
it
be
time
to
grumble
look
out
for
your
at
this
moment
an
enormous
block
of
ice
in
the
narrow
strait
through
which
the
brig
was
passing
came
rapidly
down
upon
her
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
avoid
it
for
it
barred
the
whole
width
of
the
channel
and
the
brig
could
not
do
you
feel
the
tiller
asked
cornbutte
of
penellan
no
captain
the
ship
does
not
answer
the
helm
any
longer
boys
cried
the
captain
to
the
crew
do
be
afraid
and
buttress
your
hooks
against
the
gunwale
the
block
was
nearly
sixty
feet
high
and
if
it
threw
itself
upon
the
brig
she
would
be
crushed
there
was
an
undefinable
moment
of
suspense
and
the
crew
retreated
backward
abandoning
their
posts
despite
the
captain
orders
but
at
the
instant
when
the
block
was
not
more
than
half
a
cable
length
from
the
a
dull
sound
was
heard
and
a
veritable
waterspout
fell
upon
the
bow
of
the
vessel
which
then
rose
on
the
back
of
an
enormous
billow
the
sailors
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
but
when
they
looked
before
them
the
block
had
disappeared
the
passage
was
free
and
beyond
an
immense
plain
of
water
illumined
by
the
rays
of
the
declining
sun
assured
them
of
an
easy
navigation
all
well
cried
penellan
let
trim
our
topsails
and
mizzen
an
incident
very
common
in
those
parts
had
just
occurred
when
these
masses
are
detached
from
one
another
in
the
thawing
season
they
float
in
a
perfect
equilibrium
but
on
reaching
the
ocean
where
the
water
is
relatively
warmer
they
are
speedily
undermined
at
the
base
which
melts
little
by
little
and
which
is
also
shaken
by
the
shock
of
other
a
moment
comes
when
the
centre
of
gravity
of
these
masses
is
displaced
and
then
they
are
completely
overturned
only
if
this
block
had
turned
over
two
minutes
later
it
would
have
fallen
on
the
brig
and
carried
her
down
in
its
fall
chapter
liverpool
island
the
brig
now
sailed
in
a
sea
which
was
almost
entirely
open
at
the
horizon
only
a
whitish
light
this
time
motionless
indicated
the
presence
of
fixed
plains
of
ice
jean
cornbutte
now
directed
the
towards
cape
brewster
they
were
already
approaching
the
regions
where
the
temperature
is
excessively
cold
for
the
sun
rays
owing
to
their
obliquity
when
they
reach
them
are
very
feeble
on
the
of
august
the
brig
confronted
immoveable
and
united
the
passages
were
seldom
more
than
a
cable
length
in
width
and
the
ship
was
forced
to
make
many
turnings
which
sometimes
placed
her
heading
the
wind
penellan
watched
over
marie
with
paternal
care
and
despite
the
cold
prevailed
upon
her
to
spend
two
or
three
hours
every
day
on
deck
for
exercise
had
become
one
of
the
indispensable
conditions
of
health
marie
courage
did
not
falter
she
even
comforted
the
sailors
with
her
cheerful
talk
and
all
of
them
became
warmly
attached
to
her
andré
vasling
showed
himself
more
attentive
than
ever
and
seized
every
occasion
to
be
in
her
company
but
the
young
girl
with
a
sort
of
presentiment
accepted
his
services
with
some
coldness
it
may
be
easily
conjectured
that
andré
conversation
referred
more
to
the
future
than
to
the
present
and
that
he
did
not
conceal
the
slight
probability
there
was
of
saving
the
castaways
he
was
convinced
that
they
were
lost
and
the
young
girl
ought
thenceforth
to
confide
her
existence
to
some
one
else
illustration
andré
vasling
showed
himself
more
attentive
than
ever
marie
had
not
as
yet
comprehended
andré
designs
for
to
his
great
disgust
he
could
never
find
an
opportunity
to
talk
long
with
her
alone
penellan
had
always
an
excuse
for
interfering
and
destroying
the
effect
of
andre
words
by
the
hopeful
opinions
he
expressed
marie
meanwhile
did
not
remain
idle
acting
on
the
advice
she
set
to
work
on
her
winter
garments
for
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
completely
change
her
clothing
the
cut
of
her
dresses
was
not
suitable
for
these
cold
latitudes
she
made
therefore
a
sort
of
furred
pantaloons
the
ends
of
which
were
lined
with
and
her
narrow
skirts
came
only
to
her
knees
so
as
not
to
be
in
contact
with
the
layers
of
snow
with
which
the
winter
would
cover
the
a
fur
mantle
fitting
closely
to
the
figure
and
supplied
with
a
hood
protected
the
upper
part
of
her
body
in
the
intervals
of
their
work
the
sailors
too
prepared
clothing
with
which
to
shelter
themselves
from
the
cold
they
made
a
quantity
of
high
boots
with
which
to
cross
the
snow
during
their
explorations
they
worked
thus
all
the
time
that
the
navigation
in
the
straits
lasted
andré
vasling
who
was
an
excellent
shot
several
times
brought
down
aquatic
birds
with
his
gun
innumerable
flocks
of
these
were
always
careering
about
the
ship
a
kind
of
provided
the
crew
with
very
palatable
food
which
relieved
the
monotony
of
the
salt
meat
at
last
the
brig
after
many
turnings
came
in
sight
of
cape
brewster
a
was
put
to
sea
jean
cornbutte
and
penellan
reached
the
coast
which
was
entirely
deserted
the
ship
at
once
directed
its
course
towards
liverpool
island
discovered
in
by
captain
scoresby
and
the
crew
gave
a
hearty
cheer
when
they
saw
the
natives
running
along
the
shore
communication
was
speedily
established
with
them
thanks
to
penellan
knowledge
of
a
few
words
of
their
language
and
some
phrases
which
the
natives
themselves
had
learnt
of
the
whalers
who
frequented
those
parts
these
greenlanders
were
small
and
squat
they
were
not
more
than
four
feet
ten
inches
high
they
had
red
round
faces
and
low
foreheads
their
hair
flat
and
black
fell
over
their
shoulders
their
teeth
were
decayed
and
they
seemed
to
be
affected
by
the
sort
of
leprosy
which
is
peculiar
to
ichthyophagous
tribes
in
exchange
for
pieces
of
iron
and
brass
of
which
they
are
extremely
covetous
these
poor
creatures
brought
bear
furs
the
skins
of
and
all
the
animals
generally
known
as
seals
jean
cornbutte
obtained
these
at
a
low
price
and
they
were
certain
to
become
most
useful
the
captain
then
made
the
natives
understand
that
he
was
in
search
of
a
shipwrecked
vessel
and
asked
them
if
they
had
heard
of
it
one
of
them
immediately
drew
something
like
a
ship
on
the
snow
and
indicated
that
a
vessel
of
that
sort
had
been
carried
northward
three
months
before
he
also
managed
to
make
it
understood
that
the
thaw
and
breaking
up
of
the
had
prevented
the
greenlanders
from
going
in
search
of
it
and
indeed
their
very
light
canoes
which
they
managed
with
paddles
could
not
go
to
sea
at
that
time
this
news
though
meagre
restored
hope
to
the
hearts
of
the
sailors
and
jean
cornbutte
had
no
difficulty
in
persuading
them
to
advance
farther
in
the
polar
seas
before
quitting
liverpool
island
the
captain
purchased
a
pack
of
six
esquimaux
dogs
which
were
soon
acclimatised
on
board
the
ship
weighed
anchor
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
and
entered
the
northern
straits
under
a
brisk
wind
the
longest
days
of
the
year
had
now
arrived
that
is
the
sun
in
these
high
latitudes
did
not
set
and
reached
the
highest
point
of
the
spirals
which
it
described
above
the
horizon
this
total
absence
of
night
was
not
however
very
apparent
for
the
fog
rain
and
snow
sometimes
enveloped
the
ship
in
real
darkness
jean
cornbutte
who
was
resolved
to
advance
as
far
as
possible
began
to
take
measures
of
health
the
space
between
decks
was
securely
enclosed
and
every
morning
care
was
taken
to
ventilate
it
with
fresh
air
the
stoves
were
installed
and
the
pipes
so
disposed
as
to
yield
as
much
heat
as
possible
the
sailors
were
advised
to
wear
only
one
woollen
shirt
over
their
cotton
shirts
and
to
hermetically
close
their
seal
cloaks
the
fires
were
not
yet
lighted
for
it
was
important
to
reserve
the
wood
and
charcoal
for
the
most
intense
cold
warm
beverages
such
as
coffee
and
tea
were
regularly
distributed
to
the
sailors
morning
and
evening
and
as
it
was
important
to
live
on
meat
they
shot
ducks
and
teal
which
abounded
in
these
parts
jean
cornbutte
also
placed
at
the
summit
of
the
mainmast
a
crow
nest
a
sort
of
cask
staved
in
at
one
end
in
which
a
remained
constantly
to
observe
the
icefields
two
days
after
the
brig
had
lost
sight
of
liverpool
island
the
temperature
became
suddenly
colder
under
the
influence
of
a
dry
wind
some
indications
of
winter
were
perceived
the
ship
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
for
soon
the
way
would
be
entirely
closed
to
her
she
advanced
across
the
straits
among
which
lay
thirty
feet
thick
on
the
morning
of
the
of
september
the
reached
the
head
of
bay
land
was
then
thirty
miles
to

it
was
the
first
time
that
the

had
stopped
before
a

offered
no

which
was
at

a

turquiette
were
chosen
to
work
the

which
had
been
carried
outside
the
ship
the

of
the
cutting
was
so
determined
that
the
current
might
carry
off
the
pieces
detached
from
the
mass
the
whole
crew
worked
at
this
task
for
nearly
twenty
hours
they
found
it
very
painful
to
remain
on
the
ice
and
were
often
obliged
to
plunge
into
the
water
up
to
their
middle
their
garments
protected
them

imperfectly

the
damp
moreover
all
excessive
toil
in

high
latitudes

soon
followed
by
an
overwhelming
weariness
for
the
breath
soon
fails
and
the
strongest
are
forced
to
rest
at
frequent
intervals
at
last
the

became
free

beyond

the

blow
up

of

without

surrounding
the

on

near
the

west
and
the
degree
of
latitude
north
at
the
entrance
of

jean
cornbutte
made
his
preliminary
preparations
for
wintering
he
first
searched
for
a
creek
whose
position
would
shelter
the
ship
from
the
wind
and
breaking
up
of
the
ice
land
which
was
probably
thirty
miles
west
could
alone
offer
him
secure
shelter
and
he
resolved
to
attempt
to
reach
it
he
set
out
on
the
of
september
accompanied
by
andré
vasling
penellan
and
the
two
sailors
gradlin
and
turquiette
each
man
carried
provisions
for
two
days
for
it
was
not
likely
that
their
expedition
would
occupy
a
longer
time
and
they
were
supplied
with
skins
on
which
to
sleep
snow
had
fallen
in
great
abundance
and
was
not
yet
frozen
over
and
this
delayed
them
seriously
they
often
sank
to
their
waists
and
could
only
advance
very
cautiously
for
fear
of
falling
into
crevices
penellan
who
walked
in
front
carefully
sounded
each
depression
with
his
staff
about
five
in
the
evening
the
fog
began
to
thicken
and
the
little
band
were
forced
to
stop
penellan
looked
about
for
an
iceberg
which
might
shelter
them
from
the
wind
and
after
refreshing
themselves
with
regrets
that
they
had
no
warm
drink
they
spread
their
skins
on
the
snow
wrapped
themselves
up
lay
close
to
each
other
and
soon
dropped
asleep
from
sheer
fatigue
the
next
morning
jean
cornbutte
and
his
companions
were
buried
beneath
a
bed
of
snow
more
than
a
foot
deep
happily
their
skins
perfectly
impermeable
had
preserved
them
and
the
snow
itself
had
aided
in
retaining
their
heat
which
it
prevented
from
escaping
the
captain
gave
the
signal
of
departure
and
about
noon
they
at
last
descried
the
coast
which
at
first
they
could
scarcely
distinguish
high
ledges
of
ice
cut
perpendicularly
rose
on
the
shore
their
variegated
summits
of
all
forms
and
shapes
reproduced
on
a
large
scale
the
phenomena
of
crystallization
myriads
of
aquatic
fowl
flew
about
at
the
approach
of
the
party
and
the
seals
lazily
lying
on
the
ice
plunged
hurriedly
into
the
depths
i
faith
said
penellan
we
shall
not
want
for
either
furs
or
game
those
animals
returned
cornbutte
give
every
evidence
of
having
been
already
visited
by
men
for
in
places
totally
uninhabited
they
would
not
be
so
wild
none
but
greenlanders
frequent
these
parts
said
andré
vasling
i
see
no
trace
of
their
passage
however
neither
any
encampment
nor
the
smallest
hut
said
penellan
who
had
climbed
up
a
high
peak
o
captain
he
continued
come
here
i
see
a
point
of
land
which
will
shelter
us
splendidly
from
the
wind
come
along
boys
said
jean
cornbutte
his
companions
followed
him
and
they
soon
rejoined
penellan
the
sailor
had
said
what
was
true
an
elevated
point
of
land
jutted
out
like
a
promontory
and
curving
towards
the
coast
formed
a
little
inlet
of
a
mile
in
width
at
most
some
moving
broken
by
this
point
floated
in
the
midst
and
the
sea
sheltered
from
the
colder
winds
was
not
yet
entirely
frozen
over
this
was
an
excellent
spot
for
wintering
and
it
only
remained
to
get
the
ship
thither
jean
cornbutte
remarked
that
the
neighbouring
was
very
thick
and
it
seemed
very
difficult
to
cut
a
canal
to
bring
the
brig
to
its
destination
some
other
creek
then
must
be
found
it
was
in
vain
that
he
explored
northward
the
coast
remained
steep
and
abrupt
for
a
long
distance
and
beyond
the
point
it
was
directly
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
the
the
circumstance
disconcerted
the
captain
all
the
more
because
andré
vasling
used
strong
arguments
to
show
how
bad
the
situation
was
penellan
in
this
dilemma
found
it
difficult
to
convince
himself
that
all
was
for
the
best
but
one
chance
remained
to
seek
a
shelter
on
the
southern
side
of
the
coast
this
was
to
return
on
their
path
but
hesitation
was
useless
the
little
band
returned
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
ship
as
their
provisions
had
begun
to
run
short
jean
cornbutte
searched
for
some
practicable
passage
or
at
least
some
fissure
by
which
a
canal
might
be
cut
across
the
all
along
the
route
but
in
vain
towards
evening
the
sailors
came
to
the
same
place
where
they
had
encamped
over
night
there
had
been
no
snow
during
the
day
and
they
could
recognize
the
imprint
of
their
bodies
on
the
ice
they
again
disposed
themselves
to
sleep
with
their
furs
penellan
much
disturbed
by
the
bad
success
of
the
expedition
was
sleeping
restlessly
when
at
a
waking
moment
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
dull
rumbling
he
listened
attentively
and
the
rumbling
seemed
so
strange
that
he
nudged
jean
cornbutte
with
his
elbow
what
is
that
said
the
latter
whose
mind
according
to
a
sailor
habit
was
awake
as
soon
as
his
body
listen
captain
the
noise
increased
with
perceptible
violence
it
can
not
be
thunder
in
so
high
a
latitude
said
cornbutte
rising
i
think
we
have
come
across
some
white
bears
replied
penellan
the
devil
we
have
not
seen
any
yet
sooner
or
later
we
must
have
expected
a
visit
from
them
let
us
give
them
a
good
reception
penellan
armed
with
a
gun
lightly
crossed
the
ledge
which
sheltered
them
the
darkness
was
very
dense
he
could
discover
nothing
but
a
new
incident
soon
showed
him
that
the
cause
of
the
noise
did
not
proceed
from
around
them
jean
cornbutte
rejoined
him
and
they
observed
with
terror
that
this
rumbling
which
awakened
their
companions
came
from
beneath
them
a
new
kind
of
peril
menaced
them
to
the
noise
which
resembled
peals
of
thunder
was
added
a
distinct
undulating
motion
of
the
several
of
the
party
lost
their
balance
and
fell

cried
penellan
yes
some
one
responded
turquiette
gradlin
where
are
you
here
i
am
responded
turquiette
shaking
off
the
snow
with
which
he
was
covered
this
way
vasling
cried
cornbutte
to
the
mate
and
gradlin
present
captain
but
we
are
lost
shouted
gradlin
in
fright
no
said
penellan
perhaps
we
are
saved
hardly
had
he
uttered
these
words
when
a
frightful
cracking
noise
was
heard
the
broke
clear
through
and
the
sailors
were
forced
to
cling
to
the
block
which
was
quivering
just
by
them
despite
the
helmsman
words
they
found
themselves
in
a
most
perilous
position
for
an
had
occurred
the
ice
masses
had
just
weighed
anchor
as
the
sailors
say
the
movement
lasted
nearly
two
minutes
and
it
was
to
be
feared
that
the
crevice
would
yawn
at
the
very
feet
of
the
unhappy
sailors
they
anxiously
awaited
daylight
in
the
midst
of
continuous
shocks
for
they
could
not
without
risk
of
death
move
a
step
and
had
to
remain
stretched
out
at
full
length
to
avoid
being
engulfed
illustration
they
found
themselves
in
a
most
perilous
position
for
an
had
occurred
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
a
very
different
aspect
presented
itself
to
their
eyes
the
vast
plain
a
compact
mass
the
evening
before
was
now
separated
in
a
thousand
places
and
the
waves
raised
by
some
submarine
commotion
had
broken
the
thick
layer
which
sheltered
them
the
thought
of
his
ship
occurred
to
jean
cornbutte
mind
my
poor
brig
he
cried
it
must
have
perished
the
deepest
despair
began
to
overcast
the
faces
of
his
companions
the
loss
of
the
ship
inevitably
preceded
their
own
deaths
courage
friends
said
penellan
reflect
that
this
disaster
has
opened
us
a
path
across
the
ice
which
will
enable
us
to
bring
our
ship
to
the
bay
for
wintering
and
stop
i
am
not
mistaken
there
is
the
a
mile
nearer
to
us
all
hurried
forward
and
so
imprudently
that
turquiette
slipped
into
a
fissure
and
would
have
certainly
perished
had
not
jean
cornbutte
seized
him
by
his
hood
he
got
off
with
a
rather
cold
bath
the
brig
was
indeed
floating
two
miles
away
after
infinite
trouble
the
little
band
reached
her
she
was
in
good
condition
but
her
rudder
which
they
had
neglected
to
lift
had
been
broken
by

chapter

settling
for
the
winter
penellan
was
once
more
right
all
was
for
the
best
and
this
had
opened
a
practicable
channel
for
the
ship
to
the
bay
the
sailors
had
only
to
make
skilful
use
of
the
currents
to
conduct
her
thither
on
the
of
september
the
brig
was
at
last
moored
in
her
bay
for
wintering
two
cables
lengths
from
the
shore
securely
anchored
on
a
good
bottom
the
ice
began
the
next
day
to
form
around
her
hull
it
soon
became
strong
enough
to
bear
a
weight
and
they
could
establish
a
communication
with
land
the
rigging
as
is
customary
in
arctic
navigation
remained
as
it
was
the
sails
were
carefully
furled
on
the
yards
and
covered
with
their
casings
and
the
remained
in
place
as
much
to
enable
them
to
make
distant
observations
as
to
attract
attention
to
the
ship
the
sun
now
scarcely
rose
above
the
horizon
since
the
june
solstice
the
spirals
which
it
had
described
descended
lower
and
lower
and
it
would
soon
disappear
altogether
the
crew
hastened
to
make
the
necessary
preparations
penellan
supervised
the
whole
the
ice
was
soon
thick
around
the
ship
and
it
was
to
be
feared
that
its
pressure
might
become
dangerous
but
penellan
waited
until
by
reason
of
the
going
and
coming
of
the
floating
and
their
adherence
it
had
reached
a
thickness
of
twenty
feet
he
then
had
it
cut
around
the
hull
so
that
it
united
under
the
ship
the
form
of
which
it
assumed
thus
enclosed
in
a
mould
the
brig
had
no
longer
to
fear
the
pressure
of
the
ice
which
could
make
no
movement
the
sailors
then
elevated
along
the
wales
to
the
height
of
the
nettings
a
snow
wall
five
or
six
feet
thick
which
soon
froze
as
hard
as
a
rock
this
envelope
did
not
allow
the
interior
heat
to
escape
outside
a
canvas
tent
covered
with
skins
and
hermetically
closed
was
stretched
aver
the
whole
length
of
the
deck
and
formed
a
sort
of
walk
for
the
sailors
they
also
constructed
on
the
ice
a
storehouse
of
snow
in
which
articles
which
embarrassed
the
ship
were
stowed
away
the
partitions
of
the
cabins
were
taken
down
so
as
to
form
a
single
vast
apartment
forward
as
well
as
aft
this
single
room
besides
was
more
easy
to
warm
as
the
ice
and
damp
found
fewer
corners
in
which
to
take
refuge
it
was
also
less
difficult
to
ventilate
it
by
means
of
canvas
funnels
which
opened
without
each
sailor
exerted
great
energy
in
these
preparations
and
about
the
of
september
they
were
completed
andré
vasling
had
not
shown
himself
the
least
active
in
this
task
he
devoted
himself
with
especial
zeal
to
the
young
girl
comfort
and
if
she
absorbed
in
thoughts
of
her
poor
louis
did
not
perceive
this
jean
cornbutte
did
not
fail
soon
to
remark
it
he
spoke
of
it
to
penellan
he
recalled
several
incidents
which
completely
enlightened
him
regarding
his
mate
intentions
andré
vasling
loved
marie
and
reckoned
on
asking
her
uncle
for
her
hand
as
soon
as
it
was
proved
beyond
doubt
that
the
castaways
were
irrevocably
lost
they
would
return
then
to
dunkirk
and
andré
vasling
would
be
well
satisfied
to
wed
a
rich
and
pretty
girl
who
would
then
be
the
sole
heiress
of
jean
cornbutte
but
andré
in
his
impatience
was
often
imprudent
he
had
several
times
declared
that
the
search
for
the
castaways
was
useless
when
some
new
trace
contradicted
him
and
enabled
penellan
to
exult
over
him
the
mate
therefore
cordially
detested
the
helmsman
who
returned
his
dislike
heartily
penellan
only
feared
that
andré
might
sow
seeds
of
dissension
among
the
crew
and
persuaded
jean
cornbutte
to
answer
him
evasively
on
the
first
occasion
when
the
preparations
for
the
winter
were
completed
the
captain
took
measures
to
preserve
the
health
of
the
crew
every
morning
the
men
were
ordered
to
air
their
berths
and
carefully
clean
the
interior
walls
to
get
rid
of
the
night
dampness
they
received
boiling
tea
or
coffee
which
are
excellent
cordials
to
use
against
the
cold
morning
and
evening
then
they
were
divided
into
who
should
procure
as
much
fresh
nourishment
as
possible
for
every
day
each
one
also
took
healthy
exercise
every
day
so
as
not
to
expose
himself
without
motion
to
the
cold
for
in
a
temperature
thirty
degrees
below
zero
some
part
of
the
body
might
suddenly
become
frozen
in
such
cases
friction
of
the
snow
was
used
which
alone
could
heal
the
affected
part
penellan
also
strongly
advised
cold
ablutions
every
morning
it
required
some
courage
to
plunge
the
hands
and
face
in
the
snow
which
had
to
be
melted
within
but
penellan
bravely
set
the
example
and
marie
was
not
the
last
to
imitate
him
jean
cornbutte
did
not
forget
to
have
readings
and
prayers
for
it
was
needful
that
the
hearts
of
his
comrades
should
not
give
way
to
despair
or
weariness
nothing
is
more
dangerous
in
these
desolate
latitudes
the
sky
always
gloomy
filled
the
soul
with
sadness
a
thick
snow
lashed
by
violent
winds
added
to
the
horrors
of
their
situation
the
sun
would
soon
altogether
disappear
had
the
clouds
not
gathered
in
masses
above
their
heads
they
might
have
enjoyed
the
moonlight
which
was
about
to
become
really
their
sun
during
the
long
polar
night
but
with
the
west
winds
the
snow
did
not
cease
to
fall
every
morning
it
was
necessary
to
clear
off
the
sides
of
the
ship
and
to
cut
a
new
stairway
in
the
ice
to
enable
them
to
reach
the
they
easily
succeeded
in
doing
this
with
the
steps
once
cut
a
little
water
was
thrown
over
them
and
they
at
once
hardened
penellan
had
a
hole
cut
in
the
ice
not
far
from
the
ship
every
day
the
new
crust
which
formed
over
its
top
was
broken
and
the
water
which
was
drawn
thence
from
a
certain
depth
was
less
cold
than
that
at
the
surface
all
these
preparations
occupied
about
three
weeks
it
was
then
time
to
go
forward
with
the
search
the
ship
was
imprisoned
for
six
or
seven
months
and
only
the
next
thaw
could
open
a
new
route
across
the
ice
it
was
wise
then
to
profit
by
this
delay
and
extend
their
explorations
northward

cornbutte
held
a
council
to
settle
the
plan
of
his
operations
to
which
that
there
might
be
union
zeal
and
courage
on
the
part
of
every
one
he
admitted
the
whole
crew
map
in
hand
he
clearly
explained
their
situation
illustration
map
in
hand
he
clearly
explained
their
situation
the
eastern
coast
of
greenland
advances
perpendicularly
northward
the
discoveries
of
the
navigators
have
given
the
exact
boundaries
of
those
parts
in
the
extent
of
five
hundred
leagues
which
separates
greenland
from
spitzbergen
no
land
has
been
found
an
island
shannon
island
lay
a
hundred
miles
north
of
bay
where
the
was
wintering
if
the
norwegian
schooner
as
was
most
probable
had
been
driven
in
this
direction
supposing
that
she
could
not
reach
shannon
island
it
was
here
that
louis
cornbutte
and
his
comrades
must
have
sought
for
a
winter
asylum
this
opinion
prevailed
despite
andré
vasling
opposition
and
it
was
decided
to
direct
the
explorations
on
the
side
towards
shannon
island
arrangements
for
this
were
at
once
begun
a
sledge
like
that
used
by
the
esquimaux
had
been
procured
on
the
norwegian
coast
this
was
constructed
of
planks
curved
before
and
behind
and
was
made
to
slide
over
the
snow
and
ice
it
was
twelve
feet
long
and
four
wide
and
could
therefore
carry
provisions
if
need
were
for
several
weeks
fidèle
misonne
soon
put
it
in
order
working
upon
it
in
the
snow
storehouse
whither
his
tools
had
been
carried
for
the
first
time
a
was
set
up
in
this
storehouse
without
which
all
labour
there
would
have
been
impossible
the
pipe
was
carried
out
through
one
of
the
lateral
walls
by
a
hole
pierced
in
the
snow
but
a
grave
inconvenience
resulted
from
this
for
the
heat
of
the
stove
little
by
little
melted
the
snow
where
it
came
in
contact
with
it
and
the
opening
visibly
increased
jean
cornbutte
contrived
to
surround
this
part
of
the
pipe
with
some
metallic
canvas
which
is
impermeable
by
heat
this
succeeded
completely
while
misonne
was
at
work
upon
the
sledge
penellan
aided
by
marie
was
preparing
the
clothing
necessary
for
the
expedition
boots
they
had
fortunately
in
plenty
jean
cornbutte
and
andré
vasling
occupied
themselves
with
the
provisions
they
chose
a
small
barrel
of
for
heating
a
portable
reserves
of
coffee
and
tea
in
ample
quantity
were
packed
a
small
box
of
biscuits
two
hundred
pounds
of
pemmican
and
some
gourds
of
brandy
completed
the
stock
of
viands
the
guns
would
bring
down
some
fresh
game
every
day
a
quantity
of
powder
was
divided
between
several
bags
the
compass
sextant
and
were
put
carefully
out
of
the
way
of
injury
on
the
of
october
the
sun
no
longer
appeared
above
the
horizon
they
were
obliged
to
keep
a
lighted
lamp
in
the
lodgings
of
the
crew
all
the
time
there
was
no
time
to
lose
the
explorations
must
be
begun
for
this
reason
in
the
month
of
january
it
would
become
so
cold
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
venture
out
without
peril
of
life
for
two
months
at
least
the
crew
would
be
condemned
to
the
most
complete
imprisonment
then
the
thaw
would
begin
and
continue
till
the
time
when
the
ship
should
quit
the
ice
this
thaw
would
of
course
prevent
any
explorations
on
the
other
hand
if
louis
cornbutte
and
his
comrades
were
still
in
existence
it
was
not
probable
that
they
would
be
able
to
resist
the
severities
of
the
arctic
winter
they
must
therefore
be
saved
beforehand
or
all
hope
would
be
lost
andré
vasling
knew
all
this
better
than
any
one
he
therefore
resolved
to
put
every
possible
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
expedition
the
preparations
for
the
journey
were
completed
about
the
of
october
it
remained
to
select
the
men
who
should
compose
the
party
the
young
girl
could
not
be
deprived
of
the
protection
of
jean
cornbutte
or
of
penellan
neither
of
these
could
on
the
other
hand
be
spared
from
the
expedition
the
question
then
was
whether
marie
could
bear
the
fatigues
of
such
a
journey
she
had
already
passed
through
rough
experiences
without
seeming
to
suffer
from
them
for
she
was
a
daughter
used
from
infancy
to
the
fatigues
of
the
sea
and
even
penellan
was
not
dismayed
to
see
her
struggling
in
the
midst
of
this
severe
climate
against
the
dangers
of
the
polar
seas
it
was
decided
therefore
after
a
long
discussion
that
she
should
go
with
them
and
that
a
place
should
be
reserved
for
her
at
need
on
the
sledge
on
which
a
little
wooden
hut
was
constructed
closed
in
hermetically
as
for
marie
she
was
delighted
for
she
dreaded
to
be
left
alone
without
her
two
protectors
the
expedition
was
thus
formed
marie
jean
cornbutte
penellan
andré
vasling
aupic
and
fidèle
misonne
were
to
go
alaine
turquiette
remained
in
charge
of
the
brig
and
gervique
and
gradlin
stayed
behind
with
him
new
provisions
of
all
kinds
were
carried
for
jean
cornbutte
in
order
to
carry
the
exploration
as
far
as
possible
had
resolved
to
establish
depôts
along
the
route
at
each
seven
or
eight
days
march
when
the
sledge
was
ready
it
was
at
once
fitted
up
and
covered
with
a
skin
tent
the
whole
weighed
some
seven
hundred
pounds
which
a
pack
of
five
dogs
might
easily
carry
over
the
ice
on
the
of
october
as
the
captain
had
foretold
a
sudden
change
took
place
in
the
temperature
the
sky
cleared
the
stars
emitted
an
extraordinary
light
and
the
moon
shone
above
the
horizon
no
longer
to
leave
the
heavens
for
a
fortnight
the
thermometer
descended
to
degrees
below
zero
the
departure
was
fixed
for
the
following
day
chapter
ix
the
house
of
snow
on
the
of
october
at
eleven
in
the
morning
in
a
fine
moonlight
the
caravan
set
out
precautions
were
this
time
taken
that
the
journey
might
be
a
long
one
if
necessary
jean
cornbutte
followed
the
coast
and
ascended
northward
the
steps
of
the
travellers
made
no
impression
on
the
hard
ice
jean
was
forced
to
guide
himself
by
points
which
he
selected
at
a
distance
sometimes
he
fixed
upon
a
hill
bristling
with
peaks
sometimes
on
a
vast
iceberg
which
pressure
had
raised
above
the
plain
illustration
the
caravan
set
out
at
the
first
halt
after
going
fifteen
miles
penellan
prepared
to
encamp
the
tent
was
erected
against
an
marie
had
not
suffered
seriously
with
the
extreme
cold
for
luckily
the
breeze
had
subsided
and
was
much
more
bearable
but
the
young
girl
had
several
times
been
obliged
to
descend
from
her
sledge
to
avert
numbness
from
impeding
the
circulation
of
her
blood
otherwise
her
little
hut
hung
with
skins
afforded
her
all
the
comfort
possible
under
the
circumstances
when
night
or
rather
came
the
little
hut
was
carried
under
the
tent
where
it
served
as
a
for
marie
the
evening
repast
was
composed
of
fresh
meat
pemmican
and
hot
tea
jean
cornbutte
to
avert
danger
of
the
scurvy
distributed
to
each
of
the
party
a
few
drops
of
then
all
slept
under
god
protection
after
eight
hours
of
repose
they
got
ready
to
resume
their
march
a
substantial
breakfast
was
provided
to
the
men
and
the
dogs
then
they
set
out
the
ice
exceedingly
compact
enabled
these
animals
to
draw
the
sledge
easily
the
party
sometimes
found
it
difficult
to
keep
up
with
them
but
the
sailors
soon
began
to
suffer
one
discomfort
that
of
being
dazzled
ophthalmia
betrayed
itself
in
aupic
and
misonne
the
moon
light
striking
on
these
vast
white
plains
burnt
the
eyesight
and
gave
the
eyes
insupportable
pain
there
was
thus
produced
a
very
singular
effect
of
refraction
as
they
walked
when
they
thought
they
were
about
to
put
foot
on
a
hillock
they
stepped
down
lower
which
often
occasioned
falls
happily
so
little
serious
that
penellan
made
them
occasions
for
bantering
still
he
told
them
never
to
take
a
step
without
sounding
the
ground
with
the
ferruled
staff
with
which
each
was
equipped
about
the
of
november
ten
days
after
they
had
set
out
the
caravan
had
gone
fifty
leagues
to
the
northward
weariness
pressed
heavily
on
all
jean
cornbutte
was
painfully
dazzled
and
his
sight
sensibly
changed
aupic
and
misonne
had
to
feel
their
way
for
their
eyes
rimmed
with
red
seemed
burnt
by
the
white
reflection
marie
had
been
preserved
from
this
misfortune
by
remaining
within
her
hut
to
which
she
confined
herself
as
much
as
possible
penellan
sustained
by
an
indomitable
courage
resisted
all
fatigue
but
it
was
andré
vasling
who
bore
himself
best
and
upon
whom
the
cold
and
dazzling
seemed
to
produce
no
effect
his
iron
frame
was
equal
to
every
hardship
and
he
was
secretly
pleased
to
see
the
most
robust
of
his
companions
becoming
discouraged
and
already
foresaw
the
moment
when
they
would
be
forced
to
retreat
to
the
ship
again
on
the
of
november
it
became
absolutely
necessary
to
halt
for
a
day
or
two
as
soon
as
the
place
for
the
encampment
had
been
selected
they
proceeded
to
arrange
it
it
was
determined
to
erect
a
house
of
snow
which
should
be
supported
against
one
of
the
rocks
of
the
promontory
misonne
at
once
marked
out
the
foundations
which
measured
fifteen
feet
long
by
five
wide
penellan
aupic
and
misonne
by
aid
of
their
knives
cut
out
great
blocks
of
ice
which
they
carried
to
the
chosen
spot
and
set
up
as
masons
would
have
built
stone
walls
the
sides
of
the
foundation
were
soon
raised
to
a
height
and
thickness
of
about
five
feet
for
the
materials
were
abundant
and
the
structure
was
intended
to
be
sufficiently
solid
to
last
several
days
the
four
walls
were
completed
in
eight
hours
an
opening
had
been
left
on
the
southern
side
and
the
canvas
of
the
tent
placed
on
these
four
walls
fell
over
the
opening
and
sheltered
it
it
only
remained
to
cover
the
whole
with
large
blocks
to
form
the
roof
of
this
temporary
structure
after
three
more
hours
of
hard
work
the
house
was
done
and
they
all
went
into
it
overcome
with
weariness
and
discouragement
jean
cornbutte
suffered
so
much
that
he
could
not
walk
and
andré
vasling
so
skilfully
aggravated
his
gloomy
feelings
that
he
forced
from
him
a
promise
not
to
pursue
his
search
farther
in
those
frightful
solitudes
penellan
did
not
know
which
saint
to
invoke
he
thought
it
unworthy
and
craven
to
give
up
his
companions
for
reasons
which
had
little
weight
and
tried
to
upset
them
but
in
vain
meanwhile
though
it
had
been
decided
to
return
rest
had
become
so
necessary
that
for
three
days
no
preparations
for
departure
were
made
on
the
of
november
jean
cornbutte
began
to
bury
on
a
point
of
the
coast
the
provisions
for
which
there
was
no
use
a
stake
indicated
the
place
of
the
deposit
in
the
improbable
event
that
new
explorations
should
be
made
in
that
direction
every
day
since
they
had
set
out
similar
deposits
had
been
made
so
that
they
were
assured
of
ample
sustenance
on
the
return
without
the
trouble
of
carrying
them
on
the
sledge
the
departure
was
fixed
for
ten
in
the
morning
on
the
the
most
profound
sadness
filled
the
little
band
marie
with
difficulty
restrained
her
tears
when
she
saw
her
uncle
so
completely
discouraged
so
many
useless
sufferings
so
much
labour
lost
penellan
himself
became
ferocious
in
his
he
consigned
everybody
to
the
nether
regions
and
did
not
cease
to
wax
angry
at
the
weakness
and
cowardice
of
his
comrades
who
were
more
timid
and
tired
he
said
than
marie
who
would
have
gone
to
the
end
of
the
world
without
complaint
andré
vasling
could
not
disguise
the
pleasure
which
this
decision
gave
him
he
showed
himself
more
attentive
than
ever
to
the
young
girl
to
whom
he
even
held
out
hopes
that
a
new
search
should
be
made
when
the
winter
was
over
knowing
well
that
it
would
then
be
too
late
chapter
x
buried
alive
the
evening
before
the
departure
just
as
they
were
about
to
take
supper
penellan
was
breaking
up
some
empty
casks
for
firewood
when
he
was
suddenly
suffocated
by
a
thick
smoke
at
the
same
instant
the
was
shaken
as
if
by
an
earthquake
the
party
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
and
penellan
hurried
outside
it
was
entirely
dark
a
frightful
tempest
for
it
was
not
a
thaw
was
raging
whirlwinds
of
snow
careered
around
and
it
was
so
exceedingly
cold
that
the
helmsman
felt
his
hands
rapidly
freezing
he
was
obliged
to
go
in
again
after
rubbing
himself
violently
with
snow
it
is
a
tempest
said
he
may
heaven
grant
that
our
house
may
withstand
it
for
if
the
storm
should
destroy
it
we
should
be
lost
at
the
same
time
with
the
gusts
of
wind
a
noise
was
heard
beneath
the
frozen
soil
icebergs
broken
from
the
promontory
dashed
away
noisily
and
fell
upon
one
another
the
wind
blew
with
such
violence
that
it
seemed
sometimes
as
if
the
whole
house
moved
from
its
foundation
phosphorescent
lights
inexplicable
in
that
latitude
flashed
across
the
whirlwinds
of
the
snow
marie
marie
cried
penellan
seizing
the
young
girl
hands
we
are
in
a
bad
case
said
misonne
and
i
know
not
whether
we
shall
escape
replied
aupic
let
us
quit
this
said
andré
vasling
impossible
returned
penellan
the
cold
outside
is
terrible
perhaps
we
can
bear
it
by
staying
here
give
me
the
thermometer
demanded
vasling
aupic
handed
it
to
him
it
showed
ten
degrees
below
zero
inside
the
house
though
the
fire
was
lighted
vasling
raised
the
canvas
which
covered
the
opening
and
pushed
it
aside
hastily
for
he
would
have
been
lacerated
by
the
fall
of
ice
which
the
wind
hurled
around
and
which
fell
in
a
perfect
well
vasling
said
penellan
will
you
go
out
then
you
see
that
we
are
more
safe
here
yes
said
jean
cornbutte
and
we
must
use
every
effort
to
strengthen
the
house
in
the
interior
but
a
still
more
terrible
danger
menaces
us
said
vasling
what
asked
jean
the
wind
is
breaking
the
ice
against
which
we
are
propped
just
as
it
has
that
of
the
promontory
and
we
shall
be
either
driven
out
or
buried
that
seems
doubtful
said
penellan
for
it
is
freezing
hard
enough
to
ice
over
all
liquid
surfaces
let
us
see
what
the
temperature
is
he
raised
the
canvas
so
as
to
pass
out
his
arm
and
with
difficulty
found
the
thermometer
again
in
the
midst
of
the
snow
but
he
at
last
succeeded
in
seizing
it
and
holding
the
lamp
to
it
said
degrees
below
zero
it
is
the
coldest
we
have
seen
here
yet
illustration
degrees
below
zero
ten
degrees
more
said
vasling
and
the
mercury
will
freeze
a
mournful
silence
followed
this
remark
about
eight
in
the
morning
penellan
essayed
a
second
time
to
go
out
to
judge
of
their
situation
it
was
necessary
to
give
an
escape
to
the
smoke
which
the
wind
had
several
times
repelled
into
the
hut
the
sailor
wrapped
his
cloak
tightly
about
him
made
sure
of
his
hood
by
fastening
it
to
his
head
with
a
handkerchief
and
raised
the
canvas
the
opening
was
entirely
obstructed
by
a
resisting
snow
penellan
took
his
staff
and
succeeded
in
plunging
it
into
the
compact
mass
but
terror
froze
his
blood
when
he
perceived
that
the
end
of
the
staff
was
not
free
and
was
checked
by
a
hard
body
cornbutte
said
he
to
the
captain
who
had
come
up
to
him
we
are
buried
under
this
snow
what
say
you
cried
jean
cornbutte
i
say
that
the
snow
is
massed
and
frozen
around
us
and
over
us
and
that
we
are
buried
alive
let
us
try
to
clear
this
mass
of
snow
away
replied
the
captain
the
two
friends
buttressed
themselves
against
the
obstacle
which
obstructed
the
opening
but
they
could
not
move
it
the
snow
formed
an
iceberg
more
than
five
feet
thick
and
had
become
literally
a
part
of
the
house
jean
could
not
suppress
a
cry
which
awoke
misonne
and
vasling
an
oath
burst
from
the
latter
whose
features
contracted
at
this
moment
the
smoke
thicker
than
ever
poured
into
the
house
for
it
could
not
find
an
issue
malediction
cried
misonne
the
pipe
of
the
stove
is
sealed
up
by
the
ice
penellan
resumed
his
staff
and
took
down
the
pipe
after
throwing
snow
on
the
embers
to
extinguish
them
which
produced
such
a
smoke
that
the
light
of
the
lamp
could
scarcely
be
seen
then
he
tried
with
his
staff
to
clear
out
the
orifice
but
he
only
encountered
a
rock
of
ice
a
frightful
end
preceded
by
a
terrible
agony
seemed
to
be
their
doom
the
smoke
penetrating
the
throats
of
the
unfortunate
party
caused
an
insufferable
pain
and
air
would
soon
fail
them
altogether
marie
here
rose
and
her
presence
which
inspired
cornbutte
with
despair
imparted
some
courage
to
penellan
he
said
to
himself
that
it
could
not
be
that
the
poor
girl
was
destined
to
so
horrible
a
death
ah
said
she
you
have
made
too
much
fire
the
room
is
full
of
smoke
yes
yes
stammered
penellan
it
is
evident
resumed
marie
for
it
is
not
cold
and
it
is
long
since
we
have
felt
too
much
heat
no
one
dared
to
tell
her
the
truth
see
marie
said
penellan
bluntly
help
us
get
breakfast
ready
it
is
too
cold
to
go
out
here
is
the
the
spirit
and
the
coffee
come
you
others
a
little
pemmican
first
as
this
wretched
storm
forbids
us
from
hunting
these
words
stirred
up
his
comrades
let
us
first
eat
added
penellan
and
then
we
shall
see
about
getting
off
penellan
set
the
example
and
devoured
his
share
of
the
breakfast
his
comrades
imitated
him
and
then
drank
a
cup
of
boiling
coffee
which
somewhat
restored
their
spirits
then
jean
cornbutte
decided
energetically
that
they
should
at
once
set
about
devising
means
of
safety
andré
vasling
now
said
if
the
storm
is
still
raging
which
is
probable
we
must
be
buried
ten
feet
under
the
ice
for
we
can
hear
no
noise
outside
penellan
looked
at
marie
who
now
understood
the
truth
and
did
not
tremble
the
helmsman
first
heated
by
the
flame
of
the
spirit
the
iron
point
of
his
staff
and
successfully
introduced
it
into
the
four
walls
of
ice
but
he
could
find
no
issue
in
either
cornbutte
then
resolved
to
cut
out
an
opening
in
the
door
itself
the
ice
was
so
hard
that
it
was
difficult
for
the
knives
to
make
the
least
impression
on
it
the
pieces
which
were
cut
off
soon
encumbered
the
hut
after
working
hard
for
two
hours
they
had
only
hollowed
out
a
space
three
feet
deep
some
more
rapid
method
and
one
which
was
less
likely
to
demolish
the
house
must
be
thought
of
for
the
farther
they
advanced
the
more
violent
became
the
effort
to
break
off
the
compact
ice
it
occurred
to
penellan
to
make
use
of
the
to
melt
the
ice
in
the
direction
they
wanted
it
was
a
hazardous
method
for
if
their
imprisonment
lasted
long
the
spirit
of
which
they
had
but
little
would
be
wanting
when
needed
to
prepare
the
meals
nevertheless
the
idea
was
welcomed
on
all
hands
and
was
put
in
execution
they
first
cut
a
hole
three
feet
deep
by
one
in
diameter
to
receive
the
water
which
would
result
from
the
melting
of
the
ice
and
it
was
well
that
they
took
this
precaution
for
the
water
soon
dripped
under
the
action
of
the
flames
which
penellan
moved
about
under
the
mass
of
ice
the
opening
widened
little
by
little
but
this
kind
of
work
could
not
be
continued
long
for
the
water
covering
their
clothes
penetrated
to
their
bodies
here
and
there
penellan
was
obliged
to
pause
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
to
withdraw
the
in
order
to
dry
himself
misonne
then
took
his
place
and
worked
sturdily
at
the
task
in
two
hours
though
the
opening
was
five
feet
deep
the
points
of
the
staffs
could
not
yet
find
an
issue
without
it
is
not
possible
said
jean
cornbutte
that
snow
could
have
fallen
in
such
abundance
it
must
have
been
gathered
on
this
point
by
the
wind
perhaps
we
had
better
think
of
escaping
in
some
other
direction
i
do
know
replied
penellan
but
if
it
were
only
for
the
sake
of
not
discouraging
our
comrades
we
ought
to
continue
to
pierce
the
wall
where
we
have
begun
we
must
find
an
issue
ere
long
will
not
the
spirit
fail
us
asked
the
captain
i
hope
not
but
let
us
if
necessary
dispense
with
coffee
and
hot
drinks
besides
that
is
not
what
most
alarms
me
what
is
it
then
penellan
our
lamp
is
going
out
for
want
of
oil
and
we
are
fast
exhausting
our
at
last
thank
god
penellan
went
to
replace
andré
vasling
who
was
vigorously
working
for
the
common
deliverance
monsieur
vasling
said
he
i
am
going
to
take
your
place
but
look
out
well
i
beg
of
you
for
every
tendency
of
the
house
to
fall
so
that
we
may
have
time
to
prevent
it
the
time
for
rest
had
come
and
when
penellan
had
added
one
more
foot
to
the
opening
he
lay
down
beside
his
comrades
chapter
xi
a
cloud
of
smoke
the
next
day
when
the
sailors
awoke
they
were
surrounded
by
complete
darkness
the
lamp
had
gone
out
jean
cornbutte
roused
penellan
to
ask
him
for
the
which
was
passed
to
him
penellan
rose
to
light
the
fire
but
in
getting
up
his
head
struck
against
the
ice
ceiling
he
was
horrified
for
on
the
evening
before
he
could
still
stand
upright
the
being
lighted
up
by
the
dim
rays
of
the
spirit
he
perceived
that
the
ceiling
was
a
foot
lower
than
before
penellan
resumed
work
with
desperation
at
this
moment
the
young
girl
observed
by
the
light
which
the
cast
upon
penellan
face
that
despair
and
determination
were
struggling
in
his
rough
features
for
the
mastery
she
went
to
him
took
his
hands
and
tenderly
pressed
them
illustration
despair
and
determination
were
struggling
in
his
rough
features
for
the
mastery
she
can
not
must
not
die
thus
he
cried
he
took
his
and
once
more
attacked
the
narrow
opening
he
plunged
in
his
staff
and
felt
no
resistance
had
he
reached
the
soft
layers
of
the
snow
he
drew
out
his
staff
and
a
bright
ray
penetrated
to
the
house
of
ice
here
my
friends
he
shouted
he
pushed
back
the
snow
with
his
hands
and
feet
but
the
exterior
surface
was
not
thawed
as
he
had
thought
with
the
ray
of
light
a
violent
cold
entered
the
cabin
and
seized
upon
everything
moist
to
freeze
it
in
an
instant
penellan
enlarged
the
opening
with
his
cutlass
and
at
last
was
able
to
breathe
the
free
air
he
fell
on
his
knees
to
thank
god
and
was
soon
joined
by
marie
and
his
comrades
a
magnificent
moon
lit
up
the
sky
but
the
cold
was
so
extreme
that
they
could
not
bear
it
they
their
retreat
but
penellan
first
looked
about
him
the
promontory
was
no
longer
there
and
the
hut
was
now
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
plain
of
ice
penellan
thought
he
would
go
to
the
sledge
where
the
provisions
were
the
sledge
had
disappeared
the
cold
forced
him
to
return
he
said
nothing
to
his
companions
it
was
necessary
before
all
to
dry
their
clothing
which
was
done
with
the
the
thermometer
held
for
an
instant
in
the
air
descended
to
thirty
degrees
below
zero
an
hour
after
vasling
and
penellan
resolved
to
venture
outside
they
wrapped
themselves
up
in
their
still
wet
garments
and
went
out
by
the
opening
the
sides
of
which
had
become
as
hard
as
a
rock
we
have
been
driven
towards
the
said
vasling
reckoning
by
the
stars
which
shone
with
wonderful
brilliancy
that
would
not
be
bad
said
penellan
if
our
sledge
had
come
with
us
is
not
the
sledge
there
cried
vasling
then
we
are
lost
let
us
look
for
it
replied
penellan
they
went
around
the
hut
which
formed
a
block
more
than
fifteen
feet
high
an
immense
quantity
of
snow
had
fallen
during
the
whole
of
the
storm
and
the
wind
had
massed
it
against
the
only
elevation
which
the
plain
presented
the
entire
block
had
been
driven
by
the
wind
in
the
midst
of
the
broken
icebergs
more
than
miles
to
the
and
the
prisoners
had
suffered
the
same
fate
as
their
floating
prison
the
sledge
supported
by
another
iceberg
had
been
turned
another
way
for
no
trace
of
it
was
to
be
seen
and
the
dogs
must
have
perished
amid
the
frightful
tempest
andré
vasling
and
penellan
felt
despair
taking
possession
of
them
they
did
not
dare
to
return
to
their
companions
they
did
not
dare
to
announce
this
fatal
news
to
their
comrades
in
misfortune
they
climbed
upon
the
block
of
ice
in
which
the
hut
was
hollowed
and
could
perceive
nothing
but
the
white
immensity
which
encompassed
them
on
all
sides
already
the
cold
was
beginning
to
stiffen
their
limbs
and
the
damp
of
their
garments
was
being
transformed
into
icicles
which
hung
about
them
just
as
penellan
was
about
to
descend
he
looked
towards
andré
he
saw
him
suddenly
gaze
in
one
direction
then
shudder
and
turn
pale
what
is
the
matter
vasling
he
asked
nothing
replied
the
other
let
us
go
down
and
urge
the
captain
to
leave
these
parts
where
we
ought
never
to
have
come
at
once
instead
of
obeying
penellan
ascended
again
and
looked
in
the
direction
which
had
drawn
the
mate
attention
a
very
different
effect
was
produced
on
him
for
he
uttered
a
shout
of
joy
and
cried
blessed
be
god
a
light
smoke
was
rising
in
the
there
was
no
possibility
of
deception
it
indicated
the
presence
of
human
beings
penellan
cries
of
joy
reached
the
rest
below
and
all
were
able
to
convince
themselves
with
their
eyes
that
he
was
not
mistaken
without
thinking
of
their
want
of
provisions
or
the
severity
of
the
temperature
wrapped
in
their
hoods
they
were
all
soon
advancing
towards
the
spot
whence
the
smoke
arose
in
the
this
was
evidently
five
or
six
miles
off
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
take
exactly
the
right
direction
the
smoke
now
disappeared
and
no
elevation
served
as
a
guiding
mark
for
the
was
one
united
level
it
was
important
nevertheless
not
to
diverge
from
a
straight
line
since
we
can
not
guide
ourselves
by
distant
objects
said
jean
cornbutte
we
must
use
this
method
penellan
will
go
ahead
vasling
twenty
steps
behind
him
and
i
twenty
steps
behind
vasling
i
can
then
judge
whether
or
not
penellan
diverges
from
the
straight
line
they
had
gone
on
thus
for
half
an
hour
when
penellan
suddenly
stopped
and
listened
the
party
hurried
up
to
him
did
you
hear
nothing
he
asked
nothing
replied
misonne
it
is
strange
said
penellan
it
seemed
to
me
i
heard
cries
from
this
direction
cries
replied
marie
perhaps
we
are
near
our
destination
then
that
is
no
reason
said
andré
vasling
in
these
high
latitudes
and
cold
regions
sounds
may
be
heard
to
a
great
distance
however
that
may
be
replied
jean
cornbutte
let
us
go
forward
or
we
shall
be
frozen
no
cried
penellan
listen
some
feeble
sounds
quite
perceptible
however
were
heard
they
seemed
to
be
cries
of
distress
they
were
twice
repeated
they
seemed
like
cries
for
help
then
all
became
silent
again
i
was
not
mistaken
said
penellan
forward
he
began
to
run
in
the
direction
whence
the
cries
had
proceeded
he
went
thus
two
miles
when
to
his
utter
stupefaction
he
saw
a
man
lying
on
the
ice
he
went
up
to
him
raised
him
and
lifted
his
arms
to
heaven
in
despair
andré
vasling
who
was
following
close
behind
with
the
rest
of
the
sailors
ran
up
and
cried
it
is
one
of
the
castaways
it
is
our
sailor
courtois
he
is
dead
replied
penellan
frozen
to
death
jean
cornbutte
and
marie
came
up
beside
the
corpse
which
was
already
stiffened
by
the
ice
despair
was
written
on
every
face
the
dead
man
was
one
of
the
comrades
of
louis
cornbutte
forward
cried
penellan
they
went
on
for
half
an
hour
in
perfect
silence
and
perceived
an
elevation
which
seemed
without
doubt
to
be
land
it
is
shannon
island
said
jean
cornbutte
a
mile
farther
on
they
distinctly
perceived
smoke
escaping
from
a
closed
by
a
wooden
door
they
shouted
two
men
rushed
out
of
the
hut
and
penellan
recognized
one
of
them
as
pierre
nouquet
pierre
he
cried
pierre
stood
still
as
if
stunned
and
unconscious
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
andré
vasling
looked
at
pierre
companion
with
anxiety
mingled
with
a
cruel
joy
for
he
did
not
recognize
louis
cornbutte
in
him
pierre
it
is
i
cried
penellan
these
are
all
your
friends
pierre
nouquet
recovered
his
senses
and
fell
into
his
old
comrade
arms
and
my
son
and
louis
cried
jean
cornbutte
in
an
accent
of
the
most
profound
despair
chapter

the
return
to
the
ship
at
this
moment
a
man
almost
dead
dragged
himself
out
of
the
hut
and
along
the
ice
it
was
louis
cornbutte
illustration
it
was
louis
cornbutte
my
son
my
beloved
these
two
cries
were
uttered
at
the
same
time
and
louis
cornbutte
fell
fainting
into
the
arms
of
his
father
and
marie
who
drew
him
towards
the
hut
where
their
tender
care
soon
revived
him
my
father
marie
cried
louis
i
shall
not
die
without
having
seen
you
you
will
not
die
replied
penellan
for
all
your
friends
are
near
you
andré
vasling
must
have
hated
louis
cornbutte
bitterly
not
to
extend
his
hand
to
him
but
he
did
not
pierre
nouquet
was
wild
with
joy
he
embraced
every
body
then
he
threw
some
wood
into
the
stove
and
soon
a
comfortable
temperature
was
felt
in
the
cabin
there
were
two
men
there
whom
neither
jean
cornbutte
nor
penellan
recognized
they
were
jocki
and
herming
the
only
two
sailors
of
the
crew
of
the
norwegian
schooner
who
were
left
my
friends
we
are
saved
said
louis
my
father
marie
you
have
exposed
yourselves
to
so
many
perils
we
do
not
regret
it
my
louis
replied
the
father
your
brig

is
securely
anchored
in
the
ice
sixty
leagues
from
here
we
will
rejoin
her
all
together
when
courtois
comes
back
he
be
mightily
pleased
said
pierre
nouquet
a
mournful
silence
followed
this
and
penellan
apprised
pierre
and
louis
of
their
comrade
death
by
cold
my
friends
said
penellan
we
will
wait
here
until
the
cold
decreases
have
you
provisions
and
wood
yes
and
we
will
burn
what
is

indeed
been
driven
to
a
place
forty
miles
from
where
louis
cornbutte
had
taken
up
his
winter
quarters
there
she
was
broken
up
by
the
icebergs
floated
by
the
thaw
and
the
castaways
were
carried
with
a
part
of
the
of
their
cabin
on
the
southern
shores
of

they
were

as
for
the
rest
of

they
had
been
submerged
with
the
at
the
moment
of
the
wreck
when
louis
cornbutte
shut
in
among
the
ice
realized
what
must
happen
he
took
every
precaution
for
passing
the
winter
he
was
an
energetic
man
very
active
and
courageous
but
despite
his
firmness
he
had
been
subdued
by
this
horrible
climate
and
when
his
father
found
him
he
had
given
up
all
hope
of
life
he
had
not
only
had
to
contend
with
the
elements
but
with
the
ugly
temper
of
the
two
norwegian
sailors
who
owed
him
their
existence
they
were
like
savages
almost
inaccessible
to
the
most
natural
emotions
when
louis
had
the
opportunity
to
talk
to
penellan
he
advised
him
to
watch
them
carefully
in
return
penellan
told
him
of
andré
vasling
conduct
louis
could
not
believe
it
but
penellan
convinced
him
that
after
his
disappearance
vasling
had
always
acted
so
as
to
secure
marie
hand
the
whole
day
was
employed
in
rest
and
the
pleasures
of
reunion
misonne
and
pierre
nouquet
killed
some
near
the
hut
whence
it
was
not
prudent
to
stray
far
these
fresh
provisions
and
the
replenished
fire
raised
the
spirits
of
the
weakest
louis
cornbutte
got
visibly
better
it
was
the
first
moment
of
happiness
these
brave
people
had
experienced
they
celebrated
it
with
enthusiasm
in
this
wretched
hut
six
hundred
leagues
from
the
north
sea
in
a
temperature
of
thirty
degrees
below
zero
this
temperature
lasted
till
the
end
of
the
moon
and
it
was
not
until
about
the
of
november
a
week
after
their
meeting
that
jean
cornbutte
and
his
party
could
think
of
setting
out
they
only
had
the
light
of
the
stars
to
guide
them
but
the
cold
was
less
extreme
and
even
some
snow
fell
before
quitting
this
place
a
grave
was
dug
for
poor
courtois
it
was
a
sad
ceremony
which
deeply
affected
his
comrades
he
was
the
first
of
them
who
would
not
again
see
his
native
land
misonne
had
constructed
with
the
planks
of
the
cabin
a
sort
of
sledge
for
carrying
the
provisions
and
the
sailors
drew
it
by
turns
jean
cornbutte
led
the
expedition
by
the
ways
already
traversed
camps
were
established
with
great
promptness
when
the
times
for
repose
came
jean
cornbutte
hoped
to
find
his
deposits
of
provisions
again
as
they
had
become
indispensable
by
the
addition
of
four
persons
to
the
party
he
was
therefore
very
careful
not
to
diverge
from
the
route
by
which
he
had
come
by
good
fortune
he
recovered
his
sledge
which
had
stranded
near
the
promontory
where
they
had
all
run
so
many
dangers
the
dogs
after
eating
their
straps
to
satisfy
their
hunger
had
attacked
the
provisions
in
the
sledge
these
had
sustained
them
and
they
served
to
guide
the
party
to
the
sledge
where
there
was
a
considerable
quantity
of
provisions
left
the
little
band
resumed
its
march
towards
the
bay
the
dogs
were
harnessed
to
the
sleigh
and
no
event
of
interest
attended
the
return
it
was
observed
that
aupic
andré
vasling
and
the
norwegians
kept
aloof
and
did
not
mingle
with
the
others
but
unbeknown
to
themselves
they
were
narrowly
watched
this
germ
of
dissension
more
than
once
aroused
the
fears
of
louis
cornbutte
and
penellan
about
the
of
december
twenty
days
after
the
discovery
of
the
castaways
they
perceived
the
bay
where
the
was
lying
what
was
their
astonishment
to
see
the
brig
perched
four
yards
in
the
air
on
blocks
of
ice
they
hurried
forward
much
alarmed
for
their
companions
and
were
received
with
joyous
cries
by
gervique
turquiette
and
gradlin
all
of
them
were
in
good
health
though
they
too
had
been
subjected
to
formidable
dangers
the
tempest
had
made
itself
felt
throughout
the
polar
sea
the
ice
had
been
broken
and
displaced
crushed
one
piece
against
another
and
had
seized
the
bed
on
which
the
ship
rested
though
its
specific
weight
tended
to
carry
it
under
water
the
ice
had
acquired
an
incalculable
force
and
the
brig
had
been
suddenly
raised
up
out
of
the
sea
the
first
moments
were
given
up
to
the
happiness
inspired
by
the
safe
return
the
exploring
party
were
rejoiced
to
find
everything
in
good
condition
which
assured
them
a
supportable
though
it
might
be
a
rough
winter
the
ship
had
not
been
shaken
by
her
sudden
elevation
and
was
perfectly
tight
when
the
season
of
thawing
came
they
would
only
have
to
slide
her
down
an
inclined
plane
to
launch
her
in
a
word
in
the
once
more
open
sea
but
a
bad
piece
of
news
spread
gloom
on
the
faces
of
jean
cornbutte
and
his
comrades
during
the
terrible
gale
the
snow
storehouse
on
the
coast
had
been
quite
demolished
the
provisions
which
it
contained
were
scattered
and
it
had
not
been
possible
to
save
a
morsel
of
them
when
jean
and
louis
cornbutte
learnt
this
they
visited
the
hold
and
steward
room
to
ascertain
the
quantity
of
provisions
which
still
remained
the
thaw
would
not
come
until
may
and
the
brig
could
not
leave
the
bay
before
that
period
they
had
therefore
five
winter
months
before
them
to
pass
amid
the
ice
during
which
fourteen
persons
were
to
be
fed
having
made
his
calculations
jean
cornbutte
found
that
he
would
at
most
be
able
to
keep
them
alive
till
the
time
for
departure
by
putting
each
and
all
on
half
rations
hunting
for
game
became
compulsory
to
procure
food
in
larger
quantity
for
fear
that
they
might
again
run
short
of
provisions
it
was
decided
to
deposit
them
no
longer
in
the
ground
all
of
them
were
kept
on
board
and
beds
were
disposed
for
the
new
comers
in
the
common
lodging
turquiette
gervique
and
gradlin
during
the
absence
of
the
others
had
hollowed
out
a
flight
of
steps
in
the
ice
which
enabled
them
easily
to
reach
the
ship
deck
chapter

the
two
rivals
andré
vasling
had
been
cultivating
the
of
the
two
norwegian
sailors
aupic
also
made
one
of
their
band
and
held
himself
apart
with
loud
disapproval
of
all
the
new
measures
taken
but
louis
cornbutte
to
whom
his
father
had
transferred
the
command
of
the
ship
and
who
had
become
once
more
master
on
board
would
listen
to
no
objections
from
that
quarter
and
in
spite
of
marie
advice
to
act
gently
made
it
known
that
he
intended
to
be
obeyed
on
all
points
nevertheless
the
two
norwegians
succeeded
two
days
after
in
getting
possession
of
a
box
of
salt
meat
louis
ordered
them
to
return
it
to
him
on
the
spot
but
aupic
took
their
part
and
andré
vasling
declared
that
the
precautions
about
the
food
could
not
be
any
longer
enforced
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
show
these
men
that
these
measures
were
for
the
common
interest
for
they
knew
it
well
and
only
sought
a
pretext
to
revolt
penellan
advanced
towards
the
norwegians
who
drew
their
cutlasses
but
aided
by
misonne
and
turquiette
he
succeeded
in
snatching
the
weapons
from
their
hands
and
gained
possession
of
the
salt
meat
andré
vasling
and
aupic
seeing
that
matters
were
going
against
them
did
not
interfere
louis
cornbutte
however
took
the
mate
aside
and
said
to
him
illustration
penellan
advanced
towards
the
norwegians
andré
vasling
you
are
a
wretch
i
know
your
whole
conduct
and
i
know
what
you
are
aiming
at
but
as
the
safety
of
the
whole
crew
is
confided
to
me
if
any
man
of
you
thinks
of
conspiring
to
destroy
them
i
will
stab
him
with
my
own
hand
louis
cornbutte
replied
the
mate
it
is
allowable
for
you
to
act
the
master
but
remember
that
absolute
obedience
does
not
exist
here
and
that
here
the
strongest
alone
makes
the
law
marie
had
never
trembled
before
the
dangers
of
the
polar
seas
but
she
was
terrified
by
this
hatred
of
which
she
was
the
cause
and
the
captain
vigour
hardly
reassured
her
despite
this
declaration
of
war
the
meals
were
partaken
of
in
common
and
at
the
same
hours
hunting
furnished
some
ptarmigans
and
white
hares
but
this
resource
would
soon
fail
them
with
the
approach
of
the
terrible
cold
weather
this
began
at
the
solstice
on
the
of
december
on
which
day
the
thermometer
fell
to
degrees
below
zero
the
men
experienced
pain
in
their
ears
noses
and
the
extremities
of
their
bodies
they
were
seized
with
a
mortal
torpor
combined
with
headache
and
their
breathing
became
more
and
more
difficult
in
this
state
they
had
no
longer
any
courage
to
go
hunting
or
to
take
any
exercise
they
remained
crouched
around
the
stove
which
gave
them
but
a
meagre
heat
and
when
they
went
away
from
it
they
perceived
that
their
blood
suddenly
cooled
jean
cornbutte
health
was
seriously
impaired
and
he
could
no
longer
quit
his
lodging
symptoms
of
scurvy
manifested
themselves
in
him
and
his
legs
were
soon
covered
with
white
spots
marie
was
well
however
and
occupied
herself
tending
the
sick
ones
with
the
zeal
of
a
sister
of
charity
the
honest
fellows
blessed
her
from
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
the
of
january
was
one
of
the
gloomiest
of
these
winter
days
the
wind
was
violent
and
the
cold
insupportable
they
could
not
go
out
except
at
the
risk
of
being
frozen
the
most
courageous
were
fain
to
limit
themselves
to
walking
on
deck
sheltered
by
the
tent
jean
cornbutte
gervique
and
gradlin
did
not
leave
their
beds
the
two
norwegians
aupic
and
andré
vasling
whose
health
was
good
cast
ferocious
looks
at
their
companions
whom
they
saw
wasting
away
louis
cornbutte
led
penellan
on
deck
and
asked
him
how
much
firing
was
left
the
coal
was
exhausted
long
ago
replied
penellan
and
we
are
about
to
burn
our
last
pieces
of
wood
if
we
are
not
able
to
keep
off
this
cold
we
are
lost
said
louis
there
still
remains
a
way
said
penellan
to
burn
what
we
can
of
the
brig
from
the
barricading
to
the
and
we
can
even
if
need
be
demolish
her
entirely
and
rebuild
a
smaller
craft
that
is
an
extreme
means
replied
louis
which
it
will
be
full
time
to
employ
when
our
men
are
well
for
he
added
in
a
low
voice
our
force
is
diminishing
and
that
of
our
enemies
seems
to
be
increasing
that
is
extraordinary
it
is
true
said
penellan
and
unless
we
took
the
precaution
to
watch
night
and
day
i
know
not
what
would
happen
to
us
let
us
take
our
hatchets
returned
louis
and
make
our
harvest
of
wood
despite
the
cold
they
mounted
on
the
forward
barricading
and
cut
off
all
the
wood
which
was
not
indispensably
necessary
to
the
ship
then
they
returned
with
this
new
provision
the
fire
was
started
afresh
and
a
man
remained
on
guard
to
prevent
it
from
going
out
meanwhile
louis
cornbutte
and
his
friends
were
soon
tired
out
they
could
not
confide
any
detail
of
the
life
in
common
to
their
enemies
charged
with
all
the
domestic
cares
their
powers
were
soon
exhausted
the
scurvy
betrayed
itself
in
jean
cornbutte
who
suffered
intolerable
pain
gervique
and
gradlin
showed
symptoms
of
the
same
disease
had
it
not
been
for
the
with
which
they
were
abundantly
furnished
they
would
have
speedily
succumbed
to
their
sufferings
this
remedy
was
not
spared
in
relieving
them
but
one
day
the
of
january
when
louis
cornbutte
was
going
down
into
the
steward
room
to
get
some
lemons
he
was
stupefied
to
find
that
the
barrels
in
which
they
were
kept
had
disappeared
he
hurried
up
and
told
penellan
of
this
misfortune
a
theft
had
been
committed
and
it
was
easy
to
recognize
its
authors
louis
cornbutte
then
understood
why
the
health
of
his
enemies
continued
so
good
his
friends
were
no
longer
strong
enough
to
take
the
lemons
away
from
them
though
his
life
and
that
of
his
comrades
depended
on
the
fruit
and
he
now
sank
for
the
first
time
into
a
gloomy
state
of
despair
chapter
xiv
distress
on
the
of
january
most
of
the
crew
had
not
the
strength
to
leave
their
beds
each
independently
of
his
woollen
coverings
had
a
to
protect
him
against
the
cold
but
as
soon
as
he
put
his
arms
outside
the
clothes
he
felt
a
pain
which
obliged
him
quickly
to
cover
them
again
meanwhile
louis
having
lit
the
stove
fire
penellan
misonne
and
andré
vasling
left
their
beds
and
crouched
around
it
penellan
prepared
some
boiling
coffee
which
gave
them
some
strength
as
well
as
marie
who
joined
them
in
partaking
of
it
louis
cornbutte
approached
his
father
bedside
the
old
man
was
almost
motionless
and
his
limbs
were
helpless
from
disease
he
muttered
some
disconnected
words
which
carried
grief
to
his
son
heart
louis
said
he
i
am
dying
o
how
i
suffer
save
me
louis
took
a
decisive
resolution
he
went
up
to
the
mate
and
controlling
himself
with
difficulty
said
do
you
know
where
the
lemons
are
vasling
in
the
steward
room
i
suppose
returned
the
mate
without
stirring
you
know
they
are
not
there
as
you
have
stolen
them
you
are
master
louis
cornbutte
and
may
say
and
do
anything
for
pity
sake
andré
vasling
my
father
is
dying
you
can
save
him
answer
i
have
nothing
to
answer
replied
andré
vasling
wretch
cried
penellan
throwing
himself
cutlass
in
hand
on
the
mate
help
friends
shouted
vasling
retreating
aupic
and
the
two
norwegian
sailors
jumped
from
their
beds
and
placed
themselves
behind
him
turquiette
penellan
and
louis
prepared
to
defend
themselves
pierre
nouquet
and
gradlin
though
suffering
much
rose
to
second
them
you
are
still
too
strong
for
us
said
vasling
we
do
not
wish
to
fight
on
an
uncertainty
the
sailors
were
so
weak
that
they
dared
not
attack
the
four
rebels
for
had
they
failed
they
would
have
been
lost
andré
vasling
said
louis
cornbutte
in
a
gloomy
tone
if
my
father
dies
you
will
have
murdered
him
and
i
will
kill
you
like
a
dog
vasling
and
his
confederates
retired
to
the
other
end
of
the
cabin
and
did
not
reply
it
was
then
necessary
to
renew
the
supply
of
wood
and
in
spite
of
the
cold
louis
went
on
deck
and
began
to
cut
away
a
part
of
the
barricading
but
was
obliged
to
retreat
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
he
was
in
danger
of
falling
overcome
by
the
freezing
air
as
he
passed
he
cast
a
glance
at
the
thermometer
left
outside
and
saw
that
the
mercury
was
frozen
the
cold
then
exceeded
degrees
below
zero
the
weather
was
dry
and
the
wind
blew
from
the
north
on
the
the
wind
changed
to
the
and
the
thermometer
outside
stood
at
degrees
jean
cornbutte
was
in
agony
and
his
son
had
searched
in
vain
for
some
remedy
with
which
to
relieve
his
pain
on
this
day
however
throwing
himself
suddenly
on
vasling
he
managed
to
snatch
a
lemon
from
him
which
he
was
about
to
suck
vasling
made
no
attempt
to
recover
it
he
seemed
to
be
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
accomplish
his
wicked
designs
the
somewhat
relieved
old
cornbutte
but
it
was
necessary
to
continue
the
remedy
marie
begged
vasling
on
her
knees
to
produce
the
lemons
but
he
did
not
reply
and
soon
penellan
heard
the
wretch
say
to
his
accomplices
illustration
marie
begged
vasling
on
her
knees
to
produce
the
lemons
but
he
did
not
reply
the
old
fellow
is
dying
gervique
gradlin
and
nouquet
are
not
much
better
the
others
are
daily
losing
their
strength
the
time
is
near
when
their
lives
will
belong
to
us
it
was
then
resolved
by
louis
cornbutte
and
his
adherents
not
to
wait
and
to
profit
by
the
little
strength
which
still
remained
to
them
they
determined
to
act
the
next
night
and
to
kill
these
wretches
so
as
not
to
be
killed
by
them
the
temperature
rose
a
little
louis
cornbutte
ventured
to
go
out
with
his
gun
in
search
of
some
game
he
proceeded
some
three
miles
from
the
ship
and
often
deceived
by
the
effects
of
the
mirage
and
refraction
he
went
farther
away
than
he
intended
it
was
imprudent
for
recent
tracts
of
ferocious
animals
were
to
be
seen
he
did
not
wish
however
to
return
without
some
fresh
meat
and
continued
on
his
route
but
he
then
experienced
a
strange
feeling
which
turned
his
head
it
was
what
is
called
white
vertigo
the
reflection
of
the
ice
hillocks
and
fields
affected
him
from
head
to
foot
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
dazzling
colour
penetrated
him
and
caused
an
irresistible
nausea
his
eye
was
attacked
his
sight
became
uncertain
he
thought
he
should
go
mad
with
the
glare
without
fully
understanding
this
terrible
effect
he
advanced
on
his
way
and
soon
put
up
a
ptarmigan
which
he
eagerly
pursued
the
bird
soon
fell
and
in
order
to
reach
it
louis
leaped
from
an
and
fell
heavily
for
the
leap
was
at
least
ten
feet
and
the
refraction
made
him
think
it
was
only
two
the
vertigo
then
seized
him
and
without
knowing
why
he
began
to
call
for
help
though
he
had
not
been
injured
by
the
fall
the
cold
began
to
take
him
and
he
rose
with
pain
urged
by
the
sense
of
suddenly
without
being
able
to
account
for
it
he
smelt
an
odour
of
boiling
fat
as
the
ship
was
between
him
and
the
wind
he
supposed
that
this
odour
proceeded
from
her
and
could
not
imagine
why
they
should
be
cooking
fat
this
being
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
as
it
was
likely
to
attract
the
white
bears
louis
returned
towards
the
ship
absorbed
in
reflections
which
soon
inspired
his
excited
mind
with
terror
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
colossal
masses
were
moving
on
the
horizon
and
he
asked
himself
if
there
was
not
another
several
of
these
masses
interposed
themselves
between
him
and
the
ship
and
appeared
to
rise
about
its
sides
he
stopped
to
gaze
at
them
more
attentively
when
to
his
horror
he
recognized
a
herd
of
gigantic
bears
these
animals
had
been
attracted
by
the
odour
of
grease
which
had
surprised
lonis
he
sheltered
himself
behind
a
hillock
and
counted
three
which
were
scaling
the
blocks
on
which
the
was
resting
nothing
led
him
to
suppose
that
this
danger
was
known
in
the
interior
of
the
ship
and
a
terrible
anguish
oppressed
his
heart
how
resist
these
redoubtable
enemies
would
andré
vasling
and
his
confederates
unite
with
the
rest
on
board
in
the
common
peril
could
penellan
and
the
others
half
starved
benumbed
with
cold
resist
these
formidable
animals
made
wild
by
unassuaged
hunger
would
they
not
be
surprised
by
an
attack
louis
made
these
reflections
rapidly
the
bears
had
crossed
the
blocks
and
were
mounting
to
the
assault
of
the
ship
he
might
then
quit
the
block
which
protected
him
he
went
nearer
clinging
to
the
ice
and
could
soon
see
the
enormous
animals
tearing
the
tent
with
their
paws
and
leaping
on
the
deck
he
thought
of
firing
his
gun
to
give
his
comrades
notice
but
if
these
came
up
without
arms
they
would
inevitably
be
torn
in
pieces
and
nothing
showed
as
yet
that
they
were
even
aware
of
their
new
danger
chapter

the
white
bears
after
louis
cornbutte
departure
penellan
had
carefully
shut
the
cabin
door
which
opened
at
the
foot
of
the
deck
steps
he
returned
to
the
stove
which
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
watch
whilst
his
companions
regained
their
berths
in
search
of
a
little
warmth
it
was
then
six
in
the
evening
and
penellan
set
about
preparing
supper
he
went
down
into
the
steward
room
for
some
salt
meat
which
he
wished
to
soak
in
the
boiling
water
when
he
returned
he
found
andré
vasling
in
his
place
cooking
some
pieces
of
grease
in
a
basin
i
was
there
before
you
said
penellan
roughly
why
have
you
taken
my
place
for
the
same
reason
that
you
claim
it
returned
vasling
because
i
want
to
cook
my
supper
you
will
take
that
off
at
once
or
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
nothing
said
vasling
my
supper
shall
be
cooked
in
spite
of
you
you
shall
not
eat
it

cried
penellan
rushing
upon
vasling

seized

cutlass

these
in
the

sprang
to

come
penellan
precipitated
himself
upon
vasling
to
whom
no
doubt
was
confided
the
task
to
fight
him
alone
for
his
accomplices
rushed
to
the
beds
where
lay
misonne
turquiette
and
nouquet
the
latter
ill
and
defenceless
was
delivered
over
to
ferocity
the
carpenter
seized
a
hatchet
and
leaving
his
berth
hurried
up
to
encounter
aupic
turquiette
and
jocki
the
norwegian
struggled
fiercely
gervique
and
gradlin
suffering
horribly
were
not
even
conscious
of
what
was
passing
around
them
nouquet
soon
received
a
stab
in
the
side
and
herming
turned
to
penellan
who
was
fighting
desperately
andré
vasling
had
seized
him
round
the
body
at
the
beginning
of
the
affray
the
basin
had
been
upset
on
the
stove
and
the
grease
running
over
the
burning
coals
impregnated
the
atmosphere
with
its
odour

marie
rose
with
cries
of
despair
and
hurried
to
the
bed
of
old
jean
cornbutte
vasling
less
strong
than
penellan
soon
perceived
that
the
latter
was
getting
the
better
of
him
they
were
too
close
together
to
make
use
of
their
weapons
the
mate
seeing
herming
cried
out

misonne
shouted
penellan
in
his
turn
but
misonne
was
rolling
on
the
ground
with
aupic
who
was
trying
to
stab
him
with
his
cutlass
the
carpenter
hatchet
was
of
little
use
to
him
for
he
could
not
wield
it
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
he
parried
the
lunges
which
aupic
made
with
his
knife
meanwhile
blood
flowed
amid
the
groans
and
cries
turquiette
thrown
down
by
jocki
a
man
of
immense
strength
had
received
a
wound
in
the
shoulder
and
he
tried
in
vain
to
clutch
a
pistol
which
hung
in
the
norwegian
belt
the
latter
held
him
as
in
a
vice
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
move
at
vasling
cry
for
help
who
was
being
held
by
penellan
close
against
the
door
herming
rushed
up
as
he
was
about
to
stab
the
breton
back
with
his
cutlass
the
latter
felled
him
to
the
earth
with
a
vigorous
kick
his
effort
to
do
this
enabled
vasling
to
disengage
his
right
arm
but
the
door
against
which
they
pressed
with
all
their
weight
suddenly
yielded
and
vasling
fell
over
of
a
sudden
a
terrible
growl
was
heard
and
a
gigantic
bear
appeared
on
the
steps
vasling
saw
him
first
he
was
not
four
feet
away
from
him
at
the
same
moment
a
shot
was
heard
and
the
bear
wounded
or
frightened
retreated
vasling
who
had
succeeded
in
regaining
his
feet
in
pursuit
of
him
abandoning
penellan
penellan
then
replaced
the
door
and
looked
around
him
misonne
and
turquiette
tightly
garrotted
by
their
antagonists
had
been
thrown
into
a
corner
and
made
vain
efforts
to
break
loose
penellan
rushed
to
their
assistance
but
was
overturned
by
the
two
norwegians
and
aupic
his
exhausted
strength
did
not
permit
him
to
resist
these
three
men
who
so
clung
to
him
as
to
hold
him
motionless
then
at
the
cries
of
the
mate
they
hurried
on
deck
thinking
that
louis
cornbutte
was
to
be
encountered
andré
vasling
was
struggling
with
a
bear
which
he
had
already
twice
stabbed
with
his
knife
the
animal
beating
the
air
with
his
heavy
paws
was
trying
to
clutch
vasling
he
retiring
little
by
little
on
the
barricading
was
apparently
doomed
when
a
second
shot
was
heard
the
bear
fell
andré
vasling
raised
his
head
and
saw
louis
cornbutte
in
the
ratlines
of
the
his
gun
in
his
hand
louis
had
shot
the
bear
in
the
heart
and
he
was
dead
hate
overcame
gratitude
in
vasling
breast
but
before
satisfying
it
he
looked
around
him
aupic
head
was
broken
by
a
and
he
lay
lifeless
on
deck
jocki
hatchet
in
hand
was
with
difficulty
parrying
the
blows
of
the
second
bear
which
had
just
killed
aupic
the
animal
had
received
two
wounds
and
still
struggled
desperately
a
third
bear
was
directing
his
way
towards
the
ship
prow
vasling
paid
no
attention
to
him
but
followed
by
herming
went
to
the
aid
of
jocki
but
jocki
seized
by
the
beast
paws
was
crushed
and
when
the
bear
fell
under
the
shots
of
the
other
two
men
he
held
only
a
corpse
in
his
shaggy
arms
we
are
only
two
now
said
vasling
with
gloomy
ferocity
but
if
we
yield
it
will
not
be
without
vengeance
herming
reloaded
his
pistol
without
replying
before
all
the
third
bear
must
be
got
rid
of
vasling
looked
forward
but
did
not
see
him
on
raising
his
eyes
he
perceived
him
erect
on
the
barricading
clinging
to
the
ratlines
and
trying
to
reach
louis
vasling
let
his
gun
fall
which
he
had
aimed
at
the
animal
while
a
fierce
joy
glittered
in
his
eyes
ah
he
cried
you
owe
me
that
vengeance
louis
took
refuge
in
the
top
of
the
mast
the
bear
kept
mounting
and
was
not
more
than
six
feet
from
louis
when
he
raised
his
gun
and
pointed
it
at
the
animal
heart
vasling
raised
his
weapon
to
shoot
louis
if
the
bear
fell
louis
fired
but
the
bear
did
not
appear
to
be
hit
for
he
leaped
with
a
bound
towards
the
top
the
whole
mast
shook
vasling
uttered
a
shout
of
exultation
herming
he
cried
go
and
find
marie
go
and
find
my
betrothed
herming
descended
the
cabin
stairs
meanwhile
the
furious
beast
had
thrown
himself
upon
louis
who
was
trying
to
shelter
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
mast
but
at
the
moment
that
his
enormous
paw
was
raised
to
break
his
head
louis
seizing
one
of
the
backstays
let
himself
slip
down
to
the
deck
not
without
danger
for
a
ball
hissed
by
his
ear
when
he
was
down
vasling
had
shot
at
him
and
missed
him
the
two
adversaries
now
confronted
each
other
cutlass
in
hand
the
combat
was
about
to
become
decisive
to
entirely
glut
his
vengeance
and
to
have
the
young
girl
witness
her
lover
death
vasling
had
deprived
himself
of
herming
aid
he
could
now
reckon
only
on
himself
louis
and
vasling
seized
each
other
by
the
collar
and
held
each
other
with
iron
grip
one
of
them
must
fall
they
struck
each
other
violently
the
blows
were
only
half
parried
for
blood
soon
flowed
from
both
vasling
tried
to
clasp
his
adversary
about
the
neck
with
his
arm
to
bring
him
to
the
ground
louis
knowing
that
he
who
fell
was
lost
prevented
him
and
succeeded
in
grasping
his
two
arms
but
in
doing
this
he
let
fall
his
cutlass
piteous
cries
now
assailed
his
ears

up

was
seized
with
a
desperate
rage
he
stiffened
himself
to
bend

loins
but
at
this
moment
the
combatants
felt
themselves
seized
in
a
powerful
embrace
the
bear

descended
from

fallen
upon
the

discharged

he
roared
the
pain
made
him
relax
his

for
a
moment

louis
exhausted
fell
motionless
on

deck

the

closing
his

tightly
in

agony
fell

conclusion
herming
mortally
wounded
had
been
carried
to
a
berth
by
misonne
and
turquiette
who
had
succeeded
in
getting
free
he
was
already
at
the
last
gasp
of
death
and
the
two
sailors
occupied
themselves
with
nouquet
whose
wound
was
not
happily
a
serious
one
but
a
greater
misfortune
had
overtaken
louis
cornbutte
his
father
no
longer
gave
any
signs
of
life
had
he
died
of
anxiety
for
his
son
delivered
over
to
his
enemies
had
he
succumbed
in
presence
of
these
terrible
events
they
could
not
tell
but
the
poor
old
sailor
broken
by
disease
had
ceased
to
live
at
this
unexpected
blow
louis
and
marie
fell
into
a
sad
despair
then
they
knelt
at
the
bedside
and
wept
as
they
prayed
for
jean
cornbutte
soul
penellan
misonne
and
turquiette
left
them
alone
in
the
cabin
and
went
on
deck
the
bodies
of
the
three
bears
were
carried
forward
penellan
decided
to
keep
their
skins
which
would
be
of
no
little
use
but
he
did
not
think
for
a
moment
of
eating
their
flesh
besides
the
number
of
men
to
feed
was
now
much
decreased
the
bodies
of
vasling
aupic
and
jocki
thrown
into
a
hole
dug
on
the
coast
were
soon
rejoined
by
that
of
herming
the
norwegian
died
during
the
night
without
repentance
or
remorse
foaming
at
the
mouth
with
rage
the
three
sailors
repaired
the
tent
which
torn
in
several
places
permitted
the
snow
to
fall
on
the
deck
the
temperature
was
exceedingly
cold
and
kept
so
till
the
return
of
the
sun
which
did
not
reappear
above
the
horizon
till
the
of
january
jean
cornbutte
was
buried
on
the
coast
he
had
left
his
native
land
to
find
his
son
and
had
died
in
these
terrible
regions
his
grave
was
dug
on
an
eminence
and
the
sailors
placed
over
it
a
simple
wooden
cross
from
that
day
louis
cornbutte
and
his
comrades
passed
through
many
other
trials
but
the
lemons
which
they
found
restored
them
to
health
gervique
gradlin
and
nouquet
were
able
to
rise
from
their
berths
a
fortnight
after
these
terrible
events
and
to
take
a
little
exercise
soon
hunting
for
game
became
more
easy
and
its
results
more
abundant
the
returned
in
large
numbers
they
often
brought
down
a
kind
of
wild
duck
which
made
excellent
food
the
hunters
had
no
other
deprivation
to
deplore
than
that
of
two
dogs
which
they
lost
in
an
expedition
to
reconnoitre
the
state
of
the
icefields
miles
to
the
southward
the
month
of
february
was
signalized
by
violent
tempests
and
abundant
snows
the
mean
temperature
was
still
degrees
below
zero
but
they
did
not
suffer
in
comparison
with
past
hardships
besides
the
sight
of
the
sun
which
rose
higher
and
higher
above
the
horizon
rejoiced
them
as
it
forecast
the
end
of
their
torments
heaven
had
pity
on
them
for
warmth
came
sooner
than
usual
that
year
the
ravens
appeared
in
march
careering
about
the
ship
louis
cornbutte
captured
some
cranes
which
had
wandered
thus
far
northward
flocks
of
wild
birds
were
also
seen
in
the
south
the
return
of
the
birds
indicated
a
diminution
of
the
cold
but
it
was
not
safe
to
rely
upon
this
for
with
a
change
of
wind
or
in
the
new
or
full
moons
the
temperature
suddenly
fell
and
the
sailors
were
forced
to
resort
to
their
most
careful
precautions
to
protect
themselves
against
it
they
had
already
burned
all
the
barricading
the
bulkheads
and
a
large
portion
of
the
bridge
it
was
time
then
that
their
wintering
was
over
happily
the
mean
temperature
of
march
was
not
over
sixteen
degrees
below
zero
marie
occupied
herself
with
preparing
new
clothing
for
the
advanced
season
of
the
year
after
the
equinox
the
sun
had
remained
constantly
above
the
horizon
the
eight
months
of
perpetual
daylight
had
begun
this
continual
sunlight
with
the
increasing
though
still
quite
feeble
heat
soon
began
to
act
upon
the
ice
great
precautions
were
necessary
in
launching
the
ship
from
the
lofty
layer
of
ice
which
surrounded
her
she
was
therefore
securely
propped
up
and
it
seemed
best
to
await
the
breaking
up
of
the
ice
but
the
lower
mass
resting
on
a
bed
of
already
warm
water
detached
itself
little
by
little
and
the

gradually
descended
with
it
early
in
april
she
had
reached
her
natural
level
torrents
of
rain
came
with
april
which
extending
in
waves
over
the
hastened
still
more
its
breaking
up
the
thermometer
rose
to
ten
degrees
below
zero
some
of
the
men
took
off
their
clothes
and
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
keep
a
fire
in
the
cabin
stove
day
and
night
the
provision
of
spirit
which
was
not
exhausted
was
used
only
for
cooking
the
food
soon
the
ice
began
to
break
up
rapidly
and
it
became
imprudent
to
venture
upon
the
plain
without
a
staff
to
sound
the
passages
for
fissures
wound
in
spirals
here
and
there
some
of
the
sailors
fell
into
the
water
with
no
worse
result
however
than
a
pretty
cold
bath
the
seals
returned
and
they
were
often
hunted
and
their
grease
utilized
the
health
of
the
crew
was
fully
restored
and
the
time
was
employed
in
hunting
and
preparations
for
departure
louis
cornbutte
often
examined
the
channels
and
decided
in
consequence
of
the
shape
of
the
southern
coast
to
attempt
a
passage
in
that
direction
the
breaking
up
had
already
begun
here
and
there
and
the
floating
ice
began
to
pass
off
towards
the
high
seas
on
the
of
april
the
ship
was
put
in
readiness
the
sails
taken
from
their
sheaths
were
found
to
be
perfectly
preserved
and
it
was
with
real
delight
that
the
sailors
saw
them
once
more
swaying
in
the
wind
the
ship
gave
a
lurch
for
she
had
found
her
floating
line
and
though
she
would
not
yet
move
forward
she
lay
quietly
and
easily
in
her
natural
element
in
may
the
thaw
became
very
rapid
the
snow
which
covered
the
coast
melted
on
every
hand
and
formed
a
thick
mud
which
made
it
impossible
to
land
small
heathers
rosy
and
white
peeped
out
timidly
above
the
lingering
snow
and
seemed
to
smile
at
the
little
heat
they
received
the
thermometer
at
last
rose
above
zero
twenty
miles
off
the
ice
masses
entirely
separated

towards
the
atlantic
ocean

the
sea
was
not
quite
free

by
which
louis
cornbutte
wished
to
profit
on
the
of
may
after
a
parting
visit
to
his
father
grave
louis
at
last
set
out
from
the
bay
the
hearts
of
the
honest
sailors
were
filled
at
once
with
joy
and
sadness
for
one
does
not
leave
without
regret
a
place
where
a
friend
has
died
the
wind
blew
from
the
north
and
favoured
their
departure
the
ship
was
often
arrested
by
which
were
cut
with
the
saws
icebergs
not
seldom
confronted
her
and
it
was
necessary
to
blow
them
up
with
powder
for
a
month
the
way
was
full
of
perils
which
sometimes
brought
the
ship
to
the
verge
of
destruction
but
the
crew
were
sturdy
and
used
to
these
dangerous
exigencies
penellan

of

she
came
in

she
had
been
signalled
by
the
and
the
whole
population
flocked
to
the
jetty
the
sailors
of
the
ship
were
soon
clasped

their
friends

the
fortieth
french
ascent
of
mont
blanc
by
paul
verne
i
arrived
at
chamonix
on
the
of
august
fully
decided
to
make
the
ascent
of
mont
blanc
cost
what
it
might
my
first
attempt
in
august
was
not
successful
bad
weather
had
prevented
me
from
mounting
beyond
the
this
time
circumstances
seemed
scarcely
more
favourable
for
the
weather
which
had
promised
to
be
fine
on
the
morning
of
the
suddenly
changed
towards
noon
mont
blanc
as
they
say
in
its
neighbourhood
put
on
its
cap
and
began
to
smoke
its
pipe
which
to
speak
more
plainly
means
that
it
is
covered
with
clouds
and
that
the
snow
driven
upon
it
by
a
wind
formed
a
long
crest
on
its
summit
in
the
direction
of
the
unfathomable
precipices
of
the
brenva
glaciers
this
crest
betrayed
to
imprudent
tourists
the
route
they
would
have
taken
had
they
had
the
temerity
to
venture
upon
the
mountain
the
next
night
was
very
inclement
the
rain
and
wind
were
violent
and
the
barometer
below
the
change
remained
stationary
towards
daybreak
however
several
announced
a
change
in
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
soon
the
clouds
broke
the
chain
of
the
brevent
and
the
betrayed
itself
the
wind
turning
to
the
brought
into
view
above
the
col
de
balme
which
shuts
in
the
valley
of
chamonix
on
the
north
some
light
isolated
fleecy
clouds
which
i
hailed
as
the
heralds
of
fine
weather
despite
this
happy
augury
and
a
slight
rise
in
the
barometer
balmat
chief
guide
of
chamonix
declared
to
me
that
i
must
not
yet
think
of
attempting
the
ascent
if
the
barometer
continues
to
rise
he
added
and
the
weather
holds
good
i
promise
you
guides
for
the
day
after
perhaps
for
meanwhile
have
patience
and
stretch
your
legs
i
will
take
you
up
the
brevent
the
clouds
are
clearing
away
and
you
will
be
able
to
exactly
distinguish
the
path
you
will
have
to
go
over
to
reach
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
if
in
spite
of
this
you
are
determined
to
go
you
may
try
it
this
speech
uttered
in
a
certain
tone
was
not
very
reassuring
and
gave
food
for
reflection
still
i
accepted
his
proposition
and
he
chose
as
my
companion
the
guide
edward
ravanel
a
very
sedate
and
devoted
fellow
who
perfectly
knew
his
business
donatien
levesque
an
enthusiastic
tourist
and
an
intrepid
pedestrian
who
had
made
early
in
the
previous
year
an
interesting
and
difficult
trip
in
north
america
was
with
me
he
had
already
visited
the
greater
part
of
america
and
was
about
to
descend
the
mississippi
to
new
orleans
when
the
war
cut
short
his
projects
and
recalled
him
to
france
we
had
met
at
and
we
had
determined
to
make
an
excursion
together
in
savoy
and
switzerland
donatien
levesque
knew
my
intentions
and
as
he
thought
that
his
health
would
not
permit
him
to
attempt
so
long
a
journey
over
the
glaciers
it
had
been
agreed
that
he
should
await
my
return
from
mont
blanc
at
chamonix
and
should
make
the
traditional
visit
to
the
by
the
montanvers
during
my
absence
on
learning
that
i
was
going
to
ascend
the
brevent
my
friend
did
not
hesitate
to
accompany
me
thither
the
ascent
of
the
brevent
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
trips
that
can
be
made
from
chamonix
this
mountain
about
seven
thousand
six
hundred
feet
high
is
only
the
prolongation
of
the
chain
for
the
which
runs
from
the
to
the
parallel
with
that
of
mont
blanc
and
forms
with
it
the
narrow
valley
of
chamonix
the
brevent
by
its
central
position
exactly
opposite
the
bossons
glacier
enables
one
to
watch
the
parties
which
undertake
the
ascent
of
the
giant
of
the
alps
nearly
throughout
their
journey
it
is
therefore
much
frequented
we
started
about
seven
in
the
morning
as
we
went
along
i
thought
of
the
mysterious
words
of
the
they
annoyed
me
a
little
addressing
ravanel
i
said
have
you
made
the
ascent
of
mont
blanc
yes
monsieur
he
replied
once
and
that
enough
i
am
not
anxious
to
do
it
again
the
deuce
said
i
i
am
going
to
try
it
you
are
free
monsieur
but
i
shall
not
go
with
you
the
mountain
is
not
good
this
year
several
attempts
have
already
been
made
two
only
have
succeeded
as
for
the
second
the
party
tried
the
ascent
twice
besides
the
accident
last
year
has
rather
cooled
the
amateurs
an
accident
what
accident
did
not
monsieur
hear
of
it
this
is
how
it
happened
a
party
consisting
of
ten
guides
and
porters
and
two
englishmen
started
about
the
middle
of
september
for
mont
blanc
they
were
seen
to
reach
the
summit
then
some
minutes
after
they
disappeared
in
a
cloud
when
the
cloud
passed
over
no
one
was
visible
the
two
travellers
with
seven
guides
and
porters
had
been
blown
off
by
the
wind
and
precipitated
on
the
cormayeur
side
doubtless
into
the
brenva
glacier
despite
the
most
vigilant
search
their
bodies
could
not
be
found
the
other
three
were
found
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
below
the
summit
near
the
they
had
become
blocks
of
ice
but
these
travellers
must
have
been
imprudent
said
i
to
ravanel
what
folly
it
was
to
start
off
so
late
in
the
year
on
such
an
expedition
they
should
have
gone
up
in
august
i
vainly
tried
to
keep
up
my
courage
this
lugubrious
story
would
haunt
me
in
spite
of
myself
happily
the
weather
soon
cleared
and
the
rays
of
a
bright
sun
dissipated
the
clouds
which
still
veiled
mont
blanc
and
at
the
same
time
those
which
overshadowed
my
thoughts
our
ascent
was
satisfactorily
accomplished
on
leaving
the
chalets
of
planpraz
situated
at
a
height
of
two
thousand
and
yards
you
ascend
on
ragged
masses
of
rock
and
pools
of
snow
to
the
foot
of
a
rock
called
the
chimney
which
is
scaled
with
the
feet
and
hands
twenty
minutes
after
you
reach
the
summit
of
the
brevent
whence
the
view
is
very
fine
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
appears
in
all
its
majesty
the
gigantic
mountain
firmly
established
on
its
powerful
strata
seems
to
defy
the
tempests
which
sweep
across
its
icy
shield
without
ever
impairing
it
whilst
the
crowd
of
icy
needles
peaks
mountains
which
form
its
cortege
and
rise
everywhere
around
it
without
equalling
its
noble
height
carry
the
evident
traces
of
a
slow
wasting
away
illustration
view
of
mont
blanc
from
the
brevent
from
the
excellent
which
we
occupied
we
could
reckon
though
still
imperfectly
the
distance
to
be
gone
over
in
order
to
attain
the
summit
this
summit
which
from
chamonix
appears
so
near
the
dome
of
the
goûter
now
took
its
true
position
the
various
plateaus
which
form
so
many
degrees
which
must
be
crossed
and
which
are
not
visible
from
below
appeared
from
the
brevent
and
threw
the
summit
by
the
laws
of
perspective
still
farther
in
the
background
the
bossons
glacier
in
all
its
splendour
bristled
with
icy
needles
and
blocks
blocks
sometimes
ten
yards
square
which
seemed
like
the
waves
of
an
angry
sea
to
beat
against
the
sides
of
the
rocks
of
the
the
base
of
which
disappeared
in
their
midst
this
marvellous
spectacle
was
not
likely
to
cool
my
impatience
and
i
more
eagerly
than
ever
promised
myself
to
explore
this
hitherto
unknown
world
my
companion
was
equally
inspired
by
the
scene
and
from
this
moment
i
began
to
think
that
i
should
not
have
to
ascend
mont
blanc
alone
we
descended
again
to
chamonix
the
weather
became
milder
every
hour
the
barometer
continued
to
ascend
everything
seemed
to
promise
well
the
next
day
at
sunrise
i
hastened
to
the
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
wind
almost
imperceptible
was
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
the
higher
summits
of
which
were
gilded
by
the
rising
sun
seemed
to
invite
the
many
tourists
to
ascend
it
one
could
not
in
all
politeness
refuse
so
kindly
an
invitation
balmat
after
consulting
his
barometer
declared
the
ascent
to
be
practicable
and
promised
me
the
two
guides
and
the
porter
prescribed
in
our
agreement
i
left
the
selection
of
these
to
him
but
an
unexpected
incident
disturbed
my
preparations
for
departure
as
i
came
out
of
balmat
office
i
met
ravanel
my
guide
of
the
day
before
is
monsieur
going
to
mont
blanc
he
asked
yes
certainly
said
i
is
it
not
a
favourable
time
to
go
he
reflected
a
few
moments
and
then
said
with
an
embarrassed
air
monsieur
you
are
my
traveller
i
accompanied
you
yesterday
to
the
brevent
so
i
can
not
leave
you
now
and
since
you
are
going
up
i
will
go
with
you
if
you
will
kindly
accept
my
services
it
is
your
right
for
on
all
dangerous
journeys
the
traveller
can
choose
his
own
guides
only
if
you
accept
my
offer
i
ask
that
you
will
also
take
my
brother
ambrose
ravanel
and
my
cousin
gaspard
simon
these
are
young
vigorous
fellows
they
do
not
like
the
ascent
of
mont
blanc
better
than
i
do
but
they
will
not
shirk
it
and
i
answer
for
them
to
you
as
i
would
for
myself
this
young
man
inspired
me
with
all
confidence
i
accepted
his
proposition
and
hastened
to
apprise
balmat
of
the
choice
i
had
made
but
balmat
had
meanwhile
been
selecting
guides
for
me
according
to
their
turn
on
his
list
one
only
had
accepted
edward
simon
the
answer
of
another
jean
carrier
had
not
yet
been
received
though
it
was
scarcely
doubtful
as
this
man
had
already
made
the
ascent
of
mont
blanc
times
i
thus
found
myself
in
an
embarrassing
position
the
guides
i
had
chosen
were
all
from
argentière
a
village
six
kilometres
from
chamonix
those
of
chamonix
accused
ravanel
of
having
influenced
me
in
favour
of
his
family
which
was
contrary
to
the
regulations
to
cut
the
discussion
short
i
took
edward
simon
who
had
already
made
his
preparations
as
a
third
guide
he
would
be
useless
if
i
went
up
alone
but
would
become
indispensable
if
my
friend
also
ascended
this
settled
i
went
to
tell
donatien
levesque
i
found
him
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
just
for
he
had
walked
over
sixteen
kilometres
on
a
mountain
the
evening
before
i
had
some
difficulty
in
waking
him
but
on
removing
first
his
sheets
then
his
pillows
and
finally
his
mattress
i
obtained
some
result
and
succeeded
in
making
him
understand
that
i
was
preparing
for
the
hazardous
trip
well
said
he
yawning
i
will
go
with
you
as
far
as
the
and
await
your
return
there
bravo
i
replied
i
have
just
one
guide
too
many
and
i
will
attach
him
to
your
person
we
bought
the
various
articles
indispensable
to
a
journey
across
the
glaciers
alpenstocks
coarse
cloth
leggings
green
spectacles
fitting
tightly
to
the
eyes
furred
gloves
green
veils
nothing
was
forgotten
we
each
had
excellent
shoes
which
our
guides
roughed
for
the
ice
this
last
is
an
important
detail
for
there
are
moments
in
such
an
expedition
when
the
least
slip
is
fatal
not
only
to
yourself
but
to
the
whole
party
with
you
our
preparations
and
those
of
the
guides
occupied
nearly
two
hours
about
eight
our
mules
were
brought
and
we
set
out
at
last
for
the
chalet
of
the
situated
at
a
height
of
six
thousand
five
hundred
feet
or
three
thousand
above
the
valley
of
chamonix
not
far
from
eight
thousand
five
hundred
feet
below
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
on
reaching
the
about
ten
we
found
there
a
spanish
tourist
n
accompanied
by
two
guides
and
a
porter
his
principal
guide
paccard
a
relative
of
the
doctor
paccard
who
made
with
jacques
balmat
the
first
ascent
of
mont
blanc
had
already
been
to
the
summit
eighteen
times
n
was
also
getting
himself
ready
for
the
ascent
he
had
travelled
much
in
america
and
had
crossed
the
cordilleras
to
quito
passing
through
snow
at
the
highest
points
he
therefore
thought
that
he
could
without
great
difficulty
carry
through
his
new
enterprise
but
in
this
he
was
mistaken
he
had
reckoned
without
the
steepness
of
the
inclinations
which
he
had
to
cross
and
the
rarefaction
of
the
air
i
hasten
to
add
to
his
honour
that
since
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
it
was
due
to
a
rare
moral
energy
for
his

together
by
a

colour

succeed
in
looking
into
their

depths

than
to
go

the

plays
its

another
not

awaited
us

we

detached
themselves
and

in

the
trembling
of
the
ground
which
opened
beneath

a
singular
idea
of
those
desolate
places
the
existence

betrays
itself

could
descry

the

farther
off

its
five

overhanging

lastly
mont

gradually
each
of
the
summits
which
overlook
it
on
the
west
the
chain

remained
luminous

seemed
encircled
by
a
golden
halo

the

crept
up

still
respected
the
giant

watched
this
gradual
disappearance
of
the

admiration

lingered
awhile
on
the
highest
summit
and
gave
us
the
foolish
hope
that
it
would
not
depart
thence
but
in
a
few
moments
all
was
shrouded
in
gloom
and
the
livid
and
ghastly
colours
of

succeeded

from
after
witnessing
this
sublime
scene
we
had
only
to
await
the
moment
of
departure
we
were
to
set
out
again
at
two
in
the
morning
now
therefore
we
stretched
ourselves
upon
our
mattresses
it
was
useless
to
think
of
sleeping
much
more
of
talking
we
were
absorbed
by
more
or
less
gloomy
thoughts
it
was
the
night
before
the
battle
with
the
difference
that
nothing
forced
us
to
engage
in
the
struggle
two
sorts
of
ideas
struggled
in
the
mind
it
was
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
sea
each
in
its
turn
objections
to
the
venture
were
not
wanting
why
run
so
much
danger
if
we
succeeded
of
what
advantage
would
it
be
if
an
accident
happened
how
we
should
regret
it
then
the
imagination
set
to
work
all
the
mountain
catastrophes
rose
in
the
fancy
i
dreamed
of
snow
bridges
giving
way
under
my
feet
of
being
precipitated
in
the
yawning
crevasses
of
hearing
the
terrible
noises
of
the
avalanches
detaching
themselves
and
burying
me
of
disappearing
of
cold
and
death
seizing
upon
me
and
of
struggling
with
desperate
effort
but
in
vain
a
sharp
horrible
noise
is
heard
at
this
moment
the
avalanche

avalanche
i
cry
what
is
the
matter
with
you

up
alas
it
is
a
piece
of
furniture
which
in
the
struggles
of
my
nightmare
i
have
just
broken
this
very
prosaic
avalanche
recalls
me
to
the
reality
i
laugh
at
my
terrors
a
contrary
current
of
thought
gets
the
upper
hand
and
with
it
ambitious
ideas
i
need
only
use
a
little
effort
to
reach
this
summit
so
seldom
attained
it
is
a
victory
as
others
are
accidents
are
rare
very
rare
do
they
ever
take
place
at
all
the
spectacle
from
the
summit
must
be
so
marvellous
and
then
what
satisfaction
there
would
be
in
having
accomplished
what
so
many
others
dared
not
undertake
my
courage
was
restored
by
these
thoughts
and
i
calmly
awaited
the
moment
of
departure
about
one
the
steps
and
voices
of
the
guides
and
the
noise
of
opening
doors
indicated
that
that
moment
was
approaching
soon
ravanel
came
in
and
said
come
messieurs
get
up
the
weather
is
magnificent
by
ten
we
shall
be
at
the
summit
at
these
words
we
leaped
from
our
beds
and
hurried
to
make
our
toilet
two
of
the
guides
ambrose
ravanel
and
his
cousin
simon
went
on
ahead
to
explore
the
road
they
were
provided
with
a
lantern
which
was
to
show
us
the
way
to
go
and
with
hatchets
to
make
the
path
and
cut
steps
in
the
very
difficult
spots
at
two
we
tied
ourselves
one
to
another

party
the
guides
and
porters
having
distributed
the
provisions
between
them
the
signal
for
departure
was
given
and
we
set
off
in
the
midst
of
profound
darkness
directing
ourselves
according
to
the
lantern
held
up
at
some
distance
ahead
there
was
something
solemn
in
this
setting
out
but
few
words
were
spoken
the
vagueness
of
the
unknown
impressed
us
but
the
new
and
strange
situation
excited
us
and
rendered
us
insensible
to
its
dangers
the
landscape
around
was
fantastic
but
few
outlines
were
distinguishable
great
white
confused
masses
with
blackish
spots
here
and
there
closed
the
horizon
the
celestial
vault
shone
with
remarkable
brilliancy
we
could
perceive
at
an
uncertain
distance
the
lantern
of
the
guides
who
were
ahead
and
the
mournful
silence
of
the
night
was
only
disturbed
by
the
dry
distant
noise
of
the
hatchet
cutting
steps
in
the
ice
we
crept
slowly
and
cautiously
over
the
first
ascent
going
towards
the
base
of
the
goûter
after
ascending
laboriously
for
two
hours
we
reached
the
first
plateau
called
the
at
the
foot
of
the
goûter
at
a
height
of
about
eleven
thousand
feet
we
rested
a
few
moments
and
then
proceeded
turning
now
to
the
left
and
going
towards
the
edge
which
conducts
to
the
but
our
party
had
already
lessened
in
number
n
with
his
guides
had
stopped
his
fatigue
obliged
him
to
take
a
longer
rest
about
four
dawn
began
to
whiten
the
horizon
at
this
moment
we
were
ascending
the
slope
which
leads
to
the
which
we
soon
safely
reached
we
were
eleven
thousand
eight
hundred
feet
high
we
had
well
earned
our
breakfast
wonderful
to
relate
levesque
and
i
had
a
good
appetite
it
was
a
good
sign
we
therefore
installed
ourselves
on
the
snow
and
made
such
a
repast
as
we
could
our
guides
joyfully
declared
that
success
was
certain
as
for
me
i
thought
they
resumed
work
too
quickly
n
rejoined
us
before
long
we
urged
him
to
take
some
nourishment
he
peremptorily
refused
he
felt
the
contraction
of
the
stomach
which
is
so
common
in
those
parts
and
was
almost
broken

a
special
description

this
immense

of
glittering
whiteness
on

was
in

of
these

three
of

who
accompanied

and
colonel
anderson
in
were
swallowed
up
in
another
guide

his
death
there
this
plateau
must
be
crossed
with
great
caution
as
the
crevasses
are
often
hidden
by
the
snow
besides
it
is
often
swept
by
avalanches
on
the
of
october
an
english
traveller
and
three
of
his
guides
were
buried
under
a
mass
of
ice
that
fell
from
mont
blanc
after
a
perilous
search
the
bodies
of
the
three
guides
were
found
they
were
expecting
every
moment
to
find
that
of
the
englishman
when
a
fresh
avalanche
fell
upon
the
first
and
forced
the
searchers
to
abandon
their
task
illustration
crossing
the
plateau
three
routes
presented
themselves
to
us
the
ordinary
route
which
passes
entirely
to
the
left
by
the
base
of
mont
maudit
through
a
sort
of
valley
called
the
corridor
leads
by
gentle
ascents
to
the
top
of
the
first
escarpment
of
the
rouges
rocks
the
second
less
frequented
turns
to
the
right
by
the
goûter
and
leads
to
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
by
the
ridge
which
unites
these
two
mountains
you
must
pursue
for
three
hours
a
giddy
path
and
scale
a
height
of
moving
ice
called
the
hump
the
third
route
consists
in
ascending
directly
to
the
summit
of
the
corridor
crossing
an
seven
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
which
extends
along
the
first
escarpment
of
the
rouges
rocks
the
guides
declared
the
first
route
impracticable
on
account
of
the
recent
crevasses
which
entirely
obstructed
it
the
choice
between
the
two
others
remained
i
thought
the
second
by
the
camel
hump
the
best
but
it
was
regarded
as
too
dangerous
and
it
was
decided
that
we
should
attack
the
conducting
to
the
summit
of
the
corridor
when
a
decision
is
made
it
is
best
to
execute
it
without
delay
we
crossed
the
and
reached
the
foot
of
this
really
formidable
obstacle
the
nearer
we
approached
the
more
nearly
vertical
became
its
slope
besides
several
crevasses
which
we
had
not
perceived
yawned
at
its
base
we
nevertheless
began
the
difficult
ascent
steps
were
begun
by
the
foremost
guide
and
completed
by
the
next
we
ascended
two
steps
a
minute
the
higher
we
went
the
more
the
steepness
increased
our
guides
themselves
discussed
what
route
to
follow
they
spoke
in
patois
and
did
not
always
agree
which
was
not
a
good
sign
at
last
the
slope
became
such
that
our
hats
touched
the
legs
of
the
guide
just
before
us
a
hailstorm
of
pieces
of
ice
produced
by
the
cutting
of
the
steps
blinded
us
and
made
our
progress
still
more
difficult
addressing
one
of
the
foremost
guides
i
said
ah
it
very
well
going
up
this
way
it
is
not
an
open
road
i
admit
still
it
is
practicable
only
how
are
you
going
to
get
us
down
again
o
monsieur
replied
ambrose
ravanel
we
will
take
another
route
going
back
at
last
after
violent
effort
for
two
hours
and
after
having
cut
more
than
four
hundred
steps
in
this
terrible
mass
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
corridor
completely
exhausted
we
then
crossed
a
slightly
sloping
plateau
of
snow
and
passed
along
the
side
of
an
immense
crevasse
which
obstructed
our
way
we
had
scarcely
turned
it
when
we
uttered
a
cry
of
admiration
on
the
right
piedmont
and
the
plains
of
lombardy
were
at
our
feet
on
the
left
the
pennine
alps
and
the
oberland
crowned
with
snow
raised
their
magnificent
crests
monte
rosa
and
the
cervin
alone
still
rose
above
us
but
soon
we
should
overlook
them
in
our
turn
this
reflection
recalled
us
to
the
end
of
our
expedition
we
turned
our
gaze
towards
mont
blanc
and
stood
stupefied
heavens
how
far
off
it
is
still
cried
levesque
and
how
high
i
added
it
was
a
discouraging
sight
the
famous
wall
of
the
ridge
so
much
feared
but
which
must
be
crossed
was
before
us
with
its
slope
of
fifty
degrees
but
after
scaling
the
wall
of
the
corridor
it
did
not
terrify
us
we
rested
for
half
an
hour
and
then
continued
our
tramp
but
we
soon
perceived
that
the
atmospheric
conditions
were
no
longer
the
same
the
sun
shed
his
warm
rays
upon
us
and
their
reflection
on
the
snow
added
to
our
discomfort
the
rarefaction
of
the
air
began
to
be
severely
felt
we
advanced
slowly
making
frequent
halts
and
at
last
reached
the
plateau
which
overlooks
the
second
escarpment
of
the
rouges
rocks
we
were
at
the
foot
of
mont
blanc
it
rose
alone
and
majestic
at
a
height
of
six
hundred
feet
above
us
monte
rosa
itself
had
lowered
its
flag
levesque
and
i
were
completely
exhausted
as
for
n
who
had
rejoined
us
at
the
summit
of
the
corridor
it
might
be
said
that
he
was
insensible
to
the
rarefaction
of
the
air
for
he
no
longer
breathed
so
to
speak
we
began
at
last
to
scale
the
last
stage
we
made
ten
steps
and
then
stopped
finding
it
absolutely
impossible
to
proceed
a
painful
contraction
of
the
throat
made
our
breathing
exceedingly
difficult
our
legs
refused
to
carry
us
and
i
then
understood
the
picturesque
expression
of
jacques
balmat
when
in
narrating
his
first
ascent
he
said
that
his
legs
seemed
only
to
be
kept
up
by
his
trousers
but
our
mental
was
superior
to
our
physical
force
and
if
the
body
faltered
the
heart
responding
excelsior
stifled
its
desperate
complaint
and
urged
forward
our
poor
mechanism
despite
itself
we
thus
passed
the
and
after
two
hours
of
superhuman
efforts
finally
overlooked
the
entire
chain
mont
blanc
was
under
our
feet
illustration
summit
of
mont
blanc
it
was
fifteen
minutes
after
twelve
the
pride
of
success
soon
dissipated
our
fatigue
we
had
at
last
conquered
this
formidable
crest
we
overlooked
all
the
others
and
the
thoughts
which
mont
blanc
alone
can
inspire
affected
us
with
a
deep
emotion
it
was
ambition
satisfied
and
to
me
at
least
a
dream
realized
mont
blanc
is
the
highest
mountain
in
europe
several
mountains
in
asia
and
america
are
higher
but
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
attempt
them
if
in
the
absolute
impossibility
of
reaching
their
summit
you
must
be
content
to
remain
at
a
lesser
height
others
such
as
mont
cervin
are
more
difficult
of
access
but
we
perceived
the
summit
of
mont
cervin
twelve
hundred
feet
below
us
and
then
what
a
view
to
reward
us
for
our
troubles
and
dangers
the
sky
still
pure
had
assumed
a
tint
the
sun
despoiled
of
a
part
of
his
rays
had
lost
his
brilliancy
as
if
in
a
partial
eclipse
this
effect
due
to
the
rarefaction
of
the
air
was
all
the
more
apparent
as
the
surrounding
eminences
and
plains
were
inundated
with
light
no
detail
of
the
scene
therefore
escaped
our
notice
in
the
the
mountains
of
piedmont
and
farther
off
the
plains
of
lombardy
shut
in
our
horizon
towards
the
west
the
mountains
of
savoy
and
dauphiné
beyond
the
valley
of
the
rhone
in
the
the
lake
of
geneva
and
the
jura
then
descending
towards
the
south
a
chaos
of
mountains
and
glaciers
beyond
description
overlooked
by
the
masses
of
monte
rosa
the
mischabelhoerner
the
cervin
the
weishorn
the
most
beautiful
of
crests
as
tyndall
calls
it
and
farther
off
by
the
jungfrau
the
monck
the
eiger
and
the
finsteraarhorn
the
extent
of
our
range
of
vision
was
not
less
than
sixty
leagues
we
therefore
saw
at
least
one
hundred
and
twenty
leagues
of
country
a
special
circumstance
happened
to
enhance
the
beauty
of
the
scene
clouds
formed
on
the
italian
side
and
invaded
the
valleys
of
the
pennine
alps
without
veiling
their
summits
we
soon
had
under
our
eyes
a
second
sky
a
lower
sky
a
sea
of
clouds
whence
emerged
a
perfect
archipelago
of
peaks
and
mountains
there
was
something
magical
in
it
which
the
greatest
poets
could
scarcely
describe
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
forms
a
ridge
from
southwest
to
two
hundred
paces
long
and
a
yard
wide
at
the
culminating
point
it
seemed
like
a
ship
hull
overturned
the
keel
in
the
air
strangely
enough
the
temperature
was
very
high
ten
degrees
above
zero
the
air
was
almost
still
sometimes
we
felt
a
light
breeze
the
first
care
of
our
guides
was
to
place
us
all
in
a
line
on
the
crest
opposite
chamonix
that
we
might
be
easily
counted
from
below
and
thus
make
it
known
that
no
one
of
us
had
been
lost
many
of
the
tourists
had
ascended
the
brevent
and
the
jardin
to
watch
our
ascent
they
might
now
be
assured
of
its
success
but
to
ascend
was
not
all
we
must
think
also
of
going
down
the
most
difficult
if
not
most
wearisome
task
remained
and
then
one
quits
with
regret
a
summit
attained
at
the
price
of
so
much
toil
the
energy
which
urges
you
to
ascend
the
need
so
natural
and
imperious
of
overcoming
now
fails
you
you
go
forward
listlessly
often
looking
behind
you
it
was
necessary
however
to
decide
and
after
a
last
traditional
libation
of
champagne
we
put
ourselves
in
motion
we
had
remained
on
the
summit
an
hour
the
order
of
march
was
now
changed
n
party
led
off
and
at
the
suggestion
of
his
guide
paccard
we
were
all
tied
together
with
a
rope
n
fatigue
which
his
strength
but
not
his
will
betrayed
made
us
fear
falls
on
his
part
which
would
require
the
help
of
the
whole
party
to
arrest
the
event
justified
our
foreboding
on
descending
the
side
of
the
wall
n
made
several
false
steps
his
guides
very
vigorous
and
skilful
were
happily
able
to
check
him
but
ours
feeling
with
reason
that
the
whole
party
might
be
dragged
down
wished
to
detach
us
from
the
rope
levesque
and
i
opposed
this
and
by
taking
great
precautions
we
safely
reached
the
base
of
this
giddy
ledge
there
was
no
room
for
illusions
the
almost
bottomless
abyss
was
before
us
and
the
pieces
of
detached
ice
which
bounded
by
us
with
the
rapidity
of
an
arrow
clearly
showed
us
the
route
which
the
party
would
take
if
a
slip
were
made
once
this
terrible
gap
crossed
i
began
to
breathe
again
we
descended
the
gradual
slopes
which
led
to
the
summit
of
the
corridor
the
snow
softened
by
the
heat
yielded
beneath
our
feet
we
sank
in
it
to
the
knees
which
made
our
progress
very
fatiguing
we
steadily
followed
the
path
by
which
we
ascended
in
the
morning
and
i
was
astonished
when
gaspard
simon
turning
towards
me
said
monsieur
we
can
not
take
any
other
road
for
the
corridor
is
impracticable
and
we
must
descend
by
the
wall
which
we
climbed
up
this
morning
i
told
levesque
this
disagreeable
news
only
added
gaspard
simon
i
do
not
think
we
can
all
remain
tied
together
however
we
will
see
how
n
bears
it
at
first
we
advanced
towards
this
terrible
wall
n
party
began
to
descend
and
we
heard
paccard
talking
rapidly
to
him
the
inclination
became
so
steep
that
we
perceived
neither
him
nor
his
guides
though
we
were
bound
together
by
the
same
rope
as
soon
as
gaspard
simon
who
went
before
me
could
comprehend
what
was
passing
he
stopped
and
after
exchanging
some
words
in
with
his
comrades
declared
that
we
must
detach
ourselves
from
n
party
we
are
responsible
for
you
he
added
but
we
can
not
be
responsible
for
others
and
if
they
slip
they
will
drag
us
after
them
saying
this
he
got
loose
from
the
rope
we
were
very
unwilling
to
take
this
step
but
our
guides
were
inflexible
we
then
proposed
to
send
two
of
them
to
help
n
guides
they
eagerly
consented
but
having
no
rope
they
could
not
put
this
plan
into
execution
we
then
began
this
terrible
descent
only
one
of
us
moved
at
a
time
and
when
each
took
a
step
the
others
buttressed
themselves
ready
to
sustain
the
shock
if
he
slipped
the
foremost
guide
edward
ravanel
had
the
most
perilous
task
it
was
for
him
to
make
the
steps
over
again
now
more
or
less
worn
away
by
the
ascending
caravan
we
progressed
slowly
taking
the
most
careful
precautions
our
route
led
us
in
a
right
line
to
one
of
the
crevasses
which
opened
at
the
base
of
the
escarpment
when
we
were
going
up
we
could
not
look
at
this
crevasse
but
in
descending
we
were
fascinated
by
its
green
and
yawning
sides
all
the
blocks
of
ice
detached
by
our
passage
went
the
same
way
and
after
two
or
three
bounds
ingulfed
themselves
in
the
crevasse
as
in
the
jaws
of
the
minotaur
only
the
jaws
of
the
minotaur
closed
after
each
morsel
while
the
unsatiated
crevasse
yawned
perpetually
and
seemed
to
await
before
closing
a
larger
mouthful
it
was
for
us
to
take
care
that
we
should
not
be
this
mouthful
and
all
our
efforts
were
made
for
this
end
in
order
to
withdraw
ourselves
from
this
fascination
this
moral
giddiness
if
i
may
so
express
myself
we
tried
to
joke
about
the
dangerous
position
in
which
we
found
ourselves
and
which
even
a
chamois
would
not
have
envied
us
we
even
got
so
far
as
to
hum
one
of
offenbach
couplets
but
i
must
confess
that
our
jokes
were
feeble
and
that
we
did
not
sing
the
airs
correctly
i
even
thought
i
discovered
levesque
obstinately
setting
the
words
of
to
one
of
the
airs
in
il
trovatore
which
rather
indicated
some
grave
preoccupation
of
the
mind
in
short
in
order
to
keep
up
our
spirits
we
did
as
do
those
brave
cowards
who
sing
in
the
dark
to
forget
their
fright
we
remained
thus
suspended
between
life
and
death
for
an
hour
which
seemed
an
eternity
at
last
we
reached
the
bottom
of
this
terrible
escarpment
we
there
found
n
and
his
party
safe
and
sound
after
resting
a
little
while
we
continued
our
journey
as
we
were
approaching
the
edward
ravanel
suddenly
stopped
and
turning
towards
us
said
see
what
an
avalanche
it
has
covered
our
tracks
an
immense
avalanche
of
ice
had
indeed
fallen
from
the
goûter
and
entirely
buried
the
path
we
had
followed
in
the
morning
across
the
i
estimated
that
the
mass
of
this
avalanche
could
not
comprise
less
than
five
hundred
cubic
yards
if
it
had
fallen
while
we
were
passing
one
more
catastrophe
would
no
doubt
have
been
added
to
the
list
already
too
long
of
the
necrology
of
mont
blanc
this
fresh
obstacle
forced
us
to
seek
a
new
road
or
to
pass
around
the
foot
of
the
avalanche
as
we
were
much
fatigued
the
latter
course
was
assuredly
the
simplest
but
it
involved
a
serious
danger
a
wall
of
ice
more
than
sixty
feet
high
already
partly
detached
from
the
goûter
to
which
it
only
clung
by
one
of
its
angles
overhung
the
path
which
we
should
follow
this
great
mass
seemed
to
hold
itself
in
equilibrium
what
if
our
passing
by
disturbing
the
air
should
hasten
its
fall
our
guides
held
a
consultation
each
of
them
examined
with
a
the
fissure
which
had
been
formed
between
the
mountain
and
this
alarming
the
sharp
and
clear
edges
of
the
cleft
betrayed
a
recent
breaking
off
evidently
caused
by
the
fall
of
the
avalanche
after
a
brief
discussion
our
guides
recognizing
the
impossibility
of
finding
another
road
decided
to
attempt
this
dangerous
passage
we
must
walk
very
fast
even
run
if
possible
said
they
and
we
shall
be
in
safety
in
five
minutes
come
messieurs
a
last
effort
a
run
of
five
minutes
is
a
small
matter
for
people
who
are
only
tired
but
for
us
who
were
absolutely
exhausted
to
run
even
for
so
short
a
time
on
soft
snow
in
which
we
sank
up
to
the
knees
seemed
an
impossibility
nevertheless
we
made
an
urgent
appeal
to
our
energies
and
after
two
or
three
tumbles
drawn
forward
by
one
pushed
by
another
we
finally
reached
a
snow
hillock
on
which
we
fell
breathless
we
were
out
of
danger
it
required
some
time
to
recover
ourselves
we
stretched
out
on
the
snow
with
a
feeling
of
comfort
which
every
one
will
understand
the
greatest
difficulties
had
been
surmounted
and
though
there
were
still
dangers
to
brave
we
could
confront
them
with
comparatively
little
apprehension
we
prolonged
our
halt
in
the
hope
of
witnessing
the
fall
of
the
avalanche
but
in
vain
as
the
day
was
advancing
and
it
was
not
prudent
to
tarry
in
these
icy
solitudes
we
decided
to
continue
on
our
way
and
about
five
we
reached
the
hut
of
the
after
a
bad
night
attended
by
fever
caused
by
the
sunstrokes
encountered
in
our
expedition
we
made
ready
to
return
to
chamonix
but
before
setting
out
we
inscribed
the
names
of
our
guides
and
the
principal
events
of
our
journey
according
to
the
custom
on
the
register
kept
for
this
purpose
at
the
about
eight
we
started
for
chamonix
the
passage
of
the
bossons
was
difficult
but
we
accomplished
it
without
accident
illustration
party
descending
from
the
hut
half
an
hour
before
reaching
chamonix
we
met
at
the
chalet
of
the
dard
falls
some
english
tourists
who
seemed
to
be
watching
our
progress
when
they
perceived
us
they
hurried
up
eagerly
to
congratulate
us
on
our
success
one
of
them
presented
us
to
his
wife
a
charming
person
with
a
air
after
we
had
given
them
a
sketch
of
our
perilous
peregrinations
she
said
to
us
in
earnest
accents
how
much
you
are
envied
here
by
everybody
let
me
touch
your
alpenstocks
these
words
seemed
to
interpret
the
general
feeling
the
ascent
of
mont
blanc
is
a
very
painful
one
it
is
asserted
that
the
celebrated
naturalist
of
geneva
de
saussure
acquired
there
the
seeds
of
the
disease
of
which
he
died
in
a
few
months
after
his
return
from
the
summit
i
can
not
better
close
this
narrative
than
by
quoting
the
words
of
markham
sherwell
however
it
may
be
he
says
in
describing
his
ascent
of
mont
blanc
i
would
not
advise
any
one
to
undertake
this
ascent
the
rewards
of
which
can
never
have
an
importance
proportionate
to
the
dangers
encountered
by
the
tourist
and
by
those
who
accompany
him
