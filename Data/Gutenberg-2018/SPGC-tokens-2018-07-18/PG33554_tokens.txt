nancy
checking
off
the
items
in
her
marketing
list
looked
over
toward
her
sister
who
had
wandered
to
the
door
and
stood
gazing
out
into
the
street
where
a
gentle
september
rain
was
falling
alma
did
not
answer
seeming
to
have
gone
into
a
dream
and
the
grocer
waited
patiently
his
pencil
poised
over
his
pad
alma
do
wake
up
have
i
forgotten
anything
i
sure
there
was
something
else
said
nancy
frowning
and
studying
her
list
with
her
under
lip
thrust
forward
i
regularly
go
and
forget
something
every
saturday
night
when
there
no
hannah
to
concoct
something
out
of
nothing
for
sunday
luncheon
you
said
you
were
going
to
bake
a
cake
a
chocolate
layer
cake
suggested
alma
turning
and
viewing
the
proceeding
disinterestedly
with
her
hands
in
her
pockets
that
it
i
have
to
get
flour
and
some
cooking
chocolate
and
vanilla
alma
you
got
to
help
me

these
things
i
not
goliath
mercy
nancy
we
do
have
to
take
all
that
home
with
us
do
we
ca
you
send
them
mr
simpson
the
grocer
shrugged
apologetically
it
saturday
miss
prescott
and
the
last
delivery
went
out
at
three
all
my
boys
have
gone
home
now
or
i
try
to
accommodate
you
i
do
hate
to
go
about
looking
like
an
old
market
woman
with
my
arms
full
of
brown
paper
parcels
murmured
alma
to
her
sister
goodness
i
do
imagine
there
be
a
grand
stand
along
the
way
with
thousands
watching
us
through
opera
glasses
laughed
nancy
would
you
mind
telling
me
whom
you
expect
to
meet
who
faint
with
genteel
horror
because
we
take
home
our
sunday
dinner
i
do
intend
to
starve
to
spare
anybody
feelings
last
week
i
was
dragging
along
a
bag
of
potatoes
and
and
i
met
frank
barrows
and
the
bag
split
while
i
was
talking
to
him
and
those
hateful
potatoes
went
bumping
around
all
over
the
pavement
i
never
was
so
mortified
in
my
life
said
alma
sulkily
nancy
shot
a
keen
glance
at
her
sister
pretty
face
and
her
eyes
twinkled
alma
shortage
of
the
american
commodity
called
humor
was
a
source
of
continual
quiet
joy
to
nancy
who
was
the
only
member
of
the
prescott
family
with
the
endowment
of
that
gift
dear
me
whatever
did
frank
do
scream
and
cover
his
eyes
from
the
awful
sight
had
he
never
seen
a
raw
potato
in
all
his
sheltered
young
life
alma
shrugged
her
shoulders
a
slight
gesture
with
which
she
and
her
mother
were
wont
to
express
their
hopeless
realization
of
nancy
lack
of
finer
feelings
i
do
suppose
you
would
have
minded
it
but
hate
to
look
ridiculous
particularly
before
anyone
like
frank
barrows
but
alma
you
funny
girl
do
you
see
that
you
look
a
thousand
times
more
ridiculous
when
you
act
as
if
a
few
potatoes
bouncing
about
were
something
serious
do
tell
me
you
stood
there
gazing
off
haughtily
into
the
blue
distance
while
frank
gathered
up
your
silly
old
potatoes
or
did
you
disown
them
or
did
you
play
elizabeth
and
expect
a
miracle
to
turn
them
into
roses
so
that
they
would
be
less
offensive
to
frank
aristocratic
eyes
come
on
now
help
me
shoulder
our
provisions
we
members
of
the
swiss
family
robinson
going
back
to
our
hut
with
our
spoils
pretend
we
savages
and
this
is
a
desert
island
and
not
respectable
melbrook
at
all
next
time
we
go
marketing
you
can
disguise
yourself
with
a
beard
and
blue
goggles
alma
laughed
unwillingly
she
was
a
dainty
and
singularly
pretty
girl
a
little
bit
foolish
and
a
good
bit
of
a
snob
but
nancy
adored
her
though
she
enjoyed
making
digs
at
alma
weak
spots
they
took
up
their
bundles
said
to
simpson
and
went
out
it
was
a
walk
of
three
miles
from
the
village
or
as
it
preferred
to
be
called
the
town
of
melbrook
to
the
prescotts
house
which
lay
in
the
country
beyond
a
modest
little
nest
enough
where
the
two
girls
had
grown
up
almost
isolated
by
their
poverty
from
the
gay
life
of
the
younger
melbrookians
alma
chafed
unhappily
against
this
isolation
chafed
against
every
reminder
of
their
poverty
and
like
her
mother
once
a
beauty
and
a
belle
craved
the
excitement
of
admiration
luxury
and
fine
things
she
was
ashamed
of
the
little
house
which
was
shabby
it
is
true
ashamed
of
having
to
wear
old
clothes
and
made
herself
wretched
by
envying
the
richer
girls
of
the
neighborhood
their
beautiful
houses
their
horses
and
their
endless
round
of
gay
times
as
nancy
once
told
her
mother
in
affectionate
reproof
they
were
always
trying
to
play
rich
prescott
and
alma
she
had
tried
to
teach
alma
her
own
secret
of
finding
life
pleasant
but
alma
did
not
love
books
nor
long
solitary
walks
through
the
summer
woods
and
nancy
ambition
of
fitting
herself
to
meet
the
world
and
make
her
own
living
seemed
to
both
alma
and
her
mother
dreary
and
unfeminine
somewhere
in
the
back
of
her
pretty
head
prescott
cherished
the
hope
and
the
belief
that
the
two
girls
would
find
some
way
of
coming
into
what
she
called
their
own
not
by
nancy
independent
plan
of
action
but
through
some
easier
pleasanter
course
she
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
their
making
their
own
living
and
opposed
nancy
wish
to
go
to
college
on
the
ground
that
no
men
liked
women
and
that
therefore
nancy
would
be
an
old
maid
but
mother
darling
we
ca
just
sit
back
and
wait
for
some
young
millionaire
to
come
and
carry
us
off
nancy
would
plead
shaking
her
head
time
was
flying
and
nancy
was
seventeen
and
eager
to
begin
her
own
life
let
me
go
i
can
work
my
way
through
and
alma
can
stay
at
home
with
you
i
need
you
to
help
me
with
alma
was
prescott
answer
nancy
felt
helpless
her
father
before
her
had
to
his
sorrow
recognized
the
hopelessness
of
driving
any
views
into
pretty
silly
little
head
she
had
never
realized
that
the
decline
of
the
family
fortune
had
been
in
no
small
measure
due
to
her
she
accounted
for
it
on
the
grounds
of
old
thomas
prescott
inhuman
stubbornness
and
selfishness
the
two
girls
leaving
the
village
behind
them
were
walking
briskly
through
the
rain
down
the
main
road
bordered
by
the
imposing
country
estates
of
people
who
had
gradually
settled
on
the
pretty
countryside
nancy
could
remember
when
the
hill
where
now
stood
a
staring
white
stone
mansion
surrounded
by
lawns
and
trim
gardens
had
been
a
wild
lovely
swell
of
meadow
dotted
with
clusters
of
oaks
and
elms
when
in
place
of
the
smug
little
bungalow
with
its
artificial
pond
and
waterfall
and
ornate
stone
fences
there
had
been
a
wooded
copse
where
squirrels
scuttled
about
among
branches
of
trees
since
fallen
in
the
path
of
a
moneyed
civilization
other
of
the
houses
of
haughty
mansard
architecture
had
stood
there
before
she
had
been
born
and
it
had
often
seemed
to
her
that
the
huge
solemn
beautiful
old
place
of
thomas
prescott
had
been
there
since
the
creation
as
they
passed
it
they
slackened
their
pace
and
despite
the
weight
of
bundles
which
grew
heavier
every
minute
stopped
and
peered
through
the
bars
of
the
great
gates
a
broad
drive
meticulously
raked
and
weeded
wound
away
from
them
under
magnificent
arching
trees
to
the
portals
nancy
said
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
consider
uncle
thomas
door
anything
but
a
portal
which
were
just
visible
under
the
branches
the
rest
of
the
old
stone
house
was
screened
from
the
rude
gaze
of
prying
eyes
like
the
face
of
a
faded
dowager
of
the
harem
save
for
the
upper
half
of
a
massive
norman
tower
which
thrust
itself
up
out
of
the
nest
of
green
leaves
like
the
neck
of
some
inquisitive
prehistoric
bird
i
do
believe
uncle
thomas
has
passed
through
these
gates
in
fifteen
years
said
nancy
one
could
almost
believe
that
he
had
really
died
and
had
had
himself
buried
on
the
grounds
like
the
eccentric
old
recluse
he
is
well
they
would
have
had
to
have
done
something
with
all
his
money
replied
alma
pressing
her
forehead
against
the
iron
bars
unless
he
left
everything
to
his
butler
and
had
the
will
read
in
secret
it
would
be
just
like
him
oh
nancy
why
are
there
such
selfish
old
misers
in
the
world
just
think
if
he
just
give
us
the
least
little
bit
of
all
his
money
just
enough
to
get
a
horse
and
carriage
and
buy
some
nice
clothes
and
and
get
a
pretty
house
it
would
be
anything
to
him
mamma
says
she
is
sure
that
he
will
relent
some
day
nancy
shrugged
her
shoulders
to
her
mind
it
was
foolish
of
her
mother
to
put
any
hopes
on
the
whims
of
an
old
eccentric
prescott
was
one
of
those
poor
optimists
who
believe
earnestly
in
the
miracles
of
chance
always
forgetting
that
chance
works
its
miracles
as
a
rule
only
when
the
way
has
been
prepared
for
them
by
the
plodding
labor
of
common
sense
we
must
count
on
that
alma
she
said
soberly
there
is
no
use
in
living
on
the
possibility
that
uncle
thomas
will
relent
and
make
us
rich
it
is
just
for
the
pure
love
of
money
that
he
has
been
so
stingy
toward
us
i
believe
he
was
never
a
miser
toward
father
you
know
i
i
think
he
would
have
given
us
everything
in
the
world
if
if
she
hesitated
unwilling
to
state
her
private
opinion
to
alma
if
what
well
you
see
i
think
the
trouble
was
this
come
along
we
wait
here
or
you
catch
cold
what
do
you
think
the
trouble
was
prompted
alma
padding
after
her
sister
and
sloshing
placidly
through
the
puddles
in
all
the
nonchalant
confidence
of
sound
rubbers
well
alma
you
must
misunderstand
me
i
afraid
you
will
you
know
how
i
adore
mother
she
so
pretty
and
and
childlike
and
funny
that
nobody
on
earth
could
ever
blame
her
blame
her
for
what
cried
alma
with
sudden
fire
nothing
only
alma
we
must
realize
that
sometimes
mother
makes
little
mistakes
and
i
believe
that
she
has
had
to
pay
more
heavily
for
them
than
she
deserves
we
got
to
try
to
protect
her
against
them
by
looking
at
life
squarely
and
wisely
alma
are
you
going
to
preach
a
sermon
what
were
you
going
to
say
about
uncle
thomas
just
this
you
know
uncle
thomas
was
a
very
clever
man
he
made
every
bit
of
his
money
himself
father
told
me
long
ago
that
when
uncle
thomas
began
in
life
he
did
not
have
a
cent
in
the
world
he
started
out
as
a
plain
and
then
he
became
a
mechanic
and
he
worked
his
way
up
from
one
rung
to
another
until
through
his
own
talent
and
pluck
he
became
very
very
rich
well
it
only
natural
that
a
man
like
that
should
give
money
its
full
value
when
he
toiled
for
years
at
so
many
cents
an
hour
he
knows
just
exactly
how
many
cents
there
are
in
a
dollar
perhaps
he
puts
too
great
a
value
upon
it
but
certainly
we
are
judges
of
that
you
know
that
uncle
thomas
never
married
and
when
grandfather
died
uncle
thomas
became
guardian
i
believe
he
loved
father
better
than
anyone
in
the
world
who
could
help
it
nancy
voice
trembled
slightly
and
she
winked
back
the
tears
which
rose
to
her
eyes
at
the
memory
of
her
handsome
merry
face
which
had
grown
so
unaccountably
saddened
and
worn
before
his
early
death
he
gave
father
everything
he
wanted
when
he
was
a
boy
you
know
how
daddy
used
to
tell
us
how
uncle
thomas
would
tiptoe
up
to
his
room
at
night
and
slip
gold
pieces
into
his
stocking
so
that
he
could
find
them
in
the
morning
and
then
when
daddy
asked
him
about
it
he
would
shrug
his
shoulders
and
his
eyes
would
twinkle
and
he
say
must
have
been
brownies
i
ca
imagine
how
a
man
who
used
to
be
like
that
could
ever
have
grown
so
hard
and
bitter
said
alma
well
then
you
see
when
father
grew
up
uncle
wanted
him
to
be
successful
for
himself
and
he
was
terribly
proud
of
father
when
daddy
first
came
back
and
told
him
that
he
had
made
five
thousand
dollars
in
his
first
year
at
business
then
father
told
him
that
he
was
going
to
be
married
uncle
did
want
him
to
not
until
he
had
definitely
settled
himself
in
life
and
then
father
was
very
young
and
mother
only
a
girl
of
seventeen
think
of
it
just
my
age
but
when
uncle
saw
mother
he
adored
her
of
course
nancy
paused
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
rest
of
her
story
but
alma
prompted
her
curiously
she
had
never
heard
this
tale
before
for
nancy
had
gleaned
it
bit
by
bit
from
her
father
when
they
used
to
take
long
walks
together
through
the
country
and
putting
two
and
two
together
she
had
been
able
to
get
rather
close
to
the
real
truth
of
things
i
know
uncle
adored
mother
said
alma
kicking
through
a
pile
of
wet
leaves
he
gave
her
those
lovely
italian
earrings
which
i
to
have
when
i
eighteen
and
all
that
wonderful
venetian
lace
which
the
first
one
of
us
to
be
married
is
going
to
have
for
her
wedding
gown
yes
well
then
then
after
father
and
mother
were
married
things
did
go
so
very
well
mother
was
just
a
girl
just
my
age
you
know
only
she
was
pretty
like
you
and
i
suppose
a
little
extravagant
at
least
they
were
able
to
make
ends
meet
very
well
although
daddy
made
a
good
income
and
anyhow
uncle
thomas
would
have
thought
her
extravagant
he
did
see
why
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
send
for
her
clothes
to
paris
and
why
father
was
always
worried
about
bills
when
he
should
have
been
able
to
live
well
within
his
income
anyway
father
was
able
to
save
a
cent
and
one
day
uncle
thomas
came
to
him
and
said
that
he
had
a
very
good
opportunity
for
him
to
invest
his
savings
so
that
they
would
draw
a
much
better
income
than
what
they
were
giving
the
only
trouble
was
that
father
did
have
any
savings
then
uncle
became
furious
he
asked
father
and
mother
what
kind
of
future
they
thought
they
were
laying
up
for
us
and
he
scolded
mother
terribly
for
not
helping
father
he
quoted
the
bible
about
women
being
the
helpmeet
of
their
husbands
and
about
the
parents
eating
sour
grapes
and
setting
the
children
teeth
on
edge
he
said
that
they
were
taking
the
path
to
ruin
and
that
father
could
expect
no
help
from
him
unless
he
and
mother
economized
but
you
see
poor
mother
always
considered
paris
dresses
and
jewellery
and
expensive
dainties
the
necessities
and
not
just
the
luxuries
of
life
i
do
suppose
she
really
understood
how
to
economize
at
all
and
anyway
things
got
worse
instead
of
better
then
one
year
daddy
lost
an
awful
lot
of
money
trying
to
make
some
quickly
so
that
he
could
get
his
debts
cleared
up
and
start
fresh
instead
he
only
got
in
deeper
and
and
then
he
fell
and
you
remember
alma
when
poor
father
was
dying
uncle
came
and
he
cried
and
cried
but
when
mother
came
into
the
room
he
got
up
and
went
out
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
then
he
shut
the
gates
of
his
house
against
us
too
i
think
he
feels
that
we
we
girls
must
learn
to
look
at
life
seriously
to
work
out
our
own
futures
so
that
poverty
will
teach
us
to
be
wiser
than
than
poor
darling
little
mother
nancy
voice
had
sunk
as
if
she
were
talking
to
herself
so
that
alma
barely
heard
the
last
words
she
was
thinking
of
alma
wondering
how
she
could
teach
her
little
sister
to
see
life
practically
without
taking
away
the
joy
of
it
from
her
we
must
rely
on
uncle
thomas
alma
she
said
presently
we
must
count
on
anything
but
what
we
can
do
for
ourselves
remember
that
dear
we
got
to
realize
that
our
lives
must
run
a
different
course
from
those
of
richer
girls
we
can
never
do
the
things
they
do
but
surely
they
will
be
richer
lives
and
happier
lives
if
if
we
rely
on
no
one
ask
nothing
from
anyone
but
what
we
earn
her
head
went
up
never
struggle
for
or
want
the
things
that
lie
beyond
our
means
but
make
always
the
opportunities
that
lie
within
our
grasp
or
ones
that
we
can
make
for
serve
as
stepping
stones
alma
glanced
at
her
sister
sober
handsome
face
there
were
times
when
nancy
looked
to
her
like
some
brave
gallant
sturdy
lad
and
there
were
times
when
she
agreed
with
nancy
in
spite
of
herself
and
against
her
own
inclinations
here
we
are
home
again
and
if
it
is
the
snuggest
cosiest
most
cheerful
burrow
between
here
and
melbrook
why
nancy
strode
gaily
up
the
little
brick
walk
with
her
long
boyish
strides
and
breaking
into
a
laugh
finished
i
beard
the
prescott
himself
tower
and
all
chapter
ii
inside
the
cottage
it
was
what
nancy
called
the
pluperfect
hour
of
the
day
that
is
of
a
rainy
day
the
curtains
of
the
were
drawn
over
the
windows
the
mellow
lamplight
dealing
kindly
with
their
faded
folds
the
rain
which
had
brought
with
it
an
early
autumn
chill
beat
rhythmically
against
the
panes
and
gurgled
contentedly
from
a
water
spout
as
if
it
were
revelling
in
the
fact
that
it
had
had
the
whole
countryside
to
itself
for
hours
alma
had
washed
her
yellow
hair
and
had
built
a
fire
to
dry
it
by
nancy
in
her
and
slippers
with
her
own
brown
mane
braided
into
a
short
thick
club
was
icing
the
chocolate
cake
helping
herself
generously
to
the
scrapings
in
the
earthenware
bowl
prescott
was
embroidering
this
was
her
greatest
accomplishment
learned
in
a
french
convent
knitting
bored
her
to
death
and
darning
drove
her
crazy
but
she
could
sit
by
the
hour
stitching
infinitesimal
petals
on
microscopic
flowers
and
turning
out
cake
mats
and
fancy
collars
by
the
score
faded
only
slightly
by
her
years
she
was
still
an
exquisitely
pretty
woman
with
a
face
marred
ever
so
little
by
the
fine
lines
which
drooped
from
the
corners
of
her
delicate
nose
to
the
corners
of
her
childish
mouth
her
golden
hair
was
barely
silvered
her
skin
as
fresh
and
rosy
as
alma
and
her
round
little
wrists
and
fingers
alma
might
have
envied
the
lacy
she
wore
which
at
the
slightest
motion
shook
out
a
faint
little
whiff
of
some
expensive
french
perfume
struck
an
odd
note
in
the
shabby
room
where
the
couch
sadly
displayed
a
broken
spring
and
not
the
most
careful
placing
of
furniture
that
nancy
could
devise
entirely
concealed
the
holes
in
the
faded
carpet
we
ought
to
put
a
glass
cover
over
mother
the
way
some
people
cover
french
clocks
nancy
said
laughingly
you
much
too
valuable
to
get
any
of
the
dust
of
life
on
you
mamma
i
getting
old
my
dear
i
only
think
of
my
daughters
now
said
prescott
with
a
little
sigh
and
pushing
a
curly
wisp
of
hair
back
from
her
face
i
shall
be
putting
on
spectacles
soon
catch
you
you
go
blind
as
a
bat
before
you
do
any
such
violence
to
your
beauty
you
like
alma
i
had
to
argue
for
half
an
hour
to
make
alma
wear
her
raincoat
it
was
becoming
and
far
rather
die
of
pneumonia
than
look
like
a
a
hippopotamus
said
alma
that
what
i
look
like
in
the
old
thing
the
sleeves
dangle
over
my
hands
like
a
fire
hose
nancy
i
come
to
a
definite
conclusion
in
regard
to
you
and
alma
for
this
winter
said
prescott
laying
down
her
embroidery
and
trying
to
look
practical
and
decided
how
much
will
it
cost
nancy
eyes
twinkled
it
not
a
question
of
money
nothing
ever
is
with
mamma
and
alma
nancy
thought
but
she
was
silent
and
continued
to
lick
the
chocolate
off
her
spoon
composedly
i
have
thought
the
whole
thing
over
very
carefully
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
matter
of
money
must
not
be
weighed
against
the
value
which
it
would
have
for
you
girls
it
not
a
trip
to
europe
is
it
mamma
asked
alma
quite
as
if
she
expected
that
this
might
be
the
case
indeed
a
trip
to
europe
would
have
been
no
more
incredible
to
nancy
than
her
mother
plan
which
prescott
proceeded
to
unfold
you
see
my
dears
living
as
we
do
you
girls
are
absolutely
cut
off
from
the
opportunities
which
are
so
essential
to
every
girl
success
in
life
this
has
been
a
great
worry
to
me
you
are
growing
older
and
you
are
forming
no
acquaintances
that
will
be
of
value
to
you
for
this
reason
i
have
decided
that
the
expense
of
sending
you
both
for
a
last
year
you
understand
to
a
good
school
a
smart
school
a
school
where
alma
can
meet
girls
who
will
count
for
something
in
social
life
is
an
expense
that
must
be
met
but
heavens
we
had
all
the
ordinary
schooling
we
need
exclaimed
nancy
in
amazement
if
if
i
could
just
have
a
few
months
tutoring
so
that
i
could
take
my
college
exams
in
the
spring
i
could
work
my
way
through
college
easily
i
do
want
you
to
go
to
college
nancy
said
prescott
irritably
what
in
the
world
is
the
use
of
a
whole
lot
of
ologies
and
isms
and
ruining
your
looks
over
a
lot
of
senseless
analyzing
and
dissecting
and
everything
i
wo
be
studying
anything
useless
mother
dearest
but
do
you
see
that
it
will
be
ever
so
much
easier
for
me
to
get
a
position
as
a
teacher
if
i
can
show
a
bachelor
degree
instead
of
just
a
smattering
of
french
or
a
thimbleful
of
ancient
history
there
no
reason
why
you
should
think
of
becoming
a
teacher
answered
prescott
and
i
wish
you
would
talk
about
it
so
dreadfully
drab
and
gloomy
but
i
want
to
make
my
living
in
some
way
if
you
and
alma
marry
well
there
wo
be
any
reason
why
you
should
make
your
living
but
mother
we
ca
count
on
chance
like
that
suppose
alma
and
i
never
met
a
rich
man
whom
we
could
love
we
be
helpless
a
year
at
miss
leland
will
give
both
of
you
plenty
of
opportunities
you
meet
girls
there
whom
you
ought
to
know
girls
who
will
invite
you
to
their
houses
through
whom
you
meet
eligible
young
men
the
expense
of
paying
for
board
and
tuition
at
miss
leland
would
be
the
least
of
the
digging
we
have
to
do
into
the
family
purse
be
under
obligations
to
people
which
we
would
never
be
in
a
position
to
repay
we
be
no
better
than
plain
ordinary
sponges
i
i
could
bear
it
besides
the
fees
at
miss
leland
are
terribly
high
i
could
go
to
college
for
almost
two
years
on
what
i
pay
for
one
year
at
miss
leland
and
all
that
we
get
at
that
school
would
be
a
little
french
a
smattering
of
history
dancing
and
fudge
parties
and
extremely
desirable
acquaintances
but
mother
we
never
be
able
to
keep
up
with
them
on
their
own
scale
of
living
pleaded
nancy
with
a
hopeless
conviction
in
her
heart
that
she
was
talking
to
the
winds
girls
like
elise
porterbridge
and
jane
whiteright
have
an
allowance
of
a
hundred
a
month
and
anything
else
they
want
when
they
spent
it
you
got
money
on
the
brain
nancy
said
alma
shaking
her
curls
off
her
face
you
are
a
regular
old
miser
well
you
right
perhaps
i
i
hate
to
heaven
knows
but
we
do
have
to
think
about
it
alma
it
the
poor
gamblers
who
are
always
counting
on
a
lucky
chance
that
are
ruined
i
want
to
be
prepared
for
the
worst
and
then
if
something
nice
turns
up
why
would
that
be
ten
times
better
than
if
when
we
had
been
counting
on
the
best
the
worst
should
happen
you
see
dears
prescott
had
entirely
missed
the
point
of
nancy
last
remark
uncle
thomas
is
very
old
and
i
am
sure
i
am
sure
that
he
will
relent
oh
mother
poor
nancy
flung
up
both
hands
in
despair
i
have
entered
you
both
at
miss
leland
so
really
there
is
no
use
in
arguing
about
it
any
more
and
i
already
sent
the
check
for
the
first
term
everything
is
decided
i
did
tell
you
until
just
because
i
was
afraid
that
this
old
nancy
of
mine
would
try
to
argue
me
out
of
it
when
i
that
it
the
best
and
wisest
thing
to
do
nancy
darling
please
do
scowl
like
that
you
angry
with
mother
are
you
a
soft
little
hand
was
laid
on
muscular
brown
one
and
in
spite
of
herself
the
girl
relented
with
a
whimsical
smile
and
a
sigh
i
like
to
see
anyone
who
could
be
angry
with
you
for
two
minutes
she
said
burrowing
her
brown
head
in
the
lace
on
her
mother
shoulder
that
nasty
old
uncle
thomas
has
been
angry
with
me
for
ten
years
very
nearly
is
he
a
dreadful
old
man
laughed
prescott
tweaking
nancy
ear
we
have
to
get
a
lot
of
new
clothes
if
we
are
going
to
boarding
school
alma
having
spread
the
towel
on
the
floor
reclined
full
length
in
front
of
the
fire
and
meditated
with
satisfaction
on
the
delightful
prospect
mamma
if
i
could
just
once
have
a
hat
with
a
feather
on
it
a
genuine
i
be
happy
for
the
rest
of
my
days
would
alma
be
lovely
cried
prescott
delightedly
oh
you
do
know
how
i
long
to
give
my
daughters
everything
everything
one
thing
you
must
have
alma
is
a
black
velvet
dress
made
very
simply
of
course
they
are
so
serviceable
she
flung
this
sop
to
nancy
who
with
her
head
thrown
back
was
tracing
phantom
figures
in
the
air
with
her
forefinger
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
she
observed
agreeably
oh
darling
uncle
thomas
kindly
lend
us
a
million
we
need
it
oh
we
need
it
every
hour
we
need
it
let
set
one
day
aside
for
shopping
was
alma
bright
suggestion
she
felt
that
this
would
be
her
element
we
go
into
the
city
in
the
morning
get
everything
done
by
noon
lunch
at
mailliard
and
then
go
to
a
matinée
i
have
seen
a
play
since
papa
took
us
to
see
humpty
dumpty
when
nance
and
i
were
little
things
i
got
cents
said
nancy
i
like
to
see
the
color
of
money
before
we
do
any
gallivanting
well
i
not
going
to
sit
here
gazing
at
that
cake
another
minute
give
me
a
slice
nancy
lambkin
just
a
wee
little
scrooch
of
it
begged
alma
snuffing
the
handsome
chocolate
masterpiece
of
nancy
culinary
skill
nancy
took
off
a
crumb
and
gave
it
to
her
which
elicited
a
wail
of
indignation
from
alma
well
here
you
are
and
it
give
you
a
nice
too
predicted
nancy
cutting
off
a
generous
slice
good
heavens
the
mother
she
stopped
knife
in
hand
and
listened
petrified
who
on
earth
can
be
coming
here
at
this
time
of
night
and
all
of
us
in
our
alma
you
the
most
nearly
dressed
of
all
of
us
here
pin
up
your
hair
there
it
goes
again
fly
alma
seized
a
handful
of
hairpins
and
thrusting
them
into
her
hair
as
she
went
ran
out
of
the
room
nancy
and
her
mother
listened
with
eyebrows
raised
must
be
a
letter
or
something
nancy
surmised
you
suppose
it
could
be
alma
forestalled
her
conjectures
whatever
they
might
have
been
by
entering
the
room
with
her
face
shining
and
an
opened
letter
in
her
hand
it
an
nancy
she
beamed
is
that
exciting
elise
porterbridge
wants
us
to
come
to
a
dance
she
giving
next
friday
night
and
the
chauffeur
is
waiting
for
an
answer
funny
she
was
in
such
a
hurry
remarked
nancy
i
suppose
someone
fell
out
and
she
trying
to
get
her
list
made
up
what
do
you
think
mother
why
it
delightful
i
want
you
to
know
elise
better
anyway
you
know
her
aunt
married
the
prince
brognelotti
and
she
will
probably
do
everything
for
that
girl
when
she
makes
her
début
prescott
rustled
over
to
the
and
despatched
a
note
in
her
flowing
pointed
hand
hush
mamma
the
chauffeur
will
hear
you
cautioned
nancy
with
a
slight
frown
it
always
pricked
her
when
alma
or
her
mother
said
snobbish
little
things
and
roused
her
democratic
pride
the
stiffest
pride
in
the
world
a
dance
carolled
alma
when
the
door
had
slammed
again
behind
the
emissary
of
the
porterbridge
heiress
a
real
sure
enough
dance
she
seized
nancy
by
the
waist
and
whirled
her
about
then
suddenly
she
stopped
so
abruptly
that
nancy
bumped
hard
against
the
table
face
was
sober
as
the
great
feminine
wail
rose
to
her
lips
i
have
a
thing
to
wear
you
must
get
something
then
said
prescott
positively
as
if
it
were
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
i
want
you
to
look
lovely
alma
it
dreadful
to
think
of
a
girl
with
your
beauty
not
being
able
to
appear
at
your
best
all
the
time
prescott
had
a
habit
of
speaking
to
alma
as
if
she
were
a
petted
débutante
of
nineteen
instead
of
just
a
pretty
youngster
of
sixteen
she
looked
at
nancy
who
was
the
treasurer
of
the
family
much
as
an
impecunious
queen
might
look
at
her
first
lord
of
the
exchequer
while
asking
him
for
funds
to
buy
a
new
crown
why
ca
you
wear
your
blue
crepe
was
nancy
unfeeling
answer
it
very
becoming
and
you
hardly
worn
it
if
you
call
that
an
evening
dress
alma
cried
on
the
verge
of
tears
you
a
vivid
imagination
that
all
i
got
to
say
i
just
go
if
i
have
to
look
dowdy
and
i
would
have
any
kind
of
a
time
you
know
that
you
could
cut
out
the
neck
and
sleeves
and
get
a
new
girdle
going
to
do
that
to
my
yellow
and
with
a
few
flowers
there
be
some
lovely
cosmos
in
the
garden
it
look
very
nice
and
you
sure
to
have
a
good
time
no
matter
what
you
wear
alma
oh
she
ca
go
if
her
clothes
are
just
right
nancy
that
all
there
is
to
it
said
prescott
clothes
declared
alma
her
voice
quavering
between
tears
and
indignation
are
the
most
important
things
in
the
world
it
matter
pretty
a
girl
is
if
her
dress
is
dowdy
no
one
will
notice
her
and
you
must
remember
nancy
that
she
will
be
compared
with
girls
who
will
be
sure
to
be
wearing
the
freshest
smartest
and
daintiest
things
added
prescott
nancy
began
to
laugh
they
argued
with
her
as
if
she
were
some
stingy
old
master
of
the
house
instead
of
a
slip
of
a
girl
of
seventeen
but
there
was
some
truth
in
what
alma
had
said
and
nancy
knew
what
agonies
would
torment
her
if
she
felt
that
she
fell
a
whit
below
any
girl
at
the
dance
in
point
of
dress
nancy
could
sympathize
with
her
there
only
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
that
she
and
alma
should
have
new
dresses
she
thought
hard
a
moment
there
was
not
very
much
left
in
the
family
budget
to
carry
them
through
the
remainder
of
the
month
but
then
she
might
let
the
grocer
and
butcher
bills
run
over
or
better
still
she
might
charge
at
one
of
the
city
department
stores
where
the
prescotts
still
kept
an
account
it
would
be
too
bad
if
alma
first
dance
should
be
spoiled
even
if
the
couch
did
go
in
its
shabby
plush
for
another
month
or
so
five
yards
of
silk
would
come
to
about
fifteen
dollars
new
slippers
not
less
than
seven
silk
stockings
two
that
made
dollars
thirty
to
give
a
margin
for
odds
and
ends
like
lining
and
trimming
alma
would
need
a
pretty
evening
dress
when
she
went
off
to
school
and
she
might
as
well
have
it
now
well
listen
you
poor
old
darling
she
said
slowly
saturday
if
we
trot
in
town
on
monday
and
get
the
material
we
could
easily
make
up
a
pretty
dress
for
you
to
wear
on
friday
night
see
she
could
have
a
pale
blue
taffeta
prescott
suggested
who
was
in
her
element
when
the
subject
turned
to
the
matter
of
clothes
made
perfectly
plain
with
a
broad
girdle
or
you
could
have
a
girdle
and
of
silver
ribbon
and
wear
silver
slippers
with
it
it
would
be
dear
with
a
round
neck
and
tiny
little
sleeves
and
a
short
bouffant
skirt
you
could
wear
my
old
evening
wrap
still
in
perfect
condition
that
would
be
shrieked
alma
flinging
her
arms
about
them
both
you
two
are
angelic
that
what
you
are
monday
morning
then
said
nancy
we
better
take
an
early
train
when
her
mother
and
sister
had
gone
to
bed
she
took
out
her
little
account
book
and
began
to
figure
then
all
at
once
she
flung
the
pencil
down
in
disgust
at
herself
alma
right
i
turning
into
a
regular
old
miser
i
not
going
to
bother
i
not
going
to
bother
but
but
somebody
to
she
frowned
staring
at
the
small
picture
of
her
father
which
smiled
gaily
at
her
from
the
top
of
the
desk
you
left
that
little
job
to
me
did
you
she
said
aloud
and
the
memory
of
some
words
her
father
had
once
spoken
to
her
laughingly
came
back
to
her
mind
you
my
eldest
son
nancy
mind
you
take
care
of
the
women
only
i
jolly
well
sick
of
being
a
boy
daddy
she
said
as
she
jumped
into
bed
i
let
the
first
person
who
steps
forward
take
the
job
chapter
iii
a
modern
cinderella
let
take
a
cab
to
the
station
the
roads
are
awfully
wet
still
and
i
ruin
my
shoes
suggested
alma
the
little
family
were
at
breakfast
nancy
and
alma
hastily
swallowing
their
coffee
so
that
they
could
hurry
off
to
the
station
after
the
fit
of
autumn
wind
and
rain
another
summer
day
had
come
with
a
glistening
sunlight
which
was
doing
its
best
to
cheer
up
the
drooping
flowers
in
the
tiny
garden
we
do
need
a
cab
what
are
you
talking
about
replied
nancy
glancing
out
of
the
window
it
a
wonderful
day
and
we
do
have
to
make
for
all
the
puddles
on
the
way
to
the
station
like
ducks
by
the
way
do
let
me
forget
to
stop
at
the
bank
i
dare
say
i
ought
to
take
some
money
with
me
in
case
we
ca
get
just
what
we
want
at
frelinghuysen
how
much
do
you
think
we
should
have
mother
dollars
ought
to
be
enough
said
prescott
vaguely
after
a
moment
calculation
nancy
whooped
good
gracious
why
if
i
spend
a
cent
over
forty
have
to
live
on
bread
and
water
for
the
rest
of
the
month
well
just
as
you
think
dear
you
know
best
of
course
prescott
answered
absently
you
two
had
better
be
starting
i
wish
you
would
get
alma
a
new
hat
while
you
in
town
nancy
i
quite
like
that
one
she
has
it
does
go
with
her
suit
nancy
pushed
her
chair
back
from
the
table
i
trot
out
and
see
hannah
a
moment
we
have
about
minutes
alma
it
took
them
twenty
minutes
to
walk
to
the
station
alma
was
in
high
spirits
nancy
still
thoughtful
but
the
wind
was
up
and
out
tossing
the
trees
rippling
the
puddles
which
reflected
a
clear
sparkling
sky
and
the
riotous
mood
of
the
morning
was
infectious
as
the
train
sped
through
the
open
country
passing
stretches
of
yellowing
fields
clusters
of
woodland
and
busy
little
villages
alma
chattered
joyously
are
you
awfully
glad
about
the
party
nancy
do
you
think
we
can
go
to
a
matinée
it
such
a
deliciously
idle
luxurious
sort
of
thing
to
do
i
going
to
have
chicken
patties
for
luncheon
and
lots
of
that
scrumptious
chocolate
icecream
that
almost
black
do
you
love
restaurant
food
nancy
it
such
fun
to
sit
and
watch
the
people
and
wonder
what
they
are
going
to
do
after
luncheon
and
what
they
are
saying
to
each
other
and
where
they
live
when
i
married
i
shall
certainly
live
in
town
and
i
have
a
box
at
the
opera
and
i
carry
a
pair
of
those
on
jewelled
sticks
and
every
morning
i
go
in
my
car
and
shop
and
then
i
meet
my
husband
for
luncheon
at
or
the
plaza
of
course
you
have
a
on
long
island
suggested
nancy
with
irony
which
alma
took
quite
seriously
oh
yes
with
terraces
and
italian
gardens
i
love
to
be
seen
standing
in
a
beautiful
garden
with
broad
marble
steps
and
rows
of
poplar
trees
and
a
for
whose
benefit
oh
my
own
we
feeling
rich
are
we
well
i
do
know
anything
that
feels
better
than
to
be
going
to
buy
a
new
dress
shall
we
get
the
hat
too
nancy
what
do
you
think
alma
hesitated
well
i
suppose
we
better
wait
it
funny
how
when
you
start
spending
money
at
all
you
want
to
get
everything
under
the
sun
of
course
girls
like
elise
or
jane
get
everything
they
want
exactly
and
when
you
with
them
you
feel
that
you
must
let
go
too
and
if
you
ca
afford
it
nancy
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
alma
finished
for
her
it
makes
you
miserable
or
else
said
nancy
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
or
else
if
you
bothered
with
any
too
much
pride
you
do
what
that
margot
cunningham
does
she
simply
camps
on
the
porterbridges
elise
is
so
that
she
lets
margot
buy
everything
she
likes
and
charge
it
to
her
and
margot
finds
life
so
comfy
there
that
she
ca
tear
herself
away
rather
work
my
fingers
to
the
bone
than
take
so
much
as
a
pair
of
gloves
given
to
me
out
of
charity
nancy
eyes
sparkled
alma
was
silent
there
were
times
when
nancy
fierce
stubborn
pride
frightened
her
sometimes
the
way
her
sister
lips
folded
together
and
her
small
cleft
chin
was
lifted
made
her
fancy
that
there
might
be
a
resemblance
between
nancy
and
old
prescott
alma
was
the
butterfly
and
nancy
the
bee
the
butterfly
no
doubt
wonders
why
the
bee
so
busily
stores
away
the
honey
won
by
thrift
and
industry
and
in
all
probability
the
bee
reads
many
a
lesson
to
the
idler
who
clings
to
the
sunny
flower
but
the
bee
relented
now
consider
yourself
the
owner
of
unlimited
wealth
said
nancy
as
they
swung
briskly
into
the
concourse
of
the
grand
central
station
you
a
regular
cinderella
and
your
godmother
who
is
going
to
perform
the
stupendously
brilliant
mystifying
act
of
turning
twenty
rolls
of
and
three
coats
of
brown
paint
into
five
yards
of
superb
silk
two
silver
slippers
two
silk
stockings
and
three
yards
of
silver
ribbon
or
one
simple
country
maiden
into
a
fashionable
miss
of
entrancing
beauty
nancy
you
the
most
angelic
person
squealed
alma
but
you
going
to
get
yourself
something
too
it
makes
me
feel
awfully
mean
to
get
new
things
when
you
have
to
wear
that
dowdy
old
yellow
thing
dowdy
indeed
it
grand
nancy
prescott
was
charming
in
a
simple
gown
of
which
hung
in
the
straight
lines
now
so
much
in
vogue
her
only
ornaments
were
a
bouquet
of
rare
flowers
contrasting
exquisitely
with
the
shade
of
her
frock
a
toilette
of
unusual
chic
miss
alma
prescott
melbrook
noted
beauty
was
superb
in
a
lavish
creation
you
going
to
be
awfully
lavish
and
quite
the
belle
of
the
ball
you
ought
to
have
some
new
slippers
nancy
a
pair
of
gold
ones
would
absolutely
your
dress
my
black
ones
are
all
right
i
put
fresh
bows
on
them
said
nancy
firm
as
a
trojan
outwardly
though
within
her
resolution
wavered
dared
she
take
another
seven
dollars
she
began
to
feel
reckless
are
you
waited
on
madam
the
smooth
voice
of
a
saleswoman
roused
her
from
her
calculations
we
want
to
see
some
blue
taffeta
not
awfully
expensive
step
this
way
we
have
something
exquisite
five
dollars
a
yard
oh
have
you
anything
less
than
that
stammered
nancy
in
dismay
alma
glanced
at
her
reprovingly
for
heaven
sake
do
sound
as
if
you
had
a
dollar
to
your
name
or
she
just
and
walk
off
she
whispered
at
the
expensive
silk
and
then
work
around
to
the
cheaper
explain
that
it
more
what
we
want
and
so
on
yes
and
the
cheaper
silk
will
look
so
impossible
after
we
seen
the
other
that
we
be
taking
it
returned
nancy
know
their
wiles
here
is
a
beautiful
material
quite
new
lured
the
saleswoman
a
wonderful
shade
it
will
be
impossible
to
duplicate
see
how
it
falls
as
softly
and
gracefully
as
satin
but
with
more
body
to
it
the
other
is
much
stiffer
how
how
much
is
it
asked
nancy
feebly
it
special
of
course
later
on
the
regular
price
will
be
is
it
breathed
alma
touching
the
gleaming
stuff
with
careful
fingers
have
have
you
anything
for
about
three
dollars
a
yard
asked
nancy
wishing
that
alma
would
do
the
haggling
sometimes
the
saleswoman
listlessly
unrolled
a
yard
or
two
from
another
bolt
and
held
it
up
is
it
for
yourself
madam
or
for
the
other
young
lady
it
for
my
sister
let
me
hold
this
against
your
hair
alma
it
not
nearly
so
nice
as
the
other
of
course
observed
alma
in
a
casual
tone
it
awfully
stiff
and
the
color
sort
of
washed
out
i
really
think
oh
of
course
this
paler
shade
is
not
nearly
so
effective
at
night
agreed
the
saleswoman
pouncing
keenly
upon
her
prey
see
how
beautifully
this
deeper
color
brings
out
the
gold
in
the
young
hair
would
you
like
to
take
it
to
the
mirror
miss
oh
do
alma
begged
nancy
in
comical
despair
of
course
there
is
any
comparison
she
felt
herself
weakening
i
i
suppose
this
would
really
wear
better
too
of
course
it
would
said
alma
quickly
that
other
stuff
is
so
stiff
it
would
split
in
no
time
five
times
thirty
dollars
nancy
wrinkled
her
forehead
but
she
knew
that
she
had
succumbed
even
before
she
announced
her
surrender
the
saleswoman
watching
her
smiled
alma
preened
herself
in
front
of
the
long
mirror
frankly
admiring
herself
with
the
soft
silken
stuff
draped
around
her
shoulders
all
right
said
nancy
give
me
five
yards
charged
purred
the
saleswoman
but
nancy
had
no
mind
to
have
the
gray
ghost
of
her
extravagance
revisit
her
on
the
first
of
the
month
no
no
i
pay
for
it
and
take
it
with
me
she
counted
out
her
little
roll
of
bills
trying
not
to
notice
the
pitiable
way
in
which
her
purse
shrank
in
like
the
cheeks
of
a
hungry
man
is
there
nothing
you
would
like
for
yourself
madam
murmured
the
voice
of
the
temptress
here
is
some
ravishing
charmeuse
the
true
with
your
dark
hair
and
eyes
oh
no
no
thanks
nancy
clutched
alma
and
turned
her
head
away
from
the
shimmering
fabric
for
all
her
stiff
she
was
only
human
and
a
girl
with
a
healthy
ardent
longing
for
beautiful
finery
prudent
she
was
but
prudence
soon
reaches
its
limits
when
the
pressure
of
feminine
vanity
and
exquisite
luxury
is
brought
to
bear
upon
it
there
was
only
one
course
of
resistance
nancy
fled
now
slippers
alma
skipped
along
beside
her
hugging
her
precious
bundles
with
shining
eyes
and
cheeks
aglow
i
think
i
love
slippers
better
than
anything
in
the
world
nancy
you
a
perfect
they
tried
on
slippers
certainly
alma
tiny
foot
and
slender
ankle
was
a
delightful
object
to
contemplate
as
she
turned
it
this
way
and
that
before
the
little
mirror
if
you
had
a
little
buckle
miss
we
have
some
very
new
rhinestone
ornaments
i
like
to
show
you
one
a
butterfly
set
in
a
fan
of
silver
lace
just
a
moment
before
nancy
could
stop
her
the
saleswoman
had
gone
we
wo
get
the
buckles
you
dear
old
thing
alma
said
consolingly
bending
the
sole
of
her
foot
we
just
look
at
them
nancy
smiled
wryly
i
to
get
you
everything
in
the
shop
i
hate
to
be
stingy
with
you
dear
it
just
this
old
thing
and
she
held
up
the
shabby
purse
that
perfectly
gorgeous
shrieked
alma
as
the
saleswoman
held
a
little
jewelled
poised
on
a
spray
of
silver
lace
against
her
instep
gorgeous
echoed
nancy
it
a
very
chic
trimming
of
course
we
use
it
only
on
the
handsomer
slippers
chanted
the
saleswoman
now
we
could
put
that
on
for
you
in
five
minutes
and
really
the
expense
would
be
small
considering
that
nothing
more
would
be
needed
as
an
ornament
and
it
would
be
the
smartest
thing
to
wear
no
trimming
on
the
dress
whatever
how
much
would
it
be
asked
alma
i
i
ca
take
it
now
but
later
the
buckles
are
five
dollars
and
with
the
lace
fan
it
would
come
to
seven
i
would
advise
you
the
prices
will
go
up
in
another
month
well
alma
nancy
hesitated
made
one
last
frantic
grasp
at
her
fleeting
prudence
and
surrendered
fourteen
dollars
all
right
you
can
take
the
buckles
as
a
christmas
present
from
me
i
pay
for
those
and
we
be
back
for
them
after
we
got
some
other
things
nancy
you
angel
you
lamb
you
duck
you
angelic
dumpling
crowed
alma
i
never
felt
so
absolutely
luxurious
in
all
my
life
i
do
imagine
you
ever
did
remarked
nancy
she
was
aghast
at
her
own
extravagance
she
judged
herself
harshly
as
the
victim
of
the
failing
which
she
had
so
long
combatted
in
her
mother
and
sister
every
atom
of
the
prudence
with
which
she
had
armed
herself
seemed
to
be
melting
away
like
wax
before
a
furnace
she
had
already
spent
dollars
and
there
was
still
the
silver
ribbon
to
be
bought
which
would
bring
the
sum
up
to
at
the
very
least
she
had
originally
intended
to
buy
one
or
two
small
items
with
which
to
freshen
up
her
own
dress
for
the
dance
but
she
stubbornly
put
aside
the
idea
nancy
darling
are
you
going
to
get
yourself
some
slippers
no
i
do
need
them
the
ones
i
have
are
quite
good
i
feel
so
mean
nancy
do
you
think
i
horribly
selfish
selfish
you
are
the
least
bit
selfish
dear
i
can
understand
perfectly
how
you
hate
to
go
among
all
those
rich
girls
without
looking
as
as
any
of
them
when
you
a
thousand
times
prettier
than
the
nicest
looking
one
of
them
besides
just
this
once
she
paused
realizing
that
it
was
not
a
case
of
just
this
once
at
all
pretty
new
clothes
and
pocket
money
would
be
the
barest
necessities
when
they
should
be
at
miss
leland
why
did
her
mother
see
the
folly
of
sending
them
to
a
place
where
they
would
learn
to
want
things
actually
to
need
things
far
beyond
the
reach
of
their
little
bank
account
and
where
alma
chumming
with
girls
who
had
everything
that
feminine
fancy
could
desire
would
either
be
made
miserable
or
she
tried
to
rout
her
own
practical
thoughts
why
was
it
that
she
was
so
unwilling
to
trust
in
rosy
chance
why
was
it
always
she
who
had
to
bring
the
wet
blanket
of
harsh
common
sense
to
dampen
her
mother
and
sister
debonair
trust
in
a
smiling
providence
was
she
wrong
after
all
she
considered
the
lilies
of
the
field
but
somehow
she
could
not
believe
that
their
example
was
the
wisest
one
for
impecunious
human
beings
to
follow
lilies
could
live
on
sun
and
dew
and
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
wave
in
the
wind
oh
look
nancy
are
those
feather
fans
exquisite
alma
do
you
dare
to
peep
at
another
showcase
in
this
store
or
i
tie
my
handkerchief
over
your
eyes
and
lead
you
out
blindfolded
like
a
horse
out
of
a
fire
but
look
at
those
darling
little
bottles
of
perfume
straight
from
paris
i
can
tell
from
those
adorable
boxes
with
the
orange
silk
tassels
would
you
give
anything
on
earth
to
have
one
when
i
rich
i
going
to
have
dozens
of
bottles
those
slender
crystal
ones
with
enamel
tops
and
they
stand
in
a
row
across
the
top
of
a
louis
xvi
nancy
smiled
at
phrase
when
i
rich
she
wondered
if
her
butterfly
sister
had
formed
any
clear
notions
of
how
that
beatific
state
was
to
be
realized
alma
prescott
there
the
door
and
thank
heaven
for
it
have
the
goodness
to
go
directly
through
it
the
street
is
immediately
beyond
and
that
is
the
safest
place
for
us
two
little
wanderers
at
present
dollars
for
just
one
evening
fun
gold
slippers
would
have
been
just
the
thing
to
wear
with
her
yellow
dress
but
well
chapter
iv
ladies
of
fashion
the
little
bedroom
which
alma
and
nancy
shared
together
wore
a
gaily
appearance
on
that
memorable
night
quite
as
if
it
had
succumbed
to
the
mood
of
flighty
joy
which
was
in
the
air
the
dresser
usually
a
very
model
of
good
order
except
when
alma
had
been
rummaging
about
it
unchecked
was
strewn
with
hairpins
manicuring
implements
snips
of
ribbon
and
the
stems
of
fresh
flowers
all
the
drawers
were
partly
open
projecting
at
unequal
distances
and
giving
glimpses
of
the
girls
simple
underwear
which
had
been
ruthlessly
overturned
in
frantic
scramblings
for
such
finery
as
they
possessed
a
fresh
slightly
scented
haze
of
powder
drifted
up
as
nancy
briskly
dusted
her
arms
and
shoulders
and
then
earnestly
performed
the
same
attentions
for
alma
prescott
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
alive
with
interest
in
the
primping
and
taking
as
keen
a
delight
in
her
daughters
as
she
had
done
in
her
own
preparations
for
conquest
twenty
years
before
as
critical
as
a
parisian
modiste
she
cocked
her
pretty
head
on
one
side
and
surveyed
the
girls
with
an
expression
of
alertness
mingled
with
satisfaction
such
as
you
might
see
on
the
face
of
a
clever
business
man
who
watches
the
promising
development
of
a
smart
plan
with
elation
though
not
without
an
eye
ready
to
detect
the
slightest
hitch
unquestionably
she
was
justified
in
pinning
the
highest
hopes
on
eventual
success
in
life
if
sheer
exquisite
prettiness
can
be
a
safe
guarantee
for
such
alma
who
had
plainly
fallen
in
love
with
herself
minced
this
way
and
that
before
the
glass
blissfully
conscious
of
her
mother
and
sister
unveiled
delight
in
her
beauty
her
yellow
hair
bright
as
gold
itself
spun
into
an
aura
of
hazy
filaments
was
piled
up
on
top
of
her
head
so
that
curls
escaped
against
the
white
nape
of
her
neck
her
dress
was
truly
a
masterpiece
and
if
there
had
been
a
tinge
of
envy
in
nancy
nature
she
might
have
regretted
the
skill
with
which
she
herself
had
succeeded
in
setting
off
prettiness
until
her
own
good
looks
were
pale
almost
insignificant
beside
it
but
nancy
was
almost
singularly
devoid
of
envy
and
could
look
with
the
bright
impersonal
eyes
of
a
at
distracting
pink
and
white
cheeks
at
her
blue
eyes
which
looked
black
in
the
and
at
her
round
white
neck
and
arms
the
dress
left
arms
and
shoulders
bare
except
for
the
impudent
short
puffed
sleeves
which
dropped
low
on
the
shoulder
like
those
of
an
early
victorian
beauty
anything
but
victorian
however
was
the
brief
bouffant
skirt
which
showed
the
slim
ankles
and
the
little
arched
feet
in
their
handsome
slippers
you
perfectly
gorgeous
alma
you
a
legitimate
right
to
be
charmed
with
yourself
said
nancy
sitting
down
on
the
bed
beside
her
mother
to
enjoy
alma
frank
struttings
and
posings
i
am
nice
agreed
alma
naïvely
trying
to
suppress
a
smile
of
which
nevertheless
quirked
the
corners
of
her
lips
did
it
though
nancy
darling
i
do
forget
that
even
if
i
do
seem
to
be
a
conceited
little
thing
she
danced
over
and
kissed
nancy
cheek
lightly
her
frock
enchanting
her
with
its
crisp
rustlings
as
she
did
so
nancy
you
get
something
nice
too
the
next
time
you
should
have
made
up
a
new
dress
for
anyhow
nancy
said
prescott
turning
to
inspect
nancy
appearance
from
the
top
of
her
head
to
the
toes
of
her
freshly
ribboned
slippers
nancy
colored
slightly
it
had
not
been
a
very
easy
task
to
overcome
the
temptation
to
blow
herself
as
alma
would
have
debonairly
expressed
a
foolish
extravagance
and
it
was
not
particularly
soothing
to
have
that
feat
of
economy
found
fault
with
if
if
you
think
i
look
too
dowdy
i
i
stay
at
home
mother
she
said
in
a
quiet
tone
that
betrayed
a
touch
of
hurt
pride
you
know
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
me
to
get
another
dress
and
if
you
feel
sensitive
about
my
going
to
people
like
the
porterbridges
in
what
got
why
it
absurd
to
attempt
it
at
all
prescott
was
abashed
then
in
her
quick
sweet
impulsive
way
so
like
that
of
a
thoughtless
lovable
little
girl
she
put
her
arms
around
nancy
straight
young
shoulders
do
be
cross
with
me
darling
i
only
said
that
because
it
hurts
me
to
think
that
you
have
to
deny
yourself
anything
in
the
world
you
are
so
sweet
and
so
strong
and
and
i
love
you
so
my
dear
that
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
your
having
to
deny
yourself
the
pretty
things
that
are
given
to
the
daughters
of
so
many
other
women
instantly
nancy
unbent
and
turning
her
head
so
that
she
could
kiss
her
mother
soft
hair
she
whispered
with
a
tender
little
laugh
before
you
begin
pitying
us
dearest
you
can
can
just
remember
that
other
women
daughters
have
been
given
a
mother
like
you
and
then
because
just
like
a
boy
she
felt
embarrassed
at
her
own
emotion
and
the
tears
that
had
gathered
in
her
eyes
she
said
briskly
if
anyone
should
ask
me
my
candid
opinion
i
say
that
i
rather
pleased
with
myself
only
some
inner
voice
tells
me
that
i
not
completely
hooked
here
mother
by
means
of
an
excruciating
contortion
she
managed
to
indicate
a
small
gap
in
the
back
of
her
dress
just
between
the
shoulder
blades
you
do
look
awfully
nice
nancy
commented
alma
she
paused
reflectively
a
moment
and
then
added
you
know
i
suppose
that
at
first
glance
most
people
would
say
i
was
was
the
prettier
you
know
because
i
sort
of
and
pink
and
white
like
a
french
bonbon
but
an
artist
would
think
that
you
were
really
beautiful
i
hit
people
in
the
eye
like
a
magazine
cover
but
you
grow
on
them
slowly
like
a
a
rembrandt
or
something
whew
we
certainly
been
throwing
each
other
bouquets
broadcast
laughed
nancy
who
was
tremendously
pleased
nevertheless
you
better
put
your
cloak
on
alma
and
stop
turning
my
head
around
backwards
with
your
unblushing
flattery
is
that
our
coach
now
the
sound
of
wheels
on
the
wet
gravel
and
the
shambling
of
horses
hoofs
had
indeed
announced
the
arrival
of
the
coach
darn
it
that
idiotic
peterson
has
sent
us
the
most
decrepit
old
nag
in
his
stable
remarked
alma
looking
out
of
the
window
as
she
slid
her
bare
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
her
wrap
i
think
he
calls
her
which
means
the
of
god
she
looks
like
an
picture
of
a
baby
dinosaur
i
hope
to
heaven
she
wo
fall
to
pieces
before
we
get
within
walking
distance
of
the
porterbridges
said
nancy
i
think
that
carriage
she
has
attached
to
her
must
be
the
original
chariot
pharaoh
used
when
he
drove
after
the
israelites
in
a
gay
mood
the
two
sisters
climbed
into
the
ancient
coupé
which
smelt
strongly
of
damp
hay
and
jounced
away
behind
the
erratic
dorothea
who
started
off
at
a
mad
gallop
and
then
settled
abruptly
into
her
characteristic
amble
a
light
gentle
steady
rain
pattered
against
the
windows
which
chattered
like
the
teeth
of
an
old
beggar
on
a
wintry
day
the
two
girls
deliciously
nervous
would
burst
into
irrepressible
giggles
each
time
when
as
they
passed
a
street
lamp
the
ridiculously
elongated
shadow
of
dorothea
and
the
chariot
scurried
noiselessly
ahead
of
them
and
was
swallowed
up
in
a
stretch
of
darkness
my
dear
i
scared
breathed
alma
pinching
nancy
arm
in
a
nervous
spasm
my
tummy
feels
just
as
if
i
were
going
down
in
an
awfully
quick
elevator
i
do
see
what
are
scared
about
replied
nancy
almost
wish
this
regal
conveyance
of
ours
break
down
it
feels
as
if
one
of
the
wheels
were
coming
off
i
guess
they
are
all
coming
off
but
it
been
like
that
since
the
dark
ages
already
and
i
dare
say
it
will
last
another
century
or
so
look
there
uncle
thomas
house
now
does
it
look
exactly
like
something
that
poe
would
write
about
that
one
light
burning
in
the
tower
window
with
all
the
rest
of
the
house
just
a
huge
black
shape
is
positively
gruesome
the
two
girls
peered
through
the
dirty
little
mica
oval
behind
them
at
the
strange
old
mansion
the
bizarre
turrets
of
which
were
silhouetted
against
the
sky
where
the
edges
of
the
dark
clouds
had
parted
and
the
horizon
shone
with
a
paler
sickly
light
it
is
eerie
looking
i
suppose
old
uncle
is
up
in
that
room
poring
away
over
his
books
and
the
last
thing
he
be
thinking
of
is
his
two
charming
nieces
bouncing
off
to
an
evening
of
giddy
pleasure
in
this
antique
or
whatever
it
is
oh
my
dear
alma
squealed
faintly
we
getting
there
oh
look
at
all
the
automobiles
we
ca
go
in
in
this
dreadful
looking
thing
all
right
you
can
get
out
and
walk
i
say
do
your
hands
feel
like
damp
putty
they
i
feel
as
if
i
were
getting
the
measles
oh
here
we
are
nancy
alma
tone
would
have
suggested
that
they
had
reached
the
steps
of
the
guillotine
dorothea
alone
was
unmoved
and
almost
unmoving
with
her
poor
old
head
dangling
between
her
knees
she
crawled
slowly
along
the
broad
driveway
of
a
very
new
and
very
imposing
house
beset
fore
and
aft
by
a
train
of
honking
and
rumbling
motors
nancy
burst
into
a
little
breathy
quaver
of
hysterical
laughter
we
must
try
to
be
more
like
dorothea
she
giggled
her
beautiful
composure
is
due
either
to
an
aristocratic
pedigree
or
to
her
knowledge
that
she
is
going
to
die
soon
and
all
this
is
the
vanity
of
a
world
which
passes
in
spite
of
their
inner
agony
of
shyness
however
the
two
girls
descended
from
the
absurd
old
carriage
at
the
broad
steps
and
reached
the
door
under
the
footmen
umbrellas
with
every
outward
appearance
of
i
so
glad
you
could
come
nancy
alma
how
lovely
you
look
you
want
to
go
upstairs
and
take
off
your
wraps
elise
porterbridge
a
tall
fat
girl
dressed
in
vivid
green
greeted
them
and
with
all
the
dexterity
of
a
matronly
hostess
passed
them
on
into
the
chattering
mob
of
youths
and
girls
which
crowded
the
wide
brightly
lighted
hail
alma
clutched
nancy
arm
frantically
as
they
squeezed
their
way
through
to
the
stairs
did
you
see
a
living
soul
that
you
knew
besides
elise
whispered
alma
as
they
slipped
off
their
wraps
into
the
hands
of
the
little
maid
oh
it
would
be
too
awful
to
be
a
after
i
gone
and
gotten
these
lovely
slippers
and
everything
do
be
a
goose
this
is
a
good
time
do
you
know
one
when
you
see
it
here
pinch
your
cheeks
a
little
and
stop
looking
as
if
you
were
going
to
have
a
chill
you
the
prettiest
girl
here
and
that
ought
to
give
you
some
courage
while
nancy
poked
her
dress
and
tucked
in
a
stray
wisp
of
hair
alma
stood
eyeing
the
modish
young
ladies
who
primped
and
chattered
before
the
long
mirrors
around
them
with
the
round
solemn
gaze
of
a
hostile
baby
how
could
they
be
so
cool
so
absolutely
come
on
you
look
all
right
said
nancy
aloud
and
alma
marvelled
at
the
skill
with
which
her
sister
imitated
that
very
coolness
and
indifference
if
she
had
known
it
nancy
was
inwardly
quaking
with
the
nervous
dread
that
attacks
every
young
girl
at
her
first
big
party
like
a
violent
stage
fright
they
made
their
way
slowly
down
the
broad
stairs
passing
still
more
pretty
chattering
debonair
girls
who
were
calling
laughing
friendly
greeting
to
the
young
men
below
from
one
of
the
other
rooms
a
small
orchestra
throbbed
beneath
the
hum
of
voices
the
scent
of
half
a
dozen
french
perfumes
mingled
and
rose
on
the
hot
air
and
the
brilliant
colors
of
girls
dresses
stirred
and
wove
in
and
out
like
the
changing
bits
of
glass
in
a
kaleidoscope
er
i
say
miss
prescott
i
got
to
you
first
so
i
a
right
to
the
first
dance
it
was
frank
barrows
the
hero
of
potato
adventure
who
claimed
alma
before
her
little
silver
foot
had
reached
the
last
step
a
lean
young
man
with
sleek
blond
hair
a
weak
chin
and
the
manner
of
a
youth
who
has
been
spoiled
by
girls
ever
since
he
put
on
long
trousers
and
learned
to
run
his
own
car
he
looked
at
alma
with
that
look
of
startled
admiration
which
to
a
young
girl
is
a
sweeter
flattery
than
any
that
words
can
frame
she
looked
up
at
nancy
with
a
glance
of
joyous
innocent
triumph
and
then
putting
her
plump
little
hand
on
her
partner
arm
and
instantly
meeting
his
gallantry
with
the
pretty
utterly
unconscious
coquetry
of
a
born
flirt
she
moved
off
nancy
still
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
watched
the
yellow
head
as
it
passed
among
the
heads
of
the
other
dancers
that
quick
happy
glance
of
alma
had
said
forgive
me
for
being
so
pretty
you
are
better
and
finer
and
more
beautiful
but
they
have
found
it
out
yet
she
stood
alone
terribly
shy
her
smooth
cheeks
flushing
scarlet
and
her
bright
eyes
searching
timidly
for
some
friendly
corner
where
she
could
run
and
hide
herself
away
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
without
alma
beside
her
to
be
petted
and
protected
she
looked
almost
pathetically
just
what
she
was
a
modest
young
girl
who
was
peculiarly
lovely
and
appealing
as
she
stood
waiting
with
a
beating
heart
to
catch
a
friendly
eye
in
all
that
terrible
gay
selfish
throng
of
chapter
v
a
reticent
gentleman
and
miss
bancroft
with
only
the
one
aim
of
getting
to
harbor
by
hook
or
crook
nancy
her
cheeks
burning
with
shyness
edged
her
way
along
the
wall
she
would
not
have
felt
half
so
much
alone
if
she
had
been
dropped
into
the
middle
of
the
sahara
desert
and
while
her
little
feet
tingled
with
the
rhythm
of
the
music
she
surrendered
herself
to
the
unhappy
conviction
that
she
was
doomed
to
be
a
she
did
not
know
these
people
she
felt
as
if
she
could
never
know
them
everything
in
their
manner
their
speech
and
their
dress
suggested
a
foreignness
to
her
own
nature
that
could
never
be
bridged
unless
she
herself
changed
and
became
another
being
it
was
something
that
she
could
not
define
this
difference
it
was
simply
something
that
grew
out
of
a
different
way
of
thinking
and
feeling
about
life
all
these
people
seemed
to
make
pleasure
their
business
the
most
important
purpose
of
their
existence
and
this
attitude
expressed
in
the
very
way
that
the
girls
carried
themselves
in
the
tones
of
their
voices
in
their
light
scraps
of
inconsequential
and
not
very
clever
talk
made
her
feel
strange
beyond
description
she
stood
near
a
group
of
palms
under
the
arch
of
the
staircase
watching
the
faces
all
about
her
longing
one
minute
to
be
at
home
curled
up
with
a
book
on
her
shabby
comfortable
and
the
next
that
she
might
be
drawn
into
the
centre
of
all
that
bubbling
companionable
enjoyment
now
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
alma
who
was
standing
near
the
door
of
the
bantering
and
coquetting
with
a
little
cluster
of
youths
who
had
gathered
about
her
heaven
knows
where
from
or
how
like
flies
about
a
jar
of
new
honey
it
was
plainly
alma
natural
environment
in
which
she
revelled
like
a
joyous
young
fish
in
a
sunny
pool
so
that
pretty
little
creature
is
george
prescott
daughter
the
question
spoken
in
a
rather
deep
and
penetrating
voice
carried
clearly
to
nancy
ears
and
she
turned
at
a
little
distance
from
her
seated
on
a
small
couch
sat
porterbridge
a
lean
woman
with
a
aquiline
face
and
painfully
thin
neck
and
arms
and
the
old
lady
who
had
put
the
question
a
quite
old
lady
nancy
thought
enormously
fat
dressed
in
purple
velvet
her
huge
dimpled
arms
and
shoulders
billowing
out
of
it
like
the
whipped
cream
on
top
of
some
titanic
confection
two
small
plump
tapering
hands
clasped
a
handsome
feather
fan
against
her
almost
perpendicular
lap
two
generous
chins
completely
obliterated
any
outward
evidences
of
neck
so
that
her
head
seemed
to
have
been
set
upon
her
shoulders
with
the
naïve
simplicity
of
a
yet
for
all
this
one
glance
at
her
keen
intelligent
face
with
its
sleepy
twinkling
eyes
and
humorous
witty
mouth
was
enough
to
assure
one
that
whoever
she
might
be
she
was
not
an
ordinary
old
lady
by
any
means
one
guessed
at
once
that
she
had
seen
much
of
the
world
in
her
or
seventy
years
that
she
had
enjoyed
every
moment
of
the
entertainment
and
that
while
she
probably
required
everyone
else
to
respect
public
opinion
she
felt
comfortably
privileged
to
disregard
it
herself
whenever
she
pleased
she
had
been
busily
discussing
everyone
who
attracted
her
attention
disdaining
to
lower
her
sonorous
voice
or
to
conceal
in
any
way
the
fact
that
she
was
gossiping
briskly
young
and
old
alike
hastened
up
to
her
to
pay
their
respects
and
it
was
evident
from
their
manner
of
eager
deference
that
she
was
a
rather
important
old
person
whose
keen
and
fearless
tongue
made
her
good
opinion
worth
gaining
at
present
she
had
centred
her
lively
interest
upon
alma
and
nancy
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
listening
to
her
remarks
especially
since
the
old
lady
was
obviously
perfectly
willing
to
let
anyone
and
everyone
hear
her
who
might
have
reason
to
listen
that
is
little
alma
prescott
porterbridge
was
replying
she
is
charmingly
pretty
is
she
the
image
of
her
mother
tell
me
something
about
them
ridiculous
is
it
how
we
can
live
for
years
within
a
stone
throw
of
our
neighbors
without
ever
knowing
whether
their
sunday
clothes
are
made
of
silk
or
calico
george
prescott
used
to
be
my
particular
favorite
when
he
was
a
youngster
i
remember
when
he
married
that
little
beauty
i
gave
him
tons
of
my
choicest
advice
was
absolutely
prodigal
of
my
finest
gems
of
wisdom
but
when
i
saw
her
well
i
knew
very
well
that
there
would
be
ups
and
downs
she
should
have
married
an
indian
nabob
but
thought
i
i
might
as
well
shout
to
the
north
wind
to
be
placid
as
to
tell
him
to
give
her
up
and
find
himself
some
sensible
excellent
creature
who
could
mend
his
socks
and
turn
his
old
suits
for
him
he
would
rather
have
lived
on
burnt
potatoes
and
bacon
with
that
charming
little
spendthrift
than
have
enjoyed
all
the
blessings
of
good
housekeeping
at
the
hands
of
the
most
estimable
creature
we
could
have
found
for
him
i
do
like
that
spirit
in
a
young
man
however
much
my
excellent
common
sense
may
disapprove
of
it
i
saw
nothing
of
george
after
his
marriage
i
was
too
fond
of
him
to
stand
around
offering
advice
when
he
could
possibly
make
any
use
of
it
i
should
probably
have
lost
my
temper
just
as
tom
prescott
did
and
i
can
not
endure
to
be
in
such
a
ridiculous
position
i
had
a
notion
that
lallie
prescott
did
live
here
any
more
i
believe
that
the
family
suffers
rather
keen
financial
difficulties
said
porterbridge
the
girls
go
out
very
little
are
quite
isolated
in
fact
you
mean
that
they
are
hard
up
do
use
those
genteel
euphemisms
my
dear
i
ca
understand
i
sorry
it
was
inevitable
of
course
but
i
one
of
the
few
beings
that
sincerely
regret
seeing
other
people
reaping
what
sown
i
always
avoided
my
own
deserts
so
successfully
her
big
jolly
laugh
rang
out
at
this
there
are
two
girls
i
remember
both
pretty
yes
indeed
replied
porterbridge
in
the
unenthusiastic
tone
with
which
the
mother
of
a
rather
plain
daughter
will
praise
the
beauty
of
another
woman
daughter
hum
well
that
distinctly
i
really
could
work
up
any
heartfelt
interest
in
them
if
they
were
ugly
though
of
course
i
understand
that
beauty
is
only
skin
deep
and
handsome
is
as
handsome
does
and
all
that
whoever
invented
those
saws
must
have
been
unbearably
ugly
i
always
suspected
that
it
was
some
plain
jealous
old
wife
of
king
solomon
who
got
very
philosophical
in
her
old
age
now
i
really
like
to
know
what
little
lallie
prescott
is
going
to
do
with
them
porterbridge
gave
a
dry
affected
little
laugh
looking
at
alma
who
was
waltzing
again
with
the
obviously
infatuated
frank
barrows
well
i
imagine
that
she
is
going
to
do
all
that
she
can
to
marry
them
off
as
advantageously
as
possible
and
i
dare
say
that
both
of
them
now
do
say
anything
cattish
my
dear
interrupted
the
old
lady
quite
sharply
a
sudden
coldness
routing
the
twinkle
in
her
merry
eyes
i
always
know
when
you
are
going
to
say
something
that
will
annoy
me
and
nothing
annoys
me
more
than
to
hear
an
older
woman
say
anything
unkind
about
a
young
girl
i
tell
you
this
because
i
sure
that
you
do
want
to
make
me
angry
if
you
are
trying
to
tell
me
that
lallie
prescott
is
a
schemer
in
regard
to
the
future
of
her
two
daughters
why
i
should
be
very
much
surprised
to
learn
anything
else
we
are
all
schemers
for
our
children
and
just
as
in
love
and
war
we
consider
everything
fair
so
long
as
it
works
for
their
advantage
but
nancy
her
cheeks
burning
heard
no
more
in
a
last
desperate
effort
at
escape
she
turned
and
fled
unseen
through
the
nearest
doorway
at
first
she
did
not
realize
where
she
was
then
she
discovered
that
she
had
chanced
upon
a
veritable
haven
of
refuge
a
large
quiet
room
cosily
lighted
by
a
furnished
with
huge
armchairs
and
divans
and
lined
on
three
of
its
walls
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
whole
regiments
of
books
the
fourth
wall
was
monopolized
by
a
great
stone
fireplace
where
three
or
four
smouldered
softly
popping
every
now
and
then
into
small
explosions
of
ruddy
sparks
the
smell
of
leather
of
wood
smoke
and
even
the
delicate
musty
smell
of
the
rich
yellowed
paper
of
old
books
mingled
with
the
hazy
fragrance
of
a
turkish
cigarette
nancy
was
too
much
concerned
with
her
own
thoughts
to
wonder
where
the
source
of
that
comfortable
aroma
tobacco
lay
it
was
to
her
just
a
part
of
the
atmosphere
of
books
and
quiet
and
leather
chairs
which
she
always
associated
with
her
memories
of
her
father
revelling
in
the
sensation
of
being
alone
as
she
blissfully
fancied
herself
to
be
she
wandered
about
looking
at
the
titles
of
the
books
now
and
again
taking
down
a
volume
and
turning
the
leaves
here
she
chanced
upon
a
delightful
old
edition
of
pickwick
papers
bound
in
worn
leather
there
a
copy
of
the
vicar
of
wakefield
with
yellowed
pages
and
quaint
print
and
the
sight
of
these
old
friends
associated
as
they
were
with
the
happiest
and
most
tranquil
hours
of
her
life
soothed
to
a
certain
extent
her
feelings
which
had
been
cruelly
wounded
by
the
conversation
she
had
overheard
but
she
was
still
sore
and
angry
still
holding
the
vicar
of
wakefield
in
her
hand
she
stood
staring
absently
into
the
fire
so
that
what
people
will
be
saying
about
us
that
we
are
pushing
and
scheming
and
and
trying
to
make
friends
just
to
use
them
for
our
advantage
she
thought
bitterly
recalling
unfriendly
little
insinuation
sensitive
and
proud
as
she
was
that
unfinished
remark
made
in
the
cold
hard
tone
of
a
woman
who
judging
the
whole
world
by
herself
credited
everyone
alike
with
and
worldly
motives
had
inflicted
a
wound
that
would
be
long
in
healing
it
was
not
indeed
on
her
own
account
that
she
resented
it
so
bitterly
but
because
of
her
mother
and
alma
whose
actions
she
knew
could
be
so
misinterpreted
and
ascribed
to
quite
false
motives
she
knew
too
less
by
experience
than
by
instinct
that
beneath
all
the
pleasures
and
gaiety
which
alma
craved
so
eagerly
would
flow
that
bitter
undercurrent
of
cynical
comment
made
by
people
who
had
so
long
been
that
they
could
not
believe
in
the
artlessness
of
a
young
girl
simple
thirst
for
enjoyment
busy
with
these
thoughts
a
little
strange
and
mature
perhaps
for
her
age
she
was
quite
unconscious
of
two
interesting
facts
first
that
from
an
armchair
just
beyond
the
radius
of
the
lamplight
the
source
of
the
cigarette
smoke
was
regarding
her
with
mingled
astonishment
and
approval
and
second
that
she
herself
was
making
a
very
charming
picture
as
she
stood
in
the
deep
mellow
glow
of
the
firelight
a
small
man
with
a
kind
whimsical
clever
face
was
looking
at
her
with
a
pair
of
singularly
bright
brown
eyes
eyes
which
had
the
direct
unwavering
gentle
gaze
of
a
person
who
has
the
gift
of
reading
the
meaning
of
faces
and
expressions
to
which
others
are
blind
indeed
so
clearly
had
he
guessed
the
trend
of
the
thoughts
which
underlay
the
seriousness
of
nancy
sensitive
face
that
he
felt
almost
like
an
eavesdropper
suddenly
she
jerked
her
head
and
saw
him
he
stood
up
i
i
beg
your
pardon
he
apologized
still
with
the
sensation
of
having
heard
something
that
had
not
been
meant
for
his
ears
you
did
know
i
was
here
and
i
was
rather
at
a
loss
as
to
how
i
should
break
it
to
you
nancy
had
flushed
to
the
edge
of
her
hair
that
that
all
right
she
stammered
i
i
mean
i
should
apologize
to
you
you
were
reading
she
began
to
move
away
toward
the
door
again
but
he
stopped
her
hastily
you
must
go
and
you
must
for
a
moment
think
you
disturbed
me
i
have
any
business
to
be
in
here
anyway
because
i
think
i
was
invited
to
entertain
and
be
entertained
like
any
respectable
guest
i
do
know
what
they
do
to
unmannerly
unsociable
creatures
who
sneak
off
for
a
book
and
a
smoke
from
the
scenes
of
revelry
but
i
guilty
and
deserve
to
die
the
death
or
whatever
it
is
nancy
laughed
when
he
talked
he
had
a
droll
way
of
wrinkling
up
his
forehead
and
then
suddenly
breaking
into
a
beaming
mischievous
grin
like
a
schoolboy
i
guilty
too
yes
and
really
ever
so
much
more
so
than
i
am
because
deliberately
robbing
at
least
per
cent
of
the
guests
of
a
part
of
their
evening
pleasure
whereas
my
absence
is
of
so
little
importance
one
way
or
the
other
that
although
i
been
in
here
the
better
part
of
an
hour
already
there
has
been
even
a
whimper
of
protest
it
been
decidedly
injurious
to
my
i
had
hoped
when
you
came
in
that
you
had
been
sent
by
the
unanimous
vote
of
all
present
to
request
my
immediate
return
to
the
regions
of
festivity
i
was
prepared
to
be
coy
but
not
adamantine
imagine
my
chagrin
and
dismay
when
it
gradually
dawned
on
me
not
only
that
you
had
come
for
any
such
flattering
purpose
but
even
that
you
the
smallest
notion
i
was
here
as
far
as
you
were
concerned
i
was
of
less
significance
than
a
cockroach
but
that
not
bad
a
cockroach
would
be
of
awful
significance
to
me
said
nancy
with
a
laugh
we
have
caught
each
other
in
an
overwhelming
breach
of
manners
continued
he
severely
but
then
look
at
it
this
way
here
we
are
each
having
a
good
time
in
our
own
way
now
it
seems
to
me
that
a
hostess
could
ask
no
more
of
a
guest
than
that
he
find
his
own
entertainment
if
he
seeks
it
by
ambling
out
into
the
garden
to
weed
up
wild
onions
why
well
and
good
you
are
only
trying
to
dazzle
me
with
a
false
argument
in
said
nancy
you
should
be
grateful
to
me
for
furnishing
such
a
good
one
since
you
need
of
one
yourself
but
if
you
do
like
it
why
then
i
shall
change
my
mind
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
idea
of
dancing
has
suddenly
appealed
to
me
very
strongly
since
providence
has
at
last
provided
me
with
a
well
with
a
more
delightful
partner
than
i
should
have
dared
to
hope
for
and
they
are
playing
a
very
charming
waltz
will
you
dance
with
me
he
made
a
graceful
little
bow
and
offered
her
his
arm
then
he
smiled
i
i
have
introduced
myself
yet
do
you
mind
i
should
have
done
it
in
the
beginning
but
i
could
think
of
any
graceful
way
of
hinting
at
my
name
and
it
so
horribly
clumsy
just
to
say
pointblank
name
george
arnold
what
yours
but
there
is
any
other
way
answered
nancy
a
little
shyly
but
laughing
too
unless
we
both
go
to
porterbridge
and
ask
her
to
introduce
us
my
name
is
nancy
anne
prescott
there
now
it
perfectly
simple
is
it
i
never
could
understand
why
there
should
be
any
formal
about
telling
two
people
each
other
names
do
you
know
the
very
minute
you
came
in
perhaps
it
was
from
the
way
you
looked
at
those
dear
old
books
i
felt
as
if
well
as
if
we
ought
to
be
friends
you
are
fond
of
them
you
of
books
really
fond
of
them
i
love
those
old
shabby
ones
they
they
looked
so
very
friendly
he
stole
a
keen
glance
at
her
face
and
smiled
gently
at
what
it
told
him
then
as
she
clung
to
his
arm
he
guided
her
dexterously
through
the
crowd
to
the
dancing
floor
after
that
first
dance
the
whole
evening
changed
for
nancy
she
had
half
doubted
that
her
companion
would
be
a
good
dancer
but
in
two
moments
that
doubt
was
routed
gliding
smoothly
weightlessly
as
if
to
the
gentle
rhythm
of
a
wave
they
circled
through
the
moving
swarm
of
dancers
nancy
cheeks
flushing
like
two
poppies
and
her
eyes
glistening
with
the
exhilaration
of
the
music
her
timidity
had
left
her
she
felt
warm
vivacious
and
attractive
and
it
seemed
perfectly
natural
that
after
that
first
waltz
she
had
partners
for
every
dance
arnold
danced
with
no
one
else
when
other
partners
claimed
her
he
retired
to
the
doorway
and
stood
with
his
arms
folded
surveying
the
scene
with
his
whimsical
smile
but
evidently
he
regarded
it
as
his
right
to
have
each
waltz
with
her
my
aunt
has
ordered
me
to
present
you
to
her
he
said
when
he
had
at
length
led
her
into
a
corner
for
an
ice
and
a
moment
chat
for
some
reason
she
has
evidently
taken
a
great
fancy
to
you
at
sight
and
she
is
giving
me
no
peace
she
is
a
very
peremptory
and
badly
spoiled
old
lady
but
it
impossible
to
resist
her
i
told
her
that
she
might
frighten
you
to
death
and
that
then
you
blame
me
you
cried
nancy
horrified
indeed
i
did
i
had
the
experience
before
and
i
told
her
that
be
hanged
if
i
assumed
the
responsibility
of
surrendering
any
unsuspecting
person
into
her
clutches
without
giving
them
fair
warning
but
seriously
she
is
a
very
dear
lady
though
an
eccentric
one
and
she
has
been
saying
extremely
nice
things
about
you
besides
she
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
she
knew
your
father
and
that
loved
him
long
before
were
born
something
in
his
softened
gentle
tone
went
to
nancy
heart
she
put
down
her
ice
will
you
take
me
now
i
think
i
know
i
mean
i
seen
your
aunt
already
she
is
a
very
remarkable
person
she
can
be
more
terrifying
and
more
tender
than
any
woman
in
the
world
utterly
fearless
something
of
a
tyrant
possibly
because
she
has
never
been
denied
anything
she
wanted
in
her
life
she
simply
does
accept
denials
if
she
had
been
a
man
she
might
have
been
a
pitt
or
a
napoleon
as
she
is
she
is
a
mixture
of
queen
elizabeth
and
queen
victoria
the
amazing
individual
described
by
this
brief
biographical
preface
who
was
still
enthroned
on
the
coquettish
little
french
couch
and
who
was
now
consuming
a
pink
ice
with
naïve
relish
was
indeed
the
old
lady
in
purple
otherwise
miss
elizabeth
bancroft
of
lowry
house
for
some
reason
she
had
always
been
given
this
somewhat
english
style
of
designation
possibly
because
she
was
the
last
of
her
name
to
be
identified
with
the
magnificent
collections
for
which
lowry
house
the
american
of
aristocratic
english
colonists
had
been
famous
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
as
nancy
stood
before
her
she
looked
up
at
the
girl
keenly
her
little
blue
eyes
diminished
in
size
by
the
thick
lenses
of
her
then
she
handed
her
ice
to
arnold
without
even
glancing
at
him
and
held
out
both
her
plump
white
hands
to
nancy
her
whole
face
softened
with
the
dimpling
comfortable
smile
of
a
motherly
old
nurse
oh
my
dear
child
if
you
were
only
a
boy
i
could
believe
you
were
george
again
my
george
your
father
not
this
young
rascal
come
sit
down
beside
me
i
sha
keep
you
long
have
you
been
having
a
good
time
my
dear
she
was
not
a
terrible
old
lady
at
all
on
the
contrary
with
wonderful
skill
with
cosy
affectionate
little
ways
with
her
jolly
laugh
and
her
droll
stories
she
had
succeeded
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
in
completely
winning
nancy
to
her
and
somehow
although
she
appeared
to
be
doing
all
the
talking
herself
although
she
touched
so
lightly
and
so
adroitly
that
she
hardly
seemed
to
touch
at
all
on
any
topic
that
was
delicately
personal
to
the
girl
she
had
managed
within
a
brief
five
minutes
to
glean
a
hundred
little
facts
which
by
piecing
together
in
her
keen
old
mind
gave
her
more
knowledge
concerning
the
prescotts
than
another
person
could
have
come
by
in
a
week
diligent
pumping
george
my
dear
yes
aunt
eliza
oh
nothing
i
wish
to
goodness
you
were
a
woman
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
you
ca
possibly
understand
what
i
was
going
to
say
to
you
so
never
mind
about
listening
to
me
smoke
if
you
want
to
and
let
me
think
in
peace
very
well
from
arnold
docile
submissiveness
it
might
be
surmised
that
he
too
wanted
to
think
in
peace
miss
lumbering
impressive
coupé
rumbled
along
over
the
wet
roads
toward
lowry
house
its
two
occupants
buried
in
that
mood
of
silence
which
only
two
very
sympathetic
beings
know
how
to
respect
presently
miss
bancroft
burst
out
the
child
is
quite
charming
i
shall
give
tom
a
good
sound
piece
of
my
mind
george
arnold
grunted
it
only
fair
sportsmanship
to
give
him
twelve
hours
warning
poor
lallie
prescott
like
most
silly
women
she
going
to
try
to
beat
providence
by
pushing
them
forward
into
premature
rivalry
with
girls
who
have
every
financial
advantage
over
them
ruin
their
contentment
so
that
they
will
be
ready
to
fling
away
their
happiness
on
the
first
little
whippersnapper
who
looks
as
if
he
could
give
them
a
trip
to
paris
and
a
season
in
cannes
every
year
i
admire
her
fighting
spirit
but
it
hopelessly
misdirected
am
i
meant
to
understand
you
aunt
eliza
no
do
even
listen
to
me
nancy
has
too
much
sense
for
a
girl
of
her
age
and
that
exquisite
little
alma
has
none
i
find
that
i
must
interfere
chapter
vi
miss
bancroft
beards
the
ogre
miss
bancroft
had
not
made
her
solemn
declaration
lightly
she
never
made
any
announcements
of
her
intentions
without
weighty
consideration
consequently
she
was
a
woman
who
meant
what
she
said
and
meant
it
thoroughly
moreover
she
never
procrastinated
she
thought
in
a
straight
line
and
she
acted
in
a
straight
line
like
most
women
she
took
a
healthy
human
delight
in
interfering
but
unlike
the
majority
of
her
sex
she
indulged
very
rarely
when
however
she
had
made
up
her
mind
on
the
point
of
allowing
herself
to
concern
herself
in
other
people
business
she
experienced
the
exquisite
relish
of
a
strictly
gamester
who
allows
himself
to
play
only
rarely
so
that
he
may
enjoy
his
sport
with
that
peculiar
zest
which
only
long
abstinence
can
whet
on
a
sunny
warm
september
day
mellow
with
the
promise
of
an
indian
summer
miss
bancroft
smart
though
rotund
in
lavender
linen
set
out
on
her
pilgrimage
to
the
house
of
thomas
prescott
i
see
that
you
are
above
the
traditional
wiles
of
your
sex
aunt
commented
george
arnold
looking
up
from
his
book
and
surveying
her
with
twinkling
eyes
from
the
long
wicker
porch
chair
where
he
had
been
dozing
in
the
sun
you
rigged
yourself
out
in
full
panoply
that
a
jaunty
little
parasol
you
have
miss
bancroft
standing
on
the
broad
steps
put
up
her
parasol
at
this
to
shade
the
fine
texture
of
her
gaily
beflowered
straw
hat
from
the
sun
and
then
glanced
around
at
her
nephew
with
a
demure
smile
i
make
a
point
of
looking
my
best
always
when
i
going
to
see
tom
prescott
of
course
he
thinks
me
a
sensible
woman
a
remarkably
reasonable
woman
and
all
that
nonsense
but
i
like
to
leave
him
with
at
least
a
notion
that
i
surprisingly
well
preserved
even
if
i
have
rather
lost
my
there
was
a
time
you
know
the
demure
smile
quirked
the
corners
of
her
big
mobile
mouth
and
sparkled
impishly
in
her
eyes
then
with
a
little
wag
of
her
head
she
ran
down
the
steps
like
a
fat
jolly
schoolgirl
george
arnold
leaning
back
against
a
chintz
cushion
watched
the
portly
festive
figure
that
moved
away
under
the
trees
of
the
long
drive
miss
bancroft
usually
seemed
to
roll
slowly
but
efficiently
along
on
wheels
as
ponderous
and
impressive
as
an
he
caught
a
last
glimpse
of
lavender
and
white
through
the
shrubs
that
bordered
the
end
of
the
lawn
he
felt
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
this
pilgrimage
of
his
aunt
although
he
had
no
very
clear
idea
of
the
purpose
of
it
it
had
something
to
do
with
two
very
pretty
young
girls
whom
he
had
seen
at
an
otherwise
stupid
dance
the
night
before
one
of
the
girls
looked
like
a
dresden
doll
the
other
had
dark
eyes
and
a
direct
shy
almost
boyish
smile
her
name
was
anne
nancy
nancy
suited
her
much
better
he
had
thought
about
her
several
times
for
no
particular
reason
she
was
hardly
eighteen
and
he
was
well
he
was
though
that
was
neither
here
nor
there
it
was
simply
that
he
liked
her
rather
better
than
one
likes
most
girls
of
that
age
she
had
a
way
of
listening
to
a
man
without
that
stupid
flustered
expression
as
though
she
was
only
wondering
what
in
the
world
she
should
say
when
it
should
be
her
turn
to
talk
she
liked
books
he
wondered
if
she
knew
that
he
wrote
them
of
course
he
was
but
it
might
interest
her
to
know
that
he
was
the
george
arnold
whose
collections
of
exquisitely
delicate
children
stories
had
already
been
translated
into
six
foreign
languages
including
the
scandinavian
he
smiled
to
himself
at
the
naïve
vanity
which
had
prompted
this
thought
and
chastised
it
by
telling
himself
that
it
was
only
too
likely
that
her
ignorance
or
knowledge
of
what
he
did
or
was
were
matters
of
like
indifference
to
her
meantime
miss
bancroft
puffing
a
little
under
the
combined
difficulties
of
avoirdupois
and
a
beaming
september
sun
was
looking
with
an
almost
pathetic
anticipation
at
the
rich
cool
shadows
beneath
which
slept
the
rambling
mansion
of
thomas
prescott
i
shall
order
some
tea
a
man
is
always
so
much
more
amenable
to
reason
over
a
and
for
my
part
i
not
survive
half
an
hour
without
a
little
light
refreshment
i
suppose
i
have
to
listen
to
a
long
discourse
on
the
origin
of
the
slavic
races
or
the
religious
customs
of
the
aztecs
until
i
can
get
him
down
to
argue
with
me
on
his
duty
toward
his
fellow
creatures
i
hope
to
heaven
that
his
principles
are
drowsy
i
ca
bear
it
if
i
have
to
combat
a
lot
of
principles
it
absolutely
heathenish
to
have
principles
in
warm
weather
anyway
of
course
they
are
the
proper
things
to
have
but
dear
me
they
such
nuisances
it
all
right
to
have
them
about
yourself
i
suppose
but
to
have
them
about
other
people
is
priggish
and
quite
useless
so
far
as
i
can
see
my
observation
has
taught
me
that
if
you
like
a
person
it
makes
no
difference
whether
their
principles
coincide
with
your
own
or
not
or
even
if
they
have
none
at
all
and
if
you
do
like
a
person
it
downright
irritating
to
have
to
approve
of
them
miss
bancroft
mental
grammar
like
much
of
her
spoken
grammar
was
inaccurate
of
course
as
in
other
matters
she
held
rule
to
scorn
when
the
rule
interfered
with
her
personal
conception
of
what
she
was
trying
to
make
clear
to
other
people
or
to
herself
under
the
vigorous
thrust
of
her
plump
direct
forefinger
the
pealed
clearly
in
the
cool
remote
regions
of
the
house
standing
under
the
arch
of
the
norman
doorway
she
surveyed
the
broad
lawns
with
interest
and
a
sort
of
irritable
appreciation
somewhere
under
the
trees
a
gardener
was
raking
the
drive
and
burning
neat
piles
of
warm
brown
leaves
from
which
the
pungent
smoke
ascended
in
sinuous
blue
spirals
like
languorously
dancing
phantoms
of
the
dead
leaves
and
the
pleasant
rhythmic
sound
of
the
rake
on
the
gravel
intensified
the
sober
peaceful
silence
peculiar
to
that
domain
the
door
was
opened
tell
prescott
that
it
miss
bancroft
nonsense
i
sha
sit
down
in
the
at
all
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
member
of
the
ladies
aid
come
to
petition
a
subscription
for
a
new
church
carpet
or
something
tell
prescott
that
i
be
out
on
the
porch
will
you
come
through
this
way
then
madam
suggested
the
old
butler
meekly
miss
bancroft
followed
him
sighing
a
little
with
relief
as
the
coolness
of
the
great
hall
with
its
smell
of
old
polished
wood
and
waxed
floors
closed
about
her
and
william
she
called
pathetically
after
the
retreating
butler
do
put
the
kettle
on
on
her
way
through
the
house
she
passed
a
stately
succession
of
large
rooms
a
handsome
with
a
polished
parquetry
floor
fit
for
the
dainty
crimson
heels
of
a
laced
and
furbelowed
french
coquette
its
great
glass
chandelier
shrouded
in
white
tarlatan
the
with
walls
on
which
hung
three
or
four
astonishingly
valuable
and
even
beautiful
pictures
by
masters
of
the
eighteenth
century
english
school
for
all
its
impressive
grandeur
the
long
table
covered
with
a
rare
piece
of
italian
brocade
was
with
the
single
carved
chair
set
at
the
distant
end
a
barren
table
indeed
for
a
man
whom
miss
bancroft
knew
to
be
possessed
of
one
of
the
warmest
tenderest
and
most
hearts
in
the
whole
world
principles
fiddlesticks
she
observed
aloud
tst
a
in
which
no
one
ever
lived
a
in
which
no
one
ever
wrote
and
long
halls
wainscoted
in
dark
oak
and
quiet
as
those
of
a
college
library
whose
silence
was
never
broken
by
the
light
staccato
footsteps
of
gay
feet
or
the
murmur
of
roguish
voices
but
the
air
of
pathos
which
all
these
things
wore
seemed
to
rise
from
the
fact
that
they
had
been
planned
and
secured
not
for
the
enjoyment
of
a
lonely
old
man
but
for
some
happy
purpose
that
had
never
been
realized
they
seemed
to
wear
an
expression
of
disappointment
even
of
apology
for
existing
so
uselessly
tut
how
can
anyone
be
patient
with
a
man
of
principles
again
commented
miss
bancroft
but
her
face
had
grown
a
little
sad
she
was
rocking
gently
back
and
forth
in
the
shade
of
the
cool
stone
porch
when
the
sound
of
footsteps
at
last
reached
her
ears
and
she
looked
up
with
the
warm
smile
of
a
guest
who
knows
she
is
always
welcome
elizabeth
this
is
a
very
great
pleasure
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
me
you
deserve
to
be
forgotten
my
dear
friend
ah
now
you
disarmed
me
though
i
just
conscience
enough
to
have
to
tell
you
that
come
this
time
with
ulterior
motives
i
can
find
fault
with
no
motives
of
yours
so
long
as
they
prompt
you
to
visit
me
i
look
forward
to
my
little
chats
with
you
as
a
child
looks
forward
to
his
saturday
treats
my
dear
tom
your
gift
of
saying
delightful
things
is
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
age
here
you
never
see
a
woman
from
one
year
end
to
the
other
and
yet
you
can
turn
a
compliment
as
charmingly
as
though
you
practised
on
the
fairest
in
the
land
every
evening
of
your
life
my
youth
said
the
father
quoted
the
old
gentleman
with
a
twinkle
however
let
hear
your
ulterior
motives
first
my
dear
elizabeth
so
that
afterwards
we
can
chat
with
unburdened
minds
no
no
i
refuse
to
beard
you
until
we
have
some
tea
thank
goodness
here
william
bringing
it
now
i
took
the
liberty
of
ordering
it
tom
you
took
no
liberties
at
all
you
merely
assumed
your
privileges
tea
you
women
with
all
your
notions
and
your
injurious
habits
how
very
delightful
it
is
to
be
near
you
to
hear
you
talk
tom
how
could
suspect
that
you
were
a
man
of
principles
cried
miss
bancroft
how
could
anyone
dream
that
you
were
hard
and
austere
and
and
unimaginative
he
looked
at
her
in
mild
astonishment
he
was
a
small
old
man
rather
delicate
in
build
with
the
blunt
broad
hands
of
a
worker
and
a
high
smooth
massive
forehead
from
which
his
perfectly
white
hair
fell
back
long
and
almost
childishly
soft
and
fine
his
eyes
set
deep
under
the
sharply
defined
bone
of
his
projecting
brow
wore
the
gentle
expression
noticeable
in
many
people
but
his
chin
contradicted
their
softness
and
there
was
a
hint
of
obstinacy
in
his
mouth
and
rather
long
upper
lip
he
was
dressed
negligently
and
indeed
almost
shabbily
and
he
made
no
apologies
for
his
appearance
since
he
never
gave
a
thought
to
it
himself
he
could
not
consider
what
other
people
might
think
of
it
his
greatest
hobby
lingering
with
him
from
earlier
years
was
chemistry
and
he
spent
virtually
all
his
time
in
the
laboratory
which
he
had
fitted
up
in
one
of
the
odd
towers
that
decorated
his
house
his
coat
and
trousers
would
have
given
a
far
less
observant
person
than
sherlock
holmes
a
clue
to
this
favorite
occupation
of
his
stained
and
burned
as
they
were
with
acids
do
you
eat
your
in
those
clothes
demanded
miss
bancroft
why
what
the
matter
with
them
why
not
eat
dinner
in
my
dear
elizabeth
surely
at
this
late
date
you
have
taken
it
into
your
head
to
reform
my
habits
i
do
know
but
that
i
have
replied
miss
bancroft
with
a
touch
of
grimness
is
that
your
ulterior
motive
i
suspected
it
tell
me
what
you
meant
when
you
accused
me
just
now
of
being
hard
and
austere
and
unimaginative
why
unimaginative
no
really
intelligent
woman
would
ever
try
to
explain
anything
so
subtle
to
a
man
i
mean
that
you
are
unimaginative
because
you
allow
yourself
to
be
rigid
rigid
rigid
about
what
about
your
principles
i
like
you
tom
you
know
how
much
i
admire
you
more
than
any
man
i
have
ever
known
and
i
have
known
a
good
many
remarkable
men
but
one
thing
i
can
not
forgive
you
is
your
principles
my
principles
when
did
i
ever
offend
you
with
principles
miss
bancroft
poured
herself
another
cup
of
tea
and
laid
a
second
piece
of
neatly
on
the
side
of
her
saucer
come
said
prescott
with
a
keen
glance
at
her
come
it
not
like
you
elizabeth
to
beat
about
the
bush
what
can
this
matter
be
which
you
find
so
difficult
to
broach
in
plain
english
miss
bancroft
hesitated
a
moment
it
touched
her
vanity
to
be
accused
of
beating
about
the
bush
since
she
took
an
especial
pride
in
her
reputation
of
being
a
woman
who
never
minced
matters
and
who
always
made
a
direct
and
fearless
attack
then
she
said
simply
i
came
to
talk
to
you
about
george
daughters
tom
there
was
a
short
silence
it
not
like
you
elizabeth
to
to
touch
upon
a
matter
so
very
delicate
remarked
prescott
quietly
his
lips
tightening
slightly
of
course
i
can
understand
how
my
attitude
in
regard
to
them
must
appear
to
you
but
i
fancied
that
there
existed
between
you
and
me
a
silent
agreement
that
this
was
one
subject
which
was
never
to
be
mentioned
my
dear
tom
you
know
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
am
not
an
interfering
woman
therefore
you
must
realize
that
i
should
never
have
spoken
of
this
to
you
without
the
best
of
reasons
for
doing
so
but
i
feel
that
you
are
allowing
certain
principles
excellent
no
doubt
in
themselves
but
wrong
in
your
particular
application
to
them
to
thwart
your
own
happiness
to
say
nothing
of
depriving
others
of
the
advantages
which
it
is
in
your
power
to
bestow
miss
bancroft
was
very
serious
now
as
she
spoke
she
leaned
over
and
laid
her
fat
little
hand
earnestly
on
the
old
man
shabby
sleeve
he
said
nothing
and
she
continued
there
are
two
young
girls
charming
beautiful
indeed
the
daughters
of
a
man
you
loved
far
more
even
than
most
fathers
love
their
sons
do
exclaimed
prescott
sharply
almost
fiercely
speak
to
me
of
that
elizabeth
ca
you
realize
that
just
to
mention
my
george
recalls
all
my
old
rancor
against
that
little
heartless
spendthrift
who
ruined
him
him
his
voice
rose
hoarsely
then
making
an
effort
to
control
himself
he
went
on
in
a
quieter
tone
it
very
difficult
for
me
to
discuss
this
with
you
elizabeth
i
sorry
tom
but
you
have
no
right
to
it
a
matter
of
your
own
happiness
as
much
as
theirs
and
i
would
be
no
friend
of
yours
if
i
were
not
willing
and
anxious
to
risk
your
anger
for
the
sake
of
righting
this
mistake
you
are
making
my
nieces
are
not
in
want
and
familiarity
with
a
certain
degree
of
poverty
is
the
source
of
a
wisdom
that
safeguards
men
and
women
from
follies
that
lead
to
many
of
the
greatest
miseries
on
earth
want
my
dear
tom
is
a
purely
relative
condition
said
miss
bancroft
there
are
needs
which
to
certain
natures
are
more
intolerable
than
physical
hunger
to
deprive
a
young
girl
of
simple
innocent
delights
companionship
of
her
own
kind
dainty
clothes
harmless
enjoyments
is
like
robbing
a
plant
of
sun
and
rain
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
poverty
need
deprive
any
girl
of
such
things
nonsense
elizabeth
i
have
seen
girls
who
had
but
two
dresses
to
their
name
who
worked
and
struggled
and
economized
and
who
nevertheless
had
as
much
pleasure
indeed
more
i
wager
than
the
most
petted
heiress
in
the
land
and
what
more
they
made
better
wives
and
better
mothers
and
better
citizens
they
knew
how
many
cents
make
a
dollar
and
how
many
dollars
their
men
could
make
in
a
week
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
working
not
eight
hours
a
day
but
ten
and
twelve
one
never
heard
this
sickly
whine
from
them
this
talk
that
women
must
be
coddled
and
pampered
and
that
men
can
eat
their
hearts
out
to
provide
the
in
which
they
bask
like
pet
lizards
they
did
ask
for
they
asked
only
that
they
might
work
and
save
with
their
husbands
that
they
could
be
fit
partners
and
they
found
their
joy
not
in
clothes
and
enjoyments
but
in
giving
their
strength
and
their
courage
for
their
husbands
and
their
children
prescott
had
risen
to
his
feet
in
the
vehemence
of
his
feeling
and
was
walking
back
and
forth
his
hands
locked
behind
his
back
and
his
head
lowered
and
thrust
forward
between
his
shoulders
good
heavens
i
got
him
roused
for
fair
thought
miss
bancroft
with
a
mixture
of
amusement
and
dismay
and
of
course
theoretically
he
dead
right
now
why
is
it
that
so
many
things
which
theoretically
are
dead
right
practically
are
all
wrong
that
what
i
got
to
prove
to
him
and
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
succeed
after
all
i
must
take
care
not
to
be
sentimental
that
rouses
him
dreadfully
aloud
she
said
in
a
quiet
voice
listen
tom
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
should
agree
with
you
absolutely
but
a
short
time
ago
i
spoke
of
want
being
relative
you
said
that
your
nieces
are
not
in
want
you
meant
of
course
that
they
had
food
and
clothes
and
shelter
if
they
were
girls
who
lived
in
an
absolutely
different
plane
of
life
that
would
be
sufficient
for
their
happiness
they
could
have
pleasure
with
their
two
dresses
and
their
one
best
bonnet
because
everyone
else
of
their
class
would
have
no
more
but
take
one
of
them
out
of
that
class
put
her
where
her
only
companions
would
have
to
be
sought
for
among
men
and
women
who
lived
on
a
scale
of
comparative
wealth
where
to
make
friends
she
would
have
to
appear
well
and
so
on
then
what
in
the
first
case
was
at
least
a
sufficiency
now
becomes
tragically
inadequate
there
is
no
cure
but
for
that
girl
to
recede
from
the
class
to
which
by
birth
breeding
and
instinct
she
belongs
you
have
built
up
a
great
fortune
you
yourself
are
what
you
boast
of
being
a
man
a
man
originally
of
the
people
but
you
made
your
nephew
a
gentleman
understand
that
i
am
using
the
word
in
the
commonest
sense
consequently
his
children
belong
to
a
class
in
which
needs
must
be
measured
by
a
different
scale
from
that
used
for
working
women
they
live
as
you
do
and
most
likely
because
you
do
in
a
very
rich
community
they
suffer
from
wants
that
girls
of
a
different
class
would
never
know
they
are
deprived
of
things
which
your
working
girl
would
not
be
deprived
of
they
are
poorer
on
their
two
thousand
a
year
or
whatever
it
is
than
a
peasant
woman
would
be
on
two
hundred
because
their
particular
needs
are
more
expensive
they
will
be
very
rich
after
i
die
said
prescott
in
a
low
voice
after
a
short
pause
but
i
wo
let
them
even
suspect
it
that
little
wife
of
george
i
never
want
to
see
her
again
she
is
a
great
little
gambler
if
she
felt
sure
that
in
a
few
years
her
daughters
were
coming
into
a
fortune
of
several
millions
heaven
only
knows
but
that
she
have
the
last
cent
of
it
spent
in
advance
you
seem
to
have
gleaned
an
immense
amount
of
information
concerning
my
nieces
perhaps
you
know
what
her
plans
for
them
are
you
know
tom
that
i
was
as
much
opposed
indeed
more
opposed
perhaps
than
you
were
to
george
marrying
lallie
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
now
i
am
afraid
that
she
is
well
attempting
things
for
her
girls
that
lie
beyond
her
income
you
must
not
blame
her
she
is
a
wise
woman
but
i
am
sure
that
she
is
one
who
suffers
more
for
her
mistakes
than
she
causes
others
to
suffer
of
course
i
am
no
judge
of
that
she
is
a
little
gambler
no
doubt
as
you
said
but
a
gallant
one
she
is
playing
against
rather
desperate
odds
and
she
can
not
be
blamed
if
she
plays
foolishly
as
i
understand
it
i
believe
that
her
object
is
to
give
her
girls
by
hook
or
crook
advantages
that
lie
beyond
her
means
the
goal
being
that
one
of
them
or
both
will
marry
well
if
she
wins
well
and
good
well
and
good
fiddlesticks
nonsense
good
heavens
shouted
prescott
whatever
are
you
driving
at
elizabeth
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
all
this
talking
you
come
to
me
telling
me
that
my
nieces
are
in
want
of
some
kind
or
other
that
that
mother
of
theirs
is
living
beyond
her
means
in
her
attempt
to
put
them
on
a
footing
with
the
daughters
of
millionaires
so
that
they
can
marry
some
mother
son
whom
they
fancy
can
stand
their
extravagance
and
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
you
want
me
to
defray
their
expenses
so
that
the
business
of
ruining
some
other
man
boy
as
mine
was
ruined
will
be
less
difficult
for
them
have
you
gone
clean
daft
i
see
i
have
made
myself
perfectly
clear
said
miss
bancroft
patiently
i
should
have
told
you
that
i
saw
both
of
your
nieces
last
night
it
was
because
of
the
older
one
that
i
came
here
nancy
she
looks
enough
like
george
to
make
your
heart
ache
and
she
is
facing
poor
george
problem
she
is
a
very
remarkable
young
girl
i
do
cotton
to
the
average
young
miss
very
readily
as
you
know
but
there
was
something
in
that
bright
eager
young
face
that
went
to
my
heart
she
was
at
the
porterbridges
they
came
in
an
old
hack
that
they
were
ashamed
of
do
you
like
to
think
of
george
daughters
doing
that
she
is
a
girl
who
deserves
a
fair
chance
and
she
not
getting
it
but
she
is
the
sort
that
whimpers
she
struck
me
as
being
full
of
a
fine
courage
and
an
independence
of
spirit
that
made
one
member
of
the
family
the
very
troublesome
person
he
is
she
is
a
girl
who
has
her
teeth
set
against
circumstance
and
her
own
cool
sober
views
of
life
but
she
is
very
young
too
young
to
have
to
cope
with
the
difficulties
that
face
her
and
far
too
proud
to
accept
any
help
with
strings
tied
to
it
remember
that
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
sin
and
a
shame
that
you
who
could
give
her
the
help
she
needs
and
who
could
get
a
great
deal
of
happiness
in
return
you
wo
even
see
her
i
not
asking
anything
but
that
you
see
and
talk
to
nancy
sometime
miss
bancroft
rose
and
shook
out
her
skirt
prescott
stood
looking
straight
ahead
of
him
with
his
under
lip
thrust
forward
a
characteristic
trick
of
that
same
nancy
if
he
but
knew
it
presently
he
turned
and
held
out
his
hand
with
a
queer
almost
shy
smile
do
forgive
me
elizabeth
for
bellowing
at
you
as
i
have
you
know
my
dear
girl
and
you
have
often
agreed
with
me
that
while
at
my
death
my
nieces
will
become
very
rich
it
has
been
my
purpose
to
allow
them
to
know
poverty
with
all
its
sorrows
and
harassments
so
that
they
can
use
my
fortune
wisely
for
their
own
happiness
and
for
the
happiness
of
the
families
that
they
will
have
in
time
my
theory
is
right
but
circumstances
alter
cases
i
shall
think
over
what
you
have
said
but
i
shall
promise
nothing
miss
bancroft
accepted
his
hand
and
pressed
it
affectionately
well
then
no
do
bother
to
open
the
door
for
me
go
this
way
he
smiled
at
her
again
as
she
went
down
the
steps
i
always
feel
lonely
when
you
have
gone
even
when
we
have
been
quarrelling
he
remarked
with
a
wistful
look
of
course
you
feel
lonely
you
roll
around
in
that
huge
house
of
yours
like
a
hazelnut
in
a
shoe
returned
miss
bancroft
quickly
he
caught
her
meaning
and
as
quickly
replied
nonsense
i
like
plenty
of
room
never
could
bear
to
have
a
lot
of
people
hanging
around
no
man
can
accomplish
anything
with
an
army
of
women
and
things
hanging
to
his
tst
observed
miss
bancroft
and
because
there
was
no
answer
to
that
she
could
retire
with
the
satisfaction
of
having
had
the
last
word
chapter
vii
a
man
of
principles
one
dozen
stockings
six
woolen
and
six
silk
imagine
owning
six
pairs
of
silk
stockings
nighties
do
they
look
luxurious
all
beribboned
and
fluffy
one
thick
sweater
one
pair
of
stout
boots
i
hope
these
boots
are
stout
enough
they
look
as
if
they
could
kick
a
hole
through
the
side
of
a
one
mackintosh
now
where
under
the
sun
can
i
put
this
mackintosh
oh
just
roll
it
up
in
a
bundle
and
slam
it
in
that
corner
near
your
shoes
it
keep
from
bumping
around
my
dear
you
look
as
if
you
been
in
a
tornado
a
tornado
i
a
tornado
nancy
lifted
a
flushed
face
and
gazed
at
alma
through
a
haze
of
tumbled
hair
then
she
sat
back
on
her
heels
in
front
of
the
open
trunk
and
seizing
her
locks
near
the
temples
pulled
them
frenziedly
alma
prescott
if
you
sit
there
another
moment
looking
calm
i
throw
this
at
you
do
anything
scream
run
around
in
circles
pant
anything
but
look
calm
every
minute
i
forgetting
something
vital
let
me
see
if
you
go
over
that
formula
again
i
be
a
mopping
mowing
idiot
observed
alma
serenely
from
the
i
wonder
how
one
mops
and
mows
it
sounds
awfully
idiotic
does
it
i
saw
you
put
the
the
the
in
the
tray
there
corner
now
for
goodness
sake
forget
about
them
it
just
little
things
like
that
that
unhinge
the
greatest
minds
you
horribly
bad
company
while
you
packing
a
trunk
well
anyhow
it
nearly
done
now
and
yours
is
ready
you
a
lamb
for
doing
mine
for
me
i
have
been
a
bit
of
help
i
know
oh
you
it
going
to
be
glorious
fun
at
boarding
school
i
always
longed
to
go
to
boarding
school
and
it
awfully
strict
at
miss
leland
elise
porterbridge
says
they
have
midnight
feasts
and
all
sorts
of
things
and
then
you
know
frank
barrows
is
at
harvard
and
he
asked
me
up
there
for
some
dance
near
christmas
do
you
think
frank
is
very
nice
nancy
this
was
what
alma
had
been
leading
around
to
and
nancy
knew
it
personally
she
thought
frank
rather
an
affected
youth
but
she
had
sense
enough
not
to
air
this
opinion
before
alma
just
then
why
yes
he
seems
very
nice
she
replied
with
very
mild
interest
i
think
he
has
sort
of
more
to
him
than
most
men
of
his
age
pursued
alma
affecting
a
judicial
air
probably
he
has
he
dances
beautifully
goodness
i
had
a
wonderful
time
the
other
night
i
know
that
you
probably
think
it
wrong
of
me
but
i
like
nothing
more
than
to
go
to
a
party
like
that
every
night
in
the
week
do
think
it
wrong
at
all
only
i
think
you
probably
get
awfully
sick
of
it
in
a
little
while
and
and
the
chief
trouble
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
that
it
so
dreadfully
expensive
i
know
you
think
i
always
harping
on
the
same
string
but
do
you
remember
the
motto
of
micawber
one
pound
expenditure
nineteen
shillings
and
sixpence
product
happiness
income
one
pound
expenditure
one
pound
and
sixpence
product
misery
well
i
know
that
very
sensible
but
there
lots
of
sense
to
drink
and
be
merry
for
we
die
returned
alma
with
a
gay
laugh
you
thinking
about
my
dress
and
slippers
i
could
have
killed
that
person
who
spilt
their
fruit
punch
all
over
my
skirt
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
about
it
and
besides
i
sure
i
can
hide
the
stain
with
a
sash
or
something
i
do
believe
in
worrying
with
this
madame
optimist
turned
and
pressing
her
short
nose
against
the
window
pane
drummed
with
her
little
pink
nails
against
the
wet
glass
the
rain
was
falling
again
in
a
monotonous
drenching
downpour
stripping
the
trees
of
the
few
brown
shivering
leaves
that
clung
to
the
dripping
branches
the
promise
of
indian
summer
seemed
to
have
been
definitely
broken
for
reasons
of
dame
nature
own
and
the
weather
was
having
a
tantrum
about
it
but
inside
the
little
bedroom
was
all
the
cosier
in
contrast
to
the
woebegone
gloom
of
the
early
dusk
the
chintz
window
curtains
of
nancy
making
were
faded
by
many
washings
it
is
true
and
the
two
white
iron
bedsteads
might
have
looked
sprucer
for
a
coat
of
paint
but
with
a
fire
glowing
in
the
grate
and
sending
out
an
almost
affectionate
glint
upon
all
the
familiar
objects
the
little
room
had
an
air
of
motherly
cheerfulness
and
comfort
a
shabby
but
inviting
armchair
stood
in
front
of
the
hearth
in
a
corner
a
white
bookcase
harbored
a
family
of
volumes
ranging
from
grimm
fairy
tales
and
stepping
stones
to
english
literature
to
the
three
musketeers
and
jane
eyre
all
tattered
and
thumbed
and
seeming
to
wear
the
happy
weary
expression
of
a
rag
doll
that
has
been
loved
to
death
well
nancy
was
saying
in
reply
to
alma
observation
i
believe
in
worrying
but
i
do
believe
in
having
an
umbrella
if
you
live
in
a
rainy
climate
then
you
do
have
to
worry
about
the
rain
i
comprenez
you
are
talking
in
symbols
are
you
where
mother
here
i
am
darling
replied
prescott
from
the
doorway
dear
me
the
trunks
are
all
packed
are
they
nancy
what
a
wonderful
child
you
are
oh
whatever
am
i
going
to
do
without
my
daughters
this
time
night
we
all
be
dying
of
the
blues
thank
goodness
here
hannah
with
some
tea
i
starving
said
nancy
springing
up
to
take
the
tray
from
the
hands
of
the
fat
old
woman
who
had
just
made
her
appearance
her
full
solemn
red
face
looming
behind
the
teapot
they
all
gathered
around
the
fire
nancy
and
alma
settling
on
the
floor
and
immediately
opening
a
disastrous
attack
on
the
plate
of
chocolate
cake
hannah
prize
contribution
to
this
farewell
feast
this
time
night
we
probably
be
regaling
ourselves
on
baked
beans
and
cold
added
alma
cramming
chocolate
cake
into
her
mouth
like
a
greedy
child
that
an
awful
thought
now
miss
ye
do
suppose
they
be
feedin
ye
bad
exclaimed
hannah
in
great
concern
the
old
woman
had
taken
her
stand
respectfully
near
the
doorway
loath
to
lose
the
last
few
glimpses
of
her
adored
young
mistresses
if
ye
think
that
now
i
can
send
ye
a
box
of
jellies
and
the
like
any
time
ye
say
well
they
probably
give
us
something
more
than
bread
and
water
but
not
much
replied
nancy
seriously
they
do
believe
in
giving
students
much
to
eat
because
it
hampers
their
brains
is
that
so
now
marvelled
hannah
it
is
indeed
it
a
scientific
fact
hannah
when
we
come
back
for
the
christmas
holidays
we
probably
be
so
pale
and
wan
that
we
even
cast
a
shadow
but
goodness
how
clever
we
be
i
a
great
believer
in
good
feedin
commented
hannah
dubiously
and
i
do
cotton
much
to
scientifics
if
you
pardon
me
miss
lord
what
an
empty
house
be
without
ye
i
hope
you
are
insinuating
that
we
take
up
much
room
laughed
nancy
she
was
teasing
hannah
to
cover
up
her
own
growing
sensation
of
homesickness
and
uneasiness
take
good
care
of
mother
hannah
and
do
let
her
go
out
without
her
rubbers
on
and
and
make
her
write
to
us
every
single
day
it
ridiculous
i
suppose
to
talk
as
if
we
were
going
twelve
hundred
instead
of
twelve
miles
but
we
never
been
even
twelve
miles
away
from
home
before
yes
and
there
nothing
like
seeing
something
of
the
world
to
broaden
a
person
observed
alma
sagely
when
i
grown
up
i
shall
certainly
travel
i
intend
to
make
a
tour
of
the
world
egypt
especially
goodness
i
like
to
go
to
egypt
that
edith
palliser
was
a
lucky
girl
her
guardian
took
her
to
paris
and
rome
and
cairo
and
even
to
algiers
and
she
met
all
kinds
of
interesting
people
a
spanish
prince
and
a
russian
count
and
loads
of
artists
and
writers
and
things
i
afraid
that
we
must
be
terribly
provincial
ah
now
do
say
that
remonstrated
hannah
who
had
no
idea
what
provincial
meant
and
was
consequently
convinced
that
it
must
mean
something
very
bad
indeed
bless
my
soul
there
the
bell
now
who
could
be
comin
here
on
a
day
like
this
the
had
indeed
been
rung
fiercely
and
a
second
ring
followed
impatiently
upon
the
first
hannah
vanished
who
in
the
world
wondered
nancy
sh
it
some
man
alma
sprang
up
and
running
out
into
the
hall
leaned
curiously
over
the
bannister
in
a
moment
she
returned
looking
as
if
she
had
seen
a
ghost
her
mouth
open
and
her
eyes
popping
nancy
mother
i
think
it
nonsense
but
nancy
too
scrambled
to
her
feet
and
stood
listening
with
suspended
breath
mother
no
my
dear
it
it
be
prescott
had
turned
quite
pale
it
must
be
just
some
tradesman
see
there
hannah
now
but
hannah
face
confirmed
the
dazing
suspicion
without
even
announcing
the
stupifying
news
she
leaned
weakly
against
the
doorway
and
pressed
her
hand
to
her
ample
bosom
signifying
an
overwhelming
agitation
who
is
it
hannah
the
saints
protect
us
miss
sure
it
the
old
gentleman
himself
as
large
as
life
indeed
the
missis
home
says
he
and
before
i
can
draw
breath
her
prescott
is
waitin
on
her
and
would
like
to
see
the
young
ladies
says
he
and
he
sticks
his
soakin
umbrella
in
the
corner
and
without
takin
off
his
overshoes
stalks
into
the
says
he
seein
the
hole
in
the
carpet
dangerous
i
like
to

like
a

at
his
lips
and
kinda
talkin
to
hisself
what
shall

be
tellin

this
bomb

to
have
paralyzed
the
little
family
i

stammered
prescott
looking
piteously
at
nancy
for
help
you
better
go
right
down
mother
why
you
look
frightened
to
death
dear
i

be
very
nice
said
nancy
reassuringly
come
along
do
keep
him
waiting
here
just
tuck
up
your
hair
a
bit
come
on
alma
inwardly
quaking
but
outwardly
preserving
a
dignified
composure
the
three
descended
the
staircase
with
the
calmness
of
people
going
to
some
inevitable
fate
he
ca
bite
you
dear
whispered
nancy
to
her
mother
with
a
nervous
little
giggle
prescott
was
standing
perfectly
still
with
his
back
toward
the
door
staring
with
an
evidently
absorbed
interest
at
the
wall
in
front
of
him
he
turned
slowly
as
prescott
entered
the
room
and
for
a
moment
surveyed
her
and
the
two
girls
without
speaking
then
he
said
casually
lallie
alma
shot
a
glance
at
nancy
uncle
thomas
said
prescott
in
a
rather
faint
voice
and
flushing
crimson
with
nervousness
it
it
is
very
kind
of
you
not
at
all
he
interrupted
brusquely
not
at
all
may
we
have
a
light
it
is
rather
dark
nancy
quickly
lit
the
gas
and
as
the
light
from
the
jet
shone
down
on
her
upturned
face
the
old
man
scrutinized
her
keenly
a
queer
but
repressed
expression
changed
the
lines
in
his
stern
old
face
for
a
moment
then
he
looked
at
alma
who
was
regarding
him
with
perfectly
unconcealed
terror
and
awe
how
do
you
do
he
said
to
her
holding
out
his
hand
how
do
you
do
you
my
niece
alma
eh
anne
is
the
one
who
looks
like
like
my
nephew
and
alma
is
the
one
who
resembles
her
mother
he
said
this
as
if
he
were
repeating
some
directions
to
himself
i
have
seen
you
since
you
were
children
he
shook
alma
hand
formally
and
sat
down
at
prescott
timid
invitation
the
short
silence
which
ensued
while
it
seemed
like
an
age
of
discomfort
to
the
prescotts
apparently
was
unobserved
by
him
it
has
been
a
very
long
time
since
since
i
have
seen
you
uncle
thomas
said
prescott
in
desperation
quite
aware
that
this
remark
like
any
one
she
should
make
just
then
was
a
very
awkward
one
yes
i
never
go
out
madam
so
this
is
anne
nancy
eh
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
girl
and
met
her
clear
steady
eyes
sharply
you
were
a
child
a
very
little
girl
when
i
saw
you
last
you
resemble
my
nephew
very
much
my
my
dear
no
doubt
madam
you
are
wondering
at
the
reason
of
this
visit
he
said
all
at
once
plunging
into
the
heart
of
matters
with
an
air
of
impatience
at
any
beating
about
the
bush
i
no
doubt
it
was
the
last
thing
in
the
world
you
expected
eh
it
was
indeed
a
surprise
murmured
prescott
i
realized
that
my
grandnieces
are
growing
up
and
i
had
a
curiosity
to
see
them
there
is
the
kernel
of
the
matter
they
are
handsome
girls
i
suppose
everyone
knows
that
they
have
a
rich
uncle
and
prospects
eh
neither
my
daughters
nor
anyone
else
has
been
deluded
in
that
respect
answered
prescott
with
a
touch
of
spirit
hum
well
that
good
i
should
say
nothing
puts
anyone
in
such
a
false
position
as
to
be
generally
regarded
as
having
prospects
ruinous
especially
for
girls
my
daughters
have
been
taught
that
they
must
rely
entirely
on
themselves
you
need
not
have
come
to
repeat
the
lesson
to
them
uncle
thomas
returned
prescott
trying
to
conceal
her
temper
prescott
affected
not
to
notice
her
rising
annoyance
which
was
a
natural
enough
reaction
from
her
earlier
nervousness
instead
he
next
addressed
himself
directly
to
alma
so
you
think
i
a
regular
old
ogre
do
you
my
dear
his
eyes
suddenly
twinkled
at
her
palpable
terror
and
distress
but
only
nancy
caught
the
twinkle
you
think
i
a
queer
crotchety
old
fellow
eh
well
do
let
talk
about
me
i
want
to
know
what
you
are
planning
to
do
with
yourselves
an
old
man
curiosity
your
face
is
your
fortune
my
dear
though
a
pretty
face
is
not
infrequently
a
misfortune
so
the
wiseacres
say
i
understand
that
you
two
young
ladies
are
going
now
to
a
fashionable
school
to
learn
how
to
be
fashionable
no
doubt
that
a
folly
it
would
be
better
if
you
stayed
at
home
and
learned
how
to
cook
and
darn
we
cook
and
darn
said
nancy
demurely
so
good
now
tell
me
why
are
you
going
to
this
school
it
no
place
for
poor
girls
i
suppose
it
some
woman
notion
of
yours
pursued
the
old
gentleman
turning
to
prescott
my
plans
for
my
daughters
can
concern
you
so
little
uncle
thomas
began
prescott
throwing
her
usual
diplomacy
to
the
winds
that
it
behooves
me
to
mind
my
own
business
eh
prescott
finished
for
her
with
perfect
you
are
quite
right
madam
he
seemed
really
pleased
at
prescott
spirit
and
went
on
you
do
right
to
tell
me
so
i
have
acted
in
a
most
unkinsmanly
way
toward
my
nieces
and
consequently
it
none
of
my
business
what
they
do
or
what
they
do
do
well
if
you
had
allowed
me
to
interfere
in
this
matter
i
should
have
imagined
that
you
were
doing
so
simply
because
you
wanted
to
get
into
my
good
graces
and
so
forth
which
would
have
been
quite
useless
in
as
far
as
it
would
have
changed
my
plans
in
regard
to
them
it
a
very
silly
thing
you
are
doing
with
them
in
my
opinion
but
i
glad
you
have
spirit
enough
to
stick
to
your
own
mind
now
my
dear
do
be
angry
with
me
understand
that
i
have
come
to
interfere
in
your
plans
in
no
way
at
all
it
not
my
purpose
to
use
your
poverty
and
your
need
for
my
money
as
a
force
by
which
to
tyrannize
over
you
i
had
these
thoughts
in
mind
when
i
came
here
on
an
old
man
whimsical
impulse
i
wished
first
of
all
to
put
a
period
to
the
unfriendliness
that
has
existed
between
us
all
these
years
i
wished
to
see
my
nieces
and
i
wished
at
the
same
time
and
in
order
to
avoid
any
false
attitude
on
your
part
or
on
my
own
to
have
it
clearly
understood
that
you
must
not
expect
any
financial
assistance
from
me
live
out
your
own
lives
think
out
your
own
problems
make
your
mistakes
fearlessly
do
not
i
beg
you
humiliate
yourselves
by
trying
to
conciliate
an
old
man
who
chooses
to
do
what
he
will
with
the
money
he
made
with
his
own
wits
and
labor
there
that
is
particularly
what
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
do
try
to
me
do
expect
anything
from
me
thus
if
we
are
friends
it
will
be
a
disinterested
friendship
otherwise
if
i
felt
that
we
were
on
good
terms
i
should
be
thinking
to
myself
is
only
because
i
am
the
rich
uncle
if
you
were
amiable
with
me
i
think
because
they
are
afraid
of
angering
me
now
let
us
be
friends
i
think
i
can
be
very
fond
of
my
nieces
but
do
expect
anything
from
me
is
that
clear
will
you
make
friends
with
an
old
man
on
those
terms
he
looked
first
into
prescott
eyes
and
saw
that
she
was
still
hostile
at
alma
and
read
her
bewilderment
in
her
face
and
then
at
nancy
again
his
eyes
softened
almost
touchingly
and
with
quick
instinct
she
understood
the
appeal
that
lay
beneath
his
brusque
language
she
remembered
her
father
stories
of
his
tenderness
and
somehow
she
understood
that
what
the
old
man
longed
for
was
the
simple
affection
of
which
for
so
long
his
life
had
been
empty
and
she
understood
too
his
dread
of
gaining
that
affection
by
holding
out
hopes
of
payment
for
it
his
reiterated
do
expect
anything
of
me
was
more
of
a
plea
than
a
curt
warning
he
wanted
their
for
himself
and
not
for
his
money
that
was
what
he
was
trying
to
say
in
his
brusque
almost
crude
way
her
eyes
were
bright
with
this
understanding
of
his
heart
and
she
held
out
her
hand
with
a
smile
for
he
seemed
to
have
turned
directly
to
her
for
his
answer
he
grasped
her
hand
eagerly
there
he
exclaimed
with
an
almost
pleasure
there
is
george
daughter
every
inch
we
understand
each
other
eh
good
girl
we
shall
be
friends
eh
i
a
friend
not
a
rich
old
uncle
who
give
you
what
you
want
if
you
manage
him
right
that
it
you
understand
now
this
is
pleasant
this
is
honest
be
independent
my
dear
do
expect
anything
of
me
i
tell
you
if
i
thought
that
it
was
only
thoughts
of
my
money
that
bought
your
i
give
the
last
cent
of
it
away
he
got
up
evidently
well
satisfied
and
still
retaining
nancy
hand
in
his
the
other
he
held
out
to
prescott
who
took
it
with
a
constrained
smile
and
then
in
high
he
pinched
dimpled
chin
playfully
i
glad
i
came
we
know
each
other
better
after
a
while
we
understand
each
other
eh
the
hatchet
is
buried
eh
good
it
a
piece
of
business
i
been
putting
off
for
a
long
while
where
my
umbrella
the
three
prescotts
stood
at
the
window
staring
with
varying
feelings
at
the
stooped
but
surprisingly
agile
old
figure
that
walked
off
through
the
rain
and
fog
head
down
the
worn
velvet
collar
of
his
old
coat
hunched
around
his
neck
and
with
never
a
look
behind
then
all
at
once
both
alma
and
nancy
broke
out
laughing
you
seemed
to
get
along
with
him
beautifully
chuckled
alma
goodness
he
scared
me
out
of
my
five
wits
so
that
i
understand
a
word
he
was
saying
i
could
tell
you
for
the
life
of
me
what
he
was
talking
about
i
think
he
must
be
crazy
but
he
does
seem
so
bad
at
all
at
times
he
even
looked
rather
nice
why
i
believe
he
nice
said
nancy
he
a
funny
eccentric
old
man
but
i
sure
that
he
be
rather
a
dear
if
he
does
think
that
we
are
trying
to
him
as
he
says
prescott
was
silent
her
pretty
face
frowning
a
little
nancy
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
then
putting
her
arms
around
her
rubbed
her
own
ruddy
cheek
against
her
mother
pink
one
put
yourself
in
his
place
mother
she
said
gently
he
very
lonely
he
wants
to
be
friendly
he
was
thinking
of
father
all
the
time
you
know
but
he
has
a
horror
of
our
being
affectionate
with
him
just
for
the
sake
of
his
money
imagine
what
it
would
be
to
be
a
lonely
old
man
always
troubled
by
the
thought
that
the
only
reason
people
would
be
nice
to
him
was
because
they
were
hoping
to
profit
by
it
he
made
it
very
clear
that
he
has
no
intention
of
of
helping
us
in
that
way
said
prescott
and
i
glad
of
it
i
glad
of
it
cried
nancy
i
do
want
to
act
and
think
and
live
to
conciliate
a
rich
relative
i
think
that
must
be
the
most
hateful
position
in
the
world
i
want
to
forget
that
uncle
thomas
is
very
rich
and
very
old
just
as
he
wants
us
to
forget
it
i
want
to
make
my
own
life
and
have
no
one
to
thank
or
to
blame
for
whatever
i
accomplish
but
myself
what
an
independent
lassie
you
are
right
dear
said
prescott
touching
the
little
curls
around
nancy
flushed
face
affectionately
you
are
right
you
are
like
a
boy
are
you
i
was
never
that
way
myself
and
that
was
the
trouble
you
have
such
good
sense
my
dear
whatever
am
i
going
to
do
without
you
chapter
viii
the
first
night
at
school
miss
leland
school
wore
that
sober
title
with
a
somewhat
frivolous
air
it
seemed
to
be
saying
oh
call
me
a
school
if
you
want
to
but
do
take
me
seriously
it
was
like
a
pretty
girl
who
puts
on
a
pair
of
spectacles
in
fun
and
assumes
a
studious
expression
while
the
dimples
lurk
in
her
cheeks
it
was
a
low
rambling
white
building
with
a
stately
colonial
portico
and
broad
porches
at
each
wing
in
front
an
immaculate
lawn
swept
to
the
trim
hedges
that
bordered
the
road
in
the
back
this
lawn
sloped
downward
to
a
grove
of
trees
which
were
now
almost
bare
under
them
stood
several
picturesque
stone
benches
while
just
beyond
lay
a
wide
with
a
in
the
centre
altogether
it
resembled
a
pleasant
country
place
dedicated
to
merriment
and
good
cheer
through
the
dusk
of
a
rather
bleak
autumn
night
its
friendly
lights
shone
out
comfortably
as
the
two
prescotts
jogged
up
to
the
door
in
the
station
wagon
the
trip
up
from
the
broadmore
station
had
not
however
been
a
lively
one
despite
the
fact
that
two
other
girls
besides
the
prescotts
had
taken
the
hack
with
them
the
first
spasm
of
homesickness
having
evidently
seized
them
all
simultaneously
one
of
the
girls
a
little
creature
sat
like
a
mouse
in
her
corner
and
by
occasional
dismal
sniffles
gave
notice
that
she
was
weeping
and
did
not
want
to
be
disturbed
the
other
a
plump
miss
with
scarlet
cheeks
and
perfectly
round
eyes
had
bravely
essayed
a
conversation
are
you
going
to
miss
leland
yes
is
this
your
first
year
yes
what
your
names
the
prescotts
gave
her
the
information
and
she
told
them
in
exchange
that
her
name
was
maizie
forrest
that
she
was
from
pittsburgh
that
she
had
a
brother
at
yale
and
another
at
pomfret
and
that
she
thought
it
no
end
of
fun
that
they
the
prescotts
were
going
to
miss
leland
after
this
flow
of
confidence
conversation
languished
and
expired
in
the
silence
of
dismal
thoughts
the
hack
drove
up
to
the
door
and
deposited
the
four
girls
on
the
steps
then
they
entered
the
hall
from
which
was
issuing
a
perfect
babel
of
feminine
squeaks
and
chattering
as
nancy
and
alma
stood
together
frankly
clinging
hand
to
hand
a
husky
damsel
rushed
past
them
and
precipitated
herself
on
the
neck
and
shoulders
of
the
conversational
maizie
maizie
darling
jane
dearest
when
did
you
get
here
been
here
hours
my
dear
we
going
to
room
together
is
that
scrumptious
perfectly
divine
where
alice
has
come
yet
come
on
let
go
see
the
small
weepy
girl
stood
still
gazing
mournfully
at
the
rapturous
meetings
about
her
nancy
looked
at
her
sympathetically
but
she
felt
much
too
blue
and
strange
herself
to
try
to
urge
anyone
else
to
be
cheerful
i
do
know
where
we
go
or
what
we
supposed
to
do
do
you
she
whispered
to
alma
no
i
hope
to
goodness
it
near
supper
time
there
i
think
miss
leland
a
tall
very
thin
very
erect
lady
wearing
attached
to
a
long
gold
chain
and
with
sparkling
fluffy
white
hair
that
made
her
face
look
quite
brown
in
contrast
was
descending
the
stairs
several
of
the
girls
rushed
to
her
and
she
kissed
them
peckishly
evidently
they
were
old
pupils
nancy
and
alma
heard
her
asking
them
about
their
dear
mothers
and
their
charming
fathers
and
where
they
had
been
during
the
summer
and
if
playfully
they
were
going
to
work
very
very
hard
and
the
girls
were
saying
miss
leland
it
so
to
be
back
again
nancy
and
alma
approached
her
a
little
uncertainly
the
other
girls
drew
back
and
frankly
stared
at
them
new
girls
they
heard
whispered
and
for
some
reason
the
appellation
made
them
both
feel
terribly
out
of
it
miss
leland
began
nancy
coloring
i
i
anne
prescott
i
this
is
my
sister
alma
i
er
why
yes
i
so
glad
you
got
here
safely
said
miss
leland
quite
cordially
taking
nancy
hand
and
alma
at
the
same
time
of
course
you
want
to
know
where
your
room
is
you
two
are
going
to
room
together
anyway
later
you
will
probably
have
different
roommates
now
let
me
see
mildred
this
is
anne
prescott
and
this
is
alma
they
are
new
girls
so
i
going
to
count
on
you
to
help
them
find
themselves
a
little
they
are
going
to
be
next
door
to
you
so
will
you
take
them
a
very
handsome
very
girl
with
gray
eyes
and
a
roman
nose
shook
hands
with
them
briefly
the
sisters
followed
her
in
a
subdued
silence
she
was
the
sort
of
girl
plainly
destined
to
become
one
of
the
most
frigid
and
formidable
of
dowagers
it
was
impossible
to
look
at
her
profile
her
fur
coat
or
to
meet
her
cold
critical
glance
without
immediately
picturing
her
with
a
lorgnon
crisply
marcelled
gray
hair
and
the
wintry
smile
with
which
the
typical
unapproachable
matron
can
freeze
out
the
slightest
attempt
at
an
unwelcome
friendliness
on
the
part
of
an
inconsequential
person
her
last
name
was
weighty
with
importance
since
she
was
the
daughter
of
marshall
lloyd
the
railroad
magnate
i
sha
like
nancy
remarked
to
alma
when
this
young
lady
had
indicated
their
room
to
them
and
left
them
with
a
curt
announcement
that
they
should
go
in
fifteen
minutes
she
is
sort
of
agreed
alma
throwing
her
hat
on
her
narrow
white
bed
but
there
no
sense
in
being
prejudiced
against
a
person
right
away
goodness
this
room
is
chilly
i
wish
we
knew
somebody
here
i
hate
being
a
new
girl
everyone
else
sounds
as
if
they
are
having
such
a
good
time
i
feel
dreadfully
out
of
it
you
and
all
the
girls
look
at
you
as
if
they
were
wondering
who
in
the
world
you
are
well
it
only
natural
that
we
feel
that
way
now
said
nancy
trying
to
sound
cheerful
come
on
we
got
to
hurry
from
the
line
of
rooms
along
the
corridor
issued
the
unceasing
chatter
of
gay
voices
there
was
a
continual
scampering
back
and
forth
bursts
of
tumultuous
greetings
giggles
shrieks
alma
comb
in
hand
stood
at
the
doorway
listening
with
a
wistful
droop
to
her
lips
two
doors
down
four
girls
were
perched
up
on
a
trunk
kicking
it
with
their
heels
and
gabbling
like
magpies
in
the
room
opposite
five
girls
curled
up
on
the
two
beds
were
gossiping
blithely
while
a
sixth
a
pretty
girl
was
gaily
unpacking
her
trunk
flinging
her
lingerie
with
great
skill
across
the
room
into
the
open
drawers
of
the
bureau
which
caught
stockings
and
petticoats
very
much
as
a
dog
will
catch
a
bone
in
his
mouth
they
were
all
having
such
a
good
time
and
they
all
seemed
to
have
a
lengthy
history
of
gay
summer
doings
to
relate
each
one
jabbered
away
apparently
perfectly
regardless
of
what
the
others
were
saying
oh
my
dear
i
have
the
most
marvellous
time
dick
told
me
are
you
going
to
come
out
next
winter
margie
wedding
was
perfectly
gorgeous
and
caught
the
bouquet
tom
is
coming
down
for
the
midwinter
dance
who
that
frump
who
rooming
with
sara
dozens
of
new
girls
hope
some
of
are
human
anyway
come
on
alma
hurry
you
have
even
washed
yet
said
nancy
impatiently
we
got
to
go
yes
and
stand
around
gaping
like
ninnies
added
alma
morosely
coming
back
to
the
mirror
and
beginning
to
brush
out
her
thick
yellow
hair
it
be
ever
so
much
nicer
when
we
come
back
here
after
the
christmas
holidays
said
nancy
busily
polishing
her
nails
to
hide
the
mist
that
would
creep
over
her
eyes
we
can
fix
up
this
room
a
bit
if
we
can
put
up
some
chintz
curtains
and
get
a
few
books
and
cushions
around
it
be
as
good
as
home
almost
but
but
mother
wo
be
here
and
neither
will
hannah
and
here
alma
quite
suddenly
burst
out
crying
wrinkling
up
her
pretty
face
like
a
child
of
two
with
the
tears
dripping
off
her
chin
she
continued
to
brush
her
hair
vigorously
sobbing
and
sniffling
pathetically
nancy
looked
up
and
unable
any
longer
to
control
her
own
tears
while
at
the
same
time
she
was
almost
hysterically
amused
by
alma
ridiculously
droll
expression
of
grief
began
to
sob
and
giggle
alternately
alma
still
clutching
the
brush
promptly
threw
herself
into
nancy
arms
and
there
they
sat
clinging
together
and
frankly
wailing
like
a
pair
of
lost
children
in
full
view
of
the
corridor
i
i
want
to
sniffled
alma
i
i
do
like
that
girl
with
wailed
nancy
your
hair
alma
you
for
be
expelled
here
she
tried
to
twist
up
alma
unruly
mane
hardly
realizing
what
she
trying
to
do
while
alma
tenderly
mopped
nancy
wet
cheeks
with
her
own
little
soaking
handkerchief
i
i
say
you
two
are
are
you
inquired
a
drawling
utterly
amazed
voice
from
the
doorway
the
two
girls
looked
up
their
hostile
expressions
plainly
asking
whose
business
it
was
if
they
howling
but
promptly
their
hostility
vanished
a
very
tall
astonishingly
lank
girl
was
standing
in
the
doorway
feet
apart
and
hands
clasped
behind
her
back
regarding
them
amiably
through
a
pair
of
enormous
goggles
every
now
and
again
she
would
blink
her
eyes
and
screw
up
her
face
comically
while
she
continued
to
smile
showing
a
set
of
teeth
as
large
and
white
as
pebbles
you
were
saying
something
about
being
expelled
are
you
expelled
already
plus
pello
pellere
pulsi
meaning
to
push
out
or
as
we
say
in
the
vernacular
to
kick
out
fire
bounce
miss
drinkwater
likes
us
to
note
the
latin
derivations
of
all
our
english
words
and
i
got
the
habit
you
two
seem
to
be
lachrymosus
or
blue
by
which
i
take
it
that
you
are
new
girls
i
sympathize
with
you
although
i
am
an
ancient
two
years
ago
this
very
night
i
wept
so
hard
that
i
nearly
gave
my
roommate
pneumonia
from
the
dampness
with
this
unconventional
preliminary
accompanied
by
one
of
the
friendliest
and
most
disarming
grins
imaginable
the
newcomer
marched
over
to
the
bed
and
shook
hands
vigorously
my
name
is
charlotte
lucretia
adela
spencer
really
it
is
you
must
take
my
word
for
it
but
i
only
use
the
the
others
i
keep
in
case
of
emergency
i
room
next
door
with
mildred
lloyd
who
incidentally
is
a
perfect
lady
while
am
not
i
was
born
in
the
year
in
the
city
of
denver
colorado
but
of
that
more
anon
it
tremendously
interesting
but
if
is
your
name
alma
if
you
do
get
your
coiffure
coifed
you
miss
out
on
our
evening
repast
wiggle
my
dear
wiggle
thus
urged
alma
wiggled
accordingly
and
while
she
carefully
washed
her
face
and
put
up
her
hair
their
visitor
sprawling
across
the
bed
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
ridiculous
remarks
all
uttered
in
her
peculiar
dry
drawling
voice
and
punctuated
with
the
oddest
facial
contortions
yet
in
spite
of
her
nonsense
there
was
very
evidently
a
good
deal
of
real
sense
and
the
kindest
feeling
behind
it
and
her
singular
face
too
unusual
to
be
called
either
plain
or
pretty
beamed
with
satisfaction
when
she
had
won
a
genuine
peal
of
laughter
from
the
two
dejected
prescotts
we
better
go
down
now
of
course
everything
is
more
or
less
my
trunk
i
think
must
be
still
out
in
kokomo
indiana
or
some
such
place
i
do
even
expect
to
see
it
for
another
month
or
so
but
do
mind
i
a
regular
child
of
nature
anyway
it
just
amelia
who
pernickety
about
our
appearing
in
full
regalia
every
night
for
dinner
amelia
is
leland
of
course
tremendously
keen
on
preserving
a
refining
influence
about
the
school
and
i
think
she
looks
on
me
as
a
rather
demoralizing
factor
there
goes
the
gong
the
three
went
together
charlotte
linking
herself
between
nancy
and
alma
as
if
by
magic
the
din
of
a
few
moments
before
had
been
lulled
the
fifty
or
sixty
girls
had
gathered
in
the
large
reception
room
where
a
was
blazing
up
a
huge
stone
chimney
and
where
miss
leland
wearing
a
dignified
black
evening
dress
was
seated
in
a
pontifical
chair
chatting
with
eight
or
ten
of
her
charges
with
the
air
of
a
gracious
hostess
all
the
voices
had
sunk
to
a
lower
key
is
everyone
here
she
looked
about
her
and
closing
the
book
she
had
been
toying
with
led
the
way
into
the
beyond
where
the
ten
or
twelve
small
tables
with
their
snowy
covers
and
softly
shaded
candles
gave
the
room
more
the
appearance
of
a
quiet
restaurant
than
the
ordinary
school
refectory
charlotte
spencer
sat
with
nancy
at
a
table
near
miss
leland
while
alma
found
herself
separated
from
her
sister
and
relegated
to
another
table
where
she
was
completely
marooned
among
five
strange
girls
charlotte
introduced
nancy
to
a
sallow
maiden
with
prominent
front
teeth
named
allison
maitland
to
a
statuesque
brunette
named
katherine
leonard
the
school
beauty
was
her
brief
comment
and
this
is
denise
lloyd
sister
of
mildred
my
roommate
hope
we
have
soup
are
you
any
relation
to
lawrence
prescott
who
goes
to
williams
asked
the
beautiful
katherine
turning
to
nancy
with
a
slightly
patronizing
air
nancy
vaguely
disclaimed
a
kinship
that
might
have
won
her
miss
leonard
interest
and
thereby
quickly
lost
some
of
it
no
she
not
she
says
said
charlotte
is
he
a
beau
of
yours
replied
the
girl
a
soft
blush
mantling
her
damask
cheek
he
a
beau
of
mine
who
is
and
with
this
keen
retort
she
again
lost
herself
in
her
maiden
meditations
but
i
tell
you
who
she
is
a
relation
of
she
the
cousin
once
removed
of
conquest
of
peru
are
you
nancy
charlotte
you
a
scream
said
katherine
with
an
affected
laugh
and
turning
to
nancy
she
went
on
speaking
in
a
mincing
voice
and
always
placing
her
lips
as
if
she
were
continually
guarding
against
spoiling
the
symmetry
of
their
perfect
cupid
bow
you
know
we
always
expect
charlotte
to
say
funny
things
i
the
school
buffoon
in
other
words
commented
charlotte
dryly
evidently
not
much
liking
to
be
marked
as
a
professional
humorist
i
supposed
to
be
amusin
doncherknow
and
consequently
everyone
is
expected
to
whenever
i
open
my
mouth
but
if
you
listen
carefully
you
be
surprised
to
hear
that
at
times
i
talk
sense
now
allison
here
is
the
school
genius
you
never
suspect
it
but
she
is
i
wish
to
goodness
that
new
waitress
would
bring
me
some
more
bread
it
is
considered
stylish
around
here
to
have
the
bread
on
the
table
but
i
do
wish
they
consider
my
appetite
is
that
perfectly
girl
over
there
your
sister
asked
katherine
indicating
alma
her
slightly
patronizing
air
still
more
pronounced
your
new
rival
for
the
golden
apple
kate
remarked
charlotte
with
a
grin
and
a
blonde
too
katherine
flushed
and
tried
to
laugh
off
her
annoyance
at
impish
teasing
i
think
she
perfectly
lovely
oh
handsome
is
as
handsome
does
so
they
say
the
question
is
has
she
a
beautiful
soul
now
my
soul
is
something
wonderful
if
it
would
only
show
through
a
bit
murmured
charlotte
i
plain
but
good
as
they
say
of
calico
there
a
rumor
to
the
effect
that
cleopatra
was
very
ugly
hope
it
so
there
are
two
alternatives
for
an
ugly
woman
either
to
be
tremendously
good
and
noble
or
to
be
very
very
wicked
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
which
career
to
choose
it
an
awful
problem
i
going
to
take
muthick
lethons
thith
year
tharlotte
with
mithter
conthtantini
lisped
denise
lloyd
do
you
think
jutht
wonderful
denise
did
not
resemble
her
sister
in
the
least
she
was
a
plump
girl
of
sixteen
still
at
the
giggly
gushing
stage
of
her
life
but
much
more
likable
than
the
haughty
mildred
she
turned
to
nancy
with
the
polite
desire
of
including
the
new
girl
in
the
conversation
and
went
on
with
a
blush
mithter
conthtantini
is
jutht
are
you
going
to
take
muthick
lethons
you
jutht
him
and
bethides
if
you
take
muthick
you
can
drop
thience
i
do
think
i
could
get
very
far
with
the
piano
in
one
year
said
nancy
with
a
smile
oh
he
doeth
teach
piano
he
teacheth
violin
and
of
course
the
violin
is
so
much
simpler
remarked
charlotte
constantini
has
a
rolling
black
eye
and
an
artistic
temperament
inclined
to
have
fits
think
fitth
tharlotte
cried
denise
in
bitter
reproach
why
jutht
he
doeth
have
fitth
at
well
it
sounds
as
if
were
having
fits
to
hear
all
the
awful
squeaks
and
groans
that
come
out
of
the
music
room
while
one
of
our
rising
paganinis
is
having
her
lesson
i
always
imagined
that
it
was
poor
constantini
replied
charlotte
mildly
anyway
the
point
is
that
constantini
is
a
beautiful
creature
and
consequently
a
year
of
violin
is
considered
infinitely
more
improving
than
a
year
of
science
personally
i
think
that
the
study
of
the
violin
ought
to
be
forbidden
under
penalty
of
the
law
except
in
cases
of
the
most
acute
genius
i
think
that
the
playing
of
one
wrong
note
on
the
violin
ought
to
be
punishable
by
a
heavy
fine
and
playing
two
by
imprisonment
for
life
or
longer
there
are
times
when
i
feel
that
hanging
is
far
too
good
for
dolly
parker
she
ought
to
be
boiled
in
oil
until
tender
nancy
laughed
so
you
take
the
year
of
science
that
where
i
belong
too
i
suppose
tharlotte
plays
the
piano
jutht
beautifully
said
denise
she
compotheth
my
brother
calls
it
decomposition
said
charlotte
reddening
as
she
always
did
when
any
of
her
talents
were
lauded
and
trying
to
turn
it
off
with
a
joke
miss
leland
rose
and
the
room
became
silent
since
she
appeared
to
be
about
to
make
an
announcement
girls
there
is
of
course
no
and
special
privileges
are
extended
to
you
all
she
said
in
her
clear
voice
you
have
an
hour
for
recreation
after
dinner
and
i
hope
that
all
the
old
girls
will
make
a
point
of
helping
our
new
girls
to
forget
that
they
are
not
at
home
prayers
will
be
at
nine
as
usual
and
you
will
not
be
required
to
be
in
your
rooms
before
no
doubt
you
all
have
a
great
deal
to
talk
about
so
i
am
going
to
be
lenient
with
you
the
regular
school
regime
will
be
resumed
hooray
nancy
you
and
alma
are
herewith
cordially
invited
to
my
room
to
a
negligee
party
at
sharp
i
had
the
good
sense
to
bring
a
few
delicacies
with
me
leaving
my
trunk
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
express
company
charlotte
rose
and
taking
nancy
arm
filed
out
of
the
with
the
other
girls
behind
miss
leland
but
in
the
a
small
band
of
girls
fell
upon
charlotte
come
along
old
dear
some
now
come
on
and
they
bore
her
off
to
the
piano
deposited
her
almost
bodily
upon
the
bench
and
opened
the
keyboard
three
others
rolled
back
the
rugs
from
the
polished
floor
and
in
a
moment
a
dozen
couples
were
spinning
around
as
gaily
as
if
they
were
at
a
ball
nancy
a
prey
to
her
usual
shyness
in
the
midst
of
strangers
clung
close
to
the
piano
where
charlotte
without
pausing
in
her
astonishingly
clever
playing
reached
up
and
drew
her
down
on
the
piano
bench
from
where
she
could
watch
alma
alma
prettiness
and
natural
gaiety
was
having
its
usual
success
the
younger
girls
crowded
around
her
the
older
girls
petted
her
even
the
frigid
mildred
made
her
dance
with
her
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
eyes
bright
again
by
some
indescribable
charm
she
had
walked
into
instant
popularity
without
a
shadow
of
envy
nancy
watched
her
proudly
alma
was
easily
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
school
everyone
must
like
her
everything
must
go
smoothly
and
gaily
for
her
there
were
people
like
that
in
the
world
people
who
did
have
to
be
wise
or
prudent
some
kindly
providence
seemed
always
to
protect
them
from
the
consequences
of
their
lack
of
common
sense
just
as
kindly
nature
protects
the
butterflies
the
dancers
stopped
one
by
one
some
gathered
in
groups
about
the
fire
others
clustered
in
the
one
or
two
practical
souls
had
gone
to
their
rooms
to
put
away
some
of
their
things
charlotte
nimble
fingers
began
to
wander
idly
among
the
keys
nancy
watched
her
curiously
listening
in
some
surprise
to
the
change
in
the
music
she
felt
an
instinctive
fondness
for
this
big
whimsical
friendly
girl
and
knew
very
well
that
underneath
her
nonsense
lay
a
streak
of
some
fine
quality
that
would
make
an
unshakeable
foundation
for
a
genuine
friendship
she
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
charlotte
by
herself
but
charlotte
was
already
talking
in
her
own
way
she
seemed
to
have
quite
forgotten
nancy
and
everyone
else
in
the
room
and
with
her
head
bent
over
the
keys
she
was
playing
for
herself
little
by
little
the
other
girls
stopped
talking
she
did
not
notice
that
at
all
nancy
listened
to
her
playing
in
astonishment
it
was
far
beyond
anything
like
ordinary
schoolgirl
facility
it
was
full
of
genuine
talent
and
poetry
now
smooth
and
lyrical
and
again
as
capricious
and
impish
as
some
of
her
own
moods
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
nancy
with
an
smile
like
music
nancy
nodded
i
believe
you
really
do
you
are
just
saying
so
are
you
well
i
like
you
ever
so
much
listen
do
get
the
idea
that
everything
i
say
is
meant
to
be
funny
sometimes
i
very
serious
you
believe
it
would
you
chapter
ix
a
quarrel
you
had
your
choice
at
miss
leland
between
studying
and
doing
what
the
large
majority
of
the
girls
did
namely
making
friends
reading
novels
during
your
study
periods
and
leaving
it
to
providence
to
decide
whether
you
passed
your
examinations
or
not
the
teachers
were
lenient
souls
with
the
exception
of
miss
drinkwater
the
latin
teacher
who
was
unreasonably
irritable
when
her
pupils
came
to
class
armed
with
the
seraphic
smiles
of
ignorance
and
a
number
of
convincing
excuses
which
invariably
failed
to
convince
miss
drinkwater
in
consequence
very
few
of
the
girls
pursued
their
studies
in
that
classic
tongue
longer
than
the
first
month
what
point
was
there
in
doing
so
they
argued
coolly
none
of
them
had
any
aspirations
toward
college
and
nearly
all
of
them
harbored
a
dread
of
learning
anything
that
might
show
on
the
surface
and
thereby
discourage
the
attentions
of
the
college
youths
which
were
of
infinitely
more
importance
in
their
eyes
as
indeed
in
the
eyes
of
their
fond
mothers
likewise
than
the
attainment
of
the
scholarly
graces
miss
leland
was
one
of
those
schools
instituted
primarily
to
meet
the
necessity
of
our
young
plutocrats
for
mingling
with
their
own
peculiar
kind
forming
advantageous
connections
it
is
called
the
question
of
education
was
secondary
if
not
quite
negligible
the
daughters
of
steel
magnates
came
from
pittsburgh
to
meet
the
daughters
of
railroad
magnates
from
new
york
and
incidentally
to
meet
one
brothers
at
the
small
social
functions
which
miss
leland
gave
ostensibly
for
the
purpose
of
developing
in
her
charges
an
easy
poise
and
the
most
correct
manners
the
girls
for
the
most
part
regarded
lessons
as
a
wholly
unnecessary
adjunct
to
their
school
duties
and
treated
them
as
such
and
this
was
all
very
well
indeed
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
from
school
they
would
plunge
into
the
whirl
of
their
débutante
season
and
from
that
into
marriage
it
was
all
clearly
mapped
out
for
them
and
the
shadow
of
any
serious
doubt
as
to
the
course
of
their
careers
never
fell
across
their
serenely
trustful
indolence
there
is
something
peculiarly
vitiating
in
such
an
atmosphere
pleasure
was
regarded
not
merely
as
an
embroidery
on
the
sober
fustian
of
life
but
as
the
very
warp
and
woof
of
it
where
the
most
sober
consideration
was
that
of
winning
popularity
and
the
opportunity
of
social
advantages
where
the
clothes
to
be
bought
and
the
parties
to
be
given
during
the
holidays
were
already
the
subject
of
endless
absorbing
discussions
the
effect
of
all
this
on
each
of
the
prescotts
was
diametrically
opposed
alma
had
adapted
herself
to
it
as
easily
as
to
a
new
cloak
not
having
any
stubborn
notions
of
her
own
she
was
as
malleable
to
such
an
environment
as
a
piece
of
modelling
clay
in
warm
water
pretty
easily
led
she
swam
into
a
rather
meaningless
popularity
inside
of
four
days
this
nancy
was
glad
of
but
her
satisfaction
was
not
unmixed
she
saw
alma
gradually
undergoing
a
change
that
threatened
to
damage
her
own
steadying
influence
over
her
sister
and
to
divide
their
sympathies
alma
was
only
too
ready
and
too
well
suited
temperamentally
to
lose
sight
of
the
difference
between
her
own
circumstances
and
those
of
the
girls
with
whom
she
was
now
associated
indeed
the
very
fact
that
she
could
do
so
while
nancy
could
not
lay
at
the
root
of
the
problem
that
had
begun
to
worry
nancy
aside
from
minor
changes
in
alma
such
as
for
instance
a
new
little
affectedness
of
manner
unconsciously
borrowed
from
mildred
lloyd
and
her
use
of
mildred
particular
slang
phrases
nancy
had
noticed
in
her
sister
at
times
a
tinge
of
impatience
and
a
little
air
of
superiority
with
which
alma
unwillingly
listened
to
her
when
she
tried
to
talk
to
her
seriously
nancy
began
to
feel
unhappily
that
alma
was
coming
to
resent
her
efforts
to
guide
her
and
advise
her
in
regard
to
various
small
matters
and
worst
of
all
that
alma
was
privately
beginning
to
look
upon
her
as
rather
unnecessarily
serious
and
even
it
was
impossible
for
nancy
to
lose
the
feeling
that
she
had
that
her
mother
had
made
a
mistake
in
sending
them
to
miss
leland
which
gave
them
little
or
nothing
that
they
could
use
and
was
very
likely
to
affect
even
her
own
steady
vision
of
their
circumstances
and
opportunities
she
was
continually
trying
to
counteract
the
consequences
of
this
mistake
but
alma
was
less
than
willing
to
take
her
point
of
view
nancy
still
clung
to
her
plan
of
getting
herself
ready
for
college
never
for
a
moment
could
she
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
in
all
probability
she
would
have
to
make
her
own
living
which
alma
like
her
mother
was
very
ready
to
forget
counting
always
as
they
did
on
happy
chance
to
smooth
out
the
future
for
them
into
a
sunny
vista
it
was
not
that
nancy
was
a
pessimist
she
simply
believed
that
good
luck
was
something
more
or
less
of
one
own
making
she
was
full
of
eagerness
and
enthusiasm
for
life
as
ardent
as
an
ambitious
boy
and
restive
to
make
a
trial
of
her
own
capabilities
she
knew
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
her
uncle
providing
for
them
after
all
in
spite
of
his
own
very
clear
hints
to
the
contrary
but
on
the
other
hand
there
remained
the
fact
that
he
was
an
eccentric
old
fellow
more
than
equally
likely
to
bequeath
his
entire
fortune
to
some
freakish
project
or
obscure
charity
organization
it
was
not
a
very
easy
task
to
study
seriously
at
miss
leland
an
earnest
student
was
immediately
dubbed
vividly
enough
if
inelegantly
a
greasy
grind
and
was
left
more
or
less
to
her
own
devices
but
if
nancy
was
not
as
popular
as
alma
she
was
regarded
with
a
good
deal
of
respect
and
genuine
admiration
by
the
other
girls
and
in
charlotte
spencer
she
had
found
a
really
devoted
friend
underneath
her
apparent
charlotte
concealed
from
the
view
of
those
for
whom
she
had
no
especial
regard
a
stratum
of
rather
unusual
common
sense
mingled
with
an
idealism
and
a
youthful
ardor
which
few
would
have
suspected
in
her
nature
opinions
concerning
her
varied
widely
mildred
lloyd
considered
her
crude
for
example
most
of
the
girls
thought
her
simply
amusing
and
odd
and
hardly
knew
how
to
account
for
some
of
her
queer
serious
moods
in
one
way
or
another
without
apparently
studying
at
all
she
managed
always
to
take
the
highest
marks
in
the
school
she
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
very
rich
western
a
widower
who
found
the
problem
of
managing
this
child
of
his
more
difficult
than
any
commercial
nut
he
had
ever
had
to
crack
he
had
only
the
vaguest
notions
as
to
what
was
necessary
for
a
girl
career
and
imagined
that
by
sending
his
daughter
to
a
fashionable
eastern
school
he
was
getting
at
the
heart
of
the
solution
charlotte
wanted
to
study
music
not
like
a
miss
she
told
nancy
i
want
to
make
it
the
real
thing
i
tell
you
i
do
know
anything
about
it
but
i
going
to
yet
old
spencer
while
he
had
no
objections
to
one
of
the
arts
as
a
ladylike
accomplishment
felt
that
it
was
not
exactly
respectable
for
a
girl
to
go
into
it
seriously
just
why
he
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
say
you
know
charlotte
had
explained
with
her
humorous
smile
there
is
a
notion
that
it
all
right
for
a
to
dabble
in
anything
painting
music
or
embroidery
and
so
on
so
long
as
she
does
attempt
to
make
a
profession
of
it
or
think
of
making
money
by
it
of
course
this
idea
is
changing
now
a
bit
but
people
like
mildred
lloyd
for
instance
and
all
her
kind
still
think
not
perfectly
as
she
puts
it
it
was
not
in
the
least
that
spencer
had
even
a
grain
of
snobbishness
in
his
rough
vigorous
makeup
so
far
as
either
himself
or
his
three
sons
were
concerned
his
very
love
for
his
charlie
as
he
called
her
made
him
stubborn
in
his
ideas
concerning
what
was
best
for
her
he
wanted
her
to
have
everything
that
he
could
give
her
and
he
gave
her
what
he
imagined
her
mother
would
have
wanted
him
to
give
it
was
because
charlotte
understood
that
his
stubbornness
grew
out
of
his
adoration
of
her
that
she
gave
in
to
his
wishes
in
good
time
i
do
what
i
want
of
course
she
said
with
serene
but
the
least
i
can
do
for
darling
old
dad
is
to
make
him
believe
that
all
the
time
i
doing
what
wants
he
such
a
lamb
you
know
the
warm
friendship
that
grew
up
between
the
two
girls
had
a
strong
bond
in
the
similarity
of
their
position
at
miss
leland
and
in
the
circumstances
of
their
being
there
as
well
as
in
their
mutual
sympathy
with
each
other
ideas
it
was
a
saturday
afternoon
late
in
october
when
the
days
were
rapidly
shortening
into
wintry
dusks
and
there
was
even
the
hint
of
an
early
snow
in
the
skies
against
which
the
bare
stiff
branches
of
the
trees
shivered
in
a
nipping
wind
nancy
all
ruddy
and
breezy
from
a
brisk
walk
with
charlotte
had
come
up
to
her
room
to
finish
an
english
paper
across
the
hall
a
group
of
girls
had
gathered
around
katherine
leonard
chafing
dish
from
which
the
tantalizing
smell
of
thick
hot
fudge
was
beginning
to
pervade
the
corridors
and
distract
the
thoughts
of
the
more
studious
from
their
unsocial
but
conscientious
labors
come
on
in
nance
called
alma
waving
a
sticky
spoon
invitingly
surely
you
are
going
to
work
now
are
you
nancy
hesitated
her
hand
on
the
they
all
looked
so
jolly
the
room
so
cosy
and
the
warm
chocolaty
smell
of
the
fudge
was
almost
irresistible
nancy
nose
twitched
at
the
delicious
odor
and
she
smiled
uncertainly
i
got
to
finish
my
english
she
began
oh
bother
your
english
cried
dolly
parker
none
of
us
have
even
looked
at
ours
yet
do
be
a
come
on
you
such
a
shark
at
it
miss
garnett
would
bother
you
if
you
loafed
for
a
month
added
maizie
forrest
this
was
quite
true
and
that
was
the
trouble
it
was
just
because
miss
garnett
was
so
lenient
that
nancy
felt
the
responsibility
of
keeping
up
in
her
work
resting
heavily
on
herself
nearly
all
the
girls
loafed
shamelessly
and
nancy
had
to
guard
against
the
temptation
to
imitate
them
she
knew
that
she
would
have
to
pass
a
stiff
examination
in
english
to
enter
college
and
that
it
mattered
nothing
to
miss
garnett
whether
she
passed
or
not
well
the
point
is
that
i
got
so
little
to
do
on
it
that
i
might
as
well
finish
it
up
and
feel
free
she
said
finally
i
come
in
a
little
while
so
do
for
goodness
sake
eat
all
the
fudge
oh
nancy
you
make
me
tired
pouted
alma
if
you
going
to
be
such
an
old
poke
you
do
deserve
any
fudge
nancy
only
laughed
in
reply
and
calmly
went
in
to
her
room
and
shut
the
door
she
flung
her
sweater
on
her
bed
sent
her
scarlet
after
it
and
then
stood
for
a
moment
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
her
skirt
looking
about
her
the
prescotts
room
was
certainly
not
the
cosiest
and
most
inviting
in
the
school
and
she
had
listened
long
to
alma
petitions
for
an
easy
chair
and
a
new
lamp
to
take
the
place
of
the
student
lamp
which
by
its
hard
sharp
light
intensified
the
severe
bareness
of
the
little
place
besides
the
two
beds
there
were
the
two
desks
two
stiff
and
the
two
small
bureaus
nothing
had
been
added
to
soften
the
chilly
aspect
except
a
pair
of
cheap
chintz
curtains
at
the
window
and
a
few
small
cushions
on
the
they
had
no
pictures
or
photographs
no
rugs
no
tea
service
none
of
the
hundred
and
one
little
knickknacks
with
which
the
other
girls
managed
to
turn
their
bedrooms
into
luxurious
little
dens
consequently
they
were
never
besieged
by
bands
of
hilarious
callers
and
alma
herself
was
never
in
her
room
any
more
than
she
could
help
at
night
she
preferred
a
chat
in
mildred
room
or
in
kay
leonard
even
when
she
studied
which
occupied
indeed
little
enough
of
her
time
she
sought
a
more
congenial
atmosphere
and
nancy
except
for
company
was
a
good
deal
by
herself
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
about
it
she
could
not
go
to
the
expense
of
a
new
rug
and
an
easy
chair
and
a
new
lamp
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
alma
felt
ashamed
of
the
mute
confession
of
a
narrow
purse
expressed
by
the
chill
simplicity
of
the
room
losing
her
memory
of
their
straitened
means
amid
the
easy
affluence
of
the
other
girls
she
became
more
and
more
sulky
against
nancy
for
her
rigid
economy
she
contended
that
she
saw
no
reason
for
it
that
nancy
was
carrying
it
to
unnecessary
extremes
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
nancy
began
to
rummage
in
her
desk
for
her
english
paper
and
then
sat
down
to
it
grimly
determined
to
concentrate
on
it
and
to
drive
away
all
distracting
thoughts
she
forgot
about
the
and
an
hour
went
by
before
she
looked
up
with
a
sigh
and
carefully
glancing
over
her
finished
pages
folded
them
neatly
inside
her
copy
of
burke
speeches
all
her
work
was
finished
and
she
could
look
forward
to
sunday
with
a
comfortable
anticipation
of
unhampered
freedom
it
was
still
half
an
hour
before
the
dressing
bell
would
ring
so
she
put
on
her
kimono
and
her
sociable
mood
having
passed
tucked
herself
up
on
the
with
a
book
in
a
little
while
the
door
opened
and
alma
came
in
to
change
her
frock
nancy
glanced
up
and
saw
in
an
instant
that
alma
was
annoyed
she
felt
troubled
it
seemed
as
if
every
day
they
were
growing
farther
apart
they
no
longer
had
those
happy
chats
together
which
had
bound
them
close
by
affection
and
sympathy
alma
no
longer
sought
her
as
her
confidant
and
seemed
to
resent
her
advice
rather
than
to
seek
it
instead
the
younger
girl
had
as
it
were
transferred
her
affection
and
her
admiration
to
the
headstrong
and
annoyingly
mildred
lloyd
mildred
had
deigned
to
pronounce
alma
pretty
and
interesting
and
had
taken
her
up
as
the
phrase
is
thereby
completely
turning
poor
alma
head
so
that
she
was
gradually
merging
even
her
personality
into
a
pale
imitation
of
mildred
blasé
expressions
and
mannerisms
alma
was
not
left
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
mildred
friendship
like
her
fancy
was
extremely
variable
and
that
she
was
quite
likely
to
turn
a
cold
shoulder
to
her
new
chum
without
deigning
to
provide
any
reason
for
doing
so
but
alma
preferred
to
believe
that
in
her
case
mildred
interest
would
not
wane
just
as
she
preferred
to
forget
her
early
prejudice
of
their
first
meeting
with
mildred
an
uncomfortable
little
silence
reigned
which
nancy
pretended
to
be
unaware
of
by
giving
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
her
book
although
the
light
from
the
window
was
so
faint
that
no
human
eye
could
have
spelt
out
the
words
on
the
page
but
when
at
length
she
was
forced
by
the
lateness
of
the
hour
to
begin
dressing
it
was
impossible
to
preserve
the
wretched
silence
any
longer
or
to
speak
as
if
nothing
were
the
matter
you
you
seem
worried
alma
she
began
hesitatingly
is
there
something
on
your
mind
i
not
worried
a
bit
returned
alma
coldly
well
are
you
angry
about
something
there
was
a
silence
alma
flung
her
hair
over
her
shoulder
and
began
to
brush
the
ends
vigorously
while
nancy
watched
the
operation
with
an
intentness
that
showed
her
mind
to
be
on
other
things
presently
alma
said
in
a
grave
voice
i
know
that
it
none
of
my
business
of
course
but
i
think
nancy
that
you
are
making
a
mistake
a
mistake
repeated
nancy
in
amazement
how
how
do
you
mean
well
it
seems
to
me
that
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
it
has
been
simply
money
wasted
to
send
you
here
why
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
alma
exclaimed
nancy
her
temper
beginning
to
rise
in
spite
of
her
amusement
at
the
fluffy
gravely
judicial
air
inasmuch
as
she
studied
harder
and
more
seriously
than
any
girl
in
the
school
and
rivalled
charlotte
in
brilliant
marks
it
was
interesting
as
well
as
irritating
to
learn
that
alma
considered
her
unsuccessful
well
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
mother
purpose
in
sending
us
here
was
for
us
to
make
friends
there
is
a
girl
in
the
school
that
you
show
the
least
interest
in
except
charlotte
and
charlotte
well
alma
shrugged
her
shoulders
expressing
thereby
what
she
hesitated
to
put
into
words
instantly
nancy
flared
up
usually
the
most
even
tempered
and
controlled
of
girls
she
could
not
keep
down
her
anger
when
it
was
roused
by
alma
periodic
fits
of
snobbishness
what
about
charlotte
why
do
you
shrug
your
shoulders
like
that
because
charlotte
is
considered
perfectly
by
mildred
because
mildred
thinks
charlotte
ordinary
a
bit
crude
she
the
girl
in
the
school
and
everyone
of
them
knows
it
too
she
the
only
one
whose
mind
is
forever
running
on
beaux
and
dances
and
other
girls
faults
she
the
only
one
of
them
who
has
brains
and
a
heart
she
the
only
real
aristocrat
of
the
whole
lot
she
the
only
one
of
them
whose
friendship
i
give
for
alma
quailed
a
little
under
nancy
indignation
she
was
indeed
a
bit
ashamed
of
her
snobbish
remark
but
she
did
not
lower
her
flag
that
no
reason
why
you
should
let
all
the
other
girls
know
it
we
need
all
the
friends
we
can
get
and
we
ca
to
lose
this
opportunity
of
making
advantageous
connections
this
last
bit
was
rather
an
unfortunate
choice
of
words
smacking
as
it
did
just
a
bit
too
strongly
of
mildred
to
soothe
nancy
irate
ear
at
just
that
moment
did
come
here
to
make
friends
simply
for
what
they
could
give
me
regardless
of
whether
i
liked
them
or
not
and
i
think
it
the
most
thing
in
the
world
to
toady
to
girls
simply
because
they
are
rich
or
fashionable
and
may
invite
you
to
parties
and
things
that
you
can
never
repay
and
it
just
that
snobbish
selfishness
that
complete
loss
of
for
the
sake
of
that
makes
so
many
poor
people
contemptible
i
rather
die
before
i
play
the
role
of
little
sister
to
the
rich
her
voice
began
to
quiver
and
she
had
a
wretched
feeling
that
she
was
very
near
tears
tears
not
of
anger
so
much
as
of
genuine
unhappiness
she
felt
as
if
every
word
she
uttered
was
doing
more
damage
and
her
heart
ached
because
she
was
quarrelling
with
alma
and
because
alma
was
changing
more
every
day
she
longed
to
throw
her
arms
around
her
sister
and
kiss
away
the
memory
of
every
word
she
had
uttered
but
stubborn
pride
as
much
a
fault
with
nancy
as
a
virtue
held
her
back
do
you
mean
that
i
toadying
asked
alma
her
eyes
growing
wide
i
know
now
what
you
think
of
me
and
i
know
that
you
simply
jealous
of
my
fondness
for
mildred
she
went
on
passionately
i
do
know
what
has
come
over
you
anyway
nancy
you
do
approve
of
a
single
thing
i
do
oh
alma
darling
how
you
say
such
things
the
tears
began
to
roll
down
nancy
cheeks
whatever
put
such
thoughts
into
your
head
when
you
how
much
i
love
you
it
not
me
but
you
who
have
changed
ca
you
see
that
i
ca
let
my
work
go
just
to
play
around
with
a
lot
of
girls
who
do
care
a
rap
for
me
myself
life
is
a
song
and
a
dance
for
alma
and
we
ca
waste
our
time
just
for
a
little
popularity
with
girls
who
forget
us
mildred
oh
go
ahead
and
say
a
lot
of
mean
things
about
mildred
interrupted
alma
bitterly
you
never
liked
her
you
took
a
prejudice
to
her
at
first
sight
you
never
even
tried
to
know
her
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
unjust
in
my
life
you
do
think
that
anyone
is
capable
of
a
real
friendship
but
you
and
charlotte
mildred
is
every
bit
as
good
a
friend
just
because
she
rich
you
think
that
she
must
be
selfish
you
the
most
girl
i
ever
knew
it
the
same
way
with
all
my
friends
you
think
frank
barrows
is
just
an
idler
a
conceited
little
what
on
earth
did
i
ever
say
against
frank
barrows
nancy
defended
herself
weakly
oh
you
never
anything
you
just
look
and
i
know
perfectly
well
what
you
think
it
seems
as
if
we
can
never
agree
about
anything
any
more
now
this
afternoon
you
might
have
been
just
a
little
bit
sociable
instead
of
that
you
shut
yourself
up
as
if
you
thought
all
those
girls
were
simply
a
lot
of
sillies
but
you
were
able
to
spend
an
hour
and
a
half
with
charlotte
i
had
to
finish
my
english
paper
and
that
all
there
was
to
it
retorted
nancy
in
any
other
school
under
the
sun
work
has
to
come
before
play
neither
one
of
us
can
afford
to
take
advantage
of
the
leniency
of
the
teachers
here
if
i
did
only
what
they
required
i
would
get
to
college
in
ten
years
and
i
got
to
get
to
college
no
matter
what
thinks
of
me
i
sorry
she
does
approve
of
my
behavior
but
it
ca
be
helped
in
her
hurt
anger
she
had
lost
her
head
a
little
bit
or
she
would
not
have
thrown
that
last
stone
at
alma
chosen
friend
for
the
time
being
at
least
it
was
impossible
to
repair
the
breach
that
the
two
wounded
indignant
girls
had
made
between
each
other
too
sick
at
heart
for
tears
too
despairingly
conscious
of
the
uselessness
of
any
attempt
at
reconciliation
nancy
began
to
dress
in
a
miserable
silence
during
dinner
nancy
made
a
pretense
at
eating
but
she
could
not
join
in
the
chatter
with
the
other
girls
once
or
twice
charlotte
glanced
at
her
but
with
her
instinctive
gentle
tact
appeared
not
to
notice
nancy
blues
at
her
table
alma
was
feverishly
gay
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
on
the
point
of
tears
never
before
had
they
had
such
a
quarrel
never
before
had
she
seen
nancy
so
heedlessly
angry
never
before
had
they
deliberately
tried
to
say
things
to
hurt
each
other
waves
of
desperate
homesickness
assailed
her
and
with
the
memory
of
happy
nights
when
they
had
gossiped
together
in
their
room
at
the
little
brown
house
a
lump
ached
in
her
throat
she
wanted
nancy
more
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
what
was
it
they
had
said
to
each
other
that
had
caused
such
a
dreadful
coldness
between
them
she
tried
to
tell
herself
that
nancy
had
misjudged
her
that
nancy
was
wrong
and
that
she
was
right
in
maintaining
her
ground
but
listening
to
the
banter
that
went
on
around
her
struggling
to
keep
up
her
own
end
of
it
bravely
she
felt
that
not
one
girl
in
the
room
nor
any
pleasure
in
the
world
was
of
the
slightest
value
to
her
so
long
as
she
did
not
have
nancy
as
her
confidant
and
dearest
friend
with
these
thoughts
battering
at
the
foolish
pride
in
their
hearts
it
would
have
taken
only
a
whispered
word
to
send
the
sisters
into
one
another
embrace
but
the
reconciliation
for
which
they
were
both
longing
so
piteously
was
postponed
by
an
incident
which
threatened
to
make
their
quarrel
even
more
serious
it
was
simply
the
outcome
of
an
unfortunate
chance
for
some
time
both
the
girls
had
known
that
miss
leland
had
planned
to
give
them
different
roommates
since
she
thought
it
a
good
idea
for
sisters
to
be
separated
so
that
they
could
make
closer
friendships
with
other
girls
after
dinner
she
spoke
of
this
again
not
to
nancy
but
to
alma
leaving
it
to
the
younger
girl
to
announce
the
change
to
nancy
she
had
of
course
no
knowledge
of
their
quarrel
nor
could
she
have
possibly
gauged
the
unfortunate
timing
of
the
change
nancy
went
up
to
her
room
directly
after
dinner
not
waiting
for
the
usual
hour
of
music
and
dancing
and
giving
as
her
excuse
the
pretense
that
she
had
some
mending
to
do
she
did
indeed
get
out
her
as
a
sort
of
defense
against
unwelcome
intrusion
but
with
a
stocking
drawn
over
her
hand
she
sat
with
her
back
to
the
door
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
sad
consolation
of
tears
in
a
little
while
the
door
opened
someone
came
in
nancy
bent
over
her
stocking
and
began
to
run
a
threadless
needle
through
a
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
she
saw
alma
busily
engaged
in
taking
some
of
her
things
out
of
the
alma
was
as
painstaking
in
keeping
her
own
face
concealed
as
nancy
though
she
tried
to
hum
a
tune
under
her
breath
the
silence
became
intolerable
but
diffidence
weighted
their
tongues
each
one
of
them
longed
to
throw
her
pride
to
the
winds
and
sue
for
a
reconciliation
but
the
fear
of
having
her
overtures
met
with
coldness
held
her
back
at
length
alma
said
in
a
voice
which
she
vainly
tried
to
make
natural
and
casual
miss
leland
has
changed
us
charlotte
spencer
is
going
to
be
your
roommate
from
now
on
and
and
i
going
in
with
with
mildred
that
a
a
good
idea
replied
nancy
sarcasm
was
a
thousand
miles
from
her
mind
and
she
spoke
really
only
for
the
sake
of
sounding
as
if
all
differences
had
been
forgotten
but
a
more
sentence
could
not
have
fallen
from
her
lips
i
suppose
you
you
glad
to
be
rid
of
me
said
alma
her
lips
quivering
anyway
you
have
charlotte
and
she
ever
so
much
more
congenial
with
you
than
i
am
nancy
did
not
answer
if
alma
had
not
made
that
last
reference
to
charlotte
she
would
have
had
nancy
back
in
a
moment
but
there
is
a
little
devil
who
takes
a
delight
in
twisting
people
tongues
when
they
most
need
to
be
inspired
with
the
right
thing
to
say
with
her
and
over
her
arm
and
her
in
her
hand
alma
walked
in
silence
to
the
door
there
she
paused
and
like
lot
wife
flung
back
at
nancy
one
piteous
parting
look
which
alas
met
only
the
back
of
nancy
head
the
door
closed
nancy
sprang
up
and
crossed
the
room
running
while
the
spools
from
her
overturned
basket
rolled
off
placidly
under
the
bed
then
she
paused
pride
conquered
the
tenderness
in
her
heart
at
that
moment
bringing
in
its
trail
a
sequence
of
unhappy
days
no
wo
do
to
admit
i
wrong
i
not
and
i
just
let
her
find
it
out
and
having
voiced
this
stern
resolution
she
flung
herself
down
on
the
bed
and
burying
her
face
in
the
pillows
cried
herself
into
a
doze
while
separated
from
her
by
a
thin
partition
of
lath
and
plaster
alma
made
up
her
new
bed
and
bedewed
it
with
her
doleful
tears

the
ogre
reappears
hope
you
have
forgotten
that
you
bound
yourself
in
an
engagement
with
me
for
the
theatre
nannie
old
dear
called
charlotte
from
her
customary
location
during
leisure
hours
namely
the
piano
bench
i
reserved
seats
for
countess
betsey
nice
light
loads
of
good
viennese
tunes
nothing
lofty
about
it
miss
drinkwater
had
a
cute
little
plan
for
us
wanted
us
to
go
to
hear
or
see
i
know
just
what
the
right
word
is
some
production
of
euripides
in
the
original
i
said
very
politely
too
politely
perhaps
i
had
to
repeat
it
three
separate
and
distinct
times
i
explained
to
her
that
while
i
just
adored
euripides
and
loved
nothing
better
than
greek
as
she
is
spoke
my
constitution
craved
something
a
bit
gayer
than
in
the
original
i
hinted
modestly
that
i
been
overworking
a
bit
lately
and
that
my
mighty
brain
needed
something
that
it
have
to
chew
times
before
swallowing
are
you
going
to
thank
me
oh
i
do
thanks
laughed
nancy
ca
you
see
us
sitting
through
a
merry
little
greek
play
trying
to
weep
in
the
right
places
and
not
to
laugh
when
everyone
but
the
villainess
had
been
stabbed
or
poisoned
or
fed
to
the
lions
gee
but
could
we
be
lofty
when
we
got
back
said
charlotte
say
sublime
were
those
lines
in
act
ii
scene
where
in
a
voice
thrilling
with
sublime
hate
the
frenzied
woman
shrieks
logos
nike
anthropos
socrates
and
you
would
glow
with
fervor
and
say
mou
sas
i
tell
you
what
when
it
comes
to
dead
languages
it
too
late
i
hope
for
you
to
get
enthusiastic
about
the
idea
now
interrupted
nancy
firmly
it
would
be
a
bit
unlike
you
to
get
so
carried
away
with
it
that
you
suddenly
change
your
mind
about
not
going
and
i
tell
you
right
now
that
if
you
do
i
am
emphatically
with
you
i
do
like
to
improve
my
mind
when
on
a
holiday
and
saturdays
come
only
once
a
week
you
should
thirst
for
every
opportunity
to
improve
your
understanding
reproved
charlotte
who
could
chatter
away
like
a
magpie
while
her
nimble
fingers
never
lost
a
note
or
stumbled
in
the
rhythm
of
the
lively
dance
tune
she
was
playing
do
forget
little
party
alma
said
mildred
lloyd
mademoiselle
is
going
to
chaperone
us
i
asked
her
yesterday
going
in
on
the
and
the
boys
are
going
to
meet
us
at
delmonico
at
one
charlotte
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
nancy
she
understood
that
alma
possessed
all
this
information
already
and
that
mildred
was
making
the
announcement
simply
to
excite
the
other
girls
curiosity
since
their
quarrel
alma
and
nancy
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
outward
appearances
had
called
an
armistice
but
while
nancy
had
not
confided
the
first
hint
of
the
quarrel
to
charlotte
poor
alma
who
could
never
smother
anything
in
her
own
heart
had
unbosomed
herself
completely
to
mildred
needless
to
say
mildred
who
had
disliked
nancy
from
the
beginning
was
not
warmed
toward
her
by
any
of
the
details
in
narrative
that
concerned
herself
she
knew
that
alma
had
not
told
nancy
about
their
arrangements
to
go
to
the
theatre
meeting
two
boys
in
town
of
whom
frank
barrows
was
to
be
alma
cavalier
and
consequently
she
surmised
quite
correctly
that
nancy
would
be
hurt
when
she
spoke
about
the
plan
alma
shot
a
quick
uncertain
look
at
her
sister
and
blushed
but
nancy
only
smiled
and
asked
casually
what
are
you
going
to
see
alma
expression
changed
to
one
of
relief
trixie
are
we
mildred
everyone
says
it
a
scream
and
the
music
is
perfect
i
wanted
to
go
to
a
regular
play
but
then
i
thought
the
boys
would
like
a
musical
comedy
better
by
the
way
alma
i
think
i
ask
miss
leland
to
let
us
go
in
on
the
i
want
to
do
some
shopping
it
get
us
in
at
eleven
and
we
have
two
hours
i
promised
madame
lepage
that
i
come
in
to
talk
over
a
dress
i
want
for
the
holidays
and
then
i
simply
got
to
get
a
new
hat
the
following
morning
after
the
first
study
period
which
closed
the
labors
of
the
day
at
nancy
heard
a
timid
knock
at
the
door
it
was
alma
gloved
and
bonneted
in
her
but
with
an
agitated
expression
that
was
to
her
festive
appearance
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
seen
nancy
alone
since
the
night
of
their
quarrel
oh
charlotte
not
here
is
she
she
said
evidently
much
relieved
no
she
walked
up
to
the
village
to
post
a
letter
we
are
going
in
until
the
did
you
want
to
see
her
no
oh
no
you
see
i
i
alma
stammered
turning
scarlet
and
fidgeting
nervously
with
the
button
on
her
glove
you
see
i
wondered
if
you
could
lend
me
lend
me
just
a
little
bit
of
money
i
i
pay
it
right
back
you
see
i
do
want
mildred
i
mean
this
is
a
sort
of
dutch
treat
why
of
course
laughed
nancy
touched
and
a
little
bit
hurt
by
alma
embarrassment
heretofore
they
had
borrowed
and
lent
to
each
other
without
the
thought
of
explaining
why
they
needed
the
money
and
her
sister
constraint
marked
with
painful
clearness
her
sense
of
the
coldness
between
them
how
much
do
you
want
could
you
lend
me
ten
dollars
or
seven
would
do
i
wo
use
it
all
of
course
but
but
it
better
to
have
it
ten
dollars
was
a
good
bit
more
than
either
of
the
girls
had
spent
on
any
pleasure
before
the
porterbridges
dance
but
nancy
said
nothing
and
going
to
her
top
bureau
drawer
took
out
her
pocketbook
and
gave
alma
the
bill
without
a
second
glance
into
the
purse
oh
you
oh
nancy
alma
looked
into
her
sister
face
and
the
tears
came
suddenly
to
her
eyes
goodness
you
do
have
to
thank
me
like
that
said
nancy
flushing
you
know
that
it
no
more
my
money
than
yours
dear
you
you
so
good
to
me
nancy
i
did
mean
and
all
at
once
alma
who
could
restrain
her
sweet
impulses
no
more
easily
than
her
weak
ones
flung
her
arms
around
nancy
and
burst
out
crying
oh
darling
nancy
do
be
angry
with
me
any
more
i
ca
bear
it
alma
dearest
angry
oh
i
so
glad
so
glad
cried
nancy
in
tears
too
they
clung
together
fiercely
every
hard
word
forgotten
in
the
joy
of
making
up
there
darling
you
miss
your
train
there
now
it
all
just
as
it
was
oh
see
your
hat
all
over
your
eye
they
began
to
laugh
tremulously
you
better
put
a
little
cold
water
on
your
face
sweetheart
and
dust
a
little
powder
over
it
they
hugged
each
other
again
and
as
alma
ran
down
the
hall
nancy
stood
at
the
door
watching
her
with
brighter
eyes
than
she
had
had
for
a
week
but
when
alma
had
disappeared
below
the
landing
of
the
stairs
she
walked
back
into
the
room
with
a
sober
expression
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
she
went
again
to
the
top
bureau
drawer
to
get
out
her
gloves
and
then
thinking
for
the
first
time
of
the
amount
of
money
she
had
left
herself
realized
that
she
could
have
barely
sufficient
if
that
to
defray
her
expenses
of
her
own
day
in
town
each
of
the
girls
had
taken
fifteen
dollars
to
last
them
as
pocket
money
up
until
thanksgiving
a
little
she
had
already
spent
on
ribbons
and
so
on
and
she
had
given
alma
ten
a
glance
into
her
purse
showed
her
to
her
dismay
that
she
had
left
herself
exactly
cents
she
knew
of
course
that
she
could
easily
borrow
from
charlotte
but
this
she
was
absolutely
unwilling
to
do
first
because
she
did
not
want
to
have
to
write
to
her
mother
for
more
money
and
secondly
because
she
did
not
want
to
do
anything
that
she
would
not
have
alma
do
to
borrow
from
charlotte
was
one
thing
but
to
have
alma
follow
her
precedent
was
unwise
for
in
the
first
place
alma
would
borrow
from
mildred
lloyd
or
kay
leonard
and
in
the
second
place
alma
might
not
know
just
where
to
set
her
limits
nancy
dropped
the
purse
and
shut
the
drawer
quietly
after
all
she
told
herself
she
had
not
deprived
herself
of
so
much
pleasure
that
she
should
pity
herself
it
was
a
beautiful
day
clear
and
sparkling
and
she
would
enjoy
herself
just
as
much
on
a
walk
across
country
as
at
the
countess
betsey
nancy
had
the
happy
faculty
of
banishing
any
regrets
for
a
pleasure
which
she
could
not
reasonably
take
and
finding
a
substitute
for
it
with
perfect
cheerfulness
the
prospect
of
a
free
day
which
she
could
spend
as
she
liked
was
as
full
of
attraction
for
her
as
her
original
plan
for
the
matinée
had
been
and
when
charlotte
strolled
in
upon
her
she
was
whistling
softly
as
she
pulled
on
her
scarlet
listen
charlotte
do
kill
me
but
i
afraid
i
got
to
stay
here
after
all
do
you
mind
awfully
naturally
she
could
not
give
the
reasons
for
her
default
on
the
theatre
party
and
because
she
had
forgotten
to
think
up
a
plausible
excuse
she
flushed
slightly
oh
come
now
howled
charlotte
in
dismay
you
ca
do
anything
like
that
there
not
an
earthly
reason
why
you
should
stay
here
and
you
know
it
then
quickly
her
singularly
delicate
tact
warned
her
not
to
press
nancy
the
very
fact
that
her
friend
had
not
given
a
reason
for
breaking
their
engagement
was
enough
for
charlotte
to
know
that
she
should
not
ask
for
one
the
two
girls
understood
each
other
so
well
that
they
knew
instinctively
when
to
respect
one
another
silences
well
if
you
ca
you
ca
i
suppose
she
said
quietly
awfully
sorry
but
we
can
go
in
next
saturday
if
you
have
anything
to
do
however
there
no
point
in
my
staying
around
out
here
i
go
on
in
anyway
do
you
want
me
to
get
anything
for
you
not
a
thing
replied
nancy
feeling
an
intense
gratitude
toward
charlotte
for
not
disputing
her
decision
with
her
i
glad
you
are
going
well
sit
down
and
talk
to
me
while
i
dressing
alma
gone
she
yes
oh
wear
your
brown
hat
charlotte
the
one
with
the
little
feather
on
it
my
dear
what
does
it
matter
drinkwater
wo
appreciate
it
does
matter
you
be
a
thing
of
beauty
whether
she
knows
it
or
not
and
that
reason
enough
for
wearing
it
want
me
to
bring
out
a
pound
of
those
scrumptious
soft
chocolates
from
mailliards
then
we
can
have
a
regular
festival
on
if
you
a
good
girl
while
i
gone
when
charlotte
had
taken
her
departure
nancy
who
had
walked
over
to
the
station
with
her
struck
out
through
the
village
for
a
good
walk
before
luncheon
the
country
beyond
broadmore
was
picturesque
and
nancy
loved
nothing
better
than
to
swing
along
without
plan
or
purpose
cutting
across
a
field
here
or
turning
into
a
bit
of
glowing
woodland
there
as
her
fancy
prompted
in
her
short
full
skirt
her
small
feet
laced
into
sturdy
boots
she
could
negotiate
fences
and
brooks
with
the
freedom
of
a
boy
revelling
in
a
feeling
of
adventurousness
and
liberty
the
sun
had
melted
the
frost
of
the
early
morning
the
ground
was
soft
and
the
air
mild
though
bracing
in
the
wide
puddles
which
had
gathered
in
the
depressions
of
the
country
roads
a
sky
mottled
with
huge
lazy
clouds
was
reflected
a
cock
crowed
on
some
distant
haystack
now
and
then
a
mischievous
wind
rose
bending
the
long
brown
grass
as
it
swept
along
and
making
nancy
catch
her
breath
in
a
sort
of
jubilant
excitement
as
it
blew
into
her
face
and
spun
out
wisps
of
her
hair
behind
her
she
had
turned
after
about
two
miles
of
walking
and
was
approaching
the
pike
on
the
school
side
of
the
railroad
station
when
she
heard
behind
her
the
patient
creaking
of
the
old
hack
and
the
familiar
clucking
of
the
driver
to
his
lean
and
melancholy
steed
as
it
came
beside
her
she
glanced
up
curiously
then
her
eyes
grew
round
and
she
stared
in
incredulous
amazement
for
bolt
upright
on
the
decrepit
back
seat
his
head
erect
under
its
black
felt
hat
his
thin
hands
folded
on
the
crook
of
his
cane
sat
her
uncle
thomas
she
lacked
breath
to
speak
to
him
but
just
then
he
turned
his
eyes
and
saw
her
for
a
moment
he
merely
gazed
at
her
without
a
glimmer
of
recognition
and
she
had
half
persuaded
herself
that
his
brief
visit
to
the
cottage
had
not
been
long
enough
to
have
fixed
her
features
in
his
mind
when
his
face
suddenly
broke
into
an
almost
boyish
smile
hey
driver
stop
whoa
why
my
dear
child
bless
me
this
is
very
fortunate
with
one
foot
on
the
step
he
leaned
out
and
clasped
her
hand
get
in
get
in
my
dear
i
was
on
my
way
to
see
you
and
i
nearly
missed
you
eh
nancy
clambered
up
beside
him
and
the
driver
not
receiving
any
orders
to
the
contrary
clucked
to
his
steed
which
continued
on
its
interrupted
way
were
you
really
going
to
visit
us
uncle
asked
nancy
it
a
pity
that
alma
is
here
she
went
in
to
the
city
and
it
was
just
luck
that
i
did
go
too
she
smiled
to
herself
wondering
if
after
all
providence
had
had
some
hand
in
the
events
of
the
morning
which
had
kept
her
where
she
was
luck
well
i
should
say
so
i
have
been
badly
disappointed
if
my
surprise
had
fallen
through
chuckled
uncle
thomas
who
was
evidently
in
the
best
of
spirits
well
well
you
as
ruddy
as
a
ripe
pomegranate
my
dear
i
just
walked
four
miles
said
nancy
walked
by
yourself
now
that
a
taste
you
inherited
from
me
fond
of
walking
are
you
now
tell
me
how
you
are
getting
along
at
school
i
mean
like
it
eh
he
looked
at
her
keenly
a
twinkle
hiding
just
under
the
surface
of
his
gray
eyes
yes
i
like
it
i
working
awfully
hard
i
have
to
or
i
get
anywhere
because
it
would
be
awfully
easy
to
loaf
at
miss
leland
laughed
nancy
she
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
waiting
to
get
her
opinion
of
the
school
and
she
was
afraid
of
sounding
priggish
or
as
if
she
were
trying
to
impress
him
with
an
idea
of
her
industry
so
she
chatted
away
about
the
girls
telling
him
about
charlotte
particularly
describing
the
teachers
giving
him
an
account
of
the
routine
and
so
on
to
all
of
which
he
listened
as
intently
as
if
he
were
her
father
so
you
swimming
along
good
and
how
is
my
other
niece
is
she
working
very
hard
has
she
made
lots
of
friends
eh
again
nancy
felt
that
he
was
pumping
her
but
she
told
him
casually
about
alma
taking
care
to
say
nothing
that
might
sound
as
if
she
said
it
for
effect
and
he
listened
nodding
his
head
and
smiling
well
now
even
if
we
ca
have
alma
with
us
what
do
you
say
to
giving
up
a
holiday
to
an
old
gentleman
is
that
too
much
to
ask
the
whim
took
me
to
run
over
here
and
kidnap
my
two
nieces
but
if
i
can
only
have
one
i
take
her
if
she
let
me
will
your
let
you
come
away
with
me
i
like
to
have
you
until
and
i
get
you
back
safe
and
sound
nancy
laughed
six
months
before
if
anyone
had
told
her
that
she
would
be
going
to
visit
her
uncle
thomas
on
that
particular
day
she
would
have
thought
the
prophet
quite
mad
as
it
was
she
could
hardly
believe
her
ears
i
to
do
it
here
the
school
now
it
wo
take
me
a
minute
to
get
ready
you
speak
to
miss
leland
uncle
thomas
i
quite
sure
that
i
can
go
a
little
more
than
an
hour
later
nancy
found
herself
turning
in
the
very
old
gate
through
the
unfriendly
bars
of
which
she
and
alma
had
peered
on
that
distant
rainy
afternoon
feeling
that
they
were
gazing
into
a
forbidden
country
yet
now
nothing
it
seemed
could
be
more
natural
than
that
she
should
be
sitting
beside
her
uncle
chatting
away
with
him
unconstrainedly
only
the
fact
that
he
never
mentioned
her
mother
nor
suggested
that
she
should
even
peep
into
the
little
brown
house
made
her
feel
uncomfortable
furthermore
he
showed
the
same
coldness
on
the
subject
of
alma
so
that
in
a
way
nancy
felt
that
somehow
she
had
almost
unfairly
won
his
affection
for
herself
alone
and
that
she
was
enjoying
a
pleasure
in
which
her
mother
and
sister
should
have
had
an
equal
share
on
the
other
hand
she
decided
at
length
to
say
nothing
either
to
alma
or
to
prescott
about
her
visit
only
because
she
was
afraid
that
the
knowledge
of
it
might
again
lead
them
to
false
hopes
and
to
follies
stimulated
by
those
hopes
she
felt
sure
that
her
uncle
had
come
to
see
her
only
because
he
had
taken
her
at
her
word
that
is
to
say
that
he
counted
on
her
not
in
any
way
misunderstanding
the
purpose
of
his
visit
or
fancying
that
it
gave
promise
of
his
relenting
in
his
determination
not
to
solve
their
financial
problems
for
them
aside
from
the
fact
that
although
within
a
mile
of
the
little
brown
cottage
she
might
have
been
a
league
away
and
that
she
experienced
several
bad
qualms
of
homesickness
nancy
thoroughly
enjoyed
that
day
she
lunched
with
her
uncle
in
the
big
sitting
at
the
head
of
his
table
while
he
placed
himself
at
the
foot
and
afterwards
he
showed
her
about
the
huge
old
house
taking
her
to
his
laboratory
explaining
a
great
deal
about
scientific
experiments
which
she
did
not
understand
showing
her
his
books
and
his
curios
as
they
passed
along
the
corridor
on
the
second
floor
he
paused
a
moment
outside
a
room
which
was
closed
then
as
if
on
a
sudden
impulse
he
took
a
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
opened
the
door
without
saying
anything
it
was
a
small
room
rather
bare
furnished
with
an
almost
spartan
simplicity
the
sunlight
beamed
in
striking
its
full
red
rays
on
the
faded
wall
above
the
narrow
white
iron
bed
over
which
hung
a
picture
of
a
evidently
cut
out
of
some
book
or
magazine
just
such
a
picture
as
would
strike
the
imagination
of
a
lad
of
twelve
the
rest
of
the
wall
was
mottled
with
other
pictures
many
of
them
unframed
clipped
out
of
colored
newspapers
and
fixed
to
the
with
pins
pictures
of
horses
and
and
greek
athletes
and
american
heroes
one
the
largest
was
a
vivid
representation
of
the
battle
of
trafalgar
showing
a
perfect
inferno
of
red
and
yellow
flames
and
bursting
bombs
and
splintered
ships
and
drowning
sailors
clinging
to
planks
and
spars
on
the
table
between
the
windows
stood
a
row
of
books
a
few
looking
lesson
books
hobnobbing
like
poor
relations
with
other
more
works
on
woodcraft
and
adventure
the
mantelpiece
was
burdened
with
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
boyish
knickknacks
such
as
a
sling
a
a
rusty
and
a
decrepit
old
for
a
moment
nancy
looked
about
her
in
astonishment
then
as
she
understood
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
she
looked
up
at
her
uncle
the
room
had
not
been
changed
since
her
father
had
left
it
for
twenty
thirty
years
before
prescott
said
nothing
but
after
a
moment
closed
the
door
locked
it
again
and
walked
away
i
going
to
have
visitors
for
tea
he
remarked
to
turn
the
subject
it
quite
an
eventful
day
for
me
i
rarely
see
anyone
as
you
know
but
i
thought
that
it
might
be
pleasant
for
you
to
renew
an
acquaintance
with
a
lady
who
seems
to
have
taken
a
great
fancy
to
you
and
who
incidentally
is
the
only
woman
i
know
who
has
a
allowance
of
common
sense
though
at
times
she
is
very
unreasonable
and
quite
as
inconsistent
as
any
of
her
sex
nancy
looked
at
him
inquiringly
and
he
explained
miss
elizabeth
bancroft
whether
he
considered
miss
bancroft
in
the
plural
as
being
a
lady
of
many
parts
or
whether
he
had
used
the
word
visitors
because
she
would
be
accompanied
or
followed
by
others
and
if
so
how
many
others
he
expected
he
did
not
trouble
himself
to
make
clear
but
the
matter
explained
itself
when
toward
five
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
rattled
out
on
the
gravel
drive
and
in
due
time
miss
bancroft
laboriously
descended
from
her
equipage
assisted
by
her
nephew
george
arnold
my
dear
child
how
delightful
this
is
i
so
really
glad
to
see
you
exclaimed
miss
bancroft
taking
nancy
hands
in
both
her
own
as
if
she
had
known
her
all
her
life
her
frank
cordial
manner
sent
a
glow
of
pleasure
to
nancy
cheeks
i
hope
you
remember
that
you
met
my
nephew
for
his
sake
the
idea
that
you
might
possibly
have
forgotten
him
has
been
troubling
his
vanity
for
a
good
eight
hours
nancy
laughingly
murmuring
that
she
did
remember
arnold
and
blushing
with
shyness
shook
hands
with
him
she
noticed
without
dreaming
of
connecting
the
fact
with
herself
that
he
seemed
to
be
in
remarkably
good
spirits
and
that
they
quite
overflowed
when
he
told
her
how
nice
it
was
to
see
her
again
and
what
a
jolly
funny
sort
of
party
the
whole
thing
was
anyway
i
was
going
to
bring
george
observed
miss
bancroft
usually
so
tiresomely
lazy
about
tearing
himself
away
from
his
books
or
his
own
company
that
i
thought
i
would
bother
him
then
lo
and
behold
he
gets
into
an
unbearable
fit
of
sulks
complains
that
always
ready
enough
to
drag
him
around
with
people
who
bore
him
to
death
and
leave
him
alone
whenever
anyone
interesting
turns
up
in
a
word
goes
into
a
tantrum
and
all
but
weeps
with
rage
so
i
had
to
bring
him
with
that
she
indulged
in
a
chuckle
of
mischievous
laughter
and
patted
nancy
cheek
a
big
crackled
noisily
inside
the
huge
stone
chimney
place
in
the
and
around
it
they
all
gathered
in
that
comfortable
sociable
spirit
which
is
the
characteristic
mood
for
everyone
felt
that
they
had
really
known
everyone
else
rather
longer
than
they
had
and
while
miss
bancroft
poured
out
their
tea
and
chattered
away
with
uncle
thomas
who
stood
upright
on
the
drinking
his
tea
from
the
mantelpiece
nancy
and
arnold
chatted
away
as
if
it
were
impossible
to
say
everything
they
wanted
to
in
the
course
of
one
short
hour
or
so
as
a
rule
nancy
had
a
very
hard
time
overcoming
her
shyness
when
she
had
to
talk
to
a
young
man
she
always
felt
that
she
might
say
something
that
they
would
understand
or
which
they
might
think
affected
or
priggish
which
were
the
two
last
sins
in
the
world
which
she
would
have
wished
to
be
accused
of
or
with
which
anyone
could
accuse
her
but
with
arnold
she
lost
every
atom
of
he
had
travelled
a
great
deal
and
he
had
seen
the
world
through
a
prism
of
mingled
humor
and
sensitiveness
which
gave
his
conversation
the
charm
of
a
very
original
viewpoint
on
everything
he
told
her
droll
stories
about
his
school
days
in
england
and
switzerland
recounted
innumerable
anecdotes
about
the
various
people
he
had
seen
many
of
whom
were
celebrated
for
their
brains
or
their
follies
and
altogether
managed
to
make
an
hour
shorter
than
many
a
minute
and
in
some
way
while
he
talked
he
had
a
way
of
flattering
the
shy
young
girl
not
by
words
but
by
a
hundred
indescribable
little
attentions
paid
unconsciously
no
doubt
and
simply
because
he
was
thoroughly
delighted
to
see
her
again
my
dear
you
must
fail
to
pay
me
a
visit
during
the
holidays
miss
bancroft
urged
remember
that
your
father
was
a
very
great
favorite
of
mine
and
i
should
like
to
be
a
favorite
of
yours
if
uncle
thomas
does
supplant
me
quite
the
old
lady
bent
and
kissed
nancy
warmly
as
she
prepared
to
take
her
departure
when
the
carriage
had
driven
away
nancy
and
her
uncle
sat
before
the
fire
for
a
long
time
to
remember
that
afternoon
was
always
a
delight
to
nancy
and
she
particularly
liked
to
recall
the
memory
of
sitting
there
as
the
dusk
grew
deeper
in
the
room
and
the
daylight
faded
away
into
pale
tints
and
then
into
a
deep
quiet
blue
while
they
sat
and
watched
the
fire
the
flames
had
died
down
but
the
long
logs
were
wrapped
in
a
hot
red
glow
and
every
now
and
then
they
would
pop
softly
and
a
spark
would
drop
down
into
the
ruddy
embers
when
dinner
was
over
they
sat
by
that
fireside
until
bedtime
chatting
away
with
a
thoroughly
delightful
sense
of
camaraderie
absolutely
forgetting
her
mother
and
sister
ground
of
interest
in
uncle
thomas
nancy
talked
to
him
quite
freely
about
her
ambitions
without
the
slightest
feeling
of
constraint
impressing
him
unconsciously
more
than
she
could
have
done
by
the
most
fervid
protestations
with
her
sincerely
eager
wish
to
make
her
life
for
herself
and
by
herself
and
he
liked
her
earnest
youthful
spirit
of
independence
perfectly
innocent
of
any
pose
of
which
to
a
man
like
prescott
would
have
constituted
one
of
the
most
unforgivable
of
feminine
failings
ranking
equally
with
the
other
extreme
of
which
poor
pretty
helpless
prescott
was
an
example
so
you
want
to
work
your
way
through
college
what
the
idea
he
asked
a
bit
gruffly
a
pretty
girl
like
you
i
should
think
would
only
be
planning
to
marry
and
settle
down
in
a
home
of
her
own
nancy
colored
that
would
be
awfully
nice
but
one
ca
make
it
a
business
uncle
thomas
or
all
the
niceness
would
go
out
of
it
i
think
one
ought
to
plan
out
all
the
difficult
things
and
leave
all
the
the
dreadfully
nice
things
to
chance
or
providence
or
well
just
let
them
happen
where
they
belong
you
a
little
madame
solomon
are
you
eh
said
uncle
thomas
with
a
short
chuckle
and
how
are
you
going
to
work
your
way
through
college
i
should
think
that
miss
leland
would
be
exactly
the
place
for
a
young
lady
with
your
ideas
it
would
be
if
i
aired
them
all
over
the
place
but
i
learned
to
keep
my
ideas
to
myself
said
nancy
thinking
how
mildred
lloyd
would
scoff
at
her
highbrow
ambitions
uncle
thomas
shot
a
quick
keen
glance
at
her
from
under
his
bushy
brows
well
you
are
a
wise
young
lady
now
who
in
the
world
taught
you
that
to
keep
your
ideas
to
yourself
eh
why
there
nothing
very
wise
in
that
said
nancy
surprised
at
his
tone
of
warm
approval
i
know
what
i
want
and
if
i
with
people
who
think
it
a
foolish
thing
to
want
why
i
do
talk
about
it
all
well
my
dear
permit
me
to
say
that
i
think
that
in
time
you
are
going
to
have
even
more
sense
than
my
good
elizabeth
you
you
are
laughing
at
me
uncle
thomas
do
you
think
i
trying
to
show
off
asked
nancy
timidly
unwilling
to
believe
his
sincere
praise
and
she
looked
anxiously
and
shyly
into
his
face
to
detect
a
smile
if
there
was
one
but
there
was
laughing
at
you
my
dear
child
what
nonsense
bless
my
soul
but
you
are
certainly
my
boy
daughter
then
after
a
short
silence
and
just
as
nancy
was
on
the
point
of
telling
him
an
amusing
little
incident
about
charlotte
he
interrupted
her
abruptly
and
irrelevantly
i
say
you
like
that
young
man
eh
what
young
man
gasped
nancy
turning
scarlet
young
man
repeated
uncle
thomas
pettishly
boy
arnold
that
author
yes
bless
me
did
he
tell
you
how
famous
he
is
do
you
like
him
i
say
uncle
thomas
was
quite
fierce
why
yes
i
think
he
awfully
nice
i
i
do
know
him
very
well
said
nancy
in
astonishment
hum
well
he
a
nice
fellow
clever
chap
elizabeth
dotes
on
him
but
he
does
let
her
think
for
him
but
he
not
good
enough
for
you
you
go
along
to
college
if
you
wo
get
any
silly
notions
about
marrying
and
all
that
nonsense
i
i
well
maybe
i
give
you
a
lift
here
and
there
though
it
strictly
against
my
principles
after
which
involved
and
very
cryptic
remark
uncle
thomas
stiffly
offered
her
his
cheek
to
kiss
and
sent
her
to
bed
chapter
xi
alma
makes
complications
charlotte
was
sitting
in
the
easy
chair
which
she
had
imported
to
her
new
lodging
with
the
rest
of
her
belongings
munching
peanuts
her
bushy
brown
hair
was
pinned
up
into
a
droll
little
nubbin
on
top
of
her
head
her
goggles
had
slipped
down
almost
to
the
tip
of
her
nose
and
altogether
her
attitude
when
nancy
burst
in
upon
her
late
on
sunday
afternoon
gave
evidence
that
she
was
in
a
thoughtful
mood
she
had
often
said
that
peanuts
always
disposed
her
to
meditation
with
her
feet
on
the
she
gazed
out
upon
a
rather
dreary
scene
of
fog
and
rain
hardly
blinking
her
big
eyes
and
devouring
peanuts
like
an
automaton
but
the
unchanging
gravity
of
her
face
as
she
turned
around
to
greet
her
prodigal
roommate
told
nancy
that
there
was
really
some
serious
matter
on
her
friend
mind
hello
have
a
good
time
was
her
only
greeting
very
did
you
like
the
play
yesterday
i
i
hope
you
understood
why
i
i
mean
after
i
had
told
you
that
i
had
to
stay
here
nancy
you
know
you
do
have
to
explain
anything
to
me
if
you
could
go
with
me
do
you
suppose
that
i
knew
that
you
had
your
own
reasons
for
not
going
interrupted
charlotte
warmly
my
idea
of
real
friends
as
they
call
is
of
two
people
who
know
when
not
to
bother
each
other
with
questions
the
reason
why
most
of
these
ardent
friendships
come
to
violent
deaths
is
because
they
insist
on
telling
each
other
everything
and
demanding
an
explanation
for
every
why
and
wherefore
and
that
that
take
off
your
things
and
have
a
peanut
or
even
two
if
you
like
nancy
tossed
her
hat
on
the
bed
and
began
to
take
off
her
heavy
clothes
you
seemed
sort
of
grave
charlotte
when
i
came
in
has
anything
happened
she
asked
as
she
slipped
into
her
and
shook
down
her
hair
well
in
a
way
yes
replied
charlotte
nothing
to
worry
you
really
and
it
really
not
my
affair
except
that
it
concerns
you
and
alma
it
only
that
i
afraid
that
that
donkey
mildred
lloyd
got
alma
into
rather
a
scrape
yesterday
oh
do
look
so
scared
all
fixed
up
only
if
i
were
you
i
have
a
good
talk
with
alma
about
mildred
but
what
happened
cried
nancy
who
had
turned
quite
pale
in
spite
of
charlotte
hasty
reassurances
well
the
chief
trouble
was
that
they
overstayed
their
time
in
town
yesterday
ten
is
the
very
latest
that
any
of
us
can
come
in
on
a
holiday
as
you
know
and
as
they
knew
and
as
that
little
pinhead
mademoiselle
knew
it
seems
that
one
of
the
boys
persuaded
them
to
stay
in
for
dinner
and
to
go
to
the
theatre
again
afterwards
so
they
did
get
in
until
after
twelve
well
as
you
can
imagine
amelia
went
on
a
regular
rampage
and
i
a
notion
that
she
was
a
good
deal
harder
on
poor
alma
than
she
was
on
mildred
amelia
is
more
afraid
of
angering
mildred
than
mildred
is
of
angering
her
mildred
always
takes
mademoiselle
as
her
chaperone
because
she
is
quite
sure
of
being
able
to
make
that
little
poodle
do
anything
she
wants
and
mildred
being
the
daughter
of
marshall
lloyd
is
here
and
can
wriggle
out
of
any
scrape
i
know
mildred
down
to
the
ground
i
roomed
with
her
for
a
year
for
some
reason
or
other
she
never
tried
to
coax
me
into
any
rule
breaking
probably
because
we
were
never
intimate
at
all
and
because
she
knew
that
i
do
think
there
any
fun
or
sense
in
that
sort
of
thing
it
does
take
any
great
cleverness
to
break
a
rule
and
you
do
get
anything
much
by
doing
so
if
you
want
my
opinion
i
think
that
mildred
is
a
very
unsafe
sort
of
friend
for
a
girl
like
alma
i
do
believe
that
alma
honestly
likes
her
mildred
is
more
than
inclined
to
be
a
bully
and
extremely
capricious
but
somehow
a
lot
of
girls
feel
flattered
when
mildred
them
up
and
will
do
anything
she
tells
them
to
without
using
their
own
common
sense
for
a
minute
i
saying
all
this
to
you
nancy
when
i
would
say
it
to
anyone
else
i
do
like
the
idea
of
picking
to
pieces
a
girl
whom
you
roomed
with
for
a
year
but
i
think
that
both
of
us
ought
to
try
to
make
alma
open
her
eyes
before
mildred
gets
her
into
any
more
mischief
nancy
sat
silent
for
a
time
staring
out
of
the
window
and
biting
her
finger
thoughtfully
she
longed
to
ask
charlotte
advice
but
she
hesitated
to
discuss
her
own
sister
even
with
this
very
close
and
sincere
friend
she
hated
to
admit
alma
weaknesses
even
to
herself
and
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
of
them
to
anyone
else
but
she
felt
very
uncertain
as
to
how
she
was
going
to
approach
alma
on
the
subject
of
her
friendship
with
mildred
for
in
spite
of
their
reconciliation
she
knew
that
alma
was
not
ready
to
take
any
warnings
without
flying
up
with
a
lot
of
notions
about
the
nobility
of
friendship
and
so
on
true
and
idealistic
notions
in
themselves
but
so
unwisely
applied
that
she
stood
in
danger
of
losing
them
altogether
through
disillusionment
i
think
alma
alone
now
have
you
seen
her
said
charlotte
the
poor
little
creature
has
been
awfully
unhappy
about
the
scolding
miss
leland
gave
her
mildred
was
at
all
cast
down
and
goes
around
looking
as
if
she
had
done
something
very
smart
the
very
fact
that
alma
is
feeling
so
blue
about
it
all
while
mildred
is
perfectly
unconcerned
shows
the
difference
in
the
sort
of
stuff
they
are
made
of
and
we
must
take
care
that
alma
does
change
under
influence
so
that
she
too
will
think
it
very
smart
to
get
into
silly
scrapes
just
for
the
fun
of
getting
out
of
them
nancy
sprang
up
and
without
a
word
left
the
room
there
was
no
light
in
her
sister
room
but
in
the
gray
twilight
that
shone
in
forlornly
she
made
out
a
pathetic
little
heap
on
the
bed
she
felt
a
lump
of
pity
and
motherly
tenderness
rise
in
her
throat
not
a
particle
of
blame
was
in
her
heart
only
a
desire
to
cuddle
and
comfort
her
thoughtless
little
sister
alma
she
called
softly
a
tousled
head
was
lifted
from
the
pillow
and
even
in
the
dim
light
she
could
see
how
alma
rosy
childlike
face
was
stained
and
swollen
with
tears
oh
nancy
i
so
glad
you
back
oh
do
be
angry
with
me
you
are
angry
are
you
sobbed
alma
angry
echoed
nancy
laughing
tremulously
oh
you
poor
little
darling
do
be
so
unhappy
about
it
all
she
hugged
alma
tightly
and
kissed
her
hot
cheek
feeling
the
tears
on
it
then
you
know
about
it
it
was
my
fault
nancy
that
is
it
was
milly
either
do
think
i
trying
to
shift
the
blame
oh
i
have
been
so
why
dearest
it
was
anything
very
bad
it
was
only
foolish
cheer
up
you
see
you
see
frank
was
there
and
another
boy
and
they
hated
to
go
back
to
cambridge
and
it
all
seemed
perfectly
harmless
and
milly
said
it
was
perfectly
all
right
and
that
miss
leland
would
care
a
bit
and
that
she
had
often
done
it
i
had
any
idea
until
i
thought
about
you
and
i
knew
you
would
like
it
but
i
did
think
about
that
until
we
were
coming
home
but
milly
just
laughed
what
did
miss
leland
say
to
you
she
she
was
furious
she
said
that
she
was
ashamed
of
me
and
that
she
was
going
to
write
to
mother
and
that
it
was
a
cheap
common
thing
to
do
nancy
eyes
blazed
for
a
moment
she
sat
perfectly
still
breathing
sharply
evidently
trying
to
conquer
her
temper
then
she
said
in
a
quiet
tone
she
had
no
business
to
say
that
to
you
i
going
to
speak
to
her
after
dinner
oh
do
nancy
implored
alma
timidly
it
all
right
now
i
i
do
want
you
to
say
anything
to
miss
leland
well
she
should
have
been
ashamed
of
herself
to
say
that
to
you
she
is
nothing
but
a
horrid
old
snob
i
wager
she
thought
twice
over
everything
she
said
to
mildred
nancy
eyes
were
still
fiery
she
was
beginning
to
taste
the
humiliation
of
having
to
submit
to
the
tyranny
of
snobs
if
she
went
to
miss
leland
it
would
end
most
likely
by
their
having
for
the
sake
of
their
pride
to
pack
up
and
go
home
and
she
felt
that
she
had
no
right
to
do
anything
that
would
so
wound
her
mother
alma
dearest
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
please
do
you
be
angry
with
me
now
please
dearest
you
know
that
i
have
a
single
thought
that
is
for
your
interest
and
that
i
would
for
anything
on
earth
try
to
take
away
from
you
anything
that
was
really
for
your
good
she
paused
waiting
for
alma
to
say
something
but
her
sister
was
silent
and
the
room
was
too
dim
now
for
her
to
read
the
expression
on
alma
face
i
think
that
you
have
already
seen
for
yourself
that
there
is
danger
in
a
friendship
where
one
person
lacks
a
well
a
very
keen
sense
of
honor
and
the
other
lacks
judgment
i
know
you
do
want
to
make
any
more
mistakes
you
have
been
very
unhappy
over
a
small
one
and
unless
you
are
wise
big
ones
may
follow
you
mean
you
want
me
to
to
not
be
friends
with
mildred
i
want
you
only
to
be
independent
dear
so
that
you
wo
be
afraid
to
do
what
you
know
is
right
and
wise
even
if
she
laughs
at
you
and
coaxes
you
i
do
like
to
criticize
mildred
to
you
if
you
are
very
fond
of
her
but
you
know
that
i
have
never
trusted
her
and
this
affair
ought
to
show
you
too
that
she
is
to
be
trusted
she
has
always
had
her
own
way
and
she
is
a
wise
girl
she
has
been
a
very
good
influence
for
you
as
you
must
have
seen
partly
because
of
her
influence
we
quarrelled
you
know
she
has
laughed
you
out
of
doing
many
things
that
you
know
well
you
should
have
done
i
am
not
blaming
you
alma
it
is
only
because
i
know
that
in
time
mildred
would
make
you
very
very
unhappy
that
i
telling
you
not
to
make
her
your
closest
friend
she
she
i
mean
that
in
many
ways
she
should
be
a
very
friend
to
have
began
alma
in
a
low
voice
oh
alma
darling
you
must
think
that
simply
because
a
girl
has
money
and
position
and
influence
that
she
is
on
the
face
of
that
a
valuable
friend
a
girl
like
mildred
is
very
fickle
anyway
she
may
want
to
do
everything
in
the
world
for
you
and
she
may
hardly
speak
to
you
so
long
as
you
follow
her
blindly
she
may
show
a
great
fancy
for
you
but
if
you
were
to
follow
your
own
ideas
contrary
to
her
she
would
quarrel
with
you
in
a
minute
i
do
believe
that
of
mildred
exclaimed
alma
with
sudden
defiance
you
have
no
idea
how
generous
she
is
and
and
how
i
sure
that
you
are
prejudiced
against
her
nancy
i
know
that
she
often
appears
to
be
rather
a
snob
but
in
reality
she
is
one
at
all
yesterday
was
no
more
her
fault
than
it
was
mine
i
was
just
as
wrong
as
she
was
yes
but
you
were
unhappy
because
you
had
done
it
and
mildred
unhappy
about
it
at
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
thinks
that
it
was
quite
a
clever
thing
to
do
alma
was
silent
then
she
said
presently
i
ca
quarrel
with
her
you
do
have
to
quarrel
with
her
i
never
asked
you
to
do
that
i
said
only
to
think
and
act
as
you
know
to
be
right
certainly
then
if
she
grows
cool
with
you
she
will
respect
you
more
i
i
hate
to
see
my
sister
so
absolutely
a
a
i
mean
i
hate
to
see
you
doing
blindly
everything
mildred
does
because
she
thinks
it
silly
and
to
study
hard
you
do
study
i
hate
to
see
you
so
afraid
to
lose
a
friend
that
you
will
go
against
your
own
conscience
and
judgment
just
to
keep
her
it
just
snobbery
alma
and
it
worse
than
even
mildred
snobbery
because
cowardly
while
hers
is
just
impudent
i
wo
let
you
say
such
things
nancy
cried
alma
shaking
off
her
sister
hand
i
i
could
go
on
rooming
with
mildred
if
i
believed
what
you
say
of
her
and
i
wo
listen
to
you
oh
alma
do
let
us
quarrel
again
pleaded
nancy
why
ca
you
believe
that
it
almost
unbearably
hard
for
me
to
say
these
things
to
you
i
am
a
coward
too
because
i
so
afraid
of
losing
one
little
jot
of
your
affection
that
i
would
rather
a
thousand
times
hold
my
tongue
than
say
anything
to
make
you
angry
but
i
ca
be
silent
you
made
me
more
unhappy
now
than
i
was
before
said
alma
sullenly
do
you
want
me
to
be
a
hypocrite
and
pretend
to
be
fond
of
mildred
still
while
i
believing
what
you
want
me
to
believe
of
her
nancy
got
up
feeling
quite
desperate
about
the
failure
of
her
attempts
to
show
alma
her
danger
while
she
was
thinking
of
something
to
say
she
walked
over
to
the
door
and
switched
on
the
light
just
as
she
turned
she
saw
alma
make
a
quick
movement
but
alma
was
not
quick
enough
to
grasp
a
handsome
fur
off
the
chair
and
whisk
it
behind
the
pillow
before
nancy
saw
her
alma
blushed
crimson
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
swift
action
and
the
guilty
blush
nancy
would
not
even
have
noticed
the
scarf
or
if
she
had
she
would
simply
have
thought
that
it
was
one
of
mildred
for
some
reason
she
flushed
herself
and
stood
staring
blankly
at
alma
curiously
ashamed
of
own
guilty
expression
then
alma
slowly
drew
the
scarf
from
its
and
tried
to
laugh
you
going
to
scold
me
for
my
extravagance
now
nancy
i
i
got
this
i
was
hiding
it
because
i
did
i
mean
i
was
afraid
you
might
read
me
a
lecture
she
attempted
an
air
of
playful
penitence
but
it
was
rather
a
failure
it
was
a
very
expensive
fur
long
and
fluffy
and
beautifully
lined
with
frilled
chiffon
but
alma
remonstrated
nancy
weakly
how
did
you
get
it
it
must
have
cost
at
least
a
hundred
dollars
why
she
broke
off
quite
dazed
and
frightened
at
the
thought
of
such
a
sum
and
stared
at
her
sister
as
if
she
thought
that
alma
had
taken
leave
of
her
senses
well
you
see
do
worry
nancy
stammered
alma
evidently
finding
the
greatest
difficulty
in
explaining
you
see
it
was
this
way
milly
oh
nancy
she
stopped
and
looked
at
her
sister
beseechingly
milly
wanted
me
to
get
it
and
she
offered
to
lend
me
the
money
she
begged
me
to
let
her
lend
it
to
me
and
i
can
pay
her
back
whenever
i
please
she
said
she
did
care
whether
i
paid
her
back
at
all
and
i
felt
so
shabby
in
that
old
suit
of
mine
and
i
hated
to
look
badly
when
frank
was
going
to
be
there
he
knows
ever
so
much
about
girls
clothes
and
i
look
positively
poor
beside
mildred
i
knew
mother
would
mind
in
fact
i
knew
that
it
would
hurt
her
pride
dreadfully
if
i
did
look
respectable
with
those
sort
of
people
and
the
fur
made
everything
else
look
just
right
oh
nancy
if
you
only
knew
how
it
me
to
be
with
girls
who
have
everything
who
look
so
much
nicer
than
i
do
just
because
they
have
prettier
clothes
i
know
it
was
wrong
of
me
but
could
resist
i
just
simply
could
nancy
bit
her
lip
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
always
being
thrust
into
a
position
where
she
must
needs
be
forever
preaching
to
alma
it
made
her
feel
old
and
uncomfortably
burdened
with
alma
she
always
felt
somewhat
as
a
staid
and
wise
old
duenna
must
feel
with
a
pretty
and
charmingly
unpractical
and
mischievous
charge
for
a
moment
she
was
on
the
point
of
shrugging
her
shoulders
and
determining
to
let
alma
go
ahead
as
she
pleased
she
had
no
desire
to
blame
alma
she
understood
too
well
the
force
of
the
temptations
that
surrounded
a
girl
like
alma
in
such
an
environment
as
miss
leland
school
and
she
was
touched
by
alma
if
you
knew
how
it
me
she
had
foreseen
just
that
when
she
had
urged
her
mother
not
to
send
them
to
miss
leland
she
herself
had
felt
that
very
same
sharp
flick
of
wounded
feminine
pride
when
she
compared
her
own
small
possessions
with
those
of
the
other
girls
and
realized
that
in
spite
of
the
neatness
of
her
clothes
they
must
often
appear
plain
to
the
point
of
poorness
in
comparison
with
mildred
or
kay
somehow
with
charlotte
in
spite
of
pretty
things
she
had
not
been
so
conscious
of
the
contrast
i
i
wish
you
had
tried
to
hide
it
from
me
alma
she
said
gently
are
you
of
me
am
i
always
scolding
you
nancy
of
course
not
cried
alma
in
distress
i
did
mean
to
hide
it
that
was
horribly
cowardly
i
that
it
was
weak
of
me
to
get
it
and
that
i
had
no
right
to
borrow
the
money
from
mildred
and
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
blame
me
awfully
but
dear
however
are
we
going
to
manage
to
pay
her
back
how
much
was
it
alma
looked
uncomfortable
it
really
was
a
bargain
nancy
a
a
hundred
and
ten
marked
down
from
a
hundred
and
forty
it
last
me
forever
a
hundred
and
ten
nancy
gasped
and
then
tried
to
compose
her
features
so
as
not
to
scare
alma
with
her
own
breathless
dismay
i
i
do
have
to
pay
her
until
i
get
ready
murmured
alma
i
know
milly
wo
even
think
of
it
again
you
ca
possibly
accept
it
as
a
present
alma
said
nancy
sternly
we
must
manage
to
pay
mildred
back
somehow
soon
she
is
the
last
person
in
the
world
whom
i
want
to
owe
anything
to
i
mean
to
say
that
people
in
our
position
put
themselves
under
obligations
to
a
girl
like
mildred
lloyd
it
different
if
you
can
return
it
in
some
other
way
for
instance
it
would
be
all
right
for
kay
leonard
to
accept
an
expensive
present
from
mildred
because
she
could
so
easily
return
it
but
for
one
of
us
to
is
like
accepting
a
charity
alma
looked
at
her
repentantly
out
of
two
large
grave
blue
eyes
i
i
afraid
i
rather
made
a
mess
of
everything
yesterday
nancy
she
said
hanging
her
head
and
picking
at
the
soft
fur
which
somehow
had
lost
a
good
deal
of
its
charm
for
her
then
all
at
once
evidently
touched
by
the
droll
naïveté
of
the
sad
remark
nancy
burst
out
laughing
you
poor
funny
lamb
i
always
worrying
you
to
death
she
said
do
bother
any
more
alma
i
sick
of
bothering
myself
manage
to
solve
the
problem
somehow
only
dearest
she
grew
sober
again
please
please
do
i
do
want
to
say
it
again
but
think
over
what
i
said
to
you
i
sure
that
you
will
see
that
i
very
nearly
right
come
now
you
better
tidy
yourself
i
going
to
dress
she
bent
over
alma
and
kissed
her
lightly
as
she
went
toward
the
door
mildred
met
her
they
looked
at
each
other
coolly
mildred
barely
giving
her
a
nonchalant
nod
and
then
ignoring
her
altogether
hello
do
tell
me
you
been
weeping
briny
tears
all
afternoon
over
what
leland
said
to
you
she
cried
gaily
to
alma
goodness
what
a
penitent
what
the
point
in
having
a
good
time
if
you
going
to
regret
it
like
that
i
have
the
right
idea
i
make
it
a
point
never
to
regret
anything
nancy
walked
slowly
back
to
her
own
room
and
dressed
for
dinner
in
silence
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
might
indeed
be
sick
of
bothering
but
that
did
not
prevent
there
being
a
good
deal
for
her
to
bother
about
chapter
xii
alma
in
a
scrape
it
was
the
custom
of
miss
leland
school
to
hold
the
examinations
before
the
christmas
holidays
early
in
december
so
that
the
teachers
and
the
girls
might
enjoy
their
holidays
without
the
shadow
of
that
depressing
necessity
hanging
over
them
and
so
that
they
might
apply
themselves
to
the
preparation
for
them
while
they
were
still
in
the
habit
of
studying
miss
leland
held
the
opinion
that
after
the
gay
indolence
of
the
holiday
season
and
when
the
girls
were
still
in
the
state
of
homesickness
and
lassitude
following
their
return
to
school
they
were
much
less
interested
in
making
good
marks
and
much
less
capable
of
applying
themselves
thus
the
first
week
of
a
snowy
december
found
the
entire
school
in
that
state
of
tension
which
seizes
any
body
of
young
people
when
a
hostile
body
of
older
people
is
bent
upon
finding
out
how
much
they
know
history
from
nine
to
twelve
groaned
charlotte
reread
the
whole
volume
i
crammed
dates
until
i
do
know
whether
columbus
discovered
america
in
or
i
with
free
silver
and
i
have
the
faintest
notion
what
the
trouble
was
about
a
long
long
time
ago
i
knew
whether
maryland
was
a
charter
colony
or
not
but
now
i
never
expect
to
know
again
i
could
write
everything
i
know
about
this
great
and
glorious
country
in
two
minutes
and
it
would
be
quite
wrong
at
that
and
the
thought
that
we
are
expected
to
know
enough
to
require
three
solid
hours
for
writing
it
out
is
driving
me
rapidly
into
a
state
of
chronic
melancholia
what
happened
in
charlotte
demanded
nancy
in
a
dazed
voice
something
happened
then
but
i
do
know
what
why
that
was
the
year
that
washington
said
the
alps
lies
italy
which
was
quite
true
and
even
if
he
did
say
it
then
it
would
have
been
true
so
you
ca
go
far
wrong
there
replied
charlotte
nancy
kindly
fold
up
your
book
i
am
going
to
flunk
and
i
wo
have
you
pass
if
you
try
to
study
any
more
i
going
to
sing
the
marseillaise
at
the
top
of
my
voice
i
think
i
stop
i
really
do
know
my
history
but
forgetting
it
the
more
i
try
to
study
after
dinner
that
night
the
was
empty
during
the
usual
hour
for
recreation
nearly
all
the
girls
having
gone
to
their
room
either
to
study
or
simply
as
a
matter
of
form
since
it
was
considered
highly
undiplomatic
to
say
the
least
to
appear
as
if
you
were
so
sure
of
the
outcome
of
your
examinations
that
you
felt
privileged
to
take
life
easily
what
they
did
once
they
were
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
rooms
was
of
course
strictly
their
own
business
two
or
three
who
believed
that
rest
was
essential
had
solemnly
gone
to
bed
a
dozen
or
even
more
of
the
seriously
inclined
had
hung
busy
signs
on
the
panel
of
their
doors
through
the
transoms
of
which
the
greenish
illumination
of
the
students
lamps
burning
within
told
their
own
story
the
others
philosophically
believing
that
if
they
were
going
to
pass
they
would
and
if
they
were
destined
to
flunk
they
would
do
so
in
spite
of
the
efforts
at
study
were
cheerfully
whiling
away
the
two
hours
of
grace
in
subdued
revelry
alma
who
had
every
reason
to
doubt
that
she
would
shine
in
her
examinations
unless
she
made
a
superhuman
effort
at
cramming
and
who
at
the
same
time
was
unable
to
comfort
herself
with
philosophical
indifference
was
curled
up
on
her
bed
her
fingers
in
her
ears
struggling
to
make
the
lines
she
read
convey
some
sense
to
her
weary
brain
i
say
milly
will
you
ask
me
some
questions
she
suggested
at
length
lifting
a
weary
face
from
her
book
i
do
know
i
know
oh
bother
do
study
any
more
what
does
it
matter
even
if
you
do
pass
said
mildred
for
goodness
sake
do
you
turn
into
a
grind
like
nancy
one
thing
i
refuse
to
do
is
to
room
with
anyone
who
studious
but
i
flunk
as
sure
as
fate
objected
alma
and
and
i
want
to
milly
you
a
bit
late
finding
that
out
it
not
going
to
do
you
a
bit
of
good
to
stuff
now
do
your
father
and
mother
mind
if
you
do
pass
oh
mother
does
care
a
bit
she
is
always
worrying
herself
to
death
for
fear
i
overstudying
dad
sometimes
rows
at
me
about
my
bad
marks
but
mother
always
takes
my
part
besides
this
is
my
last
year
of
school
and
what
earthly
good
will
latin
or
algebra
do
me
when
i
come
out
i
suppose
they
really
are
much
use
agreed
alma
finding
this
a
very
comforting
notion
of
course
it
different
with
nancy
she
wants
to
go
to
college
well
of
course
if
one
wants
to
be
a
school
teacher
said
mildred
with
a
very
faint
sneer
but
that
a
ridiculous
idea
for
anyone
who
as
pretty
as
you
are
alma
hesitated
she
felt
the
slight
cast
on
nancy
in
mildred
remark
but
she
was
afraid
to
resent
it
and
told
herself
that
she
would
not
be
justified
in
doing
so
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
wondering
why
she
liked
mildred
when
mildred
did
not
like
nancy
perhaps
she
was
unwilling
to
admit
this
supposition
but
it
formed
itself
hazily
in
her
mind
perhaps
she
herself
did
not
like
mildred
perhaps
way
down
inside
of
her
she
shared
her
sister
distrust
of
the
girl
but
why
did
she
admit
it
because
she
was
flattered
with
being
the
chosen
friend
of
the
most
important
girl
in
the
school
because
she
had
accepted
favors
from
mildred
she
blushed
involuntarily
as
these
thoughts
glided
through
her
mind
she
did
not
want
to
quarrel
with
mildred
even
when
she
knew
that
she
was
right
and
her
roommate
in
the
wrong
because
she
hoped
that
mildred
would
invite
her
to
visit
her
and
that
through
mildred
she
might
have
some
good
times
she
wished
that
mildred
would
make
mean
little
remarks
about
nancy
because
she
felt
ashamed
of
herself
for
not
openly
resenting
them
at
length
however
she
threw
aside
her
book
and
lent
her
rapt
attention
to
mildred
chatter
about
the
coming
holidays
in
a
little
while
other
girls
joined
them
and
the
next
hour
of
gossip
drove
away
her
uneasiness
for
the
coming
day
and
her
uncomfortable
reflections
the
last
examination
which
was
in
latin
ended
on
friday
at
noon
on
the
wednesday
of
the
following
week
the
reports
had
been
posted
on
the
and
at
the
eleven
recess
some
twenty
girls
were
clustered
around
them
struggling
to
get
near
enough
to
read
their
marks
those
who
were
closest
called
out
the
percentages
to
the
others
who
pelted
them
with
agitated
questions
you
got
in
french
denise
good
enough
good
heavens
nancy
prescott
you
made
in
history
and
charlotte
spencer
ye
gods
and
little
fishes
i
passed
my
algebra
catch
me
somebody
i
going
to
faint
kay
leonard
flunked
everything
but
her
french
whispered
another
well
it
wo
disturb
her
at
all
what
did
i
make
in
latin
good
for
you
drinkwater
does
make
anyone
a
present
of
her
marks
i
just
scraped
through
i
say
alma
alma
prescott
what
happened
to
you
on
your
latin
why
asked
alma
peering
over
allison
shoulder
and
turning
a
little
pale
did
did
i
flunk
very
badly
why
it
just
says
after
your
name
did
you
take
your
exam
of
course
i
took
it
well
there
you
can
see
for
yourself
it
just
has
a
queer
silence
fell
upon
the
chattering
group
of
girls
and
for
several
dreadful
moments
every
eye
was
turned
on
alma
who
white
as
a
sheet
was
staring
blankly
at
the
uncompromising
word
written
after
her
name
i
i
ca
understand
she
said
presently
in
a
scared
voice
i
take
the
examination
and
i
thought
i
really
got
through
i
ca
understand
why
should
it
be
cancelled
she
turned
her
big
frightened
eyes
to
nancy
who
as
pale
as
she
was
only
stared
back
at
her
why
should
my
examination
be
cancelled
repeated
alma
dazedly
was
anyone
else
cancelled
too
no
one
two
six
girls
flunked
and
for
goodness
mildred
lloyd
made
the
highest
mark
mildred
lloyd
come
here
and
get
your
medal
congratulations
mildred
strolled
up
nonchalantly
glanced
at
the
board
and
turned
away
only
nancy
followed
her
curiously
with
her
eyes
then
she
turned
to
alma
have
you
any
idea
why
your
examination
was
cancelled
she
asked
in
an
odd
voice
that
sounded
as
if
her
throat
was
dry
alma
shook
her
head
it
very
strange
come
and
let
ask
miss
drinkwater
maybe
only
that
your
paper
was
lost
or
something
like
that
she
tried
to
sound
comforting
but
she
had
no
faith
in
her
suggestion
just
then
however
the
bell
rang
and
the
girls
had
to
go
to
their
desks
miss
leland
took
her
place
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
stood
waiting
for
silence
everyone
felt
that
she
was
there
to
make
some
important
announcement
and
her
grave
cold
expression
led
all
of
them
to
suspect
that
it
was
not
an
entirely
pleasant
one
she
waited
a
moment
after
the
room
was
silent
alma
looked
piteously
at
nancy
with
a
glance
that
said
she
going
to
say
something
about
me
nancy
kept
her
eyes
fixedly
on
miss
leland
her
lips
were
pressed
together
tightly
and
her
hands
had
grown
as
cold
and
damp
as
though
she
had
just
taken
them
out
of
her
heart
was
beating
so
heavily
that
the
frill
on
her
trembled
miss
leland
took
a
step
forward
straightened
a
book
on
the
big
desk
and
then
looked
up
girls
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
this
school
i
am
compelled
to
make
an
announcement
that
is
as
great
a
humiliation
to
me
as
it
must
be
to
you
she
said
in
a
quiet
even
voice
ever
since
this
school
was
founded
there
has
never
until
now
been
any
occasion
when
i
have
been
forced
to
doubt
the
honor
of
one
of
my
pupils
she
made
another
pause
and
in
that
silence
an
electric
thrill
seemed
to
pass
through
each
one
of
the
girls
some
of
them
flushed
scarlet
and
others
went
white
as
though
each
one
felt
in
a
hazy
way
some
share
in
the
guilt
of
the
unnamed
culprit
for
the
first
time
in
eighteen
years
one
of
my
teachers
has
had
to
bring
to
my
attention
the
fact
that
a
pupil
of
this
school
attempted
to
in
an
examination
that
examination
has
of
course
been
cancelled
so
that
that
girl
attempt
to
win
a
high
mark
availed
her
nothing
i
do
not
need
i
am
sure
to
incite
in
you
feelings
of
disgust
and
shame
for
that
girl
action
your
own
sense
of
honor
makes
any
warnings
on
my
part
superfluous
and
insulting
to
you
fortunately
the
imposition
was
discovered
because
that
girl
most
unwisely
left
the
interlinear
translation
of
virgil
æneid
which
she
had
used
to
assist
her
in
the
examination
on
her
desk
where
it
was
found
and
brought
to
me
i
do
not
choose
to
announce
the
name
of
that
girl
much
as
she
merits
the
public
disgrace
i
shall
speak
to
her
privately
and
if
she
can
offer
which
is
not
likely
any
defense
of
her
action
i
may
soften
her
punishment
otherwise
i
have
no
choice
left
to
me
than
to
expel
her
from
a
school
which
she
has
disgraced
now
you
may
go
to
your
the
girls
rose
in
silence
and
hardly
knowing
what
they
were
doing
began
feverishly
to
collect
their
books
and
papers
but
neither
alma
nor
nancy
moved
in
a
few
moments
the
assembly
hall
was
empty
save
for
the
two
sisters
neither
of
whom
seemed
to
have
been
conscious
of
the
curious
glances
cast
at
them
by
the
other
girls
as
they
went
out
when
they
were
alone
nancy
got
up
and
went
over
to
alma
who
sat
as
if
she
had
been
turned
to
stone
with
a
face
as
white
as
chalk
alma
of
course
i
know
you
did
do
it
said
nancy
laying
her
hand
on
her
sister
and
speaking
in
a
gentle
trembling
voice
oh
nancy
it
so
horrible
it
so
horrible
moaned
alma
i
know
how
all
this
could
have
happened
what
shall
i
do
nancy
what
in
the
world
shall
i
do
come
dearest
let
go
coaxed
nancy
it
come
out
all
right
come
dear
of
course
now
everyone
knows
that
miss
leland
meant
me
said
alma
dully
am
i
going
to
be
expelled
nancy
i
ca
stand
it
i
stand
it
come
on
nancy
let
get
our
things
and
go
home
alma
darling
you
do
it
cried
nancy
the
very
shadow
of
such
a
doubt
making
her
feel
faint
and
alma
lifted
a
wan
face
and
smiled
i
do
that
i
did
do
it
she
said
drearily
if
they
found
a
trot
on
my
desk
and
it
must
have
been
my
desk
because
mine
was
the
only
examination
that
was
cancelled
why
how
can
i
prove
that
i
was
using
it
but
you
do
even
own
such
a
thing
you
would
dream
of
having
one
in
some
schools
girls
are
allowed
to
use
interlinear
translations
for
their
daily
work
but
it
not
permitted
here
and
it
would
have
entered
your
mind
to
get
one
come
we
go
to
miss
leland
at
once
she
alone
in
her
office
now
alma
let
herself
be
guided
up
to
the
principal
cosy
little
sanctum
where
miss
leland
was
seated
at
her
desk
writing
a
smoldered
with
friendly
warmth
on
the
brightly
burnished
andirons
and
a
clear
wintry
sunlight
fell
in
through
the
curtained
windows
where
a
perfect
garden
of
indoor
plants
bloomed
gaily
but
all
these
pleasant
homelike
things
seemed
to
share
the
chill
hostility
of
miss
level
glance
as
the
two
sisters
stood
looking
at
her
timidly
from
the
threshold
of
the
open
door
you
may
come
in
she
said
with
a
curt
nod
no
doubt
alma
you
wish
to
offer
some
explanation
be
seated
my
sister
wanted
to
say
that
there
was
a
mistake
the
book
you
referred
to
was
never
in
her
possession
and
she
did
not
use
it
at
her
examination
said
nancy
speaking
rapidly
and
almost
harshly
in
her
endeavor
to
keep
from
breaking
into
a
fit
of
hysterical
tears
alma
was
quite
incapable
of
saying
a
word
for
herself
then
i
am
sorry
that
it
happened
to
be
found
on
her
desk
just
after
she
had
left
the
replied
miss
leland
dryly
her
tone
expressing
her
complete
lack
of
belief
in
nancy
words
alma
did
you
have
that
book
asked
nancy
turning
sharply
to
her
sister
miss
leland
opened
a
drawer
of
her
and
took
out
a
small
volume
bound
in
green
cloth
which
she
handed
over
to
alma
alma
had
already
opened
her
lips
to
utter
a
frantic
denial
to
question
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
book
she
shut
her
mouth
with
a
sudden
gasp
and
without
taking
it
simply
stared
at
the
inoffensive
little
volume
with
a
fixed
horrified
gaze
is
that
an
interlinear
she
exclaimed
breathlessly
is
that
the
book
that
was
found
on
my
desk
so
you
seen
it
before
remarked
miss
leland
alma
this
is
a
very
serious
matter
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
a
girl
making
use
of
any
whatever
at
an
examination
a
failure
is
to
be
deplored
but
it
is
not
a
disgrace
and
it
is
to
be
very
much
regretted
that
you
did
not
choose
rather
to
run
the
risk
of
an
honorable
failure
than
to
attempt
to
steal
a
good
mark
i
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
had
to
speak
of
it
before
the
school
but
i
had
to
make
a
public
example
of
the
girl
who
could
stoop
to
such
an
act
you
understand
of
course
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
continue
as
a
pupil
in
this
school
for
some
reason
alma
had
grown
quite
calm
and
when
miss
leland
had
finished
speaking
instead
of
appearing
to
be
overcome
by
the
grim
meaning
in
the
last
words
she
rose
quietly
of
course
if
you
can
not
take
my
word
for
it
that
i
never
looked
inside
that
book
or
anything
like
it
in
my
whole
life
why
there
is
no
use
in
my
saying
anything
more
she
said
with
the
utmost
i
do
know
how
it
came
to
be
on
my
desk
alma
i
am
anxious
to
believe
a
girl
is
innocent
until
she
is
proved
guilty
said
miss
leland
impressed
by
alma
coolness
only
you
seen
this
volume
before
she
looked
at
the
girl
with
a
still
doubtful
and
puzzled
expression
alma
hesitated
a
moment
before
she
admitted
slowly
yes
i
have
seen
it
miss
leland
but
i
never
knew
what
it
was
you
have
seen
it
in
the
possession
of
some
girl
in
this
school
that
i
ca
answer
replied
alma
with
a
firmness
that
nancy
had
never
seen
in
her
before
i
i
do
think
you
have
a
right
to
ask
me
any
more
questions
miss
leland
if
if
you
just
let
the
whole
business
go
i
perfectly
willing
to
to
bear
the
blame
please
ask
me
any
more
questions
let
it
be
as
it
is
just
as
long
as
nancy
is
satisfied
that
i
never
did
that
hateful
thing
why
i
do
mind
you
know
the
two
sisters
looked
at
each
other
happily
each
of
them
sincerely
indifferent
as
to
whether
anyone
else
in
the
school
believed
alma
innocent
or
guilty
come
on
nancy
said
alma
almost
gaily
they
had
started
to
leave
the
room
when
miss
leland
called
them
back
i
am
very
anxious
to
believe
in
you
alma
if
there
has
been
a
mistake
be
assured
that
it
will
be
set
right
i
will
tell
the
other
girls
at
luncheon
that
well
i
must
see
i
am
in
a
difficult
position
you
may
both
go
now
i
would
advise
you
to
go
directly
to
your
classes
nancy
was
curiously
as
they
made
their
way
hand
in
hand
then
all
at
once
she
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
catching
her
under
lip
between
her
teeth
on
the
bottom
step
she
stopped
short
and
putting
her
hands
on
alma
shoulder
swung
her
about
so
that
she
could
look
into
her
eyes
her
own
were
very
bright
what
is
it
asked
alma
then
for
some
reason
she
colored
and
turned
her
eyes
away
i
know
now
where
i
saw
that
book
myself
alma
said
nancy
nancy
alma
blue
eyes
now
suddenly
filled
with
tears
oh
nancy
you
wo
say
anything
no
no
you
did
see
it
please
do
believe
that
of
her
two
sundays
ago
when
i
was
talking
to
you
i
noticed
it
in
the
bookcase
in
your
room
i
kept
reading
the
titles
on
the
books
when
i
you
know
the
way
you
do
when
you
worried
it
stood
between
a
copy
of
commonwealth
and
a
french
grammar
nancy
you
must
say
anything
do
you
hear
insisted
alma
beseechingly
i
wo
say
anything
but
but
i
going
to
you
go
on
to
class
i
tell
you
i
wo
say
anything
oh
alma
you
darling
go
on
to
class
i
say
nancy
what
are
you
going
to
do
demanded
alma
as
nancy
broke
away
from
her
and
ran
up
the
stairs
again
you
are
going
to
miss
leland
no
i
not
there
is
that
the
postman
you
might
as
well
see
if
there
anything
for
us
before
you
go
to
french
alma
walked
down
the
hall
toward
the
front
door
where
the
maid
was
taking
the
noon
mail
from
the
postman
nancy
stood
waiting
up
the
stairs
evidently
lost
in
thoughts
which
were
not
very
pleasant
for
her
brown
eyes
sparkled
with
suppressed
indignation
and
contempt
and
once
or
twice
she
pressed
her
lips
together
tightly
as
she
always
did
when
she
was
trying
to
make
herself
look
calmer
than
she
felt
here
a
letter
from
mother
said
alma
coming
back
with
an
envelope
in
her
hand
i
ca
read
it
now
so
you
take
it
and
save
it
for
me
nancy
leaned
over
and
took
it
from
her
i
i
may
not
see
you
until
she
said
slipping
the
letter
into
the
pocket
of
her
skirt
you
know
you
can
trust
me
to
hold
my
tongue
well
quite
as
well
as
she
can
and
she
holds
hers
very
well
indeed
do
you
mind
being
stared
at
and
whispered
about
alma
only
smiled
then
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
made
a
right
about
face
marched
off
chin
up
to
brave
the
battery
of
glancing
eyes
and
whispering
tongues
alone
chapter
xiii
nancy
has
a
great
adventure
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
in
nancy
mind
that
it
was
mildred
who
had
cheated
in
the
examination
but
whether
mildred
had
deliberately
left
the
book
on
alma
desk
or
whether
she
had
simply
forgotten
it
she
did
not
know
the
fact
remained
however
that
so
far
mildred
had
made
no
effort
to
clear
alma
of
the
suspicion
and
knowing
mildred
nature
as
she
did
nancy
was
not
inclined
to
think
that
mildred
would
ever
do
so
of
her
own
accord
nancy
was
willing
to
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
so
far
as
believing
that
she
had
not
intentionally
thrown
alma
into
such
a
damaging
position
in
the
first
place
she
had
no
motive
for
injuring
alma
and
in
the
second
place
she
ran
a
very
great
risk
of
discovery
herself
leaving
the
whys
and
wherefores
nancy
regarded
the
simple
fact
that
having
thus
injured
alma
mildred
was
not
going
to
try
to
clear
her
and
pay
the
penalty
herself
the
thought
that
most
wounded
nancy
was
that
alma
was
under
obligations
to
the
girl
who
had
treated
her
so
badly
the
handsome
fur
mildred
had
lent
her
was
not
yet
paid
for
and
nancy
shrank
from
the
idea
of
her
sister
owing
money
to
her
she
had
of
course
not
mentioned
this
to
alma
although
it
had
been
the
first
thought
that
sprang
into
her
own
head
when
she
first
became
certain
that
mildred
was
the
culprit
it
would
have
troubled
alma
who
was
already
troubled
enough
and
she
could
have
done
nothing
about
it
i
got
to
get
that
money
somehow
nancy
said
to
herself
grimly
i
can
write
to
mother
for
part
of
it
about
half
perhaps
but
the
other
half
i
got
to
get
myself
naturally
her
first
idea
was
to
pocket
her
pride
and
to
ask
her
uncle
thomas
for
the
money
not
even
that
would
hurt
her
so
much
as
the
thought
of
owing
it
to
mildred
but
then
she
dismissed
this
plan
from
her
mind
it
was
impossible
it
would
be
a
breach
of
their
terms
of
friendship
for
one
thing
and
for
another
she
felt
that
to
explain
to
him
her
reasons
for
wanting
it
would
be
unjust
to
alma
while
she
was
turning
one
plan
after
another
over
in
her
mind
she
absently
took
her
mother
letter
from
her
pocket
and
slit
the
envelope
open
with
a
hairpin
she
glanced
almost
carelessly
at
the
lines
written
in
prescott
pointed
flourishing
hand
then
all
at
once
the
meaning
of
the
first
sentence
fixed
her
wandering
attention
my
darling
darling
little
daughters
i
can
hardly
bring
myself
to
write
this
letter
you
do
know
how
hard
it
is
for
me
but
i
deserve
the
pain
and
humiliation
i
am
a
very
foolish
woman
but
oh
my
dears
i
have
made
my
mistakes
only
in
trying
to
help
you
both
and
now
what
i
done
to
you
there
was
no
one
to
advise
me
and
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
business
but
it
seemed
so
perfectly
practical
so
absolutely
all
this
was
perfect
greek
to
nancy
and
she
saw
that
her
poor
mother
had
evidently
written
the
letter
in
an
almost
desperate
state
of
mind
after
two
pages
of
it
was
gradually
made
clear
to
nancy
that
prescott
had
made
an
unfortunate
investment
of
her
little
capital
though
the
extent
of
the
loss
prescott
did
not
explain
in
an
effort
to
increase
their
meagre
income
she
had
taken
all
her
money
or
part
of
it
and
bought
stock
in
some
oil
interest
in
texas
a
western
promoter
had
assured
her
that
it
was
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
he
himself
being
either
an
unconscionable
fraud
or
a
optimist
nancy
had
not
the
remotest
idea
when
her
mother
had
made
the
investment
but
evidently
the
news
of
its
complete
failure
had
just
reached
her
and
it
was
equally
evident
that
it
had
been
a
total
loss
utter
bewilderment
confused
nancy
thoughts
so
that
at
first
she
could
hardly
realize
all
that
the
misfortune
might
mean
she
felt
no
terror
only
a
wave
of
pity
and
tenderness
for
her
mother
whose
misery
was
so
pitifully
expressed
in
the
letter
then
she
thought
of
alma
misfortune
of
that
kind
would
hit
both
of
them
harder
than
herself
because
they
had
a
greater
need
for
luxury
and
pleasure
than
she
there
was
nothing
terrible
to
her
in
the
thought
of
work
and
of
difficulties
to
be
overcome
because
in
her
quiet
way
she
had
a
great
wealth
of
the
ardent
ambition
of
youth
and
that
zest
for
struggle
which
is
characteristic
of
strong
natures
alma
and
her
mother
on
the
other
hand
saw
nothing
but
the
wretchedness
of
thwarted
hopes
in
such
an
existence
of
poverty
and
work
they
were
created
for
ease
and
luxury
just
as
the
hollyhock
is
made
to
bloom
against
the
sunny
garden
wall
poor
prescott
who
had
dreamed
such
happy
fairy
tales
for
her
daughters
and
who
with
her
own
hands
as
it
were
had
so
innocently
destroyed
the
little
they
possessed
and
alma
so
thirsty
for
pleasure
and
beauty
it
was
only
on
their
account
that
nancy
suffered
she
understood
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
herself
and
alma
to
come
back
to
school
for
the
next
term
but
that
would
have
been
impossible
anyway
nancy
thought
even
with
alma
cleared
of
the
dreadful
suspicion
that
rested
on
her
for
nancy
stiff
pride
could
not
brook
the
thought
of
living
among
people
who
had
doubted
her
sister
even
though
the
circumstantial
evidence
against
alma
had
been
very
strong
however
shall
i
get
all
the
money
to
pay
alma
debt
now
she
thought
dazedly
i
ca
get
even
half
of
it
from
mother
because
she
would
certainly
deny
herself
the
very
necessities
of
life
to
send
it
i
ask
uncle
thomas
for
it
she
knew
that
in
all
probability
she
could
influence
prescott
through
his
increasing
affection
for
her
to
help
her
mother
out
of
their
present
difficulty
but
the
thought
of
doing
so
was
utterly
repugnant
to
her
and
it
seemed
to
her
intolerably
humiliating
both
for
prescott
and
alma
she
was
afraid
that
prescott
learning
that
uncle
thomas
had
shown
a
favoritism
for
her
might
urge
her
to
this
course
and
she
could
not
decide
whether
she
should
swallow
her
pride
for
her
mother
sake
and
for
alma
or
whether
she
should
insist
that
they
fight
their
way
courageously
out
of
the
difficulty
so
far
as
she
herself
was
concerned
there
would
have
been
no
question
there
was
nothing
that
she
would
not
endure
rather
than
ask
her
uncle
for
a
cent
her
hands
were
trembling
as
she
folded
the
letter
up
and
put
it
in
her
bureau
drawer
under
her
handkerchief
case
how
am
i
going
to
tell
alma
well
she
would
break
the
news
first
of
all
she
must
solve
the
problem
of
the
debt
to
mildred
only
one
course
was
possible
there
was
her
father
ring
which
she
always
kept
and
which
was
her
very
dearest
possession
it
was
of
the
heaviest
gold
and
set
with
a
large
seal
stone
of
she
might
raise
perhaps
or
forty
dollars
on
it
which
left
about
seventy
still
to
be
found
by
hook
or
crook
never
had
any
sum
appeared
so
gigantic
to
nancy
she
could
see
no
other
possible
means
of
getting
it
than
by
borrowing
it
temporarily
from
charlotte
and
paying
it
back
by
one
way
or
another
during
the
holidays
she
knew
that
charlotte
would
be
glad
to
lend
it
to
her
but
she
shrank
from
the
thought
of
putting
their
friendship
to
such
a
use
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
in
alma
pocketbook
she
found
enough
money
to
pay
her
way
into
the
city
her
mother
would
certainly
be
sending
them
a
little
more
in
a
day
or
two
for
their
return
home
she
took
the
money
two
or
three
dollars
left
from
the
ten
which
alma
had
borrowed
from
her
and
began
to
change
into
her
suit
thinking
meanwhile
with
a
smile
of
incredulity
of
the
imprudence
of
sending
herself
and
alma
to
one
of
the
very
schools
where
their
poverty
would
be
contrasted
with
the
abundance
of
mildred
lloyds
and
katherine
leonards
when
she
was
ready
for
town
she
went
to
miss
leland
office
and
told
her
simply
that
she
had
just
received
a
letter
from
her
mother
which
made
it
necessary
to
go
to
the
city
without
delay
miss
leland
gave
the
consent
which
nancy
in
her
excited
state
of
mind
was
ready
to
go
with
or
without
she
caught
the
next
train
to
new
york
and
by
was
in
the
grand
central
station
wondering
where
on
earth
now
that
she
was
there
she
would
be
able
to
get
the
money
on
the
ring
she
had
a
vague
idea
that
the
only
possible
place
would
be
some
and
she
had
read
in
nicholas
nickleby
that
one
can
tell
a
by
three
golden
balls
hanging
in
front
of
it
and
also
that
one
would
be
likely
to
find
it
only
in
a
squalid
section
of
the
business
district
the
dealer
would
certainly
be
jewish
and
he
would
in
all
probability
not
give
her
a
tenth
of
what
the
ring
was
worth
none
of
these
thoughts
were
likely
to
raise
her
spirits
at
all
and
when
at
length
she
found
herself
outside
a
dirty
little
shop
on
lower
sixth
avenue
gazing
in
upon
a
window
display
of
dusty
violins
and
guitars
travelling
bags
and
tawdry
jewelry
while
above
her
the
traditional
golden
balls
creaked
in
a
sharp
wind
her
courage
all
but
failed
her
she
was
frankly
terrified
by
the
sordid
strangeness
of
her
environment
by
the
dirty
sodden
loafers
that
shuffled
past
her
and
by
the
thought
of
haggling
for
money
over
the
counter
of
that
dingy
and
even
little
shop
at
length
however
she
plucked
up
courage
and
with
her
heart
in
her
throat
entered
the
front
part
of
the
shop
was
empty
and
very
dark
at
the
back
was
a
swinging
door
leading
into
another
room
from
which
issued
the
sound
of
voices
of
two
men
the
little
bell
over
the
front
door
had
rung
as
nancy
entered
to
apprise
the
shopkeeper
of
a
customer
and
under
the
swinging
door
she
saw
a
pair
of
shuffling
feet
moving
toward
it
the
shopkeeper
emerged
followed
by
the
other
man
who
was
evidently
a
customer
come
to
make
a
purchase
of
some
antique
piece
for
the
pawnbroker
seemed
to
deal
in
old
and
what
not
besides
his
regular
historic
business
of
i
vill
gif
you
dat
box
for
vun
hundert
dollars
mit
dat
it
iss
a
gift
the
shopkeeper
was
saying
doggedly
as
he
came
toward
nancy
and
the
other
man
following
him
laughed
well
you
certainly
give
awfully
expensive
presents
he
remarked
a
hundred
dollars
you
old
rascal
no
one
on
earth
would
give
that
for
a
little
box
vell
only
try
to
duplicate
it
you
vill
not
find
such
a
handsome
piece
dis
side
de
ocean
returned
the
shopkeeper
with
a
shrug
vot
can
i
do
for
you
young
lady
but
nancy
had
temporarily
lost
all
power
of
speech
she
was
not
sure
indeed
that
she
was
dreaming
it
was
all
so
utterly
strange
and
whimsical
and
impossible
that
surely
it
could
be
so
only
in
a
dream
for
the
young
man
who
had
followed
the
pawnbroker
out
of
the
inner
room
was
george
arnold
she
was
standing
with
her
back
to
the
door
but
the
light
that
came
through
the
dirty
glass
shone
squarely
on
his
face
so
that
if
she
had
not
already
recognized
his
voice
she
would
have
recognized
his
features
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
her
first
impulse
was
to
turn
and
fly
or
to
conceal
herself
hastily
in
one
of
the
odd
little
sentry
boxes
which
were
evidently
designed
to
preserve
the
incognito
of
the
pawnbroker
indigent
customers
but
already
arnold
had
cast
a
second
curious
glance
at
the
unusual
sight
of
a
young
girl
in
such
surroundings
and
with
that
second
glance
he
had
recognized
her
his
mouth
opened
slightly
in
a
repressed
gasp
of
astonishment
probably
with
a
moment
thought
he
might
have
pretended
that
he
had
not
recognized
her
in
order
to
spare
her
any
embarrassment
but
he
had
already
exclaimed
involuntarily
why
miss
prescott
and
had
taken
a
step
toward
her
nancy
turned
scarlet
and
could
only
gaze
at
him
helplessly
how
can
i
serve
you
young
lady
repeated
the
shopkeeper
nancy
hesitated
in
a
perfect
agony
of
embarrassment
while
arnold
continued
to
look
at
her
evidently
very
much
at
a
loss
on
the
one
hand
he
disliked
to
discomfit
her
by
being
present
while
she
transacted
her
business
with
old
zeigler
the
pawnbroker
and
on
the
other
he
was
equally
unwilling
to
leave
her
to
be
swindled
as
she
very
probably
would
be
furthermore
while
he
realized
that
he
had
no
business
to
inquire
into
her
affairs
and
that
to
say
the
least
it
would
be
the
height
of
bad
taste
to
do
so
nevertheless
he
felt
that
she
was
in
some
difficulty
and
needed
advice
the
squalid
little
shop
was
an
odd
place
in
which
to
find
the
niece
of
old
thomas
prescott
for
it
was
not
likely
that
she
had
come
there
as
he
had
to
browse
around
in
a
dilettante
search
for
curios
nancy
read
the
question
what
are
you
here
for
in
his
face
and
guessed
his
indecision
on
her
part
she
wished
fervently
that
he
would
go
and
was
racking
her
brains
for
some
excuse
to
leave
the
shop
and
to
come
back
later
but
her
frantic
efforts
at
evolving
some
plan
of
escape
within
the
space
of
fifteen
seconds
were
fruitless
zeigler
for
the
third
time
repeated
his
question
to
her
with
a
touch
of
impatience
then
arnold
desperately
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
with
a
touch
of
pretended
gaiety
asked
with
a
laugh
are
you
in
search
of
adventure
you
are
running
away
from
school
are
you
no
that
is
stammered
nancy
then
driven
to
take
him
into
her
confidence
to
some
extent
and
trying
to
put
her
situation
in
the
light
of
a
prank
she
laughed
mischievously
and
added
with
an
air
of
candor
you
caught
me
what
are
you
up
to
young
lady
selling
the
family
plate
inquired
arnold
boldly
and
speaking
to
her
as
if
she
were
a
mischievous
youngster
though
his
eyes
were
grave
and
puzzled
nancy
put
up
her
chin
as
if
she
were
being
scolded
and
answered
with
a
touch
of
childish
defiance
do
tell
on
me
well
i
wo
though
you
deserve
it
replied
arnold
i
wo
on
one
condition
that
you
come
with
me
and
up
to
all
your
misdemeanors
and
let
me
give
you
the
sage
advice
of
a
hardened
sinner
before
you
do
anything
rash
i
realize
that
i
taking
a
liberty
miss
prescott
in
concerning
myself
in
what
is
strictly
your
own
affair
he
added
seriously
but
is
our
friendship
firmly
enough
established
to
allow
me
that
privilege
what
time
is
it
he
glanced
at
his
watch
ten
minutes
past
two
and
i
had
no
luncheon
have
you
nancy
admitted
that
she
had
good
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
how
awfully
lucky
i
consider
myself
in
having
met
you
miss
prescott
i
wish
you
would
come
with
me
to
some
nice
little
restaurant
where
we
can
decide
the
affairs
of
the
nations
are
you
in
a
great
hurry
nancy
said
that
she
was
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
very
glad
that
arnold
concerned
himself
in
her
affairs
which
she
had
begun
to
believe
she
was
not
managing
any
too
well
they
had
talked
in
low
voices
so
that
the
shopkeeper
could
only
have
heard
fragments
of
their
conversation
and
then
left
the
shop
without
even
a
word
of
explanation
to
the
irritated
old
arnold
hailed
a
and
they
rolled
off
in
state
arnold
had
given
the
driver
the
address
of
a
little
french
restaurant
on
west
street
it
be
fairly
empty
now
and
we
can
find
just
the
table
we
want
shall
order
your
luncheon
for
you
because
i
know
just
exactly
what
things
are
peculiar
to
this
place
their
special
and
i
feel
like
ordering
a
regular
of
a
feast
as
a
sort
of
celebration
really
you
no
idea
how
delighted
i
am
to
have
discovered
you
his
frank
boyish
pleasure
in
this
freak
of
chance
was
so
plainly
written
on
his
beaming
face
that
nancy
colored
with
a
schoolgirl
naïve
delight
in
such
sincere
flattery
the
dreaded
undertaking
of
her
trip
to
the
city
was
turning
into
a
very
charming
little
surprise
party
in
some
way
she
felt
that
she
had
known
arnold
for
a
very
long
time
and
that
really
there
was
not
the
slightest
need
for
concealing
anything
from
him
his
odd
attractive
face
was
so
friendly
his
bright
brown
eyes
so
full
of
eager
sympathetic
interest
that
almost
before
she
had
given
a
second
thought
as
to
whether
she
should
or
she
should
she
had
begun
to
tell
him
the
reason
for
her
appearance
at
the
pawnbroker
they
had
found
a
little
table
in
a
corner
of
the
restaurant
and
arnold
had
insisted
upon
ordering
almost
everything
on
the
menu
that
attracted
his
fancy
and
above
all
things
you
must
try
the
hot
chocolate
miss
prescott
i
suppose
it
not
manly
but
i
have
the
most
juvenile
fondness
for
hot
chocolate
with
great
big
blobs
of
whipped
cream
so
hot
chocolate
they
had
and
innumerable
rolls
hot
and
fresh
from
the
oven
and
various
and
sundry
other
delicacies
calculated
to
cripple
a
weak
digestion
for
a
month
at
the
very
least
drawn
out
by
her
growing
confidence
in
him
and
by
her
craving
to
talk
out
her
troubles
to
some
one
whose
advice
would
be
sound
and
based
on
genuine
sympathy
nancy
told
him
about
her
necessity
for
getting
some
money
the
explanation
involved
a
good
many
complications
and
nancy
was
as
a
rule
unusually
reserved
but
arnold
was
one
of
those
rather
rare
people
who
can
understand
a
great
deal
more
than
is
said
in
just
so
many
words
and
she
did
not
have
to
go
into
details
as
to
why
for
example
she
hesitated
to
ask
her
uncle
for
the
money
or
why
it
was
impossible
to
write
to
her
mother
for
it
she
told
him
simply
that
there
was
a
girl
at
school
to
whom
her
sister
was
indebted
and
who
had
played
alma
a
very
shabby
trick
and
that
therefore
she
felt
that
it
was
absolutely
imperative
to
clear
alma
of
the
obligation
to
her
he
listened
attentively
interposing
occasionally
in
the
friendly
tone
such
as
an
older
man
might
use
to
a
young
one
so
that
she
felt
no
embarrassment
in
making
the
whole
affair
clear
to
him
nor
did
he
seem
to
think
that
there
was
anything
very
awful
in
her
trying
to
raise
the
money
for
herself
with
the
ring
as
a
security
only
you
should
have
gotten
someone
advice
miss
prescott
a
man
like
zeigler
would
swindle
you
outrageously
and
there
are
plenty
of
reputable
places
which
make
loans
on
jewelry
as
a
security
how
large
is
the
debt
nancy
told
him
a
hundred
and
ten
dollars
you
are
unwilling
to
ask
your
uncle
then
seeing
a
look
of
distress
in
her
face
he
went
on
hastily
well
i
think
i
can
understand
i
admire
your
independence
miss
prescott
i
say
he
asked
suddenly
with
a
touch
of
shyness
would
you
mind
if
i
should
call
you
nancy
it
sounds
so
much
more
friendly
i
like
you
to
replied
nancy
simply
it
makes
me
feel
sort
of
old
to
be
called
miss
prescott
very
well
and
it
makes
me
feel
quite
antique
to
be
called
arnold
i
wish
you
flatter
me
into
believing
myself
young
once
more
by
calling
me
george
oh
goodness
i
do
believe
i
could
i
i
mean
that
sounds
so
dreadfully
cheeky
exclaimed
nancy
i
suppose
i
must
seem
actually
prehistoric
to
you
he
said
with
a
laugh
that
sounded
just
a
little
bit
forced
but
if
you
practised
a
bit
you
probably
find
that
it
would
get
easier
for
you
and
it
would
please
me
very
much
to
return
to
business
i
think
that
if
you
will
let
me
have
the
ring
i
can
get
the
money
on
it
for
you
this
afternoon
i
know
the
best
place
to
go
where
you
will
get
something
really
proportionate
to
its
value
and
on
the
best
terms
nancy
could
have
hugged
him
in
her
relief
and
gratitude
she
protested
a
little
feebly
against
his
putting
himself
to
any
trouble
but
he
waved
her
words
aside
and
she
took
the
ring
from
her
bag
and
gave
it
to
him
he
looked
at
it
curiously
inside
the
broad
finger
band
was
inscribed
in
characters
almost
obliterated
by
wear
the
words
to
george
on
his
birthday
it
was
father
uncle
thomas
gave
it
to
him
explained
nancy
simply
and
at
the
same
moment
both
of
them
were
thinking
of
the
eccentric
old
gentleman
whose
gift
to
a
beloved
nephew
was
now
being
used
to
assist
that
nephew
daughter
in
a
difficulty
in
which
help
was
denied
her
now
how
would
you
like
to
spend
your
time
for
of
an
hour
or
so
asked
arnold
as
they
walked
out
of
the
restaurant
i
am
going
off
with
this
ring
and
i
be
back
with
the
money
as
soon
as
i
possibly
can
you
pick
some
place
for
me
to
meet
you
nancy
glanced
up
and
down
the
street
trying
to
find
some
spot
where
she
could
amuse
herself
i
think
i
like
to
look
around
some
is
there
one
near
here
i
an
authority
on
the
subject
i
know
every
in
new
york
and
if
you
follow
me
i
show
you
my
favorite
haunt
then
i
can
be
sure
that
you
wo
wander
away
my
only
trouble
will
be
in
getting
you
out
of
the
place
and
if
i
were
wise
i
would
let
you
go
there
under
any
circumstances
but
my
generosity
was
always
very
much
greater
than
my
wisdom
he
conducted
nancy
accordingly
to
this
paradise
and
rather
lingeringly
withdrew
on
his
errand
leaving
her
in
the
quaint
little
shop
where
perfect
tidal
waves
of
books
rose
on
all
sides
of
her
distracting
her
with
alluring
familiar
titles
with
the
sight
of
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
rare
old
volumes
and
with
that
peculiar
smell
of
leather
and
paper
and
ink
and
mustiness
which
is
to
the
nostrils
of
the
as
the
scent
of
earth
and
trees
is
to
the
wanderer
on
one
of
the
shelves
her
eyes
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
name
on
the
back
of
three
or
four
delicately
bound
volumes
and
she
quickly
took
one
of
them
down
to
inspect
it
suddenly
remembering
her
uncle
remark
about
that
the
name
on
the
back
of
the
book
was
george
arnold
it
was
a
volume
of
stories
finely
bound
and
illustrated
with
pen
drawings
by
a
very
famous
artist
and
designer
and
was
prefaced
by
a
foreword
from
the
pen
of
one
of
the
most
celebrated
of
the
english
critics
nancy
promptly
climbed
up
on
a
high
stool
that
stood
near
the
shelf
and
with
her
heels
hooked
on
the
second
rung
and
the
book
spread
open
on
her
lap
began
to
read
she
had
time
to
glance
only
here
and
there
and
it
was
with
surprise
and
pleasure
that
she
saw
a
sentence
in
the
preface
which
spoke
of
the
writings
of
arnold
as
being
an
example
of
the
most
delicate
artistry
a
talent
so
rare
so
peculiarly
sensitive
so
rich
in
a
wholly
inimitable
poetry
and
waywardness
of
fancy
that
one
hardly
hesitates
to
pronounce
it
actual
genius
and
it
was
this
genius
this
prophet
in
his
own
country
who
at
the
present
moment
was
hurrying
off
in
service
nancy
felt
a
positive
thrill
of
dismay
mingled
with
something
else
that
was
wholly
pleasant
and
exciting
but
how
in
the
world
could
she
ever
call
him
george
imagine
calling
a
famous
writer
by
his
first
name
it
seemed
impertinent
to
say
the
least
to
tell
the
truth
she
spent
a
good
deal
more
of
her
time
thinking
about
this
simple
friendly
gentleman
than
in
browsing
over
the
which
under
ordinary
circumstance
would
have
been
so
fascinating
to
her
why
was
he
so
very
nice
to
insignificant
her
how
could
she
possibly
be
interesting
to
a
man
who
had
probably
been
intimate
with
many
of
the
most
celebrated
men
and
women
of
the
day
but
of
course
it
was
very
likely
that
he
was
particularly
interested
in
her
and
was
only
that
he
had
a
generous
disposition
he
was
ever
so
much
older
than
she
was
anyway
and
probably
he
thought
she
was
a
nice
child
she
was
pondering
thus
the
book
still
open
on
her
lap
and
her
back
to
the
door
when
he
returned
flushed
with
satisfaction
and
also
with
haste
i
say
i
done
a
marvellous
stroke
of
business
he
announced
as
he
came
up
behind
her
you
seem
to
have
found
a
very
absorbing
book
nancy
are
you
at
all
interested
in
learning
what
my
amazing
talent
for
high
finance
has
accomplished
i
ca
tell
you
how
good
you
have
been
to
me
began
nancy
gratefully
and
shyly
i
have
been
good
to
you
a
bit
it
you
who
have
been
good
to
me
help
you
he
said
smiling
down
into
her
eyes
i
take
it
as
a
very
high
compliment
that
you
were
frank
enough
with
me
to
tell
me
how
i
could
serve
you
because
there
is
nothing
you
know
that
i
would
rather
do
that
sounds
rather
flowery
does
it
but
it
quite
true
now
listen
i
have
brought
you
the
sum
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
american
dollars
that
more
than
you
expected
to
get
on
the
ring
is
it
a
hundred
and
fifty
here
it
is
in
beautiful
clean
notes
i
explain
it
all
to
you
presently
did
you
find
anything
nice
what
book
have
you
got
there
he
glanced
at
the
volume
she
held
and
seeing
what
it
was
laughed
and
took
it
away
from
her
how
did
you
ever
find
he
asked
in
a
deprecating
voice
though
at
that
genuinely
modest
as
he
was
he
was
not
i
thought
you
would
have
found
something
better
i
not
posing
as
the
modest
author
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
there
are
some
wonderful
books
in
here
that
you
should
have
missed
i
i
did
know
you
were
i
mean
you
mean
you
did
know
that
i
was
all
that
that
critic
chap
says
i
am
well
i
not
he
just
gotten
into
the
amiable
habit
of
saying
kind
things
in
his
old
age
so
that
he
can
get
into
heaven
when
he
dies
in
spite
of
all
the
damage
he
did
in
his
youth
come
along
unless
you
want
to
look
about
you
some
more
i
be
ready
in
a
moment
said
nancy
slipping
off
the
stool
i
there
something
being
wrapped
for
me
that
i
want
to
get
with
that
she
went
off
to
the
back
of
the
store
and
had
the
little
volume
tied
up
and
paid
for
it
with
the
last
cent
in
her
pocketbook
then
she
returned
all
right
now
here
is
your
money
he
took
a
fat
envelope
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
her
and
they
left
the
shop
as
they
walked
across
to
fifth
avenue
he
explained
to
her
rather
vaguely
the
proceeding
by
which
he
had
raised
the
money
for
her
but
while
she
quite
failed
to
understand
it
all
she
rested
upon
her
faith
in
his
superior
intelligence
in
business
matters
when
i
want
to
get
the
ring
back
again
what
do
i
do
and
do
i
have
to
pay
interest
oh
no
you
do
have
to
pay
interest
that
the
wonderful
part
of
it
and
when
you
want
it
back
you
just
tell
me
i
have
to
get
it
for
you
but
you
wo
mind
that
will
you
oh
no
oh
you
been
so
kind
arnold
i
mean
only
you
wo
say
anything
to
uncle
thomas
of
course
you
wo
but
i
just
mentioning
that
i
wo
breathe
a
word
to
any
living
thing
on
land
or
sea
this
is
our
own
private
conspiracy
and
no
one
shall
have
any
part
in
it
he
assured
her
gaily
only
please
promise
me
that
if
you
should
need
any
help
again
you
ask
me
i
it
disturbed
me
very
much
to
find
you
at
old
zeigler
though
of
course
it
was
my
good
fortune
there
was
an
abundance
of
time
before
nancy
train
left
so
they
strolled
at
an
easy
pace
down
fifth
avenue
stopping
to
look
in
at
the
shop
windows
whenever
they
saw
anything
that
caught
their
fancy
and
chatting
together
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
all
their
lives
at
the
corner
of
street
arnold
suddenly
dove
into
a
huge
florist
shop
on
the
corner
and
in
a
moment
returned
bearing
a
bunch
of
parma
violets
tied
with
a
silken
cord
and
tassel
i
say
will
you
wear
these
he
asked
bluntly
you
know
i
always
wanted
to
give
a
bouquet
to
a
young
lady
but
i
never
could
find
the
young
lady
to
whom
i
wanted
to
give
them
the
flowers
were
plentiful
but
i
began
to
think
that
the
lady
did
exist
nancy
colored
at
the
compliment
with
which
he
proffered
her
the
flowers
and
dimpled
as
only
a
rosy
girl
can
dimple
his
attentions
were
very
flattering
and
his
boyish
manner
made
them
doubly
so
now
do
tell
me
what
book
you
have
there
he
asked
as
they
turned
east
on
street
is
it
something
very
learned
or
very
frivolous
with
a
little
laugh
nancy
handed
him
the
package
you
can
open
it
if
you
promise
to
tie
it
up
again
she
said
watching
his
face
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
as
he
untied
the
string
he
glanced
from
the
book
to
her
face
trying
to
look
disapproving
though
he
could
not
quite
conceal
his
look
of
naïve
pleasure
frivolous
i
see
that
i
shall
have
to
direct
your
as
well
as
your
business
why
did
you
let
me
get
it
for
you
if
you
wanted
it
because
i
wanted
to
get
it
for
myself
you
probably
would
have
let
me
get
it
well
if
i
had
given
it
to
you
i
could
have
written
something
in
it
and
that
something
i
always
wanted
to
do
you
know
something
about
compliments
of
the
author
in
a
flowing
script
well
why
do
you
write
something
in
it
anyway
may
i
only
not
compliments
of
the
author
he
took
her
to
the
train
and
then
standing
beside
her
seat
took
out
his
fountain
pen
and
scribbled
on
the
of
the
little
volume
there
he
said
handing
it
back
to
her
now
i
am
going
to
see
you
again
in
the
holidays
am
i
not
i
have
enjoyed
two
or
three
hours
more
than
i
have
enjoyed
anything
in
years
he
took
her
hand
and
shook
it
warmly
and
then
as
the
train
gave
a
warning
jerk
he
hurried
off
with
the
great
fragrant
bunch
of
violets
at
her
waist
with
money
in
her
pocket
to
set
her
mind
at
rest
and
with
the
memory
of
a
singularly
pleasant
episode
nancy
saw
the
wintry
landscape
over
which
a
fresh
snow
was
beginning
to
fall
through
rosy
spectacles
somehow
not
even
the
thought
of
the
latest
and
greatest
trouble
loomed
so
very
black
and
terrifying
in
her
mind
she
glanced
down
at
the
little
book
in
her
lap
and
then
opened
it
at
the
he
had
written
to
commemorate
and
had
signed
it
simply
george
it
had
been
a
day
of
unusual
unhappiness
and
unusual
pleasure
not
even
he
had
understood
what
the
mingling
had
been
for
nancy
but
the
memory
of
the
pleasure
outweighed
the
memory
of
trouble
as
if
ashamed
of
herself
she
tried
to
fix
her
thoughts
on
plans
for
helping
and
advising
her
mother
and
alma
but
at
length
she
gave
it
up
to
review
the
little
delightful
trivial
memories
of
putting
off
the
recollection
of
trouble
until
chapter
xiv
paradise
cottage
the
of
december
a
red
letter
date
indeed
for
some
fifty
excited
bustling
girls
dawned
without
bringing
much
of
a
thrill
to
the
two
prescotts
neither
of
them
could
enter
with
genuine
enthusiasm
into
the
gay
holiday
anticipations
of
the
others
finding
in
them
too
depressing
a
contrast
to
their
own
expectations
of
a
not
very
happy
christmas
tide
nancy
had
shown
alma
their
mother
letter
and
had
had
several
long
and
serious
talks
with
the
poor
child
who
had
been
almost
overcome
with
despair
neither
of
them
even
thought
of
the
matter
of
the
examination
that
trouble
having
been
completely
wiped
out
by
the
newer
and
heavier
one
nor
did
they
draw
any
particular
satisfaction
from
the
fact
that
alma
latin
examination
had
been
credited
and
her
name
cleared
of
suspicion
while
the
identity
of
the
actual
culprit
remained
their
own
secret
the
debt
to
mildred
had
been
paid
alma
evidently
believing
that
the
money
had
been
sent
by
providence
and
asking
nancy
no
questions
so
far
as
the
matter
of
the
examination
was
concerned
miss
leland
had
allowed
the
subject
to
drop
simply
announcing
her
gratification
at
the
fact
that
there
had
unquestionably
been
a
mistake
and
that
miss
drinkwater
was
satisfied
on
this
point
a
coldness
that
reached
the
condition
of
an
almost
habitual
silence
sprang
up
between
alma
and
mildred
and
the
fact
that
mildred
asked
for
no
explanations
gave
further
circumstantial
proof
of
her
own
guilt
the
incident
of
her
trip
to
new
york
with
the
ring
and
her
meeting
with
arnold
nancy
did
not
mention
feeling
a
peculiar
shyness
about
it
and
a
wholesome
dread
of
being
teased
her
violets
had
been
smuggled
up
to
her
room
so
that
they
would
not
lead
to
questions
and
jokes
and
had
faded
away
slowly
in
an
inconspicuous
corner
diffusing
their
fragrance
extravagantly
as
they
drooped
and
wilted
over
the
edges
of
a
mug
but
two
of
them
had
been
chosen
to
immortalize
their
memory
and
had
been
carefully
pressed
between
the
pages
of
the
little
volume
of
stories
after
a
first
outburst
of
despair
and
tears
alma
had
taken
the
bad
news
from
home
with
a
quiet
pluck
that
surprised
and
touched
nancy
her
unquestioning
faith
in
nancy
was
revived
again
and
she
felt
that
if
nancy
could
take
a
cheerful
view
of
the
outlook
why
it
could
not
be
so
very
bad
they
left
for
home
again
on
the
early
afternoon
train
with
ten
or
fifteen
of
the
other
girls
all
of
whom
were
of
course
in
the
highest
spirits
only
charlotte
knew
that
they
would
not
return
to
miss
leland
after
the
holidays
and
her
sorrow
at
parting
with
nancy
was
touchingly
apparent
in
her
effort
to
seem
cheerful
it
was
after
four
when
the
two
girls
trudging
up
from
the
melbrook
station
through
the
snow
at
length
came
in
sight
of
the
little
brown
house
the
long
red
rays
of
the
sinking
sun
threw
the
shadows
of
the
bare
trees
across
the
unbroken
white
surface
of
the
lawn
and
the
cottage
with
its
gabled
roof
was
silhouetted
against
the
ruddy
western
sky
so
that
it
looked
as
if
the
light
were
radiating
from
it
oh
nancy
alma
turned
a
shining
face
to
her
sister
i
do
much
care
what
happens
it
home
and
nothing
can
change
that
mother
and
hannah
inside
and
there
a
fire
and
it
all
so
snug
and
safe
and
nancy
who
was
gazing
at
the
beloved
little
place
with
bright
dreamy
eyes
and
that
tender
smile
on
her
mouth
that
always
gave
her
face
a
singularly
winning
sweetness
answered
it
makes
me
think
of
a
picture
i
saw
once
it
was
called
the
at
paradise
i
do
know
why
it
was
just
the
picture
of
a
quaint
little
house
that
seemed
to
be
glowing
from
something
inside
of
it
and
perhaps
because
the
house
in
the
picture
made
me
think
of
our
home
i
always
thought
of
this
as
cottage
oh
my
dear
let
run
it
was
not
until
after
supper
when
they
had
gathered
around
the
fireside
just
as
they
used
to
in
and
slippers
that
they
opened
the
council
of
war
oh
my
dears
what
can
you
do
sighed
prescott
i
had
hoped
for
so
much
it
will
kill
me
to
feel
that
my
daughters
are
forced
to
work
for
their
living
by
my
fault
i
really
do
think
that
i
sort
of
like
to
make
some
money
added
alma
of
course
i
not
fitted
for
anything
in
particular
but
do
you
know
i
was
just
wondering
why
i
could
get
some
position
like
that
girl
in
dixon
do
you
know
what
she
said
that
after
the
first
of
the
year
she
expected
to
get
a
position
in
new
york
and
i
bet
my
hat
that
i
could
get
that
very
place
inspired
by
this
sudden
idea
alma
sat
bolt
upright
on
the
shabby
sofa
and
pursing
up
her
lips
with
looked
from
her
mother
to
nancy
who
promptly
applauded
brilliant
i
remember
her
saying
that
too
let
go
over
and
see
dixon
said
nancy
i
do
see
why
could
give
lessons
you
know
tutor
children
like
the
two
little
porterbridge
girls
for
example
margaret
does
go
to
school
because
she
so
delicate
and
i
know
that
last
winter
porterbridge
kept
dorothy
at
home
with
her
i
might
even
be
able
to
get
up
a
little
class
i
look
so
awfully
young
and
lots
of
girls
my
age
have
done
it
miss
drinkwater
at
school
told
me
that
she
had
begun
to
help
her
father
with
his
pupils
when
she
was
less
than
seventeen
and
i
be
eighteen
in
march
i
love
it
too
soon
they
were
all
chatting
and
laughing
like
schoolgirls
the
three
of
them
i
used
to
think
i
wanted
ever
so
many
things
observed
alma
with
a
pretty
little
air
of
earnest
thought
fulness
but
do
you
know
what
i
discovered
that
i
never
really
wanted
anything
more
than
what
already
got
you
and
nancy
mother
chapter
xv
the
incomprehensible
prescott
a
little
after
five
on
a
dull
january
afternoon
the
two
sisters
met
on
the
road
that
ran
from
melbrook
to
the
cottage
it
had
been
just
a
week
since
they
had
actually
started
in
working
alma
had
just
spoken
in
time
to
get
the
position
that
had
been
opened
in
the
young
village
lawyer
office
guided
by
a
kindly
providence
i
do
see
how
you
are
clever
enough
to
teach
nancy
said
alma
looking
at
her
sister
rather
tired
face
with
admiration
i
be
throwing
books
and
things
inside
of
five
minutes
but
is
it
wonderful
to
think
that
we
are
really
and
truly
making
money
did
you
ever
believe
that
we
could
do
it
i
just
hope
that
uncle
thomas
hears
what
we
are
doing
that
just
show
him
that
we
do
want
anything
from
i
wonder
what
mildred
would
say
to
us
would
she
be
shocked
though
inside
the
little
house
alma
banged
the
door
behind
her
while
nancy
shouted
gaily
to
her
mother
well
well
well
what
is
all
this
noise
for
inquired
a
calm
masculine
voice
from
the
the
two
girls
stopped
still
thunderstruck
for
the
voice
unfamiliar
in
its
genial
accents
was
nevertheless
unmistakably
the
voice
of
prescott
alma
stared
at
nancy
nancy
stared
back
at
alma
neither
of
them
knowing
whether
to
stay
where
they
were
or
to
go
forward
i
sha
bite
remarked
prescott
mildly
nancy
boldly
advanced
being
on
more
familiar
terms
with
the
ogre
than
the
frankly
terrified
alma
and
to
alma
amazement
he
proceeded
to
kiss
them
both
and
then
as
if
embarrassed
cleared
his
throat
and
said
in
a
dry
formal
tone
in
a
few
moments
prescott
came
downstairs
she
looked
older
and
sadder
than
she
had
the
last
time
he
had
seen
her
and
because
she
had
denied
herself
any
new
clothes
since
she
had
lost
the
money
she
now
wore
an
old
gown
which
she
had
had
for
years
it
was
not
a
pose
with
her
for
she
no
longer
pitied
herself
or
bemoaned
her
limited
means
but
rather
a
sincere
desire
to
punish
herself
for
having
as
she
believed
deprived
her
daughters
of
what
she
considered
the
best
things
in
life
nevertheless
her
natural
instinct
for
daintiness
had
asserted
itself
in
the
little
touches
of
lace
at
the
neck
and
wrists
and
she
looked
pretty
and
dignified
as
she
greeted
prescott
it
was
not
long
before
the
first
feeling
of
constraint
wore
off
as
alma
said
afterwards
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
they
had
been
laughing
and
chatting
with
the
ogre
just
as
if
he
were
a
nice
old
man
he
called
prescott
lallie
and
paid
her
two
compliments
he
gave
them
a
very
long
discourse
on
the
value
of
a
scientific
education
for
everybody
and
from
that
veered
off
into
a
heated
tirade
against
the
uselessness
of
modern
education
anyway
am
i
to
understand
that
you
two
young
ladies
are
earning
money
inquired
prescott
amusement
chagrin
curiosity
and
admiration
were
mingled
in
his
changing
expressions
indeed
we
are
replied
alma
quite
beaming
with
so
much
of
course
nancy
makes
more
than
i
now
nance
is
much
cleverer
than
i
but
nancy
work
is
more
the
intellectual
kind
you
know
and
nancy
will
probably
be
famous
and
i
be
rich
bless
my
soul
gasped
the
ogre
then
suddenly
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
and
laughed
nor
could
nancy
and
prescott
keep
from
joining
in
the
more
alma
proclaimed
her
enthusiasm
for
business
the
more
patent
her
utterly
delightful
inaptitude
for
it
became
then
he
grew
grave
and
turning
to
prescott
said
in
a
gentle
friendly
voice
lallie
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
everything
that
has
happened
i
would
be
very
dull
indeed
if
i
could
not
guess
that
you
and
my
nieces
have
had
a
new
misfortune
i
blame
myself
i
i
have
made
mistakes
and
well
life
is
very
short
prescott
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
sat
up
stiffly
as
if
uncertain
whether
she
should
listen
to
the
dictates
of
her
pride
or
of
her
hopes
then
presently
speaking
in
a
quiet
monotonous
voice
she
told
him
about
her
bad
investment
and
why
she
had
made
it
when
prescott
had
finished
speaking
everyone
was
silent
for
a
little
while
then
prescott
said
abruptly
you
have
been
only
vain
lallie
then
bluntly
but
not
unkindly
turning
to
prescott
very
vain
very
foolish
and
now
that
we
talked
business
i
going
to
ask
if
i
may
stay
to
supper
of
course
he
stayed
and
hannah
as
she
saw
the
last
of
her
delicacies
vanishing
silently
down
the
ogre
lean
old
throat
indulged
in
a
bright
vision
of
his
eventual
surrender
but
having
stuck
to
his
principles
for
thirteen
years
prescott
was
not
a
man
to
change
them
in
a
moment
of
impulse
after
that
evening
at
his
niece
he
made
no
further
reference
to
their
affairs
and
seemed
quite
oblivious
of
their
difficulties
some
very
narrow
straits
lay
ahead
of
the
prescotts
and
they
had
to
deny
themselves
things
that
once
their
little
income
had
allowed
them
winter
wore
away
into
spring
and
the
girls
went
on
doggedly
with
their
tasks
miss
bancroft
had
gone
away
for
a
month
or
so
they
had
been
to
see
her
several
times
during
the
winter
and
she
had
dropped
in
to
see
prescott
fairly
often
there
had
been
something
very
delightful
in
those
few
afternoons
spent
with
her
for
she
was
one
of
those
charming
old
ladies
who
remain
perennially
girlish
and
her
interest
and
sympathy
in
their
talk
had
won
from
them
a
very
warm
affection
arnold
had
not
appeared
on
the
scenes
during
the
entire
winter
and
spring
having
gone
to
england
miss
bancroft
had
casually
explained
for
an
indefinite
stay
this
intelligence
had
depressed
nancy
unaccountably
but
she
explained
her
depression
to
herself
on
the
grounds
that
she
was
worried
about
reclaiming
the
ring
which
she
valued
so
dearly
as
the
days
grew
longer
they
had
their
tea
out
in
the
little
garden
which
nancy
zealously
tended
and
these
pleasant
evenings
made
the
whole
day
seem
quite
cheerful
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
incessant
worry
about
the
future
one
afternoon
in
the
middle
of
the
month
they
were
sitting
out
in
the
little
arbor
where
the
vines
covered
with
a
veil
of
delicate
sticky
little
leaves
already
offered
a
light
shade
from
the
beams
of
the
western
sun
as
nancy
turned
her
head
to
say
something
joking
to
alma
she
noticed
for
the
first
time
how
very
quiet
her
sister
had
been
while
they
had
been
talking
alma
was
lying
full
length
on
the
little
bench
with
her
arm
across
her
eyes
evidently
feeling
that
her
mother
and
sister
were
wondering
what
was
the
matter
she
took
away
her
arm
revealing
a
feverishly
flushed
face
and
heavy
eyelids
i
just
have
a
beastly
old
headache
she
explained
drowsily
it
is
anything
but
spring
fever
you
poor
little
kid
cried
nancy
going
to
her
in
concern
and
throwing
her
arm
around
her
it
is
anything
said
alma
feebly
i
had
it
yesterday
too
but
it
was
so
bad
well
i
going
to
see
if
you
have
any
fever
anyway
nancy
said
quietly
not
liking
the
look
of
alma
hot
cheeks
and
crimson
lips
they
got
alma
to
bed
and
in
a
few
moments
after
her
head
had
sunk
into
the
cool
pillow
she
had
dozed
off
into
a
heavy
sleep
nancy
tried
to
conceal
her
uneasiness
but
alma
had
a
fever
of
a
hundred
and
one
which
is
not
common
to
a
simple
headache
but
the
visit
from
bevan
cheerful
as
he
was
did
anything
but
set
their
fears
at
rest
nancy
could
only
stare
from
him
to
her
mother
in
speechless
consternation
when
it
developed
next
day
that
alma
had
the
measles
beyond
a
doubt
in
the
morning
dixon
and
the
porterbridges
were
notified
that
the
prescotts
could
not
be
at
their
work
the
situation
was
indeed
a
pretty
serious
crisis
in
their
career
for
their
income
was
reduced
at
once
by
something
over
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
this
worry
however
was
completely
dwarfed
when
on
the
third
day
after
alma
had
fallen
ill
bevan
announced
that
he
thought
it
best
to
send
a
trained
nurse
nancy
had
had
about
all
that
she
could
bear
and
without
saying
another
word
rushed
off
to
bury
her
face
in
the
sofa
cushions
and
smother
her
frantic
sobs
from
her
mother
ears
it
seemed
to
her
absolutely
certain
that
alma
was
going
to
die
and
her
mind
filled
with
little
forgotten
memories
each
of
which
stabbed
her
with
an
agonizing
pang
of
misery
the
nurse
a
very
tall
strong
rosy
woman
named
miss
tracy
arrived
about
and
quickly
changing
into
her
stiff
white
uniform
ordered
prescott
off
to
lie
down
telling
nancy
that
there
was
no
need
for
either
of
them
to
worry
her
presence
her
brisk
thorough
confident
manner
lifted
a
hundred
pounds
from
their
hearts
and
for
the
first
time
in
three
days
they
drew
a
breath
of
relief
prescott
who
sadly
needed
sleep
lay
down
in
her
own
room
and
nancy
who
had
not
been
out
of
the
house
since
alma
had
fallen
ill
took
a
book
and
went
out
onto
the
porch
to
free
her
mind
of
worries
that
seemed
to
have
dulled
her
thoughts
everything
had
become
so
complicated
it
was
so
utterly
impossible
to
know
what
was
to
be
done
that
she
felt
as
if
it
were
no
use
worrying
as
if
something
unforeseen
would
have
to
happen
to
solve
difficulties
that
were
absolutely
beyond
their
power
to
solve
and
so
she
merely
wondered
idly
how
the
bills
and
the
doctor
bills
were
to
be
paid
and
finally
the
warm
air
and
the
whirr
of
the
and
the
sleepy
hum
in
the
vines
made
her
drowsy
her
eyelids
fell
opened
and
then
closed
again
oh
yes
i
a
very
great
man
i
know
the
king
of
england
intimately
someone
who
did
not
look
at
all
arnold
a
fat
man
with
whiskers
who
however
was
arnold
kept
repeating
to
her
and
she
kept
wondering
why
did
i
think
he
was
so
nice
why
did
i
think
he
was
then
all
at
once
she
heard
someone
coming
up
the
wooden
steps
of
the
porch
she
sat
bolt
upright
putting
hasty
hands
to
her
tumbled
curly
hair
and
with
dazed
sleepy
eyes
stared
at
the
newcomer
with
a
positively
unintelligent
expression
of
amazement
at
length
she
articulated
in
an
almost
reproachful
tone
i
thought
you
were
in
europe
you
in
europe
yes
but
one
does
have
to
stay
in
europe
you
know
unless
they
put
you
in
jail
over
there
and
i
always
try
to
avoid
that
returned
arnold
pleasantly
but
you
been
there
for
months
said
nancy
quite
aware
that
she
was
talking
perfectly
good
sense
and
then
they
both
burst
out
laughing
alma
is
ill
nancy
told
him
she
has
measles
and
we
are
in
quarantine
so
you
ought
to
go
away
he
looked
at
her
tired
face
where
the
strain
of
fear
and
trouble
showed
in
her
pale
cheeks
and
heavy
eyes
and
then
he
smiled
in
his
warm
understanding
way
and
said
gently
you
been
worried
to
death
about
something
have
you
nancy
well
i
not
going
to
ask
you
any
questions
now
only
whenever
you
feel
that
you
want
to
remember
that
you
can
tell
me
anything
would
you
rather
i
went
away
now
and
came
back
later
on
when
you
are
less
troubled
is
there
anything
i
can
do
oh
do
go
away
i
mean
it
very
nice
to
see
you
alma
has
a
nurse
now
and
i
think
she
is
going
to
be
better
soon
and
it
so
to
see
you
does
prescott
know
of
alma
illness
he
asked
after
a
hesitation
i
do
think
my
aunt
does
she
has
just
come
back
i
landed
the
day
before
yesterday
and
came
down
here
last
night
i
i
asked
her
about
you
all
and
she
said
nothing
about
alma
being
no
i
do
suppose
uncle
thomas
does
know
answered
nancy
he
comes
over
to
see
us
every
now
and
then
but
then
again
he
shut
himself
up
for
quite
a
long
while
and
i
do
think
he
knows
what
we
are
doing
any
more
than
we
know
what
he
doing
you
know
i
buying
a
house
here
in
melbrook
said
arnold
rather
irrelevantly
a
very
nice
house
do
you
know
that
yellow
one
with
the
white
columns
and
the
over
on
tindale
road
i
do
know
the
one
you
mean
cried
nancy
it
a
beauty
the
loveliest
garden
that
it
that
the
one
i
you
sure
you
like
it
for
some
reason
or
other
nancy
turned
pink
at
this
simple
question
and
tried
to
stammer
a
casual
reply
then
he
went
on
serenely
i
expect
to
have
it
in
pretty
good
shape
in
a
week
or
two
and
when
your
sister
is
better
i
love
to
have
you
and
your
mother
and
alma
come
over
and
have
tea
with
me
aunt
eliza
is
directing
the
furnishing
and
all
that
she
quite
in
her
element
but
i
love
to
have
your
expert
advice
too
heavens
do
know
anything
about
chintz
and
scrim
and
all
that
sort
of
foolishness
he
chatted
along
telling
her
about
his
trip
recounting
amusing
little
incidents
of
the
things
that
had
happened
on
the
boat
and
completely
carrying
her
thoughts
away
from
her
own
personal
affairs
but
after
a
little
while
she
began
to
notice
that
he
was
really
not
thinking
about
what
he
was
saying
that
he
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
which
he
was
always
on
the
point
of
saying
and
then
veered
off
to
something
else
all
at
once
he
got
up
and
remarked
abruptly
what
the
dickens
do
i
care
personally
for
chintzes
and
scrim
i
know
which
is
which
nancy
stared
at
him
thinking
that
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses
he
rammed
his
long
brown
hands
fiercely
into
the
pockets
of
his
gray
trousers
took
them
out
again
and
thrust
them
into
the
pockets
of
his
coat
then
as
if
he
had
taken
a
deep
breath
and
was
holding
it
he
said
will
you
marry
me
nancy
she
could
not
have
uttered
a
word
she
simply
sat
and
stared
at
him
then
without
being
conscious
of
a
single
idea
in
her
head
she
jumped
up
and
made
a
dive
for
the
door
he
caught
her
hand
and
made
her
turn
around
and
face
him
he
had
begun
to
smile
slightly
and
it
was
that
gentle
wonderfully
sweet
smile
and
that
made
her
blush
from
the
yoke
of
her
gingham
dress
up
to
the
edge
of
her
hair
well
will
you
i
i
do
know
stammered
nancy
with
that
she
promptly
turned
and
fled
into
the
house
arnold
stood
regarding
the
with
a
blank
expression
then
after
a
moment
or
two
he
walked
away
slowly
it
was
not
until
he
had
reached
the
gate
that
he
remembered
he
had
left
his
hat
on
one
of
the
porch
chairs
alma
was
sitting
up
wrapped
in
a
pink
blanket
with
her
yellow
curls
pinned
on
top
of
her
head
where
they
nodded
like
the
heads
of
daffodils
surrounded
by
her
admiring
family
including
hannah
and
the
trained
nurse
and
a
perfect
garden
of
spring
flowers
which
had
been
arriving
daily
since
the
appearance
of
arnold
she
was
convalescing
visibly
i
did
know
that
arnold
was
back
said
alma
burying
her
small
nose
in
a
huge
bouquet
of
white
lilacs
is
it
perfectly
dear
of
him
to
send
these
things
when
i
only
met
him
once
in
my
life
upon
which
guileless
remark
nancy
turned
a
lively
and
hopelessly
noticeable
scarlet
to
make
her
embarrassment
quite
complete
alma
looked
directly
into
her
eyes
and
grinned
deliberately
i
wonder
why
he
takes
such
a
tremendous
interest
in
us
she
went
on
mercilessly
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
i
feel
as
if
something
perfectly
scrumptious
were
going
to
happen
prescott
laughed
and
kissed
her
now
nancy
come
on
and
up
was
the
bomb
which
alma
hurled
without
a
word
of
warning
i
know
perfectly
well
that
you
got
something
on
your
conscience
and
i
got
a
suspicion
already
that
it
mr
arnold
if
she
was
desirous
of
creating
a
sensation
she
should
have
been
amply
satisfied
with
the
result
of
her
remarks
prescott
as
if
she
had
been
suddenly
aroused
from
sleep
opened
her
pretty
mouth
and
stared
at
her
elder
daughter
for
a
moment
and
then
exclaimed
i
must
have
been
dreaming
nancy
squirmed
she
looked
reproachfully
at
alma
then
at
her
mother
and
at
length
said
simply
he
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
and
then
she
followed
with
the
whole
story
she
told
them
of
her
visit
to
her
uncle
where
she
had
seen
arnold
for
the
second
time
and
then
went
on
to
give
a
full
account
of
her
memorable
trip
to
the
pawnbrokers
with
the
ring
i
i
would
have
told
you
everything
long
ago
but
i
did
want
you
to
think
that
uncle
thomas
was
because
he
asked
me
to
visit
him
and
about
the
other
time
alma
stopped
her
by
leaning
over
and
kissing
her
you
were
paying
for
experience
alma
said
bravely
i
learned
i
do
know
what
exactly
except
that
people
like
mildred
whom
i
always
thought
as
being
important
to
know
were
worth
one
teeny
little
ounce
of
trouble
i
learned
to
be
honest
with
myself
and
that
it
a
whole
lot
better
to
work
with
your
two
hands
than
to
be
a
toady
for
the
sake
of
making
things
easier
and
lots
else
and
going
to
work
hard
nancy
stuff
and
nonsense
declared
an
angry
voice
from
the
doorway
from
a
gargantuan
bouquet
of
hyacinths
lilacs
and
daffodils
issued
the
voice
of
the
ogre
evidently
finding
the
front
door
open
and
the
lower
floor
deserted
and
hearing
the
sound
of
voices
from
above
the
old
gentleman
had
borne
his
offering
aloft
without
a
word
of
announcement
snorting
with
some
inward
indignation
he
testily
tossed
his
head
to
get
rid
of
an
impudent
lilac
which
was
tickling
his
nose
and
glared
over
the
bouquet
this
idea
of
working
is
pure
foolishness
i
never
heard
of
such
women
nonsense
before
in
my
life
here
where
in
the
name
of
common
sense
can
i
put
these
flowers
and
why
was
i
informed
of
my
illness
when
nancy
stifling
her
unseemly
laughter
had
relieved
him
of
his
offering
he
grew
calmer
why
was
i
told
that
you
were
ill
my
dear
he
asked
sitting
down
and
taking
alma
hand
in
his
we
we
hardly
thought
of
anything
until
she
began
to
be
better
answered
prescott
he
looked
at
her
sternly
a
moment
and
then
his
whole
face
softened
almost
to
a
look
of
humility
and
once
you
told
me
that
you
were
a
foolish
woman
lallie
he
said
and
i
must
confess
that
for
a
very
long
time
i
was
blind
enough
and
selfish
enough
to
think
it
of
you
now
it
only
fair
that
i
should
be
as
brave
as
you
and
admit
that
i
have
been
a
very
foolish
man
i
have
been
about
the
biggest
fool
that
ever
escaped
the
badge
of
long
ears
all
i
did
was
to
deprive
myself
of
a
lot
of
happiness
and
to
deprive
some
other
very
dear
people
of
happiness
that
it
was
my
privilege
to
bestow
now
the
truth
is
that
while
my
were
excellent
they
would
work
they
did
do
any
good
hang
it
all
here
i
was
trying
to
make
good
thrifty
wives
out
of
you
two
girls
for
some
young
rascal
and
depriving
myself
of
the
sweetest
pleasure
in
life
for
that
same
impudent
young
husband
who
sha
have
you
anyway
they
were
excellent
principles
too
their
only
fault
being
that
they
would
work
and
now
ladies
i
herewith
adopt
you
i
shall
establish
my
legal
right
to
you
all
i
i
feel
well
i
hope
i
have
made
it
quite
clear
that
anything
everything
on
this
green
earth
that
i
can
give
you
is
yours
and
if
you
want
to
make
me
very
happy
you
demand
it
instantly
for
a
little
time
no
one
said
anything
then
heaving
a
great
sigh
alma
burst
out
uncle
thomas
i
expire
if
i
do
hug
you
and
when
she
hugged
him
until
there
was
more
likelihood
of
demise
than
her
own
he
said
i
afraid
i
breaking
up
a
brilliant
business
career
for
you
the
little
that
i
can
offer
you
is
a
mere
nothing
compared
to
the
dazzling
prospects
which
were
opening
before
you
you
need
be
jocose
uncle
interrupted
alma
severely
many
a
millionaire
started
on
only
five
cents
and
started
on
fifteen
dollars
i
hear
that
young
arnold
is
buying
a
house
here
remarked
prescott
now
what
in
the
world
is
he
doing
that
for
why
indeed
murmured
alma
wickedly
the
truth
is
uncle
thomas
that
he
is
madly
in
love
with
me
he
sent
me
all
these
flowers
and
measles
or
no
measles
he
has
been
serenading
me
every
night
he
miss
tracy
alma
you
ridiculous
creature
cried
prescott
joining
in
the
laugh
at
this
nonsense
uncle
thomas
looked
amused
but
puzzled
hardly
certain
whether
to
believe
there
was
an
element
of
truth
in
this
rigmarole
or
not
he
glanced
from
prescott
to
alma
to
nancy
and
there
he
paused
he
was
a
good
enough
reader
of
faces
to
know
now
where
the
wind
lay
and
his
eyes
grew
sober
well
my
dear
little
niece
you
pretty
young
he
said
gently
but
one
is
never
too
young
to
be
happy
what
do
you
think
lallie
prescott
smiled
although
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
said
ask
nancy
uncle
thomas
well
nancy
nancy
tried
to
laugh
as
she
took
her
mother
hand
and
alma
and
faltered
again
i
i
do
know
but
here
we
who
can
see
into
the
minds
of
all
these
people
have
no
hesitation
about
saying
in
just
so
many
words
that
she
did
know
very
well
only
she
did
know
that
she
knew
the
ogre
had
sent
a
note
to
his
nieces
asking
them
for
dinner
on
a
certain
june
evening
and
strange
to
relate
it
was
nancy
who
delayed
the
proceedings
when
she
finally
joined
her
admiring
family
she
was
deliciously
conscious
that
a
dress
of
pale
organdie
and
a
hat
trimmed
with
delicate
blue
flowers
were
about
the
most
becoming
things
she
could
possibly
wear
and
she
was
not
entirely
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
she
could
be
very
very
pretty
when
she
wanted
to
it
was
pleasant
to
register
this
interesting
fact
on
other
people
also
miss
bancroft
and
the
ogre
and
well
george
arnold
for
instance
it
was
partly
on
account
of
the
gathering
darkness
no
doubt
or
partly
because
alma
wanted
to
look
at
the
while
nancy
and
george
wanted
to
continue
to
look
at
the
roses
but
however
it
was
well
there
they
were
arnold
and
miss
prescott
absorbedly
looking
at
the
roses
or
perhaps
they
were
even
looking
at
the
roses
now
look
here
nancy
if
you
be
a
good
girl
and
say
what
i
tell
you
to
i
give
you
something
nice
it
not
a
candy
either
do
you
want
me
to
say
gasped
nancy
suddenly
feeling
quite
terrified
first
of
all
put
your
hand
in
mine
so
he
took
her
hand
gently
and
then
lifted
it
to
his
lips
and
now
say
love
you
george
oh
i
whispered
nancy
feebly
yes
you
can
try
it
dear
well
do
you
nancy
for
the
first
time
he
sounded
very
grave
and
his
eyes
looked
anxious
then
somehow
nancy
felt
quite
calm
and
happy
and
brave
she
answered
him
honestly
yes
i
do
i
love
you
george
she
felt
him
take
her
left
hand
and
single
out
the
third
finger
then
she
felt
something
cool
slipped
on
it
she
gasped
the
first
diamond
she
had
ever
owned
caught
and
flashed
back
a
moonbeam
oh
i
did
know
it
was
that
she
stammered
i
would
have
said
what
what
you
wanted
me
to
anyway
george
i
mean
wanted
to
awfully
he
promptly
kissed
her
