one
shape
your
plans
where
the
fire
is
bright
the
shimmering
glasses
are
the
woods
are
white
in
the
winter
night
the
northern
chapter
one
it
was
during
the
holiday
week
that
eddie
proposed
the
matter
that
is
eddie
way
no
date
for
him
is
too
far
ahead
to
begin
to
plan
anything
that
has
flies
in
it
and
tents
and
the
prospect
of
the
campfire
smell
the
very
mention
of
these
things
will
make
his
hair
bristle
up
rather
straight
still
hair
it
is
and
silvered
over
with
premature
wisdom
and
put
a
new
glare
into
his
spectacles
rather
wide
round
spectacles
they
are
until
he
looks
even
more
like
an
anarchist
than
usual
more
indeed
than
in
the
old
heidelberg
days
when
as
a
matter
of
truth
he
is
a
gentle
soul
sometimes
when
he
has
transgressed
or
thinks
he
has
almost
humble
as
i
was
saying
it
was
during
the
holidays
about
the
end
of
the
week
as
i
remember
it
and
i
was
writing
some
letters
at
the
club
in
the
little
raised
corner
that
looks
out
on
the
park
when
i
happened
to
glance
down
toward
the
fireplace
and
saw
eddie
sitting
as
nearly
on
his
coat
collar
as
possible
in
one
of
the
wide
chairs
and
as
nearly
in
the
open
hickory
fire
as
he
could
get
pawing
over
a
book
of
silver
doctors
brown
hackles
and
the
like
and
dreaming
a
long
long
dream
now
i
confess
there
is
something
about
a
book
of
trout
flies
even
at
the
year
end
when
all
the
brooks
are
flint
and
gorged
with
white
when
all
the
north
country
hides
under
seamless
raiment
that
stretches
even
to
the
pole
itself
even
at
such
a
time
i
say
there
is
something
about
those
bits
of
gimp
and
gut
and
feathers
and
steel
that
prick
up
the
red
blood
of
any
man
or
of
any
woman
for
that
matter
who
has
ever
flung
one
of
those
gaudy
things
into
a
swirl
of
dark
water
and
felt
the
swift
savage
tug
on
the
line
and
heard
the
music
of
the
singing
reel
i
forgot
that
i
was
writing
letters
and
went
over
there
tell
me
about
it
eddie
i
said
where
are
you
going
this
time
then
he
unfolded
to
me
a
marvelous
plan
it
was
a
place
in
nova
scotia
he
had
been
there
once
before
only
this
time
he
was
going
a
different
route
farther
into
the
wilderness
the
deep
unknown
somewhere
even
the
guides
had
never
been
perhaps
stray
logmen
had
been
there
or
the
indians
sportsmen
never
there
had
been
no
complete
surveys
even
by
the
government
certain
rivers
were
known
by
their
outlets
certain
lakes
by
name
it
was
likely
that
they
formed
the
usual
network
and
that
the
circuit
could
be
made
by
water
with
occasional
carries
unquestionably
the
waters
swarmed
with
trout
a
certain
imaginative
indian
supposed
to
have
penetrated
the
unknown
had
declared
that
at
one
place
were
trout
the
size
of
one
leg
eddie
became
excited
as
he
talked
and
his
hair
bristled
he
set
down
a
list
of
the
waters
so
far
as
known
the
names
of
certain
guides
a
number
of
articles
of
provision
and
an
array
of
camp
paraphernalia
finally
he
made
maps
and
other
drawings
and
began
to
add
figures
it
was
dusk
when
we
got
back
the
lights
were
winking
along
the
park
over
the
way
and
somewhere
through
the
night
across
a
waste
of
cold
lay
the
land
we
had
visited
still
waiting
to
be
explored
we
wandered
out
into
the
dining
room
and
settled
the
matter
across
a
table
when
we
rose
from
it
i
was
pledged
pledged
for
june
and
this
was
still
december
the
tail
of
the
old
year
chapter
two
let
us
buy
for
the
days
of
spring
yet
the
north
winds
blow
half
the
joy
of
the
trip
my
boy
getting
your
traps
to
chapter
two
immediately
we
that
is
to
say
eddie
began
to
buy
things
it
is
eddie
way
to
read
and
to
consult
catalogues
with
a
view
of
making
a
variety
of
purchases
he
has
had
a
great
deal
of
experience
in
the
matter
of
camp
life
but
being
a
modest
man
he
has
a
fund
of
respect
for
the
experience
of
others
any
one
who
has
had
enough
ability
or
time
to
write
a
book
on
the
subject
and
enough
perseverance
or
money
to
get
it
published
can
preach
the
gospel
of
the
woods
to
eddie
in
the
matter
of
camp
appointments
and
even
the
manufacturers
catalogues
are
considered
sound
reading
as
a
result
he
has
accumulated
an
amazing
collection
of
articles
adapted
to
every
time
and
season
to
every
change
of
wind
and
temperature
to
every
spot
where
the
tent
gleams
white
in
the
campfire
blaze
from
greenland
icy
mountains
to
coral
strand
far
be
it
from
me
to
deride
or
deprecate
this
tendency
even
though
it
were
a
ruling
passion
there
are
days
and
nights
too
recalled
now
with
only
a
heart
full
of
gratitude
because
of
almost
inexhaustible
storehouse
of
comforts
for
soul
and
flesh
the
direct
result
of
those
and
those
catalogues
and
of
the
wild
sweet
joy
he
always
found
in
making
lists
and
laying
in
supplies
not
having
a
turn
that
way
myself
he
had
but
small
respect
for
my
ideas
of
woodcraft
and
laid
down
the
law
of
the
forest
to
me
with
a
firm
hand
when
i
hinted
that
i
should
need
a
new
lancewood
rod
he
promptly
annulled
the
thought
when
i
suggested
that
i
might
aspire
as
far
as
a
rather
good
split
bamboo
of
a
light
but
serviceable
kind
he
dispelled
the
ambition
forthwith
you
want
a
noibwood
he
said
i
have
just
ordered
one
and
i
will
take
you
to
the
same
place
to
get
it
illustration
it
was
a
field
day
for
eddie
and
he
bought
more
i
had
never
heard
of
this
particular
variety
of
timber
and
it
seemed
that
eddie
had
never
heard
of
it
either
except
in
a
catalogue
and
from
the
lips
of
a
dealer
who
had
imported
a
considerable
amount
of
the
material
yet
i
went
along
meekly
enough
and
ordered
under
his
direction
i
also
selected
an
assortment
of
flies
the
prettiest
he
would
let
me
buy
a
few
others
which
i
had
set
my
heart
on
i
had
the
dealer
slip
in
when
eddie
was
looking
i
was
about
to
buy
a
curious
thing
which
a
trout
could
not
come
near
without
fatal
results
when
the
wide
glare
of
his
spectacles
rested
on
me
and
my
courage
failed
then
he
selected
for
me
a
long
landing
net
for
use
in
the
canoe
and
another
with
an
elastic
loop
to
go
about
the
neck
for
wading
leaders
and
and
the
other
elementary
necessaries
of
angling
in
the
northern
woods
of
course
such
things
were
as
a
b
c
to
eddie
he
had
them
in
infinite
variety
but
it
was
a
field
day
and
he
bought
more
we
were
out
of
the
place
at
last
and
i
was
heaving
a
sigh
of
relief
that
this
part
of
it
was
over
and
i
need
give
the
matter
no
further
thought
when
eddie
remarked
well
we
made
a
pretty
good
start
we
can
come
down
here
a
lot
of
times
between
now
and
june
but
what
for
i
asked
oh
for
things
you
have
a
sleeping
bag
yet
and
we
be
thinking
of
other
stuff
right
along
we
can
stay
over
a
day
in
boston
too
and
get
some
things
there
i
always
do
that
you
want
a
good
many
things
you
ca
get
them
in
the
woods
you
know
eddie
was
right
about
having
plenty
of
time
for
this
was
january
he
was
wrong
however
about
being
unable
to
get
things
in
the
woods
i
did
often
i
got
eddie
chapter
three
the
gorges
break
and
the
streamlets
the
sap
begins
to
flow
each
green
bud
that
stirs
my
a
summons
and
i
must
chapter
three
eddie
could
not
wait
until
june
when
the
earliest
april
buds
became
tiny
beads
that
green
which
is
like
the
green
of
no
other
substance
or
season
along
certain
gray
branches
in
the
park
across
the
way
when
there
was
a
hint
and
flavor
of
stirring
life
in
the
morning
sun
then
there
came
a
new
bristle
into
eddie
hair
a
new
gleam
into
his
glasses
and
i
felt
that
the
wood
gods
were
calling
and
that
he
must
obey
it
is
proper
that
one
of
us
should
go
on
ahead
he
argued
and
be
arranging
for
guides
canoes
and
the
like
at
the
other
end
i
urged
that
it
was
too
soon
that
the
north
was
still
white
and
hard
with
cold
that
preliminaries
could
be
arranged
by
letter
i
finally
suggested
that
there
were
still
many
things
he
would
want
to
buy
he
wavered
then
but
it
was
no
use
eddie
can
put
on
a
dinner
dress
with
the
best
and
he
has
dined
with
kings
but
he
is
a
a
and
a
in
his
soul
and
the
gods
of
his
ancestors
were
not
to
be
gainsaid
he
must
be
on
the
ground
he
declared
and
as
for
the
additional
articles
we
might
need
he
would
send
me
lists
of
course
i
knew
he
would
do
that
just
as
i
knew
that
the
one
and
mighty
reason
for
his
going
was
to
be
where
he
could
smell
the
first
breath
of
the
budding
north
and
catch
the
first
flash
and
gleam
of
the
waking
trout
in
the
nearby
waters
he
was
off
then
and
the
lists
came
as
promised
i
employed
a
sort
of
general
purchasing
agent
at
length
to
attend
to
them
though
this
i
dared
not
confess
for
to
eddie
it
would
have
been
a
sacrilege
not
easy
to
forgive
that
i
could
delegate
to
another
any
of
the
precious
pleasure
of
preparation
and
reduce
the
sacred
functions
of
securing
certain
brands
of
eating
chocolate
camp
candles
and
boot
grease
three
kinds
to
a
commercial
basis
would
i
felt
be
a
thing
almost
impossible
to
explain
the
final
list
he
notified
me
would
be
mailed
to
a
hotel
in
boston
for
the
reason
he
said
that
it
contained
things
nowhere
else
procurable
though
i
am
convinced
that
a
greater
reason
was
a
conviction
on
his
part
that
no
trip
could
be
complete
without
buying
a
few
articles
in
boston
at
the
last
hour
before
sailing
and
his
desire
for
me
to
experience
this
concluding
touch
of
the
joy
of
preparation
yet
i
was
glad
on
the
whole
for
i
was
able
to
buy
secretly
some
things
he
never
would
have
permitted
among
them
a
phantom
minnow
which
looked
like
a
tin
whistle
a
little
bamboo
rod
and
a
gorgeous
jock
scott
fly
with
two
hooks
the
tin
whistle
and
the
jock
scott
looked
deadly
and
the
rod
seemed
adapted
to
a
certain
repose
of
muscle
after
a
period
of
activity
with
the
noibwood
i
decided
to
conceal
these
purchases
about
my
person
and
use
them
when
eddie
was
looking
but
then
it
was
sailing
time
and
as
the
energetic
steamer
dropped
away
from
the
dock
a
storm
there
had
been
none
for
weeks
before
set
in
and
we
pitched
and
rolled
and
through
a
dim
disordered
night
i
clung
to
my
berth
and
groaned
and
stared
at
my
things
in
the
corner
and
hated
them
according
to
my
condition
then
morning
brought
quiet
waters
and
the
custom
house
at
yarmouth
where
the
tourist
who
is
bringing
in
money
and
maybe
a
few
other
things
is
made
duly
welcome
and
not
bothered
with
a
lot
of
irrelevant
questions
what
nova
scotia
most
needs
is
money
and
the
fisherman
and
the
hunter
once
through
the
custom
house
become
a
greater
source
of
revenue
than
any
tax
that
could
be
laid
on
their
modest
not
to
say
paltry
baggage
even
though
the
contents
of
one
trunk
be
the
result
of
a
list
such
as
only
eddie
can
prepare
there
is
a
wholesome
restaurant
at
yarmouth
too
just
by
the
dock
where
after
a
tossing
night
at
sea
one
welcomes
a
breakfast
of
good
salt
ham
with
eggs
and
pie
two
kinds
of
the
latter
pumpkin
and
mince
i
had
always
wondered
where
the
went
after
it
reached
boston
now
i
know
that
it
extends
across
to
yarmouth
and
so
continues
up
through
nova
scotia
to
halifax
certain
new
englanders
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
went
down
to
nova
scotia
for
the
reason
that
they
fostered
a
deeper
affection
for
george
the
king
than
for
george
of
the
cherry
tree
and
hatchet
the
cherry
limb
became
too
vigorous
in
their
old
homes
and
the
hatchet
too
sharp
so
they
crossed
over
and
took
the
end
of
the
along
they
maintained
their
general
habits
and
speech
too
which
in
nova
scotia
are
almost
identical
with
those
of
new
england
but
i
digress
a
grave
and
besetting
sin
i
had
hoped
eddie
would
welcome
me
at
the
railway
station
after
the
long
forenoon
ride
rather
lonely
in
spite
of
the
new
land
and
the
fact
that
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
fisherman
who
taught
me
how
to
put
wrappings
on
a
rod
eddie
did
not
meet
me
he
sent
the
wagon
instead
and
i
enjoyed
a
ride
across
june
hills
where
apple
blossoms
were
white
with
glimpses
of
lake
and
stream
here
and
there
through
woods
that
were
a
promise
of
the
wilderness
to
come
by
fields
so
thickly
studded
with
bowlders
that
one
to
plant
them
must
use
drill
and
dynamite
getting
my
first
impression
of
the
interior
of
nova
scotia
alone
then
at
last
came
a
church
a
scattering
string
of
houses
a
vista
of
lakes
a
neat
white
hotel
and
the
edge
of
the
wilderness
had
been
reached
on
the
hotel
steps
a
curious
hairy
figure
was
capering
about
doing
a
sort
of
savage
dance
perhaps
as
a
preparation
for
war
at
first
i
made
it
out
to
be
a
counterpart
of
pictures
i
had
seen
of
robinson
crusoe
on
his
desert
island
then
i
discovered
that
it
wore
wide
spectacles
and
these
in
the
fading
sunlight
sent
forth
a
familiar
glare
so
it
was
eddie
after
all
and
no
edged
tool
had
touched
hair
or
beard
since
april
i
understood
now
why
he
had
not
met
me
at
the
station

room
and

was
a
marvel
and
a
revelation
eddie
room
and
contents
with
eddie
in
the
midst
of
them
was
a
marvel
and
a
revelation
all
the
accouterments
of
former
expeditions
of
whatever
sort
all
that
he
had
bought
for
this
one
all
that
i
had
shipped
from
week
to
week
were
gathered
there
there
were
wading
boots
and
camp
boots
and
moccasins
and
dutch
and
shoepacks
the
a
sort
of
micmac
indian
cross
between
a
shoe
and
a
moccasin
much
affected
by
guides
who
keep
them
saturated
with
oil
and
wear
them
in
the
water
and
out
there
were
nets
of
various
sizes
and
sorts
from
large
minnow
nets
through
a
line
of
landing
nets
to
some
silk
head
nets
invented
and
made
by
eddie
himself
one
for
each
of
us
to
pull
on
day
or
night
when
the
insect
pests
were
bad
there
was
a
quantity
of
ointment
too
for
the
same
purpose
while
of
sovereign
remedies
balms
and
anodynes
for
ills
and
misfortunes
collection
was
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
soothing
lotions
there
were
for
wounds
new
and
old
easing
draughts
for

internal
and
external
magic
salves
such
as
were
used
by
the
knights
of

romance
amadis
de

and
others
for
the
instant
cure
of
ghastly
lacerations
made
by
man
or
beast
and
a
large
fresh
bottle
of
a
collodion
preparation
with
which
the

could
be
painted

or
in
general
and
stand
forth
at
last
good
as

bones
and
skin
in
addition
there
was
a
certain
bottle
of
the
fluid
extract
of
gelsemium
or
something
like
that
which
was
recommended
for
anything
that
the
rest
of
the
assortment
could
do
combined
it
was
said
to
be
good
for
everything
from
a
sore
throat
to
a
snake
bite
the
list
of
its
benefits
being
recorded
in
a
by
which
eddie
set
great
store
take
it
by
all
means
eddie
i
said
then
you
wo
need
any
of
the
others
that
settled
it
the
gelsemium
was
left
behind
i
was
interested
in
eddie
rods
leaning
here
and
there
on
various
parcels
about
the
room
i
found
that
the
new
noibwood
such
as
i
had
ordered
was
only
a
unit
in
a
very
respectable
aggregate
rather
an
unimportant
unit
it
appeared
by
this
time
for
eddie
calmly
assured
me
that
the
tip
had
remained
set
after
landing
a
rather
small
trout
in
a
nearby
stream
and
that
he
did
not
consider
the
wood
altogether
suitable
for
trout
rods
whereupon
i
was
moved
to
confess
the
little
bamboo
stick
i
had
bought
in
boston
and
produced
it
for
inspection
i
could
see
that
eddie
bristled
a
bit
as
i
uncased
it
and
i
think
viewed
it
and
wiggled
it
with
rather
small
respect
still
he
did
not
condemn
it
utterly
and
i
had
an
impulse
to
confess
the
other
things
the
impossible
little
flies
the
tin
whistle
and
the
jock
scott
with
two
hooks
however
it
did
not
seem
just
the
psychological
moment
and
i
refrained
as
for
eddie
flies
viewed
together
they
were
a
dazzling
lot
there
were
books
and
books
of
them
american
english
scotch
and
what
not
there
was
one
book
of
english
procured
during
a
recent
sojourn
abroad
to
be
tried
in
american
waters
one
does
not
dance
and
jiggle
a
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
life
of
some
unusual
creature
with
rainbow
wings
and
the
ability
to
wriggle
upstream
even
against
a
swift
current
the
is
built
to
resemble
life
itself
color
shape
and
all
and
is
cast
on
a
stream
where
a
trout
is
seen
to
rise
and
allowed
to
drift
with
the
gently
flowing
current
exactly
over
the
magic
spot
all
this
eddie
explained
to
me
and
let
me
hold
the
book
a
little
time
though
i
could
see
he
did
not
intend
to
let
me
use
one
of
the
precious
things
and
would
prefer
that
i
did
not
touch
them
he
was
packing
now
and
i
wandered
idly
about
this
uncatalogued
museum
of
sporting
goods
there
was
a
heap
of
canvas
and
blankets
in
one
corner
a
sleeping
bag
it
proved
with
an
infinite
number
of
compartments
or
layers
there
were
hats
of
many
shapes
vests
of
many
fabrics
coats
of
many
colors
there
were
things
i
had
seen
before
only
in
sporting
goods
windows
there
were
things
i
had
never
seen
before
anywhere
there
were
things
of
which
i
could
not
even
guess
the
use
in
the
center
of
everything
were
bags
canvas
and
receptacles
vigorously
named
tackle
bag
wardrobe
war
bag
and
the
like
and
into
these
the
contents
of
the
room
were
gradually
but
firmly
disappearing
taking
their
place
according
to
eddie
method
for
after
all
it
was
a
method
and
as
i
looked
at
eddie
unshaven
for
weeks
grizzled
and
glaring
yet
glowing
with
deep
kindliness
and
the
joy
of
anticipation
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
santa
claus
packing
for
his
annual
journey
that
magic
bag
which
holds
more
and
ever
more
and
is
so
deep
and
so
wide
in
its
beneficence
that
after
all
the
comforts
and
the
sweets
of
life
are
crowded
within
there
still
is
room
for
more
remembering
my
own
one
small
bag
which
i
had
planned
to
take
with
side
pockets
for
tackle
and
a
place
between
for
certain
changes
of
raiment
i
felt
my
unimportance
more
and
more
and
the
great
need
of
having
an
outfit
like
eddie
of
having
it
in
the
party
i
mean
handy
like
where
it
would
be
easy
to
get
hold
of
in
time
of
need
i
foresaw
that
clothes
would
want
mending
also
perhaps
rods
and
it
was
pleasant
to
note
that
my
would
have
boxes
of
tools
for
all
such
repairs
i
foresaw
too
that
i
should
burn
and
bruise
and
cut
myself
and
that
eddie
liniments
and
lotions
and
new
skin
would
come
in
handy
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
those
bags
would
be
almost
everything
that
human
heart
could
need
or
human
ills
require
and
when
we
went
below
where
del
and
charlie
our
appointed
guides
were
crowding
certain
other
bags
full
of
the
bulkier
stores
packages
cans
and
bottles
and
when
i
gazed
about
on
still
other
things
tents
boots
and
baskets
of
camp
furniture
i
had
a
sense
of
being
cared
for
though
i
could
not
but
wonder
how
two
small
canoes
were
going
to
float
all
that
provender
and
plunder
and
four
strong
men
chapter
five
away
to
the
heart
of
the
deep
unknown
the
trout
and
the
wild
moose
are
the
fire
burns
bright
and
tent
gleams
the
northern
chapter
five
it
was
possible
to
put
our
canoes
into
one
of
the
lakes
near
the
hotel
and
enter
the
wilderness
by
water
the
liverpool
chain
but
it
was
decided
to
load
boats
and
baggage
into
wagons
and
drive
through
the
woods
a
distance
of
some
seventeen
uneven
miles
striking
at
once
for
the
true
wilderness
where
the
larger
trout
were
said
to
dwell
and
the
over
sunday
fisherman
does
not
penetrate
then
for
a
day
or
two
we
would
follow
waters
and
portages
familiar
to
our
guides
after
which
we
would
be
on
the
borders
of
the
unknown
prepared
to
conquer
the
wilderness
with
an
assortment
of
fishing
rods
a
supply
of
mosquito
ointment
and
a
pair
of
caliber
rifles
these
being
our
only
guns
it
seems
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
we
expected
to
do
little
shooting
in
the
first
place
it
was
out
of
season
for
most
things
though
this
did
not
matter
so
much
for
eddie
had
in
some
manner
armed
himself
with
a
commission
from
the
british
museum
to
procure
specimens
dead
or
alive
and
this
amounted
to
a
permit
to
kill
and
skin
and
hence
to
eat
promiscuously
and
at
will
but
i
believe
as
a
party
we
were
averse
to
promiscuous
killing
besides
it
is
well
to
be
rather
nice
in
the
matter
of
special
permits
also
we
had
come
in
the
main
for
trout
and
exploration
it
was
agreed
between
us
that
even
if
it
were
possible
to
hit
anything
with
our
guns
we
would
not
kill
without
skinning
and
we
would
skin
without
eating
after
which
resolution
the
forest
things
probably
breathed
easier
for
it
was
a
fairly
safe
handicap
i
shall
not
soon
forget
that
morning
drive
to
jake
landing
at
the
head
of
lake
kedgeemakoogee
where
we
put
in
our
canoes
my
trip
on
the
train
along
the
coast
and
the
drive
through
farming
country
more
or
less
fertile
had
given
me
little
conception
of
this
sinister
land
and
barren
seared
by
a
hundred
forest
fires
whatever
of
green
timber
still
stands
is
likely
to
be
little
more
than
brush
above
it
rise
the
bare
gaunt
skeletons
of
dead
forests
bleached
with
age
yet
blackened
by
the
tongues
of
flame
that
burned
out
the
life
and
wealth
of
a
land
which
is
now
little
more
than
waste
and
desolation
the
haunt
of
the
moose
the
loon
and
the
porcupine
the
natural
home
of
the
wild
trout
it
is
true
that
long
ago
heavy
timber
was
cut
from
these
woods
but
the
wealth
thus
obtained
was
as
nothing
to
that
which
has
gone
up
in
conflagrations
started
by
the
careless
lumbermen
and
prospectors
and
hunters
of
a
later
day
such
timber
as
is
left
barely
pays
for
the
cutting
and
old
sluices
are
blocked
and
old
dams
falling
to
decay
no
tiller
of
the
soil
can
exist
in
these
woods
for
the
ground
is
heaped
and
drifted
and
windrowed
with
slabs
and
bowlders
suggesting
the
wreck
of
some
mighty
war
of
the
gods
some
titanic
combat
with
this
as
the
battle
ground
bleak
unsightly
unproductive
mangled
and
distorted
out
of
all
shape
and
form
of
loveliness
yet
with
a
fierce
wild
fascination
in
it
that
amounts
almost
to
beauty
that
is
the
nova
scotia
woods
only
the
water
is
not
like
that
once
on
the
stream
or
lake
and
all
is
changed
for
the
shores
are
green
the
river
or
brook
is
clear
and
cold
and
tarry
black
in
the
deep
places
the
water
leaps
and
dashes
in
whirlpools
and
torrents
and
the
lakes
are
fairy
lakes
full
of
green
islands
mere
ledges
many
of
them
with
two
or
three
curious
sentinel
pines
and
everywhere
the
same
clear
black
water
and
always
the
trout
the
wonderful
wild
abounding
nova
scotia
trout
to
jake
landing
was
a
hard
jolting
drive
over
a
bad
road
with
only
a
break
here
and
there
where
there
is
a
house
or
two
and
maybe
a
sawmill
and
a
the
last
sentinels
of
civilization
it
was
at
maitland
the
most
important
of
these
way
stations
that
we
met
loon
maitland
is
almost
a
village
an
old
settlement
in
fact
with
a
store
or
two
some
pretty
houses
and
a
mill
loon
is
a
dog
of
the
hound
variety
who
makes
his
home
there
and
a
dear
and
faithful
friend
of
eddie
by
the
latter
account
indeed
as
we
drew
near
maitland
after
announcing
that
he
would
wish
to
stop
at
the
maitland
stores
to
procure
some
new
things
he
had
thought
of
eddie
became
really
boastful
of
an
earlier
friendship
with
loon
he
had
met
loon
on
a
former
visit
during
his
loon
puppyhood
days
and
he
had
recorded
the
meeting
in
his
diary
wherein
loon
had
been
set
down
as
a
most
intelligent
and
affectionate
young
dog
he
produced
the
diary
now
as
evidence
and
i
could
see
that
our
guides
were
impressed
by
this
method
of
systematic
and
absolute
record
which
no
one
dare
dispute
he
proceeded
to
tell
us
all
he
knew
about
loon
and
how
glad
loon
would
be
to
see
him
again
until
we
were
all
jealous
that
no
intelligent
and
affectionate
hound
dog
was
waiting
for
us
at
maitland
to
sound
the
joy
of
welcome
and
to
speed
us
with
his
parting
bark
then
all
at
once
we
were
at
maitland
and
before
loon
home
and
sure
enough
there
in
the
front
yard
wagging
both
body
and
tail
stood
loon
it
took
but
one
glance
for
eddie
to
recognize
him
perhaps
it
took
no
more
than
that
for
loon
to
recognize
eddie
i
do
know
but
what
he
did
was
this
he
lifted
up
his
voice
as
one
mourning
for
a
lost
soul
and
uttered
such
a
series
of
wails
and
lamentations
as
only
a
hound
dog
in
the
deepest
sorrow
can
make
manifest
the
loon
bird
sends
a
fairly
unhappy
note
floating
down
the
wet
chill
loneliness
of
a
far
rainy
lake
but
never
can
the
most
forlorn
of
loons
hope
to
approach
his
canine
namesake
of
maitland
once
more
he
broke
out
into
a
burst
of
misery
then
suddenly
took
off
under
the
house
as
if
he
had
that
moment
remembered
an
appointment
there
and
feared
he
would
be
late
but
presently
he
looked
out
fearfully
enough
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
straight
on
eddie
set
up
still
another
of
those
protests
as
for
eddie
i
could
see
that
he
was
hurt
he
climbed
miserably
down
from
the
wagon
and
crept
gently
toward
the
sorrowing
hound
nice
loon
nice
good
loon
do
you
remember
me
followed
by
another
disappearance
under
the
house
come
loon
come
out
and
see
your
old
friend
that
a
good
dog
it
was
no
use
loon
sorrow
would
not
be
allayed
and
far
beyond
maitland
we
still
heard
him
wailing
it
down
the
wind
of
course
it
was
but
natural
that
we
should
discuss
the
matter
with
eddie
he
had
assured
us
that
dogs
never
forget
and
we
pressed
him
now
to
confess
what
extreme
cruelty
or
deceit
he
had
practiced
upon
loon
in
his
puppyhood
that
the
grown
hound
dog
had
remembered
and
reproached
him
for
but
for
the
most
part
eddie
remained
silent
and
seemed
depressed
neither
did
he
again
produce
his
diary
though
we
urged
him
to
do
so
in
order
that
he
might
once
more
read
to
us
what
he
had
recorded
of
loon
perhaps
something
had
been
overlooked
something
that
would
make
loon
lamentations
clear
i
think
we
were
all
glad
when
at
last
there
came
a
gleam
through
the
trees
and
we
were
at
jake
landing
where
our
boats
would
first
touch
the
water
where
we
would
break
our
bread
in
the
wilderness
for
the
first
time
illustration
eddie
produced
his
jug
of
fly
mixture
and
we
anointed
ourselves
for
the
first
time
putting
on
a
pungent
fragrance
it
was
not
much
of
a
place
to
camp
there
was
little
shade
a
good
deal
of
mud
and
the
sun
was
burning
hot
there
was
a
remnant
of
black
flies
too
and
an
advance
guard
of
mosquitoes
eddie
produced
his
jug
of
fly
mixture
and
we
anointed
ourselves
for
the
first
time
putting
on
a
pungent
fragrance
which
was
to
continue
a
part
of
us
body
and
bone
so
long
as
the
wilderness
remained
our
shelter
it
was
greasy
and
sticky
and
i
could
not
muster
an
instant
liking
for
the
combined
fragrance
of
camphor
pennyroyal
and
tar
but
eddie
assured
me
that
i
would
learn
to
love
it
and
i
was
willing
to
try
i
was
more
interested
in
the
loading
of
the
canoes
del
stout
of
muscle
and
figure
not
to
say
fat
at
least
not
over
fat
and
charlie
light
of
weight
and
heart
sometimes
known
as
charles
the
strong
were
packing
and
fitting
our
plunder
into
place
condensing
it
into
a
tight
and
solid
compass
in
the
center
of
our
canoes
in
a
way
that
commanded
my
respect
and
even
awe
i
could
see
however
that
when
our
craft
was
loaded
the
water
line
and
the
gunwale
were
not
so
far
apart
and
i
realized
that
one
would
want
to
sit
decently
still
in
a
craft
like
that
especially
in
rough
water
meantime
eddie
had
coupled
up
a
rod
and
standing
on
a
projecting
log
was
making
a
few
casts
i
assumed
that
he
was
merely
giving
us
an
exhibition
of
his
skill
in
throwing
a
fly
with
no
expectation
of
really
getting
a
rise
in
this
open
disturbed
place
it
was
fine
though
to
see
his
deft
handling
of
the
rod
and
i
confess
i
watched
him
with
something
of
envy
i
may
confess
too
that
my
own
experience
with
fly
casting
had
been
confined
to
tumbling
brooks
with
small
pools
and
overhanging
boughs
where
to
throw
a
fly
means
merely
to
drop
it
on
a
riffle
or
at
most
to
swing
it
out
over
a
swirling
current
below
a
fall
i
wondered
as
i
watched
eddie
if
i
ever
should
be
able
to
send
a
fly
sailing
backward
and
then
shoot
it
out
forward
a
matter
of
twenty
yards
or
so
with
that
almost
imperceptible
effort
of
the
wrist
and
even
if
i
did
learn
the
movement
if
i
could
manage
to
make
the
fly
look
real
enough
in
such
smooth
open
water
as
this
to
fool
even
the
blindest
and
silliest
of
trout
but
suddenly
where
eddie
fly
it
was
a
silver
doctor
i
think
fell
lightly
on
the
water
there
was
a
quick
swirl
a
flash
and
then
a
widening
circle
of
rings
you
got
him
comin
commented
charlie
who
it
seems
had
been
noticing
the
fly
went
skimming
out
over
the
water
again
and
softly
as
thistle
seed
settled
exactly
in
the
center
of
the
circling
rings
but
before
it
touched
almost
there
came
the
flash
and
break
again
and
this
time
there
followed
the
quick
stiffening
of
the
rod
a
sudden
tightening
of
the
line
and
a
sharp
keen
singing
of
the
reel
that
the
time
commented
charlie
and
reached
for
a
landing
net
to
him
it
was
as
nothing
a
thing
to
be
done
a
hundred
times
a
day
but
to
me
the
world
heaved
and
reeled
with
excitement
it
was
the
first
trout
of
the
expedition
the
first
trout
i
had
ever
seen
taken
in
such
water
probably
the
largest
trout
i
had
ever
seen
taken
in
any
water
in
the
tension
of
the
moment
i
held
my
breath
or
uttered
involuntary
comments
it
was
beautiful
to
see
eddie
handle
that
trout
the
water
was
open
and
smooth
and
there
is
no
gainsaying
eddie
skill
had
he
been
giving
an
exhibition
performance
it
could
not
have
been
more
perfect
there
was
no
eagerness
no
driving
and
dragging
no
wild
fear
of
the
fish
getting
away
the
curved
rod
the
taut
swaying
line
and
the
sensitive
hand
and
wrist
did
the
work
now
and
again
there
was
a
rush
and
the
reel
sang
as
it
gave
line
but
there
was
never
the
least
bit
of
slack
in
the
recover
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
still
unseen
captive
and
then
presently
our
fisherman
took
the
net
from
his
guide
there
was
a
little
dipping
movement
in
the
water
at
his
feet
and
the
first
trout
of
the
expedition
was
a
visible
fact
his
golden
belly
and
scarlet
markings
the
subject
of
admiration
and
comment
it
was
not
a
very
big
fish
by
nova
scotia
standards
about
of
a
pound
i
believe
but
it
was
the
largest
trout
i
had
ever
seen
alive
at
that
time
and
i
was
consumed
with
envy
i
was
also
rash
a
little
more
and
i
had
a
rod
up
was
out
on
a
log
engaged
in
a
faithful
effort
to
swing
that
rod
exactly
like
eddie
and
to
land
the
fly
precisely
in
the
same
place
but
for
some
reason
the
gear
would
work
in
front
of
me
the
fly
fell
everywhere
but
in
the
desired
spot
and
back
of
me
the
guides
dodged
and
got
behind
bushes
you
see
a
number
three
steel
hook
sailing
about
promiscuously
in
the
air
even
when
partially
concealed
in
a
fancy
bunch
of
feathers
is
a
thing
to
be
avoided
i
had
a
clear
field
in
no
time
but
perhaps
eddie
had
caught
the
only
fish
in
the
pool
for
even
he
could
get
no
more
rises
still
i
persisted
and
got
hot
and
fierce
and
when
i
looked
at
eddie
i
hated
him
because
he
did
cut
his
hair
and
reflected
bitterly
that
it
was
no
wonder
a
creature
like
that
could
fish
finally
i
hooked
a
tree
top
behind
me
and
in
jerking
the
fly
loose
made
a
misstep
and
went
up
to
my
waist
in
water
the
tension
broke
then
i
helped
to
break
it
and
the
fishing
trip
had
properly
begun
the
wagons
had
left
us
now
and
we
were
alone
with
our
canoes
and
our
guides
del
the
stout
who
was
to
have
my
especial
fortunes
in
hand
knelt
in
the
stern
of
the
larger
canoe
and
i
gingerly
entered
the
bow
then
eddie
and
his
guide
found
their
respective
places
in
the
lighter
craft
and
we
were
ready
to
move
a
moment
more
and
we
would
drop
down
the
stream
to
the
lake
and
so
set
out
on
our
long
journey
i
recall
now
that
i
was
hot
and
wet
and
still
a
little
cross
i
had
never
had
any
especial
enthusiasm
about
the
expedition
and
more
than
once
had
regretted
my
pledge
made
across
the
table
at
the
end
of
the
old
year
even
the
bustle
of
preparation
and
the
journey
into
a
strange
land
had
only
mildly
stirred
me
and
i
felt
now
that
for
me
at
least
things
were
likely
to
drag
there
were
many
duties
at
home
that
required
attention
these
woods
were
full
of
mosquitoes
probably
malaria
it
was
possible
that
i
should
take
cold
be
very
ill
and
catch
no
fish
whatever
but
then
suddenly
we
dropped
out
into
the
lake
kedgeemakoogee
the
lake
of
the
fairies
a
broad
expanse
of
black
water
dotted
with
green
islands
and
billowing
white
in
the
afternoon
wind
and
just
as
we
rounded
i
felt
a
sudden
tug
at
the
end
of
my
line
which
was
trailing
out
behind
the
canoe
in
an
instant
i
was
alive
del
cautioned
me
softly
from
the
stern
for
there
is
no
guide
who
does
not
wish
his
charge
to
acquit
himself
well
easy
now
easy
he
said
that
a
good
one
do
hurry
him
but
every
nerve
in
me
began
to
tingle
every
drop
of
blood
to
move
faster
i
was
eaten
with
a
wild
desire
to
drag
my
prize
into
the
boat
before
he
could
escape
then
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
line
must
be
fast
the
pull
was
so
strong
and
fixed
but
looking
out
behind
del
saw
the
water
break
just
then
a
sort
of
double
flash
good
you
got
a
pair
he
said
careful
now
and
we
save
both
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
no
hope
of
saving
either
and
if
i
was
careful
i
did
feel
so
when
i
let
the
line
go
out
as
i
was
obliged
to
now
and
then
to
keep
from
breaking
it
altogether
i
had
a
wild
hopeless
feeling
that
i
could
never
take
it
up
again
and
that
the
prize
was
just
that
much
farther
away
whenever
there
came
a
sudden
slackening
i
was
sickened
with
a
fear
that
the
fish
were
gone
and
ground
the
reel
handle
feverishly
fifty
yards
away
the
other
canoe
with
eddie
in
the
bow
had
struck
nothing
as
yet
and
if
i
could
land
these
two
i
should
be
one
ahead
on
the
score
it
seems
now
a
puny
ambition
but
it
was
vital
then
i
was
no
longer
cold
or
hot
or
afraid
of
malaria
or
mosquitoes
or
anything
of
the
sort
duties
more
or
less
important
at
home
were
forgotten
i
was
concerned
only
with
those
two
trout
that
had
fastened
to
my
flies
the
silver
doctor
and
the
parmcheenie
belle
out
there
in
the
black
tossing
water
and
with
the
proper
method
of
keeping
my
line
taut
but
not
too
taut
easy
but
not
too
easy
with
working
the
prize
little
by
little
within
reach
of
the
net
eddie
suddenly
seeing
my
employment
called
across
congratulations
and
encouragement
then
immediately
he
was
busy
too
with
a
fish
of
his
own
and
the
sport
the
great
splendid
sport
of
the
far
north
woods
had
really
begun
i
brought
my
catch
near
the
boatside
at
last
but
it
is
no
trifling
matter
to
get
two
trout
into
a
net
when
they
are
strung
out
on
a
leader
with
the
big
trout
on
the
top
fly
reason
dictates
that
the
end
trout
should
go
in
first
and
at
least
twice
i
had
him
in
when
the
big
fellow
at
the
top
gave
a
kick
that
landed
both
outside
it
a
mercy
i
did
not
lose
both
but
at
last
with
a
lucky
hitch
they
were
duly
netted
in
the
canoe
and
i
was
weak
and
hysterical
but
triumphant
there
was
one
of
nearly
a
pound
and
a
half
and
the
other
a
strong
not
guess
weight
but
by
eddie
scales
which
i
confess
i
thought
niggardly
never
had
i
taken
such
fish
in
the
adirondack
or
berkshire
streams
i
had
known
and
what
was
more
these
were
two
at
a
time
eddie
had
landed
a
fine
trout
also
and
we
drew
alongside
now
for
consultation
the
wind
had
freshened
the
waves
were
running
higher
and
with
our
heavy
canoes
the
paddle
across
would
be
a
risky
undertaking
why
not
pitch
our
first
night
camp
nearby
here
on
jim
charles
point
a
beautiful
spot
where
once
long
ago
a
indian
had
made
his
home
in
this
cove
before
dark
we
could
do
abundant
fishing
for
me
there
was
no
other
plan
i
was
all
enthusiasm
now
there
were
trout
here
and
i
could
catch
them
that
was
enough
civilization
the
world
flesh
and
the
devil
mankind
and
all
the
duties
of
life
were
as
nothing
here
were
the
woods
and
the
waters
there
was
the
point
for
the
campfire
and
the
tents
about
us
were
the
leaping
trout
the
spell
of
the
forest
and
the
chase
gripped
me
body
and
soul
only
these
things
were
worth
while
nothing
else
mattered
nothing
else
existed
we
landed
and
in
a
little
while
the
tents
were
white
on
the
shore
del
and
charlie
getting
them
up
as
if
by
conjury
then
once
more
we
were
out
in
the
canoes
and
the
curved
rod
and
the
taut
line
and
the
singing
reel
dominated
every
other
force
under
the
wide
sky
it
was
not
the
truest
sport
maybe
for
the
fish
were
chiefly
taken
with
trolling
flies
but
to
me
then
it
did
not
matter
suffice
it
that
they
were
fine
and
plentiful
and
that
i
was
two
ahead
of
eddie
when
at
last
we
drew
in
for
supper
that
was
joy
enough
and
then
such
trout
for
there
are
no
trout
on
earth
like
those
one
catches
himself
such
a
campfire
such
a
cozy
tent
eddie
it
was
from
one
of
the
catalogues
with
the
guides
tent
facing
and
the
fire
between
for
us
there
was
no
world
beyond
that
circle
of
light
that
on
one
side
glinted
among
boughs
of
spruce
and
cedar
and
maple
and
birch
and
on
the
other
gleamed
out
on
the
black
water
lying
back
on
our
beds
and
smoking
and
looking
at
the
fire
and
the
smoke
curling
up
among
the
dark
branches
toward
the
stars
and
remembering
the
afternoon
sport
and
all
the
other
afternoons
and
mornings
and
nights
still
to
come
i
was
moved
with
a
deep
sense
of
gratitude
in
my
heart
toward
eddie
eddie
i
murmured
i
forgive
you
all
those
lists
and
everything
even
your
hair

begin
to
understand
now
something
of
how
you
feel
about
the
woods
and
the
water
and
all
next
time
then
for
it
was
the
proper
moment

chapter
six
the
fire
the
shadows
creep
brands
burn
dim
and
red
the
pillow
of
sleep
lies
soft
and
a
weary
chapter
six
when
one
has
been
accustomed
to
the
comforts
of
civilized
life
the
small
ones
i
mean
for
they
are
the
only
ones
that
count
the
beginning
of
a
wild
free
life
near
to
nature
heart
begets
a
series
of
impressions
quite
new
and
strange
so
strange
it
is
not
that
one
misses
a
house
of
solid
walls
and
roof
with
stairways
and
steam
radiators
these
are
the
larger
comforts
and
are
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
sheltering
temple
of
the
trees
the
blazing
campfire
and
the
stairway
leading
to
the
stars
but
there
are
things
that
one
does
miss
a
little
just
at
first
when
we
had
finished
our
first
smoke
and
the
campfire
was
burning
low
when
there
was
nothing
further
to
do
but
go
to
bed
i
suddenly
realized
that
the
man
who
said
he
would
be
willing
to
do
without
all
the
rest
of
a
house
if
he
could
keep
the
bathroom
spoke
as
one
with
an
inspired
knowledge
of
human
needs
i
would
not
suggest
that
i
am
a
person
given
to
luxurious
habits
and
vain
details
in
the
matter
of
evening
toilet
but
there
are
so
many
things
one
is
in
the
habit
of
doing
just
about
bedtime
which
in
a
bathroom
with
its
varied
small
conveniences
seem
nothing
at
all
yet
which
assume
undue
proportions
in
the
deep
dim
heart
of
nature
where
only
the
large
primitive
comforts
have
been
provided
i
had
never
been
in
the
habit
for
instance
of
stumbling
through
several
rods
of
bushes
and
tangled
vines
to
get
to
a
that
was
four
miles
wide
and
six
miles
long
and
full
of
islands
and
trout
and
maybe
snapping
turtles
i
know
there
were
snapping
turtles
for
charlie
had
been
afraid
to
leave
his
shoepacks
on
the
beach
for
fear
the
turtles
would
carry
them
off
and
i
had
not
for
many
years
known
what
it
was
to
bathe
my
face
on
a
ground
level
or
to
brush
my
teeth
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
it
was
all
new
and
strange
as
i
have
said
and
there
was
no
hot
water
not
even
a
faucet
that
did
run
maybe
because
the
man
upstairs
was
using
it
there
was
any
upstairs
except
the
treetops
and
the
sky
though
after
all
these
made
up
for
a
good
deal
for
the
treetops
feathered
up
and
faded
into
the
dusky
blue
and
the
blue
was
sown
with
stars
that
were
caught
up
and
multiplied
by
every
tiny
wrinkle
on
the
surface
of
the
great
black
bowl
and
sent
in
myriad
twinklings
to
our
feet
still
i
would
have
exchanged
the
stars
for
a
few
minutes
for
a
power
electric
light
or
even
for
a
single
gas
jet
with
such
gas
as
one
gets
when
the
companies
combine
and
establish
a
uniform
rate
i
had
mislaid
my
tube
of
dentifrice
and
in
the
dim
pale
starlight
i
pawed
around
and
murmured
to
myself
a
good
while
before
i
finally
called
eddie
to
help
me
oh
let
it
go
he
said
it
be
there
for
you
in
the
morning
i
always
leave
mine
and
my
soap
and
towel
too
he
threw
his
towel
over
a
limb
laid
his
soap
on
a
log
and
faced
toward
the
camp
i
hesitated
i
was
unused
to
leaving
my
things
out
overnight
my
custom
was
to
hang
my
towel
neatly
over
a
rack
to
stand
my
toothbrush
upright
in
a
glass
on
a
little
shelf
with
the
dentifrice
beside
it
habit
is
strong
i
did
not
immediately
consent
to
this
wide
and
gaudy
freedom
of
the
woods
suppose
it
rains
i
said
all
the
better
it
will
wash
the
towels
but
they
will
be
wet
in
the
morning
um
yes
in
the
woods
things
generally
are
wet
in
the
morning
get
used
to
that
it
is
likewise
my
habit
to
comb
my
hair
before
retiring
and
to
look
at
myself
in
the
glass
meantime
this
may
be
due
to
vanity
it
may
be
a
sort
of
general
inspection
to
see
if
i
have
added
any
new
features
or
lost
any
of
those
plucked
from
the
family
tree
perhaps
it
is
only
to
observe
what
the
day
burdens
have
done
for
me
in
the
way
of
wrinkles
and
gray
hairs
never
mind
the
reason
it
is
a
habit
but
i
realize
how
precious
it
was
to
me
until
i
got
back
to
the
tent
and
found
that
our
only
mirror
was
in
eddie
collection
set
in
the
back
of
a
combination
affair
about
the
size
of
one
thumb
of
course
it
was
not
at
all
adequate
for
anything
like
a
general
inspection
it
would
just
about
hold
one
eye
or
a
part
of
a
mouth
or
a
section
of
a
nose
or
a
piece
of
an
ear
or
a
little
patch
of
hair
and
it
kept
you
busy
guessing
where
that
patch
was
located
furthermore
as
the
comb
was
a
part
of
the
combination
the
little
mirror
was
obliged
to
be
twinkling
around
over
one
head
at
the
precise
moment
when
it
should
have
been
reflecting
some
portion
of
one
features
it
served
no
useful
purpose
thus
and
was
not
much
better
when
i
looked
up
another
comb
and
tried
to
use
it
in
the
natural
way
held
close
and
far
off
twisted
and
turned
it
was
no
better
i
felt
lost
and
disturbed
as
one
always
does
when
suddenly
deprived
of
the
exercise
of
an
old
and
dear
habit
and
i
began
to
make
mental
notes
of
some
things
i
should
bring
on
the
next
trip
there
was
still
a
good
deal
to
do
still
a
number
of
small
but
precious
conveniences
to
be
found
wanting
eddie
noticed
that
i
was
getting
into
action
and
said
he
would
stay
outside
while
i
was
stowing
myself
away
which
was
good
of
him
for
i
needed
the
room
when
i
began
to
take
on
things
i
found
i
needed
his
bed
too
to
put
them
on
i
suppose
i
had
expected
there
would
be
places
to
hang
them
i
am
said
to
be
rather
and
i
believe
i
stood
for
several
minutes
with
some
sort
of
a
garment
in
my
hand
turning
thoughtfully
one
way
and
another
probably
expecting
a
hook
to
come
drifting
somewhere
within
reach
yes
hooks
are
one
of
the
small
priceless
conveniences
and
is
another
i
never
suspected
that
the
space
under
the
bed
could
be
a
luxury
until
i
began
to
look
for
a
place
to
put
my
shoes
and
handbag
our
tent
was
just
long
enough
for
our
and
just
about
wide
enough
for
them
one
along
each
side
with
a
narrow
footway
between
they
were
laid
on
canvas
stretchers
which
had
poles
through
wide
hems
down
the
sides
the
ends
of
these
poles
cut
at
each
camp
and
selected
for
strength
and
springiness
spread
apart
and
tacked
to
larger
cross
poles
which
arrangement
raised
us
just
clear
of
the
ground
leaving
no
space
for
anything
of
consequence
underneath
you
could
hardly
put
a
fishing
rod
there
or
a
pipe
without
discomfort
to
the
flesh
and
danger
to
the
articles
undressing
and
bestowing
oneself
in
an
upper
berth
is
attended
with
problems
but
the
berth
is
not
so
narrow
and
it
is
flat
and
solid
and
there
are
hooks
and
little
hammocks
and
things
valuable
advantages
now
fondly
recalled
i
finally
piled
everything
on
bed
temporarily
i
did
know
what
i
was
going
to
do
with
it
next
but
anything
was
a
boon
for
the
moment
just
then
eddie
looked
in
that
your
pillow
material
you
know
he
said
pointing
to
my
medley
of
garments
you
want
a
pillow
do
you
sure
enough
i
had
no
pillow
and
i
did
want
one
i
always
want
a
pillow
and
a
high
one
it
is
another
habit
let
me
show
you
he
said
so
he
took
my
shoes
and
placed
them
one
on
each
side
of
my
couch
about
where
a
pillow
should
be
with
the
soles
out
making
each
serve
as
a
sort
of
retaining
wall
then
he
began
to
double
and
fold
and
fill
the
hollow
between
taking
the
bunchy
seamy
things
first
and
topping
off
with
the
softer
smoother
garments
in
a
deft
workmanlike
way
i
was
even
moved
to
add
other
things
from
my
bag
to
make
it
higher
and
smoother
now
put
your
bag
on
the
behind
your
pillow
and
let
it
lean
back
against
the
tent
it
will
stay
there
and
make
a
sort
of
head
to
your
bed
besides
being
handy
in
case
you
want
to
get
at
it
in
the
night
why
it
was
as
simple
and
easy
as
nothing
my
admiration
for
eddie
grew
i
said
i
would
get
into
my
couch
at
once
in
order
that
he
might
distribute
himself
likewise
but
this
was
not
so
easy
i
had
never
got
into
a
before
and
it
is
a
thing
that
requires
a
little
practice
to
do
it
with
skill
and
grace
it
has
to
be
done
section
at
a
time
and
one
night
garment
must
be
worked
down
in
order
that
it
may
not
become
merely
a
stuffy
thing
under
one
arms
to
a
beginner
this
is
slow
warm
work
by
the
time
i
was
properly
down
among
the
coarse
new
blankets
and
had
permeated
the
remotest
corners
of
the
clinging
envelope
i
had
had
a
lot
of
hard
exercise
and
was
hot
and
thirsty
so
del
brought
me
a
drink
of
water
i
was
used
to
being
waited
on
in
that
way
but
it
was
pleasant
after
all
there
were
some
conveniences
of
camp
life
that
were
worth
while
and
the
bed
was
comfortable
and
the
pillow
felt
good
i
lay
watching
eddie
shape
his
things
about
all
his
bags
and
trappings
falling
naturally
into
the
places
they
were
to
occupy
through
the
coming
weeks
the
bag
with
the
apothecary
stores
and
other
urgency
articles
went
at
the
upper
end
of
the
little
footway
and
made
a
sort
of
table
between
our
beds
another
bag
went
behind
his
pillow
which
he
made
as
he
had
made
mine
though
he
topped
it
off
with
a
little
rubber
affair
which
he
inflated
while
i
made
another
mental
memorandum
for
next
year
a
third
bag
but
i
did
not
see
the
fate
of
the
third
bag
a
haze
drifted
in
between
me
and
the
busy
little
figure
that
was
placing
and
pulling
and
folding
and
arranging
humming
a
soothing
ditty
meantime
and
i
was
swept
up
bodily
into
a
cloud
of
sleep
chapter
seven
dawn
her
gray
green
mantle
the
lilt
of
a
low
refrain
drip
drip
drip
of
the
lush
green
a
night
of
chapter
seven
the
night
was
fairly
uneventful
once
i
imagined
i
heard
something
smelling
around
the
camp
and
i
remember
having
a
sleepy
curiosity
as
to
the
size
and
manner
of
the
beast
and
whether
he
meant
to
eat
us
and
where
he
would
be
likely
to
begin
i
may
say
too
that
i
found
some
difficulty
in
turning
over
in
my
and
that
it
did
rain
i
do
know
what
hour
it
was
when
i
was
awakened
by
the
soft
thudding
drops
just
above
my
nose
but
i
remember
that
i
was
glad
for
there
had
been
fires
in
the
woods
and
the
streams
were
said
to
be
low
i
satisfied
myself
that
eddie
patent
guaranteed
perfectly
waterproof
tent
was
not
leaking
unduly
and
wriggling
into
a
new
position
slept
it
was
dull
daylight
when
i
awoke
through
the
slit
in
the
tent
i
could
see
the
rain
drizzling
on
the
dead
campfire
eddie
long
a
guest
of
the
forest
lost
now
in
the
multiple
folds
of
his
had
not
stirred
a
glimpse
of
the
guides
tent
opposite
revealed
that
the
flap
was
still
tightly
drawn
there
was
no
voice
or
stir
of
any
living
creature
only
the
feet
of
the
rain
went
padding
among
the
leaves
and
over
the
tent
now
i
am
not
especially
given
to
lying
in
bed
and
on
this
particular
morning
any
such
inclination
was
rather
less
manifest
than
usual
i
wanted
to
spread
myself
out
to
be
able
to
move
my
arms
away
from
my
body
to
whirl
around
and
twist
and
revolve
a
bit
without
so
much
careful
preparation
and
deliberate
movement
yet
there
was
very
little
to
encourage
one
to
get
up
our
campfire
so
late
a
glory
and
an
inspiration
had
become
a
remnant
of
black
ends
and
soggy
ash
i
was
not
overhot
as
i
lay
and
i
had
a
conviction
that
i
should
be
less
so
outside
the
provided
always
that
i
could
extricate
myself
from
that
somewhat
clinging
confining
envelope
neither
was
there
any
immediate
prospect
of
breakfast
nobody
to
talk
to
no
place
to
go
i
had
an
impulse
to
arouse
eddie
for
the
former
purpose
but
there
was
something
about
that
heap
of
canvas
and
blankets
across
the
way
that
looked
dangerous
i
had
never
seen
him
roused
in
his
forest
lair
and
i
suspected
that
he
would
be
savage
i
concluded
to
proceed
cautiously
in
some
manner
which
might
lead
him
to
believe
that
the
fall
of
a
drifting
leaf
or
the
note
of
a
bird
had
been
his
summons
i
worked
one
arm
free
and
reaching
out
for
one
of
my
shoes
a
delicate
affair
with
the
soles
filled
with
splices
for
clambering
over
the
rocks
i
tossed
it
as
neatly
as
possible
at
the
irregular
bunch
opposite
aiming
a
trifle
high
it
fell
with
a
solid
sickening
thud
and
i
shrank
down
into
my
bag
expecting
an
eruption
none
came
then
i
was
seized
with
the
fear
that
i
had
killed
or
maimed
eddie
it
seemed
necessary
to
investigate
i
took
better
aim
this
time
and
let
go
with
the
other
shoe
eddie
i
yelled
are
you
dead
there
was
a
stir
this
time
and
a
deep
growl
it
seemed
to
take
the
form
of
words
at
length
and
i
caught
or
fancied
i
did
the
query
as
to
what
time
it
was
whereupon
i
laboriously
fished
up
my
watch
and
announced
in
clear
tones
that
the
hand
was
upon
the
stroke
of
six
also
that
it
was
high
time
for
children
of
the
forest
to
bestir
themselves
at
this
there
was
another
and
a
deeper
growl
ending
with
a
single
syllable
of
ominous
sound
i
could
not
be
sure
but
heard
through
the
folds
of
a
the
word
sounded
a
good
deal
like
hell
and
i
had
a
dim
conviction
that
he
was
sending
me
there
perhaps
realizing
that
i
was
cold
then
he
became
unconscious
again
and
i
had
no
more
shoes
yet
my
efforts
had
not
been
without
effect
there
was
a
nondescript
stir
in
the
guides
tent
and
presently
the
head
of
charles
sometimes
called
the
strong
protruded
a
little
and
was
withdrawn
then
that
of
del
the
stout
appeared
and
a
little
later
two
extraordinary
figures
issued
wordless
and
still
rocking
a
little
with
sleep
and
with
that
deliberate
precision
born
of
long
experience
went
drabbling
after
fuel
and
water
that
the
morning
fire
might
kindle
and
the
morning
pot
be
made
to
boil
they
were
clad
in
oilskins
and
the
drapery
of
charles
deserves
special
attention
it
is
likely
that
its
original
color
had
been
a
flaunt
of
yellow
and
that
it
had
been
bedizened
with
certain
buttonholes
and
hems
and
selvages
and
things
such
as
adorn
garments
in
a
general
way
of
whatever
nature
or
sex
that
must
have
been
a
long
time
ago
it
is
improbable
that
the
oldest
living
inhabitant
would
be
able
to
testify
concerning
these
items
observing
him
thoughtfully
as
he
bent
over
the
wet
ashes
and
skillfully
cut
and
split
and
presently
brought
to
flame
the
little
heap
of
wood
he
had
garnered
there
grew
upon
me
a
realization
of
the
vast
service
that
suit
of
oilskins
must
have
rendered
to
its
owners
of
the
countless
storms
that
had
beaten
upon
it
of
the
untold
fires
that
had
been
kindled
under
its
protection
of
the
dark
wild
nights
when
it
had
served
in
fording
torrents
and
in
clambering
over
slippery
rocks
indeed
of
all
the
ages
of
wear
and
tear
that
had
eaten
into
its
seams
and
selvages
and
hues
since
the
day
when
noah
first
brought
it
out
of
the
ark
and
started
it
down
through
the
several
generations
which
had
ended
with
our
faithful
charles
the
strong
i
suppose
this
is
just
one
of
those
profitless
reflections
which
is
likely
to
come
along
when
one
is
still
tangled
up
in
a
watching
the
tiny
flame
that
grows
a
little
brighter
and
bigger
each
moment
and
forces
at
last
a
glow
of
comfort
into
the
tent
until
the
day
after
all
seems
worth
beginning
though
the
impulse
to
begin
it
is
likely
to
have
diminished
i
have
known
men
awake
for
a
long
time
who
have
gone
on
to
sleep
during
just
such
morning
speculations
when
the
flames
grew
bright
and
brighter
and
crackled
up
through
the
little
heap
of
dry
branches
and
sent
that
glow
of
luxury
into
the
tent
i
remember
seeing
our
guide
adjust
a
stick
at
an
angle
above
the
fire
whereby
to
suspend
a
kettle
and
men
suddenly
of
being
startled
from
somewhere
i
was
at
the
club
i
think
in
the
midst
of
a
game
of
pool
by
a
wild
whoop
and
the
spectacle
of
eddie
standing
upright
in
the
little
runway
between
our
beds
howling
that
the
proper
moment
for
bathing
had
arrived
and
kicking
up
what
seemed
to
me
a
great
and
unnecessary
stir
illustration
not
to
take
the
morning
dip
was
to
manifest
a
sad
lack
of
the
true
camping
spirit
the
idea
of
bathing
on
such
a
morning
and
in
that
primitive
costume
had
not
i
think
occurred
to
me
before
but
i
saw
presently
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
a
little
later
i
was
following
eddie
cringing
from
the
cold
pelting
rain
limping
gingerly
over
sharp
sticks
and
pebbles
to
the
water
edge
the
lake
was
shallow
near
the
shore
which
meant
a
fearful
period
of
wading
before
taking
the
baptismal
plunge
that
would
restore
one
general
equilibrium
it
required
courage
too
for
the
water
was
icy
courage
to
wade
out
to
the
place
and
once
there
to
make
the
plunge
i
should
never
have
done
it
if
eddie
had
not
insisted
that
according
to
the
standard
the
day
in
every
camp
always
began
with
this
ceremony
not
to
take
the
morning
dip
he
said
was
to
manifest
a
sad
lack
of
the
true
camping
spirit
thus
prodded
i
bade
the
world
a
hasty
and
headed
for
the
bottom
a
moment
later
we
were
splashing
and
puffing
like
seals
shouting
with
the
fierce
delightful
torture
of
it
wide
awake
enough
now
and
marvelously
invigorated
when
all
was
over
illustration
catching
it
in
the
skillet
as
it
fell
compelled
admiration
we
were
off
after
breakfast
a
breakfast
of
trout
and
flapjacks
the
latter
with
maple
sirup
in
the
little
eating
tent
the
flapjacks
were
del
manufacture
and
his
manner
of
tossing
the
final
large
one
into
the
air
and
catching
it
in
the
skillet
as
it
fell
compelled
admiration
the
lake
was
fairly
smooth
and
the
rain
no
longer
fell
a
gray
morning
the
surface
of
the
water
gray
a
gray
mantle
around
the
more
distant
of
the
islands
with
here
and
there
sharp
rocks
rising
just
above
the
depths
it
was
all
familiar
enough
to
the
guides
but
to
me
it
was
a
new
world
seated
in
the
bow
i
swung
my
paddle
joyously
and
even
with
our
weighty
load
it
seemed
that
we
barely
touched
the
water
one
must
look
out
for
the
rocks
though
for
a
sharp
point
plunged
through
the
bottom
of
a
canoe
might
mean
shipwreck
a
few
yards
away
eddie
and
his
guide
bodies
both
of
them
kept
abreast
their
appearance
somehow
suggesting
two
grasshoppers
on
a
straw
it
is
six
miles
across
kedgeemakoogee
and
during
the
passage
it
rained
when
we
were
about
over
i
felt
a
drop
or
two
strike
me
and
saw
the
water
about
the
canoe
spring
up
into
little
soldiers
a
moment
later
we
were
struck
on
every
side
and
the
water
soldiers
were
dancing
in
a
multitude
then
they
mingled
and
rushed
together
the
green
islands
were
blotted
out
the
gates
of
the
sky
swung
wide
illustration
to
put
on
a
pair
of
waders
like
that
in
the
front
end
of
a
canoe
in
a
pouring
rain
is
no
light
matter
of
course
it
was
necessary
to
readjust
matters
del
drew
on
his
oilskins
and
i
reached
for
my
own
i
had
a
short
coat
a
and
a
pair
of
heavy
brown
waders
so
tall
that
they
came
up
under
my
arms
when
fully
adjusted
there
was
no
special
difficulty
in
getting
on
the
hat
and
coat
but
to
put
on
a
pair
of
waders
like
that
in
the
front
end
of
a
canoe
in
a
pouring
rain
is
no
light
matter
there
seemed
no
good
place
to
straighten
my
legs
out
in
order
to
get
a
proper
pull
to
stand
up
was
to
court
destruction
and
when
i
made
an
attempt
to
put
a
leg
over
the
side
of
the
canoe
del
admonished
me
fearfully
that
another
such
move
would
send
us
to
the
bottom
forthwith
once
my
thumbs
pulled
out
of
the
straps
and
i
tumbled
back
on
the
stores
the
rain
beating
down
in
my
face
i
suppose
the
suddenness
of
the
movement
disturbed
the
balance
of
the
boat
somewhat
for
del
let
out
a
yell
that
awoke
a
loon
who
replied
dismally
when
at
last
i
had
the
feet
on
i
could
not
get
the
tops
in
place
for
of
course
there
was
no
way
to
get
them
anywhere
near
where
they
really
belonged
without
standing
up
so
i
had
to
remain
in
that
and
condition
far
from
comfortable
but
more
or
less
immune
to
wet
i
realized
what
a
sight
i
must
look
and
i
could
hardly
blame
eddie
for
howling
in
derision
at
me
when
he
drew
near
enough
to
distinguish
my
outline
through
the
downpour
i
also
realized
what
a
poor
rig
i
had
on
for
swimming
in
event
of
our
really
capsizing
and
i
sat
straight
and
still
and
paddled
hard
for
the
other
side
it
was
not
what
might
be
termed
a
prolonged
and
continuous
downpour
the
gray
veil
lifted
from
the
islands
the
myriad
of
battling
soldiers
diminished
presently
only
a
corporal
guard
was
leaping
and
dancing
about
the
canoe
then
these
disappeared
the
clouds
broke
away
the
sun
came
ahead
of
us
was
a
green
shore
the
other
side
of
kedgeemakoogee
had
been
reached
chapter
eight
the
trail
leads
back
from
the
water
edge
and
overgrown
your
load
and
strike
the
the
deep
chapter
eight
we
were
at
the
beginning
of
our
first
carry
now
a
stretch
of
about
two
miles
through
the
woods
the
canoes
were
quickly
unloaded
and
as
i
looked
more
carefully
at
the
various
bags
and
baskets
of
supplies
i
realized
that
they
were
constructed
with
a
view
of
being
connected
with
a
man
back
i
had
heard
and
read
a
good
deal
about
portages
and
i
realized
in
a
general
way
that
the
canoes
had
to
be
carried
from
one
water
system
to
another
but
somehow
i
had
never
considered
the
baggage
naturally
i
did
not
expect
it
to
get
over
of
its
own
accord
and
when
i
came
to
consider
the
matter
i
realized
that
a
man
back
was
about
the
only
place
where
it
could
ride
handily
and
with
reasonable
safety
i
also
realized
that
a
guide
life
is
not
altogether
a
holiday
excursion
i
felt
sorry
for
the
guides
i
even
suggested
to
eddie
that
he
carry
a
good
many
of
the
things
i
pointed
out
that
most
of
them
were
really
his
anyway
and
that
it
was
too
bad
to
make
our
faithful
retainers
lug
a
drug
store
and
sporting
goods
establishment
besides
the
greater
part
of
a
provision
warehouse
eddie
sympathized
with
the
guides
too
he
was
really
quite
pathetic
in
his
compassion
for
them
but
he
did
carry
any
of
the
things
that
is
any
of
those
things
it
is
the
etiquette
of
portage
of
nova
scotia
portage
at
least
that
the
fisherman
shall
carry
his
own
sporting
paraphernalia
which
is
to
say
his
rods
his
gun
if
he
has
one
his
fishing
basket
and
his
landing
net
also
perhaps
any
convenient
bag
of
tackle
or
apparel
when
not
too
great
an
inconvenience
it
is
the
business
of
the
guides
to
transport
the
canoes
the
general
outfit
and
the
stores
as
this
was
to
be
rather
a
long
carry
and
as
more
than
one
trip
would
be
necessary
it
was
proposed
to
make
a
station
for
luncheon
at
a
point
where
a
brook
cut
the
trail
but
our
procession
did
not
move
immediately
in
the
first
place
one
of
the
canoes
appeared
to
have
sprung
a
leak
and
after
our
paddle
this
seemed
a
proper
opportunity
to
rest
and
repair
damages
the
bark
craft
was
hauled
out
a
small
fire
scraped
together
and
the
pitch
pot
heated
while
the
guides
pawed
and
squinted
about
the
boat
bottom
to
find
the
perforation
meantime
i
tried
a
few
casts
in
the
lake
from
a
slanting
rock
and
finally
slipped
in
as
was
my
custom
then
we
found
that
we
did
not
wish
to
wait
until
reaching
the
brook
before
having
at
least
a
bite
and
sup
it
was
marshy
and
weedy
where
we
were
and
no
inviting
place
to
serve
food
but
we
were
tolerably
wet
and
we
had
paddled
a
good
way
we
got
out
a
can
of
corned
beef
and
a
loaf
of
bread
and
stood
around
in
the
ooze
and
cut
off
chunks
and
chewed
and
gulped
and
worked
them
down
into
place
then
we
said
we
were
ready
and
began
to
load
up
i
experimented
by
hanging
such
things
as
landing
nets
and
a
on
my
various
projections
while
my
hands
were
to
be
occupied
with
my
gun
and
a
the
things
were
not
especially
heavy
but
they
were
shifty
i
foresaw
that
the
would
work
around
under
my
arm
and
get
in
the
way
of
my
feet
and
that
the
landing
nets
would
complicate
matters
i
tied
them
all
in
a
solid
bunch
at
last
with
the
gun
inside
this
simplified
the
problem
a
good
deal
and
was
an
arrangement
for
which
i
had
reason
to
be
thankful
it
was
interesting
to
see
our
guides
load
up
charles
the
strong
had
been
well
named
he
swung
a
huge
basket
on
his
back
his
arms
through
straps
somewhat
like
those
which
support
an
evening
gown
and
of
this
other
paraphernalia
was
piled
i
have
seen
pack
burros
in
mexico
that
were
lost
sight
of
under
their
many
burdens
and
i
remembered
them
now
as
our
guides
stood
forth
ready
to
move
i
still
felt
sorry
for
them
the
guides
of
course
and
suggested
once
more
to
eddie
that
he
should
assume
some
of
their
burdens
in
fact
i
was
almost
willing
to
do
so
myself
and
when
at
the
last
moment
both
charlie
and
del
stooped
and
took
bundles
in
each
hand
i
was
really
on
the
very
point
of
offering
to
carry
something
only
there
was
nothing
more
to
carry
but
the
canoes
and
of
course
they
had
to
be
left
for
the
next
trip
i
was
glad
though
of
the
generous
impulse
on
my
part
there
is
always
comfort
in
such
things
eddie
and
i
set
out
ahead
there
is
something
fine
and
inspiring
about
a
portage
in
the
first
place
it
is
likely
to
be
through
a
deep
wood
over
a
trail
not
altogether
easy
to
follow
then
there
is
the
fascinating
thought
that
you
are
cutting
loose
another
link
from
everyday
mankind
pushing
a
chapter
deeper
into
the
wilderness
where
only
the
more
adventurous
ever
come
also
there
is
the
romantic
gipsy
feeling
of
having
possessions
in
such
compass
that
not
only
the
supplies
themselves
but
the
very
means
of
transportation
may
be
bodily
lifted
and
borne
from
one
water
link
to
another
of
that
chain
which
leads
back
ever
farther
into
the
unknown
i
have
suggested
that
a
portage
trail
is
not
always
easy
to
follow
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
chances
are
that
it
will
seldom
be
easy
to
follow
it
will
seldom
be
a
path
fit
for
human
beings
it
wo
be
even
a
decent
moose
path
and
a
moose
can
go
anywhere
that
a
bird
can
a
carry
is
meant
to
be
the
shortest
distance
between
two
given
places
and
it
does
strive
for
luxury
it
will
go
under
and
over
logs
through
scratchy
thickets
and
gardens
of
poison
ivy
it
will
plow
through
swamps
and
quicksands
it
will
descend
into
pits
it
will
skin
along
the
sharp
edge
of
slippery
rocks
set
up
at
impossible
angles
so
that
only
a
mountain
goat
can
follow
it
without
risking
his
neck
i
believe
it
would
climb
a
tree
if
a
big
one
stood
directly
in
its
path
we
did
not
get
through
with
entire
safety
the
guides
shod
in
their
shoepacks
trained
to
the
business
went
along
safely
enough
though
they
lurched
a
good
deal
under
their
heavy
cargoes
and
seemed
always
on
the
verge
of
disaster
eddie
and
i
did
not
escape
i
saw
eddie
slip
and
i
heard
him
come
down
with
a
grunt
which
i
suspected
meant
damage
it
proved
a
serious
mishap
for
it
was
to
one
of
his
reels
a
bad
business
so
early
in
the
game
i
fell
too
but
i
only
lost
some
small
areas
of
skin
which
i
knew
eddie
would
replace
with
joy
from
a
bottle
in
his
apothecary
bag
but
there
were
things
to
be
seen
on
that
carry
a
partridge
flew
up
and
whirred
away
into
the
bushes
a
hermit
thrush
was
calling
from
the
greenery
and
by
slipping
through
very
carefully
we
managed
to
get
a
sight
of
his
dark
brown
body
then
suddenly
eddie
called
to
me
to
look
and
i
found
him
pointing
up
into
a
tree
porky
porky
he
was
saying
by
which
i
guessed
he
had
found
a
porcupine
for
i
had
been
apprised
of
the
numbers
in
these
woods
come
here
a
shot
for
you
he
added
as
i
drew
nearer
porcupines
damage
a
lot
of
trees
and
should
be
killed
i
gazed
up
and
distinguished
a
black
bunch
clinging
to
the
body
of
a
fairly
large
spruce
near
the
top
he
does
seem
to
be
damaging
that
tree
much
i
said
no
but
he
will
they
kill
ever
so
many
the
state
of
maine
pays
a
bounty
for
their
scalps
i
looked
up
again
porky
seemed
to
be
inoffensive
enough
and
my
killing
blood
was
not
much
aroused
but
the
hunters
and
logmen
destroy
a
good
many
more
trees
with
their
fires
i
argued
why
does
the
state
of
maine
and
the
province
of
nova
scotia
pay
a
bounty
for
the
scalps
of
a
few
hunters
and
logmen
but
eddie
was
insistent
it
was
in
the
line
of
duty
he
urged
to
destroy
porcupines
they
were
of
no
value
except
perhaps
to
eat
will
you
agree
to
eat
this
one
if
i
shoot
him
i
asked
unbundling
my
rifle
somewhat
reluctantly
of
course
that
understood
i
think
even
then
i
would
have
spared
porky
life
but
at
that
moment
he
ran
a
little
way
up
the
tree
there
was
something
about
that
slight
movement
that
stirred
the
old
savage
in
me
i
threw
my
rifle
to
my
shoulder
and
with
hasty
aim
fired
into
the
center
of
the
black
bunch
i
saw
it
make
a
quick
quivering
jump
slip
a
little
and
cling
fast
there
was
no
stopping
now
a
steady
aim
at
the
black
ball
this
time
and
a
second
shot
followed
by
another
convulsive
start
a
long
slide
then
a
heavy
thudding
fall
at
our
feet
a
writhing
and
a
twisting
a
moaning
and
grieving
as
of
a
stricken
child
and
it
was
not
so
easy
to
stop
this
i
sent
shot
after
shot
into
the
quivering
black
ball
before
it
was
finally
still
its
stained
beautifully
pointed
quills
scattered
all
about
when
it
was
over
i
said
well
eddie
they
may
eat
up
the
whole
of
nova
scotia
if
they
want
to
woods
islands
and
all
but
i
never
shoot
another
unless
starving
we
had
none
of
us
starved
enough
to
eat
that
porcupine
in
the
first
place
he
had
to
be
skinned
and
there
seemed
no
good
place
to
begin
the
guides
when
they
came
up
informed
us
that
it
was
easy
enough
to
do
when
you
knew
how
and
that
the
indians
knew
how
and
considered
porcupine
a
great
delicacy
but
we
were
not
indians
at
least
not
in
the
ethnological
sense
and
the
delicacy
in
this
instance
applied
only
to
our
appetites
i
could
see
that
eddie
was
anxious
to
break
his
vow
now
that
his
victim
was
really
dead
by
my
hand
we
gathered
up
a
few
of
the
quills
gingerly
for
a
porcupine
quill
once
in
the
flesh
is
said
to
work
its
way
to
the
heart
and
passed
on
leaving
the
black
pin
cushion
lying
where
it
fell
perhaps
porky
death
saved
one
or
two
more
trees
for
the
next
nova
scotia
fire
there
were
no
trout
for
luncheon
at
our
halt
the
brook
there
was
a
mere
rivulet
and
we
had
not
kept
the
single
small
fish
caught
that
morning
still
i
did
not
mind
not
that
i
was
tired
of
trout
so
soon
but
i
began
to
suspect
that
it
would
require
nerve
and
resolution
to
tackle
them
three
times
a
day
for
a
period
of
weeks
and
that
it
might
be
just
as
well
to
start
rather
gradually
working
in
other
things
from
time
to
time
i
protested
however
when
del
produced
a
can
of
columbia
river
salmon
that
i
said
was
a
gross
insult
to
every
fish
in
the
nova
scotia
waters
canned
salmon
on
a
fishing
trip
the
very
thought
of
it
was
an
offense
i
demanded
that
it
be
left
behind
with
the
porcupine
never
i
declared
would
i
bemean
myself
by
eating
that
cheap
article
of
commerce
that
universally
indigenous
fish
food
here
in
the
home
of
the
chief
the
prince
the
plus
of
all
fishes
the
nova
scotia
trout
so
del
put
the
can
away
smiling
a
little
and
produced
beans
that
was
different
one
may
eat
beans
anywhere

chapter
nine
it
was
well
into
the
afternoon
before
the
canoes
reached
the
end
of
the
carry
poking
out
through
the
green
one
on
the
shoulders
of
each
guide
inverted
like
long
shields
such
as
an
ancient
race
might
have
used
as
a
protection
from
arrows
eddie
and
i
meantime
had
been
employed
getting
a
mess
of
frogs
for
it
was
swampy
just
there
and
frogs
mosquitoes
and
midges
possessed
the
locality
we
anointed
for
the
mosquitoes
and
as
the
midges
are
called
by
the
indians
and
used
our
little
rifles
on
the
frogs
i
wonder
by
the
way
what
mosquitoes
were
made
for
other
people
have
wondered
that
before
but
you
ca
overdo
the
thing
maybe
if
we
keep
on
wondering
we
shall
find
out
knowledge
begins
that
way
and
it
will
take
a
lot
of
speculation
to
solve
the
mosquito
mystery
i
ca
think
of
anything
that
i
could
do
without
easier
than
the
mosquito
he
seems
to
me
a
creature
wholly
devoid
of
virtues
he
is
a
glutton
a
poisoner
a
spreader
of
disease
a
dispenser
of
disturbing
music
that
last
is
the
hardest
to
forgive
if
he
would
only
be
still
i
could
overlook
the
other
things
i
wonder
if
he
will
take
his
voice
with
him
into
the
next
world
i
should
like
to
know
too
which
place
he
is
bound
for
i
should
like
to
know
so
i
could
take
the
other
road
across
mountain
lake
was
not
far
and
then
followed
another
short
carry
another
link
of
removal
to
a
larger
lake
pescawess
it
was
nearly
five
miles
across
pescawess
but
we
made
good
time
for
there
was
a
fair
wind
also
we
had
the
knowledge
that
pescawah
brook
flows
in
on
the
other
side
and
the
trout
there
were
said
to
be
large
and
not
often
disturbed
we
camped
a
little
below
this
brook
and
while
the
tents
were
going
up
eddie
and
i
took
one
of
the
canoes
and
slipped
away
past
an
island
or
two
among
the
strewn
bowlders
at
the
stream
mouth
pausing
to
cast
a
little
here
and
there
though
at
first
with
no
other
result
than
to
get
our
lines
in
a
mess
together
now
say
old
man
eddie
began
as
my
line
made
a
turn
around
his
neck
and
a
twists
around
his
tackle
the
whole
dropping
in
a
heap
in
the
water
you
must
cast
like
that
you
should
use
the
treetop
cast
straight
up
in
the
air
when
there
a
man
behind
you
do
you
know
you
might
lacerate
a
fellow
ear
or
put
a
hook
through
his
lip
or
his
nose
or
something
i
said
that
i
was
sorry
and
that
if
he
would
give
me
a
few
points
on
the
treetop
cast
and
then
avoid
sitting
in
the
treetops
as
much
as
possible
himself
i
thought
there
would
be
no
further
danger
he
was
not
altogether
pacified
the
lines
were
in
a
bad
tangle
and
he
said
it
was
wasting
precious
time
to
be
fooling
that
way
clearly
two
men
could
not
fish
from
one
canoe
and
preserve
their
friendship
and
after
our
lines
were
duly
parted
and
eddie
had
scolded
me
sufficiently
we
went
ashore
just
below
where
the
swift
current
tumbles
in
and
made
our
way
to
the
wide
deep
pools
above
the
going
was
pretty
thick
and
scratchy
and
one
had
to
move
deliberately
eddie
had
more
things
to
carry
than
i
did
for
he
had
brought
his
gun
and
his
net
and
these
with
his
rod
set
up
and
properly
geared
with
a
long
leader
and
two
flies
worried
him
a
good
deal
the
net
had
a
way
of
getting
hung
on
twigs
the
line
and
leader
displayed
a
genius
for
twisting
around
small
but
tough
branches
and
vines
the
hooks
caught
in
unexpected
places
and
the
gun
was
possessed
to
get
between
his
legs
when
i
had
time
to
consider
him
he
was
swearing
steadily
and
i
think
still
blaming
me
for
most
of
his
troubles
though
the
saints
know
i
was
innocent
enough
and
not
without
difficulties
of
my
own
chiefly
i
was
trying
to
avoid
poison
ivy
which
is
my
bane
and
seemed
plentiful
in
this
particular
neck
of
the
woods
we
were
out
at
last
and
the
wide
dark
pool
enclosed
by
great
black
bowlders
and
sloping
slabs
of
stone
seemed
as
if
it
might
repay
our
efforts
not
for
years
maybe
had
an
artificial
fly
been
cast
in
that
water
perhaps
eddie
was
still
annoyed
with
me
for
he
pushed
farther
up
to
other
pools
and
was
presently
lost
to
view
i
was
not
sorry
of
this
for
it
may
be
remembered
that
i
had
thus
far
never
caught
a
trout
by
casting
in
open
smooth
water
and
i
was
willing
to
practice
a
little
alone
i
decided
to
work
deliberately
without
haste
and
excitement
and
to
get
my
flies
caught
in
the
treetops
as
infrequently
as
possible
i
adjusted
them
now
took
a
good
look
behind
and
tossed
my
cast
toward
the
other
side
of
the
dark
pool
i
thought
i
did
it
rather
well
too
and
i
dragged
the
flies
with
a
twitching
motion
as
i
had
seen
eddie
do
it
but
nothing
happened
if
there
were
trout
anywhere
in
the
world
they
would
be
in
a
pool
like
this
and
if
there
was
ever
an
evening
for
them
it
was
now
it
was
in
the
nature
of
probability
that
eddie
would
come
back
with
a
good
string
and
i
could
not
let
him
find
me
a
confessed
failure
so
once
more
i
sent
the
flies
out
over
the
pool
a
little
farther
this
time
and
twitched
them
a
little
more
carefully
but
i
might
have
been
fishing
in
a
tub
so
far
as
any
tangible
fish
were
concerned
a
little
more
line
and
a
reckless
back
cast
landed
my
tail
fly
in
a
limb
a
combination
which
required
time
and
patience
to
disengage
by
the
time
i
had
worked
out
the
puzzle
it
began
to
seem
like
a
warm
evening
then
i
snapped
the
flies
into
several
different
corners
of
the
pool
got
hung
again
on
the
same
limb
jerked
and
broke
the
fly
and
repeated
some
of
the
words
i
had
learned
from
eddie
as
we
came
through
the
brush
i
was
cooler
after
that
and
decided
to
put
on
a
new
and
different
fly
i
thought
a
jenny
lind
would
be
about
the
thing
and
pretty
soon
was
slapping
it
about
at
first
hopefully
then
rashly
then
in
mere
desperation
i
changed
the
top
fly
and
put
on
a
montreal
of
course
i
would
catch
anything
i
never
would
catch
anything
except
by
trolling
as
any
other
duffer
or
even
a
baby
might
but
i
would
have
fun
with
the
flies
anyway
so
the
montreal
went
capering
out
over
the
pool
landing
somewhere
amid
the
rocks
on
the
other
side
and
then
all
at
once
i
had
my
hands
full
of
business
for
there
was
a
leap
and
a
splash
and
a
of
the
reel
and
a
second
later
my
rod
was
curved
like
a
buggy
whip
the
line
as
taut
as
wire
and
weaving
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
with
a
live
heavy
body
the
body
of
a
trout
a
real
trout
hooked
by
me
with
a
fly
cast
on
a
quiet
pool
i
would
have
lost
that
fish
for
money
but
i
was
deadly
afraid
of
doing
so
a
good
thing
for
me
then
my
practice
in
landing
of
the
evening
before
easy
now
easy
i
said
to
myself
just
as
del
had
done
if
you
lose
this
fish
you
a
duffer
sure
enough
also
a
chump
and
several
other
undesirable
things
do
hurry
him
do
give
him
unnecessary
line
in
this
close
place
where
there
may
be
snags
do
above
all
things
let
him
get
any
slack
on
you
just
a
little
line
now
a
few
inches
will
do
and
keep
the
tip
of
your
rod
up
if
you
point
it
at
him
and
he
gets
a
straight
pull
he
will
jump
off
sure
or
he
will
rush
and
you
can
not
gather
the
slack
work
him
toward
you
now
toward
your
feet
close
in
your
net
has
a
short
handle
and
is
suspended
around
your
neck
by
a
rubber
cord
the
cord
will
stretch
of
course
but
you
can
never
reach
him
over
there
do
mind
the
reel
you
have
taken
up
enough
line
you
ca
lift
out
a
fish
like
that
on
a
rod
on
any
rod
short
of
a
hickory
sapling
work
him
toward
you
you
gump
bring
your
rod
up
straighter
straighter
straight
now
for
the
net
carefully
oh
you
clumsy
duffer
to
miss
him
do
you
know
that
you
ca
thrash
him
into
the
net
like
that
that
you
must
dip
the
net
him
i
suppose
you
thought
you
were
catching
mice
you
deserve
to
lose
him
altogether
once
more
now
he
right
at
your
feet
a
king
two
long
backward
steps
after
that
dip
for
i
must
be
certain
that
he
was
away
from
the
water
edge
then
i
bumped
into
something
something
soft
that
laughed
it
was
eddie
and
he
had
two
fish
in
his
landing
net
bully
he
said
you
did
it
only
you
do
need
to
try
to
beat
him
to
death
with
the
landing
net
better
than
mine
he
added
as
i
took
my
trout
off
the
fly
suppose
now
we
go
below
i
taken
a
look
and
there
a
great
pool
right
where
the
brook
comes
out
we
can
get
to
it
in
the
canoe
i
handle
the
canoe
while
you
fish
that
also
is
eddie
way
he
had
scolded
me
and
he
would
make
amends
he
had
already
taken
down
his
rod
and
we
made
our
way
back
through
the
brush
without
much
difficulty
though
i
was
still
hot
with
effort
and
excitement
and
i
fear
a
little
careless
about
the
poison
ivy
a
few
minutes
later
eddie
who
handles
a
canoe
as
he
does
everything
else
pertaining
to
the
woods
with
grace
and
skill
had
worked
our
craft
among
the
rocks
into
the
wide
swift
water
that
came
out
from
under
a
huge
fallen
log
the
mouth
of
pescawah
brook
cast
there
he
said
pointing
to
a
spot
just
below
the
log
within
twenty
minutes
from
that
time
i
had
learned
more
about
fishing
real
trout
fishing
than
i
had
known
before
in
all
my
life
i
had
in
eddie
a
peerless
instructor
and
i
had
such
water
for
a
drill
ground
as
is
not
found
in
every
day
or
every
week
or
every
travel
besides
there
were
fish
singly
and
in
pairs
they
came
great
beautiful
mottled
fellows
sometimes
leaping
clear
of
the
water
like
a
porpoise
to
catch
the
fly
before
it
fell
there
were
none
less
than
a
pound
and
many
over
that
weight
when
we
had
enough
for
supper
and
breakfast
a
dozen
maybe
we
put
back
the
others
that
came
as
soon
as
taken
from
the
hook
the
fishing
soon
ended
then
for
i
believe
the
trout
have
some
means
of
communication
and
one
or
two
trout
returned
to
a
pool
will
temporarily
discourage
the
others
it
did
not
matter
i
had
had
enough
and
once
more
thanks
to
eddie
returned
to
the
camp
jubilant
footnotes
when
this
chapter
appeared

frederic

wrote
as

my
dear
paine
just
read
your

your

they
were

civilization
otherwise
no

not

i
am
naturally
glad
to
have
this
word
of
wisdom
from
an
authority
like
remington
but
i
still
think
that
providence
could
have
achieved

somehow
managed

your

chapter
ten
it
was
raining
next
morning
but
that
was
not
the
worst
during
the
night
i
had
awakened
with
a
curious
but
not
entirely
unfamiliar
sensation
about
one
of
my
eyes
there
was
a
slight
irritant
itching
tendency
and
the
flesh
felt
puffy
to
the
touch
i
tried
to
believe
it
was
imagination
and
went
to
sleep
again
but
there
was
no
doubt
next
morning
imagination
is
a
taunting
jade
but
i
do
believe
she
could
close
one
of
my
eyes
and
fatten
up
the
other
not
in
so
short
a
time
it
was
poison
ivy
that
was
what
it
was
and
i
had
it
bad
illustration
our
one
was
not
big
enough
to
hold
all
of
even
one
eye
when
eddie
woke
which
he
did
finally
he
took
one
look
at
me
and
dove
back
into
his
sleeping
bag
out
of
pure
fear
he
said
i
was
a
sight
and
he
was
correct
our
one
was
not
big
enough
to
hold
all
of
even
one
eye
but
taking
my
features
in
sections
i
could
see
that
he
had
not
overstated
my
appearance
perhaps
the
situation
was
amusing
too
at
least
eddie
and
even
the
guides
professed
to
be
entertained
but
for
me
huddled
against
one
side
of
a
six
by
eight
tent
a
tent
otherwise
packed
with
bags
and
bundles
and
traps
of
various
kinds
eddie
things
mostly
and
eddie
himself
among
them
with
a
chill
rain
coming
down
outside
and
with
a
face
swollen
and
aching
in
a
desperate
way
with
poison
the
quality
of
the
humor
to
me
seemed
strained
when
i
tried
to
distinguish
it
with
the
part
of
an
eye
i
had
left
eddie
meantime
had
dived
down
into
his
bag
of
remedies
happy
to
have
a
chance
to
use
any
or
all
of
them
and
was
laying
them
out
on
his
sleeping
bag
in
front
of
him
in
his
lap
as
it
were
for
he
had
not
yet
arisen
reading
the
labels
and
wondering
which
he
should
try
on
me
first
i
waited
a
little
then
i
said
never
mind
those
eddie
give
me
your
alcohol
and
witch
hazel
but
then
came
an
embarrassing
moment
running
his
eye
over
the
bottles
and
cans
eddie
was
obliged
to
confess
that
not
one
of
them
contained
either
alcohol
or
witch
hazel
eddie
i
said
reproachfully
can
it
be
in
a
drug
store
like
that
there
is
neither
alcohol
nor
witch
hazel
he
nodded
dismally
i
meant
to
bring
them
he
said
but
the
triple
extract
of
gelsemium
would
do
such
a
lot
of
things
and
i
thought
i
did
need
them
and
then
you
made
fun
of
that
and
and
never
mind
eddie
i
said
i
have
an
inspiration
if
alcohol
cures
it
maybe
whisky
will
and
thank
heaven
we
did
bring
the
whisky
we
remained
two
days
in
that
camp
and
i
followed
up
the
whisky
treatment
faithfully
it
rained
most
of
the
time
so
the
delay
did
not
matter
indeed
it
was
great
luck
that
we
were
not
held
longer
by
that
distressing
disorder
which
comes
of
the
malignant
plant
known
as
mercury
or
poison
ivy
often
it
has
disqualified
me
for
a
week
or
more
but
the
whisky
treatment
was
a
success
many
times
a
day
i
bathed
my
face
in
the
pure
waters
of
the
lake
and
then
with
the
spirits
rye
or
scotch
as
happened
to
be
handy
by
the
afternoon
of
the
first
day
i
could
see
to
put
sirup
on
my
flapjacks
and
once
between
showers
i
felt
able
to
go
out
with
eddie
in
the
canoe
during
which
excursion
he
took
a
wonderful
string
of
trout
in
a
scummy
pool
where
no
one
would
ever
expect
trout
to
lie
and
where
no
one
but
eddie
could
have
taken
them
at
all
by
the
next
morning
after
a
night
of
sorrow
for
my
face
always
pained
and
itched
worse
when
everybody
was
in
bed
and
still
with
nothing
to
soothe
me
but
the
eternal
drip
drip
from
the
boughs
and
from
the
eaves
of
the
tent
the
swelling
was
still
further
reduced
and
i
felt
able
to
travel
and
i
wish
to
add
here
in
all
seriousness
that
whatever
may
be
your
scruples
against
the
use
of
liquors
do
go
into
the
woods
without
whisky
rye
or
scotch
according
to
preference
alcohol
of
course
is
good
for
poison
ivy
but
whisky
is
better
maybe
it
is
because
of
the
drugs
that
wicked
men
are
said
to
put
into
it
besides
whisky
has
other
uses
the
guides
told
us
of
one
perfectly
rigid
person
who
when
he
had
discovered
that
whisky
was
being
included
in
his
camp
supplies
had
become
properly
incensed
and
commanded
that
it
be
left
at
home
the
guides
had
pleaded
that
he
need
not
drink
any
of
it
that
they
would
attend
to
that
part
of
what
seemed
to
them
a
necessary
camp
duty
but
he
was
petrified
in
his
morals
and
the
whisky
remained
behind
well
they
struck
a
chilly
snap
and
it
rained
it
was
none
of
your
little
summer
landscape
rains
either
it
was
a
deadly
cold
driving
drenching
saturation
men
who
had
built
their
houses
on
the
sand
and
had
no
whisky
were
in
a
bad
fix
the
waves
rose
and
the
tents
blew
down
and
the
rigid
fossilized
person
had
to
be
carried
across
an
overflowed
place
on
the
back
of
a
guide
lifting
up
his
voice
meanwhile
in
an
effort
to
convince
the
almighty
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
let
it
rain
at
this
particular
time
and
calling
for
whisky
at
every
step
it
is
well
to
carry
one
morals
into
the
woods
but
if
i
had
to
leave
either
behind
i
should
take
the
whisky
it
was
a
short
carry
to
lake
pescawah
beyond
that
water
we
carried
again
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
a
lake
called
pebbleloggitch
perhaps
for
the
reason
that
the
indian
who
picked
out
the
name
could
find
a
harder
one
from
pebbleloggitch
we
made
our
way
by
a
long
stillwater
through
a
land
wherein
no
man
not
even
an
indian
perhaps
has
ever
made
his
home
for
it
lies
through
a
weird
lonely
marsh
a
sort
of
meadow
which
no
reaper
ever
harvested
where
none
but
the
wild
moose
ever
feeds
we
were
nearing
the
edge
of
the
unknown
now
one
of
the
guides
del
i
think
had
been
through
this
stillwater
once
before
a
long
time
ago
at
the
end
of
it
he
knew
lay
the
upper
shelburne
river
which
was
said
to
flow
through
a
sheet
of
water
called
irving
lake
but
where
the
river
entered
the
lake
and
where
it
left
it
was
for
us
to
learn
already
forty
miles
or
more
from
our
starting
point
straight
into
the
wilderness
we
were
isolated
from
all
mankind
and
the
undiscovered
lay
directly
before
at
the
end
of
the
stillwater
del
said
well
gentlemen
from
this
on
you
know
as
much
of
the
country
as
i
do
all
i
know
is
what
i
heard
and
that
not
much
i
guess
most
of
it
we
have
to
learn
for
ourselves
chapter
eleven
lonely
tarn
mid
thicket
deep
comes
to
sturdy
young
and
she
doth
safely
guarded
chapter
eleven
we
got
any
amount
of
in
the
pebbleloggitch
stillwater
but
no
trout
i
kept
del
dodging
and
twice
i
succeeded
in
hooking
him
though
not
in
a
vital
spot
i
could
have
done
it
however
if
he
had
sat
still
and
given
me
a
fair
chance
i
could
land
del
even
with
the
treetop
cast
but
the
trout
refused
to
be
allured
as
a
rule
trout
would
not
care
to
live
in
a
place
like
that
there
would
not
be
enough
excitement
and
activity
a
trout
prefers
a
place
where
the
water
is
busy
where
the
very
effort
of
keeping
from
being
smashed
and
battered
against
the
rocks
insures
a
good
circulation
and
a
constitution
like
a
steel
spring
i
have
taken
trout
out
of
water
that
would
have
pulverized
a
golf
ball
in
five
minutes
the
fiercer
the
current
the
greater
the
tumult
the
more
cruel
and
savage
the
rocks
the
better
place
it
is
for
trout
neither
do
i
remember
that
we
took
anything
in
the
shelburne
above
irving
lake
for
it
was
a
good
deal
like
the
stillwater
with
only
a
gentle
riffle
here
and
there
besides
the
day
had
become
chill
and
a
mist
had
fallen
upon
this
lonely
world
a
wet
white
drifting
mist
that
was
closely
akin
to
rain
on
such
a
day
one
does
not
expect
trout
to
rise
and
is
seldom
disappointed
here
and
there
where
the
current
was
and
unruffled
eddie
perhaps
would
have
tried
his
dry
flies
but
never
a
trout
was
seen
to
break
water
and
it
is
one
of
the
tenets
of
fishing
that
a
cast
may
only
be
made
where
a
trout
has
been
seen
to
rise
even
then
only
after
a
good
deal
of
careful
maneuvering
on
shore
to
reach
the
proper
spot
on
the
bank
without
breaking
the
news
to
the
trout
it
was
a
pleasant
time
to
go
wriggling
through
marsh
grass
and
things
along
the
shore
so
it
is
just
as
well
that
there
was
no
excuse
for
doing
it
as
it
was
we
paddled
rather
silently
down
the
still
river
considerably
impressed
with
the
thought
that
we
were
entering
a
land
to
us
unknown
that
for
far
and
far
in
every
direction
beyond
the
white
mist
that
shut
us
in
and
the
world
it
was
likely
that
there
was
no
human
soul
that
was
not
of
our
party
and
we
were
quieted
by
the
silence
and
the
loneliness
on
every
hand
where
the
river
entered
the
lake
there
was
no
dashing
tumbling
water
in
fact
we
did
not
realize
that
we
had
reached
the
lake
level
until
the
shores
on
either
hand
receded
slowly
at
first
and
then
broadly
widening
melted
away
and
were
half
lost
in
the
mist
the
feeling
grew
upon
me
all
at
once
that
we
were
very
high
here
there
were
no
hills
or
ridges
that
we
could
see
and
the
outlines
of
such
timber
as
grew
along
the
shore
seemed
low
it
was
as
if
we
had
reached
the
top
of
the
world
where
there
were
no
more
hills
where
the
trees
had
been
obliged
to
struggle
up
to
our
altitude
barely
to
fringe
us
round
as
for
course
now
we
had
none
our
map
was
of
the
vaguest
sort
where
the
outlet
was
we
could
only
surmise
in
a
general
way
it
was
supposed
to
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
lake
where
there
was
said
to
be
an
old
dam
built
when
the
region
was
lumbered
long
ago
but
as
to
the
shape
of
the
lake
and
just
where
that
other
end
might
lie
when
every
side
except
the
bit
of
shore
nearest
at
hand
was
lost
in
the
wet
chill
mist
were
matters
for
conjecture
and
experiment
we
paddled
a
little
distance
and
some
islands
came
out
of
the
gray
veil
ahead
green
nova
scotia
islands
with
their
ledges
of
rock
some
underbrush
and
a
few
sentinel
pines
we
ran
in
close
to
these
our
guides
looking
for
moose
or
signs
of
them
i
may
say
here
that
no
expedition
in
nova
scotia
is
a
success
without
having
seen
at
least
one
moose
of
course
in
the
hunting
season
the
moose
is
the
prime
object
but
such
is
the
passion
for
this
animal
among
nova
scotia
guides
that
whatever
the
season
or
the
purpose
of
the
expedition
and
however
triumphant
its
result
it
is
accounted
a
disappointment
and
a
failure
by
the
natives
when
it
ends
without
at
least
a
glimpse
of
a
moose
we
were
in
wonderful
moose
country
now
the
uninvaded
wild
where
in
trackless
bog
and
swamp
or
on
the
lonely
and
forgotten
islands
the
secludes
herself
to
bear
and
rear
her
young
that
charlie
and
del
were
more
absorbed
in
the
possibility
of
getting
a
sight
of
these
great
timid
vanishing
visions
of
animal
life
and
perhaps
a
longer
view
of
a
little
black
bleating
calf
than
in
any
exploration
for
the
other
end
of
the
shelburne
river
was
evident
they
clung
and
hovered
about
those
islands
poking
the
canoes
into
every
nook
and
corner
speaking
in
whispers
and
sitting
up
straight
at
sight
of
any
stump
or
bunch
of
leaves
eddie
too
seemed
a
good
deal
interested
in
the
moose
idea
i
discovered
presently
that
he
was
ambitious
to
send
a
specimen
of
a
moose
calf
dead
or
alive
to
the
british
museum
and
would
improve
any
opportunity
to
acquire
that
asset
i
may
say
that
i
was
opposed
to
any
such
purpose
i
am
overfond
of
eddie
and
i
wanted
him
to
have
a
good
standing
with
the
museum
people
but
i
did
not
like
the
idea
of
slaughtering
a
little
calf
moose
before
its
mother
very
eyes
and
i
did
not
approve
of
its
capture
either
even
if
the
mother
moose
could
be
convinced
that
our
intentions
were
good
and
was
willing
to
have
her
offspring
civilized
and
in
the
british
museum
or
zoo
or
some
other
distinguished
place
i
still
opposed
the
general
scheme
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
a
calf
moose
tied
either
outside
or
inside
of
our
tent
for
a
period
of
weeks
to
bleat
and
tear
around
and
to
kick
over
and
muss
up
things
generally
would
be
a
proper
feature
to
add
to
a
camp
especially
if
it
kept
on
raining
and
we
had
to
bring
him
inside
i
knew
that
eventually
he
would
own
that
tent
and
probably
demand
a
sleeping
bag
i
knew
that
i
should
have
to
give
him
mine
or
at
least
share
it
with
him
i
stated
and
emphasized
these
views
and
insisted
that
we
go
over
toward
the
shore
where
there
appeared
to
be
an
opening
which
might
be
the
river
we
did
go
over
there
at
length
and
there
was
in
fact
an
opening
but
it
was
made
by
a
brook
entering
the
lake
instead
of
leaving
it
our
memorandum
of
information
declared
that
a
stream
called
the
susketch
emptied
into
the
lake
somewhere
and
we
decided
to
identify
this
as
the
place
we
went
up
a
little
way
to
a
good
looking
pool
but
there
were
no
trout
at
least
they
refused
to
rise
though
probably
the
oldest
and
mossiest
inhabitant
of
that
place
had
never
had
such
an
opportunity
before
back
to
the
lake
again
we
were
pretty
soon
hovering
about
the
enchanted
islands
which
seemed
to
rise
on
every
hand
it
was
just
the
sort
of
a
day
to
see
moose
del
said
and
there
was
no
other
matter
that
would
stand
in
importance
against
a
proposition
like
that
i
became
interested
myself
presently
and
dropped
my
voice
to
a
whisper
and
sat
up
at
every
black
spot
among
the
leaves
we
had
just
about
given
it
up
at
length
when
all
at
once
del
gave
the
canoe
a
great
shove
inshore
at
the
same
time
calling
softly
to
the
other
canoe
which
had
already
sheared
off
into
the
lake
they
were
with
us
in
an
instant
and
we
were
clambering
out
i
seen
a
thing
but
del
swore
that
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
black
that
moved
and
disappeared
of
course
we
were
clad
in
our
armor
i
had
on
my
oilskins
and
what
was
more
those
high
heavy
wading
boots
that
came
up
under
my
arms
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
get
over
even
level
ground
rapidly
with
a
rig
like
that
and
when
it
comes
to
scaling
an
island
full
of
ledges
and
holes
and
underbrush
and
vines
the
problem
becomes
complex
del
and
charlie
with
their
shoepacks
distanced
me
as
easily
as
if
i
had
been
sitting
still
while
that
grasshopper
eddie
with
only
the
lightest
sort
of
waders
skipped
and
scampered
away
and
left
me
plunging
and
floundering
about
in
the
brush
with
scarcely
the
possibility
of
seeing
anything
even
if
it
were
directly
in
front
of
my
nose
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
care
anything
about
seeing
moose
and
was
only
running
and
making
a
donkey
of
myself
because
the
others
were
doing
it
and
i
had
caught
a
touch
of
their
disease
suddenly
i
heard
charlie
call
there
they
are
there
they
go
and
with
a
wild
redoubled
effort
i
went
headlong
into
a
deep
pit
with
leaves
and
brush
and
muck
of
various
sorts
this
of
course
would
seem
to
assassinate
any
hope
i
might
have
of
seeing
the
moose
but
just
then
by
some
occult
process
charles
the
strong
discovered
my
disaster
and
with
that
prowess
which
has
made
him
famous
yanked
me
out
of
the
mess
stood
me
on
my
feet
and
had
me
running
again
wallowing
through
the
bushes
toward
the
other
side
of
the
little
island
whence
the
moose
had
fled
there
they
go
they
are
swimming
i
heard
del
call
and
then
eddie
i
see
em
i
see
em
and
then
charles
voice
a
little
ahead
of
me
illustration
hurry
hurry
they
got
over
to
the
shore
hurry
hurry
they
got
over
to
the
shore
i
reached
the
shore
myself
just
then
our
shore
i
mean
on
all
fours
and
full
of
scratches
and
bruises
but
not
too
late
for
beyond
a
wide
neck
of
water
on
the
mainland
two
dark
phantoms
drifted
a
little
way
through
the
mist
and
vanished
into
the
dark
foliage
behind
it
was
only
a
glimpse
i
had
and
i
was
battered
up
and
still
disordered
more
or
less
with
the
ivy
poison
but
somehow
i
was
satisfied
for
one
thing
i
had
become
infected
with
a
tinge
of
the
native
enthusiasm
about
seeing
the
great
game
of
the
woods
and
then
down
in
my
soul
i
rejoiced
that
eddie
had
failed
to
capture
the
little
calf
furthermore
it
was
comforting
to
reflect
that
even
from
the
guides
point
of
view
our
expedition
whatever
else
might
come
must
be
considered
a
success
we
now
got
down
to
business
it
was
well
along
toward
evening
and
though
these
days
were
long
days
this
one
with
its
somber
skies
and
heavy
mist
would
close
in
early
we
felt
that
it
was
desirable
to
find
the
lake
outlet
before
pitching
our
tents
for
the
islands
make
rather
poor
camping
places
and
lake
fishing
is
apt
to
be
slow
work
we
wanted
to
get
settled
in
camp
on
the
lower
shelburne
before
night
and
be
ready
for
the
next
day
sport
we
therefore
separated
agreeing
upon
a
signal
of
two
shots
from
whichever
of
us
had
the
skill
or
fortune
to
discover
the
outlet
the
other
canoe
faded
into
the
mist
below
the
islands
while
we
paddled
slowly
toward
the
gray
green
shores
opposite
when
presently
we
were
all
alone
i
was
filled
somehow
with
the
feeling
that
must
have
come
over
those
old
canadian
voyageurs
who
were
first
to
make
their
way
through
the
northlands
threading
the
network
of
unknown
waters
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
we
were
pioneers
in
this
desolate
spot
and
so
far
as
sportsmen
were
concerned
it
may
be
that
we
were
chapter
twelve
lake
is
dull
with
the
drifting
mist
the
shores
are
dim
and
blind
where
is
the
way
ahead
what
of
the
path
behind
chapter
twelve
along
the
wet
blurred
shore
we
cruised
the
mist
getting
thicker
and
more
like
rain
here
and
there
we
entered
some
little
bay
or
nook
that
from
a
distance
looked
as
if
it
might
be
an
outlet
eventually
we
lost
all
direction
and
simply
investigated
at
random
wherever
any
appearance
seemed
inviting
once
we
went
up
a
long
slough
and
were
almost
ready
to
fire
the
signal
shots
when
we
discovered
our
mistake
it
seemed
a
narrow
escape
from
the
humiliation
of
giving
a
false
alarm
what
had
become
of
the
others
we
did
not
know
evidently
the
lake
was
a
big
one
and
they
might
be
miles
away
eddie
had
the
only
compass
though
this
would
seem
to
be
of
no
special
advantage
at
last
just
before
us
the
shore
parted
a
definite
wide
parting
it
was
that
when
we
pushed
into
it
did
not
close
and
come
to
nothing
but
kept
on
and
on
opening
out
ahead
we
went
a
good
way
in
to
make
sure
the
water
seemed
very
still
but
then
we
remembered
the
flatness
of
the
country
undoubtedly
this
was
the
outlet
and
we
had
discovered
it
it
was
only
natural
that
we
should
feel
a
certain
elation
in
our
having
had
the
good
fortune
the
instinct
as
it
were
to
proceed
aright
i
lifted
my
gun
and
it
was
with
a
sort
of
triumphant
flourish
that
i
fired
the
two
signal
shots
it
may
be
that
the
reader
will
not
fully
understand
the
importance
of
finding
a
little
thing
like
the
outlet
of
a
lake
on
a
wet
disagreeable
day
when
the
other
fellows
are
looking
for
it
too
and
here
far
away
from
that
northern
desolation
it
does
not
seem
even
to
me
a
very
great
affair
whether
our
canoe
or
eddie
made
the
discovery
but
for
some
reason
it
counted
a
lot
then
and
i
suppose
del
and
i
were
unduly
elated
over
our
success
it
was
just
as
well
that
we
were
for
our
period
of
joy
was
brief
in
the
very
instant
while
my
finger
was
still
touching
the
trigger
we
heard
come
soggily
through
the
mist
from
far
down
the
chill
gray
water
one
shot
and
then
another
i
looked
at
del
and
he
at
me
they
found
something
too
i
said
do
you
suppose
there
are
two
outlets
anyhow
here
goes
and
i
fired
again
our
two
shots
of
discovery
and
a
little
later
two
more
so
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
in
our
manifest
i
was
not
content
you
see
with
the
possibility
of
being
considered
just
an
ordinary
ass
i
must
establish
proof
beyond
question
of
a
supreme
idiocy
in
the
matter
of
woodcraft
that
is
my
way
in
many
things
i
know
for
i
have
done
it
often
i
shall
keep
on
doing
it
i
suppose
until
the
moment
when
i
am
permitted
to
say
i
die
innocent
they
only
think
they
have
found
something
i
said
to
del
now
probably
the
long
slough
we
found
a
while
ago
they
be
up
here
quick
enough
and
i
fired
yet
two
more
shots
to
rub
it
in
but
now
two
more
shots
came
also
from
eddie
and
again
two
more
by
this
time
we
had
pushed
several
hundred
yards
farther
into
the
opening
and
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
it
was
a
genuine
river
i
was
growing
every
moment
more
elated
with
our
triumph
over
the
others
and
in
thinking
how
we
would
ride
them
down
when
they
finally
had
to
abandon
their
lead
and
follow
ours
when
all
at
once
del
who
had
been
looking
over
the
side
of
the
canoe
grew
grave
and
stopped
paddling
there
seems
to
be
a
little
current
here
he
pointing
down
to
the
grass
which
showed
plainly
now
in
the
clear
water
yes
there
is
a
current
he
went
on
very
slowly
his
voice
becoming
more
dismal
at
every
word
but
it
going
the
wrong
way
i
looked
down
intently
sure
enough
the
grass
on
the
bottom
pointed
back
toward
the
lake
then
it
is
the
shelburne
after
all
i
said
but
another
river
we
discovered
del
looked
at
me
pathetically
it
the
shelburne
all
right
he
nodded
and
there
was
deep
suffering
in
his
tones
oh
yes
it
the
shelburne
only
it
happens
to
be
the
upper
end
the
place
where
we
came
in
that
rock
is
where
you
stopped
to
make
a
few
casts
no
canoe
ever
got
out
of
the
upper
shelburne
river
quicker
than
ours
those
first
old
voyageurs
of
that
waste
region
never
made
better
time
down
irving
lake
only
now
and
then
i
fired
some
more
to
announce
our
coming
and
to
prepare
for
the
lie
we
meant
to
establish
that
we
only
had
been
replying
to
their
shots
all
along
and
not
announcing
anything
new
and
important
of
our
own
but
it
was
no
use
we
had
guilt
written
on
our
features
and
we
never
had
been
taught
to
lie
convincingly
in
fact
it
was
wasted
effort
from
the
start
the
other
canoe
had
been
near
enough
when
we
entered
the
trap
to
see
us
go
in
and
even
then
had
located
the
true
opening
which
was
no
great
distance
away
they
jeered
us
to
silence
and
they
rode
us
down
they
carefully
drew
our
attention
to
the
old
log
dam
in
proof
that
this
was
the
real
outlet
they
pointed
to
the
rapid
outpouring
current
for
it
was
a
swift
boiling
stream
here
and
asked
us
if
we
could
tell
which
way
it
was
flowing
for
a
time
our
disgrace
was
both
active
and
complete
then
came
a
diversion
real
rain
the
usual
night
downpour
set
in
and
there
was
a
scramble
to
get
the
tents
up
and
our
goods
under
cover
yet
the
abuse
had
told
on
me
one
of
my
eyes
the
last
to
yield
to
the
whisky
treatment
began
to
throb
a
good
deal
and
i
dragged
off
my
wet
clothes
got
on
a
dry
garment
the
only
thing
i
had
left
by
this
time
that
was
dry
and
worked
my
way
laboriously
section
by
section
into
my
sleeping
bag
after
which
eddie
was
sorry
for
me
as
i
knew
he
would
be
and
brought
me
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
toast
and
put
a
nice
piece
of
chocolate
into
my
mouth
and
sang
me
a
song
it
had
been
a
pretty
strenuous
day
and
i
had
been
bruised
and
cold
and
wet
and
scratched
and
humiliated
but
the
tea
and
toast
put
me
in
a
forgiving
spirit
and
the
chocolate
was
good
and
eddie
can
sing
i
was
dry
too
and
reasonably
warm
and
the
rain
hissing
into
the
campfire
at
the
door
had
a
soothing
sound
chapter
thirteen
take
the
advice
that
i
do
not
need
i
do
not
heed
alway
there
many
a
fool
can
make
a
only
the
wise
chapter
thirteen
as
usual
the
clouds
had
emptied
themselves
by
morning
the
sky
was
still
dull
and
threatening
and
from
the
tent
door
the
water
of
the
lake
was
gray
but
the
mist
had
gone
and
the
islands
came
out
green
and
beautiful
the
conditions
made
it
possible
to
get
some
clothing
decently
smoked
and
scorched
which
is
the
nearest
approach
to
dryness
one
is
ever
likely
to
achieve
in
the
woods
in
a
rainy
season
i
may
say
here
that
the
time
will
come
and
all
too
soon
in
a
period
of
rain
when
you
will
reach
your
last
dry
suit
of
underwear
and
get
it
wet
then
have
a
care
be
content
to
stay
in
a
safe
dry
spot
if
you
can
find
one
you
will
have
to
go
to
bed
of
course
to
do
it
until
something
is
dry
that
is
pretty
dry
to
change
from
one
wet
suit
to
another
only
a
little
less
so
is
conducive
neither
to
comfort
nor
to
a
peaceful
old
age
above
all
do
not
put
on
your
night
garment
or
garments
for
underwear
for
they
will
get
wet
too
then
your
condition
will
be
desperate
i
submit
the
above
as
good
advice
i
know
it
is
good
advice
for
i
did
not
follow
it
i
have
never
followed
good
advice
i
have
only
given
it
at
the
end
of
several
nights
of
rain
and
moist
days
i
had
nothing
really
dry
but
my
nightshirt
and
one
slipper
and
i
think
condition
was
not
so
far
removed
what
we
did
was
to
pick
out
the
least
damp
of
our
things
and
smoke
and
scorch
them
on
a
pole
over
the
campfire
until
they
had
a
sort
of
a
look
like
bread
toasted
over
a
gas
jet
then
suddenly
we
would
seize
them
and
put
them
on
hot
and
go
around
steaming
and
smelling
of
leaf
smoke
and
burnt
dry
goods
these
odors
blended
with
the
fragrance
of
camphor
tar
and
pennyroyal
with
which
we
were
presently
saturated
in
every
pore
for
though
it
was
said
to
be
too
late
for
black
flies
and
too
early
for
mosquitoes
the
rear
guard
of
the
one
and
the
advance
guard
of
the
other
combined
to
furnish
us
with
a
good
deal
of
special
occupation
the
most
devoted
follower
of
the
prophet
never
anointed
himself
oftener
than
we
did
and
of
course
this
continuous
oily
application
made
it
impossible
to
wash
very
perfectly
besides
it
seemed
a
waste
to
wash
off
the
precious
protection
when
to
do
so
meant
only
another
immediate
and
more
thorough
treatment
i
will
dwell
for
a
moment
on
this
matter
of
washing
fishing
and
camping
though
fairly
clean
recreations
will
be
found
not
altogether
free
from
soiling
and
grimy
tendencies
and
when
one
does
not
or
can
not
thoroughly
remove
the
evidences
several
times
a
day
they
begin
to
tell
on
his
general
appearance
gradually
our
hands
lost
everything
original
except
their
shape
then
i
found
that
to
shave
took
off
a
good
deal
of
valuable
ointment
each
time
and
i
approved
of
eddie
ideas
in
this
direction
to
the
extent
of
following
his
example
i
believe
though
that
i
washed
myself
longer
than
he
did
that
is
at
stated
intervals
of
course
we
never
gave
up
the
habit
altogether
it
would
break
out
sporadically
and
at
unexpected
moments
but
i
do
not
recall
that
these
lapses
ever
became
dangerous
or
offensive
my
recollection
is
that
eddie
gave
up
washing
as
a
mania
that
morning
at
the
foot
of
irving
lake
and
that
i
held
out
until
the
next
sunrise
or
it
may
have
been
only
until
that
evening
it
does
not
matter
washing
is
a
good
deal
a
question
of
pride
anyway
and
pride
did
not
count
any
more
even
had
lost
its
charm
illustration
if
one
things
are
well
smoked
and
scorched
and
scalded
and
put
on
hot
in
the
morning
illustration
we
never
failed
to
hide
the
whisky
in
the
matter
of
clothing
however
i
wish
to
record
that
i
never
did
put
on
my
nightdress
for
an
undergarment
i
was
tempted
to
do
so
daily
but
down
within
me
a
still
small
voice
urged
the
rashness
of
such
a
deed
and
each
night
i
was
thankful
for
that
caution
if
one
things
are
well
smoked
and
scorched
and
scalded
and
put
on
hot
in
the
morning
he
can
forget
presently
that
they
are
not
also
dry
and
there
is
a
chance
that
they
may
become
so
before
night
but
to
face
the
prospect
of
getting
into
a
wet
garment
to
sleep
that
would
have
a
tendency
to
destroy
the
rare
charm
and
flavor
of
camp
life
in
time
i
clung
to
my
dry
nightshirt
as
to
a
i
wrapped
it
up
mornings
as
a
jewel
buried
it
deep
in
the
bottom
of
my
bag
and
i
locked
the
bag
not
that
eddie
did
not
have
one
of
his
own
it
may
be
that
he
had
a
variety
of
such
things
and
as
for
the
guides
i
have
a
notion
that
they
prefer
wet
clothes
but
though
this
was
a
wild
country
where
it
was
unlikely
that
we
should
meet
any
living
soul
there
was
always
the
possibility
of
a
stray
prospector
or
a
hunter
and
a
dry
garment
in
a
wet
time
is
a
temptation
which
should
not
be
put
in
any
man
way
neither
that
nor
the
liquor
supply
when
we
left
our
camp
as
we
did
often
our
guns
our
tackle
even
our
purses
and
watches
were
likely
to
be
scattered
about
in
plain
view
but
we
never
failed
to
hide
the
whisky
whisky
is
fair
loot
and
the
woodsman
who
would
scorn
to
steal
even
a
dry
shirt
would
carry
off
whisky
and
revel
in
his
shame
there
were
quantities
of
trout
in
the
lower
shelburne
and
in
a
pool
just
below
the
camp
next
morning
eddie
and
i
took
a
dozen
or
more
enough
for
breakfast
and
to
spare
in
a
very
few
minutes
they
were
lively
fish
rather
light
in
color
but
beautifully
marked
and
small
enough
to
be
sweet
and
tender
that
is
not
much
over
a
weight
in
fact
by
this
time
we
were
beginning
to
have
a
weakness
for
the
smaller
fish
the
trout
the
most
plentiful
size
thus
far
were
likely
to
be
rather
dry
and
none
too
tender
when
we
needed
a
food
supply
the
fish
were
more
welcome
and
when
as
happened
only
too
rarely
we
took
one
of
the
new
england
speckled
beauty
dimensions
that
is
to
say
a
trout
of
from
seven
to
nine
inches
long
and
of
a
few
ounces
weight
it
was
welcomed
with
real
joy
big
fish
are
a
satisfaction
at
the
end
of
a
line
and
in
the
landing
net
but
when
one
really
enters
upon
a
trout
diet
when
at
last
it
becomes
necessary
to
serve
them
in
six
or
seven
different
ways
to
make
them
go
down
the
demand
for
the
smallest
fish
obtainable
is
pretty
certain
to
develop
while
the
big
ones
are
promptly
returned
with
good
wishes
and
to
their
native
element
for
of
course
no
true
sportsman
ever
keeps
any
trout
he
can
not
use
only
the
does
that
a
trout
caught
on
a
fly
is
seldom
injured
and
if
returned
immediately
to
the
water
will
dart
away
all
the
happier
it
may
be
for
his
recent
he
suffers
little
or
no
pain
in
the
tough
cartilages
about
his
mouth
and
gills
a
fact
i
have
demonstrated
by
hooking
the
same
fish
twice
both
marks
plainly
showing
on
him
when
taken
and
the
new
kind
of
exercise
and
experience
he
gets
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
his
momentary
association
with
human
beings
constitute
for
him
a
valuable
asset
perhaps
to
be
retailed
in
the
form
of
reminiscence
throughout
old
age
but
to
fling
him
into
a
canoe
to
gasp
and
die
and
be
thrown
away
that
is
a
different
matter
that
is
a
crime
worse
than
stealing
a
man
lunch
or
his
last
dry
undershirt
or
even
his
whisky
in
the
first
place
kill
your
trout
the
moment
you
take
him
out
of
the
water
that
is
if
you
mean
to
eat
him
if
he
is
too
big
or
if
you
already
have
enough
put
him
back
with
all
expedition
and
let
him
swim
away
even
if
he
does
warn
the
other
trout
and
spoil
the
fishing
in
that
pool
there
are
more
pools
and
then
it
is
likely
you
have
fished
enough
in
that
one
anyway
come
back
next
year
and
have
another
battle
with
him
he
will
be
bigger
and
know
better
what
to
do
then
perhaps
it
will
be
his
turn
to
win
in
the
matter
of
killing
a
fish
there
are
several
ways
to
do
it
some
might
prefer
to
set
him
up
on
the
bank
and
shoot
at
him
another
way
would
be
to
brain
him
with
an
ax
the
guides
have
a
way
of
breaking
a
trout
neck
by
a
skillful
movement
which
i
never
could
duplicate
my
own
method
is
to
sever
the
vertebræ
just
back
of
the
ears
gills
i
mean
with
the
point
of
a
sharp
knife
it
is
quick
and
effective
i
do
know
why
i
am
running
on
with
digression
and
advice
this
way
perhaps
because
about
this
period
i
had
had
enough
experience
to
feel
capable
of
giving
advice
a
little
experience
breeds
a
lot
of
advice
i
knew
a
man
once
footnotes
the
publisher
wished
me
to
go
on
with
the
story
at
this
point
the
man
referred
to
above
got
his
experience
in
wall
street
he
got
enough
in
half
a
day
to
keep
him
in
advice
for
years
chapter
fourteen
never
a
voice
to
answer
here
never
a
face
to
see
chill
and
damp
we
build
our
the
hemlock
chapter
fourteen
in
spite
of
the
rains
the
waters
of
the
shelburne
were
too
low
at
this
point
to
descend
in
the
canoes
the
pools
were
pretty
small
affairs
and
the
rapids
long
shallow
and
very
ragged
it
is
good
sport
to
run
rapids
in
a
canoe
when
there
is
plenty
of
swift
water
and
a
fair
percentage
of
danger
but
these
were
dangerous
only
to
the
canoes
which
in
many
places
would
not
even
float
loaded
as
we
were
it
became
evident
that
the
guides
would
have
to
wade
and
drag
with
here
and
there
a
carry
to
get
the
boats
down
to
deeper
water
provided
always
there
deeper
water
which
we
did
not
doubt
eddie
and
i
set
out
ahead
and
having
had
our
morning
fishing
kept
pretty
well
to
the
bank
where
the
walking
was
fairly
good
we
felt
pleasant
and
comfortable
and
paid
not
much
attention
to
the
stream
except
where
a
tempting
pool
invited
a
cast
or
two
usually
with
prompt
returns
though
we
kept
only
a
few
smaller
fish
we
found
the
banks
more
attractive
men
had
seldom
disturbed
the
life
there
and
birds
sang
an
arm
length
away
or
regarded
us
quietly
without
distrust
here
and
there
a
hermit
thrush
the
sweetest
and
shyest
of
birds
himself
unseen
charmed
us
with
his
mellow
syllables
somehow
in
the
far
unfretted
removal
of
it
all
we
felt
at
peace
with
every
living
thing
and
when
a
partridge
suddenly
dropped
down
on
a
limb
not
three
yards
away
neither
of
us
offered
to
shoot
though
we
had
our
rifles
and
eddie
his
license
to
kill
and
skin
and
hence
to
eat
and
though
fish
were
at
a
discount
and
game
not
overplentiful
and
then
we
were
rewarded
by
a
curious
and
beautiful
exhibition
for
the
partridge
was
a
mother
bird
and
just
at
our
feet
there
was
a
peeping
and
a
scampering
of
little
brown
balls
that
disappeared
like
magic
among
the
leaves
her
fussy
furry
brood
i
do
think
she
mistrusted
our
intent
at
least
not
much
but
she
wanted
to
make
sure
she
was
not
fully
satisfied
to
have
us
remain
just
there
with
her
babies
hiding
not
two
yards
away
she
dropped
on
the
ground
herself
directly
in
front
of
us
so
close
that
one
might
almost
touch
her
and
letting
one
of
her
wings
fall
loosely
looked
back
at
us
over
her
shoulder
as
if
to
say
you
see
it
is
broken
if
you
wish
you
can
catch
me
easily
so
we
let
her
fool
us
at
least
we
let
her
believe
we
were
deceived
and
made
as
if
to
stoop
for
her
and
followed
each
time
when
she
ran
a
few
steps
farther
ahead
until
little
by
little
she
had
led
us
away
from
her
family
then
when
she
was
sure
that
we
really
did
not
want
her
or
her
chickens
but
cared
only
to
be
amused
she
ran
quickly
a
little
way
farther
and
disappeared
and
we
saw
her
no
more
within
a
minute
or
two
from
that
time
she
was
probably
back
with
her
little
folks
and
they
were
debating
as
to
whether
we
were
bird
or
beast
and
why
we
carried
that
curious
combination
of
smells
it
was
such
incidents
as
this
that
led
us
on
the
morning
was
gone
presently
and
we
had
no
means
of
knowing
how
far
we
had
come
it
seemed
to
us
but
a
short
way
we
forgot
the
windings
of
the
stream
some
of
which
we
had
eluded
by
and
how
many
hard
places
there
would
be
for
del
and
charlie
to
get
over
with
the
canoes
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
rather
expected
them
to
overtake
us
at
any
time
and
as
the
pools
became
deeper
and
longer
and
the
rapids
somewhat
more
navigable
we
feared
to
leave
the
stream
on
the
chance
of
being
passed
it
was
about
one
when
we
reached
a
really
beautiful
stretch
of
water
wide
and
deep
and
navigable
for
an
indefinite
distance
here
we
stopped
to
get
fish
for
luncheon
and
to
wait
for
the
boats
which
we
anticipated
at
any
moment
it
was
a
wonderful
place
to
fish
one
could
wade
out
and
get
long
casts
up
and
down
and
the
trout
rose
to
almost
any
fly
eddie
caught
a
white
perch
at
last
and
i
two
yellow
ones
not
very
plentiful
in
these
waters
and
most
desirable
from
the
food
point
of
view
the
place
seemed
really
inexhaustible
i
think
there
were
few
trout
larger
than
fourteen
inches
in
length
but
of
these
there
were
a
great
many
and
a
good
supply
of
the
speckled
beauty
size
when
we
had
enough
of
these
for
any
possible
luncheon
demand
and
were
fairly
weary
of
casting
and
reeling
in
we
suddenly
realized
that
we
were
hungry
also
that
it
was
well
into
the
afternoon
and
that
there
were
no
canoes
in
sight
furthermore
in
the
enthusiasm
of
the
sport
we
had
both
of
us
more
than
once
stepped
beyond
the
gunwales
of
our
waders
and
had
our
boots
full
of
water
besides
being
otherwise
wet
once
in
fact
i
had
slipped
off
a
log
on
all
fours
in
a
rather
deep
place
it
began
to
be
necessary
that
we
should
have
a
camp
and
be
fed
still
we
waited
hopefully
expecting
every
moment
to
see
the
canoes
push
around
the
bend
eventually
we
were
seized
with
misgivings
could
the
guides
have
met
with
shipwreck
in
some
desperate
place
and
disabled
one
or
both
of
the
canoes
perhaps
losing
our
stores
the
thought
was
depressing
was
it
possible
that
they
had
really
passed
us
during
some
period
when
we
had
left
the
water
and
were
now
far
ahead
we
could
not
believe
it
could
it
be
that
the
river
had
divided
at
some
unseen
point
and
that
we
had
followed
one
fork
and
they
another
it
did
not
seem
probable
perhaps
after
all
we
had
come
farther
than
we
believed
and
they
had
been
delayed
by
the
difficulties
of
navigation
but
when
another
hour
passed
and
they
did
not
appear
or
answer
to
our
calls
the
reason
for
their
delay
did
not
matter
we
were
wet
cold
and
hungry
food
and
fire
were
the
necessary
articles
we
had
not
a
scrap
of
food
except
our
uncooked
fish
and
it
would
be
no
easy
matter
without
ax
or
hatchet
to
get
a
fire
started
in
those
woods
also
we
had
no
salt
but
that
was
secondary
eddie
said
he
would
try
to
build
a
fire
if
i
would
clean
some
fish
but
this
proved
pretty
lonesome
work
for
both
of
us
we
decided
to
both
build
and
then
both
clean
the
fish
we
dug
down
under
the
leaves
for
dry
twigs
but
they
were
not
plentiful
then
we
split
open
some
dead
spruce
branches
and
got
a
few
resinous
slivers
from
the
heart
of
them
a
good
many
in
fact
and
we
patiently
gathered
bits
of
reasonably
dry
bark
and
branches
from
under
the
sheltered
side
of
logs
and
rocks
and
leaning
trees
we
meant
to
construct
our
fire
very
carefully
and
we
did
we
scooped
a
little
hollow
in
the
ground
for
draught
and
laid
in
some
of
the
drier
pieces
of
bark
upon
which
to
pile
our
spruce
slivers
upon
these
in
turn
we
laid
very
carefully
what
seemed
to
be
our
driest
selections
of
twigs
increasing
the
size
with
each
layer
until
we
laid
on
limbs
of
goodly
bulk
and
had
a
very
respectable
looking
heap
of
fuel
ready
for
lighting
on
the
windward
side
our
mistake
was
that
we
did
not
light
it
sooner
the
weight
of
our
larger
fuel
had
pressed
hard
upon
our
little
heap
of
spruce
slivers
and
flattened
it
when
it
should
have
remained
loose
and
quickly
inflammable
with
the
larger
fuel
lying
handy
to
be
added
at
the
proper
moment
as
it
was
the
tiny
blaze
had
a
habit
of
going
out
just
about
the
time
when
it
ought
to
have
been
starting
some
bigger
material
when
we
did
get
a
sickly
flame
going
up
through
the
little
damp
mess
of
stuff
there
was
a
good
deal
more
smoke
than
fire
and
we
were
able
to
keep
the
blaze
alive
only
by
energetic
encouragement
in
the
form
of
blowing
first
eddie
would
get
down
on
his
hands
with
his
chin
against
the
ground
and
blow
until
he
was
apoplectic
and
blind
with
smoke
and
then
i
would
take
my
turn
i
never
saw
two
men
so
anxious
over
a
little
measly
fire
in
my
life
we
almost
forgot
that
we
were
perishing
with
cold
and
hunger
ourselves
in
our
anxiety
to
keep
the
spark
of
life
in
that
fire
we
saved
the
puny
thing
finally
and
it
waxed
strong
then
we
put
in
a
good
deal
of
time
feeding
and
nursing
our
charge
and
making
it
warm
and
comfortable
before
we
considered
ourselves
and
how
did
the
ungrateful
thing
repay
us
by
filling
our
eyes
with
smoke
and
chasing
us
from
side
to
side
pursuing
us
even
behind
trees
to
blind
and
torture
us
with
its
acrid
smarting
vapors
in
fact
the
perversity
of
campfire
smoke
remains
one
of
the
unexplained
mysteries
i
have
seen
a
fire
properly
built
between
two
tents
with
good
draught
and
the
whole
wide
sky
to
hold
the
smoke
suddenly
send
a
column
of
suffocating
vapor
directly
into
the
door
of
the
tent
where
there
was
no
draught
no
room
no
demand
at
all
for
smoke
i
have
had
it
track
me
into
the
remotest
corner
of
my
and
have
found
it
waiting
for
me
when
i
came
up
for
a
breath
of
air
i
have
had
it
come
clear
around
the
tent
to
strangle
me
when
i
had
taken
refuge
on
the
back
side
i
have
had
it
follow
me
through
the
bushes
up
a
tree
over
a
cliff
as
i
was
saying
we
got
the
fire
going
after
that
the
rest
was
easy
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
cleaning
a
few
trout
sticking
them
on
sticks
and
fighting
the
smoke
fiend
with
one
hand
while
we
burnt
and
blackened
the
trout
a
little
with
the
other
and
ate
them
salt
fork
knife
everything
not
that
they
were
not
good
i
have
never
eaten
any
better
raw
unsalted
trout
anywhere
not
even
at
delmonico
illustration
it
all
in
a
day
camping
of
course
the
matter
of
getting
dry
and
warm
was
different
it
is
not
the
pleasantest
thing
in
the
world
even
by
a
very
respectable
fire
such
as
we
had
now
achieved
to
take
off
all
of
one
things
without
the
protection
of
a
tent
especially
when
the
woods
are
damp
and
trickly
and
there
is
a
still
small
breath
of
chill
wind
blowing
and
to
have
to
hop
and
skip
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
to
keep
the
circulation
going
while
your
things
are
on
a
limb
in
the
smoke
getting
scalded
and
fumigated
and
black
edged
here
and
there
where
the
flame
has
singed
up
high
it
all
in
a
day
camping
of
course
and
altogether
worth
while
but
when
the
shades
of
night
are
closing
in
and
one
is
still
doing
a
spectral
dance
about
a
dying
fire
in
a
wet
wood
on
a
stomach
full
of
raw
trout
then
the
camping
day
seems
pretty
long
and
there
is
pressing
need
of
other
diversion
it
was
well
toward
night
when
we
decided
that
our
clothes
were
scorched
enough
for
comfortable
wear
and
a
late
hour
it
was
for
the
june
days
in
the
north
woods
are
long
we
had
at
no
time
lost
sight
of
the
river
and
we
began
to
realize
the
positive
necessity
of
locating
our
guides
and
canoes
we
had
given
up
trying
to
understand
the
delay
we
decided
to
follow
back
up
the
river
until
we
found
them
or
until
we
reached
some
other
branch
which
they
might
have
chosen
it
was
just
as
we
were
about
to
begin
this
discouraging
undertaking
that
far
up
the
bend
we
heard
a
call
then
another
we
answered
both
together
and
in
the
reply
we
recognized
the
tones
of
charles
the
strong
presently
they
came
in
sight
each
dragging
a
canoe
over
the
last
riffle
just
above
the
long
hole
a
moment
later
we
had
hurried
back
to
meet
two
of
the
weariest
wettest
most
bedraggled
mortals
that
ever
poled
and
dragged
and
carried
canoe
all
day
they
had
been
pulling
and
lifting
loading
unloading
and
carrying
those
canoes
and
bags
and
baskets
over
the
shelburne
riffles
where
not
even
the
lightest
craft
could
float
how
long
had
been
the
distance
they
did
not
know
but
the
miles
had
been
sore
tedious
miles
and
they
had
eaten
nothing
more
than
a
biscuit
expecting
at
every
bend
to
find
us
waiting
it
was
proper
that
we
should
make
camp
now
at
the
first
inviting
place
we
offered
to
stop
right
there
where
our
fire
was
already
going
but
it
was
decided
that
the
ground
was
a
poor
selection
being
rather
low
we
piled
into
the
canoes
and
shot
down
the
long
hole
while
the
light
of
evening
was
fading
from
the
sky
several
hundred
yards
below
the
water
widened
and
the
bank
sloped
higher
it
seemed
an
attractive
spot
and
we
already
knew
the
fishing
in
these
waters
but
as
a
final
test
eddie
made
a
cast
as
we
rounded
tossing
his
flies
into
an
inviting
swirl
just
below
a
huge
bowlder
for
some
reason
we
had
put
on
three
flies
and
when
he
finally
got
his
mess
of
fish
into
the
net
there
were
three
trout
all
good
ones
one
on
each
fly
we
decided
to
camp
there
for
good
luck
and
to
stay
until
we
were
fully
repaired
for
travel
no
camp
was
ever
more
warmly
welcomed
or
ever
will
be
more
fondly
remembered
by
us
all
chapter

white
the
silver
moon
lo
i
lie
as
the
hours
go
by
to
death
in
chapter
fifteen
the
reader
will
have
gathered
by
this
time
that
i
had
set
out
with
only
a
hazy
idea
of
what
camping
in
nova
scotia
would
be
like
i
think
i
had
some
notion
that
our
beds
would
be
down
in
the
mud
as
often
as
not
and
sticky
and
disagreeable
something
to
be
endured
for
the
sake
of
the
day
sport
things
were
not
as
i
expected
of
course
things
never
are
our
beds
were
not
in
the
mud
not
often
and
there
were
days
chill
wet
disheartening
days
when
i
looked
forward
to
them
and
to
the
campfire
blaze
at
the
tent
door
with
that
comfort
which
a
child
finds
in
the
prospect
of
its
mother
arm
on
the
whole
i
am
sure
our
camps
were
more
commodious
than
i
had
expected
them
to
be
and
they
were
pretentious
affairs
considering
that
we
were
likely
to
occupy
them
no
more
than
one
night
we
had
three
tents
eddie
already
described
a
tent
for
the
guides
of
about
the
same
proportions
and
a
top
or
roof
tent
under
which
we
dined
when
it
rained
then
there
was
a
little
porch
arrangement
which
we
sometimes
put
out
over
the
front
but
we
found
it
had
the
bad
habit
of
inviting
the
smoke
to
investigate
and
permeate
our
quarters
so
we
dedicated
the
little
porch
fly
to
other
uses
a
waterproof
ground
cloth
was
spread
between
our
stretcher
beds
and
upon
the
latter
as
mentioned
before
were
our
also
our
various
bundles
cozily
and
conveniently
bestowed
it
was
an
inviting
interior
on
the
whole
something
to
anticipate
as
i
have
said
yet
our
beds
were
not
perfect
few
things
are
i
am
a
rather
large
man
and
about
three
in
the
morning
i
was
likely
to
wake
up
somewhat
cramped
and
pinched
together
from
being
so
long
in
the
little
canvas
trough
with
no
good
way
of
putting
out
my
arms
besides
being
a
little
cold
maybe
because
about
that
hour
the
temperature
seemed
to
make
a
specialty
of
dropping
low
enough
to
get
underneath
one
couch
and
creep
up
around
the
back
and
shoulders
it
is
true
it
was
june
but
june
nights
in
nova
scotia
have
a
way
of
forgetting
that
it
is
drowsy
scented
summertime
and
i
recall
now
times
when
i
looked
out
through
the
tent
flap
and
saw
the
white
frost
gleaming
on
the
trees
and
wondered
if
there
was
any
sum
of
money
too
big
to
exchange
for
a
dozen
blankets
or
so
and
if
on
the
whole
perishing
as
i
was
i
would
not
be
justified
in
drugging
eddie
in
taking
possession
of
his
he
had
already
given
me
one
of
the
woolen
pockets
for
compared
with
mine
his
was
a
genuine
arctic
affair
and
i
really
believe
kept
him
disgustingly
warm
even
when
i
was
freezing
i
was
grateful
of
course
for
i
should
have
perished
early
in
the
fight
without
it
i
was
also
appreciative
i
knew
just
how
much
warmer
a
few
more
of
those
soft
fleecy
pockets
would
make
me
especially
on
those
nights
when
i
woke
about
the
cheerless
hour
of
three
to
find
the
world
all
hard
and
white
with
the
frost
fingers
creeping
down
my
shoulder
blades
and
along
my
spine
then
it
was
i
would
work
around
and
around
slowly
and
with
due
deliberation
of
movement
for
a
is
not
a
thing
of
sudden
and
careless
revolution
trying
to
find
some
position
or
angle
wherein
the
cold
would
not
so
easily
and
surely
find
my
vitals
at
such
a
time
the
desire
for
real
comfort
and
warmth
is
acute
and
having
already
one
of
eddie
pockets
and
realizing
its
sterling
worth
also
that
no
more
than
two
feet
away
from
me
he
lay
warm
and
snug
buried
in
the
undue
luxury
of
still
other
pockets
i
may
confess
now
i
was
goaded
almost
to
the
point
of
arising
and
taking
peremptory
possession
of
the
few
paltry
pockets
that
would
make
my
lot
less
hard
illustration
nightly

painted
my
scratches
with

sooner
or
later
i
suppose
i
should
have
murdered
eddie
for
his
blankets
if
he
had
not
been
good
to
me
in
so
many
ways
daily
he
gave
me
leaders
lines
new
flies
and
such
things
nightly
he
painted
my
scratches
with
new
skin
on
the
slightest
provocation
he
would
have
rubbed
me
generously
with
liniment
for
he
had
a
new
unopened
bottle
which
he
was
dying
to
try
then
there
was
scarcely
an
evening
after
i
was
in
bed
i
was

go

to
prepare
his

unhurriedly

he
did
not
bring
me
a
drink
and
comfort
me
with
something
nice
to
eat
and
maybe
sing
a
little
while
he
was
tickling
his
own
bed
there
is
no
other
name
for
it

when
he
had
finished
with
the
countless
little
tappings
and
pattings
and
final
touches
which
insured
the
reposeful
comfort
of
his
couch
he
would
place
the
candle

just
between
where
each
could
see
equally
well
and
so
read

little
in
order
that
we
might

take
for
reading
in
the
woods
he
added
that
he
always
read
a
little
at
night
upon
retiring
and
from
his
manner
of
saying
it
i
assumed
that
such
reading
might
be
of
a
religious
nature
now
i
had
not
previously
thought
of
taking
anything
but
just
then
i
happened
to
notice
lying
upon
the
table
a
copy
of
alice
in
wonderland
evidently
belonging
to
the
premises
and
i
said
i
would
take
that
i
had
not
foregathered
with
alice
and
the
white
rabbit
for
a
good
while
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
the
depths
of
an
enchanted
wood
i
might
properly
and
profitably
renew
their
acquaintance
the
story
would
hardly
offend
eddie
even
while
he
was
finding
solace
in
his
i
was
only
vaguely
troubled
when
on
the
first
night
of
our
little
reading
exercise
i
noticed
that
eddie
book
was
not
of
the
sort
which
i
had
been
led
to
expect
but
was
a
rather
thick
affair
still
i
reflected
it
might
be
an
ecclesiastical
treatise
or
even
what
is
known
as
a
theological
novel
and
being
absorbed
just
then
in
an
endeavor
to
accompany
alice
into
the
wonderful
garden
i
did
not
investigate
what
was
my
surprise
my
shock
i
may
say
next
morning
on
picking
up
the
volume
to
discover
that
it
was
printed
in
a
foreign
language
and
that
language
french
always
a
suspicious
thing
in
print
and
to
learn
further
when
by
dint
of
recalling
old
school
exercises
i
had
spelled
out
the
author
name
and
a
sentence
here
and
there
that
not
only
was
it
in
that
suspicious
language
but
that
it
was
a
novel
and
of
a
sort
well
of
course
there
is
only
one
thing
worse
than
an
english
translation
of
a
french
novel
and
that
is
a
french
novel
which
can
not
be
translated
by
any
one
in
this
country
i
mean
who
hopes
to
keep
out
of
jail
i
became
absorbed
in
an
endeavor
to
unravel
a
passage
here
and
there
myself
but
my
french
training
had
not
fitted
me
for
the
task
my
lessons
had
been
all
about
the
silk
gloves
of
my
uncle
children
or
of
the
fine
leather
shoes
of
my
mother
aunt
and
such
innocent
things
i
could
find
no
reference
to
them
in
eddie
book
in
fact
i
found
on
almost
every
page
reference
to
things
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
wardrobe
of
any
sort
and
there
were
words
of
which
i
had
the
deepest
suspicion
i
was
tempted
to
fling
the
volume
from
me
with
a
burning
blush
of
shame
certainly
it
was
necessary
to
protest
against
the
introduction
of
the
baleful
french
novel
into
this
sylvan
retreat
i
did
so
later
in
the
day
but
it
was
no
use
eddie
had
already
gulped
down
some
twenty
pages
of
the
poison
and
would
not
listen
to
reason
there
was
a
duchess
in
the
book
and
i
knew
immediately
from
the
lame
excuses
he
made
for
this
person
that
she
was
not
at
all
a
proper
associate
for
eddie
especially
in
this
remote
place
i
pleaded
in
vain
he
had
overtaken
the
duchess
on
the
third
page
and
the
gaud
of
her
beauty
was
in
his
eyes
so
it
came
to
pass
that
while
i
was
following
gentle
little
alice
and
the
white
rabbit
through
a
land
of
wonder
and
dreams
eddie
by
the
light
of
the
same
candle
was
chasing
this
butterfly
of
folly
through
a
french
court
at
the
rate
of
some
twenty
finely
printed
pages
every
night
translating
aloud
here
and
there
until
it
sometimes
became
necessary
for
me
to
blow
out
the
candle
peremptorily
in
order
that
both
of
us
might
compose
our
minds
for
needed
slumber
perhaps
i
am
dwelling
unnecessarily
upon
our
camp
detail
but
after
all
the
tent
with
its
daily
and
nightly
round
becomes
a
rather
important
thing
when
it
is
to
be
a
habitation
for
a
period
of
weeks
of
sun
and
storm
and
any
little
gem
of
experience
may
not
be
wholly
unwasted
then
there
is
the
matter
of
getting
along
without
friction
which
seems
important
a
tent
is
a
small
place
and
is
likely
to
contain
a
good
many
things
especially
in
bad
weather
besides
yourselves
if
you
can
manage
to
have
your
things
so
the
other
fellow
will
stumble
over
them
as
infrequently
as
possible
it
is
just
as
well
for
him
and
safer
for
you
also
for
the
things
then
too
if
you
will
make
your
beds
at
separate
times
as
we
did
one
remaining
outside
or
lying
in
a
horizontal
position
among
his
own
supplies
while
the
other
is
in
active
operation
you
are
less
likely
to
rub
against
each
other
which
sometimes
means
to
rub
in
the
wrong
direction
with
unhappy
results
of
course
forbearance
is
not
a
bad
asset
to
have
along
and
a
small
measure
of
charity
and
consideration
it
is
well
to
take
one
sense
of
humor
too
and
any
little
remnant
of
imagination
one
may
have
lying
about
handy
at
the
moment
of
starting
many
a
camp
has
gone
to
wreck
during
a
spell
of
bad
weather
because
one
or
more
of
its
occupants
did
not
bring
along
imagination
and
a
sense
of
humor
or
failed
to
produce
these
articles
at
the
critical
moment
imagination
beautifies
many
a
desolate
outlook
a
laugh
helps
over
many
a
hard
place
chapter

the

chapter

we
established
a
good
camp
on
the
shelburne
and
remained
in
it
for
several
days
for
one
thing
our
canoes
needed
a
general
overhauling
after
that
hard
day
on
the
rocks
also
it
rained
nightly
and
now
and
then
took
a
turn
at
it
during
the
day
to
keep
in
practice
we
minded
the
rain
of
course
as
it
kept
us
forever
cooking
our
clothes
and
restrained
a
good
deal
of
activity
about
the
camp
still
we
argued
that
it
was
a
good
thing
for
there
was
no
telling
what
sort
of
water
lay
ahead
and
a
series
of
rapids
with
low
water
might
mean
trouble
on
the
whole
we
were
willing
to
stay
and
put
up
with
a
good
deal
for
the
sport
in
that
long
pool
there
may
be
better
fishing
on
earth
than
in
the
shelburne
river
between
irving
and
sand
lakes
but
it
will
take
something
more
than
mere
fisherman
gossip
to
convince
either
eddie
or
me
of
that
possibility
we
left
the
guides
and
went
out
together
one
morning
and
in
less
than
three
hours
had
taken
full
fifty
fish
of
a
pound
each
average
weight
we
took
off
our
top
flies
presently
and
fished
with
only
one
which
kept
us
busy
enough
and
always
one
of
us
had
a
taut
line
and
a
curved
rod
often
both
at
one
time
we
began
to
try
experiments
at
last
and
i
took
a
good
fish
on
one
of
the
funny
little
flies
i
had
happily
lost
the
jock
scott
with
two
hooks
early
in
the
campaign
and
finally
got
a
big
fellow
by
merely
tying
a
bit
of
white
absorbent
cotton
to
a
plain
black
hook
yet
curious
are
the
ways
of
fish
for
on
the
next
morning
a
perfect
trout
day
with
a
light
southwest
wind
and
running
clouds
after
a
night
of
showers
never
a
rise
could
we
get
we
tried
all
the
casts
of
the
day
before
the
parmcheenie
the
jenny
lind
the
silver
doctor
and
the
brown
hackle
it
was
no
use
perhaps
the
half
a
hundred
big
fellows
we
had
returned
to
the
pool
had
warned
all
the
others
perhaps
there
was
some
other
unwritten
occult
law
which
prohibited
trout
from
feasting
on
this
particular
day
finally
eddie
by
some
chance
put
on
a
sort
of
a
brown
hackle
affair
with
a
red
piece
of
wool
for
a
tail
he
called
it
a
red
tag
fly
i
think
and
straightway
from
out
of
the
tarry
black
depths
there
rose
such
a
trout
as
neither
of
us
had
seen
the
day
before
after
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
eddie
fishing
what
there
was
about
this
brown
joke
that
tickled
the
fancy
of
those
great
silly
trout
who
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
other
lure
is
not
for
me
to
say
the
creature
certainly
looked
like
nothing
that
ever
lived
or
that
they
could
ever
have
imagined
before
it
seemed
to
me
a
particularly
idiotic
combination
and
i
could
feel
my
respect
for
the
intelligence
of
trout
waning
eddie
agreed
with
me
as
to
that
he
said
he
had
merely
bought
the
thing
because
it
happened
to
be
the
only
fly
he
did
have
in
his
collection
and
there
had
been
a
vacant
place
in
his
he
said
it
was
funny
the
trout
should
go
for
it
as
they
did
and
he
laughed
a
good
deal
about
it
i
suppose
it
was
funny
but
i
did
not
find
it
very
amusing
and
how
those
trout
did
act
in
vain
i
picked
out
flies
with
the
red
and
brown
colors
and
tossed
them
as
carefully
as
i
could
in
just
the
same
spots
where
eddie
was
getting
those
great
whoppers
at
every
cast
some
mysterious
order
from
the
high
priest
of
all
trout
had
gone
forth
that
morning
prohibiting
every
sort
and
combination
of
trout
food
except
this
absurd
creature
of
which
the
oldest
and
mossiest
trout
had
never
dreamed
that
was
why
they
went
for
it
it
was
the
only
thing
not
down
on
the
list
of
proscribed
items
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
at
last
but
to
paddle
eddie
around
and
watch
him
do
some
of
the
most
beautiful
fishing
i
have
ever
seen
and
to
net
his
trout
for
him
and
take
off
the
fish
and
attend
to
any
other
little
wants
incident
to
a
fisherman
busy
day
i
did
it
with
as
good
grace
as
i
could
of
course
and
said
i
enjoyed
it
and
tried
not
to
be
nasty
and
disagreeable
in
my
attitude
toward
the
trout
the
water
eddie
and
the
camp
and
country
in
general
but
after
all
it
is
a
severe
test
on
a
day
like
that
to
cast
and
cast
and
change
flies
until
you
have
wet
every
one
in
your
book
without
even
a
rise
and
to
see
the
other
chap
taking
great
big
black
and
mottled
fellows
to
see
his
rod
curved
like
a
whip
and
to
watch
the
long
lithe
body
leaping
and
gleaming
in
the
net
but
the
final
test
the
climax
was
to
come
at
evening
for
when
the
fish
would
no
longer
rise
even
to
the
red
tag
we
pulled
up
to
the
camp
where
eddie
of
course
reported
to
the
guides
his
triumph
and
my
discomfiture
then
just
as
he
was
opening
his
to
put
the
precious
mockery
away
he
suddenly
stopped
and
stared
at
me
hesitated
and
held
up
another
that
is
two
of
them
side
by
side
so
help
me
he
swore
i
did
know
i
had
it
i
must
have
forgotten
i
had
one
and
bought
another
at
another
time
now
i
had
forgotten
that
too
so
help
me
if
i
had
known
eddie
so
well
his
proclivity
for
buying
and
forgetting
and
buying
over
again
also
his
sterling
honor
and
general
moral
purity
the
fishes
would
have
got
him
then
red
tag
and
all
as
it
was
i
condescended
to
accept
the
second
fly
i
agreed
that
it
was
not
such
a
bad
production
after
all
though
i
altered
my
opinion
again
next
morning
for
whatever
had
been
the
embargo
laid
on
other
varieties
of
trout
bait
the
day
before
it
was
on
now
and
there
was
a
general
rising
to
anything
we
offered
doctors
parmcheenie
absorbent
cotton
any
old
thing
that
skimmed
the
water
and
looked
big
and
succulent
we
broke
camp
that
morning
and
dropped
down
toward
the
next
lake
sand
lake
it
would
be
by
our
crude
map
and
hazy
directions
there
are
no
better
rapids
and
there
is
no
more
lively
fishing
than
we
had
on
that
run
there
was
enough
water
for
us
to
remain
in
the
canoes
and
it
was
for
the
most
part
whirling
swirling
dashing
leaping
water
shooting
between
great
bowlders
plunging
among
black
rocks
foaming
into
whirlpools
below
that
looked
ready
to
swamp
our
light
craft
with
stores
crew
tackle
everything
it
was
my
first
exhibition
of
our
guides
skill
in
handling
their
canoes
how
they
managed
to
just
evade
a
sharp
point
of
rock
on
one
side
and
by
a
quick
twist
escape
shipwreck
from
a
bowlder
or
mass
of
bowlders
on
the
other
i
fail
to
comprehend
then
there
were
narrow
boiling
channels
so
full
of
obstructions
that
i
did
not
believe
a
chip
could
go
through
with
entire
safety
yet
somehow
del
the
stout
and
charles
the
strong
seemed
to
know
though
they
had
never
traveled
this
water
before
just
where
the
water
would
let
the
boats
pass
just
where
the
stones
were
wide
enough
to
let
us
through
touching
on
both
sides
sometimes
and
ominously
scraping
on
the
bottom
but
sliding
and
teetering
into
the
cauldron
below
where
somehow
we
did
not
perish
perhaps
because
we
shot
so
quickly
through
the
foam
in
the
beginning
i
remembered
a
few
brief
and
appropriate
prayers
from
a
childhood
where
such
things
were
a
staff
of
comfort
and
so
made
my
peace
with
the
world
each
time
before
we
took
the
desperate
plunge
but
as
nothing
seemed
to
happen
nothing
fatal
i
mean
i
presently
gave
myself
up
to
the
pure
enjoyment
of
the
tumult
and
exhilaration
without
disturbing
myself
as
to
dangers
here
or
hereafter
i
do
not
believe
the
times
that
the
guides
got
out
of
the
canoes
to
ease
them
over
hard
places
would
exceed
twice
and
not
oftener
than
that
were
we
called
on
to
assist
them
with
the
paddles
even
when
we
wished
to
do
so
we
were
often
requested
to
go
on
fishing
for
the
reason
i
suppose
that
in
such
a
place
one
unskilled
efforts
are
likely
to
be
misdirected
with
fatal
results
somewhat
later
we
were
to
have
an
example
of
this
kind
but
i
anticipate
we
went
on
fishing
i
never
saw
so
many
fish
we
could
take
them
as
we
shot
a
rapid
we
could
scoop
them
in
as
we
leaped
a
fall
they
seemed
to
be
under
every
stone
and
lying
in
wait
there
were
great
black
fellows
in
every
maelstrom
there
were
groups
holding
receptions
for
us
in
the
stillwater
pools
below
it
is
likely
that
that
bit
of
the
shelburne
river
had
not
been
fished
before
within
the
memory
of
any
trout
then
living
and
when
those
red
and
blue
and
yellow
flies
came
tumbling
at
them
they
must
have
thought
it
was
great
day
in
the
morning
and
that
the
prophets
of
big
feeding
had
come
for
years
the
trout
we
returned
to
those
pools
will
tell
their
friends
and
descendants
of
the
marvels
and
enchantments
of
that
day
i
had
given
up
my
noibwood
as
being
too
strenuous
in
its
demands
for
constant
fishing
but
i
laid
aside
the
light
bamboo
here
in
this
current
and
with
this
fishing
where
trout
sometimes
leaped
clear
of
the
water
for
the
fly
cast
on
the
foam
far
ahead
to
be
swinging
a
moment
later
at
the
end
of
the
line
almost
as
far
behind
no
very
delicate
rod
would
improve
under
a
strain
like
that
and
the
tough
old
noibwood
held
true
and
nobody
cared
at
least
i
did
whether
the
tip
stayed
set
or
not
it
was
bent
double
most
of
the
time
anyway
and
the
rest
of
the
time
did
matter
i
do
know
how
many
fish
i
took
that
day
but
eddie
kept
count
of
his
and
recorded
a
total
of
between
camp
and
the
great
splendid
pool
where
the
shelburne
foams
out
into
sand
lake
four
miles
or
such
a
matter
below
i
do
know
that
we
lost
two
landing
nets
in
that
swift
water
one
apiece
and
this
was
a
serious
matter
for
there
were
but
two
more
both
eddie
and
landing
nets
in
the
wilderness
are
not
easy
to
replace
of
fish
we
kept
possibly
a
dozen
the
smallest
ones
the
others
larger
and
wiser
now
are
still
frolicking
in
the
waters
of
the
shelburne
unless
some
has
found
his
way
to
that
fine
water
which
i
think
doubtful
for
a
is
usually
too
lazy
and
too
stingy
to
spend
the
effort
and
time
and
money
necessary
to
get
there
chapter
eighteen
nothing
that
worse
for
sport
i
guess
killing
to
throw
away
there
nothing
that
better
for
having
a
price
to
chapter
eighteen
we
had
other
camp
diversions
besides
reading
we
had
shooting
matches
almost
daily
one
canoe
against
the
other
usually
at
any
stop
we
happened
to
make
whether
for
luncheon
or
to
repair
the
canoes
or
merely
to
prospect
the
country
on
rainy
days
and
sometimes
in
the
evening
we
played
a
game
of
cards
known
under
various
names
i
believe
we
called
it
pedro
at
all
events
you
bid
and
buy
and
get
set
back
and
have
less
when
you
get
through
than
you
had
before
you
began
anyhow
that
is
what
my
canoe
did
on
sundry
occasions
i
am
still
convinced
that
del
and
i
played
better
cards
than
the
other
canoe
though
the
score
would
seem
to
show
a
different
result
we
were
brilliant
and
speculative
in
our
playing
they
were
plodders
and
not
really
in
our
class
genius
and
dash
are
wasted
on
such
persons
i
am
equally
certain
that
our
shooting
was
much
worse
than
theirs
though
the
percentage
of
misses
seemed
to
remain
in
their
favor
in
the
matter
of
whenever
such
accidents
came
along
they
happened
to
the
other
canoe
but
perhaps
this
excited
our
opponents
for
there
followed
periods
of
wildness
when
if
their
shots
struck
anywhere
it
was
impossible
to
identify
the
places
at
such
periods
eddie
was
likely
to
claim
that
the
cartridges
were
blanks
and
perhaps
they
were
as
for
del
and
me
our
luck
never
varied
like
that
it
remained
about
equally
bad
from
day
to
day
just
bad
enough
to
beat
the
spectacular
fortunes
of
eddie
and
charles
the
strong
in
the
matter
of
however
that
is
to
say
shooting
when
we
were
on
the
wing
and
any
legitimate
quarry
came
in
view
my
recollection
is
that
we
ranked
about
alike
neither
of
us
by
any
chance
ever
hit
anything
at
all
and
i
have
an
impression
that
our
misses
were
about
equally
wide
eddie
may
make
a
different
claim
he
may
claim
that
he
fired
oftener
and
with
less
visible
result
than
i
possibly
he
did
fire
oftener
for
he
had
a
repeating
rifle
and
i
only
a
single
shot
but
so
far
as
the
result
is
concerned
if
he
states
that
his
bullets
flew
wider
of
the
mark
such
a
claim
is
the
result
of
pure
envy
perhaps
malice
why
i
recall
one
instance
of
a
muskrat
whose
skin
eddie
was
particularly
desirous
of
sending
to
those
museum
folks
in
london
all
properly
mounted
with
their
names
eddie
and
the
muskrat
on
a
neat
silver
plate
so
that
it
could
stand
there
and
do
honor
to
us
for
a
long
time
until
the
moths
had
eaten
up
everything
but
the
plate
perhaps
and
eddie
struck
the
water
within
two
or
three
feet
of
it
the
muskrat
of
course
as
much
as
a
dozen
times
while
such
shots
as
i
let
go
hit
anything
but
the
woods
or
the
sky
and
are
i
suppose
still
buried
somewhere
in
the
quiet
bosom
of
nature
i
am
glad
to
unload
that
sentence
it
was
getting
with
a
muskrat
and
moths
and
a
silver
plate
in
it
i
could
shoot
some
holes
in
it
with
a
little
practice
but
inasmuch
as
we
did
get
the
muskrat
i
will
let
it
stand
as
a
stuffed
specimen
i
am
also
glad
about
the
muskrat
had
he
perished
our
pledge
would
have
compelled
us
to
eat
him
and
although
one
of
eddie
told
a
good
deal
about
their
food
value
and
seven
different
ways
of
cooking
them
i
was
averse
to
experimenting
even
with
one
way
i
have
never
really
cared
for
muskrats
since
as
a
lad
i
caught
twenty
of
them
one
night
in
a
trammel
net
up
to
that
hour
the
odor
of
musk
had
never
been
especially
offensive
to
me
but
twenty
muskrats
in
a
net
can
compound
a
good
deal
of
perfumery
we
had
to
bury
the
net
and
even
then
i
never
cared
much
about
it
afterwards
the
sight
of
it
stirred
my
imagination
and
i
was
glad
when
it
was
ripped
away
from
us
by
a
swift
current
one
dark
night
it
being
unlawful
to
set
a
trammel
net
in
that
river
and
therefore
sinful
by
daylight
it
was
on
sand
lake
that
eddie
gave
the
first
positive
demonstration
of
his
skill
as
a
marksman
here
he
actually
made
a
killing
true
it
was
not
a
wing
shot
but
it
was
a
performance
worthy
of
record
a
chill
wet
wind
blew
in
upon
us
as
we
left
the
river
and
a
mist
such
as
we
had
experienced
on
irving
lake
with
occasional
drifts
of
rain
shut
us
in
at
first
it
was
hard
to
be
certain
that
we
were
really
on
a
lake
for
the
sheet
of
water
was
long
and
narrow
and
it
might
be
only
a
widening
of
the
river
but
presently
we
came
to
an
island
and
this
we
accepted
as
identification
it
was
the
customary
island
larger
than
some
but
with
the
bushes
below
the
sentinel
pines
and
here
and
there
a
gaunt
old
snag
bleached
and
dead
and
lifting
its
arms
to
the
sky
on
one
of
these
dead
ones
we
made
out
through
the
mist
a
strange
dark
bunch
about
the
size
of
a
barn
door
and
of
rather
irregular
formation
gradually
nearing
we
discovered
the
bunch
to
be
owls
great
horned
owls
a
family
of
them
grouped
on
the
old
tree
limbs
in
solid
formation
oblivious
to
the
rain
to
the
world
to
any
thought
of
approaching
danger
now
the
great
horned
owl
is
legitimate
quarry
the
case
against
him
is
that
he
is
a
bird
of
prey
a
destroyer
of
smaller
birds
and
an
enemy
of
hen
roosts
of
course
if
one
wanted
to
go
deeply
into
the
ethics
of
the
matter
one
might
say
that
the
smaller
birds
and
the
chickens
are
destroyers
too
of
bugs
and
grasshoppers
and
things
and
that
a
life
is
a
life
whether
it
be
a
bird
or
a
or
even
a
but
it
hard
to
get
to
the
end
of
such
speculations
as
that
besides
the
owl
was
present
and
we
wanted
his
skin
eddie
crept
close
in
with
his
canoe
and
drew
a
careful
bead
on
the
center
of
the
barn
door
there
was
an
angry
little
spit
of
powder
in
the
wet
a
wavering
movement
of
the
dark
bunch
a
slow
heaving
of
ghostly
pinions
and
four
silent
feathered
phantoms
drifted
away
into
the
white
gloom
but
there
was
one
that
did
not
follow
in
vain
the
dark
wings
heaved
and
fell
then
there
came
a
tottering
movement
a
leap
forward
and
the
heavy
body
came
swishing
to
the
ground
yet
unused
to
the
battle
as
he
was
for
he
was
of
the
younger
brood
he
died
game
when
we
reached
him
he
was
sitting
upright
glaring
out
of
his
great
yellow
eyes
his
talons
poised
for
defense
even
with
bottle
of
new
skin
in
reserve
it
was
not
considered
safe
to
approach
too
near
we
photographed
him
as
best
we
could
and
then
a
shot
at
close
range
closed
his
brief
career
i
examined
the
owl
with
considerable
interest
in
the
first
place
i
had
never
seen
one
of
this
noble
species
before
and
this
was
a
beautiful
specimen
also
his
flesh
being
that
of
a
young
bird
did
not
appeal
to
warrant
the
expression
tough
as
a
boiled
owl
which
the
others
remembered
almost
in
a
chorus
when
i
referred
to
our
agreement
concerning
the
food
test
of
such
game
as
we
brought
down
i
do
think
any
of
us
wanted
to
eat
that
owl
i
know
i
did
but
i
had
weakened
once
on
the
porcupine
it
may
be
remembered
and
the
death
of
that
porcupine
rested
heavily
upon
me
especially
when
i
remembered
how
he
had
whined
and
grieved
in
the
moment
of
dying
i
think
i
had
a
notion
that
eating
the
owl
would
in
some
measure
atone
for
the
porcupine
i
said
with
such
firmness
as
i
could
command
and
all
day
i
repeated
at
intervals
that
we
would
eat
the
owl
we
camped
rather
early
that
afternoon
for
it
was
not
pleasant
traveling
in
the
chill
mist
and
the
prospect
of
the
campfire
and
a
snug
tent
was
an
temptation
i
had
suggested
also
that
we
ought
to
go
ashore
in
time
to
cook
the
owl
for
supper
it
might
take
time
to
cook
him
we
did
not
especially
need
the
owl
we
had
saved
a
number
of
choice
small
trout
and
we
were
still
able
to
swallow
them
when
prepared
in
a
really
palatable
form
eddie
it
is
true
had
condemned
trout
at
breakfast
and
declared
he
would
have
no
more
of
them
but
this
may
have
been
because
there
were
flapjacks
he
showed
no
disposition
to
condemn
them
now
when
i
mentioned
the
nice
tender
owl
meat
which
we
were
to
have
he
really
looked
longingly
at
the
trout
and
spoke
of
them
as
juicy
little
fellows
such
as
he
had
always
liked
i
agreed
that
they
would
be
good
for
the
first
course
and
that
a
bird
for
supper
would
make
out
a
sumptuous
meal
i
have
never
known
eddie
to
be
so
kind
to
me
as
he
was
about
this
time
he
offered
me
some
leaders
and
flies
and
even
presented
me
with
a
pipe
brought
all
the
way
from
london
i
took
the
things
but
i
did
not
soften
my
heart
i
was
born
in
new
england
and
have
a
conscience
i
can
not
be
bribed
like
that
i
told
the
guides
that
it
would
be
better
to
begin
supper
right
away
in
order
that
we
might
not
get
too
hungry
before
the
owl
was
done
i
thought
them
slow
in
their
preparations
for
the
meal
it
was
curious
too
for
i
had
promised
them
they
should
have
a
piece
of
the
bird
del
was
generous
he
said
he
would
give
his
to
charles
that
he
never
really
cared
much
for
birds
anyhow
why
once
he
said
he
shot
a
partridge
and
gave
it
away
and
he
was
hungry
too
he
gave
it
to
a
boy
that
happened
along
just
then
and
when
another
partridge
flew
up
he
even
offer
to
shoot
it
we
did
take
much
stock
in
that
story
until
it
dawned
upon
us
that
he
had
shot
the
bird
out
of
season
and
the
boy
had
happened
along
just
in
time
to
be
incriminated
by
accepting
it
as
a
present
it
was
better
to
have
him
as
a
partner
than
a
witness
as
for
charles
he
affected
to
be
really
eager
for
owl
meat
he
said
that
all
his
life
he
had
looked
forward
to
this
time
still
he
was
slow
i
thought
he
seemed
about
as
eager
for
supper
as
a
boy
is
to
carry
in
the
evening
wood
he
said
that
one
of
the
canoes
leaked
a
little
and
ought
to
be
pitched
right
away
i
said
it
was
altogether
too
damp
for
such
work
and
that
the
canoe
would
wait
till
morning
then
he
wanted
to
look
up
a
spring
though
there
were
two
or
three
in
plain
sight
within
twenty
yards
of
the
camp
i
suspected
at
last
that
he
was
not
really
anxious
to
cook
the
owl
and
was
trying
to
postpone
the
matter
until
it
was
too
late
for
him
the
owl
to
get
properly
done
before
bedtime
then
i
became
firm
i
said
that
a
forest
agreement
was
sacred
that
we
were
pledged
to
the
owl
before
we
shot
him
and
that
we
would
keep
our
promise
to
the
dead
even
to
the
picking
of
his
bones
wood
was
gathered
then
and
the
fire
blazed
the
owl
breast
fat
and
fine
it
looked
was
in
the
broiler
and
on
the
fire
there
it
cooked
and
cooked
then
it
cooked
some
more
and
sent
up
an
appetizing
smell
now
and
then
i
said
i
thought
the
time
for
it
had
come
but
there
was
a
burden
of
opinion
that
more
cooking
would
benefit
the
owl
meantime
we
had
eaten
a
pan
or
two
of
trout
and
a
few
other
things
the
bird
of
course
being
later
in
the
bill
of
fare
at
most
dinners
i
have
attended
this
course
is
contemplated
with
joy
it
did
not
seem
to
be
on
this
occasion
eddie
agreed
with
del
that
he
had
never
cared
much
for
bird
anyway
and
urged
me
to
take
his
share
i
refused
to
deprive
him
of
it
then
he
said
he
did
feel
well
and
thought
he
really
ought
not
to
eat
anything
more
i
said
grimly
that
possibly
this
was
true
but
that
he
would
eat
the
owl
it
was
served
then
fairly
divided
and
distributed
as
food
is
when
men
are
on
short
rations
i
took
the
first
taste
i
was
always
venturesome
a
little
one
then
immediately
i
wished
i
had
accepted
eddie
piece
but
meantime
he
had
tasted
too
a
miserly
taste
and
then
i
could
have
got
the
rest
of
it
for
money
for
there
was
never
anything
so
good
as
that
breast
of
young
owl
it
was
tender
it
was
juicy
it
was
as
delicately
flavored
as
a
partridge
almost
certainly
it
was
a
dainty
morsel
to
us
who
had
of
late
dealt
so
largely
in
fish
diet
had
we
known
where
the
rest
of
that
brood
of
owls
had
flown
to
we
should
have
started
after
them
then
and
there
extract
from
my
diary
that
night
eddie
has
been
taken
with
a
slight
cramp
and
it
has
occurred
to
him
that
the
owl
meat
though
appetizing
may
be
poisonous
he
is
searching
his
medicine
bag
for
remedies
his
disaster
is
merely
punishment
for
the
quantity
of
other
food
he
ate
beforehand
in
his
futile
effort
to
escape
the
owl

found

on

i
thought
this

does
not

to
go
galloping
up

down
among
the
bushes
and

to
get

may

of

below

a
brook
was
said
to
enter
descending
from
the
upper
interior
country
it
would
lead
us
back
into
regions
more
remote
than
any
heretofore
traveled
so
far
as
i
could
learn
neither
of
our
guides
had
ever
met
any
one
who
even
claimed
in
know
this
region
always
excepting
the
imaginative
indian
previously
mentioned
somewhere
in
these
uncharted
wilds
this
indian
person
had
taken
trout
the
size
of
one
leg
regardless
of
the
dimensions
of
this
story
it
had
a
fascination
for
us
we
wished
to
see
those
trout
even
if
they
had
been
overrated
we
had
been
hurrying
at
least
in
spirit
to
reach
the
little
water
gateway
that
opened
to
a
deeper
unknown
where
lay
a
chain
of
lakes
vaguely
set
down
on
our
map
as
the
tobeatic
waters
at
some
time
in
the
past
the
region
had
been
lumbered
but
most
of
the
men
who
cut
the
timber
were
probably
dead
now
leaving
only
a
little
drift
of
hearsay
testimony
behind
it
was
not
easy
to
find
the
entrance
to
the
hidden
land
the
foliage
was
heavy
and
close
along
the
swampy
shore
and
from
such
an
ambush
a
still
small
current
might
flow
unnoticed
especially
in
the
mist
that
hung
about
us
more
than
once
we
were
deceived
by
some
fancied
ripple
or
the
configuration
of
the
shore
del
at
length
announced
that
just
ahead
was
a
growth
of
a
kind
of
maple
likely
to
indicate
a
brook
entrance
the
shore
really
divided
there
and
a
sandy
waterway
led
back
somewhere
into
a
mystery
of
vines
and
trees
we
halted
near
the
mouth
of
the
little
stream
for
lunch
and
consultation
it
was
not
a
desirable
place
to
camp
the
ground
was
low
and
oozy
and
full
of
plants
the
recent
rains
had
not
improved
the
character
of
the
place
there
was
poison
ivy
there
too
and
a
delegation
of
mosquitoes
we
might
just
as
well
have
gone
up
the
brook
a
hundred
yards
or
so
to
higher
and
healthier
ground
but
this
would
not
have
been
in
accord
with
eddie
ideas
of
exploration
explorers
he
said
always
stopped
at
the
mouth
of
rivers
to
debate
and
to
consult
maps
and
feed
themselves
in
preparation
for
unknown
hardships
to
come
so
we
stopped
and
sat
around
in
the
mud
and
looked
at
some
marks
on
a
paper
made
by
the
imaginative
indian
i
think
and
speculated
as
to
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
push
and
drag
the
canoes
up
the
brook
or
whether
everything
would
have
to
go
overland
personally
the
prospect
of
either
did
not
fill
me
with
enthusiasm
the
size
of
the
brook
did
not
promise
much
in
the
way
of
important
waters
above
or
fish
even
the
size
of
one
arm
however
tobeatic
exploration
was
down
on
the
cards
our
trip
thus
far
had
furnished
only
a
hint
of
such
mystery
and
sport
as
was
supposed
to
lie
concealed
somewhere
beyond
the
green
from
which
only
this
little
brooklet
crept
out
to
whisper
the
secret
besides
i
had
learned
to
keep
still
when
eddie
had
set
his
heart
on
a
thing
i
left
the
others
poring
over
the
hieroglyphic
map
and
waded
out
into
the
clean
water
of
the
brook
as
i
looked
back
at
del
and
charlie
squatting
there
amid
the
rank
weeds
under
the
dark
dripping
boughs
with
eddie
looking
over
their
shoulders
and
pointing
at
the
crumpled
paper
spread
before
them
they
formed
a
picturesque
group
such
a
one
as
livingstone
or
stanley
and
their
followers
might
have
made
in
the
african
jungles
when
i
told
eddie
of
this
he
grew
visibly
prouder
and
gave
me
two
new
leaders
and
some
special
tobacco
we
proceeded
up
the
stream
eddie
and
i
ahead
the
guides
pushing
the
loaded
canoes
behind
it
was
the
brook
of
our
forefathers
such
a
stream
as
might
flow
through
the
valley
meadows
of
new
england
with
trout
of
about
the
new
england
size
and
plentiful
lively
fellows
from
seven
to
nine
inches
in
length
rose
two
and
three
at
almost
every
cast
we
put
on
small
flies
and
light
leaders
and
forgot
there
were
such
things
as
big
trout
in
nova
scotia
it
was
joyous
fishing
a
real
treat
for
a
change
we
had
not
much
idea
how
far
we
were
to
climb
this
water
stairway
and
as
the
climb
became
steeper
and
the
water
more
swift
the
guides
pushed
and
puffed
and
we
gave
them
a
lift
over
the
hard
places
that
is
eddie
did
i
was
too
tired
to
do
anything
but
fish
as
a
rule
the
water
was
shallow
but
there
were
deep
holes
i
found
one
of
them
presently
by
mistake
it
was
my
habit
to
find
holes
that
way
places
deeper
than
my
waders
though
the
latter
came
to
my
shoulders
it
seemed
necessary
that
several
times
daily
i
should
get
my
boots
full
of
water
when
i
could
do
it
in
any
other
way
i
would
fall
over
something
and
let
the
river
run
into
them
for
a
while
i
called
to
eddie
from
where
i
was
wallowing
around
trying
to
get
up
with
my
usual
ballast
do
get
in
here
i
said
he
was
helping
the
boys
over
a
hard
place
just
then
tugging
and
sweating
but
he
paused
long
enough
to
be
rude
and
discourteous
i
do
have
to
catch
my
trout
in
my
boots
he
jeered
and
the
guides
were
disrespectful
enough
to
laugh
i
decided
that
i
would
never
try
to
do
any
of
them
a
good
turn
again
then
suddenly
everything
was
forgotten
for
a
gate
of
light
opened
out
ahead
and
presently
we
pushed
through
and
had
reached
the
shores
of
as
lovely
a
sheet
of
water
as
lies
in
the
great
north
woods
it
was
tupper
lake
by
our
calculation
and
it
was
on
the
opposite
side
that
tobeatic
brook
was
said
to
enter
there
if
anywhere
we
might
expect
to
find
the
traditional
trout
so
far
as
we
knew
no
one
had
looked
on
these
waters
since
the
old
lumbering
days
except
for
exploration
there
was
no
reason
why
any
one
should
come
of
fish
and
game
there
were
plenty
in
localities
more
accessible
to
me
i
believe
the
greatest
joy
there
as
everywhere
in
the
wilderness
and
it
was
a
joy
that
did
not
grow
old
was
the
feeling
that
we
were
in
a
region
so
far
removed
from
clanging
bells
and
grinding
wheels
and
all
the
useful
ugly
attributes
of
mankind
we
put
out
across
the
lake
the
land
rose
rather
sharply
beyond
and
from
among
the
trees
there
tumbled
out
a
white
foaming
torrent
that
made
a
wide
swirling
green
pool
where
it
entered
we
swept
in
below
this
aquarium
eddie
taking
one
side
and
i
the
other
we
had
on
our
big
flies
now
and
our
heavy
leaders
they
were
necessary
scarcely
had
a
cast
gone
sailing
out
over
the
twisting
water
when
a
big
black
and
gold
shape
leaped
into
the
air
and
eddie
had
his
work
cut
out
for
him
a
moment
later
my
own
reel
was
singing
and
i
knew
by
the
power
and
savage
rushes
that
i
had
something
unusual
at
the
other
end
trout
as
big
as
your
leg
we
called
across
to
each
other
and
if
they
were
not
really
as
big
as
that
they
were
at
all
events
bigger
than
anything
so
far
taken
as
big
as
one
arm
perhaps
one
forearm
at
least
from
the
hollow
of
the
elbow
to
the
fingertips
you
see
how
impossible
it
is
to
tell
the
truth
about
a
trout
the
first
time
i
never
knew
a
fisherman
who
could
do
it
there
is
something
about
a
fish
that
does
not
affiliate
with
fact
even
at
the
market
i
have
known
a
fish
to
weigh
more
than
he
did
when
i
got
him
home
we
considered
the
imaginative
indian
justified
and
blessed
him
accordingly
footnotes
pronounced
chapter
twenty
may
slip
away
from
a
faithful
thrive
for
an
hour
or
two
you
better
be
fair
and
you
better
be
square
something
will
happen
to
chapter
twenty
we
took
seventeen
of
those
big
fellows
before
we
landed
enough
in
all
conscience
a
point
just
back
of
the
water
looked
inviting
as
a
place
to
pitch
the
tents
and
we
decided
to
land
for
we
were
tired
yet
curious
are
the
ways
of
fishermen
having
had
already
too
much
one
becomes
greedy
for
still
more
there
was
an
old
dam
just
above
unused
for
a
generation
perhaps
and
a
long
rotting
sluiceway
through
which
poured
a
torrent
of
water
it
seemed
just
the
place
for
the
king
of
trouts
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
it
now
before
eddie
had
a
chance
you
shall
see
how
i
was
punished
i
crept
away
when
his
back
was
turned
taking
his
best
and
landing
net
it
may
be
remembered
i
had
lost
mine
for
it
would
be
a
deep
dip
down
into
the
sluice
the
logs
around
the
premises
were
old
and
crumbly
and
i
had
to
pick
my
way
with
care
to
reach
a
spot
from
which
it
would
be
safe
to
handle
a
big
trout
i
knew
he
was
there
i
never
had
a
stronger
conviction
in
my
life
the
projecting
ends
of
some
logs
which
i
chose
for
a
seat
seemed
fairly
permanent
and
i
made
my
preparations
with
care
i
put
on
a
new
leader
and
two
large
new
flies
then
i
rested
the
net
in
a
handy
place
took
a
look
behind
me
and
sent
the
cast
down
the
greased
lightning
current
that
was
tearing
through
the
sluice
i
expected
results
but
nothing
quite
so
sudden
neither
did
i
know
that
whales
ever
came
so
far
up
into
streams
i
know
it
was
a
whale
for
nothing
smaller
could
have
given
a
yank
like
that
besides
in
the
glimpse
i
had
of
him
he
looked
exactly
like
pictures
i
have
seen
of
the
leviathan
who
went
into
commission
for
three
days
to
furnish
passage
for
jonah
and
get
his
name
in
print
i
found
myself
suddenly
grabbing
at
things
to
hold
on
to
among
them
being
eddie
net
which
was
of
no
value
as
ballast
but
which
once
in
my
hand
i
could
not
seem
to
put
down
again
being
confused
and
toppling
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
nothing
satisfactory
to
get
hold
of
in
that
spot
i
had
not
considered
the
necessity
of
firm
anchorage
when
i
selected
the
place
but
with
a
trout
at
the
end
of
a
long
line
in
a
current
going
a
thousand
miles
a
minute
i
realized
that
it
would
be
well
to
be
lashed
to
something
permanent
as
it
was
with
my
legs
swinging
over
that
black
my
left
hand
holding
the
rod
and
my
right
clutching
the
landing
net
i
was
in
no
position
to
withstand
the
onset
of
a
battle
such
as
properly
belongs
to
the
north
pacific
ocean
where
they
have
boats
and
harpoons
and
long
coiled
lines
suitable
to
such
work
illustration
i
remember
seeing
the
sluice
black
and
swift
suddenly
rise
to
meet
me
still
i
might
have
survived
i
might
have
avoided
complete
disaster
i
think
if
the
ends
of
those
two
logs
i
selected
as
a
seat
had
been
as
sound
as
they
looked
of
course
they
were
not
they
were
never
intended
to
stand
any
such
motions
as
i
was
making
in
the
brief
moment
allowed
me
for
thought
i
realized
this
but
it
was
no
matter
my
conclusions
were
not
valuable
i
remember
seeing
the
sluice
black
and
swift
suddenly
rise
to
meet
me
and
of
dropping
eddie
net
as
i
went
down
then
i
have
a
vision
of
myself
shooting
down
that
race
in
a
wild
toboggan
ride
and
a
dim
splashy
picture
of
being
pitched
out
on
a
heap
of
brush
and
stones
and
logs
below
when
i
got
some
of
the
water
out
of
my
brains
so
i
could
think
with
them
i
realized
first
that
i
was
alive
still
clutching
my
rod
and
that
it
was
unbroken
next
that
the
whale
and
eddie
landing
net
were
gone
i
did
not
care
so
especially
much
about
the
whale
he
had
annoyed
me
i
was
willing
to
part
with
him
eddie
net
was
a
different
matter
i
never
could
go
back
without
that
after
all
his
goodness
to
me
i
had
deceived
him
slipped
away
from
him
taken
his
prized
net
and
lost
it
i
had
read
of
such
things
the
books
used
to
be
full
of
similar
incidents
and
even
if
eddie
forgave
me
as
the
good
boy
in
the
books
always
did
my
punishment
was
none
the
less
sure
my
fishing
was
ended
there
was
just
one
net
left
whatever
else
i
had
done
or
might
do
i
would
never
deprive
eddie
of
his
last
net
i
debated
whether
i
should
go
to
him
throw
myself
on
his
mercy
ask
his
forgiveness
and
offer
to
become
his
special
guide
and
servant
for
the
remainder
of
the
trip
or
commit
suicide
but
presently
i
decided
to
make
one
try
at
least
to
find
the
net
it
had
not
been
thrown
out
on
the
drift
with
me
for
it
was
not
there
being
heavy
it
had
most
likely
been
carried
along
the
bottom
and
was
at
present
lodged
in
some
deep
crevice
it
was
useless
of
course
still
i
would
try
i
was
not
much
afraid
of
the
sluice
now
that
i
had
been
introduced
to
it
i
put
my
rod
in
a
place
of
safety
and
made
my
way
to
the
upper
end
of
the
great
trough
then
i
let
myself
down
carefully
into
the
racing
water
bracing
myself
against
the
sides
and
feeling
along
the
bottom
with
my
feet
it
was
uncertain
going
for
the
heavy
current
tried
hard
to
pull
me
down
but
i
had
not
gone
three
steps
till
i
felt
something
i
could
not
believe
it
was
the
net
i
carefully
steadied
myself
and
down
down
to
my
elbow
then
i
could
have
whooped
for
joy
for
it
the
net
it
had
caught
on
an
old
nail
or
splinter
or
something
and
held
fast
eddie
was
not
at
the
camp
and
the
guides
were
busy
getting
wood
i
was
glad
for
i
was
wet
and
bruised
and
generally
disturbed
when
i
had
changed
my
things
and
recovered
a
good
deal
i
sat
in
the
shade
and
smoked
and
arranged
my
and
other
paraphernalia
and
brooded
on
the
frailty
of
human
nature
and
the
general
perversity
and
cussedness
of
things
at
large
i
had
a
confession
all
prepared
for
eddie
long
before
he
arrived
it
was
a
good
confession
sufficiently
humble
and
truthful
without
being
dangerous
i
had
tested
it
carefully
and
i
did
not
believe
it
could
result
in
any
disagreeable
penance
or
disgrace
on
my
part
it
takes
skill
to
construct
a
confession
like
that
but
it
was
wasted
when
eddie
came
in
at
last
he
wore
a
humble
look
of
his
own
and
i
did
not
see
the
immediate
need
of
confession
i
did
really
intend
to
run
off
from
you
he
began
sheepishly
i
only
wanted
to
see
what
was
above
the
dam
and
i
tried
one
or
two
of
the
places
up
there
and
they
were
all
so
bully
i
could
get
away
get
your
rod
i
want
to
take
you
up
there
before
it
gets
too
late
so
the
rascal
had
taken
advantage
of
my
brief
absence
and
slipped
off
from
me
in
his
guilty
haste
he
had
grabbed
the
first
landing
net
he
had
seen
never
suspecting
that
i
was
using
the
other
clearly
i
was
the
injured
person
i
regarded
him
with
thoughtful
reproach
while
he
begged
me
to
get
my
rod
and
come
he
would
take
nothing
he
said
but
a
net
and
would
guide
for
me
i
did
not
care
to
fish
any
more
that
day
but
i
knew
eddie
i
knew
how
his
conscience
galled
him
for
his
sin
and
would
never
give
him
peace
until
he
had
made
restitution
in
full
i
decided
to
be
generous
we
made
our
way
above
the
dam
around
an
old
pond
and
through
a
killing
thicket
of
vines
and
brush
to
a
hidden
pool
faced
with
slabs
and
bowlders
there
in
that
silent
dim
place
i
had
the
most
beautiful
hour
fishing
i
have
ever
known
the
trout
were
big
gamy
fellows
and
eddie
was
alert
obedient
and
respectful
it
was
not
until
dusk
that
he
had
paid
his
debt
to
the
last
fish
had
banished
the
final
twinge
of
remorse
our
day
however
was
not
quite
ended
we
must
return
to
camp
the
thicket
had
been
hard
to
conquer
by
daylight
now
it
was
an
impenetrable
wall
of
night
and
thorns
across
the
brook
looked
more
open
and
we
decided
to
go
over
but
when
we
got
there
it
proved
a
trackless
swampy
place
dark
and
full
of
pitfalls
and
vines
eddie
being
small
and
could
work
his
way
through
pretty
well
but
after
a
few
discouragements
i
decided
to
wade
down
the
brook
and
through
the
shallow
pond
above
the
dam
at
least
it
could
not
be
so
deadly
dark
there
it
was
business
i
went
slopping
and
plunging
among
stumps
and
stones
and
holes
i
mistook
logs
for
shadows
and
shadows
for
logs
with
pathetic
results
the
pond
that
had
seemed
small
and
shallow
by
daylight
was
big
enough
and
deep
enough
now
a
good
deal
of
the
way
i
went
on
my
hands
and
knees
but
not
from
choice
a
nearby
owl
hooted
at
me
bats
darted
back
and
forth
close
to
my
face
if
i
had
not
been
a
moral
coward
i
should
have
called
for
help
eddie
had
already
reached
camp
when
i
arrived
and
had
so
far
recovered
his
spiritual
status
that
he
jeered
at
my
condition
i
resolved
then
not
to
mention
the
sluice
and
the
landing
net
at
all
ever
i
needed
an
immediate
change
of
garments
of
course
the
third
since
morning
it
had
been
a
hard
eventful
day
such
days
make
camping
remembered
and
worth
while
footnotes
i
believe
the
best
authorities
say
that
one
change
is
enough
to
take
on
a
camping
trip
and
maybe
it
is
for
the
best
authorities
chapter
it
well
to
live
high
as
you
can
my
boy
you
happen
to
roam
it
better
to
have
enough
bacon
and
take
the
poor
wanderers
chapter
by
this
time
we
had
reached
trout
diet
i
do
know
what
means
but
i
have
often
seen
it
used
and
it
seems
to
fit
this
case
of
course
we
were
not
entirely
out
of
other
things
we
had
flour
for
flapjacks
some
cornmeal
for
mush
and
and
enough
bacon
to
impart
flavor
to
the
fish
also
we
were
not
wholly
without
beans
long
may
they
wave
the
woods
without
them
would
be
a
wilderness
indeed
but
in
the
matter
of
meat
diet
it
was
trout
as
i
have
said
unless
that
means
we
did
not
always
have
them
in
which
case
i
will
discard
those
words
we
did
we
had
fried
trout
broiled
trout
boiled
trout
baked
trout
trout
on
a
stick
and
trout
chowder
we
may
have
had
them
other
ways
i
do
remember
i
know
i
began
to
imagine
that
i
was
sprouting
fins
and
gills
and
daily
i
felt
for
the
new
bumps
on
my
head
which
i
was
certain
must
result
from
this
continuous
absorption
of
brain
food
there
were
several
new
bumps
but
when
i
called
eddie
attention
to
them
he
said
they
were
merely
the
result
of
butting
my
head
so
frequently
against
logs
and
stumps
and
other
portions
of
the
scenery
then
he
treated
them
with
liniment
and
new
skin
speaking
of
food
i
believe
i
have
not
mentioned
the
beefsteak
which
we
brought
with
us
into
the
woods
it
was
eddie
idea
and
he
was
its
guardian
and
protector
that
was
proper
only
i
think
he
protected
it
too
long
it
was
a
nice
sirloin
when
we
started
thick
and
juicy
and
of
a
deep
rich
tone
eddie
said
a
little
age
would
improve
it
and
i
suppose
he
was
right
he
most
always
is
he
said
we
would
appreciate
it
more
too
a
little
later
which
seemed
a
sound
doctrine
yet
somehow
that
steak
was
an
irritation
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
adjust
the
proper
age
of
a
steak
to
the
precise
moment
of
keen
and
general
appreciation
we
discussed
the
matter
a
good
deal
and
each
time
the
steak
was
produced
as
a
sort
of
exhibit
a
and
on
each
occasion
eddie
decided
that
the
time
was
not
ripe
that
another
day
would
add
to
its
food
value
i
may
say
that
i
had
no
special
appetite
for
steak
not
yet
but
i
did
not
want
to
see
it
carried
off
by
wild
beasts
or
offered
at
last
on
a
falling
market
besides
the
thing
was
an
annoyance
as
baggage
i
do
know
where
we
carried
it
at
first
but
i
began
to
come
upon
it
in
unexpected
places
if
i
picked
up
a
yielding
looking
package
expecting
to
find
a
dry
undergarment
or
some
other
nice
surprise
it
turned
out
to
be
that
steak
if
i
reached
down
into
one
of
the
pack
baskets
for
a
piece
of
eddie
chocolate
or
some
of
his
tobacco
for
anything
in
fact
i
would
usually
get
hold
of
a
curious
feeling
substance
and
bring
up
that
steak
i
began
to
recognize
its
texture
at
last
and
to
avoid
it
eventually
i
banished
it
from
the
baskets
altogether
then
eddie
took
to
hanging
it
on
a
limb
near
the
camp
and
if
a
shower
came
up
suddenly
he
could
rest
he
must
make
a
wild
rush
and
take
in
that
steak
i
refused
at
last
to
let
him
bring
it
into
the
tent
or
to
let
him
hang
it
on
a
nearby
limb
but
this
made
trouble
for
when
he
hung
it
farther
away
he
sometimes
forgot
it
and
twice
we
had
to
paddle
back
a
mile
or
so
to
get
that
steak
also
sometimes
it
got
wet
which
was
not
good
for
its
flavor
he
said
certainly
not
for
its
appearance
in
fact
age
told
on
that
steak
it
no
longer
had
the
deep
rich
glow
of
youth
it
had
a
discouraged
look
and
i
wondered
how
eddie
could
contemplate
it
in
that
fond
way
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
the
time
was
ripe
the
steak
was
and
that
something
ought
to
be
done
about
a
thing
like
that
my
suggestions
did
not
please
eddie
i
do
not
remember
now
just
when
we
did
at
last
cook
that
steak
i
prefer
to
forget
it
neither
do
i
know
what
eddie
did
with
his
piece
i
buried
mine
illustration
when
i
awoke
a
savory
smell
was
coming
in
the
tent
eddie
redeemed
himself
later
that
is
to
say
he
produced
something
i
could
eat
he
got
up
early
for
the
purpose
when
i
awoke
a
savory
smell
was
coming
in
the
tent
eddie
was
squatted
by
the
fire
stirring
something
in
a
frying
pan
neither
he
nor
the
guides
were
communicative
as
to
its
nature
but
it
was
good
and
i
hoped
we
would
have
it
often
then
they
told
me
what
it
was
it
was
a
preparation
with
cream
condensed
of
the
despised
canned
salmon
which
i
had
denounced
earlier
in
the
trip
as
an
insult
to
live
speckled
trout
you
see
how
one
point
of
view
may
alter
i
said
i
was
sorry
now
we
had
brought
some
dried
herring
the
others
thought
it
a
joke
but
i
was
perfectly
serious
in
fact
provisioning
for
a
camping
trip
is
a
serious
matter
where
a
canoe
must
carry
a
man
and
guide
with
traps
and
paraphernalia
and
provisions
for
a
trip
the
problem
of
condensation
in
the
matter
of
space
and
weight
with
amplitude
in
the
matter
of
quantity
affords
study
for
a
careful
mind
we
started
out
with
a
lot
of
can
and
bottle
goods
which
means
a
good
deal
of
water
and
glass
and
tin
all
of
which
are
heavy
and
take
up
room
i
do
think
ours
was
the
best
way
the
things
were
good
too
good
to
last
but
dried
fruits
apricots
prunes
and
the
like
would
have
been
nearly
as
good
and
less
burdensome
indeed
by
the
end
of
the
second
week
i
would
have
given
five
cents
apiece
for
a
few
dried
prunes
while
even
dried
apples
which
i
had
learned
to
hate
in
childhood
proved
a
gaudy
luxury
canned
beans
too
i
consider
a
mistake
you
ca
take
enough
of
them
in
that
form
no
two
canoes
can
safely
carry
enough
canned
beans
to
last
two
fishermen
and
two
nova
scotia
guides
for
three
weeks
as
for
jam
and
the
like
why
it
would
take
one
canoe
to
carry
enough
marmalade
to
supply
del
the
stout
alone
if
there
is
any
such
thing
as
a
marmalade
cure
i
hope
del
will
take
it
before
i
am
ready
to
go
into
the
woods
again
otherwise
i
shall
tow
an
extra
canoe
or
a
marmalade
factory
as
i
have
said
dried
things
are
better
fruits
beans
rice
beef
bacon
maple
sugar
for
sirup
cornmeal
and
prepared
flour
if
you
want
to
start
with
a
few
extras
in
the
way
of
canned
stuff
do
it
but
be
sure
you
have
plenty
of
the
staples
mentioned
you
will
have
enough
water
and
tin
and
glass
to
carry
with
your
condensed
milk
your
vinegar
a
few
pickles
and
such
other
bottle
refreshments
as
your
tastes
and
morals
will
permit
take
all
the
variety
you
can
in
the
way
of
dried
staples
be
sure
they
are
staples
but
cut
close
on
your
bulky
tinned
supplies
it
is
better
to
be
sure
of
enough
and
bacon
and
beans
during
the
last
week
out
than
to
feast
on
and
california
pears
the
first
chapter
it
up
and
down
the
island
reach
thicket
and
gorge
and
fen
never
a
rest
in
their
fevered
quest
the
hunter
chapter
i
would
gladly
have
lingered
at
tobeatic
dam
it
was
an
ideal
place
wholly
remote
from
everything
human
a
haunt
of
wonderful
trout
peaceable
porcupines
and
tame
birds
the
birds
used
to
come
around
the
tent
to
look
us
over
and
ask
questions
and
to
tell
us
a
lot
about
what
was
going
on
in
the
back
settlements
those
mysterious
dim
places
where
bird
and
beast
still
dwell
together
as
in
the
ancient
days
their
round
of
affairs
and
gossip
undisturbed
i
wanted
to
rest
there
and
to
heal
up
a
little
before
resuming
the
unknown
way
but
eddie
was
ruthless
there
were
more
worlds
to
conquer
the
spirit
of
some
old
ancestor
who
probably
set
out
to
discover
the
northwest
passage
was
upon
him
lower
tobeatic
lake
was
but
a
little
way
above
we
pushed
through
to
it
without
much
delay
it
was
an
extensive
piece
of
water
full
of
islands
lonely
rocks
and
calling
gulls
who
come
to
this
inland
isolation
to
rear
their
young
the
morning
was
clear
and
breezy
and
we
set
on
up
the
lake
in
the
canoes
eddie
as
usual
a
good
way
in
advance
he
called
back
to
us
now
and
then
that
this
was
great
moose
country
and
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
as
we
passed
the
islands
i
did
not
wish
to
see
moose
the
expedition
had
already
acquitted
itself
in
that
direction
but
eddie
voice
was
eager
even
authoritative
so
we
went
in
close
and
pointed
at
signs
and
whispered
in
the
usual
way
i
realized
that
eddie
had
not
given
up
the
calf
moose
idea
and
was
still
anxious
to
shine
with
those
british
museum
people
it
seemed
to
me
that
such
ambitions
were
not
laudable
i
considered
them
a
distinct
mar
to
a
character
which
was
otherwise
almost
perfect
it
was
at
such
times
that
my
inclination
to
drown
or
poison
eddie
was
stronger
than
usual
he
had
been
behind
an
island
a
good
while
when
we
thought
we
heard
a
shot
presently
we
heard
it
again
and
were
sure
del
was
instantly
all
ablaze
two
shots
had
been
the
signal
for
moose
we
went
around
there
i
suppose
we
hurried
i
know
it
was
billowy
off
the
point
and
we
shipped
water
and
nearly
swamped
as
we
rounded
behind
the
island
close
in
lay
the
other
canoe
eddie
waving
to
us
excitedly
as
we
came
up
two
calf
meese
he
called
meese
being
eddie
plural
of
moose
everybody
knows
that
mooses
is
the
word
little
helpless
fellows
not
more
than
a
day
or
two
old
they
too
young
to
swim
of
course
so
they
ca
get
on
the
island
we
got
em
sure
did
you
hit
either
of
them
i
asked
anxiously
no
of
course
not
i
only
fired
for
a
signal
they
are
wholly
at
our
mercy
they
were
right
here
just
a
moment
ago
the
mother
ran
and
they
hardly
knew
which
way
to
turn
we
can
take
them
alive
but
eddie
i
began
what
will
you
do
with
them
they
have
to
be
fed
if
we
keep
them
and
will
probably
want
to
occupy
the
tents
and
we
have
to
take
them
in
the
canoes
when
we
move
he
was
ready
for
this
objection
i
been
thinking
he
said
with
decision
dell
and
charlie
can
take
one
of
the
canoes
with
the
calves
in
it
and
make
straight
for
milford
by
the
shortest
cut
while
they
gone
we
be
exploring
the
upper
lake
this
was
a
brief
definite
plan
but
it
did
not
appeal
to
me
in
the
first
place
i
did
not
wish
to
capture
those
little
mooses
then
too
i
foresaw
that
during
the
considerable
period
which
must
elapse
before
the
guides
returned
somebody
would
have
to
cook
and
wash
dishes
and
perform
other
menial
camp
labor
i
suspected
eddie
might
get
tired
of
doing
guide
work
as
a
daily
occupation
also
i
was
sorry
for
charlie
and
del
i
had
a
mental
picture
of
them
paddling
for
dear
life
up
the
liverpool
river
with
two
calf
mooses
galloping
up
and
down
the
canoe
bleating
wildly
pausing
now
and
then
to
lap
the
faces
of
the
friendly
guides
and
perhaps
to
bite
off
an
ear
or
some
other
handy
feature
even
the
wild
animals
would
form
along
the
river
bank
to
view
a
spectacle
like
that
and
i
imagined
the
arrival
at
the
hotel
would
be
something
particularly
showy
i
mentioned
these
things
and
i
saw
that
for
once
the
guides
were
with
me
they
did
not
warm
to
the
idea
of
that
trip
up
the
liverpool
and
the
gaudy
homecoming
eddie
was
only
for
a
moment
checked
well
then
he
said
we
kill
and
skin
them
we
can
carry
the
skins
this
was
no
better
i
did
not
want
those
little
mooses
slaughtered
and
said
so
but
eddie
was
roused
now
and
withered
me
with
judicial
severity
look
here
he
said
and
his
spectacles
glared
fiercely
i
here
as
a
representative
of
the
british
museum
in
the
cause
of
science
not
to
discuss
the
protection
of
dumb
creatures
that
another
society
i
submitted
then
of
course
i
always
do
when
eddie
asserts
his
official
capacity
like
that
the
authority
of
the
british
museum
is
not
to
be
lightly
tampered
with
so
far
as
i
knew
he
could
have
me
jailed
for
contempt
we
shoved
our
canoes
in
shore
and
disembarked
eddie
turned
back
we
must
take
something
to
tie
their
hind
legs
he
said
and
fished
out
a
strap
for
that
purpose
the
hope
came
to
me
that
perhaps
after
all
he
might
not
need
the
strap
but
i
was
afraid
to
mention
it
i
confess
i
was
unhappy
i
imagined
a
pathetic
picture
of
a
little
innocent
creature
turning
its
pleading
eyes
up
to
the
captor
who
with
keen
would
let
slip
the
crimson
tide
i
had
no
wish
to
go
racing
through
the
brush
after
those
timid
victims
illustration
i
do
not
like
to
come
upon
snakes
in
that
manner
i
did
however
the
island
was
long
and
narrow
we
scattered
out
across
it
in
a
thin
line
of
battle
and
starting
at
one
end
swept
down
the
length
of
it
with
a
conquering
front
that
sounds
well
but
it
fails
to
express
what
we
did
we
did
not
sweep
and
we
did
not
have
any
front
to
speak
of
the
place
was
a
perfect
tangle
and
chaos
of
logs
bushes
vines
pits
ledges
and
fallen
trees
to
beat
up
that
covert
was
a
hot
scratchy
discouraging
job
attended
with
frequent
escapes
from
accident
and
damage
i
was
satisfied
i
had
the
worst
place
in
the
line
for
i
could
keep
up
with
the
others
and
i
tried
harder
to
do
that
than
i
did
to
find
the
little
mooses
i
did
get
sight
of
the
others
after
we
started
neither
did
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
those
little
calves
or
of
anything
else
except
a
snake
which
i
came
upon
rather
suddenly
when
i
was
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
creeping
under
a
fallen
tree
i
do
not
like
to
come
upon
snakes
in
that
manner
i
do
not
care
to
view
them
even
behind
glass
in
a
museum
an
earthquake
might
strike
that
museum
and
break
the
glass
and
it
might
not
be
easy
to
get
away
i
wish
eddie
had
been
collecting
snake
skins
for
museum
i
would
have
been
willing
for
him
to
skin
that
one
alive
i
staggered
out
to
the
other
end
of
the
island
at
last
with
only
a
flickering
remnant
of
life
left
in
me
i
thought
eddie
would
be
grateful
for
all
my
efforts
when
i
was
not
in
full
sympathy
with
the
undertaking
but
he
was
he
said
that
by
not
keeping
up
with
the
line
i
had
let
the
little
mooses
slip
by
and
that
we
would
have
to
make
the
drive
again
i
said
he
might
have
my
route
and
i
would
take
another
it
was
a
mistake
though
i
could
seem
to
pick
a
better
one
when
we
had
chased
up
and
down
that
disordered
island
that
dumping
ground
of
nature
for
the
third
time
when
i
had
fallen
over
every
log
and
stone
and
into
every
hole
on
it
and
had
scraped
myself
in
every
and
not
one
of
us
had
caught
even
an
imaginary
glimpse
of
those
little
helpless
meese
or
mooses
or
mice
for
they
were
harder
to
find
than
mice
we
staggered
out
limp
and
sore
silently
got
into
our
canoes
and
drifted
away
nobody
spoke
for
quite
a
while
nobody
had
anything
to
say
then
charlie
murmured
reflectively
as
if
thinking
aloud
little
helpless
fellows
not
more
than
a
day
or
two
old
and
del
added
also
talking
to
himself
too
young
to
swim
of
course
wholly
at
our
mercy
then
a
moment
later
it
a
good
thing
we
took
that
strap
to
tie
their
hind
legs
eddie
said
nothing
at
all
and
i
was
afraid
to
still
i
was
glad
that
my
vision
of
the
little
creatures
pleading
for
their
lives
had
been
realized
or
that
other
one
of
del
and
charlie
paddling
for
dear
life
up
the
liverpool
with
those
little
mooses
bleating
and
scampering
up
and
down
the
canoe
what
really
became
of
those
calves
remains
a
mystery
nature
teaches
her
wild
children
many
useful
things
their
first
indrawn
breath
is
laden
with
knowledge
perhaps
those
wise
little
animals
laughed
at
us
from
some
snug
hiding
perhaps
they
could
swim
after
all
and
followed
their
mother
across
the
island
and
so
away
whatever
they
did
i
am
glad
even
if
the
museum
people
have
me
arrested
for
it
chapter
the
utmost
bound
of
the
trail
is
found
last
and
loneliest
lair
hordes
of
the
forest
shall
gather
bid
you
a
welcome
chapter
i
do
not
know
what
lies
above
the
tobeatic
lakes
but
the
strip
of
country
between
is
the
true
wilderness
it
is
a
succession
of
swamps
and
spruce
thickets
ideal
country
for
a
moose
farm
or
a
mosquito
hatchery
or
for
general
exploration
but
no
sort
of
a
place
for
a
picnic
neither
is
it
a
good
place
to
fish
the
little
brook
between
the
lakes
runs
along
like
a
chain
pump
and
contains
about
as
many
trout
there
are
one
or
two
pretty
good
pools
but
the
effort
to
reach
them
is
too
costly
we
made
camp
in
as
dry
a
place
as
we
could
find
but
we
could
find
a
place
as
big
as
the
tent
that
did
have
a
spring
or
a
water
hole
in
fact
the
ground
was
a
mass
of
roots
great
and
small
with
water
everywhere
between
a
spring
actually
bubbled
up
between
our
beds
and
when
one
went
outside
at
night
it
was
a
mercy
if
he
did
not
go
plunging
into
some
sort
of
a
cold
wet
surprise
with
disastrous
and
profane
results
being
the
worst
camp
and
the
worst
country
and
the
poorest
fishing
we
had
found
we
remained
there
two
days
but
this
was
as
it
should
be
we
were
not
fishermen
now
but
explorers
and
explorers
eddie
said
always
court
hardships
and
pitch
their
camps
in
the
midst
of
dangers
immediately
after
our
arrival
eddie
and
i
took
one
side
of
the
brook
and
the
guides
the
other
and
we
set
out
to
discover
things
chiefly
the
upper
lake
of
course
we
would
pick
the
hardest
side
we
could
be
depended
on
to
do
that
the
brook
made
a
long
bend
and
the
guides
who
were
on
the
short
side
found
fairly
easy
going
eddie
and
i
almost
immediately
were
floundering
in
a
thick
miry
swamp
where
it
was
hot
and
breezeless
and
where
the
midges
mooseflies
and
mosquitoes
gave
us
a
grand
welcome
i
never
saw
anybody
so
glad
to
be
discovered
as
those
mooseflies
they
were
as
excited
as
if
we
were
long
lost
relatives
who
had
suddenly
turned
up
with
a
fortune
they
swarmed
about
us
and
clung
to
us
and
tapped
us
in
any
convenient
place
i
did
not
blame
them
of
course
moose
diet
year
in
and
year
out
would
make
them
welcome
anything
by
way
of
a
change
and
what
droves
of
moose
there
must
be
in
that
swamp
to
support
such
a
muster
of
flies
certainly
this
was
the
very
heart
of
the
moose
domain
perhaps
the
reader
who
has
never
seen
a
moosefly
may
not
appreciate
the
amplitude
and
vigor
of
our
welcome
the
moosefly
is
a
lusty
fellow
with
mottled
wings
i
believe
he
is
sometimes
called
the
deerfly
though
as
the
moose
is
bigger
and
more
savage
than
the
deer
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
moosefly
is
bigger
and
more
savage
than
any
fly
that
bites
the
deer
i
do
think
the
deer
could
survive
him
he
is
about
the
size
of
the
horsefly
but
of
more
athletic
build
he
describes
rapid
and
eager
circles
about
one
head
whizzing
meanwhile
in
a
manner
which
some
may
like
but
which
i
could
not
learn
to
enjoy
his
family
is
large
and
he
has
many
friends
he
brings
them
all
along
to
greet
you
and
they
all
whiz
and
describe
circles
at
once
and
with
every
circle
or
two
he
makes
a
dip
and
swipes
up
about
a
gill
of
your
lifeblood
and
guzzles
it
down
and
goes
right
on
whizzing
and
circling
until
he
picks
out
a
place
for
the
next
dip
unlike
the
mosquito
the
moosefly
does
not
need
to
light
cautiously
and
patiently
sink
a
well
until
he
strikes
a
paying
vein
his
practice
on
the
moose
has
fitted
him
for
speedier
methods
the
bill
with
which
he
is
accustomed
to
bore
through
a
tough
moosehide
in
a
second
or
two
will
penetrate
a
man
in
the
briefest
fraction
of
the
time
we
got
out
of
that
swamp
with
no
unnecessary
delay
and
made
for
a
spruce
thicket
ordinarily
one
does
not
welcome
a
spruce
thicket
for
it
resembles
a
tangle
of
barbed
wires
but
it
was
a
boon
now
we
scratch
all
the
places
at
once
and
the
spruce
thicket
would
help
we
plunged
into
it
and
let
it
dig
and
scrape
and
protect
us
from
those
whizzing
circling
of
the
swamp
yet
it
was
cruel
going
i
have
never
seen
such
murderous
brush
i
was
already
decorated
with
certain
areas
of
new
skin
but
i
knew
that
after
this
i
should
need
a
whole
one
having
our
rods
and
guns
made
it
harder
in
places
we
were
obliged
to
lie
perfectly
flat
to
worm
and
wriggle
through
and
the
heat
was
intense
and
our
thirst
a
torture
yet
in
the
end
it
was
worth
while
and
the
payment
was
not
long
delayed
just
beyond
the
spruce
thicket
ran
a
little
spring
rivulet
cold
as
ice
lying
on
its
ferny
margin
we
drank
and
drank
and
the
gods
themselves
can
not
create
a
more
exquisite
joy
than
that
we
followed
the
rivulet
to
where
it
fed
the
brook
a
little
way
below
there
we
found
a
pool
and
trout
also
a
cool
breeze
and
a
huge
bowlder
complete
luxury
we
rested
on
the
big
stone
i
mean
i
did
and
fished
while
eddie
was
trying
to
find
the
way
out
i
said
i
would
wait
there
until
a
relief
party
arrived
it
was
no
use
eddie
threatened
to
leave
me
at
last
if
i
did
come
on
and
i
had
no
intention
of
being
left
alone
in
that
forgotten
place
we
struggled
on
finally
near
sunset
of
that
long
hard
june
day
we
passed
out
of
the
thicket
tangle
ascended
a
slope
and
found
ourselves
in
an
open
grove
of
whispering
pines
that
through
all
the
years
had
somehow
escaped
the
conflagration
and
the
ax
tall
colonnades
they
formed
a
sort
of
grove
of
dodona
which
because
of
some
oracle
perhaps
the
gods
had
spared
and
the
conquering
vandals
had
not
swept
away
from
the
top
of
the
knoll
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
water
through
the
trees
and
presently
stood
on
the
shore
of
little
tobeatic
lake
so
it
was
we
reached
the
end
of
our
quest
the
farthest
point
in
the
unknown
i
hardly
know
what
i
had
expected
trout
of
a
new
species
and
of
gigantic
size
perhaps
or
a
strange
race
of
men
whatever
it
was
i
believe
i
felt
a
bit
disappointed
i
believe
i
did
not
consider
it
much
of
a
discovery
it
was
a
good
deal
like
other
nova
scotia
lakes
except
that
it
appeared
to
be
in
two
sections
and
pretty
big
for
its
name
but
eddie
was
rejoiced
over
our
feat
the
mooseflies
and
spruce
thickets
and
the
miry
swamps
we
had
passed
for
him
only
added
relish
to
this
moment
of
supreme
triumph
eddie
would
never
be
the
man
to
go
to
the
arctics
in
an
automobile
or
an
airship
that
would
be
too
easy
he
would
insist
on
more
embroideries
he
would
demand
all
the
combined
hardships
of
the
previous
expeditions
i
am
at
present
planning
a
trip
to
the
south
pole
but
i
shall
leave
eddie
at
home
and
perhaps
i
shall
also
be
disappointed
when
i
get
to
the
south
pole
and
find
it
only
a
rock
in
a
snowdrift
we
crossed
the
brook
and
returned
to
camp
the
short
way
we
differed
a
good
deal
as
to
the
direction
and
separated
once
or
twice
we
got
lost
at
last
for
the
way
was
so
short
and
easy
that
we
were
below
the
camp
before
we
knew
it
when
at
last
we
heard
the
guides
calling
they
had
long
since
returned
we
came
in
blaming
each
other
for
several
things
and
were
scarcely
on
speaking
terms
for
as
much
as
five
minutes
it
was
lucky
that
charles
found
a
bottle
of
jamaica
rum
and
a
little
pot
of
honey
just
then
a
mixture
of
rum
and
honey
will
allay
irritation
due
to
moosefly
and
mosquito
bites
and
to
a
variety
of
other
causes
if
faithfully
applied
the
matter
of
mosquitoes
was
really
serious
that
night
we
kept
up
several
smudge
fires
and
sat
among
them
and
smoked
ourselves
like
herring
even
then
we
were
not
immune
when
it
came
time
for
bed
we
brushed
the
inside
of
the
tent
and
set
our
pipes
going
then
eddie
wanted
to
read
as
was
his
custom
i
objected
i
said
that
to
light
a
candle
would
be
to
invite
all
those
mosquitoes
back
he
pleaded
but
for
once
i
was
firm
he
offered
me
some
of
his
best
things
but
i
refused
to
sell
my
blood
in
that
way
finally
he
declared
he
had
a
spread
of
mosquito
net
and
would
put
it
over
the
door
and
every
possible
opening
if
i
would
let
him
read
i
said
he
might
put
up
the
netting
and
if
i
approved
the
job
i
would
then
consider
the
matter
he
got
out
the
net
a
nice
new
piece
and
began
to
put
it
up
it
was
a
tedious
job
arranging
that
net
and
fastening
it
properly
by
the
flickering
firelight
so
that
it
covered
every
crack
and
crevice
when
he
pulled
it
down
in
one
place
it
left
an
opening
in
another
and
had
to
be
poked
and
pinned
and
stuffed
in
and
patted
down
a
great
many
times
from
my
place
inside
the
tent
i
could
see
his
nimble
shadow
on
the
canvas
like
some
big
insect
bobbing
and
flitting
up
and
down
and
from
side
to
side
it
reminded
me
of
a
persistent
moth
dipping
and
dodging
about
a
screen
i
drowsily
wondered
if
he
would
ever
get
it
fixed
and
if
he
was
getting
hot
and
tired
for
it
was
a
still
sticky
night
yet
i
suppose
i
did
not
realize
how
hot
and
tired
one
might
get
on
such
a
night
especially
after
a
hard
day
when
he
ceased
his
lightsome
movements
at
last
and
crept
as
carefully
as
a
worm
under
the
net
i
expected
him
to
light
the
candle
lamp
and
read
he
did
not
do
so
he
gave
one
long
sighing
groan
of
utter
exhaustion
dropped
down
on
his
bed
without
removing
his
clothes
and
never
stirred
again
until
morning
the
net
was
a
great
success
only
two
mosquitoes
got
in
and
they
bit
eddie
chapter
has
tuned
his
lute
again
the
pipes
of
pan
are
near
the
gods
that
fled
from
the
groves
of
unheeded
chapter
it
was
by
no
means
an
unpleasant
camp
first
and
last
it
was
our
farthest
north
for
one
thing
our
deepest
point
in
the
wilderness
it
would
require
as
much
as
three
or
four
days
travel
even
by
the
quickest
and
most
direct
route
to
reach
any
human
habitation
and
in
this
thought
there
was
charm
it
was
a
curious
place
too
among
those
roots
and
springs
and
the
brook
there
formed
a
rare
pool
for
bathing
while
the
others
were
still
asleep
i
slipped
down
there
for
my
morning
dip
it
was
early
but
in
that
latitude
and
season
the
sun
had
already
risen
and
filtered
in
through
the
still
treetops
lying
back
in
that
natural
basin
with
the
cool
fresh
water
slipping
over
and
about
one
and
all
the
world
afar
off
and
unreal
was
to
know
the
joy
of
the
dim
forgotten
days
when
nymphs
and
dryads
sported
in
hidden
pools
or
tripped
to
the
pipes
of
pan
hemlock
and
maple
boughs
lacing
above
with
blue
sky
between
a
hermit
thrush
singing
such
a
pool
diana
might
have
found
shut
away
in
some
remote
depths
of
arcady
i
should
not
have
been
much
surprised
to
have
heard
the
bay
of
her
hounds
in
that
still
early
morning
and
to
have
seen
her
and
her
train
suddenly
appear
pursuing
a
moose
maybe
or
merely
coming
down
for
a
morning
swim
of
course
i
should
have
secluded
myself
had
i
heard
them
coming
i
am
naturally
a
modest
person
besides
i
garner
from
the
pictures
that
diana
is
likely
to
be
dangerous
when
she
is
in
her
moods
eddie
bathed
too
later
but
the
spell
was
gone
then
diana
was
far
away
the
stillness
and
were
no
more
in
the
treetops
the
hermit
thrush
was
no
longer
in
the
neighborhood
eddie
grumbled
that
the
water
was
chilly
and
that
the
stones
hurt
his
feet
an
hour
sometimes
a
moment
even
makes
all
the
difference
between
romance
and
reality
finally
even
the
guides
bathed
we
let
off
fireworks
in
celebration
we
carried
the
canoes
to
the
lake
that
morning
and
explored
it
but
there
was
not
much
to
see
the
lake
had
no
inlet
that
we
could
find
and
eddie
and
i
lost
a
dollar
apiece
with
the
guides
betting
on
the
shape
of
it
our
idea
being
based
upon
the
glimpse
of
the
evening
before
i
care
much
for
lakes
that
change
their
shape
like
that
and
even
eddie
seemed
willing
to
abandon
this
unprofitable
region
i
suspected
however
that
his
willingness
to
take
the
back
track
was
mainly
due
to
the
hope
of
getting
another
try
at
the
little
mooses
but
i
resolved
to
indulge
myself
no
further
in
any
such
pastime
illustration
we
went
down
that
long
lovely
lake
in
a
luxury
of
idle
bliss
it
was
hard
to
drag
eddie
by
those
islands
he
wanted
to
cruise
around
every
one
of
them
and
to
go
ashore
and
prospect
among
the
débris
he
vowed
at
last
that
he
would
come
back
with
charles
from
our
next
camp
and
explore
on
his
own
account
then
there
being
a
fine
breeze
directly
behind
us
he
opened
out
a
big
umbrella
which
he
had
brought
along
for
just
such
a
time
we
hitched
our
canoe
on
behind
and
with
that
bellying
black
sail
on
the
forward
bow
went
down
that
long
lovely
lake
in
a
luxury
of
idle
bliss
we
camped
at
our
old
place
by
the
falls
and
next
morning
eddie
did
in
fact
return
to
have
another
go
at
the
calves
del
was
willing
to
stay
at
the
camp
and
i
said
i
would
have
a
quiet
day
fishing
nearby
it
proved
an
unusual
day
fishing
for
those
waters
white
perch
are
not
plentiful
there
but
for
some
reason
a
school
of
them
had
collected
just
by
our
camp
i
discovered
them
by
accident
and
then
gave
up
everything
else
to
get
as
many
of
them
as
possible
for
they
were
a
desirable
change
from
trout
and
eagerly
welcomed
i
fished
for
them
by
spells
all
day
del
and
i
had
them
for
luncheon
and
we
saved
a
great
pan
full
to
be
ready
for
supper
when
the
others
should
return
it
was
dusk
when
the
other
canoe
came
in
our
companions
were
very
tired
also
wet
for
it
had
been
a
misty
day
with
showers
eddie
was
a
bit
cross
too
they
had
seen
some
calves
he
said
but
could
not
get
them
his
guide
agreed
with
this
statement
but
when
questioned
separately
their
statements
varied
somewhat
as
to
the
reasons
of
failure
it
did
not
matter
eddie
was
discouraged
in
the
calf
moose
project
i
could
see
that
presently
i
began
boasting
of
the
big
sport
i
had
enjoyed
and
then
to
show
off
i
said
this
is
how
i
did
it
eddie
was
washing
his
hands
in
my
perch
pool
and
i
had
no
idea
of
getting
anything
one
is
not
likely
to
when
he
wishes
to
exhibit
himself
but
i
made
a
cast
with
the
light
tackle
with
two
flies
on
it
and
immediately
had
my
hands
full
for
once
i
did
actually
show
off
when
i
undertook
to
do
it
i
think
the
only
two
big
perch
in
that
pool
seized
those
flies
and
for
the
next
five
or
ten
minutes
they
were
making
my
reel
sing
and
giving
me
such
sport
as
only
two
big
white
perch
on
a
light
tackle
can
i
brought
them
to
the
net
at
last
and
eddie
looked
on
with
hungry
envious
eyes
you
do
mean
to
say
you
been
taking
those
things
all
day
he
said
all
day
more
or
less
i
merely
gave
this
little
exhibition
to
wind
up
on
but
of
course
i
had
to
show
him
the
size
of
the
others
then
and
he
was
appeased
to
the
extent
of
forgetting
most
of
his
troubles
in
a
square
meal
that
quiet
day
with
the
white
perch
ending
as
it
did
with
a
grand
finale
remains
one
of
my
fondest
memories
chapter
may
pick
your
place
you
may
choose
your
hour
may
put
on
your
choicest
flies
never
yet
was
it
safe
to
a
single
trout
would
chapter
back
across
tupper
lake
and
down
sand
brook
to
the
shelburne
eddie
left
the
further
wilderness
with
a
sigh
for
he
felt
that
his
chance
of
getting
a
moose
calf
for
those
museum
people
was
getting
slim
a
distance
i
have
forgotten
the
number
of
miles
down
the
shelburne
would
bring
us
to
country
known
to
the
guides
and
not
remote
enough
for
moose
at
this
season
as
eddie
is
no
longer
in
this
country
i
may
confess
now
that
i
was
glad
it
was
beautiful
going
down
sand
brook
there
was
plenty
of
water
and
the
day
was
perfect
there
is
nothing
lovelier
in
the
world
than
that
little
limpid
stream
with
its
pebbly
riffles
and
its
sunlit
pools
sometimes
when
i
think
of
it
now
i
am
afraid
that
it
is
no
longer
there
in
that
far
still
arcady
or
that
it
may
vanish
through
some
enchantment
before
i
can
ever
reach
it
again
indeed
as
i
am
writing
here
i
am
wondering
if
it
is
really
there
hidden
away
in
that
quiet
unvisited
place
when
no
one
is
there
to
see
it
and
to
hear
it
sing
and
whisper
if
anything
is
anywhere
unless
some
one
is
there
to
see
and
hear
but
these
are
deep
waters
i
am
prone
to
stumble
as
we
have
seen
and
somehow
my
tallest
waders
never
take
me
through
i
have
already
said
and
repeated
i
think
that
there
is
no
better
trout
fishing
than
in
the
shelburne
the
fish
now
were
not
quite
so
heavy
as
they
had
been
higher
up
but
they
were
very
many
the
last
half
of
the
miracle
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
would
not
have
been
necessary
here
had
the
multitudes
been
given
some
tackle
and
a
few
cans
of
bait
when
we
were
a
little
above
kempton
dam
del
pointed
out
the
first
place
familiar
to
him
the
woods
were
precisely
the
same
the
waters
just
as
fair
and
fruitful
the
locality
just
as
wild
but
somehow
as
we
rounded
that
bend
a
certain
breath
of
charm
vanished
the
spell
of
perfect
isolation
was
gone
i
had
the
feeling
that
we
had
emerged
from
the
enchanted
borders
of
no
man
land
that
we
were
entering
a
land
of
real
places
with
the
haunts
and
habitations
of
men
kempton
dam
itself
had
been
used
to
catch
logs
not
so
long
ago
and
eddie
had
visited
it
on
a
previous
occasion
he
still
had
a
fond
memory
of
a
very
large
trout
opinions
differed
a
trifle
as
to
its
exact
size
which
he
had
taken
there
in
a
certain
pool
of
golden
water
and
it
was
evident
from
his
talk
that
he
expected
to
take
that
trout
again
or
some
member
of
its
family
or
its
ghost
maybe
immediately
upon
arrival
it
certainly
proved
an
attractive
place
and
there
were
any
number
of
fish
they
were
not
especially
large
however
even
the
golden
water
was
fruitful
only
as
to
numbers
we
waded
among
the
rocks
or
stood
on
the
logs
and
cast
and
reeled
and
netted
and
returned
fish
to
the
water
until
we
were
fairly
surfeited
by
that
time
the
guides
had
the
camp
ready
and
as
it
was
still
early
we
gave
them
the
rods
and
watched
the
sport
now
a
tournament
at
home
is
a
tame
entertainment
when
one
has
watched
the
fishing
of
nova
scotia
guides
to
see
a
professional
send
a
fly
sailing
out
a
hundred
feet
or
so
in
madison
square
garden
is
well
enough
and
it
is
a
meritorious
achievement
no
doubt
but
there
is
no
return
except
the
record
and
the
applause
to
see
del
the
stout
and
charles
the
strong
doing
the
same
thing
from
that
old
log
dam
was
a
poem
a
picture
an
inspiration
above
and
below
the
rushing
water
overhead
the
blue
sky
on
either
side
the
green
of
june
the
treetops
full
of
the
setting
sun
out
over
the
foaming
current
skimming
just
above
the
surface
the
flies
would
go
sailing
sailing
you
thought
they
would
never
light
they
did
not
go
with
a
swish
and
a
jump
but
seemed
noiselessly
to
drift
away
as
if
the
lightly
swinging
rod
had
little
to
do
with
the
matter
as
if
they
were
alive
in
fact
looking
for
a
place
to
settle
in
some
cozy
nook
of
water
where
a
trout
would
be
sure
to
be
and
the
trout
were
there
it
was
not
the
empty
of
a
sportsman
show
the
gleam
and
splash
in
the
pool
that
seemed
remote
that
was
perhaps
thirty
yards
away
in
fact
marked
the
casting
limit
and
the
sharp
curve
of
the
rod
and
the
play
to
land
were
more
inspiring
than
any
measure
of
distance
or
clapping
of
hands
charles
himself
became
so
inspired
at
length
with
his
handsome
fishing
that
he
made
a
rash
statement
he
declared
that
he
could
take
five
trout
in
fifteen
minutes
he
offered
to
bet
a
dollar
that
he
could
do
it
i
rather
thought
he
could
myself
for
the
fish
were
there
and
they
were
not
running
over
large
still
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
land
them
in
that
swift
water
and
it
would
be
close
work
the
show
would
be
worth
a
dollar
even
if
i
lost
wherefore
i
scoffed
at
his
boast
and
took
the
bet
no
stipulations
were
made
as
to
the
size
of
the
trout
nor
the
manner
in
which
they
should
be
taken
nor
as
to
any
special
locality
it
was
evident
from
our
guide
preparation
that
he
had
evolved
certain
ideas
of
his
own
in
the
matter
previously
he
had
been
trying
to
hook
a
big
fish
but
it
was
pretty
evident
that
he
did
not
want
any
big
fish
now
there
was
a
little
brook
a
as
it
were
that
left
the
main
water
just
below
the
dam
and
came
in
again
at
the
big
pool
several
hundred
yards
below
we
had
none
of
us
touched
this
tumbling
bit
of
water
it
was
his
idea
that
it
would
be
full
of
little
trout
he
wanted
something
he
could
lift
out
with
no
unnecessary
delay
for
time
that
is
likely
to
be
worth
over
six
cents
a
minute
is
too
expensive
to
waste
in
fancy
sportsmanship
he
selected
a
short
rod
and
put
on
some
tiny
flies
then
he
took
his
position
we
got
out
our
watches
and
called
time
now
of
course
one
of
the
most
uncertain
things
in
life
to
gamble
on
is
fishing
you
may
pick
your
place
your
day
and
your
time
of
day
the
combination
may
seem
perfect
yet
the
fact
remains
that
you
can
never
count
with
certainty
on
the
result
one
might
suppose
that
our
guide
had
everything
in
his
favor
up
to
the
very
moment
of
his
wager
he
had
been
taking
trout
about
as
rapidly
as
he
could
handle
them
and
from
water
that
had
been
fished
more
or
less
all
the
afternoon
he
knew
the
particular
fly
that
had
been
most
attractive
on
this
particular
day
and
he
had
selected
a
place
hitherto
unfished
just
the
sort
of
a
place
where
small
trout
seemed
likely
to
abound
with
his
skill
as
an
angler
it
would
not
have
surprised
me
if
he
had
taken
his
five
trout
and
had
more
than
half
the
time
to
spare
i
think
he
expected
to
do
that
himself
i
think
he
did
for
he
went
at
it
with
that
smiling
with
which
one
does
a
sleight
of
hand
trick
after
long
practice
he
did
not
show
any
appearance
of
haste
in
making
his
first
cast
but
let
the
flies
go
gently
out
over
a
little
eddying
pool
and
lightly
skim
the
surface
of
the
water
as
if
he
were
merely
amusing
himself
by
tantalizing
those
eager
little
trout
yet
for
some
reason
nothing
happened
perhaps
the
little
trout
were
attending
a
party
in
the
next
pool
there
came
no
lively
snap
at
those
twitching
flies
there
was
not
even
a
silver
break
on
the
surface
of
the
water
i
thought
our
guide
smile
faded
the
least
trifle
and
that
he
let
the
flies
go
a
bit
quicker
next
time
then
when
nothing
absolutely
nothing
happened
again
his
look
became
one
of
injured
surprise
he
abandoned
that
pool
and
stepping
a
rock
or
two
downstream
sent
the
flies
with
a
sharp
little
flirt
into
the
next
once
twice
it
was
strange
it
was
unaccountable
but
nothing
not
a
single
thing
happened
again
it
was
the
same
with
the
next
pool
and
the
next
there
were
no
special
marks
of
or
anything
that
even
resembled
deliberation
after
this
it
was
business
strictly
business
with
the
sole
idea
of
taking
five
fish
out
of
that
run
or
getting
down
to
a
place
where
five
fish
could
be
had
it
was
a
pretty
desperate
situation
for
it
was
a
steep
run
and
there
was
no
going
back
to
attempt
that
would
be
to
waste
too
much
precious
time
the
thing
to
do
was
to
fish
it
straight
through
with
no
unnecessary
delay
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
this
was
our
guide
programme
the
way
he
deported
himself
showed
that
perhaps
he
was
not
really
in
a
hurry
i
want
to
be
just
but
he
acted
as
if
he
was
i
have
never
seen
a
but
if
i
ever
meet
one
i
shall
recognize
him
for
i
am
certain
he
will
look
exactly
like
charles
the
strong
going
down
tommy
kempton
run
he
was
shod
in
his
shoepacks
and
he
seemed
to
me
to
have
one
foot
always
in
the
air
wildly
reaching
out
for
the
next
rock
the
pair
of
flies
meanwhile
describing
lightning
circles
over
every
pool
and
riffle
lingering
just
long
enough
to
prove
the
futility
of
the
cast
to
be
lying
an
instant
later
in
a
new
spot
several
yards
below
if
ever
there
is
a
tournament
for
swift
and
accurate
down
a
flight
of
rugged
stone
stairs
i
want
to
enter
charles
for
first
honors
against
the
world
but
i
would
not
bet
on
any
fish
i
want
that
stipulated
i
would
not
gamble
to
that
extent
i
would
not
gamble
even
on
one
fish
after
being
a
witness
to
our
guide
experience
that
was
a
mad
race
the
rest
of
us
kept
a
little
to
one
side
out
of
his
way
and
not
even
del
and
eddie
could
keep
up
with
him
and
with
all
that
wild
effort
not
a
fish
would
rise
nor
even
break
water
it
was
strange
it
was
past
believing
i
suppose
it
was
even
funny
it
must
have
been
for
i
seem
to
recall
that
we
fairly
whooped
our
joy
at
his
acrobatic
eagerness
why
with
such
gymnastics
charles
did
not
break
his
neck
i
can
not
imagine
with
the
utmost
watchfulness
i
barely
missed
breaking
mine
as
much
as
a
dozen
times
the
time
was
more
than
when
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
run
and
still
no
fish
not
even
a
rise
yet
the
game
was
not
over
it
was
supposable
that
this
might
be
the
place
of
places
for
fish
five
fish
in
five
minutes
were
still
possible
if
small
the
guide
leaped
and
waded
to
a
smooth
commanding
stone
and
cast
once
twice
out
over
the
twisting
water
then
suddenly
almost
in
front
of
him
it
seemed
a
great
wave
rolled
up
from
the
depths
there
was
a
swish
and
a
quick
curving
of
the
rod
a
monstrous
commotion
and
a
struggle
in
the
water
it
was
a
king
of
fish
we
could
all
see
that
and
the
rest
of
us
gave
a
shout
of
approval
but
if
charles
was
happy
he
did
not
look
it
in
fact
i
have
never
seen
any
one
act
so
unappreciative
of
a
big
fish
nor
handle
it
in
so
unsportsmanlike
a
manner
if
i
remember
his
remark
it
had
damn
and
hell
mixed
up
in
it
and
these
words
were
used
in
close
association
with
that
beautiful
trout
his
actions
were
even
worse
he
made
no
effort
to
play
his
catch
to
work
him
gradually
to
the
net
according
to
the
best
form
nothing
of
the
kind
you
have
supposed
our
guide
had
never
seen
a
big
trout
before
by
the
way
he
got
hold
of
that
line
and
yanked
him
in
hand
over
hand
regardless
of
the
danger
to
line
and
leader
and
to
those
delicate
little
flies
to
say
nothing
of
the
possibility
of
losing
a
fish
so
handled
of
course
the
seconds
were
flying
and
landing
a
fish
of
that
size
is
not
an
especially
quick
process
a
trout
in
swift
water
has
a
way
of
staying
there
even
when
taken
by
the
main
strength
and
awkwardness
system
when
only
about
a
yard
of
line
remained
between
charlie
and
the
fish
the
latter
set
up
such
a
commotion
and
cut
up
such
a
series
of
antics
that
it
was
impossible
for
one
man
to
hold
him
and
net
him
though
the
wild
effort
which
our
guide
made
to
do
so
seemed
amusing
to
those
who
were
looking
on
in
fact
if
i
had
not
been
weak
with
laughing
i
might
have
gone
to
his
rescue
sooner
one
may
be
generous
to
a
defeated
opponent
and
the
time
limit
was
on
its
last
minute
now
as
it
was
i
waded
over
presently
and
took
the
net
a
moment
later
we
had
him
the
single
return
in
the
allotted
time
but
by
all
odds
the
largest
trout
thus
far
of
the
expedition
you
see
as
i
have
said
fish
are
uncertain
things
to
gamble
on
trying
for
five
small
ones
our
fisherman
captured
one
large
fish
which
at
any
other
moment
of
the
expedition
would
have
been
more
welcome
yet
even
he
was
an
uncertain
quantity
for
big
strong
and
active
as
he
was
he
suddenly
gave
a
great
leap
out
of
the
net
and
was
back
in
the
water
again
still
i
let
him
be
counted
that
was
generous
you
might
have
supposed
after
that
demonstration
eddie
would
have
been
somewhat
reticent
about
backing
his
skill
as
a
fisherman
but
he
was
he
had
just
as
much
faith
in
his
angling
and
in
his
ability
to
pick
good
water
as
if
he
had
seen
his
guide
go
down
to
ignominy
and
defeat
he
knew
a
place
just
above
the
dam
he
said
where
he
could
make
that
bet
good
would
i
give
him
the
same
terms
i
would
the
offer
was
open
to
all
comers
i
said
it
was
taking
candy
from
children
illustration
it
was
worth
the
dollar
to
watch
the
way
he
sought
to
wheedle
and
coax
and
fascinate
those
trout
we
went
up
to
eddie
place
and
got
out
the
watches
eddie
had
learned
something
from
his
guide
exhibition
he
had
learned
not
to
prance
about
over
a
lot
of
water
and
not
to
seem
to
be
in
a
hurry
it
was
such
things
that
invited
mirth
he
took
his
position
carefully
between
two
great
bowlders
and
during
the
next
fifteen
minutes
gave
us
the
most
charming
exhibition
of
light
and
delicate
i
have
ever
witnessed
it
was
worth
the
dollar
to
watch
the
way
in
which
he
sought
to
wheedle
and
coax
and
fascinate
those
trout
and
to
study
the
deft
dispatch
and
grace
with
which
he
landed
a
fish
once
hooked
still
he
had
learned
quite
enough
he
had
learned
to
take
five
trout
in
fifteen
minutes
in
that
particular
place
and
on
that
particular
evening
perhaps
it
was
a
little
late
when
he
began
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
is
a
shorter
period
than
it
sometimes
seems
three
trout
completed
his
score
at
the
end
of
the
allotted
time
all
fairly
large
yet
i
must
not
fail
to
add
here
that
a
few
days
later
in
other
water
both
eddie
and
his
guide
made
good
their
wager
each
took
his
five
trout
small
ones
in
fifteen
minutes
and
had
time
to
spare
as
i
have
remarked
once
or
twice
already
one
of
the
most
uncertain
things
in
life
to
gamble
on
is
fishing
chapter
the
waves
they
pitch
and
the
waves
they
toss
the
waves
they
frighten
me
if
ever
i
get
my
boat
go
no
more
to
chapter
we
were
met
by
a
surprise
at
our
camp
two
men
sat
there
real
men
the
first
we
had
seen
since
we
entered
the
wilderness
evidently
they
were
natives
by
their
look
trappers
or
prospectors
of
some
sort
they
turned
out
to
be
bear
hunters
and
they
looked
rather
hungrily
at
the
assortment
of
fish
we
had
brought
in
enough
for
supper
and
breakfast
perhaps
they
had
not
been
to
fish
so
frequently
as
to
bear
i
believe
they
were
without
tackle
or
maybe
their
luck
had
been
poor
i
do
not
remember
at
all
events
it
developed
presently
that
they
needed
fish
also
that
they
had
a
surplus
of
butter
of
a
more
recent
period
than
the
little
dab
we
had
left
they
were
willing
to
dicker
a
circumstance
that
filled
us
with
an
enthusiasm
which
we
restrained
with
difficulty
in
fact
del
did
not
restrain
his
quite
enough
he
promptly
offered
them
all
the
fish
we
had
brought
in
for
their
extra
pound
of
butter
when
we
could
just
as
easily
have
got
it
for
half
the
number
of
fish
of
course
the
fish
did
not
seem
especially
valuable
to
us
and
we
were
willing
enough
to
make
a
meal
without
them
still
one
can
never
tell
what
will
happen
and
something
like
six
dollars
worth
of
trout
reckoned
by
new
york
prices
seems
an
unnecessary
sum
to
pay
for
a
pound
of
butter
even
in
the
nova
scotia
woods
though
possibly
trout
will
never
be
worth
quite
that
much
there
all
the
same
the
price
had
advanced
a
good
deal
by
next
morning
for
the
wind
had
shifted
to
the
northeast
and
it
was
bleak
and
blustery
everybody
knows
the
old
rhyme
about
the
winds
and
the
fish
how
when
the
winds
are
north
or
east
the
fish
bite
least
and
how
when
the
winds
are
south
and
west
the
fish
bite
best
there
is
much
poetry
in
the
old
rhyme
but
it
charged
with
sterling
truth
just
why
a
northerly
or
easterly
wind
will
take
away
a
fish
appetite
i
think
has
never
been
explained
or
why
a
southerly
and
westerly
wind
will
start
him
out
hunting
for
food
but
it
all
as
true
as
scripture
i
have
seen
trout
stop
rising
with
a
shifting
of
the
wind
to
the
eastward
as
suddenly
as
if
they
had
been
summoned
to
judgment
and
i
have
seen
them
begin
after
a
cold
spell
almost
before
the
wind
had
time
to
get
settled
in
its
new
quarter
of
course
it
had
been
del
idea
that
we
could
easily
get
trout
enough
for
breakfast
that
was
another
mistake
we
could
we
could
take
them
from
the
river
and
we
could
take
them
from
our
bear
hunters
for
they
had
gone
we
whipped
our
lines
around
in
that
chill
wind
tangled
our
flies
in
treetops
endangered
our
immortal
souls
and
went
back
to
the
tents
at
last
without
a
single
thing
but
our
appetites
then
we
took
turns
abusing
del
for
his
disastrous
dicker
by
which
he
had
paid
no
less
than
five
dollars
and
cents
a
pound
too
much
for
butter
new
york
market
schedule
our
appetites
were
not
especially
for
trout
only
for
hearty
food
of
some
kind
and
as
i
have
said
before
we
had
reached
a
place
where
fish
had
become
our
real
staple
the
conditions
were
particularly
hard
on
del
himself
for
he
is
a
hearty
man
and
next
to
jars
of
marmalade
baskets
of
trout
are
his
favorite
forage
in
fact
we
rather
lost
interest
in
our
camp
and
disagreeable
as
it
was
we
decided
to
drop
down
the
river
to
lake
rossignol
and
cross
over
to
the
mouth
of
the
liverpool
it
was
a
long
ferriage
across
rossignol
and
we
could
devote
our
waste
time
to
getting
over
by
the
end
of
the
trip
the
weather
might
change
the
shelburne
is
rough
below
kempton
dam
it
goes
tearing
and
foaming
in
and
out
among
the
black
rocks
and
there
are
places
where
you
have
to
get
out
of
the
canoes
and
climb
over
and
the
rocks
are
slippery
and
sometimes
there
is
not
much
to
catch
hold
of
we
shot
out
into
the
lake
at
last
and
i
was
glad
it
was
a
mistake
however
to
be
glad
just
then
it
was
too
soon
the
wind
had
kicked
up
a
good
deal
of
water
and
though
our
canoes
were
lighter
than
when
we
started
i
did
not
consider
them
suited
to
such
a
sea
they
pitched
about
and
leaped
up
into
the
air
one
minute
with
the
bow
entirely
out
of
water
and
the
next
with
it
in
the
billow
ahead
every
other
second
a
big
wave
ran
on
a
level
with
the
gunwale
and
crested
its
neck
and
looked
over
and
hissed
and
sometimes
it
spilled
in
upon
us
it
would
not
take
much
of
that
kind
of
freight
to
make
a
cargo
and
anything
like
an
accident
in
that
wide
gray
billowy
place
was
not
a
nice
thing
to
contemplate
a
loaded
canoe
would
go
down
like
a
bullet
no
one
clad
as
we
were
could
swim
more
than
a
boat
length
in
that
sea
as
we
got
farther
on
shore
the
waves
got
worse
if
somebody
had
just
suggested
it
i
should
have
been
willing
to
turn
around
and
make
back
for
the
shelburne
nobody
suggested
it
and
we
went
on
it
seemed
to
me
those
far
dim
shores
through
the
mist
five
miles
or
more
away
would
never
get
any
closer
i
grew
tired
too
and
my
arms
ached
but
i
could
not
stop
paddling
i
was
filled
with
the
idea
that
if
i
ever
stopped
that
eternal
dabbing
at
the
water
my
end
of
the
canoe
would
never
ride
the
next
billow
del
reflected
aloud
now
and
then
that
we
had
made
a
mistake
to
come
out
on
such
a
day
when
i
looked
over
at
the
other
canoe
and
saw
it
on
the
top
of
a
big
wave
with
both
ends
sticking
out
in
the
air
and
then
saw
it
go
down
in
a
trough
of
black
ugly
water
i
realized
that
del
was
right
i
knew
our
canoe
was
doing
just
such
dangerous
things
as
that
and
i
would
have
given
any
reasonable
sum
for
an
adequate
life
preserver
or
even
a
handy
pine
plank
for
anything
in
fact
that
was
rather
more
certain
to
stay
on
top
of
the
water
than
this
peanut
shell
of
a
canoe
i
suppose
i
became
unduly
happy
therefore
when
at
last
we
entered
the
mouth
of
the
liverpool
i
was
so
glad
that
i
grew
gay
and
when
we
started
up
the
rapids
i
gave
del
a
good
lift
here
and
there
by
pushing
back
against
the
rocks
with
my
paddle
throwing
my
whole
weight
on
it
sometimes
to
send
the
canoe
up
in
style
it
is
always
unwise
for
me
to
have
a
gay
reaction
like
that
especially
on
friday
which
is
my
unlucky
day
something
is
so
liable
to
happen
we
were
going
up
a
particularly
steep
piece
of
water
when
i
got
my
paddle
against
a
stone
on
the
bottom
and
gave
an
exceptionally
strong
push
i
do
know
just
what
happened
next
perhaps
my
paddle
slipped
del
says
it
did
i
know
i
heard
him
give
a
whoop
and
i
saw
the
river
coming
straight
up
at
me
then
it
came
pouring
in
over
the
side
and
in
about
a
minute
more
most
of
our
things
were
floating
downstream
with
del
grabbing
at
them
and
me
clinging
to
the
upset
canoe
trying
to
drag
it
ashore
we
camped
there
it
was
a
good
place
one
of
the
best
yet
selected
still
i
do
not
recommend
selecting
a
camp
in
that
way
if
it
did
not
turn
out
well
it
might
be
a
poor
place
to
get
things
dry
one
needs
to
get
a
good
many
things
dry
after
a
selection
like
that
especially
on
a
cold
day
it
was
a
cold
night
too
i
dried
my
under
things
and
put
them
all
on
did
you
ever
sleep
in
your
clothes
in
the
woods
i
have
been
asked
i
did
i
put
on
every
dry
thing
i
had
that
night
and
regretted
i
had
left
anything
at
home
chapter
is
better
to
let
the
wild
beast
run
to
let
the
wild
bird
fly
harbors
best
in
his
native
nest
as
you
and
chapter
perhaps
it
was
the
cold
weather
that
brought
us
a
visitor
there
was
a
tree
directly
over
our
tent
and
in
the
morning
a
sharp
sunny
morning
with
the
wind
where
it
should
be
in
the
west
we
noticed
on
going
out
that
a
peculiar
sort
of
fruit
had
grown
on
this
tree
over
night
on
one
of
the
limbs
just
above
the
tent
was
a
prickly
looking
ball
like
a
chestnut
burr
only
black
and
about
a
hundred
times
as
big
it
was
a
baby
porcupine
who
perhaps
had
set
out
to
see
the
world
on
his
own
account
a
sort
of
prodigal
who
had
found
himself
without
funds
and
helpless
on
a
cold
night
no
doubt
he
climbed
up
there
to
look
us
over
with
a
view
of
picking
out
a
good
place
for
himself
possibly
with
the
hope
of
being
invited
to
breakfast
eddie
was
delighted
with
our
new
guest
he
declared
that
he
would
take
him
home
alive
and
feed
him
and
care
for
him
and
live
happy
ever
after
he
got
a
pole
and
shook
our
visitor
down
in
a
basket
and
did
a
of
joy
over
his
new
possession
he
was
a
cute
little
fellow
the
piggypine
another
of
eddie
absurd
names
with
bright
little
eyes
and
certain
areas
of
fur
but
i
did
fancy
him
as
a
pet
he
seemed
to
me
rather
too
much
of
a
cross
between
a
rat
and
a
pin
cushion
to
be
a
pleasant
companion
in
the
intimate
relations
of
household
i
suspected
that
if
in
a
perfectly
wild
state
he
had
been
prompted
to
seek
human
companionship
and
the
comforts
of
civilized
life
in
a
domestic
atmosphere
he
would
want
to
sit
at
the
table
and
sleep
with
somebody
i
did
not
believe
eddie
affection
would
survive
these
familiarities
i
knew
how
surprised
and
annoyed
he
might
be
some
night
to
roll
over
suddenly
on
the
piggypine
and
then
have
to
sit
up
the
rest
of
the
night
while
a
surgeon
removed
the
quills
i
said
that
i
did
not
believe
in
taming
wild
creatures
and
i
think
the
guides
were
with
me
in
this
opinion
i
think
so
because
they
recited
two
instances
while
we
were
at
breakfast
del
story
was
of
some
pet
gulls
he
once
owned
he
told
it
in
that
serious
way
which
convinced
me
of
its
truth
certain
phases
of
the
narrative
may
have
impressed
me
as
being
humorous
but
it
was
clear
they
were
not
so
regarded
by
del
his
manner
was
that
of
one
who
records
history
he
said
one
of
the
children
caught
two
young
gulls
once
in
the
lake
and
brought
them
to
the
house
and
said
they
were
going
to
tame
them
i
did
think
they
would
live
but
they
did
you
could
have
killed
them
without
an
ax
they
got
tame
right
away
and
they
were
all
over
the
house
under
foot
and
into
everything
making
all
kinds
of
trouble
but
that
was
the
worst
the
worst
was
feeding
them
it
was
so
bad
when
they
were
little
but
they
grew
to
beat
anything
then
it
began
to
keep
us
moving
to
get
enough
for
them
to
eat
they
lived
on
fish
mostly
and
at
first
the
children
thought
it
fun
to
feed
them
they
used
to
bait
a
little
dip
net
and
catch
minnows
for
the
gulls
and
the
gulls
got
so
they
would
follow
anybody
that
started
out
with
that
dip
net
calling
and
squealing
like
a
pair
of
pigs
but
they
were
worse
than
pigs
you
can
fill
up
a
pig
and
he
will
go
to
sleep
but
you
never
could
fill
up
those
gulls
by
and
by
the
children
got
tired
of
trying
to
do
it
and
gave
me
the
job
i
made
a
big
dip
net
and
kept
it
set
day
and
night
and
every
few
minutes
all
day
and
the
last
thing
before
bedtime
i
go
down
and
lift
out
about
a
pailful
of
fish
for
those
gulls
and
eat
until
the
fish
tails
stuck
out
of
their
mouths
and
i
would
more
than
have
my
back
turned
before
they
be
standing
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
looking
down
into
that
dip
net
and
hollering
for
more
i
got
so
i
could
do
anything
but
catch
fish
for
those
gulls
it
was
a
busy
season
too
and
besides
the
minnows
were
getting
scarce
along
the
lake
front
so
i
had
to
get
up
early
to
get
enough
to
feed
them
and
the
rest
of
the
family
i
said
at
last
that
i
was
through
feeding
gulls
i
told
the
children
that
either
they
have
to
do
it
or
that
the
gulls
would
have
to
go
to
work
like
the
rest
of
the
family
and
fish
for
themselves
but
the
children
would
do
it
nor
the
gulls
either
then
i
said
i
would
take
those
birds
down
in
the
woods
and
leave
them
somewhere
i
did
that
i
put
them
into
a
basket
and
shut
them
in
tight
and
took
them
five
miles
down
the
river
and
let
them
loose
in
a
good
place
where
there
were
plenty
of
fish
they
flew
off
and
i
went
home
when
i
got
to
the
house
they
been
there
three
hours
looking
at
the
dip
net
and
squalling
and
they
ate
a
pail
heaping
full
of
fish
and
you
could
have
put
both
gulls
into
the
pail
when
they
got
through
i
was
going
on
a
long
trip
with
a
party
next
morning
and
we
took
the
gulls
along
we
fed
them
about
a
bushel
of
trout
and
left
them
seventeen
miles
down
the
river
just
before
night
and
drove
home
in
the
dark
i
did
think
the
gulls
would
find
their
way
back
that
time
but
they
did
they
were
there
before
daybreak
fresh
and
hungry
as
ever
then
i
knew
it
was
no
use
the
ax
was
the
only
thing
that
would
get
me
out
of
that
mess
the
children
have
brought
home
any
wild
pets
since
that
you
see
is
just
unembellished
history
and
convincing
i
regret
that
i
can
not
say
as
much
for
charlie
narrative
it
is
a
likely
story
enough
as
such
things
go
but
there
are
points
about
it
here
and
there
which
seem
to
require
confirmation
i
am
told
that
it
is
a
story
well
known
and
often
repeated
in
nova
scotia
but
even
that
can
not
be
accepted
as
evidence
of
its
entire
truth
being
a
it
would
seem
to
require
something
more
this
is
the
tale
as
charlie
told
it
once
there
was
a
indian
he
said
who
had
a
pet
trout
named
tommy
which
he
kept
in
a
barrel
but
the
trout
got
pretty
big
and
had
to
have
the
water
changed
a
good
deal
to
keep
him
alive
the
indian
was
too
lazy
to
do
that
and
he
thought
he
would
teach
the
trout
to
live
out
of
water
so
he
did
he
commenced
by
taking
tommy
out
of
the
barrel
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
pretty
often
and
then
he
took
him
out
oftener
and
kept
him
out
longer
and
by
and
by
tommy
got
so
he
could
stay
out
a
good
while
if
he
was
in
the
wet
grass
then
the
indian
found
he
could
leave
him
in
the
wet
grass
all
night
and
pretty
soon
that
trout
could
live
in
the
shade
whether
the
grass
was
wet
or
not
by
that
time
he
had
got
pretty
tame
too
and
he
used
to
follow
the
indian
around
a
good
deal
and
when
the
indian
would
go
out
to
dig
worms
for
him
tommy
would
go
along
and
pick
up
the
worms
for
himself
the
indian
thought
everything
of
that
fish
and
when
tommy
got
so
he
did
need
water
at
all
but
could
go
anywhere
down
the
dusty
road
and
stay
all
day
out
in
the
hot
sun
you
never
saw
the
indian
without
his
trout
show
people
wanted
to
buy
tommy
but
the
indian
said
he
would
sell
a
fish
like
that
for
any
money
you
see
him
coming
to
town
with
tommy
following
along
in
the
road
behind
just
like
a
dog
only
of
course
it
traveled
a
good
deal
like
a
snake
and
most
as
fast
well
it
was
pretty
sad
the
way
that
indian
lost
his
trout
and
it
was
curious
too
he
started
for
town
one
day
with
tommy
coming
along
behind
as
usual
there
was
a
bridge
in
the
road
and
when
the
indian
came
to
it
he
saw
there
was
a
plank
off
but
he
went
on
over
it
without
thinking
by
and
by
he
looked
around
for
tommy
and
tommy
was
there
he
went
back
a
ways
and
called
but
he
could
see
anything
of
his
pet
then
he
came
to
the
bridge
and
saw
the
hole
and
he
thought
right
away
that
maybe
his
trout
had
got
in
there
so
he
went
to
the
hole
and
looked
down
and
sure
enough
there
was
tommy
floating
on
the
water
up
he
tumbled
through
that
hole
into
the
brook
and
drowned
i
think
these
stories
impressed
eddie
a
good
deal
i
know
they
did
me
even
if
charlie
story
was
not
pure
fact
in
certain
minor
details
its
moral
was
none
the
less
evident
i
saw
clearer
than
ever
that
it
is
not
proper
to
take
wild
creatures
from
their
native
element
and
make
pets
of
them
something
always
happens
to
them
sooner
or
later
we
were
through
breakfast
and
eddie
went
over
to
look
at
his
porcupine
he
had
left
it
in
a
basket
well
covered
with
a
number
of
things
he
came
back
right
away
looking
a
little
blank
i
thought
he
gone
he
said
the
basket
just
as
i
left
it
all
covered
up
but
he
is
in
it
we
went
over
to
look
sure
enough
our
visitor
had
set
out
on
new
adventures
how
he
had
escaped
was
a
mystery
it
did
matter
both
he
and
eddie
were
better
off
but
that
was
a
day
for
animal
friends
where
we
camped
for
luncheon
eddie
and
i
took
a
walk
along
the
river
bank
and
suddenly
found
ourselves
in
a
perfect
menagerie
we
were
among
a
regular
group
of
grown
porcupines
we
counted
five
of
them
and
at
the
same
time
there
were
two
blue
herons
in
the
water
close
by
a
step
away
a
pair
of
partridges
ran
through
the
brush
and
stood
looking
at
us
from
a
fallen
log
while
an
old
duck
and
her
young
came
sailing
across
the
river
we
were
nearing
civilization
now
but
evidently
these
creatures
were
not
much
harassed
it
was
like
the
garden
of
eden
before
the
fall
it
is
true
the
old
duck
swam
away
calling
to
her
brood
when
she
saw
us
the
partridges
presently
hid
in
the
brush
and
the
blue
herons
waded
a
bit
further
off
but
the
porcupines
went
on
galumphing
around
us
and
none
of
the
collection
seemed
much
disturbed
during
the
afternoon
we
came
upon
two
fishermen
college
boys
camping
who
told
us
they
had
seen
some
young
loons
in
a
nest
just
above
and
eddie
was
promptly
seized
with
a
desire
to
possess
them
in
fact
we
left
so
hastily
that
del
forgot
his
extra
paddle
and
did
not
discover
the
loss
until
we
were
a
or
so
upstream
then
he
said
he
would
leave
me
in
the
canoe
to
fish
and
would
walk
back
along
the
shore
an
arm
of
the
river
made
around
an
island
just
there
and
it
looked
like
a
good
place
there
seemed
to
be
not
much
current
in
the
water
and
i
thought
i
could
manage
the
canoe
in
such
a
spot
and
fish
too
without
much
trouble
illustration
i
never
realized
before
what
a
crazy
thing
a
canoe
can
be
when
you
want
it
to
do
something
out
of
its
regular
line
of
work
it
was
not
as
easy
as
it
looked
any
one
who
has
tried
to
handle
a
canoe
from
the
front
end
with
one
hand
and
fish
with
the
other
will
tell
you
so
i
could
seem
to
keep
out
of
the
brush
along
the
shore
and
i
could
get
near
some
brush
in
the
middle
of
the
river
where
i
believed
there
were
trout
i
was
right
about
the
trout
being
there
too
eddie
proved
that
when
he
came
up
with
his
canoe
he
had
plenty
of
business
with
big
fellows
right
away
but
the
fact
did
do
me
any
good
just
when
i
would
get
near
the
lucky
place
and
ready
to
cast
a
twitch
in
the
current
or
a
little
puff
of
wind
would
get
hold
of
the
stern
of
my
craft
which
rode
up
out
of
the
water
high
and
light
like
a
sail
and
my
flies
would
land
in
some
bushes
along
the
bank
or
hang
in
a
treetop
or
do
some
other
silly
thing
which
was
entertaining
enough
to
eddie
and
his
guide
apparently
but
which
did
not
amuse
me
i
never
realized
before
what
a
crazy
thing
a
canoe
can
be
when
you
want
it
to
do
something
out
of
its
regular
line
of
work
a
canoe
is
a
good
sort
of
a
craft
in
its
place
and
i
would
not
wish
to
go
into
the
woods
without
one
but
it
is
limited
in
its
gifts
very
limited
it
ca
keep
its
balance
with
any
degree
of
certainty
when
you
want
to
stand
up
and
fish
and
it
has
no
sort
of
notion
of
staying
in
one
place
unless
it
hauled
out
on
the
bank
if
that
canoe
had
been
given
the
versatility
of
an
ordinary
i
could
have
got
along
better
than
i
did
i
said
as
much
and
disparaged
canoes
generally
eddie
declared
that
he
had
never
heard
me
swear
with
such
talent
and
unreserve
he
encouraged
me
by
holding
up
each
fish
as
he
caught
it
and
by
suggesting
that
i
come
over
there
he
knew
very
well
that
i
could
get
there
in
a
thousand
years
whenever
i
tried
to
do
it
that
fool
of
a
canoe
shot
out
at
a
tangent
and
brought
up
nowhere
finally
in
an
effort
to
reconstruct
my
rod
i
dropped
a
joint
of
the
noibwood
overboard
and
it
went
down
in
about
four
hundred
feet
of
water
then
i
believe
i
did
have
a
few
things
to
say
i
was
surprised
at
my
own
proficiency
it
takes
a
crucial
moment
like
that
to
develop
real
genius
i
polished
off
the
situation
and
i
trimmed
up
the
corners
possibly
a
touch
of
sun
made
me
fluent
for
it
was
hot
out
there
though
it
was
not
as
hot
as
a
place
i
told
them
about
and
i
dwelt
upon
its
fitness
as
a
permanent
abiding
place
for
fishermen
in
general
and
for
themselves
in
particular
when
i
was
through
and
empty
i
over
to
the
bank
and
waited
for
del
i
believe
i
had
a
feverish
hope
that
they
would
conclude
to
take
my
advice
and
that
i
should
never
see
their
canoe
and
its
contents
again
there
are
always
compensations
for
those
who
suffer
and
are
meek
in
spirit
that
was
the
evening
i
caught
the
big
fish
the
fish
that
eddie
would
have
given
a
corner
of
his
immortal
soul
if
he
has
a
soul
and
if
it
has
corners
to
have
taken
it
was
just
below
a
big
fall
loon
lake
falls
i
think
they
call
it
and
we
were
going
to
camp
there
eddie
had
taken
one
side
of
the
pool
and
i
the
other
and
neither
of
us
had
caught
anything
eddie
was
just
landing
when
something
that
looked
big
and
important
far
down
the
swift
racing
current
rose
to
what
i
had
intended
as
my
last
cast
i
had
the
little
bamboo
but
i
let
the
flies
go
down
there
the
fly
i
mean
for
i
was
casting
with
one
a
big
silver
doctor
and
the
king
was
there
waiting
he
took
it
with
a
great
slop
and
carried
out
a
long
stretch
of
line
it
was
a
test
for
the
little
rod
there
had
been
unkind
remarks
about
the
tiny
bamboo
whip
this
was
to
be
justification
a
big
trout
on
a
long
line
in
deep
swift
water
the
combination
was
perfect
battle
now
ye
ruler
of
the
rapids
show
your
timber
now
thou
slender
wisp
of
silk
and
cane
but
we
have
had
enough
of
fishing
i
shall
not
dwell
upon
the
details
of
that
contest
i
may
say
however
that
i
have
never
seen
del
more
excited
than
during
the
minutes
few
or
many
i
do
not
know
how
few
or
how
many
that
it
lasted
every
guide
wants
his
canoe
to
beat
and
it
was
evident
from
the
first
that
this
was
the
trout
of
the
expedition
i
know
that
del
believed
i
would
never
bring
that
fish
to
the
canoe
and
when
those
heavy
rushes
came
i
was
harrassed
with
doubts
myself
then
little
by
little
he
yielded
when
at
last
he
was
over
in
the
slower
water
out
of
the
main
channel
i
began
to
have
faith
so
he
came
in
slowly
slowly
and
as
he
was
drawn
nearer
to
the
boat
del
seized
the
net
to
be
ready
for
him
but
i
took
the
net
i
had
been
browbeaten
and
humiliated
and
would
make
my
triumph
complete
i
brought
him
to
the
very
side
of
the
boat
and
i
lifted
him
in
this
time
the
big
fish
did
not
get
away
we
went
to
where
the
others
had
been
watching
and
i
stepped
out
and
tossed
him
carelessly
on
the
ground
as
if
it
were
but
an
everyday
occurrence
eddie
was
crushed
i
no
longer
felt
bitterness
toward
him
i
think
i
shall
not
give
the
weight
of
that
fish
as
already
stated
no
one
can
tell
the
truth
concerning
a
big
fish
the
first
trial
while
more
than
one
attempt
does
not
look
well
in
print
and
is
apt
to
confuse
the
reader
besides
i
do
think
eddie
scales
were
right
anyway
chapter
breathe
a
sigh
and
a
long
the
wilderness
back
again
to
the
trails
of
the
chapter
through
the
a
long
and
fruitful
rapid
we
entered
our
old
first
lake
kedgeemakoogee
this
time
from
another
point
we
had
made
an
irregular
loop
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
or
more
a
loop
that
had
extended
far
into
the
remoter
wilderness
and
had
been
marked
by
what
to
me
were
hard
ventures
and
vicissitudes
but
which
viewed
in
the
concrete
was
recorded
in
my
soul
as
a
link
of
pure
happiness
we
were
not
to
go
home
immediately
kedgeemakoogee
is
large
and
there
are
entering
streams
at
the
mouth
of
which
the
sport
at
this
season
was
good
besides
the
teams
that
were
to
come
for
us
would
not
be
due
yet
for
several
days
if
we
had
kept
proper
account
of
time
it
was
above
the
at
george
run
that
eddie
had
his
first
and
only
success
with
dry
flies
it
was
just
the
place
a
current
between
two
islands
with
many
vicious
and
hungry
trout
they
would
rise
to
the
ordinary
fly
two
at
a
cast
and
when
eddie
put
on
the
dry
fly
the
artificial
miller
that
sits
upright
on
the
water
and
is
an
exact
imitation
of
the
real
article
and
let
it
go
floating
down
they
snapped
it
up
eagerly
it
is
beautiful
fishing
i
should
really
have
liked
to
try
it
a
little
but
eddie
had
been
good
to
me
in
so
many
ways
i
had
the
heart
to
ask
him
for
one
of
his
precious
dry
flies
during
our
trip
across
kedgeemakoogee
del
inspired
perhaps
by
the
fact
that
we
were
getting
nearer
to
the
walks
and
wiles
of
men
gave
me
some
idea
of
nova
scotia
political
economies
he
explained
the
system
of
government
there
the
manner
of
voting
and
the
like
the
representation
is
by
districts
of
course
similar
to
our
own
and
the
parties
have
similar
methods
of
making
the
vote
of
these
districts
count
on
the
right
side
in
queens
for
instance
where
we
had
been
most
if
not
all
of
the
time
the
voters
are
very
scattering
i
had
suspected
this
for
in
our
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
travel
we
had
seen
but
two
natives
and
only
one
of
these
was
believed
to
have
political
residence
del
said
the
district
had
been
gerrymandered
a
good
deal
to
make
the
votes
count
right
and
it
was
plain
enough
that
if
this
man
was
the
only
voter
in
that
much
country
and
he
chasing
bears
most
of
the
time
they
would
have
to
gerrymander
around
a
good
deal
to
keep
up
with
him
del
said
that
when
election
time
came
they
would
go
gunning
for
that
voter
over
the
rocks
and
through
the
burnt
timber
and
would
beat
up
the
brush
for
him
as
if
he
were
a
moose
and
valuable
somehow
politics
did
not
seem
to
belong
in
this
place
but
either
del
exaggerated
this
time
or
there
is
a
good
deal
of
it
to
the
individual
i
suppose
it
well
to
have
it
condensed
in
that
way
we
camped
that
night
at
jim
charles
point
our
old
first
camp
and
it
was
like
getting
home
after
long
absence
for
the
time
seemed
an
age
since
we
had
left
there
it
was
that
any
new
and
wonderful
experience
is
long
as
long
as
eternity
whether
it
be
a
day
or
a
decade
in
duration
next
morning
across
to
the
mouth
of
west
river
a
place
of
many
fish
and
a
rocky
point
for
our
camp
with
deep
beds
of
but
no
trees
that
rocky
open
was
not
the
best
selection
for
tents
eddie
and
his
guide
had
gone
up
the
river
a
little
way
when
a
sudden
shower
came
up
with
heavy
darkness
and
quick
wind
del
and
i
were
stowing
a
few
things
inside
that
were
likely
to
get
wet
when
all
at
once
the
tents
became
balloons
that
were
straining
at
their
guy
ropes
and
then
we
were
bracing
hard
and
clinging
fast
to
the
poles
to
keep
everything
from
sailing
into
the
sky
it
was
a
savage
little
squall
it
laid
the
bushes
down
and
turned
the
lake
white
in
a
jiffy
a
good
thing
nobody
was
out
there
under
that
black
sky
then
the
wind
died
and
there
came
a
swish
of
rain
hard
rain
for
a
few
minutes
after
that
the
sun
once
more
the
fragrance
of
the
fern
and
the
long
sweet
afternoon
looking
at
those
deep
tides
of
i
had
an
inspiration
my
stretcher
had
never
been
over
comfortable
i
longed
to
sleep
flat
why
not
a
couch
of
this
aromatic
balm
it
was
dry
presently
and
spreading
the
canvas
strip
smoothly
on
the
ground
i
covered
it
with
armfuls
of
the
fern
evenly
laid
i
gathered
and
heaped
it
higher
until
it
rose
deep
and
cushiony
then
i
sank
down
upon
it
to
perfect
bliss
this
was
arcady
indeed
a
couch
as
soft
and
as
fragrant
as
any
the
gods
might
have
spread
by
the
brooks
of
hymettus
in
that
far
time
when
they
stole
out
of
elysium
to
find
joy
in
the
daughters
of
men
such
a
couch
leda
might
have
had
when
the
swan
came
floating
down
to
bestow
celestial
motherhood
i
buried
my
face
in
the
odorous
mass
and
vowed
that
never
again
would
i
cramp
myself
in
a
canvas
trough
between
two
sticks
and
i
never
did
i
could
not
get
again
but
balsam
boughs
were
plentiful
and
properly
laid
in
a
manner
that
all
guides
know
make
a
couch
that
is
wide
and
yielding
and
full
of
rest
up
little
river
whose
stones
like
the
proverbial
worm
turned
when
we
stepped
on
them
and
gave
eddie
a
hard
fall
across
frozen
ocean
a
place
which
justified
its
name
for
it
was
bitterly
cold
there
and
we
did
nothing
but
keep
the
fire
going
and
play
pedro
to
which
end
i
put
on
most
of
my
clothes
and
got
into
my
through
another
stream
and
a
string
of
ponds
loitering
and
exploring
until
the
final
day
it
was
on
one
reach
of
a
smaller
stream
that
we
found
the
beaver
dam
the
only
one
i
ever
saw
or
am
likely
to
see
for
the
race
that
builds
them
is
nearly
done
i
had
been
walking
upstream
and
fishing
some
small
rapids
above
the
others
when
i
saw
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
pool
of
still
water
just
above
i
made
my
way
up
there
it
was
in
reality
a
long
stillwater
but
a
pond
rather
than
a
pool
it
interested
me
very
much
the
dam
was
unlike
any
i
had
ever
seen
for
one
thing
i
could
not
understand
why
a
dam
should
be
in
that
place
for
there
was
no
sign
of
a
sluice
or
other
indication
of
a
log
industry
besides
this
dam
was
not
composed
of
logs
or
of
stone
or
anything
of
the
sort
it
was
a
woven
dam
a
dam
composed
of
sticks
and
brush
and
rushes
and
vines
some
small
trees
and
dirt
made
without
much
design
it
would
seem
but
so
carefully
put
together
and
so
firmly
bound
that
no
piece
of
it
could
work
loose
or
be
torn
away
i
was
wondering
what
people
could
have
put
together
such
a
curious
and
effective
thing
as
that
when
del
came
up
pushing
the
canoe
he
also
was
interested
when
he
saw
it
but
he
knew
what
it
was
it
was
a
beaver
dam
and
they
were
getting
mighty
scarce
there
was
a
law
against
killing
the
little
fellows
but
their
pelts
were
worth
high
prices
and
the
law
did
not
cover
traffic
in
them
so
long
as
that
was
the
case
the
beavers
would
be
killed
i
had
heard
of
beaver
dams
all
my
life
but
somehow
i
had
not
thought
of
their
being
like
this
i
had
not
thought
of
those
little
animals
being
able
to
construct
a
piece
of
engineering
that
in
a
swift
place
like
this
could
stand
freshet
and
rot
year
after
year
and
never
break
away
del
said
he
had
never
known
one
of
them
to
go
out
the
outlet
was
in
the
right
place
and
of
the
proper
size
he
showed
me
some
new
pieces
which
the
builders
had
recently
put
into
the
work
perhaps
because
it
seemed
to
be
weakening
there
he
had
watched
once
and
had
seen
some
beavers
working
they
were
as
intelligent
as
human
beings
they
could
cut
a
tree
of
considerable
size
he
said
and
make
it
fall
in
any
chosen
direction
then
he
showed
me
some
pieces
of
wood
from
which
they
had
gnawed
the
sweet
bark
and
he
explained
how
they
cut
small
trees
and
sank
lengths
of
them
in
the
water
to
keep
the
bark
green
and
fresh
for
future
use
i
listened
and
marveled
i
suppose
i
had
read
of
these
things
but
they
seemed
more
wonderful
when
i
was
face
to
face
with
the
fact
the
other
canoe
came
up
and
it
was
decided
to
cut
a
small
section
out
of
the
dam
to
let
us
through
i
objected
but
was
assured
that
the
beavers
were
not
very
busy
just
now
and
would
not
mind
in
fact
might
rather
enjoy
a
repair
job
which
would
take
them
but
a
brief
time
they
can
do
it
sometime
while
i
making
a
long
carry
charlie
said
but
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
cut
through
charlie
and
del
worked
with
the
ax
and
dragged
and
pulled
with
their
hands
finally
a
narrow
breach
was
made
but
it
would
have
been
about
as
easy
to
unload
the
canoes
and
lift
them
over
up
the
long
hole
we
came
to
the
lodge
its
top
rising
above
the
water
its
entrance
of
course
was
below
the
surface
but
the
guides
said
there
is
always
a
hole
at
the
top
for
air
it
was
a
house
better
on
the
whole
than
many
humans
construct
they
be
scrambling
around
pretty
soon
charlie
said
when
they
find
the
water
getting
lower
in
their
sitting
room
then
they
send
out
a
repair
gang
poor
little
fellers
somebody
likely
get
before
we
come
again
i
know
one
chap
that
got
seven
last
year
it
too
bad
yes
it
is
too
bad
here
is
a
wonderful
race
of
creatures
ingenious
harmless
a
race
from
which
man
doubtless
derived
his
early
lessons
in
constructive
engineering
yet
nova
scotia
is
encouraging
their
assassination
by
permitting
the
traffic
in
their
skins
while
she
salves
her
conscience
by
enacting
a
law
against
their
open
slaughter
nova
scotia
is
a
worthy
province
and
means
well
she
protects
her
moose
and
to
some
extent
her
trout
but
she
ought
to
do
better
by
the
beavers
they
are
among
her
most
industrious
and
worthy
citizens
their
homes
and
their
industries
should
be
protected
also
their
skins
it
ca
be
done
under
the
present
law
you
ca
put
a
price
on
a
man
head
and
keep
him
from
being
shot
even
if
it
is
against
the
law
some
fellow
will
lay
for
him
sure
he
will
sneak
up
and
shoot
him
from
behind
just
as
he
would
sneak
up
and
shoot
a
beaver
and
he
will
collect
his
reward
in
either
case
and
the
law
will
wink
at
him
maybe
it
would
be
no
special
crime
to
shoot
the
man
most
likely
he
deserved
it
but
the
beaver
was
doing
nobody
any
harm
long
ago
he
taught
men
how
to
build
their
houses
and
their
dams
and
to
save
up
food
and
water
for
a
dry
time
even
if
we
no
longer
need
him
he
deserves
our
protection
and
our
tender
regard
footnotes
i
have
just
learned
from
eddie
that
nova
scotia
has
recently
enacted
a
new
law
adequately
protecting
the
beaver
i
shall
leave
the
above
however
as
applying
to
other
and
less
humane
districts
wherever
located
chapter
more
the
woods
are
lee
so
dim
and
far
the
wild
trout
hide
and
the
moose
the
northern
chapter
perhaps
the
brightest
spot
of
that
sad
period
when
we
were
making
ready
to
leave
the
woods
with
all
their
comfort
their
peace
and
their
religion
and
go
back
to
the
harrying
haunts
of
men
to
mingle
with
the
fever
and
fret
of
daily
strife
is
the
memory
of
a
trip
to
jeremy
bay
i
do
know
in
the
least
where
jeremy
bay
is
but
it
is
somewhere
within
an
hour
paddle
of
jim
charles
point
and
it
is
that
hour
and
the
return
that
sticks
with
me
now
it
was
among
the
last
days
of
june
the
most
wonderful
season
in
the
north
woods
the
sun
seems
never
ready
to
set
there
then
and
all
the
world
is
made
of
blues
and
greens
and
the
long
lingering
tones
of
evening
we
had
early
tea
in
preparation
for
the
sunset
fishing
it
was
best
del
said
in
jeremy
bay
about
that
time
so
it
was
perhaps
an
hour
earlier
when
we
started
the
canoes
light
in
any
one
life
there
are
not
many
evenings
such
as
that
it
is
just
as
well
for
i
should
account
it
a
permanent
sadness
if
they
became
monotonous
perhaps
they
never
would
our
course
lay
between
shores
an
island
on
the
one
hand
the
mainland
on
the
other
when
we
rounded
the
point
we
were
met
by
a
breeze
blown
straight
from
the
sunset
a
breath
that
was
wild
and
fresh
and
sweet
and
billowed
the
water
till
it
caught
every
hue
and
shimmering
iridescence
that
the
sky
and
shores
and
setting
sun
could
give
we
were
eager
and
rested
for
we
had
done
little
that
day
and
the
empty
canoes
slipped
like
magic
into
a
magical
sea
of
amethyst
and
emerald
gold
the
fresh
breeze
filling
us
with
life
and
ecstasy
until
we
seemed
almost
to
fly
the
eyes
could
not
look
easily
into
the
glory
ahead
though
it
was
less
easy
to
look
away
from
the
enchantment
which
lay
under
the
sunset
the
kingdom
of
ponemah
was
there
and
it
was
as
if
we
were
following
hiawatha
to
that
fair
and
eternal
yet
when
one
did
turn
the
transformation
was
almost
worth
while
the
colors
were
all
changed
they
were
more
peaceful
more
like
reality
less
like
a
harbor
of
dreams
and
visions
too
fair
for
the
eyes
of
man
to
look
upon
a
single
glance
backward
and
then
away
once
more
between
walls
of
green
billowing
into
the
sunset
away
away
to
jeremy
bay
the
sun
was
just
on
the
horizon
when
we
reached
there
the
water
already
in
shadow
near
the
shore
so
deep
and
vivid
were
its
hues
that
we
seemed
to
be
fishing
in
and
the
breeze
went
out
with
the
sun
and
the
painted
pool
became
still
ruffled
only
where
the
trout
broke
water
or
a
bird
dipped
down
to
drink
i
will
not
speak
of
the
fishing
there
i
have
already
promised
that
i
would
not
speak
of
fishing
again
but
jeremy
bay
is
a
spot
that
few
guides
know
and
few
fishermen
find
it
was
our
last
real
fishing
and
it
was
worthy
then
home
to
camp
between
walls
of
dusk
away
away
from
jeremy
bay
silently
slipping
under
darkening
shores
silently
and
a
little
sadly
for
our
long
day
of
joy
was
closing
in
the
hour
of
return
drew
near
and
postpone
it
as
you
will
the
final
moment
must
come
the
time
when
the
rod
must
be
taken
down
for
good
the
leaders
stripped
and
coiled
in
their
box
the
tenderly
gone
over
and
the
last
flies
you
have
used
fitted
into
place
and
laid
away
one
does
not
go
through
that
final
ritual
without
a
little
sentiment
a
little
tugging
about
the
heart
the
flies
were
all
new
and
trim
and
properly
placed
when
you
set
out
they
were
a
gay
array
and
you
were
as
proud
of
them
as
of
a
little
garden
they
are
in
disarray
now
they
have
an
unkempt
look
the
shells
are
shredded
the
feathers
are
caked
and
bitten
the
hackle
is
frazzled
and
frayed
out
yet
you
are
even
more
proud
of
them
than
in
the
beginning
then
they
were
only
a
promise
fair
and
beautiful
to
look
upon
now
they
conjure
up
pictures
of
supreme
fulfillment
days
and
moments
so
firmly
set
upon
the
past
that
they
shall
not
soon
fade
away
that
big
silver
doctor
from
which
the
shell
has
twice
been
broken
and
the
feathers
wrapped
and
rewrapped
that
must
have
been
wound
with
a
special
blessing
for
when
all
else
failed
it
was
a
certain
lure
the
big
trout
below
loon
lake
rose
to
that
fly
and
accordingly
this
battered
thing
will
forever
be
preserved
this
scarlet
breck
with
almost
every
gay
feather
gone
and
the
silver
wrapping
replaced
with
tinfoil
even
when
it
displayed
a
mere
shred
of
its
former
glory
it
proved
far
more
fatal
than
many
a
newer
fly
how
vividly
it
recalls
a
certain
wild
pool
of
strange
dim
lucence
where
for
me
the
trout
would
take
no
other
lure
and
this
montreal
it
has
become
a
magic
brush
that
paints
a
picture
of
black
rocks
and
dark
water
and
my
first
trout
taken
on
a
cast
for
a
hundred
years
if
i
live
that
long
this
crumpled
book
and
these
broken
flies
will
bring
back
the
clear
wild
water
and
the
green
shores
of
a
nova
scotia
june
the
remoter
silences
of
the
deeper
forest
the
bright
camps
by
twisting
pools
and
tumbling
falls
the
flash
of
the
leaping
trout
the
feel
of
the
curved
rod
and
the
music
of
the
singing
reel
i
shall
always
recall
eddie
then
and
i
shall
bless
him
for
many
things
and
forgive
him
for
others
i
shall
remember
del
too
the
stout
and
charles
the
strong
and
that
they
made
my
camping
worth
while
i
was
a
trial
to
them
and
they
were
patient
almost
unreasonably
so
i
am
even
sorry
now
for
the
time
that
my
gun
went
off
and
scared
del
though
it
seemed
amusing
at
the
moment
when
the
wind
beats
up
and
down
the
park
and
the
trees
are
bending
and
cracking
with
ice
when
i
know
that
once
more
the
still
places
of
the
north
are
white
and
the
waters
fettered
i
shall
shut
my
eyes
and
see
again
the
ripple
and
the
toss
of
june
and
hear
once
more
the
under
voices
of
the
falls
and
some
day
i
shall
return
to
those
far
shores
for
it
is
a
place
to
find
soul
yet
perhaps
i
should
not
leave
that
statement
unqualified
for
it
depends
upon
the
sort
of
a
soul
that
is
to
be
found
the
north
wood
does
not
offer
welcome
or
respond
readily
to
the
lover
of
conventional
luxury
and
the
smaller
comforts
of
living
luxury
is
there
surely
but
it
is
the
luxury
that
rewards
effort
and
privation
and
toil
it
is
the
comfort
of
food
and
warmth
and
dry
clothes
after
a
day
of
endurance
a
day
of
wet
and
dragging
weariness
and
bitter
chill
it
is
the
bliss
of
reaching
after
long
toilsome
travel
a
place
where
you
can
meet
the
trout
the
splendid
wild
trout
in
his
native
home
knowing
that
you
