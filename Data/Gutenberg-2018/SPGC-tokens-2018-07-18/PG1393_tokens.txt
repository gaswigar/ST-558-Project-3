over
the
great
windy
waters
and
over
the
summits
unto
the
sun
and
the
sky
and
unto
the
perfecter
earth
come
let
us
go
to
a
land
wherein
gods
of
the
old
time
wandered
where
every
breath
even
now
changes
to
ether
divine
come
let
us
go
though
withal
a
voice
whisper
world
that
we
live
in
whithersoever
we
turn
still
is
the
same
narrow
crib
is
but
to
prove
limitation
and
measure
a
cord
that
we
travel
let
who
would
and
be
free
go
to
his
chamber
and
think
is
but
to
change
idle
fancies
for
memories
wilfully
falser
is
but
to
go
and
have
been
come
little
bark
let
us
go
claude
to
eustace
dear
eustatio
i
write
that
you
may
write
me
an
answer
or
at
the
least
to
put
us
again
en
rapport
with
each
other
rome
disappoints
me
much
st
peter
perhaps
in
especial
only
the
arch
of
titus
and
view
from
the
lateran
please
me
this
however
perhaps
is
the
weather
which
truly
is
horrid
greece
must
be
better
surely
and
yet
i
am
feeling
so
spiteful
that
i
could
travel
to
athens
to
delphi
and
troy
and
mount
sinai
though
but
to
see
with
my
eyes
that
these
are
vanity
also
rome
disappoints
me
much
i
hardly
as
yet
understand
it
but
rubbishy
seems
the
word
that
most
exactly
would
suit
it
all
the
foolish
destructions
and
all
the
sillier
savings
all
the
incongruous
things
of
past
incompatible
ages
seem
to
be
treasured
up
here
to
make
fools
of
present
and
future
would
to
heaven
the
old
goths
had
made
a
cleaner
sweep
of
it
would
to
heaven
some
new
ones
would
come
and
destroy
these
churches
however
one
can
live
in
rome
as
also
in
london
it
is
a
blessing
no
doubt
to
be
rid
at
least
for
a
time
of
all
one
friends
and
relations
yourself
forgive
me
included
all
the
assujettissement
of
having
been
what
one
has
been
what
one
thinks
one
is
or
thinks
that
others
suppose
one
yet
in
despite
of
all
we
turn
like
fools
to
the
english
vernon
has
been
my
fate
who
is
here
the
same
that
you
knew
him
making
the
tour
it
seems
with
friends
of
the
name
of
trevellyn
ii
claude
to
eustace
rome
disappoints
me
still
but
i
shrink
and
adapt
myself
to
it
somehow
a
tyrannous
sense
of
a
superincumbent
oppression
still
wherever
i
go
accompanies
ever
and
makes
me
feel
like
a
tree
shall
i
say
buried
under
a
ruin
of
brickwork
rome
believe
me
my
friend
is
like
its
own
monte
testaceo
merely
a
marvellous
mass
of
broken
and
castaway
ye
gods
what
do
i
want
with
this
rubbish
of
ages
departed
things
that
nature
abhors
the
experiments
that
she
has
failed
in
what
do
i
find
in
the
forum
an
archway
and
two
or
three
pillars
well
but
peter
alas
bernini
has
filled
it
with
sculpture
no
one
can
cavil
i
grant
at
the
size
of
the
great
coliseum
doubtless
the
notion
of
grand
and
capacious
and
massive
amusement
this
the
old
romans
had
but
tell
me
is
this
an
idea
yet
of
solidity
much
but
of
splendour
little
is
extant
i
found
thee
and
marble
i
left
thee
their
emperor
vaunted
i
thought
thee
and
brickwork
i
find
thee
the
tourist
may
answer
iii
georgina
trevellyn
to
louisa
at
last
dearest
louisa
i
take
up
my
pen
to
address
you
here
we
are
you
see
with
the
boxes
courier
papa
and
mamma
the
children
and
mary
and
susan
here
we
all
are
at
rome
and
delighted
of
course
with
peter
and
very
pleasantly
lodged
in
the
famous
piazza
di
spagna
rome
is
a
wonderful
place
but
mary
shall
tell
you
about
it
not
very
gay
however
the
english
are
mostly
at
naples
there
are
the
a
we
hear
and
most
of
the
party
george
however
is
come
did
i
tell
you
about
his
mustachios
dear
i
must
really
stop
for
the
carriage
they
tell
me
is
waiting
mary
will
finish
and
susan
is
writing
they
say
to
sophia
adieu
dearest
louise
evermore
your
faithful
georgina
who
can
a
claude
be
whom
george
has
taken
to
be
with
very
stupid
i
think
but
george
says
so
very
clever
iv
claude
to
eustace
no
the
christian
faith
as
at
any
rate
i
understood
it
with
its
humiliations
and
exaltations
combining
exaltations
sublime
and
yet
diviner
abasements
aspirations
from
something
most
shameful
here
upon
earth
and
in
our
poor
selves
to
something
most
perfect
above
in
the
heavens
no
the
christian
faith
as
i
at
least
understood
it
is
not
here
o
rome
in
any
of
these
thy
churches
is
not
here
but
in
freiburg
or
rheims
or
westminster
abbey
what
in
thy
dome
i
find
in
all
thy
recenter
efforts
is
a
something
i
think
more
rational
far
more
earthly
actual
less
ideal
devout
not
in
scorn
and
refusal
but
in
a
positive
calm
acceptance
this
i
begin
to
detect
in
peter
and
some
of
the
churches
mostly
in
all
that
i
see
of
the
masters
overlaid
of
course
with
infinite
gauds
and
gewgaws
innocent
playful
follies
the
toys
and
trinkets
of
childhood
forced
on
maturer
years
as
the
serious
one
thing
needful
by
the
barbarian
will
of
the
rigid
and
ignorant
spaniard
curious
work
meantime
society
how
we
walk
a
livelong
day
great
heaven
and
watch
our
shadows
what
our
shadows
seem
forsooth
we
will
ourselves
be
do
i
look
like
that
you
think
me
that
then
i
am
that
claude
to
eustace
luther
they
say
was
unwise
like
a
german
he
could
not
see
that
old
follies
were
passing
most
tranquilly
out
of
remembrance
leo
the
tenth
was
employing
all
efforts
to
clear
out
abuses
jupiter
juno
and
venus
fine
arts
and
fine
letters
the
poets
scholars
and
sculptors
and
painters
were
quietly
clearing
away
the
martyrs
and
virgins
and
saints
or
at
any
rate
thomas
aquinas
he
must
forsooth
make
a
fuss
and
distend
his
huge
wittenberg
lungs
and
bring
back
theology
once
yet
again
in
a
flood
upon
europe
lo
you
for
forty
days
from
the
windows
of
heaven
it
fell
the
waters
prevail
on
the
earth
yet
more
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
are
they
abating
at
last
the
doves
that
are
sent
to
explore
are
wearily
fain
to
return
at
the
best
with
a
leaflet
of
promise
fain
to
return
as
they
went
to
the
wandering
vessel
fain
to
the
roof
which
covers
the
clean
and
the
unclean
luther
they
say
was
unwise
he
did
see
how
things
were
going
luther
was
foolish
but
o
great
god
what
call
you
ignatius
o
my
tolerant
soul
be
still
but
you
talk
of
barbarians
alaric
attila
genseric
why
they
came
they
killed
they
ravaged
and
went
on
their
way
but
these
vile
tyrannous
spaniards
these
are
here
still
how
long
o
ye
heavens
in
the
country
of
dante
these
that
fanaticized
europe
which
now
can
forget
them
release
not
this
their
choicest
of
prey
this
italy
here
you
see
them
here
with
emasculate
pupils
and
gimcrack
churches
of
gesu
and
lies
and
postures
here
with
metallic
beliefs
and
regimental
devotions
here
overcrusting
with
slime
perverting
defacing
debasing
michael
angelo
dome
that
had
hung
the
pantheon
in
heaven
raphael
joys
and
graces
and
thy
clear
stars
galileo
vi
claude
to
eustace
which
of
three
misses
trevellyn
it
is
that
vernon
shall
marry
is
not
a
thing
to
be
known
for
our
friend
is
one
of
those
natures
which
have
their
perfect
delight
in
the
general
so
that
he
trifles
with
mary
shawl
ties
susan
bonnet
dances
with
all
but
at
home
is
most
they
say
with
georgina
who
is
however
too
silly
in
my
apprehension
for
vernon
i
as
before
when
i
wrote
continue
to
see
them
a
little
not
that
i
like
them
much
or
care
a
bajocco
for
vernon
but
i
am
slow
at
italian
have
not
many
english
acquaintance
and
i
am
asked
in
short
and
am
not
good
at
excuses
people
these
bankers
very
likely
not
wholly
pure
of
the
taint
of
the
shop
will
at
table
and
restaurant
have
their
shilling
worth
their
penny
pennyworth
even
neither
man
aristocracy
this
nor
god
god
knoweth
yet
they
are
fairly
descended
they
give
you
to
know
well
connected
doubtless
somewhere
in
some
neighbourhood
have
and
are
careful
to
keep
some
relations
who
in
their
turn
are
enchanted
grandly
among
county
people
to
introduce
at
assemblies
to
the
unpennied
cadets
our
cousins
with
excellent
fortunes
neither
man
aristocracy
this
nor
god
god
knoweth
vii
claude
to
eustace
ah
what
a
shame
indeed
to
abuse
these
most
worthy
people
ah
what
a
sin
to
have
sneered
at
their
innocent
rustic
pretensions
is
it
not
laudable
really
this
reverent
worship
of
station
is
it
not
fitting
that
wealth
should
tender
this
homage
to
culture
is
it
not
touching
to
witness
these
efforts
if
little
availing
painfully
made
to
perform
the
old
ritual
service
of
manners
shall
not
devotion
atone
for
the
absence
of
knowledge
and
fervour
palliate
cover
the
fault
of
a
superstitious
observance
dear
dear
what
do
i
say
but
alas
just
now
like
iago
i
can
be
nothing
at
all
if
it
is
not
critical
wholly
so
in
fantastic
height
in
coxcomb
exaltation
here
in
the
garden
i
walk
can
freely
concede
to
the
maker
that
the
works
of
his
hand
are
all
very
good
his
creatures
beast
of
the
field
and
fowl
he
brings
them
before
me
i
name
them
that
which
i
name
them
they
are
the
bird
the
beast
and
the
cattle
but
for
adam
alas
poor
critical
coxcomb
adam
but
for
adam
there
is
not
found
an
for
him
viii
claude
to
eustace
no
great
dome
of
agrippa
thou
art
not
christian
canst
not
strip
and
replaster
and
daub
and
do
what
they
will
with
thee
be
so
here
underneath
the
great
porch
of
colossal
corinthian
columns
here
as
i
walk
do
i
dream
of
the
christian
belfries
above
them
or
on
a
bench
as
i
sit
and
abide
for
long
hours
till
thy
whole
vast
round
grows
dim
as
in
dreams
to
my
eyes
i
repeople
thy
niches
not
with
the
martyrs
and
saints
and
confessors
and
virgins
and
children
but
with
the
mightier
forms
of
an
older
austerer
worship
and
i
recite
to
myself
how
eager
for
battle
here
stood
vulcan
here
matronal
juno
and
with
the
bow
to
his
shoulder
faithful
he
who
with
pure
dew
laveth
of
castaly
his
flowing
locks
who
holdeth
of
lycia
the
oak
forest
and
the
wood
that
bore
him
delos
and
patara
own
apollo
hic
avidus
stetit
vulcanus
hic
matrona
juno
et
nunquam
humeris
positurus
arcum
qui
rore
puro
castaliae
lavit
crines
solutos
qui
lyciae
tenet
dumeta
natalemque
silvam
delius
et
patareus
apollo
ix
claude
to
eustace
yet
it
is
pleasant
i
own
it
to
be
in
their
company
pleasant
whatever
else
it
may
be
to
abide
in
the
feminine
presence
pleasant
but
wrong
will
you
say
but
this
happy
serene
coexistence
is
to
some
poor
soft
souls
i
fear
a
necessity
simple
meat
and
drink
and
life
and
music
filling
with
sweetness
thrilling
with
melody
sweet
with
harmonies
strange
overwhelming
all
the
strings
of
an
awkward
meaningless
fabric
yet
as
for
that
i
could
live
i
believe
with
children
to
have
those
pure
and
delicate
forms
encompassing
moving
about
you
this
were
enough
i
could
think
and
truly
with
glad
resignation
could
from
the
dream
of
romance
from
the
fever
of
flushed
adolescence
look
to
escape
and
subside
into
peaceful
avuncular
functions
nephews
and
nieces
alas
for
as
yet
i
have
none
and
moreover
mothers
are
jealous
i
fear
me
too
often
too
rightfully
fathers
think
they
have
title
exclusive
to
spoiling
their
own
little
darlings
and
by
the
law
of
the
land
in
despite
of
malthusian
doctrine
no
sort
of
proper
provision
is
made
for
that
most
patriotic
most
meritorious
subject
the
childless
and
bachelor
uncle
claude
to
eustace
ye
too
marvellous
twain
that
erect
on
the
monte

stand
by
your
rearing
steeds
in
the
grace
of
your
motionless
movement
stand
with
your
upstretched
arms
and
tranquil
regardant
faces

as
instinct
with
life
in
the
might
of
immutable
manhood
o
ye
mighty
and
strange
ye
ancient
divine
ones
of
hellas
are
ye
christian
too
to
convert
and
redeem
and
renew
you
will
the
brief
form
have
sufficed

set

maladroit
manners

me
often

i
hate
childe

but
also

sometimes
adventures
on
schiller
and
then

questions
me
much
about
oxford
and
yet
in
her
loftiest
flights
still
grates
the
fastidious
ear
with
the
slightly
mercantile
accent
is
it
contemptible
eustace
i
perfectly
ready
to
think
so
is
it
the
horrible
pleasure
of
pleasing
inferior
people
i
am
ashamed
of
my
own
self
and
yet
true
it
is
if
disgraceful
that
for
the
first
time
in
life
i
am
living
and
moving
with
freedom
i
who
never
could
talk
to
the
people
i
meet
with
my

who
have
always
failed

i
am
glad
to
be
liked
and
like
in

very
kindly
so
it
proceeds
laissez
faire
laissez

such
is
the
watchword
well
i
know
there
are
thousands
as
pretty
and
hundreds
as
pleasant
girls
by
the
dozen
as
good
and
girls
in
abundance
with
polish
higher
and
manners
more
perfect
than
susan
or
mary
trevellyn
well
i
know
after
all
it
is
only
juxtaposition
juxtaposition
in
short
and
what
is
juxtaposition
xii
claude

but
i
am
in
for
it
now
laissez
faire
of
a
truth
laissez
aller
yes
i
am
going
i
feel
it
i
feel
and
can
not
recall
it
fusing
with
this
thing
and
that
entering
into
all
sorts
of
relations
tying
i
know
not
what
ties
which
whatever
they
are
i
know
one
thing
will
and
must
woe
is
me
be
one
day
painfully
broken
broken
with
painful
remorses
with
shrinkings
of
soul
and
relentings
foolish
delays
more
foolish
evasions
most
foolish
renewals
but
i
have
made
the
step
have
quitted
the
ship
of
ulysses
quitted
the
sea
and
the
shore
passed
into
the
magical
island

on
my
lips

georgina
trevellyn
to
louisa
dearest
louisa
inquire
if
you
please
about
claude
he
has
been
once
at
and
remembers
meeting
the
harriet
perhaps
may
be
able
to
tell
you
about
him
it
is
an
awkward
youth
but
still
with
very
good
manners
not
without
prospects
we
hear
and
george
says
highly
connected
georgy
declares
it
absurd
but
mamma
is
alarmed
and
insists
he
has
taken
up
strange
opinions
and
may
be
turning
a
papist
certainly
once
he
spoke
of
a
daily
service
he
went
to
we
asked
and
he
laughed
and
answered
the
pantheon
this
was
a
temple
you
know
and
now
is
a
catholic
church
and
though
it
is
said
that
mazzini
has
sold
it
for
protestant
service
yet
i
suppose
this
change
can
hardly
as
yet
be
effected
adieu
again
evermore
my
dearest
your
loving

i
am
to
tell
you
you
say
what
i
think
of
our
last
new
acquaintance
well
then
i
think
that
george
has
a
very
fair
right
to
be
jealous
i
do
not
like
him
much
though
i
do
not
dislike
being
with
him
he
is
what
people
call
i
suppose
a
superior
man
and
certainly
seems
so
to
me
but
i
think
he
is
terribly
selfish
alba
thou
findest
me
still
and
alba
thou
findest
me
ever

now
over

from

that
spread
from

line
cut
of

beautiful
can
i
not
call
thee
and
yet
thou
hast
power
to
power
of
mere
beauty
in
dreams
alba
thou
hauntest
me
still
is
it
religion
i
ask
me
or
is
it
a
vain
superstition
slavery
abject
and
gross
service
too
feeble
of
truth
is
it
an
idol
i
bow
to
or
is
it
a
god
that
i
worship
do
i
sink
back
on
the
old
or
do
i
soar
from
the
mean
so
through
the
city
i
wander
and
question
unsatisfied
ever
reverent
so
i
accept
doubtful
because
i
revere
canto
ii
is
it
illusion
or
does
there
a
spirit
from
perfecter
ages
here
even
yet
amid
loss
change
and
corruption
abide
does
there
a
spirit
we
know
not
though
seek
though
we
find
comprehend
not
here
to
entice
and
confuse
tempt
and
evade
us

in
the
exquisite
grace
of
the
column
disjointed
and

the
rude
masses
of
brick
garlanded
gaily
with

in
the

fantastic
surviving
that
springs
from

is
it

is
it

or
not
that

the

what
do
the
people
say
and
what
does
the
government
do
you
ask
and
i
know
not
at
all
yet
fortune
will
favour
your
hopes
and
i
who
avoided
it
all
am
fated
it
seems
to
describe
it
i
who
nor
meddle
nor
make
in
politics
i
who
sincerely
put
not
my
trust
in
leagues
nor
any
suffrage
by
ballot
never
predicted
parisian
millenniums
never
beheld
a
new
jerusalem
coming
down
dressed
like
a
bride
out
of
heaven
right
on
the
place
de
la
concorde
i
nevertheless
let
me
say
it
could
in
my
soul
of
souls
this
day
with
the
gaul
at
the
gates
shed
one
true
tear
for
thee
thou
poor
little
roman
republic
what
with
the
german
restored
with
sicily
safe
to
the
bourbon
not
leave
one
poor
corner
for
native
italian
exertion
france
it
is
foully
done
and
you
poor
foolish
england
you
who
a
twelvemonth
ago
said
nations
must
choose
for
themselves
you
could
not
of
course
interfere
you
now
when
a
nation
has
chosen
pardon
this
folly
the
times
will
of
course
have
announced
the
occasion
told
you
the
news
of
and
although
it
was
slightly
in
error
when
it
proclaimed
as
a
fact
the
apollo
was
sold
to
a
yankee
you
may
believe
when
it
tells
you
the
french
are
at
civita
vecchia
ii
claude
to
eustace
dulce
it
is
and
decorum
no
doubt
for
the
country
to
fall
to
offer
one
blood
an
oblation
to
freedom
and
die
for
the
cause
yet
still
individual
culture
is
also
something
and
no
man
finds
quite
distinct
the
assurance
that
he
of
all
others
is
called
on
or
would
be
justified
even
in
taking
away
from
the
world
that
precious
creature
himself
nature
sent
him
here
to
abide
here
else
why
send
him
at
all
nature
wants
him
still
it
is
likely
on
the
whole
we
are
meant
to
look
after
ourselves
it
is
certain
each
has
to
eat
for
himself
digest
for
himself
and
in
general
care
for
his
own
dear
life
and
see
to
his
own
preservation
nature
intentions
in
most
things
uncertain
in
this
are
decisive
which
on
the
whole
i
conjecture
the
romans
will
follow
and
i
shall
so
we
cling
to
our
rocks
like
limpets
ocean
may
bluster
over
and
under
and
round
us
we
open
our
shells
to
imbibe
our
nourishment
close
them
again
and
are
safe
fulfilling
the
purpose
nature
intended
a
wise
one
of
course
and
a
noble
we
doubt
not
sweet
it
may
be
and
decorous
perhaps
for
the
country
to
die
but
on
the
whole
we
conclude
the
romans
wo
do
it
and
i
iii
claude
to
eustace
will
they
fight
they
say
so
and
will
the
french
i
can
hardly
hardly
think
so
and
yet
he
is
come
they
say
to
palo
he
is
passed
from
monterone
at
santa
severa
he
hath
laid
up
his
guns
but
the
virgin
the
daughter
of
roma
she
hath
despised
thee
and
laughed
thee
to
scorn
the
daughter
of
tiber
she
hath
shaken
her
head
and
built
barricades
against
thee
will
they
fight
i
believe
it
alas
is
ephemeral
folly
vain
and
ephemeral
folly
of
course
compared
with
pictures
statues
and
antique
gems
indeed
and
yet
indeed
too
yet
methought
in
broad
day
did
i
dream
tell
it
not
in
james
whisper
it
not
in
thy
courts
o
christ
church
yet
did
i
waking
dream
of
a
cadence
that
sings
si
tombent
nos
jeunes
heros
la
terre
en
produit
de
nouveaux
contre
vous
tous
prets
a
se
battre
dreamt
of
great
indignations
and
angers
transcendental
dreamt
of
a
sword
at
my
side
and
a
underneath
me
iv
claude
to
eustace
now
supposing
the
french
or
the
neapolitan
soldier
should
by
some
evil
chance
come
exploring
the
maison
serny
where
the
family
english
are
all
to
assemble
for
safety
am
i
prepared
to
lay
down
my
life
for
the
british
female
really
who
knows
one
has
bowed
and
talked
till
little
by
little
all
the
natural
heat
has
escaped
of
the
chivalrous
spirit
oh
one
conformed
of
course
but
one
does
die
for
good
manners
stab
or
shoot
or
be
shot
by
way
of
graceful
attention
no
if
it
should
be
at
all
it
should
be
on
the
barricades
there
should
i
incarnadine
ever
this
inky
pacifical
finger
sooner
far
should
it
be
for
this
vapour
of
italy
freedom
sooner
far
by
the
side
of
the
d
d
and
dirty
plebeians
ah
for
a
child
in
the
street
i
could
strike
for
the
lady
somehow
eustace
alas
i
have
not
felt
the
vocation
yet
these
people
of
course
will
expect
as
of
course
my
protection
vernon
in
radiant
arms
stand
forth
for
the
lovely
georgina
and
to
appear
i
suppose
were
but
common
civility
yes
and
truly
i
do
not
desire
they
should
either
be
killed
or
offended
oh
and
of
course
you
will
say
the
time
comes
you
will
be
ready
ah
but
before
it
comes
am
i
to
presume
it
will
be
so
what
i
can
not
feel
now
am
i
to
suppose
that
i
shall
feel
am
i
not
free
to
attend
for
the
ripe
and
indubious
instinct
am
i
forbidden
to
wait
for
the
clear
and
lawful
perception
is
it
the
calling
of
man
to
surrender
his
knowledge
and
insight
for
the
mere
venture
of
what
may
perhaps
be
the
virtuous
action
must
we
walking
our
earth
discerning
a
little
and
hoping
some
plain
visible
task
shall
yet
for
our
hands
be
assigned
us
must
we
abandon
the
future
for
fear
of
omitting
the
present
quit
our
own
fireside
hopes
at
the
alien
call
of
a
neighbour
to
the
mere
possible
shadow
of
deity
offer
the
victim
and
is
all
this
my
friend
but
a
weak
and
ignoble
refining
wholly
unworthy
the
head
or
the
heart
of
your
own
correspondent
claude
to
eustace
yes
we
are
fighting
at
last
it
appears
this
morning
as
usual
murray
as
usual
in
hand
i
enter
the
caffe
nuovo
seating
myself
with
a
sense
as
it
were
of
a
change
in
the
weather
not
understanding
however
but
thinking
mostly
of
murray
and
for
is
their
day
of
the
campidoglio
marbles
i
call
to
the
waiter
and
non
latte
this
is
the
answer
he
makes
me
and
this
is
the
sign
of
a
battle
so
i
sit
and
truly
they
seem
to
think
any
one
else
more
worthy
than
me
of
attention
i
wait
for
my
milkless
nero
free
to
observe
undistracted
all
sorts
and
sizes
of
persons
blending
civilian
and
soldier
in
strangest
costume
coming
in
and
gulping
in
hottest
haste
still
standing
their
coffee
withdrawing
eagerly
jangling
a
sword
on
the
steps
or
jogging
a
musket
slung
to
the
shoulder
behind
they
are
fewer
moreover
than
usual
much
and
silenter
far
and
so
i
begin
to
imagine
something
is
really
afloat
ere
i
leave
the
caffe
is
empty
empty
too
the
streets
in
all
its
length
the
corso
empty
and
empty
i
see
to
my
right
and
left
the
condotti
twelve
on
the
pincian
hill
with
lots
of
english
germans
americans
french
the
frenchmen
too
are
protected
so
we
stand
in
the
sun
but
afraid
of
a
probable
shower
so
we
stand
and
stare
and
see
to
the
left
of
peter
smoke
from
the
cannon
white
but
that
is
at
intervals
only
black
from
a
burning
house
we
suppose
by
the
cavalleggieri
and
we
believe
we
discern
some
lines
of
men
descending
down
through
the
and
catch
a
bayonet
gleaming
every
ten
minutes
however
in
this
there
is
no
misconception
comes
a
great
white
puff
from
behind
michel
angelo
dome
and
after
a
space
the
report
of
a
real
big
gun
not
the
frenchman
that
must
be
doing
some
work
and
so
we
watch
and
conjecture
shortly
an
englishman
comes
who
says
he
has
been
to
peter
seen
the
piazza
and
troops
but
that
is
all
he
can
tell
us
so
we
watch
and
sit
and
indeed
it
begins
to
be
all
this
smoke
is
outside
when
it
has
come
to
the
inside
it
will
be
time
perhaps
to
descend
and
retreat
to
our
houses
one
or
two
the
report
of
small
arms
frequent
sharp
and
savage
indeed
that
can
not
all
be
for
nothing
so
we
watch
and
wonder
but
guessing
is
tiresome
very
weary
of
wondering
watching
and
guessing
and
gossiping
idly
down
i
go
and
pass
through
the
quiet
streets
with
the
knots
of
national
guards
patrolling
and
flags
hanging
out
at
the
windows
english
american
danish
and
after
offering
to
help
an
irish
family
moving
en
masse
to
the
maison
serny
after
endeavouring
idly
to
minister
balm
to
the
trembling
quinquagenarian
fears
of
two
lone
british
spinsters
go
to
make
sure
of
my
dinner
before
the
enemy
enter
but
by
this
there
are
signs
of
stragglers
returning
and
voices
talk
though
you
do
believe
it
of
guns
and
prisoners
taken
and
on
the
walls
you
read
the
first
bulletin
of
the
this
is
all
that
i
saw
and
all
that
i
know
of
the
battle
vi
claude
to
eustace
victory
victory
yes
ah
yes
thou
republican
zion
truly
the
kings
of
the
earth
are
gathered
and
gone
by
together
doubtless
they
marvelled
to
witness
such
things
were
astonished
and
so
forth
victory
victory
victory
ah
but
it
is
believe
me
easier
easier
far
to
intone
the
chant
of
the
martyr
than
to
indite
any
paean
of
any
victory
death
may
sometimes
be
noble
but
life
at
the
best
will
appear
an
illusion
while
the
great
pain
is
upon
us
it
is
great
when
it
is
over
why
it
is
over
the
smoke
of
the
sacrifice
rises
to
heaven
of
a
sweet
savour
no
doubt
to
somebody
but
on
the
altar
lo
there
is
nothing
remaining
but
ashes
and
dirt
and
ill
odour
so
it
stands
you
perceive
the
labial
muscles
that
swelled
with
vehement
evolution
of
yesterday
marseillaises
articulations
sublime
of
defiance
and
scorning
lapse
and
languidly
mumble
while
men
and
women
and
papers
scream
and
to
each
other
the
chorus
of
victory
well
but
i
am
thankful
they
fought
and
glad
that
the
frenchmen
were
beaten
vii
claude
to
eustace
so
i
have
seen
a
man
killed
an
experience
that
among
others
yes
i
suppose
i
have
although
i
can
hardly
be
certain
and
in
a
court
of
justice
could
never
declare
i
had
seen
it
but
a
man
was
killed
i
am
told
in
a
place
where
i
saw
something
a
man
was
killed
i
am
told
and
i
saw
something
i
was
returning
home
from
peter
murray
as
usual
under
my
arm
i
remember
had
crossed
the
angelo
bridge
and
moving
towards
the
condotti
had
got
to
the
first
barricade
when
gradually
thinking
still
of
peter
i
became
conscious
of
a
sensation
of
movement
opposing
me
tendency
this
way
such
as
one
fancies
may
be
in
a
stream
when
the
wave
of
the
tide
is
coming
and
not
yet
come
a
sort
of
noise
and
retention
so
i
turned
and
before
i
turned
caught
sight
of
stragglers
heading
a
crowd
it
is
plain
that
is
coming
behind
that
corner
looking
up
i
see
windows
filled
with
heads
the
piazza
into
which
you
remember
the
ponte
angelo
enters
since
i
passed
has
thickened
with
curious
groups
and
now
the
crowd
is
coming
has
turned
has
crossed
that
last
barricade
is
here
at
my
side
in
the
middle
they
drag
at
something
what
is
it
ha
bare
swords
in
the
air
held
up
there
seem
to
be
voices
pleading
and
hands
putting
back
official
perhaps
but
the
swords
are
many
and
bare
in
the
air
in
the
air
they
descend
they
are
smiting
hewing
chopping
at
what
in
the
air
once
more
upstretched
and
is
it
blood
that
on
them
yes
certainly
blood
of
whom
then
over
whom
is
the
cry
of
this
furor
of
exultation
while
they
are
skipping
and
screaming
and
dancing
their
caps
on
the
points
of
swords
and
bayonets
i
to
the
outskirts
back
and
ask
a
bystander
is
it
and
he
looking
always
that
way
makes
me
answer
priest
who
was
trying
to
fly
to
the
neapolitan
army
and
thus
explains
the
proceeding
you
did
see
the
dead
man
no
i
began
to
be
doubtful
i
was
in
black
myself
and
did
know
what
might
happen
but
a
national
guard
close
by
me
outside
of
the
hubbub
broke
his
sword
with
slashing
a
broad
hat
covered
with
dust
and
passing
away
from
the
place
with
murray
under
my
arm
and
stooping
i
saw
through
the
legs
of
the
people
the
legs
of
a
body
you
are
the
first
do
you
know
to
whom
i
have
mentioned
the
matter
whom
should
i
tell
it
to
else
these
girls
the
heavens
forbid
it
quidnuncs
at
monaldini
idlers
upon
the
pincian
if
i
rightly
remember
it
happened
on
that
afternoon
when
word
of
the
nearer
approach
of
a
new
neapolitan
army
first
was
spread
i
began
to
bethink
me
of
paris
septembers
thought
i
could
fancy
the
look
of
that
old
on
that
evening
three
or
four
or
it
may
be
five
of
these
people
were
slaughtered
some
declared
they
had
one
of
them
fired
on
a
sentinel
others
say
they
were
only
escaping
a
priest
it
is
currently
stated
stabbed
a
national
guard
on
the
very
piazza
colonna
history
rumour
of
rumours
i
leave
to
thee
to
determine
but
i
am
thankful
to
say
the
government
seems
to
have
strength
to
put
it
down
it
has
vanished
at
least
the
place
is
most
peaceful
through
the
trastevere
walking
last
night
at
nine
of
the
clock
i
found
no
sort
of
disorder
i
crossed
by
the
so
by
the
narrow
streets
to
the
ponte
rotto
and
onwards
thence
by
the
temple
of
vesta
away
to
the
great
coliseum
which
at
the
full
of
the
moon
is
an
object
worthy
a
visit
viii
georgina
trevellyn
to
louisa
only
think
dearest
louisa
what
fearful
scenes
we
have
witnessed
george
has
just
seen
garibaldi
dressed
up
in
a
long
white
cloak
on
horseback
riding
by
with
his
mounted
negro
behind
him
this
is
a
man
you
know
who
came
from
america
with
him
out
of
the
woods
i
suppose
and
uses
a
lasso
in
fighting
which
is
i
do
quite
know
but
a
sort
of
noose
i
imagine
this
he
throws
on
the
heads
of
the
enemy
men
in
a
battle
pulls
them
into
his
reach
and
then
most
cruelly
kills
them
mary
does
not
believe
but
we
heard
it
from
an
italian
mary
allows
she
was
wrong
about
claude
being
selfish
he
was
most
useful
and
kind
on
the
terrible
thirtieth
of
april
do
not
write
here
any
more
we
are
starting
directly
for
florence
we
should
be
off
if
only
papa
could
get
horses
all
have
been
seized
everywhere
for
the
use
of
this
dreadful
mazzini
mary
has
seen
thus
i
am
really
so
angry
louisa
quite
out
of
patience
my
dearest
what
can
the
man
be
intending
i
am
quite
tired
and
mary
who
might
bring
him
to
in
a
moment
lets
him
go
on
as
he
likes
and
neither
will
help
nor
dismiss
him
ix
claude
to
eustace
it
is
most
curious
to
see
what
a
power
a
few
calm
words
in
merely
a
brief
proclamation
appear
to
possess
on
the
people
order
is
perfect
and
peace
the
city
is
utterly
tranquil
and
one
can
not
conceive
that
this
easy
and
nonchalant
crowd
that
flows
like
a
quiet
stream
through
street
and
entering
shady
recesses
and
bays
of
church
osteria
and
caffe
could
in
a
moment
be
changed
to
a
flood
as
of
molten
lava
boil
into
deadly
wrath
and
wild
homicidal
delusion
ah
is
an
excellent
race
and
even
in
old
degradation
under
a
rule
that
enforces
to
flattery
lying
and
cheating
under
pope
and
priest
a
nice
and
natural
people
oh
could
they
but
be
allowed
this
chance
of
redemption
but
clearly
that
is
not
likely
to
be
meantime
notwithstanding
all
journals
honour
for
once
to
the
tongue
and
the
pen
of
the
eloquent
writer
honour
to
speech
and
all
honour
to
thee
thou
noble
mazzini
claude
to
eustace
i
am
in
love
meantime
you
think
no
doubt
you
would
think
so
i
am
in
love
you
say
with
those
letters
of
course
you
would
say
so
i
am
in
love
you
declare
i
think
not
so
yet
i
grant
you
it
is
a
pleasure
indeed
to
converse
with
this
girl
oh
rare
gift
rare
felicity
this
she
can
talk
in
a
rational
way
can
speak
upon
subjects
that
really
are
matters
of
mind
and
of
thinking
yet
in
perfection
retain
her
simplicity
never
one
moment
never
however
you
urge
it
however
you
tempt
her
consents
to
step
from
ideas
and
fancies
and
loving
sensations
to
those
vain
conscious
understandings
that
vex
the
minds
of
mankind
no
though
she
talk
it
is
music
her
fingers
desert
not
the
keys
is
song
though
you
hear
in
the
song
the
articulate
vocables
sounded
syllabled
singly
and
sweetly
the
words
of
melodious
meaning
i
am
in
love
you
say
i
do
not
think
so
exactly
xi
claude
to
eustace
there
are
two
different
kinds
i
believe
of
human
attraction
one
which
simply
disturbs
unsettles
and
makes
you
uneasy
and
another
that
poises
retains
and
fixes
and
holds
you
i
have
no
doubt
for
myself
in
giving
my
voice
for
the
latter
i
do
not
wish
to
be
moved
but
growing
where
i
was
growing
there
more
truly
to
grow
to
live
where
as
yet
i
had
languished
i
do
not
like
being
moved
for
the
will
is
excited
and
action
is
a
most
dangerous
thing
i
tremble
for
something
factitious
some
malpractice
of
heart
and
illegitimate
process
we
are
so
prone
to
these
things
with
our
terrible
notions
of
duty
xii
claude
to
eustace
ah
let
me
look
let
me
watch
let
me
wait
unhurried
unprompted
bid
me
not
venture
on
aught
that
could
alter
or
end
what
is
present
say
not
time
flies
and
occasion
that
never
returns
is
departing
drive
me
not
out
yet
ye
ill
angels
with
fiery
swords
from
my
eden
waiting
and
watching
and
looking
let
love
be
its
own
inspiration
shall
not
a
voice
if
a
voice
there
must
be
from
the
airs
that
environ
yea
from
the
conscious
heavens
without
our
knowledge
or
effort
break
into
audible
words
and
love
be
its
own
inspiration
xiii
claude
to
eustace
wherefore
and
how
i
am
certain
i
hardly
can
tell
but
it
is
so
she
does
like
me
eustace
i
think
she
never
will
like
me
is
it
my
fault
as
it
is
my
misfortune
my
ways
are
not
her
ways
is
it
my
fault
that
my
habits
and
modes
are
dissimilar
wholly
is
not
her
fault
is
her
nature
her
virtue
to
misapprehend
them
is
not
her
fault
is
her
beautiful
nature
not
ever
to
know
me
hopeless
it
seems
yet
i
can
not
though
hopeless
determine
to
leave
it
she
goes
therefore
i
go
she
moves
i
move
not
to
lose
her
xiv
claude
to
eustace
oh
is
manly
of
course
is
manly
this
method
of
wooing
is
the
way
very
likely
to
win
for
the
woman
they
tell
you
ever
prefers
the
audacious
the
wilful
the
vehement
hero
she
has
no
heart
for
the
timid
the
sensitive
soul
and
for
knowledge
knowledge
o
ye
gods
when
did
they
appreciate
knowledge
wherefore
should
they
either
i
am
sure
i
do
not
desire
it
ah
and
i
feel
too
eustace
she
cares
not
a
tittle
about
me
care
about
me
indeed
and
do
i
really
expect
it
but
my
manner
offends
my
ways
are
wholly
repugnant
every
word
that
i
utter
estranges
hurts
and
repels
her
every
moment
of
bliss
that
i
gain
in
her
exquisite
presence
slowly
surely
withdraws
her
removes
her
and
severs
her
from
me
not
that
i
care
very
much
any
way
i
escape
from
the
boy
own
folly
to
which
i
am
prone
of
loving
where
it
is
easy
not
that
i
mind
very
much
why
should
i
i
am
not
in
love
and
am
prepared
i
think
if
not
by
previous
habit
yet
in
the
spirit
beforehand
for
this
and
all
that
is
like
it
it
is
an
easier
matter
for
us
contemplative
creatures
us
upon
whom
the
pressure
of
action
is
laid
so
lightly
we
discontented
indeed
with
things
in
particular
idle
sickly
complaining
by
faith
in
the
vision
of
things
in
general
manage
to
hold
on
our
way
without
like
others
around
us
seizing
the
nearest
arm
to
comfort
help
and
support
us
yet
after
all
my
eustace
i
know
but
little
about
it
all
i
can
say
for
myself
for
present
alike
and
for
past
is
mary
trevellyn
eustace
is
certainly
worth
your
acquaintance
you
could
come
i
suppose
as
far
as
florence
to
see
her
xv
georgina
trevellyn
to
louisa
we
starting
for
florence
truly
rejoiced
you
may
guess
to
escape
from
republican
terrors
and
papa
to
escort
us
we
by
vettura
through
siena
and
georgy
to
follow
and
join
us
by
leghorn
then
ah
what
shall
i
say
my
dearest
i
tremble
in
thinking
you
will
imagine
my
feelings
the
blending
of
hope
and
of
sorrow
how
can
i
bear
to
abandon
papa
and
mamma
and
my
sisters
dearest
louise
indeed
it
is
very
alarming
but
trust
me
ever
whatever
may
change
to
remain
your
loving
georgina
by
mary
trevellyn
i
like
claude
any
better
i
am
to
tell
you
and
is
it
susan
or
i
that
attract
him
this
he
never
has
told
but
georgina
could
certainly
ask
him
all
i
can
say
for
myself
is
alas
that
he
rather
repels
me
there
i
think
him
agreeable
but
also
a
little
repulsive
so
be
content
dear
louisa
for
one
satisfactory
marriage
surely
will
do
in
one
year
for
the
family
you
would
establish
neither
susan
nor
i
shall
afford
you
the
joy
of
a
second
by
georgina
trevellyn
claude
you
must
know
is
behaving
a
little
bit
better
he
and
papa
are
great
friends
but
he
really
is
too
so
unlike
george
yet
i
hope
that
the
matte
is
going
on
fairly
i
shall
however
get
george
before
he
goes
to
say
something
dearest
louise
how
delightful
to
bring
young
people
together
is
it
florence
we
follow
or
are
we
to
tarry
yet
longer
amid
clamour
of
arms
here
in
the
city
of
old
seeking
from
clamour
of
arms
in
the
past
and
the
arts
to
be
hidden
vainly
arts
and
the
past
seeking
one
life
to
forget
ah
fair
shadow
scarce
seen
go
forth
for
anon
he
shall
follow
he
that
beheld
thee
anon
whither
thou
leadest
must
go
go
and
the
wise
loving
muse
she
also
will
follow
and
find
thee
she
should
she
linger
in
rome
were
not
dissevered
from
thee
canto
iii
yet
to
the
wondrous
peter
and
yet
to
the
solemn
rotunda
mingling
with
heroes
and
gods
yet
to
the
vatican
walls
yet
may
we
go
and
recline
while
a
whole
mighty
world
seems
above
us
gathered
and
fixed
to
all
time
into
one
roofing
supreme
yet
may
we
thinking
on
these
things
exclude
what
is
meaner
around
us
yet
at
the
worst
of
the
worst
books
and
a
chamber
remain
yet
may
we
think
and
forget
and
possess
our
souls
in
ah
but
away
from
the
stir
shouting
and
gossip
of
war
where
upon
apennine
slope
with
the
chestnut
the
immingle
where
amid
odorous
copse
wander
and
wind
where
under
the
diligent
rivulet
sparkles
or
amid
cotton
and
maize
peasants
their
ply
where
over
and
orange
in
tier
upon
tier
still
repeated
garden
on
garden
upreared
balconies
step
to
the
sky
ah
that
i
were
far
away
from
the
crowd
and
the
streets
of
the
city
under
the
laid
o
my
beloved
with
thee
mary
trevellyn
to
miss
roper
on
the
way
to
florence
why
does
claude
come
with
us
you
we
do
know
you
should
know
better
than
we
he
talked
of
the
vatican
marbles
but
i
ca
wholly
believe
that
this
was
the
actual
reason
he
was
so
ready
before
when
we
asked
him
to
come
and
escort
us
certainly
he
is
odd
my
dear
miss
roper
to
change
so
suddenly
just
for
a
whim
was
not
quite
fair
to
the
party
not
quite
right
i
declare
i
really
almost
am
offended
i
his
great
friend
as
you
say
have
doubtless
a
title
to
be
so
not
that
i
greatly
regret
it
for
dear
georgina
distinctly
wishes
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
show
her
adroitness
but
oh
my
pen
will
not
write
any
more
let
us
say
nothing
further
about
it
yes
my
dear
miss
roper
i
certainly
called
him
repulsive
so
i
think
him
but
can
not
be
sure
i
have
used
the
expression
quite
as
your
pupil
should
yet
he
does
most
truly
repel
me
was
it
to
you
i
made
use
of
the
word
or
who
was
it
told
you
yes
repulsive
observe
it
is
but
when
he
talks
of
ideas
that
he
is
quite
unaffected
and
free
and
expansive
and
easy
i
could
pronounce
him
simply
a
cold
intellectual
when
does
he
make
advances
he
thinks
that
women
should
woo
him
yet
if
a
girl
should
do
so
would
be
but
alarmed
and
disgusted
she
that
should
love
him
must
look
for
small
love
in
return
like
the
ivy
on
the
stone
wall
must
expect
but
a
rigid
and
niggard
support
and
to
get
that
must
go
searching
all
round
with
her
humble
embraces
ii
claude
to
eustace
from
rome
tell
me
my
friend
do
you
think
that
the
grain
would
sprout
in
the
furrow
did
it
not
truly
accept
as
its
summum
and
ultimum
bonum
that
mere
common
and
indifferent
soil
it
is
set
in
would
it
have
force
to
develop
and
open
its
young
cotyledons
could
it
compare
and
reflect
and
examine
one
thing
with
another
would
it
endure
to
accomplish
the
round
of
its
natural
functions
were
it
endowed
with
a
sense
of
the
general
scheme
of
existence
while
from
marseilles
in
the
steamer
we
voyage
to
civita
vecchia
vexed
in
the
squally
seas
as
we
lay
by
capraja
and
elba
standing
uplifted
alone
on
the
heaving
poop
of
the
vessel
looking
around
on
the
waste
of
the
rushing
incurious
billows
is
nature
i
said
are
born
as
it
were
from
her
waters
over
her
billows
that
buffet
and
beat
us
her
offspring
casting
one
single
regard
of
a
painful
victorious
knowledge
into
her
billows
that
buffet
and
beat
us
we
sink
and
are
swallowed
this
was
the
sense
in
my
soul
as
i
swayed
with
the
poop
of
the
steamer
and
as
unthinking
i
sat
in
the
hall
of
the
famed
ariadne
lo
it
looked
at
me
there
from
the
face
of
a
triton
in
marble
it
is
the
simpler
thought
and
i
can
believe
it
the
truer
let
us
not
talk
of
growth
we
are
still
in
our
aqueous
ages
iii
claude
to
eustace
farewell
politics
utterly
what
can
i
do
i
can
not
fight
you
know
and
to
talk
i
am
wholly
ashamed
and
although
i
gnash
my
teeth
when
i
look
in
your
french
or
your
english
papers
what
is
the
good
of
that
will
swearing
i
wonder
mend
matters
cursing
and
scolding
repel
the
assailants
no
it
is
idle
no
whatever
befalls
i
will
hide
will
ignore
or
forget
it
let
the
tail
shift
for
itself
i
will
bury
my
head
and
what
the
roman
republic
to
me
or
i
to
the
roman
republic
why
not
fight
in
the
first
place
i
have
so
much
as
a
musket
in
the
next
if
i
had
i
should
know
how
i
should
use
it
in
the
third
just
at
present
i
studying
ancient
marbles
in
the
fourth
i
consider
i
owe
my
life
to
my
country
in
the
fifth

four
good
reasons

be

not
hurrah
for
the
glorious

though
it
would

this

is
indeed
of

purely
invisible

then
elsewhere
ah
good

but
i
would

not
as
we
read
in
the
words
of
the
inspiration
are
there
two
several
trees
in
the
place
we
are
set
to
abide
in
but
on
the
apex
most
high
of
the
tree
of
life
in
the
garden
budding
unfolding
and
falling
decaying
and
flowering
ever
flowering
is
set
and
decaying
the
transient
blossom
of
knowledge
flowering
alone
and
decaying
the
needless
unfruitful
blossom
or
as
the
by
the
stream
hellespontine
which
from
the
mythical
tomb
of
the
godlike
protesilaus
rose
sympathetic
in
grief
to
his
laodamia
evermore
growing
and
when
in
their
growth
to
the
prospect
attaining
over
the
low
of
the
fatal
ilian
city
withering
still
at
the
sight
which
still
they
upgrow
to
encounter
ah
but
ye
that
extrude
from
the
ocean
your
helpless
faces
ye
over
stormy
seas
leading
long
and
dreary
processions
ye
too
brood
of
the
wind
whose
coming
is
whence
we
discern
not
making
your
nest
on
the
wave
and
your
bed
on
the
crested
billow
skimming
rough
waters
and
crowding
wet
sands
that
the
tide
shall
return
to
cormorants
ducks
and
gulls
fill
ye
my
imagination
let
us
not
talk
of

still
in

ages
mary
trevellyn
to
miss
roper
from
florence
dearest
miss
roper
alas
we
are
all
at
florence
quite
safe
and
you
we
hear
are
shut
up
indeed
it
is
sadly
distressing
we
were
most
lucky
they
say
to
get
off
when
we
did
from
the
troubles
now
you
are
really
besieged
they
tell
us
it
soon
will
be
over
only
i
hope
and
trust
without
any
fight
in
the
city
do
you
see
mr
claude
i
thought
he
might
do
something
for
you
i
am
quite
sure
on
occasion
he
really
would
wish
to
be
useful
what
is
he
doing
i
wonder
still
studying
vatican
marbles
letters
i
hope
pass
through
we
trust
your
brother
is
better
vi
claude
to
eustace
juxtaposition
in
fine
and
what
is
juxtaposition
look
you
we
travel
along
in
the
or
steamer
and
pour
passer
le
temps
till
the
tedious
journey
be
ended
lay
aside
paper
or
book
to
talk
with
the
girl
that
is
next
one
and
pour
passer
le
temps
with
the
terminus
all
but
in
prospect
talk
of
eternal
ties
and
marriages
made
in
heaven
ah
did
we
really
accept
with
a
perfect
heart
the
illusion
ah
did
we
really
believe
that
the
present
indeed
is
the
only
or
through
all
transmutation
all
shock
and
convulsion
of
passion
feel
we
could
carry
undimmed
unextinguished
the
light
of
our
knowledge
but
for
his
funeral
train
which
the
bridegroom
sees
in
the
distance
would
he
so
joyfully
think
you
fall
in
with
the
marriage
procession
but
for
that
final
discharge
would
he
dare
to
enlist
in
that
service
but
for
that
certain
release
ever
sign
to
that
perilous
contract
but
for
that
exit
secure
ever
bend
to
that
treacherous
doorway
ah
but
the
bride
meantime
do
you
think
she
sees
it
as
he
does
but
for
the
steady
of
a
freer
and
larger
existence
think
you
that
man
could
consent
to
be
circumscribed
here
into
action
but
for
assurance
within
a
limitless
ocean
divine
whose
great
tranquil
depths
unconscious
the
surface
breaks
into
ripples
of
trouble
that
come
and
change
and
endure
not
but
that
in
this
of
a
truth
we
have
our
being
and
know
it
think
you
we
men
could
submit
to
live
and
move
as
we
do
here
ah
but
the
women
god
bless
them
they
do
think
at
all
about
it
yet
we
must
eat
and
drink
as
you
say
and
as
limited
beings
scarcely
can
hope
to
attain
upon
earth
to
an
actual
abstract
leaving
to
god
contemplation
to
his
hands
knowledge
confiding
sure
that
in
us
if
it
perish
in
him
it
abideth
and
dies
not
let
us
in
his
sight
accomplish
our
petty
particular
doings
yes
and
contented
sit
down
to
the
victual
that
he
has
provided
allah
is
great
no
doubt
and
juxtaposition
his
prophet
ah
but
the
women
alas
they
do
look
at
it
that
way
juxtaposition
is
great
but
my
friend
i
fear
me
the
maiden
hardly
would
thank
or
acknowledge
the
lover
that
sought
to
obtain
her
not
as
the
thing
he
would
wish
but
the
thing
he
must
even
put
up
with
hardly
would
tender
her
hand
to
the
wooer
that
candidly
told
her
that
she
is
but
for
a
space
an
solace
and
pleasure
that
in
the
end
she
shall
yield
to
a
perfect
and
absolute
something
which
i
then
for
myself
shall
behold
and
not
another
which
amid
fondest
endearments
meantime
i
forget
not
forsake
not
ah
ye
feminine
souls
so
loving
and
so
exacting
since
we
can
not
escape
must
we
even
submit
to
deceive
you
since
so
cruel
is
truth
sincerity
shocks
and
revolts
you
will
you
have
us
your
slaves
to
lie
to
you
flatter
and
leave
you
vii
claude
to
eustace
juxtaposition
is
great
but
you
tell
me
affinity
greater
ah
my
friend
there
are
many
affinities
greater
and
lesser
stronger
and
weaker
and
each
by
the
favour
of
juxtaposition
potent
efficient
in
force
for
a
time
but
none
let
me
tell
you
save
by
the
law
of
the
land
and
the
ruinous
force
of
the
will
ah
none
i
fear
me
at
last
quite
sure
to
be
final
and
perfect
lo
as
i
pace
in
the
street
from
the
to
the
princess
homo
sum
nihil
humani
a
me
alienum
puto
vir
sum
nihil
faeminei
and
to
the
uttermost
circle
all
that
is
nature
is
i
and
i
all
things
that
are
nature
yes
as
i
walk
i
behold
in
a
luminous
large
intuition
that
i
can
be
and
become
anything
that
i
meet
with
or
look
at
i
am
the
ox
in
the
dray
the
ass
with
the
panniers
i
am
the
dog
in
the
doorway
the
kitten
that
plays
in
the
window
on
sunny
slab
of
the
ruin
the
furtive
and
fugitive
lizard
swallow
above
me
that
twitters
and
fly
that
is
buzzing
about
me
yea
and
detect
as
i
go
by
a
faint
but
a
faithful
assurance
from
the
stones
of
the
street
as
from
rocks
or
trees
of
the
forest
something
of
kindred
a
common
though
latent
vitality
greets
me
and
to
escape
from
our
strivings
mistakings
misgrowths
and
perversions
fain
could
demand
to
return
to
that
perfect
and
primitive
silence
fain
be
enfolded
and
fixed
as
of
old
in
their
rigid
embraces
viii
claude
to
eustace
and
as
i
walk
on
my
way
i
behold
them
consorting
and
coupling
faithful
it
seemeth
and
fond
very
fond
very
probably
faithful
all
as
i
go
on
my
way
with
a
pleasure
sincere
and
unmingled
life
is
beautiful
eustace
entrancing
enchanting
to
look
at
as
are
the
streets
of
a
city
we
pace
while
the
carriage
is
changing
as
a
chamber
with
harmonious
exquisite
pictures
even
so
beautiful
earth
and
could
we
eliminate
only
this
vile
hungering
impulse
this
demon
within
us
of
craving
life
were
beatitude
living
a
perfect
divine
satisfaction
ix
claude
to
eustace
mild
monastic
faces
in
quiet
collegiate
cloisters
so
let
me
offer
a
single
and
celibatarian
phrase
a
tribute
to
those
whom
perhaps
you
do
not
believe
i
can
honour
but
from
the
tumult
escaping
is
pleasant
of
drumming
and
shouting
hither
oblivious
awhile
to
withdraw
of
the
fact
or
the
falsehood
and
amid
placid
regards
and
mildly
courteous
greetings
yield
to
the
calm
and
composure
and
gentle
abstraction
that
reign
mild
monastic
faces
in
quiet
collegiate
cloisters
terrible
word
obligation
you
should
not
eustace
you
should
not
no
you
should
not
have
used
it
but
oh
great
heavens
i
repel
it
oh
i
cancel
reject
disavow
and
repudiate
wholly
every
debt
in
this
kind
disclaim
every
claim
and
dishonour
yea
my
own
heart
own
writing
my
soul
own
signature
ah
no
i
will
be
free
in
this
you
shall
not
none
shall
bind
me
no
my
friend
if
you
wish
to
be
told
it
was
this
above
all
things
this
that
charmed
me
ah
yes
even
this
that
she
held
me
to
nothing
no
i
could
talk
as
i
pleased
come
close
fasten
ties
as
i
fancied
bind
and
engage
myself
deep
and
lo
on
the
following
morning
it
was
all
as
before
like
losings
in
games
played
for
nothing
yes
when
i
came
with
mean
fears
in
my
soul
with
a
at
the
first
step
breaking
down
in
its
pitiful
role
of
evasion
when
to
shuffle
i
came
to
compromise
not
meet
engagements
lo
with
her
calm
eyes
there
she
met
me
and
knew
nothing
of
it
stood
unexpecting
unconscious
she
spoke
not
of
obligations
knew
not
of
debt
ah
no
i
believe
you
for
excellent
reasons
claude
to
eustace
hang
this
thinking
at
last
what
good
is
it
oh
and
what
evil
oh
what
mischief
and
pain
like
a
clock
in
a
sick
man
chamber
ticking
and
ticking
and
still
through
each
covert
of
slumber
pursuing
what
shall
i
do
to
thee
o
thou
preserver
of
men
have
compassion

favourable
and
hear
take
from
me
this
regal
knowledge
let
me
contented
and
mute

the
beasts
of
the

my
brothers
tranquilly
happily
lie

eat

mary
trevellyn
to
miss
roper
dear
miss
roper
it
seems
george
vernon
before
we
left
rome
said
something
to
claude
about
what
they
call
his
attentions
susan
two
nights
ago
for
the
first
time
heard
this
from
georgina
it
is
so
disagreeable
and
so
annoying
to
think
of
if
it
could
only
be
known
though
we
may
never
meet
him
again
that
it
was
all
george
doing
and
we
were
entirely
unconscious
it
would
extremely
relieve
your
ever
affectionate
mary
here
is
your
letter
arrived
this
moment
just
as
i
wanted
so
you
have
seen
him
indeed
and
guessed
how
dreadfully
clever
what
did
he
really
say
and
what
was
your
answer
exactly
charming
but
wait
for
a
moment
i
have
read
through
the
letter
ah
my
dearest
miss
roper
do
just
as
you
fancy
about
it
if
you
think
it
sincerer
to
tell
him
i
know
of
it
do
so
though
i
should
most
extremely
dislike
it
i
know
i
could
manage
it
is
the
simplest
thing
but
surely
wholly
uncalled
for
do
as
you
please
you
know
i
trust
implicitly
to
you
say
whatever
is
right
and
needful
for
ending
the
matter
only
do
tell
claude
what
i
will
tell
you
as
a
secret
that
i
should
like
very
well
to
show
him
myself
i
forget
it
i
am
to
say
that
the
wedding
is
finally
settled
for
tuesday
ah
my
dear
miss
roper
you
surely
surely
can
manage
not
to
let
it
appear
that
i
know
of
that
odious
matter
it
would
be
pleasanter
far
for
myself
to
treat
it
exactly
as
if
it
had
not
occurred
and
i
do
not
think
he
would
like
it
i
must
remember
to
add
that
as
soon
as
the
wedding
is
over
we
shall
be
off
i
believe
in
a
hurry
and
travel
to
milan
there
to
meet
friends
of
papa
i
am
told
at
the
croce
di
malta
then
i
can
not
say
whither
but
not
at
present
to
england
xiii
claude
to
eustace
yes
on
montorio
height
for
a
last
farewell
of
the
city
so
it
appears
though
then
i
was
quite
uncertain
about
it
so
however
it
was
and
now
to
explain
the
proceeding
i
was
to
go
as
i
told
you
i
think
with
the
people
to
florence
only
the
day
before
the
foolish
family
vernon
made
some
uneasy
remarks
as
we
walked
to
our
lodging
together
as
to
intentions
forsooth
and
so
forth
i
was
astounded
horrified
quite
and
obtaining
just
then
as
it
happened
an
offer
no
common
favour
of
seeing
the
great
ludovisi
collection
why
i
made
this
a
pretence
and
wrote
that
they
must
excuse
me
how
could
i
go
great
heavens
to
conduct
a
permitted
flirtation
under
those
vulgar
eyes
the
observed
of
such
observers
well
but
i
now
by
a
series
of
fine
diplomatic
inquiries
find
from
a
sort
of
relation
a
good
and
sensible
woman
who
is
remaining
at
rome
with
a
brother
too
ill
for
removal
that
it
was
wholly
unsanctioned
unknown
not
i
think
by
georgina
she
however
ere
this
and
that
is
the
best
of
the
story
she
and
the
vernon
thank
heaven
are
wedded
and
gone
so
on
montorio
height
for
a
last
farewell
of
the
city
tibur
i
have
not
seen
nor
the
lakes
that
of
old
i
had
dreamt
of
tibur
i
shall
not
see
nor
anio
waters
nor
deep
folded
in
sabine
recesses
the
valley
and
villa
of
horace
tibur
i
shall
not
see
but
something
better
i
shall
see
twice
i
have
tried
before
and
failed
in
getting
the
horses
twice
i
have
tried
and
failed
this
time
it
shall
not
be
a
failure
therefore
farewell
ye
hills
and
ye
ye
envineyarded
ruins
therefore
farewell
ye
walls
palaces
pillars
and
domes
therefore
farewell
far
seen
ye
peaks
of
the
mythic
albano
seen
from
montorio
height
tibur
and
aesula
hills
ah
could
we
once
ere
we
go
could
we
stand
while
to
ocean
descending
sinks
the
yellow
dark
plain
slowly
the
yellow
broad
sun
stand
from
the
forest
emerging
at
sunset
at
once
in
the
champaign
open
but
studded
with
trees
chestnuts
umbrageous
and
old
in
those
fair
open
fields
that
incurve
to
thy
beautiful
hollow
nemi
imbedded
in

nemi
inurned
in
the
hill
therefore
farewell
ye
plains
and
ye
hills
and
the
city
eternal
therefore
farewell
we
depart
but
to
behold
you
again
canto
iv
eastward
or
northward
or
west
i
wander
and
ask
as
i
wander
weary

sure
where
shall
i
come

my
love
whitherward
hasten

her
ye
daughters
of
italy
tell
me
graceful
and
tender
and
dark
is
she
consorting
with
you
thou
that
the
torrent
that
tendest
thy
goats
to
the
summit
call
to
me
child
of
the
alp
has
she
been
seen
on
the
heights
italy
farewell
i
bid
thee
for
whither
she
leads
me
i
follow
farewell
the
vineyard
for
i
where
i
but
guess
her
must
go
weariness
welcome
and
labour
wherever
it
be
if
at
last
it
bring
me
in
mountain
or
plain
into
the
sight
of
my
love
claude
to
eustace
from
florence
gone
from
florence
indeed
and
that
is
truly
provoking
gone
to
milan
it
seems
then
i
go
also
to
milan
five
days
now
departed
but
they
can
travel
but
slowly
i
quicker
far
and
i
know
as
it
happens
the
home
they
will
go
why
what
else
should
i
do
stay
here
and
look
at
the
pictures
statues
and
churches
alack
i
am
sick
of
the
statues
and
pictures
no
to
bologna
parma
piacenza
lodi
and
milan
off
go
we
and
the
venus
go
to
the
devil
ii
claude
to
eustace
from
bellaggio
gone
to
como
they
said
and
i
have
posted
to
como
there
was
a
letter
left
but
the
cameriere
had
lost
it
could
it
have
been
for
me
they
came
however
to
como
and
from
como
went
by
the
boat
perhaps
to
the
spluegen
or
to
the
stelvio
say
and
the
tyrol
also
it
might
be
by
porlezza
across
to
lugano
and
so
to
the
simplon
possibly
or
the
gothard
or
possibly
too
to
baveno
orta
turin
and
elsewhere
indeed
i
am
greatly
bewildered
iii
claude
to
eustace
from
bellaggio
i
have
been
up
the
spluegen
and
on
the
stelvio
also
neither
of
these
can
i
find
they
have
followed
in
no
one
inn
and
this
would
be
odd
have
they
written
their
names
i
have
been
to
porlezza
there
they
have
not
been
seen
and
therefore
not
at
lugano
what
shall
i
do
go
on
through
the
tyrol
switzerland
deutschland
seeking
an
inverse
saul
a
kingdom
to
find
only
asses
there
is
a
tide
at
least
in
the
love
affairs
of
mortals
which
when
taken
at
flood
leads
on
to
the
happiest
fortune
leads
to
the
and
the
and
the
altar
and
the
long
lawful
line
of
crowned
joys
to
crowned
joys
ah
it
has
ebbed
with
me
ye
gods
and
when
it
was
flowing
pitiful
fool
that
i
was
to
stand
in
that
way
iv
claude
to
eustace
from
bellaggio
i
have
returned
and
found
their
names
in
the
book
at
como
certain
it
is
i
was
right
and
yet
i
am
also
in
error
added
in
feminine
hand
i
read
by
the
boat
to
so
to
bellaggio
again
with
the
words
of
he
writing
to
aid
me
yet
at
bellaggio
i
find
no
trace
no
sort
of
remembrance
so
i
am
here
and
wait
and
know
every
hour
will
remove
them
claude
to
eustace
from
bellaggio
i
have
but
one
chance
left
and
that
is
going
to
florence
but
it
is
cruel
to
turn
the
mountains
seem
to
demand
me
peak
and
valley
from
far
to
beckon
and
motion
me
onward
somewhere
amid
their
folds
she
passes
whom
fain
i
would
follow
somewhere
amid
those
heights
she
haply
calls
me
to
seek
her
ah
could
i
hear
her
call
could
i
catch
the
glimpse
of
her
raiment
turn
however
i
must
though
it
seem
i
turn
to
desert
her
for
the
sense
of
the
thing
is
simply
to
hurry
to
florence
where
the
certainty
yet
may
be
learnt
i
suppose
from
the
ropers
vi
mary
trevellyn
from
lucerne
to
miss
roper
at
florence
dear
miss
roper
by
this
you
are
safely
away
we
are
hoping
many
a
league
from
rome
ere
long
we
trust
we
shall
see
you
how
have
you
travelled
i
wonder
was
claude
your
companion
as
for
ourselves
we
went
from
como
straight
to
lugano
so
by
the
mount
gothard
we
meant
to
go
by
porlezza
taking
the
steamer
and
stopping
as
you
had
advised
at
bellaggio
two
or
three
days
or
more
but
this
was
suddenly
altered
after
we
left
the
hotel
on
the
very
way
to
the
steamer
so
we
have
seen
i
fear
not
one
of
the
lakes
in
perfection
well
he
is
not
come
and
now
i
suppose
he
will
not
come
what
will
you
think
meantime
and
yet
i
must
really
confess
it
what
will
you
say
i
wrote
him
a
note
we
left
in
a
hurry
went
from
milan
to
como
three
days
before
we
expected
but
i
thought
if
he
came
all
the
way
to
milan
he
really
ought
not
to
be
disappointed
and
so
i
wrote
three
lines
to
say
i
had
heard
he
was
coming
desirous
of
joining
our
party
if
so
then
i
said
we
had
started
for
como
and
meant
to
cross
the
gothard
and
stay
we
believed
at
lucerne
for
the
summer
was
it
wrong
and
why
if
it
was
has
it
failed
to
bring
him
did
he
not
think
it
worth
while
to
come
to
milan
he
knew
you
told
him
the
house
we
should
go
to
or
may
it
perhaps
have
miscarried
any
way
now
i
repent
and
am
heartily
vexed
that
i
wrote
it
there
is
a
home
on
the
shore
of
the
alpine
sea
that
upswelling
high
up
the
spreads
in
the
hollow
between
wilderness
mountain
and
snow
from
the
land
of
the
olive
conceal
it
under
pilatus
hill
low
by
the
river
it
lies
italy
utter
the
word
and
the
olive
and
vine
will
allure
not
wilderness
forest
and
snow
will
not
the
passage
impede
italy
unto
thy
cities
receding
the
clue
to
recover
hither
recovered
the
clue
shall
not
the
traveller
haste
canto
there
is
a
city
upbuilt
on
the
quays
of
the
turbulent
arno
under
fiesole
heights
thither
are
we
to
return
there
is
a
city
that
fringes
the
curve
of
the
inflowing
waters
under
the
perilous
hill
fringes
the
beautiful
bay
parthenope
do
they
call
thee
the
siren
neapolis
seated
under
vesevus
hill
are
we
receding
to
thee
sicily
greece
will
invite
and
the
orient
or
are
we
turn
to
england
which
may
after
all
be
for
its
children
the
best
mary
trevellyn
at
lucerne
to
miss
roper
at
florence
so
you
are
really
free
and
living
in
quiet
at
florence
that
is
delightful
news
you
travelled
slowly
and
safely
claude
got
you
out
took
rooms
at
florence
before
you
wrote
from
milan
to
say
so
had
left
directly
for
milan
hoping
to
find
us
soon
if
he
could
he
would
you
are
dear
miss
roper
your
letter
has
made
me
exceedingly
happy
you
are
quite
sure
you
say
he
asked
you
about
our
intentions
you
had
not
heard
as
yet
of
lucerne
but
told
him
of
well
perhaps
he
will
come
however
i
will
not
expect
it
though
you
say
you
are
sure
if
he
can
he
will
you
are
certain
o
my
dear
many
thanks
from
your
ever
affectionate
mary
ii
claude
to
eustace
florence
action
will
furnish
belief
but
will
that
belief
be
the
true
one
this
is
the
point
you
know
however
it
does
much
matter
what
one
wants
i
suppose
is
to
predetermine
the
action
so
as
to
make
it
entail
not
a
chance
belief
but
the
true
one
out
of
the
question
you
say
if
a
thing
is
wrong
we
may
do
it
ah
but
this
wrong
you
see
but
i
do
not
know
that
it
matters
eustace
the
ropers
are
gone
and
no
one
can
tell
me
about
them
pisa
pisa
they
say
they
think
and
so
i
follow
to
pisa
hither
and
thither
inquiring
i
weary
of
making
inquiries
i
am
ashamed
i
declare
of
asking
people
about
who
are
your
friends
you
said
you
had
friends
who
would
certainly
know
them
florence
but
it
is
idle
moping
and
thinking
and
trying
to
fix
her
image
once
more
and
more
in
to
write
the
whole
perfect
inscription
over
and
over
again
upon
every
page
of
remembrance
i
have
settled
to
stay
at
florence
to
wait
for
your
answer
who
are
your
friends
write
quickly
and
tell
me
i
wait
for
your
answer
iii
mary
trevellyn
to
miss
at
lucca
baths
you
are
at
lucca
baths
you
tell
me
to
stay
for
the
summer
florence
was
quite
too
hot
you
ca
move
further
at
present
will
you
not
come
do
you
think
before
the
summer
is
over
got
you
out
with
very
considerable
trouble
and
he
was
useful
and
kind
and
seemed
so
happy
to
serve
you
did
stay
with
you
long
but
talked
very
openly
to
you
made
you
almost
his
confessor
without
appearing
to
know
it
what
about
and
you
say
you
did
need
his
confessions
o
my
dear
miss
roper
i
dare
not
trust
what
you
tell
me
will
he
come
do
you
think
i
am
really
so
sorry
for
him
they
did
give
him
my
letter
at
milan
i
feel
pretty
certain
you
had
told
him
bellaggio
we
did
go
to
bellaggio
so
he
would
miss
our
track
and
perhaps
never
come
to
lugano
where
we
were
written
in
full
to
lucerne
across
the
gothard
but
he
could
write
to
you
you
would
tell
him
where
you
were
going
iv
claude
to
eustace
let
me
then
bear
to
forget
her
i
will
not
cling
to
her
falsely
nothing
factitious
or
forced
shall
impair
the
old
happy
relation
i
will
let
myself
go
forget
not
try
to
remember
i
will
walk
on
my
way
accept
the
chances
that
meet
me
freely
encounter
the
world
imbibe
these
alien
airs
and
never
ask
if
new
feelings
and
thoughts
are
of
her
or
of
others
is
she
not
changing
herself
the
old
image
would
only
delude
me
i
will
be
bold
too
and
change
if
it
must
be
yet
if
in
all
things
yet
if
i
do
but
aspire
evermore
to
the
absolute
only
i
shall
be
doing
i
think
somehow
what
she
will
be
doing
i
shall
be
thine
o
my
child
some
way
though
i
know
not
in
what
way
let
me
submit
to
forget
her
i
must
i
already
forget
her
claude
to
eustace
utterly
vain
is
alas
this
attempt
at
the
absolute
wholly
i
who
believed
not
in
her
because
i
would
fain
believe
nothing
have
to
believe
as
i
may
with
a
wilful
unmeaning
acceptance
i
who
refused
to
enfasten
the
roots
of
my
floating
existence
in
the
rich
earth
cling
now
to
the
hard
naked
rock
that
is
left
me
ah
she
was
worthy
eustace
and
that
indeed
is
my
comfort
worthy
a
nobler
heart
than
a
fool
such
as
i
could
have
given
her
yes
it
relieves
me
to
write
though
i
do
not
send
and
the
chance
that
takes
may
destroy
my
fragments
but
as
men
pray
without
asking
whether
one
really
exist
to
hear
or
do
anything
for
them
simply
impelled
by
the
need
of
the
moment
to
turn
to
a
being
in
a
conception
of
whom
there
is
freedom
from
all
limitation
so
in
your
image
i
turn
to
an
ens
rationis
of
friendship
even
so
write
in
your
name
i
know
not
to
whom
nor
in
what
wise
there
was
a
time
methought
it
was
but
lately
departed
when
if
a
thing
was
denied
me
i
felt
i
was
bound
to
attempt
it
choice
alone
should
take
and
choice
alone
should
surrender
there
was
a
time
indeed
when
i
had
not
retired
thus
early
languidly
thus
from
pursuit
of
a
purpose
i
once
had
adopted
but
it
is
all
over
all
that
i
have
slunk
from
the
perilous
field
in
whose
wild
struggle
of
forces
the
prizes
of
life
are
contested
it
is
over
all
that
i
am
a
coward
and
know
it
courage
in
me
could
be
only
factitious
unnatural
useless
comfort
has
come
to
me
here
in
the
dreary
streets
of
the
city
comfort
how
do
you
think
with
a
to
bring
it
moping
along
the
streets
and
cursing
my
day
as
i
wandered
all
of
a
sudden
my
ear
met
the
sound
of
an
english
comfort
me
it
did
till
indeed
i
was
very
near
crying
ah
there
is
some
great
truth
partial
very
likely
but
needful
lodged
i
am
strangely
sure
in
the
tones
of
the
english
comfort
it
was
at
least
and
i
must
take
without
question
comfort
however
it
come
in
the
dreary
streets
of
the
city
what
with
trusting
myself
and
seeking
support
from
within
me
almost
i
could
believe
i
had
gained
a
religious
assurance
formed
in
my
own
poor
soul
a
great
moral
basis
to
rest
on
ah
but
indeed
i
see
i
feel
it
factitious
entirely
i
refuse
reject
and
put
it
utterly
from
me
i
will
look
straight
out
see
things
not
try
to
evade
them
fact
shall
be
fact
for
me
and
the
truth
the
truth
as
ever
flexible
changeable
vague
and
multiform
and
off
and
depart
to
the
void
thou
subtle
fanatical
tempter
i
shall
behold
thee
again
is
it
so
at
a
new
visitation
o
ill
genius
thou
i
shall
at
my
life
dissolution
when
the
pulses
are
weak
and
the
feeble
light
of
the
reason
flickers
an
unfed
flame
retiring
slow
from
the
socket
low
on
a
laid
hear
one
as
it
were
at
the
doorway
and
looking
up
see
thee
standing
by
looking
emptily
at
me
i
shall
entreat
thee
then
though
now
i
dare
to
refuse
thee
pale
and
pitiful
now
but
terrible
then
to
the
well
i
will
see
thee
again
and
while
i
can
will
repel
thee

healed

and

vii
mary
trevellyn
to
miss
roper
he
has
not
come
as
yet
and
now
i
must
not
expect
it
you
have
written
you
say
to
friends
at
florence
to
see
him
if
he
perhaps
should
return
but
that
is
surely
unlikely
has
he
not
written
to
you
he
did
not
know
your
direction
oh
how
strange
never
once
to
have
told
him
where
you
were
going
yet
if
he
only
wrote
to
florence
that
would
have
reached
you
if
what
you
say
he
said
was
true
why
has
he
not
done
so
is
he
gone
back
to
rome
do
you
think
to
his
vatican
marbles
o
my
dear
miss
roper
forgive
me
do
not
be
angry
you
have
written
to
florence
your
friends
would
certainly
find
him
might
you
not
write
to
him
but
yet
it
is
so
little
likely
i
shall
expect
nothing
ever
yours
your
affectionate

claude
to
eustace
i
can
not
stay
at
florence
not
even
to
wait
for
a
letter
galleries
only
oppress
me
remembrance
of
hope
i
had
cherished
almost
more
than
as
hope
when
i
passed
through
florence
the
first
time
lies
like
a
sword
in
my
soul
i
am
more
a
coward
than
ever
past
thought
the
caffes
and
waiters
distress
me
all
is
unkind
and
alas
i
am
ready
for
anyone
kindness
oh
i
knew
it
of
old
and
knew
it
i
thought
to
perfection
if
there
is
any
one
thing
in
the
world
to
preclude
all
kindness
it
is
the
need
of
it
it
is
this
sad
dependence
why
is
this
eustace
myself
were
i
stronger
i
think
i
could
tell
you
but
it
is
odd
when
it
comes
so
plumb
i
the
deeps
of
depression
daily
in
deeper
and
find
no
support
no
will
no
purpose
all
my
old
strengths
are
gone
and
yet
i
shall
have
to
do
something
ah
the
key
of
our
life
that
passes
all
wards
opens
all
locks
is
not
i
will
but
i
must
i
must
i
must
and
i
do
it
after
all
do
i
know
that
i
really
cared
so
about
her
do
whatever
i
will
i
can
not
call
up
her
image
for
when
i
close
my
eyes
i
see
very
likely
peter
or
the
pantheon
facade
or
michel
angelo
figures
or
at
a
wish
when
i
please
the
alban
hills
and
the
forum
but
that
face
those
eyes
ah
no
never
anything
like
them
only
try
as
i
will
a
sort
of
featureless
outline
and
a
pale
blank
orb
which
no
recollection
will
add
to
after
all
perhaps
there
was
something
factitious
about
it
i
have
had
pain
it
is
true
i
have
wept
and
so
have
the
actors
at
the
last
moment
i
have
your
letter
for
which
i
was
waiting
i
have
taken
my
place
and
see
no
good
in
inquiries
do
nothing
more
good
eustace
i
pray
you
it
only
will
vex
me
take
no
measures
indeed
should
we
meet
i
could
not
be
certain
all
might
be
changed
you
know
or
perhaps
there
was
nothing
to
be
changed
it
is
a
curious
history
this
and
yet
i
foresaw
it
i
could
have
told
it
before
the
fates
it
is
clear
are
against
us
for
it
is
certain
enough
i
met
with
the
people
you
mention
they
were
at
florence
the
day
i
returned
there
and
spoke
to
me
even
stayed
a
week
saw
me
often
departed
and
whither
i
know
not
great
is
fate
and
is
best
i
believe
in
providence
partly
what
is
ordained
is
right
and
all
that
happens
is
ordered
ah
no
that
is
it
but
yet
i
retain
my
conclusion
i
will
go
where
i
am
led
and
will
not
dictate
to
the
chances
do
nothing
more
i
beg
if
you
love
me
forbear
interfering
ix
claude
to
eustace
shall
we
come
out
of
it
all
some
day
as
one
does
from
a
tunnel
will
it
be
all
at
once
without
our
doing
or
asking
we
shall
behold
clear
day
the
trees
and
meadows
about
us
and
the
faces
of
friends
and
the
eyes
we
loved
looking
at
us
who
knows
who
can
say
it
will
not
do
to
suppose
it
claude
to
eustace
rome
rome
will
not
suit
me
eustace
the
priests
and
soldiers
possess
it
priests
and
soldiers
and
ah
which
is
the
worst
the
priest
or
the
soldier
politics
farewell
however
for
what
could
i
do
with
inquiring
talking
collating
the
journals
go
fever
my
brain
about
things
which
i
can
have
no
control
no
happen
whatever
may
happen
time
i
suppose
will
subsist
the
earth
will
revolve
on
its
axis
people
will
travel
the
stranger
will
wander
as
now
in
the
city
rome
will
be
here
and
the
pope
the
custode
of
vatican
marbles
i
have
no
heart
however
for
any
marble
or
fresco
i
have
essayed
it
in
vain
is
in
vain
as
yet
to
essay
it
but
i
may
haply
resume
some
day
my
studies
in
this
kind
not
as
the
scripture
says
is
i
think
the
fact
ere
our
faith
i
think
does
pass
and
love
but
knowledge
abideth
let
us
seek
knowledge
the
rest
may
come
and
go
as
it
happens
knowledge
is
hard
to
seek
and
harder
yet
to
adhere
to
knowledge
is
painful
often
and
yet
when
we
know
we
are
happy
seek
it
and
leave
mere
faith
and
love
to
come
with
the
chances
as
for
hope
i
hope
to
be
starting
for
naples
rome
will
not
do
i
see
for
many
very
good
reasons
eastward
then
i
suppose
with
the
coming
of
winter
to
egypt
xi
mary
trevellyn
to
miss
roper
you
have
heard
nothing
of
course
i
know
you
can
have
heard
nothing
ah
well
more
than
once
i
have
broken
my
purpose
and
sometimes
only
too
often
have
looked
for
the
little
lake
steamer
to
bring
him
but
it
is
only
fancy
i
do
not
really
expect
it
oh
and
you
see
i
know
so
exactly
how
he
would
take
it
finding
the
chances
prevail
against
meeting
again
he
would
banish
forthwith
every
thought
of
the
poor
little
possible
hope
which
i
myself
could
not
help
perhaps
thinking
only
too
much
of
he
would
resign
himself
and
go
i
see
it
exactly
so
i
also
submit
although
in
a
different
manner
can
you
not
really
come
we
go
very
shortly
to
england
so
go
forth
to
the
world
to
the
good
report
and
the
evil
go
little
book
thy
tale
is
it
not
evil
and
good
go
and
if
strangers
revile
pass
quietly
by
without
answer
go
and
if
curious
friends
ask
of
thy
rearing
and
age
say
am
flitting
about
many
years
from
brain
unto
brain
of
feeble
and
restless
youths
born
to
inglorious
days
but
so
finish
the
word

writ
in
a
roman
chamber
when
from
janiculan
heights
thundered
the
cannon

france
