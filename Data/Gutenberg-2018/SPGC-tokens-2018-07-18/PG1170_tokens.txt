i
darius
and
parysatis
had
two
sons
the
elder
was
named
artaxerxes
and
the
younger
cyrus
now
as
darius
lay
sick
and
felt
that
the
end
of
life
drew
near
he
wished
both
his
sons
to
be
with
him
the
elder
as
it
chanced
was
already
there
but
cyrus
he
must
needs
send
for
from
the
province
over
which
he
had
made
him
satrap
having
appointed
him
general
moreover
of
all
the
forces
that
muster
in
the
plain
of
the
castolus
thus
cyrus
went
up
taking
with
him
tissaphernes
as
his
friend
and
accompanied
also
by
a
body
of
hellenes
three
hundred
heavy
armed
men
under
the
command
of
xenias
the
parrhasian
parrhasia
a
district
and
town
in
the
of
arcadia
now
when
darius
was
dead
and
artaxerxes
was
established
in
the
kingdom
tissaphernes
brought
slanderous
accusations
against
cyrus
before
his
brother
the
king
of
harbouring
designs
against
him
and
artaxerxes
listening
to
the
words
of
tissaphernes
laid
hands
upon
cyrus
desiring
to
put
him
to
death
but
his
mother
made
intercession
for
him
and
sent
him
back
again
in
safety
to
his
province
he
then
having
so
escaped
through
peril
and
dishonour
fell
to
considering
not
only
how
he
might
avoid
ever
again
being
in
his
brother
power
but
how
if
possible
he
might
become
king
in
his
stead
parysatis
his
mother
was
his
first
resource
for
she
had
more
love
for
cyrus
than
for
artaxerxes
upon
his
throne
moreover
cyrus
behaviour
towards
all
who
came
to
him
from
the
king
court
was
such
that
when
he
sent
them
away
again
they
were
better
friends
to
himself
than
to
the
king
his
brother
nor
did
he
neglect
the
barbarians
in
his
own
service
but
trained
them
at
once
to
be
capable
as
warriors
and
devoted
adherents
of
himself
lastly
he
began
collecting
his
hellenic
armament
but
with
the
utmost
secrecy
so
that
he
might
take
the
king
as
far
as
might
be
at
unawares
the
manner
in
which
he
contrived
the
levying
of
the
troops
was
as
follows
first
he
sent
orders
to
the
commandants
of
garrisons
in
the
cities
so
held
by
him
bidding
them
to
get
together
as
large
a
body
of
picked
peloponnesian
troops
as
they
severally
were
able
on
the
plea
that
tissaphernes
was
plotting
against
their
cities
and
truly
these
cities
of
ionia
had
originally
belonged
to
tissaphernes
being
given
to
him
by
the
king
but
at
this
time
with
the
exception
of
miletus
they
had
all
revolted
to
cyrus
in
miletus
tissaphernes
having
become
aware
of
similar
designs
had
forestalled
the
conspirators
by
putting
some
to
death
and
banishing
the
remainder
cyrus
on
his
side
welcomed
these
fugitives
and
having
collected
an
army
laid
siege
to
miletus
by
sea
and
land
endeavouring
to
reinstate
the
exiles
and
this
gave
him
another
pretext
for
collecting
an
armament
at
the
same
time
he
sent
to
the
king
and
claimed
as
being
the
king
brother
that
these
cities
should
be
given
to
himself
rather
than
that
tissaphernes
should
continue
to
govern
them
and
in
furtherance
of
this
end
the
queen
his
mother
with
him
so
that
the
king
not
only
failed
to
see
the
design
against
himself
but
concluded
that
cyrus
was
spending
his
money
on
armaments
in
order
to
make
war
on
tissaphernes
nor
did
it
pain
him
greatly
to
see
the
two
at
war
together
and
the
less
so
because
cyrus
was
careful
to
remit
the
tribute
due
to
the
king
from
the
cities
which
belonged
to
tissaphernes
a
third
army
was
being
collected
for
him
in
the
chersonese
over
against
abydos
the
origin
of
which
was
as
follows
there
was
a
lacedaemonian
exile
named
clearchus
with
whom
cyrus
had
become
associated
cyrus
admired
the
man
and
made
him
a
present
of
ten
thousand
darics
clearchus
took
the
gold
and
with
the
money
raised
an
army
and
using
the
chersonese
as
his
base
of
operations
set
to
work
to
fight
the
thracians
north
of
the
hellespont
in
the
interests
of
the
hellenes
and
with
such
happy
result
that
the
hellespontine
cities
of
their
own
accord
were
eager
to
contribute
funds
for
the
support
of
his
troops
in
this
way
again
an
armament
was
being
secretly
maintained
for
cyrus
a
persian
gold
coin
grains
of
gold
then
there
was
the
thessalian
aristippus
cyrus
friend
who
under
pressure
of
the
rival
political
party
at
home
had
come
to
cyrus
and
asked
him
for
pay
for
two
thousand
mercenaries
to
be
continued
for
three
months
which
would
enable
him
he
said
to
gain
the
upper
hand
of
his
antagonists
cyrus
replied
by
presenting
him
with
six
months
pay
for
four
thousand
mercenaries
only
stipulating
that
aristippus
should
not
come
to
terms
with
his
antagonists
without
final
consultation
with
himself
in
this
way
he
secured
to
himself
the
secret
maintenance
of
a
fourth
armament
lit
aristippus
was
as
we
learn
from
the
meno
of
plato
a
native
of
larisa
of
the
family
of
the
aleuadae
and
a
pupil
of
gorgias
he
was
also
a
lover
of
menon
whom
he
appears
to
have
sent
on
this
expedition
instead
of
himself
further
he
bade
proxenus
a
boeotian
who
was
another
friend
get
together
as
many
men
as
possible
and
join
him
in
an
expedition
which
he
meditated
against
the
pisidians
who
were
causing
annoyance
to
his
territory
similarly
two
other
friends
sophaenetus
the
stymphalian
and
socrates
the
achaean
had
orders
to
get
together
as
many
men
as
possible
and
come
to
him
since
he
was
on
the
point
of
opening
a
campaign
along
with
milesian
exiles
against
tissaphernes
these
orders
were
duly
carried
out
by
the
officers
in
question
lit
into
the
country
of
the
pisidians
of
stymphalus
in
arcadia
ii
but
when
the
right
moment
seemed
to
him
to
have
come
at
which
he
should
begin
his
march
into
the
interior
the
pretext
which
he
put
forward
was
his
desire
to
expel
the
pisidians
utterly
out
of
the
country
and
he
began
collecting
both
his
asiatic
and
his
hellenic
armaments
avowedly
against
that
people
from
sardis
in
each
direction
his
orders
sped
to
clearchus
to
join
him
there
with
the
whole
of
his
army
to
aristippus
to
come
to
terms
with
those
at
home
and
to
despatch
to
him
the
troops
in
his
employ
to
xenias
the
arcadian
who
was
acting
as
of
the
foreign
troops
in
the
cities
to
present
himself
with
all
the
men
available
excepting
only
those
who
were
actually
needed
to
garrison
the
citadels
he
next
summoned
the
troops
at
present
engaged
in
the
siege
of
miletus
and
called
upon
the
exiles
to
follow
him
on
his
intended
expedition
promising
them
that
if
he
were
successful
in
his
object
he
would
not
pause
until
he
had
reinstated
them
in
their
native
city
to
this
invitation
they
hearkened
gladly
they
believed
in
him
and
with
their
arms
they
presented
themselves
at
sardis
so
too
xenias
arrived
at
sardis
with
the
contingent
from
the
cities
four
thousand
hoplites
proxenus
also
with
fifteen
hundred
hoplites
and
five
hundred
troops
sophaenetus
the
stymphalian
with
one
thousand
hoplites
socrates
the
achaean
with
five
hundred
hoplites
while
the
megarion
pasion
came
with
three
hundred
hoplites
and
three
hundred
peltasts
this
latter
officer
as
well
as
socrates
belonged
to
the
force
engaged
against
miletus
these
all
joined
him
at
sardis
targeteers
armed
with
a
light
shield
instead
of
the
larger
one
of
the
hoplite
or
heavy
infantry
soldier
iphicrates
made
great
use
of
this
arm
at
a
later
date
but
tissaphernes
did
not
fail
to
note
these
proceedings
an
equipment
so
large
pointed
to
something
more
than
an
invasion
of
pisidia
so
he
argued
and
with
what
speed
he
might
he
set
off
to
the
king
attended
by
about
five
hundred
horse
the
king
on
his
side
had
no
sooner
heard
from
tissaphernes
of
cyrus
great
armament
than
he
began
to
make
thus
cyrus
with
the
troops
which
i
have
named
set
out
from
sardis
and
marched
on
and
on
through
lydia
three
stages
making
parasangs
to
the
river
maeander
that
river
is
two
hundred
feet
broad
and
was
spanned
by
a
bridge
consisting
of
seven
boats
crossing
it
he
marched
through
phrygia
a
single
stage
of
eight
parasangs
to
colossae
an
inhabited
city
prosperous
and
large
here
he
remained
seven
days
and
was
joined
by
menon
the
thessalian
who
arrived
with
one
thousand
hoplites
and
five
hundred
peltasts
dolopes
aenianes
and
olynthians
from
this
place
he
marched
three
stages
twenty
parasangs
in
all
to
celaenae
a
populous
city
of
phrygia
large
and
prosperous
here
cyrus
owned
a
palace
and
a
large
park
full
of
wild
beasts
which
he
used
to
hunt
on
horseback
whenever
he
wished
to
give
himself
or
his
horses
exercise
through
the
midst
of
the
park
flows
the
river
maeander
the
sources
of
which
are
within
the
palace
buildings
and
it
flows
through
the
city
of
celaenae
the
great
king
also
has
a
palace
in
celaenae
a
strong
place
on
the
sources
of
another
river
the
marsyas
at
the
foot
of
the
acropolis
this
river
also
flows
through
the
city
discharging
itself
into
the
maeander
and
is
feet
broad
here
is
the
place
where
apollo
is
said
to
have
flayed
marsyas
when
he
had
conquered
him
in
the
contest
of
skill
he
hung
up
the
skin
of
the
conquered
man
in
the
cavern
where
the
spring
wells
forth
and
hence
the
name
of
the
river
marsyas
it
was
on
this
site
that
xerxes
as
tradition
tells
built
this
very
palace
as
well
as
the
citadel
of
celaenae
itself
on
his
retreat
from
hellas
after
he
had
lost
the
famous
battle
here
cyrus
remained
for
thirty
days
during
which
clearchus
the
lacedaemonian
arrived
with
one
thousand
hoplites
and
eight
hundred
thracian
peltasts
and
two
hundred
cretan
archers
at
the
same
time
also
came
sosis
the
syracusian
with
three
thousand
hoplites
and
sophaenetus
the
arcadian
with
one
thousand
hoplites
and
here
cyrus
held
a
review
and
numbered
his
hellenes
in
the
park
and
found
that
they
amounted
in
all
to
eleven
thousand
hoplites
and
about
two
thousand
peltasts

perhaps
this

sophaenetus
has
already
been
named
above
from
this
place
he
continued
his
march
two
stages
ten
parasangs
to
the
populous
city
of
peltae
where
he
remained
three
days
while
xenias
the
arcadian
celebrated
the
lycaea
with
sacrifice
and
instituted
games
the
prizes
were
headbands
of
gold
and
cyrus
himself
was
a
spectator
of
the
contest
from
this
place
the
march
was
continued
two
stages
twelve
parasangs
to
a
populous
city
the
last
on
the
confines
of
mysia
thence
a
march
of
three
stages
thirty
parasangs
brought
him
to
a
populous
city
here
cyrus
halted
five
days
and
the
soldiers
whose
pay
was
now
more
than
three
months
in
arrear
came
several
times
to
the
palace
gates
demanding
their
dues
while
cyrus
put
them
off
with
fine
words
and
expectations
but
could
not
conceal
his
vexation
for
it
was
not
his
fashion
to
stint
payment
when
he
had
the
means
at
this
point
epyaxa
the
wife
of
syennesis
the
king
of
the
cilicians
arrived
on
a
visit
to
cyrus
and
it
was
said
that
cyrus
received
a
large
gift
of
money
from
the
queen
at
this
date
at
any
rate
cyrus
gave
the
army
four
months
pay
the
queen
was
accompanied
by
a
bodyguard
of
cilicians
and
aspendians
and
if
report
speaks
truly
cyrus
had
intimate
relations
with
the
queen
the
lycaea
an
arcadian
festival
in
honour
of
zeus
arcaios
akin
to
the
roman
lupercalia
which
was
originally
a
shepherd
festival
the
introduction
of
which
the
romans
ascribe
to
the
arcadian
evander
lit
plain
of
the
cayster
like
the
market
of
the
ceramians
above
the
name
of
a

from
this
place
he
marched
two
stages
ten
parasangs
to
thymbrium
a
populous
city
here
by
the
side
of
the
road
is
the
spring
of
midas
the
king
of
phrygia
as
it
is
called
where
midas
as
the
story
goes
caught
the
satyr
by
drugging
the
spring
with
wine
from
this
place
he
marched
two
stages
ten
parasangs
to
tyriaeum
a
populous
city
here
he
halted
three
days
and
the
cilician
queen
according
to
the
popular
account
begged
cyrus
to
exhibit
his
armament
for
her
amusement
the
latter
being
only
too
glad
to
make
such
an
exhibition
held
a
review
of
the
hellenes
and
barbarians
in
the
plain
he
ordered
the
hellenes
to
draw
up
their
lines
and
post
themselves
in
their
customary
battle
order
each
general
marshalling
his
own
battalion
accordingly
they
drew

remaining

with
theirs
cyrus
first
inspected
the
barbarians
who
marched
past
in
troops
of
horses
and
companies
of
infantry
he
then
inspected
the
hellenes
driving
past
them
in
his
chariot
with
the
queen
in
her
carriage
and
they
all
had
brass
helmets
and
purple
tunics
and
greaves
and
their
shields
uncovered
ready
for
action
bayonets
fixed
after
he
had
driven
past
the
whole
body
he
drew
up
his
chariot
in
front
of
the
centre
of
the
and
sent
his
interpreter
pigres
to
the
generals
of
the
hellenes
with
orders
to
present
arms
and
to
advance
along
the
whole
line
this
order
was
repeated
by
the
generals
to
their
men
and
at
the
sound
of
the
bugle
with
shields
forward
and
spears
in
rest
they
advanced
to
meet
the
enemy
the
pace
quickened
and
with
a
shout
the
soldiers
spontaneously
fell
into
a
run
making
in
the
direction
of
the
camp
great
was
the
panic
of
the
barbarians
the
cilician
queen
in
her
carriage
turned
and
fled
the
sutlers
in
the
marketing
place
left
their
wares
and
took
to
their
heels
and
the
hellenes
meanwhile
came
into
camp
with
a
roar
of
laughter
what
astounded
the
queen
was
the
brilliancy
and
order
of
the
armament
but
cyrus
was
pleased
to
see
the
terror
inspired
by
the
hellenes
in
the
hearts
of
the
asiatics
from
this
place
he
marched
on
three
stages
twenty
parasangs
to
iconium
the
last
city
of
phrygia
where
he
remained
three
days
thence
he
marched
through
lycaonia
five
stages
thirty
parasangs
this
was
hostile
country
and
he
gave
it
over
to
the
hellenes
to
pillage
at
this
point
cyrus
sent
back
the
cilician
queen
to
her
own
country
by
the
quickest
route
and
to
escort
her
he
sent
the
soldiers
of
menon
and
menon
himself
with
the
rest
of
the
troops
he
continued
his
march
through
cappadocia
four
stages
parasangs
to
dana
a
populous
city
large
and
flourishing
here
they
halted
three
days
within
which
interval
cyrus
put
to
death
on
a
charge
of
conspiracy
a
persian
nobleman
named
megaphernes
a
wearer
of
the
royal
purple
and
along
with
him
another
high
dignitary
among
his
subordinate
commanders
from
this
place
they
endeavoured
to
force
a
passage
into
cilicia
now
the
entrance
was
by
an
exceedingly
steep
impracticable
for
an
army
in
face
of
a
resisting
force
and
report
said
that
syennesis
was
on
the
summit
of
the
pass
guarding
the
approach
accordingly
they
halted
a
day
in
the
plain
but
next
day
came
a
messenger
informing
them
that
syenesis
had
left
the
pass
doubtless
after
perceiving
that
menon
army
was
already
in
cilicia
on
his
own
side
of
the
mountains
and
he
had
further
been
informed
that
ships
of
war
belonging
to
the
lacedaemonians
and
to
cyrus
himself
with
tamos
on
board
as
admiral
were
sailing
round
from
ionia
to
cilicia
whatever
the
reason
might
be
cyrus
made
his
way
up
into
the
hills
without
let
or
hindrance
and
came
in
sight
of
the
tents
where
the
cilicians
were
on
guard
from
that
point
he
descended
gradually
into
a
large
and
beautiful
plain
country
well
watered
and
thickly
covered
with
trees
of
all
sorts
and
vines
this
plain
produces
sesame
plentifully
as
also
panic
and
millet
and
barley
and
wheat
and
it
is
shut
in
on
all
sides
by
a
steep
and
lofty
wall
of
mountains
from
sea
to
sea
descending
through
this
plain
country
he
advanced
four
stages
parasangs
to
tarsus
a
large
and
prosperous
city
of
cilicia
here
stood
the
palace
of
syennesis
the
king
of
the
country
and
through
the
middle
of
the
city
flows
a
river
called
the
cydnus
two
hundred
feet
broad
they
found
that
the
city
had
been
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
who
had
betaken
themselves
with
syennesis
to
a
strong
place
on
the
hills
all
had
gone
except
the
the
inhabitants
of
soli
and
issi
also
remained
now
epyaxa
syennesis
queen
had
reached
tarsus
five
days
in
advance
of
cyrus
during
their
passage
over
the
mountains
into
the
plain
two
companies
of
menon
army
were
lost
some
said
they
had
been
cut
down
by
the
cilicians
while
engaged
on
some
pillaging
affair
another
account
was
that
they
had
been
left
behind
and
being
unable
to
overtake
the
main
body
or
discover
the
route
had
gone
astray
and
perished
however
it
was
they
numbered
one
hundred
hoplites
and
when
the
rest
arrived
being
in
a
fury
at
the
destruction
of
their
fellow
soldiers
they
vented
their
spleen
by
pillaging
the
city
of
tarsus
and
the
palace
to
boot
now
when
cyrus
had
marched
into
the
city
he
sent
for
syennesis
to
come
to
him
but
the
latter
replied
that
he
had
never
yet
put
himself
into
the
hands
of
any
one
who
was
his
superior
nor
was
he
willing
to
accede
to
the
proposal
of
cyrus
now
until
in
the
end
his
wife
persuaded
him
and
he
accepted
pledges
of
good
faith
after
this
they
met
and
syennesis
gave
cyrus
large
sums
in
aid
of
his
army
while
cyrus
presented
him
with
the
customary
royal
gifts
to
wit
a
horse
with
a
gold
bit
a
necklace
of
gold
a
gold
bracelet
and
a
gold
scimitar
a
persian
dress
and
lastly
the
exemption
of
his
territory
from
further
pillage
with
the
privilege
of
taking
back
the
slaves
that
had
been
seized
wherever
they
might
chance
to
come
upon
them
iii
at
tarsus
cyrus
and
his
army
halted
for
twenty
days
the
soldiers
refusing
to
advance
further
since
the
suspicion
ripened
in
their
minds
that
the
expedition
was
in
reality
directed
against
the
king
and
as
they
insisted
they
had
not
engaged
their
services
for
that
object
clearchus
set
the
example
of
trying
to
force
his
men
to
continue
their
march
but
he
had
no
sooner
started
at
the
head
of
his
troops
than
they
began
to
pelt
him
and
his
baggage
train
and
clearchus
had
a
narrow
escape
of
being
stoned
to
death
there
and
then
later
on
when
he
perceived
that
force
was
useless
he
summoned
an
assembly
of
his
own
men
and
for
a
long
while
he
stood
and
wept
while
the
men
gazed
in
silent
astonishment
at
last
he
spoke
as
follows
fellow
soldiers
do
not
marvel
that
i
am
sorely
distressed
on
account
of
the
present
troubles
cyrus
has
been
no
ordinary
friend
to
me
when
i
was
in
banishment
he
honoured
me
in
various
ways
and
made
me
also
a
present
of
ten
thousand
darics
these
i
accepted
but
not
to
lay
them
up
for
myself
for
private
use
not
to
squander
them
in
pleasure
but
to
expend
them
on
yourselves
and
first
of
all
i
went
to
war
with
the
thracians
and
with
you
to
aid
i
wreaked
vengeance
on
them
in
behalf
of
hellas
driving
them
out
of
the
chersonese
when
they
wanted
to
deprive
its
hellenic
inhabitants
of
their
lands
but
as
soon
as
cyrus
summoned
me
i
took
you
with
me
and
set
out
so
that
if
my
benefactor
had
any
need
of
me
i
might
requite
him
for
the
good
treatment
i
myself
had
received
at
his
hands
but
since
you
are
not
minded
to
continue
the
march
with
me
one
of
two
things
is
left
to
me
to
do
either
i
must
renounce
you
for
the
sake
of
my
friendship
with
cyrus
or
i
must
go
with
you
at
the
cost
of
deceiving
him
whether
i
am
about
to
do
right
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
i
choose
yourselves
and
whatever
betide
i
mean
to
share
your
fate
never
shall
it
be
said
of
me
by
any
one
that
having
led
greek
troops
against
the
barbarians
i
betrayed
the
hellenes
and
chose
the
friendship
of
the
barbarian
no
since
you
do
not
choose
to
obey
and
follow
me
i
will
follow
after
you
whatever
betide
i
will
share
your
fate
i
look
upon
you
as
my
country
my
friends
my
allies
with
you
i
think
i
shall
be
honoured
wherever
i
be
without
you
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
help
a
friend
or
hurt
a
foe
my
decision
is
taken
wherever
you
go
i
go
also
lit
into
the
country
of
the
barbarian
such
were
his
words
but
the
soldiers
not
only
his
own
but
the
rest
also
when
they
heard
what
he
said
and
how
he
had
scouted
the
idea
of
going
up
to
the
great
king
palace
expressed
their
approval
and
more
than
two
thousand
men
deserted
xenias
and
pasion
and
took
their
arms
and
and
came
and
encamped
with
clearchus
but
cyrus
in
despair
and
vexation
at
this
turn
of
affairs
sent
for
clearchus
he
refused
to
come
but
without
the
knowledge
of
the
soldiers
sent
a
message
to
cyrus
bidding
him
keep
a
good
heart
for
that
all
would
arrange
itself
in
the
right
way
and
bade
him
keep
on
sending
for
him
whilst
he
himself
refused
to
go
after
that
he
got
together
his
own
men
with
those
who
had
joined
him
and
of
the
rest
any
who
chose
to
come
and
spoke
as
follows
fellow
soldiers
it
is
clear
that
the
relations
of
cyrus
to
us
are
identical
with
ours
to
him
we
are
no
longer
his
soldiers
since
we
have
ceased
to
follow
him
and
he
on
his
side
is
no
longer
our
paymaster
he
however
no
doubt
considers
himself
wronged
by
us
and
though
he
goes
on
sending
for
me
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
go
to
him
for
two
reasons
chiefly
from
a
sense
of
shame
for
i
am
forced
to
admit
to
myself
that
i
have
altogether
deceived
him
but
partly
too
because
i
am
afraid
of
his
seizing
me
and
inflicting
a
penalty
on
the
wrongs
which
he
conceives
that
i
have
done
him
in
my
opinion
then
this
is
no
time
for
us
to
go
to
sleep
and
forget
all
about
ourselves
rather
it
is
high
time
to
deliberate
on
our
next
move
and
as
long
as
we
do
remain
here
we
had
better
bethink
us
how
we
are
to
abide
in
security
or
if
we
are
resolved
to
turn
our
backs
at
once
what
will
be
the
safest
means
of
retreat
and
further
how
we
are
to
procure
supplies
for
without
supplies
there
is
no
profit
whatsoever
in
the
general
or
the
private
soldier
the
man
with
whom
we
have
to
deal
is
an
excellent
friend
to
his
friends
but
a
very
dangerous
enemy
to
his
foes
and
he
is
backed
by
a
force
of
infantry
and
cavalry
and
ships
such
as
we
all
alike
very
well
see
and
know
since
we
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
posted
ourselves
at
any
great
distance
from
him
if
then
any
one
has
a
suggestion
to
make
now
is
the
time
to
speak
with
these
words
he
ceased
or
how
he
insisted
that
he
was
not
going
up
then
various
speakers
stood
up
some
of
their
own
motion
to
propound
their
views
others
inspired
by
clearchus
to
dilate
on
the
hopeless
difficulty
of
either
staying
or
going
back
without
the
goodwill
of
cyrus
one
of
these
in
particular
with
a
of
anxiety
to
commence
the
homeward
march
without
further
pause
called
upon
them
instantly
to
choose
other
generals
if
clearchus
were
not
himself
prepared
to
lead
them
back
let
them
at
once
purchase
supplies
the
market
being
in
the
heart
of
the
asiatic
camp
let
them
pack
up
their
baggage
let
them
he
added
go
to
cyrus
and
ask
for
some
ships
in
order
to
return
by
sea
if
he
refused
to
give
them
ships
let
them
demand
of
him
a
guide
to
lead
them
back
through
a
friendly
district
and
if
he
would
not
so
much
as
give
them
a
guide
they
could
but
put
themselves
without
more
ado
in
marching
order
and
send
on
a
detachment
to
occupy
the
pass
before
cyrus
and
the
cilicians
whose
property
the
speaker
added
we
have
so
plentifully
pillaged
can
anticipate
us
such
were
the
remarks
of
that
speaker
he
was
followed
by
clearchus
who
merely
said
as
to
my
acting
personally
as
general
at
this
season
pray
do
not
propose
it
i
can
see
numerous
obstacles
to
my
doing
so
obedience
in
the
fullest
i
can
render
to
the
man
of
your
choice
that
is
another
matter
and
you
shall
see
and
know
that
i
can
play
my
part
under
command
with
the
best
of
you
after
clearchus
another
spokesman
stood
up
and
proceeded
to
point
out
the
simplicity
of
the
speaker
who
proposed
to
ask
for
vessels
just
as
if
cyrus
were
minded
to
renounce
the
expedition
and
sail
back
again
and
let
me
further
point
out
he
said
what
a
notion
it
is
to
beg
a
guide
of
the
very
man
whose
designs
we
are
marring
if
we
can
trust
any
guide
whom
cyrus
may
vouchsafe
to
us
why
not
order
cyrus
at
once
to
occupy
the
pass
on
our
behoof
for
my
part
i
should
think
twice
before
i
set
foot
on
any
ships
that
he
might
give
us
for
fear
lest
he
should
sink
them
with
his
and
i
should
equally
hesitate
to
follow
any
guide
of
his
he
might
lead
us
into
some
place
out
of
which
we
should
find
it
impossible
to
escape
i
should
much
prefer
if
i
am
to
return
home
against
the
will
of
cyrus
at
all
to
give
him
the
slip
and
so
begone
which
indeed
is
impossible
but
these
schemes
are
simply
nonsensical
my
proposal
is
that
a
deputation
of
fit
persons
with
clearchus
should
go
to
cyrus
let
them
go
to
cyrus
and
ask
him
what
use
he
proposes
to
make
of
us
and
if
the
business
is
at
all
similar
to
that
on
which
he
once
before
employed
a
body
of
foreigners
let
us
by
all
means
follow
let
us
show
that
we
are
the
equals
of
those
who
accompanied
him
on
his
much
up
formerly
but
if
the
design
should
turn
out
to
be
of
larger
import
than
the
former
one
involving
more
toil
and
more
danger
we
should
ask
him
either
to
give
us
good
reasons
for
following
his
lead
or
else
consent
to
send
us
away
into
a
friendly
country
in
this
way
whether
we
follow
him
we
shall
do
so
as
friends
and
with
heart
and
soul
or
whether
we
go
back
we
shall
do
so
in
security
the
answer
to
this
shall
be
reported
to
us
here
and
when
we
have
heard
it
we
will
advise
as
to
our
best
course
this
resolution
was
carried
and
they
chose
and
sent
a
deputation
with
clearchus
who
put
to
cyrus
the
questions
which
had
been
agreed
upon
by
the
army
cyrus
replied
as
follows
that
he
had
received
news
that
abrocomas
an
enemy
of
his
was
posted
on
the
euphrates
twelve
stages
off
his
object
was
to
march
against
this
aforesaid
abrocomas
and
if
he
were
still
there
he
wished
to
inflict
punishment
on
him
or
if
he
be
fled
so
the
reply
concluded
we
will
there
deliberate
on
the
best
course
the
deputation
received
the
answer
and
reported
it
to
the
soldiers
the
suspicion
that
he
was
leading
them
against
the
king
was
not
dispelled
but
it
seemed
best
to
follow
him
they
only
demanded
an
increase
of
pay
and
cyrus
promised
to
give
them
half
as
much
again
as
they
had
hitherto
received
that
is
to
say
a
daric
and
a
half
a
month
to
each
man
instead
of
a
daric
was
he
really
leading
them
to
attack
the
king
not
even
at
this
moment
was
any
one
apprised
of
the
fact
at
any
rate
in
any
open
and
public
manner
iv
from
this
point
he
marched
two
stages
ten
parasangs
to
the
river
psarus
which
is
two
hundred
feet
broad
and
from
the
psarus
he
marched
a
single
stage
five
parasangs
to
issi
the
last
city
in
cilicia
it
lies
on
the
seaboard
a
prosperous
large
and
flourishing
town
here
they
halted
three
days
and
here
cyrus
was
joined
by
his
fleet
there
were
ships
from
peloponnesus
with
the
lacedaemonian
admiral
pythagoras
on
board
these
had
been
piloted
from
ephesus
by
tamos
the
egyptian
who
himself
had
another
fleet
of
ships
belonging
to
cyrus
these
had
formed
blockading
squadron
at
miletus
when
that
city
sided
with
tissaphernes
he
had
also
used
them
in
other
military
services
rendered
to
cyrus
in
his
operations
against
that
satrap
there
was
a
third
officer
on
board
the
fleet
the
lacedaemonian
cheirisophus
who
had
been
sent
for
by
cyrus
and
had
brought
with
him
seven
hundred
hoplites
over
whom
he
was
to
act
as
general
in
the
service
of
cyrus
the
fleet
lay
at
anchor
opposite
cyrus
tent
here
too
another
reinforcement
presented
itself
this
was
a
body
of
four
hundred
hoplites
hellenic
mercenaries
in
the
service
of
abrocomas
who
deserted
him
for
cyrus
and
joined
in
the
campaign
against
the
king
from
issi
he
marched
a
single
stage
five
parasangs
to
the
gates
of
cilicia
and
syria
this
was
a
double
fortress
the
inner
and
nearer
one
which
protects
cilicia
was
held
by
syennesis
and
a
garrison
of
cilicians
the
outer
and
further
one
protecting
syria
was
reported
to
be
garrisoned
by
a
body
of
the
king
troops
through
the
gap
between
the
two
fortresses
flows
a
river
named
the
carsus
which
is
a
hundred
feet
broad
and
the
whole
space
between
was
scarcely
more
than
six
hundred
yards
to
force
a
passage
here
would
be
impossible
so
narrow
was
the
pass
itself
with
the
fortification
walls
stretching
down
to
the
sea
and
precipitous
rocks
above
while
both
fortresses
were
furnished
with
gates
it
was
the
existence
of
this
pass
which
had
induced
cyrus
to
send
for
the
fleet
so
as
to
enable
him
to
lead
a
body
of
hoplites
inside
and
outside
the
gates
and
so
to
force
a
passage
through
the
enemy
if
he
were
guarding
the
syrian
gate
as
he
fully
expected
to
find
abrocomas
doing
with
a
large
army
this
however
abrocomas
had
not
done
but
as
soon
as
he
learnt
that
cyrus
was
in
cilicia
he
had
turned
round
and
made
his
exit
from
phoenicia
to
join
the
king
with
an
army
amounting
as
report
said
to
three
hundred
thousand
men
from
this
point
cyrus
pursued
his
march
through
syria
a
single
stage
five
parasangs
to
myriandus
a
city
inhabited
by
phoenicians
on
the
this
was
a
commercial
port
and
numerous
merchant
vessels
were
riding
at
anchor
in
the
harbour
here
they
halted
seven
days
and
here
xenias
the
arcadian
general
and
pasion
the
megarian
got
on
board
a
trader
and
having
stowed
away
their
most
valuable
effects
set
sail
for
home
most
people
explained
the
act
as
the
outcome
of
a
fit
of
jealousy
because
cyrus
had
allowed
clearchus
to
retain
their
men
who
had
deserted
to
him
in
hopes
of
returning
to
hellas
instead
of
marching
against
the
king
when
the
two
had
so
vanished
a
rumour
spread
that
cyrus
was
after
them
with
some
ships
of
war
and
some
hoped
the
cowards
might
be
caught
others
pitied
them
if
that
should
be
their
fate
but
cyrus
summoned
the
generals
and
addressed
them
xenias
and
pasion
he
said
have
taken
leave
of
us
but
they
need
not
flatter
themselves
that
in
so
doing
they
have
stolen
into
hiding
i
know
where
they
are
gone
nor
will
they
owe
their
escape
to
speed
i
have
to
capture
their
craft
if
i
like
but
heaven
help
me
if
i
mean
to
pursue
them
never
shall
it
be
said
of
me
that
i
turn
people
to
account
as
long
as
they
stay
with
me
but
as
soon
as
they
are
minded
to
be
off
i
seize
and
maltreat
them
and
strip
them
of
their
wealth
not
so
let
them
go
with
the
consciousness
that
our
behaviour
to
them
is
better
than
theirs
to
us
and
yet
i
have
their
children
and
wives
safe
under
lock
and
key
in
tralles
but
they
shall
not
be
deprived
even
of
these
they
shall
receive
them
back
in
return
for
their
former
goodness
to
me
so
he
spoke
and
the
hellenes
even
those
who
had
been
out
of
heart
at
the
thought
of
marching
up
the
country
when
they
heard
of
the
nobleness
of
cyrus
were
happier
and
more
eager
to
follow
him
on
his
path
after
this
cyrus
marched
onwards
four
stages
twenty
parasangs
to
the
river
chalus
that
river
is
a
hundred
feet
broad
and
is
stocked
with
tame
fish
which
the
syrians
regard
as
gods
and
will
not
suffer
to
be
injured
and
so
too
the
pigeons
of
the
place
the
villages
in
which
they
encamped
belonged
to
parysatis
as
part
of
her
girdle
money
from
this
point
he
marched
on
five
stages
thirty
parasangs
to
the
sources
of
the
river
dardas
which
is
a
hundred
feet
broad
here
stood
the
palace
of
belesys
the
ruler
of
syria
with
its
park
which
was
a
very
large
and
beautiful
one
and
full
of
the
products
of
all
the
seasons
in
their
course
but
cyrus
cut
down
the
park
and
burnt
the
palace
thence
he
marched
on
three
stages
fifteen
parasangs
to
the
river
euphrates
which
is
nearly
half
a
mile
broad
a
large
and
flourishing
city
named
thapsacus
stands
on
its
banks
here
they
halted
five
days
and
here
cyrus
sent
for
the
generals
of
the
hellenes
and
told
them
that
the
advance
was
now
to
be
upon
babylon
against
the
great
king
he
bade
them
communicate
this
information
to
the
soldiers
and
persuade
them
to
follow
the
generals
called
an
assembly
and
announced
the
news
to
the
soldiers
the
latter
were
indignant
and
angry
with
the
generals
accusing
them
of
having
kept
secret
what
they
had
long
known
and
refused
to
go
unless
such
a
bribe
of
money
were
given
them
as
had
been
given
to
their
predecessors
when
they
went
up
with
cyrus
to
the
court
of
his
father
not
as
now
to
fight
a
battle
but
on
a
peaceful
errand
the
visit
of
a
son
to
his
father
by
invitation
the
demand
was
reported
to
cyrus
by
the
generals
and
he
undertook
to
give
each
man
five
silver
minae
as
soon
as
babylon
was
reached
and
their
pay
in
full
until
he
had
safely
conveyed
them
back
to
ionia
again
in
this
manner
the
hellenic
force
were
persuaded
that
is
to
say
the
majority
of
them
menon
indeed
before
it
was
clear
what
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
would
do
whether
in
fact
they
would
follow
cyrus
or
not
collected
his
own
troops
apart
and
made
them
the
following
speech
men
he
said
if
you
will
listen
to
me
there
is
a
method
by
which
without
risk
or
toil
you
may
win
the
special
favour
of
cyrus
beyond
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
you
ask
what
it
is
i
would
have
you
to
do
i
will
tell
you
cyrus
at
this
instant
is
begging
the
hellenes
to
follow
him
to
attack
the
king
i
say
then
cross
the
euphrates
at
once
before
it
is
clear
what
answer
the
rest
will
make
if
they
vote
in
favour
of
following
you
will
get
the
credit
of
having
set
the
example
and
cyrus
will
be
grateful
to
you
he
will
look
upon
you
as
being
the
heartiest
in
his
cause
he
will
repay
as
of
all
others
he
best
knows
how
while
if
the
rest
vote
against
crossing
we
shall
go
back
again
but
as
the
sole
adherents
whose
fidelity
he
can
altogether
trust
it
is
you
whom
cyrus
will
turn
to
account
as
commandants
of
garrisons
or
captains
of
companies
you
need
only
ask
him
for
whatever
you
want
and
you
will
get
it
from
him
as
being
the
friends
of
cyrus
cf
plat
alcib
i
b
why
i
have
been
informed
by
a
credible
person
who
went
up
to
the
king
at
susa
that
he
passed
through
a
large
tract
of
excellent
land
extending
for
nearly
a
day
journey
which
the
people
of
the
country
called
the
girdle
and
another
which
they
called
her
veil
etc
olympiodorus
and
the
scholiast
both
think
that
plato
here
refers
to
xenophon
and
this
passage
of
the
anabasis
grote
thinks
it
very
probable
that
plato
had
in
his
mind
xenophon
either
his
anabasis
or
personal
communications
with
him
the
men
heard
and
obeyed
and
before
the
rest
had
given
their
answer
they
were
already
across
but
when
cyrus
perceived
that
menon
troops
had
crossed
he
was
well
pleased
and
he
sent
glus
to
the
division
in
question
with
this
message
soldiers
accept
my
thanks
at
present
eventually
you
shall
thank
me
i
will
see
to
that
or
my
name
is
not
cyrus
the
soldiers
therefore
could
not
but
pray
heartily
for
his
success
so
high
their
hopes
ran
but
to
menon
it
was
said
he
sent
gifts
with
lordly
liberality
this
done
cyrus
proceeded
to
cross
and
in
his
wake
followed
the
rest
of
the
armament
to
a
man
as
they
forded
never
a
man
was
wetted
above
the
chest
nor
ever
until
this
moment
said
the
men
of
thapascus
had
the
river
been
so
crossed
on
foot
boats
had
always
been
required
but
these
at
the
present
time
abrocomas
in
his
desire
to
hinder
cyrus
from
crossing
had
been
at
pains
to
burn
thus
the
passage
was
looked
upon
as
a
thing
miraculous
the
river
had
manifestly
retired
before
the
face
of
cyrus
like
a
courtier
bowing
to
his
future
king
from
this
place
he
continued
his
march
through
syria
nine
stages
fifty
parasangs
and
they
reached
the
river
araxes
here
were
several
villages
full
of
corn
and
wine
in
which
they
halted
three
days
and
provisioned
the
army
v
thence
he
marched
on
through
arabia
keeping
the
euphrates
on
the
right
five
desert
stages
parasangs
in
this
region
the
ground
was
one
long
level
plain
stretching
far
and
wide
like
the
sea
full
of
absinth
whilst
all
the
other
vegetation
whether
wood
or
reed
was
sweet
scented
like
spice
or
sweet
herb
there
were
no
trees
but
there
was
wild
game
of
all
kinds
wild
asses
in
greatest
abundance
with
plenty
of
ostriches
besides
these
there
were
bustards
and
antelopes
these
creatures
were
occasionally
chased
by
the
cavalry
the
asses
when
pursued
would
run
forward
a
space
and
then
stand
still
their
pace
being
much
swifter
than
that
of
horses
and
as
soon
as
the
horses
came
close
they
went
through
the
same
performance
the
only
way
to
catch
them
was
for
the
riders
to
post
themselves
at
intervals
and
to
hunt
them
in
relays
as
it
were
the
flesh
of
those
they
captured
was
not
unlike
venison
only
more
tender
no
one
was
lucky
enough
to
capture
an
ostrich
some
of
the
troopers
did
give
chase
but
it
had
soon
to
be
abandoned
for
the
bird
in
its
effort
to
escape
speedily
put
a
long
interval
between
itself
and
its
pursuers
plying
its
legs
at
full
speed
and
using
its
wings
the
while
like
a
sail
the
bustards
were
not
so
hard
to
catch
when
started
suddenly
for
they
only
take
short
flights
like
partridges
and
are
soon
tired
their
flesh
is
delicious
as
the
army
wended
its
way
through
this
region
they
reached
the
river
mascas
which
is
one
hundred
feet
in
breadth
here
stood
a
big
deserted
city
called
corsote
almost
literally
environed
by
the
stream
which
flows
round
it
in
a
circle
here
they
halted
three
days
and
provisioned
themselves
thence
they
continued
their
march
thirteen
desert
stages
ninety
parasangs
with
the
euphrates
still
on
their
right
until
they
reached
the
gates
on
these
marches
several
of
the
baggage
animals
perished
of
hunger
for
there
was
neither
grass
nor
green
herb
or
tree
of
any
sort
but
the
country
throughout
was
barren
the
inhabitants
make
their
living
by
quarrying
millstones
on
the
river
banks
which
they
work
up
and
take
to
babylon
and
sell
purchasing
corn
in
exchange
for
their
goods
corn
failed
the
army
and
was
not
to
be
got
for
money
except
in
the
lydian
market
open
in
cyrus
asiatic
army
where
a
kapithe
of
wheat
or
barley
cost
four
shekels
the
shekel
being
equal
to
seven
and
a
half
attic
obols
whilst
the
kapithe
is
the
equivalent
of
two
attic
choeneces
dry
measure
so
that
the
soldiers
subsisted
on
meat
alone
for
the
whole
period
some
of
the
stages
were
very
long
whenever
they
had
to
push
on
to
find
water
or
fodder
and
once
they
found
themselves
involved
in
a
narrow
way
where
the
deep
clay
presented
an
obstacle
to
the
progress
of
the
wagons
cyrus
with
the
nobles
about
him
halted
to
superintend
the
operation
and
ordered
glus
and
pigres
to
take
a
body
of
barbarians
and
to
help
in
extricating
the
wagons
as
they
seemed
to
be
slow
about
the
business
he
turned
round
angrily
to
the
persian
nobles
and
bade
them
lend
a
hand
to
force
the
wagons
out
then
if
ever
what
goes
to
constitute
one
branch
of
good
discipline
was
to
be
witnessed
each
of
those
addressed
just
where
he
chanced
to
be
standing
threw
off
his
purple
cloak
and
flung
himself
into
the
work
with
as
much
eagerness
as
if
it
had
been
a
charge
for
victory
down
a
steep
hill
side
they
flew
with
their
costly
tunics
and
embroidered
trousers
some
with
the
circlets
round
their
necks
and
bracelets
on
their
arms
in
an
instant
they
had
sprung
into
the
miry
clay
and
in
less
time
than
one
could
have
conceived
they
had
landed
the
wagons
safe
on
terra
firma
the
choenix
about
quart
or
according
to
others
pint
it
was
the
minimum
allowance
of
corn
for
a
man
say
a
slave
per
diem
the
spartan
was
allowed
at
the
public
table
choenices
a
day
altogether
it
was
plain
that
cyrus
was
bent
on
pressing
on
the
march
and
averse
to
stoppages
except
where
he
halted
for
the
sake
of
provisioning
or
some
other
necessary
object
being
convinced
that
the
more
rapidly
he
advanced
the
less
prepared
for
battle
would
he
find
the
king
while
the
slower
his
own
progress
the
larger
would
be
the
hostile
army
which
he
would
find
collected
indeed
the
attentive
observer
could
see
at
a
glance
that
if
the
king
empire
was
strong
in
its
extent
of
territory
and
the
number
of
inhabitants
that
strength
is
compensated
by
an
inherent
weakness
dependent
upon
the
length
of
roads
and
the
inevitable
dispersion
of
defensive
forces
where
an
invader
insists
upon
pressing
home
the
war
by
forced
marches
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
euphrates
to
the
point
reached
on
one
of
these
desert
stages
was
a
large
and
flourishing
city
named
charmande
from
this
town
the
soldiers
made
purchases
of
provisions
crossing
the
river
on
rafts
in
the
following
fashion
they
took
the
skins
which
they
used
as
tent
coverings
and
filled
them
with
light
grass
they
then
compressed
and
stitched
them
tightly
together
by
the
ends
so
that
the
water
might
not
touch
the
hay
on
these
they
crossed
and
got
provisions
wine
made
from
the
and
millet
or
the
common
staple
of
the
country
some
dispute
or
other
here
occurred
between
the
soldiers
of
menon
and
clearchus
in
which
clearchus
sentenced
one
of
menon
men
as
the
delinquent
and
had
him
flogged
the
man
went
back
to
his
own
division
and
told
them
hearing
what
had
been
done
to
their
comrade
his
fellows
fretted
and
fumed
and
were
highly
incensed
against
clearchus
the
same
day
clearchus
visited
the
passage
of
the
river
and
after
inspecting
the
market
there
was
returning
with
a
few
followers
on
horseback
to
his
tent
and
had
to
pass
through
menon
quarters
cyrus
had
not
yet
come
up
but
was
riding
up
in
the
same
direction
one
of
menon
men
who
was
splitting
wood
caught
sight
of
clearchus
as
he
rode
past
and
aimed
a
blow
at
him
with
his
axe
the
aim
took
no
effect
when
another
hurled
a
stone
at
him
and
a
third
and
then
several
with
shouts
and
hisses
clearchus
made
a
rapid
retreat
to
his
own
troops
and
at
once
ordered
them
to
get
under
arms
he
bade
his
hoplites
remain
in
position
with
their
shields
resting
against
their
knees
while
he
at
the
head
of
his
thracians
and
horsemen
of
which
he
had
more
than
forty
in
his
army
thracians
for
the
most
part
advanced
against
menon
soldiers
so
that
the
latter
with
menon
himself
were
and
ran
to
seize
their
arms
some
even
stood
riveted
to
the
spot
in
perplexity
at
the
occurrence
just
then
proxenus
came
up
from
behind
as
chance
would
have
it
with
his
division
of
hoplites
and
without
a
moment
hesitation
marched
into
the
open
space
between
the
rival
parties
and
grounded
arms
then
he
fell
to
begging
clearchus
to
desist
the
latter
was
not
too
well
pleased
to
hear
his
trouble
mildly
spoken
of
when
he
had
barely
escaped
being
stoned
to
death
and
he
bade
proxenus
retire
and
leave
the
intervening
space
open
at
this
juncture
cyrus
arrived
and
inquired
what
was
happening
there
was
no
time
for
hesitation
with
his
javelins
firmly
grasped
in
his
hands
he
galloped
up
escorted
by
some
of
his
faithful
bodyguard
who
were
present
and
was
soon
in
the
midst
exclaiming
clearchus
proxenus
and
you
other
hellenes
yonder
you
know
not
what
you
do
as
surely
as
you
come
to
blows
with
one
another
our
fate
is
sealed
this
very
day
i
shall
be
cut
to
pieces
and
so
will
you
your
turn
will
follow
close
on
mine
let
our
fortunes
once
take
an
evil
turn
and
these
barbarians
whom
you
see
around
will
be
worse
foes
to
us
than
those
who
are
at
present
serving
the
king
at
these
words
clearchus
came
to
his
senses
both
parties
paused
from
battle
and
retired
to
their
quarters
order
reigned
vi
as
they
advanced
from
this
point
opposite
charmande
they
came
upon
the
and
dung
of
horses
at
frequent
intervals
it
looked
like
the
trail
of
some
two
thousand
horses
keeping
ahead
of
the
army
these
fellows
burnt
up
the
grass
and
everything
else
that
was
good
for
use
now
there
was
a
persian
named
orontas
he
was
closely
related
to
the
king
by
birth
and
in
matters
pertaining
to
war
reckoned
among
the
best
of
persian
warriors
having
formerly
been
at
war
with
cyrus
and
afterwards
reconciled
to
him
he
now
made
a
conspiracy
to
destroy
him
he
made
a
proposal
to
cyrus
if
cyrus
would
furnish
him
with
a
thousand
horsemen
he
would
deal
with
these
troopers
who
were
burning
down
everything
in
front
of
them
he
would
lay
an
ambuscade
and
cut
them
down
or
he
would
capture
a
host
of
them
alive
in
any
case
he
would
put
a
stop
to
their
aggressiveness
and
burnings
he
would
see
to
it
that
they
did
not
ever
get
a
chance
of
setting
eyes
on
cyrus
army
and
reporting
its
advent
to
the
king
the
proposal
seemed
plausible
to
cyrus
who
accordingly
authorised
orontas
to
take
a
detachment
from
each
of
the
generals
and
be
gone
he
thinking
that
he
had
got
his
horsemen
ready
to
his
hand
wrote
a
letter
to
the
king
announcing
that
he
would
ere
long
join
him
with
as
many
troopers
as
he
could
bring
he
bade
him
at
the
same
time
instruct
the
royal
cavalry
to
welcome
him
as
a
friend
the
letter
further
contained
certain
reminders
of
his
former
friendship
and
fidelity
this
despatch
he
delivered
into
the
hands
of
one
who
was
a
trusty
messenger
as
he
thought
but
the
bearer
took
and
gave
it
to
cyrus
cyrus
read
it
orontas
was
arrested
then
cyrus
summoned
to
his
tent
seven
of
the
noblest
persians
among
his
personal
attendants
and
sent
orders
to
the
hellenic
generals
to
bring
up
a
body
of
hoplites
these
troops
were
to
take
up
a
position
round
his
tent
this
the
generals
did
bringing
up
about
three
thousand
hoplites
clearchus
was
also
invited
inside
to
assist
at
the
a
compliment
due
to
the
position
he
held
among
the
other
generals
in
the
opinion
not
only
of
cyrus
but
also
of
the
rest
of
the
court
when
he
came
out
he
reported
the
circumstances
of
the
trial
as
to
which
indeed
there
was
no
mystery
to
his
friends
he
said
that
cyrus
opened
the
inquiry
with
these
words
i
have
invited
you
hither
my
friends
that
i
may
take
advice
with
you
and
carry
out
whatever
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
it
is
right
for
me
to
do
as
concerning
the
man
before
you
orontas
the
prisoner
was
in
the
first
instance
given
to
me
by
my
father
to
be
my
faithful
subject
in
the
next
place
acting
to
use
his
own
words
under
the
orders
of
my
brother
and
having
hold
of
the
acropolis
of
sardis
he
went
to
war
with
me
i
met
war
with
war
and
forced
him
to
think
it
more
prudent
to
desist
from
war
with
me
whereupon
we
shook
hands
exchanging
solemn
pledges
after
that
and
at
this
point
cyrus
turned
to
orontas
and
addressed
him
personally
after
that
did
i
do
you
any
wrong
answer
never
again
another
question
then
later
on
having
received
as
you
admit
no
injury
from
me
did
you
revolt
to
the
mysians
and
injure
my
territory
as
far
as
in
you
lay
i
did
was
the
reply
then
once
more
having
discovered
the
limits
of
your
power
did
you
flee
to
the
altar
of
artemis
crying
out
that
you
repented
and
did
you
thus
work
upon
my
feelings
that
we
a
second
time
shook
hands
and
made
interchange
of
solemn
pledges
are
these
things
so
orontas
again
assented
then
what
injury
have
you
received
from
me
cyrus
asked
that
now
for
the
third
time
you
have
been
detected
in
a
treasonous
plot
against
me
i
must
needs
do
so
he
answered
then
cyrus
put
one
more
question
but
the
day
may
come
may
it
not
when
you
will
once
again
be
hostile
to
my
brother
and
a
faithful
friend
to
myself
the
other
answered
even
if
i
were
you
could
never
be
brought
to
believe
it
cyrus
at
this
point
cyrus
turned
to
those
who
were
present
and
said
such
has
been
the
conduct
of
the
prisoner
in
the
past
such
is
his
language
now
i
now
call
upon
you
and
you
first
clearchus
to
declare
your
opinion
what
think
you
and
clearchus
answered
my
advice
to
you
is
to
put
this
man
out
of
the
way
as
soon
as
may
be
so
that
we
may
be
saved
the
necessity
of
watching
him
and
have
more
leisure
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
to
requite
the
services
of
those
whose
friendship
is
sincere
to
this
opinion
he
told
us
the
rest
of
the
court
adhered
after
that
at
the
bidding
of
cyrus
each
of
those
present
in
turn
including
the
kinsmen
of
orontas
took
him
by
the
girdle
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
let
him
die
the
death
and
then
those
appointed
led
him
out
and
they
who
in
old
days
were
wont
to
do
obeisance
to
him
could
not
refrain
even
at
that
moment
from
bowing
down
before
him
albeit
they
knew
he
was
being
led
forth
to
death
after
they
had
conducted
him
to
the
tent
of
artapates
the
trustiest
of
cyrus
none
set
eyes
upon
him
ever
again
alive
or
dead
no
one
of
his
own
knowledge
could
declare
the
manner
of
his
death
though
some
conjectured
one
thing
and
some
another
no
tomb
to
mark
his
either
then
or
since
was
ever
seen
vii
from
this
place
cyrus
marched
through
babylonia
three
stages
twelve
parasangs
now
on
the
third
stage
about
midnight
cyrus
held
a
review
of
the
hellenes
and
asiatics
in
the
plain
expecting
that
the
king
would
arrive
the
following
day
with
his
army
to
offer
battle
he
gave
orders
to
clearchus
to
take
command
of
the
right
wing
and
to
menon
the
thessalian
of
the
left
while
he
himself
undertook
to
the
disposition
of
his
own
forces
in
person
after
the
review
with
the
first
approach
of
day
deserters
from
the
great
king
arrived
bringing
cyrus
information
about
the
royal
army
then
cyrus
summoned
the
generals
and
captains
of
the
hellenes
and
held
a
council
of
war
to
arrange
the
plan
of
battle
he
took
this
opportunity
also
to
address
the
following
words
of
compliment
and
encouragement
to
the
meeting
men
of
hellas
he
said
it
is
certainly
not
from
dearth
of
barbarians
to
fight
my
battles
that
i
put
myself
at
your
head
as
my
allies
but
because
i
hold
you
to
be
better
and
stronger
than
many
barbarians
that
is
why
i
took
you
see
then
that
you
prove
yourselves
to
be
men
worthy
of
the
liberty
which
you
possess
and
which
i
envy
you
liberty
it
is
a
thing
which
be
well
assured
i
would
choose
in
preference
to
all
my
other
possessions
multiplied
many
times
but
i
would
like
you
to
know
into
what
sort
of
struggle
you
are
going
learn
its
nature
from
one
who
knows
their
numbers
are
great
and
they
come
on
with
much
noise
but
if
you
can
hold
out
against
these
two
things
i
confess
i
am
ashamed
to
think
what
a
sorry
set
of
folk
you
will
find
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
to
be
but
you
are
men
and
brave
you
must
be
being
men
it
is
agreed
then
if
you
wish
to
return
home
any
of
you
i
undertake
to
send
you
back
in
such
sort
that
your
friends
at
home
shall
envy
you
but
i
flatter
myself
i
shall
persuade
many
of
you
to
accept
what
i
will
offer
you
here
in
lieu
of
what
you
left
at
home
here
gaulites
a
samian
exile
and
a
trusty
friend
of
cyrus
being
present
exclaimed
ay
cyrus
but
some
say
you
can
afford
to
make
large
promises
now
because
you
are
in
the
crisis
of
impending
danger
but
let
matters
go
well
with
you
will
you
recollect
they
shake
their
heads
indeed
some
add
that
even
if
you
did
recollect
and
were
ever
so
willing
you
would
not
be
able
to
make
good
all
your
promises
and
repay
when
cyrus
heard
that
he
answered
you
forget
sirs
my
father
empire
stretches
southwards
to
a
region
where
men
can
not
dwell
by
reason
of
the
heat
and
northwards
to
a
region
uninhabitable
through
cold
but
all
the
intervening
space
is
mapped
out
in
satrapies
belonging
to
my
brother
friends
so
that
if
the
victory
be
ours
it
will
be
ours
also
to
put
our
friends
in
possession
in
their
room
on
the
whole
my
fear
is
not
that
i
may
not
have
enough
to
give
to
each
of
my
friends
but
lest
i
may
not
have
friends
enough
on
whom
to
bestow
what
i
have
to
give
and
to
each
of
you
hellenes
i
will
give
a
crown
of
gold
so
they
when
they
heard
these
words
were
once
more
elated
than
ever
themselves
and
spread
the
good
news
among
the
rest
outside
and
there
came
into
his
presence
both
the
generals
and
some
of
the
other
hellenes
also
claiming
to
know
what
they
should
have
in
the
event
of
victory
and
cyrus
satisfied
the
expectations
of
each
and
all
and
so
dismissed
them
now
the
advice
and
admonition
of
all
who
came
into
conversation
with
him
was
not
to
enter
the
battle
himself
but
to
post
himself
in
rear
of
themselves
and
at
this
season
clearchus
put
a
question
to
him
but
do
you
think
that
your
brother
will
give
battle
to
you
cyrus
and
cyrus
answered
not
without
a
battle
be
assured
shall
the
prize
be
won
if
he
be
the
son
of
darius
and
parysatis
and
a
brother
of
mine
in
the
final
arming
for
battle
at
this
juncture
the
numbers
were
as
follows
of
hellenes
there
were
ten
thousand
four
hundred
heavy
infantry
with
two
thousand
five
hundred
targeteers
while
the
barbarians
with
cyrus
reached
a
total
of
one
hundred
thousand
he
had
too
about
twenty
the
enemy
forces
were
reported
to
number
one
million
two
hundred
thousand
with
two
hundred
besides
which
he
had
six
thousand
cavalry
under
artagerses
these
formed
the
immediate
vanguard
of
the
king
himself
the
royal
army
was
marshalled
by
four
generals
or
each
in
command
of
three
hundred
thousand
men
their
names
were
abrocomas
tissaphernes
gobryas
and
arbaces
but
of
this
total
not
more
than
nine
hundred
thousand
were
engaged
in
the
battle
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
since
abrocomas
on
his
march
from
phoenicia
arrived
five
days
too
late
for
the
battle
such
was
the
information
brought
to
cyrus
by
deserters
who
came
in
from
the
king
army
before
the
battle
and
it
was
corroborated
after
the
battle
by
those
of
the
enemy
who
were
taken
prisoners
from
this
place
cyrus
advanced
one
stage
three
parasangs
with
the
whole
body
of
his
troops
hellenic
and
barbarian
alike
in
order
of
battle
he
expected
the
king
to
give
battle
the
same
day
for
in
the
middle
of
this
day
march
a
deep
sunk
trench
was
reached
thirty
feet
broad
and
eighteen
feet
deep
the
trench
was
carried
inland
through
the
plain
twelve
parasang
distance
to
the
wall
of
media
here
are
canals
flowing
from
the
river
tigris
they
are
four
in
number
each
a
hundred
feet
broad
and
very
deep
with
corn
ships
plying
upon
them
they
empty
themselves
into
the
euphrates
and
are
at
intervals
of
one
parasang
apart
and
are
spanned
by
bridges
for
the
wall
of
media
see
grote

of

foll

and
various
authorities
there
quoted
or
referred
to
the
next
passage
enclosed
in
may
possibly
be
a
commentator
or
editor
note
but
on
the
whole
i
have
thought
it
best
to
keep
the
words
in
the
text
instead
of
relegating
them
as
heretofore
to
a
note
perhaps
some
future
traveller
may
clear
up
all
difficulties
between
the
euphrates
and
the
trench
was
a
narrow
passage
twenty
feet
only
in
breadth
the
trench
itself
had
been
constructed
by
the
great
king
upon
hearing
of
cyrus
approach
to
serve
as
a
line
of
defence
through
this
narrow
passage
then
cyrus
and
his
army
passed
and
found
themselves
safe
inside
the
trench
so
there
was
no
battle
to
be
fought
with
the
king
that
day
only
there
were
numerous
unmistakable
traces
of
horse
and
infantry
in
retreat
here
cyrus
summoned
silanus
his
ambraciot
soothsayer
and
presented
him
with
three
thousand
darics
because
eleven
days
back
when
sacrificing
he
had
told
him
that
the
king
would
not
fight
within
ten
days
and
cyrus
had
answered
well
then
if
he
does
not
fight
within
that
time
he
will
not
fight
at
all
and
if
your
prophecy
comes
true
i
promise
you
ten
talents
so
now
that
the
ten
days
were
passed
he
presented
him
with
the
above
sum
but
as
the
king
had
failed
to
hinder
the
passage
of
cyrus
army
at
the
trench
cyrus
himself
and
the
rest
concluded
that
he
must
have
abandoned
the
idea
of
offering
battle
so
that
next
day
cyrus
advanced
with
less
than
his
former
caution
on
the
third
day
he
was
conducting
the
march
seated
in
his
carriage
with
only
a
small
body
of
troops
drawn
up
in
front
of
him
the
mass
of
the
army
was
moving
on
in
no
kind
of
order
the
soldiers
having
consigned
their
heavy
arms
to
be
carried
in
the
wagons
or
on
the
backs
of
beasts
viii
it
was
already
about
full
market
time
and
the
at
which
the
army
was
to
take
up
quarters
was
nearly
reached
when
pategyas
a
persian
a
trusty
member
of
cyrus
personal
staff
came
galloping
up
at
full
speed
on
his
horse
which
was
bathed
in
sweat
and
to
every
one
he
met
he
shouted
in
greek
and
persian
as
fast
as
he
could
ejaculate
the
words
the
king
is
advancing
with
a
large
army
ready
for
battle
then
ensued
a
scene
of
wild
confusion
the
hellenes
and
all
alike
were
expecting
to
be
attacked
on
the
instant
and
before
they
could
form
their
lines
cyrus
sprang
from
his
carriage
and
donned
his
corselet
then
leaping
on
to
his
charger
back
with
the
javelins
firmly
clutched
he
passed
the
order
to
the
rest
to
arm
themselves
and
fall
into
their
several
ranks
between
and
the
orders
were
carried
out
with
alacrity
the
ranks
shaped
themselves
clearchus
held
the
right
wing
resting
on
the
euphrates
proxenus
was
next
and
after
him
the
rest
while
menon
with
his
troops
held
the
hellenic
left
of
the
asiatics
a
body
of
paphlagonian
cavalry
one
thousand
strong
were
posted
beside
clearchus
on
the
right
and
with
them
stood
the
hellenic
peltasts
on
the
left
was
ariaeus
cyrus
second
in
command
and
the
rest
of
the
barbarian
host
cyrus
was
with
his
bodyguard
of
cavalry
about
six
hundred
strong
all
armed
with
corselets
like
cyrus
and
cuirasses
and
helmets
but
not
so
cyrus
he
went
into
battle
with
head
unhelmeted
so
too
all
the
horses
with
cyrus
wore
and
and
the
troopers
carried
short
hellenic
swords
the
mss
add
to
expose
oneself
to
the
risks
of
war
bareheaded
is
it
is
said
a
practice
common
to
the
persians
which
i
regard
as
a
commentator
note
if
not
an
original
marginal
note
of
some
early
editor
possibly
of
the
author
himself
the
cyropaedeia
is
full
of
such
comments
pieces
justificatives
inserted
into
the
text
it
was
now
and
the
enemy
was
not
yet
in
sight
but
with
the
approach
of
afternoon
was
seen
dust
like
a
white
cloud
and
after
a
considerable
interval
a
black
pall
as
it
were
spread
far
and
high
above
the
plain
as
they
came
nearer
very
soon
was
seen
here
and
there
a
glint
of
bronze
and
and
the
ranks
could
plainly
be
distinguished
on
the
left
were
troopers
wearing
white
cuirasses
that
is
tissaphernes
in
command
they
said
and
next
to
these
a
body
of
men
bearing
and
next
again
infantry
with
long
wooden
shields
reaching
to
the
feet
these
were
the
egyptians
they
said
and
then
other
cavalry
other
bowmen
all
were
in
national
divisions
each
nation
marching
in
squares
and
all
along
their
front
was
a
line
of
chariots
at
considerable
intervals
from
one
another
the
famous
as
they
were
named
having
their
scythes
fitted
to
the
and
stretching
out
slantwise
while
others
protruded
under
the
facing
the
ground
so
as
to
cut
through
all
they
encountered
the
design
was
to
let
them
dash
full
speed
into
the
ranks
of
the
hellenes
and
cut
them
through
curiously
enough
the
anticipation
of
cyrus
when
at
the
council
of
war
he
admonished
the
hellenes
not
to
mind
the
shouting
of
the
asiatics
was
not
justified
instead
of
shouting
they
came
on
in
deep
silence
softly
and
slowly
with
even
tread
at
this
instant
cyrus
riding
past
in
person
accompanied
by
pigres
his
interpreter
and
three
or
four
others
called
aloud
to
clearchus
to
advance
against
the
centre
for
there
the
king
was
to
be
found
and
if
we
strike
home
at
this
point
he
added
our
work
is
finished
clearchus
though
he
could
see
the
compact
body
at
the
centre
and
had
been
told
by
cyrus
that
the
king
lay
outside
the
hellenic
left
for
owing
to
numerical
superiority
the
king
while
holding
his
own
centre
could
well
overlap
cyrus
extreme
left
still
hesitated
to
draw
off
his
right
wing
from
the
river
for
fear
of
being
turned
on
both
flanks
and
he
simply
replied
assuring
cyrus
that
he
would
take
care
all
went
well
at
this
time
the
barbarian
army
was
evenly
advancing
and
the
hellenic
division
was
still
riveted
to
the
spot
completing
its
formation
as
the
various
contingents
came
up
cyrus
riding
past
at
some
distance
from
the
lines
glanced
his
eye
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
the
other
so
as
to
take
a
complete
survey
of
friends
and
foes
when
xenophon
the
athenian
seeing
him
rode
up
from
the
hellenic
quarter
to
meet
him
asking
him
whether
he
had
any
orders
to
give
cyrus
pulling
up
his
horse
begged
him
to
make
the
announcement
generally
known
that
the
omens
from
the
victims
internal
and
external
alike
were
good
while
he
was
still
speaking
he
heard
a
confused
murmur
passing
through
the
ranks
and
asked
what
it
meant
the
other
replied
that
it
was
the
watchword
being
passed
down
for
the
second
time
cyrus
wondered
who
had
given
the
order
and
asked
what
the
watchword
was
on
being
told
it
was
zeus
our
saviour
and
victory
he
replied
i
accept
it
so
let
it
be
and
with
that
remark
rode
away
to
his
own
position
and
now
the
two
battle
lines
were
no
more
than
three
or
four
furlongs
apart
when
the
hellenes
began
chanting
the
paean
and
at
the
same
time
advanced
against
the
enemy
the
omens
from
inspecting
the
innards
of
the
victims
and
the
omens
from
the
acts
and
movements
of
the
victims
but
with
the
forward
movement
a
certain
portion
of
the
line
curved
onwards
in
advance
with
sinuosity
and
the
portion
left
behind
quickened
to
a
run
and
simultaneously
a
thrilling
cry
burst
from
all
lips
like
that
in
honour
of
the
eleleu
eleleu
and
the
running
became
general
some
say
they
clashed
their
shields
and
spears
thereby
causing
terror
to
the
horses
and
before
they
had
got
within
arrowshot
the
barbarians
swerved
and
took
to
flight
and
now
the
hellenes
gave
chase
with
might
and
main
checked
only
by
shouts
to
one
another
not
to
race
but
to
keep
their
ranks
the
enemy
chariots
reft
of
their
charioteers
swept
onwards
some
through
the
enemy
themselves
others
past
the
hellenes
they
as
they
saw
them
coming
opened
a
gap
and
let
them
pass
one
fellow
like
some
dumbfoundered
mortal
on
a
racecourse
was
caught
by
the
heels
but
even
he
they
said
received
no
hurt
nor
indeed
with
the
single
exception
of
some
one
on
the
left
wing
who
was
said
to
have
been
wounded
by
an
arrow
did
any
hellene
in
this
battle
suffer
a
single
hurt
some
critics
regard
this
sentence
as
an
editor
or
note
cyrus
seeing
the
hellene
conquering
as
far
as
they
at
any
rate
were
concerned
and
in
hot
pursuit
was
well
content
but
in
spite
of
his
joy
and
the
salutations
offered
him
at
that
moment
by
those
about
him
as
though
he
were
already
king
he
was
not
led
away
to
join
in
the
pursuit
but
keeping
his
squadron
of
six
hundred
horsemen
in
cloe
order
waited
and
watched
to
see
what
the
king
himself
would
do
the
king
he
knew
held
the
centre
of
the
persian
army
indeed
it
is
the
fashion
for
the
asiatic
monarch
to
occupy
that
position
during
action
for
this
twofold
reason
he
holds
the
safest
place
with
his
troops
on
either
side
of
him
while
if
he
has
occasion
to
despatch
any
necessary
rider
along
the
lines
his
troops
will
receive
the
message
in
half
the
time
the
king
accordingly
on
this
occasion
held
the
centre
of
his
army
but
for
all
that
he
was
outside
cyrus
left
wing
and
seeing
that
no
one
offered
him
battle
in
front
nor
yet
the
troops
in
front
of
him
he
wheeled
as
if
to
encircle
the
enemy
it
was
then
that
cyrus
in
apprehension
lest
the
king
might
get
round
to
the
rear
and
cut
to
pieces
the
hellenic
body
charged
to
meet
him
attacking
with
his
six
hundred
he
mastered
the
line
of
troops
in
front
of
the
king
and
put
to
flight
the
six
thousand
cutting
down
as
is
said
with
his
own
hand
their
general
artagerses
but
as
soon
as
the
rout
commenced
cyrus
own
six
hundred
themselves
in
the
ardour
of
pursuit
were
scattered
with
the
exception
of
a
handful
who
were
left
with
cyrus
himself
chiefly
his
table
companions
left
alone
with
these
he
caught
sight
of
the
king
and
the
close
throng
about
him
unable
longer
to
contain
himself
with
a
cry
i
see
the
man
he
rushed
at
him
and
dealt
a
blow
at
his
chest
wounding
him
through
the
corselet
this
according
to
the
statement
of
ctesias
the
surgeon
who
further
states
that
he
himself
healed
the
wound
as
cyrus
delivered
the
blow
some
one
struck
him
with
a
javelin
under
the
eye
severely
and
in
the
struggle
which
then
ensued
between
the
king
and
cyrus
and
those
about
them
to
protect
one
or
other
we
have
the
statement
of
ctesias
as
to
the
number
slain
on
the
king
side
for
he
was
by
his
side
on
the
other
cyrus
himself
fell
and
eight
of
his
bravest
companions
lay
on
the
top
of
him
the
story
says
that
artapes
the
trustiest
among
his
when
he
saw
that
cyrus
had
fallen
to
the
ground
leapt
from
his
horse
and
threw
his
arms
about
him
then
as
one
account
says
the
king
bade
one
slay
him
as
a
worthy
victim
to
his
brother
others
say
that
artapates
drew
his
scimitar
and
slew
himself
by
his
own
hand
a
golden
scimitar
it
is
true
he
had
he
wore
also
a
collar
and
bracelets
and
the
other
ornaments
such
as
the
noblest
persians
wear
for
his
kindliness
and
fidelity
had
won
him
honours
at
the
hands
of
cyrus

son

so
died
cyrus
a
man
the
kingliest
and
most
worthy
to
rule
of
all
the
persians
who
have
lived
since
the
elder
cyrus
according
to
the
concurrent
testimony
of
all
who
are
reputed
to
have
known
him
intimately
to
begin
from
the
beginning
when
still
a
boy
and
whilst
being
brought
up
with
his
brother
and
the
other
lads
his
unrivalled
excellence
was
recognised
for
the
sons
of
the
noblest
persians
it
must
be
known
are
brought
up
one
and
all
at
the
king
portals
here
lessons
of
sobriety
and
may
largely
be
laid
to
heart
while
there
is
nothing
base
or
ugly
for
eye
or
ear
to
feed
upon
there
is
the
daily
spectacle
ever
before
the
boys
of
some
receiving
honour
from
the
king
and
again
of
others
receiving
dishonour
and
the
tale
of
all
this
is
in
their
ears
so
that
from
earliest
boyhood
they
learn
how
to
rule
and
to
be
ruled
the
character
now
to
be
drawn
is
afterwards
elaborated
into
the
cyrus
of
the
cyropaedeia
in
this
courtly
training
cyrus
earned
a
double
reputation
first
he
was
held
to
be
a
paragon
of
modesty
among
his
fellows
rendering
an
obedience
to
his
elders
which
exceeded
that
of
many
of
his
own
inferiors
and
next
he
bore
away
the
palm
for
skill
in
horsemanship
and
for
love
of
the
animal
itself
nor
less
in
matters
of
war
in
the
use
of
the
bow
and
the
javelin
was
he
held
by
men
in
general
to
be
at
once
the
aptest
of
learners
and
the
most
eager
practiser
as
soon
as
his
age
permitted
the
same
showed
itself
in
his
fondness
for
the
chase
not
without
a
certain
appetite
for
perilous
adventure
in
facing
the
wild
beasts
themselves
once
a
bear
made
a
furious
rush
at
him
and
without
wincing
he
grappled
with
her
and
was
pulled
from
his
horse
receiving
wounds
the
scars
of
which
were
visible
through
life
but
in
the
end
he
slew
the
creature
nor
did
he
forget
him
who
first
came
to
his
aid
but
made
him
enviable
in
the
eyes
of
many
the
elder
cyrus
when
a
boy
kills
not
a
bear
but
a
boar
after
he
had
been
sent
down
by
his
father
to
be
satrap
of
lydia
and
great
phrygia
and
cappadocia
and
had
been
appointed
general
of
the
forces
whose
business
it
is
to
muster
in
the
plain
of
the
castolus
nothing
was
more
noticeable
in
his
conduct
than
the
importance
which
he
attached
to
the
faithful
fulfilment
of
every
treaty
or
compact
or
undertaking
entered
into
with
others
he
would
tell
no
lies
to
any
one
thus
doubtless
it
was
that
he
won
the
confidence
alike
of
individuals
and
of
the
communities
entrusted
to
his
care
or
in
case
of
hostility
a
treaty
made
with
cyrus
was
a
guarantee
sufficient
to
the
combatant
that
he
would
suffer
nothing
contrary
to
its
terms
therefore
in
the
war
with
tissaphernes
all
the
states
of
their
own
accord
chose
cyrus
in
lieu
of
tissaphernes
except
only
the
men
of
miletus
and
these
were
only
alienated
through
fear
of
him
because
he
refused
to
abandon
their
exiled
citizens
and
his
deeds
and
words
bore
emphatic
witness
to
his
principle
even
if
they
were
weakened
in
number
or
in
fortune
he
would
never
abandon
those
who
had
once
become
his
friends
he
made
no
secret
of
his
endeavour
to
outdo
his
friends
and
his
foes
alike
in
reciprocity
of
conduct
the
prayer
has
been
attributed
to
him
god
grant
i
may
live
along
enough
to
recompense
my
friends
and
requite
my
foes
with
a
strong
arm
however
this
may
be
no
one
at
least
in
our
days
ever
drew
together
so
ardent
a
following
of
friends
eager
to
lay
at
his
feet
their
money
their
cities
their
own
lives
and
persons
nor
is
it
to
be
inferred
from
this
that
he
suffered
the
malefactor
and
the
wrongdoer
to
laugh
him
to
scorn
on
the
contrary
these
he
punished
most
unflinchingly
it
was
no
rare
sight
to
see
on
the
highways
men
who
had
forfeited
hand
or
foot
or
eye
the
result
being
that
throughout
the
satrapy
of
cyrus
any
one
hellene
or
barbarian
provided
he
were
innocent
might
fearlessly
travel
wherever
he
pleased
and
take
with
him
whatever
he
felt
disposed
however
as
all
allowed
it
was
for
the
brave
in
war
that
he
reserved
especial
honour
to
take
the
first
instance
to
hand
he
had
a
war
with
the
pisidians
and
mysians
being
himself
at
the
head
of
an
expedition
into
those
territories
he
could
observe
those
who
voluntarily
encountered
risks
these
he
made
rulers
of
the
territory
which
he
subjected
and
afterwards
honoured
them
with
other
gifts
so
that
if
the
good
and
brave
were
set
on
a
pinnacle
of
fortune
cowards
were
recognised
as
their
natural
slaves
and
so
it
befell
that
cyrus
never
had
lack
of
volunteers
in
any
service
of
danger
whenever
it
was
expected
that
his
eye
would
be
upon
them
so
again
wherever
he
might
discover
any
one
ready
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
service
of
uprightness
his
delight
was
to
make
this
man
richer
than
those
who
seek
for
gain
by
unfair
means
on
the
same
principle
his
own
administration
was
in
all
respects
uprightly
conducted
and
in
particular
he
secured
the
services
of
an
army
worthy
of
the
name
generals
and
subalterns
alike
came
to
him
from
across
the
seas
not
merely
to
make
money
but
because
they
saw
that
loyalty
to
cyrus
was
a
more
profitable
investment
than
so
many
pounds
a
month
let
any
man
whatsoever
render
him
willing
service
such
enthusiasm
was
sure
to
win
its
reward
and
so
cyrus
could
always
command
the
service
of
the
best
assistants
it
was
said
whatever
the
work
might
be
or
if
he
saw
any
skilful
and
just
steward
who
furnished
well
the
country
over
which
he
ruled
and
created
revenues
so
far
from
robbing
him
at
any
time
to
him
who
had
he
delighted
to
give
more
so
that
toil
was
a
pleasure
and
gains
were
amassed
with
confidence
and
least
of
all
from
cyrus
would
a
man
conceal
the
amount
of
his
possessions
seeing
that
he
showed
no
jealousy
of
wealth
openly
avowed
but
his
endeavour
was
rather
to
turn
to
account
the
riches
of
those
who
kept
them
secret
towards
the
friends
he
had
made
whose
kindliness
he
knew
or
whose
fitness
as
with
himself
in
aught
which
he
might
wish
to
carry
out
he
had
tested
he
showed
himself
in
turn
an
adept
in
the
arts
of
courtesy
just
in
proportion
as
he
felt
the
need
of
this
friend
or
that
to
help
him
so
he
tried
to
help
each
of
them
in
return
in
whatever
seemed
to
be
their
heart
desire
many
were
the
gifts
bestowed
on
him
for
many
and
diverse
reasons
no
one
man
perhaps
ever
received
more
no
one
certainly
was
ever
more
ready
to
bestow
them
upon
others
with
an
eye
ever
to
the
taste
of
each
so
as
to
gratify
what
he
saw
to
be
the
individual
requirement
many
of
these
presents
were
sent
to
him
to
serve
as
personal
adornments
of
the
body
or
for
battle
and
as
touching
these
he
would
say
how
am
i
to
deck
myself
out
in
all
these
to
my
mind
a
chief
ornament
is
the
adornment
of
friends
indeed
that
he
should
triumph
over
his
friends
in
the
great
matters
of
welldoing
is
not
surprising
seeing
that
he
was
much
more
powerful
than
they
but
that
he
should
go
beyond
them
in
minute
attentions
and
in
an
eager
desire
to
give
pleasure
seems
to
me
i
must
confess
more
admirable
frequently
when
he
had
tasted
some
specially
excellent
wine
he
would
send
the
half
remaining
flagon
to
some
friend
with
a
message
to
say
cyrus
says
this
is
the
best
wine
he
has
tasted
for
a
long
time
that
is
his
excuse
for
sending
it
to
you
he
hopes
you
will
drink
it
up
with
a
choice
party
of
friends
or
perhaps
he
would
send
the
remainder
of
a
dish
of
geese
half
loaves
of
bread
and
so
forth
the
bearer
being
instructed
to
say
this
is
favourite
dish
he
hopes
you
will
taste
it
yourself
or
perhaps
there
was
a
great
dearth
of
provender
when
through
the
number
of
his
servants
and
his
own
careful
forethought
he
was
enabled
to
get
supplies
for
himself
at
such
times
he
would
send
to
his
friends
in
different
parts
bidding
them
feed
their
horses
on
his
hay
since
it
would
not
do
for
the
horses
that
carried
his
friends
to
go
starving
then
on
any
long
march
or
expedition
where
the
crowd
of
would
be
large
he
would
call
his
friends
to
him
and
entertain
them
with
serious
talk
as
much
as
to
say
these
i
delight
to
honour
so
that
for
myself
and
from
all
that
i
can
hear
i
should
be
disposed
to
say
that
no
one
greek
or
barbarian
was
ever
so
beloved
in
proof
of
this
i
may
cite
the
fact
that
though
cyrus
was
the
king
vassal
and
slave
no
one
ever
forsook
him
to
join
his
master
if
i
may
except
the
attempt
of
orontas
which
was
abortive
that
man
indeed
had
to
learn
that
cyrus
was
closer
to
the
heart
of
him
on
whose
fidelity
he
relied
than
he
himself
was
on
the
other
hand
many
a
man
revolted
from
the
king
to
cyrus
after
they
went
to
war
with
one
another
nor
were
these
nobodies
but
rather
persons
high
in
the
king
affection
yet
for
all
that
they
believed
that
their
virtues
would
obtain
a
reward
more
adequate
from
cyrus
than
from
the
king
another
great
proof
at
once
of
his
own
worth
and
of
his
capacity
rightly
to
discern
all
loyal
loving
and
firm
friendship
is
afforded
by
an
incident
which
belongs
to
the
last
moment
of
his
life
he
was
slain
but
fighting
for
his
life
beside
him
fell
also
every
one
of
his
faithful
bodyguard
of
friends
and
with
the
sole
exception
of
ariaeus
who
was
in
command
of
the
cavalry
on
the
left
and
he
no
sooner
perceived
the
fall
of
cyrus
than
he
betook
himself
to
flight
with
the
whole
body
of
troops
under
his
lead
x
then
the
head
of
cyrus
and
his
right
hand
were
severed
from
the
body
but
the
king
and
those
about
him
pursued
and
fell
upon
the
cyreian
camp
and
the
troops
of
ariaeus
no
longer
stood
their
ground
but
fled
through
their
own
camp
back
to
the
of
the
night
before
a
distance
of
four
parasangs
it
was
said
so
the
king
and
those
with
him
fell
to
ravaging
right
and
left
and
amongst
other
spoil
he
captured
the
phocaean
woman
who
was
a
concubine
of
cyrus
witty
and
beautiful
if
fame
speaks
correctly
the
milesian
who
was
the
younger
was
also
seized
by
some
of
the
king
men
but
letting
go
her
outer
garment
she
made
good
her
escape
to
the
hellenes
who
had
been
left
among
the
camp
followers
on
guard
these
fell
at
once
into
line
and
put
to
the
sword
many
of
the
pillagers
though
they
lost
some
men
themselves
they
stuck
to
the
place
and
succeeded
in
saving
not
only
that
lady
but
all
else
whether
chattels
or
human
beings
which
lay
within
their
reach
at
this
point
the
king
and
the
hellenes
were
something
like
three
miles
apart
the
one
set
were
pursuing
their
opponents
just
as
if
their
conquest
had
been
general
the
others
were
pillaging
as
merrily
as
if
their
victory
were
already
universal
but
when
the
hellenes
learnt
that
the
king
and
his
troops
were
in
the
baggage
camp
and
the
king
on
his
side
was
informed
by
tissaphernes
that
the
hellenes
were
victorious
in
their
quarter
of
the
field
and
had
gone
forward
in
pursuit
the
effect
was
instantaneous
the
king
massed
his
troops
and
formed
into
line
clearchus
summoned
proxenus
who
was
next
him
and
debated
whether
to
send
a
detachment
or
to
go
in
a
body
to
the
camp
to
save
it
meanwhile
the
king
was
seen
again
advancing
as
it
seemed
from
the
rear
and
the
hellenes
turning
right
about
prepared
to
receive
his
attack
then
and
there
but
instead
of
advancing
upon
them
at
that
point
he
drew
off
following
the
line
by
which
he
had
passed
earlier
in
the
day
outside
the
left
wing
of
his
opponent
and
so
picked
up
in
his
passage
those
who
had
deserted
to
the
hellenes
during
the
battle
as
also
tissaphernes
and
his
division
the
latter
had
not
fled
in
the
first
shock
of
the
encounter
he
had
charged
parallel
to
the
line
of
the
euphrates
into
the
greek
peltasts
and
through
them
but
charge
as
he
might
he
did
not
lay
low
a
single
man
on
the
contrary
the
hellenes
made
a
gap
to
let
them
through
hacking
them
with
their
swords
and
hurling
their
javelins
as
they
passed
episthenes
of
amphipolis
was
in
command
of
the
peltasts
and
he
showed
himself
a
sensible
man
it
was
said
thus
it
was
that
tissaphernes
having
got
through
haphazard
with
rather
the
worst
of
it
failed
to
wheel
round
and
return
the
way
he
came
but
reaching
the
camp
of
the
hellenes
there
fell
in
with
the
king
and
falling
into
order
again
the
two
divisions
advanced
side
by
side
when
they
were
parallel
with
the
original
left
wing
of
the
hellenes
fear
seized
the
latter
lest
they
might
take
them
in
flank
and
enfold
them
on
both
sides
and
cut
them
down
in
this
apprehension
they
determined
to
extend
their
line
and
place
the
river
on
their
rear
but
while
they
deliberated
the
king
passed
by
and
ranged
his
troops
in
line
to
meet
them
in
exactly
the
same
position
in
which
he
had
advanced
to
offer
battle
at
the
commencement
of
the
engagement
the
hellenes
now
seeing
them
in
close
proximity
and
in
battle
order
once
again
raised
the
paean
and
began
the
attack
with
still
greater
enthusiasm
than
before
and
once
again
the
barbarians
did
not
wait
to
receive
them
but
took
to
flight
even
at
a
greater
distance
than
before
the
hellenes
pressed
the
pursuit
until
they
reached
a
certain
village
where
they
halted
for
above
the
village
rose
a
mound
on
which
the
king
and
his
party
rallied
and
reformed
they
had
no
infantry
any
longer
but
the
crest
was
crowded
with
cavalry
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
discover
what
was
happening
they
did
see
they
said
the
royal
standard
a
kind
of
golden
eagle
with
wings
extended
perched
on
a
bar
of
wood
and
raised
upon
a
lance
but
as
soon
as
the
hellenes
again
moved
onwards
the
hostile
cavalry
at
once
left
the
hillock
not
in
a
body
any
longer
but
in
fragments
some
streaming
from
one
side
some
from
another
and
the
crest
was
gradually
stripped
of
its
occupants
till
at
last
the
company
was
gone
accordingly
clearchus
did
not
ascend
the
crest
but
posting
his
army
at
its
base
he
sent
lycius
of
syracuse
and
another
to
the
summit
with
orders
to
inspect
the
condition
of
things
on
the
other
side
and
to
report
results
lycius
galloped
up
and
investigated
bringing
back
news
that
they
were
fleeing
might
and
main
almost
at
that
instant
the
sun
sank
beneath
the
horizon
there
the
hellenes
halted
they
grounded
arms
and
rested
marvelling
the
while
that
cyrus
was
not
anywhere
to
be
seen
and
that
no
messenger
had
come
from
him
for
they
were
in
complete
ignorance
of
his
death
and
conjectured
that
either
he
had
gone
off
in
pursuit
or
had
pushed
forward
to
occupy
some
point
left
to
themselves
they
now
deliberated
whether
they
should
stay
where
they
were
and
have
the
baggage
train
brought
up
or
should
return
to
camp
they
resolved
to
return
and
about
supper
time
reached
the
tents
such
was
the
conclusion
of
this
day
they
found
the
larger
portion
of
their
property
pillaged
eatables
and
drinkables
alike
not
excepting
the
wagons
laden
with
corn
and
wine
which
cyrus
had
prepared
in
case
of
some
extreme
need
overtaking
the
expedition
to
divide
among
the
hellenes
there
were
four
hundred
of
these
wagons
it
was
said
and
these
had
now
been
ransacked
by
the
king
and
his
men
so
that
the
greater
number
of
the
hellenes
went
supperless
having
already
gone
without
their
breakfasts
since
the
king
had
appeared
before
the
usual
halt
for
breakfast
accordingly
in
no
better
plight
than
this
they
passed
the
night
book
ii
in
the
previous
book
will
be
found
a
full
account
of
the
method
by
which
cyrus
collected
a
body
of
greeks
when
meditating
an
expedition
against
his
brother
artaxerxes
as
also
of
various
occurrences
on
the
march
up
of
the
battle
itself
and
of
the
death
of
cyrus
and
lastly
a
description
of
the
arrival
of
the
hellenes
in
camp
after
the
battle
and
as
to
how
they
betook
themselves
to
rest
none
suspecting
but
what
they
were
altogether
victorious
and
that
cyrus
lived
i
with
the
break
of
day
the
generals
met
and
were
surprised
that
cyrus
should
not
have
appeared
himself
or
at
any
rate
have
sent
some
one
to
tell
them
what
to
do
accordingly
they
resolved
to
put
what
they
had
together
to
get
under
arms
and
to
push
forward
until
they
effected
junction
with
cyrus
just
as
they
were
on
the
point
of
starting
with
the
rising
sun
came
procles
the
ruler
of
teuthrania
he
was
a
descendant
of
damaratus
the
laconian
and
with
him
also
came
glus
the
son
of
tamos
these
two
told
them
first
that
cyrus
was
dead
next
that
ariaeus
had
retreated
with
the
rest
of
the
barbarians
to
the
whence
they
had
started
at
dawn
on
the
previous
day
and
wished
to
inform
them
that
if
they
were
minded
to
come
he
would
wait
for
this
one
day
but
on
the
morrow
he
should
return
home
again
to
ionia
whence
he
came
the
spartan
king
who
was
deposed
in
whereupon
he
fled
to
king
darius
and
settled
in
mysia
see
herod
vi
we
shall
hear
more
of
his
descendant
procles
the
ruler
of
teuthrania
in
the
last
chapter
of
this
work
when
they
heard
these
tidings
the
generals
were
sorely
distressed
so
too
were
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
when
they
were
informed
of
it
then
clearchus
spoke
as
follows
would
that
cyrus
were
yet
alive
but
since
he
is
dead
take
back
this
answer
to
ariaeus
that
we
at
any
rate
have
conquered
the
king
and
as
you
yourselves
may
see
there
is
not
a
man
left
in
the
field
to
meet
us
indeed
had
you
not
arrived
we
should
ere
this
have
begun
our
march
upon
the
king
now
we
can
promise
to
ariaeus
that
if
he
will
join
us
here
we
will
place
him
on
the
king
throne
surely
to
those
who
conquer
empire
pertains
with
these
words
he
sent
back
the
messengers
and
with
them
he
sent
cheirisophus
the
laconian
and
menon
the
thessalian
that
was
what
menon
himself
wished
being
as
he
was
a
friend
and
intimate
of
ariaeus
and
bound
by
mutual
ties
of
hospitality
so
these
set
off
and
clearchus
waited
for
them
the
soldiers
furnished
themselves
with
food
and
drink
as
best
they
might
falling
back
on
the
baggage
animals
and
cutting
up
oxen
and
asses
there
was
no
lack
of
firewood
they
need
only
step
forward
a
few
paces
from
the
line
where
the
battle
was
fought
and
they
would
find
arrows
to
hand
in
abundance
which
the
hellenes
had
forced
the
deserters
from
the
king
to
throw
away
there
were
arrows
and
wicker
shields
also
and
the
huge
wooden
shields
of
the
egyptians
there
were
many
targets
also
and
empty
wagons
left
to
be
carried
off
here
was
a
store
which
they
were
not
slow
to
make
use
of
to
cook
their
meat
and
serve
their
meals
that
day
it
was
now
about
full
market
hour
when
heralds
from
the
king
and
tissaphernes
arrived
these
were
barbarians
with
one
exception
this
was
a
certain
phalinus
a
hellene
who
lived
at
the
court
of
tissaphernes
and
was
held
in
high
esteem
he
gave
himself
out
to
be
a
connoisseur
of
tactics
and
the
art
of
fighting
with
heavy
arms
these
were
the
men
who
now
came
up
and
having
summoned
the
generals
of
the
hellenes
they
delivered
themselves
of
the
following
message
the
great
king
having
won
the
victory
and
slain
cyrus
bids
the
hellenes
to
surrender
their
arms
to
betake
themselves
to
the
gates
of
the
king
palace
and
there
obtain
for
themselves
what
terms
they
can
that
was
what
the
heralds
said
and
the
hellenes
listened
with
heavy
hearts
but
clearchus
spoke
and
his
words
were
few
conquerors
do
not
as
a
rule
give
up
their
arms
then
turning
to
the
others
he
added
i
leave
it
to
you
my
to
make
the
best
and
noblest
answer
that
ye
may
to
these
gentlemen
i
will
rejoin
you
presently
at
the
moment
an
official
had
summoned
him
to
come
and
look
at
the
entrails
which
had
been
taken
out
for
as
it
chanced
he
was
engaged
in
sacrificing
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
cleanor
the
arcadian
by
right
of
seniority
answered
they
would
sooner
die
than
give
up
their
arms
then
proxenus
the
theban
said
for
my
part
i
marvel
if
the
king
demands
our
arms
as
our
master
or
for
the
sake
of
friendship
merely
as
presents
if
as
our
master
why
need
he
ask
for
them
rather
than
come
and
take
them
but
if
he
would
fain
wheedle
us
out
of
them
by
fine
speeches
he
should
tell
us
what
the
soldiers
will
receive
in
turn
for
such
kindness
in
answer
to
him
phalinus
said
the
king
claims
to
have
conquered
because
he
has
put
cyrus
to
death
and
who
is
there
now
to
claim
the
kingdom
as
against
himself
he
further
flatters
himself
that
you
also
are
in
his
power
since
he
holds
you
in
the
heart
of
his
country
hemmed
in
by
impassable
rivers
and
he
can
at
any
moment
bring
against
you
a
multitude
so
vast
that
even
if
leave
were
given
to
rise
and
slay
you
could
not
kill
them
after
him
theopompus
the
athenian
spoke
phalinus
he
said
at
this
instant
as
you
yourself
can
see
we
have
nothing
left
but
our
arms
and
our
valour
if
we
keep
the
former
we
imagine
we
can
make
use
of
the
latter
but
if
we
deliver
up
our
arms
we
shall
presently
be
robbed
of
our
lives
do
not
suppose
then
that
we
are
going
to
give
up
to
you
the
only
good
things
which
we
possess
we
prefer
to
keep
them
and
by
their
help
we
will
do
battle
with
you
for
the
good
things
which
are
yours
phalinus
laughed
when
he
heard
those
words
and
said
spoken
like
a
philosopher
my
fine
young
man
and
very
pretty
reasoning
too
yet
let
me
tell
you
your
wits
are
somewhat
scattered
if
you
imagine
that
your
valour
will
get
the
better
of
the
power
there
were
one
or
two
others
it
was
said
who
with
a
touch
of
weakness
in
their
tone
or
argument
made
answer
they
had
proved
good
and
trusty
friends
to
cyrus
and
the
king
might
find
them
no
less
valuable
if
he
liked
to
be
friends
with
them
he
might
turn
them
to
any
use
that
pleased
his
fancy
say
for
a
campaign
against
egypt
their
arms
were
at
his
service
they
would
help
to
lay
that
country
at
his
feet
so
the
best
mss
others
read
xenophon
which
kruger
maintains
to
be
the
true
reading
he
suggests
that
theopompus
may
have
crept
into
the
text
from
a
marginal
note
of
a
scholiast
theopompus
the
historian
gives
the
remark
to
proxenus
just
then
clearchus
returned
and
wished
to
know
what
answer
they
had
given
the
words
were
barely
out
of
his
mouth
before
phalinus
interrupting
answered
as
for
your
friends
here
one
says
one
thing
and
one
another
will
you
please
give
us
your
opinion
and
he
replied
the
sight
of
you
phalinus
caused
me
much
pleasure
and
not
only
me
but
all
of
us
i
feel
sure
for
you
are
a
hellene
even
as
we
are
every
one
of
us
whom
you
see
before
you
in
our
present
plight
we
would
like
to
take
you
into
our
counsel
as
to
what
we
had
better
do
touching
your
proposals
i
beg
you
then
solemnly
in
the
sight
of
heaven
do
you
tender
us
such
advice
as
you
shall
deem
best
and
worthiest
and
such
as
shall
bring
you
honour
of
after
time
when
it
will
be
said
of
you
how
once
on
a
time
phalinus
was
sent
by
the
great
king
to
bid
certain
hellenes
yield
up
their
arms
and
when
they
had
taken
him
into
their
counsel
he
gave
them
such
and
such
advice
you
know
that
whatever
advice
you
do
give
us
can
not
fail
to
be
reported
in
hellas
clearchus
threw
out
these
leading
remarks
in
hopes
that
this
man
who
was
the
ambassador
from
the
king
might
himself
be
led
to
advise
them
not
to
give
up
their
arms
in
which
case
the
hellenes
would
be
still
more
sanguine
and
hopeful
but
contrary
to
his
expectation
phalinus
turned
round
and
said
i
say
that
if
you
have
one
chance
one
hope
in
ten
thousand
to
wage
a
war
with
the
king
successfully
do
not
give
up
your
arms
that
is
my
advice
if
however
you
have
no
chance
of
escape
without
the
king
consent
then
i
say
save
yourselves
in
the
only
way
you
can
and
clearchus
answered
so
then
that
is
your
deliberate
view
well
this
is
our
answer
take
it
back
we
conceive
that
in
either
case
whether
we
are
expected
to
be
friends
with
the
king
we
shall
be
worth
more
as
friends
if
we
keep
our
arms
than
if
we
yield
them
to
another
or
whether
we
are
to
go
to
war
we
shall
fight
better
with
them
than
without
and
phalinus
said
that
answer
we
will
repeat
but
the
king
bade
me
tell
you
this
besides
you
remain
here
there
is
truce
but
one
step
forward
or
one
step
back
the
truce
ends
there
is
war
will
you
then
please
inform
us
as
to
that
point
also
are
you
minded
to
stop
and
keep
truce
or
is
there
to
be
war
what
answer
shall
i
take
from
you
and
clearchus
replied
pray
answer
that
we
hold
precisely
the
same
views
on
this
point
as
the
king
how
say
you
the
same
views
asked
phalinus
clearchus
made
answer
as
long
as
we
stay
here
there
is
truce
but
a
step
forward
or
a
step
backward
the
truce
ends
there
is
war
the
other
again
asked
peace
or
war
what
answer
shall
i
make
clearchus
returned
answer
once
again
in
the
same
words
truce
if
we
stop
but
if
we
move
forwards
or
backwards
war
but
what
he
was
minded
really
to
do
that
he
refused
to
make
further
manifest
ii
phalinus
and
those
that
were
with
him
turned
and
went
but
the
messengers
from
ariaeus
procles
and
cheirisophus
came
back
as
to
menon
he
stayed
behind
with
ariaeus
they
brought
back
this
answer
from
ariaeus
are
many
persians
he
says
than
himself
who
will
not
suffer
him
to
sit
upon
the
king
throne
but
if
you
are
minded
to
go
back
with
him
you
must
join
him
this
very
night
otherwise
he
will
set
off
himself
on
the
homeward
route
and
clearchus
said
it
had
best
stand
thus
between
us
then
if
we
come
well
and
good
be
it
as
you
propose
but
if
we
do
not
come
do
whatsoever
you
think
most
conducive
to
your
interests
and
so
he
kept
these
also
in
the
dark
as
to
his
real
intention
after
this
when
the
sun
was
already
sinking
he
summoned
the
generals
and
officers
and
made
the
following
statement
sirs
i
sacrificed
and
found
the
victims
unfavourable
to
an
advance
against
the
king
after
all
it
is
not
so
surprising
perhaps
for
as
i
now
learn
between
us
and
the
king
flows
the
river
tigris
navigable
for
big
vessels
and
we
could
not
possibly
cross
it
without
boats
and
boats
we
have
none
on
the
other
hand
to
stop
here
is
out
of
the
question
for
there
is
no
possibility
of
getting
provisions
however
the
victims
were
quite
agreeable
to
us
joining
the
friends
of
cyrus
this
is
what
we
must
do
then
let
each
go
away
and
sup
on
whatever
he
has
at
the
first
sound
of
the
bugle
to
turn
in
get
kit
and
baggage
together
at
the
second
signal
place
them
on
the
baggage
animals
and
at
the
third
fall
in
and
follow
the
lead
with
the
baggage
animals
on
the
inside
protected
by
the
river
and
the
troops
outside
after
hearing
the
orders
the
generals
and
officers
retired
and
did
as
they
were
bid
and
for
the
future
clearchus
led
and
the
rest
followed
in
obedience
to
his
orders
not
that
they
had
expressly
chosen
him
but
they
saw
that
he
alone
had
the
sense
and
wisdom
requisite
in
a
general
while
the
rest
were
inexperienced
the
mss
add
the
words
the
total
distance
of
the
route
taking
ephesus
in
ionia
as
the
starting
point
up
to
the
field
of
battle
consisted
of
stages
parasangs
or
furlongs
from
the
to
babylon
reckoned
a
three
days
journey
would
have
been
another
stades
which
may
well
be
an
editor
or
commentator
marginal
note
here
under
cover
of
the
darkness
which
descended
the
thracian
miltocythes
with
forty
horsemen
and
three
hundred
thracian
infantry
deserted
to
the
king
but
the
rest
of
the
troops
clearchus
leading
and
the
rest
following
in
accordance
with
the
orders
promulgated
took
their
departure
and
about
midnight
reached
their
first
stage
having
come
up
with
ariaeus
and
his
army
they
grounded
arms
just
as
they
stood
in
rank
and
the
generals
and
officers
of
the
hellenes
met
in
the
tent
of
ariaeus
there
they
exchanged
oaths
the
hellenes
on
the
one
side
and
ariaeus
with
his
principal
officers
on
the
other
not
to
betray
one
another
but
to
be
true
to
each
other
as
allies
the
asiatics
further
solemnly
pledged
themselves
by
oath
to
lead
the
way
without
treachery
the
oaths
were
ratified
by
the
sacrifice
of
a
bull
a
wolf
a
boar
and
a
ram
over
a
shield
the
hellenes
dipped
a
sword
the
barbarians
a
lance
into
the
blood
of
the
victims
it
is
a
question
whether
the
words
a
wolf
ought
not
to
be
omitted
as
soon
as
the
pledge
was
taken
clearchus
spoke
and
now
ariaeus
he
said
since
you
and
we
have
one
expedition
in
prospect
will
you
tell
us
what
you
think
about
the
route
shall
we
return
the
way
we
came
or
have
you
devised
a
better
he
answered
to
return
the
same
way
is
to
perish
to
a
man
by
hunger
for
at
this
moment
we
have
no
provisions
whatsoever
during
the
seventeen
last
stages
even
on
our
way
hither
we
could
extract
nothing
from
the
country
or
if
there
was
now
and
again
anything
we
passed
over
and
utterly
consumed
it
at
this
time
our
project
is
to
take
another
and
a
longer
journey
certainly
but
we
shall
not
be
in
straits
for
provisions
the
earliest
stages
must
be
very
long
as
long
as
we
can
make
them
the
object
is
to
put
as
large
a
space
as
possible
between
us
and
the
royal
army
once
we
are
two
or
three
days
journey
off
the
danger
is
over
the
king
will
never
overtake
us
with
a
small
army
he
will
not
dare
to
dog
our
heels
and
with
a
vast
equipment
he
will
lack
the
power
to
march
quickly
perhaps
he
too
may
even
find
a
scarcity
of
provisions
there
said
he
you
asked
for
my
opinion
see
i
have
given
it
here
was
a
plan
of
the
campaign
which
was
equivalent
to
a
stampede
they
were
to
run
away
or
get
into
hiding
somehow
but
fortune
proved
a
better
general
for
as
soon
as
it
was
day
they
recommenced
the
journey
keeping
the
sun
on
their
right
and
calculating
that
with
the
westering
rays
they
would
have
reached
villages
in
the
territory
of
babylonia
and
in
this
hope
they
were
not
deceived
while
it
was
yet
afternoon
they
thought
they
caught
sight
of
some
of
the
enemy
cavalry
and
those
of
the
hellenes
who
were
not
in
rank
ran
to
their
ranks
and
ariaeus
who
was
riding
in
a
wagon
to
nurse
a
wound
got
down
and
donned
his
cuirass
the
rest
of
his
party
following
his
example
whilst
they
were
arming
themselves
the
scouts
who
had
been
sent
forward
came
back
with
the
information
that
they
were
not
cavalry
but
baggage
animals
grazing
it
was
at
once
clear
to
all
that
they
must
be
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
encampment
smoke
could
actually
be
seen
rising
evidently
from
villages
not
far
ahead
clearchus
hesitated
to
advance
upon
the
enemy
knowing
that
the
troops
were
tired
and
hungry
and
indeed
it
was
already
late
on
the
other
hand
he
had
no
mind
either
to
swerve
from
his
route
guarding
against
any
appearance
of
flight
accordingly
he
marched
straight
as
an
arrow
and
with
sunset
entered
the
nearest
villages
with
his
vanguard
and
took
up
quarters
these
villages
had
been
thoroughly
sacked
and
dismantled
by
the
royal
army
down
to
the
very
woodwork
and
furniture
of
the
houses
still
the
vanguard
contrived
to
take
up
their
quarters
in
some
sort
of
fashion
but
the
rear
division
coming
up
in
the
dark
had
to
bivouac
as
best
they
could
one
detachment
after
another
and
a
great
noise
they
made
with
hue
and
cry
to
one
another
so
that
the
enemy
could
hear
them
and
those
in
their
immediate
proximity
actually
took
to
their
heels
left
their
quarters
and
decamped
as
was
plain
enough
next
morning
when
not
a
beast
was
to
be
seen
nor
sign
of
camp
or
wreath
of
smoke
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
the
king
as
it
would
appear
was
himself
quite
taken
aback
by
the
advent
of
the
army
as
he
fully
showed
by
his
proceedings
next
day
during
the
progress
of
this
night
the
hellenes
had
their
turn
of
scare
a
panic
seized
them
and
there
was
a
noise
and
clatter
hardly
to
be
explained
except
by
the
visitation
of
some
sudden
terror
but
clearchus
had
with
him
the
eleian
tolmides
the
best
herald
of
his
time
him
he
ordered
to
proclaim
silence
and
then
to
give
out
this
proclamation
of
the
generals
whoever
will
give
any
information
as
to
who
let
an
ass
into
the
camp
shall
receive
a
talent
of
silver
in
reward
on
hearing
this
proclamation
the
soldiers
made
up
their
minds
that
their
fear
was
baseless
and
their
generals
safe
and
sound
at
break
of
day
clearchus
gave
the
order
to
the
hellenes
to
get
under
arms
in
line
of
battle
and
take
up
exactly
the
same
position
as
they
held
on
the
day
of
the
battle
iii
and
now
comes
the
proof
of
what
i
stated
above
that
the
king
was
utterly
taken
aback
by
the
sudden
apparition
of
the
army
only
the
day
before
he
had
sent
and
demanded
the
surrender
of
their
arms
and
now
with
the
rising
sun
came
heralds
sent
by
him
to
arrange
a
truce
these
having
reached
the
advanced
guard
asked
for
the
generals
the
guard
reported
their
arrival
and
clearchus
who
was
busy
inspecting
the
ranks
sent
back
word
to
the
heralds
that
they
must
await
his
leisure
having
carefully
arranged
the
troops
so
that
from
every
side
they
might
present
the
appearance
of
a
compact
battle
line
without
a
single
unarmed
man
in
sight
he
summoned
the
ambassadors
and
himself
went
forward
to
meet
them
with
the
soldiers
who
for
choice
accoutrement
and
noble
aspect
were
the
flower
of
his
force
a
course
which
he
had
invited
the
other
generals
also
to
adopt
and
now
being
face
to
face
with
the
ambassadors
he
questioned
them
as
to
what
their
wishes
were
they
replied
that
they
had
come
to
arrange
a
truce
and
were
persons
competent
to
carry
proposals
from
the
king
to
the
hellenes
and
from
the
hellenes
to
the
king
he
returned
answer
to
them
take
back
word
then
to
your
master
that
we
need
a
battle
first
for
we
have
had
no
breakfast
and
he
will
be
a
brave
man
who
will
dare
mention
the
word
to
hellenes
without
providing
them
with
breakfast
with
this
message
the
heralds
rode
off
but
were
back
again
in
no
time
which
was
a
proof
that
the
king
or
some
one
appointed
by
him
to
transact
the
business
was
hard
by
they
reported
that
the
message
seemed
reasonable
to
the
king
they
had
now
come
bringing
guides
who
if
a
truce
were
arranged
would
conduct
them
where
they
would
get
provisions
clearchus
inquired
whether
the
truce
was
offered
to
the
individual
men
merely
as
they
went
and
came
or
to
all
alike
to
all
they
replied
until
the
king
receives
your
final
answer
when
they
had
so
spoken
clearchus
having
removed
the
ambassadors
held
a
council
and
it
was
resolved
to
make
a
truce
at
once
and
then
quietly
to
go
and
secure
provisions
and
clearchus
said
i
agree
to
the
resolution
still
i
do
not
propose
to
announce
it
at
once
but
to
wile
away
time
till
the
ambassadors
begin
to
fear
that
we
have
decided
against
the
truce
though
i
suspect
he
added
the
same
fear
will
be
operative
on
the
minds
of
our
soldiers
also
as
soon
as
the
right
moment
seemed
to
have
arrived
he
delivered
his
answer
in
favour
of
the
truce
and
bade
the
ambassadors
at
once
conduct
them
to
the
provisions
so
these
led
the
way
and
clearchus
without
relaxing
precaution
in
spite
of
having
secured
a
truce
marched
after
them
with
his
army
in
line
and
himself
in
command
of
the
rearguard
over
and
over
again
they
encountered
trenches
and
conduits
so
full
of
water
that
they
could
not
be
crossed
without
bridges
but
they
contrived
well
enough
for
these
by
means
of
trunks
of
palm
trees
which
had
fallen
or
which
they
cut
down
for
the
occasion
and
here
clearchus
system
of
superintendence
was
a
study
in
itself
as
he
stood
with
a
spear
in
his
left
hand
and
a
stick
in
the
other
and
when
it
seemed
to
him
there
was
any
dawdling
among
the
parties
told
off
to
the
work
he
would
pick
out
the
right
man
and
down
would
come
the
stick
nor
at
the
same
time
was
he
above
plunging
into
the
mud
and
lending
a
hand
himself
so
that
every
one
else
was
forced
for
very
shame
to
display
equal
alacrity
the
men
told
off
for
the
business
were
the
men
of
thirty
years
of
age
but
even
the
elder
men
when
they
saw
the
energy
of
clearchus
could
not
resist
lending
their
aid
also
what
stimulated
the
haste
of
clearchus
was
the
suspicion
in
his
mind
that
these
trenches
were
not
as
a
rule
so
full
of
water
since
it
was
not
the
season
to
irrigate
the
plain
and
he
fancied
that
the
king
had
let
the
water
on
for
the
express
purpose
of
vividly
presenting
to
the
hellenes
the
many
dangers
with
which
their
march
was
threatened
at
the
very
start
proceeding
on
their
way
they
reached
some
villages
where
their
guides
indicated
to
them
that
they
would
find
provisions
they
were
found
to
contain
plenty
of
corn
and
wine
made
from
palm
dates
and
an
acidulated
beverage
extracted
by
boiling
from
the
same
fruit
as
to
the
palm
nuts
or
dates
themselves
it
was
noticeable
that
the
sort
which
we
are
accustomed
to
see
in
hellas
were
set
aside
for
the
domestic
servants
those
put
aside
for
the
masters
are
picked
specimens
and
are
simply
marvellous
for
their
beauty
and
size
looking
like
great
golden
lumps
of
amber
some
specimens
they
dried
and
preserved
as
sweetmeats
sweet
enough
they
were
as
an
accompaniment
of
wine
but
apt
to
give
headache
here
too
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
the
men
tasted
the
brain
of
the
palm
no
one
could
help
being
struck
by
the
beauty
of
this
object
and
the
peculiarity
of
its
delicious
flavour
but
this
like
the
dried
fruits
was
exceedingly
apt
to
give
headache
when
this
cabbage
or
brain
has
been
removed
from
the
palm
the
whole
tree
withers
from
top
to
bottom
the
crown
in
these
villages
they
remained
three
days
and
a
deputation
from
the
great
king
arrived
tissaphernes
and
the
king
and
three
other
persians
with
a
retinue
of
many
slaves
as
soon
as
the
generals
of
the
hellenes
had
presented
themselves
tissaphernes
opened
the
proceedings
with
the
following
speech
through
the
lips
of
an
interpreter
men
of
hellas
i
am
your
neighbour
in
hellas
therefore
was
it
that
i
when
i
saw
into
what
a
sea
of
troubles
you
were
fallen
regarded
it
as
a
godsend
if
by
any
means
i
might
obtain
as
a
boon
from
the
king
the
privilege
of
bringing
you
back
in
safety
to
your
own
country
and
that
i
take
it
will
earn
me
gratitude
from
you
and
all
hellas
in
this
determination
i
preferred
my
request
to
the
king
i
claimed
it
as
a
favour
which
was
fairly
my
due
for
was
it
not
i
who
first
announced
to
him
the
hostile
approach
of
cyrus
who
supported
that
announcement
by
the
aid
i
brought
who
alone
among
the
officers
confronted
with
the
hellenes
in
battle
did
not
flee
but
charged
right
through
and
united
my
troops
with
the
king
inside
your
camp
where
he
was
arrived
having
slain
cyrus
it
was
i
lastly
who
gave
chase
to
the
barbarians
under
cyrus
with
the
help
of
those
here
present
with
me
at
this
moment
which
are
also
among
the
trustiest
followers
of
our
lord
the
king
now
i
counsel
you
to
give
a
moderate
answer
so
that
it
may
be
easier
for
me
to
carry
out
my
design
if
haply
i
may
obtain
from
him
some
good
thing
on
your
behalf
thereupon
the
hellenes
retired
and
took
counsel
then
they
answered
and
clearchus
was
their
spokesman
we
neither
mustered
as
a
body
to
make
war
against
the
king
nor
was
our
march
conducted
with
that
object
but
it
was
cyrus
as
you
know
who
invented
many
and
divers
pretexts
that
he
might
take
you
off
your
guard
and
transport
us
hither
yet
after
a
while
when
we
saw
that
he
was
in
sore
straits
we
were
ashamed
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
to
betray
him
whom
we
had
permitted
for
so
long
a
season
to
benefit
us
but
now
that
cyrus
is
dead
we
set
up
no
claim
to
his
kingdom
against
the
king
himself
there
is
neither
person
nor
thing
for
the
sake
of
which
we
would
care
to
injure
the
king
country
we
would
not
choose
to
kill
him
if
we
could
rather
we
would
march
straight
home
if
we
were
not
molested
but
god
helping
us
we
will
retaliate
on
all
who
injure
us
on
the
other
hand
if
any
be
found
to
benefit
us
we
do
not
mean
to
be
outdone
in
kindly
deeds
as
far
as
in
us
lies
so
he
spoke
and
tissaphernes
listened
and
replied
that
answer
will
i
take
back
to
the
king
and
bring
you
word
from
him
again
until
i
come
again
let
the
truce
continue
and
we
will
furnish
you
with
a
market
all
next
day
he
did
not
come
back
and
the
hellenes
were
troubled
with
anxieties
but
on
the
third
day
he
arrived
with
the
news
that
he
had
obtained
from
the
king
the
boon
he
asked
he
was
permitted
to
save
the
hellenes
though
there
were
many
gainsayers
who
argued
that
it
was
not
seemly
for
the
king
to
let
those
who
had
marched
against
him
depart
in
peace
and
at
last
he
said
you
may
now
if
you
like
take
pledges
from
us
that
we
will
make
the
countries
through
which
you
pass
friendly
to
you
and
will
lead
you
back
without
treachery
into
hellas
and
will
furnish
you
with
a
market
and
wherever
you
can
not
purchase
we
will
permit
you
to
take
provisions
from
the
district
you
on
your
side
must
swear
that
you
will
march
as
through
a
friendly
country
without
damage
merely
taking
food
and
drink
wherever
we
fail
to
supply
a
market
or
if
we
afford
a
market
you
shall
only
obtain
provisions
by
paying
for
them
this
was
agreed
to
and
oaths
and
pledges
exchanged
between
them
tissaphernes
and
the
king
upon
the
one
side
and
the
generals
and
officers
of
the
hellenes
on
the
other
after
this
tissaphernes
said
and
now
i
go
back
to
the
king
as
soon
as
i
have
transacted
what
i
have
a
mind
to
i
will
come
back
ready
equipped
to
lead
you
away
to
hellas
and
to
return
myself
to
my
own
dominion
iv
after
these
things
the
hellenes
and
ariaeus
waited
for
tissaphernes
being
encamped
close
to
one
another
for
more
than
twenty
days
they
waited
during
which
time
there
came
visitors
to
ariaeus
his
brother
and
other
kinsfolk
to
those
under
him
came
certain
other
persians
encouraging
them
and
bearing
pledges
to
some
of
them
from
the
king
himself
that
he
would
bear
no
grudge
against
them
on
account
of
the
part
they
bore
in
the
expedition
against
him
with
cyrus
or
for
aught
else
of
the
things
which
were
past
whilst
these
overtures
were
being
made
ariaeus
and
his
friends
gave
manifest
signs
of
paying
less
attention
to
the
hellenes
so
much
so
that
if
for
no
other
reason
the
majority
of
the
latter
were
not
well
pleased
and
they
came
to
clearchus
and
the
other
generals
asking
what
they
were
waiting
for
do
we
not
know
full
well
they
said
that
the
king
would
give
a
great
deal
to
destroy
us
so
that
other
hellenes
may
take
warning
and
think
twice
before
they
march
against
the
king
it
suits
his
purpose
to
induce
us
to
stop
here
because
his
army
is
scattered
but
as
soon
as
he
has
got
together
another
armament
attack
us
most
certainly
he
will
how
do
we
know
he
is
not
at
this
moment
digging
away
at
trenches
or
running
up
walls
to
make
our
path
impassable
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
will
desire
us
to
return
to
hellas
with
a
tale
how
a
handful
of
men
like
ourselves
beat
the
king
at
his
own
gates
laughed
him
to
scorn
and
then
came
home
again
clearchus
replied
i
too
am
keenly
aware
of
all
this
but
i
reason
thus
if
we
turn
our
backs
now
they
will
say
we
mean
war
and
are
acting
contrary
to
the
truce
and
then
what
follows
first
of
all
no
one
will
furnish
us
with
a
market
or
means
of
providing
ourselves
with
food
next
we
shall
have
no
one
to
guide
us
moreover
such
action
on
our
part
will
be
a
signal
to
ariaeus
to
hold
aloof
from
us
so
that
not
a
friend
will
be
left
to
us
even
those
who
were
formerly
our
friends
will
now
be
numbered
with
our
enemies
what
other
river
or
rivers
we
may
find
we
have
to
cross
i
do
not
know
but
this
we
know
to
cross
the
euphrates
in
face
of
resistance
is
impossible
you
see
in
the
event
of
being
driven
to
an
engagement
we
have
no
cavalry
to
help
us
but
with
the
enemy
it
is
the
reverse
not
only
the
most
but
the
best
of
his
troops
are
cavalry
so
that
if
we
are
victorious
we
shall
kill
no
one
but
if
we
are
defeated
not
a
man
of
us
can
escape
for
my
part
i
can
not
see
why
the
king
who
has
so
many
advantages
on
his
side
if
he
desires
to
destroy
us
should
swear
oaths
and
tender
solemn
pledges
merely
in
order
to
perjure
himself
in
the
sight
of
heaven
to
render
his
word
worthless
and
his
credit
discreditable
the
wide
world
over
these
arguments
he
propounded
at
length
meanwhile
tissaphernes
came
back
apparently
ready
to
return
home
he
had
his
own
force
with
him
and
so
had
orontas
who
was
also
present
his
the
latter
brought
moreover
his
bride
with
him
the
daughter
whom
he
had
just
wedded
the
journey
was
now
at
length
fairly
commenced
tissaphernes
led
the
way
and
provided
a
market
they
advanced
and
ariaeus
advanced
too
at
the
head
of
asiatic
troops
side
by
side
with
tissaphernes
and
orontas
and
with
these
two
he
also
pitched
his
camp
the
hellenes
holding
them
in
suspicion
marched
separately
with
the
guides
and
they
encamped
on
each
occasion
a
parasang
apart
or
rather
less
and
both
parties
kept
watch
upon
each
other
as
if
they
were
enemies
which
hardly
tended
to
lull
suspicion
and
sometimes
whilst
foraging
for
wood
and
grass
and
so
forth
on
the
same
ground
blows
were
exchanged
which
occasioned
further
embitterments
three
stages
they
had
accomplished
ere
they
reached
the
wall
of
media
as
it
is
called
and
passed
within
it
it
was
built
of
baked
bricks
laid
upon
bitumen
it
was
twenty
feet
broad
and
a
hundred
feet
high
and
the
length
of
it
was
said
to
be
twenty
parasangs
it
lies
at
no
great
distance
from
babylon
from
this
point
they
marched
two
stages
eight
parasangs
and
crossed
two
canals
the
first
by
a
regular
bridge
the
other
spanned
by
a
bridge
of
seven
boats
these
canals
issued
from
the
tigris
and
from
them
a
whole
system
of
minor
trenches
was
cut
leading
over
the
country
large
ones
to
begin
with
and
then
smaller
and
smaller
till
at
last
they
become
the
merest
runnels
like
those
in
hellas
used
for
watering
millet
fields
they
reached
the
river
tigris
at
this
point
there
was
a
large
and
thickly
populated
city
named
sittace
at
a
distance
of
fifteen
furlongs
from
the
river
the
hellenes
accordingly
encamped
by
the
side
of
that
city
near
a
large
and
beautiful
park
which
was
thick
with
all
sorts
of
trees
the
asiatics
had
crossed
the
tigris
but
somehow
were
entirely
hidden
from
view
after
supper
proxenus
and
xenophon
were
walking
in
front
of
the
place
when
a
man
came
up
and
demanded
of
the
advanced
guard
where
he
could
find
proxenus
or
clearchus
he
did
not
ask
for
menon
and
that
too
though
he
came
from
ariaeus
who
was
friend
as
soon
as
proxenus
had
said
i
am
he
whom
you
seek
the
man
replied
i
have
been
sent
by
ariaeus
and
artaozus
who
have
been
trusty
friends
to
cyrus
in
past
days
and
are
your
they
warn
you
to
be
on
your
guard
in
case
the
barbarians
attack
you
in
the
night
there
is
a
large
body
of
troops
in
the
neighbouring
park
they
also
warn
you
to
send
and
occupy
the
bridge
over
the
tigris
since
tissaphernes
is
minded
to
break
it
down
in
the
night
if
he
can
so
that
you
may
not
cross
but
be
caught
between
the
river
and
the
canal
on
hearing
this
they
took
the
man
to
clearchus
and
acquainted
him
with
his
statement
clearchus
on
his
side
was
much
disturbed
and
indeed
alarmed
at
the
news
but
a
young
fellow
who
was
present
struck
with
an
idea
suggested
that
the
two
statements
were
inconsistent
as
to
the
contemplated
attack
and
the
proposed
destruction
of
the
bridge
clearly
the
attacking
party
must
either
conquer
or
be
worsted
if
they
conquer
what
need
of
their
breaking
down
the
bridge
why
if
there
were
half
a
dozen
bridges
said
he
we
should
not
be
any
the
more
able
to
save
ourselves
by
flight
there
would
be
no
place
to
flee
to
but
in
the
opposite
case
suppose
we
win
with
the
bridge
broken
down
it
is
they
who
will
not
be
able
to
save
themselves
by
flight
and
what
is
worse
for
them
not
a
single
soul
will
be
able
to
bring
them
succour
from
the
other
side
for
all
their
numbers
since
the
bridge
will
be
broken
down
possibly
xenophon
himself
clearchus
listened
to
the
reasoning
and
then
he
asked
the
messenger
how
large
the
country
between
the
tigris
and
the
canal
might
be
a
large
district
he
replied
and
in
it
are
villages
and
cities
numerous
and
large
then
it
dawned
upon
them
the
barbarians
had
sent
the
man
with
subtlety
in
fear
lest
the
hellenes
should
cut
the
bridge
and
occupy
the
island
territory
with
the
strong
defences
of
the
tigris
on
the
one
side
and
of
the
canal
on
the
other
supplying
themselves
with
provisions
from
the
country
so
included
large
and
rich
as
it
was
with
no
lack
of
hands
to
till
it
in
addition
to
which
a
harbour
of
refuge
and
asylum
would
be
found
for
any
one
who
was
minded
to
do
the
king
a
mischief
after
this
they
retired
to
rest
in
peace
not
however
neglecting
to
send
a
guard
to
occupy
the
bridge
in
spite
of
all
and
there
was
no
attack
from
any
quarter
whatsoever
nor
did
any
of
the
enemy
people
approach
the
bridges
so
the
guards
were
able
to
report
next
morning
but
as
soon
as
it
was
morning
they
proceeded
to
cross
the
bridge
which
consisted
of
vessels
and
in
so
doing
they
used
the
utmost
precaution
possible
for
reports
were
brought
by
some
of
the
hellenes
with
tissaphernes
that
an
attempt
was
to
be
made
to
attack
them
while
crossing
all
this
turned
out
to
be
false
though
it
is
true
that
while
crossing
they
did
catch
sight
of
glus
watching
with
some
others
to
see
if
they
crossed
the
river
but
as
soon
as
he
had
satisfied
himself
on
that
point
he
rode
off
and
was
gone
from
the
river
tigris
they
advanced
four
stages
twenty
parasangs
to
the
river
physcus
which
is
a
hundred
feet
broad
and
spanned
by
a
bridge
here
lay
a
large
and
populous
city
named
opis
close
to
which
the
hellenes
were
encountered
by
the
natural
brother
of
cyrus
and
artaxerxes
who
was
leading
a
large
army
from
susa
and
ecbatana
to
assist
the
king
he
halted
his
troops
and
watched
the
helleens
march
past
clearchus
led
them
in
column
two
abreast
and
from
time
to
time
the
vanguard
came
to
a
standstill
just
so
often
and
just
so
long
the
effect
repeated
itself
down
to
the
hindmost
man
halt
halt
halt
along
the
whole
line
so
that
even
to
the
hellenes
themselves
their
army
seemed
enormous
and
the
persian
was
fairly
astonished
at
the
spectacle
from
this
place
they
marched
through
media
six
desert
stages
thirty
parasangs
to
the
villages
of
parysatis
cyrus
and
the
mother
these
tissaphernes
in
mockery
of
cyrus
delivered
over
to
the
hellenes
to
plunder
except
that
the
folk
in
them
were
not
to
be
made
slaves
they
contained
much
corn
cattle
and
other
property
from
this
place
they
advanced
four
desert
stages
twenty
parasangs
keeping
the
tigris
on
the
left
on
the
first
of
these
stages
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
lay
a
large
city
it
was
a
place
named
caenae
from
which
the
natives
used
to
carry
across
loaves
and
cheeses
and
wine
on
rafts
made
of
skins
v
after
this
they
reached
the
river
zapatas
which
is
four
hundred
feet
broad
and
here
they
halted
three
days
during
the
interval
suspicions
were
rife
though
no
act
of
treachery
displayed
itself
clearchus
accordingly
resolved
to
bring
to
an
end
these
feelings
of
mistrust
before
they
led
to
war
consequently
he
sent
a
messenger
to
the
persian
to
say
that
he
desired
an
interview
with
him
to
which
the
other
readily
consented
as
soon
as
they
were
met
clearchus
spoke
as
follows
tissaphernes
he
said
i
do
not
forget
that
oaths
have
been
exchanged
between
us
and
right
hands
shaken
in
token
that
we
will
abstain
from
mutual
injury
but
i
can
see
that
you
watch
us
narrowly
as
if
we
were
foes
and
we
seeing
this
watch
you
narrowly
in
return
but
as
i
fail
to
discover
after
investigation
that
you
are
endeavouring
to
do
us
a
mischief
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
nothing
of
the
sort
has
ever
entered
our
heads
with
regard
to
you
the
best
plan
seemed
to
me
to
come
and
talk
the
matter
over
with
you
so
that
if
possible
we
might
dispel
the
mutual
distrust
on
either
side
for
i
have
known
people
ere
now
the
victims
in
some
cases
of
calumny
or
possibly
of
mere
suspicion
who
in
apprehension
of
one
another
and
eager
to
deal
the
first
blow
have
committed
irreparable
wrong
against
those
who
neither
intended
nor
so
much
as
harboured
a
thought
of
mischief
against
them
i
have
come
to
you
under
a
conviction
that
such
misunderstandings
may
best
be
put
a
stop
to
by
personal
intercourse
and
i
wish
to
instruct
you
plainly
that
you
are
wrong
in
mistrusting
us
the
first
and
weightiest
reason
is
that
the
oaths
which
we
took
in
the
sight
of
heaven
are
a
barrier
to
mutual
hostility
i
envy
not
the
man
whose
conscience
tells
him
that
he
has
disregarded
these
for
in
a
war
with
heaven
by
what
swiftness
of
foot
can
a
man
escape
in
what
quarter
find
refuge
in
what
darkness
slink
away
and
be
hid
to
what
strong
fortress
scale
and
be
out
of
reach
are
not
all
things
in
all
ways
subject
to
the
gods
is
not
their
lordship
over
all
alike
outspread
as
touching
the
gods
therefore
and
our
oaths
that
is
how
i
view
this
matter
to
their
safe
keeping
we
consigned
the
friendship
which
we
solemnly
contracted
but
turning
to
matters
human
you
i
look
upon
as
our
greatest
blessing
in
this
present
time
with
you
every
path
is
plain
to
us
every
river
passable
and
of
provisions
we
shall
know
no
stint
but
without
you
all
our
way
is
through
darkness
for
we
known
nothing
concerning
it
every
river
will
be
an
obstacle
each
multitude
a
terror
but
worst
terror
of
all
the
vast
wilderness
so
full
of
endless
perplexity
nay
if
in
a
fit
of
madness
we
murdered
you
what
then
in
slaying
our
benefactor
should
we
not
have
challenged
to
enter
the
lists
against
us
a
more
formidable
antagonist
in
the
king
himself
let
me
tell
you
how
many
high
hopes
i
should
rob
myself
of
were
i
to
take
in
hand
to
do
you
mischief
the
greater
zab
which
flows
into
the
tigris
near
a
town
now
called
senn
with
which
most
travellers
identify
caenae
i
coveted
the
friendship
of
cyrus
i
believed
him
to
be
abler
than
any
man
of
his
day
to
benefit
those
whom
he
chose
but
i
look
and
behold
it
is
you
who
are
in
his
place
the
power
which
belonged
to
cyrus
and
his
territory
are
yours
now
you
have
them
and
your
own
satrapy
besides
safe
and
sound
while
the
king
power
which
was
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
cyrus
is
your
support
this
being
so
it
would
be
madness
not
to
wish
to
be
your
friend
but
i
will
go
further
and
state
to
you
the
reasons
of
my
confidence
that
you
on
your
side
will
desire
our
friendship
i
know
that
the
mysians
are
a
cause
of
trouble
to
you
and
i
flatter
myself
that
with
my
present
force
i
could
render
them
humbly
obedient
to
you
this
applies
to
the
pisidians
also
and
i
am
told
there
are
many
other
such
tribes
besides
i
think
i
can
deal
with
them
all
they
shall
cease
from
being
a
constant
disturbance
to
your
peace
and
prosperity
then
there
are
the
egyptians
i
know
your
anger
against
them
is
very
great
nor
can
i
see
what
better
force
you
will
find
to
help
you
in
chastising
them
than
this
which
marches
at
my
back
again
if
you
seek
the
friendship
of
any
of
your
neighbours
round
there
shall
be
no
friend
so
great
as
you
if
any
one
annoys
you
with
us
as
your
faithful
servitors
you
shall
belord
it
over
him
and
such
service
we
will
render
you
not
as
hirelings
merely
for
pay
sake
but
for
the
gratitude
which
we
shall
rightly
feel
to
you
to
whom
we
owe
our
lives
as
i
dwell
on
these
matters
i
confess
the
idea
of
your
feeling
mistrust
of
us
is
so
astonishing
that
i
would
give
much
to
discover
the
name
of
the
man
who
is
so
clever
of
speech
that
he
can
persuade
you
that
we
harbour
designs
against
you
clearchus
ended
and
tissaphernes
responded
thus
we
learn
from
diodorus
siculus
xiv
that
the
egyptians
had
revolted
from
the
persians
towards
the
end
of
the
reign
of
darius
i
am
glad
clearchus
to
listen
to
your
sensible
remarks
for
with
the
sentiments
you
hold
if
you
were
to
devise
any
mischief
against
me
it
could
only
be
out
of
malevolence
to
yourself
but
if
you
imagine
that
you
on
your
side
have
any
better
reason
to
mistrust
the
king
and
me
than
we
you
listen
to
me
in
turn
and
i
will
undeceive
you
i
ask
you
does
it
seem
to
you
that
we
lack
the
means
if
we
had
the
will
to
destroy
you
have
we
not
horsemen
enough
or
infantry
or
whatever
other
arm
you
like
whereby
we
may
be
able
to
injure
you
without
risk
of
suffering
in
return
or
possibly
do
we
seem
to
you
to
lack
the
physical
surroundings
suitable
for
attacking
you
do
you
not
see
all
these
great
plains
which
you
find
it
hard
enough
to
traverse
even
when
they
are
friendly
and
all
yonder
great
mountain
chains
left
for
you
to
cross
which
we
can
at
any
time
occupy
in
advance
and
render
impassable
and
all
those
rivers
on
whose
banks
we
can
deal
craftily
by
you
checking
and
controlling
and
choosing
the
right
number
of
you
whom
we
care
to
fight
nay
there
are
some
which
you
will
not
be
able
to
cross
at
all
unless
we
transport
you
to
the
other
side
and
if
at
all
these
points
we
were
worsted
yet
as
they
say
stronger
than
the
fruit
of
the
field
we
can
burn
it
down
and
call
up
famine
in
arms
against
you
against
which
you
for
all
your
bravery
will
never
be
able
to
contend
why
then
with
all
these
avenues
of
attack
this
machinery
of
war
open
to
us
not
one
of
which
can
be
turned
against
ourselves
why
should
we
select
from
among
them
all
that
method
which
alone
in
the
sight
of
god
is
impious
and
of
man
abominable
surely
it
belongs
to
people
altogether
without
resources
who
are
helplessly
struggling
in
the
toils
of
fate
and
are
villains
to
boot
to
seek
accomplishment
of
their
desires
by
perjury
to
heaven
and
faithlessness
to
their
fellows
we
are
not
so
unreasoning
clearchus
nor
so
foolish
why
when
we
had
it
in
our
power
to
destroy
you
did
we
not
proceed
to
do
it
know
well
that
the
cause
of
this
was
nothing
less
than
my
passion
to
prove
myself
faithful
to
the
hellenes
and
that
as
cyrus
went
up
relying
on
a
foreign
force
attracted
by
payment
i
in
turn
might
go
down
strong
in
the
same
through
service
rendered
various
ways
in
which
you
hellenes
may
be
useful
to
me
you
yourself
have
mentioned
but
there
is
one
still
greater
it
is
the
great
privilege
alone
to
wear
the
tiara
upright
upon
his
head
yet
in
your
presence
it
may
be
given
to
another
mortal
to
wear
it
upright
here
upon
his
heart
throughout
this
speech
he
seemed
to
clearchus
to
be
speaking
the
truth
and
he
rejoined
then
are
not
those
worthy
of
the
worst
penalties
who
in
spite
of
all
that
exists
to
cement
our
friendship
endeavour
by
slander
to
make
us
enemies
even
so
replied
tissaphernes
and
if
your
generals
and
captains
care
to
come
in
some
open
and
public
way
i
will
name
to
you
those
who
tell
me
that
you
are
plotting
against
me
and
the
army
under
me
good
replied
clearchus
i
will
bring
all
and
i
will
show
you
on
my
side
the
source
from
which
i
derive
my
information
concerning
you
after
this
conversation
tissaphernes
with
kindliest
expression
invited
clearchus
to
remain
with
him
at
the
time
and
entertained
him
at
dinner
next
day
clearchus
returned
to
the
camp
and
made
no
secret
of
his
persuasion
that
he
at
any
rate
stood
high
in
the
affections
of
tissaphernes
and
he
reported
what
he
had
said
insisting
that
those
invited
ought
to
go
to
tissaphernes
and
that
any
hellene
convicted
of
calumnious
language
ought
to
be
punished
not
only
as
traitors
themselves
but
as
disaffected
to
their
the
slanderer
and
traducer
was
menon
so
at
any
rate
he
suspected
because
he
knew
that
he
had
had
meetings
with
tissaphernes
whilst
he
was
with
ariaeus
and
was
factiously
opposed
to
himself
plotting
how
to
win
over
the
whole
army
to
him
as
a
means
of
winning
the
good
graces
of
tissaphernes
but
clearchus
wanted
the
entire
army
to
give
its
mind
to
no
one
else
and
that
refractory
people
should
be
put
out
of
the
way
some
of
the
soldiers
protested
the
captains
and
generals
had
better
not
all
go
it
was
better
not
to
put
too
much
confidence
in
tissaphernes
but
clearchus
insisted
so
strongly
that
finally
it
was
arranged
for
five
generals
to
go
and
twenty
captains
these
were
accompanied
by
about
two
hundred
of
the
other
soldiers
who
took
the
opportunity
of
marketing
on
arrival
at
the
doors
of
tissaphernes
quarters
the
generals
were
summoned
inside
they
were
proxenus
the
boeotian
menon
the
thessalian
agias
the
arcadian
clearchus
the
laconian
and
socrates
the
achaean
while
the
captains
remained
at
the
doors
not
long
after
that
at
one
and
the
same
signal
those
within
were
seized
and
those
without
cut
down
after
which
some
of
the
barbarian
horsemen
galloped
over
the
plain
killing
every
hellene
they
encountered
bond
or
free
the
hellenes
as
they
looked
from
the
camp
viewed
that
strange
horsemanship
with
surprise
and
could
not
explain
to
themselves
what
it
all
meant
until
nicarchus
the
arcadian
came
tearing
along
for
bare
life
with
a
wound
in
the
belly
and
clutching
his
protruding
entrails
in
his
hands
he
told
them
all
that
had
happened
instantly
the
hellenes
ran
to
their
arms
one
and
all
in
utter
consternation
and
fully
expecting
that
the
enemy
would
instantly
be
down
upon
the
camp
however
they
did
not
all
come
only
ariaeus
came
and
artaozus
and
mithridates
who
were
cyrus
most
faithful
friends
but
the
interpreter
of
the
hellenes
said
he
saw
and
recognised
the
brother
of
tissaphernes
also
with
them
they
had
at
their
back
other
persians
also
armed
with
cuirasses
as
many
as
three
hundred
as
soon
as
they
were
within
a
short
distance
they
bade
any
general
or
captain
of
the
hellenes
who
might
be
there
to
approach
and
hear
a
message
from
the
king
after
this
two
hellene
generals
went
out
with
all
precaution
these
were
cleanor
the
orchomenian
and
sophaenetus
the
stymphalion
attended
by
xenophon
the
athenian
who
went
to
learn
news
of
proxenus
cheirisophus
was
at
the
time
away
in
a
village
with
a
party
gathering
provisions
as
soon
as
they
had
halted
within
earshot
ariaeus
said
hellenes
clearchus
being
shown
to
have
committed
perjury
and
to
have
broken
the
truce
has
suffered
the
penalty
and
he
is
dead
but
proxenus
and
menon
in
return
for
having
given
information
of
his
treachery
are
in
high
esteem
and
honour
as
to
yourselves
the
king
demands
your
arms
he
claims
them
as
his
since
they
belonged
to
cyrus
who
was
his
slave
to
this
the
hellenes
made
answer
by
the
mouth
of
cleanor
of
orchomenus
their
spokesman
who
said
addressing
ariaeus
thou
villain
ariaeus
and
you
the
rest
of
you
who
were
cyrus
friends
have
you
no
shame
before
god
or
man
first
to
swear
to
us
that
you
have
the
same
friends
and
the
same
enemies
as
we
ourselves
and
then
to
turn
and
betray
us
making
common
cause
with
tissaphernes
that
most
impious
and
villainous
of
men
with
him
you
have
murdered
the
very
men
to
whom
you
gave
your
solemn
word
and
oath
and
to
the
rest
of
us
turned
traitors
and
having
so
done
you
join
hand
with
our
enemies
to
come
against
us
ariaeus
answered
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
clearchus
has
been
known
for
some
time
to
harbour
designs
against
tissaphernes
and
orontas
and
all
of
us
who
side
with
them
taking
up
this
assertion
xenophon
said
well
then
granting
that
clearchus
broke
the
truce
contrary
to
our
oaths
he
has
his
deserts
for
perjurers
deserve
to
perish
but
where
are
proxenus
and
menon
our
generals
and
your
good
friends
and
benefactors
as
you
admit
send
them
back
to
us
surely
just
because
they
are
friends
of
both
parites
they
will
try
to
give
us
the
best
advice
for
you
and
for
us
at
this
the
asiatics
stood
discussing
with
one
another
for
a
long
while
and
then
they
went
away
without
vouchsafing
a
word
vi
the
generals
who
were
thus
seized
were
taken
up
to
the
king
and
there
decapitated
the
first
of
these
clearchus
was
a
thorough
soldier
and
a
true
lover
of
fighting
this
is
the
testimony
of
all
who
knew
him
intimately
as
long
as
the
war
between
the
lacedaemonians
and
athenians
lasted
he
could
find
occupation
at
home
but
after
the
peace
he
persuaded
his
own
city
that
the
thracians
were
injuring
the
hellenes
and
having
secured
his
object
set
sail
empowered
by
the
ephorate
to
make
war
upon
the
thracians
north
of
the
chersonese
and
perinthus
but
he
had
no
sooner
fairly
started
than
for
some
reason
or
other
the
ephors
changed
their
minds
and
endeavoured
to
bring
him
back
again
from
the
isthmus
thereupon
he
refused
further
obedience
and
went
off
with
sails
set
for
the
hellespont
in
consequence
he
was
condemned
to
death
by
the
spartan
authorities
for
disobedience
to
orders
and
now
finding
himself
an
exile
he
came
to
cyrus
working
on
the
feelings
of
that
prince
in
language
described
elsewhere
he
received
from
his
entertainer
a
present
of
ten
thousand
darics
having
got
this
money
he
did
not
sink
into
a
life
of
ease
and
indolence
but
collected
an
army
with
it
carried
on
war
against
the
thracians
and
conquered
them
in
battle
and
from
that
date
onwards
harried
and
plundered
them
with
war
incessantly
until
cyrus
wanted
his
army
whereupon
he
at
once
went
off
in
hopes
of
finding
another
sphere
of
warfare
in
his
company
these
i
take
it
were
the
characteristic
acts
of
a
man
whose
affections
are
set
on
warfare
when
it
is
open
to
him
to
enjoy
peace
with
honour
no
shame
no
injury
attached
still
he
prefers
war
when
he
may
live
at
home
at
ease
he
insists
on
toil
if
only
it
may
end
in
fighting
when
it
is
given
to
him
to
keep
his
riches
without
risk
he
would
rather
lessen
his
fortune
by
the
pastime
of
battle
to
put
it
briefly
war
was
his
mistress
just
as
another
man
will
spend
his
fortune
on
a
favourite
or
to
gratify
some
pleasure
so
he
chose
to
squander
his
substance
on
soldiering
but
if
the
life
of
a
soldier
was
a
passion
with
him
he
was
none
the
less
a
soldier
born
as
herein
appears
danger
was
a
delight
to
him
he
courted
it
attacking
the
enemy
by
night
or
by
day
and
in
difficulties
he
did
not
lose
his
head
as
all
who
ever
served
in
a
campaign
with
him
would
with
one
consent
allow
a
good
solder
the
question
arises
was
he
equally
good
as
a
commander
it
must
be
admitted
that
as
far
as
was
compatible
with
his
quality
of
temper
he
was
none
more
so
capable
to
a
singular
degree
of
devising
how
his
army
was
to
get
supplies
and
of
actually
getting
them
he
was
also
capable
of
impressing
upon
those
about
him
that
clearchus
must
be
obeyed
and
that
he
brought
about
by
the
very
hardness
of
his
nature
with
a
scowling
expression
and
a
voice
he
chastised
with
severity
and
at
times
with
such
fury
that
he
was
sorry
afterwards
himself
for
what
he
had
done
yet
it
was
not
without
purpose
that
he
applied
the
whip
he
had
a
theory
that
there
was
no
good
to
be
got
out
of
an
unchastened
army
a
saying
of
his
is
recorded
to
the
effect
that
the
soldier
who
is
to
mount
guard
and
keep
his
hands
off
his
friends
and
be
ready
to
dash
without
a
hesitation
against
the
foe
must
fear
his
commander
more
than
the
enemy
accordingly
in
any
strait
this
was
the
man
whom
the
soldiers
were
eager
to
obey
and
they
would
have
no
other
in
his
place
the
cloud
which
lay
upon
his
brow
at
those
times
lit
up
with
brightness
his
face
became
radiant
and
the
old
sternness
was
so
charged
with
vigour
and
knitted
strength
to
meet
the
foe
that
it
savoured
of
salvation
not
of
cruelty
but
when
the
pinch
of
danger
was
past
and
it
was
open
to
them
to
go
and
taste
subordination
under
some
other
officer
many
forsook
him
so
lacking
in
grace
of
manner
was
he
but
was
ever
harsh
and
savage
so
that
the
feeling
of
the
soldiers
towards
him
was
that
of
schoolboys
to
a
master
in
other
words
though
it
was
not
his
good
fortune
ever
to
have
followers
inspired
solely
by
friendship
or
goodwill
yet
those
who
found
themselves
under
him
either
by
state
appointment
or
through
want
or
other
arch
necessity
yielded
him
implicit
obedience
from
the
moment
that
he
led
them
to
victory
the
elements
which
went
to
make
his
soldiers
efficient
were
numerous
enough
there
was
the
feeling
of
confidence
in
facing
the
foe
which
never
left
them
and
there
was
the
dread
of
punishment
at
his
hands
to
keep
them
orderly
in
this
way
and
to
this
extent
he
knew
how
to
rule
but
to
play
a
subordinate
part
himself
he
had
no
great
taste
so
at
any
rate
it
was
said
at
the
time
of
his
death
he
must
have
been
about
fifty
years
of
age
proxenus
the
boeotian
was
of
a
different
temperament
it
had
been
the
dream
of
his
boyhood
to
become
a
man
capable
of
great
achievements
in
obedience
to
this
passionate
desire
it
was
that
he
paid
his
fee
to
gorgias
of
leontini
after
enojoying
that
society
he
flattered
himself
that
he
must
be
at
once
qualified
to
rule
and
while
he
was
on
friendly
terms
with
the
leaders
of
the
age
he
was
not
to
be
outdone
in
reciprocity
of
service
in
this
mood
he
threw
himself
into
the
projects
of
cyrus
and
in
return
expected
to
derive
from
this
essay
the
reward
of
a
great
name
large
power
and
wide
wealth
but
for
all
that
he
pitched
his
hopes
so
high
it
was
none
the
less
evident
that
he
would
refuse
to
gain
any
of
the
ends
he
set
before
him
wrongfully
righteously
and
honourably
he
would
obtain
them
if
he
might
or
else
forego
them
as
a
commander
he
had
the
art
of
leading
gentlemen
but
he
failed
to
inspire
adequately
either
respect
for
himself
or
fear
in
the
soldiers
under
him
indeed
he
showed
a
more
delicate
regard
for
his
soldiers
than
his
subordinates
for
him
and
he
was
indisputably
more
apprehensive
of
incurring
their
hatred
than
they
were
of
losing
their
fidelity
the
one
thing
needful
to
real
and
recognised
generalship
was
he
thought
to
praise
the
virtuous
and
to
withhold
praise
from
the
evildoer
it
can
be
easily
understood
then
that
of
those
who
were
brought
in
contact
with
him
the
good
and
noble
indeed
were
his
but
he
laid
himself
open
to
the
machinations
of
the
base
who
looked
upon
him
as
a
person
to
be
dealt
with
as
they
liked
at
the
time
of
his
death
he
was
only
thirty
years
of
age
the
famous
rhetorician
of
leontini
his
fee
was
minae
proxenus
like
cyrus
is
to
some
extent
a
prototype
of
the
cyrus
of
the
cyropaedia
in
other
words
the
author
in
delineating
the
portrait
of
his
ideal
prince
drew
from
the
recollection
of
many
princely
qualities
observed
by
him
in
the
characters
of
many
friends
apart
from
the
intrinsic
charm
of
the
story
the
anabasis
is
interesting
as
containing
the
raw
material
of
experience
and
reflection
which
this
young
scholar
or
philosopher
our
friend
the
author
will
one
day
turn
to
literary
account
as
to
menon
the
thessalian
the
mainspring
of
his
action
was
obvious
what
he
sought
after
insatiably
was
wealth
rule
he
sought
after
only
as
a
to
larger
spoils
honours
and
high
estate
he
craved
for
simply
that
he
might
extend
the
area
of
his
gains
and
if
he
studied
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
the
powerful
it
was
in
order
that
he
might
commit
wrong
with
impunity
the
shortest
road
to
the
achievement
of
his
desires
lay
he
thought
through
false
swearing
lying
and
cheating
for
in
his
vocabulary
simplicity
and
truth
were
synonyms
of
folly
natural
affection
he
clearly
entertained
for
nobody
if
he
called
a
man
his
friend
it
might
be
looked
upon
as
certain
that
he
was
bent
on
ensnaring
him
laughter
at
an
enemy
he
considered
out
of
place
but
his
whole
conversation
turned
upon
the
ridicule
of
his
associates
in
like
manner
the
possessions
of
his
foes
were
secure
from
his
designs
since
it
was
no
easy
task
he
thought
to
steal
from
people
on
their
guard
but
it
was
his
particular
good
fortune
to
have
discovered
how
easy
it
is
to
rob
a
friend
in
the
midst
of
his
security
if
it
were
a
perjured
person
or
a
wrongdoer
he
dreaded
him
as
well
armed
and
intrenched
but
the
honourable
and
the
he
tried
to
practise
on
regarding
them
as
weaklings
devoid
of
manhood
and
as
other
men
pride
themselves
on
piety
and
truth
and
righteousness
so
menon
prided
himself
on
a
capacity
for
fraud
on
the
fabrication
of
lies
on
the
mockery
and
scorn
of
friends
the
man
who
was
not
a
rogue
he
ever
looked
upon
as
only
half
educated
did
he
aspire
to
the
first
place
in
another
friendship
he
set
about
his
object
by
slandering
those
who
stood
nearest
to
him
in
affection
he
contrived
to
secure
the
obedience
of
his
solders
by
making
himself
an
accomplice
in
their
misdeeds
and
the
fluency
with
which
he
vaunted
his
own
capacity
and
readiness
for
enormous
guilt
was
a
sufficient
title
to
be
honoured
and
courted
by
them
or
if
any
one
stood
aloof
from
him
he
set
it
down
as
a
meritorious
act
of
kindness
on
his
part
that
during
their
intercourse
he
had
not
robbed
him
of
existence
for
a
less
repulsive
conception
of
menon
character
however
unhistorical
see
plato
meno
and
introduction
plato
vol
he
is
a
thessalian
alcibiades
rich
and
luxurious
a
spoilt
child
of
fortune
as
to
certain
obscure
charges
brought
against
his
character
these
may
certainly
be
fabrications
i
confine
myself
to
the
following
facts
which
are
known
to
all
he
was
in
the
bloom
of
youth
when
he
procured
from
aristippus
the
command
of
his
mercenaries
he
had
not
yet
lost
that
bloom
when
he
became
exceedingly
intimate
with
ariaeus
a
barbarian
whose
liking
for
fair
young
men
was
the
explanation
and
before
he
had
grown
a
beard
himself
he
had
contracted
a
similar
relationship
with
a
bearded
favourite
named
tharypas
when
his
were
put
to
death
on
the
plea
that
they
had
marched
with
cyrus
against
the
king
he
alone
although
he
had
shared
their
conduct
was
exempted
from
their
fate
but
after
their
deaths
the
vengeance
of
the
king
fell
upon
him
and
he
was
put
to
death
not
like
clearchus
and
the
others
by
what
would
appear
to
be
the
speediest
of
deaths
decapitation
but
as
report
says
he
lived
for
a
year
in
pain
and
disgrace
and
died
the
death
of
a
felon
agias
the
arcadian
and
socrates
the
achaean
were
both
among
the
sufferers
who
were
put
to
death
to
the
credit
be
it
said
of
both
no
one
ever
derided
either
as
cowardly
in
war
no
one
ever
had
a
fault
to
find
with
either
on
the
score
of
friendship
they
were
both
about
years
of
age
book
iii
in
the
preceding
pages
of
the
narrative
will
be
found
a
full
account
not
only
of
the
doings
of
the
hellenes
during
the
advance
of
cyrus
till
the
date
of
the
battle
but
of
the
incidents
which
befell
them
after
cyrus
death
at
the
commencement
of
the
retreat
while
in
company
with
tissaphernes
during
the
truce
i
after
the
generals
had
been
seized
and
the
captains
and
soldiers
who
formed
their
escort
had
been
killed
the
hellenes
lay
in
deep
perplexity
a
prey
to
painful
reflections
here
were
they
at
the
king
gates
and
on
every
side
environing
them
were
many
hostile
cities
and
tribes
of
men
who
was
there
now
to
furnish
them
with
a
market
separated
from
hellas
by
more
than
a
thousand
miles
they
had
not
even
a
guide
to
point
the
way
impassable
rivers
lay
athwart
their
homeward
route
and
hemmed
them
in
betrayed
even
by
the
asiatics
at
whose
side
they
had
marched
with
cyrus
to
the
attack
they
were
left
in
isolation
without
a
single
mounted
trooper
to
aid
them
in
pursuit
was
it
not
perfectly
plain
that
if
they
won
a
battle
their
enemies
would
escape
to
a
man
but
if
they
were
beaten
themselves
not
one
soul
of
them
would
survive
haunted
by
such
thoughts
and
with
hearts
full
of
despair
but
few
of
them
tasted
food
that
evening
but
few
of
them
kindled
even
a
fire
and
many
never
came
into
camp
at
all
that
night
but
took
their
rest
where
each
chanced
to
be
they
could
not
close
their
eyes
for
very
pain
and
yearning
after
their
fatherlands
or
their
parents
the
wife
or
child
whom
they
never
expected
to
look
upon
again
such
was
the
plight
in
which
each
and
all
tried
to
seek
repose
now
there
was
in
that
host
a
certain
man
an
athenian
xenophon
who
had
accompanied
cyrus
neither
as
a
general
nor
as
an
officer
nor
yet
as
a
private
soldier
but
simply
on
the
invitation
of
an
old
friend
proxenus
this
old
friend
had
sent
to
fetch
him
from
home
promising
if
he
would
come
to
introduce
him
to
cyrus
whom
said
proxenus
i
consider
to
be
worth
my
fatherland
and
more
to
me
the
reader
should
turn
to
grote
comments
on
the
first
appearance
of
xenophon
he
has
been
mentioned
before
of
course
more
than
once
before
but
he
now
steps
as
the
protagonist
upon
the
scene
and
as
grote
says
it
is
in
true
homeric
vein
and
in
something
like
homeric
language
that
xenophon
to
whom
we
owe
the
whole
narrative
of
the
expedition
describes
his
dream
or
the
intervention
of
oneiros
sent
by
zeus
from
which
this
renovating
impulse
took
its
rise
xenophon
having
read
the
letter
consulted
socrates
the
athenian
whether
he
should
accept
or
refuse
the
invitation
socrates
who
had
a
suspicion
that
the
state
of
athens
might
in
some
way
look
askance
at
my
friendship
with
cyrus
whose
zealous
with
the
lacedaemonians
against
athens
in
the
war
was
not
forgotten
advised
xenophon
to
go
to
delphi
and
there
to
consult
the
god
as
to
the
desirability
of
such
a
journey
xenophon
went
and
put
the
question
to
apollo
to
which
of
the
gods
he
must
pray
and
do
sacrifice
so
that
he
might
best
accomplish
his
intended
journey
and
return
in
safety
with
good
fortune
then
apollo
answered
him
to
such
and
such
gods
must
thou
do
sacrifice
and
when
he
had
returned
home
he
reported
to
socrates
the
oracle
but
he
when
he
heard
blamed
xenophon
that
he
had
not
in
the
first
instance
inquired
of
the
god
whether
it
were
better
for
him
to
go
or
to
stay
but
had
taken
on
himself
to
settle
that
point
affirmatively
by
inquiring
straightway
how
he
might
best
perform
the
journey
since
however
continued
socrates
you
did
so
put
the
question
you
should
do
what
the
god
enjoined
thus
and
without
further
ado
xenophon
offered
sacrifice
to
those
whom
the
god
had
named
and
set
sail
on
his
voyage
he
overtook
proxenus
and
cyrus
at
sardis
when
they
were
just
ready
to
start
on
the
march
up
country
and
was
at
once
introduced
to
cyrus
proxenus
eagerly
pressed
him
to
stop
a
request
which
cyrus
with
like
ardour
supported
adding
that
as
soon
as
the
campaign
was
over
he
would
send
him
home
the
campaign
referred
to
was
understood
to
be
against
the
pisidians
that
is
how
xenophon
came
to
join
the
expedition
deceived
indeed
though
not
by
proxenus
who
was
equally
in
the
dark
with
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
not
counting
clearchus
as
to
the
intended
attack
upon
the
king
then
though
the
majority
were
in
apprehension
of
the
journey
which
was
not
at
all
to
their
minds
yet
for
very
shame
of
one
another
and
cyrus
they
continued
to
follow
him
and
with
the
rest
went
xenophon
and
now
in
this
season
of
perplexity
he
too
with
the
rest
was
in
sore
distress
and
could
not
sleep
but
anon
getting
a
snatch
of
sleep
he
had
a
dream
it
seemed
to
him
in
a
vision
that
there
was
a
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
and
a
bolt
fell
on
his
father
house
and
thereupon
the
house
was
all
in
a
blaze
he
sprung
up
in
terror
and
pondering
the
matter
decided
that
in
part
the
dream
was
good
in
that
he
had
seen
a
great
light
from
zeus
whilst
in
the
midst
of
toil
and
danger
but
partly
too
he
feared
it
for
evidently
it
had
come
from
zeus
the
king
and
the
fire
kindled
all
around
what
could
that
mean
but
that
he
was
hemmed
in
by
various
perplexities
and
so
could
not
escape
from
the
country
of
the
king
the
full
meaning
however
is
to
be
discovered
from
what
happened
after
the
dream
this
is
what
took
place
as
soon
as
he
was
fully
awake
the
first
clear
thought
which
came
into
his
head
was
why
am
i
lying
here
the
night
advances
with
the
day
it
is
like
enough
the
enemy
will
be
upon
us
if
we
are
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
king
what
is
left
us
but
to
face
the
most
horrible
of
sights
and
to
suffer
the
most
fearful
pains
and
then
to
die
insulted
an
ignominious
death
to
defend
ourselves
to
ward
off
that
fate
not
a
hand
stirs
no
one
is
preparing
none
cares
but
here
we
lie
as
though
it
were
time
to
rest
and
take
our
ease
i
too
what
am
i
waiting
for
a
general
to
undertake
the
work
and
from
what
city
am
i
waiting
till
i
am
older
mysef
and
of
riper
age
older
i
shall
never
be
if
i
betray
myself
to
my
enemies
thereupon
he
got
up
and
called
together
first
proxenus
officers
and
when
they
were
met
he
said
sleep
sirs
i
can
not
nor
can
you
i
fancy
nor
lie
here
longer
when
i
see
in
what
straits
we
are
our
enemy
we
may
be
sure
did
not
open
war
upon
us
till
he
felt
he
had
everything
amply
ready
yet
none
of
us
shows
a
corresponding
anxiety
to
enter
the
lists
of
battle
in
the
bravest
style
and
yet
if
we
yield
ourselves
and
fall
into
the
king
power
need
we
ask
what
our
fate
will
be
this
man
who
when
his
own
brother
the
son
of
the
same
parents
was
dead
was
not
content
with
that
but
severed
head
and
hand
from
the
body
and
nailed
them
to
a
cross
we
then
who
have
not
even
the
tie
of
blood
in
our
favour
but
who
marched
against
him
meaning
to
make
a
slave
of
him
instead
of
a
king
and
to
slay
him
if
we
could
what
is
likely
to
be
our
fate
at
his
hands
will
he
not
go
all
lengths
so
that
by
inflicting
on
us
the
extreme
of
ignominy
and
torture
he
may
rouse
in
the
rest
of
mankind
a
terror
of
ever
marching
against
him
any
more
there
is
no
question
but
that
our
business
is
to
avoid
by
all
means
getting
into
his
clutches
for
my
part
all
the
while
the
truce
lasted
i
never
ceased
pitying
ourselves
and
congratulating
the
king
and
those
with
him
as
like
a
helpless
spectator
i
surveyed
the
extent
and
quality
of
their
territory
the
plenteousness
of
their
provisions
the
multitude
of
their
dependants
their
cattle
their
gold
and
their
apparel
and
then
to
turn
and
ponder
the
condition
of
our
soldiers
without
part
or
lot
in
these
good
things
except
we
bought
it
few
i
knew
had
any
longer
the
wherewithal
to
buy
and
yet
our
oath
held
us
down
so
that
we
could
not
provide
ourselves
otherwise
than
by
purchase
i
say
as
i
reasoned
thus
there
were
times
when
i
dreaded
the
truce
more
than
i
now
dread
war
now
however
that
they
have
abruptly
ended
the
truce
there
is
an
end
also
to
their
own
insolence
and
to
our
suspicion
all
these
good
things
of
theirs
are
now
set
as
prizes
for
the
combatants
to
whichsoever
of
us
shall
prove
the
better
men
will
they
fall
as
guerdons
and
the
gods
themselves
are
the
judges
of
the
strife
the
gods
who
full
surely
will
be
on
our
side
seeing
it
is
our
enemies
who
have
taken
their
names
falsely
whilst
we
with
much
to
lure
us
yet
for
our
oath
sake
and
the
gods
who
were
our
witnesses
sternly
held
aloof
so
that
it
seems
to
me
we
have
a
right
to
enter
upon
this
contest
with
much
more
heart
than
our
foes
and
further
we
are
possessed
of
bodies
more
capable
than
theirs
of
bearing
cold
and
heat
and
labour
souls
too
we
have
by
the
help
of
heaven
better
and
braver
nay
the
men
themselves
are
more
vulnerable
more
mortal
than
ourselves
if
so
be
the
gods
vouchsafe
to
give
us
victory
once
again
howbeit
for
i
doubt
not
elsewhere
similar
reflections
are
being
made
whatsoever
betide
let
us
not
in
heaven
name
wait
for
others
to
come
and
challenge
us
to
noble
deeds
let
us
rather
take
the
lead
in
stimulating
the
rest
to
valour
show
yourselves
to
be
the
bravest
of
officers
and
among
generals
the
worthiest
to
command
for
myself
if
you
choose
to
start
forwards
on
this
quest
i
will
follow
or
if
you
bid
me
lead
you
my
age
shall
be
no
excuse
to
stand
between
me
and
your
orders
at
least
i
am
of
full
age
i
take
it
to
avert
misfortune
from
my
own
head
such
were
the
speaker
words
and
the
officers
when
they
heard
all
with
one
exception
called
upon
him
to
put
himself
at
their
head
this
was
a
certain
apollonides
there
present
who
spoke
in
the
boeotian
dialect
this
man
opinion
was
that
it
was
mere
nonsense
for
any
one
to
pretend
they
could
obtain
safety
otherwise
than
by
an
appeal
to
the
king
if
he
had
skill
to
enforce
it
and
at
the
same
time
he
began
to
dilate
on
the
difficulties
but
xenophon
cut
him
short
o
most
marvellous
of
men
though
you
have
eyes
to
see
you
do
not
perceive
though
you
have
ears
to
hear
you
do
not
recollect
you
were
present
with
the
rest
of
us
now
here
when
after
the
death
of
cyrus
the
king
vaunting
himself
on
that
occurrence
sent
dictatorially
to
bid
us
lay
down
our
arms
but
when
we
instead
of
giving
up
our
arms
put
them
on
and
went
and
pitched
our
camp
near
him
his
manner
changed
it
is
hard
to
say
what
he
did
not
do
he
was
so
at
his
wit
end
sending
us
embassies
and
begging
for
a
truce
and
furnishing
provisions
the
while
until
he
had
got
it
or
to
take
the
contrary
instance
when
just
now
acting
precisely
on
your
principles
our
generals
and
captains
went
trusting
to
the
truce
unarmed
to
a
conference
with
them
what
came
of
it
what
is
happening
at
this
instant
beaten
goaded
with
pricks
insulted
poor
souls
they
can
not
even
die
though
death
i
ween
would
be
very
sweet
and
you
who
know
all
this
how
can
you
say
that
it
is
mere
nonsense
to
talk
of
how
can
you
bid
us
go
again
and
try
the
arts
of
persuasion
in
my
opinion
sirs
we
ought
not
to
admit
this
fellow
to
the
same
rank
with
ourselves
rather
ought
we
to
deprive
him
of
his
captaincy
and
load
him
with
packs
and
treat
him
as
such
the
man
is
a
disgrace
to
his
own
fatherland
and
the
whole
of
hellas
that
being
a
hellene
he
is
what
he
is
here
agasias
the
stymphalian
broke
in
exclaiming
nay
this
fellow
has
no
connection
either
with
boeotia
or
with
hellas
none
whatever
i
have
noted
both
his
ears
bored
like
a
lydian
and
so
it
was
him
then
they
banished
but
the
rest
visited
the
ranks
and
wherever
a
general
was
left
they
summoned
the
general
where
he
was
gone
the
and
where
again
the
captain
alone
was
left
the
captain
as
soon
as
they
were
all
met
they
seated
themselves
in
front
of
the
place
the
assembled
generals
and
officers
numbering
about
a
hundred
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
this
took
place
thereupon
hieronymous
the
eleian
the
eldest
of
proxenus
captains
commenced
speaking
as
follows
generals
and
captains
it
seemed
right
to
us
in
view
of
the
present
crisis
ourselves
to
assemble
and
to
summon
you
that
we
might
advise
upon
some
practicable
course
would
you
xenophon
repeat
what
you
said
to
us
thereupon
xenophon
spoke
as
follows
we
all
know
only
too
well
that
the
king
and
tissaphernes
have
seized
as
many
of
us
as
they
could
and
it
is
clear
they
are
plotting
to
destroy
the
rest
of
us
if
they
can
our
business
is
plain
it
is
to
do
all
we
can
to
avoid
getting
into
the
power
of
the
barbarians
rather
if
we
can
we
will
get
them
into
our
power
rely
upon
this
then
all
you
who
are
here
assembled
now
is
your
great
opportunity
the
soldiers
outside
have
their
eyes
fixed
upon
you
if
they
think
that
you
are
they
will
turn
cowards
but
if
you
show
them
that
you
are
making
your
own
preparations
to
attack
the
enemy
and
setting
an
example
to
the
rest
follow
you
be
assured
they
will
imitate
you
they
will
may
be
it
is
but
right
and
fair
that
you
should
somewhat
excel
them
for
you
are
generals
you
are
commanders
of
brigades
or
regiments
and
if
while
it
was
peace
you
had
the
advantage
in
wealth
and
position
so
now
when
it
is
war
you
are
expected
to
rise
superior
to
the
common
herd
to
think
for
them
to
toil
for
them
whenever
there
be
need
at
this
very
moment
you
would
confer
a
great
boon
on
the
army
if
you
made
it
your
business
to
appoint
generals
and
officers
to
fill
the
places
of
those
that
are
lost
for
without
leaders
nothing
good
or
noble
to
put
it
concisely
was
ever
wrought
anywhere
and
in
military
matters
this
is
absolutely
true
for
if
discipline
is
held
to
be
of
saving
virtue
the
want
of
it
has
been
the
ruin
of
many
ere
now
well
then
when
you
have
appointed
all
the
commanders
necessary
it
would
only
be
opportune
i
take
it
if
you
were
to
summon
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
and
speak
some
words
of
encouragement
even
now
i
daresay
you
noticed
yourselves
the
crestfallen
air
with
which
they
came
into
camp
the
despondency
with
which
they
fell
to
picket
duty
so
that
unless
there
is
a
change
for
the
better
i
do
not
know
for
what
service
they
will
be
fit
whether
by
night
if
need
were
or
even
by
day
the
thing
is
to
get
them
to
turn
their
thoughts
to
what
they
mean
to
do
instead
of
to
what
they
are
likely
to
suffer
do
that
and
their
spirits
will
soon
revive
wonderfully
you
know
i
need
hardly
remind
you
it
is
not
numbers
or
strength
that
gives
victory
in
war
but
heaven
helping
them
to
one
or
other
of
two
combatants
it
is
given
to
dash
with
stouter
hearts
to
meet
the
foe
and
such
onset
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
those
others
refuse
to
meet
this
observation
also
i
have
laid
to
heart
that
they
who
in
matters
of
war
seek
in
all
ways
to
save
their
lives
are
just
they
who
as
a
rule
die
dishonourably
whereas
they
who
recognising
that
death
is
the
common
lot
and
destiny
of
all
men
strive
hard
to
die
nobly
these
more
frequently
as
i
observe
do
after
all
attain
to
old
age
or
at
any
rate
while
life
lasts
they
spend
their
days
more
happily
this
lesson
let
all
lay
to
heart
this
day
for
we
are
just
at
such
a
crisis
of
our
fate
now
is
the
season
to
be
brave
ourselves
and
to
stimulate
the
rest
by
our
example
with
these
words
he
ceased
and
after
him
cheirisophus
said
xenophon
hitherto
i
knew
only
so
much
of
you
as
that
you
were
i
heard
an
athenian
but
now
i
must
commend
you
for
your
words
and
for
your
conduct
i
hope
that
there
may
be
many
more
like
you
for
it
would
prove
a
public
blessing
then
turning
to
the
officers
and
now
said
he
let
us
waste
no
time
retire
at
once
i
beg
you
and
choose
leaders
where
you
need
them
after
you
have
made
your
elections
come
back
to
the
middle
of
the
camp
and
bring
the
newly
appointed
officers
after
that
we
will
there
summon
a
general
meeting
of
the
soldiers
let
tolmides
the
herald
he
added
be
in
attendance
with
these
words
on
his
lips
he
got
up
in
order
that
what
was
needful
might
be
done
at
once
without
delay
after
this
the
generals
were
chosen
these
were
timasion
the
dardanian
in
place
of
clearchus
xanthicles
an
achaean
in
place
of
socrates
cleanor
an
arcadian
in
place
of
agias
philesius
an
achaean
in
place
of
menon
and
in
place
of
proxenus
xenophon
the
athenian
ii
by
the
time
the
new
generals
had
been
chosen
the
first
faint
glimmer
of
dawn
had
hardly
commenced
as
they
met
in
the
centre
of
the
camp
and
resolved
to
post
an
advance
guard
and
to
call
a
general
meeting
of
the
soldiers
now
when
these
had
come
together
cheirisophus
the
lacedaemonian
first
rose
and
spoke
as
follows
the
present
posture
of
affairs
is
not
pleasant
seeing
that
we
are
robbed
of
so
many
generals
and
captains
and
soldiers
and
more
than
that
our
former
allies
ariaeus
and
his
men
have
betrayed
us
still
we
must
rise
above
our
circumstances
to
prove
ourselves
brave
men
and
not
give
in
but
try
to
save
ourselves
by
glorious
victory
if
we
can
or
if
not
at
least
to
die
gloriously
and
never
while
we
have
breath
in
our
bodies
fall
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies
in
which
latter
case
i
fear
we
shall
suffer
things
which
i
pray
the
gods
may
visit
rather
upon
those
we
hate
at
this
point
cleanor
the
ochomenian
stood
up
and
spoke
as
follows
you
see
men
the
perjury
and
the
impiety
of
the
king
you
see
the
faithlessness
of
tissaphernes
professing
that
he
was
neighbour
to
hellas
and
would
give
a
good
deal
to
save
us
in
confirmation
of
which
he
took
an
oath
to
us
himself
he
gave
us
the
pledge
of
his
right
hand
and
then
with
a
lie
upon
his
lips
this
same
man
turned
round
and
arrested
our
generals
he
had
no
reverence
even
for
zeus
the
god
of
strangers
but
after
entertaining
clearchus
at
his
own
board
as
a
friend
he
used
his
hospitality
to
delude
and
decoy
his
victims
and
ariaeus
whom
we
offered
to
make
king
with
whom
we
exchanged
pledges
not
to
betray
each
other
even
this
man
without
a
particle
of
fear
of
the
gods
or
respect
for
cyrus
in
his
grave
though
he
was
most
honoured
by
cyrus
in
lifetime
even
he
has
turned
aside
to
the
worst
foes
of
cyrus
and
is
doing
his
best
to
injure
the
dead
man
friends
them
may
the
gods
requite
as
they
deserve
but
we
with
these
things
before
our
eyes
will
not
any
more
be
cheated
and
cajoled
by
them
we
will
make
the
best
fight
we
can
and
having
made
it
whatever
the
gods
think
fit
to
send
we
will
accept
after
him
xenophon
arose
he
was
arrayed
for
war
in
his
bravest
apparel
for
said
he
to
himself
if
the
gods
grant
victory
the
finest
attire
will
match
with
victory
best
or
if
i
must
needs
die
then
for
one
who
has
aspired
to
the
noblest
it
is
well
there
should
be
some
outward
correspondence
between
his
expectation
and
his
end
he
began
his
speech
as
follows
cleanor
has
spoken
of
the
perjury
and
faithlessness
of
the
barbarians
and
you
yourselves
know
them
only
too
well
i
fancy
if
then
we
are
minded
to
enter
a
second
time
into
terms
of
friendship
with
them
with
the
experience
of
what
our
generals
who
in
all
confidence
entrusted
themselves
to
their
power
have
suffered
reason
would
we
should
feel
deep
despondency
if
on
the
other
hand
we
purpose
to
take
our
good
swords
in
our
hands
and
to
inflict
punishment
on
them
for
what
they
have
done
and
from
this
time
forward
will
be
on
terms
of
downright
war
with
them
then
god
helping
we
have
many
a
bright
hope
of
safety
the
words
were
scarcely
spoken
when
someone
sneezed
and
with
one
impulse
the
soldiers
bowed
in
worship
and
xenophon
proceeded
i
propose
sirs
since
even
as
we
spoke
of
safety
an
omen
from
zeus
the
saviour
has
appeared
we
vow
a
vow
to
sacrifice
to
the
saviour
for
safe
deliverance
wheresoever
first
we
reach
a
friendly
country
and
let
us
couple
with
that
vow
another
of
individual
assent
that
we
will
offer
to
the
rest
of
the
gods
to
our
ability
let
all
those
who
are
in
favour
of
this
proposal
hold
up
their
hands
they
all
held
up
their
hands
and
there
and
then
they
vowed
a
vow
and
chanted
the
battle
hymn
but
as
soon
as
these
sacred
matters
were
duly
ended
he
began
once
more
thus
i
was
saying
that
many
and
bright
are
the
hopes
we
have
of
safety
first
of
all
we
it
is
who
confirm
and
ratify
the
oaths
we
take
by
heaven
but
our
enemies
have
taken
false
oaths
and
broken
the
truce
contrary
to
their
solemn
word
this
being
so
it
is
but
natural
that
the
gods
should
be
opposed
to
our
enemies
but
with
ourselves
allied
the
gods
who
are
able
to
make
the
great
ones
quickly
small
and
out
of
sore
perplexity
can
save
the
little
ones
with
ease
what
time
it
pleases
them
in
the
next
place
let
me
recall
to
your
minds
the
dangers
of
our
own
forefathers
that
you
may
see
and
know
that
bravery
is
your
heirloom
and
that
by
the
aid
of
the
gods
brave
men
are
rescued
even
out
of
the
midst
of
sorest
straits
so
was
it
when
the
persians
came
and
their
attendant
hosts
with
a
very
great
armament
to
wipe
out
athens
from
the
face
of
the
earth
the
men
of
athens
had
the
heart
to
withstand
them
and
conquered
them
then
they
vowed
to
artemis
that
for
every
man
they
slew
of
the
enemy
they
would
sacrifice
to
the
goddess
goats
so
many
and
when
they
could
not
find
sufficient
for
the
slain
they
resolved
to
offer
yearly
five
hundred
and
to
this
day
they
perform
that
sacrifice
and
at
a
somewhat
later
date
when
xerxes
assembled
his
countless
hosts
and
marched
upon
hellas
then
too
our
fathers
conquered
the
forefathers
of
our
foes
by
land
and
by
sea
so
it
is
said
of
the
russian
general
skobelef
that
he
had
a
strange
custom
of
going
into
battle
in
his
cleanest
uniform
perfumed
and
wearing
a
sword
in
order
that
as
he
said
he
might
die
in
his
best
attire
for
this
ancient
omen
see
odyssey
xvii
even
as
she
spake
and
telemachus
sneezed
loudly
and
around
the
roof
rung
wondrously
and
penelope
dost
thou
not
mark
how
my
son
has
sneezed
a
blessing
on
all
my
words
see
herod
vi
the
allusion
is
to
the
invasion
of
greeze
by
datis
and
artaphernes
and
to
their
defeat
at
marathon
heredotus
estimates
the
number
of
those
who
fell
on
the
persian
side
at
men
the
number
of
athenian
dead
is
accurately
known
since
all
were
collected
for
the
last
solemn
obsequies
they
were
grote
hist
of
greece
vol
then
at
salamis
and
at
plataea
and
mycale
on
the
same
day
and
proofs
of
these
things
are
yet
to
be
seen
in
trophies
but
the
greatest
witness
of
all
is
the
freedom
of
our
cities
the
liberty
of
that
land
in
which
you
were
born
and
bred
for
you
call
no
man
master
or
lord
you
bow
your
heads
to
none
save
to
the
gods
alone
such
were
your
forefathers
and
their
sons
are
ye
think
not
i
am
going
to
say
that
you
put
to
shame
in
any
way
your
ancestry
far
from
it
not
many
days
since
you
too
were
drawn
up
in
battle
face
to
face
with
these
true
descendants
of
their
ancestors
and
by
the
help
of
heaven
you
conquered
them
though
they
many
times
outnumbered
you
at
that
time
it
was
to
win
a
throne
for
cyrus
that
you
showed
your
bravery
when
the
struggle
is
for
your
own
salvation
what
is
more
natural
than
that
you
should
show
yourselves
braver
and
more
zealous
still
nay
it
is
very
meet
and
right
that
you
should
be
more
undaunted
still
to
face
the
foe
the
other
day
though
you
had
not
tested
them
and
before
your
eyes
lay
their
immeasurable
host
you
had
the
heart
to
go
against
them
with
the
spirit
of
your
fathers
you
have
made
trial
of
them
and
knowing
that
however
many
times
your
number
they
do
not
care
to
await
your
onset
what
concern
have
you
now
to
be
afraid
of
them
nor
let
any
one
suppose
that
herein
is
a
point
of
weakness
in
that
cyrus
troops
who
before
were
drawn
up
by
your
side
have
now
deserted
us
for
they
are
even
worse
cowards
still
than
those
we
worsted
at
any
rate
they
have
deserted
us
and
sought
refuge
with
them
leaders
of
the
forlorn
hope
of
flight
far
better
is
it
to
have
them
brigaded
with
the
enemy
than
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
our
ranks
but
if
any
of
you
is
out
of
heart
to
think
that
we
have
no
cavalry
while
the
enemy
have
many
squadrons
to
command
lay
to
heart
this
doctrine
that
ten
thousand
horse
only
equal
ten
thousand
men
upon
their
backs
neither
less
nor
more
did
any
one
ever
die
in
battle
from
the
bite
or
kick
of
a
horse
it
is
the
men
the
real
swordsmen
who
do
whatever
is
done
in
battles
in
fact
we
on
our
stout
shanks
are
better
mounted
than
those
cavalry
fellows
there
they
hang
on
to
their
horses
necks
in
mortal
dread
not
only
of
us
but
of
falling
off
while
we
well
planted
upon
earth
can
deal
far
heavier
blows
to
our
assailants
and
aim
more
steadily
at
who
we
will
there
is
one
point
i
admit
in
which
their
cavalry
have
the
of
us
it
is
safer
for
them
than
it
is
for
us
to
run
away
may
be
however
you
are
in
good
heart
about
the
fighting
but
annoyed
to
think
that
tissaphernes
will
not
guide
us
any
more
and
that
the
king
will
not
furnish
us
with
a
market
any
longer
now
consider
is
it
better
for
us
to
have
a
guide
like
tissaphernes
whom
we
know
to
be
plotting
against
us
or
to
take
our
chance
of
the
stray
people
whom
we
catch
and
compel
to
guide
us
who
will
know
that
any
mistake
made
in
leading
us
will
be
a
sad
mistake
for
their
own
lives
again
is
it
better
to
be
buying
provisions
in
a
market
of
their
providing
in
scant
measure
and
at
high
prices
without
even
the
money
to
pay
for
them
any
longer
or
by
right
of
conquest
to
help
ourselves
applying
such
measure
as
suits
our
fancy
best
or
again
perhaps
you
admit
that
our
present
position
is
not
without
its
advantages
but
you
feel
sure
that
the
rivers
are
a
difficulty
and
think
that
you
were
never
more
taken
in
than
when
you
crossed
them
if
so
consider
whether
after
all
this
is
not
perhaps
the
most
foolish
thing
which
the
barbarians
have
done
no
river
is
impassable
throughout
whatever
difficulties
it
may
present
at
some
distance
from
its
source
you
need
only
make
your
way
up
to
the
springhead
and
there
you
may
cross
it
without
wetting
more
than
your
ankles
but
granted
that
the
rivers
do
bar
our
passage
and
that
guides
are
not
forthcoming
what
care
we
we
need
feel
no
alarm
for
all
that
we
have
heard
of
the
mysians
a
people
whom
we
certainly
can
not
admit
to
be
better
than
ourselves
and
yet
they
inhabit
numbers
of
large
and
prosperous
cities
in
the
king
own
country
without
asking
leave
the
pisidians
are
an
equally
good
instance
or
the
lycaonians
we
have
seen
with
our
own
eyes
how
they
fare
seizing
fortresses
down
in
the
plains
and
reaping
the
fruits
of
these
men
territory
as
to
us
i
go
so
far
as
to
assert
we
ought
never
to
have
let
it
be
seen
that
we
were
bent
on
getting
home
at
any
rate
not
so
soon
we
should
have
begun
stocking
and
furnishing
ourselves
as
if
we
fully
meant
to
settle
down
for
life
somewhere
or
other
hereabouts
i
am
sure
that
the
king
would
be
thrice
glad
to
give
the
mysians
as
many
guides
as
they
like
or
as
many
hostages
as
they
care
to
demand
in
return
for
a
safe
conduct
out
of
his
country
he
would
make
carriage
roads
for
them
and
if
they
preferred
to
take
their
departure
in
coaches
and
four
he
would
not
say
them
nay
so
too
i
am
sure
he
would
be
only
too
glad
to
accommodate
us
in
the
same
way
if
he
saw
us
preparing
to
settle
down
here
but
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
that
we
did
not
stop
for
i
fear
if
once
we
learn
to
live
in
idleness
and
to
batten
in
luxury
and
dalliance
with
these
tall
and
handsome
median
and
persian
women
and
maidens
we
shall
be
like
the
and
forget
the
road
home
altogether
see
odyssey
ix
ever
feeding
on
the
lotus
and
forgetful
of
returning
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
only
right
in
the
first
instance
to
make
an
effort
to
return
to
hellas
and
to
revisit
our
hearths
and
homes
if
only
to
prove
to
other
hellenes
that
it
is
their
own
faults
if
they
are
poor
and
needy
seeing
it
is
in
their
power
to
give
to
those
now
living
a
pauper
life
at
home
a
free
passage
hither
and
convert
them
into
burghers
at
once
now
sirs
is
it
not
clear
that
all
these
good
things
belong
to
whoever
has
strength
to
hold
them
here
seems
to
be
the
germ
unless
indeed
the
thought
had
been
conceived
above
here
at
any
rate
the
first
conscious
expression
of
the
colonisation
scheme
of
which
we
shall
hear
more
below
in
reference
to
cotyora
the
phasis
calpe
it
appears
again
fifty
years
later
in
the
author
pamphlet
on
revenues
chapters
and
vi
for
the
special
evils
of
the
fourth
century
and
the
growth
of
pauperism
between
and
see
jebb
attic
orators
vol
let
us
look
another
matter
in
the
face
how
are
we
to
march
most
safely
or
where
blows
are
needed
how
are
we
to
fight
to
the
best
advantage
that
is
the
question
the
first
thing
which
i
recommend
is
to
burn
the
wagons
we
have
got
so
that
we
may
be
free
to
march
wherever
the
army
needs
and
not
practically
make
our
baggage
train
our
general
and
next
we
should
throw
our
tents
into
the
bonfire
also
for
these
again
are
only
a
trouble
to
carry
and
do
not
contribute
one
grain
of
good
either
for
fighting
or
getting
provisions
further
let
us
get
rid
of
all
superfluous
baggage
save
only
what
we
require
for
the
sake
of
war
or
meat
and
drink
so
that
as
many
of
us
as
possible
may
be
under
arms
and
as
few
as
possible
doing
porterage
i
need
not
remind
you
that
in
case
of
defeat
the
owners
goods
are
not
their
own
but
if
we
master
our
foes
we
will
make
them
our
baggage
bearers
it
only
rests
for
me
to
name
the
one
thing
which
i
look
upon
as
the
greatest
of
all
you
see
the
enemy
did
not
dare
to
bring
war
to
bear
upon
us
until
they
had
first
seized
our
generals
they
felt
that
whilst
our
rulers
were
there
and
we
obeyed
them
they
were
no
match
for
us
in
war
but
having
got
hold
of
them
they
fully
expected
that
the
consequent
confusion
and
anarchy
would
prove
fatal
to
us
what
follows
this
officers
and
leaders
ought
to
be
more
vigilant
ever
than
their
predecessors
subordinates
still
more
orderly
and
obedient
to
those
in
command
now
than
even
they
were
to
those
who
are
gone
and
you
should
pass
a
resolution
that
in
case
of
insubordination
any
one
who
stands
by
is
to
aid
the
officer
in
chastising
the
offender
so
the
enemy
will
be
mightily
deceived
for
on
this
day
they
will
behold
ten
thousand
clearchuses
instead
of
one
who
will
not
suffer
one
man
to
play
the
coward
and
now
it
is
high
time
i
brought
my
remarks
to
an
end
for
may
be
the
enemy
will
be
here
anon
let
those
who
are
in
favour
of
these
proposals
confirm
them
with
all
speed
that
they
may
be
realised
in
fact
or
if
any
other
course
seem
better
let
not
any
one
even
though
he
be
a
private
soldier
shrink
from
proposing
it
our
common
safety
is
our
common
need
after
this
cheirisophus
spoke
he
said
if
there
is
anything
else
to
be
done
beyond
what
xenophon
has
mentioned
we
shall
be
able
to
carry
it
out
presently
but
with
regard
to
what
he
has
already
proposed
it
seems
to
me
the
best
course
to
vote
upon
the
matters
at
once
those
who
are
in
favour
of
xenophon
proposals
hold
up
their
hands
they
all
held
them
up
xenophon
rose
again
and
said
listen
sirs
while
i
tell
you
what
i
think
we
have
need
of
besides
it
is
clear
that
we
must
march
where
we
can
get
provisions
now
i
am
told
there
are
some
splendid
villages
not
more
than
two
miles
and
a
half
distant
i
should
not
be
surprised
then
if
the
enemy
were
to
hang
on
our
heels
and
dog
us
as
we
retire
like
cowardly
curs
which
rush
out
at
the
and
bite
him
if
they
can
but
when
you
turn
upon
them
they
run
away
such
will
be
their
tactics
i
take
it
it
may
be
safer
then
to
march
in
a
hollow
square
so
as
to
place
the
baggage
animals
and
our
mob
of
sutlers
in
greater
security
it
will
save
time
to
make
the
appointments
at
once
and
to
settle
who
leads
the
square
and
directs
the
vanguard
who
will
take
command
of
the
two
flanks
and
who
of
the
rearguard
so
that
when
the
enemy
appears
we
shall
not
need
to
deliberate
but
can
at
once
set
in
motion
the
machinery
in
existence
if
any
one
has
any
better
plan
we
need
not
adopt
mine
but
if
not
suppose
cheirisophus
takes
the
lead
as
he
is
a
lacedaemonian
and
the
two
eldest
generals
take
in
charge
the
two
wings
respectively
whilst
timasion
and
i
the
two
youngest
will
for
the
present
guard
the
rear
for
the
rest
we
can
but
make
experiment
of
this
arrangement
and
alter
it
with
deliberation
as
from
time
to
time
any
improvement
suggests
itself
if
any
one
has
a
better
plan
to
propose
let
him
do
no
dissentient
voice
was
heard
accordingly
he
said
those
in
favour
of
this
resolution
hold
up
their
hands
the
resolution
was
carried
and
now
said
he
it
would
be
well
to
separate
and
carry
out
what
we
have
decreed
if
any
of
you
has
set
his
heart
on
seeing
his
friends
again
let
him
remember
to
prove
himself
a
man
there
is
no
other
way
to
achieve
his
heart
wish
or
is
mere
living
an
object
with
any
of
you
strive
to
conquer
if
to
slay
is
the
privilege
of
victory
to
die
is
the
doom
of
the
defeated
or
perhaps
to
gain
money
and
wealth
is
your
ambition
strive
again
for
mastery
have
not
conquerors
the
double
gain
of
keeping
what
is
their
own
whilst
they
seize
the
possessions
of
the
vanquished
iii
the
speaking
was
ended
they
got
up
and
retired
then
they
burnt
the
wagons
and
the
tents
and
after
sharing
with
one
another
what
each
needed
out
of
their
various
superfluities
they
threw
the
remnant
into
the
fire
having
done
that
they
proceeded
to
make
their
breakfasts
while
they
were
breakfasting
mithridates
came
with
about
thirty
horsemen
and
summoning
the
generals
within
earshot
he
thus
addressed
them
men
of
hellas
i
have
been
faithful
to
cyrus
as
you
know
well
and
i
am
your
indeed
i
am
here
spending
my
days
in
great
fear
if
then
i
could
see
any
salutory
course
in
prospect
i
should
be
disposed
to
join
you
with
all
my
retainers
please
inform
me
then
as
to
what
you
propose
regarding
me
as
your
friend
and
anxious
only
to
pursue
his
march
in
your
company
the
generals
held
council
and
resolved
to
give
the
following
answer
cheirisophus
acting
as
spokesman
we
have
resolved
to
make
our
way
through
the
country
inflicting
the
least
possible
damage
provided
we
are
allowed
a
free
passage
homewards
but
if
any
one
tries
to
hinder
us
he
will
have
to
fight
it
out
with
us
and
we
shall
bring
all
the
force
in
our
power
to
bear
thereat
mithridates
set
himself
to
prove
to
them
that
their
deliverance
except
with
the
king
good
pleasure
was
hopeless
then
the
meaning
of
his
mission
was
plain
he
was
an
agent
in
disguise
in
fact
a
relation
of
tissaphernes
was
in
attendance
to
keep
a
check
on
his
loyalty
after
that
the
generals
resolved
that
it
would
be
better
to
proclaim
open
war
without
truce
or
herald
as
long
as
they
were
in
the
enemy
country
for
they
used
to
come
and
corrupt
the
soldiers
and
they
were
even
successful
with
one
officer
nicarchus
an
arcadian
who
went
off
in
the
night
with
about
twenty
men
can
this
be
the
same
man
whose
escape
is
so
graphically
described
above
after
this
they
breakfasted
and
crossed
the
river
zapatas
marching
in
regular
order
with
the
beasts
and
mob
of
the
army
in
the
middle
they
had
not
advanced
far
on
their
route
when
mithridates
made
his
appearance
again
with
about
a
couple
of
hundred
horsemen
at
his
back
and
bowmen
and
slingers
twice
as
many
as
nimble
fellows
as
a
man
might
hope
to
see
he
approached
the
hellenes
as
if
he
were
friendly
but
when
they
had
got
fairly
to
close
quarters
all
of
a
sudden
some
of
them
whether
mounted
or
on
foot
began
shooting
with
their
bows
and
arrows
and
another
set
with
slings
wounding
the
men
the
rearguard
of
the
hellenes
suffered
for
a
while
severely
without
being
able
to
retaliate
for
the
cretans
had
a
shorter
range
than
the
persians
and
at
the
same
time
being
troops
they
lay
cooped
up
within
the
ranks
of
the
heavy
infantry
while
the
javelin
men
again
did
not
shoot
far
enough
to
reach
the
enemy
slingers
this
being
so
xenophon
thought
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
charge
and
charge
they
did
some
of
the
heavy
and
light
infantry
who
were
guarding
the
rear
with
him
but
for
all
their
charging
they
did
not
catch
a
single
man
the
dearth
of
cavalry
told
against
the
hellenes
nor
were
their
infantry
able
to
overhaul
the
enemy
infantry
with
the
long
start
they
had
and
considering
the
shortness
of
the
race
for
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
pursue
them
far
from
the
main
body
of
the
army
on
the
other
hand
the
asiatic
cavalry
even
while
fleeing
poured
volleys
of
arrows
behind
their
backs
and
wounded
the
pursuers
while
the
hellenes
must
fall
back
fighting
every
step
of
the
way
they
had
measured
in
the
pursuit
so
that
by
the
end
of
that
day
they
had
not
gone
much
more
than
three
miles
but
in
the
late
afternoon
they
reached
the
villages
here
there
was
a
return
of
the
old
despondency
cheirisophus
and
the
eldest
of
the
generals
blamed
xenophon
for
leaving
the
main
body
to
give
chase
and
endangering
himself
thereby
while
he
could
not
damage
the
enemy
one
whit
the
more
xenophon
admitted
that
they
were
right
in
blaming
him
no
better
proof
of
that
was
wanted
than
the
result
the
fact
is
he
added
i
was
driven
to
pursue
it
was
too
trying
to
look
on
and
see
our
men
suffer
so
badly
and
be
unable
to
retaliate
however
when
we
did
charge
there
is
no
denying
the
truth
of
what
you
say
we
were
not
a
whit
more
able
to
injure
the
enemy
while
we
had
considerable
difficulty
in
beating
a
retreat
ourselves
thank
heaven
they
did
not
come
upon
us
in
any
great
force
but
were
only
a
handful
of
men
so
that
the
injury
they
did
us
was
not
large
as
it
might
have
been
and
at
least
it
has
served
to
show
us
what
we
need
at
present
the
enemy
shoot
and
sling
beyond
our
range
so
that
our
cretan
archers
are
no
match
for
them
our
can
not
reach
as
far
and
when
we
pursue
it
is
not
possible
to
push
the
pursuit
to
any
great
distance
from
the
main
body
and
within
the
short
distance
no
however
fleet
of
foot
could
overtake
another
who
has
a
the
start
of
him
if
then
we
are
to
exclude
them
from
all
possibility
of
injuring
us
as
we
march
we
must
get
slingers
as
soon
as
possible
and
cavalry
i
am
told
there
are
in
the
army
some
rhodians
most
of
whom
they
say
know
how
to
sling
and
their
missile
will
reach
even
twice
as
far
as
the
persian
slings
which
on
account
of
their
being
loaded
with
stones
as
big
as
fist
have
a
comparatively
short
range
but
the
rhodians
are
skilled
in
the
use
of
leaden
bullets
suppose
then
we
investigate
and
find
out
first
of
all
who
among
them
possess
slings
and
for
these
slings
offer
the
owner
the
money
value
and
to
another
who
will
plait
some
more
hand
over
the
money
price
and
for
a
third
who
will
volunteer
to
be
enrolled
as
a
slinger
invent
some
other
sort
of
privilege
i
think
we
shall
soon
find
people
to
come
forward
capable
of
helping
us
there
are
horses
in
the
army
i
know
some
few
with
myself
others
belonging
to
clearchus
stud
and
a
good
many
others
captured
from
the
enemy
used
for
carrying
baggage
let
us
take
the
pick
of
these
supplying
their
places
by
ordinary
baggage
animals
and
equipping
the
horses
for
cavalry
i
should
not
wonder
if
our
troopers
gave
some
annoyance
to
these
fugitives
these
words
sound
to
me
like
an
author
note
parenthetically
and
perhaps
inadvertently
inserted
into
the
text
it
is
an
aside
to
the
reader
which
in
a
modern
book
would
appear
as
a
footnote
these
proposals
were
carried
and
that
night
two
hundred
slingers
were
enrolled
and
next
day
as
many
as
fifty
horse
and
horsemen
passed
muster
as
duly
qualified
buff
jackets
and
cuirasses
were
provided
for
them
and
a
commandant
of
cavalry
appointed
to
command
lycius
the
son
of
polystratus
by
name
an
athenian
iv
that
day
they
remained
inactive
but
the
next
they
rose
earlier
than
usual
and
set
out
betimes
for
they
had
a
ravine
to
cross
where
they
feared
the
enemy
might
attack
them
in
the
act
of
crossing
when
they
were
across
mithridates
appeared
again
with
one
thousand
horse
and
archers
and
slingers
to
the
number
of
four
thousand
this
whole
body
he
had
got
by
request
from
tissaphernes
and
in
return
he
undertook
to
deliver
up
the
hellenes
to
tissaphernes
he
had
grown
contemptuous
since
his
late
attack
when
with
so
small
a
detachment
he
had
done
as
he
thought
a
good
deal
of
mischief
without
the
slightest
loss
to
himself
when
the
hellenes
were
not
only
right
across
but
had
got
about
a
mile
from
the
ravine
mithridates
also
crossed
with
his
forces
an
order
had
been
passed
down
the
lines
what
light
infantry
and
what
heavy
infantry
were
to
take
part
in
the
pursuit
and
the
cavalry
were
instructed
to
follow
up
the
pursuit
with
confidence
as
a
considerable
support
was
in
their
rear
so
when
mithridates
had
come
up
with
them
and
they
were
well
within
arrow
and
sling
shot
the
bugle
sounded
the
signal
to
the
hellenes
and
immediately
the
detachment
under
orders
rushed
to
close
quarters
and
the
cavalry
charged
there
the
enemy
preferred
not
to
wait
but
fled
towards
the
ravine
in
this
pursuit
the
asiatics
lost
several
of
their
infantry
killed
and
of
their
cavalry
as
many
as
eighteen
were
taken
prisoners
in
the
ravine
as
to
those
who
were
slain
the
hellenes
acting
upon
impulse
mutilated
their
bodies
by
way
of
impressing
their
enemy
with
as
frightful
an
image
as
possible
so
fared
the
foe
and
so
fell
back
but
the
hellenes
continuing
their
march
in
safety
for
the
rest
of
that
day
reached
the
river
tigris
here
they
came
upon
a
large
deserted
city
the
name
of
which
was
larissa
a
place
inhabited
by
the
medes
in
days
of
old
the
breadth
of
its
walls
was
feet
and
the
height
of
them
a
hundred
and
the
circuit
of
the
whole
two
parasangs
it
was
built
of
supported
on
a
stone
basis
twenty
feet
high
this
city
the
king
of
the
persians
besieged
what
time
the
persians
strove
to
snatch
their
empire
from
the
medes
but
he
could
in
no
wise
take
it
then
a
cloud
hid
the
face
of
the
sun
and
blotted
out
the
light
thereof
until
the
inhabitants
were
gone
out
of
the
city
and
so
it
was
taken
by
the
side
of
this
city
there
was
a
stone
pyramid
in
breadth
a
hundred
feet
and
in
height
two
hundred
feet
in
it
were
many
of
the
barbarians
who
had
fled
for
refuge
from
the
neighbouring
villages
larissa
on
the
side
of
the
modern
nimrud
the
corner
as
is
commonly
supposed
of
nineveh
the
name
is
said
to
mean
citadel
and
is
given
to
various
greek
cities
of
which
several
occur
in
xenophon
cyrus
the
great
from
this
place
they
marched
one
stage
of
six
parasangs
to
a
great
deserted
fortress
which
lay
over
against
the
city
and
the
name
of
that
city
was
mespila
the
medes
once
dwelt
in
it
the
basement
was
made
of
polished
stone
full
of
shells
fifty
feet
was
the
breadth
of
it
and
fifty
feet
the
height
and
on
this
basement
was
reared
a
wall
of
brick
the
breadth
whereof
was
fifty
feet
and
the
height
thereof
four
hundred
and
the
circuit
of
the
wall
was
six
parasangs
hither
as
the
story
goes
medea
the
king
wife
betook
herself
in
flight
what
time
the
medes
lost
their
empire
at
the
hands
of
the
persians
to
this
city
also
the
king
of
the
pesians
laid
siege
but
could
not
take
it
either
by
length
of
days
or
strength
of
hand
but
zeus
sent
amazement
on
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
so
it
was
taken
opposite
mosul
the
portion
of
the
ancient
nineveh
about
eighteen
miles
above
larissa
the
circuit
of
nineveh
is
said
to
have
been
about
miles
it
was
overthrown
by
cyrus
in
the
wife
of
astyages
the
last
king
of
media
some
think
the
wall
of
media
should
be
medea
wall
constructed
in
the
period
of
queen
nitocris
from
this
place
they
marched
one
stage
four
parasangs
but
while
still
on
this
stage
tissaphernes
made
his
appearance
he
had
with
him
his
own
cavalry
and
a
force
belonging
to
orontas
who
had
the
daughter
to
wife
and
there
were
moreover
with
them
the
asiatics
whom
cyrus
had
taken
with
him
on
his
march
up
together
with
those
whom
the
king
brother
had
brought
as
a
reinforcement
to
the
king
besides
those
whom
tissaphernes
himself
had
received
as
a
gift
from
the
king
so
that
the
armament
appeared
to
be
very
great
when
they
were
close
he
halted
some
of
his
regiments
at
the
rear
and
wheeled
others
into
position
on
either
flank
but
hesitated
to
attack
having
no
mind
apparently
to
run
any
risks
and
contenting
himself
with
an
order
to
his
slingers
to
sling
and
his
archers
to
shoot
but
when
the
rhodian
slingers
and
the
bowmen
posted
at
intervals
retaliated
and
every
shot
told
for
with
the
utmost
pains
to
miss
it
would
have
been
hard
to
do
so
under
the
circumstanecs
then
tissaphernes
with
all
speed
retired
out
of
range
the
other
regiments
following
suit
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
one
party
advanced
and
the
other
followed
but
now
the
asiatics
had
ceased
to
be
dangerous
with
their
sharpshooting
for
the
rhodians
could
reach
further
than
the
persian
slingers
or
indeed
than
most
of
the
bowmen
the
persian
bows
are
of
great
size
so
that
the
cretans
found
the
arrows
which
were
picked
up
serviceable
and
persevered
in
using
their
enemies
arrows
and
practised
shooting
with
them
letting
them
fly
upwards
to
a
great
height
there
were
also
plenty
of
bowstrings
found
in
the
villages
and
lead
which
they
turned
to
account
for
their
slings
as
a
result
of
this
day
then
the
hellenes
chancing
upon
some
villages
had
no
sooner
encamped
than
the
barbarians
fell
back
having
had
distinctly
the
worst
of
it
in
the
skirmishing
the
best
mss
read
skuthai
scythians
if
this
is
correct
it
is
only
the
technical
name
for
archers
cf
arrian

ii
the
police
at
athens
were
technically
so
called
as
being
composed
of
scythian
slaves
cf
aristoph
thesm
in
practising
in
order
to
get
the
maximum
range
they
let
fly
the
arrows
not
horizontally
but
up
into
the
air
sir
raleigh
hist
of
the
world
iii
x
says
that
xenophon
trained
his
archers
to
short
compass
who
had
been
accustomed
to
the
point
blank
but
this
is
surely
not
xenophon
meaning
the
next
day
was
a
day
of
inaction
they
halted
and
took
in
supplies
as
there
was
much
corn
in
the
villages
but
on
the
day
following
the
march
was
continued
through
the
plain
of
the
tigris
and
tissaphernes
still
hung
on
their
skirts
with
his
skirmishers
and
now
it
was
that
the
hellenes
discovered
the
defect
of
marching
in
a
square
with
an
enemy
following
as
a
matter
of
necessity
whenever
the
wings
of
an
army
so
disposed
draw
together
either
where
a
road
narrows
or
hills
close
in
or
a
bridge
has
to
be
crossed
the
heavy
infantry
can
not
help
being
squeezed
out
of
their
ranks
and
march
with
difficulty
partly
from
actual
pressure
and
partly
from
the
general
confusion
that
ensues
or
supposing
the
wings
are
again
extended
the
troops
have
hardly
recovered
from
their
former
distress
before
they
are
pulled
asunder
and
there
is
a
wide
space
between
the
wings
and
the
men
concerned
lose
confidence
in
themselves
especially
with
an
enemy
close
behind
what
happened
when
a
bridge
had
to
be
crossed
or
other
passage
effected
was
that
each
unit
of
the
force
pressed
on
in
anxiety
to
get
over
first
and
at
these
moments
it
was
easy
for
the
enemy
to
make
an
attack
the
generals
accordingly
having
recognised
the
defect
set
about
curing
it
to
do
so
they
made
six
lochi
or
divisions
of
a
hundred
men
apiece
each
of
which
had
its
own
set
of
captains
and
in
command
of
half
and
quarter
companies
it
was
the
duty
of
these
new
companies
during
a
march
whenever
the
flanks
needed
to
close
in
to
fall
back
to
the
rear
so
as
to
disencumber
the
wings
this
they
did
by
wheeling
clear
of
them
when
the
sides
of
the
oblong
again
extended
they
filled
up
the
interstices
if
the
gap
were
narrow
by
columns
of
companies
if
broader
by
columns
of
or
if
broader
still
by
columns
of
so
that
the
space
between
was
always
filled
up
if
again
it
were
necessary
to
effect
a
passage
by
bridge
or
otherwise
there
was
no
confusion
the
several
companies
crossing
in
turns
or
if
the
occasion
arose
to
form
in
line
of
battle
these
companies
came
up
to
the
front
and
fell
in
in
the
passage
above
i
have
translated
lokhoi
companies
and
as
usual
lokhagoi
captains
the
half
company
is
technically
called
a
pentecostys
and
a
quarter
company
an
enomoty
and
the
officers
in
charge
of
them
respectively
penteconter
and
enomotarch
these
would
be
equivalent
nearly
to
our
subalterns
and
sergeants
and
in
the
evolutions
described
would
act
as
guides
and
markers
in
charge
of
their
sections
grote
thinks
there
were
six
companies
formed
on
each
flank
twelve
in
all
see
hist
of
greece
vol
ix
note
ed
in
this
way
they
advanced
four
stages
but
ere
the
fifth
was
completed
they
came
in
sight
of
a
palace
of
some
sort
with
villages
clustered
round
it
they
could
further

place
pursued
its
course
over
high
undulating
hillocks
the
spur
of
the
mountain
range
under
which
lay
the
village
these
knolls
were
a
welcome
sight
to
the
hellenes
naturally
enough
as
the
enemy
were
cavalry
however
when
they
had
issued
from
the
plain
and
ascended
the
first
crest
and
were
in
the
act
of
descending
it
so
as
to
mount
the
next
at
this
juncture
the
barbarians
came
upon
them
from
the
high
ground
down
the
sheer
steep
they
poured
a
volley
of
darts
slingstones
and
arrows
which
they
discharged
under
the
lash
wounding
many
until
they
got
the
better
of
the
hellenic
light
troops
and
drove
them
for
shelter
behind
the
heavy
infantry
so
that
this
day
that
arm
was
altogether
useless
huddling
in
the
mob
of
sutlers
both
slingers
and
archers
alike
the
persian
leaders
were
seen
flogging
their
men
to
the
attack
cf
herod
vii
but
when
the
hellenes
being
so
pressed
made
an
attempt
to
pursue
they
could
barely
scale
to
the
summit
being
troops
while
the
enemy
as
lightly
sprung
away
and
they
suffered
similarly
in
retiring
to
join
the
rest
of
the
army
and
then
on
the
second
hill
the
whole
had
to
be
gone
through
again
so
that
when
it
came
to
the
third
hillock
they
determined
not
to
move
the
main
body
of
troops
from
their
position
until
they
had
brought
up
a
squadron
of
light
infantry
from
the
right
flank
of
the
square
to
a
point
on
the
mountain
range
when
this
detachment
were
once
posted
above
their
pursuers
the
latter
desisted
from
attacking
the
main
body
in
its
descent
for
fear
of
being
cut
off
and
finding
themselves
between
two
assailants
thus
the
rest
of
the
day
they
moved
on
in
two
divisions
one
set
keeping
to
the
road
by
the
hillocks
the
other
marching
parallel
on
the
higher
level
along
the
mountains
and
thus
they
reached
the
villages
and
appointed
eight
surgeons
to
attend
to
the
many
wounded
here
they
halted
three
days
for
the
sake
of
the
wounded
chiefly
while
a
further
inducement
was
the
plentiful
supply
of
provisions
which
they
found
wheat
and
wine
and
large
stores
of
barley
laid
up
for
horses
these
supplies
had
been
collected
by
the
ruling
satrap
of
the
country
on
the
fourth
day
they
began
their
descent
into
the
plain
but
when
tissaphernes
overtook
them
necessity
taught
them
to
camp
in
the
first
village
they
caught
sight
of
and
give
over
the
attempt
of
marching
and
fighting
simultaneously
as
so
many
were
hors
de
combat
being
either
on
the
list
of
wounded
themselves
or
else
engaged
in
carrying
the
wounded
or
laden
with
the
heavy
arms
of
those
so
occupied
but
when
they
were
once
encamped
and
the
barbarians
advancing
upon
the
village
made
an
attempt
to
harass
them
with
their
the
superiority
of
the
hellenes
was
pronounced
to
sustain
a
running
fight
with
an
enemy
constantly
attacking
was
one
thing
to
keep
him
at
length
from
a
fixed
base
of
action
another
and
the
difference
was
much
in
their
favour
but
when
it
was
late
afternoon
the
time
had
come
for
the
enemy
to
withdraw
since
the
habit
of
the
barbarian
was
never
to
encamp
within
seven
or
eight
miles
of
the
hellenic
camp
this
he
did
in
apprehension
of
a
night
attack
for
a
persian
army
is
good
for
nothing
at
night
their
horses
are
haltered
and
as
a
rule
hobbled
as
well
to
prevent
their
escaping
as
they
might
if
loose
so
that
if
any
alarm
occurs
the
trooper
has
to
saddle
and
bridle
his
horse
and
then
he
must
put
on
his
own
cuirass
and
then
mount
all
which
performances
are
difficult
at
night
and
in
the
midst
of
confusion
for
this
reason
they
always
encamped
at
a
distance
from
the
hellenes
when
the
hellenes
perceived
that
they
were
preparing
to
retire
and
that
the
order
was
being
given
the
herald
cry
pack
up
for
starting
might
be
heard
before
the
enemy
was
fairly
out
of
earshot
for
a
while
the
asiatics
paused
as
if
unwilling
to
be
gone
but
as
night
closed
in
off
they
went
for
it
did
not
suit
their
notions
of
expediency
to
set
off
on
a
march
and
arrive
by
night
and
now
when
the
hellenes
saw
that
they
were
really
and
clearly
gone
they
too
broke
up
their
camp
and
pursued
their
march
till
they
had
traversed
seven
and
a
half
miles
thus
the
distance
between
the
two
armies
grew
to
be
so
great
that
the
next
day
the
enemy
did
not
appear
at
all
nor
yet
on
the
third
day
but
on
the
fourth
the
barbarians
had
pushed
on
by
a
forced
night
march
and
occupied
a
commanding
position
on
the
right
where
the
hellenes
had
to
pass
it
was
a
narrow
mountain
spur
overhanging
the
descent
into
the
plain
lit
a
mere
nail
tip
but
when
cheirisophus
saw
that
this
ridge
was
occupied
he
summoned
xenophon
from
the
rear
bidding
him
at
the
same
time
to
bring
up
peltasts
to
the
front
that
xenophon
hesitated
to
do
for
tissaphernes
and
his
whole
army
were
coming
up
and
were
well
within
sight
galloping
up
to
the
front
himself
he
asked
why
do
you
summon
me
the
other
answered
him
the
reason
is
plain
look
yonder
this
crest
which
overhangs
our
descent
has
been
occupied
there
is
no
passing
until
we
have
dislodged
these
fellows
why
have
you
not
brought
up
the
light
infantry
xenophon
explained
he
had
not
thought
it
desirable
to
leave
the
rear
unprotected
with
an
enemy
appearing
in
the
field
of
view
however
it
is
time
he
added
to
decide
how
we
are
to
dislodge
these
fellows
from
the
crest
at
this
moment
his
eye
fell
on
the
peak
of
the
mountain
rising
immediately
above
their
army
and
he
could
see
an
approach
leading
from
it
to
the
crest
in
question
where
the
enemy
lay
he
exclaimed
the
best
thing
we
can
do
cheirisophus
is
to
make
a
dash
at
the
height
itself
and
with
what
speed
we
may
if
we
take
it
the
party
in
command
of
the
road
will
never
be
able
to
stop
if
you
like
stay
in
command
of
the
army
and
i
will
go
or
if
you
prefer
do
you
go
to
the
mountain
and
i
will
stay
here
i
leave
it
to
you
cheirisophus
answered
to
choose
which
you
like
best
xenophon
remarking
i
am
the
younger
elected
to
go
but
he
stipulated
for
a
detachment
from
the
front
to
accompany
him
since
it
was
a
long
way
to
fetch
up
troops
from
the
rear
accordingly
cheirisophus
furnished
him
with
the
light
infantry
from
the
front
reoccupying
their
place
by
those
from
the
centre
he
also
gave
him
to
form
part
of
the
detachment
the
three
hundred
of
the
picked
corps
under
his
own
command
at
the
head
of
the
square
some
think
that
these
three
hundred
are
three
of
the
detached
companies
described
above
others
that
they
were
a
picked
corps
in
attendance
on
the
they
set
out
from
the
low
ground
with
all
the
haste
imaginable
but
the
enemy
in
position
on
the
crest
no
sooner
perceived
their
advance
upon
the
summit
of
the
pass
than
they
themselves
set
off
full
tilt
in
a
rival
race
for
the
summit
too
hoarse
were
the
shouts
of
the
hellenic
troops
as
the
men
cheered
their
companions
forwards
and
hoarse
the
answering
shouts
from
the
troops
of
tissaphernes
urging
on
theirs
xenophon
mounted
on
his
charger
rode
beside
his
men
and
roused
their
ardour
the
while
now
for
it
brave
sirs
bethink
you
that
this
race
is
for
hellas
now
or
never
to
find
your
boys
your
wives
one
small
effort
and
the
rest
of
the
march
we
shall
pursue
in
peace
without
ever
a
blow
to
strike
now
for
it
but
soteridas
the
sicyonian
said
we
are
not
on
equal
terms
xenophon
you
are
mounted
on
a
horse
i
can
hardly
get
along
with
my
shield
to
carry
and
he
on
hearing
the
reproach
leapt
from
his
horse
in
another
instant
he
had
pushed
soteridas
from
the
ranks
snatched
from
him
his
shield
and
begun
marching
as
quickly
as
he
might
under
the
circumstances
having
his
horseman
cuirass
to
carry
as
well
so
that
he
was
sore
pressed
but
he
continued
to
cheer
on
the
troops
exhorting
those
in
front
to
lead
on
and
the
men
toiling
behind
to
follow
up
soteridas
was
not
spared
by
the
rest
of
the
men
they
gave
him
blows
they
pelted
him
they
showered
him
with
abuse
till
they
compelled
him
to
take
back
his
shield
and
march
on
and
the
other
remounting
led
them
on
horseback
as
long
as
the
footing
held
but
when
the
ground
became
too
steep
he
left
his
horse
and
pressed
forward
on
foot
and
so
they
found
themselves
on
the
summit
before
the
enemy
some
mss
and
the
men
behind
to
pass
him
by
as
he
could
but
ill
keep
up
the
pace
v
there
and
then
the
barbarians
turned
and
fled
as
best
they
might
and
the
hellenes
held
the
summit
while
the
troops
with
tissaphernes
and
ariaeus
turned
aside
and
disappeared
by
another
road
the
main
body
with
cheirisophus
made
its
way
down
into
the
plain
and
encamped
in
a
village
filled
with
good
things
of
divers
sorts
nor
did
this
village
stand
alone
there
were
others
not
a
few
in
this
plain
of
the
tigris
equally
overflowing
with
plenty
it
was
now
afternoon
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
enemy
came
in
sight
on
the
plain
and
succeeded
in
cutting
down
some
of
the
hellenes
belonging
to
parties
who
were
scattered
over
the
flat
land
in
quest
of
spoil
indeed
many
herds
of
cattle
had
been
caught
whilst
being
conveyed
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
now
tissaphernes
and
his
troops
made
an
attempt
to
burn
the
villages
and
some
of
the
hellenes
were
disposed
to
take
the
matter
deeply
to
heart
being
apprehensive
that
they
might
not
know
where
to
get
provisions
if
the
enemy
burnt
the
villages
cheirisophus
and
his
men
were
returning
from
their
sally
of
defence
when
xenophon
and
his
party
descended
and
the
latter
rode
along
the
ranks
as
the
rescuing
party
came
up
and
greeted
them
thus
do
you
not
see
men
of
hellas
they
admit
that
the
country
is
now
ours
what
they
stipulated
against
our
doing
when
they
made
the
treaty
viz
that
we
were
not
to
fire
the
king
country
they
are
now
themselves
doing
setting
fire
to
it
as
if
it
were
not
their
own
but
we
will
be
even
with
them
if
they
leave
provisions
for
themselves
anywhere
there
also
shall
they
see
us
marching
and
turning
to
cheirisophus
he
added
but
it
strikes
me
we
should
sally
forth
against
these
incendiaries
and
protect
our
country
cheirisophus
retorted
that
is
not
quite
my
view
i
say
let
us
do
a
little
burning
ourselves
and
they
will
cease
all
the
quicker
when
they
had
got
back
to
the
villages
while
the
rest
were
busy
about
provisions
the
generals
and
officers
met
and
here
there
was
deep
despondency
for
on
the
one
side
were
exceedingly
high
mountains
on
the
other
a
river
of
such
depth
that
they
failed
to
reach
the
bottom
with
their
spears
in
the
midst
of
their
perplexities
a
rhodian
came
up
with
a
proposal
as
follows
i
am
ready
sirs
to
carry
you
across
four
thousand
heavy
infantry
at
a
time
if
you
will
furnish
me
with
what
i
need
and
give
me
a
talent
into
the
bargain
for
my
pains
when
asked
what
shall
you
need
he
replied
two
thousand
i
see
there
are
plenty
of
sheep
and
goats
and
asses
they
have
only
to
be
flayed
and
their
skins
inflated
and
they
will
readily
give
us
a
passage
i
shall
want
also
the
straps
which
you
use
for
the
baggage
animals
with
these
i
shall
couple
the
skins
to
one
another
then
i
shall
moor
each
skin
by
attaching
stones
and
letting
them
down
like
anchors
into
the
water
then
i
shall
carry
them
across
and
when
i
have
fastened
the
links
at
both
ends
i
shall
place
layers
of
wood
on
them
and
a
coating
of
earth
on
the
top
of
that
you
will
see
in
a
minute
that
there
no
danger
of
your
drowning
for
every
skin
will
be
able
to
support
a
couple
of
men
without
sinking
and
the
wood
and
earth
will
prevent
your
slipping
off
the
generals
thought
it
a
pretty
invention
enough
but
its
realisation
impracticable
for
on
the
other
side
were
masses
of
cavalry
posted
and
ready
to
bar
the
passage
who
to
begin
with
would
not
suffer
the
first
detachment
of
crossers
to
carry
out
any
item
of
the
programme
under
these
circumstances
the
next
day
they
turned
right
about
face
and
began
retracing
their
steps
in
the
direction
of
babylon
to
the
unburnt
villages
having
previously
set
fire
to
those
they
left
so
that
the
enemy
did
not
ride
up
to
them
but
stood
and
stared
all
agape
to
see
in
what
direction
the
hellenes
would
betake
themselves
and
what
they
were
minded
to
do
here
again
while
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
were
busy
about
provisions
the
generals
and
officers
met
in
council
and
after
collecting
the
prisoners
together
submitted
them
to
a
touching
the
whole
country
round
the
names
and
so
forth
of
each
district
the
prisoners
informed
them
that
the
regions
south
through
which
they
had
come
belonged
to
the
district
towards
babylon
and
media
the
road
east
led
to
susa
and
ecbatana
where
the
king
is
said
to
spend
summer
and
spring
crossing
the
river
the
road
west
led
to
lydia
and
ionia
and
the
part
through
the
mountains
facing
towards
the
great
bear
led
they
said
to
the
carduchians
they
were
a
people
so
said
the
prisoners
dwelling
up
on
the
hills
addicted
to
war
and
not
subject
to
the
king
so
much
so
that
once
when
a
royal
army
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
strong
had
invaded
them
not
a
man
came
back
owing
to
the
intricacies
of
the
country
occasionally
however
they
made
truce
or
treaty
with
the
satrap
in
the
plain
and
for
the
nonce
there
would
be
intercourse
they
will
come
in
and
out
amongst
us
and
we
will
go
in
and
out
amongst
them

writers
knew
of
a
small
kingdom
here
at
the
time
of
the
roman
occupation
ruled
by
native
princes
who
after
tigranes
ii
about
recognised
the
overlordship
of
the
armenian
king
later
it
became
a
province
of
the
sassanid
kingdom
and
as
such
was
in
handed
over
among
the
regiones
transtigritanae
to
the
roman
empire
but
in
was
again
ceded
to
persia
after
hearing
these
statements
the
generals
seated
apart
those
who
claimed
to
have
any
special
knowledge
of
the
country
in
any
direction
they
put
them
to
sit
apart
without
making
it
clear
which
particular
route
they
intended
to
take
finally
the
resolution
to
which
they
came
was
that
they
must
force
a
passage
through
the
hills
into
the
territory
of
the
kurds
since
according
to
what
their
informants
told
them
when
they
had
once
passed
these
they
would
find
themselves
in
armenia
the
rich
and
large
territory
governed
by
orontas
and
from
armenia
it
would
be
easy
to
proceed
in
any
direction
whatever
thereupon
they
offered
sacrifice
so
as
to
be
ready
to
start
on
the
march
as
soon
as
the
right
moment
appeared
to
have
arrived
their
chief
fear
was
that
the
high
pass
over
the
mountains
must
be
occupied
in
advance
and
a
general
order
was
issued
that
after
supper
every
one
should
get
his
kit
together
for
starting
and
repose
in
readiness
to
follow
as
soon
as
the
word
of
command
was
given
book
iv
in
the
preceding
portion
of
the
narrative
a
full
account
is
given
of
the
incidents
of
the
march
up
to
the
battle
and
of
the
occurrences
after
the
battle
during
the
truce
which
was
established
between
the
king
and
the
hellenes
who
marched
up
with
cyrus
and
thirdly
of
the
fighting
to
which
the
hellenes
were
exposed
after
the
king
and
tissaphernes
had
broken
the
treaty
while
a
persian
army
hung
on
their
rear
having
finally
reached
a
point
at
which
the
tigris
was
absolutely
impassable
owing
to
its
depth
and
breadth
while
there
was
no
passage
along
the
bank
itself
and
the
carduchian
hills
hung
sheer
over
the
river
the
generals
took
the
resolution
above
mentioned
of
forcing
a
passage
through
the
mountains
the
information
derived
from
the
prisoners
taken
along
the
way
led
them
to
believe
that
once
across
the
carduchian
mountains
they
would
have
the
choice
either
of
crossing
the
tigris
if
they
liked
to
do
so
at
its
sources
in
armenia
or
of
going
round
them
if
so
they
preferred
report
further
said
that
the
sources
of
the
euphrates
also
were
not
far
from
those
of
the
tigris
and
this
is
actually
the
case
the
advance
into
the
country
of
the
carduchians
was
conducted
with
a
view
partly
to
secrecy
and
partly
to
speed
so
as
to
effect
their
entry
before
the
enemy
could
occupy
the
passes
i
it
was
now
about
the
last
watch
and
enough
of
the
night
remained
to
allow
them
to
cross
the
valley
under
cover
of
darkness
when
at
the
word
of
command
they
rose
and
set
off
on
their
march
reaching
the
mountains
at
daybreak
at
this
stage
of
the
march
cheirisophus
at
the
head
of
his
own
division
with
the
whole
of
the
light
troops
led
the
van
while
xenophon
followed
behind
with
the
heavy
infantry
of
the
rearguard
but
without
any
light
troops
since
there
seemed
to
be
no
danger
of
pursuit
or
attack
from
the
rear
while
they
were
making
their
way
up
hill
cheirisophus
reached
the
summit
without
any
of
the
enemy
perceiving
him
then
he
led
on
slowly
and
the
rest
of
the
army
followed
wave
upon
wave
cresting
the
summit
and
descending
into
the
villages
which
nestled
in
the
hollows
and
recesses
of
the
hills
thereupon
the
carduchians
abandoned
their
dwelling
places
and
with
their
wives
and
children
fled
to
the
mountains
so
there
was
plenty
of
provisions
to
be
got
for
the
mere
trouble
of
taking
and
the
homesteads
too
were
well
supplied
with
a
copious
store
of
bronze
vessels
and
utensils
which
the
hellenes
kept
their
hands
off
abstaining
at
the
same
time
from
all
pursuit
of
the
folk
themselves
gently
handling
them
in
hopes
that
the
carduchians
might
be
willing
to
give
them
friendly
passage
through
their
country
since
they
too
were
enemies
of
the
king
only
they
helped
themselves
to
such
provisions
as
fell
in
their
way
which
indeed
was
a
sheer
necessity
but
the
carduchians
neither
gave
ear
when
they
called
to
them
nor
showed
any
other
friendly
sign
and
now
as
the
last
of
the
hellenes
descended
into
the
villages
from
the
pass
they
were
already
in
the
dark
since
owing
to
the
narrowness
of
the
road
the
whole
day
had
been
spent
in
the
ascent
and
descent
at
that
instant
a
party
of
the
carduchians
who
had
collected
made
an
attack
on
the
hindmost
men
killing
some
and
wounding
others
with
stones
and
arrows
though
it
was
quite
a
small
body
who
attacked
the
fact
was
the
approach
of
the
hellenic
army
had
taken
them
by
surprise
if
however
they
had
mustered
in
larger
force
at
this
time
the
chances
are
that
a
large
portion
of
the
army
would
have
been
annihilated
as
it
was
they
got
into
quarters
and
bivouacked
in
the
villages
that
night
while
the
carduchians
kept
many
blazing
in
a
circle
on
the
mountains
and
kept
each
other
in
sight
all
round
but
with
the
dawn
the
generals
and
officers
of
the
hellenes
met
and
resolved
to
proceed
taking
only
the
necessary
number
of
stout
baggage
animals
and
leaving
the
weaklings
behind
they
resolved
further
to
let
go
free
all
the
slaves
in
the
host
for
the
pace
of
the
march
was
necessarily
rendered
slow
by
the
quantity
of
animals
and
prisoners
and
the
number
of
in
attendance
on
these
was
excessive
while
with
such
a
crowd
of
human
beings
to
satisfy
twice
the
amount
of
provisions
had
to
be
procured
and
carried
these
resolutions
passed
they
caused
a
proclamation
by
herald
to
be
made
for
their
enforcement
when
they
had
breakfasted
and
the
march
recommenced
the
generals
planted
themselves
a
little
to
one
side
in
a
narrow
place
and
when
they
found
any
of
the
aforesaid
slaves
or
other
property
still
retained
they
confiscated
them
the
soldiers
yielded
obedience
except
where
some
smuggler
prompted
by
desire
of
a
boy
or
woman
managed
to
make
off
with
his
prize
during
this
day
they
contrived
to
get
along
after
a
fashion
now
fighting
and
now
resting
but
on
the
next
day
they
were
visited
by
a
great
storm
in
spite
of
which
they
were
obliged
to
continue
the
march
owing
to
insufficiency
of
provisions
cheirisophus
was
as
usual
leading
in
front
while
xenophon
headed
the
rearguard
when
the
enemy
began
a
violent
and
sustained
attack
at
one
narrow
place
after
another
they
came
up
quite
close
pouring
in
volleys
of
arrows
and
slingstones
so
that
the
hellenes
had
no
choice
but
to
make
sallies
in
pursuit
and
then
again
recoil
making
but
very
little
progress
over
and
over
again
xenophon
would
send
an
order
to
the
front
to
slacken
pace
when
the
enemy
were
pressing
their
attack
severely
as
a
rule
when
the
word
was
so
passed
up
cheirisophus
slackened
but
sometimes
instead
of
slackening
cheirisophus
quickened
sending
down
a
to
the
rear
to
follow
on
quickly
it
was
clear
that
there
was
something
or
other
happening
but
there
was
no
time
to
go
to
the
front
and
discover
the
cause
of
the
hurry
under
the
circumstances
the
march
at
any
rate
in
the
rear
became
very
like
a
rout
and
here
a
brave
man
lost
his
life
cleonymus
the
laconian
shot
with
an
arrow
in
the
ribs
right
through
shield
and
corselet
as
also
basias
an
arcadian
shot
clean
through
the
head
as
soon
as
they
reached
a
xenophon
without
more
ado
came
up
to
cheirisophus
and
took
him
to
task
for
not
having
waited
whereby
he
said
we
were
forced
to
fight
and
flee
at
the
same
moment
and
now
it
has
cost
us
the
lives
of
two
fine
fellows
they
are
dead
and
we
were
not
able
to
pick
up
their
bodies
or
bury
them
cheirisophus
answered
look
up
there
pointing
as
he
spoke
to
the
mountain
do
you
see
how
inaccessible
it
all
is
only
this
one
road
which
you
see
going
straight
up
and
on
it
all
that
crowd
of
men
who
have
seized
and
are
guarding
the
single
exit
that
is
why
i
hastened
on
and
why
i
could
not
wait
for
you
hoping
to
be
beforehand
with
them
yonder
in
seizing
the
pass
the
guides
we
have
got
say
there
is
no
other
way
and
xenophon
replied
but
i
have
got
two
prisoners
also
the
enemy
annoyed
us
so
much
that
we
laid
an
ambuscade
for
them
which
also
gave
us
time
to
recover
our
breaths
we
killed
some
of
them
and
did
our
best
to
catch
one
or
two
alive
for
this
very
reason
that
we
might
have
guides
who
knew
the
country
to
depend
upon
the
two
were
brought
up
at
once
and
questioned
separately
did
they
know
of
any
other
road
than
the
one
visible
the
first
said
no
and
in
spite
of
all
sorts
of
terrors
applied
to
extract
a
better
answer
no
he
persisted
when
nothing
could
be
got
out
of
him
he
was
killed
before
the
eyes
of
his
fellow
this
latter
then
explained
yonder
man
said
he
did
not
know
because
he
has
got
a
daughter
married
to
a
husband
in
those
parts
i
can
take
you
he
added
by
a
good
road
practicable
even
for
beasts
and
when
asked
whether
there
was
any
point
on
it
difficult
to
pass
he
replied
that
there
was
a
col
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
pass
unless
it
were
occupied
in
advance
then
it
was
resolved
to
summon
the
officers
of
the
light
infantry
and
some
of
those
of
the
heavy
infantry
and
to
acquaint
them
with
the
state
of
affairs
and
ask
them
whether
any
of
them
were
minded
to
distinguish
themselves
and
would
step
forward
as
volunteers
on
an
expedition
two
or
three
heavy
infantry
soldiers
stepped
forward
at
once
two
arcadians
aristonymus
of
methydrium
and
agasias
of
stymphalus
and
in
emulation
of
these
a
third
also
an
arcadian
callimachus
from
parrhasia
who
said
he
was
ready
to
go
and
would
get
volunteers
from
the
whole
army
to
join
him
i
know
he
added
there
will
be
no
lack
of
youngsters
to
follow
where
i
lead
after
that
they
asked
were
there
any
captains
of
light
infantry
willing
to
accompany
the
expedition
aristeas
a
chian
who
on
several
occasions
proved
his
usefulness
to
the
army
on
such
service
volunteered
ii
it
was
already
late
afternoon
when
they
ordered
the
storming
party
to
take
a
snatch
of
food
and
set
off
then
they
bound
the
guide
and
handed
him
over
to
them
the
agreement
was
that
if
they
succeeded
in
taking
the
summit
they
were
to
guard
the
position
that
night
and
at
daybreak
to
give
a
signal
by
bugle
at
this
signal
the
party
on
the
summit
were
to
attack
the
enemy
in
occupation
of
the
visible
pass
while
the
generals
with
the
main
body
would
bring
up
their
succours
making
their
way
up
with
what
speed
they
might
with
this
understanding
off
they
set
two
thousand
strong
and
there
was
a
heavy
downpour
of
rain
but
xenophon
with
his
rearguard
began
advancing
to
the
visible
pass
so
that
the
enemy
might
fix
his
attention
on
this
road
and
the
party
creeping
round
might
as
much
as
possible
elude
observation
now
when
the
rearguard
so
advancing
had
reached
a
ravine
which
they
must
cross
in
order
to
strike
up
the
steep
at
that
instant
the
barbarians
began
rolling
down
great
boulders
each
a
wagon
load
some
larger
some
smaller
against
the
rocks
they
crashed
and
splintered
flying
like
slingstones
in
every
direction
so
that
it
was
absolutely
out
of
the
question
even
to
approach
the
entrance
of
the
pass
some
of
the
officers
finding
themselves
baulked
at
this
point
kept
trying
other
ways
nor
did
they
desist
till
darkness
set
in
and
then
when
they
thought
they
would
not
be
seen
retiring
they
returned
to
supper
some
of
them
who
had
been
on
duty
in
the
rearguard
had
had
no
breakfast
it
so
happened
however
the
enemy
never
ceased
rolling
down
their
stones
all
through
the
night
as
was
easy
to
infer
from
the
booming
sound
several
ton
weight
the
party
with
the
guide
made
a
circuit
and
surprised
the
guards
seated
round
their
fire
and
after
killing
some
and
driving
out
the
rest
took
their
places
thinking
that
they
were
in
possession
of
the
height
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
not
for
above
them
lay
a
hill
skirted
by
the
narrow
road
on
which
they
had
found
the
guards
seated
still
from
the
spot
in
question
there
was
an
approach
to
the
enemy
who
were
seated
on
the
pass
before
mentioned
or
mamelon
here
then
they
passed
the
night
but
at
the
first
glimpse
of
dawn
they
marched
stealthily
and
in
battle
order
against
the
enemy
there
was
a
mist
so
that
they
could
get
quite
close
without
being
observed
but
as
soon
as
they
caught
sight
of
one
another
the
trumpet
sounded
and
with
a
loud
cheer
they
rushed
upon
the
fellows
who
did
not
wait
their
coming
but
left
the
road
and
made
off
with
the
loss
of
only
a
few
lives
however
so
nimble
were
they
cheirisophus
and
his
men
catching
the
sound
of
the
bugle
charged
up
by
the
road
while
others
of
the
generals
pushed
their
way
up
by
pathless
routes
where
each
division
chanced
to
be
the
men
mounting
as
they
were
best
able
and
hoisting
one
another
up
by
means
of
their
spears
and
these
were
the
first
to
unite
with
the
party
who
had
already
taken
the
position
by
storm
xenophon
with
the
rearguard
followed
the
path
which
the
party
with
the
guide
had
taken
since
it
was
easiest
for
the
beasts
of
burthen
one
half
of
his
men
he
had
posted
in
rear
of
the
baggage
animals
the
other
half
he
had
with
himself
in
their
course
they
encountered
a
crest
above
the
road
occupied
by
the
enemy
whom
they
must
either
dislodge
or
be
themselves
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
the
men
by
themselves
could
have
taken
the
same
route
as
the
rest
but
the
baggage
animals
could
not
mount
by
any
other
way
than
this
here
then
with
shouts
of
encouragement
to
each
other
they
dashed
at
the
hill
with
their
storming
columns
not
from
all
sides
but
leaving
an
avenue
of
escape
for
the
enemy
if
he
chose
to
avail
himself
of
it
for
a
while
as
the
men
scrambled
up
where
each
best
could
the
natives
kept
up
a
fire
of
arrows
and
darts
yet
did
not
receive
them
at
close
quarters
but
presently
left
the
position
in
flight
no
sooner
however
were
the
hellenes
safely
past
this
crest
than
they
came
in
sight
of
another
in
front
of
them
also
occupied
and
deemed
it
advisable
to
storm
it
also
but
now
it
struck
xenophon
that
if
they
left
the
ridge
just
taken
unprotected
in
their
rear
the
enemy
might
it
and
attack
the
baggage
animals
as
they
filed
past
presenting
a
long
extended
line
owing
to
the
narrowness
of
the
road
by
which
they
made
their
way
to
obviate
this
he
left
some
officers
in
charge
of
the
ridge
cephisodorus
son
of
cephisophon
an
athenian
amphicrates
the
son
of
amphidemus
an
athenian
and
archagoras
an
argive
exile
while
he
in
person
with
the
rest
of
the
men
attacked
the
second
ridge
this
they
took
in
the
same
fashion
only
to
find
that
they
had
still
a
third
knoll
left
far
the
steepest
of
the
three
this
was
none
other
than
the
mamelon
mentioned
as
above
the
outpost
which
had
been
captured
over
their
fire
by
the
volunteer
storming
party
in
the
night
but
when
the
hellenes
were
close
the
natives
to
the
astonishment
of
all
without
a
struggle
deserted
the
knoll
it
was
conjectured
that
they
had
left
their
position
from
fear
of
being
encircled
and
besieged
but
the
fact
was
that
they
from
their
higher
ground
had
been
able
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
rear
and
had
all
made
off
in
this
fashion
to
attack
the
rearguard
so
then
xenophon
with
the
youngest
men
scaled
up
to
the
top
leaving
orders
to
the
rest
to
march
on
slowly
so
as
to
allow
the
hindmost
companies
to
unite
with
them
they
were
to
advance
by
the
road
and
when
they
reached
the
level
to
ground
arms
meanwhile
the
argive
archagoras
arrived
in
full
flight
with
the
announcement
that
they
had
been
dislodged
from
the
first
ridge
and
that
cephisodorus
and
amphicrates
were
slain
with
a
number
of
others
besides
all
in
fact
who
had
not
jumped
down
the
crags
and
so
reached
the
rearguard
after
this
achievement
the
barbarians
came
to
a
crest
facing
the
mamelon
and
xenophon
held
a
colloquy
with
them
by
means
of
an
interpreter
to
negotiate
a
truce
and
demanded
back
the
dead
bodies
these
they
agreed
to
restore
if
he
would
not
burn
their
houses
and
to
these
terms
xenophon
agreed
meanwhile
as
the
rest
of
the
army
filed
past
and
the
colloquy
was
proceeding
all
the
people
of
the
place
had
time
to
gather
gradually
and
the
enemy
formed
and
as
soon
as
the
hellenes
began
to
descend
from
the
mamelon
to
join
the
others
where
the
troops
were
halted
on
rushed
the
foe
in
full
force
with
hue
and
cry
they
reached
the
summit
of
the
mamelon
from
which
xenophon
was
descending
and
began
rolling
down
crags
one
man
leg
was
crushed
to
pieces
xenophon
was
left
by
his
who
carried
off
his
shield
but
eurylochus
of
lusia
an
arcadian
hoplite
ran
up
to
him
and
threw
his
shield
in
front
to
protect
both
of
them
so
the
two
together
beat
a
retreat
and
so
too
the
rest
and
joined
the
serried
ranks
of
the
main
body
to
take
up
position
of
lusi
or
lusia
a
town
or
district
in
northern
arcadia
after
this
the
whole
hellenic
force
united
and
took
up
their
quarters
there
in
numerous
beautiful
dwellings
with
an
ample
store
of
provisions
for
there
was
wine
so
plentiful
that
they
had
it
in
cemented
cisterns
xenophon
and
cheirisophus
arranged
to
recover
the
dead
and
in
return
restored
the
guide
afterwards
they
did
everything
for
the
dead
according
to
the
means
at
their
disposal
with
the
customary
honours
paid
to
good
men
next
day
they
set
off
without
a
guide
and
the
enemy
by
keeping
up
a
continuous
battle
and
occupying
in
advance
every
narrow
place
obstructed
passage
after
passage
accordingly
whenever
the
van
was
obstructed
xenophon
from
behind
made
a
dash
up
the
hills
and
broke
the
barricade
and
freed
the
vanguard
by
endeavouring
to
get
above
the
obstructing
enemy
whenever
the
rear
was
the
point
attacked
cheirisophus
in
the
same
way
made
a
detour
and
by
endeavouring
to
mount
higher
than
the
barricaders
freed
the
passage
for
the
rear
rank
and
in
this
way
turn
and
turn
about
they
rescued
each
other
and
paid
unflinching
attention
to
their
mutual
needs
at
times
it
happened
that
the
relief
party
having
mounted
encountered
considerable
annoyance
in
their
descent
from
the
barbarians
who
were
so
agile
that
they
allowed
them
to
come
up
quite
close
before
they
turned
back
and
still
escaped
partly
no
doubt
because
the
only
weapons
they
had
to
carry
were
bows
and
slings
they
were
moreover
excellent
archers
using
bows
nearly
three
cubits
long
and
arrows
more
than
two
cubits
when
discharging
the
arrow
they
draw
the
string
by
getting
a
purchase
with
the
left
foot
planted
forward
on
the
lower
end
of
the
bow
the
arrows
pierced
through
shield
and
cuirass
and
the
hellenes
when
they
got
hold
of
them
used
them
as
javelins
fitting
them
to
their
thongs
in
these
districts
the
cretans
were
highly
serviceable
they
were
under
the
command
of
stratocles
a
cretan
iii
during
this
day
they
bivouacked
in
the
villages
which
lie
above
the
plain
of
the
river
centrites
which
is
about
two
hundred
feet
broad
it
is
the
frontier
river
between
armenia
and
the
country
of
the
carduchians
here
the
hellenes
recruited
themselves
and
the
sight
of
the
plain
filled
them
with
joy
for
the
river
was
but
six
or
seven
furlongs
distant
from
the
mountains
of
the
carduchians
for
the
moment
then
they
bivouacked
right
happily
they
had
their
provisions
they
had
also
many
memories
of
the
labours
that
were
now
passed
seeing
that
the
last
seven
days
spent
in
traversing
the
country
of
the
carduchians
had
been
one
long
continuous
battle
which
had
cost
them
more
suffering
than
the
whole
of
their
troubles
at
the
hands
of
the
king
and
tissaphernes
put
together
as
though
they
were
truly
quit
of
them
for
ever
they
laid
their
heads
to
rest
in
sweet
content
the
eastern
tigris
but
with
the
morrow
dawn
they
espied
horsemen
at
a
certain
point
across
the
river
armed
as
if
they
meant
to
dispute
the
passage
infantry
too
drawn
up
in
line
upon
the
banks
above
the
cavalry
threatened
to
prevent
them
debouching
into
armenia
these
troops
were
armenian
and
mardian
and
chaldaean
mercenaries
belonging
to
orontas
and
artuchas
the
last
of
the
three
the
chaldaeans
were
said
to
be
a
free
and
brave
set
of
people
they
were
armed
with
long
wicker
shields
and
lances
the
banks
before
named
on
which
they
were
drawn
up
were
a
hundred
yards
or
more
distant
from
the
river
and
the
single
road
which
was
visible
was
one
leading
upwards
and
looking
like
a
regular
artificially
constructed
highway
at
this
point
the
hellenes
endeavoured
to
cross
but
on
their
making
the
attempt
the
water
proved
to
be
more
than
and
the
river
bed
was
rough
with
great
slippery
stones
and
as
to
holding
their
arms
in
the
water
it
was
out
of
the
question
the
stream
swept
them
away
or
if
they
tried
to
carry
them
over
the
head
the
body
was
left
exposed
to
the
arrows
and
other
missiles
accordingly
they
turned
back
and
encamped
there
by
the
bank
of
the
river
at
the
point
where
they
had
themselves
been
last
night
up
on
the
mountains
they
could
see
the
carduchians
collected
in
large
numbers
and
under
arms
a
shadow
of
deep
despair
again
descended
on
their
souls
whichever
way
they
turned
their
eyes
in
front
lay
the
river
so
difficult
to
ford
over
on
the
other
side
a
new
enemy
threatening
to
bar
the
passage
on
the
hills
behind
the
carduchians
ready
to
fall
upon
their
rear
should
they
once
again
attempt
to
cross
thus
for
this
day
and
night
they
halted
sunk
in
perplexity
but
xenophon
had
a
dream
in
his
sleep
he
thought
that
he
was
bound
in
fetters
but
these
of
their
own
accord
fell
from
off
him
so
that
he
was
loosed
and
could
stretch
his
legs
as
freely
as
he
wished
so
at
the
first
glimpse
of
daylight
he
came
to
cheirisophus
and
told
him
that
he
had
hopes
that
all
things
would
go
well
and
related
to
him
his
dream
it
is
impossible
to
give
the
true
sense
and
humour
of
the
passage
in
english
depending
as
it
does
on
the
double
meaning
of
diabainein
to
cross
a
river
to
stride
or
straddle
of
the
legs
the
army
is
unable
to
cross
the
centrites
xenophon
dreams
that
he
is
fettered
but
the
chains
drop
off
his
legs
and
he
is
able
to
stride
as
freely
as
ever
next
morning
the
two
young
men
come
to
him
with
the
story
how
they
have
found
themselves
able
to
walk
cross
the
river
instead
of
having
to
swim
it
it
is
obvious
to
xenophon
that
the
dream
is
sent
from
heaven
the
other
was
well
pleased
and
with
the
first
faint
gleam
of
dawn
the
generals
all
were
present
and
did
sacrifice
and
the
victims
were
favourable
in
the
first
essay
retiring
from
the
sacrifice
the
generals
and
officers
issued
an
order
to
the
troops
to
take
their
breakfasts
and
while
xenophon
was
taking
his
two
young
men
came
running
up
to
him
for
every
one
knew
that
breakfasting
or
supping
he
was
always
accessible
or
that
even
if
asleep
any
one
was
welcome
to
awaken
him
who
had
anything
to
say
bearing
on
the
business
of
war
what
the
two
young
men
had
at
this
time
to
say
was
that
they
had
been
collecting
brushwood
for
fire
and
had
presently
espied
on
the
opposite
side
in
among
some
rocks
which
came
down
to
the
brink
an
old
man
and
some
women
and
little
girls
depositing
as
it
would
appear
bags
of
clothes
in
a
cavernous
rock
when
they
saw
them
it
struck
them
that
it
was
safe
to
cross
in
any
case
the
cavalry
could
not
approach
at
this
point
so
they
stripped
naked
expecting
to
have
to
swim
for
it
and
with
their
long
knives
in
their
hands
began
crossing
but
going
forward
crossed
without
being
wet
up
to
the
fork
once
across
they
captured
the
clothes
and
came
back
again
accordingly
xenophon
at
once
poured
out
a
libation
himself
and
bade
the
two
young
fellows
fill
the
cup
and
pray
to
the
gods
who
showed
to
him
this
vision
and
to
them
a
passage
to
bring
all
other
blessings
for
them
to
accomplishment
when
he
had
poured
out
the
libation
he
at
once
led
the
two
young
men
to
cheirisophus
and
they
repeated
to
him
their
story
cheirisophus
on
hearing
it
offered
libations
also
and
when
they
had
performed
them
they
sent
a
general
order
to
the
troops
to
pack
up
ready
for
starting
while
they
themselves
called
a
meeting
of
the
generals
and
took
counsel
how
they
might
best
effect
a
passage
so
as
to
overpower
the
enemy
in
front
without
suffering
any
loss
from
the
men
behind
and
they
resolved
that
cheirisophus
should
lead
the
van
and
cross
with
half
the
army
the
other
half
still
remaining
behind
under
xenophon
while
the
baggage
animals
and
the
mob
of
sutlers
were
to
cross
between
the
two
divisions
when
all
was
duly
ordered
the
move
began
the
young
men
pioneering
them
and
keeping
the
river
on
their
left
it
was
about
four
march
to
the
crossing
and
as
they
moved
along
the
bank
the
squadrons
of
cavalry
kept
pace
with
them
on
the
opposite
side
but
when
they
had
reached
a
point
in
a
line
with
the
ford
and
the
banks
of
the
river
they
grounded
arms
and
first
cheirisophus
himself
placed
a
wreath
upon
his
brows
and
throwing
off
his
cloak
resumed
his
arms
passing
the
order
to
all
the
rest
to
do
the
same
and
bade
the
captains
form
their
companies
in
open
order
in
deep
columns
some
to
left
and
some
to
right
of
himself
meanwhile
the
soothsayers
were
slaying
a
victim
over
the
river
and
the
enemy
were
letting
fly
their
arrows
and
slingstones
but
as
yet
they
were
out
of
range
as
soon
as
the
victims
were
favourable
all
the
soldiers
began
singing
the
battle
hymn
and
with
the
notes
of
the
paean
mingled
the
shouting
of
the
men
accompanied
by
the
shriller
chant
of
the
women
for
there
were
many
women
in
the
camp
or
having
doffed
it
the
wreath
an
action
which
the
soldiers
would
perform
symbolically
if
grote
is
right
in
his
interpretation
of
the
passage
hist
of
greece
vol
ix
lit
so
cheirisophus
with
his
detachment
stepped
in
but
xenophon
taking
the
most
of
the
rearguard
began
running
back
at
full
speed
to
the
passage
facing
the
egress
into
the
hills
of
armenia
making
a
feint
of
crossing
at
that
point
to
intercept
their
cavalry
on
the
river
bank
the
enemy
seeing
cheirisophus
detachment
easily
crossing
the
stream
and
xenophon
men
racing
back
were
seized
with
the
fear
of
being
intercepted
and
fled
at
full
speed
in
the
direction
of
the
road
which
emerges
from
the
stream
but
when
they
were
come
opposite
to
it
they
raced
up
hill
towards
their
mountains
then
lycius
who
commanded
the
cavalry
and
aeschines
who
was
in
command
of
the
division
of
light
infantry
attached
to
cheirisophus
no
sooner
saw
them
fleeing
so
lustily
than
they
were
after
them
and
the
soldiers
shouted
not
to
fall
behind
but
to
follow
them
right
up
to
the
mountains
cheirisophus
on
getting
across
forbore
to
pursue
the
cavalry
but
advanced
by
the
bluffs
which
reached
to
the
river
to
attack
the
enemy
overhead
and
these
seeing
their
own
cavalry
fleeing
seeing
also
the
heavy
infantry
advancing
upon
them
abandoned
the
heights
above
the
river
or
to
stick
tight
to
them
and
not
to
be
outdone
or
as
others
understand
the
infantry
soldiers
clamoured
not
to
be
left
behind
but
to
follow
them
up
into
the
mountains
xenophon
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
things
were
going
well
on
the
other
side
fell
back
with
all
speed
to
join
the
troops
engaged
in
crossing
for
by
this
time
the
carduchians
were
well
in
sight
descending
into
the
plain
to
attack
their
rear
cheirisophus
was
in
possession
of
the
higher
ground
and
lycius
with
his
little
squadron
in
an
attempt
to
follow
up
the
pursuit
had
captured
some
stragglers
of
their
and
with
them
some
handsome
apparel
and
the
baggage
animals
of
the
hellenes
and
the
mob
of
were
just
about
to
cross
when
xenonphon
turned
his
troops
right
about
to
face
the
carduchians
he
formed
his
line
passing
the
order
to
the
captains
each
to
form
his
company
into
sections
and
to
deploy
them
into
line
by
the
left
the
captains
of
companies
and
lieutenants
in
command
of
sections
to
advance
to
meet
the
carduchians
while
the
rear
leaders
would
keep
their
position
facing
the
river
but
when
the
carduchians
saw
the
rearguard
so
stript
of
the
mass
and
looking
now
like
a
mere
handful
of
men
they
advanced
all
the
more
quickly
singing
certain
songs
the
while
then
as
matters
were
safe
with
him
cheirisophus
sent
back
the
peltasts
and
slingers
and
archers
to
join
xenophon
with
orders
to
carry
out
his
instructions
they
were
in
the
act
of
recrossing
when
xenophon
who
saw
their
intention
sent
a
messenger
across
bidding
them
wait
there
at
the
river
brink
without
crossing
but
as
soon
as
he
and
his
detachment
began
to
cross
they
were
to
step
in
facing
him
in
two
flanking
divisions
right
and
left
of
them
as
if
in
the
act
of
crossing
the
javelin
men
with
their
javelins
on
the
thong
and
the
bowmen
with
their
arrows
on
the
string
but
they
were
not
to
advance
far
into
the
stream
the
order
passed
to
his
own
men
was
wait
till
you
are
within
and
the
shield
rattles
then
sound
the
paean
and
charge
the
enemy
as
soon
as
he
turns
and
the
bugle
from
the
river
sounds
for
attack
you
will
face
about
to
the
right
the
rear
rank
leading
and
the
whole
detachment
falling
back
and
crossing
the
river
as
quickly
as
possible
every
one
preserving
his
original
rank
so
as
to
avoid
tramelling
one
another
the
bravest
man
is
he
who
gets
to
the
other
side
first
the
carduchians
seeing
that
the
remnant
left
was
the
merest
handful
for
many
even
of
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
remain
had
gone
off
in
their
anxiety
to
protect
their
beasts
of
burden
or
their
personal
kit
or
their
mistresses
bore
down
upon
them
valorously
and
opened
fire
with
slingstones
and
arrows
but
the
hellenes
raising
the
battle
hymn
dashed
at
them
at
a
run
and
they
did
not
await
them
armed
well
enough
for
mountain
warfare
and
with
a
view
to
sudden
attack
followed
by
speedy
flight
they
were
not
by
any
means
sufficiently
equipped
for
an
engagement
at
close
quarters
at
this
instant
the
signal
of
the
bugle
was
heard
its
notes
added
wings
to
the
flight
of
the
barbarians
but
the
hellenes
turned
right
about
in
the
opposite
direction
and
betook
themselves
to
the
river
with
what
speed
they
might
some
of
the
enemy
here
a
man
and
there
another
perceived
and
running
back
to
the
river
let
fly
their
arrows
and
wounded
a
few
but
the
majority
even
when
the
hellenes
were
well
across
were
still
to
be
seen
pursuing
their
flight
the
detachment
which
came
to
meet
xenophon
men
carried
away
by
their
valour
advanced
further
than
they
had
need
to
and
had
to
cross
back
again
in
the
rear
of
xenophon
men
and
of
these
too
a
few
were
wounded
iv
the
passage
effected
they
fell
into
line
about
and
marched
through
armenian
territory
one
long
plain
with
smooth
rolling
hillocks
not
less
than
five
parasangs
in
distance
for
owing
to
the
wars
of
this
people
with
the
carduchians
there
were
no
villages
near
the
river
the
village
eventually
reached
was
large
and
possessed
a
palace
belonging
to
the
satrap
and
most
of
the
houses
were
crowned
with
turrets
provisions
were
plentiful
from
this
village
they
marched
two
stages
ten
parasangs
until
they
had
surmounted
the
sources
of
the
river
tigris
and
from
this
point
they
marched
three
stages
fifteen
parasangs
to
the
river
teleboas
this
was
a
fine
stream
though
not
large
and
there
were
many
villages
about
it
the
district
was
named
western
armenia
the
of
it
was
tiribazus
the
king
friend
and
whenever
the
latter
paid
a
visit
he
alone
had
the
privilege
of
mounting
the
king
upon
his
horse
this
officer
rode
up
to
the
hellenes
with
a
body
of
cavalry
and
sending
forward
an
interpreter
stated
that
he
desired
a
colloquy
with
the
leaders
the
generals
resolved
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
and
advancing
on
their
side
to
within
speaking
distance
they
demanded
what
he
wanted
he
replied
that
he
wished
to
make
a
treaty
with
them
in
accordance
with
which
he
on
his
side
would
abstain
from
injuring
the
hellenes
if
they
would
not
burn
his
houses
but
merely
take
such
provisions
as
they
needed
this
proposal
satisfied
the
generals
and
a
treaty
was
made
on
the
terms
suggested
from
this
place
they
marched
three
stages
fifteen
parasangs
through
plain
country
tiribazus
the
while
keeping
close
behind
with
his
own
forces
more
than
a
mile
off
presently
they
reached
a
palace
with
villages
clustered
round
about
it
which
were
full
of
supplies
in
great
variety
but
while
they
were
encamping
in
the
night
there
was
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
and
in
the
morning
it
was
resolved
to
billet
out
the
different
regiments
with
their
generals
throughout
the
villages
there
was
no
enemy
in
sight
and
the
proceeding
seemed
prudent
owing
to
the
quantity
of
snow
in
these
quarters
they
had
for
provisions
all
the
good
things
there
are
sacrificial
beasts
corn
old
wines
with
an
exquisite
bouquet
dried
grapes
and
vegetables
of
all
sorts
but
some
of
the
stragglers
from
the
camp
reported
having
seen
an
army
and
the
blaze
of
many
watchfires
in
the
night
accordingly
the
generals
concluded
that
it
was
not
prudent
to
separate
their
quarters
in
this
way
and
a
resolution
was
passed
to
bring
the
troops
together
again
after
that
they
reunited
the
more
so
that
the
weather
promised
to
be
fine
with
a
clear
sky
but
while
they
lay
there
in
open
quarters
during
the
night
down
came
so
thick
a
fall
of
snow
that
it
completely
covered
up
the
stacks
of
arms
and
the
men
themselves
lying
down
it
cramped
and
crippled
the
baggage
animals
and
there
was
great
unreadiness
to
get
up
so
gently
fell
the
snow
as
they
lay
there
warm
and
comfortable
and
formed
a
blanket
except
where
it
slipped
off
the
sleepers
shoulders
and
it
was
not
until
xenophon
roused
himself
to
get
up
and
without
his
cloak
on
began
to
split
wood
that
quickly
first
one
and
then
another
got
up
and
taking
the
log
away
from
him
fell
to
splitting
thereat
the
rest
followed
suit
got
up
and
began
kindling
fire
and
oiling
their
bodies
for
there
was
a
scented
unguent
to
be
found
there
in
abundance
which
they
used
instead
of
oil
it
was
made
from
pig
fat
sesame
bitter
almonds
and
turpentine
there
was
a
sweet
oil
also
to
be
found
made
of
the
same
ingredients
or
as
we
should
say
in
his
shirt
sleeves
doubtless
he
lay
with
his
imation
or
cloak
loosely
wrapped
round
him
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
he
would
throw
it
off
or
it
would
fall
off
and
with
the
simple
inner
covering
of
the
khiton
to
protect
him
and
arms
free
he
fell
to
chopping
the
wood
only
half
clad
after
this
it
was
resolved
that
they
must
again
separate
their
quarters
and
get
under
cover
in
the
villages
at
this
news
the
soldiers
with
much
joy
and
shouting
rushed
upon
the
covered
houses
and
the
provisions
but
all
who
in
their
blind
folly
had
set
fire
to
the
houses
when
they
left
them
before
now
paid
the
penalty
in
the
poor
quarters
they
got
from
this
place
one
night
they
sent
off
a
party
under
democrates
a
temenite
up
into
the
mountains
where
the
stragglers
reported
having
seen
watchfires
the
leader
selected
was
a
man
whose
judgement
might
be
depended
upon
to
verify
the
truth
of
the
matter
with
a
happy
gift
to
distinguish
between
fact
and
fiction
he
had
often
been
successfully
appealed
to
he
went
and
reported
that
he
had
seen
no
watchfires
but
he
had
got
a
man
whom
he
brought
back
with
him
carrying
a
persian
bow
and
quiver
and
a
sagaris
or
battleaxe
like
those
worn
by
the
amazons
when
asked
from
what
country
he
came
the
prisoner
answered
that
he
was
a
persian
and
was
going
from
the
army
of
tiribazus
to
get
provisions
they
next
asked
him
how
large
the
army
was
and
for
what
object
it
had
been
collected
his
answer
was
that
it
consisted
of
tiribazus
at
the
head
of
his
own
forces
and
aided
by
some
chalybian
and
taochian
mercenaries
tiribazus
had
got
it
together
he
added
meaning
to
attack
the
hellenes
on
the
high
mountain
pass
in
a
defile
which
was
the
sole
passage
reading
temeniten
a
native
of
temenus
a
district
of
syracuse
al
temniten
from
temnus
in
the
aeolid
al
temeniten
from
temenum
in
the
argolid
when
the
generals
heard
this
news
they
resolved
to
collect
the
troops
and
they
set
off
at
once
taking
the
prisoner
to
act
as
guide
and
leaving
a
garrison
behind
with
sophaenetus
the
stymphalian
in
command
of
those
who
remained
in
the
camp
as
soon
as
they
had
begun
to
cross
the
hills
the
light
infantry
advancing
in
front
and
catching
sight
of
the
camp
did
not
wait
for
the
heavy
infantry
but
with
a
loud
shout
rushed
upon
the
enemy
entrenchment
the
natives
hearing
the
din
and
clatter
did
not
care
to
stop
but
took
rapidly
to
their
heels
but
for
all
their
expedition
some
of
them
were
killed
and
as
many
as
twenty
horses
were
captured
with
the
tent
of
tiribazus
and
its
contents
couches
and
goblets
besides
certain
persons
styling
themselves
the
butlers
and
bakers
as
soon
as
the
generals
of
the
heavy
infantry
division
had
learnt
the
news
they
resolved
to
return
to
the
camp
with
all
speed
for
fear
of
an
attack
being
made
on
the
remnant
left
behind
the
recall
was
sounded
and
the
retreat
commenced
the
camp
was
reached
the
same
day
v
the
next
day
it
was
resolved
that
they
should
set
off
with
all
possible
speed
before
the
enemy
had
time
to
collect
and
occupy
the
defile
having
got
their
kit
and
baggage
together
they
at
once
began
their
march
through
deep
snow
with
several
guides
and
crossing
the
high
pass
the
same
day
on
which
tiribazus
was
to
have
attacked
them
got
safely
into
cantonments
from
this
point
they
marched
three
desert
stages
fifteen
parassangs
to
the
river
euphrates
and
crossed
it
in
water
up
to
the
waist
the
sources
of
the
river
were
reported
to
be
at
no
great
distance
from
this
place
they
marched
through
deep
snow
over
a
flat
country
three
stages
fifteen
parasangs
the
last
of
these
marches
was
trying
with
the
north
wind
blowing
in
their
teeth
drying
up
everything
and
benumbing
the
men
here
one
of
the
seers
suggested
to
them
to
do
sacrifice
to
boreas
and
sacrifice
was
done
the
effect
was
obvious
to
all
in
the
diminished
fierceness
of
the
blast
but
there
was
six
feet
of
snow
so
that
many
of
the
baggage
animals
and
slaves
were
lost
and
about
thirty
of
the
men
themselves
al
ten
al
five
they
spent
the
whole
night
in
kindling
fire
for
there
was
fortunately
no
dearth
of
wood
at
the
only
those
who
came
late
into
camp
had
no
wood
accordingly
those
who
had
arrived
a
good
while
and
had
kindled
fires
were
not
for
allowing
these
near
the
fires
unless
they
would
in
return
give
a
share
of
their
corn
or
of
any
other
victuals
they
might
have
here
then
a
general
exchange
of
goods
was
set
up
where
the
fire
was
kindled
the
snow
melted
and
great
trenches
formed
themselves
down
to
the
bare
earth
and
here
it
was
possible
to
measure
the
depth
of
the
snow
leaving
these
quarters
they
marched
the
whole
of
the
next
day
over
snow
and
many
of
the
men
were
afflicted
with
boulimia
or
xenophon
who
was
guarding
the
rear
came
upon
some
men
who
had
dropt
down
and
he
did
not
know
what
ailed
them
but
some
one
who
was
experienced
in
such
matters
suggested
to
him
that
they
had
evidently
got
boulimia
and
if
they
got
something
to
eat
they
would
revive
then
he
went
the
round
of
the
baggage
train
and
laying
an
embargo
on
any
eatables
he
could
see
doled
out
with
his
own
hands
or
sent
off
other
agents
to
distribute
to
the
sufferers
who
as
soon
as
they
had
taken
a
mouthful
got
on
their
legs
again
and
continued
the
march
on
and
on
they
marched
and
about
dusk
cheirisophus
reached
a
village
and
surprised
some
women
and
girls
who
had
come
from
the
village
to
fetch
water
at
the
fountain
outside
the
stockade
these
asked
them
who
they
were
the
interpreters
answered
for
them
in
persian
they
were
on
their
way
from
the
king
to
the
satrap
in
reply
to
which
the
women
gave
them
to
understand
that
the
satrap
was
not
at
home
but
was
away
a
parasang
farther
on
as
it
was
late
they
entered
with
the
within
the
stockade
to
visit
the
headman
of
the
village
accordingly
cheirisophus
and
as
many
of
the
troops
as
were
able
got
into
cantonments
there
while
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
those
namely
who
were
unable
to
complete
the
march
had
to
spend
the
night
out
without
food
and
without
fire
under
the
circumstances
some
of
the
men
perished
on
the
heels
of
the
army
hung
perpetually
bands
of
the
enemy
snatching
away
disabled
baggage
animals
and
fighting
with
each
other
over
the
carcases
and
in
its
track
not
seldom
were
left
to
their
fate
disabled
soldiers
struck
down
with
or
with
toes
mortified
by
frostbite
as
to
the
eyes
it
was
some
alleviation
against
the
snow
to
march
with
something
black
before
them
for
the
feet
the
only
remedy
was
to
keep
in
motion
without
stopping
for
an
instant
and
to
loose
the
sandal
at
night
if
they
went
to
sleep
with
the
sandals
on
the
thong
worked
into
the
feet
and
the
sandals
were
frozen
fast
to
them
this
was
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
since
their
old
sandals
had
failed
they
wore
untanned
brogues
made
of
it
was
owing
to
some
such
dire
necessity
that
a
party
of
men
fell
out
and
were
left
behind
and
seeing
a
patch
of
ground
where
the
snow
had
evidently
disappeared
they
conjectured
it
must
have
been
melted
and
this
was
actually
so
owing
to
a
spring
of
some
sort
which
was
to
be
seen
steaming
up
in
a
dell
close
by
to
this
they
had
turned
aside
and
sat
down
and
were
loth
to
go
a
step
further
but
xenophon
with
his
rearguard
perceived
them
and
begged
and
implored
them
by
all
manner
of
means
not
to
be
left
behind
telling
them
that
the
enemy
were
after
them
in
large
packs
pursuing
and
he
ended
by
growing
angry
they
merely
bade
him
put
a
knife
to
their
throats
not
one
step
farther
would
they
stir
then
it
seemed
best
to
frighten
the
pursuing
enemy
if
possible
and
prevent
their
falling
upon
the
invalids
it
was
already
dusk
and
the
pursuers
were
advancing
with
much
noise
and
hubbub
wrangling
and
disputing
over
their
spoils
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
rearguard
in
the
plenitude
of
health
and
strength
sprang
up
out
of
their
lair
and
run
upon
the
enemy
whilst
those
weary
wights
bawled
out
as
loud
as
their
sick
throats
could
sound
and
clashed
their
spears
against
their
shields
and
the
enemy
in
terror
hurled
themselves
through
the
snow
into
the
dell
and
not
one
of
them
ever
uttered
a
sound
again
hug
after
rehdantz
would
omit
the
words
in
the
plenitude
of
health
and
strength
or
the
invalids
xenophon
and
his
party
telling
the
sick
folk
that
next
day
people
would
come
for
them
set
off
and
before
they
had
gone
half
a
mile
they
fell
in
with
some
soldiers
who
had
laid
down
to
rest
on
the
snow
with
their
cloaks
wrapped
round
them
but
never
a
guard
was
established
and
they
made
them
get
up
their
explanation
was
that
those
in
front
would
not
move
on
passing
by
this
group
he
sent
forward
the
strongest
of
his
light
infantry
in
advance
with
orders
to
find
out
what
the
stoppage
was
they
reported
that
the
whole
army
lay
reposing
in
such
fashion
that
being
so
xenophon
men
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
bivouac
in
the
open
air
also
without
fire
and
supperless
merely
posting
what
pickets
they
could
under
the
circumstances
but
as
soon
as
it
drew
towards
day
xenophon
despatched
the
youngest
of
his
men
to
the
sick
folk
behind
with
orders
to
make
them
get
up
and
force
them
to
proceed
meanwhile
cheirisophus
had
sent
some
of
his
men
quartered
in
the
village
to
enquire
how
they
fared
in
the
rear
they
were
overjoyed
to
see
them
and
handed
over
the
sick
folk
to
them
to
carry
into
camp
while
they
themselves
continued
their
march
forward
and
ere
twenty
furlongs
were
past
reached
the
village
in
which
cheirisophus
was
quartered
as
soon
as
the
two
divisions
were
met
the
resolution
was
come
to
that
it
would
be
safe
to
billet
the
regiments
throughout
the
villages
cheirisophus
remained
where
he
was
while
the
rest
drew
lots
for
the
villages
in
sight
and
then
with
their
several
detachments
marched
off
to
their
respective
destinations
it
was
here
that
polycrates
an
athenian
and
captain
of
a
company
asked
for
leave
of
absence
he
wished
to
be
off
on
a
quest
of
his
own
and
putting
himself
at
the
head
of
the
active
men
of
the
division
he
ran
to
the
village
which
had
been
allotted
to
xenophon
he
surprised
within
it
the
villagers
with
their
headman
and
seventeen
young
horses
which
were
being
reared
as
a
tribute
for
the
king
and
last
of
all
the
headman
own
daughter
a
young
bride
only
eight
days
wed
her
husband
had
gone
off
to
chase
hares
and
so
he
escaped
being
taken
with
the
other
villagers
the
houses
were
underground
structures
with
an
aperture
like
the
mouth
of
a
well
by
which
to
enter
but
they
were
broad
and
spacious
below
the
entrance
for
the
beasts
of
burden
was
dug
out
but
the
human
occupants
descended
by
a
ladder
in
these
dwellings
were
to
be
found
goats
and
sheep
and
cattle
and
cocks
and
hens
with
their
various
progeny
the
flocks
and
herds
were
all
reared
under
cover
upon
green
food
there
were
stores
within
of
wheat
and
barley
and
vegetables
and
wine
made
from
barley
in
great
big
bowls
the
grains
of
barley
malt
lay
floating
in
the
beverage
up
to
the
lip
of
the
vessel
and
reeds
lay
in
them
some
longer
some
shorter
without
joints
when
you
were
thirsty
you
must
take
one
of
these
into
your
mouth
and
suck
the
beverage
without
admixture
of
water
was
very
strong
and
of
a
delicious
flavour
to
certain
palates
but
the
taste
must
be
acquired
xenophon
made
the
headman
of
the
village
his
guest
at
supper
and
bade
him
keep
a
good
heart
so
far
from
robbing
him
of
his
children
they
would
fill
his
house
full
of
good
things
in
return
for
what
they
took
before
they
went
away
only
he
must
set
them
an
example
and
discover
some
blessing
or
other
for
the
army
until
they
found
themselves
with
another
tribe
to
this
he
readily
assented
and
with
the
utmost
cordiality
showed
them
the
cellar
where
the
wine
was
buried
for
this
night
then
having
taken
up
their
several
quarters
as
described
they
slumbered
in
the
midst
of
plenty
one
and
all
with
the
headman
under
watch
and
ward
and
his
children
with
him
safe
in
sight
but
on
the
following
day
xenophon
took
the
headman
and
set
off
to
cheirisophus
making
a
round
of
the
villages
and
at
each
place
turning
in
to
visit
the
different
parties
everywhere
alike
he
found
them
faring
sumptuously
and
there
was
not
a
single
village
where
they
did
not
insist
on
setting
a
breakfast
before
them
and
on
the
same
table
were
spread
half
a
dozen
dishes
at
least
lamb
kid
pork
veal
fowls
with
various
sorts
of
bread
some
of
wheat
and
some
of
barley
when
as
an
act
of
courtesy
any
one
wished
to
drink
his
neighbour
health
he
would
drag
him
to
the
big
bowl
and
when
there
he
must
duck
his
head
and
take
a
long
pull
drinking
like
an
ox
the
headman
they
insisted
everywhere
must
accept
as
a
present
whatever
he
liked
to
have
but
he
would
accept
nothing
except
where
he
espied
any
of
his
relations
when
he
made
a
point
of
taking
them
off
him
or
her
with
himself
when
they
reached
cheirisophus
they
found
a
similar
scene
there
too
the
men
were
feasting
in
their
quarters
garlanded
with
whisps
of
hay
and
dry
grass
and
armenian
boys
were
playing
the
part
of
waiters
in
barbaric
costumes
only
they
had
to
point
out
by
gesture
to
the
boys
what
they
were
to
do
like
deaf
and
dumb
after
the
first
formalities
when
cheirisophus
and
xenophon
had
greeted
one
another
like
bosom
friends
they
interrogated
the
headman
in
common
by
means
of
the
interpreter
what
was
the
country
they
asked
he
replied
armenia
and
again
for
whom
are
the
horses
being
bred
they
are
tribute
for
the
king
he
replied
and
the
neighbouring
country
is
the
land
of
the
chalybes
he
said
and
he
described
the
road
which
led
to
it
so
for
the
present
xenophon
went
off
taking
the
headman
back
with
him
to
his
household
and
friends
he
also
made
him
a
present
of
an
oldish
horse
which
he
had
got
he
had
heard
that
the
headman
was
a
priest
of
the
sun
and
so
he
could
fatten
up
the
beast
and
sacrifice
him
otherwise
he
was
afraid
it
might
die
outright
for
it
had
been
injured
by
the
long
marching
for
himself
he
took
his
pick
of
the
colts
and
gave
a
colt
apiece
to
each
of
his
and
officers
the
horses
here
were
smaller
than
the
persian
horses
but
much
more
spirited
it
was
here
too
that
their
friend
the
headman
explained
to
them
how
they
should
wrap
small
bags
or
sacks
around
the
feet
of
the
horses
and
other
cattle
when
marching
through
the
snow
for
without
such
precautions
the
creatures
sank
up
to
their
bellies
vi
when
a
week
had
passed
on
the
eighth
day
xenophon
delivered
over
the
guide
that
is
to
say
the
village
headman
to
cheirisophus
he
left
the
headman
household
safe
behind
in
the
village
with
the
exception
of
his
son
a
lad
in
the
bloom
of
youth
this
boy
was
entrusted
to
episthenes
of
amphipolis
to
guard
if
the
headman
proved
himself
a
good
guide
he
was
to
take
away
his
son
also
at
his
departure
they
finally
made
his
house
the
repository
of
all
the
good
things
they
could
contrive
to
get
together
then
they
broke
up
their
camp
and
commenced
to
march
the
headman
guiding
them
through
the
snow
unfettered
when
they
had
reached
the
third
stage
cheirisophus
flew
into
a
rage
with
him
because
he
had
not
brought
them
to
any
villages
the
headman
pleaded
that
there
were
none
in
this
part
cheirisophus
struck
him
but
forgot
to
bind
him
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
the
headman
ran
away
in
the
night
and
was
gone
leaving
his
son
behind
him
this
was
the
sole
ground
of
difference
between
cheirisophus
and
xenophon
during
the
march
this
combination
of
and
neglect
in
the
case
of
the
guide
as
to
the
boy
episthenes
conceived
a
passion
for
him
and
took
him
home
with
him
and
found
in
him
the
most
faithful
of
friends
after
this
they
marched
seven
stages
at
the
rate
of
five
parasangs
a
day
to
the
banks
of
the
river
phasis
which
is
a
hundred
feet
broad
and
thence
they
marched
another
couple
of
stages
ten
parasangs
but
at
the
pass
leading
down
into
the
plain
there
appeared
in
front
of
them
a
mixed
body
of
chalybes
and
taochians
and
phasianians
when
cheirisophus
caught
sight
of
the
enemy
on
the
pass
at
a
distance
of
about
three
or
four
miles
he
ceased
marching
not
caring
to
approach
the
enemy
with
his
troops
in
column
and
he
passed
down
the
order
to
the
others
to
deploy
their
companies
to
the
front
that
the
troops
might
form
into
line
as
soon
as
the
rearguard
had
come
up
he
assembled
the
generals
and
officers
and
addressed
them
the
enemy
as
you
see
are
in
occupation
of
the
mountain
pass
it
is
time
we
should
consider
how
we
are
to
make
the
best
fight
to
win
it
my
opinion
is
that
we
should
give
orders
to
the
troops
to
take
their
morning
meal
whilst
we
deliberate
whether
we
should
cross
the
mountains
or
my
opinion
said
cleanor
is
that
as
soon
as
we
have
breakfasted
we
should
arm
for
the
fight
and
attack
the
enemy
without
loss
of
time
for
if
we
fritter
away
the
enemy
who
are
now
content
to
look
at
us
will
grow
bolder
and
with
their
growing
courage
depend
upon
it
others
more
numerous
will
join
them
probably
a
tributary
of
the
araxes
modern
after
him
xenophon
spoke
this
he
said
is
how
i
see
the
matter
if
fight
we
must
let
us
make
preparation
to
sell
our
lives
dearly
but
if
we
desire
to
cross
with
the
greatest
ease
the
point
to
consider
is
how
we
may
get
the
fewest
wounds
and
throw
away
the
smallest
number
of
good
men
well
then
that
part
of
the
mountain
which
is
visible
stretches
nearly
seven
miles
where
are
the
men
posted
to
intercept
us
except
at
the
road
itself
they
are
nowhere
to
be
seen
it
is
much
better
to
try
if
possible
to
steal
a
point
of
this
desert
mountain
unobserved
and
before
they
know
where
we
are
secure
the
prize
than
to
fly
at
a
strong
position
and
an
enemy
thoroughly
prepared
since
it
is
much
easier
to
march
up
a
mountain
without
fighting
than
to
tramp
along
a
level
when
assailants
are
at
either
hand
and
provided
he
has
not
to
fight
a
man
will
see
what
lies
at
his
feet
much
more
plainly
even
at
night
than
in
broad
daylight
in
the
midst
of
battle
and
a
rough
road
to
feet
that
roam
in
peace
may
be
pleasanter
than
a
smooth
surface
with
the
bullets
whistling
about
your
ears
nor
is
it
so
impossible
i
take
it
to
steal
a
march
since
it
is
open
to
us
to
go
by
night
when
we
can
not
be
seen
and
to
fall
back
so
far
that
they
will
never
notice
us
in
my
opinion
however
if
we
make
a
feint
of
attacking
here
we
shall
find
the
mountain
chain
all
the
more
deserted
elsewhere
since
the
enemy
will
be
waiting
for
us
here
in
thicker
swarm
or
more
with
the
head
a
mark
for
missiles
but
what
right
have
i
to
be
drawing
conclusions
about
stealing
in
your
presence
cheirisophus
for
you
lacedaemonians
as
i
have
often
been
told
you
who
belong
to
the
practise
stealing
from
your
boyhood
up
and
it
is
no
disgrace
but
honourable
rather
to
steal
except
such
things
as
the
law
forbids
and
in
order
i
presume
to
stimulate
your
sense
of
secretiveness
and
to
make
you
master
thieves
it
is
lawful
for
you
further
to
get
a
whipping
if
you
are
caught
now
then
you
have
a
fine
opportunity
of
displaying
your
training
but
take
care
we
are
not
caught
stealing
over
the
mountain
or
we
shall
catch
it
ourselves
for
all
that
retorted
cheirisophus
i
have
heard
that
you
athenians
are
clever
hands
at
stealing
the
public
moneys
and
that
too
though
there
is
a
fearful
risk
for
the
person
so
employed
but
i
am
told
it
is
your
best
men
who
are
addicted
to
it
if
it
is
your
best
men
who
are
thought
worthy
to
rule
so
it
is
a
fine
opportunity
for
yourself
also
xenophon
to
exhibit
your
education
and
i
replied
xenophon
am
ready
to
take
the
rear
division
as
soon
as
we
have
supped
and
seize
the
mountain
chain
i
have
already
got
guides
for
the
light
troops
laid
an
ambuscade
and
seized
some
of
the
vagabonds
who
hung
on
our
rear
i
am
further
informed
by
them
that
the
mountain
is
not
inaccessible
but
is
grazed
by
goats
and
cattle
so
that
if
we
can
once
get
hold
of
any
portion
of
it
there
will
be
no
difficulty
as
regards
our
animals
they
can
cross
as
to
the
enemy
i
expect
they
will
not
even
wait
for
us
any
longer
when
they
once
see
us
on
a
level
with
themselves
on
the
heights
for
they
do
not
even
at
present
care
to
come
down
and
meet
us
on
fair
ground
cheirisophus
answered
but
why
should
you
go
and
leave
your
command
in
the
rear
send
others
rather
unless
a
band
of
volunteers
will
present
themselves
thereupon
aristonymus
the
methydrian
came
forward
with
some
heavy
infantry
and
nicomachus
the
oetean
with
another
body
of
light
troops
and
they
made
an
agreement
to
kindle
several
as
soon
as
they
held
the
heights
the
arrangements
made
they
breakfasted
and
after
breakfast
cheirisophus
advanced
the
whole
army
ten
furlongs
closer
towards
the
enemy
so
as
to
strengthen
the
impression
that
he
intended
to
attack
them
at
that
point
but
as
soon
as
they
had
supped
and
night
had
fallen
the
party
under
orders
set
off
and
occupied
the
mountain
while
the
main
body
rested
where
they
were
now
as
soon
as
the
enemy
perceived
that
the
mountain
was
taken
they
banished
all
thought
of
sleep
and
kept
many
blazing
throughout
the
night
but
at
break
of
day
cheirisophus
offered
sacrifice
and
began
advancing
along
the
road
while
the
detachment
which
held
the
mountain
advanced
pari
passu
by
the
high
ground
the
larger
mass
of
the
enemy
on
his
side
remained
still
on
the
but
a
section
of
them
turned
to
confront
the
detachment
on
the
heights
before
the
main
bodies
had
time
to
draw
together
the
detachment
on
the
height
came
to
close
quarters
and
the
hellenes
were
victorious
and
gave
chase
meanwhile
the
light
division
of
the
hellenes
issuing
from
the
plain
were
rapidly
advancing
against
the
serried
lines
of
the
enemy
whilst
cheirisophus
followed
up
with
his
heavy
infantry
at
quick
march
but
the
enemy
on
the
road
no
sooner
saw
their
higher
division
being
worsted
than
they
fled
and
some
few
of
them
were
slain
and
a
vast
number
of
wicker
shields
were
taken
which
the
hellenes
hacked
to
pieces
with
their
short
swords
and
rendered
useless
so
when
they
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
pass
they
sacrificed
and
set
up
a
trophy
and
descending
into
the
plain
reached
villages
abounding
in
good
things
of
every
kind
vii
after
this
they
marched
into
the
country
of
the
taochians
five
stages
thirty
parasangs
and
provisions
failed
for
the
taochians
lived
in
strong
places
into
which
they
had
carried
up
all
their
stores
now
when
the
army
arrived
before
one
of
these
strong
places
a
mere
fortress
without
city
or
houses
into
which
a
motley
crowd
of
men
and
women
and
numerous
flocks
and
herds
were
gathered
cheirisophus
attacked
at
once
when
the
first
regiment
fell
back
tired
a
second
advanced
and
again
a
third
for
it
was
impossible
to
surround
the
place
in
full
force
as
it
was
encircled
by
a
river
presently
xenophon
came
up
with
the
rearguard
consisting
of
both
light
and
heavy
infantry
whereupon
cheirisophus
halted
him
with
the
words
in
the
nick
of
time
you
have
come
we
must
take
this
place
for
the
troops
have
no
provisions
unless
we
take
it
thereupon
they
consulted
together
and
to
xenophon
inquiry
what
it
was
which
hindered
their
simply
walking
in
cheirisophus
replied
there
is
just
this
one
narrow
approach
which
you
see
but
when
we
attempt
to
pass
it
by
they
roll
down
volleys
of
stones
from
yonder
overhanging
crag
pointing
up
and
this
is
the
state
in
which
you
find
yourself
if
you
chance
to
be
caught
and
he
pointed
to
some
poor
fellows
with
their
legs
or
ribs
crushed
to
bits
but
when
they
have
expended
their
ammunition
said
xenophon
there
is
nothing
else
is
there
to
hinder
our
passing
certainly
except
yonder
handful
of
fellows
there
is
no
one
in
front
of
us
that
we
can
see
and
of
them
only
two
or
three
apparently
are
armed
and
the
distance
to
be
traversed
under
fire
is
as
your
eyes
will
tell
you
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
as
near
as
can
be
and
of
this
space
the
first
hundred
is
thickly
covered
with
great
pines
at
intervals
under
cover
of
these
what
harm
can
come
to
our
men
from
a
pelt
of
stones
flying
or
rolling
so
then
there
is
only
fifty
feet
left
to
cross
during
a
lull
of
stones
ay
said
cheirisophus
but
with
our
first
attempt
to
approach
the
bush
a
galling
fire
of
stones
commences
the
very
thing
we
want
said
the
other
for
they
will
use
up
their
ammunition
all
the
quicker
but
let
us
select
a
point
from
which
we
shall
have
only
a
brief
space
to
run
across
if
we
can
and
from
which
it
will
be
easier
to
get
back
if
we
wish
thereupon
cheirisophus
and
xenophon
set
out
with
callimachus
the
parrhasian
the
captain
in
command
of
the
officers
of
the
rearguard
that
day
the
rest
of
the
captains
remained
out
of
danger
that
done
the
next
step
was
for
a
party
of
about
seventy
men
to
get
away
under
the
trees
not
in
a
body
but
one
by
one
every
one
using
his
best
precaution
and
agasis
the
stymphalian
and
aristonymous
the
methydrian
who
were
also
officers
of
the
rearguard
were
posted
as
supports
outside
the
trees
for
it
was
not
possible
for
more
than
a
single
company
to
stand
safely
within
the
trees
here
callimachus
hit
upon
a
pretty
contrivance
he
ran
forward
from
the
tree
under
which
he
was
posted
two
or
three
paces
and
as
soon
as
the
stones
came
whizzing
he
retired
easily
but
at
each
excursion
more
than
ten
of
rocks
were
expended
agasias
seeing
how
callimachus
was
amusing
himself
and
the
whole
army
looking
on
as
spectators
was
seized
with
the
fear
that
he
might
miss
his
chance
of
being
first
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
enemy
fire
and
get
into
the
place
so
without
a
word
of
summons
to
his
neighbour
aristonymous
or
to
eurylochus
of
lusia
both
comrades
of
his
or
to
any
one
else
off
he
set
on
his
own
account
and
passed
the
whole
detachment
but
callimachus
seeing
him
tearing
past
caught
hold
of
his
shield
by
the
rim
and
in
the
meantime
aristonymous
the
methydrian
ran
past
both
and
after
him
eurylochus
of
lusia
for
they
were
one
and
all
aspirants
to
valour
and
in
that
high
pursuit
each
was
the
eager
rival
of
the
rest
so
in
this
strife
of
honour
the
three
of
them
took
the
fortress
and
when
they
had
once
rushed
in
not
a
stone
more
was
hurled
from
overhead
and
here
a
terrible
spectacle
displayed
itself
the
women
first
cast
their
infants
down
the
cliff
and
then
they
cast
themselves
after
their
fallen
little
ones
and
the
men
likewise
in
such
a
scene
aeneas
the
stymphalian
an
officer
caught
sight
of
a
man
with
a
fine
dress
about
to
throw
himself
over
and
seized
hold
of
him
to
stop
him
but
the
other
caught
him
to
his
arms
and
both
were
gone
in
an
instant
headlong
down
the
crags
and
were
killed
out
of
this
place
the
merest
handful
of
human
beings
were
taken
prisoners
but
cattle
and
asses
in
abundance
and
flocks
of
sheep
from
this
place
they
marched
through
the
chalybes
seven
stages
fifty
parasangs
these
were
the
bravest
men
whom
they
encountered
on
the
whole
march
coming
cheerily
to
close
quarters
with
them
they
wore
linen
cuirasses
reaching
to
the
groin
and
instead
of
the
ordinary
wings
or
basques
a
fringe
of
cords
they
were
also
provided
with
greaves
and
helmets
and
at
the
girdle
a
short
sabre
about
as
long
as
the
laconian
dagger
with
which
they
cut
the
throats
of
those
they
mastered
and
after
severing
the
head
from
the
trunk
they
would
march
along
carrying
it
singing
and
dancing
when
they
drew
within
their
enemy
field
of
view
they
carried
also
a
spear
fifteen
cubits
long
lanced
at
one
end
this
folk
stayed
in
regular
townships
and
whenever
the
hellenes
passed
by
they
invariably
hung
close
on
their
heels
fighting
they
had
in
their
fortresses
and
into
them
they
had
carried
up
their
supplies
sot
hat
the
hellenes
could
get
nothing
from
this
district
but
supported
themselves
on
the
flocks
and
herds
they
had
taken
from
the
taochians
after
this
the
hellenes
reached
the
river
harpasus
which
was
four
hundred
feet
broad
hence
they
marched
through
the
scythenians
four
stages
twenty
parasangs
through
a
long
level
country
to
more
villages
among
which
they
halted
three
days
and
got
in
supplies
these
are
the
so
called
by
pliny
in
contradistinction
to
another
mountain
tribe
in
pontus
so
named
who
were
famous
for
their
forging
and
from
whom
steel
received
its
greek
name
khalups
with
these
latter
we
shall
make
acquaintance
later
on
with
a
single
point
or
spike
only
the
hellenic
spear
having
a
spike
at
the
butt
end
also
passing
on
from
thence
in
four
stages
of
twenty
parasangs
they
reached
a
large
and
prosperous
city
which
went
by
the
name
of
gymnias
from
which
the
governor
of
the
country
sent
them
a
guide
to
lead
them
through
a
district
hostile
to
his
own
this
guide
told
them
that
within
five
days
he
would
lead
them
to
a
place
from
which
they
would
see
the
sea
and
he
added
if
i
fail
of
my
word
you
are
free
to
take
my
life
accordingly
he
put
himself
at
their
head
but
he
no
sooner
set
foot
in
the
country
hostile
to
himself
than
he
fell
to
encouraging
them
to
burn
and
harry
the
land
indeed
his
exhortations
were
so
earnest
it
was
plain
that
it
was
for
this
he
had
come
and
not
out
of
the
he
bore
the
hellenes
gymnias
is
supposed
by
grote
hist
of
greece
vol
ix
to
be
the
same
as
that
which
is
now
called
perhaps
at
no
great
distance
from
baibut
tozer
turkish
armenia
others
have
identified
it
with
erzeroum
others
with
ispir
on
the
fifth
day
they
reached
the
mountain
the
name
of
which
was
theches
no
sooner
had
the
men
in
front
ascended
it
and
caught
sight
of
the
sea
than
a
great
cry
arose
and
xenophon
in
the
rearguard
catching
the
sound
of
it
conjectured
that
another
set
of
enemies
must
surely
be
attacking
in
front
for
they
were
followed
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
which
was
all
aflame
indeed
the
rearguard
had
killed
some
and
captured
others
alive
by
laying
an
ambuscade
they
had
taken
also
about
twenty
wicker
shields
covered
with
the
raw
hides
of
shaggy
oxen
some
mss
give
the
sacred
mountain
the
height
in
question
has
been
identified
with
the
ridge
called
to
the
east
of
nearer
to
the
sea
than
that
place
grote
ib
but
the
exact
place
from
which
they
caught
sight
of
the
sea
has
not
been
identified
as
yet
and
other
mountain
ranges
have
been
suggested
but
as
the
shout
became
louder
and
nearer
and
those
who
from
time
to
time
came
up
began
racing
at
the
top
of
their
speed
towards
the
shouters
and
the
shouting
continually
recommenced
with
yet
greater
volume
as
the
numbers
increased
xenophon
settled
in
his
mind
that
something
extraordinary
must
have
happened
so
he
mounted
his
horse
and
taking
with
him
lycius
and
the
cavalry
he
galloped
to
the
rescue
presently
they
could
hear
the
soldiers
shouting
and
passing
on
the
joyful
word
the
sea
the
sea
thereupon
they
began
running
rearguard
and
all
and
the
baggage
animals
and
horses
came
galloping
up
but
when
they
had
reached
the
summit
then
indeed
they
fell
to
embracing
one
another
generals
and
officers
and
all
and
the
tears
trickled
down
their
cheeks
and
on
a
sudden
some
one
whoever
it
was
having
passed
down
the
order
the
soldiers
began
bringing
stones
and
erecting
a
great
cairn
whereon
they
dedicated
a
host
of
untanned
skins
and
staves
and
captured
wicker
shields
and
with
his
own
hand
the
guide
hacked
the
shields
to
pieces
inviting
the
rest
to
follow
his
example
after
this
the
hellenes
dismissed
the
guide
with
a
present
raised
from
the
common
store
to
wit
a
horse
a
silver
bowl
a
persian
dress
and
ten
darics
but
what
he
most
begged
to
have
were
their
rings
and
of
these
he
got
several
from
the
soldiers
so
after
pointing
out
to
them
a
village
where
they
would
find
quarters
and
the
road
by
which
they
would
proceed
towards
the
land
of
the
macrones
as
evening
fell
he
turned
his
back
upon
them
in
the
night
and
was
gone
viii
from
this
point
the
hellenes
marched
through
the
country
of
the
macrones
three
stages
ten
parasangs
and
on
the
first
day
they
reached
the
river
which
formed
the
boundary
between
the
land
of
the
macrones
and
the
land
of
the
scythenians
above
them
on
their
right
they
had
a
country
of
the
sternest
and
ruggedest
character
and
on
their
left
another
river
into
which
the
frontier
river
discharges
itself
and
which
they
must
cross
this
was
thickly
fringed
with
trees
which
though
not
of
any
great
bulk
were
closely
packed
as
soon
as
they
came
up
to
them
the
hellenes
proceeded
to
cut
them
down
in
their
haste
to
get
out
of
the
place
as
soon
as
possible
but
the
macrones
armed
with
wicker
shields
and
lances
and
hair
tunics
were
already
drawn
up
to
receive
them
opposite
the
crossing
they
were
cheering
one
another
on
and
kept
up
a
steady
pelt
of
stones
into
the
river
though
they
failed
to
reach
the
other
side
or
do
any
harm
at
this
juncture
one
of
the
light
infantry
came
up
to
xenophon
he
had
been
he
said
a
slave
at
athens
and
he
wished
to
tell
him
that
he
recognised
the
speech
of
these
people
i
think
said
he
that
this
must
be
my
native
country
and
if
there
is
no
objection
i
will
have
a
talk
with
them
no
objection
at
all
replied
xenophon
pray
talk
to
them
and
ask
them
first
who
they
are
in
answer
to
this
question
they
said
they
were
macrones
well
then
said
he
ask
them
why
they
are
drawn
up
in
battle
and
want
to
fight
with
us
they
answered
because
you
are
invading
our
country
the
generals
bade
him
say
if
so
it
is
with
not
intention
certainly
of
doing
it
or
you
any
harm
but
we
have
been
at
war
with
the
king
and
are
now
returning
to
hellas
and
all
we
want
is
to
reach
the
sea
the
others
asked
were
they
willing
to
give
them
pledges
to
that
effect
they
replied
yes
they
were
ready
to
give
and
receive
pledges
to
that
effect
then
the
macrones
gave
a
barbaric
lance
to
the
hellenes
and
the
hellenes
a
hellenic
lance
to
them
for
these
they
said
would
serve
as
pledges
and
both
sides
called
upon
the
gods
to
witness
after
the
pledges
were
exchanged
the
macrones
fell
to
vigorously
hewing
down
trees
and
constructing
a
road
to
help
them
across
mingling
freely
with
the
hellenes
and
fraternising
in
their
midst
and
they
afforded
them
as
good
as
market
as
they
could
and
for
three
days
conducted
them
on
their
march
until
they
had
brought
them
safely
to
the
confines
of
the
colchians
at
this
point
they
were
confronted
by
a
great
mountain
chain
which
however
was
accessible
and
on
it
the
colchians
were
drawn
up
for
battle
in
the
first
instance
the
hellenes
drew
up
opposite
in
line
of
battle
as
though
they
were
minded
to
assault
the
hill
in
that
order
but
afterwards
the
generals
determined
to
hold
a
council
of
war
and
consider
how
to
make
the
fairest
fight
accordingly
xenophon
said
i
am
not
for
advancing
in
line
but
advise
to
form
companies
by
columns
to
begin
with
the
line
he
urged
would
be
scattered
and
thrown
into
disorder
at
once
for
we
shall
find
the
mountain
full
of
inequalities
it
will
be
pathless
here
and
easy
to
traverse
there
the
mere
fact
of
first
having
formed
in
line
and
then
seeing
the
line
thrown
into
disorder
must
exercise
a
disheartening
effect
again
if
we
advance
several
deep
the
enemy
will
none
the
less
overlap
us
and
turn
their
superfluous
numbers
to
account
as
best
they
like
while
if
we
march
in
shallow
order
we
may
fully
expect
our
line
to
be
cut
through
and
through
by
the
thick
rain
of
missiles
and
rush
of
men
and
if
this
happen
anywhere
along
the
line
the
whole
line
will
equally
suffer
no
my
notion
is
to
form
columns
by
companies
covering
ground
sufficient
with
spaces
between
the
companies
to
allow
the
last
companies
of
each
flank
to
be
outside
the
enemy
flanks
thus
we
shall
with
our
extreme
companies
be
outside
the
enemy
line
and
the
best
men
at
the
head
of
their
columns
will
lead
the
attack
and
every
company
will
pick
its
way
where
the
ground
is
easy
also
it
will
be
difficult
for
the
enemy
to
force
his
way
into
the
intervening
spaces
when
there
are
companies
on
both
sides
nor
will
it
be
easy
for
him
to
cut
in
twain
any
individual
company
marching
in
column
if
too
any
particular
company
should
be
pressed
the
neighbouring
company
will
come
to
the
rescue
or
if
at
any
point
any
single
company
succeed
in
reaching
the
height
from
that
moment
not
one
man
of
the
enemy
will
stand
his
ground
this
proposal
was
carried
and
they
formed
into
columns
by
companies
then
xenophon
returning
from
the
right
wing
to
the
left
addressed
the
soldiers
men
he
said
these
men
whom
you
see
in
front
of
you
are
the
sole
obstacles
still
interposed
between
us
and
the
haven
of
our
hopes
so
long
deferred
we
will
swallow
them
up
whole
without
cooking
if
we
can
for
this
formation
see
the
retreat
of
the
ten
thousand
a
military
study
for
all
time
by
vaughan
or
we
will
gobble
them
up
raw
he

of
the

perchance
wert
thou
to
enter
within
the
gates
and
long
walls
and
devour

and

and
all
the
trojans
then
mightest
thou
assuage
thine
leaf
the
several
divisions
fell
into
position
the
companies
were
formed
into
columns
and
the
result
was
a
total
of
something
like
eighty
companies
of
heavy
infantry
each
company
consisting
on
an
average
of
a
hundred
men
the
light
infantry
and
bowmen
were
arranged
in
three
divisions
two
outside
to
support
the
left
and
the
right
respectively
and
the
third
in
the
centre
each
division
consisting
of
about
six
hundred
men
this
suggests
as
the
total
of
the
peltasts
as
the
total
of
the
hoplites
but
the
companies
were
probably
not
limited
to
and
under
peltasts
were
probably
included
other
light
troops
before
starting
the
generals
passed
the
order
to
offer
prayer
and
with
the
prayer
and
battle
hymn
rising
from
their
lips
they
commenced
their
advance
cheirisophus
and
xenophon
and
the
light
infantry
with
them
advanced
outside
the
enemy
line
to
right
and
left
and
the
enemy
seeing
their
advance
made
an
effort
to
keep
parallel
and
confront
them
but
in
order
to
do
so
as
he
extended
partly
to
right
and
partly
to
left
he
was
pulled
to
pieces
and
there
was
a
large
space
or
hollow
left
in
the
centre
of
his
line
seeing
them
separate
thus
the
light
infantry
attached
to
the
arcadian
battalion
under
command
of
aeschines
an
arcarnanian
mistook
the
movement
for
flight
and
with
a
loud
shout
rushed
on
and
these
were
the
first
to
scale
the
mountain
summit
but
they
were
closely
followed
up
by
the
arcadian
heavy
infantry
under
command
of
cleanor
of
orchomenus
when
they
began
running
in
that
way
the
enemy
stood
their
ground
no
longer
but
betook
themselves
to
flight
one
in
one
direction
one
in
another
and
the
hellenes
scaled
the
hill
and
found
quarters
in
numerous
villages
which
contained
supplies
in
abundance
here
generally
speaking
there
was
nothing
to
excite
their
wonderment
but
the
numbers
of
were
indeed
astonishing
and
so
were
certain
properties
of
the
honey
the
effect
upon
the
soldiers
who
tasted
the
combs
was
that
they
all
went
for
the
nonce
quite
off
their
heads
and
suffered
from
vomiting
and
diarrhoea
with
a
total
inability
to
stand
steady
on
their
legs
a
small
dose
produced
a
condition
not
unlike
violent
drunkenness
a
large
one
an
attack
very
like
a
fit
of
madness
and
some
dropped
down
apparently
at
death
door
so
they
lay
hundreds
of
them
as
if
there
had
been
a
great
defeat
a
prey
to
the
cruellest
despondency
but
the
next
day
none
had
died
and
almost
at
the
same
hour
of
the
day
at
which
they
had
eaten
they
recovered
their
senses
and
on
the
third
or
fourth
day
got
on
their
legs
again
like
convalescents
after
a
severe
course
of
medical
treatment
modern
travellers

the
existence
in
these
regions

intoxicating

as
the
sacrifices
were
over
they
handed
over
the
hides
of
the
beasts
to
dracontius
and
bade
him
lead
the
way
to
his
racecourse
he
merely
waved
his
hand
and
pointed
to
where
they
were
standing
and
said
there
this
ridge
is
just
the
place
for
running
anywhere
everywhere
but
how
it
was
asked
will
they
manage
to
wrestle
on
the
hard
scrubby
ground
oh
worse
knocks
for
those
who
are
thrown
the
president
replied
there
was
a
mile
race
for
boys
the
majority
being
captive
lads
and
for
the
long
race
more
than
sixty
cretans
competed
there
was
wrestling
boxing
and
the
pankration
altogether
it
was
a
beautiful
spectacle
there
was
a
large
number
of
entries
and
the
emulation
with
their
companions
male
and
female
standing
as
spectators
was
immense
there
was
also
the
riders
had
to
gallop
down
a
steep
incline
to
the
sea
and
then
turn
and
come
up
again
to
the
altar
and
on
the
descent
more
than
half
rolled
head
over
heels
and
then
back
they
came
toiling
up
the
tremendous
steep
scarcely
out
of
a
walking
pace
loud
were
the
shouts
the
laughter
and
the
cheers
the
pankration
combined
both
wrestling
and
boxing
book
v
in
the
preceding
portion
of
the
narrative
a
detailed
account
is
given
of
all
that
the
hellenes
did
and
how
they
fared
on
the
march
up
with
cyrus
and
also
of
all
that
befell
them
on
their
march
subsequently
until
they
reached
the
seaboard
of
the
euxine
sea
or
pontus
and
the
hellenic
city
of
trapezus
where
they
duly
offered
the
sacrifice
for
safe
deliverance
which
they
had
vowed
to
offer
as
soon
as
they
set
foot
on
a
friendly
soil
i
after
this
they
met
and
took
counsel
concerning
the
remainder
of
the
march
the
first
speaker
was
antileon
of
thurii
he
rose
and
said
for
my
part
sirs
i
am
weary
by
this
time
of
getting
kit
together
and
packing
up
for
a
start
of
walking
and
running
and
carrying
heavy
arms
and
of
tramping
along
in
line
or
mounting
guard
and
doing
battle
the
sole
desire
i
now
have
is
to
cease
from
all
these
pains
and
for
the
future
since
here
we
have
the
sea
before
us
to
sail
on
and
on
out
in
sleep
like
odysseus
and
so
to
find
myself
in
hellas
when
they
heard
these
remarks
the
soldiers
showed
their
approval
with
loud
cries
of
well
said
and
then
another
spoke
to
the
same
effect
and
then
another
and
indeed
all
present
then
cheirisophus
got
up
and
said
i
have
a
friend
sirs
who
as
good
hap
will
have
it
is
now
high
admiral
anaxibius
if
you
like
to
send
me
to
him
i
think
i
can
safely
promise
to
return
with
some
and
other
vessels
which
will
carry
us
all
you
have
to
do
if
you
are
really
minded
to
go
home
by
sea
is
to
wait
here
till
i
come
i
will
be
back
ere
long
the
soldiers
were
delighted
at
these
words
and
voted
that
cheirisophus
should
set
sail
on
his
mission
without
delay
after
him
xenophon
got
up
and
spoke
as
follows
cheirisophus
it
is
agreed
sets
out
in
search
of
vessels
and
we
are
going
to
await
him
let
me
tell
you
what
in
my
opinion
it
is
reasonable
to
do
while
we
are
waiting
first
of
all
we
must
provide
ourselves
with
necessaries
from
hostile
territory
for
there
is
not
a
sufficient
market
nor
if
there
were
have
we
with
a
few
solitary
exceptions
the
means
of
purchase
now
the
district
is
hostile
so
that
if
you
set
off
in
search
of
provisions
without
care
and
precaution
the
chances
are
that
many
of
us
will
be
lost
to
meet
this
risk
i
propose
that
we
should
organise
foraging
parties
to
capture
provisions
and
for
the
rest
not
roam
about
the
country
at
random
the
organisation
of
the
matter
should
be
left
to
us
the
resolution
was
passed
please
listen
to
another
proposal
he
continued
some
of
you
no
doubt
will
be
going
out
to
pillage
it
will
be
best
i
think
that
whoever
does
so
should
in
each
case
before
starting
inform
us
of
his
intent
and
in
what
direction
he
means
to
go
so
that
we
may
know
the
exact
number
of
those
who
are
out
and
of
those
who
stop
behind
thus
we
shall
be
able
to
help
in
preparing
and
starting
the
expedition
where
necessary
and
in
case
of
aid
or
reinforcements
being
called
for
we
shall
know
in
what
direction
to
proceed
or
again
if
the
attempt
is
to
be
undertaken
by
raw
or
less
expert
hands
we
may
throw
in
the
weight
of
our
experience
and
advice
by
endeavouring
to
discover
the
strength
of
those
whom
they
design
to
attack
this
proposal
was
also
carried
here
is
another
point
he
continued
to
which
i
would
draw
your
attention
our
enemies
will
not
lack
leisure
to
make
raids
upon
us
nor
is
it
unnatural
that
they
should
lay
plots
for
us
for
we
have
appropriated
what
is
theirs
they
are
seated
over
us
ever
on
the
watch
i
propose
then
that
we
should
have
regular
outposts
round
the
camp
if
we
take
it
in
succession
to
do
picket
and
outlook
duty
the
enemy
will
be
less
able
to
harry
us
and
here
is
another
point
for
your
observation
supposing
we
knew
for
certain
that
cheirisophus
must
return
with
a
sufficient
number
of
vessels
there
would
be
no
need
of
the
remark
but
as
that
is
still
problematical
i
propose
that
we
should
try
to
get
together
vessels
on
the
spot
also
if
he
comes
and
finds
us
already
provided
for
here
we
shall
have
more
ships
than
we
need
that
is
all
while
if
he
fails
to
bring
them
we
shall
have
the
local
supply
to
fall
back
upon
i
see
ships
sailing
past
perpetually
so
we
have
only
to
ask
the
loan
of
some
from
the
men
of
trapezus
and
we
can
bring
them
into
port
and
safeguard
them
with
their
rudders
unshipped
until
we
have
enough
to
carry
us
by
this
course
i
think
we
shall
not
fail
of
finding
the
means
of
transport
requisite
that
resolution
was
also
passed
he
proceeded
consider
whether
you
think
it
equitable
to
support
by
means
of
a
general
fund
the
ships
companies
which
we
so
impress
while
they
wait
here
for
our
benefit
and
to
agree
upon
a
fare
on
the
principle
of
repaying
kindnesses
in
kind
that
too
was
passed
well
then
said
he
in
case
after
all
our
endeavours
should
not
be
crowned
with
success
and
we
find
that
we
have
not
vessels
enough
i
propose
that
we
should
enjoin
on
the
cities
along
the
seaboard
the
duty
of
constructing
and
putting
in
order
the
roads
which
we
hear
are
impassable
they
will
be
only
too
glad
to
obey
no
doubt
out
of
mere
terror
and
their
desire
to
be
rid
of
us
this
last
proposal
was
met
by
loud
cries
and
protestations
against
the
idea
of
going
by
land
at
all
so
perceiving
their
infatuation
he
did
not
put
the
question
to
the
vote
but
eventually
persuaded
the
cities
voluntarily
to
construct
roads
by
the
suggestion
if
you
get
your
roads
in
good
order
we
shall
all
the
sooner
be
gone
they
further
got
a
galley
from
the
trapezuntines
and
gave
the
command
of
it
to
dexippus
a
laconian
one
of
the
perioeci
this
man
altogether
neglected
to
collect
vessels
on
the
offing
but
slunk
off
himself
and
vanished
ship
and
all
out
of
pontus
later
on
however
he
paid
the
penalty
of
his
misdeeds
he
became
involved
in
some
meddling
and
making
in
thrace
at
the
court
of
seuthes
and
was
put
to
death
by
the
laconian
nicander
they
also
got
a
galley
the
command
of
which
was
entrusted
to
polycrates
an
athenian
and
that
officer
brought
into
harbour
to
the
camp
all
the
vessels
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
if
these
were
laden
they
took
out
the
freights
and
appointed
guards
to
keep
an
eye
on
their
preservation
whilst
they
used
the
ships
themselves
for
transport
service
on
the
coast
while
matters
stood
at
this
point
the
hellenes
used
to
make
forays
with
varying
success
sometimes
they
captured
prey
and
sometimes
they
failed
on
one
occasion
cleanetus
led
his
own
and
another
company
against
a
strong
position
and
was
killed
himself
with
many
others
of
his
party
a
native
of
the
country
parts
of
laconia
ii
the
time
came
when
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
capture
provisions
going
and
returning
to
the
camp
in
one
day
in
consequence
of
this
xenophon
took
some
guides
from
the
trapezuntines
and
led
half
the
army
out
against
the
drilae
leaving
the
other
half
to
guard
the
camp
that
was
necessary
since
the
colchians
who
had
been
ousted
from
their
houses
were
assembled
thickly
and
sat
eyeing
them
from
the
heights
above
on
the
other
hand
the
trapezuntines
being
friendly
to
the
native
inhabitants
were
not
for
leading
the
hellenes
to
places
where
it
was
easy
to
capture
provisions
but
against
the
drilae
from
whom
they
personally
suffered
they
would
lead
them
with
enthusiasm
up
into
mountainous
and
scarcely
accessible
fortresses
and
against
the
most
warlike
people
of
any
in
the
pontus
but
when
the
hellenes
had
reached
the
uplands
the
drilae
set
fire
to
all
their
fastnesses
which
they
thought
could
be
taken
easily
and
beat
a
retreat
and
except
here
and
there
a
stray
pig
or
bullock
or
other
animal
which
had
escaped
the
fire
there
was
nothing
to
capture
but
there
was
one
fastness
which
served
as
their
metropolis
into
this
the
different
streams
of
people
collected
round
it
ran
a
tremendously
deep
ravine
and
the
approaches
to
the
place
were
difficult
so
the
light
infantry
ran
forward
five
or
six
furlongs
in
advance
of
the
heavy
infantry
and
crossed
the
ravine
and
seeing
quantities
of
sheep
and
other
things
proceeded
to
attack
the
place
close
at
their
heels
followed
a
number
of
those
who
had
set
out
on
the
foray
armed
with
spears
so
that
the
storming
party
across
the
ravine
amounted
to
more
than
two
thousand
but
finding
that
they
could
not
take
the
place
by
a
as
there
was
a
trench
running
round
it
mounded
up
some
breadth
with
a
stockade
on
the
top
of
the
earthwork
and
a
row
of
wooden
bastions
they
made
an
attempt
to
run
back
but
the
enemy
fell
upon
them
from
the
rear
to
get
away
by
a
sudden
rush
was
out
of
the
question
since
the
descent
from
the
fortress
into
the
ravine
only
admitted
of
moving
in
single
file
under
the
circumstances
they
sent
to
xenophon
who
was
in
command
of
the
heavy
infantry
the
messenger
came
and
delivered
his
message
there
is
a
fastness
choke
full
of
all
sorts
of
stores
but
we
can
not
take
it
it
is
too
strong
nor
can
we
easily
get
away
the
enemy
rush
out
and
deliver
battle
and
the
return
is
difficult
on
hearing
this
xenophon
pushed
forward
his
heavy
infantry
to
the
edge
of
the
ravine
and
there
ordered
them
to
take
up
a
position
while
he
himself
with
the
officers
crossed
over
to
determine
whether
it
were
better
to
withdraw
the
party
already
across
or
to
bring
over
the
heavy
infantry
also
on
the
supposition
that
the
fortress
might
be
taken
in
favour
of
the
latter
opinion
it
was
agreed
that
the
retreat
must
cost
many
lives
and
the
officers
were
further
disposed
to
think
they
could
take
the
place
xenophon
consented
relying
on
the
victims
for
the
seers
had
announced
that
there
would
be
a
battle
but
that
the
result
of
the
expedition
would
be
good
so
he
sent
the
officers
to
bring
the
heavy
troops
across
while
he
himself
remained
having
drawn
off
all
the
light
infantry
and
forbidden
all
at
long
range
as
soon
as
the
heavy
infantry
had
arrived
he
ordered
each
captain
to
form
his
company
in
whatever
way
he
hoped
to
make
it
most
effective
in
the
coming
struggle
side
by
side
together
they
stood
these
captains
not
for
the
first
time
competitors
for
the
award
of
manly
virtue
while
they
were
thus
employed
he
the
general
was
engaged
in
passing
down
his
order
along
the
ranks
of
the
light
infantry
and
archers
respectively
to
march
with
the
javelin
on
its
thong
and
the
arrow
to
the
string
ready
at
the
word
shoot
to
discharge
their
missiles
while
the
light
troops
were
to
have
their
wallets
well
stocked
with
slingstones
lastly
he
despatched
his
adjutants
to
see
to
the
proper
carrying
out
of
these
orders
and
now
the
preparations
were
complete
the
officers
and
lieutenants
and
all
others
claiming
to
be
peers
of
these
were
drawn
up
in
their
several
places
with
a
glance
each
was
able
to
command
the
rest
in
the
disposition
which
the
ground
invited
presently
the
notes
of
the
battle
hymn
arose
the
clarion
spoke
and
with
a
thrilling
cry
in
honour
of
the
commenced
a
rush
of
the
heavy
infantry
at
full
speed
under
cover
of
a
storm
of
missiles
lances
arrows
bullets
but
most
of
all
stones
hurled
from
the
hand
with
ceaseless
pelt
while
there
were
some
who
brought
firebrands
to
bear
overwhelmed
by
this
crowd
of
missiles
the
enemy
left
their
stockades
and
their
bastion
towers
which
gave
agasias
the
stymphalian
and
philoxenus
of
pellene
a
chance
not
to
be
missed
laying
aside
their
heavy
arms
up
they
went
in
bare
tunics
only
and
one
hauled
another
up
and
meantime
another
had
mounted
and
the
place
was
taken
as
they
thought
then
the
peltasts
and
light
troops
rushed
in
and
began
snatching
what
each
man
could
xenophon
the
while
posted
at
the
gates
kept
back
as
many
of
the
hoplites
as
he
could
for
there
were
other
enemies
now
visible
on
certain
strong
citadel
heights
and
after
a
lapse
of
no
long
time
a
shout
arose
within
and
the
men
came
running
back
some
still
clutching
what
they
had
seized
and
presently
here
and
there
a
wounded
man
and
mighty
was
the
jostling
about
the
portals
to
the
questions
which
were
put
to
them
the
outpouring
fugitives
repeated
the
same
story
there
was
a
citadel
within
and
enemies
in
crowds
were
making
savage
sallies
and
beating
the
fellows
inside
at
that
xenophon
ordered
tolmides
the
herald
to
proclaim
enter
all
who
are
minded
to
capture
aught
in
poured
the
surging
multitude
and
the
of
persons
elbowing
their
passage
in
prevailed
over
the
stream
of
those
who
issued
forth
until
they
beat
back
and
cooped
up
the
enemy
within
the
citadel
again
so
outside
the
citadel
everything
was
sacked
and
pillaged
by
the
hellenes
and
the
heavy
infantry
took
up
their
position
some
about
the
stockades
others
along
the
road
leading
up
to
the
citadel
xenophon
and
the
officers
meantime
considered
the
possibility
of
taking
the
citadel
for
if
so
their
safety
was
assured
but
if
otherwise
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
get
away
as
the
result
of
their
deliberations
they
agreed
that
the
place
was
impregnable
then
they
began
making
preparations
for
the
retreat
each
set
of
men
proceeded
to
pull
down
the
palisading
which
faced
themselves
further
they
sent
away
all
who
were
useless
or
who
had
enough
to
do
to
carry
their
burdens
with
the
mass
of
the
heavy
infantry
accompanying
them
the
officers
in
each
case
leaving
behind
men
whom
they
could
severally
depend
on
but
as
soon
as
they
began
to
retreat
out
rushed
upon
them
from
within
a
host
of
fellows
armed
with
wicker
shields
and
lances
greaves
and
paphlagonian
helmets
others
might
be
seen
scaling
the
houses
on
this
side
and
that
of
the
road
leading
into
the
citadel
even
pursuit
in
the
direction
of
the
citadel
was
dangerous
since
the
enemy
kept
hurling
down
on
them
great
beams
from
above
so
that
to
stop
and
to
make
off
were
alike
dangerous
and
night
approaching
was
full
of
terrors
but
in
the
midst
of
their
fighting
and
their
despair
some
god
gave
them
a
means
of
safety
all
of
a
sudden
by
whatsoever
hand
ignited
a
flame
shot
up
it
came
from
a
house
on
the
right
hand
and
as
this
gradually
fell
in
the
people
from
the
other
houses
on
the
right
took
to
their
heels
and
fled
xenophon
laying
this
lesson
of
fortune
to
heart
gave
orders
to
set
fire
to
the
houses
also
which
being
of
wood
burned
quickly
with
the
result
that
the
occupants
of
these
also
took
to
flight
the
men
immediately
at
their
front
were
the
sole
annoyance
now
and
these
were
safe
to
fall
upon
them
as
they
made
their
exit
and
in
their
descent
here
then
the
word
was
passed
for
all
who
were
out
of
range
to
bring
up
logs
of
wood
and
pile
them
between
themselves
and
the
enemy
and
when
there
was
enough
of
these
they
set
them
on
fire
they
also
fired
the
houses
along
the
itself
so
as
to
occupy
the
attention
of
the
enemy
thus
they
got
off
though
with
difficulty
and
escaped
from
the
place
by
putting
a
fire
between
them
and
the
enemy
and
the
whole
city
was
burnt
down
houses
turrets
stockading
and
everything
belonging
to
it
except
the
citadel
next
day
the
hellenes
were
bent
on
getting
back
with
the
provisions
but
as
they
dreaded
the
descent
to
trapezus
which
was
precipitous
and
narrow
they
laid
a
false
ambuscade
and
a
mysian
called
after
the
name
of
his
nation
mysus
took
ten
of
the
cretans
and
halted
in
some
thick
brushy
ground
where
he
made
a
feint
of
endeavouring
to
escape
the
notice
of
the
enemy
the
glint
of
their
light
shields
which
were
of
brass
now
and
again
gleamed
through
the
brushwood
the
enemy
seeing
it
all
through
the
thicket
were
confirmed
in
their
fears
of
an
ambuscade
but
the
army
meanwhile
was
quietly
making
its
descent
and
when
it
appeared
that
they
had
crept
down
far
enough
the
signal
was
given
to
the
mysian
to
flee
as
fast
as
he
could
and
he
springing
up
fled
with
his
men
the
rest
of
the
party
that
is
the
cretans
saying
we
are
caught
if
we
race
left
the
road
and
plunged
into
a
wood
and
tumbling
and
rolling
down
the
gullies
were
saved
the
mysian
fleeing
along
the
road
kept
crying
for
assistance
which
they
sent
him
and
picked
him
up
wounded
the
party
of
rescue
now
beat
a
retreat
themselves
with
their
face
to
the
foe
exposed
to
a
shower
of
missiles
to
which
some
of
the
cretan
bowmen
responded
with
their
arrows
in
this
way
they
all
reached
the
camp
in
safety
lit
musos
mysus
a
mysian
by
birth
and

by
name

now
when
cheirisophus
did
not
arrive
and
the
supply
of
ships
was
insufficient
and
to
get
provisions
longer
was
impossible
they
resolved
to
depart
on

vessels
they
embarked

sick
and
those
above
forty
years
of
age

were
not

forced
to
take
for
their
own
use
the
two
eldest
generals
philesius
and
sophaenetus
were
put
in
charge
and
so
the
party
embarked
while
the
rest
resumed
their
march
for
the
road
was
now
completely
constructed
continuing
their
march
that
day
and
the
next
on

third
they
reached

hellenic
city
on
the
sea
and
a
colony
of
sinope
in
the
country
of
the
colchians
here
they
halted
ten
days
and
there
was
a
review

of
the
troops
under
arms
when
there
were
found
to
be
eight
thousand
six
hundred

many
had
escaped

perished
at

by

snow
or
else
disease
at

they
divided
the
money
accruing
from
the
captives
sold
and
a
tithe
selected
for
apollo
and

was
divided
between

continued
the

the

being
conveyed
by

as
before
and
the
rest
marching
by
land
when
they
had
reached
the
frontiers
of
the
mossynoecians
they
sent
to
him
timesitheus
the
trapezuntine
who
was
the
proxenos
of
the
mossynoecians
to
inquire
whether
they
were
to
pass
through
their
territory
as
friends
or
foes
they
trusting
in
their
strongholds
replied
that
they
would
not
give
them
passage
it
was
then
that
timesitheus
informed
them
that
the
mossynoecians
on
the
farther
side
of
the
country
were
hostile
to
these
members
of
the
tribe
and
it
was
resolved
to
invite
the
former
to
make
an
alliance
if
they
wished
it
so
timesitheus
was
sent
and
came
back
with
their
chiefs
on
their
arrival
there
was
a
conference
of
the
mossynoecian
chiefs
and
the
generals
of
the
hellenes
and
xenophon
made
a
speech
which
timesitheus
interpreted
he
said
men
of
the
mossynoecians
our
desire
is
to
reach
hellas
in
safety
and
since
we
have
no
vessels
we
must
needs
go
by
foot
but
these
people
who
as
we
hear
are
your
enemies
prevent
us
will
you
take
us
for
your
allies
now
is
your
chance
to
exact
vengeance
for
any
wrong
which
they
at
any
time
may
have
put
upon
you
and
for
the
future
they
will
be
your
subjects
but
if
you
send
us
about
our
business
consider
and
ask
yourselves
from
what
quarter
will
you
ever
again
obtain
so
strong
a
force
to
help
you
to
this
the
chief
of
the
mossynoecians
made
answer
that
the
proposal
was
in
accordance
with
their
wishes
and
they
welcomed
the
alliance
good
said
xenophon
but
to
what
use
do
you
propose
to
put
us
if
we
become
your
allies
and
what
will
you
in
turn
be
able
to
do
to
assist
our
passage
they
replied
we
can
make
an
incursion
into
this
country
hostile
to
yourselves
and
us
from
the
opposite
side
and
also
send
you
ships
and
men
to
this
place
who
will
aid
you
in
fighting
and
conduct
you
on
the
road

in
mossyns
or

towers

iii

cf
also
strabo
xi
or

on
this
understanding
they
exchanged
pledges
and
were
gone
the
next
day
they
returned
bringing
three
hundred
canoes
each
hollowed
out
of
a
single
trunk
there
were
three
men
in
each
two
of
whom
disembarked
and
fell
into
rank
whilst
the
third
remained
then
the
one
set
took
the
boats
and
sailed
back
again
whilst
the
other
who
remained
marshalled
themselves
in
the
following
way
they
stood
in
rows
of
about
a
hundred
each
like
the
rows
of
dancers
in
a
chorus
standing
to
one
another
and
all
bearing
wicker
shields
made
of
white
oxhide
shaggy
and
shaped
like
an
ivy
leaf
in
the
right
hand
they
brandished
a
javelin
about
six
cubits
long
with
a
lance
in
front
and
rounded
like
a
ball
at
the
butt
end
of
the
shaft
their
bodies
were
clad
in
short
frocks
scarcely
reaching
to
the
knees
and
in
texture
closely
resembling
that
of
a
linen
bedclothes
bag
on
their
heads
they
wore
leathern
helmets
just
like
the
paphlagonian
helmet
with
a
tuft
of
hair
in
the
middle
as
like
a
tiara
in
shape
as
possible
they
carried
moreover
iron
then
one
of
them
gave
as
it
were
the
and
started
while
the
rest
taking
up
the
strain
and
the
step
followed
singing
and
marking
time
passing
through
the
various
corps
and
heavy
armed
battalions
of
the
hellenes
they
marched
straight
against
the
enemy
to
what
appeared
the
most
assailable
of
his
fortresses
it
was
situated
in
front
of
the
city
or
mother
city
as
it
is
called
which
latter
contains
the
high
citadel
of
the
mossynoecians
this
citadel
was
the
real
bone
of
contention
the
occupants
at
any
time
being
acknowledged
as
the
masters
of
all
the
other
mossynoecians
the
present
holders
so
it
was
explained
had
no
right
to
its
possession
for
the
sake
of
they
had
seized
what
was
really
common
property
some
of
the
hellenes
followed
the
attacking
party
not
under
the
orders
of
the
generals
but
for
the
sake
of
plunder
as
they
advanced
the
enemy
for
a
while
kept
quiet
but
as
they
got
near
the
place
they
made
a
sortie
and
routed
them
killing
several
of
the
barbarians
as
well
as
some
of
the
hellenes
who
had
gone
up
with
them
and
so
pursued
them
until
they
saw
the
hellenes
advancing
to
the
rescue
then
they
turned
round
and
made
off
first
cutting
off
the
heads
of
the
dead
men
and
flaunting
them
in
the
face
of
the
hellenes
and
of
their
own
private
foes
dancing
the
while
and
singing
in
a
measured
strain
but
the
hellenes
were
much
vexed
to
think
that
their
foes
had
only
been
rendered
bolder
while
the
hellenes
who
had
formed
part
of
the
expedition
had
turned
tail
and
fled
in
spite
of
their
numbers
a
thing
which
had
not
happened
previously
during
the
whole
expedition
so
xenophon
called
a
meeting
of
the
hellenes
and
spoke
as
follows
soldiers
do
not
in
any
wise
be
cast
down
by
what
has
happened
be
sure
that
good
no
less
than
evil
will
be
the
result
for
to
begin
with
you
now
know
certainly
that
those
who
are
going
to
guide
us
are
in
very
deed
hostile
to
those
with
whom
necessity
drives
us
to
quarrel
and
in
the
next
place
some
of
our
own
body
these
hellenes
who
have
made
so
light
of
orderly
array
and
conjoint
action
with
ourselves
as
though
they
must
needs
achieve
in
the
company
of
barbarians
all
they
could
with
ourselves
have
paid
the
penalty
and
been
taught
a
lesson
so
that
another
time
they
will
be
less
prone
to
leave
our
ranks
but
you
must
be
prepared
to
show
these
friendly
barbarians
that
you
are
of
a
better
sort
and
prove
to
the
enemy
that
battle
with
the
undisciplined
is
one
thing
but
with
men
like
yourselves
another
accordingly
they
halted
as
they
were
that
day
next
day
they
sacrificed
and
finding
the
victims
favourable
they
breakfasted
formed
the
companies
into
columns
and
with
their
barbarians
arranged
in
similar
order
on
their
left
began
their
march
between
the
companies
were
the
archers
only
slightly
retired
behind
the
front
of
the
heavy
infantry
on
account
of
the
enemy
active
light
troops
who
ran
down
and
kept
up
volleys
of
stones
these
were
held
in
check
by
the
archers
and
peltasts
and
steadily
step
by
step
the
mass
marched
on
first
to
the
position
from
which
the
barbarians
and
those
with
them
had
been
driven
two
days
back
and
where
the
enemy
were
now
drawn
up
to
meet
them
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
barbarians
first
grappled
with
the
peltasts
and
maintained
the
battle
until
the
heavy
infantry
were
close
when
they
turned
and
fled
the
peltasts
followed
without
delay
and
pursued
them
right
up
to
their
city
while
the
heavy
troops
in
unbroken
order
followed
as
soon
as
they
were
up
at
the
houses
of
the
capital
there
and
then
the
enemy
collecting
all
together
in
one
strong
body
fought
valiantly
and
hurled
their
javelins
or
else
clenched
their
long
stout
spears
almost
too
heavy
for
a
man
to
wield
and
did
their
best
to
ward
off
the
attack
at
close
quarters
but
when
the
hellenes
instead
of
giving
way
kept
massing
together
more
thickly
the
barbarians
fled
from
this
place
also
and
in
a
body
deserted
the
fortress
their
king
who
sat
in
his
wooden
tower
or
mossyn
built
on
the
citadel
there
he
sits
and
there
they
maintain
him
all
at
the
common
cost
and
guard
him
narrowly
refused
to
come
forth
as
did
also
those
in
the
fortress
first
taken
and
so
were
burnt
to
a
cinder
where
they
were
their
mossyns
themselves
and
all
the
hellenes
pillaging
and
ransacking
these
places
discovered
in
the
different
houses
treasures
and
magazines
of
loaves
pile
upon
pile
the
ancestral
stores
as
the
mossynoecians
told
them
but
the
new
corn
was
laid
up
apart
with
the
and
ear
together
and
this
was
for
the
most
part
spelt
slices
of
dolphin
were
another
discovery
in
jars
all
properly
salted
and
pickled
and
there
was
blubber
of
dolphin
in
vessels
which
the
mossynoecians
used
precisely
as
the
hellenes
use
oil
then
there
were
large
stores
of
nuts
on
the
upper
floor
the
broad
kind
without
a
division
this
was
also
a
chief
article
of
food
with
them
boiled
nuts
and
baked
loaves
wine
was
also
discovered
this
from
its
rough
dry
quality
tasted
sharp
when
drunk
pure
but
mixed
with
water
was
sweet
and
fragrant
chestnuts
the
hellenes
breakfasted
and
then
started
forward
on
their
march
having
first
delivered
the
stronghold
to
their
allies
among
the
mossynoecians
as
for
the
other
strongholds
belonging
to
tribes
allied
with
their
foes
which
they
passed
en
route
the
most
accessible
were
either
deserted
by
their
inhabitants
or
gave
in
their
adhesion
voluntarily
the
following
description
will
apply
to
the
majority
of
them
the
cities
were
on
an
average
ten
miles
apart
some
more
some
less
but
so
elevated
is
the
country
and
intersected
by
such
deep
clefts
that
if
they
chose
to
shout
across
to
one
another
their
cries
would
be
heard
from
one
city
to
another
when
in
the
course
of
their
march
they
came
upon
a
friendly
population
these
would
entertain
them
with
exhibitions
of
fatted
children
belonging
to
the
wealthy
classes
fed
up
on
boiled
chestnuts
until
they
were
as
white
as
white
can
be
of
skin
plump
and
delicate
and
very
nearly
as
broad
as
they
were
long
with
their
backs
variegated
and
their
breasts
tattooed
with
patterns
of
all
sorts
of
flowers
they
sought
after
the
women
in
the
hellenic
army
and
would
fain
have
laid
with
them
openly
in
broad
daylight
for
that
was
their
custom
the
whole
community
male
and
female
alike
were
and
it
was
agreed
that
this
was
the
most
barbaric
and
outlandish
people
that
they
had
passed
through
on
the
whole
expedition
and
the
furthest
removed
from
the
hellenic
customs
doing
in
a
crowd
precisely
what
other
people
would
prefer
to
do
in
solitude
and
when
alone
behaving
exactly
as
others
would
behave
in
company
talking
to
themselves
and
laughing
at
their
own
expense
standing
still
and
then
again
capering
about
wherever
they
might
chance
to
be
without
rhyme
or
reason
as
if
their
sole
business
were
to
show
off
to
the
rest
of
the
world
v
through
this
country
friendly
or
hostile
as
the
chance
might
be
the
hellenes
marched
eight
stages
in
all
and
reached
the
chalybes
these
were
a
people
few
in
number
and
subject
to
the
mossynoecians
their
livelihood
was
for
the
most
part
derived
from
mining
and
forging
iron
thence
they
came
to
the
tibarenians
the
country
of
the
tibarenians
was
far
more
level
and
their
fortresses
lay
on
the
seaboard
and
were
less
strong
whether
by
art
or
nature
the
generals
wanted
to
attack
these
places
so
that
the
army
might
get
some
pickings
and
they
would
not
accept
the
gifts
of
hospitality
which
came
in
from
the
tibarenians
but
bidding
them
wait
till
they
had
taken
counsel
they
proceeded
to
offer
sacrifice
after
several
abortive
attempts
the
seers
at
last
pronounced
an
opinion
that
the
gods
in
no
wise
countenanced
war
then
they
accepted
the
gifts
of
hospitality
and
marching
through
what
was
now
recognised
as
a
friendly
country
in
two
days
reached
cotyora
a
hellenic
city
and
a
colony
of
sinope
albeit
situated
in
the
territory
of
the
tibarenians
the
mss
here
read
up
to
this
point
the
expedition
was
conducted
on
land
and
the
distance
traversed
on
foot
from
the
near
babylon
down
to
cotyora
amounted
to
one
hundred
and
stages
that
is
to
say
six
hundred
and
twenty
parasangs
or
eighteen
thousand
stades
or
if
measured
in
time
an
eight
months
march
the
words
are
probably
the
note
of
some
editor
or
commentator
though
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
author
himself
may
have
gone
through
such
calculations
and
even
have
inserted
them
as
a
note
to
his
text
here
they
halted
days
during
which
they
first
of
all
sacrificed
to
the
gods
and
instituted
processions
each
set
of
the
hellenes
according
to
their
several
tribes
with
gymnastic
contests
provisions
they
got
in
meanwhile
partly
from
paphlagonia
partly
from
the
estates
of
the
cotyorites
for
the
latter
would
neither
provide
them
a
market
nor
receive
their
sick
within
their
walls
meanwhile
ambassadors
arrived
from
sinope
full
of
fears
not
only
for
the
cotyorites
and
their
city
which
belonged
to
sinope
and
brought
in
tribute
but
also
for
the
territory
which
as
they
had
heard
was
being
pillaged
accordingly
they
came
to
the
camp
and
made
a
speech
hecatonymus
who
was
reported
to
be
a
clever
orator
acted
as
their
spokesman
soldiers
he
said
the
city
of
the
sinopeans
has
sent
us
to
offer
you
as
hellenes
our
compliments
and
congratulations
on
your
victories
over
the
barbarians
and
next
to
express
our
joyful
satisfaction
that
you
have
surmounted
all
those
terrible
sufferings
of
which
we
have
heard
and
have
reached
this
place
in
safety
as
hellenes
we
claim
to
receive
at
your
hands
as
kindness
and
not
harm
we
have
certainly
not
ourselves
set
you
an
example
heretofore
of
evil
treatment
now
the
cotyorites
are
our
colonists
it
was
we
who
gave
them
this
country
to
dwell
in
having
taken
it
from
the
barbarians
for
which
reason
also
they
with
the
men
of
cerasus
and
trapezus
pay
us
an
appointed
tribute
so
that
whatever
mischief
you
inflict
on
the
men
of
cotyora
the
city
of
sinope
takes
as
personal
to
herself
at
the
present
time
we
hear
that
you
have
made
forcible
entry
into
their
city
some
of
you
and
are
quartered
in
the
houses
besides
taking
forcibly
from
the
cotyorite
estates
whatever
you
need
by
hook
and
by
crook
now
against
these
things
we
enter
protest
if
you
mean
to
go
on
so
doing
you
will
drive
us
to
make
friends
with
corylas
and
the
paphlagonians
or
any
one
else
we
can
find
to
meet
these
charges
xenophon
on
behalf
of
the
soldiers
rose
and
said
as
to
ourselves
men
of
sinope
having
got
so
far
we
are
well
content
to
have
saved
our
bodies
and
our
arms
indeed
it
was
impossible
at
one
and
the
same
moment
to
keep
our
enemies
at
bay
and
to
despoil
them
of
their
goods
and
chattels
and
now
since
we
have
reached
hellenic
cities
how
has
it
fared
with
us
at
trapezus
they
gave
us
a
market
and
we
paid
for
our
provisions
at
a
fair
market
price
in
return
for
the
honour
they
did
us
and
the
gifts
of
hospitality
they
gave
the
army
we
requited
them
with
honour
where
the
barbarian
was
friendly
to
them
we
stayed
our
hands
from
injury
or
under
their
escort
we
did
damage
to
their
enemies
to
the
utmost
of
our
power
ask
them
what
sort
of
people
they
found
us
they
are
here
some
of
them
to
answer
for
themselves
their
and
the
state
of
trapezus
for
friendship
sake
have
sent
them
with
us
to
act
as
our
guides
but
wherever
we
come
be
it
foreign
or
hellenic
soil
and
find
no
market
for
provisions
we
are
wont
to
help
ourselves
not
out
of
insolence
but
from
necessity
there
have
been
tribes
like
the
carduchians
the
taochians
the
chaldaeans
which
albeit
they
were
not
subject
to
the
great
king
yet
were
no
less
formidable
than
independent
these
we
had
to
bring
over
by
our
arms
the
necessity
of
getting
provisions
forced
us
since
they
refused
to
offer
us
a
market
whereas
some
other
folk
like
the
macrones
in
spite
of
their
being
barbarians
we
regarded
as
our
friends
simply
because
they
did
provide
us
with
the
best
market
in
their
power
and
we
took
no
single
thing
of
theirs
by
force
but
to
come
to
these
cotyorites
whom
you
claim
to
be
your
people
if
we
have
taken
aught
from
them
they
have
themselves
to
blame
for
they
did
not
deal
with
us
as
friends
but
shut
their
gates
in
our
faces
they
would
neither
welcome
us
within
nor
furnish
us
with
a
market
without
the
only
justification
they
alleged
was
that
your
governor
had
authorised
this
conduct
lit
harmost
the
term
denoting
properly
a
governor
of
the
islands
and
foreign
cities
sent
out
by
the
lacedaemonians
during
their
supremacy
came
it
would
seem
to
be
adopted
by
other
greek
communities
under
somewhat
similar
circumstances
cotyora
receives
a
harmost
from
her
sinope
for
the
greek
colonies
here
mentioned
see
kiepert
man
anct
geog
engl
macmillan
as
to
your
assertion
he
continued
turning
to
hecatonymus
that
we
have
got
in
by
force
and
have
taken
up
quarters
this
is
what
we
did
we
requested
them
to
receive
our
sick
and
wounded
under
cover
and
when
they
refused
to
open
their
gates
we
walked
in
where
the
place
itself
invited
us
all
the
violence
we
have
committed
amounts
to
this
that
our
sick
folk
are
quartered
under
cover
paying
for
their
expenses
and
we
keep
a
sentry
at
the
gates
so
that
our
sick
and
wounded
may
not
lie
at
the
mercy
of
your
governor
but
we
may
have
it
in
our
power
to
remove
them
whenever
we
like
the
rest
of
us
you
observe
are
camping
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
in
regular
rank
and
file
and
we
are
ready
to
requite
kindness
with
kindness
but
to
repel
evil
vigorously
and
as
for
your
threat
he
said
once
again
turning
to
the
spokesman
that
you
will
if
it
suits
you
make
alliance
with
corylas
and
the
paphlagonians
to
attack
us
for
our
part
we
have
no
objection
to
fighting
both
sets
of
you
if
so
be
we
must
we
have
already
fought
others
many
times
more
numerous
than
you
besides
it
suits
us
as
you
put
it
to
make
the
paphlagonian
our
friend
report
says
that
he
has
a
hankering
after
your
city
and
some
other
places
on
the
seaboard
we
can
enhance
the
value
of
our
friendship
by
helping
to
win
for
him
what
he
covets
thereupon
the
ambassadors
showed
very
plainly
their
annoyance
with
hecatonymus
on
account
of
the
style
of
his
remarks
and
one
of
them
stept
forward
to
explain
that
their
intention
in
coming
was
not
at
all
to
raise
a
war
but
on
the
contrary
to
demonstrate
their
friendliness
and
if
you
come
to
sinope
itself
the
speaker
continued
we
will
welcome
you
there
with
gifts
of
hospitality
meanwhile
we
will
enjoin
upon
the
citizens
of
this
place
to
give
you
what
they
can
for
we
can
see
that
every
word
of
what
you
say
is
true
thereupon
the
cotyorites
sent
gifts
of
hospitality
and
the
generals
of
the
hellenes
entertained
the
ambassadors
of
the
sinopeans
many
and
friendly
were
the
topics
of
conversation
freely
flowed
the
talk
on
things
in
general
and
in
particular
both
parties
were
able
to
make
inquiries
and
satisfy
their
curiosity
concerning
the
remaining
portion
of
the
march
vi
such
was
the
conclusion
of
that
day
on
the
following
day
the
generals
summoned
an
assembly
of
the
soldiers
when
it
was
resolved
to
invite
the
men
of
sinope
and
to
take
advice
with
them
touching
the
remainder
of
the
journey
in
the
event
of
their
having
to
continue
it
on
foot
the
sinopeans
through
their
acquaintance
with
paphlagonia
would
be
useful
to
them
while
if
they
had
to
go
by
sea
the
services
of
the
same
people
would
be
at
a
premium
for
who
but
they
could
furnish
ships
sufficient
for
the
army
accordingly
they
summoned
their
ambassadors
and
took
counsel
with
them
begging
them
on
the
strength
of
the
sacred
ties
which
bind
hellenes
to
hellenes
to
inaugurate
the
good
reception
they
had
spoken
of
by
present
kindliness
and
their
best
advice
hecatonymus
rose
and
wished
at
once
to
offer
an
apology
with
regard
to
what
he
had
said
about
the
possibility
of
making
friends
with
the
paphlagonians
the
words
were
not
intended
he
said
to
convey
a
threat
as
though
they
were
minded
to
go
to
war
with
the
hellenes
but
as
meaning
rather
albeit
we
have
it
in
our
power
to
be
friendly
with
the
barbarians
we
will
choose
the
hellenes
then
being
urged
to
aid
them
by
some
advice
with
a
pious
ejaculation
he
commenced
if
i
bestow
upon
you
the
best
counsel
i
am
able
god
grant
that
blessings
in
abundance
may
descend
on
me
but
if
the
contrary
may
evil
betide
me
counsel
as
the
saying
goes
well
sirs
if
ever
the
saying
held
it
should
hold
i
think
when
if
i
be
proved
to
have
given
you
good
counsel
i
shall
not
lack
panegyrists
or
if
evil
your
imprecations
will
be
cf
plato
theages
as
to
trouble
i
am
quite
aware
we
shall
have
much
more
trouble
if
you
are
conveyed
by
sea
for
we
must
provide
the
vessels
whereas
if
you
go
by
land
all
the
fighting
will
evolve
on
you
still
let
come
what
may
it
behoves
me
to
state
my
views
i
have
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
country
of
the
paphlagonians
and
their
power
the
country
possesses
the
two
features
of
hill
and
vale
that
is
to
say
the
fairest
plains
and
the
highest
mountains
to
begin
with
the
mountains
i
know
the
exact
point
at
which
you
must
make
your
entry
it
is
precisely
where
the
horns
of
a
mountain
tower
over
both
sides
of
the
road
let
the
merest
handful
of
men
occupy
these
and
they
can
hold
the
pass
with
ease
for
when
that
is
done
not
all
the
enemies
in
the
world
could
effect
a
passage
i
could
point
out
the
whole
with
my
finger
if
you
like
to
send
any
one
with
me
to
the
scene
so
much
for
the
mountain
barrier
but
the
next
thing
i
know
is
that
there
are
plains
and
a
cavalry
which
the
barbarians
themselves
hold
to
be
superior
to
the
entire
cavalry
of
the
great
king
why
only
the
other
day
these
people
refused
to
present
themselves
to
the
summons
of
the
king
their
chief
is
too
proud
for
that
but
now
supposing
you
were
able
to
seize
the
mountain
barrier
by
stealth
or
expedition
before
the
enemy
could
stop
you
supposing
further
you
were
able
to
win
an
engagement
in
the
plain
against
not
only
their
cavalry
but
their
more
than
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
infantry
you
will
only
find
yourself
face
to
face
with
rivers
a
series
of
them
first
the
thermodon
three
hundred
feet
broad
which
i
take
it
will
be
difficult
to
pass
especially
with
a
host
of
foes
in
front
and
another
following
behind
next
comes
the
iris
river
three
hundred
feet
broad
and
thirdly
the
halys
at
least
two
furlongs
broad
which
you
could
not
possibly
cross
without
vessels
and
who
is
going
to
supply
you
with
vessels
in
the
same
way
too
the
parthenius
is
impassable
which
you
will
reach
if
you
cross
the
halys
for
my
part
then
i
consider
the
i
will
not
say
difficult
but
absolutely
impossible
for
you
whereas
if
you
go
by
sea
you
can
coast
along
from
here
to
sinope
and
from
sinope
to
heraclea
from
heraclea
onwards
there
is
no
difficulty
whether
by
land
or
by
sea
for
there
are
plenty
of
vessels
at
heraclea
after
he
had
finished
his
remarks
some
of
his
hearers
thought
they
detected
a
certain
bias
in
them
he
would
not
have
spoken
so
but
for
his
friendship
with
corylas
whose
official
representative
he
was
others
guessed
he
had
an
itching
palm
and
that
he
was
hoping
to
receive
a
present
for
his
sacred
advice
others
again
suspected
that
his
object
was
to
prevent
their
going
by
foot
and
doing
some
mischief
to
the
country
of
the
sinopeans
however
that
might
be
the
hellenes
voted
in
favour
of
continuing
the
journey
by
sea
after
this
xenophon
said
sinopeans
the
army
has
chosen
that
method
of
procedure
which
you
advise
and
thus
the
matter
stands
if
there
are
sure
to
be
vessels
enough
to
make
it
impossible
for
a
single
man
to
be
left
behind
go
by
sea
we
will
but
if
part
of
us
are
to
be
left
while
part
go
by
sea
we
will
not
set
foot
on
board
the
vessels
one
fact
we
plainly
recognise
strength
is
everything
to
us
so
long
as
we
have
the
mastery
we
shall
be
able
to
protect
ourselves
and
get
provisions
but
if
we
are
once
caught
at
the
mercy
of
our
foes
it
is
plain
we
shall
be
reduced
to
slavery
on
hearing
this
the
ambassadors
bade
them
send
an
embassy
which
they
did
to
wit
callimachus
the
arcadian
and
ariston
the
athenian
and
samolas
the
achaean
so
these
set
off
but
meanwhile
a
thought
shaped
itself
in
the
mind
of
xenophon
as
there
before
his
eyes
lay
that
vast
army
of
hellene
hoplites
and
that
other
array
of
peltasts
archers
and
slingers
with
cavalry
to
boot
and
all
in
a
state
of
thorough
efficiency
from
long
practice
hardened
veterans
and
all
collected
in
pontus
where
to
raise
so
large
a
force
would
cost
a
mint
of
money
then
the
idea
dawned
upon
him
how
noble
an
opportunity
to
acquire
new
territory
and
power
for
hellas
by
the
founding
of
a
colony
a
city
of
no
mean
size
moreover
said
he
to
himself
as
he
reckoned
up
their
own
numbers
and
besides
themselves
a
population
planted
on
the
shores
of
pontus
thereupon
he
summoned
silanus
the
ambraciot
the
soothsayer
of
cyrus
above
mentioned
and
before
breathing
a
syllable
to
any
of
the
soldiers
he
consulted
the
victims
by
sacrifice
but
silanus
in
apprehension
lest
these
ideas
might
embody
themselves
and
the
army
be
permanently
halted
at
some
point
or
other
set
a
tale
going
among
the
men
to
the
effect
that
xenophon
was
minded
to
detain
the
army
and
found
a
city
in
order
to
win
himself
a
name
and
acquire
power
silanus
himself
being
minded
to
reach
hellas
with
all
possible
speed
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
had
still
got
the
three
thousand
darics
presented
to
him
by
cyrus
on
the
occasion
of
the
sacrifice
when
he
hit
the
truth
so
happily
about
the
ten
days
silanus
story
was
variously
received
some
few
of
the
soldiers
thinking
it
would
be
an
excellent
thing
to
stay
in
that
country
but
the
majority
were
strongly
averse
the
next
incident
was
that
timasion
the
dardanian
with
thorax
the
boeotian
addressed
themselves
to
some
heracleot
and
sinopean
traders
who
had
come
to
cotyora
and
told
them
that
if
they
did
not
find
means
to
furnish
the
army
with
pay
sufficient
to
keep
them
in
provisions
on
the
homeward
voyage
all
that
great
force
would
most
likely
settle
down
permanently
in
pontus
xenophon
has
a
pet
idea
they
continued
which
he
urges
upon
us
we
are
to
wait
until
the
ships
come
and
then
we
are
suddenly
to
turn
round
to
the
army
and
say
we
now
see
the
straits
we
are
in
unable
to
keep
ourselves
in
provisions
on
the
return
voyage
or
to
make
our
friends
at
home
a
little
present
at
the
end
of
our
journey
but
if
you
like
to
select
some
place
on
the
inhabited
seaboard
of
the
black
sea
which
may
take
your
fancy
and
there
put
in
this
is
open
to
you
to
do
those
who
like
to
go
home
go
those
who
care
to
stay
here
stay
you
have
got
vessels
now
so
that
you
can
make
a
sudden
pounce
upon
any
point
you
choose
the
merchants
went
off
with
this
tale
and
reported
it
to
every
city
they
came
to
in
turn
nor
did
they
go
alone
but
timasion
the
dardanian
sent
a
of
his
own
eurymachus
with
the
boeotian
thorax
to
repeat
the
same
story
so
when
it
reached
the
ears
of
the
men
of
sinope
and
the
heracleots
they
sent
to
timasion
and
pressed
him
to
accept
of
a
gratuity
in
return
for
which
he
was
to
arrange
for
the
departure
of
the
troops
timasion
was
only
too
glad
to
hear
this
and
he
took
the
opportunity
when
the
soldiers
were
convened
in
meeting
to
make
the
following
remarks
soldiers
he
said
do
not
set
your
thoughts
on
staying
here
let
hellas
and
hellas
only
be
the
object
of
your
affection
for
i
am
told
that
certain
persons
have
been
sacrificing
on
this
very
question
without
saying
a
word
to
you
now
i
can
promise
you
if
you
once
leave
these
waters
to
furnish
you
with
regular
monthly
pay
dating
from
the
first
of
the
month
at
the
rate
of
one
cyzicene
a
head
per
month
i
will
bring
you
to
the
troad
from
which
part
i
am
an
exile
and
my
own
state
is
at
your
service
they
will
receive
me
with
open
arms
i
will
be
your
guide
personally
and
i
will
take
you
to
places
where
you
will
get
plenty
of
money
i
know
every
corner
of
the
aeolid
and
phrygia
and
the
troad
and
indeed
the
whole
satrapy
of
pharnabazus
partly
because
it
is
my
birthplace
partly
from
campaigns
in
that
region
with
clearchus
and
dercylidas
a
cyzicene
stater
silver
drachmae
of
attic
money
in
the
time
of
demosthenes
but
like
the
daric
this
gold
coin
would
fluctuate
in
value
relatively
to
silver
it
contained
more
grains
of
gold
than
the
daric
of
dercylidas
we
hear
more
in
the
hellenica
in
he
was
harmost
at
abydos
in
he
superseded
thimbron
in
asia
minor
and
was
himself
superseded
by
agesilaus
in
no
sooner
had
he
ceased
than
up
got
thorax
the
boeotian
this
was
a
man
who
had
a
standing
battle
with
xenophon
about
the
generalship
of
the
army
what
he
said
was
that
if
they
once
got
fairly
out
of
the
euxine
there
was
the
chersonese
a
beautiful
and
prosperous
country
where
they
could
settle
or
not
as
they
chose
those
who
liked
could
stay
and
those
who
liked
could
return
to
their
homes
how
ridiculous
then
when
there
was
so
much
territory
in
hellas
and
to
spare
to
be
poking
about
in
the
land
of
the
barbarian
but
until
you
find
yourselves
there
he
added
i
no
less
than
timasion
can
guarantee
you
regular
pay
this
he
said
knowing
what
promises
had
been
made
timasion
by
the
men
of
heraclea
and
sinope
to
induce
them
to
set
sail
the
word
masteuein
occurs
above
and
again
below
and
in
other
writings
of
our
author
it
is
probably
ionic
or
old
attic
and
occurs
in
poetry
meanwhile
xenophon
held
his
peace
then
up
got
philesius
and
lycon
two
achaeans
it
was
monstrous
they
said
that
xenophon
should
be
privately
persuading
people
to
stop
there
and
consulting
the
victims
for
that
end
without
letting
the
army
into
the
secret
or
breathing
a
syllable
in
public
about
the
matter
when
it
came
to
this
xenophon
was
forced
to
get
up
and
speak
as
follows
sirs
you
are
well
aware
that
my
habit
is
to
sacrifice
at
all
times
whether
in
your
own
behalf
or
my
own
i
strive
in
every
thought
word
and
deed
to
be
directed
as
is
best
for
yourselves
and
for
me
and
in
the
present
instance
my
sole
object
was
to
learn
whether
it
were
better
even
so
much
as
to
broach
the
subject
and
so
take
action
or
to
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
project
now
silanus
the
soothsayer
assured
me
by
his
answer
of
what
was
the
main
point
victims
were
favourable
no
doubt
silanus
knew
that
i
was
not
unversed
myself
in
his
lore
as
i
have
so
often
assisted
at
the
sacrifice
but
he
added
that
there
were
symptoms
in
the
victims
of
some
guile
or
conspiracy
against
me
that
was
a
happy
discovery
on
his
part
seeing
that
he
was
himself
conspiring
at
the
moment
to
traduce
me
before
you
since
it
was
he
who
set
the
tale
going
that
i
had
actually
made
up
my
mind
to
carry
out
these
projects
without
procuring
your
consent
now
for
my
part
if
i
saw
that
you
were
in
any
difficulties
i
should
set
myself
to
discover
how
you
might
capture
a
city
on
the
understanding
of
course
that
all
who
wished
might
sail
away
at
once
leaving
those
who
did
not
wish
to
follow
at
a
later
date
with
something
perhaps
in
their
pockets
to
benefit
their
friends
at
home
now
however
as
i
see
that
the
men
of
heraclea
and
sinope
are
to
send
you
ships
to
assist
you
to
sail
away
and
more
than
one
person
guarantees
to
give
you
regular
monthly
pay
it
is
i
admit
a
rare
chance
to
be
safely
piloted
to
the
haven
of
our
hopes
and
at
the
same
time
to
receive
pay
for
our
preservation
for
myself
i
have
done
with
that
dream
and
to
those
who
came
to
me
to
urge
these
projects
my
advice
is
to
have
done
with
them
in
fact
this
is
my
view
as
long
as
you
stay
together
united
as
you
will
command
respect
and
procure
provisions
for
might
certainly
exercises
a
right
over
what
belongs
to
the
weaker
but
once
broken
up
with
your
force
split
into
bits
you
will
neither
be
able
to
get
subsistence
nor
indeed
will
you
get
off
without
paying
dearly
for
it
in
fact
my
resolution
coincides
precisely
with
yours
it
is
that
we
should
set
off
for
hellas
and
if
any
one
stops
behind
or
is
caught
deserting
before
the
whole
army
is
in
safety
let
him
be
judged
as
an
pray
let
all
who
are
in
favour
of
this
proposition
hold
up
their
hands
they
all
held
them
up
only
silanus
began
shouting
and
vainly
striving
to
maintain
the
right
of
departure
for
all
who
liked
to
depart
but
the
soldiers
would
not
suffer
him
threatening
him
that
if
he
were
himself
caught
attempting
to
run
away
they
would
inflict
the
aforesaid
penalty
after
this
when
the
heracleots
learned
that
the
departure
by
sea
was
resolved
upon
and
that
the
measure
itself
emanated
from
xenophon
they
sent
the
vessels
indeed
but
as
to
the
money
which
they
had
promised
to
timasion
and
thorax
as
pay
for
the
soldiers
they
were
not
as
good
as
their
word
in
fact
they
cheated
them
both
thus
the
two
who
had
guaranteed
regular
monthly
pay
were
utterly
confounded
and
stood
in
terror
of
the
soldiers
what
they
did
then
was
to
take
to
them
the
other
generals
to
whom
they
had
communicated
their
former
transactions
that
is
to
say
all
except
neon
the
asniaean
who
as
was
acting
for
cheirisophus
during
his
continued
absence
this
done
they
came
in
a
body
to
xenophon
and
said
that
their
views
were
changed
as
they
had
now
got
the
ships
they
thought
it
best
to
sail
to
the
phasis
and
seize
the
territory
of
the
phasians
whose
present
king
was
a
descendant
of
aeetes
xenophon
reply
was
curt
not
one
syllable
would
he
have
to
say
himself
to
the
army
in
this
matter
but
he
added
if
you
like
you
can
summon
an
assembly
and
have
your
say
thereupon
timasion
the
dardanian
set
forth
as
his
opinion
it
were
best
to
hold
no
parliament
at
present
but
first
to
go
and
conciliate
each
of
them
his
own
officers
thus
they
went
away
and
proceeded
to
execute
their
plans
aeetes
is
the
patronym
of
the
kings
of
colchis
from
mythical
times
onwards
medea
was
the
daughter
of
aeetes
vii
presently
the
soldiers
came
to
learn
what
was
in
course
of
agitation
and
neon
gave
out
that
xenophon
had
persuaded
the
other
generals
to
adopt
his
views
and
had
a
plan
to
cheat
the
soldiers
and
take
them
back
to
the
phasis
the
soldiers
were
highly
indignant
meetings
were
held
little
groups
gathered
ominously
and
there
seemed
an
alarming
probability
that
they
would
repeat
the
violence
with
which
they
had
lately
treated
the
heralds
of
the
colchians
and
the
clerks
of
the
market
when
all
who
did
not
save
themselves
by
jumping
into
the
sea
were
stoned
to
death
so
xenophon
seeing
what
a
storm
was
brewing
resolved
to
anticipate
matters
so
far
as
to
summon
a
meeting
of
the
men
without
delay
and
thus
prevent
their
collecting
of
their
own
accord
and
he
ordered
the
herald
to
announce
an
assembly
the
voice
of
the
herald
was
no
sooner
heard
than
they
rushed
with
great
readiness
to
the
place
of
meeting
then
xenophon
without
accusing
the
generals
of
having
come
to
him
made
the
following
speech
i
hear
that
a
charge
is
brought
against
me
it
is
i
apparently
who
am
going
to
cheat
you
and
carry
you
off
to
phasis
i
beg
you
by
all
that
is
holy
to
listen
to
me
and
if
there
be
found
any
guilt
in
me
let
me
not
leave
this
place
till
i
have
paid
the
penalty
of
my
misdoing
but
if
my
accusers
are
found
guilty
treat
them
as
they
deserve
i
presume
sirs
you
know
where
the
sun
rises
and
where
he
sets
and
that
he
who
would
go
to
hellas
must
needs
journey
towards
the
sunset
whereas
he
who
seeks
the
land
of
the
barbarian
must
contrariwise
fix
his
face
towards
the
dawn
now
is
that
a
point
in
which
a
man
might
hope
to
cheat
you
could
any
one
make
you
believe
that
the
sun
rises
here
and
sets
there
or
that
he
sets
here
and
rises
there
and
doubtless
you
know
this
too
that
it
is
boreas
the
north
wind
who
bears
the
mariner
out
of
pontus
towards
hellas
and
the
south
wind
inwards
towards
the
phasis
whence
the
saying
the
north
wind
doth
blow
home
to
hellas
we
will
go
whether
this
was
a
local
saying
or
a
proverb
i
can
not
say
the
words
have
a
poetical
ring
about
them
when
borrhas
blows
fair
voyages
to
hellas
he
would
be
a
clever
fellow
who
could
befool
you
into
embarking
with
a
south
wind
blowing
that
sounds
all
very
well
you
think
only
i
may
get
you
on
board
during
a
calm
granted
but
i
shall
be
on
board
my
one
ship
and
you
on
board
another
hundred
at
least
and
how
am
i
to
constrain
you
to
voyage
with
me
against
your
will
or
by
what
cajolery
shall
i
carry
you
off
but
i
will
imagine
you
so
far
befooled
and
bewitched
by
me
that
i
have
got
you
to
the
phasis
we
proceed
to
disembark
on
dry
land
at
last
it
will
come
out
that
wherever
you
are
you
are
not
in
hellas
and
the
inventor
of
the
trick
will
be
one
sole
man
and
you
who
have
been
caught
by
it
will
number
something
like
ten
thousand
with
swords
in
your
hands
i
do
not
know
how
a
man
could
better
ensure
his
own
punishment
than
by
embarking
on
such
a
policy
with
regards
to
himself
and
you
nay
these
tales
are
the
invention
of
silly
fellows
who
are
jealous
of
the
honour
you
bestow
on
me
a
most
jealousy
do
i
hinder
any
of
them
from
speaking
any
word
of
import
in
his
power
of
striking
a
blow
in
your
behalf
and
his
own
if
that
is
his
choice
or
finally
of
keeping
his
eyes
and
ears
open
to
secure
your
safety
what
is
it
in
your
choice
of
leaders
do
i
stand
in
the
way
of
any
one
is
that
it
let
him
step
forward
i
yield
him
place
he
shall
be
your
general
only
he
must
prove
that
he
has
your
good
at
heart
for
myself
i
have
done
but
for
yourselves
if
any
of
you
conceive
either
that
he
himself
could
be
the
victim
of
a
fraud
or
that
he
could
victimise
any
one
else
in
such
a
thing
as
this
let
him
open
his
lips
and
explain
to
us
how
take
your
time
but
when
you
have
sifted
the
matter
to
your
hearts
content
do
not
go
away
without
suffering
me
to
tell
you
of
something
which
i
see
looming
if
it
should
burst
upon
us
and
prove
in
fact
anything
like
what
it
gives
signs
of
being
now
it
is
time
for
us
to
take
counsel
for
ourselves
and
see
that
we
do
not
prove
ourselves
to
be
the
worst
and
basest
of
men
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men
be
they
friends
or
be
they
foes
the
words
moved
the
curiosity
of
the
soldiers
they
marvelled
what
this
matter
might
be
and
bade
him
explain
thereupon
he
began
again
you
will
not
have
forgotten
certain
places
in
the
hills
barbaric
fastnesses
but
friendly
to
the
cerasuntines
from
which
people
used
to
come
down
and
sell
us
large
cattle
and
other
things
which
they
possessed
and
if
i
mistake
not
some
of
you
went
to
the
nearest
of
these
places
and
made
purchases
in
the
market
and
came
back
again
clearetus
the
captain
learnt
of
this
place
that
it
was
but
a
little
one
and
unguarded
why
should
it
be
guarded
since
it
was
friendly
so
the
folk
thought
thus
he
stole
upon
it
in
the
dead
of
night
and
meant
to
sack
it
without
saying
a
word
to
any
of
us
his
design
was
if
he
took
the
place
not
to
return
again
to
the
army
but
to
mount
a
vessel
which
with
his
messmates
on
board
her
was
sailing
past
at
the
time
and
stowing
away
what
he
had
seized
to
set
sail
and
begone
beyond
the
euxine
all
this
had
been
agreed
upon
and
arranged
with
his
comrades
on
board
the
vessel
as
i
now
discover
accordingly
he
summoned
to
his
side
all
whom
he
could
persuade
and
set
off
at
their
head
against
the
little
place
but
dawn
overtook
him
on
his
march
the
men
collected
out
of
their
strongholds
and
whether
from
a
distance
or
close
quarters
made
such
a
fight
that
they
killed
clearetus
and
a
good
many
of
the
rest
and
only
a
few
of
them
got
safe
back
to
cerasus
these
things
took
place
on
the
day
on
which
we
started
to
come
hither
on
foot
while
some
of
those
who
were
to
go
by
sea
were
still
at
cerasus
not
having
as
yet
weighed
anchor
after
this
according
to
what
the
cerasuntines
state
there
arrived
three
inhabitants
of
the
place
which
had
been
attacked
three
elderly
men
seeking
an
interview
with
our
public
assembly
not
finding
us
they
addressed
themselves
to
the
men
of
cerasus
and
told
them
they
were
astonished
that
we
should
have
thought
it
right
to
attack
them
however
when
as
the
cerasuntines
assert
they
had
assured
them
that
the
occurrence
was
not
authorised
by
public
consent
they
were
pleased
and
proposed
to
sail
here
not
only
to
state
to
us
what
had
occurred
but
to
offer
that
those
who
were
interested
should
take
up
and
bury
the
bodies
of
the
slain
but
among
the
hellenes
still
at
cerasus
were
some
of
those
who
had
escaped
they
found
out
in
which
direction
the
barbarians
were
minded
to
go
and
not
only
had
the
face
themselves
to
pelt
them
with
stones
but
vociferously
encouraged
their
neighbours
to
do
the
same
the
three
men
ambassadors
mark
you
were
slain
stoned
to
death
after
this
occurrence
the
men
of
cerasus
came
to
us
and
reported
the
affair
and
we
generals
on
being
informed
were
annoyed
at
what
had
taken
place
and
took
counsel
with
the
cerasuntines
how
the
dead
bodies
of
the
hellenes
might
be
buried
while
seated
in
conclave
outside
the
camp
we
suddenly
were
aware
of
a
great
hubbub
we
heard
cries
them
down
them
them
and
presently
we
caught
sight
of
a
mass
of
people
racing
towards
us
with
stones
in
their
hands
and
others
picking
them
up
the
cerasuntines
naturally
enough
considering
the
incident
they
had
lately
witnessed
retired
in
terror
to
their
vessels
and
upon
my
word
some
of
us
did
not
feel
too
comfortable
all
i
could
do
was
to
go
to
them
and
inquire
what
it
all
meant
some
of
them
had
not
the
slightest
notion
although
they
had
stones
in
their
hands
but
chancing
on
some
one
who
was
better
informed
i
was
told
by
him
that
clerks
of
the
market
were
treating
the
army
most
scandalously
just
then
some
one
got
sight
of
the
market
clerk
zelarchus
making
his
way
off
towards
the
sea
and
lifted
up
his
voice
aloud
and
the
rest
responding
to
the
cry
as
if
a
wild
boar
or
a
stag
had
been
started
they
rushed
upon
him
the
cerasuntines
seeing
a
rush
in
their
direction
thought
that
without
a
doubt
it
was
directed
against
themselves
and
fled
with
all
speed
and
threw
themselves
into
the
sea
in
which
proceeding
they
were
imitated
by
some
few
of
our
own
men
and
all
who
did
not
know
how
to
swim
were
drowned
but
now
what
do
you
think
of
their
case
these
men
of
cerasus
they
had
done
no
wrong
they
were
simply
afraid
that
some
madness
had
seized
us
like
that
to
which
dogs
are
liable
i
say
then
if
proceedings
like
this
are
to
be
the
order
of
the
day
you
had
better
consider
what
the
ultimate
condition
of
the
army
is
like
to
be
as
a
body
you
will
not
have
it
in
your
power
to
undertake
war
against
whom
you
like
or
to
conclude
peace
but
in
private
any
one
who
chooses
will
conduct
the
army
on
any
quest
which
takes
his
fancy
and
when
ambassadors
come
to
you
to
demand
peace
or
whatever
it
may
be
officious
people
will
put
them
to
death
and
prevent
your
hearing
the
proposals
which
brought
them
to
you
the
next
step
will
be
that
those
whom
you
as
a
body
may
choose
as
generals
will
be
of
no
account
but
any
one
who
likes
to
elect
himself
general
and
will
adopt
the
formula
him
shoot
him
will
be
competent
to
cut
down
whomsoever
he
pleases
untried
be
it
general
or
private
soldier
if
only
he
have
sufficient
followers
as
was
the
case
just
now
but
just
consider
what
these
generals
have
achieved
for
you
zelarchus
the
clerk
of
the
market
may
possibly
have
done
you
a
wrong
if
so
he
has
sailed
off
and
is
gone
without
paying
you
any
penalty
or
he
may
be
guiltless
in
which
case
we
have
driven
him
from
the
army
in
terror
of
perishing
unjustly
without
a
trial
while
those
who
stoned
the
ambassadors
have
contrived
so
cleverly
that
we
alone
of
all
hellenes
can
not
approach
cerasus
safely
without
a
strong
force
and
the
corpses
which
the
very
men
who
slew
them
themselves
invited
us
to
bury
we
can
not
now
pick
up
with
safety
even
under
a
flag
of
truce
who
indeed
would
care
to
carry
a
flag
of
truce
or
go
as
a
herald
with
the
blood
of
heralds
upon
his
hands
all
we
could
do
was
to
implore
the
cerasuntines
to
bury
them
if
then
you
approve
of
such
doings
have
a
resolution
passed
to
that
effect
so
that
with
a
prospect
of
like
occurrences
in
the
future
a
man
may
privately
set
up
a
guard
and
do
his
best
to
fix
his
tent
where
he
can
find
a
strong
position
with
a
commanding
site
if
however
these
seem
to
you
to
be
the
deeds
rather
of
wild
beasts
than
of
human
beings
bethink
you
of
some
means
by
which
to
stay
them
or
else
in
heaven
name
how
shall
we
do
sacrifice
to
the
gods
gladly
with
impious
deeds
to
answer
for
or
how
shall
we
who
lay
the
knife
to
each
other
throats
give
battle
to
our
enemies
what
friendly
city
will
receive
us
when
they
see
rampant
lawlessness
in
our
midst
who
will
have
the
courage
to
afford
us
a
market
when
we
prove
our
worthlessness
in
these
weightiest
concerns
and
what
becomes
of
the
praise
we
expect
to
win
from
the
mouths
of
men
who
will
vouchsafe
it
to
us
if
this
is
our
behaviour
should
we
not
ourselves
bestow
the
worst
of
names
on
the
perpetrators
of
like
deeds
after
this
they
rose
and
as
one
man
proposed
that
the
ringleaders
in
these
matters
should
be
punished
and
that
for
the
future
to
set
an
example
of
lawlessness
should
be
forbidden
every
such
ringleader
was
to
be
prosecuted
on
the
capital
charge
the
generals
were
to
bring
all
offenders
to
the
bar
of
justice
prosecutions
for
all
other
misdemeanours
committed
since
the
death
of
cyrus
were
to
be
instituted
and
they
ended
by
constituting
the
officers
into
a
board
of
dicasts
and
upon
the
strong
representation
of
xenophon
with
the
concurrence
of
the
soothsayers
it
was
resolved
to
purify
the
army
and
this
purification
was
made
a
board
of
judges
or
jurors
viii
it
was
further
resolved
that
the
generals
themselves
should
undergo
a
judicial
examination
in
reference
to
their
conduct
in
past
time
in
course
of
investigation
philesius
and
xanthicles
respectively
were
condemned
to
pay
a
sum
of
twenty
minae
to
meet
a
deficiency
to
that
amount
incurred
during
the
guardianship
of
the
cargoes
of
the
merchantmen
sophaenetus
was
fined
ten
minae
for
inadequate
performance
of
his
duty
as
one
of
the
chief
officers
selected
against
xenophon
a
charge
was
brought
by
certain
people
who
asserted
that
they
had
been
beaten
by
him
and
framed
the
indictment
as
one
of
personal
outrage
with
violence
xenophon
got
up
and
demanded
that
the
first
speaker
should
state
where
and
when
it
was
he
had
received
these
blows
the
other
so
challenged
answered
when
we
were
perishing
of
cold
and
there
was
a
great
depth
of
snow
xenophon
said
upon
my
word
with
weather
such
as
you
describe
when
our
provisions
had
run
out
when
the
wine
could
not
even
be
smelt
when
numbers
were
dropping
down
dead
beat
so
acute
was
the
suffering
with
the
enemy
close
on
our
heels
certainly
if
at
such
a
season
as
that
i
was
guilty
of
outrage
i
plead
guilty
to
being
a
more
outrageous
brute
than
the
ass
which
is
too
wanton
they
say
to
feel
fatigue
still
i
wish
you
would
tell
us
said
he
what
led
to
my
striking
you
did
i
ask
you
for
something
and
on
your
refusing
it
to
me
did
i
proceed
to
beat
you
was
it
a
debt
for
which
i
demanded
payment
or
a
quarrel
about
some
boy
or
other
was
i
the
worse
for
liquor
and
behaving
like
a
drunkard
when
the
man
met
each
of
these
questions
with
a
negative
he
questioned
him
further
are
you
a
heavy
infantry
soldier
no
said
he
a
peltast
then
no
nor
yet
a
peltast
but
he
had
been
ordered
by
his
messmates
to
drive
a
mule
although
he
was
a
free
man
then
at
last
he
recognised
him
and
inquired
are
you
the
fellow
who
carried
home
the
sick
man
yes
i
am
said
he
thanks
to
your
driving
and
you
made
havoc
of
my
messmates
kit
havoc
said
xenophon
nay
i
distributed
it
some
to
one
man
some
to
another
to
carry
and
bade
them
bring
the
things
safely
to
me
and
when
i
got
them
back
i
delivered
them
all
safely
to
you
and
you
on
your
side
had
rendered
an
account
to
me
of
the
man
let
me
tell
you
he
continued
turning
to
the
court
what
the
circumstances
were
it
is
worth
hearing
see
the
dict
of
antiq
hybreos
graphe
in
the
case
of
common
assaults
as
opposed
to
indecent
assault
the
prosecution
seems
to
have
been
allowable
only
when
the
object
of
a
wanton
attack
was
a
free
person
cf
arist
rhet
ii
a
man
was
left
behind
from
inability
to
proceed
farther
i
recognised
the
poor
fellow
sufficiently
to
see
that
he
was
one
of
ours
and
i
forced
you
sir
to
carry
him
to
save
his
life
for
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
the
enemy
were
close
at
our
heels
the
fellow
assented
to
this
well
then
said
xenophon
after
i
had
sent
you
forward
i
overtook
you
again
as
i
came
up
with
the
rearguard
you
were
digging
a
trench
with
intent
to
bury
the
man
i
pulled
up
and
said
something
in
commendation
as
we
stood
by
the
poor
fellow
twitched
his
leg
and
the
bystanders
all
cried
out
the
man
alive
your
remark
was
or
not
as
he
likes
i
am
not
going
to
carry
him
then
i
struck
you
yes
you
are
right
for
it
looked
very
much
as
if
you
knew
him
to
be
alive
well
said
he
was
he
any
the
less
dead
when
i
reported
him
to
you
nay
retorted
xenophon
by
the
same
token
we
shall
all
one
day
be
dead
but
that
is
no
reason
why
meantime
we
should
all
be
buried
alive
then
there
was
a
general
shout
if
xenophon
had
given
the
fellow
a
few
more
blows
it
might
have
been
better
the
others
were
now
called
upon
to
state
the
grounds
on
which
they
had
been
beaten
in
each
case
but
when
they
refused
to
get
up
he
proceeded
to
state
them
himself
i
confess
sirs
to
having
struck
certain
men
for
failure
in
discipline
these
were
men
who
were
quite
content
to
owe
their
safety
to
us
whilst
the
rest
of
the
world
marched
on
in
rank
and
did
whatever
fighting
had
to
be
done
they
preferred
to
leave
the
ranks
and
rush
forward
to
loot
and
enrich
themselves
at
our
expense
now
if
this
conduct
were
to
be
the
rule
general
ruin
would
be
the
result
i
do
not
deny
that
i
have
given
blows
to
this
man
or
the
other
who
played
the
poltroon
and
refused
to
get
up
helplessly
abandoning
himself
to
the
enemy
and
so
i
forced
them
to
march
on
for
once
in
the
severe
wintry
weather
i
myself
happened
to
sit
down
for
a
long
time
whilst
waiting
for
a
party
who
were
getting
their
kit
together
and
i
discovered
how
difficult
it
was
to
get
up
again
and
stretch
one
legs
after
this
personal
experience
whenever
i
saw
any
one
else
seated
in
slack
and
lazy
mood
i
tried
to
spur
him
on
the
mere
movement
and
effort
to
play
the
man
caused
warmth
and
moisture
whereas
it
was
plain
that
sitting
down
and
keeping
quiet
helped
the
blood
to
freeze
and
the
toes
to
mortify
calamities
which
really
befell
several
of
the
men
as
you
yourselves
are
aware
i
can
imagine
a
third
case
that
of
some
straggler
stopping
behind
merely
to
rest
for
rest
sake
and
hindering
you
in
front
and
us
behind
alike
from
pressing
on
the
march
if
he
got
a
blow
with
the
fist
from
me
it
saved
him
a
thrust
with
the
lance
from
the
enemy
in
fact
the
opportunity
they
enjoy
of
taking
vengeance
on
me
for
any
treatment
which
i
put
upon
them
wrongfully
is
derived
from
their
salvation
then
whereas
if
they
had
fallen
into
the
enemy
hands
let
them
ask
themselves
for
what
outrage
however
great
they
could
expect
to
get
satisfaction
now
my
defence
he
continued
is
simple
if
i
chastised
any
one
for
his
own
good
i
claim
to
suffer
the
same
penalties
as
parents
pay
their
children
or
masters
their
boys
does
not
the
surgeon
also
cauterise
and
cut
us
for
our
good
but
if
you
really
believe
that
these
acts
are
the
outcome
of
wanton
insolence
i
beg
you
to
observe
that
although
thank
god
i
am
heartier
than
formerly
i
wear
a
bolder
front
now
than
then
and
i
drink
more
wine
yet
i
never
strike
a
soul
no
for
i
see
that
you
have
reached
smooth
water
when
storm
arises
and
a
great
sea
strikes
the
vessel
amidships
a
mere
shake
of
the
head
will
make
the
man
furious
with
the
crew
in
the
forecastle
or
the
helmsman
with
the
men
in
the
stern
sheets
for
at
such
a
crisis
even
a
slight
slip
may
ruin
everything
but
i
appeal
to
your
own
verdict
already
recorded
in
proof
that
i
was
justified
in
striking
these
men
you
stood
by
sirs
with
swords
not
voting
tablets
in
your
hands
and
it
was
in
your
power
to
aid
the
fellows
if
you
liked
but
to
speak
the
honest
truth
you
neither
aided
them
nor
did
you
join
me
in
striking
the
disorderly
in
other
words
you
enabled
any
person
among
them
to
give
rein
to
his
wantonness
by
your
passivity
for
if
you
will
be
at
pains
to
investigate
you
will
find
that
those
who
were
then
most
cowardly
are
the
ringleaders
in
brutality
and
outrage
there
is
boiscus
the
boxer
a
thessalian
what
a
battle
he
fought
then
to
escape
carrying
his
shield
so
tired
was
he
and
i
am
told
he
has
stripped
several
citizens
of
cotyora
of
the
clothes
on
their
backs
if
then
you
are
wise
you
will
treat
this
personage
in
a
way
the
contrary
to
that
in
which
men
treat
dogs
a
savage
dog
is
tied
up
on
the
day
and
loosed
at
night
but
if
you
are
wise
you
will
tie
this
fellow
up
at
night
and
only
let
him
loose
in
the
day
but
really
he
added
it
does
surprise
me
with
what
keenness
you
remember
and
recount
the
times
when
i
incurred
the
hatred
of
some
one
but
some
other
occasions
when
i
eased
the
burden
of
winter
and
storm
for
any
of
you
or
beat
off
an
enemy
or
helped
to
minister
to
you
in
sickness
and
want
not
a
soul
of
you
remembers
these
or
when
for
any
noble
deed
done
by
any
of
you
i
praised
the
doer
and
according
to
my
ability
did
honour
to
this
brave
man
or
that
these
things
have
slipped
from
your
memories
and
are
clean
forgotten
yet
it
were
surely
more
noble
just
and
holy
sweeter
and
kindlier
to
treasure
the
memory
of
good
rather
than
of
evil
he
ended
and
then
one
after
another
of
the
assembly
got
up
and
began
recalling
incidents
of
the
kind
suggested
and
things
ended
not
so
unpleasantly
after

vi
i
after
this
whilst
waiting
they
lived
partly
on
supplies
from
the
market
partly
on
the
fruit
of
raids
into
paphlagonia
the
paphlagonians
on
their
side
showed
much
skill
in
kidnapping
stragglers
wherever
they
could
lay
hands
on
them
and
in
the
night
time
tried
to
do
mischief
to
those
whose
quarters
were
at
a
distance
from
the
camp
the
result
was
that
their
relations
to
one
another
were
exceedingly
hostile
so
much
so
that
corylas
who
was
the
chief
of
paphlagonia
at
that
date
sent
ambassadors
to
the
hellenes
bearing
horses
and
fine
apparel
and
charged
with
a
proposal
on
the
part
of
corylas
to
make
terms
with
the
hellenes
on
the
principle
of
mutual
forbearance
from
injuries
the
generals
replied
that
they
would
consult
with
the
army
about
the
matter
meanwhile
they
gave
them
a
hospitable
reception
to
which
they
invited
certain
members
of
the
army
whose
claims
were
obvious
they
sacrificed
some
of
the
captive
cattle
and
other
sacrificial
beasts
and
with
these
they
furnished
forth
a
sufficiently
festal
entertainment
and
reclining
on
their
truckle
beds
fell
to
eating
and
drinking
out
of
beakers
made
of
horn
which
they
happened
to
find
in
the
country
but
as
soon
as
the
libation
was
ended
and
they
had
sung
the
hymn
up
got
first
some
thracians
who
performed
a
dance
under
arms
to
the
sound
of
a
pipe
leaping
high
into
the
air
with
much
nimbleness
and
brandishing
their
swords
till
at
last
one
man
struck
his
fellow
and
every
one
thought
he
was
really
wounded
so
skilfully
and
artistically
did
he
fall
and
the
paphlagonians
screamed
out
then
he
that
gave
the
blow
stripped
the
other
of
his
arms
and
marched
off
chanting
the
sitalcas
whilst
others
of
the
thracians
bore
off
the
other
who
lay
as
if
dead
though
he
had
not
received
even
a
scratch
the
national
thracian
hymn
for
sitalcas

king

after
this
some
aenianians
and
magnesians
got
up
and
fell
to
dancing
the
carpaea
as
it
is
called
under
arms
this
was
the
manner
of
the
dance
one
man
lays
aside
his
arms
and
proceeds
to
drive
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
while
he
drives
he
sows

him
about
frequently
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
something
up
comes
a
and
no
sooner
does
the
ploughman
catch
sight
of
him
afar
than
he
snatches
up
his
arms
and
confronts
him
they
fight
in
front
of
his
team
and
all
in
rhythm
to
the
sound
of
the
pipe
at
last
the
robber
binds
the
countryman
and
drives
off
the
team
or
sometimes
the
binds
the
robber
and
then
he
puts
him
under
the
yoke
beside
the
oxen
with
his
two
hands
tied
behind
his
back

off

after
this
a
mysian
came
in
with
a
light
shield
in
either
hand
and
danced
at
one
time
going
through
a
pantomime
as
if
he
were
dealing
with
two
assailants
at
once
at
another
plying
his
shields
as
if
to
face
a
single
foe
and
then
again
he
would
whirl
about
and
throw
somersaults
keeping
the
shields
in
his
hands
so
that
it
was
a
beautiful
spectacle
last
of
all
he
danced
the
persian
dance
clashing
the
shields
together
crouching
down
on
one
knee
and
springing
up
again
from
earth
and
all
this
he
did
in
measured
time
to
the
sound
of
the
flute
after
him
the
mantineans
stepped
upon
the
stage
and
some
other
arcadians
also
stood
up
they
had
accoutred
themselves
in
all
their
warlike
finery
they
marched
with
measured
tread
pipes
playing
to
the
tune
of
the
march
the
notes
of
the
paean
rose
lightly
their
limbs
moved
in
dance
as
in
solemn
procession
to
the
holy
gods
the
paphlagonians
looked
upon
it
as
something
truly
strange
that
all
these
dances
should
be
under
arms
and
the
mysians
seeing
their
astonishment
persuaded
one
of
the
arcadians
who
had
got
a
dancing
girl
to
let
him
introduce
her
which
he
did
after
dressing
her
up
magnificently
and
giving
her
a
light
shield
when
lithe
of
limb
she
danced
the
pyrrhic
loud
clapping
followed
and
the
paphlagonians
asked
if
these
women
fought
by
their
side
in
battle
to
which
they
answered
to
be
sure
it
was
the
women
who
routed
the

between

there
was
to
be

the

soon
as

at

the
army
halted
five
days
and
now
that
they
seemed
to
be
so
close
to
hellas
the
question
how
they
were
to
reach
home
not
presented
itself
more
forcibly
to
their
minds
than
heretofore
the
conclusion
they
came
to
was
to
appoint
a
single
general
since
one
man
would
be
better
able
to
handle
the
troops
by
night
or
by
day
than
was
possible
while
the
generalship
was
divided
if
secrecy
were
desirable
it
would
be
easier
to
keep
matters
dark
or
if
again
expedition
were
an
object
there
would
be
less
risk
of
arriving
a
day
too
late
since
mutual
explanations
would
be
avoided
and
whatever
approved
itself
to
the
single
judgement
would
at
once
be
carried
into
effect
whereas
previously
the
generals
had
done
everything
in
obedience
to
the
opinion
of
the
majority
with
these
ideas
working
in
their
minds
they
turned
to
xenophon
and
the
officers
came
to
him
and
told
him
that
this
was
how
the
soldiers
viewed
matters
and
each
of
them
displaying
a
warmth
of
kindly
feeling
pressed
him
to
accept
the
office
xenophon
partly
would
have
liked
to
do
so
in
the
belief
that
by
so
doing
he
would
win
to
himself
a
higher
repute
in
the
esteem
of
his
friends
and
that
his
name
would
be
reported
to
the
city
written
large
and
by
some
stroke
of
fortune
he
might
even
be
the
discoverer
of
some
blessing
to
the
army
collectively
these
and
the
like
considerations
elated
him
he
had
a
strong
desire
to
hold
the
supreme
command
but
then
again
as
he
turned
the
matter
over
the
conviction
deepened
in
his
mind
that
the
issue
of
the
future
is
to
every
man
uncertain
and
hence
there
was
the
risk
of
perhaps
losing
such
reputation
has
he
had
already
acquired
he
was
in
sore
straights
and
not
knowing
how
to
decide
it
seemed
best
to
him
to
lay
the
matter
before
heaven
accordingly
he
led
two
victims
to
the
altar
and
made
sacrifice
to
zeus
the
king
for
it
was
he
and
no
other
who
had
been
named
by
the
oracle
at
delphi
and
his
belief
was
that
the
vision
which
he
had
beheld
when
he
first
essayed
to
undertake
the
joint
administration
of
the
army
was
sent
to
him
by
that
god
he
also
recalled
to
mind
a
circumstance
which
befell
him
still
earlier
when
setting
out
from
ephesus
to
associate
himself
with
cyrus
how
an
eagle
screamed
on
his
right
hand
from
the
east
and
still
remained
perched
and
the
soothsayer
who
was
escorting
him
said
that
it
was
a
great
and
royal
omen
indicating
glory
and
yet
suffering
for
the
punier
race
of
birds
only
attack
the
eagle
when
seated
yet
added
he
it
bodes
not
gain
in
money
for
the
eagle
seizes
his
food
not
when
seated
but
on
the
wing
cf
cyrop
ii
i
an
eagle
appears
to
cyrus
on
the
frontiers
of
persia
when
about
to
join
his
uncle
cyaxares
king
of
media
on
his
expedition
against
the
assyrian
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
greek
word
oionos
a
solitary
or
bird
also
means
an
omen
it
was
a
mighty
bird
and
a
mighty
omen
thus
xenophon
sacrificed
and
the
god
as
plainly
as
might
be
gave
him
a
sign
neither
to
demand
the
generalship
nor
if
chosen
to
accept
the
office
and
that
was
how
the
matter
stood
when
the
army
met
and
the
proposal
to
elect
a
single
leader
was
unanimous
after
this
resolution
was
passed
they
proposed
xenophon
for
election
and
when
it
seemed
quite
evident
that
they
would
elect
him
if
he
put
the
question
to
the
vote
he
got
up
and
spoke
as
follows
sirs
i
am
but
mortal
and
must
needs
be
happy
to
be
honoured
by
you
i
thank
you
and
am
grateful
and
my
prayer
is
that
the
gods
may
grant
me
to
be
an
instrument
of
blessing
to
you
still
when
i
consider
it
closer
thus
in
the
presence
of
a
lacedaemonian
to
be
preferred
by
you
as
general
seems
to
me
but
ill
conducive
either
to
your
interests
or
to
mine
since
you
will
the
less
readily
obtain
from
them
hereafter
anything
you
may
need
while
for
myself
i
look
upon
acceptance
as
even
somewhat
dangerous
do
i
not
see
and
know
with
what
persistence
these
lacedaemonians
prosecuted
the
war
till
finally
they
forced
our
state
to
acknowledge
the
leadership
of
lacedaemon
this
confession
once
extorted
from
their
antagonists
they
ceased
warring
at
once
and
the
siege
of
the
city
was
at
an
end
if
with
these
facts
before
my
eyes
i
seem
to
be
doing
all
i
can
to
neutralise
their
high
i
can
not
escape
the
reflection
that
personally
i
may
be
taught
wisdom
by
a
painful
process
but
with
your
own
idea
that
under
a
single
general
there
will
be
less
factiousness
than
when
there
were
many
be
assured
that
in
choosing
some
other
than
me
you
will
not
find
me
factious
i
hold
that
whosoever
sets
up
factious
opposition
to
his
leader
factiously
opposes
his
own
safety
while
if
you
determine
to
choose
me
i
should
not
be
surprised
were
that
choice
to
entail
upon
you
and
me
the
resentment
of
other
people
after
those
remarks
on
xenophon
part
many
more
got
up
one
after
another
insisting
on
the
propriety
of
his
undertaking
the
command
one
of
them
agasias
the
stymphalian
said
it
was
really
ridiculous
if
things
had
come
to
this
pass
that
the
lacedeamonians
are
to
fly
into
a
rage
because
a
number
of
friends
have
met
together
to
dinner
and
omitted
to
choose
a
lacedaemonian
to
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
really
if
that
is
how
matters
stand
said
he
i
do
not
see
what
right
we
have
to
be
officers
even
we
who
are
only
arcadians
that
sally
brought
down
the
plaudits
of
the
assembly
and
xenophon
seeing
that
something
more
was
needed
stepped
forward
again
and
spoke
pardon
sirs
he
said
let
me
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
swear
to
you
by
all
the
gods
and
goddesses
verily
and
indeed
i
no
sooner
perceived
your
purpose
than
i
consulted
the
victims
whether
it
was
better
for
you
to
entrust
this
leadership
to
me
and
for
me
to
undertake
it
or
the
reverse
and
the
gods
vouchsafed
a
sign
to
me
so
plain
that
even
a
common
man
might
understand
it
and
perceive
that
from
such
sovereignty
i
must
needs
hold
myself
aloof
under
these
circumstances
they
chose
cheirisophus
who
after
his
election
stepped
forward
and
said
nay
sirs
be
well
assured
of
this
that
had
you
chosen
some
one
else
i
for
my
part
should
not
have
set
up
factious
opposition
as
to
xenophon
i
believe
you
have
done
him
a
good
turn
by
not
appointing
him
for
even
now
dexippus
has
gone
some
way
in
traducing
him
to
anaxibius
as
far
as
it
lay
in
his
power
to
do
so
and
that
in
spite
of
my
attempts
to
silence
him
what
he
said
was
that
he
believed
xenophon
would
rather
share
the
command
of
clearchus
army
with
timasion
a
dardanian
than
with
himself
a
laconian
but
continued
cheirisophus
since
your
choice
has
fallen
upon
me
i
will
make
it
my
endeavour
to
do
you
all
the
good
in
my
power
so
make
your
preparations
to
weigh
anchor
wind
and
weather
permitting
we
will
voyage
to
heraclea
every
one
must
endeavour
therefore
to
put
in
at
that
port
and
for
the
rest
we
will
consult
when
we
are
come
thither
ii
the
next
day
they
weighed
anchor
and
set
sail
from
harmene
with
a
fair
breeze
two
days
voyage
along
the
coast
as
they
coasted
along
they
came
in
sight
of
jason
beach
where
as
the
story
says
the
ship
argo
came
to
moorings
and
then
the
mouths
of
the
rivers
first
the
thermodon
then
the
iris
then
the
halys
and
next
to
it
the
parthenius
coasting
past
the
latter
they
reached
heraclea
a
hellenic
city
and
a
colony
of
the
megarians
situated
in
the
territory
of
the
mariandynians
so
they
came
to
anchorage
off
the
acherusian
chersonese
where
heracles
is
said
to
have
descended
to
bring
up
the
dog
cerberus
at
a
point
where
they
still
show
the
marks
of
his
descent
a
deep
cleft
more
than
two
furlongs
down
here
the
heracleots
sent
the
hellenes
as
gifts
of
hospitality
three
thousand
measures
of
barley
and
two
thousand
jars
of
wine
twenty
beeves
and
one
hundred
sheep
through
the
flat
country
here
flows
the
lycus
river
as
it
is
called
about
two
hundred
feet
in
breadth
i
have
left
this
passage
in
the
text
although
it
involves
at
first
sight
a
topographical
error
on
the
part
of
whoever
wrote
it
and
hug
and
other
commentators
regard
it
as
spurious
beach
the
modern
yasoun
bouroun
and
the
three
rivers
lie
between
cotyora
and
sinope
possibly
the
author
or
one
of
his
editors
somewhat
loosely
inserted
a
recapitulatory
note
concerning
the
scenery
of
this
coasting
voyage
at
this
point
by
the
way
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
as
they
coasted
along
etc
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
commercial
cities
distinguished
as
pontica
whence
in
the
middle
ages
penteraklia
now
eregli
it
was
one
of
the
older
greek
settlements
and
like
kalchedon
to
give
that
town
its
proper
name
a
colony
see
kiepert
op
cit
chap
iv
according
to
another
version
of
the
legend
heracles
went
down
to
bring
up
cerberus
not
here
but
at
taenarum
the
soldiers
held
a
meeting
and
took
counsel
about
the
remainder
of
the
journey
should
they
make
their
exit
from
the
pontus
by
sea
or
by
land
and
lycon
the
achaean
got
up
and
said
i
am
astonished
sirs
that
the
generals
do
not
endeavour
to
provide
us
more
efficiently
with
provisions
these
gifts
of
hospitality
will
not
afford
three
days
victuals
for
the
army
nor
do
i
see
from
what
region
we
are
to
provide
ourselves
as
we
march
my
proposal
therefore
is
to
demand
of
the
heracleots
at
least
three
thousand
cyzicenes
another
speaker
suggested
not
less
than
ten
thousand
let
us
at
once
before
we
break
up
this
meeting
send
ambassadors
to
the
city
and
ascertain
their
answer
to
the
demand
and
take
counsel
accordingly
thereupon
they
proceeded
to
put
up
as
ambassadors
first
and
foremost
cheirisophus
as
he
had
been
chosen
others
also
named
xenophon
but
both
cheirisophus
and
xenophon
stoutly
declined
maintaining
both
alike
that
they
could
not
compel
a
hellenic
city
actually
friendly
to
give
anything
which
they
did
not
spontaneously
offer
so
since
these
two
appeared
to
be
backward
the
soldiers
sent
lycon
the
achaean
callimachus
the
parrhasian
and
agasias
the
stymphalian
these
three
went
and
announced
the
resolutions
passed
by
the
army
lycon
it
was
said
even
went
so
far
as
to
threaten
certain
consequences
in
case
they
refused
to
comply
the
heracleots
said
they
would
deliberate
and
without
more
ado
they
got
together
their
goods
and
chattels
from
their
farms
and
fields
outside
and
dismantled
the
market
outside
and
transferred
it
within
after
which
the
gates
were
closed
and
arms
appeared
at
the
battlements
of
the
walls
at
that
check
the
authors
of
these
tumultuary
measures
fell
to
accusing
the
generals
as
if
they
had
marred
the
proceeding
and
the
arcadians
and
archaeans
banded
together
chiefly
under
the
auspices
of
the
two
ringleaders
callimachus
the
parrhasian
and
lycon
the
achaean
the
language
they
held
was
to
this
effect
it
was
outrageous
that
a
single
athenian
and
a
lacedaemonian
who
had
not
contributed
a
soldier
to
the
expedition
should
rule
peloponnesians
scandalous
that
they
themselves
should
bear
the
toils
whilst
others
pocketed
the
spoils
and
that
too
though
the
preservation
of
the
army
was
due
to
themselves
for
as
every
one
must
admit
to
the
arcadians
and
achaeans
the
credit
of
that
achievement
was
due
and
the
rest
of
the
army
went
for
nothing
which
was
indeed
so
far
true
that
the
arcadians
and
achaeans
did
form
numerically
the
larger
half
of
the
whole
army
what
then
did
common
sense
suggest
why
that
they
the
arcadians
and
achaeans
should
make
common
cause
choose
generals
for
themselves
independently
continue
the
march
and
try
somewhat
to
better
their
condition
this
proposal
was
carried
all
the
arcadians
and
achaeans
who
chanced
to
be
with
cheirisophus
left
him
and
xenophon
setting
up
for
themselves
and
choosing
ten
generals
of
their
own
these
ten
it
was
decreed
were
to
put
into
effect
such
measures
as
approved
themselves
to
the
majority
thus
the
absolute
authority
vested
in
cheirisophus
was
terminated
there
and
then
within
less
than
a
week
of
his
appointment
xenophon
however
was
minded
to
prosecute
the
journey
in
their
company
thinking
that
this
would
be
a
safer
plan
than
for
each
to
start
on
his
own
account
but
neon
threw
in
his
weight
in
favour
of
separate
action
every
one
for
himself
he
said
for
he
had
heard
from
cheirisophus
that
cleander
the
spartan
at
byzantium
talked
of
coming
to
calpe
haven
with
some
war
vessels
neon
advice
was
due
to
his
desire
to
secure
a
passage
home
in
these
war
vessels
for
themselves
and
their
soldiers
without
allowing
any
one
else
to
share
in
their
as
for
cheirisophus
he
was
at
once
so
out
of
heart
at
the
turn
things
had
taken
and
soured
with
the
whole
army
that
he
left
it
to
his
subordinate
neon
to
do
just
what
he
liked
xenophon
on
his
side
would
still
have
been
glad
to
be
quit
of
the
expedition
and
sail
home
but
on
offering
sacrifice
to
heracles
the
leader
and
seeking
advice
whether
it
were
better
and
more
desirable
to
continue
the
march
in
charge
of
the
soldiers
who
had
remained
faithful
or
to
take
his
departure
the
god
indicated
to
him
by
the
victims
that
he
should
adopt
the
former
course
in
this
way
the
army
was
now
split
up
into
three
divisions
first
the
arcadians
and
achaeans
over
four
thousand
five
hundred
men
all
heavy
infantry
secondly
cheirisophus
and
his
men
viz
one
thousand
four
hundred
heavy
infantry
and
the
seven
hundred
peltasts
or
clearchus
thracians
thirdly
xenophon
division
of
one
thousand
seven
hundred
heavy
infantry
and
three
hundred
peltasts
but
then
he
alone
had
the
cavalry
about
forty
troopers
the
total
now
amounted
to
and
over
the
arcadians
who
had
bargained
with
the
heracleots
and
got
some
vessels
from
them
were
the
first
to
set
sail
they
hoped
by
pouncing
suddenly
on
the
bithynians
to
make
as
large
a
haul
as
possible
with
that
object
they
disembarked
at
calpe
haven
pretty
nearly
at
the
middle
point
in
thrace
cheirisophus
setting
off
straight
from
heraclea
commenced
a
land
march
through
the
country
but
having
entered
into
thrace
he
preferred
to
cling
to
the
seaboard
health
and
strength
failing
him
xenophon
lastly
took
vessels
and
disembarking
on
the
confines
of
thrace
and
the
heracleotid
pushed
forward
through
the
heart
of
the
country
the
haven
of
calpe
kirpe
liman
or
karpe
in
the
modern
maps
the
name
is
interesting
as
being
also
the
ancient
name
of
the
rock
fortress
of
gibraltar
some
mss
here
read
in
the
prior
chapter
will
be
found
a
description
of
the
manner
in
which
the
absolute
command
of
cheirisophus
was
abruptly
terminated
and
the
army
of
the
hellenes
broken
up
the
sequel
will
show
how
each
of
these
divisions
fared
the
passage
is
probably
one
of
those
commentators
notes
with
which
we
are
now
familiar
iii
the
arcadians
disembarking
under
cover
of
night
at
calpe
haven
marched
against
the
nearest
villages
about
thirty
furlongs
from
the
sea
and
as
soon
as
it
was
light
each
of
the
ten
generals
led
his
company
to
attack
one
village
or
if
the
village
were
large
a
couple
of
companies
advanced
under
their
combined
generals
they
further
agreed
upon
a
certain
knoll
where
they
were
all
eventually
to
assemble
so
sudden
was
their
attack
that
they
seized
a
number
of
captives
and
enclosed
a
multitude
of
small
cattle
but
the
thracians
who
escaped
began
to
collect
again
for
being
troops
they
had
slipped
in
large
numbers
through
the
hands
of
the
heavy
infantry
and
now
that
they
were
got
together
they
first
attacked
the
company
of
the
arcadian
general
smicres
who
had
done
his
work
and
was
retiring
to
the
appointed
driving
along
a
large
train
of
captives
and
cattle
for
a
good
while
the
hellenes
maintained
a
running
fight
but
at
the
passage
of
a
gorge
the
enemy
routed
them
slaying
smicres
himself
and
those
with
him
to
a
man
the
fate
of
another
company
under
command
of
hegesander
another
of
the
ten
was
nearly
as
bad
only
eight
men
escaped
hegesander
being
one
of
them
the
remaining
captains
eventually
met
some
with
somewhat
to
show
for
their
pains
others
lit
marched
and
fought
as
did
the
forlorn
hope
under
sir
wilson
making
its
way
from
abu
klea
to
the
nile
in
the
thracians
having
achieved
this
success
kept
up
a
continual
shouting
and
clatter
of
conversation
to
one
another
during
the
night
but
with
they
marshalled
themselves
right
round
the
knoll
on
which
the
hellenes
were
encamped
both
cavalry
in
large
numbers
and
troops
while
every
minute
the
stream
of
grew
greater
then
they
commenced
an
attack
on
the
heavy
infantry
in
all
security
for
the
hellenes
had
not
a
single
bowman
or
mounted
trooper
amongst
them
while
the
enemy
rushed
forward
on
foot
or
galloped
up
on
horseback
and
let
fly
their
javelins
it
was
vain
to
attempt
to
retaliate
so
lightly
did
they
spring
back
and
escape
and
ever
the
attack
renewed
itself
from
every
point
so
that
on
one
side
man
after
man
was
wounded
on
the
other
not
a
soul
was
touched
the
result
being
that
they
could
not
stir
from
their
position
and
the
thracians
ended
by
cutting
them
off
even
from
their
water
in
their
despair
they
began
to
parley
about
a
truce
and
finally
various
concessions
were
made
and
terms
agreed
to
between
them
but
the
thracians
would
not
hear
of
giving
hostages
in
answer
to
the
demand
of
the
hellenes
at
that
point
the
matter
rested
so
fared
it
with
the
arcadians
as
to
cheirisophus
that
general
prosecuted
his
march
along
the
seaboard
and
without
check
reached
calpe
haven
xenophon
advanced
through
the
heart
of
the
country
and
his
cavalry
pushing
on
in
front
came
upon
some
old
men
pursuing
their
road
somewither
who
were
brought
to
him
and
in
answer
to
his
question
whether
they
had
caught
sight
of
another
hellenic
army
anywhere
told
him
all
that
had
already
taken
place
adding
that
at
present
they
were
being
besieged
upon
a
knoll
with
all
the
thracians
in
close
circle
round
them
thereupon
he
kept
the
old
men
under
strict
guard
to
serve
as
guides
in
case
of
need
next
having
appointed
outposts
he
called
a
meeting
of
the
soldiers
and
addressed
them
soldiers
some
of
the
arcadians
are
dead
and
the
rest
are
being
besieged
upon
a
certain
knoll
now
my
own
belief
is
that
if
they
are
to
perish
with
their
deaths
the
seal
is
set
to
our
own
fate
since
we
must
reckon
with
an
enemy
at
once
numerous
and
emboldened
clearly
our
best
course
is
to
hasten
to
their
rescue
if
haply
we
may
find
them
still
alive
and
do
battle
by
their
side
rather
than
suffer
isolation
confronting
danger
let
us
then
at
once
push
forward
as
far
as
may
seem
opportune
till
and
then
encamp
as
long
as
we
are
marching
let
timasion
with
the
cavalry
gallop
on
in
front
but
without
losing
sight
of
us
and
let
him
examine
all
closely
in
front
so
that
nothing
may
escape
our
observation
at
the
same
time
too
he
sent
out
some
nimble
fellows
of
the
troops
to
the
flanks
and
to
the
high
tops
who
were
to
give
a
signal
if
they
espied
anything
anywhere
ordering
them
to
burn
everything
inflammable
which
lay
in
their
path
as
for
ourselves
he
continued
we
need
not
look
to
find
cover
in
any
direction
for
it
is
a
long
step
back
to
heraclea
and
a
long
leap
across
to
chrysopolis
and
the
enemy
is
at
the
door
the
shortest
road
is
to
calpe
haven
where
we
suppose
cheirisophus
if
safe
to
be
but
then
when
we
get
there
at
calpe
haven
there
are
no
vessels
for
us
to
sail
away
in
and
if
we
stop
here
we
have
not
provisions
for
a
single
day
suppose
the
beleaguered
arcadians
left
to
their
fate
we
shall
find
it
but
a
sorry
alternative
to
run
the
gauntlet
with
cheirisophus
detachment
alone
better
to
save
them
if
we
can
and
with
united
forces
work
out
our
deliverance
in
common
but
if
so
we
must
set
out
with
minds
prepared
since
either
a
glorious
death
awaits
us
or
the
achievement
of
a
deed
of
noblest
emprise
in
the
rescue
of
so
many
hellene
lives
maybe
it
is
god
who
leads
us
thus
god
who
chooses
to
humble
the
proud
boaster
boasting
as
though
he
were
exceedingly
wise
but
for
us
the
beginning
of
whose
every
act
is
by
heaven
grace
that
same
god
reserves
a
higher
grade
of
honour
one
duty
i
would
recall
to
you
to
apply
your
minds
to
the
execution
of
the
orders
with
promptitude
with
these
words
he
led
the
way
the
cavalry
scattering
as
far
in
advance
as
was
prudent
wherever
they
set
foot
set
fire
the
peltasts
moving
parallel
on
the
high
ground
were
similarly
employed
burning
everything
combustible
they
could
discover
while
the
main
army
wherever
they
came
upon
anything
which
had
accidentally
escaped
completed
the
work
so
that
the
whole
country
looked
as
if
it
were
ablaze
and
the
army
might
easily
pass
for
a
larger
one
when
the
hour
had
come
they
turned
aside
to
a
knoll
and
took
up
quarters
and
there
they
espied
the
enemy
he
was
about
forty
furlongs
distant
on
their
side
also
they
kindled
as
many
as
possible
but
as
soon
as
they
had
dined
the
order
was
passed
to
quench
all
the
fires
so
during
the
night
they
posted
guards
and
slept
but
at
daybreak
they
offered
prayers
to
the
gods
and
drawing
up
in
order
of
battle
began
marching
with
what
speed
they
might
timasion
and
the
cavalry
who
had
the
guides
with
them
and
were
moving
on
briskly
in
front
found
themselves
without
knowing
it
at
the
very
knoll
upon
which
the
hellenes
had
been
beleaguered
but
no
army
could
they
discover
whether
of
friend
or
foe
only
some
starveling
old
women
and
men
with
a
few
sheep
and
oxen
which
had
been
left
behind
this
news
they
reported
to
xenophon
and
the
main
body
at
first
the
marvel
was
what
had
happened
but
ere
long
they
found
out
by
inquiries
from
the
folk
who
had
been
left
behind
that
the
thracians
had
set
off
immediately
after
sundown
and
were
gone
the
hellenes
had
waited
till
morning
before
they
made
off
but
in
what
direction
they
could
not
say
on
hearing
this
xenophon
troops
first
breakfasted
and
then
getting
their
kit
together
began
their
march
desiring
to
unite
with
the
rest
at
calpe
haven
without
loss
of
time
as
they
continued
their
march
they
came
across
the
track
of
the
arcadians
and
achaeans
along
the
road
to
calpe
and
both
divisions
arriving
eventually
at
the
same
place
were
overjoyed
to
see
one
another
again
and
they
embraced
each
other
like
brothers
then
the
arcadians
inquired
of
officers
why
they
had
quenched
the
at
first
said
they
when
we
lost
sight
of
your
we
expected
you
to
attack
the
enemy
in
the
night
and
the
enemy
so
at
least
we
imagined
must
have
been
afraid
of
that
and
so
set
off
the
time
at
any
rate
at
which
they
set
off
would
correspond
but
when
the
requisite
time
had
elapsed
and
you
did
not
come
we
concluded
that
you
must
have
learnt
what
was
happening
to
us
and
in
terror
had
made
a
bolt
for
it
to
the
seaboard
we
resolved
not
to
be
left
behind
by
you
and
that
is
how
we
also
came
to
march
hither
iv
during
this
day
they
contented
themselves
with
bivouacking
there
on
the
beach
at
the
harbour
the
place
which
goes
by
the
name
of
calpe
haven
is
in
asiatic
thrace
the
name
given
to
a
region
extending
from
the
mouth
of
the
euxine
all
the
way
to
heraclea
which
lies
on
the
right
hand
as
you
sail
into
the
euxine
it
is
a
long
day
voyage
for
a
using
her
three
banks
of
oars
from
byzantium
to
heraclea
and
between
these
two
there
is
not
a
single
hellenic
or
friendly
city
but
only
these
bithynian
thracians
who
have
a
bad
reputation
for
the
savagery
with
which
they
treat
any
hellenes
cast
ashore
by
shipwreck
or
otherwise
thrown
into
their
power
now
the
haven
of
calpe
lies
exactly
midway
halving
the
voyage
between
byzantium
and
heraclea
it
is
a
long
promontory
running
out
into
the
sea
the
seaward
portion
being
a
rocky
precipice
at
no
point
less
than
twenty
fathoms
high
but
on
the
landward
side
there
is
a
neck
about
four
hundred
feet
wide
and
the
space
inside
the
neck
is
capable
of
accommodating
ten
thousand
inhabitants
and
there
is
a
haven
immediately
under
the
crag
with
a
beach
facing
the
west
then
there
is
a
copious
spring
of
fresh
water
flowing
on
the
very
marge
of
the
sea
commanded
by
the
stronghold
again
there
is
plenty
of
wood
of
various
sorts
but
most
plentiful
of
all
fine
shipbuilding
timber
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
sea
the
upland
stretches
into
the
heart
of
the
country
for
twenty
furlongs
at
least
it
is
good
loamy
soil
free
from
stones
for
a
still
greater
distance
the
seaboard
is
thickly
grown
with
large
timber
trees
of
every
description
the
surrounding
country
is
beautiful
and
spacious
containing
numerous
well
populated
villages
the
soil
produces
barley
and
wheat
and
pulse
of
all
sorts
millet
and
sesame
figs
in
ample
supply
with
numerous
vines
producing
sweet
wines
and
indeed
everything
else
except
olives
such
is
the
character
of
the
country
the
tents
were
pitched
on
the
beach
the
soldiers
being
altogether
averse
to
camping
on
ground
which
might
so
easily
be
converted
into
a
city
indeed
their
arrival
at
the
place
at
all
seemed
very
like
the
crafty
design
of
some
persons
who
were
minded
to
form
a
city
the
aversion
was
not
unnatural
since
the
majority
of
the
soldiers
had
not
left
their
homes
on
so
long
a
voyage
from
scantiness
or
subsistence
but
attracted
by
the
fame
of
cyrus
virtues
some
of
them
bringing
followers
while
others
had
expended
money
on
the
expedition
and
amongst
them
was
a
third
set
who
had
run
away
from
fathers
and
mothers
while
a
different
class
had
left
children
behind
hoping
to
return
to
them
with
money
or
other
gains
other
people
with
cyrus
won
great
success
they
were
told
why
should
it
not
be
so
with
them
being
persons
then
of
this
description
the
one
longing
of
their
hearts
was
to
reach
hellas
safely
his
society
was
itself
a
passport
to
good
fortune
it
was
on
the
day
after
their
meeting
that
xenophon
sacrificed
as
a
preliminary
to
a
military
expedition
for
it
was
needful
to
march
out
in
search
of
provisions
besides
which
he
designed
burying
the
dead
as
soon
as
the
victims
proved
favourable
they
all
setout
the
arcadians
following
with
the
rest
the
majority
of
the
dead
who
had
lain
already
five
days
they
buried
just
where
they
had
fallen
in
groups
to
remove
their
bodies
now
would
have
been
impossible
some
few
who
lay
off
the
roads
they
got
together
and
buried
with
what
splendour
they
could
considering
the
means
in
their
power
others
they
could
not
find
and
for
these
they
erected
a
great
cenotaph
and
covered
it
with
wreaths
when
it
was
all
done
they
returned
home
to
camp
at
that
time
they
supped
and
went
to
rest
cenotaph
an
empty
tomb
the
word
is
interesting
as
occurring
only
in
xenophon
until
we
come
to
the
writers
of
the
common
dialect
compare
hyuscyamus
hogbean
our
henbane
which
we
also
owe
to
xenophon

next
day
there
was
a
general
meeting
of
the
soldiers
collected
chiefly
by
agasias
the
stymphalian
a
captain
and
hieronymus
an
eleian
also
a
captain
and
other
seniors
of
the
arcadians
and
they
passed
a
resolution
that
for
the
future
whoever
revived
the
idea
of
breaking
up
the
army
should
be
punished
by
death
and
the
army
it
was
decided
would
now
resume
its
old
position
under
the
command
of
its
former
generals
though
cheirisophus
indeed
had
already
died
under
medical
treatment
for
fever
and
neon
the
asinaean
had
taken
his
place
this
i
take
to
be
the
meaning
of
the
words
which
are
necessarily
ambiguous
since
pharmakon
a
drug
also
means
poison
did
cheirisophus
conceivably
die
of
fever
brought
on
by
some
poisonous
draught
or
did
he
take
poison
whilst
suffering
from
fever
or
did
he
die
under
treatment
after
these
resolutions
xenophon
got
up
and
said
soldiers
the
journey
must
now
i
presume
be
conducted
on
foot
indeed
this
is
clear
since
we
have
no
vessels
and
we
are
driven
to
commence
it
at
once
for
we
have
no
provisions
if
we
stop
we
then
he
continued
will
sacrifice
and
you
must
prepare
yourselves
to
fight
now
if
ever
for
the
spirit
of
the
enemy
has
revived
thereupon
the
generals
sacrificed
in
the
presence
of
the
arcadian
seer
arexion
for
silanus
the
ambraciot
had
chartered
a
vessel
at
heraclea
and
made
his
escape
ere
this
sacrificing
with
a
view
to
departure
the
victims
proved
unfavourable
to
them
accordingly
they
waited
that
day
certain
people
were
bold
enough
to
say
that
xenophon
out
of
his
desire
to
colonise
the
place
had
persuaded
the
seer
to
say
that
the
victims
were
unfavourable
to
departure
consequently
he
proclaimed
by
herald
next
morning
that
any
one
who
liked
should
be
present
at
the
sacrifice
or
if
he
were
a
seer
he
was
bidden
to
be
present
and
help
to
inspect
the
victims
then
he
sacrificed
and
there
were
numbers
present
but
though
the
sacrifice
on
the
question
of
departure
was
repeated
as
many
as
three
times
the
victims
were
persistently
unfavourable
thereat
the
soldiers
were
in
high
dudgeon
for
the
provisions
they
had
brought
with
them
had
reached
the
lowest
ebb
and
there
was
no
market
to
be
had
consequently
there
was
another
meeting
and
xenophon
spoke
again
men
said
he
the
victims
are
as
you
may
see
for
yourselves
not
yet
favourable
to
the
march
but
meanwhile
i
can
see
for
myself
that
you
are
in
need
of
provisions
accordingly
we
must
narrow
the
sacrifice
to
the
particular
point
some
one
got
up
and
said
naturally
enough
the
victims
are
unfavourable
for
as
i
learnt
from
some
one
on
a
vessel
which
arrived
here
yesterday
by
accident
cleander
the
governor
at
byzantium
intends
coming
here
with
ships
and
thereat
they
were
all
in
favour
of
stopping
but
they
must
needs
go
out
for
provisions
and
with
this
object
he
again
sacrificed
three
times
and
the
victims
remained
adverse
things
had
now
reached
such
a
pass
that
the
men
actually
came
to
xenophon
tent
to
proclaim
that
they
had
no
provisions
his
sole
answer
was
that
he
would
not
lead
them
out
till
the
victims
were
favourable
so
again
the
next
day
he
sacrificed
and
nearly
the
whole
army
so
strong
was
the
general
anxiety
flocked
round
the
victims
and
now
the
very
victims
themselves
failed
so
the
generals
instead
of
leading
out
the
army
called
the
men
together
xenophon
as
was
incumbent
on
him
spoke
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
enemy
are
collected
in
a
body
and
we
shall
have
to
fight
if
we
were
to
leave
our
baggage
in
the
strong
place
pointing
overhead
and
sally
forth
prepared
for
battle
the
victims
might
favour
us
but
the
soldiers
on
hearing
this
proposal
cried
out
no
need
to
take
us
inside
that
place
better
sacrifice
with
all
speed
now
sheep
there
were
none
any
longer
so
they
purchased
oxen
from
under
a
wagon
and
sacrificed
and
xenophon
begged
cleanor
the
arcadian
to
superintend
the
sacrifice
on
his
behalf
in
case
there
might
be
some
change
now
but
even
so
there
was
no
improvement
now
neon
was
general
in
place
of
cheirisophus
and
seeing
the
men
suffering
so
cruelly
from
want
he
was
willing
to
do
them
a
good
turn
so
he
got
hold
of
some
heracleot
or
other
who
said
he
knew
of
villages
close
by
from
which
they
could
get
provisions
and
proclaimed
by
herald
if
any
one
liked
to
come
out
and
get
provisions
be
it
known
that
he
neon
would
be
their
leader
so
out
came
the
men
with
spears
and
wine
skins
and
sacks
and
other
vessels
two
thousand
strong
in
all
but
when
they
had
reached
the
villages
and
began
to
scatter
for
the
purpose
of
foraging
pharnabazus
cavalry
were
the
first
to
fall
upon
them
they
had
come
to
the
aid
of
the
bithynians
wishing
if
possible
in
conjunction
with
the
latter
to
hinder
the
hellenes
from
entering
phrygia
these
troopers
killed
no
less
than
five
hundred
of
the
men
the
rest
fled
for
the
lives
up
into
the
hill
country
news
of
the
catastrophe
was
presently
brought
into
camp
by
one
of
those
who
had
escaped
and
xenophon
seeing
that
the
victims
had
not
been
favourable
on
that
day
took
a
wagon
bullock
in
the
absence
of
other
sacrificial
beasts
offered
it
up
and
started
for
the
rescue
he
and
the
rest
under
thirty
years
of
age
to
the
last
man
thus
they
picked
up
the
remnant
of
neon
party
and
returned
to
camp
it
was
now
about
sunset
and
the
hellenes
in
deep
despondency
were
making
their
evening
meal
when
all
of
a
sudden
through
bush
and
brake
a
party
of
bithynians
fell
upon
the
pickets
cutting
down
some
and
chasing
the
rest
into
camp
in
the
midst
of
screams
and
shouts
the
hellenes
ran
to
their
arms
one
and
all
yet
to
pursue
or
move
the
camp
in
the
night
seemed
hardly
safe
for
the
ground
was
thickly
grown
with
bush
all
they
could
do
was
to
strengthen
the
outposts
and
keep
watch
under
arms
the
livelong
night
v
and
so
they
spent
the
night
but
with
the
generals
led
the
way
into
the
natural
fastness
and
the
others
picked
up
their
arms
and
baggage
and
followed
the
lead
before
the
arrived
they
had
fenced
off
with
a
ditch
the
only
side
on
which
lay
ingress
into
the
place
and
had
palisaded
off
the
whole
leaving
only
three
gates
anon
a
ship
from
heraclea
arrived
bringing
barleymeal
victim
animals
and
wine
xenophon
was
up
betimes
and
made
the
usual
offering
before
starting
on
an
expedition
and
at
the
first
victim
the
sacrifice
was
favourable
just
as
the
sacrifice
ended
the
seer
arexion
the
parrhasian
caught
sight
of
an
eagle
which
boded
well
and
bade
xenophon
lead
on
so
they
crossed
the
trench
and
grounded
arms
then
proclamation
was
made
by
herald
for
the
soldiers
to
breakfast
and
start
on
an
expedition
under
arms
the
mob
of
sutlers
and
the
captured
slaves
would
be
left
in
camp
accordingly
the
mass
of
the
troops
set
out
neon
alone
remained
for
it
seemed
best
to
leave
that
general
and
his
men
to
guard
the
contents
of
the
camp
but
when
the
officers
and
soldiers
had
left
them
in
the
lurch
they
were
so
ashamed
to
stop
in
camp
while
the
rest
marched
out
that
they
too
set
out
leaving
only
those
above
years
of
age
these
then
stayed
while
the
rest
set
out
on
the
march
before
they
had
gone
two
miles
they
stumbled
upon
dead
bodies
and
when
they
had
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
column
in
a
line
with
the
first
bodies
to
be
seen
they
began
digging
graves
and
burying
all
included
in
the
column
from
end
to
end
after
burying
the
first
batch
they
advanced
and
again
bringing
the
rear
even
with
the
first
unburied
bodies
which
appeared
they
buried
in
the
same
way
all
which
the
line
of
troops
included
finally
reaching
the
road
that
led
out
of
the
villages
where
the
bodies
lay
thick
together
they
collected
them
and
laid
them
in
a
common
grave
it
was
now
about
midday
when
pushing
forward
the
troops
up
to
the
villages
without
entering
them
they
proceeded
to
seize
provisions
laying
hands
on
everything
they
could
set
eyes
on
under
cover
of
their
lines
when
suddenly
they
caught
sight
of
the
enemy
cresting
certain
hillocks
in
front
of
them
duly
marshalled
in
line
a
large
body
of
cavalry
and
infantry
it
was
spithridates
and
rhathines
sent
by
pharnabazus
with
their
force
at
their
backs
as
soon
as
the
enemy
caught
sight
of
the
hellenes
they
stood
still
about
two
miles
distant
then
arexion
the
seer
sacrificed
and
at
the
first
essay
the
victims
were
favourable
whereupon
xenophon
addressed
the
other
generals
i
would
advise
sirs
that
we
should
detach
one
or
more
flying
columns
to
support
our
main
attack
so
that
in
case
of
need
at
any
point
we
may
have
reserves
in
readiness
to
assist
our
main
body
and
the
enemy
in
the
confusion
of
battle
may
find
himself
attacking
the
unbroken
lines
of
troops
not
hitherto
engaged
these
views
approved
themselves
to
all
do
you
then
said
he
lead
on
the
vanguard
straight
at
the
enemy
do
not
let
us
stand
parleying
here
now
that
we
have
caught
sight
of
him
and
he
of
us
i
will
detach
the
hindmost
companies
in
the
way
we
have
decided
upon
and
follow
you
after
that
they
quietly
advanced
and
he
withdrawing
the
companies
in
three
brigades
consisting
of
a
couple
of
hundred
men
apiece
commissioned
the
first
on
the
right
to
follow
the
main
body
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
feet
samolas
the
achaean
was
in
command
of
this
brigade
the
duty
of
the
second
under
the
command
of
pyrrhias
the
arcadian
was
to
follow
in
the
centre
the
last
was
posted
on
the
left
with
phrasias
an
athenian
in
command
as
they
advanced
the
vanguard
reached
a
large
and
difficult
woody
glen
and
halted
not
knowing
whether
the
obstacle
needed
to
be
crossed
or
not
they
passed
down
the
word
for
the
generals
and
officers
to
come
forward
to
the
front
xenophon
wondering
what
it
was
that
stopped
the
march
and
presently
hearing
the
above
order
passed
along
the
ranks
rode
up
with
all
speed
as
soon
as
they
were
met
sophaenetus
as
the
eldest
general
stated
his
opinion
that
the
question
whether
a
gully
of
that
kind
ought
to
be
crossed
or
not
was
not
worth
discussing
xenophon
with
some
ardour
retorted
you
know
sirs
i
have
not
been
in
the
habit
hitherto
of
introducing
you
to
danger
which
you
might
avoid
it
is
not
your
reputation
for
courage
surely
that
is
at
stake
but
your
safe
return
home
but
now
the
matter
stands
thus
it
is
impossible
to
retire
from
this
point
without
a
battle
if
we
do
not
advance
against
the
enemy
ourselves
he
will
follow
us
as
soon
as
we
have
turned
our
backs
and
attack
us
consider
then
is
it
better
to
go
and
meet
the
foe
with
arms
advanced
or
with
arms
reversed
to
watch
him
as
he
assails
us
on
our
rear
you
know
this
at
any
rate
that
to
retire
before
an
enemy
has
nothing
glorious
about
it
whereas
attack
engenders
courage
even
in
a
coward
for
my
part
i
would
rather
at
any
time
attack
with
half
my
men
than
retreat
with
twice
the
number
as
to
these
fellows
if
we
attack
them
i
am
sure
you
do
not
really
expect
them
to
await
us
though
if
we
retreat
we
know
for
certain
they
will
be
emboldened
to
pursue
us
nay
if
the
result
of
crossing
is
to
place
a
difficult
gully
behind
us
when
we
are
on
the
point
of
engaging
surely
that
is
an
advantage
worth
seizing
at
least
if
it
were
left
to
me
i
would
choose
that
everything
should
appear
smooth
and
passable
to
the
enemy
which
may
invite
retreat
but
for
ourselves
we
may
bless
the
ground
which
teaches
us
that
except
in
victory
we
have
no
deliverance
it
astonishes
me
that
any
one
should
deem
this
particular
gully
a
whit
more
terrible
than
any
of
the
other
barriers
which
we
have
successfully
passed
how
impassable
was
the
plain
had
we
failed
to
conquer
their
cavalry
how
insurmountable
the
mountains
already
traversed
by
us
with
all
their
peltasts
in
hot
pursuit
at
our
heels
nay
when
we
have
safely
reached
the
sea
the
pontus
will
present
a
somewhat
formidable
gully
when
we
have
neither
vessels
to
convey
us
away
nor
corn
to
keep
us
alive
whilst
we
stop
but
we
shall
no
sooner
be
there
than
we
must
be
off
again
to
get
provisions
surely
it
is
better
to
fight
after
a
good
breakfast
than
on
an
empty
stomach
sirs
the
offerings
are
favourable
to
us
the
omens
are
propitious
the
victims
more
than
promising
let
us
attack
the
enemy
now
that
they
have
had
a
good
look
at
us
these
fellows
must
not
be
allowed
to
enjoy
their
dinners
or
choose
a
camp
at
their
own
sweet
will
after
that
the
officers
bade
him
lead
on
none
gainsaid
and
he
led
the
way
his
orders
were
to
cross
the
gully
where
each
man
chanced
to
find
himself
by
this
method
as
it
seemed
to
him
the
troops
would
more
quickly
mass
themselves
on
the
far
side
than
was
possible
if
they
defiled
along
the
bridge
which
spanned
the
gully
but
once
across
he
passed
along
the
line
and
addressed
the
troops
sirs
call
to
mind
what
by
help
of
the
gods
you
have
already
done
bethink
you
of
the
battles
you
have
won
at
close
quarters
with
the
foe
of
the
fate
which
awaits
those
who
flee
before
their
foes
forget
not
that
we
stand
at
the
very
doors
of
hellas
follow
in
the
steps
of
heracles
our
guide
and
cheer
each
the
other
onwards
by
name
sweet
were
it
surely
by
some
brave
and
noble
word
or
deed
spoken
or
done
this
day
to
leave
the
memory
of
oneself
in
the
hearts
of
those
one
loves
lit
had
they
wound
off
thread
by
thread
the
metaphor
is
from
unwinding
a
ball
of
wool
these
words
were
spoken
as
he
rode
past
and
simultaneously
he
began
leading
on
the
troops
in
battle
line
and
placing
the
peltasts
on
either
flank
of
the
main
body
they
moved
against
the
enemy
along
the
line
the
order
had
sped
to
keep
their
spears
at
rest
on
the
right
shoulder
until
the
bugle
signal
then
lower
them
for
the
charge
slow
march
and
even
pace
no
one
to
quicken
into
a
run
lastly
the
watchword
was
passed
zeus
the
saviour
heracles
our
guide
the
enemy
waited
their
approach
confident
in
the
excellence
of
his
position
but
as
they
drew
closer
the
hellene
light
troops
with
a
loud
alala
without
waiting
for
the
order
dashed
against
the
foe
the
latter
on
their
side
came
forward
eagerly
to
meet
the
charge
both
the
cavalry
and
the
mass
of
the
bithynians
and
these
turned
the
peltasts
but
when
with
the
phalanx
of
the
heavy
infantry
rapidly
advancing
faced
them
and
at
the
same
time
the
bugle
sounded
and
the
battle
hymn
rose
from
all
lips
and
after
this
a
loud
cheer
rose
and
at
the
same
instant
they
couched
their
spears
at
this
conjuncture
the
enemy
no
longer
welcomed
them
but
fled
timasion
with
his
cavalry
followed
close
and
considering
their
scant
numbers
they
did
great
execution
it
was
the
left
wing
of
the
enemy
in
a
line
with
which
the
hellene
cavalry
were
posted
that
was
so
speedily
scattered
but
the
right
which
was
not
so
hotly
pursued
collected
upon
a
knoll
and
when
the
hellenes
saw
them
standing
firm
it
seemed
the
easiest
and
least
dangerous
course
to
go
against
them
at
once
raising
the
battle
hymn
they
straightway
fell
upon
them
but
the
others
did
not
await
their
coming
thereupon
the
peltasts
gave
chase
until
the
right
of
the
enemy
was
in
its
turn
scattered
though
with
slight
loss
in
killed
for
the
enemy
cavalry
was
numerous
and
threatening
but
when
the
hellenes
saw
the
cavalry
of
pharnabazus
still
standing
in
compact
order
and
the
bithynian
horsemen
massing
together
as
if
to
join
it
and
like
spectators
gazing
down
from
a
knoll
at
the
occurrences
below
though
weary
they
determined
to
attack
the
enemy
as
best
they
could
and
not
suffer
him
to
recover
breath
with
reviving
courage
so
they
formed
in
compact
line
and
advanced
thereupon
the
hostile
cavalry
turned
and
fled
down
the
steep
as
swiftly
as
if
they
had
been
pursued
by
cavalry
in
fact
they
sought
the
shelter
of
a
gully
the
existence
of
which
was
unknown
to
the
hellenes
the
latter
accordingly
turned
aside
too
soon
and
gave
up
the
chase
for
it
was
too
late
returning
to
the
point
where
the
first
encounter
took
place
they
erected
a
trophy
and
went
back
to
the
sea
about
sunset
it
was
something
like
seven
miles
to
camp
vi
after
this
the
enemy
confined
themselves
to
their
own
concerns
and
removed
their
households
and
property
as
far
away
as
possible
the
hellenes
on
their
side
were
still
awaiting
the
arrival
of
cleander
with
the
ships
of
war
and
transports
which
ought
to
be
there
soon
so
each
day
they
went
out
with
the
baggage
animals
and
slaves
and
fearlessly
brought
in
wheat
and
barley
wine
and
vegetables
millet
and
figs
since
the
district
produced
all
good
things
the
olive
alone
excepted
when
the
army
stayed
in
camp
to
rest
pillaging
parties
were
allowed
to
go
out
and
those
who
went
out
appropriated
the
spoils
but
when
the
whole
army
went
out
if
any
one
went
off
apart
and
seized
anything
it
was
voted
to
be
public
property
ere
long
there
was
an
ample
abundance
of
supplies
of
all
sorts
for
marketables
arrived
from
hellenic
cities
on
all
sides
and
marts
were
established
mariners
coasting
by
and
hearing
that
a
city
was
being
founded
and
that
there
was
a
harbour
were
glad
to
put
in
even
the
hostile
tribes
dwelling
in
the
neighbourhood
presently
began
to
send
envoys
to
xenophon
it
was
he
who
was
forming
the
place
into
a
city
as
they
understood
and
they
would
be
glad
to
learn
on
what
terms
they
might
secure
his
friendship
he
made
a
point
of
introducing
these
visitors
to
the
soldiers
meanwhile
cleander
arrived
with
two
ships
of
war
but
not
a
single
transport
at
the
moment
of
his
arrival
as
it
happened
the
army
had
taken
the
field
and
a
separate
party
had
gone
off
on
a
pillaging
expedition
into
the
hills
and
had
captured
a
number
of
small
cattle
in
thir
apprehension
of
being
deprived
of
them
these
same
people
spoke
to
dexippus
this
was
the
same
man
who
had
made
off
from
trapezus
with
the
galley
and
urged
him
to
save
their
sheep
for
them
take
some
for
yourself
said
they
and
give
the
rest
back
to
us
so
without
more
ado
he
drove
off
the
soldiers
standing
near
who
kept
repeating
that
the
spoil
was
public
property
then
off
he
went
to
cleander
here
is
an
attempt
said
he
at
robbery
cleander
bade
him
to
bring
up
the
culprit
to
him
dexippus
seized
on
some
one
and
was
for
haling
him
to
the
spartan
governor
just
then
agasias
came
across
him
and
rescued
the
man
who
was
a
member
of
his
company
and
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
present
set
to
work
to
stone
dexippus
calling
him
traitor
things
looked
so
ill
that
a
number
of
the
crew
of
the
ships
of
war
took
fright
and
fled
to
the
sea
and
with
the
rest
cleander
himself
xenophon
and
the
other
generals
tried
to
hold
the
men
back
assuring
cleander
that
the
affair
signified
nothing
at
all
and
that
the
origin
of
it
was
a
decree
pased
by
the
army
that
was
to
blame
if
anything
but
cleander
goaded
by
dexippus
and
personally
annoyed
at
the
fright
which
he
had
experienced
threatened
to
sail
away
and
publish
an
interdict
against
them
forbidding
any
city
to
receive
them
as
being
public
enemies
for
at
this
date
the
lacedaemonians
held
sway
over
the
whole
hellenic
world
thereat
the
affair
began
to
wear
an
ugly
look
and
the
hellenes
begged
and
implored
cleander
to
reconsider
his
intention
he
replied
that
he
would
be
as
good
as
his
word
and
that
nothing
should
stop
him
unless
the
man
who
set
the
example
of
stoning
with
the
other
who
rescued
the
prisoner
were
given
up
to
him
now
one
of
the
two
whose
persons
were
thus
demanded
agasias
had
been
a
friend
to
xenophon
throughout
and
that
was
just
why
dexippus
was
all
the
more
anxious
to
accuse
him
in
their
perplexity
the
generals
summoned
a
full
meeting
of
the
soldiers
and
some
speakers
were
disposed
to
make
very
light
of
cleander
and
set
him
at
naught
but
xenophon
took
a
more
serious
view
of
the
matter
he
rose
and
addressed
the
meeting
thus
soldiers
i
can
not
say
that
i
feel
disposed
to
make
light
of
this
business
if
cleander
be
allowed
to
go
away
as
he
threatens
to
do
in
his
present
temper
towards
us
there
are
hellenic
cities
close
by
but
then
the
lacedaemonians
are
the
lords
of
hellas
and
they
can
any
one
of
them
carry
out
whatever
they
like
in
the
cities
if
then
the
first
thing
this
lacedaemonian
does
is
to
close
the
gates
of
byzantium
and
next
to
pass
an
order
to
the
other
governors
city
by
city
not
to
receive
us
because
we
are
a
set
of
lawless
ruffians
disloyal
to
the
lacedaemonians
and
if
further
this
report
of
us
should
reach
the
ears
of
their
admiral
anaxibius
to
stay
or
to
sail
away
will
alike
be
difficult
remember
the
lacedaemonians
at
the
present
time
are
lords
alike
on
land
and
on
sea
for
the
sake
then
of
a
single
man
or
for
two
men
sake
it
is
not
right
that
the
rest
of
us
should
be
debarred
from
hellas
but
whatever
they
enjoin
we
must
obey
do
not
the
cities
which
gave
us
birth
yield
them
obedience
also
for
my
own
part
inasmuch
as
dexippus
i
believe
keeps
telling
cleander
that
agasias
would
never
have
done
this
had
not
i
xenophon
bidden
him
i
absolve
you
of
all
complicity
and
agasias
too
if
agasias
himself
states
that
i
am
in
any
way
a
prime
mover
in
this
matter
if
i
have
set
the
fashion
of
or
any
other
sort
of
violence
i
condemn
myself
i
say
that
i
deserve
the
extreme
penalty
and
i
will
submit
to
undergo
it
i
further
say
that
if
any
one
else
is
accused
that
man
is
bound
to
surrender
himself
to
cleander
for
judgement
for
by
this
means
you
will
be
absolved
entirely
from
the
accusation
but
as
the
matter
now
stands
it
is
cruel
that
just
when
we
were
aspiring
to
win
praise
and
honour
throughout
hellas
we
are
destined
to
sink
below
the
level
of
the
rest
of
the
world
banned
from
the
hellenic
cities
whose
common
name
we
boast
after
him
agasias
got
up
and
said
i
swear
to
you
sirs
by
the
gods
and
goddesses
verily
and
indeed
neither
xenophon
nor
any
one
else
among
you
bade
me
rescue
the
man
i
saw
an
honest
man
one
of
my
own
company
being
taken
up
by
dexippus
the
man
who
betrayed
you
as
you
know
full
well
that
i
could
not
endure
i
rescued
him
i
admit
the
fact
do
not
you
deliver
me
up
i
will
surrender
myself
as
xenophon
suggests
to
cleander
to
pass
what
verdict
on
me
he
thinks
right
do
not
for
the
sake
of
such
a
matter
make
foes
of
the
lacedaemonians
rather
god
grant
that
each
of
you
may
safely
reach
the
goal
of
his
desire
only
do
you
choose
from
among
yourselves
and
send
with
me
to
cleander
those
who
in
case
of
any
omission
on
my
part
may
by
their
words
and
acts
supply
what
is
lacking
thereupon
the
army
granted
him
to
choose
for
himself
whom
he
would
have
go
with
him
and
to
go
and
he
at
once
chose
the
generals
after
this
they
all
set
off
to
cleander
agasias
and
the
generals
and
the
man
who
had
been
rescued
by
agasias
and
the
generals
spoke
as
follows
the
army
has
sent
us
to
you
cleander
and
this
is
their
bidding
you
have
fault
to
find
with
all
they
say
you
ought
to
pass
sentence
on
all
and
do
with
them
what
seems
best
or
if
the
charge
is
against
one
man
or
two
or
possibly
several
what
they
expect
of
these
people
is
to
surrender
themselves
to
you
for
judgement
accordingly
if
you
lay
anything
to
the
charge
of
us
generals
here
we
stand
at
your
bar
or
do
you
impute
the
fault
to
some
one
not
here
tell
us
whom
short
of
flying
in
the
face
of
our
authority
there
is
no
one
who
will
absent
himself
reading
with
the
best
sozoisthe
agasias
ends
his
sentence
with
a
prayer
al
sozesthe
act
so
that
each
etc
at
this
point
agasias
stepped
forward
and
said
it
was
i
cleander
who
rescued
the
man
before
you
yonder
from
dexippus
when
the
latter
was
carrying
him
off
and
it
was
i
who
gave
the
order
to
strike
dexippus
my
plea
is
that
i
know
the
prisoner
to
be
an
honest
man
as
to
dexippus
i
know
that
he
was
chosen
by
the
army
to
command
a
galley
which
we
had
obtained
by
request
from
the
men
of
trapezus
for
the
express
purpose
of
collecting
vessels
to
carry
us
safely
home
but
this
same
dexippus
betrayed
his
with
whom
he
had
been
delivered
from
so
many
perils
and
made
off
into
hiding
like
a
runaway
slave
whereby
we
have
robbed
the
trapezuntines
of
their
frigate
and
must
needs
appear
as
knaves
in
their
eyes
for
this
man
sake
as
to
ourselves
as
far
as
he
could
he
has
ruined
us
for
like
the
rest
of
us
he
had
heard
how
all
but
impossible
it
was
for
us
to
retreat
by
foot
across
the
rivers
and
to
reach
hellas
in
safety
that
is
the
stamp
of
man
whom
i
robbed
of
his
prey
now
had
it
been
you
yourself
who
carried
him
off
or
one
of
your
emissaries
or
indeed
any
one
short
of
a
runaway
from
ourselves
be
sure
that
i
should
have
acted
far
otherwise
be
assured
that
if
you
put
me
to
death
at
this
time
you
are
sacrificing
a
good
honest
man
for
the
sake
of
a
coward
and
a
scamp
when
he
had
listened
to
these
remarks
cleander
replied
that
if
such
had
been
the
conduct
of
dexippus
he
could
not
congratulate
him
but
still
he
added
turning
to
the
generals
were
dexippus
ever
so
great
a
scamp
he
ought
not
to
suffer
violence
but
in
the
language
of
your
own
demand
he
was
entitled
to
a
fair
trial
and
so
to
obtain
his
deserts
what
i
have
to
say
at
present
therefore
is
leave
your
friend
here
and
go
your
way
and
when
i
give
the
order
be
present
at
the
trial
i
have
no
further
charge
against
the
army
or
any
one
since
the
prisoner
himself
admits
that
he
rescued
the
man
then
the
man
who
had
been
rescued
said
in
behalf
of
myself
cleander
if
possibly
you
think
that
i
was
being
taken
up
for
some
misdeed
it
is
not
so
i
neither
struck
nor
shot
i
merely
said
sheep
are
public
property
for
it
was
a
resolution
of
the
soldiers
that
whenever
the
army
went
out
as
a
body
any
booty
privately
obtained
was
to
be
public
property
that
was
all
i
said
and
thereupon
yonder
fellow
seized
me
and
began
dragging
me
off
he
wanted
to
stop
our
mouths
so
that
he
might
have
a
share
of
the
things
himself
and
keep
the
rest
for
these
buccaneers
contrary
to
the
ordinance
in
answer
to
that
cleander
said
very
well
if
that
is
your
disposition
you
can
stay
behind
too
and
we
will
take
your
case
into
consideration
also
thereupon
cleander
and
his
party
proceeded
to
breakfast
but
xenophon
collected
the
army
in
assembly
and
advised
their
sending
a
deputation
to
cleander
to
intercede
in
behalf
of
the
men
accordingly
it
was
resolved
to
send
some
generals
and
officers
with
dracontius
the
spartan
and
of
the
rest
those
who
seemed
best
fitted
to
go
the
deputation
was
to
request
cleander
by
all
means
to
release
the
two
men
accordingly
xenophon
came
and
addressed
him
thus
cleander
you
have
the
men
the
army
has
bowed
to
you
and
assented
to
do
what
you
wished
with
respect
to
these
two
members
of
their
body
and
themselves
in
general
but
now
they
beg
and
pray
you
to
give
up
these
two
men
and
not
to
put
them
to
death
many
a
good
service
have
these
two
wrought
for
our
army
in
past
days
let
them
but
obtain
this
from
you
and
in
return
the
army
promises
that
if
you
will
put
yourself
at
their
head
and
the
gracious
gods
approve
they
will
show
you
how
orderly
they
are
how
apt
to
obey
their
general
and
with
help
to
face
their
foes
unflinchingly
they
make
this
further
request
to
you
that
you
will
present
yourself
and
take
command
of
them
and
make
trial
of
them
us
ourselves
they
say
test
dexippus
what
each
of
us
is
like
and
afterwards
assign
to
each
his
due
when
cleander
heard
these
things
he
answered
nay
by
the
twin
gods
i
will
answer
you
quickly
enough
here
i
make
you
a
present
of
the
two
men
and
i
will
as
you
say
present
myself
and
then
if
the
gods
vouchsafe
i
will
put
myself
at
your
head
and
lead
you
into
hellas
very
different
is
your
language
from
the
tale
i
used
to
hear
concerning
you
from
certain
people
that
you
wanted
to
withdraw
the
army
from
allegiance
to
the
lacedaemonians
after
this
the
deputation
thanked
him
and
retired
taking
with
them
the
two
men
then
cleander
sacrificed
as
a
preliminary
to
marching
and
consorted
friendlily
with
xenophon
and
the
two
struck
up
an
alliance
when
the
spartan
saw
with
what
good
discipline
the
men
carried
out
their
orders
he
was
still
more
anxious
to
become
their
leader
however
in
spite
of
sacrifices
repeated
on
three
successive
days
the
victims
steadily
remained
unfavourable
so
he
summoned
the
generals
and
said
to
them
the
victims
smile
not
on
me
they
suffer
me
not
to
lead
you
home
but
be
not
out
of
heart
at
that
to
you
it
is
given
as
it
would
appear
to
bring
your
men
safe
home
forwards
then
and
for
our
part
whenever
you
come
yonder
we
will
bestow
on
you
as
warm
a
welcome
as
we
may
then
the
soldiers
resolved
to
make
him
a
present
of
the
public
cattle
which
he
accepted
but
again
gave
back
to
them
so
he
sailed
away
but
the
soldiers
made
division
of
the
corn
which
they
had
collected
and
of
the
other
captured
property
and
commenced
their
homeward
march
through
the
territory
of
the
bithynians
at
first
they
confined
themselves
to
the
main
road
but
not
chancing
upon
anything
whereby
they
might
reach
a
friendly
territory
with
something
in
their
pockets
for
themselves
they
resolved
to
turn
sharp
round
and
marched
for
one
day
and
night
in
the
opposite
direction
by
this
proceeding
they
captured
many
slaves
and
much
small
cattle
and
on
the
sixth
day
reached
chrysopolis
in
chalcedonia
here
they
halted
seven
days
while
they
disposed
of
their
booty
by
sale
the
name
should
be
written
calchedonia
the
false
form
drove
out
the
more
correct
probably
through
a
mispronunciation
based
on
a
wrong
derivation
at
some
date
long
ago
the
sites
of
chrysopolis
and
calchedon
correspond
respectively
to
the
modern
scutari
and
kadikoi
book
vii
in
the
earlier
portion
of
the
narrative
will
be
found
a
detailed
history
of
the
fortunes
of
the
hellenes
during
their
march
up
country
with
cyrus
down
to
the
date
of
the
battle
and
subsequently
to
his
death
until
they
reached
the
euxine
as
also
of
all
their
doings
in
their
efforts
to
escape
from
the
euxine
partly
by
land
marches
and
partly
under
sail
by
sea
until
they
found
themselves
outside
the
mouth
of
the
black
sea
south
of
the
bosphorus
at
chrysopolis
in
asia
i
at
this
point
pharnabazus
who
was
afraid
that
the
army
might
undertake
a
campaign
against
his
satrapy
sent
to
anaxibius
the
spartan
high
admiral
who
chanced
to
be
in
byzantium
and
begged
him
to
convey
the
army
out
of
asia
undertaking
to
comply
with
his
wishes
in
every
respect
anaxibius
accordingly
sent
to
summon
the
generals
and
officers
to
byzantium
and
promised
that
the
soldiers
should
not
lack
pay
for
service
if
they
crossed
the
strait
the
officers
said
that
they
would
deliberate
and
return
an
answer
xenophon
individually
informed
them
that
he
was
about
to
quit
the
army
at
once
and
was
only
anxious
to
set
sail
anaxibius
pressed
him
not
to
be
in
so
great
a
hurry
cross
over
with
the
rest
he
said
and
then
it
will
be
time
enough
to
think
about
quitting
the
army
this
the
other
undertook
to
do
now
seuthes
the
thracian
sent
medosades
and
begged
xenophon
to
use
his
influence
to
get
the
army
across
tell
xenophon
if
he
will
do
his
best
for
me
in
this
matter
he
will
not
regret
it
xenophon
answered
the
army
is
in
any
case
going
to
cross
so
that
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
seuthes
is
under
no
obligation
to
me
or
to
any
one
else
but
as
soon
as
it
is
once
across
i
personally
shall
be
quit
of
it
let
seuthes
therefore
as
far
as
he
may
deem
consistent
with
prudence
apply
to
those
who
are
going
to
remain
and
will
have
a
voice
in
affairs
after
this
the
whole
body
of
troops
crossed
to
byzantium
but
anaxibius
instead
of
proceeding
to
give
pay
made
proclamation
that
the
soldiers
were
to
take
up
their
arms
and
baggage
and
go
forth
as
if
all
he
wished
were
to
ascertain
their
numbers
and
bid
them
at
the
same
moment
the
soldiers
were
not
well
pleased
at
that
because
they
had
no
money
to
furnish
themselves
with
provisions
for
the
march
and
they
sluggishly
set
about
getting
their
baggage
together
xenophon
meanwhile
being
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
the
governor
cleander
came
to
pay
his
host
a
final
visit
and
bid
him
adieu
being
on
the
point
of
setting
sail
but
the
other
protested
do
not
do
so
or
else
said
he
you
will
be
blamed
for
even
now
certain
people
are
disposed
to
hold
you
to
account
because
the
army
is
so
slow
in
getting
under
weigh
the
other
answered
nay
i
am
not
to
blame
for
that
it
is
the
men
themselves
who
are
in
want
of
provisions
that
is
why
they
are
out
of
heart
at
their
exodus
all
the
same
he
replied
i
advise
you
to
go
out
as
if
you
intended
to
march
with
them
and
when
you
are
well
outside
it
will
be
time
enough
to
take
yourself
off
well
then
said
xenophon
we
will
go
and
arrange
all
this
with
anaxibius
they
went
and
stated
the
case
to
the
admiral
who
insisted
that
they
must
do
as
he
had
said
and
march
out
bag
and
baggage
by
the
quickest
road
and
as
an
appendix
to
the
former
edict
he
added
any
one
absenting
himself
from
the
review
and
the
muster
will
have
himself
to
blame
for
the
consequences
this
was
peremptory
so
out
marched
the
generals
first
and
then
the
rest
and
now
with
the
exception
of
here
a
man
and
there
they
were
all
outside
it
was
a
clean
sweep
and
eteonicus
stood
posted
near
the
gates
ready
to
close
them
as
soon
as
the
men
were
fairly
out
and
to
thrust
in
the
bolt
pin
then
anaxibius
summoned
the
generals
and
captains
and
addressed
them
provisions
you
had
better
get
from
the
thracian
villages
you
will
find
plenty
of
barley
wheat
and
other
necessaries
in
them
and
when
you
have
got
them
off
with
you
to
the
chersonese
where
cyniscus
will
take
you
into
his
service
some
of
the
soldiers
overheard
what
was
said
or
possibly
one
of
the
officers
was
the
medium
of
communication
however
it
was
the
news
was
handed
on
to
the
army
as
to
the
generals
their
immediate
concern
was
to
try
and
gain
some
information
as
to
seuthes
was
he
hostile
or
friendly
also
would
they
have
to
march
through
the
sacred
mountain
or
round
about
through
the
middle
of
thrace
so
the
is
named
which
runs
parallel
to
the
propontis
sea
of
marmora
from
lat
degrees
circa
to
lat
degrees
from
bisanthe
rhodosto
to
the
neck
of
the
chersonese
gallipoli
while
they
were
discussing
these
points
the
soldiers
snatched
up
their
arms
and
made
a
rush
full
speed
at
the
gates
with
the
intention
of
getting
inside
the
fortification
again
but
eteonicus
and
his
men
seeing
the
heavy
infantry
coming
up
at
a
run
promptly
closed
the
gates
and
thrust
in
the
bolt
pin
then
the
soldiers
fell
to
battering
the
gates
exclaiming
that
it
was
iniquitous
to
thrust
them
forth
in
this
fashion
into
the
jaws
of
their
enemies
if
you
do
not
of
your
own
accord
open
the
gates
they
cried
we
will
split
them
in
half
and
another
set
rushed
down
to
the
sea
and
so
along
the
and
over
the
wall
into
the
city
while
a
third
set
consisting
of
those
few
who
were
still
inside
having
never
left
the
city
seeing
the
affair
at
the
gates
severed
the
bars
with
axes
and
flung
the
portals
wide
open
and
the
rest
came
pouring
in
xenophon
seeing
what
was
happening
was
seized
with
alarm
lest
the
army
betake
itself
to
pillage
and
ills
incurable
be
wrought
to
the
city
to
himself
and
to
the
soldiers
then
he
set
off
and
plunging
into
the
throng
was
swept
through
the
gates
with
the
crowd
the
byzantines
no
sooner
saw
the
soldiers
forcibly
rushing
in
than
they
left
the
open
square
and
fled
some
to
the
shipping
others
to
their
homes
while
those
already
indoors
came
racing
out
and
some
fell
to
dragging
down
their
ships
of
war
hoping
possibly
to
be
safe
on
board
these
while
there
was
not
a
soul
who
doubted
but
that
the
city
was
taken
and
that
they
were
all
undone
eteonicus
made
a
swift
retreat
to
the
citadel
anaxibius
ran
down
to
the
sea
and
getting
on
board
a
fisherman
smack
sailed
round
to
the
acropolis
and
at
once
sent
off
to
fetch
over
the
garrison
troops
from
chalcedon
since
those
already
in
the
acropolis
seemed
hardly
sufficient
to
keep
the
men
in
check
the
soldiers
catching
sight
of
xenophon
threw
themselves
upon
him
crying
now
xenophon
is
the
time
to
prove
yourself
a
man
you
have
got
a
city
you
have
got
triremes
you
have
got
money
you
have
got
men
if
you
only
chose
you
can
do
us
a
good
turn
and
we
will
make
you
a
great
man
he
replied
nay
i
like
what
you
say
and
i
will
do
it
all
but
if
that
is
what
you
have
set
your
hearts
on
fall
into
rank
and
take
up
position
at
once
this
he
said
wishing
to
quiet
them
and
so
passed
the
order
along
the
lines
himself
while
bidding
the
rest
to
do
the
same
take
up
position
stand
easy
but
the
men
themselves
by
a
species
of
fell
into
rank
and
were
soon
formed
the
heavy
infantry
eight
deep
while
the
light
infantry
had
run
up
to
cover
either
wing
the
thracian
square
as
it
is
called
is
a
fine
site
for
manouvering
being
bare
of
buildings
and
level
as
soon
as
the
arms
were
stacked
and
the
men
tempers
cooled
xenophon
called
a
general
meeting
of
the
soldiers
and
made
the
following
speech
soldiers
i
am
not
surprised
at
your
wrath
or
that
you
deem
it
monstrous
treatment
so
to
be
cheated
but
consider
what
will
be
the
consequences
if
we
gratify
our
indignation
and
in
return
for
such
deception
avenge
ourselves
on
the
lacedaemonians
here
present
and
plunder
an
innocent
city
we
shall
be
declared
enemies
of
the
lacedaemonians
and
their
allies
and
what
sort
of
war
that
will
be
we
need
not
go
far
to
conjecture
i
take
it
you
have
not
forgotten
some
quite
recent
occurrences
we
athenians
entered
into
war
against
the
lacedaemonians
and
their
allies
with
a
fleet
consisting
of
not
less
than
three
hundred
ships
including
those
in
dock
as
well
as
those
afloat
we
had
vast
treasures
stored
up
in
the
city
and
a
yearly
income
which
derived
from
home
or
foreign
sources
amounted
to
no
less
than
a
thousand
talents
our
empire
included
all
the
islands
and
we
were
possessed
of
numerous
cities
both
in
asia
and
in
europe
amongst
others
this
very
byzantium
where
we
are
now
was
ours
and
yet
in
the
end
we
were
vanquished
as
you
all
very
well
know
what
must
we
anticipate
will
now
be
our
fate
the
lacedaemonians
have
not
only
their
old
allies
but
the
athenians
and
those
who
were
at
that
time
allies
of
athens
are
added
to
them
tissaphernes
and
all
the
rest
of
the
asiatics
on
the
seaboard
are
our
foes
not
to
speak
of
our
the
king
himself
up
yonder
whom
we
came
to
deprive
of
his
empire
and
to
kill
if
possible
i
ask
then
with
all
these
banded
together
against
us
is
there
any
one
so
insensate
as
to
imagine
that
we
can
survive
the
contest
for
heaven
sake
let
us
not
go
mad
or
loosely
throw
away
our
lives
in
war
with
our
own
native
cities
nay
our
own
friends
our
kith
and
our
kin
for
in
one
or
other
of
the
cities
they
are
all
included
every
city
will
march
against
us
and
not
unjustly
if
after
refusing
to
hold
one
single
barbarian
city
by
right
of
conquest
we
seize
the
first
hellenic
city
that
we
come
to
and
make
it
a
ruinous
heap
for
my
part
my
prayer
is
that
before
i
see
such
things
wrought
by
you
i
at
any
rate
may
lie
ten
thousand
fathoms
under
ground
my
counsel
to
you
as
hellenes
is
to
try
and
obtain
your
just
rights
through
obedience
to
those
who
stand
at
the
head
of
hellas
and
if
so
be
that
you
fail
in
those
demands
why
being
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
need
we
rob
ourselves
of
hellas
too
at
present
i
propose
that
we
should
send
to
anaxibius
and
tell
him
that
we
have
made
an
entrance
into
the
city
not
meditating
violence
but
merely
to
discover
if
he
and
his
will
show
us
any
good
for
if
so
it
is
well
but
of
otherwise
at
least
we
will
let
him
see
that
he
does
not
shut
the
door
upon
us
as
dupes
and
fools
we
know
the
meaning
of
discipline
we
turn
our
backs
and
go
this
resolution
was
passed
and
they
sent
hieronymus
an
eleian
with
two
others
eurylochus
an
arcadian
and
philesius
an
achaean
to
deliver
the
message
so
these
set
off
on
their
errand
but
while
the
soldiers
were
still
seated
in
conclave
coeratadas
of
thebes
arrived
he
was
a
theban
not
in
exile
but
with
a
taste
for
generalship
who
made
it
his
business
to
see
if
any
city
or
nation
were
in
need
of
his
services
thus
on
the
present
occasion
he
presented
himself
and
begged
to
state
that
he
was
ready
to
put
himself
at
their
head
and
lead
them
into
the
delta
of
thrace
as
it
is
called
where
they
would
find
themselves
in
a
land
of
plenty
but
until
they
got
there
he
would
provide
them
with
meat
and
drink
enough
and
to
spare
while
they
were
still
listening
to
this
tale
the
return
message
from
anaxibius
came
his
answer
was
the
discipline
they
had
spoken
of
was
not
a
thing
they
would
regret
indeed
he
would
report
their
behaviour
to
the
authorities
at
home
and
for
himself
he
would
take
advice
and
do
the
best
he
could
for
them
the
exact
locality
so
called
is
not
known
doubtless
it
lay
somewhere
between
byzantium
and
salmydessus
possibly
at
declus
mod
derkos
or
possibly
the
narrow
portion
of
thrace
between
the
euxine
bosphorus
and
propontis
went
by
this
name
see
note
in
pretor
ad
and
dict
geog
thracia
thereupon
the
soldiers
accepted
coeratadas
as
their
general
and
retired
without
the
walls
their
new
general
undertook
to
present
himself
to
the
troops
next
day
with
sacrificial
beasts
and
a
soothsayer
with
eatables
also
and
drinkables
for
the
army
now
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
out
anaxibius
closed
the
gates
and
issued
a
proclamation
to
the
effect
that
any
of
the
soldiers
caught
inside
should
be
knocked
down
to
the
hammer
and
sold
at
once
next
day
coeratadas
arrived
with
the
victims
and
the
soothsayer
a
string
of
twenty
bearers
bearing
barleymeal
followed
at
his
heels
succeeded
by
other
twenty
carrying
wine
and
three
laden
with
a
supply
of
olives
and
two
others
carrying
the
one
about
as
much
garlic
as
a
single
man
could
lift
and
the
other
a
similar
load
of
onions
these
various
supplies
he
set
down
apparently
for
distribution
and
began
to
sacrifice
now
xenophon
sent
to
cleander
begging
him
to
arrange
matters
so
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
enter
the
walls
with
a
view
to
starting
from
byzantium
on
his
homeward
voyage
cleander
came
and
this
is
what
he
said
i
have
come
but
i
was
barely
able
to
arrange
what
you
want
anaxibius
insisted
was
not
convenient
that
xenophon
should
be
inside
while
the
soldiers
are
close
to
the
walls
without
the
byzantines
at
sixes
and
sevens
moreover
and
no
love
lost
between
the
one
party
of
them
and
the
other
still
he
ended
by
bidding
you
to
come
inside
if
you
were
really
minded
to
leave
the
town
by
sea
with
himself
accordingly
xenophon
bade
the
soldiers
and
returned
with
cleander
within
the
walls
to
return
to
coeratadas
the
first
day
he
failed
to
get
favourable
signs
at
the
sacrifice
and
never
a
dole
of
rations
did
he
make
to
the
soldiers
on
the
second
day
the
victims
were
standing
ready
near
the
altar
and
so
was
coeratadas
with
chaplet
crowned
all
ready
to
sacrifice
when
up
comes
timasion
the
dardanian
with
neon
the
asinaean
and
cleanor
of
orchomenus
forbidding
coeratadas
to
sacrifice
he
must
understand
there
was
an
end
to
his
generalship
unless
he
gave
them
provisions
the
other
bade
them
measure
out
the
supplies
pray
dole
them
out
but
when
he
found
that
he
had
a
good
deal
short
of
a
single
day
provisions
for
each
man
he
picked
up
his
paraphernalia
of
sacrifice
and
withdrew
as
to
being
general
he
would
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
it
ii
now
these
five
were
left
neon
the
asinaean
phryniscus
the
achaean
philesius
the
achaean
xanthicles
the
achaean
timasion
the
dardanian
at
the
head
of
the
army
and
they
pushed
on
to
some
villages
of
the
thracians
facing
byzantium
and
there
encamped
now
the
generals
could
not
agree
cleanor
and
phryniscus
wished
to
march
to
join
seuthes
who
had
worked
upon
their
feelings
by
presenting
one
with
a
horse
and
the
other
with
a
woman
to
wife
but
neon
object
was
to
come
to
the
chersonese
when
we
are
under
the
wing
of
the
lacedaemonians
he
thought
i
shall
step
to
the
front
and
command
the
whole
army
timasion
one
ambition
was
to
cross
back
again
into
asia
hoping
to
be
reinstated
at
home
and
end
his
exile
the
soldiers
shared
the
wishes
of
the
last
general
but
as
time
dragged
on
many
of
the
men
sold
their
arms
at
different
places
and
set
sail
as
best
they
could
others
actually
gave
away
their
arms
some
here
some
there
and
became
absorbed
in
the
cities
one
man
rejoiced
this
was
anaxibius
to
whom
the
of
the
army
was
a
blessing
that
is
the
way
he
said
to
himself
i
can
best
gratify
pharnabazus
the
mss
give
the
words
so
rendered
oi
de
kai
didontes
ta
opla
kata
tous
khorous
which
some
critics
emend
diadidontes
others
bracket
as
suspected
others
expunge
but
anaxibius
while
prosecuting
his
voyage
from
byzantium
was
met
at
cyzicus
by
aristarchus
the
new
governor
who
was
to
succeed
cleander
at
byzantium
and
report
said
that
a
new
admiral
polus
if
he
had
not
actually
arrived
would
presently
reach
the
hellespont
and
relieve
anaxibius
the
latter
sent
a
parting
injunction
to
aristarchus
to
be
sure
and
sell
all
the
cyreian
soldiers
he
could
lay
hands
on
still
lingering
in
byzantium
for
cleander
had
not
sold
a
single
man
of
them
on
the
contrary
he
had
made
it
his
business
to
tend
the
sick
and
wounded
pitying
them
and
insisting
on
their
being
received
in
the
houses
aristarchus
changed
all
that
and
was
no
sooner
arrived
in
byzantium
than
he
sold
no
less
than
four
hundred
of
them
meanwhile
anaxibius
on
his
coasting
voyage
reached
parium
and
according
to
the
terms
of
their
agreement
he
sent
to
pharnabazus
but
the
latter
learning
that
aristarchus
was
the
new
governor
at
byzantim
and
that
anixibius
had
ceased
to
be
admiral
turned
upon
him
a
cold
shoulder
and
set
out
concocting
the
same
measures
concerning
the
cyreian
army
with
aristarchus
as
he
had
lately
been
at
work
upon
with
anaxibius
anaxibius
thereupon
summoned
xenophon
and
bade
him
by
every
manner
of
means
sail
to
the
army
with
the
utmost
speed
and
keep
it
together
he
was
to
collect
the
scattered
fragments
and
march
them
down
to
perinthus
and
thence
convey
them
across
to
asia
without
loss
of
time
and
herewith
he
put
a
galley
at
his
service
and
gave
him
a
letter
of
authority
and
an
officer
to
accompany
him
with
an
order
to
the
perinthians
to
escort
xenophon
without
delay
on
horseback
to
the
army
so
it
was
that
xenophon
sailed
across
and
eventually
reached
the
army
the
soldiers
gave
him
a
joyous
welcome
and
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
cross
from
thrace
into
asia
under
his
leadership
but
seuthes
hearing
that
xenophon
had
arrived
sent
medosades
again
by
sea
to
meet
him
and
begged
him
to
bring
the
army
to
him
and
whatever
he
thought
would
make
his
speech
persuasive
he
was
ready
to
promise
him
but
the
other
replied
that
none
of
these
things
were
open
to
him
to
do
and
with
this
answer
medosades
departed
and
the
hellenes
proceeded
to
perinthus
here
on
arrival
neon
withdrew
his
troops
and
encamped
apart
having
about
eight
hundred
men
while
the
remainder
of
the
army
lay
in
one
place
under
the
walls
of
perinthus
after
this
xenophon
set
himself
to
find
vessels
so
as
to
lose
no
time
in
crossing
but
in
the
interval
aristarchus
the
governor
from
byzantium
arrived
with
a
couple
of
being
moved
to
do
so
by
pharnabazus
to
make
doubly
sure
he
first
forbade
the
skippers
and
shipmasters
to
carry
the
troops
across
and
then
he
visited
the
camp
and
informed
the
soldiers
that
their
passage
into
asia
was
forbidden
xenophon
replied
that
he
was
acting
under
the
orders
of
anaxibius
who
had
sent
him
thither
for
this
express
purpose
to
which
aristarchus
retorted
for
the
matter
of
that
anaxibius
is
no
longer
admiral
and
i
am
governor
in
this
quarter
if
i
catch
any
of
you
at
sea
i
will
sink
you
with
these
remarks
he
retired
within
the
walls
of
perinthus
next
day
he
sent
for
the
generals
and
officers
of
the
army
they
had
already
reached
the
fortification
walls
when
some
one
brought
word
to
xenophon
that
if
he
set
foot
inside
he
would
be
seized
and
either
meet
some
ill
fate
there
or
more
likely
be
delivered
up
to
pharnabazus
on
hearing
this
xenophon
sent
forward
the
rest
of
the
party
but
for
himself
pleaded
that
there
was
a
sacrifice
which
he
wished
to
offer
in
this
way
he
contrived
to
turn
back
and
consult
the
victims
would
the
gods
allow
him
to
try
and
bring
the
army
over
to
seuthes
on
the
one
hand
it
was
plain
that
the
idea
of
crossing
over
to
asia
in
the
face
of
this
man
with
his
ships
of
war
who
meant
to
bar
the
passage
was
too
dangerous
nor
did
he
altogether
like
the
notion
of
being
blocked
up
in
the
chersonese
with
an
army
in
dire
need
of
everything
where
besides
being
at
the
beck
and
call
of
the
governor
of
the
place
they
would
be
debarred
from
the
necessities
of
life
while
xenophon
was
thus
employed
the
generals
and
officers
came
back
with
a
message
from
aristarchus
who
had
told
them
they
might
retire
for
the
present
but
in
the
afternoon
he
would
expect
them
the
former
suspicions
of
a
plot
had
now
ripened
to
a
certainty
xenophon
meantime
had
ascertained
that
the
victims
were
favourable
to
his
project
he
personally
and
the
army
as
a
whole
might
with
safety
proceed
to
seuthes
they
seemed
to
say
accordingly
he
took
with
him
polycrates
the
athenian
captain
and
from
each
of
the
generals
not
including
neon
some
one
man
whom
they
could
in
each
case
trust
and
in
the
night
they
set
off
to
visit
the
army
of
seuthes
sixty
furlongs
distant
as
they
approached
they
came
upon
some
deserted
and
their
first
impression
was
that
seuthes
had
shifted
his
position
but
presently
perceiving
a
confused
sound
the
voices
of
seuthes
people
signalling
to
one
another
the
explanation
dawned
on
him
seuthes
kept
his
kindled
in
front
of
instead
of
behind
his
night
pickets
in
order
that
the
outposts
being
in
the
dark
might
escape
notice
their
numbers
and
position
thus
being
a
mystery
whilst
any
party
approaching
from
the
outside
so
far
from
escaping
notice
would
through
the
glare
of
the
fire
stand
out
conspicuously
perceiving
how
matters
stood
xenophon
sent
forward
his
interpreter
who
was
one
of
the
party
and
bade
him
inform
seuthes
that
xenophon
was
there
and
craved
conference
with
him
the
others
asked
if
he
were
an
athenian
from
the
army
yonder
and
no
sooner
had
the
interpreter
replied
yes
the
same
than
up
they
leapt
and
galloped
off
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
a
couple
of
hundred
peltasts
had
come
up
who
seized
and
carried
off
xenophon
and
those
with
him
and
brought
them
to
seuthes
the
latter
was
in
a
tower
right
well
guarded
and
there
were
horses
round
it
in
a
circle
standing
all
ready
bitted
and
bridled
for
his
alarm
was
so
great
that
he
gave
his
horses
their
provender
during
the
day
and
during
the
nights
he
kept
watch
and
ward
with
the
brutes
thus
bitted
and
bridled
it
was
stated
in
explanation
that
in
old
days
an
ancestor
of
his
named
teres
had
been
in
this
very
country
with
a
large
army
several
of
whom
he
had
lost
at
the
hands
of
the
native
inhabitants
besides
being
robbed
of
his
baggage
train
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
are
thynians
and
they
are
reputed
to
be
far
the
most
warlike
set
of
fighters
especially
at
night
instead
of
letting
them
graze
when
they
drew
near
seuthes
bade
xenophon
enter
and
bring
with
him
any
two
he
might
choose
as
soon
as
they
were
inside
they
first
greeted
one
another
warmly
and
then
according
to
the
thracian
custom
pledged
themselves
in
bowls
of
wine
there
was
further
present
at
the
elbow
of
seuthes
medosades
who
on
all
occasions
acted
as
his
xenophon
took
the
initiative
and
spoke
as
follows
you
have
sent
to
me
seuthes
once
and
again
on
the
first
occasion
you
sent
medosades
yonder
to
chalcedon
and
you
begged
me
to
use
my
influence
in
favour
of
the
army
crossing
over
from
asia
you
promised
me
in
return
for
this
conduct
on
my
part
various
kindnesses
at
least
that
is
what
medosades
stated
and
before
proceeding
further
he
turned
to
medosades
and
asked
is
not
that
so
the
other
assented
again
on
a
second
occasion
the
same
medosades
came
when
i
had
crossed
over
from
parium
to
rejoin
the
army
and
he
promised
me
that
if
i
would
bring
you
the
army
you
would
in
various
respects
treat
me
as
a
friend
and
brother
he
said
especially
with
regard
to
certain
seaboard
places
of
which
you
are
the
owner
and
lord
that
you
were
minded
to
make
me
a
present
of
them
at
this
point
he
again
questioned
medosades
whether
the
words
attributed
to
him
were
exact
and
medosades
once
more
fully
assented
come
now
proceeded
xenophon
recount
what
answer
i
made
you
and
first
at
chalcedon
you
answered
that
the
army
was
in
any
case
about
to
cross
over
to
byzantium
and
as
far
as
that
went
there
was
no
need
to
pay
you
or
any
one
else
anything
and
for
yourself
you
added
that
once
across
you
were
minded
to
leave
the
army
which
thing
came
to
pass
even
as
you
said
well
what
did
i
say
he
asked
at
your
next
visit
when
you
came
to
me
in
selybria
you
said
that
the
proposal
was
impossible
you
were
all
going
to
perinthus
to
cross
into
asia
good
said
xenophon
and
in
spite
of
it
all
at
the
present
moment
here
i
am
myself
and
phryniscus
one
of
my
colleagues
and
polycrates
yonder
a
captain
and
outside
to
represent
the
other
generals
all
except
neon
the
laconian
the
trustiest
men
they
could
find
to
send
so
that
if
you
wish
to
give
these
transactions
the
seal
of
still
greater
security
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
summon
them
also
and
do
you
polycrates
go
and
say
from
me
that
i
bid
them
leave
their
arms
outside
and
you
can
leave
your
own
sword
outside
before
you
enter
with
them
on
your
return
when
seuthes
had
heard
so
far
he
interposed
i
should
never
mistrust
an
athenian
for
we
are
relatives
already
i
know
and
the
best
of
friends
i
believe
we
shall
be
after
that
as
soon
as
the
right
men
entered
xenophon
first
questioned
seuthes
as
to
what
use
he
intended
to
make
of
the
army
and
he
replied
as
follows
maesades
was
my
father
his
sway
extended
over
the
melanditae
the
thynians
and
the
tranipsae
then
the
affairs
of
the
odrysians
took
a
bad
turn
and
my
father
was
driven
out
of
this
country
and
later
on
died
himself
of
sickness
leaving
me
to
be
brought
up
as
an
orphan
at
the
court
of
medocus
the
present
king
but
i
when
i
had
grown
to
man
estate
could
not
endure
to
live
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
another
board
so
i
seated
myself
on
the
seat
by
him
as
a
suppliant
and
begged
him
to
give
me
as
many
men
as
he
could
spare
that
i
might
wreak
what
mischief
i
could
on
those
who
had
driven
us
forth
from
our
land
that
thus
i
might
cease
to
live
in
dependence
upon
another
board
like
a
dog
watching
his
master
hand
in
answer
to
my
petition
he
gave
me
the
men
and
the
horses
which
you
will
see
at
break
of
day
and
nowadays
i
live
with
these
pillaging
my
own
ancestral
land
but
if
you
would
join
me
i
think
with
the
help
of
heaven
we
might
easily
recover
my
empire
that
is
what
i
want
of
you
well
then
said
xenophon
supposing
we
came
what
should
you
be
able
to
give
us
the
soldiers
the
officers
and
the
generals
tell
us
that
these
witnesses
may
report
your
answer
and
he
promised
to
give
to
the
common
soldiers
a
cyzicene
to
a
captain
twice
as
much
and
to
a
general
four
times
as
much
with
as
much
land
as
ever
they
liked
some
yoke
of
oxen
and
a
fortified
place
upon
the
seaboard
but
now
supposing
said
xenophon
we
fail
of
success
in
spite
of
our
endeavours
suppose
any
intimidation
on
the
part
of
the
lacedaemonians
should
arise
will
you
receive
into
your
country
any
of
us
who
may
seek
to
find
a
refuge
with
you
he
answered
nay
not
only
so
but
i
shall
look
upon
you
as
my
brothers
entitled
to
share
my
seat
and
the
joint
possessors
of
all
the
wealth
which
we
may
be
able
to
acquire
and
to
you
yourself
o
xenophon
i
will
give
my
daughter
and
if
you
have
a
daughter
i
will
buy
her
in
thracian
fashion
and
i
will
give
you
bisanthe
as
a
which
is
the
fairest
of
all
my
possessions

that
the
thracians

were
connected
through
the
marriage
of

made
alliance
with

king
of
the
odrysians
the
son
of

iii
after
listening
to
these
proposals
they
gave
and
accepted
pledges
of
good
faith
and
so
the
deputation
rode
off
before
day
they
were
back
again
in
camp
and
severally
rendered
a
report
to
those
who
sent
them
at
dawn
aristarchus
again
summoned
the
generals
and
officers
but
the
latter
resolved
to
have
done
with
the
visit
to
aristarchus
and
to
summon
a
meeting
of
the
army
in
full
conclave
the
soldiers
met
with
the
exception
of
neon
men
who
remained
about
ten
furlongs
off
when
they
were
met
together
xenophon
rose
and
made
the
following
announcement
men
aristarchus
with
his
ships
of
war
hinders
us
from
sailing
where
we
fain
would
go
it
is
not
even
safe
to
set
foot
on
board
a
vessel
but
if
he
hinders
us
here
he
hastens
us
there
off
to
the
chersonese
says
he
a
passage
through
the
sacred
mountain
if
we
master
it
and
succeed
in
getting
to
that
place
he
has
something
in
store
for
us
he
promises
that
he
will
not
sell
you
any
more
as
he
did
at
byzantium
you
shall
not
be
cheated
again
you
shall
have
pay
he
will
no
longer
as
now
suffer
you
to
remain
in
want
of
provisions
that
is
his
proposal
but
seuthes
says
that
if
you
will
go
to
him
he
will
treat
you
well
what
you
have
now
to
consider
is
whether
you
will
stay
to
debate
this
question
or
leave
its
settlement
till
we
have
gone
up
into
a
land
of
provisions
if
you
ask
me
my
opinion
it
is
this
since
here
we
have
neither
money
to
buy
nor
leave
to
take
without
money
what
we
need
why
should
we
not
go
up
into
these
villages
where
the
right
to
help
ourselves
is
conferred
by
might
there
unhampered
by
the
want
of
bare
necessaries
you
can
listen
to
what
this
man
and
the
other
wants
of
you
and
choose
whichever
sounds
best
let
those
he
added
who
agree
to
this
hold
up
their
hands
they
all
held
them
up
retire
then
said
he
and
get
your
kit
together
and
at
the
word
of
command
follow
your
leader
after
this
xenophon
put
himself
at
the
head
and
the
rest
followed
neon
indeed
and
other
agents
from
aristarchus
tried
to
turn
them
from
their
purpose
but
to
their
persuasions
they
turned
a
deaf
ear
they
had
not
advanced
much
more
than
three
miles
when
seuthes
met
them
and
xenophon
seeing
him
bade
him
ride
up
he
wished
to
tell
him
what
they
felt
to
be
conducive
to
their
interests
and
in
the
presence
of
as
many
witnesses
as
possible
as
soon
as
he
had
approached
xenophon
said
we
are
going
where
the
troops
will
have
enough
to
live
upon
when
we
are
there
we
will
listen
to
you
and
to
the
emissaries
of
the
laconian
and
choose
between
you
both
whatever
seems
best
if
then
you
will
lead
us
where
provisions
are
to
be
got
in
plenty
we
shall
feel
indebted
to
you
for
your
hospitality
and
seuthes
answered
for
the
matter
of
that
i
know
many
villages
and
stocked
with
all
kinds
of
provisions
just
far
enough
off
to
give
you
a
good
appetite
for
your
breakfasts
lead
on
then
said
xenophon
when
they
had
reached
the
villages
in
the
afternoon
the
soldiers
met
and
seuthes
made
the
following
speech
my
request
to
you
sirs
is
that
you
will
take
the
field
with
me
and
my
promise
to
you
is
that
i
will
give
every
man
of
you
a
cyzicene
and
to
the
officers
and
generals
at
the
customary
rate
besides
this
i
will
honour
those
who
show
special
merit
food
and
drink
you
shall
get
as
now
for
yourselves
from
the
country
but
whatever
is
captured
i
shall
claim
to
have
myself
so
that
by
distribution
of
it
i
may
provide
you
with
pay
let
them
flee
let
them
creep
into
we
shall
be
able
to
pursue
after
them
we
will
track
them
out
or
if
they
resist
along
with
you
we
will
endeavour
to
subdue
them
to
our
hands
xenophon
inquired
and
how
far
from
the
sea
shall
you
expect
the
army
to
follow
you
nowhere
more
than
seven
days
journey
he
answered
and
in
many
places
less
after
this
permission
was
given
for
all
who
wished
to
speak
and
many
spoke
but
ever
to
one
and
the
same
tune
what
seuthes
said
was
very
right
it
was
winter
and
for
a
man
to
sail
home
even
if
he
had
the
will
to
do
so
was
impossible
on
the
other
hand
to
continue
long
in
a
friendly
country
where
they
must
depend
upon
what
they
could
purchase
was
equally
beyond
their
power
if
they
were
to
wear
away
time
and
support
life
in
a
hostile
country
it
was
safer
to
do
so
with
seuthes
than
by
themselves
not
to
speak
of
all
these
good
things
but
if
they
were
going
to
get
pay
into
the
bargain
that
indeed
was
a
godsend
to
complete
the
proceedings
xenophon
said
if
any
one
opposes
the
measure
let
him
state
his
views
if
not
let
the
officer
put
the
proposition
to
the
vote
no
one
opposed
they
put
it
to
the
vote
and
the
resolution
was
carried
and
without
loss
of
time
he
informed
seuthes
that
they
would
take
the
field
with
him
after
this
the
troops
messed
in
their
separate
divisions
but
the
generals
and
officers
were
invited
by
seuthes
to
dinner
at
a
neighbouring
village
which
was
in
his
possession
when
they
were
at
the
doors
and
on
the
point
of
stepping
in
to
dinner
they
were
met
by
a
certain
heracleides
of
maronea
he
came
up
to
each
guest
addressing
himself
particularly
to
those
who
as
he
conjectured
ought
to
be
able
to
make
a
present
to
seuthes
he
addressed
himself
first
to
some
parians
who
were
there
to
arrange
a
friendship
with
medocus
the
king
of
the
odrysians
and
were
bearers
of
presents
to
the
king
and
to
his
wife
heracleides
reminded
them
medocus
is
up
country
twelve
days
journey
from
the
sea
but
seuthes
now
that
he
has
got
this
army
will
be
lord
on
the
as
your
neighbour
then
he
is
the
man
to
do
you
good
or
do
you
ill
if
you
are
wise
you
will
give
him
whatever
he
askes
of
you
on
the
whole
it
will
be
laid
out
at
better
interest
than
if
you
have
it
to
medocus
who
lives
so
far
off
that
was
his
mode
of
persuasion
in
their
case
next
he
came
to
timasion
the
dardanian
who
some
one
had
told
him
was
the
happy
possessor
of
certain
goblets
and
oriental
carpets
what
he
said
to
him
was
it
is
customary
when
people
are
invited
to
dinner
by
seuthes
for
the
guests
to
make
him
a
present
now
if
he
should
become
a
great
person
in
these
parts
he
will
be
able
to
restore
you
to
your
native
land
or
to
make
you
a
rich
man
here
such
were
the
solicitations
which
he
applied
to
each
man
in
turn
whom
he
accosted
presently
he
came
to
xenophon
and
said
you
are
at
once
a
citizen
of
no
mean
city
and
with
seuthes
also
your
own
name
is
very
great
maybe
you
expect
to
obtain
a
fort
or
two
in
this
country
just
as
others
of
your
countrymen
have
done
and
territory
it
is
only
right
and
proper
therefore
that
you
should
honour
seuthes
in
the
most
magnificent
style
be
sure
i
give
this
advice
out
of
pure
friendliness
for
i
know
that
the
greater
the
gift
that
you
are
ready
to
bestow
on
him
the
better
the
treatment
you
will
receive
at
his
hands
xenophon
on
hearing
this
was
in
a
sad
dilemma
for
he
had
brought
with
him
when
he
crossed
from
parium
nothing
but
one
boy
and
just
enough
to
pay
his
travelling
expenses
a
greek
colony
in
thrace
among
colonies
were
abdera
founded
by
teos
and
maroneia
celebrated
for
its
wine
founded
by
chios
about
kiepert
man
anct
geog
viii
notably
alcibiades
who
possessed
two
or
three
such
fortresses
as
soon
as
the
company
consisting
of
the
most
powerful
thracians
there
present
with
the
generals
and
captains
of
the
hellenes
and
any
embassy
from
a
state
which
might
be
there
had
arrived
they
were
seated
in
a
circle
and
the
dinner
was
served
thereupon
stools
were
brought
in
and
placed
in
front
of
the
assembled
guests
they
were
laden
with
pieces
of
meat
piled
up
and
there
were
huge
fastened
on
to
the
pieces
of
meat
with
long
skewers
the
tables
as
a
rule
were
set
beside
the
guests
at
intervals
that
was
the
custom
and
seuthes
set
the
fashion
of
the
performance
he
took
up
the
loaves
which
lay
by
his
side
and
broke
them
into
little
pieces
and
then
threw
the
fragments
here
to
one
and
there
to
another
as
seemed
to
him
good
and
so
with
the
meat
likewise
leaving
for
himself
the
merest
taste
then
the
rest
fell
to
following
the
fashion
set
them
those
that
is
who
had
tables
placed
beside
them
now
there
was
an
arcadian
arystas
by
name
a
huge
eater
he
soon
got
tired
of
throwing
the
pieces
about
and
seized
a
good
loaf
in
his
two
hands
placed
some
pieces
of
meat
upon
his
knees
and
proceeded
to
discuss
his
dinner
then
beakers
of
wine
were
brought
round
and
every
one
partook
in
turn
but
when
the
cupbearer
came
to
arystas
and
handed
him
the
bowl
he
looked
up
and
seeing
that
xenophon
had
done
eating
give
it
him
quoth
he
he
is
more
at
leisure
i
have
something
better
to
do
at
present
seuthes
hearing
a
remark
asked
the
cupbearer
what
was
said
and
the
cupbearer
who
knew
how
to
talk
greek
explained
then
followed
a
peal
of
laughter
when
the
drinking
had
advanced
somewhat
in
came
a
thracian
with
a
white
horse
who
snatched
the
brimming
bowl
and
said
here
a
health
to
thee
o
seuthes
let
me
present
thee
with
this
horse
mounted
on
him
thou
shalt
capture
whom
thou
choosest
to
pursue
or
retiring
from
battle
thou
shalt
not
dread
the
foe
he
was
followed
by
one
who
brought
in
a
boy
and
presented
him
in
proper
style
with
here
a
health
to
thee
o
seuthes
a
third
had
clothes
for
his
wife
timasion
the
dardanian
pledged
seuthes
and
presented
a
silver
bowl
and
a
carpet
worth
ten
minae
gnesippus
an
athenian
got
up
and
said
it
was
a
good
old
custom
and
a
fine
one
too
that
those
who
had
should
give
to
the
king
for
honour
sake
but
to
those
who
had
not
the
king
should
give
whereby
my
lord
he
added
i
too
may
one
day
have
the
wherewithal
to
give
thee
gifts
and
honour
xenophon
the
while
was
racking
his
brains
what
he
was
to
do
he
was
not
the
happier
because
he
was
seated
in
the
seat

the

him
the

perhaps
a
little
mounted
to
his

he
rose
and
manfully
seized
the
cup
and
spoke
i
also
seuthes
have
to
present
you
with
myself
and
these
my
dear
comrades
to
be
your
trusty
friends
and
not
one
of
them
against
his
will
they
are
more
ready
one
and
all
still
more
than
i
to
be
your
friends
here
they
are
they
ask
nothing
from
you
in
return
rather
they
are
forward
to
labour
in
your
behalf
it
will
be
their
pleasure
to
bear
the
brunt
of
battle
in
voluntary
service
with
them
god
willing
you
will
gain
vast
territory
you
will
recover
what
was
once
your
forefathers
you
will
win
for
yourself
new
lands
and
not
lands
only
but
horses
many
and
of
men
a
multitude
and
many
a
fair
dame
besides
you
will
not
need
to
seize
upon
them
in
robber
fashion
it
is
your
friends
here
who
of
their
own
accord
shall
take
and
bring
them
to
you
they
shall
lay
them
at
your
feet
as

at

musicians
blowing
upon

such
as
they
use
for

calls
and
trumpeting
on
trumpets
made
of
raw

tunes
and

seuthes
himself
got
up
and
shouted
trolling
forth
a

song
then
he
sprang
from
his
place
and
leapt
about
as

he
would
guard
himself
against

came
in

of

is

to
have

no

well
known
to
be
intolerable
therefore
no

interval
was
employed
at
all
but
when
the
sun
began
to
set
the
hellenes
rose
from
their
seats
it
was
time
they
said
to
place
the
night
sentinels
and
to
pass
the
watchword
further
they
begged
of
seuthes
to
issue
an
order
that
none
of
the
thracians
were
to
enter
the
hellenic
camp
at
night
since
between
your
thracian
foes
and
our
thracian
friends
there
might
be
some
confusion
as
they
sallied
forth
seuthes
rose
to
accompany
them
like
the
soberest
of
men
when
they
were
outside
he
summoned
the
generals
apart
and
said
sirs
our
enemies
are
not
aware
as
yet
of
our
alliance
if
therefore
we
attack
them
before
they
take
precautions
not
to
be
caught
or
are
prepared
to
repel
assault
we
shall
make
a
fine
haul
of
captives
and
other
stock
the
generals
fully
approved
of
these
views
and
bade
him
lead
on
he
answered
prepare
and
wait
as
soon
as
the
right
time
comes
i
will
be
with
you
i
shall
pick
up
the
peltasts
and
yourselves
and
with
the
help
of
the
gods
i
will
lead
on
but
consider
one
point
urged
xenophon
if
we
are
to
march
by
night
is
not
the
hellenic
fashion
best
when
marching
in
the
daytime
that
part
of
the
army
leads
the
van
which
seems
best
suited
to
the
nature
of
the
country
to
be
traversed
heavy
or
light
infantry
or
cavalry
but
by
night
our
rule
is
that
the
slowest
arm
should
take
the
lead
thus
we
avoid
the
risk
of
being
pulled
to
pieces
and
it
is
not
so
easy
for
a
man
to
give
his
neighbour
the
slip
without
intending
whereas
the
scattered
fragments
of
an
army
are
apt
to
fall
foul
of
one
another
and
to
cause
damage
or
incur
it
in
sheer
ignorance
to
this
seuthes
replied
you
reason
well
and
i
will
adopt
your
custom
i
will
furnish
you
with
guides
chosen
from
the
oldest
experts
of
the
country
and
i
will
myself
follow
with
the
cavalry
in
the
rear
it
will
not
take
me
long
if
need
be
to
present
myself
at
the
front
then
for
kinship
sake
they
chose
athenaia
as
their
watchword
with
this
they
turned
and
sought
repose
our
lady
of
athens
it
was
about
midnight
when
seuthes
presented
himself
with
his
cavalry
troopers
armed
with
corselets
and
his
light
infantry
under
arms
as
soon
as
he
had
handed
over
to
them
the
promised
guides
the
heavy
infantry
took
the
van
followed
by
the
light
troops
in
the
centre
while
the
cavalry
brought
up
the
rear
at
daybreak
seuthes
rode
up
to
the
front
he
complimented
them
on
their
method
so
often
had
he
himself
while
marching
by
night
with
a
mere
handful
of
men
been
separated
with
his
cavalry
from
his
infantry
but
now
said
he
we
find
ourselves
at
dawn
of
day
all
happily
together
just
as
we
ought
to
be
do
you
wait
for
me
here
he
proceeded
and
recruit
yourselves
i
will
take
a
look
round
and
rejoin
you
so
saying
he
took
a
certain
path
over
hill
and
rode
off
as
soon
as
he
had
reached
deep
snow
he
looked
to
see
whether
there
were
footprints
of
human
beings
leading
forward
or
in
the
opposite
direction
and
having
satisfied
himself
that
the
road
was
untrodden
back
he
came
exclaiming
god
willing
sirs
it
will
be
all
right
we
shall
fall
on
the
fellows
before
they
know
where
they
are
i
will
lead
on
with
the
cavalry
so
that
if
we
catch
sight
of
any
one
he
shall
not
escape
and
give
warning
to
the
enemy
do
you
follow
and
if
you
are
left
behind
keep
to
the
trail
of
the
horses
once
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
we
shall
find
ourselves
in
numerous
thriving
villages
by
the
middle
of
the
day
he
had
already
gained
the
top
of
the
pass
and
looked
down
upon
the
villages
below
back
he
came
riding
to
the
heavy
infantry
and
said
i
will
at
once
send
off
the
cavalry
into
the
plain
below
and
the
peltasts
too
to
attack
the
villages
do
you
follow
with
what
speed
you
may
so
that
in
case
of
resistance
you
may
lend
us
your
aid
hearing
this
xenophon
dismounted
and
the
other
asked
why
do
you
dismount
just
when
speed
is
the
thing
we
want
the
other
answered
but
you
do
not
want
me
alone
i
am
sure
the
hoplites
will
run
all
the
quicker
and
more
cheerily
if
i
lead
them
on
foot
thereupon
seuthes
went
off
and
timasion
with
him
taking
the
hellene
squadron
of
something
like
forty
troopers
then
xenophon
passed
the
order
the
active
young
fellows
up
to
thirty
years
of
age
from
the
different
companies
to
the
front
and
off
with
these
he
went
himself
bowling
along
while
cleanor
led
the
other
hellenes
when
they
had
reached
the
villages
seuthes
with
about
thirty
troopers
rode
up
exclaiming
well
xenophon
this
is
just
what
you
said
the
fellows
are
caught
but
now
look
here
my
cavalry
have
gone
off
unsupported
they
are
scattered
in
pursuit
one
here
one
there
and
upon
my
word
i
am
more
than
half
afraid
the
enemy
will
collect
somewhere
and
do
them
a
mischief
some
of
us
must
remain
in
the
villages
for
they
are
swarming
with
human
beings
well
then
said
xenophon
i
will
seize
the
heights
with
the
men
i
have
with
me
and
do
you
bid
cleanor
extend
his
line
along
the
level
beside
the
villages
when
they
had
done
so
there
were
enclosed
of
captives
for
the
slave
market
one
thousand
of
cattle
two
thousand
and
of
other
small
cattle
ten
thousand
for
the
time
being
they
took
up
quarters
there
etropkhaze
a
favourite
word
with
our
author
herodotus
uses
it
so
does
aristot
so
also
polybius
but
the
atticists
condemn
it
except
of
course
in
poetry
iv
but
the
next
day
seuthes
burnt
the
villages
to
the
ground
he
left
not
a
single
house
being
minded
to
inspire
terror
in
the
rest
of
his
enemies
and
to
show
them
what
they
also
were
to
expect
if
they
refused
obedience
and
so
he
went
back
again
as
to
the
booty
he
sent
off
heracliedes
to
perinthus
to
dispose
of
it
with
a
view
to
future
pay
for
the
soldiers
but
for
himself
he
encamped
with
the
hellenes
in
the
lowland
country
of
the
thynians
the
natives
leaving
the
flats
and
betaking
themselves
in
flight
to
the
uplands
there
was
deep
snow
and
cold
so
intense
that
the
water
brought
in
for
dinner
and
the
wine
within
the
jars
froze
and
many
of
the
hellenes
had
their
noses
and
ears
now
they
came
to
understand
why
the
thracians
wear
caps
on
their
heads
and
about
their
ears
and
why
on
the
same
principle
they
are
frocked
not
only
about
the
chest
and
bust
but
so
as
to
cover
the
loins
and
thighs
as
well
and
why
on
horseback
they
envelop
themselves
in
long
shawls
which
reach
down
to
the
feet
instead
of
the
ordinary
short
rider
cloak
seuthes
sent
off
some
of
the
prisoners
to
the
hills
with
a
message
to
say
that
if
they
did
not
come
down
to
their
homes
and
live
quietly
and
obey
him
he
would
burn
down
their
villages
and
their
corn
and
leave
them
to
perish
with
hunger
thereupon
down
they
came
women
and
children
and
the
older
men
the
younger
men
preferred
to
quarter
themselves
in
the
villages
on
the
skirts
of
the
hills
on
discovering
this
seuthes
bade
xenophon
take
the
youngest
of
the
heavy
infantry
and
join
him
on
an
expedition
they
rose
in
the
night
and
by
daybreak
had
reached
the
villages
but
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
made
good
their
escape
for
the
hills
were
close
at
hand
those
whom
he
did
catch
seuthes
unsparingly
shot
down
now
there
was
a
certain
olynthian
named
episthenes
he
was
a
great
lover
of
boys
and
seeing
a
handsome
lad
just
in
the
bloom
of
youth
and
carrying
a
light
shield
about
to
be
slain
he
ran
up
to
xenophon
and
supplicated
him
to
rescue
the
fair
youth
xenophon
went
to
seuthes
and
begged
him
not
to
put
the
boy
to
death
he
explained
to
him
the
disposition
of
episthenes
how
he
had
once
enrolled
a
company
the
only
qualification
required
being
that
of
personal
beauty
and
with
these
handsome
young
men
at
his
side
there
were
none
so
brave
as
he
seuthes
put
the
question
would
you
like
to
die
on
his
behalf
episthenes
whereat
the
other
stretched
out
his
neck
and
said
strike
if
the
boy
bids
you
and
will
thank
his
preserver
seuthes
turning
to
the
boy
asked
shall
i
smite
him
instead
of
you
the
boy
shook
his
head
imploring
him
to
slay
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
whereupon
episthenes
caught
the
lad
in
his
arms
exclaiming
it
is
time
you
did
battle
with
me
seuthes
for
my
boy
never
will
i
yield
him
up
and
seuthes
laughed
what
must
be
must
and
so
consented
in
these
villages
he
decided
that
they
must
bivouac
so
that
the
men
on
the
mountains
might
be
still
further
deprived
of
subsistence
stealthily
descending
he
himself
found
quarters
in
the
plain
while
xenophon
with
his
picked
troops
encamped
in
the
highest
village
on
the
skirts
of
the
hills
and
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
hard
by
among
the
highland
thracians
as
they
are
called
cf
highlanders
after
this
not
many
days
had
idly
slipt
away
before
the
thracians
from
the
mountains
came
down
and
wished
to
arrange
with
seuthes
for
terms
of
truce
and
hostages
simultaneously
came
xenophon
and
informed
seuthes
that
they
were
camped
in
bad
quarters
with
the
enemy
next
door
it
would
be
pleasanter
too
he
added
to
bivouac
in
a
strong
position
in
the
open
than
under
cover
on
the
edge
of
destruction
the
other
bade
him
take
heart
and
pointed
to
some
of
their
hostages
as
much
as
to
say
look
there
parties
also
from
the
mountaineers
came
down
and
pleaded
with
xenophon
himself
to
help
arrange
a
truce
for
them
this
he
agreed
to
do
bidding
them
to
pluck
up
heart
and
assuring
them
that
they
would
meet
with
no
mischief
if
they
yielded
obedience
to
seuthes
all
their
parleying
however
was
as
it
turned
out
merely
to
get
a
closer
inspection
of
things
this
happened
in
the
day
and
in
the
following
night
the
thynians
descended
from
the
hill
country
and
made
an
attack
in
each
case
the
guide
was
the
master
of
the
house
attacked
otherwise
it
would
have
taxed
their
powers
to
discover
the
houses
in
the
dark
which
for
the
sake
of
their
flocks
and
herds
were
palisaded
all
round
with
great
stockades
as
soon
as
they
had
reached
the
doors
of
any
particular
house
the
attack
began
some
hurling
in
their
spears
others
belabouring
with
their
clubs
which
they
carried
it
was
said
for
the
purpose
of
knocking
off
the
lance
points
from
the
shaft
others
were
busy
setting
the
place
on
fire
and
they
kept
calling
xenophon
by
name
come
out
xenophon
and
die
like
a
man
or
we
will
roast
you
alive
inside
by
this
time
too
the
flames
were
making
their
appearance
through
the
roof
and
xenophon
and
his
followers
were
within
with
their
coats
of
mail
on
and
big
shields
swords
and
helmets
then
silanus
a
macistian
a
youth
of
some
eighteen
years
signalled
on
the
trumpet
and
in
an
instant
out
they
all
leapt
with
their
drawn
swords
and
the
inmates
of
other
quarters
as
well
the
thracians
took
to
their
heels
according
to
their
custom
swinging
their
light
shields
round
their
backs
as
they
leapt
over
the
stockade
some
were
captured
hanging
on
the
top
with
their
shields
caught
in
the
palings
others
missed
the
way
out
and
so
were
slain
and
the
hellenes
chased
them
hotly
till
they
were
outside
the
village
of
macistus
a
town
in
the
triphylia
near
scillus
a
party
of
thynians
turned
back
and
as
the
men
ran
past
in
bold
relief
against
a
blazing
house
they
let
fly
a
volley
of
javelins
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
glare
and
wounded
two
captains
hieronymus
an
euodean
and
theogenes
a
locrian
no
one
was
killed
only
the
clothes
and
baggage
of
some
of
the
men
were
consumed
in
the
flames
presently
up
came
seuthes
to
the
rescue
with
seven
troopers
the
first
to
hand
and
his
thracian
trumpeteer
by
his
side
seeing
that
something
had
happened
he
hastened
to
the
rescue
and
ever
the
while
his
bugler
wound
his
horn
which
music
added
terror
to
the
foe
arrived
at
length
he
greeted
them
with
outstretched
hand
exclaiming
i
thought
to
find
you
all
dead
men
if
this
is
the
same
man
as
hieronymus
of
elis
who
has
been
mentioned
two
or
three
times
already
possibly
the
word
euodea
points
to
some
town
or
district
of
elis
or
perhaps
the
text
is
corrupt
after
that
xenophon
begged
him
to
hand
over
the
hostages
to
himself
and
if
so
disposed
to
join
him
on
an
expedition
to
the
hills
or
if
not
to
let
him
go
alone
accordingly
the
next
day
seuthes
delivered
up
the
hostages
they
were
men
already
advanced
in
years
but
the
pick
of
the
mountaineers
as
they
themselves
gave
out
not
merely
did
seuthes
do
this
but
he
came
himself
with
his
force
at
his
back
and
by
this
time
he
had
treble
his
former
force
for
many
of
the
odrysians
hearing
of
his
proceedings
came
down
to
join
in
the
campaign
and
the
thynians
espying
from
the
mountains
the
vast
array
of
heavy
infantry
and
light
infantry
and
cavalry
rank
upon
rank
came
down
and
supplicated
him
to
make
terms
they
were
ready
they
professed
to
do
all
that
he
demanded
let
him
take
pledges
of
their
good
faith
so
seuthes
summoned
xenophon
and
explained
their
proposals
adding
that
he
should
make
no
terms
with
them
if
xenophon
wished
to
punish
them
for
their
night
attack
the
latter
replied
for
my
part
i
should
think
their
punishment
is
great
enough
already
if
they
are
to
be
slaves
instead
of
free
men
still
he
added
i
advise
you
for
the
future
to
take
as
hostages
those
who
are
most
capable
of
doing
mischief
and
to
let
the
old
men
abide
in
peace
at
home
so
to
a
man
they
gave
in
their
adhesion
in
that
quarter
of
the
country
v
crossing
over
in
the
direction
of
the
thracians
above
byzantium
they
reached
the
delta
as
it
is
called
here
they
were
no
longer
in
the
territory
of
the
maesades
but
in
the
country
of
teres
the
odrysian
an
ancient
worthy
here
heracleides
met
them
with
the
proceeds
of
the
spoil
and
seuthes
picked
out
three
pairs
of
mules
there
were
only
three
the
other
teams
being
oxen
then
he
summoned
xenophon
and
bade
him
take
them
and
divide
the
rest
between
the
generals
and
officers
to
which
xenophon
replied
that
for
himself
he
was
content
to
receive
his
share
another
time
but
added
make
a
present
of
these
to
my
friends
here
the
generals
who
have
served
with
me
and
to
the
officers
so
of
the
pairs
of
mules
timasion
the
dardanian
received
one
cleanor
the
orchomenian
one
and
phryniscus
the
achaean
one
the
teams
of
oxen
were
divided
among
the
officers
then
seuthes
proceeded
to
remit
pay
due
for
the
month
already
passed
but
all
he
could
give
was
the
equivalent
of
twenty
days
heracleides
insisted
that
this
was
all
he
had
got
by
his
trafficking
whereupon
xenophon
with
some
warmth
exclaimed
upon
my
word
heracleides
i
do
not
think
you
care
for
seuthes
interest
as
you
should
if
you
did
you
have
been
at
pains
to
bring
back
the
full
amount
of
the
pay
even
if
you
had
had
to
raise
a
loan
to
do
so
and
if
by
no
other
means
by
selling
the
coat
off
your
own
back
see
above
re
previous
teres
the
words
an
ancient
worthy
may
possibly
be
an
editor
or
commentator
note
what
he
said
annoyed
heracleides
who
was
afraid
of
being
ousted
from
the
friendship
of
seuthes
and
from
that
day
forward
he
did
his
best
to
calumniate
xenophon
before
seuthes
the
soldiers
on
their
side
laid
the
blame
of
course
on
xenophon
where
was
their
pay
and
seuthes
was
vexed
with
him
for
persistently
demanding
it
for
them
up
to
this
date
he
had
frequently
referred
to
what
he
would
do
when
he
got
to
the
seaboard
again
how
he
intended
to
hand
over
to
him
bisanthe
ganos
and
neontichos
but
from
this
time
forward
he
never
mentioned
one
of
them
again
the
slanderous
tongue
of
heracleides
had
whispered
him
it
was
not
safe
to
hand
over
fortified
towns
to
a
man
with
a
force
at
his
back
for
bisanthe
see
above
ganos
a
little
lower
down
the
coast
with
neontichos
once
belonged
to
alcibiades
if
we
may
believe
cornelius
nepos
alc
vii
and
plutarch
alc
see
above
consequently
xenophon
fell
to
considering
what
he
ought
to
do
as
regards
marching
any
further
up
the
country
and
heracleides
introduced
the
other
generals
to
seuthes
urging
them
to
say
that
they
were
quite
as
well
able
to
lead
the
army
as
xenophon
and
promising
them
that
within
a
day
or
two
they
should
have
full
pay
for
two
months
and
he
again
implored
them
to
continue
the
campaign
with
seuthes
to
which
timasion
replied
that
for
his
part
he
would
continue
no
campaign
without
xenophon
not
even
if
they
were
to
give
him
pay
for
five
months
and
what
timasion
said
phryniscus
and
cleanor
repeated
the
views
of
all
three
coincided
seuthes
fell
to
upbraiding
heracleides
in
round
terms
why
had
he
not
invited
xenophon
with
the
others
and
presently
they
invited
him
but
by
himself
alone
he
perceiving
the
knavery
of
heracleides
and
that
his
object
was
to
calumniate
him
with
the
other
generals
presented
himself
but
at
the
same
time
he
took
care
to
bring
all
the
generals
and
the
officers
after
their
joint
consent
had
been
secured
they
continued
the
campaign
keeping
the
pontus
on
their
right
they
passed
through
the
thracians
as
they
are
called
and
reached
salmydessus
this
is
a
point
at
which
many
trading
vessels
bound
for
the
black
sea
run
aground
and
are
wrecked
owing
to
a
sort
of
marshy
ledge
or
sandbank
which
runs
out
for
a
considerable
distance
into
the
sea
the
thracians
who
dwell
in
these
parts
have
set
up
pillars
as
boundary
marks
and
each
set
of
them
has
the
pillage
of
its
own
flotsom
and
jetsom
for
in
old
days
before
they
set
up
these
landmarks
the
wreckers
it
is
said
used
freely
to
fall
foul
of
and
slay
one
another
here
was
a
rich
treasure
trove
of
beds
and
boxes
numberless
with
a
mass
of
written
books
and
all
the
various
things
which
mariners
carry
in
their
wooden
chests
having
reduced
this
district
they
turned
round
and
went
back
again
by
this
time
the
army
of
seuthes
had
grown
to
be
considerably
larger
than
the
hellenic
army
for
on
the
one
hand
the
odrysians
flocked
down
in
still
larger
numbers
and
on
the
other
the
tribes
which
gave
in
their
adhesion
from
time
to
time
were
amalgamated
with
his
armament
they
got
into
quarters
on
the
flat
country
above
selybria
at
about
three
miles
distance
from
the
sea
as
to
pay
not
a
penny
was
as
yet
forthcoming
and
the
soldiers
were
cruelly
disaffected
to
xenophon
whilst
seuthes
on
his
side
was
no
longer
so
friendlily
disposed
if
xenophon
ever
wished
to
come
face
to
face
with
him
want
of
leisure
or
some
other
difficulty
always
seemed

is

of
the
way
to
perinthus
vi
at
this
date
when
nearly
two
months
had
already
passed
an
embassy
arrived
these
were
two
agents
from
thibron
charminus
a
lacedaemonian
and
polynicus
they
were
sent
to
say
that
the
lacedaemonians
had
resolved
to
open
a
campaign
against
tissaphernes
and
that
thibron
who
had
set
sail
to
conduct
the
war
was
anxious
to
avail
himself
of
the
troops
he
could
guarantee
that
each
soldier
should
receive
a
daric
a
month
as
pay
the
officers
double
pay
and
the
generals
quadruple
the
lacedaemonian
emissaries
had
no
sooner
arrived
than
heracleides
having
learnt
that
they
had
come
in
search
of
the
hellenic
troops
goes
off
himself
to
seuthes
and
says
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
the
lacedaemonians
want
these
troops
and
you
have
done
with
them
so
that
if
you
hand
over
the
troops
to
them
you
will
do
the
lacedaemonians
a
good
turn
and
will
cease
to
be
bothered
for
pay
any
more
the
country
will
be
quit
of
them
once
and
for
ever
on
hearing
this
seuthes
bade
him
introduce
the
emissaries
as
soon
as
they
had
stated
that
the
object
of
their
coming
was
to
treat
for
the
hellenic
troops
he
replied
that
he
would
willingly
give
them
up
that
his
one
desire
was
to
be
the
friend
and
ally
of
lacedaemon
so
he
invited
them
to
partake
of
hospitality
and
entertained
them
magnificently
but
he
did
not
invite
xenophon
nor
indeed
any
of
the
other
generals
presently
the
lacedaemonians
asked
what
sort
of
man
is
xenophon
and
seuthes
answered
not
a
bad
fellow
in
most
respects
but
he
is
too
much
the
soldiers
friend
and
that
is
why
it
goes
ill
with
him
they
asked
does
he
play
the
popular
leader
and
heracleides
answered
exactly
so
well
then
said
they
he
will
oppose
our
taking
away
the
troops
will
he
not
to
be
sure
he
will
said
heracleides
but
you
have
only
to
call
a
meeting
of
the
whole
body
and
promise
them
pay
and
little
further
heed
will
they
pay
to
him
they
will
run
off
with
you
how
then
are
we
to
get
them
collected
they
asked
early
said
heracleides
we
will
bring
you
to
them
and
i
know
he
added
once
more
as
soon
as
they
set
eyes
on
you
they
will
flock
to
you
with
alacrity
thus
the
day
ended
the
next
day
seuthes
and
heracleides
brought
the
two
laconian
agents
to
the
army
and
the
troops
were
collected
and
the
agents
made
a
statement
as
follows
the
lacedaemonians
have
resolved
on
war
with
tissaphernes
who
did
you
so
much
wrong
by
going
with
us
therefore
you
will
punish
your
enemy
and
each
of
you
will
get
a
daric
a
month
the
officers
twice
that
sum
and
the
generals
quadruple
the
soldiers
lent
willing
ears
and
up
jumped
one
of
the
arcadians
at
once
to
find
fault
with
xenophon
seuthes
also
was
hard
by
wishing
to
know
what
was
going
to
happen
he
stood
within
ear
shot
and
his
interpreter
by
his
side
not
but
what
he
could
understand
most
of
what
was
said
in
greek
himself
at
this
point
the
arcadian
spoke
for
the
matter
of
that
lacedaemonians
we
should
have
been
by
your
sides
long
ago
if
xenophon
had
not
persuaded
us
and
brought
us
hither
we
have
never
ceased
campaigning
night
and
day
the
dismal
winter
through
but
he
reaps
the
fruit
of
our
toils
seuthes
has
enriched
him
privately
but
deprives
us
of
our
honest
earnings
so
that
standing
here
as
i
do
to
address
you
first
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
i
might
see
the
fellow
stoned
to
death
as
a
penalty
for
all
the
long
dance
he
has
led
us
i
should
feel
i
had
got
my
pay
in
full
and
no
longer
grudge
the
pains
we
have
undergone
the
speaker
was
followed
by
another
and
then
another
in
the
same
strain
and
after
that
xenophon
made
the
following
speech
true
is
the
old
adage
there
is
nothing
which
mortal
man
may
not
expect
to
see
here
am
i
being
accused
by
you
just
where
my
conscience
tells
me
that
i
have
displayed
the
greatest
zeal
on
your
behalf
was
i
not
actually
on
my
road
home
when
i
turned
back
not
god
knows
because
i
learned
that
you
were
in
luck
way
but
because
i
heard
that
you
were
in
sore
straits
and
i
wished
to
help
you
if
in
any
way
i
could
i
returned
and
seuthes
yonder
sent
me
messenger
after
messenger
and
made
me
promise
upon
promise
if
only
i
could
persuade
you
to
come
to
him
yet
as
you
yourselves
will
bear
me
witness
i
was
not
to
be
diverted
instead
of
setting
my
hand
to
do
that
i
simply
led
you
to
a
point
from
which
with
least
loss
of
time
i
thought
you
could
cross
into
asia
this
i
believed
was
the
best
thing
for
you
and
you
i
knew
desired
it
but
when
aristarchus
came
with
his
ships
of
war
and
hindered
our
passage
across
you
will
hardly
quarrel
with
me
for
the
step
i
then
took
in
calling
you
together
that
we
might
advisedly
consider
our
best
course
having
heard
both
sides
first
aristarchus
who
ordered
you
to
march
to
the
chersonese
then
seuthes
who
pleaded
with
you
to
undertake
a
campaign
with
himself
you
all
proposed
to
go
with
seuthes
and
you
all
gave
your
votes
to
that
effect
what
wrong
did
i
commit
in
bringing
you
whither
you
were
eager
to
go
if
indeed
since
the
time
when
seuthes
began
to
tell
lies
and
cheat
us
about
the
pay
i
have
supported
him
in
this
you
may
justly
find
fault
with
me
and
hate
me
but
if
i
who
at
first
was
most
of
all
his
friend
am
more
than
any
one
else
at
variance
with
him
how
can
i
who
have
chosen
you
and
rejected
seuthes
in
fairness
be
blamed
by
you
for
the
very
thing
which
has
been
the
ground
of
quarrel
between
him
and
me
but
you
will
tell
me
perhaps
that
i
get
from
seuthes
what
is
by
right
yours
and
that
i
deal
subtly
by
you
but
is
it
not
clear
that
if
seuthes
has
paid
me
anything
he
has
at
any
rate
not
done
so
with
the
intention
of
losing
by
what
he
gives
me
whilst
he
is
still
your
debtor
if
he
gave
to
me
he
gave
in
order
that
by
a
small
gift
to
me
he
might
escape
a
larger
payment
to
yourselves
but
if
that
is
what
you
really
think
has
happened
you
can
render
this
whole
scheme
of
ours
null
and
void
in
an
instant
by
exacting
from
him
the
money
which
is
your
due
it
is
clear
seuthes
will
demand
back
from
me
whatever
i
have
got
from
him
and
he
will
have
all
the
more
right
to
do
so
if
i
have
failed
to
secure
for
him
what
he
bargained
for
when
i
took
his
gifts
but
indeed
i
am
far
removed
from
enjoying
what
is
yours
and
i
swear
to
you
by
all
the
gods
and
goddesses
that
i
have
not
taken
even
what
seuthes
promised
me
in
private
he
is
present
himself
and
listening
and
he
is
aware
in
his
own
heart
whether
i
swear
falsely
and
what
will
surprise
you
the
more
i
can
swear
besides
that
i
have
not
received
even
what
the
other
generals
have
received
no
nor
yet
what
some
of
the
officers
have
received
but
how
so
why
have
i
managed
my
affairs
no
better
i
thought
sirs
the
more
i
helped
him
to
bear
his
poverty
at
the
time
the
more
i
should
make
him
my
friend
in
the
day
of
his
power
whereas
it
is
just
when
i
see
the
star
of
his
good
fortune
rising
that
i
have
come
to
divine
the
secret
of
his
character
some
one
may
say
are
you
not
ashamed
to
be
so
taken
in
like
a
fool
yes
i
should
be
ashamed
if
it
had
been
an
open
enemy
who
had
so
deceived
me
but
to
my
mind
when
friend
cheats
friend
a
deeper
stain
attaches
to
the
perpetrator
than
to
the
victim
of
deceit
whatever
precaution
a
man
may
take
against
his
friend
that
we
took
in
full
we
certainly
gave
him
no
pretext
for
refusing
to
pay
us
what
he
promised
we
were
perfectly
upright
in
our
dealings
with
him
we
did
not
dawdle
over
his
affairs
nor
did
we
shrink
from
any
work
to
which
he
challenged
us
but
you
will
say
i
ought
to
have
taken
security
of
him
at
the
time
so
that
had
he
fostered
the
wish
he
might
have
lacked
the
ability
to
deceive
to
meet
that
retort
i
must
beg
you
to
listen
to
certain
things
which
i
should
never
have
said
in
his
presence
except
for
your
utter
want
of
feeling
towards
me
or
your
extraordinary
ingratitude
try
and
recall
the
posture
of
your
affairs
when
i
extricated
you
and
brought
you
to
seuthes
do
you
not
recollect
how
at
perinthus
aristarchus
shut
the
gates
in
your
faces
each
time
you
offered
to
approach
the
town
and
how
you
were
driven
to
camp
outside
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
it
was
midwinter
you
were
thrown
upon
the
resources
of
a
market
wherein
few
were
the
articles
offered
for
sale
and
scanty
the
wherewithal
to
purchase
them
yet
stay
in
thrace
you
must
for
there
were
ships
of
war
riding
at
anchor
in
the
bay
ready
to
hinder
your
passage
across
and
what
did
that
stay
imply
it
meant
being
in
a
hostile
country
confronted
by
countless
cavalry
legions
of
light
infantry
and
what
had
we
a
heavy
infantry
force
certainly
with
which
we
could
have
dashed
at
villages
in
a
body
possibly
and
seized
a
modicum
of
food
at
most
but
as
to
pursuing
the
enemy
with
such
a
force
as
ours
or
capturing
men
or
cattle
the
thing
was
out
of
the
question
for
when
i
rejoined
you
your
original
cavalry
and
light
infantry
divisions
had
disappeared
in
such
sore
straits
you
lay
supposing
that
without
making
any
demands
for
pay
whatever
i
had
merely
won
for
you
the
alliance
of
seuthes
whose
cavalry
and
light
infantry
were
just
what
you
needed
would
you
not
have
thought
that
i
had
planned
very
well
for
you
i
presume
it
was
through
your
partnership
with
him
and
his
that
you
were
able
to
find
such
complete
stores
of
corn
in
the
villages
when
the
thracians
were
driven
to
take
to
their
heels
in
such
hot
haste
and
you
had
so
large
a
share
of
captives
and
cattle
why
from
the
day
on
which
his
cavalry
force
was
attached
to
us
we
never
set
eyes
on
a
single
foeman
in
the
field
though
up
to
that
date
the
enemy
with
his
cavalry
and
his
light
infantry
used
undauntedly
to
hang
on
our
heels
and
effectually
prevented
us
from
scattering
in
small
bodies
and
reaping
a
rich
harvest
of
provisions
but
if
he
who
partly
gave
you
this
security
has
failed
to
pay
in
full
the
wages
due
to
you
therefrom
is
not
that
a
terrible
misfortune
so
monstrous
indeed
that
you
think
i
ought
not
to
go
forth
alive
the
fate
of
a
is
too
good
for
me
but
let
me
ask
you
in
what
condition
do
you
turn
your
backs
on
this
land
have
you
not
wintered
here
in
the
lap
of
plenty
whatever
you
have
got
from
seuthes
has
been
surplus
gain
your
enemies
have
had
to
meet
the
bill
of
your
expenses
whilst
you
led
a
merry
round
of
existence
in
which
you
have
not
once
set
eyes
on
the
dead
body
of
a
comrade
or
lost
one
living
man
again
if
you
have
achieved
any
or
rather
many
noble
deeds
against
the
asiatic
barbarian
you
have
them
safe
and
in
addition
to
these
you
have
won
for
yourselves
a
second
glory
you
undertook
a
campaign
against
the
european
thracians
and
have
mastered
them
what
i
say
then
is
that
these
very
matters
which
you
make
a
ground
of
quarrel
against
myself
are
rather
blessings
for
which
you
ought
to
show
gratitude
to
heaven
thus
far
i
have
confined
myself
to
your
side
of
the
matter
bear
with
me
i
beg
you
while
we
examine
mine
when
i
first
essayed
to
part
with
you
and
journey
homewards
i
was
doubly
blest
from
your
lips
i
had
won
some
praise
and
thanks
to
you
i
had
obtained
glory
from
the
rest
of
hellas
i
was
trusted
by
the
lacedaemonians
else
would
they
not
have
sent
me
back
to
you
whereas
i
turn
to
go
calumniated
before
the
lacedaemonians
by
yourselves
detested
in
your
behalf
by
seuthes
whom
i
meant
so
to
benefit
by
help
of
you
that
i
should
find
in
him
a
refuge
for
myself
and
for
my
children
if
children
i
might
have
in
after
time
and
you
the
while
for
whose
sake
i
have
incurred
so
much
hate
the
hate
of
people
far
superior
to
me
in
strength
you
for
whom
i
have
not
yet
ceased
to
devise
all
the
good
i
can
entertain
such
sentiments
about
me
why
i
am
no
renegade
or
runaway
slave
you
have
got
hold
of
if
you
carry
out
what
you
say
be
sure
you
will
have
done
to
death
a
man
who
has
passed
many
a
vigil
in
watching
over
you
who
has
shared
with
you
many
a
toil
and
run
many
a
risk
in
turn
and
out
of
turn
who
thanks
to
the
gracious
gods
has
by
your
side
set
up
full
many
a
trophy
over
the
barbarian
who
lastly
has
strained
every
nerve
in
his
body
to
protect
you
against
yourselves
and
so
it
is
that
you
can
move
freely
where
you
choose
by
sea
or
by
land
and
no
one
can
say
you
nay
and
you
on
whom
this
large
liberty
dawns
who
are
sailing
to
a
long
desired
goal
who
are
sought
after
by
the
greatest
of
military
powers
who
have
pay
in
prospect
and
for
leaders
these
lacedaemonians
our
acknowledged
chiefs
now
is
the
appointed
time
you
think
to
put
me
to
a
speedy
death
but
in
the
days
of
our
difficulties
it
was
very
different
o
ye
men
of
marvellous
memory
no
in
those
days
you
called
me
and
you
promised
you
would
bear
me
ever
in
mind
benefactor
not
so
however
not
so
ungracious
are
those
who
have
come
to
you
nor
if
i
mistake
not
have
you
bettered
yourselves
in
their
eyes
by
your
treatment
of
me
with
these
words
he
paused
and
charminus
the
lacedaemonian
got
up
and
said
nay
by
the
twins
you
are
wrong
surely
in
your
anger
against
this
man
i
myself
can
bear
testimony
in
his
favour
when
polynicus
and
i
asked
seuthes
what
sort
of
a
man
he
was
seuthes
answered
he
had
but
one
fault
to
find
with
him
that
he
was
too
much
the
friend
which
also
was
the
cause
why
things
went
wrong
with
him
whether
as
regards
us
lacedaemonians
or
himself
seuthes
upon
that
eurylochus
of
lusia
an
arcadian
got
up
and
said
addressing
the
two
lacedaemonians
yes
sirs
and
what
strikes
me
is
that
you
can
not
begin
your
generalship
of
us
better
than
by
exacting
from
seuthes
our
pay
whether
he
like
it
or
no
let
him
pay
in
full
and
do
not
take
us
away
before
polycrates
the
athenian
who
was
put
forward
by
xenophon
said
if
my
eyes
do
not
deceive
me
sirs
there
stands
heracleides
yonder
the
man
who
received
the
property
won
by
our
toil
who
took
and
sold
it
and
never
gave
back
either
to
seuthes
or
to
us
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
but
kept
the
money
to
himself
like
the
thief
he
is
if
we
are
wise
we
will
lay
hold
of
him
for
he
is
no
thracian
but
a
hellene
and
against
hellenes
is
the
wrong
he
has
committed
when
heracleides
heard
these
words
he
was
in
great
consternation
so
he
came
to
seuthes
and
said
if
we
are
wise
we
will
get
away
from
here
out
of
reach
of
these
fellows
so
they
mounted
their
horses
and
were
gone
in
a
trice
galloping
to
their
own
camp
subsequently
seuthes
sent
abrozelmes
his
private
interpreter
to
xenophon
begging
him
to
stay
behind
with
one
thousand
heavy
troops
and
engaging
duly
to
deliver
to
him
the
places
on
the
seaboard
and
the
other
things
which
he
had
promised
and
then
as
a
great
secret
he
told
him
that
he
had
heard
from
polynicus
that
if
he
once
got
into
the
clutches
of
the
lacedaemonians
thibron
was
certain
to
put
him
to
death
similar
messages
kept
coming
to
xenophon
by
letter
or
otherwise
from
several
quarters
warning
him
that
he
was
calumniated
and
had
best
be
on
his
guard
hearing
which
he
took
two
victims
and
sacrificed
to
zeus
the
king
whether
it
were
better
and
happier
to
stay
with
seuthes
on
the
terms
proposed
or
depart
with
the
army
the
answer
he
received
was
depart
vii
after
this
seuthes
removed
his
camp
to
some
considerable
distance
and
the
hellenes
took
up
their
quarters
in
some
villages
selecting
those
in
which
they
could
best
supply
their
commissariat
on
the
road
to
the
sea
now
these
particular
villages
had
been
given
by
seuthes
to
medosades
accordingly
when
the
latter
saw
his
property
in
the
villages
being
expended
by
the
hellenes
he
was
not
over
well
pleased
and
taking
with
him
an
odrysian
a
powerful
person
amongst
those
who
had
come
down
from
the
interior
and
about
thirty
mounted
troopers
he
came
and
challenged
xenophon
to
come
forth
from
the
hellenic
host
he
taking
some
of
the
officers
and
others
of
a
character
to
be
relied
upon
came
forward
then
medosades
addressing
xenophon
said
you
are
doing
wrong
to
pillage
our
villages
we
give
you
fair
warning
i
in
behalf
of
seuthes
and
this
man
by
my
side
who
comes
from
medocus
the
king
up
country
to
begone
out
of
the
land
if
you
refuse
understand
we
have
no
notion
of
handing
it
over
to
you
but
if
you
injure
our
country
we
will
retaliate
upon
you
as
foes
xenophon
hearing
what
they
had
to
say
replied
such
language
addressed
to
us
by
you
of
all
people
is
hard
to
answer
yet
for
the
sake
of
the
young
man
with
you
i
will
attempt
to
do
so
that
at
least
he
may
learn
how
different
your
nature
is
from
ours
we
he
continued
before
we
were
your
friends
had
the
free
run
of
this
country
moving
this
way
or
that
as
it
took
our
fancy
pillaging
and
burning
just
as
we
chose
and
you
yourself
medosades
whenever
you
came
to
us
on
an
embassy
camped
with
us
without
apprehension
of
any
foe
as
a
tribe
collectively
you
scarcely
approached
the
country
at
all
or
if
you
found
yourselves
in
it
you
bivouacked
with
your
horses
bitted
and
bridled
as
being
in
the
territory
of
your
superiors
presently
you
made
friends
with
us
and
thanks
to
us
by
god
help
you
have
won
this
country
out
of
which
you
seek
to
drive
us
a
country
which
we
held
by
our
own
strength
and
gave
to
you
no
hostile
force
as
you
well
know
was
capable
of
expelling
us
it
might
have
been
expected
of
you
personally
to
speed
us
on
our
way
with
some
gift
in
return
for
the
good
we
did
you
not
so
even
though
our
backs
are
turned
to
go
we
are
too
slow
in
our
movements
for
you
you
will
not
suffer
us
to
take
up
quarters
even
if
you
can
help
it
and
these
words
arouse
no
shame
in
you
either
before
the
gods
or
this
odrysian
in
whose
eyes
you
are
man
of
means
though
until
you
cultivated
our
friendship
you
lived
a
robber
life
as
you
have
told
us
however
why
do
you
address
yourself
to
me
i
am
no
longer
in
command
our
generals
are
the
lacedaemonians
to
whom
you
and
yours
delivered
the
army
for
withdrawal
and
that
without
even
inviting
me
to
attend
you
most
marvellous
of
men
so
that
if
i
lost
their
favour
when
i
brought
you
the
troops
i
might
now
win
their
gratitude
by
restoring
them
as
soon
as
the
odrysian
had
heard
this
statement
he
exclaimed
for
my
part
medosades
i
sink
under
the
earth
for
very
shame
at
what
i
hear
if
i
had
known
the
truth
before
i
would
never
have
accompanied
you
as
it
is
i
return
at
once
never
would
king
medocus
applaud
me
if
i
drove
forth
his
benefactors
with
these
words
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
and
with
him
the
rest
of
his
horsemen
except
four
or
five
but
medosades
still
vexed
by
the
pillaging
of
the
country
urged
xenophon
to
summon
the
two
lacedaemonians
and
he
taking
the
pick
of
his
men
came
to
charminus
and
polynicus
and
informed
them
that
they
were
summoned
by
medosades
probably
they
like
himself
would
be
warned
to
leave
the
country
if
so
he
added
you
will
be
able
to
recover
the
pay
which
is
owing
to
the
army
you
can
say
to
them
that
the
army
has
requested
you
to
assist
in
exacting
their
pay
from
seuthes
whether
he
like
it
or
not
that
they
have
promised
as
soon
as
they
get
this
cheerfully
to
follow
you
that
the
demand
seems
to
you
to
be
only
just
and
that
you
have
accordingly
promised
not
to
leave
until
the
soldiers
have
got
their
dues
the
lacedaemonians
accepted
the
suggestion
they
would
apply
these
arguments
and
others
the
most
forcible
they
could
hit
upon
and
with
the
proper
representatives
of
the
army
they
immediately
set
off
on
their
arrival
charminus
spoke
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
us
medosades
say
it
but
if
not
we
have
something
to
say
to
you
and
medosades
submissively
made
answer
i
say
said
he
and
seuthes
says
the
same
we
think
we
have
a
right
to
ask
that
those
who
have
become
our
friends
should
not
be
by
you
whatever
ill
you
do
to
them
you
really
do
to
us
for
they
are
a
part
of
us
good
replied
the
lacedaemonians
and
we
intend
to
go
away
as
soon
as
those
who
won
for
you
the
people
and
the
territory
in
question
have
got
their
pay
failing
that
we
are
coming
without
further
delay
to
assist
them
and
to
punish
certain
others
who
have
broken
their
oaths
and
done
them
wrong
if
it
should
turn
out
that
you
come
under
this
head
when
we
come
to
exact
justice
we
shall
begin
with
you
xenophon
added
would
you
prefer
medosades
to
leave
it
to
these
people
themselves
in
whose
country
we
are
your
friends
since
this
is
the
designation
you
prefer
to
decide
by
ballot
which
of
the
two
should
leave
the
country
you
or
we
to
that
proposal
he
shook
his
head
but
he
trusted
the
two
laconians
might
be
induced
to
go
to
seuthes
about
the
pay
adding
seuthes
i
am
sure
will
lend
a
willing
ear
or
if
they
could
not
go
then
he
prayed
them
to
send
xenophon
with
himself
promising
to
lend
the
latter
all
the
aid
in
his
power
and
finally
he
begged
them
not
to
burn
the
villages
accordingly
they
sent
xenophon
and
with
him
a
serviceable
staff
being
arrived
he
addressed
seuthes
thus
seuthes
i
am
here
to
advance
no
claims
but
to
show
you
if
i
can
how
unjust
it
was
on
your
part
to
be
angered
with
me
because
i
zealously
demanded
of
you
on
behalf
of
the
soldiers
what
you
promised
them
according
to
my
belief
it
was
no
less
to
your
interest
to
deliver
it
up
than
it
was
to
theirs
to
receive
it
i
can
not
forget
that
next
to
the
gods
it
was
they
who
raised
you
up
to
a
conspicuous
eminence
when
they
made
you
king
of
large
territory
and
many
men
a
position
in
which
you
can
not
escape
notice
whether
you
do
good
or
do
evil
for
a
man
so
circumstanced
i
regarded
it
as
a
great
thing
that
he
should
avoid
the
suspicion
even
of
ungrateful
parting
with
his
benefactors
it
was
a
great
thing
i
thought
that
you
should
be
well
spoken
of
by
six
thousand
human
beings
but
the
greatest
thing
of
all
that
you
should
in
no
wise
discredit
the
sincerity
of
your
own
word
for
what
of
the
man
who
can
not
be
trusted
i
see
that
the
words
of
his
mouth
are
but
vain
words
powerless
and
unhonoured
but
with
him
who
is
seen
to
regard
truth
the
case
is
otherwise
he
can
achieve
by
his
words
what
another
achieves
by
force
if
he
seeks
to
bring
the
foolish
to
their
senses
his
very
frown
i
perceive
has
a
more
sobering
effect
than
the
chastisement
inflicted
by
another
or
in
negotiations
the
very
promises
of
such
an
one
are
of
equal
weight
with
the
gifts
of
another
try
and
recall
to
mind
in
your
own
case
what
advance
of
money
you
made
to
us
to
purchase
our
alliance
you
know
you
did
not
advance
one
penny
it
was
simply
confidence
in
the
sincerity
of
your
word
which
incited
all
these
men
to
assist
you
in
your
campaign
and
so
to
acquire
for
you
an
empire
worth
many
times
more
than
thirty
talents
which
is
all
they
now
claim
to
receive
here
then
first
of
all
goes
the
credit
which
won
for
you
your
kingdom
sold
for
so
mean
a
sum
let
me
remind
you
of
the
great
importance
which
you
then
attached
to
the
acquisition
of
your
present
conquests
i
am
certain
that
to
achieve
what
stands
achieved
you
would
willingly
have
foregone
the
gain
of
fifty
times
that
paltry
sum
to
me
it
seems
that
to
lose
your
present
fortune
were
a
more
serious
loss
than
never
to
have
won
it
since
surely
it
is
harder
to
be
poor
after
being
rich
than
never
to
have
tasted
wealth
at
all
and
more
painful
to
sink
to
the
level
of
a
subject
being
a
king
then
never
to
have
worn
a
crown
you
can
not
forget
that
your
present
vassals
were
not
persuaded
to
become
your
subjects
out
of
love
for
you
but
by
sheer
force
and
but
for
some
restraining
dread
they
would
endeavour
to
be
free
again
and
how
do
you
propose
to
stimulate
their
sense
of
awe
and
keep
them
in
good
behaviour
towards
you
shall
they
see
our
soldiers
so
disposed
towards
you
that
a
word
on
your
part
would
suffice
to
keep
them
now
or
if
necessary
would
bring
them
back
again
while
others
hearing
from
us
a
hundred
stories
in
your
praise
hasten
to
present
themselves
at
your
desire
or
will
you
drive
them
to
conclude
adversely
that
through
mistrust
of
what
has
happened
now
no
second
set
of
soldiers
will
come
to
help
you
for
even
these
troops
of
ours
are
more
their
friends
than
yours
and
indeed
it
was
not
because
they
fell
short
of
us
in
numbers
that
they
became
your
subjects
but
from
lack
of
proper
leaders
there
is
a
danger
therefore
now
lest
they
should
choose
as
their
protectors
some
of
us
who
regard
ourselves
as
wronged
by
you
or
even
better
men
than
us
the
lacedaemonians
themselves
supposing
our
soldiers
undertake
to
serve
with
more
enthusiasm
if
the
debt
you
owe
to
them
be
first
exacted
and
the
lacedaemonians
who
need
their
services
consent
to
this
request
it
is
plain
at
any
rate
that
the
thracians
now
prostrate
at
your
feet
would
display
far
more
enthusiasm
in
attacking
than
in
assisting
you
for
your
mastery
means
their
slavery
and
your
defeat
their
liberty
again
the
country
is
now
yours
and
from
this
time
forward
you
have
to
make
provision
for
what
is
yours
and
how
will
you
best
secure
it
an
immunity
from
ill
either
these
soldiers
receive
their
dues
and
go
leaving
a
legacy
of
peace
behind
or
they
stay
and
occupy
an
country
whilst
you
endeavour
by
aid
of
a
still
larger
army
to
open
a
new
campaign
and
turn
them
out
and
your
new
troops
will
also
need
provisions
or
again
which
will
be
the
greater
drain
on
your
purse
to
pay
off
your
present
debt
or
with
that
still
owing
to
bid
for
more
troops
and
of
a
better
quality
heracleides
as
he
used
to
prove
to
me
finds
the
sum
excessive
but
surely
it
is
a
far
less
serious
thing
for
you
to
take
and
pay
it
back
than
it
would
have
been
to
pay
the
tithe
of
it
before
we
came
to
you
since
the
limit
between
less
and
more
is
no
fixed
number
but
depends
on
the
relative
capacity
of
payer
and
recipient
and
your
yearly
income
now
is
larger
than
the
whole
property
which
you
possessed
in
earlier
days
well
seuthes
for
myself
these
remarks
are
the
expression
of
friendly
forethought
for
a
friend
they
are
expressed
in
the
double
hope
that
you
may
show
yourself
worthy
of
the
good
things
which
the
gods
have
given
you
and
that
my
reputation
may
not
be
ruined
with
the
army
for
i
must
assure
you
that
if
i
wished
to
injure
a
foe
i
could
not
do
so
with
this
army
nor
again
if
i
wished
to
come
and
help
you
should
i
be
competent
to
the
task
such
is
the
disposition
of
the
troops
towards
me
and
yet
i
call
you
to
witness
along
with
the
gods
who
know
that
never
have
i
received
anything
from
you
on
account
of
the
soldiers
never
to
this
day
have
i
to
my
private
gain
asked
for
what
was
theirs
nor
even
claimed
the
promises
which
were
made
to
myself
and
i
swear
to
you
not
even
had
you
proposed
to
pay
me
my
dues
would
i
have
accepted
them
unless
the
soldiers
also
had
been
going
to
receive
theirs
too
how
could
i
how
shameful
it
would
have
been
in
me
so
to
have
secured
my
own
interests
whilst
i
disregarded
the
disastrous
state
of
theirs
i
being
so
honoured
by
them
of
course
to
the
mind
of
heracleides
this
is
all
silly
talk
since
the
one
great
object
is
to
keep
money
by
whatever
means
that
is
not
my
tenet
seuthes
i
believe
that
no
fairer
or
brighter
jewel
can
be
given
to
a
man
and
most
of
all
a
prince
than
the
threefold
grace
of
valour
justice
and
generosity
he
that
possesses
these
is
rich
in
the
multitude
of
friends
which
surround
him
rich
also
in
the
desire
of
others
to
be
included
in
their
number
while
he
prospers
he
is
surrounded
by
those
who
will
rejoice
with
him
in
his
joy
or
if
misfortune
overtake
him
he
has
no
lack
of
sympathisers
to
give
him
help
however
if
you
have
failed
to
learn
from
my
deeds
that
i
was
heart
and
soul
your
friend
if
my
words
are
powerless
to
reveal
the
fact
i
would
at
least
direct
your
attention
to
what
the
soldiers
said
you
were
standing
by
and
heard
what
those
who
sought
to
blame
me
said
they
accused
me
to
the
lacedaemonians
and
the
point
of
their
indictment
was
that
i
set
greater
store
by
yourself
than
by
the
lacedaemonians
but
as
regards
themselves
the
charge
was
that
i
took
more
pains
to
secure
the
success
of
your
interests
than
their
own
they
suggested
that
i
had
actually
taken
gifts
from
you
was
it
do
you
suppose
because
they
detected
some
in
me
towards
you
that
they
made
the
allegation
was
it
not
rather
that
they
had
noticed
my
abundant
zeal
on
your
behalf
all
men
believe
i
think
that
a
fund
of
kindly
feeling
is
due
to
him
from
whom
we
accept
gifts
but
what
is
your
behaviour
before
i
had
ministered
to
you
in
any
way
or
done
you
a
single
service
you
welcomed
me
kindly
with
your
eyes
your
voice
your
hospitality
and
you
could
not
sate
yourself
with
promises
of
all
the
fine
things
that
were
to
follow
but
having
once
achieved
your
object
and
become
the
great
man
you
now
are
as
great
indeed
as
i
could
make
you
you
can
stand
by
and
see
me
degraded
among
my
own
soldiers
well
time
will
teach
you
that
i
fully
believe
to
pay
whatever
seems
to
you
right
and
even
without
the
lessons
of
that
teacher
you
will
hardly
care
to
see
whose
who
have
spent
themselves
in
benefiting
you
become
your
accusers
only
when
you
do
pay
your
debt
i
beg
of
you
to
use
your
best
endeavour
to
right
me
with
the
soldiers
leave
me
at
least
where
you
found
me
that
is
all
i
ask
after
listening
to
this
appeal
seuthes
called
down
curses
on
him
whose
fault
it
was
that
the
debt
had
not
long
ago
been
paid
and
if
the
general
suspicion
was
correct
this
was
heracleides
for
myself
said
seuthes
i
never
had
any
idea
of
robbing
you
of
your
just
dues
i
will
repay
then
xenophon
rejoined
since
you
are
minded
to
pay
i
only
ask
that
you
will
do
so
through
me
and
will
not
suffer
me
on
your
account
to
hold
a
different
position
in
the
army
from
what
i
held
when
we
joined
you
he
replied
as
far
as
that
goes
so
far
from
holding
a
less
honoured
position
among
your
own
men
on
my
account
if
you
will
stay
with
me
keeping
only
a
thousand
heavy
infantry
i
will
deliver
to
you
the
fortified
places
and
everything
i
promised
the
other
answered
on
these
terms
i
may
not
accept
them
only
let
us
go
free
nay
but
i
know
said
seuthes
that
it
is
safer
for
you
to
bide
with
me
than
to
go
away
then
xenophon
again
for
your
forethought
i
thank
you
but
i
may
not
stay
somewhere
i
may
rise
to
honour
and
that
be
sure
shall
redound
to
your
gain
also
thereupon
seuthes
spoke
of
silver
i
have
but
little
that
little
however
i
give
to
you
one
talent
but
of
beeves
i
can
give
you
six
hundred
head
and
of
sheep
four
thousand
and
of
slaves
six
score
these
take
and
the
hostages
besides
who
wronged
you
and
begone
xenophon
laughed
and
said
but
supposing
these
all
together
do
not
amount
to
the
pay
for
whom
is
the
talent
shall
i
say
it
is
a
little
dangerous
for
myself
is
it
not
i
think
i
had
better
be
on
the
for
stones
when
i
return
you
heard
the
threats
so
for
the
moment
he
stayed
there
but
the
next
day
seuthes
gave
up
to
them
what
he
had
promised
and
sent
an
escort
to
drive
the
cattle
the
soldiers
at
first
maintained
that
xenophon
had
gone
to
take
up
his
abode
with
seuthes
and
to
receive
what
he
had
been
promised
so
when
they
saw
him
they
were
pleased
and
ran
to
meet
him
and
xenophon
seeing
charminus
and
polynicus
said
thanks
to
your
intervention
this
much
has
been
saved
for
the
army
my
duty
is
to
deliver
this
fraction
over
to
your
keeping
do
you
divide
and
distribute
it
to
the
soldiers
accordingly
they
took
the
property
and
appointed
official
vendors
of
the
booty
and
in
the
end
incurred
considerable
blame
xenophon
held
aloof
in
fact
it
was
no
secret
that
he
was
making
his
preparations
to
return
home
for
as
yet
the
vote
of
banishment
had
not
been
passed
at
athens
but
the
authorities
in
the
camp
came
to
him
and
begged
him
not
to
go
away
until
he
had
conducted
the
army
to
its
destination
and
handed
it
over
to
thibron
at
this
moment
the
vote
of
banishment
had
not
been
passed
which
would
prevent
his
return
to
athens
the
natural
inference
from
these
words
is
i
think
that
the
vote
of
banishment
was
presently
passed
at
any
rate
considerably
earlier
than
the
battle
of
coronea
in
five
years
and
a
half
afterwards
viii
from
this
place
they
sailed
across
to
lampsacus
and
here
xenophon
was
met
by
eucleides
the
soothsayer
a
phliasian
the
son
of
cleagoras
who
painted
the
dreams
in
the
lycium
eucleides
congratulated
xenophon
upon
his
safe
return
and
asked
him
how
much
gold
he
had
got
and
xenophon
had
to
confess
upon
my
word
i
shall
have
barely
enough
to
get
home
unless
i
sell
my
horse
and
what
i
have
about
my
person
the
other
could
not
credit
the
statement
now
when
the
lampsacenes
sent
gifts
of
hospitality
to
xenophon
and
he
was
sacrificing
to
apollo
he
requested
the
presence
of
eucleides
and
the
latter
seeing
the
victims
said
now
i
believe
what
you
said
about
having
no
money
but
i
am
certain
he
continued
if
it
were
ever
to
come
there
is
an
obstacle
in
the
way
if
nothing
else
you
are
that
obstacle
yourself
xenophon
admitted
the
force
of
that
remark
then
the
other
zeus
meilichios
is
an
obstacle
to
you
i
am
sure
adding
in
another
tone
of
voice
have
you
tried
sacrificing
to
that
god
as
i
was
wont
to
sacrifice
and
offer
whole
burnt
offerings
for
you
at
home
xenophon
replied
that
since
he
had
been
abroad
he
had
not
sacrificed
to
that
god
accordingly
eucleides
counselled
him
to
sacrifice
in
the
old
customary
way
he
was
sure
that
his
fortune
would
improve
the
next
day
xenophon
went
on
to
ophrynium
and
sacrificed
offering
a
holocaust
of
swine
after
the
custom
of
his
family
and
the
signs
which
he
obtained
were
favourable
that
very
day
bion
and
nausicleides
arrived
laden
with
gifts
for
the
army
these
two
were
hospitably
entertained
by
xenophon
and
were
kind
enough
to
repurchase
the
horse
he
had
sold
in
lampsacus
for
fifty
darics
suspecting
that
he
had
parted
with
it
out
of
need
and
hearing
that
he
was
fond
of
the
beast
they
restored
it
to
him
refusing
to
be
remunerated

said
that

victims
were

could
be

would
be
an
easy
prey

after

he
set
off

repelled
them
they
had
no

through

the
hole
and
the
rest
discharged
their
arrows
so
hotly
that
it
was
dangerous
to
come
anywhere
near
the
passage
and
what
with
their
shouting
and
kindling
of
beacon
fires
a
relief
party
at
length
arrived
consisting
of
itabelius
at
the
head
of
his
force
and
a
body
of
assyrian
heavy
infantry
from
comania
and
some
hyrcanian
cavalry
the
latter
also
being
mercenaries
of
the
king
there
were
eighty
of
them
and
another
detachment
of
light
troops
about
eight
hundred
and
more
from
parthenium
and
more
again
from
apollonia
and
the
neighbouring
places
also
cavalry
the
hyrcanian
cavalry
play
an
important
part
in
the
cyropaedeia
they
are
the
scirites
of
the
assyrian
army
who
came
over
to
cyrus
after
the
first
battle
their
country
is
the
fertile
land
touching
the
corner
of
the
caspian
cf
cyrop
iv
ii
where
the
author
or
an
editor
appends
a
note
on
the
present
status
of
the
hyrcanians
it
was
now
high
time
to
consider
how
they
were
to
beat
a
retreat
so
seizing
all
the
cattle
and
sheep
to
be
had
with
the
slaves
they
put
them
within
a
hollow
square
and
proceed
to
drive
them
off
not
that
they
had
a
thought
to
give
to
the
spoils
now
but
for
sake
and
for
fear
lest
if
they
left
the
goods
and
chattels
behind
and
made
off
the
retreat
would
rapidly
degenerate
into
a
stampede
the
enemy
growing
bolder
as
the
troops
lost
heart
for
the
present
then
they
retired
as
if
they
meant
to
do
battle
for
the
spoils
as
soon
as
gongylus
espied
how
few
the
hellenes
were
and
how
large
the
attacking
party
out
he
came
himself
in
spite
of
his
mother
with
his
private
force
wishing
to
share
in
the
action
another
too
joined
in
the
rescue
procles
from
halisarna
and
teuthrania
a
descendant
of
damaratus
by
this
time
xenophon
and
his
men
were
being
sore
pressed
by
the
arrows
and
slingstones
though
they
marched
in
a
curve
so
as
to
keep
their
shields
facing
the
missiles
and
even
so
barely
crossed
the
river
carcasus
nearly
half
of
them
wounded
here
it
was
that
agasias
the
stymphalian
the
captain
received
his
wound
while
keeping
up
a
steady
unflagging
fight
against
the
enemy
from
beginning
to
end
and
so
they
reached
home
in
safety
with
about
two
hundred
captives
and
sheep
enough
for
sacrifices
the
next
day
xenophon
sacrificed
and
led
out
the
whole
army
under
the
cover
of
night
intending
to
pierce
far
into
the
heart
of
lydia
with
a
view
to
lulling
to
sleep
the
enemy
alarm
at
his
proxmity
and
so
in
fact
to
put
him
off
his
guard
but
asidates
hearing
that
xenophon
had
again
sacrificed
with
the
intention
of
another
attack
and
was
approaching
with
his
whole
army
left
his
tower
and
took
up
quarters
in
some
villages
lying
under
the
town
of
parthenium
here
party
fell
in
with
him
and
took
him
prisoner
with
his
wife
his
children
his
horses
and
all
that
he
had
and
so
the
promise
of
the
earlier
victims
was
literally
fulfilled
after
that
they
returned
again
to
pergamus
and
here
xenophon
might
well
thank
god
with
a
warm
heart
for
the
laconians
the
officers
the
other
generals
and
the
soldiers
as
a
body
united
to
give
him
the
pick
of
horses
and
cattle
teams
and
the
rest
so
that
he
was
now
in
a
position
himself
to
do
another
a
good
turn
meanwhile
thibron
arrived
and
received
the
troops
which
he
incorporated
with
the
rest
of
his
hellenic
forces
and
so
proceeded
to
prosecute
a
war
against
tissaphernes
and
pharnabazus
