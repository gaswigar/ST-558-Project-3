an
impossible

howard
frayberg
production
director
of
your

was
a
man
of
sudden
unpredictable
moods
and
sam
catlin
the
show
continuity
editor
had
learned
to
expect
the
worst
sam
said
frayberg
regarding
the
show
last
night
he
paused
to
seek
the
proper
words
and
catlin
relaxed
frayberg
frame
of
mind
was
merely
critical
sam
we
in
a
rut
what
worse
the
show
dull
sam
catlin
shrugged
not
committing
himself
processors
of
alphard
who
cares
about
seaweed
it
factual
stuff
said
sam
defensive
but
not
wanting
to
go
too
far
out
on
a
limb
we
bring
everything
color
fact
romance
sight
sound
smell
next
week
it
the
ball
expedition
to
the
mixtup
mountains
on
gropus
frayberg
leaned
forward
sam
we
working
the
wrong
slant
on
this
stuff
we
got
to
loosen
up
sock
shift
our
ground
give
the
old
human
angle
glamor
mystery
thrills
sam
catlin
curled
his
lips
i
got
just
what
you
want
yeah
show
me
catlin
reached
into
his
waste
basket
i
filed
this
just
ten
minutes
ago
he
smoothed
out
the
pages
idea
by
wilbur
murphy
investigate
horseman
of
space
the
man
who
rides
up
to
meet
incoming
frayberg
tilted
his
head
to
the
side
rides
up
on
a
that
what
wilbur
murphy
says
how
far
up
does
it
make
any
difference
no
i
guess
not
well
for
your
information
it
up
ten
thousand
twenty
thousand
miles
he
waves
to
the
pilot
takes
off
his
hat
to
the
passengers
then
rides
back
down
and
where
does
all
this
take
place
on
on
catlin
frowned
i
can
write
it
but
i
ca
pronounce
it
he
printed
on
his
cirgamesç
sirgamesk
read
frayberg
catlin
shook
his
head
that
what
it
looks
like
but
those
consonants
are
all
aspirated
gutturals
it
more
like
where
did
murphy
get
this
tip
i
did
bother
to
ask
well
mused
frayberg
we
could
always
do
a
show
on
strange
superstitions
is
murphy
around
he
explaining
his
expense
account
to
shifkin
get
him
in
here
let
talk
to
him
wilbur
murphy
had
a
blond
a
broad
freckled
nose
and
a
serious
sidelong
squint
he
looked
from
his
crumpled
sequence
idea
to
catlin
and
frayberg
did
like
it
eh
we
thought
the
emphasis
should
be
a
little
different
explained
catlin
instead
of
space
horseman
we
give
it
the
working
title
superstitions
of
hrrghameshgrrh
oh
hell
said
frayberg
call
it
sirgamesk
anyway
said
catlin
that
the
angle
but
it
not
superstition
said
murphy
oh
come
wilbur
i
got
this
for
sheer
fact
a
man
rides
a
horse
up
to
meet
the
incoming
ships
where
did
you
get
this
wild
fable
my
is
purser
on
the
at
planet
they
make
connection
with
the
feeder
line
out
of
cirgamesç
wait
a
minute
said
catlin
how
did
you
pronounce
that
cirgamesç
the
steward
on
the
gave
out
this
story
and
my
passed
it
along
to
me
somebody
pulling
somebody
leg
my
was
and
the
steward
was
cold
sober
they
been
eating
sirgamesk
is
a
javanese
planet
is
it
javanese
arab
malay
then
they
took
a
supply
with
them
and
and
a
few
other
sociable
herbs
well
this
horseman
is
any
no
what
is
it
so
far
as
i
know
it
a
man
on
a
horse
ten
thousand
miles
up
in
a
vacuum
exactly
no
that
the
story
catlin
and
frayberg
looked
at
each
other
well
wilbur
catlin
began
frayberg
interrupted
what
we
can
use
wilbur
is
a
sequence
on
sirgamesk
superstition
emphasis
on
voodoo
or
witchcraft
naked
girls
dancing
stuff
with
roots
in
earth
but
now
typically
sirgamesk
lots
of
color
secret
rite
stuff
not
much
room
on
cirgamesç
for
secret
rites
it
a
big
planet
is
it
not
quite
as
big
as
mars
there
no
atmosphere
the
settlers
live
in
mountain
valleys
with
lids
over
catlin
flipped
the
pages
of
sketches
of
the
inhabited
says
here
there
ancient
ruins
millions
of
years
old
when
the
atmosphere
went
the
population
went
with
it
frayberg
became
animated
there
lots
of
material
out
there
go
get
it
wilbur
life
sex
excitement
mystery
okay
said
wilbur
murphy
but
lay
off
this
there
a
limit
to
public
credulity
and
do
you
let
anyone
tell
you
different
cirgamesç
hung
outside
the
port
twenty
thousand
miles
ahead
the
steward
leaned
over
wilbur
murphy
shoulder
and
pointed
a
long
brown
finger
it
was
right
out
there
sir
he
came
riding
up
what
kind
of
a
man
was
it
no
he
was
cirgameski
oh
you
saw
him
with
your
own
eyes
eh
the
steward
bowed
and
his
loose
white
mantle
fell
forward
exactly
sir
no
helmet
no
he
wore
a
short
singhalût
vest
and
pantaloons
and
a
yellow
hadrasi
hat
no
more
and
the
horse
ah
the
horse
there
a
different
matter
different
how
i
ca
describe
the
horse
i
was
intent
on
the
man
did
you
recognize
him
by
the
brow
of
lord
allah
it
well
not
to
look
too
closely
when
such
matters
occur
then
you
recognize
him
i
must
be
at
my
task
sir
murphy
frowned
in
vexation
at
the
steward
retreating
back
then
bent
over
his
camera
to
check
the
if
anything
appeared
now
and
his
eyes
could
see
it
the
million
audience
of
your
universe
could
see
it
with
him
when
he
looked
up
murphy
made
a
frantic
grab
for
the
stanchion
then
relaxed
cirgamesç
had
taken
the
great
twitch
it
was
an
illusion
a
psychological
quirk
one
instant
the
planet
lay
ahead
then
a
man
winked
or
turned
away
and
when
he
looked
back
ahead
had
become
below
the
planet
had
swung
an
astonishing
ninety
degrees
across
the
sky
and
they
were
murphy
leaned
against
the
stanchion
great
twitch
he
muttered
to
himself
i
like
to
get
on
two
hundred
million
screens
several
hours
passed
cirgamesç
grew
the
sampan
range
rose
up
like
a
dark
scab
the
valley
sultanates
of
singhalût
hadra
new
batavia
and
showed
like
glistening
the
great
rift
colony
of
sundaman
stretched
down
through
the
foothills
like
the
trail
of
a
slug
a
loudspeaker
voice
rattled
the
ship
attention
passengers
for
singhalût
and
other
points
on
cirgamesç
kindly
prepare
your
luggage
for
disembarkation
customs
at
singhalût
are
extremely
thorough
passengers
are
warned
to
take
no
weapons
drugs
or
explosives
ashore
this
is
important
the
warning
turned
out
to
be
an
understatement
murphy
was
plied
with
questions
he
suffered
search
of
an
intimate
nature
he
was
with
a
range
of
frequencies
calculated
to
excite
fluorescence
in
whatever
object
he
might
have
secreted
in
his
stomach
in
a
hollow
bone
or
under
a
layer
of
flesh
his
luggage
was
explored
with
similar
minute
attention
and
murphy
rescued
his
cameras
with
difficulty
what
you
so
damn
anxious
about
i
do
have
drugs
i
do
have
contraband
it
guns
your
excellency
guns
weapons
explosives
i
do
have
any
guns
but
these
objects
here
they
cameras
they
record
pictures
and
sounds
and
smells
the
inspector
seized
the
cases
with
a
glittering
smile
of
triumph
they
resemble
no
cameras
of
my
experience
i
fear
i
shall
have
to
impound
a
young
man
in
loose
white
pantaloons
a
pink
vest
pale
green
cravat
and
a
complex
black
turban
strolled
up
the
inspector
made
a
swift
obeisance
with
arms
spread
wide
excellency
the
young
man
raised
two
fingers
you
may
find
it
possible
to
spare
murphy
any
unnecessary
formality
as
your
excellency
recommends
the
inspector
nimbly
repacked
murphy
belongings
while
the
young
man
looked
on
benignly
murphy
covertly
inspected
his
face
the
skin
was
smooth
the
color
of
the
rising
moon
the
eyes
were
narrow
dark
superficially
placid
the
effect
was
of
silken
punctilio
with
hot
ruby
blood
close
beneath
satisfied
with
the
inspector
zeal
he
turned
to
murphy
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
tuan
murphy
i
am
of
the
house
of
singhalût
and
my
father
the
sultan
begs
you
to
accept
our
poor
hospitality
why
thank
you
said
murphy
this
is
a
very
pleasant
surprise
if
you
will
allow
me
to
conduct
you
he
turned
to
the
inspector
murphy
luggage
to
the
palace
murphy
accompanied
into
the
outside
light
fitting
his
own
quick
step
to
the
prince
feline
saunter
this
is
coming
it
pretty
soft
he
said
to
himself
i
have
a
magnificent
suite
with
bowls
of
fruit
and
gin
pahits
not
to
mention
two
or
three
silken
girls
with
skin
like
rich
cream
bringing
me
towels
in
the
shower
well
well
well
it
not
so
bad
working
for
your
universe
after
all
i
suppose
i
ought
to
unlimber
my
camera
prince
watched
him
with
interest
and
what
is
the
audience
of
your
universe
we
call
expressive
and
how
many
participants
do
you
serve
oh
the
bowdler
index
rises
and
falls
we
got
about
two
hundred
million
screens
with
five
hundred
million
participants
fascinating
and
tell
me
how
do
you
record
smells
murphy
displayed
the
odor
recorder
on
the
side
of
the
camera
with
its
gelatinous
track
which
fixed
the
molecular
design
and
the
odors
recreated
they
are
like
the
originals
pretty
close
never
exact
but
none
of
the
participants
knows
the
difference
sometimes
the
synthetic
odor
is
an
improvement
astounding
murmured
the
prince
and
sometimes
well
carson
tenlake
went
out
to
get
the
on
venus
it
was
a
hot
day
as
days
usually
are
on
venus
and
a
long
climb
when
the
show
was
run
off
there
was
more
smell
of
carson
than
of
flowers
prince
laughed
politely
we
turn
through
here
they
came
out
into
a
compound
paved
with
red
green
and
white
tiles
beneath
the
valley
roof
was
a
sinuous
trough
full
of
haze
and
warmth
and
golden
light
as
far
in
either
direction
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
hillsides
were
terraced
barred
in
various
shades
of
green
spattering
the
valley
floor
were
tall
canvas
pavilions
tents
booths
shelters
naturally
said
prince
we
hope
that
you
and
your
participants
will
enjoy
singhalût
it
is
a
truism
that
in
order
to
import
we
must
export
we
wish
to
encourage
a
pleasurable
response
to
the
in
singhalût
tag
on
our
carvings
lacquers
they
rolled
quietly
across
the
square
in
a
displaying
the
house
emblem
murphy
rested
against
deep
cool
cushions
your
inspectors
are
pretty
careful
about
weapons
smiled
complacently
our
existence
is
ordered
and
peaceful
you
may
be
familiar
with
the
concept
of
i
do
think
so
a
word
an
idea
from
old
earth
every
living
act
is
ordered
by
ritual
but
our
heritage
is
passionate
and
when
unyielding
stands
in
the
way
of
an
irresistible
emotion
there
is
turbulence
sometimes
even
killing
an
exactly
it
is
as
well
that
the
has
no
weapons
other
than
his
knife
otherwise
he
would
kill
twenty
where
now
he
kills
one
the
car
rolled
along
a
narrow
avenue
scattering
pedestrians
to
either
side
like
the
bow
of
a
boat
spreading
foam
the
men
wore
loose
white
pantaloons
and
a
short
open
vest
the
women
wore
only
the
pantaloons
handsome
set
of
people
remarked
murphy
again
smiled
complacently
i
sure
singhalût
will
present
an
inspiring
and
beautiful
spectacle
for
your
program
murphy
remembered
the
keynote
to
howard
frayberg
instructions
sex
mystery
frayberg
cared
little
for
inspiration
or
beauty
i
imagine
he
said
casually
that
you
celebrate
a
number
of
interesting
festivals
colorful
dancing
unique
customs
shook
his
head
to
the
contrary
we
left
our
superstitions
and
back
on
earth
we
are
quiet
mohammedans
and
indulge
in
very
little
festivity
perhaps
here
is
the
reason
for
and
sjambaks
sjambaks
we
are
not
proud
of
them
you
will
hear
sly
rumor
and
it
is
better
that
i
arm
you
beforehand
with
truth
what
is
a
sjambak
they
are
bandits
flouters
of
authority
i
will
show
you
one
presently
i
heard
said
murphy
of
a
man
riding
a
horse
up
to
meet
the
what
would
account
for
a
story
like
that
it
can
have
no
possible
basis
said
prince
we
have
no
horses
on
cirgamesç
none
whatever
but
the
veriest
idle
talk
such
nonsense
will
have
no
interest
for
your
intelligent
participants
the
car
rolled
into
a
square
a
hundred
yards
on
a
side
lined
with
luxuriant
banana
palms
opposite
was
an
enormous
pavilion
of
gold
and
violet
silk
with
a
dozen
peaked
gables
casting
various
changing
sheens
in
the
center
of
the
square
a
pole
supported
a
cage
about
two
feet
wide
three
feet
long
and
four
feet
high
inside
this
cage
crouched
a
naked
man
the
car
rolled
past
prince
waved
an
idle
hand
the
caged
man
glared
down
from
bloodshot
eyes
that
said
is
a
sjambak
as
you
see
a
faint
note
of
apology
entered
his
voice
we
attempt
to
discourage
them
what
that
metal
object
on
his
chest
the
mark
of
his
trade
by
that
you
may
know
all
sjambak
in
these
unsettled
times
only
we
of
the
house
may
cover
our
chests
all
others
must
show
themselves
and
declare
themselves
true
singhalûsi
murphy
said
tentatively
i
must
come
back
here
and
photograph
that
cage
smilingly
shook
his
head
i
will
show
you
our
farms
our
vines
and
orchards
your
participants
will
enjoy
these
they
have
no
interest
in
the
dolor
of
an
ignoble
sjambak
well
said
murphy
our
aim
is
a
production
we
want
to
show
the
farmers
at
work
the
members
of
the
great
house
at
their
responsibilities
as
well
as
the
deserved
fate
of
wrongdoers
exactly
for
every
sjambak
there
are
ten
thousand
industrious
singhalûsi
it
follows
then
that
only
one
part
of
your
film
should
be
devoted
to
this
infamous
minority
about
of
a
second
eh
no
more
than
they
deserve
you
do
know
my
production
director
his
name
is
howard
frayberg
and
howard
frayberg
was
deep
in
conference
with
sam
catlin
under
the
influence
of
what
catlin
called
his
philosophic
kick
it
was
the
phase
which
catlin
feared
most
sam
said
frayberg
do
you
know
the
danger
of
this
business
ulcers
catlin
replied
promptly
frayberg
shook
his
head
we
got
an
occupational
disease
to
fight
progressive
mental
myopia
speak
for
yourself
said
catlin
consider
we
sit
in
this
office
we
think
we
know
what
kind
of
show
we
want
we
send
out
our
staff
to
get
it
we
signing
the
checks
so
back
it
comes
the
way
we
asked
for
it
we
look
at
it
hear
it
smell
it
and
pretty
soon
we
believe
it
our
version
of
the
universe
from
our
brains
like
minerva
stepping
out
of
zeus
you
see
what
i
mean
i
understand
the
words
we
got
our
own
picture
of
what
going
on
we
ask
for
it
we
get
it
it
builds
up
and
up
and
finally
we
like
mice
in
a
trap
built
of
our
own
ideas
we
cannibalize
our
own
brains
nobody
ever
accuse
you
of
being
stingy
with
a
metaphor
sam
let
have
the
truth
how
many
times
have
you
been
off
earth
i
went
to
mars
once
and
i
spent
a
couple
of
weeks
at
aristillus
resort
on
the
moon
frayberg
leaned
back
in
his
chair
as
if
shocked
and
we
supposed
to
be
a
couple
of
learned
planetologists
catlin
made
grumbling
noise
in
his
throat
i
have
been
around
the
zodiac
so
what
you
sneezed
a
few
minutes
ago
and
i
said
but
i
do
have
any
doctor
degree
there
comes
a
time
in
a
man
life
said
frayberg
when
he
wants
to
take
stock
get
a
new
perspective
relax
howard
relax
in
our
case
it
means
taking
out
our
preconceived
ideas
looking
at
them
checking
our
illusions
against
reality
are
you
serious
about
this
another
thing
said
frayberg
i
want
to
check
up
a
little
shifkin
says
the
expense
accounts
are
frightful
but
he
ca
fight
it
when
keeler
says
he
paid
ten
munits
for
a
loaf
of
bread
on
nekkar
iv
gon
na
call
him
on
it
hell
let
him
eat
bread
that
cheaper
than
making
a
safari
around
the
cluster
the
frayberg
paid
no
heed
he
touched
a
button
a
sphere
full
of
glistening
motes
appeared
earth
was
at
the
center
with
thin
red
lines
the
scheduled
routes
radiating
out
in
all
directions
let
see
what
kind
of
circle
we
can
make
said
frayberg
here
at
canopus
keeler
over
here
at
blue
moon
wilbur
murphy
at
sirgamesk
do
forget
muttered
catlin
we
got
a
show
to
put
on
we
got
material
for
a
year
scoffed
frayberg
get
hold
of
we
start
with
sirgamesk
and
see
what
wilbur
murphy
up
to
wilbur
murphy
was
being
presented
to
the
sultan
of
singhalût
by
the
prince
the
sultan
a
small
mild
man
of
seventy
sat
crosslegged
on
an
enormous
pink
and
green
be
at
your
ease
murphy
we
dispense
with
as
much
protocol
here
as
practicable
the
sultan
had
a
dry
clipped
voice
and
the
air
of
a
rather
harassed
corporation
executive
i
understand
you
represent
home
screen
network
i
a
staff
photographer
for
the
your
universe
show
we
export
a
great
deal
to
earth
mused
the
sultan
but
not
as
much
as
we
like
we
very
pleased
with
your
interest
in
us
and
naturally
we
want
to
help
you
in
every
way
possible
tomorrow
the
keeper
of
the
archives
will
present
a
series
of
charts
analyzing
our
economy
shall
personally
conduct
you
through
the
we
want
you
to
know
we
doing
a
great
job
out
here
on
singhalût
i
sure
you
are
said
murphy
uncomfortably
however
that
quite
the
stuff
i
want
no
just
where
do
your
desires
lie
said
delicately
murphy
took
a
rather
profound
interest
in
the
sjambak
displayed
in
the
square
oh
and
you
explained
that
these
renegades
could
hold
no
interest
for
serious
students
of
our
planet
murphy
started
to
explain
that
clustered
around
two
hundred
million
screens
tuned
to
your
universe
were
four
or
five
hundred
million
participants
the
greater
part
of
them
neither
serious
nor
students
the
sultan
cut
in
decisively
i
will
now
impart
something
truly
interesting
we
singhalûsi
are
making
preparations
to
reclaim
four
more
valleys
with
an
added
area
of
six
hundred
thousand
acres
i
shall
put
my
physiographic
models
at
your
disposal
you
may
use
them
to
the
fullest
extent
i
be
pleased
for
the
opportunity
declared
murphy
but
tomorrow
i
like
to
prowl
around
the
valley
meet
your
people
observe
their
customs
religious
rites
courtships
funerals
the
sultan
pulled
a
sour
face
we
are
dull
festivals
are
celebrated
quietly
in
the
home
there
is
small
religious
fervor
courtships
are
consummated
by
family
contract
i
fear
you
will
find
little
sensational
material
here
in
singhalût
you
have
no
temple
dances
asked
murphy
no
voodoo
the
sultan
smiled
patronizingly
we
came
out
here
to
cirgamesç
to
escape
the
ancient
superstitions
our
lives
are
calm
orderly
even
the
have
practically
disappeared
but
the
sjambaks
negligible
well
said
murphy
i
like
to
visit
some
of
these
ancient
cities
i
advise
against
it
declared
the
sultan
they
are
shards
weathered
stone
there
are
no
inscriptions
no
art
there
is
no
stimulation
in
dead
stone
now
tomorrow
i
will
hear
a
report
on
hybrid
soybean
plantings
in
the
upper
kam
district
you
will
want
to
be
present
murphy
suite
matched
or
even
excelled
his
expectation
he
had
four
rooms
and
a
private
garden
enclosed
by
a
thicket
of
bamboo
his
bathroom
walls
were
slabs
of
glossy
actinolite
inlaid
with
cinnabar
jade
galena
pyrite
and
blue
malachite
in
representations
of
fantastic
birds
his
bedroom
was
a
tent
thirty
feet
high
two
walls
were
dark
green
fabric
a
third
was
golden
rust
the
fourth
opened
upon
the
private
garden
murphy
bed
was
a
pink
and
yellow
creation
ten
feet
square
soft
as
cobweb
smelling
of
rose
sandalwood
carved
black
lacquer
tubs
held
fruit
two
dozen
wines
liquors
syrups
essences
flowed
at
a
touch
from
as
many
ebony
spigots
the
garden
centered
on
a
pool
of
cool
water
very
pleasant
in
the
hothouse
climate
of
singhalût
the
only
shortcoming
was
the
lack
of
the
lovely
young
servitors
murphy
had
envisioned
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
repair
this
lack
and
in
a
shady
behind
the
palace
called
the
barangipan
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
named
soek
panjoebang
he
found
her
enticing
tones
of
quavering
sweetness
from
the
an
instrument
in
old
bali
soek
panjoebang
had
the
delicate
features
and
transparent
skin
of
sumatra
the
supple
long
limbs
of
arabia
and
in
a
pair
of
wide
and
golden
eyes
a
heritage
from
somewhere
in
celtic
europe
murphy
bought
her
a
goblet
of
frozen
shavings
each
a
different
perfume
while
he
himself
drank
white
soek
panjoebang
displayed
an
intense
interest
in
the
ways
of
earth
and
murphy
found
it
hard
to
guide
the
conversation
weelbrrr
she
said
such
a
funny
name
weelbrrr
do
you
think
i
could
play
the
in
the
great
cities
the
great
palaces
of
earth
sure
there
no
law
against
you
talk
so
funny
weelbrrr
i
like
to
hear
you
talk
i
suppose
you
get
kinda
bored
here
in
singhalût
she
shrugged
life
is
pleasant
but
it
concerns
with
little
things
we
have
no
great
adventures
we
grow
flowers
we
play
the
she
eyed
him
archly
sidelong
we
love
we
sleep
murphy
grinned
you
run
no
no
no
that
is
no
more
not
since
the
sjambaks
eh
the
sjambaks
are
bad
but
better
than
when
a
man
feels
the
knot
forming
around
his
chest
he
no
longer
takes
his
kris
and
runs
down
the
street
he
becomes
sjambak
this
was
getting
interesting
where
does
he
go
what
does
he
do
he
robs
who
does
he
rob
what
does
he
do
with
his
loot
she
leaned
toward
him
it
is
not
well
to
talk
of
them
why
not
the
sultan
does
not
wish
it
everywhere
are
listeners
when
one
talks
sjambak
the
sultan
ears
rise
like
the
points
on
a
cat
suppose
they
do
what
the
difference
i
got
a
legitimate
interest
i
saw
one
of
them
in
that
cage
out
there
that
torture
i
want
to
know
about
it
he
is
very
bad
he
opened
the
monorail
car
and
the
air
rushed
out
singhalûsi
and
hadrasi
bloated
and
blew
up
and
what
happened
to
the
sjambak
he
took
all
the
gold
and
money
and
jewels
and
ran
away
ran
where
out
across
great
pharasang
plain
but
he
was
a
fool
he
came
back
to
singhalût
for
his
wife
he
was
caught
and
set
up
for
all
people
to
look
at
so
they
might
tell
each
other
it
is
for
sjambaks
where
do
the
sjambaks
hide
out
oh
she
looked
vaguely
around
the
room
out
on
the
plains
in
the
mountains
they
must
have
some
shelter
an
no
the
sultan
would
send
out
his
and
destroy
them
they
roam
quietly
they
hide
among
the
rocks
and
tend
their
oxygen
stills
sometimes
they
visit
the
old
cities
i
wonder
said
murphy
staring
into
his
beer
could
it
be
sjambaks
who
ride
horses
up
to
meet
the
soek
panjoebang
knit
her
black
eyebrows
as
if
preoccupied
that
what
brought
me
out
here
murphy
went
on
this
story
of
a
man
riding
a
horse
out
in
space
ridiculous
we
have
no
horses
in
cirgamesç
all
right
the
steward
wo
swear
to
the
horse
suppose
the
man
was
up
there
on
foot
or
riding
a
bicycle
but
the
steward
recognized
the
man
who
was
this
man
pray
the
steward
clammed
up
the
name
would
have
been
just
noise
to
me
anyway
might
recognize
the
name
ask
him
yourself
the
ship
still
out
at
the
field
she
shook
her
head
slowly
holding
her
golden
eyes
on
his
face
i
do
not
care
to
attract
the
attention
of
either
steward
sjambak
or
sultan
murphy
said
impatiently
in
any
event
it
not
who
but
how
does
the
man
breathe
vacuum
sucks
a
man
lungs
up
out
of
his
mouth
bursts
his
stomach
his
ears
we
have
excellent
doctors
said
soek
panjoebang
shuddering
but
alas
i
am
not
one
of
them
murphy
looked
at
her
sharply
her
voice
held
the
plangent
sweetness
of
her
instrument
with
additional
overtones
of
mockery
there
must
be
some
kind
of
invisible
dome
around
him
holding
in
air
said
murphy
and
what
if
there
is
it
something
new
and
if
it
is
i
want
to
find
out
about
it
soek
smiled
languidly
you
are
so
typical
an
worried
frowning
dynamic
you
should
relax
cultivate
enjoy
life
as
we
do
here
in
singhalût
what
it
our
philosophy
where
we
find
meaning
and
life
and
beauty
in
every
aspect
of
the
world
that
sjambak
in
the
cage
could
do
with
a
little
less
right
now
no
doubt
he
is
unhappy
she
agreed
unhappy
he
being
tortured
he
broke
the
sultan
law
his
life
is
no
longer
his
own
it
belongs
to
singhalût
if
the
sultan
wishes
to
use
it
to
warn
other
wrongdoers
the
fact
that
the
man
suffers
is
of
small
interest
if
they
all
wear
that
metal
ornament
how
can
they
hope
to
hide
out
he
glanced
at
her
own
bare
bosom
they
appear
by
night
slip
through
the
streets
like
ghosts
she
looked
in
turn
at
murphy
loose
shirt
you
will
notice
persons
brushing
up
against
you
feeling
you
she
laid
her
hand
along
his
breast
and
when
this
happens
you
will
know
they
are
agents
of
the
sultan
because
only
strangers
and
the
house
may
wear
shirts
but
now
let
me
sing
to
you
a
song
from
the
old
land
old
java
you
will
not
understand
the
tongue
but
no
other
words
so
join
the
voice
of
the
this
is
the
said
murphy
instead
of
a
garden
suite
with
a
private
pool
i
usually
sleep
in
a
with
nothing
to
eat
but
condensed
food
soek
panjoebang
flung
the
water
out
of
her
sleek
black
hair
perhaps
weelbrrr
you
will
regret
leaving
cirgamesç
well
he
looked
up
to
the
transparent
roof
barely
visible
where
the
sunlight
collected
and
refracted
i
do
particularly
like
being
shut
up
like
a
bird
in
an
aviary
mildly
claustrophobic
i
guess
after
breakfast
drinking
thick
coffee
from
tiny
silver
cups
murphy
looked
long
and
reflectively
at
soek
panjoebang
what
are
you
thinking
weelbrrr
murphy
drained
his
coffee
i
thinking
that
i
better
be
getting
to
work
and
what
do
you
do
first
i
going
to
shoot
the
palace
and
you
sitting
here
in
the
garden
playing
your
but
weelbrrr
not
you
a
part
of
the
universe
rather
an
interesting
part
then
take
the
square
and
the
sjambak
a
quiet
voice
spoke
from
behind
a
visitor
tuan
murphy
murphy
turned
his
head
bring
him
in
he
looked
back
to
soek
panjoebang
she
was
on
her
feet
it
is
necessary
that
i
go
when
will
i
see
you
tonight
at
the
barangipan
the
quiet
voice
said
rube
trimmer
tuan
trimmer
was
small
and
with
thin
shoulders
and
a
paunch
he
carried
himself
with
a
swagger
left
over
from
a
time
twenty
years
gone
his
skin
had
the
waxy
look
of
lost
floridity
his
tuft
of
white
hair
was
coarse
and
thin
his
eyelids
hung
in
the
droop
that
amateur
physiognomists
like
to
associate
with
guile
i
resident
director
of
the
bank
said
trimmer
heard
you
were
here
and
thought
i
pay
my
respects
i
suppose
you
do
see
many
strangers
not
too
many
there
nothing
much
to
bring
cirgamesç
is
a
comfortable
tourist
planet
too
confined
shut
in
a
man
with
a
sensitive
psyche
goes
nuts
pretty
easy
here
yeah
said
murphy
i
was
thinking
the
same
thing
this
morning
that
dome
begins
to
give
a
man
the
willies
how
do
the
natives
stand
it
or
do
they
trimmer
pulled
out
a
cigar
case
murphy
refused
the
offer
local
tobacco
said
trimmer
very
good
he
lit
up
thoughtfully
well
you
might
say
that
the
cirgameski
are
schizophrenic
they
got
the
docile
javanese
blood
plus
the
arabian
élan
the
javanese
part
is
on
top
but
every
once
in
a
while
you
see
a
flash
of
arrogance
you
never
know
i
been
out
here
nine
years
and
i
still
a
stranger
he
puffed
on
his
cigar
studied
murphy
with
his
careful
eyes
you
work
for
your
universe
i
hear
yeah
i
one
of
the
leg
men
must
be
a
great
job
a
man
sees
a
lot
of
the
galaxy
and
he
runs
into
queer
tales
like
this
sjambak
stuff
trimmer
nodded
without
surprise
my
advice
to
you
murphy
is
lay
off
the
sjambaks
they
not
healthy
around
here
murphy
was
startled
by
the
bluntness
what
the
big
mystery
about
these
sjambaks
trimmer
looked
around
the
room
this
place
is
bugged
i
found
two
and
plugged
said
murphy
trimmer
laughed
those
were
just
plants
they
hide
where
a
man
might
just
barely
spot
you
ca
catch
the
real
ones
they
woven
into
the
cloth
wires
murphy
looked
critically
at
the
cloth
walls
do
let
it
worry
you
said
trimmer
they
listen
more
out
of
habit
than
anything
else
if
you
fussy
we
go
for
a
walk
the
road
led
past
the
palace
into
the
country
murphy
and
trimmer
sauntered
along
a
placid
river
overgrown
with
lily
pads
swarming
with
large
white
ducks
this
sjambak
business
said
murphy
everybody
talks
around
it
you
ca
pin
anybody
down
including
me
said
trimmer
i
more
or
less
privileged
around
here
the
sultan
finances
his
reclamation
through
the
bank
on
the
basis
of
my
reports
but
there
more
to
singhalût
than
the
sultan
namely
trimmer
waved
his
cigar
waggishly
now
we
getting
in
where
i
like
to
talk
i
give
you
a
hint
prince
ali
thinks
more
valleys
is
a
waste
of
money
when
there
hadra
and
new
batavia
and
sundaman
so
close
you
mean
armed
conquest
trimmer
laughed
you
said
it
not
me
they
ca
carry
on
much
of
a
war
unless
the
soldiers
commute
by
monorail
maybe
prince
ali
thinks
he
got
the
answer
sjambaks
i
did
say
it
said
trimmer
blandly
murphy
grinned
after
a
moment
he
said
i
picked
up
with
a
girl
named
soek
panjoebang
who
plays
the
i
suppose
she
working
for
either
the
sultan
or
prince
ali
do
you
know
which
trimmer
eyes
sparkled
he
shook
his
head
might
be
either
one
there
a
way
to
find
out
yeah
get
her
off
where
you
sure
there
no
tell
her
two
things
one
for
ali
the
other
for
the
sultan
whichever
one
reacts
you
know
you
got
her
tagged
for
instance
well
for
instance
she
learns
that
you
can
rig
up
a
hypnotic
ray
from
a
flashlight
battery
a
piece
of
bamboo
and
a
few
lengths
of
wire
that
get
ali
in
an
awful
sweat
he
ca
get
weapons
none
at
all
and
for
the
sultan
trimmer
was
warming
up
to
his
intrigue
chewing
on
his
cigar
with
gusto
tell
her
you
on
to
a
catalyst
that
turns
clay
into
aluminum
and
oxygen
in
the
presence
of
sunlight
the
sultan
would
sell
his
right
leg
for
something
like
that
he
tries
hard
for
singhalût
and
cirgamesç
and
ali
trimmer
hesitated
i
never
said
what
i
gon
na
say
do
forget
i
never
said
it
okay
you
never
said
it
ever
hear
of
a
mohammedan
holy
wars
believe
it
or
not
ali
wants
a
sounds
kinda
fantastic
sure
it
fantastic
do
forget
i
never
said
anything
about
it
but
suppose
someone
strictly
unofficial
of
course
let
the
idea
percolate
around
the
peace
office
back
home
ah
said
murphy
that
why
you
came
to
see
me
trimmer
turned
a
look
of
injured
innocence
now
murphy
you
a
little
unfair
i
a
friendly
guy
of
course
i
do
like
to
see
the
bank
lose
what
we
got
tied
up
in
the
sultan
why
do
you
send
in
a
report
yourself
i
have
but
when
they
hear
the
same
thing
from
you
a
your
universe
man
they
might
make
a
move
murphy
nodded
well
we
understand
each
other
said
trimmer
heartily
and
everything
clear
not
entirely
how
ali
going
to
launch
a
when
he
does
have
any
weapons
no
warships
no
supplies
now
said
trimmer
we
getting
into
the
realm
of
supposition
he
paused
looked
behind
him
a
farmer
pushing
a
rotary
tiller
bowed
politely
trundled
ahead
behind
was
a
young
man
in
a
black
turban
gold
earrings
a
black
and
red
vest
white
pantaloons
black
slippers
he
bowed
started
past
trimmer
held
up
his
hand
do
waste
your
time
up
there
we
going
back
in
a
few
minutes
thank
you
tuan
who
are
you
reporting
to
the
sultan
or
prince
ali
the
tuan
is
sure
to
pierce
the
veil
of
my
evasions
i
shall
not
dissemble
i
am
the
sultan
man
trimmer
nodded
now
if
you
kindly
remove
to
about
a
hundred
yards
where
your
whisper
wo
work
by
your
leave
i
go
he
retreated
without
haste
he
almost
certainly
working
for
ali
said
trimmer
not
a
very
subtle
lie
oh
yes
third
level
he
figured
i
take
it
second
level
how
that
again
naturally
i
would
believe
him
he
knew
i
knew
that
he
knew
it
so
when
he
said
i
think
he
would
lie
simply
but
that
lie
double
that
he
actually
was
working
for
the
sultan
murphy
laughed
suppose
he
told
you
a
lie
it
starts
to
be
a
pretty
soon
trimmer
admitted
i
think
he
gives
me
credit
for
that
much
subtlety
what
are
you
doing
the
rest
of
the
day
taking
footage
do
you
know
where
i
can
find
some
picturesque
rites
mystical
dances
human
sacrifice
i
got
to
work
up
some
glamor
and
exotic
lore
there
this
sjambak
in
the
cage
that
about
as
close
to
the
medieval
as
you
find
anywhere
in
earth
commonwealth
speaking
of
sjambaks
no
time
said
trimmer
got
to
get
back
drop
in
at
my
office
right
down
the
square
from
the
palace
murphy
returned
to
his
suite
the
shadowy
figure
of
his
room
servant
said
his
highness
the
sultan
desires
the
tuan
attendance
in
the
cascade
garden
thank
you
said
murphy
as
soon
as
i
load
my
camera
the
cascade
room
was
an
open
patio
in
front
of
an
artificial
waterfall
the
sultan
was
pacing
back
and
forth
wearing
dusty
khaki
puttees
brown
plastic
boots
a
yellow
polo
shirt
he
carried
a
twig
which
he
used
as
a
riding
crop
slapping
his
boots
as
he
walked
he
turned
his
head
as
murphy
appeared
pointed
his
twig
at
a
wicker
bench
i
pray
you
sit
down
mr
murphy
he
paced
once
up
and
back
how
is
your
suite
you
find
it
to
your
liking
very
much
so
excellent
said
the
sultan
you
do
me
honor
with
your
presence
murphy
waited
patiently
i
understand
that
you
had
a
visitor
this
morning
said
the
sultan
yes
mr
trimmer
may
i
inquire
the
nature
of
the
conversation
it
was
of
a
personal
nature
said
murphy
rather
more
shortly
than
he
meant
the
sultan
nodded
wistfully
a
singhalûsi
would
have
wasted
an
hour
telling
me
distorted
enough
to
confuse
but
not
sufficiently
inaccurate
to
anger
me
if
i
had
a
on
him
all
the
time
murphy
grinned
a
singhalûsi
has
to
live
here
the
rest
of
his
life
a
servant
wheeled
a
frosted
cabinet
before
them
placed
goblets
under
two
spigots
withdrew
the
sultan
cleared
his
throat
trimmer
is
an
excellent
fellow
but
unbelievably
loquacious
murphy
drew
himself
two
inches
of
chilled
liquor
the
sultan
slapped
his
boots
with
the
twig
undoubtedly
he
confided
all
my
private
business
to
you
or
at
least
as
much
as
i
have
allowed
him
to
learn
well
he
spoke
of
your
hope
to
increase
the
compass
of
singhalût
that
my
friend
is
no
hope
it
absolute
necessity
our
population
density
is
fifteen
hundred
to
the
square
mile
we
must
expand
or
smother
there
be
too
little
food
to
eat
too
little
oxygen
to
breathe
murphy
suddenly
came
to
life
i
could
make
that
idea
the
theme
of
my
feature
singhalût
dilemma
expand
or
perish
no
that
would
be
inadvisable
inapplicable
murphy
was
not
convinced
it
sounds
like
a
natural
the
sultan
smiled
i
impart
an
item
of
confidential
information
although
trimmer
no
doubt
has
preceded
me
with
it
he
gave
his
boots
an
irritated
whack
to
expand
i
need
funds
funds
are
best
secured
in
an
atmosphere
of
calm
and
confidence
the
implication
of
emergency
would
be
disastrous
to
my
aims
well
said
murphy
i
see
your
position
the
sultan
glanced
at
murphy
sidelong
anticipating
your
cooperation
my
minister
of
propaganda
has
arranged
an
hour
program
stressing
our
progressive
social
attitude
our
prosperity
and
financial
prospects
but
sultan
well
i
ca
allow
your
minister
of
propaganda
to
use
me
and
your
universe
as
a
kind
of
investment
brochure
the
sultan
nodded
wearily
i
expected
you
to
take
that
attitude
well
what
do
you
yourself
have
in
mind
i
been
looking
for
something
to
tie
to
said
murphy
i
think
going
to
be
the
dramatic
contrast
between
the
ruined
cities
and
the
new
domed
valleys
how
the
earth
settlers
succeeded
where
the
ancient
people
failed
to
meet
the
challenge
of
the
dissipating
atmosphere
well
the
sultan
said
grudgingly
that
not
too
bad
today
i
want
to
take
some
shots
of
the
palace
the
dome
the
city
the
paddies
groves
orchards
farms
tomorrow
i
taking
a
trip
out
to
one
of
the
ruins
i
see
said
the
sultan
then
you
wo
need
my
charts
and
statistics
well
sultan
i
could
film
the
stuff
your
propaganda
minister
cooked
up
and
i
could
take
it
back
to
earth
howard
frayberg
or
sam
catlin
would
tear
into
it
rip
it
apart
lard
in
some
a
little
cannibalism
and
temple
prostitution
and
you
never
know
you
were
watching
singhalût
you
scream
with
horror
and
i
be
fired
in
that
case
said
the
sultan
i
will
leave
you
to
the
dictates
of
your
conscience
howard
frayberg
looked
around
the
gray
landscape
of
riker
planet
gazed
out
over
the
roaring
black
mogador
ocean
sam
i
think
there
a
story
out
there
sam
catlin
shivered
inside
his
electrically
heated
glass
overcoat
out
on
that
ocean
it
full
of
plesiosaurs
horrible
things
forty
feet
long
suppose
we
worked
something
out
on
the
line
of
moby
dick
white
monster
of
the
mogador
we
set
sail
in
a
catamaran
us
no
said
frayberg
impatiently
of
course
not
us
two
or
three
of
the
staff
they
sail
out
there
look
over
these
gray
and
red
monsters
maybe
fake
a
fight
or
two
but
all
the
time
they
after
the
legendary
white
one
how
it
sound
i
do
think
we
pay
our
men
enough
money
wilbur
murphy
might
do
it
he
willing
to
look
for
a
man
riding
a
horse
up
to
meet
his
he
might
draw
the
line
at
a
white
plesiosaur
riding
up
to
meet
his
catamaran
frayberg
turned
away
somebody
got
to
have
ideas
around
here
we
better
head
back
to
the
said
catlin
we
got
two
hours
to
make
the
sirgamesk
shuttle
wilbur
murphy
sat
in
the
barangipan
watching
marionettes
performing
to
xylophone
castanet
gong
and
the
drama
had
its
roots
in
it
had
filtered
down
through
ancient
india
medieval
burma
malaya
across
the
straits
of
malacca
to
sumatra
and
java
from
modern
java
across
space
to
cirgamesç
five
thousand
years
of
time
two
hundred
of
space
somewhere
along
the
route
it
had
met
and
assimilated
modern
technology
magnetic
beams
controlled
arms
legs
and
bodies
guided
the
poses
and
posturings
the
face
by
agency
of
clip
wire
radio
control
and
minuscule
selsyn
projected
his
scowl
smile
sneer
or
grimace
to
the
peaked
little
face
he
controlled
the
language
was
that
of
old
java
which
perhaps
a
third
of
the
spectators
understood
this
portion
did
not
include
murphy
and
when
the
performance
ended
he
was
no
wiser
than
at
the
start
soek
panjoebang
slipped
into
the
seat
beside
murphy
she
wore
garb
a
sarong
of
brown
blue
and
black
and
a
fantastic
headdress
of
tiny
silver
bells
she
greeted
him
with
enthusiasm
weelbrrr
i
saw
you
watching
it
was
very
interesting
ah
yes
she
sighed
weelbrrr
you
take
me
with
you
back
to
earth
you
make
me
a
great
picturama
star
please
weelbrrr
well
i
do
know
about
that
i
behave
very
well
weelbrrr
she
nuzzled
his
shoulder
looked
soulfully
up
with
her
shiny
eyes
murphy
nearly
forgot
the
experiment
he
intended
to
perform
what
did
you
do
today
weelbrrr
you
look
at
all
the
pretty
girls
nope
i
ran
footage
got
the
palace
climbed
the
ridge
up
to
the
condensation
vanes
i
never
knew
there
was
so
much
water
in
the
air
till
i
saw
the
stream
pouring
off
those
vanes
and
we
have
much
sunlight
it
makes
the
rice
grow
the
sultan
ought
to
put
some
of
that
excess
light
to
work
there
a
secret
process
well
i
better
not
say
oh
come
weelbrrr
tell
me
your
secrets
it
not
much
of
a
secret
just
a
catalyst
that
separates
clay
into
aluminum
and
oxygen
when
sunlight
shines
on
it
soek
eyebrows
rose
poised
in
place
like
a
seagull
riding
the
wind
weelbrrr
i
did
not
know
you
for
a
man
of
learning
oh
you
thought
i
was
just
a
bum
eh
good
enough
to
make
picturama
stars
out
of
players
but
no
special
genius
no
no
weelbrrr
i
know
lots
of
tricks
i
can
take
a
flashlight
battery
a
piece
of
copper
foil
a
few
transistors
and
bamboo
tube
and
turn
out
a
paralyzer
gun
that
stop
a
man
cold
in
his
tracks
and
you
know
how
much
it
costs
no
weelbrrr
how
much
ten
cents
it
wears
out
after
two
or
three
months
but
what
the
difference
i
make
as
a
hobby
turn
out
two
or
three
an
hour
weelbrrr
you
a
man
of
marvels
hello
we
will
drink
and
murphy
settled
back
in
the
wicker
chair
sipping
his
rice
beer
today
said
murphy
i
get
into
a
and
ride
out
to
the
ruins
in
the
plain
ghatamipol
i
think
they
called
like
to
come
no
weelbrrr
soek
panjoebang
looked
off
into
the
garden
her
hands
busy
tucking
a
flower
into
her
hair
a
few
minutes
later
she
said
why
must
you
waste
your
time
among
the
rocks
there
are
better
things
to
do
and
see
and
it
might
well
be
dangerous
she
murmured
the
last
word
danger
from
the
sjambaks
yes
perhaps
the
sultan
giving
me
a
guard
twenty
men
with
crossbows
the
sjambaks
carry
shields
why
should
they
risk
their
lives
attacking
me
soek
panjoebang
shrugged
after
a
moment
she
rose
to
her
feet
goodbye
weelbrrr
goodbye
is
this
rather
abrupt
wo
i
see
you
tonight
if
so
be
allah
will
murphy
looked
after
the
lithe
swaying
figure
she
paused
plucked
a
yellow
flower
looked
over
her
shoulder
her
eyes
yellow
as
the
flower
lucent
as
held
his
her
face
was
utterly
expressionless
she
turned
tossed
away
the
flower
with
a
jaunty
gesture
and
continued
her
shoulders
swinging
murphy
breathed
deeply
she
might
have
made
picturama
at
that
one
hour
later
he
met
his
escort
at
the
valley
gate
they
were
dressed
in
for
the
plains
twenty
men
with
sullen
faces
the
trip
to
ghatamipol
clearly
was
not
to
their
liking
murphy
climbed
into
his
own
suit
checked
the
oxygen
pressure
gauge
the
seal
at
his
collar
all
ready
boys
no
one
spoke
the
silence
drew
out
the
gatekeeper
on
hand
to
let
the
party
out
snickered
they
all
ready
tuan
well
said
murphy
let
go
then
outside
the
gate
murphy
made
a
second
check
of
his
equipment
no
leaks
in
his
suit
inside
pressure
outside
pressure
zero
his
twenty
guards
morosely
inspected
their
crossbows
and
slim
swords
the
white
ruins
of
ghatamipol
lay
five
miles
across
pharasang
plain
the
horizon
was
clear
the
sun
was
high
the
sky
was
black
murphy
radio
hummed
someone
said
sharply
look
there
it
goes
he
wheeled
around
his
guards
had
halted
and
were
pointing
he
saw
a
fleet
something
vanishing
into
the
distance
let
go
said
murphy
there
nothing
out
there
sjambak
well
there
only
one
of
them
where
one
walks
others
follow
that
why
the
twenty
of
you
are
here
it
is
madness
challenging
the
sjambaks
what
is
gained
another
argued
i
be
the
judge
of
that
said
murphy
and
set
off
along
the
plain
the
warriors
reluctantly
followed
muttering
to
each
other
over
their
radio
intercoms
the
eroded
city
walls
rose
above
them
occupied
more
and
more
of
the
sky
the
platoon
leader
said
in
an
angry
voice
we
have
gone
far
enough
you
under
my
orders
said
murphy
we
going
through
the
gate
he
punched
the
button
on
his
camera
and
passed
under
the
monstrous
portal
the
city
was
frailer
stuff
than
the
wall
and
had
succumbed
to
the
thin
storms
which
had
raged
a
million
years
after
the
passing
of
life
murphy
marvelled
at
the
scope
of
the
ruins
virgin
archaeological
territory
no
telling
what
a
few
weeks
digging
might
turn
up
murphy
considered
his
expense
account
shifkin
was
the
obstacle
there
be
tremendous
prestige
and
publicity
for
your
universe
if
murphy
uncovered
a
tomb
a
library
works
of
art
the
sultan
would
gladly
provide
diggers
they
were
a
sturdy
enough
people
they
could
make
quite
a
showing
in
a
week
if
they
were
able
to
put
aside
their
superstitions
fears
and
dreads
murphy
sized
one
of
them
up
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
sat
on
a
sunny
slab
of
rock
and
if
he
felt
uneasy
he
concealed
it
quite
successfully
in
fact
thought
murphy
he
appeared
completely
relaxed
maybe
the
problem
of
securing
diggers
was
a
minor
one
after
all
and
here
was
an
odd
sidelight
on
the
singhalûsi
character
once
clear
of
the
valley
the
man
openly
wore
his
shirt
a
fine
loose
garment
of
electric
blue
in
defiance
of
the
sultan
edict
of
course
out
here
he
might
be
cold
murphy
felt
his
own
skin
crawling
how
could
he
be
cold
how
could
he
be
alive
where
was
his
he
lounged
on
the
rock
grinning
sardonically
at
murphy
he
wore
heavy
sandals
a
black
turban
loose
breeches
the
blue
shirt
nothing
more
where
were
the
others
murphy
turned
a
feverish
glance
over
his
shoulder
a
good
three
miles
distant
bounding
and
leaping
toward
singhalût
were
twenty
desperate
figures
they
all
wore
this
man
here
a
sjambak
a
wizard
a
hallucination
the
creature
rose
to
his
feet
strode
springily
toward
murphy
he
carried
a
crossbow
and
a
sword
like
those
of
murphy
guards
but
he
wore
no
could
there
be
breathable
traces
of
an
atmosphere
murphy
glanced
at
his
gauge
outside
pressure
zero
two
other
men
appeared
moving
with
long
elastic
steps
their
eyes
were
bright
their
faces
flushed
they
came
up
to
murphy
took
his
arm
they
were
solid
corporeal
they
had
no
invisible
force
fields
around
their
heads
murphy
jerked
his
arm
free
let
go
of
me
damn
it
but
they
certainly
could
hear
him
through
the
vacuum
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
the
first
man
held
his
naked
blade
a
foot
or
two
behind
murphy
bulging
murphy
made
no
further
resistance
he
punched
the
button
on
his
camera
to
automatic
it
would
now
run
for
several
hours
recording
one
hundred
pictures
per
second
a
thousand
to
the
inch
the
sjambaks
led
murphy
two
hundred
yards
to
a
metal
door
they
opened
it
pushed
murphy
inside
banged
it
shut
murphy
felt
the
vibration
through
his
shoes
heard
a
gradually
waxing
hum
his
gauge
showed
an
outside
pressure
of
an
inner
door
opened
hands
pulled
murphy
in
unclamped
his
dome
just
what
going
on
here
demanded
murphy
angrily
prince
pointed
to
a
table
murphy
saw
a
flashlight
battery
aluminum
foil
wire
a
transistor
kit
metal
tubing
tools
a
few
other
odds
and
ends
there
it
is
said
prince

to
work

see
one
of
these
paralysis
weapons
you
boast
of
just
like
that
eh
just
like
that
what
do
you
want
for
does
it
matter
i
like
to
know
murphy
was
conscious
of
his
camera
recording
sight
sound
odor
i
lead
an
army
said
but
they
march
without
weapons
give
me
weapons
i
will
carry
the
word
to
hadra
to
new
batavia
to
sundaman
to
how
why
it
is
enough
that
i
will
it
again
i
beg
of
you
he
indicated
the
table
murphy
laughed
i
got
myself
in
a
fine
mess
suppose
i
do
make
this
weapon
for
you
you
remain
until
you
do
under
increasingly
difficult
conditions
i
be
here
a
long
time
if
such
is
the
case
said
we
must
make
our
arrangements
for
your
care
on
a
basis
ali
made
a
gesture
hands
seized
murphy
shoulders
a
respirator
was
held
to
his
nostrils
he
thought
of
his
camera
and
he
could
have
laughed
mystery
excitement
thrills
dramatic
sequence
for
your
universe
murdered
by
fanatics
the
crime
recorded
on
his
own
camera
see
the
blood
hear
his
smell
the
poison
the
vapor
choked
him
a
break
what
a
sequence
sirgamesk
said
howard
frayberg
bigger
and
brighter
every
minute
it
must
been
just
about
in
here
said
catlin
that
horseback
rider
appeared
that
right
steward
yes
sir
we
about
twenty
thousand
miles
out
are
we
about
fifteen
thousand
sir
sidereal
cavalry
what
an
idea
i
wonder
how
wilbur
making
out
on
his
superstition
angle
sam
catlin
watching
out
the
window
said
in
a
tight
voice
why
not
ask
him
yourself
eh
ask
him
for
yourself
there
he
is
outside
riding
some
kind
of
critter
it
a
ghost
whispered
frayberg
a
man
without
a
there
no
such
thing
he
sees
us
look
murphy
was
staring
at
them
and
his
surprise
seemed
equal
to
their
own
he
waved
his
hand
catlin
gingerly
waved
back
said
frayberg
that
not
a
horse
he
riding
it
a
combination
and
kiddie
car
with
stirrups
he
coming
aboard
the
ship
said
catlin
that
the
entrance
port
down
there
wilbur
murphy
sat
in
the
captain
stateroom
taking
careful
breaths
of
air
how
are
you
now
asked
frayberg
fine
a
little
sore
in
the
lungs
i
should
wonder
the
ship
doctor
growled
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
how
does
it
feel
out
there
wilbur
catlin
asked
it
feels
awful
lonesome
and
empty
and
the
breath
seeping
up
out
of
your
lungs
never
going
in
that
a
funny
feeling
and
you
miss
the
air
blowing
on
your
skin
i
never
realized
it
before
air
feels
like
like
silk
like
whipped
cream
it
got
texture
but
are
you
cold
space
is
supposed
to
be
absolute
zero
space
is
nothing
it
not
hot
and
it
not
cold
when
you
in
the
sunlight
you
get
warm
it
better
in
the
shade
you
do
lose
any
heat
by
air
convection
but
radiation
and
sweat
evaporation
keep
you
comfortably
cool
i
still
ca
understand
it
said
frayberg
this
prince
ali
he
a
kind
of
a
rebel
eh
i
do
blame
him
in
a
way
a
normal
man
living
under
those
domes
has
to
let
off
steam
somehow
prince
ali
decided
to
go
out
crusading
i
think
he
would
have
made
it
too
at
least
on
cirgamesç
certainly
there
are
many
more
men
inside
the
domes
when
it
comes
to
fighting
said
murphy
a
sjambak
can
lick
twenty
men
in
a
little
nick
does
hurt
him
but
a
little
nick
bursts
open
a
and
the
man
inside
comes
apart
well
said
the
captain
i
imagine
the
peace
office
will
send
out
a
team
to
put
things
in
order
now
catlin
asked
what
happened
when
you
woke
up
from
the
chloroform
well
nothing
very
much
i
felt
this
attachment
on
my
chest
but
think
much
about
it
still
kinda
woozy
i
was
halfway
through
decompression
they
keep
a
man
there
eight
hours
drop
pressure
on
him
two
pounds
an
hour
nice
and
slow
so
he
do
get
the
bends
was
this
the
same
place
they
took
you
when
you
met
ali
yeah
that
was
their
decompression
chamber
they
had
to
make
a
sjambak
out
of
me
there
was
anywhere
else
they
could
keep
me
well
pretty
soon
my
head
cleared
and
i
saw
this
apparatus
stuck
to
my
chest
he
poked
at
the
mechanism
on
the
table
i
saw
the
oxygen
tank
i
saw
the
blood
running
through
the
plastic
pipes
blue
from
me
to
that
carburetor
arrangement
red
on
the
way
back
in
and
i
figured
out
the
whole
arrangement
carbon
dioxide
still
exhales
up
through
your
lungs
but
the
vein
back
to
the
left
auricle
is
routed
through
the
carburetor
and
supercharged
with
oxygen
a
man
does
need
to
breathe
the
carburetor
flushes
his
blood
with
oxygen
the
decompression
tank
adjusts
him
to
the
lack
of
there
only
one
thing
to
look
out
for
that
not
to
touch
anything
with
your
naked
flesh
if
it
in
the
sunshine
blazing
hot
if
it
in
the
shade
it
cold
enough
to
cut
otherwise
you
free
as
a
bird
but
how
did
you
get
away
i
saw
those
little
and
began
figuring
i
could
go
back
to
singhalût
i
be
lynched
on
sight
as
a
sjambak
i
could
fly
to
another
planet
the
bikes
do
carry
enough
fuel
i
knew
when
the
ship
would
be
coming
in
so
i
figured
i
fly
up
to
meet
it
i
told
the
guard
i
was
going
outside
a
minute
and
i
got
on
one
of
the
there
was
nothing
much
to
it
well
said
frayberg
it
a
great
feature
wilbur
a
great
film
maybe
we
can
stretch
it
into
two
hours
there
one
thing
bothering
me
said
catlin
who
did
the
steward
see
up
here
the
first
time
murphy
shrugged
it
might
have
been
somebody
up
here
skylarking
a
little
too
much
oxygen
and
you
start
cutting
all
kinds
of
capers
or
it
might
have
been
someone
who
decided
he
had
enough
crusading
there
a
sjambak
in
a
cage
right
in
the
middle
of
singhalût
prince
ali
walks
past
they
look
at
each
other
eye
to
eye
ali
smiles
a
little
and
walks
on
suppose
this
sjambak
tried
to
escape
to
the
ship
taken
aboard
turned
over
to
the
sultan
and
the
sultan
makes
an
example
of
him
what
the
sultan
do
to
ali
murphy
shook
his
head
if
i
were
ali
i
disappear
a
loudspeaker
turned
on
attention
all
passengers
we
have
just
passed
through
quarantine
passengers
may
now
disembark
important
no
weapons
or
explosives
allowed
on
singhalût
this
is
where
i
came
in
