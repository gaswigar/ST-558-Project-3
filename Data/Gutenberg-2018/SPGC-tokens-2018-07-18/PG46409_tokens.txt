amidst
the
scenes

so
gracefully
described
in

she
shows
an
underlying
desire

chapter
i
heidi
first
mountain
climb
on
a
bright
june
morning
two
figures
one
a
tall
girl
and
the
other
a
child
could
be
seen
climbing
a
narrow
mountain
path
that
winds
up
from
the
pretty
village
of
mayenfeld
to
the
lofty
heights
of
the
alm
mountain
in
spite
of
the
hot
june
sun
the
child
was
clothed
as
if
to
keep
off
the
bitterest
frost
she
did
not
look
more
than
five
years
old
but
what
her
natural
figure
was
like
would
be
hard
to
say
for
she
had
on
apparently
two
dresses
one
above
the
other
and
over
these
a
thick
red
woolen
shawl
her
small
feet
were
shod
in
thick
nailed
when
the
wayfarers
came
to
the
hamlet
known
as
doerfli
which
is
situated
up
the
mountain
they
met
with
greetings
from
all
sides
for
the
elder
girl
was
now
in
her
old
home
as
they
were
leaving
the
village
a
voice
called
out
wait
a
moment
dete
if
you
are
going
on
up
the
mountain
i
will
come
along
with
you
the
girl
thus
addressed
stood
still
and
the
child
immediately
let
go
her
hand
and
seated
herself
on
the
ground
are
you
tired
heidi
asked
her
companion
no
i
am
hot
answered
the
child
we
shall
soon
get
to
the
top
now
you
must
walk
bravely
on
a
little
longer
and
take
good
long
steps
and
in
another
hour
we
shall
be
there
said
dete
they
were
now
joined
by
a
stout
looking
woman
who
walked
on
ahead
with
her
old
acquaintance
and
where
are
you
going
with
the
child
asked
the
one
who
had
just
joined
the
party
i
suppose
it
is
the
child
your
sister
left
yes
answered
dete
i
am
taking
her
up
to
uncle
where
she
must
stay
this
child
stay
up
there
with
you
must
be
out
of
your
senses
dete
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
the
old
man
however
will
soon
send
you
both
packing
off
home
again
he
can
not
very
well
do
that
seeing
that
he
is
her
grandfather
he
must
do
something
for
her
i
have
had
the
charge
of
the
child
till
now
and
i
can
tell
you
barbel
i
am
not
going
to
give
up
the
chance
which
has
just
fallen
to
me
of
getting
a
good
place
for
her
sake
that
would
be
all
very
well
if
he
were
like
other
people
said
barbel
but
you
know
what
he
is
and
what
can
he
do
with
a
child
especially
with
one
so
young
the
child
can
not
possibly
live
with
him
but
where
are
you
thinking
of
going
yourself
to
frankfurt
where
an
extra
good
place
awaits
me
answered
dete
i
am
glad
i
am
not
the
child
exclaimed
barbel
not
a
creature
knows
anything
about
the
old
man
up
there
he
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
anybody
and
never
sets
his
foot
inside
a
church
from
one
year
end
to
another
when
he
does
come
down
once
in
a
while
everybody
clears
out
of
his
way
the
mere
sight
of
him
with
his
bushy
grey
eyebrows
and
immense
beard
is
alarming
enough
all
kinds
of
things
are
said
about
him
you
dete
however
must
certainly
have
learnt
a
good
deal
concerning
him
from
your
sister
yes
but
i
am
not
going
to
repeat
what
i
heard
suppose
it
should
come
to
his
ears
i
should
get
into
no
end
of
trouble
about
it
barbel
put
her
arm
through
dete
in
a
confidential
sort
of
way
and
said
now
do
just
tell
me
what
is
wrong
with
the
old
man
was
he
always
shunned
as
he
is
now
and
was
he
always
so
cross
i
assure
you
i
will
hold
my
tongue
if
you
will
tell
me
very
well
then
i
will
tell
you
but
just
wait
a
moment
said
dete
looking
around
for
heidi
who
had
slipped
away
unnoticed
i
see
where
she
is
exclaimed
barbel
look
over
there
and
she
pointed
to
a
spot
far
away
from
the
footpath
she
is
climbing
up
the
slope
yonder
with
peter
and
his
goats
but
tell
me
about
the
old
man
did
he
ever
have
anything
more
than
his
two
goats
and
his
hut
i
should
think
so
indeed
replied
dete
with
animation
he
was
at
one
time
the
owner
of
one
of
the
largest
farms
in
domleschg
where
my
mother
used
to
live
but
he
drank
and
gambled
away
the
whole
of
his
property
and
when
this
became
known
to
his
mother
and
father
they
died
of
sorrow
one
shortly
after
the
other
uncle
having
nothing
left
to
him
but
his
bad
name
disappeared
and
it
was
heard
that
he
had
gone
to
naples
as
a
soldier
after
twelve
or
fifteen
years
he
reappeared
in
domleschg
bringing
with
him
a
young
son
whom
he
tried
to
place
with
some
of
his
kinspeople
every
door
however
was
shut
in
his
face
for
no
one
wished
to
have
any
more
to
do
with
him
embittered
by
this
treatment
he
vowed
never
to
set
foot
in
domleschg
again
and
he
then
came
to
doerfli
where
he
lived
with
his
little
boy
his
wife
it
seemed
had
died
shortly
after
the
child
birth
he
must
have
accumulated
some
money
during
his
absence
for
he
apprenticed
his
son
tobias
to
a
carpenter
he
was
a
steady
lad
and
kindly
received
by
every
one
in
doerfli
his
father
however
was
still
looked
upon
with
suspicion
and
it
was
even
rumored
that
he
had
killed
a
man
in
some
brawl
at
naples
but
why
does
everyone
call
him
uncle
surely
he
ca
be
uncle
to
everyone
living
in
doerfli
asked
barbel
our
grandmothers
were
related
so
we
used
to
call
him
uncle
and
as
my
father
had
family
connections
with
so
many
people
in
doerfli
soon
everyone
fell
into
the
habit
of
calling
him
uncle
explained
dete
and
what
happened
to
tobias
further
questioned
barbel
who
was
listening
with
deep
interest
tobias
was
taught
his
trade
in
mels
and
when
he
had
served
his
apprenticeship
he
came
back
to
doerfli
and
married
my
sister
adelaide
but
their
happiness
did
not
last
long
two
years
after
their
marriage
tobias
was
killed
in
an
accident
his
wife
was
so
overcome
with
grief
that
she
fell
into
a
fever
from
which
she
never
recovered
she
had
always
been
rather
delicate
and
subject
to
curious
attacks
during
which
no
one
knew
whether
she
was
awake
or
sleeping
and
so
two
months
after
tobias
had
been
carried
to
the
grave
his
wife
followed
him
their
sad
fate
was
the
talk
of
everybody
far
and
near
and
the
general
opinion
was
expressed
that
it
was
a
punishment
which
uncle
deserved
for
the
godless
life
he
had
led
our
minister
endeavored
to
awaken
his
conscience
but
the
old
man
grew
only
more
wrathful
and
stubborn
and
would
not
speak
to
a
soul
all
at
once
we
heard
that
he
had
gone
to
live
up
on
the
alm
mountain
and
that
he
did
not
intend
to
come
down
again
since
then
he
has
led
his
solitary
life
up
there
and
everyone
knows
him
now
by
the
name
of
mother
and
i
took
little
one
then
only
a
year
old
into
our
care
when
mother
died
last
year
and
i
went
down
to
the
baths
to
earn
some
money
i
paid
old
ursel
to
take
care
of
her
so
you
see
i
have
done
my
duty
now
it
turn
but
where
are
you
going
to
yourself
barbel
we
are
now
half
way
up
the
alm
we
have
just
reached
the
place
i
wanted
answered
barbel
i
must
see
peter
mother
who
is
doing
some
spinning
for
me
so
dete
and
good
luck
to
you
she
went
toward
a
small
dark
brown
hut
which
stood
a
few
steps
away
from
the
path
in
a
hollow
that
afforded
it
some
protection
from
the
mountain
wind
here
lived
peter
the
boy
with
his
mother
brigitta
and
his
blind
grandmother
who
was
known
to
all
the
old
and
young
in
the
neighborhood
as
just
grandmother
every
morning
peter
went
down
to
doerfli
to
bring
up
a
flock
of
goats
to
browse
on
the
mountain
at
sundown
he
went
skipping
down
the
mountain
again
with
his
animals
when
he
reached
doerfli
he
would
give
a
shrill
whistle
whereupon
all
the
owners
of
the
goats
would
come
out
to
take
home
the
animals
that
belonged
to
them
dete
had
been
standing
for
a
good
ten
minutes
looking
about
her
in
every
direction
for
some
sign
of
the
children
and
the
goats
meanwhile
heidi
and
the
goatherd
were
climbing
up
by
a
far
and
roundabout
way
for
peter
knew
many
spots
where
all
kinds
of
good
food
in
the
shape
of
shrubs
and
plants
grew
for
his
goats
the
child
exhausted
with
the
heat
and
weight
of
her
thick
clothes
panted
and
struggled
after
him
at
first
with
some
difficulty
she
said
nothing
but
her
little
eyes
kept
watching
first
peter
as
he
sprang
nimbly
hither
and
thither
on
his
bare
feet
clad
only
in
his
short
light
breeches
and
then
the
goats
that
went
leaping
over
rocks
and
shrubs
all
at
once
she
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
began
pulling
off
her
shoes
and
stockings
then
she
unwound
the
hot
red
shawl
and
took
off
her
frock
but
there
was
still
another
to
unfasten
for
dete
had
put
the
sunday
dress
on
over
the
everyday
one
to
save
the
trouble
of
carrying
it
quick
as
lightning
the
everyday
frock
followed
the
other
and
now
the
child
stood
up
clad
only
in
her
light
under
garment
she
stretched
out
her
little
bare
arms
with
glee
leaving
all
her
clothes
together
in
a
tidy
little
heap
she
went
jumping
and
climbing
up
after
peter
and
the
goats
as
nimbly
as
any
of
the
party
now
that
heidi
was
able
to
move
at
her
ease
she
began
to
enter
into
conversation
with
peter
she
asked
him
how
many
goats
he
had
where
he
was
going
to
with
them
and
what
he
had
to
do
when
he
arrived
there
at
last
after
some
time
they
came
within
view
of
dete
hardly
had
the
latter
caught
sight
of
the
little
company
climbing
up
towards
her
when
she
shrieked
out
heidi
what
have
you
been
doing
what
a
sight
you
have
made
of
yourself
and
where
are
your
two
frocks
and
the
red
wrapper
and
the
new
shoes
i
bought
and
the
new
stockings
i
knitted
for
you
everything
gone
not
a
thing
left
what
can
you
have
been
thinking
of
heidi
where
are
all
your
clothes
the
child
quietly
pointed
to
a
spot
below
on
the
mountain
side
and
answered
down
there
you
little
thing
exclaimed
dete
angrily
what
could
have
put
it
into
your
head
to
do
that
what
made
you
undress
yourself
what
do
you
mean
by
it
i
do
want
any
clothes
said
heidi
illustration
you
wretched
thoughtless
child
have
you
no
sense
in
you
at
all
continued
dete
scolding
and
lamenting
peter
you
go
down
and
fetch
them
for
me
as
quickly
as
you
can
and
you
shall
have
something
nice
and
she
held
out
a
bright
new
piece
of
money
to
him
that
sparkled
in
the
sun
peter
was
immediately
off
down
the
steep
mountain
side
taking
the
shortest
cut
and
was
back
again
so
quickly
with
the
clothes
that
even
dete
was
obliged
to
give
him
a
word
of
praise
as
she
handed
him
the
promised
money
peter
promptly
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
his
face
beamed
with
delight
for
it
was
not
often
that
he
was
the
happy
possessor
of
such
riches
you
can
carry
the
things
up
for
me
as
far
as
uncle
as
you
are
going
the
same
way
went
on
dete
who
was
preparing
to
continue
her
climb
up
the
mountain
side
which
rose
in
a
steep
ascent
immediately
behind
the
goatherd
hut
peter
willingly
undertook
to
do
this
and
followed
after
her
after
a
climb
of
more
than
of
an
hour
they
reached
the
top
of
the
alm
mountain
uncle
hut
stood
on
a
projection
of
the
rock
exposed
indeed
to
the
winds
but
where
every
ray
of
sun
could
rest
upon
it
and
a
full
view
could
be
had
of
the
valley
beneath
behind
the
hut
stood
three
old
fir
trees
with
long
thick
unlopped
branches
beyond
these
rose
a
further
wall
of
mountain
the
lower
heights
still
overgrown
with
beautiful
grass
and
plants
against
the
hut
on
the
side
looking
towards
the
valley
uncle
had
put
up
a
seat
here
he
was
sitting
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
his
hands
on
his
knees
quietly
looking
out
when
the
children
the
goats
and
dete
suddenly
clambered
into
view
heidi
was
at
the
top
first
she
went
straight
up
to
the
old
man
put
out
her
hand
and
said
grandfather
so
so
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
asked
gruffly
as
he
gave
the
child
an
abrupt
shake
of
the
hand
and
gazed
at
her
from
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
heidi
stared
steadily
back
at
him
in
return
with
unflinching
gaze
meanwhile
dete
had
come
up
with
peter
after
her
i
wish
you
uncle
said
dete
as
she
walked
towards
him
and
i
have
brought
you
tobias
and
adelaide
child
you
will
hardly
recognize
her
as
you
have
never
seen
her
since
she
was
a
year
old
and
what
has
the
child
to
do
with
me
up
here
asked
the
old
man
curtly
you
there
he
then
called
out
to
peter
be
off
with
your
goats
you
are
none
too
early
as
it
is
and
take
mine
with
you
peter
obeyed
on
the
instant
and
quickly
disappeared
the
child
is
here
to
remain
with
you
dete
made
answer
i
have
done
my
duty
by
her
for
these
four
years
and
now
it
is
time
for
you
to
do
yours
that
it
is
it
said
the
old
man
as
he
looked
at
her
with
a
flash
in
his
eye
and
when
the
child
begins
to
fret
and
whine
after
you
what
am
i
to
do
with
her
then
that
your
affair
retorted
dete
if
you
can
not
arrange
to
keep
her
do
with
her
as
you
like
you
will
be
answerable
for
the
result
if
harm
happens
to
her
though
you
have
hardly
need
to
add
to
the
burden
already
on
your
conscience
now
dete
was
not
quite
easy
in
her
own
conscience
about
what
she
was
doing
and
consequently
was
feeling
hot
and
irritable
and
said
more
than
she
had
intended
as
she
uttered
her
last
words
uncle
rose
from
his
seat
he
looked
at
her
in
a
way
that
made
her
draw
back
a
step
or
two
then
flinging
out
his
arm
he
said
to
her
in
a
commanding
voice
be
off
with
you
this
instant
and
get
back
as
quickly
as
you
can
to
the
place
whence
you
came
and
do
not
let
me
see
your
face
again
in
a
hurry
dete
did
not
wait
to
be
told
twice
to
you
then
and
to
you
too
heidi
she
called
as
she
turned
quickly
away
and
started
to
descend
the
mountain
at
a
running
pace
which
she
did
not
slacken
till
she
found
herself
safely
again
at
doerfli
chapter
ii
a
new
home
with
grandfather
as
soon
as
dete
had
disappeared
the
old
man
went
back
to
his
bench
and
there
he
remained
seated
staring
at
the
ground
without
uttering
a
sound
while
thick
curls
of
smoke
floated
upward
from
his
pipe
heidi
meanwhile
was
enjoying
herself
in
her
new
surroundings
she
looked
about
till
she
found
a
shed
built
against
the
hut
where
the
goats
were
kept
she
peeped
in
and
saw
it
was
empty
she
continued
her
search
but
presently
came
back
to
where
her
grandfather
was
sitting
seeing
that
he
was
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
when
she
left
him
she
went
and
placed
herself
in
front
of
the
old
man
and
said
i
want
to
see
what
you
have
inside
the
house
come
then
and
the
grandfather
rose
and
went
before
her
towards
the
hut
bring
your
bundle
of
clothes
in
with
you
he
bid
her
as
she
was
following
i
sha
want
them
any
more
was
her
prompt
answer
the
old
man
turned
and
looked
searchingly
at
the
child
whose
dark
eyes
were
sparkling
in
delighted
anticipation
of
what
she
was
going
to
see
inside
she
is
certainly
not
wanting
in
intelligence
he
murmured
to
himself
and
why
shall
you
not
want
them
any
more
he
asked
aloud
because
i
want
to
go
about
like
the
goats
with
their
thin
light
legs
well
you
can
do
so
if
you
like
said
her
grandfather
but
bring
the
things
in
we
must
put
them
in
the
cupboard
heidi
did
as
she
was
told
the
old
man
now
opened
the
door
and
heidi
stepped
inside
after
him
she
found
herself
in
a
room
which
covered
the
whole
ground
floor
of
the
hut
a
table
and
a
chair
were
the
only
furniture
in
one
corner
stood
the
grandfather
bed
in
another
was
the
hearth
with
a
large
kettle
hanging
above
it
and
on
the
further
side
was
a
large
door
in
the
wall
this
was
the
cupboard
the
grandfather
opened
it
inside
were
his
clothes
on
a
second
shelf
were
some
plates
and
cups
and
glasses
and
on
a
higher
one
still
a
round
loaf
smoked
meat
and
cheese
for
everything
that
needed
for
his
food
and
clothing
was
kept
in
this
cupboard
heidi
thrust
in
her
bundle
of
clothes
as
far
back
behind
her
grandfather
things
as
possible
so
that
they
might
not
easily
be
found
again
she
then
looked
carefully
round
the
room
and
asked
where
am
i
to
sleep
grandfather
wherever
you
like
he
answered
heidi
was
delighted
and
began
at
once
to
examine
all
the
nooks
and
corners
to
find
out
where
it
would
be
pleasantest
to
sleep
in
the
corner
near
her
grandfather
bed
she
saw
a
short
ladder
against
the
wall
up
she
climbed
and
found
herself
in
the
there
lay
a
large
heap
of
fresh
hay
while
through
a
round
window
in
the
wall
she
could
see
right
down
the
valley
i
shall
sleep
up
here
grandfather
she
called
down
to
him
lovely
up
here
come
up
and
see
how
lovely
it
is
oh
i
know
all
about
it
he
called
up
in
answer
i
am
getting
the
bed
ready
now
she
called
down
again
as
she
went
busily
to
and
fro
at
her
work
but
i
shall
want
you
to
bring
me
up
a
sheet
you
ca
have
a
bed
without
a
sheet
you
want
it
to
lie
upon
all
right
said
the
grandfather
and
presently
he
went
to
the
cupboard
and
after
rummaging
about
inside
for
a
few
minutes
he
drew
out
a
long
coarse
piece
of
stuff
which
was
all
he
had
to
do
duty
for
a
sheet
he
carried
it
up
to
the
loft
where
he
found
heidi
had
already
made
quite
a
nice
bed
she
had
put
an
extra
heap
of
hay
at
one
end
for
a
pillow
and
had
so
arranged
it
that
when
in
bed
she
would
be
able
to
see
comfortably
out
through
the
round
window
that
is
capital
said
her
grandfather
now
we
must
put
on
the
sheet
they
spread
it
over
the
bed
and
where
it
was
too
long
or
too
broad
heidi
quickly
tucked
it
in
under
the
hay
it
looked
as
tidy
and
comfortable
a
bed
as
you
could
wish
for
and
heidi
stood
gazing
thoughtfully
at
her
handiwork
we
have
forgotten
something
now
grandfather
she
said
after
a
short
silence
what
that
he
asked
a
coverlid
when
you
get
into
bed
you
have
to
creep
in
between
the
sheet
and
the
coverlid
oh
that
the
way
is
it
but
suppose
i
have
not
got
a
coverlid
said
the
old
man
well
never
mind
grandfather
said
heidi
in
a
consoling
tone
of
voice
i
can
take
some
more
hay
to
put
over
me
and
she
was
turning
quickly
to
fetch
another
armful
from
the
heap
when
her
grandfather
stopped
her
wait
a
moment
he
said
and
he
climbed
down
the
ladder
again
and
went
towards
his
bed
he
returned
to
the
loft
with
a
large
thick
sack
made
of
flax
which
he
laid
tidily
over
the
bed
that
is
a
splendid
coverlid
said
heidi
and
the
bed
looks
lovely
altogether
i
wish
it
was
night
so
that
i
might
get
inside
it
at
once
i
think
we
had
better
go
down
and
have
something
to
eat
first
said
the
grandfather
while
the
kettle
was
boiling
the
old
man
held
a
large
piece
of
cheese
on
a
long
iron
fork
over
the
fire
turning
it
round
and
round
till
it
was
toasted
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
on
each
side
heidi
watched
all
that
was
going
on
with
eager
curiosity
suddenly
some
new
idea
seemed
to
come
into
her
head
for
she
turned
and
ran
to
the
cupboard
and
then
began
going
busily
backwards
and
forwards
presently
the
grandfather
got
up
and
came
to
the
table
with
a
jug
and
the
cheese
and
there
he
saw
it
already
tidily
laid
with
the
round
loaf
and
two
plates
and
two
knives
each
in
its
right
place
ah
that
right
said
the
grandfather
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
have
some
ideas
of
your
own
and
as
he
spoke
he
laid
the
toasted
cheese
on
a
layer
of
bread
but
there
is
still
something
missing
heidi
looked
at
the
jug
that
was
steaming
away
invitingly
and
ran
quickly
back
to
the
cupboard
at
first
she
could
only
see
a
small
bowl
left
on
the
shelf
but
she
was
not
long
in
perplexity
for
a
moment
later
she
caught
sight
of
two
glasses
further
back
and
without
an
instant
loss
of
time
she
returned
with
these
and
the
bowl
and
put
them
down
on
the
table
good
i
see
you
know
how
to
set
about
things
but
what
will
you
do
for
a
seat
the
grandfather
himself
was
sitting
on
the
only
chair
in
the
room
heidi
flew
to
the
hearth
and
dragging
the
stool
up
to
the
table
sat
herself
down
upon
it
the
grandfather
filled
the
bowl
with
milk
and
pushed
it
in
front
of
heidi
then
he
brought
her
a
large
slice
of
bread
and
a
piece
of
the
golden
cheese
and
told
her
to
eat
heidi
lifted
the
bowl
with
both
hands
and
drank
without
pause
till
it
was
empty
for
the
thirst
of
all
her
long
hot
journey
had
returned
upon
her
then
she
drew
a
deep
breath
in
the
eagerness
of
her
thirst
she
had
not
stopped
to
breathe
and
put
down
the
bowl
was
the
milk
nice
he
asked
i
never
drank
any
so
good
before
answered
heidi
then
you
must
have
some
more
and
the
old
man
filled
her
bowl
again
to
the
brim
and
set
it
before
the
child
who
was
now
hungrily
beginning
her
bread
having
first
spread
it
with
the
cheese
which
after
being
toasted
was
soft
as
butter
the
meal
being
over
the
grandfather
went
outside
to
put
the
in
order
and
heidi
watched
with
interest
while
he
first
swept
it
out
and
then
put
fresh
straw
for
the
goats
to
sleep
upon
then
he
went
to
the
little
and
there
he
cut
some
long
round
sticks
and
a
small
round
board
in
this
he
bored
some
holes
and
stuck
the
sticks
into
them
and
there
as
if
made
by
magic
was
a
stool
just
like
her
grandfather
only
higher
heidi
stood
and
looked
at
it
speechless
with
astonishment
what
do
you
think
that
is
asked
her
grandfather
it
my
stool
i
know
because
it
is
such
a
high
one
and
it
was
made
all
of
a
minute
said
the
child
still
lost
in
wonder
and
admiration
she
understands
what
she
sees
her
eyes
are
in
the
right
place
remarked
the
grandfather
to
himself
and
so
the
time
passed
happily
on
till
evening
then
the
wind
began
to
roar
louder
than
ever
through
the
old
fir
trees
heidi
listened
with
delight
to
the
sound
and
it
filled
her
heart
so
full
of
gladness
that
she
skipped
and
danced
round
the
old
trees
as
if
some
unheard
of
joy
had
come
to
her
the
grandfather
stood
and
watched
her
from
the
shed
illustration
heidi
tenderly
stroked
the
two
goats
in
turn
suddenly
a
shrill
whistle
was
heard
down
from
the
heights
above
the
goats
came
springing
one
after
another
with
peter
in
their
midst
heidi
sprang
forward
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
rushed
among
the
flock
greeting
first
one
and
then
another
of
her
old
friends
of
the
morning
as
they
neared
the
hut
the
goats
stood
still
and
then
two
of
their
number
two
beautiful
slender
animals
one
white
and
one
brown
ran
forward
to
where
the
grandfather
was
standing
and
began
licking
his
hands
for
he
was
holding
a
little
salt
which
he
always
had
ready
for
his
goats
on
their
return
home
peter
went
on
down
the
mountain
with
the
remainder
of
his
flock
heidi
tenderly
stroked
the
two
goats
in
turn
jumping
about
in
her
glee
at
the
pretty
little
animals
are
they
ours
grandfather
are
they
both
ours
are
you
going
to
put
them
in
the
shed
will
they
always
stay
with
us
heidi
questions
came
tumbling
out
one
after
the
other
so
that
her
grandfather
had
only
time
to
answer
each
of
them
with
yes
yes
when
the
goats
had
finished
licking
up
the
salt
her
grandfather
told
her
to
go
and
fetch
her
bowl
and
the
bread
heidi
obeyed
and
was
soon
back
again
the
grandfather
milked
the
white
goat
and
filled
her
basin
and
then
breaking
off
a
piece
of
bread
now
eat
your
supper
he
said
and
then
go
up
to
bed
dete
left
another
little
bundle
for
you
with
a
nightgown
and
other
small
things
in
it
which
you
will
find
at
the
bottom
of
the
cupboard
if
you
want
them
i
must
go
and
shut
up
the
goats
so
be
off
and
sleep
well
grandfather
what
are
their
names
grandfather
what
are
their
names
she
called
out
as
she
ran
after
his
retreating
figure
and
the
goats
the
white
one
is
named
little
swan
and
the
brown
one
little
bear
he
answered
little
swan
little
bear
she
called
again
at
the
top
of
her
voice
then
she
ate
her
supper
and
went
indoors
and
climbed
up
to
her
bed
where
she
was
soon
lying
as
sweetly
and
soundly
asleep
as
any
young
princess
on
her
couch
of
silk
chapter
iii
little
bear
and
little
swan
heidi
felt
very
happy
next
morning
as
she
woke
up
in
her
new
home
and
remembered
all
the
many
things
that
she
had
seen
the
day
before
and
which
she
would
see
again
that
day
and
above
all
she
thought
with
delight
of
the
dear
goats
she
jumped
quickly
out
of
bed
and
a
very
few
minutes
sufficed
her
to
put
on
the
clothes
which
she
had
taken
off
the
night
before
for
there
were
not
many
of
them
then
she
climbed
down
the
ladder
and
ran
outside
the
hut
there
stood
peter
already
with
his
flock
of
goats
and
the
grandfather
was
just
bringing
his
two
out
of
the
shed
to
join
the
others
heidi
ran
forward
to
wish
to
him
and
the
goats
do
you
want
to
go
with
them
on
to
the
mountain
asked
her
grandfather
nothing
could
have
pleased
heidi
better
and
she
jumped
for
joy
in
answer
the
grandfather
went
inside
the
hut
calling
to
peter
to
follow
him
and
bring
in
his
wallet
peter
obeyed
with
astonishment
and
laid
down
the
little
bag
which
held
his
meagre
dinner
open
it
said
the
old
man
and
he
put
in
a
large
piece
of
bread
and
an
equally
large
piece
of
cheese
which
made
peter
open
his
eyes
for
each
was
twice
the
size
of
the
two
portions
which
he
had
for
his
own
dinner
there
now
there
is
only
the
little
bowl
to
add
continued
the
grandfather
for
the
child
can
not
drink
her
milk
as
you
do
from
the
goat
she
is
not
accustomed
to
that
you
must
milk
two
bowlfuls
for
her
when
she
has
her
dinner
for
she
is
going
with
you
and
will
remain
with
you
till
you
return
this
evening
but
take
care
she
does
not
fall
over
any
of
the
rocks
do
you
hear
they
started
joyfully
for
the
mountain
heidi
went
running
hither
and
thither
and
shouting
with
delight
for
here
were
whole
patches
of
delicate
red
primroses
and
there
the
blue
gleam
of
the
lovely
gentian
while
above
them
all
laughed
and
nodded
the
golden
cistus
enchanted
with
all
this
waving
field
of
flowers
heidi
forgot
even
peter
and
the
goats
she
ran
on
in
front
and
then
off
to
the
side
tempted
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
as
she
caught
sight
of
some
bright
spot
of
glowing
red
or
yellow
and
all
the
while
she
was
plucking
whole
handfuls
of
the
flowers
which
she
put
into
her
little
apron
for
she
wanted
to
take
them
all
home
and
stick
them
in
the
hay
so
that
she
might
make
her
bedroom
look
just
like
the
meadows
outside
peter
had
therefore
to
be
on
the
alert
and
his
round
eyes
which
did
not
move
very
quickly
had
more
work
than
they
could
well
manage
for
the
goats
were
as
lively
as
heidi
they
ran
in
all
directions
and
peter
had
to
follow
whistling
and
calling
and
swinging
his
stick
to
get
all
the
runaways
together
again
finally
they
arrived
at
the
spot
where
peter
generally
halted
for
his
goats
to
pasture
and
where
he
took
up
his
quarters
for
the
day
it
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
high
rocks
which
were
covered
for
some
distance
up
by
bushes
and
fir
trees
beyond
which
rose
their
bare
and
rugged
summits
on
one
side
of
the
mountain
the
rock
was
split
into
deep
clefts
and
the
grandfather
had
reason
to
warn
peter
of
danger
having
climbed
as
far
as
the
peter
unslung
his
wallet
and
put
it
carefully
in
a
little
hollow
of
the
ground
for
he
knew
what
the
wind
was
like
up
there
and
did
not
want
to
see
his
precious
belonging
sent
rolling
down
the
mountain
by
a
sudden
gust
then
he
threw
himself
at
full
length
on
the
warm
ground
and
soon
fell
asleep
heidi
meanwhile
had
unfastened
her
apron
and
rolling
it
carefully
round
the
flowers
laid
it
beside
peter
wallet
inside
the
hollow
she
then
sat
down
beside
his
outstretched
figure
and
looked
about
her
the
goats
were
climbing
about
among
the
bushes
overhead
she
had
never
felt
so
happy
in
her
life
before
she
drank
in
the
golden
sunlight
the
fresh
air
the
sweet
smell
of
the
flowers
and
wished
for
nothing
better
than
to
remain
there
forever
suddenly
she
heard
a
loud
harsh
cry
overhead
and
lifting
her
eyes
she
saw
a
bird
larger
than
any
she
had
ever
seen
before
with
great
spreading
wings
wheeling
round
in
wide
circles
and
uttering
a
piercing
croaking
kind
of
sound
above
her
peter
peter
wake
up
called
out
heidi
see
the
great
bird
is
there
look
look
peter
got
up
on
hearing
her
call
and
together
they
sat
and
watched
the
bird
which
rose
higher
and
higher
in
the
blue
air
till
it
disappeared
behind
the
grey
where
has
it
gone
to
asked
heidi
who
had
followed
the
movements
with
intense
interest
home
to
its
nest
said
peter
is
his
home
right
up
there
oh
how
nice
to
be
up
so
high
why
does
he
make
that
noise
because
he
ca
help
it
explained
peter
let
us
climb
up
there
and
see
where
his
nest
is
proposed
heidi
oh
oh
oh
exclaimed
peter
his
disapproval
of
heidi
suggestion
becoming
more
marked
with
each
ejaculation
why
even
the
goats
can
not
climb
as
high
as
that
besides
did
uncle
say
that
you
were
not
to
fall
over
the
rocks
peter
now
began
suddenly
whistling
and
calling
in
such
a
loud
manner
that
heidi
could
not
think
what
was
happening
but
the
goats
evidently
understood
his
voice
for
one
after
the
other
they
came
springing
down
the
rocks
until
they
were
all
assembled
on
the
green
plateau
illustration
heidi
jumped
up
and
ran
in
and
out
among
them
for
it
was
new
to
her
to
see
the
goats
playing
together
like
this
meanwhile
peter
had
taken
the
wallet
out
of
the
hollow
and
placed
the
pieces
of
bread
and
cheese
on
the
ground
in
the
shape
of
a
square
the
larger
two
on
heidi
side
and
the
smaller
on
his
own
for
he
knew
exactly
which
were
hers
and
which
his
then
he
took
the
little
bowl
and
milked
some
delicious
fresh
milk
into
it
from
the
white
goat
and
afterwards
set
the
bowl
in
the
middle
of
the
square
leave
off
jumping
about
it
is
time
for
dinner
said
peter
sit
down
now
and
begin
heidi
sat
down
is
the
milk
for
me
she
asked
illustration
heidi
drank
in
the
golden
sunlight
the
fresh
air
and
the
sweet
smell
of
the
flowers
yes
replied
peter
and
the
two
large
pieces
of
bread
and
cheese
are
yours
also
and
when
you
have
drunk
up
that
milk
you
are
to
have
another
bowlful
from
the
white
goat
and
then
it
will
be
my
turn
and
which
do
you
get
your
milk
from
inquired
heidi
from
my
own
goat
the
piebald
one
but
go
on
now
with
your
dinner
said
peter
again
reminding
her
it
was
time
to
eat
heidi
took
up
the
bowl
and
drank
her
milk
and
as
soon
as
she
had
put
it
down
empty
peter
rose
and
filled
it
again
for
her
then
she
broke
off
a
piece
of
her
bread
and
held
out
the
remainder
which
was
still
larger
than
peter
own
piece
together
with
the
whole
big
slice
of
cheese
to
her
companion
saying
you
can
have
that
i
have
plenty
peter
looked
at
heidi
unable
to
speak
for
astonishment
he
hesitated
a
moment
for
he
could
not
believe
that
heidi
was
in
earnest
but
the
latter
kept
on
holding
out
the
bread
and
cheese
and
as
peter
still
did
not
take
it
she
laid
it
down
on
his
knees
he
saw
then
that
she
really
meant
it
he
seized
the
food
nodded
his
thanks
and
acceptance
of
her
present
and
then
made
a
more
splendid
meal
than
he
had
known
ever
since
he
was
a
heidi
the
while
still
continued
to
watch
the
goats
tell
me
all
their
names
she
said
peter
knew
these
by
heart
so
he
began
telling
heidi
the
name
of
each
goat
in
turn
as
he
pointed
it
out
to
her
she
listened
with
great
attention
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
could
herself
distinguish
the
goats
from
one
another
and
could
call
each
by
name
for
every
goat
had
its
own
peculiarities
which
could
not
easily
be
mistaken
there
was
the
great
turk
with
his
big
horns
who
was
always
wanting
to
butt
the
others
so
that
most
of
them
ran
away
when
they
saw
him
coming
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
rough
companion
only
greenfinch
the
slender
nimble
little
goat
was
brave
enough
to
face
him
and
would
make
a
rush
at
him
three
or
four
times
in
succession
then
there
was
little
white
snowflake
who
bleated
in
such
a
plaintive
and
beseeching
manner
that
heidi
already
had
several
times
run
to
it
and
taken
its
head
in
her
hands
to
comfort
it
just
at
this
moment
the
pleading
young
cry
was
heard
again
and
heidi
jumped
up
running
and
putting
her
arms
around
the
little
creature
neck
asked
in
a
sympathetic
voice
what
is
it
little
snowflake
why
do
you
call
like
that
as
if
in
trouble
the
goat
pressed
closer
to
heidi
in
a
confiding
way
and
left
off
bleating
peter
called
out
from
where
he
was
sitting
for
he
had
not
yet
got
to
the
end
of
his
bread
and
cheese
she
cries
like
that
because
the
old
goat
is
not
with
her
she
was
sold
at
mayenfeld
the
day
before
yesterday
and
so
will
not
come
up
the
mountain
any
more
who
is
the
old
goat
called
heidi
back
why
her
mother
of
course
was
the
answer
where
is
the
grandmother
called
heidi
again
she
has
none
and
the
grandfather
she
has
none
oh
you
poor
little
snowflake
exclaimed
heidi
clasping
the
animal
gently
to
her
but
do
not
cry
like
that
any
more
see
now
i
shall
come
up
here
with
you
every
day
so
that
you
will
not
be
alone
any
more
and
if
you
want
anything
you
have
only
to
come
to
me
the
goats
were
now
beginning
to
climb
the
rocks
again
each
seeking
for
the
plants
it
liked
in
its
own
fashion
some
jumping
over
everything
they
met
till
they
found
what
they
wanted
others
going
more
carefully
and
cropping
all
the
nice
leaves
by
the
way
the
turk
still
now
and
then
giving
the
others
a
poke
with
his
horns
little
swan
and
little
bear
clambered
lightly
up
and
never
failed
to
find
the
best
bushes
and
then
they
would
stand
gracefully
poised
on
their
pretty
legs
delicately
nibbling
at
the
leaves
heidi
stood
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
carefully
noting
all
they
did
peter
she
said
to
the
boy
who
had
again
thrown
himself
down
on
the
ground
the
prettiest
of
all
the
goats
are
little
swan
and
little
bear
yes
i
know
they
are
was
the
answer
brushes
them
down
and
washes
them
and
gives
them
salt
and
he
has
the
nicest
shed
for
them
all
of
a
sudden
peter
leaped
to
his
feet
and
ran
hastily
after
the
goats
heidi
followed
him
as
fast
as
she
could
for
she
was
too
eager
to
know
what
had
happened
to
stay
behind
peter
dashed
through
the
middle
of
the
flock
towards
that
side
of
the
mountain
where
the
rocks
fell
perpendicularly
to
a
great
depth
below
and
where
any
thoughtless
goat
if
it
went
too
near
might
fall
over
and
break
all
its
legs
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
inquisitive
greenfinch
taking
leaps
in
that
direction
and
he
was
only
just
in
time
for
the
animal
had
already
sprung
to
the
edge
of
the
abyss
all
peter
could
do
was
to
throw
himself
down
and
seize
one
of
her
hind
legs
greenfinch
thus
taken
by
surprise
began
bleating
furiously
angry
at
being
held
so
fast
and
prevented
from
continuing
her
voyage
of
discovery
she
struggled
to
get
loose
and
endeavored
so
obstinately
to
leap
forward
that
peter
shouted
to
heidi
to
come
and
help
him
for
he
could
not
get
up
and
was
afraid
of
pulling
out
the
goat
leg
altogether
heidi
had
already
run
up
and
she
saw
at
once
the
danger
both
peter
and
the
animal
were
in
she
quickly
gathered
a
bunch
of
leaves
and
then
holding
them
under
greenfinch
nose
said
coaxingly
come
come
greenfinch
you
must
not
be
naughty
look
you
might
fall
down
there
and
break
your
leg
and
that
would
give
you
dreadful
pain
the
young
animal
turned
quickly
and
began
contentedly
eating
the
leaves
out
of
heidi
hand
meanwhile
peter
got
on
to
his
feet
again
and
took
hold
of
greenfinch
by
the
band
round
her
neck
from
which
her
bell
was
hung
and
heidi
taking
hold
of
her
in
the
same
way
on
the
other
side
they
led
the
wanderer
back
to
the
rest
of
the
flock
that
had
remained
peacefully
feeding
peter
now
he
had
his
goat
in
safety
lifted
his
stick
in
order
to
give
her
a
good
beating
as
punishment
and
greenfinch
seeing
what
was
coming
shrank
back
in
fear
but
heidi
cried
out
no
no
peter
you
must
not
strike
her
see
how
frightened
she
is
she
deserves
it
growled
peter
and
again
lifted
his
stick
then
heidi
flung
herself
against
him
and
cried
indignantly
you
have
no
right
to
touch
her
it
will
hurt
her
let
her
alone
peter
looked
with
surprise
at
the
commanding
little
figure
whose
dark
eyes
were
flashing
and
reluctantly
he
let
his
stick
drop
well
i
will
let
her
off
if
you
will
give
me
some
more
of
your
cheese
tomorrow
he
said
for
he
was
determined
to
have
something
to
make
up
to
him
for
his
fright
you
shall
have
it
all
tomorrow
and
every
day
i
do
not
want
it
replied
heidi
giving
ready
consent
to
his
demand
and
i
will
give
you
bread
as
well
a
large
piece
like
you
had
today
but
then
you
must
promise
never
to
beat
greenfinch
or
snowflake
or
any
of
the
goats
all
right
said
peter
i
do
care
which
meant
that
he
would
agree
to
the
bargain
and
let
go
of
greenfinch
who
joyfully
sprang
to
join
her
companions
and
thus
imperceptibly
the
day
had
crept
on
to
its
close
and
now
the
sun
was
on
the
point
of
sinking
out
of
sight
behind
the
high
mountains
heidi
was
again
sitting
on
the
ground
when
all
at
once
she
sprang
to
her
feet
peter
peter
everything
is
on
fire
all
the
rocks
are
burning
and
the
great
snow
mountain
and
the
sky
o
look
look
the
high
rock
up
there
is
red
with
flame
o
the
beautiful
fiery
snow
stand
up
peter
see
the
fire
has
reached
the
great
bird
nest
look
at
the
rocks
look
at
the
fir
trees
everything
everything
is
on
fire
it
is
always
like
that
said
peter
composedly
continuing
to
peel
his
stick
but
it
is
not
really
fire
what
is
it
then
cried
heidi
it
gets
like
that
of
itself
explained
peter
look
look
cried
heidi
in
fresh
excitement
now
they
have
turned
all
rose
color
look
at
that
one
covered
with
snow
and
that
with
the
high
pointed
rocks
what
do
you
call
them
mountains
have
not
any
names
he
answered
o
how
beautiful
look
at
the
crimson
snow
and
up
there
on
the
rocks
there
are
ever
so
many
roses
oh
now
they
are
turning
grey
oh
oh
now
all
the
color
has
died
away
it
all
gone
peter
and
heidi
sat
down
on
the
ground
looking
as
full
of
distress
as
if
everything
had
really
come
to
an
end
it
will
come
again
tomorrow
said
peter
get
up
we
must
go
home
now
he
whistled
to
his
goats
and
together
they
all
started
on
their
homeward
way
is
it
like
that
every
day
shall
we
see
it
every
day
when
we
bring
the
goats
up
here
asked
heidi
as
she
clambered
down
the
mountain
at
peter
side
she
waited
eagerly
for
his
answer
hoping
that
he
would
tell
her
it
was
so
it
is
like
that
most
days
he
replied
but
will
it
be
like
that
tomorrow
for
certain
heidi
persisted
yes
yes
tomorrow
for
certain
peter
assured
her
in
answer
heidi
now
felt
quite
happy
again
and
her
little
brain
was
so
full
of
new
impressions
and
new
thoughts
that
she
did
not
speak
any
more
until
they
had
reached
the
hut
the
grandfather
was
sitting
under
the
fir
trees
where
he
had
put
up
a
new
seat
heidi
ran
up
to
him
followed
by
the
white
and
brown
goats
for
they
knew
their
own
master
and
stall
peter
called
out
after
her
come
with
me
again
tomorrow
for
he
was
anxious
for
more
than
one
reason
that
heidi
should
go
with
him
the
next
day
o
grandfather
cried
heidi
it
was
so
beautiful
the
fire
and
the
roses
on
the
rocks
and
the
blue
and
yellow
flowers
and
look
what
i
have
brought
you
and
opening
the
apron
that
held
her
flowers
she
shook
them
all
out
at
her
grandfather
feet
but
the
poor
flowers
how
changed
they
were
heidi
hardly
knew
them
again
they
looked
like
dried
bits
of
hay
not
a
single
little
flower
cup
stood
open
o
grandfather
what
is
the
matter
with
them
exclaimed
heidi
in
shocked
surprise
they
were
not
like
that
this
morning
why
do
they
look
so
now
they
like
to
stand
out
there
in
the
sun
and
not
to
be
shut
up
in
an
apron
said
her
grandfather
then
i
will
never
gather
any
more
but
grandfather
why
did
the
great
bird
go
on
croaking
so
she
continued
in
an
eager
tone
of
inquiry
go
along
now
and
get
into
your
bath
while
i
go
and
get
some
milk
when
we
are
together
at
supper
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
heidi
obeyed
and
when
later
she
was
sitting
on
her
high
stool
before
her
milk
bowl
with
her
grandfather
beside
her
she
repeated
her
question
why
does
the
great
bird
go
on
croaking
and
screaming
down
at
us
grandfather
he
is
mocking
at
the
people
who
live
down
below
in
the
villages
because
they
all
go
huddling
and
gossipping
together
and
encourage
one
another
in
evil
talking
and
deeds
he
calls
out
you
would
separate
and
each
go
your
own
way
and
come
up
here
and
live
on
a
height
as
i
do
it
would
be
better
for
you
there
was
almost
a
wildness
in
the
old
man
voice
as
he
spoke
so
that
heidi
seemed
to
hear
the
croaking
of
the
bird
again
even
more
distinctly
why
have
the
mountains
any
names
heidi
went
on
they
have
names
answered
her
grandfather
and
if
you
can
describe
one
of
them
to
me
that
i
know
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
called
heidi
then
described
to
him
the
rocky
mountain
with
the
two
high
peaks
so
exactly
that
the
grandfather
was
delighted
just
so
i
know
it
and
he
told
her
its
name
then
heidi
told
him
of
the
mountain
with
the
great
snowfield
and
how
it
had
been
on
fire
the
grandfather
explained
to
her
it
was
the
sun
that
did
it
when
he
says
to
the
mountains
he
throws
his
most
beautiful
colors
over
them
so
that
they
may
not
forget
him
before
he
comes
again
the
next
day
heidi
was
delighted
with
this
explanation
and
could
hardly
bear
to
wait
for
another
day
to
come
that
she
might
once
more
climb
up
with
the
goats
and
see
how
the
sun
bid
to
the
mountains
but
she
had
to
go
to
bed
first
and
all
night
she
slept
soundly
on
her
bed
of
hay
dreaming
of
nothing
but
of
shining
mountains
with
red
roses
all
over
them
among
which
happy
little
snowflake
went
leaping
in
and
out
chapter
iv
shooting
down
the
mountain
side
the
next
morning
the
sun
came
out
early
as
bright
as
ever
and
then
peter
appeared
with
the
goats
and
again
the
two
children
climbed
up
together
to
the
high
meadows
and
so
it
went
on
day
after
day
till
heidi
passing
her
life
thus
among
the
grass
and
flowers
was
burnt
brown
with
the
sun
and
grew
so
strong
and
healthy
that
nothing
ever
ailed
her
she
was
happy
too
and
lived
from
day
to
day
as
free
and
lighthearted
as
the
little
birds
that
make
their
home
among
the
green
forest
trees
then
the
autumn
came
and
the
wind
blew
louder
and
stronger
and
the
grandfather
would
say
sometimes
today
you
must
stay
at
home
heidi
a
sudden
gust
of
the
wind
would
blow
a
little
thing
like
you
over
the
rocks
into
the
valley
below
in
a
moment
whenever
peter
heard
that
he
must
go
alone
he
looked
very
unhappy
for
he
saw
nothing
but
mishaps
of
all
kinds
ahead
and
did
not
know
how
he
should
bear
the
long
dull
day
without
heidi
then
too
there
was
the
good
meal
he
would
miss
and
besides
that
the
goats
on
these
days
were
so
naughty
and
obstinate
that
he
had
twice
the
usual
trouble
with
them
for
they
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
heidi
presence
that
they
would
run
in
every
direction
and
refuse
to
go
on
unless
she
was
with
them
heidi
was
never
unhappy
for
wherever
she
was
she
found
something
to
interest
or
amuse
her
she
liked
best
it
is
true
to
go
out
with
peter
up
to
the
flowers
and
the
great
bird
but
she
also
found
her
grandfather
hammering
and
sawing
and
carpentering
very
entertaining
and
if
it
should
chance
to
be
the
day
when
the
large
round
cheese
was
made
she
enjoyed
beyond
measure
watching
her
grandfather
stir
the
great
cauldron
the
thing
which
attracted
her
most
however
was
the
waving
and
roaring
of
the
three
old
fir
trees
on
these
windy
days
she
would
stand
underneath
them
and
look
up
unable
to
tear
herself
away
looking
and
listening
while
they
bowed
and
swayed
and
roared
as
the
mighty
wind
rushed
through
them
there
was
no
longer
now
the
warm
bright
sun
that
had
shone
all
through
the
summer
so
heidi
went
to
the
cupboard
and
got
out
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
dress
then
it
grew
very
cold
and
peter
would
come
up
early
in
the
morning
blowing
on
his
fingers
to
keep
them
warm
but
he
soon
left
off
coming
for
one
night
there
was
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
and
the
next
morning
the
whole
mountain
was
covered
with
it
and
not
a
single
little
green
leaf
even
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
upon
it
there
was
no
peter
that
day
and
heidi
stood
at
the
little
window
looking
out
in
wonderment
for
the
snow
was
beginning
again
and
the
thick
flakes
kept
falling
till
the
snow
was
up
to
the
window
and
still
they
continued
to
fall
and
the
snow
grew
higher
so
that
at
last
the
window
could
not
be
opened
and
she
and
her
grandfather
were
shut
up
fast
within
the
hut
heidi
thought
this
was
great
fun
and
ran
from
one
window
to
the
other
the
next
day
the
snow
having
ceased
the
grandfather
went
out
and
shoveled
it
away
from
the
house
and
threw
it
into
such
great
heaps
that
they
looked
like
mountains
heidi
and
her
grandfather
were
sitting
one
afternoon
on
their
stools
before
the
fire
when
there
came
a
great
thump
at
the
door
it
was
peter
all
white
with
snow
for
he
had
had
to
fight
his
way
through
deep
snowdrifts
he
had
been
determined
however
to
climb
up
to
the
hut
for
it
was
a
week
now
since
he
had
seen
heidi
he
said
as
he
came
in
then
he
went
and
placed
himself
as
near
the
fire
as
he
could
his
whole
face
beaming
with
pleasure
at
finding
himself
there
heidi
looked
on
in
astonishment
for
peter
was
beginning
to
thaw
all
over
with
the
warmth
so
that
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
trickling
waterfall
well
general
how
goes
it
with
you
said
the
grandfather
now
that
you
have
lost
your
army
you
will
have
to
turn
to
your
pen
and
pencil
why
must
he
turn
to
his
pen
and
pencil
asked
heidi
immediately
full
of
curiosity
during
the
winter
he
must
go
to
school
explained
her
grandfather
and
learn
how
to
read
and
write
it
a
bit
hard
although
useful
sometimes
afterwards
am
i
not
right
general
yes
indeed
assented
peter
heidi
interest
was
now
thoroughly
awakened
and
she
had
so
many
questions
to
ask
peter
about
school
and
the
conversation
took
so
long
that
he
had
time
to
get
thoroughly
dry
well
now
general
you
have
been
under
fire
for
some
time
and
must
want
some
refreshment
come
and
join
us
said
the
grandfather
as
he
brought
the
supper
out
of
the
cupboard
and
heidi
pushed
the
stools
to
the
table
there
was
also
now
a
bench
fastened
against
the
wall
for
as
he
was
no
longer
alone
the
grandfather
had
put
up
seats
of
various
kinds
here
and
there
long
enough
to
hold
two
persons
for
heidi
had
a
way
of
always
keeping
close
to
her
grandfather
whether
he
was
walking
sitting
or
standing
peter
opened
his
round
eyes
very
wide
when
he
saw
what
a
large
piece
of
meat
gave
him
on
his
thick
slice
of
bread
it
was
a
long
time
since
peter
had
had
anything
so
nice
to
eat
as
soon
as
the
pleasant
meal
was
over
he
began
to
get
ready
for
returning
home
for
it
was
already
growing
dark
he
had
said
his
and
his
thanks
and
was
just
going
out
when
he
turned
and
said
i
shall
come
again
next
sunday
this
day
week
and
my
grandmother
sent
word
that
she
would
like
you
to
come
and
see
her
some
day
it
was
quite
a
new
idea
to
heidi
that
she
should
go
and
pay
anybody
a
visit
and
she
could
not
get
it
out
of
her
head
so
the
first
thing
she
said
to
her
grandfather
the
next
day
was
i
must
go
down
to
see
the
grandmother
today
she
will
be
expecting
me
the
snow
is
too
deep
answered
the
grandfather
trying
to
put
her
off
not
a
day
passed
but
what
she
said
five
or
six
times
to
her
grandfather
i
must
certainly
go
today
the
grandmother
will
be
waiting
for
me
on
the
fourth
day
when
heidi
was
sitting
on
her
high
stool
at
dinner
with
the
bright
sun
shining
in
upon
her
through
the
window
she
again
repeated
her
little
speech
i
must
certainly
go
down
to
see
the
grandmother
today
or
else
i
shall
keep
her
waiting
too
long
the
grandfather
rose
from
the
table
climbed
up
to
the
hayloft
and
brought
down
the
thick
sack
that
was
heidi
coverlid
and
said
come
along
then
the
child
skipped
out
gleefully
after
him
into
the
glittering
world
of
snow
the
old
fir
trees
were
standing
now
quite
silent
their
branches
covered
with
the
white
snow
and
they
looked
so
lovely
as
they
glittered
and
sparkled
in
the
sunlight
that
heidi
jumped
for
joy
at
the
sight
and
kept
on
calling
out
come
here
come
here
grandfather
the
fir
trees
are
all
silver
and
gold
the
grandfather
had
gone
into
the
shed
and
he
now
came
out
dragging
a
large
inside
there
was
a
low
seat
and
the
sleigh
could
be
pushed
forward
and
guided
by
the
feet
of
the
one
who
sat
upon
it
with
the
help
of
a
pole
that
was
fastened
to
the
side
the
old
man
got
in
and
lifted
the
child
on
to
his
lap
then
he
wrapped
her
up
in
the
sack
that
she
might
keep
nice
and
warm
and
put
his
left
arm
closely
round
her
for
it
was
necessary
to
hold
her
tight
during
the
coming
journey
he
now
grasped
the
pole
with
his
right
hand
and
gave
the
sleigh
a
push
forward
with
his
two
feet
it
shot
down
the
mountain
side
with
such
rapidity
that
heidi
thought
they
were
flying
through
the
air
like
a
bird
and
shouted
aloud
with
delight
suddenly
they
came
to
a
standstill
and
there
they
were
at
peter
hut
her
grandfather
lifted
her
out
and
unwrapped
her
there
you
are
now
go
in
and
when
it
begins
to
grow
dark
you
must
start
on
your
way
home
again
then
he
left
her
and
went
up
the
mountain
pulling
his
sleigh
after
him
heidi
opened
the
door
of
the
hut
and
stepped
into
a
tiny
room
that
looked
very
dark
with
a
fireplace
and
a
few
dishes
on
a
wooden
shelf
this
was
the
little
kitchen
she
opened
another
door
and
found
herself
in
another
small
room
for
the
place
was
not
a
herdsman
hut
like
her
grandfather
with
one
large
room
on
the
ground
floor
and
a
above
but
a
very
old
cottage
where
everything
was
narrow
and
poor
and
shabby
a
table
was
close
to
the
door
and
as
heidi
stepped
in
she
saw
a
woman
sitting
at
it
putting
a
patch
on
a
waistcoat
which
heidi
recognized
at
once
as
peter
in
the
corner
sat
an
old
woman
bent
with
age
spinning
heidi
was
quite
sure
this
was
the
grandmother
so
she
went
up
to
the
and
said
grandmother
i
have
come
at
last
did
you
think
i
was
a
long
time
coming
the
old
woman
raised
her
head
and
felt
for
the
hand
that
the
child
held
out
to
her
and
when
she
had
found
it
she
passed
her
own
over
it
thoughtfully
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
said
are
you
the
child
who
lives
up
with
are
you
heidi
yes
yes
answered
heidi
i
have
just
come
down
in
the
sleigh
with
grandfather
is
it
possible
why
your
hands
are
quite
warm
brigitta
did
come
himself
with
the
child
peter
mother
had
left
her
work
and
risen
from
the
table
and
now
stood
looking
at
heidi
with
curiosity
scanning
her
from
head
to
foot
i
do
not
know
mother
whether
uncle
came
himself
it
is
hardly
likely
the
child
probably
makes
a
mistake
but
heidi
looked
steadily
at
the
woman
and
said
i
know
quite
well
who
wrapped
me
up
in
my
bedcover
and
brought
me
down
in
the
sleigh
it
was
grandfather
there
was
some
truth
then
perhaps
in
what
peter
used
to
tell
us
of
during
the
summer
when
we
thought
he
must
be
wrong
said
grandmother
but
who
would
ever
have
believed
that
such
a
thing
was
possible
i
did
not
think
the
child
would
live
three
weeks
up
there
what
is
she
like
brigitta
the
latter
had
so
thoroughly
examined
heidi
on
all
sides
that
she
was
well
able
to
describe
her
to
her
mother
heidi
meanwhile
had
not
been
idle
she
had
made
the
round
of
the
room
and
looked
carefully
at
everything
there
was
to
be
seen
all
of
a
sudden
she
exclaimed
grandmother
one
of
your
shutters
is
flapping
backwards
and
forwards
grandfather
would
put
a
nail
in
and
make
it
all
right
in
a
minute
it
will
break
one
of
the
panes
some
day
look
how
it
keeps
on
banging
ah
dear
child
said
the
old
woman
i
am
not
able
to
see
it
but
i
can
hear
that
and
many
other
things
besides
the
shutter
everything
about
the
place
rattles
and
creaks
when
the
wind
is
blowing
and
it
gets
inside
through
all
the
cracks
and
holes
the
house
is
going
to
pieces
and
in
the
night
when
the
two
others
are
asleep
i
often
lie
awake
in
fear
and
trembling
thinking
that
the
whole
place
will
give
way
and
fall
and
kill
us
and
there
is
not
a
creature
to
mend
anything
for
us
for
peter
does
not
understand
such
work
but
why
can
not
you
see
grandmother
that
the
shutter
is
loose
look
there
it
goes
again
see
that
one
there
and
heidi
pointed
to
the
particular
shutter
alas
child
i
can
see
nothing
nothing
said
the
grandmother
in
a
voice
of
lamentation
but
if
i
were
to
go
outside
and
put
back
the
shutter
so
that
you
had
more
light
then
you
could
see
grandmother
no
no
not
even
then
no
one
can
make
it
light
for
me
again
but
if
you
were
to
go
outside
among
all
the
white
snow
then
surely
you
would
find
it
light
just
come
with
me
grandmother
and
i
will
show
you
heidi
took
hold
of
the
old
woman
hand
to
lead
her
along
for
she
was
beginning
to
feel
quite
distressed
at
the
thought
of
her
being
without
light
let
me
be
dear
child
it
is
always
dark
for
me
now
whether
in
snow
or
sun
it
will
never
be
light
for
me
again
on
earth
never
at
these
words
heidi
broke
into
loud
crying
in
her
distress
she
kept
on
sobbing
out
who
can
make
it
light
for
you
again
can
no
one
do
it
is
there
any
one
who
can
do
it
the
grandmother
now
tried
to
comfort
the
child
but
it
was
not
easy
to
quiet
her
heidi
did
not
often
weep
but
when
she
did
she
could
not
get
over
her
trouble
for
a
long
while
at
last
the
old
woman
said
dear
heidi
you
can
not
think
how
glad
i
am
to
hear
a
kind
word
when
i
can
no
longer
see
and
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
me
to
listen
to
you
while
you
talk
so
come
and
sit
beside
me
and
tell
me
what
you
do
up
there
and
how
grandfather
occupies
himself
i
knew
him
very
well
in
the
old
days
but
for
many
years
now
i
have
heard
nothing
of
him
except
through
peter
who
never
says
much
this
was
a
new
and
happy
idea
to
heidi
she
quickly
dried
her
tears
and
said
in
a
comforting
voice
wait
grandmother
till
i
have
told
grandfather
everything
he
will
make
it
light
for
you
again
i
am
sure
and
will
do
something
so
that
the
house
will
not
fall
he
will
put
everything
right
for
you
heidi
now
began
to
give
a
lively
description
of
her
life
with
the
grandfather
and
of
the
days
she
spent
on
the
mountain
with
the
goats
and
then
went
on
to
tell
what
she
did
during
the
winter
and
how
her
grandfather
was
able
to
make
all
sorts
of
things
seats
and
stools
and
mangers
where
the
hay
was
put
for
little
swan
and
little
bear
besides
a
new
large
for
her
to
bathe
in
when
the
summer
came
and
a
new
and
spoon
the
grandmother
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
only
from
time
to
time
addressing
her
daughter
do
you
hear
that
brigitta
do
you
hear
what
she
is
saying
about
uncle
the
conversation
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
heavy
thump
on
the
door
and
in
marched
peter
who
stood
opening
his
eyes
with
astonishment
when
he
caught
sight
of
heidi
then
his
face
beamed
with
smiles
as
she
called
out
peter
what
is
the
boy
back
from
school
already
exclaimed
the
grandmother
in
surprise
i
have
not
known
an
afternoon
to
pass
so
quickly
as
this
one
for
years
how
is
the
reading
getting
on
peter
as
usual
was
peter
answer
the
old
woman
gave
a
little
sigh
ah
well
she
said
i
hoped
you
would
have
something
different
to
tell
me
by
this
time
as
you
are
going
to
be
twelve
years
old
this
february
what
was
it
you
hoped
he
would
have
to
tell
you
asked
heidi
interested
in
all
the
grandmother
said
i
mean
that
he
ought
to
have
learnt
to
read
a
bit
by
now
continued
the
grandmother
up
there
on
the
shelf
is
an
old
with
beautiful
songs
in
it
which
i
have
not
heard
for
a
long
time
and
can
not
now
remember
to
repeat
to
myself
and
i
hoped
that
peter
would
soon
learn
enough
to
be
able
to
read
one
of
them
to
me
sometimes
but
he
finds
it
too
difficult
heidi
now
jumped
up
from
her
low
chair
and
holding
out
her
hand
hastily
to
the
grandmother
said
grandmother
it
is
getting
dark
i
must
go
home
at
once
and
bidding
to
peter
and
his
mother
she
went
towards
the
door
but
the
grandmother
called
out
in
an
anxious
voice
wait
wait
heidi
you
must
not
go
alone
like
that
peter
must
go
with
you
have
you
got
something
warm
to
put
round
your
throat
i
have
not
anything
to
put
on
called
back
heidi
but
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
be
cold
and
with
that
she
ran
outside
and
went
off
at
such
a
pace
that
peter
had
difficulty
in
overtaking
her
the
children
had
taken
but
a
few
steps
before
they
saw
the
grandfather
coming
down
to
meet
them
and
in
another
minute
his
long
strides
had
brought
him
to
their
side
that
right
heidi
you
have
kept
your
word
said
the
grandfather
and
then
wrapping
the
sack
firmly
round
her
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
strode
off
with
her
up
the
mountain
they
had
no
sooner
got
inside
the
hut
than
heidi
at
once
began
grandfather
tomorrow
we
must
take
the
hammer
and
the
long
nails
and
fasten
grandmother
shutter
and
drive
in
a
lot
more
nails
in
other
places
for
her
house
shakes
and
rattles
all
over
illustration
heidi
now
began
to
give
a
lively
description
of
her
life
with
the
grandfather
we
must
must
we
who
told
you
that
asked
her
grandfather
nobody
told
me
but
i
know
it
for
all
that
replied
heidi
for
everything
is
giving
way
and
when
the
grandmother
can
not
sleep
she
lies
trembling
for
she
thinks
that
every
minute
the
house
will
fall
down
on
their
heads
and
everything
now
is
dark
for
grandmother
and
she
does
not
think
any
one
can
make
it
light
for
her
again
but
you
will
be
able
to
i
am
sure
grandfather
tomorrow
we
must
go
and
help
her
we
will
wo
we
grandfather
the
child
was
clinging
to
the
old
man
and
looking
up
at
him
in
trustful
confidence
the
grandfather
looked
down
at
heidi
for
a
while
without
speaking
and
then
said
yes
heidi
we
will
do
something
to
stop
the
rattling
at
least
we
can
do
that
we
will
go
down
about
it
tomorrow
the
child
went
skipping
round
the
room
for
joy
crying
out
we
shall
go
tomorrow
we
shall
go
tomorrow
the
grandfather
kept
his
promise
on
the
following
afternoon
he
brought
the
sleigh
out
again
and
as
on
the
previous
day
he
set
heidi
down
at
the
door
of
the
grandmother
hut
and
said
go
in
now
and
when
it
grows
dark
come
out
again
then
he
put
the
sack
in
the
sleigh
and
went
round
the
house
heidi
had
hardly
opened
the
door
and
sprung
into
the
room
when
the
grandmother
called
out
from
her
corner
it
the
child
again
here
she
comes
heidi
ran
to
her
and
then
quickly
drew
the
little
stool
close
up
to
the
old
woman
and
seating
herself
upon
it
began
to
tell
and
ask
her
all
kinds
of
things
all
at
once
came
the
sound
of
heavy
blows
against
the
wall
of
the
hut
and
grandmother
gave
such
a
start
of
alarm
that
she
nearly
upset
the
and
cried
in
a
trembling
voice
ah
my
god
now
it
is
coming
the
house
is
going
to
fall
upon
us
but
heidi
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
said
soothingly
no
no
grandmother
do
not
be
frightened
it
is
only
grandfather
with
his
hammer
he
is
mending
up
everything
so
that
you
sha
have
such
fear
and
trouble
is
it
possible
is
it
really
possible
so
the
dear
god
has
not
forgotten
us
exclaimed
the
grandmother
do
you
hear
brigitta
what
that
noise
is
did
you
hear
what
the
child
says
go
outside
brigitta
and
if
it
is
tell
him
he
must
come
inside
a
moment
that
i
may
thank
him
brigitta
went
outside
and
found
in
the
act
of
fastening
some
heavy
pieces
of
new
wood
along
the
wall
she
stepped
up
to
him
and
said
uncle
mother
and
i
thank
you
for
doing
us
such
a
kind
service
and
she
would
like
to
tell
you
herself
how
grateful
she
is
i
do
not
know
who
else
would
have
done
it
for
us
we
shall
not
forget
your
kindness
for
i
am
sure
that
will
do
said
the
old
man
interrupting
her
i
know
what
you
think
of
without
your
telling
me
go
indoors
again
i
can
find
out
for
myself
where
the
mending
is
wanted
brigitta
obeyed
on
the
spot
for
uncle
had
a
way
with
him
that
made
few
people
care
to
oppose
his
will
he
went
on
knocking
with
his
hammer
all
round
the
house
and
then
mounted
the
narrow
steps
to
the
roof
and
hammered
away
there
until
he
had
used
up
all
the
nails
he
had
brought
with
him
meanwhile
it
had
been
growing
dark
and
he
had
hardly
come
down
from
the
roof
and
dragged
the
sleigh
out
from
behind
the
when
heidi
appeared
outside
the
grandfather
wrapped
her
up
and
took
her
in
his
arms
as
he
had
done
the
day
before
for
although
he
had
to
drag
the
sleigh
up
the
mountain
after
him
he
feared
that
if
the
child
sat
in
it
alone
her
wrappings
would
fall
off
and
that
she
would
be
nearly
if
not
quite
frozen
so
he
carried
her
warm
and
safe
in
his
arms
so
the
winter
went
by
after
many
years
of
joyless
life
the
blind
grandmother
had
at
last
found
something
to
make
her
happy
she
listened
for
the
little
tripping
footstep
as
soon
as
day
had
come
and
when
she
heard
the
door
open
and
knew
the
child
was
really
there
she
would
call
out
god
be
thanked
she
has
come
again
and
heidi
had
also
grown
very
fond
of
the
old
grandmother
and
when
at
last
she
knew
for
certain
that
no
one
could
make
it
light
for
her
again
she
was
overcome
with
sorrow
but
the
grandmother
told
her
again
that
she
felt
the
darkness
much
less
when
heidi
was
with
her
and
so
every
fine
winter
day
the
child
came
traveling
down
in
her
sleigh
the
grandfather
always
took
her
never
raising
any
objection
indeed
he
always
carried
the
hammer
and
sundry
other
things
down
in
the
sleigh
with
him
and
many
an
afternoon
was
spent
by
him
in
making
the
goatherd
cottage
sound
and
tight
it
no
longer
groaned
and
rattled
the
whole
night
through
and
the
grandmother
who
for
many
winters
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
in
peace
as
she
did
now
said
she
should
never
forget
what
the
uncle
had
done
for
her
chapter
v
a
railroad
journey
heidi
was
now
in
her
eighth
year
she
had
learnt
all
kinds
of
useful
things
from
her
grandfather
she
knew
how
to
look
after
the
goats
as
well
as
any
one
and
little
swan
and
little
bear
would
follow
her
like
two
faithful
dogs
and
give
a
loud
bleat
of
pleasure
when
they
heard
her
voice
twice
during
the
course
of
this
last
winter
peter
had
brought
up
a
message
from
the
schoolmaster
at
doerfli
who
sent
word
to
that
he
ought
to
send
heidi
to
school
as
she
was
over
the
usual
age
and
ought
indeed
to
have
gone
the
winter
before
uncle
had
sent
word
back
each
time
that
the
schoolmaster
would
find
him
at
home
if
he
had
anything
he
wished
to
say
to
him
but
that
he
did
not
intend
to
send
heidi
to
school
as
heidi
was
running
about
one
sunny
march
morning
and
had
just
jumped
over
the
for
the
tenth
time
at
least
she
nearly
fell
backwards
into
it
with
fright
for
there
in
front
of
her
stood
an
old
gentleman
dressed
in
black
when
he
saw
how
startled
she
was
he
said
in
a
kind
voice
do
be
afraid
of
me
for
i
am
very
fond
of
children
shake
hands
you
must
be
the
heidi
i
have
heard
of
where
is
your
grandfather
he
is
sitting
by
the
table
making
round
wooden
spoons
heidi
informed
him
as
she
opened
the
door
it
was
the
old
village
pastor
from
doerfli
who
had
been
a
neighbor
of
uncle
when
he
lived
down
there
he
stepped
inside
the
hut
and
going
up
to
the
old
man
who
was
bending
over
his
work
said
neighbor
the
grandfather
looked
up
in
surprise
and
then
rising
said
in
return
he
pushed
his
chair
towards
the
visitor
as
he
continued
if
you
do
not
mind
a
wooden
seat
there
is
one
for
you
the
pastor
sat
down
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
seen
you
neighbor
he
said
i
think
you
know
already
what
it
is
that
has
brought
me
here
and
as
he
spoke
he
looked
towards
the
child
who
was
standing
at
the
door
heidi
go
off
to
the
goats
said
her
grandfather
you
can
take
them
a
little
salt
and
stay
with
them
till
i
come
heidi
vanished
on
the
spot
the
child
ought
to
have
been
at
school
a
year
ago
and
most
certainly
this
last
winter
said
the
pastor
the
schoolmaster
sent
you
word
about
it
but
you
gave
him
no
answer
what
are
you
thinking
of
doing
with
the
child
neighbor
i
am
thinking
of
not
sending
her
to
school
was
the
answer
how
are
you
going
to
let
her
grow
up
then
i
am
going
to
let
her
grow
up
and
be
happy
among
the
goats
and
birds
with
them
she
is
safe
and
will
learn
nothing
evil
but
the
child
is
not
a
goat
or
a
bird
she
is
a
human
being
it
is
time
she
began
her
lessons
this
is
the
last
winter
she
must
be
allowed
to
run
wild
next
winter
she
must
come
regularly
to
school
every
day
she
will
do
no
such
thing
said
the
old
man
with
calm
determination
do
you
mean
that
you
intend
to
stick
obstinately
to
your
decision
said
the
pastor
growing
somewhat
angry
you
have
been
about
the
world
and
i
should
have
given
you
credit
for
more
sense
neighbor
indeed
replied
the
old
man
could
you
expect
me
to
send
a
young
child
down
the
mountain
on
mornings
through
storm
and
snow
and
let
her
return
at
night
when
the
wind
is
raging
have
you
forgotten
the
child
mother
adelaide
she
was
a
and
had
fits
might
not
the
child
be
attacked
in
the
same
way
if
obliged
to
herself
and
you
think
you
can
come
and
force
me
to
send
her
i
will
go
before
all
the
courts
of
justice
in
the
country
and
then
we
shall
see
who
will
force
me
to
do
it
perhaps
you
are
right
neighbor
said
the
pastor
in
a
friendly
tone
of
voice
if
it
is
impossible
to
send
the
child
to
school
from
here
come
down
into
doerfli
and
live
again
among
your
what
sort
of
a
life
is
this
you
lead
alone
and
with
bitter
thoughts
towards
god
and
man
no
pastor
as
to
going
down
to
doerfli
to
live
that
is
far
from
my
thoughts
the
people
despise
me
and
i
them
it
is
therefore
best
for
all
of
us
that
we
live
apart
the
visitor
had
risen
and
stood
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
old
man
as
he
added
with
renewed
earnestness
i
will
wager
that
next
winter
you
will
be
down
among
us
again
and
we
shall
be
good
neighbors
as
of
old
promise
me
that
you
will
come
and
live
with
us
again
and
become
reconciled
to
god
and
man
gave
the
pastor
his
hand
and
answered
him
calmly
and
firmly
you
mean
well
by
me
i
know
but
i
will
not
send
the
child
to
school
nor
come
and
live
among
you
then
god
help
you
said
the
pastor
as
he
left
the
hut
and
went
down
the
mountain
was
out
of
humor
when
heidi
said
as
usual
that
afternoon
can
we
go
down
to
grandmother
now
he
answered
not
today
he
did
not
speak
again
the
whole
day
and
the
following
morning
when
heidi
again
asked
the
same
question
he
replied
we
will
see
but
before
the
dinner
bowls
bad
been
cleared
away
another
visitor
arrived
and
this
time
it
was
dete
she
wore
a
fine
feathered
hat
and
a
long
trailing
dress
which
swept
the
floor
the
grandfather
looked
her
up
and
down
without
uttering
a
word
but
dete
was
prepared
with
an
exceedingly
amiable
speech
and
began
at
once
to
praise
the
looks
of
the
child
she
should
hardly
have
known
her
again
and
it
was
evident
that
heidi
had
been
happy
and
with
her
grandfather
but
she
had
just
heard
of
something
that
would
be
a
lucky
chance
for
her
some
wealthy
people
in
frankfurt
wanted
a
companion
for
their
only
daughter
who
was
an
invalid
heidi
was
just
the
sort
of
child
they
were
looking
for
and
unspoiled
and
after
dete
had
given
them
a
description
of
heidi
they
had
agreed
to
take
her
and
no
one
could
tell
what
good
fortune
there
might
not
be
in
store
for
her
for
if
these
rich
people
should
take
a
fancy
to
heidi
have
you
nearly
finished
what
you
had
to
say
broke
in
who
had
allowed
her
to
talk
on
uninterruptedly
so
far
ugh
exclaimed
dete
throwing
up
her
head
in
disgust
one
would
think
i
had
been
talking
to
you
about
the
most
ordinary
matter
why
there
is
not
one
person
in
all
praettigau
who
would
not
thank
god
if
i
were
to
bring
them
such
a
piece
of
news
as
i
am
bringing
you
you
may
take
your
news
to
anybody
you
like
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
dete
leaped
up
from
her
seat
like
a
rocket
and
cried
if
that
is
all
you
have
to
say
about
it
why
then
i
will
give
you
a
bit
of
my
mind
the
child
is
now
eight
years
old
and
knows
nothing
and
you
will
not
let
her
learn
you
will
not
send
her
to
church
or
school
as
i
was
told
down
in
doerfli
and
she
is
my
own
sister
child
i
am
responsible
for
what
happens
to
her
and
this
is
a
good
opening
for
her
i
have
everybody
in
doerfli
on
my
side
there
is
not
one
person
there
who
will
not
take
my
part
against
you
and
i
advise
you
to
think
well
before
bringing
it
into
court
if
that
is
your
intention
there
are
certain
things
which
might
be
brought
up
against
you
that
you
would
not
care
to
hear
for
when
one
has
to
do
with
lawcourts
there
is
a
great
deal
raked
up
that
had
been
forgotten

silent
thundered
the
uncle
and
his
eyes
flashed
with
anger

and
be
done
with
you
and
never
let
me
see
you
again
with
your
hat
and
feather
and
with
that
he
strode
out
of
the
hut
you
have
made
grandfather
angry
said
heidi
and
her
dark
eyes
had
anything
but
a
friendly
expression
in
them
as
she
looked
at
dete
he
will
soon
be
all
right
again

dete
hurriedly
and

heidi

have
all
sorts
of
good
things

she
went
to
the
cupboard
and
taking
out
things
rolled
them
up
in
a
bundle
come
along
now
there
your
hat

shabby
but

repeated
heidi

stupid
and
obstinate
like
a
goat
i
suppose
it
from
the
goats
you
have
learnt
to
be
so
listen
to
me
you
saw
your
grandfather
was
angry
and
heard
what
he
said
that
he
did
not
wish
to
ever
see
us
again
he
wants
you
to
go
away
with
me
and
you
must
not
make
him
angrier
still
you
ca
think
how
nice
it
is
at
frankfurt
and
if
you
do
not
like
it
you
can
come
back
again
your
grandfather
will
be
in
a
good
humor
by
that
time
can
i
return
at
once
and
be
back
home
again
here
this
evening
asked
heidi
what
are
you
talking
about
come
along
now
i
tell
you
that
you
can
come
back
here
when
you
like
today
we
shall
go
as
far
as
mayenfeld
and
early
tomorrow
we
shall
start
in
the
train
it
will
bring
you
home
again
in
no
time
when
you
wish
it
for
it
goes
as
fast
as
the
wind
they
started
down
the
mountain
and
as
they
neared
the
grandmother
hut
they
met
peter
coming
round
the
corner
carrying
an
immense
bundle
of
long
thick
hazel
sticks
on
his
shoulders
he
stood
still
and
stared
at
the
two
approaching
figures
as
they
came
up
to
him
he
exclaimed
where
are
you
going
heidi
i
am
only
just
going
over
to
frankfurt
for
a
little
visit
with
dete
she
replied
but
i
must
first
run
in
to
grandmother
she
will
be
expecting
me
no
no
you
must
not
stop
to
talk
it
is
already
too
late
said
dete
holding
heidi
who
was
struggling
to
get
away
you
can
go
in
when
you
come
back
and
she
pulled
the
child
on
with
her
peter
ran
into
the
hut
and
banged
against
the
table
with
his
bundle
of
sticks
with
such
violence
that
everything
in
the
room
shook
and
his
grandmother
leaped
up
with
a
cry
of
alarm
from
her
what
is
the
matter
what
is
the
matter
cried
the
frightened
old
woman
she
is
taking
heidi
away
explained
peter
who
who
where
to
peter
where
to
asked
the
grandmother
growing
still
more
agitated
but
even
as
she
spoke
she
guessed
what
had
happened
for
brigitta
had
told
her
shortly
before
that
she
had
seen
dete
going
up
to
the
old
woman
opened
the
window
and
called
out
beseechingly
dete
dete
do
not
take
the
child
away
from
us
do
not
take
her
away
the
two
who
were
hastening
down
the
mountain
heard
her
voice
and
dete
evidently
caught
the
words
for
she
grasped
heidi
hand
more
firmly
heidi
struggled
to
get
free
crying
grandmother
is
calling
i
must
go
to
her
but
dete
had
no
intention
of
letting
the
child
go
and
quieted
her
as
best
she
could
by
promising
that
she
could
take
something
nice
back
to
grandmother
this
was
a
new
idea
to
heidi
and
it
pleased
her
so
much
that
dete
had
no
longer
any
difficulty
in
getting
her
along
what
could
i
take
back
to
her
heidi
asked
a
soft
roll
of
white
bread
she
would
enjoy
that
for
now
she
is
old
she
can
hardly
eat
the
hard
black
bread
answered
dete
yes
she
always
gives
it
back
to
peter
telling
him
it
is
too
hard
affirmed
heidi
do
let
us
make
haste
for
then
perhaps
we
can
get
back
soon
from
frankfurt
and
i
shall
be
able
to
give
her
the
white
bread
today
and
heidi
started
off
running
so
fast
that
dete
with
the
bundle
under
her
arm
could
scarcely
keep
up
with
her
from
that
day
forward
looked
fiercer
and
more
forbidding
than
ever
when
he
came
down
and
passed
through
doerfli
he
spoke
to
no
one
and
looked
such
an
ogre
as
he
came
along
with
his
pack
of
cheeses
on
his
back
his
immense
stick
in
his
hand
and
his
thick
frowning
eyebrows
that
the
women
would
call
to
their
little
ones
take
care
get
out
of
way
or
he
may
hurt
you
the
old
man
took
no
notice
of
anybody
as
he
strode
through
the
village
on
his
way
to
the
valley
below
where
he
sold
his
cheeses
and
bought
what
bread
and
meat
he
wanted
for
himself
after
he
had
passed
the
villagers
all
crowded
together
looking
after
him
they
agreed
that
it
was
a
great
mercy
the
child
had
got
away
from
him
only
the
blind
grandmother
would
have
nothing
to
say
against
him
and
told
those
who
came
to
bring
her
work
how
kind
and
thoughtful
he
had
been
with
the
child
how
good
to
her
and
her
daughter
and
how
many
afternoons
he
had
spent
mending
the
house
all
this
was
repeated
down
in
doerfli
but
most
of
the
people
who
heard
it
said
that
grandmother
was
too
old
to
understand
and
very
likely
had
not
heard
rightly
what
was
said
as
she
was
blind
probably
she
was
also
deaf

chapter
vi
clara
the
patient
little
invalid
in
her
home
at
frankfurt
clara
the
little
daughter
of
sesemann
was
lying
on
the
invalid
couch
on
which
she
spent
her
whole
day
being
wheeled
in
it
from
room
to
room
her
little
face
was
thin
and
pale
and
at
this
moment
her
two
soft
blue
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
clock
which
seemed
to
her
to
go
very
slowly
this
day
and
with
a
slight
accent
of
impatience
which
was
very
rare
with
her
she
asked
is
it
time
yet
miss
rottermeyer
this
lady
was
sitting
very
upright
at
a
small
busy
with
her
embroidery
she
wore
a
head
piece
which
made
her
look
very
solemn
and
dignified
for
many
years
past
since
clara
mother
had
died
the
housekeeping
and
the
superintendence
of
the
servants
had
been
entrusted
to
miss
rottermeyer
the
father
who
was
often
away
from
home
left
her
in
sole
charge
with
the
condition
only
that
his
little
daughter
should
have
a
voice
in
all
matters
and
that
nothing
should
be
done
against
her
wish
as
clara
was
putting
her
impatient
question
for
the
second
time
dete
and
heidi
arrived
at
the
front
door
tinette
the
maid
in
dainty
cap
and
apron
ushered
them
upstairs
into
the
library
dete
remained
standing
politely
near
the
door
still
holding
heidi
tightly
by
the
hand
for
she
did
not
know
what
the
child
might
take
it
into
her
head
to
do
amid
these
new
surroundings
miss
rottermeyer
rose
slowly
and
went
up
to
the
little
new
companion
for
the
daughter
of
the
house
to
see
what
she
was
like
she
did
not
seem
very
pleased
with
her
appearance
heidi
was
dressed
in
her
plain
little
woolen
frock
and
her
hat
was
an
old
straw
one
bent
out
of
shape
the
child
looked
innocently
out
from
beneath
it
gazing
with
unconcealed
astonishment
at
the
lady
towering
head
dress
illustration
what
is
your
name
asked
miss
rottermeyer
after
examining
the
child
for
some
minutes
while
heidi
in
return
kept
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
upon
the
lady
heidi
she
answered
in
a
clear
ringing
voice
what
what
that
no
christian
name
for
a
child
you
were
not
christened
that
what
name
did
they
give
you
when
you
were
baptized
continued
miss
rottermeyer
i
do
not
remember
replied
heidi
what
a
way
to
answer
said
the
lady
shaking
her
head
dete
is
the
child
a
simpleton
or
only
saucy
if
the
lady
will
allow
me
i
will
speak
for
the
child
for
she
is
very
unaccustomed
to
strangers
said
dete
who
had
given
heidi
a
silent
poke
for
making
such
an
unsuitable
answer
she
is
certainly
not
stupid
nor
yet
saucy
she
speaks
exactly
as
she
thinks
this
is
the
first
time
she
has
ever
been
in
a
gentleman
house
and
she
does
not
know
good
manners
but
she
is
very
willing
to
learn
she
was
christened
adelaide
after
her
mother
my
sister
who
is
now
dead
well
that
a
name
that
one
can
pronounce
remarked
miss
rottermeyer
but
i
must
tell
you
dete
that
i
am
astonished
to
see
so
young
a
child
i
told
you
that
i
wanted
a
companion
of
the
same
age
as
the
young
lady
of
the
house
one
who
could
share
her
lessons
and
all
her
other
occupations
miss
clara
is
now
over
twelve
what
age
is
this
child
if
the
lady
will
allow
me
began
dete
again
in
her
usual
fluent
manner
i
myself
had
lost
count
of
her
exact
age
she
is
certainly
a
little
younger
but
not
much
i
can
not
say
precisely
but
i
think
she
is
ten
or
thereabouts
grandfather
told
me
i
was
eight
put
in
heidi
dete
gave
her
another
poke
but
as
the
child
had
not
the
least
idea
why
she
did
so
she
was
not
at
all
confused
what
only
eight
cried
miss
rottermeyer
angrily
four
years
too
young
of
what
use
is
such
a
child
and
what
have
you
learnt
what
books
did
you
have
to
learn
from
none
said
heidi
how
what
how
then
did
you
learn
to
read
continued
the
lady
i
have
never
learnt
to
read
or
peter
either
heidi
informed
her
mercy
upon
us
you
do
not
know
how
to
read
is
it
really
so
exclaimed
miss
rottermeyer
greatly
horrified
is
it
possible
not
able
to
read
what
have
you
learnt
then
nothing
said
heidi
with
unflinching
truthfulness
young
woman
said
the
lady
to
dete
this
is
not
at
all
the
sort
of
companion
we
want
how
could
you
think
of
bringing
me
a
child
like
this
but
dete
was
not
to
be
put
down
so
easily
and
answered
warmly
if
you
will
allow
me
the
child
is
exactly
what
i
thought
you
required
she
is
unlike
all
other
children
and
i
thought
this
child
seemed
as
if
made
for
the
place
but
i
must
go
now
for
my
mistress
will
be
waiting
for
me
if
you
will
permit
i
will
come
again
soon
and
see
how
she
is
getting
on
and
with
a
bow
dete
quickly
left
the
room
and
ran
downstairs
miss
rottermeyer
stood
for
a
moment
taken
aback
and
then
ran
after
dete
but
she
had
disappeared
out
the
front
door
heidi
remained
where
she
had
been
standing
since
she
first
came
in
clara
had
looked
on
during
the
interview
without
speaking
now
she
beckoned
to
heidi
and
said
come
here
heidi
went
up
to
her
would
you
rather
be
called
heidi
or
adelaide
asked
clara
i
am
never
called
anything
but
heidi
was
the
child
prompt
answer
then
i
shall
always
call
you
by
that
name
said
clara
it
suits
you
i
have
never
heard
it
before
but
neither
have
i
ever
seen
a
child
like
you
before
have
you
always
had
that
short
curly
hair
yes
i
think
so
said
heidi
are
you
pleased
to
come
to
frankfurt
went
on
clara
no
but
i
shall
go
home
again
tomorrow
and
take
grandmother
a
white
loaf
explained
heidi
well
you
are
a
funny
child
exclaimed
clara
do
you
know
you
were
sent
for
to
come
here
and
stay
with
me
and
share
my
lessons
they
are
dreadfully
dull
and
i
think
the
morning
will
never
pass
away
my
tutor
comes
every
morning
at
about
ten
and
then
we
go
on
with
lessons
till
two
and
it
does
seem
such
a
long
time
sometimes
he
takes
up
the
book
and
holds
it
close
up
to
his
face
as
if
he
were
very
but
i
know
it
only
because
he
wants
to
gape
and
miss
rottermeyer
takes
her
large
handkerchief
out
also
now
and
then
and
covers
her
face
with
it
as
if
she
was
moved
by
what
we
had
been
reading
but
that
is
only
because
she
is
longing
to
gape
too
and
i
myself
often
want
to
gape
but
i
dare
not
for
if
miss
rottermeyer
sees
me
gaping
she
runs
off
at
once
and
fetches
the
oil
and
says
i
must
have
a
dose
as
i
am
getting
weak
again
and
the
oil
is
horrible
but
now
it
will
be
much
more
amusing
for
i
shall
be
able
to
lie
back
and
listen
while
you
learn
to
read
heidi
shook
her
head
doubtfully
when
she
heard
of
learning
to
read
oh
nonsense
heidi
of
course
you
must
learn
to
read
everybody
must
and
my
tutor
is
very
kind
and
never
cross
and
he
will
explain
everything
to
you
but
mind
when
he
explains
anything
to
you
you
wo
be
able
to
understand
but
do
ask
any
questions
or
else
he
will
go
on
explaining
and
you
will
understand
less
than
ever
later
when
you
have
learnt
more
and
know
about
things
yourself
then
you
will
begin
to
understand
what
he
meant
miss
rottermeyer
now
came
back
into
the
room
she
had
not
been
able
to
overtake
dete
and
was
evidently
very
much
put
out
she
walked
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
state
of
agitation
between
the
study
and
the
and
began
scolding
the
butler
make
haste
sebastian
or
we
shall
get
no
dinner
today
at
all
she
said
then
hurrying
out
she
called
to
tinette
to
see
that
the
was
prepared
for
the
little
girl
who
had
just
arrived
meanwhile
sebastian
had
flung
open
the
folding
doors
leading
into
the
with
rather
more
noise
than
he
need
for
he
was
feeling
cross
although
he
did
not
dare
answer
back
when
miss
rottermeyer
spoke
to
him
he
went
up
to
clara
chair
to
wheel
her
into
the
next
room
heidi
stood
staring
at
him
seeing
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
he
suddenly
growled
out
well
what
is
there
in
me
to
stare
at
like
that
which
he
would
certainly
not
have
done
if
he
had
been
aware
that
miss
rottermeyer
was
just
then
entering
the
room
you
look
so
like
peter
answered
heidi
the
housekeeper
clasped
her
hands
in
horror
is
it
possible
she
stammered
she
is
now
addressing
the
servant
as
if
he
were
a
friend
i
never
could
have
imagined
such
a
child
sebastian
wheeled
the
couch
into
the
and
helped
clara
on
to
her
chair
miss
rottermeyer
took
the
seat
beside
her
and
made
a
sign
to
heidi
to
take
the
one
opposite
beside
heidi
plate
lay
a
nice
white
roll
and
her
eyes
lighted
up
with
pleasure
as
she
saw
it
when
sebastian
came
up
to
her
side
and
handed
her
the
dish
of
fish
she
looked
at
the
roll
and
asked
can
i
have
it
sebastian
nodded
and
heidi
immediately
seized
the
roll
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
sebastian
still
remained
standing
beside
heidi
it
was
not
his
duty
to
speak
nor
to
move
away
until
she
had
helped
herself
heidi
looked
wonderingly
at
him
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
said
am
i
to
eat
some
of
that
too
sebastian
nodded
again
give
me
some
then
she
said
looking
calmly
at
her
plate
i
see
i
shall
have
to
teach
you
the
first
rules
of
behavior
said
the
housekeeper
with
a
sigh
you
must
not
speak
to
sebastian
at
table
or
at
any
other
time
unless
you
have
an
order
to
give
him
and
then
you
are
not
to
address
him
as
if
he
was
some
one
belonging
to
you
never
let
me
hear
you
speak
to
him
in
that
way
again
it
is
the
same
with
tinette
and
for
myself
you
are
to
address
me
as
you
hear
others
doing
clara
must
herself
decide
what
you
are
to
call
her
why
clara
of
course
put
in
the
latter
then
followed
a
long
list
of
rules
as
to
general
behavior
during
the
course
of
which
eyes
gradually
closed
for
she
had
been
up
before
five
that
morning
and
had
had
a
long
journey
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
fell
fast
asleep
miss
rottermeyer
having
at
last
come
to
the
end
of
her
lecture
said
now
remember
what
i
have
said
adelaide
have
you
understood
it
all
heidi
has
been
asleep
for
ever
so
long
said
clara
her
face
rippling
all
over
with
amusement
for
she
had
not
had
such
an
entertaining
dinner
for
a
long
time
it
is
really
insupportable
what
one
has
to
go
through
with
this
child
exclaimed
miss
rottermeyer
in
great
indignation
and
she
rang
the
bell
so
violently
that
tinette
and
sebastian
both
came
running
in
but
no
noise
was
sufficient
to
wake
heidi
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
they
roused
her
sufficiently
to
get
her
to
her
chapter
vii
the
unfriendly
housekeeper
when
heidi
opened
her
eyes
on
her
first
morning
in
frankfurt
she
could
not
think
where
she
was
then
she
rubbed
them
and
looked
about
her
she
was
sitting
up
in
a
high
white
bed
in
a
large
wide
room
with
very
long
white
curtains
near
the
window
stood
two
chairs
covered
with
large
flowered
material
and
then
came
a
sofa
with
the
same
flowers
in
front
of
which
was
a
round
table
in
the
corner
was
a
washstand
with
things
upon
it
that
heidi
had
never
seen
in
her
life
before
but
now
all
at
once
she
remembered
that
she
was
in
frankfurt
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
dressed
herself
then
she
ran
first
to
one
window
and
then
another
she
wanted
to
see
the
sky
and
country
outside
she
felt
like
a
bird
in
a
cage
behind
those
great
curtains
but
they
were
too
heavy
for
her
to
put
aside
so
she
crept
underneath
them
to
get
to
the
window
but
she
could
see
nothing
but
walls
and
windows
she
felt
quite
frightened
and
ran
backwards
and
forwards
trying
to
open
first
one
and
then
the
other
of
the
windows
for
she
felt
that
somewhere
outside
there
must
be
the
green
grass
and
the
last
unmelted
snows
on
the
mountain
slopes
but
the
windows
remained
immovable
try
what
heidi
would
to
open
them
suddenly
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
and
immediately
after
tinette
put
her
head
inside
and
said
breakfast
is
ready
heidi
had
no
idea
what
an
invitation
so
worded
meant
and
tinette
face
did
not
encourage
any
questioning
on
heidi
part
heidi
was
sharp
enough
to
read
its
expression
and
acted
accordingly
so
she
drew
a
little
stool
out
from
under
the
table
put
it
in
the
corner
and
sat
down
upon
it
and
there
silently
awaited
what
would
happen
next
shortly
after
miss
rottermeyer
appeared
she
seemed
very
much
put
out
and
called
to
heidi
what
is
the
matter
with
you
adelaide
do
you
understand
what
breakfast
is
come
along
at
once
heidi
had
no
difficulty
in
understanding
now
and
followed
at
once
clara
gave
her
a
kindly
greeting
her
face
looking
considerably
more
cheerful
than
usual
for
she
looked
forward
to
all
kinds
of
new
things
happening
again
that
day
breakfast
passed
off
quietly
heidi
ate
her
bread
and
butter
in
a
perfectly
correct
manner
and
when
the
meal
was
over
and
clara
wheeled
back
into
the
study
miss
rottermeyer
told
her
to
follow
and
remain
with
clara
until
the
tutor
should
arrive
and
lessons
begin
as
soon
as
the
children
were
alone
again
heidi
asked
how
can
one
see
out
from
here
and
look
right
down
on
to
the
ground
you
must
open
the
window
and
look
out
replied
clara
amused
but
the
windows
wo
open
responded
heidi
sadly
yes
they
will
clara
assured
her
you
can
not
open
them
nor
i
either
but
when
you
see
sebastian
you
can
ask
him
to
open
one
it
was
a
great
relief
to
heidi
to
know
that
the
windows
could
be
opened
and
that
one
could
look
out
clara
now
began
to
ask
her
questions
about
her
home
and
heidi
was
delighted
to
tell
her
all
about
the
mountain
and
the
goats
and
the
flowery
meadows
meanwhile
her
tutor
had
arrived
miss
rottermeyer
however
did
not
bring
him
straight
into
the
study
but
drew
him
first
aside
into
the
where
she
poured
forth
her
troubles
it
appeared
that
she
had
written
some
time
back
to
sesemann
to
tell
him
that
his
daughter
very
much
desired
to
have
a
companion
miss
rottermeyer
had
wished
for
this
arrangement
on
her
own
behalf
as
it
would
relieve
her
from
having
always
to
entertain
the
sick
girl
the
father
had
answered
that
he
was
quite
willing
to
let
his
daughter
have
a
companion
provided
she
was
treated
in
every
way
like
his
own
child
but
now
she
went
on
to
explain
how
dreadfully
she
had
been
taken
in
about
the
child
and
related
all
the
unimaginable
things
of
which
she
had
already
been
guilty
so
that
not
only
would
he
have
to
begin
with
teaching
her
the
a
b
c
but
would
have
to
start
with
the
most
rudimentary
instruction
as
regarded
everything
to
do
with
daily
life
she
could
see
only
one
way
out
of
this
disastrous
state
of
affairs
and
that
was
for
the
tutor
to
declare
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
two
to
learn
together
without
detriment
to
clara
who
was
so
far
ahead
of
the
other
that
would
be
a
good
excuse
for
getting
rid
of
the
child
but
she
dared
not
send
her
home
without
sesemann
order
since
he
was
aware
that
by
this
time
the
companion
had
arrived
the
tutor
was
a
cautious
man
and
said
that
if
the
little
girl
was
backward
in
some
things
she
was
probably
advanced
in
others
and
a
little
regular
teaching
would
soon
set
the
balance
right
when
miss
rottermeyer
saw
that
he
was
not
ready
to
support
her
and
evidently
quite
ready
to
undertake
teaching
the
alphabet
she
opened
the
study
door
which
she
quickly
shut
again
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
through
remaining
on
the
other
side
herself
for
she
had
a
perfect
horror
of
the
a
b
she
walked
up
and
down
the
thinking
over
in
her
own
mind
how
the
servants
were
to
be
told
to
address
adelaide
the
father
had
written
that
she
was
to
be
treated
exactly
like
his
own
daughter
and
this
would
especially
refer
she
imagined
to
the
servants
she
was
not
allowed
however
a
very
long
interval
of
time
for
consideration
for
suddenly
the
sound
of
a
frightful
crash
was
heard
in
the
study
followed
by
frantic
cries
for
sebastian
she
rushed
into
the
room
there
on
the
floor
lay
in
a
confused
heap
books
and
inkstand
with
the
on
the
top
while
from
beneath
them
a
dark
stream
of
ink
was
flowing
all
across
the
floor
heidi
had
disappeared
here
a
state
of
things
exclaimed
miss
rottermeyer
books
everything
lying
in
the
ink
it
was
that
unfortunate
child
i
suppose
yes
heidi
did
it
explained
clara
but
quite
by
accident
she
must
on
no
account
be
punished
she
jumped
up
in
such
violent
haste
to
get
away
that
she
dragged
the
along
with
her
and
so
everything
went
over
there
were
a
number
of
vehicles
passing
that
is
why
she
rushed
off
like
that
perhaps
she
has
never
seen
a
carriage
is
it
not
as
i
said
she
has
not
the
smallest
notion
about
anything
but
where
is
the
child
who
has
caused
all
this
trouble
surely
she
has
not
run
away
what
would
sesemann
say
to
me
she
ran
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
there
at
the
bottom
standing
in
the
open
doorway
was
heidi
looking
in
amazement
up
and
down
the
street
what
are
you
doing
what
are
you
thinking
of
to
run
away
like
that
called
miss
rottermeyer
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
fir
trees
but
i
can
not
see
where
they
are
and
now
i
can
not
hear
them
any
more
answered
heidi
looking
disappointedly
in
the
direction
whence
the
noise
of
the
passing
carriages
had
reached
her
and
which
to
heidi
had
seemed
like
the
blowing
of
the
south
wind
in
the
trees
so
that
in
great
joy
of
heart
she
had
rushed
out
to
look
at
them
fir
trees
do
you
suppose
we
are
in
the
woods
what
ridiculous
ideas
are
these
come
upstairs
and
see
the
mischief
you
have
done
heidi
followed
miss
rottermeyer
upstairs
she
was
quite
astonished
to
see
the
disaster
she
had
caused
for
in
her
joy
and
haste
to
get
to
the
fir
trees
she
had
been
unaware
of
having
dragged
everything
after
her
i
excuse
you
doing
this
as
it
is
the
first
time
but
do
not
let
me
hear
of
you
doing
it
a
second
time
said
miss
rottermeyer
pointing
to
the
floor
during
your
lesson
time
you
are
to
sit
still
and
attend
if
you
can
not
do
this
i
shall
have
to
tie
you
to
your
chair
do
you
understand
yes
replied
heidi
but
i
will
certainly
not
move
again
for
now
she
understood
that
it
was
a
rule
to
sit
still
while
she
was
being
taught
when
clara
had
been
placed
on
her
couch
after
dinner
and
the
housekeeper
had
retired
to
her
room
heidi
waited
for
sebastian
who
was
coming
up
from
the
kitchen
with
a
tray
of
silver
which
he
had
to
put
away
in
the
cupboard
as
he
reached
the
top
stair
heidi
went
up
to
him
and
addressed
him
in
the
formal
manner
she
had
been
ordered
to
use
by
miss
rottermeyer
sebastian
looked
surprised
and
said
somewhat
curtly
what
is
it
you
want
miss
how
can
a
window
be
opened
why
like
that
and
sebastian
flung
up
one
of
the
large
windows
heidi
ran
to
it
but
she
was
not
tall
enough
to
see
out
for
her
head
only
reached
the
sill
there
now
miss
can
look
out
and
see
what
is
going
on
below
said
sebastian
as
he
brought
her
a
high
wooden
stool
to
stand
on
heidi
climbed
up
and
at
last
as
she
thought
was
going
to
see
what
she
had
been
longing
for
but
she
drew
back
her
head
with
a
look
of
great
disappointment
on
her
face
illustration
why
there
is
nothing
outside
but
the
stony
streets
why
there
is
nothing
outside
but
the
stony
streets
she
said
mournfully
but
if
i
went
right
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
house
what
should
i
see
there
sebastian
nothing
but
what
you
see
here
he
told
her
then
where
can
i
go
to
see
right
away
over
the
whole
valley
you
would
have
to
climb
to
the
top
of
a
high
tower
a
church
tower
like
that
one
over
there
with
the
gold
ball
above
it
heidi
got
down
quickly
from
her
stool
ran
to
the
door
down
the
steps
and
out
into
the
street
she
passed
a
great
many
people
but
they
all
seemed
in
such
a
hurry
that
heidi
thought
they
had
not
time
to
tell
her
which
way
to
go
then
suddenly
at
one
of
the
street
corners
she
saw
a
boy
carrying
a
on
his
back
and
a
animal
on
his
arm
heidi
ran
up
to
him
and
said
where
is
the
tower
with
the
gold
ball
on
the
top
i
do
know
was
the
answer
do
you
know
any
other
church
with
a
high
tower
yes
i
know
one
come
then
and
show
it
me
show
me
first
what
you
will
give
me
and
the
boy
held
out
his
hand
as
he
spoke
heidi
searched
about
in
her
pocket
and
presently
drew
out
a
card
on
which
was
painted
a
garland
of
beautiful
red
roses
she
looked
at
it
first
for
a
moment
or
two
for
she
felt
rather
sorry
to
part
with
it
clara
had
only
that
morning
made
her
a
present
of
it
but
then
to
look
down
into
the
valley
and
see
all
the
lovely
green
slopes
there
said
heidi
holding
out
the
card
would
you
like
to
have
that
the
boy
drew
back
his
hand
and
shook
his
head
what
would
you
like
then
asked
heidi
not
sorry
to
put
the
card
back
in
her
pocket
money
i
have
none
but
clara
has
i
am
sure
she
will
give
me
some
how
much
do
you
want
five
cents
come
along
then
they
started
off
together
along
the
street
and
on
the
way
heidi
asked
her
companion
what
he
was
carrying
on
his
back
it
was
a
he
told
her
which
played
beautiful
music
when
he
turned
the
handle
all
at
once
they
found
themselves
in
front
of
an
old
church
with
a
high
tower
the
boy
said
there
it
is
heidi
caught
sight
of
a
bell
in
the
wall
which
she
now
pulled
with
all
her
might
if
i
go
up
to
the
tower
you
must
wait
here
for
i
do
not
know
the
way
back
and
you
will
have
to
show
me
what
will
you
give
me
then
for
that
another
five
cents
they
heard
the
key
turning
inside
and
then
some
one
pulled
open
the
heavy
creaking
door
an
old
man
came
out
and
at
first
looked
with
surprise
and
then
in
anger
at
the
children
as
he
began
scolding
them
what
do
you
mean
by
ringing
me
down
like
this
ca
you
read
what
is
written
over
the
bell
those
who
wish
to
go
up
the
tower
but
i
do
want
to
go
up
the
tower
said
heidi
what
do
you
want
up
there
said
the
old
man
has
somebody
sent
you
no
replied
heidi
i
only
wanted
to
go
up
and
look
down
on
the
valley
get
along
home
with
you
and
do
try
this
trick
again
or
you
may
not
come
off
so
easily
a
second
time
and
with
that
he
turned
and
was
about
to
shut
the
door
but
heidi
took
hold
of
his
coat
and
said
beseechingly
let
me
go
up
just
once
he
looked
round
and
his
mood
changed
as
he
saw
her
pleading
eyes
he
took
hold
of
her
hand
and
said
kindly
well
if
you
really
wish
it
so
much
i
will
take
you
the
boy
sat
down
on
the
church
steps
to
show
that
he
was
content
to
wait
where
he
was
when
they
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
tower
the
old
man
lifted
heidi
up
that
she
might
look
out
of
the
open
window
she
saw
beneath
her
a
sea
of
roofs
towers
and
she
quickly
drew
back
her
head
and
said
in
a
sad
disappointed
voice
it
is
not
at
all
what
i
thought
you
see
now
a
child
like
you
does
not
understand
anything
about
a
view
come
along
down
and
do
go
ringing
at
my
bell
again
on
the
way
down
they
passed
the
room
at
the
far
end
of
this
was
a
large
basket
in
front
of
which
sat
a
big
grey
cat
heidi
went
up
to
the
basket
and
broke
out
into
expressions
of
delight
oh
the
sweet
little
things
the
darling
kittens
she
kept
on
saying
as
she
jumped
from
side
to
side
of
the
basket
so
as
not
to
lose
any
of
the
droll
gambols
of
the
seven
or
eight
little
kittens
that
were
scrambling
and
rolling
and
falling
over
one
another
would
you
like
to
have
one
said
the
old
man
who
enjoyed
watching
the
child
pleasure
for
myself
to
keep
said
heidi
excitedly
who
could
hardly
believe
such
happiness
was
to
be
hers
yes
of
course
more
than
one
if
you
like
in
short
you
can
take
away
the
whole
lot
if
you
have
room
for
them
for
the
old
man
was
only
too
glad
to
think
he
could
get
rid
of
his
kittens
without
more
trouble
but
how
can
i
take
them
with
me
asked
heidi
and
was
going
quickly
to
see
how
many
she
could
carry
away
in
her
hands
when
the
old
cat
sprang
at
her
so
fiercely
that
she
shrank
back
in
fear
i
will
take
them
for
you
if
you
tell
me
where
said
the
old
man
stroking
the
cat
to
quiet
her
to
sesemann
the
big
house
where
there
is
a
gold
dog
head
on
the
door
with
a
ring
in
its
mouth
explained
heidi
the
old
man
had
had
charge
of
the
tower
for
many
a
long
year
and
knew
every
house
far
and
near
i
know
the
house
he
said
but
when
shall
i
bring
them
and
who
shall
i
ask
for
you
are
not
one
of
the
family
i
am
sure
no
but
clara
will
be
so
delighted
when
i
take
her
the
kittens
if
i
could
just
take
one
or
two
away
with
me
one
for
myself
and
one
for
clara
may
i
well
wait
a
moment
said
the
man
and
he
drew
the
cat
cautiously
away
into
his
room
and
leaving
her
by
a
bowl
of
milk
came
out
again
and
shut
the
door
now
take
two
of
them
heidi
eyes
shone
with
delight
she
picked
up
a
white
kitten
and
another
striped
white
and
yellow
and
put
one
in
the
right
the
other
in
the
left
pocket
then
she
went
downstairs
the
boy
was
still
sitting
outside
on
the
steps
in
a
very
short
time
they
had
reached
the
door
with
the
large
head
for
a
knocker
heidi
rang
the
bell
sebastian
opened
it
quickly
and
when
he
saw
it
was
heidi
make
haste
make
haste
he
cried
in
a
hurried
voice
heidi
sprang
hastily
in
and
sebastian
shut
the
door
after
her
leaving
the
boy
whom
he
had
not
noticed
standing
in
wonder
on
the
steps
make
haste
little
miss
said
sebastian
again
go
straight
into
the
they
are
already
at
table
miss
rottermeyer
looks
like
a
loaded
cannon
what
could
make
the
little
miss
run
off
like
that
heidi
walked
into
the
room
the
housekeeper
did
not
look
up
clara
did
not
speak
there
was
an
uncomfortable
silence
sebastian
pushed
her
chair
up
for
her
and
when
she
was
seated
miss
rottermeyer
said
sternly
adelaide
you
have
behaved
in
a
most
unmannerly
way
by
running
out
of
the
house
as
you
did
without
asking
permission
without
any
one
knowing
a
word
about
it
and
then
to
go
wandering
about
till
this
hour
i
never
heard
of
such
behavior
before
miau
came
the
answer
back
this
was
too
much
for
the
lady
temper
with
raised
voice
she
exclaimed
you
dare
adelaide
after
your
bad
behavior
to
answer
me
as
if
it
were
a
joke
i
did
not
began
heidi
miau
miau
that
will
do
miss
rottermeyer
tried
to
say
but
her
voice
was
almost
stifled
with
anger
get
up
and
leave
the
room
heidi
stood
up
frightened
and
again
made
an
attempt
to
explain
i
really
did
not
miau
miau
miau
but
heidi
now
put
in
clara
when
you
see
that
it
makes
miss
rottermeyer
angry
why
do
you
keep
on
saying
miau
it
is
i
it
the
kittens
heidi
was
at
last
given
time
to
say
how
what
kittens
shrieked
miss
rottermeyer
sebastian
tinette
find
the
horrid
little
things
take
them
away
and
she
rose
and
fled
into
the
study
and
locked
the
door
when
sebastian
entered
the
clara
had
the
kittens
on
her
lap
and
heidi
was
kneeling
beside
her
both
laughing
and
playing
with
the
tiny
graceful
little
animals
sebastian
exclaimed
clara
as
he
came
in
you
must
help
us
you
must
find
a
bed
for
the
kittens
where
miss
rottermeyer
will
not
spy
them
out
for
she
is
so
afraid
of
them
that
she
will
send
them
away
at
once
but
we
want
to
keep
them
and
have
them
out
whenever
we
are
alone
where
can
you
put
them
i
will
see
to
that
answered
sebastian
willingly
i
will
make
a
bed
in
a
basket
and
put
it
in
some
place
where
the
lady
is
not
likely
to
go
you
leave
it
to
me
he
set
about
the
work
at
once
sniggling
to
himself
the
while
for
he
guessed
there
would
be
a
further
rumpus
about
this
some
day
and
sebastian
was
not
without
a
certain
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
miss
rottermeyer
being
a
little
disturbed
after
some
time
had
elapsed
miss
rottermeyer
opened
the
door
a
crack
and
called
through
have
you
taken
those
dreadful
little
animals
away
sebastian
he
assured
her
twice
that
he
had
done
so
and
quickly
and
quietly
catching
up
the
kittens
from
clara
lap
disappeared
with
them
miss
rottermeyer
retired
without
speaking
clara
and
heidi
following
happy
in
their
minds
at
knowing
that
the
kittens
were
lying
in
a
comfortable
bed
chapter
viii
surprises
for
the
children
the
tutor
had
just
been
shown
into
the
study
on
the
following
morning
when
there
came
a
very
loud
ring
at
the
bell
sebastian
opened
the
door
and
there
stood
a
ragged
little
boy
carrying
a
on
his
back
what
the
meaning
of
this
said
sebastian
angrily
i
teach
you
to
ring
bells
like
that
what
do
you
want
here
i
want
to
see
clara
the
boy
answered
you
little
rascal
ca
you
be
polite
enough
to
say
clara
what
do
you
want
with
her
continued
sebastian
roughly
she
owes
me
ten
cents
explained
the
boy
you
must
be
out
of
your
mind
and
how
do
you
know
that
any
young
lady
of
that
name
lives
here
she
owes
me
five
for
showing
her
the
way
there
and
five
for
showing
her
the
way
back
the
young
lady
never
goes
out
can
not
even
walk
be
off
and
get
back
to
where
you
came
from
before
i
have
to
help
you
along
but
the
boy
was
not
to
be
frightened
away
and
said
in
a
determined
voice
but
i
saw
her
in
the
street
and
can
describe
her
to
you
she
has
short
curly
black
hair
and
black
eyes
and
wears
a
brown
dress
and
does
not
talk
quite
like
we
do
oho
thought
sebastian
laughing
to
himself
the
little
miss
has
evidently
been
up
to
more
mischief
then
drawing
the
boy
inside
he
said
aloud
i
understand
now
come
with
me
and
wait
outside
the
door
till
i
tell
you
to
go
in
be
sure
you
begin
playing
your
organ
the
instant
you
get
inside
the
room
the
lady
is
very
fond
of
music
sebastian
knocked
at
the
study
door
and
a
voice
said
come
in
there
is
a
boy
outside
who
says
he
must
speak
to
miss
clara
herself
sebastian
announced
clara
was
delighted
at
such
an
extraordinary
and
unexpected
message
let
him
come
in
at
once
replied
clara
the
boy
was
already
inside
the
room
and
according
to
directions
immediately
began
to
play
his
organ
miss
rottermeyer
hearing
the
music
rushed
into
the
room
and
saw
the
ragged
boy
turning
away
at
his
organ
in
the
most
energetic
manner
leave
off
leave
off
at
once
she
screamed
but
her
voice
was
drowned
by
the
music
she
was
making
a
dash
for
the
boy
when
she
saw
something
on
the
ground
crawling
towards
her
feet
a
dreadful
dark
object
a
tortoise
at
this
sight
she
jumped
higher
than
she
had
for
many
long
years
before
shrieking
with
all
her
might
sebastian
sebastian
take
them
all
out
boy
and
animal
get
them
away
at
once
she
commanded
him
sebastian
pulled
the
boy
away
the
latter
having
quickly
caught
up
his
tortoise
and
when
he
had
got
him
outside
he
put
something
into
his
hand
there
is
the
ten
cents
from
miss
clara
and
another
ten
cents
for
the
music
you
did
it
all
quite
right
and
with
that
he
shut
the
front
door
upon
him
quietness
reigned
again
in
the
study
and
lessons
began
once
more
miss
rottermeyer
now
stayed
in
the
study
in
order
to
prevent
any
further
dreadful
illustration
miss
rottermeyer
jumped
higher
than
she
had
for
many
long
years
but
soon
another
knock
came
to
the
door
and
sebastian
again
stepped
in
this
time
to
say
that
someone
had
brought
a
large
basket
with
orders
that
it
was
to
be
given
at
once
to
miss
clara
for
me
said
clara
in
astonishment
her
curiosity
very
much
excited
bring
it
in
at
once
that
i
may
see
what
it
is
like
sebastian
carried
in
a
large
covered
basket
and
retired
i
think
the
lessons
had
better
be
finished
first
before
the
basket
is
unpacked
said
miss
rottermeyer
clara
could
not
conceive
what
was
in
it
and
cast
longing
glances
towards
it
in
the
middle
of
one
of
her
declensions
she
suddenly
broke
off
and
said
to
the
tutor
may
i
just
give
one
peep
inside
to
see
what
is
in
it
before
i
go
on
on
some
considerations
i
am
for
it
on
others
against
it
he
began
in
answer
for
it
on
the
ground
that
if
your
whole
attention
is
directed
to
the
basket
but
the
speech
remained
unfinished
the
cover
of
the
basket
was
loose
and
at
this
moment
one
two
three
and
then
two
more
kittens
came
suddenly
tumbling
on
to
the
floor
and
racing
about
the
room
in
every
direction
they
jumped
over
the
tutor
boots
climbed
up
miss
rottermeyer
dress
rolled
about
her
feet
sprang
up
on
to
clara
couch
scratching
scrambling
and
mewing
clara
kept
on
exclaiming
oh
the
dear
little
things
how
pretty
they
are
look
heidi
at
this
one
look
look
at
that
one
over
there
and
heidi
in
her
delight
kept
running
after
them
first
into
one
corner
and
then
into
the
other
the
tutor
stood
up
by
the
table
not
knowing
what
to
do
miss
rottermeyer
was
unable
at
first
to
speak
at
all
so
overcome
was
she
with
horror
and
she
did
not
dare
rise
from
her
chair
for
fear
that
all
the
dreadful
little
animals
should
jump
upon
her
at
once
at
last
she
found
voice
to
call
loudly
tinette
tinette
sebastian
sebastian
they
came
in
answer
to
her
summons
and
gathered
up
the
kittens
by
degrees
they
got
them
all
inside
the
basket
again
and
then
carried
them
off
to
put
with
the
other
two
when
miss
rottermeyer
learned
that
heidi
was
to
blame
for
having
the
kittens
brought
into
the
house
she
was
very
angry
and
said
adelaide
you
little
barbarian
you
shall
be
put
in
a
dark
cellar
with
the
rats
and
black
beetles
heidi
listened
in
silence
and
surprise
to
her
sentence
for
she
had
never
seen
a
cellar
such
as
was
now
described
the
place
known
at
her
grandfather
as
the
cellar
where
the
fresh
cheeses
and
the
new
milk
were
kept
was
a
pleasant
and
inviting
place
neither
did
she
know
at
all
what
rats
and
black
beetles
were
like
but
now
clara
interrupted
in
great
distress
no
no
miss
rottermeyer
you
must
wait
till
papa
comes
he
has
written
to
say
that
he
will
soon
be
home
and
then
i
will
tell
him
everything
and
he
will
say
what
is
to
be
done
with
heidi
miss
rottermeyer
could
not
do
anything
against
this
superior
authority
especially
as
the
father
was
really
expected
very
shortly
she
rose
and
said
with
some
displeasure
as
you
will
clara
but
i
too
shall
have
something
to
say
to
mr
sesemann
and
with
that
she
left
the
room
two
days
now
went
by
without
further
disturbance
miss
rottermeyer
however
could
not
recover
her
equanimity
she
was
perpetually
reminded
by
heidi
presence
of
the
deception
that
had
been
played
upon
her
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
ever
since
the
child
had
come
into
the
house
everything
had
been
and
she
could
not
bring
things
into
proper
order
again
clara
had
grown
much
more
cheerful
she
no
longer
found
time
hang
heavy
during
the
lesson
hours
for
heidi
was
continually
making
a
diversion
of
some
kind
or
other
she
jumbled
all
her
letters
up
together
and
seemed
quite
unable
to
learn
them
and
when
the
tutor
tried
to
draw
her
attention
to
their
different
shapes
and
to
help
her
by
showing
her
that
this
was
like
a
little
horn
or
that
like
a
bird
bill
she
would
suddenly
exclaim
in
a
joyful
voice
that
is
a
goat
that
is
a
bird
of
prey
for
the
descriptions
suggested
all
kinds
of
pictures
to
her
mind
but
left
her
still
incapable
of
the
alphabet
in
the
later
afternoons
heidi
always
sat
with
clara
and
told
her
of
the
mountain
and
of
her
life
upon
it
and
the
longing
to
return
would
become
so
overpowering
that
she
always
finished
with
the
words
now
i
must
go
home
tomorrow
i
must
really
go
but
clara
would
try
to
quiet
her
and
tell
heidi
that
she
must
wait
till
her
father
returned
and
then
they
would
see
what
was
to
be
done
after
dinner
heidi
had
to
sit
alone
in
her
room
for
a
couple
of
hours
for
she
understood
now
that
she
might
not
run
about
outside
at
frankfurt
as
she
did
on
the
mountain
and
so
she
did
not
attempt
it
at
times
she
could
hardly
contain
herself
for
the
longing
to
be
back
home
again
she
remembered
that
dete
had
told
her
that
she
could
go
home
whenever
she
liked
so
it
came
about
one
day
that
heidi
felt
she
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
she
tied
all
the
rolls
up
in
her
red
shawl
put
on
her
straw
hat
and
went
downstairs
but
just
as
she
reached
the
she
met
miss
rottermeyer
just
returning
from
a
walk
which
put
a
stop
to
heidi
journey
what
have
you
dressed
yourself
like
that
for
exclaimed
miss
rottermeyer
what
do
you
mean
by
this
have
i
not
strictly
forbidden
you
to
go
running
about
in
the
streets
and
here
you
are
ready
to
start
off
again
and
going
out
looking
like
a
beggar
i
was
not
going
to
run
about
i
was
going
home
said
heidi
frightened
what
are
you
talking
about
going
home
what
would
sesemann
say
if
he
knew
and
what
is
the
matter
with
his
house
i
should
like
to
know
have
you
ever
in
your
life
before
had
such
a
house
to
live
in
such
a
table
or
so
many
to
wait
upon
you
have
you
no
replied
heidi
i
should
think
not
indeed
continued
the
exasperated
lady
you
are
an
ungrateful
little
thing
to
be
always
thinking
of
what
naughty
thing
you
can
do
next
then
heidi
feelings
got
the
better
of
her
and
she
poured
forth
her
trouble
indeed
i
only
want
to
go
home
for
if
i
stay
so
long
away
snowflake
will
begin
crying
again
and
grandmother
is
waiting
for
me
and
greenfinch
will
get
beaten
because
i
am
not
there
to
give
peter
any
cheese
and
i
can
never
see
here
how
the
sun
says
to
the
mountains
and
if
the
great
bird
were
to
fly
over
frankfurt
he
would
croak
louder
than
ever
about
people
huddling
all
together
and
teaching
each
other
bad
things
and
not
going
to
live
up
on
the
rocks
where
it
is
so
much
better
heaven
have
mercy
on
us
the
child
is
out
of
her
mind
cried
miss
rottermeyer
and
she
turned
and
went
quickly
up
the
steps
go
and
bring
that
unhappy
little
creature
in
at
once
she
ordered
sebastian
what
are
you
in
trouble
again
said
sebastian
in
a
pleasant
voice
as
he
led
heidi
back
up
the
stairs
he
tried
to
cheer
her
up
by
telling
her
he
was
taking
good
care
of
all
the
kittens
but
she
was
too
sad
to
care
and
silently
crept
away
to
her
room
at
supper
that
evening
she
sat
without
moving
or
eating
all
she
did
was
to
hastily
hide
her
roll
in
her
pocket
next
day
miss
rottermeyer
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
supplement
heidi
clothing
with
various
garments
from
clara
wardrobe
so
as
to
give
her
a
decent
appearance
when
sesemann
returned
she
confided
her
intention
to
clara
who
was
quite
willing
to
give
up
any
number
of
dresses
and
hats
to
heidi
so
the
lady
went
upstairs
to
overhaul
the
child
belongings
and
see
what
was
to
be
kept
and
what
thrown
away
she
returned
however
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
with
an
expression
of
horror
upon
her
face
what
is
this
adelaide
that
i
find
in
your
wardrobe
she
exclaimed
i
never
heard
of
any
one
doing
such
a
thing
before
in
a
cupboard
meant
for
clothes
adelaide
what
do
i
see
at
the
bottom
but
a
heap
of
rolls
will
you
believe
it
clara
bread
in
a
wardrobe
a
whole
pile
of
bread
tinette
she
called
go
upstairs
and
take
away
all
those
rolls
out
of
adelaide
cupboard
and
the
old
straw
hat
on
the
table
no
no
screamed
heidi
i
must
keep
the
hat
and
the
rolls
are
for
grandmother
and
she
was
rushing
to
stop
tinette
when
miss
rottermeyer
caught
hold
of
her
you
will
stop
here
and
all
that
bread
and
rubbish
shall
be
taken
to
the
place
they
belong
to
she
said
in
a
determined
tone
as
she
kept
her
hand
on
the
child
to
prevent
her
running
forward
heidi
flung
herself
down
on
clara
couch
and
broke
into
a
wild
fit
of
weeping
sobbing
out
at
intervals
now
grandmother
bread
is
all
gone
they
were
all
for
grandmother
and
now
they
are
taken
away
and
grandmother
wo
have
one
and
she
wept
as
if
her
heart
would
break
she
could
not
get
over
her
sobs
for
a
long
time
she
would
never
have
been
able
to
leave
off
crying
at
all
if
it
had
not
been
for
promise
that
she
should
have
fresh
new
rolls
to
take
to
grandmother
when
the
time
came
for
her
to
go
home
when
heidi
got
into
bed
that
night
she
found
her
old
straw
hat
lying
under
the
counterpane
she
snatched
it
up
with
delight
made
it
more
out
of
shape
still
in
her
joy
and
then
after
wrapping
a
handkerchief
round
it
she
stuck
it
in
a
corner
of
the
cupboard
as
far
back
as
she
could
it
was
sebastian
who
had
hidden
it
there
for
her
he
had
been
in
the
when
tinette
was
called
and
had
heard
all
that
went
on
with
the
child
and
the
latter
loud
weeping
so
he
followed
tinette
and
when
she
came
out
of
heidi
room
carrying
the
rolls
and
the
hat
he
caught
up
the
hat
and
said
i
will
see
to
this
old
thing
chapter
ix
sesemann
takes
heidi
part
a
few
days
after
these
events
there
was
great
commotion
and
much
running
up
and
down
stairs
in
sesemann
house
the
master
had
just
returned
and
sebastian
and
tinette
were
busy
carrying
up
one
package
after
another
from
the
carriage
for
sesemann
always
brought
back
a
lot
of
pretty
things
for
his
home
he
himself
had
not
waited
to
do
anything
before
going
in
to
see
his
daughter
heidi
was
sitting
beside
her
for
it
was
late
afternoon
when
the
two
were
always
together
father
and
daughter
greeted
each
other
with
warm
affection
for
they
were
deeply
attached
to
one
another
then
he
held
out
his
hand
to
heidi
who
had
stolen
away
into
the
corner
and
said
kindly
to
her
and
this
is
our
little
swiss
girl
come
and
shake
hands
with
me
that
right
now
tell
me
are
clara
and
you
good
friends
with
one
another
or
do
you
get
angry
and
quarrel
and
then
cry
and
make
it
up
and
then
start
quarrelling
again
on
the
next
occasion
no
clara
is
always
kind
to
me
answered
heidi
and
heidi
put
in
clara
quickly
has
not
once
tried
to
quarrel
that
all
right
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
her
father
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
but
you
must
excuse
me
clara
for
i
have
had
nothing
to
eat
all
day
afterwards
i
will
show
you
all
the
things
i
have
brought
home
with
me
he
found
miss
rottermeyer
in
the
and
when
he
had
taken
his
place
she
sat
down
opposite
to
him
looking
so
gloomy
that
he
turned
to
her
and
said
what
is
the
matter
sesemann
began
the
lady
in
a
solemn
voice
we
have
been
frightfully
imposed
upon
indeed
in
what
way
asked
sesemann
as
he
went
on
calmly
drinking
his
wine
well
i
supposed
i
was
getting
a
and
nicely
brought
up
little
swiss
girl
for
clara
companion
but
i
have
been
shockingly
disgracefully
imposed
upon
but
how
what
is
there
shocking
and
disgraceful
i
see
nothing
shocking
in
the
child
remarked
sesemann
quietly
if
you
only
knew
the
kind
of
people
and
animals
she
has
brought
into
the
house
during
your
absence
the
tutor
can
tell
you
more
about
that
animals
what
am
i
to
understand
by
animals
miss
rottermeyer
it
is
past
understanding
the
whole
behavior
of
the
child
would
be
past
understanding
if
it
were
not
that
at
times
she
is
evidently
not
in
her
right
mind
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
tutor
was
announced
ah
here
is
some
one
exclaimed
sesemann
who
will
help
to
clear
up
matters
for
me
take
a
seat
he
continued
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
tutor
and
now
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
with
this
child
that
has
come
to
be
a
companion
to
my
daughter
the
tutor
started
in
his
usual
style
if
i
must
give
my
opinion
about
this
little
girl
i
should
like
first
to
state
that
if
on
one
side
there
is
a
lack
of
development
which
has
been
caused
by
the
more
or
less
careless
way
in
which
she
has
been
brought
up
my
good
friend
interrupted
sesemann
you
are
giving
yourself
more
trouble
than
you
need
i
only
want
to
know
what
your
opinion
is
as
to
her
being
a
fit
companion
or
not
for
my
daughter
i
should
not
like
in
any
way
to
prejudice
you
against
her
began
the
tutor
once
more
for
if
on
the
one
hand
there
is
a
certain
inexperience
of
the
ways
of
society
owing
to
the
uncivilized
life
she
led
up
to
the
time
of
her
removal
to
frankfurt
on
the
other
hand
she
is
endowed
with
certain
good
qualities
and
taken
on
the
whole
excuse
me
my
dear
sir
do
not
disturb
yourself
but
i
must
i
think
my
daughter
will
be
wanting
me
and
with
that
sesemann
quickly
left
the
room
and
went
into
the
study
to
talk
to
clara
and
now
my
dear
he
said
drawing
his
chair
nearer
and
laying
her
hand
in
his
what
kind
of
animals
has
your
little
companion
brought
into
the
house
and
why
does
miss
rottermeyer
think
that
she
is
not
always
in
her
right
mind
clara
had
no
difficulty
in
answering
she
told
her
father
everything
about
the
tortoise
and
the
kittens
and
explained
to
him
what
heidi
had
said
the
day
miss
rottermeyer
had
been
put
in
such
a
fright
sesemann
laughed
heartily
at
her
recital
so
you
do
not
want
me
to
send
the
child
home
again
he
asked
you
are
not
tired
of
having
her
here
oh
no
no
clara
exclaimed
please
do
not
send
her
away
time
has
passed
much
more
quickly
since
heidi
has
been
here
for
something
fresh
happens
every
day
and
it
used
to
be
so
dull
and
she
has
always
so
much
to
tell
me
that
evening
when
sesemann
and
miss
rottermeyer
were
alone
settling
the
household
affairs
he
informed
her
that
he
intended
to
keep
heidi
for
his
daughter
liked
her
as
a
companion
i
desire
he
continued
that
the
child
shall
be
in
every
way
kindly
treated
and
that
her
peculiarities
shall
not
be
looked
upon
as
crimes
if
you
find
her
too
much
for
you
alone
i
can
hold
out
a
prospect
of
help
for
i
am
expecting
my
mother
here
on
a
long
visit
and
she
as
you
know
can
get
along
with
anybody
whatever
they
may
be
like
o
yes
i
know
replied
miss
rottermeyer
but
there
was
no
tone
of
relief
in
her
voice
as
she
thought
of
the
coming
help
sesemann
was
only
home
for
a
short
time
he
left
for
paris
again
before
the
fortnight
was
over
comforting
clara
with
the
prospect
of
her
grandmother
arrival
which
was
to
take
place
in
a
few
time
clara
talked
so
much
about
her
grandmother
that
heidi
began
also
to
call
her
grandmamma
which
brought
forth
a
look
of
displeasure
from
miss
rottermeyer
as
she
was
going
to
her
room
that
night
miss
rottermeyer
waylaid
her
and
gave
her
strict
orders
not
to
call
sesemann
grandmamma
but
always
to
say
madam
chapter
x
clara
lovable
grandmother
there
was
much
expectation
and
preparation
about
the
house
on
the
following
evening
for
grandmother
sesemann
was
coming
tinette
had
a
new
white
cap
on
her
head
and
sebastian
collected
all
the
footstools
he
could
find
and
placed
them
in
convenient
spots
so
that
the
lady
might
find
one
ready
to
her
feet
whenever
she
chose
to
sit
at
last
the
carriage
came
driving
up
to
the
door
and
tinette
and
sebastian
ran
down
the
steps
followed
by
the
housekeeper
who
advanced
to
greet
the
guest
heidi
had
been
sent
up
to
her
room
and
ordered
to
remain
there
until
called
down
as
the
grandmother
would
certainly
like
to
see
clara
alone
first
heidi
sat
herself
down
in
a
corner
and
repeated
her
instructions
over
to
herself
she
had
not
to
wait
long
before
tinette
put
her
head
in
and
said
abruptly
go
downstairs
into
the
study
heidi
had
not
dared
to
ask
miss
rottermeyer
again
how
she
was
to
address
the
grandmother
she
thought
the
lady
had
perhaps
made
a
mistake
for
she
had
never
heard
any
one
called
by
other
than
their
right
name
as
she
opened
the
study
door
she
heard
a
kind
voice
say
ah
here
comes
the
child
come
along
and
let
me
have
a
good
look
at
you
heidi
walked
up
to
her
and
said
very
distinctly
in
her
clear
voice
mrs
madam
well
said
the
grandmother
laughing
is
that
how
they
address
people
in
your
home
on
the
mountain
no
replied
heidi
gravely
i
never
knew
any
one
with
that
name
before
nor
i
either
laughed
the
grandmother
again
as
she
patted
cheek
never
mind
when
i
am
with
the
children
i
am
always
grandmamma
you
wo
forget
that
name
will
you
no
no
heidi
assured
her
i
often
used
to
say
it
at
home
i
understand
said
the
grandmother
with
a
cheerful
little
nod
of
the
head
then
she
looked
more
closely
at
heidi
and
the
child
looked
back
at
her
with
steady
serious
eyes
for
there
was
something
kind
and
about
this
newcomer
that
pleased
heidi
and
indeed
everything
about
the
grandmother
attracted
her
she
had
such
beautiful
white
hair
and
two
long
lace
ends
hung
down
from
the
cap
on
her
head
and
waved
gently
about
her
face
every
time
she
moved
as
if
a
soft
breeze
were
blowing
round
her
which
gave
heidi
a
peculiar
feeling
of
pleasure
and
what
is
your
name
child
the
grandmother
now
asked
i
am
always
called
heidi
but
as
i
am
now
to
be
called
adelaide
i
will
try
and
take
care
heidi
stopped
short
for
miss
rottermeyer
was
at
this
moment
entering
the
room
sesemann
will
no
doubt
agree
with
me
she
interrupted
that
it
was
necessary
to
choose
a
name
that
could
be
pronounced
easily
if
only
for
the
sake
of
the
servants
my
worthy
rottermeyer
replied
sesemann
if
a
person
is
called
and
has
grown
accustomed
to
that
name
i
call
her
by
the
same
and
so
let
it
be
miss
rottermeyer
was
always
very
much
annoyed
that
the
old
lady
continually
addressed
her
by
her
surname
only
but
it
was
no
use
minding
for
the
grandmother
always
went
her
own
way
and
so
there
was
no
help
for
it
moreover
the
grandmother
was
a
keen
old
lady
and
had
all
her
five
wits
about
her
and
she
knew
what
was
going
on
in
the
house
as
soon
as
she
entered
it
when
on
the
following
day
clara
lay
down
as
usual
on
her
couch
after
dinner
the
grandmother
sat
down
beside
her
for
a
few
minutes
and
closed
her
eyes
then
she
got
up
again
as
lively
as
ever
and
trotted
off
into
the
no
one
was
there
heidi
is
asleep
i
suppose
she
said
to
herself
and
then
going
up
to
miss
room
she
gave
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
she
waited
a
few
minutes
and
then
miss
rottermeyer
opened
the
door
and
drew
back
in
surprise
at
this
unexpected
visit
where
is
the
child
and
what
is
she
doing
all
this
time
said
sesemann
she
is
sitting
in
her
room
where
she
could
well
employ
herself
if
she
had
the
least
idea
of
making
herself
useful
but
you
have
no
idea
sesemann
of
the
things
this
child
imagines
and
does
i
should
do
the
same
if
i
had
to
sit
in
there
like
that
child
i
can
tell
you
go
bring
her
to
my
room
i
have
some
pretty
books
with
me
that
i
should
like
to
give
her
that
is
just
the
misfortune
said
miss
rottermeyer
with
a
despairing
gesture
what
use
are
books
to
her
she
has
not
been
able
to
learn
her
a
b
c
even
all
the
long
time
she
has
been
here
it
is
quite
impossible
to
get
the
least
idea
of
them
into
her
head
and
that
the
tutor
himself
will
tell
you
if
he
had
not
the
patience
of
an
angel
he
would
have
given
up
teaching
her
long
ago
that
is
very
strange
said
sesemann
she
does
not
look
to
me
like
a
child
who
would
be
unable
to
learn
her
alphabet
heidi
now
appeared
and
gazed
with
delight
and
wonder
at
the
beautiful
colored
pictures
in
the
books
which
the
grandmother
gave
her
to
look
at
all
of
a
sudden
the
child
gave
a
start
and
burst
into
sobs
for
she
had
turned
to
a
picture
of
a
green
pasture
full
of
young
animals
some
grazing
and
others
nibbling
at
the
shrubs
in
the
middle
was
a
shepherd
leaning
upon
his
staff
and
looking
on
at
his
happy
flock
the
grandmother
laid
her
hand
kindly
on
heidi
do
cry
dear
child
do
cry
she
said
the
picture
has
reminded
you
perhaps
of
something
but
see
there
is
a
beautiful
tale
to
the
picture
which
i
will
tell
you
this
evening
and
there
are
other
nice
tales
of
all
kinds
to
read
and
to
tell
again
but
now
we
must
have
a
little
talk
together
so
dry
your
tears
and
come
and
stand
in
front
of
me
and
tell
me
how
you
are
getting
on
in
your
do
you
like
your
lessons
and
have
you
learnt
a
great
deal
o
no
replied
heidi
sighing
but
i
knew
beforehand
that
it
was
not
possible
to
learn
what
is
it
you
think
impossible
to
learn
why
to
read
it
is
too
difficult
you
do
say
so
and
who
told
you
that
peter
told
me
and
he
knew
all
about
it
for
he
had
tried
and
tried
and
could
not
learn
it
peter
must
be
a
very
odd
boy
then
but
listen
heidi
you
must
not
always
go
by
what
peter
says
you
must
believe
what
i
tell
you
and
i
tell
you
that
you
can
learn
to
read
in
a
very
little
while
as
many
other
children
do
who
are
made
like
you
and
not
like
peter
as
soon
as
you
are
able
to
read
you
shall
have
that
book
for
your
own
heidi
had
listened
with
eager
attention
to
the
grandmother
words
and
now
with
a
sigh
exclaimed
oh
if
only
i
could
read
now
it
wo
take
you
long
now
to
learn
that
i
can
see
and
now
we
must
go
down
to
clara
bring
the
books
with
you
and
hand
in
hand
the
two
returned
to
the
study
since
the
day
when
heidi
had
so
longed
to
go
home
and
miss
rottermeyer
had
met
her
and
scolded
her
on
the
steps
and
told
her
how
wicked
and
ungrateful
she
was
to
try
and
run
away
a
change
had
come
over
the
child
she
at
last
understood
that
she
could
not
go
home
when
she
wished
as
dete
had
told
her
but
that
she
would
have
to
stay
on
in
frankfurt
for
a
long
long
time
perhaps
for
ever
the
weight
of
trouble
on
the
little
heart
grew
heavier
and
heavier
she
could
no
longer
eat
her
food
and
every
day
she
grew
a
little
paler
she
lay
awake
for
long
hours
at
night
for
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
and
everything
was
still
around
her
the
picture
of
the
mountain
with
its
sunshine
and
flowers
rose
vividly
before
her
eyes
and
when
at
last
she
fell
asleep
it
was
to
dream
of
the
rocks
and
the
turning
crimson
in
the
evening
light
and
waking
in
the
morning
she
would
think
herself
back
at
the
hut
and
prepare
to
run
joyfully
out
into
the
sun
and
then
there
was
her
large
bed
and
here
she
was
in
frankfurt
far
far
away
from
home
and
heidi
would
often
lay
her
face
down
on
the
pillow
and
weep
long
and
quietly
so
that
no
one
might
hear
her
her
unhappiness
did
not
escape
the
grandmother
notice
one
day
she
called
her
into
her
room
and
said
now
tell
me
heidi
what
is
the
matter
are
you
in
trouble
but
heidi
afraid
if
she
told
the
truth
that
the
grandmother
would
think
her
ungrateful
and
would
then
leave
off
being
so
kind
to
her
answered
i
ca
tell
you
well
could
you
tell
clara
about
it
oh
no
i
can
not
tell
any
one
said
heidi
in
so
positive
a
tone
and
with
a
look
of
such
trouble
on
her
face
that
the
grandmother
felt
full
of
pity
for
the
child
then
dear
child
let
me
tell
you
what
to
do
you
know
that
when
we
are
in
great
trouble
and
can
not
speak
about
it
to
anybody
we
must
turn
to
god
and
pray
him
to
help
you
say
your
prayers
every
evening
do
you
not
no
i
never
say
any
prayers
answered
heidi
have
you
never
been
taught
to
pray
heidi
do
you
not
know
even
what
it
means
i
used
to
say
prayers
with
the
first
grandmother
but
that
is
a
long
time
ago
and
i
have
forgotten
them
that
is
the
reason
heidi
that
you
are
so
unhappy
because
you
know
no
one
who
can
help
you
think
what
a
comfort
it
is
to
be
able
to
tell
everything
to
god
and
pray
him
for
the
help
that
no
one
else
can
give
us
and
he
can
aid
us
and
give
us
everything
that
will
make
us
happy
again
a
sudden
gleam
of
joy
came
into
heidi
eyes
may
i
tell
him
everything
everything
yes
everything
heidi
everything
heidi
drew
her
hand
away
which
the
grandmother
was
holding
affectionately
between
her
own
and
said
quickly
may
i
go
yes
of
course
was
the
answer
and
heidi
ran
out
of
the
room
into
her
own
and
sitting
herself
on
a
stool
folded
her
hands
together
and
told
god
about
everything
that
was
making
her
so
sad
and
unhappy
and
begged
him
earnestly
to
help
her
and
to
let
her
go
home
to
her
grandfather
it
was
about
a
week
after
this
that
the
tutor
informed
sesemann
that
heidi
had
really
learnt
to
read
at
last
illustration
grandmother
kind
advice
brings
comfort
to
heidi
it
is
indeed
truly
marvelous
he
said
because
she
never
seemed
able
to
even
learn
her
a
b
c
before
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
make
no
further
attempts
at
the
impossible
but
to
put
the
letters
as
they
were
before
her
without
any
dissertation
on
their
origin
and
meaning
now
she
has
learnt
her
letters
and
started
at
once
to
read
correctly
quite
unlike
most
beginners
that
same
evening
heidi
found
the
large
book
with
the
pictures
lying
on
her
plate
when
she
took
her
place
at
table
and
when
she
looked
questioningly
at
the
grandmother
the
latter
nodded
kindly
to
her
and
said
yes
it
yours
now
mine
to
keep
always
even
when
i
go
home
said
heidi
blushing
with
pleasure
yes
of
course
yours
for
ever
the
grandmother
assured
her
tomorrow
we
will
begin
to
read
it
but
you
are
not
going
home
yet
heidi
not
for
years
put
in
clara
when
grandmother
goes
away
i
shall
want
you
to
stay
on
with
me
when
heidi
went
to
her
room
that
night
she
had
another
look
at
her
book
before
going
to
bed
and
from
that
day
forth
her
chief
pleasure
was
to
read
over
and
over
again
the
tales
which
belonged
to
the
beautiful
pictures
chapter
xi
every
afternoon
when
clara
was
resting
after
dinner
the
grandmother
would
take
heidi
to
her
own
room
where
she
had
a
lot
of
pretty
dolls
and
she
showed
her
how
to
make
dresses
and
aprons
for
them
so
that
the
child
learned
how
to
sew
and
to
make
all
sorts
of
beautiful
clothes
for
the
little
people
and
then
grandmother
liked
to
hear
her
read
aloud
and
the
oftener
heidi
read
her
tales
the
fonder
she
grew
of
them
but
still
she
never
looked
really
happy
and
her
eyes
were
no
longer
bright
it
was
the
last
week
of
the
grandmother
visit
she
called
heidi
into
her
room
as
usual
one
day
after
dinner
and
the
child
came
with
her
book
under
her
arm
the
old
lady
laid
the
book
aside
and
said
now
my
dear
tell
me
why
you
are
not
happy
have
you
still
the
same
trouble
at
heart
heidi
nodded
in
reply
have
you
told
god
about
it
yes
and
do
you
pray
every
day
that
he
will
make
things
right
and
that
you
may
be
happy
again
no
i
have
left
off
praying
do
not
tell
me
that
heidi
why
have
you
left
off
praying
illustration
heidi
learns
to
make
doll
clothes
it
is
of
no
use
god
does
not
listen
heidi
went
on
in
an
agitated
voice
and
i
can
understand
that
when
there
are
so
many
many
people
in
frankfurt
praying
to
him
every
evening
that
he
can
not
attend
to
them
all
and
he
certainly
has
not
heard
what
i
said
to
him
and
why
are
you
so
sure
of
that
heidi
because
i
have
prayed
for
the
same
thing
every
day
for
weeks
and
yet
god
has
not
done
what
i
asked
you
are
wrong
heidi
you
must
not
think
of
him
like
that
god
is
a
good
father
to
us
all
and
knows
better
than
we
do
what
is
good
for
us
he
did
not
think
what
you
have
been
praying
for
was
good
for
you
just
now
but
be
sure
he
heard
you
for
he
can
hear
and
see
every
one
at
the
same
time
because
he
is
a
god
and
not
a
human
being
like
you
and
me
while
god
is
watching
over
you
and
looking
to
see
if
you
will
trust
him
and
go
on
praying
to
him
every
day
you
run
away
and
leave
off
saying
your
prayers
and
forget
all
about
him
you
would
not
like
to
grieve
god
would
you
heidi
when
he
only
wants
to
be
kind
to
you
so
will
you
not
go
and
ask
him
to
forgive
you
and
continue
to
pray
and
to
trust
him
for
you
may
be
sure
that
he
will
make
everything
right
and
happy
for
you
and
then
you
will
be
glad
and
lighthearted
again
heidi
had
perfect
confidence
in
the
grandmother
and
every
word
she
said
sank
into
her
heart
i
will
go
at
once
and
ask
god
to
forgive
me
and
i
will
never
forget
him
again
she
replied
repentantly
and
she
ran
away
and
prayed
that
she
might
always
remember
god
and
that
he
would
go
on
thinking
about
her
the
day
came
for
grandmother
departure
a
sad
one
for
clara
and
heidi
but
the
grandmother
was
determined
to
make
it
as
much
like
a
holiday
as
possible
and
not
to
let
them
mope
and
she
kept
them
so
lively
and
amused
that
they
had
no
time
to
think
about
their
sorrow
at
her
going
until
she
really
drove
away
then
the
house
seemed
so
silent
and
empty
that
heidi
and
clara
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
and
sat
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
like
two
lost
children
many
weeks
passed
away
heidi
did
not
know
if
it
was
winter
or
summer
for
the
walls
and
windows
she
looked
out
upon
showed
no
change
and
she
never
went
beyond
the
house
except
on
rare
occasions
when
clara
was
well
enough
to
drive
out
and
then
they
only
went
a
very
little
way
as
clara
could
not
bear
the
movement
for
long
on
these
occasions
they
generally
only
saw
more
fine
streets
and
large
houses
and
crowds
of
people
they
seldom
got
anywhere
beyond
them
and
grass
and
flowers
fir
trees
and
mountains
were
still
far
away
heidi
longing
for
the
old
familiar
and
beautiful
things
grew
daily
stronger
so
that
now
only
to
read
a
word
that
recalled
them
to
her
remembrance
brought
her
to
the
verge
of
tears
which
she
suppressed
with
difficulty
so
the
autumn
and
winter
passed
and
again
the
sun
came
shining
down
on
the
white
walls
of
the
opposite
houses
and
heidi
would
think
to
herself
that
now
the
time
had
come
for
peter
to
go
out
again
with
the
goats
to
where
the
golden
flowers
of
the
cistus
were
glowing
in
the
sunlight
and
all
the
rocks
around
turned
to
fire
at
sunset
she
would
go
and
sit
in
a
corner
of
her
lonely
room
and
put
her
hands
up
to
her
eyes
that
she
might
not
see
the
sun
shining
on
the
opposite
wall
and
then
she
would
remain
without
moving
battling
silently
with
her
terrible
until
clara
sent
for
her
again
chapter
xii
my
house
is
haunted
for
some
days
past
miss
rottermeyer
had
gone
about
rather
silently
and
as
if
lost
in
thought
as
twilight
fell
and
she
passed
from
room
to
room
or
along
the
long
corridors
she
was
seen
to
look
cautiously
behind
her
and
into
the
dark
corners
as
if
she
thought
some
one
was
coming
up
silently
behind
her
and
might
unexpectedly
give
her
dress
a
pull
nor
would
she
now
go
alone
into
some
parts
of
the
house
if
she
visited
the
upper
floor
where
the
grand
were
or
had
to
go
down
into
the
large
drawing
room
where
every
footstep
echoed
she
called
tinette
to
accompany
her
for
something
very
strange
and
mysterious
was
going
on
in
sesemann
house
every
morning
when
the
servants
went
downstairs
they
found
the
front
door
wide
open
although
nobody
could
be
seen
far
or
near
to
account
for
it
during
the
first
few
days
that
this
happened
every
room
and
corner
was
searched
in
great
alarm
to
see
if
anything
had
been
stolen
for
the
general
idea
was
that
a
thief
had
been
hiding
in
the
house
and
had
gone
off
in
the
night
with
the
stolen
goods
but
not
a
thing
in
the
house
had
been
touched
everything
was
safe
in
its
place
the
door
was
doubly
locked
at
night
and
for
further
security
the
wooden
bar
was
fastened
across
it
but
it
was
no
good
next
morning
the
door
again
stood
open
at
last
after
a
great
deal
of
persuasion
from
miss
rottermeyer
sebastian
and
john
plucked
up
courage
and
agreed
to
sit
up
one
night
to
watch
and
see
what
would
happen
miss
rottermeyer
hunted
up
several
weapons
belonging
to
the
master
and
gave
these
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
to
them
so
that
their
courage
might
not
faint
if
it
came
to
a
fight
on
the
appointed
night
the
two
sat
down
and
began
at
once
to
take
some
of
the
strengthening
cordial
which
at
first
made
them
very
talkative
and
then
very
sleepy
so
that
they
leant
back
in
their
seats
and
became
silent
as
midnight
struck
sebastian
roused
himself
and
called
to
his
companion
who
however
was
not
easy
to
wake
and
kept
rolling
his
head
first
to
one
side
and
then
the
other
and
continuing
to
sleep
sebastian
began
to
listen
more
attentively
for
he
was
wide
awake
now
he
did
not
feel
inclined
to
go
to
sleep
again
for
the
stillness
was
ghostly
to
him
and
he
was
afraid
now
to
raise
his
voice
to
rouse
john
so
he
shook
him
gently
to
make
him
stir
at
last
as
one
struck
john
woke
up
and
came
back
to
the
consciousness
of
why
he
was
sitting
in
a
chair
instead
of
lying
in
his
bed
he
got
up
with
a
great
show
of
courage
and
said
come
sebastian
we
must
go
out
in
the
hall
and
see
what
is
going
on
you
need
not
be
afraid
just
follow
me
whereupon
he
opened
the
door
wide
and
stepped
into
the
hall
just
as
he
did
so
a
sudden
gust
of
air
blew
through
the
open
front
door
and
put
out
the
light
which
john
held
in
his
hand
he
started
back
almost
overturning
sebastian
whom
he
clutched
and
pulled
back
into
the
room
and
then
shutting
the
door
quickly
he
turned
the
key
as
far
as
he
could
make
it
go
then
he
pulled
out
his
matches
and
lighted
his
candle
again
sebastian
in
the
suddenness
of
the
affair
did
not
know
exactly
what
had
happened
for
he
had
not
seen
the
open
front
door
or
felt
the
breeze
behind
john
broad
figure
but
now
as
he
saw
the
latter
in
the
light
he
gave
a
cry
of
alarm
for
john
was
trembling
all
over
and
was
as
white
as
a
ghost
what
the
matter
what
did
you
see
outside
asked
sebastian
sympathetically
the
door
partly
open
gasped
john
and
a
white
figure
standing
at
the
top
of
the
steps
there
it
stood
and
then
all
in
a
minute
it
disappeared
sebastian
felt
his
blood
run
cold
the
two
sat
down
close
to
one
another
and
did
not
dare
move
again
till
the
morning
broke
and
the
streets
began
to
be
alive
again
then
they
left
the
room
together
shut
the
front
door
and
went
upstairs
to
tell
miss
rottermeyer
of
their
experience
they
had
no
sooner
given
her
details
of
the
experience
than
she
sat
down
and
wrote
to
sesemann
who
had
never
received
such
a
letter
before
in
his
life
she
could
hardly
write
she
told
him
for
her
fingers
were
stiff
with
fear
and
sesemann
must
please
arrange
to
come
back
at
once
for
dreadful
and
unaccountable
things
were
taking
place
at
home
then
she
entered
into
particulars
of
all
that
had
happened
of
how
the
door
was
found
standing
open
every
morning
sesemann
answered
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
him
to
arrange
to
leave
his
business
and
return
home
at
once
miss
rottermeyer
however
was
determined
not
to
pass
any
more
days
in
a
state
of
fear
and
she
knew
the
right
course
to
pursue
she
had
as
yet
said
nothing
to
the
children
of
the
ghostly
apparitions
for
she
knew
if
she
did
that
the
children
would
not
remain
alone
for
a
single
moment
and
that
might
entail
discomfort
for
herself
but
now
she
walked
straight
off
into
the
study
and
there
in
a
low
mysterious
voice
told
the
two
children
everything
that
had
taken
place
clara
immediately
screamed
out
that
she
could
not
remain
another
minute
alone
her
father
must
come
home
so
miss
rottermeyer
wrote
another
letter
to
sesemann
stating
that
these
unaccountable
things
that
were
going
on
in
the
house
had
so
affected
his
daughter
delicate
constitution
that
the
worst
consequences
might
be
expected
epileptic
fits
and
vitus
dance
often
came
on
suddenly
in
cases
like
this
and
clara
was
liable
to
be
attacked
by
either
if
the
cause
of
the
general
alarm
was
not
removed
the
letter
was
successful
and
two
days
later
sesemann
arrived
home
clara
greeted
him
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
seeing
her
so
lively
and
apparently
as
well
as
ever
his
face
cleared
and
the
frown
of
anxiety
passed
gradually
away
from
it
as
he
heard
from
his
daughter
own
lips
that
she
had
nothing
the
matter
with
her
and
moreover
was
so
delighted
to
see
him
that
she
was
quite
glad
about
the
ghost
as
it
was
the
cause
of
bringing
him
home
again
and
how
is
the
ghost
getting
on
he
asked
turning
to
miss
rottermeyer
with
a
twinkle
of
amusement
in
his
eye
it
is
no
joke
i
assure
you
replied
that
lady
you
will
not
laugh
yourself
tomorrow
morning
sesemann
what
is
going
on
in
the
house
points
to
some
terrible
thing
that
has
taken
place
in
the
past
and
been
concealed
well
i
know
nothing
about
that
said
the
master
of
the
house
but
i
must
beg
you
not
to
bring
suspicion
on
my
worthy
ancestors
and
now
will
you
kindly
call
sebastian
into
the
as
i
wish
to
speak
to
him
alone
sesemann
had
been
quite
aware
that
sebastian
and
miss
rottermeyer
were
not
on
the
best
of
terms
and
he
had
his
ideas
about
this
scare
come
here
lad
he
said
as
sebastian
appeared
and
tell
me
frankly
have
you
been
playing
at
ghosts
to
amuse
yourself
at
miss
rottermeyer
expense
no
on
my
honor
sir
pray
do
not
think
it
i
am
very
uncomfortable
about
the
matter
myself
answered
sebastian
with
unmistakable
truthfulness
well
if
that
is
so
i
will
show
you
and
john
tomorrow
morning
how
ghosts
look
in
the
daylight
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
sebastian
a
great
strong
lad
like
you
to
run
away
from
a
ghost
but
now
go
and
take
a
message
to
my
old
friend
the
doctor
give
him
my
kind
regards
and
ask
if
he
will
come
to
me
tonight
at
nine
without
fail
i
have
come
by
express
from
paris
to
consult
him
i
shall
want
him
to
spend
the
night
here
so
bad
a
case
is
it
so
will
he
arrange
accordingly
you
understand
yes
sir
replied
sebastian
i
will
see
to
the
matter
as
you
wish
punctually
at
nine
after
the
children
and
miss
rottermeyer
had
retired
the
doctor
arrived
he
was
a
man
with
a
fresh
face
and
two
bright
kindly
eyes
he
looked
anxious
as
he
walked
in
but
on
catching
sight
of
his
patient
burst
out
laughing
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
well
he
said
you
look
pretty
bad
for
a
person
that
i
am
to
sit
up
with
all
night
patience
friend
answered
sesemann
the
one
you
have
to
sit
up
for
will
look
a
good
deal
worse
when
we
have
once
caught
him
for
there
is
a
ghost
in
the
house
the
doctor
laughed
again
that
a
nice
way
of
showing
sympathy
doctor
continued
sesemann
it
a
pity
my
friend
rottermeyer
can
not
hear
you
she
is
firmly
convinced
that
some
old
member
of
the
family
is
wandering
about
the
house
doing
penance
for
some
awful
crime
he
committed
how
did
she
become
acquainted
with
him
asked
the
doctor
still
very
much
amused
so
sesemann
recounted
to
him
how
the
front
door
was
nightly
opened
by
somebody
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
combined
household
the
whole
thing
was
either
a
joke
gotten
up
by
some
friend
of
the
servants
just
to
alarm
the
household
while
he
was
away
or
else
it
was
a
thief
who
by
leading
everybody
at
first
to
think
there
was
a
ghost
made
it
safe
for
himself
when
he
came
later
to
steal
as
no
one
would
venture
to
run
out
if
they
heard
him
the
two
took
up
their
quarters
for
the
night
in
the
same
room
in
which
sebastian
and
john
had
kept
watch
the
door
was
shut
close
to
prevent
the
light
being
seen
in
the
hall
outside
which
might
frighten
away
the
ghost
the
gentlemen
sat
comfortably
back
in
the
and
began
talking
of
all
sorts
of
things
now
and
then
pausing
to
take
a
good
draught
of
wine
and
so
twelve
struck
before
they
were
aware
the
ghost
has
got
scent
of
us
and
is
keeping
away
tonight
said
the
doctor
wait
a
bit
it
does
not
generally
appear
before
one
answered
his
friend
they
started
talking
again
one
struck
there
was
not
a
sound
about
the
house
nor
in
the
street
outside
suddenly
the
doctor
lifted
his
finger
hush
sesemann
do
you
hear
something
they
both
listened
and
they
distinctly
heard
the
bar
softly
pushed
aside
and
then
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
the
door
opened
sesemann
put
out
his
hand
for
his
revolver
you
are
not
afraid
are
you
said
the
doctor
as
he
stood
up
it
is
better
to
take
precautions
whispered
sesemann
and
seizing
one
of
the
lights
in
his
other
hand
he
followed
the
doctor
who
armed
in
like
manner
with
a
light
and
a
revolver
went
softly
on
in
front
they
stepped
into
the
hall
the
moonlight
was
shining
in
through
the
open
door
and
fell
on
a
white
figure
standing
motionless
in
the
doorway
who
is
there
thundered
the
doctor
in
a
voice
that
echoed
through
the
hall
as
the
two
men
advanced
with
lights
and
weapons
towards
the
figure
it
turned
and
gave
a
low
cry
there
in
her
little
white
nightgown
stood
heidi
with
bare
feet
staring
with
wild
eyes
at
the
lights
and
the
revolvers
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
like
a
leaf
in
the
wind
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
in
surprise
why
i
believe
it
is
heidi
said
the
doctor
child
what
does
this
mean
said
sesemann
what
did
you
want
why
did
you
come
down
here
white
with
terror
and
hardly
able
to
make
her
voice
heard
heidi
answered
i
do
know
but
now
the
doctor
stepped
forward
this
is
a
matter
for
me
to
see
to
sesemann
go
back
to
your
chair
i
must
take
the
child
upstairs
to
her
bed
and
with
that
he
put
down
his
revolver
and
gently
taking
the
child
by
the
hand
led
her
upstairs
do
be
frightened
he
said
as
they
went
up
side
by
side
it
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
it
all
right
only
just
go
quietly
on
reaching
heidi
room
the
doctor
put
the
candle
down
on
the
table
and
taking
heidi
up
in
his
arms
laid
her
on
the
bed
and
carefully
covered
her
over
then
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
waited
until
she
had
grown
quieter
and
no
longer
trembled
so
violently
he
then
took
her
hand
and
said
in
a
kind
soothing
voice
there
now
you
feel
better
and
now
tell
me
where
you
were
wanting
to
go
to
i
did
not
want
to
go
anywhere
said
heidi
i
did
not
know
i
went
downstairs
but
all
at
once
i
was
there
i
see
and
had
you
been
dreaming
so
that
you
seemed
to
see
and
hear
something
very
distinctly
illustration
the
doctor
discovers
heidi
yes
i
dream
every
night
and
always
about
the
same
things
i
think
i
am
back
with
grandfather
and
i
hear
the
sound
in
the
fir
trees
outside
and
i
see
the
stars
shining
so
brightly
and
then
i
open
the
door
quickly
and
run
out
and
it
is
all
so
beautiful
but
when
i
wake
i
am
still
in
frankfurt
and
heidi
struggled
as
she
spoke
to
keep
back
the
sobs
which
seemed
to
choke
her
and
have
you
no
pain
anywhere
no
pain
in
your
head
or
back
no
only
a
feeling
as
if
there
were
a
great
stone
weighing
on
me
here
as
if
you
had
eaten
something
that
would
not
go
down
no
not
like
that
something
heavy
as
if
i
wanted
to
cry
very
much
i
see
and
then
do
you
have
a
good
cry
oh
no
i
must
miss
rottermeyer
forbade
me
to
cry
so
you
swallow
it
all
down
i
suppose
are
you
happy
here
in
frankfurt
yes
was
the
low
answer
but
it
sounded
more
like
no
and
where
did
you
live
with
your
grandfather
up
on
the
mountain
that
was
very
amusing
rather
dull
at
times
eh
no
no
it
was
beautiful
beautiful
heidi
could
go
no
further
the
remembrance
of
the
past
the
excitement
she
had
just
gone
through
the
long
suppressed
weeping
were
too
much
for
the
child
strength
the
tears
began
to
fall
fast
and
she
broke
into
violent
weeping
the
doctor
patted
her
head
kindly
there
there
go
on
crying
it
will
do
you
good
and
then
go
to
sleep
it
will
be
all
right
tomorrow
then
he
left
the
room
and
went
downstairs
to
sesemann
when
he
was
once
more
sitting
in
the
opposite
his
friend
sesemann
he
said
let
me
first
tell
you
that
your
little
charge
is
a
she
is
the
ghost
who
has
nightly
opened
the
front
door
and
put
your
household
into
this
fever
of
alarm
secondly
the
child
is
consumed
with
to
such
an
extent
that
she
is
nearly
a
skeleton
already
and
soon
will
be
quite
one
something
must
be
done
at
once
there
is
but
one
remedy
and
that
is
to
send
her
back
to
her
native
mountain
air
so
tomorrow
the
child
must
start
for
home
there
you
have
my
prescription
sesemann
had
risen
and
now
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
the
greatest
state
of
concern
what
he
exclaimed
the
child
a
and
ill
all
this
has
taken
place
in
my
house
and
no
one
noticed
it
and
you
mean
doctor
that
the
child
who
came
here
happy
and
healthy
i
am
to
send
back
to
her
grandfather
a
miserable
little
skeleton
i
ca
do
it
you
can
not
dream
of
my
doing
such
a
thing
take
the
child
in
hand
do
with
her
what
you
will
and
make
her
whole
and
sound
and
then
she
shall
go
home
but
you
must
cure
her
first
sesemann
replied
the
doctor
this
illness
of
the
child
is
not
one
to
be
cured
with
pills
and
powders
the
child
has
not
a
strong
constitution
but
if
you
send
her
back
at
once
she
may
recover
in
the
mountain
air
if
not
you
would
rather
she
went
back
ill
than
not
at
all
sesemann
stood
still
the
doctor
words
were
a
shock
to
him
if
you
put
it
so
doctor
there
is
assuredly
only
one
way
and
that
is
to
send
her
home
at
once
chapter
xiii
at
home
again
on
the
mountain
at
daylight
sesemann
went
quickly
upstairs
and
along
the
passage
to
miss
rottermeyer
room
and
there
gave
such
an
unusually
loud
knock
at
the
door
that
the
lady
awoke
from
sleep
with
a
cry
of
alarm
she
heard
the
master
of
the
house
calling
to
her
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
please
make
haste
and
come
down
to
the
we
must
make
ready
for
a
journey
at
once
when
miss
rottermeyer
came
down
with
everything
well
adjusted
about
her
except
her
cap
which
was
put
on
hind
side
before
sesemann
began
without
delay
to
give
her
directions
she
was
to
get
out
a
trunk
and
pack
up
all
the
things
belonging
to
heidi
and
a
good
part
of
clara
clothes
as
well
so
that
the
child
might
take
home
proper
apparel
miss
rottermeyer
stood
as
if
rooted
to
the
spot
and
stared
in
astonishment
at
sesemann
she
had
quite
expected
a
long
private
account
of
some
terrible
ghostly
experience
of
his
during
the
night
but
sesemann
had
no
thought
or
time
for
explanations
and
left
her
standing
there
while
he
went
to
speak
to
clara
he
told
her
everything
that
had
occurred
during
the
past
night
and
explained
how
nightly
wanderings
might
gradually
lead
her
farther
and
farther
perhaps
even
on
to
the
roof
which
of
course
would
be
very
dangerous
for
her
and
so
they
had
decided
to
send
her
home
at
once
as
he
did
not
like
to
take
the
responsibility
of
her
remaining
and
clara
would
see
for
herself
that
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
clara
was
very
much
distressed
and
at
first
made
all
kinds
of
suggestions
for
keeping
heidi
with
her
but
her
father
was
firm
and
promised
her
if
she
would
be
reasonable
and
make
no
further
fuss
that
he
would
take
her
to
switzerland
next
summer
next
he
sent
for
sebastian
and
told
him
to
make
ready
to
start
he
was
to
travel
with
heidi
as
far
as
basle
that
day
and
the
next
day
take
her
home
he
would
give
him
a
letter
to
carry
to
the
grandfather
which
would
explain
everything
and
he
could
then
return
to
frankfurt
but
there
is
one
thing
in
particular
which
i
wish
you
to
look
after
said
sesemann
in
conclusion
when
you
reach
the
hotel
go
at
once
into
the
child
room
and
see
that
the
windows
are
all
firmly
fastened
so
that
they
can
not
be
easily
opened
after
heidi
is
in
bed
lock
the
door
of
her
room
on
the
outside
for
the
child
walks
in
her
sleep
and
might
run
into
danger
in
a
strange
house
if
she
went
wandering
downstairs
and
tried
to
open
the
front
door
so
you
understand
oh
then
that
was
it
exclaimed
sebastian
for
now
a
light
was
thrown
on
the
ghostly
visitations
yes
that
was
it
and
you
are
a
coward
and
you
may
tell
john
he
is
the
same
and
the
whole
household
a
pack
of
idiots
and
with
this
sesemann
went
off
to
his
study
to
write
a
letter
to
meanwhile
heidi
was
standing
expectantly
dressed
in
her
sunday
frock
waiting
to
see
what
would
happen
next
for
tinette
had
awakened
her
with
a
shake
and
put
on
her
clothes
without
a
word
of
explanation
the
little
uneducated
child
was
far
too
much
beneath
her
for
tinette
to
speak
to
when
she
appeared
at
the
breakfast
table
sesemann
said
you
are
going
home
today
little
one
home
murmured
heidi
in
a
low
voice
turning
pale
she
was
so
overcome
that
for
a
moment
or
two
she
could
hardly
breathe
do
you
want
to
hear
more
about
it
oh
yes
yes
exclaimed
heidi
her
face
now
rosy
with
delight
all
right
then
said
sesemann
as
he
sat
down
and
made
her
a
sign
to
do
the
same
but
now
eat
a
good
breakfast
and
then
off
you
go
in
the
carriage
but
heidi
could
not
swallow
a
morsel
though
she
tried
to
do
what
she
was
told
she
was
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
that
she
hardly
knew
if
she
was
awake
or
dreaming
or
if
she
would
again
open
her
eyes
to
find
herself
in
her
nightgown
at
the
front
door
tell
sebastian
to
take
plenty
of
provisions
with
him
sesemann
called
out
to
miss
rottermeyer
who
just
then
came
into
the
room
the
child
ca
eat
anything
now
which
is
quite
natural
now
run
up
to
clara
and
stay
with
her
till
the
carriage
comes
round
he
added
kindly
turning
to
heidi
heidi
had
been
longing
for
this
and
ran
quickly
upstairs
an
immense
trunk
was
standing
open
in
the
middle
of
the
room
oh
heidi
cried
clara
as
she
entered
see
all
the
things
i
have
had
put
in
for
you
are
you
pleased
and
she
ran
over
a
list
of
things
dresses
and
aprons
and
handkerchiefs
and
all
kinds
of
working
materials
and
look
here
she
added
as
she
triumphantly
held
up
a
basket
heidi
peeped
in
and
jumped
for
joy
for
inside
it
were
twelve
beautiful
round
white
rolls
all
for
grandmother
in
their
delight
the
children
forgot
that
the
time
had
come
for
them
to
separate
and
when
some
one
called
out
the
carriage
is
here
there
was
no
time
for
grieving
heidi
ran
to
her
room
to
fetch
her
darling
book
she
knew
no
one
could
have
packed
that
as
it
lay
under
her
pillow
for
she
had
kept
it
by
her
night
and
day
this
was
put
in
the
basket
with
the
rolls
then
she
opened
her
wardrobe
to
look
for
another
treasure
the
old
red
shawl
which
had
been
left
behind
heidi
wrapped
it
round
her
old
hat
and
laid
it
on
the
top
of
the
basket
so
that
the
red
package
was
quite
conspicuous
then
she
put
on
her
pretty
hat
and
left
the
room
miss
rottermeyer
was
waiting
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
say
to
her
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
strange
little
red
bundle
she
took
it
out
of
the
basket
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
no
no
adelaide
she
exclaimed
you
can
not
leave
the
house
with
that
thing
what
can
you
possibly
want
with
it
heidi
did
not
dare
take
up
her
little
bundle
but
she
gave
the
master
of
the
house
an
imploring
look
as
if
her
greatest
treasure
had
been
taken
from
her
no
no
said
sesemann
in
a
very
decided
voice
the
child
shall
take
home
with
her
whatever
she
likes
kittens
and
tortoises
if
it
pleases
her
we
need
not
put
ourselves
out
about
that
miss
rottermeyer
heidi
quickly
picked
up
her
bundle
with
a
look
of
joy
and
gratitude
as
she
stood
by
the
carriage
door
sesemann
gave
her
his
hand
and
said
he
hoped
she
would
remember
him
and
clara
he
wished
her
a
happy
journey
and
heidi
thanked
him
for
all
his
kindness
and
added
and
please
say
to
the
doctor
for
me
and
give
him
many
many
thanks
for
she
had
not
forgotten
that
he
had
said
to
her
the
night
before
will
be
all
right
tomorrow
and
she
rightly
divined
that
he
had
helped
to
make
it
so
for
her
heidi
was
now
lifted
into
the
carriage
and
then
the
basket
and
the
provisions
were
put
in
and
finally
sebastian
took
his
place
then
sesemann
called
out
once
more
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
and
the
carriage
rolled
away
heidi
was
soon
sitting
in
the
railway
carriage
holding
her
basket
tightly
on
her
lap
she
would
not
let
it
out
of
her
hands
for
a
moment
for
it
contained
the
delicious
rolls
for
grandmother
so
she
must
keep
it
carefully
and
even
peep
inside
it
from
time
to
time
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
them
for
many
hours
she
sat
as
still
as
a
mouse
only
now
was
she
beginning
to
realize
that
she
was
going
home
to
the
grandfather
the
mountain
the
grandmother
and
peter
all
of
a
sudden
she
said
anxiously
sebastian
are
you
sure
that
grandmother
on
the
mountain
is
not
dead
no
no
said
sebastian
wishing
to
soothe
her
we
will
hope
not
she
is
sure
to
be
alive
still
then
heidi
fell
back
on
her
own
thoughts
again
now
and
then
she
looked
inside
the
basket
for
the
thing
she
looked
forward
to
most
was
laying
all
the
rolls
out
on
grandmother
table
after
a
long
silence
she
spoke
again
if
only
we
could
know
for
certain
that
grandmother
is
alive
yes
yes
said
sebastian
half
asleep
she
is
sure
to
be
alive
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
be
dead
after
a
while
sleep
came
to
heidi
too
and
after
her
disturbed
night
and
early
rising
she
slept
so
soundly
that
she
did
not
wake
till
sebastian
shook
her
by
the
arm
and
called
to
her
wake
up
wake
up
we
shall
have
to
get
out
directly
we
are
just
in
basle
there
was
a
further
railway
journey
of
many
hours
the
next
day
heidi
again
sat
with
her
basket
on
her
knee
for
she
would
not
have
given
it
up
to
sebastian
on
any
consideration
today
she
never
even
opened
her
mouth
for
her
excitement
which
increased
with
every
mile
of
the
journey
kept
her
speechless
all
of
a
sudden
before
heidi
expected
it
a
voice
called
out
mayenfeld
she
and
sebastian
both
jumped
up
the
latter
also
taken
by
surprise
in
another
minute
they
were
both
standing
on
the
platform
with
heidi
trunk
and
the
train
was
steaming
away
down
the
valley
sebastian
looked
after
it
regretfully
for
he
preferred
the
easier
mode
of
travelling
to
a
wearisome
climb
on
foot
especially
as
there
was
danger
no
doubt
as
well
as
fatigue
in
a
country
like
this
where
according
to
sebastian
idea
everything
and
everybody
were
half
savage
he
therefore
looked
cautiously
to
either
side
to
see
who
was
a
likely
person
to
ask
the
safest
way
to
doerfli
just
outside
the
station
he
saw
a
little
cart
and
horse
which
a
man
was
loading
with
heavy
sacks
that
had
been
brought
by
the
train
so
he
went
up
to
him
and
asked
which
was
the
safest
way
to
get
to
doerfli
all
the
roads
about
here
are
safe
was
the
curt
reply
so
sebastian
altered
his
question
and
asked
which
was
the
best
way
to
avoid
falling
over
the
precipice
and
also
how
a
trunk
could
be
conveyed
to
doerfli
the
man
looked
at
it
weighing
it
with
his
eye
and
then
volunteered
if
it
was
not
too
heavy
to
take
it
on
his
own
cart
as
he
was
driving
to
doerfli
after
some
little
interchange
of
words
it
was
finally
agreed
that
the
man
should
take
both
the
child
and
the
trunk
to
doerfli
and
there
find
some
one
who
could
be
sent
on
with
heidi
up
the
mountain
i
can
go
by
myself
i
know
the
way
well
from
doerfli
put
in
heidi
who
had
been
listening
attentively
to
the
conversation
sebastian
was
greatly
relieved
at
not
having
to
do
any
mountain
climbing
he
drew
heidi
aside
and
gave
her
a
thick
rolled
parcel
and
a
letter
for
her
grandfather
the
parcel
he
told
her
was
a
present
from
sesemann
and
she
must
put
it
at
the
bottom
of
her
basket
under
the
rolls
and
be
very
careful
not
to
lose
it
as
sesemann
would
be
very
vexed
if
she
did
i
shall
be
sure
not
to
lose
it
said
heidi
confidently
and
she
at
once
put
the
roll
and
the
letter
at
the
bottom
of
her
basket
the
trunk
meanwhile
had
been
hoisted
into
the
cart
and
now
sebastian
lifted
heidi
and
her
basket
on
to
the
high
seat
and
shook
hands
with
her
the
driver
swung
himself
up
beside
heidi
and
the
cart
rolled
away
in
the
direction
of
the
mountains
while
sebastian
glad
of
having
no
tiring
and
dangerous
journey
on
foot
before
him
sat
down
in
the
station
and
awaited
the
return
train
the
driver
of
the
cart
was
the
miller
at
doerfli
and
was
taking
home
his
sacks
of
flour
he
had
never
seen
heidi
but
like
everybody
in
doerfli
knew
all
about
her
he
had
known
her
parents
and
felt
sure
at
once
that
this
was
the
child
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
he
began
to
wonder
why
she
had
come
back
and
as
they
drove
along
he
entered
into
conversation
with
her
you
are
the
child
who
lived
with
your
grandfather
are
you
not
yes
did
they
treat
you
well
down
there
that
you
have
come
back
so
soon
yes
it
was
not
that
everything
in
frankfurt
is
as
nice
as
it
could
be
then
why
are
you
running
home
again
only
because
sesemann
gave
me
leave
or
else
i
should
not
have
come
if
they
were
willing
to
let
you
stay
why
did
you
not
remain
where
you
were
better
off
than
at
home
because
i
would
a
thousand
times
rather
be
with
grandfather
on
the
mountain
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
you
will
think
differently
perhaps
when
you
get
back
there
grumbled
the
miller
and
then
to
himself
it
strange
of
her
for
she
must
know
what
it
like
he
began
whistling
and
said
no
more
while
heidi
looked
around
her
and
began
to
tremble
with
excitement
for
she
knew
every
tree
along
the
way
and
there
overhead
were
the
high
jagged
peaks
of
the
mountain
looking
down
on
her
like
old
friends
she
nodded
back
to
them
and
grew
every
moment
more
wild
with
her
joy
and
longing
feeling
as
if
she
must
jump
down
from
the
cart
and
run
with
all
her
might
till
she
reached
the
top
the
clock
was
striking
five
as
they
drove
into
doerfli
as
the
miller
lifted
heidi
down
she
said
hastily
thank
you
grandfather
will
send
for
the
trunk
she
climbed
up
the
steep
path
from
doerfli
as
quickly
as
she
could
she
was
obliged
however
to
pause
now
and
again
to
take
breath
for
the
basket
she
carried
was
rather
heavy
and
the
way
got
steeper
as
she
drew
nearer
the
top
one
thought
alone
filled
heidi
mind
would
she
find
the
grandmother
sitting
in
her
usual
corner
by
the
was
she
still
alive
at
last
heidi
caught
sight
of
the
house
in
the
hollow
of
the
mountain
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
she
ran
faster
and
faster
and
her
heart
beat
louder
and
louder
and
now
she
had
reached
the
house
but
she
trembled
so
she
could
hardly
open
the
door
and
then
she
was
standing
inside
unable
in
her
breathlessness
to
utter
a
sound
ah
my
god
cried
a
voice
from
the
corner
that
was
how
heidi
used
to
run
in
if
only
i
could
have
her
with
me
once
again
who
is
there
it
i
i
grandmother
cried
heidi
as
she
ran
and
flung
herself
on
her
knees
beside
the
old
woman
and
seizing
her
hands
clung
to
her
unable
to
speak
for
joy
and
the
grandmother
herself
could
not
say
a
word
for
some
time
so
unexpected
was
this
happiness
but
at
last
she
put
out
her
hand
and
stroked
heidi
curly
hair
and
said
yes
yes
that
is
her
hair
and
her
voice
thank
god
that
he
has
granted
my
prayer
and
tears
of
joy
fell
from
the
blind
eyes
on
to
heidi
hand
is
it
really
you
heidi
have
you
really
come
back
to
me
yes
grandmother
i
am
really
here
answered
heidi
in
a
reassuring
voice
do
not
cry
for
i
have
really
come
back
and
i
am
never
going
away
again
and
i
shall
come
every
day
to
see
you
and
you
wo
have
any
more
hard
bread
to
eat
for
some
days
for
look
look
and
heidi
took
the
rolls
from
the
basket
and
piled
the
whole
twelve
up
on
grandmother
lap
ah
child
child
what
a
blessing
you
bring
with
you
the
old
woman
exclaimed
as
she
felt
and
seemed
never
to
come
to
the
end
of
the
rolls
but
you
yourself
are
the
greatest
blessing
then
heidi
told
her
how
unhappy
she
had
been
thinking
that
the
grandmother
might
die
while
she
was
away
and
would
never
have
her
white
rolls
and
that
then
she
would
never
never
see
her
again
peter
mother
came
in
and
stood
for
a
moment
overcome
with
astonishment
why
it
heidi
she
exclaimed
heidi
stood
up
and
brigitta
could
not
say
enough
in
her
admiration
of
the
child
dress
and
appearance
she
walked
round
her
exclaiming
all
the
while
grandmother
if
you
could
only
see
her
and
see
what
a
pretty
frock
she
has
on
you
would
hardly
know
her
again
and
the
hat
with
the
feather
in
it
is
yours
too
i
suppose
put
it
on
that
i
may
see
how
you
look
in
it
no
i
would
rather
not
replied
heidi
firmly
you
can
have
it
if
you
like
i
do
not
want
it
i
have
my
own
still
and
heidi
so
saying
undid
her
red
bundle
and
took
out
her
own
hat
which
had
become
a
little
more
battered
still
during
the
journey
she
had
not
forgotten
how
her
grandfather
had
called
out
to
dete
that
he
never
wished
to
see
her
and
her
hat
and
feathers
again
and
this
was
the
reason
she
had
so
anxiously
preserved
her
old
hat
for
she
had
never
ceased
to
think
about
going
home
to
her
grandfather
next
she
took
off
her
pretty
dress
and
put
her
red
shawl
on
over
her
underpetticoat
which
left
her
arms
bare
i
must
go
home
to
grandfather
now
she
said
but
tomorrow
i
shall
come
again
grandmother
yes
come
again
be
sure
you
come
again
tomorrow
begged
the
grandmother
as
she
pressed
heidi
hands
in
hers
unwilling
to
let
her
go
why
have
you
taken
off
that
pretty
dress
asked
brigitta
because
i
would
rather
go
home
to
grandfather
as
i
am
or
else
perhaps
he
would
not
know
me
you
hardly
did
at
first
brigitta
went
with
her
to
the
door
and
there
said
in
rather
a
mysterious
voice
you
must
be
careful
for
peter
tells
me
that
is
always
now
in
a
bad
temper
and
never
speaks
heidi
bid
her
and
continued
her
way
up
the
mountain
her
basket
on
her
arm
soon
she
caught
sight
of
the
tops
of
the
fir
trees
above
the
hut
roof
then
the
roof
itself
and
at
last
the
whole
hut
and
there
was
grandfather
sitting
as
in
old
days
smoking
his
pipe
and
she
could
see
the
fir
trees
waving
in
the
wind
quicker
and
quicker
went
her
little
feet
and
before
had
time
to
see
who
was
coming
heidi
had
rushed
up
to
him
thrown
down
her
basket
and
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
unable
in
the
excitement
of
seeing
him
again
to
say
more
than
grandfather
grandfather
grandfather
over
and
over
again
and
the
old
man
himself
said
nothing
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
his
eyes
were
wet
and
he
had
to
pass
his
hand
across
them
then
he
unloosed
heidi
arms
put
her
on
his
knee
and
after
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
so
you
have
come
back
to
me
heidi
he
said
how
is
that
you
do
look
much
of
a
grand
lady
did
they
send
you
away
oh
no
grandfather
said
heidi
eagerly
you
must
not
think
that
they
were
all
so
kind
clara
and
grandmamma
and
sesemann
but
you
see
grandfather
i
used
to
think
i
should
die
for
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
breathe
but
i
never
said
anything
because
it
would
have
been
ungrateful
and
then
suddenly
one
morning
quite
early
sesemann
said
to
me
but
i
think
it
was
partly
the
doctor
doing
but
perhaps
all
in
the
letter
and
heidi
jumped
down
and
fetched
the
roll
and
the
letter
and
handed
them
both
to
her
grandfather
that
belongs
to
you
he
said
laying
the
roll
of
money
down
on
the
bench
beside
him
then
he
opened
the
letter
read
it
through
and
without
a
word
put
it
in
his
pocket
do
you
think
you
can
still
drink
milk
with
me
heidi
he
asked
taking
the
child
by
the
hand
to
go
into
the
hut
but
bring
your
money
with
you
you
can
buy
a
bed
and
bedclothes
and
dresses
for
a
couple
of
years
with
it
i
am
sure
i
do
not
want
it
replied
heidi
i
have
got
a
bed
already
and
clara
has
put
such
a
lot
of
clothes
in
my
trunk
that
i
shall
never
want
any
more
take
it
and
put
it
in
the
cupboard
you
will
want
it
some
day
i
have
no
doubt
heidi
obeyed
and
skipped
happily
after
her
grandfather
into
the
house
she
ran
into
all
the
corners
delighted
to
see
everything
again
and
then
went
up
the
ladder
but
there
she
came
to
a
pause
and
called
down
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
distress
oh
grandfather
my
bed
gone
we
can
soon
make
it
up
again
he
answered
her
from
below
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
coming
back
come
along
now
and
have
your
milk
illustration
our
milk
tastes
nicer
than
anything
else
in
the
world
grandfather
heidi
came
down
sat
herself
on
her
high
stool
in
the
old
place
and
then
taking
up
her
bowl
drank
her
milk
eagerly
as
if
she
had
never
come
across
anything
so
delicious
and
as
she
put
down
her
bowl
she
exclaimed
our
milk
tastes
nicer
than
anything
else
in
the
world
grandfather
a
shrill
whistle
was
heard
outside
heidi
darted
out
like
a
flash
of
lightning
there
were
the
goats
leaping
and
springing
down
the
rocks
with
peter
in
their
midst
when
he
caught
sight
of
heidi
he
stood
still
with
astonishment
and
gazed
speechlessly
at
her
heidi
called
out
peter
and
then
ran
in
among
the
goats
little
swan
little
bear
do
you
know
me
again
and
the
animals
evidently
recognized
her
voice
at
once
for
they
began
rubbing
their
heads
against
her
and
bleating
loudly
as
if
for
joy
and
as
she
called
the
other
goats
by
name
one
after
the
other
they
all
came
scampering
towards
her
and
crowding
round
her
the
impatient
greenfinch
sprang
into
the
air
and
over
two
of
her
companions
in
order
to
get
nearer
and
even
the
shy
little
snowflake
butted
the
great
turk
out
of
her
way
in
quite
a
determined
manner
which
left
him
standing
taken
aback
by
her
boldness
and
lifting
his
beard
in
the
air
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
who
i
am
so
you
are
back
again
said
peter
at
last
taking
heidi
hand
which
she
was
holding
out
to
him
in
greeting
i
am
glad
you
are
back
he
said
while
his
whole
face
beamed
with
pleasure
and
then
he
prepared
to
go
on
with
his
goats
but
he
never
had
so
much
trouble
with
them
before
for
when
at
last
by
coaxing
and
threats
he
had
got
them
all
together
and
heidi
had
gone
off
with
an
arm
over
either
head
of
her
grandfather
two
goats
the
whole
flock
suddenly
turned
and
ran
after
her
heidi
had
to
go
inside
the
stall
with
her
two
and
shut
the
door
or
peter
would
never
have
got
home
that
night
when
she
went
indoors
after
this
she
found
her
bed
already
made
up
for
her
the
grandfather
had
carefully
spread
and
tucked
in
the
clean
sheets
over
the
fragrant
new
mown
hay
it
was
with
a
happy
heart
that
heidi
lay
down
in
it
that
night
and
her
sleep
was
sounder
than
it
had
been
for
a
whole
year
past
the
grandfather
got
up
at
least
ten
times
during
the
night
and
mounted
the
ladder
to
see
if
heidi
was
all
right
and
showing
no
signs
of
restlessness
and
to
feel
that
the
hay
he
had
stuffed
into
the
round
window
was
keeping
the
moon
from
shining
too
brightly
upon
her
but
heidi
did
not
stir
she
had
no
need
now
to
wander
about
for
the
great
burning
longing
of
her
heart
was
satisfied
she
was
at
home
again
on
the
mountain
chapter
xiv
the
coat
with
the
silver
buttons
the
next
afternoon
heidi
was
standing
under
the
waving
trees
waiting
for
her
grandfather
who
was
going
down
with
her
to
grandmother
and
then
on
to
doerfli
to
fetch
her
trunk
she
was
longing
to
know
how
grandmother
had
enjoyed
her
white
bread
and
impatient
to
see
and
hear
her
again
the
grandfather
came
out
gave
a
look
round
and
then
called
to
her
in
a
cheerful
voice
well
now
we
can
be
off
it
was
saturday
a
day
when
made
everything
clean
and
tidy
inside
and
outside
the
house
he
had
devoted
the
morning
to
this
work
so
as
to
be
able
to
accompany
heidi
in
the
afternoon
and
the
whole
place
was
now
as
spick
and
span
as
he
liked
to
see
it
they
parted
at
the
grandmother
cottage
and
heidi
ran
in
the
grandmother
had
heard
her
steps
approaching
and
greeted
her
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
is
it
you
child
have
you
come
again
then
she
took
hold
of
heidi
hand
and
held
it
fast
in
her
own
for
she
still
seemed
to
fear
that
the
child
might
be
torn
from
her
again
she
told
heidi
how
much
she
had
enjoyed
the
white
bread
and
how
much
stronger
she
felt
already
for
having
been
able
to
eat
it
and
then
peter
mother
went
on
and
said
she
was
sure
that
if
her
mother
could
eat
like
that
for
a
week
she
would
get
back
some
of
her
strength
i
know
grandmother
what
i
will
do
said
heidi
eagerly
i
will
write
to
clara
and
she
will
send
me
as
many
rolls
again
if
not
twice
as
many
as
you
have
already
for
i
had
ever
such
a
large
heap
in
the
wardrobe
and
when
they
were
all
taken
away
she
promised
to
give
me
as
many
back
and
she
would
do
so
i
am
sure
that
is
a
good
idea
said
brigitta
but
then
they
would
get
hard
and
stale
the
baker
in
doerfli
makes
the
white
rolls
and
if
we
could
get
some
of
those
but
i
can
only
just
manage
to
pay
for
the
black
bread
a
further
bright
thought
came
to
heidi
and
with
a
look
of
joy
oh
i
have
lots
of
money
grandmother
she
cried
gleefully
skipping
about
the
room
in
her
delight
and
i
know
now
what
i
will
do
with
it
you
must
have
a
fresh
white
roll
every
day
and
two
on
sunday
and
peter
can
bring
them
up
from
doerfli
no
no
child
answered
the
grandmother
i
can
not
let
you
do
that
the
money
was
not
given
to
you
for
that
purpose
you
must
give
it
to
your
grandfather
and
he
will
tell
you
how
you
are
to
spend
it
but
heidi
was
not
to
be
hindered
in
her
kind
intentions
and
she
continued
to
jump
about
saying
over
and
over
again
in
a
tone
of
exultation
now
grandmother
can
have
a
roll
every
day
and
will
grow
quite
strong
again
and
oh
grandmother
she
suddenly
exclaimed
if
you
get
strong
everything
will
grow
light
again
for
you
perhaps
it
only
because
you
are
weak
that
it
is
dark
the
grandmother
said
nothing
she
did
not
wish
to
spoil
the
child
pleasure
as
she
went
jumping
about
heidi
suddenly
caught
sight
of
the
grandmother
song
book
and
another
happy
idea
struck
her
grandmother
i
can
also
read
now
would
you
like
me
to
read
you
one
of
your
hymns
from
your
old
book
oh
yes
said
the
grandmother
surprised
and
delighted
but
can
you
really
read
child
really
heidi
climbed
on
a
chair
and
lifted
down
the
book
bringing
a
cloud
of
dust
with
it
for
it
had
lain
untouched
on
the
shelf
for
a
long
time
she
wiped
it
off
and
sat
herself
down
on
a
stool
beside
the
old
woman
and
asked
her
which
hymn
she
should
read
what
you
like
child
what
you
like
and
the
grandmother
pushed
her
aside
and
sat
in
eager
expectation
waiting
for
heidi
to
begin
here
is
one
about
the
sun
grandmother
i
will
read
you
that
and
heidi
began
reading
with
more
and
more
warmth
of
expression
as
she
went
on
the
morning
breaks
and
warm
and
bright
the
earth
lies
still
in
the
golden
light
for
dawn
has
scattered
the
clouds
of
night
god
handiwork
is
seen
around
things
great
and
small
to
his
praise
abound
where
are
the
signs
of
his
love
not
found
joy
shall
be
ours
in
that
garden
blest
where
after
storm
we
find
our
rest
i
wait
in
peace
god
time
is
best
the
grandmother
sat
with
folded
hands
and
a
look
of
indescribable
joy
on
her
face
such
as
heidi
had
never
seen
there
before
although
at
the
same
time
the
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
ah
heidi
that
brings
light
to
the
heart
what
comfort
you
have
brought
me
and
the
old
woman
kept
on
repeating
the
glad
words
while
heidi
beamed
with
happiness
some
one
now
knocked
at
the
window
and
heidi
looked
up
and
saw
her
grandfather
beckoning
her
to
come
home
with
him
she
promised
the
grandmother
before
leaving
her
that
she
would
be
with
her
the
next
day
and
even
if
she
went
out
with
peter
she
would
only
spend
half
the
day
with
him
for
the
thought
that
she
might
make
it
light
and
happy
again
for
the
grandmother
gave
her
the
greatest
pleasure
greater
even
than
being
out
on
the
sunny
mountain
with
the
flowers
and
goats
heidi
was
so
full
of
her
morning
doings
that
she
began
at
once
to
tell
her
grandfather
all
about
them
how
the
white
bread
could
be
brought
every
day
from
doerfli
if
there
was
money
for
it
and
how
the
grandmother
had
all
at
once
grown
stronger
and
happier
and
light
had
come
to
her
if
the
grandmother
wo
take
the
money
grandfather
will
you
give
it
all
to
me
and
i
can
then
give
peter
enough
every
day
to
buy
a
roll
and
two
on
sunday
but
how
about
the
bed
said
her
grandfather
it
would
be
nice
for
you
to
have
a
proper
bed
and
there
would
then
be
plenty
for
the
bread
but
heidi
gave
her
grandfather
no
peace
till
he
consented
to
do
what
she
wanted
she
slept
a
great
deal
better
she
said
on
her
bed
of
hay
than
on
her
fine
pillowed
bed
in
frankfurt
so
at
last
he
said
the
money
is
yours
do
what
you
like
with
it
you
can
buy
bread
for
grandmother
for
years
to
come
with
it
heidi
shouted
for
joy
at
the
thought
that
grandmother
would
never
need
to
eat
hard
black
bread
any
more
and
oh
grandfather
she
said
everything
is
happier
now
than
it
has
ever
been
in
our
lives
before
and
she
sang
and
skipped
along
holding
her
grandfather
hand
as
as
a
bird
but
all
at
once
she
grew
quiet
and
said
if
god
had
let
me
come
at
once
as
i
prayed
then
everything
would
have
been
different
i
should
only
have
had
a
little
bread
to
bring
to
grandmother
and
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
read
which
is
such
a
comfort
to
her
so
we
will
pray
every
day
wo
we
grandfather
and
never
forgot
him
again
or
else
he
may
forget
us
and
supposing
one
does
forget
him
said
the
grandfather
in
a
low
voice
then
everything
goes
wrong
for
god
lets
us
then
go
where
we
like
and
when
we
get
poor
and
miserable
and
begin
to
cry
about
it
no
one
pities
us
but
they
say
you
ran
away
from
god
and
so
god
who
could
have
helped
you
left
you
to
yourself
that
is
true
heidi
where
did
you
learn
that
from
grandmamma
sesemann
she
explained
it
all
to
me
the
grandfather
walked
on
for
a
little
while
without
speaking
then
he
said
as
if
following
his
own
train
of
thought
and
if
it
once
is
so
it
is
so
always
no
one
can
go
back
and
he
whom
god
has
forgotten
is
forgotten
for
ever
oh
no
grandfather
we
can
go
back
for
grandmamma
told
me
so
and
so
it
was
in
the
beautiful
tale
in
my
book
but
you
have
not
heard
that
yet
but
we
shall
be
home
directly
now
and
then
i
will
read
it
you
and
you
will
see
how
beautiful
it
is
and
in
her
eagerness
heidi
struggled
faster
and
faster
up
the
steep
ascent
and
they
were
no
sooner
at
the
top
than
she
let
go
her
grandfather
hand
and
ran
into
the
hut
the
grandfather
slung
the
basket
off
his
shoulders
in
which
he
had
brought
up
a
part
of
the
contents
of
the
trunk
which
was
too
heavy
to
carry
up
as
it
was
then
he
sat
down
on
his
seat
and
began
thinking
heidi
soon
came
running
out
with
her
book
under
her
arm
and
in
a
sympathetic
voice
began
to
read
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
is
that
a
beautiful
tale
grandfather
said
heidi
as
the
latter
continued
to
sit
without
speaking
for
she
had
expected
him
to
express
pleasure
and
astonishment
you
are
right
heidi
it
is
a
beautiful
tale
he
replied
but
he
looked
so
grave
as
he
said
it
that
heidi
grew
silent
herself
and
sat
looking
quietly
at
her
pictures
a
few
hours
later
as
she
lay
fast
asleep
in
her
bed
the
grandfather
went
up
the
ladder
and
put
his
lamp
down
near
her
bed
so
that
the
light
fell
on
the
sleeping
child
her
hands
were
still
folded
as
if
she
had
fallen
asleep
saying
her
prayers
an
expression
of
peace
and
trust
lay
on
the
little
face
and
something
in
it
seemed
to
appeal
to
the
grandfather
for
he
stood
a
long
time
gazing
down
at
her
without
speaking
at
last
he
too
folded
his
hands
and
with
bowed
head
said
in
a
low
voice
father
i
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
before
thee
and
am
not
worthy
to
be
called
thy
son
and
two
large
tears
rolled
down
the
old
man
cheeks
next
morning
while
the
sound
of
a
few
early
bells
was
ringing
up
from
the
valley
the
grandfather
called
to
heidi
to
put
on
her
best
frock
for
they
were
going
to
church
together
she
was
not
long
getting
ready
for
it
was
an
unusual
summons
from
her
grandfather
she
put
on
her
smart
frankfurt
dress
and
soon
went
down
but
when
she
saw
her
grandfather
she
stood
still
gazing
at
him
in
astonishment
why
grandfather
she
exclaimed
i
never
saw
you
look
like
that
before
and
the
coat
with
the
silver
buttons
oh
you
do
look
nice
in
your
sunday
coat
the
old
man
smiled
and
replied
and
you
too
now
come
along
he
took
heidi
hand
and
together
they
walked
down
the
mountain
side
the
bells
were
ringing
in
every
direction
now
sounding
louder
and
fuller
as
they
neared
the
valley
and
heidi
listened
to
them
with
delight
hark
grandfather
it
like
a
great
festival
the
congregation
had
already
assembled
and
the
singing
had
begun
when
heidi
and
her
grandfather
entered
the
church
at
doerfli
and
sat
down
at
the
back
but
before
the
hymn
was
over
every
one
was
nudging
his
neighbor
and
whispering
do
you
see
is
in
church
soon
everybody
in
the
church
knew
of
presence
and
the
women
kept
on
turning
round
to
look
and
quite
lost
their
place
in
the
singing
at
the
close
of
the
service
took
heidi
by
the
hand
and
on
leaving
the
church
made
his
way
towards
the
house
the
rest
of
the
congregation
looked
curiously
after
him
some
even
following
to
see
whether
he
went
inside
the
pastor
house
which
he
did
then
they
collected
in
groups
and
talked
over
this
strange
event
keeping
their
eyes
on
the
pastor
door
watching
to
see
whether
came
out
looking
angry
and
quarrelsome
or
as
if
the
interview
had
been
a
peaceful
one
for
they
could
not
imagine
what
had
brought
the
old
man
down
and
what
it
all
meant
some
however
adopted
a
new
tone
and
expressed
their
opinion
that
was
not
so
bad
after
all
as
they
thought
for
see
how
carefully
he
took
the
little
one
by
the
hand
and
others
responded
and
said
they
had
always
thought
people
had
exaggerated
about
him
that
if
he
was
so
downright
bad
he
would
be
afraid
to
go
inside
the
pastor
house
meanwhile
had
gone
into
the
pastor
house
and
knocked
at
the
study
door
the
pastor
came
out
and
shook
hands
warmly
with
him
and
was
unable
at
first
to
speak
for
he
had
not
expected
such
a
friendly
reception
at
last
he
collected
himself
and
said
i
have
come
to
ask
you
pastor
to
forget
the
words
i
spoke
to
you
when
you
called
on
me
and
to
beg
you
not
to
owe
me
for
having
been
so
obstinately
set
against
your
advice
you
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
but
i
have
now
made
up
my
mind
to
follow
your
advice
and
to
find
a
place
for
myself
at
doerfli
for
the
winter
for
the
child
is
not
strong
enough
to
stand
the
bitter
cold
up
on
the
mountain
and
if
the
people
down
here
look
askance
at
me
as
at
a
person
not
to
be
trusted
i
know
it
is
my
own
fault
the
pastor
kindly
eyes
shone
with
pleasure
he
pressed
the
old
man
hand
in
his
and
said
with
emotion
neighbor
i
am
greatly
rejoiced
you
will
not
repent
coming
to
live
with
us
again
as
for
myself
you
will
always
be
welcome
as
a
dear
friend
and
neighbor
and
i
look
forward
to
our
spending
many
a
pleasant
winter
evening
together
and
we
will
find
some
nice
friends
too
for
the
little
one
and
the
pastor
laid
his
hand
kindly
on
the
child
curly
head
and
took
her
by
the
hand
as
he
walked
to
the
door
with
the
old
man
he
did
not
say
to
him
till
they
were
standing
outside
so
that
all
the
people
loitering
about
saw
him
shake
hands
as
if
parting
reluctantly
from
his
best
friend
the
door
had
hardly
shut
behind
him
before
the
whole
congregation
now
came
forward
to
greet
every
one
striving
to
be
the
first
to
shake
hands
with
him
most
of
his
friends
accompanied
him
and
heidi
some
way
up
the
mountain
and
each
as
they
bid
him
made
him
promise
that
when
he
next
came
down
he
would
without
fail
come
and
call
as
the
old
man
at
last
stood
alone
with
the
child
watching
their
retreating
figures
there
was
a
light
upon
his
face
as
if
reflected
from
some
inner
sunshine
of
heart
heidi
looking
up
at
him
with
her
clear
steady
eyes
said
grandfather
you
look
nicer
and
nicer
today
i
never
saw
you
quite
like
that
before
do
you
think
so
he
answered
with
a
smile
well
yes
heidi
i
am
happier
today
than
i
deserve
happier
than
i
had
thought
possible
it
is
good
to
be
at
peace
with
god
and
man
god
was
good
to
me
when
he
sent
you
to
my
hut
when
they
reached
peter
home
the
grandfather
opened
the
door
and
walked
straight
in
grandmother
he
said
i
think
we
shall
have
to
do
some
more
patching
up
before
the
autumn
winds
come
well
if
it
is
not
uncle
cried
the
grandmother
in
pleased
surprise
that
i
should
live
to
see
such
a
thing
and
now
i
can
thank
you
for
all
that
you
have
done
for
me
may
god
reward
you
may
god
reward
you
she
stretched
out
a
trembling
hand
to
him
and
the
grandfather
shook
it
warmly
at
this
moment
peter
rushed
in
evidently
in
a
great
hurry
knocking
his
head
violently
against
the
door
in
his
haste
so
that
everything
in
the
room
rattled
gasping
and
breathless
he
stood
still
after
this
and
held
out
a
letter
this
was
another
great
event
for
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
before
the
letter
was
addressed
to
heidi
and
had
been
delivered
at
the
in
doerfli
they
all
sat
down
round
the
table
to
hear
what
was
in
it
for
heidi
opened
it
at
once
and
read
it
without
hesitation
the
letter
was
from
clara
who
wrote
that
the
house
had
been
so
dull
since
heidi
left
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
she
had
at
last
persuaded
her
father
to
take
her
to
the
baths
at
ragatz
in
the
coming
autumn
grandmamma
had
arranged
to
join
them
there
and
they
both
were
looking
forward
to
paying
her
and
her
grandfather
a
visit
and
grandmamma
sent
a
further
message
to
heidi
which
was
that
the
latter
had
done
quite
right
to
take
the
rolls
to
the
grandmother
and
so
that
she
might
not
have
to
eat
them
dry
she
was
sending
some
coffee
which
was
already
on
its
way
and
grandmamma
hoped
when
she
came
to
the
alm
in
the
autumn
that
heidi
would
take
her
to
see
her
old
friend
there
were
exclamations
of
pleasure
and
astonishment
on
hearing
this
news
and
the
afternoon
soon
passed
in
discussing
plans
for
the
coming
visit
then
the
old
man
and
heidi
started
back
up
the
mountain
promising
the
grandmother
that
they
would
come
again
next
day
as
they
had
been
greeted
with
the
bells
when
they
made
their
journey
down
in
the
morning
so
now
they
were
accompanied
by
the
peaceful
evening
chimes
as
they
climbed
to
the
hut
which
had
quite
a
appearance
as
it
stood
bathed
in
the
light
of
the
low
evening
sun
chapter
xv
a
great
disappointment
when
autumn
came
clara
was
not
so
well
and
the
doctor
advised
sesemann
to
postpone
the
visit
to
heidi
till
the
following
spring
i
know
how
you
hate
to
deny
your
child
anything
and
especially
this
trip
that
she
has
so
set
her
heart
upon
said
the
old
doctor
but
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
it
sesemann
clara
has
not
had
such
a
bad
summer
as
this
last
one
for
years
only
the
worst
results
would
follow
from
the
fatigue
of
such
a
journey
and
it
is
out
of
the
question
for
her
if
we
want
to
give
the
child
a
chance
of
recovery
we
must
use
the
utmost
care
and
watchfulness
sesemann
who
had
listened
to
the
doctor
in
sad
and
submissive
silence
now
suddenly
jumped
up
doctor
he
said
tell
me
truly
have
you
really
any
hope
for
her
final
recovery
the
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
very
little
he
replied
quietly
but
friend
think
of
my
trouble
you
still
have
a
beloved
child
to
look
for
you
and
greet
you
on
your
return
home
you
do
not
come
back
to
an
empty
house
and
sit
down
to
a
solitary
meal
the
once
bright
and
cheery
doctor
was
now
a
man
he
could
not
get
over
the
loss
of
his
daughter
who
had
died
some
months
before
and
who
had
been
his
sole
and
constant
companion
for
many
years
sesemann
who
had
been
striding
up
and
down
the
room
suddenly
paused
beside
his
friend
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
said
doctor
i
have
an
idea
how
would
it
be
for
you
to
go
and
pay
heidi
a
visit
in
our
name
you
need
a
change
of
scene
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
so
sad
you
are
no
longer
the
same
man
the
doctor
was
taken
aback
at
this
sudden
proposal
and
wanted
to
make
objections
but
his
friend
gave
him
no
time
to
say
anything
he
was
so
delighted
with
his
idea
that
he
seized
the
doctor
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
into
clara
room
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
as
he
came
up
to
her
he
took
a
seat
beside
her
and
her
father
also
drew
up
his
chair
and
taking
clara
hand
in
his
began
to
talk
to
her
of
the
swiss
journey
and
how
he
himself
had
looked
forward
to
it
he
passed
as
quickly
as
he
could
over
the
main
point
that
it
was
now
impossible
for
her
to
undertake
it
for
he
dreaded
the
tears
that
would
follow
but
he
went
on
without
pause
to
tell
her
of
his
new
plan
and
dwelt
on
the
great
benefit
it
would
be
to
his
friend
if
he
could
be
persuaded
to
take
this
holiday
the
tears
were
indeed
swimming
in
the
blue
eyes
although
clara
struggled
to
keep
them
down
for
her
father
sake
but
it
was
a
bitter
disappointment
to
give
up
the
journey
the
thought
of
which
had
been
her
only
joy
and
solace
during
the
lonely
hours
of
her
long
illness
she
knew
however
that
her
father
would
never
refuse
her
a
thing
unless
he
was
certain
that
it
would
be
harmful
for
her
so
she
swallowed
her
tears
as
well
as
she
could
and
turned
her
thoughts
to
the
one
hope
still
left
her
taking
the
doctor
hand
and
stroking
it
she
said
pleadingly
dear
doctor
you
will
go
and
see
heidi
wo
you
and
then
you
can
come
and
tell
me
all
about
it
what
it
is
like
up
there
and
what
heidi
and
the
grandfather
and
peter
and
the
goats
do
all
day
i
know
them
all
so
well
and
then
you
can
take
what
i
want
to
send
to
heidi
i
have
thought
about
it
all
and
also
something
for
the
grandmother
do
pray
go
dear
doctor
and
i
will
take
as
much
cod
liver
oil
as
you
like
whether
this
promise
finally
decided
the
doctor
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
it
is
certain
that
he
smiled
and
said
then
i
must
certainly
go
clara
for
you
will
then
get
as
plump
and
strong
as
your
father
and
i
wish
to
see
you
and
have
you
decided
when
i
am
to
start
tomorrow
morning
early
if
possible
replied
clara
yes
she
is
right
put
in
sesemann
the
sun
is
shining
and
the
sky
is
blue
and
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
it
is
a
pity
to
miss
a
single
one
of
these
days
on
the
mountain
the
doctor
could
not
help
laughing
you
will
be
reproaching
me
next
for
not
being
there
already
well
i
must
go
and
make
arrangements
for
getting
off
but
clara
would
not
let
him
go
until
she
had
given
him
endless
messages
for
heidi
and
had
explained
all
he
was
to
look
at
so
as
to
give
her
an
exact
description
on
his
return
she
would
pack
the
presents
she
had
already
bought
and
send
them
to
his
house
later
the
doctor
promised
to
obey
clara
directions
in
every
particular
he
would
start
some
time
during
the
following
day
if
not
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
would
bring
back
a
faithful
account
of
his
experiences
and
of
all
he
saw
and
heard
he
was
hastening
off
when
he
met
miss
rottermeyer
just
returning
from
a
walk
he
informed
her
of
his
intended
journey
begging
her
in
his
most
conciliatory
voice
to
pack
up
the
parcels
for
heidi
as
she
alone
knew
how
to
pack
and
then
he
took
his
leave
clara
quite
expected
to
have
a
long
tussle
with
miss
rottermeyer
before
she
would
get
the
latter
to
consent
to
sending
all
the
things
that
she
had
collected
as
presents
for
heidi
but
this
time
she
was
mistaken
for
miss
rottermeyer
was
in
a
more
than
usually
good
temper
she
cleared
the
large
table
so
that
all
the
things
for
heidi
could
be
spread
out
upon
it
and
packed
under
clara
own
eyes
it
was
no
light
job
for
the
presents
were
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
first
there
was
the
little
warm
cloak
with
a
hood
which
had
been
designed
by
clara
herself
in
order
that
heidi
during
the
coming
winter
might
be
able
to
go
and
see
grandmother
when
she
liked
and
not
have
to
wait
till
her
grandfather
could
take
her
wrapped
up
in
a
sack
to
keep
her
from
freezing
then
came
a
thick
warm
shawl
for
the
grandmother
in
which
she
could
wrap
herself
well
up
and
not
feel
the
cold
when
the
wind
came
sweeping
in
such
terrible
gusts
round
the
house
the
next
object
was
the
large
box
full
of
cakes
these
were
also
for
the
grandmother
that
she
might
have
something
to
eat
with
her
coffee
besides
bread
an
immense
sausage
was
the
next
article
this
had
been
originally
intended
for
peter
who
never
had
anything
but
bread
and
cheese
but
clara
had
altered
her
mind
fearing
that
in
his
delight
he
might
eat
it
all
up
at
once
and
make
himself
ill
so
she
arranged
to
send
it
to
brigitta
who
could
take
some
for
herself
and
the
grandmother
and
give
peter
his
portion
out
by
degrees
a
packet
of
tobacco
was
a
present
for
grandfather
who
was
so
fond
of
his
pipe
as
he
sat
resting
in
the
evening
finally
there
was
a
whole
lot
of
mysterious
little
bags
and
parcels
and
boxes
which
clara
had
had
especial
pleasure
in
collecting
as
each
was
to
be
a
joyful
surprise
for
heidi
as
she
opened
it
the
work
came
to
an
end
at
last
and
clara
eyed
the
big
box
with
pleasure
picturing
heidi
exclamations
and
jumps
of
joy
and
surprise
when
the
huge
parcel
arrived
at
the
hut
illustration
sebastian
came
in
and
lifting
the
package
on
to
his
shoulder
carried
it
off
to
be
forwarded
at
once
to
the
doctor
house
chapter
xvi
the
doctor
comes
with
presents
the
early
light
of
morning
lay
rosy
red
upon
the
mountains
and
a
fresh
breeze
rustled
through
the
fir
trees
and
set
their
ancient
branches
waving
to
and
fro
the
sound
awoke
heidi
and
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
dressed
herself
as
quickly
as
she
could
when
she
went
down
her
ladder
she
found
her
grandfather
had
already
left
the
hut
he
was
standing
outside
looking
at
the
sky
and
examining
the
landscape
as
he
did
every
morning
to
see
what
sort
of
weather
it
was
going
to
be
little
pink
clouds
were
floating
over
the
sky
that
was
growing
brighter
and
bluer
with
every
minute
while
the
heights
and
the
meadow
lands
were
turning
gold
under
the
rising
sun
which
was
just
appearing
above
the
topmost
peaks
o
how
beautiful
how
beautiful
grandfather
cried
heidi
running
out
what
you
are
awake
already
are
you
he
answered
giving
her
a
morning
greeting
then
heidi
ran
round
to
the
fir
trees
to
enjoy
the
sound
she
loved
so
well
and
with
every
fresh
gust
of
wind
which
came
roaring
through
their
branches
she
gave
a
fresh
jump
and
cry
of
delight
meanwhile
the
grandfather
had
gone
to
milk
the
goats
this
done
he
brushed
and
washed
them
ready
for
their
mountain
excursion
and
brought
them
out
of
their
shed
as
soon
as
heidi
caught
sight
of
them
she
ran
and
embraced
them
and
they
bleated
in
return
while
they
vied
with
each
other
in
showing
their
affection
by
poking
their
heads
against
her
and
trying
which
could
get
nearest
her
when
the
lively
little
bear
gave
rather
too
violent
a
thrust
she
only
said
no
little
bear
you
are
pushing
like
the
great
turk
and
little
bear
immediately
drew
back
his
head
and
left
off
his
rough
attentions
while
little
swan
lifted
her
head
and
put
on
an
expression
as
much
as
to
say
no
one
shall
ever
accuse
me
of
behaving
like
the
great
turk
peter
whistle
was
heard
and
all
the
goats
came
along
leaping
and
springing
and
heidi
soon
found
herself
surrounded
by
the
whole
flock
pushed
this
way
and
that
by
their
obstreperous
greetings
but
at
last
she
managed
to
get
through
them
to
where
snowflake
was
standing
for
the
young
goat
had
in
vain
striven
to
reach
her
peter
now
gave
a
last
tremendous
whistle
in
order
to
startle
the
goats
and
drive
them
off
for
he
wanted
to
get
near
himself
to
say
something
to
heidi
the
goats
sprang
aside
and
he
came
up
to
her
can
you
come
out
with
me
today
he
asked
evidently
unwilling
to
hear
her
refuse
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
peter
she
answered
i
am
expecting
them
every
minute
from
frankfurt
and
i
must
be
at
home
when
they
come
you
have
said
the
same
thing
for
days
now
grumbled
peter
i
must
continue
to
say
it
till
they
come
replied
heidi
how
can
you
think
peter
that
i
would
be
away
when
they
came
as
if
i
could
do
such
a
thing
they
would
find
uncle
at
home
he
answered
with
a
snarling
voice
but
at
this
moment
the
grandfather
stentorian
voice
was
heard
why
is
the
army
not
marching
forward
is
it
the
who
is
missing
or
some
of
the
troops
whereupon
peter
turned
and
went
off
swinging
his
stick
round
so
that
it
whistled
through
the
air
and
the
goats
who
understood
the
signal
started
at
full
trot
for
their
mountain
pasture
peter
following
in
their
wake
since
heidi
had
come
back
to
her
grandfather
she
had
learned
to
do
many
things
about
the
house
she
put
her
bed
in
order
every
morning
patting
and
stroking
it
till
she
had
got
it
perfectly
smooth
and
flat
then
she
went
about
the
room
downstairs
put
each
chair
back
in
its
place
and
if
she
found
anything
lying
about
she
put
it
in
the
cupboard
after
that
she
fetched
a
duster
climbed
on
a
chair
and
rubbed
the
table
till
it
shone
again
when
the
grandfather
came
in
later
he
would
look
round
well
pleased
and
say
to
himself
we
look
like
sunday
every
day
now
heidi
did
not
go
abroad
for
nothing
after
peter
had
departed
and
she
and
her
grandfather
had
breakfasted
heidi
began
her
daily
work
as
usual
but
she
did
not
get
on
with
it
very
fast
it
was
so
lovely
out
of
doors
today
and
every
minute
something
happened
to
interrupt
her
in
her
work
now
it
was
a
bright
beam
of
sun
shining
cheerfully
through
the
open
window
and
seeming
to
say
come
out
heidi
come
out
heidi
felt
she
could
not
stay
indoors
and
she
ran
out
in
answer
to
the
call
the
sunlight
lay
sparkling
on
everything
around
the
hut
and
on
all
the
mountains
and
far
away
along
the
valley
and
the
grass
slope
looked
so
golden
and
inviting
that
she
was
obliged
to
sit
down
for
a
few
minutes
and
look
about
her
then
she
suddenly
remembered
that
her
stool
was
left
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
that
the
table
had
not
been
rubbed
and
she
jumped
up
and
ran
inside
again
but
it
was
not
long
before
the
fir
trees
began
their
old
song
heidi
felt
it
in
all
her
limbs
and
again
the
desire
to
run
outside
was
irresistible
and
she
was
off
to
play
and
leap
to
the
tune
of
the
waving
branches
the
grandfather
who
was
busy
in
his
stepped
out
from
time
to
time
smiling
to
watch
her
at
her
gambols
he
had
just
gone
back
to
his
work
on
one
of
these
occasions
when
heidi
called
out
grandfather
grandfather
come
come
he
stepped
quickly
out
almost
afraid
something
had
happened
to
the
child
but
he
saw
her
running
towards
where
the
mountain
path
descended
crying
they
are
coming
they
are
coming
and
the
doctor
is
in
front
of
them
heidi
rushed
forward
to
welcome
her
old
friend
who
held
out
his
hands
in
greeting
to
her
when
she
came
up
to
him
she
clung
to
his
outstretched
arm
and
exclaimed
in
the
joy
of
her
heart
doctor
and
thank
you
ever
so
many
times
god
bless
you
child
what
have
you
got
to
thank
me
for
asked
the
doctor
smiling
for
being
at
home
again
with
grandfather
the
child
explained
the
doctor
face
brightened
as
if
a
sudden
ray
of
sunshine
had
passed
across
it
he
had
not
expected
such
a
reception
as
this
he
had
quite
thought
that
heidi
would
have
forgotten
him
she
had
seen
so
little
of
him
and
he
had
felt
rather
like
one
bearing
a
message
of
disappointment
but
instead
here
was
heidi
her
eyes
dancing
for
joy
and
full
of
gratitude
and
affection
clinging
to
the
arm
of
her
kind
friend
he
took
her
by
the
hand
with
fatherly
tenderness
take
me
now
to
your
grandfather
heidi
and
show
me
where
you
live
but
heidi
still
remained
standing
looking
down
the
path
with
a
questioning
gaze
where
are
clara
and
grandmother
she
asked
ah
now
i
have
to
tell
you
something
which
you
will
be
as
sorry
about
as
i
am
answered
the
doctor
you
see
heidi
i
have
come
alone
clara
was
very
ill
and
could
not
travel
and
so
the
grandmother
stayed
behind
too
but
next
spring
when
the
days
grow
warm
and
long
again
they
are
coming
here
for
certain
heidi
stood
motionless
for
a
second
or
two
overcome
by
the
unexpected
disappointment
she
suddenly
remembered
that
the
doctor
had
really
come
anyway
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
saw
the
sad
expression
in
his
as
he
looked
down
at
her
she
had
never
seen
him
with
that
look
on
his
face
when
she
was
in
frankfurt
it
went
to
heidi
heart
she
could
not
bear
to
see
anybody
unhappy
especially
her
dear
doctor
no
doubt
it
was
because
clara
and
grandmother
could
not
come
and
so
she
began
to
think
how
best
she
might
console
him
oh
it
wo
be
very
long
to
wait
for
spring
and
then
they
will
be
sure
to
come
she
said
in
a
reassuring
voice
time
passes
very
quickly
with
us
and
then
they
will
be
able
to
stay
longer
when
they
are
here
and
clara
will
be
pleased
at
that
now
let
us
go
and
find
grandfather
hand
in
hand
with
her
friend
she
climbed
up
to
the
hut
she
was
so
anxious
to
make
the
doctor
happy
again
that
she
began
once
more
assuring
him
that
the
winter
passed
quickly
on
the
mountain
and
that
summer
would
be
back
again
before
they
knew
it
and
she
became
so
convinced
of
the
truth
of
her
own
words
that
she
called
out
quite
cheerfully
to
her
grandfather
as
they
approached
they
have
not
come
today
but
they
will
be
here
in
a
very
short
time
illustration
it
was
not
long
before
the
fir
trees
began
their
old
song
the
doctor
was
no
stranger
to
the
grandfather
for
the
child
had
talked
to
him
so
much
about
her
friend
the
old
man
held
out
his
hand
to
his
guest
in
friendly
greeting
then
the
two
men
sat
down
in
front
of
the
hut
the
doctor
whispered
to
heidi
that
there
was
something
being
brought
up
the
mountain
which
had
traveled
with
him
from
frankfurt
and
which
would
give
her
even
more
pleasure
than
seeing
him
heidi
got
into
a
great
state
of
excitement
on
hearing
this
wondering
what
it
could
be
the
old
man
urged
the
doctor
to
spend
as
many
of
the
beautiful
autumn
days
on
the
mountain
as
he
could
and
at
least
to
come
up
whenever
it
was
fine
he
could
not
offer
him
a
lodging
as
he
had
no
place
to
put
him
he
advised
the
doctor
however
not
to
go
back
to
ragatz
but
to
stay
at
doerfli
where
there
was
a
clean
tidy
little
inn
then
the
doctor
could
come
up
every
morning
which
would
do
him
no
end
of
good
and
if
he
liked
he
the
grandfather
would
act
as
his
guide
to
any
part
of
the
mountains
he
would
like
to
see
the
doctor
was
delighted
with
this
proposal
and
it
was
settled
that
it
should
be
as
the
grandfather
suggested
now
rose
and
went
indoors
returning
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
table
which
he
placed
in
front
of
the
seat
there
heidi
now
run
in
and
bring
us
what
we
want
for
the
table
he
said
the
doctor
must
take
us
as
he
finds
us
if
the
food
is
plain
he
will
acknowledge
that
the
is
pleasant
i
should
think
so
indeed
replied
the
doctor
as
he
looked
down
over
the
valley
and
i
accept
the
kind
invitation
everything
must
taste
good
up
here
heidi
ran
backwards
and
forwards
as
busy
as
a
bee
and
brought
out
everything
she
could
find
in
the
cupboard
the
grandfather
meanwhile
had
been
preparing
the
meal
and
now
appeared
with
a
steaming
jug
of
milk
and
toasted
cheese
then
he
cut
some
thin
slices
from
the
meat
he
had
cured
himself
in
the
pure
air
and
the
doctor
enjoyed
his
dinner
better
than
he
had
for
a
whole
year
past
our
clara
must
certainly
come
up
here
he
said
it
would
make
her
quite
a
different
person
and
if
she
could
eat
for
any
length
of
time
as
i
have
today
she
would
grow
plumper
than
any
one
has
ever
known
her
before
as
he
spoke
a
man
was
seen
coming
up
the
path
carrying
a
large
package
on
his
back
when
he
reached
the
hut
he
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
drew
in
two
or
three
good
breaths
of
the
mountain
air
ah
here
what
travelled
with
me
from
frankfurt
said
the
doctor
rising
and
he
went
up
to
the
package
and
began
undoing
it
heidi
looking
on
in
great
expectation
after
he
had
released
it
from
its
heavy
outer
covering
there
child
he
said
now
you
can
go
on
unpacking
your
treasures
yourself
heidi
undid
her
presents
one
by
one
until
they
were
all
displayed
she
could
not
speak
for
wonder
and
delight
not
till
the
doctor
opened
the
large
box
to
show
heidi
the
cakes
that
were
for
the
grandmother
to
eat
with
her
coffee
did
she
at
last
give
a
cry
of
joy
exclaiming
now
grandmother
will
have
nice
things
to
eat
and
she
wanted
to
pack
everything
up
again
and
start
at
once
to
give
them
to
her
but
the
grandfather
said
he
should
walk
down
with
the
doctor
that
evening
and
she
could
go
with
them
and
take
the
things
heidi
next
found
the
packet
of
tobacco
which
she
ran
and
gave
to
her
grandfather
he
was
so
pleased
with
it
that
he
immediately
filled
his
pipe
with
some
and
the
two
men
then
sat
down
together
again
the
smoke
curling
up
from
their
pipes
as
they
talked
of
all
kinds
of
things
while
heidi
continued
to
examine
first
one
and
then
another
of
her
presents
suddenly
she
ran
up
to
them
and
standing
in
front
of
the
doctor
waited
till
there
was
a
pause
in
the
conversation
and
then
said
no
the
presents
have
not
given
me
more
pleasure
than
seeing
you
doctor
the
two
men
could
not
help
laughing
and
the
doctor
answered
that
he
should
never
have
thought
it
as
the
sun
began
to
sink
behind
the
mountains
the
doctor
rose
thinking
it
time
to
return
to
doerfli
and
seek
for
quarters
the
grandfather
carried
the
cakes
and
the
shawl
and
the
large
sausage
and
the
doctor
took
heidi
hand
as
they
all
three
started
down
the
mountain
arrived
at
peter
home
heidi
bid
the
others
she
was
to
wait
at
grandmother
till
her
grandfather
who
was
going
on
to
doerfli
with
his
guest
returned
for
her
as
the
doctor
shook
hands
with
her
she
asked
would
you
like
to
come
out
with
the
goats
tomorrow
morning
for
she
could
think
of
no
greater
treat
to
offer
him
agreed
answered
the
doctor
we
will
go
together
heidi
now
ran
in
to
the
grandmother
she
first
with
some
effort
managed
to
carry
in
the
box
of
cakes
then
she
ran
out
again
and
brought
in
the
sausage
for
her
grandfather
had
put
the
presents
down
by
the
door
and
then
a
third
time
for
the
shawl
she
placed
them
as
close
as
she
could
to
the
grandmother
so
that
the
latter
might
be
able
to
feel
them
and
understand
what
was
there
the
shawl
she
laid
over
the
old
woman
knees
they
are
all
from
frankfurt
from
clara
and
grandmamma
she
explained
to
the
astonished
grandmother
and
brigitta
the
latter
having
watched
her
dragging
in
all
the
heavy
things
unable
to
imagine
what
was
happening
and
you
are
very
pleased
with
the
cakes
are
you
grandmother
taste
how
soft
they
are
said
heidi
over
and
over
again
to
which
the
grandmother
continued
to
answer
yes
yes
heidi
i
should
think
so
what
kind
people
they
must
be
and
then
she
would
pass
her
hand
over
the
warm
thick
shawl
and
add
this
will
be
beautiful
for
the
cold
winter
i
never
thought
i
should
ever
have
such
a
splendid
thing
as
this
to
put
on
heidi
could
not
help
feeling
some
surprise
at
the
grandmother
seeming
to
take
more
pleasure
in
the
shawl
than
the
cakes
meanwhile
brigitta
stood
gazing
at
the
sausage
with
almost
an
expression
of
awe
she
had
hardly
in
her
life
seen
such
a
monster
sausage
much
less
owned
one
and
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
peter
came
tumbling
in
at
this
minute
uncle
is
just
behind
me
he
is
coming
he
began
and
then
stopped
short
for
his
eye
had
caught
sight
of
the
sausage
and
he
was
too
much
taken
aback
to
say
more
but
heidi
understood
that
her
grandfather
was
near
and
so
said
to
grandmother
the
old
man
now
never
passed
the
door
without
going
in
to
wish
the
old
woman
and
she
liked
to
hear
his
footstep
approaching
for
he
always
had
a
cheery
word
for
her
but
today
it
was
growing
late
for
heidi
who
was
always
up
with
the
lark
and
the
grandfather
would
never
let
her
go
to
bed
after
hours
so
this
evening
he
only
called
through
the
open
door
and
started
home
at
once
with
the
child
and
the
two
climbed
under
the
starlit
sky
back
to
their
peaceful
dwelling
chapter
xvii
excursions
over
the
mountains
the
next
morning
the
doctor
climbed
up
from
doerfli
with
peter
and
the
goats
at
the
hut
they
found
heidi
awaiting
them
with
her
two
goats
all
three
as
fresh
and
lively
as
the
morning
sun
among
the
mountains
are
you
coming
today
said
peter
repeating
the
words
with
which
he
daily
greeted
her
of
course
i
am
if
the
doctor
is
coming
too
replied
heidi
peter
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
doctor
the
grandfather
now
came
out
with
the
dinner
bag
and
after
bidding
to
the
doctor
he
went
up
to
peter
and
slung
it
over
his
neck
it
was
heavier
than
usual
for
had
added
some
meat
today
as
he
thought
the
doctor
might
like
to
have
his
lunch
out
of
doors
with
the
children
peter
gave
a
grin
for
he
felt
sure
there
was
something
extra
good
in
it
and
so
the
ascent
began
the
goats
as
usual
came
thronging
round
heidi
each
trying
to
be
nearest
her
until
at
last
she
stood
still
and
said
now
you
must
go
on
in
front
and
behave
properly
and
not
keep
on
turning
back
and
pushing
and
poking
me
for
i
want
to
talk
to
the
doctor
by
degrees
she
managed
to
make
her
way
out
from
among
them
and
joined
the
doctor
who
took
her
by
the
hand
heidi
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
the
goats
and
their
peculiarities
and
about
the
flowers
and
the
rocks
and
the
birds
and
so
they
clambered
on
and
reached
their
before
they
were
aware
peter
had
sent
a
good
many
unfriendly
glances
towards
the
doctor
on
the
way
up
which
might
have
quite
alarmed
the
latter
if
he
had
happened
to
notice
them
which
fortunately
he
did
not
heidi
led
her
friend
to
her
favorite
spot
where
she
was
accustomed
to
sit
and
enjoy
the
beauty
around
her
the
doctor
followed
her
example
and
took
his
seat
beside
her
on
the
warm
grass
the
great
snowfield
sparkled
in
the
bright
sunlight
on
the
rocky
peaks
a
soft
light
morning
breeze
blew
deliciously
across
the
mountain
gently
stirring
the
bluebells
that
still
remained
of
the
summer
wealth
of
flowers
their
slender
heads
nodding
cheerfully
in
the
sunshine
overhead
the
great
bird
was
flying
round
and
round
in
wide
circles
heidi
looked
about
her
first
at
one
thing
and
then
at
another
her
eyes
were
alight
with
joy
she
turned
to
her
friend
to
see
if
he
too
were
enjoying
the
beauty
the
doctor
had
been
sitting
thoughtfully
gazing
around
him
as
he
met
her
glad
bright
eyes
yes
heidi
he
responded
i
see
how
lovely
it
all
is
but
tell
me
if
one
brings
a
sad
heart
up
here
how
may
it
be
healed
so
that
it
can
rejoice
in
all
this
beauty
but
no
one
is
sad
up
here
only
in
frankfurt
exclaimed
heidi
the
doctor
smiled
and
then
growing
serious
again
he
continued
but
supposing
one
is
not
able
to
leave
all
the
sadness
behind
at
frankfurt
can
you
tell
me
anything
that
will
help
then
when
you
do
not
know
what
more
to
do
you
must
go
and
tell
everything
to
god
answered
heidi
with
decision
ah
that
is
a
good
thought
of
yours
heidi
said
the
doctor
but
if
it
is
god
himself
who
has
sent
the
trouble
what
can
we
say
to
him
then
heidi
sat
pondering
for
a
while
she
was
sure
in
her
heart
that
god
could
help
out
of
every
trouble
she
thought
over
her
own
experiences
and
then
found
her
answer
then
you
must
wait
she
said
and
keep
on
saying
to
yourself
god
certainly
knows
of
some
happiness
for
us
which
he
is
going
to
bring
out
of
the
trouble
only
we
must
have
patience
and
not
run
away
that
is
a
beautiful
faith
child
and
be
sure
you
hold
it
fast
replied
the
doctor
but
can
you
understand
heidi
that
a
man
may
sit
here
with
such
a
shadow
over
his
eyes
that
he
can
not
feel
and
enjoy
the
beauty
around
him
while
the
heart
grows
doubly
sad
knowing
how
beautiful
it
could
be
can
you
understand
that
a
pain
shot
through
the
child
young
happy
heart
the
shadow
over
the
eyes
brought
to
her
remembrance
the
grandmother
who
would
never
again
be
able
to
see
the
sunlight
and
the
beauty
up
here
this
was
great
sorrow
which
reawoke
each
time
she
thought
about
the
darkness
yes
i
can
understand
it
and
i
know
this
that
then
one
must
say
one
of
grandmother
hymns
which
bring
the
light
back
a
little
and
often
make
it
so
bright
for
her
that
she
is
quite
happy
again
grandmother
herself
told
me
this
which
hymns
are
they
heidi
asked
the
doctor
i
only
know
the
one
about
the
sun
and
the
beautiful
garden
and
some
of
the
verses
of
the
long
one
which
are
favorites
with
her
and
she
always
likes
me
to
read
them
to
her
two
or
three
times
over
replied
heidi
well
say
the
verses
to
me
then
i
should
like
to
hear
them
too
said
the
doctor
heidi
collected
her
thoughts
for
a
second
or
two
and
began
let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
nor
fear
your
soul
dismay
there
is
a
wise
defender
and
he
will
be
your
stay
where
you
have
failed
he
conquers
see
how
the
foeman
flies
and
all
your
tribulation
is
turned
to
glad
surprise
if
for
a
while
it
seemeth
his
mercy
is
withdrawn
that
he
no
longer
careth
for
his
wandering
child
forlorn
doubt
not
his
great
compassion
his
love
can
never
tire
to
those
who
wait
in
patience
he
gives
their
heart
desire
suddenly
she
paused
she
was
not
sure
if
the
doctor
was
still
listening
he
was
sitting
motionless
with
his
hand
before
his
eyes
his
thoughts
had
carried
him
back
to
a
long
past
time
he
saw
himself
as
a
little
boy
standing
by
his
dear
mother
chair
she
had
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
was
saying
the
very
verses
to
him
that
heidi
had
just
recited
words
which
he
had
not
heard
now
for
years
he
could
hear
his
mother
voice
and
see
her
loving
eyes
resting
upon
him
and
as
heidi
ceased
the
old
dear
voice
seemed
to
be
saying
other
things
to
him
and
the
words
he
heard
again
must
have
carried
him
far
far
away
for
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
stirred
or
took
his
hand
from
his
eyes
when
at
last
he
roused
himself
he
met
heidi
eyes
looking
wonderingly
at
him
heidi
he
said
taking
the
child
hand
in
his
that
was
a
beautiful
hymn
of
yours
and
there
was
a
happier
ring
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
we
will
come
out
here
together
another
day
and
you
will
let
me
hear
it
again
peter
meanwhile
had
been
giving
vent
to
his
anger
it
was
now
some
days
since
heidi
had
been
out
with
him
and
when
at
last
she
did
come
there
she
sat
the
whole
time
beside
the
old
gentleman
and
peter
could
not
get
a
word
with
her
he
got
into
a
terrible
temper
and
at
last
went
and
stood
some
way
back
behind
the
doctor
where
the
latter
could
not
see
him
and
doubling
his
fist
made
imaginary
hits
at
the
enemy
presently
he
doubled
both
fists
and
the
longer
heidi
stayed
beside
the
gentleman
the
more
fiercely
did
he
threaten
with
them
meanwhile
the
sun
had
risen
to
the
height
which
peter
knew
pointed
to
the
dinner
hour
all
of
a
sudden
he
called
at
the
top
of
his
voice
it
dinner
time
heidi
started
for
the
dinner
bag
so
that
the
doctor
might
eat
his
where
he
sat
but
he
stopped
her
telling
her
he
was
not
hungry
at
all
and
only
cared
for
a
glass
of
milk
as
he
wanted
to
climb
up
a
little
higher
then
heidi
found
that
she
also
was
not
hungry
and
only
wanted
milk
and
she
should
like
she
said
to
take
the
doctor
up
to
the
large
rock
where
greenfinch
had
nearly
jumped
down
and
killed
herself
so
she
ran
and
explained
matters
to
peter
telling
him
to
go
and
get
milk
for
the
two
peter
seemed
hardly
to
understand
who
is
going
to
eat
what
is
in
the
bag
then
he
asked
you
can
have
it
she
answered
only
first
make
haste
and
get
the
milk
peter
had
seldom
performed
any
task
more
promptly
for
he
thought
of
the
bag
and
its
contents
which
now
belonged
to
him
as
soon
as
the
other
two
were
sitting
quietly
drinking
their
milk
he
opened
it
and
quite
trembled
for
joy
at
the
sight
of
the
meat
and
he
was
just
putting
his
hand
in
to
draw
it
out
when
something
seemed
to
hold
him
back
his
conscience
smote
him
at
the
remembrance
of
how
he
had
stood
with
his
doubled
fists
behind
the
doctor
who
was
giving
up
to
him
his
whole
good
dinner
he
felt
as
if
he
could
not
now
enjoy
it
but
all
at
once
he
jumped
up
and
ran
back
to
the
spot
where
he
had
stood
before
and
there
held
up
his
open
hands
as
a
sign
that
he
had
no
longer
any
wish
to
use
them
as
fists
and
kept
them
up
until
he
felt
he
had
made
amends
for
his
past
conduct
then
he
rushed
back
and
sat
down
to
the
double
enjoyment
of
a
clear
conscience
and
unusually
satisfying
meal
heidi
and
the
doctor
climbed
and
talked
for
a
long
while
until
the
latter
said
it
was
time
for
him
to
be
going
back
and
no
doubt
heidi
would
like
to
go
and
be
with
her
goats
but
heidi
would
not
hear
of
this
as
then
the
doctor
would
have
to
go
the
whole
way
down
the
mountain
alone
she
insisted
on
accompanying
him
as
far
as
the
grandfather
hut
or
even
a
little
further
she
kept
hold
of
her
friend
hand
all
the
time
and
the
whole
way
she
entertained
him
with
accounts
of
this
thing
and
that
but
at
last
the
doctor
insisted
on
her
going
back
so
they
bid
each
other
and
the
doctor
continued
his
descent
turning
now
and
again
to
look
back
and
each
time
he
saw
heidi
standing
on
the
same
spot
and
waving
her
hand
to
him
even
so
in
the
old
days
had
his
own
dear
little
daughter
watched
him
when
he
went
from
home
illustration
it
was
a
bright
sunny
autumn
month
the
doctor
came
up
to
the
hut
every
morning
and
thence
made
excursions
over
the
mountain
accompanied
him
on
some
of
his
higher
ascents
the
doctor
found
great
pleasure
in
his
companion
conversation
and
was
astonished
at
his
knowledge
of
the
plants
that
grew
on
the
mountain
he
was
well
versed
also
in
the
ways
of
the
animals
great
and
small
and
had
many
amusing
anecdotes
to
tell
of
these
dwellers
in
caves
and
holes
and
in
the
tops
of
the
fir
trees
and
so
the
time
passed
pleasantly
and
quickly
for
the
doctor
who
seldom
said
to
the
old
man
at
the
end
of
the
day
without
adding
i
never
leave
you
friend
without
having
learnt
something
new
from
you
on
some
of
the
very
finest
days
however
the
doctor
would
wander
out
again
with
heidi
and
then
the
two
would
sit
together
as
on
the
first
day
and
the
child
would
repeat
her
hymns
and
tell
the
doctor
things
which
she
alone
knew
peter
sat
at
a
little
distance
from
them
but
he
was
now
quite
reconciled
in
spirit
and
gave
vent
to
no
angry
pantomime
september
had
drawn
to
its
close
and
one
morning
the
doctor
appeared
looking
less
cheerful
than
usual
it
was
his
last
day
he
said
as
he
must
return
to
frankfurt
but
he
was
grieved
at
having
to
say
to
the
mountain
which
had
begun
to
feel
quite
like
home
to
him
on
his
side
greatly
regretted
the
departure
of
his
guest
and
heidi
had
been
accustomed
for
so
long
to
see
her
good
friend
every
day
that
she
could
hardly
believe
the
time
had
suddenly
come
to
separate
she
walked
part
way
down
the
mountain
with
him
still
unable
to
grasp
the
idea
that
he
was
going
for
good
after
some
distance
the
doctor
stood
still
and
passing
his
hand
over
the
child
curly
head
said
now
heidi
you
must
go
back
and
i
must
say
if
only
i
could
take
you
with
me
to
frankfurt
and
keep
you
there
the
picture
of
frankfurt
rose
before
the
child
eyes
its
endless
rows
of
houses
its
hard
streets
and
even
the
vision
of
miss
rottermeyer
and
tinette
and
she
answered
hesitatingly
i
would
rather
that
you
came
back
to
us
yes
you
are
right
that
would
be
better
but
now
heidi
the
child
put
her
hand
in
his
and
looked
up
at
him
the
kind
eyes
looking
down
on
her
had
tears
in
them
then
the
doctor
tore
himself
away
and
quickly
continued
his
descent
heidi
remained
standing
without
moving
the
friendly
eyes
with
the
tears
in
them
had
gone
to
her
heart
all
at
once
she
burst
into
tears
and
started
running
as
fast
as
she
could
after
the
departing
figure
calling
out
in
broken
tones
doctor
doctor
he
turned
round
and
waited
till
the
child
reached
him
the
tears
were
streaming
down
her
face
and
she
sobbed
out
i
will
come
to
frankfurt
with
you
now
at
once
and
i
will
stay
with
you
as
long
as
you
like
only
i
must
just
run
back
and
tell
grandfather
the
doctor
laid
his
hand
on
her
and
tried
to
calm
her
excitement
no
no
dear
child
he
said
kindly
not
now
you
must
stay
for
the
present
under
the
fir
trees
you
might
get
sick
again
but
if
i
am
ever
ill
and
alone
will
you
come
then
and
stay
with
me
may
i
know
that
there
would
then
be
some
one
to
look
after
me
and
care
for
me
yes
yes
i
will
come
the
very
day
you
send
for
me
and
i
love
you
nearly
as
much
as
grandfather
replied
heidi
who
had
not
yet
got
over
her
distress
and
so
the
doctor
again
bid
her
and
started
on
his
way
while
heidi
remained
looking
after
him
and
waving
her
hand
as
long
as
a
speck
of
him
could
be
seen
as
the
doctor
turned
for
the
last
time
and
looked
back
at
the
waving
heidi
and
the
sunny
mountain
he
said
to
himself
it
is
good
to
be
up
there
good
for
body
and
soul
and
a
man
might
learn
how
to
be
happy

chapter
xviii
a
new
home
for
the
winter
had
kept
his
word
and
was
not
spending
the
winter
in
his
old
home
as
soon
as
the
first
snow
began
to
fall
he
had
shut
up
the
hut
and
the
outside
buildings
and
gone
down
to
doerfli
with
heidi
and
the
goats
near
the
church
was
a
straggling
building
which
had
once
been
the
home
of
a
distinguished
soldier
it
was
rented
to
poor
people
who
paid
but
a
small
sum
and
when
any
part
of
the
building
fell
it
was
allowed
to
remain
as
soon
as
the
grandfather
had
made
up
his
mind
to
spend
the
winter
in
doerfli
he
rented
the
old
place
and
worked
during
the
autumn
to
get
it
sound
and
tight
in
the
middle
of
october
he
and
heidi
took
up
their
residence
there
on
approaching
the
house
from
the
back
one
came
first
into
an
open
space
with
a
wall
on
either
side
of
which
one
was
half
in
ruins
above
this
rose
the
arch
of
an
old
window
thickly
overgrown
with
ivy
which
spread
over
the
remains
of
a
domed
roof
that
had
evidently
been
part
of
a
chapel
a
large
hall
came
next
which
lay
open
without
doors
to
the
square
outside
here
also
walls
and
roof
only
partially
remained
and
indeed
what
was
left
of
the
roof
looked
as
if
it
might
fall
at
any
minute
had
it
not
been
for
two
stout
pillars
that
supported
it
had
here
put
up
a
wooden
partition
and
covered
the
floor
with
straw
for
this
was
to
be
the
goats
house
endless
passages
led
from
this
through
the
rents
of
which
the
sky
as
well
as
the
fields
and
the
road
outside
could
be
seen
at
intervals
but
at
last
one
came
to
a
stout
oak
door
that
led
into
a
room
that
still
stood
intact
here
the
walls
and
the
dark
wainscoting
remained
as
good
as
ever
and
in
the
corner
was
an
immense
stove
reaching
nearly
to
the
ceiling
on
the
white
tiles
of
which
were
painted
large
pictures
in
blue
these
represented
old
castles
surrounded
with
trees
and
huntsmen
riding
out
with
their
hounds
or
else
a
quiet
lake
scene
with
broad
oak
trees
and
a
man
fishing
a
seat
ran
all
round
the
stove
so
that
one
could
sit
at
one
ease
and
study
the
pictures
these
attracted
heidi
attention
at
once
and
she
had
no
sooner
arrived
with
her
grandfather
than
she
ran
and
seated
herself
and
began
to
examine
them
but
when
she
had
gradually
worked
herself
round
to
the
back
something
else
diverted
her
attention
in
the
large
space
between
the
stove
and
the
wall
four
planks
had
been
put
together
as
if
to
make
a
large
receptacle
for
apples
there
were
no
apples
however
inside
but
something
heidi
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
for
it
was
her
very
own
bed
with
its
hay
mattress
and
sheets
and
sack
for
a
coverlid
just
as
she
had
it
up
at
the
hut
heidi
clapped
her
hands
for
joy
and
exclaimed
o
grandfather
this
is
my
room
how
nice
but
where
are
you
going
to
sleep
your
room
must
be
near
the
stove
or
you
will
freeze
he
replied
but
you
can
come
and
see
mine
too
heidi
got
down
and
skipped
across
the
large
room
after
her
grandfather
who
opened
a
door
at
the
farther
end
leading
into
a
smaller
one
which
was
to
be
his
then
came
another
door
heidi
pushed
it
open
and
stood
amazed
for
here
was
an
immense
room
like
a
kitchen
larger
than
anything
of
the
kind
that
heidi
had
seen
before
there
was
still
plenty
of
work
for
the
grandfather
before
this
room
could
be
finished
for
there
were
holes
and
cracks
in
the
walls
through
which
the
wind
whistled
and
yet
he
had
already
nailed
up
so
many
new
planks
that
it
looked
as
if
a
lot
of
small
cupboards
had
been
set
up
round
the
room
he
had
however
made
the
large
old
door
safe
with
many
screws
and
nails
as
a
protection
against
the
outside
air
and
this
was
very
necessary
for
just
beyond
was
a
mass
of
ruined
building
overgrown
with
tall
weeds
which
made
a
for
innumerable
beetles
and
lizards
heidi
was
very
delighted
with
her
new
home
and
by
the
morning
after
their
arrival
she
knew
every
nook
and
corner
so
thoroughly
that
she
could
take
peter
over
it
and
show
him
all
that
was
to
be
seen
indeed
she
would
not
let
him
go
till
he
had
examined
every
single
wonderful
thing
contained
in
it
heidi
slept
soundly
in
her
corner
by
the
stove
but
every
morning
when
she
first
awoke
she
still
thought
she
was
on
the
mountain
and
that
she
must
run
outside
at
once
to
see
if
the
fir
trees
were
so
quiet
because
their
branches
were
weighed
down
with
the
thick
snow
she
had
to
look
about
her
for
some
minutes
before
she
felt
quite
sure
where
she
was
and
a
certain
sensation
of
trouble
and
oppression
would
come
over
her
as
she
grew
aware
that
she
was
not
at
home
in
the
hut
but
then
she
would
hear
her
grandfather
voice
outside
attending
to
the
goats
and
these
would
give
one
or
two
loud
bleats
as
if
calling
to
her
to
make
haste
and
go
to
them
and
then
heidi
was
happy
again
for
she
knew
she
was
still
at
home
and
she
would
jump
gladly
out
of
bed
and
run
out
to
the
animals
as
quickly
as
she
could
on
the
fourth
morning
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
grandfather
she
said
i
must
go
up
to
see
grandmother
today
she
ought
not
to
be
alone
so
long
but
the
grandfather
would
not
agree
to
this
neither
today
nor
tomorrow
can
you
go
he
said
the
mountain
is
covered
in
snow
and
the
snow
is
still
falling
the
sturdy
peter
can
hardly
get
along
a
little
creature
like
you
would
soon
be
smothered
by
it
and
we
should
not
be
able
to
find
you
again
wait
a
bit
till
it
freezes
then
you
will
be
able
to
walk
over
the
hard
snow
heidi
now
went
to
school
in
doerfli
and
eagerly
set
to
work
to
learn
all
that
was
taught
her
she
hardly
ever
saw
peter
there
for
as
a
rule
he
was
absent
the
teacher
was
an
man
who
merely
remarked
now
and
then
peter
is
not
turning
up
today
again
it
seems
but
there
is
a
lot
of
snow
up
on
the
mountain
and
i
daresay
he
can
not
get
along
peter
however
always
seemed
able
to
make
his
way
through
the
snow
in
the
evening
when
school
was
over
and
he
then
generally
paid
heidi
a
visit
at
last
after
some
days
when
peter
climbed
out
of
his
window
one
morning
the
door
was
quite
blocked
by
the
snow
outside
he
was
taken
by
surprise
for
instead
of
sinking
into
the
snow
he
fell
on
the
hard
ground
and
went
sliding
some
way
down
the
mountain
side
like
a
sleigh
before
he
could
stop
himself
he
picked
himself
up
and
tested
the
hardness
of
the
ground
by
stamping
on
it
and
trying
with
all
his
might
to
dig
his
heels
into
it
but
even
then
he
could
not
break
off
a
single
little
splinter
of
ice
the
alm
was
frozen
hard
as
iron
this
was
just
what
peter
had
been
hoping
for
as
he
knew
now
that
heidi
would
be
able
to
come
up
to
see
them
he
quickly
got
back
into
the
house
swallowed
the
milk
which
his
mother
had
ready
for
him
thrust
a
piece
of
bread
in
his
pocket
and
said
i
must
be
off
to
school
and
in
another
minute
was
shooting
down
the
mountain
on
his
sled
he
went
like
lightning
and
when
he
reached
doerfli
which
stood
on
the
direct
road
to
mayenfeld
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
on
further
so
down
he
still
went
till
he
reached
the
level
ground
where
the
sled
came
to
a
pause
of
its
own
accord
some
little
way
beyond
mayenfeld
he
knew
it
was
too
late
to
get
to
school
now
as
lessons
would
already
have
begun
and
it
would
take
him
a
good
hour
to
walk
back
to
doerfli
so
he
took
his
time
about
returning
and
reached
doerfli
just
as
heidi
had
got
home
from
school
and
was
sitting
at
dinner
with
her
grandfather
peter
walked
in
exclaiming
as
he
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
got
it
now
got
it
what
asked
the
uncle
your
words
sound
quite
warlike
general
the
frost
explained
peter
oh
now
i
can
go
and
see
grandmother
said
heidi
joyfully
for
she
had
understood
peter
words
at
once
but
why
were
you
not
at
school
then
you
could
have
come
down
on
the
sled
she
added
reproachfully
for
it
did
not
agree
with
heidi
ideas
of
good
behavior
to
stay
away
when
it
was
possible
to
be
there
it
carried
me
on
too
far
and
i
was
too
late
peter
replied
i
call
that
being
a
deserter
said
the
uncle
and
deserters
get
their
ears
pulled
as
you
know
peter
gave
a
tug
to
his
cap
in
alarm
for
there
was
no
one
of
whom
he
stood
in
so
much
awe
as
and
an
army
leader
like
yourself
ought
to
be
doubly
ashamed
of
running
away
continued
what
would
you
think
of
your
goats
if
one
went
off
this
way
and
another
that
and
refused
to
follow
and
do
what
was
good
for
them
what
would
you
do
then
i
should
beat
them
said
peter
promptly
and
if
a
boy
behaved
like
these
unruly
goats
and
he
got
a
beating
for
it
what
would
you
say
then
serves
him
right
was
the
answer
good
then
understand
this
next
time
you
let
your
sled
carry
you
past
the
school
when
you
ought
to
be
inside
at
your
lessons
come
on
to
me
afterwards
and
receive
what
you
deserve
peter
understood
the
drift
of
the
old
man
questions
and
that
he
was
the
boy
who
behaved
like
the
unruly
goats
and
he
looked
somewhat
fearfully
towards
the
corner
to
see
if
there
happened
to
be
a
stick
around
but
now
the
grandfather
suddenly
said
in
a
cheerful
voice
come
and
sit
down
and
have
something
and
afterwards
heidi
shall
go
with
you
bring
her
back
this
evening
and
you
will
find
supper
waiting
for
you
here
this
unexpected
turn
of
conversation
set
peter
grinning
all
over
with
delight
he
obeyed
without
hesitation
and
took
his
seat
beside
heidi
but
the
child
could
not
eat
in
her
excitement
at
the
thought
of
going
to
see
grandmother
she
ran
to
the
cupboard
and
brought
out
the
warm
cloak
clara
had
sent
her
with
this
on
and
the
hood
drawn
over
her
head
she
was
all
ready
for
her
journey
she
stood
waiting
beside
peter
and
as
soon
as
his
last
mouthful
had
disappeared
she
said
come
along
now
as
the
two
walked
together
heidi
had
much
to
tell
peter
of
her
two
goats
that
had
been
so
unhappy
the
first
day
in
their
new
stall
that
they
would
not
eat
anything
but
stood
hanging
their
heads
not
even
rousing
themselves
to
bleat
and
when
she
asked
her
grandfather
the
reason
of
this
he
told
her
it
was
the
same
with
the
goats
as
with
her
in
frankfurt
for
it
was
the
first
time
in
their
lives
they
had
come
down
from
the
mountain
and
you
do
know
what
that
is
peter
unless
you
have
felt
it
yourself
added
heidi
when
they
reached
their
destination
they
found
brigitta
sitting
alone
knitting
for
the
grandmother
was
not
very
well
and
had
to
stay
in
bed
on
account
of
the
cold
heidi
had
never
before
missed
the
old
figure
in
her
place
in
the
corner
and
she
ran
quickly
into
the
next
room
there
lay
grandmother
on
her
little
poorly
covered
bed
wrapped
up
in
her
warm
grey
shawl
thank
god
she
exclaimed
as
heidi
came
running
in
the
poor
old
woman
had
had
a
secret
fear
at
heart
all
through
the
autumn
especially
if
heidi
was
absent
for
any
length
of
time
for
peter
had
told
her
of
a
strange
gentleman
who
had
come
from
frankfurt
and
who
had
gone
out
with
them
and
always
talked
to
heidi
and
she
had
felt
sure
he
had
come
to
take
her
away
again
even
when
she
heard
he
had
gone
off
alone
she
still
had
an
idea
that
a
messenger
would
be
sent
over
from
frankfurt
to
take
the
child
heidi
went
up
to
the
side
of
the
bed
and
said
are
you
very
ill
grandmother
no
no
child
answered
the
old
woman
reassuringly
passing
her
hand
lovingly
over
the
child
head
it
only
the
frost
that
has
got
into
my
bones
a
bit
shall
you
be
quite
well
then
directly
it
turns
warm
again
yes
god
willing
or
even
before
that
for
i
want
to
get
back
to
my
spinning
i
thought
perhaps
i
should
do
a
little
today
but
tomorrow
i
am
sure
to
be
all
right
again
heidi
noticed
that
the
grandmother
was
wrapped
up
in
her
nice
shawl
and
exclaimed
in
frankfurt
everybody
puts
on
a
shawl
to
go
out
walking
did
you
think
it
was
to
be
worn
in
bed
grandmother
i
put
it
on
dear
child
to
keep
myself
from
freezing
and
i
am
so
pleased
with
it
for
my
bedclothes
are
not
very
thick
she
answered
but
grandmother
continued
heidi
your
bed
is
not
right
because
it
goes
downhill
at
your
head
instead
of
uphill
i
know
it
child
i
can
feel
it
and
the
grandmother
put
up
her
hand
to
the
thin
flat
pillow
which
was
little
more
than
a
board
under
her
head
to
make
herself
more
comfortable
the
pillow
was
never
very
thick
and
i
have
lain
on
it
now
for
so
many
years
that
it
has
grown
quite
flat
oh
if
only
i
had
asked
clara
to
let
me
take
away
my
frankfurt
bed
said
heidi
i
had
three
large
pillows
one
above
the
other
so
that
i
could
hardly
sleep
and
i
used
to
slip
down
to
try
and
find
a
flat
place
and
then
i
had
to
pull
myself
up
again
because
it
was
proper
to
sleep
there
like
that
could
you
sleep
like
that
grandmother
oh
yes
the
pillows
keep
one
warm
and
it
is
easier
to
breathe
when
the
head
is
high
answered
the
grandmother
but
we
will
not
talk
about
that
for
i
have
so
much
that
other
old
sick
people
are
without
for
which
i
thank
god
there
is
the
nice
bread
i
get
every
day
and
this
warm
wrap
and
your
visits
heidi
will
you
read
me
something
today
heidi
ran
into
the
next
room
to
get
the
hymn
book
then
she
picked
out
the
favorite
hymns
one
after
another
for
she
knew
them
all
by
heart
now
and
was
as
pleased
as
the
grandmother
to
hear
them
again
after
so
many
days
the
grandmother
lay
with
folded
hands
while
a
smile
of
peace
stole
over
the
worn
troubled
face
like
one
to
whom
good
news
has
been
brought
suddenly
heidi
paused
grandmother
are
you
feeling
quite
well
again
already
yes
child
i
have
grown
better
while
listening
to
you
read
it
to
the
end
the
child
read
on
and
when
she
came
to
the
last
words
as
the
eyes
grow
dim
and
darkness
closes
round
the
soul
grows
clearer
sees
the
goal
to
which
it
travels
gladly
feels
its
home
is
nearer
the
grandmother
repeated
them
once
or
twice
to
herself
with
a
look
of
happy
expectation
on
her
face
and
heidi
took
equal
pleasure
in
them
for
the
picture
of
the
beautiful
sunny
day
of
her
return
home
rose
before
her
eyes
and
she
exclaimed
joyfully
grandmother
i
know
exactly
what
it
is
like
to
go
home
a
little
later
heidi
said
it
is
growing
dark
and
i
must
go
i
am
so
glad
to
think
that
you
are
quite
well
again
she
ran
into
the
next
room
and
bid
peter
come
quickly
for
it
had
now
grown
quite
dark
but
when
they
got
outside
they
found
the
moon
shining
down
on
the
white
snow
and
everything
as
clear
as
in
the
daylight
peter
got
his
sled
put
heidi
at
the
back
he
himself
sitting
in
front
to
guide
and
down
the
mountain
they
shot
like
two
birds
darting
through
the
air
illustration
when
heidi
was
lying
that
night
on
her
high
bed
of
hay
she
thought
of
the
grandmother
on
her
low
pillow
and
of
all
she
had
said
about
the
light
and
comfort
that
awoke
in
her
when
she
heard
the
hymns
and
she
thought
if
i
could
read
to
her
every
day
then
i
should
go
on
making
her
better
but
she
knew
that
it
would
be
a
week
if
not
two
before
she
would
be
able
to
go
up
the
mountain
again
this
was
a
thought
of
great
trouble
to
heidi
and
she
tried
hard
to
think
of
some
way
which
would
enable
the
grandmother
to
hear
the
words
she
loved
every
day
suddenly
an
idea
struck
her
and
she
was
so
delighted
with
it
that
she
could
hardly
bear
to
wait
for
morning
so
eager
was
she
to
begin
carrying
out
her
plan
all
at
once
she
sat
upright
in
her
bed
for
she
had
been
so
busy
with
her
thoughts
that
she
had
forgotten
to
say
her
prayers
and
she
never
now
finished
her
day
without
saying
them
when
she
had
prayed
with
all
her
heart
for
herself
her
grandfather
and
grandmother
she
lay
back
again
on
the
warm
soft
hay
and
slept
soundly
and
peacefully
till
the
morning
broke
chapter
xix
heidi
teaches
obstinate
peter
peter
arrived
punctually
at
school
the
following
day
he
had
brought
his
dinner
with
him
for
all
the
children
who
lived
at
a
distance
regularly
seated
themselves
at
on
the
tables
and
resting
their
feet
firmly
on
the
benches
spread
out
their
meal
on
their
knees
and
so
ate
their
dinner
while
those
living
in
doerfli
went
home
for
theirs
till
one
they
might
all
do
as
they
liked
and
then
school
began
again
as
soon
as
peter
finished
his
lessons
he
went
over
to
uncle
to
see
heidi
when
he
walked
into
the
large
room
at
uncle
today
heidi
immediately
rushed
forward
and
took
hold
of
him
and
said
i
thought
of
something
peter
what
is
it
he
asked
you
must
learn
to
read
she
informed
him
i
have
learnt
was
the
answer
yes
yes
but
i
mean
so
that
you
can
really
make
use
of
it
continued
heidi
eagerly
i
never
shall
was
the
prompt
reply
nobody
believes
that
you
can
not
learn
nor
i
either
now
said
heidi
in
a
very
decided
tone
of
voice
grandmamma
in
frankfurt
said
long
ago
that
it
was
not
true
and
she
told
me
not
to
believe
you
peter
looked
rather
taken
aback
at
this
piece
of
intelligence
i
will
soon
teach
you
to
read
for
i
know
how
continued
heidi
you
must
learn
at
once
and
then
you
can
read
one
or
two
hymns
every
day
to
grandmother
oh
i
do
care
about
that
he
grumbled
in
reply
this
way
of
refusing
to
agree
to
what
was
right
and
kind
and
to
what
heidi
had
so
much
at
heart
aroused
her
anger
with
flashing
eyes
she
stood
facing
the
boy
and
said
threateningly
if
you
wo
learn
as
i
want
you
to
i
will
tell
you
what
will
happen
you
know
your
mother
has
often
spoken
of
sending
you
to
frankfurt
that
you
may
learn
a
lot
of
things
and
i
know
where
the
boys
there
have
to
go
to
school
clara
pointed
out
the
great
house
to
me
when
we
were
driving
together
and
they
do
only
go
when
they
are
boys
but
have
more
lessons
still
when
they
are
grown
men
i
have
seen
them
myself
and
you
must
think
they
have
only
one
kind
teacher
like
we
have
there
are
ever
so
many
of
them
all
in
the
school
at
the
same
time
and
they
are
all
dressed
in
black
as
if
they
were
going
to
church
and
have
black
hats
on
their
heads
as
high
as
that
and
heidi
held
out
her
hand
to
show
their
height
from
the
floor
peter
felt
a
cold
shudder
run
down
his
back
and
you
will
have
to
go
in
among
all
those
gentlemen
continued
heidi
with
increasing
animation
and
when
it
comes
to
your
turn
you
wo
be
able
to
read
and
will
make
mistakes
in
your
spelling
then
you
see
how
they
make
fun
of
you
even
worse
than
tinette
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
what
she
was
like
when
she
was
scornful
well
i
learn
then
said
peter
half
sorrowfully
and
half
angrily
heidi
was
instantly
mollified
that
right
then
we
begin
at
once
she
said
cheerfully
among
other
presents
clara
had
sent
heidi
a
book
which
the
latter
had
decided
would
be
just
the
thing
for
teaching
peter
as
it
was
an
a
b
c
book
with
rhyming
lines
so
the
two
sat
together
at
the
table
with
their
heads
bent
over
the
book
and
began
the
lesson
peter
was
made
to
spell
out
the
first
sentence
two
or
three
times
over
for
heidi
wished
him
to
get
it
correct
and
fluent
at
last
she
said
you
do
seem
able
to
get
it
right
but
i
will
read
it
aloud
to
you
once
when
you
know
what
it
ought
to
be
you
will
find
it
easier
and
she
read
out
a
b
c
must
be
learnt
today
or
the
judge
will
call
you
up
to
pay
i
sha
go
said
peter
obstinately
go
where
asked
heidi
before
the
judge
he
answered
well
then
make
haste
and
learn
these
three
letters
then
you
have
to
go
peter
went
at
his
task
again
and
repeated
the
three
letters
so
many
times
and
with
such
determination
that
she
said
at
last
you
must
know
those
three
now
seeing
what
an
effect
the
first
two
lines
of
verse
had
had
upon
him
she
thought
she
would
prepare
the
ground
a
little
for
the
following
lessons
wait
and
i
will
read
you
some
of
the
next
sentences
she
continued
then
you
will
see
what
else
there
is
to
expect
and
she
began
in
a
clear
slow
voice
d
e
f
g
must
run
with
ease
or
something
will
follow
that
does
not
please
should
h
i
j
k
be
now
forgot
disgrace
is
yours
upon
the
spot
and
then
l
m
must
follow
at
once
or
punished
you
be
for
a
sorry
dunce
if
you
knew
what
next
awaited
you
you
haste
to
learn
n
o
p
q
now

s
t
be
quick
about
or
worse
will
follow
there
little
doubt
heidi
paused
for
peter
was
so
quiet
that
she
looked
to
see
what
he
was
doing
these
many
secret
threats
and
hints
of
dreadful
punishments
had
so
affected
him
that
he
sat
as
if
petrified
and
stared
at
heidi
with
eyes
her
kind
heart
was
moved
at
once
and
she
said
wishing
to
reassure
him
you
need
not
be
afraid
peter
come
here
to
me
every
evening
and
if
you
learn
as
you
have
today
you
will
at
least
know
all
your
letters
and
the
other
things
wo
come
but
you
must
come
regularly
not
only
now
and
then
as
you
do
to
school
even
if
it
snows
it
wo
hurt
you
he
promised
and
the
lessons
being
finished
for
this
day
he
now
went
home
peter
obeyed
heidi
instructions
punctually
and
every
evening
went
diligently
to
work
to
learn
the
letters
taking
the
sentences
thoroughly
to
heart
the
grandfather
was
frequently
in
the
room
smoking
his
pipe
comfortably
while
the
lesson
was
going
on
and
his
face
twitched
occasionally
as
if
he
was
overtaken
with
a
sudden
fit
of
merriment
peter
was
often
invited
to
stay
to
supper
after
the
great
exertion
he
had
gone
through
which
richly
compensated
him
for
the
anguish
of
mind
he
had
suffered
with
the
sentence
for
the
day
so
the
winter
went
by
and
peter
really
made
progress
with
his
letters
but
he
went
through
a
terrible
fight
each
day
with
the
sentences
he
had
got
at
last
to
heidi
read
out
and
if
you
put
the
u
for
v
you
go
where
you
would
not
like
to
be
peter
growled
yes
but
i
sha
go
but
he
was
very
diligent
that
day
as
if
under
the
impression
that
some
one
would
seize
him
suddenly
by
the
collar
and
drag
him
where
he
would
rather
not
go
the
next
evening
heidi
read
if
you
falter
at
w
worst
of
all
look
at
the
stick
against
the
wall
peter
looked
at
the
wall
and
said
scornfully
there
is
one
yes
but
do
you
know
what
grandfather
has
in
his
box
asked
heidi
a
stick
as
thick
almost
as
your
arm
and
if
he
took
that
out
you
might
well
say
look
at
the
stick
on
the
wall
peter
knew
that
thick
hazel
stick
and
immediately
bent
his
head
over
the
w
and
struggled
to
master
it
another
day
the
lines
ran
then
comes
the
x
for
you
to
say
or
be
sure
you
get
no
food
today
peter
looked
towards
the
cupboard
where
the
bread
and
cheese
were
kept
and
said
crossly
i
never
said
that
i
should
forget
the
x
that
all
right
if
you
do
forget
it
we
can
go
on
to
learn
the
next
and
then
you
will
only
have
one
more
replied
heidi
anxious
to
encourage
him
peter
did
not
quite
understand
but
when
heidi
went
on
and
read
and
should
you
make
a
stop
at
y
they
point
at
you
and
cry
fie
fie
all
the
gentlemen
in
frankfurt
with
tall
black
hats
on
their
heads
and
scorn
and
mockery
in
their
faces
rose
up
before
his
mind
eye
and
he
threw
himself
with
energy
on
the
y
not
letting
it
go
till
at
last
he
knew
it
so
thoroughly
that
he
could
see
what
it
was
like
even
when
he
shut
his
eyes
he
arrived
on
the
following
day
in
a
somewhat
lofty
frame
of
mind
for
there
was
now
only
one
letter
to
struggle
over
and
when
heidi
began
the
lesson
with
reading
aloud
make
haste
with
z
if
you
too
slow
off
to
the
hottentots
you
go
peter
remarked
scornfully
i
dare
say
when
no
one
knows
even
where
such
people
live
i
assure
you
peter
replied
heidi
grandfather
knows
all
about
them
wait
a
second
and
i
will
run
and
ask
him
for
he
is
only
over
the
way
with
the
pastor
and
she
rose
and
ran
to
the
door
to
put
her
words
into
action
but
peter
cried
out
in
a
voice
of
agony
stop
for
he
already
saw
himself
being
carried
off
by
and
the
pastor
and
sent
straight
away
to
the
hottentots
since
as
yet
he
did
not
know
his
last
letter
his
cry
of
fear
brought
heidi
back
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
in
astonishment
nothing
come
back
i
am
going
to
learn
my
letter
he
said
stammering
with
fear
heidi
however
herself
wished
to
know
where
the
hottentots
lived
and
persisted
that
she
should
ask
her
grandfather
but
she
gave
in
at
last
to
peter
despairing
entreaties
she
insisted
on
his
doing
something
in
return
and
so
not
only
had
he
to
repeat
his
z
until
it
was
so
fixed
in
his
memory
that
he
could
never
forget
it
again
but
she
began
teaching
him
to
spell
and
peter
really
made
a
good
start
that
evening
so
it
went
on
from
day
to
day
the
frost
had
gone
and
the
snow
was
soft
again
and
moreover
fresh
snow
continually
fell
so
that
it
was
quite
three
weeks
before
heidi
could
go
to
the
grandmother
again
so
much
the
more
eagerly
did
she
pursue
her
teaching
so
that
peter
might
compensate
for
her
absence
by
reading
hymns
to
the
old
woman
one
evening
he
walked
in
home
after
leaving
heidi
and
as
he
entered
he
said
i
can
do
it
now
do
what
peter
asked
his
mother
read
he
answered
do
you
really
mean
it
did
you
hear
that
grandmother
she
called
out
the
grandmother
had
heard
and
was
already
wondering
how
such
a
thing
could
have
come
to
pass
i
must
read
one
of
the
hymns
now
heidi
told
me
to
he
went
on
to
inform
them
his
mother
hastily
brought
the
book
and
the
grandmother
lay
in
joyful
expectation
for
it
was
so
long
since
she
had
heard
the
good
words
peter
sat
down
to
the
table
and
began
to
read
his
mother
sat
beside
him
listening
with
surprise
and
exclaiming
at
the
close
of
each
verse
who
would
have
thought
it
possible
the
grandmother
did
not
speak
though
she
followed
the
words
he
read
with
strained
attention
it
happened
on
the
day
following
this
that
there
was
a
reading
lesson
in
peter
class
when
it
came
to
his
turn
the
teacher
said
we
must
pass
over
peter
as
usual
or
will
you
try
again
once
more
i
will
not
say
to
read
but
to
stammer
through
a
sentence
peter
took
the
book
and
read
off
three
lines
without
the
slightest
hesitation
the
teacher
put
down
his
book
and
stared
at
peter
as
at
some
and
marvelous
thing
unseen
before
at
last
he
spoke
peter
some
miracle
has
been
performed
upon
you
here
have
i
been
striving
with
patience
to
teach
you
and
you
have
not
hitherto
been
able
to
say
your
letters
even
and
now
just
as
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
waste
any
more
trouble
upon
you
you
suddenly
are
able
to
read
a
whole
sentence
properly
and
distinctly
how
has
such
a
miracle
come
to
pass
in
our
days
it
was
heidi
answered
peter
the
teacher
looked
in
astonishment
towards
heidi
who
was
sitting
innocently
on
her
bench
with
no
appearance
of
anything
supernatural
about
her
he
continued
i
have
noticed
a
change
in
you
altogether
peter
whereas
formerly
you
often
missed
coming
to
school
for
a
week
or
even
weeks
at
a
time
you
have
lately
not
stayed
away
a
single
day
who
has
wrought
this
change
for
good
in
you
illustration
it
was
uncle
answered
peter
with
increasing
surprise
the
teacher
looked
from
peter
to
heidi
and
back
again
at
peter
we
will
try
once
more
he
said
cautiously
and
peter
had
again
to
show
off
his
accomplishment
by
reading
another
three
lines
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
peter
could
read
as
soon
as
school
was
over
the
teacher
went
over
to
the
pastor
to
tell
him
this
piece
of
news
and
to
inform
him
of
the
happy
result
of
heidi
and
the
grandfather
combined
efforts
every
evening
peter
read
one
hymn
aloud
so
far
he
obeyed
heidi
nothing
would
induce
him
to
read
a
second
and
indeed
the
grandmother
never
asked
for
it
his
mother
brigitta
could
not
get
over
her
surprise
at
her
son
attainment
and
when
the
reader
was
in
bed
would
often
express
her
pleasure
at
it
now
he
has
learnt
to
read
there
is
no
knowing
what
may
be
made
of
him
yet
on
one
of
these
occasions
the
grandmother
answered
yes
it
is
good
for
him
to
have
learnt
something
but
i
shall
indeed
be
thankful
when
spring
is
here
again
and
heidi
can
come
they
are
not
like
the
same
hymns
when
peter
reads
them
so
many
words
seem
missing
and
i
try
to
think
what
they
ought
to
be
and
then
i
lose
the
sense
and
so
the
hymns
do
not
come
home
to
my
heart
as
when
heidi
reads
them
the
truth
was
that
peter
arranged
to
make
his
reading
as
little
troublesome
for
himself
as
possible
when
he
came
upon
a
word
that
he
thought
was
too
long
or
difficult
in
any
other
way
he
left
it
out
for
he
decided
that
a
word
or
two
less
in
a
verse
where
there
were
so
many
of
them
could
make
no
difference
to
his
grandmother
and
so
it
came
about
that
most
of
the
principal
words
were
missing
in
the
hymns
that
peter
read
aloud
chapter
xx
a
strange
looking
procession
it
was
the
month
of
may
the
clear
warm
sunshine
lay
upon
the
mountain
which
had
turned
green
again
the
last
snows
had
disappeared
and
the
sun
had
already
coaxed
many
of
the
flowers
to
show
their
bright
heads
above
the
grass
heidi
was
at
home
again
on
the
mountain
running
backwards
and
forwards
in
her
accustomed
way
not
knowing
which
spot
was
most
delightful
from
the
shed
at
the
back
came
the
sound
of
sawing
and
chopping
and
heidi
listened
to
it
with
pleasure
for
it
was
the
old
familiar
sound
she
had
known
from
the
beginning
of
her
life
up
here
suddenly
she
jumped
up
and
ran
round
for
she
must
know
what
her
grandfather
was
doing
in
front
of
the
shed
door
already
stood
a
finished
new
chair
and
a
second
was
in
course
of
construction
under
the
skilful
hand
oh
i
know
what
these
are
for
exclaimed
heidi
in
great
glee
we
shall
want
them
when
they
all
come
from
frankfurt
this
one
is
for
grandmamma
and
the
one
you
are
now
making
is
for
clara
and
then
then
there
will
i
suppose
have
to
be
another
continued
heidi
with
more
hesitation
in
her
voice
or
do
you
think
grandfather
that
perhaps
miss
rottermeyer
will
not
come
with
them
well
i
can
not
say
just
yet
replied
her
grandfather
but
it
will
be
safer
to
make
one
so
that
we
can
offer
her
a
seat
if
she
does
while
talking
with
the
grandfather
there
was
heard
from
above
a
whistling
and
calling
which
heidi
immediately
recognized
she
ran
out
and
found
herself
surrounded
by
her
friends
they
were
apparently
as
pleased
as
she
was
to
be
among
the
heights
again
for
they
leaped
about
and
bleated
for
joy
when
peter
at
last
got
up
to
her
he
handed
her
a
letter
there
he
exclaimed
did
some
one
give
you
this
while
you
were
out
with
the
goats
she
asked
in
her
surprise
no
was
the
answer
where
did
you
get
it
from
then
i
found
it
in
the
dinner
bag
which
was
true
to
a
certain
extent
the
letter
to
heidi
had
been
given
him
the
evening
before
by
the
postman
at
doerfli
and
peter
had
put
it
into
his
empty
bag
that
morning
he
had
stuffed
his
bread
and
cheese
on
the
top
of
it
and
had
forgotten
it
when
he
called
for
two
goats
only
when
he
had
finished
his
bread
and
cheese
at
and
was
searching
in
the
bag
for
any
last
crumbs
did
he
remember
the
letter
which
lay
at
the
bottom
heidi
read
the
address
carefully
then
she
ran
back
to
the
shed
holding
out
her
letter
to
her
grandfather
in
high
glee
from
frankfurt
from
clara
would
you
like
to
hear
it
the
grandfather
was
ready
and
pleased
to
do
so
as
was
peter
who
had
followed
heidi
into
the
shed
dearest
heidi
everything
is
packed
and
we
shall
start
now
in
two
or
three
days
as
soon
as
papa
himself
is
ready
to
leave
he
is
not
coming
with
us
as
he
has
first
to
go
to
paris
the
doctor
comes
every
day
and
as
soon
as
he
is
inside
the
door
he
cries
now
as
quickly
as
you
can
off
to
the
mountain
he
is
most
impatient
about
our
going
you
can
not
think
how
much
he
enjoyed
himself
when
he
was
with
you
he
has
called
nearly
every
day
this
winter
and
each
time
he
describes
over
again
all
he
did
with
you
and
the
grandfather
and
talks
of
the
mountains
and
the
flowers
and
of
the
great
silence
up
there
far
above
all
towns
and
villages
and
of
the
fresh
delicious
air
and
often
adds
one
can
help
getting
well
up
there
he
himself
is
quite
a
different
man
since
his
visit
and
looks
happy
again
oh
how
i
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
everything
and
to
being
with
you
on
the
mountain
and
to
making
the
acquaintance
of
peter
and
the
goats
illustration
i
shall
have
first
to
go
through
a
six
weeks
cure
at
ragatz
this
the
doctor
has
ordered
and
then
we
shall
move
up
to
doerfli
and
every
fine
day
i
shall
be
carried
up
the
mountain
in
my
chair
and
spend
the
day
with
you
grandmamma
is
traveling
with
me
and
will
remain
with
me
she
also
is
delighted
at
the
thought
of
paying
you
a
visit
but
just
imagine
miss
rottermeyer
refuses
to
come
with
us
almost
every
day
grandmamma
says
to
her
how
about
this
swiss
journey
my
worthy
rottermeyer
pray
say
if
you
really
would
like
to
come
with
us
but
she
always
thanks
grandmamma
very
politely
and
says
she
has
quite
made
up
her
mind
i
think
i
know
what
has
done
it
sebastian
gave
such
a
frightful
description
of
the
mountain
of
how
the
rocks
were
so
overhanging
and
dangerous
that
at
any
minute
you
might
fall
into
a
crevasse
and
how
it
was
such
steep
climbing
that
you
feared
at
every
step
to
go
slipping
to
the
bottom
and
that
goats
alone
could
make
their
way
up
without
fear
of
being
killed
she
shuddered
when
she
heard
him
tell
of
all
this
and
since
then
she
has
not
been
so
enthusiastic
about
switzerland
as
she
was
before
fear
has
also
taken
possession
of
tinette
and
she
also
refuses
to
come
so
grandmamma
and
i
will
be
alone
sebastian
will
go
with
us
as
far
as
ragatz
and
then
return
here
i
can
hardly
bear
waiting
till
i
see
you
again
dearest
heidi
grandmamma
sends
you
her
best
love
and
all
good
your
affectionate
friend
clara
as
soon
as
the
letter
had
been
read
peter
rushed
out
twirling
his
stick
in
the
air
in
such
a
reckless
fashion
that
the
frightened
goats
fled
down
the
mountain
before
him
with
higher
and
wider
leaps
than
usual
he
followed
at
full
speed
his
stick
still
raised
in
air
in
a
menacing
manner
as
if
he
was
longing
to
vent
his
fury
on
some
invisible
foe
this
foe
was
indeed
the
prospect
of
the
arrival
of
the
frankfurt
visitors
the
thought
of
whom
filled
him
with
exasperation
heidi
was
so
full
of
joyful
anticipation
that
she
determined
to
seize
the
first
possible
moment
next
day
to
go
down
and
tell
grandmother
who
was
coming
and
also
particularly
who
was
not
coming
the
old
lady
was
no
longer
confined
to
her
bed
she
was
back
in
her
corner
at
her
but
there
was
an
expression
on
her
face
of
mournful
anxiety
peter
had
come
in
the
evening
before
brimful
of
anger
and
had
told
about
the
large
party
who
were
coming
up
from
frankfurt
and
he
did
not
know
what
other
things
might
happen
after
that
and
the
old
woman
had
not
slept
all
night
pursued
by
the
old
thought
of
heidi
being
taken
from
her
heidi
ran
in
and
taking
her
little
stool
immediately
sat
down
by
grandmother
and
began
eagerly
pouring
out
all
her
news
growing
more
excited
with
her
pleasure
as
she
went
on
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
stopped
short
and
said
anxiously
what
is
the
matter
grandmother
are
you
a
bit
pleased
with
what
i
am
telling
you
yes
yes
of
course
child
since
it
gives
you
so
much
pleasure
she
answered
trying
to
look
more
cheerful
but
i
can
see
all
the
same
that
something
troubles
you
is
it
because
you
think
after
all
that
miss
rottermeyer
may
come
asked
heidi
beginning
to
feel
anxious
herself
no
no
it
is
nothing
child
said
the
grandmother
wishing
to
reassure
her
just
give
me
your
hand
that
i
may
feel
sure
you
are
there
no
doubt
it
would
be
the
best
thing
for
you
although
i
feel
i
could
scarcely
survive
it
i
do
not
want
anything
of
the
best
if
you
could
scarcely
survive
it
said
heidi
in
such
a
determined
tone
of
voice
that
the
fears
increased
as
she
felt
sure
the
people
from
frankfurt
were
coming
to
take
heidi
back
with
them
since
now
she
was
well
again
they
naturally
wished
to
have
her
with
them
once
more
but
she
was
anxious
to
hide
her
trouble
from
heidi
if
possible
as
the
latter
was
so
sympathetic
that
she
might
refuse
perhaps
to
go
away
and
that
would
not
be
right
heidi
she
said
there
is
something
that
would
comfort
me
and
calm
my
thoughts
read
me
the
hymn
beginning
things
will
work
for
good
heidi
found
the
place
at
once
and
read
out
in
her
clear
young
voice
all
things
will
work
for
good
to
those
who
trust
in
me
i
come
with
healing
on
my
wings
to
save
and
set
thee
free
yes
yes
that
is
just
what
i
wanted
to
hear
said
the
grandmother
and
the
deep
expression
of
trouble
passed
from
her
face
heidi
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
said
healing
means
that
which
cures
everything
and
makes
everybody
well
does
it
grandmother
yes
that
is
it
replied
the
old
woman
with
a
nod
of
assent
and
we
may
be
sure
everything
will
come
to
pass
according
to
god
good
purpose
when
the
evening
came
heidi
returned
home
up
the
mountain
the
stars
came
out
overhead
one
by
one
so
bright
and
sparkling
that
each
seemed
to
send
a
fresh
ray
of
joy
into
her
heart
not
only
were
the
nights
of
this
month
of
may
so
clear
and
bright
but
the
days
as
well
the
sun
rose
every
morning
into
the
cloudless
sky
as
undimmed
in
its
splendor
as
when
it
sank
the
evening
before
and
the
grandfather
would
look
out
early
and
exclaim
with
astonishment
this
is
indeed
a
wonderful
year
of
sun
it
will
make
all
the
shrubs
and
plants
grow
apace
you
will
have
to
see
general
that
your
army
does
not
get
out
of
hand
from
overfeeding
and
peter
would
swing
his
stick
with
an
air
of
assurance
and
an
expression
on
his
face
as
much
as
to
say
i
see
to
that
so
may
passed
everything
growing
greener
and
greener
and
then
came
the
month
of
june
with
a
hotter
sun
and
long
light
days
that
brought
the
flowers
out
all
over
the
mountain
so
that
every
spot
was
bright
with
them
and
the
air
full
of
their
sweet
scents
this
month
too
was
drawing
to
its
close
when
one
day
heidi
having
finished
her
household
duties
ran
out
with
the
intention
of
paying
first
a
visit
to
the
fir
trees
and
then
going
up
higher
to
see
if
the
bush
of
rock
roses
was
yet
in
bloom
for
its
flowers
were
so
lovely
when
standing
open
in
the
sun
but
just
as
she
was
turning
the
corner
of
the
hut
she
gave
such
a
loud
cry
that
her
grandfather
came
running
out
of
the
shed
to
see
what
had
happened
grandfather
grandfather
she
cried
beside
herself
with
excitement
come
here
look
look
the
old
man
was
by
her
side
by
this
time
and
looked
in
the
direction
of
her
outstretched
hand
a
procession
was
making
its
way
up
the
mountain
in
front
were
two
men
carrying
a
sedan
chair
in
which
sat
a
girl
well
wrapped
up
in
shawls
then
followed
a
horse
mounted
by
a
lady
who
was
looking
about
her
with
great
interest
and
talking
to
the
guide
who
walked
beside
her
then
a
reclining
chair
which
was
being
pushed
up
by
another
man
it
having
evidently
been
thought
safer
to
send
the
invalid
to
whom
it
belonged
up
the
steep
path
in
a
sedan
chair
the
procession
wound
up
with
a
porter
with
such
a
bundle
of
cloaks
shawls
and
furs
on
his
back
that
it
rose
well
above
his
head
here
they
come
here
they
come
shouted
heidi
jumping
with
joy
and
sure
enough
it
was
the
party
from
frankfurt
the
figures
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
at
last
they
had
actually
arrived
the
men
in
front
put
down
their
burden
heidi
rushed
forward
and
the
two
children
embraced
each
other
with
mutual
delight
grandmamma
having
also
reached
the
top
dismounted
and
gave
heidi
an
affectionate
greeting
before
turning
to
the
grandfather
who
had
meanwhile
come
up
to
welcome
his
guests
there
was
no
constraint
about
the
meeting
for
they
both
knew
each
other
perfectly
well
from
hearsay
and
felt
like
old
acquaintances
after
the
first
words
of
greeting
had
been
exchanged
grandmamma
broke
out
into
lively
expressions
of
admiration
what
a
magnificent
residence
you
have
uncle
i
could
hardly
have
believed
it
was
so
beautiful
a
king
might
well
envy
you
and
how
well
my
little
heidi
looks
like
a
wild
rose
she
continued
drawing
the
child
towards
her
and
stroking
her
fresh
pink
cheeks
i
do
know
which
way
to
look
first
it
is
all
so
lovely
what
do
you
say
to
it
clara
what
do
you
say
clara
was
gazing
round
entranced
she
had
never
imagined
much
less
seen
anything
so
beautiful
she
gave
vent
to
her
delight
in
cries
of
joy
o
grandmamma
she
said
i
should
like
to
remain
here
for
ever
the
grandfather
had
meanwhile
drawn
up
the
invalid
chair
and
spread
some
of
the
wraps
over
it
he
now
went
up
to
clara
supposing
we
carry
the
little
daughter
now
to
her
accustomed
chair
i
think
she
will
be
more
comfortable
the
travelling
sedan
is
rather
hard
he
said
and
without
waiting
for
any
one
to
help
him
he
lifted
the
child
in
his
strong
arms
and
laid
her
gently
down
on
her
own
couch
he
then
covered
her
over
carefully
and
arranged
her
feet
on
the
soft
cushion
as
if
he
had
never
done
anything
all
his
life
but
wait
on
cripples
the
grandmamma
looked
on
with
surprise
my
dear
uncle
she
exclaimed
if
i
knew
where
you
had
learned
to
nurse
i
would
at
once
send
all
the
nurses
i
know
to
the
same
place
that
they
might
handle
their
patients
in
like
manner
how
do
you
come
to
know
so
much
uncle
smiled
i
know
more
from
experience
than
training
he
answered
but
as
he
spoke
the
smile
died
away
and
a
look
of
sadness
passed
over
his
face
the
vision
rose
before
him
of
a
face
of
suffering
that
he
had
known
long
years
before
the
face
of
a
man
lying
crippled
on
his
couch
of
pain
and
unable
to
move
a
limb
the
man
had
been
his
captain
during
the
fierce
fighting
in
sicily
he
had
found
him
lying
wounded
and
had
carried
him
away
and
after
that
the
captain
would
suffer
no
one
else
near
him
and
uncle
had
stayed
and
nursed
him
till
his
sufferings
ended
in
death
it
all
came
back
to
uncle
now
and
it
seemed
natural
to
him
to
attend
the
sick
clara
and
to
show
her
all
those
kindly
attentions
with
which
he
had
once
been
so
familiar
o
heidi
if
only
i
could
walk
about
with
you
said
clara
longingly
if
i
could
but
go
and
look
at
the
fir
trees
and
at
everything
i
know
so
well
from
your
description
although
i
have
never
been
here
before
heidi
in
response
put
out
all
her
strength
and
after
a
slight
effort
managed
to
wheel
clara
chair
quite
easily
round
the
hut
to
the
fir
trees
there
they
paused
clara
had
never
seen
such
trees
before
with
their
tall
straight
stems
and
long
thick
branches
growing
thicker
and
thicker
till
they
touched
the
ground
even
the
grandmamma
who
had
followed
the
children
was
astonished
at
the
sight
of
them
heidi
had
now
wheeled
clara
toward
the
goat
shed
and
had
flung
open
the
door
so
that
clara
might
have
a
full
view
of
the
inside
clara
lamented
to
her
grandmother
that
they
would
have
to
leave
early
before
the
goats
came
home
i
should
so
like
to
have
seen
peter
and
his
whole
flock
oh
the
flowers
exclaimed
clara
look
at
the
bushes
of
red
flowers
and
all
the
nodding
blue
bells
oh
if
i
could
but
get
out
and
pick
some
heidi
ran
off
at
once
and
picked
her
a
large
nosegay
of
them
but
these
are
nothing
clara
she
said
laying
the
flowers
on
her
lap
if
you
could
come
up
higher
to
where
the
goats
are
feeding
then
you
would
indeed
see
something
bushes
on
bushes
of
the
red
centaury
and
ever
so
many
more
of
the
flowers
and
then
the
bright
yellow
rock
roses
that
gleam
like
pure
gold
and
all
crowding
together
in
the
one
spot
and
then
there
are
others
with
the
large
leaves
that
grandfather
calls
bright
eyes
and
the
brown
ones
with
little
round
heads
that
smell
so
delicious
oh
it
is
beautiful
up
there
and
if
you
sit
down
among
them
you
never
want
to
get
up
again
everything
looks
and
smells
so
lovely
heidi
eyes
sparkled
with
the
remembrance
of
what
she
was
describing
she
was
longing
herself
to
see
it
all
again
and
clara
caught
her
enthusiasm
and
looked
back
at
her
with
equal
longing
in
her
soft
blue
eyes
grandmamma
do
you
think
i
could
get
up
there
is
it
possible
for
me
to
go
she
asked
eagerly
if
only
i
could
walk
climb
about
everywhere
with
you
heidi
i
am
sure
i
could
push
you
up
the
chair
goes
so
easily
said
heidi
and
in
proof
of
her
words
she
sent
the
chair
at
such
a
pace
round
the
corner
that
it
nearly
went
flying
down
the
grandmamma
being
at
hand
however
stopped
it
in
time
the
grandfather
meantime
had
not
been
idle
he
had
by
this
time
put
the
table
and
extra
chairs
in
front
of
the
seat
so
that
they
might
all
sit
out
here
and
eat
the
dinner
that
was
preparing
inside
the
milk
and
the
cheese
were
soon
ready
and
then
the
company
sat
down
in
high
spirits
to
their
meal
grandmamma
was
enchanted
as
the
doctor
had
been
with
their
whence
one
could
see
far
along
the
valley
and
far
over
the
mountains
to
the
farthest
stretch
of
blue
sky
a
light
wind
blew
refreshingly
over
them
as
they
sat
at
table
and
the
rustling
of
the
fir
trees
made
a
festive
accompaniment
to
the
repast
i
never
enjoyed
anything
as
much
as
this
it
is
really
superb
cried
grandmamma
two
or
three
times
over
and
then
suddenly
in
a
tone
of
surprise
do
i
really
see
you
taking
a
second
piece
of
toasted
cheese
clara
there
sure
enough
was
a
second
slice
of
cheese
on
clara
plate
oh
it
does
taste
so
nice
grandmamma
better
than
all
the
dishes
we
have
at
ragatz
replied
clara
as
she
continued
eating
with
appetite
that
right
eat
what
you
can
exclaimed
uncle
it
the
mountain
air
which
makes
up
for
the
deficiencies
of
the
kitchen
and
so
the
meal
went
on
grandmamma
and
got
on
very
well
together
and
their
conversation
became
more
and
more
lively
they
were
so
thoroughly
agreed
in
their
opinions
of
men
and
things
and
the
world
in
general
that
they
might
have
been
taken
for
old
cronies
the
time
passed
merrily
and
then
grandmamma
looked
towards
the
west
and
said
we
must
soon
get
ready
to
go
clara
the
sun
is
a
good
way
down
the
men
will
be
here
directly
with
the
horse
and
sedan
clara
face
fell
and
she
said
beseechingly
oh
just
another
hour
grandmamma
or
two
hours
we
have
seen
inside
the
hut
yet
or
heidi
bed
or
any
of
the
other
things
if
only
the
day
was
ten
hours
long
well
that
is
not
possible
said
grandmamma
but
she
herself
was
anxious
to
see
inside
the
hut
so
they
all
rose
from
the
table
and
uncle
wheeled
clara
chair
to
the
door
but
there
they
came
to
a
standstill
for
the
chair
was
much
too
broad
to
pass
through
the
door
uncle
however
soon
settled
the
difficulty
by
lifting
clara
in
his
strong
arms
and
carrying
her
inside
grandmamma
went
all
round
and
examined
the
household
arrangements
and
was
very
much
amused
and
pleased
at
their
orderliness
and
the
cozy
appearance
of
everything
and
this
is
your
bedroom
up
here
heidi
is
it
not
she
asked
as
without
fear
she
mounted
the
ladder
to
the
hay
loft
oh
it
does
smell
sweet
what
a
healthy
place
to
sleep
in
she
went
up
to
the
round
window
and
looked
out
and
grandfather
followed
up
with
clara
in
his
arms
heidi
springing
up
after
them
then
they
all
stood
and
examined
heidi
wonderful
and
grandmamma
looked
thoughtfully
at
it
and
drew
in
from
time
to
time
fragrant
draughts
of
the
air
while
clara
was
charmed
beyond
words
with
the
sleeping
apartment
it
is
delightful
for
you
up
here
heidi
you
can
look
from
your
bed
straight
into
the
sky
and
then
such
a
delicious
smell
all
round
you
and
outside
the
fir
trees
waving
and
rustling
i
have
never
seen
such
a
pleasant
cheerful
bedroom
before
uncle
looked
across
at
the
grandmamma
i
have
been
thinking
he
said
to
her
that
if
you
were
willing
to
agree
to
it
your
little
granddaughter
might
remain
up
here
and
i
am
sure
she
would
grow
stronger
you
have
brought
up
all
kinds
of
shawls
and
covers
with
you
and
we
could
make
up
a
soft
bed
out
of
them
and
as
to
looking
after
the
child
you
need
have
no
fear
for
i
will
see
to
that
clara
and
heidi
were
as
overjoyed
at
these
words
as
if
they
were
two
birds
let
out
of
their
cages
and
grandmamma
face
beamed
with
satisfaction
you
are
indeed
kind
my
dear
uncle
she
exclaimed
i
was
just
thinking
myself
that
a
stay
up
here
might
be
the
very
thing
she
wanted
but
then
the
trouble
the
inconvenience
to
yourself
and
you
speak
of
nursing
and
looking
after
her
as
if
it
were
a
mere
nothing
i
thank
you
sincerely
i
thank
you
from
my
whole
heart
uncle
and
she
took
his
hand
and
gave
it
a
long
and
grateful
shake
which
he
returned
with
a
pleased
expression
of
countenance
uncle
immediately
set
to
work
to
get
things
ready
he
carried
clara
back
to
her
chair
outside
heidi
following
not
knowing
how
to
jump
high
enough
into
the
air
to
express
her
contentment
then
he
gathered
up
a
whole
pile
of
shawls
and
furs
and
said
smiling
it
is
a
good
thing
that
grandmamma
came
up
well
provided
for
a
winter
campaign
we
shall
be
able
to
make
good
use
of
these
the
two
had
meanwhile
ascended
to
the
and
begun
to
prepare
a
bed
there
were
so
many
articles
piled
one
over
the
other
that
when
finished
it
looked
like
a
regular
little
fortress
grandmamma
passed
her
hand
carefully
over
it
to
make
sure
that
there
were
no
bits
of
hay
sticking
out
if
there
a
bit
that
can
come
through
it
will
she
said
the
soft
mattress
however
was
so
smooth
and
thick
that
nothing
could
penetrate
it
then
they
went
down
again
well
satisfied
and
found
the
children
laughing
and
talking
together
and
arranging
all
they
were
going
to
do
from
morning
till
evening
as
long
as
clara
stayed
the
next
question
was
how
long
she
was
to
remain
and
first
grandmamma
was
asked
but
she
referred
them
to
the
grandfather
who
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
she
ought
to
make
trial
of
the
mountain
air
for
at
least
a
month
the
children
clapped
their
hands
for
joy
for
they
had
not
expected
to
be
together
for
so
long
a
time
the
bearers
and
the
horse
and
guide
were
now
seen
approaching
the
former
were
sent
back
at
once
and
grandmamma
prepared
to
mount
for
her
return
journey
it
not
saying
grandmamma
clara
called
out
for
you
will
come
up
now
and
then
and
see
how
we
are
getting
on
and
we
shall
so
look
forward
to
your
visits
grandmamma
mounted
her
sturdy
animal
and
uncle
took
the
bridle
to
lead
her
down
the
steep
mountain
path
she
begged
him
not
to
come
far
with
her
but
he
insisted
on
seeing
her
safely
as
far
as
doerfli
for
the
way
was
precipitous
and
not
without
danger
for
the
rider
he
said
grandmamma
did
not
care
to
stay
alone
in
doerfli
and
therefore
decided
to
return
to
ragatz
and
thence
to
make
excursions
up
the
mountain
from
time
to
time
illustration
peter
came
down
with
his
goats
before
uncle
had
returned
as
soon
as
the
animals
caught
sight
of
heidi
they
all
came
flocking
towards
her
and
she
as
well
as
clara
on
her
couch
were
soon
surrounded
by
the
goats
pushing
and
poking
their
heads
one
over
the
other
while
heidi
introduced
each
in
turn
by
its
name
to
her
friend
clara
it
was
not
long
before
the
latter
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
little
snowflake
the
lively
greenfinch
and
the
goats
belonging
to
grandfather
as
well
as
of
the
many
others
including
the
grand
turk
peter
meanwhile
stood
apart
looking
on
and
casting
somewhat
unfriendly
glances
towards
clara
when
the
two
children
called
out
peter
he
made
no
answer
but
swung
his
stick
angrily
as
if
wanting
to
cut
the
air
in
two
and
then
ran
off
with
his
goats
after
him
the
climax
to
all
the
beautiful
things
that
clara
had
already
seen
upon
the
mountain
came
at
the
close
of
the
day
as
she
lay
on
the
large
soft
bed
in
the
hay
loft
with
heidi
near
her
she
looked
out
through
the
round
open
window
right
into
the
middle
of
the
shining
clusters
of
stars
and
she
exclaimed
in
delight
heidi
it
just
as
if
we
were
in
a
high
carriage
and
were
going
to
drive
straight
into
heaven
yes
and
do
you
know
why
the
stars
are
so
happy
and
look
down
and
nod
to
us
like
that
asked
heidi
no
why
is
it
clara
asked
in
return
because
they
live
up
in
heaven
and
know
how
well
god
arranges
everything
for
us
so
that
we
need
have
no
more
fear
or
trouble
and
may
be
quite
sure
that
all
things
will
come
right
in
the
end
but
then
we
must
never
forget
to
pray
and
to
ask
god
to
remember
us
when
he
is
arranging
things
so
that
we
too
may
feel
safe
and
have
no
anxiety
about
what
is
going
to
happen
the
two
children
now
sat
up
and
said
their
prayers
and
then
heidi
put
her
head
down
on
her
little
round
arm
and
fell
off
to
sleep
at
once
but
clara
lay
awake
some
time
for
she
could
not
get
over
the
wonder
of
this
new
experience
of
being
in
bed
up
here
among
the
stars
she
had
indeed
seldom
seen
a
star
for
she
never
went
outside
the
house
at
night
and
the
curtains
at
home
were
always
drawn
before
the
stars
came
out
each
time
she
closed
her
eyes
she
felt
she
must
open
them
again
to
see
if
the
two
very
large
stars
were
still
looking
in
and
nodding
to
her
as
heidi
said
they
did
there
they
were
always
in
the
same
place
at
last
her
eyes
closed
of
their
own
accord
and
it
was
only
in
her
dreams
that
she
still
saw
the
two
large
friendly
stars
shining
down
upon
her
chapter
xxi
happy
days
for
the
little
visitor
next
morning
at
sunrise
went
softly
up
the
ladder
to
see
if
the
children
were
awake
yet
clara
had
just
opened
her
eyes
and
was
looking
with
wonder
at
the
bright
sunlight
that
shone
through
the
round
window
and
danced
and
sparkled
about
her
bed
she
could
not
at
first
think
where
she
was
until
she
caught
sight
of
heidi
sleeping
beside
her
and
heard
the
grandfather
cheery
voice
asking
her
if
she
had
slept
well
she
assured
him
that
when
she
had
once
fallen
asleep
she
had
not
opened
her
eyes
again
all
night
the
grandfather
was
satisfied
at
this
and
immediately
began
to
help
her
dress
with
so
much
gentleness
and
understanding
that
it
seemed
as
if
his
chief
calling
had
been
to
look
after
sick
children
when
heidi
awoke
she
was
surprised
to
see
clara
dressed
and
already
in
the
grandfather
arms
ready
to
be
carried
down
she
hurried
up
too
and
soon
ran
down
the
ladder
and
out
of
the
hut
and
there
further
astonishment
awaited
her
for
grandfather
had
been
busy
the
night
before
after
they
were
in
bed
seeing
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
clara
chair
through
the
he
had
taken
down
two
of
the
boards
at
the
side
of
the
shed
and
made
an
opening
large
enough
to
admit
the
chair
these
he
left
loose
so
that
they
could
be
taken
away
and
put
up
at
pleasure
he
was
at
this
moment
wheeling
clara
out
into
the
sun
he
left
her
in
front
of
the
hut
while
he
went
to
look
after
the
goats
and
heidi
ran
up
to
her
friend
o
heidi
if
only
i
could
stay
up
here
for
ever
with
you
exclaimed
clara
happily
turning
in
her
chair
from
side
to
side
that
she
might
drink
in
the
air
and
sun
from
all
quarters
now
you
see
that
it
is
just
what
i
told
you
replied
heidi
delighted
that
it
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
to
be
up
here
with
grandfather
the
latter
at
that
moment
appeared
coming
from
the
goat
shed
and
bringing
two
small
foaming
bowls
of
milk
one
for
clara
and
one
for
heidi
that
will
do
the
little
daughter
good
he
said
nodding
to
clara
it
is
from
little
swan
and
will
make
her
strong
to
your
health
child
drink
it
up
clara
had
never
tasted
goat
milk
before
she
hesitated
and
smelt
it
before
putting
it
to
her
lips
but
seeing
how
heidi
drank
hers
up
without
hesitating
and
how
much
she
seemed
to
like
it
clara
did
the
same
and
drank
till
there
was
not
a
drop
left
for
she
too
found
it
delicious
tasting
just
as
if
sugar
and
cinnamon
had
been
mixed
with
it
tomorrow
we
will
drink
two
said
the
grandfather
who
had
looked
on
with
satisfaction
at
seeing
her
follow
heidi
example
when
peter
arrived
with
the
goats
uncle
drew
him
aside
and
said
from
today
be
sure
you
let
little
swan
go
where
she
likes
she
knows
where
to
find
the
best
food
for
herself
and
so
if
she
wants
to
climb
higher
you
follow
her
and
it
will
do
the
others
no
harm
if
they
go
too
a
little
more
climbing
wo
hurt
you
and
in
this
matter
she
probably
knows
better
than
you
what
is
good
for
her
i
want
her
to
give
as
fine
milk
as
possible
so
now
be
off
and
remember
what
i
say
and
do
look
so
cross
about
it
peter
was
accustomed
to
give
immediate
obedience
to
uncle
and
he
marched
off
with
his
goats
but
with
a
turn
of
the
head
and
roll
of
the
eye
that
showed
he
had
some
thought
in
reserve
the
goats
carried
heidi
along
with
them
a
little
way
which
was
what
peter
wanted
you
will
have
to
come
with
them
he
called
to
her
for
i
shall
be
obliged
to
follow
little
swan
illustration
a
procession
was
making
its
way
up
the
mountain
i
can
not
heidi
called
back
from
the
midst
of
her
friends
and
i
shall
not
be
able
to
come
for
a
long
long
time
not
as
long
as
clara
is
with
me
grandfather
however
has
promised
to
go
up
the
mountain
with
both
of
us
some
day
as
heidi
ran
back
to
clara
peter
doubled
his
fists
and
made
threatening
gestures
towards
the
invalid
on
her
couch
and
then
climbed
up
some
distance
without
pause
until
he
was
out
of
sight
for
he
was
afraid
uncle
might
have
seen
him
clara
and
heidi
had
made
so
many
plans
for
themselves
that
they
hardly
knew
where
to
begin
heidi
suggested
that
they
should
first
write
to
grandmamma
to
whom
they
had
promised
to
send
word
every
day
for
grandmamma
had
not
felt
sure
whether
it
would
in
the
long
run
suit
clara
health
to
remain
up
the
mountain
with
daily
news
of
her
granddaughter
she
could
stay
on
without
anxiety
at
ragatz
and
yet
be
ready
to
go
to
clara
at
a
moment
notice
must
we
go
indoors
to
write
asked
clara
it
is
so
much
nicer
out
here
so
heidi
ran
in
and
brought
out
her
and
writing
things
and
her
own
little
stool
she
put
her
reading
book
and
copy
book
on
clara
knees
to
make
a
desk
for
her
to
write
upon
and
she
herself
took
her
seat
on
the
stool
by
the
bench
and
then
they
both
began
writing
to
grandmamma
but
clara
paused
after
every
sentence
to
look
about
her
it
was
too
beautiful
for
much
letter
writing
the
breeze
had
sunk
a
little
and
now
only
gently
fanned
her
face
and
whispered
lightly
through
the
fir
trees
now
and
again
the
call
of
some
rang
out
through
the
air
and
the
echo
answered
softly
from
the
rocks
thus
the
morning
passed
the
children
hardly
knew
how
and
soon
grandfather
came
with
the
bowls
of
steaming
milk
then
heidi
pushed
clara
chair
under
the
fir
trees
where
they
spent
the
afternoon
in
the
shade
telling
each
other
all
that
had
happened
since
last
they
met
so
the
hours
flew
by
and
all
at
once
as
it
seemed
the
evening
had
come
with
the
returning
peter
who
still
scowled
and
looked
angry
illustration
peter
called
out
heidi
as
she
saw
he
had
no
intention
of
stopping
to
speak
peter
called
out
clara
in
a
friendly
voice
peter
took
no
notice
and
went
surlily
on
with
his
goats
as
clara
saw
the
grandfather
leading
away
little
swan
to
milk
her
she
was
suddenly
taken
with
a
longing
for
another
bowlful
of
the
fragrant
milk
and
waited
impatiently
for
it
is
it
curious
heidi
she
said
astonished
at
herself
as
long
as
i
can
remember
i
have
only
eaten
because
i
was
obliged
to
and
everything
used
to
seem
to
taste
of
cod
liver
oil
and
i
was
always
wishing
there
was
no
need
to
eat
or
drink
and
now
i
am
longing
for
grandfather
to
bring
me
the
milk
yes
i
know
what
it
feels
like
replied
heidi
who
remembered
the
many
days
in
frankfurt
when
all
her
food
used
to
seem
to
stick
in
her
throat
when
grandfather
at
last
brought
the
evening
milk
clara
drank
it
up
so
quickly
that
she
had
emptied
her
bowl
before
heidi
and
then
she
asked
for
a
little
more
the
grandfather
went
inside
with
both
the
children
bowls
and
when
he
brought
them
out
again
full
he
had
something
else
to
add
to
their
supper
he
had
walked
over
that
afternoon
to
a
herdsman
house
where
the
butter
was
made
and
had
brought
home
a
large
pat
some
of
which
he
had
now
spread
thickly
on
two
good
slices
of
bread
that
night
when
clara
lay
down
in
her
bed
and
prepared
to
watch
the
stars
her
eyes
would
not
keep
open
and
she
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
heidi
and
slept
soundly
all
night
a
thing
she
never
remembered
having
done
before
the
following
day
and
the
day
after
passed
in
the
same
pleasant
fashion
and
the
third
day
there
came
a
surprise
for
the
children
two
stout
porters
came
up
the
mountain
each
carrying
a
bed
on
his
shoulders
with
bedding
of
all
kinds
and
two
beautiful
new
white
coverlids
the
men
also
had
a
letter
with
them
from
grandmamma
in
which
she
said
that
these
were
for
clara
and
heidi
and
that
heidi
in
future
was
always
to
sleep
in
a
proper
bed
and
when
she
went
down
to
doerfli
in
the
winter
she
was
to
take
one
with
her
and
leave
the
other
at
the
hut
so
that
clara
might
always
know
there
was
a
bed
ready
for
her
when
she
paid
a
visit
to
the
mountain
she
went
on
to
thank
the
children
for
their
long
letters
and
encouraged
them
to
continue
writing
daily
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
picture
all
they
were
doing
grandfather
went
up
the
ladder
and
threw
back
the
hay
from
bed
on
to
the
great
heap
and
soon
the
beds
were
put
up
close
to
one
another
so
that
the
children
might
still
be
able
to
see
out
of
the
window
for
he
knew
what
pleasure
they
had
in
the
light
from
the
sun
and
stars
meanwhile
grandmamma
down
at
ragatz
was
rejoicing
at
the
excellent
news
of
the
invalid
which
reached
her
daily
from
the
mountain
clara
found
the
life
more
charming
each
day
and
could
not
say
enough
of
the
kindness
and
care
which
the
grandfather
lavished
upon
her
nor
of
heidi
lively
and
amusing
companionship
having
such
fresh
assurances
each
day
that
all
was
going
well
with
clara
grandmamma
thought
she
might
put
off
her
visit
to
the
children
a
little
longer
for
the
steep
ride
up
and
down
was
somewhat
of
a
fatigue
to
her
the
grandfather
seemed
to
feel
an
especial
sympathy
for
his
little
invalid
charge
for
he
tried
to
think
of
something
fresh
every
day
to
help
forward
her
recovery
he
climbed
up
the
mountain
every
afternoon
higher
and
higher
each
day
and
came
home
in
the
evening
with
large
bunches
of
leaves
which
scented
the
air
with
a
mingled
fragrance
as
of
carnations
and
thyme
he
hung
them
up
in
the
goat
shed
for
little
swan
to
eat
so
that
she
might
give
extra
fine
milk
clara
had
now
been
on
the
mountain
for
three
weeks
for
some
days
past
the
grandfather
each
morning
after
carrying
her
down
had
said
the
little
daughter
try
if
she
can
stand
for
a
minute
or
two
and
clara
had
made
the
effort
in
order
to
please
him
but
had
clung
to
him
as
soon
as
her
feet
touched
the
ground
exclaiming
that
it
hurt
her
so
he
let
her
try
a
little
longer
however
each
day
it
was
many
years
since
they
had
had
such
a
splendid
summer
among
the
mountains
day
after
day
there
were
the
same
cloudless
sky
and
brilliant
sun
the
flowers
opened
wide
their
fragrant
blossoms
and
everywhere
the
eye
was
greeted
with
a
glow
of
color
and
when
the
evening
came
the
crimson
light
fell
on
mountain
peaks
and
on
the
great
till
at
last
the
sun
sank
in
a
sea
of
golden
flame
heidi
never
tired
of
telling
clara
of
the
beauty
of
the
spot
on
the
higher
slope
of
the
mountain
where
the
bright
golden
grew
in
masses
and
the
blue
flowers
were
in
such
numbers
that
the
very
grass
seemed
to
have
turned
blue
an
irrepressible
longing
came
over
her
to
see
it
all
once
more
she
ran
to
her
grandfather
who
was
in
the
shed
calling
out
almost
before
she
was
inside
grandfather
will
you
take
us
out
with
the
goats
tomorrow
oh
it
is
so
lovely
up
there
now
very
well
he
answered
but
if
i
do
little
clara
must
do
something
to
please
me
she
must
try
her
best
again
this
evening
to
stand
on
her
feet
heidi
ran
back
with
the
good
news
to
clara
and
the
latter
promised
to
try
her
very
best
as
the
grandfather
wished
for
she
looked
forward
immensely
to
the
next
day
excursion
heidi
was
so
pleased
and
excited
that
she
called
out
to
peter
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
him
that
evening
peter
peter
we
are
all
coming
out
with
you
tomorrow
and
are
going
to
stay
up
there
the
whole
day
peter
cross
as
a
bear
grumbled
some
reply
and
lifted
his
stick
to
give
greenfinch
a
blow
for
no
reason
in
particular
but
greenfinch
saw
the
movement
and
with
a
leap
over
snowflake
back
she
got
out
of
the
way
and
the
stick
only
hit
the
air
clara
and
heidi
got
into
their
two
fine
beds
that
night
full
of
delightful
anticipation
of
the
morrow
they
were
so
full
of
their
plans
that
they
agreed
to
keep
awake
all
night
and
talk
over
them
but
their
heads
had
no
sooner
touched
their
soft
pillows
than
the
conversation
suddenly
ceased
and
clara
fell
into
a
dream
of
an
immense
field
which
looked
the
color
of
the
sky
so
thickly
inlaid
was
it
with
blue
flowers
and
heidi
heard
the
great
bird
of
prey
calling
to
her
from
the
heights
above
come
come
come
chapter
xxii
wicked
peter
and
the
unlucky
chair
uncle
went
out
early
the
next
morning
to
see
what
kind
of
a
day
it
was
going
to
be
there
was
a
reddish
gold
light
over
the
higher
peaks
a
light
breeze
was
springing
up
and
the
branches
of
the
fir
trees
moved
gently
to
and
fro
the
sun
was
on
its
way
he
wheeled
the
chair
out
of
the
shed
ready
for
the
coming
journey
and
then
went
in
to
call
the
children
and
tell
them
what
a
lovely
sunrise
it
was
peter
came
up
the
mountain
at
this
moment
the
goats
did
not
gather
round
him
so
trustfully
as
usual
but
seemed
to
avoid
him
timidly
for
he
had
reached
a
high
pitch
of
anger
and
bitterness
and
was
using
his
stick
very
unnecessarily
and
where
it
fell
the
blow
was
no
light
one
for
weeks
now
he
had
not
had
heidi
all
to
himself
as
formerly
when
he
came
up
in
the
morning
the
invalid
child
was
always
already
in
her
chair
and
heidi
fully
occupied
with
her
and
it
was
the
same
thing
over
again
when
he
came
down
in
the
evening
she
had
not
come
out
with
the
goats
once
this
summer
and
today
she
was
only
coming
in
company
with
her
friend
and
the
chair
and
would
stick
by
the
side
the
whole
time
it
was
the
thought
of
this
which
was
making
him
particularly
cross
this
morning
there
stood
the
chair
on
its
high
wheels
peter
glared
at
it
as
at
an
enemy
that
had
done
him
harm
and
was
likely
to
do
him
still
more
today
he
glanced
round
there
was
no
sound
anywhere
no
one
to
see
him
he
sprang
forward
like
a
wild
creature
caught
hold
of
the
chair
and
gave
it
a
violent
and
angry
push
in
the
direction
of
the
slope
it
rolled
swiftly
forward
and
in
another
minute
had
disappeared
illustration
peter
now
sped
up
the
mountain
as
if
on
wings
not
pausing
till
he
was
well
hidden
behind
a
large
blackberry
bush
for
he
had
no
wish
to
be
seen
by
uncle
but
he
was
anxious
to
see
what
had
become
of
the
chair
so
he
looked
and
there
he
saw
his
enemy
running
faster
and
faster
down
hill
then
it
turned
head
over
heels
several
times
and
finally
after
one
great
bound
rolled
over
and
over
to
its
complete
destruction
the
pieces
flew
in
every
direction
feet
arms
and
torn
fragments
of
the
padded
seat
and
bolster
and
peter
experienced
a
feeling
of
such
unbounded
delight
at
the
sight
that
he
leapt
in
the
air
laughing
aloud
and
stamping
for
joy
he
could
see
only
good
results
for
himself
in
the
disaster
to
his
enemy
now
heidi
friend
would
be
obliged
to
go
away
for
she
would
have
no
means
of
going
about
and
when
heidi
was
alone
again
she
would
come
out
with
him
as
in
the
old
days
and
everything
would
go
on
in
the
proper
way
but
peter
did
not
consider
or
did
not
know
that
when
we
do
a
wrong
thing
trouble
is
sure
to
follow
heidi
now
came
running
out
of
the
hut
and
round
the
shed
grandfather
was
behind
with
clara
in
his
arms
the
shed
stood
wide
open
the
two
loose
planks
having
been
taken
down
and
it
was
quite
light
inside
heidi
looked
into
every
corner
and
ran
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
then
stood
still
wondering
what
could
have
happened
to
the
chair
grandfather
now
came
up
how
is
this
have
you
wheeled
the
chair
away
heidi
i
have
been
looking
everywhere
for
it
grandfather
you
said
it
was
standing
ready
outside
and
she
again
searched
each
corner
of
the
shed
with
her
eyes
at
that
moment
the
wind
which
had
risen
suddenly
blew
open
the
shed
door
and
sent
it
banging
back
against
the
wall
it
must
have
been
the
wind
grandfather
exclaimed
heidi
and
her
eyes
grew
anxious
at
this
sudden
discovery
oh
if
it
has
blown
the
chair
all
the
way
down
to
doerfli
we
shall
not
get
it
back
in
time
and
shall
not
be
able
to
go
if
it
has
rolled
as
far
as
that
it
will
never
come
back
for
it
is
in
a
hundred
pieces
by
now
said
the
grandfather
going
round
the
corner
and
looking
down
but
it
a
curious
thing
to
have
happened
he
added
as
he
thought
over
the
matter
for
the
chair
would
have
had
to
turn
a
corner
before
starting
down
hill
oh
i
am
sorry
lamented
clara
for
we
shall
not
be
able
to
go
today
or
perhaps
any
other
day
i
shall
have
to
go
home
i
suppose
if
i
have
no
chair
oh
i
am
so
sorry
i
am
so
sorry
but
heidi
looked
towards
her
grandfather
with
her
usual
expression
of
confidence
grandfather
you
will
be
able
to
do
something
wo
you
so
that
it
need
not
be
as
clara
says
and
so
that
she
is
not
obliged
to
go
home
well
for
the
present
we
will
go
up
the
mountain
as
we
had
arranged
and
then
later
on
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
he
answered
much
to
the
children
delight
he
went
indoors
carried
out
a
pile
of
shawls
and
laying
them
on
the
sunniest
spot
he
could
find
set
clara
down
upon
them
then
he
brought
the
children
morning
milk
and
led
out
his
two
goats
why
is
peter
not
here
yet
thought
uncle
to
himself
for
whistle
had
not
been
sounded
that
morning
the
grandfather
then
took
clara
up
on
one
arm
and
the
shawls
on
the
other
now
then
we
will
start
he
said
the
goats
can
come
with
us
heidi
was
pleased
at
this
and
walked
on
after
her
grandfather
with
an
arm
over
either
of
the
goats
necks
and
the
animals
were
so
overjoyed
to
have
her
again
that
they
nearly
squeezed
her
flat
between
them
out
of
sheer
affection
when
they
reached
the
spot
where
the
goats
usually
pastured
they
were
surprised
to
find
them
already
feeding
there
climbing
about
the
rocks
and
peter
with
them
lying
his
full
length
on
the
ground
i
teach
you
another
time
to
go
by
like
that
you
lazy
rascal
what
do
you
mean
by
it
uncle
called
to
him
peter
recognizing
the
voice
jumped
up
like
a
shot
no
one
was
up
he
answered
have
you
seen
anything
of
the
chair
asked
the
grandfather
of
what
chair
called
peter
back
in
answer
in
a
morose
tone
of
voice
uncle
said
no
more
he
spread
the
shawls
on
the
sunny
slope
and
setting
clara
upon
them
asked
if
she
was
comfortable
as
comfortable
as
in
my
chair
she
said
thanking
him
and
this
seems
the
most
beautiful
spot
o
heidi
it
is
lovely
it
is
lovely
she
cried
looking
round
her
with
delight
the
grandfather
prepared
to
leave
them
they
would
now
be
safe
and
happy
together
he
said
and
when
it
was
time
for
dinner
heidi
was
to
go
and
bring
the
bag
from
the
shady
hollow
where
he
had
put
it
peter
was
to
get
them
as
much
milk
as
they
wanted
but
heidi
was
to
see
that
it
was
little
swan
milk
he
would
come
for
them
towards
evening
he
must
now
be
off
to
see
after
the
chair
and
find
out
what
had
become
of
it
the
sky
was
dark
blue
and
not
a
single
cloud
was
to
be
seen
from
one
horizon
to
the
other
the
great
snowfield
overhead
sparkled
as
if
set
with
thousands
and
thousands
of
gold
and
silver
stars
now
and
again
a
young
goat
came
and
lay
down
beside
them
snowflake
came
oftenest
putting
her
little
head
down
near
heidi
and
only
moving
because
another
goat
came
and
drove
her
away
and
the
goats
had
also
grown
familiar
with
clara
and
would
rub
their
heads
against
her
shoulder
which
was
always
a
sign
of
acquaintanceship
and
goodwill
some
hours
went
by
and
heidi
began
to
think
that
she
might
just
go
over
to
the
spot
where
all
the
flowers
grew
to
see
if
they
were
fully
blown
and
looking
as
lovely
as
the
year
before
clara
could
not
go
until
grandfather
came
back
that
evening
when
the
flowers
probably
would
be
already
closed
the
longing
to
go
became
stronger
and
stronger
till
heidi
felt
she
could
not
resist
it
would
you
think
me
unkind
clara
she
said
rather
hesitatingly
if
i
left
you
for
a
few
minutes
i
could
run
there
and
back
very
quickly
i
want
so
to
see
how
the
flowers
are
looking
but
wait
for
an
idea
had
come
into
heidi
head
she
ran
and
picked
a
bunch
or
two
of
green
leaves
and
then
took
hold
of
snowflake
and
led
her
up
to
clara
illustration
there
now
you
will
not
be
alone
said
heidi
giving
the
goat
a
little
push
to
show
her
she
was
to
lie
down
near
clara
which
the
animal
quite
understood
heidi
threw
the
leaves
into
clara
lap
and
the
latter
told
her
friend
to
go
at
once
to
look
at
the
flowers
as
she
was
quite
happy
to
be
left
with
the
goat
she
liked
this
new
experience
heidi
ran
off
and
clara
began
to
hold
out
the
leaves
one
by
one
to
snowflake
who
snuggled
up
to
her
new
friend
in
a
confiding
manner
and
slowly
ate
the
leaves
from
her
hand
she
found
a
strange
new
pleasure
in
sitting
all
alone
like
this
on
the
mountain
side
her
only
companion
a
little
goat
that
looked
to
her
for
protection
she
suddenly
felt
a
great
desire
to
be
her
own
mistress
and
to
be
able
to
help
others
instead
of
herself
being
always
dependent
as
she
was
now
many
thoughts
unknown
to
her
before
came
crowding
into
her
mind
and
a
longing
to
go
on
living
in
the
sunshine
and
to
be
doing
something
that
would
bring
happiness
to
another
as
now
she
was
helping
to
make
the
goat
happy
an
unaccustomed
feeling
of
joy
took
possession
of
her
as
if
everything
she
had
ever
known
or
felt
became
all
at
once
more
beautiful
and
she
seemed
to
see
all
things
in
a
new
light
and
so
strong
was
the
sense
of
this
new
beauty
and
happiness
that
she
threw
her
arms
round
the
little
goat
neck
and
exclaimed
o
snowflake
how
delightful
it
is
up
here
if
only
i
could
stay
on
for
ever
with
you
beside
me
heidi
had
meanwhile
reached
her
field
of
flowers
and
as
she
caught
sight
of
it
she
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
the
whole
ground
in
front
of
her
was
a
mass
of
shimmering
gold
where
the
cistus
flowers
spread
their
yellow
blossoms
above
them
waved
whole
bushes
of
the
deep
flowers
heidi
stood
and
gazed
and
drew
in
the
delicious
air
suddenly
she
turned
round
and
reached
clara
side
out
of
breath
with
running
and
excitement
oh
you
must
come
she
called
out
as
soon
as
she
came
in
sight
it
is
more
beautiful
than
you
can
imagine
and
perhaps
this
evening
it
may
not
be
so
lovely
i
believe
i
could
carry
you
do
you
think
i
could
clara
looked
at
her
and
shook
her
head
why
heidi
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
you
are
smaller
than
i
am
oh
if
only
i
could
walk
heidi
looked
round
as
if
in
search
of
something
some
new
idea
had
evidently
come
into
her
head
peter
was
sitting
up
above
looking
down
on
the
two
children
he
had
been
sitting
and
staring
before
him
in
the
same
way
for
hours
as
if
he
could
not
make
out
what
he
saw
he
had
destroyed
the
chair
so
that
the
friend
might
not
be
able
to
move
anywhere
and
that
her
visit
might
come
to
an
end
and
then
a
little
while
after
she
had
appeared
right
up
here
under
his
very
nose
with
heidi
beside
her
he
thought
his
eyes
must
deceive
him
and
yet
there
she
was
and
no
mistake
about
it
heidi
looked
up
to
where
he
was
sitting
and
called
out
in
a
commanding
voice
peter
come
down
here
i
do
wish
to
come
he
called
in
reply
but
you
must
i
can
not
do
it
alone
and
you
must
come
here
and
help
me
make
haste
and
come
down
she
called
again
in
an
urgent
voice
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
was
the
answer
heidi
ran
some
way
up
the
slope
towards
him
and
then
pausing
called
again
her
eyes
ablaze
with
anger
if
you
do
come
at
once
peter
i
will
do
something
to
you
that
you
wo
like
i
mean
what
i
say
peter
felt
an
inward
throe
at
these
words
and
a
great
fear
seized
him
he
had
done
something
wicked
which
he
wanted
no
one
to
know
about
and
so
far
he
had
thought
himself
safe
but
now
heidi
spoke
exactly
as
if
she
knew
everything
and
whatever
she
did
know
she
would
tell
her
grandfather
and
there
was
no
one
he
feared
so
much
as
this
latter
person
supposing
he
were
to
suspect
what
had
happened
about
the
chair
peter
anguish
of
mind
grew
more
acute
he
stood
up
and
went
down
to
where
heidi
was
awaiting
him
i
am
coming
and
you
wo
do
what
you
said
peter
appeared
now
so
submissive
with
fear
that
heidi
felt
quite
sorry
for
him
and
answered
assuringly
no
no
of
course
not
come
along
with
me
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
in
what
i
want
you
to
do
as
soon
as
they
got
to
clara
heidi
gave
her
orders
peter
was
to
take
hold
of
her
under
the
arms
on
one
side
and
she
on
the
other
and
together
they
were
to
lift
her
up
this
first
movement
was
successfully
carried
through
but
then
came
the
difficulty
as
clara
could
not
even
stand
how
were
they
to
support
her
and
get
her
along
heidi
was
too
small
for
her
arm
to
serve
clara
to
lean
upon
you
must
put
one
arm
well
round
my
neck
so
and
put
the
other
through
peter
and
lean
firmly
upon
it
then
we
shall
be
able
to
carry
you
peter
however
had
never
given
his
arm
to
any
one
in
his
life
clara
put
hers
in
his
but
he
kept
his
own
hanging
down
straight
beside
him
like
a
stick
that
not
the
way
peter
said
heidi
in
an
authoritative
voice
you
must
put
your
arm
out
in
the
shape
of
a
ring
and
clara
must
put
hers
through
it
and
lean
her
weight
upon
you
and
whatever
you
do
do
let
your
arm
give
way
like
that
i
am
sure
we
shall
be
able
to
manage
peter
did
as
he
was
told
but
still
they
did
not
get
on
very
well
clara
was
not
such
a
light
weight
and
the
team
did
not
match
very
well
in
size
it
was
up
one
side
and
down
the
other
so
that
the
supports
were
rather
wabbly
clara
tried
to
use
her
own
feet
a
little
but
each
time
drew
them
quickly
back
put
your
foot
down
firmly
once
suggested
heidi
i
am
sure
it
will
hurt
you
less
after
that
do
you
think
so
said
clara
hesitatingly
but
she
followed
advice
and
ventured
one
firm
step
on
the
ground
and
then
another
she
called
out
a
little
as
she
did
it
then
she
lifted
her
foot
again
and
went
on
oh
that
was
less
painful
already
she
exclaimed
joyfully
illustration
the
little
invalid
finds
that
she
is
able
to
walk
try
again
said
heidi
encouragingly
and
clara
went
on
putting
one
foot
out
after
another
until
all
at
once
she
called
out
i
can
do
it
heidi
look
look
i
can
make
proper
steps
and
heidi
cried
out
with
even
greater
delight
can
you
really
make
steps
can
you
really
walk
really
walk
by
yourself
oh
if
only
grandfather
were
here
and
she
continued
gleefully
to
exclaim
you
can
walk
now
clara
you
can
walk
clara
still
held
on
firmly
to
her
supports
but
with
every
step
she
felt
safer
on
her
feet
as
all
three
became
aware
and
heidi
was
beside
herself
with
joy
now
we
shall
be
able
to
come
up
here
together
every
day
and
just
go
where
we
like
and
you
will
be
able
to
walk
about
as
i
do
and
not
have
to
be
pushed
in
a
chair
and
will
get
quite
strong
and
well
it
is
the
greatest
happiness
we
could
have
had
and
clara
heartily
agreed
for
she
could
think
of
no
greater
joy
in
the
world
than
to
be
strong
and
able
to
go
about
like
other
people
and
no
longer
to
have
to
lie
from
day
to
day
in
her
invalid
chair
they
had
not
far
to
go
to
reach
the
field
of
flowers
and
could
already
catch
sight
of
the
cistus
flowers
glowing
gold
in
the
sun
as
they
came
to
the
bushes
of
the
flowers
with
sunny
inviting
patches
of
warm
ground
between
them
clara
said
ca
we
sit
down
here
for
a
while
this
was
just
what
heidi
enjoyed
and
so
the
children
sat
down
in
the
midst
of
the
flowers
clara
for
the
first
time
on
the
dry
warm
mountain
grass
and
she
found
it
indescribably
delightful
everything
was
so
lovely
so
lovely
and
heidi
who
was
beside
her
thought
she
had
never
seen
it
so
perfectly
beautiful
up
here
before
then
she
suddenly
remembered
that
clara
was
cured
that
was
the
crowning
delight
of
all
that
made
life
so
delightful
in
the
midst
of
all
this
surrounding
beauty
clara
sat
silent
overcome
with
the
enchantment
of
all
that
her
eye
rested
upon
and
with
the
anticipation
of
all
the
happiness
that
was
now
before
her
there
seemed
hardly
room
in
her
heart
for
all
her
joyful
emotions
peter
also
lay
among
the
flowers
without
moving
or
speaking
for
he
was
fast
asleep
the
breeze
came
blowing
softly
and
caressingly
from
behind
the
sheltering
rocks
and
passed
whisperingly
through
the
bushes
overhead
heidi
got
up
now
and
then
to
run
about
for
the
flowers
waving
in
the
warm
wind
seemed
to
smell
sweeter
and
to
grow
more
thickly
whichever
way
she
went
so
the
hours
went
by
it
was
long
past
noon
when
a
small
troop
of
goats
advanced
solemnly
towards
the
plain
of
flowers
it
was
not
a
feeding
place
of
theirs
for
they
did
not
care
to
graze
on
flowers
they
looked
like
an
embassy
arriving
with
greenfinch
as
their
leader
they
had
evidently
come
in
search
of
their
companions
who
had
left
them
in
the
lurch
and
who
had
remained
away
so
long
for
the
goats
could
tell
the
time
without
mistake
as
soon
as
greenfinch
caught
sight
of
the
three
missing
friends
amid
the
flowers
she
set
up
an
extra
loud
bleat
whereupon
all
the
others
joined
in
a
chorus
of
bleats
and
the
whole
company
came
trotting
towards
the
children
peter
woke
up
rubbing
his
eyes
for
he
had
been
dreaming
that
he
saw
the
chair
again
with
its
beautiful
red
padding
standing
whole
and
uninjured
before
the
grandfather
door
he
experienced
again
the
dreadful
fear
of
mind
that
he
had
lost
in
this
dream
of
the
uninjured
chair
even
though
heidi
had
promised
not
to
do
anything
there
still
remained
the
lively
dread
that
his
deed
might
be
found
out
in
some
other
way
he
allowed
heidi
to
do
what
she
liked
with
him
for
he
was
reduced
to
such
a
state
of
low
spirits
and
meekness
that
he
was
ready
to
give
his
help
to
clara
without
murmur
or
resistance
when
all
three
had
got
back
to
their
old
quarters
heidi
ran
and
brought
forward
the
bag
and
proceeded
to
fulfill
her
promise
for
her
threat
of
the
morning
had
been
concerned
with
peter
dinner
she
had
seen
her
grandfather
putting
in
all
sorts
of
good
things
and
had
been
pleased
to
think
of
peter
having
a
large
share
of
them
and
she
had
meant
him
to
understand
when
he
refused
at
first
to
help
her
that
he
would
get
nothing
for
his
dinner
but
peter
conscience
had
put
another
interpretation
upon
her
words
heidi
took
the
food
out
of
the
bag
and
divided
it
into
three
portions
and
each
was
of
such
a
goodly
size
that
she
thought
to
herself
there
will
be
plenty
of
ours
left
for
him
to
have
more
still
she
gave
the
other
two
their
dinners
and
sat
down
with
her
own
beside
clara
and
they
all
three
ate
with
a
good
appetite
after
their
great
exertions
peter
ate
up
every
bit
of
food
to
the
last
crumb
but
there
was
something
wanting
to
his
usual
enjoyment
of
a
good
dinner
for
every
mouthful
he
swallowed
seemed
to
choke
him
and
he
felt
something
gnawing
inside
him
they
were
so
late
at
their
dinner
that
they
had
not
long
to
wait
after
they
had
finished
before
grandfather
came
up
to
get
them
heidi
rushed
forward
to
meet
him
as
soon
as
he
appeared
as
she
wanted
to
be
the
first
to
tell
him
the
good
news
she
was
so
excited
that
she
could
hardly
get
her
words
out
when
she
did
get
up
to
him
but
he
soon
understood
and
a
look
of
extreme
pleasure
came
into
his
face
he
hastened
up
to
where
clara
was
sitting
and
said
with
a
cheerful
smile
so
we
made
the
effort
have
we
and
won
the
day
illustration
we
must
not
overdo
it
he
said
taking
clara
in
his
arms
then
he
lifted
her
up
and
putting
his
left
arm
behind
her
and
giving
her
his
right
to
lean
upon
made
her
walk
a
little
way
which
she
did
with
less
trembling
and
hesitation
than
before
now
that
she
had
such
a
strong
arm
round
her
heidi
skipped
along
beside
her
in
glee
and
the
grandfather
looked
too
as
if
some
happiness
had
befallen
him
we
must
not
overdo
it
he
said
taking
clara
up
in
his
arms
it
is
high
time
we
went
home
and
he
started
off
down
the
mountain
path
for
he
was
anxious
to
get
her
indoors
that
she
might
rest
after
her
unusual
fatigue
when
peter
got
to
doerfli
that
evening
he
found
a
large
group
of
people
collected
round
a
certain
spot
pushing
one
another
and
looking
over
each
other
shoulders
in
their
eagerness
to
catch
sight
of
something
lying
on
the
ground
peter
thought
he
should
like
to
see
too
and
poked
and
elbowed
till
he
made
his
way
through
there
it
lay
the
thing
he
had
wanted
to
see
scattered
about
the
grass
were
the
remains
of
clara
chair
part
of
the
back
and
the
middle
bit
and
enough
of
the
red
padding
and
the
bright
nails
to
show
how
magnificent
the
chair
had
been
when
it
was
entire
i
was
here
when
the
men
passed
carrying
it
up
said
the
baker
who
was
standing
near
peter
i
bet
any
one
that
it
was
worth
dollars
at
least
i
can
not
think
how
such
an
accident
could
have
happened
uncle
said
the
wind
might
perhaps
have
done
it
remarked
one
of
the
women
it
a
good
job
that
no
one
but
the
wind
did
it
said
the
baker
again
or
he
might
smart
for
it
no
doubt
the
gentleman
in
frankfurt
when
he
hears
what
has
happened
will
make
inquiries
about
it
i
am
glad
for
myself
that
i
have
not
been
seen
up
the
mountain
for
a
good
two
years
as
suspicion
is
likely
to
fall
on
any
one
who
was
up
there
at
the
time
many
more
opinions
were
passed
on
the
matter
but
peter
had
heard
enough
he
crept
quietly
away
out
of
the
crowd
and
then
took
to
his
heels
and
ran
up
home
as
fast
as
he
could
as
if
he
thought
some
one
was
after
him
the
baker
words
had
filled
him
with
fear
and
trembling
he
was
sure
now
that
any
day
a
constable
might
come
over
from
frankfurt
and
inquire
about
the
destruction
of
the
chair
and
then
everything
would
come
out
and
he
would
be
seized
and
carried
off
to
frankfurt
and
there
put
in
prison
he
reached
home
in
this
disturbed
state
of
mind
he
would
not
open
his
mouth
in
reply
to
anything
that
was
said
to
him
he
would
not
eat
his
potatoes
all
he
did
was
to
creep
off
to
bed
as
quickly
as
possible
and
hide
under
the
bedclothes
and
groan
peter
has
been
eating
sorrel
again
and
is
evidently
in
pain
by
the
way
he
is
groaning
said
his
mother
you
must
give
him
a
little
more
bread
to
take
with
him
give
him
a
bit
of
mine
tomorrow
said
the
grandmother
sympathizingly
as
the
children
lay
that
night
in
bed
looking
out
at
the
stars
heidi
said
i
have
been
thinking
all
day
what
a
happy
thing
it
is
that
god
does
not
give
us
what
we
ask
for
even
when
we
pray
and
pray
and
pray
if
he
knows
there
is
something
better
for
us
have
you
felt
like
that
why
do
you
ask
me
that
tonight
all
of
a
sudden
asked
clara
because
i
prayed
so
hard
when
i
was
in
frankfurt
that
i
might
go
home
at
once
and
because
i
was
not
allowed
to
i
thought
god
had
forgotten
me
and
now
you
see
if
i
had
come
away
at
first
when
i
wanted
to
you
would
never
have
come
here
and
would
never
have
got
well
clara
had
in
her
turn
become
thoughtful
but
heidi
she
began
again
in
that
case
we
ought
never
to
pray
for
anything
as
god
always
intends
something
better
for
us
than
we
know
or
wish
for
you
must
not
think
it
is
like
that
clara
replied
heidi
eagerly
we
must
go
on
praying
for
everything
so
that
god
may
know
we
do
not
forget
that
it
all
comes
from
him
if
we
forget
god
then
he
lets
us
go
our
own
way
and
we
get
into
trouble
how
did
you
learn
all
that
asked
clara
grandmamma
explained
it
to
me
first
of
all
and
then
when
it
all
happened
just
as
she
said
i
knew
it
myself
and
i
think
clara
she
went
on
as
she
sat
up
in
bed
we
ought
certainly
to
thank
god
tonight
that
you
can
walk
now
and
that
he
has
made
us
so
happy
yes
heidi
i
am
sure
you
are
right
and
i
am
glad
you
reminded
me
i
almost
forgot
my
prayers
for
very
joy
both
children
said
their
prayers
and
each
thanked
god
in
her
own
way
for
the
blessing
he
had
bestowed
on
clara
who
had
for
so
long
lain
weak
and
ill
the
next
morning
the
grandfather
suggested
that
they
should
now
write
to
the
grandmamma
and
ask
her
if
she
would
not
come
and
pay
them
a
visit
as
they
had
something
new
to
show
her
but
the
children
had
another
plan
in
their
heads
for
they
wanted
to
prepare
a
great
surprise
for
grandmamma
clara
was
first
to
have
more
practice
in
walking
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
go
a
little
way
by
herself
above
all
things
grandmamma
was
not
to
have
a
hint
of
it
they
asked
the
grandfather
how
long
he
thought
this
would
take
and
when
he
told
them
about
a
week
or
less
they
immediately
sat
down
and
wrote
a
pressing
invitation
to
grandmamma
asking
her
to
come
soon
but
no
word
was
said
about
there
being
anything
new
to
see
the
following
days
were
some
of
the
most
joyous
that
clara
had
spent
on
the
mountain
she
awoke
each
morning
with
a
happy
voice
within
her
crying
i
am
well
now
i
am
well
now
i
sha
have
to
go
about
in
a
chair
i
can
walk
by
myself
like
other
people
then
came
the
walking
and
every
day
she
found
it
easier
and
was
able
to
go
a
longer
distance
the
movement
gave
her
such
an
appetite
that
the
grandfather
cut
his
bread
and
butter
a
little
thicker
each
day
and
was
well
pleased
to
see
it
disappear
he
brought
out
the
foaming
milk
in
a
larger
jug
so
he
could
fill
the
little
bowls
over
and
over
again
and
so
another
week
went
by
and
the
day
came
which
was
to
bring
grandmamma
up
the
mountain
for
her
second
visit
chapter
xxiii
to
the
beautiful
mountain
grandmamma
wrote
the
day
before
her
arrival
to
let
the
children
know
that
they
might
expect
her
without
fail
peter
brought
up
the
letter
early
the
following
morning
as
he
neared
the
group
his
steps
slackened
and
the
instant
he
had
handed
the
letter
to
uncle
he
turned
quickly
away
as
if
frightened
and
ran
off
up
the
mountain
grandfather
said
heidi
who
had
been
watching
him
with
astonished
eyes
why
does
peter
always
behave
now
like
the
great
turk
when
he
thinks
somebody
is
after
him
with
a
stick
he
turns
and
shakes
his
head
and
goes
off
with
a
bound
just
like
that
perhaps
peter
fancies
he
sees
the
stick
which
he
so
well
deserves
coming
after
him
answered
grandfather
heidi
set
about
tidying
the
hut
as
grandmamma
must
find
everything
clean
and
in
good
order
when
she
arrived
clara
looked
on
amused
and
interested
to
watch
the
busy
heidi
at
her
work
then
the
children
dressed
up
and
went
and
sat
together
outside
on
the
seat
ready
to
receive
her
at
last
they
saw
the
procession
winding
up
the
mountain
just
in
the
order
they
had
expected
first
there
was
the
guide
then
the
white
horse
with
grandmamma
mounted
upon
it
and
last
of
all
the
porter
with
a
heavy
bundle
on
his
back
for
grandmamma
would
not
think
of
going
up
the
mountain
without
a
full
supply
of
wraps
and
rugs
nearer
and
nearer
wound
the
procession
at
last
it
reached
the
top
and
grandmamma
was
there
looking
down
on
the
children
from
her
horse
she
no
sooner
saw
them
however
sitting
side
by
side
than
she
began
quickly
dismounting
as
she
cried
out
in
a
shocked
tone
of
voice
why
is
this
why
are
you
not
lying
in
your
chair
clara
what
are
you
all
thinking
about
but
even
before
she
had
got
close
to
them
she
threw
up
her
hands
in
astonishment
exclaiming
further
is
it
really
you
dear
child
why
your
cheeks
have
grown
quite
round
and
rosy
i
should
hardly
have
known
you
again
and
she
was
hastening
forward
to
embrace
her
when
heidi
slipped
down
from
the
seat
and
with
clara
leaning
on
her
shoulder
began
walking
along
quite
coolly
and
naturally
then
indeed
grandmamma
was
surprised
or
rather
alarmed
for
she
thought
at
first
that
it
must
be
some
proceeding
of
heidi
but
no
clara
was
actually
walking
steadily
and
uprightly
beside
heidi
laughing
and
crying
she
ran
to
them
and
embraced
first
clara
and
then
heidi
and
then
clara
again
unable
to
speak
for
joy
all
at
once
she
caught
sight
of
uncle
standing
by
the
seat
and
looking
on
smiling
at
the
meeting
she
went
up
to
the
old
man
and
seized
his
hands
my
dear
uncle
my
dear
uncle
how
much
we
have
to
thank
you
for
it
is
all
your
doing
it
is
your
care
and
nursing
and
god
good
sun
and
mountain
air
he
interrupted
her
smiling
yes
and
do
forget
the
beautiful
milk
i
have
put
in
clara
grandmamma
you
ca
think
what
a
quantity
of
goat
milk
i
drink
and
how
nice
it
is
i
can
see
that
by
your
cheeks
child
answered
grandmamma
i
really
should
not
have
known
you
you
have
grown
quite
strong
and
plump
and
taller
too
i
never
hoped
or
expected
to
see
you
look
like
that
i
can
not
take
my
eyes
off
you
for
i
can
hardly
yet
believe
it
but
now
i
must
telegraph
without
delay
to
my
son
in
paris
and
tell
him
he
must
come
here
at
once
i
shall
not
say
why
it
will
be
the
greatest
happiness
he
has
ever
known
my
dear
uncle
how
can
i
send
a
telegram
have
you
dismissed
the
men
yet
they
have
gone
he
answered
but
if
you
are
in
a
hurry
i
will
get
peter
and
he
can
take
it
for
you
grandmamma
thanked
him
for
she
was
anxious
that
the
good
news
should
not
be
kept
from
her
son
a
day
longer
than
was
possible
so
uncle
went
aside
a
little
way
and
blew
such
a
resounding
whistle
through
his
fingers
that
he
awoke
a
responsive
echo
among
the
rocks
far
overhead
he
did
not
have
to
wait
many
minutes
before
peter
came
running
down
in
answer
for
he
knew
the
sound
of
uncle
whistle
peter
looked
as
white
as
a
ghost
for
he
thought
uncle
was
sending
for
him
to
give
him
up
but
instead
he
only
gave
him
a
written
paper
with
instructions
to
take
it
down
at
once
to
the
at
doerfli
uncle
would
settle
for
the
payment
later
as
it
was
not
safe
to
give
peter
too
much
to
look
after
peter
went
off
with
the
paper
in
his
hand
feeling
some
relief
of
mind
for
the
present
for
as
uncle
had
not
whistled
for
him
in
order
to
give
him
up
it
was
evident
that
no
policeman
had
yet
arrived
so
now
they
all
sat
down
in
peace
to
their
dinner
round
the
table
in
front
of
the
hut
and
grandmamma
was
given
a
detailed
account
of
all
that
had
taken
place
how
grandfather
had
made
clara
try
first
to
stand
and
then
to
move
her
feet
a
little
every
day
and
how
they
had
settled
for
the
day
excursion
up
the
mountain
and
the
chair
had
been
blown
away
how
clara
desire
to
see
the
flowers
had
induced
her
to
take
the
first
walk
and
so
by
degrees
one
thing
had
led
to
another
the
recital
took
some
time
for
grandmamma
continually
interrupted
it
with
fresh
exclamations
of
surprise
and
thankfulness
it
hardly
seems
possible
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
is
not
all
a
dream
are
we
really
awake
and
are
we
all
sitting
here
by
the
mountain
hut
and
is
that
child
my
poor
little
white
sickly
clara
and
clara
and
heidi
could
not
get
over
their
delight
at
the
success
of
the
surprise
they
had
so
carefully
arranged
for
grandmamma
and
at
the
latter
continued
astonishment
meanwhile
sesemann
who
had
finished
his
business
in
paris
had
also
been
preparing
a
surprise
without
saying
a
word
to
his
mother
he
got
into
the
train
one
sunny
morning
and
travelled
that
day
to
basle
the
next
morning
he
continued
his
journey
for
a
great
longing
had
seized
him
to
see
his
little
daughter
from
whom
he
had
been
separated
the
whole
summer
he
arrived
at
ragatz
a
few
hours
after
his
mother
had
left
when
he
heard
that
she
had
that
very
day
started
for
the
mountain
he
immediately
hired
a
carriage
and
drove
as
far
as
doerfli
and
then
started
to
climb
the
mountain
he
went
on
and
on
but
still
no
hut
came
in
sight
and
yet
he
knew
there
was
one
where
peter
lived
half
way
up
for
the
path
had
been
described
to
him
over
and
over
again
he
began
to
wonder
if
he
was
on
the
right
path
and
whether
the
hut
lay
perhaps
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
he
looked
round
to
see
if
any
one
was
in
sight
of
whom
he
could
ask
the
way
but
far
and
wide
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
nor
a
sound
to
be
heard
only
at
moments
the
mountain
wind
whistled
through
the
air
and
the
insects
hummed
in
the
sunshine
or
a
happy
bird
sang
out
from
the
branches
of
a
solitary
larch
tree
sesemann
stood
still
for
a
while
to
let
the
cool
alpine
wind
blow
on
his
hot
face
but
now
some
one
came
running
down
the
mountainside
it
was
peter
with
the
telegram
in
his
hand
he
ran
straight
down
the
steep
slope
not
following
the
path
on
which
sesemann
was
standing
as
soon
as
the
latter
caught
sight
of
him
he
beckoned
to
him
to
come
peter
advanced
towards
him
slowly
and
timidly
with
a
sort
of
sidelong
movement
as
if
he
could
only
move
one
leg
properly
and
had
to
drag
the
other
after
him
hurry
up
lad
he
called
and
when
peter
was
near
enough
tell
me
he
said
is
this
the
way
to
the
hut
where
the
old
man
and
the
child
heidi
live
and
where
the
visitors
from
frankfurt
are
staying
a
low
sound
of
fear
was
the
only
answer
he
received
as
peter
turned
to
run
away
in
such
precipitous
haste
that
he
fell
head
over
heels
several
times
and
went
rolling
and
bumping
down
the
slope
in
involuntary
bounds
just
in
the
same
way
as
the
chair
only
that
peter
fortunately
did
not
fall
to
pieces
as
that
had
done
only
the
telegram
came
to
grief
and
that
was
torn
into
fragments
and
flew
away
how
extraordinarily
timid
these
mountain
dwellers
are
thought
sesemann
to
himself
for
he
quite
believed
that
it
was
the
sight
of
a
stranger
that
had
made
such
an
impression
on
this
unsophisticated
child
of
the
mountains
after
watching
peter
violent
descent
towards
the
valley
for
a
few
minutes
he
continued
his
journey
peter
meanwhile
with
all
his
efforts
could
not
stop
himself
but
went
rolling
on
and
still
tumbling
head
over
heels
at
intervals
in
a
most
remarkable
manner
illustration
peter
went
rolling
and
bumping
down
the
slope
but
this
was
not
the
most
terrible
part
of
his
sufferings
at
the
moment
for
far
worse
was
the
fear
and
horror
that
possessed
him
feeling
sure
as
he
did
now
that
the
policeman
had
really
come
over
for
him
from
frankfurt
he
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
the
stranger
who
had
asked
him
the
way
was
the
very
man
himself
just
as
he
had
rolled
to
the
edge
of
the
last
high
slope
above
doerfli
he
was
caught
in
a
bush
and
at
last
able
to
keep
himself
from
falling
any
farther
he
lay
still
for
a
second
or
two
to
recover
himself
and
to
think
over
matters
well
done
another
of
you
come
bumping
along
like
this
said
a
voice
close
to
peter
and
which
of
you
tomorrow
is
the
wind
going
to
send
rolling
down
like
a
sack
of
potatoes
it
was
the
baker
who
stood
there
laughing
he
had
been
strolling
out
to
refresh
himself
after
his
hot
day
work
and
had
watched
with
amusement
as
he
saw
peter
come
rolling
over
and
over
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
chair
peter
was
on
his
feet
in
a
moment
he
had
received
a
fresh
shock
without
once
looking
behind
him
he
began
hurrying
up
the
slope
again
he
would
have
liked
best
to
go
home
and
creep
into
bed
so
as
to
hide
himself
for
he
felt
safest
when
there
but
he
had
left
the
goats
up
above
and
uncle
had
given
him
strict
injunctions
to
make
haste
back
so
that
they
might
not
be
left
too
long
alone
and
he
stood
more
in
awe
of
uncle
than
any
one
and
would
not
have
dared
to
disobey
him
on
any
account
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
had
to
go
back
and
peter
went
on
groaning
and
limping
he
could
run
no
more
for
the
anguish
of
mind
he
had
been
through
and
the
bumping
and
shaking
he
had
received
were
beginning
to
tell
upon
him
and
so
with
lagging
steps
and
groans
he
slowly
made
his
way
up
the
mountain
shortly
after
meeting
peter
sesemann
passed
the
first
hut
and
so
was
satisfied
that
he
was
on
the
right
path
he
continued
his
climb
with
renewed
courage
and
at
last
after
a
long
and
exhausting
walk
he
came
in
sight
of
his
goal
there
only
a
little
distance
farther
up
stood
the
grandfather
home
with
the
dark
tops
of
the
fir
trees
waving
above
its
roof
sesemann
was
delighted
to
have
come
to
the
last
steep
bit
of
his
journey
in
another
minute
or
two
he
would
be
with
his
little
daughter
and
he
pleased
himself
with
the
thought
of
her
surprise
but
the
company
above
had
seen
his
approaching
figure
and
recognized
who
it
was
and
they
were
preparing
something
he
little
expected
as
a
surprise
on
their
part
as
he
stepped
on
to
the
space
in
front
of
the
hut
two
figures
came
towards
him
one
a
tall
girl
with
fair
hair
and
pink
cheeks
leaning
on
heidi
whose
dark
eyes
were
dancing
with
joy
sesemann
suddenly
stopped
staring
at
the
two
children
and
all
at
once
the
tears
started
to
his
eyes
what
memories
arose
in
his
heart
just
so
had
mother
looked
the
girl
with
the
delicate
complexion
he
did
not
know
if
he
was
awake
or
dreaming
do
you
know
me
papa
called
clara
to
him
her
face
beaming
with
happiness
am
i
so
altered
since
you
saw
me
then
the
father
ran
to
his
child
and
clasped
her
in
his
arms
yes
you
are
indeed
altered
how
is
it
possible
is
it
true
what
i
see
and
the
delighted
man
stepped
back
to
look
full
at
her
again
and
to
make
sure
that
the
picture
would
not
vanish
before
his
eyes
are
you
my
little
clara
really
my
little
clara
he
kept
on
saying
then
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
again
and
again
put
her
away
from
him
that
he
might
look
and
make
sure
it
was
she
who
stood
before
him
then
grandmamma
came
up
anxious
for
a
sight
of
her
son
happy
face
well
what
do
you
say
now
dear
son
she
exclaimed
you
have
given
us
a
pleasant
surprise
but
it
is
nothing
in
comparison
to
what
we
have
prepared
for
you
you
must
confess
and
she
gave
her
son
an
affectionate
kiss
as
she
spoke
but
now
she
went
on
you
must
come
and
pay
your
respects
to
uncle
who
is
our
chief
benefactor
yes
indeed
and
our
little
heidi
too
said
sesemann
shaking
heidi
by
the
hand
well
are
you
quite
well
and
happy
in
your
mountain
home
but
i
need
not
ask
no
alpine
rose
could
look
more
blooming
i
am
glad
child
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
see
you
so
and
heidi
looked
up
with
equal
pleasure
into
his
kind
face
how
good
he
had
always
been
to
her
and
that
he
should
find
such
happiness
awaiting
him
up
here
on
the
mountain
made
her
heart
beat
with
gladness
grandmamma
introduced
him
to
uncle
and
while
the
two
men
were
shaking
hands
and
sesemann
was
expressing
his
heartfelt
thanks
and
boundless
astonishment
to
the
old
man
grandmamma
wandered
round
to
the
back
to
see
the
old
fir
trees
again
here
another
unexpected
sight
met
her
gaze
for
there
under
the
trees
stood
a
great
bush
of
the
most
wonderful
dark
blue
gentians
as
fresh
and
shining
as
if
they
were
growing
on
the
spot
how
exquisite
what
a
lovely
sight
she
exclaimed
heidi
dearest
child
come
here
is
it
you
who
have
prepared
this
pleasure
for
me
it
is
perfectly
wonderful
the
children
ran
up
no
no
i
did
not
put
them
there
said
heidi
but
i
know
who
did
they
grow
just
like
that
on
the
mountain
grandmamma
only
if
anything
they
look
more
beautiful
still
clara
put
in
but
guess
who
brought
those
down
today
and
as
she
spoke
she
gave
such
a
pleased
smile
that
the
grandmother
thought
for
a
moment
the
child
herself
must
have
gathered
them
but
that
was
hardly
possible
at
this
moment
a
slight
rustling
was
heard
behind
the
fir
trees
it
was
peter
who
had
just
arrived
he
had
made
a
long
round
trying
to
slip
by
unobserved
but
grandmamma
had
seen
and
recognized
him
and
suddenly
the
thought
struck
her
that
it
might
be
peter
who
had
brought
the
flowers
and
that
he
was
now
trying
to
get
away
unseen
feeling
shy
about
it
but
she
could
not
let
him
go
off
like
that
he
must
have
some
little
reward
come
along
boy
come
here
do
not
be
afraid
she
called
to
him
peter
stood
still
petrified
with
fear
after
all
he
had
gone
through
that
day
he
felt
he
had
no
longer
any
power
of
resistance
left
all
he
could
think
was
it
all
up
with
me
now
every
hair
of
his
head
stood
on
end
and
he
stepped
forth
from
behind
the
fir
trees
his
face
pale
courage
boy
said
grandmamma
in
her
effort
to
dispel
his
shyness
tell
me
now
straight
out
without
hesitation
was
it
you
who
did
it
peter
did
not
lift
his
eyes
and
therefore
did
not
see
at
what
grandmamma
was
pointing
but
he
knew
that
uncle
was
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
hut
fixing
him
with
his
grey
eyes
while
beside
him
stood
the
most
terrible
person
that
peter
could
conceive
the
from
frankfurt
quaking
in
every
limb
and
with
trembling
lips
he
muttered
a
low
yes
well
and
what
is
there
dreadful
about
that
said
grandmamma
because
because
it
is
all
broken
to
pieces
and
no
one
can
put
it
together
again
peter
brought
out
his
words
with
difficulty
and
his
knees
knocked
together
so
that
he
could
hardly
stand
grandmamma
went
up
to
uncle
is
that
poor
boy
a
little
out
of
his
mind
she
asked
sympathizingly
not
in
the
least
uncle
assured
her
it
is
only
that
he
was
the
wind
that
sent
the
chair
rolling
down
the
slope
and
he
is
expecting
his
punishment
grandmamma
found
this
hard
to
believe
for
in
her
opinion
peter
did
not
look
an
entirely
bad
boy
nor
could
he
have
had
any
reason
for
destroying
such
a
necessary
thing
as
the
chair
but
uncle
had
only
given
expression
to
the
suspicion
that
he
had
had
from
the
moment
the
accident
happened
the
angry
looks
which
peter
had
from
the
beginning
cast
at
clara
and
the
other
signs
of
his
dislike
to
what
had
been
taking
place
on
the
mountain
had
not
escaped
uncle
eye
putting
two
and
two
together
he
had
come
to
the
right
conclusion
as
to
the
cause
of
the
disaster
and
he
therefore
spoke
without
hesitation
when
he
accused
peter
the
lady
broke
out
into
lively
expostulations
on
hearing
this
no
no
dear
uncle
we
will
not
punish
the
poor
boy
any
further
one
must
be
fair
to
him
here
are
all
these
strangers
from
frankfurt
who
come
and
carry
away
heidi
his
one
sole
possession
and
a
possession
well
worth
having
too
and
he
is
left
to
sit
alone
day
after
day
for
weeks
with
nothing
to
do
but
brood
over
his
wrongs
no
no
let
us
be
fair
to
him
his
anger
got
the
upper
hand
and
drove
him
to
an
act
of
revenge
a
foolish
one
i
own
but
then
we
all
behave
foolishly
when
we
are
angry
and
saying
this
she
went
back
to
peter
who
still
stood
frightened
and
trembling
she
sat
down
on
the
seat
under
the
fir
trees
and
called
him
to
her
kindly
come
here
boy
and
stand
in
front
of
me
for
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
leave
off
shaking
and
trembling
for
i
want
you
to
listen
to
me
you
sent
the
chair
rolling
down
the
mountain
so
that
it
was
broken
to
pieces
that
was
a
very
wrong
thing
to
do
as
you
yourself
knew
very
well
at
the
time
and
you
also
knew
that
you
deserved
to
be
punished
for
it
but
be
sure
of
this
peter
that
those
who
do
wrong
make
a
mistake
when
they
think
no
one
knows
anything
about
it
for
god
sees
and
hears
everything
and
when
the
wicked
doer
tries
to
hide
what
he
has
done
then
god
wakes
up
the
little
watchman
that
he
places
inside
us
all
when
we
are
born
and
who
sleeps
on
quietly
till
we
do
something
wrong
and
the
little
watchman
has
a
small
goad
in
his
hand
and
when
he
wakes
up
he
keeps
on
pricking
us
with
it
so
that
we
have
not
a
moment
peace
and
the
watchman
torments
us
still
further
for
he
keeps
on
calling
out
you
will
be
found
out
now
they
will
drag
you
off
to
punishment
and
so
we
pass
our
life
in
fear
and
trouble
and
never
know
a
moment
happiness
or
peace
have
you
not
felt
something
like
that
lately
peter
peter
gave
a
contrite
nod
of
the
head
as
one
who
knew
all
about
it
for
grandmamma
had
described
his
own
feelings
exactly
and
you
calculated
wrongly
also
in
another
way
continued
grandmamma
for
you
see
the
harm
you
intended
has
turned
out
for
the
best
for
those
you
wished
to
hurt
as
clara
had
no
chair
to
go
in
and
yet
wanted
so
much
to
see
the
flowers
she
made
the
effort
to
walk
and
every
day
since
she
has
been
walking
better
and
better
do
not
forget
my
words
and
whenever
you
feel
inclined
to
do
anything
wrong
think
of
the
little
watchman
inside
you
with
his
goad
and
his
disagreeable
voice
will
you
remember
all
this
yes
i
will
answered
peter
still
very
subdued
for
he
did
not
yet
know
how
the
matter
was
going
to
end
as
the
was
still
standing
with
the
uncle
that
right
and
now
the
thing
is
over
and
done
for
said
grandmamma
but
i
should
like
you
to
have
something
for
a
pleasant
reminder
of
the
visitors
from
frankfurt
can
you
tell
me
anything
that
you
have
wished
very
much
to
have
what
would
you
like
best
as
a
present
peter
lifted
his
head
at
this
and
stared
at
grandmamma
up
to
the
last
minute
he
had
been
expecting
something
dreadful
to
happen
and
now
he
might
have
anything
that
he
wanted
his
mind
seemed
all
of
a
whirl
i
mean
what
i
say
went
on
grandmamma
you
shall
choose
what
you
would
like
to
have
as
a
remembrance
from
the
frankfurt
visitors
and
as
a
token
that
they
will
not
think
any
more
of
the
wrong
thing
you
did
now
do
you
understand
me
boy
the
fact
began
at
last
to
dawn
upon
peter
mind
that
he
had
no
further
punishment
to
fear
and
that
the
kind
lady
sitting
in
front
of
him
had
delivered
him
from
the
he
suddenly
felt
as
if
the
weight
of
a
mountain
had
fallen
off
him
he
had
also
by
this
time
awakened
to
the
further
conviction
that
it
was
better
to
make
a
full
confession
at
once
of
anything
he
had
done
wrong
or
had
left
undone
and
so
he
said
and
i
lost
the
paper
too
grandmamma
had
to
consider
a
moment
what
he
meant
but
soon
recalled
his
connection
with
her
telegram
and
answered
kindly
you
are
a
good
boy
to
tell
me
never
conceal
anything
you
have
done
wrong
and
then
all
will
come
right
again
and
now
what
would
you
like
me
to
give
you
peter
grew
almost
giddy
with
the
thought
that
he
could
have
anything
in
the
world
that
he
wished
for
he
had
a
vision
of
the
yearly
fair
at
mayenfeld
with
the
glittering
booths
and
all
the
lovely
things
that
he
had
stood
gazing
at
for
hours
without
a
hope
of
ever
possessing
one
of
them
for
peter
purse
never
held
more
than
five
cents
and
all
these
fascinating
objects
cost
double
that
amount
there
were
the
pretty
little
red
whistles
that
he
could
use
to
call
his
goats
and
the
splendid
knives
with
rounded
handles
known
as
with
which
one
could
do
such
fine
whittling
peter
remained
pondering
he
was
trying
to
think
which
of
these
two
desirable
objects
he
should
best
like
to
have
and
he
found
it
difficult
to
decide
then
a
bright
thought
occurred
to
him
he
would
then
be
able
to
think
over
the
matter
between
now
and
next
year
fair
a
dime
answered
peter
who
was
no
longer
in
doubt
grandmamma
could
not
help
laughing
that
is
not
an
extravagant
request
come
here
then
and
she
pulled
out
her
purse
and
put
four
bright
silver
dollars
in
his
hand
and
then
laid
some
dimes
on
the
top
of
them
we
will
settle
our
accounts
at
once
she
continued
and
i
will
explain
them
to
you
i
have
given
you
as
many
dimes
as
there
are
weeks
in
the
year
and
so
every
sunday
throughout
the
year
you
can
take
out
a
dime
to
spend
as
long
as
i
live
said
peter
quite
innocently
grandmamma
laughed
more
still
at
this
and
the
men
hearing
her
paused
in
their
talk
to
listen
to
what
was
going
on
yes
boy
you
shall
have
it
all
your
life
i
will
put
it
down
in
my
will
do
you
hear
my
son
and
you
are
to
put
it
down
in
yours
as
well
a
dime
a
week
to
peter
as
long
as
he
lives
sesemann
nodded
his
assent
and
joined
in
the
laughter
peter
looked
again
at
the
present
in
his
hand
to
make
sure
he
was
not
dreaming
and
then
said
thank
god
and
he
went
off
running
and
leaping
with
more
even
than
his
usual
agility
and
this
time
managed
to
keep
his
feet
for
it
was
not
fear
but
joy
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
in
his
life
that
now
sent
him
flying
up
the
mountain
all
trouble
and
trembling
had
disappeared
and
he
was
to
have
a
dime
every
week
for
life
later
after
dinner
when
the
party
were
sitting
together
chatting
clara
drew
her
father
a
little
aside
and
said
with
an
eagerness
that
had
been
unknown
to
the
little
tired
invalid
o
papa
if
you
only
knew
all
that
grandfather
has
done
for
me
from
day
to
day
i
can
not
reckon
his
kindnesses
but
i
shall
never
forget
them
as
long
as
i
live
and
i
keep
on
thinking
what
i
could
do
for
him
or
what
present
i
could
make
him
that
would
give
him
half
as
much
pleasure
as
he
has
given
me
that
is
just
what
i
wish
most
myself
clara
replied
her
father
whose
face
grew
happier
each
time
he
looked
at
his
little
daughter
i
have
been
also
thinking
how
we
can
best
show
our
gratitude
to
our
good
benefactor
sesemann
went
over
to
uncle
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
said
dear
friend
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
have
known
no
real
happiness
for
years
past
what
good
were
money
and
property
to
me
when
they
were
unable
to
make
my
poor
child
well
and
happy
with
the
help
of
god
you
have
made
her
whole
and
strong
and
you
have
given
new
life
not
only
to
her
but
to
me
tell
me
now
in
what
way
can
i
show
my
gratitude
to
you
i
can
never
repay
all
you
have
done
but
whatever
is
in
my
power
to
do
is
at
your
service
speak
friend
and
tell
me
what
i
can
do
uncle
had
listened
to
him
quietly
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
on
his
face
as
he
looked
at
the
happy
father
sesemann
he
replied
in
his
dignified
way
i
too
have
my
share
in
the
joy
of
your
daughter
recovery
and
my
trouble
is
well
repaid
by
it
i
thank
you
heartily
for
all
you
have
said
but
i
have
need
of
nothing
i
have
enough
for
myself
and
the
child
as
long
as
i
live
of
course
i
am
growing
old
and
shall
not
be
here
much
longer
i
have
nothing
to
leave
the
child
when
i
die
if
you
could
promise
me
that
heidi
will
never
have
to
earn
her
living
among
strangers
then
you
would
richly
reward
me
for
all
i
have
done
for
your
child
there
could
never
be
any
question
of
such
a
thing
as
that
my
dear
friend
said
sesemann
quickly
i
look
upon
the
child
as
my
own
ask
my
mother
my
daughter
you
may
be
sure
that
they
will
never
allow
the
child
to
be
left
in
any
one
else
care
but
if
it
will
make
you
happier
i
give
you
here
my
hand
upon
it
i
promise
you
heidi
shall
never
have
to
go
and
earn
her
living
among
strangers
i
will
make
provision
against
this
both
during
my
life
and
after
but
now
i
have
something
else
to
say
independent
of
her
circumstances
the
child
is
totally
unfitted
to
live
a
life
away
from
home
we
found
that
out
when
she
was
with
us
but
she
has
made
friends
and
among
them
i
know
one
who
is
at
this
moment
in
frankfurt
he
is
winding
up
his
affairs
there
that
he
may
be
free
to
go
where
he
likes
and
take
his
rest
i
am
speaking
of
my
friend
the
doctor
who
came
over
here
in
the
autumn
and
who
having
well
considered
your
advice
intends
to
settle
in
this
neighborhood
for
he
has
never
felt
so
well
and
happy
anywhere
as
in
the
company
of
you
and
heidi
so
you
see
the
child
will
henceforth
have
two
protectors
near
her
and
may
they
both
live
long
to
share
the
task
illustration
are
you
really
my
little
clara
god
grant
indeed
it
may
be
so
added
grandmamma
shaking
uncle
hand
warmly
as
she
spoke
to
show
how
sincerely
she
echoed
her
son
wish
then
putting
her
arm
round
heidi
who
was
standing
near
she
drew
the
child
to
her
and
i
have
a
question
to
ask
you
too
dear
heidi
tell
me
if
there
is
anything
you
particularly
wish
for
yes
there
is
answered
heidi
promptly
looking
up
delightedly
at
grandmamma
then
tell
me
at
once
dear
what
it
is
i
want
to
have
the
bed
i
slept
in
at
frankfurt
with
the
high
pillows
and
thick
coverlid
and
then
grandmother
will
not
have
to
lie
with
her
head
down
hill
and
hardly
able
to
breathe
and
she
will
be
warm
enough
under
the
coverlid
not
to
have
to
wear
her
shawl
in
bed
to
prevent
her
freezing
to
death
in
her
eagerness
to
obtain
what
she
had
set
her
heart
upon
heidi
hardly
gave
herself
time
to
get
out
all
she
had
to
say
and
did
not
pause
for
breath
till
she
reached
the
end
of
her
sentence
dearest
child
answered
grandmamma
moved
by
heidi
speech
what
is
this
you
tell
me
of
grandmother
you
are
right
to
remind
me
in
the
midst
of
our
own
happiness
we
forget
too
often
that
which
we
ought
to
remember
before
all
things
when
god
has
shown
us
some
special
mercy
we
should
think
at
once
of
those
who
are
denied
so
many
things
i
will
telegraph
to
frankfurt
at
once
miss
rottermeyer
shall
pack
up
the
bed
this
very
day
and
it
will
be
here
in
two
days
time
god
willing
grandmother
shall
soon
be
sleeping
comfortably
upon
it
heidi
skipped
round
grandmamma
in
her
glee
and
then
stopping
all
of
a
sudden
said
quickly
i
must
make
haste
down
and
tell
her
no
no
heidi
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
said
her
grandfather
reprovingly
you
ca
be
running
backwards
and
forwards
like
that
when
you
have
visitors
but
grandmamma
interfered
on
heidi
behalf
the
child
is
not
so
far
wrong
uncle
she
said
and
poor
grandmother
has
too
long
been
deprived
of
heidi
for
our
sakes
let
us
all
go
down
to
her
together
i
believe
my
horse
is
waiting
for
me
and
i
can
ride
down
from
there
and
as
soon
as
i
get
to
doerfli
the
message
shall
be
sent
off
what
do
you
think
of
my
plan
son
sesemann
had
not
yet
had
time
to
speak
of
his
travelling
plans
so
he
begged
his
mother
to
wait
a
few
moments
that
he
might
tell
her
what
he
proposed
doing
sesemann
had
been
arranging
that
he
and
his
mother
should
make
a
little
tour
in
switzerland
first
ascertaining
if
clara
was
in
a
fit
state
to
go
some
part
of
the
way
with
them
but
now
he
would
have
the
full
enjoyment
of
his
daughter
company
and
that
being
so
he
did
not
want
to
miss
any
of
these
beautiful
days
of
later
summer
but
to
start
at
once
on
the
journey
that
he
now
looked
forward
to
with
such
additional
pleasure
and
so
he
proposed
that
they
should
spend
the
night
in
doerfli
and
that
next
day
he
should
come
and
get
clara
then
they
would
all
three
go
down
to
ragatz
and
make
that
their
starting
point
clara
was
rather
upset
at
first
at
the
thought
of
saying
like
this
to
the
mountain
she
could
not
help
being
pleased
however
at
the
prospect
of
another
journey
and
no
time
was
allowed
her
to
give
way
to
lamentation
grandmamma
had
already
taken
heidi
by
the
hand
preparatory
to
leading
the
way
when
she
suddenly
turned
but
what
is
to
become
of
clara
she
asked
remembering
all
at
once
that
the
child
could
not
yet
take
so
long
a
walk
she
gave
a
nod
of
satisfaction
as
she
saw
that
uncle
had
already
taken
clara
up
in
his
arms
and
was
following
her
with
sturdy
strides
sesemann
brought
up
the
rear
and
so
they
all
started
down
the
mountain
heidi
kept
jumping
for
joy
as
she
and
sesemann
walked
along
side
by
side
and
grandmamma
asked
all
about
peter
grandmother
how
she
lived
and
what
she
did
especially
in
the
winter
when
it
was
so
cold
and
heidi
gave
her
a
minute
account
of
everything
for
she
knew
all
that
went
on
at
grandmother
and
told
her
how
the
old
woman
sat
crouching
in
her
corner
and
trembling
with
cold
she
was
able
also
to
give
her
exact
particulars
of
what
grandmother
had
and
had
not
to
eat
grandmamma
listened
with
interest
and
sympathy
until
they
came
to
grandmother
brigitta
was
just
hanging
out
peter
second
shirt
in
the
sun
so
that
he
might
have
it
ready
to
put
on
when
he
had
worn
the
other
long
enough
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
company
approaching
she
rushed
indoors
the
whole
party
of
them
are
just
going
past
mother
evidently
all
returning
home
again
she
informed
the
old
woman
uncle
is
with
them
carrying
the
sick
child
alas
it
is
really
to
be
so
then
sighed
the
grandmother
and
you
saw
heidi
with
them
then
they
are
taking
her
away
if
only
she
could
come
and
put
her
hand
in
mine
again
if
i
could
but
hear
her
voice
once
more
at
this
moment
the
door
flew
open
and
heidi
sprang
across
to
the
corner
and
threw
her
arms
round
grandmother
grandmother
grandmother
my
bed
is
to
be
sent
from
frankfurt
with
all
the
three
pillows
and
the
thick
coverlid
grandmamma
says
it
will
be
here
in
two
days
heidi
could
not
get
out
her
words
quickly
enough
for
she
was
impatient
to
see
grandmother
great
joy
at
the
news
the
latter
smiled
but
said
a
little
sadly
she
must
indeed
be
a
good
kind
lady
and
i
ought
to
be
glad
to
think
she
is
taking
you
with
her
but
i
shall
not
outlive
it
long
what
is
this
i
hear
who
has
been
telling
my
good
grandmother
such
tales
exclaimed
a
kindly
voice
and
grandmother
felt
her
hand
taken
and
warmly
pressed
for
grandmamma
had
followed
heidi
in
and
heard
all
that
was
said
no
no
there
is
no
thought
of
such
a
thing
heidi
is
going
to
stay
with
you
and
make
you
happy
we
want
to
see
her
again
but
we
shall
come
to
her
we
hope
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
alm
every
year
for
we
have
good
cause
to
offer
up
especial
thanks
to
god
upon
this
spot
where
so
great
a
miracle
has
been
wrought
upon
our
child
then
grandmother
face
was
lighted
up
with
genuine
happiness
and
she
pressed
sesemann
hand
over
and
over
again
unable
to
speak
her
thanks
while
two
large
tears
of
joy
rolled
down
her
aged
cheeks
and
heidi
saw
the
glad
change
come
over
grandmother
face
and
she
too
now
was
entirely
happy
she
clung
to
the
old
woman
saying
has
it
all
come
about
grandmother
just
like
the
hymn
i
read
to
you
last
time
is
the
bed
from
frankfurt
sent
to
make
you
well
yes
heidi
and
many
many
other
good
things
too
which
god
has
sent
me
said
the
grandmother
deeply
moved
i
did
not
think
it
possible
that
there
were
so
many
kind
people
ready
to
trouble
themselves
about
a
poor
old
woman
and
to
do
so
much
for
her
nothing
strengthens
our
belief
in
a
kind
heavenly
father
who
never
forgets
even
the
least
of
his
creatures
so
much
as
to
know
that
there
are
such
people
full
of
goodness
and
pity
for
a
poor
useless
creature
such
as
i
am
my
good
grandmother
said
sesemann
interrupting
her
we
are
all
equally
poor
and
helpless
in
the
eyes
of
god
and
all
have
equal
need
that
he
should
not
forget
us
but
now
we
must
say
but
only
till
we
meet
again
for
when
we
pay
our
next
year
visit
to
the
alm
you
will
be
the
first
person
we
shall
come
and
see
meanwhile
we
shall
not
forget
you
and
sesemann
took
grandmother
hand
again
and
shook
it
in
farewell
but
grandmother
would
not
let
her
off
even
then
without
more
words
of
gratitude
and
without
calling
down
on
her
benefactress
and
all
belonging
to
her
every
blessing
that
god
had
to
bestow
at
last
sesemann
and
his
mother
were
able
to
continue
their
journey
downwards
while
uncle
carried
clara
back
home
with
heidi
beside
him
so
full
of
joy
of
what
was
coming
for
grandmother
that
every
step
was
a
jump
but
there
were
many
tears
shed
the
following
morning
by
the
departing
clara
who
wept
to
say
to
the
beautiful
mountain
home
where
she
had
been
happier
than
ever
before
in
her
life
heidi
did
her
best
to
comfort
her
summer
will
be
here
again
in
no
time
she
said
and
then
you
will
come
again
and
it
will
be
nicer
still
for
you
will
be
able
to
walk
about
from
the
beginning
we
can
then
go
out
every
day
with
the
goats
up
to
where
the
flowers
grow
and
enjoy
ourselves
from
the
moment
you
arrive
sesemann
had
come
as
arranged
to
take
his
little
daughter
away
and
was
just
now
standing
and
talking
with
uncle
for
they
had
much
to
say
to
one
another
clara
felt
somewhat
consoled
by
heidi
words
and
wiped
away
her
tears
be
sure
you
say
for
me
to
peter
and
the
goats
and
especially
to
little
swan
i
wish
i
could
give
little
swan
a
present
for
she
has
helped
so
much
to
make
me
strong
well
you
can
if
you
like
replied
heidi
send
her
a
little
salt
you
know
how
she
likes
to
lick
some
out
of
grandfather
hand
when
she
comes
home
at
night
clara
was
delighted
at
this
idea
oh
then
i
shall
send
a
hundred
pounds
of
salt
from
frankfurt
for
i
want
her
to
have
something
as
a
remembrance
of
me
sesemann
now
beckoned
to
the
children
as
it
was
time
to
be
off
grandmamma
white
horse
had
been
brought
up
for
clara
as
she
was
no
longer
obliged
to
be
carried
in
a
chair
heidi
ran
to
the
far
edge
of
the
slope
and
continued
to
wave
her
hand
to
clara
until
the
last
glimpse
of
horse
and
rider
had
disappeared
and
now
the
bed
has
arrived
and
grandmother
is
sleeping
so
soundly
all
night
that
she
is
sure
to
grow
stronger
grandmamma
sesemann
moreover
has
not
forgotten
how
cold
the
winter
is
on
the
mountain
she
has
sent
a
large
parcel
of
warm
clothing
of
every
description
so
that
the
blind
grandmother
can
wrap
herself
round
and
round
and
will
certainly
not
tremble
with
cold
now
as
she
sits
in
her
corner
there
is
a
great
deal
of
building
going
on
at
doerfli
the
doctor
has
arrived
and
for
the
present
is
occupying
his
old
quarters
his
friends
have
advised
him
to
buy
the
old
house
that
uncle
and
heidi
live
in
during
the
winter
the
doctor
is
having
this
part
of
the
old
house
rebuilt
for
himself
the
other
part
being
repaired
for
uncle
and
heidi
for
the
doctor
is
aware
that
uncle
is
a
man
of
independent
spirit
who
likes
to
have
a
house
to
himself
quite
at
the
back
a
warm
and
stall
is
being
put
up
for
the
two
goats
and
there
they
will
pass
their
winter
in
comfort
the
two
men
are
becoming
better
friends
every
day
and
as
they
walk
about
the
new
buildings
to
see
how
they
are
getting
on
their
thoughts
continually
turn
to
heidi
for
the
chief
pleasure
to
each
in
connection
with
the
house
is
that
they
will
have
the
little
child
with
them
there
dear
friend
said
the
doctor
on
one
of
these
occasions
as
they
were
standing
together
you
will
see
this
matter
in
the
same
light
as
i
do
i
am
sure
i
share
your
happiness
in
the
child
as
if
next
to
you
i
was
the
one
to
whom
she
most
closely
belonged
but
i
wish
also
to
share
all
responsibilities
concerning
her
and
to
do
my
best
for
the
child
i
shall
then
feel
i
have
my
rights
in
her
and
shall
look
forward
to
her
being
with
me
and
caring
for
me
in
my
old
age
which
is
the
one
great
wish
of
my
heart
she
will
have
the
same
claims
upon
me
as
if
she
were
my
own
child
and
i
shall
provide
for
her
as
such
and
so
we
shall
be
able
to
leave
her
without
anxiety
when
the
day
comes
that
you
and
i
must
go
uncle
did
not
speak
but
he
clasped
the
doctor
hand
in
his
and
his
good
friend
could
read
in
the
old
man
eyes
how
greatly
moved
he
was
and
how
glad
and
grateful
he
felt
heidi
and
peter
were
at
this
moment
sitting
with
grandmother
and
the
one
had
so
much
to
relate
and
the
others
to
listen
to
that
they
all
three
got
closer
and
closer
to
one
another
hardly
able
to
breathe
in
their
eagerness
not
to
miss
a
word
and
how
much
there
was
to
tell
of
all
the
events
that
had
taken
place
that
last
summer
for
they
had
not
had
many
opportunities
of
meeting
since
then
and
it
was
difficult
to
say
which
of
the
three
looked
the
happiest
at
being
together
again
and
at
the
recollection
of
all
the
wonderful
things
that
had
happened
mother
brigitta
face
was
perhaps
the
happiest
of
all
as
now
with
the
help
of
heidi
explanation
she
was
able
to
understand
for
the
first
time
the
history
of
peter
weekly
dime
for
life
then
at
last
the
grandmother
spoke
heidi
read
me
one
of
the
hymns
i
feel
i
can
do
nothing
for
the
remainder
of
my
life
but
thank
the
father
in
heaven
for
all
the
mercies
he
has
shown
us
