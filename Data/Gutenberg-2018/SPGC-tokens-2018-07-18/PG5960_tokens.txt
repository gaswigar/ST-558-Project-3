outstretched

old
people

san
was
called
before
her
father
with
paint
and
brush
she
fell
to
work
at
the
slightest
sound
she
listened
not
willing
to
be
surpassed
in
salutation
my
heart
bleed
for
lonely
she
busied
herself
with
serving

tea
very
helpless
and
lonesome
to
make
good

promise

the
gods
chapter
i
a
quaint
old
japanese
garden
lay
smiling
under
the
sunshine
of
a
morning
in
early
spring
the
sun
having
flooded
the
outside
world
with
dazzling
light
seemed
to
sink
to
a
tender
radiance
as
it
wooed
leaf
and
bud
into
new
life
and
loveliness
it
loosened
the
tiny
rivulet
from
the
icy
fingers
of
winter
and
sped
it
merrily
on
its
way
to
a
miniature
lake
where
shining
goldfish
darted
here
and
there
in
an
ecstasy
of
motion
it
stole
into
the
shadows
of
a
great
and
touched
the
white
wings
of
the
pigeons
as
they
cooed
the
song
of
it
gleamed
on
the
sandy
path
that
led
to
the
old
stone
lantern
played
into
the
eyes
of
kwannon
the
goddess
of
mercy
and
finally
lost
itself
in
the
trees
beyond
under
a
gnarled
that
for
uncounted
years
had
braved
the
snow
and
answered
joyously
the
first
call
of
spring
a
little
maiden
stood
and
held
out
eager
hands
to
catch
the
falling
blossoms
the
was
nearly
done
and
the
child
stood
watching
the
petals
twirl
quickly
down
filling
the
hollows
and
fashioning
curious
designs
on
the
mossy
grass
the
softest
of
breezes
coming
across
the
river
over
the
thick
hedge
saucily
blew
a
stray
petal
straight
into
the
child
face
to
yuki
chan
it
was
a
challenge
and
with
outstretched
hands
and
flying
feet
she
gave
chase
to
the
whirling
blossoms
round
and
round
the
old
tree
into
the
hedge
and
up
the
sandy
path
she
raced
her
long
sleeves
spreading
like
tiny
sails
her
cheeks
flushed
to
the
same
crimson
as
her
flowery
playmates
a
sudden
stillness
in
the
air
ended
the
romp
yuki
chan
returned
to
her
playground
beneath
the
tree
and
taking
her
captured
petals
from
the
folds
of
her
kimono
began
to
count
her
trophies
ichi
ni
san
ichi
ni
san
she
rhythmically
droned
three
being
the
magical
number
that
would
bring
good
luck
if
the
petals
were
properly
arranged
and
the
number
repeated
often
enough
but
the
monotony
of
repetition
brought
rest
and
soon
yuki
chan
forgetting
to
count
made
a
bed
of
the
fallen
petals
and
turned
her
face
toward
the
little
house
from
which
noises
of
busy
preparation
came
it
was
a
birthday
not
yuki
chan
for
that
came
with
the
this
was
the
third
day
of
the
third
month
which
in
the
long
ago
was
set
apart
as
the
big
birthday
of
all
little
girls
born
in
the
lovely
island
and
was
celebrated
by
the
festival
of
dolls
yuki
chan
lay
with
her
slim
body
stretched
in
the
warmth
of
the
sun
in
every
graceful
line
was
the
imprint
of
high
breeding
her
white
face
so
unusual
with
her
race
was
stamped
with
the
romance
and
tragedy
of
centuries
while
her
eyes
limpid
and
luminous
looked
out
at
the
world
with
eager
questioning
interest
through
the
of
the
house
she
caught
glimpses
of
her
father
and
mother
hurrying
and
holding
consultations
she
marked
frequent
visits
to
the
old
warehouse
that
held
the
household
treasures
and
the
bringing
out
of
bundles
wrapped
in
yellow
cloth
the
air
brought
her
whiffs
of
cooking
food
and
the
and
deposited
a
fair
part
of
their
stock
on
the
porch
but
yuki
chan
was
banished
from
these
joys
of
preparation
because
of
naughtiness
and
as
she
lay
in
the
warm
sunshine
she
thought
of
her
recent
wickedness
she
smiled
as
she
remembered
how
she
had
hid
her
pipe
that
he
might
work
the
faster
and
broken
the
straps
of
her
mother
wooden
shoes
so
that
she
could
not
go
outdoors
she
laughed
softly
when
she
thought
of
the
stray
cat
which
she
had
brought
into
the
house
and
coaxed
to
drink
milk
while
she
with
skilful
fingers
and
a
pair
of
scissors
transformed
her
smooth
fur
into
a
wonderful
landscape
garden
short
work
had
made
kitty
head
slick
and
shiny
like
a
lake
with
a
stray
bristle
or
two
which
stood
for
trees
in
the
middle
of
her
back
stood
fuji
the
great
mountain
with
numberless
little
fujis
to
keep
company
many
winding
paths
ran
down
kitty
legs
to
queer
shapeless
shrines
and
it
was
only
when
yuki
chan
had
insisted
on
making
a
curious
old
with
twisted
limbs
of
kitty
short
and
stubby
tail
that
trouble
ensued
and
she
had
been
requested
by
her
mother
to
take
her
honorable
little
body
to
the
garden
yuki
chan
remembered
her
mother
beautiful
smile
of
love
as
she
gently
chided
her
and
recalled
the
note
of
trouble
in
the
kind
voice
was
the
mother
sorry
because
she
had
stuck
out
a
very
pink
tongue
at
a
old
image
that
sat
on
the
floor
on
the
very
spot
that
she
wanted
to
step
upon
or
was
it
and
yuki
chan
grew
grave
that
the
last
had
been
spent
for
the
new
dress
she
was
to
wear
that
day
all
her
short
life
yuki
chan
had
lived
in
a
house
of
love
but
no
veil
of
affection
no
sacrifice
could
shield
her
from
the
knowledge
of
poverty
she
had
never
seen
her
mother
wear
but
one
festival
dress
yet
her
own
little
kimono
was
ever
bright
and
dainty
and
even
the
new
brocade
of
the
dolls
dresses
stood
alone
with
the
weave
of
gold
and
tinsel
a
solemn
thought
like
a
pebble
dropped
into
water
caused
circle
after
circle
to
trouble
her
childish
mind
she
did
not
quite
understand
but
she
knew
there
was
something
she
must
learn
she
had
been
naughty
and
weighed
her
mother
spirits
she
had
caused
a
grave
look
in
her
father
kind
eyes
and
had
sent
the
household
pets
scattering
with
her
mischief
now
she
must
be
good
very
good
else
the
fox
spirit
would
come
upon
her
and
she
would
go
through
life
an
unhappy
soul
she
would
give
more
obedience
to
the
honorable
mother
whose
every
word
had
been
a
caress
it
was
as
if
for
the
first
time
the
great
book
of
life
opened
before
her
and
though
unconscious
of
its
meaning
the
first
word
she
saw
spelled
duty
the
noises
from
the
house
grew
fainter
the
child
with
blinking
eyes
lay
gazing
straight
above
her
overhead
the
branches
overflowed
into
a
canopy
of
crimson
which
shut
out
the
great
real
world
and
opened
into
a
fairy
world
wherein
only
the
untried
feet
of
youth
may
tread
and
the
fragile
flowers
of
bloom
the
gates
thereto
are
slight
but
strong
and
only
knowledge
erects
an
impassable
barrier
the
wind
sang
its
lullaby
through
the
blossoms
of
the
tree
and
sleep
would
soon
have
overtaken
yuki
chan
had
not
a
peculiar
sound
aroused
her
and
caused
her
eyes
to
fly
wide
open
once
before
she
had
heard
it
and
it
had
meant
death
to
the
big
robin
who
lived
in
the
branches
above
the
cry
came
from
the
mother
bird
this
time
and
brought
yuki
chan
to
her
feet
through
the
shower
of
blossoms
brought
down
by
the
mad
fluttering
of
wings
she
saw
a
tiny
thing
struggling
in
the
sharp
claws
of
her
lately
acquired
pet
with
certainty
of
success
the
cat
let
its
victim
weakly
flutter
an
inch
or
two
away
then
reaching
out
a
cruel
paw
drew
it
back
twice
repeated
the
green
eyes
narrowed
to
slits
and
yuki
chan
horrified
saw
big
red
drops
slowly
dripping
from
either
side
of
the
whiskered
mouth
terror
held
her
for
a
moment
as
she
heard
the
crunching
of
small
bones
then
white
passion
enveloped
her
as
she
stole
noiselessly
from
behind
and
closed
her
two
small
hands
around
the
furry
throat
baka
she
cried
from
between
her
clenched
teeth
to
eat
the
baby
birds
this
day
will
i
ask
oni
to
make
you
into
a
stone
which
every
foot
will
kick
and
hurt
and
you
can
neither
move
nor
cry
you
cruel
cruel
beast
in
vain
the
cat
struggled
yuki
chan
held
it
firmly
at
while
she
decided
what
was
to
be
its
fate
looking
sternly
at
the
offender
her
lips
rounded
into
a
the
light
of
anticipated
revenge
danced
in
her
eyes
at
last
she
knew
what
to
do
o
most
honorable
but
very
ugly
cat
she
would
throw
her
into
the
ditch
where
great
crawling
frogs
with
popping
eyes
would
stick
out
long
tongues
where
flying
things
would
sting
and
creeping
things
would
bite
where
the
great
tide
would
come
later
and
take
her
out
to
the
big
big
ocean
where
there
was
neither
milk
to
drink
nor
birds
to
eat
at
the
thought
of
her
furry
playmate
floating
alone
and
hungry
in
the
vast
place
which
to
yuki
chan
had
neither
beginning
nor
end
something
of
pity
touched
her
heart
and
she
slightly
loosened
her
grasp
the
cat
gained
a
good
breath
and
used
it
in
the
fight
for
freedom
a
sharp
claw
was
drawn
down
the
child
arm
leaving
a
line
of
red
in
its
course
compassion
took
flight
and
yuki
chan
clutching
anew
went
swiftly
down
the
path
that
led
to
the
street
with
a
watchful
eye
on
the
lodge
of
the
keeper
of
the
gate
the
keeper
was
very
old
and
very
cross
and
lately
had
acquired
a
curious
idea
that
little
girls
must
ask
his
honorable
permission
to
go
in
and
out
the
gate
one
day
he
actually
threatened
punishment
and
yuki
chan
in
her
scorn
invited
him
to
cut
off
his
head
with
a
sword
that
he
might
save
his
face
now
the
way
was
clear
she
turned
her
head
and
bumped
her
small
body
against
the
weight
of
the
heavy
gates
until
they
swung
slightly
apart
and
permitted
her
to
slip
through
so
intent
was
her
purpose
to
reach
the
ditch
across
the
street
that
she
did
not
see
an
approaching
jinrikisha
and
before
she
knew
it
she
had
been
tumbled
over
and
sent
rolling
to
the
side
of
the
road
still
clutching
the
kitten
she
sat
up
and
rubbed
the
dust
from
her
eyes
standing
over
her
was
the
jinrikisha
man
and
beside
him
was
his
passenger
a
young
american
boy
whose
light
hair
and
blue
eyes
held
her
he
was
brushing
the
dust
from
her
kimono
and
his
foreign
tongue
made
strange
sounds
say
kid
the
boy
was
saying
as
he
transferred
the
dust
from
his
hands
to
his
handkerchief
glad
you
not
hurt
or
got
any
bones
cracked
where
your
mama
or
your
papa
or
your
nurse
to
give
you
a
spanking
and
keep
you
off
the
street
as
he
talked
yuki
chan
grew
fascinated
watching
his
mouth
and
forgot
for
a
moment
her
direful
intention
the
cat
again
taking
advantage
of
her
relaxed
hold
began
to
tug
for
freedom
and
a
lively
struggle
ensued
the
boy
looking
on
began
to
laugh
a
laugh
that
began
in
his
eyes
ran
over
his
face
and
down
into
his
throat
whence
it
came
again
in
a
shout
of
boyish
merriment
yuki
chan
looking
from
him
to
the
smiling
jinrikisha
man
grew
crimson
with
anger
with
a
swift
movement
she
ran
toward
the
ditch
divining
her
purpose
by
the
look
in
her
eyes
dick
merrit
went
gallantly
to
the
rescue
of
the
kitten
he
was
tall
for
his
sixteen
years
and
his
long
strides
more
than
matched
the
pattering
steps
of
the
slip
of
a
girl
who
raced
before
him
no
you
do
kiddie
he
cried
your
manicured
cat
is
not
going
into
the
ditch
if
we
have
to
scrap
for
it
merrit
caught
yuki
chan
in
one
arm
and
again
and
again
loosened
her
fingers
from
the
struggling
kitten
iya
iya
the
child
screamed
but
merrit
as
determined
as
she
held
her
firmly
and
ended
by
lightly
slapping
first
one
little
hand
and
then
the
other
the
child
thus
coming
into
contact
for
the
first
time
with
physical
force
relaxed
her
grasp
and
gazed
in
amazement
at
the
determined
face
i
guess
your
means
no
little
lady
and
i
say
too
said
merrit
taking
the
cat
into
his
arms
and
smoothing
its
uneven
back
you
are
not
going
to
put
it
into
the
ditch
why
do
you
give
it
to
me
i
am
getting
up
a
collection
of
cats
and
things
at
the
school
and
i
like
to
take
this
queer
specimen
along
ask
her
if
i
can
have
it
the
jinrikisha
man
who
stood
a
smiling
spectator
saw
dick
hand
move
toward
his
pocket
and
was
instantly
alert
and
eager
to
settle
the
matter
him
bad
girl
he
said
him
make
dead
for
catty
you
give
me
ten
sen
i
take
girl
homely
you
have
much
of
catty
but
dick
declined
all
interference
and
putting
the
cat
inside
his
coat
he
stooped
down
and
took
one
of
yuki
chan
unresisting
hands
her
sleeve
fell
back
and
he
saw
the
long
red
scratch
hello
the
cat
had
an
inning
too
did
she
i
like
to
chuck
her
for
hurting
you
but
i
ca
let
you
give
her
a
bath
in
that
dirty
hole
never
mind
i
take
her
home
and
some
day
i
bring
you
something
i
bet
you
do
understand
a
word
i
saying
but
i
be
hanged
if
i
know
how
to
make
you
feeling
rather
helpless
dick
talked
on
patting
first
yuki
chan
and
then
the
cat
the
child
stood
speechless
and
looked
deep
into
his
eyes
not
having
entirely
recovered
from
the
shock
of
the
first
blow
she
had
ever
received
you
be
good
wo
you
he
went
on
coaxingly
not
drown
any
more
cats
and
things
yuki
chan
with
the
intuition
that
only
a
child
can
have
suddenly
bridged
the
gulf
of
strange
language
and
understood
with
the
quick
movement
of
a
nestling
bird
she
bent
forward
and
laid
her
cheek
against
the
boy
shoulder
it
was
not
only
complete
surrender
but
allegiance
to
the
conqueror
dick
rose
red
and
confused
then
he
climbed
into
the
jinrikisha
trying
to
ignore
the
smiles
of
the
man
yuki
chan
with
her
hands
joined
just
below
her
sash
bent
her
body
like
a
arigato
arigato
she
said
politely
as
she
bowed
again
and
again
him
say
you
interpreted
the
jinrikisha
man
called
dick
do
forget
be
good
yuki
chan
watched
the
back
of
the
jinrikisha
and
the
swinging
brown
legs
of
the
jinrikisha
man
that
showed
beneath
she
had
forgotten
the
cat
but
she
still
remembered
the
kind
look
in
the
blue
eyes
of
the
boy
yuki
yuki
came
the
voice
of
the
mother
in
her
native
tongue
come
the
feast
is
prepared
and
the
sandals
are
worn
from
my
feet
running
to
seek
you
hurry
before
the
red
beans
grow
cold
the
child
sent
a
hei
in
answer
to
her
mother
then
to
herself
she
said
over
and
over
be
goodu
be
goodu
she
had
heard
the
words
a
few
times
before
but
they
were
associated
with
her
visits
to
the
and
a
certain
oblong
box
out
of
which
came
sticks
of
red
and
white
with
a
very
sweet
taste
now
as
she
said
them
a
new
meaning
seemed
to
play
about
them
she
slipped
through
the
gate
and
walked
with
unhurried
feet
toward
the
small
house
so
gay
in
its
festal
plumage
as
she
passed
the
old
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
mother
bird
cuddling
her
babies
beneath
her
breast
some
tender
thought
lighted
the
child
face
into
a
strange
beauty
as
a
stray
sunbeam
finds
a
hidden
flower
and
glorifies
it
turning
her
face
upward
to
the
nest
she
patted
her
own
cheek
and
said
be
goodu

in
the
springtime
a
japanese
house
is
a
thing
with
only
top
and
bottom
of
straw
and
a
few
upholding
posts
to
give
it
a
look
of
substance
yuki
chan
house
was
typical
the
paper
screens
were
carefully
put
away
during
the
day
that
the
breezes
might
play
unobstructed
through
the
house
at
night
the
heavy
wooden
doors
were
fitted
into
grooves
and
served
not
only
to
keep
out
the
night
air
but
also
the
evil
spirits
that
come
abroad
when
the
great
sun
ceases
watching
binding
the
whole
was
a
narrow
porch
showing
a
floor
polished
like
a
mirror
from
the
slipping
and
sliding
of
generations
of
feet
yuki
chan
first
learned
to
know
her
face
in
its
reflections
and
alas
by
the
same
method
had
learned
the
saucy
fascination
of
sticking
out
her
small
pink
tongue
on
the
side
of
the
porch
toward
the
the
child
found
her
father
and
mother
waiting
the
two
old
people
sat
on
gay
cushions
with
hands
folded
and
feet
crossed
their
festal
attire
bore
the
marks
of
a
once
careless
luxury
but
now
shabbiness
tried
to
hide
itself
under
the
bravery
of
tinsel
where
once
had
been
pure
gold
each
year
the
struggle
of
obsolete
methods
of
business
and
the
intricacies
of
progress
plowed
the
furrows
a
little
deeper
in
the
man
face
and
when
his
eyes
that
in
youth
had
blazed
with
ambition
grew
wistful
and
troubled
he
dropped
them
that
his
wife
might
not
see
but
what
silence
could
hide
from
this
frail
woman
any
mood
of
the
man
she
had
served
with
mind
and
body
and
soul
these
many
years
when
she
came
to
him
as
a
shy
bride
on
trial
she
knew
no
such
word
as
love
duty
was
her
entire
vocabulary
and
she
asked
nothing
and
gave
all
many
little
souls
had
come
to
her
with
hands
all
crimped
and
pink
like
only
to
close
their
eyes
and
pass
out
to
the
good
god
jizo
who
is
always
waiting
to
help
little
children
across
the
river
of
death
in
years
gone
by
night
after
night
sleep
had
flown
before
the
terror
that
another
woman
would
be
brought
into
the
house
that
the
family
name
might
not
die
out
silently
she
would
slip
out
to
the
little
shrine
and
pour
out
passionate
words
of
prayer
that
just
one
little
soul
might
be
permitted
to
live
no
matter
how
long
the
night
nor
how
bitter
the
struggle
morning
always
found
her
bright
and
cheerful
bending
every
effort
to
invent
new
diversions
for
her
husband
she
labored
to
anticipate
every
wish
and
even
though
she
did
without
she
provided
him
the
best
of
comfort
working
far
into
the
night
secretly
disposing
of
her
small
personal
treasures
acquiescing
in
his
most
trivial
statements
she
planned
that
no
slightest
gap
in
the
domestic
arrangement
should
suggest
itself
to
him
the
woman
worked
and
prayed
and
waited
then
she
triumphed
in
the
wake
of
a
great
came
the
child
and
they
called
her
yuki
after
the
snow
that
had
brought
them
their
wish
hand
in
hand
with
yuki
chan
came
love
and
bound
the
hearts
of
the
man
and
woman
with
ties
of
a
desire
fulfilled
from
that
time
to
this
love
had
prevailed
and
as
yuki
chan
climbed
on
the
porch
besmirching
its
shining
surface
with
her
muddy
little
feet
that
had
been
guiltless
of
sandals
all
day
the
faces
of
the
two
old
people
lighted
up
with
sudden
joy
yuki
chan
looked
ruefully
at
the
muddy
prints
she
had
made
and
realized
that
she
had
been
a
most
impolite
little
girl
remembering
her
recent
resolve
she
sought
the
eyes
in
which
she
had
never
seen
any
light
for
her
save
that
of
love
she
drew
close
and
reaching
down
took
her
mother
hand
hard
and
cracked
by
labor
and
laying
her
cheek
against
it
said
with
a
voice
sure
of
forgiveness
and
sweet
desire
for
atonement
go
men
nasai
the
mother
with
a
courtly
but
playful
air
granted
her
pardon
with
a
low
salutation
then
with
a
rush
of
affection
that
no
convention
could
stem
she
folded
the
child
to
her
heart
and
lived
another
moment
of
supreme
joy
the
father
sat
by
making
no
comment
his
eyes
bright
and
twinkling
then
he
suggested
that
their
majesties
the
dolls
had
been
waiting
long
on
the
shelf
was
it
not
time
they
were
receiving
a
visit
the
years
of
toil
were
telling
on
both
father
and
mother
but
they
daily
refreshed
themselves
at
the
overbrimming
fountain
of
yuki
youth
and
now
as
they
each
took
one
of
her
hands
to
go
in
to
see
the
dolls
they
were
so
gay
that
the
child
suggested
that
instead
of
walking
they
should
do
the
new
she
had
learned
at
the
kindergarten
it
was
conduct
but
it
was
for
yuki
chan
and
father
and
mother
stumped
along
cheered
on
by
the
small
girl
who
was
trying
to
keep
time
but
was
breathless
through
sheer
excess
of
happiness
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
to
impede
their
progress
no
chairs
with
treacherous
legs
to
trip
over
no
beds
nor
tables
with
sharp
corners
nothing
whatever
but
the
matting
soft
and
thick
where
yuki
chan
had
practised
all
the
gymnastics
of
childhood
unbruised
and
unharmed
half
skipping
half
hopping
and
wholly
undone
with
laughter
and
exertion
the
three
at
last
reached
the
place
where
for
six
years
offerings
had
been
made
for
the
gift
of
the
child
who
stood
to
these
two
for
love
arranged
in
the
best
room
in
the
house
on
five
long
shelves
were
dolls
big
dolls
and
little
dolls
thin
ones
and
fat
ones
each
one
to
represent
some
royal
man
or
woman
of
the
long
ago
and
dressed
in
a
fashion
of
a
time
almost
forgotten
there
was
jimmu
tenno
the
first
real
emperor
his
hair
was
done
in
a
curious
fashion
and
his
dress
was
of
a
wonderful
brocade
while
his
hands
clasped
two
swords
there
was
jingo
too
who
had
won
fame
and
lasting
honor
by
her
wonderful
fighting
and
was
so
great
she
had
to
sit
by
the
emperors
and
look
down
on
the
other
empresses
such
a
lot
of
them
some
worthy
to
be
remembered
every
day
in
the
year
others
the
more
quickly
forgotten
the
better
yuki
chan
knew
them
all
by
heart
and
she
lingered
before
those
she
liked
and
quickly
passed
those
she
did
not
care
for
she
could
not
be
rude
to
an
emperor
even
though
he
had
been
dead
hundreds
of
years
she
was
really
not
very
afraid
of
the
greatness
of
the
old
doll
men
and
women
who
sat
on
the
shelf
still
it
was
well
to
be
careful
about
handling
them
she
might
be
turned
into
a
lizard
or
a
snake
just
as
the
old
had
said
but
her
delight
was
in
the
miniature
toilet
articles
of
solid
silver
costly
gold
lacquer
and
porcelain
so
tiny
so
beautifully
carved
they
must
have
meant
the
eyesight
of
some
workman
only
too
glad
to
shut
out
the
sunlight
forever
if
he
might
produce
just
one
perfect
thing
the
things
however
that
made
yuki
chan
clap
her
hands
and
the
nesting
birds
perk
up
their
heads
at
the
sound
of
her
clear
sweet
laugh
were
the
funny
little
lacquer
carts
in
which
the
royalty
was
supposed
to
ride
drawn
by
impossible
fat
bullocks
so
that
their
curves
formed
a
big
round
yuki
chan
made
her
red
lips
into
the
same
shape
and
called
her
mother
to
look
she
pretended
to
feed
the
dolls
with
real
food
and
wine
and
actually
played
with
the
five
court
musicians
because
they
were
partly
servants
and
it
did
not
matter
her
tongue
ran
in
ceaseless
chatter
her
father
and
mother
hovered
around
her
repeating
the
history
of
all
those
wonderful
people
yuki
chan
listened
very
little
so
concerned
was
she
with
her
own
comments
until
she
happened
to
see
an
anxious
look
creep
into
her
eyes
it
was
something
every
little
girl
must
know
and
if
yuki
honorable
ears
refused
to
open
how
would
she
learn
then
yuki
chan
nestled
close
and
gave
little
pats
of
love
and
tried
to
listen
the
shadows
of
the
bamboo
grew
long
and
slim
as
the
sun
kissed
them
good
night
the
sails
skimmed
homeward
on
a
silver
sea
as
the
west
covered
its
rosy
pink
in
a
veil
of
deepest
blue
the
young
birds
in
the
old
did
not
stir
at
the
loving
touch
of
the
mother
who
with
a
soft
bill
searched
and
sought
for
the
lost
one
the
lingered
yet
for
a
night
as
the
air
had
grown
chill
within
the
house
yuki
chan
still
dressed
lay
on
the
floor
weary
with
the
wonders
of
the
day
her
mother
took
from
a
small
inclosure
beneath
a
shelf
many
soft
comforts
with
which
she
arranged
the
bed
yuki
chan
talking
all
the
time
in
a
low
monotone
tried
to
unravel
a
tangle
in
her
mind
of
birds
and
cats
and
dolls
it
was
all
getting
unmanageable
and
very
hazy
when
her
mother
gathered
her
into
her
arms
and
quickly
casting
aside
her
two
garments
laid
her
gently
in
a
bath
of
caressing
warmth
a
moment
more
and
the
little
maiden
lay
like
a
in
her
bed
the
made
shadowy
ghosts
of
all
it
touched
and
one
gleam
of
light
escaping
the
paper
shade
hung
like
an
aureole
above
the
head
of
yuki
chan
mother
as
she
knelt
with
clasped
hands
before
the
buddha
on
the
shelf
her
moving
lips
had
only
one
refrain
the
child
the
child
the
child
yuki
chan
watched
the
play
of
the
light
in
the
room
what
funny
things
those
shadows
made
and
strangely
enough
one
more
wonderful
than
all
the
rest
grew
into
the
shape
of
the
boy
and
his
lips
were
saying
be
good
then
yuki
chan
lost
herself
in
a
mist
of
drowsiness
and
her
mother
sat
by
and
kept
time
with
her
hand
as
she
chanted
rather
than
sang
sleep
little
one
sleep
the
sparrows
are
nodding
beneath
the
deep
the
is
burning
thy
mother
is
watching
sleep
little
one
sleep

footnote
the
honorific
used
only
in
childhood
is
changed
to
in
later
years
had
passed
from
childhood
into
girlhood
and
had
already
touched
the
border
of
that
grave
land
of
where
all
the
worries
lie
for
though
she
was
apparently
only
a
larger
edition
of
the
spoiled
impulsive
happy
child
of
old
yet
often
her
eyes
were
shadowed
with
the
struggle
of
shielding
her
aging
father
and
mother
from
the
poverty
that
was
coming
closer
day
by
day
during
the
three
years
she
had
been
gaining
her
education
at
the
english
they
had
toiled
unceasingly
that
she
might
have
the
best
the
country
could
afford
but
now
that
she
had
returned
after
her
long
struggle
with
a
strange
language
and
a
strange
people
it
was
but
fitting
that
she
should
take
up
her
duties
as
the
daughter
of
an
impoverished
family
of
high
rank
the
father
grown
old
and
feeble
gave
up
the
battle
for
existence
and
being
a
devout
buddhist
turned
his
thoughts
upon
nirvana
which
he
strove
diligently
to
enter
by
perpetual
meditation
and
prayer
the
mother
used
to
guidance
and
unable
to
think
or
plan
for
herself
turned
helplessly
to
yuki
san
the
duties
were
heavy
for
girlish
shoulders
and
often
as
the
dawn
crept
over
the
mountains
it
found
the
girl
and
still
trying
to
solve
the
problem
of
modest
demand
and
meager
supply
she
had
learned
many
things
at
the
she
could
read
and
write
english
imperfectly
she
could
recite
the
multiplication
table
faster
than
any
one
else
she
could
perform
the
most
intricate
figures
in
physical
culture
and
if
she
had
infinite
time
she
could
play
three
hymns
on
the
organ
these
varied
accomplishments
however
seemed
of
little
assistance
in
showing
her
how
to
stretch
her
father
small
pension
beyond
the
barest
necessities
of
the
household
tales
had
been
told
her
of
a
great
land
far
beyond
her
home
where
women
of
the
highest
birth
went
out
to
work
in
the
busy
world
how
she
had
marveled
at
their
boldness
and
wondered
at
the
customs
that
would
permit
it
now
she
half
envied
them
their
freedom
and
sighed
over
the
etiquette
that
forbade
a
departure
from
her
father
roof
save
for
the
inevitable
end
of
all
japanese
women
a
prearranged
marriage
it
was
for
this
she
had
been
so
carefully
trained
in
all
phases
of
housekeeping
and
in
all
the
intricacies
of
social
life
her
education
from
birth
had
been
with
a
view
of
making
smooth
the
path
of
her
future
husband
that
his
home
might
be
peaceful
and
he
untroubled
each
day
as
the
burden
grew
heavier
she
fought
her
battle
with
the
bravery
and
courage
of
youth
with
jests
and
chatter
she
served
her
parents
simple
meals
constantly
urging
them
to
further
indulgence
of
what
she
pretended
was
a
great
feast
but
which
in
reality
she
had
secretly
sacrificed
some
household
treasure
to
obtain
she
deftly
turned
the
as
she
served
that
they
might
not
see
the
scant
supply
with
great
ceremony
she
poured
the
hot
water
into
the
bowls
insisting
that
no
other
was
made
such
as
this
her
determination
to
keep
them
happy
and
ignorant
of
the
true
conditions
taxed
her
every
resource
but
it
was
her
duty
and
duty
to
yuki
san
was
the
only
religion
of
which
she
was
sure
but
one
day
a
great
event
happened
in
the
little
home
yuki
san
was
called
before
her
father
and
told
in
ceremonious
language
that
a
marriage
had
been
arranged
for
her
with
saito
san
a
wealthy
officer
in
the
emperor
household
she
laid
her
head
upon
the
mats
and
gave
thanks
to
the
gods
now
her
father
and
mother
would
live
in
luxury
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
saito
san
was
to
her
only
a
shadowy
being
whom
she
was
to
obey
for
the
rest
of
her
life
and
whose
house
she
was
to
keep
in
order
he
was
a
means
to
an
end
and
entered
into
her
thoughts
merely
as
one
to
whom
she
was
deeply
grateful
youth
and
all
its
joys
were
strong
within
her
and
the
pressure
of
poverty
gone
her
whole
nature
rebounded
with
delight
many
times
had
marriage
been
proposed
for
her
for
the
story
of
her
beauty
and
obedience
had
spread
but
her
father
guarded
his
treasure
zealously
and
it
was
not
until
an
offer
came
suiting
his
former
rank
and
condition
that
he
gave
his
consent
now
when
he
saw
the
happy
light
in
the
eyes
of
his
child
and
saw
the
color
come
into
her
cheeks
he
laid
his
hands
upon
her
head
and
blessed
her
when
yuki
san
was
by
herself
she
clapped
her
hands
joyfully
i
make
happy
like
she
whispered
hooray
hooray
now
my
troublesome
make
absence
and
she
hurried
away
to
put
a
before
the
household
god
having
arranged
all
preliminaries
and
instructed
the
mother
to
sell
every
household
treasure
that
his
child
clothes
might
do
honor
to
the
rich
man
house
the
father
went
back
once
more
to
his
pipe
and
his
dreams
yuki
san
and
her
mother
were
up
with
the
sun
sewing
and
embroidering
and
going
about
their
daily
task
with
zest
and
song
the
past
trials
were
forgotten
and
the
future
not
considered
one
morning
not
many
weeks
after
the
marriage
had
been
arranged
yuki
san
heard
the
call
of
the
san
and
running
out
to
meet
him
received
a
letter
the
envelope
was
white
and
square
and
straight
across
the
middle
in
very
plain
english
was
her
name
and
address
puzzled
she
turned
it
over
and
over
then
broke
the
seal
the
picture
of
the
big
hotel
at
the
top
of
the
sheet
was
so
distracting
that
for
a
time
she
could
get
no
further
but
a
word
here
and
there
and
the
signature
at
the
end
finally
made
her
cry
out
with
delight
and
surprise
oh
it
from
that
funny
lil
boy
what
gave
spank
to
my
hands
long
time
ago
he
want
to
come
to
my
house
for
stay
listen
there
was
no
one
to
listen
but
her
own
happy
self
and
lying
flat
upon
the
floor
she
propped
her
glowing
face
between
her
palms
while
she
read
aloud
from
the
letter
spread
before
her
yokohama
miss
yuki
inouye
miss
i
wonder
if
you
remember
an
american
boy
with
whom
you
had
an
encounter
in
your
very
early
days
because
he
dared
to
thwart
your
plans
concerning
a
cat
i
remember
it
very
well
and
the
jolly
picnics
and
excursions
that
you
and
my
mother
and
i
took
together
afterward
i
hope
you
have
not
forgotten
me
for
i
am
going
to
claim
the
privilege
of
the
conqueror
in
that
old
battle
and
ask
a
favor
of
you
my
government
has
sent
me
out
to
your
country
on
some
important
business
and
finding
there
was
no
hotel
close
to
my
work
i
wrote
to
the
school
where
my
mother
and
i
visited
twelve
years
ago
and
asked
them
to
recommend
a
family
that
would
be
good
enough
to
take
me
in
for
two
months
strangely
enough
your
father
name
was
suggested
and
when
i
read
that
the
only
daughter
both
spoke
and
wrote
english
and
that
her
name
was
yuki
san
my
mind
flew
back
to
my
little
sister
snow
of
the
days
gone
by
could
your
father
manage
to
accommodate
me
for
a
couple
of
months
if
i
promise
to
be
very
good
and
take
up
as
little
room
as
possible
if
you
think
he
can
please
wire
me
here
at
yokohama
and
i
come
straight
down
hoping
to
see
you
very
soon
i
am
your
old
friend
richard
melton
merrit
yuki
san
turned
the
letter
this
way
and
that
and
vainly
tried
to
decipher
the
strange
words
it
was
undoubtedly
english
but
not
the
english
she
was
used
to
she
ran
for
her
small
dictionary
and
diligently
searched
out
the
meaning
of
each
phrase
yes
she
remembered
the
boy
he
had
light
hair
and
blue
eyes
that
laughed
and
he
was
a
big
big
boy
and
carried
her
on
his
shoulder
she
sat
with
the
folded
letter
clasped
carefully
in
her
hands
and
gave
herself
up
to
joyous
anticipation
a
foreign
guest
was
coming
to
stay
two
whole
months
in
her
house
after
that
she
was
to
be
married
and
wear
her
beautiful
kimono
and
give
rich
gifts
to
her
father
and
mother
surely
buddha
was
caring
for
her
there
had
been
grave
moments
of
doubt
about
it
since
she
left
the
for
he
had
never
seemed
to
listen
though
she
prayed
him
night
and
day
but
he
had
been
only
waiting
to
send
all
her
happiness
at
once
he
was
a
good
god
kind
and
thoughtful
before
the
sun
touched
the
big
on
the
she
would
go
to
the
temple
and
tell
him
so
yuki
san
plans
found
favor
with
her
parents
chiefly
because
of
their
great
desire
to
give
her
pleasure
and
incidentally
because
the
board
of
the
foreigner
would
swell
the
fund
that
was
needed
for
her
marriage
the
plighted
maid
to
them
was
already
the
wife
and
the
danger
of
a
youthful
heart
defying
tradition
and
clearing
the
bars
of
conventionality
to
reach
its
own
desire
was
something
unknown
to
these
simple
people
the
child
wished
the
foreigner
to
come
they
could
give
her
few
pleasures
she
should
have
her
desire
the
sending
of
the
telegram
was
the
first
exciting
thing
to
be
attended
to
five
times
yuki
san
rewrote
the
short
message
finding
her
fingers
less
deft
than
her
tongue
in
framing
an
english
sentence
gravely
and
with
effort
she
wrote
i
give
you
all
my
house
your
lovely
friend
yuki
but
she
shook
her
head
over
this
and
tried
again
you
have
the
welcome
of
my
heart
yuki
this
too
fell
short
of
her
ideal
so
she
decided
to
send
simply
two
words
of
which
she
was
quite
sure
please
come
the
days
that
followed
were
crowded
with
busy
preparation
the
difficulty
of
providing
the
ease
and
comfort
that
the
presence
of
so
honorable
a
guest
demanded
taxed
to
the
utmost
yuki
san
resourceful
nature
gaily
she
set
her
wits
and
fingers
to
work
placing
a
heavy
brass
over
a
black
scorch
in
the
matting
fitting
new
into
the
small
wooden
squares
of
the
and
hanging
over
the
ugly
holes
made
by
the
missing
plaster
in
the
wall
from
one
part
of
the
house
to
another
she
flitted
laughing
and
working
while
the
old
garden
echoed
her
happiness
and
overflowed
with
blossom
and
song
on
the
day
of
merrit
expected
arrival
when
the
last
flower
had
been
put
in
the
vases
and
the
last
speck
of
dust
flecked
from
the
matting
yuki
san
keen
eyes
detected
a
torn
place
in
the
paper
door
which
separated
the
from
the
narrow
hall
a
puzzled
little
frown
drew
her
black
brows
together
but
it
soon
fled
before
her
smile
ah
she
cried
idea
come
quickly
i
write
picture
of
bamboo
on
teared
place
with
paint
and
brush
she
fell
to
work
and
beneath
her
skilful
fingers
the
ugly
tear
disappeared
in
a
forest
of
slender
which
stretched
away
to
the
foot
of
a
mountain
with
a
last
touch
she
sank
back
on
her
heels
and
viewed
her
work
with
deep
satisfaction
all
finished
she
said
opening
wide
her
arms
no
more
to
do
now
but
wait
for
that
time
sensei
call
jollyful
a
laugh
behind
her
made
her
turn
her
head
quickly
and
there
in
the
doorway
stood
a
tall
foreigner
with
outstretched
hand
of
welcome
was
an
unknown
art
with
yuki
san
so
after
one
startled
upward
glance
she
touched
her
head
to
the
floor
in
gracious
courtesy
all
her
gay
spirits
and
freedom
of
speech
vanished
and
she
was
instantly
enveloped
in
a
mist
of
shyness
and
reserve
that
direct
look
did
not
serve
to
lessen
with
lowered
eyes
she
ushered
him
into
the
larger
and
bade
him
be
seated
and
accept
all
the
hospitality
her
father
poor
house
could
give
after
a
long
and
tiresome
journey
merrit
found
something
inexpressibly
charming
in
the
quiet
picturesque
place
and
in
the
silent
young
girl
who
sat
so
demurely
in
the
shadow
he
tactfully
ignored
her
timidity
by
talking
cheerful
nonsense
about
impersonal
things
treating
her
as
a
bashful
child
who
wanted
to
be
friends
but
hardly
dared
as
he
talked
yuki
san
gained
courage
and
ventured
many
curious
glances
at
the
young
fellow
whose
figure
seemed
completely
to
fill
the
room
at
first
she
saw
only
a
strange
foreigner
but
gradually
as
she
watched
his
face
and
listened
to
his
unfamiliar
speech
she
discovered
a
playmate
through
all
the
years
that
she
had
struggled
for
an
education
at
the
english
had
been
invariably
associated
with
a
tall
awkward
foreign
boy
whose
mouth
made
funny
curves
and
whose
eyes
laughed
when
he
made
strange
sounds
how
big
and
splendid
and
handsome
he
had
grown
how
different
his
clothes
from
any
she
had
ever
seen
before
how
white
his
long
hands
whose
strong
firm
touch
she
remembered
so
well
she
looked
and
looked
again
drinking
in
the
tones
of
his
deep
voice
till
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
sent
a
flood
of
crimson
to
her
cheeks
but
gradually
her
shyness
wore
away
and
when
merrit
asked
her
how
in
the
world
he
was
to
conduct
his
business
with
so
few
japanese
words
at
his
command
she
ventured
to
answer
i
know
i
give
you
the
teach
of
nippon
you
give
me
the
wise
of
dat
funny
tongue
that
a
go
said
dick
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
close
the
bargain
but
the
girl
drew
back
troubled
no
no
you
no
you
stay
i
give
you
all
my
intellect
of
nippon
speech
please
and
she
looked
up
pleadingly
merrit
laughed
outright
that
all
right
yuki
san
i
am
going
to
stay
and
we
will
begin
school
in
the
morning
by
this
time
the
mother
and
father
had
learned
of
the
guest
arrival
and
hurried
in
to
bid
him
welcome
the
unpacking
of
his
and
the
disposal
of
his
possessions
in
his
small
apartment
was
a
matter
of
interest
to
the
whole
family
each
article
was
politely
examined
and
exclaimed
over
and
when
merrit
drew
out
a
package
of
photographs
and
showed
them
his
home
and
family
and
friends
the
excitement
became
intense
that
night
yuki
san
lay
once
more
on
her
soft
and
watched
the
shadow
of
the
play
upon
the
screens
nothing
was
changed
in
the
homely
room
since
she
had
lain
there
in
her
babyhood
the
same
little
lamp
the
same
little
buddha
on
the
shelf
looking
at
her
with
inscrutable
eyes
yuki
san
stirred
restlessly
dat
most
nice
girl
in
picture
she
said
to
herself
him
make
marry
with
dat
girl
he
say
then
she
added
inconsequently
with
a
sigh
i
much
hope
saito
san
go
to
war
for
long
long
time
chapter
iv
for
two
halcyon
months
yuki
san
lived
in
a
dream
the
ample
compensation
merrit
insisted
upon
making
for
the
hospitality
extended
to
him
more
than
met
the
modest
needs
of
the
little
household
and
once
again
as
in
the
earlier
days
they
went
on
jolly
excursions
visited
ancient
temples
and
picnicked
under
the
shadow
of
the
the
father
and
mother
always
trotted
close
behind
and
yuki
san
vastly
pleased
with
her
ability
gaily
translated
the
speeches
from
one
to
another
she
talked
incessantly
laughing
over
her
own
mistakes
and
growing
prettier
and
more
winsome
every
day
merrit
was
glad
to
fill
his
leisure
time
in
such
pleasant
companionship
yuki
san
was
the
same
little
bundle
of
charm
he
remembered
of
old
with
her
innocence
untouched
and
a
heart
whose
depths
had
never
yet
been
stirred
he
teased
her
and
taught
her
and
played
with
her
as
he
would
have
played
with
a
merry
child
naturally
gentle
and
affectionate
he
unconsciously
swept
yuki
san
to
the
borderland
of
that
golden
world
where
to
awaken
alone
is
agony
one
morning
when
the
heavy
mists
of
the
valley
lay
in
masses
of
pink
against
the
deeper
purple
of
the
mountain
and
his
highness
the
sun
his
face
flushed
from
his
long
climb
was
sending
his
first
glances
over
the
sunny
peaks
of
yuki
san
arose
after
a
sleepless
night
and
faced
the
morning
with
sorrowful
eyes
you
lazy
mister
sun
this
morning
she
said
shaking
a
finger
at
him
in
reproof
where
you
the
have
been
why
you
not
come
the
more
early
and
make
light
for
my
busy
she
tied
the
long
sleeves
of
her
bright
kimono
out
of
her
way
and
twisting
a
bit
of
cloth
about
her
head
fell
to
dusting
the
and
setting
the
small
room
in
order
i
must
the
hurry
she
said
as
she
kept
up
her
brisk
dusting
i
make
the
food
so
quick
as
that
robin
san
steal
berry
for
his
babies
him
one
big
big
day
but
him
no
glad
day
merrit
san
go
away
she
paused
in
her
work
and
a
look
of
pain
darkened
her
eyes
but
she
shook
her
head
reproachfully
ah
yuki
san
you
make
sorry
voice
and
your
heart
is
thinking
tears
you
naughty
girl
quick
you
make
the
fire
to
rise
in
and
give
that
merrit
san
his
same
thing
what
that
funny
call
breakfast
after
the
steam
had
begun
to
rise
from
the
vessels
on
several
yuki
san
flushed
by
her
exertions
rested
upon
her
heels
before
the
door
that
led
into
the
garden
as
she
fanned
her
flushed
face
with
her
sleeve
she
glanced
again
and
again
toward
the
narrow
stairway
that
led
to
the
chamber
above
and
at
the
slightest
sound
she
listened
in
smiling
expectancy
from
outside
the
wall
came
the
gentle
of
the
water
against
the
and
the
cheerful
banter
of
the
owners
as
they
made
ready
for
the
work
of
the
day
circling
the
garden
the
maples
made
a
note
of
vivid
crimson
amid
the
feathery
green
of
the
bamboo
every
feature
of
the
place
was
closely
associated
with
her
short
happy
life
she
had
learned
to
walk
on
the
soft
sandy
paths
she
had
spelled
out
her
first
characters
on
the
old
she
had
whispered
her
secrets
to
the
image
of
kwannon
who
sat
in
the
shadow
of
the
pines
and
there
under
the
she
had
caught
the
naughty
kitten
that
first
brought
her
and
merrit
san
together
as
she
sat
with
folded
hands
and
watched
the
sunshine
on
the
dewy
leaves
and
flowers
her
intense
restless
vivacious
body
relaxed
in
sudden
languor
and
her
soft
mouth
drooped
in
wistfulness
a
splash
in
the
pool
below
attracted
her
and
looking
down
she
saw
the
gleaming
bodies
of
the
goldfish
as
they
leaped
into
the
air
instantly
she
was
all
life
and
volubility
yuki
san
one
big
bad
girl
she
no
remember
fish
they
always
like
hungry
baby
san
in
early
morning
i
make
fast
to
fill
big
hole
inside
outside
slipping
her
feet
out
of
her
straw
she
stepped
into
her
wooden
and
passing
a
shelf
filled
her
hands
with
round
the
edge
of
the
water
turned
to
gold
as
the
fish
crowded
close
yuki
san
scattered
the
crumbs
and
stood
watching
the
wriggling
mass
for
a
moment
then
said
you
greedy
fish
i
never
no
can
fill
your
bodies
now
i
get
flower
for
merrit
san
breakfast
she
made
her
way
over
the
flat
mossy
stones
passed
the
miniature
fuji
where
dwelt
the
spirit
of
the
wondrous
lady
who
made
the
flowers
to
bloom
she
paused
before
the
gorgeous
chrysanthemums
and
looked
long
at
the
with
their
tender
tints
of
dawn
but
at
last
she
spied
on
a
set
apart
from
the
rest
a
single
white
rose
with
a
heart
of
red
with
a
little
cry
of
satisfaction
she
thrust
her
hands
among
the
thorns
to
pluck
it
the
rebound
of
the
bush
sent
fluttering
to
her
feet
a
brilliant
purple
butterfly
tender
to
all
living
things
yuki
san
dropped
quickly
to
her
knees
and
folded
the
creature
between
the
palms
of
her
warm
hands
ah
cho
cho

she
said
the
day
of
yesterday

and

the
weakness
of

that
jack

him
naughty
boy
she
put
her
moist
red
lips
to
her
folded
palms
and
the
warmth
of
her
breath
stirred
to
action
the
gauzy
creature
she
held
captive
you
no
must
kick

cho
san

the
patience
i
make
you
warm
i
give
you
one
more
day
of
happy
yuki
san
wooden
shoes
sent
a
sharp
click
into
the
quiet
morning
air
as
she
quickly
crossed
the
arched
bridge
and
followed
the
path
to
the
stone
image
beyond
the
pool
with
a
touch
as
soft
as
the
wings
she
held
the
girl
lightly
balanced
the
now
thoroughly
warmed
butterfly
on
the
broad
forehead
of
the
goddess
of
mercy
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
spirit
of
the
scene
came
the
clear
rollicking
strains
of
an
american
air
whistled
by
some
one
coming
down
the
steps
for
a
moment
yuki
san
stood
motionless
pressing
her
lips
softly
to
the
rose
she
held
then
with
a
swift
she
ran
back
to
the
house
the
top
of
the
morning
to
the
honorable
miss

said
merrit
who
quite
filled
the
doorway
not
willing
to
be
surpassed
in
salutation
yuki
san
laid
a
hand
on
each
knee
and
bending
her
back
at
right
angles
replied
with
mock
gravity
ohayo
wa
yoi
o

merrit
knew
she
had
him
at
a
disadvantage
in
her
own
language
but
always
delighted
to
see
the
play
of
her
dimples
and
the
soft
pink
creep
into
her
cheeks
when
he
teased
he
stood
by
her
now

and

and
growling

above
her
head
she
bent
till
the
tips
of
her
fingers
touched
the
floor
still
bent
she
twisted
her
head
till
her
eyes
bright
with
laughter
looked
straight
into
merrit
he
lifted
his
eyebrows
quizzically
see
here
yuki
san
you
are
fast
developing
the
symptoms
of
a
coquette
she
quickly
straightened
her
back
and
with
a
smile
of
bewilderment
exclaimed
me
croquette
no
no
croquette
him
what
you
eat
i
no
can
be
eat
merrit
shouted
with
delight
then
grew
grave
no
yuki
san
you
do
ever
want
to
be
a
coquette
you
want
to
be
your
sweet
little
self
and
make
a
good
wife
to
that
handsome
soldier
saito
with
all
his
gold
braid
and
but
what
about
breakfast
you
see
my
train
leaves
in
an
hour
if
you
do
give
me
something
to
fill
my
honorable
insides
i
have
to
eat
you
sure
enough
in
mock
fear
she
quickly
brought
a
low
table
from
an
inner
room
and
with
deft
hands
placed
the
steaming
soup
and
broiled
fish
before
him
the
knife
and
fork
were
a
concession
to
merrit
inability
to
wield
the
chopsticks
and
sitting
on
his
heels
was
merrit
concession
to
the
inability
of
the
house
to
provide
a
chair
hello
he
said
picking
up
a
rose
where
did
you
find
this
beauty
i
guessed
her
with
my
nose
the
girl
answered
you
know
what
make
her
heart
so
red
long
time
ago
most
beautiful
princess
love
with
wrong
man
make
buddha
angly
and
he
turn
her
body
into
white
rose
but
her
heart
just
stay
all
time
red
of
beautiful
love
that
was
there
my
he
a
fierce
old
customer
that
buddha
of
yours
said
merrit
yuki
san
paused
in
the
filling
of
the
and
looked
at
him
gravely
merrit
san
do
you
know
god
do
i
know
god
he
repeated
with
a
laugh
yes
christians
god
what
you
must
love
and
love
but
no
never
can
see
till
come
you
know
merrit
san
then
lowering
her
voice
in
earnest
inquiry
she
went
on
you
believe
that
god
more
better
for
japanese
girl
than
buddha
for
a
moment
merrit
felt
the
hot
blood
of
confusion
rise
to
his
temples
the
role
of
spiritual
adviser
was
a
new
and
somewhat
embarrassing
one
struggling
for
expression
he
floundered
hopelessly
i
i
i
guess
i
do
know
very
much
about
it
but
there
one
sure
tip
yuki
san
the
christians
god
is
all
right
you
ca
lose
out
if
you
pin
to
him
he
stammered
like
a
foolish
schoolboy
but
struggled
bravely
on
when
things
get
pretty
thick
and
you
struck
bottom
that
the
time
you
find
out
i
know
i
been
there
more
the
pity
i
do
remember
it
oftener
and
you
think
him
more
better
for
me
asked
yuki
san
still
perplexed
you
bet
i
do
said
merrit
with
conviction
take
my
word
for
it
and
do
forget
i
no
forget
she
said
a
sliding
of
the
screen
and
a
call
from
the
announced
the
arrival
of
the
jinrikisha
men
who
had
come
for
the
baggage
merrit
thrust
back
his
breakfast
by
jove
i
most
forgotten
this
is
my
last
meal
with
you
just
to
think
all
that
tiresome
old
government
contract
is
finished
and
soon
be
on
my
way
to
the
other
side
you
want
to
see
other
side
she
asked
mama
san
not
there
no
more
then
seeing
his
face
darken
she
laid
a
quick
hand
of
sympathy
on
his
i
have
the
sorrowful
for
you
she
said
earnestly
then
went
on
hastily
that
other
side
yes
i
know
that
most
beautiful
most
big
ship
in
the
world
come
rolling
into
hatoba
merrit
san
so
long
and
big
stand
way
out
front
and
see
over
much
people
then
he
cry
out
herro
with
glad
and
much
joyful
he
see
that
lovely
girl
like
picture
waiting
there
without
pausing
for
a
reply
she
pushed
open
a
door
and
called
in
japanese
to
her
father
and
mother
who
never
made
their
appearance
till
merrit
breakfast
was
finished
come
make
ready
to
give
our
guest
an
honorable
departure
she
said
in
the
small
courtyard
facing
the
street
the
girl
found
the
men
with
their
jinrikishas
and
waiting
to
convey
merrit
to
the
station
she
carefully
directed
the
tying
on
of
the
various
trunks
and
bags
and
placed
the
family
just
where
they
should
stand
that
the
greatest
honor
might
be
done
the
departing
guest
as
merrit
came
out
of
the
little
house
and
reached
for
his
shoes
which
stood
waiting
at
the
side
yuki
san
started
toward
him
eager
to
serve
him
to
the
last
merrit
motioned
her
back
do
come
too
near
yuki
san
if
you
happened
to
fall
into
one
of
those
shoes
you
be
lost
for
ever
and
ever
and
that
big
saito
would
be
inviting
me
to
cut
off
my
head
yuki
san
laughed
and
smoothed
the
cushions
in
the
jinrikisha
while
she
gave
minute
directions
to
the
jinrikisha
men
merrit
made
his
adieu
with
high
good
humor
and
so
many
big
words
that
yuki
san
was
hard
pressed
to
interpret
he
invited
the
family
and
all
their
relatives
to
come
to
see
him
in
america
when
he
reached
yuki
san
he
held
out
his
hand
made
shy
by
the
unusual
ceremony
she
timidly
laid
a
cold
and
unresponsive
little
palm
in
his
he
looked
down
from
his
height
with
tender
memories
of
all
her
gentle
courtesies
little
he
said
i
never
forget
japan
nor
you
she
withdrew
her
hand
and
looked
inquiringly
up
at
him
some
long
time
you
come
back
merrit
climbed
into
the
jinrikisha
no
yuki
san
you
know
i
soon
have
a
little
home
of
my
own
to
work
and
care
for
i
be
a
busy
man
for
the
next
few
years
so
i
guess
i
not
come
back
as
in
a
dream
yuki
san
saw
the
men
adjust
their
hats
and
tighten
their
sashes
as
they
took
their
places
in
front
of
the
small
vehicle
mechanically
she
bowed
her
farewell
with
the
rest
of
the
family
but
she
did
not
join
their
sayonara
she
watched
the
swift
moving
of
the
jinrikisha
wheels
then
she
saw
merrit
turn
at
the
gate
and
wave
his
hat
as
he
joyously
called
yuki
san
god
bless
you
the
girl
stood
still
her
eyes
on
the
empty
gate
like
a
lonely
hurt
child
her
lip
quivered
and
she
caught
it
between
her
teeth
to
steady
it
ah
yuki
cried
her
mother
some
spirit
has
wished
you
harm
a
drop
of
blood
rests
on
your
lips
yuki
san
drew
her
hand
across
her
mouth
and
lightly
answered
that
maybe
a
robin
had
tried
to
steal
a
cherry
but
to
herself
she
murmured
my
heart
bleed
for
lonely
he
come
back
chapter
v
the
following
day
a
host
of
accumulated
duties
and
various
preparations
for
the
first
ceremonious
visit
of
the
kept
yuki
san
hands
and
mind
busy
and
if
sometimes
a
sob
rose
in
her
throat
or
her
eyes
strayed
wistfully
from
her
task
she
resolutely
refused
to
let
herself
dwell
upon
the
past
the
marriage
which
had
been
dutifully
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
and
looked
forward
to
as
a
financial
relief
to
the
entire
family
had
never
held
any
particular
interest
for
her
but
now
even
the
preparations
which
had
hitherto
excited
her
interest
and
enthusiasm
found
her
listless
and
indifferent
she
would
be
mistress
over
a
great
mansion
and
many
servants
and
her
days
were
to
be
spent
in
arranging
for
the
physical
comfort
of
saito
and
the
entertainment
of
his
friends
the
arrangement
had
seemed
so
simple
and
so
right
and
she
had
been
gratified
that
a
desirable
husband
had
been
found
but
now
she
could
neither
understand
nor
explain
to
herself
her
new
and
strange
resistance
she
only
knew
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
there
was
rebellion
against
the
inevitable
as
she
rested
her
tired
body
before
beginning
her
toilet
for
the
afternoon
she
remembered
an
american
teacher
at
school
who
had
been
with
the
man
she
was
soon
to
marry
she
remembered
how
she
had
hidden
behind
the
trees
to
see
this
young
teacher
run
to
the
gate
to
meet
the
postman
and
her
own
failure
to
see
why
these
letters
should
bring
such
joy
she
with
other
girls
had
spent
a
whole
recess
acting
this
scene
amid
peals
of
laughter
now
it
all
came
back
to
her
with
new
meaning
and
it
seemed
neither
strange
nor
amusing
she
leaned
her
head
against
the
open
and
looked
out
into
the
garden
radiant
and
beautiful
in
the
high
noon
of
a
perfect
autumn
day
the
working
world
paused
in
a
brief
sleep
and
the
music
of
the
garden
was
hushed
while
the
insects
sought
the
shadow
of
green
leaves
peace
was
within
and
without
save
in
the
girl
awakening
heart
ah
sensei
she
murmured
through
her
trembling
lips
then
i
make
fun
for
your
letter
of
love
forgive
my
impolite
now
i
the
understanding
have
yuki
san
chose
her
toilet
for
the
coming
visit
with
due
regard
for
all
convention
there
must
be
no
touch
of
purple
that
being
the
color
soonest
to
fade
made
it
an
evil
omen
she
selected
an
of
rare
brocade
the
betrothal
gift
of
saito
the
great
length
of
which
expressed
the
hope
of
an
enduring
marriage
as
she
dressed
her
mother
flitted
about
her
chatting
volubly
and
in
such
high
spirits
that
yuki
san
heart
was
warmed
the
elaborate
trousseau
had
caused
the
little
household
many
a
sacrifice
but
the
joy
in
the
hearts
of
the
old
people
more
than
justified
them
presently
the
clatter
of
the
jinrikisha
in
the
courtyard
announced
the
arrival
of
the
guest
yuki
san
heard
the
long
ceremonious
greeting
of
her
father
she
saw
her
mother
hasten
away
to
do
her
part
and
left
alone
she
sat
with
troubled
eyes
and
drooping
head
the
strange
feeling
in
her
heart
one
moment
of
joy
and
one
of
pain
bewildered
and
frightened
her
no
thought
of
evading
her
duty
crossed
her
mind
but
her
whole
being
cried
out
for
a
beautiful
something
she
had
just
found
but
which
it
was
futile
to
hope
for
in
her
new
life
at
the
call
of
her
mother
yuki
san
silently
pushed
open
the
screen
and
made
her
low
and
graceful
greeting
custom
forbidding
her
to
take
part
in
the
conversation
she
busied
herself
with
serving
the
tea
listening
while
saito
san
recounted
various
incidents
of
the
picturesque
or
told
of
adventures
in
the
recent
war
after
all
the
prescribed
topics
had
been
discussed
and
the
farewells
had
been
said
yuki
san
retained
a
vague
impression
of
a
small
man
with
many
medals
on
his
breast
who
looked
at
her
with
kind
unsmiling
eyes
it
was
not
till
after
the
simple
evening
meal
that
yuki
san
found
the
chance
to
slip
away
to
the
little
upper
room
which
had
been
for
two
months
nothing
there
had
been
touched
for
the
old
mother
claimed
that
to
set
a
room
in
order
too
soon
after
a
guest
departure
was
to
sweep
out
all
luck
with
him
the
girl
entered
and
stood
a
ghostly
image
in
the
soft
and
tender
light
of
the
great
autumn
moon
as
it
lay
against
the
paper
doors
and
filled
the
tiny
room
through
the
yuki
san
saw
many
touches
of
the
late
inmate
personality
a
discarded
tie
hung
limply
from
a
hook
on
the
wall
a
cigar
and
a
faded
white
rose
lay
side
by
side
on
the
low
table
from
the
garden
the
sad
call
of
a
with
its
wail
seemed
to
voice
her
loneliness
and
with
a
sob
she
sank
upon
her
knees
beside
the
cot
long
she
lay
in
an
abandonment
of
grief
beating
futile
wings
against
the
bars
of
fate
at
last
throwing
out
her
arms
she
touched
a
small
object
beneath
the
pillow
drawing
it
toward
her
she
took
it
to
the
open
and
by
the
bright
moonlight
she
saw
a
small
morocco
she
puzzled
over
the
strange
figures
on
the
first
few
pages
but
from
the
small
pocket
on
the
back
cover
she
drew
forth
a
picture
that
neither
confused
nor
surprised
it
was
the
girl
merrit
had
told
her
about
the
girl
to
whom
he
was
going
so
joyously
it
was
a
face
full
of
the
gladness
of
life
and
love
whose
laughing
eyes
looked
straight
into
yuki
san
with
such
a
challenge
of
friendship
and
good
will
that
the
girl
smiled
back
at
the
picture
and
laid
it
gently
against
her
warm
cheek
she
sought
out
each
detail
of
hair
and
dress
as
she
held
it
for
closer
inspection
then
replacing
it
in
the
pocket
she
said
softly
he
have
the
big
big
love
for
you
you
give
him
the
happy
i
close
my
heart
about
you
on
the
back
of
the
book
in
letters
of
gold
she
spelled
out
the
strange
word
diary
she
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
she
remembered
where
she
had
seen
it
before
the
young
american
teacher
had
written
in
just
such
a
book
and
when
she
asked
its
meaning
the
teacher
had
said
it
was
her
best
friend
her
confidant
to
whom
she
told
her
secrets
for
a
moment
yuki
san
stood
with
the
book
in
her
hand
then
she
said
impulsively
diary
i
make
diary
too
i
speak
my
thoughts
to
you
i
tole
you
all
my
secrets
maybe
my
lonely
heart
will
flew
away
chapter
vi
the
diary
of
yuki
san
sensei
say
she
have
one
closest
friend
in
little
book
i
tell
my
troublesome
to
this
little
book

gold
letters
on
back
i
make
it
my
closest
friend
what

the
words

when

overflows
with
several
feelings
i

san
but

japanese

me
to

i
expect
in
dreamy
way
i
have
the
feel
of
very
helpless
and
lonesome
before
though
i
had
some
trouble
or
unhappiness
if
i
saw
merrit
san
smile
everything
was
taken
clear
away
and
my
heart
was
full
with
cheer
and
happy
ah

san
though
it
makes
my
cheek
red
with
hot
to
write

naughty
old
god
to
say
nothing

japanese
girl
have
the
much
brave
and

the
content
this

i
take

by

last
time
i
take

come
with
us
i
make
into
japanese
words
all
merrit
san
funny
speaks
we
have
the
much
laugh
merrit
san
try
the
eat
with
little
boat
what
we
ride
the
water
in
was
broke
by
its
nose
and
many

was
eating
it
up
loud
cold
wind
make
shivery
and
sad
big
gray
cloud
come
down
and
make
all
black
with
sorrowful
sometimes
little
white
waves
jump
up
and
dance
but
the
joyful
of
last
happy
day
stings
my
heart
more
long
time
go
running
slowly
by
since
you
have
left
us
and
as
i
was
thinking
of
that
running
and
those
days
and
longing
for
you
and
my
heart
getting
down
in
lonely
thoughts
san
bring
me
those
package
what
you

merrit
san
and
it
made
me
very
glad
and
happy
hardly
can
i
tell
what
was
in
my
heart
then
before
i
can
open
it
i
hold
it
tightly
against
my
breast
and
kept
silence
a
little
while
tears
of
sorrow
changed
into
the
great
joy
for
a
moment
when
i
see
your
name
and
your
hand
of
write
i
feel
as
if
i
receive
a
new
life
right
in
this
minute
and
i
caught
a
light
of
hope
in
yonder
my
heartful
joy
and
gladness

not
express
and
i
wish

joyful
of

in
my
heart
little
book
i
weared
you
close
to
my
breast
many
days
i
sleep
with
you
tight
to
my
heart
you
gived
me
the
courage
to
turn
my
face
to
the
rising
sun
of
the
chapter
vii
the
low
deep
music
of
a
temple
bell
rolled
down
the
hillside
and
echoed
through
the
giant
cryptomerias
it
stirred
to
action
the
creatures
of
the
early
dawn
and
passed
out
with
infinite
sweetness
to
the
east
of
another
day
the
priests
in
the
old
temples
chanted
their
prayers
with
weird
monotony
while
a
single
bird
poured
out
his
morning
song
of
love
at
the
door
of
his
mate
the
old
stone
steps
leading
from
temple
to
temple
would
have
looked
as
they
had
a
thousand
other
mornings
gray
grim
and
mossy
save
for
a
little
figure
that
slowly
took
its
way
up
a
long
and
crooked
flight
yuki
san
was
on
her
way
to
make
good
her
promise
to
the
gods
her
wooden
shoes
clicked
sharply
in
the
quiet
morning
air
then
hushed
as
she
paused
for
rest
on
a
broad
step
even
the
exertion
of
the
long
climb
had
failed
to
color
her
white
cheeks
but
her
lips
were
carmine
and
her
eyes
luminous
with
purpose
the
one
spot
of
color
about
her
otherwise
sober
little
figure
was
a
held
close
in
which
something
was
carefully
wrapped
a
noisy
waterfall
leaped
past
her
down
the
hillside
in
a
perpetual
challenge
to
race
to
the
foot
images
grim
of
aspect
stared
at
her
as
she
climbed
but
yuki
san
kept
gravely
on
her
way
until
she
reached
the
open
door
of
the
great
silent
temple
the
faint
light
of
the
early
morning
had
scarce
penetrated
the
shadows
that
clung
about
the
gorgeous
hangings
and
rich
symbols
of
this
ancient
place
of
worship
a
priest
oblivious
to
all
save
his
own
meditations
paid
little
heed
to
the
childlike
figure
as
it
knelt
before
the
cold
calm
unchanging
image
of
the
great
buddha
for
a
moment
yuki
san
moved
her
lips
still
kneeling
she
drew
from
her
sash
the
red
and
took
from
it
a
small
morocco
with
light
steps
she
crossed
to
a
brazier
and
with
a
pair
of
small
tongs
lifted
from
it
a
glowing
coal
with
steady
fingers
she
pushed
aside
the
many
sticks
of
incense
in
the
great
brass
vessel
before
the
shrine
and
making
a
little
grave
among
the
ashes
she
laid
within
the
burning
coal
the
little
book
the
blue
smoke
rising
slowly
hung
for
a
moment
above
the
girl
head
as
a
halo
then
rose
to
the
feet
of
buddha
as
in
supplication
for
mercy
and
was
finally
lost
in
the
darkness
of
the
heavy
roof
the
girl
watched
with
wide
eyes
and
parted
lips
clasping
her
hands
she
lifted
her
face
and
from
her
heart
came
a
fervent
whispered
prayer
i
make
empty
my
heart
of
all
wicked
buddha
or
christians
god
i
no
can
know
which
please
the
more
better
speak
into
my
lonely
life
the
word
of
peace
she
turned
from
the
silent
temple
on
her
homeward
way
she
paused
by
the
clump
of
bamboo
where
so
short
a
time
before
she
had
gleefully
tied
together
two
boughs
in
the
name
of
merrit
and
herself
tiptoeing
to
reach
the
high
boughs
which
merrit
had
held
for
her
to
tie
she
drew
them
downward
to
slip
the
thong
that
bound
them
after
holding
them
to
her
soft
cheek
a
moment
she
let
them
fly
apart
while
she
closed
her
eyes
and
whispered
softly
beautiful
love
