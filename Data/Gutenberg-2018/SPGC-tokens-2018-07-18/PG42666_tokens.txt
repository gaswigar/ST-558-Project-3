who
would
ever
think
of
going
to
such
a
place
why
you
will
be
eaten
up
by
cannibals
what
on
earth
makes
you
choose
such
an
outlandish
part
of
the
world
to
go
to
what
can
be
the
attraction
why
it
is
thousands
of
miles
away
and
no
one
has
ever
been
there
before
except
captain
musters
and
one
or
two
other
adventurous
madmen
these
and
similar
questions
and
exclamations
i
heard
from
the
lips
of
my
friends
and
acquaintances
when
i
told
them
of
my
intended
trip
to
patagonia
the
land
of
the
giants
the
land
of
the
fabled
golden
city
of
manoa
what
was
the
attraction
in
going
to
an
outlandish
place
so
many
miles
away
the
answer
to
the
question
was
contained
in
its
own
words
precisely
because
it
was
an
outlandish
place
and
so
far
away
i
chose
it
palled
for
the
moment
with
civilisation
and
its
surroundings
i
wanted
to
escape
somewhere
where
i
might
be
as
far
removed
from
them
as
possible
many
of
my
readers
have
doubtless
felt
the
dissatisfaction
with
oneself
and
everybody
else
that
comes
over
one
at
times
in
the
midst
of
the
pleasures
of
life
when
one
wearies
of
the
shallow
artificiality
of
modern
existence
when
what
was
once
excitement
has
become
so
no
longer
and
a
longing
grows
up
within
one
to
taste
a
more
vigorous
emotion
than
that
afforded
by
the
monotonous
round
of
society
pleasures
well
it
was
in
this
state
of
mind
that
i
cast
round
for
some
country
which
should
possess
the
qualities
necessary
to
satisfy
my
requirements
and
finally
i
decided
upon
patagonia
as
the
most
suitable
without
doubt
there
are
wild
countries
more
favoured
by
nature
in
many
ways
but
nowhere
else
are
you
so
completely
alone
nowhere
else
is
there
an
area
of
square
miles
which
you
may
gallop
over
and
where
whilst
enjoying
a
healthy
bracing
climate
you
are
safe
from
the
persecutions
of
fevers
friends
savage
tribes
obnoxious
animals
telegrams
letters
and
every
other
nuisance
you
are
elsewhere
liable
to
be
exposed
to
to
these
attractions
was
added
the
thought
always
alluring
to
an
active
mind
that
there
too
i
should
be
able
to
penetrate
into
vast
wilds
virgin
as
yet
to
the
foot
of
man
scenes
of
infinite
beauty
and
grandeur
might
be
lying
hidden
in
the
silent
solitude
of
the
mountains
which
bound
the
barren
plains
of
the
pampas
into
whose
mysterious
recesses
no
one
as
yet
had
ever
ventured
and
i
was
to
be
the
first
to
behold
them
an
egotistical
pleasure
it
is
true
but
the
idea
had
a
great
charm
for
me
as
it
has
had
for
many
others
thus
under
the
combined
influence
of
the
above
considerations
it
was
decided
that
patagonia
was
to
be
the
chosen
field
of
my
new
experiences
my
party
consisted
of
lord
queensberry
and
lord
james
douglas
my
two
brothers
my
husband
and
myself
and
a
friend
beerbohm
whose
book
in
had
just
been
published
when
we
left
england
we
only
took
one
servant
with
us
knowing
that
english
servants
inevitably
prove
a
nuisance
and
hindrance
in
expeditions
of
the
kind
when
a
great
deal
of
roughing
it
has
to
be
gone
through
as
they
have
an
unpleasant
knack
of
falling
ill
at
inopportune
moments
our
outfit
was
soon
completed
and
shipped
together
with
our
other
luggage
on
board
the
good
ship
britannia
which
sailed
from
liverpool
on
the
december
we
ourselves
were
going
overland
to
join
her
at
bordeaux
as
we
thereby
had
a
day
longer
in
england
then
came
an
unpleasant
duty
taking
leave
of
our
friends
i
hate
saying
on
the
eve
of
a
long
journey
one
can
not
help
thinking
of
the
uncertainty
of
everything
in
this
world
the
voice
that
bids
you
may
before
you
return
perhaps
be
silent
for
ever
the
face
of
each
friend
who
grasps
your
hand
vividly
recalls
some
scene
of
pleasant
memory
now
it
reminds
you
of
some
hot
august
day
among
the
purple
hills
of
scotland
when
a
good
bag
before
an
excellent
lunch
had
been
followed
by
some
more
than
usually
exciting
sport
the
highlands
had
never
looked
so
beautiful
so
merry
a
party
had
never
clambered
down
the
moors
homeward
so
successful
a
day
had
never
been
followed
by
so
jolly
an
evening
and
then
with
a
sigh
as
your
friend
leaves
you
you
ask
yourself
shall
i
ever
climb
the
moors
again
now
it
is
to
leicestershire
that
your
memory
reverts
the
merry
blast
of
the
huntsman
horn
resounds
the
rings
out
cheerily
on
the
bright
crisp
air
of
a
fine
hunting
morning
the
fox
is
gone
away
you
have
got
a
good
start
and
your
friend
has
too
come
on
he
shouts
let
us
see
this
run
together
side
by
side
you
fly
the
first
fence
take
your
horse
in
hand
and
settle
down
to
ride
over
the
broad
grass
country
how
distinctly
you
remember
that
run
how
easily
you
recall
each
fence
you
flew
together
each
you
topped
and
that
untempting
bottom
you
both
got
so
luckily
and
safely
over
and
above
all
the
old
where
the
gallant
fox
yielded
up
his
life
meanwhile
with
a
forced
smile
and
a
remark
you
part
and
together
perhaps
you
may
never
hear
the
horn
never
charge
the
never
strive
to
be
foremost
in
the
chase
again
with
these
thoughts
passing
through
my
mind
i
began
to
wonder
why
i
wanted
to
leave
england
i
remembered
for
the
moment
only
the
pleasant
features
of
the
past
and
remembering
them
forgot
the
feelings
and
circumstances
which
had
prompted
me
to
embark
on
my
present
enterprise
the
stern
sex
will
possibly
reprehend
this
exhibition
of
female
fickleness
of
purpose
may
i
urge
in
its
palliation
that
my
weakness
scarcely
lasted
longer
than
it
has
taken
me
to
write
this
on
a
cold
rainy
afternoon
we
steamed
down
from
bordeaux
in
a
little
tender
to
join
the
britannia
which
was
anchored
off
pauillac
we
were
soon
alongside
and
were
welcomed
on
board
by
captain
brough
under
whose
guidance
we
inspected
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
the
fine
ship
which
was
to
be
our
home
for
some
time
it
would
be
superfluous
for
me
to
describe
the
excellent
internal
arrangements
on
board
few
of
my
readers
i
imagine
but
are
acquainted
either
from
experience
or
description
with
the
sumptuous
and
comfortable
of
an
ocean
soon
the
anchor
was
up
the
propeller
was
in
motion
and
our
nerves
had
hardly
recovered
from
the
shock
inflicted
by
the
report
of
the
gun
which
fired
the
parting
salute
ere
pauillac
was
scarcely
distinguishable
in
the
mist
and
rain
astern
by
the
time
dinner
was
over
we
were
altogether
out
of
sight
of
land
the
rain
was
still
falling
heavily
and
prognostications
of
dirty
weather
were
being
indulged
in
by
the
sailors
giving
a
last
look
at
the
night
i
turned
into
the
captain
cosy
where
i
found
my
companions
deep
in
the
intricacies
and
wranglings
of
a
rubber
at
whist
in
which
i
too
presently
took
a
hand
as
time
went
on
indications
that
it
was
getting
rather
rough
were
not
wanting
in
the
swaying
of
the
ship
and
the
noise
of
the
wind
but
so
comfortable
were
we
in
our
little
cabin
with
the
curtains
drawn
and
lamps
lit
that
we
were
quite
astonished
when
the
captain
paid
us
a
visit
at
about
nine
and
told
us
that
it
was
blowing
a
regular
gale
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
the
ship
heeled
suddenly
over
under
a
tremendous
shock
which
was
followed
by
a
mighty
rush
of
water
along
the
decks
we
ran
out
thinking
we
must
have
struck
a
rock
the
night
was
as
black
as
pitch
and
the
roaring
of
the
wind
the
shouts
of
the
sailors
and
the
wash
of
the
water
along
the
decks
heightened
with
their
deafening
noise
the
anxiety
of
the
moment
fortunately
the
shock
we
had
experienced
had
no
worse
cause
than
an
enormous
sea
which
had
struck
the
ship
forward
and
swept
right
aft
smashing
whatever
opposed
its
destructive
course
and
bending
thick
iron
stanchions
as
if
they
had
been
mere
wires
as
soon
as
the
hubbub
attendant
on
this
incident
had
somewhat
subsided
thankful
that
it
had
been
no
worse
we
returned
to
our
game
at
whist
which
occupied
us
till
eleven
at
which
hour
all
lights
out
being
the
order
of
the
ship
we
turned
into
our
cabins
to
sleep
the
first
night
of
many
on
board
the
britannia
the
next
day
was
fine
and
sunny
and
so
the
weather
continued
till
we
reached
lisbon
three
days
after
leaving
bordeaux
when
it
grew
rather
rough
again
at
lisbon
we
remained
a
day
taking
in
coal
and
fresh
provisions
and
then
once
more
weighed
anchor
not
to
drop
it
again
till
the
shores
of
the
new
world
should
have
been
reached
just
as
it
was
beginning
to
dawn
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
after
leaving
lisbon
i
was
awakened
by
the
speed
of
the
vessel
being
reduced
to
half
its
usual
ratio
for
so
accustomed
does
one
become
in
a
short
time
to
the
vibration
of
the
screw
that
any
change
from
its
ordinary
force
immediately
disturbs
one
sleep
looking
out
of
my
i
could
see
that
we
were
close
to
land
so
dressing
hurriedly
i
went
on
deck
we
seemed
to
be
but
a
from
an
island
whose
bold
rugged
heights
rose
up
darkly
against
the
pale
light
that
shone
in
the
morning
sky
at
one
point
of
the
shore
the
revolving
light
of
a
beacon
flashed
redly
at
intervals
growing
fainter
and
fainter
each
time
as
day
slowly
broke
and
a
golden
haze
began
to
flood
the
eastern
horizon
in
the
darkness
the
island
looked
like
a
huge
bare
rock
but
daylight
showed
it
clothed
in
tolerably
luxuriant
vegetation
the
presence
of
man
was
indicated
by
the
little
white
houses
which
could
be
distinguished
nestling
in
crannies
of
its
apparently
steep
green
slopes
this
was
the
island
of
palma
one
of
the
canary
group
and
small
though
it
looked
it
numbers
a
good
many
inhabitants
and
furnishes
a
fair
contingent
of
emigrants
to
the
river
plate
where
canarios
as
they
are
called
are
favourably
looked
upon
being
a
skilful
industrious
race
the
days
slipped
quickly
by
and
soon
as
we
neared
the
equator
it
began
to
grow
intensely
hot
christmas
day
spent
in
the
tropics
did
not
rightly
appear
as
such
though
we
kept
it
in
the
orthodox
manner
the
preparing
quite
a
banquet
at
which
much
merriment
reigned
and
many
speeches
were
spoken
we
arrived
at
pernambuco
on
the
december
but
did
not
go
on
shore
as
we
were
only
stopping
in
the
port
a
couple
of
hours
and
were
told
moreover
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
when
one
is
there
we
amused
ourselves
watching
the
arrival
of
some
fresh
brazilian
passengers
who
were
going
with
us
to
rio
the
extensiveness
of
their
might
have
vied
with
that
of
solomon
in
all
his
glory
but
tall
hats
white
trousers
and
seemed
ludicrously
out
of
place
on
board
ship
not
less
funny
was
the
effusiveness
of
their
affectionate
at
parting
they
clasped
their
friends
to
their
breasts
interchanging
kisses
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
and
evincing
an
absence
of
in
the
presence
of
us
bystanders
which
was
at
once
edifying
and
refreshing
pays
autres
some
boatmen
came
alongside
bringing
baskets
of
the
celebrated
pernambuco
white
pineapples
we
bought
some
of
this
fruit
which
we
thought
delicious
it
is
the
only
tropical
fruit
which
in
my
opinion
can
vie
with

at
last
a
day
after
leaving
pernambuco
we
dropped
anchor
again
this
time
in
the
magnificent
bahia
de
todos
los
santos
the
ample
dimensions
of
which
make
its
name
a
not
inapposite
one
bahia
itself
is
built
on
a
high
ridge
of
land
which
runs
out
into
the
sea
and
forms
a
point
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
the
town
is
half
hidden
among
huge
banana
trees
and
cocoanut
palms
and
seen
from
on
board
looks
picturesque
enough
after
breakfast
our
party
went
on
shore
accompanied
by
the
captain
and
for
an
hour
or
so
we
walked
about
the
streets
and
markets
of
the
lower
town
which
stands
at
the
base
of
the
ridge
above
mentioned
we
found
it
as
dirty
and
ugly
as
could
well
be
and
our
sense
of
smell
had
no
little
violence
done
to
it
by
the
disagreeable
odours
which
pervaded
the
air
there
was
a
great
deal
of
movement
going
on
everywhere
and
the
streets
swarmed
with
black
slaves
male
and
female
carrying
heavy
loads
of
salt
meat
sacks
of
rice
and
other
merchandise
to
and
from
the
warehouses
which
lined
the
quays
they
all
seemed
to
be
very
happy
to
judge
by
their
incessant
chatter
and
laughter
and
not
overworked
either
i
should
think
for
they
were
most
of
them
plump
enough
the
women
especially
being
many
of
them
almost
inconveniently
fat
finding
little
to
detain
us
in
the
lower
town
we
had
ourselves
transported
to
the
upper
in
an
hydraulic
lift
which
makes
journeys
up
and
down
every
five
minutes
then
we
got
into
a
which
bowled
us
along
the
narrow
streets
at
a
famous
pace
soon
getting
clear
of
the
dirty
town
we
drove
along
a
pleasant
on
either
side
of
which
stood
pretty
little
villas
shaded
by
palms
and
and
encircled
by
trim
gardens
bright
with
a
profusion
of
tropical
flowers
now
and
then
we
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
too
and
as
we
went
along
we
found
the
tram
was
taking
us
out
to
the
extreme
point
of
the
ridge
mentioned
above
before
we
reached
it
we
had
to
change
our
conveyance
once
or
twice
as
occasionally
we
came
to
a
descent
so
steep
that
carriages
worked
up
and
down
by
hydraulic
machinery
had
been
established
to
ply
in
conjunction
with
the
ordinary
at
last
we
were
set
down
close
to
the
seashore
near
a
lighthouse
which
stands
in
a
commanding
position
on
the
point
the
view
which
was
now
before
us
was
a
splendid
one
the
immense
bay
lay
at
our
feet
and
beyond
spread
the
ocean
dotted
with
the
tiny
white
sails
of
numberless
catamarans
as
the
queer
native
are
called
which
looked
like
white
gulls
resting
on
its
blue
waters
but
the
heat
in
the
open
was
so
overpowering
that
we
soon
had
to
take
refuge
in
a
little
close
by
where
we
had
some
luncheon
after
which
we
went
back
to
bahia
the
way
we
had
come
by
no
means
sorry
to
get
on
board
the
cool
clean
ship
again
half
an
hour
after
our
arrival
the
anchor
was
weighed
and
we
steamed
off
for
rio
de
janeiro
new
year
day
like
christmas
day
was
passed
at
sea
and
we
celebrated
it
with
much
festivity
altogether
our
life
on
board
was
a
most
agreeable
one
thanks
to
the
kindness
and
attentions
of
the
captain
and
his
officers
and
the
days
flew
by
with
surprising
rapidity
four
days
after
leaving
bahia
we
sighted
land
off
rio
at
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
anxious
to
lose
nothing
of
the
scenery
i
had
risen
at
about
four
and
certainly
i
had
no
reason
to
repent
of
my
eagerness
we
had
passed
cape
frio
and
were
steaming
along
a
line
of
coast
which
runs
from
the
cape
up
to
the
opening
of
the
bay
thick
mists
hung
over
the
high
peaks
and
hills
shrouding
their
outlines
and
along
the
shore
the
surf
broke
with
a
sullen
roar
against
the
base
of
the
cliffs
which
fell
abruptly
down
to
the
sea
as
yet
all
was
grey
and
indistinct
but
presently
the
sun
which
for
a
long
time
had
been
struggling
with
the
mists
shone
victoriously
forth
the
fog
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
disclosing
bathed
in
the
glow
of
sunrise
a
grand
scene
of
cliffs
and
mountains
which
rose
range
beyond
range
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
front
of
us
lay
rio
harbour
with
the
huge
paõ
de
agucar
or
sugar
loaf
mountain
standing
like
a
gigantic
sentry
at
its
entrance
in
shape
it
is
exactly
like
the
article
of
grocery
from
which
it
takes
its
name
and
rises
abruptly
a
solid
mass
of
smooth
rock
to
a
height
of
feet
its
summit
long
considered
inaccessible
was
reached
by
some
english
middies
a
few
years
ago
much
to
the
anger
and
disgust
of
the
inhabitants
of
rio
these
adventurous
youngsters
planted
the
union
jack
on
the
highest
point
of
the
loaf
and
there
it
floated
no
one
daring
to
go
up
to
take
it
down
till
a
patriotic
breeze
swept
it
away
directly
opposite
is
the
fort
santa
cruz
which
with
its
guns
forms
the
principal
defence
of
the
harbour
soon
we
were
gliding
past
it
and
threading
our
way
through
the
numerous
craft
which
studded
the
bay
we
presently
dropped
anchor
in
front
of
rio
and
found
ourselves
at
leisure
to
examine
the
harbour
one
of
the
finest
and
largest
in
the
world
covering
a
space
of
sixteen
miles
in
a
north
and
south
direction
it
gradually
widens
from
about
of
a
mile
at
its
entrance
to
fifteen
miles
at
its
head
the
town
stands
on
the
western
side
of
the
bay
at
about
two
miles
from
its
entrance
it
is
backed
by
a
high
range
of
mountains
and
as
seen
from
the
bay
nestling
amidst
oceans
of
green
presents
a
most
pleasing
appearance
the
harbour
is
dotted
with
little
islands
and
all
along
its
shores
are
scattered
villages
country
seats
and
plantations
as
soon
as
the
captain
had
got
through
his
duties
we
took
our
places
in
his
boat
and
started
off
for
the
shore
on
landing
at
a
slippery
dirty
stone
causeway
we
were
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
negroes
who
jabbered
and
grinned
and
gesticulated
like
so
many
monkeys
making
our
way
through
their
midst
we
passed
by
the
and
then
threading
a
number
of
hot
dirty
little
streets
we
at
last
got
into
the
main
street
of
the
town
which
was
rather
broad
and
shaded
on
either
side
by
a
row
of
trees
the
public
buildings
at
rio
are
all
distinguished
by
their
peculiar
ugliness
they
are
mostly
painted
yellow
a
hue
which
seems
to
prevail
everywhere
here
possibly
in
order
to
harmonise
with
the
complexion
of
the
inhabitants
the
cathedral
forms
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
we
entered
it
for
a
moment
thinking
that
we
might
possibly
see
some
good
pictures
from
the
time
of
the
portuguese
dominion
but
we
found
everything
covered
up
in
brown
holland
nossa
senhora
da
francisca
or
whatever
virgin
saint
the
church
is
dedicated
to
was
evidently
in
and
we
could
see
nothing
though
we
could
smell
a
great
deal
more
than
was
agreeable
truly
i
did
not
envy
the
saints
their
odour
of
sanctity
to
my
mundane
nostrils
this
same
odour
smacked
strongly
of
garlic
and
other
abominations
we
soon
got
tired
of
wandering
aimlessly
about
and
feeling
little
desire
to
stop
in
the
town
any
longer
we
hired
a
carriage
and
started
off
for
a
little
place
called
tijuca
which
lies
high
up
among
the
hills
behind
rio
our
coach
was
drawn
by
four
fine
mules
who
galloped
along
the
streets
at
a
rattling
and
inasmuch
as
the
driver
was
evidently
an
unskilful
one
an
undesirable
pace
we
remonstrated
with
him
but
were
told
that
it
was
the
custom
of
the
country
to
drive
at
that
rate
so
in
deference
to
the
custom
of
the
country
on
we
went
at
full
gallop
shaving
twisting
round
sharp
corners
frightening
and
narrowly
missing
upsetting
or
being
upset
by
other
vehicles
which
came
in
the
way
i
was
quite
thankful
when
we
at
last
got
safely
clear
of
the
town
the
road
lay
amongst
the
most
beautiful
scenery
and
the
heat
though
considerable
was
not
oppressive
enough
to
interfere
with
my
enjoyment
of
it
after
a
couple
of
hours
driving
we
halted
to
give
the
mules
a
rest
near
a
little
brook
which
came
rippling
out
from
the
shady
mass
of
vegetation
which
lined
the
road
i
sat
down
under
a
banana
tree
letting
my
eyes
wander
in
lazy
admiration
over
the
scene
at
our
feet
we
had
gradually
got
to
a
good
height
above
rio
and
through
a
frame
of
leaves
and
flowers
i
could
see
the
town
the
blue
bay
studded
with
tiny
green
islands
and
beyond
the
rugged
mountains
with
a
light
mist
hanging
like
a
silver
veil
over
their
purple
slopes
when
the
mules
were
sufficiently
rested
we
got
into
the
carriage
and
starting
at
a
brisk
trot
it
was
not
long
before
we
got
to
the
summit
of
a
hill
at
the
foot
of
which
in
a
little
valley
lies
tijuca
before
reaching
it
a
rather
stiff
incline
had
to
be
descended
and
one
of
the
wheelers
either
blown
or
obstinate
refused
to
hold
the
carriage
back
the
driver
insisted
that
the
animal
was
only
showing
temper
and
commenced
to
flog
it
foreseeing
the
result
we
all
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
left
the
man
to
his
own
devices
he
persisted
in
whipping
the
recalcitrant
mule
and
as
might
have
been
expected
he
presently
started
the
other
animals
off
at
full
gallop
leaving
their
comrade
the
option
of
following
suit
or
falling
it
chose
the
latter
course
and
after
a
good
deal
of
slipping
and
sliding
went
down
with
a
tremendous
crash
the
other
three
taking
fright
immediately
bolted
and
we
soon
lost
sight
of
carriage
and
driver
in
a
cloud
of
dust
we
followed
on
down
the
hill
as
fast
as
we
could
rather
anxious
for
the
safety
of
the
driver
here
and
there
as
we
hurried
along
we
came
across
a
piece
of
broken
harness
and
presently
on
turning
a
sharp
corner
we
suddenly
came
upon
the
overturned
carriage
the
mules
struggling
and
kicking
in
a
confused
heap
and
the
driver
unhurt
but
frightened
sitting
in
the
grass
by
the
side
of
the
road
assistance
having
been
procured
from
tijuca
which
was
close
at
hand
the
mules
were
freed
and
the
carriage
raised
off
the
dragged
mule
which
we
expected
to
find
killed
to
our
surprise
however
no
sooner
were
its
limbs
at
liberty
than
it
sprang
up
and
began
to
crop
the
grass
in
utter
unconcern
as
to
the
numerous
wounds
all
over
its
body
a
horse
in
such
a
state
would
have
been
completely
cowed
and
would
probably
never
have
been
of
any
use
again
leaving
the
driver
to
make
the
best
of
his
position
we
walked
down
to
the
hotel
whyte
which
lies
snugly
ensconced
among
palms
and
at
tijuca
the
building
with
its
clean
cool
rooms
shaded
by
verandahs
looked
particularly
inviting
after
the
establishments
we
had
been
in
at
rio
and
it
was
pleasant
too
to
be
waited
on
by
englishmen
the
proprietor
and
his
staff
being
of
that
nationality
a
little
stream
runs
past
the
hotel
feeding
a
basin
which
has
been
hewn
out
of
the
rock
where
visitors
can
refresh
themselves
with
a
plunge
a
privilege
of
which
the
gentlemen
of
our
party
were
not
slow
to
profit
after
i
had
rested
a
little
i
strolled
away
among
the
woods
feasting
my
eyes
on
the
beauty
and
novelty
of
the
vegetation
and
on
the
delightful
glimpses
of
scenery
i
occasionally
stumbled
across
to
attempt
to
describe
which
would
only
be
doing
them
an
injustice
but
that
even
this
paradise
had
its
drawbacks
i
was
not
long
in
discovering
i
was
about
to
throw
myself
on
a
soft
green
bank
fringed
with
gold
and
silver
ferns
and
scarlet
begonias
that
stretched
along
a
sparkling
rivulet
when
suddenly
my
little
terrier
darted
at
something
that
was
lying
on
the
bank
and
pursued
it
for
a
second
till
my
call
brought
her
back
the
something
was
a
snake
of
the
cross
whose
bite
is
almost
instantaneously
fatal
and
as
i
quickly
retraced
my
steps
to
safer
ground
i
thanked
my
stars
that
i
had
been
spared
a
closer
acquaintance
with
this
deadly
reptile
when
i
got
back
i
had
a
swim
in
the
rocky
basin
above
mentioned
which
refreshed
me
wonderfully
soon
afterwards
we
sat
down
to
dinner
winding
up
the
day
by
a
cheery
musical
evening
before
going
to
bed
enticed
by
the
beauty
of
the
night
i
strolled
for
an
hour
or
more
among
the
woods
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
and
gradually
attracted
by
the
noise
of
falling
waters
i
made
my
way
to
a
little
cataract
which
coming
from
some
rocky
heights
above
dashed
foaming
into
a
broad
basin
and
swirling
and
bubbling
over
a
stony
bed
disappeared
below
in
the
shadows
of
a
lonely
glen
the
moon
which
was
now
shining
brightly
cast
a
pale
gleam
over
its
waters
and
myriads
of
fireflies
flashed
around
like
showers
of
sparks
not
a
sound
was
heard
save
the
roar
of
the
water
and
hardly
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
giant
foliage
of
the
sleeping
forests
for
a
long
time
i
sat
giving
myself
up
to
the
softening
influences
of
my
surroundings
and
thinking
amidst
the
splendour
of
that
warm
tropical
night
of
the
dear
old
country
far
away
now
no
doubt
covered
with
ice
and
snow
as
we
had
to
be
on
board
the
steamer
by
twelve
the
next
morning
the
carriages
were
ordered
for
eight
by
which
time
we
were
up
and
had
breakfasted
the
captain
my
husband
brother
and
myself
took
our
seats
in
a
carriage
drawn
by
two
mules
queensberry
and
following
in
a
victoria
having
said
to
whyte
we
told
our
driver
to
start
cautioning
him
as
he
was
the
same
jehu
who
had
driven
us
so
recklessly
the
day
before
to
be
more
careful
but
again
for
some
unaccountable
reason
he
cracked
his
whip
and
started
off
at
full
gallop
again
the
mules
bolted
and
like
lightning
we
went
down
a
little
incline
which
leads
from
the
hotel
to
the
road
then
a
sharp
turn
had
to
be
made
seeing
which
we
held
on
like
grim
death
to
the
carriage
an
upset
being
now
palpably
inevitable
on
we
went
the
carriage
heeled
over
balanced
itself
for
a
moment
on
its
two
left
wheels
and
then
catching
the
corner
of
a
stone
bridge
over
it
went
with
a
crash
burying
us
four
luckless
occupants
beneath
it
and
hurling
the
driver
into
the
brook
below
happily
the
shock
had
thrown
the
mules
as
well
for
had
they
galloped
on
huddled
as
we
were
among
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
the
accident
must
have
ended
in
some
disaster
as
it
was
we
had
a
most
miraculous
escape
the
driver
who
meanwhile
had
picked
himself
drenched
and
crestfallen
out
of
the
brook
came
in
for
a
shower
of
imprecations
which
his
stupidity
and
recklessness
had
well
earned
for
him
he
made
some
feeble
attempts
at
an
explanation
but
no
one
understood
him
and
he
only
aggravated
the
virulence
of
our
righteous
wrath
however
something
had
to
be
done
and
quickly
if
we
were
to
reach
the
steamer
by
twelve
the
victoria
was
now
the
only
conveyance
left
and
we
could
not
all
get
into
it
as
luck
would
have
it
whilst
we
were
debating
a
diligence
was
seen
coming
along
the
road
and
as
it
proved
there
were
sufficient
vacant
seats
to
accommodate
all
our
party
queensberry
and
myself
going
in
the
victoria
the
driver
having
assured
us
that
the
mules
were
perfectly
quiet
and
he
himself
appearing
a
steadier
sort
of
man
than
the
other
unfortunate
creature
we
felt
more
at
ease
and
certainly
at
first
start
all
went
smoothly
enough
but
strange
to
say
we
were
doomed
to
incur
a
third
upset
when
we
came
to
a
steep
descent
instead
of
driving
slowly
our
coachman
for
some
inexplicable
reason
actually
urged
his
animals
into
a
gallop
we
called
to
him
to
stop
but
that
was
already
beyond
his
power
the
mules
having
again
bolted
and
to
make
matters
still
more
desperate
one
of
the
reins
broke
leaving
us
completely
at
the
mercy
of
accidents
the
road
wound
down
the
side
of
a
steep
hill
and
each
time
the
swaying
carriage
swung
round
one
of
the
sharp
curves
we
were
in
imminent
danger
of
being
dashed
over
the
roadside
down
a
precipice
three
hundred
feet
in
depth
the
peril
of
this
eventuality
increased
with
our
momentum
and
as
the
lesser
of
two
evils
we
had
to
choose
jumping
out
of
the
carriage
this
we
did
at
a
convenient
spot
and
fortunately
though
we
were
all
severely
cut
and
bruised
no
bones
were
broken
in
another
second
the
coach
and
driver
would
have
disappeared
over
the
precipice
had
not
one
of
the
mules
suddenly
fallen
and
acting
as
a
drag
on
the
coach
enabled
the
driver
to
check
the
other
mule
just
in
the
nick
of
time
to
meet
with
three
accidents
in
hours
was
rather
too
much
of
a
good
thing
and
vowing
that
we
had
had
enough
of
brazilian
coachmanship
to
last
us
all
our
lives
we
completed
the
rest
of
the
way
on
foot
arriving
two
hours
after
the
appointed
time
on
board
the
old
britannia
we
presented
a
very
strange
appearance
our
clothes
torn
and
and
our
faces
covered
with
cuts
and
bruises
but
a
bath
and
a
little
soon
put
us
all
right
and
we
were
on
deck
again
in
time
to
have
a
last
look
at
rio
as
we
steamed
away

there
are
without

landscapes

the

around

are
insignificant
enough
and
one
need
not
go
out
of

in
search
for
charming
and
romantic
scenery
but
nowhere
have
the
rugged
and
the
tender
the
wild
and
the
soft
been
blended
into
such
exquisite
as
at

and
it
is
this
quality
of
unrivalled
contrasts
that
to
my
mind
gives
to
that
scenery
its
charm
of
unsurpassed
loveliness
nowhere
else
is
there
such
audacity
such
fierceness
even
of

coupled
with

four
days
after
leaving
rio
we
arrived
at
monte
video
but
as
we
came
from
an
infected
port
we
were
put
into
quarantine
much
to
our
disgust
and
were
of
course
unable
to
go
on
shore
after
we
had
discharged
what
cargo
we
carried
for
monte
video
we
proceeded
to
a
little
island
where
we
were
to
land
the
quarantine
passengers
amongst
whom
was
my
brother
queensberry
who
wanted
to
stop
in
monte
video
for
a
fortnight
following
us
by
the
next
steamer
the
quarantine
island
which
was
a
bare
rocky
little
place
did
not
look
at
all
inviting
and
i
certainly
did
not
envy
my
brother
his
stay
on
it
he
told
me
afterwards
that
he
had
never
passed
such
a
miserable
time
in
all
his
life
the
internal
domestic
arrangements
being
most
primitive
the
days
after
leaving
monte
video
passed
swiftly
enough
as
it
had
got
comparatively
cool
and
we
were
able
to
have
all
kinds
of
games
on
deck
after
seven
days
at
sea
early
one
morning
we
sighted
cape
virgins
which
commands
the
entrance
to
the
straits
of
magellan
the
point
is
called
cape
espiritu
santo
the
distance
between
the
two
capes
being
about
miles
whilst
we
were
threading
the
intricate
passage
of
the
first
narrows
which
are
not
more
than
two
miles
broad
i
scanned
with
interest
the
land
i
had
come
so
many
thousand
miles
to
see
patagonia
at
last
desolate
and
dreary
enough
it
looked
a
succession
of
bare
plateaus
not
a
tree
nor
a
shrub
visible
anywhere
a
grey
shadowy
country
which
seemed
hardly
of
this
world
such
a
landscape
in
fact
as
one
might
expect
to
find
on
reaching
some
other
planet
much
as
i
had
been
astonished
by
the
glow
and
exuberance
of
tropical
life
at
rio
the
impression
it
had
made
on
my
mind
had
to
yield
in
intensity
to
the
vague
feelings
of
awe
and
wonder
produced
by
the
sight
of
the
huge
barren
solitudes
now
before
me
after
passing
the
second
narrows
elizabeth
island
so
named
by
sir
francis
drake
came
in
sight
its
shores
were
covered
with
wild
fowl
and
chiefly
shag
flocks
of
these
birds
kept
flying
round
the
ship
and
the
water
itself
through
which
we
passed
literally
teemed
with
gulls
and
every
imaginable
kind
of
we
were
soon
abreast
of
cape
negro
about
fourteen
miles
from
sandy
point
here
the
character
of
the
country
suddenly
changes
for
cape
negro
is
the
point
of
the
last
southerly
spur
of
the
cordilleras
which
runs
along
the
coast
joining
the
main
ridge
beyond
sandy
point
all
these
spurs
like
the
cordilleras
themselves
are
clothed
with
beech
forests
and
thick
underwood
of
the
magnolia
species
a
vegetation
however
which
ends
as
abruptly
as
the
spurs
from
the
sides
of
which
to
the
completely
bare
plains
there
is
no
graduation
whatever
as
we
went
along
we
passed
a
couple
of
canoes
containing
fuegians
the
inhabitants
of
the
tierra
del
fuego
but
they
were
too
far
off
to
enable
me
to
judge
of
their
appearance
though
i
should
have
liked
to
have
had
a
good
look
at
them
they
are
reputed
to
be
cannibals
and
no
doubt
justly
so
i
have
even
been
told
that
in
winter
when
other
food
is
scarce
they
kill
off
their
own
old
men
and
women
though
of
course
they
prefer
a
white
man
if
obtainable
at
one
we
cast
anchor
off
sandy
point
this
settlement
is
called
officially
by
the
chileans
to
whom
it
belongs
la
colonia
de
magellanes
it
was
formerly
only
a
penal
colony
but
in
consequence
of
the
great
increase
of
traffic
through
the
straits
the
attention
of
the
chilian
government
was
drawn
to
the
importance
the
place
might
ultimately
assume
and
accordingly
grants
of
land
and
other
inducements
were
offered
to
emigrants
but
the
colony
up
to
the
present
has
never
flourished
as
was
expected
and
during
a
mutiny
which
took
place
there
in
many
of
the
houses
were
burned
down
and
a
great
deal
of
property
destroyed
as
the
steamer
was
to
leave
in
two
hours
we
began
preparations
for
landing
but
meantime
the
breeze
which
had
sprung
up
shortly
after
our
arrival
freshened
into
a
gale
and
the
sea
grew
so
rough
that
it
was
impossible
to
lower
a
boat
and
the
lighters
that
had
come
off
shore
to
fetch
away
cargo
dared
not
go
back
the
gale
lasted
all
day
and
the
greater
part
of
the
night
calming
down
a
little
towards
three
in
the
morning
every
effort
was
accordingly
made
to
get
us
on
shore
the
alternative
being
that
we
should
have
to
go
on
with
the
steamer
to
valparaiso
the
company
regulations
not
allowing
more
than
a
certain
length
of
time
to
be
spent
at
sandy
point
as
may
be
imagined
we
by
no
means
liked
the
idea
of
such
a
possible
consummation
and
the
weather
was
eagerly
scanned
whilst
our
luggage
and
traps
were
being
hurried
over
the
sides
as
a
fresh
increase
in
the
strength
of
the
wind
would
have
been
fatal
at
last
all
was
ready
we
said
to
the
captain
and
officers
to
whose
kindness
during
the
voyage
we
were
so
much
indebted
for
our
enjoyment
of
our
trip
on
board
the
britannia
and
climbing
down
the
gangway
took
our
seats
in
the
boat
which
was
to
carry
us
ashore
i
felt
quite
sad
as
we
rowed
away
leaving
behind
us
the
good
ship
which
we
had
come
to
look
upon
as
a
home
and
for
which
i
at
least
felt
almost
a
personal
affection
after
a
long
pull
during
which
the
contrary
wind
and
tide
bade
fair
to
set
at
nought
the
efforts
of
the
four
strong
sailors
who
rowed
us
ashore
we
at
last
came
alongside
the
old
wooden
pier
which
forms
the
landing
stage
at
sandy
point
we
succeeded
in
reaching
its
end
without
incurring
any
mishap
though
we
ran
considerable
risk
from
the
many
dangers
with
which
it
bristled
in
the
shape
of
sudden
yawning
holes
and
treacherously
shifting
planks
this
pier
however
had
the
merit
a
questionable
one
it
is
true
of
being
in
keeping
with
the
appearance
and
condition
of
the
whole
colony
to
which
it
served
as
a
warning
introduction
i
suppose
there
possibly
may
be
drearier
looking
places
than
the
town
of
sandy
point
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
probable
and
as
we
walked
over
the
beach
in
front
of
the
settlement
and
surveyed
the
gloomy
rows
of
miserable
wooden
huts
the
silent
solitary
streets
where
at
that
moment
not
a
single
living
being
was
to
be
seen
save
some
we
all
agreed
that
the
epithet
of
hole
was
the
only
description
that
did
justice
to
the
merits
of
this
desolate
place
nor
did
subsequent
and
fuller
acquaintance
with
it
by
any
means
induce
us
to
alter
this
unfavourable
opinion
proceeding
under
the
guidance
of
dunsmuir
the
english
consul
we
halted
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
pier
at
a
house
which
we
were
informed
was
the
principal
shop
and
inn
in
the
place
it
was
not
an
ambitious
establishment
its
interior
consisted
of
a
containing
two
rooms
of
which
one
served
as
a
shop
and
the
other
as
a
sitting
room
this
last
apartment
we
secured
as
a
storeroom
for
our
luggage
and
equipments
and
there
also
we
ate
our
meals
during
our
sojourn
in
sandy
point
the
upper
portion
of
this
magnificent
dwelling
was
a
kind
of
loft
in
one
corner
of
which
was
a
small
compartment
which
my
brother
and
used
as
a
bedroom
through
the
kindness
of
dunsmuir
my
husband
and
myself
were
lodged
very
comfortably
in
his
own
house
our
first
experience
of
roughing
it
in
the
shape
of
the
breakfast
with
which
pedro
the
innkeeper
supplied
us
being
over
we
sauntered
up
through
the
streets
of
the
colony
to
the
house
of
dunsmuir
from
which
as
it
stands
on
high
ground
we
obtained
a
good
view
of
the
straits
and
the
opposite
shores
of
the
tierra
del
fuego
the
britannia
had
already
weighed
anchor
and
for
a
long
time
we
watched
her
steaming
away
through
the
straits
till
growing
gradually
smaller
and
smaller
she
at
last
disappeared
in
the
haze
of
the
distant
horizon
and
now
that
the
last
link
as
it
were
of
the
chain
which
bound
me
to
old
england
was
gone
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
fully
the
fact
that
we
were
ten
thousand
miles
away
from
our
home
and
our
friends
alone
amidst
strange
faces
and
wild
scenes
and
it
required
almost
an
effort
to
banish
the
impression
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
dream
from
which
i
was
presently
to
awaken
and
find
myself
back
in
england
again
our
anxiety
to
leave
sandy
point
as
soon
as
possible
hastened
preparations
we
had
to
make
before
starting
but
even
with
every
wish
to
get
away
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
that
we
calculated
we
should
not
be
ready
to
start
for
at
least
four
days
there
were
guides
to
be
found
good
dogs
to
be
bought
and
above
all
suitable
horses
to
be
hired
or
purchased
numbers
of
these
latter
animals
were
brought
for
our
inspection
from
among
which
we
selected
about
fifty
of
whose
merits
and
failings
i
shall
have
to
speak
at
a
later
occasion
we
found
the
charges
for
everything
ridiculously
high
and
though
no
doubt
we
were
cheated
on
all
sides
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
accept
the
prices
and
conditions
demanded
as
guides
were
not
plentiful
and
the
other
necessities
procurable
nowhere
else
a
whole
day
was
spent
in
unpacking
the
provisions
and
equipments
we
had
brought
from
england
and
in
putting
them
into
canvas
bags
so
as
to
be
conveniently
portable
on
horseback
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
may
contemplate
an
expedition
similar
to
ours
i
give
the
following
list
of
the
articles
and
provisions
we
took
with
us
we
limited
ourselves
i
may
say
to
such
things
as
were
absolutely
indispensable
the
disadvantages
arising
from
being
burdened
with
unnecessary
luggage
on
such
a
trip
being
two
small
tents
hatchets
pail
iron
pot
for
cooking
saucepan
biscuits
coffee
tea
sugar
flour
oatmeal
preserved
milk
and
a
few
tins
of
butter
kegs
of
whisky
to
the
above
we
added
a
sack
of
yerba
maté
of
which
herb
we
all
grew
so
fond
that
we
ultimately
used
it
to
the
complete
exclusion
of
tea
and
coffee
although
at
first
we
by
no
means
agreed
with
the
enthusiastic
description
of
its
merits
given
by
at
whose
recommendation
we
had
taken
it
our
personal
outfit
consisted
in
addition
to
a
few
changes
of
woollen
underclothing
in
a
mantle
a
rug
or
two
a
and
revolver
besides
of
course
the
guns
and
rifles
we
had
brought
for
sporting
purposes
the
cartridges
for
the
latter
of
which
we
had
a
great
number
formed
the
heaviest
item
of
weight
but
notwithstanding
the
care
we
had
used
in
our
calculations
so
as
not
to
take
more
provisions
than
we
wanted
the
goodly
pile
which
was
formed
when
all
our
luggage
was
heaped
together
was
rather
alarming
and
we
found
that
twelve
horses
at
least
would
be
required
to
carry
it
fortunately
we
were
able
to
procure
three
mules
who
between
them
carried
more
than
six
horses
could
have
done
without
moreover
suffering
half
as
much
as
the
latter
in
condition
from
fatigue
or
the
severe
heat
which
we
occasionally
encountered
we
selected
our
guides
from
among
a
number
who
offered
their
services
we
chose
four
two
frenchmen
an
argentine
gaucho
and
a
nondescript
creature
an
inhabitant
of
sandy
point
by
name
who
had
accompanied
captain
musters
on
his
expedition
this
was
a
being
of
over
sixty
but
he
proved
a
useful
servant
notwithstanding
his
age
he
was
a
beautiful
rider
and
considering
his
years
wonderfully
active
and
enduring
as
long
as
we
remained
in
sandy
point
however
he
was
of
little
use
to
us
as
he
was
never
by
any
chance
sober
though
strange
to
say
when
once
we
left
the
settlement
he
became
a
total
abstainer
and
stoutly
refused
during
the
whole
of
the
trip
to
take
any
liquor
that
was
offered
to
him
his
face
the
skin
of
which
from
long
exposure
to
wind
and
weather
had
acquired
the
consistency
of
parchment
was
one
mass
of
wrinkles
and
burnt
almost
black
by
the
sun
while
the
watchful
cunning
expression
of
his
twinkling
eyes
added
to
his
wild
appearance
the
mephistophelian
character
of
which
earned
for
him
the
sobriquet
of
the
devil
agent
for
patagonia
he
had
passed
more
than
forty
years
of
his
life
on
the
pampa
and
was
therefore
well
qualified
to
act
as
guide
of
the
others
gregorio
gave
us
most
satisfaction
and
served
us
all
through
the
trip
with
untiring
zeal
and
fidelity
he
was
a
man
of
about
forty
and
added
to
the
other
accomplishments
of
his
craft
as
gaucho
a
slight
knowledge
of
english
his
ordinary
occupation
was
that
of
an
indian
trader
and
at
one
time
of
his
career
he
had
owned
a
small
schooner
with
which
he
used
to
go
in
the
season
one
of
the
frenchmen
françois
whose
original
profession
had
been
that
of
a
cook
proved
most
useful
to
us
in
that
capacity
and
played
the
changes
on
what
would
otherwise
have
been
a
slightly
monotonous
diet
of
guanaco
and
ostrich
meat
in
a
marvellous
manner
his
career
like
gregorio
had
been
a
chequered
one
after
having
served
during
the
war
as
a
chasseur
he
left
his
country
with
three
companions
to
start
some
business
in
south
america
on
the
failure
of
which
he
turned
his
attention
to
he
was
a
cheery
handsome
little
fellow
and
was
possessed
moreover
of
an
excellent
voice
and
whether
at
work
by
the
or
riding
on
the
march
was
always
to
be
heard
singing
merrily
he
owned
two
very
good
one
a
handsome
scotch
deer
hound
called
leona
the
other
a
black
wiry
dog
called
loca
a
cross
between
an
african
greyhound
and
an
english
lurcher
gregorio
had
only
one
dog
but
it
was
the
best
of
the
lot
often
managing
to
run
down
an
ostrich
singly
a
feat
which
requires
immense
stamina
and
gameness
and
which
none
of
the
other
dogs
were
able
to
perform
as
to
guillaume
i
need
say
nothing
except
that
all
our
party
disliked
him
very
much
after
four
days
hard
work
our
preparations
for
departure
were
nearly
completed
though
a
little
yet
remained
to
be
done
anxious
however
to
get
out
of
sandy
point
we
resolved
to
start
off
with
the
greater
part
of
the
packs
and
horses
and
to
await
the
coming
of
the
remainder
in
the
at
cabo

fifteen
miles
away

the
first
night
under
canvas
unexpected
arrivals
our
guests
a
novel
picnic
there
was
a
sound
of
revelry
by
night
early
in
the
morning
the
horses
were
driven
up
and
saddled
some
trouble
being
experienced
with
the
who
were
slightly
restive
taking
rather
unkindly
to
their
loads
at
first
as
our
guides
were
busy
hunting
up
the
requisite
number
of
horses
and
finishing
their
preparations
for
the
journey
we
took
another
man
with
us
for
the
time
that
we
should
have
to
remain
at
cabo
negro
as
well
as
a
little
boy
a
son
of
gregorio
to
help
to
drive
the
horses
along
after
a
hurried
breakfast
we
got
into
the
saddle
the
were
driven
together
not
without
a
great
deal
of
trouble
for
they
were
as
yet
strangers
to
each
other
and
every
now
and
then
one
or
two
would
bolt
off
a
signal
to
the
whole
troop
to
disperse
all
over
the
place
so
that
nearly
an
hour
had
elapsed
before
we
had
got
well
clear
of
the
colony
and
found
ourselves
riding
over
an
undulating
grassy
stretch
for
the
pampas
illustration
the
straits
of
magellan
our
way
lay
over
this
plain
for
about
an
hour
and
then
having
forded
a
small
stream
we
entered
the
outskirts
of
the
beechwood
forests
that
line
the
straits
the
foliage
of
the
trees
was
fresh
and
green
the
sky
clear
and
blue
the
air
and
buoyant
and
everything
seeming
to
augur
favourably
for
the
success
of
our
trip
we
were
all
in
the
best
of
spirits
our
road
presently
brought
us
down
to
the
straits
of
magellan
along
whose
narrow
strip
of
beach
in
some
places
barely
three
yards
broad
we
had
now
to
ride
in
single
file
along
the
coast
the
land
terminates
abruptly
and
the
trees
and
bushes
form
an
impenetrable
thicket
which
comes
down
almost
to
the
water
edge
point
after
point
shoots
out
into
the
sea
each
bearing
a
monotonous
resemblance
to
the
other
though
as
we
advanced
the
vegetation
that
covered
them
grew
more
and
more
stunted
and
scanty
till
at
last
the
trees
and
bushes
disappeared
altogether
and
after
a
three
hours
ride
we
found
ourselves
journeying
along
under
the
shadow
of
some
steep
bluffs
on
which
the
only
vegetation
was
a
profusion
of
long
coarse
grass
innumerable
species
of
gulls
and
albatrosses
were
disporting
themselves
on
the
blue
water
and
seemed
little
alarmed
at
our
approach
lazily
rising
from
the
water
a
moment
as
we
went
past
them
to
resume
almost
immediately
their
fishing
operations
all
along
the
beach
carried
there
by
the
sea
from
the
opposite
side
i
noticed
great
quantities
of
the
cooked
shells
of
crayfish
the
remains
of
many
a
meal
the
tierra
del
fuego
itself
was
distinctly
visible
opposite
and
at
different
points
we
could
see
tall
columns
of
smoke
rising
up
into
the
still
air
denoting
the
presence
of
native
encampments
just
as
magellan
had
seen
them
four
hundred
years
before
giving
to
the
island
on
that
account
the
name
it
still
bears
at
cabo
negro
we
stopped
for
a
moment
at
a
little
farmhouse
and
partook
of
some
maté
which
was
hospitably
offered
us
by
the
wife
and
then
mounting
again
we
galloped
over
a
broad
grassy
plain
where
some
sheep
and
cattle
were
grazing
till
we
came
to
a
steep
wooded
hill
on
its
crest
under
some
spreading
beeches
we
resolved
to
pitch
our
camp
water
being
near
at
hand
and
the
position
otherwise
favourable
in
a
short
time
the
were
relieved
of
their
loads
and
neighing
joyfully
they
galloped
away
to
graze
in
the
plain
we
had
just
crossed
our
tents
were
pitched
and
having
made
up
our
beds
in
them
so
as
to
have
everything
ready
by
we
began
to
set
about
preparing
dinner
wood
being
abundant
a
roaring
fire
was
soon
blazing
away
cheerily
some
meat
we
had
brought
from
sandy
point
was
put
into
the
iron
pot
together
with
some
rice
onions
and
then
we
lay
down
round
the
fire
not
a
little
fatigued
by
our
day
exertions
but
inhaling
the
grateful
odours
arising
from
the
pot
with
the
expectant
avidity
of
appetites
which
the
keen
patagonian
air
had
stimulated
to
an
unusual
extent
by
the
time
dinner
was
over
night
had
set
in
the
moon
had
risen
and
the
clear
sky
gave
assuring
promises
of
a
continuance
of
fine
weather
a
slight
breeze
stirred
the
branches
overhead
and
in
the
distance
we
could
hear
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
on
the
plains
and
the
faint
tinkling
of
the
bells
of
the
the
strange
novelty
of
the
scene
seemed
to
influence
us
all
and
the
men
smoked
their
pipes
in
silence
before
going
to
bed
i
went
for
a
short
stroll
to
the
shores
of
a
broad
lagoon
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
which
our
camp
was
pitched
its
waters
glittered
brightly
in
the
moonlight
but
the
woods
which
surrounded
it
were
sombre
and
dark
occasionally
the
sad
plaintive
cry
of
a
grebe
broke
the
silence
startling
me
not
a
little
the
first
time
i
heard
it
for
it
sounds
exactly
like
the
wail
of
a
human
being
in
pain
going
back
to
the
camp
i
found
my
companions
preparing
to
go
to
bed
an
example
i
was
not
slow
to
follow
and
soon
wrapt
up
in
our
robes
with
our
saddles
for
pillows
we
were
all
fast
asleep
it
had
been
agreed
that
the
next
morning
one
of
our
party
should
go
back
to
sandy
point
to
see
how
the
guides
were
getting
on
and
having
volunteered
to
perform
that
task
i
rose
at
an
early
hour
to
get
him
his
breakfast
and
see
him
off
on
his
journey
then
whilst
my
brother
and
husband
went
out
with
their
guns
to
shoot
i
busied
myself
writing
a
few
last
letters
to
friends
at
home
this
done
i
rode
down
to
the
straits
and
had
a
plunge
into
the
water
but
it
was
so
cold
that
i
got
quite
numbed
and
with
difficulty
managed
to
dry
and
dress
myself
late
in
the
afternoon
the
sportsmen
returned
bringing
an
excellent
bag
with
them
and
we
speedily
set
about
plucking
a
few
birds
and
making
other
preparations
for
dinner
just
as
that
meal
being
over
we
had
settled
ourselves
comfortably
round
the
fire
prepared
lazily
to
enjoy
the
lovely
evening
our
who
had
been
on
the
for
the
return
of
reported
that
a
troop
of
about
ten
horsemen
were
coming
our
way
as
indian
traders
do
not
go
out
to
the
pampas
in
such
large
parties
he
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
imagine
who
the
people
could
be
who
were
riding
out
so
late
at
night
especially
as
they
had
no
with
them
we
all
got
up
and
went
to
have
a
look
at
these
mysterious
horsemen
as
they
approached
the
foot
of
our
hill
we
could
see
that
they
were
all
armed
with
guns
and
rifles
a
circumstance
which
began
to
suggest
unpleasant
recollections
of
the
last
sandy
point
mutiny
could
it
be
that
another
outbreak
had
occurred
and
that
these
men
were
escaping
to
the
pampas
if
so
they
might
possibly
make
a
descent
on
us
in
passing
and
supply
any
deficiencies
in
their
own
outfit
from
ours
this
was
a
rather
startling
state
of
affairs
and
we
were
hurriedly
holding
counsel
as
to
what
was
the
best
course
to
take
under
the
circumstances
when
our
dogs
suddenly
started
up
and
began
barking
furiously
then
came
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
and
brushing
through
the
tall
furze
two
horsemen
galloped
straight
towards
our
camp
followed
as
the
sound
of
voices
told
us
by
the
rest
of
the
party
in
another
second
the
two
foremost
ones
reined
up
in
front
of
us
turning
out
to
be
not
bloodthirsty
mutineers
but
dunsmuir
and
beerbohm
a
few
words
explained
all
the
party
was
composed
of
some
officers
of
the
prinz
adalbert
a
german
which
had
anchored
at
sandy
point
that
morning
having
gone
on
board
and
invited
them
out
to
our
camp
for
a
day
shooting
delighted
at
this
solution
of
the
situation
we
hurried
to
welcome
our
new
guests
who
now
arrived
tired
and
hungry
after
their
long
ride
among
their
number
were
prince
henry
of
prussia
who
was
on
a
cruise
in
the
prinz
adalbert
and
her
commander
captain
maclean
fresh
logs
were
added
to
the
blazing
fire
meat
was
set
to
roast
soup
put
on
to
cook
and
every
preparation
made
for
a
good
supper
an
easy
task
as
the
officers
had
brought
plentiful
supplies
of
all
kinds
of
provisions
with
them
we
then
lay
round
the
fire
the
evidently
quite
charmed
by
our
cosy
sylvan
quarters
and
by
the
novelty
of
the
strange
picnic
which
they
had
little
anticipated
making
in
patagonia
of
all
places
in
the
world
i
was
much
amused
at
mr
b
account
of
how
the
expedition
had
been
initiated
he
had
got
into
sandy
point
at
about
nine
and
at
ten
the
prinz
adalbert
was
signalled
in
the
offing
as
soon
as
she
had
cast
anchor
he
went
on
board
having
been
previously
acquainted
with
the
captain
and
at
breakfast
explained
his
presence
in
such
an
part
of
the
world
as
sandy
point
by
an
account
of
our
intended
trip
and
finally
asked
the
captain
and
the
officers
to
come
out
to
our
camp
and
try
for
themselves
what
life
in
patagonia
was
like
he
had
little
difficulty
in
persuading
them
to
accept
his
offer
and
whilst
the
officers
made
their
preparations
he
went
on
shore
to
hunt
up
ten
horses
the
number
required
this
was
an
easy
matter
but
it
was
another
thing
to
find
as
many
saddles
for
though
many
people
in
sandy
point
own
numbers
of
horses
few
have
more
than
one
saddle
and
such
being
the
case
they
are
loth
to
lend
what
at
any
moment
may
be
of
pressing
necessity
for
themselves
however
by
dint
of
ingenious
combinations
some
kind
of
an
apology
for
a
saddle
was
fitted
to
each
horse
and
the
whole
party
at
last
set
off
on
their
trip
in
high
spirits
and
very
well
pleased
with
everything
each
officer
carried
a
blanket
or
rug
with
him
and
as
some
shooting
was
expected
a
gun
and
some
ammunition
for
the
first
two
hours
all
went
well
the
air
was
warm
and
sunny
the
scenery
novel
and
interesting
and
a
zest
was
given
to
the
expedition
by
its
unconventional
character
and
the
suddenness
with
which
it
had
been
improvised
but
after
a
time
the
hard
action
of
the
horses
and
the
roughness
of
some
of
the
saddles
began
to
have
their
effect
especially
as
many
of
the
officers
were
little
accustomed
to
riding
occasionally
would
be
asked
at
first
in
tones
of
implied
cheerful
unconcern
how
far
is
it
to
the
camp
to
this
question
he
would
reply
by
a
wave
of
the
hand
in
the
direction
of
one
of
the
many
points
which
shoot
out
along
the
straits
saying
a
little
beyond
that
point
then
as
point
after
point
was
passed
and
the
answer
to
inquiries
still
continued
as
before
a
little
beyond
that
point
gradually
the
laughter
and
chat
which
had
enlivened
the
outset
of
the
trip
grew
more
constrained
occasional
lapses
of
complete
silence
intervening
now
and
then
one
of
the
riders
would
move
uneasily
in
the
saddle
and
sigh
and
on
the
faces
of
many
especially
of
those
who
rode
stirrupless
saddles
fell
in
time
an
expression
of
fixed
resignation
to
suffering
which
was
not
unheroic
observed
all
this
and
his
conscience
began
to
smite
him
at
starting
in
an
amiable
endeavour
to
put
everything
in
a
rosy
light
he
had
slightly
understated
the
distance
to
our
camp
and
now
the
terrible
consequences
of
his
rashness
were
already
visiting
him
the
whom
he
was
leading
it
was
but
too
evident
were
only
bearing
up
against
suffering
by
the
comforting
consciousness
that
they
be
close
to
the
camp
he
could
not
undeceive
them
he
felt
himself
woefully
wanting
in
courage
enough
to
break
the
truth
and
yet
the
only
alternative
was
to
go
on
repeating
the
now
to
him
as
to
everybody
else
hateful
formula
a
little
beyond
that

his
victims
could
only
imagine
one
thing
that
he
had
lost
the

in
fact
he
knew
the
road
and
its
length
only
too
well

it

palpably

before
him
that
the

his
intentions
when
mystifying
the
party
as
to
the
length
of
the

had
been
of
the
best
however
all
things
come
to
an
end
and
at
last
with
a
feeling
of
deep
relief
he
was
able
to
point
out
our
hill
to
the
weary
band
whose
advent
as
possible
mutineers
had
thrown
us
into
such
a
panic
by
the
time
had
finished
his
story
supper
was
ready
and
that
important
fact
having
been
duly
announced
our
hungry
guests
fell
to
and
made
a
hearty
meal
the
strain
which
their
number
put
on
the
capabilities
of
our
de
was
fortunately
relieved
by
a
profusion
of
tinned
provisions
of
all
kinds
which
they
had
wisely
brought
with
them
and
under
those
patagonian
beeches
together
with
the
native
mutton
were
discussed
en
which
had
attained
their
delicate
flavour
under
the
mild
fostering
of
a
dutch
summer
elaborated
far
away
among
the
blue
alsatian
mountains
and
substantial
though
withal
subtly
flavoured
sausages
from
the
fatherland
itself
after
supper
pipes
were
lit
and
the
went
round
freely
the
woods
resounding
with
laughter
and
song
till
nearly
midnight
by
which
time
most
of
the
party
were
beginning
to
feel
the
effects
of
their
day
exertions
and
to
long
for
bed
in
one
of
our
tents
we
managed
to
make
up
four
couches
on
which
the
prince
the
captain
count
seckendorff
and
another
officer
respectively
laid
their
weary
limbs
and
went
to
sleep
as
best
they
might
the
captain
a
strong
stout
man
had
suffered
more
than
any
one
from
the
ride
and
it
must
have
been
a
moot
question
in
his
secret
heart
whether
the
day
enjoyment
had
not
been
somewhat
dearly
purchased
the
others
kept
up
the
ball
still
later
and
it
must
have
been
quite
two
before
the
last
rolled
himself
up
in
his
blanket
by
the
fire
and
silence
fell
over
our
camp
at
about
that
hour
i
peered
out
of
my
tent
at
the
scene
round
a
huge
heap
of
smouldering
logs
in
various
attitudes
suggestive
of
deep
repose
lay
the
forms
of
the
sleepers
whom
chance
had
thus
strangely
thrown
together
for
one
night
our
dogs
had
risen
from
their
sleep
and
in
their
turn
were
making
merry
over
whatever
bones
or
other
fragments
of
the
feast
they
managed
to
ferret
out
a
few
moonbeams
struggled
through
the
canopy
of
leaves
and
branches
overhead
throwing
strange
lights
and
shadows
over
the
camp
and
the
weird
effect
of
the
whole
scene
was
heightened
by
the
mysterious
wail
of
the
grebe
which
at
intervals
came
floating
up
in
the
air
from
the
lake
below
like
the
voice
of
an
unquiet
spirit

the

had
hardly
risen
the
next
morning
ere
our
little
camp
was
again
astir
making
a
hasty
toilet
i
stepped
out
and
found
that
our
guests
had
all
risen
and
were
busy
in
getting
their
guns
and
shooting
accoutrements
ready
for
the
coming
sport
as
soon
as
they
had
partaken
of
some
coffee
the
whole
party
started
off
to
the
plains
below
and
for
an
hour
or
so
till
their
return
the
repeated
reports
of
their
guns
seemed
to
indicate
that
they
were
having
good
sport
towards
they
came
back
fairly
satisfied
with
their
work
though
i
am
inclined
to
attribute
this
satisfaction
to
their
evident
desire
to
look
at
everything
connected
with
their
picnic
from
an
optimist
point
of
view
as
their
bag
was
in
reality
a
very
small
one
consisting
only
of
a
few
brace
of
snipe
and
we
then
set
to
work
to
get
a
good
breakfast
ready
at
which
employment
prince
henry
lent
an
intelligent
hand
turning
out
some
poached
eggs
in
excellent
style
we
had
a
very
pleasant
meal
the
officers
expressing
great
regret
that
they
were
unable
to
prolong
their
stay
in
our
beechwood
quarters
the
steamer
being
obliged
to
continue
her
journey
that
evening
whilst
they
smoked
a
last
pipe
the
horses
were
driven
up
and
saddled
and
at
about
eight
and
myself
accompanying
them
as
guides
they
mounted
and
set
out
on
the
road
homeward
the
stiffness
consequent
on
their
exertions
of
the
previous
day
must
have
made
the
sensations
they
experienced
on
returning
to
the
saddle
anything
but
pleasant
ones
and
at
the
start
a
decidedly
uncheerful
spirit
seemed
to
prevail
among
them
but
as
we
cantered
along
and
they
warmed
to
their
work
this
uneasiness
disappeared
and
soon
all
were
as
merry
as
possible
the
day
was
lovely
and
the
scenery
looked
to
the
best
advantage
the
only
drawback
to
our
enjoyment
of
the
ride
being
that
the
sun
was
rather
too
hot
after
we
had
gone
several
miles
we
got
off
our
horses
to
rest
under
the
shade
of
some
trees
by
the
side
of
a
little
stream
which
came
bubbling
out
of
the
cool
depths
of
the
forest
emptying
itself
into
the
adjacent
straits
here
an
incident
occurred
which
might
have
been
attended
with
inconvenient
consequences
one
of
the
officer
horses
suddenly
took
it
into
its
head
to
trot
off
and
before
any
one
could
stop
it
disappeared
round
a
point
in
the
direction
of
sandy
point
got
on
his
horse
and
started
in
pursuit
and
in
the
meanwhile
a
time
of
some
suspense
ensued
for
in
the
event
of
his
being
unsuccessful
some
unfortunate
would
have
had
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
on
foot
however
this
unpleasant
contingency
was
happily
avoided
soon
reappeared
having
managed
to
catch
the
runaway
not
indeed
without
a
great
deal
of
trouble
we
reached
sandy
point
late
in
the
afternoon
and
very
glad
the
whole
party
must
have
been
to
get
there
for
they
were
most
of
them
completely
done
up
and
considering
the
length
of
the
ride
their
rough
horses
and
rougher
saddles
this
was
no
wonder
after
having
said
to
the
officers
with
many
expressions
of
thanks
on
their
part
for
the
unexpected
diversion
our
presence
in
that
outlandish
part
of
the
world
had
afforded
them
and
i
immediately
set
out
to
return
to
the
camp
which
we
managed
to
reach
just
as
it
was
getting
dark
everything
was
now
ready
for
our
journey
and
it
was
resolved
that
we
should
make
a
start
the
next
morning
we
were
therefore
up
early
in
order
to
help
the
guides
as
much
as
possible
with
the
packing
which
was
quite
a
formidable
undertaking
it
took
fully
three
hours
to
get
our
miscellaneous
goods
and
chattels
stowed
away
on
the
whose
number
was
thirteen
at
last
however
all
was
ready
we
got
into
the
saddle
and
with
a
last
glance
at
the
beechwood
camp
which
had
grown
quite
familiar
and
to
us
we
rode
off
now
fairly
started
on
our
journey
into
the
unknown
land
that
lay
before
us
we
soon
had
our
hands
full
to
help
the
guides
to
keep
the
horses
together
a
rather
difficult
task
the
mules
in
particular
gave
great
trouble
and
were
continually
leading
the
horses
into
mischief
at
one
time
as
if
by
preconcerted
signal
the
whole
troop
dispersed
in
different
directions
into
the
wood
and
there
brushing
through
the
thick
underwood
many
of
the
upset
their
packs
and
trampled
on
the
contents
whilst
some
of
the
others
turned
tail
and
coolly
trotted
back
to
the
they
had
just
left
at
cabo
negro
all
this
was
very
provoking
but
with
a
little
patience
and
a
good
deal
of
swearing
on
the
part
of
the
guides
the
refractory
were
the
troop
was
got
together
again
and
by
dint
of
careful
driving
we
at
last
got
safely
out
of
the
wooded
country
and
emerged
on
the
rolling
pampa
where
there
was
for
some
distance
a
beaten
indian
track
along
which
the
horses
travelled
with
greater
ease
till
gradually
understanding
what
was
required
of
them
they
jogged
on
in
front
of
us
with
tolerable
steadiness
and
sobriety
which
was
only
occasionally
disturbed
by
such
slight
ebullitions
as
a
free
fight
between
two
of
the
stallions
or
an
abortive
attempt
on
the
part
of
some
hungry
animal
to
make
a
dash
for
some
particularly
knoll
of
green
grass
at
a
distance
off
the
line
of
our
march
illustration
collecting
the
saddling
up
the
country
we
were
now
crossing
was
of
a
totally
different
character
to
that
we
had
left
behind
us
not
a
tree
or
a
shrub
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
and
while
to
the
left
of
us
lay
the
rugged
range
of
the
cordilleras
in
front
and
to
the
right
an
immense
plain
stretched
away
to
the
horizon
rising
and
falling
occasionally
in
slight
undulations
but
otherwise
completely
and
monotonously
level
the
ground
which
was
rather
swampy
was
covered
with
an
abundance
of
coarse
green
grass
amongst
which
we
could
see
flocks
of
wild
geese
grazing
in
great
numbers
we
passed
several
freshwater
lakes
covered
with
who
flew
up
very
wild
at
our
approach
a
hawk
or
two
would
occasionally
hover
over
our
heads
and
once
the
dogs
started
off
in
pursuit
of
a
little
grey
fox
that
had
incautiously
shown
itself
but
except
these
there
was
no
sign
of
animal
life
on
the
silent
seemingly
interminable
plain
before
us
after
we
had
ridden
for
several
hours
we
turned
off
to
the
left
facing
the
cordilleras
again
and
soon
the
plain
came
to
a
sudden
end
a
broken
country
now
appearing
over
which
we
rode
till
nightfall
when
we
came
in
sight
of
the
despuntadero
the
extremity
of
peckett
harbour
an
arm
of
the
sea
which
runs
for
some
distance
inland
here
we
were
to
camp
for
the
night
and
as
we
were
all
rather
tired
and
hungry
after
our
long
ride
we
urged
on
our
horses
to
cover
the
distance
that
still
lay
between
us
and
our
as
quickly
as
possible
but
to
hasten
slowly
would
have
been
a
wiser
course
in
this
case
as
in
most
others
the
rapid
trot
at
which
we
now
advanced
disturbed
the
equilibrium
of
one
of
the
packs
the
cords
holding
which
had
already
become
slack
and
down
came
the
whole
pack
iron
pot
tin
plates
and
all
with
an
awful
clatter
whilst
the
mare
who
carried
it
terrified
out
of
her
wits
dashed
off
at
a
gallop
spurring
with
her
heels
her
late
encumbrances
and
followed
by
the
whole
troop
of
her
equally
frightened
companions
the
pampa
was
strewn
with
broken
bags
and
rice
biscuits
and
other
precious
stores
lay
scattered
in
all
directions
when
we
had
picked
up
what
we
could
and
replaced
the
pack
on
the
mare
who
in
the
meantime
had
been
caught
again
we
were
further
agreeably
surprised
by
the
sight
of
another
packless
animal
galloping
over
the
brow
of
a
distant
hill
followed
at
some
distance
by
gregorio
who
was
trying
to
lasso
it
whilst
was
descried
in
another
direction
endeavouring
to
collect
together
another
scattered
section
of
our
troop
off
we
scampered
to
aid
him
turning
on
the
way
to
drive
up
one
of
the
mares
whom
we
accidentally
found
grazing
with
her
foal
in
a
secluded
valley
the
guides
forgetting
by
the
guides
forgot
by
the
time
we
got
up
to
the
obstinacy
and
speed
of
the
refractory
animals
had
evidently
proved
too
much
for
him
inasmuch
as
we
found
him
sitting
under
a
bush
philosophically
smoking
a
pipe
in
answer
to
our
query
as
to
what
had
become
of
the
horses
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
in
the
direction
of
a
distant
line
of
hills
and
we
were
just
setting
off
on
what
we
feared
would
prove
a
rather
arduous
quest
when
a
welcome
tinkle
suddenly
struck
our
ears
and
the
troop
reappeared
from
the
depths
of
a
ravine
driven
up
by
francisco
who
had
providentially
come
across
them
in
time
to
intercept
their
further
flight
it
was
quite
dark
as
we
rode
down
and
pitched
our
camp
by
the
shore
of
the
inlet
above
mentioned
under
the
lee
of
a
tall
bluff
not
far
from
a
little
pool
of
fresh
water
after
the
tents
had
been
set
up
some
of
the
men
went
to
look
for
firewood
but
there
was
a
scarcity
of
that
necessary
in
the
region
we
were
now
in
and
the
little
they
could
collect
was
half
green
however
we
managed
to
make
a
very
fair
fire
with
it
and
our
dinner
was
soon
cooked
and
eaten
whereupon
we
retired
to
rest
the
next
morning
was
fine
and
we
resolved
to
stop
a
day
at
our
present
encampment
and
have
some
shooting
game
as
gregorio
informed
us
being
plentiful
in
that
region
after
a
light
breakfast
we
took
our
guns
and
started
off
in
the
direction
of
a
group
of
freshwater
lakes
which
lay
beyond
a
range
of
hills
behind
our
camp
we
were
rewarded
for
our
arduous
climb
by
some
excellent
sport
wild
geese
duck
being
very
plentiful
and
on
our
way
back
we
crossed
some
marshy
ground
where
there
were
some
snipe
several
brace
of
which
we
bagged
in
the
afternoon
it
being
rather
hot
and
sultry
we
refreshed
ourselves
with
a
bath
in
the
sea
and
then
came
and
by
seven
we
were
in
bed
and
asleep
the
following
day
we
continued
our
journey
northward
a
long
ride
brought
us
to
some
springs
called
pozos
de
la
reina
where
we
camped
for
the
night
after
we
had
rested
for
a
short
time
round
the
fire
and
had
leisure
to
look
at
one
another
we
became
aware
of
a
most
disagreeable
metamorphosis
that
had
taken
place
in
our
faces
they
were
swollen
to
an
almost
unrecognisable
extent
and
had
assumed
a
deep
purple
hue
the
phenomenon
being
accompanied
by
a
sharp
itching
the
boisterous
wind
which
we
had
encountered
during
the
day
and
which
is
the
standing
drawback
to
the
otherwise
agreeable
climate
of
patagonia
was
no
doubt
the
cause
of
this
annoyance
combined
possibly
with
our
bath
of
the
day
previous
after
a
few
days
the
skin
of
our
faces
peeled
off
completely
but
the
swelling
did
not
go
down
for
some
time
i
would
advise
any
person
who
may
make
the
same
journey
to
provide
themselves
with
masks
by
taking
this
precaution
they
will
save
themselves
a
great
deal
of
the
discomfort
we
suffered
from
the
winds
the
following
day
we
left
pozos
de
la
reina
and
pushed
forward
as
quickly
as
possible
as
we
had
no
meat
left
and
had
not
yet
arrived
in
the
country
of
the
guanacos
and
ostriches
the
indians
had
very
recently
passed
over
all
the
ground
we
were
now
crossing
and
as
usual
had
swept
away
any
game
there
might
have
been
there
the
range
where
guanaco
really
become
plentiful
is
about
eighty
miles
away
from
sandy
point
still
we
kept
a
good
and
any
ostrich
or
guanaco
that
might
have
had
the
misfortune
to
show
itself
would
have
stood
a
poor
chance
of
escape
with
some
eight
or
nine
hungry
dogs
and
a
number
of
not
less
keen
horsemen
at
its
heels
but
the
day
wore
on
and
we
arrived
at
our
destination
the
spot
we
camped
at
lay
directly
in
front
of
cape
gregorio
which
was
hazily
visible
in
the
distance
there
was
an
abundance
of
wood
in
the
locality
and
the
indian
camp
being
not
far
off
we
were
conveniently
situated
in
every
respect
as
we
intended
paying
these
interesting
people
a
visit
before
continuing

their
sakes
therefore
as
well
as
for
our
own
we
looked
forward
to
our
visit
to
the
indian
camp
apart
from
other
motives
of
interest
in
the
hopes
of
obtaining
a
sufficient
supply
of
meat
to
last
for
all
of
us
until
we
should
arrive
in
the
promised
land
of
game
after
breakfast
the
horses
were
saddled
and
taking
some
sugar
tobacco
and
other
articles
for
bartering
purposes
we
set
out
for
the
indian
camp
accompanied
by
gregorio
and
guillaume
and
storer
were
left
in
charge
of
our
camp
and
francisco
went
off
with
the
dogs
towards
cape
gregorio
in
the
hope
of
falling
in
with
some
stray
ostrich
or
guanaco
the
weather
was
fine
and
for
once
we
were
able
to
rejoice
in
the
absence
of
the
rough
winds
which
were
our
daily
annoyance
we
had
not
gone
far
when
we
saw
a
rider
coming
slowly
towards
us
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
found
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
a
real
patagonian
indian
we
reined
in
our
horses
when
he
got
close
to
us
to
have
a
good
look
at
him
and
he
doing
the
same
for
a
few
minutes
we
stared
at
him
to
our
hearts
content
receiving
in
return
as
minute
and
careful
a
scrutiny
from
him
whatever
he
may
have
thought
of
us
we
thought
him
a
singularly
unprepossessing
object
and
for
the
sake
of
his
race
we
hoped
an
unfavourable
specimen
of
it
his
dirty
brown
face
of
which
the
principal
feature
was
a
pair
of
sharp
black
eyes
was
by
tangled
masses
of
unkempt
hair
held
together
by
a
handkerchief
tied
over
his
forehead
and
his
burly
body
was
enveloped
in
a
greasy
considerably
the
worse
for
wear
his
feet
were
bare
but
one
of
his
heels
was
armed
with
a
little
wooden
spur
of
curious
and
ingenious
handiwork
having
completed
his
survey
of
our
persons
and
exchanged
a
few
guttural
grunts
with
gregorio
of
which
the
purport
was
that
he
had
lost
some
horses
and
was
on
their
search
he
galloped
away
and
glad
to
find
some
virtue
in
him
we
were
able
to
admire
the
easy
grace
with
which
he
sat
his
looking
little
horse
which
though
considerably
below
his
weight
was
doubtless
able
to
do
its
master
good
service
continuing
our
way
we
presently
observed
several
mounted
indians
sitting
motionless
on
their
horses
like
sentries
on
the
summit
of
a
tall
ridge
ahead
of
us
evidently
watching
our
movements
at
our
approach
they
disappeared
over
the
ridge
on
the
other
side
of
which
lay
their
cantering
forward
we
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
entire
indian
camp
which
was
pitched
in
a
broad
flanked
on
either
side
by
steep
bluffs
and
with
a
little
stream
flowing
down
its
centre
there
were
about
a
dozen
big
hide
tents
in
front
of
which
stood
crowds
of
men
and
women
watching
our
approach
with
lazy
curiosity
numbers
of
little
children
were
disporting
themselves
in
the
stream
which
we
had
to
ford
in
order
to
get
to
the
tents
two
indians
more
inquisitive
than
their
brethren
came
out
to
meet
us
both
mounted
on
the
same
horse
and
saluted
us
with
much
grinning
and
jabbering
on
our
arrival
in
the
camp
we
were
soon
encircled
by
a
curious
crowd
some
of
whose
number
gazed
at
us
with
stolid
gravity
whilst
others
laughed
and
gesticulated
as
they
discussed
our
appearance
in
their
harsh
guttural
language
with
a
vivacious
manner
which
was
quite
at
variance
with
the
received
traditions
of
the
solemn
bent
of
the
indian
mind
our
accoutrements
and
clothes
seemed
to
excite
great
interest
my
in
particular
being
objects
of
attentive
examination
and
apparently
of
much
serious
speculation
at
first
they
were
content
to
observe
them
from
a
distance
but
presently
a
little
boy
was
delegated
by
the
elders
to
advance
and
give
them
a
closer
inspection
this
he
proceeded
to
do
coming
towards
me
with
great
caution
and
when
near
enough
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
touched
the
boots
gently
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
this
exploit
was
greeted
with
roars
of
laughter
and
ejaculations
and
emboldened
by
its
success
many
now
ventured
to
follow
his
example
some
enterprising
spirits
extending
their
researches
to
the
texture
of
my
ulster
and
one
even
going
so
far
as
to
take
my
hand
in
his
whilst
subjecting
a
little
bracelet
i
wore
to
a
profound
and
exhaustive
scrutiny
illustration
indian
camp
whilst
they
were
thus
occupied
i
had
leisure
to
observe
their
general
appearance
i
was
not
struck
so
much
by
their
height
as
by
their
extraordinary
development
of
chest
and
muscle
as
regards
their
stature
i
do
not
think
the
average
height
of
the
men
exceeded
six
feet
and
as
my
husband
stands
six
feet
two
inches
i
had
a
favourable
opportunity
for
forming
an
accurate
estimate
one
or
two
there
were
certainly
who
towered
far
above
him
but
these
were
exceptions
the
women
were
mostly
of
the
ordinary
height
though
i
noticed
one
who
must
have
been
quite
six
feet
if
not
more
the
features
of
the
tehuelche
are
extremely
regular
and
by
no
means
unpleasant
to
look
at
the
nose
is
generally
aquiline
the
mouth
well
shaped
and
beautified
by
the
whitest
of
teeth
the
expression
of
the
eye
is
intelligent
and
the
form
of
the
whole
head
affords
a
favourable
index
to
their
mental
capabilities
these
remarks
do
not
apply
to
the
tehuelches
in
whose
veins
there
is
a
mixture
of
araucanian
or
fuegian
blood
the
flat
noses
oblique
eyes
and
badly
proportioned
figures
of
the
latter
make
them
most
repulsive
objects
and
they
are
as
different
from
a
tehuelche
in
every
respect
as
from
an
ordinary
carthorse
their
hair
is
long
and
coarse
and
is
worn
parted
in
the
middle
being
prevented
from
falling
over
their
faces
by
means
of
a
handkerchief
or
fillet
of
some
kind
tied
round
the
forehead
they
have
naturally
little
hair
on
the
face
and
such
growth
as
may
appear
is
carefully
eradicated
a
painful
operation
which
many
extend
even
to
their
eyebrows
their
dress
is
simple
and
consists
of
a
chiripá
a
piece
of
cloth
round
the
loins
and
the
indispensable
guanaco
capa
which
is
hung
loosely
over
the
shoulders
and
held
round
the
body
by
the
hand
though
it
would
obviously
seem
more
convenient
to
have
it
secured
round
the
waist
with
a
belt
of
some
kind
their
boots
are
only
worn
for
reasons
of
economy
when
hunting
the
women
dress
like
the
men
except
as
regards
the
chiripá
instead
of
which
they
wear
a
loose
kind
of
gown
beneath
the
capa
which
they
fasten
at
the
neck
with
a
silver
brooch
or
pin
the
children
are
allowed
to
run
about
naked
till
they
are
five
or
six
years
old
and
are
then
dressed
like
their
elders
partly
for
ornament
partly
also
as
a
means
of
protection
against
the
wind
a
great
many
indians
paint
their
faces
their
favourite
colour
as
far
as
i
could
see
being
red
though
one
or
two
i
observed
had
given
the
preference
to
a
mixture
of
that
colour
with
black
a
very
diabolical
appearance
being
the
result
of
this
combination
the
tehuelches
are
a
race
that
is
fast
approaching
extinction
and
even
at
present
it
scarcely
numbers
eight
hundred
souls
they
lead
a
rambling
nomadic
existence
shifting
their
camping
places
from
one
region
to
another
whenever
the
game
in
their
vicinity
gets
shy
or
scarce
it
is
fortunate
for
them
that
the
immense
numbers
of
guanaco
and
ostriches
makes
it
an
easy
matter
for
them
to
find
subsistence
as
they
are
extremely
lazy
and
plentiful
as
game
is
around
them
often
pass
two
or
three
days
without
food
rather
than
incur
the
very
slight
exertion
attendant
on
a
day
hunting
but
it
is
only
the
men
who
are
cursed
or
blessed
with
this
indolent
spirit
the
women
are
indefatigably
industrious
all
the
work
of
tehuelche
existence
is
done
by
them
except
hunting
when
not
employed
in
ordinary
household
work
they
busy
themselves
in
making
guanaco
capas
weaving
garters
and
fillets
for
the
hair
working
silver
ornaments
and
so
forth
not
one
of
their
least
arduous
tasks
is
that
of
collecting
firewood
which
always
a
scarce
article
becomes
doubly
hard
to
find
except
by
going
great
distances
when
they
camp
long
in
one
place
but
though
treated
thus
unfairly
as
regards
the
division
of
labour
the
women
can
by
no
means
complain
of
want
of
devotion
to
them
on
the
part
of
the
men
marriages
are
matters
of
great
solemnity
with
them
and
the
tie
is
strictly
kept
husband
and
wife
show
great
affection
for
one
another
and
both
agree
in
extravagant
love
of
their
offspring
which
they
pet
and
spoil
to
their
hearts
content
the
most
prominent
characteristic
of
the
tehuelche
is
his
good
humour
for
whereas
most
aboriginal
races
incline
to
silence
and
saturnine
gravity
he
is
all
smiles
and
chatter
the
other
good
qualities
of
the
race
are
fast
disappearing
under
the
influence
of
aquadiente
to
the
use
of
which
they
are
getting
more
and
more
addicted
and
soon
it
is
to
be
feared
they
will
become
nothing
more
than
a
pack
of
impoverished
dirty
thieving
ragamuffins
after
having
sat
for
some
time
on
horseback
in
the
centre
of
the
numerous
circle
above
referred
to
we
dismounted
the
act
causing
fresh
animation
and
merriment
in
our
interviewers
whose
interest
in
us
after
a
thorough
examination
had
begun
to
flag
somewhat
an
object
which
greatly
excited
their
feelings
was
a
rifle
belonging
to
my
brother
and
their
delight
knew
no
bounds
when
he
dismounted
and
fired
it
off
for
their
edification
once
or
twice
at
a
distant
mark
at
each
discharge
they
set
up
a
lusty
howl
of
satisfaction
and
nothing
would
do
for
them
but
for
each
to
be
allowed
to
handle
the
weapon
and
inspect
its
mechanism
there
was
a
trader
in
the
camp
who
had
arrived
about
the
same
time
as
we
did
and
amongst
other
wares
he
had
brought
a
rusty
carbine
with
him
for
sale
he
was
called
upon
by
the
indians
to
produce
it
and
fire
it
off
to
compare
its
qualities
with
those
of
my
brother
rifle
this
he
proceeded
to
do
but
seven
times
in
succession
the
cartridges
missed
fire
each
time
this
happened
he
was
greeted
with
shouts
of
derisive
laughter
and
it
was
evident
that
both
he
and
his
weapon
were
the
objects
of
most
disparaging
remarks
on
the
part
of
the
tehuelches
one
of
them
a
man
of
some
humour
brought
out
a
small
piece
of
ostrich
meat
and
offered
it
to
the
trader
in
exchange
for
his
carbine
saying
in
broken
spanish
your
gun
never
kill
piece
of
meat
as
big
as
this
your
gun
good
to
kill
dead
guanaco
at
which
witticism
there
was
renewed
and
prolonged
applause
as
the
newspapers
say
but
excitement
reached
its
height
when
i
produced
the
bag
of
sugar
we
had
brought
and
began
to
distribute
small
handfuls
of
its
contents
among
the
children
everybody
pressed
round
me
men
and
women
hustling
and
pushing
in
their
eagerness
to
get
some
of
the
coveted
dainty
i
was
obliged
to
be
careful
in
my
bounty
however
or
we
should
not
have
enough
left
to
obtain
any
meat
in
exchange
and
a
great
many
tehuelches
had
to
remain
disappointed
in
consequence
as
it
was
we
found
considerable
difficulty
in
obtaining
any
meat
the
indians
had
not
been
out
hunting
for
three
days
and
there
was
hardly
anything
but
pemmican
in
the
camp
a
greasy
concoction
with
which
we
by
no
means
cared
to
experiment
on
our
stomachs
with
difficulty
we
at
last
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
leg
and
breast
of
an
ostrich
and
a
small
piece
of
half
guanaco
meat
which
looked
extremely
untempting
this
transaction
having
been
accomplished
we
wandered
leisurely
about
the
camp
glancing
at
the
different
objects
of
interest
that
came
in
our
way
pestered
not
a
little
as
we
moved
along
by
swarms
of
yelping
curs
which
barked
and
snapped
viciously
at
us
and
could
only
be
kept
at
a
respectful
distance
by
a
free
use
of
stones
and
whips
at
one
of
the
tents
we
saw
two
remarkably
clean
and
pretty
girls
who
were
engaged
on
some
kind
of
sewing
work
and
beside
them
probably
making
love
to
one
or
both
stood
an
equally
youth
who
struck
me
by
the
peculiar
neatness
of
his
dress
and
his
general
à
quatre
appearance
his
hair
was
brushed
and
combed
and
carefully
parted
a
bright
red
silk
handkerchief
keeping
its
glossy
locks
in
due
subjection
his
handsome
guanaco
capa
was
new
and
brilliantly
painted
on
the
outside
and
being
half
opened
displayed
a
clean
white
chiripá
fastened
at
the
waist
by
a
silver
belt
of
curious
workmanship
a
pair
of
neatly
fitting
boots
encased
his
feet
reaching
up
to
the
knees
where
they
were
secured
by
a
pair
of
garters
possibly
the
gift
of
one
of
the
fair
maidens
at
his
side
struck
by
his
graceful
bearing
and
looking
face
i
begged
who
had
brought
a
with
him
to
make
a
sketch
of
this
handsome
son
of
the
pampa
during
the
process
the
young
indian
never
moved
and
preserved
a
perfectly
indifferent
demeanour
but
when
the
picture
was
finished
and
given
to
him
for
inspection
his
forehead
contracted
with
anger
an
expression
of
fear
came
in
his
eyes
he
gave
vent
to
some
angry
sounding
gutturals
and
finally
much
to
our
annoyance
tore
the
portrait
to
pieces
he
was
under
the
impression
that
the
object
of
making
the
sketch
was
to
throw
some
evil
spell
over
him
and
that
a
misfortune
would
happen
if
it
were
not
destroyed
being
relieved
of
this
danger
his
feelings
regained
their
natural
calm
and
he
grinned
contentedly
at
our
evident
wrath
at
his
proceeding
the
indians
were
about
to
make
their
annual
visit
to
sandy
point
where
they
go
to
obtain
the
rations
of
sugar
tobacco
allowed
to
them
by
the
chilian
government
and
to
barter
with
the
inhabitants
for
the
luxuries
of
civilisation
in
exchange
for
furs
and
ostrich
feathers
at
which
transactions
as
they
are
seldom
sober
during
their
stay
outside
the
colony
they
generally
get
worsted
by
the
cunning
white
man
our
curiosity
regarding
the
indians
being
satisfied
and
having
obtained
all
the
meat
we
could
from
them
we
now
turned
homewards
chapter
vii
the
prairie
fire
as
we
rode
along
our
attention
was
attracted
by
a
faint
smell
of
burning
and
presently
thick
clouds
of
smoke
came
rolling
towards
us
we
pressed
wonderingly
on
anxious
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
the
fire
which
we
trusted
lay
somewhere
far
from
our
camp
reaching
a
slight
eminence
we
were
able
to
command
a
view
of
the
country
ahead
a
cry
of
dismay
escaped
our
lips
as
we
looked
around
and
drawing
rein
we
stared
blankly
at
one
another
a
fearful
sight
lay
before
us
to
our
left
right
in
front
and
gradually
wreathing
the
hills
to
our
right
a
huge
prairie
fire
came
rushing
rapidly
along
dense
masses
of
smoke
curled
aloft
and
entirely
obscured
the
sky
the
flames
which
shot
fiercely
up
cast
a
strange
yellow
glare
over
everything
even
whilst
we
watched
a
strong
gust
of
wind
swept
the
fire
with
incredible
swiftness
towards
us
and
in
a
second
we
were
enveloped
in
such
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
that
we
were
unable
to
see
one
another
the
situation
had
now
become
critical
and
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
half
choked
and
bewildered
by
the
suddenness
with
which
the
danger
had
come
upon
us
we
scarcely
knew
what
course
to
take
already
our
horses
were
snorting
with
fear
as
the
crackling
of
the
burning
grass
and
bushes
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
run
away
from
the
coming
fire
was
useless
the
alternative
was
to
face
it
at
a
gallop
and
get
through
it
if
possible
to
throw
our
guanaco
mantles
over
our
heads
and
draw
them
as
tightly
round
us
as
we
could
was
the
work
of
a
second
and
then
digging
our
spurs
into
our
horses
we
dashed
forward
every
one
for
himself
the
moments
that
followed
seemed
an
eternity
as
i
urged
my
unwilling
horse
forward
the
sense
of
suffocation
grew
terrible
i
could
scarcely
draw
breath
and
the
panting
animal
seemed
to
stagger
beneath
me
the
horrible
crackling
came
nearer
and
nearer
i
became
conscious
of
the
most
intolerable
heat
and
my
head
began
to
swim
round
my
horse
gave
two
or
three
furious
plunges
and
then
burst
madly
forward
almost
choked
come
what
might
i
could
bear
the
mantle
over
my
head
no
longer
and
tore
it
off
me
the
sudden
sense
of
relief
that
came
over
me
as
i
did
so
i
shall
never
forget
i
looked
up
the
air
was
comparatively
clear
and
the
fire
me
by
some
miracle
i
had
passed
through
it
unhurt
i
looked
for
my
companions
and
to
my
inexpressible
joy
saw
them
emerge
one
by
one
from
the
black
mass
of
smoke
which
was
now
rapidly
receding
into
the
distance
congratulations
and
exclamations
over
we
retraced
our
steps
to
try
and
discover
how
we
had
managed
to
escape
so
luckily
the
reason
was
soon
apparent
by
a
piece
of
fortune
we
had
happened
to
ride
over
a
narrow
pebbly
tract
of
ground
where
the
grass
was
extremely
sparse
and
where
there
were
but
few
bushes
had
chance
led
us
over
any
other
track
where
the
grass
was
thick
and
tall
we
could
scarcely
ever
have
got
through
the
danger
our
poor
horses
had
suffered
a
good
deal
as
it
was
their
feet
and
legs
being
scorched
and
singed
severely
our
thoughts
now
flew
to
our
camp
and
to
storer
and
whom
we
had
left
behind
there
that
they
had
escaped
we
had
little
doubt
but
for
our
tents
and
chattels
we
felt
there
was
no
hope
the
landscape
seemed
completely
changed
by
the
fire
all
around
as
far
as
we
could
see
stretched
black
smoking
plains
and
the
outlines
of
the
hills
had
become
quite
unfamiliar
to
us
with
rather
heavy
hearts
we
pushed
forward
eagerly
scanning
the
country
for
some
indication
which
might
guide
us
to
the
quarter
where
our
camp
had
stood
if
as
we
had
every
reason
to
believe
our
things
were
burnt
our
patagonian
trip
was
at
an
end
for
the
present
at
all
events
fortunately
things
did
not
turn
out
so
badly
presently
my
husband
who
was
riding
in
advance
of
the
others
gave
a
shout
and
made
signals
for
us
to
come
on
i
need
hardly
say
that
we
did
not
lose
a
moment
in
joining
him
and
a
welcome
sight
as
we
got
up
to
him
met
our
eyes
some
two
or
three
hundred
yards
below
the
hill
on
which
we
were
we
perceived
our
little
white
tents
standing
safe
and
unharmed
on
a
narrow
green
tract
of
land
which
looked
like
a
smiling
island
in
the
midst
of
the
vast
black
plain
storer
and
too
we
could
see
moving
about
and
overjoyed
we
galloped
down
towards
them
they
running
out
to
meet
us
having
suffered
no
little
anxiety
on
their
parts
as
to
what
might
have
happened
to
us
we
pressed
question
after
question
to
and
storer
as
to
how
they
had
managed
to
save
the
camp
storer
was
unable
to
give
any
intelligible
account
so
entirely
upset
was
he
by
fright
but
natural
philosophical
calm
had
not
deserted
him
even
on
this
occasion
and
from
him
we
heard
all
particulars
the
fire
he
informed
us
had
been
caused
by
the
indian
we
had
met
in
the
morning
on
the
for
strayed
horses
this
man
had
amused
himself
by
setting
fire
to
the
long
dry
grass
in
various
places
and
fanned
by
a
strong
wind
the
flames
spread
and
soon
assumed
enormous
proportions
quick
to
perceive
the
possible
danger
our
camp
was
in
the
indian
at
once
galloped
up
and
with
the
assistance
of
and
storer
set
about
making
a
or
counter
fire
that
is
to
say
they
gradually
set
fire
to
the
grass
all
round
the
camp
letting
it
burn
a
considerable
tract
but
always
keeping
it
well
in
subjection
beating
it
out
with
bushes
and
trampling
it
under
foot
so
that
it
could
not
get
beyond
their
control
this
precautionary
measure
was
fortunately
completed
by
the
time
the
big
fire
came
on
and
although
for
a
minute
or
two
they
were
half
suffocated
by
the
smoke
the
fire
passed
harmlessly
by
the
camp
itself
the
burnt
belt
around
it
proving
an
effectual
safeguard
our
horses
were
all
safe
as
they
had
been
grazing
on
the
far
side
of
a
stream
in
an
adjacent
valley
the
camp
was
in
great
disorder
the
tents
were
blackened
by
the
smoke
the
and
other
chattels
lay
scattered
in
confusion
our
furs
and
rugs
had
been
used
to
cover
the
cartridges
with
for
whilst
the
fire
raged
around
it
the
camp
was
deluged
with
showers
of
sparks
and
an
explosion
might
easily
have
occurred
had
this
precaution
not
been
taken
for
some
time
we
were
busy
putting
things
straight
and
in
the
meanwhile
françois
arrived
from
his
hunting
excursion
it
had
proved
unsuccessful
and
as
we
had
obtained
but
very
little
meat
from
the
indians
for
the
sake
of
our
dogs
who
had
been
on
very
short
rations
for
some
time
it
became
a
matter
of
great
urgency
that
we
should
get
as
soon
as
possible
into
regions
where
guanaco
and
ostrich
were
plentiful
and
accordingly
we
decided
to
start
on
the
following
day
dinner
over
my
companions
were
not
long
before
they
went
to
sleep
but
feeling
little
inclination
to
follow
their
example
i
strolled
out
and
wandered
round
the
camp
watching
with
interest
the
strange
changes
that
came
over
the
landscape
as
day
waned
and
night
came
slowly
on
the
black
hills
behind
the
camp
loomed
like
shadowy
phantoms
against
the
sky
far
and
wide
slept
the
silent
pampa
its
undulating
surface
illumined
by
the
rays
of
a
lovely
moon
the
faint
glow
which
tinged
the
horizon
and
the
strange
noises
which
a
puff
of
wind
occasionally
brought
to
my
ears
showed
that
the
mighty
fire
was
still
burning
in
the
distance
with
unbated
fury
perhaps
not
to
stop
in
its
devastating
course
till
it
reached
the
for
a
long
time
i
stood
immersed
in
the
contemplation
of
this
weird
desolate
scene
giving
myself
up
to
the
mysterious
feelings
and
the
many
vague
and
fanciful
thoughts
it
suggested
till
overcome
with
the
excitement
and
exertions
of
the
day
i
had
at
last
to
give
way
to
drowsiness
and
seek
my
couch

the

home
hungry
as
hunters
the
next
morning
we
were
up
betimes
as
we
were
going
to
continue
our
journey
whilst
we
were
engaged
in
the
tedious
operation
of
packing
up
an
indian
woman
walked
suddenly
into
the
ring
of
bushes
which
surrounded
our
encampment
and
seated
herself
silently
by
the
fire
gregorio
elicited
from
her
that
on
the
previous
night
the
indians
had
been
drinking
heavily
and
that
she
had
had
a
quarrel
with
her
husband
whilst
both
were
inebriated
in
consequence
of
which
she
had
left
his
tent
and
was
now
on
her
way
to
sandy
point
she
had
walked
the
whole
distance
from
the
indian
camp
barefoot
but
did
not
seem
in
the
least
tired
i
suppose
she
counted
on
her
husband
regretting
his
behaviour
and
coming
after
her
to
fetch
her
back
for
she
could
hardly
have
seriously
entertained
the
idea
of
walking
all
the
way
to
sandy
point
i
offered
her
some
biscuits
and
a
stick
of
chocolate
which
she
accepted
readily
enough
but
without
even
so
much
as
a
grunt
by
way
of
thanks
presently
she
told
gregorio
that
the
indians
were
breaking
up
their
camp
and
that
some
were
going
to
march
on
to
sandy
point
this
piece
of
information
made
us
hurry
on
with
our
work
as
we
dreaded
being
surprised
by
a
party
of
indians
with
all
our
effects
scattered
about
offering
tempting
facilities
for
abstraction
which
the
tehuelche
heart
was
sure
not
to
be
able
to
resist
to
such
a
visit
we
were
moreover
extremely
liable
as
our
camp
was
unfortunately
close
to
the
trail
to
sandy
point
our
fears
were
realised
only
too
soon
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
arrival
of
the
squaw
two
indians
came
crashing
unceremoniously
through
the
bushes
and
wheeling
their
horses
about
the
camp
careless
of
our
crockery
after
a
short
examination
they
dismounted
and
coolly
sat
down
by
our
fire
answering
our
angry
looks
with
imperturbed
stares
of
stolid
indifference
five
minutes
later
another
party
arrived
followed
shortly
by
a
further
batch
and
presently
we
were
quite
inundated
by
a
swarm
of
these
unbidden
guests
of
course
our
work
was
stopped
all
our
attention
being
required
to
look
after
our
goods
and
chattels
over
these
we
kept
guard
in
no
very
good
humour
breathing
fervent
prayers
the
while
for
speedy
relief
from
our
friends
who
on
their
part
evinced
no
particular
hurry
to
go
away
they
had
made
themselves
comfortable
at
our
fire
and
were
passing
round
the
social
pipe
in
evident
good
humour
with
themselves
and
their
present
quarters
to
complete
the
irony
of
the
situation
one
of
their
number
who
could
speak
spanish
came
and
asked
me
for
a
little
coffee
which
he
purposed
to
cook
in
our
kettle
which
was
still
simmering
conveniently
on
the
fire
as
may
be
imagined
he
met
with
an
indignant
refusal
however
it
only
appeared
to
amuse
him
and
his
friends
and
by
no
means
influenced
them
in
hastening
their
departure
meanwhile
time
went
on
and
some
expedient
for
getting
rid
of
them
had
to
be
devised
unless
we
wished
to
lose
a
whole
day
it
occurred
to
us
that
they
might
possibly
be
bribed
to
go
away
by
means
of
a
small
offering
of
whisky
and
through
gregorio
we
accordingly
intimated
to
them
that
if
they
would
leave
us
they
should
be
rewarded
for
their
kindness
with
a
glass
of
that
spirit
to
our
relief
they
accepted
this
offer
and
we
presently
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
them
ride
leisurely
away
to
do
them
justice
i
must
say
that
contrary
to
our
fears
they
did
not
steal
any
of
our
effects
though
possibly
the
strict
watch
we
kept
over
them
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
this
unusual
display
of
honesty
the
moment
they
had
gone
we
redoubled
our
efforts
and
succeeded
in
getting
all
our
horses
saddled
and
packed
without
further
molestation
the
three
mules
still
remained
to
be
packed
but
these
we
left
to
the
care
of
gregorio
and
guillaume
who
were
to
follow
us
we
meanwhile
starting
off
under
the
guidance
of
old
francisco
went
off
alone
by
another
route
in
order
to
forage
for
meat
be
it
ostrich
or
guanaco
of
which
both
ourselves
and
the
dogs
stood
very
much
in
need
the
small
supply
we
had
got
from
the
indians
being
quite
exhausted
just
as
we
were
leaving
an
indian
galloped
up
who
turned
out
to
be
the
husband
of
the
pedestrian
squaw
who
after
the
departure
of
the
other
indians
still
remained
in
our
camp
the
reconciliation
scene
was
a
very
short
one
and
did
not
go
beyond
a
few
inexpressive
grunts
on
either
side
after
which
the
squaw
got
up
on
horseback
behind
her
husband
and
off
they
rode
towards
sandy
point
we
now
struck
northwards
leaving
cape
gregorio
which
lay
directly
opposite
our
late
encampment
at
our
backs
having
to
keep
the
troop
together
singlehanded
we
had
plenty
to
do
to
help
him
and
in
galloping
after
refractory
horses
urging
on
the
lazy
ones
and
occasionally
stopping
to
adjust
packs
the
time
passed
quickly
enough
we
occasionally
crossed
tracts
of
land
covered
with
a
plant
bearing
a
profusion
of
red
berries
of
the
cranberry
species
they
were
quite
ripe
now
and
we
found
them
pleasant
and
refreshing
the
weather
was
as
usual
sunny
and
bracing
and
except
that
as
yet
we
had
not
seen
a
guanaco
or
given
chase
to
a
single
ostrich
we
had
nothing
to
grumble
about
told
us
that
we
were
certain
to
meet
with
guanaco
on
that
day
march
so
with
this
assurance
we
comforted
ourselves
and
kept
a
sharp
eagerly
scanning
the
horizon
of
each
successive
plain
and
woe
betide
the
unfortunate
animal
that
might
appear
within
our
ken
the
day
passed
however
and
a
dark
patch
of
beeches
which
stood
near
the
spot
where
we
were
to
camp
that
night
appeared
in
view
without
our
having
seen
either
an
ostrich
or
a
guanaco
somebody
found
an
ostrich
egg
though
and
it
was
carefully
kept
against
for
although
it
must
have
been
laid
two
or
perhaps
three
months
there
was
still
a
possibility
of
its
being
tolerably
good
as
these
eggs
occasionally
keep
till
the
month
of
april
six
months
after
laying
time
towards
sunset
we
arrived
at
a
broad
valley
scattered
over
with
picturesque
clumps
of
beeches
and
bordered
on
its
far
side
by
a
thick
wood
of
the
same
tree
pointed
out
a
spot
to
us
where
he
said
there
were
some
springs
by
the
side
of
which
we
were
to
camp
and
thither
we
accordingly
rode
but
when
we
got
there
no
springs
were
to
be
seen
and
said
he
must
have
mistaken
the
place
he
suddenly
remembered
however
that
a
conspicuous
clump
of
beeches
some
way
up
the
valley
marked
the
right
spot
so
we
turned
in
that
direction
but
again
was
mistaken
and
when
following
various
of
his
sudden
inspirations
we
had
wandered
about
the
valley
in
all
directions
for
a
considerable
time
without
coming
across
these
problematic
springs
we
began
to
think
ourselves
justified
in
presuming
that
had
lost
his
way
and
in
charging
him
with
the
same
he
denied
the
accusation
however
with
a
calm
and
steady
assurance
which
considering
that
all
the
time
he
was
leading
us
about
in
aimless
helplessness
would
have
had
something
rather
humorous
about
it
had
our
situation
been
a
less
serious
one
if
we
did
not
succeed
in
finding
the
springs
besides
having
to
endure
the
torture
of
thirst
ourselves
we
should
have
to
stop
up
all
night
to
look
after
the
horses
who
would
be
certain
to
go
off
in
search
of
water
and
get
lost
it
was
rapidly
getting
dark
too
and
there
were
no
signs
of
the
arrival
of
any
of
the
other
guides
whose
absence
was
a
further
confirmation
that
we
could
not
be
on
the
right
track
as
a
last
resource
we
resolved
to
separate
and
each
go
in
a
different
direction
in
search
of
water
though
i
must
say
we
had
little
hopes
of
success
it
being
known
to
us
that
beyond
the
springs
in
question
there
was
no
other
water
in
that
part
of
the
country
for
a
considerable
distance
hurling
bitter
but
useless
anathemas
at
who
was
now
confidently
pointing
out
a
new
spot
as
the
really
right
one
we
accordingly
broke
up
and
having
arranged
to
fire
a
shot
as
a
signal
should
any
one
of
us
find
water
dispersed
over
the
valley
in
all
directions
i
had
hardly
skirted
the
beechwood
for
more
than
a
minute
or
so
when
my
horse
suddenly
neighed
joyfully
and
in
an
opening
among
the
trees
i
saw
two
or
three
small
pools
of
spring
water
overjoyed
i
lost
no
time
in
firing
off
my
gun
the
report
of
which
soon
brought
up
all
the
others
who
had
not
gone
far
in
justice
to
it
must
be
said
that
for
the
last
hour
he
had
been
wandering
about
close
to
where
the
springs
lay
and
his
persistent
denial
of
having
lost
his
way
was
so
far
justified
besides
as
there
was
no
trail
of
any
description
across
the
pampa
over
which
we
had
that
day
ridden
it
was
really
no
easy
matter
to
hit
on
the
right
spot
immediately
we
had
just
set
up
the
tents
and
made
the
fire
when
gregorio
and
guillaume
at
whose
prolonged
absence
now
that
we
were
at
the
springs
ourselves
we
had
become
rather
uneasy
appeared
with
the
mules
they
had
been
delayed
on
the
road
by
the
packs
getting
undone
francisco
too
soon
came
up
and
though
he
had
been
unsuccessful
in
the
chase
he
arrived
in
time
to
cook
an
excellent
omelette
for
our
dinners
with
the
ostrich
egg
which
turned
out
to
be
perfectly
sound
and
palatable
the
next
day
was
to
be
devoted
to
the
want
of
meat
having
become
quite
a
serious
matter
our
dogs
were
getting
weak
and
our
stores
on
which
we
had
to
rely
solely
for
food
were
disappearing
in
an
alarmingly
quick
manner
it
is
marvellous
how
the
ordinary
excitement
of
hunting
is
increased
when
as
in
our
case
one
dinner
depends
on
one
success
and
it
was
with
feelings
almost
of
solemnity
that
early
in
the
morning
we
selected
and
saddled
our
best
horses
sharpened
our
slung
our
rifles
and
followed
by
the
dogs
who
knew
perfectly
well
that
real
earnest
sport
was
meant
threaded
the
beechwood
and
rode
up
on
to
the
plateau
where
according
to
the
unanimous
assurance
of
the
guides
we
could
not
fail
to
meet
with
guanaco
and
storer
having
been
left
behind
to
look
after
the
camp
our
numbered
seven
in
order
to
cover
as
much
ground
as
possible
we
spread
out
in
a
line
extending
over
about
two
miles
and
in
this
order
we
cantered
northward
from
the
valley
carefully
scanning
the
plain
which
stretched
flat
away
for
a
good
distance
but
apparently
as
bare
of
guanaco
as
it
was
of
grass
the
weather
unlike
that
of
the
preceding
day
was
very
cold
and
a
bitterly
sharp
wind
blew
right
into
our
faces
making
those
of
our
number
who
had
neglected
to
bring
their
greatcoats
or
furs
very
uncomfortable
this
however
was
a
trifling
matter
if
only
those
good
guanacos
would
obligingly
make
their
appearance
but
evidently
nothing
was
farther
from
their
minds
and
we
rode
over
the
plain
mile
after
mile
with
hopes
which
like
the
thermometer
were
gradually
sinking
towards
zero
as
time
went
on
the
haze
which
bound
the
plateau
at
our
approach
solidified
itself
into
an
escarpment
in
due
time
this
was
reached
and
i
rode
up
it
expecting
to
find
another
plain
on
its
summit
as
usual
instead
however
a
broken
hilly
country
appeared
in
view
crossed
in
all
directions
by
ravines
i
looked
eagerly
about
but
still
no
guanaco
our
line
of
advance
meantime
lost
its
order
owing
to
the
changed
nature
of
the
ground
and
frequently
i
lost
sight
of
all
my
companions
as
i
descended
into
a
ravine
or
rode
round
the
base
of
some
tall
hillock
but
it
was
never
long
before
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
one
or
other
of
them
again
the
wind
got
colder
and
colder
a
white
cloud
crept
up
on
the
horizon
and
grew
and
grew
sweeping
swiftly
towards
me
till
i
suddenly
found
myself
enveloped
in
a
furious
i
came
to
a
and
covered
up
my
head
to
protect
myself
from
the
hailstones
which
were
very
large
the
squall
did
not
last
long
but
when
i
looked
up
again
i
found
the
whole
country
was
whitened
over
an
atmospheric
freak
having
created
a
dreary
winter
landscape
in
the
middle
of
summer
suddenly
i
started
close
to
me
stood
perfectly
motionless
and
staring
me
full
in
the
face
a
tall
guanaco
i
was
so
startled
and
surprised
that
for
the
space
of
a
minute
i
sat
quietly
returning
his
stare
a
movement
of
my
horse
broke
the
spell
the
guanaco
darted
up
the
side
of
a
hill
like
lightning
and
pausing
a
moment
on
its
summit
disappeared
i
meanwhile
had
unslung
my
rifle
and
was
off
in
pursuit
of
him
instead
of
climbing
the
hill
i
rode
quickly
round
its
base
and
on
the
other
side
as
i
had
expected
i
discovered
my
friend
looking
upward
no
doubt
thinking
i
should
appear
by
the
same
road
he
had
come
i
had
the
selfishness
though
i
am
sure
sportsmen
will
excuse
it
to
wish
to
kill
the
first
guanaco
myself
and
i
was
therefore
by
no
means
displeased
to
find
that
my
companions
had
not
as
yet
perceived
us
with
a
beating
heart
i
dismounted
and
walked
slowly
towards
the
guanaco
who
though
he
saw
me
coming
still
remained
quietly
standing
my
weapon
was
a
light
but
though
an
excellent
arm
it
did
not
carry
more
than
yards
with
precision
and
i
was
now
something
over
yards
from
my
prey
he
allowed
me
to
advance
till
within
the
required
distance
but
then
to
my
disgust
just
as
i
was
preparing
to
fire
leisurely
walked
on
another
thirty
or
forty
yards
before
he
stopped
again
watching
me
the
while
as
it
seemed
with
an
amused
look
of
impertinence
which
aggravated
me
considerably
i
slowly
followed
him
vowing
to
fire
the
moment
i
was
within
range
whether
he
moved
or
not
this
time
i
was
more
successful
the
guanaco
allowed
me
to
come
within
about
the
necessary
yards
poor
fellow
i
murmured
generously
as
i
brought
my
rifle
up
to
my
shoulder
and
took
aim
just
behind
his
only
one
step
forward
to
make
quite
certain
alas
i
took
it
and
down
i
went
into
a
hole
which
in
my
eagerness
i
had
not
noticed
falling
rather
heavily
on
my
face
in
a
second
i
was
up
again
just
in
time
to
see
the
guanaco
bounding
up
a
far
escarpment
taking
with
him
my
chance
of
becoming
the
heroine
of
the
day
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
walk
back
to
where
i
had
left
my
horse
and
see
what
had
become
of
my
companions
i
took
the
same
road
the
guanaco
had
taken
on
the
remote
possibility
of
falling
in
with
him
again
riding
up
the
escarpment
above
referred
to
i
came
on
to
a
broad
plain
and
there
an
exciting
chase
was
going
on
in
which
as
it
appeared
i
was
condemned
to
take
the
part
of
a
spectator
only
at
some
distance
and
going
across
my
line
of
sight
was
a
guanaco
running
at
full
speed
closely
followed
by
a
pack
of
dogs
in
whose
track
but
some
way
behind
galloped
three
horsemen
whom
i
made
out
to
be
my
husband
and
brother
and
gregorio
the
guanaco
at
first
seemed
to
be
losing
ground
but
it
was
only
for
an
instant
in
another
he
bounded
away
with
ease
and
it
was
apparent
that
as
yet
he
was
only
playing
with
his
pursuers
the
pace
soon
began
to
tell
on
the
dogs
the
less
speedy
were
already
beginning
to
tail
off
one
of
them
probably
gregorio
swift
being
far
in
advance
of
its
comrades
and
by
no
means
to
be
shaken
off
by
the
guanaco
who
had
now
given
up
any
playful
demonstrations
of
superiority
and
had
settled
down
to
run
in
good
earnest
on
on
they
go
quarry
dogs
horsemen
will
soon
be
out
of
sight
but
what
this
the
guanaco
has
stopped
only
for
a
moment
though
but
he
has
swerved
to
the
left
and
behind
him
a
new
dog
and
horseman
have
appeared
on
the
scene
emerging
as
if
by
magic
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
the
chase
is
now
better
under
my
view
if
some
lucky
chance
would
only
bring
the
guanaco
my
way
the
fresh
dog
is
evidently
discomforting
him
and
his
having
had
to
swerve
has
brought
all
the
other
dogs
a
good
bit
nearer
to
his
heels
but
on
he
goes
running
bravely
and
making
for
the
escarpment
for
in
the
hilly
country
below
he
knows
he
is
at
an
advantage
the
dogs
seem
to
be
aware
of
this
too
for
they
redouble
their
efforts
a
splendid
race
ensuing
suddenly
another
horseman
appears
on
the
plateau
and
the
unfortunate
guanaco
must
again
swerve
to
the
left
a
movement
which
hurrah
brings
him
almost
facing
towards
where
i
am
standing
that
is
to
say
he
must
cross
the
escarpment
at
some
point
on
a
line
between
myself
and
the
the
other
horsemen
from
the
manner
the
race
had
been
run
forming
a
circle
in
his
rear
which
debarred
his
escape
in
any
other
direction
seeing
this
wild
with
excitement
i
dug
my
spurs
into
my
horse
and
flew
along
the
edge
of
the
escarpment
the
horseman
on
the
other
side
doing
the
same
in
order
to
shut
out
the
guanaco
and
throw
him
back
on
his
foes
behind
seeing
his
last
chance
about
to
be
cut
off
he
redoubled
his
efforts
to
get
through
between
us
on
on
we
strain
nearer
and
nearer
he
gets
to
the
edge
of
the
plain
and
already
with
despair
i
see
that
i
shall
be
too
late
but
faster
even
than
the
swift
guanaco
a
gallant
blackhound
has
crept
up
and
in
another
instant
though
the
former
dashes
past
me
within
a
yard
of
my
horse
nose
and
disappears
over
the
side
of
the
escarpment
the
good
dog
has
already
made
its
spring
and
clinging
like
grim
death
to
the
guanaco
haunch
vanishes
with
him
after
them
in
another
instant
swept
the
whole
quarry
of
dogs
and
by
the
time
i
reined
in
and
got
my
horse
down
the
steep
they
had
thrown
the
guanaco
which
had
brought
to
a
standstill
below
and
francisco
the
horseman
who
had
last
appeared
on
the
plateau
and
at
so
opportune
a
moment
had
already
given
the
with
his
knife
one
after
another
the
other
hunters
gradually
arrived
their
horses
more
or
less
blown
and
whilst
pipes
were
lit
and
flasks
produced
we
had
leisure
to
examine
this
our
first
guanaco
looking
at
his
frame
his
long
powerful
legs
his
deep
chest
and
body
as
almost
as
a
greyhound
we
no
longer
wondered
that
guanacos
run
as
swiftly
as
they
do
indeed
this
one
would
have
laughed
at
us
had
he
not
been
closed
in
as
he
was
the
fur
of
the
guanaco
is
of
a
woolly
texture
and
in
colour
of
a
reddish
brown
on
the
back
the
neck
and
the
quarters
being
whitish
on
the
belly
and
the
inner
sides
of
the
legs
the
head
closely
resembles
that
of
a
camel
the
eyes
which
have
a
strange
look
on
account
of
the
peculiar
shape
of
the
eye
bones
are
very
large
and
beautiful
a
guanaco
weighs
from
to
pounds
meantime
gregorio
having
begun
to
cut
up
the
guanaco
to
our
chagrin
it
was
discovered
to
be
mangy
a
disease
very
common
among
these
animals
probably
on
account
of
the
brackishness
of
the
water
and
the
meat
being
consequently
unfit
for
food
we
abandoned
it
to
the
dogs
who
now
made
the
first
good
meal
they
had
had
since
we
left
sandy
point
they
were
soon
gorged
to
such
an
extent
that
they
became
useless
for
hunting
purposes
and
we
had
therefore
to
ride
on
now
relying
solely
on
our
rifles
gregorio
had
seen
a
herd
of
guanacos
at
the
far
end
of
the
plain
over
which
the
chase
had
taken
place
and
thither
we
accordingly
rode
after
half
an
hour
galloping
we
reached
its
limit
finding
below
a
broad
valley
broken
up
into
various
depressions
and
hillocks
at
the
base
of
one
of
the
latter
we
saw
a
small
herd
of
guanaco
within
range
of
which
by
dint
of
careful
stalking
we
presently
managed
to
come
two
fortunate
shots
brought
a
couple
of
their
number
down
and
luckily
both
turned
out
to
be
quite
healthy
under
the
skilful
manipulation
of
gregorio
and
francisco
in
a
marvellously
short
space
of
time
they
were
cut
up
and
the
meat
having
been
distributed
among
our
various
saddles
heavily
laden
we
turned
homewards
illustration
guanacos
the
way
back
seemed
terribly
long
now
that
we
had
no
longer
the
excitement
of
hunting
to
shorten
the
time
and
it
seemed
quite
incredible
that
we
had
gone
the
distance
we
had
been
when
towards
sunset
after
a
cold
and
weary
ride
we
at
last
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
plain
which
overlooked
the
valley
where
lay
our
home
for
the
nonce
the
evening
had
turned
out
fine
the
boisterous
wind
which
had
annoyed
us
so
much
in
the
daytime
had
died
away
and
the
sky
was
now
bright
and
clear
through
the
branches
of
the
beech
trees
i
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
our
camp
with
its
white
tents
just
peeping
over
the
green
bushes
and
a
thin
column
of
blue
smoke
rising
up
into
the
air
pleasantly
suggestive
of
warm
tea
and
other
comforts
awaiting
us
farther
on
in
the
long
green
grass
of
the
valley
which
was
now
glowing
under
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
were
our
horses
some
grazing
others
lying
stretched
out
lazily
enjoying
their
day
respite
from
work
whilst
the
colts
and
fillies
as
is
their
wont
at
sundown
were
frisking
about
and
kicking
up
their
heels
in
all
the
exuberance
of
youth
unconscious
as
yet
of
heavy
packs
and
sharp
spurs
whatever
special
character
the
peaceful
scene
might
otherwise
want
was
fully
supplied
by
the
picturesquely
wild
appearance
of
my
companions
as
eschewing
contemplation
and
anticipating
dinner
they
rode
quickly
ahead
towards
the
camp
on
their
shaggy
sturdy
horses
their
bodies
muffled
in
the
graceful
guanaco
robe
and
huge
pieces
of
red
raw
meat
dangling
on
either
side
of
their
saddles
followed
by
the
hounds
who
seemed
thoroughly
tired
after
their
hard
day
work
but
whatever
country
one
is
in
whatever
scenes
one
may
be
among
in
one
own
cosy
snuggery
in
england
or
in
the
bleak
steppes
of
patagonia
there
is
a
peculiar
sameness
in
the
feeling
that
comes
over
one
towards
the
hours
of
evening
and
which
inevitably
calls
up
the
thought
it
must
be
getting
near
yielding
to
this
admonition
which
was
by
no
means
less
plain
than
usual
i
quitted
my
eyrie
and
rode
down
to
the
camp
when
i
got
there
i
found
preparations
for
an
ample
meal
in
full
swing
ingeniously
spitted
on
a
wooden
stave
the
whole
side
of
a
guanaco
was
roasting
before
a
blazing
fire
and
in
the
pot
a
head
of
the
same
animal
was
yielding
its
substance
towards
the
production
of
what
i
was
assured
would
turn
out
an
excellent
soup
at
i
was
able
practically
to
confirm
this
assurance
a
better
broth
can
not
be
concocted
than
that
obtained
from
such
a
guanaco
head
with
the
addition
of
rice
dried
vegetables
chilis
etc
but
at
the
risk
of
incurring
the
charge
of
digressing
too
much
on
the
subject
of
eating
i
must
pay
a
tribute
to
the
delicacy
of
a
peculiar
morsel
in
the
guanaco
which
we
called
and
which
is
in
fact
a
piece
of
fat
situated
as
indicated
by
its
name
the
tongue
and
the
brain
are
rare
but
they
must
yield
in
subtle
savouriness
to
the
aforesaid
having
once
tasted
it
till
the
end
of
our
trip
guanaco
head
formed
a
standing
item
in
our
daily
messes
and
whatever
other
culinary
novelties
we
discussed
and
they
were
as
numerous
as
strange
always
retained
its
supremacy
in
our
affections
as
the
plus
of
pampa
delicacies

we
should
like
to
have
lingered
on
in
the
beechwood

but
the
necessity
of
pushing
forward
as
quickly
as
possible
was
too
urgent
to
allow
of
our
indulging
in
our
lazy
desires

daybreak
saw
our
party
once
more
in

the
country
over
which
we
rode
this

was
more
rugged

hilly
than

down
upon
us
in

the

hot

affected
our

painfully
as
we

along

far
have
we
still
to

a

which
was
often
on
our
lips
though
from
experience
we
might
have
known
that

got

we

we
had
found
that
their
ideas
of
a
league
were
most
elastic
appearing
to
vary
daily
and
to
an
extent
which
made
it
impossible
for
us
to
form
any
mean
average
even
to
guide
us
to
an
approximate
estimation
of
the
value
of
their
assertions
thus
a
league
might
mean
ten
miles
and
possibly
only
one
at
length
as
the
sun
was
beginning
to
sink
a
shout
from
one
of
the
guides
made
us
glance
wearily
up
we
found
ourselves
on
the
brow
of
an
escarpment
at
the
foot
of
which
extended
a
plain
in
the
midst
of
which
shimmering
like
a
sheet
of
silver
lay
a
broad
lake
called
laguna
blanca
or
the
white
lake
this
welcome
sight
at
once
revived
our
drooping
spirits
and
for
the
next
hour
we
rode
merrily
forward
following
gregorio
who
was
seeking
for
a
little
ravine
where
there
was
a
small
freshwater
stream
which
flowed
down
towards
the
lake
we
soon
came
upon
it
and
lost
no
time
in
jumping
out
of
the
saddle
and
setting
to
work
with
a
will
at
the
erection
of
our
tents
and
the
preparation
of
our
evening
meal
the
latter
having
been
discussed
we
went
to
bed
the
sun
was
rather
high
in
the
heavens
when
i
opened
my
eyes
the
next
morning
and
pulling
aside
the
flap
of
the
tent
looked
out
upon
the
scene
all
our
camp
was
still
wrapt
in
sleep
save
who
was
sitting
over
the
fire
smoking
his
pipe
whilst
he
watched
the
kettle
boiling
in
placid
expectation
of
his
morning
coffee
the
plains
below
were
silent
but
the
air
was
noisy
with
the
cries
of
the
flocks
of
geese
and
who
were
winging
their
flight
from
the
lake
towards
the
rich
fields
of
cranberries
farther
inland
the
sharp
quack
of
the
ibis
would
occasionally
startle
me
as
a
bevy
of
these
birds
passed
seemingly
just
over
my
head
but
in
reality
far
up
in
the
air
from
the
contemplation
of
this
scene
i
was
suddenly
and
rudely
awakened
a
loud
rumbling
sound
rose
on
the
air
and
before
i
had
time
to
wonder
what
it
could
mean
a
heaving
of
the
ground
resembling
a
sent
me
flying
on
my
back
and
as
by
magic
the
silent
camp
became
alive
with
shouts
of
fear
and
wonder
as
everybody
rushed
out
of
the
tents
in
dismay
the
shocks
occurred
again
and
again
but
each
time
weaker
and
in
about
five
minutes
they
had
ceased
altogether
but
it
was
some
time
before
we
recovered
our
equanimity
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
experienced
an
earthquake
and
such
a
sickly
sensation
of
helplessness
as
comes
over
one
during
the
heaving
up
and
down
of
the
earth
would
i
should
think
be
hard
to
equal
our
guides
told
us
that
none
of
them
had
ever
felt
an
earthquake
in
patagonia
before
nor
had
they
ever
heard
of
one
having
taken
place
later
on
on
our
return
to
sandy
point
we
learnt
that
the
earthquake
had
caused
a
good
deal
of
disaster
in
the
colony
all
the
bottles
and
stores
in
pedro
shop
were
thrown
from
their
shelves
and
broken
and
there
were
few
inhabitants
in
the
colony
who
did
not
sustain
some
similar
loss
as
may
be
imagined
the
earthquake
provided
us
with
matter
for
conversation
for
some
time
and
in
that
respect
at
least
was
a
not
unwelcome
occurrence
breakfast
over
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
separate
into
two
parties
one
for
the
purpose
of
whilst
the
other
should
devote
its
energies
to
the
pursuit
of
the
guanaco
my
husband
and
preferring
the
latter
chase
rode
off
with
their
rifles
together
with
gregorio
and
guillaume
towards
the
hilly
country
we
had
crossed
the
day
before
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
my
brother
and
i
with
françois
started
off
along
a
ridge
of
hills
which
exactly
faced
our
camp
and
which
sloped
down
into
the
plains
below
we
were
followed
by
four
ostrich
hounds
and
were
mounted
on
the
best
and
fleetest
horses
we
could
select
out
of
our
tropilla
the
little
animal
that
i
bestrode
could
not
have
exceeded
fifteen
hands
he
was
a
little
bay
with
a
white
blaze
down
his
face
and
three
white
legs
he
would
clamber
up
precipitous
places
where
the
stones
and
rocks
crumbled
and
gave
way
beneath
his
feet
or
canter
down
a
steep
decline
and
jump
the
wide
gullies
with
the
greatest
ease
as
we
galloped
along
the
smoother
ground
which
intervened
between
the
hills
and
which
was
deeply
undermined
by
hundreds
of
holes
of
the
prairie
rat
his
activity
in
avoiding
a
fall
astonished
me
my
brother
was
equally
well
mounted
on
a
long
low
clever
black
who
had
the
reputation
of
great
speed
while
françois
rode
a
brown
with
handsome
arching
neck
and
tiny
head
as
we
rode
silently
along
with
our
eyes
well
about
us
in
the
hopes
of
sighting
an
ostrich
my
horse
suddenly
shied
at
something
white
lying
on
the
ground
at
a
few
paces
distant
throwing
the
reins
over
his
head
i
dismounted
and
walked
towards
the
spot
amongst
some
long
grass
i
discovered
a
deserted
nest
of
an
ostrich
containing
ten
or
eleven
eggs
and
calling
françois
to
examine
them
was
greatly
chagrined
to
find
that
none
of
them
were
fresh
with
the
superstition
of
an
françois
picked
up
a
feather
lying
close
at
hand
and
sticking
it
in
his
cap
assured
us
that
this
was
a
good
sign
and
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
we
came
across
one
of
these
birds
his
prediction
was
speedily
verified
for
on
reaching
the
summit
of
a
little
hill
up
which
we
had
slowly
and
stealthily
proceeded
two
small
gray
objects
suddenly
struck
my
eye
i
signed
to
françois
and
my
brother
who
where
riding
some
twenty
yards
behind
me
and
putting
spurs
to
my
horse
galloped
down
the
hill
towards
the
two
gray
objects
i
had
perceived
in
the
distance
choo
choo
shouted
françois
a
cry
by
which
the
cheer
their
dogs
on
and
intimate
to
them
the
proximity
of
game
past
me
like
lightning
the
four
eager
animals
rushed
bent
on
securing
the
prey
which
their
quick
sight
had
already
detected
the
ostriches
turned
one
look
on
their
pursuers
and
the
next
moment
they
wheeled
round
and
making
for
the
plain
scudded
over
the
ground
at
a
tremendous
pace
and
now
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
experience
all
the
glorious
excitement
of
an
my
little
horse
keen
as
his
rider
took
the
bit
between
his
teeth
and
away
we
went
up
and
down
the
hills
at
a
terrific
pace
on
and
on
flew
the
ostriches
closer
and
closer
crept
up
leona
a
small
red
scotch
deerhound
with
loca
a
wiry
black
lurcher
at
her
heels
who
in
turn
was
closely
followed
by
apiscuña
and
sultan
in
another
moment
the
little
red
dog
would
be
alongside
the
ostriches
suddenly
however
they
twisted
right
and
left
respectively
scudding
away
in
opposite
directions
over
the
plain
a
feint
which
of
course
gave
them
a
great
advantage
as
the
dogs
in
their
eagerness
shot
forward
a
long
way
before
they
were
able
to
stop
themselves
by
the
time
they
had
done
so
the
ostriches
had
got
such
a
start
that
seeing
pursuit
was
useless
we
called
the
dogs
back
we
were
very
much
disappointed
at
our
failure
and
in
no
very
pleasant
frame
of
mind
turned
our
heads
in
the
direction
of
our
camp
as
we
rode
along
we
were
surprised
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
man
on
horseback
galloping
towards
us
he
was
dressed
in
a
guanaco
robe
and
his
long
black
hair
floating
on
the
wind
gave
him
a
very
wild
look
an
indian
i
exclaimed
but
françois
shook
his
head
and
we
rode
up
to
meet
the
stranger
when
he
got
up
to
us
he
shook
hands
with
françois
whom
he
seemed
to
know
and
without
evincing
any
sign
of
curiosity
as
regarded
ourselves
turned
his
horse
round
and
prepared
to
accompany
us
i
observed
that
although
his
face
legs
and
hands
were
almost
as
as
those
of
an
indian
his
features
were
those
of
a
white
man
françois
presently
told
me
that
he
was
a
chilian
convict
who
had
deserted
from
sandy
point
a
good
many
years
ago
and
that
since
then
he
had
lived
among
the
indians
adopting
their
dress
and
customs
till
he
had
now
become
quite
one
of
them
in
reply
to
my
questions
it
appeared
that
he
was
camping
with
some
indians
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
they
had
been
out
hunting
and
he
was
just
returning
home
when
he
saw
us
and
having
nothing
better
to
do
thought
he
might
as
well
pay
a
visit
to
our
camp
we
were
a
good
deal
chaffed
when
we
got
home
on
the
score
of
our
my
husband
and
having
had
a
good
day
sport
bringing
plenty
of
guanaco
meat
back
with
them
over
pipes
and
coffee
that
night
a
serious
council
of
war
was
held
by
the
whole
of
our
party
as
regards
for
the
morrow
the
chilian
suggested
the
forming
of
a
circle
and
professed
himself
willing
in
return
for
our
hospitality
to
remain
another
day
and
join
in
the
affair
forming
a
circle
is
the
method
by
which
the
indians
nearly
always
obtain
game
it
is
formed
by
lighting
fires
round
a
large
area
of
ground
into
which
the
different
hunters
ride
from
all
sides
a
complete
circle
of
blazing
fires
is
thus
obtained
and
any
game
found
therein
is
pretty
sure
to
become
the
prey
of
the
dogs
as
no
ostrich
or
guanaco
will
face
a
fire
wherever
they
turn
they
see
before
them
a
column
of
smoke
or
are
met
by
dogs
and
horsemen
escape
becomes
almost
impossible
and
it
is
not
long
before
they
grow
bewildered
and
are
captured
in
anticipation
of
a
hard
day
work
on
the
morrow
we
hereupon
broke
up
our
council
of
war
and
turned
in
at
an
earlier
hour
than
usual
next
morning
the
horses
being
all
ready
we
lost
no
time
in
springing
into
the
saddle
leaving
storer
to
take
charge
of
the
camp
much
to
his
alarm
and
in
spite
of
his
earnest
remonstrance
the
poor
man
vainly
protested
that
were
the
indians
to
discover
our
retreat
he
would
be
perfectly
powerless
to
prevent
their
pillaging
the
whole
camp
especially
as
his
ignorance
of
their
jargon
as
he
scornfully
termed
the
tehuelche
language
would
place
him
in
a
most
helpless
position
regardless
of
his
arguments
and
imploring
looks
we
rode
away
determining
to
risk
the
improbable
intrusion
of
the
indians
whose
camp
lay
at
least
twenty
miles
distant
from
our
own
for
about
half
an
hour
we
followed
gregorio
and
the
chilian
along
a
line
of
broken
hillocks
after
which
calling
a
halt
we
sent
forward
guillaume
and
to
commence
the
first
and
most
distant
proceedings
of
the
circle
they
departed
at
a
brisk
canter
and
it
was
not
long
before
several
rising
columns
of
smoke
testified
that
they
were
already
busily
engaged
the
next
to
compose
the
centre
circle
were
my
husband
françois
and
shortly
after
supported
on
the
right
by
the
chilian
and
my
brother
immediately
on
their
left
gregorio
and
myself
commenced
operations
and
soon
a
distinct
circle
of
fires
might
be
seen
springing
quickly
up
from
all
points
i
could
not
help
being
greatly
impressed
with
the
novel
sight
now
before
me
from
the
high
plain
we
were
on
i
could
look
over
miles
and
miles
of
untrodden
desert
land
where
countless
herds
of
guanaco
were
roaming
in
peaceful
lazy
ease
in
the
distance
towered
the
peaks
of
the
andes
wrapped
in
their
cloak
of
mystery
lonely
and
unexplored
the
huge
columns
of
smoke
and
the
lurid
flames
of
the
lent
a
wild
appearance
to
the
thrilling
scene
to
which
the
frightened
knots
of
guanacos
which
were
hurrying
to
escape
from
the
circle
and
the
eager
galloping
horsemen
lent
additional
active
animation
for
some
time
gregorio
and
i
rode
slowly
and
silently
on
our
way
when
a
sudden
unexpected
bound
which
my
horse
gave
all
but
unseated
me
avestruz
avestruz
shouted
gregorio
and
turned
his
horse
with
a
quick
movement
choo
choo
plata
i
cry
to
the
dog
who
followed
at
my
horse
heels
as
a
fine
male
ostrich
scudded
away
towards
the
hills
we
had
just
left
with
the
speed
of
lightning
plata
has
sighted
him
and
is
straining
every
limb
to
reach
the
terrified
bird
he
is
a
plucky
dog
and
a
fleet
one
but
it
will
take
him
all
his
time
to
come
alongside
that
great
raking
ostrich
as
he
strides
away
in
all
the
conscious
pride
of
his
strength
and
speed
we
shall
lose
him
i
cry
half
mad
with
excitement
spurring
my
horse
who
is
beginning
to
gasp
and
falter
as
the
hill
up
which
we
are
struggling
grows
steeper
and
steeper
but
the
ostrich
suddenly
doubles
to
the
left
and
commences
a
hurried
descent
the
cause
is
soon
explained
for
in
the
direction
towards
which
he
has
been
making
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
rises
menacingly
in
his
path
and
baulked
of
the
refuge
he
had
hoped
to
find
amidst
the
hills
the
great
bird
is
forced
to
alter
his
course
and
make
swiftly
for
the
plains
below
but
swiftly
as
he
flies
along
so
does
plata
who
finds
a
race
much
more
suited
to
his
splendid
shoulders
and
rare
stride
foot
by
foot
he
lessens
the
distance
that
separates
him
from
his
prey
and
gets
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
fast
sinking
fast
tiring
bird
away
we
go
down
the
hill
unchecked
and
undefeated
by
the
numerous
obstacles
that
obstruct
the
way
plata
is
alongside
the
ostrich
and
gathers
himself
for
a
spring
at
the
bird
throat
he
has
him
he
has
him
i
shout
to
gregorio
who
does
not
reply
but
urges
his
horse
on
with
whip
and
spur
has
he
got
him
though
yes
no
the
ostrich
with
a
rapid
twist
has
shot
some
thirty
yards
ahead
of
his
enemy
and
whirling
round
makes
for
the
hills
once
more
and
now
begins
the
struggle
for
victory
the
ostrich
has
decidedly
the
best
of
it
for
plata
though
he
struggles
gamely
does
not
like
the
uphill
work
and
at
every
stride
loses
ground
there
is
another
fire
on
the
hill
above
but
it
lies
too
much
to
the
left
to
attract
the
bird
attention
who
has
evidently
a
safe
line
of
escape
in
view
in
that
direction
on
on
we
press
on
on
flies
the
ostrich
bravely
and
gamely
struggles
in
its
wake
poor
plata
can
he
stay
i
cry
to
gregorio
who
smiles
and
nods
his
head
he
is
right
the
dog
can
stay
for
hardly
have
the
words
left
my
lips
when
with
a
tremendous
effort
he
puts
on
a
spurt
and
races
up
alongside
the
ostrich
once
more
the
bird
points
for
the
plain
he
is
beginning
to
falter
but
he
is
great
and
strong
and
is
not
beaten
yet
it
will
take
all
plata
time
and
cunning
to
pull
that
magnificent
bird
to
the
ground
and
it
will
be
a
long
fierce
struggle
ere
the
gallant
creature
yields
up
his
life
unconscious
of
anything
but
the
exciting
chase
before
me
i
am
suddenly
disagreeably
reminded
that
there
such
a
thing
as
caution
and
necessity
to
look
where
you
are
going
to
for
putting
his
foot
in
an
unusually
deep
hole
my
little
horse
comes
with
a
crash
upon
his
head
and
turns
completely
over
on
his
back
burying
me
beneath
him
in
a
hopeless
muddle
fortunately
beyond
a
shaking
i
am
unhurt
and
remounting
endeavour
to
rejoin
the
now
somewhat
distant
chase
the
ostrich
gregorio
and
the
dog
have
reached
the
plain
and
as
i
gallop
quickly
down
the
hill
i
can
see
that
the
bird
has
begun
doubling
this
is
a
sure
sign
of
fatigue
and
shows
that
the
ostrich
strength
is
beginning
to
fail
him
nevertheless
it
is
a
matter
of
no
small
difficulty
for
one
dog
to
secure
his
prey
even
at
this
juncture
as
he
can
not
turn
and
twist
about
as
rapidly
as
the
ostrich
at
each
double
the
bird
shoots
far
ahead
of
his
pursuer
and
gains
a
considerable
advantage
away
across
the
plain
the
two
animals
fly
whilst
i
and
gregorio
press
eagerly
in
their
wake
the
excitement
grows
every
moment
more
intense
and
i
watch
the
close
struggle
going
on
with
the
keenest
interest
suddenly
the
stride
of
the
bird
grows
slower
his
doubles
become
more
frequent
showers
of
feathers
fly
in
every
direction
as
plata
seizes
him
by
the
tail
which
comes
away
in
his
mouth
in
another
moment
the
dog
has
him
by
the
throat
and
for
a
few
minutes
nothing
can
be
distinguished
but
a
gray
struggling
heap
then
gregorio
dashes
forward
and
throws
himself
off
his
horse

and
when
i

the

over
the

had
lasted
for
minutes
illustration
the
last
double
our
dogs
and
horses
were
in
a
most
pitiable
state
poor
plata
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
with
his
tongue
hot
and
fiery
lolling
out
of
his
mouth
and
his
sides
going
at
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
the
horses
with
their
heads
drooped
till
they
almost
touched
the
ground
and
their
bodies
streaming
with
perspiration
presented
a
most
pitiable
sight
and
while
gregorio
disembowelled
and
fastened
the
ostrich
together
i
loosened
their
girths
and
led
them
to
a
pool
hard
by
to
drink
at
length
they
became
more
comfortable
and
as
soon
as
they
seemed
in
a
fit
state
to
go
on
gregorio
and
i
lifted
the
huge
bird
on
to
his
horse
and
tied
it
across
the
animal
withers
encumbered
thus
gregorio
turned
to
depart
in
the
direction
of
the
camp
followed
by
plata
while
i
went
in
an
opposite
direction
in
search
of
my
companions
down
in
the
plain
it
was
not
long
before
i
distinguished
in
the
far
distance
an
ostrich
coming
straight
towards
me
closely
followed
by
a
dog
and
two
horsemen
galloping
to
meet
them
i
was
the
means
of
turning
the
bird
into
peaché
jaws
for
such
was
the
name
of
dog
the
two
horsemen
turned
out
to
be
the
old
fellow
in
question
and
my
brother
who
arrived
hot
and
full
of
excitement
on
the
scene
just
as
i
was
throwing
myself
from
my
horse
to
prevent
peaché
from
tearing
the
bird
to
pieces
leaving
to
complete
the
hunter
work
my
brother
and
i
rode
slowly
back
towards
our
camp
discussing
the
merits
of
our
horses
dogs
and
the
stamina
of
the
two
ostriches
we
had
slain
so
engrossed
were
we
that
we
could
hardly
believe
our
eyes
when
we
came
suddenly
in
full
view
of
our
snug
little
retreat
but
nevertheless
we
were
very
glad
to
dismount
and
refresh
ourselves
with
the
hot
coffee
which
we
found
old
storer
had
ready
waiting
one
by
one
the
other
hunters
dropped
in
they
had
all
been
successful
with
the
exception
of
guillaume
and
as
we
stood
grouped
round
the
five
large
ostriches
lying
on
the
ground
we
congratulated
ourselves
on
our
good
fortune
and
on
the
excellent
sport
we
had
had
at
dinner
we
passed
judgment
on
which
we
now
really
tasted
for
the
first
time
for
what
we
had
obtained
from
the
indian
camp
had
been
dry
and
unpalatable
we
thought
it
excellent
the
breast
and
wings
are
particularly
good
the
latter
much
resemble

after
a
four
days
stay
at
laguna
blanca
our
horses
being
sufficiently
rested
we
resolved
to
continue
our
journey
i
had
got
to
feel
quite
at
home
in
the
little
ravine
where
our
camp
had
been
pitched
and
notwithstanding
my
anxiety
to
push
forward
and
get
over
the
monotony
of
the
plains
as
soon
as
possible
in
leaving
it
felt
just
a
slight
touch
of
regret
each
bush
i
passed
recalled
some
trivial
incident
of
our
stay
and
came
in
for
a
share
of
the
i
inwardly
vouchsafed
to
all
my
late
surroundings
whilst
we
were
trotting
along
i
noticed
that
one
of
the
was
continually
looking
anxiously
back
and
on
counting
the
foals
i
found
that
one
was
missing
whose
attention
i
drew
to
this
fact
immediately
returned
to
our
camp
to
look
for
the
lost
animal
which
he
thought
had
probably
been
left
behind
in
a
ravine
where
the
horses
had
been
in
the
habit
of
grazing
in
the
meantime
we
rode
on
presently
passing
the
site
of
the
camp
of
the
indians
the
smoke
of
whose
fires
we
had
noticed
from
the
laguna
blanca
they
themselves
had
left
it
the
day
before
and
were
now
on
the
march
southwards
as
indicated
by
several
columns
of
smoke
which
we
could
see
on
the
distant
skyline
it
being
their
habit
when
on
the
march
to
light
fires
at
intervals
shortly
after
passing
the
indian
camp
we
were
startled
by
a
series
of
howls
given
vent
to
by
guillaume
dog
negro
whom
we
descried
struggling
with
some
animal
in
the
long
grass
in
a
second
he
was
joined
by
the
other
dogs
and
by
the
time
we
got
up
we
found
them
all
engaged
in
mortal
combat
with
a
huge
which
had
already
punished
negro
most
severely
and
was
defending
itself
fiercely
against
the
united
onslaught
of
its
enemies
two
revolver
shots
were
fired
at
it
without
effect
but
presently
gregorio
managed
to
kill
it
with
a
blow
from
the
bolas
up
to
its
last
gasp
it
spat
and
clawed
with
undaunted
fury
and
nearly
all
the
dogs
were
more
or
less
badly
wounded
poor
negro
in
particular
being
severely
gashed
and
torn
whilst
we
washed
the
dogs
in
a
pool
of
water
hard
by
gregorio
skinned
the
and
then
made
a
search
for
its
companion
which
during
the
fray
some
one
had
observed
making
good
its
retreat
however
his
search
was
fruitless
and
we
rode
forward
again
the
incident
just
related
furnishing
us
with
a
topic
for
conversation
wherewith
to
beguile
the
next
hour
or
so
meanwhile
rejoined
us
but
although
he
had
thoroughly
searched
all
the
country
in
the
vicinity
of
our
late
camp
he
had
been
unable
to
find
any
traces
of
the
missing
foal
which
had
doubtless
fallen
a
prey
to
some
puma
towards
evening
we
arrived
at
a
large
freshwater
lake
called
laguna
larga
by
the
shores
of
which
we
set
up
our
tents
my
husband
going
out
with
his
gun
managed
to
kill
an
ibis
the
first
any
of
us
had
shot
although
we
had
often
tried
to
do
so
whilst
at
laguna
blanca
being
aware
that
this
bird
makes
excellent
soup
this
one
was
put
in
the
pot
and
though
its
meat
proved
rather
tough
the
broth
it
gave
was
all
that
could
be
desired
laguna
larga
like
nearly
all
the
lakes
we
saw
in
patagonia
swarmed
with
and
amongst
other
birds
we
observed
two
flamingoes
whose
gorgeous
red
plumage
excited
our
covetousness
and
an
elaborate
was
organised
with
the
object
of
securing
one
of
them
however
they
never
gave
us
a
chance
and
sailed
majestically
away
at
the
first
approach
of
danger
our
road
the
next
day
lay
for
the
most
part
along
a
fertile
valley
down
the
middle
of
which
flowed
a
narrow
but
exceedingly
deep
stream
the
breadth
of
this
cañadon
was
about
five
miles
and
we
followed
its
windings
for
about
twenty
miles
its
whole
length
for
it
doubtless
stretched
down
to
the
must
have
been
about
miles
the
grass
was
tall
and
green
in
many
places
reaching
up
to
our
horses
bellies
as
equally
fertile
valleys
are
to
be
found
intersecting
the
barren
plains
in
all
directions
an
enormous
number
of
cattle
and
sheep
might
be
reared
in
this
country
were
it
not
for
the
heavy
snows
in
winter
and
the
floods
in
spring
which
latter
immerse
all
these
valleys
for
a
considerable
period
during
which
the
animals
would
have
to
seek
sustenance
on
the
plains
where
it
is
needless
to
say
they
would
not
find
it
as
we
emerged
from
the
valley
on
to
the
plains
an
animal
was
descried
on
the
which
at
first
we
took
for
a
gigantic
guanaco
but
which
presently
resolved
itself
into
a
horse
gregorio
having
seen
it
first
had
become
in
accordance
with
the
unwritten
law
of
the
pampas
its
owner
that
is
to
say
should
it
be
caught
so
taking
with
him
he
rode
off
to
the
left
with
the
intention
of
getting
behind
his
prospective
property
and
driving
it
towards
our
troop
this
he
accomplished
without
difficulty
the
horse
stood
staring
at
our
advancing
cavalcade
for
some
time
and
then
came
galloping
towards
us
with
loud
neighs
of
greeting
spreading
consternation
among
our
troop
who
neighed
and
snorted
in
return
apparently
by
no
means
pleased
at
the
sight
of
the
matters
were
peaceably
arranged
however
and
after
some
further
slight
demonstrations
he
was
admitted
into
the
troop
evidently
much
pleased
to
find
himself
among
his
own
kind
again
according
to
gregorio
he
had
belonged
to
some
indian
who
had
probably
lost
him
on
the
march
i
asked
gregorio
whether
the
owner
might
claim
the
horse
again
and
he
told
me
that
the
law
among
indians
is
that
the
finder
receives
about
of
the
value
of
the
object
found
from
the
owner
some
difficulty
generally
arises
in
these
cases
as
to
the
value
of
the
find
as
the
parties
naturally
and
depreciate
it
as
suits
their
respective
interests
this
being
especially
the
case
when
the
bargain
is
debated
between
an
indian
and
a
white
man
amongst
themselves
the
indians
are
remarkably
fair
in
their
dealings
but
as
they
know
that
the
traders
cheat
them
whenever
they
can
they
recognise
quite
another
standard
of
morality
in
their
dealings
with
the
latter
as
we
were
approaching
the
spot
where
we
intended
camping
one
of
the
mules
which
was
heading
the
troop
suddenly
turned
and
dashed
away
and
in
another
instant
the
whole
troop
broke
up
and
dispersed
galloping
in
all
directions
what
was
the
cause
of
this
stampede
we
pressed
quickly
forward
but
nothing
stirred
in
the
long
grass
though
we
scoured
everywhere
we
were
baffled
for
a
minute
it
a
puma
somewhere
said
gregorio
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
a
loud
rent
the
air
there
he
goes
there
he
goes
shouted
two
or
three
of
our
party
in
chorus
and
sure
enough
there
he
was
going
a
mighty
yellow
puma
slouching
swiftly
away
at
some
distance
to
our
left
with
my
brother
following
close
on
his
track
for
us
all
to
gallop
after
and
come
up
within
ten
yards
of
the
puma
was
the
work
of
a
moment
but
to
get
nearer
than
ten
yards
or
so
was
quite
another
matter
as
our
horses
were
quivering
with
fright
and
with
difficulty
were
kept
from
turning
tail
and
bolting
from
the
dread
presence
of
their
mortal
enemy
meanwhile
the
puma
finding
himself
surrounded
lay
sullenly
down
eyeing
us
with
dogged
hate
and
scarcely
seeming
to
heed
the
presence
of
the
dogs
who
were
growling
furiously
at
him
at
a
respectful
distance
from
his
claws
finding
it
useless
to
try
to
approach
on
horseback
my
brother
dismounted
and
a
rifle
being
at
hand
took
steady
aim
at
the
crouching
animal
and
fired
simultaneous
with
the
report
with
outstretched
paws
and
a
deep
growl
the
puma
sprang
forward
and
then
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
whilst
our
horses
becoming
wholly
unmanageable
reared
up
and
fairly
bolted
when
we
again
got
control
of
them
nothing
would
induce
them
to
return
to
the
spot
where
the
now
lifeless
body
of
the
puma
lay
and
we
had
to
dismount
and
walk
there
very
fierce
and
dangerous
it
looked
and
at
the
sight
of
its
ponderous
paws
with
their
sharp
talons
and
its
cruel
white
teeth
we
wondered
whether
if
it
knew
its
own
powers
the
puma
would
be
such
a
cowardly
animal
as
it
is
they
scarcely
ever
attack
man
even
when
brought
to
bay
but
lie
down
and
doggedly
meet
their
fate
though
they
can
kill
a
guanaco
with
one
blow
of
the
paw
and
pull
down
a
horse
with
similar
ease
the
indians
affirm
that
the
puma
only
bears
young
ones
in
two
years
but
whether
this
be
true
or
not
i
do
not
know
they
certainly
seem
very
scarce
comparatively
a
circumstance
which
may
be
due
to
this
peculiarity
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
indians
and
traders
destroy
a
good
number
annually
the
excitement
attendant
on
the
puma
demise
being
over
and
our
horses
having
been
driven
together
again
we
made
for
our
intended
camping
place
we
lodged
that
night
in
the
valley
i
have
described
above
and
here
for
the
first
time
since
we
reached
the
plains
the
night
was
wet
it
is
by
no
means
agreeable
to
hear
rain
pattering
down
on
the
canvas
of
one
tent
especially
when
one
has
doubts
as
to
the
waterproof
capabilities
of
the
canvas
and
as
yet
we
had
had
no
opportunity
of
testing
ours
fortunately
on
this
occasion
the
rain
did
not
last
long
and
excepting
a
general
sense
of
dampness
we
experienced
no
further
inconvenience
continuing
our
journey
on
the
following
day
we
reached
the
river
gallegos
which
we
forded
at
a
spot
called
paso
de
los
morros
these
morros
being
two
conically
shaped
hills
of
equal
height
which
form
a
striking
landmark
being
conspicuous
at
a
considerable
distance
the
river
at
the
time
was
very
low
but
owing
to
the
inequality
of
its
bed
and
the
rapidity
of
the
current
some
care
had
to
be
taken
in
crossing
the
ford
for
fear
any
of
the
packhorses
should
come
to
grief
we
passed
without
any
accident
however
and
pitched
our
camp
near
the
bank
under
shelter
of
a
snug
little
clump
of
beech
trees
we
liked
the
place
so
much
that
we
resolved
to
pass
a
couple
of
days
there
especially
as
the
packhorses
required
a
rest
after
the
long
march
from
laguna
blanca
the
first
day
we
dawdled
pleasantly
away
in
all
kinds
of
useful
occupations
such
as
cleaning
guns
writing
up
journals
though
i
am
bound
to
say
that
the
best
part
of
the
time
was
given
up
to
cooking
experiments
my
brother
and
both
being
anxious
to
prove
their
respective
superiority
in
the
culinary
department
much
amusement
was
afforded
us
by
a
mysterious
dish
which
my
brother
passed
the
whole
afternoon
in
elaborating
and
which
if
his
own
glowing
anticipations
had
been
verified
would
certainly
have
proved
a
triumph
of
skill
the
care
he
devoted
to
the
preparation
of
his
dish
and
the
impressive
secrecy
with
which
he
conducted
his
operations
led
us
into
the
firm
belief
that
a
most
agreeable
surprise
was
in
store
for
us
but
when
came
and
soup
and
joint
had
been
hurriedly
got
through
in
order
to
enable
us
to
do
all
the
more
justice
to
his
effort
the
surprise
for
surprise
it
was
turned
out
to
be
a
very
unpleasant
one
the
plat
on
which
so
much
care
had
been
bestowed
proving
to
be
a
homely
though
curious
concoction
of
rice
preserved
milk
and
brown
sugar
with
a
decided
taste
of
burn
and
after
swallowing
a
few
spoonfuls
even
its
concoctor
had
to
avow
with
a
grimace
that
his
exertions
had
resulted
in
a
failure
my
brother
having
thus
signally
proved
his
incapacity
for
occupying
the
high
office
of
cook
we
for
the
future
left
the
kitchen
department
to
francisco
supervision
and
very
well
we
fared
at
his
hands
the
next
day
was
spent
in
we
made
two
or
three
circles
but
game
seemed
very
scarce
and
we
were
unable
to
entrap
a
single
ostrich
we
were
going
home
towards
evening
rather
disconsolately
when
some
one
observed
an
ostrich
running
straight
towards
us
apparently
with
the
express
intention
of
obliging
us
by
allowing
himself
to
be
killed
but
as
we
started
into
a
gallop
to
meet
him
he
changed
his
mind
and
darted
off

our
whole
party
following
the
dogs
unfortunately
as
often
happens
when
they
are
wanted
had
fallen
behind
and
a
depression
in
the
plain
hid
us
from
their
view
it
seemed
rather
a
forlorn
chase
therefore
as
our
tired
horses
were
no
match
for
the
ostrich
who
drew
away
at
every
stride
to
our
surprise
however
he
suddenly
began
to
double
and
we
saw
that
he
was
being
hard
pressed
by
one
of
guillaume
dogs
from
which
he
had
evidently
been
escaping
when
he
met
us
with
fresh
zest
we
pushed
forward
spreading
out
in
a
semicircle
so
as
to
be
able
to
turn
the
ostrich
back
to
the
dog
should
he
double
round
our
way
an
exciting
chase
ensued
the
dog
a
clever
brute
did
its
utmost
to
make
the
ostrich
double
towards
us
but
without
success
and
the
speed
at
which
they
were
both
going
prevented
us
from
getting
any
nearer
the
dog
was
tiring
but
he
held
out
stoutly
double
after
double
slowly
exhausting
him
at
last
overshooting
himself
in
an
attempt
to
stop
short
he
turned
a
complete
somersault
and
the
ostrich
profiting
by
the
moment
respite
literally
set
all
sail
and
skimmed
away
with
a
strong
wind
in
his
favour
he
is

reining
in

no
the

the
river
cried
gregorio
spurring
the
harder
and
away
we
went
after
him
and
right
enough
there
was
the
river
glittering
before
us
with
the
ostrich
not
fifty
yards
from
the
bank
and
hurrah
our
whole
pack
of
dogs
close
on
his
heels
he
must
take
the
water
or
he
is
ours
in
another
second
he
reaches
the
bank
and
pauses
he
is
in
no
his
heart
has
failed
him
and
with
an
ominous
droop
of
his
wings
but
with
a
tremendous
spurt
he
has
darted
off
again
with
not
five
yards
between
him
and
the
straining
dogs
on
on
we
go
the
ostrich
gains
ground
ah
that
treacherous
bend
of
the
river
it
forces
him
to
swerve
round
and
in
a
second
he
is
met
by
gregorio
a
dexterous
double
rids
him
of
his
new
enemy
and
with
a
last
effort
he
shoots
forward
again
but
the
circle
closes
the
shouts
of
the
horsemen
on
all
sides
bewilder
him
he
hesitates
a
second
but
in
that
second
the
dogs
are
upon
him
and
the
next
he
lies
a
struggling
quivering
mass
of
feathers
horses
dogs
and
men
we
are
all
panting
and
breathless
the
dogs
so
hot
had
been
the
pace
were
too
blown
to
move
and
even
when
francisco
began
to
cut
up
the
bird
this
proceeding
usually
of
such
interest
to
them
on
account
of
the
savoury
perquisites
which
fell
to
their
share
scarcely
excited
their
languid
attention
we
were
rather
tired
when
we
got
home
and
after
dinner
the
run
having
been
most
minutely
discussed
in
all
its
bearings
we
were
all
glad

in

jogging
along
over
the
plains
with
the
hopes
of
a
speedy
arrival
at
the
cordilleras
to
cheer
us
under
the
depression
of
spirits
which
the
dreary
monotony
of
the
country
could
not
fail
to
produce
the
character
of
the
landscape
was
what
we
had
been
accustomed
to
since
leaving
cabo
negro
being
in
this
region
if
anything
possibly
more
barren
than
usual
this
day
ride
was
memorable
for
the
immense
number
of
guanacos
which
covered
the
plains
in
all
directions
on
arriving
at
a
broad
depression
we
were
surprised
by
the
sight
of
a
herd
of
these
animals
which
could
not
have
numbered
less
than
five
thousand
this
enormous
living
mass
defiled
past
us
up
the
side
and
over
the
brow
of
an
escarpment
which
bound
the
depression
referred
to
occupying
a
space
of
time
of
about
ten
minutes
although
they
were
going
at
a
very
quick
pace
and
once
or
twice
before
the
day
was
over
we
met
an
equally
numerous
herd
how
such
an
extraordinary
number
of
animals
can
find
subsistence
on
the
barren
plains
which
they
even
seem
to
prefer
to
the
grassy
ravines
is
a
matter
difficult
of
explanation
certain
it
is
that
the
withered
pampa
grass
must
contain
great
nourishing
properties
as
the
guanacos
thrive
and
grow
very
fat
on
it
although
they
are
generally
rather
shy
we
passed
one
herd
composed
of
some
unusually
tame
animals
as
we
approached
them
instead
of
running
away
the
whole
herd
came
slowly
trotting
towards
us
staring
at
us
with
naïve
unconcern
which
showed
that
they
were
innocent
of
the
chase
as
it
chanced
we
had
plenty
of
meat
so
we
left
them
unmolested
it
was
not
often
that
we
found
them
so
tame
especially
when
we
happened
to
be
short
of
meat
in
such
cases
with
the
usual
perverseness
of
things
they
would
scarcely
allow
one
to
approach
within
as
we
went
on
we
observed
a
column
of
smoke
to
the
westward
which
gregorio
judged
to
proceed
from
some
fire
near
the
cordilleras
and
from
his
account
it
marked
the
camp
of
an
eccentric
englishman
named
greenwood
who
it
appears
particularly
affects
that
region
and
who
scrupulously
avoids
contact
with
his
scarcely
ever
coming
down
to
sandy
point
in
fact
according
to
gregorio
he
seemed
to
live
the
life
of
a
hermit
he
had
renounced
the
world
and
its
vanities
even
to
the
extent
of
disdaining
the
ordinary
rough
comforts
of
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
pampa
clothed
in
the
most
primitive
fashion
he
roams
along
the
slopes
of
the
cordilleras
and
rather
than
make
a
trip
to
the
colony
to
lay
in
a
store
of
provisions
passes
a
whole
year
on
a
diet
of
ostrich
and
guanaco
meat
pure
and
simple
i
was
rather
interested
in
this
species
of
wild
man
of
the
woods
and
kept
a
sharp
look
out
as
we
journeyed
through
that
region
in
the
hopes
of
seeing
him
but
if
near
us
at
any
time
and
of
course
our
fires
had
he
chosen
to
come
gave
sufficient
indication
of
our
whereabouts
he
did
not
relax
his
rule
of
exclusiveness
in
our
favour
and
i
consequently
never
had
an
opportunity
of
making
his
acquaintance
during
the
march
we
started
up
a
male
ostrich
which
had
about
forty
young
ones
under
its
care
though
we
called
our
dogs
back
nothing
could
restrain
them
and
they
gave
chase
killing
one
of
the
small
ostriches
before
we
could
get
up
to
them
the
male
bird
and
the
others
escaped
the
flesh
of
the
young
ostrich
is
not
very
palatable
so
we
left
the
bird
taking
only
its
legs
which
make
very
nice
handles
for
umbrellas
and
whips
on
this
day
again
distinguished
himself
by
losing
the
way
he
having
been
entrusted
by
the
other
guides
with
the
leadership
on
this
occasion
as
he
was
supposed
to
be
better
acquainted
than
any
one
with
this
particular
region
for
quite
two
hours
we
followed
him
in
all
directions
through
an
extensive
beechwood
thicket
in
search
of
the
springs
we
were
to
camp
by
that
night
and
when
they
were
at
last
found
it
was
by
gregorio
and
in
quite
another
direction
than
the
one
in
which
with
his
usual
pertinacious
confidence
was
taking
us
he
came
in
for
a
good
deal
of
abuse
from
his
colleagues
and
a
fair
share
of
black
looks
from
us
all
of
which
he
bore
with
the
cheerful
indifference
which
characterised
him
under
all
circumstances
the
present
was
to
be
our
last
camp
among
beeches
as
we
had
now
to
strike
across
a
perfectly
woodless
region
on
our
way
to
the
point
at
which
we
intended
entering
the
cordilleras
these
occasional
patches
of
beeches
are
only
to
be
found
in
the
vicinity
of
the
mountains
in
the
plains
that
stretch
down
to
the
coast
nothing
is
to
be
met
with
in
the
way
of
fuel
but
berberis
and
a
few
other
scrubby
kinds
of
bushes
we
therefore
made
the
most
of
our
present
abundance
of
wood
and
revelled
in
huge
fires
in
order
to
lay
in
a
store
of
warm
memories
at
least
to
carry
with
us
into
the
bleak
region
we
were
about
to
enter
at
dinner
this
day
we
tasted
a
novelty
in
the
way
of
fowl
of
such
excellence
that
i
can
not
let
the
occasion
pass
without
expatiating
for
a
moment
on
its
merits
in
the
daytime
we
had
met
with
large
flights
of
a
bird
which
the
natives
call
chorlito
or
batatu
in
species
something
between
a
golden
plover
and
a
woodcock
these
birds
come
down
to
patagonia
in
incredible
numbers
at
this
season
to
feast
on
the
ripe
cranberries
which
grow
everywhere
in
profusion
and
on
which
the
ostriches
ibis
and
wild
geese
all
feed
and
thrive
we
had
shot
some
of
these
chorlitos
and
they
had
been
roasted
for
dinner
on
the
spit
along
with
some
snipe
and
wild
duck
we
had
brought
with
us
from
gallegos
at
dinner
however
they
were
at
first
rather
neglected
as
we
had
got
rather
tired
of
birds
having
had
so
much
of
them
at
laguna
blanca
presently
however
dinner
being
finished
some
one
of
our
party
in
a
spirit
of
careless
curiosity
rather
than
from
any
desire
to
satisfy
an
already
satiated
appetite
pulled
one
of
these
chorlitos
off
the
spit
and
with
a
air
took
a
bite
of
it
but
when
he
had
done
so
the
sudden
alteration
in
his
bearing
from
apathy
to
activity
was
a
sight
to
see
the
expression
on
his
face
till
then
one
of
weary
indifference
gave
way
to
a
look
of
intense
astonishment
which
finally
became
one
of
placid
delight
as
bit
by
bit
the
chorlito
disappeared
down
his
throat
though
he
did
not
speak
his
silent
action
spoke
volumes
of
eloquent
recommendation
and
as
may
be
imagined
we
were
soon
all
engaged
in
eating
chorlitos
for
a
time
no
sound
being
heard
but
the
smacking
of
lips
the
crunching
of
bones
and
occasionally
such
exclamations
as
stunning
by
jove
delicious
etc
etc
the
fact
is
we
had
discovered
what
some
persian
king
offered
half
his
kingdom
for
a
new
emotion
for
so
seductively
succulent
so
exquisitely
flavoured
so
far
beyond
anything
the
gourmet
might
dream
of
in
the
sublimest
flight
of
his
imagination
is
the
flesh
of
the
chorlito
that
the
sensation
it
produces
on
the
palate
when
tasted
for
the
first
time
may
without
hyperbole
be
described
as
rising
to
the
dignity
of
an
emotion
unfortunately
as
we
travelled
northward
we
seemed
to
leave
the
region
of
these
birds
and
only
on
this
and
two
other
occasions
were
we
able
to
feast
upon
them
we
witnessed
a
phenomenon
that
night
in
the
shape
of
a
moon
rainbow
and
many
were
the
conjectures
as
to
whether
it
presaged
good
or
bad
weather
rain
is
the
one
thing
above
all
others
calculated
to
make
an
life
unpleasant
and
a
fear
of
it
being
constantly
present
to
our
minds
nearly
every
evening
meteorological
speculations
formed
a
staple
topic
of
conversation
for
the
whole
camp
a
great
amount
of
weather
wisdom
was
developed
among
us
and
very
soon
a
party
spirit
was
imported
into
the
question
our
camp
splitting
into
two
sections
optimists
and
pessimists
just
before
bedtime
the
sky
would
be
conned
and
the
various
weather
indications
eagerly
discussed
often
with
some
heat
and
it
was
amusing
to
see
how
frequently
the
optimists
would
enlist
as
arguments
in
favour
of
their
prophecies
of
fine
weather
the
very
same
phenomena
of
cloud
or
temperature
on
which
on
the
other
hand
the
pessimists
grounded
their
equally
confident
prognostications
of
rain
on
occasions
when
these
discussions
had
been
carried
on
with
more
than
usual
earnestness
should
the
rain
suddenly
begin
to
patter
down
on
the
tents
in
the
middle
of
the
night
one
might
often
hear
conversations
like
the
following
in
tone
of
triumph
evidently
pleased
that
it
was
raining
as
his
antagonist
was
thereby
confounded
well
who
was
right
about
the
rain
i
told
you
it
was
sure
to
come
cheerily
and
half
implying
that
he
believes
it
raining
at
all
it
is
not
raining
well
a
drop
or
two
perhaps
but
that
nothing
it
will
soon
be
over
fervently
praying
that
it
may
rain
cats
and
dogs
for
the
next
twelve
hours
you
will
think
it
something
though
when
you
are
swamped
confidently
it
bound
to
rain
till
morning
scornfully
rain
till
morning
stuff
why
it
never
rains
long
with
a
full
moon
or
no
moon
as
may
suit
the
case
derisively
that
exactly
when
it
does
rain
you
know
that
pertinaciously
why
only
yesterday
you
said
yourself
that
one
might
be
certain
it
would
not
rain
long
with
a
full
moon
so
there
conveniently
forgetful
i
sure
i
never
said
anything
of
the
kind
gives
vent
to
a
sleepy
but
uncomplimentary
ejaculation
against
people
generally
who
do
know
what
they
are
talking
about
retorts
with
drowsy
ditto
whereupon
follows
silence
or
silence
broken
by
snores
on
this
particular
evening
the
halo
was
naturally
a
strong
feature
in
the
discussion
and
much
ingenious
special
pleading
was
employed
on
both
sides
to
prove
that
its
presence
was
an
infallible
indication
of
rain
or
no
rain
this
time
the
optimists
gained
a
signal
victory
as
the
night
was
fine
throughout
the
next
day
was
spent
in
shooting
down
by
a
big
lake
which
lay
about
a
couple
of
miles
distant
from
the
camp
i
shot
a
great
many
lovely
specimens
of
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
seen
before
and
loaded
my
horse
with
a
great
quantity
of
geese
duck
and
plover
riding
home
quietly
after
my
day
sport
i
started
up
a
big
ostrich
who
rose
from
the
ground
not
more
than
a
couple
of
yards
distant
how
i
longed
for
one
of
the
greyhounds
and
shouted
loudly
to
françois
whom
i
could
descry
in
camp
idly
doing
nothing
but
he
could
not
or
would
not
hear
galloping
towards
him
i
hastily
explained
in
which
direction
the
ostrich
had
disappeared
and
mounting
his
horse
he
went
off
in
pursuit
an
hour
later
he
returned
he
had
come
across
the
ostrich
and
given
chase
but
the
bird
taking
to
the
beech
woods
had
disappeared
therein
closely
followed
by
the
dogs
after
a
long
and
fruitless
search
for
both
he
had
been
obliged
to
return
without
his
dogs
to
the
camp
doubtless
as
he
observed
they
had
managed
to
kill
their
prey
and
were
even
then
indulging
in
a
heavy
feed
his
words
were
verified
when
later
on
the
animals
returned
presenting
an
undeniable
appearance
of
having
partaken
of
a
large
repast
gregorio
had
been
absent
all
day
in
search
of
guanaco
but
as
he
had
gone
on
foot
and
taken
no
dogs
with
him
he
had
been
unable
to
secure
the
one
or
two
which
he
had
managed
to
wound
so
altogether
our
attempts
in
the
chase
did
not
on
this
occasion
flourish

the
immense
plateau
over
which
we
rode
for
six
or
seven
hours
was
remarkable
for
its
gloom
and
barrenness
even
in
a
region
where
all
is
sterility
and
dreariness
there
was
no
sun
and
the
sky
lowering
and
dark
formed
a
fit
counterpart
to
the
plain
which
stretched
flatly
away
to
the
indistinct
horizon
gray
mournful
and
silent
we
could
not
help
being
affected
by
the
aspect
of
the
scenery
around
us
and
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
felt
anything
to
equal
the
depression
of
spirits
to
which
i
in
common
with
all
our
party
fell
a
prey
and
to
whose
influence
even
the
guides
succumbed
for
once
they
drove
the
troop
along
without
enlivening
their
work
with
the
customary
cheery
cries
of
iegua
iegua
mula
mula
and
the
very
bells
of
the
madrinas
seemed
to
have
a
muffled
solemn
sound
very
unlike
their
usual
lively
jingle
a
single
incident
occurred
during
that
day
march
a
little
guanaco
which
had
lost
its
mother
somehow
seeing
us
coming
instead
of
running
away
trotted
trustingly
towards
us
unfortunately
our
bloodthirsty
dogs
dashed
out
and
threw
it
before
we
could
get
up
to
stop
them
the
poor
thing
got
up
again
however
and
at
first
did
not
seem
much
hurt
it
was
the
sweetest
little
creature
imaginable
with
soft
silky
fur
and
bright
gentle
eyes
and
it
thrust
its
nose
against
my
cheek
in
a
caressing
manner
without
the
least
sign
of
fear
i
determined
to
carry
it
with
me
in
hopes
that
as
it
got
bigger
it
would
learn
to
keep
with
our
troop
especially
as
the
mare
who
had
lost
her
filly
at
laguna
blanca
would
have
made
an
excellent
for
it
but
i
hardly
formed
the
idea
when
the
little
guanaco
began
to
stagger
about
and
it
became
evident
that
it
must
have
received
some
bite
from
the
dogs
which
we
had
not
noticed
on
examining
it
this
proved
to
be
the
case
indeed
in
a
few
minutes
its
eyes
glazed
and
to
my
grief
in
a
very
short
time
it
died
apparently
without
suffering
i
would
have
given
anything
that
it
could
have
lived
as
i
am
sure
it
would
have
become
attached
to
me
and
finally
have
found
its
way
to
england
with
us
tame
guanacos
are
often
kept
at
sandy
point
and
their
gentle
ways
and
amiable
dispositions
make
them
charming
pets
we
were
thoroughly
tired
of
our
dull
march
when
we
at
last
arrived
at
a
ravine
where
there
were
a
few
pools
of
water
and
where
we
camped
for
the
night
as
we
were
on
short
fuel
rations
the
fire
was
allowed
to
go
out
directly
after
dinner
and
we
went
to
bed
now
the
only
warm
place
off
again
the
next
day
the
clump
of
peaks
mentioned
above
growing
more
distinct
but
still
terribly
far
and
no
wood
to
be
got
till
we
reached
them
plains
as
usual
studded
with
guanacos
but
having
no
time
to
go
out
with
our
rifles
we
had
to
confine
ourselves
to
ostrich
meat
of
these
birds
there
was
an
abundance
and
many
an
exciting
run
we
had
pursuing
them
were
numerous
too
but
having
eaten
every
imaginable
species
geese
duck
teal
widgeon
snipe
barbary
duck
we
were
quite
tired
of
them
after
another
long
march
we
camped
in
an
open
shelterless
ravine
and
then
again
pushed
hurriedly
on
our
stock
of
fuel
getting
ominously
low
towards
the
tantalising
clump
of
peaks
which
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
ride
scarcely
seemed
to
come
any
nearer
they
were
now
beginning
to
disappear
as
we
descended
into
an
immense
basin
which
lay
between
us
and
them
and
whose
farther
end
was
bound
by
a
succession
of
plateaus
rising
abruptly
one
over
the
other
as
it
appeared
to
us
though
when
we
ultimately
came
up
to
them
we
found
the
graduating
ascent
almost
imperceptible
after
camping
one
night
in
a
most
disagreeable
sandy
region
where
our
food
and
clothes
and
furs
all
got
impregnated
with
grit
and
dust
and
where
we
burned
our
last
stick
we
again
pushed
on
with
the
unpleasant
knowledge
that
that
night
we
should
possibly
have
to
camp
without
a
fire
to
warm
ourselves
and
cook
our
food
the
basin
we
were
now
crossing
seemed
interminable
we
were
to
camp
that
night
at
the
foot
of
the
escarpment
which
bound
its
farther
end
whence
to
the
mountains
was
only
one
day
march
we
were
now
out
of
sight
of
the
latter
again
but
we
were
cheered
by
the
comforting
consciousness
that
each
step
was
bringing
us
nearer
to
them
just
as
it
was
getting
dark
after
a
weary
day
ride
we
reached
a
brawling
which
swept
along
the
base
of
an
escarpment
and
which
we
hailed
as
the
first
sign
that
we
were
at
last
approaching
the
cordilleras
fording
it
we
pitched
our
camp
in
the
long
green
grass
just
under
shelter
of
the
escarpment
but
before
unsaddling
eager
to
see
how
near
we
had
come
to
the
clump
of
peaks
which
had
so
long
been
before
our
eyes
we
rode
up
the
escarpment
from
the
top
of
which
we
hoped
to
get
a
good
view
of
the
country
westward
our
expectations
were
not
disappointed
there
seemingly
not
a
mile
away
rose
up
compact
and
dark
not
the
huddled
clump
of
peaks
we
had
seen
two
days
ago
but
a
mighty
mountain
chain
which
lost
itself
westward
in
the
gathering
dusk
of
evening
standing
like
a
mysterious
barrier
between
the
strange
country
we
had
just
crossed
and
a
possibly
still
stranger
country
beyond
the
sun
had
long
set
and
the
base
of
the
mountains
was
wrapped
in
darkness
but
their
jagged
crests
stood
clearly
defined
against
the
light
which
still
glimmered
in
the
sky
and
here
and
there
a
peak
higher
than
its
comrades
still
retained
a
faint
roseate
glow
which
contrasted
strangely
with
the
gray
gloom
of
all
below
for
a
long
time
after
complete
darkness
had
fallen
over
everything
i
stood
alone
giving
myself
up
to
the
influence
of
the
emotions
the
scene
described
awoke
in
me
and
endeavouring
though
vainly
to
analyse
the
feeling
which
the
majestic
loneliness
of
patagonian
scenery
always
produced
in
my
mind
a
feeling
which
i
can
only
compare
for
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
seize
on
any
definite
feature
of
the
many
vague
sensations
which
compose
it
to
those
called
up
by
one
of
beethoven
grand
severe
yet
mysteriously
soft
sonatas
i
was
awakened
from
my
reverie
by
francisco
who
was
wandering
about
trying
to
gather
a
few
dry
sticks
for
the
fire
fortunately
he
managed
to
collect
enough
to
enable
us
to
cook
a
tolerable
dinner
with
having
eaten
which
as
usual
when
we
were
fireless
we
sought
our
couches
as
speedily
as
possible
the
morning
broke
with
every
sign
of
bad
weather
the
air
was
heavy
and
sultry
a
hot
dry
wind
blew
over
the
plains
whirling
up
clouds
of
fine
dust
and
the
was
by
dark
masses
of
clouds
of
threatening
aspect
we
saddled
and
packed
up
as
hurriedly
as
possible
fervently
hoping
that
the
rain
which
sooner
or
later
we
saw
must
come
would
kindly
hold
over
till
we
had
reached
our
destination
as
we
journeyed
on
the
sultriness
grew
more
and
more
oppressive
and
we
were
vexed
by
innumerable
swarms
of
minute
gnats
which
got
into
our
eyes
and
mouths
buzzed
about
us
in
a
hopelessly
persistent
manner
and
by
no
means
allayed
the
state
of
irritation
the
combined
influence
of
dust
and
heat
had
brought
us
into
a
slight
diversion
presently
occurred
by
the
appearance
of
an
animal
whose
claims
to
our
polite
and
immediate
attention
were
not
to
be
denied
this
was
an
enormous
puma
who
suddenly
sprang
up
from
the
midst
of
our
cavalcade
sending
the
mules
and
luggage
horses
stampeding
away
in
all
directions
true
to
its
cowardly
nature
the
animal
slouched
hurriedly
off
and
disappeared
down
the
side
of
a
ravine
quick
as
thought
we
pursued
it
but
fast
as
we
galloped
not
a
trace
of
it
was
to
be
seen
at
a
short
distance
from
where
we
stood
eagerly
searching
for
the
vanished
animal
i
perceived
a
small
bush
growing
the
only
one
for
miles
round
and
to
this
i
pointed
as
the
probable
place
where
the
brute
had
sought
a
we
lost
no
time
in
galloping
towards
the
spot
and
the
terrified
snorting
of
our
horses
when
we
drew
near
assured
us
of
the
correctness
of
my
surmise
and
put
us
on
our
guard
we
caught
sight
of
him
as
he
crouched
with
angry
glowing
eyes
and
an
expression
on
his
face
which
on
discovering
that
none
of
us
carried
a
rifle
was
the
reverse
of
reassuring
especially
as
we
knew
from
our
guides
that
for
some
reason
or
other
these
cordillera
pumas
are
fiercer
than
their
kindred
of
the
plains
and
often
attack
their
assailants
a
piece
of
temerity
the
latter
have
never
been
known
to
be
capable
of
fortunately
at
this
moment
my
husband
came
up
with
a
gun
though
indeed
it
was
only
loaded
with
small
shot
dismounting
hastily
he
approached
within
eight
or
nine
yards
of
the
growling
animal
bang
bang
went
his
gun
and
through
the
cloud
of
smoke
we
saw
the
puma
jump
up
in
the
air
and
fall
backwards
on
the
bush
for
a
moment
or
two
it
rolled
about
in
the
throes
of
death
and
then
with
a
last
growl
stretched
itself
slowly
out
and
lay
still
gregorio
who
arrived
at
this
moment
set
to
work
at
once
to
remove
its
skin
the
guides
all
declared
it
to
be
the
biggest
puma
they
had
ever
seen
the
skin
which
adorns
the
floor
of
the
room
where
i
am
at
present
writing
measures
exactly
nine
feet
from
the
tip
of
the
tail
to
the
point
of
the
nose
we
then
hurried
on
again
anxiously
scanning
the
weather
which
meanwhile
had
grown
more
and
more
threatening
the
sultriness
had
increased
so
as
to
have
become
almost
unbearable
and
the
swarms
of
gnats
above
alluded
to
had
grown
numerous
in
proportion
before
long
a
fearful
thunderstorm
burst
over
our
heads
and
for
a
short
time
the
rain
came
down
in
sheets
then
a
shift
of
the
wind
changed
the
temperature
again
it
became
quite
chilly
and
the
heavy
rain
resolved
itself
into
a
thick
drizzling
mist
which
soon
wetted
us
to
the
skin
for
hours
we
rode
in
this
comfortless
plight
wet
cold
and
tired
and
by
no
means
cheered
by
the
aspect
of
the
country
the
little
we
could
see
of
which
most
of
it
being
hidden
by
the
mist
aforesaid
looking
blacker
and
sadder
than
ever
illustration
the
puma
we
were
in
hopes
that
at
least
before
evening
it
would
clear
up
as
the
prospect
of
having
to
pitch
our
camp
in
the
drizzling
sleet
was
far
from
pleasant
but
as
it
grew
darker
the
fog
increased
in
thickness
and
soon
we
could
hardly
see
fifty
paces
ahead
of
our
horses
noses
how
gregorio
managed
to
find
the
way
i
do
know
at
last
it
being
as
near
as
i
could
judge
about
sunset
we
descended
a
very
steep
declivity
and
came
on
to
what
appeared
to
be
a
ravine
of
the
ordinary
kind
where
grass
and
underwood
were
apparently
abundant
we
halted
at
a
semicircle
of
tall
bushes
and
set
disconsolately
to
work
to
get
up
the
tents
this
by
no
means
easy
task
being
accomplished
we
collected
the
provisions
and
cartridges
together
and
got
them
under
shelter
into
the
smaller
of
the
two
tents
our
rugs
furs
and
coverings
were
wet
through
so
we
carried
them
into
the
other
tent
and
proceeded
to
wring
them
and
lay
them
out
to
dry
this
being
done
we
turned
our
attention
towards
making
a
fire
but
the
guides
and
everybody
declared
the
attempt
impossible
and
indeed
so
it
seemed
for
there
was
not
a
dry
twig
or
blade
of
grass
to
be
found
anywhere
back
we
all
crept
into
our
damp
tents
and
prepared
to
dine
as
genially
as
we
could
off
sardines
and
dry
biscuit
but
though
we
might
choose
to
resign
ourselves
thus
supinely
to
discomfort
old
for
his
part
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
do
so
whilst
the
discussion
as
to
the
possibility
of
making
a
fire
had
been
carried
on
after
listening
a
minute
or
two
to
the
arguments
which
were
being
urged
proving
conclusively
that
nothing
could
be
done
towards
it
he
silently
withdrew
and
busied
himself
in
setting
up
his
own
little
tent
a
rather
dilapidated
one
by
the
way
as
whenever
he
required
something
wherewith
to
patch
up
a
rent
in
his
curious
garments
he
was
in
the
habit
of
supplying
his
want
by
cutting
out
a
piece
of
the
canvas
of
his
casa
as
he
called
it
an
ingenious
method
of
robbing
peter
to
pay
paul
meanwhile
we
had
retired
to
our
tents
and
were
beginning
to
arrange
our
furs
preparatory
to
going
to
bed
when
i
heard
some
conversation
going
on
between
my
husband
and
the
latter
an
inveterate
maté
drinker
and
who
i
must
say
had
been
the
only
one
at
the
council
who
had
expressed
himself
hopefully
as
regarded
the
possibility
of
making
a
fire
looking
out
of
the
tent
i
saw
them
all
crouched
under
a
bush
dripping
wet
but
earnestly
engaged
in
some
elaborate
preparations
for
conquering
damp
and
getting
soaked
wood
to
burn
finding
they
disregarded
my
friendly
advice
to
save
themselves
the
trouble
of
doing
what
could
only
be
termed
useless
i
withdrew
into
my
tent
again
half
an
hour
later
i
could
still
hear
them
bravely
battling
against
the
inevitable
but
presently
went
past
my
tent
with
a
kettle
in
his
hand
the
fire
is
burning
is
it
i
called
out
ironically
to
him
no
but
it
will
very
soon
he
replied
meanwhile
i
am
going
to
fill
the
kettle
would
you
like
tea
or
coffee
i
answered
something
sarcastic
but
sighed
i
certainly
would
have
given
anything
for
a
cup
of
hot
tea
the
hopeful
expression
of
mr
b
face
had
struck
me
so
covering
myself
up
in
a
cloak
i
went
up
to
where
was
busy
at
work
to
see
if
really
there
was
any
hope
of
his
succeeding
i
found
he
had
stuck
four
little
stakes
in
the
ground
over
which
a
cloth
was
drawn
under
whose
shelter
he
had
built
an
elaborate
structure
of
wooden
matches
laid
crosswise
one
over
the
other
so
as
to
be
handy
when
required
over
these
lay
a
small
heap
of
fine
twigs
as
dry
as
could
be
procured
as
well
as
some
stout
sticks
and
finally
several
logs
which
he
informed
me
would
soon
be
merrily
blazing
everything
being
ready
he
applied
a
light
to
the
matches
and
as
soon
as
they
began
to
blaze
added
the
twigs
which
in
their
turn
after
a
little
doubtful
spluttering
took
fire
and
presently
this
was
the
critical
moment
the
sticks
were
laid
on
for
a
time
my
worst
fears
seemed
about
to
be
realised
the
sticks
only
smoked
viciously
the
matches
had
long
burned
away
and
the
twigs
now
began
to
glow
doubtfully
but
old
did
not
give
in
without
a
struggle
kneeling
down
he
tried
gently
to
fan
the
fading
glow
with
his
breath
at
times
as
we
anxiously
watched
it
it
seemed
to
gain
strength
at
others
it
became
reduced
to
a
single
spark
but
patience
conquered
at
last
the
glow
spread
the
sticks
began
to
blaze
and
before
long
there
was
a
good
blazing
fire
which
brought
every
one
from
his
tent
especially
as
meantime
the
rain
had
ceased
though
a
thick
mist
still
hung
over
everything
making
the
darkness
of
the
night
still
more
intense
kettles
were
put
on
to
boil
maté
tea
coffee
imbibed
and
francisco
prepared
an
excellent
la
discussing
which
blessings
were
invoked
on
head
to
his
perseverance
these
comforts
being
due
supper
over
we
groped
our
way
back
to
our
tents
and
enveloped
in
a
dense
damp
mist
went
to
sleep
not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
inhospitable
greeting
the
cordilleras
had

a
surprise
a
strange
scene
an
idle
day
califaté
berries
a
dilemma
mosquitoes
a
good
shot
the
next
morning
i
was
pleasantly
awakened
by
a
bright
ray
of
sunshine
which
forced
its
way
through
the
opening
in
my
tent
leaving
me
little
inclination
to
sleep
any
longer
i
lost
no
time
in
getting
up
and
stepped
out
anxious
to
see
what
kind
of
country
we
had
got
into
under
cover
of
the
fog
of
the
previous
day
for
a
moment
i
was
quite
bewildered
by
the
contrast
of
the
scene
now
before
me
and
the
dreary
impression
the
unfavourable
weather
conditions
had
lent
to
the
country
on
our
arrival
i
found
we
were
camped
in
a
broad
valley
which
looked
bright
and
smiling
beneath
a
clear
blue
sky
and
a
warm
sun
a
slight
breeze
swept
over
the
long
green
grass
which
was
studded
here
and
there
with
clumps
of
califaté
bushes
and
an
enlivening
colour
variety
was
given
to
the
verdant
carpet
by
occasional
tracts
of
white
and
yellow
flowers
one
end
of
the
valley
was
bound
by
some
tall
hills
covered
with
dark
patches
of
beech
trees
and
beyond
these
again
ridge
above
ridge
range
above
range
the
snow
and
glacier
covered
cordilleras
of
the
andes
towered
majestically
to
the
sky
the
air
was
marvellously
clear
looking
long
westward
i
could
gradually
distinguish
in
the
haze
of
the
distance
over
the
mountains
which
first
met
my
gaze
white
snowy
ranges
of
such
height
that
they
seemed
to
float
in
and
only
after
my
vision
had
acquired
sharpness
from
long
concentration
could
i
trace
their
outlines
basewards
but
it
was
the
sight
at
the
near
end
of
the
valley
which
most
claimed
my
attention
from
behind
the
green
hills
that
bound
it
rose
a
tall
chain
of
heights
whose
jagged
peaks
were
cleft
in
the
most
fantastic
fashion
and
fretted
and
worn
by
the
action
of
the
air
and
moisture
into
forms
some
bearing
the
semblance
of
delicate
gothic
spires
others
imitating
with
surprising
closeness
the
bolder
outlines
of
battlemented
buttresses
and
lofty
towers
the
bare
rock
which
formed
them
was
red
porphyry
and
the
morning
sun
glittering
on
it
lent
it
a
variety
of
bright
tints
purple
and
golden
which
were
thrown
into
striking
relief
by
the
blue
background
of
the
sky
and
the
white
masses
of
snow
which
in
parts
clung
to
the
peaks
the
abrupt
flanks
of
these
tall
heights
were
scored
with
deep
gullies
and
ravines
and
strewn
with
detached
boulders
of
rock
but
nowhere
was
there
any
trace
of
vegetation
either
bush
or
grass
the
suddenness
with
which
this
novel
scenery
burst
upon
me
considerably
heightened
its
effect
but
yesterday
we
had
stood
on
the
plains
with
their
eternal
monotony
of
colour
and
outline
last
night
we
had
gone
to
bed
as
we
thought
in
a
similar
dreary
waste
and
now
as
if
by
magic
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
a
grand
and
glorious
landscape
had
sprung
up
around
us
as
totally
different
in
its
diversity
of
outline
and
colour
from
that
which
only
a
few
hours
ago
had
depressed
and
wearied
us
as
could
well
be
imagined
it
was
amusing
to
hear
the
exclamations
of
surprise
with
which
my
companions
greeted
the
scene
as
one
by
one
they
came
out
of
their
tents
and
gazed
on
the
pleasant
metamorphosis
which
had
taken
place
during
our
slumbers
we
had
grumbled
a
good
deal
the
day
before
about
the
country
and
had
anathematised
it
with
many
expletives
but
all
that
was
now
forgotten
and
as
we
looked
around
us
we
felt
that
our
trouble
had
not
been
unrewarded
taking
advantage
of
the
fine
weather
we
spread
our
damp
furs
on
the
bushes
and
thanks
to
the
wind
and
sun
they
were
soon
dry
breakfast
over
my
brother
started
off
with
his
rifle
to
explore
the
peaks
at
the
end
of
the
valley
whilst
we
others
stretched
ourselves
on
our
furs
under
the
shade
of
some
tall
bushes
and
with
the
help
of
books
and
pipes
a
little
desultory
conversation
and
the
lazy
contemplation
of
the
fair
scenery
before
us
we
managed
to
pass
away
the
hot
hours
of
noon
pleasantly
enough
when
it
got
cooler
and
we
had
drank
our
fill
of
idleness
we
found
plenty
to
occupy
ourselves
with
there
were
guns
to
be
cleaned
i
had
my
journal
to
write
up
and
although
i
am
no
good
hand
with
the
needle
the
rough
usage
my
apparel
had
lately
received
made
some
attempts
at
sewing
and
patching
imperative
the
guides
busied
themselves
in
repairing
making
reins
or
lassos
from
guanaco
hide
and
similar
work
our
english
servant
storer
who
had
somehow
created
for
himself
the
reputation
of
one
expert
in
the
stuffing
of
birds
and
the
curing
of
skins
was
busy
with
several
unsavoury
smelling
specimens
of
the
latter
which
he
had
been
carrying
about
him
for
some
days
having
for
the
first
time
leisure
to
operate
upon
them
went
off
to
make
a
sketch
of
our
camp
and
its
picturesque
surroundings
and
in
searching
for
a
suitable
site
came
across
a
califaté
bush
the
blue
berries
on
which
were
almost
ripe
he
brought
back
a
capful
and
though
we
found
them
rather
acid
mashed
up
with
plenty
of
sugar
they
made
a
very
nice
refreshing
dish
which
was
especially
welcome
to
us
after
our
late
uniform
diet
in
the
long
grass
near
the
stream
that
flowed
down
the
valley
we
found
some
wild
celery
which
put
in
the
soup
was
a
decided
improvement
on
the
dried
julienne
we
had
brought
with
us
and
of
which
by
this
time
we
had
but
little
left
just
as
we
were
getting
rather
anxious
about
him
as
it
was
already
near
sunset
my
brother
came
back
from
his
excursion
to
the
porphyry
peaks
arriving
at
their
base
much
later
than
he
expected
having
been
deceived
in
the
distance
he
had
only
had
time
to
climb
about
up
them
but
even
at
that
height
had
got
a
splendid
view
of
the
country
beyond
his
accounts
of
which
made
us
eager
to
penetrate
into
it
as
soon
as
possible
but
as
our
packhorses
required
rest
this
had
to
be
deferred
for
a
couple
of
days
yet
the
next
day
a
was
organised
neither
our
guides
nor
ourselves
knowing
whether
any
game
was
to
be
found
in
the
country
we
were
about
to
enter
it
was
necessary
that
we
should
take
a
good
supply
of
meat
with
us
we
made
a
circle
in
the
usual
manner
and
were
successful
as
far
as
ostriches
were
concerned
inasmuch
as
after
some
good
runs
we
managed
to
kill
three
having
observed
a
herd
of
guanaco
grazing
in
a
valley
at
some
distance
those
of
us
whose
horses
were
still
tolerably
fresh
then
set
out
to
try
and
get
one
the
meat
of
three
ostriches
not
being
sufficient
to
last
ourselves
and
dogs
for
more
than
two
days
the
dogs
were
all
too
tired
with
their
previous
exertions
to
be
of
any
use
to
us
so
we
had
to
rely
solely
on
our
rifles
this
being
the
case
it
was
necessary
to
stalk
the
herd
with
great
precautions
and
this
we
proceeded
to
do
choosing
our
ground
carefully
so
as
to
keep
out
of
their
sight
but
we
had
not
gone
far
when
we
heard
a
shrill
neigh
close
by
and
looking
round
we
saw
a
guanaco
standing
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
valley
he
had
scarcely
uttered
his
cry
when
it
was
repeated
at
a
little
distance
off
by
another
watchful
sentinel
and
then
they
both
slowly
cantered
off
looking
back
at
us
as
they
went
along
and
neighing
loudly
at
intervals
the
herd
meanwhile
warned
of
the
approach
of
danger
leisurely
trotted
up
the
escarpment
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
and
as
leisurely
disappeared
over
the
plain
my
husband
took
a
vindictive
at
one
of
the
retreating
sentinels
but
missed
him
and
we
had
to
make
the
best
of
our
disappointment
and
search
for
some
less
watchful
herd
in
this
we
had
considerable
difficulty
the
guanacos
on
this
particular
day
appearing
to
be
shyer
than
we
had
ever
known
them
at
last
after
a
great
deal
of
fruitless
stalking
my
husband
got
a
shot
at
a
little
knot
of
four
or
five
who
were
standing
together
almost
out
of
range
one
fell
and
the
others
took
to
their
heels
with
a
cry
of
triumph
we
galloped
up
to
the
wounded
one
but
to
our
dismay
at
our
approach
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
started
off
full
speed
after
his
companions
to
all
appearance
unhurt
spurring
our
horses
we
followed
closely
in
his
wake
down
steep
ravines
up
hills
over
the
plains
at
times
losing
him
altogether
but
always
catching
sight
of
him
again
going
as
fresh
as
ever
till
at
last
we
began
to
despair
of
ever
running
him
down
one
by
one
my
companions
dropped
off
till
presently
only
my
husband
and
myself
were
left
in
the
chase
had
he
not
been
so
palpably
hit
we
should
have
desisted
too
but
it
seemed
a
pity
having
gone
so
far
to
give
in
so
we
kept
on
hoping
to
tire
out
our
prey
by
sheer
persistence
but
gradually
and
no
wonder
our
jaded
horses
began
to
show
signs
of
exhaustion
we
had
run
them
almost
to
a
standstill
and
reflecting
on
the
distance
we
had
to
ride
back
to
the
camp
we
were
just
going
to
rein
in
when
the
guanaco
suddenly
stopped
and
lay
down
sure
now
of
getting
him
we
pushed
on
towards
him
but
when
we
had
got
to
within
about
six
yards
of
him
up
he
got
and
galloped
off
again
distancing
us
at
every
stride
hesitating
what
to
do
we
kept
in
his
wake
though
all
the
time
we
were
wishing
we
had
never
started
after
him
slower
and
slower
our
panting
horses
struggled
towards
a
ravine
down
the
side
of
which
the
guanaco
had
disappeared
we
came
to
its
edge
and
looked
down
the
guanaco
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
we
were
at
a
loss
to
imagine
what
could
have
become
of
him
he
had
not
climbed
the
other
side
or
we
should
have
seen
him
emerge
on
the
plain
nor
could
he
have
gone
along
the
ravine
either
to
the
right
or
the
left
as
we
commanded
a
view
of
it
in
both
directions
for
a
long
distance
in
this
dilemma
we
were
staring
with
astonishment
about
us
when
something
moved
in
the
long
grass
below
and
directing
our
steps
thither
we
came
upon
our
guanaco
lying
stretched
out
in
a
pool
of
blood
the
movement
that
had
drawn
our
attention
to
him
had
evidently
been
his
last
effort
for
he
was
now
quite
dead
examining
him
we
found
the
bullet
had
entered
his
side
and
passing
through
the
lungs
and
lights
had
lodged
near
the
spine
and
yet
thus
severely
wounded
he
had
gone
quite
ten
miles
at
a
cracking
pace
later
on
we
experienced
still
more
extraordinary
instances
of
the
toughness
and
tenacity
of
life
of
these
animals
in
comparison
with
whom
the
cat
with
its
nine
lives
is
absolutely
nowhere
having
cut
up
the
guanaco
and
distributed
its
meat
on
the
saddles
of
our
horses
we
turned
back
towards
our
camp
and
a
long
ride
we
had
before
we
got
there
we
found
had
also
killed
a
guanaco
and
we
had
therefore
plenty
of
meat
to
last
us
should
we
have
difficulty
in
getting
game
in
the
cordilleras
the
next
day
was
passed
in
idleness
it
was
extremely
hot
scarcely
a
breath
of
wind
stirring
and
in
the
evening
we
were
rather
bothered
by
mosquitoes
this
being
the
first
acquaintance
we
made
with
them
in
patagonia
during
the
day
a
bird
was
seen
hovering
over
the
camp
at
an
immense
height
which
we
were
told
was
a
condor
it
was
so
high
up
that
it
looked
scarcely
bigger
than
an
ordinary
hawk
taking
advantage
of
a
moment
when
it
hung
perfectly
motionless
my
husband
had
a
shot
at
it
and
by
a
marvellous
fluke
the
ball
took
effect
and
down
the
creature
came
growing
bigger
and
bigger
as
it
fell
till
at
last
reaching
the
earth
with
a
loud
thud
there
it
was
the
most
gigantic
bird
i
had
ever
seen
we
found
it
measured
twelve
feet
from
wing
to
wing
the
most
distinctive
feature
of
the
condor
is
the
white
down
ruff
which
encircles
the
neck
two
or
three
inches
below
the
head
which
latter
is
completely
bare
of
feathers
and
repulsively
ugly
in
the
female
bird
the
colour
of
this
ruff
is
black
this
night
the
mosquitoes
became
a
positive
nuisance
i
tried
all
kinds
of
stratagems
to
protect
myself
from
them
such
as
tying
my
handkerchief
over
my
face
or
burying
myself
under
my
furs
but
between
being
smothered
and
bitten
i
preferred
the
latter
evil
similarly
the
plan
we
adopted
of
lighting
some
damp
grass
in
the
tent
so
as
to
smoke
our
trying
enemies
out
had
ultimately
to
be
abandoned
in
favour
of
passive
endurance
of
the
inevitable
i
quite
envied
old
throughout
the
night
whilst
from
all
sides
exclamations
and
expletives
of
varying
irritability
and
force
were
continually
to
be
heard
the
placid
snore
which
floated
from
his
tent
showed
that
thanks
to
his
parchment
skin
he
was
enabled
to
bear
the
sting
of
the
outrageous
mosquito
with
serene
indifference

we
were
up
early
the
next
morning
for
we
had
perhaps
a
long
journey
before
us
the
country
we
were
about
to
penetrate
being
as
unknown
to
our
guides
as
to
ourselves
and
no
one
could
say
when
and
where
we
might
find
a
suitable
place
for
camping
that
night
all
helped
to
drive
up
and
saddle
the
horses
their
long
rest
and
the
rich
grass
in
the
valley
had
done
them
good
and
they
were
in
very
fair
condition
which
was
fortunate
as
we
might
have
some
arduous
climbs
to
face
and
pasture
lands
might
be
scarce

entrance
to
the
cordilleras
the
day
before
the
guides
had
been
on
a
reconnoitring
expedition
with
the
object
of
finding
the
most
practicable
route
towards
the
interior
and
having
discovered
a
ravine
which
appeared
to
wind
in
the
direction
of
the
mountains
and
which
at
the
same
time
afforded
easy
going
for
our
horses
we
resolved
to
make
it
our
highway
accordingly
all
being
ready
we
said
to
the
plains
and
fording
the
stream
which
flowed
down
the
valley
we
entered
on
the
winding
ravine
full
of
curiosity
as
to
what
kind
of
country
we
were
now
to
break
in
upon
the
ravine
was
in
itself
a
fit
preparation
for
something
strange
and
grand
its
steep
slopes
towered
up
on
either
side
of
us
to
an
immense
height
and
the
sunlight
being
thus
partially
excluded
a
mysterious
gloom
reigned
below
which
combined
with
the
intense
almost
painful
silence
of
the
spot
made
the
scene
inexpressibly
strange
and
impressive
its
effect
was
intensified
by
the
knowledge
that
since
these
gigantic
solitudes
had
been
fashioned
by
nature
no
human
eye
had
ever
beheld
them
nor
had
any
human
voice
ever
raised
the
echoes
which
awakening
now
for
the
first
time
repeated
in
sonorous
chorus
the
profane
shouts
of
iegua
iegua
with
which
our
guides
drove
the
horses
along
we
hurried
on
anxious
to
reach
the
mouth
of
the
ravine
and
behold
the
promised
land
as
soon
as
possible
but
several
hours
elapsed
before
we
at
last
reached
its
farther
end
and
emerged
from
its
comparative
gloom
into
the
sunshine
of
the
open
a
glance
showed
us
that
we
were
in
a
new
country
before
us
stretched
a
picturesque
plain
covered
with
soft
green
turf
and
dotted
here
and
there
with
clumps
of
beeches
and
crossed
in
all
directions
by
rippling
streams
the
background
was
formed
by
hills
behind
which
again
towered
the
cordilleras
three
tall
peaks
of
a
reddish
hue
and

exact
facsimiles
of
cleopatra
needle
being
a
conspicuous
feature
in
the
landscape
the
califaté
bushes
here
were
of
a
size
we
had
never
met
on
the
plains
and
were
covered
with
ripe
berries
on
which
hosts
of
small
birds
were
greedily
feasting
the
very
air
seemed
balmier
and
softer
than
that
we
had
been
accustomed
to
and
instead
of
the
rough
winds
we
had
hitherto
encountered
there
was
a
gentle
breeze
of
just
sufficient
strength
agreeably
to
temper
the
heat
of
the
sun
here
and
there
guanaco
were
grazing
under
the
shade
of
a
spreading
beech
tree
and
by
the
indolent
manner
in
which
they
walked
away
as
we
approached
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
have
a
dozen
fierce
dogs
and
shouting
horsemen
at
their
heels
but
soon
we
all
dismounted
round
a
huge
califaté
bush
and
there
we
ate
our
fill
of
its
sweet
juicy
berries
taking
a
supply
with
us
to
be
eaten
after
dinner
mashed
up
with
sugar
as
dessert
then
we
gaily
cantered
on
towards
the
hills
passing
many
a
nook
and
enjoying
many
a
charming
glimpse
of
landscape
doubly
delightful
after
the
ugliness
of
the
plains
numerous
small
lagoons
covered
with
of
strange
and
novel
appearance
frequently
came
in
our
way
and
by
their
shores
basked
hundreds
of
the
lovely
white
swans
whose
species
i
have
already
mentioned
unlike
their
comrades
of
the
plains
they
appeared
perfectly
tame
merely
waddling
into
the
water
when
we
approached
close
up
alongside
them
and
never
once
attempting
to
fly
away
i
was
greatly
struck
by
the
thousands
of
ducks
and
geese
that
covered
these
lakes
crossing
a
broad
which
ran
down
from
the
hills
on
our
left
and
disappeared
into
a
mighty
gorge
stretching
away
into
those
on
our
right
we
still
directed
our
march
along
the
grassy
plain
which
led
direct
towards
the
three
huge
cleopatra
peaks
rising
from
out
of
the
snow
glaciers
far
ahead
of
us
the
slopes
which
we
could
perceive
in
the
distance
filled
us
with
eager
longing
to
reach
them
as
it
was
many
a
day
since
we
had
last
seen
trees
of
any
kind
in
the
vast
forests
which
lay
before
us
we
promised
ourselves
a
goodly
supply
of
fuel
and
many
a
roaring
fire
around
the
camp
on
the
way
we
occasionally
gave
chase
to
the
foxes
which
started
up
at
our
approach
there
are
a
great
many
of
these
animals
in
patagonia
and
one
has
to
be
careful
to
put
all
leather
articles
in
some
safe
place
at
night
or
else
in
the
morning
one
is
apt
to
find
them
gnawed
to
pieces
by
these
sly
marauders
their
fur
is
very
soft
and
silver
gray
in
colour
i
resolved
to
make
a
collection
of
their
skins
and
carry
them
back
to
england
to
be
made
up
into
rugs
and
other
useful
articles
it
is
very
rarely
that
a
dog
can
catch
one
of
these
foxes
by
himself
our
best
ostrich
hound
la
plata
after
an
exciting
chase
of
half
an
hour
found
himself
outpaced
and
outstayed
so
quickly
can
they
twist
turn
and
double
that
it
is
out
of
the
power
of
one
dog
to
equal

illustration
the
cleopatra
needles
whilst
we
were
slowly
jogging
along
my
horse
with
a
snort
of
terror
suddenly
swerved
violently
on
one
side
close
to
him
there
rose
up
a
magnificent
ostrich
who
after
one
astonished
gaze
at
our
party
turned
and
fled
in
the
direction
by
which
we
had
just
come
with
a
merry
shout
françois
was
after
him
followed
by
my
brother
and
myself
loca
and
leona
who
had
caught
sight
of
the
ostrich
in
a
moment
lost
no
time
in
straining
every
limb
to
come
alongside
the
bird
who
scudded
away
at
a
tremendous
pace
over
the
rough
uneven
ground
our
progress
on
horseback
was
also
by
no
means
an
easy
task
as
the
line
taken
by
the
ostrich
presented
many
obstacles
such
as
high
thick
bushes
rocks
and
broad
deep
chasms
these
latter
obstacles
could
only
be
negotiated
at
certain
places
as
their
sides
were
jagged
and
rotten
and
woe
betide
the
horse
who
should
fall
into
one
of
these
deep
bottoms
but
when
his
blood
is
up
and
the
excitement
of
the
chase
at
its
highest
pitch
what
keen
sportsman
cares
to
crane
or
wonder
what
danger
lies
on
the
other
side
of
the
obstacle
that
confronts
him
his
only
thought
is
to
get
forward
and
keep
a
front
rank
in
the
merry
chase
that
goes
gaily
sweeping
along
and
so
on
we
pressed
as
fast
as
we
could
and
urged
our
horses
to
do
their
utmost
fully
entering
into
the
excitement
of
the
moment
the
game
little
beasts
answered
willingly
to
our
call
and
in
spite
of
the
rough
difficult
going
we
managed
to
keep
the
dogs
and
ostrich
in
sight

soon
have

shakes
her
head
to
get
rid
of
those
that
cling
round
her

the
bird
has
begun
to
double
but
finds
his
match
in
the
two
clever
little
ladies
at
his
side
and
before
long
succumbs
an
easy
prey
to
them
both
this
little
incident
lent
a
pleasant
variety
to
the
winding
up
of
a
long
tiring
day
and
full
of
triumph
in
the
success
of
our
hunt
we
trotted
towards
the
our
companions
had
chosen
illustration
encampment
in
the
cordilleras
on
our
arrival
we
found
active
preparations
going
on
in
the
culinary
department
and
every
one
very
busily
engaged
three
huge
fires
blazed
merrily
in
front
of
my
tent
and
a
little
farther
off
a
succession
of
smaller
ones
indicated
the
spot
where
the
cooks
were
employed
in
preparing
dinner
over
one
of
these
hung
a
pot
of
soup
carefully
superintended
by
my
husband

another

was
watching
and
turning
the
roasting
ribs
of
a
guanaco
while
at
a
third
gregorio
occupied
himself
in
frying
a
rich
steak
of
ostrich
and
roasting
three
or
four
of
their
wings
as
a
which
was
to
succeed
the
roast
nor
were
guillaume
or
idle
as
the
goodly
pile
of
firewood
that
lay
stacked
up
near
each
fire
spoke
volumes
for
their
activity
and
energy
after
we
had
unsaddled
our
horses
and
turned
them
loose
to
join
their
companions
hard
by
we
refreshed
ourselves
with
maté
and
then
proceeded
to
take
part
in
the
general
work
and
arrangement
of
the
camp
mysteriously
promising
us
something
extra
good
in
the
shape
of
a
new
dish
françois
retired
into
his
tent
dragging
after
him
the
ostrich
which
we
had
just
killed
the
result
of
his
efforts
he
assured
us
would
produce
a
pleasant
surprise
and
an
agreeable
change
in
the
monotony
of
our
daily
diet
though
full
of
curiosity
as
to
what
that
result
might
prove
we
judged
it
best
to
leave
him
alone
remembering
the
proverb
that
too
many
cooks
spoil
a
dish
collecting
the
rows
of
and
articles
of
riding
gear
i
proceeded
to
arrange
them
tidily
together
with
the
numerous
sacks
and
baggage
in
a
corner
of
storer
tent
and
then
gathering
up
a
roll
of
guanaco
furs
turned
my
attention
to
the
making
up
of
our
beds
on
the
pampa
it
had
always
been
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
to
discover
ground
smooth
enough
whereon
to
lay
out
the
beds
on
account
of
the
rough
uneven
nature
of
the
plains
but
on
this
occasion
i
had
no
cause
to
grumble
for
beneath
the
lofty
spreading
beech
trees
the
smooth
velvety
mossy
turf
afforded
the
softest
and
most
luxurious
of
feather
beds
in
the
world
our
couches
were
simple
enough
as
doubtless
the
reader
imagines
the
ground
supplied
the
want
of
a
bedstead
or
mattress
a
single
blanket
occupied
the
place
of
a
sheet
and
our
guanaco
capas
served
as
covering
being
remarkable
for
their
great
warmth
with
our
saddles
for
our
pillows
a
complete
and
final
touch
was
given
to
the
whole
arrangement
and
on
these
hard
beds
tired
with
our
day
exertions
we
would
sleep
as
soundly
and
comfortably
as
though
they
were
the
most
luxurious
spring
mattresses
imaginable
the
beds
arranged
to
my
satisfaction
i
next
proceeded
to
go
the
round
of
the
camp
to
see
if
everything
was
in
order
on
finding
which
to
be
the
case
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
felt
that
my
work
was
over
for
the
day
and
the
time
for
rest
arrived
roughing
it
may
be
all
very
well
in
theory
but
it
is
not
so
easy
in
practice
after
a
long
tiring
march
when
you
have
been
in
the
saddle
twelve
or
thirteen
hours
under
a
hot
sun
it
is
by
no
means
a
light
task
on
the
arrival
at
your
journey
end
to
have
to
unload
your
horses
pitch
your
tents
cook
your
dinner
clean
your
saddles
and
bridles
unpack
and
remove
the
baggage
and
place
everything
in
order
and
neatness
while
it
occupies
a
long
and
weary
time
in
england
on
your
return
every
day
from
hunting
you
come
home
tired
and
weary
no
doubt
but
it
is
to
a
cosy
where
a
warm
room
a
blazing
fire
an
easy
await
you
with
servants
in
plenty
to
attend
to
your
wants
a
refreshing
hot
bath
and
the
luxury
of
a
clean
change
of
clothes
but
all
this
is
not
forthcoming
on
the
pampa
and
before
you
can
rest
the
whole
business
i
have
mentioned
has
to
be
gone
through
everybody
no
matter
who
it
is
taking
his
or
her
share
of
work
while
the
thought
of
fatigue
must
be
banished
and
every
one
must
put
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
and
undertake
and
accomplish
his
separate
task
cheerfully
and
willingly
only
by
so
doing
can
things
be
kept
going
in
the
brisk
orderly
manner
they
should
our
camp
had
been
pitched
close
to
the
bank
of
a
lovely
little
mountain
stream
which
made
its
appearance
from
out
the
thick
woods
that
rose
to
a
great
height
behind
us
the
sound
of
its
splashing
waters
filled
me
with
an
irresistible
longing
for
a
plunge
accordingly
armed
with
a
rough
towel
i
proceeded
to
follow
its
winding
course
upwards
and
through
the
dense
foliage
of
the
beech
trees
i
could
make
out
its
silver
stream
descending
like
a
white
streak
from
an
immense
height
presently
i
arrived
at
a
spot
where
fed
by
a
small
cascade
a
clear
cool
pool
of
water
presented
a
most
convenient
and
inviting
appearance
for
a
bath
i
lost
no
time
in
undressing
and
indulging
in
the
luxury
of
a
plunge
which
greatly
refreshed
and
invigorated
me
after
the
long
tiring
day
i
had
undergone
on
my
return
to
the
camp
i
found
that
dinner
was
quite
ready
nine
hungry
human
beings
and
nine
still
hungrier
dogs
require
a
good
substantial
meal
our
that
night
was
neither
mean
nor
small
as
it
may
interest

the
proved
to

the

about
which
françois
had
observed
so
much
secrecy
and
mystery
it
was
certainly
exceedingly
good
and
we
were
loud
in
praise
of
its
merits
the
ostrich
liver
and
fat
a
new
dish
also
was
most
acceptable
and
that
night
we
drank
the
health
of
françois
in
a
glass
of
whisky
and
water
all
round
dinner
over
we
replenished
the
numerous
fires
that
burned
in
a
semicircle
in
front
of
our
camp
and
then
tired
and
weary
we
sought
our
couches
and
canopied
by
the
rustling
trees
with
the
bright
moonlight
shining
down
upon
us
slept
as
sound
and
contented
a
sleep
as
the
fatigues
we
had
undergone
entitled
us
to

tracks
deer
man
the
destroyer
the
first
few
days
of
our
sojourn
in
the
mountains
were
spent
in
making
short
excursions
into
the
different
gorges
that
stretched
away
inwards
for
miles
and
miles
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
we
were
full
of
curiosity
to
penetrate
and
fathom
their
hidden
mysteries
but
this
was
out
of
the
question
owing
to
the
limited
supply
of
provisions
which
we
were
able
to
carry
with
us
in
these
solitary
wanderings
we
came
across
no
sign
or
vestige
of
the
haunts
of
human
beings
and
few
and
far
between
were
the
animals
that
crossed
our
path
occasionally
from
some
jagged
plateau
or
rugged
height
we
would
catch
a
glimpse
of
small
deer
or
guanaco
and
now
and
again
a
wild
horse
would
peer
at
us
suspiciously
from
behind
a
huge
rock
and
then
with
a
neigh
of
astonishment
rather
than
fright
dash
hurriedly
off
its
beautiful
mane
and
tail
flowing
in
the
breeze
giving
it
a
grand
wild
and
picturesque
appearance
musters
tells
us
in
his
of
that
the
indians
fully
believe
in
the
existence
of
an
unknown
tribe
or
of
an
enchanted
or
hidden
city
which
they
superstitiously
aver
lies
concealed
somewhere
in
the
recesses
of
these
mountains
farther
north
the
araucanian
indians
profess
to
having
discovered
in
their
vicinity
a
settlement
of
white
people
who
spoke
an
unknown
tongue
numerous
legends
and
stories
are
current
amongst
the
patagonians
who
all
behold
with
awe
and
superstition
the
distant
wooded
slopes
and
glaciers
of
the
cordilleras
into
whose
shades
they
never
attempt
to
penetrate
the
chilotes
declare
that
in
the
western
forests
of
the
cordillera
an
animal
exists
bearing
the
form
of
a
wild
man
covered
all
over
with
coarse
shaggy
hair
tranco
is
the
appellation
by
which
it
goes
it
is
difficult
to
bring
oneself
to
believe
that
amidst
these
immense
solitudes
a
species
of
human
being
does
not
exist
imaginative
minds
may
conjure
up
all
sorts
of
extraordinary
fancies
and
people
unknown
regions
with
strange
and
fantastic
figures
and
it
is
hard
to
prevent
oneself
from
giving
a
kind
of
credence
to
these
vague
stories
which
are
told
with
so
much
confidence
and
belief
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
the
hilly
undulating
country
which
stretched
away
in
the
direction
of
the
three
cleopatra
peaks
filled
us
with
an
eager
desire
to
explore
its
unknown
territory
and
accordingly
accompanied
by
gregorio
and
françois
we
all
set
off
on
horseback
early
one
morning
soon
after
daybreak
the
air
was
keen
and
invigorating
and
we
trotted
along
for
some
time
following
and
skirting
the
line
of
forest
which
extended
on
our
right
and
in
front
of
us
as
far
as
we
could
distinguish
away
on
our
left
stretched
a
bright
green
valley
gay
with
flowers
and
watered
by
innumerable
streams
and
whilst
beyond
rose
high
hills
covered
with
vegetation
and
crowned
in
the
distance
by
thick
impenetrable
woods
califaté
bushes
loaded
with
ripe
berries
of
a
great
and
unusual
size
frequently
brought
us
to
a
halt
as
it
was
impossible
to
resist
their
tempting
and
refreshing
aspect
about
midday
when
the
sun
was
at
its
height
and
we
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
its
hot
scorching
rays
the
valley
through
which
we
had
been
pursuing
our
way
suddenly
came
to
an
abrupt
termination
breasting
the
hill
which
confined
its
limits
we
halted
on
the
summit
to
give
the
horses
a
few
moments
rest
and
to
contemplate
in
silence
and
delight
the
lovely
scene
that
lay
stretched
at
our
feet
of
a
totally
different
aspect
was
this
new
country
on
which
we
were
entering
from
that
we
had
just
quitted
for
the
woods
closed
in
on
all
sides
and
huge
masses
of
rocks
rose
from
out
their
leafy
tops
giving
the
appearance
of
ruined
strongholds
to
those
who
beheld
them
for
the
first
time
sunny
glades
carpeted
by
rich
green
grass
opened
out
here
and
there
as
though
they
had
been
cleared
and
fashioned
by
the
hand
of
man
while
a
lovely
little
stream
which
made
its
appearance
from
out
of
the
woods
on
our
right
continued
its
course
towards
a
deep
ravine
which
we
could
distinguish
in
the
distance
away
to
our
left
and
surrounded
by
thick
woods
glittered
the
clear
sparkling
waters
of
an
immense
lake
which
we
judged
to
be
about
two
miles
distant
and
beyond
all
rose
up
like
a
huge
frowning
barrier
the
lofty
peaks
of
the
cordillera
not
a
sound
disturbed
the
deathlike
stillness
which
reigned
over
everything
no
animal
life
was
stirring
and
the
impression
conveyed
to
an
who
beheld
this
scene
for
the
first
time
was
a
sense
of
utter
loneliness
and
desolation
descending
the
hill
on
which
we
had
halted
to
breathe
the
horses
we
entered
upon
the
woodland
scene
i
have
just
described
and
following
the
course
of
the
little
brook
that
flowed
towards
the
great
ravine
were
not
long
in
arriving
at
the
edge
of
its
steep
perpendicular
descent
it
proved
to
be
a
ravine
of
no
ordinary
size
for
many
hundreds
of
feet
below
its
base
was
formed
by
what
appeared
to
be
a
tiny
winding
stream
but
which
a
later
expedition
of
which
i
have
yet
to
speak
proved
in
reality
to
be
a
broad
though
shallow
river
far
away
below
us
to
our
right
roared
an
enormous
cataract
which
half
hidden
in
the
trees
left
scarcely
any
part
of
itself
visible
and
were
it
not
for
the
clouds
of
spray
that
rose
to
a
great
height
an
could
not
have
distinguished
its
real
position
amidst
its
leafy
illustration
the
glen
we
were
not
long
in
ascertaining
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
horses
down
the
steep
precipitous
sides
of
this
great
ravine
and
therefore
reluctantly
abandoned
any
hope
of
being
able
that
day
to
make
any
farther
progress
towards
the
three
great
peaks
which
still
towered
in
front
of
us
directing
our
horses
to
the
left
we
entered
a
long
stretch
of
narrow
woodland
which
appeared
to
lead
in
the
direction
of
the
lake
we
had
distinguished
a
little
time
back
it
was
not
long
before
we
struck
upon
a
wild
horse
track
and
concluding
that
it
was
formed
by
these
animals
on
their
way
to
drink
at
the
lake
we
followed
its
tortuous
and
many
winding
ways
for
some
time
frequently
the
brushwood
became
so
dense
the
trees
so
close
together
that
we
had
to
dismount
and
creep
through
the
openings
made
by
our
horses
having
previously
driven
them
through
now
and
then
the
path
we
were
following
would
suddenly
cease
and
it
would
be
some
time
before
we
came
upon
its
track
again
at
last
we
emerged
from
some
thick
underwood
into
a
broad
clearing
and
eagerly
pushed
forward
proceeding
at
a
quicker
rate
than
my
companions
i
was
soon
far
ahead
of
them
and
in
fear
of
being
lost
and
anxious
to
avoid
such
an
unpleasant
i
drew
rein
and
dismounting
sat
down
to
await
their
arrival
presently
a
cracking
sound
as
of
sticks
breaking
close
to
me
attracted
my
attention
looking
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
proceeded
i
espied
a
species
of
deer
of
a
dark
golden
colour
eyeing
me
with
extreme
astonishment
he
was
a
fine
buck
with
beautiful
branching
antlers
and
large
dark
languishing
eyes
close
behind
him
cautiously
peered
two
does
and
a
little
farther
off
i
could
make
out
several
other
animals
of
the
same
kind
how
i
longed
for
a
rifle
but
of
this
firearm
i
knew
we
had
not
brought
one
with
us
and
though
i
had
a
gun
it
was
not
at
hand
and
was
being
carried
by
storer
crawling
away
from
the
spot
as
quietly
as
i
could
i
placed
a
good
hundred
yards
between
myself
and
the
place
from
which
i
had
first
caught
sight
of
these
animals
and
then
springing
to
my
feet
ran
as
hard
as
i
could
in
the
direction
i
judged
my
companions
were
coming
as
soon
as
they
came
in
sight
i
endeavoured
by
signs
to
get
them
to
halt
they
quickly
perceived
me
and
guessing
what
i
wanted
immediately
drew
rein
and
waited
for
me
to
come
up
i
lost
no
time
in
informing
them
of
the
discovery
i
had
made
and
taking
my
gun
proceeded
to
regain
as
quietly
and
stealthily
as
possible
the
spot
i
had
lately
quitted
the
rest
of
my
companions
remained
stationary
waiting
for
the
report
of
my
gun
which
was
to
bring
them
all
up
yes
there
he
was
a
beautiful
animal
still
in
the
same
attitude
of
inquiring
curiosity
in
which
i
had
left
him
anxious
to
avoid
spoiling
the
head
i
took
aim
behind
the
shoulder
and
fired
the
report
was
followed
by
a
crashing
sound
in
the
direction
in
which
i
had
fired
into
the
glade
some
deer
bounded
and
like
lightning
disappeared
into
the
opposite
wood
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
i
perceived
the
one
at
which
i
had
fired
on
his
knees
evidently
unable
to
proceed
full
of
anxiety
to
place
the
poor
beast
out
of
his
agony
i
fired
a
second
barrel
at
him
which
had
the
effect
of
knocking
him
over
springing
up
immediately
however
he
walked
slowly
away
seemingly
unconcerned
and
unhurt
i
could
not
make
out
what
was
the
matter
with
myself
and
my
gun
he
had
evidently
been
hit
both
times
and
yet
seemed
to
be
perfectly
unconcerned
at
the
whole
thing
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
fire
again
but
gregorio
did
with
his
revolver
and
broke
the
unfortunate
animals
leg
limping
away
on
three
he
went
and
lay
down
under
an
overhanging
rock
appearing
more
stupefied
than
in
pain
disgusted
at
such
butchery
i
begged
one
of
my
companions
all
of
whom
had
come
up
to
despatch
the
unfortunate
beast
and
my
husband
going
close
up
to
him
placed
his
revolver
within
a
foot
of
the
deer
forehead
and
fired
slowly
it
sank
forward
stunned
and
apparently
lifeless
but
when
we
came
alongside
it
it
was
still
breathing
and
there
was
no
mark
to
show
that
the
bullet
had
penetrated
the
skull
here
françois
came
to
our
aid
and
with
the
help
of
his
the
poor
creature
was
put
out
of
his
misery
as
i
wished
to
keep
the
skin
the
coat
of
which
was
very
thick
and
long
gregorio
set
to
work
to
remove
it
the
process
occupied
some
time
and
proved
most
difficult
and
tedious
to
accomplish
during
our
stay
in
the
cordilleras
we
frequently
came
across
these
deer
but
our
experience
of
their
tameness
the
great
difficulty
of
killing
them
and
the
utter
absence
of
sport
which
lay
therein
prevented
us
from
ever
again
attempting
to
bring
another
down
the
flesh
was
decidedly
good
and
much
to
be
appreciated
after
the
monotonous
diet
of
ostrich
and
guanaco
meat
but
even
with
this
inducement
at
hand
the
golden
deer
of
the
cordilleras
remained
unmolested
and
sacred
in
our
eyes
for
the
rest
of
the
time
we
remained
in
their
hitherto
undisturbed
and
peaceful
solitudes
if
regret
could
atone
for
that
death
of
which
i
unfortunately
was
the
cause
then
it
has
long
ago
been
forgiven
for
for
many
a
day
i
was
haunted
by
a
sad
remorse
for
the
loss
of
that
innocent
and
trusting
life
which
had
hitherto
remained
in
ignorance
of
the
annihilating
propensities
of
man
that
man
who
directly
he
sees
something
beautiful
and
rare
becomes
filled
with
the
desire
to
destroy
the
shoulders
ribs
and
head
were
packed
on
to
the
horses
of
storer
françois
and
gregorio
the
remainder
being
left
as
food
for
the
dogs
and
condors
some
dozen
of
the
latter
having
scented
blood
were
already
hovering
high
above
our
heads
and
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
sight
would
doubtless
swoop
down
and
make
greedy
feast
on
the
remains
left
by
the
dogs
five
minutes
riding
brought
us
to
the
shores
of
the
great
lagoon
towards
which
we
had
been
directing
our
steps
here
we
dismounted
and
tethering
our
horses
left
them
to
browse
on
the
long
rich
grass
which
grew
luxuriantly
and
thickly
all
round
a
couple
of
hours
were
quickly
and
happily
whiled
away
duck
shooting
it
was
not
till
late
that
night
that
we
reached
our
camp
in
safety
tired
and
hungry
but
having
thoroughly
enjoyed
our
day
chapter

an
alarm
the
an
equine
combat
the
wild
stallion
victorious
the
struggle
renewed
retreat
of
the
wild
horses
one
evening
after
dinner
we
were
all
sitting
round
the
discussing
coffee
when
who
had
gone
to
have
a
last
look
at
the
horses
before
turning
in
came
running
back
and
announced
that
he
could
see
the
indians
coming
down
the
valley
in
great
numbers
we
immediately
jumped
up
and
hurried
out
to
inspect
the
new
arrivals
not
a
little
annoyed
at
the
prospect
of
our
privacy
being
intruded
upon
by
these
unwelcome
guests
looking
up
the
valley
we
saw
a
dark
mass
moving
slowly
towards
us
presently
it
came
nearer
and
gregorio
looking
at
it
closely
for
a
moment
said
excitedly
that
not
the
indians
but
a
herd
of
wild
horses
we
had
better
look
out
for
our
own
an
extraordinary
commotion
was
indeed
visible
among
our
animals
they
were
running
to
and
fro
evidently
in
a
state
of
great
perturbation
now
collecting
together
in
a
knot
now
dispersing
at
a
gallop
over
the
valley
neighing
and
whinnying
shrilly
as
gregorio
spoke
one
of
the
wild
horses
detached
itself
from
the
main
troop
and
galloped
at
full
speed
towards
our
horses
quick
quick
your
rifles
or
we
shall
lose
our
tropilla
shouted
gregorio
in
evident
alarm
and
though
we
did
not
quite
understand
the
full
extent
of
our
danger
we
ran
for
our
rifles
and
started
off
as
quick
as
we
could
to
get
between
the
wild
horses
and
our
own
gregorio
explaining
as
we
ran
along
that
the
wild
stallion
if
we
did
not
stop
him
would
drive
off
our
troop
and
leave
us
in
the
most
perilous
plight
of
course
nothing
more
was
needed
to
urge
us
on
to
our
utmost
speed
to
avert
the
threatening
danger
but
the
stallion
flew
like
the
wind
towards
our
horses
who
were
now
all
huddled
together
in
a
corner
of
the
valley
and
we
could
scarcely
hope
to
be
in
time
to
save
them
suddenly
he
staggered
and
fell
he
had
got
into
a
bog
in
the
few
seconds
he
lost
in
extricating
himself
we
had
time
to
get
within
range
bang
bang
bang
went
our
rifles
but
unscathed
he
sped
on
and
was
soon
within
twenty
yards
of
our
terrified
animals
and
far
in
front
of
us
we
are
lost
cried
the
guides
simultaneously
and
filled
with
dismay
we
all
stood
still
perfectly
paralysed
at
the
thought
of
the
position
we
should
be
in
without
horses
three
hundred
miles
away
from
sandy
point
but
at
this
moment
gregorio
big
bay
stallion
the
master
of
the
troop
rushed
out
to
meet
the
enemy
both
halting
when
they
met
and
fronting
one
another
thankful
for
this
diversion
in
our
favour
we
again
ran
forward
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
get
up
before
stallion
should
have
been
compelled
to
fly
as
the
superior
size
of
his
adversary
left
no
doubt
he
would
ultimately
have
to
do
in
the
meantime
the
two
animals
after
pawing
the
air
for
a
second
or
two
made
a
dash
at
one
another
and
engaged
in
a
fierce
combat
carried
on
chiefly
with
their
teeth
though
occasionally
they
would
rise
on
their
hind
legs
and
fight
with
their
fore
feet
our
horses
not
daring
to
stir
watched
them
on
one
side
and
the
wild
herd
which
had
meanwhile
trotted
up
close
to
the
field
of
battle
looked
on
from
the
other
side
apparently
deeply
interested
in
the
issue
of
the
struggle
we
hurried
along
as
quick
as
we
could
though
unfortunately
we
could
make
but
slow
progress
encumbered
as
we
were
with
our
rifles
and
retarded
by
the
long
grass
meanwhile
another
misfortune
we
discovered
that
beyond
three
bullets
my
husband
happened
to
have
had
in
his
pocket
when
we
started
and
which
we
had
fired
off
in
the
first
volley
no
one
had
brought
any
ammunition
this
essential
having
been
overlooked
in
the
hurry
and
excitement
of
the
moment
hoping
we
should
be
able
to
cope
with
the
stallion
should
we
get
up
in
time
with
our
revolvers
we
pressed
on
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
two
combatants
the
endurance
of
our
champion
being
now
our
only
chance
he
was
evidently
already
worsted
and
any
second
might
turn
tail
and
fly
still
he
fought
on
and
still
we
drew
nearer
and
nearer
suddenly
my
brother
who
was
a
little
in
front
of
us
seemed
to
fall
running
to
him
we
found
him
up
to
the
waist
in
a
bog
which
stretched
up
the
valley
between
us
and
the
horses
it
was
impossible
to
cross
it
indeed
we
had
some
difficulty
in
pulling
him
out
we
had
to
run
a
good
distance
before
we
could
get
on
to
firmer
ground
and
in
the
meantime
the
battle
went
against
our
stallion
who
suddenly
turned
tail
and
fled
after
giving
him
a
parting
kick
the
wild
horse
rushed
at
our
troop
and
began
to
drive
them
at
a
gallop
towards
his
own
punishing
with
vicious
bites
and
kicks
any
animal
that
showed
signs
of
becoming
refractory
or
that
did
not
go
quick
enough
the
moment
was
critical
we
strained
every
nerve
to
get
between
the
two
troops
as
if
they
once
joined
our
chances
were
hopeless
but
for
another
unexpected
diversion
in
our
favour
our
efforts
would
have
been
defeated
this
diversion
was
the
sudden
reappearance
on
the
scene
of
our
stallion
who
at
the
sight
of
his
retreating
wives
had
evidently
once
more
screwed
up
his
courage
to
the
fighting
point
the
combat
that
now
ensued
was
fiercer
even
than
the
last
one
profiting
by
it
we
got
up
to
our
horses
who
had
stood
still
again
and
hurriedly
drove
them
in
front
of
us
towards
our
camp
we
had
gone
some
distance
when
the
wild
stallion
having
again
proved
victor
came
swooping
after
us
neighing
proudly
and
evidently
meaning
mischief
we
began
to
shout
and
wave
our
hands
as
he
approached
in
the
hopes
of
driving
him
off
when
within
forty
yards
of
us
he
stopped
but
continued
to
circle
round
us
stamping
and
pawing
and
neighing
angrily
our
object
was
to
drive
the
horses
up
to
the
camp
and
get
to
our
rifle
ammunition
it
being
evident
that
the
only
way
to
relieve
ourselves
of
this
troublesome
don
juan
was
by
despatching
him
altogether
we
soon
got
near
to
the
camp
and
shouted
to
to
bring
us
some
bullets
at
the
report
of
the
first
shot
the
stallion
fled
in
dismay
and
with
such
rapidity
that
the
two
or
three
bangs
we
had
at
him
missed
their
mark
he
made
straight
for
his
own
troop
who
during
the
whole
performance
had
stood
in
watchful
expectation
the
moment
he
reached
them
they
all
started
off
at
a
gallop
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
swept
up
the
steep
escarpment
on
the
far
side
of
the
valley
and
disappeared
our
horses
were
so
frightened
and
bewildered
by
the
day
events
that
they
seemed
to
have
little
desire
to
graze
but
stood
quite
quiet
together
for
upwards
of
an
hour
near
the
camp
we
were
in
some
apprehension
lest
the
stallion
should
return
in
the
night
but
gregorio
said
that
he
thought
there
was
no
danger
of
such
an
occurrence
taking
place
and
we
accordingly
turned
in
and
went
to
sleep
and
were
glad
to
see
our
troop
grazing
tranquilly

morning

coffee
and
meat
being
all
we
contemplated
carrying
with
us
except
of
course
our
guanaco
furs
and
guns
thus
equipped
we
started
the
next
morning
shortly
after
sunrise
our
trip
began
badly
we
had
not
gone
far
before
my
brother
got
into
a
morass
out
of
which
he
had
no
little
difficulty
in
extricating
himself
and
as
for
his
horse
at
one
time
we
thought
the
poor
brute
would
never
get
out
again
so
deep
had
it
sunk
into
the
trembling
boggy
ground
however
we
managed
to
get
it
out
at
last
and
though
both
well
plastered
with
mud
neither
its
rider
nor
itself
were
any
the
worse
for
this
little
proceeding
on
our
journey
we
followed
gregorio
at
a
merry
trot
towards
the
great
ravine
through
which
flowed
that
broad
and
rapid
mountain
stream
which
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
ford
the
ravine
side
was
so
steep
that
we
had
to
dismount
and
lead
our
horses
down
by
a
narrow
track
made
by
the
wild
horses
this
pathway
seemed
to
fall
almost
perpendicularly
down
to
the
river
which
roared
along
two
or
three
hundred
feet
below
us
and
a
slip
or
stumble
might
have
sent
us
pell
mell
one
over
the
other
into
it
no
such
mishap
occurred
however
and
safely
reaching
the
bottom
we
proceeded
to
ford
the
river
it
was
not
so
deep
as
we
had
expected
but
it
ran
with
great
force
and
its
bed
being
composed
of
shifting
pebbles
and
large
boulders
of
rock
our
horses
floundered
and
splashed
about
in
a
distressing
way
and
we
all
got
more
or
less
drenched
by
the
time
we
got
through
it
this
being
the
summer
season
the
water
was
comparatively
low
and
we
were
able
to
follow
the
windings
of
the
ravine
riding
over
the
dry
strip
of
for
a
good
distance
but
then
the
river
began
to
dart
about
capriciously
from
one
side
of
the
ravine
to
the
other
the
consequence
being
that
we
were
continually
finding
ourselves
obliged
to
ford
it
again
and
the
ravine
sides
were
now
so
steep
and
thickly
wooded
that
we
had
no
option
but
to
follow
the
river
after
two
hours
of
splashing
and
many
a
narrow
escape
from
complete
duckings
the
river
made
a
sudden
turn
southward
and
in
order
to
keep
on
our
road
towards
the
peaks
we
had
to
say
farewell
to
our
convenient
ravine
and
make
our
way
as
best
we
could
through
the
beechwood
forest
this
was
an
arduous
task
at
times
we
would
get
into
a
thicket
which
made
progress
impossible
forcing
us
to
retrace
our
steps
and
try
some
other
route
often
to
meet
only
the
same
difficulty
as
before
then
a
good
broad
clearing
would
turn
out
to
be
equally
impracticable
on
account
of
a
belt
of
bog
stretching
across
it
or
a
little
ravine
which
favoured
our
journey
for
a
time
would
resolve
itself
into
an
and
again
we
would
have
to
turn
back
fortunately
the
weather
was
fine
and
sunny
and
we
made
light
of
our
difficulties
occasionally
resting
for
a
while
to
admire
some
of
the
many
lovely
bits
of
landscape
chance
presented
to
our
eyes
or
to
feast
on
some
bush
heavy
laden
with
wild
red
currants
which
were
now
ripe
and
sweet
a
peculiar
phenomenon
suggestive
of
some
great
fire
in
bygone
ages
struck
me
in
these
forests
everywhere
among
the
younger
trees
stood
huge
dead
giants
gray
and
leafless
and
partially
charred
as
if
a
sudden
sea
of
fire
had
swept
over
them
drying
up
their
sap
and
destroying
their
vital
powers
being
quenched
however
by
some
sudden
agency
before
it
had
time
to
destroy
their
branches
and
trunks
completely
these
gray
skeletons
of
a
bygone
age
looked
weird
and
ghastly
standing
amid
the
fresh
green
trees
around
them
and
the
wind
sweeping
through
their
branches
produced
a
dry
harsh
rattle
which
contrasted
strangely
with
the
melodious
rustle
of
the
leafy
crests
of
their
comrades
for
three
or
four
hours
we
worked
our
way
through
the
forest
and
i
never
was
more
astonished
at
the
marvellous
powers
of
endurance
of
our
horses
than
on
this
occasion
to
say
nothing
of
their
extraordinary
cleverness
in
scrambling
over
the
trunks
of
fallen
trees
and
in
picking
their
way
through
boggy
ground
where
a
wrong
step
to
the
right
or
left
would
have
been
disastrous
at
last
we
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
all
more
or
less
scratched
and
bruised
and
thoroughly
tired
with
our
exertions
but
the
peaks
were
still
far
off
and
the
sun
was
getting
low
and
soon
another
strip
of
forest
loomed
ominously
in
front
of
us
we
resolved
therefore
to
go
no
farther
that
day
and
accordingly
cast
about
for
some
suitable
we
were
not
long
in
finding
a
little
nook
which
was
admirably
adapted
to
our
purpose
sheltered
by
a
cluster
of
moss
and
boulders
and
well
fenced
in
by
a
circle
of
shrubs
and
trees
we
found
a
fairy
circle
of
soft
velvety
greensward
jewelled
here
and
there
with
knots
of
scarlet
verbenas
and
wild
violets
bubbling
from
out
among
the
rocks
a
silver
clear
little
stream
flowed
down
its
centre
giving
just
the
slight
touch
of
life
and
movement
required
to
make
this
sylvan
retreat
as
cheerful
as
it
was
cosy
not
to
speak
of
its
convenience
as
regards
the
kettle
we
soon
had
our
horses
unsaddled
and
then
gregorio
and
set
to
work
to
light
a
fire
whilst
my
brother
went
out
with
his
gun
and
i
gathered
a
capful
of
red
currants
which
i
mashed
up
with
sugar
with
a
view
to
dessert
by
the
time
my
brother
came
back
bringing
with
him
a
brace
of
and
parrots
which
were
soon
plucked
and
spitted
the
rib
of
guanaco
gregorio
had
set
to
roast
was
done
to
a
nicety
and
we
all
fell
to
and
made
a
hearty
meal
finishing
with
the
red
currants
aforesaid
then
the
men
lit
their
pipes
and
the
social
went
round
whilst
we
lay
watching
the
sun
setting
over
the
mountains
gilding
their
peaks
with
ever
varying
tints
and
making
their
snowy
glaciers
glow
warm
and
golden
under
its
magic
touch
far
below
at
our
feet
lay
the
ravine
with
the
river
we
had
so
often
crossed
that
day
looking
like
a
winding
silver
thread
in
the
distance
around
us
reigned
perfect
peace
the
chattering
flocks
of
parrots
which
had
made
the
woods
noisy
during
had
gone
to
their
leafy
roosts
and
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
silent
trees
a
few
little
birds
who
no
doubt
had
their
homes
in
the
chinks
of
the
boulders
which
formed
the
background
of
our
camp
hovered
around
us
anxiously
for
some
time
till
finding
they
had
nothing
to
fear
from
their
strange
visitors
they
took
heart
and
hopped
from
stone
to
stone
into
their
respective
lodgings
and
after
chirping
a
note
or
two
were
silent
for
the
night
we
were
not
long
in
following
their
example
and
rolling
myself
up
in
my
guanaco
robe
with
my
head
on
my
saddle
i
slept
as
sound
and
sweet
a
sleep
under
the
greenwood
tree
as
ever
blessed
a
weary
mortal
neither
puck
nor
ariel
played
any
pranks
with
me
though
for
ought
i
know
titania
and
oberon
and
their
fairy
following
flying
from
the
sceptical
modern
spirit
which
ignores
them
may
well
have
made
these
secluded
sylvan
haunts
their
own
we
were
in
the
saddle
early
the
next
morning
and
plunging
into
the
woods
pursued
our
way
through
the
same
difficulties
which
had
hampered
our
progress
the
day
before
after
a
time
however
we
came
to
a
region
evidently
much
frequented
by
wild
horses
and
eventually
we
hit
on
a
path
worn
by
them
right
through
the
woods
and
following
this
we
jogged
along
at
a
very
fair
pace
soon
our
horses
began
to
neigh
and
prick
up
their
ears
as
we
advanced
towards
a
clearing
their
cries
were
answered
from
somewhere
beyond
us
and
pushing
forward
into
the
open
we
came
upon
a
herd
of
wild
horses
who
hearing
our
advance
had
stopped
grazing
and
now
they
stood
collected
in
a
knot
together
snorting
and
stamping
and
staring
at
us
in
evident
amazement
one
of
their
number
came
boldly
trotting
out
to
meet
us
and
evidently
with
no
pacific
intentions
his
wicked
eye
and
his
white
teeth
which
he
had
bared
fiercely
looked
by
no
means
reassuring
but
suddenly
he
stopped
short
looked
at
us
for
a
moment
and
then
with
a
wild
snort
dashed
madly
away
followed
by
the
whole
herd
they
disappeared
like
lightning
over
the
brow
of
a
deep
ravine
to
emerge
again
on
our
view
after
a
couple
of
seconds
scampering
like
goats
up
its
opposite
side
which
rose
almost
perpendicular
to
a
height
of
six
or
seven
hundred
feet
they
reached
its
crest
at
full
gallop
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
without
pausing
an
instant
disappeared
again
leaving
us
wondering
and
amazed
at
their
marvellous
agility
i
had
often
seen
their
paths
leading
up
which
a
man
could
scarcely
climb
but
till
now
that
i
had
witnessed
a
specimen
of
their
powers
with
my
own
eyes
i
had
scarcely
been
able
to
believe
them
possessed
of
a
nimbleness
and
cleverness
of
foot
which
would
not
discredit
a
chamois
from
the
open
space
on
which
we
were
now
standing
we
could
see
a
broad
lake
lying
at
the
base
of
some
very
high
hills
behind
which
lay
the
mighty
mountain
which
culminated
in
the
three
peaks
we
were
desirous
of
reaching
and
as
a
ravine
appeared
to
wind
in
that
direction
from
the
head
of
the
lake
we
now
pushed
forward
towards
the
latter
occasionally
profiting
by
numerous
wild
horse
paths
to
expedite
our
advance
after
a
weary
scramble
of
several
hours
duration
we
threaded
a
last
belt
of
forest
blundered
and
floundered
through
a
last
bog
and
after
a
short
ride
over
a
grassy
plain
studded
with
bushes
which
were
literally
blue
with
a
profusion
of
found
ourselves
on
the
shores
of
a
splendid
sheet
of
water
the
sight
well
repaid
us
for
our
trouble
the
lake
which
was
two
or
three
miles
broad
lay
encircled
by
tall
hills
covered
with
thick
vegetation
which
grew
close
down
to
the
water
edge
beyond
the
hills
rose
the
three
red
peaks
and
the
cordilleras
their
white
glaciers
with
the
white
clouds
resting
on
them
were
all
mirrored
to
marvellous
perfection
in
the
motionless
lake
whose
crystal
waters
were
of
the
most
extraordinarily
brilliant
blue
i
have
ever
beheld
round
the
lake
ran
a
narrow
strip
of
white
sand
and
exactly
in
its
centre
stood
a
little
green
island
with
a
clump
of
beeches
growing
on
it
each
colour
the
white
the
green
the
blue
was
so
brilliant
the
scene
the
wooded
hills
the
glaciers
rising
into
the
blue
above
and
sinking
mirrored
into
the
blue
below
was
so
unique
the
spirit
of
silence
and
solitude
which
lay
over
all
so
impressive
that
for
a
long
time
we
stood
as
if
spellbound
none
of
us
uttering
a
word
suddenly
we
were
startled
by
a
rushing
sound
behind
us
and
in
another
instant
making
the
air
shake
as
it
went
and
almost
touching
me
with
the
tip
of
its
mighty
wing
a
condor
swept
past
us
rising
with
rapid
flight
up
up
up
into
the
air
we
following
him
with
our
eyes
till
he
became
a
mere
speck
on
the
sky
and
finally
disappeared
thousands
of
feet
up
in
the
air
this
incident
seemed
to
break
the
charm
that
held
us
silent
and
we
broke
into
a
chorus
of
exclamations
of
praise
and
wonder
as
every
second
some
new
beauty
in
the
scene
before
us
struck
our
admiring
gaze
resuming
our
journey
we
rode
along
the
narrow
strip
of
beach
towards
the
head
of
the
lake
occasionally
we
were
forced
into
the
water
as
at
some
spots
there
was
no
beach
at
all
but
at
any
rate
we
got
on
much
quicker
here
than
we
had
up
to
the
present
and
in
a
comparatively
short
space
of
time
found
ourselves
at
the
head
of
the
lake
we
were
close
to
the
three
peaks
which
we
could
now
see
were
parts
of
the
crater
of
an
extinct
volcano
the
other
portions
of
which
had
fallen
in
a
prey
to
the
action
of
the
weather
we
camped
by
the
side
of
a
little
stream
which
flowed
into
the
lake
all
night
long
we
could
hear
the
thunder
of
avalanches
or
what
perhaps
might
have
been
the
rumbling
of
some
distant
volcano
and
i
found
myself
nervously
expecting
a
repetition
of
the
earthquake
which
had
surprised
us
so
disagreeably
at
the
laguna
blanca
illustration
we
were
the
first
who
ever
burst
on
to
that
silent
sea
in
the
morning
we
rode
up
a
tall
hill
from
which
we
could
get
a
good
view
of
the
interior
at
the
same
time
we
were
able
to
assure
ourselves
that
it
would
be
useless
slightly
provisioned
as
we
were
to
attempt
to
penetrate
any
farther
the
country
before
us
being
still
more
thickly
wooded
than
that
we
had
already
traversed
for
some
distance
we
could
catch
glimpses
among
the
hills
of
bright
green
valleys
with
whose
excellent
pastures
our
nimble
friends
the
wild
horses
were
doubtless
well
acquainted
and
farther
on
rose
a
forest
of
white
peaks
one
towering
above
the
other
till
the
tallest
faded
hazy
and
indistinct
into
the
skies
i
would
fain
have
dived
into
their
farthest
mystery
but
it
was
not
to
be
so
with
a
sigh
of
regret
we
turned
our
horses
heads
in
a
homeward
direction
we
got
back
to
the
camp
late
in
the
evening
having
taxed
our
horses
powers
to
the
utmost
to
accomplish
our
return
trip
in
one
day
our
account
of
the
wonderful
blue
lake
and
the
strange
country
beyond
excited
the
envy
of
those
who
had
remained
behind
and
led
to
a
discussion
as
to
the
practicability
of
our
entering
the
mountains
bag
and
baggage
but
the
difficulties
in
our
way
were
too
many
and
formidable
and
reluctantly
we
were
compelled
to
abandon
this
seductive
plan
chapter
xviii
we
think
of
returning
to
the
cordilleras
the
last
of
the
wild
horses
mosquitoes
a
stormy
night
a
calamity
the
last
of
our
biscuit
the
utility
of
a
few
more
days
spent
in
the
cordilleras
brought
us
near
the
time
when
it
was
necessary
to
begin
to
think
of
returning
to
sandy
point
our
provisions
were
beginning
to
sink
rapidly
tea
and
coffee
and
sugar
we
still
had
plenty
of
but
the
biscuit
bags
were
getting
ominously
low
and
all
our
other
dainties
had
already
been
consumed
and
many
of
our
camps
were
painfully
remembered
in
connection
with
this
or
that
article
of
food
which
had
been
partaken
of
there
for
the
last
time
thus
near
los
bargnales
we
had
finished
our
last
tin
of
butter
los
morros
witnessed
the
broaching
of
our
last
tin
of
preserved
milk
and
here
in
the
cordilleras
we
ruefully
swallowed
our
last
dish
of
porridge
guanaco
meat
is
good
so
is
ostrich
meat
good
too
is
an
gipsy
life
in
a
bright
climate
with
lots
of
sport
and
pleasant
companionship
but
the
goodness
of
all
these
things
is
materially
enhanced
by
the
accompaniment
of
good
cheer
and
materially
depreciated
by
the
lack
of
it
thus
when
our
daily
began
to
consist
of
a
series
of
ingenious
changes
on
the
monotonous
theme
of
ostrich
and
guanaco
meat
varied
only
by
baked
biscuits
our
thoughts
somehow
began
to
run
in
the
groove
of
home
and
we
often
found
ourselves
talking
of
dear
old
england
and
its
roast
beef
in
a
strain
of
affectionate
longing
somehow
the
air
of
patagonia
did
not
seem
so
bracing
and
inspiriting
as
at
first
we
began
to
grow
sceptical
on
the
subject
of
guanaco
and
ostrich
hunting
we
discovered
that
the
wild
duck
were
too
tame
to
give
real
good
sport
and
that
in
a
country
where
these
birds
get
up
in
flocks
is
simply
a
matter
of
loading
and
pulling
the
trigger
discomforts
and
hardships
of
which
we
once
made
light
we
now
began
to
take
as
serious
matters
and
our
tempers
once
so
sweet
and
accommodating
had
begun
to
grow
acrid
and
touchy
we
all
felt
more
inclined
to
dwell
on
the
weight
of
our
individual
opinions
and
less
disposed
to
value
those
of
our
companions
once
we
had
avoided
discussions
as
liable
to
disturb
the
harmony
which
reigned
among
us
now
we
welcomed
them
as
pleasant
irritants
and
even
went
out
of
our
way
to
provoke
them
the
result
was
that
one
day
on
somebody
suggesting
that
perhaps
we
had
better
think
of
returning
after
a
little
opposition
as
a
matter
of
course
for
in
our
then
mood
it
was
quite
sufficient
for
anybody
to
propose
a
plan
for
everybody
else
to
immediately
gainsay
it
we
unanimously
agreed
that
considering
that
we
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
patagonia
considering
too
that
our
provisions
were
nearly
exhausted
and
that
our
horses
were
very
stale
it
was
better
to
start
at
once
so
one
morning
the
packhorses
were
driven
up
and
the
familiar
occupation
of
loading
them
gone
through
it
had
now
become
a
much
simpler
matter
than
formerly
and
we
were
enabled
to
comfort
ourselves
with
the
reflection
that
the
loss
in
our
larder
was
a
gain
as
regards
the
time
economised
every
day
in
packing
up
before
leaving
our
pretty
camp
we
carved
our
names
on
one
of
the
trees
and
erected
a
cairn
on
the
top
of
which
we
left
a
bottle
the
only
emblem
of
civilisation
we
could
spare
then
mounting
we
turned
our
backs
on
the
cordilleras
and
set
out
towards
the
ravine
we
had
entered
by
whose
name
among
the
traders
is
the
wild
horse
ravine
as
we
were
riding
along
a
solitary
horse
suddenly
appeared
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
and
after
eyeing
us
for
a
moment
came
tearing
down
towards
us
at
a
frantic
gallop
with
a
loud
neigh
and
perhaps
dangerous
intentions
our
troop
of
horses
scattered
in
all
directions
gregorio
and
got
out
their
bolas
prepared
for
emergencies
and
we
curiously
awaited
the
sequel
of
the
incident
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
untamed
steed
without
abating
his
speed
one
jot
and
evidently
determined
to
charge
right
at
us
we
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
but
put
our
trust
in
gregorio
deftness
though
it
was
perhaps
well
it
was
not
put
to
the
test
when
within
about
ten
yards
of
us
the
wild
horse
suddenly
stopped
stood
still
for
one
second
and
then
turned
and
with
two
sets
of
bolas
whizzing
harmlessly
round
his
ears
went
bounding
away
as
fast
as
he
had
come
never
stopping
till
he
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
he
had
first
appeared
on
this
was
the
last
we
saw
of
the
bagnales
late
in
the
afternoon
we
crossed
the
ravine
where
we
had
camped
before
entering
the
cordilleras
here
we
were
assailed
by
a
thick
cloud
of
mosquitoes
who
annoyed
us
and
our
poor
horses
horribly
buzzing
round
us
and
biting
viciously
wherever
they
could
settle
for
a
time
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
angry
exclamations
and
objurgations
mingled
with
occasional
cries
of
fiendish
joy
as
one
of
us
succeeded
in
destroying
half
a
dozen
of
our
thirsty
tormentors
with
one
slap
of
the
hand
but
from
the
fury
of
their
numbers
there
was
no
refuge
opposition
only
increased
their
virulence
and
those
who
were
fiercest
and
most
energetic
in
driving
them
off
were
always
surrounded
by
the
thickest
cloud
relief
only
came
when
we
got
out
of
the
ravine
into
the
plain
and
there
one
puff
of
wind
swept
our
enemy
clean
away
in
a
second
not
one
mosquito
remaining
to
curse
at
or
to
kill
thankful
for
our
release
from
this
annoyance
we
were
not
disposed
to
grumble
very
much
at
the
oppressive
heat
to
which
we
were
exposed
during
the
whole
of
the
day
though
the
sun
beat
down
on
us
from
a
cloudless
sky
with
overpowering
force
and
our
burnt
and
blistered
faces
smarted
painfully
under
its
fiery
rays
we
camped
that
night
near
a
broad
lagoon
and
for
the
next
few
days
continued
our
journey
over
the
plains
without
anything
of
note
occurring
hitherto
we
had
been
pretty
fortunate
as
regards
the
weather
and
the
nights
especially
with
hardly
an
exception
had
been
calm
and
fine
but
one
march
before
reaching
river
we
camped
in
a
broad
valley
where
our
experience
of
patagonian
nights
was
unpleasantly
varied
shortly
after
we
had
gone
to
bed
the
misgivings
which
the
threatening
aspect
of
the
sky
had
called
up
as
we
took
a
last
glance
at
the
weather
before
turning
in
were
more
than
realised
the
wind
began
to
pipe
ominously
through
the
grass
and
before
long
it
was
blowing
a
regular
gale
a
sudden
squall
carried
our
tents
clean
out
of
their
pickets
and
sent
them
whirling
through
the
air
a
scene
of
the
most
uncomfortable
confusion
ensued
it
was
pouring
with
rain
pitch
dark
and
the
wind
was
blowing
with
such
force
that
it
was
hard
to
keep
one
legs
rugs
and
clothes
and
smouldering
embers
were
being
blown
in
all
directions
everybody
was
blundering
about
in
the
darkness
tripping
up
over
something
or
falling
against
some
one
else
and
the
howling
of
the
wind
the
rush
of
the
river
the
chorus
of
loud
imprecations
in
various
languages
and
the
unearthly
moaning
and
whimpering
of
the
dogs
made
up
as
wild
a
scene
of
noisy
confusion
as
could
possibly
be
imagined
several
vain
attempts
were
made
to
set
up
the
tents
but
the
wind
was
too
strong
and
at
last
perfectly
drenched
through
we
had
to
give
up
the
attempt
and
crawl
into
whatever
furs
first
came
to
hand
to
wait
till
the
storm
should
pass
over
this
it
did
not
do
till
about
four
in
the
morning
just
as
it
was
getting
light
it
was
too
late
or
early
to
go
to
bed
again
then
so
we
crept
out
sleepy
and
damp
and
miserable
and
drank
hot
coffee
round
a
smoking
fire
till
the
sun
got
up
and
warmed
us
thoroughly
we
were
to
camp
that
evening
by
the
river
and
as
it
was
a
good
way
off
we
set
out
soon
after
breakfast
we
passed
several
herds
of
guanaco
and
also
a
herd
of
about
eighty
or
a
hundred
ostriches
i
had
never
seen
so
many
together
before
we
gave
chase
to
them
but
the
dogs
got
so
excited
running
first
after
one
ostrich
and
then
after
another
that
at
last
they
all
got
away
a
calamity
happened
to
us
that
afternoon
the
mare
who
carried
the
two
little
bags
with
all
that
remained
of
our
greatest
treasure
our
biscuits
suddenly
took
fright
at
something
and
galloped
wildly
away
we
followed
her
course
with
anxious
eyes
and
beating
hearts
not
daring
to
go
after
her
lest
it
should
aggravate
her
fears
for
a
time
the
pack
sat
firmly
and
we
began
to
breathe
but
even
while
we
watched
oh
horror
it
began
to
incline
towards
one
side
and
then
gradually
slid
over
the
moment
the
mare
felt
it
underneath
her
she
began
to
kick
out
and
galloping
quicker
and
quicker
in
a
very
few
seconds
she
was
packless
and
pacified
then
only
did
we
gallop
forward
to
know
the
worst
and
the
worst
was
bad
indeed
a
long
trail
of
broken
biscuits
sown
in
the
grass
marked
the
course
the
unfortunate
mare
had
taken
and
when
we
got
to
the
bags
only
a
few
small
handfuls
remained
we
tried
to
gather
together
what
we
could
but
the
biscuit
by
long
travel
had
broken
into
fine
dust
and
it
was
quite
impossible
to
pick
much
out
of
the
long
grass
it
had
fallen
into
our
last
kettle
had
also
severely
suffered
in
the
fracâs
a
big
hole
appearing
in
its
side
when
after
a
long
search
it
was
at
last
found
guillaume
talked
hopefully
of
being
able
to
mend
it
but
failing
this
desirable
consummation
farewell
the
cheering
cup
of
maté
farewell
the
morning
bowl
of
grateful
coffee
farewell
content
the
chiefest
comfort
gone
slowly
and
mournfully
we
tied
up
what
was
left
of
the
biscuits
in
a
small
canvas
bag
which
gregorio
secured
to
his
saddle
and
then
after
having
devoted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
grazing
on
all
fours
on
such
fragments
as
could
be
found
among
the
grass
we
continued
our
journey
reflecting
on
the
vanity
of
all
things
we
arrived
at
river
that
evening
and
fording
it
camped
near
the
bank
it
rained
again
during
the
night
but
as
there
was
little
or
no
wind
it
did
not
matter
much
and
excepting
a
pervading
sense
of
dampness
we
suffered
no
great
discomfort
continuing
our
march
that
day
over
the
plains
that
lay
between
river
and
the
gallegos
we
saw
the
smoke
of
numerous
fires
in
the
distance
but
there
was
no
response
to
the
fires
we
lit
in
answer
and
so
we
concluded
that
they
were
only
old
fires
which
were
still
smouldering
the
next
day
one
of
our
party
had
an
opportunity
of
practically
testing
the
value
of
fires
as
a
means
of
signalling
one
whereabouts
in
the
pampa
he
had
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
had
gone
out
on
foot
at
about
five
with
his
rifle
to
try
and
stalk
a
guanaco
at
ten
he
had
not
returned
as
we
had
only
a
short
march
to
make
that
day
it
did
not
matter
if
we
started
a
little
later
than
usual
so
we
lay
about
waiting
for
his
return
eleven
twelve
came
but
still
no
signs
of
him
he
had
now
been
away
more
than
seven
hours
and
i
began
to
think
that
something
must
have
happened
to
him
we
therefore
rode
up
on
the
plains
to
look
for
him
lighting
fires
at
intervals
to
show
the
position
of
the
camp
and
anxiously
scanning
the
horizon
to
see
whether
he
had
also
made
a
fire
but
though
we
rode
about
for
a
long
time
nothing
was
to
be
seen
and
we
went
back
to
the
camp
wondering
what
could
have
happened
just
as
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
perplexed
discussion
as
to
what
steps
to
take
in
the
matter
to
our
relief
he
suddenly
came
into
the
camp
and
tired
and
carrying
the
head
and
ribs
of
a
guanaco
on
his
back
shortly
after
leaving
the
camp
he
had
wounded
a
guanaco
which
went
off
however
and
led
him
a
long
dance
for
two
or
three
hours
without
his
being
able
to
come
within
range
of
it
again
in
despair
he
at
last
fired
a
couple
of
shots
at
it
from
a
long
range
but
as
it
seemed
without
reaching
his
mark
these
shots
exhausted
his
ammunition
our
supply
of
being
very
low
and
he
having
only
allowed
himself
three
rounds
loath
to
abandon
the
wounded
animal
he
had
followed
it
pertinaciously
over
ravines
and
hills
always
vowing
to
himself
that
beyond
a
certain
point
he
would
follow
no
farther
but
always
being
lured
on
by
the
signs
of
exhaustion
the
guanaco
was
showing
to
go
just
a
little
farther
at
last
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
it
lie
down
and
with
a
shout
of
triumph
ran
forward
to
despatch
it
with
his
but
at
his
approach
the
guanaco
jumped
up
again
and
slowly
as
it
ran
it
was
enabled
to
outdistance
its
relentless
pursuer
who
was
already
thoroughly
done
up
with
his
exertions
but
feeling
that
with
patience
he
must
conquer
at
last
he
felt
less
inclined
than
ever
to
abandon
his
prey
already
numerous
hawks
and
condors
were
circling
over
the
doomed
guanaco
and
the
thought
that
the
fruit
of
his
labours
would
only
go
to
provide
a
feast
for
these
hateful
marauders
was
an
additional
incentive
to
persevere
at
last
success
rewarded
his
efforts
waiting
till
the
guanaco
lay
down
once
more
he
approached
it
by
degrees
and
then
when
within
twenty
yards
or
so
of
it
made
a
dash
towards
it
it
stumbled
in
trying
to
get
up
and
he
had
just
time
to
rush
up
and
catch
it
by
the
ear
and
with
a
happy
stroke
of
his
long
end
its
sufferings
it
was
only
when
he
had
cut
it
up
and
laden
himself
with
the
best
parts
that
he
began
to
reflect
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
chase
he
had
quite
forgotten
in
which
direction
the
camp
lay
he
had
followed
the
guanaco
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
often
having
to
run
to
keep
it
in
view
and
all
he
knew
was
that
several
hours
must
have
elapsed
since
he
started
in
its
pursuit
he
lit
several
fires
but
he
only
had
a
few
matches
and
the
fires
unfortunately
soon
went
out
so
that
he
had
no
means
of
showing
us
his
own
whereabouts
however
he
struck
out
in
a
direction
in
which
he
imagined
the
camp
must
lie
and
kept
wearily
trudging
on
under
his
load
which
tired
as
he
was
he
was
naturally
loath
to
part
from
after
he
had
gone
a
good
distance
he
looked
around
and
then
the
skyline
behind
him
appeared
to
be
singularly
like
that
he
remembered
having
seen
on
leaving
the
camp
but
then
the
skyline
to
the
left
somehow
had
the
same
look
too
which
was
the
right
one
he
was
just
revolving
this
puzzling
question
in
his
mind
in
no
very
pleasant
humour
when
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
smoke
of
the
fires
we
had
lit
and
happily
not
far
off
in
the
direction
he
had
instinctively
chosen
from
the
first
as
the
right
one
the
sight
gave
him
new
vigour
and
though
he
had
still
a
good
distance
to
go
he
managed
to
reach
the
camp
at
last
without
having
to
throw
away
the
meat
which
had
cost
him
such
a
hard
day

continued

in

we
rode
down
a
broad
valley
which
led
to
the
gallegos
river
where
we
were
to
camp
for
the
night
on
reaching
its
farther
end
we
were
suddenly
surprised
by
the
sight
of
an
indian
camp
composed
of
three
tents
which
were
pitched
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
having
little
curiosity
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
their
inmates
we
continued
our
journey
along
the
river
towards
our
intended
camp
but
gregorio
and
rode
over
to
see
them
they
rejoined
us
an
hour
afterwards
had
found
an
old
friend
an
argentine
gaucho
named
isidoro
who
had
accompanied
him
on
a
former
trip
and
whom
curiously
enough
he
had
parted
from
a
year
before
on
exactly
the
same
spot
where
he
now
met
him
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
isidoro
was
going
to
pay
us
a
visit
the
next
day
as
i
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
him
and
was
anxious
to
make
his
acquaintance
we
camped
near
the
river
seven
or
eight
miles
away
from
the
indian
camp
and
consequently
we
hoped
rather
too
far
to
attract
a
call
from
these
people
the
disagreeable
experience
of
their
visit
whilst
we
were
at
cape
gregorio
being
still
fresh
in
my
mind
early
in
the
morning
we
saw
a
man
riding
in
the
direction
of
the
camp
who
i
was
told
was
isidoro
he
presently
appeared
among
us
and
except
for
his
moustache
and
beard
and
the
superior
cleanliness
of
his
dress
he
might
have
been
taken
for
an
indian
he
was
warmly
welcomed
by
the
guides
amongst
whom
his
unequalled
proficiency
in
all
that
pertains
to
the
pampa
craft
and
his
personal
character
had
gained
him
great
prestige
isidoro
did
not
stop
long
as
he
was
going
to
hunt
with
the
indians
that
day
so
after
having
taken
a
few
cups
of
maté
and
smoked
a
pipe
or
two
in
silence
he
said
and
took
his
departure
as
he
rode
away
i
could
not
help
admiring
his
manly
bearing
and
his
perfect
seat
on
a
splendid
looking
horse
which
seemed
not
unworthy
of
its
master
he
wore
his
guanaco
capa
with
a
certain
foppish
grace
that
one
might
have
looked
in
vain
for
in
gregorio
or
any
of
the
others
and
every
article
of
his
accoutrements
from
his
carefully
coiled
lasso
to
the
garters
round
his
new
was
perfectly
finished
and
natty
after
he
had
gone
my
husband
and
myself
started
off
we
soon
killed
a
guanaco
and
were
busily
engaged
in
the
laborious
operation
of
cutting
it
up
when
we
heard
a
grunt
and
looking
up
saw
an
indian
behind
us
on
horseback
he
watched
our
clumsy
efforts
for
some
time
in
silence
occasionally
breaking
out
into
loud
laughter
and
then
dismounting
took
out
his
own
knife
and
with
a
few
adroit
and
easy
cuts
did
the
whole
trick
in
no
time
he
rewarded
himself
for
his
labours
by
cutting
out
the
kidneys
and
the
heart
and
eating
them
raw
and
bloody
there
and
then
this
disgusting
repast
over
he
smacked
his
lips
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
grinning
eloquently
and
leaving
us
wondering
and
horrified
the
evening
after
our
halt
at
gallegos
we
camped
in
a
stony
rocky
region
where
there
was
very
little
grass
but
plenty
of
quail
several
of
which
we
shot
though
we
found
them
to
be
very
dry
and
unpalatable
it
poured
all
the
next
day
so
we
were
compelled
to
remain
where
we
were
much
against
our
will
to
have
to
lie
all
day
in
a
little
tent
with
a
dreary
bit
of
gray
landscape
to
look
out
upon
while
the
rain
patters
on
the
canvas
in
a
remorseless
dispiriting
monotone
is
one
of
the
most
severe
trials
one
patience
can
be
put
to
and
ours
came
very
badly
out
of
the
ordeal
patagonia
being
by
no
means
complimentarily
alluded
to
in
the
course
of
these
weary
hours
however
towards
sundown
it
cleared
up
and
we
were
able
to
have
a
turn
and
stretch
our
limbs
in
the
open
air
before
it
got
dark
two
days
after
leaving
this
camp
we
struck
the
indian
trail
to
sandy
point
and
on
the
third
we
camped
opposite
cape
gregorio
not
far
from
the
place
whence
we
had
made
our
visit
to
the
indians
here
we
intended
halting
for
a
couple
of
days
to
take
in
a
good
supply
of
meat
before
starting
for
sandy
point
as
neither
guanaco
nor
ostriches
were
to
be
met
with
except
by
a
mere
chance
any
farther
south
and
all
our
other
provisions
being
exhausted
we
had
now
to
rely
solely
upon
the
product
of
the
chase
for
our
food
in
the
morning
two
traders
passed
through
our
camp
and
we
were
delighted
to
find
that
they
had
a
small
bag
of
bread
which
they
were
taking
to
the
indians
they
sold
us
twenty
small
loaves
each
about
the
size
of
a
penny
roll
for
five
pounds
and
i
think
they
got
the
best
of
the
bargain
for
the
bread
was
half
mildewed
and
scarcely
eatable
and
so
heavy
that
even
the
stomach
of
an
ostrich
could
scarcely
have
compassed
its
digestion
with
impunity
famished
as
we
were
we
preferred
to
give
it
to
the
dogs
who
showed
their
good
sense
by
turning
up
their
noses
at
it
and
unless
the
foxes
rashly
experimented
upon
it
after
our
departure
for
aught
i
know
these
expensive
loaves
may
still
be
lying
in
a
fossil
state
on
the
patagonian
pampas
we
all
went
out
that
day
but
were
not
very
successful
managed
to
run
down
a
young
one
with
his
dog
and
shot
one
but
as
he
killed
it
some
twenty
miles
away
from
our
camp
he
could
only
bring
the
head
and
the
two
sides
not
daring
to
load
his
horse
with
more
but
meat
had
to
be
procured
somehow
so
next
day
whilst
the
others
went
on
along
the
trail
with
the
packhorses
my
husband
myself
and
gregorio
went
out
hunting
again
intending
to
catch
up
the
others
before
the
evening
we
rode
for
several
hours
towards
cape
gregorio
but
although
we
saw
several
ostriches
they
got
up
very
wild
and
pursuit
of
them
was
always
out
of
the
question
guanaco
there
were
none
to
be
seen
this
was
very
dispiriting
if
we
did
not
manage
to
kill
anything
here
it
was
still
more
unlikely
that
we
should
be
able
to
do
so
farther
on
our
companions
were
relying
on
our
efforts
and
to
have
to
join
them
would
have
been
in
itself
vexatious
enough
from
a
sportsman
point
of
view
apart
from
the
serious
and
practical
consideration
that
we
could
scarcely
go
on
to
sandy
point
which
was
quite
three
days
march
away
without
food
so
we
kept
riding
on
towards
cape
gregorio
in
the
hopes
of
still
being
able
to
find
something
we
presently
sighted
some
guanacos
grazing
at
the
base
of
a
ridge
of
hills
and
whilst
gregorio
went
after
an
ostrich
which
sprang
up
at
that
moment
we
three
spurred
our
horses
and
separating
so
as
to
attract
as
little
attention
as
possible
rode
towards
them
i
soon
lost
sight
of
my
companions
who
disappeared
down
some
of
the
many
gulches
that
led
to
the
valley
where
the
guanaco
were
grazing
fervently
praying
that
one
of
us
might
be
successful
i
hurried
on
when
i
got
into
the
valley
to
my
chagrin
i
saw
that
the
guanaco
already
aware
of
danger
were
moving
slowly
up
the
valley
not
at
a
great
distance
from
where
i
was
but
still
a
good
way
beyond
who
was
a
long
way
to
the
left
was
much
nearer
to
them
and
my
husband
was
in
a
similar
position
to
the
right
as
we
approached
the
guanaco
trotted
up
among
the
hills
and
disappeared
we
had
no
option
but
to
follow
them
entering
on
the
range
of
hills
at
different
points
as
the
herd
would
probably
scatter
as
soon
as
we
came
close
upon
them
i
came
upon
them
of
a
sudden
and
as
i
had
surmised
they
all
broke
into
different
directions
i
took
a
flying
shot
at
one
but
missed
and
presently
a
report
on
each
side
of
me
showed
that
the
others
had
had
a
shot
too
i
was
soon
joined
by
my
husband
who
had
also
been
unsuccessful
but
did
not
turn
up
and
we
began
to
hope
that
he
might
have
killed
something
we
presently
saw
him
galloping
full
speed
up
a
distant
hill
after
a
guanaco
which
was
no
doubt
wounded
but
which
seemed
to
be
going
too
gamely
to
admit
of
our
being
very
sanguine
as
to
his
chance
of
ultimately
getting
at
it
we
waited
for
some
time
but
he
did
not
reappear
and
so
we
went
down
into
the
valley
to
look
for
gregorio
he
soon
came
in
sight
and
unfortunately
as
as
we
ourselves
were
matters
were
now
getting
serious
the
day
was
far
gone
and
to
catch
up
our
companions
on
our
jaded
horses
would
have
been
a
hard
task
unless
we
started
at
once
we
were
therefore
obliged
to
relinquish
all
hope
of
getting
any
guanaco
ourselves
that
day
our
only
consolation
being
that
mr
b
prolonged
absence
boded
that
he
at
least
had
been
successful
we
waited
for
him
a
little
but
as
he
did
not
come
knowing
that
he
could
find
the
way
to
the
place
where
the
others
were
to
camp
we
rode
on
lighting
fires
at
intervals
to
show
our
whereabouts
our
horses
were
so
tired
that
we
could
scarcely
get
them
into
a
trot
and
to
our
dismay
we
suddenly
found
it
was
getting
dark
the
sky
had
been
clouded
all
day
and
we
had
had
no
sun
to
judge
the
time
by
the
result
being
that
we
were
two
or
three
hours
out
in
our
calculations
it
is
very
easy
to
guess
the
time
within
half
an
hour
or
so
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
the
excitement
of
our
various
runs
after
guanacos
and
ostriches
had
so
absorbed
us
that
the
hours
had
slipped
by
unperceived
we
thus
found
ourselves
face
to
face
with
the
uncomfortable
knowledge
that
it
being
quite
impossible
to
catch
up
the
others
we
should
have
to
go
to
bed
in
the
open
and
unless
had
killed
his
guanaco
supperless
the
unpleasantness
of
this
at
any
time
disagreeable
contingency
was
increased
on
this
occasion
by
the
prospect
of
our
getting
wet
through
into
the
bargain
for
the
aspect
of
the
sky
was
very
threatening
and
it
was
only
in
keeping
with
our
day
luck
that
there
should
be
a
downpour
of
rain
during
the
night
but
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
be
done
but
give
in
to
the
inevitable
as
cheerfully
as
we
could
so
we
dismounted
and
unsaddled
our
horses
carefully
tethering
them
to
some
bushes
lest
they
should
stray
away
in
the
night
and
then
we
sat
down
to
await
b
coming
the
numerous
fires
we
had
lit
on
the
way
making
us
quite
sure
he
would
be
able
to
find
us
but
it
grew
darker
and
darker
the
tooth
of
hunger
got
fiercer
and
fiercer
and
still
he
did
not
come
what
could
have
happened
surely
he
must
have
run
down
the
guanaco
or
given
up
the
chase
hours
ago
perhaps
he
has
met
with
some
accident
impossible
with
these
and
other
reflections
we
beguiled
the
anxious
moments
hoping
against
hope
that
before
long
a
goodly
rib
of
guanaco
would
be
roasting
at
the
blazing
fire
we
had
prepared
in
rash
anticipation
of
its
advent
but
time
went
on
already
we
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
bushes
in
the
distance
the
hills
faded
away
altogether
into
the
darkness
and
our
missing
companion
did
not
come
having
strained
our
eyes
blind
peering
into
the
gloom
we
now
sat
silently
straining
our
ears
to
catch
the
slightest
sign
of
an
approaching
footstep
but
our
hopes
grew
gradually
fainter
and
fainter
and
at
last
we
were
obliged
to
give
them
up
altogether
gregorio
fortunately
found
a
small
piece
of
guanaco
meat
in
one
of
his
which
we
cooked
and
ate
a
small
mouthful
being
all
each
of
us
got
mingled
with
our
regrets
for
our
enforced
fast
were
speculations
as
to
what
was
doing
at
that
moment
had
he
killed
his
guanaco
and
horrible
thought
was
he
at
that
very
moment
perhaps
roasting
its
head
in
the
ashes
or
was
he
in
a
worse
plight
than
ourselves
supperless
as
well
as
companionless
our
thoughts
reverted
to
the
other
party
too
who
no
doubt
were
in
some
anxiety
as
to
what
could
have
become
of
us
i
did
not
sleep
very
sound
that
night
nor
did
my
companions
as
may
be
imagined
just
as
day
broke
the
dogs
gave
tongue
there
was
a
crashing
among
the
bushes
and
rode
up
with
an
eager
hungry
look
on
his
face
which
boded
no
good
have
you
got
anything
to
eat
were
his
first
words
to
which
our
despairing
answer
was
good
gracious
have
you
and
our
faces
grew
longer
and
more
disconsolate
than
ever
as
the
hopes
of
a
good
breakfast
which
had
hitherto
sustained
us
were
remorselessly
shattered
on
both
sides
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
immediately
saddle
and
ride
off
to
join
our
companions
on
the
way
told
us
how
he
had
followed
the
wounded
guanaco
till
he
had
run
his
horse
to
a
complete
standstill
and
like
us
having
been
overtaken
by
darkness
had
been
obliged
to
stop
where
he
was
till
morning
after
several
hours
ride
we
got
to
the
place
where
the
others
were
camped
and
found
them
very
much
alarmed
at
our
protracted
absence
though
they
had
naturally
supposed
that
we
had
been
taken
a
long
distance
out
of
our
way
by
the
chase
we
lost
no
time
in
making
a
hearty
meal
on
what
remained
of
the
guanaco
meat
which
being
finished
there
was
no
food
of
any
kind
in
the
camp
chapter
xx
the
horses
lost
unpleasant

found

a
strange
hunt
a
stern
chase
the
mystery
solved
the
cabeza
del
mar
safely
across
a
damp
night
cabo
negro
again
we
had
a
short
march
to
make
next
day
and
it
was
nearly
noon
therefore
when
started
off
on
his
usual
morning
task
of
driving
up
the
horses
in
the
evening
as
one
may
rely
on
their
not
straying
very
far
the
horses
are
turned
loose
after
being
unsaddled
in
fact
no
other
method
would
be
practicable
for
if
they
were
kept
picketed
during
the
night
they
would
not
be
able
to
graze
and
would
soon
become
useless
as
they
all
follow
the
one
is
always
sure
of
finding
them
together
even
should
they
stray
three
or
four
miles
in
the
night
which
although
it
does
occasionally
occur
is
quite
exceptional
that
however
this
necessity
of
leaving
the
horses
at
liberty
may
give
rise
to
considerable
inconvenience
and
possibly
bring
one
into
the
most
serious
dilemmas
we
had
an
opportunity
of
discovering
at
the
cost
of
some
anxiety
and
a
day
hard
labour
after
had
been
gone
about
an
hour
we
began
to
wonder
at
his
prolonged
absence
but
as
there
had
been
a
strong
breeze
during
the
night
it
was
very
probable
as
gregorio
suggested
that
the
horses
had
wandered
some
distance
in
search
of
a
sheltered
valley
but
another
hour
elapsed
and
still
did
not
appear
guillaume
and
françois
then
went
off
in
different
directions
to
continue
the
search
agreeing
to
light
a
fire
should
either
of
them
sight
the
horses
we
in
the
meantime
were
left
a
prey
to
very
disagreeable
reflections
though
as
yet
we
had
no
strong
grounds
for
fearing
the
worst
we
kept
an
anxious
watch
for
the
first
signs
of
smoke
especially
in
the
direction
had
taken
as
he
must
have
covered
five
or
six
miles
by
the
time
he
had
been
gone
to
our
dismay
he
presently
turned
up
however
very
tired
and
footsore
without
having
seen
a
trace
of
the
horses
anywhere
matters
now
began
to
look
really
serious
but
we
still
comforted
ourselves
with
the
hope
that
françois
or
guillaume
would
be
more
successful
but
they
too
after
a
time
came
back
bringing
the
same
dismal
story
the
situation
looked
gloomy
a
hundred
suppositions
were
hazarded
as
to
what
could
have
become
of
the
horses
said
he
had
cut
the
trail
on
the
side
he
had
taken
without
success
and
guillaume
and
françois
having
done
the
same
it
was
clear
that
the
only
direction
in
which
the
horses
could
have
gone
was
over
the
plain
at
the
back
of
our
camp
though
what
could
have
induced
them
to
leave
the
pasturage
of
the
valley
for
the
barren
upland
it
was
hard
to
understand
meanwhile
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
immediately
make
search
for
them
in
that
direction
though
our
prospects
of
finding
them
seemed
small
indeed
should
we
not
do
so
we
should
have
to
accomplish
the
rest
of
our
journey
to
sandy
point
on
foot
we
had
eaten
our
last
round
of
guanaco
meat
that
morning
so
that
a
four
days
walk
on
empty
stomachs
apart
from
being
an
unpleasant
undertaking
was
one
which
it
was
a
question
whether
our
powers
were
equal
to
compassing
we
might
it
is
true
opportunely
meet
some
trader
on
the
way
from
whom
we
might
obtain
provisions
but
on
the
other
hand
we
might
not
be
so
fortunate
and
on
the
principle
that
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
we
were
justified
in
considering
the
latter
contingency
as
the
probable
one
we
commenced
our
task
therefore
with
feelings
the
reverse
of
cheerful
leaving
storer
in
the
camp
we
all
went
on
to
the
plain
and
started
off
in
different
directions
towards
the
distant
hills
that
bound
it
a
fire
should
any
of
us
be
successful
was
to
immediately
communicate
the
news
to
the
others
with
my
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
eagerly
scanning
it
for
any
trace
of
a
hoof
mark
i
walked
slowly
along
occasionally
giving
a
glance
over
the
plain
in
the
hopes
of
seeing
the
welcome
column
of
smoke
rise
up
into
the
air
but
time
went
on
and
my
hopes
of
success
grew
fainter
and
fainter
gregorio
had
expressed
a
fear
that
the
horses
had
got
on
to
the
indian
trail
to
sandy
point
and
taking
to
it
had
gone
off
at
a
trot
towards
cabo
negro
on
whose
pastures
they
were
at
home
or
aquerenciado
as
the
natives
say
the
possibility
of
their
having
done
so
assumed
more
and
more
the
feature
of
a
probability
as
hour
after
hour
passed
and
i
was
still
only
across
the
plain
and
no
traces
of
the
objects
of
my
search
as
yet
forthcoming
in
fact
it
seemed
useless
to
continue
plodding
on
farther
and
instinctively
i
broke
off
and
turned
to
the
left
observing
that
there
the
plain
ended
in
a
hilly
country
where
although
had
assured
us
he
had
searched
in
that
direction
it
certainly
seemed
more
likely
that
the
horses
would
be
supposing
they
had
not
gone
to
sandy
point
it
was
a
happy
inspiration
of
mine
i
had
not
gone
half
a
dozen
yards
down
a
grassy
ravine
before
turning
a
sharp
bend
i
suddenly
came
upon
the
whole
troop
quietly
grazing
at
their
ease
in
supreme
indifference
as
to
the
trouble
and
anxiety
they
had
caused
half
a
dozen
human
beings
for
the
last
five
or
six
hours
my
first
step
was
to
throw
a
few
lighted
matches
into
the
long
dry
grass
which
i
left
to
do
their
work
and
then
by
dint
of
some
patience
and
cunning
i
managed
to
persuade
one
of
the
tamest
horses
to
allow
me
to
get
my
arm
round
its
neck
and
effect
its
capture
improvising
a
kind
of
bridle
from
my
scarf
i
mounted
and
driving
the
horses
together
conveyed
them
towards
the
camp
not
a
little
proud
and
elated
at
my
achievement
which
was
due
rather
to
good
fortune
than
judgment
for
had
i
followed
out
the
plan
of
search
we
had
agreed
upon
who
knows
what
the
upshot
would
have
been
meanwhile
the
matches
had
had
due
effect
fanned
by
the
breeze
the
fire
spread
quickly
and
soon
the
ravine
was
ablaze
across
its
whole
breadth
a
mighty
column
of
smoke
being
whirled
high
into
the
air
carrying
doubtless
intense
relief
into
the
hearts
of
my
companions
who
were
still
toiling
over
the
plains
i
soon
got
to
the
camp
with
my
charges
and
was
thankful
to
be
able
to
lie
down
and
rest
after
my
exertions
one
by
one
the
others
dropped
in
and
as
may
be
imagined
we
were
all
equally
elated
at
so
fortunate
an
issue
of
a
which
might
have
had
the
most
serious
consequences
just
on
the
eve
too
of
the
conclusion
of
a
trip
otherwise
particularly
free
from
dangerous
mishaps
it
was
too
late
to
set
out
that
afternoon
so
we
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
trying
to
shoot
some
duck
for
supper
in
the
pleasure
of
finding
our
horses
again
we
were
not
disposed
to
grumble
at
minor
hardships
and
cheerfully
therefore
we
endeavoured
to
make
as
good
a
supper
off
a
brace
of
small
duck
which
was
all
we
could
kill
as
eight
hungry
people
might
be
expected
to
do
after
a
cup
of
coffee
next
morning
we
drew
our
belts
a
little
tighter
and
set
out
keeping
a
sharp
on
the
forlorn
chance
of
an
ostrich
coming
within
coursing
distance
but
during
the
whole
of
that
day
march
neither
beast
nor
fowl
save
a
fox
or
two
showed
itself
and
as
our
appetites
which
we
had
kept
in
tolerable
subjection
during
daytime
began
loudly
to
assert
themselves
towards
sundown
the
spirit
which
reigned
among
us
was
by
no
means
a
cheerful
one
we
were
just
discussing
the
faint
probability
that
existed
of
our
meeting
an
indian
trader
before
reaching
the
colony
when
suddenly
we
descried
a
man
riding
along
the
trail
towards
us
and
driving
two
horses
before
him
with
a
unanimous
shout
of
delight
we
all
galloped
forward
to
meet
this
welcome
stranger
on
whose
provisions
we
meant
to
make
a
friendly
but
extensive
raid
but
to
our
astonishment
on
perceiving
us
he
suddenly
drew
up
his
horse
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
dashed
away
over
the
pampa
without
stopping
to
inquire
what
could
be
the
motive
of
such
extraordinary
behaviour
and
seeing
only
that
our
chance
of
supper
was
vanishing
as
fast
as
four
legs
could
carry
it
we
all
clapped
spurs
to
our
steeds
and
galloped
after
him
with
as
much
alacrity
as
he
had
shown
the
harder
we
went
the
more
he
urged
his
horse
along
occasionally
looking
back
in
a
state
of
evident
terror
for
five
minutes
or
so
this
strange
continued
neither
pursued
nor
pursuers
gaining
any
ground
on
one
another
but
then
we
gradually
drew
nearer
to
our
quarry
whose
horse
was
already
beginning
to
show
signs
of
distress
we
were
soon
within
earshot
and
called
loudly
on
him
to
stop
saying
that
we
were
friends
whether
he
heard
us
or
not
i
do
know
but
the
effect
of
our
shouting
was
that
he
redoubled
his
efforts
and
for
a
time
the
chase
again
became
doubtful
but
we
were
not
to
be
beat
curiosity
to
know
this
man
motives
for
running
away
from
us
as
if
we
were
wild
beasts
combined
with
an
equally
strong
desire
to
obtain
some
provisions
from
the
amply
filled
which
were
gliding
along
in
front
of
us
kept
us
to
our
work
and
we
felt
that
till
our
horses
dropped
this
queer
quarry
must
be
followed
the
spurt
he
had
put
on
soon
died
away
and
then
we
crept
up
to
him
again
wild
with
excitement
and
giving
vent
to
some
sounding
which
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
may
have
possibly
increased
the
terrors
of
the
poor
man
situation
but
everything
comes
to
an
end
even
a
stern
chase
and
soon
gregorio
was
within
ten
or
twelve
yards
of
the
unknown
párase
amigo
soy
gregorio
he
called
out
several
times
and
at
last
feeling
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
man
did
stop
in
a
second
or
two
we
were
all
up
more
or
less
breathless
with
the
run
the
man
with
whom
gregorio
was
now
rapidly
conversing
in
spanish
looked
very
pale
and
frightened
at
first
but
gradually
the
expression
on
his
face
brightened
as
he
listened
to
gregorio
explanations
and
eventually
he
even
began
to
smile
we
meanwhile
eager
to
know
the
solution
of
the
mystery
pressed
gregorio
to
solve
it
it
appeared
that
this
man
was
a
convict
who
had
escaped
from
sandy
point
two
days
before
and
having
requisitioned
two
government
horses
was
now
on
his
way
to
the
santa
cruz
river
on
the
other
side
of
which
he
would
be
free
from
pursuit
when
he
saw
us
coming
towards
him
at
a
gallop
he
had
been
seized
with
a
sudden
panic
thinking
we
might
want
to
capture
him
and
had
galloped
off
with
the
results
known
of
course
we
could
not
ask
for
any
of
his
provisions
as
he
would
require
them
much
more
than
we
should
so
after
exchanging
a
few
words
with
him
we
left
him
and
proceeded
to
rejoin
storer
who
had
remained
behind
with
the
horses
whilst
we
had
been
engaged
on
our
novel
hunt
the
incident
furnished
us
with
matter
for
conversation
for
a
time
but
it
was
not
long
before
we
came
back
to
the
more
important
topic
of
food
for
we
were
now
all
of
us
really
faint
with
hunger
and
our
prospects
of
getting
anything
for
the
next
hours
were
faint
indeed
our
goal
that
evening
was
the
cabeza
del
mar
an
arm
of
the
sea
which
runs
for
some
distance
inland
and
which
at
a
certain
point
is
fordable
at
low
water
if
the
wind
is
not
blowing
strongly
from
an
unfavourable
direction
as
we
rode
along
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
itself
a
welcome
sight
and
forgetting
our
hunger
for
a
moment
we
gave
a
loud
cheer
at
about
seven
just
as
it
was
getting
dark
we
arrived
at
the
cabeza
del
mar
we
found
that
we
should
not
be
able
to
ford
it
for
four
or
five
hours
and
as
we
were
anxious
to
get
to
cabo
negro
as
soon
as
possible
in
order
to
break
our
prolonged
fast
we
decided
on
passing
that
night
rather
than
wait
till
next
morning
having
relieved
the
packhorses
of
their
loads
we
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
brewed
some
coffee
with
the
last
spoonfuls
that
remained
to
us
of
that
comfort
and
having
drunk
it
nothing
remained
for
us
but
to
wait
and
dream
of
the
meal
we
meant
to
devour
on
the
first
opportunity
we
tried
to
snatch
a
nap
but
few
of
us
succeeded
in
doing
so
as
hunger
kept
us
awake
and
so
the
hours
dragged
their
slow
length
wearily
along
whilst
we
sat
and
waited
for
the
tide
to
serve
to
add
to
the
discomforts
of
our
plight
the
sky
covered
over
and
the
rain
began
to
fall
and
the
night
got
so
dark
that
we
almost
thought
we
should
not
be
able
to
cross
over
however
the
time
came
when
we
thought
the
tide
ought
to
serve
and
we
rode
down
to
the
water
to
inspect
matters
occasionally
a
moonbeam
breaking
through
the
thick
allowed
us
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
rocks
in
the
middle
of
the
water
and
our
guides
were
thus
able
to
judge
the
right
moment
for
making
the
attempt
there
was
as
they
said
just
the
possibility
of
the
water
not
being
quite
low
enough
to
enable
us
to
cross
without
more
or
less
of
a
ducking
and
besides
in
the
darkness
the
leader
might
mistake
the
way
and
a
false
step
would
land
us
into
a
rocky
bottom
where
we
might
flounder
hopelessly
about
and
in
all
probability
get
unhorsed
and
god
knows
what
besides
these
considerations
served
to
make
us
feel
rather
uncomfortable
when
the
moment
arrived
for
us
to
commit
ourselves
to
the
chances
that
might
be
awaiting
us
in
the
dark
mass
of
water
which
swept
eddying
swiftly
past
us
and
but
for
the
acute
pangs
of
hunger
we
should
certainly
have
deferred
the
experiment
until
daytime
but
no
time
was
to
be
lost
so
ranging
in
single
file
behind
who
was
acting
as
guide
we
started
the
other
horses
with
guillaume
and
gregorio
driving
them
following
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
a
great
deal
of
splashing
and
shouting
incidental
on
the
objections
shown
by
the
packhorses
to
take
the
water
but
soon
they
were
all
in
and
fairly
on
their
way
then
came
a
few
seconds
silence
as
we
drew
into
deep
water
every
one
cautiously
following
his
leader
so
as
to
be
able
to
rein
in
in
time
should
the
latter
come
to
grief
suddenly
gave
a
cry
and
through
the
darkness
we
could
dimly
see
him
floundering
about
his
horse
having
evidently
lost
footing
after
splashing
about
for
some
seconds
however
he
got
all
right
again
and
calling
out
to
us
to
keep
more
to
the
left
he
moved
on
the
water
was
now
up
to
our
knees
and
at
each
step
it
got
deeper
but
fortunately
our
horses
still
kept
their
footing
and
soon
the
worst
was
over
and
the
bank
was
reached
without
any
mishap
having
occurred
all
the
dogs
had
remained
on
the
other
side
crying
and
yelling
in
a
gloomy
concert
as
they
saw
us
leaving
them
behind
but
as
soon
as
they
saw
us
ride
up
on
to
the
plain
they
plunged
into
the
water
and
swam
over
in
no
time
after
having
counted
the
horses
and
examined
their
packs
which
had
all
got
well
drenched
as
we
ourselves
had
we
continued
our
ride
with
the
intention
of
marching
the
whole
night
so
as
to
arrive
at
cabo
negro
in
the
morning
for
we
were
now
positively
frantic
with
hunger
for
a
time
notwithstanding
the
intense
darkness
we
managed
to
get
along
pretty
well
but
presently
we
found
that
we
had
got
off
the
trail
somehow
and
we
had
to
stop
whilst
the
guides
blundered
about
in
the
darkness
searching
for
it
then
after
we
had
got
on
to
it
once
more
the
horses
shied
at
a
big
white
stone
lying
on
the
road
and
bolted
in
all
directions
and
of
course
had
to
be
got
together
again
a
task
which
involved
nearly
an
hour
delay
apart
from
these
mishaps
our
progress
was
necessarily
so
slow
owing
to
the
darkness
that
we
at
last
came
to
the
conclusion
that
after
all
it
would
be
better
to
halt
where
we
were
and
proceed
at
daybreak
acting
on
this
determination
we
immediately
unsaddled
and
too
tired
to
put
up
the
tents
rolled
ourselves
up
in
our
furs
and
slept
or
tried
to
sleep
till
morning
i
think
this
was
the
unpleasantest
night
of
the
whole
trip
faint
with
hunger
drenched
and
cold
i
could
not
get
repose
although
i
felt
as
tired
and
jaded
as
could
possibly
be
the
ground
too
where
we
were
camped
was
stony
and
hillocky
and
when
at
the
first
sign
of
dawn
i
crept
out
of
my
furs
my
bones
were
so
stiff
that
i
could
with
difficulty
move
my
companions
being
all
in
an
equally
bad
plight
but
we
were
in
good
spirits
for
all
that
four
hours
riding
would
bring
us
to
the
wood
of
cabo
negro
and
there
we
should
get
food
in
abundance
never
had
the
horses
been
so
quickly
saddled
and
packed
as
on
that
morning
within
half
an
hour
from
commencing
operations
we
were
already
cantering
along
the
trail
scaling
the
brow
of
a
steep
hill
we
came
in
view
of
the
familiar
landscape
the
straits
and
the
cordilleras
and
not
far
off
the
black
patches
of
beechwood
round
cabo
negro
and
nestling
amid
them
the
little
on
whose
stores
we
projected
a
determined
raid
my
brother
and
now
rode
ahead
in
order
to
have
something
ready
against
our
arrival
after
two
or
three
hours
sharp
riding
they
reached
the
and
without
speaking
a
word
rushed
off
to
the
kitchen
and
laid
their
hands
on
and
utterly
devoured
what
was
to
have
been
the
breakfast
of
the
farmer
and
his
family
the
farmer
appeared
on
the
scene
just
as
they
had
swallowed
the
last
mouthful
and
it
appears
being
no
doubt
used
to
such
strange
visits
seemed
less
surprised
than
one
would
have
imagined
to
see
two
dirty
men
sitting
uninvited
in
his
kitchen
who
between
them
had
calmly
demolished
the
morning
meal
of
a
whole
household
having
thus
satisfied
their
own
immediate
wants
they
applied
themselves
to
catering
for
ours
and
to
such
good
purpose
that
by
the
time
we
reached
our
old
camp
under
the
beeches
of
cabo
negro
we
found
a
good
fire
already
blazing
half
a
sheep
hanging
on
a
tree
ready
for
roasting
and
such
stores
of
bread
eggs
and
other
provisions
as
made
our
eyes
glisten
and
our
mouths
water
how
we
feasted
need
not
be
told
i
think
very
little
of
that
half
sheep
remained
to
be
warmed
up
for
supper
and
most
of
the
other
provisions
shared
a
similar
speedy
fate
chapter

civilisation
again
our
disreputable
appearance
pucho
missing
the
coming
of
pucho
pucho
characteristics
we
had
still
three
days
to
wait
till
the
date
for
the
arrival
of
the
steamer
and
as
we
by
no
means
liked
the
idea
of
having
to
pass
them
in
sandy
point
we
resolved
to
remain
at
cabo
negro
for
a
couple
of
days
more
and
only
get
into
the
colony
in
time
to
settle
with
our
guides
and
make
ourselves
look
a
little
civilised
against
going
on
board
but
as
we
were
naturally
most
anxious
to
get
our
correspondence
my
brother
rode
into
sandy
point
to
fetch
it
he
returned
bringing
a
bagful
of
letters
and
newspapers
and
we
devoted
a
whole
afternoon
to
their
perusal
and
to
discussing
their
contents
these
letters
seemed
to
bring
us
back
to
the
world
again
to
the
world
and
its
almost
forgotten
responsibilities
pains
and
pleasures
which
but
the
day
before
had
seemed
as
remote
to
us
as
if
we
had
quitted
the
earth
altogether
and
were
living
in
some
other
planet
how
many
things
seemed
to
have
happened
since
we
had
been
away
and

in
these
events
was
magnified
hearing
of
them
as
we
did
thousands
of
miles
away
from
home
after
so
long
an
absence
occurrences
which
in
the
bustle
and
noise
of
ordinary
existence
would
hardly
have
excited
more
than
few
exclamations
of
surprise
or
scarcely
a
passing
thought
now
seemed
to
assume
the
most
important
proportions
and
were
discussed
at
inordinate
length
and
with
the
keenest
interest
there
was
a
letter
from
the
gamekeeper
telling
with
interminable
prosiness
how
cleverly
he
had
surprised
in
flagrante
delicto
the
man
whom
he
had
long
and
so
wisely
suspected
of
poaching
how
notwithstanding
every
care
on
his
part
the
severe
winter
had
proved
too
much
for
a
favourite
old
setter
and
thanks
to
his
efforts
how
extraordinary
a
number
of
pheasants
there
was
in
the
copses
etc
another
from
the
head
with
intelligence
of
a
similar
nature
from
his
department
lengthy
documents
from
the
agent
telling
how
one
tenant
could
pay
his
rent
how
another
would
though
he
could
how
one
lot
of
cottages
required
repairing
and
how
advantageous
to
the
property
if
a
fresh
lot
were
built
the
peculiarity
of
all
these
epistles
being
the
predominance
of
the
bad
over
the
good
news
then
were
letters
telling
how
had
married
and
the
very
last
woman
one
would
have
thought
too
how
had
got
a
divorce
and
no
wonder
one
might
have
seen
that
all
along
how
had
gone
off
to
shoot
big
game
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
how
had
merely
gone
and
shot
himself
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
every
trivial
item
affording
us
a
goodly
space
for
lengthy
gossip
a
luxury
which
since
our
departure
for
the
plains
had
so
signally
failed
us
it
is
only
when
unable
to
indulge
in
it
that
we
find
what
an
important
factor
the
and
small
talk
of
ordinary
life
is
in
general
conversation
there
were
several
papers
too
in
our
budget
and
we
devoured
their
old
intelligence
with
no
less
avidity
and
eagerness
than
that
with
which
we
had
perused
our
letters
that
day
passed
and
the
next
and
then
the
hour
came
for
us
to
saddle
up
once
more
and
ride
in
to
sandy
point
as
may
be
imagined
this
time
we
did
not
jog
along
behind
the
leaving
these
to
the
care
of
the
guides
to
come
on
at
their
leisure
we
cantered
merrily
on
alone
along
the
familiar
path
by
the
shore
of
the
straits
as
the
huts
of
sandy
point
came
in
sight
we
began
to
realise
that
at
last
we
were
getting
back
to
civilisation
and
prospectively
to
england
and
already
plans
of
what
we
were
to
do
on
arriving
home
were
formed
and
discussed
there
was
only
one
night
more
to
pass
before
setting
foot
on
board
the
steamer
which
was
to
take
us
back
to
the
world
but
so
impatient
were
we
that
even
that
short
time
seemed
all
too
long
and
we
wondered
if
it
ever
would
pass
soon
we
were
trotting
along
the
streets
of
sandy
point
and
reaching
pedro
house
dismounted
and
found
ourselves
under
a
roof
once
more
pedro
advised
of
our
coming
had
prepared
breakfast
for
us
and
without
more
ado
we
sat
down
to
it
we
handled
our
knives
and
forks
very
awkwardly
at
first
it
required
almost
an
effort
to
eat
in
a
civilised
manner
and
accustomed
of
late
to
take
our
meals
in
a
recumbent
position
we
by
no
means
felt
very
comfortable
in
our
chairs
and
now
for
the
first
time
the
scales
fell
from
our
eyes
and
the
sight
of
the
clean
and
neat
room
caused
us
to
become
aware
of
our
own
personal
appearance
and
the
enviable
giftie
was
ours
of
seeing
ourselves
as
others
saw
us
the
sight
was
certainly
not
a
delectable
one
our
looks
and
garments
were
not
out
of
keeping
with
our
late
life
in
the
pampas
but
surrounded
by
cleanliness
and
civilisation
they
were
decidedly
out
of
place
we
had
performed
our
ablutions
as
often
and
as
thoroughly
as
circumstances
would
permit
but
they
had
not
permitted
much
the
men
of
our
party
particularly
were
unpleasant
to
look
at
their
hair
had
grown
long
and
elfin
their
faces
were
tanned
to
a
dark
which
the
dust
and
the
smoke
from
the
had
deepened
into
well
black
and
their
unshaven
chins
were
disfigured
by
a
profuse
growth
of
coarse
stubble
our
clothes
did
not
bear
close
inspection
the
blood
of
many
a
guanaco
the
grease
of
many
an
the
thorn
of
many
a
califaté
bush
had
left
their
marks
and
altogether
a
more
ruffianly
disreputable
lot
than
we
looked
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
but
hot
water
soap
and
razors
and
a
change
of
raiment
did
wonders
and
when
after
several
hours
hard
work
we
met
again
we
were
scarcely
able
to
recognise
one
another
we
passed
the
day
in
settling
with
the
guides
and
in
packing
up
our
few
traps
in
anticipation
of
the
arrival
of
the
steamer
early
next
morning
feeling
tired
i
went
to
sleep
early
but
the
comfort
i
expected
from
lying
between
sheets
again
was
by
no
means
vouchsafed
me
and
the
soft
mattress
and
cool
sheets
instead
of
inviting
slumber
seemed
to
frighten
it
away
i
felt
half
inclined
to
get
up
and
go
to
sleep
on
the
floor
however
my
eyes
closed
at
last
and
from
a
dream
in
which
i
was
once
more
chasing
the
ostrich
in
sight
of
the
memorable
cleopatra
peaks
i
was
awakened
by
dunsmuir
banging
at
my
door
telling
me
that
the
steamer
had
arrived
and
that
it
was
time
to
be
off
i
jumped
up
and
dressed
hurriedly
and
found
all
the
others
ready
to
go
on
board
the
luggage
had
already
been
put
into
a
boat
and
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
done
but
to
say
to
our
guides
and
walk
down
to
the
jetty
to
embark
i
had
only
one
regret
on
leaving
sandy
point
the
day
we
arrived
at
cabo
negro
one
of
our
dogs
called
pucho
who
was
rather
a
favourite
of
mine
and
whom
i
wished
to
take
with
me
to
england
was
suddenly
missing
pucho
a
peculiar
dog
had
joined
us
under
peculiar
circumstances
at
our
camp
at
laguna
larga
we
were
quietly
sitting
round
the
after
dinner
when
suddenly
the
dogs
jumped
up
and
began
to
bark
furiously
at
some
unseen
enemy
we
got
up
and
peered
out
into
the
dusk
but
could
see
nothing
though
it
was
evident
that
something
there
was
for
the
growls
of
our
dogs
increased
in
earnestness
and
fury
every
instant
a
puma
suggested
somebody
but
our
horses
were
grazing
quietly
so
it
could
not
be
a
puma
an
indian
or
some
trader
perhaps
was
another
equally
unfounded
surmise
what
could
it
be
here
as
if
to
settle
the
mystery
at
once
the
dogs
all
rushed
out
of
one
accord
and
for
a
few
moments
we
could
hear
a
terrible
snarling
and
growling
going
on
in
the
distance
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
the
cause
of
the
commotion
was
explained
surrounded
by
our
dogs
who
were
giving
it
a
by
no
means
friendly
welcome
a
strange
dog
walked
slowly
towards
the
it
bore
its
tail
between
its
legs
seeming
to
crave
admission
into
our
circle
its
humble
demeanour
however
only
bore
reference
to
for
the
defiant
manner
in
which
it
occasionally
bared
its
white
teeth
and
turned
on
our
dogs
whenever
they
came
too
near
showed
that
it
cared
little
for
them
we
called
out
in
friendly
tones
and
this
settled
its
bearing
for
once
and
for
all
it
turned
round
made
one
savage
dash
at
one
or
two
of
its
tormentors
and
then
calmly
made
its
way
towards
the
fire
looked
out
for
the
most
comfortable
spot
stretched
itself
leisurely
and
lay
down
with
its
head
resting
on
its
crossed
paws
seemingly
as
much
at
home
as
if
it
had
known
us
all
its
life
i
ventured
to
stroke
it
but
my
advances
were
received
in
a
most
unfriendly
and
considering
its
position
of
alien
outcast
audaciously
impertinent
manner
for
it
snapped
viciously
at
me
but
from
the
first
pucho
as
we
called
him
made
it
a
point
of
distinctly
refusing
to
be
patronised
he
joined
us
he
gave
us
to
understand
not
on
sufferance
not
as
a
suppliant
for
our
favours
not
as
a
guest
even
but
as
an
equal
and
this
status
he
claimed
as
regards
us
only
for
as
to
our
dogs
he
ignored
them
completely
though
willing
as
subsequently
appeared
to
make
use
of
their
good
services
he
looked
sleek
and
fat
a
circumstance
which
led
us
to
think
highly
of
his
powers
of
speed
as
it
is
by
no
means
easy
for
a
dog
to
run
down
a
guanaco
singly
and
most
dogs
who
lose
their
master
as
this
dog
had
evidently
done
soon
die
of
starvation
we
therefore
congratulated
ourselves
on
his
arrival
as
we
hoped
he
would
be
able
to
afford
our
own
dogs
help
in
the
chase
but
we
had
grievously
reckoned
without
our
host
the
next
day
on
the
march
a
guanaco
was
sighted
close
to
us
now
was
the
time
choo
choo
pucho
we
shouted
expecting
to
see
him
speed
out
like
an
arrow
after
the
guanaco
but
nothing
could
have
been
further
from
his
thoughts
he
looked
first
at
us
and
then
at
the
guanaco
for
a
moment
not
without
interest
perhaps
but
certainly
without
showing
the
slightest
inclination
to
hostile
demonstration
then
with
another
look
at
us
which
said
as
plainly
as
words
could
well
that
a
guanaco
no
doubt
but
what
then
he
quietly
trotted
on
we
were
very
angry
at
seeing
our
hopes
deceived
besides
being
surprised
at
his
extraordinary
demeanour
but
gregorio
giving
the
dog
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
said
that
perhaps
it
had
only
been
trained
to
run
ostriches
as
indians
frequently
teach
their
dogs
to
do
this
seemed
plausible
enough
and
our
confidence
in
pucho
was
momentarily
restored
presently
an
ostrich
started
up
now
then
choo
choo
pucho
was
the
excited
cry
again
all
the
other
dogs
flew
out
like
the
wind
after
the
bird
and
pucho
followed
them
but
only
at
a
trot
and
apparently
merely
to
judge
how
the
other
dogs
behaved
for
he
soon
stopped
and
contented
himself
with
watching
the
chase
till
it
disappeared
from
view
and
then
he
leisurely
came
back
to
his
usual
post
at
my
horse
heels
everybody
was
enraged
with
him
francisco
suggested
that
being
a
bouche
inutile
pucho
should
be
knocked
on
the
head
with
the
bolas
but
i
could
not
hear
of
this
and
life
was
spared
and
so
he
remained
with
us
and
i
had
ample
opportunities
for
studying
his
peculiar
character
as
on
the
first
day
so
he
continued
although
generally
there
or
thereabouts
when
a
distribution
of
the
spoils
took
place
he
never
once
helped
the
dogs
in
the
chase
that
this
did
not
arise
from
inability
or
want
of
speed
but
rather
from
a
sense
of
his
own
superior
dignity
was
shown
by
the
fact
of
his
once
having
been
seen
to
pursue
and
catch
a
fox
a
feat
none
of
our
other
dogs
were
capable
of
amongst
other
peculiarities
he
had
a
way
of
mysteriously
disappearing
if
the
day
march
was
too
long
where
is
pucho
was
a
frequent
cry
and
thank
god
he
gone
at
last
was
an
ejaculation
often
heard
on
these
occasions
but
so
sure
as
the
for
dinner
was
done
to
a
turn
the
soup
ready
and
the
fire
blazing
comfortably
so
sure
would
pucho
suddenly
appear
on
the
scene
look
out
for
the
most
cosy
spot
near
the
fire
and
cheerfully
await
his
supper
as
if
nothing
had
happened
when
therefore
he
was
missing
at
cabo
negro
i
took
little
notice
thinking
he
would
be
sure
to
turn
up
but
came
and
no
pucho
nor
did
he
appear
again
even
when
we
went
on
to
sandy
point
this
was
the
thought
that
was
troubling
me
as
i
walked
down
to
the
pier
for
i
had
taken
a
liking
to
this
dog
or
i
had
better
say
i
held
him
in
reverential
awe
for
i
think
he
would
object
himself
to
the
term
like
as
savouring
of
patronage
half
absently
therefore
before
going
down
the
ladder
into
the
boat
i
turned
round
to
take
a
last
look
for
pucho
surely
that
is
a
dog
coming
down
the
street
i
thought
as
i
looked
up
and
right
enough
it
was
a
dog
and
what
is
more
pucho
himself
there
was
no
mistaking
the
calm
mien
the
leisurely
trot
he
picked
his
way
along
the
battered
pier
half
wagged
his
tail
as
he
saw
me
a
great
condescension
and
then
without
a
moment
hesitation
led
the
way
down
the
ladder
into
the
boat
much
to
the
surprise
of
my
companions
who
had
thought
and
hoped
that
they
had
really
seen
the
last
of
him
i
took
him
or
rather
he
came
to
england
me
and
as
i
write
this
he
is
sitting
in
the
cosiest
corner
by
my
fire
a
privilege
he
allows
my
pet
terrier
to
share
with
him
an
act
very
foreign
to
his
usual
nature
and
one
for
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
account
so
here
we
are
on
board
at
last
we
say
to
dunsmuir
the
anchor
is
weighed
the
screw
goes
round
and
we
are
off
sandy
point
disappears
from
view
one
by
one
cape
negro
and
cape
gregorio
are
passed
and
before
i
know
it
so
engrossed
am
i
in
the
thoughts
that
crowd
into
my
mind
at
the
sight
of
these
points
we
are
abreast
of
cape
virgins
it
fades
again
astern
there
is
no
land
on
either
side
and
patagonia
bleak
and
silent
and
solemn
with
the
days
we
spent
on
its
mysterious
shores
is
behind
us
as
i
write
these
days
come
vividly
to
my
mind
again
and
in
fancy
i
once
more
behold
that
distant
desert
land
the
land
of
the
lonely
plains
where
the
guanaco
and
the
ostrich
and
the
red
indians
roam
far
from
the
ken
of
mankind
and
where
i
spent
a
careless
happy
time
which
i
can
never
forget
i
remember
the
days
when
after
a
long
and
weary
ride
i
slept
pillowed
on
my
saddle
the
open
sky
above
me
a
sounder
and
sweeter
sleep
than
i
had
ever
slept
before
i
remember
those
grand
where
we
traced
the
wild
horse
to
his
home
through
beechwood
glens
by
lonely
lakes
by
mountain
torrents
where
no
mortal
foot
had
ever
trod
before
me
i
remember
many
an
exciting
chase
and
many
a
pleasant
evening
spent
round
the
cheery
i
remember
too
many
a
discomfort
the
earthquake
the
drenching
rains
the
scorching
sun
the
pitiless
mosquitoes
and
the
terrible
blasting
winds
but
from
the
pleasure
with
which
i
look
back
on
my
wild
life
in
patagonia
these
unpleasant
memories
can
detract
but
little
taking
it
all
in
all
it
was
a
very
happy
time
and
a
time
on
whose
like
i
would
gladly
look
