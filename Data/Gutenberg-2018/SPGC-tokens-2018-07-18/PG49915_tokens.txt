preface
many
a
tale
of
blood
and
tears
has
come
to
us
of
late
from
far
euphrates
and
from
the
regions
round
about
it
is
not
so
much
the
aim
of
the
following
pages
to
tell
these
over
again
as
to
show
the
light
that
even
there
shines
through
the
darkness
i
do
set
my
bow
in
the
cloud
is
true
of
the
densest
most
awful
cloud
of
human
misery
as
in
the
early
ages
of
christianity
what
little
child
what
tender
woman
was
there
who
did
not
clasp
the
cross
with
a
light
laugh
or
wrap
the
burning
robe
round
thanking
god
as
in
later
times
of
no
less
fervent
faith
men
took
each
hands
and
walked
into
the
fire
and
women
sang
a
song
of
triumph
while
the
gravedigger
was
shovelling
the
earth
over
their
living
faces
so
now
in
our
own
days
there
still
walks
in
the
furnace
with
his
faithful
servants
one
like
unto
the
son
of
god
every
instance
of
faith
or
heroism
given
in
these
pages
is
not
only
true
in
itself
but
typical
of
a
hundred
others
the
tale
is
told
however
feebly
and
inadequately
to
strengthen
our
own
faith
and
quicken
our
own
love
it
is
told
also
to
stir
our
own
hearts
to
help
and
save
the
remnant
that
is
left
the
past
is
past
and
we
can
not
change
it
now
but
we
can
still
save
from
death
or
from
fates
worse
than
death
the
children
of
christian
parents
who
are
helpless
and
desolate
orphans
because
their
parents
christians
and
true
to
the
faith
they
professed
and

name
they
loved

the
dark
river
a
thousand
streams
of
lovelier
flow
bathed
his
own
native
land
the
eastern
sun
was
near
its
setting
everywhere
beneath
its
beams
stretched
out
a
vast
dreary
campaign
pale
yellowish
brown
with
low
rolling
hills
bare
of
vegetation
there
was
scarcely
anything
upon
which
the
eye
of
man
could
rest
with
interest
or
satisfaction
except
one
little
clump
of
plane
trees
beside
which
a
party
of
travellers
had
spread
their
tents
they
had
spent
the
day
in
repose
for
they
intended
to
spend
the
night
in
travelling
since
although
summer
was
past
and
autumn
had
come
the
heat
was
still
great
the
tent
in
the
centre
of
the
little
encampment
was
occupied
by
an
englishman
and
his
son
to
whom
all
the
rest
were
but
guides
or
servants
or
guards
the
syrians
the
arabs
and
the
turkish
zaptiehs
who
filled
these
offices
were
resting
from
their
labours
having
tethered
their
horses
under
the
trees
it
was
about
time
for
them
to
be
stirring
now
to
attend
to
the
animals
to
make
the
coffee
and
to
do
other
needful
things
in
preparation
for
the
journey
but
they
were
used
to
wait
for
a
signal
from
their
master
for
the
time
being
grayson
or
grayson
effendi
as
they
generally
called
him
pending
this
they
saw
no
reason
to
shorten
their
repose
though
a
few
of
them
sat
up
yawned
and
began
to
take
out
their
tobacco
pouches
and
to
employ
themselves
in
making
cigarettes
presently
from
the
effendi
own
tent
a
slight
boyish
form
emerged
and
trod
softly
through
the
rest
hohannes
effendi
so
the
turks
and
arabs
called
him
as
a
kind
of
working
equivalent
for
master
john
was
a
bright
english
lad
in
his
sixteenth
year
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
white
drill
and
his
head
protected
by
a
kind
of
helmet
with
flaps
to
cover
the
cheeks
and
neck
since
the
glare
reflected
from
the
ground
was
almost
as
trying
as
the
scorching
heat
above
once
beyond
the
encampment
he
quickened
his
pace
and
fast
and
straight
as
an
arrow
flies
dashed
on
over
the
little
hills
due
eastwards
for
there
the
arabs
had
told
him
a
bow
shot
off
two
stones
throw
the
length
a
man
might
ride
while
he
said
his
ilaha
ill
allah
ran
the
great
river
waking
some
two
hours
before
from
the
profound
sleep
of
boyhood
he
had
not
been
able
to
close
his
eyes
again
for
the
longing
that
came
over
him
to
look
upon
it
for
this
was
that
ancient
river
last
of
the
mystic
four
that
watered
the
flowers
of
eden
witness
of
ruined
civilizations
survivor
of
dead
empires
the
old
historic
euphrates
not
that
all
this
was
present
to
the
mind
of
young
john
grayson
but
he
had
caught
from
his
father
whose
constant
companion
he
was
a
reflected
interest
in
places
where
things
happened
which
was
transfigured
by
the
glamour
of
a
young
imagination
on
and
on
he
went
for
the
wide
featureless
monotonous
landscape
deceived
his
eye
and
the
river
was
really
much
farther
than
he
thought
he
got
amongst
tall
reeds
which
sometimes
hindered
his
view
though
often
he
could
see
over
them
well
enough
if
there
had
been
anything
to
see
except
more
reeds
mixed
with
a
little
rank
grass
more
low
hills
and
over
all
a
cloudless
purple
sky
the
one
point
of
relief
was
the
dark
spot
in
the
distance
that
meant
as
he
knew
the
trees
from
which
he
had
started
he
thought
two
or
three
times
of
turning
back
not
from
weariness
and
certainly
not
from
fear
except
the
fear
that
his
father
might
wonder
what
had
become
of
him
but
being
a
young
englishman
he
did
not
choose
to
be
beaten
and
so
he
went
on
at
last
there
reached
his
ears
what
seemed
a
dull
low
murmur
but
what
was
in
fact
the
sound
of
a
great
river
on
its
way
to
the
sea
while
at
the
same
time
the
scent
of
water
far
away
upon
the
breeze
was
flung
he
hurried
on
now
over
a
grassy
place
now
through
tall
thick
reeds
until
at
last
emerging
from
a
mass
of
them
he
found
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
steep
precipitous
bank
and
lo
the
euphrates
rolled
beneath
him
he
could
have
cried
aloud
in
his
surprise
and
disappointment
was
this
indeed
the
great
euphrates
the
grand
beautiful
river
he
had
come
to
see
had
this
indeed
flowed
through
paradise
this
dull
muddy
most
unlovely
stream
dark
dark
it
looked
as
he
stood
and
gazed
down
into
its
turbid
waters
dark
he
said
to
himself
no
it
is
not
dark
it
is
and
the
longer
he
gazed
the
blacker
and
the
drearier
it
grew
why
stay
any
longer
by
this
ugly
old
stream
for
so
he
called
it
there
was
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
see
he
turned
to
go
back
and
then
the
whole
scene
in
its
loneliness
and
desolation
took
a
sudden
grip
of
his
young
soul
the
awe
and
wonder
of
the
great
silent
solitary
space
overcame
him
the
river
instead
of
being
a
voice
amidst
the
stillness
a
living
thing
amidst
the
death
around
was
only
another
death
it
seemed
to
flow
from
some
waste
land
where
no
man
comes
or
hath
come
since
the
making
of
the
world
then
all
at
once
by
a
very
common
trick
of
fancy
young
john
grayson
found
himself
at
home
at
home
really
in
happy
england
his
mother
dead
a
year
ago
was
there
still
he
saw
her
room
the
table
with
her
books
and
work
and
her
favourite
clock
upon
it
a
shawl
she
used
to
wear
of
some
blue
shimmering
stuff
like
silk
he
saw
her
face
and
then
as
suddenly
all
was
gone
he
knew
that
she
was
dead
and
he
stood
alone
with
the
silent
sky
the
desolate
earth
the
gloomy
river
an
atom
of
life
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
dead
world
before
he
knew
it
the
tears
were
on
his
cheek
this
would
never
do
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
though
there
was
no
one
there
to
see
dashing
the
disgraceful
drops
aside
he
started
at
a
run
to
go
back
after
a
time
he
stopped
in
a
space
fairly
clear
of
reeds
to
look
about
him
he
could
see
in
the
distance
the
clump
of
trees
that
marked
the
camping
place
but
it
looked
very
far
off
the
low
hills
confused
him
it
would
not
be
such
an
easy
matter
as
he
thought
to
return
he
sat
down
to
rest
a
little
for
disappointment
and
discouragement
made
him
feel
suddenly
very
tired
but
he
soon
sprang
to
his
feet
again
with
a
shout
a
familiar
sound
reached
his
ear
the
long
australian
which
his
father
had
adopted
as
the
most
penetrating
kind
of
call
he
gave
back
the
cry
with
all
the
strength
of
his
lungs
and
waved
his
handkerchief
high
in
the
air
presently
he
saw
his
father
coming
towards
him
through
the
reeds
followed
by
two
of
the
arabs
he
ran
to
him
in
high
delight
his
sad
reflections
gone
into
the
vast
limbo
that
engulfs
boyish
sorrows
father
father
i
have
found
euphrates
yes
my
boy
but
had
some
trouble
to
find
they
stood
together
son
and
father
in
that
great
solitude
as
in
a
sense
they
did
also
in
the
greater
solitude
of
the
world
the
father
was
one
of
those
men
of
whom
it
is
impossible
to
say
he
belongs
to
such
and
such
a
type
or
he
is
cast
in
such
and
such
a
mould
rather
was
he
as
by
the
great
artist
own
chisel
he
was
tall
spare
wiry
with
a
cheek
as
brown
as
southern
skies
could
make
it
dark
hair
and
beard
showing
early
threads
of
grey
dark
eyes
full
of
fire
and
a
mouth
as
sensitive
as
a
woman
the
boy
had
inherited
his
mother
blue
eyes
and
fair
hair
but
he
was
very
like
his
father
both
in
expression
and
in
the
cast
of
his
features
especially
the
shape
of
his
forehead
and
the
moulding
of
his
fine
mouth
and
chin
slight
as
was
the
shadow
of
rebuke
conveyed
by
his
father
words
he
felt
it
it
was
so
rare
he
said
simply
i
am
sorry
did
you
think
euphrates
worth
the
trouble
when
you
found
it
asked
his
father
who
had
seen
the
and
disappointing
river
long
ago
very
much
the
reverse
father
an
uglier
muddier
blacker
kind
of
a
river
i
never
saw
i
suppose
we
are
quite
close
to
it
i
will
go
on
and
have
a
look
as
there
is
no
hurry
about
our
start
stay
here
if
you
are
tired
with
one
of
the
arabs
i
will
come
back
with
you
i
should
like
it
come
along
then
a
short
walk
brought
them
to
the
bank
the
two
arabs
following
at
a
respectful
distance
stately
and
indifferent
the
sun
was
setting
now
and
behold
a
wonder
met
their
eyes
the
dark
stream
was
transfigured
as
if
by
the
wand
of
an
angel
it
poured
rejoicing
on
its
way
a
torrent
of
liquid
gold
for
it
had
taken
to
its
heart
of
hearts
all
the
glory
of
the
setting
sun
and
gave
it
back
to
the
beholder
in
a
marvel
of
radiance
so
might
look
to
mortal
eyes
the
river
of
god
the
river
of
the
water
of
life
that
runs
through
the
shining
streets
of
the
new
jerusalem
the
boy
uttered
a
cry
of
wonder
and
delight
the
father
gazed
in
silence
at
last
he
said
the
dark
river
turns
to
but
come
my
boy
he
added
presently
before
the
sun
sets
let
us
take
away
with
us
in
memory
this
look
of
the
euphrates
chapter
ii
father
and
son
i
can
not
rest
from
travel
i
will
drink
life
to
the
lees
while
the
travellers
go
back
to
their
encampment
now
in
full
preparation
for
the
start
it
may
be
well
to
introduce
them
formally
by
name
in
this
respect
they
were
exactly
alike
the
father
name
in
full
was
john
frederick
pangbourne
grayson
and
so
was
the
son
his
friends
however
generally
called
him
john
johnnie
or
jack
by
preference
the
latter
which
was
his
father
custom
also
john
frederick
pangbourne
had
made
himself
remarkable
in
early
life
as
a
bold
adventurous
traveller
going
into
places
and
amongst
peoples
little
known
to
the
rest
of
the
world
he
was
in
perils
of
many
kinds
often
great
sometimes
desperate
but
he
always
came
through
thanks
to
his
cool
courage
his
quickness
of
resource
his
tact
in
dealing
with
men
and
last
but
not
least
his
abounding
sympathy
and
kindness
so
other
men
said
he
himself
said
simply
if
any
one
spoke
of
his
dangers
and
deliverances
i
got
out
of
it
or
they
went
away
or
they
did
me
no
harm
as
the
case
might
be
for
he
feared
god
and
though
he
did
not
go
out
of
his
way
to
tell
it
to
the
world
he
was
quite
willing
for
the
world
to
know
it
beside
the
of
the
englishman
which
is
as
strong
or
stronger
than
the
of
the
celt
pangbourne
had
another
motive
in
his
wanderings
he
was
smitten
to
the
heart
with
love
and
longing
for
brown
greek
or
mss
in
any
other
ancient
tongue
he
had
already
made
a
find
or
two
chiefly
of
early
copies
or
part
copies
of
the
old
christian
apologists
but
these
only
whetted
his
appetite
for
more
he
had
heard
of
mss
to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mount
ararat
and
was
purposing
to
go
in
search
of
them
when
two
events
changed
his
plans
he
got
a
fortune
and
he
married
a
wife
as
he
was
a
younger
son
the
family
acres
had
gone
of
course
to
his
elder
brother
ralph
pangbourne
a
squire
in
one
of
the
midland
counties
not
that
they
brought
him
any
great
wealth
for
he
suffered
like
others
from
the
economic
changes
of
the
time
there
was
a
heavy
mortgage
on
his
property
and
his
family
was
large
and
expensive
therefore
he
was
not
particularly
rejoiced
when
miss
matilda
grayson
a
distant
connection
of
the
family
left
her
large
fortune
to
his
younger
brother
instead
of
to
himself
however
as
there
was
the
condition
attached
of
assuming
the
name
of
grayson
she
may
well
have
thought
that
the
representative
of
the
pangbourne
family
would
not
choose
to
comply
but
i
wish
she
had
given
the
chance
to
one
of
my
boys
thought
ralph
pangbourne
frederick
as
he
was
usually
called
by
his
kinsfolk
behaved
with
great
liberality
he
cleared
off
the
mortgage
and
virtually
adopted
one
of
his
brother
children
his
and
namesake
still
the
fortune
was
his
but
it
would
not
have
kept
him
in
england
if
he
had
not
about
the
same
time
met
his
fate
while
visiting
one
of
the
universities
in
the
daughter
of
a
learned
professor
who
was
interested
in
his
archæological
researches
the
course
of
true
love
in
this
instance
falsified
the
proverb
he
bought
a
pleasant
country
seat
in
the
south
of
england
and
settled
down
to
the
life
of
an
english
gentleman
quiet
years
followed
and
if
even
in
his
happy
home
he
sometimes
felt
the
stings
of
a
longing
for
wider
horizons
and
more
stirring
scenes
at
least
he
told
of
them
to
none
one
son
and
only
one
was
born
to
him
after
some
fifteen
happy
years
his
wife
died
very
suddenly
no
man
ever
mourned
his
dead
more
truly
but
it
was
inevitable
that
when
the
first
pangs
of
bereavement
died
into
a
dull
aching
he
should
long
to
resume
his
wandering
life
some
special
studies
which
he
had
been
making
when
the
great
calamity
overtook
him
gave
definiteness
to
his
plans
his
fancy
had
been
caught
by
the
old
legend
of
agbar
king
of
edessa
of
his
letter
to
our
lord
and
the
answer
fabrications
though
they
manifestly
are
an
idea
possessed
him
that
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
ancient
edessa
agbar
fair
little
city
so
early
christianized
mss
might
be
found
dating
perhaps
from
the
first
century
the
thought
gave
an
object
to
his
proposed
wanderings
in
the
east
for
to
the
east
his
heart
was
ever
drawn
by
strong
mystic
yearning
and
if
his
dreams
should
prove
only
dreams
there
was
no
duty
now
which
forbade
him
to
pursue
them
one
duty
indeed
he
had
the
care
of
his
boy
always
much
attached
in
the
days
of
their
bereavement
son
and
father
drew
very
close
together
everybody
advised
him
to
leave
jack
at
school
but
everybody
spoke
to
deaf
ears
for
jack
entreated
him
to
take
him
with
him
and
his
own
heart
echoed
the
plea
after
all
why
not
he
was
a
strong
healthy
lad
very
manly
and
full
of
bright
intelligence
might
not
foreign
travel
be
the
best
of
schools
for
him
to
jack
the
prospect
seemed
the
most
delightful
ever
unfolded
before
mortal
eyes
grayson
could
well
afford
every
luxury
of
travel
that
might
ensure
safety
and
preserve
health
had
he
been
alone
he
would
have
cheerfully
faced
many
risks
and
inconveniences
to
which
he
did
not
care
to
expose
his
son
so
far
they
had
journeyed
in
great
comfort
keenly
enjoying
the
adventure
they
expected
next
morning
to
reach
a
little
town
on
the
euphrates
called
biridjik
where
they
proposed
to
rest
for
a
day
or
two
arranging
as
they
always
did
in
such
circumstances
for
the
use
of
a
room
or
rooms
in
some
comfortable
house
the
journey
by
night
in
that
land
where
night
never
means
darkness
was
delicious
the
moon
was
at
the
full
and
bathed
in
beauty
even
the
desolate
monotonous
landscape
its
light
was
quite
enough
for
all
travelling
purposes
it
seemed
indeed
only
a
softer
cooler
and
more
genial
day
early
morning
found
them
on
the
stretch
of
road
leading
to
the
river
at
the
other
side
was
a
sort
of
natural
amphitheatre
a
picturesque
hill
rose
in
terraces
from
the
river
near
its
summit
the
ruins
of
a
castle
a
wall
which
had
once
belonged
to
the
castle
formed
a
bow
of
which
the
river
was
the
string
and
which
enclosed
the
little
town
with
its
houses
orchards
and
gardens
on
each
side
of
their
road
as
they
drew
near
the
river
was
a
large
turkish
full
of
upright
tombstones
all
very
narrow
and
some
of
them
very
high
then
came
a
solitary
and
a
small
rude
khan
around
it
and
down
to
the
river
brink
gathered
a
noisy
shouting
vociferous
crowd
oh
such
a
crowd
jack
thought
there
were
camels
from
aleppo
with
their
heavy
burdens
and
their
swearing
screaming
drivers
khartijes
or
muleteers
with
their
laden
mules
stately
arabs
zaptiehs
in
uniforms
stolid
and
indifferent
amidst
the
turmoil
kourds
with
horses
and
donkeys
and
dresses
of
every
colour
of
the
rainbow
jack
was
especially
amused
with
a
kourdish
woman
who
joined
the
throng
with
two
little
donkeys
which
she
belaboured
vigorously
with
a
short
club
her
lord
and
master
sitting
the
while
upon
one
of
them
content
and
passive
but
even
this
sight
lost
its
interest
when
he
thought
he
discovered
in
the
distance
some
one
on
horseback
in
a
european
dress
and
beside
him
wonderful
vision
what
looked
like
a
european
lady
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
but
now
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
river
floating
swiftly
down
stream
with
only
a
stroke
or
two
from
the
paddles
of
the
came
two
enormous
wooden
boats
each
in
shape
like
a
woman
shoe
then
began
a
regular
stampede
the
whole
disorderly
crowd
wanting
to
get
in
at
once
and
fearing
to
be
left
behind
as
soon
as
the
boats
touched
the
land
the
rush
became
frantic
it
was
like
bedlam
the
men
pushing
swearing
shouting
the
animals
who
objected
strongly
to
the
whole
proceeding
being
urged
on
by
their
furious
or
frightened
drivers
to
the
peril
of
all
within
reach
of
them
jack
got
separated
from
his
father
and
carried
nearly
off
his
feet
but
he
found
himself
at
last
in
one
of
the
boats
which
was
swaying
horribly
from
side
to
side
the
terrified
horses
jammed
together
in
a
narrow
space
were
kicking
biting
and
squealing
and
the
shrieks
and
curses
of
their
drivers
were
not
likely
to
soothe
them
some
of
these
had
dismounted
others
kept
their
seats
jack
saw
one
of
their
own
zaptiehs
pushed
against
the
side
of
the
boat
and
thought
he
would
be
killed
but
he
called
on
allah
and
used
his
fists
manfully
and
in
a
minute
or
two
had
extricated
himself
and
was
sitting
safely
on
the
bulwark
jack
climbed
up
beside
him
anxious
to
see
where
his
father
was
and
soon
discovered
him
near
the
other
end
of
the
boat
helping
to
keep
the
frightened
animals
under
control
it
was
impossible
however
to
reach
him
through
the
throng
looking
back
he
saw
the
other
boat
quite
close
there
amidst
the
crowd
of
men
and
horses
stood
the
english
lady
as
jack
supposed
her
a
tall
slight
figure
holding
the
bridle
of
her
horse
he
saw
the
look
of
terror
in
the
creature
face
the
ears
laid
back
the
nostrils
quivering
and
red
as
fire
he
was
going
mad
he
would
bite
or
trample
her
no
she
had
snatched
off
her
veil
and
quick
as
thought
tied
it
over
his
eyes
the
situation
was
saved
and
jack
was
gratified
by
a
moment
vision
of
a
girlish
face
very
fair
very
young
and
crowned
with
clustering
golden
hair
then
the
boats
changed
position
and
he
lost
it
after
half
an
hour
swaying
and
joggling
they
all
got
safe
to
the
other
side
then
there
was
more
noise
and
confusion
and
then
they
found
themselves
slowly
ascending
the
steep
irregular
flights
of
stone
steps
that
formed
the
streets
of
biridjik
here
jack
caught
a
last
glimpse
of
his
lady
of
the
golden
hair
now
decorously
veiled
and
seated
on
her
horse
very
unsafely
as
he
feared
for
she
looked
in
danger
of
falling
off
over
his
tail
at
every
step
he
took
in
the
perilous
ascent
but
the
party
to
which
she
belonged
went
on
at
once
upon
their
journey
while
the
graysons
remained
in
biridjik
chapter
iii
first
impressions
manners
are
not
idle
but
the
fruit
of
loyal
nature
and
of
noble
mind
young
john
grayson
stood
alone
in
the
large
upper
room
which
had
been
assigned
to
him
and
to
his
father
grayson
had
gone
out
to
reward
and
dismiss
the
zaptiehs
and
the
arabs
and
to
make
arrangements
about
the
syrian
servants
whom
he
meant
to
keep
with
him
but
jack
was
looking
for
his
return
every
moment
to
partake
of
the
breakfast
which
had
been
just
brought
in
first
a
stool
had
been
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
then
a
metal
tray
much
larger
set
upon
it
handsome
embroidered
cushions
placed
beside
showed
where
and
how
the
guests
were
expected
to
sit
except
these
cushions
and
a
few
rugs
or
small
carpets
the
only
furniture
the
room
contained
was
a
divan
running
along
the
side
covered
with
turkey
red
and
adorned
with
white
embroidered
cloths
there
were
also
some
beds
or
mattrasses
folded
up
in
a
niche
in
the
wall
and
a
few
articles
belonging
to
the
travellers
had
been
brought
and
left
in
the
room
there
were
several
windows
large
and
very
close
together
jack
stood
at
one
of
them
and
looked
out
on
the
courtyard
round
which
the
house
was
built
in
the
form
of
a
hollow
square
there
must
be
a
great
many
rooms
he
thought
and
wondered
if
one
family
occupied
them
all
the
court
looked
gay
and
pleasant
with
late
crocuses
a
few
fruit
trees
and
best
of
all
a
little
stream
of
living
water
flowing
right
through
it
and
filling
the
air
with
its
cheery
murmuring
but
the
eyes
of
the
hungry
boy
soon
turned
back
to
the
table
where
they
rested
approvingly
upon
a
remarkably
good
breakfast
there
was
a
dish
of
pillav
made
of
a
preparation
of
wheat
called
with
boiling
butter
poured
over
it
and
upon
the
pillav
a
fowl
lay
in
state
as
the
best
part
of
the
banquet
there
was
bread
in
large
cakes
thin
as
wafers
and
folded
together
like
napkins
there
was
a
great
copper
vessel
lined
with
something
that
looked
like
silver
and
filled
with
a
kind
of
cold
sour
boiled
milk
and
there
was
a
pitcher
of
tempting
pink
sherbet
with
glasses
to
drink
it
from
jack
gave
a
little
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
ejaculated
wish
father
would
come
before
the
fowl
gets
cold
grayson
came
looking
white
and
weary
a
thing
unusual
with
him
let
us
have
our
breakfast
father
jack
said
i
am
sure
you
are
starving
i
am
his
exploits
on
the
fowl
went
far
to
prove
it
but
his
father
gave
him
little
assistance
you
do
eat
father
he
said
i
am
not
hungry
though
the
sun
is
up
such
a
little
while
it
has
contrived
to
give
me
a
headache
i
shall
sleep
it
off
want
a
sleep
too
as
your
eyes
are
crying
out
not
a
bit
of
them
father
i
could
not
sleep
now
i
want
to
go
out
and
see
this
queer
old
place
i
sleep
all
the
better
when
i
come
back
well
do
so
but
take
care
of
the
sun
and
get
one
of
the
servants
to
go
with
you
you
will
find
them
about
somewhere
grayson
spoke
with
a
dull
listless
air
quite
foreign
to
his
brisk
energetic
nature
he
is
very
sleepy
jack
thought
as
he
put
on
his
protective
and
ran
cheerfully
down
into
the
court
he
looked
about
for
the
servants
but
could
not
see
either
of
them
as
he
was
standing
there
an
open
door
attracted
his
eye
and
he
could
not
help
looking
in
a
woman
was
baking
bread
in
an
oven
consisting
of
a
large
round
hole
in
the
clay
floor
of
the
middle
of
the
room
she
was
taking
small
pieces
of
dough
from
a
lump
beside
her
slapping
them
on
the
inside
of
the
oven
and
promptly
removing
those
already
baked
sufficiently
two
little
boys
were
playing
quietly
at
some
game
on
the
ground
and
an
older
lad
was
standing
beside
her
talking
apparently
about
a
bundle
of
cotton
in
a
cloth
which
he
held
by
the
four
corners
raising
her
eyes
for
a
moment
from
her
oven
and
her
dough
the
woman
saw
the
stranger
at
the
door
he
did
not
know
a
word
of
armenian
nor
she
a
word
of
english
but
she
saluted
him
with
great
courtesy
bowing
almost
to
the
ground
then
as
she
rose
slowly
touching
her
heart
her
lips
and
her
forehead
the
children
did
the
same
the
youngest
acting
his
little
part
so
prettily
that
jack
fell
in
love
with
him
on
the
spot
as
the
woman
by
signs
invited
him
to
enter
he
did
so
and
the
children
placed
a
cushion
for
him
in
the
corner
farthest
from
the
door
the
older
boy
brought
him
sherbet
flavoured
and
tinted
with
rosewater
this
is
all
very
nice
thought
jack
still
when
one
pays
a
visit
one
is
expected
to
talk
and
how
can
i
talk
to
people
who
do
know
a
word
of
my
language
nor
i
a
word
of
theirs
he
tried
to
solve
the
difficulty
by
introducing
himself
patting
his
own
breast
and
forehead
and
repeating
john
john
grayson
an
experiment
attended
with
only
partial
success
his
new
friends
learning
to
call
him
yon
effendi
then
he
pulled
out
his
schoolboy
silver
watch
for
their
edification
the
two
little
boys
who
stood
gazing
at
him
with
their
great
black
eyes
evidently
thought
he
was
a
far
greater
wonder
himself
but
the
elder
looked
at
it
intelligently
as
one
who
perfectly
knew
its
use
he
tried
next
to
get
at
their
names
pointing
to
each
in
turn
with
a
look
of
inquiry
as
well
as
he
could
make
out
the
unfamiliar
sounds
he
thought
the
eldest
boy
called
himself
something
like
kevork
the
second
was
certainly
gabriel
the
youngest
probably
hagop
he
took
little
brown
hand
in
his
own
large
one
whereupon
the
child
stooped
down
kissed
the
hand
that
held
his
and
touched
it
with
his
forehead
fearing
that
he
was
interrupting
the
baking
operations
he
soon
rose
to
go
he
happened
to
notice
a
picture
on
the
wall
or
rather
a
coloured
daub
in
staring
blue
red
and
green
representing
an
impossible
warrior
running
an
impossible
sword
through
the
heart
of
a
monster
three
or
four
times
as
large
as
himself
seeing
him
look
at
it
the
woman
and
the
eldest
boy
began
an
explanation
in
which
he
could
only
distinguish
one
of
the
names
he
had
just
heard
kevork
he
thought
they
meant
that
it
belonged
to
kevork
and
did
not
find
out
until
long
afterwards
that
kevork
is
one
of
the
armenian
forms
of
george
and
that
he
had
lighted
upon
a
picture
of
the
patron
saint
of
his
own
land
slaying
the
traditional
dragon
he
left
his
new
friends
after
a
silent
exchange
of
courtesies
and
forgetting
all
about
the
servants
he
ought
to
have
looked
for
began
to
descend
the
crooked
winding
steps
or
streets
that
led
down
to
the
river
presently
he
heard
a
patter
of
feet
behind
him
and
looking
back
saw
gabriel
trotting
after
him
the
child
came
up
and
held
out
to
him
a
little
roll
of
something
yellow
with
what
looked
like
the
kernels
of
nuts
in
it
it
was
evidently
to
be
eaten
for
gabriel
smiling
pointed
to
his
mouth
so
jack
sat
down
on
one
of
the
steps
and
made
his
first
acquaintance
with
the
armenian
delicacy
called
a
preparation
of
grape
sugar
into
which
the
kernels
of
nuts
are
sometimes
put
he
liked
it
at
first
but
it
soon
palled
and
he
began
to
fancy
it
was
making
him
sick
whatever
was
the
cause
a
strange
faintness
and
dizziness
came
over
him
as
he
sat
there
by
the
river
it
is
too
hot
here
he
thought
i
must
go
back
he
got
up
but
found
it
a
hard
matter
to
keep
his
feet
twice
or
thrice
as
he
toiled
up
the
steps
he
was
obliged
to
sit
down
and
rest
little
gabriel
had
stayed
beside
him
and
he
was
very
glad
of
it
as
without
a
guide
he
would
almost
certainly
have
missed
the
gate
of
the
house
where
their
quarters
were
since
all
the
houses
built
in
the
same
way
about
their
looked
so
exactly
alike
feeling
worse
every
minute
he
stumbled
up
the
stairs
threw
the
door
open
and
got
into
the
room
just
in
time
to
fall
down
in
a
faint
when
he
came
to
himself
he
was
lying
on
one
of
the
beds
and
his
father
stooping
anxiously
over
him
put
a
glass
to
his
lips
from
which
he
drank
obediently
how
do
you
feel
now
my
son
he
asked
oh
all
right
jack
said
i
do
know
what
came
over
me
down
there
by
the
river
i
suppose
it
was
the
sun
but
i
am
better
i
can
get
up
do
lie
still
and
give
me
your
hand
i
want
to
feel
your
pulse
jack
gave
it
father
he
said
looking
up
your
own
hand
is
shaking
is
there
anything
wrong
not
much
i
hope
you
are
a
little
hot
and
feverish

jack

with
cold
i
ca
keep
still
the
dose
was
administered
and
jack
following
his
father
movements
with
his
eyes
noticed
that
he
took
one
himself
also
now
my
boy
he
said
you
have
not
slept
for
nearly
four
and
twenty
hours
and
you
spent
all
last
night
in
the
saddle
unless
you
take
a
good
rest
you
may
be
ill
lie
as
quiet
as
you
can
and
try
to
sleep
i
will
father
but
i
so
thirsty
his
father
gave
him
some
sherbet
and
covered
him
up
comfortably
with
a
silk
rug
then
he
sat
down
and
took
out
his
and
pencil
but
he
wrote
only
a
few
words
in
a
faint
irregular
hand
difficult
to
decipher
have
heard
from
jacob
my
syrian
that
the
plain
we
have
just
traversed
is
noted
for
its
deadly
malaria
is
in
fact
a
perfect
hotbed
of
fever
i
fear
john
has
it
after
some
time
jack
dropped
off
into
a
troubled
doze
strange
dreams
came
to
him
ending
usually
in
some
catastrophe
that
made
him
start
up
in
sudden
fright
once
he
thought
he
was
walking
by
the
river
and
somehow
lost
his
footing
and
fell
in
he
woke
up
with
a
cry
the
water
is
so
cold
so
dark
his
father
was
at
his
side
and
soothed
him
do
you
remember
he
said
the
dark
river
turns
to
light
but
as
soon
as
the
boy
was
quiet
and
at
rest
again
john
grayson
added
one
more
to
the
records
in
his
and
it
was
almost
illegible
we
have
both
caught
the
fever
god
help
us
if
i
can
i
will
arrange
chapter
iv
a
new
life
among
new
men
strange
faces
other
minds
after
that
for
young
john
grayson
life
was
a
blank
dim
shadows
came
and
went
like
reflections
in
a
mirror
having
no
continuity
and
leaving
no
impression
in
a
passing
way
as
a
dumb
creature
might
he
felt
burning
heat
and
freezing
cold
pain
and
weariness
and
nameless
indescribable
distress
so
too
he
saw
forms
around
him
kind
people
who
gave
him
things
to
drink
and
spoke
to
him
in
words
he
could
not
understand
sometimes
he
was
conscious
of
a
sort
of
dull
relief
or
pleasure
when
they
cooled
his
burning
brow
with
snow
which
had
been
brought
from
the
mountains
packed
in
straw
and
carefully
preserved
but
throughout
all
he
missed
something
some
one
at
first
he
knew
that
he
wanted
his
father
and
used
to
call
for
him
piteously
but
this
passed
at
length
he
grew
too
weak
even
for
the
pain
of
longing
with
the
very
ill
as
with
the
very
old
desire
fails
yet
in
spite
of
all
he
crept
slowly
back
to
life
one
day
he
felt
himself
carried
somewhere
and
then
became
suddenly
conscious
of
a
delicious
coolness
after
what
seemed
a
lifetime
of
burning
heat
looking
up
presently
when
the
sense
of
fatigue
had
somewhat
passed
he
saw
that
he
was
lying
on
a
large
bedstead
like
one
of
our
old
in
the
open
air
there
were
white
curtains
all
around
him
which
were
being
softly
stirred
by
a
refreshing
breeze
while
over
his
head
no
roof
between
not
even
the
canvas
of
a
tent
glowed
the
deep
rich
blue
of
the
eastern
sky
he
was
on
the
for
a
while
after
that
he
recovered
more
quickly
but
the
hot
weather
coming
early
that
year
brought
on
a
sore
relapse
and
again
for
many
days
his
life
was
despaired
of
more
than
once
the
watchers
thought
he
was
actually
gone
and
often
they
thought
the
question
was
one
of
hours
yet
in
the
end
the
long
conflict
of
death
and
life
ended
in
the
victory
the
slow
uncertain
victory
of
the
latter
he
came
back
to
life
like
a
little
child
only
just
beginning
it
for
the
time
his
past
was
completely
blotted
out
too
weak
in
mind
and
body
for
connected
thought
he
accepted
the
things
about
him
without
question
he
seemed
to
have
been
always
there
amongst
those
people
who
sat
upon
the
ground
ate
rice
and
bulghour
and
wore
striped
zebouns
of
cotton
cloth
and
jackets
he
picked
up
their
speech
very
quickly
as
a
child
picks
up
his
mother
tongue
and
at
this
stage
did
not
remember
his
own
he
came
to
know
those
about
him
and
to
call
them
by
their
names
between
twenty
and
thirty
persons
dwelt
in
the
large
house
in
which
he
was
a
guest
but
they
were
all
one
family
the
sons
and
the
daughters
and
and
a
whole
tribe
of
the
grandchildren
of
a
patriarch
called
hohannes
meneshian
the
whole
household
were
jack
familiar
friends
but
he
loved
best
the
three
boys
who
had
been
his
first
acquaintances
and
their
mother
mariam
hanum
who
throughout
his
illness
had
been
his
devoted
nurse
he
liked
the
gentle
touch
of
her
hand
and
the
tenderness
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
sometimes
he
called
her
mya
mother
as
the
boys
did
of
the
three
kevork
gabriel
and
little
hagop
gabriel
was
his
favourite
indeed
the
child
was
like
his
shadow
waiting
on
him
continually
and
often
bringing
him
beautiful
flowers
gorgeous
pomegranate
blossoms
or
roses
of
many
kinds
and
of
most
exquisite
perfume
or
he
would
bring
him
fruit
delicious
grapes
pears
plums
and
peaches
or
sometimes
he
would
just
steal
silently
up
to
kiss
his
hand
and
touch
it
with
his
forehead
or
stand
or
sit
quietly
beside
him
there
was
one
thing
that
soothed
him
inexpressibly
though
like
all
else
it
was
accepted
without
question
or
comprehension
when
mariam
and
the
other
women
went
about
the
household
tasks
that
as
he
grew
better
he
liked
to
watch
they
would
say
hesoos
ockna
menk
jesus
help
us
when
they
finished
they
would
say
park
derocha
praise
the
lord
in
everything
there
was
devout
acknowledgment
of
god
and
the
sweetest
of
all
names
that
are
named
in
heaven
or
upon
earth
was
often
on
their
lips
spoken
with
reverence
and
love
something
that
for
john
grayson
still
lived
on
in
the
purple
twilight
under
the
sea
of
conscious
thought
made
this
very
grateful
to
him
and
joined
it
with
what
were
like
the
first
heavenward
thoughts
and
prayers
of
a
little
child
so
time
passed
on
but
as
he
grew
stronger
there
awoke
again
within
him
a
vague
sense
of
want
and
longing
he
had
no
power
to
express
his
feelings
but
he
felt
something
was
wrong
with
him
he
was
not
in
his
proper
place
or
was
it
rather
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
all
the
people
about
him
they
were
very
kind
but
they
and
their
ways
had
a
queer
distorted
unnatural
look
in
his
eyes
like
the
things
one
sees
reflected
in
the
bowl
of
a
spoon
he
longed
continually
longed
inexpressibly
for
something
he
could
not
get
for
some
one
who
was
not
there
yet
he
could
not
tell
who
it
was
he
wanted
he
grew
silent
and
melancholy
and
his
friends
thought
him
in
danger
of
another
relapse
which
would
certainly
have
been
fatal
happily
it
was
now
autumn
again
the
sultriest
months
of
the
year
being
over
so
one
day
they
wrapped
him
up
carefully
seated
him
comfortably
on
cushions
upon
a
donkey
and
brought
him
with
them
to
a
vineyard
which
hohannes
possessed
on
a
slope
of
one
of
the
hills
above
biridjik
he
was
a
man
of
some
property
having
flocks
and
herds
also
the
great
luscious
grapes
as
large
as
plums
purple
green
and
amber
hung
in
ripe
profusion
nearly
breaking
down
the
low
bushes
they
grew
upon
jack
ate
of
them
to
his
heart
content
and
lay
in
the
pleasant
shade
of
a
watching
the
other
young
people
as
they
gathered
them
for
their
various
uses
tents
had
been
brought
and
it
gave
him
a
kind
of
dreamy
satisfaction
to
sleep
in
one
of
these
it
seemed
somehow
to
bring
him
nearer
to
the
things
he
had
lost
and
was
vaguely
feeling
after
often
hints
of
them
seemed
to
flash
on
him
unbidden
but
when
he
tried
to
grasp
them
vanished
as
they
came
leaving
him
confused
and
faint
with
a
fluttering
heart
and
an
aching
head
however
his
strength
improved
in
the
cooler
air
and
amidst
the
new
surroundings
he
had
soon
an
opportunity
of
testing
it
one
day
he
happened
to
be
by
himself
resting
under
his
favourite
when
he
heard
a
noise
as
of
something
trampling
and
tearing
the
vines
looking
up
he
saw
that
a
flock
of
goats
had
got
in
among
them
and
were
doing
terrible
damage
not
only
to
the
ripe
fruit
but
even
to
the
trees
he
got
up
and
called
for
help
but
no
one
heeded
and
he
supposed
no
one
heard
it
was
dreadful
to
see
all
this
harm
done
in
fact
he
could
not
endure
it
taking
heart
he
went
to
the
rescue
himself
or
rather
for
the
first
time
since
his
illness
he
his
steps
were
unsteady
his
limbs
shook
under
him
once
indeed
he
fell
but
he
was
up
and
on
again
in
a
moment
the
exercise
seemed
to
give
back
strength
to
his
muscles
and
vigour
to
his
brain
he
shouted
aloud
he
took
up
stones
and
flung
them
at
the
trespassers
sending
them
flying
over
the
low
stone
wall
then
the
englishman
joy
of
battle
waking
in
him
he
gave
chase
as
fast
or
faster
than
his
limbs
would
carry
him
he
heard
the
others
crying
out
to
him
but
he
thought
they
were
encouraging
his
efforts
even
when
they
came
running
up
with
evident
intent
to
stop
him
he
thought
they
were
only
afraid
he
would
do
himself
harm
but
at
last
the
youngest
son
of
hohannes
caught
him
bodily
in
his
arms
shook
the
stones
out
of
his
hand
and
cried
breathlessly
you
must
you
must
jack
had
a
good
deal
of
armenian
by
this
time
inchu
why
why
he
gasped
they
were
destroying
your
vines
the
young
man
by
name
avedis
or
good
tidings
looked
sadly
at
the
injured
trees
but
only
said
those
goats
belong
to
the
kourds
jack
stammered
in
his
eagerness
to
find
the
words
he
wanted
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
he
got
out
at
last
what
right
have
the
kourds
to
spoil
your
vines
do
you
know
yon
effendi
that
if
we
dare
to
stop
them
doing
it
or
even
to
drive
their
sheep
and
goats
out
of
our
fields
and
vineyards
they
think
a
great
deal
less
of
stabbing
or
shooting
one
of
us
than
you
would
of
killing
a
cat
but
then
they
would
be
hanged
for
it
cried
jack
have
you
no
oh
what
is
the
word
for
it
have
you
no
he
said
the
word
in
english
and
a
rush
of
old
new
thoughts
and
impressions
came
crowding
into
his
brain
the
men
who
keep
order
and
take
people
to
prison
do
you
mean
the
zaptiehs
they
are
worse
than
the
kourds
the
turk
and
the
kourd
are
the
upper
and
the
nether
millstone
grinding
us
to
powder
if
one
of
us
is
fool
enough
to
complain
of
a
kourd
or
a
turk
the
kamaikan
the
governor
i
mean
says
he
will
enquire
into
the
matter
and
he
does
he
sends
for
the
man
who
has
complained
throws
him
into
a
dungeon
and
keeps
him
there
till
he
confesses
all
the
wrong
is
on
his
own
side
or
perhaps
until
his
people
pay
a
sum
of
money
or
perhaps
he
may
be
never
heard
of
again
at
all
avedis
did
not
say
this
with
fierce
looks
and
indignant
gestures
but
in
a
calm
way
as
if
such
things
were
part
of
the
everlasting
order
of
nature
which
has
been
from
the
beginning
and
will
be
until
the
end
jack
did
not
follow
every
word
but
one
thing
he
understood
very
clearly
they
must
all
stand
still
and
see
their
beautiful
vines
destroyed
there
was
no
remedy
why
because
this
was
not
england
now
he
knew
everything
he
was
an
english
boy
left
alone
here
in
this
strange
land
and
his
father
where
was
his
father
where
is
my
father
he
cried
aloud
in
english
what
is
that
you
say
asked
avedis
jack
repeated
his
question
in
armenian
come
and
sit
down
under
the
tree
said
avedis
jack
obeyed
silent
and
trembling
avedis
stood
looking
at
him
sadly
tell
me
where
is
my
father
jack
repeated
with
pleading
eyes
into
which
a
new
expression
was
dawning
slowly
you
know
yon
effendi
you
have
been
very
ill
avedis
said
your
father
a
great
english
effendi
very
wise
and
good
was
ill
too
you
recovered
your
father
did
not
recover
he
is
gone
to
god
do
you
understand
me
yon
effendi
jack
understood
so
well
that
he
flung
himself
face
downwards
on
the
ground
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
weeping
in
vain
avedis
tried
to
comfort
him
god
forgive
me
he
thought
i
ought
not
to
have
told
him
i
fear
i
have
killed
him
and
he
certainly
had
not
acted
up
to
the
meaning
of
his
name
the
rest
of
the
family
blamed
him
severely
when
they
heard
what
he
had
done
it
was
the
custom
of
their
country
for
the
bearer
of
sad
tidings
to
go
about
his
task
with
great
circumlocution
carefully
breaking
them
as
we
say
in
england
yet
the
shock
instead
of
killing
john
grayson
brought
him
back
to
his
true
life
up
to
this
there
had
been
a
serious
danger
that
his
brain
would
never
wholly
recover
the
shock
of
that
long
and
terrible
illness
and
that
if
he
lived
he
might
go
through
the
future
years
as
one
whose
mind
had
an
important
leaf
left
out
of
it
but
that
day
agony
of
weeping
and
the
days
and
nights
of
distress
that
followed
it
meant
that
he
would
either
die
or
else
recover
wholly
and
claim
his
intellectual
inheritance
in
the
present
and
the
past
this
full
recovery
however
might
well
be
an
affair
of
time
perhaps
of
a
long
time
old
hohannes
heard
with
the
rest
that
the
english
youth
knew
now
that
his
father
was
dead
and
that
he
was
weeping
and
refusing
comfort
in
a
manner
very
likely
to
make
him
ill
again
we
will
take
him
back
to
the
town
he
said
and
so
they
did
the
next
day
the
following
morning
hohannes
took
him
by
the
hand
led
him
into
a
low
dark
room
on
the
where
bulghour
and
rice
were
stored
and
shut
and
barred
the
door
sit
down
he
said
jack
did
so
and
looked
on
wonderingly
while
the
old
man
dug
a
hole
in
the
ground
with
some
implement
resembling
a
trowel
at
last
he
grew
impatient
and
asked
will
you
not
tell
me
about
my
father
hohannes
looked
up
there
is
not
much
to
tell
he
said
feeling
himself
no
doubt
very
ill
the
english
effendi
sent
for
me
and
i
came
he
asked
me
to
take
care
of
you
and
if
you
should
recover
to
try
and
send
you
back
to
your
friends
in
england
and
he
gave
me
to
use
for
you
as
i
thought
best
the
things
i
have
kept
hidden
here
he
spoke
somewhat
also
of
certain
papers
but
before
he
could
finish
what
he
wanted
to
say
the
fever
increased
upon
him
and
his
mind
began
to
wander
as
to
the
papers
we
never
got
them
they
were
stolen
away
with
his
other
baggage
by
the
two
syrian
servants
who
were
brothers
and
precious
rascals
but
these
i
have
he
stooped
and
took
out
of
the
hole
something
wrapped
in
a
skin
and
tied
with
cords
these
he
carefully
unfastened
took
off
the
skin
and
revealed
two
books
and
a
belt
of
chamois
leather
the
books
he
gave
to
jack
who
recognised
with
a
thrill
of
joy
and
a
pang
of
sorrow
the
pocket
bible
his
father
always
carried
with
him
and
the
in
which
he
used
to
see
him
write
keep
these
thyself
said
hohannes
this
holding
up
the
belt
i
must
keep
still
there
is
gold
in
it
instinctively
his
voice
dropped
lower
though
there
was
none
to
hear
the
dangerous
word
i
am
very
glad
of
it
jack
said
frankly
as
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
him
that
these
people
upon
whom
he
had
no
claim
had
been
providing
for
all
his
wants
father
hohannes
you
and
yours
have
fed
and
tended
me
all
this
time
like
a
child
of
your
own
it
ought
to
be
all
yours
you
have
a
generous
heart
yon
effendi
and
in
fact
i
have
used
it
for
you
as
far
as
was
necessary
and
just
there
were
medicines
and
other
things
when
you
were
ill
and
there
was
the
tax
to
pay
for
you
the
tax
for
me
jack
repeated
what
tax
know
you
not
we
have
to
pay
year
by
year
every
man
and
boy
among
us
for
breathing
the
air
even
for
the
babe
the
turk
exacts
it
so
your
tax
had
to
be
found
along
with
our
own
and
will
be
next
year
also
moreover
i
own
a
piece
or
two
went
to
the
kourds
as
backsheesh
that
they
might
let
our
cattle
alone
indeed
father
jack
said
again
i
wish
you
would
take
it
all
it
is
yours
by
right
hohannes
shook
his
head
and
what
then
if
you
should
want
to
go
home
he
said
or
if
any
way
for
your
doing
it
should
open
moreover
we
dare
not
for
our
lives
let
any
one
know
we
have
so
much
gold
in
the
house
the
kourds
would
come
down
from
the
mountains
and
rob
us
or
the
turks
would
take
it
from
us
on
pretence
of
arrears
of
taxes
it
is
best
for
me
to
keep
it
here
for
you
you
see
where
i
put
it
yes
father
hohannes
it
is
all
right
said
jack
he
was
longing
to
go
away
somewhere
by
himself
and
feast
his
eyes
on
his
father
handwriting
and
on
the
printed
words
he
loved
so
well
but
as
he
was
going
a
thought
came
to
him
that
made
him
turn
again
things
which
he
had
heard
kevork
say
as
he
began
to
get
better
and
which
at
the
time
he
had
scarcely
noticed
came
to
his
mind
with
a
sudden
inspiration
father
hohannes
he
said
kevork
your
grandson
longs
sore
to
go
to
aintab
to
the
great
school
the
americans
have
set
up
there
for
your
people
kevork
loves
learning
very
much
may
he
not
take
some
of
this
gold
and
go
again
hohannes
shook
his
head
kevork
is
a
foolish
boy
he
said
the
cock
that
dreamed
of
grain
fell
from
his
perch
trying
to
scratch
for
it
let
him
stay
at
home
and
mind
the
cattle
or
take
to
the
weaving
if
it
like
him
better
jack
was
sorry
for
kevork
but
the
possession
of
the
precious
books
drove
everything
else
out
of
his
head
he
flew
upon
the
spoil
nor
was
it
with
a
passing
joy
alone
since
during
the
time
that
followed
the
chief
sustenance
of
his
life
that
which
made
it
worth
living
came
from
these
books
he
was
himself
again
but
only
a
childish
weak
discouraged
self
a
different
being
from
the
strong
energetic
lad
who
had
come
with
his
father
to
biridjik
his
illness
and
its
consequences
had
thrown
him
back
in
his
development
of
body
of
mind
and
still
more
of
character
for
at
least
a
couple
of
years
he
was
quite
unable
at
present
to
look
his
life
in
the
face
or
to
take
the
initiative
in
any
way
nor
was
there
any
one
about
him
who
could
give
him
effectual
help
how
to
go
to
england
was
a
problem
no
one
in
biridjik
seemed
able
to
solve
even
a
letter
was
a
difficult
and
doubtful
undertaking
it
is
true
the
town
possessed
a
turkish
but
this
at
all
events
for
foreign
letters
was
a
perfect
tomb
in
answer
to
his
questions
his
friends
told
him
of
a
certain
cousin
muggurditch
a
kinsman
of
hohannes
who
lived
at
yeatessa
but
was
a
great
traveller
going
sometimes
even
as
far
as
constantinople
he
could
send
a
letter
safely
to
england
jack
thought
yeatessa
was
the
place
his
father
wanted
to
go
to
and
which
was
mentioned
in
his
as
edessa
the
city
of
the
legendary
king
agbar
his
friends
assured
him
it
was
that
they
knew
all
about
it
and
that
the
story
of
king
agbar
was
quite
true
for
his
tomb
was
still
to
be
seen
just
outside
the
city
which
the
franks
called
urfa
and
which
was
only
two
days
journey
from
biridjik
i
shall
go
there
some
time
jack
said
but
he
said
no
more
about
it
and
it
seemed
as
if
for
the
time
all
thought
of
change
had
passed
out
of
his
mind
he
slipped
into
the
life
and
the
ways
of
those
about
him
even
his
european
clothes
were
or
and
he
adopted
the
striped
zeboun
the
gay
jacket
and
the
crimson
fez
of
the
armenians
mariam
hanum
mary
took
care
of
his
wardrobe
and
he
might
be
seen
every
saturday
going
with
the
other
men
and
youths
to
the
bath
and
carrying
his
clean
clothes
with
him
tied
up
in
a
towel
one
day
he
wanted
a
kerchief
to
put
under
his
fez
and
keep
off
the
sun
and
he
went
by
himself
to
the
shop
to
buy
it
he
came
back
with
one
of
bright
green
which
he
thought
very
handsome
but
to
his
amazement
kevork
snatched
it
from
his
head
and
avedis
flung
it
into
the
fire
with
the
approval
of
all
the
rest
do
you
know
that
green
is
the
moslem
colour
they
said
to
him
then
be
sure
i
will
never
wear
it
jack
answered
i
am
a
christian
he
went
with
his
friends
to
the
gregorian
church
on
sundays
and
feast
days
often
too
in
the
early
mornings
before
sunrise
or
in
the
evenings
at
sunset
it
is
true
he
did
not
understand
very
much
of
the
service
but
the
armenians
themselves
were
scarcely
better
off
as
the
ancient
armenian
language
is
still
used
in
the
liturgy
of
the
national
church
he
was
shown
in
the
adjoining
graveyard
the
of
his
father
marked
like
all
the
other
graves
with
a
flat
stone
then
he
printed
carefully
in
english
capital
letters
his
father
full
name
and
gave
it
to
the
best
stonecutter
in
the
town
asking
him
to
engrave
it
for
him
with
a
cross
i
should
like
it
put
upon
another
stone
he
said
one
to
stand
up
as
we
have
them
in
england
the
stonecutter
explained
that
he
could
not
have
it
here
it
was
unlawful
mahometans
had
their
tombstones
erect
but
a
christian
might
only
mark
the
of
his
dead
with
a
flat
stone
but
the
man
added
with
a
smile
that
will
not
hinder
our
rising
again
at
the
last
day
kevork
and
his
brothers
continued
jack
greatest
friends
kevork
talked
much
with
him
and
told
him
many
things
he
said
he
should
like
to
go
to
yeatessa
or
urfa
because
he
had
a
sister
there
a
married
sister
i
suppose
jack
said
rather
wondering
he
had
not
heard
of
her
before
said
kevork
lowering
his
voice
mysteriously
my
grandfather
had
to
send
her
away
to
our
cousins
because
the
kamaikan
who
was
here
before
this
one
wanted
to
marry
her
and
we
never
talk
of
her
not
even
before
gabriel
and
hagop
lest
any
word
might
slip
out
about
where
she
is
and
the
turks
might
overhear
but
i
had
rather
go
to
aintab
than
even
to
urfa
to
learn
english
and
greek
and
latin
and
grammar
and
geography
and
all
kinds
of
science
and
what
then
jack
asked
with
a
smile
then
i
would
go
if
i
could
to
america
or
to
england
learn
still
more
and
become
at
last
a
famous
professor
in
some
grand
college
in
a
christian
land
kevork
had
already
learned
from
a
friendly
priest
der
garabed
to
read
and
write
armenian
and
to
read
turkish
in
the
arabic
character
for
the
turks
and
it
is
a
significant
fact
have
never
reduced
their
own
language
to
writing
their
books
are
printed
either
in
the
arabic
or
in
the
armenian
character
he
was
in
raptures
when
jack
offered
to
teach
him
english
which
he
promptly
began
to
do
using
as
a
his
father
bible
the
only
book
he
had
with
the
exception
of
a
tauchnitz
westward
ho
which
happened
to
be
in
his
pocket
when
he
came
to
biridjik
in
return
kevork
taught
him
to
read
and
write
armenian
and
these
lessons
were
shared
by
gabriel
and
hagop
gabriel
was
a
remarkably
quick
intelligent
boy
all
life
and
fire
hagop
was
quiet
and
rather
dull
more
at
home
at
his
father
loom
than
at
his
brother
book
both
used
to
listen
delightedly
to
jack
when
chiefly
as
an
exercise
for
himself
he
would
translate
some
simple
bible
story
aloud
in
armenian
not
that
such
were
the
only
uses
jack
made
of
his
father
bible
outwardly
his
character
still
continued
unformed
boyish
passive
inwardly
it
had
begun
silently
to
grow
and
to
deepen
he
did
not
act
but
he
thought
a
great
deal
his
mind
was
like
a
stream
flowing
underground
gathering
volume
as
it
flowed
and
sure
to
emerge
again
to
the
light
of
the
upper
world
its
sources
were
fed
by
observation
memory
faith
and
hope
and
most
of
all
by
that
matchless
fount
not
only
of
spiritual
but
of
intellectual
inspiration
the
english
bible
chapter
v
baron
muggurditch
thomassian
warbling
still
amidst
the
others
wandering
with
them
where
they
roam
and
yet
hallowing
remembrance
with
low
gushes
about
home
no
doubt
some
subtle
form
of
nervous
weakness
the
relic
of
his
long
and
terrible
illness
still
held
young
john
grayson
in
its
grasp
moreover
the
loss
of
his
father
so
intensely
loved
had
entered
like
iron
into
his
soul
his
mother
death
was
still
when
he
left
home
a
recent
bereavement
and
he
was
an
only
child
he
had
no
near
relatives
except
in
his
uncle
family
and
even
amongst
them
there
was
only
one
he
cared
for
much
his
father
godson
a
cousin
five
years
his
senior
whose
fag
he
had
been
at
school
what
had
he
after
all
to
go
back
to
in
england
he
excused
his
torpor
with
thoughts
like
these
whenever
it
occurred
to
him
to
ask
himself
if
he
meant
to
spend
his
life
tending
vines
teaching
english
and
studying
armenian
in
a
little
town
on
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
he
spent
many
months
there
without
taking
much
note
of
time
the
meneshians
were
his
family
the
whole
armenian
community
his
friends
he
entered
more
and
more
into
their
life
shared
more
and
more
their
interests
he
was
especially
interested
in
the
culture
of
the
vineyard
wanting
to
know
the
how
and
the
why
of
everything
once
but
this
was
in
early
days
he
proposed
taking
kevork
and
a
couple
of
other
lads
with
him
and
going
to
stay
there
long
before
the
regular
vintage
time
we
could
guard
it
a
great
deal
better
he
said
than
that
lazy
turk
who
does
nothing
but
lie
all
day
on
his
perch
smoking
cigarettes
and
is
always
wanting
backsheesh
you
could
not
do
it
at
all
answered
boghos
the
eldest
son
of
hohannes
and
the
husband
of
mariam
hanum
just
because
you
are
not
a
turk
backsheesh
is
very
well
spent
in
setting
the
turk
to
watch
the
kourd
instead
of
both
of
them
preying
upon
us
do
you
not
know
that
yet
yon
effendi
they
all
continued
to
give
him
that
name
which
he
had
taught
in
the
first
instance
to
kevork
and
his
brothers
to
them
all
he
was
a
cross
between
a
pet
and
plaything
to
be
taken
care
of
and
a
superior
person
to
be
honoured
in
both
capacities
he
had
every
attention
and
all
his
wants
were
liberally
supplied
but
he
insisted
that
hohannes
should
expend
for
that
purpose
some
of
his
father
gold
and
should
give
from
time
to
time
a
small
sum
by
way
of
compensation
to
boghos
and
mariam
hanum
with
whom
he
lived
money
was
so
scarce
in
that
region
that
a
very
small
sum
sufficed
at
last
one
day
the
whole
meneshian
family
and
indeed
the
whole
armenian
quarter
of
biridjik
was
thrown
into
excitement
by
the
news
that
baron
muggurditch
thomassian
in
english
baptist
thomson
was
about
to
honour
them
with
a
visit
he
was
travelling
from
urfa
to
aintab
and
proposed
staying
a
day
or
two
on
his
way
with
his
kinsfolk
the
meneshians
jack
shared
in
the
excitement
he
was
very
curious
to
see
this
wealthy
travelled
educated
armenian
whom
he
expected
to
find
of
a
very
different
type
from
the
simple
folk
of
biridjik
and
now
at
last
he
was
sure
to
find
through
him
the
opportunity
of
communicating
with
his
friends
in
england
which
however
little
eagerness
he
might
feel
in
the
matter
he
knew
he
ought
not
to
neglect
what
could
the
duteous
and
admiring
kinsfolk
of
baron
thomassian
do
on
the
occasion
except
pay
him
the
attention
of
riding
three
hours
distance
to
meet
him
on
his
way
even
although
it
was
midwinter
the
rains
heavy
and
the
wretched
road
in
mud
boghos
led
the
party
and
jack
went
among
the
rest
old
hohannes
had
a
few
fine
horses
of
which
he
was
very
proud
and
he
had
given
one
of
them
to
jack
to
his
immense
delight
and
satisfaction
in
that
district
there
is
scarcely
any
snow
and
the
rain
had
happily
cleared
off
so
it
was
only
a
splashed
and
muddy
and
not
a
drenched
and
soaking
company
that
drew
up
by
the
wayside
in
the
shelter
of
a
little
hill
to
await
the
coming
of
the
travellers
at
last
the
jingling
of
mule
bells
announced
the
approach
of
the
caravan
there
was
a
long
string
of
khartijes
or
muleteers
there
were
some
servants
on
horseback
and
a
few
zaptiehs
to
act
as
guards
these
were
fully
armed
of
course
and
the
central
figure
of
the
whole
baron
thomassian
himself
rode
a
very
fine
horse
and
actually
carried
a
gun
at
his
side
for
which
he
must
have
got
a
special
permit
from
the
government
he
was
a
man
dressed
la
or
in
complete
european
costume
except
that
he
wore
a
fez
in
place
of
a
hat
which
was
amongst
the
things
forbidden
to
an
armenian
there
was
something
else
which
gave
all
the
biridjik
folk
a
great
surprise
beside
him
rode
a
slight
young
girl
closely
wrapped
in
a
long
ezhar
of
striped
silk
which
was
drawn
as
a
veil
over
the
greater
part
of
her
face
leaving
very
little
of
it
visible
except
her
large
beautiful
dark
eyes
veiled
though
she
was
boghos
recognised
his
daughter
and
kevork
at
least
guessed
his
sister
scarce
for
looking
at
her
could
they
give
their
kinsman
the
customary
greeting
paré
yejock
your
coming
is
a
joy
or
wait
for
the
response
paré
dessack
we
see
you
with
joy
and
thomassian
hastened
to
say
i
have
brought
your
daughter
back
to
you
at
the
request
of
your
cousin
baron
vartonian
i
will
explain
the
reason
afterwards
then
boghos
kissed
his
daughter
on
both
cheeks
and
she
kissed
his
hand
and
asked
for
his
blessing
kevork
kissed
her
also
and
jack
keeping
modestly
in
the
background
thought
what
a
pleasant
thing
it
must
be
to
have
a
sister
he
had
already
seen
lovely
faces
among
the
girls
and
women
of
biridjik
but
never
as
he
thought
eyes
quite
so
soft
and
dark
lips
quite
so
rosy
and
cheeks
of
such
perfect
form
and
hue
all
the
rest
who
were
old
acquaintances
came
crowding
round
her
and
then
boghos
turned
his
attention
to
jack
and
made
him
known
to
thomassian
with
much
polite
observance
as
their
english
friend
john
grayson
effendi
they
rode
back
together
to
biridjik
boghos
devoting
himself
to
the
entertainment
of
thomassian
jack
could
not
help
wondering
that
they
all
showed
so
little
pleasure
at
the
return
of
shushan
on
the
other
hand
a
sort
of
constraint
and
gloom
seemed
to
brood
over
the
whole
party
kevork
would
give
him
no
explanation
even
when
he
said
i
am
surprised
to
see
your
sister
looking
so
young
she
seems
scarcely
fourteen
i
thought
of
course
from
what
you
told
me
that
she
must
be
older
than
you
kevork
only
answered
with
a
quick
guarded
look
around
she
was
but
ten
years
old
when
she
left
us
after
the
festive
supper
in
honour
of
the
guest
thomassian
explained
the
matter
in
private
to
hohannes
and
to
boghos
your
former
kamaikan
mehmed
ibrahim
he
said
has
come
to
urfa
he
has
got
some
good
office
there
in
the
government
somehow
he
found
out
that
shushan
was
there
with
the
vartonians
and
he
has
not
forgotten
in
short
she
must
go
there
was
no
other
way
amaan
or
oh
dear
was
all
her
father
said
but
he
looked
perplexed
and
sorrowful
seeing
trouble
before
them
all
hohannes
put
the
trouble
into
words
he
may
find
out
and
send
after
her
here
the
vartonians
thought
not
you
must
keep
her
as
close
as
you
can
or
send
her
in
disguise
to
one
of
the
villages
how
dare
we
for
the
kourds
a
bride
on
her
way
from
the
church
was
carried
off
the
other
day
from
korti
and
the
bridegroom
and
her
father
who
tried
to
defend
her
were
both
killed
our
girls
are
not
safe
anywhere
except
in
their
graves
though
they
sat
within
closed
doors
they
all
spoke
in
low
tones
and
with
furtive
glances
around
them
our
only
possible
protection
thomassian
said
lies
in
the
wealth
our
abilities
and
our
industry
enable
us
to
gain
the
turks
and
kourds
consider
our
peace
and
safety
marketable
properties
which
they
are
willing
to
sell
us
at
a
good
price
yes
said
hohannes
sadly
until
they
find
we
have
nothing
more
to
give
or
until
it
suits
them
to
take
all
together
thomassian
who
probably
did
not
much
care
to
talk
on
these
matters
said
that
he
was
weary
with
his
journey
and
expressed
a
wish
to
go
early
to
rest
kevork
had
been
hanging
about
watching
for
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
him
and
now
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
he
came
forward
offering
politely
to
attend
him
to
his
a
little
later
he
came
quickly
and
evidently
in
much
excitement
into
the
room
where
shushan
was
sitting
with
her
mother
and
several
other
women
and
girls
of
the
household
who
had
come
in
to
see
her
mother
i
have
done
it
he
cried
done
what
my
son
asked
his
mother
she
was
sitting
as
usual
behind
her
wheel
but
its
whirr
was
silent
now
she
had
enough
to
do
in
looking
in
the
face
of
shushan
and
holding
her
hand
i
have
made
a
conquest
of
old
cousin
muggurditch
said
kevork
triumphantly
he
will
take
me
with
him
to
aintab
and
put
me
to
the
foreigners
school
a
murmur
of
surprise
ran
round
the
room
but
his
mother
asked
with
some
shrewdness
what
did
you
give
him
what
you
gave
me
mother
i
owe
all
to
you
it
was
those
gold
coins
that
did
it
the
other
women
looked
significantly
at
mariam
the
strings
of
gold
coins
which
she
wears
about
her
person
are
the
armenian
woman
only
absolute
and
indisputable
possession
they
stand
to
her
instead
of
settlements
and
dowry
that
must
be
precious
indeed
for
which
she
will
sacrifice
them
he
made
little
of
the
coins
at
first
said
the
lad
but
that
was
all
in
the
way
of
business
i
could
see
that
he
thought
a
good
deal
of
them
and
liked
well
to
get
them
how
much
did
you
sell
them
for
asked
mariam
i
did
not
sell
them
not
such
a
fool
as
that
i
mean
you
to
have
them
again
some
day
mother
i
only
gave
them
in
pledge
to
him
he
promising
to
advance
my
school
expenses
until
i
should
be
able
to
repay
him
but
that
is
for
ever
and
ever
said
one
of
the
women
nothing
of
the
sort
after
two
years
at
aintab
i
shall
be
a
teacher
and
able
to
earn
money
for
myself
here
shushan
looked
up
and
spoke
she
was
very
beautiful
not
only
with
the
beauty
characteristic
of
her
race
soft
dark
eyes
black
pencilled
eyebrows
almost
meeting
long
curling
eyelashes
and
regular
features
but
with
the
rarer
loveliness
of
a
sweet
pure
expression
that
suited
well
her
name
shushan
the
lily
during
her
four
years
of
absence
the
familiar
surroundings
of
home
had
become
strange
to
her
so
she
spoke
with
a
certain
timidity
my
brother
she
said
looking
appealingly
up
to
the
tall
youth
whom
she
had
left
a
mere
child
my
brother
will
you
do
something
for
me
when
you
go
to
aintab
kevork
protested
his
willingness
although
somewhat
surprised
my
dearest
friend
said
shushan
the
person
i
love
best
in
the
world
next
after
my
father
and
mother
and
my
brothers
is
just
now
going
to
aintab
to
the
school
for
girls
they
hurried
me
away
so
quickly
that
i
could
not
see
her
to
say
and
i
shall
not
see
her
now
for
although
she
must
pass
by
this
on
her
way
she
will
not
come
into
the
town
but
lodge
in
the
khan
outside
will
you
salute
her
for
me
and
give
her
this
as
a
gift
from
her
poor
little
friend
shushan
meneshian
she
drew
from
her
bosom
something
resembling
a
necklace
made
of
amber
beads
and
held
it
out
to
kevork
he
stooped
down
to
take
it
saying
well
then
my
sister
what
is
the
name
of
the
girl
elmas
stepanian
she
is
the
daughter
of
the
badvellie
badvellie
means
full
of
honour
and
the
armenians
usually
speak
of
their
priests
and
pastors
by
this
respectful
title
stay
kevork
said
his
mother
you
had
better
not
take
that
shushan
is
a
child
and
does
not
know
the
world
but
do
you
think
that
it
is
possible
the
foreigners
would
allow
the
boys
and
the
girls
to
speak
to
one
another
they
are
very
good
people
else
surely
our
cousins
would
not
have
let
their
own
children
and
shushan
go
to
school
to
them
this
certainly
was
a
difficulty
and
even
shushan
looked
perplexed
but
kevork
was
equal
to
the
occasion
yon
effendi
tells
me
that
the
foreign
effendis
men
and
women
talk
to
each
other
just
as
much
and
as
often
as
they
like
he
said
shushan
my
sister
i
will
pray
of
the
effendi
who
teaches
me
to
give
thy
token
to
the
effendi
who
teaches
oriort
elmas
stepanian
and
she
will
find
some
right
way
i
have
no
doubt
of
giving
it
to
her
do
so
kevork
and
i
thank
thee
many
times
she
gave
him
the
string
of
beads
and
then
her
tongue
waxed
eloquent
in
praise
of
her
friend
she
is
so
good
so
clever
she
said
she
knows
oh
so
many
things
she
can
speak
and
write
english
not
just
a
little
as
i
do
but
beautifully
like
a
real
american
she
knows
grammar
and
geography
and
the
counting
up
of
figures
and
the
story
of
the
world
she
does
not
want
a
like
that
to
help
her
both
turks
and
armenians
are
accustomed
when
thinking
or
talking
to
finger
strings
of
beads
called
and
to
obtain
some
mysterious
assistance
from
the
process
oh
no
she
would
never
use
one
at
school
nor
indeed
would
most
of
us
but
now
she
is
going
where
she
will
have
such
hard
lessons
to
learn
that
perhaps
she
may
be
glad
of
it
at
least
it
will
remind
her
of
her
poor
little
shushan
tell
her
kevork
that
shushan
puts
a
prayer
for
her
on
every
bead
she
sends
her
i
think
it
is
a
very
foolish
plan
to
teach
all
those
things
to
girls
one
of
the
old
women
observed
they
will
be
fit
for
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
reading
books
and
who
will
mind
the
babies
and
what
will
become
of
cooking
and
washing
and
baking
bread
not
to
talk
of
spinning
and
sewing
the
girls
of
the
american
school
at
urfa
cook
and
bake
and
spin
and
sew
right
well
for
their
years
shushan
spoke
up
bravely
and
those
who
go
to
aintab
like
elmas
learn
those
things
even
better
there
oh
i
wish
you
could
see
elmas
in
her
home
working
to
help
her
mother
and
taking
care
of
her
little
brothers
and
sister
you
would
know
what
she
was
worth
then
this
did
not
fall
upon
unheeding
ears
young
kevork
made
a
mental
note
of
it
then
turned
quickly
to
ask
his
mother
what
she
could
manage
to
give
him
in
the
way
of
clothing
as
his
cousin
wished
to
set
out
on
his
journey
the
morning
of
the
day
after
next
meanwhile
jack
was
busily
employed
writing
to
his
uncle
and
to
his
uncle
son
the
former
he
told
briefly
enough
of
his
father
death
his
own
long
illness
and
the
care
and
kindness
of
the
people
amongst
whom
he
had
fallen
he
asked
him
to
write
to
him
and
to
send
him
money
for
his
journey
home
and
also
to
recompense
those
who
had
been
so
good
to
him
he
knew
of
course
that
he
would
have
a
considerable
income
of
his
own
so
he
felt
no
difficulty
in
making
this
request
he
concluded
with
love
to
his
relatives
and
enquiries
after
their
welfare
to
his
cousin
he
wrote
more
freely
and
gave
more
particulars
but
even
to
him
his
words
did
not
flow
easily
he
could
not
take
up
his
life
in
his
hand
and
look
at
it
from
the
outside
so
as
to
describe
it
to
another
he
could
only
give
details
of
his
surroundings
and
of
this
he
soon
tired
being
unaccustomed
to
write
in
english
or
indeed
to
write
at
all
he
broke
off
abruptly
folded
up
the
two
letters
in
one
sealed
the
packet
directed
it
to
his
uncle
and
brought
it
to
thomassian
baron
muggurditch
thomassian
was
emphatically
the
courteous
cultured
cosmopolitan
armenian
he
had
amassed
a
considerable
fortune
in
his
business
which
was
that
of
a
merchant
of
drugs
and
to
which
he
joined
some
cautious
and
lucrative
moreover
he
had
travelled
far
and
seen
much
he
could
speak
several
languages
quite
well
enough
to
make
shrewd
bargains
in
them
and
he
knew
the
art
of
spending
as
well
as
of
making
money
he
could
appreciate
music
poetry
and
painting
no
less
than
luxuries
of
a
more
material
kind
yet
jack
felt
as
if
he
could
never
love
him
never
trust
him
even
as
he
did
his
friends
in
biridjik
i
do
know
what
it
is
he
said
to
himself
for
there
is
nothing
amiss
with
his
looks
except
perhaps
something
a
little
shifty
about
his
eyes
nothing
however
could
have
been
more
courteous
than
his
response
to
jack
request
that
he
would
take
charge
of
his
letter
and
see
it
safe
into
some
really
reliable
i
am
asking
my
friends
to
send
money
to
bring
me
home
he
added
by
way
of
explanation
how
did
you
tell
them
to
send
it
mr
grayson
asked
thomassian
i
never
thought
of
telling
them
how
i
thought
they
would
know
themselves
jack
answered
simply
it
is
not
so
simple
a
matter
as
you
think
said
thomassian
then
what
must
i
do
stay
could
it
be
managed
this
way
you
are
going
to
aleppo
yes
effendi
the
english
consul
there
was
my
father
friend
and
very
kind
to
us
he
would
let
my
uncle
send
the
money
to
him
and
would
know
how
to
send
it
to
me
i
daresay
he
would
write
to
my
uncle
too
you
will
ask
him
will
you
not
baron
thomassian
i
will
do
it
without
fail
and
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
jack
said
giving
him
his
hand
in
english
fashion
though
the
courteous
eastern
did
not
fail
to
bow
low
over
it
next
morning
muggurditch
thomassian
went
his
way
taking
with
him
letter
and
jack
chief
friend
kevork
but
leaving
behind
him
what
was
destined
to
be
of
still
more
importance
in
the
life
of
the
english
youth
footnotes
the
perch
upon
which
the
turkish
guard
reposed
was
a
kind
of
booth
erected
on
the
top
of
four
poles
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
high
planted
firmly
in
the
ground
miss
chapter
vi
roses
and
bath
towels
he
moved
about
the
house
with
joy
and
with
the
certain
step
of
man
john
i
give
you
my
salvation
very
softly
and
sweetly
fell
the
english
words
from
the
pretty
lips
of
shushan
jack
stood
before
her
it
was
spring
now
with
a
great
basket
of
spring
flowers
glorious
red
anemones
fragrant
wild
roses
pink
and
yellow
wild
heliotrope
wild
hyacinths
and
other
flowers
for
which
we
have
no
name
in
england
they
were
not
alone
together
of
course
mariam
hanum
was
there
at
her
wheel
and
two
or
three
other
women
or
girls
of
the
family
spinning
or
sewing
shushan
herself
was
bending
over
a
piece
of
the
beautiful
silk
embroidery
she
had
learned
in
urfa
when
the
entrance
of
the
young
englishman
with
the
flowers
they
all
loved
so
well
made
all
look
up
together
only
the
men
and
boys
of
their
own
family
might
come
in
thus
freely
to
the
room
where
the
women
sat
for
any
others
the
younger
ones
would
have
withdrawn
or
at
least
have
veiled
their
faces
modestly
shushan
at
her
first
used
to
do
so
for
jack
but
the
practice
had
gradually
and
insensibly
fallen
into
disuse
she
had
been
learning
english
in
the
school
in
urfa
and
at
this
time
it
was
the
greatest
pleasure
jack
had
in
life
to
hear
her
speak
it
she
was
not
unwilling
to
do
so
being
most
anxious
to
remember
all
she
had
been
taught
is
that
right
said
mr
yon
she
asked
it
is
very
nice
and
now
for
my
i
give
you
my
flowers
here
are
enough
for
everybody
he
laid
the
basket
down
beside
mariam
having
first
taken
out
a
fragrant
nosegay
of
roses
and
heliotrope
carefully
chosen
and
tied
with
grass
it
is
for
saying
a
good
lesson
he
explained
as
he
offered
it
to
shushan
jack
was
now
a
tall
handsome
youth
of
eighteen
of
late
he
had
grown
strong
and
active
and
he
took
part
as
much
as
he
could
in
outdoor
life
especially
in
riding
in
the
saddle
he
was
utterly
fearless
and
he
began
to
be
very
helpful
to
hohannes
in
the
training
of
his
young
horses
a
month
after
the
departure
of
thomassian
he
began
to
look
out
for
answers
to
his
letters
but
in
vain
he
watched
and
waited
nothing
came
for
him
weeks
passed
away
and
then
months
still
the
silence
was
unbroken
jack
was
astonished
disappointed
sometimes
by
fits
and
starts
he
was
angry
it
looked
as
if
his
english
friends
did
not
care
for
him
any
longer
as
if
they
chose
to
forget
him
if
it
were
not
so
why
had
they
all
this
time
made
no
effort
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
his
father
and
himself
very
well
if
so
it
were
he
could
do
without
them
he
could
not
just
then
feel
any
pressing
anxiety
to
leave
biridjik
although
of
course
he
always
meant
to
go
back
to
england
some
time
or
other
when
he
came
of
age
he
would
certainly
go
for
then
he
could
claim
his
inheritance
but
it
was
pleasant
here
how
richly
glowed
the
eastern
sky
how
glorious
the
wealth
of
roses
how
sweetly
smelled
the
blossoming
vines
as
he
rode
past
the
vineyards
on
the
hills
at
last
the
vintage
time
came
round
again
one
fine
autumn
morning
a
string
of
horses
mules
and
donkeys
stood
at
the
door
of
the
meneshians
house
upon
them
were
packed
two
tents
of
coarse
black
cloth
that
cloth
of
cilicia
which
the
of
tarsus
used
to
weave
some
thin
mattrasses
and
rugs
were
thrown
over
the
saddles
and
in
the
saddlebags
were
provisions
cooking
utensils
and
a
few
changes
of
dress
then
the
whole
family
from
old
hohannes
down
to
the
youngest
child
seated
themselves
or
were
seated
on
the
animals
as
best
they
could
find
a
place
and
the
yearly
visit
to
the
vineyards
the
great
autumn
holiday
of
the
armenians
began
if
ever
they
shook
off
the
deep
melancholy
which
ages
of
oppression
had
stamped
upon
their
race
it
was
in
the
simple
pleasures
of
those
sweet
vintage
days
the
days
were
all
too
short
for
them
so
they
began
them
very
early
with
the
singing
of
a
psalm
or
hymn
together
then
they
dispersed
to
the
different
kinds
of
work
allotted
to
them
some
stripped
the
low
trees
of
their
wealth
of
clusters
others
trod
out
the
juice
in
wooden
troughs
again
others
made
it
into
sherbet
or
into
a
kind
of
sugar
or
mixed
it
with
starch
and
with
the
kernels
of
nuts
for
the
preparation
of
bastuc
again
a
company
of
happy
children
plucked
the
large
grapes
singly
from
their
stalks
and
laid
them
in
the
sun
on
great
white
linen
cloths
to
turn
themselves
into
raisins
their
labours
were
lightened
with
talk
and
song
and
sometimes
even
with
jests
and
laughter
one
morning
john
grayson
gathering
grapes
apart
from
the
rest
heard
a
piteous
cry
for
help
the
voice
was
shushan
she
was
in
pain
or
danger
dropping
his
basket
on
the
ground
he
tore
along
leaping
over
the
low
vines
making
a
straight
line
for
the
spot
whence
came
the
cry
whence
came
also
horrible
sounds
the
yelps
the
snarls
the
growls
of
savage
dogs
in
a
corner
of
the
vineyard
shushan
and
little
hagop
clung
together
just
keeping
at
bay
with
loose
stones
from
the
low
wall
five
or
six
wild
wolfish
dogs
their
strength
was
nearly
gone
another
minute
and
they
would
be
torn
to
pieces
jack
dashed
in
amongst
the
dogs
dealing
frantic
kicks
and
blows
about
him
no
matter
what
came
next
if
only
he
saved
shushan
run
make
for
the
tent
he
cried
to
her
and
hagop
the
brutes
being
for
the
moment
occupied
with
him
the
thing
was
possible
and
they
did
it
the
sunshine
flashed
on
something
bright
in
the
belt
of
his
zeboun
the
great
scissors
used
for
cutting
grapes
he
seized
it
and
drove
it
with
all
his
might
into
the
neck
of
the
nearest
dog
yelping
with
pain
the
creature
ran
off
but
the
stoop
was
nearly
fatal
two
or
three
sprang
on
him
at
once
he
felt
fierce
teeth
meeting
in
his
flesh
done
for
he
groaned
conscious
only
of
agony
and
blackness
but
the
next
moment
a
tumult
of
cries
and
shouts
rang
in
his
ears
the
dogs
were
flying
in
all
directions
before
the
sticks
and
stones
of
his
friends
who
had
hurried
in
a
body
to
his
help
they
had
heard
the
yelping
even
before
shushan
and
hagop
trembling
and
exhausted
were
able
to
reach
them
the
creatures
belonged
to
some
kourdish
shepherds
who
chanced
to
be
passing
that
way
and
the
low
wall
of
the
vineyard
was
no
protection
against
their
attacks
jack
was
brought
back
to
his
tent
amidst
the
praises
and
condolences
of
the
whole
company
mariam
hanum
bound
up
his
wounds
weeping
and
blessing
him
and
saying
many
a
hearty
park
derocha
praise
to
the
lord
for
the
deliverance
of
her
children
shushan
did
not
say
much
but
after
they
went
home
from
the
vineyard
she
was
observed
to
be
very
busy
over
some
choice
embroidery
she
did
not
take
the
time
for
it
from
her
ordinary
work
or
from
any
of
her
domestic
tasks
but
she
worked
diligently
all
her
spare
time
and
sometimes
far
into
the
night
at
last
one
day
she
laid
a
parcel
of
considerable
size
at
the
feet
of
the
astonished
english
youth
saying
timidly
yon
effendi
you
saved
my
life
i
want
to
thank
you
the
parcel
contained
what
an
armenian
lady
considers
the
most
graceful
and
most
appropriate
gift
she
can
offer
to
a
gentleman
especially
if
it
be
all
her
own
work
a
set
of
beautifully
embroidered
bath
towels
but
a
day
was
to
come
when
john
grayson
would
have
given
all
he
possessed
nay
his
very
life
that
he
had
heard
shushan
meneshian
agonized
cry
for
help
in
the
vineyard
or
had
heard
it
too
late
chapter
vii
gathering
storms
if
thou
seest
the
oppression
of
the
poor
and
violent
perverting
of
judgment
and
justice
in
a
province
marvel
not
at
the
matter
for
he
that
is
higher
than
the
highest
regardeth
and
there
be
higher
than
they
after
this
adventure
jack
matured
much
more
quickly
his
manhood
grew
in
him
apace
and
with
it
came
courage
and
energy
and
the
spirit
of
enterprise
he
thought
often
of
england
now
wondering
at
the
silence
and
inaction
of
all
his
relatives
that
he
wrote
to
them
they
made
no
sign
he
would
not
have
wondered
at
if
he
had
known
all
the
truth
the
syrian
servants
of
his
father
who
had
abandoned
him
in
his
illness
and
stolen
his
baggage
brought
back
word
to
aleppo
that
both
father
and
son
were
dead
of
the
fever
for
obvious
reasons
they
did
not
remain
in
the
city
but
the
story
came
to
the
ears
of
the
consul
and
he
had
no
reason
to
doubt
its
truth
he
opened
some
letters
which
had
been
sent
to
him
for
grayson
and
having
thus
discovered
his
address
wrote
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
ignorant
of
all
this
jack
was
sometimes
tempted
to
unkind
thoughts
of
his
relatives
in
england
he
even
occasionally
allowed
himself
to
think
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
they
were
finding
the
grayson
money
very
convenient
and
that
it
might
go
hard
with
them
to
give
it
up
if
he
should
reappear
but
the
thought
like
snow
in
a
warm
climate
did
not
jack
was
essentially
a
generous
nature
it
was
an
added
wonder
however
even
greater
than
the
first
that
they
never
answered
the
letter
sent
them
through
thomassian
but
wondering
and
watching
was
idle
work
and
jack
now
a
man
grown
began
to
ask
himself
why
if
he
really
wanted
to
go
to
england
he
did
go
it
would
be
difficult
and
it
might
be
dangerous
but
all
the
better
for
that
what
hindered
his
borrowing
a
horse
asking
hohannes
to
give
him
whatever
remained
if
anything
did
remain
of
his
money
hiring
a
turkish
servant
and
making
a
dash
for
aleppo
once
there
the
consul
would
help
him
and
soon
after
his
return
to
england
he
would
be
of
age
and
able
to
act
for
himself
what
hindered
him
certainly
not
the
perils
of
the
way
though
these
were
very
real
he
had
passed
beyond
that
stage
now
finally
and
for
ever
the
thought
of
peril
far
from
daunting
him
now
made
his
blood
tingle
in
his
veins
then
what
hindered
him
he
was
an
englishman
and
he
had
his
life
to
live
his
inheritance
to
claim
his
birthright
to
recover
but
still
more
he
was
something
else
and
that
something
not
yet
expressed
not
yet
acknowledged
even
in
the
depths
of
his
own
heart
held
him
fast
in
the
little
town
by
far
euphrates
at
shushan
first
he
had
been
very
shy
of
her
but
in
brotherly
intercourse
that
had
worn
off
and
a
pleasant
camaraderie
had
grown
up
between
them
he
read
english
with
her
using
the
two
books
he
had
his
father
bible
and
westward
ho
and
she
had
an
armenian
bible
which
they
used
to
compare
with
the
english
well
she
loved
its
sweet
words
of
promise
and
often
she
would
point
them
out
to
jack
and
to
gabriel
who
generally
shared
the
lessons
but
their
talks
were
not
all
grave
they
had
many
a
quiet
laugh
together
over
her
broken
english
and
sometimes
jack
would
tell
her
stories
of
his
own
country
and
of
things
that
happened
there
she
in
return
would
talk
of
urfa
of
the
dear
american
school
of
her
beloved
elmas
stepanian
and
her
other
friends
she
would
describe
the
american
ladies
of
the
mission
tall
grave
miss
celandine
revered
as
a
mother
and
her
bright
young
colleague
miss
fairchild
lady
of
the
whom
however
he
entirely
failed
to
recognise
from
her
description
but
since
the
battle
with
the
dogs
and
the
gift
of
the
towels
his
shyness
had
returned
in
full
force
so
much
so
that
when
with
great
trouble
he
caught
in
hunting
and
brought
back
to
her
one
of
the
pretty
little
gazelles
the
armenians
love
to
keep
as
pets
it
cost
him
more
trouble
still
to
present
his
offering
but
he
was
rewarded
by
the
light
in
shushan
lovely
face
and
the
smile
with
which
she
spoke
her
gentle
much
very
thanks
master
john
yet
the
passion
that
began
to
grow
in
john
grayson
heart
was
love
and
burning
indignation
were
so
closely
twined
together
that
he
could
not
have
severed
them
if
he
tried
as
his
whole
development
since
his
illness
had
been
slow
so
it
was
but
slowly
and
gradually
that
he
grew
to
understand
the
conditions
under
which
shushan
and
all
the
rest
were
living
but
when
he
came
to
realize
them
fully
he
wished
at
first
to
escape
and
fight
his
way
to
the
coast
so
as
anyhow
and
on
any
terms
to
get
out
of
that
horrible
country
but
he
wished
afterwards
to
stay
and
stand
side
by
side
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
these
the
desolate
and
oppressed
whom
he
so
loved
never
perhaps
has
oppression
been
at
once
so
comprehensive
and
so
minute
the
iron
entered
into
their
souls
and
at
the
same
time
their
fingers
were
vexed
with
innumerable
pin
pricks
jack
had
seen
a
hundred
times
without
much
notice
the
rude
wooden
ploughs
in
use
in
the
district
mere
hurdles
with
pieces
of
iron
stuck
in
the
end
but
one
day
it
occurred
to
him
on
some
provocation
to
abuse
them
roundly
and
to
ask
if
there
was
not
a
smith
in
the
country
who
could
make
a
decent
ploughshare
our
smiths
could
make
anything
yours
could
said
avedis
with
whom
he
was
walking
then
why
do
they
i
thought
you
knew
he
lowered
his
voice
and
whispered
the
turk
you
mean
they
wo
allow
you
avedis
nodded
wait
till
we
get
home
he
said
the
conversation
was
resumed
where
alone
such
conversations
were
safe
though
not
always
even
there
within
closed
doors
i
know
said
jack
that
the
turks
hate
machinery
they
detest
it
and
they
fear
it
they
think
every
machine
the
work
of
shaytan
the
devil
i
ca
help
thinking
said
jack
of
the
dark
ages
and
of
what
i
read
of
them
before
i
came
here
are
men
of
the
twelfth
century
with
their
feet
on
the
necks
of
men
of
the
nineteenth
it
bad
for
both
must
be
puzzled
with
you
and
afraid
of
you
as
a
norman
baron
would
have
been
of
his
saxon
serfs
if
they
had
understood
all
about
steam
and
electricity
while
he
thought
those
things
mysterious
works
of
the
devil
but
i
wonder
how
long
he
could
have
kept
them
serfs
as
long
as
he
had
arms
and
they
had
none
more
especially
if
he
was
backed
up
from
outside
avedis
answered
sadly
then
he
sang
softly
as
if
to
himself
two
lines
of
an
old
armenian
national
song
if
i
can
not
have
a
christian
home
i
will
have
a
christian
grave
yon
effendi
he
resumed
their
hate
of
us
is
growing
every
day
and
now
i
think
they
mean
to
make
a
full
end
of
us
for
rumours
of
terrible
and
wholesale
massacres
were
reaching
them
every
day
now
it
was
about
sassoun
now
about
zeitun
now
about
marash
and
trebizond
that
these
things
were
whispered
from
lip
to
lip
such
rumours
kept
them
in
a
continual
state
of
apprehension
and
panic
for
they
knew
not
what
to
believe
and
had
no
means
of
learning
the
truth
it
was
easier
to
know
in
england
what
happened
in
any
town
of
armenia
than
to
know
it
in
another
town
of
the
same
country
the
turks
of
biridjik
triumphed
openly
and
some
of
them
boasted
to
their
giaour
neighbours
that
they
would
soon
have
all
that
belonged
to
them
some
of
the
christians
thought
they
were
all
sure
to
be
murdered
others
remembered
there
had
been
just
such
a
scare
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
before
but
that
then
it
had
come
to
nothing
so
they
thought
that
now
also
things
would
just
go
on
as
usual
neither
better
nor
worse
others
again
thought
anything
between
the
two
extremes
that
their
fears
or
their
fancies
prompted
john
grayson
thought
for
one
that
certainly
for
the
present
he
would
stay
where
he
was
it
is
not
in
the
hour
of
danger
one
rides
away
and
leaves
one
friends
behind
he
said
to
himself
more
than
four
years
had
passed
now
since
his
first
coming
to
the
country
he
was
twenty
years
of
age
full
six
feet
with
his
slippers
off
with
light
brown
hair
and
beard
fair
complexion
well
tanned
by
the
sun
english
blue
eyes
and
frank
fearless

face
chapter

a
proposal
he
either
fears
his
fate
too
much
or
his
desert
is
small
who
spares
to
put
it
to
the
touch
and
gain
or
lose
it
all
of
jack
often
went
to
the
service
held
daily
a
little
after
sunrise
in
the
gregorian
church
so
did
many
members
of
the
household
mariam
shushan
and
gabriel
especially
being
constant
attendants
one
day
the
returning
party
was
met
at
the
door
by
hagop
weeping
bitterly
asked
by
every
one
what
was
wrong
he
sobbed
out
the
cattle
the
cattle
what
is
wrong
with
the
cattle
they
are
not
wrong
they
are
all
gone
the
kourds
have
taken
them
away
every
one
every
one
the
kine
and
the
sheep
and
goats
as
well
there
not
a
cow
left
to
low
nor
a
lamb
to
bleat
of
them
all
the
shepherds
have
come
in
wounded
and
beaten
to
tell
us
grandfather
says
they
did
all
they
could
amaan
amaan
by
this
time
the
women
were
all
weeping
for
them
it
meant
ruin
almost
starvation
but
gabriel
touched
his
mother
hand
caressingly
and
whispered
a
word
from
the
psalm
they
had
just
sung
in
church
his
are
the
cattle
upon
a
thousand
hills
but
that
is
unbearable
jack
burst
out
it
to
be
borne
mariam
said
sadly
we
shall
see
i
can
not
believe
such
things
are
done
here
even
and
there
is
no
remedy
a
man
whole
possessions
swept
away
at
a
stroke
hagop
where
are
the
men
in
the
great
front
room
i
will
go
to
them
come
gabriel
but
hagop
pulled
his
brother
back
wo
be
let
in
he
said
i
was
not
i
am
two
years
older
but
you
are
not
a
man
father
said
is
for
men
and
took
me
by
the
shoulder
and
turned
me
out
jack
rather
wondered
what
had
to
be
talked
of
which
intelligent
boys
of
twelve
and
fourteen
ought
not
to
hear
but
he
said
nothing
and
went
in
at
once
he
found
all
the
men
of
the
household
with
a
few
of
their
intimate
friends
gathered
in
the
large
room
of
which
hagop
had
spoken
as
he
entered
all
were
silent
they
stood
together
in
a
dull
stupor
like
cattle
before
a
thunderstorm
in
their
faces
was
profound
sadness
mingled
with
fear
jack
looked
around
on
them
and
cried
out
impetuously
are
we
going
to
stand
this
outrageous
robbery
is
there
nothing
to
be
done
there
was
no
answer
some
bowed
their
heads
despairingly
others
put
their
hands
on
their
hearts
and
said
amaan
others
again
looked
up
and
murmured
god
help
us

turned
to
hohannes
the
old
man
was
weeping
his
face
buried
in
his
cloak
the
sight
touched
him
father
do
not
weep
he
said
gently
we
will
try
to
recover
at
least
something
hohannes
flung
his
cloak
aside
with
a
gesture
of
passionate
pain
dost
think
i
am
weeping
for
sheep
and
oxen
he
said
friends
this
young
man
is
to
me
as
a
son
and
to
shushan
as
a
brother
tell
him
i
can
not
pale
with
a
new
alarm
jack
turned
to
the
rest
what
is
he
cried
tell
me
in
god
name
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
at
last
avedis
who
seemed
fated
to
belie
his
name
found
his
voice
he
said
hoarsely
just
after
the
shepherds
came
to
tell
about
the
flocks
my
father
was
called
aside
it
was
a
private
message
from
the
kamaikan
who
is
not
so
bad
as
some
he
sent
to
warn
us
that
mehmed
ibrahim
has
found
out
shushan
is
here
he
will
send
to
demand
her
for
his
harem
and
we
will
have
to
give
her
up
jack
groaned
and
turned
his
face
away
silence
fell
upon
them
all
a
silence
that
might
be
felt
after
a
while
some
one
said
he
has
not
sent
yet
the
kamaikan
warning
was
well
meant
yes
said
avedis
we
have
given
gold
he
will
get
us
a
respite
if
he
can
what
use
in
a
respite
boghos
shushan
father
moaned
in
his
despair
except
to
dress
the
bride
the
a
younger
man
repeated
rage
hate
and
shame
concentrated
in
the
word
there
was
another
pause
and
a
long
one
then
john
grayson
strode
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stood
there
his
form
erect
his
eyes
flashing
his
arm
outstretched
listen
he
cried
in
a
voice
like
the
sharp
report
of
a
rifle
every
one
turned
towards
him
but
old
hohannes
said
hopelessly
it
is
no
use
yet
speak
on
yon
effendi
thou
dost
ever
speak
wisely
there
is
one
way
of
saving
shushan
let
me
speak
first
an
old
man
as
old
as
hohannes
broke
in
hastily
englishman
thou
hast
lived
long
among
us
but
thou
art
not
of
our
race
thou
dost
not
yet
understand
that
we
are
born
to
suffer
and
have
no
defence
except
patience
i
wot
thou
wouldst
talk
to
us
of
fighting
and
resistance
for
thou
art
young
and
thy
blood
is
hot
but
i
am
old
and
my
head
is
grey
i
have
seen
that
tried
often
enough
ay
god
knows
too
often
did
not
my
son
die
in
a
turkish
prison
and
my
daughter
whom
he
struck
those
blows
to
save
well
she
is
dead
now
and
shushan
as
we
hope
will
die
soon
for
god
is
merciful
but
let
there
be
no
word
spoken
of
resistance
here
for
that
means
only
anguish
piled
on
anguish
wrong
heaped
on
wrong
without
change
of
voice
or
attitude
jack
repeated
his
words
there
is
one
way
of
saving
shushan
avedis
spoke
up
boldly
let
us
hear
what
yon
effendi
has
to
say
he
saved
her
once
already
from
the
wild
dogs
jack
looked
round
the
room
do
i
not
see
a
priest
here
yes
der
garabed
the
priest
had
been
ill
and
had
come
out
now
for
the
first
time
drawn
by
sympathy
for
the
troubles
of
the
meneshians
he
was
sitting
in
a
corner
on
some
cushions
but
when
his
name
was
spoken
he
rose
in
his
long
black
robe
with
large
sleeves
like
an
english
clergyman
gown
what
do
you
want
of
me
yon
effendi
he
asked
i
want
you
to
marry
me
morning
to
shushan
meneshian
a
murmur
of
astonishment
ran
round
the
room
old
hohannes
was
the
first
to
speak
dear
son
thou
art
beside
thyself
forget
thy
foolish
words
we
will
forget
them
also
i
am
not
beside
myself
and
i
speak
words
of
truth
and
soberness
said
jack
to
whom
bible
diction
came
naturally
now
there
is
no
other
way
one
can
not
do
things
after
that
fashion
the
priest
said
vaguely
being
much
perplexed
nor
in
such
haste
one
must
be
careful
not
to
profane
a
sacrament
of
the
church
where
is
the
profanation
i
love
her
more
than
my
life
crimson
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
with
the
blood
throbbing
in
every
vein
john
grayson
stood
in
that
supreme
moment
revealed
to
his
own
heart
and
flinging
out
the
revelation
as
a
challenge
to
all
that
company
of
sorrowful
despairing
men
it
is
a
strange
thing
a
very
strange
thing
said
hohannes
stroking
his
beard
he
expressed
the
sense
of
the
whole
assembly
the
proposal
was
a
breach
of
every
convention
of
their
race
amongst
whom
betrothal
invariably
precedes
marriage
it
can
not
be
done
in
that
way
was
their
feeling
jack
knew
their
customs
as
well
as
they
did
but
being
an
englishman
he
thought
necessity
should
and
must
override
custom
he
spoke
again
with
that
curious
calmness
which
sometimes
marks
the
very
heart
of
an
intense
emotion
the
spot
of
still
water
in
the
midst
of
the
whirlpool
as
the
wedded
wife
of
an
englishman
no
turk
will
dare
to
molest
her
i
should
like
to
see
him
try
it
he
would
have
england
to
reckon
with
and
england
can
keep
her
own
now
if
any
hope
survived
in
the
crushed
hearts
of
these
oppressed
downtrodden
armenians
it
was
hope
in
england
the
english
were
christians
so
they
would
have
the
will
to
help
them
they
were
mighty
warriors
and
conquerors
so
they
would
have
the
power
themselves
under
the
pressure
of
a
malignant
irresistible
power
they
had
perhaps
an
exaggerated
idea
of
what
power
could
accomplish
if
combined
with
beneficence
certainly
for
a
young
man
to
marry
a
girl
in
that
way
without
preparation
without
betrothal
without
even
time
to
make
the
wedding
clothes
was
a
thing
unheard
of
since
the
days
of
gregory
yet
what
if
it
were
the
only
way
of
saving
shushan
hohannes
spoke
at
last
yon
effendi
he
asked
have
you
the
to
do
this
is
there
in
your
own
land
no
head
of
your
house
no
kinsman
without
whose
leave
this
thing
ought
not
to
be
done
answer
as
in
the
sight
of
god
jack
held
up
his
head
proudly
there
is
none
he
said
i
am
my
own
master
then
hohannes
resumed
it
is
my
mind
to
say
to
you
do
what
is
in
your
heart
and
may
god
bless
you
then
said
jack
with
your
leave
father
i
will
ask
her
and
i
the
head
of
her
house
give
her
to
you
in
the
name
of
god
jack
looked
around
in
perplexity
but
you
know
i
have
got
to
ask
her
he
repeated
boy
as
he
was
when
he
left
england
he
knew
that
when
a
man
wished
to
marry
the
one
indispensable
preliminary
was
to
ask
the
lady
of
his
choice
then
arose
boghos
who
had
been
nearly
silent
hitherto
in
a
sorrow
too
great
for
words
or
tears
i
too
her
father
i
give
her
unto
thee
in
the
name
of
god
he
said
solemnly
i
have
only
then
to
ask
her
jack
persisted
thou
asked
and
we
have
given
her
it
was
hohannes
who
spoke
now
what
yet
remains
to
do
jack
pulled
himself
together
and
tried
to
explain
but
if
she
does
not
like
me
i
ca
you
do
you
understand
i
must
speak
to
her
and
ask
her
if
she
will
have
me
the
men
stood
silent
looking
at
each
other
had
they
spoken
their
thoughts
they
would
have
said
heard
ever
any
man
the
like
of
that
scarcely
would
they
have
been
more
surprised
had
jack
wishing
to
sell
his
horse
announced
that
he
could
not
conclude
the
bargain
without
the
creature
express
consent
at
last
avedis
threw
out
a
modest
suggestion
this
may
be
one
of
the
customs
of
the
english
people
which
we
do
not
understand
no
doubt
they
have
their
customs
as
we
have
ours
jack
turned
to
him
gratefully
you
are
right
avedis
it
the
custom
of
my
country
to
take
the
or
only
from
the
lips
a
very
strange
custom
muttered
boghos
but
if
it
the
custom
we
ought
to
conform
to
it
however
strange
or
unsuitable
it
may
appear
to
us
der
garabed
advised
we
should
do
all
things
in
order
and
moreover
should
we
fail
in
this
it
might
happen
that
in
the
english
country
the
marriage
would
not
be
recognised
therefore
this
is
what
i
propose
let
us
send
for
the
young
maiden
and
let
the
englishman
in
our
presence
do
after
the
manner
of
his
country
this
was
too
appalling
jack
tingled
all
over
at
the
thought
of
such
an
ordeal
for
shushan
and
for
himself
oh
i
ca
for
heaven
sake
let
me
go
to
her
he
said
if
that
also
is
according
to
the
custom
it
shall
be
duly
observed
said
hohannes
with
the
air
of
one
who
humours
a
sick
person
let
us
all
go
happily
for
jack
some
of
those
present
had
the
sense
to
reflect
that
the
women
apartment
would
not
hold
them
all
and
that
therefore
their
assistance
might
be
dispensed
with
still
the
grandfather
and
father
of
the
maiden
two
of
her
uncles
the
priest
and
three
other
persons
thought
it
behoved
them
to
go
and
witness
the
due
performance
of
this
ceremony
of
the
english
jack
was
conducted
by
this
solemn
group
to
the
room
where
shushan
sat
with
her
mother
as
with
trembling
footsteps
he
approached
her
the
rest
fell
back
and
stood
in
a
grave
their
ears
and
eyes
intent
upon
his
every
word
and
motion
heaven
help
me
thought
jack
had
ever
man
to
propose
in
such
a
way
what
shall
i
say
but
no
words
would
come
to
him
sense
and
speech
seemed
both
to
have
departed
from
him
the
silence
throbbed
in
his
ears
like
a
pulse
of
pain
the
awful
silence
which
he
knew
he
ought
to
break
which
he
break
for
his
life
and
more
than
his
life
and
yet
he
could
not
not
a
word
could
he
utter
shushan
meanwhile
not
knowing
what
all
this
might
portend
hastily
veiled
her
face
and
clung
to
her
mother
mariam
had
a
copper
dish
which
she
had
been
cleaning
in
her
hand
and
in
her
surprise
and
alarm
she
let
it
go
it
slipped
slowly
down
her
dress
and
fell
at
last
with
a
slight
sound
upon
the
floor
in
the
strained
silence
every
one
started
and
shushan
dropped
her
veil
with
a
little
frightened
cry
jack
saw
her
sweet
face
pale
with
anguish
her
soft
dark
eyes
heavy
with
unshed
tears
every
thought
was
lost
in
an
unutterable
longing
to
snatch
her
from
the
fate
that
threatened
her
will
you
let
me
save
you
shushan
he
pleaded
coming
close
to
her
and
his
voice
was
the
voice
of
a
strong
man
infinite
tenderness
shushan
stood
up
looked
around
upon
her
father
her
grandfather
and
all
the
rest
then
looked
calmly
and
steadily
in
the
face
of
the
englishman
she
said
softly
for
she
knew
there
was
one
way
of
escape
for
the
christian
maiden
in
a
strait
like
hers
there
had
been
often
in
armenia
christian
fathers
strong
enough
to
say
like
virginius
and
now
my
own
dear
little
girl
there
is
no
way
but
this
what
more
likely
than
that
the
brave
kind
englishman
whom
it
would
not
hurt
so
much
as
he
was
not
of
her
own
blood
might
do
for
her
that
which
her
kindred
would
find
too
hard
there
was
a
strange
fascination
a
sort
of
rapture
in
the
thought
of
dying
by
his
hand
i
am
not
afraid
she
said
with
a
firm
sweet
look
not
afraid
to
die
die
jack
cried
in
horror
who
talks
of
dying
no
you
shall
not
die
but
live
you
shall
live
for
me
my
own
true
wife
in
happy
england
say
to
that
shushan
she
looked
at
him
in
wonder
at
last
the
colour
mounted
to
her
pale
cheeks
her
lips
parted
softly
and
a
low
murmur
came
if
god
wills
hohannes
turned
gravely
to
the
rest
no
doubt
he
said
stroking
his
beard
yon
effendi
has
done
after
the
manner
of
the
english
when
they
would
take
their
wives
if
he
is
satisfied
we
may
go
our
way
thanking
god
who
has
sent
him
to
the
help
of
our
dear
child
in
her
peril
jack
heart
beat
thickly
as
one
by
one
they
went
and
he
was
left
alone
with
shushan
and
her
mother
hohannes
had
looked
back
to
see
if
he
were
following
but
no
he
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
the
custom
of
his
country
thought
the
old
man
and
passed
on
jack
stood
looking
on
the
ground
not
daring
to
raise
his
eyes
to
shushan
face
but
when
the
last
retreating
footstep
had
died
away
he
looked
up
and
there
was
that
in
his
face
which
she
had
never
seen
before
the
question
of
his
heart
was
this
does
she
care
for
or
am
i
only
better
than
a
turk
it
spoke
in
his
eyes
and
thrilled
her
with
a
sense
of
something
strangely
new
and
sweet
he
had
been
kind
and
good
to
her
for
so
long
a
time
but
what
was
this
instinctively
she
turned
from
him
to
her
mother
mariam
tears
of
joy
and
thankfulness
were
falling
drop
by
drop
she
could
have
thrown
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
deliverer
of
her
child
but
true
to
the
custom
of
her
race
when
a
maiden
is
in
the
presence
of
him
who
has
chosen
her
she
drew
the
veil
over
her
daughter
face
ah
jack
exclaimed
involuntarily
but
he
had
seen
enough
enough
at
least
to
assure
him
that
he
could
teach
shushan
to
love
him
as
he
loved
her
dear
mother
he
said
you
have
been
a
mother
to
me
for
so
long
now
i
am
going
to
be
your
son
altogether
and
take
care
of
your
lily
scarcely
had
the
men
reached
the
court
when
the
priest
said
gravely
there
is
one
thing
we
have
left
out
of
our
account
which
is
serious
and
may
not
be
disregarded
an
englishman
can
not
marry
a
subject
of
the
sultan
without
a
written
permission
from
his
own
consul
even
if
he
can
do
it
except
in
the
consul
presence
under
the
circumstances
i
dare
not
perform
the
ceremony
terrible
harm
might
come
of
it
and
moreover
it
might
not
be
valid
in
england
most
of
the
party
knew
this
already
but
in
their
excitement
they
had
disregarded
or
forgotten
it
they
stood
just
as
they
were
in
the
court
and
looked
at
one
another
all
faces
gathered
blackness
call
forth
yon
effendi
and
tell
him
said
hohannes
avedis
called
him
and
he
came
his
face
flushed
and
glowing
with
a
shy
rapture
der
garabed
explained
the
difficulty
jack
tossed
his
head
impatiently
like
a
young
horse
restrained
unwillingly
by
bit
and
bridle
what
a
plague
he
cried
in
boyish
indignation
then
his
face
changed
and
sobered
as
the
man
within
him
asserted
himself
he
seemed
to
grow
years
older
all
at
once
this
is
what
we
will
do
he
said
bring
shushan
well
disguised
to
one
of
the
christian
villages
near
you
know
them
all
and
which
is
best
to
choose
and
hide
her
there
for
a
few
days
i
will
take
horse
this
very
hour
and
ride
to
urfa
you
know
it
is
reported
the
consul
is
there
at
present
if
he
is
i
can
see
him
if
not
i
can
go
after
him
i
daresay
he
can
give
me
some
writing
or
document
which
will
make
everything
straight
for
us
but
if
he
can
not
and
the
thing
must
be
done
in
his
presence
i
will
bring
shushan
to
him
were
he
at
the
end
of
the
world
for
i
carry
this
thing
through
or
i
die
for
it
so
help
me
god
good
and
before
you
go
we
will
betroth
her
to
you
hohannes
answered
then
he
took
him
privately
into
the
room
where
his
father
things
were
hidden
he
gave
him
all
the
gold
that
remained
and
then
with
an
air
of
mystery
took
out
another
parcel
and
having
unwound
its
many
wrappings
displayed
to
jack
astonished
eyes
a
small
revolver
and
a
belt
of
cartridges
i
did
not
know
you
had
these
he
said
no
i
was
afraid
to
tell
you
while
you
were
but
a
boy
lest
some
chance
word
to
your
companions
might
betray
that
we
had
firearms
here
and
ruin
us
all
or
else
you
might
have
been
too
eager
to
get
hold
of
them
and
unwilling
to
wait
but
now
you
are
a
man
and
have
sense
and
understanding
and
on
the
way
to
urfa
where
there
are
robbers
they
may
be
of
use
to
you
jack
took
the
revolver
in
great
delight
and
went
off
to
examine
it
in
england
he
had
been
a
good
shot
for
a
boy
of
his
age
though
only
with
an
ordinary
gun
but
he
had
sometimes
cleaned
the
revolver
for
his
father
so
he
knew
what
to
do
he
found
it
in
a
terrible
condition
from
rust
and
damp
and
feared
it
would
be
quite
useless
however
he
managed
with
great
difficulty
to
clean
two
barrels
out
of
the
six
and
to
load
them
more
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
as
he
was
thus
engaged
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
knowing
his
occupation
to
be
a
very
dangerous
one
he
did
not
say
come
in
but
went
and
opened
it
cautiously
gabriel
stood
there
yon
effendi
he
said
the
post
is
going
well
that
means
that
you
may
get
to
urfa
in
nine
hours
instead
of
in
two
days
for
you
know
they
go
the
whole
way
at
a
hard
gallop
it
means
safety
too
for
they
have
zaptiehs
to
guard
them
good
gabriel
is
shouldst
be
called
avedis
good
tidings
i
will
go
at
once
and
settle
to
go
along
with
them
you
will
hide
said
gabriel
with
a
frightened
glance
at
the
revolver
mean
death
and
oh
yon
effendi
one
word
please
he
stooped
kissed
his
hand
and
pressed
his
forehead
to
it
tell
them
a
boy
comes
with
you
take
me
i
pray
of
you
yon
effendi
jack
hesitated
there
would
be
danger
for
you
he
said
no
more
than
here
but
your
father
and
mother
and
your
grandfather
gabriel
they
give
me
leave
nay
they
wish
it
they
say
it
is
for
my
sister
you
are
doing
all
this
therefore
if
i
can
help
you
and
i
can
i
know
turkish
well
and
that
will
be
very
useful
i
know
the
ways
of
the
turks
too
much
better
than
you
do
and
i
love
you
yon
effendi
there
was
reason
in
what
he
said
and
in
the
end
he
had
his
way
that
evening
all
the
meneshian
family
met
together
in
the
largest
room
of
their
house
the
men
and
boys
sitting
at
one
side
of
it
the
women
at
the
other
at
an
ordinary
time
they
would
have
called
their
neighbours
and
chief
friends
but
now
they
were
afraid
to
do
it
so
der
garabed
was
the
only
outsider
and
his
presence
was
official
for
he
read
certain
prayers
of
the
church
and
a
passage
of
scripture
then
jack
stood
up
and
walked
over
to
the
place
where
shushan
sat
beside
her
mother
in
his
hand
was
his
father
bible
and
another
book
an
armenian
hymnbook
shushan
rose
and
stood
before
him
with
bowed
head
and
veiled
face
as
with
a
few
words
he
gave
her
the
books
she
took
them
from
him
and
laid
them
on
the
table
no
word
was
spoken
by
her
in
taking
them
she
had
done
enough
the
betrothal
was
sealed
then
according
to
custom
the
boys
handed
round
bastuc
and
paclava
a
kind
of
paste
made
with
honey
and
also
coffee
and
sherbet
but
this
was
rather
a
sacrifice
to
use
and
wont
than
a
genuine
festivity
the
little
gathering
soon
broke
up
and
jack
and
gabriel
prepared
for
their
journey
at
nightfall
they
said
to
their
friends
and
kindred
the
usual
paree
menác
remain
with
blessing
and
were
answered
by
the
usual
and
in
this
case
most
heartfelt
paree
yetac
go
with
blessing
chapter
ix
peace
and
strife
they
that
have
seen
thy
look
in
death
no
more
may
fear
to
die
john
grayson
and
gabriel
meneshian
were
threading
their
way
through
the
narrow
unsavoury
streets
of
urfa
the
gutters
which
ran
down
the
middle
often
not
leaving
them
room
to
walk
side
by
side
they
had
left
their
horses
at
a
khan
and
were
now
seeking
the
dwelling
of
the
vartonians
to
which
they
had
been
directed
emerging
at
last
into
a
wider
thoroughfare
they
saw
a
church
standing
in
the
midst
of
its
churchyard
of
which
the
gate
was
open
we
must
be
in
our
own
quarter
cried
gabriel
delighted
for
this
is
a
christian
church
jack
stepped
inside
the
gate
and
looked
at
it
with
interest
the
door
of
the
church
was
open
also
and
gabriel
seeing
him
look
towards
it
said
you
might
go
in
there
yon
effendi
and
rest
a
little
for
i
see
you
are
tired
to
death
i
will
run
on
and
try
and
find
the
house
it
can
not
be
far
off
now
but
you
are
tired
too
not
a
bit
i
would
feel
quite
fresh
this
minute
if
i
only
had
a
drink
and
by
good
luck
there
goes
a
fellow
outside
a
turk
too
with
a
bucket
full
of
to
sell
the
turk
who
had
been
crying
his
ware
stopped
at
the
moment
for
he
saw
an
armenian
boy
coming
down
the
street
with
a
large
empty
pitcher
in
his
hand
you
want
this
said
he
preparing
to
pour
his
sour
milk
into
it
the
boy
said
he
wanted
nothing
of
the
kind
he
had
been
sent
for
water
and
water
he
must
bring
his
people
were
waiting
for
it
and
would
be
very
angry
he
tried
to
pass
on
but
the
turk
laid
hold
on
him
seized
his
pitcher
and
emptied
the
bucket
of
into
it
not
without
spilling
a
good
deal
in
the
street
now
pay
me
my
money
he
said
but
the
thing
is
no
use
to
me
the
boy
protested
ruefully
what
does
that
matter
dog
of
a
giaour
you
got
it
and
by
the
beard
of
the
prophet
you
must
pay
for
it
as
the
boy
crying
bitterly
searched
for
the
few
piastres
he
had
about
him
jack
honest
english
face
flushed
with
wrath
and
gabriel
would
have
sprung
to
the
rescue
had
he
not
laid
his
hand
on
him
and
whispered
wait
they
waited
until
the
turk
had
turned
down
a
side
street
then
jack
hailed
the
lad
who
was
standing
quite
still
gazing
dolefully
at
his
useless
pitcher
of
will
you
give
us
a
drink
he
asked
coming
out
of
the
gate
we
are
dying
of
thirst
the
boy
checked
his
sobs
and
for
answer
held
up
his
pitcher
to
the
lips
of
the
stranger
jack
took
a
long
deep
draught
then
passed
it
on
to
gabriel
while
he
made
the
boy
happy
with
more
piastres
than
the
turk
had
taken
from
him
his
tears
all
gone
he
blessed
the
strangers
for
good
christians
and
thanked
them
in
the
name
of
the
lord
what
church
is
that
asked
gabriel
giving
back
the
pitcher
that
oh
that
is
the
church
of
the
protestants
is
it
english
then
jack
asked
feeling
a
pull
at
his
heart
strings
no
it
is
armenian
but
it
is
of
the
religion
of
the
foreigners
who
talk
english
they
are
good
people
and
very
kind
to
the
poor
perhaps
there
is
service
going
on
as
the
church
is
open
jack
said
i
will
go
and
see
do
said
gabriel
meanwhile
this
lad
will
help
me
to
find
the
vartonians
and
i
will
come
back
for
you
jack
passed
through
the
churchyard
and
leaving
his
shoes
on
the
threshold
entered
the
church
the
interior
was
very
handsome
all
of
white
stone
and
adorned
with
fine
pillars
and
beautiful
carving
it
was
not
unlike
a
gregorian
church
save
for
the
absence
of
pictures
in
the
window
over
what
the
gregorians
called
the
altar
and
the
protestants
the
table
of
the
lord
was
a
small
red
cross
there
was
a
very
low
partition
separating
the
places
where
the
men
and
the
women
sat
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
rushes
before
the
holy
table
on
a
kind
of
couch
all
draped
in
snowy
white
and
covered
with
flowers
something
lay
jack
knew
what
it
was
for
he
had
seen
the
dead
laid
in
the
church
at
biridjik
to
await
their
final
rest
with
bowed
head
and
reverent
footsteps
he
drew
near
to
look
venturing
gently
to
draw
aside
the
from
the
face
he
saw
it
was
that
of
a
woman
not
evidently
a
young
and
lovely
girl
like
shushan
but
one
who
had
lived
her
life
had
borne
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
and
it
well
might
be
was
glad
to
rest
perhaps
yesterday
there
were
wrinkles
on
the
cheek
and
furrows
on
the
brow
now
death
kind
beautiful
death
had
smoothed
them
all
away
and
stamped
instead
his
own
signet
there
of
which
the
legend
is
peace
the
closed
white
lips
had
that
look
we
have
seen
on
the
faces
of
our
dead
as
if
they
are
of
those
god
whispers
in
the
ear
and
they
though
they
can
not
tell
us
english
words
that
he
had
heard
long
ago
came
floating
through
the
brain
of
john
grayson
the
peace
of
god
that
passeth
all
understanding
he
found
himself
once
more
in
the
church
of
his
childhood
while
a
solemn
voice
breathed
over
the
hushed
congregation
those
words
of
blessing
then
coming
back
to
the
present
he
thought
it
takes
away
the
fear
of
death
to
see
a
dead
face
like
that
he
reverently
replaced
the
veil
and
withdrawing
somewhat
into
the
shadow
knelt
down
to
pray
as
he
knelt
there
he
heard
the
footsteps
of
one
who
came
to
look
upon
the
dead
rising
noiselessly
he
saw
a
tall
man
dressed
la
approach
the
bier
his
bent
head
was
streaked
with
grey
his
face
pale
with
intense
though
quiet
sorrow
as
he
knelt
down
silently
beside
his
dead
john
grayson
knew
instinctively
that
the
love
of
those
two
had
been
what
his
love
and
shushan
might
become
if
god
left
them
together
for
half
a
happy
lifetime
for
a
few
minutes
the
silence
lasted
then
came
that
most
sorrowful
of
all
earth
sounds
of
sorrow
the
sob
of
a
strong
man
jack
kept
quiet
in
the
shadow
of
his
pillar
in
reverence
and
awe
not
for
worlds
would
he
have
betrayed
his
presence
there
afraid
gabriel
might
come
in
search
of
him
he
looked
round
for
some
chance
of
escape
he
saw
to
his
relief
a
small
side
door
near
where
he
was
standing
he
crept
towards
it
noiselessly
found
it
unlocked
withdrew
the
little
bolt
and
going
through
the
pastor
study
slipped
out
into
the
churchyard
to
wait
for
gabriel
yes
there
he
was
just
coming
in
at
the
gate
he
went
to
meet
him
did
you
think
me
long
yon
effendi
asked
the
boy
i
have
found
the
vartonians
and
i
am
to
bring
you
to
them
at
once
baron
vartonian
himself
is
away
from
home
but
one
of
his
sons
would
have
come
with
me
to
bid
you
welcome
to
their
house
only
they
are
in
great
trouble
for
pastor
stepanian
their
badvellie
whom
they
love
has
just
lost
his
wife
shushan
will
be
very
sorry
for
oriort
elmas
stepanian
the
badvellie
daughter
is
her
greatest
friend
i
know
jack
answered
softly
i
have
seen
the
face
of
the
dead
gabriel
i
do
not
think
that
it
can
be
very
hard
to
die
no
said
gabriel
it
would
not
be
hard
to
die
for
christ
sake
yon
effendi
it
reminds
me
jack
went
on
as
if
talking
to
himself
of
the
last
words
i
heard
my
father
say
dark
river
turns
to
light
jack
was
received
with
open
arms
by
the
whole
vartonian
household
it
was
even
a
larger
household
than
that
of
the
meneshians
in
biridjik
its
head
a
prosperous
merchant
was
absent
in
aleppo
but
there
was
his
old
infirm
father
and
there
were
his
numerous
sons
and
daughters
two
or
three
of
them
married
with
children
of
their
own
but
the
youngest
still
a
child
there
were
also
many
servants
some
of
the
family
were
gregorians
and
some
protestants
but
there
was
no
friction
or
jealousy
between
the
two
being
people
of
substance
their
house
built
as
usual
around
a
court
was
large
and
very
handsomely
furnished
the
carved
elaborately
and
the
curtains
rugs
and
carpets
of
rich
materials
and
beautifully
embroidered
the
vartonians
considered
jack
in
the
light
of
a
hero
but
they
were
uneasy
at
shushan
being
left
even
for
the
present
in
a
village
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
the
kourds
for
much
more
was
known
at
urfa
than
at
biridjik
about
the
disturbed
state
of
the
country
and
the
terrible
massacres
that
had
taken
place
in
many
towns
and
villages
was
not
the
armenian
quarter
still
full
of
the
miserable
refugees
from
sassoun
who
had
come
there
during
the
past
winter
diseased
starving
wounded
sometimes
dying
and
with
horrible
tales
of
the
cruelties
they
and
theirs
had
suffered
it
was
agreed
on
all
hands
that
the
best
thing
jack
could
do
was
to
refer
his
case
to
the
lady
at
the
head
of
the
american
mission
whose
school
shushan
had
attended
we
shall
call
this
heroic
lady
who
is
happily
still
living
miss
celandine
she
thought
the
best
plan
would
be
to
bring
shushan
as
soon
as
she
was
married
back
to
urfa
in
disguise
since
under
her
charge
and
in
the
mission
premises
she
would
be
for
the
time
absolutely
safe
she
believed
the
english
consul
would
be
able
to
give
permission
for
the
marriage
without
being
personally
present
but
she
was
not
certain
as
to
where
the
consul
was
to
be
found
very
likely
he
was
at
the
baths
of
haran
the
season
being
august
and
very
hot
she
would
find
out
as
soon
as
possible
and
put
grayson
into
communication
with
him
two
or
three
days
later
jack
was
setting
out
with
one
of
the
young
vartonians
to
explore
the
hill
that
overhangs
urfa
and
to
visit
the
remains
of
the
ancient
citadel
and
the
other
interesting
ruins
with
which
it
is
strewn
when
kevork
meneshian
walked
in
as
soon
as
they
had
got
through
the
usual
salutations
barkev
vartonian
and
john
grayson
asked
him
together
what
has
brought
you
here
and
barkev
added
it
is
not
the
time
for
vacation
true
answered
the
young
man
smiling
i
did
very
wrong
to
come
away
and
i
am
very
glad
i
came
you
speak
in
a
riddle
said
jack
it
is
easily
read
when
pastor
stepanian
wife
died
the
news
came
by
telegraph
to
oriort
elmas
in
aintab
it
was
in
her
heart
to
go
home
at
once
to
her
father
and
her
young
brothers
who
must
need
her
sorely
but
what
a
journey
for
a
girl
and
a
girl
all
alone
with
only
khartijes
for
companions
and
protectors
only
think
of
it
four
long
days
on
horseback
and
three
nights
in
the
wayside
khans
and
then
the
perils
of
the
road
wild
kourds
everywhere
not
to
speak
of
other
robbers
more
treacherous
if
less
violent
i
could
not
have
it
so
i
told
no
one
but
just
wrote
a
note
of
apology
and
left
it
for
the
principal
slipped
out
without
waiting
for
leave
put
on
a
servant
dress
and
became
her
shadow
from
the
moment
her
lady
teacher
bade
farewell
to
her
in
aintab
until
she
fell
fainting
into
her
father
arms
here
in
urfa
last
night
a
proper
person
were
to
act
as
a
young
lady
guardian
said
barkev
laughing
i
did
not
say
i
said
kevork
returned
coolly
one
shadow
is
always
before
or
behind
so
i
took
care
to
keep
only
letting
her
know
i
there
if
i
was
wanted
there
were
many
ways
i
could
help
her
that
is
how
i
came
to
be
here
and
i
suppose
the
mission
folk
at
aintab
will
have
no
more
of
me
since
i
have
broken
all
their
rules
but
i
have
got
a
good
deal
of
their
learning
already
he
added
with
some
complacency
yon
effendi
how
are
my
father
and
my
mother
and
all
our
house
in
biridjik
for
we
did
not
stay
there
on
our
way
and
what
in
the
world
has
brought
here
jack
answered
his
questions
marvelling
the
while
at
the
mixture
in
his
character
shrewd
practical
and
almost
selfish
in
the
pursuit
of
his
ambition
as
he
used
to
think
him
he
had
served
elmas
stepanian
with
a
delicate
chivalry
of
which
any
lover
might
have
been
proud
i
think
said
barkev
you
would
do
well
to
go
to
the
badvellie
he
is
very
learned
and
might
give
you
the
lessons
you
have
missed
i
will
not
trouble
the
pastor
answered
kevork
with
decision
not
until
i
can
go
to
him
for
something
else
no
i
shall
beg
of
miss
celandine
to
give
me
work
teaching
the
boys
that
come
to
her
school
and
study
for
myself
in
the
evenings
you
get
on
said
barkev
approvingly
for
you
know
what
you
want
polished
stone
is
not
left
on
the
ground
i
might
in
any
other
country
but
lowering
his
voice
what
is
this
i
hear
of
fresh
massacres
oh
rumours
rumours
there
are
always
rumours
i
would
not
think
too
much
of
them
not
until
we
hear
more
you
may
well
talk
of
rumours
kevork
returned
some
of
the
things
people
say
are
past
thinking
for
foolishness
do
you
know
i
heard
in
aintab
that
some
people
say
in
europe
it
is
who
are
massacring
the
turks
as
if
we
even
suppose
we
would
without
firearms
or
weapons
of
any
kind
so
much
as
to
defend
ourselves
from
the
kourdish
robbers
good
for
to
think
of
killing
turks
be
striking
the
point
of
a
goad
with
one
fist
the
wolf
eats
the
lamb
and
cries
out
that
the
lamb
is
eating
him
said
barkev
but
he
added
glancing
round
apprehensively
is
there
any
talk
of
the
english
coming
to
help
us
much
talk
there
is
of
the
sultan
having
consented
moved
thereto
no
doubt
by
the
english
and
the
other
christians
to
grant
us
certain
privileges
we
do
not
want
privileges
said
barkev
we
want
we
want
security
for
our
lives
and
properties
and
above
all
for
our
women
well
that
is
what
these
reforms
are
intended
to
give
us
i
believe
in
them
when
i
see
a
moslem
punished
for
a
crime
against
one
of
and
that
is
what
my
grandfather
in
his
seven
and
eighty
years
has
never
seen
nor
i
think
will
little
nerses
who
is
not
weaned
yet
live
to
see
it
where
is
the
use
of
that
kind
of
talk
true
though
it
be
said
kevork
it
only
brings
trouble
the
heart
of
kevork
meneshian
was
not
just
then
attuned
to
trouble
the
deepest
gorges
of
the
alps
have
every
day
their
gleam
of
sunshine
though
it
be
but
for
one
short
hour
so
even
in
the
most
shadowed
lives
there
is
usually
some
brief
golden
moment
when
the
light
in
a
soft
eye
or
the
smile
on
a
dear
lip
is
more
than
the
fate
of
nations
or
of
empires
it
was
such
a
moment
now
with
kevork
and
it
ought
to
have
been
such
a
moment
with
john
grayson
only
for
him
it
was
love
itself
that
hung
suspended
in
the
balance
of
fate
fate
for
the
time
seemed
to
have
turned
against
him
the
ride
from
biridjik
to
urfa
had
been
done
at
headlong
speed
and
he
had
not
reached
his
destination
until
it
was
almost
noon
and
the
sun
heat
absolutely
overpowering
he
thought
his
miserable
sensations
afterwards
were
only
the
result
of
fatigue
and
kept
up
bravely
until
the
coming
of
kevork
when
he
had
to
own
to
overpowering
headache
and
feverish
alternations
of
heat
and
cold
he
just
managed
somehow
to
write
a
letter
to
the
consul
which
he
asked
the
vartonians
to
get
miss
celandine
to
forward
for
him
if
she
could
then
he
yielded
to
destiny
for
eight
days
he
tossed
in
fever
with
kevork
as
his
special
nurse
his
kind
hosts
also
giving
him
every
care
and
attention
in
their
power
once
the
fever
left
him
however
he
recovered
rapidly
his
good
constitution
strengthened
by
a
simple
and
healthy
life
coming
to
his
aid
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
be
about
again
he
said
he
would
go
to
the
mission
house
and
ask
miss
celandine
if
she
had
any
tidings
for
him
as
he
spoke
he
was
standing
near
one
of
the
few
windows
of
the
vartonian
house
which
looked
out
upon
the
street
something
he
saw
there
made
him
break
off
suddenly
pause
a
moment
then
utter
an
exclamation
of
pity
and
horror
what
is
it
asked
kevork
coming
to
the
window
followed
by
barkev
and
two
of
the
ladies
of
the
house
who
chanced
to
be
present
along
the
street
passed
slowly
by
twos
and
threes
in
a
straggling
procession
some
of
the
most
miserable
creatures
the
eye
of
man
has
ever
looked
upon
gaunt
half
famished
with
limbs
reduced
to
skin
and
bone
or
else
swollen
out
of
all
shape
by
disease
they
walked
on
with
uneven
tottering
footsteps
all
were
in
filthy
ragged
garments
some
had
rags
clotted
with
blood
tied
about
their
heads
or
their
arms
others
limped
along
with
the
aid
of
sticks
just
under
the
window
a
woman
dropped
in
the
street
and
lay
as
one
dead
the
man
who
was
walking
beside
her
stood
and
looked
without
doing
anything
to
help
how
could
he
both
his
hands
were
gone
the
three
young
men
ran
to
the
street
together
jack
proved
the
quickest
and
was
already
kneeling
on
the
ground
and
trying
to
raise
the
poor
woman
when
the
others
came
up
it
is
no
use
said
the
man
beside
her
in
a
dreary
almost
indifferent
tone
she
is
dead
i
do
know
that
said
jack
give
her
air
for
heaven
sake
kevork
keep
back
the
others
barkev
you
could
fetch
us
some
cordial
it
was
not
so
easy
to
obey
him
for
those
before
had
stopped
while
those
behind
came
crowding
up
and
with
the
strangers
a
few
armenians
of
the
town
one
of
these
pushed
through
the
rest
with
an
air
of
authority
make
way
good
people
he
said
i
am
a
doctor
he
did
not
seem
a
very
prosperous
member
of
the
fraternity
to
judge
by
his
dress
but
then
he
was
young
and
had
the
world
before
him
he
felt
the
woman
pulse
and
her
heart
and
said
presently
she
is
not
dead
but
she
soon
will
be
unless
she
gets
proper
care
and
nourishment
who
will
help
me
to
carry
her
into
my
dispensary
close
by
jack
volunteered
quite
forgetting
his
recent
illness
but
barkev
raised
an
objection
better
bring
her
to
the
mission
house
he
said
miss
celandine
has
food
and
medicine
and
will
take
good
care
of
her
miss
celandine
will
have
her
hands
full
besides
my
place
is
near
yes
sir
take
her
feet
he
nodded
to
jack
i
manage
the
rest
this
way
please
you
are
a
good
fellow
melkon
effendi
and
i
believe
you
are
right
said
barkev
his
attention
claimed
by
another
of
the
miserable
group
who
was
begging
in
god
name
for
a
bit
of
bread
as
they
had
eaten
nothing
for
several
days
but
grass
and
roots
jack
helped
melkon
to
lay
his
patient
on
the
surgery
table
and
watched
his
efforts
to
restore
animation
who
are
they
he
asked
the
young
doctor
answered
in
broken
phrases
without
stopping
his
work
from
one
of
the
villages
rhoumkali
fugitives
there
has
been
a
massacre
wholesale
of
our
people
by
turks
and
kourds
horrible
horrible
if
you
had
seen
the
sassoun
refugees
when
they
came
here
last
winter
you
might
talk
of
horror
i
believe
the
young
mission
lady
miss
fairchild
sacrificed
her
life
to
them
miss
fairchild
shushan
friend
is
she
dead
then
jack
asked
anxiously
they
sent
her
away
still
hanging
between
life
and
death
and
we
know
not
yet
which
will
conquer
but
as
for
massacres
there
here
not
in
a
great
city
like
this
not
here
surely
jack
said
but
the
villages
the
little
towns
like
biridjik
for
them
one
heart
trembles
he
added
his
thoughts
flying
to
shushan
she
is
coming
to
said
melkon
cheerfully
the
duty
of
the
moment
shutting
out
the
terrors
of
the
future
well
my
lad
what
do
want
this
to
a
youth
who
appeared
in
the
doorway
oh
i
see
you
are
one
of
baron
thomassian
people
and
come
just
in
time
to
fetch
what
i
want
i
am
out
of
these
drugs
and
he
handed
him
a
list
you
shall
have
them
melkon
effendi
said
the
young
man
but
my
business
now
is
with
the
other
gentleman
i
have
just
met
baron
barkev
vartonian
who
told
me
i
should
find
him
here
with
said
jack
a
little
excited
for
what
possible
business
could
thomassian
have
with
him
except
to
give
him
a
letter
from
england
or
at
least
a
letter
or
a
message
from
the
consul
with
you
sir
my
master
salutes
you
with
all
respect
and
begs
of
you
to
honour
his
poor
dwelling
with
a
visit
and
to
drink
his
black
coffee
still
under
the
same
impression
and
with
bright
visions
floating
before
him
of
bringing
his
young
bride
in
triumph
to
england
jack
only
waited
to
see
the
poor
woman
fully
restored
to
consciousness
and
to
give
melkon
a
little
money
to
supply
her
immediate
necessities
he
then
accompanied
the
youth
to
the
house
of
thomassian
leaving
a
message
on
his
way
for
the
vartonians
to
say
whither
he
had
gone
he
was
rewarded
with
the
first
specimen
of
genuine
oriental
wealth
and
splendour
he
had
seen
in
armenia
he
had
thought
the
house
of
the
vartonians
a
model
of
luxury
but
this
was
a
fairy
palace
muggurditch
thomassian
himself
in
a
faultless
european
costume
met
him
at
the
door
he
had
heard
nothing
of
his
illness
which
was
not
surprising
as
he
seldom
saw
his
kinsfolk
the
vartonians
he
explained
that
he
had
taken
the
freedom
of
asking
him
to
visit
him
at
the
earnest
request
of
his
wife
who
had
a
great
desire
to
see
an
englishman
once
more
she
is
from
constantinople
he
said
a
little
proudly
there
she
used
to
have
much
intercourse
with
the
franks
and
especially
with
the
english
whom
she
greatly
esteems
then
he
led
his
visitor
across
the
spacious
marble
court
with
its
beautiful
fountain
in
the
midst
its
bushes
laden
with
fragrant
roses
its
flowers
of
many
kinds
and
hues
some
of
them
which
were
rare
and
newly
brought
to
the
country
he
pointed
out
to
the
englishman
jack
admired
them
duly
and
expressed
the
satisfaction
he
would
have
in
waiting
on
the
madam
but
the
claims
of
courtesy
thus
fulfilled
he
could
not
help
adding
i
hoped
you
might
have
a
letter
to
give
me
from
my
friends
in
england
or
at
least
a
communication
from
the
consul
have
you
had
yourself
no
answer
to
your
letter
effendi
thomassian
asked
as
he
stopped
to
gather
for
his
guest
some
roses
he
had
particularly
admired
none
whatever
djanum
my
soul
a
common
exclamation
then
i
fear
it
must
have
gone
astray
in
the
post
you
know
how
often
unfortunately
that
happens
here
but
the
consul
jack
asked
eagerly
you
spoke
to
him
did
you
not
he
was
absent
when
i
went
to
aleppo
thomassian
answered
i
wrote
to
him
about
your
matters
but
i
fear
that
letter
may
have
miscarried
like
the
other
one
that
consul
is
always
jack
thought
despairingly
as
he
took
off
his
shoes
at
the
beautifully
carved
and
polished
door
that
led
to
the
apartment
of
the
ladies
he
found
himself
on
entering
in
a
large
room
heavy
with
perfume
silken
hangings
richly
embroidered
adorned
the
walls
silk
and
satin
cushions
of
all
colours
often
heavy
with
gold
and
silver
lay
about
in
profusion
the
only
other
furniture
the
room
contained
was
the
long
divan
which
occupied
one
side
of
it
and
upon
which
there
half
sat
and
half
reclined
a
very
handsome
lady
her
dress
was
of
the
costliest
materials
and
of
a
fashion
partly
eastern
and
partly
european
jack
made
the
usual
compliments
in
his
best
style
and
was
invited
to
sit
upon
luxurious
cushions
and
to
partake
of
choice
coffee
sherbet
and
sweetmeats
which
were
handed
to
him
on
silver
trays
by
pretty
girls
in
silk
zebouns
and
jackets
meanwhile
his
host
entertained
him
with
what
he
could
not
help
calling
in
his
disappointed
soul
vapid
and
uninteresting
commonplaces
the
lady
putting
in
now
and
then
a
languid
but
courteous
word
or
two
his
heart
full
of
his
own
perplexities
and
of
what
he
had
just
seen
of
the
wretched
fugitives
from
rhoumkali
he
began
a
question
about
the
massacres
there
but
his
host
with
a
warning
glance
directed
towards
his
wife
turned
the
conversation
immediately
jack
could
understand
his
not
wishing
to
alarm
her
or
to
wring
her
heart
with
terrible
details
especially
as
she
did
not
look
very
strong
but
the
time
seemed
long
to
him
and
as
soon
as
he
thought
it
consistent
with
good
manners
he
rose
to
take
his
leave
the
lady
called
one
of
her
attendants
and
gave
her
a
brief
direction
the
girl
left
the
room
and
speedily
returned
bearing
a
pretty
box
about
a
foot
square
covered
with
coloured
straw
wrought
in
patterns
will
you
do
me
a
kindness
mr
grayson
said
the
madam
will
you
take
charge
of
this
box
of
turkish
sweetmeats
from
constantinople
and
present
it
with
my
salutations
to
the
little
vartonians
the
cousins
of
my
husband
but
i
pray
you
take
toll
of
it
in
passing
open
the
box
and
eat
the
first
sweetmeat
yourself
as
she
said
this
her
dark
eyes
for
one
instant
met
and
the
english
blue
eyes
of
jack
grayson
the
next
she
was
bidding
him
with
perfect
eastern
courtesy
just
touched
with
the
dignified
nonchalance
of
the
typical
fine
lady
when
jack
was
once
more
alone
with
thomassian
he
spoke
again
of
the
horrors
of
rhoumkali
thomassian
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
very
dreadful
he
said
can
nothing
be
done
grayson
foolish
people
who
run
about
talking
of
things
they
do
not
understand
only
get
themselves
and
other
men
into
trouble
here
is
what
happens
many
a
time
there
is
some
wild
talk
going
of
help
from
england
or
some
such
nonsense
and
on
the
strength
of
it
some
fellow
kills
a
kourd
or
resists
a
zaptieh
and
then
all
hell
is
let
loose
upon
us
but
if
the
zaptieh
is
torturing
his
father
for
not
paying
a
tax
he
does
not
owe
or
giving
up
a
rifle
he
has
not
got
or
if
the
kourd
is
taking
well
you
know
what
i
mean
the
word
chokes
me
said
jack
thinking
of
shushan
let
be
let
be
is
silver
silence
is
golden
heart
of
the
fool
is
in
his
tongue
the
tongue
of
the
wise
man
is
in
his
mr
grayson
i
thank
you
for
honouring
me
with
a
visit
i
beg
of
you
to
salute
my
cousins
in
my
name
i
hope
old
father
hagop
cough
is
not
so
troublesome
now
and
how
is
the
little
one
does
he
begin
to
walk
yet
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
visiting
them
very
shortly
but
business
is
pressing
just
now
with
such
talk
as
this
he
led
jack
once
more
to
the
outer
door
and
he
as
he
took
his
final
leave
remembered
an
english
word
which
he
had
hardly
thought
of
since
he
left
the
shores
of
his
native
land
he
confessed
himself
decidedly
bored
as
soon
as
he
got
home
he
opened
the
box
of
sweetmeats
and
looked
anxiously
for
what
the
giver
might
mean
by
the
first
each
of
the
dainty
morsels
was
wrapped
up
separately
in
thin
paper
but
one
of
them
looked
on
close
inspection
as
if
the
paper
had
been
removed
and
then
carefully
replaced
he
took
it
off
and
found
traced
upon
it
in
very
fine
faint
handwriting
the
following
words
john
shushan
is
in
danger
the
chief
wife
of
mehmed
ibrahim
is
my
friend
she
does
not
wish
shushan
to
be
found
she
tells
me
mehmed
has
discovered
the
name
of
the
village
where
she
is
and
will
set
on
the
kourds
to
attack
it
and
to
make
her
a
prisoner
there
is
no
safe
place
for
her
except
the
house
of
the
american
missionaries
here
if
only
you
can
bring
her
to
it
secretly
in
some
disguise
for
the
turks
do
not
dare
to
enter
it
i
may
not
write
to
the
mission
ladies
myself
as
my
husband
forbids
me
to

any

with
them
therefore

us
part
oh
words
to
be
our
best
for
love
the
deathless
at
biridjik
in
the
house
of
hohannes
meneshian
and
in
the
very
room
where
john
grayson
had
caught
his
first
glimpse
of
armenian
domestic
life
two
women
sat
at
work
mariam
looking
old
and
careworn
was
behind
her
wheel
as
usual
shushan
was
bending
over
her
beautiful
embroidery
the
room
looked
much
barer
than
in
the
olden
days
most
of
the
curtains
and
rugs
had
disappeared
and
there
was
no
sign
of
any
cooking
in
progress
this
mattered
the
less
however
since
grapes
were
in
season
now
and
a
basket
of
great
luscious
clusters
lay
in
the
corner
destined
to
form
with
rye
bread
the
evening
meal
of
the
family
the
villagers
with
whom
shushan
had
been
staying
had
brought
her
home
the
day
before
she
was
no
longer
safe
with
them
a
kourd
who
had
shown
them
a
little
friendliness
and
to
whom
they
had
given
backsheesh
had
called
to
one
of
their
men
over
the
wall
of
the
vineyard
where
he
was
working
take
care
you
have
got
a
lily
our
sheikh
wants
to
gather
so
they
acted
on
the
hint
shushan
was
once
more
with
her
kindred
and
in
the
place
of
her
birth
but
little
joy
had
she
or
they
in
the
meeting
her
presence
was
a
danger
to
her
friends
she
was
hunted
from
place
to
place
like
a
partridge
the
dogs
start
from
its
cover
that
it
may
fall
by
the
gun
of
the
sportsman
happy
partridge
that
would
fall
at
once
gasp
its
little
life
out
on
the
grass
and
rest
no
such
rest
for
the
moslem
victim
more
than
once
indeed
across
the
sad
texture
of
shushan
life
there
had
shot
a
gleam
of
gold
she
had
been
a
happy
girl
in
urfa
when
she
went
with
her
cousins
to
the
mission
school
and
learned
beautiful
things
from
the
dear
foreign
ladies
there
afterwards
in
biridjik
for
a
little
while
she
had
been
still
happier
though
with
a
different
kind
of
happiness
the
brave
strong
splendid
english
youth
had
come
into
her
life
and
transfigured
it
he
had
saved
her
from
the
savage
dogs
he
had
done
a
still
more
wonderful
thing
than
that
he
had
come
to
her
help
in
her
direst
need
choosing
her
claiming
her
for
his
own
her
heart
throbbed
yet
with
the
fearful
rapture
of
that
day
the
of
her
short
life
the
day
of
her
betrothal
but
now
yon
effendi
was
gone
from
her
all
her
joy
seemed
to
have
melted
from
her
like
the
snow
on
the
mountains
like
the
dreams
of
the
night
it
had
left
instead
a
yearning
painful
in
its
sweetness
an
aching
unsatisfied
longing
for
him
who
was
its
core
and
its
centre
yon
effendi
was
gone
but
mehmed
ibrahim
whom
she
had
never
seen
yet
regarded
with
unutterable
dread
and
loathing
seemed
by
his
agents
and
instruments
to
be
ever
present
all
around
her
pressing
her
in
on
every
side
she
feared
death
far
less
than
she
feared
him
but
she
was
not
yet
quite
sixteen
and
since
she
had
known
yon
effendi
she
would
have
liked
to
live
the
pupil
of
the
mission
school
thought
more
clearly
and
felt
more
keenly
than
her
mother
who
had
never
had
her
chances
but
the
more
capacious
vessel
only
held
in
larger
measure
the
bitter
wine
of
pain
she
had
once
or
twice
to
turn
her
head
aside
lest
her
tears
should
fall
upon
the
work
she
was
doing
and
spoil
it
mother
she
said
at
last
i
think
if
god
willed
it
it
were
better
i
should
die
there
seems
no
place
in
the
world
for
me
child
it
is
wrong
to
speak
so
mariam
answered
we
must
live
in
the
world
as
long
as
god
pleases
to
go
out
of
it
by
our
own
act
were
a
sin
except
it
were
to
avoid
a
sin
said
shushan
gravely
raising
her
sad
eyes
to
her
mother
both
were
silent
for
a
moment
then
the
mother
spoke
again
daughter
before
you
went
away
you
used
to
tell
me
the
good
words
you
learned
in
the
school
i
liked
them
and
they
often
came
back
to
me
when
i
was
anxious
and
frightened
you
remember
how
sore
afraid
i
was
that
day
the
zaptiehs
came
for
the
taxes
thy
father
had
gabriel
tax
and
hagop
all
right
but
he
thought
kevork
would
be
paid
in
aintab
and
never
thought
of
getting
ready
to
pay
it
here
but
they
demanded
it
all
the
same
and
i
thought
surely
they
will
beat
or
torture
him
or
your
grandfather
because
we
have
it
not
but
i
remembered
that
word
you
told
me
from
the
letter
of
the
holy
peter
all
your
care
upon
him
for
he
careth
for
you
so
i
said
help
us
with
all
my
heart
and
he
did
for
though
they
found
and
took
away
all
our
rice
they
never
saw
the
barley
or
the
bulghour
so
we
have
that
to
live
upon
and
they
went
away
content
shushan
put
a
few
stitches
in
her
embroidery
before
she
answered
she
was
working
with
crimson
silk
the
deep
red
heart
of
a
rose
richly
the
colours
glowed
beneath
the
skilful
touch
of
her
slight
brown
fingers
but
out
of
her
own
life
all
the
colour
seemed
to
have
gone
and
now
it
was
the
strong
that
failed
and
leaned
upon
the
weaker
for
support
it
was
the
better
taught
that
turned
wistfully
to
the
simpler
for
words
of
cheer
oh
my
mother
she
said
my
heart
is
weary
my
heart
is
sad
sometimes
even
it
asks
of
me
and
gets
no
answer
he
care
for
us
armenians
does
he
care
for
armenians
not
only
from
the
trampled
land
herself
has
that
cry
gone
up
in
the
ears
of
the
lord
of
sabaoth
from
many
a
quiet
home
in
countries
far
away
wherever
the
tale
of
her
woes
has
come
it
has
echoed
and
strong
spirits
have
wrestled
over
it
with
god
in
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
even
until
the
breaking
of
the
day
tender
spirits
have
borne
it
as
a
terrible
and
undefined
secret
anguish
is
there
any
answer
except
this
one
what
i
do
thou
knowest
not
now
but
thou
shalt
know
hereafter
mariam
had
no
wise
words
of
comfort
to
give
her
child
but
she
had
the
mother
secret
of
love
which
so
often
is
better
than
wisdom
she
folded
shushan
tenderly
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
then
the
girl
recovered
a
little
i
ought
not
to
talk
so
to
you
mother
she
said
we
know
he
does
care
amaan
god
is
good
mariam
said
he
cares
for
every
one
even
i
suppose
for
the
turks
there
was
a
silence
during
which
mariam
resumed
her
spinning
and
shushan
her
embroidery
i
am
not
easy
about
the
grandfather
mariam
said
presently
i
wish
we
could
get
him
to
eat
a
little
more
since
the
fright
about
thee
and
the
loss
of
his
flocks
and
herds
he
has
scarcely
been
his
own
man
and
that
last
visit
of
the
zaptiehs
did
him
no
good
what
is
that
noise
in
the
court
some
one
has
come
the
whirr
of
the
spinning
wheel
ceased
and
shushan
dropped
her
work
growing
very
pale
neither
thought
of
going
forth
to
see
for
neither
expected
any
good
thing
to
come
to
them
shushan
would
have
hidden
herself
but
there
did
not
seem
time
so
they
sat
in
silence
listening
to
a
confused
babel
of
sounds
outside
but
presently
both
cried
at
once
the
voice
of
kevork
my
son
the
voice
of
yon
effendi
my
betrothed
cover
yourself
my
daughter
said
mariam
hastily
and
shushan
veiled
her
face
and
sat
still
where
she
was
while
the
mother
went
forth
to
welcome
her
son
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
more
than
eighteen
months
that
night
for
once
the
voice
of
joy
and
thankfulness
was
heard
in
the
house
of
hohannes
meneshian
jack
had
taken
kevork
into
council
over
the
communication
made
to
him
by
the
wife
of
thomassian
the
two
young
men
had
agreed
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
returning
to
biridjik
and
bringing
shushan
back
with
them
to
urfa
even
if
they
had
to
disguise
her
for
the
purpose
as
a
boy
thinking
the
knowledge
of
their
plan
might
imperil
the
vartonians
they
did
not
tell
them
of
it
they
told
no
one
in
fact
except
miss
celandine
whose
promise
to
receive
and
shelter
shushan
was
readily
given
jack
went
to
muggurditch
thomassian
and
asked
him
to
lend
him
a
sum
of
money
to
this
the
merchant
made
no
objection
for
he
felt
certain
the
young
englishman
would
eventually
have
funds
at
his
command
jack
gave
him
a
written
acknowledgment
and
promised
him
good
interest
requesting
him
at
the
same
time
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
the
vartonians
who
might
be
hurt
at
his
not
applying
to
them
in
the
first
instance
there
was
indeed
little
danger
of
his
doing
so
for
the
cousins
at
the
time
were
not
upon
friendly
terms
the
vartonians
like
other
armenians
rich
and
poor
had
contributed
liberally
to
the
needs
of
the
unfortunate
fugitives
from
rhoumkali
even
taking
some
of
them
into
their
house
they
were
indignant
with
their
wealthy
kinsman
who
had
given
a
handsome
subscription
to
the
cause
but
seemed
to
be
recouping
himself
by
heavy
charges
upon
the
drugs
and
medicines
supplied
to
the
sufferers
and
the
younger
members
of
the
family
expressed
very
freely
their
opinion
of
his
conduct
with
part
of
thomassian
money
jack
bought
kourdish
dresses
for
himself
and
for
kevork
and
also
a
smaller
one
fit
for
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
he
had
still
the
good
horses
upon
which
he
and
gabriel
had
ridden
to
urfa
after
a
sharp
conflict
with
himself
he
decided
not
to
wait
for
the
consul
communication
shushan
could
be
still
his
betrothed
as
such
he
and
kevork
could
bring
her
to
urfa
and
place
her
under
miss
celandine
protection
the
marriage
could
take
place
afterwards
however
to
his
great
delight
just
as
they
were
starting
the
necessary
papers
arrived
miss
celandine
influence
had
obtained
them
and
she
also
procured
for
the
travellers
a
zaptieh
to
guard
them
on
their
journey
they
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
the
vartonians
whom
they
told
simply
that
they
were
returning
to
biridjik
and
of
gabriel
now
an
ardent
and
delighted
pupil
in
the
missionary
school
their
journey
to
biridjik
was
without
adventure
on
the
way
they
agreed
together
that
they
would
not
say
much
to
their
friends
about
the
massacres
but
the
precaution
was
a
needless
one
for
already
they
knew
enough
as
it
was
september
and
very
hot
they
travelled
by
night
arriving
in
biridjik
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
the
remaining
hours
were
given
up
to
talk
to
rest
and
to
making
arrangements
for
the
future
in
spite
of
all
the
dangers
that
surrounded
them
kevork
could
not
be
unhappy
as
he
sat
with
his
mother
hand
in
his
his
father
looking
on
with
interest
and
his
brother
hagop
with
adoring
admiration
while
he
told
of
his
wonderful
eighteen
months
in
the
missionary
school
at
aintab
and
if
the
name
of
elmas
stepanian
slipped
sometimes
into
his
story
was
there
anything
wrong
in
that
did
he
not
see
her
every
sunday
in
church
and
did
he
not
hear
of
her
splendid
answering
at
the
examinations
and
of
the
prizes
she
gained
had
not
his
teacher
told
him
and
the
other
youths
about
it
that
they
might
be
stirred
to
emulation
by
the
grand
achievements
of
the
girls
for
jack
there
were
even
sweeter
joys
that
day
it
is
true
that
he
was
only
permitted
to
see
shushan
veiled
and
in
the
company
of
her
mother
or
of
some
of
the
other
women
still
he
could
whisper
a
few
words
of
cheer
about
the
home
they
hoped
to
have
in
free
happy
england
and
when
she
murmured
doubtfully
but
my
people
yon
effendi
he
said
the
whole
household
must
follow
them
to
england
there
kevork
could
find
a
career
the
younger
boys
an
education
and
all
of
them
peace
and
safety
and
bread
enough
and
to
spare
it
is
true
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
these
arrangements
would
have
seemed
to
him
in
his
sober
moments
almost
insurmountable
but
in
certain
moods
of
mind
we
take
small
account
of
difficulties
there
was
much
to
be
done
that
day
in
arranging
for
the
wedding
which
all
agreed
should
take
place
the
next
morning
according
to
custom
jack
ought
to
have
provided
the
dress
of
the
bride
but
this
under
the
circumstances
he
could
not
do
avedis
however
came
to
him
privately
bringing
a
beautiful
robe
of
blue
satin
with
long
sleeves
trimmed
with
gold
embroidery
you
know
he
said
i
was
to
have
married
alà
krikorian
sometimes
i
think
it
was
well
she
died
for
she
has
escaped
the
woes
that
are
coming
on
our
people
but
i
had
the
bridal
robe
all
ready
and
i
shall
never
marry
any
one
else
take
it
as
my
gift
to
you
give
it
yourself
to
shushan
and
god
bless
you
both
his
own
best
garments
jack
laid
ready
with
care
for
the
morning
rising
very
early
he
put
on
his
ordinary
clothes
and
went
forth
to
meet
der
garabed
who
came
by
appointment
to
bless
the
apparel
this
ceremony
accomplished
jack
arrayed
himself
for
the
wedding
and
with
hohannes
and
the
other
men
of
the
family
went
to
the
church
he
sat
in
his
own
place
on
the
men
side
shushan
coming
in
afterwards
with
her
mother
and
other
female
relatives
and
sitting
among
the
women
the
service
proceeded
as
usual
until
at
the
appointed
time
jack
with
a
beating
heart
stepped
out
of
his
place
and
came
and
stood
before
the
altar
shushan
also
was
led
to
the
spot
and
stood
there
beside
him
neither
dared
to
look
up
der
garabed
read
from
the
holy
book
of
the
first
bridal
in
paradise
and
again
from
its
later
pages
of
how
christian
wives
and
husbands
ought
to
love
and
cherish
one
another
then
as
they
turned
and
stood
face
to
face
each
for
one
instant
looked
into
the
other
eyes
and
read
there
the
secret
of
the
love
that
is
more
strong
than
death
they
had
to
clasp
hands
and
to
bow
their
heads
until
each
forehead
touched
the
other
old
hohannes
took
a
cross
from
the
hand
of
the
priest
and
his
own
trembling
with
many
emotions
laid
it
on
the
two
bowed
heads
the
priest
recited
a
few
prayers
and
put
the
solemn
questions
that
the
ritual
of
every
christian
church
prescribes
then
raising
their
bowed
heads
they
stood
together
with
the
right
before
god
and
man
to
stand
together
until
death
should
part
them
the
psalm
was
sung
and
the
benediction
given
and
john
grayson
led
forth
his
lily
all
his
at
last
there
was
deep
solemn
gladness
in
his
heart
he
felt
as
if
in
the
expressive
scottish
phrase
his
weird
was
won
peril
might
be
behind
them
before
them
all
around
them
yet
this
one
hour
must
be
given
to
joy
it
is
true
he
had
no
mother
to
crown
him
in
the
day
of
his
espousals
no
father
to
breathe
the
blessing
his
filial
heart
missed
so
sorely
still
he
believed
in
blessing
divine
and
human
his
faith
was
strong
his
hope
was
high
he
thought
it
would
be
no
hard
task
to
bring
his
bride
in
safety
to
his
english
home
and
hers
once
there
they
could
both
work
together
for
the
deliverance
of
her
people
people
was
what
john
grayson
thought
with
a
throb
of
joy
of
sympathy
and
is
it
strange
to
say
it
of
chapter
xi
an
adventurous
ride
what
if
we
still
ride
on
we
two
with
life
for
ever
old
yet
new
changed
not
in
kind
but
in
degree
the
instant
made
eternity
about
noon
kevork
came
to
jack
with
a
pale
anxious
face
you
see
the
state
men
minds
are
in
here
he
said
it
is
only
too
easy
to
see
jack
answered
did
you
notice
the
scared
faces
in
church
kevork
went
on
there
is
nothing
talked
of
here
among
our
own
people
but
death
and
massacre
and
among
the
turks
but
how
they
are
going
to
kill
us
and
take
all
we
have
and
our
own
house
is
in
the
greatest
danger
of
all
my
uncle
and
the
rest
are
afraid
we
will
be
held
accountable
for
shushan
and
heaven
knows
what
the
turks
will
do
to
us
when
they
find
she
is
gone
in
a
word
they
are
all
saying
that
if
you
go
to
urfa
and
take
her
with
you
the
whole
household
must
go
too
they
think
they
will
be
safer
there
lost
in
a
crowd
but
are
they
not
afraid
of
coming
so
near
mehmed
ibrahim
they
think
that
very
nearness
will
save
them
he
will
never
think
of
looking
for
them
at
his
own
door
one
and
all
at
least
are
quite
determined
to
go
except
perhaps
my
grandfather
who
is
rather
passive
about
it
and
my
father
who
is
doubtful
still
they
do
not
oppose
the
rest
my
grandfather
says
is
as
near
in
urfa
as
in
biridjik
very
good
said
jack
but
then
can
they
go
exclaimed
kevork
heaven
bless
you
it
will
take
them
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
to
get
ready
they
must
do
it
all
quietly
you
know
for
fear
of
the
turks
then
look
here
kevork
jack
said
with
a
determined
air
i
am
not
going
to
leave
shushan
in
this
place
another
day
the
rest
may
follow
as
they
like
you
are
right
kevork
answered
but
as
for
me
i
must
stay
think
of
it
here
are
souls
for
the
most
part
women
and
children
to
be
brought
to
urfa
and
not
one
of
them
has
been
twenty
miles
from
home
before
not
even
my
uncle
avedis
who
is
so
shrewd
and
clever
and
then
we
shall
have
to
make
all
our
preparations
and
to
sell
off
everything
we
can
but
with
the
greatest
secrecy
lest
the
turks
should
find
out
and
stop
us
yes
i
must
stay
you
shall
take
the
horses
jack
nodded
we
must
start
at
midnight
he
said
i
am
going
now
to
arrange
matters
and
to
tell
the
women
he
went
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
shushan
for
the
moment
alone
he
held
in
his
hand
a
large
bundle
which
he
laid
on
the
ground
beside
her
my
shushan
he
said
taking
her
hand
tenderly
i
know
you
trust
me
utterly
i
am
going
to
ask
you
for
a
proof
of
it
she
looked
up
at
him
and
her
eyes
said
for
her
but
prove
me
what
it
is
i
will
not
do
dearest
put
on
this
clothing
i
have
brought
kiss
your
father
and
your
mother
and
be
ready
at
midnight
to
ride
with
me
to
urfa
she
looked
at
the
garments
as
he
unfolded
them
with
an
involuntary
shudder
they
are
kourdish
clothes
she
said
jack
smiled
at
least
they
are
clean
he
answered
they
have
never
been
worn
and
there
is
no
law
that
i
know
of
against
sheep
in
clothing
oh
but
all
want
to
go
father
and
mother
and
hagop
all
of
us
they
shall
follow
us
my
shushan
but
to
leave
them
in
such
peril
and
yon
effendi
it
is
i
who
have
brought
it
on
them
not
altogether
my
beloved
now
it
is
not
one
here
and
there
who
is
persecuted
the
danger
threatens
your
whole
race
race
he
said
with
a
sudden
throb
of
the
passionate
pitying
love
that
was
springing
up
in
his
heart
for
the
people
of
his
adoption
without
you
he
added
their
danger
certainly
will
be
less
and
if
god
wills
we
will
all
meet
again
in
urfa
i
will
do
what
you
tell
me
my
husband
shushan
said
and
the
words
if
low
were
quite
steady
the
whole
trust
of
her
simple
heart
was
his
and
although
tender
modest
refined
it
was
still
a
hot
impulsive
eastern
heart
at
midnight
a
group
assembled
in
the
courtyard
of
the
meneshians
house
there
was
no
moon
all
the
better
for
their
purpose
but
from
the
cloudless
sky
the
great
beautiful
stars
shone
down
upon
them
avedis
brought
out
a
lantern
which
showed
two
strange
figures
in
the
midst
stood
a
young
kourdish
warrior
his
head
protected
by
a
gay
kafieh
of
yellow
silk
bound
about
it
with
rolls
of
wool
and
having
the
front
thrown
back
to
reveal
the
face
which
was
nearly
as
dark
as
a
mulatto
his
zeboun
was
of
bright
scarlet
and
it
boasted
instead
of
a
skirt
four
separate
tails
or
aprons
which
showed
beneath
them
turkish
trousers
of
crude
and
staring
blue
while
a
crimson
belt
contained
the
perilous
revolver
its
two
available
barrels
loaded
it
was
not
necessary
now
to
conceal
it
for
it
was
part
of
the
equipment
a
kourdish
boy
attired
in
similar
fashion
and
with
face
and
hands
yet
more
carefully
blackened
clung
to
the
breast
of
mariam
as
if
they
could
never
part
come
my
daughter
boghos
said
at
last
the
moments
are
precious
is
not
as
if
the
parting
were
a
long
one
kevork
said
cheerfully
a
few
weeks
at
most
and
we
follow
you
to
urfa
as
we
stand
now
old
hohannes
said
solemnly
parting
may
be
as
long
as
life
or
death
but
we
christians
are
not
afraid
of
death
shushan
my
lily
in
christ
name
i
bless
thee
and
bid
thee
shushan
had
been
given
into
his
arms
by
her
mother
and
now
her
father
stood
waiting
for
the
last
embrace
as
he
gave
it
with
eyes
jack
turned
to
hohannes
you
have
been
as
a
father
to
me
he
said
bless
me
also
as
a
son
in
a
broken
voice
the
old
armenian
spoke
the
words
of
blessing
the
englishman
bowed
his
young
head
in
reverence
then
shook
hands
with
the
others
and
turned
to
lift
into
her
saddle
the
shrinking
girl
in
her
boy
attire
next
he
sprang
lightly
upon
his
own
horse
which
kevork
was
holding
for
him
he
said
stooping
down
to
wring
his
hand
slowly
and
silently
they
moved
along
the
good
horses
climbing
the
terraces
that
led
out
of
the
town
a
bribe
cleverly
administered
beforehand
by
hohannes
who
had
a
practice
in
these
matters
opened
to
them
the
ancient
gate
of
biridjik
and
they
found
themselves
in
the
road
outside
softly
softly
jack
whispered
stroking
the
neck
of
his
steed
who
seemed
quite
to
understand
him
he
wondered
if
in
this
strange
country
even
the
dumb
creatures
learned
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
exigencies
of
a
hunted
life
both
their
horses
might
almost
have
been
shod
with
felt
for
all
the
noise
they
made
when
the
terraces
and
gardens
were
left
behind
a
running
stream
or
two
had
to
be
crossed
and
they
found
themselves
beside
the
ancient
reservoir
which
supplied
the
town
with
water
after
passing
this
they
came
to
a
place
where
three
roads
met
and
where
a
turkish
guard
was
always
stationed
this
was
a
serious
danger
he
might
demand
their
passports
and
they
had
none
what
shall
we
do
if
he
does
shushan
whispered
jack
pointed
to
his
purse
but
happily
the
turk
gave
them
no
trouble
being
fast
asleep
in
his
little
booth
by
the
roadside
when
they
got
into
the
open
country
their
road
lay
over
rocks
which
rang
to
the
feet
of
their
horses
at
first
the
sound
almost
scared
them
used
as
they
were
to
fear
but
for
the
present
in
all
the
wide
landscape
there
was
no
one
to
hear
and
nothing
to
dread
they
rode
out
into
the
still
night
no
mist
no
dew
the
stars
flashing
down
the
great
planets
bright
enough
to
cast
perceptible
shadows
the
brilliant
shimmering
starlight
lent
the
campaign
a
beauty
not
its
own
there
was
a
kind
of
glamour
over
everything
jack
spirits
rose
with
the
sense
of
freedom
and
solitude
he
and
shushan
put
their
horses
at
full
speed
and
they
seemed
to
be
flying
through
the
clear
still
air
not
cold
but
cool
enough
after
the
hot
day
to
be
refreshing
are
you
frightened
love
are
we
going
too
fast
for
you
he
asked
hearing
a
little
sigh
and
slackening
his
pace
accordingly
no
but
i
never
rode
like
this
before
when
cousin
thomassian
brought
me
to
biridjik
it
was
a
turkish
word
which
may
be
rendered
in
english
take
it
easy
do
you
like
it
my
lily
i
like
it
well
she
answered
breathless
but
rejoicing
go
on
fast
again
i
like
it
well
did
jack
like
it
there
was
a
light
in
his
eye
a
bounding
rapture
in
his
every
vein
as
they
flew
along
alone
with
each
other
in
that
desolate
waste
which
to
them
was
as
the
garden
of
eden
after
a
while
they
drew
rein
again
that
they
might
talk
they
tell
me
jack
spoke
dreamily
out
of
a
depth
of
delight
they
tell
me
the
garden
of
eden
was
in
this
land
of
yours
so
our
fathers
say
shushan
answered
and
it
is
lovely
enough
at
least
in
spring
when
the
flowers
are
out
if
only
we
were
not
afraid
always
that
was
what
struck
me
jack
said
when
after
my
long
illness
i
began
to
get
strong
and
to
notice
what
went
on
about
me
always
over
every
one
there
seemed
to
hang
the
shadow
of
a
great
fear
but
i
suppose
in
your
england
also
there
are
sin
and
sorrow
a
great
deal
of
both
my
lily
but
in
england
law
is
wickedness
and
cruelty
and
stops
them
if
it
can
then
there
is
the
same
law
in
england
for
all
there
are
not
two
kinds
of
people
one
booted
and
spurred
to
ride
and
the
other
bridled
and
saddled
to
be
ridden
it
took
me
a
good
while
to
understand
that
was
the
case
here
and
i
was
among
the
bridled
and
saddled
because
you
were
not
born
here
you
know
yon
effendi
we
always
to
suffer
because
we
are
christians
ever
since
i
can
remember
every
one
was
afraid
afraid
of
the
turks
in
the
street
afraid
of
the
kamaikan
afraid
of
the
zaptiehs
afraid
of
the
kourds
kevork
and
i
were
great
companions
but
i
do
not
think
we
played
much
sometimes
i
played
with
the
little
ones
but
i
liked
better
to
help
my
mother
or
to
hear
the
talk
of
the
elders
then
came
the
dreadful
time
when
mehmed
ibrahim
our
kamaikan
do
talk
of
it
you
shall
never
see
his
face
again
my
shushan
i
never
have
seen
it
to
my
knowledge
i
was
only
ten
years
old
when
a
little
english
girl
would
still
be
playing
with
her
doll
as
my
cousins
used
to
do
poor
child
my
childhood
ended
then
they
sent
me
to
urfa
with
some
merchants
from
our
town
who
were
going
there
oh
i
was
happy
there
i
had
the
school
and
the
dear
foreign
ladies
and
my
cousins
the
vartonians
and
above
all
elmas
stepanian
do
you
know
my
lily
that
kevork
loves
elmas
just
a
little
bit
in
the
way
i
love
you
how
could
he
help
it
shushan
said
and
smiled
quietly
in
the
school
she
went
on
i
learned
many
things
about
the
bible
and
about
our
dear
lord
that
i
did
not
know
before
though
i
think
i
always
loved
him
they
helped
me
to
understand
why
all
the
troubles
came
to
us
has
he
not
said
the
world
ye
shall
have
tribulation
but
he
has
said
also
am
with
you
always
if
one
is
true
so
must
the
other
be
yes
said
jack
thoughtfully
i
think
i
can
believe
it
now
it
all
seemed
so
real
in
the
happy
years
at
school
and
afterwards
when
i
first
came
back
to
biridjik
i
felt
as
if
all
day
long
he
was
close
by
me
and
then
all
the
fear
went
out
of
my
heart
there
was
no
room
for
it
when
he
was
there
jack
was
silent
he
feared
god
prayed
to
him
devoutly
and
desired
sincerely
to
do
his
will
but
this
experience
of
his
personal
presence
and
nearness
was
beyond
him
as
yet
but
i
could
not
help
seeing
how
things
went
on
about
me
shushan
resumed
and
for
a
year
and
more
we
have
been
hearing
of
worse
things
yet
i
did
not
talk
of
them
for
what
was
the
use
of
frightening
everybody
we
could
do
nothing
we
were
helpless
but
they
sank
into
my
heart
then
the
horror
about
mehmed
ibrahim
came
again
i
began
to
think
god
had
forsaken
us
do
you
know
the
sad
things
about
that
in
the
psalms
they
seem
just
written
for
us
now
thou
art
far
off
and
puttest
us
to
confusion
so
that
they
that
hate
us
spoil
our
goods
thou
lettest
us
be
eaten
up
like
sheep
thou
sellest
thy
people
for
nought
and
takest
no
money
for
them
thou
makest
us
to
be
rebuked
of
our
neighbours
to
be
laughed
to
scorn
and
had
in
derision
of
them
that
are
round
about
us
for
thy
sake
also
we
are
killed
all
the
day
long
and
are
counted
as
sheep
appointed
to
be
slain
oh
shushan
stop
it
is
too
sad
only
one
word
more
lord
why
sleepest
thou
awake
and
be
not
absent
from
us
for
ever
wherefore
hidest
thou
thy
face
and
forgettest
our
misery
and
trouble
that
was
what
i
feared
that
he
forgot
that
he
did
not
care
shushan
head
bent
low
jack
stretched
his
hand
out
to
touch
hers
she
raised
her
head
and
turning
her
face
to
his
in
the
dim
light
said
he
did
not
forget
he
sent
me
you
and
it
is
not
likely
he
has
remembered
shushan
meneshian
and
forgotten
all
the
rest
in
talk
like
this
passing
gradually
into
lighter
topics
they
rode
along
now
fast
now
slow
shushan
little
accustomed
to
riding
save
to
the
vineyard
on
a
donkey
grew
very
tired
though
she
would
not
have
confessed
it
for
worlds
they
had
a
mountain
gorge
to
go
through
where
the
narrow
path
only
wide
enough
for
one
winds
along
the
mountain
side
a
slope
above
a
deeper
slope
almost
a
precipice
beneath
one
false
step
and
the
unlucky
traveller
would
lie
a
mangled
corpse
in
the
rocky
gulf
below
they
had
only
starlight
to
guide
them
and
the
mountain
on
the
other
side
increased
the
obscurity
trust
your
horse
my
shushan
jack
said
horse
sense
is
better
here
than
ours
shushan
did
so
and
though
she
trembled
no
cry
no
word
of
fear
passed
her
lips
only
she
murmured
the
favourite
prayer
of
her
people
hesoos
okné
menk
jesus
help
us
her
prayer
was
heard
they
emerged
safely
from
the
perilous
gorge
then
presently
in
the
soft
starlight
there
fell
upon
their
ears
a
perfect
burst
of
song
sweet
liquid
notes
rising
and
falling
in
thrills
and
gushes
of
delicious
melody
that
seemed
to
fill
the
air
around
them
the
nightingale
shushan
whispered
listen
oh
listen
hitherto
not
a
tree
had
relieved
the
monotony
of
the
waste
and
dreary
path
which
indeed
was
rather
a
mule
track
than
a
road
now
they
were
drawing
near
a
couple
of
stunted
one
of
which
gave
a
shelter
to
the
sweet
songster
there
is
a
well
here
jack
said
kevork
tells
me
travellers
always
rest
and
sup
or
breakfast
as
the
case
may
be
beside
it
ah
there
it
is
he
sprang
from
his
horse
and
helped
shushan
down
from
hers
then
he
spread
the
saddle
cloths
beneath
her
on
the
ground
and
took
from
the
small
bag
strapped
beside
him
on
the
horse
the
viands
it
contained
bread
white
delicious
cheese
in
small
squares
apples
pears
and
peaches
he
had
with
him
his
father
little
flask
and
cup
one
of
the
few
things
that
had
escaped
the
rapacity
of
the
syrians
and
they
needed
no
better
beverage
than
the
cold
pure
water
with
which
the
well
supplied
them
very
happily
they
ate
and
drank
together
in
the
starlight
shushan
refused
the
last
peach
saying
no
more
i
thank
you
yon
effendi
my
lily
must
not
call
me
that
again
english
wives
do
not
speak
so
to
their
husbands
john
how
odd
it
would
sound
i
think
it
has
a
very
pleasant
sound
no
dearest
you
must
call
me
as
my
father
used
shack
oh
that
is
so
short
so
little
of
a
name
for
a
great
tall
effendi
like
you
but
i
love
it
best
shushan
and
i
will
love
it
oh
so
much
better
when
i
hear
it
from
lips
now
i
will
say
it
shack
not
like
which
you
say
quite
right
i
will
say
that
quite
right
too
do
you
think
we
ought
to
ride
on
shack
not
those
naughty
lips
of
yours
shushan
must
pay
me
a
fine
when
they
miscall
me
so
he
exacted
the
fine
promptly
saying
i
have
the
right
you
know
nevertheless
shushan
adhered
to
the
name
of
shack
which
she
softened
until
it
sounded
like
the
french
jacques
evidently
she
thought
the
harsher
sound
uncouth
if
not
disrespectful
but
do
you
think
we
ought
to
ride
on
she
resumed
presently
in
three
or
four
hours
we
shall
come
to
that
queer
little
village
with
the
black
mud
huts
charmelik
that
is
the
name
the
people
are
kourds
and
will
want
to
talk
to
us
what
shall
we
do
you
do
not
know
kourdish
any
more
than
i
no
but
i
know
turkish
some
kourdish
tribes
speak
turkish
and
we
can
give
them
to
understand
we
come
from
one
of
these
i
will
talk
for
us
both
said
shushan
whose
courage
was
rising
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
her
life
jack
as
yet
knew
only
the
few
words
of
turkish
he
could
not
fail
to
pick
up
in
a
town
partly
inhabited
by
turks
like
biridjik
they
will
think
that
odd
he
said
unless
i
were
deaf
and
dumb
deaf
and
dumb
then
she
answered
after
a
thoughtful
pause
you
are
going
to
urfa
to
be
cured
by
a
wise
frank
hakim
there
and
i
your
young
brother
go
with
you
to
be
ears
and
tongue
to
you
a
splendid
notion
jack
said
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
had
occasion
to
admire
the
armenian
quickness
of
resource
and
dexterity
in
eluding
danger
these
were
nature
weapons
of
defence
developed
by
environment
and
the
survival
of
the
fittest
yet
they
had
their
own
perils
does
the
world
recognise
how
hard
nay
how
impossible
it
is
for
oppressed
and
persecuted
races
to
be
absolutely
truthful
just
as
they
rode
on
the
glorious
sun
shot
up
with
tropical
splendour
and
tropical
swiftness
it
was
late
september
now
the
heat
was
still
great
and
the
travellers
were
not
sorry
when
at
last
they
saw
in
the
distance
the
black
huts
of
charmelik
the
walls
of
the
khan
and
the
minaret
of
the
little
mosque
shushan
in
spite
of
her
fatigue
seemed
to
have
changed
places
with
jack
she
planned
and
exhorted
he
listened
to
her
meekly
for
fighting
the
englishman
comes
to
the
front
for
feigning
the
armenian
now
i
pray
of
you
yon
effendi
that
is
shack
remember
you
are
not
to
speak
and
also
which
is
harder
you
are
not
to
not
if
a
pistol
goes
off
close
to
your
head
you
may
talk
to
me
by
signs
or
on
your
fingers
jack
gave
his
promise
and
as
both
their
lives
depended
on
it
he
was
likely
to
keep
it
at
first
they
thought
the
khan
might
be
safer
to
stay
in
than
the
huts
but
a
caravan
from
urfa
had
just
stopped
there
and
both
the
open
enclosure
and
the
rooms
round
it
if
rooms
they
may
be
called
were
quite
full
moreover
the
kourds
of
the
village
came
about
them
with
welcomes
and
questions
and
offers
of
hospitality
so
jack
gathered
from
their
looks
and
gestures
he
stood
among
them
gazing
about
him
with
as
vacant
an
expression
of
face
as
he
could
manage
to
assume
only
praying
they
might
not
be
rough
with
shushan
for
such
a
set
of
savages
as
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
before
although
of
course
since
coming
to
the
country
he
had
seen
many
kourds
after
a
while
shushan
touched
him
and
motioned
to
him
to
come
with
her
one
of
the
kourds
led
them
to
a
hut
and
as
it
appeared
by
his
looks
and
gestures
invited
them
to
consider
it
their
own
mansion
with
the
same
magnificent
air
with
which
a
spanish
grandee
might
have
said
this
is
your
own
house
señor
as
soon
as
he
had
attended
to
their
horses
and
brought
in
the
saddle
cloths
jack
surveyed
the
miserable
hovel
some
twelve
feet
in
diameter
and
with
no
furniture
save
a
couple
of
dirty
mats
and
cushions
and
wished
with
all
his
heart
for
a
decent
english
you
get
a
sleep
shushan
he
said
aloud
but
how
i
am
ever
to
make
you
comfortable
here
shushan
breathed
rather
than
spoke
with
a
warning
hand
laid
upon
his
arm
well
said
jack
speaking
low
but
surprised
at
her
evident
alarm
she
pointed
to
the
one
little
unglazed
hole
in
the
mud
wall
that
served
as
a
window
they
sit
under
that
and
listen
she
said
i
know
their
ways
after
that
only
low
whispers
were
exchanged
a
meal
of
pillav
with
kabobs
little
pieces
of
roast
meat
was
served
to
them
by
their
hosts
who
were
presently
as
shushan
ascertained
with
much
relief
going
in
a
body
to
some
neighbouring
vineyard
to
cut
grapes
when
they
had
finished
eating
jack
spread
the
two
horse
cloths
for
shushan
and
exhorted
her
to
lie
down
and
sleep
he
thought
he
was
far
too
anxious
to
do
so
himself
he
sat
up
manfully
near
the
door
with
his
back
against
the
wall
for
fear
of
a
sudden
surprise
but
nature
in
the
end
was
too
strong
for
him
and
even
in
that
unrestful
position
she
managed
to
steep
his
senses
in
a
profound
slumber
chapter
xii
the
use
of
a
revolver
so
let
it
be
in
god
own
might
we
gird
us
for
the
coming
fight
it
was
shushan
who
awoke
her
guardian
near
the
going
down
of
the
sun
shack
she
whispered
let
us
get
the
horses
and
begone
i
like
not
the
looks
of
these
people
some
of
them
have
come
back
from
the
vineyard
and
i
saw
them
looking
in
at
the
window
and
whispering
jack
shook
himself
so
i
have
slept
he
said
surprised
i
did
not
mean
it
what
time
is
it
they
ate
of
the
provisions
they
had
with
them
went
together
to
make
ready
the
horses
bestowed
some
silver
on
their
hosts
and
rode
away
as
soon
as
they
were
really
off
jack
asked
shushan
if
she
thought
the
kourds
were
content
with
their
backsheesh
oh
yes
content
enough
she
said
still
i
do
not
like
their
looks
let
us
ride
on
as
fast
as
we
can
they
had
some
hard
riding
over
the
bare
ground
where
not
a
blade
of
grass
or
a
leaf
of
any
green
thing
was
to
be
seen
and
then
they
came
again
to
a
mountain
gorge
the
sun
had
gone
down
now
a
great
relief
for
it
had
been
very
hot
shushan
who
had
scarcely
slept
at
all
was
suffering
much
from
fatigue
and
though
she
tried
to
answer
cheerfully
when
jack
spoke
to
her
she
was
evidently
depressed
and
anxious
he
asked
tenderly
what
was
troubling
her
nothing
she
said
nothing
at
least
that
i
ought
to
mind
this
morning
one
of
those
kourds
asked
me
if
we
had
come
down
from
the
mountains
to
help
in
killing
the
giaours
and
to
get
some
of
their
goods
i
asked
why
we
should
kill
them
when
they
have
done
us
no
harm
and
they
asked
me
again
where
i
had
come
from
that
i
did
not
know
it
was
the
will
of
allah
and
the
sultan
and
that
the
true
believers
who
helped
in
the
holy
work
were
to
have
their
gold
and
silver
and
all
they
possessed
then
they
began
a
story
that
made
my
blood
run
cold
i
will
not
tell
it
thee
but
shack
i
fear
the
worst
especially
for
my
people
in
biridjik
let
us
ride
on
said
jack
after
a
sorrowful
pause
it
will
not
do
for
us
to
stop
and
think
and
certainly
not
here
the
darkness
or
rather
the
soft
of
the
starry
eastern
night
had
fallen
over
them
quickly
like
a
veil
and
now
they
were
getting
among
the
mountains
and
the
wretched
track
called
a
road
was
growing
more
and
more
indistinct
presently
they
entered
another
narrow
gorge
deeper
and
gloomier
than
the
one
before
charmelik
but
for
their
dependence
on
their
horses
they
never
could
have
faced
it
so
narrow
was
the
level
track
so
steep
the
precipice
below
so
dark
and
frowning
the
heights
on
either
side
above
them
but
even
the
horses
seemed
to
get
puzzled
the
track
became
fainter
and
more
broken
until
at
last
the
travellers
found
themselves
on
sloping
ground
where
it
was
hard
to
secure
a
foothold
not
all
shushan
could
keep
back
a
little
frightened
cry
i
shall
fall
hold
me
shack
jack
turned
to
help
her
heard
the
slip
of
a
horse
foot
in
the
dry
loose
clay
and
for
one
awful
moment
thought
both
were
lost
however
foothold
was
regained
somehow
and
shushan
fervent
park
derocha
gave
him
strength
to
breathe
again
and
to
look
about
him
he
saw
distinctly
before
them
another
gorge
crossing
almost
at
right
angles
the
one
beneath
them
and
cutting
off
their
path
as
it
seemed
to
him
how
were
they
to
traverse
it
how
had
it
been
done
before
when
he
rode
in
hot
haste
with
the
zaptiehs
and
the
post
or
back
again
with
kevork
and
where
was
the
path
itself
from
which
they
had
wandered
he
knew
not
how
far
great
jupiter
shone
above
them
bright
enough
to
outline
their
forms
in
shadow
on
the
bare
brown
earth
and
looking
carefully
he
had
light
to
discern
a
narrow
crooked
thread
of
white
winding
some
thirty
feet
below
their
standing
place
he
pointed
to
it
we
must
get
back
he
said
shushan
drew
her
breath
hard
and
looked
not
at
the
perilous
slope
but
at
yes
she
said
jack
would
have
proposed
to
dismount
trust
to
their
feet
and
let
the
horses
follow
but
he
knew
it
was
not
best
he
knew
too
that
he
must
restrain
his
longing
to
take
shushan
bridle
and
lead
her
horse
was
not
best
either
how
she
held
on
he
did
not
know
nor
did
she
know
herself
they
were
getting
down
the
steep
incline
with
less
difficulty
than
they
expected
and
had
nearly
regained
the
path
when
shushan
cried
out
suddenly
shack
i
hear
shouts
in
another
moment
horse
and
rider
both
were
on
the
ground
jack
could
not
tell
until
the
end
of
his
life
what
happened
next
or
what
he
did
until
he
found
himself
sitting
on
the
path
with
shushan
head
in
his
lap
seeing
nothing
but
her
face
white
through
its
dark
staining
her
horse
had
narrowly
escaped
slipping
down
into
the
gorge
but
had
found
his
feet
somehow
and
now
stood
beside
jack
gazing
solemnly
at
the
two
dismounted
riders
happily
jack
had
his
flask
in
his
wide
sash
he
got
at
it
sprinkled
shushan
face
with
the
water
and
put
some
between
her
lips
after
a
few
moments
it
seemed
like
an
age
she
looked
up
he
began
to
lavish
tender
words
and
caresses
upon
her
asking
anxiously
if
she
was
hurt
but
she
stopped
him
quickly
oh
what
does
it
matter
she
said
listen
shack
he
had
been
deaf
as
well
as
blind
to
all
except
her
state
now
he
listened
the
mountain
echoes
rang
with
wild
discordant
shouts
the
kourds
they
are
pursuing
us
said
shushan
sitting
up
terror
had
restored
her
senses
more
rapidly
than
all
the
arts
of
love
could
have
done
another
set
of
them
asked
jack
bewildered
no
the
kourds
of
charmelik
said
shushan
in
a
frightened
whisper
i
feared
it
they
heard
us
speak
and
knew
we
were
no
kourds
even
in
that
moment
agony
she
said
heard
us
speak
as
jack
remembered
afterwards
lest
he
should
blame
himself
i
will
run
round
the
corner
and
look
he
said
do
you
fear
a
moment
alone
my
shushan
no
but
take
care
keep
under
cover
of
the
hill
jack
ran
to
a
turn
that
gave
him
a
view
of
the
road
from
charmelik
as
far
as
he
could
see
along
the
track
no
creature
was
visible
but
high
up
on
the
hill
he
saw
dark
forms
descending
doubtless
by
some
known
to
themselves
alone
they
could
reach
shushan
almost
as
soon
as
he
could
he
tore
back
to
her
possessed
with
the
thought
that
he
would
set
her
on
horseback
and
make
a
race
for
it
but
when
he
came
near
he
saw
their
horses
had
moved
away
and
were
both
out
of
sight
the
shouts
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
he
saw
the
flash
of
a
gun
and
heard
the
report
shack
said
shushan
she
was
still
sitting
on
the
ground
having
sprained
her
ankle
in
the
fall
shack
he
bent
down
to
her
he
had
been
looking
to
his
revolver
and
held
it
in
his
hand
if
the
worst
comes
she
said
you
will
kill
me
with
that
promise
jack
set
his
teeth
for
an
instant
then
he
said
firmly
so
help
me
god
another
pistol
shot
not
near
enough
to
harm
them
but
the
kourds
were
upon
them
now
jack
saw
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
given
them
his
hut
an
evil
face
he
took
aim
fired
and
the
kourd
fell
in
a
heap
and
rolled
down
the
sloping
ground
to
his
very
feet
but
there
were
twenty
following
him
and
most
of
them
had
guns
while
jack
had
no
other
shot
he
stood
at
bay
between
his
wife
and
the
robbers
keeping
his
hand
on
the
revolver
as
if
just
about
to
fire
the
kourds
desire
close
quarters
with
a
dead
shot
as
little
as
other
men
they
wavered
hesitated
presently
one
fellow
braver
than
the
rest
discharged
his
gun
the
shot
passing
close
to
jack
head
then
sprang
down
the
slope
and
flung
himself
upon
him
they
closed
in
mortal
conflict
hand
to
hand
foot
to
foot
eye
to
eye
at
last
jack
turned
suddenly
dragged
his
foe
to
the
edge
of
the
abyss
tore
himself
loose
with
one
tremendous
effort
and
with
another
flung
him
over
down
down
down
still
down
he
rolled
and
fell
fell
and
rolled
till
he
lay
a
mangled
heap
amongst
the
boulders
at
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
jack
would
assuredly
have
followed
him
had
he
not
fallen
or
rather
thrown
himself
backwards
at
full
length
on
the
path
as
he
lay
there
two
or
three
bullets
whizzed
over
him
they
were
the
last
salute
of
the
departing
foe
the
kourds
by
this
time
had
had
enough
of
it
and
beat
a
retreat
more
rapid
than
their
advance
when
they
found
out
their
guests
were
not
what
they
appeared
to
be
brethren
from
a
distant
tribe
they
had
supposed
they
might
be
armenians
carrying
communications
from
the
revolted
zeitounlis
to
urfa
and
that
therefore
they
would
be
worth
intercepting
but
now
they
came
to
the
conclusion
they
were
too
well
armed
to
be
molested
any
further
it
was
long
before
jack
and
shushan
dared
to
breathe
again
park
derocha
said
shushan
at
last
thank
god
jack
responded
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
looking
anxiously
around
to
see
that
all
was
safe
shack
said
shushan
presently
my
foot
hurts
dreadfully
now
praised
be
the
lord
jack
had
no
linen
but
he
tore
his
sash
poured
on
it
all
the
water
remaining
in
his
flask
and
wrapped
it
round
the
ankle
which
was
beginning
to
swell
i
meant
that
word
shushan
added
smiling
for
pain
is
not
felt
until
danger
is
past
and
danger
is
oh
so
much
worse
than
pain
but
shack
the
horses
true
we
must
get
them
i
daresay
they
have
not
gone
far
dare
i
leave
you
here
while
i
go
to
look
for
them
you
our
lives
hang
on
it
god
will
take
care
of
me
jack
drew
her
gently
into
a
sheltered
place
under
the
rock
then
he
set
off
at
a
brisk
run
not
letting
himself
think
there
was
danger
for
her
since
he
to
go
and
yet
intensely
cruelly
anxious
about
her
he
had
a
much
longer
chase
than
he
anticipated
for
the
horses
had
quite
disappeared
from
view
still
he
went
on
keeping
the
path
and
uttering
now
and
then
the
calls
they
were
sure
to
recognise
on
account
of
the
intervening
gorge
the
path
descended
almost
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
valley
through
which
there
ran
a
little
mountain
stream
with
a
narrow
fringe
of
green
stunted
herbage
on
each
side
instinct
had
led
the
horses
to
this
desirable
spot
where
having
quenched
their
thirst
they
stood
contented
cropping
the
few
mouthfuls
of
short
grass
happily
in
this
position
the
kourds
could
not
see
them
jack
lost
not
a
moment
in
leading
their
reluctant
steps
from
the
haunts
of
pleasure
to
the
very
dry
and
very
stony
path
of
duty
joyfully
he
brought
them
back
to
where
shushan
was
and
met
her
joyful
welcome
is
the
pain
bad
now
my
shushan
he
asked
no
she
answered
smiling
it
is
only
little
very
as
you
say
in
english
is
not
that
right
now
you
shall
lift
me
on
my
horse
again
and
we
will
go
in
a
few
minutes
more
they
were
on
their
way
when
they
came
near
the
little
stream
they
halted
for
a
while
that
jack
might
bring
water
for
shushan
to
drink
and
bathe
her
ankle
with
it
she
was
very
weary
and
suffering
considerable
pain
but
she
kept
on
bravely
making
no
complaint
it
would
be
very
ungrateful
she
thought
when
god
has
been
so
good
to
us
shushan
said
jack
as
they
rode
along
do
you
know
what
they
call
this
gorge
we
are
coming
out
of
they
call
it
gorge
from
the
robberies
and
murders
there
have
been
in
it
kevork
told
me
when
we
rode
back
together
but
i
did
not
want
to
tell
you
until
we
had
passed
it
yesterday
the
kourds
told
me
the
same
said
shushan
but
did
not
want
to
tell
at
length
the
mountain
gorges
were
left
behind
and
a
roman
road
was
reached
leading
to
the
plain
which
now
began
to
assume
an
appearance
of
cultivation
there
were
wheatfields
and
many
fine
vineyards
laden
with
grapes
but
if
the
prospect
was
pleasing
the
road
was
vile
the
great
cobble
stones
the
romans
loved
had
fallen
apart
and
the
mud
and
gravel
between
them
had
caked
into
a
hard
cement
not
the
of
steeds
could
avoid
constant
slips
and
stumbles
which
filled
up
the
measure
of
poor
shushan
suffering
she
could
scarcely
hold
herself
upon
her
horse
a
little
comfort
came
when
the
sun
shot
up
in
splendour
about
the
same
time
they
got
upon
a
smoother
piece
of
road
and
presently
jack
said
my
shushan
art
thou
too
weary
to
look
up
and
see
old
edessa
in
the
morning
light
shushan
looked
up
it
is
a
sight
to
take
weariness
away
she
said
faintly
but
joyfully
before
them
rose
a
hill
crowned
with
a
magnificent
ruined
castle
and
the
slopes
beneath
it
covered
with
buildings
interspersed
with
fair
green
patches
telling
of
shady
trees
and
pleasant
gardens
but
still
the
eye
turned
back
to
the
noble
ruin
with
its
two
very
tall
pillars
the
use
whereof
no
man
knows
rising
upwards
towards
the
sky
fragments
of
a
great
wall
remained
enclosing
not
the
castle
alone
but
all
the
hill
on
which
the
large
town
is
built
with
its
dense
mass
of
flat
roofs
varied
by
minarets
and
mosques
everywhere
white
was
the
prevailing
colour
so
that
in
the
fair
morning
light
the
old
city
of
king
agbar
seemed
to
have
donned
a
mantle
of
spotless
snow
a
very
high
very
long
roof
of
white
attracted
the
eye
it
belonged
to
the
great
gregorian
cathedral
a
noble
structure
of
enormous
size
capable
it
is
said
of
holding
eight
thousand
persons
jack
turned
to
point
it
out
to
shushan
but
a
glance
at
her
face
made
him
say
instead
my
shushan
you
are
ready
to
faint
you
shall
rest
a
little
here
i
will
lift
you
from
your
horse
no
shack
no
we
are
just
at
home
now
i
will
keep
up
till
i
see
miss
celandine
face
through
the
city
gate
they
rode
unchallenged
and
unhindered
then
they
passed
a
little
market
place
rode
on
through
narrow
streets
and
round
the
protestant
church
and
churchyard
till
they
reached
the
gates
of
the
mission
premises
eyes
that
loved
must
have
been
looking
from
the
window
above
the
front
door
for
jack
had
scarcely
time
to
knock
with
a
trembling
hand
and
to
lift
shushan
from
the
saddle
when
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
spare
figure
stood
within
the
face
was
the
face
of
one
who
had
thought
much
done
much
suffered
much
and
above
all
loved
much
jack
gave
shushan
into
the
motherly
arms
that
opened
wide
to
receive
her
she
laid
her
weary
head
upon
that
strong
kind
shoulder
and
fainted
entirely
away
do
not
be
afraid
for
her
grayson
miss
celandine
said
peace
and
safety
are
good
physicians
footnote

the
appendix
chapter
xiii
what
pastor
stepanian
thought
but
he
was
holy
calm
and
high
as
one
who
saw
an
ecstasy
beyond
a
foreknown
agony
john
grayson
left
his
young
bride
for
the
present
in
the
care
of
miss
celandine
she
is
safe
she
is
absolutely
safe
he
kept
saying
to
himself
that
one
thought
swallowing
up
all
the
rest
he
went
constantly
to
see
her
and
was
relieved
to
find
that
she
very
soon
recovered
from
the
effects
of
her
sprain
which
indeed
was
not
serious
meanwhile
he
stayed
with
the
vartonians
and
watched
anxiously
for
the
coming
of
the
meneshians
to
urfa
until
he
saw
them
settled
there
and
in
some
measure
safe
he
did
not
think
he
ought
to
apply
for
a
passport
for
himself
and
shushan
or
as
she
would
then
be
called
lily
grayson
it
was
october
now
the
gloom
of
a
great
terror
seemed
gathering
over
the
town
so
accustomed
had
jack
grown
to
fears
and
apprehensions
that
he
did
not
notice
it
as
anything
unusual
but
he
could
not
fail
to
notice
a
most
astonishing
and
unexpected
outburst
of
rejoicing
and
festivity
that
came
suddenly
in
the
very
midst
of
the
gloom
as
sometimes
in
a
day
of
storm
when
the
great
thunderclouds
sweep
across
the
sky
the
sun
looks
out
for
a
moment
flashing
a
shaft
of
light
through
the
darkness
so
here
when
all
seemed
blackest
a
sudden
rumour
passed
from
heart
to
heart
from
lip
to
lip
sultan
has
granted
the
not
only
did
the
armenians
of
urfa
whisper
it
within
closed
doors
as
they
were
wont
to
do
with
anything
bearing
however
remotely
upon
politics
men
said
it
aloud
to
each
other
in
the
streets
and
in
the
shops
and
women
talked
of
it
as
they
baked
their
bread
or
drew
their
water
from
the
fountains
what
did
these
reforms
mean
did
they
mean
men
said
they
did
no
more
plundering
kourds
no
more
tyrannous
zaptiehs
no
more
dungeons
and
tortures
for
innocent
men
and
best
of
all
no
more
of
that
wordless
nameless
terror
that
made
the
life
of
the
armenian
woman
one
long
misery
if
indeed
they
meant
ought
not
the
whole
community
to
go
mad
with
joy
the
tidings
came
officially
by
telegraph
and
were
read
aloud
in
the
gregorian
cathedral
there
followed
throughout
the
armenian
quarter
tearful
rejoicings
and
many
services
and
meetings
for
prayer
and
thanksgiving
to
almighty
god
one
day
while
these
were
still
going
on
jack
was
walking
in
one
of
the
narrow
streets
when
he
met
a
young
girl
and
a
boy
about
gabriel
age
the
girl
was
wrapped
from
head
to
foot
in
an
and
closely
veiled
but
the
boy
he
knew
well
having
often
seen
him
with
the
vartonians
and
with
gabriel
young
vartan
stepanian
the
pastor
eldest
son
so
he
knew
the
girl
must
be
oriort
elmas
shushan
friend
and
he
saluted
both
very
cordially
in
passing
he
had
not
gone
on
twenty
paces
when
a
cry
from
vartan
brought
him
back
a
tall
powerful
turk
had
come
suddenly
through
a
door
in
the
wall
and
being
close
to
elmas
for
the
street
was
scarcely
two
yards
wide
seized
her
veil
to
pull
it
off
vartan
sprang
upon
him
and
tried
to
drag
him
away
but
was
not
strong
enough
none
of
that
cried
jack
in
good
english
he
had
no
weapon
but
he
clenched
his
hand
and
putting
forth
all
his
strength
dealt
the
turk
a
blow
between
the
eyes
that
sent
him
staggering
against
the
opposite
wall
allah
cried
the
discomfited
follower
of
mahomet
looking
at
him
with
a
dazed
astonished
air
an
armenian
to
strike
a
blow
like
that
surely
shaytan
had
got
into
him
come
come
quickly
vartan
said
hurrying
his
sister
on
for
fear
of
pursuit
more
dajeeks
may
come
he
explained
to
jack
who
mounted
guard
on
the
other
side
of
elmas
let
us
go
to
the
church
it
is
the
nearest
place
where
we
can
be
safe
the
cathedral
no
that
is
a
long
way
off
my
father
church
they
walked
quickly
and
were
soon
there
when
in
urfa
before
jack
had
always
attended
the
cathedral
services
he
had
not
entered
the
beautiful
protestant
church
since
he
saw
the
dead
lying
there
in
her
peaceful
rest
on
the
morning
of
his
first
arrival
vartan
led
him
through
it
then
by
the
little
side
door
into
his
father
study
all
around
the
room
there
were
bookshelves
filled
to
overflowing
and
with
books
in
several
languages
the
pastor
was
seated
in
a
chair
before
a
little
deal
table
reading
he
was
dressed
la
and
when
after
a
few
words
from
vartan
in
armenian
he
rose
and
greeted
his
visitor
in
excellent
english
jack
thought
himself
back
in
his
own
land
again
he
almost
thought
himself
back
again
in
the
study
of
the
good
old
clergyman
who
had
been
the
pastor
and
teacher
of
his
childhood
it
broke
the
illusion
a
little
when
that
stately
gentleman
touched
his
own
forehead
and
stooped
down
to
kiss
the
hand
jack
stretched
out
to
him
instead
of
taking
it
in
a
hearty
grasp
but
this
was
in
especial
thanks
for
the
service
rendered
to
his
children
and
a
few
earnest
words
just
touched
with
eastern
grace
were
added
the
pastor
said
a
word
or
two
to
elmas
and
vartan
who
left
the
room
then
he
invited
jack
to
take
the
one
chair
and
seated
himself
on
the
little
divan
under
the
window
delighted
at
hearing
his
native
tongue
so
perfectly
spoken
jack
said
impulsively
and
in
english
pastor
you
are
more
than
half
an
englishman
pastor
stepanian
shook
his
head
rather
sadly
but
did
not
speak
then
jack
remembered
the
nationality
of
the
missionaries
his
friends
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
meant
you
are
more
than
half
an
american
neither
english
nor
american
said
hagop
stepanian
proudly
every
drop
of
my
blood
every
pulse
in
my
heart
belongs
to
my
own
race
but
i
am
very
grateful
to
the
americans
our
benefactors
the
blood
rushed
to
the
face
of
john
grayson
i
am
afraid
he
said
you
have
no
cause
to
be
grateful
to
the
pastor
waved
his
hand
i
say
nothing
against
the
english
he
pardon
me
a
moment
he
rose
looked
carefully
round
and
opened
both
doors
of
the
study
ascertaining
in
this
way
that
there
was
no
one
within
earshot
either
in
the
churchyard
or
the
church
then
he
closed
the
doors
again
sat
down
lowered
his
voice
and
began
have
you
been
long
enough
in
this
country
grayson
to
have
seen
a
dead
horse
with
half
a
dozen
hungry
dogs
snarling
round
it
each
wants
a
bit
yet
each
is
so
jealous
of
all
the
rest
that
if
one
dares
touch
it
the
others
fall
on
him
and
drive
him
off
can
you
read
my
parable
yes
the
nations
england
and
the
others
stand
thus
around
turkey
would
it
dead
pastor
take
care
my
young
friend
lest
some
such
word
escape
you
as
you
walk
by
the
way
or
ride
among
the
vineyards
or
sit
with
a
friend
over
your
coffee
in
his
private
room
where
the
very
hangings
may
conceal
a
spy
oh
i
am
cautious
enough
i
have
been
here
nearly
five
years
were
you
here
fifty
you
might
still
have
failed
to
learn
your
lesson
a
word
a
whisper
a
scrap
of
paper
found
upon
you
nay
the
assertion
of
some
one
else
that
you
have
given
him
a
scrap
of
paper
may
consign
you
any
moment
to
a
horrible
dungeon
where
you
will
be
tortured
into
saying
anything
your
accusers
wish
nor
is
that
the
worst
men
have
been
flung
into
prison
and
tortured
almost
to
death
without
being
able
to
guess
the
crime
laid
to
their
charge
i
knew
of
one
who
was
used
in
this
way
and
at
last
they
found
they
had
mistaken
him
for
another
of
the
same
name
he
was
brought
half
dead
before
the
kadi
who
said
to
him
coolly
son
regard
it
not
it
was
an
error
go
in
peace
the
stupidity
of
these
people
would
be
ridiculous
if
the
horror
were
not
too
great
jack
said
nay
grayson
it
is
not
stupidity
it
is
savagery
and
savagery
dominating
civilization
but
that
savagery
is
armed
with
an
ingenuity
almost
devilish
for
the
bringing
about
of
the
designs
in
view
all
outrages
upon
the
christians
are
cleverly
timed
for
some
moment
when
the
eyes
of
christian
europe
are
turned
elsewhere
our
people
are
first
entrapped
made
to
give
up
their
arms
if
they
have
any
cajoled
with
false
promises
of
safety
if
possible
induced
or
forced
to
accuse
each
other
or
themselves
of
seditious
plans
they
never
even
thought
of
then
pastor
are
all
the
rumours
of
plots
and
seditions
here
and
there
mere
fabrications
there
are
plots
no
doubt
armenia
bands
of
desperate
exiles
in
the
great
cities
of
europe
have
committees
hold
meetings
make
revolutionary
plans
and
i
do
not
say
their
emissaries
may
not
find
a
foothold
and
gain
a
hearing
in
some
of
our
towns
those
near
the
russian
frontier
for
instance
but
know
of
none
such
and
i
do
know
what
happened
here
a
short
time
ago
a
young
man
with
an
air
of
importance
and
dressed
la
appeared
one
day
in
the
cathedral
the
bishop
noticed
him
sent
for
him
and
asked
his
business
in
the
town
he
said
he
had
come
to
ask
help
for
the
zeitounlis
and
to
establish
communications
between
them
and
the
urfans
the
bishop
answered
him
two
hours
you
will
be
either
outside
the
city
gate
or
in
the
you
have
your
choice
it
is
not
that
i
do
not
desire
the
deliverance
and
the
freedom
of
my
people
but
they
will
never
gain
it
in
this
way
this
is
only
pulling
down
our
house
upon
our
own
heads
so
much
and
no
more
sedition
and
disloyalty
has
there
been
in
this
city
mr
grayson
but
do
you
not
think
the
worst
for
your
country
is
over
now
these
reforms
the
pastor
shook
his
head
only
another
snare
he
said
at
least
i
forbode
it
the
sultan
gives
us
reforms
on
paper
to
lull
us
into
security
and
to
deceive
our
european
friends
while
he
sharpens
the
dagger
for
our
throats
you
think
then
that
the
reforms
are
worth
the
paper
they
are
written
on
if
the
sultan
meant
them
even
which
he
does
not
who
are
to
carry
them
out
the
pashas
valis
kamaikans
they
are
our
deadliest
enemies
they
want
our
lands
our
houses
our
gold
they
want
the
dreadful
word
be
said
our
wives
and
our
daughters
and
the
zaptiehs
the
redifs
the
hamidiehs
the
kourds
and
the
turkish
rabble
of
every
town
want
to
share
the
spoil
do
they
not
think
too
that
in
killing
us
they
do
god
service
jack
said
us
quite
naturally
now
in
literal
truth
have
you
never
heard
the
prayer
they
recite
daily
in
their
mosques
seek
refuge
with
allah
from
shaytan
the
accuser
in
the
name
of
allah
the
compassionate
the
merciful
o
lord
of
all
creatures
o
allah
destroy
the
infidels
and
polytheists
thine
enemies
the
enemies
of
the
religion
o
allah
make
their
children
orphans
and
defile
their
abodes
cause
their
feet
to
slip
give
them
and
their
families
their
households
and
their
women
their
children
and
their
relations
by
marriage
their
brothers
and
their
friends
their
possessions
and
their
race
their
wealth
and
their
lands
as
booty
to
the
moslems
o
lord
of
all
creatures
rather
a
contrast
this
to
father
which
art
in
heaven
is
it
possible
they
think
god
will
answer
such
a
prayer
said
jack
they
think
it
you
must
remember
their
god
is
not
the
god
and
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
nor
the
father
of
mankind
he
represents
will
and
power
apart
from
love
and
righteousness
will
of
allah
means
everything
to
them
but
it
is
not
necessarily
a
holy
or
a
loving
will
still
people
are
often
better
than
their
creed
you
know
they
are
moreover
the
moslems
creed
has
in
it
some
grand
elements
of
truth
they
acknowledge
one
god
and
they
believe
in
the
duty
and
the
efficacy
of
prayer
oh
yes
and
there
are
some
good
and
generous
turks
who
are
as
kind
to
us
as
they
dare
to
be
i
have
known
such
there
was
one
a
pasha
who
tried
to
rule
according
to
the
avowed
intentions
of
the
sultan
according
to
his
secret
instructions
he
was
deprived
of
his
office
and
banished
to
a
distant
part
of
the
empire
there
a
friend
of
mine
a
missionary
visited
him
not
long
ago
at
first
my
friend
was
disappointed
for
though
the
turk
received
him
with
all
cordiality
he
could
not
be
got
to
talk
but
when
he
returned
the
missionary
visit
and
in
his
lodgings
felt
tolerably
safe
he
told
him
that
every
step
he
took
was
dogged
every
word
he
said
reported
by
the
sultan
spies
even
in
his
most
private
chamber
he
never
knew
what
safety
meant
a
spy
might
lurk
behind
the
tapestry
or
outside
the
door
count
my
life
he
said
days
and
hours
soon
or
late
i
am
sure
to
be
murdered
if
he
is
i
think
he
who
said
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
the
least
of
these
will
have
something
to
say
to
him
surely
in
this
land
jack
observed
that
departeth
from
evil
maketh
himself
a
prey
but
what
do
you
think
of
the
outlook
here
just
now
pastor
do
you
want
to
hear
the
truth
mr
grayson
certainly
then
i
think
in
the
words
of
your
own
poet
it
is
dark
dark
unutterably
dark
and
the
darkness
is
over
all
the
land
darker
than
it
has
been
yet
is
that
possible
jack
queried
yes
what
was
meant
before
was
oppression
what
is
meant
now
is
i
fear
but
said
jack
raising
his
head
suddenly
while
a
new
light
shone
in
his
eyes
there
is
god
to
be
reckoned
with
does
mean
it
way
is
in
the
sea
his
path
is
in
the
great
waters
and
his
footsteps
are
not
known
did
you
notice
the
name
of
my
boy
whom
you
helped
so
kindly
just
now
vartan
in
english
it
is
a
name
dear
to
every
armenian
heart
the
name
of
the
hero
saint
of
our
race
and
yet
saint
vartan
died
in
a
lost
battle
he
fought
against
the
persians
who
summoned
the
armenians
to
submit
to
them
and
to
exchange
the
law
of
the
christ
for
the
creed
of
the
the
persians
were
strong
and
many
the
armenians
were
few
and
weak
but
this
was
their
answer
and
vartan
are
not
better
than
those
before
us
who
laid
down
upon
this
testimony
their
goods
and
their
bodies
ask
us
no
more
for
the
covenant
of
our
faith
is
not
with
men
but
in
bonds
indissoluble
with
god
for
whom
there
is
no
separation
or
departure
neither
now
nor
ever
nor
for
ever
nor
for
ever
and
ever
that
is
what
we
said
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
that
is
what
we
say
when
the
darkest
hour
of
the
darkest
night
is
falling
over
our
land
a
pause
followed
broken
by
stepanian
he
died
in
a
lost
battle
the
battle
is
lost
but
the
cause
triumphs
jack
had
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
but
at
these
words
he
looked
up
again
then
you
see
beyond
the
darkness
a
gleam
of
light
he
said
grayson
i
will
tell
you
a
parable
last
spring
my
little
son
armenag
came
with
me
one
day
to
the
vineyard
i
showed
him
two
vines
one
of
them
was
beautiful
covered
with
luxuriant
leaves
and
tendrils
the
other
a
dry
bare
stick
with
branch
and
leaf
and
tendril
cut
away
by
a
ruthless
hand
of
these
two
will
you
have
for
your
own
to
bear
grapes
for
you
i
asked
the
boy
of
course
he
chose
the
beautiful
leafy
vine
but
the
other
day
in
the
ingathering
i
brought
him
there
again
lo
the
vine
that
kept
its
leaves
and
branches
had
only
a
few
poor
stunted
grapes
while
the
tree
that
had
been
stripped
and
cut
down
was
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
its
great
clusters
of
glorious
fruit
and
said
jack
his
eyes
eagerly
fixed
upon
the
pastor
who
went
on
i
see
some
clusters
ripening
even
now
is
it
nothing
think
you
that
men
and
women
and
children
even
have
been
witnessing
fearlessly
unto
death
for
the
lord
they
love
in
very
truth
like
the
witnesses
of
old
they
have
been
tortured
not
accepting
deliverance
many
have
already
joined
the
noble
army
of
martyrs
and
many
more
are
coming
ay
even
from
this
place
never
of
late
have
i
stood
up
to
preach
and
looked
down
on
the
faces
beneath
me
without
the
thought
that
these
my
people
may
soon
be
standing
in
the
presence
of
christ
and
i
too
i
shall
see
him
soon
are
you
a
prophet
john
grayson
asked
looking
with
amazement
at
the
calm
refined
intellectual
face
of
this
gentleman
of
the
nineteenth
century
who
spoke
of
his
own
martyrdom
as
certainly
as
quietly
and
as
fearlessly
as
if
he
had
said
i
am
going
to
france
or
to
england
i
am
no
prophet
grayson
but
i
think
i
can
read
the
signs
of
the
times
and
though
it
becomes
no
man
to
answer
for
himself
there
are
things
in
which
we
may
trust
god
to
answer
for
us
and
things
which
he
does
not
ask
of
us
he
does
not
ask
the
shepherd
to
save
himself
when
the
sheep
are
smitten
but
death
is
not
the
thing
that
happens
here
jack
said
very
low
nor
even
torture
would
to
god
it
were
do
you
think
i
know
that
said
the
pastor
hoarsely
as
a
shade
of
anguish
crossed
his
face
do
you
think
i
thank
god
every
hour
for
my
dead
my
dead
who
died
by
hand
jack
remembered
what
he
had
seen
in
the
church
that
day
and
held
his
peace
a
great
silence
fell
upon
them
then
hagop
stepanian
stretched
out
his
hand
to
jack
and
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
john
grayson
he
said
do
you
trust
god
jack
frank
blue
eyes
fell
beneath
the
gaze
of
those
dark
searching
eyes
that
seemed
to
have
looked
down
into
unfathomed
depths
of
anguish
and
come
back
from
them
into
peace
i
trust
in
god
he
said
very
low
i
am
sure
of
it
but
here
where
we
stand
now
we
want
more
to
overcome
in
this
warfare
a
man
must
have
laid
wholly
and
without
reserve
his
own
soul
and
body
and
the
souls
and
bodies
that
are
dearer
than
his
own
in
the
hands
of
his
faithful
creator
and
redeemer
do
you
mean
we
must
be
willing
not
only
to
suffer
but
to
see
them
suffer
jack
asked
in
a
broken
voice
that
against
nature
impossible
therefore
god
does
not
ask
it
of
us
all
he
asks
is
that
we
should
be
willing
for
his
will
his
will
oh
his
will
jack
said
almost
with
a
cry
the
will
of
wicked
men
of
devils
even
so
but
he
is
stronger
than
they
and
will
prevail
grayson
will
you
take
my
counsel
except
it
be
to
leave
this
place
and
save
myself
which
at
present
i
can
not
do
i
know
it
you
have
others
you
have
to
think
of
no
you
share
our
peril
and
unless
you
share
also
our
strong
consolation
you
will
be
as
those
that
go
down
into
the
pit
and
your
heart
will
die
within
you
remember
you
must
trust
god
and
trust
him
utterly
in
all
the
generations
he
has
never
yet
broken
faith
with
one
man
who
trusted
him
so
he
will
bring
you
up
out
of
the
depths
again
and
you
shall
behold
his
righteousness
and
one
day
you
shall
see
his
face
with
joy
and
know
wherefore
he
let
these
things
come
upon
us
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
vartan
and
a
younger
boy
bringing
coffee
and
sweetmeats
the
pastor
drew
the
little
one
towards
him
saying
in
armenian
tell
the
english
effendi
armenag
what
our
fathers
in
vartan
day
said
to
the
persians
when
they
bade
them
deny
the
lord
jesus
the
child
answered
steadily
and
as
if
he
meant
every
word
ask
us
no
more
for
the
covenant
of
our
faith
is
not
with
man
but
with
god
for
whom
there
is
no
separation
or
departure
neither
now
nor
ever
nor
for
ever
nor
for
ever
and
ever
and
what
has
god
said
to
them
and
to
us
the
boy
young
voice
rang
clear
and
high
as
he
repeated
his
lesson
mountains
shall
depart
and
the
hills
be
removed
but
my
kindness
shall
not
depart
from
thee
neither
shall
the
covenant
of
my
peace
be
removed
saith
the
lord
that
hath
mercy
on
thee
o
thou
afflicted
tossed
with
tempest
and
not
comforted
behold
i
will
lay
thy
stones
with
fair
colours
and
lay
thy
foundations
with
sapphires
and
i
will
make
thy
windows
of
agates
and
thy
gates
of
carbuncles
and
all
thy
borders
of
pleasant
stones
i
teach
my
children
words
like
these
the
pastor
said
reverting
to
english
that
they
may
know
we
are
watchers
for
the
morning
which
assuredly
our
eyes
shall
see
here
or
elsewhere
he
added
with
a
bright
glance
upwards
jack
sat
in
silence
for
a
space
then
rising
to
take
his
leave
he
grasped
and
wrung
the
pastor
hand
in
true
english
fashion
i
will
remember
what
you
said
about
trusting
god
he
murmured
god
who
is
not
only
above
you
in
heaven
but
underneath
you
in
the
depths
the
pastor
said
there
is
no
abyss
you
can
sink
into
where
you
can
not
sink
down
on
him
and
yet
he
added
with
a
smile
i
have
good
hopes
of
your
safe
return
at
last
to
your
native
land
along
with
your
sweet
bride
shushan
the
daughter
of
our
people
for
you
are
an
englishman
and
such
are
always
protected
here
and
when
god
gives
you
deliverance
think
then
of
this
church
of
his
which
is
afflicted
tossed
with
tempests
and
not
comforted
may
yours
be
the
hand
he
uses
to
comfort
her
then
once
more
in
armenian
vartan
do
you
go
with
grayson
to
his
home
you
can
take
him
by
the
shortest
way
yes
father
but
i
want
to
tell
you
the
boy
lowered
his
voice
osman
has
just
been
here
to
let
us
know
privately
we
should
not
try
to
hold
a
meeting
for
thanksgiving
the
zaptiehs
will
disperse
it
by
force
i
will
see
what
ought
to
be
so
much
for
the
reforms
grayson
but
do
not
speak
of
this
osman
is
a
young
turk
who
bears
us
good
will
as
i
have
told
you
some
do
and
an
incautious
word
might
bring
him
into
trouble
once
more
farewell
god
bless
you
chapter
xiv
a
modern
thermopylæ
in
yon
strait
path
a
thousand
may
well
be
stopped
by
three
now
who
will
stand
on
either
hand
and
keep
the
way
with
me
jack
often
went
after
this
to
the
protestant
church
to
hear
pastor
stepanian
preach
he
had
been
much
impressed
by
his
words
and
still
more
by
his
remarkable
personality
and
there
was
the
added
pleasure
of
worshipping
with
shushan
who
sat
demurely
by
miss
celandine
on
the
women
side
of
the
church
oriort
elmas
was
there
too
a
girl
a
good
deal
taller
than
shushan
and
far
less
regularly
beautiful
but
with
a
face
full
of
intelligence
he
heard
much
of
her
courage
and
charity
in
ministering
to
the
poor
and
sick
as
well
as
of
her
loving
care
of
her
young
brothers
and
sister
he
met
her
once
or
twice
at
the
vartonians
with
whom
she
was
very
intimate
and
he
thought
kevork
a
fortunate
man
with
the
mental
reservation
that
he
was
much
more
fortunate
himself
a
reflection
which
makes
it
easy
to
rejoice
with
them
that
do
rejoice
jack
heard
from
shushan
when
he
visited
her
many
lamentations
over
the
departure
of
her
beloved
young
teacher
miss
fairchild
many
stories
lingered
in
urfa
and
were
told
him
by
the
vartonians
of
those
loving
ministrations
to
the
poor
and
especially
to
the
sassoun
refugees
which
had
nearly
cost
the
young
missionary
her
life
and
also
of
the
gratitude
and
affection
with
which
they
were
repaid
once
during
her
illness
when
her
life
was
almost
despaired
of
a
poor
man
a
seller
of
antiquities
heard
that
she
had
asked
for
fish
this
seemed
impossible
to
procure
for
it
was
summer
and
the
euphrates
from
which
fish
was
brought
in
winter
was
two
days
journey
off
but
in
the
midst
of
the
city
is
the
beautiful
pool
of
abraham
where
are
kept
the
sacred
fish
which
every
one
feeds
and
which
the
moslems
esteem
so
highly
it
is
death
to
touch
one
of
them
the
poor
armenian
watched
by
the
pool
until
the
darkest
and
most
silent
hour
of
the
night
then
at
the
peril
of
his
life
he
caught
some
of
the
fish
and
brought
them
to
the
mission
house
david
three
mighty
men
who
brought
the
water
from
the
well
of
bethlehem
did
no
more
very
touching
also
was
the
story
of
the
service
held
in
the
cathedral
to
pray
for
her
recovery
the
gregorian
bishop
and
all
the
priests
in
the
city
took
part
in
it
and
the
great
building
was
thronged
from
end
to
end
god
give
her
back
to
us
the
armenians
said
on
sunday
the
of
october
jack
attended
pastor
stepanian
church
after
the
service
he
went
to
meet
his
friends
who
had
most
of
them
gone
to
the
cathedral
he
saw
before
he
reached
it
that
something
unusual
was
going
on
all
the
armenians
he
met
seemed
to
be
in
a
curious
state
of
excitement
most
of
them
were
hurrying
somewhere
in
hot
haste
whatever
possessed
them
this
time
however
it
was
certainly
not
fear
the
scraps
of
conversation
that
reached
his
ear
savoured
of
hope
and
of
confident
appeal
to
law
have
him
up
go
to
government
house
see
what
they
will
do
and
words
like
these
oh
gabriel
is
that
you
he
cried
seeing
the
boy
come
towards
him
you
will
tell
me
what
is
all
this
about
gabriel
who
had
been
at
the
cathedral
explained
there
was
a
crowd
of
us
standing
about
in
the
churchyard
after
service
when
a
turk
came
in
he
looked
from
one
to
another
no
one
caring
to
say
anything
to
him
though
of
course
he
had
no
business
there
till
at
last
he
lighted
upon
poor
baghas
the
he
began
to
curse
him
by
the
prophet
and
to
give
him
all
sorts
of
foul
language
how
had
he
a
dog
of
a
giaour
dared
to
come
to
house
and
ask
him
for
money
baghas
stood
his
ground
with
a
courage
that
astonished
us
all
he
told
the
turk
plainly
it
was
all
his
own
fault
what
business
had
he
to
buy
gold
coins
of
him
if
he
could
not
pay
for
them
let
him
give
him
the
money
he
owed
him
and
make
an
end
that
was
all
he
wanted
there
came
to
be
a
crowd
round
the
two
of
them
yet
was
no
man
quick
enough
to
stop
the
turk
when
he
flashed
out
his
scimitar
and
stabbed
poor
baghas
to
the
heart
that
for
payment
giaour
saith
he
but
he
said
no
more
for
our
people
closed
upon
him
with
a
cry
of
rage
i
heard
them
saying
we
shall
see
the
good
of
the
reforms
we
shall
have
justice
are
our
men
to
be
killed
like
dogs
and
more
of
that
kind
heaven
send
they
have
not
harmed
the
turk
jack
said
the
bill
for
that
would
be
too
heavy
i
do
think
they
have
they
got
him
in
the
midst
of
them
and
they
are
taking
him
to
the
government
house
to
lodge
a
complaint
against
him
there
i
remember
once
in
england
seeing
a
sparrow
fly
at
a
cat
in
defence
of
her
young
it
reminds
me
of
that
said
jack
gabriel
i
want
to
see
this
thing
through
but
i
do
want
to
come
there
may
be
rough
work
oh
i
should
to
come
i
am
not
afraid
but
if
you
were
hurt
shushan
would
not
like
that
we
must
think
of
her
yes
said
gabriel
slowly
yon
effendi
i
will
go
home
with
a
jack
scarcely
appreciated
at
its
full
value
he
turned
away
and
ran
quickly
down
a
side
street
jack
went
on
his
way
and
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
it
for
cries
and
shouts
and
the
trampling
of
many
feet
directed
him
to
a
market
place
some
distance
off
here
at
first
he
could
not
see
the
wood
for
the
trees
all
the
place
seemed
full
of
turks
and
armenians
mixed
together
shouting
struggling
swaying
and
pushing
now
this
way
now
that
it
seemed
to
be
a
free
fight
but
what
they
were
all
fighting
about
was
not
clear
to
an
onlooker
still
not
to
be
left
out
when
good
things
were
going
jack
took
his
share
by
snatching
a
knife
from
the
hand
of
a
turk
who
was
threatening
an
armenian
with
it
presently
half
a
dozen
turkish
horse
regulars
with
a
officer
at
their
head
came
dashing
into
the
square
and
sending
both
turks
and
christians
running
in
all
directions
but
one
turk
did
not
run
for
he
lay
dying
on
the
ground
it
was
the
murderer
of
baghas
the
soldiers
took
up
the
wounded
man
and
set
him
on
a
horse
and
then
the
turks
began
to
return
a
number
of
them
gathered
round
the
group
with
a
few
christians
also
jack
heard
them
cry
out
that
the
man
was
dying
how
did
you
get
here
yon
effendi
said
the
voice
of
barkev
vartonian
beside
him
i
met
gabriel
and
came
what
are
they
going
to
do
going
to
take
the
man
to
the
government
house
i
suppose
they
will
never
get
him
there
alive
barkev
who
killed
him
the
zaptiehs
of
course
when
they
could
not
get
him
from
us
i
one
of
them
stab
him
with
a
bayonet
i
thought
one
of
our
people
might
have
done
it
seeing
they
wanted
to
take
him
from
us
how
save
with
sticks
or
stones
we
have
nothing
else
as
you
know
but
the
turks
will
try
to
put
it
on
us
no
doubt
come
along
to
the
government
house
and
let
us
see
what
happens
as
they
reached
the
place
barkev
exclaimed
djanum
there
is
melkon
of
all
men
in
the
hands
of
the
zaptiehs
what
can
have
done
not
arrested
as
a
criminal
i
hope
but
called
in
as
a
doctor
said
jack
as
they
came
up
if
so
the
wounded
turk
was
beyond
his
skill
they
heard
those
around
him
saying
he
was
dead
at
the
same
time
melkon
voice
reached
their
ears
he
could
do
no
good
now
he
pleaded
entreating
the
turks
to
let
him
go
about
his
business
which
was
urgent
he
had
a
serious
case
to
attend
to
a
mussulman
effendi
no
he
must
stay
and
certify
to
the
cause
of
death
barkev
and
jack
followed
the
crowd
which
streamed
into
the
government
house
an
open
court
where
they
could
see
all
that
passed
they
saw
the
body
laid
on
a
divan
and
they
saw
melkon
approach
to
examine
it
the
turkish
officer
stood
beside
him
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
this
man
has
been
killed
by
the
blows
of
sticks
or
bludgeons
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
melkon
stooped
over
the
body
the
officer
stooped
also
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
almost
instantly
melkon
stood
up
his
face
pale
as
that
of
the
dead
man
who
lay
before
them
for
once
the
noisy
chattering
eastern
crowd
kept
a
profound
silence
melkon
low
firm
voice
reached
every
ear
this
man
has
died
of
wounds
inflicted
by
the
bayonet
no
case
against
us
barkev
said
but
melkon
had
sealed
his
own
death
warrant
and
he
knew
it
for
one
moment
he
faced
the
crowd
i
can
die
but
i
can
not
lie
he
said
his
voice
was
drowned
in
a
howl
of
execration
and
a
dozen
furious
hands
laid
hold
on
him
at
once
to
the
rescue
cried
jack
and
barkev
together
dashing
in
amongst
the
throng
keep
quiet
muttered
a
voice
beside
them
and
a
turk
they
knew
laid
his
hand
on
barkev
shoulder
keep
quiet
and
go
home
he
went
on
in
a
whisper
my
brothers
have
got
the
doctor
and
will
hide
him
in
our
house
he
has
attended
us
we
like
him
and
we
will
not
let
him
be
killed
somewhat
comforted
the
young
men
went
home
as
they
passed
through
the
streets
the
moslems
greeted
them
with
threats
and
insults
we
will
soon
make
an
end
of
you
dogs
of
giaours
they
cried
boys
threw
stones
at
them
and
women
screamed
curses
foul
and
hideous
turkish
curses
at
the
top
of
their
shrill
voices
i
do
not
like
the
look
of
things
at
all
said
barkev
when
they
got
into
their
own
quarter
nor
i
jack
answered
i
think
it
would
be
no
harm
for
some
of
us
to
keep
watch
i
volunteer
for
one
and
he
went
apart
to
clean
his
precious
revolver
and
to
load
the
two
serviceable
barrels
he
had
not
dared
to
get
it
set
in
order
that
would
have
been
far
too
dangerous
the
night
so
far
as
they
knew
passed
quietly
away
many
armenians
had
shops
or
booths
or
other
business
to
attend
to
outside
their
own
quarter
and
this
was
the
case
with
some
members
of
the
vartonian
family
on
monday
morning
the
women
prayed
of
them
to
stay
at
home
and
indeed
the
greater
number
did
so
but
others
thought
it
the
part
of
wisdom
as
well
as
of
manly
courage
to
go
about
as
usual
barkev
vartonian
was
amongst
these
and
jack
went
with
him
for
company
they
had
not
gone
far
beyond
the
limits
of
their
own
quarter
when
a
boy
ran
against
them
screaming
with
terror
and
caught
jack
by
the
zeboun
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
poor
child
he
asked
then
looking
more
closely
cried
out
hagop
hagop
meneshian
how
is
this
have
you
all
come
where
are
you
we
came
in
at
the
gate
hagop
gasped
out
then
the
dajeeks
set
on
us
with
sticks
and
stones
and
knives
oh
they
are
going
to
kill
us
what
shall
we
do
do
be
afraid
we
will
protect
you
where
are
the
rest
down
there
in
the
market
place
the
corner
by
the
dead
wall
kevork
and
the
others
are
defending
the
women
and
children
as
well
as
they
can
i
slipped
through
somehow
and
ran
on
to
tell
you
do
come
back
with
us
run
along
that
narrow
street
keep
to
the
right
and
once
in
our
quarter
you
will
be
safe
ask
any
one
for
baron
vartonian
house
you
can
send
us
any
men
you
find
to
help
barkev
and
jack
hurried
on
to
the
rescue
of
their
friends
they
were
met
on
their
way
by
a
hideous
rabble
of
turkish
men
and
boys
the
very
scum
of
the
city
who
were
dragging
along
at
the
end
of
a
rope
with
shouts
and
ribald
laughter
was
that
a
human
form
so
horribly
torn
and
mutilated
was
that
a
human
face
was
it
the
face
they
saw
not
four
and
twenty
hours
ago
white
and
set
yet
calm
in
its
brave
resolve
it
is
melkon
jack
whispered
in
horror
they
have
killed
him
oh
god
what
things
are
done
here
come
on
come
on
do
look
said
barkev
we
have
my
cousins
to
save
from
a
like
fate
they
found
the
meneshians
in
a
corner
of
the
market
place
still
keeping
the
foe
at
bay
they
had
the
advantage
of
being
most
of
them
on
horses
or
on
mules
but
the
density
of
the
hostile
crowd
and
the
number
of
women
and
children
they
had
with
them
had
kept
them
from
breaking
through
while
they
made
all
the
better
mark
for
stones
and
mud
however
their
tormentors
were
getting
tired
of
a
kind
of
sport
which
yielded
no
profit
rather
a
pity
when
their
brethren
were
looting
the
armenian
shops
in
the
bazaar
so
the
crowd
soon
gave
way
sufficiently
to
enable
jack
and
barkev
to
extricate
their
friends
and
they
led
the
terrified
party
towards
the
armenian
quarter
some
were
bleeding
from
the
stones
that
had
been
thrown
at
them
all
had
their
clothing
torn
and
disfigured
with
mud
the
children
were
crying
and
two
or
three
of
the
women
were
ready
to
faint
meanwhile
there
was
a
roar
behind
them
like
the
roar
of
many
waters
breaking
on
a
shore
the
mob
the
savage
mob
of
an
eastern
city
was
death
to
the
giaours
was
the
cry
that
rose
and
surged
surged
and
rose
again
the
luckless
armenians
who
had
ventured
into
the
turkish
town
were
fleeing
before
the
storm
fleeing
for
their
lives
many
of
them
streaming
with
blood
would
that
mob
pour
on
like
sea
waves
in
a
storm
into
the
narrow
streets
of
the
armenian
quarter
would
they
slay
utterly
young
and
old
men
and
maidens
and
little
children
no
the
weak
should
not
die
if
the
strong
could
protect
them
barkev
kevork
jack
and
other
young
men
sent
the
rest
on
before
them
and
took
their
stand
in
a
narrow
street
at
the
entrance
of
their
quarter
it
bade
fair
to
be
a
little
modern
thermopylæ
surely
neither
greek
nor
roman
ever
fought
in
a
holier
cause
or
for
dearer
issues
nor
against
greater
odds
nor
with
more
determined
courage
gabriel
just
back
from
school
came
with
the
rest
jack
sent
him
for
his
revolver
you
know
where
to
get
it
he
said
the
others
armed
themselves
as
they
could
with
sticks
and
stones
not
another
firearm
was
seen
save
this
revolver
the
turks
had
plenty
of
firearms
with
the
rabble
were
mingled
regular
soldiers
zaptiehs
redifs
hamidiehs
kourds
all
fully
armed
all
thirsting
for
blood
and
plunder
the
armenians
could
scarcely
have
held
their
own
had
they
not
had
good
allies
on
the
flat
roofs
of
their
houses
these
had
all
parapets
of
loose
stones
treasuries
of
effective
weapons
for
the
men
the
women
and
the
boys
who
flung
them
down
on
the
heads
of
the
moslems
jack
two
barrels
were
soon
emptied
as
two
of
the
turks
knew
to
their
cost
but
he
could
not
reload
so
a
friend
behind
him
snatched
the
weapon
out
of
his
hand
and
thrust
into
it
a
stout
bludgeon
with
this
he
played
the
man
his
whole
soul
in
the
blows
he
dealt
he
was
fighting
for
dear
life
for
dearer
lives
than
his
own
was
it
minutes
hours
years
that
he
stood
there
struggling
in
that
desperate
were
the
moslems
giving
ground
at
last
what
did
it
mean
there
certainly
was
a
space
growing
before
the
defenders
they
had
room
now
to
breathe
two
or
three
turks
lay
in
the
street
dead
or
dying
others
were
well
bruised
with
bludgeons
or
cut
with
stones
a
panic
began
among
them
and
presently
for
an
eastern
crowd
does
nothing
by
halves
the
street
was
cleared
with
a
rush
it
was
a
regular
stampede
the
christians
drew
breath
and
looked
one
another
in
the
face
safe
at
last
jack
said
for
the
present
said
kevork
wiping
his
brow
but
the
next
moment
he
cried
in
horror
my
father
he
is
dying
the
christians
of
course
had
suffered
in
the
fray
several
lay
dead
others
were
sorely
wounded
one
of
these
was
boghos
who
though
no
longer
young
had
chosen
to
take
part
in
the
defence
jack
and
kevork
in
great
distress
carried
him
into
a
house
at
hand
the
owner
a
carpenter
named
selferian
cordially
inviting
them
in
and
his
handsome
intelligent
wife
josephine
hanum
by
name
bringing
linen
and
cold
water
while
the
eldest
boy
ran
for
the
nearest
doctor
fortunately
the
wound
when
examined
by
him
did
not
seem
to
be
immediately
dangerous
though
it
was
certainly
serious
when
the
armenians
had
time
to
compare
notes
it
appeared
that
all
the
principal
entrances
to
their
quarter
had
been
defended
with
the
same
desperate
courage
and
with
equal
success
there
was
considerable
loss
of
life
inevitable
when
their
assailants
had
firearms
and
they
had
none
but
at
least
for
the
present
they
were
safe
with
their
wives
and
children
that
is
to
say
they
were
safe
within
the
limits
of
their
own
quarter
outside
of
it
even
at
its
very
entrance
every
armenian
was
mercilessly
slain
at
least
to
be
accurate
the
men
and
the
boys
were
slain
armenian
shops
of
which
there
were
many
including
the
best
and
richest
in
the
town
were
given
over
to
plunder
and
armenian
houses
shared
the
same
fate
still
at
first
in
the
armenian
quarter
the
feeling
was
one
of
relief
when
a
naked
sword
that
has
been
held
at
your
throat
is
suddenly
withdrawn
your
first
sensation
is
delightful
whatever
the
next
may
be
it
took
the
armenians
some
days
at
least
to
realize
two
awful
facts
that
their
friends
and
relatives
outside
were
hopelessly
lost
and
that
they
were
themselves
straitly
shut
up
and
besieged
had
the
meneshian
family
been
twelve
hours
later
in
entering
the
town
not
one
of
them
probably
would
have
been
left
alive
their
journey
from
biridjik
to
urfa
had
been
a
most
perilous
one
as
every
moslem
in
the
country
seemed
to
be
in
arms
against
them
they
could
scarcely
have
accomplished
it
at
all
but
for
an
expedient
of
kevork
jack
had
provided
a
kourdish
dress
for
him
as
well
as
for
himself
and
for
shushan
supposing
that
he
would
return
with
them
to
urfa
he
wore
this
during
the
journey
and
rode
boldly
in
front
of
the
party
whose
guide
and
protector
he
was
supposed
to
be
he
had
changed
it
however
before
entering
the
city
as
he
never
dreamed
of
danger
and
imagined
it
would
expose
him
to
ridicule
great
anxiety
was
felt
about
miss
celandine
and
the
other
inmates
of
the
mission
premises
but
this
as
far
as
jack
was
concerned
was
soon
allayed
though
in
a
way
that
caused
his
friends
a
terrible
alarm
two
zaptiehs
came
to
the
vartonian
house
enquiring
for
one
grayson
effendi
every
one
thought
nothing
less
than
that
he
had
been
identified
in
the
crowd
at
the
gate
as
the
man
who
used
the
revolver
and
that
this
summons
meant
imprisonment
as
bad
or
worse
than
death
great
was
the
relief
when
it
proved
to
mean
only
a
polite
request
to
visit
miss
celandine
true
to
his
system
and
he
does
everything
upon
system
the
turk
would
not
willingly
injure
a
foreign
subject
miss
celandine
therefore
was
not
only
left
unmolested
but
given
a
guard
of
zaptiehs
to
protect
her
premises
from
the
mob
these
zaptiehs
did
their
work
faithfully
and
it
seems
that
some
of
them
at
least
were
won
to
regard
their
charges
with
respect
and
liking
jack
went
to
the
mission
house
as
safe
in
reality
as
if
he
had
been
walking
in
a
london
street
though
under
the
escort
of
men
who
at
a
word
from
their
captain
would
have
torn
him
limb
from
limb
with
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
he
found
the
mission
premises
crowded
with
persons
who
had
taken
refuge
there
during
the
late
disturbances
many
of
them
were
wounded
and
all
were
destitute
the
courtyard
was
filled
with
them
as
well
as
most
of
the
rooms
of
the
house
miss
celandine
who
since
the
departure
of
her
youthful
had
stood
completely
alone
looked
ten
years
older
than
when
he
saw
her
last
thinner
she
could
scarcely
be
but
her
eyes
had
dark
circles
round
them
and
her
face
an
abiding
look
of
horror
she
led
him
into
the
only
private
room
she
had
left
and
made
anxious
enquiries
about
the
state
of
the
armenian
quarter
which
although
it
was
at
her
very
gates
it
was
practically
impossible
for
her
to
enter
then
she
said
grayson
i
am
sending
to
the
pasha
to
ask
for
a
passport
it
is
what
any
one
would
do
in
your
place
what
any
one
else
would
have
done
long
ago
he
answered
this
is
why
i
do
it
the
danger
seems
over
here
the
massacre
is
stopped
yet
i
can
not
resume
my
work
amongst
the
people
that
is
not
permitted
to
me
here
i
am
useless
i
am
only
witnessing
misery
i
can
not
relieve
but
in
england
or
america
i
could
do
a
great
deal
i
could
tell
the
truth
the
very
truth
about
what
is
done
here
if
england
and
america
knew
i
think
it
would
change
everything
i
am
persuaded
better
things
of
my
than
that
they
would
sit
still
and
tolerate
the
destruction
with
every
aggravation
of
refined
diabolical
cruelty
of
a
nation
of
christians
only
because
they
christians
miss
celandine
seldom
spoke
in
this
way
but
her
heart
was
hot
and
sore
within
her
she
had
just
been
hearing
a
recital
of
horrors
such
as
may
not
be
mentioned
here
and
was
in
no
mood
to
guard
her
words
the
hatred
of
turks
for
armenians
is
a
growth
of
centuries
rooted
in
complex
causes
but
the
fact
that
they
are
christians
lifts
the
bridle
from
the
jaws
of
the
oppressor
making
every
act
of
cruelty
to
them
a
merit
their
extermination
a
holy
war
and
since
by
embracing
islam
they
would
come
under
the
protection
of
the
prophet
it
is
because
of
their
firm
adherence
to
their
faith
that
these
unhappy
ones
are
given
over
to
the
sword
you
are
right
to
go
jack
said
simply
and
oh
he
added
his
eyes
kindling
and
his
whole
face
changing
you
will
take
shushan
with
you
that
is
what
you
mean
why
you
sent
for
me
god
bless
you
ten
thousand
times
the
smile
that
lit
up
the
worn
face
made
it
very
sweet
to
look
upon
yes
my
dear
boy
she
said
i
do
mean
that
but
i
dare
not
take
her
with
me
either
as
shushan
meneshian
or
under
the
name
she
has
now
a
right
to
bear
it
would
cause
too
much
remark
and
enquiry
no
she
had
better
pass
as
one
of
my
servants
a
certain
number
of
whom
i
have
the
right
to
take
but
this
is
what
i
sent
for
you
to
ask
will
you
also
apply
for
a
passport
and
come
with
us
jack
was
silent
indeed
he
could
not
speak
for
the
fierce
hope
the
passionate
longing
that
arose
within
him
was
too
strong
for
words
to
leave
all
this
misery
to
stand
with
shushan
on
the
shores
of
england
the
thought
grew
frightful
was
so
wildly
dear
but
soon
reflection
came
it
could
not
be
all
at
once
he
threw
back
his
head
with
a
sharp
sudden
no
very
startling
to
the
lady
whose
nerves
were
already
strung
to
their
utmost
tension
in
the
first
place
everything
would
come
out
i
should
be
known
as
the
englishman
john
grayson
who
married
an
armenian
in
biridjik
and
who
afterwards
killed
kourds
and
fired
on
mussulmans
with
a
revolver
they
would
probably
be
afraid
to
meddle
with
you
they
might
you
know
their
ways
much
better
than
i
do
but
i
suspect
they
would
find
a
way
of
paying
me
back
my
revolver
shots
in
kind
or
worse
before
i
left
the
country
and
even
suppose
i
got
safe
out
and
shushan
too
what
would
be
the
fate
of
the
meneshians
would
not
sevenfold
vengeance
descend
on
them
which
even
if
could
bear
to
think
of
what
of
shushan
there
is
another
thing
though
i
scarce
like
to
say
it
jack
added
in
a
different
tone
and
with
a
kind
of
relapse
into
boyishness
all
the
people
here
the
meneshians
the
vartonians
and
the
rest
in
some
queer
way
i
can
not
explain
seem
to
cling
to
me
they
give
me
far
more
credit
than
i
deserve
for
the
repulse
of
the
turks
the
other
day
and
somehow
they
fancy
i
can
protect
them
i
suppose
it
is
because
i
am
an
englishman
come
of
fathers
and
mothers
who
have
not
been
afraid
because
they
had
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
for
generation
upon
generation
so
i
want
to
stay
at
all
events
till
this
affair
is
over
john
grayson
you
are
a
brave
lad
said
miss
celandine
stretching
out
her
thin
worn
hand
to
him
jack
took
it
with
all
reverence
what
deeds
of
kindness
and
pity
and
heroic
beneficence
that
weak
woman
hand
had
done
like
the
people
he
dwelt
amongst
he
bowed
over
it
touching
it
with
his
lips
and
his
forehead
then
he
said
smiling
but
also
i
am
a
man
now
if
it
please
you
miss
celandine
may
i
see
my
wife
certainly
i
will
go
and
fetch
her
in
a
few
minutes
shushan
entered
she
had
grown
a
little
pale
with
the
anxieties
of
the
last
days
but
he
thought
she
looked
sweeter
than
ever
she
had
much
to
hear
from
him
about
her
family
and
about
her
father
of
whom
he
was
able
to
give
her
a
hopeful
report
an
hour
passed
in
earnest
talk
but
what
each
said
to
the
other
neither
told
afterwards
when
at
last
the
moment
of
parting
came
neither
cared
to
think
how
long
a
parting
it
might
be
lip
met
lip
heart
throbbed
against
heart
shushan
was
the
braver
now
you
know
shack
she
said
the
cross
of
christ
was
laid
on
us
together
nothing
can
keep
us
parted
after
that
the
cross
laid
on
us
together
jack
repeated
indeed
it
looks
like
it
but
do
not
droop
my
lily
with
god
help
we
will
win
through
yet
and
have
a
joyful
ending
to
all
our
troubles
but
something
in
his
own
heart
gave
the
lie
to
his
hopeful
words
as
he
took
one
last
lingering
gaze
and
sadly
turned
to
go
yertaak
paré
said
shushan
softly
menaak
paré
he
responded
and
went
footnote
my
soul
a
common
exclamation
chapter
xv
dark
hours
oh
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
heavens
high
above
yon
stars
and
beyond
yon
sky
where
the
dazzling
fields
need
no
other
light
nor
the
sun
by
day
nor
the
moon
by
night
though
shining
millions
around
thee
stand
for
the
sake
of
him
at
thy
right
hand
think
on
the
souls
he
died
for
here
wandering
in
darkness
sorrow
and
fear
the
powers
of
darkness
are
all
abroad
they
own
no
saviour
they
fear
no
god
and
we
are
trembling
in
dumb
dismay
oh
turn
not
thou
thy
face
away
midnight
if
the
armenians
were
safe
for
the
present
in
their
own
quarter
from
actual
murder
it
was
the
most
that
could
be
said
they
dared
not
stir
an
inch
beyond
its
boundaries
and
within
it
the
redifs
who
were
quartered
upon
them
ostensibly
as
protectors
but
really
as
spies
committed
many
horrible
outrages
they
were
continually
pressed
to
surrender
firearms
which
they
did
not
possess
to
satisfy
the
authorities
any
pieces
that
could
be
found
by
diligent
search
amongst
the
few
who
had
dared
to
conceal
them
were
given
up
and
this
much
to
his
regret
was
the
fate
of
jack
revolver
still
the
turks
persisted
in
the
assertion
that
the
armenians
had
a
large
number
of
martinis
supplied
to
them
by
foreigners
and
that
these
must
be
produced
before
they
could
promise
them
security
for
their
lives
and
their
possessions
vain
were
their
protestations
that
these
martinis
had
no
existence
that
they
had
never
even
heard
of
them
in
the
end
the
persecuted
community
actually
arms
from
the
turks
themselves
which
they
then
gave
back
to
the
government
this
might
appear
at
first
a
mere
trick
of
the
officials
to
secure
a
trifle
of
dishonest
gain
it
was
much
more
it
was
part
of
the
subtle
skilful
elaborate
plan
by
which
a
net
was
drawn
around
the
doomed
race
and
they
were
made
to
appear
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
might
have
befriended
them
as
the
doers
not
the
sufferers
of
violence
in
a
european
newspaper
english
or
german
the
transaction
might
have
read
thus
at
urfa
a
town
on
the
euphrates
a
disturbance
was
caused
by
the
armenians
who
attacked
a
party
of
zaptiehs
as
they
were
conveying
a
prisoner
to
the
they
overpowered
the
zaptiehs
and
killed
the
prisoner
against
whom
they
had
a
grudge
some
rioting
ensued
shops
were
plundered
and
several
persons
both
mussulmans
and
armenians
were
killed
but
the
armenians
having
surrendered
their
and
being
restricted
for
the
present
to
their
own
quarter
order
and
tranquillity
have
now
been
completely
restored
through
the
firmness
of
the
government
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
john
grayson
might
have
been
reading
if
he
had
stayed
in
england
he
would
probably
have
dismissed
the
subject
with
the
careless
comment
people
are
always
fighting
and
killing
each
other
in
those
places
and
turned
with
quickened
interest
to
the
great
cricket
match
on
the
next
page
but
now
he
was
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
agony
which
made
all
the
difference
he
was
shuddering
and
starving
with
the
thousands
packed
together
in
those
close
unhealthy
streets
at
first
a
danger
threatened
them
almost
as
terrible
as
the
sword
of
the
turk
the
water
of
the
fountains
they
used
came
to
them
through
the
great
ancient
aqueduct
and
this
supply
the
turks
could
and
did
cut
off
but
there
were
in
their
quarter
some
old
unused
wells
which
they
cleaned
out
and
made
available
though
the
water
obtained
in
this
way
was
neither
pure
nor
healthful
their
stores
of
rice
bulghour
and
other
kinds
of
food
which
happily
they
had
just
laid
in
for
the
winter
were
husbanded
with
all
possible
care
jack
took
an
active
share
in
everything
that
was
done
his
leisure
time
he
employed
in
learning
turkish
for
he
saw
how
greatly
his
own
and
shushan
dangers
on
their
journey
had
been
increased
by
his
want
of
it
it
was
not
a
difficult
task
many
turkish
words
and
phrases
which
were
in
common
use
he
already
knew
the
turkish
language
moreover
is
very
poor
and
scanty
containing
it
is
said
not
more
than
seven
hundred
really
indigenous
words
he
continued
to
live
with
the
vartonians
and
indeed
the
whole
meneshian
family
contrived
to
stow
itself
away
in
their
large
and
hospitable
house
with
the
exception
of
the
wounded
boghos
now
slowly
recovering
and
his
wife
who
remained
for
the
present
with
the
selferians
it
was
thought
that
thomassian
might
have
received
some
of
the
meneshians
as
they
were
his
kinsmen
also
but
his
mind
at
this
time
seemed
to
be
wholly
absorbed
in
grief
for
the
destruction
of
his
property
his
large
shop
had
been
looted
and
fresh
stores
coming
to
him
from
aleppo
had
been
intercepted
and
seized
unhinged
by
these
catastrophes
and
by
the
apprehension
of
worse
to
come
he
fell
into
a
state
of
morbid
depression
he
used
to
rouse
himself
however
to
take
part
in
the
meetings
for
consultation
which
were
held
with
many
precautions
by
the
armenian
notables
and
he
often
gave
very
good
and
sensible
advice
he
was
not
fond
of
giving
anything
else
is
making
a
hole
in
the
water
to
ask
to
do
anything
for
you
said
the
younger
vartonians
but
he
might
comfort
himself
under
his
losses
with
the
thought
that
the
turks
are
sure
to
poison
themselves
with
some
of
his
drugs
not
knowing
the
use
of
them
communication
with
the
mission
house
had
now
become
very
difficult
though
the
armenians
knew
that
their
friends
were
still
in
safety
there
it
was
no
longer
practicable
to
hold
service
in
the
protestant
church
so
jack
opportunities
of
seeing
shushan
and
kevork
of
seeing
elmas
were
no
more
miss
celandine
however
contrived
occasionally
through
her
zaptiehs
to
send
news
of
shushan
to
jack
and
to
get
tidings
in
return
for
her
of
him
and
of
her
family
in
this
way
she
informed
him
also
that
she
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
obtaining
her
passport
the
pasha
made
fair
promises
but
continually
put
off
the
granting
of
her
request
on
the
plea
of
the
disturbed
condition
of
the
country
the
gregorians
still
assembled
very
constantly
for
the
prayer
they
so
much
needed
in
their
great
cathedral
and
it
was
before
or
after
these
services
that
they
used
to
deliberate
together
on
the
state
of
affairs
in
one
of
these
consultations
they
were
lamenting
as
they
often
did
the
impossibility
of
sending
news
of
their
condition
to
those
outside
who
might
help
them
post
and
telegraph
were
closed
to
them
and
as
they
surmised
to
miss
celandine
also
two
or
three
messengers
with
letters
concealed
about
them
had
gone
forth
secretly
and
at
terrible
risk
but
they
had
never
been
heard
of
again
the
presumption
was
that
they
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
turks
what
more
could
the
armenians
do
then
john
grayson
rose
up
in
his
place
between
kevork
and
avedis
and
these
were
the
words
he
said
friends
i
will
be
your
next
messenger
will
you
trust
me
a
murmur
of
astonishment
ran
round
the
assembly
the
personal
friends
of
jack
and
they
were
many
began
to
protest
against
his
exposing
himself
to
so
great
a
danger
and
indeed
every
one
thought
his
life
too
valuable
to
be
lightly
risked
what
would
my
sister
say
kevork
whispered
and
jack
answered
she
would
say
haadet
allà
the
lord
be
with
you
then
raising
his
voice
it
is
the
best
way
all
round
if
you
will
look
at
it
you
need
not
endanger
me
or
yourselves
by
writing
anything
for
i
know
all
and
can
tell
it
if
i
am
caught
i
have
still
a
good
chance
of
escape
for
i
will
tell
the
turks
i
am
an
englishman
and
that
they
touch
me
at
their
peril
they
will
not
believe
you
and
you
have
no
proof
to
offer
said
old
hohannes
with
a
face
of
much
concern
for
he
loved
yon
effendi
as
a
son
i
proof
father
i
can
speak
and
write
english
for
their
edification
and
talk
big
about
consuls
and
international
law
and
the
power
of
england
whereas
if
i
am
taken
the
gain
is
great
an
englishman
who
has
seen
what
i
have
can
say
things
the
english
and
the
rest
of
the
world
ought
to
hear
and
there
is
none
to
tell
them
amaan
that
is
true
several
voices
said
and
do
not
forget
for
do
not
jack
went
on
what
i
stand
to
win
once
free
i
think
i
can
help
myself
and
you
too
far
better
than
by
staying
here
if
it
were
to
abandon
you
i
would
never
go
here
or
there
i
mean
to
see
this
thing
through
with
you
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
do
more
just
now
there
than
here
how
will
you
disguise
yourself
some
one
asked
i
can
wear
the
kourdish
dress
that
served
me
coming
here
but
you
do
not
know
the
country
another
objected
as
far
as
biridjik
i
know
it
well
trust
me
to
find
out
the
rest
finally
jack
proposal
was
agreed
to
by
all
except
indeed
by
hohannes
who
kept
silence
but
did
not
change
his
mind
the
meeting
broke
up
as
soon
as
the
heads
of
it
had
arranged
for
jack
to
come
to
them
at
a
later
hour
to
receive
messages
and
other
instructions
for
his
dangerous
mission
as
they
went
out
together
kevork
laid
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
brother
he
said
do
you
not
desire
to
see
shushan
again
before
you
go
i
think
it
might
be
managed
for
you
with
backsheesh
to
the
zaptiehs
jack
thought
a
moment
then
he
answered
with
a
decided
no
we
have
had
our
farewells
he
added
it
is
best
not
to
alarm
her
in
his
own
heart
he
said
i
had
rather
keep
the
last
words
she
spoke
to
me
cross
of
christ
has
been
laid
upon
us
together
nothing
can
part
us
after
that
but
he
took
his
father
the
one
precious
relic
that
remained
to
him
wrote
a
few
tender
words
in
it
wrapped
it
up
carefully
and
gave
it
to
kevork
to
give
her
in
case
anything
happened
to
him
at
the
later
consultation
it
was
decided
that
jack
should
not
wear
the
kourdish
dress
it
was
thought
he
could
not
keep
up
the
character
sufficiently
to
disarm
suspicion
a
proposition
that
he
should
go
dressed
la
was
negatived
also
since
a
person
so
attired
would
never
be
found
travelling
alone
at
last
a
disguise
was
found
for
him
the
dress
of
an
armenian
peasant
of
the
very
humblest
class
a
countryman
it
was
hoped
that
the
appearance
of
utter
poverty
and
of
ignorance
might
secure
his
safety
it
was
december
now
and
the
nights
were
dark
as
dark
as
they
ever
are
in
that
southern
land
there
are
many
places
in
which
the
ancient
wall
of
urfa
is
much
broken
down
in
some
it
is
only
three
feet
high
with
stones
and
rubbish
and
broken
masonry
all
about
stealthily
and
noiselessly
jack
crept
towards
one
of
these
there
was
no
difficulty
in
getting
over
the
wall
but
then
at
the
other
side
there
was
a
natural
rock
to
be
descended
almost
a
precipice
this
also
however
the
agile
youth
accomplished
and
stood
in
safety
at
the
bottom
his
next
difficulty
was
to
elude
the
turkish
patrol
which
passed
frequently
during
the
night
seeing
it
at
a
distance
he
laid
himself
down
quite
flat
amongst
the
stones
until
the
men
had
passed
and
everything
was
perfectly
quiet
then
he
cautiously
set
out
upon
his
journey
passing
through
fields
and
vineyards
and
striking
into
the
roman
road
where
he
had
ridden
with
shushan
three
months
before
although
the
weather
was
now
cold
he
intended
to
travel
by
night
and
rest
during
the
day
in
order
to
minimize
the
dangers
of
discovery
yet
three
hours
later
the
die
was
cast
and
his
fate
was
sealed
a
party
of
turkish
horsemen
who
were
conveying
some
prisoners
into
the
town
saw
at
a
distance
in
the
morning
light
his
dark
figure
thrown
out
by
the
white
path
behind
him
he
knew
they
had
seen
him
but
there
was
no
place
near
where
it
was
possible
to
conceal
himself
so
his
only
chance
was
to
pass
on
boldly
in
his
assumed
character
the
captain
of
the
troop
took
little
heed
of
him
just
flinging
him
a
curse
in
passing
as
one
beneath
his
notice
unhappily
amongst
the
band
of
wretched
prisoners
all
the
more
wretched
for
having
had
to
keep
up
on
foot
with
the
riding
of
the
turks
jack
saw
a
face
he
knew
der
garabed
the
priest
of
biridjik
no
fear
of
consequences
could
keep
the
look
of
grief
and
pity
out
of
his
eyes
it
was
observed
as
also
was
the
captive
quick
glance
of
recognition
changed
though
it
was
immediately
into
the
dull
vacant
stare
his
race
have
a
wonderful
power
of
assuming
the
captain
gave
a
rapid
order
and
jack
was
surrounded
and
seized
asked
what
his
name
was
he
answered
boldly
john
grayson
i
am
an
englishman
this
was
received
with
a
shout
of
laughter
by
the
prophet
a
likely
story
the
captain
said
english
effendis
do
not
go
about
the
country
alone
and
in
rags
more
probably
a
zeitounli
prowling
about
to
stir
up
rebellion
i
can
prove
my
words
jack
said
i
am
an
englishman
i
put
on
this
dress
to
get
down
to
the
coast
in
safety
as
the
country
is
disturbed
i
have
never
been
in
zeitoun
i
can
prove
what
i
am
those
who
hurt
the
english
have
to
pay
for
it
those
who
help
them
get
well
paid
themselves
in
good
medjidis
the
last
word
had
rather
a
softening
influence
of
what
religion
are
you
the
captain
asked
of
the
religion
of
the
english
jack
answered
promptly
the
captain
hesitated
for
a
moment
captain
shouted
a
turk
from
his
following
the
giaour
is
lying
he
is
no
english
effendi
but
an
armenian
of
urfa
i
saw
his
face
that
day
there
was
fighting
he
had
a
revolver
in
his
hand
and
shot
true
believers
with
it
is
that
so
then
he
goes
to
the
kadi
said
the
captain
his
momentary
hesitation
at
an
end
bind
him
men
in
the
name
of
allah
the
merciful
you
are
an
impudent
liar
like
all
your
race
he
said
to
jack
turning
away
with
a
curse
jack
hoped
he
might
be
able
to
speak
to
the
priest
but
this
boon
was
denied
him
he
was
placed
at
the
other
end
of
the
file
of
captives
the
man
to
whom
he
was
bound
seemed
either
afraid
or
too
thoroughly
crushed
and
dejected
to
speak
to
him
his
own
state
of
mind
was
not
enviable
his
first
feeling
was
that
he
had
failed
he
meant
to
do
such
great
things
he
had
gone
forth
full
of
hope
and
courage
as
one
who
should
work
a
great
deliverance
in
the
earth
and
now
and
now
what
would
they
all
feel
all
the
friends
who
loved
and
trusted
him
so
they
would
be
waiting
wondering
speculating
about
his
fate
their
anxiety
would
change
into
suspense
their
suspense
would
deepen
at
last
into
sad
certainty
yet
most
likely
there
would
be
none
to
tell
of
his
fate
and
shushan
the
thought
of
her
sorrow
swallowed
up
all
other
thoughts
all
other
regrets
and
shushan
for
her
dear
sake
he
would
not
give
up
hope
he
would
struggle
on
even
to
the
end
his
english
name
and
his
english
race
might
save
him
yet
not
likely
after
those
fatal
shots
meanwhile
at
the
present
moment
where
was
he
whither
was
he
going
all
the
stories
which
in
the
last
five
years
he
had
heard
spoken
with
bated
breath
of
the
horrors
of
turkish
prisons
rushed
like
a
sea
of
bitter
waters
over
his
soul
they
brought
with
them
a
sensation
absolutely
new
to
him
utter
unreasoning
overpowering
terror
and
anguish
took
hold
on
him
large
drops
like
the
touch
of
cold
fingers
stood
upon
his
forehead
he
shivered
from
head
to
foot
he
had
faced
death
before
this
and
it
had
seemed
to
him
but
a
light
thing
after
that
no
more
that
they
can
do
after
that
but
how
much
before
oh
god
of
mercy
how
much
before
all
at
once
stepanian
voice
seemed
sounding
in
his
ears
you
must
trust
god
utterly
wherever
they
might
bring
him
whatever
they
might
do
with
him
would
be
he
could
not
get
out
of
that
presence
nor
could
they
a
thrill
shot
through
him
of
hope
restored
and
strength
renewed
a
vision
of
conflict
over
and
victory
won
at
last
as
a
cry
unto
one
that
hears
his
prayer
went
up
oh
god
of
my
fathers
i
beseech
thee
suffer
me
not
through
any
pains
of
death
to
fall
from
thee
suffer
me
not
to
deny
my
faith
nor
yet
to
accuse
my
brethren
in
the
name
of
christ
my
redeemer
while
he
thought
of
god
he
was
calm
when
he
thought
of
his
chances
of
what
might
happen
to
him
of
whether
any
one
would
believe
his
story
the
dark
fears
came
again
even
of
shushan
it
did
not
do
to
think
too
much
just
now
he
could
only
commend
her
to
god
constitutionally
he
was
brave
and
fearless
but
to
think
of
a
turkish
prison
without
shuddering
requires
much
more
than
constitutional
bravery
either
nerves
of
adamant
or
faith
to
remove
mountains
perhaps
not
either
perhaps
not
both
together
could
prevent
the
anguish
of
anticipation
whatever
strength
might
be
given
for
actual
endurance
back
again
in
urfa
and
at
the
government
house
where
he
had
seen
melkon
witness
his
brave
confession
jack
found
that
his
story
would
not
be
listened
to
for
a
moment
some
of
the
captives
were
taken
away
he
knew
not
whither
others
along
with
himself
were
led
within
the
gloomy
gates
of
the
prison
and
after
passing
through
several
dark
passages
thrust
into
a
room
or
cell
as
well
as
he
could
discern
by
the
light
that
streamed
from
a
narrow
window
high
up
in
the
wall
this
cell
was
already
full
nay
crowded
men
standing
packed
together
as
those
who
wait
for
a
door
to
open
and
admit
them
to
some
grand
spectacle
i
suppose
he
thought
they
will
take
us
out
for
some
sort
of
trial
but
what
stifling
foetid
horrible
air
enough
to
breed
a
pestilence
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
sit
down
difficult
even
to
raise
a
hand
or
move
a
foot
so
dense
was
the
crush
occasional
thrills
through
the
living
mass
told
that
some
wretch
was
making
a
frantic
effort
to
get
a
little
air
and
thus
increasing
the
misery
of
his
neighbours
jack
contrived
to
say
to
a
companion
in
misfortune
whose
ear
touched
his
mouth
how
long
will
they
keep
us
here
at
first
the
only
answer
was
a
mournful
amaan
followed
by
piteous
groans
he
repeated
the
question
how
long
will
they
keep
us
in
this
horrible
place
as
long
as
they
can
gasped
the
man
he
had
addressed
until
death
sets
us
why
not
it
is
the
prison
but
another
hissed
into
his
ear
no
it
is
hell
i
make
my
bed
in
hell
behold
thou
art
there
john
grayson
thought
with
a
brave
effort
to
cling
to
his
faith
and
his
god
he
said
aloud
god
is
here
let
us
cry
to
him
god
has
forsaken
us
said
the
last
speaker
but
from
two
or
three
others
came
the
feebly
murmured
prayer
jesus
help
us
jesus
help
us
time
passed
on
jack
would
have
given
all
the
wealth
he
could
claim
in
england
were
it
here
and
in
his
hand
simply
for
one
square
yard
of
the
ground
beneath
his
feet
to
rest
upon
it
was
long
since
every
limb
had
ached
with
intolerable
weariness
now
the
dull
ache
was
succeeded
by
shooting
agonizing
pains
he
was
too
sick
for
hunger
but
the
thirst
was
terrible
and
the
sense
of
suffocation
came
in
spasms
that
made
him
want
to
tear
a
passage
with
teeth
and
nails
through
the
living
mass
about
him
once
the
pressure
becoming
heavier
made
him
try
to
look
round
near
him
a
man
had
swooned
was
it
a
swoon
or
was
it
death
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
livid
face
between
two
others
for
there
was
no
room
for
the
fainting
or
even
for
the
dead
to
fall
time
passed
on
he
felt
his
strength
forsaking
him
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
voice
sounded
hollow
and
unlike
itself
was
he
dying
he
thought
this
numbness
and
faintness
might
mean
but
then
perhaps
the
wish
was
father
to
the
thought
he
was
young
and
strong
and
such
do
not
quickly
die
time
passed
on
shushan
was
in
his
thoughts
continually
with
the
wish
with
the
prayer
often
that
she
might
never
know
thank
god
there
was
something
to
thank
god
for
even
here
she
did
not
know
now
miss
celandine
would
take
care
of
her
and
sometime
somewhere
when
all
this
agony
was
over
they
would
meet
again
was
the
cross
of
christ
time
passed
on
the
numbness
in
his
limbs
increased
he
began
to
lose
himself
a
little
now
and
then
he
was
at
pastor
stepanian
church
in
biridjik
in
england
even
then
he
would
come
suddenly
back
again
with
a
thrill
of
anguish
to
the
horrible
present
yet
he
was
not
dying
he
was
not
fainting
even
strange
to
say
he
was
only
falling
asleep
even
upon
the
cross
men
have
slept
at
last
no
more
light
came
in
through
the
little
grated
window
it
was
night
time
passed
on
a
sounder
slumber
than
before
came
mercifully
to
steep
his
senses
in
oblivion
he
was
in
england
in
his
old
home
in
the
orchard
was
one
particular
tree
he
used
to
be
very
fond
of
climbing
in
spite
of
his
father
warning
take
care
my
boy
you
will
break
your
bones
some
day
he
thought
now
that
he
had
fallen
from
the
highest
branch
and
was
laid
on
his
bed
a
mass
of
fractures
and
bruises
calling
on
the
surgeons
whose
faces
he
saw
distinctly
to
give
him
chloroform
anything
to
stop
the
pain
and
bring
unconsciousness
was
he
crying
out
at
the
pitch
of
his
voice
and
doing
shame
to
his
manhood
he
awoke
in
horror
shriek
after
shriek
though
not
from
lips
rent
the
midnight
air
to
those
who
only
know
what
the
human
voice
can
do
by
the
cries
of
childish
pain
or
fear
a
strong
man
shriek
of
agony
is
an
unimaginable
horror
oh
what
is
it
jack
cried
aloud
his
own
voice
a
wail
some
one
is
being
tortured
in
the
next
cell
to
this
a
weary
indifferent
voice
made
answer
the
shrieks
went
on
interspersed
with
short
intervals
of
silence
and
with
deep
heavy
groans
there
were
words
too
heard
more
or
less
distinctly
cries
for
mercy
agonized
prayers
then
in
a
higher
key
i
know
nothing
nothing
you
are
killing
me
and
again
kill
me
in
the
name
of
god
i
implore
of
you
to
kill
me
once
more
as
if
flung
out
with
all
the
remaining
strength
of
dying
lips
no
no
no
no
it
is
only
said
the
man
who
had
spoken
last
some
one
who
refuses
to
accuse
his
friends
god
help
him
jack
murmured
feebly
for
a
little
while
the
cries
died
away
then
they
began
again
culminating
in
a
shriek
so
appalling
that
jack
senses
failed
him
with
the
horror
and
at
last
unconsciousness
took
him
out
of
his
misery
a
waft
of
cooler
air
revived
him
when
he
came
to
himself
he
lay
amongst
a
number
of
fallen
or
falling
bodies
then
some
one
was
dragging
him
along
as
it
seemed
through
some
passage
towards
the
light
where
am
i
he
asked
trying
mechanically
to
shake
off
the
hand
that
held
him
then
he
saw
that
he
was
between
two
zaptiehs
who
were
laughing
at
his
feeble
efforts
to
get
free
he
thought
it
very
likely
they
were
going
to
kill
him
and
he
did
not
care
yet
their
intentions
did
not
seem
at
the
moment
particularly
cruel
one
of
them
pointed
to
a
place
near
the
wall
and
told
him
to
sit
down
and
rest
the
other
fetched
him
a
cup
of
water
incomparably
the
most
delicious
draught
he
had
ever
tasted
then
they
half
led
half
dragged
him
into
an
open
court
where
many
other
prisoners
were
waiting
he
looked
on
dreamily
while
several
of
these
were
led
up
to
the
kadi
who
sat
in
state
on
the
divan
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
after
a
brief
examination
sometimes
a
few
words
only
were
led
away
again
by
the
zaptiehs
at
last
his
own
turn
came
he
could
manage
to
stand
alone
now
though
he
still
felt
confused
and
bewildered
he
was
asked
his
name
and
he
gave
it
in
full
but
here
strength
and
memory
seemed
to
fail
him
together
he
knew
there
was
he
wanted
to
say
but
he
could
not
remember
what
it
was
he
looked
around
him
blankly
helplessly
and
the
next
moment
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
if
one
of
the
zaptiehs
had
not
caught
him
and
held
him
up
the
next
thing
he
heard
was
the
voice
of
the
kadi
addressing
him
again
listen
said
the
zaptieh
his
excellency
condescends
to
enquire
if
you
are
a
true
believer
i
am
said
jack
are
you
then
of
the
creed
of
islam
he
stood
up
straight
and
looked
the
kadi
in
the
face
no
he
answered
will
you
become
a
convert
to
the
creed
of
islam
no
he
said
again
since
we
are
inclined
to
mercy
we
will
give
you
a
week
to
think
the
matter
over
after
that
if
you
refuse
again
you
must
die
i
had
rather
you
would
kill
me
at
once
jack
said
it
is
not
the
will
of
allah
the
kadi
replied
guards
take
the
prisoner
away
he
was
led
presently
to
another
dungeon
where
at
least
there
was
room
to
stretch
his
weary
aching
limbs
at
full
length
on
the
ground
and
where
from
utter
exhaustion
he
almost
immediately
fell
asleep
chapter

the

turns

the
thousands
that
uncheered
by
praise
have
made
one
offering
of
their
days
for
truth
for

for

resigned

john
grayson
awoke
from
his
long
sleep
though
still
aching
all
over
he
was
much
refreshed
and
strengthened
nature
was
putting
forth
her
recuperative
powers
in
his
young
and
vigorous
frame
for
a
while
he
lay
quite
still
the
light
was
dim
the
ground
beneath
him
foul
and
muddy
and
he
could
see
nothing
not
even
a
mat
in
the
way
of
furniture
but
he
soon
became
aware
that
he
was
not
alone
there
were
several
persons
in
the
room
or
cell
and
they
were
conversing
together
in
low
tones
mingling
their
words
with
many
a
sigh
and
many
a
murmured
amaan
or
jesus
help
us
one
spoke
of
his
large
family
of
little
children
how
hard
to
leave
them
destitute
another
of
his
wife
a
third
of
his
aged
father
who
was
blind
a
fourth
of
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
in
him
jack
recognised
the
voice
of
a
friend
of
the
vartonians
who
had
been
away
at
the
vineyards
when
the
storm
burst
upon
his
people
he
raised
his
head
is
that
you
kaspar
hohanian
he
asked
djanum
cried
the
young
man
coming
towards
him
and
looking
at
him
attentively
friends
this
is
yon
effendi
the
englishman
who
married
oriort
shushan
meneshian
most
of
the
twelve
or
fifteen
prisoners
who
were
shut
up
there
together
knew
his
story
and
all
gathered
round
him
with
sympathy
and
interest
in
the
awful
strain
of
their
position
any
momentary
distraction
was
a
relief
how
had
he
come
there
they
asked
it
happened
that
they
had
all
been
imprisoned
before
he
set
out
on
his
desperate
errand
some
like
kaspar
had
been
found
outside
the
armenian
quarter
others
had
been
arrested
by
the
redifs
on
various
pretexts
within
it
but
jack
before
he
told
his
story
asked
if
they
could
give
him
any
food
for
he
was
exhausted
with
hunger
all
they
had
to
offer
was
a
piece
of
hard
black
bread
defiled
by
the
mud
and
filth
into
which
it
had
been
purposely
thrown
by
their
jailors
and
a
draught
of
water
by
no
means
either
clean
or
fresh
but
even
for
these
he
was
very
thankful
and
ate
and
drank
with
eagerness
kaspar
hohanian
quoted
to
him
a
proverb
of
their
race
and
drink
and
talk
afterwards
says
the
turk
and
drink
and
talk
at
the
same
time
says
the
armenian
at
all
events
while
i
eat
you
can
talk
to
me
jack
said
with
his
mouth
full
your
people
thought
you
were
dead
baron
kaspar
the
turks
killed
all
my
companions
oh
and
so
cruelly
he
answered
with
a
shudder
but
an
acquaintance
i
had
among
them
persuaded
them
instead
of
killing
me
at
once
to
tie
me
to
one
of
the
tall
upright
tombstones
in
their
cemetery
outside
the
gate
their
thought
was
to
leave
me
there
to
die
of
hunger
my
friend
as
he
whispered
was
to
come
back
at
night
and
release
me
but
amaan
the
patrol
came
along
before
he
did
took
me
and
brought
me
here
and
now
i
have
a
week
given
me
to
choose
between
islam
and
death
it
is
hard
they
were
all
as
it
seemed
in
like
case
only
the
period
of
respite
varied
a
little
meanwhile
it
relaxed
the
intolerable
tension
of
their
thoughts
and
wiled
away
a
few
weary
hours
to
tell
and
to
hear
each
other
histories
jack
accordingly
gave
his
expressing
sorrow
for
the
fate
of
der
garabed
the
priest
of
biridjik
and
asking
if
any
one
present
knew
anything
about
him
no
one
did
and
while
they
were
discussing
the
matter
the
prison
door
was
opened
and
another
captive
led
or
rather
thrust
in
to
join
their
mournful
company
he
was
a
man
of
middle
age
and
well
dressed
in
european
fashion
but
his
head
was
bowed
down
and
his
fez
pulled
low
over
his
face
his
arms
hung
helplessly
by
his
side
and
his
whole
manner
and
bearing
showed
the
most
utter
dejection
jack
sprang
up
and
came
to
him
at
once
with
an
exclamation
of
pity
and
sorrow
baron
muggurditch
thomassian
he
said
do
speak
to
me
said
thomassian
turning
on
him
a
look
of
unutterable
anguish
he
went
to
the
most
distant
corner
of
the
prison
the
rest
making
way
for
him
no
one
ventured
to
approach
him
with
enquiries
or
condolences
though
they
all
knew
him
by
sight
and
several
were
amongst
his
acquaintances
he
sat
down
or
rather
lay
down
upon
the
ground
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
wall
low
furtive
whispers
passed
among
the
others
so
much
to
lose
what
can
all
his
money
do
now
better
had
he
shown
mercy
and
given
to
the
poor
but
these
were
quickly
hushed
lest
he
should
overhear
they
did
not
want
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
the
unhappy
man
whom
indeed
they
would
have
gladly
comforted
if
they
had
known
how
but
as
this
seemed
impossible
they
left
him
to
himself
and
their
talk
soon
wandered
back
to
their
own
situation
and
the
momentous
choice
that
was
set
before
them
some
were
steadfast
and
comparatively
serene
others
wavered
and
two
or
three
seemed
disposed
to
give
way
all
prayed
much
and
often
most
of
them
could
sing
and
led
by
a
few
of
the
braver
spirits
they
made
the
gloomy
walls
resound
with
psalms
and
hymns
especially
with
that
favourite
of
the
armenians
jesus
i
my
cross
have
taken
once
john
grayson
voice
broke
down
in
singing
it
for
he
heard
shushan
saying
to
him
the
cross
of
christ
has
been
laid
on
us
together
only
if
it
could
be
that
he
might
bear
the
heaviest
end
and
that
she
need
never
know
of
all
this
meanwhile
thomassian
never
spoke
and
scarcely
ever
moved
from
the
place
where
he
sat
or
lay
his
face
turned
away
from
the
rest
he
ate
little
and
they
could
not
see
that
he
slept
once
or
twice
they
noticed
that
his
tears
were
falling
silently
but
not
even
a
groan
or
sigh
told
of
the
anguish
of
his
soul
the
days
seemed
unending
but
still
they
drew
towards
an
end
ay
and
far
too
quickly
for
those
who
looked
forward
with
unutterable
dread
to
what
was
to
come
after
the
only
breaks
in
the
monotony
were
the
jailor
daily
visits
with
bread
and
water
generally
he
came
and
went
without
a
word
but
on
the
evening
of
their
last
day
of
grace
he
broke
the
silence
you
giaours
had
better
be
learning
your
illaha
ill
he
said
for
if
you
have
not
got
it
off
by
morning
you
die
like
the
dogs
you
are
then
he
shut
the
door
and
left
them
to
themselves
there
was
a
long
silence
only
interrupted
by
a
few
sorrowful
amaans
it
was
broken
at
last
by
the
youngest
in
the
room
a
lad
of
some
eighteen
years
i
would
not
be
afraid
he
said
plaintively
if
i
thought
they
would
kill
us
at
once
were
it
only
a
shot
or
a
that
were
easy
to
bear
but
to
be
killed
slowly
cut
in
little
pieces
or
perhaps
like
some
hush
boy
kaspar
hohanian
interrupted
whatever
they
do
to
us
it
must
be
over
sometime
and
then
there
is
heaven
beyond
ay
said
an
older
man
there
is
heaven
for
after
a
brief
agony
but
friends
we
have
not
ourselves
alone
to
think
of
there
are
our
wives
and
children
true
another
chimed
in
if
we
die
they
starve
if
we
die
they
do
worse
than
starve
the
former
speaker
resumed
to
fate
do
we
leave
our
women
our
girls
you
know
it
brothers
whereas
if
we
turn
moslems
they
will
be
safe
and
under
protection
you
are
speaking
well
observed
a
third
and
i
can
not
think
for
my
part
that
the
lord
jesus
will
be
angry
with
us
when
he
knows
all
has
he
not
given
us
our
families
to
take
care
of
does
not
his
holy
apostle
say
in
his
letter
any
provide
not
for
his
own
and
specially
for
those
of
his
own
house
he
hath
denied
the
faith
and
is
worse
than
an
infidel
if
we
deny
the
faith
and
be
infidels
it
seems
as
well
to
do
it
one
way
as
another
and
i
have
my
old
father
to
think
of
he
will
die
of
grief
a
sad
voice
murmured
that
loveth
father
or
mother
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
and
he
that
loveth
son
or
daughter
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
said
another
voice
unheard
till
then
amongst
them
thomassian
rose
up
in
his
place
and
looked
around
him
on
the
group
his
whole
appearance
was
changed
transfigured
his
look
firm
and
fearless
his
eyes
shining
as
if
with
some
inner
light
my
brothers
he
said
you
think
i
have
no
right
to
speak
to
you
that
it
ill
becomes
to
take
upon
my
lips
the
words
of
my
lord
and
saviour
and
you
think
that
which
is
true
no
no
murmured
two
or
three
unwilling
in
that
supreme
hour
to
give
pain
to
a
but
kaspar
said
more
frankly
to
confess
the
truth
we
none
of
us
thought
you
were
a
religious
man
baron
thomassian
i
was
i
lived
for
the
things
seen
not
for
the
things
unseen
which
are
eternal
very
early
i
said
to
myself
am
an
armenian
one
of
an
oppressed
race
i
can
not
rise
make
a
mark
in
the
world
and
win
its
splendid
prizes
yet
i
have
brains
i
have
the
power
to
will
to
plan
to
execute
what
can
i
do
there
was
but
one
answer
can
get
wealth
and
wealth
means
safety
enjoyment
influence
so
i
tried
to
get
wealth
and
i
got
it
by
honest
industry
at
least
in
the
beginning
my
hands
were
clean
enough
i
prospered
i
surrounded
myself
with
comforts
with
luxuries
i
took
to
wife
a
lady
whom
god
help
me
i
love
as
truly
as
any
man
among
you
loves
his
own
but
ah
me
i
forgot
god
so
no
doubt
have
we
all
some
more
some
less
said
kaspar
hohanian
if
there
is
any
one
here
who
feels
let
him
look
up
and
take
comfort
thomassian
went
on
for
not
one
among
you
has
gone
from
him
so
far
as
i
but
though
i
forgot
him
he
has
remembered
me
i
was
led
on
from
one
thing
to
another
until
for
the
sake
of
gain
i
did
some
things
of
which
the
thought
can
sting
me
even
now
i
was
hard
upon
the
poor
and
upon
my
debtors
i
did
wrong
in
various
ways
and
even
to
some
who
trusted
me
john
grayson
you
are
one
of
those
i
wronged
jack
started
at
the
unexpected
utterance
of
his
name
it
is
no
time
now
to
think
of
wrongs
he
said
no
for
him
who
has
suffered
yes
for
him
who
has
done
the
wrong
after
that
time
i
saw
you
in
biridjik
i
went
indeed
to
aleppo
but
i
did
not
take
your
letter
with
me
nor
did
i
speak
for
you
to
the
consul
for
he
and
i
just
then
were
at
daggers
drawn
i
had
used
his
name
and
influence
and
the
presence
of
his
dragoman
to
pass
through
the
custom
house
some
prohibited
drugs
he
was
angry
and
with
reason
i
did
not
dare
to
face
him
i
wanted
to
be
rid
of
your
letter
for
fear
of
complications
so
i
just
dropped
it
into
the
post
office
at
tel
bascher
where
i
have
little
doubt
it
lies
until
this
day
then
my
friends
have
been
false
to
me
jack
said
much
moved
and
if
my
letter
had
come
to
them
they
might
have
saved
me
and
shushan
his
heart
added
thomassian
came
over
close
to
him
and
stretched
out
his
hand
can
you
forgive
me
he
asked
jack
was
silent
for
just
a
moment
then
he
said
slowly
we
forgive
them
that
trespass
against
us
yes
baron
thomassian
i
forgive
you
in
his
name
whom
we
hope
so
soon
to
see
but
oh
how
i
wish
you
had
spoken
he
could
not
help
thinking
tho
he
crushed
back
the
words
in
time
do
think
it
would
have
made
a
difference
he
said
i
forgive
you
with
all
my
heart
it
might
have
changed
everything
or
it
might
not
thomassian
said
mournfully
i
have
no
power
now
to
undo
that
wrong
or
any
of
the
others
i
have
done
friends
while
i
sat
in
silence
yonder
my
face
turned
from
you
all
the
sins
of
my
whole
life
came
upon
me
they
swept
over
my
head
like
black
waters
they
seemed
to
choke
my
very
life
out
the
thought
of
death
was
terrible
i
not
die
and
go
into
presence
thus
and
yet
to
give
up
my
faith
would
only
be
to
add
another
sin
and
one
for
which
there
is
no
pardon
oh
no
jack
threw
in
that
is
too
hard
a
saying
surely
thomassian
said
if
you
go
away
from
the
light
you
must
remain
in
darkness
if
you
go
away
from
the
christ
you
must
remain
unforgiven
that
was
what
i
came
to
in
those
days
of
anguish
i
thought
i
not
let
christ
go
i
know
now
it
was
christ
that
would
not
let
me
go
my
brothers
all
that
time
that
i
lay
silent
there
not
joining
in
your
prayers
your
hymns
your
my
whole
heart
has
been
one
desperate
cry
to
him
christ
forgive
me
even
now
at
this
eleventh
hour
take
my
spoiled
life
and
receive
me
into
thy
kingdom
there
was
a
silence
has
he
heard
kaspar
asked
at
last
thomassian
bowed
his
head
low
and
veiled
his
face
with
both
hands
i
stand
among
you
confounded
and
ashamed
he
said
because
god
was
silent
to
you
said
the
youth
dikran
in
a
pitying
voice
because
god
was
silent
to
me
thomassian
answered
removing
his
hands
and
turning
on
them
a
face
full
of
gladness
because
to
me
the
last
and
least
of
you
to
me
who
had
forgotten
him
and
sinned
against
him
so
even
to
me
he
has
revealed
himself
how
asked
two
or
three
drawing
near
him
with
looks
of
reverence
how
i
can
not
tell
you
that
may
no
man
tell
or
understand
myself
least
of
all
called
upon
thy
name
oh
lord
out
of
the
low
dungeon
thou
drewedst
near
in
the
day
that
i
called
upon
thee
thou
saidst
fear
not
after
all
though
no
man
may
understand
it
yet
it
is
a
very
simple
thing
i
the
worst
among
you
have
taken
god
at
his
word
and
claimed
his
promise
of
forgiveness
for
the
lord
christ
sake
i
had
so
much
to
be
forgiven
there
was
no
other
way
and
he
has
forgiven
he
has
done
more
he
has
given
peace
such
peace
as
i
could
never
dream
of
i
am
to
die
for
him
now
i
have
no
fear
of
man
not
from
the
fear
but
from
the
love
of
him
not
because
if
i
forsake
him
he
will
forsake
me
but
because
i
know
he
never
will
forsake
me
neither
in
life
nor
in
death
nor
in
the
life
beyond
there
was
silence
when
he
ended
at
last
the
oldest
man
amongst
them
stretched
out
his
hand
to
him
and
said
baron
thomassian
you
have
taught
us
a
lesson
you
are
better
than
the
rest
of
us
another
said
impulsively
better
no
worse
a
thousand
times
not
worthy
to
stand
amongst
you
as
one
of
christ
martyrs
but
since
he
has
this
joy
to
give
to
me
the
last
and
least
think
what
gifts
he
must
have
for
his
true
and
faithful
servants
certainly
he
will
not
forsake
us
in
the
hour
of
death
kaspar
said
baron
thomassian
i
take
this
answer
of
god
to
your
prayer
as
a
token
of
good
for
us
all
my
mind
is
made
up
said
a
quiet
elderly
man
who
had
not
spoken
hitherto
let
them
do
their
worst
i
stand
by
the
lord
christ
and
i
trust
the
lord
christ
to
stand
by
me
then
dikran
the
youngest
of
them
all
spoke
up
too
i
think
it
is
scarce
so
hard
for
me
as
for
the
rest
of
you
for
i
am
an
orphan
and
my
only
brother
was
killed
in
the
fighting
two
months
ago
all
through
it
was
not
death
it
was
agony
i
feared
but
now
i
know
christ
will
help
me
through
that
and
he
will
care
for
those
we
leave
after
us
another
said
in
a
low
voice
yon
effendi
have
not
spoken
yet
said
kaspar
john
grayson
started
as
if
from
a
dream
there
is
only
one
thing
to
say
he
answered
firmly
i
stand
by
christ
so
likewise
said
they
all
in
prayer
and
mutual
and
encouragement
the
long
night
wore
on
amongst
them
all
there
was
only
one
who
slept
worn
out
with
his
long
and
bitter
conflict
and
at
rest
in
the
ineffable
peace
in
which
it
ended
thomassian
fell
into
a
dreamless
sleep
with
his
head
pillowed
on
john
grayson
knee
jack
himself
feared
to
sleep
on
account
of
the
waking
that
must
follow
he
prayed
thought
of
his
past
life
of
his
father
and
all
his
friends
above
all
of
shushan
often
his
mind
would
wander
for
a
little
amongst
unconsidered
trifles
but
it
always
turned
back
again
to
the
things
which
made
its
home
the
morning
light
stole
at
last
through
their
narrow
grated
window
thomassian
stirred
and
sat
up
he
looked
round
upon
them
all
with
a
smile
but
his
eyes
grew
grave
and
full
of
thought
as
they
rested
on
the
face
of
john
grayson
who
just
then
was
absorbed
in
what
he
thought
might
be
his
last
prayer
for
shushan
yon
effendi
he
said
are
you
ready
to
die
jack
looked
at
him
steadily
for
a
moment
then
bowed
his
head
in
silence
but
you
would
rather
live
if
it
were
the
will
of
god
is
it
not
so
i
do
not
seem
to
care
not
greatly
jack
said
it
seems
easy
to
die
with
you
all
but
his
voice
sank
low
but
there
is
shushan
and
if
i
can
in
some
slight
measure
atone
for
the
harm
i
have
done
you
you
will
be
glad
for
her
sake
but
do
not
build
on
it
it
is
but
a
chance
rather
since
there
is
no
chance
really
it
will
be
as
god
wills
hush
some
one
suddenly
exclaimed
the
key
was
grating
in
the
door
in
another
minute
it
was
thrown
open
and
the
jailor
entered
he
did
not
waste
words
come
he
said
the
band
of
confessors
rose
to
their
feet
and
looked
one
another
in
the
face
one
moment
i
pray
of
you
kaspar
said
in
turkish
to
the
jailor
then
in
armenian
let
us
bid
each
other
farewell
not
so
thomassian
answered
smiling
it
is
not
worth
while
we
shall
meet
so
soon
with
joy
in
the
presence
of
our
lord
as
they
went
forth
john
grayson
thought
once
more
of
the
last
words
he
had
heard
his
father
say
the
dark
river
turns
to
light
it
was
the
morning
of
christmas
day
chapter
xvii
a
great
crime
the
clinging
children
at
their
mother
knee
slain
and
the
sire
and
kindred
one
by
one
flayed
or
hewn
piecemeal
and
things
nameless
done
not
to
be
told
while
imperturbably
the
nations
gaze
where
rhine
unto
the
sea
where
seine
and
danube
thames
and
tiber
run
and
where
great
armies
glitter
in
the
sun
and
great
kings
rule
and
man
is
boasted
free
the
purple
east
by
william
meanwhile
over
the
crowd
of
anxious
hearts
the
mission
house
sheltered
the
sad
days
went
slowly
by
shushan
fears
for
her
husband
could
find
no
relief
and
they
were
intensified
by
apprehensions
about
her
father
of
whose
state
disquieting
rumours
reached
her
her
entreaties
prevailed
on
miss
celandine
to
send
a
couple
of
her
zaptiehs
to
ascertain
the
truth
the
zaptiehs
brought
back
word
that
boghos
meneshian
was
dying
and
prayed
that
his
daughter
might
be
allowed
to
come
to
him
in
order
that
he
might
give
her
his
blessing
miss
celandine
sent
her
accordingly
in
the
charge
of
a
trusted
armenian
servant
and
with
a
guard
of
four
zaptiehs
this
was
early
on
the
morning
of
saturday
the
of
december
she
was
left
by
her
escort
at
the
house
of
the
selferians
where
her
father
had
been
staying
and
was
still
supposed
to
be
the
zaptiehs
promised
to
return
for
her
in
an
hour
the
armenian
said
he
would
be
close
at
hand
he
was
going
to
see
a
friend
in
a
neighbouring
house
oh
my
dear
oriort
shushan
said
hanum
selferian
hurrying
to
meet
her
in
the
name
of
god
what
brings
you
here
shushan
looked
at
her
in
amazement
i
have
come
to
see
my
father
she
said
how
is
he
well
enough
i
suppose
he
went
to
the
vartonians
cured
with
your
mother
mariam
hanum
about
a
week
ago
thank
god
said
shushan
drawing
a
long
breath
of
relief
they
told
me
he
was
dying
told
you
such
a
story
my
dear
he
is
dying
as
much
as
we
all
are
no
more
shushan
felt
surprised
and
uneasy
though
she
did
not
yet
know
perhaps
she
was
destined
never
to
know
that
she
was
the
victim
of
a
plot
it
may
be
she
said
a
shadow
crossing
her
face
that
they
told
me
wrong
about
the
house
i
ought
to
go
to
my
cousins
what
through
the
streets
you
can
not
not
even
if
my
husband
went
with
you
besides
if
the
zaptiehs
should
come
back
and
find
you
gone
no
oriort
shushan
this
is
what
we
will
do
my
husband
will
go
to
the
vartonians
and
if
possible
bring
your
father
to
see
you
here
i
like
not
to
take
him
from
his
work
josephine
hanum
what
signifies
his
work
there
is
little
enough
to
do
here
now
and
more
than
time
enough
to
do
it
in
hagop
selferian
who
was
at
work
stood
up
from
his
board
wiped
his
brow
and
threw
on
his
jacket
yes
i
will
go
he
said
shushan
remained
with
the
women
and
children
and
shared
the
pillav
that
formed
their
early
meal
afterwards
helping
josephine
hanum
in
her
pleasant
household
tasks
but
as
time
passed
on
she
grew
increasingly
anxious
i
wonder
the
zaptiehs
do
not
come
back
she
said
it
was
now
between
ten
and
eleven
in
the
forenoon
josephine
hanum
went
to
the
window
that
looked
out
upon
the
street
there
is
no
sign
of
them
she
said
but
here
comes
my
husband
he
crossed
the
court
and
came
in
looking
pale
and
frightened
my
father
shushan
breathed
only
one
cause
of
distress
occurring
to
her
mind
he
is
well
but
there
is
an
army
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
in
the
town
the
minarets
are
black
with
men
and
the
roofs
of
the
turkish
houses
with
women
and
children
jesus
help
us
what
is
going
to
happen
i
would
give
my
right
hand
to
have
you
back
in
the
mission
house
oriort
shushan
said
josephine
hanum
looking
at
her
guest
in
a
sort
of
despair
hagop
dost
think
thou
couldst
bring
her
there
selferian
shook
his
head
it
is
not
life
i
think
of
he
said
wife
i
met
in
the
street
that
syrian
who
used
to
work
with
me
mar
tomas
he
had
a
black
turban
on
and
was
hurrying
to
his
church
he
is
a
roman
catholic
you
know
it
seems
there
is
an
order
that
all
christians
who
are
not
armenians
are
to
go
to
their
churches
and
stay
there
all
the
day
and
they
are
not
to
let
a
single
armenian
cross
the
threshold
at
their
peril
here
krikor
the
eldest
boy
came
running
in
he
had
been
up
on
the
roof
father
mother
come
up
he
said
come
and
look
such
a
wonderful
sight
you
never
saw
a
sight
that
bodes
no
good
to
us
what
is
it
boy
oh
so
much
father
i
could
never
tell
you
come
and
look
all
four
mounted
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
flat
roof
the
younger
children
followed
them
eager
to
see
the
slope
of
the
hill
above
them
glittered
with
turkish
and
kourdish
soldiers
the
gay
dresses
of
the
latter
lending
animation
to
the
scene
and
the
swords
and
bayonets
of
all
flashing
in
the
sunlight
every
point
at
which
the
armenian
quarter
could
be
entered
bristled
with
soldiers
drawn
up
in
battle
array
while
behind
them
surged
and
swayed
a
savage
mob
men
and
boys
and
even
young
children
amongst
them
all
were
armed
many
with
guns
the
rest
with
daggers
knives
or
bludgeons
in
the
turkish
quarter
the
housetops
swarmed
with
women
and
above
the
confused
noises
of
the
great
city
above
the
hoarse
murmurs
of
the
soldiers
and
the
mob
was
heard
their
peculiar
called
the
zilghit
tchk
tchk
tchk
tchk
which
means
go
men
and
fight
for
mahomet
we
are
with
you
white
to
the
lips
selferian
turned
to
the
women
this
means
death
he
said
as
he
spoke
a
glittering
crescent
shone
out
on
the
fort
above
the
hill
catching
the
sunshine
on
its
glassy
disc
at
the
same
moment
a
green
flag
appeared
on
a
minaret
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
armenian
quarter
from
another
minaret
a
muezzin
sang
out
over
the
town
the
moslem
call
to
prayer
la
ilaha
ill
allah
mohammed
resoul
oullah
then
came
the
shrill
blast
of
a
trumpet
and
shushan
who
was
looking
at
the
troop
of
soldiers
nearest
them
saw
them
deliberately
open
their
ranks
and
allow
the
mob
behind
to
pass
with
them
into
the
armenian
quarter
all
the
family
rushed
down
again
from
the
roof
selferian
barred
the
door
and
his
wife
drew
the
shutters
across
the
windows
the
children
began
to
cry
with
terror
though
except
krikor
they
scarcely
knew
what
they
feared
selferian
aged
mother
was
there
also
weeping
and
wringing
her
hands
soon
the
sound
of
shots
the
noise
of
hurrying
feet
outside
and
the
shrieks
and
cries
that
filled
the
air
told
that
the
killing
had
begun
how
is
it
with
men
and
women
and
little
children
in
these
dire
extremities
thank
god
that
we
do
not
know
that
we
are
never
likely
to
know
oh
god
do
not
let
them
kill
us
children
sobbed
in
their
terror
oh
god
only
let
them
kill
us
at
once
men
and
women
prayed
their
lips
white
with
a
deadlier
fear
it
was
deliberate
organized
wholesale
murder
first
came
the
soldiers
zaptiehs
redifs
hamidiehs
then
the
turks
of
all
classes
especially
the
lowest
well
furnished
with
guns
and
knives
their
little
boys
ran
before
them
as
scouts
to
unearth
their
prey
here
father
here
another
giaour
they
would
cry
espying
some
unhappy
armenian
in
an
unused
well
or
behind
a
door
then
the
moslem
perhaps
would
put
his
knife
or
his
dagger
into
the
hands
of
his
little
son
and
hold
fast
the
giaour
till
the
child
had
dealt
the
death
blow
winning
thus
for
all
his
future
life
the
honourable
title
of
after
the
murderers
came
the
plunderers
a
miscellaneous
rabble
who
took
away
what
they
could
and
destroyed
the
rest
they
would
heap
the
provisions
together
in
the
midst
of
the
mix
them
with
wood
and
coal
and
other
combustibles
then
pour
kerosene
on
the
mass
and
set
it
on
fire
the
vartonians
the
meneshians
and
a
few
others
were
gathered
in
the
courtyard
of
the
large
vartonian
house
the
two
families
were
all
there
except
baron
vartonian
who
was
still
in
aleppo
old
hohannes
meneshian
who
happened
to
be
visiting
some
friends
kevork
who
had
gone
in
search
of
him
and
shushan
they
clung
together
the
women
and
children
weeping
the
men
for
the
most
part
silent
in
their
terror
above
the
sorrowful
crowd
rose
a
voice
that
said
let
us
die
praying
immediately
all
knelt
down
and
their
hearts
went
up
to
heaven
in
that
last
prayer
which
was
the
cry
of
their
despair
but
the
voice
of
a
hope
that
even
then
could
pierce
beyond
the
grave
thus
the
murderers
found
them
when
they
burst
in
the
gate
even
in
their
madness
the
sight
arrested
them
for
one
moment
so
the
giaours
prayed
then
let
them
pray
to
allah
and
acknowledge
his
prophet
and
they
might
be
allowed
to
live
cries
were
heard
say
ilaha
ill
allah
no
you
need
not
speak
only
lift
up
one
finger
we
will
take
it
for
brave
answers
rang
through
that
place
of
death
i
will
not
lift
up
one
finger
i
will
not
become
a
moslem
i
believe
in
god
the
father
almighty
maker
of
heaven
and
earth
and
in
jesus
christ
ere
the
confessor
could
complete
the
sentence
he
stood
in
the
presence
of
him
in
whom
he
believed
boghos
and
mariam
meneshian
died
in
each
other
arms
slain
almost
by
one
stroke
nor
did
mariam
greatly
care
to
live
for
she
had
seen
hagop
her
youngest
born
slain
first
clinging
in
vain
to
his
father
gabriel
remained
and
something
in
the
boy
look
and
attitude
seemed
to
touch
the
moslems
they
made
a
special
effort
to
save
him
only
acknowledge
the
prophet
only
lift
up
your
finger
they
said
the
boy
stood
erect
before
them
and
looked
at
them
fearlessly
face
to
face
am
i
better
than
my
father
whom
you
have
killed
am
i
better
than
my
mother
whom
you
have
killed
and
who
taught
me
the
way
of
holiness
no
i
will
become
a
moslem
and
deny
my
lord
and
saviour
christ
and
he
tore
his
clothing
open
to
receive
the
death
blow
they
were
angry
enough
now
far
too
angry
to
kill
him
at
once
blows
and
cuts
rained
on
him
till
at
last
he
fell
at
their
feet
bleeding
from
one
and
twenty
cruel
wounds
it
is
enough
we
can
look
no
farther
they
had
heaped
high
the
piles
of
dead
reads
well
in
song
and
story
and
it
is
not
too
horrible
to
think
of
when
brave
men
fall
in
equal
fight
but
those
slain
lying
in
their
blood
with
their
faces
raised
to
the
wintry
sky
it
is
best
for
us
not
to
see
them
not
now
it
may
be
we
shall
see
them
one
day
when
those
who
were
slain
for
the
word
of
god
and
the
testimony
of
jesus
christ
have
part
in
the
first
resurrection
in
the
large
courtyard
of
another
house
near
by
there
were
many
men
together
the
women
of
their
families
were
gathered
for
the
most
part
in
a
great
room
looking
out
on
the
court
the
men
were
trying
to
conceal
themselves
some
in
a
disused
well
some
on
the
roof
some
within
the
house
one
man
however
made
no
effort
to
escape
he
stood
calmly
at
the
top
of
the
flight
of
steps
which
led
to
the
room
where
the
women
were
it
was
stepanian
the
pastor
by
his
advice
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
was
left
open
that
the
turks
might
see
they
had
no
thought
of
resistance
the
howling
shouting
mob
came
near
and
nearer
still
they
poured
in
through
the
open
gate
and
being
men
of
the
town
at
once
they
recognised
the
pastor
here
is
stepanian
let
us
make
an
end
of
him
was
the
cry
fellow
townsmen
you
ought
to
spare
us
he
said
for
we
have
done
you
no
wrong
we
are
unarmed
and
defenceless
our
little
ones
depend
upon
us
and
will
be
left
to
starve
down
with
him
cried
the
mob
it
is
the
will
of
allah
preach
us
a
sermon
first
added
a
mocking
voice
in
the
crowd
do
not
touch
me
here
i
will
come
out
to
you
said
the
pastor
calmly
and
began
to
descend
the
steps
but
ere
he
reached
the
last
a
shot
went
through
his
breast
and
he
fell
no
sound
was
heard
and
no
blood
was
seen
elmas
standing
at
the
window
had
witnessed
all
strong
in
her
great
love
that
frail
girl
went
out
amongst
the
murderous
crowd
knelt
down
beside
her
father
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
forehead
he
opened
his
eyes
looked
up
at
her
and
smiled
father
she
prayed
father
speak
to
me
only
once
only
one
word
more
that
word
was
given
to
him
and
to
her
fear
not
the
lord
is
with
you
i
have
no
fear
for
i
am
going
to
my
dear
saviour
again
he
closed
his
eyes
and
in
another
moment
without
struggle
or
suffering
he
saw
him
face
to
face
she
sat
there
in
her
grief
and
all
the
world
was
dark
blank
the
words
are
her
own
she
seemed
to
have
no
consciousness
of
the
terrors
all
around
her
the
first
sound
that
touched
her
broken
heart
was
the
wailing
of
her
little
brother
a
babe
of
three
who
wanted
father
he
had
followed
her
down
the
steps
she
took
him
in
her
arms
and
held
him
up
that
he
might
see
his
sobs
grew
still
at
once
father
is
asleep
he
said
so
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
could
they
but
have
all
lain
down
by
his
side
and
slept
but
their
rest
was
yet
to
be
won
more
moslems
crowded
into
the
yard
slaying
all
the
men
they
could
discover
then
they
seized
the
women
the
girls
and
the
children
tore
off
their
clothing
and
their
jewels
and
drove
them
in
their
midst
as
a
flock
of
frightened
sheep
and
lambs
are
driven
to
the
slaughter
the
last
thing
elmas
ever
saw
of
that
beloved
form
on
the
ground
was
that
some
moslem
had
brought
a
mule
upon
which
he
seemed
about
to
place
it
she
was
dragged
from
her
dead
father
to
the
unutterable
horror
that
followed
oh
that
endless
walk
with
bare
bleeding
feet
through
the
streets
oh
the
clinging
hands
the
terrified
faces
the
piteous
sobs
and
wailing
of
the
children
thus
the
crowd
of
women
and
girls
almost
without
clothing
were
paraded
through
the
town
between
files
of
brutal
soldiers
and
every
now
and
then
some
of
them
seized
and
dragged
away
in
spite
of
their
shrieks
and
cries
vartan
pushed
his
way
to
his
sister
and
whispered
do
not
fear
elmas
i
have
the
knife
my
father
gave
me
hid
in
my
zeboun
it
will
do
to
kill
you
that
was
all
elmas
remembered
afterwards
with
any
clearness
that
and
the
clinging
of
her
baby
brother
arms
about
her
neck
at
last
they
came
to
streets
that
had
no
stain
of
blood
over
which
no
storm
of
agony
had
passed
they
were
in
the
moslem
quarter
on
and
on
they
went
until
they
reached
the
destined
place
one
of
the
great
mosques
of
the
city
the
kusseljohme
mosque
the
iron
gates
swung
open
to
receive
them
and
closed
again
on
that
mass
of
helpless
misery
shutting
out
all
mercy
save
the
mercy
of
god
chapter
xviii
evil
tidings
it
is
not
in
the
shipwreck
or
the
strife
we
feel
benumbed
and
wish
to
be
no
more
but
in
the
on
the
shore
when
all
is
lost
except
a
little
life
john
grayson
sat
alone
in
his
prison
room
it
was
a
very
different
prison
from
the
two
he
had
known
before
a
room
of
convenient
size
fairly
clean
with
a
divan
along
one
side
under
the
grated
windows
a
mattress
to
sleep
on
a
rug
and
several
cushions
a
comfortable
meal
almost
untouched
however
lay
near
him
on
a
stool
moreover
he
had
been
permitted
a
bath
and
allowed
to
purchase
clothing
anything
he
wished
he
had
chosen
to
have
an
ordinary
jacket
and
zeboun
and
a
crimson
fez
he
sat
on
the
divan
in
an
attitude
of
deepest
dejection
his
face
covered
with
his
hands
continually
the
scenes
of
four
days
ago
were
passing
through
his
mind
and
before
his
eyes
he
saw
them
all
again
he
thought
he
should
see
them
always
till
his
life
end
the
band
of
confessors
were
led
out
of
prison
they
stood
before
the
turkish
kadi
a
single
question
was
put
to
them
would
they
become
moslems
or
would
they
not
thomassian
in
every
way
the
foremost
man
amongst
them
answered
for
the
rest
we
follow
christ
we
are
ready
to
die
for
him
with
one
voice
all
signified
their
assent
the
executioner
began
with
dikran
the
youngest
john
grayson
veiled
his
face
but
not
till
he
had
seen
too
much
could
he
ever
cease
to
see
it
a
deadly
faintness
swept
over
him
from
which
he
was
roused
by
thomassian
brave
words
of
comfort
and
encouragement
spoken
to
the
victim
dear
boy
be
strong
it
will
soon
be
over
you
will
soon
be
with
christ
then
came
the
poor
lad
own
murmured
words
of
confession
and
of
prayer
ending
at
last
with
one
strong
joyful
praise
to
jesus
christ
john
grayson
looked
up
again
it
was
time
he
was
wanted
now
his
turn
had
come
at
that
supreme
moment
faintness
and
sickness
and
every
trace
of
fear
passed
from
him
one
thought
possessed
him
wholly
was
yet
he
could
have
shaken
like
a
leaf
at
thomassian
sudden
call
to
the
executioners
hold
i
have
something
to
say
martyrdom
could
be
borne
but
the
moments
of
suspense
that
followed
seemed
the
most
unbearable
he
had
ever
lived
through
he
heard
thomassian
protesting
it
will
be
on
your
peril
if
you
touch
this
man
he
is
an
englishman
i
know
it
he
can
prove
it
if
you
give
him
time
which
for
your
own
sakes
you
ought
to
do
jack
might
have
said
this
himself
till
he
was
hoarse
and
the
turks
in
their
present
state
of
frantic
excitement
would
not
have
listened
to
still
less
have
believed
him
it
was
different
when
a
man
of
mark
a
notable
like
thomassian
averred
it
solemnly
and
at
the
point
of
death
their
orders
not
to
kill
foreigners
were
precise
and
stringent
and
hitherto
had
been
wonderfully
well
obeyed
there
might
be
trouble
if
they
were
transgressed
jack
was
informed
that
it
was
not
the
will
of
allah
he
should
die
that
day
and
to
his
sorrow
was
led
away
without
seeing
what
became
of
his
fellow
captives
he
was
transferred
that
evening
to
a
comfortable
room
and
told
he
might
order
any
conveniences
he
desired
and
could
afford
he
begged
to
be
told
the
fate
of
his
friends
and
was
informed
that
several
of
them
had
died
with
unparalleled
obstinacy
the
rest
were
reserved
for
another
time
was
baron
thomassian
amongst
the
dead
no
said
his
informant
with
an
evil
smile
he
was
much
the
worst
and
should
stay
till
the
last
as
for
himself
what
were
they
going
to
do
with
him
let
the
effendi
give
himself
no
uneasiness
on
that
score
his
highness
the
pasha
had
been
informed
of
the
circumstances
and
would
take
care
of
him
probably
he
would
send
him
under
a
safe
escort
out
of
the
country
but
nothing
could
be
done
until
order
was
restored
and
the
town
quiet
let
the
effendi
be
patient
and
put
his
trust
in
allah
the
effendi
knew
things
had
to
go
jack
was
very
miserable
how
could
he
take
pleasure
in
the
comfort
of
his
surroundings
when
he
knew
what
his
friends
had
suffered
and
were
suffering
only
for
shushan
he
would
not
have
cared
at
all
to
live
he
asked
if
miss
celandine
was
gone
no
not
yet
there
was
some
delay
about
her
passport
his
informant
thought
but
no
doubt
all
would
be
ready
soon
and
she
would
go
would
the
effendi
like
to
take
exercise
in
the
prison
court
if
so
he
was
quite
at
liberty
no
one
wished
the
effendi
to
be
incommoded
it
was
entirely
for
his
own
safety
he
was
placed
under
restraint
until
the
rebellion
amongst
the
armenians
should
be
put
down
two
long
slow
days
thursday
and
friday
wore
on
on
saturday
morning
he
was
aware
of
some
unusual
excitement
in
the
court
of
the
prison
the
prisoners
there
who
were
all
moslems
hung
together
in
groups
talking
eagerly
and
more
than
once
a
word
reached
his
ears
about
killing
the
giaours
moreover
he
heard
shouts
and
cries
from
outside
increasing
gradually
until
the
uproar
became
terrible
the
extraordinary
sound
of
the
zilghit
reached
his
ears
but
he
could
not
understand
it
the
guards
who
brought
him
his
food
shared
in
the
general
excitement
and
exhilaration
after
returning
their
salaams
he
said
casually
it
is
a
fine
day
to
which
one
of
them
answered
it
will
be
a
bad
one
for
the
giaours
and
the
other
added
it
will
be
wet
in
the
armenian
quarter
but
the
rain
will
be
red
he
entreated
them
to
tell
him
more
but
they
would
not
evidently
they
had
their
orders
did
the
effendi
want
anything
more
no
then
peace
be
with
him
they
departed
securing
the
door
behind
them
as
he
thought
with
unusual
care
peace
was
with
him
instead
of
it
a
fierce
tumult
raged
in
his
heart
on
that
strange
christmas
morning
when
he
thought
himself
about
to
die
for
the
name
of
christ
there
had
been
a
calm
over
him
which
was
wonderful
mysterious
even
to
himself
the
conflict
was
not
his
but
god
god
had
called
him
to
it
and
would
bring
him
through
he
was
very
near
him
and
would
be
with
him
even
to
the
end
but
the
chariots
and
horses
of
fire
which
the
prophet
of
old
saw
about
him
did
not
stay
when
the
hostile
hosts
departed
the
resplendent
vision
vanished
too
martyrdom
at
a
distance
martyr
strength
seems
at
a
distance
also
sometimes
it
even
seems
unimaginable
patient
powerless
waiting
is
often
harder
than
heroic
doing
or
suffering
perhaps
the
hardest
thing
of
all
is
to
be
brave
and
strong
when
they
have
the
peril
and
the
suffering
and
we
the
bitter
comfort
of
compulsory
safety
but
the
longest
day
must
end
at
last
evening
brought
to
john
grayson
the
doubtful
pleasure
of
a
companion
in
misfortune
this
was
a
handsome
young
turk
who
seemed
much
amazed
and
still
more
annoyed
at
the
predicament
in
which
he
found
himself
paying
little
heed
to
his
companion
he
walked
up
and
down
cursing
certain
persons
apparently
his
own
kinsfolk
in
the
name
of
allah
and
the
prophet
with
true
eastern
volubility
in
one
of
these
perambulations
he
accidentally
kicked
over
jack
tray
of
food
and
stopped
to
ask
his
pardon
very
politely
of
course
in
turkish
i
think
he
said
looking
at
him
attentively
i
think
you
are
a
christian
yes
said
jack
in
fact
i
am
an
englishman
though
i
have
been
in
this
country
for
some
years
oh
then
i
suppose
you
are
the
grayson
i
have
heard
my
friends
speak
of
jack
bowed
then
added
immediately
i
am
unutterably
anxious
about
dear
friends
of
mine
who
are
in
the
armenian
quarter
can
you
tell
me
how
it
has
been
with
them
the
young
man
turned
his
face
away
and
did
not
speak
for
god
sake
say
jack
cried
say
only
tell
me
all
it
was
the
will
of
allah
said
the
turk
have
you
killed
them
jack
gasped
out
yes
a
great
many
chiefly
men
and
boys
but
i
did
not
see
the
end
that
uncle
of
mine
allah
give
him
his
deserts
had
me
taken
up
and
clapped
in
here
what
for
killing
our
people
the
turk
stared
that
were
merit
he
said
no
what
i
did
was
to
resist
a
soldier
a
hamidieh
in
fact
i
struck
him
but
what
would
you
have
a
man
must
have
friends
he
sat
down
and
taking
out
his
tobacco
pouch
began
leisurely
to
make
cigarettes
apparently
with
the
purpose
of
restoring
his
calmness
imperilled
by
the
thought
of
his
wrongs
the
matter
was
this
he
resumed
i
passed
by
a
long
row
of
giaours
fine
young
men
lying
on
the
ground
with
their
throats
cut
in
one
of
them
i
recognised
a
friend
and
looking
closer
saw
he
was
not
dead
for
the
work
had
been
very
ill
done
just
then
this
hamidieh
came
by
and
wanted
to
finish
him
like
a
fool
instead
of
giving
him
a
couple
of
medjids
i
gave
him
the
butt
end
of
my
gun
i
took
my
friend
to
my
house
and
thought
no
more
of
it
but
by
the
beard
of
the
prophet
what
did
that
rascal
do
but
go
and
complain
to
his
captain
who
knows
my
uncle
and
must
needs
go
to
him
then
my
uncle
informs
against
me
and
has
me
put
in
here
to
keep
me
out
of
mischief
as
he
says
curse
his
mother
and
his
grandmother
and
his
wife
and
his
daughters
and
all
his
relations
male
and
female
unto
the
fourth
and
fifth
generations
apparently
the
turk
forgot
that
amongst
these
relations
he
was
cursing
himself
jack
listened
in
horror
only
tell
me
who
are
slain
he
said
how
many
how
should
i
tell
that
i
could
only
see
what
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
do
you
know
aught
of
the
meneshians
or
of
the
vartonians
yes
i
fear
that
all
of
both
families
are
killed
with
perhaps
one
exception
he
added
slowly
stroking
his
beard
i
saw
the
mob
burst
into
their
courtyard
oh
god
it
is
horrible
jack
said
with
a
groan
and
covering
his
face
after
a
while
he
spoke
again
the
stepanians
of
them
i
know
more
with
my
own
hand
i
shot
the
pastor
jack
sprang
on
him
his
eyes
blazing
his
hand
at
his
throat
he
had
nearly
been
a
martyr
but
he
was
an
englishman
and
a
very
human
englishman
too
let
be
the
turk
gasped
cool
though
choking
a
moment
if
you
please
jack
loosened
his
hold
you
can
strangle
me
of
course
if
such
be
the
will
of
allah
the
turk
continued
but
you
may
as
well
hear
me
first
for
if
you
get
free
you
can
tell
your
people
the
words
of
osman
are
you
then
the
turk
i
have
heard
the
pastor
speak
of
so
kindly
that
you
should
sit
there
before
me
and
tell
me
you
have
killed
him
him
how
could
you
ca
you
understand
the
turk
returned
with
an
expressive
look
there
were
his
daughter
and
all
his
children
looking
on
his
last
thought
was
for
them
not
touch
me
he
said
was
i
going
to
let
them
see
him
cut
to
pieces
at
least
i
could
save
him
and
them
from
he
had
not
a
moment
pain
jack
stretched
out
his
hand
to
him
impulsively
but
drew
it
back
again
i
can
not
touch
your
hand
he
said
but
i
can
say
from
my
heart
god
bless
you
the
turk
went
on
i
could
save
the
dead
from
insult
and
i
did
i
wanted
to
save
the
children
too
and
might
have
managed
it
but
for
my
fool
of
an
uncle
is
miss
celandine
are
the
people
with
her
in
the
mission
house
all
safe
jack
enquired
he
had
little
doubt
of
it
yet
he
could
not
help
the
beating
of
his
heart
oh
yes
they
have
a
special
guard
of
zaptiehs
only
an
hour
before
the
killing
began
the
pasha
sent
to
miss
celandine
to
say
that
now
she
might
leave
the
city
everything
was
safe
and
quiet
but
she
has
not
gone
perhaps
she
thought
she
could
help
the
other
giaours
by
staying
that
however
she
can
not
do
even
her
own
people
are
not
safe
beyond
the
mission
premises
a
young
lady
in
her
charge
had
gone
into
the
town
with
a
guard
of
zaptiehs
to
see
her
dying
father
at
the
house
of
one
selferian
she
never
returned
mehmed
ibrahim
who
has
long
wanted
her
for
his
harem
took
care
of
that
in
fact
i
believe
the
summons
to
her
father
was
a
pretence
and
the
whole
thing
a
plot
of
his
i
saw
them
leading
her
away
with
a
cry
of
agony
john
grayson
fell
senseless
on
the
floor
the
turk
sat
gazing
at
him
without
stirring
hand
or
foot
to
use
any
means
for
his
restoration
was
the
last
thing
he
would
have
thought
of
allah
had
stricken
him
and
allah
would
restore
his
senses
when
he
pleased
a
logical
western
might
ask
why
he
did
not
reason
thus
in
the
case
of
his
armenian
friend
or
of
the
pastor
and
his
family
but
a
man
heart
may
be
sometimes
better
than
his
logic
jack
at
last
recovered
consciousness
and
struggled
to
his
feet
osman
did
not
know
the
story
of
his
marriage
but
he
drew
his
own
conclusions
from
what
he
saw
how
hard
you
franks
take
things
he
remarked
by
way
of
consolation
now
there
are
in
the
world
a
great
many
girls
any
of
whom
a
man
can
marry
if
he
pleases
do
jack
said
hoarsely
my
dear
fellow
the
turk
went
on
kindly
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
see
the
advantage
it
would
be
to
you
now
if
you
were
only
a
true
believer
we
lose
a
wife
and
we
are
very
sorry
oh
yes
but
then
you
see
we
have
so
many
it
is
only
just
like
losing
a
cow
there
are
others
quite
as
good
jack
fortunately
did
not
hear
a
word
of
this
he
stood
as
one
bewildered
then
made
a
sudden
rush
to
the
door
which
he
pulled
and
shook
with
all
his
might
what
are
you
doing
asked
the
turk
serenely
i
must
get
out
cried
jack
i
must
get
out
and
save
her
you
can
not
save
her
she
could
not
be
more
out
of
your
reach
if
she
were
up
there
in
yonder
sky
take
my
advice
and
be
quiet
it
is
the
will
of
allah
i
must
get
out
jack
shouted
once
more
shaking
at
the
door
you
had
much
better
stay
where
you
are
if
you
were
out
you
would
do
something
rash
and
bring
trouble
on
yourself
on
jack
repeated
in
a
voice
of
despair
for
myself
there
is
no
trouble
any
more
i
could
tell
you
how
you
might
get
out
if
it
were
really
good
for
you
osman
mused
but
the
truth
is
i
do
not
want
more
of
you
to
be
killed
i
am
sick
of
all
this
misery
and
bloodshed
osman
effendi
i
think
you
have
a
kind
and
pitying
heart
therefore
i
pray
you
to
help
me
now
and
so
may
god
help
you
if
you
ever
come
to
a
bitter
hour
like
this
i
must
get
out
or
i
shall
go
mad
i
wish
i
could
do
you
a
better
service
but
if
you
will
try
it
wait
until
the
morning
light
then
the
killing
will
begin
again
they
are
going
to
let
the
moslem
prisoners
out
that
they
may
take
part
in
it
and
thus
deserve
their
pardon
from
god
and
the
sultan
tell
the
jailor
when
he
comes
to
us
that
you
want
to
walk
in
the
courtyard
that
he
will
allow
once
there
you
may
be
able
to
slip
out
unnoticed
among
the
rest
take
my
scarlet
fez
instead
of
your
crimson
one
and
see
here
is
a
green
kerchief
to
tie
over
it
the
fez
i
take
and
thank
you
the
kerchief
no
as
you
please
i
wish
you
well
grayson
effendi
and
if
i
can
help
you
in
anything
i
will
should
you
want
a
refuge
come
to
my
house
you
know
where
it
is
in
fact
that
is
the
best
thing
you
could
do
he
added
my
people
will
make
it
known
you
are
an
englishman
and
then
no
one
will
even
wish
to
hurt
you
there
will
be
a
mark
set
upon
you
as
it
were
ay
cried
jack
wildly
the
mark
of
cain
any
finding
him
should
kill
him
to
save
my
own
miserable
life
and
see
all
i
love
perish
around
me
is
what
it
means
the
mark
of
cain
he
saved
himself
others
he
did
not
save
i
do
not
understand
you
how
should
you
i
do
understand
myself
i
think
i
am
going
mad
only
i
know
it
was
not
mark
which
was
put
upon
her
forehead
and
mine
it
was
the
cross
of
christ
and
that
means
just
the
contrary
saved
others
himself
he
did
not
save
the
young
turk
took
the
cigarette
from
his
lips
and
stared
at
him
wondering
into
his
hard
black
eyes
there
came
for
an
instant
a
perplexed
wistful
look
like
that
of
a
dumb
creature
who
longs
and
tries
to
understand
but
can
not
pass
the
limitations
of
his
being
at
length
he
said
in
a
softened
voice
when
i
get
out
of
this
cursed
place
with
the
help
of
allah
and
a
handful
of
good
medjids
i
will
try
to
do
what
i
can
to
help
your
people
but
now
it
is
the
hour
of
prayer
i
will
pray
and
then
try
to
sleep
grayson
effendi
you
ought
to
pray
too
it
may
be
allah
the
merciful
will
hear
you
though
you
do
not
acknowledge
his
prophet
he
may
remember
you
are
a
frank
and
make
allowance
for
john
grayson
there
was
no
prayer
that
night
his
anguish
was
beyond
words
and
as
for
tears
their
very
fount
seemed
dried
up
within
him
even
the
simplest
cry
to
god
for
help
seemed
to
freeze
upon
his
lips
where
was
the
use
of
it
he
had
prayed
with
all
his
soul
and
god
had
heard
how
that
long
night
passed
how
he
watched
and
waited
for
the
morning
none
would
ever
know
the
morning
light
came
at
last
though
it
brought
no
joy
with
it
he
continued
however
to
hold
off
the
anguish
of
his
soul
as
it
were
at
arm
length
while
he
made
himself
carefully
up
to
look
as
like
a
moslem
as
possible
though
avoiding
the
green
for
conscience
sake
assuming
a
tone
of
indifference
he
made
his
request
of
the
jailor
who
with
his
mind
running
on
killing
giaours
muttered
a
careless
assent
for
a
good
while
he
lingered
about
the
court
joining
one
group
or
another
so
as
to
avoid
suspicion
at
last
the
prison
gate
was
opened
and
lost
amidst
a
crowd
of
moslem
criminals
who
were
rushing
out
with
tumultuous
joy
to
earn
at
the
same
time
paradise
and
pardon
by
killing
giaours
john
grayson
made
his
way
into
the
street
chapter
xix
a
great
crime
consummated
god
spirit
sweet
still
thou
the
heat
of
our
passionate
hearts
when
they
rave
and
beat
quiet
their
swell
and
gently
tell
that
his
right
hand
doeth
all
things
well
tell
us
that
he
who
erst
with
the
three
walked
also
with
these
in
their
agony
and
drew
them
higher
and
rapt
them
nigher
to
heaven
whose
chariot
and
horses
are
fire
dread
were
the
watches
of
that
december
night
amidst
the
unutterable
agonies
of
half
a
city
in
the
armenian
quarter
the
only
sleepers
were
those
thrice
happy
who
would
never
awake
again
until
the
heavens
be
no
more
they
were
very
many
like
the
slain
in
some
great
battle
that
decides
a
nation
destiny
they
lay
in
heaps
in
the
open
street
in
the
in
the
houses
tearless
women
strong
in
the
strength
of
love
came
and
sought
their
own
amongst
them
sometimes
a
wife
who
found
her
husband
a
mother
who
embraced
her
son
wept
and
wailed
and
made
sore
lamentation
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
still
enough
sometimes
they
thanked
god
that
they
had
found
them
it
went
worse
with
those
who
sat
in
their
desolate
homes
and
watched
the
slow
ebbing
often
in
cruel
anguish
of
the
lives
they
loved
the
number
of
the
wounded
and
the
dying
was
enormous
for
one
thing
the
murderers
were
unskilful
for
another
they
were
often
deliberately
cruel
moreover
it
was
better
economy
to
hack
a
giaour
to
pieces
with
swords
or
knives
than
to
shoot
him
since
every
bullet
cost
two
piastres
it
went
worse
still
with
the
women
the
girls
the
little
children
even
who
were
dragged
to
the
mosques
and
shut
up
there
in
hunger
cold
and
misery
until
the
murderers
of
their
fathers
their
husbands
and
brothers
had
leisure
to
come
and
take
them
and
work
their
will
upon
them
oh
god
of
mercy
and
pity
that
these
things
should
be
in
this
world
of
thine
had
he
quite
forsaken
urfa
not
always
standing
outside
the
furnace
can
we
see
therein
the
form
of
one
like
unto
the
son
of
god
the
men
know
better
that
night
in
the
vast
gregorian
cathedral
a
great
congregation
met
many
no
doubt
came
there
as
to
a
place
of
refuge
hoping
that
even
moslems
would
respect
that
sacred
spot
but
many
more
came
to
worship
perhaps
for
the
last
time
in
the
courts
of
god
upon
earth
a
band
of
heroic
gregorian
priests
men
who
were
ready
to
be
offered
and
who
knew
that
the
time
of
their
departure
was
at
hand
made
of
this
last
service
a
solemn
and
sacred
feast
they
showed
forth
the
death
of
their
lord
giving
the
bread
and
the
wine
which
he
ordained
for
all
time
as
its
hallowed
memorials
to
the
kneeling
multitude
men
and
women
and
little
children
thinking
thus
upon
his
death
for
them
were
strengthened
to
meet
death
for
him
in
faith
and
patience
on
one
of
the
pillars
of
that
church
now
in
ruins
some
hand
now
cold
in
death
has
traced
the
record
that
eighteen
hundred
persons
partook
of
that
solemn
sacrament
never
again
should
they
eat
of
that
bread
or
drink
of
that
cup
until
the
trump
of
god
be
heard
until
the
ancient
graves
be
stirred
and
with
the
great
commanding
word
the
lord
shall
come
for
those
still
left
in
the
doomed
city
that
seemed
indeed
the
last
trumpet
which
sounded
in
the
early
dawn
of
sunday
the
of
december
it
sent
a
thrill
of
horror
through
every
armenian
heart
they
knew
it
was
the
signal
for
resuming
the
massacre
and
completing
the
work
of
death
and
ruin
left
unfinished
the
previous
day
an
orgie
of
blood
and
crime
worse
than
all
that
had
gone
before
began
then
many
moslems
of
the
lowest
class
who
had
hitherto
been
kept
in
check
by
the
fear
that
the
christians
might
defend
themselves
now
joined
the
murderers
moreover
all
passions
are
blunted
by
indulgence
and
require
stronger
and
yet
stronger
stimulants
the
passion
of
cruelty
is
no
exception
where
it
really
exists
where
men
kill
and
torture
not
for
rage
or
hate
or
greed
or
fear
but
for
the
joy
they
have
in
doing
it
it
is
as
a
demon
possessing
the
soul
it
lives
it
grows
it
thirsts
it
craves
sacrifices
ever
greater
and
more
ingenious
it
develops
a
horrible
a
satanic
subtlety
it
inspires
deeds
at
the
mere
recital
of
which
humanity
shudders
we
may
not
tell
we
may
not
even
think
of
them
involuntarily
we
close
our
eyes
we
stop
our
ears
but
ought
we
not
sometimes
to
remember
that
our
brothers
and
our
sisters
have
them
all
hanum
selferian
was
sitting
in
what
had
been
only
yesterday
the
best
room
of
her
comfortable
home
now
not
a
single
article
of
furniture
remained
unbroken
or
unspoiled
curtains
were
torn
down
presses
were
smashed
open
and
their
contents
either
taken
away
broken
into
fragments
or
strewn
about
in
the
midst
of
the
floor
lay
all
the
food
in
the
house
bulghour
rice
meal
coffee
vegetables
bread
tossed
together
in
a
confused
heap
over
which
charcoal
had
been
thrown
and
kerosene
poured
but
no
eyes
for
this
or
for
aught
else
had
the
wife
on
a
bed
in
the
corner
lay
her
husband
dying
he
was
horribly
mutilated
but
the
hand
of
devoted
love
had
bound
up
the
fearful
wounds
and
done
the
little
that
was
possible
to
assuage
their
anguish
all
the
long
night
she
had
watched
beside
him
her
children
clinging
round
her
weeping
and
praying
the
elder
ones
trying
to
help
her
when
they
could
no
joy
came
in
the
morning
but
a
new
and
terrible
fear
what
if
the
turks
should
return
flight
and
concealment
were
out
of
the
question
the
gate
of
their
courtyard
was
broken
the
day
before
and
now
some
one
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
room
where
they
were
hanum
selferian
started
to
her
feet
a
man
stood
before
her
his
eyes
wild
and
bloodshot
his
face
stamped
with
an
expression
of
unutterable
horror
one
short
hour
had
passed
since
john
grayson
went
forth
from
the
gate
of
the
prison
in
that
time
he
had
seen
things
which
he
never
afterwards
told
to
any
one
and
which
he
would
have
given
a
king
ransom
for
the
power
of
forgetting
now
like
one
walking
in
a
dream
seeing
nothing
hearing
nothing
he
strode
up
to
her
and
asked
where
is
my
wife
hanum
selferian
had
seen
him
often
and
knew
all
about
him
but
how
could
she
recognise
in
this
broken
man
the
bright
fearless
english
youth
he
looked
full
fifty
years
of
age
besides
her
own
sorrow
filled
her
heart
and
dulled
her
senses
speak
low
she
said
my
husband
i
am
sorry
jack
answered
mechanically
but
where
is
my
wife
shushan
meneshian
shushan
she
looked
up
now
her
thoughts
diverted
for
a
moment
you
are
not
the
englishman
would
i
were
no
one
will
kill
me
there
is
a
mark
set
upon
me
that
none
may
hurt
me
it
is
the
mark
of
where
is
my
wife
i
was
told
she
came
here
yes
to
see
her
father
boghos
who
was
not
here
at
all
it
was
all
a
trick
said
the
poor
woman
amaan
do
not
ask
me
more
do
cry
dear
effendi
broke
in
the
youngest
of
the
little
girls
taking
his
hand
caressingly
and
touching
it
with
her
forehead
mother
hid
me
in
the
storeroom
while
the
turks
were
here
but
i
looked
through
the
crack
of
the
door
and
saw
i
saw
dreadful
things
they
hurt
poor
father
oh
so
terribly
but
they
did
not
hurt
oriort
shushan
at
all
not
the
very
least
they
only
took
her
away
with
them
i
am
sure
they
will
be
very
kind
to
her
she
is
so
dear
and
beautiful
said
the
next
sister
just
a
little
older
krikor
the
eldest
boy
came
running
in
mother
mother
let
us
all
go
to
the
church
the
neighbours
those
of
them
who
are
say
it
is
the
best
thing
to
do
the
turks
will
not
touch
us
there
one
loving
glance
she
gave
to
her
dying
husband
then
she
looked
at
jack
perhaps
she
said
the
kind
english
effendi
would
take
you
children
there
and
your
grandmother
parooz
where
is
she
not
one
of
us
will
stir
a
step
without
you
mother
there
is
no
use
in
asking
us
we
live
or
die
all
together
the
boy
said
firmly
disregarding
the
looks
and
gestures
with
which
his
mother
tried
to
stop
him
then
a
feeble
voice
was
heard
speaking
from
the
bed
in
god
name
let
us
all
go
i
think
i
could
walk
with
help
in
john
grayson
broken
heart
the
instinct
of
helpfulness
survived
it
was
as
if
he
were
dead
within
and
his
shell
his
outer
self
went
on
mechanically
acting
out
the
impulses
impressed
and
the
habits
formed
during
his
i
will
help
you
he
said
going
over
to
the
wounded
man
and
preparing
to
raise
him
from
the
bed
almost
dying
as
he
was
he
was
still
able
to
stand
and
even
to
walk
a
little
parooz
the
eldest
girl
fetched
the
grandmother
who
had
gone
apart
to
weep
and
was
found
in
an
upper
room
sleeping
for
sorrow
the
children
gathered
round
them
jack
put
his
strong
arm
about
the
dying
man
his
wife
supported
him
on
the
other
side
and
they
all
went
out
together
the
state
of
the
streets
was
indescribable
people
were
rushing
through
them
wildly
shrieking
screaming
crying
for
help
and
the
dead
and
dying
lay
about
under
their
very
feet
happily
the
cathedral
was
near
at
hand
but
for
one
of
the
little
party
peace
and
safety
were
nearer
still
as
they
came
in
sight
of
it
selferian
strength
failed
let
me
rest
a
moment
he
prayed
they
put
down
some
of
their
upper
garments
and
laid
him
gently
on
them
and
there
he
rested
from
all
his
weariness
and
all
his
pain
there
was
no
time
to
mourn
the
dead
the
old
grandmother
went
on
first
taking
with
her
the
reluctant
krikor
then
jack
said
to
the
widow
for
your
children
sake
and
pointed
to
the
cathedral
the
sights
of
horror
they
had
seen
even
in
their
short
walk
quickened
their
footsteps
they
found
the
churchyard
and
the
buildings
around
it
the
dwellings
of
the
priests
and
the
already
full
of
people
making
their
way
through
the
throng
they
got
at
last
into
the
cathedral
and
after
some
further
delay
went
up
into
the
gallery
some
people
the
selferians
knew
being
there
already
jack
kept
with
them
his
behaviour
outwardly
was
quite
rational
but
he
had
entirely
lost
control
over
his
thoughts
once
he
imagined
he
was
back
again
in
england
wildly
imploring
the
queen
the
government
the
whole
nation
to
send
men
and
guns
and
bayonets
to
armenia
not
to
save
the
people
but
to
kill
them
to
kill
them
mercifully
all
at
once
and
make
an
end
of
this
agony
shushan
and
shushan
race
seemed
in
his
mind
to
have
blended
together
into
one
in
these
days
he
thought
men
seek
death
and
shall
not
find
it
and
shall
desire
to
die
and
death
shall
flee
from
them
all
this
time
there
were
people
pouring
in
filling
the
vast
spaces
of
the
church
till
scarce
standing
room
remained
at
last
the
great
iron
door
swung
to
and
was
shut
not
one
moment
too
soon
the
mob
was
already
thundering
at
it
the
yells
and
howls
of
the
frenzied
crowd
outside
mingled
with
the
cries
and
groans
of
the
terrified
crowd
within
at
the
same
time
shots
came
in
through
the
windows
wounding
some
and
killing
others
at
last
the
storm
prevailed
the
iron
door
smashed
in
and
then
the
work
of
murder
began
in
earnest
but
the
very
density
of
the
crowd
of
victims
checked
its
progress
it
was
hard
to
cut
through
that
mass
of
living
flesh
one
incident
jack
saw
which
stamped
itself
upon
his
mind
though
at
the
time
he
felt
neither
that
nor
anything
else
some
turk
mounted
on
a
bench
or
stone
saw
a
face
in
the
crowd
he
knew
that
of
a
young
armenian
singer
whose
sweet
voice
was
already
winning
him
gold
and
glory
and
who
was
a
special
favourite
with
the
moslems
he
and
others
called
to
him
by
name
the
youth
sprang
upon
a
pedestal
and
in
a
minor
key
with
a
voice
of
exquisite
pathos
and
melody
began
a
plaintive
armenian
song
then
a
strange
thing
was
seen
and
heard
there
were
tears
on
moslem
faces
and
sobs
that
broke
from
moslem
breasts
this
would
not
do
guns
were
pointed
at
the
too
successful
singer
stop
cried
the
voice
of
one
having
authority
dear
youth
be
a
moslem
we
will
save
you
alive
and
give
you
wealth
and
honour
as
much
as
you
will
the
dauntless
word
rang
through
the
church
sweeter
than
melody
of
harp
or
lute
sweeter
than
voice
of
song
it
was
the
young
singer
last
utterance
the
end
came
then
for
him
the
work
of
death
went
on
the
murderers
hewing
a
way
for
themselves
through
the
crowded
aisles
meanwhile
in
the
vast
gallery
which
ran
quite
round
the
building
the
terrified
multitude
mostly
women
and
children
shrieked
and
wept
and
prayed
calling
aloud
on
the
name
of
jesus
a
few
men
tried
to
climb
out
through
the
windows
but
this
was
impossible
and
would
have
been
useless
for
the
mob
were
waiting
outside
with
firearms
to
pick
off
the
fugitives
jack
stood
where
he
was
for
his
own
life
he
did
not
care
the
turning
of
a
straw
and
his
instinct
of
protection
kept
him
beside
the
selferians
he
saw
all
the
work
of
murder
going
on
in
the
church
below
and
now
the
moslems
had
reached
the
altar
some
of
them
sprang
upon
it
while
others
tore
the
pictures
smashed
the
woodwork
and
broke
open
anything
they
thought
might
contain
treasure
there
was
on
the
a
large
beautiful
and
very
ancient
bible
bound
and
clasped
with
silver
with
a
yell
of
triumph
a
moslem
seized
it
tore
out
the
leaves
and
flung
down
the
desecrated
volume
now
prophet
jesus
he
shouted
save
thine
own
if
thou
canst
show
thyself
stronger
than
mahomet
for
one
brief
moment
a
wild
ecstatic
hope
sprang
up
in
the
heart
of
john
grayson
he
looked
up
and
half
expected
the
solid
roof
to
open
revealing
god
heaven
above
them
and
in
it
the
sign
of
the
son
of
man
his
christian
lips
the
moslem
cry
save
thine
own
show
thyself
stronger
than
mahomet
there
was
no
voice
neither
any
that
answered
the
silence
of
the
ages
that
strange
mysterious
awful
silence
was
not
broken
it
lasted
as
it
lasts
still
in
the
brain
of
john
grayson
some
chord
snapped
then
there
is
no
christ
he
said
he
can
not
hear
us
he
is
dead
long
ago
there
is
no
god
he
is
nothing
but
a
dream
a
dream
of
happy
men
who
sit
at
ease
in
quiet
homes
he
did
not
know
that
he
spoke
aloud
but
a
woman
near
him
heard
the
words
how
can
you
say
there
is
no
god
she
remonstrated
it
is
not
true
but
has
gone
the
next
moment
a
shot
from
below
struck
the
speaker
and
she
fell
into
jack
very
arms
the
turks
were
firing
up
into
the
crowd
in
the
gallery
but
that
process
was
by
far
too
slow
now
they
were
dragging
mattrasses
rugs
clothing
light
wood
work
from
the
adjoining
priests
houses
and
piling
them
on
and
amongst
the
heaps
of
dead
and
dying
in
the
church
then
they
carried
in
great
vessels
of
kerosene
and
poured
their
contents
over
the
whole
mass
to
this
horrible
sacrifice
they
set
fire
in
several
places
the
flames
arose
the
crowd
in
the
gallery
saw
the
awful
fate
prepared
for
them
and
one
wild
wailing
shriek
of
terror
drowned
every
other
noise
turks
meanwhile
were
rushing
up
the
gallery
stairs
seizing
the
younger
women
and
girls
and
carrying
them
out
a
turk
forced
his
way
between
jack
and
hanum
selferian
do
you
know
me
he
asked
her
i
killed
your
husband
yesterday
because
i
want
to
marry
you
come
with
me
and
i
will
save
you
and
your
children
he
seized
her
zeboun
but
with
an
effort
she
freed
herself
from
his
grasp
jack
helping
her
and
the
children
keeping
close
to
her
they
pushed
on
to
the
front
of
the
gallery
and
looked
down
a
sea
of
fire
was
beneath
them
its
hot
breath
scorched
their
faces
the
turk
was
following
them
then
the
armenian
mother
lifted
her
youngest
child
a
boy
of
eight
in
her
arms
and
looked
at
the
three
little
girls
clinging
to
her
side
children
she
said
will
you
go
with
that
man
and
be
moslems
or
will
you
die
for
christ
with
me
mother
we
will
die
with
you
said
the
little
voices
speaking
all
at
once
she
could
do
for
them
one
thing
yet
they
should
not
suffer
in
another
moment
they
should
be
with
christ
twenty
feet
down
right
into
the
heart
of
the
hottest
fire
she
flung
her
youngest
child
then
followed
the
little
girls
and
then
just
as
the
turk
hand
touched
her
shoulder
her
own
rest
was
won
that
was
the
last
thing
jack
saw
in
the
burning
church
oh
christ
who
that
day
didst
keep
silence
in
thy
heaven
help
us
to
remember
that
other
day
when
around
thy
cross
the
mocking
voices
sounded
if
thou
be
the
christ
save
thyself
and
thou
wert
silent
too
help
us
to
hold
fast
by
that
faith
in
thee
that
lies
between
us
and
madness
make
us
understand
that
these
thy
people
are
indeed
members
incorporate
in
thy
mystical
body
not
them
alone
through
sympathy
but
them
through
vital
organic
union
thou
sufferest
still
in
them
thou
art
in
thine
agony
until
the
end
of
the
world
until
the
last
member
is
complete
the
last
sheaf
of
the
great
harvest
gathered
in
thou
lovest
them
too
much
for
the
mockery
of
thy
foes
or
even
for
the
passionate
prayer
of
thy
friends
to
move
thee
to
come
down
from
the
cross
until
the
work
of
the
cross
is
finished
and
the
earnest
expectation
of
thy
suffering
creatures
changed
into
the
joy
unspeakable
of
the
manifestation
of
the
sons
of
god
chapter

by
abraham
pool
and
elsewhere
but
thou
hadst
gone
gone
from
the
dreary
land
gone
from
the
storms
let
loose
on
every
hill
lured
by
the
sweet
persuasion
of
a
hand
which
leads
thee
somewhere
in
the
distance
still
a
group
of
moslems
were
loitering
idly
beside
the
beautiful
pool
of
abraham
watching
the
sacred
fish
and
feeding
them
with
crumbs
and
corn
they
were
talking
over
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
some
of
them
who
would
not
have
hurt
one
of
those
little
fishes
for
any
consideration
were
boasting
how
many
christian
dogs
they
had
killed
or
detailing
yet
more
horrible
deeds
of
devotion
and
of
prowess
but
now
observed
one
of
them
we
are
not
to
kill
any
more
the
has
gone
forth
truth
to
say
another
answered
there
are
but
few
left
to
kill
and
those
are
mostly
old
women
and
little
children
it
were
well
a
third
remarked
to
take
some
order
about
the
burying
and
that
quickly
or
we
shall
have
a
pestilence
among
us
and
true
believers
have
no
charm
against
that
any
more
than
christians
allah
who
comes
here
a
weird
ghastly
figure
strode
in
amongst
them
coming
down
to
the
very
margin
of
the
pool
his
clothing
was
scorched
and
torn
his
hair
grey
almost
white
and
his
hollow
cheeks
and
wasted
face
gave
the
more
awful
expressiveness
to
large
eyes
full
of
horror
he
looked
down
into
the
bright
pure
waters
of
the
pool
much
water
there
he
said
but
it
will
not
put
out
the
fire
there
is
nothing
will
put
that
out
for
ever
and
for
ever
one
tried
to
lay
hands
on
him
another
drew
a
dagger
but
his
pale
lips
only
curled
with
a
scornful
smile
you
can
not
kill
me
he
said
i
am
an
englishman
there
is
a
mark
set
upon
me
that
no
man
may
hurt
me
it
means
saved
himself
others
he
did
not
save
put
that
up
said
one
of
the
turks
to
his
comrade
with
the
dagger
do
you
not
see
the
man
is
mad
moslems
think
it
wrong
to
kill
a
madman
they
even
honour
him
as
one
inspired
by
allah
nor
does
their
law
allow
them
to
receive
a
madman
as
a
convert
to
islam
englishman
another
queried
nonsense
about
englishmen
there
are
no
englishmen
here
that
no
doubt
is
part
of
his
madness
he
is
a
giaour
whom
it
is
the
will
of
allah
to
save
alive
a
young
man
dressed
la
joined
the
group
whom
have
you
got
here
he
asked
some
giaour
driven
mad
by
the
loss
of
his
friends
answered
one
of
the
others
the
giaour
turned
and
looked
the
new
comer
steadily
in
the
face
the
turk
looked
at
him
with
a
perplexed
bewildered
air
osman
effendi
how
many
giaours
have
killed
the
christian
asked
osman
answered
but
he
was
a
prince
amongst
them
it
was
enough
madman
i
seem
to
know
your
eyes
who
are
you
he
gave
him
another
long
scrutinizing
look
then
he
said
with
a
start
can
it
be
is
it
possible
are
you
grayson
effendi
how
have
you
come
here
i
sought
for
you
and
heard
you
had
gone
to
the
church
then
i
gave
you
up
for
lost
i
lost
jack
said
nay
friend
you
are
saved
thanks
to
allah
the
compassionate
but
how
in
his
name
did
you
get
out
i
have
not
the
least
idea
jack
said
the
last
thing
i
saw
was
those
children
falling
down
into
the
fire
the
first
thing
i
remember
after
that
i
was
walking
among
dead
bodies
in
the
churchyard
there
were
plenty
of
turks
about
but
they
did
not
kill
me
no
one
will
kill
me
i
fear
you
are
right
enough
said
osman
aside
to
the
others
it
is
a
pity
then
to
jack
come
home
with
me
grayson
effendi
i
will
take
care
of
you
and
give
you
meat
and
drink
then
you
shall
lie
down
and
sleep
no
i
shall
never
sleep
again
i
dare
not
i
should
see
the
burning
church
and
the
woman
who
threw
her
children
into
the
fire
poor
fellow
he
is
certainly
mad
said
another
turk
jack
turned
and
faced
him
i
am
not
mad
he
said
i
remember
all
my
past
life
i
am
an
englishman
my
name
is
john
grayson
you
have
taken
my
wife
away
at
least
is
madness
some
one
observed
not
altogether
whispered
osman
there
was
a
betrothal
or
something
to
a
beautiful
armenian
girl
franks
take
these
things
hard
then
aloud
but
come
with
me
grayson
effendi
you
will
be
quite
safe
jack
yielded
so
far
as
to
walk
away
with
him
from
the
group
but
when
they
had
gone
a
little
distance
he
stopped
and
said
very
quietly
osman
effendi
i
thank
you
but
i
can
not
enter
the
house
of
a
turk
i
must
go
back
to
the
ruined
dwellings
of
my
friends
i
would
say
bless
you
if
in
the
face
of
what
i
have
seen
i
could
still
believe
in
god
i
can
not
farewell
he
took
the
nearest
turning
which
led
to
the
armenian
quarter
and
soon
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
horrors
which
the
effects
of
no
siege
no
battle
known
to
history
could
have
equalled
the
dead
and
the
dying
too
who
lay
undistinguished
amongst
them
were
being
dragged
to
the
great
trenches
outside
the
town
which
the
moslems
had
dug
to
receive
them
there
were
many
houses
like
that
of
the
vartonians
in
which
no
human
creature
not
even
the
babe
in
arms
was
left
alive
on
and
on
he
wandered
from
one
horror
to
another
what
he
saw
in
its
details
is
best
left
untold
he
was
mad
the
consciousness
of
the
past
was
coming
back
upon
him
every
moment
more
clearly
and
fully
as
the
human
heart
will
ever
do
in
the
most
overpowering
most
universal
agony
he
still
reverted
to
his
own
shushan
shushan
was
his
cry
amidst
the
reeking
ruins
of
the
devastated
city
always
everywhere
it
is
not
the
all
we
care
for
but
the
one
we
are
made
so
he
bore
his
burden
alone
in
the
blank
unbelief
of
utter
despair
cold
strong
passionless
like
a
dead
man
clasp
there
closed
about
his
heart
the
horror
of
the
everlasting
no
choking
it
to
death
no
hope
no
love
no
god
no
christ
how
long
he
wandered
in
that
ghastly
scene
of
death
he
could
not
tell
some
desultory
plundering
was
still
going
on
parties
of
turks
chiefly
of
the
lowest
class
sometimes
met
him
but
no
one
thought
of
killing
him
the
killing
was
over
and
even
if
it
had
been
otherwise
his
supposed
madness
would
have
secured
his
safety
sometimes
he
saw
an
armenian
in
the
distance
gliding
in
the
shadow
of
a
wall
but
if
he
hailed
the
phantom
it
would
vanish
instantly
into
some
near
at
hand
he
barely
noticed
the
change
of
day
into
night
or
of
night
into
day
again
as
the
claims
of
his
physical
nature
asserted
themselves
he
took
food
almost
without
thinking
plenty
of
it
lay
about
uncared
for
in
the
desolated
homes
the
one
thing
he
did
not
dare
to
do
was
to
sleep
he
feared
the
dreams
that
would
be
sure
to
come
he
feared
still
more
the
awakening
after
what
seemed
to
himself
a
long
time
he
thought
he
heard
a
faint
cry
from
the
interior
of
a
house
in
the
courtyard
of
which
he
was
standing
he
went
in
and
was
guided
by
the
sound
to
a
store
closet
where
food
had
been
laid
up
there
on
the
ground
her
head
upon
a
sack
of
bulghour
lay
a
woman
quite
dead
beside
her
a
little
baby
probably
dying
also
better
let
it
die
so
reason
would
have
said
and
perhaps
kindness
too
nature
is
stronger
than
either
jack
stooped
down
took
up
in
his
arms
the
little
wailing
babe
and
tried
to
soothe
its
cries
evidently
it
was
starving
what
should
he
do
he
could
not
give
it
rice
or
bulghour
and
hard
dry
bread
even
dipped
in
fruit
syrup
would
not
be
more
suitable
how
could
he
feed
a
baby
then
all
at
once
he
thought
of
the
mission
house
miss
celandine
would
know
what
to
do
he
had
often
thought
of
her
before
but
either
he
supposed
her
out
of
reach
as
for
some
time
past
she
had
almost
been
or
else
unconsciously
he
shrank
from
going
where
he
used
to
find
shushan
moreover
for
aught
he
knew
she
might
by
this
time
have
left
the
place
he
thought
osman
told
him
she
had
got
her
passport
at
last
however
he
soon
found
himself
treading
the
familiar
way
by
which
he
had
gone
so
often
to
visit
shushan
how
clearly
he
saw
her
now
in
all
her
winning
loveliness
her
sweet
eyes
full
of
joy
coming
to
meet
him
with
her
little
hand
stretched
out
english
fashion
and
on
her
lips
the
one
word
he
had
not
seen
her
so
clearly
since
osman
tale
turned
his
heart
to
stone
as
he
went
he
held
the
little
babe
close
to
his
breast
to
keep
it
warm
and
half
feared
it
would
die
by
the
way
he
found
the
great
gate
of
the
mission
house
and
saw
forms
like
shadows
creeping
in
and
out
wretched
objects
most
of
them
with
bandaged
limbs
or
heads
the
spacious
courtyard
seemed
turned
into
a
hospital
men
women
and
little
children
sat
or
stood
about
waiting
to
be
treated
he
asked
some
one
where
he
might
find
miss
celandine
and
was
directed
to
the
church
what
a
transformation
that
beautiful
church
had
undergone
since
he
saw
it
last
if
the
yard
was
the
hospital
for
the
church
was
the
ward
where
those
lay
who
could
not
be
removed
it
was
crammed
from
end
to
end
with
men
and
boys
the
wounded
and
the
dying
their
mats
were
placed
on
the
floor
so
close
together
that
it
was
hard
to
move
among
them
still
the
first
thought
of
relief
and
softness
came
to
jack
as
he
stood
there
and
looked
around
him
there
at
least
love
reigned
not
hate
once
more
he
was
amongst
beings
who
were
human
and
who
pitied
and
helped
one
another
he
did
not
see
miss
celandine
there
but
an
armenian
woman
with
a
sweet
serene
face
came
towards
him
and
enquired
what
he
wanted
he
showed
her
the
babe
can
you
save
it
he
asked
we
will
try
she
answered
taking
it
gently
from
him
poor
little
one
i
fear
it
is
too
late
does
it
belong
to
you
is
it
perhaps
your
little
grandchild
she
asked
looking
up
at
him
it
occurred
to
jack
that
the
question
was
a
strange
one
but
was
anything
strange
now
he
answered
no
i
found
it
just
now
beside
its
dead
mother
i
know
not
who
they
are
where
is
miss
celandine
anna
hanum
asked
a
servant
coming
up
there
is
a
boy
here
in
great
distress
who
wants
to
speak
with
her
she
will
be
here
just
now
said
the
woman
who
was
speaking
to
jack
where
is
the
boy
he
came
running
in
after
the
messenger
pale
and
crying
as
one
in
sore
trouble
he
seemed
to
know
anna
hanum
and
began
to
pour
out
to
her
his
tale
of
sorrow
its
burden
was
i
have
denied
my
lord
i
have
denied
the
lord
jesus
christ
will
he
ever
forgive
me
how
was
it
my
poor
child
the
woman
asked
pityingly
they
killed
my
father
and
my
mother
he
said
then
they
held
a
knife
to
my
throat
and
asked
me
to
be
a
moslem
and
save
my
life
in
my
terror
i
said
i
know
not
what
but
it
must
have
been
for
they
spared
me
took
me
to
a
turkish
house
and
gave
me
food
they
kept
me
shut
up
until
now
when
i
ran
away
and
came
here
will
christ
ever
forgive
me
oh
do
you
think
he
will
ever
forgive
me
ere
she
could
answer
there
came
a
faint
weak
voice
from
one
of
the
sufferers
lying
at
their
feet
christ
will
forgive
you
only
you
have
lost
a
grand
opportunity
something
in
the
voice
sent
a
thrill
of
strange
sweet
memories
through
the
heart
of
john
grayson
he
turned
towards
the
spot
from
whence
it
came
who
said
that
he
asked
a
man
horribly
mutilated
pointed
out
to
him
a
boy
who
was
lying
beside
him
with
a
light
rug
thrown
over
him
threading
his
way
with
difficulty
through
the
mats
on
which
the
patients
lay
jack
came
to
his
side
and
knelt
down
he
saw
a
young
face
white
wasted
and
drawn
with
pain
yet
full
of
a
strange
unutterable
peace
and
he
knew
it
was
the
face
he
loved
best
in
the
house
of
meneshian
after
the
through
whom
his
heart
had
got
its
death
blow
he
said
who
is
it
asked
the
boy
is
it
no
it
is
not
it
can
not
be
and
yet
you
have
the
eyes
of
yon
effendi
you
used
to
call
me
that
in
the
old
days
oh
gabriel
i
thought
they
had
killed
you
all
yes
gabriel
said
and
into
his
eyes
there
came
instead
of
tears
a
light
from
beyond
the
sun
beyond
the
stars
we
have
all
come
home
now
except
me
i
am
just
a
little
late
for
the
first
there
but
i
forget
my
pain
in
thinking
of
their
happy
meeting
all
together
and
of
the
joy
they
have
in
seeing
the
face
of
christ
besides
he
is
here
with
me
too
and
i
think
he
will
let
me
go
to
them
soon
then
a
wave
of
bitter
pain
surged
over
the
soul
of
john
grayson
he
supposed
gabriel
did
not
count
as
any
longer
one
of
them
her
who
in
the
earthly
home
had
been
the
dearest
of
them
all
could
he
think
the
heavenly
home
would
be
complete
without
her
you
must
have
suffered
yon
effendi
gabriel
went
on
looking
at
his
changed
face
and
grey
hair
but
i
never
thought
to
see
you
again
we
all
made
sure
the
turks
had
taken
and
killed
you
would
they
had
jack
said
gabriel
how
did
escape
when
all
the
rest
were
killed
when
they
killed
us
all
and
our
cousins
the
vartonians
too
they
cut
and
wounded
me
and
left
me
for
dead
i
suppose
i
was
a
long
time
unconscious
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
lying
among
the
bodies
almost
under
them
i
pushed
my
way
out
a
little
that
i
might
see
i
did
not
want
to
live
but
i
knew
how
they
would
drag
the
dead
and
the
dying
too
out
of
the
town
and
fling
them
into
the
ditches
beneath
the
wall
i
was
afraid
of
so
i
lay
very
still
until
night
came
and
all
was
quiet
then
i
managed
somehow
to
get
myself
free
i
crept
along
slowly
i
know
not
how
i
think
i
fainted
often
by
the
way
but
at
last
i
came
here
to
the
place
in
all
the
world
most
like
to
heaven
and
here
they
will
let
me
stay
until
i
go
to
heaven
itself
the
boy
voice
was
beginning
to
fail
through
weakness
do
try
to
speak
any
more
jack
said
oh
but
i
to
tell
you
can
you
give
me
a
drink
jack
saw
a
pitcher
of
water
cooled
with
snow
and
a
cup
beside
it
not
far
off
he
poured
out
some
and
brought
it
will
you
lift
my
head
a
little
and
put
it
to
my
lips
gabriel
said
my
hands
are
cut
in
pieces
thank
you
that
is
good
i
to
tell
you
how
god
brought
home
the
three
who
were
away
from
us
that
day
the
you
did
not
know
that
our
dear
grandfather
had
gone
the
night
before
to
visit
his
old
friends
the
nazarians
and
he
found
them
so
frightened
with
only
women
there
in
the
house
that
he
stayed
but
in
the
morning
when
we
knew
what
was
coming
kevork
went
to
seek
for
him
that
we
might
die
all
together
neither
of
them
ever
came
back
to
us
only
yesterday
did
we
hear
about
kevork
one
of
the
sheiks
made
his
followers
bring
him
all
the
strong
young
men
he
could
find
about
a
hundred
were
brought
to
him
he
had
them
held
down
hand
and
foot
by
his
followers
while
he
cut
their
throats
with
his
own
hand
reciting
all
the
time
verses
from
the
koran
kevork
was
among
them
and
our
dear
father
hohannes
he
was
at
the
nazarians
as
i
said
he
thought
that
perhaps
the
turks
having
killed
the
men
might
be
satisfied
and
go
away
so
he
bade
the
women
conceal
themselves
and
sat
calmly
at
the
door
reading
his
bible
when
they
saw
him
there
they
said
are
an
old
man
with
white
hair
we
will
spare
you
if
you
will
only
acknowledge
the
prophet
you
need
not
speak
just
lift
up
one
finger
will
not
lift
up
one
finger
said
he
then
they
dragged
him
out
into
the
street
to
kill
him
and
and
yon
effendi
i
can
tell
you
no
more
spare
me
he
turned
his
white
face
away
with
a
look
of
agony
dear
boy
dear
child
tell
me
no
more
if
it
hurts
you
so
jack
whispered
soothingly
however
dreadful
it
may
have
been
it
is
over
now
it
was
not
so
dreadful
gabriel
said
after
a
pause
it
was
soon
over
but
oh
yon
effendi
there
is
i
said
were
absent
from
us
his
dark
wistful
eyes
so
full
of
pain
gazed
piteously
into
the
wondering
face
bent
over
him
a
distant
suspicion
of
who
the
third
might
mean
dawned
for
the
first
time
on
john
grayson
you
said
three
were
brought
home
to
heaven
hohannes
kevork
and
in
unutterable
anguish
john
grayson
turned
his
face
away
he
murmured
hoarsely
shushan
is
not
in
heaven
but
gabriel
half
raised
himself
in
his
intense
excitement
then
you
know
it
is
who
do
know
jack
interrupted
bitterly
there
is
no
such
blessedness
as
death
for
her
or
for
me
oh
but
you
do
know
gabriel
said
again
yon
effendi
listen
you
listen
to
me
i
have
comfort
for
you
what
comfort
possible
for
me
the
comfort
of
god
our
shushan
is
with
him
jack
turned
and
looked
again
in
the
face
of
gabriel
his
own
was
set
and
drawn
in
its
anguish
of
suspense
his
lips
moved
but
only
one
word
would
come
speak
as
they
were
killing
my
grandfather
zaptiehs
passed
by
with
shushan
guarded
in
their
midst
she
saw
his
white
hair
his
face
and
broke
through
them
all
to
throw
her
arms
around
him
and
plead
for
his
life
they
were
taken
by
surprise
and
did
not
stop
her
in
time
no
one
knows
how
it
happened
but
in
the
confusion
a
sword
meant
for
him
went
right
through
her
heart
john
grayson
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
cry
that
made
all
the
wounded
round
them
turn
on
their
mats
and
look
up
in
wonder
he
never
even
heard
gabriel
concluding
word
so
as
i
said
they
are
all
now
with
christ
but
in
another
moment
he
was
on
the
ground
again
beside
him
his
whole
frame
shaking
with
a
storm
of
sobs
hoarse
heavy
uncontrollable
surging
up
from
the
very
depths
of
a
strong
man
soul
after
the
sobs
came
tears
tears
again
at
last
no
longer
were
the
heavens
iron
and
the
earth
brass
all
the
were
open
now
and
there
was
a
very
great
rain
he
knew
nothing
until
miss
celandine
firm
gentle
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
my
friend
she
said
i
know
not
who
you
are
nor
what
your
grief
may
be
but
i
can
not
let
you
disturb
all
the
others
who
are
here
especially
you
are
doing
great
harm
to
my
patient
beside
you
do
you
know
me
miss
celandine
jack
faltered
out
struggling
for
composure
do
you
remember
john
grayson
john
grayson
but
he
was
a
youth
and
your
hair
is
grey
with
anguish
but
now
i
remember
no
more
my
anguish
for
god
has
had
mercy
upon
me
my
shushan
is
with
him
yes
we
know
it
and
thank
god
for
her
chapter
xxi
god
satisfied
and
earth
undone
and
if
with
milder
anguish
now
i
bear
to
think
of
thee
in
thy
forsaken
rest
if
from
my
heart
be
lifted
the
despair
the
sharp
remorse
with
healing
influence
press
it
is
that
thou
the
sacrifice
hast
bless
and
filled
my
spirit
in
its
inmost
cell
with
a
deep
chastened
sense
that
all
at
last
is
well
john
grayson
had
been
directed
by
miss
celandine
to
go
to
the
parlour
where
shushan
had
bidden
him
farewell
and
to
wait
for
her
there
it
looked
as
if
it
had
had
many
occupants
since
and
as
if
some
of
them
were
still
in
possession
yet
for
the
moment
he
was
alone
a
thing
unusual
in
that
crowded
house
his
heart
was
filled
with
a
sense
of
unspeakable
rest
and
after
rest
came
thankfulness
and
with
thankfulness
a
fresh
burst
of
weeping
his
tears
growing
ever
gentler
ever
softer
and
more
full
of
healing
in
those
blessed
tears
he
found
again
his
hope
and
his
god
christ
was
no
dream
but
a
living
loving
power
strong
to
save
he
had
been
with
his
beloved
one
and
had
delivered
her
once
more
in
the
darkness
his
hand
touched
that
right
hand
so
strong
and
so
tender
which
at
once
upholds
the
universe
and
supports
the
failing
heart
of
every
tried
and
tempted
wrestler
with
the
spirit
until
the
breaking
of
the
day
so
already
the
cross
of
christ
laid
upon
both
their
heads
had
been
taken
from
shushan
young
brow
and
she
had
received
instead
of
it
the
crown
of
life
while
he
who
loved
her
who
would
love
her
until
his
life
end
he
had
to
bear
it
still
but
it
the
cross
of
christ
and
not
the
brand
of
cain
not
never
that
again
never
more
would
he
wander
aimlessly
amidst
the
dying
and
the
dead
beating
in
upon
his
weary
brain
as
though
it
were
the
burden
of
a
song
that
hideous
travesty
of
the
enemy
splendid
unconscious
testimony
to
his
crucified
lord
he
saved
himself
others
he
did
not
save
rather
perhaps
might
he
be
permitted
in
some
humble
way
to
follow
him
and
help
to
save
others
of
himself
there
seemed
little
left
to
save
now
the
traveller
whose
purse
is
empty
sings
before
the
thieves
and
if
he
has
been
just
relieved
of
a
crushing
killing
burden
his
song
may
even
be
one
of
thanksgiving
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
had
been
waiting
in
that
room
when
another
person
came
in
and
sat
down
waiting
also
she
had
with
her
three
pale
little
children
had
he
judged
by
her
dress
alone
he
would
have
thought
her
an
armenian
woman
of
the
very
poorest
class
but
one
look
in
her
face
made
him
know
her
as
a
lady
it
was
a
very
sorrowful
face
what
armenian
face
was
not
sorrowful
then
but
it
was
also
very
beautiful
and
it
bore
the
unmistakable
impress
of
a
refined
and
cultured
mind
he
felt
sure
he
had
seen
her
somewhere
before
she
was
associated
somehow
in
his
mind
with
a
box
of
sweetmeats
an
odd
fancy
for
which
he
could
find
no
reason
but
his
thoughts
soon
left
her
and
returned
to
their
own
engrossing
theme
thomassian
effendi
said
one
of
the
children
presently
in
a
wailing
voice
wo
you
take
me
up
in
your
lap
i
am
tired
jack
looked
round
in
surprise
could
this
be
indeed
the
beautiful
luxurious
cherished
wife
of
muggurditch
thomassian
he
spoke
his
thoughts
aloud
madame
he
asked
do
i
speak
to
the
wife
of
baron
thomassian
to
his
widow
she
answered
calmly
so
much
jack
knew
already
and
he
wondered
if
the
lady
knew
any
more
have
you
had
certain
tidings
of
his
he
paused
for
an
instant
unwilling
to
voice
the
word
of
his
martyrdom
the
widow
said
proudly
yes
he
has
gone
home
to
god
the
way
was
long
and
rough
but
the
end
was
peace
then
you
know
how
nobly
he
witnessed
for
his
lord
we
know
that
he
was
found
faithful
i
was
with
him
almost
to
the
end
jack
said
then
he
told
the
story
of
his
imprisonment
and
of
thomassian
courage
and
faithfulness
every
word
was
as
balm
poured
into
the
bleeding
heart
of
the
widow
and
now
madame
he
said
at
last
how
is
it
with
you
in
your
loneliness
as
i
suppose
you
know
we
have
been
robbed
of
everything
my
husband
was
known
to
be
a
rich
man
and
our
house
was
one
which
invited
plunder
what
does
it
matter
when
a
scorpion
has
stung
you
you
do
not
feel
the
prick
of
a
gnat
all
i
want
is
a
handful
of
rice
to
feed
these
poor
little
ones
are
they
relatives
perhaps
asked
jack
he
knew
she
had
no
children
no
they
are
poor
orphans
i
found
in
the
street
crying
for
their
mothers
it
helps
me
in
my
desolation
to
have
them
to
think
and
work
for
that
is
why
i
have
come
to
miss
celandine
i
think
she
may
give
me
something
to
do
i
care
not
what
anything
to
keep
these
from
starving
and
me
in
another
way
perhaps
you
can
help
her
in
caring
for
the
wounded
i
fear
i
have
no
skill
for
it
i
am
not
like
anna
hanum
whom
you
may
have
seen
and
who
is
to
miss
celandine
as
another
hand
jack
remembered
with
a
pang
that
he
himself
owed
baron
thomassian
money
which
he
had
no
means
of
repaying
other
people
dropped
in
gradually
to
wait
for
miss
celandine
and
began
to
comment
upon
her
long
delay
amaan
something
fresh
must
have
happened
they
said
of
course
they
meant
some
fresh
calamity
what
else
could
happen
there
at
last
food
was
brought
in
great
dishes
of
pillav
and
of
soup
with
bread
meat
there
was
none
i
would
miss
celandine
were
here
madame
thomassian
said
to
jack
she
will
not
have
tasted
food
since
the
early
morning
only
that
god
gives
her
strength
for
our
sakes
she
would
have
been
dead
long
ago
presently
there
was
a
stir
amongst
them
all
here
she
comes
passed
from
lip
to
lip
she
came
but
not
alone
her
arm
was
around
the
waist
of
a
tall
slender
girl
who
but
for
its
support
might
have
fallen
to
the
ground
another
girl
much
younger
clung
to
her
side
and
two
boys
followed
the
elder
carrying
in
his
arms
his
little
brother
a
child
of
three
her
wasted
face
was
lit
up
with
a
glow
almost
of
triumph
we
have
got
them
she
said
those
in
the
room
rose
up
and
crowded
round
some
said
park
derocha
others
wept
aloud
for
joy
for
all
knew
the
pastor
children
oh
if
the
badvellie
could
only
look
down
and
see
them
all
safe
here
some
one
cried
he
does
not
want
that
madame
thomassian
answered
quietly
for
he
knows
the
end
of
the
lord
the
children
were
soon
seated
on
the
divan
every
one
wanted
to
kiss
their
lips
their
hands
their
feet
even
their
clothing
was
an
odd
mixture
elmas
wore
a
dress
of
miss
celandine
the
rest
whatever
garments
had
come
first
to
hand
for
the
turks
had
stripped
them
of
almost
everything
my
zaptiehs
have
just
found
them
in
a
mosque
and
brought
them
to
me
miss
celandine
explained
they
are
starving
indeed
the
lips
of
little
ozmo
were
already
quite
blue
he
seemed
unable
even
to
cry
some
one
ran
to
get
milk
for
him
and
in
a
short
time
all
were
being
fed
and
tended
by
loving
hands
then
everybody
ate
in
a
primitive
informal
way
jack
had
his
handful
of
rice
and
his
piece
of
bread
with
the
rest
and
no
food
he
had
ever
tasted
seemed
to
him
more
wonderful
than
this
he
was
eating
with
christians
again
there
sat
miss
celandine
in
her
frail
womanhood
a
tower
of
strength
to
them
all
there
were
the
dear
pastor
rescued
children
pale
and
changed
indeed
from
the
unfathomed
depths
of
suffering
they
had
passed
through
but
all
there
not
one
lacking
from
the
little
flock
there
was
the
sweet
face
of
elmas
his
friend
and
shushan
was
safe
too
god
had
forgotten
to
be
gracious
nor
had
he
in
anger
shut
up
his
tender
mercies
from
them
jack
went
over
to
elmas
dear
oriort
elmas
he
said
do
you
know
me
i
am
john
grayson
my
shushan
loved
you
well
and
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
she
is
so
are
all
the
rest
although
gabriel
only
is
with
us
still
but
now
miss
celandine
was
clearing
the
room
that
the
pastor
children
might
have
the
rest
and
quiet
they
so
sorely
needed
there
was
not
another
spot
in
the
crowded
mission
buildings
that
could
be
given
up
to
them
with
those
who
needed
her
she
would
speak
in
the
passage
outside
jack
waited
patiently
for
his
turn
and
it
came
at
last
it
may
have
been
a
relief
to
the
lonely
woman
to
use
the
tongue
of
her
native
land
again
for
she
took
time
to
tell
him
how
the
pastor
children
had
been
saved
the
captain
of
my
zaptiehs
saw
my
anguish
during
the
awful
days
she
said
he
was
moved
and
asked
me
was
there
anything
he
could
do
for
me
i
said
these
horrors
he
answered
that
he
could
not
is
the
will
of
allah
he
said
as
they
all
say
then
i
answered
those
children
for
me
and
bring
them
here
they
are
mine
they
belong
to
the
mission
and
i
described
them
all
to
him
i
believe
he
sought
them
diligently
and
now
here
they
are
at
last
after
nights
and
days
of
cold
and
hunger
and
of
agonizing
fear
yet
god
has
kept
them
now
as
for
you
grayson
will
you
come
with
me
i
have
something
to
give
you
he
followed
her
to
another
room
filled
with
people
where
washing
and
cooking
were
going
on
motioning
him
to
stay
at
the
door
she
made
her
way
over
beds
mats
babies
and
cooking
utensils
to
a
press
which
she
opened
took
something
out
and
came
back
with
it
they
went
to
the
court
together
without
speaking
and
there
under
the
leafless
branches
of
a
john
grayson
got
back
his
father
bible
the
book
of
his
betrothal
shushan
said
to
me
one
day
that
if
her
end
of
the
cross
was
the
first
lifted
off
i
was
to
give
this
to
you
see
there
is
a
bit
of
silk
put
in
to
mark
the
place
she
was
reading
when
she
was
sent
for
to
receive
her
father
blessing
jack
opened
the
book
and
these
were
the
words
his
eyes
fell
upon
speak
ye
comfortably
to
jerusalem
and
cry
unto
her
that
her
warfare
is
accomplished
that
her
iniquity
is
pardoned
for
she
hath
received
of
the
lord
hand
double
for
all
her
sins
he
pointed
them
out
to
miss
celandine
who
only
said
the
it
is
that
makes
it
possible
to
live
but
grayson
what
will
you
do
now
anything
tell
me
for
the
present
you
will
stay
here
with
us
until
the
way
opens
for
your
safe
return
home
miss
celandine
did
not
go
home
the
passport
which
i
asked
for
more
than
two
months
ago
was
only
sent
to
me
on
saturday
one
hour
before
the
massacre
began
then
the
pasha
was
most
anxious
to
get
me
away
he
advised
he
even
urged
me
to
go
so
i
knew
that
evil
was
determined
against
this
people
and
of
course
i
stayed
if
you
had
gone
i
suppose
that
not
one
of
them
would
now
be
left
alive
jack
said
certainly
not
one
of
the
three
hundred
that
were
in
our
premises
then
miss
celandine
answered
quietly
grayson
it
is
but
poor
hospitality
i
have
to
offer
you
not
a
room
even
only
a
place
to
lie
down
in
somewhere
and
day
by
day
a
morsel
of
bread
safety
peace
jack
said
if
you
permit
me
miss
celandine
i
might
spread
a
mat
in
the
church
and
give
a
little
help
especially
at
night
to
the
wounded
who
are
lying
there
then
i
could
be
near
gabriel
the
only
living
thing
left
to
me
of
my
own
so
you
can
here
you
work
or
you
will
die
but
here
also
if
you
serve
christ
in
his
brethren
you
will
find
him
another
thing
you
can
do
for
us
your
strength
is
sorely
needed
to
bring
to
us
our
patients
and
to
help
them
back
again
to
their
homes
or
rather
to
the
desolated
ruins
that
were
once
their
homes
all
this
john
grayson
did
faithfully
in
body
he
was
never
alone
by
day
and
by
night
he
lived
in
a
crowd
a
crowd
of
suffering
men
but
in
spirit
he
sat
alone
and
kept
silence
because
he
bore
upon
him
the
yoke
or
rather
the
cross
of
christ
he
put
his
mouth
in
the
dust
if
so
there
might
be
hope
and
there
hope
for
him
though
the
light
was
kindled
at
no
earthly
shrine
it
was
his
greatest
comfort
to
wait
upon
gabriel
but
gabriel
did
not
think
it
well
that
time
and
trouble
should
be
spent
on
him
it
is
waste
he
said
to
jack
there
are
so
many
wanting
your
help
who
have
hands
to
work
with
better
go
to
them
for
what
should
do
if
i
live
god
will
see
to
that
brother
i
know
only
if
you
drop
a
handful
of
piastres
in
the
street
you
try
to
pick
up
the
good
ones
first
elmas
stepanian
loved
well
to
steal
a
few
moments
from
the
care
of
her
young
brothers
to
sit
by
gabriel
and
minister
to
his
wants
his
eyes
used
to
brighten
wonderfully
when
he
saw
her
you
are
so
good
and
sweet
he
used
to
say
once
he
added
and
oriort
elmas
our
kevork
loved
you
so
elmas
did
not
blush
or
turn
her
face
away
she
only
said
quietly
my
dear
father
liked
your
brother
well
for
indeed
death
was
so
near
them
life
cooled
from
its
heat
contrary
to
every
one
expectation
the
little
babe
john
grayson
saved
took
hold
of
its
life
with
a
will
two
or
three
times
it
was
very
near
dying
but
it
always
rallied
in
spite
of
tainted
air
imperfect
nourishment
and
other
disadvantages
it
gave
promise
of
growing
into
a
bright
healthy
child
anna
hanum
miss
celandine
helper
who
had
taken
it
first
from
john
grayson
arms
brought
it
one
day
to
show
to
him
with
pride
and
pleasure
but
as
she
held
it
up
he
was
far
more
struck
with
her
own
face
than
with
that
of
the
babe
in
her
arms
it
was
full
of
peace
profound
and
utter
such
peace
as
one
may
see
in
the
faces
of
the
happy
dead
only
this
was
a
living
face
glowing
with
some
inner
light
of
love
and
blessedness
when
she
was
gone
he
turned
to
madame
thomassian
who
chanced
to
be
at
hand
waiting
for
some
work
it
does
me
good
to
look
at
that
face
of
anna
hanum
he
said
she
comes
among
these
suffering
people
like
a
light
in
the
darkness
ever
ready
to
soothe
the
sorrows
of
others
because
alone
of
all
here
she
seems
to
have
none
of
her
own
none
of
her
own
oh
grayson
how
little
you
know
have
you
ever
heard
her
story
i
have
not
her
husband
was
a
long
time
ill
paralysed
the
years
went
on
and
she
had
a
weary
life
of
it
waiting
on
him
night
and
day
and
earning
bread
for
both
of
them
nor
they
say
did
he
make
her
toil
light
by
loving
gratitude
she
never
complained
but
the
neighbours
knew
that
sickness
had
soured
his
temper
and
things
went
not
easily
with
her
but
she
had
one
great
joy
god
good
gift
to
her
the
childless
woman
who
told
the
tale
repressed
a
little
sigh
as
she
went
on
her
bright
beautiful
gifted
boy
was
the
pride
of
all
the
neighbourhood
she
loved
him
with
more
than
a
mother
love
and
she
toiled
and
slaved
and
almost
starved
herself
to
give
him
the
learning
she
set
such
store
by
and
he
thirsted
for
so
ardently
himself
he
was
the
best
pupil
in
the
school
here
and
then
he
went
on
to
aintab
and
to
marash
where
every
one
had
the
highest
hopes
of
him
you
may
guess
his
mother
pride
when
he
came
back
with
all
his
honours
to
see
her
before
beginning
active
life
he
was
just
in
time
to
receive
his
blessing
and
to
close
his
eyes
but
he
stayed
on
a
little
while
with
her
and
it
was
god
will
that
he
should
still
be
here
when
the
storm
broke
upon
us
grayson
they
killed
him
slowly
with
cruel
torture
before
his
mother
eyes
she
stood
by
strengthening
him
to
the
last
and
bidding
him
hold
fast
to
his
faith
and
his
god
and
she
has
come
through
jack
said
much
moved
she
has
come
through
and
she
has
come
forth
on
the
other
side
god
has
satisfied
her
with
himself
now
her
own
burden
gone
she
goes
about
helping
and
comforting
all
the
rest
with
heaven
in
her
face
and
heaven
in
her
heart
i
have
satisfied
the
weary
soul
and
i
have
replenished
every
sorrowful
soul
john
grayson
repeated
to
himself
yes
can
do
these
are
the
miracles
he
works
now
instead
of
dividing
seas
and
scattering
hostile
hosts
meanwhile
madame
thomassian
gathered
up
the
needlework
she
had
come
to
fetch
coarse
garments
for
some
of
the
many
who
needed
them
and
jack
could
not
help
remembering
the
soft
luxurious
life
surrounded
by
every
indulgence
wealth
could
procure
which
had
once
been
hers
now
she
toiled
on
from
day
to
day
content
with
the
pittance
which
was
all
miss
celandine
had
to
give
to
the
poor
women
who
were
thus
employed
and
contriving
out
of
that
pittance
to
feed
the
little
waifs
she
had
taken
from
the
street
even
as
she
turned
and
went
her
way
he
heard
her
softly
singing
to
herself
that
favourite
hymn
of
the
persecuted
armenians
jesus
i
my
cross
have
taken
all
to
leave
and
follow
thee
destitute
despised
forsaken
thou
from
hence
my
all
shalt
be
perish
every
fond
ambition
all
i
sought
or
hoped
or
known
yet
how
rich
is
my
condition
god
and
heaven
are
still
my
own
chapter
xxii
given
back
from
the
dead
when
we
can
love
and
pray
over
all
and
through
all
the
past
and
the
victory
come
glory
be
to
god
tom
one
day
jack
roused
himself
to
go
to
the
desolated
house
of
the
vartonians
very
few
of
the
surviving
armenians
dared
to
be
seen
walking
in
their
own
quarter
and
it
was
said
by
an
no
man
was
ever
seen
to
walk
upright
there
they
crept
furtively
about
with
bowed
heads
slipping
from
shadow
to
shadow
afraid
of
the
face
of
day
and
the
eyes
of
their
fellow
men
jack
object
in
going
was
to
find
if
possible
his
father
which
he
had
entrusted
to
kevork
to
give
shushan
in
case
of
his
own
death
it
was
to
him
a
very
precious
relic
and
he
thought
it
might
probably
be
amongst
the
things
that
had
escaped
the
plunderers
as
there
was
nothing
in
its
plain
appearance
and
binding
to
attract
them
it
was
agony
to
enter
that
court
knowing
all
that
had
happened
there
and
to
pass
through
those
desolate
rooms
associated
in
his
mind
with
all
the
pleasant
trifles
of
domestic
life
thinking
that
every
voice
which
he
had
heard
there
save
gabriel
was
now
hushed
in
death
every
foot
that
trod
those
floors
was
dust
even
that
dust
had
no
quiet
in
the
shadow
of
a
christian
church
those
horrible
trenches
outside
the
gate
those
hotbeds
of
fever
and
pestilence
told
that
if
the
living
were
dumb
a
cry
that
shivered
to
the
tingling
stars
was
going
up
from
the
desecrated
dead
jack
passed
sadly
through
the
rooms
he
knew
yet
did
know
as
they
looked
now
but
failed
in
any
of
them
to
find
what
he
sought
at
last
he
came
to
a
chamber
upstairs
where
he
was
startled
to
see
a
human
figure
lying
at
full
length
on
the
floor
if
it
were
a
dead
man
the
death
must
have
been
very
recent
but
when
he
came
near
he
saw
at
once
that
this
was
not
death
but
quiet
natural
sleep
the
man
dress
was
la
good
and
new
and
his
side
face
which
was
all
jack
could
see
had
the
look
of
life
almost
of
health
it
had
a
look
besides
which
made
jack
cry
aloud
in
amazement
kevork
my
brother
the
voice
aroused
the
sleeper
he
sat
up
and
looked
about
him
who
is
it
he
asked
then
after
a
moment
astonished
gaze
if
yon
effendi
father
were
not
dead
i
would
think
he
had
come
to
look
for
his
son
in
this
charnel
house
brother
i
yon
effendi
how
have
you
come
back
to
us
from
the
dead
what
does
it
matter
are
they
not
dead
all
of
them
you
too
they
told
me
you
perished
in
the
burning
church
and
they
told
your
throat
was
cut
kevork
put
his
hand
to
his
throat
where
a
red
mark
still
remained
the
work
was
done
but
not
well
enough
he
said
would
it
had
been
why
spare
this
blood
of
which
no
drop
flows
any
more
in
the
veins
of
any
living
man
that
is
not
true
kevork
gabriel
lives
gabriel
how
did
he
escape
not
not
do
not
say
he
denied
the
faith
not
no
he
was
heroically
faithful
he
was
left
for
dead
but
he
lives
still
how
he
will
rejoice
to
see
you
again
my
brother
a
deeper
shade
passed
over
the
face
of
kevork
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
jack
my
he
repeated
pausing
on
the
word
at
last
he
went
on
in
a
low
voice
i
know
all
your
anguish
and
mine
are
the
same
our
shushan
and
oriort
elmas
are
saved
jack
cried
pressing
his
hand
in
a
mighty
grasp
and
looking
in
his
sorrowful
face
his
own
radiant
with
thankfulness
treasure
is
safe
in
heaven
yours
still
on
earth
in
the
mission
house
with
miss
celandine
the
pastor
children
have
been
rescued
and
are
there
thank
god
kevork
meneshian
bowed
his
head
and
did
what
john
grayson
himself
had
done
in
the
hour
of
his
blessed
relief
from
an
anguish
too
great
for
tears
jack
let
him
weep
for
a
while
then
he
said
gently
come
brother
let
me
bring
you
to
our
friends
who
will
rejoice
over
you
as
over
one
given
back
to
them
from
the
dead
on
the
way
kevork
told
his
story
that
morning
he
said
when
we
knew
what
was
coming
i
went
to
fetch
our
grandfather
that
we
might
all
die
together
there
was
no
more
danger
and
no
less
in
the
street
than
at
home
but
i
was
soon
caught
by
the
turks
yes
said
jack
that
we
heard
and
your
throat
was
cut
there
is
the
mark
but
there
were
a
hundred
of
us
so
the
sheikh
hand
grew
weary
ere
he
finished
i
was
near
the
end
of
the
long
line
and
i
only
got
a
hasty
gash
i
did
not
even
lose
consciousness
but
i
was
afraid
to
stir
so
i
lay
there
in
my
pain
thinking
i
should
bleed
to
death
some
soldiers
came
along
and
looked
at
the
bodies
they
saw
i
was
not
dead
and
were
going
to
finish
me
when
a
turk
interposed
and
bade
them
let
me
alone
he
had
hard
work
to
protect
me
from
them
nor
did
he
succeed
without
striking
one
of
them
pretty
sharply
with
the
butt
end
of
his
gun
then
i
saw
his
face
and
recognised
that
osman
we
met
once
or
twice
a
friend
of
the
pastor
osman
he
told
me
he
rescued
an
armenian
an
acquaintance
i
wonder
he
did
not
name
you
where
did
you
meet
him
we
were
together
in
the
prison
i
suppose
he
suspected
some
spy
within
hearing
well
he
took
me
to
his
house
bound
up
my
wound
and
hid
me
in
an
inner
chamber
there
he
left
me
promising
soon
to
return
but
for
three
days
and
nights
i
saw
him
not
again
nor
any
one
you
may
guess
what
i
suffered
shut
up
there
thinking
of
all
our
friends
and
you
must
have
been
nearly
starved
no
he
left
me
some
food
though
i
was
too
miserable
to
care
for
it
at
last
he
came
and
told
me
he
had
been
imprisoned
for
assaulting
the
soldier
who
wanted
to
kill
me
his
relatives
as
he
suspected
having
contrived
the
thing
to
keep
him
out
of
harm
way
since
he
knew
they
thought
him
lacking
in
a
proper
zeal
for
islam
but
on
my
account
and
still
more
on
that
of
the
badvellie
children
whom
he
wanted
to
save
he
had
been
very
eager
to
get
out
and
managed
it
at
last
with
large
backsheesh
he
told
me
all
the
terrible
news
of
those
who
were
dead
and
of
those
who
less
happy
were
living
still
after
a
sad
pause
he
went
on
for
myself
i
am
grateful
to
him
he
supplied
all
my
wants
and
kept
me
concealed
there
many
days
at
last
yesterday
he
came
to
me
and
said
can
hide
you
no
longer
people
are
beginning
to
suspect
something
if
they
find
you
they
will
kill
you
and
kill
me
also
for
giving
you
shelter
i
said
myself
i
care
not
for
what
have
i
left
to
live
for
but
added
that
i
could
not
bear
he
should
suffer
on
my
account
so
he
said
the
best
he
could
do
for
me
was
to
give
me
a
frank
dress
arranged
as
mussulmans
wear
it
and
money
enough
to
keep
me
for
the
present
which
he
did
and
may
god
reward
him
and
number
him
if
it
so
may
be
with
any
turk
amongst
his
redeemed
amen
jack
said
he
did
not
like
to
tell
kevork
what
osman
evidently
had
not
told
him
that
the
father
of
oriort
elmas
had
fallen
by
his
hand
there
was
no
need
for
more
for
now
they
were
at
the
gate
of
the
mission
house
it
is
best
jack
said
that
i
should
bring
you
first
to
miss
celandine
she
will
know
what
to
do
for
we
must
not
tell
gabriel
too
suddenly
he
is
ill
and
weak
you
must
be
prepared
kevork
to
see
him
greatly
changed
yet
the
meeting
between
the
brothers
seemed
to
fan
the
feeble
flickering
spark
of
gabriel
life
into
a
flame
it
was
another
tie
to
earth
to
feel
he
had
one
brother
there
left
him
still
no
brothers
as
he
said
looking
lovingly
at
jack
a
little
while
afterwards
jack
was
sent
for
one
day
by
miss
celandine
franks
have
come
to
her
from
aintab
said
the
excited
messenger
delighted
to
think
that
miss
celandine
long
loneliness
was
over
jack
went
to
her
at
once
he
found
her
in
earnest
converse
with
a
american
missionary
whom
in
introducing
jack
to
him
she
called
sandeman
then
she
said
to
jack
i
want
you
very
much
grayson
baron
vartonian
is
in
there
glancing
at
the
door
of
an
inner
room
he
came
with
sandeman
he
has
just
heard
that
of
all
his
large
family
there
remains
to
him
now
not
one
you
know
more
about
them
than
any
one
else
who
is
living
now
save
gabriel
will
you
go
in
and
speak
to
him
and
comfort
him
if
you
can
though
his
heart
fainted
within
him
at
the
thought
of
such
a
sorrow
jack
went
into
the
inner
room
there
were
two
persons
there
old
baron
vartonian
sat
on
the
divan
his
head
bowed
down
upon
both
his
hands
his
face
hidden
now
and
then
the
sound
of
low
deep
moans
such
moans
as
only
come
from
a
strong
man
deepest
heart
broke
the
stillness
beside
him
stood
a
young
man
with
a
face
incredibly
pale
and
worn
and
wasted
as
if
with
some
great
agony
though
its
look
was
one
of
past
rather
than
of
present
suffering
the
look
of
one
that
had
travailed
sore
but
whose
pangs
were
ended
now
his
hand
was
laid
tenderly
and
with
a
caressing
touch
on
the
old
shoulder
for
that
was
all
the
human
sympathy
he
was
able
to
bear
just
yet
he
motioned
jack
to
sit
on
the
divan
you
were
their
friend
you
loved
them
he
said
and
received
from
them
much
kindness
jack
answered
in
a
low
voice
after
a
pause
he
went
on
she
that
was
dearer
to
me
than
my
life
was
as
a
child
in
their
house
it
was
they
who
brought
her
to
the
mission
school
where
such
joy
and
help
were
given
her
why
do
i
live
the
old
man
broke
out
suddenly
it
is
wrong
it
is
horrible
it
is
against
nature
no
reaper
reaps
the
green
and
leaves
the
ripe
no
gardener
leaves
the
dry
stick
in
the
ground
and
uproots
the
flourishing
tree
i
am
alone
alone
alone
i
came
back
after
all
those
long
months
of
suffering
thinking
i
will
rest
now
i
will
end
my
days
in
my
home
with
my
dear
ones
my
son
my
firstborn
shall
close
my
eyes
and
my
children
and
my
children
children
shall
lay
me
in
the
grave
and
i
find
all
gone
sons
and
sons
sons
with
the
mothers
and
the
children
and
the
children
children
even
the
little
babe
i
had
never
seen
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
then
letting
his
hands
fall
and
looking
at
the
two
who
stood
beside
him
but
i
do
not
believe
it
it
is
not
possible
surely
at
least
is
left
alive
let
us
go
and
see
the
young
man
rose
also
it
were
best
for
us
to
bring
him
to
his
own
house
he
said
to
jack
perhaps
when
he
sees
it
he
will
be
able
to
weep
so
jack
went
for
the
second
time
to
the
house
of
the
vartonians
the
old
man
burdened
with
a
weight
of
sorrow
nature
seemed
scarce
able
to
bear
asked
them
after
a
while
to
leave
him
in
the
family
which
had
been
the
centre
of
his
home
while
he
sat
there
alone
with
his
memories
and
his
god
the
two
young
men
waited
together
in
the
court
jack
found
that
his
companion
was
a
theological
student
almost
ready
for
the
ministry
to
which
he
had
been
looking
forward
with
eager
hope
when
one
day
he
was
suddenly
seized
by
zaptiehs
and
flung
into
a
dungeon
sandeman
who
was
to
him
as
a
father
young
mardiros
vahanian
said
with
kindling
eyes
had
done
all
in
his
power
to
help
him
or
even
to
find
out
of
what
he
was
accused
at
last
it
was
discovered
that
another
person
had
been
arrested
upon
whom
there
was
found
an
english
newspaper
containing
a
notice
of
the
massacre
at
sassoun
this
man
probably
under
torture
said
that
he
had
it
from
young
vahanian
and
that
was
all
his
crime
on
one
occasion
sandeman
got
leave
to
visit
him
though
he
only
saw
him
in
the
presence
of
turks
and
was
only
allowed
to
speak
to
him
in
turkish
as
they
parted
he
ventured
to
whisper
in
english
just
this
do
not
give
up
hope
and
terrible
things
had
the
poor
lad
suffered
afterwards
on
account
of
this
one
word
not
then
and
not
at
any
time
from
his
own
lips
did
jack
hear
the
true
story
of
that
prison
year
heaped
with
agonies
with
tortures
and
with
outrages
to
us
happily
inconceivable
during
a
short
time
towards
the
end
he
had
shared
the
cell
of
baron
vartonian
who
also
had
been
imprisoned
on
some
futile
charge
a
strong
friendship
had
grown
up
between
the
young
man
and
the
old
thus
thrown
together
and
now
in
the
old
man
utter
loneliness
and
desolation
vahanian
wished
to
take
the
place
of
a
son
and
to
cherish
and
comfort
him
jack
could
not
help
doubting
when
he
looked
at
him
that
he
would
be
long
left
in
the
world
to
comfort
any
one
but
not
liking
to
express
his
doubt
he
asked
him
how
it
was
that
in
the
end
he
got
out
of
prison
i
do
not
very
well
know
the
young
man
answered
sandeman
never
ceased
to
work
for
me
and
i
think
that
somehow
he
got
the
british
consul
interested
in
my
case
and
that
he
interceded
for
me
as
i
know
he
did
for
baron
vartonian
against
whom
indeed
there
was
no
charge
that
the
turks
themselves
believed
in
it
was
one
of
those
false
accusations
that
any
man
can
get
a
turk
to
bring
against
a
christian
for
a
couple
of
medjids
and
the
hiring
of
two
false
witnesses
to
back
him
up
and
christians
being
disqualified
from
bearing
witness
in
a
court
of
law
the
accused
of
course
has
no
chance
of
proving
his
innocence
however
thanks
i
suppose
to
the
consul
baron
vartonian
was
released
and
so
was
i
jack
asked
him
if
he
thought
he
was
recovering
his
health
oh
yes
i
grow
stronger
every
day
if
you
had
seen
me
when
i
first
came
out
of
prison
you
would
wonder
at
the
change
so
he
said
but
jack
wondered
instead
what
he
could
possibly
have
looked
like
then
no
doubt
he
said
while
you
were
in
prison
you
often
wished
to
die
i
did
he
answered
his
eyes
kindling
not
that
i
might
be
away
from
my
pain
but
that
i
might
be
with
my
saviour
but
for
the
most
part
i
felt
him
so
near
me
there
that
i
thought
death
itself
could
scarcely
bring
us
any
closer
jack
look
softened
in
spite
of
all
your
suffering
i
call
you
blessed
he
said
in
a
low
voice
still
after
all
that
was
knowing
him
by
faith
in
heaven
it
will
be
sight
which
will
be
different
and
be
better
though
it
is
hard
to
see
how
it
can
i
thought
i
knew
something
before
of
the
mystery
of
communion
with
him
but
i
felt
as
if
i
had
never
tasted
it
till
then
i
did
not
know
there
could
be
such
peace
such
joy
has
it
stayed
with
you
since
you
came
out
no
and
yes
when
a
child
is
hurt
the
mother
takes
it
in
her
arms
and
fondles
it
when
it
is
well
she
lets
it
run
by
her
side
but
she
does
not
love
it
the
less
perhaps
it
seems
strange
to
you
now
to
come
back
to
life
perhaps
you
would
rather
not
i
would
rather
die
you
think
and
go
to
him
not
just
yet
there
are
too
many
in
the
world
that
he
wants
me
to
help
like
these
poor
people
here
who
have
suffered
so
much
yes
but
there
are
those
more
worthy
of
our
pity
than
even
they
worthy
truly
on
god
earth
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
none
but
i
know
what
you
mean
jack
added
in
a
lower
voice
you
are
thinking
of
those
in
harems
or
elsewhere
for
whom
we
only
dare
to
ask
one
thing
vahanian
face
grew
sad
it
was
some
moments
before
he
spoke
again
at
last
he
said
there
are
those
still
more
pitiable
no
man
has
compassion
no
man
cares
for
the
soul
of
the
turk
jack
started
as
if
he
had
been
shot
how
we
he
asked
yet
you
say
every
day
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
them
that
trespass
against
us
i
never
thought
of
it
in
that
way
and
i
tell
you
if
i
ever
get
back
to
england
i
will
forgive
the
turk
i
will
keep
silence
about
his
evil
deeds
about
the
things
i
have
seen
and
heard
of
here
nor
should
you
to
stop
them
would
be
to
show
the
very
kindness
of
god
even
to
the
turk
himself
but
i
would
it
were
god
will
to
stop
them
not
with
his
wrath
but
with
his
love
how
could
that
be
as
he
stopped
paul
do
you
not
believe
christ
died
for
the
turk
as
well
as
for
the
christian
he
died
for
all
jack
said
reverently
and
i
know
he
commands
us
to
forgive
but
this
thing
is
not
possible
to
man
and
yet
it
is
strange
but
i
remember
that
when
i
was
led
out
to
die
as
i
thought
by
their
hands
i
felt
no
anger
against
them
indeed
i
scarcely
thought
of
them
at
all
yet
afterwards
when
i
knew
they
had
done
i
could
have
torn
them
limb
from
limb
friend
you
suffered
more
than
i
because
you
suffered
in
others
it
is
only
written
they
revile
persecute
but
am
i
to
think
god
has
no
better
thing
for
you
than
what
he
gave
me
because
i
have
had
a
few
drops
of
this
wine
of
his
of
which
he
drank
himself
am
i
to
doubt
that
he
can
fill
the
cup
for
you
even
to
the
brim
it
is
for
our
sorest
needs
that
he
keeps
his
best
cordials
and
now
i
will
go
back
again
to
my
friend
baron
vartonian
i
think
he
has
been
long
enough
alone
he
went
and
jack
looked
after
him
wondering
and
learning
a
new
lesson
of
what
christ
can
do
for
his
suffering
servants
this
is
no
fiction
it
is
literal
truth
except
indeed
that
these
poor
words
fail
to
convey
the
depth
and
intensity
of
the
pitying
love
which
divine
grace
had
kindled
in
that
young
heart
for
those
at
whose
hands
he
had
suffered
such
things
chapter
xxiii
betrothal
now
with
fainting
frame
with
soul
just
lingering
on
the
flight
begun
to
bind
for
thee
its
last
dim
thoughts
in
one
i
bless
thee
miss
celandine
thoughtful
kindness
had
screened
off
a
little
corner
in
the
crowded
church
hospital
where
gabriel
bed
was
placed
and
there
was
room
for
kevork
and
john
grayson
to
sit
beside
him
when
they
could
elmas
also
came
often
to
see
him
when
kevork
first
returned
he
had
brightened
up
so
wonderfully
that
the
restored
brother
hoped
they
might
be
left
together
but
there
was
no
real
return
of
strength
and
the
temporary
excitement
ended
in
a
reaction
that
meant
increased
weakness
and
suffering
yet
neither
jack
nor
kevork
wished
to
face
the
truth
they
both
especially
kevork
clung
to
that
frail
young
life
tenaciously
desperately
one
day
not
long
after
the
arrival
of
sandeman
jack
drew
aside
the
curtain
and
came
in
kevork
was
there
already
and
made
room
for
him
to
sit
down
a
smile
passed
over
the
sick
boy
wasted
face
but
it
was
soon
succeeded
by
an
anxious
troubled
look
yon
effendi
he
said
you
are
grieved
what
is
it
jack
smiled
too
oh
gabriel
those
fingers
of
yours
he
said
there
is
no
escaping
them
it
was
a
saying
amongst
them
that
gabriel
whose
hands
were
useless
had
been
given
fingers
in
his
heart
instead
for
if
there
was
any
special
sorrow
or
need
he
always
knew
it
by
some
instinct
and
figuratively
speaking
put
his
finger
on
the
place
for
now
on
his
own
account
he
had
no
more
grief
no
more
fear
his
heart
was
all
at
leisure
from
itself
for
the
griefs
of
others
he
smiled
again
in
answer
and
not
sadly
at
all
my
fingers
touch
a
trouble
of
yours
which
yet
is
not
all
a
trouble
he
said
you
have
been
talking
to
the
american
badvellie
yes
and
to
miss
celandine
and
they
both
advise
me
to
go
home
kevork
turned
a
startled
face
to
him
but
there
is
no
use
in
thinking
of
it
he
said
quickly
they
would
not
give
you
a
passport
after
what
you
have
done
that
is
just
what
said
there
is
no
blood
upon
my
conscience
but
upon
my
hand
there
is
blood
enough
were
i
to
apply
as
things
are
now
for
a
passport
my
antecedents
would
be
looked
into
and
i
should
never
be
allowed
to
leave
this
land
alive
they
would
never
kill
an
englishman
said
gabriel
not
openly
in
broad
daylight
but
in
one
way
or
another
i
should
disappear
so
i
think
said
kevork
eagerly
you
must
run
no
such
risks
as
that
my
brother
sandeman
has
a
different
plan
jack
said
that
fine
young
fellow
vahanian
wants
to
stay
here
to
be
with
baron
vartonian
and
to
help
among
the
wounded
what
if
i
took
his
passport
and
went
to
aleppo
in
his
place
you
would
be
found
out
the
doctor
thinks
not
he
almost
undertakes
to
put
me
safely
through
i
can
dye
my
hair
and
stain
my
face
a
little
not
much
will
be
needed
so
well
your
suns
have
browned
me
then
yon
effendi
your
mind
is
to
leave
us
kevork
said
sorrowfully
almost
bitterly
my
mind
is
to
leave
you
jack
answered
only
i
want
to
know
which
thing
is
right
to
do
he
looked
tenderly
at
gabriel
as
he
added
a
while
ago
i
could
not
have
gone
i
could
not
have
left
you
alone
gabriel
but
now
you
have
kevork
god
has
given
him
back
to
you
from
the
dead
god
has
given
kevork
to
me
gabriel
said
but
what
is
he
going
to
give
kevork
for
you
know
i
can
not
stay
with
him
do
speak
that
way
jack
said
hastily
kevork
was
more
visibly
overcome
i
can
not
go
on
alone
he
said
i
gabriel
you
must
not
go
gabriel
was
much
worse
that
night
and
early
in
the
morning
jack
went
for
kevork
whose
sleeping
place
was
in
another
part
of
the
crowded
mission
premises
come
quickly
he
said
i
think
he
is
going
from
us
kevork
sprang
up
from
his
mat
threw
a
jacket
over
his
zeboun
and
choking
down
a
sob
followed
his
friend
in
silence
the
sweet
morning
air
which
had
the
touch
and
thrill
of
the
springtime
in
it
fanned
their
brows
as
they
crossed
over
to
the
church
where
gabriel
lay
who
is
with
him
kevork
asked
anna
hanum
she
was
kneeling
beside
the
dying
boy
and
as
they
entered
looked
up
with
her
calm
sweet
face
he
is
easier
now
she
said
you
will
try
to
be
glad
for
me
will
you
not
gabriel
whispered
you
know
it
is
best
you
will
soon
be
with
them
all
your
father
and
mother
and
my
shushan
jack
answered
i
shall
be
with
christ
gabriel
said
for
whom
you
have
given
your
life
who
gave
his
life
for
me
but
his
dark
wistful
eyes
turned
away
even
from
the
beloved
yon
effendi
to
rest
upon
his
brother
face
there
is
some
one
else
i
want
to
see
he
murmured
stoop
down
anna
hanum
he
whispered
a
name
into
her
ear
she
said
yes
dear
and
glided
softly
away
it
is
miss
celandine
he
wants
both
the
young
men
thought
jack
took
the
place
beside
him
he
lay
still
with
closed
eyes
resting
only
once
he
opened
them
when
a
moan
from
the
crowded
space
outside
was
heard
through
the
curtain
some
one
is
suffering
yon
effendi
he
said
please
go
and
help
kevork
was
left
with
him
alone
his
tears
falling
without
restraint
kevork
he
whispered
there
is
comfort
coming
for
you
jack
returned
presently
miss
celandine
who
had
been
sent
for
came
in
also
and
with
her
elmas
stepanian
at
the
sight
of
the
beloved
teacher
gabriel
tried
to
raise
himself
but
it
was
more
than
he
could
do
he
looked
at
her
appealingly
the
hand
that
has
saved
us
all
to
my
lips
once
more
he
prayed
instead
of
giving
him
her
hand
she
stooped
down
and
kissed
him
lip
to
lip
and
motioned
to
elmas
to
do
the
same
in
face
he
looked
earnestly
while
he
gathered
all
his
remaining
strength
to
speak
oriort
elmas
kevork
has
loved
you
ever
since
he
was
at
school
in
aintab
all
the
rest
are
gone
from
him
i
am
going
now
it
is
too
hard
for
him
to
stay
here
alone
will
comfort
him
oriort
elmas
if
i
can
she
answered
soothingly
as
one
speaks
to
the
dying
but
i
want
to
hear
the
promise
on
the
book
before
i
go
she
drew
back
her
face
flushing
crimson
and
looked
at
miss
celandine
in
perplexity
kevork
drew
a
step
nearer
and
spoke
oriort
elmas
it
is
quite
true
though
i
would
not
have
dared
to
say
it
had
not
he
said
it
for
me
for
we
stand
together
in
the
shadow
of
the
grave
but
if
this
dear
lady
who
is
a
mother
to
us
all
will
allow
it
and
you
will
give
me
your
promise
there
is
nothing
man
may
do
his
voice
quivered
and
thrilled
with
suppressed
feeling
nothing
man
may
do
that
i
will
not
do
for
you
and
find
my
joy
in
it
for
i
love
you
more
than
life
elmas
stepanian
character
strong
by
nature
had
been
annealed
in
the
furnace
of
affliction
that
furnace
had
burned
away
the
bonds
of
those
timid
conventions
that
usually
held
the
daughters
of
her
race
in
a
low
but
firm
voice
she
answered
if
miss
celandine
approves
i
will
give
it
jack
was
standing
beside
miss
celandine
he
took
out
his
father
bible
which
he
always
kept
with
him
and
put
it
in
her
hand
with
a
significant
look
from
her
to
kevork
she
understood
the
mute
appeal
if
she
gave
the
book
to
kevork
for
the
purpose
they
all
knew
it
would
be
her
act
of
sanction
to
this
strange
betrothal
she
paused
a
moment
then
she
said
the
god
of
your
fathers
and
your
god
bless
you
both
and
laid
the
book
in
the
outstretched
hand
of
kevork
kevork
gave
it
to
elmas
so
i
plight
my
troth
to
thee
for
good
days
and
evil
for
health
and
sickness
for
life
and
death
and
for
that
which
is
beyond
he
said
and
i
also
to
thee
elmas
answered
now
it
is
all
right
gabriel
said
with
a
look
of
infinite
relief
i
will
tell
them
but
you
are
very
tired
jack
interposed
noting
a
rapid
change
in
his
face
and
turning
to
get
a
cordial
he
was
accustomed
to
give
him
kevork
he
whispered
take
oriort
elmas
away
there
are
too
many
here
said
miss
celandine
i
think
you
had
better
stay
grayson
never
mind
that
cup
he
can
not
take
it
there
followed
a
few
minutes
of
struggle
and
suffering
a
brief
conflict
of
the
spirit
with
the
failing
flesh
it
was
soon
over
once
more
the
look
of
peace
settled
down
on
the
wasted
face
and
now
it
was
for
ever
gabriel
looked
around
and
recognised
them
all
then
in
that
action
so
common
to
the
dying
he
slowly
raised
his
right
arm
and
waved
the
bandaged
helpless
hand
with
his
own
right
hand
and
with
his
holy
arm
hath
he
gotten
himself
the
victory
he
said
with
his
parting
breath
his
brother
closed
his
eyes
and
the
others
mingled
their
tears
with
his
until
at
last
miss
celandine
said
gently
my
children
he
needs
our
care
no
more
and
there
are
many
waiting
without
who
still
need
it
sorely
i
will
go
with
you
and
help
jack
answered
so
they
went
leaving
kevork
and
elmas
kneeling
together
beside
their
dead
chapter
xxiv
under
the
flag
of
england
whose
flag
has
braved
a
thousand
years
the
battle
and
the
breeze
grayson
you
are
young
yet
said
the
venerable
missionary
sandeman
to
the
man
before
him
do
i
young
john
grayson
answered
no
i
am
old
old
the
last
year
has
done
for
me
the
work
of
other
men
three
score
and
ten
i
know
what
you
have
seen
and
suffered
it
has
not
been
suffering
jack
said
i
have
i
have
tasted
the
wine
of
life
as
well
as
the
poison
i
have
loved
and
been
beloved
i
know
the
missionary
said
again
and
he
spoke
the
truth
but
there
are
many
years
before
you
yet
for
them
all
that
love
will
be
a
memory
it
can
not
be
a
memory
jack
interrupted
for
it
is
myself
it
was
far
from
sandeman
thought
to
blaspheme
that
creed
of
youth
which
stamps
the
signet
of
eternity
upon
its
love
its
joy
its
suffering
its
despair
old
as
he
was
his
own
heart
had
kept
too
young
for
that
he
said
when
you
return
to
your
own
land
you
will
find
waiting
for
you
interests
and
pursuits
cares
and
duties
also
which
will
engross
your
energies
and
fill
your
life
not
my
life
jack
answered
when
i
wedded
shushan
i
wedded
her
race
if
indeed
god
calls
you
to
help
in
drying
the
tears
of
this
of
nations
i
can
think
of
no
higher
calling
sandeman
answered
with
emotion
but
for
that
hope
said
jack
do
you
think
i
could
leave
this
place
do
you
think
i
could
abandon
all
these
helpless
sufferers
and
that
heroic
woman
whose
name
a
thousand
times
over
deserves
the
before
it
if
only
we
protestants
had
a
calendar
of
our
own
as
we
ought
but
we
never
could
said
the
missionary
with
a
smile
it
would
need
a
page
for
every
day
however
miss
celandine
herself
is
urging
your
departure
and
things
for
the
present
seem
quieter
jack
added
can
nothing
be
in
this
miserable
land
i
am
glad
vahanian
is
staying
he
will
be
a
great
help
yes
said
the
missionary
and
he
is
glad
to
work
here
for
the
present
though
he
still
keeps
the
dream
and
longing
of
his
heart
and
he
thinks
god
will
fulfil
it
one
day
and
allow
him
to
make
known
the
gospel
of
his
grace
to
the
turks
miss
celandine
is
beginning
to
gather
in
the
orphans
a
few
of
them
poor
destitute
starving
little
ones
did
you
hear
that
baron
vartonian
has
lent
his
house
to
give
them
shelter
no
i
am
glad
to
think
of
the
home
i
knew
being
used
for
such
a
purpose
and
it
will
comfort
his
own
desolate
heart
but
now
for
yourself
grayson
are
you
ready
for
the
journey
yes
returned
jack
with
a
rather
mournful
smile
you
see
i
have
no
packing
to
do
right
the
less
you
carry
the
better
here
is
the
one
treasure
i
bring
back
from
armenia
and
i
have
learned
here
as
perhaps
i
should
never
have
learned
elsewhere
what
a
treasure
it
is
jack
said
producing
his
father
bible
by
right
he
added
it
should
belong
to
oriort
elmas
for
it
is
the
book
of
her
betrothal
but
she
and
kevork
both
say
i
must
take
it
back
on
account
of
its
memories
i
wish
doctor
those
two
could
come
to
england
with
me
with
you
they
can
not
come
but
i
wish
they
could
follow
you
for
kevork
seems
to
have
taken
an
active
share
in
resisting
the
turks
at
the
time
of
the
first
massacre
and
such
things
are
not
forgotten
the
turks
forget
nothing
except
their
promises
said
jack
but
sandeman
there
is
another
matter
which
causes
me
some
embarrassment
i
am
absolutely
without
money
the
fact
is
i
have
been
living
upon
these
poor
people
and
latterly
upon
miss
celandine
sandeman
smiled
i
think
she
would
say
your
services
have
been
worth
more
than
your
morsel
of
bread
and
as
for
your
journey
we
can
take
you
on
without
expense
as
far
as
aleppo
i
am
going
there
you
are
very
good
and
the
cost
at
least
i
can
repay
you
afterwards
but
the
kindness
never
but
i
shall
have
to
get
somehow
from
aleppo
to
alexandretta
and
there
to
take
a
passage
in
the
first
steamer
i
can
find
how
can
all
that
be
managed
when
you
come
to
aleppo
you
shall
tell
your
story
to
the
english
consul
i
have
little
doubt
he
will
provide
for
your
safe
conveyance
to
alexandretta
and
lend
you
the
passage
money
how
shall
i
get
him
to
believe
me
i
should
not
mind
so
much
if
he
were
the
same
i
knew
when
i
passed
through
aleppo
with
my
father
five
years
ago
but
this
is
another
man
he
will
believe
you
the
missionary
said
quietly
he
would
not
speak
of
his
own
influence
for
a
double
reason
it
would
be
boastful
and
it
might
be
dangerous
your
story
bears
all
the
impress
of
truth
and
you
can
prove
it
in
a
hundred
ways
then
my
course
is
plain
jack
said
and
the
first
step
he
added
with
a
sigh
is
to
say
farewell
to
the
dear
friends
here
he
rose
to
go
but
turned
back
to
ask
with
a
little
hesitation
sandeman
have
you
seen
the
cathedral
said
the
missionary
with
a
shudder
after
all
this
time
it
is
still
the
most
sickening
sight
i
have
ever
beheld
not
sight
alone
every
sense
is
outraged
do
not
go
near
it
mr
grayson
and
yet
jack
answered
christ
martyrs
went
to
him
from
thence
john
grayson
journey
in
the
company
of
sandeman
proved
as
little
eventful
as
any
journey
at
that
time
and
in
those
regions
could
possibly
be
one
sad
episode
indeed
there
was
as
usual
they
halted
at
biridjik
they
found
the
town
a
wreck
and
the
houses
in
ruins
many
of
them
burned
others
plundered
and
defaced
the
streets
were
almost
impassable
with
rubbish
broken
glass
fragments
of
furniture
and
other
far
more
ghastly
memorials
of
the
massacre
the
remaining
inhabitants
had
been
forced
to
become
moslems
to
save
their
lives
they
kept
themselves
shut
up
in
their
houses
or
moved
about
pale
attenuated
shadows
with
fear
and
horror
stamped
upon
their
countenances
no
intercourse
was
permitted
between
them
and
the
missionary
party
only
a
few
of
them
dared
to
look
at
the
travellers
with
eyes
of
piteous
appeal
and
recognition
and
to
make
furtively
with
rapid
fingers
the
sign
of
the
cross
jack
longed
to
give
them
word
of
comfort
christ
will
forgive
you
only
you
have
lost
a
grand
opportunity
he
said
this
to
sandeman
who
answered
have
a
right
to
say
that
so
had
he
but
it
seems
to
me
that
no
man
who
has
not
been
tried
thus
can
estimate
the
trial
the
opportunity
or
the
loss
but
oh
the
sadness
of
it
all
jack
said
and
then
these
two
brave
strong
men
of
race
did
just
what
the
exiles
of
israel
did
so
many
ages
ago
by
the
waters
of
babylon
they
sat
down
and
wept
before
they
quitted
biridjik
john
grayson
went
in
the
early
morning
to
visit
his
father
grave
he
was
greatly
relieved
to
find
it
had
been
left
undisturbed
for
he
knew
that
horrible
outrages
had
been
committed
elsewhere
upon
the
graves
of
the
christians
kneeling
on
the
hallowed
spot
he
thanked
god
for
his
father
noble
life
and
bright
example
and
for
sustaining
and
preserving
himself
through
so
many
perils
then
the
thought
came
to
him
as
it
had
done
so
many
times
before
though
never
perhaps
with
such
poignancy
that
other
dust
most
precious
had
no
in
sacred
ground
over
the
grave
of
shushan
none
might
ever
weep
nor
could
any
find
it
until
that
day
when
all
that
are
in
the
graves
shall
hear
the
voice
of
the
son
of
man
bitter
it
seemed
to
john
grayson
that
this
solace
the
right
of
the
humblest
mourner
was
denied
to
him
but
presently
he
rose
from
his
knees
with
the
thrill
of
another
thought
a
new
one
in
his
heart
he
looked
around
him
not
far
could
his
eye
reach
as
he
stood
there
but
the
eyes
of
his
mind
were
ranging
over
the
whole
beautiful
desolated
land
from
trebizond
by
the
northern
sea
to
the
rice
plains
of
adana
in
the
south
my
shushan
has
a
royal
he
said
for
me
all
armenia
is
her
grave
and
as
holding
that
sacred
dust
i
will
love
and
live
for
and
cherish
that
land
all
my
life
long
god
helping
me
throughout
their
whole
route
the
travellers
found
tokens
of
the
ruin
of
the
country
and
the
misery
of
the
people
some
sights
they
saw
are
absolutely
beyond
description
and
would
haunt
them
both
until
the
end
of
their
days
how
long
o
lord
how
long
was
the
word
oftenest
on
sandeman
lips
still
no
man
molested
or
hindered
them
in
any
way
aintab
was
first
reached
then
in
due
time
aleppo
and
john
grayson
found
himself
once
more
amongst
englishmen
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
dead
and
buried
and
brought
to
life
again
in
a
new
world
which
he
had
forgotten
and
which
had
forgotten
him
he
met
however
at
the
consulate
some
who
remembered
his
father
and
once
he
came
to
know
these
his
past
began
to
revive
within
him
at
once
upon
his
arrival
he
wrote
to
his
friends
in
england
but
he
did
not
think
there
would
be
time
for
an
answer
to
come
before
he
left
the
consul
although
personally
a
stranger
was
very
kind
which
did
him
the
more
credit
since
he
thought
at
first
there
was
something
curious
and
unusual
about
this
young
englishman
with
the
grey
hair
and
the
sad
face
indeed
he
asked
sandeman
privately
if
grayson
was
entirely
in
his
right
mind
once
reassured
on
this
point
he
gave
him
most
efficient
help
he
got
him
a
passport
advanced
him
the
necessary
money
and
sent
a
competent
and
faithful
dragoman
and
a
couple
of
kavasses
with
him
to
alexandretta
with
orders
not
to
leave
him
until
they
saw
him
safely
on
board
a
vessel
going
to
england
with
a
sense
of
almost
bewildering
strangeness
and
wonder
jack
stood
at
last
on
the
deck
of
the
great
steamship
bound
for
southampton
he
watched
the
crowds
about
him
sailors
preparing
for
the
start
passengers
getting
on
board
with
much
stir
and
bustle
they
had
to
come
in
boats
and
there
was
quite
a
little
fleet
of
these
about
the
companion
ladder
the
rowers
shouting
and
screaming
as
each
tried
to
get
his
own
craft
in
first
the
dragoman
had
told
jack
that
all
the
franks
stopped
at
this
place
and
went
on
shore
to
visit
the
spot
where
a
battle
was
fought
long
ago
by
alexander
the
great
the
battle
of
issus
that
was
what
they
called
it
an
official
stood
at
the
ship
side
examining
the
passport
of
every
passenger
who
came
on
board
near
him
stood
the
captain
a
rough
british
seaman
there
was
great
hurry
crowding
and
confusion
and
it
was
very
evident
the
passport
business
was
not
done
as
thoroughly
as
it
might
have
been
it
was
not
difficult
for
a
passportless
person
or
even
two
or
three
to
slip
in
unbeknownst
as
he
heard
the
an
irishman
remarking
casually
to
a
friend
jack
edged
himself
out
of
the
crowd
and
watched
presently
he
saw
a
boat
filled
with
zaptiehs
well
he
knew
their
hateful
uniform
put
off
from
the
shore
and
make
for
the
ships
in
the
bay
it
might
be
the
they
meant
it
might
be
one
of
the
others
jack
knew
his
passport
was
all
in
order
still
he
did
not
like
that
sight
he
could
not
realize
yet
that
he
was
out
of
turkey
that
he
stood
on
the
deck
of
a
british
ship
and
that
the
glorious
flag
of
old
england
was
waving
above
his
head
so
he
went
quietly
downstairs
to
the
cabin
resolved
to
stay
there
until
the
good
ship
should
be
actually
on
her
way
meanwhile
the
turkish
boat
came
on
apace
and
before
it
faster
still
flew
another
little
boat
a
young
man
standing
up
in
it
sprang
on
the
companion
ladder
just
about
to
be
withdrawn
and
ran
up
leaving
a
girl
and
a
boy
in
the
boat
too
late
my
man
said
the
captain
waving
him
back
oh
sir
take
us
the
young
man
cried
he
was
trembling
and
his
face
white
with
terror
take
us
we
will
pay
i
ca
we
have
no
more
room
we
will
pay
you
well
ten
pounds
no
our
second
cabin
is
full
and
we
are
off
now
fifteen
pounds
no
not
for
twenty
pounds
for
pity
sake
we
are
armenians
fleeing
for
our
lives
you
armenians
are
all
rogues
said
the
captain
no
is
no
and
he
turned
away
for
christ
sake
then
cried
the
young
man
in
an
agony
the
captain
turned
back
again
why
did
you
not
say
that
before
he
asked
in
an
altered
voice
i
am
a
christian
man
and
i
can
not
refuse
plea
thank
god
the
young
man
almost
in
less
than
a
minute
more
the
boy
and
girl
were
helped
up
the
ladder
by
willing
hands
and
all
three
stood
together
on
the
deck
then
the
great
heart
of
the
ship
began
to
throb
and
she
was
soon
steaming
merrily
out
of
the
harbour
john
grayson
came
on
deck
again
and
seeing
three
armenians
standing
by
the
side
of
the
vessel
drew
near
laid
his
hand
on
the
young
shoulder
and
looked
him
in
the
face
kaspar
hohanian
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
is
it
possible
this
is
you
kaspar
seemed
scarcely
able
to
speak
even
yet
but
he
drew
a
long
breath
tried
to
compose
himself
and
returned
jack
look
of
inquiry
who
are
you
he
asked
do
you
not
know
me
do
you
not
remember
our
awful
week
together
in
the
prison
at
urfa
expecting
death
i
am
john
grayson
with
that
white
hair
i
thought
you
were
dead
so
i
thought
of
you
and
with
more
reason
i
thought
all
the
band
who
watched
and
prayed
together
through
those
sad
days
were
gone
to
god
save
me
for
a
moment
both
were
silent
jack
did
not
care
until
he
knew
more
to
look
again
in
the
face
of
his
friend
he
could
not
but
remember
there
was
only
way
of
escape
for
any
of
that
devoted
group
kaspar
divined
his
thought
and
said
no
i
have
not
denied
the
faith
though
if
the
same
trial
came
again
i
dare
not
answer
for
myself
strangely
enough
grayson
it
was
through
you
my
life
was
saved
how
could
that
be
i
will
tell
you
when
i
find
my
sister
a
place
to
rest
in
the
young
lady
is
your
sister
may
i
but
the
captain
came
up
just
then
interrupting
them
come
along
he
said
to
kaspar
with
rough
kindliness
i
will
find
a
place
to
stow
you
in
do
be
afraid
young
lady
then
to
the
boy
run
along
my
boy
to
that
ladder
you
see
leading
down
below
but
the
lad
stood
motionless
his
large
brown
eyes
staring
vaguely
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
he
is
blind
sir
kaspar
explained
during
the
massacre
he
hid
in
a
dry
well
he
was
there
several
hours
and
came
out
stone
blind
from
the
terror
poor
boy
well
come
along
with
me
all
of
you
the
ladies
will
make
room
for
your
sister
among
them
and
captain
jack
interposed
the
boy
can
have
my
berth
this
young
man
and
i
who
are
old
friends
can
sleep
on
the
deck
together
the
captain
agreed
he
was
heard
to
remark
afterwards
that
he
thought
armenians
were
all
savages
but
these
people
seemed
just
like
ourselves
at
night
under
the
stars
jack
and
kaspar
resumed
their
conversation
they
were
very
comfortable
the
irish
steward
brought
them
rugs
and
cushions
and
lingered
to
say
he
was
glad
the
gentlemen
and
the
young
lady
had
got
away
from
thim
murtherin
brutes
of
turks
i
was
in
constantinople
last
september
said
he
and
by
the
powers
oliver
cromwell
himself
was
a
thrifle
to
thim
and
i
wish
we
had
oliver
cromwell
here
to
deal
with
them
now
jack
said
with
juster
views
of
history
the
great
ship
was
ploughing
easily
and
steadily
through
calm
waters
all
around
and
all
about
them
reigned
sleep
and
rest
it
was
a
good
time
to
talk
of
past
perils
and
to
enjoy
present
security
how
could
you
say
your
life
was
saved
through
me
john
grayson
asked
i
must
tell
you
first
why
i
was
not
killed
with
the
rest
answered
kaspar
that
was
horrible
all
the
rest
were
dead
even
thomassian
but
they
took
me
back
again
to
the
prison
there
they
brought
me
a
paper
to
sign
setting
forth
that
the
men
who
had
been
executed
were
convicted
of
a
plot
to
attack
the
mosques
and
murder
the
moslems
at
their
service
on
friday
if
i
signed
they
promised
me
life
and
without
the
condition
of
renouncing
my
faith
and
you
was
i
going
to
take
the
crown
from
the
heads
of
the
martyrs
of
god
and
fling
it
down
to
the
dust
to
be
trampled
on
like
that
they
urged
me
arguing
that
these
men
were
all
dead
so
that
nothing
i
could
say
or
sign
could
do
them
any
harm
whereas
if
i
refused
they
the
turks
could
do
me
a
great
deal
of
harm
which
was
certainly
true
and
then
then
i
down
into
do
not
ask
me
more
i
was
praying
every
hour
for
death
when
to
my
amazement
they
came
to
me
not
with
fresh
tortures
but
with
meat
and
drink
good
clothes
la
and
the
offer
of
a
bath
i
was
wondering
what
strange
form
of
mockery
or
torture
their
imaginations
had
got
hold
of
to
which
this
might
be
the
prelude
when
they
explained
to
me
that
you
the
englishman
had
made
your
escape
and
that
just
after
they
discovered
this
the
pasha
had
sent
orders
for
you
to
be
brought
to
him
and
would
be
very
angry
and
accuse
them
of
great
negligence
when
he
found
you
were
not
forthcoming
they
knew
i
spoke
english
and
they
offered
me
my
pardon
if
i
would
personate
you
for
the
time
thinking
i
suppose
that
being
rather
tall
and
of
fairer
complexion
than
most
of
us
i
would
look
the
part
tolerably
well
so
i
was
brought
into
a
light
comfortable
room
and
for
three
or
four
days
very
well
treated
it
was
during
that
time
i
heard
of
the
massacre
at
last
i
was
set
free
how
it
came
about
i
do
not
quite
understand
and
i
suppose
i
never
shall
i
suspect
however
that
the
pasha
never
sent
for
me
having
so
much
else
at
that
time
to
occupy
him
but
that
instead
he
sent
orders
that
the
englishman
was
to
be
quietly
set
free
without
noise
or
stir
and
he
may
have
directed
his
messenger
to
see
the
orders
carried
out
else
might
they
not
have
let
me
go
so
easily
did
you
try
to
go
back
to
your
home
he
bowed
his
head
my
two
elder
brothers
and
my
little
sister
all
dead
artin
hid
in
the
well
in
our
yard
to
come
out
blind
as
you
see
and
to
wander
about
in
darkness
and
misery
escaping
death
by
a
miracle
i
found
him
starving
and
almost
out
of
his
mind
and
your
sister
markeret
through
the
brave
kindness
of
two
aged
women
friends
of
our
family
she
was
saved
if
any
had
a
chance
of
escape
it
was
such
old
women
who
were
thought
neither
worth
the
killing
nor
the
taking
they
spread
a
rug
over
her
and
actually
upon
her
all
through
the
killing
time
the
turks
came
in
often
searched
the
house
and
stole
or
destroyed
what
they
found
but
happily
they
did
no
worse
you
can
imagine
the
distress
of
body
and
the
agony
of
mind
of
those
endless
hours
when
things
seemed
a
little
safer
they
took
her
out
half
dead
and
concealed
her
in
their
but
i
do
not
think
the
look
of
fear
will
ever
leave
her
face
it
is
stamped
there
jack
thought
it
was
on
his
own
as
well
but
to
have
made
your
way
down
here
from
urfa
with
those
two
was
a
perfect
wonder
he
said
how
did
you
do
it
i
had
help
i
told
you
of
the
turk
our
acquaintance
who
tried
to
save
me
before
i
went
to
him
with
my
tale
of
misery
he
promised
to
help
me
and
he
did
he
took
into
counsel
a
friend
of
his
one
osman
effendi
whom
you
know
together
they
managed
matters
so
well
for
us
that
after
many
difficulties
too
long
to
tell
of
we
came
safely
to
alexandretta
there
we
mingled
with
the
crowds
who
were
making
holiday
in
the
plain
of
issus
and
tried
to
slip
with
them
on
board
the
steamer
but
the
zaptiehs
were
after
us
can
i
help
you
when
we
come
to
england
jack
asked
no
doubt
and
i
shall
be
thankful
but
at
first
we
have
friends
to
go
to
a
brother
of
my
mother
went
long
ago
to
a
place
they
call
to
trade
in
turkish
goods
he
will
receive
us
i
am
sure
the
gold
coins
markeret
has
about
her
will
pay
our
passage
and
leave
something
over
to
bring
us
there
come
to
me
for
whatever
you
want
john
grayson
said
cordially
kaspar
thanked
him
and
dropped
into
silence
his
face
showed
excessive
weariness
and
all
the
more
plainly
because
of
the
reaction
from
extreme
terror
however
he
roused
himself
to
say
i
want
to
tell
you
something
rather
odd
one
day
osman
shut
me
up
for
safety
in
his
private
room
i
saw
a
book
lying
there
and
noticing
that
the
characters
were
arabic
i
took
it
up
to
look
it
was
a
bible
in
turkish
he
came
in
and
found
me
reading
it
he
said
to
me
with
a
kind
of
carelessness
that
i
think
hid
some
real
feeling
i
got
a
loan
of
that
i
wanted
to
find
out
the
secret
of
your
people
patience
under
all
that
has
come
upon
them
i
asked
if
he
had
found
it
he
answered
me
think
i
have
it
is
the
spirit
of
hesoos
your
prophet
he
was
like
that
oh
i
am
very
tired
well
then
my
friend
lie
down
here
under
the
stars
and
think
that
now
no
enemy
hand
can
touch
you
or
your
brother
or
your
sister
any
more
sleep
safe
under
the
flag
of
england
the
dear
old

at

how
soon
a
smile
of
god
can
change
the
world
how
we
are
made
for
happiness
how
work
grows
play
adversity
a
winning
fight
it
was
a
bright
july
morning
after
a
prosperous
voyage
the
was
steaming
in
to
southampton
pier
john
grayson
stood
on
the
deck
looking
at
the
shores
of
the
native
land
he
had
never
hoped
to
see
again
near
him
though
not
speaking
stood
kaspar
hohanian
and
a
little
behind
them
artin
and
markeret
sat
together
the
sister
telling
her
blind
brother
all
she
saw
the
three
had
just
been
thanking
the
captain
with
full
hearts
for
many
kindnesses
shown
them
during
the
voyage
presently
the
throbbing
pulses
of
the
ocean
monster
sank
into
stillness
the
double
gangway
was
laid
across
and
then
ensued
a
frantic
rush
of
eager
passengers
laden
with
every
description
of
the
luggage
called
by
courtesy
light
others
stood
on
guard
beside
their
boxes
or
shouted
to
the
porters
who
were
rushing
still
more
frantically
the
other
way
along
with
the
porters
came
a
tall
athletic
young
parson
in
a
soft
felt
hat
and
clerical
undress
with
alert
and
cheerful
aspect
he
went
about
among
the
groups
looking
earnestly
at
all
the
men
in
evident
search
for
some
one
he
bestowed
a
rapid
glance
upon
kaspar
hohanian
but
turned
away
disappointed
then
he
almost
flung
himself
upon
john
grayson
only
to
draw
off
again
instantly
much
disconcerted
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
jack
looked
him
in
the
face
it
was
a
good
face
and
a
strong
face
too
frank
manly
trustful
and
trustworthy
the
young
man
complexion
naturally
fair
was
well
bronzed
by
air
and
exercise
his
eyes
were
english
blue
his
hair
and
beard
light
brown
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
to
jack
with
the
slight
respectful
inflection
of
tone
a
young
man
uses
to
an
elder
i
mistook
you
for
a
cousin
who
is
on
board
and
whom
i
have
come
to
meet
may
i
ask
the
name
john
grayson
we
have
not
met
since
we
were
both
schoolboys
so
you
see
i
am
a
little
puzzled
fred
fred
pangbourne
do
you
know
me
cried
jack
springing
forward
and
seizing
both
his
hands
i
i
could
not
have
believed
it
fred
ejaculated
my
poor
jack
what
have
they
done
with
you
question
could
not
be
answered
in
a
breath
how
is
your
father
how
is
every
one
jack
queried
evading
it
ah
so
you
did
not
get
our
letters
and
have
heard
nothing
my
father
went
from
us
years
ago
the
rest
of
us
are
quite
well
now
you
are
coming
with
me
right
away
to
gladescourt
to
where
my
curacy
at
present
indeed
i
may
call
it
my
rectory
since
in
the
rector
absence
i
live
in
his
house
where
is
your
luggage
in
this
handbag
fred
looked
surprised
but
only
said
let
us
come
at
once
then
stay
fred
i
must
look
after
my
friends
he
turned
to
them
and
spoke
in
armenian
kaspar
take
care
of
your
sister
i
will
look
after
artin
fred
wondered
who
these
people
could
be
but
was
too
courteous
not
to
offer
his
services
he
thought
the
girl
remarkably
pretty
but
felt
provoked
at
the
boy
passivity
and
want
of
interest
in
everything
until
jack
whispered
he
is
blind
a
few
words
in
the
strange
tongue
were
exchanged
with
them
then
jack
enquired
do
you
know
about
the
trains
to
manchester
fred
can
my
friends
get
there
oh
i
dare
say
i
will
find
out
but
come
on
shore
now
i
have
ordered
breakfast
at
the
hotel
and
he
added
in
the
warmth
of
his
heart
will
you
ask
your
friends
to
come
with
us
you
can
ask
them
yourself
said
jack
smiling
they
speak
english
kaspar
very
well
the
others
a
little
then
he
duly
introduced
his
friend
baron
kaspar
hohanian
to
his
cousin
the
rev
frederick
pangbourne
a
couple
of
hours
later
the
three
armenians
were
safely
deposited
in
the
train
for
london
with
full
instructions
how
to
change
when
they
got
there
to
the
northern
line
while
jack
and
his
cousin
were
rolling
swiftly
in
a
different
direction
conversation
as
usual
in
such
cases
was
intermittent
incoherent
dealing
with
trifles
near
at
hand
rather
than
with
the
great
things
each
had
to
tell
the
other
those
armenians
astonish
me
fred
remarked
their
manners
are
perfect
they
might
take
their
places
with
credit
in
any
london
but
then
i
suppose
they
are
of
the
highest
rank
in
their
own
country
you
called
the
young
man
oh
that
is
nothing
baron
only
means
but
i
really
think
fred
from
what
i
heard
on
board
that
the
english
fancy
the
armenians
are
a
kind
of
savages
they
are
a
highly
refined
and
intellectual
race
with
a
civilization
older
than
our
own
and
a
very
copious
and
interesting
literature
but
what
a
wreck
your
friend
looks
has
he
just
come
out
of
a
great
illness
he
has
come
out
of
what
is
infinitely
worse
a
turkish
prison
but
fred
there
are
a
thousand
things
i
want
to
know
my
poor
uncle
frederick
pangbourne
told
him
in
many
words
what
may
here
be
compressed
into
very
few
when
the
tidings
of
the
death
of
the
two
graysons
came
to
their
friends
at
home
ralph
pangbourne
was
just
dead
and
his
eldest
son
was
lying
dangerously
ill
in
typhoid
fever
young
and
experienced
and
beset
by
many
cares
and
troubles
the
new
squire
on
his
recovery
was
quite
unable
to
investigate
the
story
sent
to
him
by
the
consul
from
aleppo
indeed
no
one
thought
of
doubting
it
though
all
sincerely
regretted
these
near
relatives
left
to
lie
in
unknown
graves
in
that
distant
land
with
none
to
tell
where
we
sleep
had
one
of
the
young
pangbournes
been
free
to
do
it
he
would
gladly
have
made
a
pilgrimage
attractive
besides
for
the
adventure
sake
to
the
far
east
to
find
the
of
his
uncle
and
his
cousin
but
young
ralph
the
squire
was
overwhelmed
with
business
tom
the
second
son
was
in
india
doing
well
in
the
civil
service
and
fred
was
at
cambridge
preparing
for
the
ministry
there
was
another
question
what
of
the
grayson
money
as
it
was
called
in
the
family
it
was
no
secret
that
before
leaving
england
john
grayson
had
made
his
will
bequeathing
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
in
case
of
his
son
death
without
issue
to
his
nephew
and
namesake
john
frederick
pangbourne
but
though
they
assumed
as
a
certain
fact
the
death
of
both
the
father
and
the
son
the
pangbournes
felt
it
would
be
a
difficult
matter
to
prove
it
in
a
court
of
law
fred
the
person
principally
concerned
entreated
his
brothers
to
let
the
matter
rest
at
least
until
the
termination
of
the
seven
years
of
absence
and
silence
which
the
law
accepts
as
equivalent
to
a
proof
of
death
he
had
inwardly
an
intense
repugnance
a
repugnance
he
could
not
account
for
to
himself
to
the
thought
of
touching
the
grayson
money
in
secret
and
unknown
to
all
the
rest
he
cherished
a
fancy
that
his
cousin
might
still
be
found
among
the
living
when
jack
letter
arrived
from
aleppo
he
exulted
openly
and
heartily
a
which
followed
it
having
informed
him
that
jack
was
to
sail
in
the
he
watched
daily
for
news
of
the
vessel
and
it
was
with
joy
and
gladness
that
he
hastened
down
to
southampton
to
be
the
first
to
welcome
him
on
english
ground
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
carrying
him
off
at
once
to
the
sweet
surrey
rectory
where
his
favourite
sister
lucy
kept
house
for
him
and
shared
the
pleasant
labours
of
the
rural
parish
but
he
was
not
prepared
to
find
instead
of
a
lad
five
years
his
junior
a
worn
broken
man
he
did
not
tell
all
or
nearly
all
this
to
jack
though
he
told
a
great
many
other
things
the
only
reference
indeed
that
he
made
to
money
matters
was
to
say
you
must
run
up
to
town
on
monday
and
see
penn
stamper
they
will
tell
you
all
about
my
uncle
affairs
you
know
jack
you
are
a
rich
man
wo
they
just
have
a
balance
worth
looking
at
to
hand
over
to
you
after
all
these
years
they
got
out
at
a
little
station
and
walked
over
sunny
fields
to
a
private
door
opening
into
a
pleasure
ground
another
minute
brought
them
to
the
rectory
porch
over
which
climbed
a
beautiful
wisteria
the
whole
scene
looked
the
very
picture
of
peace
of
quietness
and
assurance
for
ever
fred
stopped
a
moment
to
point
out
the
spire
of
our
church
which
was
seen
above
the
trees
at
the
far
side
of
the
house
as
they
looked
at
it
a
fair
girl
came
running
down
to
the
door
to
welcome
her
brother
blue
eyes
golden
hair
cheeks
like
a
tinted
coral
lips
and
the
sweetest
of
smiles
made
up
for
jack
a
vision
of
beauty
bewilderingly
new
and
strange
yet
he
only
felt
it
touch
the
surface
of
his
soul
after
dinner
which
was
early
the
two
young
men
walked
about
together
fred
joyously
and
proudly
showing
his
cousin
the
beauties
of
his
home
which
he
said
might
be
his
for
long
enough
as
his
rector
for
special
reasons
was
residing
abroad
it
is
a
home
of
peace
jack
said
old
old
memories
were
coming
to
life
every
moment
the
sound
of
rooks
cawing
in
the
elms
the
velvet
lawn
the
flowers
in
the
trim
parterre
the
very
feel
of
the
air
and
hue
of
the
sunshine
brought
back
those
old
days
when
his
little
feet
had
trotted
over
just
such
velvet
turf
his
little
hand
clinging
to
his
mother
gown
ah
if
were
here
and
his
father
the
father
who
had
been
also
his
hero
brother
comrade
friend
then
a
sweet
thought
brought
sudden
tears
to
his
eyes
surely
the
angels
would
see
to
it
that
shushan
found
them
out
his
heart
bruised
and
sore
with
longings
for
what
might
have
been
grew
still
his
lily
had
a
fairer
home
than
this
over
the
river
where
the
fields
are
green
the
cousins
went
back
to
the
house
lucy
poured
out
tea
for
them
and
asked
jack
lightly
and
prettily
many
questions
about
the
strange
places
he
had
been
in
and
the
strange
things
he
must
have
seen
he
answered
evasively
with
a
reserve
of
manner
which
she
thought
very
odd
until
she
hit
upon
the
explanation
that
this
new
cousin
who
was
so
young
and
looked
so
old
had
been
so
long
amongst
wild
barbarous
people
that
on
his
return
to
civilization
he
was
actually
feeling
she
was
not
sorry
when
fred
took
him
off
to
his
den
as
he
called
his
very
comfortable
and
commodious
study
but
she
said
with
a
pretty
monitorial
air
and
a
careful
eye
to
the
sermon
for
remember
fred
this
is
saturday
night
then
the
real
talk
began
jack
in
writing
from
aleppo
had
simply
told
of
his
father
death
and
added
that
he
himself
had
endured
much
suffering
and
that
he
was
coming
home
to
tell
the
rest
now
he
poured
forth
the
whole
story
into
willing
and
sympathizing
ears
lucy
went
up
to
bed
that
night
wondering
if
fred
and
the
new
cousin
would
ever
stop
talking
and
full
of
anxious
thoughts
about
the
neglected
sermon
as
long
as
she
stayed
awake
she
heard
their
voices
in
the
room
underneath
her
own
and
at
last
she
dropped
asleep
with
the
sermon
still
upon
her
mind
waking
in
the
early
summer
morning
she
heard
steps
in
the
passage
outside
her
door
and
words
spoken
that
seemed
to
echo
her
thoughts
but
your
sermon
i
have
got
it
good
night
or
rather
good
morning
chapter
xxvi
a
sermon
thy
father
hears
the
mighty
cry
of
anguish
and
gives
his
answering
messages
to
thee
brief
sleep
if
any
had
john
grayson
that
sunday
morning
as
so
often
heretofore
he
could
not
sleep
for
pain
or
sorrow
now
he
could
not
sleep
the
sense
of
the
peace
that
was
all
around
him
was
too
new
too
wonderful
he
soon
arose
from
that
fair
english
bed
with
its
pure
linen
smelling
of
lavender
to
wander
out
over
the
dewy
lawn
where
the
morning
sun
touched
everything
with
glory
the
birds
sang
aloud
to
welcome
the
new
day
the
long
long
day
every
hour
of
it
to
be
filled
with
their
innocent
joy
one
blackbird
lighted
on
a
close
to
him
and
sang
they
seemed
to
have
no
fear
in
this
happy
land
fear
did
not
reign
no
doubt
it
was
there
often
for
england
after
all
was
earth
and
not
heaven
but
it
was
a
shadow
lurking
in
dark
places
not
an
eclipse
blotting
out
the
sun
a
presence
darkening
all
the
joy
of
life
but
this
blessed
peace
only
stamped
deeper
upon
jack
heart
the
memory
of
that
far
land
of
agony
and
blood
if
i
forget
thee
o
armenia
he
said
aloud
let
my
right
hand
forget
her
cunning
if
i
do
not
remember
thee
let
my
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
if
i
prefer
not
thee
above
my
chief
joy
my
chief
joy
he
thought
again
lies
buried
there
and
can
never
live
for
me
upon
this
earth
but
by
that
grave
by
that
dead
love
or
rather
by
that
love
that
can
never
die
i
am
pledged
not
to
rest
in
happy
england
but
to
work
for
sad
armenia
and
to
wait
for
my
sabbath
keeping
until
we
keep
it
all
together
in
the
home
above
he
did
not
know
how
long
it
was
before
his
cousin
came
out
to
summon
him
to
their
early
sunday
breakfast
fred
voice
had
lost
the
joyful
ring
it
had
at
their
first
meeting
he
looked
like
a
strong
man
who
had
just
heard
of
a
great
bereavement
lucy
waiting
to
receive
him
in
her
fresh
sunday
dress
with
her
look
of
peace
and
purity
felt
vaguely
that
there
was
sadness
in
the
air
but
her
mind
was
too
full
of
her
class
to
dwell
upon
that
subject
will
you
come
with
us
to
church
fred
asked
his
cousin
jack
looked
surprised
at
the
question
certainly
he
said
why
not
because
i
have
to
say
that
which
will
give
you
pain
yet
i
can
not
forbear
you
have
given
me
my
sermon
for
nevertheless
john
grayson
joined
the
stream
of
fathers
and
mothers
and
little
children
old
men
and
old
women
coming
in
together
while
the
sunday
scholars
took
their
appointed
places
he
looked
round
with
strangely
mingled
feelings
on
the
old
country
church
which
was
without
elaborate
ornament
although
seemly
and
reverent
in
all
its
appointments
as
befitted
a
house
of
god
but
what
most
arrested
him
was
the
fair
white
cloth
on
the
holy
table
showing
that
the
feast
of
the
lord
was
spread
that
day
he
had
never
yet
partaken
of
it
in
the
church
of
his
fathers
but
he
no
more
doubted
his
right
to
come
than
the
child
doubts
his
right
to
sit
down
at
his
father
table
because
it
is
spread
in
a
strange
room
it
was
a
joy
to
look
forward
to
that
it
was
a
joy
meanwhile
to
join
once
more
though
with
trembling
lips
in
the
dear
familiar
prayers
that
sound
like
church
bells
in
the
ears
of
the
english
child
and
now
his
cousin
stood
in
the
pulpit
in
his
aspect
and
bearing
there
was
a
deep
solemnity
which
young
though
he
was
made
him
look
in
truth
as
one
that
pleaded
with
men
he
read
his
text
name
which
is
above
every
and
began
with
an
exposition
of
the
context
lucid
thoughtful
and
evincing
careful
study
jack
thoughts
wandered
from
the
words
to
the
speaker
and
from
the
speaker
to
the
surroundings
once
so
familiar
now
so
unwonted
and
strange
to
him
presently
however
a
word
arrested
him
my
brethren
said
the
preacher
leaning
over
the
pulpit
in
his
earnestness
have
you
ever
thought
what
a
wonderful
thing
is
the
love
of
christ
surely
jack
said
to
himself
if
we
have
ever
thought
of
him
at
all
we
have
thought
of
that
i
do
not
mean
now
the
preacher
went
on
the
love
of
christ
for
us
i
use
of
christ
as
i
use
of
country
of
friends
to
mean
not
theirs
for
us
but
ours
for
them
and
i
say
that
the
love
of
humanity
for
christ
is
a
mystery
only
less
than
the
grand
supreme
mystery
of
all
the
love
of
christ
for
man
and
the
greater
mystery
is
proved
and
illustrated
by
the
less
as
we
may
look
in
its
reflection
on
some
object
too
bright
to
gaze
upon
directly
as
we
may
measure
a
mountain
by
its
shadow
so
may
we
gain
some
faint
conception
of
first
loved
us
by
the
wondering
contemplation
of
how
men
in
all
ages
have
loved
him
consider
the
man
called
christ
jesus
lived
for
three
and
thirty
years
or
less
in
a
little
corner
of
the
world
which
he
never
left
of
those
years
thirty
were
spent
in
silence
and
obscurity
only
for
two
or
three
did
he
flash
into
sudden
fame
soon
cut
short
by
a
violent
death
he
did
not
write
he
did
not
organize
he
did
not
rule
he
only
taught
and
lived
and
loved
yet
what
has
his
name
been
in
the
world
ever
since
what
is
it
in
the
world
you
will
say
is
the
name
of
the
founder
of
our
religion
through
whom
we
approach
the
divine
majesty
and
as
such
we
hold
it
in
reverence
it
is
that
but
to
thousands
upon
thousands
it
is
something
infinitely
more
it
is
the
name
of
their
dearest
most
beloved
and
most
trusted
personal
friend
the
name
of
him
whom
it
is
their
deepest
joy
in
life
to
serve
their
sweetest
hope
in
death
to
see
it
was
the
poet
gift
of
voicing
the
deepest
longings
of
humanity
that
inspired
the
dying
song
we
know
so
well
hope
to
see
my
pilot
face
to
face
when
i
have
crossed
the
bar
there
is
one
test
of
love
usually
accounted
supreme
love
hath
no
man
than
this
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friends
freely
and
joyfully
has
humanity
poured
forth
her
best
blood
for
the
name
of
christ
those
who
have
given
him
this
supreme
proof
of
love
we
call
his
martyrs
or
his
witnesses
other
names
other
religions
other
causes
have
had
their
martyrs
too
indeed
i
think
the
word
is
true
that
all
great
causes
have
their
martyrs
and
i
dare
to
think
too
that
the
wine
of
love
though
we
may
count
it
vainly
spilled
can
not
sink
into
the
earth
beyond
his
power
to
gather
up
who
takes
care
of
lost
things
but
i
think
also
nay
i
know
that
the
martyrs
of
christ
stand
apart
from
all
the
rest
in
their
immense
multitude
in
the
joy
and
peace
they
had
in
suffering
and
in
death
and
in
the
sustaining
animating
power
of
their
love
to
him
for
whom
they
died
i
have
spoken
to
you
sometimes
of
the
martyrs
of
past
days
i
could
not
help
it
their
memory
is
very
dear
to
me
and
the
records
of
their
faith
and
their
patience
have
touched
and
thrilled
my
own
heart
since
childhood
but
i
never
dreamed
or
guessed
that
even
while
i
spoke
now
in
the
end
of
this
nineteenth
century
this
age
of
science
and
enlightenment
this
age
of
pity
and
compassion
a
new
legion
was
marching
on
through
blood
and
fire
to
join
the
noble
army
of
martyrs
before
the
throne
of
god
here
the
grey
head
which
had
rested
bowed
and
motionless
in
that
seat
below
the
pulpit
was
raised
up
suddenly
and
the
eyes
that
had
witnessed
so
much
agony
sent
a
look
into
the
preacher
face
that
almost
stopped
his
words
but
after
a
scarcely
perceptible
pause
he
went
on
it
has
been
to
some
of
us
a
pain
all
the
greater
because
of
our
utter
helplessness
to
read
even
the
meagre
accounts
that
have
come
to
us
of
the
massacres
in
armenia
now
that
i
have
heard
from
the
lips
of
an
who
is
here
present
amongst
you
this
day
the
details
of
such
massacre
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
solemnly
that
the
pain
should
have
been
greater
still
the
most
awful
the
most
lurid
accounts
we
have
had
fall
short
of
the
terrible
reality
the
half
has
not
been
told
us
then
he
gave
briefly
and
as
calmly
as
he
could
the
story
of
the
massacre
of
urfa
and
of
the
burning
of
the
cathedral
as
john
grayson
had
told
it
to
him
i
refrain
he
continued
from
recounting
horrors
which
would
needlessly
wring
your
hearts
i
speak
of
death
i
do
not
speak
of
torture
i
tell
you
a
little
of
what
men
our
brothers
have
suffered
but
oh
my
brothers
oh
my
sisters
and
theirs
i
have
no
words
to
tell
the
worse
agonies
of
your
helpless
sisters
i
dare
not
tell
i
dare
not
even
hint
at
the
things
i
know
and
which
they
have
had
to
suffer
only
thank
god
on
your
knees
that
he
has
made
you
englishwomen
and
remember
i
have
told
of
urfa
but
urfa
is
only
one
town
of
many
in
armenia
like
things
have
been
done
in
sassoun
in
marash
in
diarbekir
in
melatia
in
kharpoot
in
van
in
erzeroum
in
hundreds
of
towns
and
villages
with
strange
names
we
have
never
heard
the
land
which
for
fertility
and
for
beauty
might
be
a
very
garden
of
eden
is
fast
becoming
a
desolate
wilderness
but
you
will
say
all
this
agony
does
not
make
martyrs
for
that
is
needed
not
suffering
only
but
true
though
in
a
loose
general
fashion
all
those
who
lose
their
lives
in
any
way
on
account
of
their
religion
are
often
called
martyrs
but
even
the
most
stringent
application
of
this
name
of
honour
must
include
all
those
who
have
so
laid
down
their
lives
he
who
has
been
offered
life
on
the
condition
of
apostasy
and
has
refused
it
has
won
his
crown
and
no
man
may
take
it
from
him
armenians
without
number
have
stood
the
test
and
made
the
grand
refusal
in
some
places
the
utterance
of
the
moslem
symbol
of
faith
in
others
the
lifting
up
of
one
finger
was
all
that
was
required
yet
men
and
women
and
children
even
have
endured
death
and
torture
rather
than
say
those
words
or
make
that
sign
shall
i
give
you
instances
shall
i
tell
you
of
the
venerable
archbishop
of
the
ancient
armenian
church
who
had
first
his
hands
and
then
his
arms
hewn
off
but
no
agony
could
separate
him
from
his
saviour
and
at
last
he
died
repeating
the
creed
shall
i
tell
you
of
the
student
of
theology
who
answered
his
tempters
with
a
steadfast
for
i
have
come
to
this
hour
in
god
will
and
appointment
and
i
will
not
change
and
was
slowly
cut
in
pieces
shall
i
tell
you
of
the
little
girl
the
child
of
twelve
who
said
to
the
moslem
believe
in
jesus
christ
he
is
my
saviour
i
love
him
i
can
not
do
as
you
wish
even
if
you
kill
me
shall
i
tell
you
of
another
girl
and
her
young
brother
who
when
the
murderers
came
embraced
one
another
their
faces
radiant
with
joy
are
going
to
christ
they
said
shall
see
him
just
now
time
would
fail
me
indeed
to
tell
of
these
and
of
the
many
like
them
in
faith
and
patience
but
one
thing
is
as
true
of
those
who
suffer
for
the
name
of
christ
as
of
those
who
suffered
for
that
name
in
the
first
century
or
the
sixteenth
or
any
century
between
there
walks
with
them
in
the
furnace
one
like
unto
the
son
of
god
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
preacher
resumed
but
there
are
two
questions
our
hearts
are
asking
in
the
face
of
all
this
suffering
is
christ
doing
and
shall
we
do
there
is
no
use
in
saying
that
the
first
of
these
questions
is
one
which
we
ought
not
to
ask
at
all
there
are
times
when
there
is
little
use
even
in
telling
our
passionate
aching
human
hearts
that
we
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
what
we
know
and
believe
of
his
spiritual
presence
with
his
faithful
people
thank
god
he
did
not
forbid
the
questionings
of
his
tried
servant
the
prophet
who
flung
himself
at
his
feet
with
the
cry
art
thou
o
lord
when
i
plead
with
thee
yet
let
me
talk
with
thee
of
thy
judgments
nor
of
that
other
who
pleaded
art
of
purer
eyes
than
to
behold
evil
and
canst
not
look
on
iniquity
wherefore
lookest
thou
upon
them
that
deal
treacherously
and
holdest
thy
tongue
when
the
wicked
devoureth
the
man
that
is
more
righteous
than
he
indeed
i
dare
to
think
that
if
we
throw
ourselves
at
his
feet
the
feet
pierced
for
us
there
is
no
question
we
may
not
ask
him
there
what
then
christ
doing
he
sits
in
his
glory
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
he
sees
all
this
agony
and
he
it
still
go
he
sustains
the
sufferers
he
strengthens
and
comforts
them
often
but
he
it
still
go
can
he
bear
it
our
hearts
cry
out
sometimes
i
think
the
answer
is
that
he
bearing
it
he
suffered
for
the
sufferers
that
is
not
all
he
suffers
them
that
is
yet
not
all
he
suffers
them
they
are
not
his
people
only
but
his
members
of
his
flesh
and
of
his
bones
for
reasons
inscrutable
to
us
his
agony
must
go
on
still
in
them
still
he
cries
to
the
oppressor
persecutest
thou
me
but
one
day
he
and
they
and
we
also
shall
see
the
end
then
shall
we
know
the
secret
of
the
lord
then
shall
the
mystery
of
god
be
finished
meanwhile
with
the
martyrs
it
is
well
are
they
before
the
throne
of
god
and
serve
him
day
and
night
in
his
temple
and
he
that
sitteth
on
the
throne
shall
dwell
among
them
but
are
not
yet
there
beyond
the
agony
for
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
sufferers
bereaved
tortured
dying
slowly
in
turkish
prisons
or
deepest
horror
of
all
in
turkish
harems
what
shall
we
say
is
the
burden
laid
on
our
hearts
for
them
too
heavy
to
be
borne
remember
christ
bears
it
as
in
a
deeper
sense
than
we
can
fathom
christ
bears
it
i
think
this
answers
our
second
question
what
shall
we
do
is
my
saviour
struggling
there
in
those
poor
limbs
i
see
friends
if
he
is
there
indeed
in
his
members
what
sacrifice
would
we
not
make
what
treasure
would
we
not
pour
out
with
joy
to
come
to
his
help
but
perhaps
you
say
we
do
i
am
not
speaking
to
those
who
can
influence
the
councils
of
our
rulers
except
by
prayer
and
by
the
formation
and
expression
of
that
intelligent
opinion
which
does
in
the
end
make
its
power
felt
therefore
it
is
beside
the
question
to
ask
what
they
should
have
done
or
what
they
should
do
now
we
have
to
find
out
what
should
do
each
one
of
there
are
thousands
of
little
children
fatherless
and
motherless
because
their
fathers
and
mothers
have
gone
to
god
often
through
the
gate
of
martyrdom
they
are
wandering
in
the
streets
homeless
and
destitute
they
die
or
haply
they
are
taken
by
moslems
and
taught
to
hate
the
faith
their
parents
died
for
can
rescue
there
are
thousands
of
widows
desolate
in
heart
and
home
each
with
her
tale
of
anguish
longing
it
may
be
to
lay
down
her
weary
head
and
join
her
loved
ones
in
the
grave
yet
forced
to
struggle
on
for
the
daily
bread
of
those
still
dependent
on
her
can
succour
there
are
thousands
of
ruined
men
who
have
lost
home
occupation
health
and
whose
hearts
are
desperate
with
the
things
they
have
seen
and
suffered
can
give
back
hope
to
one
word
more
brethren
we
have
spoken
of
the
power
of
the
name
of
christ
that
name
which
we
teach
our
little
ones
to
lisp
that
name
which
sanctifies
our
daily
prayers
that
name
which
our
beloved
ones
whispered
to
us
with
failing
breath
as
their
feet
drew
near
the
dark
valley
that
name
which
yet
oh
strange
mystery
is
dearer
to
our
hearts
than
even
theirs
that
name
was
on
the
lips
of
each
one
of
the
slaughtered
multitude
whose
blood
is
crying
to
heaven
that
name
is
still
on
the
lips
of
the
suffering
remnant
that
are
left
it
is
in
that
name
that
they
ask
our
sympathy
our
help
i
have
spoken
of
our
dead
our
dear
dead
who
lie
out
yonder
where
god
blessed
sun
is
shining
on
the
graves
in
which
we
laid
them
to
their
rest
we
turned
sadly
away
we
thought
our
hearts
were
breaking
because
we
to
lay
them
there
what
of
our
brothers
and
our
sisters
to
whom
it
is
joy
past
telling
the
only
joy
they
can
look
for
now
to
know
their
beloved
ones
are
dead
and
safe
in
that
land
of
sorrow
they
weep
not
for
the
dead
neither
bemoan
them
it
is
for
the
living
that
they
weep
nor
are
there
graves
to
weep
over
even
if
they
fain
would
do
it
the
dead
and
remember
they
are
the
christian
dead
lie
unburied
in
the
open
fields
or
are
heaped
together
in
trenches
which
the
earth
can
scarcely
cover
known
unto
god
the
father
known
unto
christ
the
redeemer
is
each
atom
of
this
undistinguished
dust
into
his
keeping
he
has
taken
the
dead
but
to
us
he
leaves
the
remnants
that
survive
and
that
it
is
possible
still
to
save
will
you
take
them
to
your
hearts
for
his
name
sake
the
preacher
gave
the
usual
benediction
descended
from
the
pulpit
and
began
in
due
course
to
read
the
beautiful
prayer
for
the
whole
state
of
christ
church
militant
here
in
earth
very
solemnly
in
a
voice
of
suppressed
emotion
he
read
on
till
he
came
to
the
words
and
we
most
humbly
beseech
thee
of
thy
goodness
o
lord
to
comfort
and
succour
all
them
who
in
this
transitory
life
are
in
trouble
sorrow
need
sickness
or
any
other
adversity
here
his
voice
faltered
but
he
went
resolutely
on
and
we
also
bless
thy
holy
name
for
all
thy
servants
departed
this
life
in
thy
faith
and
fear
then
the
rush
of
feeling
overwhelmed
him
and
he
did
that
fatal
thing
to
do
in
an
assembly
charged
with
emotion
he
stopped
a
sob
broke
from
one
then
from
another
and
yet
another
still
until
a
wave
of
weeping
passed
over
the
whole
like
the
wind
over
a
field
of
corn
it
was
but
a
few
moments
the
reader
recovered
himself
and
continued
the
service
nearly
all
the
congregation
remained
and
gathered
round
the
table
of
their
lord
that
day
and
it
may
be
they
felt
as
they
had
never
done
before
the
bond
of
communion
with
the
scattered
and
suffering
members
of
the
lord
christ
that
evening
john
grayson
said
to
his
cousin
of
course
you
know
that
i
am
going
back
again
with
only
a
change
of
name
i
am
going
with
you
frederick
pangbourne
answered
quietly
you
jack
heart
gave
a
sudden
leap
why
not
there
are
plenty
to
work
here
and
i
have
often
thought
of
the
mission
field
is
there
any
field
more
urgent
than
this
jack
was
silent
grave
with
a
solemn
joy
what
might
not
they
two
accomplish
shoulder
to
shoulder
the
fortune
he
had
already
resolved
to
share
with
fred
all
consecrated
to
the
work
fred
continued
do
you
remember
that
cry
that
rose
from
ten
thousand
hearts
when
peter
the
hermit
called
upon
all
christendom
to
rescue
the
sepulchre
of
christ
from
the
hands
of
the
moslem
le
veut
wills
it
is
it
not
as
much
a
war
of
the
cross
to
rescue
from
them
not
his
empty
sepulchre
but
even
a
few
of
his
living
suffering
members
we
can
say
you
and
i
wills
it
appendix
the
greatest
care
has
been
taken
to
make
the
foregoing
pages
absolutely
true
to
fact
all
that
has
been
told
of
the
massacres
and
their
attendant
circumstances
has
been
taken
either
from
thoroughly
reliable
published
sources
or
from
the
narratives
of
trustworthy
in
the
story
of
the
massacre
of
urfa
and
the
burning
of
the
cathedral
the
official
report
of
fitzmaurice
has
been
largely
used
and
only
supplemented
by
the
additional
details
furnished
by
those
on
the
spot
in
one
respect
particularly
the
truth
has
been
strictly
adhered
to
every
instance
given
of
properly
or
of
courage
faith
patience
or
devotion
is
entirely
authentic
the
stories
of
stepanian
of
thomassian
and
his
wife
of
the
selferians
of
anna
hanum
of
gabriel
of
vahanian
are
all
perfectly
true
the
names
only
have
been
altered
this
alteration
of
names
was
rendered
necessary
by
the
circumstances
of
the
case
but
every
one
at
all
acquainted
with
the
subject
will
recognise
the
heroic
lady
i
have
ventured
to
call
miss
celandine
to
the
very
remarkable
character
of
the
martyred
pastor
stepanian
i
have
i
fear
done
imperfect
justice
the
particulars
of
his
death
and
of
the
fate
of
his
children
are
given
quite
accurately
and
the
ideas
attributed
to
him
and
even
the
illustrations
used
are
really
his
own
the
only
slight
departure
from
known
fact
has
been
the
assumption
that
the
quick
and
painless
death
for
which
those
who
loved
him
thanked
god
to
one
such
it
brought
the
she
was
able
to
shed
came
from
the
hand
of
a
friendly
turk
for
one
other
departure
from
fact
i
have
to
apologise
i
have
ignored
the
existence
in
biridjik
during
the
time
embraced
by
the
story
of
a
protestant
church
and
pastor
and
this
although
the
sufferings
of
the
pastor
and
his
family
in
the
massacre
there
would
form
in
themselves
a
thrilling
narrative
but
i
desired
to
show
something
of
the
gregorian
church
and
the
armenian
people
as
they
existed
apart
from
any
contact
with
foreigners
throughout
i
have
tried
to
give
the
impression
which
is
the
true
one
that
gregorians
and
protestants
have
suffered
and
died
with
equal
heroism
and
equal
willingness
for
the
name
of
christ
there
is
nevertheless
one
important
sense
in
which
facts
have
been
truly
represented
it
has
been
absolutely
impossible
to
depict
the
worst
features
of
these
horrible
crimes
to
tell
we
know
would
be
simply
to
defeat
the
end
for
which
we
write
no
one
would
read
the
pages
it
has
been
necessary
to
cover
tortures
the
most
ingenious
the
most
hideous
and
the
most
excruciating
with
a
veil
of
general
expressions
and
outrages
yet
more
terrible
than
any
torture
with
a
still
denser
veil
of
reticence
of
what
has
been
endured
by
unnumbered
multitudes
of
our
helpless
sisters
it
is
agony
to
speak
but
is
it
not
also
sin
and
cowardice
to
keep
silence
an
attempt
has
been
made
in
the
foregoing
pages
so
to
speak
and
so
to
keep
silence
and
especially
so
to
subordinate
the
horror
of
cruelty
to
the
glory
of
martyrdom
that
the
most
sensitive
and
tender
heart
may
not
be
too
painfully
wrung
there
is
indeed
much
excuse
for
the
tenderhearted
when
they
say
as
they
often
do
we
will
not
read
about
this
subject
we
will
not
think
of
it
it
is
too
horrible
our
lives
are
full
already
of
cares
and
duties
perhaps
even
of
christian
work
we
can
not
take
up
this
burden
in
addition
to
the
rest
it
would
sink
us
that
is
intelligible
and
natural
sometimes
even
right
but
it
is
right
that
those
who
thus
decline
to
examine
the
case
should
at
the
same
time
prejudge
it
should
dismiss
with
scorn
or
incredulity
or
carelessness
the
testimony
of
those
who
having
gone
down
into
that
depth
of
horror
have
come
back
burdened
with
an
anguish
which
can
only
find
relief
in
the
effort
to
help
the
surviving
sufferers
one
of
two
things
people
surely
ought
to
do
they
ought
to
examine
the
evidence
for
themselves
or
declining
this
and
possibly
with
good
reason
they
ought
to
accept
the
conclusions
of
those
who
have
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
tragedy
many
were
misled
and
not
inexcusably
by
reports
that
came
from
official
sources
in
turkey
here
is
a
specimen
a
message
sent
by
the
sultan
to
the
ambassador
of
england
in
february
when
the
unprovoked
slaughter
of
the
unarmed
and
defenceless
thousands
of
urfa
was
still
reeking
to
heaven
that
the
armenians
have
everywhere
and
always
been
the
aggressors
that
the
mussulmans
have
been
attacked
in
their
mosques
during
their
prayers
that
they
have
suffered
nameless
atrocities
from
the
armenians
for
the
latter
had
martini
guns
dynamite
and
bombs
while
to
defend
themselves
the
mussulmans
had
only
old
superseded
were
pascal
amongst
us
now
he
would
scarcely
devote
to
the
confusion
of
the
jesuits
his
celebrated
impudentissime
happily
the
truth
is
known
now
it
may
be
briefly
summed
up
in
the
words
of
victor
bérard
an
eminent
frenchman
well
acquainted
with
the
east
who
has
devoted
himself
to
the
careful
investigation
of
the
whole
question
and
published
the
results
in
politique
du
in
the
opinion
and
the
language
of
all
christians
and
mussulmans
and
turks
greeks
and
bulgarians
natives
and
strangers
he
the
sultan
remains
the
promoter
and
arranger
of
all
that
has
been
done
within
the
last
two
years
every
one
knows
and
every
one
says
has
wished
it
he
has
ordained
it
the
master
has
permitted
us
to
kill
the
armenians
this
permission
has
cost
the
lives
of
more
than
hundred
human
beings
for
besides
the
public
butcheries
the
en
masse
and
the
massacres
with
spear
and
sword
how
many
stabbings
with
knives
assassinations
and
private
murders
besides
those
who
were
murdered
how
many
women
children
and
old
people
perishing
in
the
fields
left
uncultivated
in
the
villages
infested
with
the
odour
of
corpses
in
that
epidemic
of
plague
and
cholera
which
since
has
desolated
turkish
armenia
putting
all
exaggeration
aside
we
may
make
the
following
calculation
since
the
of
july
more
than
armenian
communities
have
been
stricken
or
suppressed
some
like
those
of
constantinople
or
sassoun
have
had
more
than
dead
the
figure
of
as
at
malatia
diarbekr
arabkir
has
often
been
reached
that
of
is
common
and
the
minimum
of
has
been
everywhere
exceeded
van
with
seems
to
hold
the
first
rank
taking
then
an
average
of
dead
we
remain
much
under
the
truth
and
this
average
for
the
communities
stricken
gives
corpses
how
in
a
time
of
unbroken
peace
could
a
man
conceive
such
an
enterprise
and
how
under
the
eyes
of
europe
could
he
bring
it
to
pass
it
need
only
be
added
that
those
on
the
spot
consider
the
above
figures
indeed
under
the
a
common
way
of
dismissing
the
subject
with
a
phrase
is
to
say
the
armenians
are
as
bad
as
the
turks
this
may
be
understood
in
either
of
two
senses
the
first
originators
probably
meaning
it
in
one
while
those
who
repeat
it
commonly
take
it
in
the
other
it
may
mean
the
turk
at
bottom
is
as
good
as
the
armenian
the
armenian
at
bottom
is
as
bad
as
the
turk
whether
this
be
true
or
no
it
does
not
affect
the
present
question
if
we
see
a
man
being
murdered
we
do
not
stay
to
enquire
into
his
character
and
antecedents
before
coming
to
his
aid
were
the
armenians
the
most
degraded
race
in
the
world
and
the
turks
originally
the
noblest
that
is
no
reason
why
humanity
should
allow
the
turks
to
torture
and
outrage
and
slay
the
armenians
but
if
the
meaning
is
that
the
armenians
are
as
much
to
blame
for
these
troubles
as
much
in
fault
with
respect
to
them
as
the
turks
it
might
be
relevant
if
it
were
true
true
however
it
emphatically
is
not
hear
the
testimony
of
lepsius
who
has
made
an
exhaustive
study
of
the
whole
question
the
armenians
are
not
to
blame
it
would
certainly
have
been
no
wonder
if
the
armenian
people
who
for
years
by
a
systematic
policy
of
annihilation
on
the
part
of
the
porte
had
been
given
over
defenceless
to
every
kind
of
injustice
at
the
hands
of
turkish
officials
to
every
sort
of
violence
on
the
part
of
their
kourdish
lords
to
extortion
by
the
commissioners
of
taxes
and
to
the
utter
illegality
of
the
law
courts
had
risen
up
in
a
last
desperate
struggle
against
the
iron
yoke
of
tyranny
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
a
national
rising
to
begin
with
the
armenians
though
large
districts
are
thickly
populated
with
them
are
by
no
means
everywhere
in
a
majority
in
the
provinces
in
question
and
by
the
law
which
forbids
christians
to
carry
arms
while
allowing
them
to
mahometans
they
are
absolutely
defenceless
in
fact
no
one
in
armenia
has
ever
thought
of
demanding
anything
like
autonomy
all
that
was
hoped
for
was
that
the
reforms
should
be
carried
out
which
eighteen
years
before
had
been
guaranteed
by
the
christian
powers
and
which
seemed
to
promise
to
the
armenians
an
existence
at
least
bearable
through
the
entire
district
of
the
massacre
we
have
not
been
able
to
discover
notwithstanding
the
fulness
of
our
information
any
movement
except
that
in
zeitoun
which
could
be
considered
to
be
of
the
nature
of
a
revolt
the
commissioners
in
their
report
were
not
even
able
to
establish
any
act
of
provocation
on
the
part
of
the
armenians
and
when
such
were
alleged
by
the
turkish
authorities
the
official
report
has
proved
it
to
be
untrue
this
is
what
occurred
in
zeitoun
the
armenian
mountaineers
of
the
being
terrified
by
the
news
of
the
massacres
in
the
neighbouring
provinces
fled
in
thousands
for
protection
to
zeitoun
a
natural
fortress
among
the
mountains
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
town
there
are
more
than
a
hundred
villages
inhabited
exclusively
by
armenians
who
also
pressed
into
zeitoun
near
the
town
there
was
a
turkish
citadel
with
a
garrison
of
about
men
the
armenians
received
news
that
this
garrison
was
about
to
be
considerably
reinforced
and
that
an
attack
was
designed
on
the
defenceless
people
in
zeitoun
the
armenians
decided
to
forestall
it
they
armed
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
stormed
the
citadel
and
forced
the
garrison
to
surrender
before
reinforcements
arrived
they
then
fortified
themselves
in
zeitoun
and
held
it
the
whole
winter
against
an
army
of
men
who
from
time
to
time
were
sent
against
them
the
result
of
the
struggle
has
justified
the
armenians
of
zeitoun
if
indeed
we
are
prepared
to
recognise
the
right
of
for
the
european
consuls
intervened
and
obtained
for
the
brave
zeitounlis
honourable
terms
of
peace
and
an
amnesty
it
ought
to
be
added
however
that
the
promises
made
by
the
turks
were
shamelessly
violated
and
of
the
zeitounlis
put
to
the
sword
but
are
there
not
armenian
revolutionary
committees
and
armenian
revolutionaries
who
elaborate
dark
designs
in
secret
and
throw
bombs
and
do
other
desperate
things
certainly
there
were
some
revolutionaries
lepsius
says
again
and
in
some
foreign
towns
there
are
still
revolutionary
committees
human
nature
must
have
changed
if
there
are
not
and
one
can
only
wonder
that
their
number
is
so
small
and
their
action
so
unimportant
at
any
rate
the
turkish
government
is
under
obligation
to
them
for
existing
and
is
satisfied
that
they
should
not
die
out
for
who
would
then
supply
the
sparrows
to
be
shot
at
with
the
cannon
prepared
the
editor
of
the
rade
has
already
shown
up
the
nonsense
that
is
put
into
european
newspapers
about
armenian
revolutionary
committees
and
has
passed
a
just
judgment
on
the
boundless
credulity
of
our
newspapers
and
their
readers
it
must
be
remembered
that
lepsius
writes
in
german
and
for
germans
in
fact
the
armenians
and
their
friends
would
be
glad
to
know
what
course
of
action
they
could
possibly
pursue
which
would
commend
them
to
the
sympathies
of
europe
if
people
are
attacked
they
must
either
submit
or
resist
or
run
away
run
away
the
armenians
can
not
they
are
strictly
forbidden
to
leave
the
country
and
those
who
have
succeeded
in
doing
so
have
done
it
in
spite
of
the
government
if
they
resist
they
are
rebels
revolutionaries
and
the
sultan
in
killing
them
is
only
exercising
his
undoubted
right
of
punishing
his
revolted
subjects
if
they
submit
which
is
what
except
in
the
case
of
the
zeitounlis
they
have
almost
always
done
they
are
cowards
unworthy
on
that
account
of
our
sympathies
the
sands
of
the
colisseum
and
the
gardens
of
nero
in
old
rome
were
strewn
with
the
bones
or
the
ashes
of
just
such
cowards
but
that
is
not
the
name
by
which
we
call
them
now
still
it
is
sometimes
said
the
armenians
did
not
suffer
as
christians
but
as
armenians
other
christians
subjects
of
the
porte
have
not
been
molested
that
even
if
true
is
but
half
the
truth
christians
who
were
not
armenians
were
not
killed
armenians
who
were
not
christians
that
is
to
say
who
renounced
christianity
were
not
killed
therefore
the
armenians
suffered
not
as
armenians
alone
and
not
as
christians
alone
but
as
and
those
armenians
who
need
not
have
suffered
if
they
would
have
ceased
to
be
christians
suffered
definitely
but
how
did
the
armenians
concentrate
upon
themselves
all
this
furious
hatred
why
should
they
be
massacred
rather
than
greeks
or
syrians
there
are
several
reasons
the
greeks
enjoy
the
protection
of
a
foreign
government
somewhat
in
the
same
way
as
do
the
americans
and
the
english
the
syrians
besides
being
less
numerous
are
much
more
under
the
observation
and
the
patronage
of
foreigners
the
armenians
happen
to
be
the
most
numerous
of
the
christian
races
in
turkey
therefore
they
bear
the
brunt
of
the
crusade
the
jacobites
the
chaldeans
and
the
nestorians
have
their
proportionate
share
but
some
say
the
armenians
have
made
themselves
particularly
obnoxious
to
the
mussulmans
as
money
lenders
and
usurers
that
they
have
shown
themselves
rapacious
and
exacting
and
greedy
of
dishonest
gain
the
same
accusations
were
brought
against
the
jews
in
the
middle
ages
and
against
the
russian
jews
in
our
own
day
there
is
perhaps
the
same
amount
of
truth
in
them
put
a
clever
industrious
ambitious
race
under
the
heel
of
an
indolent
unprogressive
one
and
the
former
is
sure
to
seize
eagerly
and
not
to
use
too
scrupulously
the
only
power
within
its
reach
the
power
of
the
purse
as
for
usury
was
not
per
cent
considered
a
fair
demand
in
the
dark
ages
in
view
of
the
standing
an
even
chance
of
getting
nothing
at
all
or
of
getting
something
very
undesirable
in
the
shape
of
the
rack
or
the
dungeon
insecurity
is
the
parent
of
usury
but
granted
that
the
armenians
in
other
parts
of
the
turkish
empire
and
even
occasionally
in
armenia
itself
may
have
earned
some
popular
hatred
in
this
or
in
other
ways
the
vast
majority
of
the
victims
have
been
not
usurers
not
wealthy
merchants
but
industrious
artisans
small
shopkeepers
cultivators
of
the
soil
with
an
admixture
of
the
more
educated
classes
the
most
envenomed
hatred
being
directed
against
those
in
any
way
connected
with
religion
whether
as
gregorian
priests
or
as
protestant
pastors
skilled
craftsmen
who
abounded
amongst
the
armenians
have
been
so
nearly
exterminated
that
some
towns
are
left
without
a
mason
a
carpenter
or
a
shoemaker
in
others
the
turks
have
saved
a
few
of
these
artificers
alive
to
supply
them
with
the
conveniences
which
they
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
make
for
themselves
the
armenian
character
can
not
be
dismissed
with
a
few
hasty
generalities
it
is
doubtful
that
national
character
can
be
so
dismissed
and
the
higher
we
rise
in
the
scale
of
organic
development
the
more
variety
we
find
uno
disce
is
an
indifferent
rule
even
for
the
fijian
or
the
samoan
but
who
would
apply
it
to
the
englishman
or
the
frenchman
the
armenian
heir
of
an
old
civilization
stands
on
a
plane
with
the
latter
not
with
the
former
the
worst
armenians
and
naturally
they
are
those
oftenest
found
in
foreign
countries
show
just
the
faults
sure
to
be
engendered
in
any
race
and
especially
in
an
astute
intelligent
enterprising
race
by
centuries
of
oppression
these
are
want
of
truthfulness
and
honesty
and
greediness
of
gain
against
these
which
may
be
called
the
national
faults
there
are
great
national
virtues
to
set
off
moral
purity
sobriety
strong
domestic
affections
gratitude
fidelity
to
conviction
industry
and
a
very
remarkable
love
of
learning
the
best
armenians
men
like
pastor
stepanian
who
have
cast
off
the
national
faults
and
retain
the
national
virtues
develop
a
very
noble
and
singularly
attractive
character
and
are
besides
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
the
wood
is
fine
in
grain
and
takes
the
polish
easily
this
deeply
suffering
race
is
not
faultless
what
race
ever
was
or
is
or
will
be
but
it
is
emphatically
and
it
is
still
in
our
power
to
save
very
many
starving
men
desolate
and
hopeless
women
and
helpless
little
children
should
any
reader
of
the
foregoing
pages
desire
to
bear
a
hand
in
this
good
work
and
even
those
who
have
little
to
give
may
save
or
help
to
save
woman
or
child
they
may
learn
how
to
do
it
by
communicating
with
the
association
of
friends

armenia
