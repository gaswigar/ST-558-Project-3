is
there
a
santa
claus
dear
riis
a
little
chap
of
six
on
the
western
frontier
writes
to
us
you
please
tell
me
if
there
is
a
santa
claus
papa
says
not
wo
you
answer
him
that
was
the
message
that
came
to
me
from
an
editor
last
december
just
as
i
was
going
on
a
journey
why
he
sent
it
to
me
i
do
know
perhaps
it
was
because
when
i
was
a
little
chap
my
home
was
way
up
toward
that
white
north
where
even
the
little
boys
ride
in
sleds
behind
reindeer
as
they
are
the
only
horses
they
have
perhaps
it
was
because
when
i
was
a
young
lad
i
knew
hans
christian
andersen
who
surely
ought
to
know
and
spoke
his
tongue
perhaps
it
was
both
i
will
ask
the
editor
when
i
see
him
meanwhile
here
was
his
letter
with
christmas
right
at
the
door
and
as
i
said
i
was
going
on
a
journey
i
buttoned
it
up
in
my
great
coat
along
with
a
lot
of
other
letters
i
did
have
time
to
read
and
i
thought
as
i
went
to
the
depot
what
a
pity
it
was
that
my
little
friend
papa
should
have
forgotten
about
santa
claus
we
big
people
do
forget
the
strangest
way
and
then
we
have
got
a
bit
of
a
good
time
any
more
no
santa
claus
if
you
had
asked
that
car
full
of
people
i
would
have
liked
to
hear
the
answers
they
would
have
given
you
no
santa
claus
why
there
was
scarce
a
man
in
the
lot
who
did
carry
a
bundle
that
looked
as
if
it
had
just
tumbled
out
of
his
sleigh
i
felt
of
one
slyly
and
it
was
a
boy
sled
a
flexible
flyer
i
know
because
he
left
one
at
our
house
the
christmas
before
and
i
distinctly
heard
the
rattling
of
a
pair
of
skates
in
that
box
in
the
next
seat
they
were
all
every
one
though
the
train
was
behind
time
that
is
a
sure
sign
of
christmas
the
brakeman
wore
a
piece
of
mistletoe
in
his
cap
and
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
and
he
said
merry
christmas
in
a
way
to
make
a
man
feel
good
all
the
rest
of
the
day
no
santa
claus
is
there
you
just
ask
him
and
then
the
train
rolled
into
the
city
under
the
big
gray
dome
to
which
george
washington
gave
his
name
and
i
went
through
a
doorway
which
all
american
boys
would
rather
see
than
go
to
school
a
whole
week
though
they
love
their
teacher
dearly
it
is
true
that
last
winter
my
own
little
lad
told
the
kind
man
whose
house
it
is
that
he
would
rather
ride
up
and
down
in
the
elevator
at
the
hotel
but
that
was
because
he
was
so
very
little
at
the
time
and
did
know
things
rightly
and
besides
it
was
his
first
experience
with
an
elevator
as
i
was
saying
i
went
through
the
door
into
a
beautiful
white
hall
with
lofty
pillars
between
which
there
were
regular
banks
of
holly
with
the
red
berries
shining
through
just
as
if
it
were
out
in
the
woods
and
from
behind
one
of
them
there
came
the
merriest
laugh
you
could
ever
think
of
do
you
think
now
it
was
that
letter
in
my
pocket
that
gave
that
guilty
little
throb
against
my
heart
when
i
heard
it
or
what
could
it
have
been
i
had
even
time
to
ask
myself
the
question
for
there
stood
my
host
all
framed
in
holly
and
with
the
heartiest
handclasp
come
in
he
said
and
drew
me
after
the
coffee
is
waiting
and
he
beamed
upon
the
table
with
the
veriest
christmas
face
as
he
poured
it
out
himself
one
cup
for
his
dear
wife
and
one
for
me
the
children
ah
you
should
have
asked
if
there
was
a
santa
claus
and
so
we
sat
and
talked
and
i
told
my
kind
friends
that
my
own
dear
old
mother
whom
i
have
not
seen
for
years
was
very
very
sick
in
denmark
and
longing
for
her
boy
and
a
mist
came
into
my
hostess
gentle
eyes
and
she
said
let
us
cable
over
and
tell
her
how
much
we
think
of
her
though
she
had
never
seen
her
and
it
was
no
sooner
said
than
done
in
came
a
man
with
a
and
while
we
drank
our
coffee
this
message
sped
under
the
great
stormy
sea
to
the
country
where
the
day
was
shading
into
evening
already
though
the
sun
was
scarce
two
hours
high
in
washington
the
white
house
riis
ribe
your
son
is
breakfasting
with
us
we
send
you
our
love
and
sympathy
theodore
and
edith
roosevelt
for
you
see
the
house
with
the
holly
in
the
hall
was
the
white
house
and
my
host
was
the
president
of
the
united
states
i
have
to
tell
it
to
you
or
you
might
easily
fall
into
the
same
error
i
came
near
falling
into
i
had
to
pinch
myself
to
make
sure
the
president
was
not
santa
claus
himself
i
felt
that
he
had
in
that
moment
given
me
the
very
greatest
christmas
gift
any
man
ever
received
my
little
mother
life
for
really
what
ailed
her
was
that
she
was
very
old
and
i
know
that
when
she
got
the
president
dispatch
she
must
have
become
immediately
ten
years
younger
and
got
right
out
of
bed
do
you
know
mothers
are
that
way
when
any
one
makes
much
of
their
boys
i
think
santa
claus
must
have
brought
them
all
in
the
beginning
the
mothers
i
mean
i
would
just
give
anything
to
see
what
happened
in
that
old
town
that
is
full
of
blessed
memories
to
me
when
the
telegraph
ticked
off
that
message
i
will
warrant
the
town
hurried
out
burgomaster
bishop
beadle
and
all
to
do
honor
to
my
gentle
old
mother
no
santa
claus
eh
what
was
that
then
that
spanned
two
oceans
with
a
breath
of
love
and
cheer
i
should
like
to
know
tell
me
that
after
the
coffee
we
sat
together
in
the
president
office
for
a
little
while
while
he
signed
commissions
each
and
every
one
of
which
was
just
santa
claus
gift
to
a
boy
who
had
been
good
in
the
year
that
was
going
and
before
we
parted
the
president
had
lifted
with
so
many
strokes
of
his
pen
clouds
of
sorrow
and
want
that
weighed
heavily
on
homes
i
knew
of
to
which
santa
claus
had
had
hard
work
finding
his
way
that
christmas
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
went
out
of
the
door
where
the
big
policeman
touched
his
hat
and
wished
me
a
merry
christmas
that
the
sun
never
shone
so
brightly
in
may
as
it
did
then
i
quite
expected
to
see
the
crocuses
and
the
jonquils
that
make
the
white
house
garden
so
pretty
out
in
full
bloom
they
were
not
i
suppose
only
because
they
are
official
flowers
and
have
a
proper
respect
for
the
calendar
that
runs
congress
and
the
executive
department
too
i
stopped
on
the
way
down
the
avenue
at
uncle
sam
paymaster
to
see
what
he
thought
of
it
and
there
he
was
busy
as
could
be
making
ready
for
the
coming
of
santa
claus
no
need
of
my
asking
any
questions
here
men
stood
in
line
with
in
their
hands
asking
for
gold
new
they
said
most
every
one
the
paymaster
who
had
a
sprig
of
christmas
green
fixed
in
his
desk
just
like
any
other
man
laughed
and
shook
his
head
and
said
santa
claus
and
the
men
in
the
line
laughed
too
and
nodded
and
went
away
with
their
old
one
man
who
went
out
just
ahead
of
me
i
saw
stoop
over
a
poor
woman
on
the
corner
and
thrust
something
into
her
hand
then
walk
hastily
away
it
was
i
who
caught
the
light
in
the
woman
eye
and
the
blessing
upon
her
poor
wan
lips
and
the
grass
seemed
greener
in
the
treasury
dooryard
and
the
sky
bluer
than
it
had
been
before
even
on
that
bright
day
perhaps
well
never
mind
if
any
one
says
anything
to
you
about
principles
and
giving
alms
you
tell
him
that
santa
claus
takes
care
of
the
principles
at
christmas
and
not
to
be
afraid
as
for
him
if
you
want
to
know
just
ask
the
old
woman
on
the
treasury
corner
and
so
walking
down
that
avenue
of
i
came
to
my
train
again
and
went
home
and
when
i
had
time
to
think
it
all
over
i
remembered
the
letters
in
my
pocket
which
i
had
not
opened
i
took
them
out
and
read
them
and
among
them
were
two
sent
to
me
in
trust
for
santa
claus
himself
which
i
had
to
lay
away
with
the
editor
message
until
i
got
the
dew
rubbed
off
my
spectacles
one
was
from
a
great
banker
and
it
contained
a
check
for
a
thousand
dollars
to
help
buy
a
home
for
some
poor
children
of
the
east
side
tenements
in
new
york
where
the
chimneys
are
so
small
and
mean
that
scarce
even
a
letter
will
go
up
through
them
so
that
ever
so
many
little
ones
over
there
never
get
on
santa
books
at
all
the
other
letter
was
from
a
lonely
old
widow
almost
as
old
as
my
dear
mother
in
denmark
and
it
contained
a
bill
for
years
she
wrote
she
had
saved
and
saved
hoping
some
time
to
have
five
dollars
and
then
she
would
go
with
me
to
the
homes
of
the
very
poor
and
be
santa
claus
herself
and
wherever
you
decided
it
was
right
to
leave
a
trifle
that
should
be
the
place
where
it
would
be
left
read
the
letter
but
now
she
was
so
old
that
she
could
no
longer
think
of
such
a
trip
and
so
she
sent
the
money
she
had
saved
and
i
thought
of
a
family
in
one
of
those
tenements
where
father
and
mother
are
both
lying
ill
with
a
boy
who
ought
to
be
in
school
fighting
all
alone
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
and
winning
the
fight
i
guess
he
has
been
too
busy
to
send
any
message
up
the
chimney
if
indeed
there
is
one
in
his
house
but
you
ask
him
right
now
whether
he
thinks
there
is
a
santa
claus
or
not
no
santa
claus
yes
my
little
man
there
is
a
santa
claus
thank
god
your
father
had
just
forgotten
the
world
would
indeed
be
poor
without
one
it
is
true
that
he
does
not
always
wear
a
white
beard
and
drive
a
reindeer
team
not
always
you
know
but
what
does
it
matter
he
is
santa
claus
with
the
big
loving
christmas
heart
for
all
that
santa
claus
with
the
kind
thoughts
for
every
one
that
make
children
and
people
beam
with
happiness
all
day
long
and
shall
i
tell
you
a
secret
which
i
did
not
learn
at
the
but
it
is
true
all
the
same
of
how
you
can
always
be
sure
your
letters
go
to
him
straight
by
the
chimney
route
it
is
this
send
along
with
them
a
friendly
thought
for
the
boy
you
do
like
for
jack
who
punched
you
or
jim
who
was
mean
to
you
the
meaner
he
was
the
harder
do
you
resolve
to
make
it
up
not
to
bear
him
a
grudge
that
is
the
stamp
for
the
letter
to
santa
nobody
can
stop
it
not
even
a
in
the
chimney
when
it
has
that
on
because
do
you
know
santa
claus
is
the
spirit
of
christmas
and
ever
and
ever
so
many
years
ago
when
the
dear
little
baby
was
born
after
whom
we
call
christmas
and
was
cradled
in
a
manger
out
in
the
stable
because
there
was
not
room
in
the
inn
that
spirit
came
into
the
world
to
soften
the
hearts
of
men
and
make
them
love
one
another
therefore
that
is
the
mark
of
the
spirit
to
this
day
do
let
anybody
or
anything
rub
it
out
then
the
rest
does
matter
let
them
tear
white
beard
off
at
the
festival
and
growl
in
his
bearskin
coat
these
are
only
his
disguises
the
steps
of
the
real
santa
claus
you
can
trace
all
through
the
world
as
you
have
done
here
with
me
and
when
you
stand
in
the
last
of
his
tracks
you
will
find
the
blessed
babe
of
bethlehem
smiling
a
welcome
to
you
for
then
you
will
be
home
