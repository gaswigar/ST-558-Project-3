on
the
high
land
overlooking
the
distant
channel
and
the
hills
beyond
it
the
spring
day
set
in
azure
was
laced
with
gold
and
green
gorse
bushes
flaunted
their
colour
larch
trees
hung
out
their
tassels
and
celandines
starred
the
bright
green
grass
in
an
air
which
seemed
palpably
blue
it
made
a
mist
among
the
trees
and
poured
itself
into
the
ground
as
though
to
dye
the
earth
from
which
hyacinths
would
soon
spring
far
away
the
channel
might
have
been
a
still
blue
lake
the
hills
wore
soft
blue
veils
and
like
a
giant
reservoir
the
deeper
blue
of
the
sky
promised
unlimited
supplies
there
were
sheep
and
lambs
bleating
in
the
fields
birds
sang
with
a
piercing
sweetness
and
no
human
being
was
in
sight
until
up
on
the
broad
grassy
track
which
branched
off
from
the
main
road
and
had
the
larch
wood
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
rough
descending
fields
there
appeared
a
woman
on
a
horse
the
bit
jingled
gaily
the
leather
creaked
the
horse
smelling
the
turf
gave
a
snort
of
delight
but
his
rider
restrained
him
lightly
on
her
right
hand
was
the
open
country
sloping
slowly
to
the
water
on
her
left
was
the
stealthiness
of
the
larch
wood
over
and
about
everything
was
the
blue
day
straight
ahead
of
her
the
track
dipped
to
a
lane
and
beyond
that
the
ground
rose
again
in
fields
sprinkled
with
the
drab
and
white
of
sheep
and
lambs
and
backed
by
the
elm
trees
of
sales
hall
she
could
see
the
chimneys
of
the
house
and
the
rooks
nests
in
the
elm
tops
and
as
though
the
sight
reminded
her
of
something
mildly
amusing
the
smoothness
of
her
face
was
ruffled
by
a
smile
the
stillness
of
her
pose
by
a
quick
glance
about
her
but
if
she
looked
for
anyone
she
did
not
find
him
there
were
small
sounds
from
the
larch
wood
little
creakings
and
rustlings
but
there
was
no
human
footstep
and
the
only
visible
movements
were
made
by
the
breeze
in
the
trees
and
in
the
grass
the
flight
of
a
bird
and
the
distant
gambolling
of
lambs
she
rode
on
down
the
steep
stony
slope
into
the
lane
and
after
hesitating
for
a
moment
she
turned
to
the
right
where
the
lane
was
broadened
by
a
border
of
rich
grass
and
a
bank
here
primroses
lay
snugly
in
their
clumps
of
crinkled
leaves
and
wishing
to
feel
the
coolness
of
their
slim
pale
stalks
between
her
fingers
rose
mallett
dismounted
slipped
the
reins
over
her
arm
and
allowed
her
horse
to
feed
while
she
stooped
to
the
flowers
then
in
the
full
sunshine
with
the
soft
breeze
trying
to
loosen
her
hair
with
the
flowers
in
her
bare
hand
she
straightened
herself
consciously
happy
in
the
beauty
of
the
day
in
the
freedom
and
strength
of
her
body
in
the
smell
of
the
earth
and
the
sight
of
the
country
she
had
known
and
loved
all
her
life
it
was
long
since
she
had
ridden
here
without
encountering
francis
sales
who
was
bound
up
with
her
knowledge
of
the
country
and
who
quite
evidently
wished
to
annex
some
of
the
love
she
lavished
on
it
this
was
a
ridiculous
desire
which
made
her
smile
again
yet
while
she
was
glad
to
be
alone
she
missed
the
attention
of
his
presence
he
had
developed
a
capacity
which
was
like
another
sense
for
finding
her
when
she
rode
on
his
domains
or
in
their
neighbourhood
and
she
was
surprised
to
feel
a
slight
annoyance
at
his
absence
an
annoyance
which
illogically
was
increased
by
the
sight
of
his
black
spaniel
the
sure
forerunner
of
his
master
making
his
way
through
the
hedge
a
moment
later
the
tall
figure
of
sales
himself
appeared
above
the
budding
twigs
he
greeted
her
in
the
somewhat
sulky
manner
to
which
she
was
accustomed
he
was
a
young
man
with
a
grievance
and
he
looked
at
her
as
though
it
were
personified
in
her
she
answered
him
cheerfully
a
wonderful
day
day
all
right
he
said
holding
the
primroses
to
her
nose
she
looked
round
catkins
were
swaying
lightly
on
the
willows
somewhere
out
of
sight
a
tiny
runnel
of
water
gurgled
the
horse
ate
noisily
the
grass
had
a
vividness
of
green
like
the
concentrated
thought
of
spring
do
see
how
anything
can
be
wrong
this
morning
she
said
you
lucky
to
think
so
he
answered
gazing
at
her
clear
pale
profile
she
turned
to
ask
patiently
is
the
matter
with
you
worried
a
cow
died
and
ignoring
his
angry
gesture
she
went
on
do
think
you
take
enough
care
of
your
property
whenever
i
ride
here
i
find
you
strolling
about
miserably
with
a
dog
your
fault
do
quite
see
why
she
said
pleasantly
no
doubt
you
are
right
but
has
a
cow
died
course
not
why
should
it
do
i
suppose
the
old
man
he
is
well
and
he
badgering
me
to
go
away
to
canada
and
learn
more
about
farming
you
should
course
you
say
so
do
you
think
you
ca
he
missed
or
ignored
her
point
ill
i
do
want
to
leave
him
and
in
a
louder
voice
he
added
almost
shouted
do
want
to
leave
you
her
grey
eyes
were
watching
the
swinging
catkins
her
hand
lifting
the
primroses
hid
a
smile
again
he
had
the
benefit
of
her
profile
the
knot
of
her
dark
thick
hair
and
the
shadowy
line
of
her
eyelashes
but
she
made
no
comment
on
his
remark
and
after
a
moment
of
sombre
staring
he
uttered
the
one
word
i
told
you
i
think
you
ought
to
go
you
do
love
me
from
under
her
raised
eyebrows
she
looked
at
him
steadily
i
do
love
you
she
said
slowly
there
was
no
need
to
consider
her
answer
she
was
sure
of
it
she
was
fond
of
him
but
she
could
not
romantically
love
some
one
who
looked
and
behaved
like
a
spoilt
boy
she
glanced
from
his
handsome
frowning
face
in
which
the
mouth
was
opening
for
protest
to
a
scene
perfectly
set
for
a
love
affair
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
sheep
in
sight
there
was
only
the
horse
who
careless
of
these
human
beings
still
ate
eagerly
chopping
the
good
grass
with
his
teeth
and
the
spaniel
who
panted
and
with
a
great
affectation
of
exhaustion
the
place
was
beautiful
and
the
sunlight
had
some
quality
of
enchantment
faint
delicious
smells
were
offered
on
the
wind
and
withdrawn
in
caprice
the
trees
were
all
tipped
with
green
and
interlaced
with
blue
air
and
blue
sky
she
wished
she
could
say
she
loved
him
and
she
repeated
her
denial
half
regretfully
he
pleaded
known
you
all
my
life
that
why
perhaps
i
know
you
too
well
do
you
do
know
how
how
i
love
you
and
i
should
be
different
with
you
i
should
be
happy
i
never
been
happy
yet
ca
she
said
slowly
happiness
through
a
person
if
you
ca
get
it
through
yourself
if
you
are
the
person
she
shook
her
head
sorry
i
ca
help
it
he
reproached
her
never
thought
about
it
is
that
the
same
thing
and
she
added
so
far
away
can
get
through
the
hedge
he
said
practically
she
smiled
in
the
way
that
always
puzzled
irritated
and
allured
him
his
words
set
him
still
farther
off
he
did
not
even
understand
her
speech
it
better
now
he
asked
close
to
her
no
better
she
looked
at
his
face
so
deeply
tanned
that
his
brown
hair
and
moustache
looked
pale
by
contrast
and
his
eyes
extraordinarily
blue
his
appearance
always
pleased
her
it
was
almost
a
part
of
the
landscape
but
the
landscape
was
full
of
change
of
mystery
in
spite
of
its
familiarity
and
she
found
him
dull
monotonous
with
a
sort
of
stupidity
which
was
not
without
attraction
but
which
would
be
wearying
for
a
whole
life
she
had
no
desire
to
be
his
wife
and
the
mistress
of
sales
hall
its
fields
and
woods
and
farms
the
world
was
big
the
possibilities
in
life
were
infinite
and
she
felt
she
was
fit
perhaps
destined
to
play
a
larger
part
than
this
he
offered
her
and
if
she
could
as
she
foresaw
only
play
a
greater
one
through
the
agency
of
some
man
she
must
have
that
man
colossal
for
she
was
only
years
old
she
said
firmly
are
not
suited
to
each
other
are
to
me
his
angry
helplessness
seemed
to
darken
the
sunlight
are
to
me
no
one
else
i
known
you
all
my
life
rose
think
about
it
shall
but
i
sha
change
i
do
believe
you
really
love
me
francis
but
you
want
some
one
you
can
growl
at
legitimately
i
think
you
would
find
me
satisfactory
another
woman
might
enjoy
the
privilege
he
made
a
wild
movement
startling
to
the
horse
do
understand
me
then
that
ought
to
settle
it
and
now
i
going
go
he
pleaded
look
here
you
might
have
loosened
your
girths
might
but
i
did
expect
to
be
here
so
long
i
did
expect
to
be
so
pleasantly
entertained
she
put
out
her
hand
for
his
shoulder
and
bending
unwillingly
he
received
her
foot
need
have
said
that
he
muttered
being
entertained
so
ungracious
francis
ca
help
it
when
i
care
so
much
from
her
high
seat
she
looked
at
him
with
a
sort
of
envy
must
be
rather
nice
to
feel
anything
deeply
enough
to
make
you
rude
torture
me
he
said
she
was
hurt
by
the
sight
of
his
suffering
she
wished
she
could
give
him
what
he
wanted
she
felt
as
though
she
were
injuring
a
child
yet
her
youth
resented
his
childishness
it
claimed
a
passion
capable
of
overwhelming
her
she
hardened
a
little
she
said
if
i
were
you
i
should
certainly
go
abroad
shall
he
threatened
her
then
she
repeated
amiably
go
he
begged
in
a
low
voice
i
do
believe
you
know
what
you
are
doing
and
you
always
loved
the
country
you
always
loved
our
place
you
like
our
house
you
told
me
once
you
envied
us
our
rookery
i
love
the
rookery
she
said
you
have
your
own
stables
and
as
many
horses
as
you
wanted
milk
from
our
own
cows
and
eggs
you
laughing
at
me
you
always
do
you
see
she
said
bending
a
little
towards
him
make
a
very
good
companion
i
could
put
up
with
it
from
you
he
cried
could
put
up
with
anything
from
you
she
made
a
gesture
that
was
where
he
chiefly
failed
the
colossal
gentleman
of
her
imagination
was
a
tyrant
she
rode
home
up
and
along
the
track
on
to
the
high
road
with
its
grass
borders
and
across
the
shadows
of
the
elm
branches
which
striped
the
road
with
black
it
was
a
long
road
accompanied
on
one
side
and
for
about
two
miles
by
a
tall
smooth
wall
unscalable
guarding
the
privacy
of
a
local
magnate
park
it
was
a
pitiless
wall
without
a
chink
without
a
roughness
that
could
be
seized
by
hands
it
was
higher
than
rose
mallett
as
she
sat
on
her
big
horse
and
but
for
the
open
fields
on
the
other
side
where
lambs
jumped
and
bleated
that
road
would
have
oppressed
the
spirit
for
the
wall
was
a
solid
witness
to
the
pride
and
the
power
of
material
possession
rose
mallett
hated
it
not
on
account
of
the
pride
and
the
power
but
because
it
was
ugly
monstrous
and
so
inhospitably
smooth
that
not
a
moss
would
grow
on
it
more
vaguely
she
disliked
it
because
it
set
so
definite
a
limit
to
her
path
she
was
always
glad
when
she
could
turn
the
corner
and
leaving
the
wall
to
prolong
the
side
of
the
right
angle
it
made
at
this
point
she
could
take
a
side
road
edging
a
wooded
slope
that
slope
made
one
side
of
the
gorge
through
which
the
river
ran
and
looking
down
through
the
trees
she
caught
glimpses
of
water
and
a
red
scar
of
rock
on
the
other
cliff
the
sound
of
a
steamer
paddles
threshing
the
water
came
to
her
clearly
and
the
crying
of
the
gulls
was
so
familiar
that
she
hardly
noticed
it
and
all
the
way
she
was
thinking
of
francis
sales
his
absurdity
his
good
looks
and
his
distress
but
in
the
permanence
of
his
distress
even
in
its
sincerity
she
did
not
much
believe
for
he
had
failed
to
touch
anything
but
her
pity
and
that
failure
seemed
an
argument
against
the
vehemence
of
his
love
yet
she
liked
him
she
had
always
liked
him
since
as
a
little
girl
she
had
been
taken
by
her
stepsisters
to
a
haymaking
party
at
sales
hall
they
had
gone
in
a
hired
carriage
but
one
so
smart
and
that
it
might
have
been
their
own
and
she
remembered
the
smell
of
the
leather
seats
warmed
by
the
sun
the
sound
of
the
horse
hoofs
and
the
sight
of
caroline
and
sophia
extremely
gay
in
their
summer
muslins
and
shady
hats
each
holding
a
lace
parasol
to
protect
the
complexion
already
delicately
touched
up
with
powder
and
rouge
she
had
been
very
proud
of
her
stepsisters
as
she
sat
facing
them
and
she
had
decided
to
wear
just
such
muslin
dresses
just
such
hats
when
she
grew
up
caroline
was
in
pink
with
coral
beads
and
a
pink
feather
drooping
on
her
dark
hair
and
sophia
very
fair
with
a
freckle
here
and
there
peeping
as
though
curious
through
the
powder
wore
yellow
with
a
sash
she
was
always
very
slim
and
the
only
fair
mallett
in
the
family
but
even
in
those
days
caroline
was
inclined
to
stoutness
she
carried
it
well
however
with
a
great
dignity
fortified
by
reassurances
from
sophia
and
rose
recollections
of
the
conversations
of
these
two
was
of
their
constant
compliments
to
each
other
and
the
tireless
discussion
of
clothes
these
conversations
still
went
on
fifteen
years
ago
she
had
sat
in
that
carriage
in
a
white
frock
with
socks
and
black
shoes
her
long
hair
flowing
down
her
back
and
she
had
heard
then
as
one
highly
privileged
the
words
she
would
hear
again
when
she
arrived
home
for
tea
under
their
tilted
parasols
they
had
made
their
little
speeches
no
one
was
more
distinguished
than
caroline
no
girl
of
twenty
had
a
prettier
figure
than
sophia
how
well
the
pink
feather
looked
against
hair
rose
listening
intently
but
not
staring
too
hard
lest
her
gaze
should
attract
their
attention
to
herself
had
looked
at
the
fields
and
at
the
high
smooth
wall
and
wondered
whether
she
would
rather
reach
sales
hall
and
enjoy
the
party
or
drive
on
for
ever
in
this
delightful
company
but
the
carriage
turned
up
the
avenue
of
elms
and
rose
saw
for
the
first
time
the
house
which
francis
sales
now
offered
as
an
attraction
it
was
a
big
square
house
with
honest
square
windows
and
the
drive
shadowed
by
the
elms
ran
through
the
fields
where
the
haymaking
was
in
progress
only
immediately
in
front
of
the
house
were
there
any
and
there
were
no
garden
trees
or
shrubs
the
effect
was
of
great
freedom
and
spaciousness
of
unaffected
homeliness
and
even
then
the
odd
delightful
mixture
of
hall
and
farm
the
grandeur
of
the
elm
avenue
set
in
the
simplicity
of
fields
gave
pleasure
to
rose
mallett
eyes
anything
might
happen
in
a
garden
that
suddenly
became
a
field
in
a
field
that
ended
in
a
garden
and
the
house
had
the
same
capacity
for
surprise
there
was
a
matted
hall
sunk
a
foot
below
the
threshold
and
to
rose
accustomed
to
the
delicate
order
of
nelson
lodge
with
its
slim
shining
old
furniture
its
polished
brass
and
gleaming
silver
the
comfortable
carelessness
of
this
place
with
a
man
cap
on
the
hall
table
a
group
of
sticks
and
a
pair
of
slippers
in
a
corner
and
an
opened
newspaper
on
a
chair
seemed
the
very
home
of
freedom
it
was
a
masculine
house
in
which
mrs
sales
a
gentle
lady
with
a
fichu
of
lace
round
her
soft
neck
looked
strangely
out
of
place
yet
entirely
happy
in
her
strangeness
on
the
day
of
the
party
rose
had
only
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
the
three
miss
malletts
caroline
sweeping
majestically
ahead
were
led
into
the
hayfield
where
mrs
sales
sat
serenely
in
a
wicker
chair
it
was
evident
at
once
that
mr
sales
bluff
and
hearty
with
gaitered
legs
was
fond
of
little
girls
he
realized
that
this
one
with
the
black
hair
and
the
solemn
grey
eyes
would
prefer
eating
strawberries
from
the
beds
to
partaking
of
them
with
cream
from
a
plate
he
knew
without
being
told
that
she
would
not
care
for
gambolling
with
other
children
in
the
hay
he
divined
her
desire
to
see
the
pigs
and
horses
and
it
was
near
the
pigsties
that
she
met
francis
sales
he
was
tall
for
twelve
years
old
and
rose
respected
him
for
his
age
and
size
but
she
wondered
why
he
was
with
the
pigs
instead
of
with
his
guests
to
whom
his
father
drove
him
off
with
a
laugh
he
ca
bear
parties
mr
sales
remarked
genially
to
rose
do
you
think
of
that
like
pigs
too
rose
answered
to
be
surprised
by
his
prolonged
chuckle
mr
sales
in
the
intervals
of
his
familiar
conversation
with
the
pigs
wanted
to
know
why
rose
had
not
brought
her
father
with
her
he
too
old
rose
said
rather
shocked
her
father
had
always
seemed
old
to
her
as
indeed
he
was
for
she
was
the
child
of
his
second
marriage
and
her
young
mother
had
died
when
she
was
born
her
stepsisters
devoted
to
the
little
girl
and
perhaps
not
altogether
sorry
to
be
rid
of
a
stepmother
younger
than
themselves
had
tried
to
make
up
for
that
loss
but
they
were
much
occupied
with
the
social
activities
of
radstowe
and
they
belonged
to
an
otherwise
inactive
generation
so
that
if
rose
had
a
grievance
it
was
that
they
never
played
games
with
her
never
ran
or
played
ball
or
bowled
hoops
as
she
saw
the
mothers
of
other
children
doing
for
such
sporting
she
had
to
rely
upon
her
nurse
who
was
of
rather
a
solemn
nature
and
liked
little
girls
to
behave
demurely
out
of
doors
general
mallett
saw
to
it
that
his
youngest
daughter
early
learnt
to
ride
her
memories
of
him
were
of
a
big
man
on
a
big
horse
not
talkative
somewhat
stern
and
sad
becoming
companionable
only
when
they
rode
out
together
on
the
high
downs
crowning
the
old
city
and
then
he
was
hardly
recognizable
as
the
father
who
heard
her
prayers
every
night
these
two
duties
of
teaching
her
to
ride
and
of
hearing
her
pray
and
his
insistence
on
her
going
as
caroline
and
sophia
had
done
to
a
convent
school
in
france
made
up
as
far
as
she
could
remember
the
sum
of
his
interest
in
her
and
when
she
returned
home
from
school
for
the
last
time
it
was
to
attend
his
funeral
she
was
hardly
sorry
she
was
certainly
not
glad
she
envied
the
spontaneous
tears
of
her
stepsisters
and
she
found
the
lugubriousness
of
the
occasion
much
alleviated
by
the
presence
of
her
stepbrother
reginald
she
had
hardly
seen
him
since
her
childhood
sophia
always
spoke
of
him
as
she
might
have
spoken
of
the
dead
caroline
sometimes
referred
to
him
in
good
round
terms
sometimes
with
an
indulgent
laugh
and
for
rose
he
had
the
charm
of
mystery
the
fascination
of
the
scapegrace
he
was
handsome
but
good
looks
were
a
prerogative
of
the
malletts
he
was
married
to
a
wife
he
had
never
introduced
to
his
family
and
he
had
a
little
girl
what
his
profession
was
rose
did
not
know
perhaps
his
face
was
his
fortune
as
certainly
his
sisters
had
been
his
victims
after
the
funeral
he
had
several
interviews
with
caroline
and
sophia
when
rose
could
hear
the
mannish
voice
of
caroline
growing
gruff
with
indignation
and
the
high
tones
of
sophia
rising
to
a
squeak
he
emerged
from
these
encounters
with
an
angry
face
and
a
weak
mouth
stubbornly
set
but
for
rose
he
had
always
a
gay
word
or
a
pretty
speech
she
was
a
real
mallett
he
told
her
she
was
more
his
sister
than
the
others
and
she
liked
to
hear
him
say
so
because
he
had
a
kind
of
grace
and
a
caressing
voice
yet
the
cool
judgment
which
was
never
easily
upset
assured
her
that
a
man
with
his
mouth
must
be
in
the
wrong
he
was
in
fact
pursuing
his
old
practice
of
extracting
money
from
his
sisters
and
he
only
returned
presumably
to
his
wife
and
child
when
james
batty
the
family
solicitor
had
been
called
to
the
ladies
aid
but
they
both
cried
when
he
went
away
is
so
lovable
sophia
sobbed
dear
he
a
rake
caroline
replied
carefully
dabbing
her
cheeks
the
malletts
are
rakes
yes
even
the
general
oh
he
took
to
religion
in
the
end
i
know
but
that
what
they
do
she
chuckled
there
nothing
left
i
afraid
i
shall
take
to
it
myself
some
day
i
sown
my
wild
oats
too
oh
no
i
not
going
to
tell
rose
anything
about
them
sophia
you
need
be
afraid
but
she
hear
of
them
sooner
or
later
from
anybody
who
remembers
caroline
mallett
in
her
youth
rose
had
received
this
confession
gravely
but
she
had
not
needed
the
reassurance
of
sophia
is
so
dear
rose
a
flirt
yes
but
never
wicked
never
my
dear
of
course
not
course
not
rose
repeated
she
had
already
realized
that
her
stepsisters
must
be
humoured
riding
slowly
rose
recalled
that
haymaking
party
and
her
gradual
friendship
as
the
years
went
by
with
the
unsociable
young
sales
a
friendship
which
had
been
tacitly
recognized
by
them
both
when
meeting
her
soon
after
his
mother
death
he
had
laid
his
arms
and
head
on
the
low
stone
wall
by
which
they
were
standing
and
wept
without
restraint
it
was
a
display
she
could
not
have
given
herself
and
it
shocked
her
in
a
young
man
but
it
left
her
in
his
debt
she
felt
she
owed
something
to
a
person
who
had
shown
such
confidence
in
her
and
though
at
the
time
she
had
been
dumb
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
far
from
helpful
she
did
not
forget
her
liability
however
she
could
not
remember
it
to
the
extent
of
marrying
him
she
had
always
shown
him
more
kindness
than
she
really
felt
and
in
considering
these
things
on
her
way
home
she
decided
that
she
was
still
doing
as
much
as
he
could
expect
she
had
by
this
time
turned
another
corner
and
the
high
bridge
swung
from
one
side
of
the
gorge
to
the
other
was
before
her
at
the
was
the
man
who
had
not
altered
in
the
whiteness
of
a
single
hair
since
she
had
been
taken
across
the
bridge
by
her
nurse
and
allowed
to
peep
fearfully
through
the
railings
which
had
towered
like
a
forest
above
her
head
and
the
view
from
the
bridge
was
still
for
her
a
fairy
vision
seawards
the
river
now
full
and
hiding
its
muddy
banks
which
revealed
had
their
own
opalescent
beauty
went
its
way
between
the
cliffs
clothed
on
one
hand
with
trees
save
for
a
big
red
and
yellow
gash
where
the
stone
was
being
quarried
and
on
the
other
with
bare
rock
topped
by
the
downs
spreading
far
out
of
sight
landwards
the
river
was
trapped
into
docks
spanned
by
low
bridges
and
made
into
the
glistening
part
of
a
patchwork
of
water
brick
and
iron
old
houses
once
the
haunts
of
fashion
were
clustered
near
the
water
but
divided
from
it
now
by
companion
anachronisms
to
the
steamers
entering
and
leaving
the
docks
but
by
the
farther
shore
one
small
strip
of
river
was
allowed
to
flow
in
its
own
way
and
it
skirted
meadows
rising
to
the
horizon
and
carrying
with
them
more
of
those
noble
elms
in
which
the
whole
countryside
was
rich
her
horse
hoofs
sounding
hollow
on
the
bridge
rose
passed
across
and
at
the
other
door
she
saw
the
thin
pale
man
with
spectacles
on
the
end
of
his
pointed
nose
who
had
first
touched
his
hat
to
her
when
she
rode
on
a
tiny
pony
by
the
side
of
her
father
on
his
big
horse
that
man
was
part
of
her
life
and
she
presumably
was
part
of
his
he
had
watched
many
upper
radstowe
children
from
the
perambulator
stage
and
to
him
she
remarked
on
the
weather
as
she
had
done
to
the
man
at
the
other
end
it
was
a
beautiful
day
they
were
having
a
wonderful
spring
it
would
soon
be
summer
she
said
but
on
repetition
these
words
sounded
false
and
intensely
dreary
it
would
soon
be
summer
but
what
did
that
mean
to
her
festivities
suited
to
the
season
would
be
resumed
in
radstowe
there
would
be
lawn
tennis
in
the
big
gardens
and
young
men
in
flannels
and
girls
in
white
would
stroll
about
the
roads
and
gay
voices
would
be
heard
in
the
dusk
there
would
be
and
batty
the
wife
of
the
lawyer
would
be
lavish
with
tennis
for
the
young
gossip
for
the
and
unlimited
strawberries
and
ices
for
all
rose
would
be
one
of
the
guests
at
this
as
at
all
the
parties
and
for
the
first
time
as
though
her
refusal
of
francis
sales
had
had
some
strange
effect
as
though
that
rejected
future
had
created
a
distaste
for
the
one
fronting
her
she
was
aghast
at
the
prospect
of
perpetual
chatter
tea
and
pretty
dresses
she
was
surely
meant
for
something
better
harder
demanding
greater
powers
she
had
by
inheritance
good
manners
a
certain
social
gift
but
she
had
here
nothing
to
conquer
with
these
weapons
what
was
she
to
do
the
idea
of
qualifying
for
the
business
of
earning
her
bread
did
not
occur
to
her
no
female
mallett
had
ever
done
such
a
thing
and
not
all
the
male
ones
marriage
opened
the
only
door
but
not
marriage
with
francis
sales
not
marriage
with
anyone
she
knew
in
radstowe
and
her
stepsisters
had
no
inclination
to
leave
the
home
of
their
youth
the
scene
of
their
past
successes
for
her
sake
rose
sat
very
straight
on
her
horse
not
frowning
for
she
never
frowned
but
wearing
rather
a
set
expression
so
that
an
acquaintance
passing
unrecognized
made
the
usual
reflection
on
the
youngest
miss
mallett
pride
and
the
pity
that
one
so
young
should
sometimes
look
so
old
and
rose
was
wishing
that
the
spring
would
last
for
ever
the
spring
with
its
promise
of
excitement
and
adventure
which
would
not
be
fulfilled
though
one
was
willingly
deceived
into
believing
that
it
would
yet
she
had
youth
happy
faith
in
accident
something
breathless
and
terrific
would
sweep
her
as
on
the
winds
of
storm
out
of
this
peaceful
gracious
life
this
place
where
feudalism
still
survived
where
men
touched
their
hats
to
her
as
her
due
and
it
was
her
due
she
raised
her
head
and
gave
her
pale
profile
to
the
houses
on
one
side
the
trees
and
the
open
spaces
of
green
on
the
other
and
not
because
she
was
a
mallett
though
it
was
a
name
honoured
in
radstowe
but
because
she
was
herself
hats
would
always
be
touched
to
her
and
it
was
the
touchers
who
would
feel
themselves
complimented
in
the
act
she
knew
that
but
the
knowledge
was
not
much
to
her
she
wished
she
could
offer
homage
for
a
change
and
the
colossal
figure
of
her
imagination
loomed
up
again
a
rough
man
perhaps
yes
he
might
be
rough
if
he
were
also
great
rough
and
the
scandal
of
her
stepsisters
as
she
rode
under
the
flowering
trees
to
the
stable
where
she
kept
her
horse
she
wondered
whether
she
should
tell
her
stepsisters
of
francis
sales
proposal
but
she
knew
she
would
not
do
so
she
seldom
told
them
anything
they
did
not
know
already
they
would
think
it
a
reasonable
match
they
might
urge
her
acceptance
they
were
anxious
for
her
to
marry
but
caroline
at
least
was
proud
of
the
inherent
mallett
distaste
for
the
marriage
state
all
flirts
she
would
say
for
the
thousandth
time
ca
settle
down
not
one
of
us
and
holding
up
a
thumb
and
forefinger
and
pinching
them
together
she
would
add
like
to
hold
men
hearts
like
that
and
let
them
go
it
was
great
nonsense
rose
thought
but
it
had
the
necessary
spice
of
truth
the
malletts
were
not
easily
pleased
and
they
were
not
good
givers
of
anything
except
gold
the
easiest
thing
to
give
rose
wished
she
could
give
the
difficult
things
love
devotion
and
but
she
could
not
or
perhaps
she
had
no
opportunity
she
was
fond
of
her
stepsisters
but
her
most
conscious
affection
was
the
one
she
felt
for
her
horse
she
left
him
at
the
stable
and
fastening
up
her
she
walked
slowly
home
she
had
not
far
to
go
a
steep
street
where
old
houses
informed
the
public
that
apartments
were
to
be
let
within
brought
her
to
the
broad
space
of
grass
and
trees
called
the
green
which
she
had
just
passed
on
her
horse
straight
ahead
of
her
was
the
wide
street
flanked
by
houses
of
which
her
home
was
one
a
low
white
building
hemmed
in
on
each
side
by
another
and
with
a
small
walled
garden
in
front
of
it
not
a
large
house
but
one
full
of
character
and
of
quiet
malletts
had
lived
in
it
for
several
generations
long
before
the
opposite
houses
were
built
long
before
the
road
had
lower
down
degenerated
into
a
region
of
shops
these
houses
all
rechristened
in
a
day
of
enthusiasm
nelson
lodge
with
trafalgar
house

bigger
but
not
so
white
on
one
side
of
it
and

smaller
on
the
other

meadows

boyhood
round
the
corner
facing
the
green
were
a
few
contemporaries
and
they
all
had
a
slight
look
of
disdain
for
the
later
comers
yet
no
single
house
was
flagrantly
new
there
was
not
a
villa
in
sight
and
on
the
green
two
old
stone
monuments
to
and
warriors
kept
company
with
the
old
trees
under
which
children
were
now
playing
while
nurses
wheeled
perambulators
on
the
bisecting
paths
the
green
itself
sloped
upwards
until
it
became
a
hill
once
a
british
or
a
roman
camp
and
thence
the
river
could
be
seen
between
its
rocky
cliffs
and
the
woods
rose
had
lately
skirted
clothing
the
farther
side
in
every
shade
of
green
she
lingered
for
a
moment
to
watch
the
children
playing
the
nursemaids
slowly
pushing
the
elms
opening
their
crumpled
leaves
like
babies
hands
she
had
a
momentary
desire
to
stay
to
wander
round
the
hill
and
look
with
untired
eyes
at
the
familiar
scene
but
she
passed
on
under
the
tyranny
of
tea
the
malletts
were
always
in
time
for
meals
and
the
meals
were
exquisite
like
the
polish
on
the
old
brass
like
the
furniture
in
the
white
panelled
hall
like
the
beautiful
old
mahogany
in
the
the
old
china
the
glass
bowls
full
of
flowers
rose
found
caroline
and
sophia
there
on
either
side
of
a
small
wood
fire
while
facing
the
fire
and
spread
in
a
chair
not
too
low
and
not
too
narrow
for
her
bulk
sat
batty
flushed
costumed
for

her
hat
a
flower
garden
in
time
caroline
said
the
bell
please
sophia
saw
me
rose
said
and
the
elderly
parlourmaid
entered
at
that
moment
with
the
teapot
insists
on
having
a
latchkey
sophia
explained
would
the
general
have
said
indeed
caroline
echoed
rakes
are
always
old

yes
the
general
was
a
rake
sophia
you
need
look
so
modest

i
understand
men
yes
caroline
no
one
better
but
we
are
told
to
honour
our
father
and
mother
i
do
honour
him
caroline
guffawed
him
all
the
more
she
had
a
deep
voice
and
a
deep
laugh
she
ought
she
always
said
to
have
been
a
man
but
there
was
nothing
masculine
about
her
appearance
her
dark
hair
carefully
tinted
where
greyness
threatened
was
piled
in
many
puffs
above
a
curly
fringe
on
the
bodice
of
her
flounced
silk
frock
there
hung
a
heavy
golden
chain
and
locket
dangled
from
her
large
ears
there
were
rings
on
her
fingers
and
powder
and
a
hint
of
rouge
on
her
face
she
laughed
again
batty
knows
i
right
batty
tightly
gloved
hand
made
a
movement
she
was
a
little
in
awe
of
the
miss
malletts
with
them
she
was
always
conscious
of
her
inferior
descent
no
general
had
ever
ornamented
her
family
and
her
marriage
with
james
batty
had
been
a
giddy
elevation
for
her
but
she
was
by
no
means
humble
she
had
her
place
in
local
society
she
had
a
fine
house
in
that
exclusive
part
of
radstowe
called
the
slope
and
her
husband
was
a
member
of
the
oldest
firm
of
lawyers
in
the
city
are
very
naughty
miss
caroline
she
said
knowing
that
was
the
remark
looked
for
she
gave
a
little
nod
of
her
head
we
just
got
to
put
up
with
them
whatever
they
are
yes
poor
dears
sophia
murmured
different
they
ca
help
it
caroline
retorted
just
the
same
there
nothing
to
choose
between
me
and
reginald
nothing
except
discretion
caroline
dear
sophia
entreated
caroline
repeated
firmly
and
batty
bending
forward
stiffly
because
of
her
constricting
clothes
and
with
a
creak
and
rustle
ventured
to
ask
in
low
tones
you
any
news
of
mallett
lately
the
three
elder
ladies
murmured
together
rose
indifferent
concerned
with
her
own
thoughts
ate
a
creamy
cake
this
was
one
of
the
conversations
she
had
heard
before
and
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
listen
she
was
roused
by
the
departure
of
batty
thing
caroline
remarked
as
the
door
closed
a
pity
she
has
no
daughter
with
an
eye
for
colour
the
roses
in
her
hat
were
pale
in
comparison
with
her
face
why
does
she
use
a
little
powder
though
i
suppose
that
would
turn
her
purple
and
after
all
she
does
very
well
considering
what
she
is
but
why
why
did
james
batty
marry
her
and
he
was
one
of
our
own
friends
you
remember
the
sensation
at
the
time
sophia
sophia
remembered
very
well
was
a
pretty
girl
caroline
and
she
has
lost
her
looks
but
she
still
has
a
kind
heart
i
would
rather
keep
my
looks
said
caroline
touching
her
fringe
before
the
mirror
i
never
had
a
kind
heart
to
cherish
tenderly
sophia
shook
her
head
is
true
she
whispered
to
rose
kindest
in
the
world
it
just
her
way
rose
nodded
understanding
then
she
stood
up
tall
and
slim
in
her
severe
clothes
her
high
boots
the
gilt
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
said
it
was
only
five
there
were
five
more
hours
before
she
could
reasonably
go
to
bed
did
you
ride
dear
sophia
asked
the
bridge
and
to
dissipate
some
of
her
boredom
she
added
met
francis
sales
he
thinks
of
going
abroad
there
was
an
immediate
confusion
of
little
exclamations
and
a
chatter
abroad
why
learn
farming
dear
sophia
sighed
we
thought
we
hoped
must
do
as
she
likes
caroline
said
and
rose
smiled
malletts
do
care
for
marrying
look
at
us
free
as
the
air
and
with
plenty
of
amusing
memories
in
this
world
nobody
gets
more
than
that
and
we
have
been
saved
much
trouble
do
marry
my
dear
rose
assuming
a
good
deal
rose
said
rose
is
not
like
us
sophia
protested
have
each
other
but
we
shall
die
before
she
does
and
leave
her
lonely
she
ought
to
marry
caroline
we
ought
to
have
more
parties
we
are
not
doing
our
duty
no
rose
said
have
enough
of
them
if
you
threaten
me
with
more
i
shall
go
into
a
convent
caroline
laughed
and
sophia
sighed
again
would
be
beautiful
she
said
how
dare
you
sophia
persisted
mildly
romantic
a
young
girl
giving
up
all
for
god
and
caroline
gave
the
ribald
laugh
on
which
she
prided
herself
a
shocking
sound
mallett
sophia
went
on
so
lost
in
her
vision
that
the
jarring
laughter
was
not
heard
a
pretty
name
a
nun
she
would
never
be
forgotten
people
would
tell
their
children
sister
rose
she
developed
her
idea
rose
it
as
pretty
as
saint
cecilia
prettier
you
in
your
dotage
caroline
cried
mallett
and
a
nun
well
she
could
pray
for
the
rest
of
us
i
suppose
i
would
rather
you
were
married
dear
sophia
said
serenely
we
have
known
the
sales
all
our
lives
it
would
have
been
so
suitable
dull
rose
murmured
we
need
praying
for
caroline
said
be
dull
either
way
rose
have
your
fling
as
i
did
i
never
regretted
it
i
was
the
talk
of
radstowe
was
i
sophia
there
was
never
a
ball
where
i
was
not
looked
for
and
when
i
entered
the
ballroom
she
gave
a
display
of
how
she
did
it
was
a
rush
of
black
coats
and
white
shirts
a
mob
i
used
just
to
wave
them
all
away
like
that
oh
yes
sophia
you
were
a
belle
too
never
as
you
were
caroline
were
admired
for
yourself
sophia
but
with
me
it
was
curiosity
they
only
wanted
to
hear
what
i
should
say
next
i
had
a
tongue
like
a
lash
they
were
afraid
of
it
yes
sophia
said
hastily
and
she
glanced
at
rose
afraid
of
meeting
scepticism
in
her
clear
young
eyes
but
though
rose
was
smiling
it
was
not
in
mockery
she
was
thinking
of
her
childhood
when
like
a
happier
cinderella
she
had
seen
her
stepsisters
in
satins
and
laces
with
pendant
fans
and
glittering
jewels
excited
rustling
with
little
words
of
commendation
for
each
other
setting
out
for
the
evening
parties
of
which
they
never
tired
they
had
always
kissed
her
before
they
went
looking
she
used
to
think
as
beautiful
as
princesses
men
like
what
they
fear
caroline
added
dear
sophia
said
a
natural
flush
appeared
round
the
delicate
dabs
of
rouge
she
hoped
she
might
be
forgiven
for
her
tender
deceits
those
young
men
in
the
white
waistcoats
had
often
laughed
at
caroline
rather
than
at
her
wit
she
was
as
sophia
had
shrinkingly
divined
as
often
as
not
their
butt
and
dear
caroline
had
never
known
it
she
must
never
know
it
never
know
it
she
drew
half
her
happiness
from
the
past
as
so
differently
sophia
did
herself
and
drooping
a
little
her
thoughts
went
farther
back
to
the
last
year
of
her
teens
when
a
pale
and
penniless
young
man
had
been
her
secret
suitor
had
gone
to
america
to
make
his
fortune
there
and
died
she
had
told
no
one
caroline
would
have
scorned
him
because
he
was
shy
and
timid
and
he
had
not
had
time
to
earn
enough
to
keep
her
he
had
not
had
time
she
had
a
faded
photograph
of
him
pushed
away
at
the
back
of
a
drawer
of
the
walnut
bureau
in
the
bedroom
she
shared
with
caroline
a
pale
young
man
wearing
a
collar
too
large
for
his
thin
neck
a
young
man
with
kind
honest
eyes
it
was
a
grief
to
her
that
she
could
not
wear
that
photograph
in
a
locket
near
her
heart
but
caroline
would
have
found
out
they
had
slept
in
the
same
bed
since
they
were
children
and
nothing
could
be
hidden
from
her
except
the
love
she
still
cherished
in
her
heart
some
day
she
meant
to
burn
that
photograph
lest
unsympathetic
hands
should
touch
it
when
she
died
but
death
still
seemed
far
off
and
sometimes
even
while
she
was
talking
to
caroline
she
would
pretend
to
rummage
in
the
drawer
and
for
a
moment
she
would
close
her
hand
upon
the
photograph
to
tell
him
she
had
not
forgotten
she
loved
her
little
romance
and
the
gaiety
in
which
she
had
persisted
even
on
the
day
when
she
heard
of
his
death
and
which
at
first
had
seemed
a
necessary
but
cruel
disloyalty
had
become
in
her
mind
the
tenderest
of
concealments
as
though
she
had
wrapped
her
secret
in
beauty
laughter
music
and
shining
garments
yes
dear
rose
she
said
lifting
her
head
must
be
married
the
outward
life
of
the
mallett
household
was
elegant
and
ordered
footsteps
fell
quietly
on
the
carpeted
stairs
and
passages
doors
were
quietly
opened
and
closed
the
cook
and
the
parlourmaid
were
old
and
trusted
servants
the
house
and
kitchen
maids
were
respectable
young
women
fitting
themselves
for
promotion
and
their
service
was
given
with
the
thoroughness
and
deference
to
which
the
malletts
were
accustomed
in
the
whole
house
there
was
hardly
an
object
without
beauty
or
tradition
the
notable
exception
being
the
portrait
of
general
mallett
which
hung
above
the
sheraton
sideboard
in
the
a
gloomy
daub
honoured
for
the
general
sake
from
the
white
panelled
hall
the
staircase
with
its
white
banisters
and
smooth
mahogany
rail
led
to
a
square
landing
which
branched
off
narrowly
on
two
sides
and
opening
from
the
square
were
the
bedroom
occupied
by
rose
the
one
shared
by
her
stepsisters
and
the
one
which
had
been
reginald
this
room
was
never
used
but
it
was
kept
like
everything
else
in
that
house
in
a
state
of
cleanliness
and
polish
ready
for
his
arrival
he
might
come
if
he
needed
money
badly
enough
he
would
come
and
in
spite
of
the
already
considerable
depletion
of
their
capital
caroline
and
sophia
lived
in
hope
of
hearing
his
impatient
assault
of
the
the
brass
head
of
a
lion
holding
a
heavy
ring
in
his
mouth
rose
too
wished
he
would
come
but
that
last
interview
with
the
lawyer
batty
had
been
more
successful
than
anyone
but
the
lawyer
himself
had
wished
and
there
was
no
knock
no
letter
no
news
the
usual
life
of
parties
calls
and
concerts
continued
without
any
excitement
but
that
felt
by
caroline
and
sophia
in
the
getting
of
new
clothes
the
refurbishing
of
old
ones
the
hearing
of
the
latest
gossip
the
reading
of
the
latest
novel
sophia
sometimes
apologized
for
the
books
lying
about
the
by
saying
that
she
and
dear
caroline
liked
to
keep
up
their
french
but
caroline
loudly
proclaimed
her
taste
for
salacious
literature
she
had
a
reputation
to
keep
up
and
she
liked
to
shock
her
friends
but
everything
was
forgiven
to
miss
mallett
the
more
readily
perhaps
after
sophia
reassuring
whisper
are
really
charming
books
quite
beautiful
nothing
anybody
could
disapprove
of
why
there
is
hardly
an
episode
to
make
one
shrink
though
of
course
the
french
are
different
and
the
radstowe
ladies
would
nod
over
their
tea
and
say
course
quite
different
but
caroline
suspecting
that
murmured
explanation
had
been
known
to
call
out
in
her
harsh
voice
no
good
asking
sophia
about
them
she
simply
does
understand
the
best
bits
she
is
still
she
always
will
be
sophia
blushing
a
little
would
feel
herself
richly
complimented
and
the
ladies
laughed
batty
uncertainly
having
no
acquaintance
with
the
french
language
rose
read
steadily
through
all
the
books
in
the
house
and
gained
a
various
knowledge
which
left
her
curiously
untouched
she
studied
music
and
liked
it
better
than
anything
else
because
it
roused
emotions
otherwise
unobtainable
yet
she
did
not
care
much
for
the
emotional
kind
perhaps
her
intensest
feeling
was
the
desire
to
feel
intensely
but
being
half
ashamed
of
this
desire
she
rarely
dwelt
on
it
she
pursued
her
way
calm
and
aloof
and
proud
she
was
beautiful
and
found
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
herself
and
though
she
did
not
discuss
her
appearance
as
her
stepsisters
discussed
theirs
she
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
on
it
and
much
money
on
her
plain
but
perfect
clothes
all
three
had
more
money
than
they
needed
but
rose
was
richer
than
the
others
having
inherited
her
mother
little
fortune
as
well
as
her
share
of
what
the
general
had
left
she
was
as
caroline
often
told
her
with
a
hit
at
that
gentleman
unnecessary
impartiality
a
very
desirable
match
they
afraid
of
you
my
dear
they
were
afraid
of
me
but
i
amused
them
while
you
simply
look
as
if
they
were
not
there
of
course
that
attractive
in
its
way
and
one
must
follow
one
own
line
but
it
takes
a
brave
man
to
come
up
to
the
scratch
what
an
expression
i
want
a
brave
man
rose
said
i
want
one
at
all
caroline
turned
on
sophia
language
for
except
to
express
oneself
you
out
of
date
sophia
you
always
were
and
i
always
been
ahead
of
my
time
now
rose
these
personalities
were
dear
to
caroline
belongs
to
no
time
at
all
that
frightens
them
they
do
understand
you
ca
imagine
a
radstowe
young
man
making
love
to
the
sphinx
they
were
more
daring
when
i
was
young
look
at
reginald
look
at
the
general
was
his
profession
rose
remarked
i
suppose
that
what
he
told
himself
when
he
married
your
mother
a
mere
girl
no
older
than
myself
but
he
was
afraid
of
her
and
adored
her
i
believe
men
always
like
their
second
wives
best
they
flattered
at
succeeding
in
getting
two
i
know
men
our
own
mother
was
pious
and
made
him
go
to
church
but
with
your
mother
he
looked
as
if
he
were
in
a
temple
all
the
time
those
big
stern
men
are
always
managed
by
their
women
it
the
thin
men
with
weak
legs
who
really
go
their
own
way
sophia
sighed
do
know
how
you
think
of
such
things
is
that
an
epigram
do
know
caroline
said
i
should
be
surprised
smiling
in
her
mysterious
way
rose
left
the
room
and
sophia
slightly
pink
with
anxiety
murmured
there
no
one
in
radstowe
really
fit
for
her
do
you
think
we
ought
to
go
about
perhaps
to
london
or
abroad
not
going
to
budge
caroline
said
love
my
home
and
i
believe
in
matchmaking
i
do
believe
in
marriage
it
would
do
her
any
good
but
if
you
feel
like
that
why
do
you
exploit
her
yourself
exploit
certainly
not
and
you
know
i
could
leave
you
do
talk
nonsense
caroline
said
and
the
life
at
nelson
lodge
went
on
as
before
every
day
rose
rode
out
sometimes
early
in
the
morning
on
the
downs
when
nobody
was
about
and
she
had
them
to
herself
but
oftener
across
the
bridge
into
the
other
county
where
the
atmosphere
and
the
look
of
things
were
immediately
different
softer
more
subtle
yet
more
exhilarating
she
went
there
now
with
no
fear
of
meeting
francis
sales
he
had
gone
to
canada
without
another
word
and
his
absence
made
him
interesting
for
the
first
time
if
she
had
not
been
bored
in
a
delicate
way
of
her
own
which
left
no
mark
but
an
expression
of
impassivity
she
would
not
have
thought
of
him
at
all
but
the
days
went
by
and
summer
passed
into
autumn
and
autumn
was
threatened
by
winter
with
so
little
change
beyond
the
coming
and
going
of
flowers
and
leaves
and
birds
that
her
mind
began
to
fix
itself
on
a
man
who
loved
her
to
the
point
of
disgust
and
departure
and
to
her
love
of
the
country
round
about
sales
hall
was
added
a
tender
sentiment
once
or
twice
she
rode
up
to
the
hall
itself
and
paid
a
visit
to
mr
sales
who
crippled
by
rheumatism
and
half
suffocated
by
asthma
was
hardly
recognizable
as
the
man
who
had
shown
her
the
pigs
long
ago
in
the
little
room
called
the
study
where
there
was
not
a
single
book
or
in
the
big
clear
of
pale
chintzes
and
faded
he
entertained
her
with
the
ceremony
due
to
a
very
beautiful
and
dignified
young
woman
producing
the
latest
letter
from
his
son
and
reading
extracts
from
it
sometimes
there
was
a
photograph
of
francis
on
a
horse
francis
with
a
dog
or
francis
at
a
steam
plough
or
other
agricultural
machine
but
these
she
only
pretended
to
examine
she
had
not
the
least
desire
to
see
how
he
looked
for
in
these
last
months
she
had
made
a
picture
of
her
own
and
she
would
not
have
it
overlaid
by
any
other
it
was
a
game
of
pretence
she
knew
she
was
wasting
her
time
she
had
her
youth
and
strength
and
money
and
limitless
opportunity
for
wide
experience
but
her
very
youth
and
the
feeling
that
it
would
last
for
ever
made
her
careless
of
it
there
was
plenty
of
time
she
could
afford
to
waste
it
and
gradually
that
occupation
became
a
habit
almost
an
absorption
she
warned
herself
that
she
must
shake
it
off
but
the
effort
would
leave
her
very
bare
it
would
rob
her
of
the
fairy
cloak
which
made
her
inner
self
invisible
and
she
clung
to
it
secure
in
her
ability
to
be
rid
of
it
if
she
chose
her
intellect
made
no
mistake
about
francis
sales
but
her
imagination
finding
occupation
where
it
could
began
to
endow
him
with
romance
and
that
scene
among
the
primroses
the
startlingly
green
grass
the
pervading
blue
of
the
air
the
horse
so
indifferent
to
the
human
drama
the
dog
trying
to
understand
it
became
the
salient
event
of
her
life
because
it
had
awakened
her
capacity
for
dreaming
she
did
not
love
him
she
could
never
love
him
but
he
had
loved
her
angrily
and
in
retrospect
the
absurd
manner
of
his
proposal
had
a
charm
she
would
have
given
much
to
know
whether
his
feeling
for
her
persisted
from
the
letters
read
wheezily
by
mr
sales
and
sometimes
handed
to
her
to
read
for
herself
she
learnt
so
little
that
she
was
the
freer
to
create
a
great
deal
and
riding
home
she
would
break
into
astonished
inward
laughter
rose
mallett
playing
a
game
of
sentiment
and
crossing
the
bridge
and
passing
through
the
streets
where
she
was
known
to
every
second
person
she
had
pleasure
in
the
conviction
that
no
one
could
have
guessed
what
absurdity
went
on
behind
the
pale
impassive
face
what
secret
and
unsuspected
amusement
she
enjoyed
a
little
comedy
of
her
own
the
unsuitability
of
francis
sales
for
the
part
of
hero
supplied
most
of
the
humour
and
saved
her
from
loss
of
dignity
the
thing
was
obviously
absurd
she
had
never
cared
for
dolls
but
in
her
young
womanhood
she
was
finding
amusement
in
the
manipulation
of
a
puppet
the
death
of
mr
sales
in
the
cold
march
of
the
next
year
shocked
her
from
her
game
she
was
sorry
he
had
gone
for
she
had
always
liked
him
and
he
seemed
to
have
taken
with
him
the
little
girl
who
was
fond
of
pigs
and
while
caroline
and
sophia
mourned
the
loss
of
an
old
friend
rose
was
faced
with
the
certainty
of
his
son
return
she
would
have
to
stop
her
ridiculous
imaginings
she
must
pretend
she
had
never
had
them
for
when
she
saw
him
as
flesh
and
blood
her
game
would
be
ruined
and
she
would
be
shamed
the
imminence
of
his
arrival
reminded
her
of
his
dullness
his
handsome
sullen
face
and
more
tenderly
of
those
tears
which
had
put
her
so
oddly
in
his
debt
but
she
had
no
difficulty
in
casting
away
the
false
image
she
had
made
she
was
she
found
glad
to
be
rid
of
it
she
liked
to
feel
herself
delivered
of
a
weakness
but
she
need
not
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
for
it
was
some
months
before
the
man
who
brought
the
milk
from
sales
hall
also
brought
the
news
that
the
master
was
returning
this
information
was
handed
to
caroline
and
sophia
with
their
early
tea
sitting
up
in
bed
and
looking
grotesquely
terrible
they
discussed
the
event
caroline
like
medusa
but
with
hair
curlers
instead
of
snakes
sprouting
from
her
head
and
sophia
with
her
heavy
plait
hanging
over
her
shoulder
and
defying
with
its
luxuriance
the
yellowness
of
her
skin
they
sat
side
by
side
propped
up
with
pillows
inured
to
the
sight
of
each
other
in
undress
has
come
back
sophia
said
ecstatically
after
all
nonsense
caroline
said
as
usual
meant
for
better
things
my
dear
she
was
born
for
a
great
affair
she
ought
to
be
the
mistress
of
a
king
yes
something
of
that
kind
with
her
looks
her
phlegm
there
are
no
kings
in
radstowe
sophia
said
i
do
think
you
ought
to
say
such
things
my
way
you
ought
to
know
that
and
i
ca
control
my
tongue
any
more
than
reginald
can
control
his
body
i
do
want
to
we
all
wrapped
up
in
nowadays
i
ought
to
have
lived
in
another
century
i
too
would
have
adorned
a
court
and
kept
it
lively
there
no
wit
left
in
the
world
and
there
no
wickedness
of
the
right
kind
we
might
as
well
be
nonconformists
at
once
not
sophia
said
firmly
not
that
as
you
so
cleverly
remind
me
there
are
no
kings
in
radstowe
there
not
even
she
added
with
a
mocking
smile
which
made
her
face
gay
in
a
ghastly
way
even
a
foreign
count
who
would
turn
out
an
impostor
rose
would
do
very
well
there
too
an
imitation
foreign
count
with
a
black
moustache
and
no
money
she
would
be
magnificent
and
tragic
imagine
them
at
monte
carlo
keeping
it
up
she
would
hate
him
grandly
she
would
hate
herself
for
being
deceived
she
would
never
lose
her
dignity
you
ca
picture
rose
with
a
droop
or
a
tear
they
trail
about
the
continent
and
she
would
never
come
back
we
do
want
her
to
go
away
at
all
sophia
cried
when
she
came
to
the
point
of
being
afraid
of
murdering
him
she
would
leave
him
without
any
fuss
and
live
alone
and
mysterious
somewhere
in
the
south
of
france
or
italy
or
spain
yes
spain
there
must
be
real
counts
there
and
she
would
get
her
love
affair
at
last
she
would
still
be
married
course
caroline
looking
roguish
was
terrible
is
necessary
for
a
love
affair
would
much
rather
she
married
francis
sales
and
came
to
see
us
every
week
or
any
other
nice
young
man
in
radstowe
she
would
never
marry
beneath
her
the
contrary
caroline
remarked
bound
to
marry
beneath
her
not
in
class
sophia
not
in
class
though
in
radstowe
possible
too
look
at
the
battys
but
certainly
in
brains
and
manners
sophia
clinging
to
her
own
idea
repeated
plaintively
would
rather
it
were
francis
sales
and
he
must
be
lonely
in
that
big
house
it
appeared
however
that
he
was
not
to
be
lonely
for
susan
entering
with
hot
water
let
fall
in
her
discreet
impersonal
way
another
piece
of
gossip
gibbs
says
they
think
francis
must
be
bringing
home
a
wife
miss
caroline
he
having
some
of
the
rooms
done
up
said
caroline
and
her
plump
elbow
pressed
sophia
rooms
i
wonder
did
not
inquire
miss
caroline
kindly
inquire
this
afternoon
and
tell
him
the
butter
is
deteriorating
but
inquire
first
or
you
get
nothing
out
of
him
she
turned
with
malicious
triumph
to
sophia
that
dream
over
shall
have
to
break
it
to
her
gently
sophia
said
it
may
not
be
true
in
the
over
which
the
general
portrait
tried
and
failed
to
preside
as
he
himself
had
done
in
life
and
where
he
was
conquered
by
an
earlier
and
a
later
generation
by
the
shining
eloquence
of
the
old
furniture
and
silver
and
the
living
flesh
and
blood
of
his
children
caroline
gave
rose
the
news
without
sophia
thought
a
spark
of
delicacy
say
francis
sales
is
bringing
home
a
wife
rose
said
taking
toast
has
sent
orders
for
part
of
the
house
to
be
done
up
rose
raised
her
eyes
she
hurt
sophia
thought
but
rose
merely
said
he
touches
the
or
the
study
i
shall
never
forgive
him
and
then
thoughtfully
she
added
he
touch
the
he
do
what
his
wife
tells
him
i
imagine
no
girl
will
appreciate
mrs
sales
washy
paintings
would
sophia
sighed
i
do
rose
said
cheerfully
she
was
too
cheerful
for
romantic
little
theory
but
an
acuter
audience
would
have
found
her
too
cheerful
for
herself
she
had
overdone
it
by
half
a
tone
but
the
exaggeration
was
too
fine
for
any
ears
but
her
own
she
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
grip
of
a
violent
anger
she
was
not
the
kind
of
woman
to
resent
the
new
affections
of
a
rejected
lover
but
she
had
through
her
own
folly
attached
herself
to
francis
sales
as
less
unreasonably
his
tears
had
once
attached
him
to
her
and
the
immaterial
nature
of
the
bond
composed
its
strength
consciously
foolish
as
her
thoughts
had
been
they
became
at
that
breakfast
table
with
the
water
bubbling
in
the
spirit
kettle
and
the
faint
crunch
of
caroline
eating
toast
intensely
real
and
she
was
angry
both
with
herself
and
with
his
unfaithfulness
she
did
not
love
him
how
could
she
but
he
belonged
to
her
and
now
if
this
piece
of
gossip
turned
out
to
be
true
she
must
share
him
with
another
jealousy
in
its
usual
sense
she
had
none
as
yet
but
she
had
forged
a
chain
she
was
to
find
herself
unable
to
break
it
was
her
pride
to
consider
herself
a
hard
young
person
without
spirituality
without
sentiment
yet
all
her
personal
relationships
were
to
be
of
the
fantastic
kind
she
now
experienced
all
her
obligations
such
as
others
would
have
ignored
shall
know
more
when
john
gibbs
brings
the
afternoon
milk
caroline
said
rose
went
upstairs
and
left
her
stepsisters
to
their
repetitions
her
window
looked
out
on
the
little
walled
front
garden
and
the
broad
street
tradesmen
carts
went
by
without
hurry
ladies
walked
out
with
their
dogs
loitered
in
the
sun
and
presently
caroline
and
sophia
went
down
the
garden
path
caroline
sailing
majestically
like
a
ship
sophia
with
her
girlish
tripping
gait
they
put
up
their
sunshades
and
sailed
out
on
what
was
in
effect
a
foraging
expedition
they
were
going
to
collect
the
news
outside
the
gate
they
were
hidden
by
the
wall
but
for
a
little
while
rose
could
hear
caroline
loud
voice
without
doubt
she
was
talking
of
francis
sales
unless
she
were
asking
sophia
if
her
hat
a
large
one
with
pink
roses
really
became
her
rose
knew
it
all
so
well
and
she
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
in
weariness
suddenly
she
felt
tired
and
old
the
flame
of
her
anger
had
died
down
and
for
that
moment
she
allowed
herself
to
droop
she
found
little
comfort
in
the
fact
that
she
alone
knew
of
her
folly
and
calling
it
folly
no
longer
justified
it
she
too
had
been
rejected
more
cruelly
than
had
francis
sales
for
she
had
given
him
something
of
her
spirit
and
she
had
liked
to
imagine
him
far
away
thinking
of
her
and
of
her
beauty
she
had
fancied
him
remembering
the
scene
among
the
primroses
and
continuing
to
adore
her
in
his
sulky
inarticulate
way
well
he
would
think
of
her
no
more
but
she
was
subtly
bound
to
him
first
by
his
need
and
now
against
all
reason
by
her
thoughts
she
had
already
learnt
that
time
which
sometimes
seems
so
swift
and
heartless
is
also
slow
and
kind
her
feelings
would
lose
their
intensity
she
only
had
to
wait
and
she
waited
with
that
outward
impassivity
which
did
not
spoil
her
beauty
it
suited
the
firm
modelling
of
her
features
the
creamy
whiteness
of
her
skin
the
clear
grey
eyes
under
the
straight
dark
eyebrows
and
the
lips
bent
into
the
promise
of
a
smile
caroline
and
sophia
waited
differently
first
for
the
afternoon
milk
and
the
information
they
wanted
and
during
the
next
weeks
for
the
rumours
which
slowly
developed
into
acknowledged
facts
the
housekeeper
at
sales
hall
had
heard
from
the
young
master
he
was
married
and
returning
immediately
with
his
wife
caroline
sniffed
and
hoped
the
woman
was
respectable
sophia
was
charitably
certain
she
would
be
a
charming
girl
and
rose
knowing
she
questioned
one
of
the
life
occupations
of
her
stepsisters
said
coolly
speculate
we
shall
see
her
soon
we
must
go
and
call
course
caroline
said
and
sophia
with
her
fixed
idea
which
was
right
in
the
wrong
way
said
gently
you
sure
you
want
to
go
dear
asked
caroline
no
i
was
thinking
of
rose
caroline
said
all
going
and
rose
reassured
sophia
with
perfect
truth
have
been
longing
to
see
her
for
weeks
so
it
came
about
that
the
three
sisters
once
more
sat
in
a
hired
carriage
and
drove
to
sales
hall
on
the
box
was
the
son
of
the
man
who
had
driven
them
years
ago
and
though
the
carriage
was
a
new
one
and
the
old
horse
had
long
been
metamorphosed
into
food
for
the
wild
animals
in
the
radstowe
zoo
this
expedition
was
in
many
ways
a
repetition
of
the
other
caroline
and
sophia
faced
the
horses
and
rose
sat
opposite
her
stepsisters
but
now
she
did
not
listen
to
their
talk
with
ears
stretched
not
to
miss
a
word
and
she
did
not
think
her
companions
as
beautiful
as
princesses
it
was
she
who
might
have
been
a
princess
for
another
child
but
she
did
not
think
of
that
she
looked
with
amusement
and
with
misplaced
pity
at
the
other
two
it
was
a
september
afternoon
and
they
were
very
gaily
dressed
and
again
caroline
had
a
feather
drooping
over
her
hair
while
sophia
more
girlish
wore
a
wide
hat
with
a
blue
bow
and
both
their
parasols
were
tilted
as
before
against
the
sun
it
seemed
to
rose
that
even
the
cut
of
their
garments
had
not
changed
with
time
the
two
had
always
the
appearance
of
fashion
plates
of
twenty
years
ago
but
no
doubt
of
their
correctness
ever
entered
their
minds
and
so
they
managed
to
preserve
their
elegance
as
though
their
belief
in
themselves
were
strong
enough
to
impose
it
on
those
who
saw
them
without
this
faith
the
severity
of
rose
black
dress
filmy
enough
for
the
season
but
daringly
plain
must
have
rebuked
them
the
pearls
in
her
ears
and
on
her
neck
were
her
only
ornaments
her
little
hat
wreathed
with
a
cream
feather
shaded
her
brow
she
sat
with
the
repose
which
was
one
of
her
gifts
sure
we
all
look
very
nice
caroline
said
suddenly
the
very
remark
she
had
made
when
they
went
to
the
haymaking
party
you
do
look
rather
like
a
widow
rose
a
widow
getting
over
it
very
comfortably
as
they
do
as
they
do
glad
i
look
so
interesting
rose
murmured
interesting
always
yes
they
were
jogging
along
the
road
bordered
by
the
high
smooth
wall
despairingly
efficient
guarding
treasures
bought
with
gold
and
the
tall
looked
over
it
as
though
they
wanted
to
escape
the
murmuring
in
their
branches
seemed
to
be
of
discontent
and
the
birds
singing
in
them
had
a
taunting
note
the
road
mounted
a
little
and
the
wall
went
with
it
backed
by
the
imprisoned
trees
but
at
last
at
the
the
wall
turned
and
the
road
went
on
without
it
there
were
open
fields
now
on
either
hand
the
property
of
francis
sales
and
another
mile
brought
the
carriage
to
the
opening
of
the
grassy
track
where
rose
liked
to
think
she
had
left
her
youth
but
the
road
went
round
on
the
other
side
of
the
larch
woods
and
when
these
were
passed
sales
hall
came
into
sight
always
think
caroline
said
a
pity
this
beautiful
avenue
has
a
better
setting
mere
fields
and
open
to
the
road
undignified
it
ought
to
have
been
a
park
a
high
wall
all
round
it
rose
suggested
caroline
agreed
she
was
touching
her
fringe
giving
little
pats
and
pulls
to
her
dress
preparatory
to
descent
and
sophia
whispered
see
caroline
that
wisp
of
hair
near
my
ear
so
tiresome
i
can
never
be
sure
of
it
a
sign
of
it
caroline
assured
her
i
wonder
what
we
are
going
to
find
they
found
the
empty
and
untouched
on
the
pale
walls
the
were
still
hanging
the
floral
carpet
still
covered
the
floor
the
faded
chintzes
had
not
been
removed
and
the
light
came
clearly
through
the
long
windows
with
their
pale
primrose
curtains
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
the
circular
settee
to
seat
four
persons
back
to
back
with
a
little
woolwork
stool
set
for
each
pair
of
feet
there
were
no
flowers
in
the
room
and
they
were
not
needed
for
the
room
itself
was
like
some
pale
scentless
and
bloom
the
three
miss
malletts
sat
down
caroline
gay
and
aggressive
as
a
parrot
and
a
parrot
in
a
big
gilded
cage
would
not
have
been
out
of
place
sophia
fitting
naturally
into
the
gentle
scheme
of
things
rose
startlingly
modern
in
her
elegance
caroline
said
a
long
time
changing
her
dress
i
expect
and
she
sniffed
but
francis
sales
entered
in
a
pink
cotton
garment
her
fair
curling
hair
a
little
untidy
for
she
had
she
said
been
in
the
old
walled
garden
behind
the
house
there
was
in
fact
a
rose
hanging
from
her
left
hand
she
was
pretty
she
seemed
artless
and
defenceless
but
her
big
blue
eyes
had
a
wary
look
and
in
spite
of
that
look
spoiling
an
otherwise
ingenuous
countenance
rose
imagined
herself
noticeably
old
and
mature
she
thought
it
was
no
wonder
that
francis
was
attracted
but
at
the
same
time
she
despised
him
for
a
failure
in
taste
as
though
faced
with
the
choice
between
a
heppelwhite
chair
and
an
affair
of
wicker
and
cretonne
he
had
chosen
the
inferior
article
though
she
had
to
admit
that
for
a
permanent
seat
it
might
be
more
comfortable
and
certainly
more
yielding
but
as
she
watched
mrs
sales
presiding
over
the
teacups
her
scared
eyes
moving
swiftly
from
the
parlourmaid
entering
with
cakes
to
caroline
and
from
caroline
to
sophia
and
then
with
added
shyness
to
the
woman
nearest
her
own
age
rose
found
her
opinion
changing
francis
sales
was
timid
but
she
was
not
weak
the
fair
fluffiness
of
her
exterior
was
deceptive
and
while
rose
made
this
discovery
and
now
and
then
dropped
a
quiet
word
into
the
chatter
of
the
others
she
was
listening
for
francis
he
had
been
with
his
wife
in
the
garden
but
he
was
some
time
in
following
her
and
rose
knew
that
mrs
sales
was
listening
too
she
wondered
whose
ear
first
caught
the
sound
of
his
feet
on
the
matted
passage
she
felt
an
absurd
inward
tremor
and
looking
at
mrs
sales
she
saw
that
her
pretty
pink
colour
had
deepened
and
her
blue
eyes
were
bright
like
flowers
she
was
certainly
charming
in
her
simple
frock
but
her
unsuitable
shoes
with
very
high
heels
and
sparkling
buckles
hurt
rose
eye
as
much
as
the
voice
also
high
and
slightly
grating
hurt
her
ear
and
this
voice
sharpened
nervously
as
it
said
here
is
francis
coming
no
he
was
not
the
person
of
rose
dreams
and
she
felt
an
immense
relief
she
had
expected
to
be
disappointed
but
she
was
glad
to
find
the
old
francis
big
bronzed
and
handsome
smelling
of
the
open
air
and
tobacco
and
tweed
and
no
dangerous
disturbing
heroic
figure
for
an
instant
he
looked
at
rose
before
he
greeted
the
elder
ladies
and
then
as
rose
let
her
hand
touch
his
and
pleasantly
said
are
you
she
experienced
a
faint
almost
physical
shock
he
was
different
after
all
and
now
she
did
not
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
unchanged
she
need
not
have
given
him
another
thought
subtly
altered
she
was
bound
to
probe
into
the
how
and
why
he
sat
beside
her
on
the
couch
with
a
curled
head
and
his
thirteen
stone
descending
heavily
on
the
springs
sent
up
her
light
weight
with
a
perceptible
jerk
boy
mrs
sales
exclaimed
playfully
rose
laughed
like
the
old
i
was
always
in
the
air
and
you
on
the
ground
is
it
there
still
near
the
pigsties
still
there
but
this
threatened
to
become
too
exclusive
a
conversation
and
rose
tried
to
do
her
share
in
more
general
topics
caroline
talking
of
the
advantage
of
radstowe
regretting
the
greater
gaiety
of
the
past
when
sophia
and
she
were
belles
was
adding
gratuitous
advice
on
the
management
of
husbands
and
some
information
on
the
ways
of
men
mrs
sales
laughed
and
glanced
now
and
then
at
francis
but
whether
he
responded
rose
could
not
see
unless
she
turned
her
head
he
ought
certainly
to
have
been
smiling
at
so
pretty
a
person
wrinkling
his
eyes
in
the
way
he
had
and
straightening
the
mouth
which
was
sullen
in
repose
yet
she
was
almost
sure
he
was
doing
the
minimum
demanded
of
politeness
almost
sure
he
was
thinking
of
herself
and
was
conscious
of
her
nearness
just
as
she
for
the
first
time
was
physically
conscious
of
his
she
rose
saying
i
look
out
of
the
window
i
always
liked
this
view
of
the
garden
and
having
gazed
out
and
made
the
necessary
remarks
she
sat
down
separated
from
him
by
the
width
of
the
room
and
with
her
back
to
the
light
a
strategical
position
she
ought
to
have
taken
up
before
but
here
she
was
at
the
disadvantage
of
facing
him
and
a
scrutiny
of
which
she
had
not
thought
him
capable
with
his
legs
stretched
out
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
eyes
apparently
half
shut
but
unquestionably
fixed
on
her
he
was
really
behaving
rather
badly
she
had
never
been
stared
at
like
this
before
and
she
told
herself
that
under
the
shelter
of
his
marriage
he
had
grown
daring
if
not
insolent
but
at
the
same
time
she
knew
she
was
not
telling
herself
the
truth
he
was
simply
in
the
position
of
a
thirsty
man
who
has
at
last
found
a
stream
it
appeared
then
that
his
wife
did
not
sufficiently
quench
his
thirst
rose
carefully
did
not
look
his
way
but
she
experienced
an
altogether
new
excitement
the
very
ancient
one
of
desiring
to
taste
forbidden
fruit
simply
because
it
was
forbidden
this
particular
fruit
as
such
had
no
special
charm
but
she
was
born
a
mallett
and
the
of
reginald
she
had
however
as
he
had
not
a
substantial
basis
of
personal
pride
and
a
love
of
beauty
which
was
at
least
as
effectual
as
a
moral
principle
and
she
had
not
francis
excuse
for
his
behaviour
she
believed
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
but
she
was
entirely
as
to
herself
and
she
refused
to
encourage
the
silent
intercourse
which
had
established
itself
between
them
caroline
was
in
the
midst
of
a
piece
of
gossip
sophia
was
interjecting
exclamations
of
moderation
and
reproach
and
mrs
sales
was
manifestly
amused
her
chromatic
giggle
was
as
punctual
as
sophia
reproof
and
rose
drew
closer
to
the
group
made
by
the
three
and
said
missing
caroline
story
which
one
is
it
and
now
it
was
francis
who
laughed
finished
caroline
said
tell
your
husband
at
least
till
we
have
gone
and
we
ought
to
go
at
once
but
the
coachman
was
not
on
the
box
he
had
been
invited
to
take
tea
in
the
kitchen
wo
disturb
him
sophia
said
caroline
let
him
have
his
tea
we
ought
to
encourage
teetotal
drinking
in
his
class
perhaps
mrs
sales
will
let
us
go
round
the
garden
i
am
so
fond
of
flowers
and
look
at
the
pigsties
francis
said
to
rose
but
assuring
him
she
had
grown
too
old
for
pigs
she
followed
the
rest
the
walled
garden
had
a
beautiful
disorder
a
grey
kitten
and
a
white
puppy
sat
together
on
the
grass
enjoying
the
sunshine
and
each
other
company
and
pretending
to
be
asleep
and
though
the
kitten
displayed
no
interest
in
the
visitors
holding
its
personality
of
more
importance
than
anything
else
the
puppy
jumped
up
barked
and
rushed
at
each
person
in
turn
caroline
picking
up
her
skirts
and
showing
the
famous
mallett
ankle
said
away
dog
in
a
severe
tone
and
the
puppy
rolled
on
the
grass
to
show
that
he
did
not
care
and
could
not
by
any
possibility
be
snubbed
under
an
on
which
the
fruit
was
ripening
were
two
cane
chairs
a
table
a
newspaper
and
a
is
my
favourite
place
mrs
sales
said
to
rose
hate
that
and
francis
wo
have
it
touched
but
i
got
a
boudoir
that
lovely
he
sent
an
order
to
the
best
shop
and
had
it
ready
for
a
surprise
so
if
i
not
out
of
doors
i
sit
there
would
you
like
to
see
it
should
very
much
rose
said
come
quickly
while
the
others
are
eating
those
plums
off
the
wall
rose
looked
back
ca
think
what
sophia
will
do
with
the
stone
she
murmured
smiling
her
faint
smile
mrs
sales
was
puzzled
by
this
remark
she
manage
wo
she
you
do
want
to
help
her
do
you
i
do
want
to
help
her
along
then
rose
saw
the
boudoir
a
little
room
up
the
stairs
louis
something
said
mrs
sales
all
the
same
i
think
sweet
and
pink
my
favourite
colour
francis
thought
of
that
i
was
wearing
pink
when
i
first
met
him
see
rose
said
that
long
ago
three
months
i
think
we
both
fell
in
love
at
the
same
minute
and
that
nice
is
it
i
know
i
going
to
be
happy
but
i
do
hope
i
sha
be
dull
we
a
big
family
at
home
i
english
she
added
a
little
anxiously
my
father
settled
there
do
think
you
should
be
dull
rose
said
in
radstowe
will
call
on
you
and
there
are
lots
of
parties
and
then
hunting
said
mrs
sales
her
eyes
left
rose
face
to
return
a
little
wider
a
little
warier
you
hunt
too
often
as
i
can
i
only
have
one
horse
says
i
am
to
have
two
they
will
be
good
ones
he
likes
hunting
and
horses
better
than
anything
else
i
suppose
he
must
neglect
the
farm
his
wife
said
firmly
and
she
added
slowly
do
know
that
i
need
two
horses
really
i
have
ridden
much
and
there
a
lot
to
do
in
the
house
i
do
believe
in
people
being
out
all
day
you
ca
hunt
all
the
year
round
you
know
mrs
sales
let
out
a
sigh
so
faint
that
most
people
would
have
missed
it
will
be
beginning
soon
wo
it
feels
a
long
way
off
in
weather
like
this
rose
said
they
are
getting
into
the
carriage
i
must
go
mrs
sales
lingered
for
an
instant
do
hope
we
going
to
be
friends
this
was
more
than
a
statement
it
was
a
request
and
rose
shrank
from
it
but
she
said
lightly
shall
be
meeting
often
you
will
see
more
of
us
than
you
will
care
for
i
afraid
the
malletts
are
rather
ubiquitous
in
radstowe
it
fortunate
for
us
or
caroline
would
die
of
boredom
but
i
do
know
how
it
appears
to
other
people
she
was
going
down
the
shallow
stairs
and
the
voice
of
mrs
sales
followed
her
sadly
has
told
me
anything
about
any
of
his
friends
three
months
he
has
had
time
with
you
to
think
about
a
laugh
pleased
and
reached
her
ears
but
rather
lonely
in
this
old
house
we
a
big
family
at
home
and
so
lively
there
was
always
something
going
on
i
wished
we
lived
nearer
radstowe
i
envy
you
here
it
peaceful
it
that
mrs
sales
agreed
a
good
deal
older
than
you
you
see
rose
elaborated
just
it
said
mrs
sales
rose
laughed
and
francis
standing
at
the
door
turned
at
the
sound
in
time
to
catch
the
end
of
rose
smile
are
you
laughing
at
sales
candour
was
i
rude
i
liked
it
yet
as
she
settled
herself
in
her
place
she
was
not
more
than
half
pleased
she
liked
her
superior
age
only
because
it
marked
a
difference
between
her
and
the
wife
of
francis
sales
caroline
said
when
the
carriage
had
turned
into
the
road
and
the
figures
in
the
doorway
had
disappeared
but
unformed
seem
very
happy
sophia
said
i
do
think
she
ought
to
have
been
wearing
black
her
has
only
been
dead
six
months
and
even
francis
was
not
wearing
a
black
tie
but
if
caroline
condemned
men
in
general
she
supported
them
in
particular
right
too
men
do
think
of
these
things
and
a
black
tie
with
those
tweeds
sophia
do
be
silly
and
sentimental
but
you
always
were
you
always
will
be
might
have
had
a
white
frock
with
a
black
ribbon
sophia
persisted
rose
looked
more
like
our
old
friend
hardly
like
a
bride
rose
said
you
see
pink
is
her
colour
it
is
dear
one
could
see
that
pink
and
blue
just
as
they
were
mine
she
corrected
herself
mine
our
complexions
are
very
much
alike
in
fact
she
reminded
me
a
little
of
myself
sophia
if
you
had
been
like
that
i
should
have
disowned
you
however
she
will
do
well
enough
for
sales
hall
rose
bent
forward
slightly
like
her
she
said
distinctly
she
lonely
my
dear
she
soon
have
half
a
dozen
children
to
keep
her
lively
caroline
the
man
will
hear
you
caroline
addressed
rose
modesty
is
indecent
i
done
what
i
could
for
her
listen
to
me
rose
said
are
not
to
belittle
mrs
sales
to
people
caroline
you
can
be
a
powerful
friend
if
you
choose
and
if
you
sing
her
praises
there
will
be
a
mighty
chorus
true
caroline
said
that
true
dear
caroline
sophia
echoed
i
think
taking
this
very
sweetly
rose
why
caroline
pricked
up
her
ears
this
i
out
of
this
oh
that
old
rubbish
she
will
have
it
you
and
francis
should
have
married
my
dear
sophia
rose
could
have
married
anybody
if
she
wanted
to
you
admit
that
yes
then
ca
you
see
she
tapped
knee
ca
you
see
that
rose
did
want
him
that
logic
and
something
you
lack
dear
sophia
said
with
the
meekness
of
the
unconvinced
of
course
it
wrong
to
think
of
it
now
that
he
married
to
another
caroline
guffawed
her
loudest
and
the
astonished
horse
quickened
his
pace
the
driver
cast
a
look
over
his
shoulder
to
see
that
all
was
well
for
he
had
a
sister
who
made
strange
noises
in
her
fits
and
sophia
sitting
in
her
drooping
fashion
as
though
her
head
with
its
great
knob
of
fair
hair
in
which
the
silver
was
just
beginning
to
show
were
too
heavy
for
her
body
had
to
listen
to
the
old
gibes
which
had
never
made
and
never
would
make
any
impression
on
her
though
she
would
have
felt
forlorn
without
them
she
was
the
only
puritanical
mallett
in
history
caroline
said
oh
yes
the
general
had
been
great
at
family
prayers
but
he
was
trying
to
make
up
for
lost
time
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
sophia
and
reginald
were
the
same
flesh
and
blood
sophia
interrupted
she
was
fond
of
reginald
but
she
had
no
desire
to
be
like
him
and
caroline
knew
he
was
a
disgrace
they
argued
for
some
time
and
rose
closed
her
eyes
until
the
talk
never
really
acrimonious
drifted
into
reminiscences
of
their
childhood
and
reginald
it
was
strange
that
they
should
have
chosen
that
day
to
speak
so
much
of
him
for
when
they
reached
home
they
found
a
letter
addressed
in
an
unfamiliar
hand
this
caroline
said
it
was
a
thin
cheap
envelope
bearing
a
london
postmark
and
caroline
drew
out
a
flimsy
sheet
of
paper
must
get
my
glasses
she
said
her
voice
was
agitated
no
i
can
manage
without
them
the
writing
is
immense
but
faint
it
from
that
woman
she
looked
up
showing
a
face
drawn
and
blotched
with
ugly
colour
to
say
that
reginald
is
dead
reginald
mallett
had
written
the
letter
on
the
day
of
her
husband
funeral
and
caroline
tears
for
her
brother
were
stemmed
by
her
indignation
with
his
wife
she
had
purposely
made
it
impossible
for
his
relatives
to
attend
the
ceremony
sophia
said
poor
thing
was
distressed
we
must
blame
her
such
a
letter
caroline
flicked
it
with
a
disdainful
finger
rose
picked
up
the
sheet
do
see
what
else
she
could
have
said
i
think
it
dignified
a
plain
statement
why
should
you
expect
more
you
have
never
taken
any
notice
of
her
not
and
reginald
never
suggested
it
of
course
he
was
ashamed
poor
boy
however
i
am
now
going
to
write
to
her
asking
if
she
is
in
need
and
enclosing
a
cheque
i
feel
some
responsibility
for
the
child
she
is
half
a
mallett
and
the
malletts
have
always
been
loyal
to
the
family
dear
we
send
a
cheque
and
should
we
a
few
kind
words
she
will
value
them
value
the
money
more
caroline
said
grimly
here
she
was
wrong
for
the
cheque
was
immediately
returned
mallett
and
her
daughter
were
able
to
support
themselves
without
help
we
need
think
no
more
about
them
caroline
said
concealing
her
annoyance
i
shall
be
able
to
afford
a
new
dinner
dress
black
sequins
i
thought
sophia
and
we
must
give
a
dinner
for
the
sales
no
you
forget
we
must
entertain
for
a
little
while
my
word
i
did
forget
but
it
no
use
pretending
it
really
is
quite
like
a
death
in
the
family
is
it
poor
dear
reginald
i
was
very
fond
of
him
but
half
our
friends
believe
he
has
been
dead
for
years
i
shall
wear
black
for
three
months
of
course
but
a
little
dinner
to
the
sales
would
not
be
out
of
place
we
have
a
duty
to
the
living
as
well
as
to
the
dead
leaving
her
stepsisters
to
argue
this
point
rose
went
upstairs
and
looked
into
reginald
old
room
she
had
known
very
little
of
him
but
she
was
sorry
he
was
dead
sorry
there
was
no
longer
a
chance
of
his
presence
in
the
house
of
meeting
him
on
the
stairs
very
late
for
breakfast
and
quite
oblivious
of
the
inconvenience
he
was
causing
and
on
his
lips
some
remark
which
no
one
else
would
have
made
his
room
had
not
been
occupied
for
some
time
but
it
seemed
emptier
than
before
the
mirror
gave
back
a
reflection
of
polished
furniture
and
vacancy
the
bed
looked
smooth
and
cold
enough
for
a
corpse
no
personal
possessions
were
strewn
about
and
the
room
itself
felt
chilly
she
was
glad
to
enter
her
own
where
beauty
and
luxury
lived
together
the
carpet
was
soft
to
her
feet
a
small
wood
fire
burned
in
the
grate
for
the
evening
promised
to
be
cold
and
the
severe
lines
of
the
furniture
were
clean
and
exquisite
against
the
white
walls
a
pale
soft
hung
across
a
chair
a
little
handkerchief
as
fine
as
lace
lay
crumpled
on
a
table
there
was
a
discreet
gleam
of
silver
and
tortoiseshell
this
at
least
was
the
room
of
a
living
person
yet
as
she
stood
before
the
studying
herself
after
the
habit
of
the
malletts
she
thought
perhaps
she
was
less
truly
living
than
reginald
in
his
grave
he
left
a
memory
of
animation
of
sin
of
charm
he
had
injured
other
people
all
his
life
but
they
regretted
him
and
presumably
he
had
had
his
pleasure
out
of
their
pain
and
what
was
she
standing
there
a
negatively
virtuous
young
woman
without
enough
desire
of
any
kind
to
impel
her
to
trample
over
feelings
creeds
and
codes
if
she
died
that
moment
it
would
be
said
of
her
that
she
was
beautiful
and
that
was
all
reginald
with
his
greed
his
heartlessness
his
indifference
to
all
that
did
not
serve
him
would
not
be
forgotten
people
would
sigh
and
smile
at
the
mention
of
his
name
hate
him
and
wish
him
back
she
envied
him
she
wished
she
could
feel
in
swift
passionate
gusts
as
he
had
done
with
the
force
and
the
forgetfulness
of
a
passing
wind
his
life
flecked
with
disgrace
must
also
have
been
rich
with
temporary
but
memorable
beauty
the
exterior
of
her
own
was
all
beauty
of
person
and
surroundings
but
within
there
seemed
to
be
only
a
cold
waste
she
had
been
tempted
the
other
afternoon
and
she
had
resisted
with
what
seemed
to
her
a
despicable
ease
she
had
not
really
cared
and
she
felt
that
the
necessity
to
struggle
even
the
collapse
of
her
resistance
would
have
argued
better
for
her
than
her
and
for
a
moment
she
wished
she
had
married
francis
sales
she
would
at
least
have
had
some
definite
work
in
the
world
she
could
have
kept
him
to
his
farming
as
mrs
sales
had
set
herself
to
do
she
would
have
had
a
home
to
see
to
and
daily
interviews
with
the
cook
she
laughed
at
this
decline
in
her
ambition
she
no
longer
expected
the
advent
of
the
colossal
figure
of
her
young
dreams
and
she
knew
this
was
the
hour
when
she
ought
to
strike
out
a
new
way
for
herself
to
leave
this
place
which
offered
her
nothing
but
ease
and
a
continuous
foredoomed
effort
after
enjoyment
but
she
also
knew
that
she
would
not
go
she
had
not
the
energy
nor
the
desire
she
would
drift
on
never
submerged
by
any
passion
keeping
her
head
calmly
above
water
looking
coldly
at
the
interminable
sea
this
was
her
conviction
but
she
was
not
without
a
secret
hope
that
she
might
at
last
be
carried
to
some
unknown
island
odorous
surprising
and
her
own
where
she
would
for
the
first
time
experience
some
kind
of
excess
the
little
dinner
was
duly
given
to
the
sales
the
sales
returned
the
compliment
and
batty
not
to
be
outdone
offered
what
could
only
adequately
be
described
as
a
banquet
in
honour
of
the
bride
there
was
a
general
revival
of
hospitality
and
the
malletts
were
at
every
function
this
was
caroline
reward
for
her
instructed
enthusiasm
for
christabel
sales
and
before
long
the
black
sequin
dress
gave
way
to
a
grey
brocade
and
a
purple
satin
and
the
period
of
mourning
was
at
an
end
for
rose
these
entertainments
were
only
interesting
because
the
sales
were
there
and
she
hardly
knew
at
what
moment
annoyance
began
to
mingle
definitely
with
her
pity
for
the
little
lady
with
the
wary
eyes
or
when
the
annoyance
almost
overcame
the
pity
it
might
have
been
at
a
when
christabel
seated
at
the
right
hand
of
a
particularly
facetious
host
let
out
her
high
chromatic
laughter
incessantly
and
the
hostess
leaning
towards
francis
told
him
with
the
tenderness
of
an
elderly
woman
whose
own
romance
lies
far
behind
her
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
mrs
sales
so
happy
he
murmured
something
in
response
and
as
he
looked
up
and
met
the
gaze
of
rose
she
smiled
at
him
and
saw
his
eyes
darken
with
feeling
or
with
thought
after
dinner
he
sought
her
out
she
had
known
that
would
happen
she
had
been
avoiding
it
for
weeks
but
it
was
useless
to
play
at
with
the
inevitable
and
she
calmly
watched
him
approach
did
you
laugh
he
asked
at
once
in
his
old
angry
fashion
were
laughing
at
me
i
smiled
you
not
so
free
with
your
smiles
that
they
have
no
meaning
not
but
i
do
know
what
the
meaning
was
believe
you
been
laughing
at
me
ever
since
i
came
back
i
have
why
should
i
knows
he
answered
with
a
shrug
never
do
understand
what
people
laugh
at
too
francis
with
you
he
said
is
going
to
sing
she
warned
him
as
a
gaunt
girl
went
towards
the
piano
and
sinking
on
to
a
convenient
and
sheltered
couch
they
resigned
themselves
to
listen
or
to
endure
from
that
corner
rose
had
a
view
of
the
long
room
mediocre
in
its
decoration
mediocre
in
its
occupants
she
could
see
her
host
standing
before
the
fire
swinging
his
eyeglasses
on
a
cord
and
gazing
at
the
cornice
as
the
song
proceeded
she
could
see
christabel
neck
and
shoulders
and
the
back
of
her
fair
head
beside
her
a
plump
matron
had
her
face
suitably
composed
three
bored
young
men
were
leaning
against
a
wall
the
music
jangled
the
voice
shrieked
a
false
emotion
and
eyebrows
rose
with
the
voice
it
was
dull
it
was
dreary
it
was
a
waste
of
time
yet
what
else
rose
questioned
could
she
do
with
time
of
which
there
was
so
much
she
could
not
find
an
answer
and
there
rose
at
that
moment
a
chorus
of
thanks
and
a
gentle
clapping
of
hands
the
gaunt
girl
had
finished
her
song
and
poking
her
chin
returned
to
her
seat
the
room
buzzed
with
chatter
it
seemed
that
only
francis
and
rose
were
silent
she
turned
to
look
at
him
is
awful
he
said
worse
than
usual
do
you
think
we
shall
have
exhausted
radstowe
hospitality
and
the
worst
of
it
is
we
have
to
give
dinners
ourselves
and
the
same
things
happen
every
time
find
it
soporific
said
rose
rather
be
soporific
in
an
with
a
pipe
is
one
of
the
penalties
of
marriage
rose
said
lightly
here
i
giving
christabel
another
jumping
lesson
i
put
some
hurdles
up
will
you
come
she
getting
on
very
well
i
take
her
hunting
before
long
she
like
it
rather
my
word
it
would
have
been
a
catastrophe
if
she
taken
to
it
he
paused
considering
the
terrible
situation
from
which
he
had
been
saved
imagine
what
i
should
have
done
but
never
satisfied
she
beginning
to
jeer
at
the
old
brown
horse
seen
a
grey
mare
that
might
do
for
her
and
he
went
on
to
enumerate
the
animal
points
rose
said
do
you
let
her
have
her
first
season
with
the
old
horse
he
knows
his
business
he
take
care
of
her
would
approve
of
that
i
tell
you
she
ambitious
i
go
and
fetch
her
and
you
hear
for
yourself
she
watched
him
bending
over
his
wife
and
saw
christabel
rise
and
slip
a
hand
under
his
arm
the
action
was
a
little
like
that
of
a
young
woman
taking
a
walk
with
her
young
man
but
it
betokened
a
confidence
which
roused
a
slight
feeling
of
envy
and
sadness
in
heart
have
been
talking
about
hunting
she
began
at
once
yes
christabel
said
she
looked
warily
from
one
to
the
other
recommending
you
to
stick
to
the
old
brown
horse
but
francis
says
you
laugh
at
him
you
ride
him
yourself
christabel
asked
if
i
could
get
something
better
then
christabel
tone
was
final
but
rose
persisted
saying
you
see
this
is
my
first
season
stick
to
the
old
horse
for
a
little
while
christabel
said
firmly
francis
thinks
i
can
ride
the
mare
i
should
like
to
have
her
rose
laughed
but
she
felt
uneasy
and
francis
said
told
you
so
she
has
any
amount
of
pluck
you
come
and
watch
i
ca
come
i
think
i
see
her
first
in
all
her
glory
on
the
grey
mare
the
same
christabel
added
she
very
expensive
i
want
her
francis
is
extravagant
over
horses
and
we
have
to
be
careful
economize
somewhere
else
he
said
mare
is
yours
she
suppressed
a
sigh
rose
was
sure
of
it
and
in
after
days
she
was
to
ask
herself
many
times
if
she
had
been
to
blame
in
not
interpreting
that
sigh
to
francis
but
she
had
to
give
christabel
and
christabel
especially
the
loyalty
of
one
woman
to
another
she
would
not
wrench
from
her
in
a
few
words
the
pride
francis
took
in
her
to
which
she
sacrificed
her
fears
rose
had
the
astuteness
of
a
jealousy
she
would
not
own
of
a
sense
of
possession
she
could
not
discard
and
she
had
known
from
the
first
moment
that
christabel
was
afraid
of
horses
and
dreaded
the
very
name
of
hunting
and
rose
divined
too
that
if
she
herself
had
not
been
a
horsewoman
of
some
repute
christabel
would
have
been
less
ambitious
she
would
have
been
contented
with
the
old
brown
horse
but
christabel
too
had
an
astuteness
no
she
could
not
have
interfered
yet
when
she
first
saw
christabel
on
the
mare
she
was
alarmed
to
the
point
of
saying
you
sure
she
all
right
you
better
keep
beside
her
francis
the
mare
was
fidgety
and
christabel
hands
were
unsteady
her
face
was
pale
her
lips
were
tight
but
she
was
gay
and
francis
was
proud
to
have
her
and
her
mount
admired
rose
looked
round
in
despair
could
no
one
else
see
what
was
so
plain
to
her
she
was
tempted
to
go
home
she
felt
she
could
not
bear
the
strain
of
watching
that
little
figure
perched
on
the
grey
beast
that
looked
like
a
wraith
like
a
warning
but
she
did
not
go
and
she
learnt
to
be
glad
to
have
shared
with
francis
the
horror
of
the
moment
when
the
mare
out
of
control
and
mad
with
excitement
tried
a
fence
topping
a
bank
failed
and
fell
with
christabel
beneath
her
on
the
ground
there
was
a
flurry
of
white
and
black
and
then
stillness
while
over
the
fields
the
hounds
and
the
foremost
riders
went
like
things
seen
in
a
dream
with
the
same
callousness
the
same
speed
rose
saw
men
dismount
and
run
towards
the
queer
ugly
muddle
on
the
grass
she
dismounted
too
and
gave
her
horse
to
somebody
to
hold
but
she
did
nothing
other
more
capable
people
were
before
her
and
it
struck
her
at
that
moment
while
a
bird
in
a
bare
hedge
set
up
a
short
chirrup
of
surprise
how
little
used
she
was
to
action
she
seemed
to
be
standing
alone
in
the
big
field
the
rest
was
a
picture
with
which
she
had
nothing
to
do
there
was
a
busy
group
near
the
fence
some
men
came
running
with
a
door
and
then
the
sound
of
a
shot
broke
through
her
numbness
the
mare
had
been
put
out
of
her
pain
but
what
of
christabel
she
hurried
forward
she
heard
some
one
say
here
miss
mallett
and
she
answered
vaguely
are
gentler
but
as
they
lifted
christabel
rose
held
one
of
her
hands
it
felt
lifeless
she
looked
small
and
broken
she
made
no
sound
not
conscious
a
man
said
and
at
that
she
opened
her
eyes
god
she
got
some
pluck
francis
said
god
she
smiled
at
him
and
he
dropped
behind
with
a
gesture
of
despair
were
right
he
said
to
rose
was
equal
to
that
brute
he
turned
angrily
did
you
make
me
see
she
made
no
answer
then
or
afterwards
to
him
but
over
and
over
again
with
the
awful
reiteration
of
the
she
set
out
her
reasons
for
her
silence
she
might
have
told
him
that
of
these
he
was
the
chief
if
he
had
looked
at
her
less
persistently
on
her
visits
to
sales
hall
if
he
had
married
another
kind
of
woman
she
would
not
have
been
afraid
to
speak
but
she
had
tried
not
to
extinguish
what
little
flame
of
love
still
flickered
in
his
heart
for
christabel
and
she
had
succeeded
in
almost
extinguishing
her
life
in
reducing
her
to
permanent
helplessness
this
was
rose
first
experience
of
how
evil
comes
out
of
good
what
would
happen
to
that
love
rose
did
not
know
for
a
time
it
burned
more
brightly
fanned
by
christabel
heroism
and
francis
remorse
but
heroism
can
become
monotonous
to
the
spectator
and
poignant
remorse
can
not
be
endured
for
ever
christabel
plight
was
pitiful
but
rose
was
sorrier
for
francis
he
had
as
it
were
engaged
her
compassion
years
ago
he
had
a
prior
claim
and
as
time
went
on
her
pity
for
christabel
changed
at
moments
to
annoyance
it
was
cruel
but
rose
had
no
fund
of
patience
she
disliked
illness
as
she
did
deformity
and
though
christabel
never
complained
of
her
constant
pain
she
developed
the
exactions
of
an
invalid
and
the
suspicions
in
those
blue
eyes
bluer
and
more
than
ever
wary
rose
saw
the
questions
which
were
never
asked
in
the
bedroom
which
with
the
boudoir
had
been
furnished
and
decorated
by
the
best
shop
in
radstowe
for
a
surprise
christabel
lay
on
a
couch
near
the
window
with
a
nurse
in
attendance
the
puppy
and
the
kitten
both
growing
staid
for
company
it
tired
her
to
use
her
hands
she
had
never
cared
for
reading
and
she
lay
there
with
little
for
consolation
but
her
pride
in
stoically
bearing
pain
often
and
with
many
interruptions
she
made
rose
repeat
the
details
of
the
accident
was
riding
well
was
i
she
would
ask
was
pleased
with
me
he
said
so
it
was
my
fault
was
it
and
then
when
they
were
carrying
me
home
did
you
hear
what
he
said
tell
me
what
he
said
and
rose
told
her
said
my
god
she
has
got
pluck
oh
christabel
do
talk
about
it
like
to
she
replied
but
the
day
came
when
she
insisted
on
this
subject
for
the
last
time
me
what
you
thought
when
you
saw
me
on
the
mare
she
said
and
rose
careless
for
once
answered
immediately
thought
she
fit
for
you
to
ride
christabel
said
slowly
you
did
you
but
you
did
say
anything
that
was
queer
rose
said
nothing
she
was
frozen
dumb
and
there
was
no
possible
reply
to
such
an
implication
but
she
rose
and
drew
on
her
gloves
she
looked
tall
and
straight
in
her
habit
and
formidable
you
going
but
you
must
have
tea
with
francis
he
expecting
you
wo
stay
rose
said
she
was
shaking
with
the
anger
she
suppressed
if
you
do
christabel
cried
want
to
know
why
ask
me
ca
help
that
rose
said
tears
came
into
christabel
eyes
might
at
least
do
that
for
me
well
because
you
ask
me
you
come
again
soon
the
sternness
of
rose
face
was
broken
by
an
ironic
smile
course
if
you
are
sure
you
want
me
she
went
downstairs
and
as
usual
francis
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
matted
hall
he
did
not
greet
her
with
a
word
or
a
smile
he
watched
her
descend
the
shallow
flight
and
together
they
went
down
the
passage
to
the
clear
where
the
faded
looked
unreal
and
innocent
and
ignorant
of
tragedy
the
matter
he
asked
she
looked
into
the
oval
mirror
which
had
so
often
reflected
his
mother
placid
face
hat
a
little
crooked
she
said
he
laughed
without
mirth
in
its
life
has
christabel
been
worrying
you
me
poor
child
it
damnable
but
she
does
worry
one
and
you
look
odd
getting
old
she
murmured
not
seeking
reassurance
but
stating
a
fact
plain
to
her
exactly
the
same
he
said
the
same
he
swept
his
face
with
his
hands
and
at
that
sight
a
new
sensation
seized
her
delicately
delightfully
as
though
a
firm
hand
held
her
for
an
instant
above
the
earth
high
in
the
air
free
from
care
from
restrictions
from
the
necessity
for
thought
but
only
for
an
instant
she
was
set
down
again
inwardly
swaying
apparently
unmoved
but
conscious
of
the
carpet
under
her
feet
the
chairs
with
twisted
legs
the
primrose
curtains
the
spring
afternoon
outside
us
have
tea
she
said
she
handled
the
pretty
flowered
cups
and
under
her
astonished
eyes
the
painted
flowers
were
like
a
little
garden
gay
and
sweet
and
gilded
she
seemed
to
smell
them
and
the
hiss
of
the
kettle
was
like
a
song
then
as
she
handed
him
his
cup
and
looked
into
his
wretched
face
and
remembered
the
bitter
reality
of
things
she
still
could
not
lose
all
sense
of
sweetness
say
any
more
she
said
quickly
say
another
word
wo
if
you
sure
you
know
everything
do
you
single
thing
you
care
she
drew
a
breath
care
beyond
speaking
of
it
francis
not
a
word
it
was
extraordinary
it
was
inexplicable
but
it
was
true
and
happily
beyond
the
region
of
regrets
for
if
she
had
married
him
years
ago
she
would
never
have
loved
him
in
this
miraculous
sudden
way
with
this
passion
of
tenderness
this
desire
to
make
him
happy
this
terrible
conviction
that
she
could
not
do
it
this
promise
of
suffering
for
herself
and
the
wonder
of
it
was
that
he
had
no
likeness
to
that
absurd
francis
of
whom
she
had
dreamed
and
whom
she
had
not
loved
no
likeness
either
to
the
colossal
tyrant
the
man
she
loved
was
in
some
ways
weak
he
was
petulant
he
was
a
baby
but
he
needed
her
and
for
a
romantic
and
sentimental
moment
she
saw
herself
as
his
refuge
his
strength
she
could
not
must
not
communicate
those
thoughts
she
began
to
talk
happily
and
serenely
about
ordinary
things
until
she
remembered
that
she
had
lingered
past
her
usual
hour
and
that
upstairs
christabel
must
be
listening
for
the
sound
of
her
horse
hoofs
she
started
up
you
fetch
peter
for
me
you
will
tell
me
when
you
are
coming
again
day
next
week
he
kissed
her
hand
and
held
it
do
you
must
spoil
things
have
said
a
word
is
good
she
said
and
she
knew
she
could
be
silent
for
ever
restraint
and
a
love
of
danger
lived
together
in
her
nature
and
these
two
qualities
were
fed
by
the
position
in
which
she
found
herself
nor
would
she
have
had
the
position
changed
it
supplied
her
with
the
emotion
she
had
wanted
she
had
the
privilege
of
feeling
deeply
and
dangerously
and
yet
of
preserving
her
pride
there
was
irony
in
the
fact
that
christabel
hinting
at
suspicions
for
which
in
rose
mind
there
was
at
first
no
cause
had
at
last
actually
brought
about
what
she
feared
and
if
rose
had
looked
for
justification
she
might
have
found
it
there
but
she
did
not
look
for
it
any
more
than
reginald
would
have
done
she
was
like
him
there
but
where
she
differed
was
in
loyalty
to
an
idea
she
saw
love
as
something
noble
and
inspiring
worthy
of
sacrifice
and
more
concretely
she
was
determined
not
to
increase
the
disaster
which
had
befallen
christabel
sooner
or
later
in
normal
conditions
her
marriage
must
have
been
recognized
as
a
failure
but
in
these
abnormal
ones
it
had
to
be
sustained
as
a
success
and
it
seemed
to
rose
that
civilized
beings
could
love
and
live
in
the
knowledge
of
their
love
without
injuring
some
one
already
cruelly
unfortunate
but
as
the
months
went
by
she
found
she
had
to
reckon
with
two
difficult
people
or
rather
with
two
people
ordinary
in
themselves
cast
by
fate
into
a
difficult
situation
there
was
christabel
with
her
countless
idle
hours
in
which
to
formulate
theories
to
lay
traps
to
realize
that
the
devotion
of
francis
became
less
obvious
and
there
was
francis
breaking
the
spirit
of
their
contract
with
his
looks
and
sometimes
the
letter
with
his
complaints
and
pleadings
he
could
not
go
on
like
this
for
ever
he
said
he
saw
her
once
a
week
for
a
few
minutes
if
he
was
lucky
how
could
she
expect
him
to
be
satisfied
with
that
it
was
little
enough
she
owned
but
more
than
it
might
have
been
she
could
never
make
him
admit
perhaps
because
he
did
not
feel
how
greatly
they
were
blessed
but
she
saw
herself
as
the
guardian
of
a
temple
she
stood
in
the
doorway
forbidding
him
to
enter
less
the
place
should
be
defiled
yet
forbidding
him
in
such
a
way
that
he
should
not
love
her
less
yet
constantly
saying
constantly
shaking
the
head
and
smiling
propitiatingly
the
while
is
not
to
appease
and
those
short
hours
of
companionship
in
which
they
had
once
managed
to
be
happy
became
times
of
strain
of
disappointment
of
barely
kept
control
wish
i
could
stop
loving
you
he
broke
out
one
day
i
ca
you
the
kind
one
does
forget
i
thought
i
done
it
once
for
a
few
months
but
you
came
back
you
came
back
she
smiled
seeming
aloof
and
full
of
some
wisdom
unknown
to
him
she
knew
he
could
not
do
without
her
still
more
she
knew
he
must
not
do
without
her
and
these
certainties
became
the
main
fabric
of
her
love
she
had
to
keep
him
less
for
her
own
sake
than
for
that
of
her
idea
but
gradually
the
severe
rules
she
had
made
became
relaxed
they
were
not
to
meet
except
on
that
one
day
a
week
demanded
by
christabel
who
also
had
to
keep
francis
happy
and
who
would
have
welcomed
the
powers
of
darkness
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
her
own
life
but
rose
could
hardly
take
a
ride
without
meeting
francis
also
riding
or
he
would
appear
on
foot
out
of
a
wood
out
of
a
side
road
and
waylay
her
he
seemed
to
have
an
uncanny
knowledge
of
her
presence
and
they
would
have
a
few
minutes
of
conversation
or
of
a
silence
which
was
no
longer
beautiful
but
terrible
with
effort
with
possibilities
and
with
dread
she
ought
she
knew
to
have
kept
to
her
own
side
of
the
bridge
to
have
ridden
on
the
high
downs
inviting
to
a
rider
but
she
loved
the
farther
country
where
the
air
was
blue
and
soft
where
little
orchards
broke
oddly
into
great
fields
where
brooks
ran
across
the
lanes
and
cottages
were
fronted
by
little
gardens
full
of
homely
flowers
and
clothes
drying
on
the
bushes
there
was
a
smell
of
fruit
and
wood
fires
and
damp
earth
there
was
a
veil
of
magic
over
the
whole
landscape
and
far
off
the
shining
line
of
the
channel
seemed
to
be
washing
the
feet
of
the
blue
hills
the
country
had
the
charm
of
home
with
the
allurement
of
the
unknown
and
within
sound
of
the
steamers
hooting
in
the
river
almost
within
sight
of
the
city
lying
and
smoky
with
factories
round
the
docks
and
mounting
in
terraces
to
the
heights
of
upper
radstowe
there
was
an
expectation
of
mystery
of
secrets
kept
for
countless
centuries
by
the
earth
which
was
rich
and
fecund
and
alive
she
could
not
deny
herself
the
sight
of
this
country
it
had
become
dearer
to
her
since
her
awakened
feelings
had
brought
with
them
the
complexities
of
new
thoughts
it
soothed
her
though
it
solved
nothing
it
did
not
wish
to
solve
anything
it
lay
before
her
with
its
fields
its
woods
its
patches
of
heathy
land
its
bones
of
grey
limestone
showing
where
the
flesh
of
the
red
earth
had
fallen
away
its
dips
and
hollows
its
steep
lanes
like
the
wide
eye
of
a
being
too
full
of
understanding
to
attempt
elucidations
it
would
not
explain
it
knew
but
it
would
not
impart
the
knowledge
which
must
be
gained
through
the
experience
of
years
of
storms
of
sunshine
of
calamity
and
joy
and
sometimes
the
presence
of
francis
with
his
personal
claims
and
his
complaints
was
an
intrusion
almost
an
anachronism
he
was
of
his
own
time
and
the
end
of
that
was
almost
within
sight
while
the
earth
immensely
old
had
a
youth
of
its
own
something
which
francis
would
never
have
again
but
perhaps
because
he
was
essentially
simple
he
would
have
fitted
in
well
enough
if
he
had
been
less
ready
to
voice
his
grievances
and
ruffle
the
calm
which
she
so
carefully
preserved
which
he
called
coldness
and
for
which
he
reproached
her
often
have
no
peace
he
grumbled
would
get
it
if
you
would
accept
things
as
they
are
you
have
to
in
the
end
so
why
not
now
she
longed
to
give
peace
to
him
but
her
tenderness
was
sane
and
she
found
a
strange
pleasure
in
the
pain
of
knowing
him
to
be
irritable
and
childish
it
made
of
her
love
a
better
thing
without
the
hope
of
any
reward
but
the
continuance
of
service
easier
for
you
he
said
and
she
answered
it
in
the
way
that
angered
him
and
yet
held
him
and
she
thought
without
bitterness
that
he
had
never
suffered
anything
without
physical
or
mental
tears
you
have
peace
at
home
but
i
go
back
to
misery
her
misery
does
make
it
any
better
he
retorted
justly
know
she
touched
his
sleeve
and
feeling
his
arm
stiffen
removed
her
hand
i
feel
a
brute
because
i
ca
care
enough
if
it
were
you
now
almost
imperceptibly
rose
shook
her
head
she
had
no
illusions
but
she
said
why
not
pretend
it
me
tell
her
all
you
do
ask
her
advice
you
need
take
it
it
all
a
lie
he
growled
she
said
serenely
has
to
be
but
there
are
good
lies
she
wished
with
an
intensity
she
rarely
allowed
herself
that
he
would
be
quiet
and
controlled
though
half
her
occupation
would
be
gone
she
would
feel
for
him
a
respect
which
would
rebound
on
her
and
make
her
admirable
to
herself
but
she
knew
that
life
can
not
be
too
lavish
of
its
gifts
or
death
would
always
have
the
victory
this
was
not
what
she
had
looked
for
but
it
was
good
enough
she
was
necessary
to
him
and
always
would
be
she
was
sure
of
that
yet
she
constantly
repeated
it
moreover
she
loved
his
bigness
and
his
physical
strength
and
the
way
the
lines
round
his
eyes
wrinkled
when
he
smiled
she
knew
how
to
make
him
smile
and
now
and
then
they
had
happy
interludes
when
they
talked
about
crops
and
horses
profit
and
loss
the
buying
and
selling
of
stock
and
felt
their
friendship
for
each
other
like
a
mantle
shared
at
the
worst
she
consoled
herself
after
a
time
of
strain
it
was
like
riding
a
restive
horse
there
was
danger
which
she
loved
there
was
need
of
skill
and
a
light
hand
of
sympathy
and
tact
and
she
never
regretted
the
superman
who
was
to
have
ruled
her
with
a
fatiguing
rod
of
iron
here
there
was
give
and
take
she
had
to
let
him
have
his
head
and
pull
him
up
at
the
right
moment
and
reward
docility
with
kindness
she
even
found
a
kind
of
pleasure
streaked
with
disgust
in
dealing
with
christabel
suspicions
half
expressed
but
present
like
shadowy
people
in
her
room
of
these
she
never
spoke
to
francis
but
she
had
a
malicious
affection
for
them
they
had
as
it
were
done
her
a
good
turn
and
though
they
hid
like
secret
enemies
in
the
corners
she
recognized
them
as
allies
and
they
looked
so
much
worse
than
they
were
she
imagined
them
showing
very
ugly
faces
to
christabel
who
could
only
judge
them
by
their
looks
and
though
it
was
cruel
that
she
should
be
frightened
by
them
it
was
impossible
to
drive
them
away
rose
could
only
sit
calmly
in
their
presence
and
try
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
safety
she
knew
she
ought
to
feel
hypocritical
in
this
attendance
on
her
lover
wife
but
it
was
not
of
her
choosing
she
did
not
like
christabel
she
would
have
been
glad
never
to
see
her
again
and
terrible
as
her
situation
was
it
appealed
to
rose
less
then
it
would
have
done
if
she
had
not
herself
come
of
people
whose
tradition
was
one
of
stoicism
in
trouble
of
pride
which
refused
to
reveal
its
distress
physically
christabel
had
those
qualities
but
mentally
she
lacked
them
it
was
chiefly
to
rose
that
she
betrayed
herself
and
at
each
farewell
she
exacted
the
promise
of
another
visit
soon
was
she
fascinated
by
the
sight
of
the
woman
francis
loved
and
when
had
that
love
been
discovered
and
was
she
sure
of
it
even
now
she
certainly
had
her
sole
excitement
in
her
search
for
evidence
in
that
bedroom
gaily
decorated
for
a
bride
she
lay
heroically
bearing
pain
lacking
the
devotion
she
should
have
had
finding
her
reward
in
the
memory
of
her
husband
appreciation
of
her
courage
and
her
occupation
perhaps
her
pleasure
in
a
refinement
of
as
soon
as
rose
entered
the
room
she
was
aware
of
the
scrutiny
of
those
wary
eyes
very
wide
open
as
blue
as
flowers
and
she
knew
that
her
own
face
was
like
a
mask
the
little
dog
wagged
his
tail
the
cat
made
no
sign
the
nurse
after
a
cheerful
greeting
went
out
of
the
room
and
rose
took
her
accustomed
place
beside
the
window
it
had
a
view
of
the
garden
the
avenue
of
elms
in
which
the
rooks
cawed
continuously
the
hedge
separating
the
fields
from
the
where
carts
laden
with
farm
produce
jogged
into
radstowe
driven
by
an
old
man
or
a
stout
woman
and
returned
some
hours
later
with
the
day
shopping
kitchen
utensils
inadequately
wrapped
up
and
glistening
in
the
sunshine
a
flimsy
parcel
of
drapery
a
box
of
groceries
the
old
man
smoked
his
pipe
the
stout
woman
shook
the
reins
on
the
pony
back
the
pony
regardless
went
at
his
own
pace
heavy
farm
carts
creaked
past
whizzed
by
the
sales
hall
dairy
cows
were
driven
in
for
milking
and
then
for
a
whole
half
hour
there
might
be
nothing
on
the
road
the
country
slept
in
the
sunshine
or
patiently
endured
the
rain
for
a
member
of
a
large
and
lively
family
this
prospect
seen
from
a
permanent
couch
was
not
exhilarating
but
christabel
did
not
complain
she
took
advantage
of
every
incident
and
made
the
most
of
it
but
she
never
expressed
a
desire
for
more
she
had
for
so
frail
and
shattered
a
body
an
amazing
capacity
for
endurance
as
though
she
were
upheld
by
some
spiritual
force
it
might
have
been
religion
or
love
or
the
desire
to
perpetuate
francis
admiration
but
rose
believed
and
hated
herself
for
believing
that
it
was
partly
antagonism
and
a
feverish
curiosity
she
had
been
cheated
of
her
youth
and
strength
and
here
with
a
beautiful
impassive
face
was
the
woman
who
might
have
saved
her
a
woman
with
a
body
strongly
slim
in
her
dark
habit
and
firm
white
hands
skilled
in
managing
a
horse
she
had
read
the
grey
mare
mind
and
now
christabel
delicately
blue
and
pink
and
white
in
a
wrapper
of
silk
and
lace
her
hands
fidgeting
each
other
as
they
had
fidgeted
the
mare
mouth
thought
she
was
reading
the
mind
of
rose
she
stared
at
her
fascinated
but
not
afraid
there
were
things
she
must
find
out
she
asked
one
day
and
it
was
nearly
two
years
since
the
accident
they
kill
the
mare
and
rose
aware
that
christabel
had
known
all
the
time
answered
at
once
her
leg
was
broken
a
pity
waiting
for
what
would
come
next
rose
smiled
and
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
swaying
elm
tops
a
useful
animal
christabel
said
dangerous
rose
remarked
slipping
deliberately
into
the
trap
what
i
mean
but
not
quite
dangerous
enough
poor
francis
he
did
know
he
does
know
now
does
he
but
of
course
not
rose
had
a
great
horror
of
a
debt
and
she
owed
something
to
christabel
but
now
she
felt
she
had
paid
it
off
with
interest
she
breathed
deeply
without
a
sound
her
tone
was
light
knows
all
that
is
good
for
him
mean
that
is
good
for
you
rose
stood
up
pulled
on
her
washleather
gloves
sat
down
again
the
hands
on
the
silk
coverlet
were
shaking
are
making
yourself
ill
rose
said
she
was
tempted
to
take
those
poor
fluttering
hands
into
her
own
and
steady
them
but
her
flesh
shrank
from
the
contact
she
was
tempted
too
to
tell
christabel
the
truth
but
pride
forbade
her
and
in
a
moment
the
impulse
was
gone
and
with
its
departure
came
the
belief
that
the
truth
would
be
annihilating
it
would
rob
her
of
her
glorious
uncertainty
she
would
be
destroyed
by
the
knowledge
that
rose
had
seen
her
fear
seen
and
tried
to
strengthen
the
slender
hold
she
had
on
her
husband
love
it
was
better
to
play
the
part
of
the
wicked
woman
the
murderess
the
stealer
of
hearts
and
perhaps
she
was
wicked
she
had
not
thought
of
that
before
the
malletts
did
not
criticize
their
actions
or
analyse
their
minds
and
she
had
no
intention
of
breaking
their
habits
she
stood
up
again
and
said
i
call
the
nurse
not
going
yet
you
only
been
here
a
few
minutes
enough
rose
said
cheerfully
tears
came
into
christabel
eyes
francis
is
out
if
he
see
you
he
be
angry
he
ask
me
why
can
tell
him
the
tone
changed
you
see
him
on
your
way
home
and
then
i
can
tell
him
instead
the
tears
overflowed
she
was
helplessly
angry
she
sobbed
quiet
rose
said
sternly
shall
tell
him
nothing
you
know
that
you
are
quite
safe
whatever
you
choose
to
say
to
me
perfectly
safe
know
i
ca
help
it
i
lie
here
and
think
what
would
you
do
in
my
place
same
thing
i
suppose
rose
said
you
wo
go
i
going
you
can
tell
francis
i
was
obliged
to
get
home
early
you
come
again
yes
i
come
again
do
want
to
i
do
want
to
you
always
riding
over
here
are
you
every
day
then
the
words
lingered
meaningly
until
rose
reached
the
door
and
then
christabel
said
wish
you
ask
your
sisters
to
come
and
see
me
they
would
tell
me
all
the
news
rose
went
downstairs
laughing
at
christabel
capacity
for
mingling
tragedy
with
the
commonplace
and
sordid
accusations
with
social
desires
but
though
she
laughed
she
was
strangely
tired
and
stretching
before
her
she
saw
more
weariness
more
struggling
more
effort
without
result
she
stood
in
the
masculine
matted
hall
with
the
usual
worn
pair
of
slippers
in
the
corner
a
stick
lying
across
a
chair
a
collection
of
coats
and
hats
on
the
pegs
and
she
felt
she
would
be
glad
if
she
were
never
to
see
all
this
again
and
for
the
first
time
she
thought
seriously
of
desertion
she
wished
she
could
go
to
some
unfamiliar
country
where
the
people
would
all
have
new
faces
where
the
language
would
be
strange
the
sights
different
the
smells
unlike
those
which
were
wafted
through
the
open
door
she
wanted
a
fresh
body
and
a
new
world
but
she
knew
that
she
would
not
get
them
for
leaving
francis
would
be
like
leaving
a
child
so
she
told
herself
but
at
the
back
of
her
mind
was
the
certainty
that
if
she
went
he
would
soon
attach
himself
to
another
strength
or
weakness
yes
to
weakness
and
she
found
she
could
not
contemplate
that
event
less
because
she
clung
to
him
than
because
her
pride
could
not
tolerate
a
substitution
which
would
be
an
admission
of
her
likeness
to
other
women
yet
in
that
very
lack
of
toleration
her
pride
was
lowered
and
if
she
was
not
clinging
to
him
for
her
own
sake
she
was
holding
on
to
her
place
her
uniqueness
refusing
the
possibility
that
another
woman
could
serve
him
as
she
had
served
him
with
pain
with
suffering
she
was
like
a
queen
who
does
not
love
her
throne
supremely
but
will
not
abdicate
who
would
rather
fail
in
her
appointed
place
than
see
another
succeed
in
it
for
a
minute
rose
mallett
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
already
occupied
by
the
stick
and
she
pressed
both
hands
against
her
forehead
driving
back
her
thoughts
thinking
was
dangerous
and
a
folly
it
was
a
concession
to
circumstances
and
she
would
concede
nothing
she
stood
up
looked
round
for
a
mirror
remembered
there
was
not
one
in
the
hall
and
with
little
meticulous
touches
to
her
hat
her
hair
and
the
white
stock
round
her
neck
she
left
the
house
she
returned
to
a
occupied
by
caroline
and
sophia
yet
strangely
silent
there
was
not
a
sound
but
what
came
from
the
birds
in
the
garden
caroline
spectacles
were
on
her
nose
and
though
she
was
not
reading
the
letter
on
her
knee
she
had
forgotten
to
take
them
off
an
ominous
sign
sophia
face
was
flushed
with
agitation
her
head
drooped
more
than
usual
but
she
lifted
it
with
a
sigh
of
relief
at
rose
entrance
in
such
trouble
dear
she
said
nonsense
no
trouble
at
all
look
here
rose
that
woman
has
died
now
she
shook
the
letter
threateningly
this
wife
i
suppose
she
was
his
wife
i
dare
say
he
had
dozens
sophia
remonstrated
rose
took
the
letter
and
read
what
reginald
mallett
believing
herself
about
to
die
had
written
in
her
big
sprawling
hand
the
letter
was
only
to
be
posted
after
her
death
and
she
made
no
apology
for
asking
the
malletts
to
see
that
her
daughter
had
the
chance
of
earning
her
living
suitably
is
a
good
girl
she
wrote
when
i
am
gone
her
only
friend
will
be
the
landlady
of
this
house
and
there
are
young
men
about
the
place
who
are
not
the
right
kind
i
am
telling
my
dear
girl
that
i
wish
her
to
accept
any
offer
of
help
she
gets
from
you
and
she
will
do
what
i
ask
you
see
caroline
said
as
rose
looked
up
not
done
with
reginald
yet
and
what
i
propose
is
that
we
send
susan
for
the
girl
sophia
echoed
i
go
rose
asked
sophia
murmured
gratitude
caroline
snorted
doubt
and
rose
added
i
think
not
she
would
like
it
susan
would
be
better
but
not
you
must
write
to
the
child
what
her
name
henrietta
henrietta
after
our
grandmother
the
idea
i
do
know
how
reginald
dared
she
a
sacred
character
rose
asked
dryly
to
her
caroline
and
say
susan
will
come
on
the
day
that
suits
her
best
you
ca
drag
her
away
without
warning
let
treat
her
courteously
please
rose
dear
i
think
we
are
always
courteous
sophia
protested
caroline
merely
said
and
added
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
her
when
we
get
her
she
giggle
she
have
a
dreadful
accent
sophia
will
blush
for
her
i
sha
i
never
blush
for
anybody
even
myself
but
i
shall
be
bored
that
worse
and
if
you
think
i
going
to
edit
my
stories
for
her
benefit
sophia
mistaken
i
never
managed
to
do
that
even
for
the
general
and
too
old
to
begin
she
removed
her
spectacles
hastily
old
for
that
anyhow
rose
smiled
she
thought
that
probably
the
child
of
reginald
mallett
living
from
hand
to
mouth
in
boarding
houses
the
sharer
of
his
sinking
fortunes
the
witness
of
his
passions
and
despairs
and
infidelities
would
find
caroline
stories
innocent
enough
her
hope
was
that
henrietta
would
not
try
to
cap
them
but
the
chances
were
that
she
would
be
a
terrible
young
person
that
she
would
find
herself
adrift
in
the
respectability
of
radstowe
where
she
was
unlikely
to
meet
those
young
men
not
of
the
right
kind
to
whom
she
was
accustomed
must
have
her
father
room
sophia
said
she
was
trying
to
conceal
her
excitement
must
put
some
flowers
there
i
think
just
go
upstairs
and
see
if
there
any
little
improvement
we
could
make
they
all
went
upstairs
and
stood
in
that
room
devoted
to
the
memory
of
the
scapegrace
but
they
made
no
alterations
sophia
expressing
the
belief
that
henrietta
would
prefer
it
as
it
was
and
caroline
as
she
wiped
away
two
slow
tears
saying
that
reginald
was
a
wretch
and
she
could
not
see
why
they
should
put
themselves
to
any
trouble
for
his
daughter
book
ii
after
luncheon
henrietta
went
to
her
room
to
unpack
the
brown
tin
trunk
which
contained
all
her
possessions
and
as
she
ascended
the
stairs
with
her
hand
on
the
polished
mahogany
rail
she
heard
sophia
saying
a
true
mallett
she
has
the
mallett
ankle
did
you
notice
it
caroline
and
caroline
answered
harshly
the
mallett
ankle
but
not
the
foot
her
foot
is
square
like
a
block
of
wood
what
could
you
expect
then
the
door
was
closed
softly
on
this
indiscretion
henrietta
continued
steadily
up
the
stairs
and
across
the
landing
to
her
father
room
and
before
the
long
mirror
on
the
wall
she
halted
to
survey
her
reflected
feet
aunt
caroline
had
but
exaggerated
the
truth
they
were
square
but
they
were
small
and
she
controlled
her
trembling
lips
she
pushed
back
from
her
forehead
the
black
curling
hair
she
was
tired
the
luncheon
had
been
a
strain
and
the
carelessly
loud
words
of
caroline
reminded
her
that
she
was
undergoing
an
examination
which
veiled
by
courtesy
would
be
severe
already
they
were
blaming
her
mother
for
her
feet
and
all
three
of
them
the
blunt
caroline
the
tender
sophia
the
mysteriously
silent
rose
were
on
the
watch
for
the
maternal
traits
well
she
was
not
ashamed
of
them
her
mother
had
been
good
brave
honest
loving
patient
and
her
father
had
been
none
of
these
things
but
no
doubt
these
aunts
of
hers
put
manners
before
morals
as
he
had
done
and
she
remembered
how
when
she
was
quite
a
little
girl
and
the
witness
of
one
of
the
unpleasant
domestic
scenes
which
happened
often
in
those
days
before
reginald
mallett
wife
had
learnt
forbearance
she
had
noticed
her
father
face
twitch
as
though
in
pain
glad
of
a
diversion
she
had
asked
him
with
eager
sympathy
it
toothache
and
he
had
answered
acidly
child
only
the
mutilation
of
our
language
she
remembered
the
words
and
later
she
understood
their
meaning
and
the
flushing
of
her
mother
face
the
compression
of
her
lips
and
she
was
indignant
for
her
sake
yet
she
could
feel
for
her
father
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
whatever
her
accent
or
grammatical
mistakes
her
mother
conduct
was
always
right
and
her
father
with
his
charming
air
a
little
blurred
by
what
he
called
misfortune
his
clear
speech
to
which
henrietta
loved
to
listen
was
fundamentally
unsound
he
could
not
be
trusted
that
was
understood
between
the
mother
and
daughter
it
was
one
of
the
facts
on
which
their
existence
rested
it
entered
into
all
their
calculations
it
was
the
text
of
all
her
mother
little
homilies
henrietta
must
always
pay
her
debts
she
must
tell
the
truth
she
must
do
nothing
of
which
she
was
ashamed
and
so
far
henrietta
had
succeeded
in
obeying
these
commands
when
reginald
mallett
died
in
the
shabby
kept
by
banks
he
left
his
family
without
a
penny
but
with
a
feeling
of
extraordinary
peace
they
were
destitute
but
they
were
no
longer
overshadowed
by
the
fear
of
disgrace
the
misery
of
subterfuge
the
bewildering
oscillations
between
pity
for
the
man
who
could
not
have
what
he
wanted
and
shame
for
his
ceaseless
striving
after
pleasure
his
shifts
to
get
it
his
reproaches
and
complaints
in
the
gloomy
back
bedroom
on
the
third
story
of
the
he
lay
on
a
bed
hung
with
dingy
curtains
but
in
the
dignity
which
was
one
of
his
inheritances
under
the
dark
moustache
his
lips
seemed
to
smile
faintly
perhaps
in
amusement
at
the
folly
of
his
life
perhaps
in
surprise
at
finding
himself
so
still
the
narrow
beard
of
a
foreign
cut
was
slightly
tilted
towards
the
dirty
ceiling
his
beautiful
hands
were
folded
as
though
in
a
mockery
of
prayer
he
was
as
banks
remarked
when
she
was
allowed
to
see
him
a
lovely
corpse
but
to
henrietta
and
her
mother
standing
on
either
side
of
the
bed
guarding
him
now
as
they
had
always
tried
to
do
he
had
subtly
become
the
husband
and
father
he
should
have
been
must
remember
him
like
this
mallett
said
raising
her
soft
blue
eyes
and
henrietta
saw
that
the
small
sharp
lines
which
reginald
mallett
had
helped
to
carve
in
her
face
seemed
to
have
disappeared
it
was
extraordinary
how
placid
her
face
became
after
his
death
but
as
the
days
passed
it
was
also
noticeable
that
much
of
her
vitality
had
gone
too
she
left
herself
in
henrietta
young
hands
and
she
casting
about
for
a
way
of
earning
her
living
found
good
fortune
in
the
terrible
basement
kitchen
where
banks
moved
mournfully
and
had
her
disconsolate
being
the
gas
was
always
lighted
in
that
cavernous
kitchen
but
it
remained
dark
mercifully
leaving
the
dirt
half
unseen
a
joint
of
mutton
cold
and
mangled
was
discernible
however
when
henrietta
descended
to
put
her
impecunious
case
before
the
landlady
and
gazing
at
it
the
girl
saw
also
her
opportunity
banks
had
no
culinary
imagination
but
henrietta
found
it
rising
in
herself
to
an
inspired
degree
and
there
and
then
she
offered
herself
as
cook
in
return
for
board
and
lodging
for
her
mother
and
herself
sure
i
be
glad
to
keep
you
banks
said
give
the
place
a
tone
you
do
really
you
and
your
dear
ma
sitting
in
the
sewing
of
an
evening
but
it
is
only
the
cooking
though
i
do
get
to
hate
the
sight
of
food
i
get
a
regular
grudge
against
it
but
it
that
butcher
ready
money
or
no
meat
his
motto
and
how
to
make
this
mutton
last
she
picked
it
up
by
the
bone
and
cast
it
down
again
i
can
manage
butchers
henrietta
said
we
pay
our
way
you
see
leave
the
cooking
to
me
will
gladly
banks
said
wiping
away
a
tear
since
banks
took
it
into
his
head
to
jump
into
the
river
it
seems
like
as
if
i
had
any
spirit
and
that
jenkins
turns
up
his
ugly
nose
every
time
i
put
the
mutton
on
the
table
when
he
does
begin
talking
to
it
like
an
old
friend
i
ca
bear
jenkins
but
he
does
pay
regular
and
that
something
well
i
get
on
with
the
upstairs
and
leave
you
to
it
and
so
henrietta
began
the
work
which
kept
her
amazingly
happy
fed
and
sheltered
her
mother
who
sat
all
day
slowly
making
beautiful
baby
linen
for
one
of
the
big
shops
and
cemented
henrietta
friendship
with
the
lachrymose
banks
to
be
faced
with
a
mutton
bone
and
a
few
vegetables
to
have
to
wrest
from
these
poor
materials
an
appetizing
meal
was
like
an
exciting
game
and
she
played
it
with
zest
and
with
success
she
had
the
dubious
pleasure
of
hearing
jenkins
smack
his
lips
and
seeing
him
distend
his
nostrils
with
anticipation
the
unalloyed
one
of
watching
the
pale
face
of
little
miss
stubb
the
typist
grow
delicately
pink
and
less
dangerously
thin
under
the
stimulus
of
good
food
the
amusement
of
congratulating
banks
in
public
on
her
new
cook
and
seeing
banks
at
the
head
of
the
supper
table
nod
her
head
with
important
secrecy
made
out
she
told
henrietta
i
a
daily
girl
without
a
character
that
how
i
can
afford
her
in
the
basement
but
i
must
say
it
made
that
jenkins
mighty
keen
on
fetching
his
own
boots
of
a
morning
but
no
lodgers
is
my
rule
you
look
out
for
jenkins
my
dear
he
no
good
i
know
his
sort
i
can
manage
jenkins
too
henrietta
said
and
indeed
she
made
a
point
of
bringing
him
to
the
hardly
manageable
state
for
the
amusement
of
proving
her
capacity
she
despised
him
but
not
for
nothing
was
she
reginald
mallett
daughter
and
jenkins
and
the
butcher
and
a
gloomy
old
gentleman
who
emerged
from
his
bedroom
to
eat
and
locked
himself
up
between
meals
were
the
only
men
she
knew
no
doubt
mallett
placidly
sewing
was
alive
to
the
attentions
and
frustrations
of
jenkins
and
had
planned
her
letter
to
her
some
time
before
she
wrote
it
but
the
idea
of
parting
from
her
mother
never
occurred
to
henrietta
until
miss
stubb
alarmed
her
mother
she
said
poetically
me
think
of
snow
melting
before
the
sun
in
fact
i
ca
look
at
her
without
thinking
of
snow
and
snowdrops
and
and
graves
last
spring
i
said
to
banks
she
wo
see
the
leaves
fall
i
said
and
banks
agreed
she
has
been
spared
but
take
care
of
her
in
these
cold
winds
miss
henrietta
dear
has
a
cold
only
a
cold
henrietta
said
in
a
dead
voice
and
she
went
upstairs
her
mother
was
in
bed
and
henrietta
looked
down
at
the
thin
pretty
face
ill
are
you
she
asked
in
a
threatening
manner
me
how
ill
you
are
only
got
a
cold
henry
dear
i
shall
be
up
you
wo
be
really
should
i
be
miss
stubb
saying
things
chatter
mallett
said
it
not
scandal
it
an
illness
you
ought
to
know
that
might
leave
you
alone
anyway
i
wish
they
would
mallett
said
faintly
and
dropped
back
on
her
pillow
now
sitting
in
her
father
room
with
her
mother
only
a
few
weeks
dead
she
reproached
herself
for
her
readiness
to
be
deceived
for
her
preoccupation
with
her
own
affairs
and
the
odious
jenkins
for
the
exuberance
of
life
which
hid
from
her
the
dwindling
of
her
mother
and
the
fact
now
so
plain
that
when
reginald
mallett
died
his
capacity
for
struggling
was
at
an
end
she
had
suffered
bitterly
from
the
sight
of
his
deterioration
and
from
her
failure
to
prevent
it
in
his
sulky
torturing
presence
she
had
desired
his
absence
but
this
permanent
absence
was
more
than
she
could
bear
and
all
henrietta
could
do
was
to
obey
her
mother
injunction
to
accept
help
from
her
aunts
but
she
had
refused
the
offer
of
an
escort
to
radstowe
and
nelson
lodge
she
would
have
no
highly
respectable
servant
sniffing
at
the
and
she
would
have
been
bound
to
sniff
in
that
permanently
scented
atmosphere
which
was
after
all
her
home
she
left
with
genuine
regret
with
tears
must
cry
dearie
banks
said
holding
henrietta
to
the
bosom
of
her
greasy
dress
a
lucky
thing
for
you
henrietta
said
i
rather
be
with
you
and
i
bear
to
think
of
the
cooking
going
to
pieces
i
send
you
some
recipes
for
nice
dishes
many
eggs
banks
said
prophetically
dare
say
but
you
can
manage
if
you
think
about
it
and
remember
if
miss
stubb
has
too
much
cold
mutton
she
lose
her
job
and
then
you
lose
her
money
it
will
pay
you
to
feed
her
you
have
had
a
debt
since
i
began
to
help
you
know
i
know
but
i
have
them
now
for
certain
i
told
you
before
that
banks
took
all
my
ideas
with
him
when
he
dropped
into
the
river
banks
said
hopelessly
and
on
henrietta
journey
to
radstowe
it
was
of
banks
that
she
chiefly
thought
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
deserting
a
friend
she
was
surprised
by
the
smallness
of
nelson
lodge
as
she
walked
up
the
garden
path
she
had
pictured
something
more
imposing
than
this
low
white
building
walled
off
from
the
wide
street
but
within
she
discovered
an
inconsistent
spaciousness
the
hall
was
panelled
in
white
wood
the
sparsely
but
beautifully
furnished
was
white
too
and
she
immediately
felt
as
indeed
she
looked
thoroughly
out
of
harmony
with
her
surroundings
she
waited
there
in
her
cheap
black
clothes
like
some
little
servant
seeking
a
situation
but
her
welcome
when
it
came
after
a
rustling
of
silken
skirts
on
the
stairs
assured
her
that
she
was
acknowledged
as
a
member
of
the
family
sophia
took
her
tenderly
to
her
heart
and
murmured
my
dear
how
like
your
father
caroline
patted
her
cheek
and
said
yes
reginald
daughter
so
she
is
and
a
moment
later
rose
entered
faintly
smiling
extending
a
cool
hand
henrietta
acutely
feminine
eye
saw
immediately
that
her
aunt
rose
was
supremely
and
all
her
past
ideas
of
grandeur
of
plumed
hats
and
feather
boas
and
ornamental
walking
shoes
left
her
for
ever
she
knew
too
that
clothes
like
these
were
very
costly
beyond
her
dreams
but
she
decided
in
a
moment
to
rearrange
and
subdue
the
black
trimming
of
her
hat
on
the
other
hand
the
appearance
of
the
elder
aunts
almost
shocked
her
at
the
first
glance
they
seemed
bedizened
and
indecent
in
their
mixture
of
rouge
and
more
than
middle
age
but
at
the
second
and
the
third
they
became
attractive
oddly
distinguished
she
felt
sure
of
them
of
their
sympathy
of
her
ability
to
please
them
it
was
aunt
rose
who
made
her
feel
ill
at
ease
and
it
was
aunt
rose
of
whom
she
thought
as
she
sat
by
her
bedroom
window
and
looked
down
at
the
back
garden
bright
with
the
flowers
of
spring
yet
it
was
aunt
caroline
who
had
been
unkind
about
her
feet
they
were
like
that
these
grand
people
they
had
beautiful
manners
but
nothing
superficial
escaped
them
they
made
no
allowances
they
went
in
for
no
deceptions
and
though
it
was
caroline
who
had
actually
condemned
the
small
strong
feet
which
now
rested
slipperless
on
the
soft
carpet
henrietta
was
sure
that
rose
had
seen
them
too
she
had
seen
everything
though
apparently
she
saw
nothing
and
henrietta
had
to
acknowledge
her
fear
of
rose
criticism
it
was
formidable
for
it
would
be
unflinching
in
its
standards
henrietta
thought
can
only
be
myself
and
if
i
common
but
i
not
really
common
it
better
than
pretending
and
of
course
i
am
rather
upset
by
the
house
and
the
servants
and
all
the
forks
and
spoons
i
hope
there
wo
be
anything
funny
to
eat
for
dinner
i
wish
to
her
own
amazement
she
burst
into
a
brief
storm
of
tears
wish
i
had
stayed
with
mrs
banks
she
had
her
place
in
the
she
was
a
power
there
and
she
missed
already
her
subtle
unrecognized
belief
in
her
superiority
over
banks
and
miss
stubb
and
jenkins
and
the
rest
she
was
also
honestly
troubled
about
the
welfare
of
the
landlady
who
was
her
only
friend
it
was
strange
to
sit
in
her
father
room
and
look
at
a
portrait
of
him
as
a
youth
hanging
on
the
wall
and
remember
that
banks
who
made
him
shudder
was
her
only
friend
she
left
her
seat
by
the
window
to
look
more
closely
at
that
portrait
and
after
a
brief
examination
she
turned
to
the
to
see
in
the
mirror
a
feminine
replica
of
the
face
on
the
wall
she
had
never
noticed
the
likeness
before
she
had
only
to
push
back
her
hair
and
she
saw
her
father
where
his
nose
was
straight
hers
was
slightly
tilted
but
there
was
the
same
darkness
of
hair
and
eyes
the
same
modelling
of
the
forehead
the
same
incipient
petulance
of
the
lips
she
was
astonished
she
was
unreasonably
pleased
and
with
the
energy
of
her
inspiration
she
swept
back
the
curls
of
which
her
mother
had
been
so
proud
and
pinned
them
into
obscurity
the
resemblance
was
extraordinary
even
the
low
white
collar
of
her
blouse
fastened
with
a
black
bow
repeated
the
somewhat
byronic
appearance
of
the
young
man
and
as
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
she
turned
a
little
but
excited
in
the
certainty
of
her
success
but
it
was
only
susan
who
gave
no
sign
of
astonishment
at
the
change
she
had
come
to
see
if
she
could
help
miss
henrietta
to
unpack
but
henrietta
had
already
laid
away
her
meagre
outfit
in
the
walnut
tallboy
with
the
curved
legs
susan
however
would
remove
the
trunk
and
if
miss
henrietta
would
tell
her
what
dress
she
wished
to
wear
this
evening
susan
would
be
able
to
lay
out
her
things
the
tin
trunk
clanked
noisily
though
susan
lifted
it
with
tactful
care
and
henrietta
blushed
for
it
but
the
aged
portmanteau
bearing
the
initials
became
in
the
discreet
presence
of
susan
a
priceless
possession
full
of
books
henrietta
said
wo
unpack
them
i
thought
my
aunts
would
let
me
keep
them
somewhere
they
are
my
books
an
old
bookcase
belonging
to
reginald
in
the
susan
said
speak
to
miss
caroline
about
it
you
know
my
father
henrietta
asked
at
once
miss
henrietta
susan
said
you
think
i
like
him
a
striking
likeness
miss
henrietta
and
warming
a
little
susan
added
was
just
saying
so
to
cook
cook
know
him
too
yes
miss
henrietta
cook
and
i
have
been
with
the
family
for
years
if
you
tell
me
which
dress
you
wish
to
wear
only
one
in
the
wardrobe
henrietta
said
serenely
for
suddenly
her
shabbiness
and
poverty
mattered
no
longer
she
was
stamped
with
the
impress
of
reginald
mallett
whom
she
had
despised
yet
of
whom
she
was
proud
and
that
impress
was
like
a
guarantee
a
sort
of
passport
she
had
a
great
lightness
of
heart
she
was
glad
she
had
left
banks
glad
she
was
in
her
father
home
and
learning
from
susan
that
the
ladies
rested
in
their
own
rooms
after
luncheon
she
decided
to
go
out
and
look
on
the
scenes
of
her
father
youth
this
was
not
she
told
herself
disloyalty
to
her
mother
for
had
not
that
mother
whom
she
loved
and
painfully
missed
sent
her
to
this
place
her
mother
was
generous
and
sweet
she
would
grudge
no
allegiance
to
reginald
mallett
had
she
not
said
they
must
remember
him
at
his
best
and
would
she
not
be
glad
if
henrietta
could
find
bits
of
that
best
in
this
old
house
in
the
streets
where
he
had
walked
in
the
sights
which
had
fed
his
eyes
henrietta
started
out
gently
closing
the
front
door
behind
her
the
wide
street
was
almost
empty
a
milkcart
bearing
the
legend
hall
dairy
was
being
drawn
at
an
easy
pace
by
a
demure
pony
his
harness
adorned
with
jingling
bells
the
milkman
whistled
and
as
the
cart
stopped
here
and
there
she
missed
the
london
milkman
harsh
cry
and
missed
it
pleasurably
this
man
was
in
no
hurry
there
was
no
impatience
in
his
knock
the
whole
place
seemed
to
be
half
asleep
except
where
children
played
on
the
green
under
the
old
trees
this
comparatively
small
space
mounting
in
the
distance
to
a
little
hill
backed
by
the
sky
was
more
wonderful
to
henrietta
than
hyde
park
when
the
flowers
were
at
their
best
there
were
no
flowers
here
she
saw
grass
two
old
stone
monuments
tall
trees
a
miniature
cliff
of
grey
rock
and
sky
on
three
sides
of
the
green
there
were
old
houses
and
there
were
seats
on
the
grass
but
houses
and
seats
had
the
air
of
being
mere
accidents
to
which
the
rest
had
grown
accustomed
and
it
seemed
to
henrietta
that
here
in
spite
of
bricks
she
was
in
the
country
the
trees
the
grass
the
rocks
and
sky
were
in
possession
she
followed
one
of
the
small
paths
round
the
hill
and
found
herself
in
a
place
so
wonderful
so
unexpected
that
she
caught
back
her
breath
and
let
it
out
again
in
low
exclamations
of
delight
she
was
now
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
and
though
she
did
not
know
it
she
was
on
the
site
of
an
ancient
camp
the
hill
was
there
were
still
signs
of
the
ramparts
but
it
was
not
on
these
she
gazed
far
below
her
was
the
river
flowing
sluggishly
in
a
deep
ravine
formed
on
her
right
hand
and
as
far
as
she
could
see
by
high
grey
cliffs
these
for
the
most
part
were
bare
and
sheer
but
they
gave
way
now
and
then
to
a
gentler
slope
with
a
rich
burden
of
trees
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
it
was
the
rocks
that
seemed
to
encroach
on
the
trees
for
the
wall
of
the
gorge
almost
to
the
water
edge
was
thick
with
woods
here
and
there
on
either
cliff
a
sudden
red
splash
of
rock
showed
like
an
unhealed
wound
amid
the
healthier
grey
and
all
around
her
there
seemed
to
be
limitless
sky
huge
fluffy
clouds
and
gulls
as
white
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
where
she
stood
gorse
bushes
bloomed
and
looking
to
the
left
she
saw
the
slender
line
of
a
bridge
swung
high
across
the
abyss
beyond
it
the
cliffs
lessened
into
banks
then
into
meadows
studded
with
big
elms
and
on
the
city
side
there
were
houses
red
and
grey
as
though
the
rocks
had
simply
changed
their
shapes
the
houses
were
clustered
close
to
the
water
they
rose
in
terraces
and
trees
mingled
with
their
chimneys
below
there
were
intricate
waterways
little
bridges
warehouses
and
ships
and
high
up
the
fairy
bridge
delicate
and
poised
was
like
a
barrier
between
that
place
of
business
and
activity
and
this
where
henrietta
stood
with
the
trees
the
cliffs
the
swooping
gulls
it
was
low
tide
and
the
river
was
bordered
by
banks
of
mud
grey
too
yet
opalescent
it
almost
reflected
the
startling
white
of
the
gulls
wings
and
as
she
looked
at
it
she
saw
that
its
colour
was
made
up
of
many
there
was
pink
in
it
and
blue
and
as
a
big
cloud
passed
over
the
sun
it
became
subtly
purple
it
was
a
palette
of
subdued
and
tender
shades
henrietta
heaved
a
sigh
this
was
too
much
she
could
look
at
it
but
she
could
not
see
it
all
yet
this
marvellous
place
belonged
to
her
and
she
knew
now
whence
had
come
the
glamour
in
the
stories
her
father
had
told
her
when
she
was
a
child
it
had
come
from
here
where
an
aged
city
had
tried
to
conquer
the
country
and
had
failed
for
the
spirit
of
woods
and
open
spaces
of
water
and
trees
and
wind
survived
among
the
very
roofs
the
conventions
of
the
centuries
the
convention
of
puritanism
of
worldliness
of
impiety
of
materialism
and
of
charity
had
all
assailed
and
all
fallen
back
before
the
strength
of
the
apparently
peaceful
country
in
which
the
city
stood
the
air
was
soft
with
a
peculiar
undermining
softness
it
carried
with
it
a
smell
of
flowers
and
fruit
and
earth
and
if
all
the
many
miles
on
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
should
be
ravished
by
men
hands
covered
with
buildings
and
strewn
with
the
ugly
luxuries
they
thought
they
needed
the
spirit
would
remain
in
the
tainted
air
and
the
imprisoned
earth
it
would
whisper
at
night
at
the
windows
it
would
smile
invisibly
under
the
sun
it
would
steal
into
men
minds
and
work
its
will
upon
them
and
already
henrietta
felt
its
power
she
was
in
a
new
world
dull
but
magical
torpid
yet
alert
she
turned
away
and
walking
down
another
little
path
threaded
through
the
rocks
she
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
and
watched
people
on
foot
people
on
bicycles
people
in
carts
coming
and
going
over
it
she
could
not
cross
herself
for
she
had
not
a
penny
in
her
pocket
but
she
stood
there
gazing
and
sometimes
looking
down
at
the
road
two
hundred
feet
below
this
made
her
slightly
giddy
and
the
people
down
there
had
too
much
the
appearance
of
pigmies
with
legs
growing
from
their
necks
going
about
perfectly
unimportant
business
with
a
great
deal
of
fuss
it
was
pleasanter
to
see
these
country
people
in
their
carts
with
plaits
down
their
backs
rosy
children
in
perambulators
and
an
exceedingly
handsome
man
on
a
fine
black
horse
a
fair
man
bronzed
like
a
soldier
riding
as
though
he
had
done
it
all
his
life
she
looked
at
him
with
admiration
for
his
looks
and
envy
for
his
possessions
for
that
horse
that
somewhat
sulky
ease
and
it
was
quite
possible
that
he
was
an
acquaintance
of
her
aunts
she
laughed
away
her
awed
astonishment
why
her
own
father
had
been
such
as
he
though
she
had
never
seen
him
on
a
horse
she
had
after
all
to
adjust
her
views
a
little
to
remember
that
she
was
a
mallett
a
member
of
an
honoured
radstowe
family
the
granddaughter
of
a
general
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
though
a
scamp
she
was
ashamed
of
the
something
approaching
reverence
with
which
she
had
looked
at
the
man
on
the
horse
but
she
was
also
ashamed
of
her
shame
in
fact
to
be
ashamed
at
all
was
she
felt
a
degradation
and
she
cast
the
feeling
from
her
here
was
not
only
a
new
world
but
a
new
life
a
new
starting
point
she
must
be
equal
to
the
place
the
opportunity
and
the
occasion
she
was
she
told
herself
equal
to
them
all
in
this
mood
she
returned
to
nelson
lodge
and
found
caroline
in
a
different
frock
seated
behind
the
and
in
the
act
of
putting
the
tea
into
the
pot
in
time
she
remarked
and
added
with
intense
interest
have
brushed
back
your
hair
excellent
look
sophia
what
an
improvement
and
more
like
reginald
than
ever
take
off
your
hat
child
and
let
us
see
my
dear
i
was
going
to
tell
you
when
i
knew
you
better
that
those
curls
made
you
look
like
an
do
hush
me
sophia
i
always
say
what
i
think
henrietta
was
hurt
this
though
caroline
did
not
know
it
was
a
rebuff
to
the
mother
who
loved
the
curls
but
the
daughter
would
not
betray
her
sensibility
and
as
rose
was
not
present
she
dared
to
say
with
square
feet
you
heard
that
did
you
sophia
said
you
would
well
you
must
be
careful
about
your
shoes
men
always
look
at
a
woman
feet
she
displayed
her
own
elegantly
arched
in
lustrous
stockings
and
very
slippers
and
i
sophia
are
nearly
but
not
quite
as
good
as
mine
are
they
sophia
sophia
and
i
have
always
been
particular
about
our
feet
i
remember
a
ball
when
i
was
a
girl
where
one
of
my
partners
he
ended
by
marrying
a
ridiculously
fat
woman
with
feet
like
cannon
balls
insisted
on
calling
me
cinderella
because
he
said
nobody
else
could
have
worn
my
shoes
delightful
creature
do
you
remember
sophia
sophia
remembered
very
well
he
had
called
her
cinderella
too
for
the
same
reason
but
as
caroline
had
been
the
first
to
report
the
remark
sophia
had
never
cared
to
spoil
her
pleasure
in
it
and
now
caroline
did
not
wait
for
a
reply
rose
entering
at
that
moment
and
her
attention
having
to
be
called
to
the
change
in
henrietta
method
of
doing
her
hair
henrietta
stiffened
at
once
but
rose
threw
as
it
were
a
smile
in
her
direction
and
said
charming
and
helped
herself
to
cake
now
said
caroline
settling
herself
for
the
most
interesting
subject
in
the
world
clothes
henrietta
have
any
henrietta
said
at
once
i
think
they
do
until
i
go
away
i
thought
i
should
like
to
be
a
nurse
aunt
caroline
nonsense
what
kind
babies
rubbish
you
going
to
stay
here
if
you
like
us
well
enough
and
we
made
a
little
plan
she
nodded
vigorously
little
plan
for
you
ought
to
say
at
once
sophia
interrupted
with
painful
honesty
it
was
rose
idea
was
it
i
do
know
anyhow
we
all
agreed
you
are
to
have
a
sum
of
money
child
yes
for
your
father
sake
and
perhaps
for
your
own
too
a
sum
of
money
to
bring
you
in
a
little
income
for
your
clothes
and
pleasures
so
that
you
shall
be
independent
like
the
rest
of
us
yes
it
settled
i
written
to
our
lawyer
james
batty
did
your
father
ever
mention
james
batty
but
of
course
he
would
he
married
a
fat
woman
too
but
a
good
soul
with
a
high
colour
poor
thing
do
say
a
word
child
you
must
be
independent
nursing
bah
and
if
we
do
take
care
we
shall
have
you
marrying
for
a
home
is
your
home
sophia
said
gently
sentiment
sophia
please
you
making
the
child
cry
the
malletts
do
marry
henrietta
look
at
us
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
with
all
the
fun
and
none
of
the
trouble
we
been
terrible
flirts
sophia
and
i
rose
is
different
but
at
least
she
married
the
three
miss
malletts
of
nelson
lodge
now
there
are
four
of
us
and
you
must
keep
up
our
reputation
overwhelmed
by
this
generosity
by
this
kindness
henrietta
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
murmured
something
about
her
mother
wish
that
she
should
earn
her
living
but
caroline
scouted
the
idea
and
sophia
putting
her
white
hand
on
one
of
henrietta
assured
her
that
her
dear
mother
would
be
glad
for
her
child
to
have
the
comforts
of
a
home
not
used
to
them
henrietta
said
always
taken
care
of
people
i
sha
know
what
to
do
they
would
find
plenty
for
her
to
do
there
were
many
gaieties
in
radstowe
and
she
would
be
welcomed
everywhere
now
about
your
clothes
caroline
repeated
are
wearing
black
of
course
well
black
can
be
very
pretty
very
french
look
at
rose
she
rarely
wears
anything
else
but
when
sophia
and
i
were
about
your
age
she
used
to
wear
blue
and
i
wore
pink
or
the
other
way
round
do
so
still
rose
remarked
pink
muslin
caroline
went
on
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
leghorn
hat
wreathed
with
pink
roses
when
was
i
wearing
that
sophia
summer
rose
said
dryly
i
was
caroline
agreed
in
a
voice
henrietta
get
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
sophia
and
we
make
a
list
the
discussion
went
on
endlessly
long
after
henrietta
herself
had
tired
of
it
it
was
lengthened
by
the
insertion
of
anecdotes
of
caroline
and
sophia
youth
and
hardly
a
colour
or
a
material
was
mentioned
which
did
not
recall
an
incident
which
henrietta
found
more
interesting
than
her
own
sartorial
affairs
rose
had
disappeared
and
the
was
rung
before
the
subject
languished
it
would
never
be
exhausted
for
caroline
and
even
sophia
less
vivid
than
her
sister
in
all
but
her
affections
grew
pink
and
in
considering
henrietta
points
and
all
the
time
henrietta
had
her
own
opinions
her
own
plans
she
intended
as
far
as
possible
to
preserve
her
likeness
to
her
father
which
was
as
it
were
her
she
pictured
herself
youthfully
slim
gravely
petulant
her
round
neck
rising
from
a
byronic
collar
fastened
with
a
broad
loose
bow
and
she
fancied
the
society
of
radstowe
exclaiming
with
one
voice
must
be
reginald
mallett
daughter
she
was
to
learn
however
that
in
radstowe
the
memories
of
reginald
mallett
were
somewhat
dim
and
where
they
were
clear
they
were
neglected
it
was
generally
assumed
that
his
daughter
would
not
care
to
have
him
mentioned
while
praises
of
her
aunts
were
constant
and
enthusiastic
and
people
were
kind
to
henrietta
she
discovered
for
their
sakes
the
stout
and
batty
was
an
early
caller
she
arrived
rather
wheezy
compressed
by
her
tailor
into
an
expensive
gown
a
basket
of
spring
flowers
on
her
head
she
and
henrietta
took
to
each
other
as
batty
said
at
once
here
was
a
motherly
person
and
henrietta
knew
that
if
she
could
have
batty
to
herself
she
would
be
able
to
talk
more
freely
than
she
had
done
since
her
arrival
in
radstowe
there
would
be
no
criticism
from
her
but
unlimited
good
nature
a
readiness
to
listen
and
to
confide
and
a
love
for
the
details
of
operations
and
illnesses
in
which
she
had
a
kinship
with
banks
indeed
though
batty
was
fat
where
banks
was
thin
cheerful
where
she
was
gloomy
and
in
possession
of
a
flourishing
husband
where
banks
irritably
mourned
the
loss
of
a
suicide
they
had
characteristics
in
common
and
the
chief
of
these
was
the
way
in
which
they
took
to
henrietta
must
come
to
tea
on
sunday
batty
said
are
always
at
home
on
sunday
afternoons
after
four
i
have
two
big
boys
she
sighed
all
their
friends
are
welcome
then
she
lowered
her
voice
do
allow
tennis
the
neighbours
you
know
and
james
has
clients
looking
out
of
every
window
but
there
no
harm
as
the
boys
say
in
knocking
the
billiard
balls
about
i
must
say
the
click
carries
a
good
way
so
i
tell
the
parlourmaid
to
shut
the
windows
and
music
my
boy
charles
she
sighed
again
mad
on
music
i
like
a
tune
myself
but
he
never
plays
any
you
hear
for
yourself
if
you
come
on
sunday
now
you
will
come
wo
you
miss
henrietta
she
come
caroline
said
her
good
to
meet
young
people
we
getting
old
in
this
house
batty
and
she
guffawed
in
anticipation
of
the
usual
denial
but
for
once
batty
failed
her
thoughts
were
at
home
at
prospect
house
that
commodious
family
mansion
situate
in
its
own
grounds
and
in
one
of
the
most
favourable
positions
in
upper
radstowe
so
the
advertisement
had
read
before
batty
bought
the
property
and
it
was
all
true
batty
went
on
more
for
sport
though
he
in
the
sugar
business
with
an
uncle
not
my
brother
mr
batty
she
was
anxious
to
give
her
husband
all
the
credit
are
both
good
boys
she
added
charles
well
you
see
on
sunday
you
promise
to
come
henrietta
promised
and
with
batty
departure
caroline
spoke
her
mind
she
was
convinced
that
the
lawyer
and
his
wife
were
determined
to
secure
henrietta
as
a
knows
all
our
affairs
my
dear
and
james
batty
never
misses
a
chance
of
improving
his
position
good
as
it
is
it
would
be
all
the
better
for
an
alliance
with
our
family
but
i
shall
disown
you
at
once
if
you
marry
one
of
those
hobbledehoys
the
batty
indeed
why
batty
herself
do
sophia
pleaded
i
sure
the
young
men
are
very
nice
young
men
and
if
henrietta
should
fall
in
love
wo
get
any
of
my
money
caroline
said
henrietta
wo
be
in
a
hurry
sophia
announced
and
so
over
her
head
the
two
discussed
her
possible
marriage
as
they
had
discussed
her
clothes
but
with
less
interest
and
at
less
length
and
as
before
henrietta
had
her
own
ideas
a
rich
man
a
handsome
one
a
gay
life
no
more
basement
kitchens
no
more
mutton
bones
already
the
influence
of
nelson
lodge
was
making
itself
felt
it
was
at
dinner
that
the
charm
of
the
house
was
most
apparent
to
henrietta
even
on
these
spring
evenings
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
the
candles
lighted
for
caroline
said
she
could
not
dine
comfortably
in
daylight
the
pale
flames
were
repeated
in
the
mahogany
of
the
table
the
tall
candlesticks
the
silver
appointments
were
reflected
also
in
a
blur
like
a
grey
mist
the
furniture
against
the
walls
became
merged
into
the
shadows
and
susan
hovering
there
was
no
more
than
an
attentive
spirit
there
was
little
talking
at
this
meal
for
caroline
and
sophia
loved
good
food
and
it
was
very
good
occasionally
caroline
murmured
much
pepper
or
more
pinch
of
salt
and
this
would
have
been
perfect
and
bending
over
her
plate
the
diamonds
in
her
ears
sparkled
to
her
movements
the
rings
on
her
fingers
glittered
and
opposite
to
her
sophia
drooped
her
pale
hair
looking
almost
white
the
big
sapphire
cross
on
her
breast
gleaming
richly
her
resigned
attitude
oddly
at
variance
with
the
busy
handling
of
her
knife
and
fork
the
gold
frame
round
general
mallett
portrait
dimly
shone
the
flowers
on
the
table
seemed
to
give
out
their
beauty
and
their
scent
with
conscious
desire
to
please
to
add
their
offerings
and
for
henrietta
the
grotesqueness
of
the
elder
aunts
their
gay
attire
their
rouge
and
wrinkles
gave
a
touch
of
fantasy
to
what
would
otherwise
have
been
too
orderly
and
too
respectable
a
scene
in
this
room
of
beautiful
inherited
things
where
tradition
had
built
strong
walls
about
the
malletts
the
sight
of
caroline
was
like
a
gate
leading
into
the
wide
uncertain
world
and
the
sight
of
rose
all
cream
and
black
was
like
a
secret
portal
leading
to
a
winding
stair
at
this
hour
romance
was
in
the
house
beckoning
henrietta
to
follow
through
that
gate
or
down
that
stair
but
chiefly
hovering
about
the
figure
of
rose
who
sat
so
straight
and
kept
so
silent
her
white
hands
moving
slowly
the
pearls
glistening
on
her
neck
her
face
a
pale
oval
against
the
darkness
she
was
never
more
mysterious
or
more
remote
with
her
even
the
common
acts
of
eating
and
drinking
seemed
to
henrietta
to
be
made
poetical
she
was
different
from
everybody
else
but
the
girl
felt
vaguely
that
the
wildness
of
which
caroline
made
a
boast
and
which
never
developed
into
more
than
that
the
wildness
which
had
ruined
her
father
life
lay
numbed
and
checked
somewhere
behind
the
amazing
stillness
and
control
of
rose
and
she
was
like
a
woman
who
had
suffered
a
great
sorrow
or
who
kept
a
profound
secret
it
was
at
this
hour
when
henrietta
was
half
awed
half
soothed
yet
very
much
alive
feeling
that
tremendous
excitements
lay
in
wait
for
her
just
outside
when
she
was
wrapped
in
beauty
fed
by
delicate
food
sensitive
to
the
slim
old
silver
under
her
hands
that
she
sometimes
felt
herself
actually
carried
back
to
the
and
she
saw
the
grimy
tablecloth
the
flaring
gas
jets
the
tired
worn
faces
the
dusty
hair
of
banks
and
the
rubber
collar
of
jenkins
and
she
heard
little
miss
stubb
uttering
platitudes
in
her
attempt
to
raise
the
mental
atmosphere
there
was
a
great
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
a
confusion
of
voices
and
in
a
pause
the
sound
of
the
exclusive
old
gentleman
masticating
his
food
then
henrietta
would
close
her
eyes
and
after
an
instant
she
would
open
them
on
this
room
the
lovely
figure
of
aunt
rose
the
silks
and
laces
and
ornaments
of
aunt
caroline
and
aunt
sophia
and
between
the
courses
one
of
these
two
would
repeat
the
gossip
of
a
caller
or
criticize
the
cut
of
her
dress
no
the
conversation
was
not
much
better
than
that
of
the
house
but
the
accents
were
different
caroline
would
throw
out
a
french
phrase
and
henrietta
loving
the
present
wondering
how
she
had
borne
the
past
could
yet
feel
fiercely
that
life
was
not
fair
she
herself
was
not
fair
she
was
giving
her
allegiance
to
the
outside
of
things
and
finding
in
them
more
pleasure
than
in
heroism
endurance
and
compassion
and
she
said
to
herself
i
just
like
my
father
i
see
too
much
with
my
eyes
a
little
fear
which
had
its
own
delight
took
hold
of
her
how
far
would
that
likeness
carry
her
what
dangerous
qualities
had
he
passed
on
to
her
with
his
looks
she
sat
there
vividly
conscious
of
herself
and
sometimes
she
saw
the
whole
room
as
a
picture
and
she
was
part
of
it
sometimes
she
saw
only
those
three
whose
lives
she
felt
were
practically
over
for
even
aunt
rose
was
comparatively
old
she
pitied
them
because
their
romance
was
past
while
hers
waited
for
her
outside
she
wondered
at
their
happiness
their
interest
in
their
appearance
their
pleasure
in
parties
but
she
felt
most
sorry
for
aunt
rose
midway
between
what
should
have
been
the
resignation
of
her
stepsisters
and
the
glowing
anticipation
of
her
niece
yet
aunt
rose
hardly
invited
sympathy
of
any
kind
and
the
smile
always
lurking
near
her
lips
gave
henrietta
a
feeling
of
discomfort
a
suspicion
that
aunt
rose
was
not
only
ironically
aware
of
what
henrietta
wished
to
conceal
but
endowed
with
a
fund
of
wisdom
and
a
supply
of
worldly
knowledge
she
continued
to
feel
uncertain
about
aunt
rose
she
was
always
charming
to
henrietta
but
it
was
impossible
to
be
quite
at
ease
with
a
being
who
seemed
to
make
an
art
of
being
delicately
reserved
and
because
henrietta
liked
to
establish
relationships
in
which
she
was
sure
of
herself
and
her
power
to
please
she
was
conscious
of
a
faint
feeling
of
antagonism
towards
this
person
who
made
her
doubt
herself
aunt
caroline
and
aunt
sophia
were
evidently
delighted
with
their
niece
presence
in
the
house
they
liked
the
sound
of
her
laughter
and
her
gay
voice
and
though
sophia
once
gently
reproached
her
for
her
habit
of
whistling
which
was
not
that
of
a
young
lady
caroline
scoffed
at
her
sister
the
girl
whistle
if
she
wants
to
she
said
better
than
having
a
canary
in
a
cage
do
do
it
too
much
henrietta
dear
sophia
compromised
must
get
wrinkles
round
your
mouth
this
was
a
consideration
which
appealed
to
caroline
child
you
must
do
that
they
admitted
her
to
a
familiarity
which
they
would
not
have
allowed
her
and
which
she
never
attempted
to
exceed
but
she
was
daughter
she
was
a
member
of
the
family
and
her
offence
in
being
also
the
daughter
of
her
mother
was
forgotten
caroline
and
sophia
were
deeply
interested
in
henrietta
henrietta
was
grateful
and
affectionate
the
three
were
naturally
congenial
and
the
happiness
and
sympathy
of
the
trio
accentuated
the
pleasant
aloofness
of
rose
aunt
rose
did
not
care
for
her
henrietta
told
herself
there
was
something
odd
about
aunt
rose
yet
she
remembered
that
it
was
aunt
rose
who
had
thought
of
giving
her
the
money
three
thousand
pounds
it
was
a
fortune
and
on
that
sunday
when
henrietta
was
to
pay
her
first
visit
to
batty
aunt
caroline
turning
the
girl
about
to
see
that
nothing
was
amiss
said
warningly
are
walking
into
the
lion
den
henrietta
do
let
one
of
those
young
cubs
gobble
you
up
i
know
james
batty
an
attractive
man
but
he
loves
money
and
he
knows
our
affairs
he
married
his
own
wife
because
she
was
a
butcher
daughter
wholesale
butcher
sophia
murmured
in
extenuation
i
am
sure
he
loved
her
butchers
caroline
went
on
amass
money
it
positively
inclines
one
to
vegetarianism
though
i
sure
nuts
are
bad
for
the
complexion
do
intend
to
be
eaten
yet
henrietta
said
gaily
she
was
very
much
excited
and
she
hardly
heeded
sophia
whisper
at
the
door
not
true
dear
the
kindest
people
in
the
world
but
caroline
has
such
a
sense
of
humour
henrietta
found
that
the
batty
lions
were
luxuriously
housed
the
bright
yellow
gravel
crunched
under
her
feet
as
she
walked
up
the
drive
the
porch
was
bright
with
flowering
plants
arranged
in
tiers
a
parlourmaid
opened
the
door
as
though
she
conferred
a
privilege
and
as
henrietta
passed
through
the
hall
she
had
glimpses
of
a
statue
holding
a
large
fern
and
another
bearing
a
lamp
aloft
she
was
impressed
by
this
magnificence
she
wished
she
could
pause
to
examine
this
decently
draped
and
useful
statuary
but
she
was
ushered
into
a
large
somewhat
scented
with
flowers
softly
carpeted
and
she
immediately
found
herself
in
the
embrace
of
batty
who
smelt
of
batty
felt
soft
too
and
if
she
were
a
lioness
there
were
no
signs
of
claws
or
fangs
and
her
husband
a
tall
spare
man
with
grey
hair
and
a
face
bowed
over
hand
in
a
courtly
manner
hardly
to
be
expected
of
the
of
wild
beasts
but
for
these
two
the
room
seemed
to
be
empty
until
batty
said
in
a
tone
of
timid
authority
and
henrietta
discovered
that
a
fair
young
man
already
showing
a
tendency
to
baldness
was
sitting
at
the
piano
apparently
studying
a
sheet
of
music
this
then
was
one
of
the
cubs
and
henrietta
feeling
herself
marvellously
at
ease
in
this
house
awaited
his
approach
with
some
amusement
and
a
little
irritation
at
his
obvious
lack
of
interest
aunt
caroline
need
have
no
fear
he
was
a
plain
young
man
with
pale
vague
eyes
and
he
did
not
know
whether
to
offer
one
of
his
nervous
hands
at
the
end
of
arms
or
to
make
shift
with
an
awkward
bow
she
settled
the
matter
for
him
feeling
very
much
a
woman
of
the
world
where
john
batty
asked
and
charles
answered
in
the
stable
batty
clucked
with
vexation
the
first
sunday
for
weeks
that
i
have
had
the
room
full
of
people
now
you
wo
want
to
come
again
very
dull
for
a
young
girl
i
sure
well
you
can
have
a
chat
with
miss
henrietta
batty
said
afterwards
perhaps
she
would
like
to
see
my
flowers
he
disappeared
with
extraordinary
skill
with
the
strange
effect
of
not
having
left
the
room
yet
batty
sighed
charles
had
wandered
back
to
the
piano
and
his
mother
after
compressing
her
lips
and
whispering
a
mania
drew
henrietta
into
the
depths
of
a
settee
he
play
to
us
she
asked
no
batty
answered
hastily
so
particular
why
if
i
asked
you
to
have
another
cup
of
tea
he
shut
the
piano
and
that
makes
things
very
uncomfortable
indeed
you
can
imagine
and
john
has
this
new
dog
really
i
do
think
it
right
on
a
sunday
it
all
dogs
and
cricket
with
him
well
cricket
better
than
football
for
really
on
a
saturday
in
the
winter
i
never
know
whether
i
shall
see
him
dead
or
alive
i
do
wish
i
had
a
girl
she
took
hand
you
poor
dear
child
without
a
mother
what
was
it
she
died
of
my
dear
ah
you
miss
her
you
miss
her
my
own
dear
mother
died
the
day
after
i
was
married
and
i
said
to
batty
this
can
bode
no
good
we
had
to
come
straight
back
from
bournemouth
where
we
gone
for
our
honeymoon
and
by
the
time
i
was
out
of
black
my
trousseau
was
out
of
fashion
i
must
say
batty
was
very
good
about
it
it
was
her
heart
what
with
excitement
and
all
that
she
was
a
stout
woman
all
my
side
runs
to
stoutness
but
batty
family
are
like
well
i
believe
it
healthier
and
i
must
say
the
boys
take
after
him
now
i
fancy
you
rather
like
miss
rose
say
i
am
just
like
my
father
batty
said
with
meaning
and
henrietta
tried
to
sit
straighter
on
the
seductive
settee
she
could
not
allow
batty
to
utter
insinuating
ejaculations
and
raising
her
voice
she
said
batty
do
play
something
charles
batty
gazed
at
her
over
the
shining
surface
of
the
grand
piano
and
looked
remarkably
like
an
owl
an
owl
that
had
lost
its
feathers
what
exclaimed
batty
i
do
know
henrietta
murmured
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
a
pictorial
piece
of
music
her
mother
had
sometimes
played
on
the
piano
with
the
growling
of
the
twittering
of
birds
after
rain
and
a
suggestion
of
church
bells
but
she
was
determined
not
to
betray
herself
you
like
he
broke
into
a
popular
waltz
playing
it
derisively
yet
with
passion
so
that
batty
ponderous
head
began
to
sway
and
henrietta
feet
to
tap
he
played
as
though
his
heart
were
in
the
dance
and
to
henrietta
there
came
delightful
visions
thrilling
sensations
unaccountable
yearnings
it
was
like
the
music
she
had
heard
at
the
theatre
but
more
beautiful
her
eyes
widened
but
she
kept
them
lowered
her
mouth
softened
and
she
caught
her
lip
i
call
that
lovely
batty
said
with
the
last
chord
his
look
questioned
henrietta
and
she
cautious
simply
smiled
at
him
with
a
tilt
of
the
lips
a
little
raising
of
the
eyebrows
meant
to
assure
him
that
she
felt
as
he
did
you
play
a
pretty
tune
like
that
now
and
then
people
would
be
glad
to
listen
batty
went
on
sure
i
quite
enjoyed
it
henrietta
suspicions
were
confirmed
by
these
eulogies
she
knew
already
that
what
batty
appreciated
her
son
would
despise
and
she
kept
her
little
smile
saying
tactfully
certainly
made
one
want
to
dance
you
sing
he
asked
a
little
she
became
timid
going
to
learn
with
those
vague
eyes
staring
at
her
she
felt
the
need
of
justification
caroline
says
every
girl
ought
to
sing
she
and
aunt
sophia
used
to
sing
duets
heavens
the
exclamation
came
from
the
depths
of
charles
batty
being
do
do
it
now
do
they
henrietta
pretty
laughter
rang
out
not
now
but
though
she
laughed
there
came
to
her
a
rather
charming
picture
of
her
aunts
in
full
skirts
and
bustles
their
white
shoulders
bare
with
sashes
round
their
waists
and
a
sheet
of
music
shared
their
mouths
open
their
eyes
cast
upwards
girl
ought
to
sing
charles
quoted
and
suddenly
darted
at
henrietta
the
word
well
it
was
ridiculous
to
be
discomposed
by
this
young
man
to
whom
she
was
sure
she
was
naturally
superior
but
sitting
behind
that
piano
as
though
it
were
a
pulpit
he
had
an
air
of
authority
and
she
was
anxious
to
propitiate
him
henrietta
repeated
hanging
on
the
word
your
own
glorification
that
all
charles
told
her
all
he
caught
his
head
in
his
hands
drives
me
mad
batty
said
again
that
word
seemed
to
be
the
whole
extent
of
her
intercourse
with
him
music
divine
and
people
get
up
and
squeak
how
they
dare
a
violation
of
the
temple
dear
me
batty
groaned
play
the
piano
yourself
henrietta
said
i
can
i
show
you
if
you
cared
about
it
think
i
would
rather
go
and
see
batty
flowers
dear
do
charles
take
her
to
your
father
batty
was
very
hot
it
would
be
a
relief
to
her
to
heave
and
sigh
alone
charles
rose
and
advanced
stooping
a
little
carrying
his
arms
as
though
they
did
not
belong
to
him
and
in
the
hall
beside
one
of
the
gleaming
statues
he
paused
offended
you
he
said
miserably
make
mistakes
somehow
nobody
explains
i
shall
do
it
again
were
rather
rude
henrietta
said
should
you
assume
that
i
squeak
to
charles
said
hopelessly
gurgle
look
here
i
teach
you
myself
if
you
like
wo
be
bullied
you
never
learn
anything
women
are
funny
he
said
then
everybody
is
do
you
know
i
have
a
single
friend
in
the
world
not
he
shook
his
head
do
know
i
do
get
on
it
comes
to
that
i
have
a
friend
of
my
own
age
either
and
you
have
a
brother
charles
said
eloquently
hear
the
noise
he
handed
her
over
to
his
father
care
she
was
more
than
satisfied
with
her
afternoon
she
did
not
see
john
batty
but
she
heard
the
noise
she
was
aware
that
batty
considered
her
a
delightful
young
person
she
had
sufficiently
admired
his
flowers
and
he
presented
her
with
a
bunch
of
orchids
for
batty
she
felt
an
amused
affection
she
was
interested
in
the
unfortunate
charles
she
felt
her
life
widening
pleasantly
and
as
she
crunched
again
down
the
gravel
drive
the
orchids
in
her
hand
she
felt
a
disinclination
to
go
home
she
wanted
to
walk
under
the
great
trees
which
spread
with
brilliant
green
made
a
long
avenue
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
to
wander
beyond
them
where
a
belt
of
grass
led
to
a
wild
shrubbery
overlooking
the
gorge
at
its
lowest
point
here
there
were
unexpected
little
paths
running
out
to
promontories
of
the
cliff
and
at
a
sudden
turn
she
would
find
herself
in
what
looked
almost
like
danger
below
her
the
rock
was
at
an
angle
to
harbour
hawthorn
trees
all
in
bud
blazing
gorse
bushes
bracken
stiffly
uncurling
itself
and
many
kinds
of
grasses
but
there
were
nearly
two
hundred
feet
between
her
and
the
river
now
at
flood
and
she
felt
that
this
was
something
of
an
adventure
she
followed
each
little
path
in
turn
half
fearfully
for
she
was
used
to
a
policeman
at
every
corner
but
she
met
no
tramp
saw
no
character
and
finding
a
seat
under
a
hawthorn
tree
at
a
little
distance
from
the
cliff
edge
she
sat
down
and
put
the
orchids
beside
her
it
was
part
of
the
strange
change
in
her
fortune
that
she
should
actually
be
handling
such
rare
flowers
she
had
seen
them
in
windows
insolently
putting
out
their
tongues
at
people
like
herself
who
rudely
stared
and
now
she
was
touching
them
and
they
looked
quite
polite
and
she
thought
with
the
bitterness
which
bred
of
her
experiences
constantly
rose
up
in
the
midst
of
pleasures
because
they
know
i
have
three
thousand
pounds
and
six
pairs
of
silk
stockings
then
she
noticed
that
one
of
the
flowers
was
missing
a
little
one
of
a
fairy
pink
and
shape
and
almost
immediately
she
heard
footsteps
on
the
grass
and
saw
a
man
approaching
with
the
orchid
in
his
hand
she
recognized
the
man
she
had
seen
riding
the
black
horse
on
the
day
she
arrived
in
radstowe
and
her
heart
fluttered
this
was
romance
this
she
had
time
to
think
excitedly
must
be
preordained
but
when
he
handed
her
the
flower
with
a
polite
think
you
dropped
this
she
wished
he
had
chosen
to
keep
the
trophy
if
she
had
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
him
conceal
it
she
said
nervously
yes
thank
you
very
much
i
just
missed
it
and
as
he
turned
away
she
had
at
least
the
minor
joy
of
seeing
a
look
of
arrested
interest
in
his
eyes
she
sat
there
holding
the
frail
and
almost
sacred
branch
she
supposed
she
was
in
love
there
was
no
other
explanation
of
her
feelings
and
what
a
marvellous
sequence
of
events
if
batty
had
not
given
her
the
orchids
this
romantic
episode
could
not
have
happened
and
she
was
glad
that
the
eyes
of
the
stranger
had
not
rested
on
her
that
first
day
when
she
was
wearing
her
shabby
her
atrociously
cut
clothes
fate
had
been
kind
in
allowing
him
to
see
her
thus
in
a
black
dress
with
a
broad
white
collar
a
carefully
careless
bow
silk
stockings
covering
her
matchless
ankles
and
she
glanced
down
shoes
that
did
their
best
to
conceal
the
squareness
of
her
feet
she
recognized
her
own
absurdity
but
she
liked
it
she
had
leisure
in
which
to
be
absurd
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
romance
which
had
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
her
outside
nelson
lodge
had
now
met
her
in
the
open
she
was
not
going
to
pass
it
by
this
was
she
knew
no
more
than
a
precious
secret
a
little
game
she
could
play
all
by
herself
but
it
had
suddenly
coloured
vividly
a
life
which
was
already
opening
wider
and
she
would
have
been
astonished
and
perhaps
disgusted
to
learn
that
aunt
rose
had
once
occupied
herself
with
similar
dreamings
but
she
was
spared
that
knowledge
and
she
was
tempted
to
wait
in
her
place
on
the
chance
that
the
stranger
would
return
but
deciding
that
it
was
hardly
what
a
mallett
would
do
she
rose
reluctantly
carrying
the
pink
orchid
in
one
hand
the
less
favoured
ones
in
the
other
the
evening
was
exquisite
she
saw
a
sky
fretted
with
green
leaves
striped
with
tree
trunks
astonishingly
black
she
heard
steamers
threshing
through
the
water
and
giving
out
warning
whistles
sounds
to
stir
the
heart
with
the
thoughts
of
voyage
of
danger
and
of
unknown
lands
and
as
she
walked
up
the
long
avenue
of
elms
she
found
that
all
the
people
strolling
out
after
tea
for
an
evening
walk
had
happy
pleasant
faces
she
met
fathers
and
mothers
in
loitering
advance
of
children
shy
lovers
with
no
words
for
each
other
an
old
lady
in
a
bath
chair
propelled
by
a
man
as
old
young
men
in
check
caps
with
flowers
in
their
coats
earnest
people
carrying
and
umbrellas
girls
with
linked
arms
and
shrill
laughter
and
she
envied
none
of
them
not
the
children
finding
interest
in
everything
they
saw
not
the
parents
proud
in
possession
not
the
old
lady
whose
work
was
done
not
the
young
men
and
women
eyeing
each
other
and
letting
out
their
enticing
laughter
she
envied
no
one
in
the
world
she
had
found
an
occupation
and
that
night
sitting
at
the
she
was
conscious
of
the
difference
in
herself
and
of
a
new
kinship
with
these
women
the
two
who
could
look
back
on
adventures
rosy
and
poetic
the
one
who
seemed
shrouded
in
some
delicate
mystery
it
was
as
though
she
too
had
been
initiated
she
was
surer
of
herself
even
in
the
presence
of
aunt
rose
with
her
beauty
like
that
of
a
white
flower
the
faint
irony
of
her
smile
a
few
days
later
rose
said
want
to
take
you
to
see
a
friend
of
mine
a
mrs
sales
the
milkcarts
belong
to
them
henrietta
asked
at
once
rose
was
amused
sales
is
an
invalid
and
she
would
like
to
see
you
shall
we
go
on
saturday
she
added
as
she
left
the
room
sales
was
hurt
in
a
hunting
accident
but
you
need
not
avoid
the
subject
she
likes
to
talk
about
it
a
good
thing
henrietta
said
practically
aunt
rose
was
dressed
for
walking
and
henrietta
was
afraid
of
being
asked
to
go
with
her
but
aunt
rose
made
no
such
suggestion
since
sunday
henrietta
had
been
exploring
radstowe
and
its
suburbs
with
an
enthusiasm
surprising
to
the
elder
aunts
who
did
not
care
for
exercise
but
henrietta
was
as
much
inspired
by
the
hope
of
seeing
that
man
again
as
by
interest
in
the
old
streets
the
unexpected
alleys
the
flights
of
worn
steps
leading
from
upper
to
lower
radstowe
the
slums
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
garden
of
some
old
house
the
big
houses
deteriorated
into
tenements
all
these
had
their
own
charm
and
the
added
one
of
having
been
familiar
to
her
father
but
she
never
forgot
to
watch
for
the
hero
on
the
horse
the
restorer
of
her
orchid
if
she
met
him
should
she
bow
to
him
or
pretend
not
to
see
him
she
had
practised
various
expressions
before
the
glass
and
had
almost
decided
to
look
up
as
he
passed
and
flash
a
glance
of
puzzled
recognition
from
her
eyes
she
thought
she
could
do
it
satisfactorily
and
she
meant
to
cross
the
bridge
for
the
first
time
he
had
been
riding
over
the
bridge
that
afternoon
and
what
had
happened
once
might
happen
again
moreover
she
had
a
feeling
that
across
the
water
there
was
something
waiting
for
her
certainly
behind
the
trees
clothing
the
gorge
there
was
the
real
country
with
cows
and
sheep
and
horses
in
the
meadows
with
the
possibility
of
rabbits
in
the
lanes
and
she
had
never
yet
seen
a
rabbit
running
wild
there
were
innumerable
possibilities
on
that
farther
side
she
crossed
the
bridge
stood
to
look
up
and
down
the
river
to
watch
the
gulls
white
against
the
green
to
consider
the
hurrying
of
the
people
on
the
road
below
and
the
clustered
houses
on
the
city
side
a
medley
of
shapes
and
colours
rising
in
terraces
the
whole
like
some
immense
castle
guarding
the
entrance
to
the
town
and
as
before
carriages
and
carts
went
and
came
over
schoolgirls
on
bicycles
babies
in
perambulators
but
this
time
there
was
no
man
on
a
horse
she
knew
that
this
mattered
very
little
her
stimulated
excitement
was
hardly
more
than
salt
and
pepper
to
a
dish
already
appetizing
enough
and
now
and
then
as
she
went
along
the
road
on
a
level
with
the
in
the
gorge
and
had
glimpses
of
water
and
of
rock
she
had
to
remind
herself
of
her
preoccupation
she
passed
big
houses
with
their
flowery
gardens
and
then
suddenly
timorous
she
decided
not
to
go
too
far
afield
she
might
get
lost
she
might
meet
nasty
people
or
horned
beasts
a
little
path
on
her
right
hand
had
an
inviting
look
it
might
lead
her
down
through
the
trees
to
the
water
edge
it
was
all
strewn
and
richly
brown
with
last
autumn
leaves
and
on
a
tree
a
few
yards
ahead
she
saw
a
brilliant
object
tiny
extraordinarily
swift
it
was
out
of
sight
before
she
had
time
to
tell
herself
that
this
was
a
squirrel
and
again
she
had
a
consciousness
of
development
she
had
seen
a
squirrel
in
its
native
haunts
this
was
wonderful
and
she
approached
the
tree
the
squirrel
had
vanished
but
these
woods
within
sound
of
a
city
yet
harbouring
squirrels
seemed
to
have
become
one
of
her
possessions
she
was
enriched
she
was
a
different
person
and
she
whose
familiar
fauna
had
been
stray
cats
and
the
black
beetles
in
banks
kitchen
was
actually
in
touch
with
nature
she
now
felt
equal
to
meeting
unattended
cows
but
the
woods
offered
enough
excitement
for
she
found
that
her
path
did
not
immediately
descend
it
led
her
levelly
to
an
almost
circular
green
space
then
it
became
enclosed
again
and
soft
to
the
feet
with
grass
and
just
ahead
of
her
blocking
her
way
she
saw
two
figures
those
of
a
woman
and
a
man
their
backs
were
towards
her
but
there
was
no
mistaking
aunt
rose
back
it
was
straight
without
being
stiff
her
dress
fell
with
a
unique
perfection
and
the
little
hat
and
grey
floating
veil
were
hers
alone
for
an
instant
henrietta
stood
still
and
the
man
turning
to
look
at
his
companion
showed
the
profile
of
her
stranger
at
the
same
moment
he
touched
aunt
rose
hand
and
before
henrietta
swerved
and
sped
back
whence
she
had
come
she
saw
that
hand
removed
gently
as
though
reluctantly
and
the
head
mistily
veiled
shaken
slowly
her
first
desire
was
for
flight
and
safely
on
the
road
again
she
found
her
heart
beating
to
suffocation
she
was
filled
with
an
indignation
that
almost
brought
her
to
tears
it
was
as
though
aunt
rose
had
deliberately
robbed
her
of
treasure
aunt
rose
who
was
almost
for
a
moment
she
despised
that
fair
handsome
man
whose
image
had
filled
her
mind
for
what
seemed
a
long
long
time
then
she
felt
pity
for
him
who
had
no
eyes
for
youth
yet
she
remembered
his
look
of
arrested
interest
but
steadying
her
thoughts
and
enjoying
her
dramatic
bitterness
she
laughed
he
had
merely
surprised
her
likeness
to
aunt
rose
and
that
was
all
her
dream
was
over
she
had
known
it
was
a
dream
but
the
awakening
was
cruel
it
was
also
intensely
exciting
she
did
not
regret
it
she
had
at
least
discovered
something
about
aunt
rose
she
had
a
lover
that
look
of
his
that
pleading
movement
of
his
hand
were
unmistakable
he
was
a
lover
and
perhaps
she
henrietta
mallett
alone
knew
the
truth
she
had
suspected
a
secret
now
she
knew
it
and
she
had
a
sense
of
power
she
had
a
weapon
she
imagined
herself
standing
over
aunt
rose
armed
with
knowledge
no
longer
afraid
she
was
involved
in
a
romantic
perhaps
a
shameful
situation
aunt
rose
was
meeting
a
lover
clandestinely
in
the
woods
while
aunt
caroline
and
aunt
sophia
sat
innocently
at
home
marvelling
at
rose
indifference
to
men
yet
rejoicing
in
her
spinsterhood
and
henrietta
felt
that
rose
had
wronged
her
stepsisters
almost
as
much
as
she
had
wronged
her
niece
she
was
deceitful
that
in
plain
terms
accounted
for
what
had
seemed
a
mysterious
and
conquered
sorrow
it
was
henrietta
who
was
to
suffer
through
the
shattering
of
a
dream
she
went
home
walking
quickly
but
feeling
that
she
groped
in
a
fog
broken
here
and
there
by
lurid
lights
the
lights
of
knowledge
and
determination
she
was
younger
than
aunt
rose
she
was
as
pretty
and
she
was
the
daughter
of
reginald
mallett
who
though
she
did
not
know
it
had
always
wanted
the
things
desired
by
other
people
she
could
continue
to
love
her
stranger
and
at
the
back
of
her
mind
was
the
unacknowledged
conviction
that
aunt
rose
choice
must
be
well
worth
loving
and
again
how
strangely
events
seemed
to
serve
her
first
the
dropping
of
an
orchid
and
now
the
leaping
of
a
squirrel
she
felt
herself
in
the
hands
of
higher
powers
she
had
a
feverish
longing
to
see
rose
again
to
see
her
plainly
for
the
first
time
and
dressing
for
dinner
was
like
preparing
for
a
great
event
yet
when
came
everything
was
surprisingly
the
same
the
deceived
caroline
and
sophia
ate
with
the
usual
appetite
susan
hovered
with
the
same
quiet
attention
and
rose
showed
no
sign
of
a
recent
interview
with
a
lover
across
the
candlelight
she
looked
at
henrietta
kindly
and
henrietta
remembered
the
three
thousand
pounds
she
did
not
want
to
remember
them
they
constituted
an
obligation
towards
this
woman
who
did
not
sufficiently
appreciate
her
who
met
that
man
secretly
in
a
wood
who
was
beautiful
with
a
kind
of
beauty
like
that
of
the
stars
and
while
these
angry
thoughts
passed
through
henrietta
mind
rose
tender
expression
had
developed
into
a
smile
and
she
asked
you
have
a
nice
walk
henrietta
gulped
she
looked
steadily
at
rose
and
on
her
lips
certain
words
began
to
form
themselves
but
she
did
not
utter
them
and
instead
of
saying
as
she
intended
i
went
across
the
bridge
and
into
those
woods
on
the
other
side
she
merely
said
yes
thank
you
and
smiled
back
it
had
been
impossible
not
to
smile
and
she
was
angry
with
aunt
rose
for
making
her
a
hypocrite
perhaps
she
had
smiled
like
that
in
the
wood
and
she
did
not
look
so
very
old
even
the
flames
of
the
candles
throwing
her
face
into
strong
relief
as
she
leaned
forward
did
not
reveal
any
lines
walk
too
much
child
caroline
said
enlarges
the
feet
girls
nowadays
can
wear
their
brothers
shoes
and
men
do
like
that
have
i
ever
told
you
caroline
was
given
to
repetition
of
her
stories
one
of
my
partners
ridiculous
creature
insisted
on
calling
me
cinderella
for
a
whole
evening
do
you
remember
sophia
dear
sophia
said
and
she
determined
that
some
day
when
she
was
alone
with
henrietta
she
would
tell
her
that
she
too
had
been
called
cinderella
that
night
it
was
hard
but
since
she
loved
her
sister
not
so
very
hard
to
ignore
her
own
little
triumphs
yet
she
would
like
henrietta
to
know
of
them
child
she
murmured
vaguely
have
our
shoes
made
for
us
caroline
went
on
necessary
she
snorted
scorn
for
a
generation
rose
laughed
she
said
as
much
as
you
like
henrietta
health
is
better
than
tiny
feet
henrietta
had
no
response
for
this
remark
for
the
first
time
she
felt
out
of
sympathy
with
her
surroundings
and
her
resentment
against
rose
spread
to
her
other
aunts
they
were
foolish
in
their
talk
of
men
and
little
feet
they
knew
for
all
their
worldliness
nothing
about
life
they
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
insufficiently
fed
or
clothed
they
had
never
battled
with
black
beetles
and
mutton
bones
their
white
hands
had
never
been
soiled
by
greasy
water
and
potato
skins
and
she
felt
a
bitterness
against
them
all
rose
what
do
you
know
about
it
caroline
asked
a
nun
that
what
you
are
lovely
sophia
sighed
but
henrietta
thinking
of
that
man
in
the
wood
raised
her
dark
eyebrows
sceptically
rubbish
a
nun
and
the
first
in
the
family
all
our
women
caroline
turned
to
henrietta
broken
hearts
they
ca
help
it
it
in
the
blood
you
do
it
yourself
all
except
rose
and
our
men
she
guffawed
even
the
general
but
if
i
tell
you
about
our
men
sophia
will
be
shocked
men
henrietta
straightened
herself
and
looked
round
the
table
her
dark
eyes
shone
and
the
anger
she
was
powerless
to
display
against
aunt
rose
the
remembrance
of
her
own
and
her
struggles
found
an
outlet
ca
tell
me
anything
i
do
know
i
do
think
it
is
funny
have
i
suffered
through
one
of
them
my
father
he
was
anything
to
boast
about
sophia
said
gently
and
caroline
uttered
a
stern
are
you
saying
do
care
henrietta
said
you
proud
of
all
the
harm
he
did
but
my
mother
and
i
had
to
bear
it
he
was
weak
and
selfish
we
nearly
starved
but
he
did
oh
no
he
did
with
her
hands
clasped
tightly
on
her
knee
she
bent
over
the
table
and
her
head
was
lowered
with
the
effect
of
some
small
animal
prepared
for
a
spring
you
know
she
said
wore
silk
shirts
silk
shirts
and
i
had
only
one
set
of
underclothing
in
the
world
i
had
to
wash
them
overnight
that
was
my
father
a
mallett
were
they
all
like
that
there
was
silence
until
caroline
peeling
an
apple
with
trembling
fingers
said
severely
do
think
we
need
continue
this
conversation
her
indignation
was
beyond
mere
words
she
was
outraged
her
brother
had
been
insulted
by
this
child
who
owed
his
sisters
gratitude
the
family
had
been
held
up
to
scorn
and
henrietta
aware
of
what
she
had
done
and
of
her
obligations
was
overwhelmed
with
regret
with
confusion
with
the
sense
that
after
all
it
was
she
who
really
loved
and
understood
her
father
will
excuse
you
henrietta
if
you
have
finished
your
dessert
caroline
said
she
had
a
great
dignity
this
was
a
dismissal
and
henrietta
stood
up
she
could
not
take
back
her
words
for
they
were
true
she
did
not
know
how
to
apologize
for
their
manner
she
felt
she
would
have
to
leave
the
house
and
she
had
a
sudden
pride
in
aunt
caroline
and
in
her
own
name
but
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
most
unexpectedly
rose
intervened
must
forgive
bitterness
she
said
quietly
is
natural
her
own
father
sophia
remonstrated
tearfully
and
added
tenderly
poor
child
henrietta
dropped
into
her
chair
she
wept
without
concealment
is
that
i
did
love
him
she
sobbed
yes
you
loved
him
sophia
said
did
we
she
dabbed
her
face
with
her
lace
handkerchief
is
rose
who
knows
nothing
about
him
she
said
with
something
approaching
anger
that
is
why
i
understand
rose
said
no
you
do
henrietta
cried
she
could
not
admit
that
she
would
not
allow
aunt
rose
to
make
such
a
claim
she
looked
from
caroline
to
sophia
we
who
know
she
said
yes
it
was
they
three
who
were
banded
together
in
love
for
reginald
mallett
in
their
sympathy
for
each
other
in
the
greater
nearness
of
their
relationship
to
the
person
in
dispute
she
looked
up
and
she
saw
through
her
tears
a
slight
quiver
pass
over
the
face
of
rose
and
she
knew
she
had
hurt
her
and
she
was
glad
of
it
must
forgive
me
she
said
to
caroline
well
he
was
a
wretch
a
great
wretch
a
great
dear
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
it
was
rose
now
who
was
in
disgrace
and
it
was
henrietta
caroline
and
sophia
who
passed
an
evening
of
excessive
amiability
in
the
henrietta
felt
heroically
that
she
had
thrown
down
her
glove
and
it
was
annoying
the
next
morning
to
find
rose
would
not
pick
it
up
she
remained
charming
she
was
inimitably
calm
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
offence
of
the
night
before
and
henrietta
delighted
in
the
thought
that
though
rose
did
not
know
it
she
and
henrietta
were
rivals
in
love
and
she
told
herself
that
her
own
time
would
come
she
had
only
to
wait
she
was
a
great
believer
in
her
own
luck
and
had
not
aunt
caroline
assured
her
that
all
the
mallett
women
were
born
to
break
hearts
all
but
aunt
rose
some
day
she
was
bound
to
meet
that
man
again
and
looking
in
the
glass
after
the
mallett
manner
she
was
pleased
with
what
she
saw
there
she
was
her
father
daughter
her
father
had
never
denied
himself
anything
he
wanted
and
since
her
outbreak
against
him
she
felt
closer
to
him
she
was
prepared
to
condone
his
sins
even
to
emulate
them
and
find
in
him
her
excuse
she
looked
at
the
portrait
on
the
wall
she
kissed
her
hand
to
it
somehow
he
seemed
to
be
helping
her
but
with
all
her
carefully
nurtured
enmity
she
could
not
deny
her
admiration
for
aunt
rose
she
was
proud
to
sit
beside
her
in
the
carriage
which
took
them
to
sales
hall
and
on
that
occasion
rose
talked
more
than
usual
telling
henrietta
little
stories
of
the
people
living
in
the
houses
they
passed
and
little
anecdotes
of
her
own
childhood
connected
with
the
fields
and
lanes
henrietta
sighed
suddenly
must
be
nice
she
said
be
part
of
a
place
you
ca
be
part
of
london
in
with
no
friends
i
should
love
to
have
had
a
tree
for
a
friend
all
my
life
it
sounds
silly
but
it
would
make
me
feel
different
she
was
angry
with
herself
for
saying
this
to
aunt
rose
but
again
she
could
not
help
it
she
saw
too
much
with
her
eyes
and
aunt
rose
pleased
them
and
she
assured
herself
that
though
these
softened
her
heart
and
loosened
her
tongue
she
could
resume
her
reserve
at
her
leisure
was
a
tree
a
cherry
in
one
of
the
gardens
once
but
we
did
stay
there
long
we
had
to
go
she
added
quickly
was
too
expensive
for
us
i
suppose
they
charged
for
the
tree
but
i
did
long
to
see
it
blossom
and
this
spring
she
waved
a
hand
seen
hundreds
i
seen
a
squirrel
she
stopped
little
things
rose
said
they
were
jogging
alongside
the
high
bare
wall
she
hated
and
the
big
trees
casting
their
high
wide
branches
far
above
and
beyond
it
seemed
to
be
stretching
out
to
the
sea
and
the
hills
you
seen
one
lately
henrietta
asked
a
squirrel
no
not
lately
they
shy
one
does
see
them
often
then
i
was
lucky
henrietta
said
saw
one
in
those
woods
we
just
passed
the
other
day
she
looked
at
her
aunt
creamy
cheek
there
was
no
flush
on
it
her
profile
was
serene
the
dark
lashes
did
not
stir
rose
said
will
see
hills
and
the
channel
when
shall
we
come
to
mrs
sales
house
is
she
an
old
lady
do
think
you
would
call
her
very
old
she
is
younger
than
i
am
that
not
old
henrietta
said
kindly
she
any
children
there
a
cat
and
a
dog
especially
a
cat
a
husband
i
suppose
a
husband
do
you
like
cats
henrietta
catch
mice
henrietta
said
informatively
do
think
this
one
has
ever
caught
a
mouse
but
it
lies
in
wait
for
something
cats
are
horrible
they
listen
and
she
added
as
though
to
herself
frighten
me
more
afraid
of
dogs
henrietta
said
but
you
must
be
henrietta
dared
afraid
of
cats
know
but
dogs
they
seem
to
be
part
of
one
inheritance
dogs
and
horses
the
horses
i
known
henrietta
said
with
her
odd
bitterness
been
in
cabs
and
even
then
i
never
knew
them
well
sales
must
show
you
his
rose
said
are
the
hills
now
we
turn
to
the
left
but
down
that
track
and
across
the
fields
is
the
short
cut
to
sales
hall
one
can
ride
that
way
should
like
to
see
the
dairy
henrietta
remarked
do
they
pretend
they
have
one
rose
smiled
they
very
proud
of
it
it
a
model
dairy
no
doubt
francis
will
be
glad
to
show
you
that
too
and
here
we
are
the
masculine
hall
with
its
smell
of
tobacco
leather
and
tweed
the
low
winding
staircase
covered
with
matting
its
walls
adorned
with
sporting
prints
was
a
strange
introduction
to
the
room
in
which
henrietta
found
herself
she
had
an
impression
of
richness
and
colour
the
carpet
was
very
soft
the
hangings
were
of
silk
a
fire
burned
in
the
grate
though
the
day
was
warm
and
before
the
fire
lay
the
cat
the
dog
was
on
the
looking
out
at
the
glorious
world
full
of
smells
and
rabbits
which
he
loved
and
which
he
denied
himself
for
the
greater
part
of
each
day
because
he
loved
his
mistress
more
but
he
jumped
down
to
greet
rose
with
a
great
wagging
of
his
tail
she
stooped
to
him
saying
is
henrietta
christabel
henrietta
this
is
mrs
sales
the
woman
on
the
couch
looked
to
henrietta
like
a
doll
animated
by
some
diabolically
clever
mechanism
she
was
so
pink
and
blue
and
fair
she
was
in
fact
a
child
idea
of
feminine
beauty
and
henrietta
felt
a
rush
of
sorrow
that
she
should
have
to
lie
there
day
after
day
watching
the
seasons
come
and
go
it
was
marvellous
that
she
had
courage
enough
to
smile
and
she
said
at
once
mallett
is
always
trying
to
give
me
pleasure
and
her
tone
her
glance
at
rose
startled
henrietta
as
much
as
if
the
little
thin
hand
outside
the
coverlet
had
suddenly
produced
a
glittering
toy
which
had
its
uses
as
a
dagger
she
too
looked
at
rose
but
rose
was
talking
to
the
dog
and
it
was
then
that
henrietta
became
really
aware
of
the
cat
it
was
certainly
listening
it
had
stretched
out
its
and
revealed
shining
claws
and
those
polished
instruments
seemed
to
match
the
words
which
still
floated
on
the
warm
air
of
the
room
now
she
has
brought
you
christabel
went
on
was
kind
of
you
to
come
do
sit
here
beside
me
tell
me
what
you
think
of
rose
tell
me
what
you
think
she
laughed
your
aunt
she
beautiful
she
very
henrietta
said
and
she
spoke
coldly
because
she
too
was
a
mallett
and
she
suspected
this
praise
uttered
in
rose
hearing
and
still
with
that
sharpness
as
of
knives
she
had
never
been
in
a
room
in
which
she
felt
less
at
ease
perhaps
she
had
been
prejudiced
by
aunt
rose
words
about
the
cat
but
that
seemed
absurd
and
she
was
confused
by
her
vague
feelings
of
anger
and
pity
and
suspicion
however
she
did
her
best
to
be
a
pleasant
guest
she
had
somehow
to
break
the
tenseness
in
the
room
and
she
called
on
her
reserve
of
anecdote
she
told
the
story
of
jenkins
trying
to
fetch
his
boots
and
catch
a
glimpse
of
banks
daily
help
who
could
cook
but
had
no
character
she
described
the
stickiness
of
his
collar
and
because
she
was
always
readily
responsive
to
her
surroundings
she
found
it
natural
to
be
humorous
in
a
somewhat
spiteful
way
and
at
a
casual
mention
of
the
battys
she
became
amusing
at
the
expense
of
charles
and
felt
a
slight
regret
when
she
had
roused
christabel
laughter
it
seemed
unkind
he
had
confided
in
her
she
had
betrayed
him
and
rose
completed
her
discomfiture
by
saying
do
laugh
at
poor
charles
he
feels
too
much
christabel
nodded
her
head
aunt
is
very
sympathetic
she
understands
men
she
added
quickly
you
met
my
husband
henrietta
said
only
seen
your
carts
the
two
women
laughed
and
it
was
strange
to
hear
them
united
in
that
mirth
henrietta
looked
puzzled
she
explained
was
one
of
the
first
things
i
noticed
it
stuck
in
my
head
naturally
the
impressions
of
that
day
had
been
unusually
vivid
and
she
saw
with
painful
clearness
the
figure
of
the
man
on
the
horse
as
enduring
as
though
it
had
been
executed
in
bronze
yet
animated
by
ardent
life
christabel
said
are
to
have
tea
with
the
owner
of
the
carts
rose
has
tea
with
him
every
time
she
comes
it
part
of
the
ceremony
she
sighed
wearily
the
cat
moved
an
ear
the
nurse
entered
as
a
signal
that
the
visitors
must
depart
come
again
you
christabel
asked
holding
henrietta
hand
and
as
rose
said
a
few
words
to
the
nurse
she
whispered
alone
and
surprisingly
from
the
hearthrug
there
was
a
loud
purring
from
the
cat
it
was
like
release
to
be
in
the
matted
corridor
again
and
it
was
in
silence
that
rose
led
the
way
downstairs
henrietta
followed
slowly
looking
at
the
pictures
of
hounds
in
full
cry
ladies
taking
fences
airily
gentlemen
immersed
in
brooks
but
at
the
turn
of
the
stairs
she
stood
she
had
the
physical
sensation
of
her
heart
leaving
its
place
and
lodging
in
her
throat
her
stranger
was
standing
in
the
hall
he
was
looking
at
aunt
rose
and
she
knew
now
what
expression
he
was
wearing
in
the
wood
he
was
looking
at
her
and
as
though
he
were
suffering
from
hunger
she
could
not
see
her
aunt
face
but
when
henrietta
stood
beside
her
rose
turned
saying
let
me
introduce
mr
sales
he
said
do
you
do
and
then
she
saw
again
that
look
of
interest
with
which
she
seemed
to
have
been
familiar
for
so
long
think
i
have
seen
you
before
he
said
was
you
who
picked
up
my
orchid
course
he
looked
from
her
to
rose
could
think
who
you
reminded
me
of
but
now
i
know
do
think
we
are
very
much
alike
henrietta
said
rose
laughed
do
say
that
i
have
been
glad
to
think
we
are
might
be
sisters
said
francis
sales
this
little
scene
being
played
so
easily
and
lightly
by
this
man
and
woman
had
a
nightmare
quality
for
henrietta
it
had
the
confusion
the
exaggerated
horror
of
an
evil
dream
without
the
consciousness
of
its
unreality
here
she
was
in
the
presence
of
the
man
she
loved
and
it
was
wicked
to
love
him
she
had
longed
to
meet
him
and
now
she
wished
she
might
have
kept
his
memory
only
the
figure
on
the
horse
the
man
with
the
pink
orchid
in
his
hand
she
had
suspected
her
aunt
rose
of
a
secret
love
affair
she
had
now
discovered
her
guilty
of
sin
the
evidence
was
slight
but
conviction
was
tremendous
she
was
horrified
but
she
was
also
elated
this
was
drama
this
was
life
she
was
herself
a
romantic
figure
she
was
robbed
of
her
happiness
her
youth
was
blighted
the
woman
upstairs
was
wronged
and
henrietta
understood
why
there
were
knives
on
her
tongue
she
understood
the
watchfulness
of
the
cat
yet
as
they
sat
in
the
cool
with
its
pale
flowery
chintz
its
primrose
curtains
the
faded
on
the
walls
and
aunt
rose
pouring
tea
into
the
flowered
cups
she
might
if
she
had
wished
have
been
persuaded
that
she
was
wrong
perhaps
she
had
mistaken
that
angry
starving
look
in
the
man
eyes
it
had
gone
nothing
could
have
been
more
ordinary
than
his
expression
and
his
conversation
but
she
knew
she
was
not
wrong
and
she
sat
there
on
the
alert
losing
not
a
glance
not
a
tone
her
limbs
were
trembling
she
could
not
eat
and
she
was
astonished
that
aunt
rose
could
nibble
biscuits
with
such
nonchalance
that
francis
sales
could
eat
plum
cake
he
was
without
doubt
the
most
attractive
man
she
had
ever
seen
his
long
brown
fingers
fascinated
her
and
again
she
wondered
at
the
odd
sequence
of
events
she
had
seen
his
name
on
the
carts
she
had
seen
him
on
the
horse
he
had
picked
up
her
pink
orchid
she
had
been
led
by
fate
and
a
squirrel
into
the
wood
and
now
she
found
him
here
it
was
like
a
play
and
it
would
be
still
more
like
a
play
if
she
snatched
him
from
aunt
rose
in
that
idea
there
was
the
prompting
of
her
father
but
her
mother
part
in
her
was
a
reminder
that
she
must
not
snatch
him
for
herself
no
only
out
of
danger
men
were
helpless
they
were
like
babies
in
the
hands
of
women
and
hands
could
differ
they
could
hurt
or
soothe
and
she
imagined
her
own
performing
the
latter
task
she
saw
it
as
her
mission
and
on
the
way
home
she
told
herself
that
her
silence
was
not
that
of
anger
but
of
dedication
she
thought
aunt
rose
looked
at
her
rather
curiously
though
there
was
no
expression
so
definite
in
that
glance
her
aunts
did
not
ask
questions
they
never
interfered
and
if
henrietta
chose
to
be
silent
it
was
her
own
affair
she
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
swimming
in
a
warm
bath
of
emotion
and
she
experienced
the
usual
chill
when
she
descended
from
the
carriage
and
felt
the
pavement
under
her
feet
she
had
dedicated
herself
to
a
high
purpose
but
for
the
moment
it
was
impossible
to
get
on
with
the
noble
work
the
mere
business
of
life
had
to
be
proceeded
with
and
though
the
situation
was
absorbing
it
receded
now
and
then
until
looking
at
her
aunt
rose
she
was
reminded
of
it
with
a
shock
she
looked
often
at
her
aunt
finding
her
more
than
ever
fascinating
she
tried
to
see
her
with
the
eyes
of
francis
sales
she
tried
to
imagine
how
rose
clear
grey
eyes
so
dark
sometimes
that
they
seemed
black
answered
the
appeal
of
his
yet
as
the
days
passed
henrietta
found
it
difficult
to
remember
her
resignation
and
her
wrongs
in
this
new
life
of
luxury
and
pleasure
she
woke
each
morning
to
the
thought
of
gaiety
and
to
the
realization
of
comfort
and
the
blessed
absence
of
anxiety
her
occupation
was
the
getting
of
enjoyment
and
she
took
it
all
eagerly
yet
without
greed
and
as
she
was
enriched
she
became
generous
with
her
own
offerings
of
laughter
sympathy
and
affection
she
liked
and
looked
for
the
brightening
of
caroline
and
sophia
at
her
approach
she
became
pleasantly
aware
of
her
own
ability
to
charm
and
she
rejoiced
in
an
exterior
world
no
longer
limited
to
streets
each
morning
she
went
to
her
window
and
looked
over
and
beyond
the
roofs
so
beautiful
and
varied
in
themselves
to
the
trees
screening
the
open
country
across
the
river
and
if
the
sight
reminded
her
to
sigh
for
her
own
sorrows
and
to
think
bitterly
of
aunt
rose
she
had
not
time
to
linger
on
her
emotions
summer
was
gay
in
upper
radstowe
there
were
and
picnics
she
paid
calls
with
her
aunts
and
learnt
to
play
lawn
tennis
with
her
contemporaries
her
friendship
with
the
battys
ripened
she
was
always
sure
of
her
welcome
at
prospect
house
and
though
she
often
assured
herself
that
she
could
love
no
one
but
francis
sales
that
was
no
reason
why
others
should
not
love
her
from
that
point
of
view
john
batty
was
a
failure
he
took
her
to
a
cricket
match
but
finding
that
she
did
not
know
the
alphabet
of
the
game
and
was
more
interested
in
the
spectators
than
in
the
players
he
gave
her
up
he
admired
her
appearance
but
it
did
not
make
amends
for
ignorance
of
such
a
grossness
and
equally
displeased
with
him
she
returned
home
alone
while
he
watched
out
the
match
the
next
day
when
she
paid
her
usual
sunday
visit
she
ignored
him
pointedly
and
mentally
crossed
him
off
her
list
charles
ugly
and
odd
was
infinitely
more
responsive
though
he
greeted
her
on
this
occasion
with
reproach
went
to
a
cricket
match
yesterday
with
john
was
very
boring
and
i
got
a
headache
i
shall
never
go
again
said
he
would
take
you
henrietta
smiled
subtly
implying
a
good
deal
should
have
thought
charles
went
on
mournfully
suggesting
such
a
thing
aunts
were
rather
shocked
i
went
on
the
top
of
a
tramcar
with
him
if
you
can
go
out
with
him
why
should
you
go
out
with
me
where
henrietta
questioned
practically
to
a
concert
there
is
one
i
do
know
they
wo
have
one
in
this
place
until
the
autumn
a
long
time
ahead
he
spread
his
hands
see
i
never
have
any
luck
i
just
want
you
to
promise
i
promise
henrietta
said
will
be
the
first
time
i
been
anywhere
with
a
girl
he
said
do
get
on
you
wanted
to
he
sighed
but
not
much
her
laughter
which
was
so
pretty
startled
him
it
also
delighted
him
with
its
music
and
his
sad
eyes
grew
wider
and
more
vague
he
had
an
inspiration
take
you
home
now
not
going
home
i
promised
to
go
to
sales
hall
hall
oh
yes
he
the
man
who
talks
at
concerts
when
he
goes
i
know
him
have
you
ever
wanted
to
murder
anyone
i
wanted
to
murder
him
i
might
some
day
you
better
warn
him
was
this
another
strand
in
the
web
of
her
drama
she
wondered
was
aunt
rose
involved
in
this
too
she
breathed
quickly
what
has
he
done
to
you
he
ground
his
teeth
looking
terrible
but
ineffectual
beauty
that
what
his
sort
does
he
kills
lovely
things
that
fly
and
run
for
sport
and
he
steals
beauty
spoils
it
she
whispered
man
sales
no
who
has
he
stolen
and
spoilt
music
and
my
happiness
i
lost
a
bar
a
whole
bar
i
tell
you
i
never
forgive
him
i
ca
get
it
back
that
all
henrietta
gestured
there
are
others
charles
went
on
never
forget
them
i
meet
them
in
the
streets
and
they
look
horrible
like
beetles
believe
you
mad
henrietta
said
earnestly
not
sense
is
sense
henrietta
could
not
tell
him
she
looked
at
him
a
little
afraid
but
excited
by
this
proximity
to
danger
and
i
thought
you
would
understand
course
i
do
she
could
not
bear
to
let
go
of
anything
which
might
do
her
credit
do
but
you
exaggerate
and
mr
sales
she
hesitated
and
in
doing
so
she
remembered
to
be
angry
with
charles
batty
for
maligning
him
can
you
judge
mr
sales
she
asked
with
scorn
is
a
man
what
am
i
charles
demanded
queer
she
said
his
face
twisted
curiously
suppose
if
i
shot
things
and
chased
them
you
like
me
better
but
i
ca
not
even
for
that
but
perhaps
some
day
he
seemed
to
lose
himself
in
the
vagueness
of
his
thoughts
she
finished
his
sentence
gaily
for
after
all
it
was
absurd
to
quarrel
with
him
day
we
go
to
a
concert
he
recovered
himself
than
that
he
said
he
nodded
his
head
with
unexpected
vigour
see
she
gazed
at
him
it
was
wonderful
to
think
of
all
the
things
that
might
happen
to
a
person
who
was
only
but
she
hastily
corrected
her
thoughts
what
could
happen
to
her
in
a
few
short
days
events
had
rushed
together
and
exhausted
themselves
at
their
source
there
was
nothing
left
she
said
to
charles
and
thought
him
foolish
not
to
offer
to
accompany
her
she
said
a
very
long
way
to
sales
hall
and
he
answered
you
meet
that
man
somewhere
potting
at
rabbits
you
think
so
i
hope
he
wo
shoot
me
and
she
saw
herself
stretched
on
the
ground
wounded
dying
with
just
enough
force
to
utter
words
he
could
never
forget
words
that
would
change
his
whole
life
she
was
willing
to
sacrifice
herself
and
she
said
to
charles
again
and
sorrowfully
as
though
she
were
already
dead
she
tried
to
plan
her
dying
words
but
as
she
could
not
hit
on
satisfactory
ones
she
contented
herself
with
deciding
that
whether
she
were
wounded
or
not
she
would
try
to
introduce
the
subject
of
aunt
rose
and
as
she
went
she
looked
out
hopefully
for
a
tall
figure
with
a
gun
under
its
arm
she
met
it
but
without
a
gun
on
the
track
where
on
one
side
the
trees
stood
in
fresh
green
like
banners
and
on
the
other
the
meadows
sloped
roughly
to
the
distant
water
he
had
been
watching
for
her
he
said
and
suddenly
over
her
assurance
there
swept
a
wave
of
embarrassment
of
shyness
she
was
alone
with
him
and
he
was
not
like
charles
batty
he
looked
down
at
her
with
amusement
in
his
blue
eyes
and
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
here
was
the
hero
or
the
villain
of
the
piece
she
felt
the
sensation
she
had
known
when
he
handed
her
the
orchid
and
she
blushed
absurdly
when
he
actually
said
as
though
he
read
her
thoughts
orchids
she
laughed
up
at
him
was
a
special
treat
i
did
see
batty
this
afternoon
and
he
could
afford
to
give
them
away
every
sunday
you
go
there
every
sunday
they
very
kind
would
be
this
reminded
her
a
little
of
jenkins
though
she
cast
the
idea
from
her
quickly
jenkins
was
not
worthy
of
sharing
a
thought
with
francis
sales
his
collar
was
made
of
rubber
his
accent
was
grotesque
but
the
influence
of
the
was
still
on
her
when
she
asked
very
innocently
i
need
tell
you
that
it
was
jenkins
again
but
in
a
voice
that
was
soft
almost
caressing
did
mr
sales
talk
like
this
to
aunt
rose
she
could
not
believe
it
and
she
was
both
flattered
and
distressed
she
must
assert
her
dignity
and
she
had
no
way
of
doing
it
but
by
an
expression
of
firmness
a
slight
tightening
of
lips
that
wanted
to
twitch
into
a
smile
charles
batty
the
voice
went
on
to
have
missed
his
opportunities
but
i
have
always
suspected
him
of
idiocy
do
know
what
you
mean
she
said
untruthfully
and
then
loyally
she
protested
he
not
an
idiot
he
very
clever
too
clever
not
like
other
people
there
are
different
names
for
that
sort
of
thing
he
said
easily
and
she
was
aware
of
an
immense
distance
between
her
and
him
he
seemed
to
have
put
her
from
him
with
a
light
push
and
at
the
same
time
she
was
oppressively
conscious
of
his
nearness
she
felt
angry
and
she
burst
out
wo
have
you
speaking
like
that
about
charles
not
if
he
a
friend
of
yours
i
wo
have
you
laughing
at
me
he
stopped
in
his
long
stride
you
laugh
yourself
at
the
things
that
please
you
very
much
do
she
begged
he
was
too
much
for
her
she
was
helpless
as
though
she
had
been
drugged
to
a
point
when
she
could
move
and
think
but
only
through
a
mist
and
she
felt
that
his
ease
approaching
impudence
was
as
indecent
as
aunt
rose
calm
it
was
both
irritating
and
pleasing
to
know
that
she
could
have
shattered
both
with
the
word
she
was
incapable
of
saying
but
her
nearest
approach
to
that
was
an
inquiry
after
the
health
of
mrs
sales
he
replied
that
she
was
looking
forward
to
henrietta
visit
she
had
very
few
pleasures
and
was
always
glad
to
see
people
rose
here
was
an
opportunity
does
she
every
week
he
said
he
believed
so
you
know
her
when
she
was
a
little
girl
he
gave
a
discouraging
affirmative
was
she
like
do
know
he
had
indeed
forgotten
you
must
remember
her
when
she
was
young
henrietta
nodded
bravely
though
he
seemed
to
smoulder
young
as
i
am
was
exactly
the
same
as
she
is
now
no
not
quite
what
a
word
nice
he
looked
all
round
him
and
made
a
flourish
with
his
stick
he
could
not
express
himself
yet
he
seemed
unable
to
be
silent
you
call
the
sky
nice
very
when
it
blue
he
gave
to
her
great
satisfaction
the
kind
of
laugh
she
had
expected
us
talk
about
something
a
little
smaller
than
the
sky
he
said
he
looked
down
at
her
and
she
was
relieved
to
see
the
anger
fading
from
his
face
but
she
was
glad
to
have
learnt
something
of
what
he
felt
for
aunt
rose
to
him
she
was
like
the
sky
whence
came
the
rain
and
the
sunshine
where
the
stars
shone
and
the
moon
and
she
wondered
to
what
he
would
have
compared
herself
said
we
might
be
sisters
he
looked
again
she
wore
a
broad
white
hat
in
honour
of
the
season
her
black
dress
was
dotted
with
white
from
one
capable
white
hand
she
swung
her
gloves
she
tilted
her
chin
a
trick
she
had
inherited
from
her
father
in
a
sort
of
challenge
like
the
idea
he
asked
do
believe
it
i
really
the
image
of
my
father
did
you
know
him
heard
of
him
of
course
him
i
like
henrietta
repeated
firmly
the
story
of
his
good
looks
must
be
true
mixed
with
her
pleasure
she
had
a
return
of
disappointment
here
was
jenkins
once
more
and
while
it
was
sad
to
discover
his
in
her
ideal
it
was
thrilling
to
resume
the
kind
of
fencing
she
thought
she
had
resigned
she
forgot
her
virtuous
resolves
and
the
remainder
of
the
walk
was
enlivened
by
the
hope
of
a
thrust
which
she
would
have
to
parry
but
none
came
francis
sales
seemed
to
have
exhausted
his
efforts
and
at
the
door
he
said
with
a
sort
of
sulkiness
think
you
had
better
go
up
alone
you
must
let
me
see
you
home
this
was
not
her
first
solitary
visit
to
christabel
sales
and
she
half
dreaded
half
enjoyed
meeting
the
glances
of
those
wide
blue
eyes
which
were
searching
behind
their
innocence
and
hearing
remarks
which
though
dropped
carelessly
always
gave
her
the
impression
of
being
tipped
with
steel
she
was
bewildered
troubled
by
her
sense
that
she
and
christabel
were
allies
and
yet
antagonists
and
her
jealousy
of
her
aunt
rose
fought
with
her
unwilling
loyalty
to
one
of
her
own
blood
there
were
moments
when
she
acquiesced
in
the
suggestions
offered
in
the
form
of
admiration
and
others
when
she
stiffened
with
distaste
with
a
realization
that
she
herself
was
liable
to
attack
with
horror
for
the
beautiful
luxurious
room
the
crippled
woman
the
listening
cat
henrietta
sometimes
saw
herself
as
a
mouse
in
mortal
danger
of
a
feline
spring
and
then
pity
for
christabel
would
overcome
this
weariness
she
would
talk
to
her
with
what
skill
she
had
for
entertainment
and
she
emerged
exhausted
as
though
from
a
fight
this
evening
she
was
amazed
to
be
received
without
any
greeting
but
a
question
rose
mallett
told
you
why
i
am
here
christabel
was
lying
very
low
on
her
couch
her
lips
hardly
moved
these
might
have
been
the
last
words
she
would
ever
utter
a
hunting
accident
and
you
told
me
about
it
yourself
there
was
a
silence
and
then
the
voice
its
sharpness
dulled
said
slowly
i
told
you
what
i
remembered
and
what
i
heard
afterwards
a
hunting
accident
it
sounds
so
simple
that
what
they
call
it
names
are
useful
we
could
get
on
without
them
i
get
such
queer
ideas
lying
here
with
nothing
to
do
before
i
was
married
i
never
thought
at
all
i
was
too
happy
she
seemed
to
be
lost
in
memory
of
that
time
henrietta
sat
very
still
she
breathed
carefully
as
though
a
brusqueness
would
be
fatal
and
the
voice
began
again
call
you
henrietta
it
only
a
name
but
it
does
describe
you
nobody
knows
what
it
means
except
you
but
it
convenient
the
same
with
my
hunting
accident
do
you
see
henrietta
said
nothing
she
had
that
familiar
feeling
of
being
in
the
dark
and
now
the
evening
shadows
augmented
it
she
was
conscious
of
the
cat
behind
her
on
the
hearthrug
you
see
christabel
persisted
have
to
be
called
something
henrietta
said
just
what
i
have
been
telling
you
and
so
rose
mallett
calls
it
a
hunting
accident
a
and
thin
laugh
came
from
the
pillows
was
terribly
distressed
about
it
and
she
actually
told
me
she
had
suspected
that
mare
from
the
first
she
told
me
funny
do
you
think
so
henrietta
said
stoutly
funny
at
all
she
spoke
in
a
very
firm
and
reasonable
voice
as
though
only
her
common
sense
could
combat
what
seemed
like
insanity
in
the
other
think
it
very
sad
me
oh
yes
but
i
was
thinking
of
that
i
was
thinking
of
your
charming
aunt
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
radstowe
that
what
i
have
heard
her
called
yet
why
has
she
married
ca
she
find
anybody
the
voice
was
gentle
love
her
she
suspected
that
mare
but
she
warned
nobody
funny
henrietta
had
a
physical
inward
trembling
she
felt
a
dreadful
rage
against
the
woman
on
the
couch
a
sickening
disgust
such
as
she
would
have
felt
at
looking
down
a
dark
deep
well
and
seeing
slime
and
blind
ugliness
at
the
bottom
she
felt
as
though
her
ears
were
dirty
she
tried
to
move
but
she
sat
perfectly
still
and
dreading
what
would
come
next
she
listened
fascinated
she
is
in
love
with
somebody
does
she
get
many
letters
henrietta
she
is
very
reserved
she
does
tell
me
much
but
of
course
i
interested
in
her
she
laughed
again
am
very
anxious
for
her
happiness
it
would
comfort
me
to
know
anything
you
can
tell
me
henrietta
managed
to
stand
up
know
nothing
she
said
in
a
slightly
broken
voice
do
want
to
know
anything
christabel
interrupted
smoothly
you
are
wise
or
you
stay
happily
in
that
house
they
all
like
witches
those
women
they
frighten
me
you
must
be
very
brave
henrietta
very
grateful
henrietta
said
i
sha
come
here
again
no
never
i
do
know
what
you
have
been
trying
to
tell
me
but
i
do
believe
it
it
no
good
crying
i
shall
never
come
back
they
not
witches
she
had
a
vision
of
them
at
the
dinner
table
rose
like
a
white
flower
caroline
and
sophia
jewelled
gaily
dressed
a
little
absurd
oddly
distinguished
they
are
my
sisters
and
i
love
them
but
you
do
know
rose
christabel
sobbed
do
say
you
will
never
come
again
and
do
tell
francis
he
would
be
angry
could
i
tell
him
henrietta
asked
indignantly
no
i
want
to
see
either
of
you
again
i
shall
go
away
go
away
she
left
the
room
to
the
sound
of
a
horrible
faint
weeping
she
meant
what
she
had
said
she
thought
she
would
go
away
from
radstowe
and
forget
christabel
sales
forget
francis
sales
whom
she
would
no
longer
pretend
to
love
forget
those
insinuations
that
aunt
rose
was
guilty
of
a
crime
this
place
and
these
people
were
abhorrent
to
her
she
felt
she
had
been
poisoned
and
she
rushed
down
the
long
avenue
where
overhead
the
rooks
were
calling
as
though
she
could
only
be
saved
by
the
clean
night
air
beyond
the
house
she
was
shocked
she
believed
that
christabel
was
mad
the
thought
of
that
warm
room
where
the
cat
listened
made
her
gasp
and
her
horror
extended
to
francis
sales
himself
the
place
felt
wicked
but
the
clear
road
stretching
before
her
the
pale
evening
sky
and
the
sound
of
her
own
feet
tapping
the
road
restored
her
she
was
glad
to
be
alone
and
avoiding
the
short
cut
she
enjoyed
the
sanity
of
the
highway
used
by
ordinary
men
and
women
in
the
decent
pursuit
of
their
lives
but
now
the
road
was
empty
and
though
at
another
time
she
would
have
been
afraid
of
the
lonely
country
she
had
a
sense
of
escape
from
greater
perils
than
any
lurking
here
and
before
long
it
all
seemed
like
a
dream
but
it
was
a
dream
that
might
recur
if
she
ran
the
risk
no
she
would
never
go
there
again
she
would
never
envy
aunt
rose
a
lover
from
that
house
she
would
never
believe
that
the
worst
of
christabel
implications
were
true
they
were
the
fabrications
of
a
suspicious
woman
and
though
her
jealousy
might
be
justified
it
seemed
to
henrietta
that
she
deserved
her
fate
she
was
hateful
she
was
poisonous
and
henrietta
felt
a
sudden
tenderness
for
aunt
rose
and
francis
sales
they
could
not
help
themselves
for
they
were
unfortunate
she
longed
to
show
them
sympathy
and
she
saw
herself
taking
them
by
the
hand
and
saying
gently
in
me
i
understand
she
imagined
aunt
rose
melting
at
that
touch
and
those
words
into
tears
perhaps
of
repentance
certainly
of
gratitude
but
at
this
point
henrietta
fancies
were
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
behind
her
she
quickened
her
pace
then
began
to
run
and
the
steps
followed
gaining
on
her
she
could
not
outrun
them
and
she
stopped
turning
to
see
who
came
mallett
it
was
the
voice
of
francis
sales
she
sank
down
on
a
heap
of
stones
panting
and
laughing
he
sat
beside
her
the
matter
do
know
i
hate
to
hear
anybody
coming
behind
me
it
might
have
been
a
tramp
i
very
much
afraid
of
tramps
said
i
would
see
you
home
i
forgot
let
us
go
on
did
stay
long
do
think
mrs
sales
is
very
well
is
she
gets
hysterical
and
that
affects
her
heart
i
thought
you
would
do
her
good
he
seemed
to
blame
henrietta
i
thought
a
walk
with
you
would
do
me
good
too
i
have
a
pretty
dull
life
you
interested
in
your
cows
and
things
man
ca
live
on
cows
you
have
other
things
and
you
live
in
the
country
people
have
everything
i
do
suppose
you
change
with
anybody
really
if
you
could
people
are
like
that
they
grumble
but
they
like
being
themselves
suppose
you
were
a
young
man
in
a
shop
measuring
cloth
or
selling
bacon
you
find
that
much
duller
i
should
think
he
laughed
a
little
did
you
learn
this
wisdom
had
experience
she
said
staidly
you
find
it
duller
you
right
but
then
you
might
come
to
buy
the
bacon
i
should
look
forward
to
that
in
the
darkness
these
playful
words
frightened
her
a
little
they
hurt
her
sense
of
what
was
fitting
from
him
to
her
and
at
the
same
time
they
pleased
her
with
their
hint
of
danger
you
she
asked
slowly
he
paused
saying
i
light
a
pipe
and
by
the
flame
of
the
match
he
examined
her
face
quite
openly
for
a
moment
know
i
would
he
said
she
met
his
look
her
eyes
wavered
and
neither
spoke
for
a
long
time
she
was
oppressed
by
his
nearness
the
smell
of
his
tobacco
her
own
inexplicable
delight
from
the
trees
by
the
roadside
birds
gave
out
happy
chirrups
country
people
in
their
sunday
clothes
and
creaking
boots
passed
or
overtook
the
silent
pair
a
man
on
a
horse
rode
out
from
a
gate
and
cantered
with
very
little
noise
on
the
rough
grass
edging
the
road
henrietta
watched
him
until
he
disappeared
and
then
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
never
been
there
at
all
a
sheep
in
a
field
uttered
a
sad
cry
and
every
sight
and
sound
seemed
a
little
unreal
like
things
happening
on
a
stage
and
gradually
henrietta
excitement
left
her
the
world
seemed
a
sad
and
lonely
place
she
remembered
that
she
herself
was
lonely
there
was
no
one
now
to
whom
she
was
the
first
and
she
had
a
longing
for
her
mother
she
wished
that
instead
of
returning
to
nelson
lodge
with
its
cleanliness
and
richness
and
comfort
she
might
turn
the
key
of
the
door
and
find
herself
in
the
narrow
passage
with
the
smell
of
cooking
and
the
gas
turned
low
she
wished
she
could
run
up
the
stairs
and
rush
into
the
and
find
her
mother
sitting
there
sewing
by
the
fire
and
see
her
look
up
and
hear
her
say
henry
dear
what
have
you
been
doing
after
all
that
old
life
was
better
than
this
new
one
the
troubles
of
her
mother
her
own
young
struggles
for
food
and
warmth
the
woes
of
banks
had
in
them
something
nobler
than
she
could
find
in
the
distresses
of
christabel
and
aunt
rose
and
francis
sales
something
redeeming
them
from
the
sordidness
in
which
they
were
set
she
checked
a
sob
a
long
way
she
sighed
you
tired
his
voice
was
gentle
dreadfully
let
us
sit
down
again
i
must
go
on
i
must
get
back
you
would
talk
to
me
you
would
notice
the
distance
do
want
to
talk
i
thinking
when
we
get
to
the
bridge
you
can
go
back
ca
you
there
will
be
lights
and
i
shall
be
quite
safe
well
but
i
wish
you
tell
me
what
the
matter
very
unhappy
henrietta
said
with
a
sob
on
earth
for
look
here
he
touched
her
arm
christabel
say
anything
do
know
why
it
is
you
going
to
cry
no
good
crying
he
held
the
arm
now
quite
firmly
and
they
faced
each
other
better
tell
me
the
whole
story
her
lips
quivered
she
wished
he
would
loosen
his
grip
and
hoped
he
would
go
on
holding
her
for
ever
it
was
a
moment
of
mingled
ecstasy
and
sadness
she
almost
wailed
i
be
unhappy
if
i
want
to
he
gave
a
short
laugh
saying
little
girl
and
stooping
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
she
endured
that
kiss
willingly
for
a
moment
and
then
very
lightly
struck
him
in
the
face
afterwards
there
was
some
satisfaction
in
thinking
that
she
had
done
the
dramatic
thing
what
the
heroine
always
did
to
the
villain
but
at
the
time
the
action
was
spontaneous
and
unconsidered
henrietta
was
not
really
avenging
an
insult
she
was
simply
expressing
her
annoyance
at
her
pleasure
in
it
being
when
she
chose
a
sighted
young
woman
she
realized
this
but
she
also
knew
that
francis
sales
would
find
the
obvious
meaning
in
the
blow
for
herself
she
sanely
determined
to
blot
that
episode
from
her
mind
it
was
maddening
to
think
of
it
as
an
insult
and
dangerous
to
remember
its
delight
and
she
was
able
calmly
to
tell
her
aunts
that
mr
sales
had
seen
her
home
why
did
he
come
in
caroline
asked
with
a
grunt
you
on
the
doorstep
like
a
housemaid
only
came
as
far
as
the
bridge
dear
child
what
was
he
thinking
of
men
are
not
what
they
were
or
is
it
the
women
who
are
different
they
have
the
charm
they
have
the
old
charm
my
difficulty
was
always
to
get
rid
of
the
creatures
i
disappointed
in
you
henrietta
he
married
henrietta
said
gravely
only
needed
him
on
the
dark
roads
and
i
should
think
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
mrs
sales
would
be
the
first
time
then
caroline
said
is
he
fond
of
her
ask
dangerous
questions
child
and
would
you
be
fond
of
her
yourself
very
pretty
caroline
do
sophia
begged
caroline
chuckled
what
what
you
were
going
to
say
caroline
chuckled
again
ca
help
it
my
tongue
wo
be
tied
i
like
all
the
malletts
not
before
the
child
a
prude
sophia
and
if
henrietta
imagines
that
a
man
like
francis
sales
any
man
worth
his
salt
besides
henrietta
has
knocked
about
the
world
she
is
no
more
innocent
than
she
looks
does
mean
half
she
says
sophia
whispered
neither
is
francis
sales
caroline
persisted
dark
roads
indeed
i
do
think
i
care
for
your
wandering
about
at
night
henrietta
wo
do
it
again
henrietta
said
meekly
and
i
caroline
began
one
of
her
reminiscences
to
which
neither
sophia
nor
henrietta
listened
to
the
one
they
were
familiar
in
their
exaggeration
and
the
other
had
her
own
thoughts
which
were
bewilderingly
confused
she
had
meant
to
stand
between
francis
sales
and
aunt
rose
later
she
had
wished
to
help
them
now
she
did
not
know
whether
she
wanted
to
help
or
hinder
the
thing
was
too
much
for
her
but
she
wondered
if
aunt
rose
had
ever
experienced
such
a
kiss
meeting
her
a
few
minutes
later
on
the
stairs
with
her
slim
hand
on
the
polished
rail
a
beautiful
foot
gleaming
below
the
lace
of
her
dress
she
seemed
a
being
too
ethereal
for
a
salute
so
earthly
and
because
she
looked
so
lovely
because
christabel
had
been
unjust
henrietta
forgot
to
feel
unfriendly
rose
said
unexpectedly
henrietta
i
am
glad
you
have
come
back
you
seem
to
have
been
away
for
a
long
time
went
to
the
battys
to
tea
and
then
to
sales
hall
i
promised
mrs
sales
do
you
mind
course
not
but
i
missed
you
oh
i
never
thought
of
that
always
miss
you
rose
said
gravely
have
made
a
great
difference
to
us
all
henrietta
mouth
opened
with
astonishment
had
no
idea
and
i
do
nothing
but
enjoy
myself
rose
laughed
what
we
want
you
to
do
you
must
be
as
happy
as
you
can
this
from
aunt
rose
was
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
had
happened
yet
henrietta
was
overcome
by
astonishment
and
gratitude
had
no
idea
i
never
dreamt
of
your
liking
me
i
thought
you
just
put
up
with
me
have
given
me
much
chance
rose
said
in
a
low
voice
doing
anything
else
it
was
true
henrietta
could
not
flourish
when
she
thought
herself
unappreciated
but
now
she
expanded
like
a
flower
blossoming
in
a
night
if
we
could
be
friends
there
nobody
to
talk
to
except
charles
batty
and
i
hated
i
simply
hated
being
at
sales
hall
she
tightened
her
lips
and
opened
them
to
say
sha
go
there
again
i
said
so
she
is
a
terrible
woman
has
a
great
deal
to
bear
and
she
counts
on
your
remembering
that
henrietta
said
acutely
was
the
matter
henrietta
whispered
and
she
added
nervously
you
rose
made
a
slight
movement
tell
me
the
cat
i
ran
away
she
was
crying
but
i
did
care
i
ran
all
down
the
avenue
on
to
the
road
mr
sales
had
said
he
would
take
me
home
but
i
did
wait
it
was
much
better
under
the
sky
then
i
heard
footsteps
and
it
was
mr
sales
running
after
me
she
paused
two
stairs
above
her
aunt
rose
stood
listening
with
attention
she
was
as
usual
all
black
and
white
her
neck
rising
from
the
black
lace
looked
like
a
bowl
of
cream
laid
out
of
doors
to
cool
in
the
night
kissed
me
henrietta
said
abruptly
rose
did
not
move
and
before
she
spoke
henrietta
had
time
to
wonder
what
had
prompted
her
to
that
confession
she
had
not
thought
about
it
the
words
had
simply
issued
of
themselves
you
henrietta
said
and
suddenly
she
wanted
to
make
it
easier
for
aunt
rose
think
he
was
sorry
for
me
i
told
him
i
was
unhappy
but
i
could
tell
him
why
i
could
say
it
was
his
wife
i
think
he
meant
it
kindly
am
sure
he
did
rose
said
with
admirable
look
very
young
in
that
big
hat
you
are
very
young
and
perhaps
he
guessed
what
you
had
been
through
do
think
about
it
any
more
henrietta
seemed
to
have
no
control
over
her
tongue
then
you
see
i
hit
him
rose
managed
a
laugh
henrietta
how
primitive
henrietta
agreed
but
she
knew
she
had
betrayed
francis
sales
she
knew
and
rose
knew
that
she
would
not
have
struck
him
if
the
kiss
had
been
paternal
suppose
it
was
vulgar
she
murmured
sadly
yet
not
without
some
skill
rose
descended
the
two
stairs
without
a
word
and
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
flight
but
there
she
paused
saying
off
your
things
and
let
us
have
some
music
henrietta
was
learning
to
sing
and
in
defiance
of
charles
prophecy
she
neither
squeaked
nor
gurgled
she
piped
with
a
pretty
simplicity
and
with
an
enjoyment
which
made
her
forget
herself
yet
she
looked
charming
standing
in
the
beside
the
shining
grand
piano
on
which
aunt
rose
accompanied
her
and
she
felt
they
were
united
in
more
than
the
music
they
were
friends
they
were
and
long
after
henrietta
had
tired
of
singing
rose
went
on
playing
mournfully
as
it
seemed
to
henrietta
consoling
herself
with
sweet
sounds
sophia
sat
before
her
embroidery
frame
slowly
pushing
her
needle
in
and
out
caroline
read
a
novel
with
avidity
and
an
occasional
pause
for
chuckles
and
when
rose
at
length
dropped
her
hands
on
her
knees
and
remained
motionless
staring
at
the
keys
henrietta
startled
her
aunts
by
saying
firmly
am
just
going
to
enjoy
life
rose
raised
her
head
and
her
enigmatic
smile
widened
a
little
caroline
exclaimed
gracious
why
not
sophia
said
gently
is
what
we
wish
henrietta
stiffened
herself
for
questions
which
did
not
come
nobody
expressed
a
desire
to
know
what
had
caused
this
solemn
declaration
caroline
went
on
reading
sophia
embroidering
rose
retired
to
bed
henrietta
was
not
daunted
by
this
indifference
she
persisted
in
her
determination
she
cast
off
all
thoughts
of
ministering
like
an
angel
or
revenging
like
a
demon
she
enjoyed
the
gaieties
with
which
the
youth
of
radstowe
amused
itself
during
the
summer
months
she
accompanied
her
aunts
to
garden
parties
ate
ices
had
her
fortune
told
in
tents
flirted
mildly
and
endured
charles
batty
peculiar
tyranny
nothing
went
amiss
with
charles
but
what
he
seemed
to
blame
her
for
it
and
while
she
resented
this
strange
form
of
attention
she
had
a
compensating
conviction
that
he
was
really
paying
tribute
and
she
knew
that
the
absence
of
his
complaints
would
have
left
a
blank
fixing
her
with
his
pale
eyes
he
described
the
bitterness
of
life
in
his
father
office
his
mismanagement
of
clients
his
father
sneers
his
mother
sighs
his
sufferings
in
not
being
allowed
to
go
to
germany
and
study
music
i
were
a
man
henrietta
said
voicing
a
pathetic
faith
in
masculine
ability
to
break
bonds
would
do
what
i
liked
i
go
to
germany
and
starve
and
be
happy
a
man
can
do
and
get
anything
he
really
wants
i
shall
remember
that
he
said
i
ca
go
to
germany
now
he
added
darkly
and
when
she
asked
him
for
a
reason
he
groaned
you
even
you
do
understand
me
in
this
respect
she
understood
him
perfectly
well
but
she
did
not
wish
to
clear
the
mysterious
gloom
not
devoid
of
excitement
in
which
they
moved
together
and
they
parted
for
the
summer
holidays
miserably
on
his
part
cheerfully
on
hers
she
was
going
to
scotland
with
aunt
rose
and
the
prospect
was
so
delightful
that
she
did
not
trouble
to
inquire
about
his
movements
she
was
surprised
and
almost
disappointed
that
he
did
not
reproach
her
for
this
thoughtlessness
when
on
her
return
she
went
to
call
on
batty
and
hear
about
her
annual
holiday
at
bournemouth
batty
had
suffered
very
much
from
the
heat
batty
had
suffered
from
dyspepsia
and
they
were
glad
to
be
at
home
again
though
it
was
to
find
that
john
without
a
hint
to
his
parents
had
engaged
himself
to
a
girl
with
tastes
like
his
own
it
with
her
instead
of
terriers
batty
sighed
brings
them
here
and
they
slobber
on
the
carpets
dirty
things
and
golf
but
she
a
nice
girl
and
they
go
out
before
breakfast
with
the
dogs
and
have
a
game
but
i
did
hope
he
would
look
elsewhere
dear
she
gazed
sentimentally
at
henrietta
do
feel
she
will
ever
be
a
daughter
to
me
of
course
i
kissed
her
and
all
that
when
i
heard
the
news
but
now
she
just
comes
in
and
says
hullo
batty
where
john
and
that
all
i
do
like
affection
she
kiss
the
though
batty
added
grimly
whether
she
ever
kisses
john
i
ca
say
and
as
for
charles
he
never
looks
at
a
girl
so
i
as
badly
off
as
ever
worse
for
charles
really
charles
has
a
word
to
throw
at
me
he
comes
down
to
breakfast
and
think
the
bacon
had
upset
him
and
it
the
best
i
can
get
and
his
father
sits
reading
the
paper
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
over
the
edge
at
charles
he
very
cool
batty
is
half
the
time
john
comes
in
late
for
breakfast
after
his
game
you
know
and
then
he
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
talk
they
might
all
be
dumb
with
charles
it
all
that
piano
business
i
tell
him
i
wish
he
go
to
germany
and
be
done
with
it
though
i
never
think
musicians
are
respectable
with
all
that
hair
anyhow
charles
is
getting
bald
and
he
says
he
too
old
to
start
afresh
and
then
he
glares
at
his
father
it
all
very
unpleasant
still
he
a
good
boy
really
they
both
good
boys
i
a
lot
to
be
thankful
for
and
my
dear
her
voice
sank
and
she
laid
a
plump
hand
on
henrietta
batty
says
we
may
give
a
ball
after
christmas
everybody
in
radstowe
we
shall
take
the
assembly
rooms
the
date
is
fixed
and
now
and
then
if
he
is
feeling
well
batty
says
he
ca
afford
it
but
that
nonsense
we
shall
have
it
but
do
say
a
word
i
told
nobody
else
but
somehow
henrietta
i
always
want
to
tell
you
everything
as
if
you
were
my
daughter
batty
sighed
heavily
only
charles
were
different
however
charles
surprised
his
mother
that
evening
by
walking
to
the
gate
with
henrietta
arrived
there
he
announced
firmly
that
he
would
take
her
home
going
for
a
walk
henrietta
said
a
walk
well
all
right
where
shall
we
go
i
know
i
will
take
you
where
you
never
been
before
it
was
october
and
already
the
lamps
were
lighted
in
the
streets
they
studded
the
bridge
like
fairy
lanterns
for
a
fairy
path
to
that
world
of
woods
and
stealthy
lanes
and
open
country
where
the
wind
rustled
the
gorse
bushes
on
the
other
side
below
at
the
water
edge
more
lamps
stood
like
sentinels
here
and
there
straight
and
lonely
fulfilling
their
task
and
as
charles
and
henrietta
watched
the
terraces
of
radstowe
became
illuminated
by
an
unseen
hand
over
everything
there
was
a
suggestion
of
enchantment
lovers
strolling
by
were
romantic
in
their
silence
a
faint
hoot
from
some
steamer
was
like
a
laugh
will
be
dark
over
there
wo
it
henrietta
asked
we
cut
across
the
fields
to
sales
hall
hall
what
for
to
see
that
miserable
fellow
we
not
going
near
sales
hall
she
breathed
a
word
did
you
say
he
asked
she
breathed
again
in
the
winter
she
said
hopefully
should
think
they
shut
them
up
at
night
poor
things
cold
enough
yet
for
that
afraid
of
them
you
know
animals
he
said
calmly
she
whispered
they
said
no
more
their
path
edged
those
woods
which
in
their
turn
edged
the
gorge
but
here
and
there
the
trees
spread
themselves
more
freely
and
through
the
darkness
henrietta
had
glimpses
of
furtive
little
paths
of
dips
and
hollows
a
small
pool
thick
with
early
fallen
leaves
had
hardly
a
foot
of
gleaming
surface
with
which
to
gaze
like
an
unwinking
eye
at
the
emerging
stars
but
this
skirting
of
the
wood
came
to
an
end
and
there
stretched
before
their
feet
which
made
the
only
sound
in
the
quiet
night
a
broad
white
road
where
the
arched
gateway
of
a
distant
house
looked
like
the
fragment
of
a
temple
like
this
henrietta
said
feel
safe
for
long
charles
replied
sternly
he
opened
a
gate
and
through
a
little
coppice
they
reached
a
fence
have
to
climb
it
the
broad
fields
on
the
other
side
were
as
dark
as
water
and
as
still
it
was
surprising
when
she
jumped
down
to
find
she
did
not
sink
to
find
that
she
and
charles
could
walk
steadily
on
this
blackness
cut
here
and
there
by
the
deeper
blackness
of
a
hedge
there
were
no
cows
but
sheep
stumbled
up
and
bleated
at
their
approach
and
for
some
time
the
tinkling
of
the
bell
accompanied
them
like
music
a
stile
here
charles
said
and
from
this
they
plunged
into
another
wood
where
birds
fluttered
and
twittered
and
in
the
undergrowth
there
were
small
stealthy
sounds
would
come
here
alone
henrietta
said
all
the
world
charles
said
nothing
batty
was
right
it
was
like
walking
with
a
dumb
man
they
left
the
wood
and
walked
downhill
beside
a
ploughed
field
and
in
the
shelter
of
a
high
wall
an
open
lane
brought
them
to
a
gate
the
gate
opened
on
a
rough
road
through
yet
another
wood
of
larch
and
spruce
and
fir
the
road
was
deeply
rutted
and
they
walked
in
single
file
until
charles
turned
saying
is
what
brought
you
to
see
this
is
the
monks
pool
a
large
pond
almost
round
and
strewn
with
dead
leaves
about
its
edge
lay
sombrely
on
their
right
hand
without
a
movement
without
a
gleam
it
was
like
a
pall
covering
something
secret
something
which
must
never
be
revealed
and
opposite
where
the
ground
rose
steeply
tall
firs
stood
up
guardians
of
the
unknown
faint
quackings
came
from
some
unseen
ducks
among
the
willows
and
water
gurgled
at
the
invisible
outlet
of
the
pond
there
were
little
stirrings
and
sighings
among
the
trees
the
protruding
roots
of
an
oak
offered
a
seat
to
henrietta
and
behind
her
charles
leaned
against
the
trunk
it
was
comfortable
to
have
him
there
to
be
able
to
look
at
this
dark
beauty
without
fear
and
as
she
sat
there
she
heard
an
number
of
little
sounds
they
were
caused
by
she
knew
not
what
small
creatures
moving
among
the
pine
needles
night
birds
on
the
watch
for
prey
water
rats
the
flop
of
fish
the
fall
of
some
leaf
on
the
tree
her
own
slow
breathing
the
muffled
ticking
of
her
heart
and
into
this
orchestra
of
tiny
instruments
there
came
slowly
and
as
if
it
grew
out
of
all
these
another
sound
it
was
the
voice
of
charles
and
it
was
so
much
a
part
of
this
rare
experience
it
seemed
so
right
a
complement
that
at
first
she
did
not
listen
to
the
sense
of
what
he
said
the
words
had
no
clearer
meaning
than
had
the
other
voices
of
the
night
the
whole
thing
was
wonderful
the
tall
immobile
trees
the
small
secret
sounds
the
black
lake
like
an
immense
mysterious
pall
the
steady
booming
of
the
voice
had
the
effect
of
magic
this
was
essential
beauty
revealed
to
her
ears
and
eyes
but
gradually
the
words
formed
themselves
into
sentences
and
were
carried
to
her
brain
she
understood
that
charles
was
talking
of
himself
of
her
with
an
eloquence
born
of
thoughts
he
was
telling
her
how
she
appeared
to
him
as
a
being
of
light
and
sweetness
and
necessity
he
was
telling
her
how
he
loved
her
he
was
asking
for
nothing
but
he
was
saying
amazing
things
in
language
worthy
of
his
thoughts
of
her
that
muffled
ticking
of
her
heart
went
on
like
distant
drum
beats
the
symphony
of
tiny
instruments
did
not
pause
the
dominant
sound
of
charles
voice
continued
and
now
as
she
listened
she
heard
nothing
but
his
voice
he
was
not
pathetic
he
did
not
plead
he
did
not
claim
he
spoke
of
very
old
and
lasting
things
and
it
was
like
hearing
some
one
read
a
tale
she
did
not
stir
she
forgot
that
this
was
charles
it
was
a
simple
heart
become
articulate
and
then
suddenly
the
voice
stopped
and
the
orchestra
as
though
in
relief
in
triumph
seemed
to
play
more
loudly
a
water
rat
dived
again
a
duck
quacked
sleepily
and
a
branch
of
a
tree
creaked
mournfully
under
a
lost
puff
of
wind
henrietta
turned
her
head
and
saw
charles
batty
standing
motionless
against
the
tree
his
hat
was
tilted
a
little
to
one
side
and
his
eyes
were
staring
straight
before
him
even
the
darkness
was
not
entirely
kind
to
him
but
that
did
not
matter
she
wondered
if
he
knew
what
he
had
been
saying
she
could
not
remember
it
all
but
it
would
come
back
as
they
went
home
over
the
dark
fields
she
would
remember
it
it
seemed
to
have
everything
and
yet
nothing
to
do
with
her
it
was
like
poetry
that
without
embarrassment
profoundly
moves
the
hearer
and
his
very
voice
had
developed
the
dignity
of
his
theme
he
did
not
speak
again
in
complete
silence
they
retraced
their
steps
and
at
the
gate
of
nelson
lodge
he
left
her
in
the
little
garden
she
stood
still
this
had
been
a
wonderful
experience
she
felt
uplifted
better
than
herself
yet
she
could
not
resist
speculating
on
her
probable
feelings
if
another
than
charles
batty
if
for
instance
francis
sales
had
poured
that
rhapsody
into
the
night
book
iii
rose
and
henrietta
early
one
october
afternoon
rose
mallett
rode
to
sales
hall
she
went
through
a
world
of
brown
and
gold
and
blue
but
she
was
hardly
conscious
of
beauty
and
the
air
which
was
soft
yet
keen
and
exciting
to
her
horse
had
no
inspiriting
effect
on
her
she
felt
old
incased
in
a
sort
of
mental
weariness
which
was
like
armour
against
emotion
she
knew
that
the
spirit
of
the
country
at
once
gentle
and
wild
furtive
and
bold
was
trying
to
reach
her
in
every
scent
and
sound
in
the
smell
of
earth
of
fruit
of
burning
wood
in
the
noise
of
her
horse
feet
as
he
cantered
on
the
grassy
side
of
the
road
in
the
fall
of
a
leaf
the
call
of
a
bird
or
a
human
voice
become
significant
in
distance
but
she
remained
unmoved
this
was
she
thought
like
being
dead
yet
conscious
of
all
that
happened
but
the
dead
have
the
excuse
of
death
and
she
had
none
she
was
merely
tired
of
her
mode
of
life
it
seemed
to
her
that
in
her
years
the
sum
of
her
achievement
was
looking
beautiful
and
being
loved
by
francis
sales
she
put
it
in
that
way
but
immediately
corrected
herself
unwillingly
her
attitude
towards
him
had
not
been
passive
she
had
loved
him
she
had
owed
him
love
and
she
had
paid
her
debt
she
had
paid
enough
yet
if
he
asked
for
more
she
would
give
it
her
pride
hoped
for
that
demand
her
weariness
shrank
from
it
and
he
had
kissed
henrietta
the
sharpness
of
that
thought
on
which
from
the
first
moment
on
the
stairs
she
had
refused
to
dwell
steeling
her
mind
against
it
with
a
determination
which
perhaps
accounted
for
her
fatigue
was
like
a
physical
pain
running
through
her
whole
body
so
that
the
horse
feeling
an
unaccustomed
jerk
on
his
mouth
became
alarmed
and
restive
she
steadied
him
and
herself
a
kiss
was
nothing
yet
she
had
always
denied
it
to
francis
sales
she
could
not
blame
him
for
she
saw
how
her
own
fastidiousness
had
endangered
his
he
needed
material
evidence
of
love
she
ought
she
supposed
to
have
sacrificed
her
scruples
for
his
sake
mentally
she
had
already
done
it
and
the
physical
refusal
was
perhaps
no
more
than
pride
which
salved
her
conscience
and
might
ruin
his
but
it
existed
firmly
like
a
fortress
she
could
not
surrender
it
her
love
was
not
great
enough
for
that
or
was
it
she
asked
herself
too
great
she
could
not
comfort
herself
with
that
illusion
and
there
came
creeping
the
thought
that
for
some
one
else
some
one
too
strong
to
need
such
a
capitulation
she
would
have
given
it
gladly
but
against
francis
who
was
intrinsically
weak
she
had
held
out
life
seemed
to
mock
at
her
it
offered
the
wrong
opportunities
it
strewed
her
path
with
chances
of
which
no
human
being
could
judge
the
value
until
the
choice
had
been
made
it
was
like
walking
over
ground
pitted
with
hidden
holes
it
needed
luck
as
well
as
skill
to
avoid
a
fall
but
like
other
people
she
had
to
pursue
her
road
the
thing
was
to
hide
her
bruises
even
from
herself
and
shake
off
the
dust
she
had
by
this
time
reached
the
track
which
was
connected
with
so
much
of
her
life
and
she
drew
rein
in
astonishment
they
were
felling
the
trees
already
a
space
had
been
cleared
and
men
and
horses
were
busy
removing
the
fallen
trunks
piles
of
branches
still
bravely
green
lay
here
and
there
and
the
pine
needles
of
the
past
were
now
overlaid
by
chippings
from
the
parent
trees
what
had
been
a
still
place
of
shadows
of
muffled
sounds
of
solemn
aisles
the
scene
of
a
secret
life
not
revealed
to
men
was
now
half
devastated
trampled
and
loud
with
human
noises
it
had
its
own
beauty
of
colour
and
activity
there
was
even
a
new
splendour
in
the
unencumbered
ground
but
rose
had
a
sense
of
loss
and
sacrilege
something
had
gone
it
struck
her
that
here
she
was
reminded
of
herself
something
had
gone
the
larch
trees
which
had
flamed
in
green
for
her
each
spring
were
dead
and
she
had
this
strange
dead
feeling
in
her
heart
she
saw
the
figure
of
francis
sales
detach
itself
from
a
little
group
and
advance
towards
her
she
knew
what
he
would
say
he
would
tell
her
in
that
sulky
way
of
his
how
many
weeks
had
passed
since
he
had
seen
her
and
to
avoid
hearing
that
remark
she
at
once
waved
a
hand
towards
the
clearing
and
said
have
you
done
this
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
get
money
they
were
my
trees
never
wrote
he
muttered
she
made
a
gesture
quickly
controlled
long
ago
when
in
the
first
exultation
of
their
love
and
their
sense
of
richness
they
had
marked
out
the
limits
of
their
intercourse
so
that
they
might
keep
some
sort
of
faith
with
christabel
and
preserve
what
was
precious
to
themselves
it
had
been
decided
that
they
were
not
to
meet
by
appointment
they
were
not
to
speak
of
love
no
letters
were
to
be
exchanged
and
though
time
had
bent
the
first
and
second
rules
the
last
had
been
kept
with
rigour
it
was
understood
but
periodically
she
had
to
submit
to
francis
sales
complaint
never
wrote
you
cut
down
the
trees
she
said
half
playfully
did
you
write
francis
you
know
quite
well
he
was
looking
at
the
ground
he
had
not
once
looked
at
her
since
her
greeting
go
off
on
a
holiday
enjoying
yourself
while
i
who
did
you
go
with
henrietta
rose
said
softly
that
girl
that
girl
but
here
i
am
i
have
come
back
she
seemed
to
invite
him
to
be
glad
she
went
on
calmly
feeling
that
it
did
not
matter
what
she
said
a
queer
world
to
come
back
to
i
miss
the
trees
they
stood
for
my
childhood
and
my
youth
yes
they
stood
for
it
so
straight
i
must
go
on
christabel
is
expecting
me
did
tell
me
rose
questioned
without
surprise
suppose
i
shall
see
you
at
tea
she
said
he
nodded
and
she
touched
her
horse
something
had
happened
to
him
as
well
as
to
her
and
a
mass
of
pain
lodged
itself
in
her
breast
he
was
different
and
as
though
he
had
suspected
the
weary
quality
of
her
love
he
had
met
her
with
the
same
kind
or
perhaps
with
none
at
all
a
little
while
ago
she
was
half
longing
for
release
from
this
endless
necessity
of
controlling
herself
and
him
from
the
shifts
the
refusals
and
the
reproaches
which
had
gradually
become
the
chief
part
of
their
intercourse
and
now
he
had
dared
to
seem
indifferent
though
he
had
not
forgotten
to
reproach
she
could
almost
feel
the
healthy
pallor
of
her
face
change
to
a
sickly
white
her
anger
chilled
and
then
stiffened
her
into
a
rigidity
of
body
and
mind
and
when
she
dismounted
she
slid
down
heavily
like
a
figure
made
of
wood
the
man
who
took
her
horse
looked
at
her
curiously
miss
mallett
always
had
a
pleasant
word
for
him
and
conscious
of
his
stare
she
forced
a
smile
she
had
not
ridden
for
weeks
she
told
him
she
was
tired
he
was
amused
at
that
she
had
been
born
in
the
saddle
he
remembered
her
as
a
little
girl
on
a
shetland
pony
and
he
did
not
believe
she
could
ever
tire
be
something
wrong
somewhere
he
said
examining
girth
and
pommels
old
age
coming
on
rose
said
gravely
he
thought
that
a
great
joke
he
was
twice
her
age
already
and
considered
himself
in
his
prime
he
led
the
horse
away
and
rose
went
into
the
house
how
extraordinarily
limited
her
life
had
been
it
had
passed
almost
entirely
in
this
house
and
nelson
lodge
and
on
the
road
between
the
two
of
all
her
experiences
the
only
ones
that
mattered
had
been
suffered
here
and
they
had
all
been
of
one
kind
even
fewer
years
had
been
more
varied
she
had
known
poverty
and
been
compelled
to
the
practical
application
of
her
wits
she
had
baffled
jenkins
she
had
been
kissed
by
francis
sales
rose
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
and
looked
for
the
mirror
which
was
not
there
she
did
not
wish
to
give
christabel
sales
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
look
distraught
but
a
peep
in
the
glass
of
one
of
the
sporting
prints
reassured
her
her
appearance
almost
made
her
doubt
the
reality
of
the
feelings
which
consisted
of
a
great
heat
in
the
head
and
a
deadly
cold
weight
near
her
heart
and
which
forced
these
triumphant
words
from
her
lips
least
henrietta
has
never
felt
like
this
she
entered
christabel
room
calmly
smiling
and
prepared
for
news
but
at
the
first
sight
of
the
invalid
lying
very
low
in
her
bed
and
barely
turning
her
head
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
door
she
thought
that
perhaps
christabel
weakness
had
at
last
overcome
her
enmity
very
ill
she
said
faintly
sorry
do
say
that
you
may
as
well
tell
the
truth
to
me
i
must
say
again
that
i
am
sorry
wonder
why
to
that
rose
made
no
answer
and
before
christabel
spoke
again
she
had
time
to
notice
that
the
cat
had
gone
she
breathed
more
easily
the
cat
had
gone
the
trees
were
going
and
francis
was
going
too
suddenly
she
felt
she
did
not
care
the
idea
of
an
empty
world
was
pleasant
but
if
francis
were
really
going
the
cat
might
as
well
have
stayed
me
what
you
did
in
scotland
christabel
said
showed
henrietta
all
the
sights
henrietta
she
a
horrid
girl
she
has
stopped
coming
to
see
me
made
yourself
so
unpleasant
she
tell
you
that
do
you
think
she
told
francis
know
she
did
i
ca
make
out
why
she
should
tell
you
and
i
are
great
friends
did
you
manage
that
do
know
rose
said
slowly
has
happened
to
the
cat
gone
it
went
out
and
never
came
back
queer
one
must
have
killed
it
do
think
so
rose
said
thoughtfully
think
it
decided
to
go
i
sure
it
did
do
you
mean
what
do
you
mean
christabel
cried
you
something
to
do
with
that
too
that
i
know
of
rose
laughed
she
was
tired
of
considering
every
word
before
she
uttered
it
that
too
christabel
repeated
a
little
wildly
and
then
in
a
firm
voice
she
said
got
to
tell
me
i
do
know
you
must
make
all
inquiries
of
the
cat
it
was
a
wise
animal
it
knew
the
time
had
come
think
you
mad
christabel
said
are
very
strange
rose
went
on
easily
rats
leave
sinking
ships
a
cry
of
terror
came
from
christabel
mean
i
going
to
die
no
rose
became
sane
and
reassuring
never
thought
of
that
it
might
have
known
it
was
going
to
die
itself
and
an
animal
likes
to
die
decently
alone
it
had
been
getting
unhealthily
fat
christabel
kept
an
exhausted
silence
and
rose
regretting
her
cruelty
aware
of
its
futility
said
gently
i
get
you
a
kitten
no
kitten
they
jump
about
the
old
cat
was
so
quiet
and
i
miss
him
a
tear
rolled
down
either
cheek
has
been
so
lonely
everybody
was
away
we
all
come
back
now
rose
said
but
that
henrietta
she
deserted
me
was
your
own
fault
christabel
you
horrified
her
should
have
been
you
who
did
that
do
always
have
the
effect
we
hope
for
you
said
too
much
but
not
half
what
i
could
have
said
much
for
henrietta
anyhow
i
do
think
she
will
come
again
christabel
smiled
oddly
and
rose
knew
that
now
she
was
to
hear
some
news
can
tell
her
christabel
said
i
sha
say
anything
to
upset
her
i
shall
say
nothing
about
you
as
she
loves
you
so
much
does
she
love
you
i
dare
say
you
make
people
love
you
for
a
little
while
her
voice
lingered
on
those
words
for
a
little
while
but
you
do
keep
love
rose
mallett
no
you
do
i
sorry
for
you
now
tell
henrietta
she
need
be
afraid
because
i
sorry
for
you
yes
you
and
i
are
in
the
same
boat
in
the
same
deserted
boat
if
there
were
any
rats
they
would
run
away
you
said
so
yourself
said
the
cat
had
gone
you
knew
rose
shook
her
head
it
was
her
turn
to
smile
she
was
prepared
for
anything
christabel
might
say
she
was
even
anxious
to
hear
it
but
when
christabel
spoke
in
a
mysteriously
gleeful
manner
she
had
difficulty
in
repressing
a
shudder
it
was
not
she
told
herself
that
she
suffered
from
the
knowledge
now
imparted
by
christabel
with
detail
and
with
proofs
but
her
malice
her
salacious
curiosity
were
more
than
rose
could
bear
she
felt
that
the
whole
affair
which
at
first
so
long
ago
had
possessed
a
noble
sadness
a
secret
beauty
the
quality
of
a
precious
substance
enclosed
in
a
common
vial
was
indecent
and
unclean
you
see
christabel
said
have
kept
him
you
wo
keep
henrietta
rose
said
nothing
she
was
thinking
of
what
she
might
have
done
and
she
was
glad
she
had
not
done
it
do
seem
to
mind
christabel
said
do
you
ask
me
why
i
so
sure
she
laughed
ought
to
know
how
to
find
things
out
by
this
time
and
i
know
francis
yes
better
than
you
do
when
i
had
my
accident
it
was
worth
it
was
it
i
said
to
myself
he
be
faithful
to
me
when
i
knew
i
should
have
to
lie
here
i
told
myself
that
and
now
you
her
voice
almost
failed
her
suppose
you
have
been
kind
enough
to
him
think
it
time
i
went
rose
said
you
never
come
back
if
you
want
me
can
say
what
i
like
to
you
can
indeed
rose
murmured
tell
henrietta
to
come
too
i
ca
ask
henrietta
promise
to
be
like
a
maiden
aunt
ah
but
she
has
three
already
she
knows
what
they
are
that
wo
attract
her
i
be
like
an
invalid
in
a
sunday
school
tell
her
of
your
promise
rose
said
there
remained
the
task
of
having
tea
with
francis
sales
and
breaking
the
bonds
of
which
he
had
tired
she
made
it
easy
for
him
that
was
necessary
for
her
dignity
but
beyond
the
desire
for
as
much
seemliness
as
could
be
saved
from
the
general
ugliness
of
their
mistake
she
had
no
feeling
yet
she
thought
it
would
be
good
to
be
in
the
open
air
on
horseback
free
if
there
had
been
anything
still
owing
she
had
paid
her
debt
with
generosity
she
gave
him
the
chance
he
wanted
but
did
not
know
how
to
take
and
she
had
to
allow
him
to
appear
aggrieved
she
was
cruel
she
was
tired
of
him
she
was
he
sneered
too
good
for
him
the
words
went
on
for
some
time
and
if
some
of
them
were
new
their
manner
was
wearisomely
familiar
she
was
amazed
at
her
own
endurance
now
and
in
the
past
and
at
last
she
said
no
francis
say
no
more
this
is
too
much
fuss
perhaps
we
have
both
changed
was
you
who
began
it
it
how
can
one
tell
began
it
he
persisted
was
a
time
when
you
went
white
like
paper
when
we
met
and
your
eyes
went
black
now
i
might
be
a
sheep
in
a
field
she
was
standing
up
ready
to
go
gets
used
to
things
she
said
have
never
been
used
to
you
he
muttered
and
she
knew
that
telling
this
truth
he
also
explained
a
good
deal
never
should
be
you
like
nobody
else
nobody
it
is
too
much
strain
she
murmured
slowly
well
it
is
you
who
have
said
it
i
had
made
up
my
mind
i
not
ungrateful
i
never
intended
to
say
a
word
she
smiled
this
was
the
first
remark
which
had
really
touched
her
she
found
it
so
offensive
that
a
smile
was
the
only
weapon
with
which
to
meet
it
know
that
mind
he
almost
shouted
nobody
like
you
yes
i
know
that
too
she
turned
to
him
with
a
silencing
sternness
tell
you
i
know
everything
the
old
groom
who
held
her
horse
nodded
with
satisfaction
when
he
helped
her
into
the
saddle
she
had
not
lost
her
spring
and
he
tightened
her
girths
in
a
leisurely
manner
and
arranged
her
skirt
with
the
care
due
to
a
fine
rider
and
a
lady
who
understood
a
horse
yet
one
who
was
always
ready
to
ask
an
old
man
advice
he
had
a
great
admiration
for
miss
mallett
and
conscious
of
it
and
rather
pathetically
glad
of
it
she
lingered
for
the
pleasure
of
talking
to
some
one
who
seemed
simple
and
untroubled
he
had
spent
all
his
life
on
the
sales
estate
and
she
wondered
whether
though
like
herself
of
a
limited
outward
experience
he
also
had
known
the
passions
of
love
and
disgust
and
shame
he
was
he
told
her
but
as
strong
as
ever
and
she
envied
him
to
be
with
the
turmoil
of
life
behind
him
yet
to
be
strong
enough
to
enjoy
the
peace
before
him
was
a
good
finale
to
existence
she
was
only
but
she
was
strong
too
and
she
felt
as
though
she
had
come
through
a
storm
battered
and
exhausted
but
whole
and
ready
for
the
calm
which
already
hovered
over
her
she
said
young
are
always
sorry
for
the
old
but
that
is
one
of
the
many
mistakes
they
make
i
think
it
must
be
the
best
time
of
all
you
have
them
that
cares
for
you
he
answered
that
was
where
her
own
happiness
would
break
down
there
were
her
stepsisters
who
would
probably
die
before
herself
there
was
henrietta
who
would
form
ties
of
her
own
and
there
was
no
one
else
if
she
had
had
less
faith
in
francis
sales
love
and
at
the
same
time
had
been
capable
of
pandering
to
it
she
might
have
had
his
devotion
for
her
old
age
the
devotion
of
a
somewhat
querulous
and
dull
old
man
now
she
had
not
even
that
to
hope
for
and
she
was
glad
she
had
always
wanted
the
best
of
everything
and
always
except
in
the
one
fatal
instance
refused
what
fell
below
her
standard
she
had
not
realized
until
now
that
francis
sales
had
always
been
below
it
she
had
at
least
tried
to
wrap
their
love
in
beauty
but
that
sort
of
beauty
was
not
enough
for
him
it
was
her
scruples
he
said
which
had
been
his
undoing
and
there
was
truth
in
that
but
she
had
to
remember
that
when
originally
she
had
disappointed
him
he
had
found
comfort
quickly
in
christabel
when
christabel
failed
him
he
had
returned
to
her
and
now
he
had
found
consolation
if
only
of
a
temporary
kind
in
some
one
else
when
would
he
seek
yet
another
victim
of
his
affection
and
his
griefs
he
was
she
thought
scornfully
a
man
who
needed
women
yet
she
knew
that
if
he
had
pleaded
with
her
saying
that
in
spite
of
everything
he
needed
her
she
would
have
listened
she
admitted
her
responsibility
it
would
always
be
present
to
her
for
she
had
that
kind
of
conscientiousness
and
having
once
helped
him
she
must
always
hold
herself
ready
to
do
it
again
the
chain
binding
them
was
not
altogether
broken
but
she
no
longer
felt
its
weight
she
had
a
lightness
of
spirit
unknown
for
years
the
anger
the
jealous
rage
and
the
disgust
had
vanished
with
a
completeness
which
made
her
doubt
their
short
existence
and
she
began
to
make
plans
for
a
new
life
there
was
no
reason
now
why
she
should
not
wander
all
over
the
world
yet
on
the
very
doorstep
of
nelson
lodge
she
found
a
reason
in
the
person
of
henrietta
flushed
and
gay
and
just
returned
from
a
tea
party
she
had
enjoyed
herself
immensely
but
her
head
ached
a
little
it
had
been
all
she
could
do
to
understand
the
brilliant
conversation
there
had
been
present
a
budding
poet
and
a
woman
painter
and
she
had
never
heard
people
talk
like
that
before
did
speak
at
all
except
to
charles
she
said
charles
was
there
i
thought
it
safer
not
to
talk
but
i
looked
as
bright
as
i
could
and
of
course
i
asked
for
cakes
and
things
they
all
ate
a
lot
i
was
glad
of
that
but
most
of
them
still
looked
hungry
at
the
end
and
charles
has
taken
tickets
for
me
for
the
concerts
next
to
him
in
a
special
corner
where
you
can
sometimes
hear
the
music
through
the
whispering
of
the
audience
that
what
he
says
henrietta
i
have
taken
tickets
for
you
too
you
but
perhaps
they
will
take
them
back
you
really
ca
sit
in
a
corner
with
charles
when
i
in
another
part
of
the
hall
i
well
charles
will
be
very
angry
but
he
have
to
put
up
with
it
if
you
explained
to
him
aunt
rose
he
understand
and
really
rather
sit
with
you
i
shall
be
able
to
look
at
people
and
if
i
crackle
my
programme
you
wo
glare
of
course
i
shall
try
not
to
will
you
explain
to
him
and
i
did
promise
to
go
to
a
concert
with
him
some
day
you
must
i
tell
him
that
too
are
you
afraid
of
him
henrietta
shouts
henrietta
said
i
sorry
for
him
and
i
do
like
him
very
much
i
feel
inclined
to
do
things
just
to
please
him
let
that
carry
you
too
far
what
i
afraid
of
not
him
exactly
but
me
did
suspect
you
of
such
tenderness
i
shall
have
to
look
after
you
wish
you
would
if
you
are
feeling
very
kind
some
day
perhaps
you
will
go
and
see
christabel
sales
she
has
promised
to
behave
herself
henrietta
expression
tightened
do
want
to
go
it
a
dreadful
place
know
rose
said
and
she
added
encouragingly
the
cat
has
gone
they
were
standing
together
in
the
hall
and
against
the
white
panelled
walls
the
figure
of
rose
in
the
austere
riding
habit
one
gauntletted
hand
holding
her
crop
the
other
resting
lightly
on
her
hip
had
an
heroic
aspect
like
a
statue
in
dark
marble
but
her
eyes
did
not
offer
the
blank
gaze
the
calm
effrontery
of
stone
they
looked
at
henrietta
with
something
like
appeal
against
this
obsession
of
the
cat
i
glad
the
cat
gone
henrietta
murmured
happened
to
it
rose
shook
her
head
disappeared
they
stared
at
each
other
until
henrietta
said
all
the
same
i
do
want
to
go
and
then
because
rose
would
not
help
her
out
she
was
obliged
to
say
mr
sales
her
voice
dropped
seen
him
since
i
hit
him
rose
turned
to
go
upstairs
should
think
too
much
of
that
do
think
it
matters
henrietta
looked
after
her
and
followed
her
for
a
step
think
i
may
go
her
voice
was
dull
under
her
effort
to
control
it
she
felt
that
the
stately
figure
moving
up
the
stairs
was
deliberately
leaving
her
to
face
a
danger
sanctioning
her
desire
to
meet
it
she
felt
her
fate
was
in
the
answer
made
by
rose
think
you
can
take
care
of
yourself
perfectly
well
henrietta
and
like
a
sigh
another
sentence
floated
from
the
landing
where
rose
stood
out
of
sight
are
not
like
me
this
was
a
mysterious
and
astonishing
remark
henrietta
did
not
understand
it
and
in
her
excited
realization
that
the
door
so
carefully
locked
by
her
own
hand
had
been
opened
aunt
rose
she
did
not
try
to
understand
it
aunt
rose
had
said
she
was
able
to
take
care
of
herself
and
it
was
true
but
honesty
and
a
weak
clinging
to
safety
urged
her
to
answer
you
see
you
see
i
do
want
to
do
it
these
words
were
not
uttered
she
stood
looking
up
towards
the
empty
landing
with
a
hand
pressed
against
her
heart
it
was
beating
fast
the
spirit
of
reginald
mallett
subdued
in
his
daughter
for
some
months
seemed
to
be
fluttering
in
her
breast
and
it
was
aunt
rose
who
had
waked
it
up
it
was
not
henrietta
fault
she
was
not
responsible
and
suddenly
the
ordinary
happiness
she
had
been
enjoying
was
transferred
into
an
irrational
joy
she
went
singing
up
the
stairs
and
rose
sitting
in
her
room
in
a
state
of
limpness
she
would
never
have
allowed
anybody
to
see
heard
a
sound
as
innocent
as
if
a
bird
had
waked
to
a
sunny
dawn
henrietta
sang
but
now
and
then
she
paused
and
became
grave
when
the
spirit
of
that
mother
who
lived
in
her
memory
more
and
more
dimly
as
though
she
had
died
when
henrietta
was
a
child
overcame
the
spirit
of
her
father
her
mission
was
to
be
one
of
kindness
to
christabel
sales
and
if
the
song
burst
out
again
if
adventure
came
in
her
way
could
she
refuse
it
she
would
refuse
nothing
the
song
ceased
short
of
sin
she
looked
at
herself
and
saw
a
solemn
feminine
edition
of
the
portrait
hanging
behind
her
on
the
wall
she
was
like
her
father
but
she
took
pride
in
her
greater
conscientiousness
her
vocabulary
was
larger
than
his
by
at
least
one
word
a
few
days
later
she
set
out
on
that
road
and
past
those
trees
which
had
been
the
safe
witnesses
of
so
much
of
rose
mallett
life
but
their
safeness
lay
in
their
constant
muteness
and
they
had
no
message
for
henrietta
walking
quickly
she
rehearsed
her
coming
meeting
with
francis
sales
but
when
she
actually
met
him
on
the
green
track
on
the
very
spot
where
rose
had
pulled
up
her
horse
in
amazement
at
the
scene
of
transformation
henrietta
like
rose
had
no
formal
greeting
for
him
she
said
trees
what
are
you
doing
with
them
them
into
gold
they
were
beautiful
are
lots
of
things
they
will
buy
she
moved
a
little
under
his
look
but
when
he
said
hard
up
she
became
interested
i
thought
you
were
frightfully
rich
you
ought
to
be
with
all
these
belongings
she
looked
round
at
the
fields
dotted
with
sheep
and
cattle
the
distant
chimneys
of
sales
hall
the
fallen
trees
and
the
team
of
horses
dragging
logs
under
the
guidance
of
workmen
in
their
shirt
sleeves
know
all
about
being
poor
she
said
i
do
suppose
we
mean
the
same
thing
by
the
word
i
been
so
poor
she
stopped
there
a
lot
of
excitement
about
it
i
used
to
hope
i
should
find
a
shilling
in
my
purse
that
i
forgotten
a
shilling
you
can
do
a
lot
with
a
shilling
at
least
i
can
wish
you
tell
me
how
you
have
got
it
that
the
beginning
you
have
got
it
so
you
ca
have
what
you
want
never
have
what
i
want
you
must
want
anything
yes
that
so
easy
she
descended
to
details
with
an
air
of
kindness
do
you
want
let
work
it
out
we
better
sit
on
the
wall
after
all
rather
lovely
without
the
trees
it
so
clear
and
the
air
so
blue
as
if
it
trying
to
make
up
now
tell
me
what
you
want
money
ca
buy
you
need
have
cut
down
the
trees
should
have
if
i
thought
you
care
she
said
softly
but
sharply
do
believe
that
for
a
moment
why
do
you
tell
the
truth
you
want
to
hear
it
not
sure
i
wait
while
you
make
up
your
mind
sitting
on
the
wall
his
feet
rested
easily
on
the
ground
while
hers
swung
free
and
while
he
seemed
to
loll
in
complete
indifference
she
was
conscious
of
a
tenseness
she
could
not
prevent
she
hated
her
enjoyment
of
his
manner
which
was
impudent
but
it
had
the
spice
of
danger
that
she
liked
and
it
was
in
defiance
of
the
one
and
encouragement
of
the
other
that
she
said
sure
you
would
never
talk
to
aunt
rose
like
that
should
never
give
your
aunt
rose
my
confidence
he
said
severely
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
a
warmth
of
satisfaction
and
she
asked
shortly
not
would
understand
you
human
devilish
lonely
well
you
know
my
circumstances
a
shadow
which
seemed
to
affect
the
brightness
of
the
autumn
day
even
deadening
the
clear
shouting
of
the
men
and
the
jingling
of
the
chains
attached
to
the
horses
passed
over
francis
sales
face
wants
a
friend
a
cry
of
genuine
bewilderment
came
from
henrietta
i
thought
you
were
so
fond
of
aunt
rose
from
sulky
contemplation
of
his
brown
boots
and
leggings
he
looked
at
her
his
eyes
of
a
light
yet
dense
blue
were
widely
opened
makes
you
think
that
did
she
tell
you
henrietta
lip
curled
derisively
it
was
you
when
you
looked
at
her
and
now
you
have
told
me
again
she
had
a
moment
of
thoughtful
contempt
for
the
blundering
of
men
there
was
charles
who
always
seemed
to
wander
in
a
mist
and
now
this
francis
sales
who
revealed
what
he
wished
to
hide
he
was
mentally
inferior
to
jenkins
who
had
a
quickness
of
wit
a
vulgar
sharpness
of
tongue
which
kept
the
mind
on
the
alert
but
physically
she
had
shrunk
from
proximity
while
that
of
francis
sales
in
his
tweeds
and
his
shining
boots
who
seemed
as
clean
as
the
air
surrounding
him
had
an
attraction
actually
enhanced
by
his
heaviness
of
spirit
he
was
like
a
child
possessed
consciously
or
unconsciously
of
a
weapon
and
her
sense
of
her
own
superiority
was
corrected
by
fear
of
his
strength
and
of
the
subtle
weakness
in
her
own
blood
she
heard
a
murmur
has
treated
me
very
badly
i
known
her
all
my
life
well
henrietta
with
a
gentleness
he
appreciated
and
a
cleverness
he
missed
said
commiseratingly
would
let
you
take
her
hand
in
the
wood
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
look
here
henrietta
what
do
you
mean
there
had
been
so
many
occasions
of
the
kind
that
it
was
impossible
to
know
to
which
one
she
referred
and
looking
back
his
past
seemed
to
be
blocked
with
frustrations
and
petty
torments
do
you
mean
he
repeated
mind
is
some
gossip
he
muttered
among
the
squirrels
and
the
rabbits
woods
are
full
of
eyes
and
ears
he
said
eyes
and
ears
will
have
to
find
another
home
there
will
soon
be
no
wood
left
so
he
had
tried
to
take
aunt
rose
hand
in
this
wood
too
she
laughed
with
the
pretty
trill
which
made
her
laughter
a
new
thing
every
time
do
see
the
joke
he
grumbled
she
turned
to
him
do
think
you
laughed
very
much
in
your
life
you
always
being
sorry
for
yourself
have
been
very
unfortunate
he
replied
you
are
again
why
do
you
tell
yourself
you
lucky
not
to
squint
or
turn
in
your
toes
you
be
much
more
miserable
then
much
but
thinking
yourself
unfortunate
when
you
not
is
a
pleasant
occupation
do
you
know
know
a
lot
henrietta
said
i
never
thought
myself
unfortunate
so
i
was
noble
sales
said
sourly
i
told
you
it
was
exciting
to
be
poor
you
not
poor
enough
a
new
dress
she
went
on
clasping
her
hands
of
all
i
had
to
save
up
in
pennies
she
turned
accusingly
do
believe
it
must
have
taken
a
long
time
did
but
not
so
long
as
you
would
think
because
it
cost
so
little
in
the
end
i
saved
up
and
then
i
looked
in
the
shop
windows
and
then
i
talked
about
it
for
days
and
then
i
bought
the
stuff
mother
cut
out
the
dress
and
then
i
made
it
the
result
was
charming
thought
so
then
now
i
know
it
was
but
at
the
time
i
was
happy
he
said
very
interesting
but
it
does
help
me
i
could
help
you
if
you
told
me
your
troubles
i
should
know
how
my
troubles
would
be
a
help
i
am
then
the
good
he
said
desert
me
too
if
you
good
if
that
the
stipulation
he
stood
up
his
tone
which
might
have
been
provocative
was
simply
bored
she
knew
she
had
been
dull
and
her
lip
trembled
with
mortification
of
course
she
cried
gaily
when
she
had
mastered
that
weakness
caroline
warned
me
against
you
this
very
afternoon
she
said
but
never
mind
i
not
going
to
repeat
her
remarks
and
anyhow
aunt
sophia
said
they
were
not
true
aunt
rose
henrietta
said
thoughtfully
not
there
i
do
suppose
either
of
them
is
right
and
now
i
going
to
see
mrs
sales
he
ran
after
her
i
should
tell
her
you
seen
me
she
frowned
do
like
that
for
her
sake
henrietta
turned
away
without
a
word
but
she
pondered
as
she
went
on
the
dangerous
likeness
between
right
and
wrong
and
the
horrible
facility
with
which
they
could
be
with
which
they
had
to
be
interchanged
one
became
bewildered
one
became
lost
she
felt
herself
being
forced
into
a
false
position
she
might
not
be
able
to
get
out
aunt
rose
had
sent
her
francis
sales
was
conspiring
with
her
she
made
her
father
gesture
of
helplessness
it
was
not
her
fault
but
she
made
up
her
mind
she
would
never
allow
francis
sales
to
find
her
dull
again
for
that
was
unfair
to
herself
rose
mallett
who
had
always
accepted
conditions
and
not
criticized
them
found
herself
in
those
days
forced
to
a
puzzled
consideration
of
life
it
seemed
an
unnecessary
invention
on
the
part
of
a
creator
a
freak
which
on
contemplation
he
must
surely
regret
she
was
not
tired
of
her
own
existence
but
she
wondered
what
it
was
for
and
what
possessing
it
she
could
do
with
it
her
one
attempt
at
usefulness
had
been
foiled
and
though
she
had
never
consciously
wanted
anything
to
do
she
felt
the
need
now
that
she
was
deprived
of
it
she
passed
her
days
in
the
order
and
elegance
of
nelson
lodge
in
a
monotonous
satisfaction
of
the
eye
listening
to
the
familiar
chatter
of
caroline
and
sophia
dressing
herself
with
tireless
care
and
refusing
to
regret
her
past
nevertheless
it
had
been
wasted
and
the
only
occupation
of
her
present
was
her
anxiety
for
francis
sales
she
could
not
rid
herself
of
that
claim
begun
so
long
ago
she
had
to
accept
the
inactive
responsibility
which
in
another
would
have
resolved
itself
into
earnest
prayer
but
which
in
her
was
a
stoical
endurance
of
possibilities
what
was
he
doing
what
would
he
do
she
knew
he
could
not
stand
alone
she
knew
she
must
continue
to
hold
herself
ready
for
his
service
but
a
prisoner
fastened
to
a
chain
does
not
find
much
solace
in
counting
the
links
and
that
was
all
she
had
to
do
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
moved
rather
like
a
ghost
up
and
down
the
stairs
about
the
landing
in
the
delicate
silence
of
her
bedroom
that
she
sat
at
the
and
heard
the
strangely
aimless
talk
of
human
beings
she
supposed
there
were
countless
women
like
herself
unoccupied
and
lonely
yet
her
pride
resented
the
idea
there
was
only
one
rose
mallett
there
was
no
one
else
with
just
her
past
with
the
same
mental
pictures
and
her
peculiar
isolation
and
if
she
had
been
a
vainer
woman
she
would
have
added
that
no
other
woman
offered
the
same
kind
of
beauty
to
a
world
in
need
of
it
her
obvious
consolation
was
in
the
presence
of
henrietta
though
she
had
little
companionship
to
give
her
aunt
and
no
suspicion
that
rose
almost
unawares
began
to
transfer
her
interests
to
the
girl
to
set
her
mind
on
happiness
she
would
take
her
abroad
and
let
her
see
the
world
caroline
sniffed
at
the
suggestion
sophia
sighed
world
the
same
everywhere
caroline
said
you
know
one
man
you
know
them
all
if
you
know
a
great
many
you
will
know
one
all
the
better
however
she
smiled
in
the
way
of
which
her
stepsisters
were
afraid
was
thinking
of
men
where
you
so
unnatural
was
thinking
of
places
cities
and
mountains
and
plains
get
the
plague
or
be
run
away
with
by
brigands
think
henrietta
and
i
would
rather
like
the
brigands
we
must
avoid
the
plague
caroline
went
on
your
complexions
ruined
wish
you
would
stay
at
home
sophia
said
and
i
are
getting
old
sophia
i
go
myself
for
twopence
but
i
better
wait
here
and
get
the
ransom
money
ready
and
then
james
batty
and
i
can
start
out
together
with
a
bag
of
it
she
laughed
loudly
at
the
prospect
of
setting
forth
with
the
respectable
james
it
be
the
first
elopement
i
planned
either
when
i
was
eighteen
i
set
my
mind
on
getting
out
of
my
bedroom
window
with
a
bundle
no
of
course
i
never
told
you
sophia
you
would
have
run
in
hysterics
to
the
general
but
there
was
never
one
among
them
all
who
was
worth
the
inconvenience
so
i
gave
it
up
i
always
had
more
sense
than
sentiment
she
sighed
with
regret
for
the
legions
of
disappointed
and
fictitious
lovers
waiting
under
windows
with
which
her
mind
was
peopled
one
she
repeated
no
one
took
any
notice
sophia
drooping
her
heavy
head
was
thinking
of
brigands
in
a
far
country
and
of
caroline
and
herself
left
in
nelson
lodge
without
rose
and
without
henrietta
if
they
really
went
away
she
determined
to
tell
henrietta
the
story
of
her
lover
lest
she
should
die
and
the
tale
be
unrecorded
she
wanted
somebody
to
know
she
would
tell
henrietta
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
among
the
bags
and
boxes
he
had
gone
to
america
and
died
there
and
that
continent
was
both
sacred
to
her
and
abhorrent
go
to
america
she
murmured
not
caroline
demanded
the
place
they
ought
to
go
to
lots
of
millionaires
rose
reassured
sophia
it
is
only
an
idea
i
have
said
a
word
to
henrietta
henrietta
showed
no
enthusiasm
for
the
suggestion
she
liked
radstowe
and
there
was
the
battys
ball
it
would
be
a
pity
to
miss
that
she
must
certainly
not
miss
that
said
caroline
and
sophia
and
what
was
she
going
to
wear
they
had
better
go
upstairs
at
once
to
the
elder
ladies
room
and
see
what
could
be
done
with
caroline
pink
satin
she
had
only
worn
it
once
years
ago
nobody
would
remember
it
and
trimmed
with
some
of
her
mother
lace
the
big
flounce
and
the
fichu
it
would
be
a
different
thing
sophia
could
wear
her
apricot
along
henrietta
come
along
rose
we
must
really
get
this
settled
they
went
upstairs
caroline
moving
with
heavy
dignity
but
keeping
up
her
head
as
she
had
been
taught
in
her
youth
nothing
was
more
unbecoming
than
ducking
the
head
and
sticking
out
the
back
sophia
went
slowly
holding
to
the
balustrade
so
very
slowly
that
henrietta
did
not
attempt
to
start
she
said
softly
to
rose
slowly
she
goes
i
never
noticed
it
before
always
goes
upstairs
like
that
rose
said
is
not
natural
to
her
to
hurry
henrietta
followed
and
found
sophia
panting
a
little
on
the
landing
she
laid
hold
of
her
niece
arm
little
out
of
breath
she
whispered
say
anything
dear
child
to
caroline
she
like
to
be
reminded
of
our
age
they
went
into
the
bedroom
and
rose
drifting
into
her
own
room
heard
the
opening
of
the
great
wardrobe
doors
she
would
be
called
in
presently
for
her
advice
but
there
would
be
a
lot
of
talk
and
many
reminiscences
before
she
was
needed
she
stood
by
the
fire
which
giving
the
only
light
to
the
room
threw
golden
patches
on
the
white
lying
across
a
chair
and
made
the
buckles
on
her
shoes
sparkle
like
diamonds
she
was
wondering
why
henrietta
eyes
had
darkened
as
though
with
fear
at
the
idea
of
going
away
she
had
been
very
quick
in
veiling
them
and
her
voice
too
had
been
quick
a
little
tremulous
there
was
more
than
the
battys
ball
in
her
desire
to
stay
in
radstowe
was
it
charles
whom
she
was
both
to
leave
afterwards
perhaps
in
the
spring
she
had
said
it
would
be
nice
to
go
it
was
kind
of
aunt
rose
and
aunt
rose
gazing
down
at
the
fire
controlled
her
longing
to
escape
from
this
place
too
full
of
memories
she
would
not
leave
henrietta
who
had
to
be
cared
for
perhaps
protected
she
would
not
persuade
her
who
had
to
be
happy
but
she
felt
a
sinking
of
the
heart
which
was
almost
physical
she
rested
both
hands
on
the
mantelshelf
and
on
them
her
weight
she
felt
as
though
she
could
not
go
on
like
this
for
ever
she
who
apparently
had
no
ties
was
never
free
she
had
the
duties
without
the
joys
and
for
these
few
minutes
before
a
knock
came
at
the
door
she
allowed
herself
the
relief
of
melancholy
she
was
incapable
of
tears
but
she
wished
she
could
cry
bitterly
and
for
a
long
time
the
knock
was
henrietta
she
entered
a
little
timidly
aunt
rose
was
not
free
with
invitations
to
her
room
and
to
henrietta
it
was
a
beautiful
and
mysterious
place
she
had
a
childlike
pleasure
in
the
silver
and
glass
on
the
in
glimpses
of
exquisite
garments
and
slippers
worn
to
the
shape
of
aunt
rose
slim
foot
and
aunt
rose
herself
was
like
some
fairy
princess
growing
old
and
no
less
lovely
in
captivity
but
that
dark
straight
figure
splashed
by
the
firelight
reminded
her
of
words
uttered
by
christabel
she
had
said
that
all
henrietta
aunts
were
witches
and
for
the
first
time
the
girl
agreed
in
the
other
room
brilliantly
lighted
caroline
and
sophia
were
bending
somewhat
greedily
over
a
mass
of
silks
and
satins
and
laces
their
cheeks
flushed
round
the
dabs
of
rouge
their
fingers
active
yet
inept
fumbling
in
what
might
have
been
a
brew
for
the
working
of
spells
and
here
straight
as
a
tree
aunt
rose
looked
into
the
fire
as
though
she
could
see
the
future
in
its
red
heart
but
her
voice
very
clear
had
a
reassuring
quality
it
was
not
henrietta
thought
a
witch
voice
witches
mumbled
and
screeched
and
aunt
rose
spoke
like
water
falling
from
a
height
in
henrietta
is
the
consultation
over
has
hardly
begun
what
a
lot
of
clothes
they
have
and
boxes
of
lace
boxes
i
think
you
will
have
to
decide
for
them
and
aunt
caroline
snubs
aunt
sophia
all
the
time
they
send
you
to
fetch
me
but
we
need
go
back
yet
need
we
aunt
caroline
wants
to
wear
her
emeralds
but
she
says
they
will
look
vulgar
with
pink
satin
there
some
lovely
grey
stuff
like
a
cobweb
she
says
it
was
in
her
mother
trousseau
and
i
think
she
ought
to
wear
that
but
she
says
she
is
going
to
keep
it
until
she
old
she
never
wear
it
she
will
never
make
such
an
admission
she
wo
let
aunt
sophia
have
it
because
she
says
it
would
make
her
look
like
a
dusty
broom
and
it
would
you
know
she
really
very
funny
sometimes
funny
we
queer
people
henrietta
we
and
i
more
theirs
than
yours
far
as
blood
goes
yes
she
spoke
very
quietly
but
she
felt
a
great
desire
to
assert
for
once
her
own
claims
instead
of
accepting
those
of
others
she
wanted
to
tell
henrietta
that
in
return
for
the
secret
care
the
growing
affection
she
was
giving
she
demanded
confidence
and
love
but
she
had
never
asked
for
anything
in
her
life
she
had
taken
coolly
much
she
could
easily
have
done
without
admiration
and
respect
and
the
material
advantages
to
which
she
had
been
born
but
she
had
asked
for
nothing
cruelly
conscious
of
all
that
lay
in
the
gift
of
henrietta
who
sat
in
a
low
chair
her
chin
on
the
joined
fingers
of
her
hands
rose
continued
to
look
at
the
fire
mean
i
really
more
like
you
henrietta
said
i
i
like
my
father
and
she
added
softly
terribly
henrietta
moved
her
feet
i
do
know
wish
you
tell
me
was
queer
you
said
we
all
were
and
i
a
mallett
too
all
do
you
think
we
ought
to
go
and
see
about
the
dresses
now
aunt
rose
they
bothering
me
to
wear
white
the
only
thing
for
a
young
girl
but
i
want
to
wear
yellow
do
you
think
i
might
rose
who
had
felt
herself
on
the
brink
of
confidences
as
though
she
peered
over
a
cliff
and
watched
the
mists
clear
to
show
the
secret
valley
underneath
now
saw
the
clouds
thicken
hopelessly
and
retreated
from
her
position
with
an
effort
yes
certainly
you
will
look
like
a
marigold
henrietta
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
going
to
say
but
she
wanted
to
detain
the
girl
for
a
little
longer
she
hoped
for
another
chance
of
drawing
nearer
wait
a
minute
she
moved
to
her
smiling
at
what
she
was
about
to
do
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
going
to
bribe
the
girl
to
love
her
but
she
was
only
yielding
to
the
pathetic
human
desire
to
give
something
tangible
since
the
intangible
was
ignored
i
was
she
said
father
gave
me
a
present
when
you
were
rose
excused
him
did
know
each
other
very
well
he
was
a
great
deal
from
home
but
he
remembered
my
birthday
and
he
gave
me
this
necklace
i
think
it
beautiful
but
i
never
wear
it
now
and
i
think
you
may
like
to
have
it
here
it
is
in
its
own
box
and
with
the
card
he
wrote
a
jewel
for
a
rose
holding
it
in
her
cupped
hands
henrietta
murmured
with
delight
i
have
it
really
how
lovely
and
may
i
have
the
card
too
he
did
say
nice
things
are
you
sure
you
can
spare
the
card
i
expect
he
admired
you
very
much
he
liked
beautiful
women
my
mother
was
pretty
too
but
i
do
believe
he
ever
gave
her
anything
except
a
and
he
had
to
give
her
that
henrietta
well
his
daughter
shall
have
all
he
gave
me
you
sure
you
do
want
it
what
are
the
stones
and
diamonds
but
so
small
that
you
can
wear
them
and
diamonds
oh
and
henrietta
clasping
it
round
her
neck
and
surveying
herself
by
the
candles
rose
had
lighted
said
earnestly
i
do
hope
he
paid
for
it
this
was
the
first
thought
of
reginald
mallett
daughter
rose
was
horrified
into
laughter
which
seemed
hysterically
continuous
to
henrietta
and
through
it
rose
cried
tenderly
you
poor
child
you
poor
child
henrietta
did
not
laugh
she
said
gravely
the
same
i
glad
i
had
him
for
a
father
nobody
but
he
would
have
chosen
a
thing
like
this
he
had
such
taste
she
looked
at
her
aunt
do
hope
i
have
some
taste
too
hope
you
have
rose
said
with
equal
gravity
she
laughed
no
longer
are
many
kinds
and
though
he
knew
how
to
choose
an
ornament
he
made
mistakes
in
other
ways
henrietta
unclasped
the
necklace
and
laid
it
down
she
looked
indeed
remarkably
like
her
father
her
eyes
flashed
above
her
angry
mouth
mean
my
mother
henrietta
how
could
i
i
did
not
know
your
mother
and
from
the
little
you
have
told
us
i
believe
she
was
too
good
for
him
can
i
tell
you
more
henrietta
protested
i
know
what
you
would
be
thinking
you
would
be
thinking
she
was
common
aunt
caroline
does
she
does
i
do
know
how
she
dare
no
i
wo
have
the
necklace
must
believe
what
i
say
henrietta
your
mother
was
not
the
only
woman
in
your
father
life
and
i
was
referring
to
the
others
need
not
speak
of
them
to
me
henrietta
said
with
dignity
wo
do
so
again
that
perhaps
is
where
my
own
taste
failed
she
decided
to
put
out
no
more
feelers
for
henrietta
thoughts
it
was
what
she
would
have
resented
bitterly
herself
and
it
did
no
good
she
was
not
clever
at
this
unpractised
art
and
she
told
herself
that
if
her
own
affection
could
not
tell
her
what
she
wished
to
know
the
information
would
be
useless
moreover
she
had
henrietta
word
for
it
that
she
was
terribly
like
her
father
put
on
the
necklace
again
it
suits
you
better
than
it
does
me
so
well
that
we
can
pretend
he
really
chose
it
for
you
henrietta
said
fingering
it
again
you
promise
you
never
think
anything
horrid
about
my
mother
worst
i
have
ever
thought
of
her
rose
said
lightly
envying
her
for
her
daughter
she
saw
henrietta
mouth
open
inelegantly
oh
but
you
not
old
enough
feel
very
old
sometimes
thought
you
were
when
i
first
saw
you
henrietta
said
looking
in
the
glass
and
swaying
her
body
to
make
the
diamonds
glitter
now
i
know
you
never
will
be
because
it
only
ugly
people
who
get
old
when
your
hair
is
white
you
be
like
a
queen
now
you
a
princess
though
mrs
sales
says
you
a
witch
oh
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
that
it
was
a
long
time
ago
she
is
never
disagreeable
now
i
going
to
see
her
again
wish
you
would
go
in
the
morning
henrietta
the
afternoons
get
dark
so
soon
and
the
road
is
lonely
does
like
visitors
in
the
morning
henrietta
said
love
this
necklace
could
i
wear
it
to
the
dance
depends
on
the
dress
if
you
are
really
to
look
like
a
marigold
you
must
wear
no
ornaments
if
you
had
yellow
tulle
and
rose
took
pencil
and
paper
and
made
a
rough
design
talking
with
enthusiasm
meanwhile
for
like
all
the
malletts
she
loved
clothes
the
next
day
caroline
had
to
stay
in
bed
she
had
been
feverish
all
night
and
sophia
appeared
in
rose
bedroom
early
in
the
morning
her
great
plait
of
hair
swinging
free
her
face
yellow
with
anxiety
and
sleeplessness
and
lack
of
powder
to
inform
her
stepsister
that
dear
caroline
was
very
ill
they
must
have
the
doctor
directly
after
breakfast
sophia
was
afraid
caroline
was
going
to
die
she
had
groaned
in
the
night
when
she
thought
sophia
was
asleep
deceived
her
sophia
said
hope
it
was
wrong
but
i
knew
she
would
be
easier
if
she
thought
i
slept
now
she
says
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
her
and
she
wants
to
get
up
but
that
her
courage
caroline
was
not
allowed
to
rise
and
after
breakfast
and
an
hour
with
sophia
behind
the
locked
door
she
announced
her
readiness
to
see
the
doctor
who
diagnosed
nothing
more
serious
than
a
chill
she
was
very
much
disgusted
with
his
order
to
stay
in
bed
she
had
not
had
a
day
in
bed
for
years
she
believed
people
were
only
ill
when
they
wanted
to
be
and
as
she
did
not
wish
to
be
she
was
not
she
had
no
resource
but
to
be
unpleasant
to
sophia
to
the
silently
devoted
susan
and
to
rose
who
had
intended
to
go
to
sales
hall
with
henrietta
she
was
not
able
to
do
that
but
later
in
the
afternoon
she
set
out
to
meet
her
so
that
she
might
have
company
for
part
of
the
dark
way
home
afterwards
she
could
never
make
up
her
mind
whether
she
was
glad
or
sorry
she
had
gone
she
had
expected
to
meet
henrietta
within
a
mile
or
two
of
the
bridge
and
the
further
she
went
without
a
sight
of
the
small
figure
walking
towards
her
the
more
necessary
it
became
to
proceed
but
she
felt
a
deadly
sickness
of
this
road
she
loved
each
individual
tree
each
bush
and
field
and
the
view
from
every
point
but
the
whole
thing
she
hated
it
was
the
personification
of
mistake
disappointment
and
slow
disillusion
but
now
it
was
all
shrouded
in
darkness
and
she
seemed
to
be
walking
on
nothing
through
nothing
and
towards
nothing
she
herself
was
nothing
and
she
thought
of
nothing
though
now
and
then
a
little
wave
of
anxiety
washed
over
her
where
was
henrietta
she
became
genuinely
alarmed
when
in
the
hollow
between
the
track
and
the
rising
fields
she
saw
a
fire
and
discovered
by
its
light
a
caravan
a
cart
a
huddle
of
dark
figures
a
tethered
pony
and
heard
the
barking
of
dogs
there
were
gipsies
camping
in
the
sheltered
dip
if
henrietta
had
walked
into
their
midst
she
might
have
been
robbed
she
would
certainly
have
been
frightened
and
rose
stood
still
listening
intently
the
cleared
space
where
the
wood
had
been
stretched
away
to
a
line
of
trees
edging
the
main
road
and
above
it
there
was
a
greenish
colour
in
the
sky
there
was
not
a
sound
but
what
came
from
the
encampment
down
there
the
fire
glowed
like
some
enormous
and
mysterious
jewel
and
before
it
figures
which
had
become
poetical
and
endowed
with
some
haggard
kind
of
beauty
passed
and
vanished
they
might
have
been
employed
in
the
rites
of
some
weird
worship
and
the
movements
which
were
in
reality
connected
with
the
cooking
of
some
snared
bird
or
rabbit
seemed
to
have
a
processional
quality
the
fire
was
replenished
the
stew
was
stirred
there
was
a
faint
clatter
of
tin
plates
and
a
sharp
cracking
of
twigs
a
figure
passed
before
the
fire
with
extraordinary
gestures
and
slid
into
the
night
another
figure
appeared
and
followed
its
predecessor
smoke
rose
and
a
savoury
smell
floated
on
the
air
suddenly
a
child
wailed
and
rose
had
the
ghastly
impression
that
it
was
the
child
who
was
in
the
pot
cautiously
she
stepped
into
the
clearing
the
dogs
barked
again
and
she
ran
swiftly
as
silently
as
possible
leaping
over
the
small
hummocks
of
heath
dodging
the
brushwood
and
finding
a
certain
pleasure
in
her
own
speed
and
in
her
fear
that
the
dogs
would
soon
be
snapping
at
her
heels
if
she
did
not
find
henrietta
on
the
road
she
would
go
on
to
sales
hall
very
high
up
clouds
floated
as
though
patrolling
the
sky
they
found
in
her
fleeting
figure
something
which
must
be
watched
she
was
breathless
and
strangely
happy
when
she
reached
the
road
she
was
pleased
at
her
capacity
for
running
and
her
dull
trouble
seemed
to
have
lifted
to
have
risen
from
her
mind
and
gone
off
to
join
the
clouds
she
laughed
a
little
and
dropped
down
on
a
stone
and
above
the
hurried
beating
of
her
heart
she
heard
fainter
more
despairing
the
cry
of
the
gipsy
child
is
cooked
yet
she
thought
there
was
a
deeper
silence
and
she
imagined
a
horrible
dipping
into
the
pot
a
loud
and
ravenous
eating
for
a
few
minutes
she
forgot
her
quest
conscious
of
a
happy
loss
of
personality
in
this
solitary
place
feeling
herself
merged
into
the
night
looking
up
at
the
patrolling
clouds
which
having
lost
her
had
moved
on
she
sat
in
the
darkness
until
she
heard
very
far
off
the
beat
of
a
horse
hoofs
the
rumble
of
wheels
she
remembered
then
that
she
had
to
find
henrietta
the
road
towards
sales
hall
was
nowhere
blurred
by
a
figure
there
was
no
sound
of
footsteps
and
the
noise
of
the
approaching
horse
and
cart
was
distantly
symbolic
of
human
activity
and
it
made
her
think
of
lights
and
food
she
looked
back
and
not
many
yards
away
two
figures
stepped
from
the
sheltering
trees
by
the
roadside
on
the
whiteness
of
the
road
they
were
clear
and
unmistakable
their
arms
were
outstretched
and
their
hands
were
joined
and
as
she
looked
the
two
forms
became
one
separated
and
parted
the
feet
of
henrietta
went
tapping
down
the
road
and
for
a
moment
francis
stood
and
watched
her
then
he
turned
he
struck
a
match
and
rose
saw
his
face
and
hands
illuminated
like
a
paper
lantern
the
match
made
a
short
brilliant
journey
in
the
air
and
fell
extinguished
he
had
lighted
his
pipe
and
was
advancing
towards
her
she
too
advanced
and
stopped
a
few
feet
from
him
and
at
once
she
said
calmly
that
henrietta
i
came
to
find
her
he
stammered
something
she
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
lie
yet
at
the
same
time
she
knew
that
to
hear
him
lie
would
give
her
pleasure
it
would
be
like
the
final
shattering
and
trampling
of
her
love
but
he
did
not
lie
henrietta
he
said
sullenly
are
gipsies
in
the
hollow
i
shall
turn
them
out
them
stay
there
she
said
she
knew
not
why
all
thieves
he
muttered
neither
spoke
it
was
like
a
dream
to
be
standing
there
with
him
and
hearing
henrietta
footsteps
tapping
into
silence
then
rose
asked
in
genuine
bewilderment
did
you
let
her
go
home
alone
why
did
you
leave
her
here
would
have
me
she
safe
now
and
raising
his
voice
he
almost
cried
should
let
her
come
here
it
was
a
cry
for
help
he
was
appealing
to
her
again
he
was
the
victim
of
his
habit
she
smiled
and
wondered
if
her
pale
face
was
as
clear
to
him
as
his
was
to
her
i
should
not
she
said
slowly
should
not
one
does
nothing
all
one
life
but
make
mistakes
her
chief
feeling
at
that
moment
was
one
of
she
moved
away
without
another
word
going
slowly
so
that
she
should
not
overtake
henrietta
henrietta
was
going
very
fast
impelled
by
the
fury
of
her
thoughts
and
she
forgot
to
be
afraid
of
the
lonely
country
for
she
felt
herself
still
wrapped
in
the
dangerous
safety
of
that
man
embrace
and
the
darkness
through
which
she
went
was
still
the
palpitating
darkness
which
had
fallen
over
her
at
his
touch
the
thing
had
been
bound
to
happen
she
had
been
watching
its
approach
and
pretending
it
was
not
there
and
now
it
had
arrived
and
she
was
giddy
with
excitement
inspired
with
a
sense
of
triumph
tremulous
with
apprehension
her
thoughts
were
not
of
her
lover
as
an
individual
but
of
the
situation
as
a
whole
here
she
was
henrietta
mallett
from
banks
the
chief
figure
in
a
drama
and
an
unrepentant
sinner
she
could
not
help
it
she
loved
him
he
needed
her
since
that
day
when
she
had
offered
him
friendship
and
help
he
had
been
depending
on
her
more
and
more
a
big
man
like
a
neglected
baby
she
had
strenuously
fixed
her
mind
on
the
babyish
side
of
him
but
all
the
time
her
senses
had
been
attracted
by
the
man
and
now
by
the
mere
physical
experience
of
the
force
of
his
arms
she
could
never
see
him
as
a
child
again
she
clung
to
the
idea
of
helping
him
to
the
thought
of
his
misfortunes
for
that
was
imperative
but
she
was
now
conscious
of
her
fewer
years
her
infinitely
smaller
bodily
strength
the
limitations
of
her
sex
and
suddenly
as
she
moved
swiftly
hardly
feeling
the
ground
under
her
feet
she
began
to
cry
with
emotion
with
fear
and
joy
what
was
going
to
happen
to
her
she
loved
him
she
could
still
feel
the
violence
of
his
clasp
the
roughness
of
his
coat
on
her
cheeks
the
iron
of
his
hands
so
distinctly
that
it
seemed
to
have
happened
only
a
moment
ago
yet
she
was
nearly
home
she
could
see
the
lights
of
the
bridge
as
though
swung
on
a
cord
across
the
gulf
and
she
dried
her
eyes
she
was
exhausted
and
hungry
and
when
she
had
passed
over
the
river
she
made
her
way
to
a
shop
where
chocolates
could
be
bought
she
knew
their
comforting
and
sustaining
properties
it
was
unromantic
but
hunger
asserts
itself
in
spite
of
love
it
was
getting
late
and
the
shop
was
empty
but
for
one
assistant
and
a
tall
young
man
this
was
charles
batty
taking
a
great
deal
of
trouble
over
his
purchase
for
spread
before
him
on
the
counter
was
an
assortment
of
large
chocolate
boxes
adorned
with
bows
of
ribbon
and
pictures
of
lovers
leaning
over
stiles
and
maidens
caressing
dogs
do
like
these
pictures
henrietta
heard
him
mutter
bashfully
one
with
roses
roses
are
always
suitable
he
said
want
a
big
white
box
with
crimson
ribbon
henrietta
stepped
up
to
his
side
help
you
choose
she
said
he
started
stared
forgot
to
take
off
his
hat
he
gazed
at
her
with
the
absorption
of
some
connoisseur
looking
at
the
perfect
thing
he
has
dreamed
of
he
looked
without
greed
and
with
a
sort
of
ecstasy
which
left
his
face
expressionless
and
embarrassed
henrietta
in
the
presence
of
the
arch
girl
behind
the
counter
charles
waked
up
want
a
white
one
he
repeated
crimson
ribbon
no
pictures
the
assistant
went
away
and
he
turned
to
henrietta
for
you
he
said
do
speak
so
loud
do
care
but
i
suppose
you
ashamed
of
me
yes
of
course
that
it
be
silly
henrietta
said
do
be
quick
because
i
want
some
chocolates
myself
with
the
large
box
white
and
and
wrapped
in
paper
under
his
arm
he
waited
until
she
was
served
and
then
they
walked
together
down
the
street
made
brilliant
with
the
lights
of
many
little
shops
is
for
you
he
said
i
carry
it
this
is
the
way
home
they
turned
back
into
the
dimmer
road
bordering
the
green
suppose
you
would
walk
round
the
hill
do
mind
she
felt
as
she
might
have
done
in
the
company
of
some
large
protective
dog
he
was
there
saving
her
from
the
fear
of
molestation
but
there
was
no
need
to
speak
to
him
it
was
almost
impossible
to
think
consecutively
of
him
yet
she
did
remind
herself
that
a
very
long
time
ago
when
she
was
young
he
had
said
wonderful
things
to
her
she
had
forgotten
that
fact
in
the
stir
of
these
last
days
got
these
chocolates
for
you
he
said
again
thought
perhaps
that
was
the
kind
of
thing
i
ought
to
do
i
do
know
and
you
ask
people
because
they
laugh
why
did
you
come
to
tea
on
sunday
ca
come
every
sunday
course
you
can
considering
i
engaged
to
you
it
only
proper
do
know
what
you
mean
he
said
may
not
be
engaged
to
me
but
i
engaged
to
you
that
what
i
decided
she
laughed
find
it
rather
dull
i
afraid
he
said
can
do
things
for
you
she
was
struck
by
that
simple
statement
spoilt
by
his
next
words
these
chocolates
he
was
very
insistent
about
the
chocolates
and
proud
of
his
idea
she
thanked
him
i
do
want
you
to
give
me
things
ca
stop
me
i
doing
it
all
the
time
they
had
reached
the
highest
point
of
the
hill
and
they
halted
at
the
railing
on
the
cliff
edge
below
them
the
blackness
of
earth
gave
way
to
the
blackness
of
air
and
the
shining
blackness
of
water
and
slowly
the
opposing
cliff
cleared
itself
from
a
formless
mass
into
the
hardly
seen
shapes
of
rock
and
tree
here
was
beauty
here
was
something
permanent
in
the
midst
of
change
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
hand
of
peace
were
laid
on
henrietta
for
a
moment
the
episode
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
and
the
problem
it
involved
took
their
tiny
places
in
the
universe
instead
of
the
large
ones
in
her
life
and
strangely
enough
it
was
charles
batty
who
loomed
up
big
as
though
he
had
some
odd
fellowship
with
immensity
and
beauty
do
you
give
me
she
asked
do
want
it
you
know
but
tell
me
told
you
that
night
when
you
listened
and
took
it
all
i
think
i
can
say
it
again
but
you
not
to
misunderstand
me
and
you
must
go
on
giving
and
getting
nothing
back
just
what
i
can
do
not
many
people
could
but
i
can
perhaps
it
the
only
way
i
can
be
great
like
an
artist
giving
his
work
to
a
world
that
does
care
the
quick
sense
she
had
to
serve
her
instead
of
knowledge
and
to
make
her
unconsciously
subtle
detected
his
danger
in
the
words
and
some
lack
of
homage
to
herself
you
pretending
and
you
enjoying
it
she
said
consoling
you
for
not
being
able
to
do
anything
else
said
i
could
do
anything
else
you
nearly
did
and
i
do
suppose
you
can
if
you
could
you
would
bother
about
me
he
was
silent
and
though
she
did
not
look
at
him
she
was
very
keenly
aware
of
his
tall
figure
wrapped
in
an
overcoat
reaching
almost
to
his
heels
and
with
the
big
parcel
under
his
left
arm
he
was
always
slightly
absurd
and
now
when
he
struck
the
top
bar
of
the
railing
with
his
left
hand
and
uttered
a
mournful
it
true
the
tragedy
in
his
tone
could
not
repress
her
smile
yet
if
he
had
been
less
funny
he
might
have
been
less
truly
tragic
you
see
i
only
a
kind
of
makeshift
she
remarked
he
said
i
may
have
been
mistaken
in
myself
i
not
mistaken
about
you
never
he
cried
striking
the
rail
again
they
were
alone
on
the
hill
but
suddenly
with
a
clatter
of
wings
a
bird
left
his
nest
in
the
rocks
and
swept
out
of
sight
leaving
a
memory
of
swiftness
and
life
of
an
intenser
blackness
in
the
gulf
far
below
them
to
the
left
there
were
lights
stationary
and
moving
and
sometimes
the
clang
of
a
tramcar
bell
reached
them
with
its
harsh
music
the
slim
line
of
the
bridge
with
here
and
there
a
dimly
burning
light
was
like
a
spangled
thread
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
voices
came
to
them
from
the
road
behind
the
hill
after
all
charles
said
more
clearly
does
matter
about
being
acclaimed
it
just
like
making
music
for
deaf
people
the
music
there
the
music
there
and
so
it
does
matter
very
much
whether
you
love
me
it
one
weakness
that
wants
that
loneliness
i
can
love
you
just
the
same
perhaps
better
it
the
audience
that
spoils
things
i
should
think
it
does
you
quite
happy
quite
he
answered
i
have
something
to
do
something
i
can
do
too
music
no
i
not
good
enough
i
no
more
than
an
amateur
but
in
this
i
can
be
supreme
ca
be
sure
of
that
she
said
acutely
you
wrote
a
poem
you
might
think
it
was
perfect
but
you
would
absolutely
know
till
you
tried
it
on
other
people
so
you
ca
be
sure
about
love
might
be
he
said
with
a
touch
of
scorn
may
depend
on
other
people
but
i
do
she
made
a
small
sound
of
scorn
you
never
know
whether
doing
this
wonderful
work
of
yours
well
or
not
because
she
said
cruelly
exultant
wo
be
tested
but
it
might
be
you
got
to
do
things
as
though
they
will
be
suppose
so
she
said
indifferently
now
i
must
go
back
he
turned
obediently
and
thrust
the
parcel
at
her
are
you
going
to
take
me
home
she
asked
i
do
think
i
need
do
that
i
shall
stay
here
i
wo
have
your
chocolates
i
did
want
them
anyhow
but
now
i
wo
take
them
do
understand
you
he
said
miserably
the
painter
understand
his
paints
or
the
musician
his
instruments
no
you
have
to
begin
at
the
beginning
charles
batty
and
work
very
hard
before
you
a
success
she
ran
from
him
fleetly
hardly
knowing
why
she
was
so
angry
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
no
right
to
be
content
without
her
love
she
felt
he
must
be
emasculate
and
the
guilty
passion
of
francis
sales
was
by
contrast
splendid
but
for
that
passion
charles
batty
might
have
persuaded
her
she
was
incapable
of
rousing
men
desire
and
not
to
rouse
it
was
not
to
be
a
woman
accordingly
she
valued
francis
and
despised
the
other
yet
when
she
had
reached
home
and
run
upstairs
and
was
standing
in
the
dim
room
where
the
firelight
cast
big
uncertain
shadows
like
vague
threats
on
walls
and
ceiling
she
suffered
a
reaction
the
scene
on
the
road
became
sinister
she
remembered
the
strange
silence
of
the
trees
and
the
clangorous
barking
of
the
dogs
the
hoarse
voices
from
the
encampment
in
the
hollow
it
had
been
very
dark
there
and
an
extraordinary
blackness
had
buried
her
when
she
was
in
that
man
arms
it
had
been
dark
too
on
the
hill
but
with
a
feeling
of
space
and
height
and
freedom
if
charles
had
been
a
little
different
but
then
he
did
not
really
want
her
he
was
making
a
study
of
his
sorrow
he
was
gazing
at
it
turning
it
round
and
over
growing
familiar
with
all
its
aspects
he
was
an
artist
frustrated
of
any
power
but
this
of
feeling
and
to
have
given
him
herself
would
simply
have
been
to
rob
him
of
what
he
found
more
precious
but
she
and
francis
sales
were
kin
she
understood
him
he
was
not
better
than
herself
perhaps
he
was
not
so
good
and
he
too
was
unhappy
but
he
did
not
love
her
for
those
qualities
of
which
charles
batty
had
talked
by
the
monks
pool
he
wove
no
poetry
about
her
he
loved
her
because
she
was
pretty
because
her
mouth
was
red
and
her
eyes
bright
and
her
body
young
he
loved
her
because
being
her
father
daughter
her
youth
answered
his
desire
with
enough
shame
to
season
appetite
but
not
to
spoil
it
and
she
thought
of
christabel
as
of
some
sick
doll
dinner
was
a
strange
meal
that
night
caroline
chair
was
empty
and
the
sighs
of
sophia
were
like
gentle
zephyrs
in
the
room
silence
might
have
been
interpreted
as
anxiety
about
her
aunt
and
susan
informed
the
cook
truly
enough
that
miss
henrietta
had
a
feeling
heart
it
was
only
rose
who
could
have
explained
the
nature
of
the
feeling
she
was
fascinated
by
the
sight
of
henrietta
her
rival
her
fellow
dupe
rose
looked
at
her
without
envy
or
malice
or
covetousness
but
with
an
extraordinary
interest
trying
to
find
what
likeness
to
herself
and
what
differences
had
attracted
francis
sales
there
was
the
dark
hair
curly
where
hers
was
straight
dark
eyes
instead
of
grey
ones
the
same
warm
pallor
of
the
skin
in
case
slightly
overlaid
with
pink
but
the
mouth
ah
it
must
be
the
mouth
and
what
it
meant
that
made
the
alluring
difference
mouth
was
soft
red
and
mutinous
in
her
father
it
had
been
a
blemish
half
hidden
by
the
foreign
cut
of
moustache
and
beard
but
in
henrietta
it
was
a
beauty
and
a
warning
rose
had
never
properly
studied
that
mouth
before
and
under
the
fixity
of
her
gaze
eyelids
fluttered
upwards
there
were
shadows
under
her
eyes
and
it
seemed
to
rose
that
she
had
changed
a
little
she
must
have
changed
rose
had
never
been
in
the
arms
of
francis
sales
she
shuddered
now
at
the
thought
but
she
knew
that
she
too
would
have
been
different
after
that
experience
she
looked
at
henrietta
with
the
sadness
of
her
desire
to
help
her
the
fear
of
her
inability
to
do
it
and
henrietta
looked
back
with
a
hint
of
defiance
the
symbol
of
her
attitude
to
the
cruel
world
in
which
fond
lovers
were
despised
and
love
had
a
hard
road
rose
restrained
an
impulse
to
lean
across
the
table
and
say
quietly
saw
you
with
francis
sales
and
i
am
sorry
for
you
he
told
me
i
should
not
let
you
meet
him
he
said
that
himself
so
you
see
he
does
not
want
you
and
she
wondered
how
much
that
cry
of
his
had
been
uttered
in
despair
of
his
passion
and
how
much
in
weariness
of
henrietta
and
himself
rose
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
immediately
straightened
she
was
intolerably
tired
but
she
refused
to
droop
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
never
to
be
free
from
secrecy
after
her
release
there
had
been
a
short
time
of
dreary
peace
and
now
she
had
henrietta
fight
to
wage
in
secret
her
burden
to
carry
without
a
word
and
this
was
worse
more
difficult
for
she
had
less
power
with
which
to
meet
more
danger
between
the
candle
lights
she
sent
a
smile
to
henrietta
but
the
girl
mouth
was
petulantly
set
and
it
was
a
relief
when
sophia
quavered
out
wo
be
able
to
go
to
the
battys
ball
she
will
be
rose
and
henrietta
were
momentarily
united
in
their
common
amazement
at
the
genuineness
of
this
sorrow
and
to
both
there
was
something
comic
in
the
picture
of
the
elderly
caroline
suffering
from
a
chill
and
bemoaning
the
loss
of
an
evening
pleasure
henrietta
cast
a
look
of
scornful
surprise
at
her
aunt
sophia
was
the
battys
ball
a
matter
for
a
broken
heart
rose
said
consolingly
is
till
after
christmas
perhaps
she
will
be
well
enough
christmas
sophia
wailed
first
christmas
here
with
caroline
upstairs
do
like
christmas
henrietta
said
makes
me
miserable
you
will
like
the
ball
rose
said
if
it
had
been
for
the
ball
we
might
have
been
in
algiers
now
caroline
ill
i
should
have
sent
for
you
we
start
henrietta
in
a
few
weeks
time
she
ignored
henrietta
vague
murmur
not
until
caroline
is
quite
well
sophia
we
could
go
to
the
south
of
france
henrietta
yes
i
think
we
had
better
arrange
that
rose
felt
a
slightly
malicious
pleasure
in
this
proposal
which
became
a
serious
one
as
she
spoke
must
learn
to
speak
french
and
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
been
abroad
it
will
be
a
kindness
to
me
i
do
care
to
go
alone
we
have
no
engagements
after
the
middle
of
january
so
shall
we
settle
to
go
then
there
was
authority
in
her
tone
shall
avoid
brigands
sophia
but
i
think
we
ought
to
go
it
is
not
fair
that
experiences
should
be
confined
to
radstowe
right
dear
sophia
was
unwillingly
but
nobly
truthful
have
a
duty
to
her
father
but
say
nothing
to
caroline
until
she
is
stronger
henrietta
was
silent
but
she
had
a
hot
rage
in
her
heart
she
felt
herself
in
a
trap
and
she
looked
with
sudden
hatred
and
suspicion
at
her
aunt
rose
it
was
impossible
to
defy
that
calm
authority
she
would
have
to
go
in
merest
gratitude
she
must
consent
she
would
be
carried
off
but
she
looked
round
wildly
for
some
means
of
escape
the
prospect
of
that
exile
spoilt
a
christmas
which
otherwise
would
not
have
been
a
miserable
one
for
the
malletts
made
it
a
charming
festival
with
inspired
ideas
for
gifts
and
a
delightful
party
on
christmas
day
when
caroline
was
allowed
to
appear
she
refused
to
say
that
she
was
better
she
had
never
been
ill
it
was
a
mere
fad
of
the
doctor
and
her
sisters
she
supposed
they
were
tired
of
her
and
wanted
a
little
peace
however
she
continued
to
absorb
large
quantities
of
strengthening
food
beef
tea
meat
jelly
and
heady
tonic
for
she
loved
food
and
she
was
determined
to
go
to
the
ball
this
was
on
new
year
eve
and
all
that
day
from
the
moment
when
susan
drew
the
curtains
and
brought
the
early
tea
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
excitement
in
nelson
lodge
and
henrietta
permitted
herself
to
enjoy
it
francis
sales
was
to
be
at
the
ball
she
forgot
the
threatened
exile
she
ignored
charles
batty
tiresome
insistence
that
she
must
dance
with
him
twice
as
many
times
as
with
anybody
else
because
he
was
engaged
to
her
do
believe
you
can
dance
a
bit
she
cried
can
get
round
he
said
the
noise
of
the
band
that
upsets
me
jingle
jingle
bang
bang
but
we
can
sit
out
when
we
ca
bear
it
any
longer
would
be
very
amusing
henrietta
said
susan
drawing
henrietta
curtains
remarked
that
it
was
a
nice
day
for
the
ball
and
then
looking
severely
at
henrietta
and
arranging
a
wrap
round
her
shoulders
she
said
suppose
miss
caroline
is
going
i
hope
so
henrietta
said
not
worse
is
she
that
i
know
of
miss
henrietta
but
i
afraid
it
will
be
the
death
of
her
she
seemed
to
think
it
would
be
henrietta
fault
and
in
the
kitchen
she
told
cook
that
but
for
miss
henrietta
the
battys
who
were
people
you
had
only
to
look
at
batty
mouth
would
not
be
giving
a
ball
at
all
but
they
had
their
eyes
on
miss
henrietta
for
that
son
of
theirs
she
was
sure
of
it
and
miss
caroline
was
not
fit
to
go
it
would
be
the
death
of
her
cook
was
optimistic
it
would
do
miss
caroline
good
she
was
always
the
better
for
a
little
fun
the
elder
ladies
breakfasted
in
bed
to
save
themselves
all
unnecessary
fatigue
and
throughout
the
day
they
moved
behind
blinds
henrietta
was
warned
not
to
walk
out
there
was
a
cold
wind
her
face
would
be
roughened
and
when
she
insisted
on
air
and
exercise
she
was
advised
to
wear
a
thick
veil
both
ladies
offered
her
a
covering
for
the
face
but
henrietta
shook
her
head
she
said
lifting
a
hand
of
each
to
either
cheek
a
flower
sophia
said
wind
does
hurt
flowers
it
wo
hurt
me
fires
were
lighted
in
the
bedroom
earlier
than
usual
caroline
and
sophia
again
retired
to
their
room
leaving
orders
that
they
were
not
to
be
disturbed
until
four
and
a
solemn
hush
fell
on
the
house
while
the
ladies
were
having
tea
susan
was
busy
in
their
bedroom
laying
out
their
gowns
and
henrietta
chancing
to
pass
the
open
door
peeped
in
the
bed
was
spread
with
the
and
apricot
dresses
of
their
choice
with
petticoats
of
corresponding
hues
with
silken
stockings
and
long
gloves
and
fans
and
on
the
mound
made
by
the
pillows
two
pairs
of
very
slippers
pointed
their
narrow
toes
it
might
have
been
the
room
of
two
young
girls
and
before
she
fluttered
down
to
tea
henrietta
took
another
glance
at
the
mass
of
yellow
tulle
on
her
own
bed
she
wished
banks
and
miss
stubb
could
see
her
in
that
dress
banks
would
cry
and
miss
stubb
would
grow
poetical
she
would
have
to
write
and
tell
them
all
about
it
at
eight
the
four
miss
malletts
assembled
in
the
caroline
was
magnificent
old
lace
veiled
the
shimmering
satin
of
her
gown
and
made
it
possible
to
wear
the
family
emeralds
these
heavily
set
were
on
her
neck
and
in
her
ears
a
pair
of
bracelets
adorned
her
arms
seen
from
behind
she
might
have
been
the
stout
and
prosperous
mother
of
a
family
in
her
prime
and
only
when
she
turned
and
displayed
the
pink
patches
on
yellow
skin
was
her
age
discernible
she
was
magnificent
and
terrible
and
henrietta
had
a
moment
of
recoil
before
she
gasped
aunt
caroline
how
lovely
sophia
advanced
more
modestly
for
inspection
looks
about
caroline
exclaimed
a
figure
like
a
girl
prejudiced
dear
caroline
i
never
had
your
air
wonderful
all
wonderful
henrietta
cried
they
had
all
managed
to
express
themselves
caroline
in
the
superb
attempt
at
overcoming
her
age
and
sophia
in
the
softness
of
her
apparel
rose
in
filmy
black
and
pearls
round
her
firm
throat
gently
proud
and
distant
and
henrietta
was
like
some
delicately
gaudy
insect
dancing
hither
and
thither
approaching
and
withdrawing
we
all
wonderful
henrietta
said
again
you
think
we
ought
to
start
it
a
pity
for
other
people
not
to
see
us
with
susan
help
they
began
the
business
of
packing
themselves
into
the
cab
caroline
lifted
her
skirts
and
showed
remarkably
thin
legs
but
she
stood
on
the
doorstep
to
quarrel
with
sophia
about
the
taking
of
a
shawl
she
ought
to
have
a
lace
one
round
her
shoulders
sophia
said
for
the
assembly
rooms
were
always
cold
and
it
was
a
frosty
night
you
an
idiot
caroline
said
you
think
i
going
to
sit
in
a
in
a
shawl
why
not
take
a
bottle
and
a
muff
least
we
must
have
the
smelling
salts
susan
fetch
the
salts
miss
caroline
might
need
them
miss
caroline
said
she
would
rather
die
than
display
such
weakness
and
she
stepped
into
the
cab
which
groaned
under
her
weight
another
fainter
groan
accompanied
sophia
entrance
and
rose
and
henrietta
tapping
their
satin
shoes
on
the
pavement
heard
sounds
of
bickering
sophia
had
forgotten
her
handkerchief
and
susan
fled
once
more
into
the
house
the
cabman
growled
his
disapproval
from
the
box
another
party
to
fetch
he
said
how
many
of
you
going
four
henrietta
said
sweetly
we
sha
be
a
minute
been
waiting
ten
already
said
the
man
the
handkerchief
was
handed
into
the
darkness
of
the
cab
and
rose
and
henrietta
followed
my
toes
caroline
said
tell
that
disagreeable
fellow
to
drive
on
they
had
not
far
to
go
but
the
man
did
not
hurry
his
horse
other
cabs
passed
them
on
the
road
whizzed
by
shall
be
dreadfully
late
henrietta
sighed
am
always
late
for
balls
caroline
said
calmly
rose
leaning
back
in
her
corner
could
see
henrietta
profile
against
the
her
lips
were
parted
she
leaned
forward
eagerly
shall
miss
a
dance
she
murmured
caroline
coughed
dear
sophia
moaned
you
should
be
in
bed
a
silly
old
woman
caroline
retorted
you
promise
not
to
sit
in
a
draught
henrietta
see
that
your
aunt
caroline
does
sit
in
a
draught
but
henrietta
was
letting
down
the
window
for
the
cab
had
drawn
up
before
the
portals
of
the
assembly
rooms
in
the
rose
and
henrietta
slipped
off
their
wraps
glanced
in
the
mirror
and
were
ready
but
there
were
anxious
little
whisperings
and
consultations
on
the
part
of
the
elder
ladies
and
henrietta
cast
a
despairing
glance
at
rose
would
they
never
be
ready
but
at
last
caroline
uttered
a
majestic
and
led
the
way
like
a
plump
duck
swimming
across
a
pond
with
a
fleet
of
smaller
ducks
behind
her
no
expense
and
no
trouble
had
been
spared
to
justify
the
expectations
of
radstowe
the
antechamber
was
luxuriously
carpeted
cushioned
palmed
and
screened
and
the
hired
flunkey
at
the
ballroom
door
had
a
presence
and
a
voice
fitted
for
the
occasion
mallett
he
bawled
sophia
mallett
miss
rose
mallett
miss
henrietta
mallett
the
moment
had
come
henrietta
lifted
her
head
settled
her
shoulders
and
prepared
to
meet
the
eyes
of
francis
sales
the
malletts
had
arrived
between
the
first
and
second
dances
and
the
guests
sitting
round
the
walls
had
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
stately
entrance
batty
in
diamonds
and
purple
satin
greeted
the
with
enthusiasm
and
james
batty
escorted
caroline
and
sophia
to
that
had
all
the
appearance
of
thrones
batty
patted
henrietta
on
the
shoulder
dear
she
said
you
are
at
last
there
are
a
lot
of
boys
with
their
programmes
half
empty
till
you
come
and
my
charles
too
not
that
he
much
for
dancing
i
told
him
he
must
look
after
the
ugly
ones
we
going
to
have
a
quadrille
for
your
aunts
sake
and
then
whispering
she
asked
do
you
think
of
it
i
said
if
we
had
it
at
all
we
have
it
good
gorgeous
henrietta
said
and
off
the
stage
she
had
never
seen
a
grander
spectacle
the
platform
at
the
end
of
the
room
was
banked
with
flowers
and
behind
them
uniformed
and
musicians
played
with
ardour
with
rapture
their
eyes
closing
sentimentally
in
the
choicest
passages
baskets
of
flowers
hung
from
the
chandeliers
the
floor
was
polished
to
the
slipperiness
of
ice
and
batty
on
her
hospitable
journeys
to
and
fro
was
in
constant
danger
of
a
fall
the
society
of
radstowe
all
in
new
garments
appeared
to
henrietta
of
a
dazzling
brilliance
but
she
stood
easily
holding
her
head
high
as
though
she
were
well
used
to
this
kind
of
glory
looking
round
she
saw
francis
sales
leaning
against
a
wall
talking
to
his
partner
and
smiling
with
unnecessary
amiability
a
flame
of
jealousy
flickered
hotly
through
her
body
how
could
he
smile
like
that
why
did
he
not
come
to
her
and
then
in
the
pride
of
her
secret
love
she
remembered
that
he
dare
not
show
his
eagerness
they
belonged
to
each
other
they
were
alone
in
their
love
and
all
these
people
talking
laughing
fluttering
fans
thinking
themselves
of
immense
importance
had
no
real
existence
he
and
she
alone
of
all
that
company
existed
with
a
fierceness
that
changed
the
sensuous
into
the
cry
of
essential
passion
young
men
approached
her
and
wrote
their
initials
on
her
programme
which
was
already
marked
with
little
crosses
against
the
numbers
she
had
promised
to
francis
sales
charles
batty
rather
hot
anxious
and
glowering
arrived
too
late
his
angry
disgust
his
sense
of
desertion
were
beyond
words
he
stared
at
her
my
flowers
he
demanded
do
shout
are
my
flowers
i
sent
some
roses
and
lilies
and
maidenhair
where
are
they
have
seen
them
i
suppose
you
did
like
them
but
the
girl
in
the
shop
told
me
they
would
be
all
right
how
should
i
know
have
seen
them
she
repeated
over
his
shoulder
she
saw
the
figure
of
francis
sales
coming
towards
her
ordered
them
yesterday
charles
continued
loudly
kill
that
girl
i
go
at
once
shop
will
be
shut
henrietta
reminded
him
do
be
quiet
charles
she
turned
with
a
smile
for
francis
has
a
dance
left
charles
said
sales
took
the
precaution
of
booking
them
in
advance
henrietta
said
lightly
and
with
a
miserable
gesture
charles
went
off
muttering
had
thought
of
that
why
did
some
one
tell
me
that
ball
was
to
be
known
in
nelson
lodge
as
the
one
that
killed
miss
caroline
but
miss
caroline
had
her
full
share
of
pleasure
out
of
it
it
was
the
custom
in
radstowe
to
make
much
of
caroline
and
sophia
they
were
respected
and
playfully
loved
and
it
was
not
only
the
gentlemen
who
asked
them
to
dance
and
john
and
charles
batty
were
not
the
only
young
ones
who
had
the
honour
of
leading
them
into
the
middle
of
the
room
taking
a
few
turns
in
a
waltz
and
returning
in
good
order
to
the
francis
sales
had
their
names
on
his
programme
but
with
him
they
used
the
privilege
of
old
friends
and
preferred
to
talk
can
keep
your
dancing
for
rose
and
henrietta
caroline
said
comes
too
late
for
me
rose
said
pleasantly
he
gave
her
something
remarkably
like
one
of
his
old
looks
and
she
answered
it
with
a
grave
one
there
was
gnawing
trouble
at
her
heart
she
had
watched
his
meeting
with
henrietta
it
had
been
wordless
everything
was
understood
she
had
also
seen
the
unhappiness
of
charles
batty
and
on
an
inspiration
she
said
to
him
you
must
take
pity
on
an
old
maid
i
have
all
these
dances
to
give
away
for
him
this
dance
was
to
be
remembered
as
the
beginning
of
his
friendship
with
rose
mallett
but
at
the
moment
he
was
merely
annoyed
at
being
prevented
from
watching
henrietta
dark
head
appearing
and
disappearing
among
the
other
dancers
like
that
of
a
bather
in
a
rough
sea
he
said
thank
you
very
much
are
you
sure
there
nobody
else
but
i
suppose
there
ca
be
and
holding
her
at
arm
length
he
ambled
round
her
treading
occasionally
on
her
toes
he
apologized
he
was
no
good
at
dancing
he
hoped
he
had
not
hurt
her
slippers
or
her
feet
she
paused
and
looked
down
at
them
must
do
that
to
henrietta
her
slippers
are
yellow
and
you
would
spoil
them
is
giving
me
a
single
dance
he
burst
out
asked
her
to
but
i
never
thought
i
ought
to
get
a
promise
nobody
told
me
nobody
tells
me
anything
an
icily
angry
gentleman
remonstrated
with
him
for
standing
in
the
fairway
and
rose
suggested
that
they
should
sit
down
see
i
no
good
i
ca
dance
i
ca
please
her
you
still
in
the
way
let
us
go
somewhere
quiet
and
then
you
can
tell
me
all
about
it
he
took
her
to
a
small
room
leading
from
the
big
one
shut
the
door
he
said
then
we
sha
hear
that
hideous
din
is
a
very
good
band
profane
charles
said
wearily
they
call
it
music
he
was
off
at
a
great
pace
and
she
did
not
try
to
hold
him
in
she
lay
back
in
the
big
chair
and
seemed
to
study
the
toes
on
which
charles
batty
had
trampled
his
voice
rolled
on
like
the
sound
of
water
companionable
and
unanswerable
suddenly
his
tone
changed
is
very
unkind
to
me
there
any
reason
why
she
should
be
do
everything
i
can
think
of
i
told
her
all
about
myself
would
rather
hear
about
herself
done
that
too
perhaps
i
have
done
it
enough
i
given
her
chocolates
and
flowers
what
else
ought
i
to
do
her
voice
very
calm
and
clear
after
his
spluttering
said
too
much
this
was
a
new
idea
i
never
thought
of
that
why
she
interrupted
his
usual
cry
are
naturally
cruel
they
i
did
know
that
either
he
swallowed
the
information
visibly
she
could
almost
see
the
process
of
digestion
he
said
again
do
mean
to
be
they
are
simply
untouched
by
a
love
they
return
she
added
thoughtfully
inclined
to
despise
the
lover
it
he
mourned
despises
me
and
in
a
louder
voice
he
demanded
not
of
rose
mallett
but
of
the
mysterious
world
in
which
he
gropingly
existed
should
she
should
but
perhaps
you
yourself
are
making
a
mistake
she
heard
indistinctly
the
word
ca
be
sure
quite
certain
about
that
about
nothing
else
his
big
hands
moved
cling
to
that
you
must
be
ready
to
serve
her
charles
if
i
ever
needed
you
do
anything
for
you
because
you
her
aunt
and
besides
he
said
simply
rather
like
her
in
the
face
you
but
it
her
you
may
have
to
serve
and
not
me
i
want
her
to
be
happy
i
do
know
where
her
happiness
is
but
i
know
where
it
is
not
some
day
i
may
tell
you
she
looked
at
him
he
might
be
useful
as
an
ally
she
was
sure
he
could
be
trusted
you
will
do
anything
i
ask
for
her
sake
he
turned
the
head
which
had
been
sunk
on
his
crumpled
shirt
anything
the
matter
he
asked
concerned
and
more
alert
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
she
said
for
the
door
behind
was
opening
and
it
let
in
a
murmur
of
voices
and
a
rush
of
cold
fresh
air
rose
shivered
and
looking
round
she
saw
henrietta
and
francis
sales
her
cloak
was
half
on
and
half
off
her
shoulders
her
colour
was
very
high
and
her
eyes
were
not
so
dazzled
by
the
light
that
she
did
not
immediately
recognize
her
aunt
it
was
francis
sales
who
hesitated
and
rose
said
quickly
please
shut
the
door
he
obeyed
and
stood
by
henrietta
side
a
pleasing
figure
looking
taller
and
more
finely
made
in
his
black
clothes
you
been
on
the
terrace
it
a
glorious
night
get
cold
charles
said
severely
she
had
been
out
there
with
the
man
who
murdered
music
and
who
therefore
was
a
scoundrel
and
charles
objection
was
based
on
that
fact
and
not
on
francis
married
state
he
had
not
the
pleasure
of
feeling
a
pious
indignation
that
a
man
with
an
invalid
wife
walked
on
the
terrace
with
henrietta
he
would
have
said
not
and
he
would
have
found
an
excuse
for
any
man
in
the
beauty
the
wonder
the
enchantment
of
that
girl
though
he
could
not
forgive
henrietta
for
her
friendship
with
the
slaughterer
of
music
and
of
birds
he
glared
and
repeated
be
henrietta
pretended
not
to
hear
him
and
rose
said
thoughtfully
and
slowly
no
charles
people
do
get
cold
when
they
are
happy
suppose
not
he
felt
in
a
vague
way
that
he
and
rose
sitting
there
for
he
had
forgotten
to
stand
up
were
united
against
the
other
two
who
stood
very
clear
against
the
wall
of
the
room
and
that
those
two
were
conscious
of
the
antagonism
they
also
were
united
and
he
felt
an
increase
of
his
dull
pain
at
the
sight
of
their
comeliness
the
suspicion
of
their
likeness
to
each
other
suppose
not
charles
said
and
after
that
no
one
spoke
as
though
it
were
impossible
to
find
a
light
word
and
unnecessary
each
one
was
aware
of
conflict
of
something
fierce
and
silent
going
on
but
it
was
rose
who
understood
the
situation
best
and
charles
who
understood
it
least
his
feelings
were
torturing
but
simple
he
wanted
henrietta
and
he
could
not
get
her
he
did
not
please
her
and
that
sales
that
philistine
that
handsome
beggar
knew
how
to
do
it
but
rose
was
conscious
of
the
working
of
four
minds
there
was
her
own
sore
with
the
past
and
troubled
by
a
present
in
which
her
lover
concealed
his
discomfiture
under
the
easy
sullenness
of
his
pose
he
too
had
the
past
shared
with
her
to
haunt
him
but
he
had
also
a
present
bright
with
henrietta
allurements
yet
darkly
streaked
with
prohibitions
struggles
and
surrenders
and
rose
saw
that
the
worst
tragedy
was
his
and
hers
it
must
not
be
henrietta
in
their
youth
she
and
francis
had
misunderstood
and
in
their
maturity
they
had
failed
each
other
it
was
the
fault
of
neither
and
henrietta
must
not
be
the
victim
of
their
folly
looking
at
the
big
fan
of
black
feathers
spread
on
her
knee
rose
smiled
a
little
with
a
maternal
tenderness
henrietta
was
her
father
daughter
wilful
and
lovable
but
she
was
also
the
daughter
of
that
mother
who
had
been
good
and
loving
henrietta
had
her
father
passion
for
excitement
but
being
a
woman
she
had
the
greater
need
of
being
loved
and
rose
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
charles
with
an
ironical
appreciation
of
his
worthiness
of
his
comicality
she
saw
him
with
henrietta
eyes
and
her
white
shoulders
lifted
and
dropped
in
resignation
then
she
looked
at
henrietta
and
smiled
frankly
dance
has
begun
she
said
must
be
looking
for
you
henrietta
said
with
mr
sales
and
turning
to
him
with
the
effect
of
ignoring
rose
she
said
in
a
clear
voice
which
became
slightly
harsh
as
she
saw
him
gazing
at
her
aunt
oddly
almost
as
though
he
were
astonished
by
a
new
sight
we
go
back
to
the
terrace
or
shall
we
dance
get
cold
charles
said
again
angrily
us
dance
sales
said
the
door
to
the
closed
behind
them
and
charles
let
out
a
groan
see
he
said
rose
hoped
he
did
not
see
too
much
and
she
was
reassured
when
he
added
takes
no
notice
of
me
charles
but
you
know
you
treat
her
a
little
like
a
child
you
should
talk
of
catching
cold
you
too
material
she
was
surprised
to
hear
him
say
with
a
sort
of
humble
pride
before
other
people
she
heard
me
different
then
dropping
into
the
despair
of
his
own
thoughts
and
with
the
rage
of
one
feeling
himself
sinking
hopelessly
he
cried
out
like
pouring
water
through
a
sieve
the
voice
of
rose
very
calm
and
wise
said
gently
to
pour
all
very
fine
he
muttered
to
pour
it
may
be
all
you
can
do
but
it
is
worth
while
told
her
i
would
do
that
one
night
on
the
hill
she
said
she
did
want
it
does
know
rose
said
in
the
same
voice
comforting
in
its
quietness
she
stood
up
had
better
go
back
now
and
remember
you
promise
to
do
for
her
anything
i
ask
of
you
course
he
said
i
shall
do
it
wrong
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
must
be
done
rightly
it
must
it
will
be
now
take
me
back
he
resigned
her
unwillingly
for
he
felt
that
she
was
his
strength
to
the
partner
who
claimed
her
but
as
she
prepared
to
dance
charles
returned
hurriedly
and
ignoring
the
affronted
gentleman
who
had
already
clasped
her
he
said
anxiously
service
what
is
it
is
there
something
wrong
she
looked
deeply
into
his
eyes
must
not
be
and
now
for
him
in
the
sea
of
dancers
there
were
two
dark
heads
bobbing
among
the
waves
the
hours
sped
by
the
lavish
supper
was
consumed
dresses
and
flowers
lost
their
freshness
the
musicians
lost
their
energetic
ardour
the
man
at
the
piano
was
seen
to
yawn
cavernously
above
the
keys
the
guests
began
to
depart
leaving
an
exhausted
but
happy
batty
she
had
been
complimented
by
miss
mallett
on
the
perfection
of
her
arrangements
on
the
brilliance
of
the
assembly
on
the
music
and
even
on
the
refreshments
and
batty
had
blessed
her
own
perseverance
against
batty
obstinacy
in
the
matter
of
the
supper
he
had
wanted
light
refreshments
and
she
had
insisted
on
a
affair
and
miss
caroline
had
actually
remarked
on
the
wisdom
of
a
solid
meal
she
had
no
patience
with
snacks
batty
intended
to
lull
batty
to
slumber
with
that
quotation
in
the
cab
as
the
malletts
jolted
home
in
the
care
of
the
same
surly
driver
caroline
complaisantly
spoke
of
her
congratulations
she
would
not
have
said
so
much
to
anybody
else
but
she
knew
batty
would
be
pleased
she
was
dear
sophia
said
but
her
more
delicate
social
sense
was
troubled
i
do
think
one
ought
to
treat
everybody
as
one
would
treat
the
greatest
lady
in
the
land
i
think
we
ought
to
have
taken
for
granted
that
everything
would
be
correct
you
must
treat
people
as
they
want
to
be
treated
she
was
panting
for
praise
and
she
got
it
and
anyhow
it
too
late
to
argue
they
had
stayed
to
the
end
so
that
henrietta
pleasure
should
not
be
curtailed
and
now
she
was
leaning
back
very
white
and
still
believe
the
child
asleep
sophia
whispered
i
not
i
wide
awake
you
enjoy
it
dear
much
said
henrietta
kept
my
eye
on
you
child
caroline
said
henrietta
made
an
effort
kept
my
eye
on
you
aunt
caroline
i
saw
you
flirting
with
mr
batty
sophia
do
you
hear
her
i
only
danced
with
him
twice
though
i
admit
he
hovered
round
my
chair
they
always
did
i
help
it
we
all
like
that
you
should
have
seen
your
father
at
a
ball
there
was
no
one
like
him
such
an
air
ah
here
we
are
i
suppose
this
disagreeable
cabman
must
be
tipped
see
to
that
rose
said
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
spoken
quick
caroline
do
stand
in
the
cold
dancing
has
done
me
good
caroline
said
and
she
lingered
on
the
pavement
to
look
at
the
stars
holding
her
skirts
high
in
the
happy
knowledge
of
her
unrivalled
legs
and
feet
sophia
i
am
not
cold
or
tired
but
yes
i
take
a
little
soup
they
sat
round
the
roaring
fire
prepared
for
them
and
drank
the
soup
out
of
fine
old
cups
caroline
chattered
she
was
gay
she
believed
she
had
been
a
great
success
young
men
had
paid
court
to
her
she
had
rapped
at
least
one
of
them
with
her
fan
a
man
had
talked
to
her
of
her
lively
past
but
sophia
had
much
ado
to
prevent
her
heavy
head
from
nodding
henrietta
was
silent
very
busy
with
her
thoughts
and
careful
to
avoid
the
eyes
of
rose
think
caroline
said
ought
to
give
a
little
dance
we
could
have
this
carpet
up
just
a
little
dance
henrietta
and
i
rose
said
distinctly
going
away
nonsense
you
must
put
it
off
we
ought
to
give
a
dance
for
the
child
now
how
many
couples
ten
at
least
sophia
you
asleep
dear
a
party
i
heard
but
if
you
ready
now
i
think
i
go
to
bed
along
i
follow
no
caroline
we
always
go
together
well
i
come
but
i
could
stay
here
and
talk
for
hours
i
could
always
sit
you
out
and
dance
you
out
could
i
dear
you
wonderful
such
spirit
they
kissed
rose
they
both
kissed
henrietta
on
each
cheek
little
dance
caroline
repeated
and
patted
henrietta
arm
child
she
murmured
henrietta
went
upstairs
behind
them
slowly
not
to
overtake
sophia
she
did
not
want
to
be
left
down
there
with
aunt
rose
she
wanted
solitude
and
she
knew
now
what
people
meant
when
they
talked
of
being
in
a
dream
under
her
hand
the
slim
mahogany
rail
felt
like
the
cold
firm
hand
of
francis
sales
when
after
their
last
dance
together
he
had
led
her
on
to
the
terrace
again
they
were
alone
there
for
the
wind
was
very
cold
but
for
henrietta
it
was
part
of
the
exquisite
mantle
in
which
she
was
wrapped
she
was
wrapped
in
the
glamour
of
the
night
and
the
stars
and
the
excitement
of
the
dance
yet
suddenly
looking
down
at
the
dark
river
she
was
chilled
she
said
and
her
voice
seemed
to
be
carried
off
by
the
wind
rose
is
going
to
take
me
away
he
bent
down
to
her
did
you
say
she
put
her
lips
close
to
his
ear
rose
is
going
to
take
me
away
he
dropped
her
hand
ca
do
that
she
will
i
shall
have
to
go
and
he
said
gloomily
knew
you
would
leave
me
too
she
felt
helpless
and
lonely
her
happiness
had
gone
the
wind
had
risen
she
said
loudly
not
my
fault
what
can
i
do
i
shall
come
back
he
stood
quite
still
and
did
not
look
at
her
do
think
of
me
think
of
nothing
else
how
can
i
tell
her
i
ca
leave
you
she
has
been
good
to
me
was
once
good
to
me
too
that
wo
last
long
that
not
true
she
cried
then
if
she
more
to
you
than
i
am
i
used
to
that
she
moved
away
from
him
why
did
he
not
help
her
he
was
a
man
he
loved
her
but
he
was
cruel
ah
the
thought
warmed
her
it
was
his
love
that
made
him
cruel
he
needed
her
he
was
lonely
under
her
cloak
she
clasped
her
gloved
hands
in
a
helplessness
which
must
be
conquered
what
shall
i
do
she
asked
the
stars
across
the
river
the
cliff
was
sombre
it
seemed
to
listen
and
to
disapprove
the
stars
were
kinder
they
twinkled
they
laughed
they
understood
and
the
lights
on
the
bridge
glowed
steadily
with
reassurance
she
turned
back
to
francis
sales
must
trust
me
she
said
firmly
he
put
his
hands
heavily
on
her
shoulders
wo
let
you
go
a
murmur
inarticulate
and
delighted
escaped
her
lips
this
was
what
she
wanted
very
small
and
willing
to
be
commanded
she
leaned
against
him
will
you
do
with
me
she
whispered
secure
in
his
strength
she
laughed
will
have
to
take
me
away
yourself
would
come
he
said
with
unexpected
seriousness
so
close
to
him
that
the
wind
could
not
steal
the
words
she
answered
would
do
anything
for
one
i
loved
the
memory
of
her
own
voice
its
tenderness
and
seduction
startled
her
in
the
solitude
of
her
room
she
had
not
known
she
could
speak
like
that
she
dropped
her
face
into
her
hands
and
in
the
rapture
of
her
own
daring
and
in
the
recollection
of
the
excitement
which
had
frozen
them
into
a
stillness
through
which
the
beating
of
their
hearts
sounded
like
a
faint
tap
of
drums
there
came
the
doubt
of
her
sincerity
had
she
really
meant
what
she
said
yet
she
could
have
said
nothing
else
the
words
had
left
her
lips
involuntarily
her
voice
as
though
of
itself
had
taken
on
that
tender
tone
she
could
not
have
failed
in
that
dramatic
moment
but
now
she
was
half
afraid
of
her
undertaking
well
her
hands
dropped
to
her
sides
she
had
given
her
word
she
had
promised
herself
in
an
heroic
surrender
and
her
very
doubts
seemed
to
sanctify
the
act
for
a
long
time
she
sat
by
the
fire
half
undressed
her
immature
thin
arms
hanging
loosely
her
sombre
eyes
staring
at
the
fire
she
wished
this
night
might
go
on
for
ever
this
time
of
ecstasy
between
a
promise
and
its
fulfilment
she
had
seen
disillusionment
in
another
and
did
not
laugh
at
its
possibility
for
herself
it
would
come
to
her
she
thought
as
it
had
come
to
her
mother
who
had
hoped
her
daughter
would
find
happiness
in
love
and
henrietta
wondered
if
that
gentle
spirit
was
aware
of
what
was
happening
the
thought
troubled
her
a
little
and
from
her
mother
who
had
been
a
neglected
wife
it
was
no
more
than
a
step
to
that
other
lying
on
her
back
tortured
and
lonely
if
christabel
sales
had
a
daughter
what
would
be
her
fierce
young
thoughts
about
this
thief
sitting
by
the
fire
in
a
joy
which
was
half
misery
yet
she
was
no
thief
she
was
only
picking
up
what
would
otherwise
be
wasted
it
seemed
to
her
that
life
was
hardly
more
than
a
perpetual
and
painful
choice
some
one
had
to
be
hurt
and
why
should
it
not
be
christabel
or
was
she
hurt
enough
already
and
again
what
good
would
she
get
from
sacrifice
no
one
would
gain
except
henrietta
herself
she
could
see
that
plainly
and
she
was
prepared
to
suffer
she
was
anxious
to
suffer
and
be
justified
the
coals
in
the
grate
began
to
fade
the
room
was
cold
and
she
was
tired
slowly
she
continued
her
undressing
throwing
down
her
dainty
garments
with
the
indifference
of
her
fatigue
she
feared
her
thoughts
would
stand
between
her
and
sleep
but
when
she
lay
down
warmth
gradually
stole
over
her
and
soothed
her
into
forgetfulness
she
slept
but
she
waked
to
unusual
sounds
in
the
house
a
door
opened
there
were
footsteps
on
the
landing
and
then
a
voice
shrill
and
frightened
she
jumped
out
of
bed
sophia
was
on
the
landing
rose
was
just
opening
her
door
susan
decently
covered
by
a
puritanical
had
been
roused
by
the
noise
caroline
was
in
pain
sophia
said
she
was
breathing
with
great
difficulty
told
her
she
ought
to
take
a
shawl
sophia
sobbed
fires
had
to
be
lighted
water
boiled
and
flannels
warmed
and
the
voice
of
caroline
was
heard
in
gasping
expostulation
henrietta
dressed
quickly
going
for
the
doctor
she
told
rose
who
was
already
putting
on
her
coat
and
henrietta
noticed
that
she
still
wore
her
evening
gown
she
had
not
been
to
bed
and
for
a
moment
henrietta
forgot
her
aunt
caroline
and
stared
at
her
aunt
rose
am
going
rose
said
quietly
had
you
better
stay
here
aunt
sophia
is
in
such
a
fuss
go
together
rose
said
ca
let
you
go
alone
henrietta
laughed
a
little
this
care
was
so
unnecessary
for
one
who
had
given
herself
to
a
future
full
of
peril
they
went
out
in
the
cold
darkness
of
the
morning
walking
very
fast
and
now
and
then
breaking
into
a
run
and
with
them
there
walked
a
shadowy
third
person
keeping
them
apart
it
was
strange
to
be
yoked
together
by
caroline
danger
and
securely
separated
by
this
shadow
they
did
not
speak
they
had
nothing
to
say
yet
both
thought
what
difference
is
this
going
to
make
but
on
their
way
back
when
the
doctor
had
been
roused
and
they
had
his
promise
to
come
quickly
henrietta
fear
burst
the
bonds
of
her
reserve
do
think
she
is
going
to
die
do
you
rose
put
her
arm
through
henrietta
henrietta
i
hope
not
no
no
i
not
going
to
believe
that
temporarily
united
the
third
person
left
behind
though
following
closely
they
returned
to
the
lighted
house
as
they
stood
in
the
hall
they
could
hear
the
rasping
sound
of
caroline
breathing
john
gibbs
of
sales
hall
milkman
and
news
carrier
shook
his
head
over
the
cans
that
morning
mrs
sales
was
very
bad
the
master
had
fetched
the
doctor
in
the
early
morning
he
had
set
out
in
the
same
car
that
brought
him
from
the
dance
cook
and
susan
looked
at
each
other
with
a
compression
of
lips
and
a
nodding
of
heads
implying
that
misfortune
never
came
singly
but
they
did
not
tell
john
gibbs
of
the
illness
in
their
own
house
they
had
imbibed
something
of
the
mallett
reserve
and
they
did
not
wish
the
family
affairs
to
be
blabbed
at
every
house
in
radstowe
but
when
the
man
had
gone
susan
reminded
cook
of
her
early
disapproval
of
that
ball
it
would
kill
miss
caroline
it
would
kill
mrs
sales
was
there
poor
thing
cook
said
he
was
gallivanting
i
dare
say
it
upset
her
susan
was
right
christabel
sales
had
fretted
herself
into
one
of
her
heart
attacks
but
the
malletts
did
not
know
this
until
later
at
present
they
were
concerned
with
caroline
about
whom
the
doctor
was
reassuring
she
was
very
ill
but
she
had
herself
remarked
that
if
they
were
expecting
her
to
die
they
would
be
disappointed
and
that
was
the
spirit
to
help
recovery
a
nurse
was
installed
in
the
sophia
fluttered
a
little
less
and
rose
and
henrietta
ignored
their
emotion
of
the
early
morning
they
also
avoided
each
other
they
were
both
occupied
with
the
same
problem
though
henrietta
thoughts
had
taken
definite
shape
above
her
dreaming
her
practical
mind
was
dealing
with
concrete
details
and
rose
was
merely
speculating
on
the
future
and
the
more
she
speculated
the
surer
she
became
of
the
necessity
to
interfere
her
plan
of
carrying
henrietta
to
other
lands
was
frustrated
for
the
present
by
caroline
illness
and
she
dared
not
allow
things
to
drift
there
was
a
smouldering
defiance
in
henrietta
manner
she
was
absorbed
yet
wary
she
seemed
to
have
a
grudge
against
the
aunt
who
had
missed
nothing
at
the
dance
who
had
seen
her
exits
and
entrances
with
francis
sales
and
interrupted
their
farewell
glance
the
wave
of
henrietta
gloved
hand
towards
the
tall
figure
standing
in
the
porch
of
the
assembly
rooms
to
see
her
depart
there
was
a
certain
humour
about
the
situation
and
for
rose
an
impeding
feeling
of
hypocrisy
here
she
was
determined
to
put
obstacles
on
the
primrose
path
where
she
herself
once
had
dallied
it
looked
like
the
envy
of
age
for
youth
it
looked
like
inclining
to
virtue
because
the
opposite
was
no
longer
possible
for
her
like
tardy
loyalty
to
christabel
but
she
must
not
be
hampered
by
appearances
her
chief
fear
was
of
hardening
henrietta
temper
and
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
must
appeal
to
francis
sales
himself
it
was
an
unpleasant
task
and
she
dimly
felt
she
hardly
knew
why
a
dangerous
one
and
meeting
henrietta
that
day
at
meals
or
in
the
hushed
quiet
of
the
passages
she
felt
herself
a
traitor
to
the
girl
after
all
what
right
had
she
to
interfere
she
had
no
right
and
her
double
excuse
was
her
knowledge
of
francis
sales
character
and
her
certainty
that
henrietta
was
chiefly
moved
by
her
dramatic
instinct
and
again
rose
wished
that
the
hair
of
charles
batty
head
were
thicker
and
that
he
could
supply
the
needed
but
she
might
at
least
be
able
to
use
him
there
was
no
one
else
that
night
after
an
evening
spent
in
soothing
sophia
fears
which
had
been
roused
by
the
unnatural
gentleness
of
caroline
and
treating
henrietta
to
all
the
friendliness
she
would
receive
rose
went
out
to
post
a
letter
to
francis
sales
she
had
asked
him
with
an
irony
she
had
no
doubt
he
would
miss
to
meet
her
in
the
hollow
where
the
gipsies
had
encamped
and
where
so
many
of
their
interviews
had
taken
place
it
was
within
a
few
yards
of
that
bank
of
primroses
where
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
caroline
was
better
the
next
morning
and
it
was
easy
for
rose
to
escape
she
chose
to
ride
it
was
one
of
those
mild
january
days
which
already
promise
the
return
of
spring
birds
chirped
in
the
leafless
trees
the
earth
was
damp
and
seemed
to
stir
with
the
efforts
of
innumerable
roots
to
produce
a
richer
life
yet
the
leaves
of
autumn
were
still
lying
on
the
ground
how
she
loved
this
country
this
blue
air
this
smell
of
fruit
present
even
before
the
blossom
was
on
the
trees
the
sight
of
wood
smoke
curling
from
the
cottage
chimneys
the
very
ruts
in
the
road
a
little
while
ago
she
had
told
herself
she
was
sickened
by
it
it
was
the
symbol
of
failure
and
young
tender
ruined
hopes
but
the
love
of
it
lay
deeply
in
her
heart
all
this
the
failure
and
the
ruin
were
of
her
life
and
it
could
be
no
more
cast
off
than
could
the
hands
which
had
refused
the
kissing
and
clasping
of
francis
sales
this
was
her
own
country
the
strange
unbridled
stealthy
wildness
of
it
was
in
her
blood
it
was
in
henrietta
through
her
father
it
was
in
francis
too
and
due
to
it
was
this
tragic
muddle
in
which
they
found
themselves
she
had
a
faint
despairing
feeling
that
she
could
not
fight
against
it
that
her
mission
would
only
be
another
failure
yet
she
counted
on
francis
easy
tenderness
of
heart
the
very
weakness
which
persuaded
him
to
an
action
could
turn
him
from
it
and
it
was
to
his
tenderness
she
must
appeal
she
reached
the
track
and
raised
high
on
her
horse
she
could
see
the
fields
with
the
rough
grass
and
gorse
bushes
sloping
to
the
channel
the
pale
strip
of
water
like
silver
melted
in
the
heart
of
the
hills
and
falling
slowly
to
the
sea
the
blue
hills
themselves
like
gates
keeping
a
fair
country
the
place
where
the
wood
had
been
was
like
a
brown
and
purple
rug
but
before
long
the
pattern
would
be
complicated
by
creeping
green
where
the
trees
had
murmured
and
whispered
or
stood
silent
listening
there
was
now
no
sound
no
secrecy
the
place
lay
candidly
under
the
wide
sky
but
from
a
field
out
of
sight
a
sheep
bleated
disconsolately
with
a
sound
of
infinite
uncomprehending
woe
and
a
steamer
in
the
river
sent
out
a
distant
hoot
of
answering
derision
the
gipsies
had
departed
the
ashes
of
their
fire
made
a
black
patch
on
the
ground
and
a
few
rags
fluttered
in
the
wind
there
was
no
human
being
in
sight
and
she
rode
down
the
slope
to
wait
in
the
hollow
she
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
francis
had
received
her
letter
when
with
a
dreary
sense
of
watching
a
familiar
scene
reacted
she
saw
him
in
the
lane
with
henrietta
by
his
side
here
was
an
unexpected
difficulty
and
she
could
do
nothing
but
ride
towards
them
raising
her
whip
in
greeting
she
said
at
once
to
francis
you
get
my
letter
she
saw
henrietta
face
flush
angrily
but
she
knew
that
the
time
had
come
for
her
to
speak
asked
you
to
meet
me
here
he
was
staring
at
her
and
his
mouth
moved
mechanically
i
get
it
by
the
first
post
perhaps
it
there
now
with
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
her
he
moved
back
a
step
rose
smiled
go
and
get
it
fortunately
you
are
here
i
want
to
talk
to
you
henrietta
please
her
voice
was
gentle
she
leaned
forward
in
the
saddle
with
a
charming
gesture
of
request
but
henrietta
shook
her
head
she
was
antagonized
by
that
charm
which
was
holding
francis
eyes
a
loosened
curl
had
fallen
over
her
forehead
giving
to
the
severity
of
her
dress
copied
from
that
portrait
of
her
father
a
dishevelling
touch
as
though
a
young
lady
were
suddenly
discovered
to
be
a
gipsy
in
an
evil
frame
of
mind
it
anything
to
do
with
me
i
going
to
stay
she
said
it
has
i
go
she
looked
at
francis
and
added
between
her
teeth
it
must
have
those
words
and
that
look
claimed
him
for
her
own
rose
lifted
her
chin
and
looked
over
the
two
heads
the
uncovered
one
of
francis
sales
and
henrietta
with
her
hat
a
little
askew
and
absurdly
rose
remembered
that
the
child
had
washed
her
hair
the
night
before
that
was
why
the
hat
was
crooked
and
the
curl
loose
making
the
scene
undignified
and
funny
above
the
pain
of
it
rose
spoke
in
a
voice
heightened
by
a
tone
concerns
you
both
she
said
then
you
need
say
it
need
she
francis
she
repeated
the
name
with
a
grave
humour
is
not
fair
to
henrietta
know
that
he
muttered
and
rose
saw
henrietta
shoot
at
him
a
thin
look
of
scorn
henrietta
said
i
do
care
about
that
and
anyhow
we
not
going
to
do
it
any
more
we
tired
of
these
meetings
she
faced
him
we
we
had
just
made
up
our
minds
to
have
no
more
of
them
glad
of
that
said
rose
and
she
fancied
that
the
hurried
beating
of
her
heart
must
be
plain
through
the
thick
stuff
of
her
coat
henrietta
laughed
showing
little
teeth
and
rose
thought
teeth
are
too
small
they
spoil
her
you
need
not
spy
on
us
any
more
henrietta
said
francis
made
a
movement
of
distaste
he
said
as
though
the
words
cost
him
much
labour
do
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
limit
to
what
rose
could
bear
she
stooped
forward
suddenly
and
put
her
cheek
against
the
horse
neck
in
an
impulsive
need
to
express
affection
perhaps
to
get
it
think
i
do
understand
she
said
quietly
i
do
too
well
she
paused
and
in
her
overpowering
sense
of
helplessness
of
distrust
she
found
herself
making
without
a
quiver
the
confession
of
her
own
foolishness
do
know
whether
francis
has
told
you
that
he
and
i
were
once
in
love
with
one
another
at
least
that
is
what
we
called
it
very
pale
appearing
to
have
grown
thinner
in
that
moment
she
looked
at
the
horse
ears
and
spoke
as
though
she
and
henrietta
were
alone
quite
lately
then
he
realized
we
both
realized
our
mistake
but
it
seems
that
francis
must
have
somebody
to
to
meet
to
kiss
between
me
and
you
there
has
been
some
one
else
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
she
put
aside
that
thought
used
to
meet
here
often
this
place
must
be
full
of
memories
for
him
for
me
the
whole
countryside
is
scattered
with
little
broken
bits
of
love
it
breaks
so
easily
or
it
may
be
only
the
counterfeit
that
breaks
anyhow
it
broke
it
chipped
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
that
she
touched
her
horse
with
her
heel
and
turned
down
the
lane
she
went
slowly
sitting
very
straight
but
she
had
the
constant
expectation
of
being
shot
in
the
back
she
had
to
remind
herself
that
henrietta
had
no
weapon
but
her
eyes
it
was
those
eyes
francis
sales
chiefly
remembered
when
he
had
parted
from
henrietta
and
turned
homewards
there
had
been
scorn
in
them
anger
grief
jealousy
and
expectation
if
she
had
not
been
so
small
if
they
had
not
been
raised
to
his
if
he
could
have
looked
levelly
into
them
as
he
did
into
the
clear
grey
eyes
of
rose
things
might
have
been
different
but
she
was
little
and
she
had
clung
to
him
looking
up
she
had
told
him
she
could
never
see
her
aunt
rose
again
how
could
she
was
he
sure
he
did
not
love
rose
still
was
he
sure
he
ought
to
be
for
it
was
he
who
had
made
henrietta
love
him
he
had
liked
that
tribute
too
much
to
contradict
it
but
rose
mallett
was
right
whoever
had
been
the
promoter
of
this
business
it
was
not
fair
to
henrietta
and
the
thought
of
rose
so
white
and
straight
was
like
wind
after
a
sultry
day
she
was
like
a
church
he
thought
a
dim
church
with
tall
pillars
losing
themselves
in
the
loftiness
of
the
roof
yes
that
was
what
was
the
matter
with
her
she
was
cold
but
there
was
no
one
like
her
you
could
not
forget
her
even
in
the
warmth
of
henrietta
presence
one
way
and
another
these
malletts
tortured
him
he
walked
home
trying
to
find
some
way
out
of
this
maze
of
promises
to
henrietta
and
of
and
his
mental
wanderings
were
interrupted
by
an
unwelcome
request
from
the
nurse
that
he
should
go
at
once
to
mrs
sales
she
seemed
the
woman
warned
him
to
be
very
much
excited
would
he
please
be
careful
she
must
not
have
another
heart
attack
as
he
entered
the
room
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
treading
on
all
his
life
but
a
sudden
pity
swept
him
at
the
sight
of
his
wife
very
weak
from
the
pain
of
the
night
before
last
yet
intensely
almost
viciously
alive
he
wished
he
had
not
gone
to
the
battys
ball
it
had
upset
her
and
done
him
no
good
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
walk
on
the
terrace
he
shut
the
door
gently
and
stood
by
her
you
in
pain
he
asked
he
felt
remorsefully
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
treat
her
he
had
not
love
enough
yet
with
all
his
heart
he
wanted
to
be
kind
have
kissed
me
she
said
do
do
it
you
want
to
do
you
i
do
he
said
and
as
he
bent
over
her
he
was
touched
by
the
contented
sigh
she
gave
if
he
could
begin
over
again
he
told
himself
with
the
virtue
of
the
man
who
has
committed
himself
fatally
things
would
be
different
if
he
had
brought
henrietta
to
such
a
pass
they
should
be
different
now
never
stopped
being
fond
of
you
christabel
she
laughed
and
disconcerted
him
of
your
horses
or
your
dogs
she
said
one
could
expect
you
to
care
much
for
a
useless
log
like
me
no
one
could
have
expected
you
not
to
go
to
that
dance
tears
filled
her
eyes
i
was
lonely
and
i
imagined
you
there
wish
i
had
gone
he
said
truthfully
she
seemed
to
consider
that
remark
but
presently
she
asked
you
lost
something
he
had
lost
a
great
deal
for
rose
despised
him
that
had
been
plain
in
the
face
which
once
had
been
so
soft
for
him
asked
you
christabel
said
you
had
lost
something
no
nothing
she
let
out
a
small
piercing
shriek
lying
lying
but
why
should
i
care
you
done
that
for
years
and
rose
has
been
so
kind
has
she
coming
to
see
me
every
week
take
your
letter
francis
yes
i
read
it
i
do
care
i
helpless
take
it
from
its
under
the
coverlet
she
drew
the
letter
and
threw
it
at
him
it
fluttered
feebly
to
the
ground
she
had
made
a
tremendous
effort
trying
to
fling
it
in
his
face
and
it
had
fallen
as
mildly
as
a
snowflake
she
began
to
sob
this
was
the
climax
of
her
suffering
that
it
should
fall
like
that
he
picked
it
up
and
read
it
it
was
no
good
trying
to
explain
for
one
explanation
would
only
necessitate
another
he
was
deeply
in
the
mire
they
were
both
they
were
all
in
it
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
get
anybody
out
but
he
had
to
stop
that
sobbing
somehow
his
pity
for
christabel
swelled
into
his
biggest
feeling
he
crumpled
the
letter
angrily
and
at
the
sound
she
held
her
breathing
for
a
moment
of
course
she
should
have
crumpled
the
letter
and
then
she
might
have
hit
him
with
it
wish
to
god
i
never
seen
her
she
heard
him
say
with
despairing
anger
and
then
more
gently
cry
christabel
i
ca
bear
to
hear
you
the
letter
nothing
i
shall
never
meet
her
again
i
must
take
more
care
of
you
he
took
her
hand
and
stroked
it
he
would
never
meet
rose
again
but
he
had
an
appointment
with
henrietta
promise
but
no
it
does
matter
if
you
love
her
do
love
her
you
did
he
passed
his
free
hand
across
his
forehead
no
he
would
not
keep
that
appointment
with
henrietta
or
he
would
only
keep
it
to
tell
her
it
was
impossible
he
could
not
go
with
this
wailing
in
his
ears
and
he
knew
that
piteous
sound
was
his
salvation
it
gave
him
the
strength
to
appear
weak
cry
it
all
right
christabel
look
burn
the
confounded
letter
and
i
swear
it
the
only
one
i
ever
had
from
her
was
to
rose
he
admitted
miserably
that
he
owed
the
possibility
of
telling
that
truth
her
weeping
became
quieter
her
she
articulated
never
want
to
see
her
again
he
said
petulantly
i
just
told
you
i
never
want
to
meet
her
write
write
i
do
mind
henrietta
he
almost
shouted
henrietta
either
she
turned
to
him
a
face
ravaged
with
tears
and
misery
not
henrietta
she
whispered
hate
the
lot
of
them
he
muttered
all
witches
she
laughed
joyously
what
i
said
myself
she
gave
him
both
her
thin
hot
hands
to
hold
it
worth
while
all
this
if
you
are
going
to
be
good
to
me
he
kissed
her
then
as
the
sinner
kisses
the
saint
who
has
wrought
a
miracle
of
salvation
for
him
had
bad
luck
he
murmured
had
the
worst
of
it
he
stroked
her
cheek
little
thing
once
out
of
sight
of
the
two
standing
in
the
lane
rose
rode
home
quickly
she
felt
she
had
a
great
deal
to
do
but
she
did
not
know
what
it
was
her
head
was
hot
with
the
turmoil
of
her
thoughts
there
was
no
order
in
them
the
past
was
mixed
with
the
present
the
done
with
the
undone
she
was
assailed
by
the
awful
conviction
that
right
was
prolific
in
producing
wrong
if
she
had
not
preserved
her
own
physical
integrity
these
two
who
were
almost
like
her
children
yes
that
was
how
she
felt
towards
them
would
not
have
been
tempted
to
such
folly
for
it
was
folly
they
did
not
love
each
other
and
she
remembered
with
a
sickening
pang
the
expression
with
which
francis
had
looked
at
her
she
told
herself
he
loved
her
still
he
had
never
loved
anybody
else
and
she
had
only
pity
and
protection
and
a
fondness
to
give
him
in
return
she
cared
more
passionately
for
henrietta
who
was
now
the
victim
of
the
superficial
chastity
on
which
rose
had
insisted
if
she
had
known
that
henrietta
was
to
suffer
she
would
have
subdued
her
niceness
for
if
francis
had
been
in
physical
possession
of
her
body
she
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
possessing
his
mind
holding
nothing
back
she
could
also
have
held
him
securely
she
did
not
want
him
but
henrietta
would
have
been
saved
but
then
rose
had
not
known
how
could
she
and
henrietta
might
be
saved
yet
she
must
be
saved
the
obvious
method
was
to
lay
siege
to
the
facile
heart
of
francis
but
there
was
no
time
for
that
rose
was
not
deceived
by
enigmatic
words
they
were
tired
of
meeting
stealthily
she
had
said
what
did
that
mean
her
head
grew
hotter
she
had
to
force
herself
into
calm
and
the
old
man
at
the
on
the
bridge
received
her
visual
greeting
as
she
passed
but
as
she
went
slowly
to
the
stables
there
was
added
to
her
anxiety
the
thrilling
knowledge
that
at
last
and
for
the
first
time
she
was
going
to
take
definite
action
her
whole
life
had
been
a
long
and
dull
preparation
for
this
day
she
began
to
take
a
pleasure
in
her
excitement
she
had
something
to
do
she
was
delivered
from
the
monotony
of
thought
on
her
way
from
the
stables
she
met
charles
batty
going
home
for
his
midday
meal
and
she
stopped
him
she
said
she
presented
to
his
appreciative
eyes
a
very
elegant
figure
in
the
habit
looped
up
to
show
her
high
slim
boots
with
her
thick
plait
of
hair
under
the
hard
hat
her
complexion
defying
the
whiteness
of
her
stock
while
to
her
he
appeared
with
something
of
the
aspect
of
an
angel
in
a
long
top
coat
and
a
hat
at
the
back
of
his
head
she
said
again
tapping
her
boot
with
her
whip
in
trouble
would
you
mind
walking
home
by
the
hill
i
want
you
to
help
me
but
i
ca
tell
you
how
not
yet
he
walked
beside
her
without
speaking
and
they
came
to
the
place
where
he
had
stood
with
henrietta
and
she
had
flouted
him
whither
she
had
wandered
on
her
first
day
in
radstowe
that
high
point
overlooking
the
gorge
the
rocks
the
trees
the
river
that
scene
of
which
not
charles
nor
rose
nor
henrietta
could
ever
tire
yet
she
repeated
you
meet
me
this
afternoon
here
he
remonstrated
henrietta
found
out
she
had
not
time
to
smile
for
her
sake
do
anything
he
said
will
you
meet
me
this
afternoon
at
five
not
here
i
may
not
be
able
to
get
so
far
where
can
we
meet
there
the
ca
mistake
that
no
i
may
have
something
important
very
important
charles
to
say
to
you
at
five
will
you
be
on
the
green
there
a
seat
by
the
old
monument
it
wo
take
a
minute
to
get
there
are
you
listening
on
the
green
at
five
come
towards
me
as
soon
as
you
see
me
and
at
once
we
walk
together
towards
the
avenue
wait
till
six
and
if
i
do
come
will
you
still
hold
yourself
in
readiness
at
home
do
forget
do
be
and
forget
what
you
are
there
for
and
even
if
there
a
playing
dreadful
tunes
you
wait
there
for
henrietta
do
understand
this
about
henrietta
does
matter
not
in
the
least
now
what
are
your
instructions
he
repeated
them
well
i
trust
you
they
separated
and
she
went
home
a
little
amused
by
her
melodramatic
conduct
but
much
comforted
by
the
fact
that
charles
though
ignorant
of
his
part
was
with
her
in
this
conspiracy
she
was
met
by
reproaches
from
sophia
rose
riding
on
such
a
day
and
henrietta
out
too
suppose
wanted
something
from
the
chemist
you
did
did
you
and
there
are
four
servants
in
the
house
how
is
caroline
now
quiet
oh
rose
she
very
she
lets
me
do
anything
i
like
she
has
a
fault
to
find
with
me
henrietta
sit
with
her
this
afternoon
while
nurse
is
out
no
rose
i
must
do
what
i
can
for
her
should
like
henrietta
to
feel
she
is
needed
do
think
caroline
would
be
pleased
i
see
what
she
says
caroline
was
distressingly
indifferent
but
as
henrietta
went
to
her
room
on
her
return
and
sent
a
message
that
she
had
a
headache
and
did
not
want
any
food
she
was
left
undisturbed
sophia
became
still
more
agitated
what
was
the
matter
with
the
child
it
would
be
terrible
if
she
were
ill
too
would
rose
go
and
take
her
temperature
no
rose
was
sure
henrietta
would
not
care
for
that
she
had
better
be
left
to
sleep
if
only
she
could
be
put
to
sleep
for
a
few
days
now
that
she
was
in
the
house
and
locked
into
her
room
rose
was
alarmed
she
was
afraid
she
had
done
wrong
in
making
that
confession
she
had
played
what
seemed
to
be
her
strongest
card
but
she
had
played
it
in
the
wrong
way
at
the
wrong
moment
she
had
surely
roused
the
girl
antagonism
and
rivalry
and
there
came
to
rose
memory
many
little
scenes
in
which
reginald
mallett
crossed
in
his
desires
or
irritated
by
reproaches
had
suddenly
stopped
his
storming
set
his
stubborn
mouth
and
left
the
house
only
to
return
when
need
drove
him
home
but
if
henrietta
went
and
rose
had
no
doubt
of
her
intention
she
would
not
come
back
she
had
the
unbending
pride
of
her
class
and
rose
fear
was
changed
into
a
sense
of
approaching
desolation
the
house
would
be
unbearable
without
henrietta
rose
stood
on
the
landing
listening
to
the
small
sounds
from
room
and
the
unbroken
silence
from
henrietta
if
that
room
became
empty
the
house
would
be
empty
too
there
would
be
no
swift
footsteps
up
and
down
the
stairs
no
bursts
of
singing
no
laughter
she
must
not
go
she
could
not
be
spared
for
a
moment
rose
forgot
francis
sales
share
in
the
adventure
she
could
only
think
of
her
own
impending
loneliness
she
went
quickly
down
the
stairs
and
sat
in
the
leaving
the
door
open
and
after
an
hour
or
so
she
heard
stealthy
sounds
from
the
room
above
drawers
were
opened
carefully
and
henrietta
in
slipperless
feet
padded
across
the
floor
rose
looked
at
her
watch
and
rang
the
bell
take
a
tray
to
miss
henrietta
room
she
told
susan
tea
and
sandwiches
and
yes
an
egg
she
had
no
luncheon
a
good
substantial
tea
please
susan
if
the
child
were
anticipating
a
journey
she
must
be
fed
a
little
later
she
heard
susan
knock
at
henrietta
door
it
was
not
opened
but
the
tray
was
deposited
outside
with
a
slight
rattle
of
china
and
susan
voice
mildly
reproachful
exhorted
miss
henrietta
to
eat
and
drink
at
four
the
tray
was
still
lying
there
untouched
this
meant
that
henrietta
was
in
no
hurry
or
that
she
was
too
indignant
to
eat
but
it
might
also
mean
that
she
had
no
time
only
four
and
charles
batty
was
not
due
till
five
he
might
be
there
already
in
his
place
she
would
have
been
there
but
men
were
painfully
exact
and
five
was
the
hour
she
had
named
but
again
charles
batty
was
not
an
ordinary
man
trusting
to
that
fact
she
went
to
her
room
and
provided
herself
with
money
and
having
listened
without
a
qualm
at
henrietta
door
she
ran
out
of
the
house
the
church
facing
the
green
sounded
the
and
there
on
the
seat
by
the
old
stone
sat
charles
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
in
a
manner
likely
to
rouse
suspicions

of

he
held
it
loosely

been
playing
the
merry
peasant
for
half
an
hour
he
said

here
again
take
care
of

repeated

in
your
head
oh
charles

is
your
chance
it
i
shall
miss
it
i
always
do
the
wrong
thing
she
smiled
at
him
eagerly
imperiously
trying
to
endue
him
with
her
own
spirit
here
in
the
shadow
i
do
think
you
will
have
long
to
wait
and
if
you
get
your
chance
if
you
have
to
talk
to
her
do
scold

she
that
scolds
she
bullies

she
repeated
gaily
he
peered
down
at
her
you
are
rather
like
her
in
the
face
specially
when
you
laugh
better
looking
though
he
added
mournfully
tell
her
that
i
well
i
do
suppose
i
shall
think
of
it
again
that
for
you
she
is
the
best
and
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
you
can
tell
her
that
best
and
most
beautiful
yes
he
said
right
but
see
i
lose
her
bound
to
he
muttered
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
bring
her
home
she
said
firmly
and
she
left
him
standing
monumentally
with
his
hat
awry
charles
stood
obediently
in
the
place
assigned
to
him
where
the
shelter
of
the
malleus
garden
wall
made
his
own
bulk
less
conspicuous
and
whence
he
could
see
the
gate
the
night
was
mild
but
a
little
wind
had
risen
gently
rocking
the
branches
of
the
trees
which
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
street
lamps
cast
their
shadows
monstrously
on
the
pavements
their
movements
gradually
resolved
themselves
into
melody
in
charles
batty
mind
the
beauty
of
the
reflected
and
exaggerated
twigs
and
branches
was
not
consciously
realized
by
his
eyes
but
the
swaying
the
sudden
ceasing
and
the
resumption
of
that
delicate
agitation
became
music
in
his
ears
he
too
swayed
slightly
on
his
big
feet
and
forgot
his
business
to
remember
it
with
a
jerk
and
a
fear
that
henrietta
had
escaped
him
rose
had
told
him
he
must
not
make
music
in
his
head
how
had
she
known
he
would
want
to
do
that
she
must
have
some
faculty
denied
to
him
the
same
faculty
which
warned
her
that
henrietta
was
going
to
do
something
strange
he
felt
in
his
pocket
to
assure
himself
of
the
money
safety
he
rearranged
his
hat
and
determined
to
concentrate
on
watching
the
pain
which
varying
in
degrees
always
lived
in
his
bosom
the
pain
of
misunderstanding
and
being
misunderstood
of
doing
the
wrong
thing
of
meaning
well
and
acting
ill
became
acute
he
was
bound
to
make
a
mistake
he
would
lose
henrietta
or
incense
her
though
now
he
was
more
earnest
to
do
wisely
than
he
had
ever
been
he
had
told
her
he
was
going
to
make
an
art
of
love
but
he
knew
that
art
was
far
from
perfected
and
she
was
incapable
of
appreciating
mere
endeavour
he
was
afraid
of
her
but
he
was
more
afraid
of
failing
the
music
tripped
in
his
head
but
he
would
not
listen
to
it
he
strained
his
ears
for
the
opening
of
the
malletts
door
and
just
as
the
sound
of
the
clock
striking
two
steady
notes
for
five
was
fading
as
though
it
were
being
carried
on
the
light
wings
of
the
wind
over
the
big
trees
over
the
green
across
the
gorge
across
the
woods
to
the
essential
country
he
heard
a
faint
thud
a
patter
of
feet
and
the
turning
of
the
handle
of
the
gate
he
stepped
back
lest
she
should
be
going
to
pass
him
but
she
turned
the
other
way
walking
quickly
with
a
small
bag
in
her
hand
going
away
charles
said
to
himself
with
perspicacity
and
now
for
the
first
time
he
knew
what
her
absence
would
mean
to
him
she
did
not
love
him
she
mocked
and
despised
him
but
the
malletts
house
had
held
her
and
several
times
a
day
he
had
been
able
to
pass
and
tell
himself
she
was
there
now
with
the
sad
little
bag
in
her
hand
she
was
not
only
in
personal
danger
she
threatened
his
whole
life
he
followed
not
too
close
her
haste
did
not
destroy
the
beauty
of
her
carriage
her
body
did
not
hang
over
her
feet
teaching
them
the
way
to
go
it
was
straight
like
a
young
tree
he
had
never
really
looked
at
her
before
he
had
never
had
a
mind
empty
of
everything
except
the
consideration
of
her
and
now
he
was
puzzled
by
some
difference
in
his
desire
to
discover
what
it
was
he
drew
indiscreetly
close
to
her
and
though
a
quick
turn
of
her
head
reminded
him
of
his
duty
to
see
and
not
to
be
seen
he
had
made
his
discovery
her
clothes
were
different
they
were
shabby
and
searching
for
an
explanation
he
found
the
right
one
she
was
wearing
the
clothes
in
which
she
had
arrived
at
nelson
lodge
he
remembered
in
books
it
was
what
fugitives
always
did
they
discarded
their
rich
clothes
and
they
left
a
note
on
the
it
was
her
way
of
shaking
the
dust
from
her
feet
and
with
a
rush
of
feeling
in
which
he
forgot
himself
he
experienced
a
new
protective
tenderness
for
her
he
realized
that
she
too
might
be
unhappy
and
it
seemed
that
it
was
he
who
ought
to
comfort
her
he
who
could
do
it
he
had
to
put
a
drag
on
his
steps
as
they
tried
to
hurry
after
her
through
the
main
street
of
upper
radstowe
through
another
darker
one
where
there
were
fewer
people
and
he
had
to
exercise
more
care
and
so
past
the
big
square
where
tall
old
houses
looked
at
each
other
across
an
enclosure
of
trees
down
to
a
broad
street
where
tramcars
rushed
and
rattled
she
boarded
one
of
these
and
went
inside
pulling
his
hat
farther
over
his
face
in
the
erroneous
belief
that
he
would
be
the
less
noticeable
he
ascended
to
the
top
to
crane
his
head
over
the
side
at
every
lest
henrietta
should
get
off
but
there
was
no
sign
of
her
until
they
reached
that
strange
place
in
the
middle
of
the
city
where
the
harbour
ran
into
the
streets
and
the
funnels
and
masts
of
ships
mingled
with
the
roofs
of
houses
this
was
the
spot
where
round
a
big
triangle
of
paving
tramcars
came
and
went
in
every
direction
and
here
everybody
must
alight
the
streets
were
brilliant
with
electricity
electric
signs
popped
magically
with
lights
on
the
front
of
a
music
hall
where
an
audience
was
already
gathering
for
the
first
performance
on
on
the
big
red
warehouses
on
the
quay
the
lighted
tramcars
with
passengers
inside
looked
like
slides
and
amid
all
the
people
using
the
triangle
as
a
promenade
or
hurrying
here
and
there
on
business
the
newsboys
shouting
and
the
general
bustle
charles
did
not
know
whether
to
be
more
afraid
of
losing
henrietta
or
colliding
with
her
but
now
his
faculties
were
alert
and
he
used
more
discretion
than
was
necessary
for
henrietta
under
the
influence
of
that
instinct
which
persuades
that
not
seeing
is
a
precaution
against
being
seen
was
scrupulous
in
avoiding
the
encounter
of
any
eye
he
followed
her
to
another
tramcar
which
would
take
her
to
the
station
he
followed
her
when
she
alighted
once
more
and
seeing
her
change
that
bag
from
one
hand
to
another
as
though
she
found
it
heavy
he
let
out
a
groan
so
loud
and
heartfelt
that
it
aroused
the
pity
of
a
but
he
was
really
luxuriating
in
his
sorrow
for
her
it
was
an
immense
relief
after
much
sorrowing
for
himself
and
it
induced
a
forgetfulness
of
everything
but
his
determination
to
help
her
it
was
easy
to
keep
her
in
sight
while
she
went
up
the
broad
approach
to
the
dull
crowded
badly
lighted
and
dirty
station
it
was
harder
to
get
near
enough
to
hear
what
ticket
she
demanded
he
did
not
hear
but
again
he
followed
the
little
shabby
yet
somehow
elegant
figure
and
he
took
a
place
in
the
compartment
next
to
the
one
she
chose
it
was
the
london
train
and
he
found
himself
hoping
she
was
not
going
so
far
he
felt
that
to
see
her
disappearing
into
that
house
of
which
he
had
the
address
in
his
pocket
would
be
like
seeing
her
disappear
for
ever
he
would
lose
his
chance
of
helping
her
or
rather
she
would
lose
her
chance
of
being
helped
a
slightly
different
aspect
of
the
affair
and
the
one
on
which
he
had
set
his
mind
he
had
taken
a
ticket
for
the
first
stop
and
when
the
train
slowed
down
for
the
station
of
that
neighbouring
city
he
had
his
head
out
of
the
window
an
old
gentleman
with
a
noisy
cold
protested
could
he
not
wait
until
the
train
actually
stopped
charles
was
afraid
he
could
not
be
so
obliging
he
assured
the
old
gentleman
that
the
night
was
mild
i
keeping
a
good
deal
of
the
draught
out
he
said
pleasantly
he
saw
a
small
hand
on
the
door
of
the
next
compartment
then
the
sleeve
of
a
black
coat
as
henrietta
stretched
for
the
handle
and
he
said
to
himself
was
in
mourning
for
her
mother
he
was
proud
of
remembering
that
he
had
a
sense
of
nearness
and
a
slow
suspicion
that
hitherto
he
had
not
sufficiently
considered
her
in
their
past
intercourse
he
had
been
trying
to
stamp
his
own
thoughts
on
her
mind
but
now
it
seemed
that
something
of
her
more
real
than
her
physical
beauty
was
being
impressed
on
him
he
wanted
to
know
what
she
was
feeling
not
in
regard
to
him
but
in
regard
for
instance
to
that
dead
mother
and
why
she
ran
away
like
this
in
her
old
clothes
and
with
the
little
bag
she
was
out
of
the
train
she
had
descended
the
steps
to
the
roadway
and
there
she
looked
about
her
hesitating
cabmen
hailed
her
but
ignoring
them
and
crossing
the
tramlines
she
began
to
walk
slowly
up
a
dull
street
where
cards
in
the
house
windows
told
of
lodgings
to
be
let
if
she
knocked
at
one
of
these
doors
what
was
he
to
do
but
she
did
not
look
at
the
houses
her
head
was
drooping
a
little
her
feet
moved
reluctantly
she
was
no
longer
eager
and
her
bag
was
heavy
again
she
had
changed
it
from
the
right
to
the
left
hand
and
then
unexpectedly
she
quickened
her
pace
the
naturally
unobservant
charles
divined
a
cause
and
looking
for
it
he
saw
with
a
shock
of
surprise
and
horror
the
tall
figure
of
a
man
at
the
end
of
the
street
she
was
hastening
towards
him
charles
stood
a
man
he
had
not
thought
of
that
he
had
positively
never
thought
of
it
nor
had
he
guessed
at
his
capacity
for
jealousy
and
anger
then
this
was
why
rose
mallett
had
sent
him
on
this
mission
it
was
a
man
work
and
in
the
confusion
of
his
feelings
he
still
had
time
to
wish
he
had
spent
more
of
his
youth
in
the
exercise
of
his
muscles
he
braced
himself
for
an
encounter
but
already
henrietta
had
swerved
aside
this
was
not
the
man
she
was
to
meet
her
expectation
had
misled
her
but
the
acute
charles
surmised
that
the
man
she
looked
for
would
also
be
tall
and
slim
tall
and
slim
he
repeated
the
words
so
that
he
should
make
no
mistake
but
subconsciously
they
had
roused
memories
and
instead
of
that
little
black
figure
hurrying
on
in
front
of
him
he
saw
a
young
woman
clothed
in
yellow
entering
from
the
frosty
night
with
brilliant
half
veiled
eyes
and
by
the
side
of
her
was
francis
sales
again
he
stood
still
as
much
in
amazement
at
his
own
folly
as
in
any
other
feeling
francis
sales
the
fellow
who
could
dance
who
murdered
music
and
little
birds
and
he
had
a
wife
charles
was
not
shocked
if
henrietta
had
wished
to
elope
with
a
great
musician
wived
though
he
might
be
charles
could
have
let
her
go
subduing
his
own
pangs
not
for
her
own
sake
but
for
that
of
a
man
more
important
than
himself
but
he
would
not
yield
the
claims
of
his
devotion
to
francis
sales
he
should
not
have
her
he
walked
on
quickly
taking
no
precautions
he
had
lost
sight
of
henrietta
and
he
could
not
even
hear
the
sound
of
her
steps
yet
he
had
no
doubt
but
he
would
find
her
and
she
was
not
far
to
seek
a
turn
of
the
road
brought
him
under
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
and
in
the
paved
square
surrounded
by
old
houses
in
which
it
stood
he
saw
her
apparently
at
that
moment
she
also
saw
him
for
with
an
incredibly
swift
movement
and
a
furtiveness
which
wrung
his
heart
she
slipped
into
the
porch
and
disappeared
he
followed
the
door
was
unlocked
and
she
had
passed
through
it
but
he
lingered
there
fancying
he
could
smell
the
faint
sweetness
of
her
presence
within
the
organ
was
booming
softly
and
in
that
sound
he
forgot
for
a
moment
the
necessity
for
action
the
music
seemed
to
be
wonderfully
complicated
with
the
waft
of
henrietta
passage
with
his
love
for
her
with
all
he
imagined
her
to
be
but
the
forgetfulness
was
only
for
that
moment
and
he
pushed
open
the
door
the
place
was
dimly
lighted
two
candles
like
stars
twinkled
on
the
distant
altar
a
few
people
sat
in
the
darkness
with
an
extraordinary
effect
of
personal
sorrow
this
was
not
where
happy
people
came
to
offer
thanks
it
was
a
refuge
for
the
afflicted
a
temporary
harbour
for
the
weary
they
did
not
seem
to
pray
they
sat
relaxed
wrapped
in
the
antique
peace
the
warm
musty
smell
of
the
building
sitting
with
the
stillness
of
their
desire
to
preserve
this
safety
which
was
theirs
only
for
a
little
while
their
dull
clothes
mixed
with
the
shadows
the
old
oak
the
worn
stone
and
the
voice
of
the
organ
was
like
the
voice
of
multitudes
of
sad
souls
very
soon
the
music
ceased
with
a
kind
of
sob
and
the
verger
with
his
skirts
flapping
round
his
feet
came
to
warn
those
isolated
human
creatures
that
they
must
face
the
world
again
they
rose
obediently
but
henrietta
did
not
move
as
though
she
alone
of
that
company
had
not
learnt
the
lesson
of
necessity
but
the
altar
lights
were
now
extinguished
the
skirted
verger
was
approaching
her
and
charles
forestalled
him
he
murmured
she
looked
up
without
surprise
time
is
it
she
asked
she
rose
picking
up
her
bag
me
have
that
he
said
no
she
answered
absently
and
then
it
really
seven
there
the
clock
striking
now
the
sound
of
the
seven
notes
whirred
and
then
clanged
above
their
heads
must
go
he
said
locking
up
the
air
was
cold
and
damp
after
the
warmth
of
the
church
and
henrietta
stood
shivering
a
little
and
looking
round
her
hungry
charles
batty
said
you
come
and
have
dinner
with
me
she
replied
shall
stay
here
long
for
do
know
and
sharply
she
turned
on
him
and
asked
are
you
doing
here
come
here
sometimes
there
are
concerts
be
late
then
if
you
are
going
to
dine
know
but
i
hungry
you
ca
listen
to
music
if
you
hungry
let
have
dinner
first
the
square
was
deserted
the
lights
in
the
little
shops
where
old
furniture
and
lace
and
jewels
were
sold
were
all
put
out
and
the
large
policeman
who
had
been
standing
at
the
corner
had
moved
away
do
want
anything
to
eat
she
said
she
dropped
the
bag
and
covered
her
face
with
both
her
hands
she
was
going
to
cry
but
he
was
not
afraid
he
was
rather
glad
and
not
without
pleasure
at
his
own
daring
he
removed
a
hand
tucked
it
under
his
arm
and
said
along
she
struggled
ca
i
must
go
to
london
if
you
want
to
help
me
you
find
out
about
the
trains
i
can
go
to
banks
i
ca
go
back
to
radstowe
he
said
firmly
and
have
dinner
and
we
talk
about
it
you
promise
to
help
me
nothing
i
want
to
do
so
much
he
said
must
forget
the
bag
quiet
charles
she
murmured
good
he
emended
she
looked
down
old
clothes
does
matter
what
you
wear
he
told
her
always
look
different
from
anybody
else
i
and
i
am
i
am
i
much
worse
and
nobody
she
almost
sobbed
so
unhappy
charles
will
you
wait
here
for
a
minute
i
must
just
just
walk
round
the
square
come
back
she
nodded
and
he
kept
the
bag
as
hostage
the
large
policeman
had
strolled
back
he
saw
the
tall
young
man
standing
over
the
bag
and
thought
it
would
be
well
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
but
charles
did
not
notice
the
policeman
his
whole
attention
was
for
henrietta
reappearance
she
would
come
back
because
she
had
said
she
would
but
if
she
did
not
come
alone
there
would
be
trouble
he
did
not
however
expect
to
see
francis
sales
he
gathered
that
sales
had
failed
her
and
he
was
sorry
he
would
have
beaten
him
somehow
he
would
have
conquered
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
now
he
felt
that
his
task
was
going
to
be
too
easy
he
wished
he
could
have
sweated
and
panted
in
the
doing
of
it
and
when
henrietta
returned
alone
walking
with
an
angry
swiftness
he
felt
a
genuine
regret
along
charles
she
said
briskly
us
have
dinner
he
could
see
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
looking
past
him
her
lips
had
a
fixed
smile
and
he
wished
she
would
cry
again
is
crying
inside
he
told
himself
he
moved
forward
beside
her
vaguely
the
tenderness
of
his
love
for
her
was
like
a
powerful
warm
wave
sweeping
over
him
and
making
him
helpless
for
the
time
he
could
do
nothing
against
it
he
had
to
be
carried
with
it
but
suddenly
it
receded
leaving
him
high
and
dry
and
unromantically
in
contact
with
a
his
hat
had
fallen
off
are
you
doing
henrietta
asked
irritably
he
rubbed
his
head
it
i
was
thinking
about
you
were
you
thinking
she
asked
defiantly
well
he
said
she
laughed
you
hopeless
i
not
he
stooped
for
his
hat
and
picked
it
up
he
repeated
strongly
the
place
they
had
turned
into
a
busy
street
hope
there
wo
be
a
band
hope
there
will
be
i
want
noises
hideous
noises
going
to
get
them
he
sighed
as
he
pushed
open
the
and
received
in
his
ears
the
fierce
banging
braying
and
shrieking
of
various
instruments
played
in
a
frenzy
by
a
group
of
musicians
confined
as
if
for
the
public
safety
in
a
small
gallery
at
the
end
of
the
room
large
and
encumbered
by
the
bag
he
stood
obstructing
the
waiters
in
the
passage
between
the
tables
like
wild
beasts
in
a
cage
he
said
in
the
loud
voice
of
his
anger
you
stand
it
yes
yes
let
us
sit
here
in
this
corner
he
was
ridiculous
she
thought
yet
unconscious
of
any
absurdity
himself
he
had
a
dignity
he
was
not
so
ugly
as
she
had
thought
his
somewhat
protruding
eyes
had
less
vacancy
and
though
his
tie
was
crooked
she
was
not
ashamed
of
him
nevertheless
she
said
as
he
sat
down
i
going
to
london
get
a
first
he
said
must
go
i
ca
go
back
to
radstowe
you
he
asked
unexpectedly
a
note
on
your
she
frowned
of
course
not
well
you
can
go
back
we
going
to
a
concert
together
quite
easy
i
told
you
you
were
different
from
everybody
else
and
then
remembering
rose
words
he
leaned
across
the
table
towards
her
most
beautiful
and
the
best
he
said
severely
here
the
soup
she
drank
it
looking
at
him
between
the
spoonfuls
this
was
the
man
who
had
talked
to
her
by
the
monks
pool
here
was
the
same
detachment
he
had
shown
then
and
though
the
act
of
taking
soup
was
not
poetical
though
the
band
blared
and
the
place
shone
with
many
lights
she
was
taken
back
to
that
night
among
the
trees
with
the
water
lying
darkly
at
her
feet
keeping
its
own
secrets
with
the
ducks
quacking
sleepily
and
unseen
and
the
water
rats
diving
with
a
silken
splash
she
seemed
to
be
recovering
something
she
had
lost
because
she
had
disregarded
it
something
she
wanted
not
for
use
but
for
the
sake
of
possessing
and
sometimes
looking
at
it
sternly
she
tried
not
to
think
of
francis
sales
who
had
deserted
her
she
might
have
known
he
would
desert
her
he
had
looked
at
aunt
rose
and
she
had
seen
him
weaken
yet
he
had
promised
he
was
that
kind
of
man
he
could
not
say
no
to
her
face
but
he
left
her
in
this
city
all
alone
her
lips
trembled
she
steadied
them
with
difficulty
she
was
determined
not
to
honour
him
with
so
much
as
a
memory
or
a
regret
but
there
came
forbidden
recollections
of
the
dance
of
the
terrace
and
of
her
hands
in
his
she
closed
her
eyes
and
a
tremor
delicious
horrible
ran
through
her
body
she
felt
the
strength
of
those
brown
muscular
hands
and
she
was
assailed
by
the
odour
of
wind
and
tobacco
that
clung
to
him
he
had
never
said
anything
worth
remembering
but
there
had
been
danger
and
excitement
in
his
presence
there
was
neither
in
the
neighbourhood
of
charles
yet
she
could
not
forget
his
words
she
opened
her
eyes
was
it
you
said
just
now
the
best
and
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
your
fish
is
getting
cold
she
ate
it
without
appetite
or
distaste
charles
know
he
said
he
tapped
himself
expect
you
got
it
all
wrong
perhaps
but
not
i
know
everything
does
it
feel
he
replied
they
laughed
together
but
as
though
with
that
laughter
the
door
to
emotion
had
been
opened
he
saw
tears
start
into
her
eyes
he
begged
no
need
to
cry
she
laughed
again
got
to
cry
some
time
we
going
home
then
we
going
home
in
a
car
we
she
said
pleased
as
a
child
what
about
london
charles
i
have
to
go
here
some
chicken
ca
go
back
you
have
left
a
note
it
easy
you
and
i
have
just
been
to
a
concert
you
promised
me
that
long
ago
she
uttered
no
more
protests
she
ate
and
drank
obediently
glad
to
be
cared
for
and
when
the
meal
was
over
she
told
him
gratefully
have
been
good
you
never
said
another
word
about
the
band
and
it
has
made
even
my
head
ache
i
forgot
about
it
he
stared
at
her
in
amazement
forgot
about
it
i
did
hear
it
good
heavens
but
come
away
quickly
before
i
begin
remembering
that
they
might
be
able
to
tell
the
truth
they
went
to
the
concert
and
standing
at
the
back
of
the
hall
stayed
there
for
a
little
while
even
for
charles
the
music
was
only
a
covering
for
his
thoughts
henrietta
strangely
gentle
was
beside
him
but
he
dwelt
less
on
that
than
on
the
greater
marvel
of
the
new
power
he
felt
within
himself
she
might
laugh
at
him
she
might
mock
him
in
the
future
but
she
could
not
daunt
him
and
though
she
might
never
love
him
he
had
done
her
service
no
one
could
take
that
from
him
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
down
at
her
to
find
her
looking
up
at
him
a
little
puzzled
but
entirely
friendly
henrietta
he
whispered
loudly
transgressing
his
own
law
of
silence
and
evoking
an
indignant
hiss
from
an
enthusiastic
neighbour
he
blushed
with
shame
then
decided
that
he
could
not
really
care
and
signing
to
henrietta
to
follow
him
he
tiptoed
from
the
hall
you
hear
did
you
hear
he
asked
her
spoke
i
at
a
concert
i
never
done
that
in
my
life
before
i
never
do
it
again
but
then
it
was
the
first
time
you
ever
looked
at
me
like
that
henrietta
and
oh
lord
we
forgotten
the
bag
i
dare
not
go
back
for
it
leave
it
then
she
said
indifferently
do
want
to
see
it
again
i
like
it
it
an
old
friend
i
watched
it
he
checked
himself
go
wait
here
are
we
going
home
by
train
she
asked
when
he
returned
angry
man
did
see
me
he
said
triumphantly
because
well
you
wanted
somewhere
to
cry
did
you
in
the
closed
car
she
sat
for
a
time
very
straight
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
streets
and
the
people
but
when
they
had
drawn
away
from
the
old
city
and
left
its
grey
stone
houses
behind
and
taken
to
the
roads
where
slowly
moving
carts
were
creaking
and
snatches
of
talk
from
country
people
were
heard
and
lost
in
the
same
moment
she
sank
back
the
roads
were
dark
they
were
lined
by
tall
bare
trees
which
seemed
to
challenge
this
swift
passage
and
then
decide
to
permit
what
they
could
not
prevent
and
for
a
mile
or
so
the
river
gleamed
darkly
like
an
unsheathed
sword
in
the
night
shall
soon
be
there
sha
we
she
asked
in
a
small
voice
pretty
soon
wish
we
would
i
wish
we
could
go
on
like
this
for
ever
to
the
edge
of
the
world
and
then
drop
over
and
forget
he
sighed
he
could
not
arrange
that
for
her
but
he
told
the
man
to
drive
more
slowly
against
the
dark
upholstery
of
the
car
her
face
was
like
a
young
moon
wan
and
too
weary
for
its
work
he
slipped
his
arm
under
her
back
and
drew
her
to
him
pulling
off
her
hat
she
found
a
place
for
her
head
against
his
shoulder
and
he
shut
his
eyes
she
breathed
regularly
and
lightly
as
though
she
were
asleep
but
presently
she
said
i
do
mean
anything
by
this
but
you
are
the
only
friend
i
have
you
wo
think
i
mean
anything
will
you
he
shook
his
head
and
it
came
to
rest
on
hers
he
too
wished
they
might
go
on
like
this
for
ever
to
the
world
edge
the
car
was
stopped
at
a
little
distance
from
the
house
and
henrietta
had
to
rouse
herself
from
the
state
between
waking
and
sleeping
thought
and
imagery
in
which
she
had
passed
the
journey
the
jarring
of
the
brake
shocked
her
into
a
recognition
of
facts
and
the
gentle
humming
of
the
engine
reminded
her
that
life
had
to
go
on
as
before
the
persistent
sound
regular
not
loud
controlled
was
like
existence
in
nelson
lodge
one
wearied
of
it
yet
one
would
weary
more
of
accidents
breaking
the
healthy
beating
of
the
engine
had
been
one
of
the
accidents
and
she
was
terribly
tired
no
wonder
she
had
been
trying
to
run
away
with
a
man
who
did
not
want
her
a
man
who
had
a
lonely
miserable
invalid
for
a
wife
the
old
lover
of
aunt
rose
a
little
blaze
of
anger
flared
up
at
the
thought
of
rose
nevertheless
she
continued
her
she
had
been
willing
to
leave
her
aunts
without
a
word
and
they
had
been
good
to
her
and
one
of
them
was
ill
and
the
very
money
in
her
pocket
was
not
her
own
she
was
shocked
by
her
behaviour
she
was
like
her
father
who
took
what
belonged
to
other
people
and
used
it
badly
she
sat
flaccid
her
hands
loose
on
her
lap
she
felt
incapable
of
movement
but
charles
was
speaking
to
her
telling
her
to
get
out
and
run
home
quickly
she
looked
at
him
she
was
holding
his
friendly
hand
what
would
she
have
done
without
him
she
saw
herself
in
the
train
speeding
through
the
lonely
darkness
she
saw
herself
knocking
at
banks
door
felt
herself
clasped
to
the
doubtful
blackness
of
that
bosom
and
she
shuddered
must
go
charles
said
but
he
still
held
her
hand
he
had
brought
her
back
to
cleanliness
and
comfort
he
had
saved
her
from
behaviour
of
gross
ingratitude
he
had
been
marvellously
kind
and
wise
she
said
awful
it
all
right
we
been
to
a
concert
her
voice
sank
kept
that
promise
but
the
whole
thing
and
aunt
caroline
so
she
may
have
died
has
been
time
he
said
charles
it
only
takes
a
minute
run
home
quickly
this
bag
a
nuisance
he
said
but
he
looked
at
it
tenderly
how
he
had
dogged
that
bag
how
heavy
it
had
seemed
for
her
here
i
take
it
home
and
get
it
to
you
somehow
do
want
it
i
hate
it
he
thought
keep
it
then
and
aloud
he
said
wrap
the
things
up
in
a
parcel
and
let
you
have
them
nothing
you
do
want
me
to
see
is
there
nothing
right
do
get
out
dear
no
i
shall
drive
on
she
lingered
on
the
pavement
she
had
not
said
a
word
of
thanks
she
jumped
on
to
the
step
and
put
her
head
through
the
window
you
kind
charles
she
said
he
began
in
a
loud
voice
filling
the
dark
interior
with
sound
is
it
no
nothing
me
not
fair
he
said
weakness
good
night
be
quick
she
ran
along
the
street
and
gave
the
bell
a
gentle
push
to
her
relief
it
was
the
housemaid
and
not
susan
who
opened
to
her
susan
would
have
looked
at
her
severely
but
the
housemaid
had
a
welcoming
smile
an
offer
of
food
if
miss
henrietta
had
not
dined
henrietta
shook
her
head
she
was
going
to
bed
at
once
she
did
not
want
anything
to
eat
how
was
miss
caroline
so
well
miss
henrietta
the
doctor
been
again
and
there
a
come
henrietta
pressed
her
hands
against
her
heart
oh
good
charles
wonderful
charles
she
did
not
know
how
to
be
grateful
enough
she
moved
meekly
humbly
through
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
all
was
terribly
portentously
still
but
in
her
bedroom
there
were
no
signs
of
the
trouble
in
the
house
the
fire
was
lighted
her
evening
gown
had
been
laid
out
on
the
bed
her
silk
stockings
and
slippers
were
in
their
usual
places
nobody
had
suspected
nobody
had
been
alarmed
she
had
stolen
back
by
a
miracle
into
her
place
yes
charles
batty
was
a
miracle
there
was
no
other
word
for
him
and
by
contrast
the
image
of
francis
sales
appeared
mean
contemptible
why
had
he
failed
her
his
desertion
was
a
blessing
but
it
was
also
a
slight
and
perhaps
a
tribute
to
the
power
of
rose
yes
that
was
it
she
set
her
little
teeth
he
had
stared
at
aunt
rose
as
though
he
could
not
look
at
her
enough
not
with
the
starved
expression
she
had
first
intercepted
long
ago
but
with
a
look
of
wonder
almost
of
awe
she
was
nearly
yet
she
could
force
that
from
him
well
she
was
welcome
to
anything
he
could
give
her
his
offerings
were
no
compliment
henrietta
was
done
with
him
she
would
not
think
of
him
again
she
had
been
foolish
she
had
been
wicked
but
she
was
the
richer
and
the
wiser
for
her
experience
she
had
always
been
taught
that
sin
brought
suffering
yet
here
she
was
warm
and
comfortable
in
possession
of
a
salutary
lesson
and
with
the
good
charles
for
a
secure
friend
it
was
odd
unnatural
and
this
variation
in
her
case
gave
her
a
pleasant
feeling
of
being
a
special
person
for
whom
the
operation
of
natural
laws
could
be
diverted
by
the
weakness
of
francis
sales
and
the
strength
of
aunt
rose
whom
nevertheless
she
could
never
forgive
she
was
saved
from
much
unhappiness
and
if
her
mother
knew
everything
in
that
heaven
to
which
she
had
surely
gone
she
must
now
be
weeping
tears
of
thankfulness
yet
henrietta
future
lay
before
her
rather
drearily
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
legs
she
yawned
what
was
she
to
do
being
good
as
she
meant
to
be
and
realizing
her
sin
as
indeed
she
did
was
hardly
occupation
enough
for
all
her
energies
her
immediate
business
was
to
answer
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
rose
who
entered
her
natural
pallor
was
overlaid
by
the
whiteness
of
distress
henrietta
i
am
glad
you
have
come
in
been
to
a
concert
with
charles
batty
henrietta
said
quickly
rose
showed
no
interest
or
surprise
is
so
much
worse
henrietta
felt
a
pang
at
her
forgetfulness
is
very
ill
i
was
afraid
you
might
not
be
back
in
time
she
has
been
asking
for
you
been
to
wellsborough
to
a
concert
henrietta
insisted
she
as
bad
as
that
aunt
rose
but
she
get
better
wo
she
with
me
and
say
good
night
to
her
took
henrietta
hand
warm
you
are
she
said
in
wonder
that
anything
could
be
less
cold
than
caroline
soon
would
be
henrietta
fingers
tightened
round
the
living
hand
not
going
to
die
is
she
she
dying
rose
said
quietly
but
she
ca
henrietta
protested
does
want
to
hate
it
so
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
aunt
caroline
without
her
parties
without
her
clothes
she
would
find
it
intolerably
dull
to
be
dead
she
will
get
better
rose
said
nothing
they
crossed
the
landing
and
entered
the
dim
room
caroline
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
big
bed
with
her
hair
lank
and
uncurled
she
was
hardly
recognizable
and
strangely
ugly
her
body
seemed
to
have
dwindled
but
her
features
were
strong
and
harsh
and
henrietta
said
to
herself
is
the
real
aunt
caroline
not
what
i
thought
not
what
i
thought
i
never
seen
her
before
she
wondered
how
she
had
ever
dared
to
joke
with
her
she
had
been
a
funny
vain
old
woman
without
much
sensibility
immune
from
much
that
others
suffered
and
now
she
was
a
mere
human
creature
breathing
with
difficulty
and
in
pain
henrietta
stood
by
the
bed
saying
and
doing
nothing
rose
had
slipped
away
the
nurse
was
quietly
busy
at
a
table
and
aunt
sophia
was
kneeling
before
a
chair
with
her
elbows
on
the
cushioned
seat
her
face
in
her
hands
she
was
praying
it
was
as
bad
as
that
her
back
the
waist
the
thick
hair
looked
like
those
of
a
young
girl
she
was
praying
henrietta
looked
again
at
aunt
caroline
grey
face
and
saw
that
the
eyes
had
opened
the
lips
were
smiling
a
little
child
she
said
with
immense
difficulty
as
though
she
had
been
seeking
those
words
for
a
long
time
and
had
at
last
fitted
them
to
her
thought
sophia
stirred
dropped
her
hands
and
looked
round
the
nurse
came
forward
with
a
little
crackle
of
starched
clothes
good
night
to
her
and
go
henrietta
leaned
over
the
empty
space
of
bed
and
kissed
caroline
on
the
temple
night
dear
aunt
caroline
she
said
softly
there
was
no
answer
the
eyes
were
closed
again
and
the
harsh
breathing
went
on
cruelly
like
waves
falling
back
from
a
pebbled
shore
and
henrietta
felt
the
dampness
of
death
on
her
lips
no
aunt
caroline
would
not
get
better
she
died
in
the
early
morning
while
henrietta
slept
susan
entering
as
usual
with
henrietta
tea
did
not
say
a
word
she
knew
her
place
it
was
not
for
her
to
give
the
news
to
a
member
of
the
family
moreover
she
blamed
henrietta
for
miss
caroline
death
it
was
the
battys
ball
that
had
killed
miss
caroline
and
susan
stuck
to
her
belief
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
miss
henrietta
there
would
not
have
been
a
ball
sleepily
henrietta
watched
susan
draw
the
blinds
but
something
in
the
woman
slow
languid
movements
startled
her
into
wakefulness
her
dreams
dropped
back
into
their
place
she
had
been
sleeping
warmly
forgetfully
while
death
hovered
over
the
house
looking
for
a
way
in
she
sat
up
in
bed
caroline
susan
began
to
cry
but
in
spite
of
her
tears
and
her
distress
she
ejaculated
dutifully
henrietta
your
your
slippers
but
henrietta
had
rushed
forth
and
bounded
into
room
might
have
told
me
you
might
have
waked
me
rose
was
writing
at
her
desk
she
turned
on
your
henrietta
you
will
get
cold
i
came
into
your
room
but
you
were
fast
asleep
and
in
that
minute
it
was
all
over
the
big
things
happen
so
quickly
yes
that
was
true
quickly
one
fell
in
and
out
of
love
ran
away
from
home
returned
and
slept
and
waked
to
find
that
people
had
quickly
died
the
big
things
happened
quickly
but
the
little
ones
of
every
day
went
on
slow
feet
as
though
they
were
tired
of
themselves
was
somehow
a
comfort
rose
went
on
know
that
you
were
fast
asleep
but
living
you
never
moved
when
i
kissed
you
me
what
did
you
do
that
for
henrietta
asked
in
a
loud
voice
she
had
been
taken
unawares
by
the
woman
who
had
wronged
her
yet
she
was
touched
and
pleased
could
help
it
i
was
so
glad
to
have
you
there
and
you
looked
so
young
i
do
know
what
we
should
do
without
you
poor
sophia
and
oh
do
put
on
my
dear
yes
put
on
the
it
was
sophia
who
spoke
her
face
was
very
calm
she
actually
looked
younger
as
though
the
greatness
of
her
sorrow
had
removed
all
other
signs
like
a
fall
of
snow
hiding
the
scars
of
a
hillside
aunt
sophia
henrietta
went
forward
and
pressed
her
cheek
against
the
other
dear
but
you
must
go
and
dress
breakfast
is
ready
henrietta
was
a
little
shocked
that
aunt
sophia
who
was
naturally
sentimental
should
be
less
emotional
on
this
occasion
than
aunt
rose
but
she
was
also
awed
by
this
control
she
remembered
how
when
her
own
mother
died
banks
had
refused
to
take
solid
food
for
a
whole
day
and
the
recollection
braced
her
for
her
cold
bath
for
fresh
linen
for
emulation
of
aunt
sophia
for
everything
unlike
the
slovenly
weeping
of
banks
sitting
in
the
neglected
kitchen
with
a
grimy
on
her
lap
and
the
teapot
at
her
elbow
but
she
knew
that
the
banksian
manner
was
really
natural
to
her
and
the
mallett
control
the
acceptance
the
same
eating
of
breakfast
were
a
pose
a
falseness
oddly
better
than
her
sincerity
at
table
no
one
referred
to
caroline
they
were
practical
and
composed
and
afterwards
when
sophia
and
rose
were
closeted
together
making
arrangements
writing
letters
to
relatives
of
whom
henrietta
had
never
heard
interviewing
batty
and
a
husky
personage
in
black
henrietta
stole
upstairs
past
caroline
death
chamber
and
into
her
own
room
she
was
glad
to
find
the
pretty
housemaid
there
tidying
the
hearth
and
dusting
the
furniture
she
wanted
to
talk
to
somebody
and
the
pretty
housemaid
was
sympathetic
and
discreet
she
told
henrietta
inevitably
of
deaths
in
her
own
family
and
henrietta
was
interested
to
hear
how
the
housemaid
grandmother
had
died
actually
while
she
was
saying
her
prayers
you
could
have
a
better
end
than
that
could
you
miss
henrietta
suppose
not
henrietta
said
it
might
depend
on
what
you
were
praying
for
she
would
be
saying
the
usual
things
miss
henrietta
just
daily
bread
and
forgive
our
trespasses
there
was
no
harm
in
my
grandmother
it
was
her
husband
who
broke
his
neck
picking
apples
his
own
apples
she
said
hastily
now
poor
mrs
sales
has
gone
sales
miss
henrietta
i
thought
you
know
last
night
her
and
miss
caroline
together
she
implied
that
in
this
journey
they
would
be
company
for
each
other
henrietta
found
nothing
to
say
but
above
the
shock
of
pity
she
felt
for
the
woman
she
had
disliked
and
the
awe
induced
by
the
name
of
death
she
was
conscious
of
a
load
lifted
from
her
mind
she
had
not
been
deserted
her
charm
had
not
failed
it
was
the
approach
of
death
that
had
held
him
back
she
put
the
thought
away
lest
it
should
lead
to
others
of
which
she
would
be
ashamed
yet
she
felt
a
malicious
pleasure
lasting
only
for
a
second
at
remembering
that
downstairs
sat
aunt
rose
calmly
full
of
affairs
aunt
rose
for
whom
the
love
of
francis
sales
had
ceased
too
soon
and
suppressed
but
fermenting
was
the
idea
that
in
these
late
events
including
the
failure
of
her
escape
there
was
the
kind
hand
of
fate
at
that
very
moment
charles
batty
chose
to
call
a
parcel
miss
henrietta
and
he
would
like
to
see
you
ca
see
him
henrietta
said
him
tell
him
about
miss
caroline
she
had
already
drifted
away
from
charles
he
had
been
so
near
last
night
so
almost
dear
in
the
troubled
fog
of
her
distress
but
this
morning
she
had
drifted
and
between
them
there
was
a
shining
space
of
water
sparkling
hardly
but
she
spared
him
an
instant
of
gratitude
and
softness
his
part
in
her
life
was
like
that
to
a
sailor
of
some
lightship
eagerly
looked
for
in
the
darkness
of
strangely
diminished
consequence
in
the
clear
day
still
there
safely
anchored
but
with
half
its
significance
gone
ca
see
him
she
repeated
she
wanted
suddenly
to
see
aunt
rose
voices
no
longer
came
from
the
batty
genuinely
sad
in
the
loss
of
an
old
friend
had
gone
the
undertaker
had
tiptoed
off
to
his
gloomy
lair
and
henrietta
went
downstairs
but
when
she
saw
her
aunt
she
dared
not
ask
her
if
she
knew
about
christabel
sales
rose
had
a
look
of
invulnerability
perhaps
she
knew
but
it
was
impossible
to
ask
and
if
she
knew
it
had
made
no
difference
it
seemed
as
though
she
had
gone
beyond
the
reach
of
feeling
she
and
sophia
both
wore
white
masks
but
sophia
was
only
a
few
hours
old
and
rose
had
been
gradually
assumed
it
was
not
only
caroline
death
which
had
given
her
that
strange
calm
face
the
expression
had
grown
slowly
as
though
something
had
been
a
long
time
dying
yet
she
hardly
had
a
look
of
loss
she
seemed
to
be
in
possession
of
something
but
henrietta
could
not
understand
what
it
was
and
she
was
vaguely
afraid
it
was
aunt
sophia
who
in
spite
of
her
amazing
courage
had
an
air
of
desolation
and
there
was
no
rouge
on
her
cheeks
its
absence
made
henrietta
want
to
cry
she
did
cry
at
intervals
throughout
that
day
and
the
ones
that
followed
it
was
terrible
without
aunt
caroline
and
pitiful
to
see
aunt
sophia
keeping
up
her
dignity
among
relatives
who
seemed
to
appear
out
of
the
ground
like
snails
after
rain
and
who
might
have
been
part
of
the
permanent
henrietta
hated
the
mournful
looks
of
these
ancient
cousins
the
shaking
of
their
black
beads
their
sibilant
whisperings
and
in
their
presence
she
was
and
rather
rude
aunt
caroline
would
have
laughed
at
them
and
their
dowdy
clothes
that
smelt
of
camphor
but
it
seemed
as
though
no
one
would
ever
laugh
again
in
nelson
lodge
and
over
the
river
in
the
unsubdued
country
where
death
was
only
the
repayment
of
a
loan
there
was
another
house
with
lowered
blinds
and
voices
hushed
she
was
irritated
by
the
thought
of
it
of
the
consolatory
letters
francis
would
receive
of
the
emotions
he
would
display
or
conceal
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
sorry
that
in
death
as
in
life
christabel
should
be
lonely
her
large
and
lively
family
was
far
away
even
the
cat
had
gone
and
there
were
only
the
nurse
and
francis
and
the
little
dog
to
miss
her
in
a
sense
henrietta
missed
her
too
and
that
fair
region
of
fields
and
woods
which
had
been
as
though
blocked
by
that
helpless
body
now
lay
open
vast
full
of
possibilities
inviting
exploration
and
when
henrietta
looked
at
her
aunt
rose
it
was
with
the
jealous
eye
of
a
rival
adventurer
but
that
was
absurd
there
could
be
no
rivalry
between
them
henrietta
was
sure
of
that
and
she
tried
to
avoid
these
speculations
and
meanwhile
necessary
things
were
done
and
christabel
sales
and
caroline
mallett
were
buried
on
the
same
day
the
beaded
relatives
departed
not
to
reappear
until
the
next
death
in
the
family
and
rose
and
henrietta
both
perhaps
thinking
of
francis
sales
returning
to
his
big
empty
house
returned
with
sophia
to
a
nelson
lodge
oppressive
in
its
desolation
it
seemed
now
that
the
whole
business
of
life
there
the
servants
the
fires
the
delicate
meals
had
proceeded
solely
for
caroline
benefit
yet
everything
continued
as
before
the
machinery
went
on
running
smoothly
the
still
reflected
in
its
rich
surface
the
lights
of
candles
the
sheen
of
silver
the
pallor
of
flowers
nothing
was
neglected
everything
was
beautiful
and
exact
and
susan
had
carefully
arranged
the
chairs
so
that
the
vacant
space
should
not
be
emphasized
the
three
women
slipped
into
their
seats
without
a
word
the
soup
was
very
hot
according
to
caroline
instructions
but
the
cook
inspired
more
by
the
desire
to
give
pleasant
nutriment
than
by
tact
had
chosen
to
make
the
creamy
variety
which
was
favourite
and
as
each
mallett
took
up
her
spoon
she
had
a
vision
of
caroline
tasting
the
soup
with
the
thoughtfulness
of
a
connoisseur
and
proclaiming
it
perfect
to
the
last
grain
of
salt
ca
eat
it
sophia
said
faintly
in
this
almost
comic
realization
of
her
loss
she
showed
the
first
sign
of
weakness
she
rose
trembling
visibly
and
susan
anxious
for
the
preservation
of
the
decencies
opened
the
door
and
closed
it
on
her
faltering
figure
before
the
first
sob
shook
her
body
the
others
without
exchanging
a
single
glance
proceeded
with
the
meal
eating
little
each
eager
for
solitude
and
each
finding
it
unbearable
to
picture
sophia
up
there
in
the
bedroom
alone
she
does
want
us
rose
said
might
want
me
henrietta
replied
provocatively
and
for
answer
rose
smile
flickered
disconcertingly
across
the
and
her
voice
a
little
worn
said
quietly
go
and
see
the
bedroom
had
a
dreadful
neatness
it
smelt
of
disinfectant
furniture
polish
and
soap
and
sophia
from
the
big
armchair
said
mournfully
might
have
left
it
as
it
was
it
feels
like
lodgings
and
as
the
very
feebleness
of
her
outcry
smote
her
sense
and
waked
echoes
of
all
she
left
unsaid
her
mouth
fell
shapeless
and
she
cried
gone
in
a
tone
of
astonishment
and
horror
henrietta
sitting
on
a
little
stool
before
the
fire
listened
to
the
weeping
which
was
too
violent
for
sophia
strength
and
the
harsh
sound
reminded
her
of
aunt
caroline
difficult
breathing
it
seemed
as
though
the
noise
would
go
on
for
ever
she
counted
each
separate
sob
and
when
they
had
gradually
lessened
and
died
away
the
relief
was
like
the
ceasing
of
physical
pain
sophia
henrietta
said
has
to
die
sophia
heard
tears
glistened
on
her
cheeks
her
hair
was
disordered
she
looked
like
a
large
flaxen
doll
that
had
been
left
out
in
the
rain
for
a
long
time
each
person
only
once
she
whispered
does
get
used
to
it
and
caroline
she
struggled
to
sit
up
would
be
ashamed
of
me
for
this
might
pretend
to
be
but
she
like
it
really
do
know
sophia
murmured
had
such
character
you
never
believed
her
did
you
henrietta
when
she
made
out
she
had
been
had
been
indiscreet
i
never
believed
it
glad
of
that
it
was
a
fancy
of
hers
i
encouraged
her
in
it
afraid
but
it
made
her
happy
it
pleased
her
and
it
did
no
harm
i
suppose
nobody
believed
her
but
she
did
know
i
do
think
sit
here
doing
nothing
henrietta
i
suppose
i
ought
to
go
through
her
papers
she
never
destroyed
a
letter
i
might
begin
on
them
do
you
think
you
better
do
you
like
just
to
sit
here
and
talk
to
me
no
i
must
not
give
way
i
not
the
only
one
there
poor
francis
sales
if
he
married
rose
i
always
planned
that
he
should
marry
rose
and
of
course
we
ought
not
to
think
of
such
things
so
soon
but
the
thought
has
come
to
me
that
they
may
marry
after
all
henrietta
tightened
the
clasp
of
the
hands
on
her
knee
and
said
do
you
think
that
would
be
suitable
sophia
said
she
so
old
have
you
noticed
how
old
she
has
looked
lately
rose
old
sophia
manner
became
almost
haughty
has
nothing
to
do
with
age
my
only
doubt
is
whether
francis
sales
is
worthy
of
her
dear
caroline
used
to
say
she
ought
to
to
marry
a
king
she
has
married
anybody
henrietta
remarked
bitingly
sophia
said
serenely
malletts
do
marry
she
sighed
i
hope
you
will
henrietta
henrietta
said
sharply
sha
i
do
want
to
men
are
hateful
dear
child
not
all
of
them
perhaps
none
of
them
when
i
was
eighteen
she
hesitated
must
get
on
with
her
papers
she
stood
up
and
moved
towards
the
bureau
here
we
shared
the
drawers
we
shared
everything
she
stretched
out
her
hands
and
they
fell
heavily
taking
the
weight
of
her
body
with
them
against
the
shining
slope
of
wood
henrietta
who
had
been
gazing
moodily
at
the
fire
was
astonished
to
hear
the
thud
to
see
her
aunt
sophia
leaning
drunkenly
over
the
desk
sophia
lips
were
blue
her
eyes
were
glazed
and
henrietta
thought
dying
too
shall
i
let
her
die
but
at
the
same
moment
she
leapt
up
and
lowered
her
aunt
into
a
chair
my
heart
sophia
said
after
a
few
minutes
and
henrietta
understood
why
poor
aunt
sophia
always
went
upstairs
so
slowly
tell
anybody
no
one
knows
i
ought
not
to
have
cried
like
that
there
a
little
bottle
she
told
henrietta
to
fetch
it
from
a
secret
place
never
let
caroline
know
it
would
have
worried
her
and
after
all
she
was
the
first
to
go
i
glad
to
think
i
saved
her
that
anxiety
you
remember
how
she
teased
me
about
getting
tired
well
it
did
matter
and
she
liked
to
think
she
was
so
young
wherever
she
is
now
i
do
hope
she
is
feeling
angry
with
herself
she
thought
illness
was
so
vulgar
not
death
henrietta
said
not
death
and
henrietta
fancied
her
aunt
lingered
lovingly
on
the
word
must
be
a
secret
between
us
she
lay
back
exhausted
only
had
two
secrets
from
caroline
this
about
my
heart
was
one
henrietta
in
that
little
drawer
at
the
very
back
you
find
a
photograph
wrapped
in
find
it
for
me
dear
child
thank
you
she
held
it
tenderly
between
her
palms
was
the
other
it
the
picture
of
my
lover
henrietta
yes
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
some
one
once
loved
me
very
dearly
aunt
sophia
we
all
love
you
i
love
you
dearly
now
dear
yes
i
know
i
grateful
but
i
wanted
somebody
to
know
that
i
had
had
my
romance
and
have
it
still
all
these
years
but
i
was
loved
henrietta
till
he
died
and
i
was
very
young
then
younger
than
you
are
now
yes
i
wanted
somebody
to
know
that
poor
sophia
had
a
real
lover
once
he
went
away
to
america
to
make
a
fortune
for
me
but
he
died
i
have
been
wondering
since
caroline
went
if
she
and
he
have
met
if
so
perhaps
she
knows
perhaps
she
blames
me
but
i
think
she
will
laugh
not
now
i
hope
she
laughs
still
but
not
at
that
and
now
henrietta
we
put
the
photograph
into
the
fire
no
aunt
sophia
keep
it
still
child
i
may
die
at
any
moment
and
i
have
his
dear
face
by
heart
i
should
like
any
other
eyes
to
look
at
it
not
even
yours
stir
the
fire
henrietta
now
help
me
up
no
dear
i
would
rather
do
it
myself
she
knelt
her
faded
face
lighted
by
the
flames
which
consumed
her
greatest
treasure
her
back
still
girlish
her
slim
waist
girdled
with
a
black
ribbon
her
thick
knot
of
hair
resting
on
her
neck
henrietta
went
quietly
out
of
the
room
but
on
the
landing
she
wrung
her
hands
together
she
felt
herself
surrounded
by
death
decay
lost
love
sad
memories
she
was
too
young
for
this
house
she
had
a
longing
to
escape
into
sunshine
gaiety
and
pleasure
it
was
caroline
who
had
laughed
and
planned
it
was
she
who
had
made
the
place
a
home
rose
was
too
remote
sophia
was
living
in
the
past
and
henrietta
felt
herself
alone
even
her
father
portrait
looked
down
at
her
with
eyes
too
much
like
her
own
and
out
there
beyond
the
garden
the
roofs
and
the
river
there
was
only
francis
sales
and
he
was
not
a
friend
he
was
perhaps
a
lover
he
was
a
sensation
an
accident
but
he
was
not
a
companion
or
a
refuge
and
the
thought
of
charles
rose
up
at
that
moment
like
the
thought
of
a
fireside
she
wished
he
would
come
now
and
sit
with
her
asking
for
nothing
but
assuring
her
of
service
that
was
what
he
was
for
she
decided
you
could
not
love
charles
but
you
could
trust
him
for
ever
and
the
more
trust
he
was
given
the
more
he
grew
to
it
she
needed
him
she
must
not
lose
him
deep
in
her
heart
she
supposed
she
was
going
to
marry
francis
sales
yes
in
spite
of
what
aunt
sophia
said
and
it
was
a
prospect
towards
which
she
tiptoed
holding
her
breath
not
daring
to
look
but
she
like
rose
had
no
illusions
she
was
the
daughter
of
her
mother
union
with
her
father
and
she
was
prepared
for
trouble
for
the
need
of
charles
besides
she
liked
him
he
was
companionable
even
when
he
scolded
one
forgot
about
him
but
he
returned
he
was
there
she
went
to
bed
in
that
comfortable
assurance
there
could
be
no
more
parties
for
henrietta
that
winter
but
batty
house
was
always
open
to
her
and
batty
like
her
son
charles
could
be
relied
upon
for
welcome
and
for
relaxation
in
her
presence
henrietta
had
a
pleasant
sense
of
superiority
she
was
applauded
and
not
criticized
and
she
knew
she
could
give
comfort
as
well
as
get
it
batty
liked
to
talk
to
her
and
henrietta
could
sink
into
one
of
the
superlatively
cushioned
and
listen
or
not
as
she
chose
there
she
was
relieved
of
the
slight
but
persistent
strain
she
was
under
in
nelson
lodge
for
sophia
and
rose
had
standards
of
manner
conduct
and
speech
beyond
her
own
while
batty
though
they
existed
were
on
another
plane
henrietta
was
sure
of
herself
in
that
luxurious
overcrowded
decorated
and
scented
with
the
least
precious
of
batty
hothouse
flowers
and
somewhat
overheated
on
her
first
visit
after
caroline
death
batty
received
the
bereaved
niece
with
unction
poor
dear
she
murmured
and
whether
her
sympathy
was
for
caroline
or
henrietta
perhaps
she
did
not
know
herself
dear
i
ca
get
your
aunt
out
of
my
head
henrietta
love
there
she
was
at
the
party
looking
like
a
queen
well
you
know
what
i
mean
and
batty
said
she
was
the
belle
of
the
ball
it
was
just
his
joke
but
batty
never
makes
a
joke
that
has
something
in
it
i
could
see
it
myself
and
then
for
her
to
die
like
that
it
seems
as
if
it
was
our
fault
it
was
a
beautiful
ball
was
it
dear
i
do
think
it
was
but
it
spoilt
for
me
i
can
only
be
thankful
it
was
her
stomach
or
i
should
have
blamed
the
supper
as
it
is
there
must
have
been
a
draught
it
was
a
cold
night
was
a
lovely
night
henrietta
said
thinking
of
the
terrace
and
the
dark
river
and
the
stars
she
could
remember
it
all
without
shame
for
he
had
not
failed
her
and
her
personality
had
not
failed
he
had
not
deserted
her
and
when
they
met
there
would
be
no
need
for
explanations
he
would
look
at
her
she
would
look
at
him
she
had
to
rouse
herself
it
was
a
splendid
ball
mrs
batty
what
did
you
think
of
my
dress
dear
batty
asked
and
checked
herself
we
ought
not
to
talk
about
such
things
with
your
dear
aunt
just
dead
you
must
miss
her
sadly
did
you
were
you
with
her
at
the
end
but
this
was
a
region
in
which
henrietta
could
not
wander
with
batty
let
us
talk
of
it
she
said
batty
gurgled
a
rich
sympathy
and
after
a
due
pause
she
was
glad
to
resume
the
topic
of
the
dance
this
was
her
first
real
opportunity
for
discussing
it
under
batty
slightly
ironical
smile
and
his
references
to
expense
she
had
controlled
herself
among
her
acquaintances
it
was
necessary
to
treat
the
affair
as
a
mere
bagatelle
but
with
henrietta
she
could
expand
unlimitedly
what
she
thought
what
she
felt
what
she
said
what
other
people
said
to
her
and
what
her
guests
were
reported
to
have
said
to
other
people
was
repeated
and
enlarged
upon
to
henrietta
who
leaning
back
occasionally
nodding
her
head
or
uttering
a
sound
of
encouragement
lived
through
that
night
again
yes
out
on
the
terrace
he
had
been
the
real
francis
sales
and
that
man
in
the
hollow
looking
at
aunt
rose
and
then
turning
to
henrietta
in
uncertainty
was
the
one
evoked
by
that
witch
on
horseback
the
modern
substitute
for
a
broomstick
christabel
sales
was
right
aunt
rose
was
a
witch
with
her
calm
white
face
riding
swiftly
and
fearlessly
on
her
messages
of
evil
he
was
never
himself
in
her
presence
how
could
he
be
he
was
under
her
spell
and
he
must
be
cleared
of
it
and
kept
immune
but
how
through
these
thoughts
which
were
both
exciting
and
alarming
henrietta
heard
batty
uttering
the
name
of
charles
seems
to
have
taken
a
turn
for
the
better
my
dear
he
been
ill
henrietta
asked
no
what
you
might
call
melancholy
not
lately
well
since
the
dance
he
has
been
different
not
so
irritable
at
breakfast
i
told
you
once
before
love
how
i
dreaded
breakfast
with
john
late
half
the
time
going
out
with
the
dogs
and
batty
behind
the
paper
with
his
eyebrows
up
and
charles
looking
as
if
he
been
dug
up
like
lazarus
if
it
is
wrong
to
say
so
pale
and
pasty
and
sorry
he
was
alive
sort
of
damp
dear
well
you
know
what
i
mean
but
as
i
tell
you
he
been
more
cheerful
that
dance
must
have
done
him
good
or
something
has
and
batty
tells
me
he
takes
more
interest
in
his
work
still
batty
admitted
does
catch
me
up
at
times
i
know
about
music
i
know
he
queer
i
hate
it
when
he
gets
angry
and
shouts
but
he
good
really
in
his
heart
of
course
he
is
batty
murmured
and
looking
at
the
plump
hands
on
her
silken
lap
she
added
wish
he
marry
now
john
he
engaged
but
he
did
need
to
be
you
know
what
i
mean
he
was
happy
enough
before
but
charles
if
he
could
marry
a
nice
girl
wo
henrietta
said
at
once
and
batty
suddenly
alert
asked
sharply
not
i
do
know
men
are
so
easily
deceived
ca
help
it
you
would
neglect
a
baby
well
then
it
the
same
thing
they
never
get
out
of
their
short
frocks
even
batty
his
wife
chuckled
very
clever
and
all
that
but
he
like
all
the
rest
the
very
minute
you
marry
you
got
a
baby
on
your
hands
henrietta
sighed
is
fair
she
murmured
yet
she
liked
the
notion
francis
sales
was
a
baby
he
would
have
to
be
managed
to
be
amused
he
would
tire
of
his
toys
she
knew
that
and
she
saw
herself
constantly
dressing
up
the
old
ones
and
deceiving
him
into
believing
they
were
new
suppose
they
worth
it
she
half
questioned
babies
henrietta
answered
meaning
the
same
thing
but
batty
took
her
up
with
fervour
she
was
reminiscent
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
was
prophetic
she
was
embarrassing
and
faintly
disgusting
to
henrietta
and
when
the
door
opened
to
let
in
charles
she
welcomed
him
with
a
pleasure
which
was
really
the
measure
of
her
relief
she
had
not
seen
him
since
she
had
parted
from
him
in
the
car
he
did
not
return
her
smile
and
it
struck
her
that
he
never
smiled
it
was
a
good
thing
it
would
have
made
him
look
odder
than
ever
and
somehow
he
contrived
to
show
his
happiness
without
the
display
of
teeth
his
eyes
she
decided
bulged
most
when
he
was
miserable
and
now
they
hardly
bulged
at
all
back
early
dear
batty
said
have
some
fresh
tea
made
but
charles
without
averting
his
gaze
from
henrietta
said
do
want
any
tea
and
to
henrietta
he
said
quietly
have
seen
you
for
weeks
to
her
annoyance
she
felt
the
colour
creeping
over
her
cheeks
no
doubt
he
would
account
for
that
in
his
own
way
and
to
disconcert
him
she
added
casually
not
long
really
seems
long
he
said
no
one
but
charles
batty
would
have
said
that
in
the
presence
of
his
mother
it
was
ridiculous
and
she
looked
at
him
with
revengeful
criticism
he
was
plain
he
was
getting
bald
his
trousers
bagged
his
socks
were
wrinkled
like
concertinas
his
comparative
was
quite
unjustified
he
had
looked
at
her
consistently
since
he
entered
the
room
and
henrietta
was
angrily
aware
that
batty
was
trying
to
make
herself
insignificant
in
her
corner
of
the
sofa
henrietta
could
hear
the
careful
control
of
her
breathing
she
was
hoping
to
make
the
young
people
forget
she
was
there
henrietta
frowned
warningly
at
charles
the
matter
he
asked
at
once
she
might
have
known
it
was
useless
to
make
signs
you
frowned
do
you
ever
get
a
twinge
she
prevaricated
dear
batty
clucked
her
distress
get
some
laudanum
you
just
rub
it
on
the
gum
she
rose
have
some
in
my
medicine
cupboard
i
go
and
get
it
she
went
out
and
across
her
broad
back
she
seemed
to
carry
the
legend
is
the
consummation
of
tact
charles
stood
up
and
planted
himself
on
the
hearthrug
and
henrietta
wished
batty
had
not
gone
sorry
you
got
toothache
he
said
have
i
did
say
i
had
my
teeth
are
perfect
with
a
vicious
opening
of
her
mouth
she
let
him
see
them
why
did
you
frown
had
to
do
something
to
stop
your
glaring
at
me
i
glaring
i
did
know
i
suppose
i
ca
help
looking
at
you
henrietta
appreciated
this
remark
do
mind
so
much
when
we
are
alone
from
anybody
else
she
would
have
expected
a
reminder
that
she
had
once
allowed
more
than
that
but
she
was
safe
with
charles
and
half
annoyed
by
her
safety
her
instinct
was
to
run
and
dodge
but
it
was
a
poor
game
to
play
at
with
this
roughly
executed
statue
of
a
young
man
mother
must
have
noticed
she
explained
why
not
she
have
to
know
what
she
cried
indignantly
we
engaged
she
brightened
angrily
after
all
he
was
thinking
of
that
night
and
she
felt
a
new
exasperated
respect
for
him
i
told
you
i
told
you
i
did
mean
anything
when
i
let
you
when
we
were
alone
in
that
car
was
thinking
of
that
he
said
and
she
felt
a
drop
he
had
no
business
not
to
think
of
it
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
coldly
been
engaged
to
you
he
said
a
long
time
i
told
you
but
i
been
thinking
that
it
really
does
work
course
it
does
anybody
would
have
known
that
except
you
charles
batty
but
nobody
tells
me
things
i
have
to
find
them
out
he
sighed
takes
time
but
now
i
know
well
you
released
from
the
engagement
you
made
all
by
yourself
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
said
mildly
i
ca
be
released
so
the
only
way
out
of
it
is
for
you
to
be
engaged
too
he
fumbled
in
a
pocket
bought
a
ring
she
sneered
told
you
about
that
remembered
it
john
got
one
it
always
done
and
i
think
this
one
is
pretty
she
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
his
choice
she
guessed
it
would
be
gaudy
like
a
child
but
she
said
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
do
want
to
see
it
look
you
hopeless
man
said
he
would
change
it
if
you
did
like
it
into
her
hand
he
put
the
little
box
attractively
small
no
doubt
lined
with
soft
white
velvet
and
she
longed
to
open
it
she
had
always
wanted
one
of
those
little
boxes
and
she
remembered
how
often
she
had
gazed
at
them
holding
glittering
rings
in
the
windows
of
jewellers
shops
she
looked
up
at
charles
her
eyes
bright
her
lips
a
little
parted
so
young
and
helpless
in
that
moment
that
she
drew
from
him
his
first
cry
of
passion
his
hands
trembled
only
she
faltered
i
like
looking
at
pretty
things
know
he
dropped
to
the
sofa
beside
her
could
be
anything
else
she
turned
to
him
her
face
close
to
his
and
she
asked
plaintively
why
should
it
be
she
seemed
to
blame
him
she
did
blame
him
there
was
something
in
his
presence
seductively
secure
there
was
peace
she
almost
loved
him
she
loved
her
power
to
make
him
tremble
and
if
only
he
could
make
her
tremble
too
she
would
be
his
it
is
anything
else
she
said
below
her
breath
it
is
he
echoed
in
the
loud
voice
of
his
trouble
he
got
up
and
moved
away
just
look
at
the
ring
and
tell
me
if
you
like
it
he
heard
the
box
unwrapped
and
a
voice
saying
do
like
it
keep
it
i
ca
you
can
it
for
you
it
pretty
is
it
and
you
like
pretty
things
could
just
look
at
it
now
and
then
could
i
but
no
it
fair
do
mind
about
that
mean
fair
to
me
he
turned
at
that
do
understand
kind
of
hold
she
explained
could
it
be
i
was
trying
to
tempt
you
but
we
engaged
and
you
must
have
a
ring
she
shook
her
small
clenched
fists
not
we
not
oh
yes
you
can
be
if
you
like
but
i
did
mean
it
would
hold
me
in
that
way
i
meant
it
would
be
like
a
sign
of
you
i
should
be
able
to
forget
you
you
would
be
there
in
the
ring
in
the
box
in
the
drawer
like
the
portrait
of
aunt
sophia
she
stopped
herself
i
ca
burn
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
suppose
i
ought
to
you
ought
she
sprang
up
delivered
from
her
weakness
is
nonsense
of
course
i
ca
keep
your
ring
take
it
back
charles
it
beautiful
i
thought
it
would
be
all
red
and
blue
like
a
flag
but
it
lovely
it
makes
my
mouth
water
it
like
white
fire
like
you
he
said
just
as
bright
and
just
as
hard
and
if
only
you
were
as
small
i
could
put
you
in
my
pocket
and
never
let
you
go
she
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
why
do
you
let
me
go
she
asked
on
an
ascending
note
and
she
did
not
mean
to
taunt
him
it
would
be
so
easy
for
him
to
keep
her
if
he
knew
how
she
expected
a
despairing
groan
she
half
hoped
for
a
violent
embrace
but
he
answered
quietly
do
really
let
you
go
it
you
i
love
not
just
your
hair
and
your
face
and
the
way
your
nose
turns
up
and
your
hands
and
feet
and
your
straight
neck
i
have
to
let
them
go
but
you
do
go
you
stay
with
me
all
the
time
you
always
will
you
like
music
always
in
my
head
but
you
more
than
that
you
go
deeper
i
suppose
into
my
heart
sometimes
i
think
i
carrying
you
in
my
arms
i
ca
see
you
but
i
can
feel
you
there
and
sometimes
i
laugh
because
i
think
you
laughing
she
listened
charmed
into
stillness
here
was
an
echo
of
his
outpouring
in
the
darkness
of
that
hour
by
the
monks
pool
but
these
words
were
closer
dearer
she
felt
for
that
moment
that
he
did
indeed
carry
her
in
his
arms
and
that
she
was
glad
to
be
there
he
spoke
so
quietly
he
was
so
certain
of
his
love
that
she
was
exalted
and
abashed
she
did
not
deserve
all
this
yet
he
knew
she
was
hard
as
well
as
bright
he
knew
her
nose
turned
up
perhaps
there
was
nothing
he
did
not
know
he
went
on
simply
without
effort
though
i
ugly
and
a
fool
i
ca
be
hurt
whatever
you
choose
to
do
what
you
do
is
you
he
touched
himself
you
is
here
so
it
does
matter
about
the
ring
it
does
matter
about
francis
sales
she
said
on
a
caught
breath
and
in
a
whisper
about
him
he
looked
at
her
and
made
a
slight
movement
with
the
hands
hanging
at
his
sides
a
little
flicking
movement
as
though
he
brushed
something
away
think
perhaps
you
are
going
to
marry
him
he
said
deeply
her
head
went
up
told
you
that
she
demanded
nobody
tells
me
anything
nobody
knows
she
said
scornfully
have
seen
him
since
she
hesitated
this
charles
knew
everything
and
he
said
for
her
rather
wearily
very
quietly
his
wife
died
no
but
you
will
she
said
defiantly
expect
i
shall
i
hope
i
shall
a
shudder
passed
through
charles
batty
big
frame
and
the
words
marry
him
reached
her
ears
like
a
distant
muttering
of
a
storm
would
not
be
happy
has
happiness
to
do
with
it
she
asked
with
an
astonishing
young
bitterness
if
you
feel
like
that
he
said
you
feel
as
i
do
about
you
if
nothing
he
does
and
nothing
he
says
says
very
little
henrietta
interrupted
gloomily
but
charles
seemed
not
to
hear
his
actions
are
only
like
the
wind
in
the
trees
fluttering
the
leaves
yes
i
suppose
that
love
the
tree
remains
she
dropped
her
face
into
her
hands
making
me
miserable
she
cried
he
removed
her
hands
and
held
them
firmly
why
do
know
she
swayed
towards
him
but
he
kept
her
arms
rigid
like
a
bar
between
them
i
do
want
to
lose
you
ca
he
assured
her
though
you
think
you
have
me
in
your
heart
the
me
that
change
you
like
the
other
one
too
would
you
i
mean
really
like
to
hold
me
not
just
the
thought
of
me
tell
me
you
love
me
in
that
way
too
he
said
love
you
in
that
way
too
but
i
tell
you
it
matter
he
dropped
her
hands
as
though
he
had
no
more
strength
your
francis
sales
you
still
belong
to
me
will
you
belong
to
me
she
asked
softly
she
could
not
lose
him
she
wanted
to
have
them
both
and
charles
perhaps
unwisely
perhaps
from
the
depth
of
his
wisdom
which
was
truth
answered
quietly
belonged
to
you
since
the
first
day
i
saw
you
she
let
out
a
sigh
of
inexpressible
relief
to
rose
the
time
between
the
death
of
caroline
and
the
coming
of
spring
was
like
an
invalid
convalescence
she
felt
a
languor
as
though
she
had
been
ill
and
a
kind
of
content
as
though
she
were
temporarily
free
from
cares
she
knew
that
henrietta
and
charles
batty
often
met
but
she
did
not
wish
to
know
how
charles
had
succeeded
in
preventing
her
escape
she
did
not
try
to
connect
christabel
illness
with
henrietta
return
she
enjoyed
unquestioningly
her
rich
feeling
of
possession
in
the
presence
of
the
girl
who
was
much
on
her
dignity
very
well
behaved
but
undeniably
aloof
she
had
not
yet
forgiven
her
aunt
for
that
episode
in
the
gipsies
hollow
but
it
did
not
matter
rose
could
tell
herself
without
any
affectation
of
virtue
that
she
had
hoped
for
no
benefit
for
herself
looking
back
she
saw
that
even
what
might
be
called
her
sin
had
been
committed
chiefly
for
francis
sake
only
she
had
not
sinned
enough
but
for
the
present
she
need
not
think
of
him
he
had
gone
away
she
heard
and
she
could
ride
over
the
bridge
without
the
fear
of
meeting
him
and
with
the
feeling
that
the
place
was
more
than
ever
hers
it
was
gloriously
empty
of
any
claim
but
its
own
to
gallop
across
the
fields
to
ride
more
slowly
on
some
height
with
nothing
between
her
and
great
massy
clouds
of
unbelievable
whiteness
to
feel
herself
relieved
of
an
immense
responsibility
was
like
finding
the
new
world
she
had
longed
for
she
wished
sincerely
that
francis
would
not
come
back
she
wished
that
riding
one
day
she
might
find
sales
hall
blotted
out
leaving
no
sign
no
trace
nothing
but
earth
and
fresh
spikes
of
green
day
by
day
she
watched
the
advance
of
spring
the
larches
put
out
their
little
tassels
celandines
opened
their
yellow
eyes
the
smell
of
the
gorse
was
her
youth
wafted
back
to
her
and
she
shook
her
head
and
said
she
did
not
want
it
this
maturity
was
better
she
had
reached
the
age
when
she
could
almost
dissociate
things
from
herself
and
she
found
them
better
and
more
beautiful
she
needed
this
consolation
for
it
seemed
that
her
personal
relationships
were
to
be
few
and
shadowy
conscious
in
herself
of
a
capacity
for
crystallizing
them
enduringly
they
yet
managed
to
evade
her
it
was
some
fault
some
failure
in
herself
but
not
knowing
the
cause
she
could
not
cure
it
and
she
accepted
it
with
the
apparent
impassivity
which
was
perhaps
the
origin
of
the
difficulty
and
capable
as
she
was
of
love
she
was
incapable
of
struggling
for
it
she
wanted
henrietta
affection
she
wanted
to
give
every
happiness
to
that
girl
but
she
could
not
be
different
from
herself
she
could
not
bait
the
trap
and
it
seemed
that
henrietta
might
be
finding
happiness
without
her
help
or
at
least
without
realizing
that
it
was
she
who
had
given
charles
his
chance
she
had
rejected
her
plan
of
taking
henrietta
away
it
was
better
to
leave
her
in
the
neighbourhood
of
charles
for
he
was
not
a
francis
sales
and
if
henrietta
could
once
see
below
his
queer
exterior
she
would
never
see
it
again
except
to
laugh
at
it
with
an
understanding
beyond
the
power
of
irritation
and
she
was
made
to
have
a
home
to
be
busy
about
small
important
things
to
play
with
children
and
tyrannize
over
a
man
in
the
matter
of
socks
and
collars
to
be
tyrannized
over
by
him
in
the
bigger
affairs
of
life
and
with
henrietta
settled
rose
would
at
last
be
free
to
take
that
journey
which
like
everything
else
had
eluded
her
so
far
she
would
be
free
but
for
sophia
who
seemed
in
these
days
pathetically
subdued
and
frail
but
sophia
rose
decided
could
stay
with
henrietta
for
a
time
or
one
of
the
elderly
cousins
would
be
glad
to
take
up
a
temporary
residence
in
nelson
lodge
she
was
excited
by
the
prospect
of
her
freedom
and
sometimes
as
though
she
were
doing
something
wrong
she
secretly
carried
the
big
atlas
to
her
bedroom
and
pored
over
the
maps
there
were
places
with
names
like
poetry
and
she
meant
to
see
them
all
she
moved
already
in
a
world
of
greater
space
and
fresher
air
her
body
was
rejuvenated
her
mind
recovered
from
its
weariness
and
when
on
an
april
day
she
came
across
francis
sales
in
one
of
his
own
fields
it
was
a
sign
of
her
condition
that
her
first
thought
was
of
henrietta
and
not
of
herself
he
had
returned
and
henrietta
was
again
in
danger
though
one
of
another
kind
she
stopped
her
horse
thinking
firmly
whatever
happens
she
shall
not
marry
him
he
is
not
good
enough
she
said
morning
in
that
cool
voice
which
made
him
think
of
churches
and
he
stood
stroking
the
horse
nose
looking
down
and
making
no
reply
been
away
he
said
at
last
know
when
did
you
come
back
night
i
been
to
canada
to
see
her
people
i
thought
like
to
know
about
her
and
she
would
have
liked
it
too
a
small
smile
threatened
rose
mouth
it
seemed
rather
late
to
be
trying
to
please
christabel
did
hope
he
went
on
quietly
have
this
luck
so
soon
been
wanting
to
see
you
to
tell
you
something
i
wanted
to
get
things
cleared
up
things
he
looked
up
henrietta
no
need
for
that
for
you
perhaps
but
there
is
for
me
you
were
quite
right
that
day
i
went
home
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
break
my
word
to
her
made
it
up
before
christabel
became
so
ill
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
could
have
left
her
that
night
perhaps
you
had
realized
meant
to
but
anyhow
i
could
have
left
her
and
i
would
have
done
it
if
i
could
you
were
perfectly
right
rose
moved
a
little
in
her
saddle
yet
i
had
no
right
to
be
she
said
and
i
he
said
quickly
and
i
were
different
i
do
blame
myself
for
that
but
with
henrietta
it
was
just
devilry
sickness
misery
do
he
commanded
to
compare
our
our
love
with
that
she
said
i
do
think
of
it
at
all
it
has
dropped
back
where
it
came
from
and
i
do
know
where
that
is
i
do
think
of
it
any
more
but
thank
you
for
telling
me
about
henrietta
she
moved
on
but
his
voice
followed
her
never
loved
her
she
stopped
but
did
not
turn
know
that
but
i
wanted
to
tell
you
he
was
at
the
horse
head
again
do
think
much
of
the
way
those
people
are
keeping
your
bridle
there
rust
on
the
curb
chain
look
at
it
it
disgraceful
and
like
to
tell
you
that
i
tried
to
make
it
up
to
christabel
at
the
last
too
late
but
she
was
happy
tell
those
people
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
suppose
we
all
ought
to
be
rose
said
wearily
of
us
are
he
replied
he
hesitated
wo
stop
riding
here
now
i
come
back
course
not
it
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
sha
worry
you
she
laughed
frankly
not
afraid
of
that
she
was
immune
she
told
herself
she
could
not
be
touched
yet
she
knew
she
had
been
touched
already
she
was
obliged
to
think
of
him
for
the
first
time
in
her
knowledge
of
him
he
had
not
grumbled
he
was
like
a
repentant
child
and
she
realized
that
he
had
suffered
an
experience
unknown
to
her
a
sense
of
sin
and
the
fact
gave
him
a
certain
superiority
and
interest
in
her
eyes
she
went
home
but
not
as
she
had
set
forth
for
she
seemed
to
hear
the
jingle
of
her
chains
at
luncheon
henrietta
appeared
in
a
new
hat
and
an
amiable
mood
she
was
going
she
said
casually
to
a
concert
with
charles
batty
did
know
there
was
one
rose
said
is
it
not
in
radstowe
we
going
henrietta
said
reluctantly
wellsborough
but
that
name
seemed
to
have
no
association
for
aunt
rose
she
said
yes
they
have
very
good
concerts
there
and
i
hope
charles
will
like
your
hat
do
suppose
he
will
notice
it
henrietta
murmured
she
felt
grateful
for
her
aunt
forgetfulness
and
she
said
with
an
enthusiasm
she
had
not
shown
for
a
long
time
look
lovely
aunt
rose
as
if
something
nice
had
happened
rose
laughed
and
said
henrietta
in
a
manner
faintly
reminiscent
of
caroline
and
she
added
quickly
against
the
invasion
of
her
own
thoughts
as
for
charles
he
notices
much
more
than
one
would
think
i
found
that
out
henrietta
grieved
do
think
people
ought
to
notice
well
that
one
nose
turns
up
depends
how
it
does
it
yours
is
very
satisfactory
they
sparkled
at
each
other
pleased
at
the
ease
of
their
intercourse
and
quite
unaware
that
these
personalities
also
were
reminiscent
of
the
caroline
and
sophia
tradition
of
compliment
sophia
drooping
over
the
table
said
vaguely
very
satisfactory
but
she
hardly
knew
to
what
rose
had
referred
she
lived
in
her
own
memories
but
she
tried
to
disguise
her
distraction
and
it
was
always
safe
to
agree
with
rose
she
had
good
judgment
unfailing
taste
she
said
more
brightly
forgotten
susan
tells
me
that
francis
sales
has
come
home
rose
said
and
after
the
slightest
pause
she
added
saw
him
this
morning
she
did
not
look
at
henrietta
she
felt
with
something
like
despair
that
this
had
occurred
at
the
very
moment
when
they
seemed
to
be
their
friendship
and
now
henrietta
would
be
reminded
of
the
unhappy
past
she
did
not
look
across
the
table
but
to
her
astonishment
she
heard
the
girl
voice
with
trouble
enmity
and
anger
concentrated
in
its
control
saying
quickly
that
the
nice
thing
that
happened
nice
sophia
murmured
francis
he
must
have
been
glad
to
see
you
rose
eyes
glanced
over
henrietta
face
with
a
look
too
proud
to
be
called
disdain
she
was
doubly
shocked
first
by
the
girl
effrontery
and
then
by
the
truth
in
her
words
she
had
indeed
been
feeling
indefinitely
happy
and
ignoring
the
cause
she
was
even
now
not
sure
of
the
cause
she
did
not
know
whether
it
was
the
change
in
francis
or
the
jingling
of
the
chains
still
sounding
in
her
ears
but
there
had
been
a
lightness
in
her
heart
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
sense
of
that
approaching
freedom
on
which
she
had
been
counting
she
turned
to
sophia
as
though
henrietta
had
not
spoken
i
think
he
was
glad
to
see
a
friend
he
has
been
to
canada
to
see
family
no
he
did
say
how
he
was
but
i
thought
he
looked
rather
old
poor
boy
sophia
said
think
rose
dear
it
would
be
kind
to
ask
him
here
he
knows
he
can
come
when
he
likes
rose
said
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
henrietta
was
shaking
delicately
she
could
only
have
got
relief
by
inarticulate
noises
and
insanely
violent
movements
she
hated
francis
sales
she
hated
rose
and
sophia
and
charles
batty
she
would
not
go
to
the
concert
yes
she
would
go
and
make
charles
miserable
she
was
enraged
at
the
folly
of
her
own
remark
at
rose
and
at
her
possible
possession
of
francis
sales
she
could
not
unsay
what
she
had
said
and
having
said
it
she
did
not
know
how
to
go
on
living
with
aunt
rose
but
she
was
going
to
wellsborough
again
and
this
time
she
need
not
come
back
yet
she
must
come
back
to
see
francis
sales
and
though
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
to
whom
she
could
express
the
torment
of
her
mind
she
could
at
least
make
charles
unhappy
rose
and
sophia
were
chatting
pleasantly
and
henrietta
pushed
back
her
chair
you
excuse
me
i
have
to
catch
a
train
rose
inclined
her
head
sophia
said
dear
go
where
did
you
say
you
were
going
wellsborough
yes
caroline
and
i
be
careful
to
get
into
a
ladies
carriage
henrietta
going
with
charles
batty
she
said
dully
then
you
will
be
safe
safe
yes
she
was
perfectly
safe
with
charles
he
would
sit
with
his
hands
hanging
between
his
knees
and
stare
she
was
sick
of
him
and
if
she
dared
she
would
whisper
during
the
music
at
any
rate
she
would
shuffle
her
feet
and
make
a
noise
with
the
programme
and
she
would
emulate
her
aunt
and
waylay
francis
sales
there
would
be
no
harm
in
copying
aunt
rose
a
pattern
of
conduct
she
had
done
it
before
she
would
do
it
again
and
they
would
see
which
one
of
them
was
to
be
victorious
at
the
last
she
fulfilled
her
intentions
charles
who
had
been
flourishing
under
the
kindness
of
her
friendship
was
puzzled
by
her
capriciousness
but
he
did
not
question
her
he
was
learning
to
accept
mysteries
calmly
and
to
work
at
them
in
his
head
she
shuffled
her
feet
and
he
pretended
not
to
hear
she
crackled
her
programme
and
he
smiled
down
at
her
this
was
maddening
yet
it
was
a
tribute
to
her
power
she
could
do
what
she
liked
and
charles
would
love
her
he
was
a
great
possession
she
did
not
know
what
she
would
do
without
him
as
they
ate
their
rich
cakes
in
a
famous
teashop
charles
talked
incessantly
about
the
music
and
when
at
last
he
paused
she
said
indifferently
did
hear
a
note
mildly
he
advised
her
not
to
wear
such
tight
shoes
she
looked
down
at
them
had
them
made
for
me
seemed
to
be
uncomfortable
he
said
was
thinking
thinking
thinking
about
you
would
understand
charles
you
too
good
dare
say
he
murmured
never
wanted
to
murder
anyone
i
have
sales
fellow
her
eyelids
quivered
but
she
said
boldly
of
me
of
course
not
making
noises
at
concerts
shooting
birds
told
you
so
before
been
to
canada
know
he
has
come
back
i
suppose
he
had
to
come
back
some
day
i
hate
aunt
rose
a
pity
charles
said
taking
another
cake
a
pity
woman
yes
everybody
thinks
so
till
they
know
her
know
her
and
i
think
she
adorable
the
word
was
startling
from
his
lips
charles
too
she
exclaimed
inwardly
was
aunt
rose
even
to
come
between
her
and
charles
of
course
he
remembered
his
lesson
the
most
beautiful
and
the
best
woman
in
the
world
not
a
woman
at
all
she
said
angrily
a
fiend
but
you
wo
be
you
feel
different
he
had
she
reflected
a
gift
of
prophecy
i
shall
she
said
softly
stupid
it
will
be
all
right
i
sha
even
be
angry
with
aunt
rose
and
you
been
an
angel
to
me
i
shall
never
forget
you
he
said
nothing
he
seemed
very
much
interested
in
his
cake
and
because
she
foresaw
that
her
anger
towards
aunt
rose
would
soon
be
changed
to
pity
she
apologized
to
her
that
night
afraid
i
was
rude
to
you
at
luncheon
you
oh
not
rude
henrietta
perhaps
rather
foolish
and
indiscreet
you
should
think
before
you
speak
this
admonition
was
not
what
henrietta
expected
and
she
said
just
what
i
was
doing
you
mean
i
ought
to
be
quiet
when
thinking
yes
that
would
be
even
better
aunt
rose
i
should
never
speak
at
all
when
i
with
you
have
talked
to
me
for
a
long
time
she
made
a
gesture
like
her
father
impatient
hopeless
can
i
she
demanded
there
was
too
much
between
them
the
figure
of
francis
sales
was
too
solid
she
set
out
as
she
had
intended
the
next
afternoon
it
was
full
now
and
radstowe
was
gay
and
sweet
with
flowering
trees
the
delicate
rose
of
the
almond
blossom
had
already
faded
to
a
fainting
pink
and
fallen
to
the
ground
and
the
laburnum
was
weeping
golden
tears
which
would
soon
drop
to
the
pavements
and
blacken
there
the
red
and
white
hawthorns
were
all
out
and
henrietta
daily
walks
had
been
punctuated
by
ecstatic
halts
when
she
stood
under
a
canopy
of
flower
and
leaf
and
drenched
herself
in
scent
and
colour
or
peeped
over
garden
fences
to
see
tall
tulips
springing
up
out
of
the
grass
but
she
did
not
linger
it
seemed
a
long
time
since
she
had
crossed
the
river
yet
the
only
change
was
in
the
new
green
of
the
trees
splashing
the
side
of
the
gorge
the
gulls
were
still
quarrelling
for
food
on
the
muddy
banks
children
and
perambulators
horses
and
carts
were
passing
over
the
bridge
as
on
her
first
day
in
radstowe
but
there
was
now
no
francis
sales
on
his
fine
horse
the
sun
was
bright
but
clouds
were
being
blown
by
a
wind
with
a
sharp
breath
and
she
went
quickly
lest
it
should
rain
before
her
business
was
accomplished
she
had
no
fear
of
not
finding
francis
sales
in
such
things
her
luck
never
failed
her
and
she
came
upon
him
even
sooner
than
she
had
expected
in
the
outermost
of
his
fields
he
stood
beside
the
gate
scrutinizing
a
flock
of
sheep
and
lambs
and
talking
to
the
shepherd
and
he
turned
at
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
on
the
road
she
smiled
sweetly
rather
stiffly
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
hat
and
in
that
moment
she
recognized
that
he
had
no
welcome
for
her
he
had
changed
he
was
grave
though
he
was
not
sullen
and
she
said
to
herself
with
her
ready
bitterness
he
has
reformed
now
that
there
no
need
that
what
they
all
do
but
her
smile
did
not
fade
she
leaned
over
the
gate
in
a
friendly
manner
and
asked
him
about
the
lambs
how
old
were
they
she
hoped
he
would
not
have
them
killed
they
were
too
sweet
she
had
never
touched
one
in
her
life
why
did
they
get
so
ugly
afterwards
it
was
hard
to
believe
those
little
things
with
faces
like
kittens
or
like
flowers
were
the
children
of
their
lumpy
mothers
you
think
i
could
catch
one
if
i
came
inside
she
asked
inside
he
said
the
shepherd
shall
catch
one
for
you
she
stroked
the
curly
wool
she
pulled
the
apprehensive
ears
she
uttered
absurdities
and
glancing
up
to
see
if
sales
were
laughing
at
her
charming
folly
she
saw
that
he
was
examining
his
flock
with
the
practical
interest
of
a
farmer
he
was
apparently
considering
some
technical
point
he
had
not
been
listening
to
her
at
all
she
hated
that
lamb
she
hoped
he
would
kill
it
and
all
the
rest
and
she
decided
to
eat
mutton
in
future
with
voracity
was
going
to
pick
primroses
she
said
there
any
in
these
fields
do
know
can
you
spare
me
a
few
minutes
i
want
to
speak
to
you
her
heart
which
had
been
thumping
with
a
sickening
slowness
quickened
its
beats
perhaps
she
had
been
mistaken
perhaps
his
serious
manner
was
that
of
a
great
occasion
and
she
saw
herself
returning
to
nelson
lodge
and
treating
her
aunt
rose
with
gentle
tact
we
sit
on
the
gate
she
asked
rather
walk
across
the
field
i
been
wanting
to
see
you
since
that
night
i
owe
you
an
apology
she
dared
not
speak
for
fear
of
making
a
mistake
and
she
waited
walking
slowly
beside
him
her
eyes
downcast
apology
for
the
whole
thing
he
said
she
looked
up
whole
thing
way
i
behaved
with
you
that
i
do
see
why
you
should
apologize
she
said
was
fair
it
was
even
decent
it
was
a
sort
of
habit
with
you
was
it
she
said
commiseratingly
and
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
his
face
flush
quite
understand
and
we
were
both
amused
was
amused
he
said
a
bit
and
i
sorry
i
behaved
as
i
did
you
were
so
young
and
so
pretty
well
it
no
good
making
excuses
but
i
could
rest
until
i
seen
you
and
humbled
myself
aunt
rose
tell
you
to
say
this
she
asked
of
course
not
why
should
she
seems
to
have
an
extraordinary
power
she
has
he
said
simply
have
you
humbled
yourself
to
her
too
with
her
he
said
slowly
was
no
need
see
she
laughed
up
at
him
frankly
know
i
never
took
it
very
seriously
i
sorry
the
thought
of
it
has
troubled
you
he
went
on
ignoring
her
lightness
and
determined
to
say
everything
meant
to
meet
you
that
night
and
tell
you
what
i
telling
you
now
but
christabel
was
very
ill
and
i
could
leave
her
i
hope
this
was
difficult
hope
you
did
get
into
any
sort
of
mess
night
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
back
to
it
night
no
i
went
to
a
concert
with
charles
batty
he
was
bewildered
it
was
all
right
of
course
did
know
he
muttered
you
forgive
me
she
was
generous
was
just
as
bad
as
you
the
malletts
are
all
flirts
have
you
heard
aunt
caroline
say
so
we
ca
help
doing
silly
things
but
we
never
take
them
seriously
why
you
must
have
noticed
that
with
aunt
rose
he
said
with
dignity
aunt
rose
is
like
nobody
else
in
the
world
i
think
i
told
you
that
once
she
he
hesitated
and
was
silent
i
must
be
going
back
henrietta
said
easily
sha
bother
about
the
primroses
i
think
it
going
to
rain
and
you
wo
think
about
this
any
more
will
you
you
know
aunt
caroline
says
she
nearly
eloped
several
times
and
i
know
my
father
did
it
once
with
my
own
mother
probably
with
other
people
beside
it
in
the
blood
i
must
try
to
settle
down
we
did
behave
rather
badly
i
suppose
but
so
much
has
happened
since
that
was
my
first
ball
and
i
felt
i
wanted
to
do
something
daring
were
not
to
blame
he
said
i
nearly
old
enough
to
be
your
father
i
ca
forgive
myself
i
ca
forget
it
dear
and
i
never
took
it
seriously
at
all
there
was
a
train
back
to
radstowe
at
ten
i
looked
it
up
i
was
going
to
get
that
but
as
it
happened
i
went
to
a
concert
with
charles
batty
you
seem
to
have
no
idea
how
to
play
a
game
you
have
to
pretend
to
yourself
it
a
matter
of
life
and
death
but
you
have
to
let
it
be
that
would
spoil
it
see
he
said
afraid
i
did
look
at
it
like
that
i
wish
i
had
and
i
glad
you
did
it
makes
it
easier
and
harder
for
me
ought
she
said
have
laid
the
rules
down
first
yes
we
ought
to
have
done
that
she
laughed
again
shall
do
that
another
time
you
been
awfully
good
to
me
henrietta
thank
you
a
bit
she
cried
i
known
you
were
bothering
about
it
i
would
have
reassured
you
she
could
not
withhold
a
parting
shot
would
have
sent
you
a
message
by
aunt
rose
she
waved
a
hand
and
ran
back
to
the
road
she
did
not
trouble
to
ask
herself
whether
or
not
he
believed
her
she
was
shaken
by
sobs
without
tears
she
did
not
love
him
she
had
never
loved
him
but
she
could
not
bear
the
knowledge
that
he
did
not
love
her
it
was
quite
plain
she
was
not
going
to
deceive
herself
any
more
his
manner
had
been
unmistakable
and
it
was
aunt
rose
he
loved
she
had
been
beaten
by
aunt
rose
and
even
charles
called
her
adorable
she
did
not
want
francis
sales
he
was
rather
stupid
and
as
a
legitimate
lover
he
would
be
dull
duller
than
charles
who
at
least
knew
how
to
say
things
but
something
coloured
and
exciting
and
dramatic
had
been
ravished
from
her
by
aunt
rose
that
was
the
sting
and
she
was
humiliated
though
she
would
not
own
it
she
had
been
good
enough
for
an
episode
but
her
charm
had
not
endured
her
little
rather
inhuman
teeth
ground
against
each
other
but
she
had
been
clever
she
had
carried
it
off
well
she
had
not
given
a
sign
and
she
determined
to
be
equally
clever
with
aunt
rose
some
day
she
would
refer
lightly
to
her
folly
and
laugh
at
the
susceptibility
of
francis
sales
it
would
hurt
aunt
rose
to
have
her
faithful
lover
disparaged
but
ah
if
only
she
and
aunt
rose
were
friends
what
a
conspiracy
they
could
enjoy
together
they
had
both
suffered
they
might
both
laugh
how
they
might
play
into
each
other
hands
with
francis
sales
for
the
bewildered
ball
it
would
be
the
finest
sport
in
the
world
but
they
were
not
friends
and
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
aunt
rose
at
that
game
no
she
was
alone
in
the
world
and
as
she
felt
the
first
drop
of
rain
on
her
face
she
became
aware
of
the
aching
of
her
heart
she
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
bridge
a
grey
mist
was
being
driven
up
the
river
blotting
out
the
gorge
and
the
trees
a
gull
shrieking
dismally
cleaved
the
greyness
with
a
white
flash
it
was
cold
and
henrietta
shivered
and
once
again
she
wished
she
could
sit
by
a
fireside
with
some
one
who
was
kind
and
tender
but
there
would
only
be
aunt
sophia
and
aunt
rose
sitting
with
her
in
that
where
everything
was
too
elegant
and
too
clear
where
now
no
one
ever
laughed
they
sat
by
the
fire
as
she
had
foreseen
sophia
pretending
to
be
busy
with
her
embroidery
rose
in
a
chair
reading
a
book
henrietta
sat
on
a
low
stool
with
a
book
open
on
her
knee
but
she
did
not
read
it
the
fire
talked
to
itself
said
silly
things
and
chuckled
or
murmured
sentimentally
that
chatter
vaguely
insane
and
the
turning
of
rose
pages
the
drawing
of
sophia
silks
through
the
stuff
and
the
click
of
her
scissors
were
the
only
sounds
until
suddenly
sophia
gave
a
groan
and
fell
back
in
her
chair
rose
very
much
startled
glanced
at
henrietta
and
jumped
up
her
heart
henrietta
said
with
the
superiority
of
her
knowledge
get
her
medicine
she
came
back
with
it
was
like
this
when
aunt
caroline
died
but
i
promised
not
to
tell
if
she
has
this
she
will
be
better
it
was
henrietta
who
poured
the
liquid
into
the
glass
and
applied
it
to
sophia
lips
she
was
she
felt
the
practical
person
and
it
was
she
and
not
aunt
rose
who
had
been
trusted
by
aunt
sophia
told
me
where
she
kept
the
stuff
henrietta
continued
calmly
that
better
sophia
recovered
with
apologies
a
little
faintness
it
was
nothing
in
a
few
minutes
she
would
go
to
bed
they
helped
her
there
ought
to
have
told
me
henrietta
rose
said
on
the
landing
could
she
wished
it
to
be
our
secret
it
was
pleasant
to
feel
that
aunt
rose
was
out
of
this
affair
must
have
the
doctor
and
she
ought
not
to
be
alone
i
sleep
on
the
sofa
in
her
room
henrietta
you
need
more
sleep
than
i
do
but
i
young
enough
to
sleep
anywhere
on
the
floor
but
let
aunt
sophia
choose
henrietta
went
back
to
the
and
the
housemaid
was
sent
for
the
doctor
shortly
afterwards
there
came
a
ring
at
the
bell
no
doubt
it
was
the
doctor
and
henrietta
wished
she
could
go
upstairs
with
him
for
aunt
rose
she
told
herself
again
was
not
a
practical
person
and
henrietta
was
experienced
in
illness
she
had
nursed
her
mother
and
she
liked
looking
after
people
she
knew
how
to
arrange
pillows
she
was
not
afraid
of
sickness
however
she
would
have
to
wait
until
aunt
sophia
sent
for
her
but
it
was
not
the
doctor
it
was
charles
batty
who
appeared
in
the
doorway
henrietta
said
have
you
come
for
he
put
down
the
hat
and
stick
he
had
forgotten
to
leave
in
the
hall
do
know
he
said
had
a
kind
of
feeling
you
might
like
to
see
me
it
the
first
time
i
had
it
he
added
solemnly
he
really
had
an
extraordinary
way
of
knowing
things
but
she
said
aunt
sophia
ill
so
i
do
think
you
can
stay
he
looked
round
for
her
not
here
i
sha
do
any
harm
shall
i
we
can
whisper
would
hear
us
anyhow
it
my
room
above
this
one
it
he
gazed
at
the
ceiling
with
interest
up
there
should
have
thought
you
knew
by
instinct
she
said
bitingly
and
sit
down
charles
and
do
be
disagreeable
i
shall
have
to
go
to
aunt
sophia
soon
but
then
you
will
be
able
to
talk
to
aunt
rose
that
will
do
just
as
well
quite
he
said
really
came
to
tell
you
said
you
came
because
you
thought
i
wanted
you
i
did
but
there
were
several
reasons
you
said
you
were
going
to
be
happy
not
murderous
do
you
remember
and
i
thought
like
to
see
how
you
looked
you
do
look
happy
a
bit
what
the
matter
told
you
aunt
sophia
and
would
you
be
happy
if
you
had
to
sit
in
this
prim
room
with
two
old
women
but
your
aunt
caroline
is
dead
my
aunt
rose
is
very
much
alive
he
wagged
his
head
see
she
is
lively
she
sits
like
this
reading
a
book
and
aunt
sophia
poor
aunt
sophia
sews
like
this
and
i
sit
on
this
horrid
little
stool
like
this
that
how
we
spend
the
evening
would
you
like
to
spend
it
i
do
know
she
dropped
her
black
head
to
her
knees
so
lonely
he
began
again
really
came
to
tell
you
that
there
a
house
to
let
on
the
green
that
little
one
with
the
red
roof
like
a
cap
and
windows
that
squint
a
little
old
house
but
he
paused
has
every
modern
convenience
henrietta
there
a
curl
at
the
back
of
your
neck
know
it
always
there
ca
go
on
about
the
house
unless
you
sit
up
of
that
curl
i
not
interested
in
the
house
she
did
not
move
is
it
belongs
to
a
client
of
ours
but
that
does
matter
the
point
is
that
it
to
let
i
got
an
order
to
view
look
admit
charles
i
went
this
evening
and
we
can
both
go
it
really
a
very
cosy
little
house
there
a
opening
on
the
garden
at
the
back
with
plenty
of
room
for
a
grand
piano
and
the
i
liked
the
very
much
there
was
a
fire
in
it
that
unusual
looked
so
cosy
with
a
red
carpet
and
everything

carpet
to
let
too
do
know
i
dare
say
we
could
buy
it
and
mind
you
henrietta
the
kitchen
is
on
the
ground
floor
that
unusual
if
you
like
in
an
old
house
i
made
sure
of
that
before
i
went
any
further
far
are
you
going
go
everywhere
even
into
the
coal
cellar
i
just
peeped
can
imagine
you
but
what
do

a
house

the
evenings

them
in
the
little
house

said
firmly

adore
a
little
house
of
my
own
i
believe
that
just
what
i
want
that
settled
not
with
you
charles
he
said
nothing
for
a
time
she
was
sitting
up
her
hands
clasped
on
her
lap
and
as
she
looked
at
him
she
half
regretted
her
last
words
this
was
how
they
would
sit
in
the
little
house
by
the
fire
surrounded
by
their
own
possessions
with
everything
clean
and
bright
and
as
he
had
said
very
cosy
she
had
never
had
a
home
suddenly
she
leaned
towards
him
and
put
her
head
on
his
knee
his
hand
fell
on
her
hair
does
mean
anything
she
murmured
i
was
just
thinking
you
tempting
me
again
first
with
the
ring
because
it
was
so
pretty
and
now
with
a
house
else
am
i
to
get
you
he
cried
out
you
know
you
were
feeling
lonely
that
why
i
came
thought
it
was
your
chance
he
said
do
know
the
ordinary
things
but
i
know
the
others
wonder
how
she
said
and
he
answered
with
the
one
word
in
a
voice
so
deep
and
solemn
that
she
laughed
you
know
she
said
have
never
had
a
home
i
lived
in
other
people
houses
with
their
ugly
furniture
their
horrid
sticky
curtains
shall
take
that
house
you
ca
go
on
collecting
things
like
this
houses
and
rings
ring
in
my
pocket
now
must
stay
there
charles
i
ought
not
to
keep
my
head
on
your
knee
but
it
comfortable
and
i
have
no
conscience
none
she
sat
up
brushing
his
chin
with
her
hair
she
said
emphatically
here
aunt
rose
coming
to
fetch
me
for
aunt
sophia
mind
promised
nothing
besides
you
have
asked
me
to
promise
anything
he
blinked
there
no
time
now
good

mallett
he
pulled
himself
out
of
his
chair
evening

be
with
her
rose
smiling
but
a
little
pitiful
said
gently
gave
her
the
choice
and
she
chose
me
she
disappeared
and
henrietta
turned
to
charles
see
she
gets
everything
she
gets
everything
i
ever
wanted
and
she
does
try
her
hands
dropped
to
her
side
just
gets

she
turned
away
it
does
matter
she
going
to
marry
francis
sales
makes
you
ask
that
she
cried
do
know
i
just
thought
of
it
your
thoughts
why
you
suggested
the
same
thing
for
me
as
if
i
would
look
at
him
charles
blinked
his
sign
of
agitation
but
henrietta
did
not
see
good
to
look
at
charles
muttered
knows
how
to
wear
his
clothes
does
matter
charles
heaved
a
sigh
never
knows
what
matters
the
malletts
do
marry
henrietta
said
caroline
and
aunt
sophia
and
aunt
rose
and
now
me
there
something
in
us
that
ca
be
satisfied
it
was
the
same
with
my
father
only
it
took
him
the
other
way
did
know
he
was
married
more
than
once
nobody
tells
me
things
dear
you
very
stupid
he
was
only
married
once
in
a
church
i
see
if
i
did
marry
i
should
be
like
him
she
turned
to
him
and
put
her
face
close
to
his
she
pronounced
clearly
well
henrietta
you
would
still
be
you
she
stepped
backwards
shocked
would
you
mind
so
much
he
said
stolidly
doing
without
you
altogether
the
other
day
you
said
you
need
never
do
that
because
she
tapped
his
waistcoat
i
here
he
showed
a
face
she
had
never
seen
before
seem
to
think
i
not
made
of
flesh
and
blood
he
cried
wanton
henrietta
simply
wanton
and
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
she
heard
the
front
door
bang
she
saw
his
hat
and
stick
lying
where
he
had
put
them
she
smiled
at
them
politely
and
then
sinking
to
the
floor
beside
the
fender
she
let
out
a
little
moan
of
despair
and
delight
the
fire
chuckled
and
chattered
and
she
leaned
forward
her
face
near
the
bars
talking
for
a
minute
i
want
to
tell
you
something
nobody
else
to
tell
listen
i
in
love
with
him
now
she
nodded
her
head
with
him
i
know
it
ridiculous
but
it
true
did
you
hear
you
can
laugh
if
you
like
i
do
care
i
in
love
with
him
oh
dear
she
circled
her
neck
with
her
hands
as
though
she
must
clasp
something
and
it
would
have
been
too
silly
to
fondle
his
ugly
hat
and
he
would
remember
he
had
forgotten
it
he
would
come
back
she
dared
not
see
him
love
him
she
cried
out
much
to
want
to
see
him
she
paused
astonished
suppose
that
how
he
feels
about
me
how
wonderful
she
looked
round
at
the
furniture
so
still
and
unmoved
by
the
happy
bewilderment
in
which
she
found
herself
the
piano
was
mute
the
lamps
burned
steadily
the
chair
in
which
charles
had
sat
was
unconscious
of
its
privilege
even
the
fire
flames
had
subsided
and
she
was
intensely
madly
joyously
alive
too
much
she
said
much
and
for
the
first
time
she
was
ashamed
of
her
episode
with
francis
sales
at
love
she
whispered
but
charles
would
be
coming
back
and
tiptoeing
as
though
he
might
hear
her
from
the
street
she
picked
up
his
hat
and
stick
and
laid
them
neatly
on
the
step
outside
the
front
door
she
slept
with
the
profundity
of
her
happiness
and
descended
to
breakfast
in
a
dream
only
the
sight
of
rose
tired
face
reminded
her
that
aunt
sophia
was
she
had
had
a
bad
night
but
she
was
better
not
going
to
die
too
is
she
henrietta
asked
and
she
had
a
sad
vision
of
aunt
rose
living
all
alone
in
nelson
lodge
may
live
for
a
long
time
but
the
doctor
says
she
may
die
at
any
moment
do
suppose
she
wants
to
live
makes
you
think
that
of
aunt
caroline
and
other
people
but
if
she
dies
whatever
will
you
do
the
question
amused
rose
and
see
the
world
at
last
she
said
you
will
come
too
henrietta
laughed
and
flushed
and
became
serious
must
die
for
after
all
aunt
sophia
was
not
a
true
mallett
according
to
aunt
caroline
test
she
believed
in
marriage
she
would
like
to
see
henrietta
in
the
little
house
one
of
them
would
be
able
to
call
on
the
other
every
day
it
was
wonderful
of
charles
to
have
known
she
would
like
that
house
she
knew
it
well
with
its
red
cap
and
its
squinting
eyes
but
then
he
was
altogether
wonderful
she
supposed
he
would
call
for
her
that
afternoon
and
they
would
present
the
order
to
view
together
but
he
did
not
come
with
her
hat
and
gloves
lying
ready
on
the
bed
she
waited
for
his
knock
in
vain
he
must
have
been
kept
by
business
he
would
come
later
to
explain
and
then
when
still
he
did
not
come
she
decided
that
he
must
be
ill
if
so
her
place
was
by
his
side
and
she
saw
herself
moving
like
an
angel
about
his
bed
and
yet
the
thought
of
charles
in
bed
was
comic
at
dinner
she
ate
nothing
and
when
rose
remarked
on
this
henrietta
murmured
that
she
had
a
headache
she
thought
she
would
go
for
a
walk
if
you
are
really
going
out
will
you
take
a
note
to
batty
she
sent
some
fruit
and
flowers
to
sophia
i
suppose
charles
told
her
she
was
henrietta
looked
sharply
at
her
aunt
she
was
suspicious
of
what
seemed
like
tact
but
rose
wore
an
ordinary
expression
the
note
ready
henrietta
asked
i
meant
to
post
it
but
i
rather
she
had
it
and
there
is
the
basket
to
return
well
i
take
them
both
and
if
i
a
little
late
you
know
i
have
just
gone
for
a
walk
or
something
sha
worry
about
you
rose
said
henrietta
walked
up
the
yellow
drive
trembling
a
little
she
had
decided
to
ask
for
batty
who
was
always
pleased
to
see
her
but
when
the
door
was
opened
her
ears
were
assailed
by
a
blast
of
triumphant
sound
it
was
charles
playing
the
piano
he
was
not
ill
he
was
not
busy
he
was
merely
playing
the
piano
as
though
there
were
no
henrietta
in
the
world
and
her
trembling
changed
to
the
stiffness
of
great
anger
she
handed
in
the
basket
and
the
note
without
a
word
or
a
smile
for
the
friendly
parlourmaid
she
walked
home
in
the
awful
realization
that
she
had
worn
charles
out
he
had
called
her
wanton
he
must
have
meant
it
it
was
that
word
which
had
really
made
her
love
him
yet
it
was
also
the
sign
of
his
exhaustion
life
was
tragic
no
it
was
comic
it
was
playful
she
had
had
happiness
in
her
hands
and
it
had
slipped
through
them
she
felt
sick
with
disappointment
under
her
rage
but
she
was
not
without
hope
it
stirred
in
her
gently
charles
would
come
back
but
would
he
and
she
suddenly
felt
a
terrible
distrust
of
that
love
of
which
he
had
boasted
it
was
too
complete
he
could
do
without
her
he
would
go
on
loving
but
she
repeated
it
she
had
worn
him
out
and
she
could
not
love
like
that
she
wanted
tangible
things
but
he
had
said
that
he
too
was
flesh
and
blood
and
that
comforted
her
he
would
come
back
but
she
could
do
nothing
to
invite
him
this
she
said
firmly
was
the
real
thing
it
had
been
different
with
francis
sales
with
him
there
had
been
no
necessity
for
pride
but
her
love
for
charles
must
be
wrapped
round
with
reserve
and
kept
holy
and
at
once
with
her
unfailing
dramatic
sense
she
saw
herself
moving
quietly
through
life
tending
the
sacred
flame
and
then
irritably
she
told
herself
she
could
not
spend
her
days
doing
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
she
hated
him
she
would
go
away
yes
she
would
go
away
with
aunt
rose
in
the
meantime
she
wept
with
a
passion
of
disappointment
humiliation
and
pain
but
on
each
successive
morning
for
some
weeks
she
woke
to
hope
for
here
was
a
new
day
with
many
possibilities
in
its
hours
and
each
evening
she
dropped
on
to
her
bed
disheartened
nothing
happened
aunt
sophia
was
better
rose
rode
out
every
day
the
little
house
on
the
green
stood
empty
squinting
disconsolately
resignedly
surprised
at
its
own
loneliness
it
was
strange
that
nobody
wanted
a
house
like
that
it
was
neglected
and
so
was
she
nobody
noticed
the
one
or
the
other
every
morning
henrietta
took
aunt
sophia
for
a
stately
walk
every
afternoon
she
went
to
a
or
for
the
summer
festivities
were
beginning
once
more
and
often
as
she
returned
she
would
meet
aunt
rose
coming
back
from
her
ride
always
cool
in
her
linen
coat
however
hot
the
day
where
did
she
go
how
often
did
she
meet
francis
sales
why
should
she
be
enjoying
adventures
while
henrietta
at
the
only
age
worth
having
was
desperately
fulfilling
the
tedious
round
of
her
engagements
it
was
absurd
and
aunt
rose
would
ask
serenely
you
have
a
good
game
henrietta
as
though
there
was
nothing
wrong
henrietta
did
not
care
for
games
it
was
the
big
sport
of
life
itself
she
craved
for
and
she
could
not
get
it
all
these
young
men
handsome
and
healthy
in
their
flannels
and
ready
to
be
pleasant
she
found
dull
while
the
figure
of
the
charles
his
vague
gestures
his
unseeing
eyes
screening
the
activity
of
his
brain
became
heroic
in
their
difference
she
never
saw
him
she
did
not
visit
batty
she
was
afraid
of
falling
tearfully
on
that
homely
sympathetic
breast
but
batty
as
usual
issued
invitations
for
a
shall
have
to
go
sophia
sighed
an
old
and
so
kind
a
friend
but
without
caroline
for
the
first
tune
is
no
need
for
you
to
go
rose
said
at
once
batty
will
understand
and
henrietta
and
i
will
represent
the
family
i
must
not
give
way
caroline
never
gave
way
there
was
no
excitement
in
dressing
for
this
party
without
caroline
things
lost
their
zest
and
they
set
out
demurely
walking
very
slowly
for
sophia
sake
it
was
a
hot
day
and
batty
standing
at
the
garden
door
to
greet
her
guests
was
obliged
to
wipe
her
face
surreptitiously
now
and
then
while
the
statues
in
the
hall
with
their
burdens
of
ferns
and
lamps
showed
their
cool
limbs
beneath
their
scanty
but
still
decent
drapery
batty
took
sophia
to
a
seat
under
a
tree
and
henrietta
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
blazing
sunlight
alone
where
was
aunt
rose
henrietta
looked
round
and
had
a
glimpse
of
that
slim
black
form
moving
among
the
with
francis
sales
he
had
simply
carried
her
off
it
was
disgraceful
and
things
seemed
to
repeat
themselves
for
ever
aunt
rose
with
her
look
of
having
lost
everything
still
succeeded
in
possessing
while
henrietta
was
alone
she
had
no
place
in
the
world
john
affianced
bride
was
busy
among
the
guests
like
a
daughter
of
the
house
a
slobbering
bulldog
at
her
heels
and
henrietta
isolated
on
the
lawn
was
overcome
by
her
own
forlornness
it
had
been
very
different
at
the
ball
and
how
queer
life
was
it
was
just
a
succession
of
days
that
was
all
little
things
happened
and
the
days
went
on
big
things
happened
and
seemed
to
change
the
world
but
nothing
was
really
changed
and
a
whole
life
could
be
spent
with
a
moment
happiness
or
despair
for
its
only
marks
henrietta
rather
impressed
by
the
depths
of
her
own
thoughts
moved
through
the
garden
where
was
charles
she
wanted
to
see
him
and
get
their
meeting
over
but
there
was
not
a
sign
of
him
and
avoiding
the
croquet
players
and
that
shady
corner
where
elderly
ladies
were
clustered
near
the
band
the
same
band
which
had
played
at
the
ball
henrietta
found
herself
in
the
kitchen
garden
she
examined
the
gooseberry
bushes
and
strawberry
beds
with
apparent
interest
unwilling
to
join
the
guests
and
still
more
unwilling
to
be
found
alone
in
this
deserted
state
it
was
very
hot
the
open
door
of
a
little
shed
showed
her
a
dim
and
cool
interior
she
peeped
in
and
stepped
back
with
an
exclamation
something
had
moved
in
there
it
might
be
a
rat
or
one
of
john
ferocious
terriers
but
a
voice
said
quietly
only
me
she
stepped
forward
are
you
doing
in
there
cool
charles
said
thought
nobody
would
find
me
you
come
in
it
rather
dirty
in
here
but
it
cool
and
you
hear
the
band
i
been
sitting
on
the
handle
of
the
wheelbarrow
so
that
clean
anyhow
i
wipe
it
with
my
handkerchief
to
make
sure
where
are
you
going
to
sit
i
do
know
room
on
the
other
handle
henrietta
sat
with
her
knees
between
the
shafts
and
he
sat
on
the
other
handle
with
his
back
to
her
ca
stay
here
long
she
said
charles
agreed
the
place
smelt
musty
but
of
heaven
it
was
draped
with
cobwebs
like
celestial
clouds
it
was
dark
but
gradually
the
forms
of
rakes
hoes
spades
and
a
cleared
themselves
from
the
gloom
and
charles
head
bloomed
above
his
coat
like
a
great
pale
flower
she
put
out
her
hand
and
drew
it
back
again
she
found
nothing
to
say
outside
the
sun
poured
down
its
rays
like
fire
henrietta
head
drooped
under
her
big
hat
she
was
content
to
stay
here
for
ever
if
charles
would
stay
too
her
body
felt
as
though
it
were
imponderable
she
had
no
feet
she
could
not
feel
the
hard
handle
of
the
wheelbarrow
she
seemed
to
be
floating
blissfully
aware
of
nothing
but
that
floating
yet
a
threat
of
laughter
began
to
tickle
her
it
was
absurd
to
sit
like
this
like
strangers
in
an
omnibus
the
laughter
rose
to
her
throat
and
escaped
she
floated
no
longer
but
she
was
no
less
happy
the
matter
asked
the
voice
of
charles
funny
sitting
like
this
else
can
we
do
could
turn
round
not
room
for
all
our
knees
she
stood
up
with
a
little
rustle
and
walked
to
the
door
too
hot
out
there
she
said
and
returned
to
face
him
she
said
in
rather
a
high
voice
you
find
your
hat
and
stick
that
night
oh
yes
and
then
irrelevantly
he
added
just
been
made
a
partner
she
was
always
interested
in
practical
things
batty
firm
how
splendid
i
did
know
you
were
any
good
at
business
been
improving
and
you
do
know
anything
about
me
do
charles
she
said
earnestly
nothing
you
have
time
to
think
of
anybody
but
yourself
and
now
i
must
go
and
look
after
all
these
people
you
better
come
and
have
an
ice
there
was
ice
at
her
heart
and
she
realized
now
that
her
past
unhappiness
had
been
half
false
she
had
been
waiting
for
him
all
the
time
and
trusting
to
his
next
sight
of
her
to
put
things
right
but
she
had
failed
with
him
too
in
that
dim
she
had
stood
before
him
in
her
pretty
dress
smiling
down
at
him
surely
irresistible
and
he
had
resisted
well
she
could
resist
too
and
she
walked
calmly
by
his
side
holding
her
head
very
high
and
when
he
parted
from
her
with
a
grave
bow
she
felt
a
great
an
awed
respect
for
him
she
went
to
find
her
aunt
sophia
who
was
still
sitting
under
the
tree
surrounded
by
a
chattering
group
she
looked
tired
and
signalling
for
henrietta
to
approach
she
said
afraid
this
is
too
much
for
me
dear
child
can
you
find
rose
and
ask
her
to
take
me
home
but
i
do
want
to
spoil
your
pleasure
henrietta
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
come
henrietta
lip
twisted
with
dramatic
bitterness
there
was
no
pleasure
left
for
her
would
rather
go
back
with
you
aunt
sophia
let
us
go
now
no
find
rose
there
was
another
buffet
in
the
face
it
was
rose
who
was
wanted
and
henrietta
walking
swiftly
crossed
the
lawn
again
casting
quick
glances
right
and
left
rose
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
perhaps
for
their
ways
had
an
odd
habit
of
following
the
same
path
she
was
in
the
with
francis
sales
but
as
she
turned
to
go
there
the
voice
of
batty
husky
with
exhaustion
and
heat
said
in
her
ear
it
your
aunt
rose
you
are
looking
for
love
i
think
i
saw
her
go
into
the
house
and
i
wish
i
could
go
myself
it
so
hot
that
i
really
feel
i
may
have
a
fit
henrietta
went
into
the
cool
shaded
on
light
feet
and
there
against
the
window
she
saw
her
aunt
rose
in
an
attitude
startlingly
unfamiliar
she
was
standing
with
her
hands
clasped
before
her
and
she
gazed
down
at
them
lost
in
thought
or
prayer
her
body
so
upright
and
strong
seemed
limp
and
broken
and
her
face
which
was
calm
yet
had
the
look
of
having
composed
itself
after
pain
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
but
henrietta
had
the
strong
impression
that
someone
had
lately
passed
through
the
door
she
was
afraid
to
disturb
that
moment
in
which
an
escaped
soul
seemed
to
be
fluttering
back
into
its
place
but
rose
looked
up
and
saw
her
and
henrietta
advancing
softly
as
though
towards
a
person
who
was
dead
stopped
within
a
foot
of
her
then
without
thought
and
obeying
an
uncontrollable
impulse
she
stepped
forward
and
laid
her
cheek
against
her
aunt
rose
hands
dropped
apart
and
one
arm
encircling
henrietta
waist
she
held
her
close
but
only
for
a
minute
it
was
henrietta
who
broke
away
saying
sophia
sent
me
to
look
for
you
she
does
feel
well
batty
was
cured
of
giving
parties
it
was
after
her
ball
that
miss
caroline
died
and
it
was
after
her
that
miss
sophia
finally
collapsed
the
heat
the
emotion
of
her
memories
and
the
effort
of
disguising
it
had
been
too
much
for
her
she
died
the
following
day
and
batty
felt
that
the
largest
and
most
expensive
wreath
procurable
could
not
approach
the
expression
of
her
grief
it
was
no
good
talking
to
batty
about
it
he
would
only
say
he
had
been
against
the
ball
and
from
the
first
but
batty
found
charles
unexpectedly
soothing
he
was
certainly
much
improved
of
late
and
when
she
heard
that
he
was
to
go
to
nelson
lodge
on
business
connected
with
the
estate
she
burdened
him
with
a
number
of
incoherent
messages
for
rose
perhaps
he
delivered
them
he
certainly
stayed
in
the
for
some
time
and
henrietta
sitting
sorrowfully
in
her
bedroom
could
hear
his
voice
on
monotonously
then
there
was
a
laugh
and
henrietta
was
indignant
nobody
ought
to
laugh
with
aunt
sophia
lying
dead
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
stay
in
her
room
while
those
two
aunt
rose
and
her
charles
talked
and
laughed
together
she
thought
of
pretending
not
to
know
he
was
there
and
of
entering
the
in
a
careless
manner
but
she
could
not
allow
aunt
rose
to
witness
charles
indifference
all
she
could
do
was
to
steal
on
to
the
landing
and
lean
over
the
banisters
to
watch
him
depart
she
had
the
painful
consolation
of
seeing
the
top
of
his
head
and
of
hearing
him
say
day
after
rose
answered
it
most
important
henrietta
waited
until
the
front
door
had
closed
behind
him
and
then
seeing
rose
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
said
important
aunt
rose
are
you
there
henrietta
what
a
pity
you
did
come
down
that
was
charles
batty
know
what
important
is
a
lot
of
complicated
business
to
get
through
might
let
me
help
wish
you
would
when
charles
comes
again
his
father
is
very
well
you
had
better
be
present
not
with
charles
henrietta
said
firmly
he
understand
wills
and
things
i
think
he
very
clever
and
quite
interesting
henrietta
said
glad
he
coming
again
and
now
henrietta
she
sighed
must
get
ready
for
the
cousins
the
female
relatives
returned
in
dingy
cabs
they
had
not
yet
laid
aside
their
black
and
beads
for
caroline
and
as
though
they
thought
sophia
had
been
unfairly
cheated
of
new
mourning
they
had
adorned
themselves
with
a
fresh
black
ribbon
here
and
there
or
a
larger
brooch
of
jet
and
these
additions
gave
to
the
older
garments
a
rusty
look
a
sort
of
blush
across
these
heaps
of
woe
and
dye
the
glances
of
rose
and
henrietta
met
in
an
understanding
pleasing
to
both
this
mourning
had
a
professional
almost
a
rapacious
quality
and
if
these
women
had
no
hope
of
material
pickings
they
were
getting
all
possible
nourishment
from
emotional
ones
their
eyes
very
sharp
but
veiled
by
seemly
gloom
criticized
the
slim
upright
figures
of
these
young
women
who
could
wear
black
gracefully
sorrow
with
dignity
and
who
had
as
they
insisted
so
much
the
look
of
sisters
the
air
seemed
freer
for
their
departure
but
the
house
was
very
empty
and
though
sophia
had
never
made
much
noise
the
place
was
heavy
with
a
final
silence
do
know
why
we
here
henrietta
cried
passionately
across
the
when
susan
had
left
the
ladies
to
their
dessert
were
we
ever
here
rose
asked
one
could
answer
that
question
they
faced
each
other
in
their
old
places
the
curved
ends
of
the
shining
table
were
vacant
the
chippendale
armchairs
were
pushed
back
against
the
wall
yet
the
ghosts
of
caroline
and
sophia
gaily
dressed
with
dangling
earrings
the
sparkle
of
jewels
the
movements
of
their
beringed
fingers
seemed
to
be
in
the
room
we
shall
never
forget
them
henrietta
said
were
persons
aunt
rose
do
you
think
you
and
i
will
go
on
as
they
did
until
just
one
of
us
is
left
could
never
be
like
them
they
were
happy
will
be
happy
again
henrietta
we
shall
get
used
to
this
silence
i
do
think
either
of
us
is
meant
to
be
happy
no
we
not
like
them
we
tragic
but
all
the
same
we
might
get
really
fond
of
one
another
might
we
am
fond
of
you
do
see
how
you
can
be
henrietta
looked
down
at
the
fruit
on
her
plate
what
has
happened
she
almost
whispered
rose
made
no
answer
the
steady
pale
flames
of
the
candles
stood
up
like
golden
fingers
the
shadows
behind
the
table
seemed
to
listen
how
fond
are
you
henrietta
asked
in
a
loud
voice
and
rose
peeling
her
apple
delicately
said
vaguely
do
know
how
you
measure
what
you
would
do
for
a
person
well
i
think
i
have
stood
that
test
henrietta
leaned
over
the
table
and
a
candle
flame
as
though
startled
by
her
gesture
gave
a
leap
and
the
shadows
behind
were
stirred
henrietta
said
hated
you
for
a
long
time
but
now
i
do
you
been
unhappy
too
and
you
were
right
about
that
man
i
love
him
how
could
i
how
could
i
how
could
anybody
if
you
come
that
day
rose
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
and
then
said
wearily
have
made
any
difference
i
never
made
any
difference
you
did
love
him
but
he
never
loved
you
either
child
you
were
quite
safe
henrietta
face
flushed
hotly
this
might
be
true
but
it
was
not
for
aunt
rose
to
say
it
once
more
she
leaned
across
the
table
and
said
clearly
you
still
jealous
rose
smiled
it
seemed
impossible
to
move
her
henrietta
i
left
jealousy
behind
years
ago
we
wo
discuss
this
any
further
it
does
bear
discussion
it
beyond
it
know
it
very
unpleasant
henrietta
said
politely
if
we
are
to
go
on
living
together
we
ought
to
clear
things
up
are
not
going
on
living
together
rose
said
she
left
the
table
and
stood
before
the
fire
one
hand
on
the
mantelshelf
and
one
foot
on
the
fender
the
long
soft
lines
of
her
dark
dress
were
merged
into
the
shadows
and
the
white
arm
the
white
face
and
neck
seemed
to
be
disembodied
henrietta
struck
dumb
by
that
announcement
and
feeling
the
situation
wrested
from
the
control
of
her
young
hands
stared
at
the
slight
figure
which
had
typified
beauty
for
her
since
she
first
saw
it
you
do
like
me
she
faltered
rose
did
not
move
but
she
began
to
speak
i
have
loved
you
very
dearly
almost
as
if
you
were
my
daughter
but
you
seem
to
want
my
love
i
could
force
it
on
you
but
it
has
been
here
it
is
still
here
i
think
you
have
the
power
of
making
people
love
you
yet
you
do
nothing
for
it
except
perhaps
exist
one
ought
not
to
ask
any
more
i
do
ask
it
but
you
ought
to
learn
to
give
you
find
it
the
only
thing
worth
doing
taking
taking
one
becomes
atrophied
no
it
is
that
i
do
care
for
you
it
that
i
am
going
to
be
married
very
carefully
henrietta
put
her
plate
aside
and
supporting
her
face
in
her
hands
she
pressed
her
elbows
into
the
table
she
pressed
hard
until
they
hurt
so
aunt
rose
was
going
to
be
married
while
henrietta
was
deserved
to
francis
sales
she
whispered
to
francis
sales
she
had
a
wild
moment
of
anger
succeeded
by
horror
for
aunt
rose
was
she
stupid
was
she
insensible
and
henrietta
said
you
ca
aunt
rose
you
ca
her
distress
and
a
kind
of
envy
gave
her
courage
is
good
enough
he
played
with
you
and
then
with
me
and
you
said
there
was
some
one
else
the
figure
by
the
mantelpiece
was
so
still
that
henrietta
became
convinced
of
the
potency
of
her
own
words
and
she
went
on
know
everything
about
him
and
you
marry
him
how
can
you
marry
him
a
sound
like
the
faint
and
distant
wailing
of
the
wind
came
out
of
the
shadows
into
which
rose
had
retreated
how
you
going
to
leave
me
for
him
for
him
rose
you
would
be
happier
with
me
again
there
came
that
faint
sound
try
to
be
kinder
to
you
i
do
understand
you
you
do
understand
me
do
you
understand
yourself
she
left
her
place
and
put
her
hands
on
henrietta
shoulders
no
more
she
said
with
unmistakable
authority
no
more
neither
to
me
nor
to
anybody
else
this
is
beyond
you
and
now
come
into
the
do
cry
henrietta
i
not
going
to
be
married
for
some
time
wish
i
known
you
loved
me
henrietta
sobbed
tried
to
show
you
i
known
everything
might
have
been
different
rose
laughed
we
do
want
it
to
be
different
wo
be
happy
henrietta
wailed
at
least
rose
said
sternly
done
nothing
to
make
me
so
henrietta
stilled
her
sobbing
it
was
quite
true
she
had
taken
everything
aunt
rose
money
aunt
rose
love
her
wonderful
forbearance
and
the
love
of
charles
do
know
what
to
do
she
cried
into
the
and
we
talk
about
it
but
they
did
not
talk
rose
played
the
piano
in
the
candlelight
for
a
little
while
before
she
slipped
out
of
the
room
henrietta
sat
on
the
little
stool
without
even
the
fire
to
keep
her
company
she
was
too
dazed
to
think
she
did
not
understand
why
aunt
rose
should
choose
to
marry
francis
sales
and
she
gave
it
up
but
loneliness
stretched
before
her
like
a
long
hard
road
if
only
charles
would
come
he
always
came
when
he
was
wanted
a
memory
reached
her
weary
mind
this
was
day
after
and
aunt
rose
expected
him
she
leapt
up
and
examined
herself
in
the
mirror
she
was
one
of
those
lucky
people
who
can
cry
and
leave
no
trace
colour
had
sprung
into
her
cheeks
but
it
faded
quickly
she
had
waited
for
him
before
and
he
had
not
come
and
she
was
tired
of
waiting
she
sank
into
aunt
caroline
chair
and
shut
her
eyes
she
almost
slept
she
was
on
the
verge
of
dreams
when
the
bell
jangled
harshly
she
did
not
move
she
sat
in
an
agony
of
fear
that
this
would
not
be
charles
but
the
door
opened
and
he
entered
susan
pronounced
his
name
and
he
stood
on
the
threshold
thinking
the
room
was
empty
a
very
small
voice
pierced
the
stillness
i
here
wo
come
a
step
farther
charles
said
severely
you
tell
me
if
you
love
me
thought
you
come
to
see
aunt
rose
i
love
you
i
love
you
she
said
hurriedly
nodding
my
head
hard
no
stay
where
you
are
stay
where
you
are
i
been
loving
you
for
weeks
and
you
treated
me
shamefully
no
no
got
to
be
different
i
got
to
give
you
did
treat
me
shamefully
he
said
stolidly
did
here
the
ring
and
i
took
that
house
i
been
renting
it
ever
since
i
knew
we
were
going
to
live
in
it
here
the
ring
he
dropped
it
into
her
lap
she
looked
down
at
the
stones
hard
and
bright
like
herself
rose
will
be
very
much
surprised
she
said
and
she
was
too
happy
to
wonder
why
he
laughed
standing
on
the
stair
rose
heard
that
laughter
and
went
on
very
slowly
to
her
room
she
had
at
least
done
something
for
henrietta
she
had
given
charles
his
chance
and
now
she
was
to
go
on
doing
things
for
francis
sales
she
owed
him
something
she
owed
him
the
romance
of
her
youth
she
owed
him
the
care
which
was
all
she
had
left
to
give
him
things
had
come
to
her
too
late
her
eyes
were
too
wide
open
yet
perhaps
it
was
better
so
she
had
no
illusions
and
she
wanted
to
justify
her
early
faith
and
christabel
sufferings
and
her
own
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
besides
he
needed
her
and
with
him
she
would
not
be
more
unhappy
he
would
be
happier
he
said
she
had
to
protect
him
against
himself
yet
even
there
she
was
frustrated
for
he
had
in
a
measure
found
himself
and
now
that
she
was
ready
and
able
to
serve
him
there
would
be
less
for
her
to
do
but
she
had
no
choice
there
was
the
old
debt
there
were
the
old
chains
and
as
she
faced
the
future
she
was
stirred
by
hope
she
could
tell
herself
that
something
of
her
dead
love
had
waked
to
life
yet
when
she
tried
to
get
back
the
old
rapture
she
knew
it
had
gone
for
ever
she
entered
her
room
and
did
not
turn
on
the
light
there
seemed
to
be
a
strange
weight
in
her
body
pressing
her
down
but
as
she
looked
through
her
open
window
at
the
summer
sky
deepening
to
night
and
letting
out
the
stars
which
seemed
to
be
much
amused
there
was
a
lightness
in
her
mind
and
smiling
back
at
them
she
was
able
to
share
their
appreciation
of
the
joke
