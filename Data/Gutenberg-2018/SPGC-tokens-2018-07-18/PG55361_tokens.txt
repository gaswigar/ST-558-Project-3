prologue
duthie
walked
up
the
hill
with
the
gurgle
of
the
burn
he
had
just
crossed
purring
in
his
ears
the
road
was
narrow
and
muddy
and
the
house
of
ardguys
for
which
he
was
making
stood
a
little
way
in
front
of
him
looking
across
the
dip
threaded
by
the
water
the
tall
white
walls
discoloured
by
damp
and
crowned
by
their
steep
roof
glimmered
through
the
on
the
bank
at
his
right
hand
there
was
something
distasteful
to
the
reverend
man
decent
mind
in
this
homely
approach
to
the
mansion
inhabited
by
the
lady
he
was
on
his
way
to
visit
and
he
found
the
remoteness
of
this
byway
among
the
grazing
lands
of
angus
oppressive
the
kilpie
burn
travelling
to
the
river
isla
farther
west
had
pushed
its
way
through
the
undulations
of
pasture
that
gave
this
particular
tract
lying
north
of
the
sidlaws
a
definite
character
and
the
formation
of
the
land
seemed
to
suggest
that
some
vast
had
taken
place
in
the
earth
to
be
arrested
suddenly
in
its
heaving
for
all
time
thus
it
was
that
a
stranger
wandering
about
might
come
unwarily
upon
little
outlying
farms
and
cottages
hidden
in
the
trough
of
these
terrestrial
waves
and
find
himself
when
he
least
awaited
it
with
his
feet
on
a
level
with
some
humble
roof
snug
in
a
fold
of
the
braes
it
was
in
one
of
the
largest
of
these
miniature
valleys
that
the
house
of
ardguys
stood
with
the
kilpie
burn
running
at
the
bottom
of
its
sloping
garden
duthie
was
not
a
stranger
but
he
did
not
admire
the
unexpected
he
disliked
the
approach
to
ardguys
for
his
sense
of
suitability
was
great
indeed
it
was
its
greatness
which
was
driving
him
on
his
present
errand
he
had
no
gifts
except
the
quality
of
decency
which
is
a
gift
like
any
other
and
he
was
apt
in
the
company
of
madam
flemington
to
whose
presence
he
was
now
hastening
to
be
made
aware
of
the
great
inconvenience
of
his
shortcomings
and
the
still
greater
inconvenience
of
his
advantage
he
crossed
the
piece
of
uneven
turf
dividing
the
house
from
the
road
and
ascended
the
short
flight
of
stone
steps
a
spare
black
figure
in
a
hat
to
knock
with
no
uncertain
hand
upon
the
door
his
one
great
quality
was
staying
him
up
like
the
rest
of
his
compeers
in
the
first
half
of
the
seventeen
hundreds
duthie
wore
garments
of
rusty
blue
or
grey
during
the
week
but
for
this
occasion
he
had
plunged
his
ungainly
arms
and
legs
into
the
black
which
he
generally
kept
for
the
though
the
change
gave
him
little
distinction
he
was
a
homely
and
very
uncultured
person
and
while
the
approaching
middle
of
the
century
was
bringing
a
marked
improvement
to
country
ministers
as
a
class
mentally
and
socially
he
had
stood
still
he
was
ushered
into
a
small
panelled
room
in
which
he
waited
alone
for
a
few
minutes
his
hat
on
his
knee
then
there
was
a
movement
outside
and
a
lady
came
in
whose
appearance
let
loose
upon
him
all
those
devils
of
apprehension
which
had
hovered
about
him
as
he
made
his
way
from
his
manse
to
the
chair
on
which
he
sat
he
rose
stricken
yet
resolute
with
the
cold
forlorn
courage
which
is
the
bravest
thing
in
the
world
as
madam
flemington
entered
she
took
possession
of
the
room
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
and
the
minister
felt
as
if
he
had
no
right
to
exist
her
eyes
meeting
his
reflected
the
idea
christian
flemington
carried
with
her
that
atmosphere
which
enwraps
a
woman
who
has
been
much
courted
by
men
and
though
she
was
just
over
and
a
grandmother
the
most
inexperienced
observer
might
know
how
strongly
the
fires
of
life
were
burning
in
her
still
an
experienced
one
would
be
led
to
think
of
all
kinds
of
disturbing
subjects
by
her
mere
presence
intrigue
love
power
a
thousand
abstract
yet
stirring
things
far
far
remote
from
the
house
which
was
the
incongruous
shell
of
this
compelling
personality
dignity
was
hers
in
an
almost
appalling
degree
but
it
was
a
quality
unlike
the
vulgar
conception
of
it
a
dignity
which
could
be
all
things
besides
distant
unscrupulous
in
its
uses
at
times
rather
brutal
outspoken
even
jovial
born
of
absolute
fearlessness
and
conveying
the
certainty
that
its
possessor
would
speak
and
act
as
she
chose
because
she
regarded
encroachment
as
impossible
and
had
the
power
of
cutting
the
bridge
between
herself
and
humanity
at
will
that
power
was
hers
to
use
and
to
abuse
and
she
was
accustomed
to
do
both
in
speech
she
could
have
a
plain
coarseness
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
vulgarity
and
is
indeed
scarcely
compatible
with
it
a
coarseness
which
is
disappearing
from
the
world
in
company
with
many
better
and
worse
things
she
moved
slowly
for
she
was
a
large
woman
and
had
never
been
an
active
one
but
the
bold
and
steady
brilliance
of
her
eyes
which
the
years
had
not
faded
suggested
swift
and
sudden
action
in
a
way
that
was
disconcerting
she
had
the
short
straight
nose
common
to
feline
types
and
time
which
had
spared
her
eyes
was
duplicating
her
chin
her
eyebrows
even
and
black
accentuated
the
heavy
silver
of
her
abundant
unpowdered
hair
which
had
turned
colour
early
and
an
immense
ruby
hung
from
each
of
her
tiny
ears
in
a
setting
of
small
diamonds
duthie
who
noticed
none
of
these
things
particularly
was
nevertheless
crushed
by
their
general
combination
it
was
nine
years
before
this
story
opens
that
christian
flemington
had
left
france
to
take
up
her
abode
on
the
small
estate
of
ardguys
which
had
been
left
to
her
by
a
distant
relation
whilst
still
almost
a
child
she
had
married
a
man
much
older
than
herself
and
her
whole
wedded
life
had
been
spent
at
the
court
of
james
ii
of
england
at
germain
whither
her
husband
a
scottish
gentleman
of
good
birth
in
the
exiled
king
suite
had
followed
his
master
remaining
after
his
death
in
attendance
upon
his
widow
mary
beatrice
of
modena
flemington
did
not
long
survive
the
king
he
left
his
wife
with
one
son
who
on
reaching
manhood
estranged
himself
from
his
mother
by
an
undesirable
marriage
indeed
it
was
immediately
after
this
latter
event
that
christian
quitted
her
post
at
court
retiring
to
rouen
where
she
lived
until
the
possession
of
ardguys
which
she
inherited
a
few
months
later
gave
her
a
home
of
her
own
different
stories
were
afloat
concerning
her
departure
many
people
said
that
she
had
gambled
away
the
greater
part
of
her
small
fortune
and
was
forced
to
retrench
in
some
quiet
place
others
that
she
had
quarrelled
with
and
been
dismissed
by
mary
beatrice
others
again
declared
that
she
had
been
paid
too
much
attention
by
the
young
chevalier
de
george
and
had
found
it
discreet
to
take
herself
out
of
his
way
but
the
believers
in
this
last
theory
were
laughed
to
scorn
not
because
the
world
saw
anything
strange
in
the
alleged
infatuation
but
because
it
was
quite
sure
that
christian
flemington
would
have
acted
very
differently
in
the
circumstances
but
no
one
could
be
certain
of
the
truth
the
one
certain
thing
was
that
she
was
gone
and
that
since
her
retreat
to
rouen
she
had
openly
professed
whig
sympathies
she
had
been
settled
at
ardguys
where
she
kept
her
political
leanings
strictly
to
herself
for
some
little
time
when
news
came
that
smallpox
had
carried
off
her
son
and
his
undesirable
wife
and
as
a
consequence
their
little
boy
was
sent
home
to
the
care
of
his
whig
grandmother
much
against
the
will
of
those
jacobites
at
the
court
of
germain
who
were
still
interested
in
the
family
but
as
nobody
objection
was
strong
enough
to
affect
his
pocket
the
child
departed
flemington
as
she
was
called
by
her
few
neighbours
was
in
correspondence
with
none
of
her
old
friends
and
none
of
these
had
the
least
idea
what
she
felt
about
her
loss
or
about
the
prospect
of
the
child
arrival
she
was
his
natural
guardian
and
though
so
many
shook
their
heads
at
the
notion
of
his
being
brought
up
by
a
rank
whig
no
one
was
prepared
to
relieve
her
of
her
responsibility
only
mary
beatrice
mindful
of
the
elder
flemington
faithful
services
to
james
granted
a
small
pension
for
the
boy
upbringing
from
her
meagre
private
purse
but
as
this
was
refused
by
christian
the
matter
ended
and
now
in
the
year
of
grace
young
archie
flemington
was
a
boy
of
eight
and
the
living
cause
of
the
rev
william
present
predicament
madam
flemington
and
the
minister
sat
opposite
to
each
other
silent
he
was
evidently
trying
to
make
a
beginning
of
his
business
but
his
companion
was
not
in
a
mood
to
help
him
he
was
a
person
who
wearied
her
and
she
hated
red
hair
besides
which
she
was
an
episcopalian
and
out
of
sympathy
with
himself
and
his
community
she
found
him
common
and
limited
and
at
the
present
moment
intrusive
it
sma
pleasure
i
have
in
coming
to
ardguys
the
day
he
began
and
then
stopped
because
her
eyes
paralyzed
his
tongue
you
are
no
flatterer
said
she
but
the
contempt
in
her
voice
braced
him
indeed
that
i
am
not
madam
he
replied
neither
shall
it
be
said
of
me
that
i
gang
back
from
my
duty
nane
shall
assail
nor
make
a
mock
of
the
kirk
while
i
am
its
minister
who
has
made
a
mock
of
the
kirk
my
good
man
airchie
the
vision
of
her
grandson
going
forth
like
a
young
david
to
war
against
the
presbyterian
stronghold
brought
back
madam
flemington
ye
may
smile
madam
said
duthie
plunged
deeper
into
the
vernacular
by
agitation
ay
ye
may
lauch
but
it
ill
beseems
the
grey
hair
on
yer
pow
irony
always
pleased
her
and
she
laughed
outright
showing
her
strong
white
teeth
it
was
not
only
archie
and
the
kirk
that
amused
her
but
the
whimsical
turn
of
her
own
fate
which
had
made
her
hear
such
an
argument
from
a
man
it
was
not
thus
that
men
had
approached
her
in
the
old
days
you
are
no
flatterer
duthie
as
i
said
before
he
looked
at
her
with
uncomprehending
eyes
a
shout
as
of
a
boy
playing
outside
came
through
the
window
and
a
bunch
of
cattle
upon
the
slope
cantered
by
with
their
tails
in
the
air
evidently
somebody
was
chasing
them
let
me
hear
about
archie
said
the
lady
recalled
to
the
main
point
by
the
sight
madam
i
would
wish
that
ye
could
step
west
to
the
manse
wi
me
and
see
the
evil
abomination
at
my
gate
it
would
gar
ye
blush
i
am
obliged
to
you
sir
i
had
not
thought
to
be
put
to
that
necessity
by
one
of
your
cloth
madam
go
on
duthie
i
can
blush
without
going
to
the
manse
for
it
an
evil
image
has
been
set
up
upon
my
gate
he
continued
raising
his
voice
as
though
to
cry
down
her
levity
an
idolatrous
picture
i
think
shame
that
the
weans
ganging
by
to
the
schule
should
see
it
but
i
rejoice
that
there
mony
o
them
doesna
ken
wha
it
is
fie
duthie
is
it
venus
it
has
idolatrous
garments
continued
he
with
the
loud
monotony
of
one
shouting
against
a
tempest
and
a
muckle
crown
on
its
head
then
it
is
not
venus
observed
she
venus
goes
stripped
it
is
the
pope
of
rome
went
on
duthie
i
kent
him
when
i
saw
the
gaudy
claes
o
him
and
the
heathen
vanities
on
his
pow
i
kent
it
was
himsel
and
it
was
written
at
the
foot
o
him
forbye
that
ay
madam
there
was
writing
too
there
was
a
muckle
bag
out
frae
his
wi
wicked
words
on
it
awa
to
babylon
wi
me
mr
duthie
i
gar
the
beadle
run
for
water
and
a
clout
for
i
could
not
thole
that
sic
a
thing
should
be
seen
and
you
left
the
pope
said
madam
flemington
i
did
replied
the
minister
i
would
wish
to
let
ye
see
to
whatlike
misuse
airchie
has
put
his
talents
and
how
do
you
know
it
was
archie
work
there
naebody
hereabouts
but
airchie
could
have
made
sic
a
thing
the
beadle
me
that
he
saw
him
sitting
ahint
the
whins
wi
his
box
of
paint
as
he
gae
down
the
manse
road
and
syne
when
he
came
back
the
image
was
there
as
he
finished
his
sentence
the
door
opened
and
a
small
figure
was
arrested
on
the
threshold
by
the
sight
of
him
the
little
boy
paused
disconcerted
and
staring
and
a
faint
colour
rose
in
his
olive
face
then
his
glum
look
changed
to
a
smile
in
which
roguery
misgiving
and
an
intense
malicious
joy
were
blended
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
archie
come
in
and
make
your
reverence
to
duthie
said
madam
flemington
who
had
all
at
once
relapsed
into
punctiliousness
archie
obeyed
his
skin
and
his
dark
eyes
hinted
at
his
french
blood
but
his
bow
made
it
a
certainty
the
minister
offered
no
acknowledgment
if
archie
had
any
doubt
about
the
reason
of
duthie
visit
it
did
not
last
long
the
minister
was
not
a
very
stern
man
in
daily
life
but
now
the
pope
and
madam
flemington
between
them
had
goaded
him
off
his
normal
peaceable
path
and
his
expression
bade
the
little
boy
prepare
for
the
inevitable
archie
reflected
that
his
grandmother
was
a
disciplinarian
and
his
mind
went
to
a
cupboard
in
the
attics
where
she
kept
a
cane
but
the
strain
of
childish
philosophy
which
ran
through
his
volatile
nature
was
of
a
practical
kind
and
it
reminded
him
that
he
must
pay
for
his
pleasures
and
that
sometimes
they
were
worth
the
expense
even
in
the
grip
of
nemesis
he
was
not
altogether
sorry
that
he
had
drawn
that
picture
madam
flemington
said
nothing
and
duthie
beckoned
to
him
to
come
nearer
child
said
he
you
have
put
an
affront
upon
the
whole
o
the
folk
of
this
parish
you
have
raised
up
an
image
to
be
a
scandal
to
the
you
have
set
up
a
notorious
thing
in
our
midst
and
you
have
caused
words
to
issue
from
its
mouth
that
the
very
when
he
dichted
it
out
wi
his
clout
thought
shame
to
look
upon
i
have
jaloused
it
right
to
complain
to
your
grandmother
and
to
warn
her
that
she
may
check
you
before
you
bring
disgrace
and
dismay
upon
her
and
upon
her
house
archie
eyes
had
grown
rounder
as
he
listened
for
the
pomp
of
the
words
impressed
him
with
a
sense
of
importance
and
he
was
rather
astonished
to
find
that
any
deed
of
his
own
could
produce
such
an
effect
he
contemplated
the
minister
with
a
curious
detachment
that
belonged
to
himself
then
he
turned
to
look
at
his
grandmother
and
though
her
face
betrayed
no
encouragement
the
subtle
smile
he
had
worn
when
he
stood
at
the
door
appeared
for
a
moment
upon
his
lips
duthie
saw
it
madam
flemington
had
not
urged
one
word
in
defence
of
the
culprit
but
rightly
or
wrongly
he
scented
lack
of
sympathy
with
his
errand
he
turned
upon
her
i
charge
you
nay
i
demand
it
of
you
he
exclaimed
that
you
root
out
the
evil
in
yon
bairn
nature
tak
awa
from
him
the
foolish
toy
that
he
has
put
to
sic
a
vile
use
i
will
require
of
you
sir
said
madam
flemington
rising
i
have
need
of
nobody
to
teach
me
how
to
correct
my
grandson
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
your
visit
but
i
will
not
detain
you
longer
and
almost
before
he
realized
what
had
happened
duthie
found
himself
once
more
upon
the
stone
steps
of
ardguys
archie
and
his
grandmother
were
left
together
in
the
panelled
room
perhaps
the
boy
hopes
were
raised
by
the
abrupt
departure
of
his
accuser
he
glanced
tentatively
at
her
you
will
not
take
away
my
box
he
inquired
no
duthie
has
a
face
like
this
he
said
airily
drawing
his
small
features
into
a
really
brilliant
imitation
of
the
minister
the
answer
was
hardly
what
he
expected
go
up
to
the
cupboard
and
fetch
me
the
cane
said
madam
flemington
it
was
a
short
time
later
when
archie
rather
sore
but
still
comforted
by
his
philosophy
sat
among
the
boughs
of
a
tree
farther
up
the
hill
it
was
a
favourite
spot
of
his
for
he
could
look
down
through
the
light
foliage
over
the
roof
of
ardguys
and
the
kilpie
burn
to
the
rough
road
ascending
beyond
them
the
figure
of
the
retreating
duthie
had
almost
reached
the
top
and
was
about
to
be
lost
in
the
across
the
strath
the
little
boy
eyes
followed
him
between
the
yellowing
leaves
of
the
tree
which
autumn
was
turning
into
the
ghost
of
itself
he
had
not
escaped
justice
and
the
marks
of
tears
were
on
his
face
but
they
were
not
rancorous
tears
whose
traces
live
in
the
heart
long
after
the
outward
sign
of
their
fall
has
gone
they
were
tears
forced
from
him
by
passing
stress
and
their
sources
were
shallow
madam
flemington
could
deal
out
punishment
thoroughly
but
she
was
not
one
of
those
who
burn
its
raw
wounds
with
sour
words
and
her
grandson
had
not
that
woeful
sense
of
estrangement
which
is
the
lot
of
many
children
when
disciplined
by
those
they
love
archie
adored
his
grandmother
and
the
gap
of
years
between
them
was
bridged
for
him
by
his
instinctive
and
deep
admiration
she
was
no
companion
to
him
but
she
was
a
deity
and
he
had
never
dreamed
of
investing
her
with
those
dull
attributes
which
the
young
will
tack
on
to
those
who
are
much
their
seniors
whether
they
possess
them
or
not
duthie
who
had
just
reached
middle
life
seemed
a
much
older
person
to
archie
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
the
dilapidated
box
which
held
his
chief
treasures
those
dirty
lumps
of
paint
with
which
he
could
do
such
surprising
things
no
there
was
not
very
much
black
left
and
he
must
contrive
to
get
some
more
for
the
adornment
of
the
other
manse
gatepost
was
in
his
mind
he
would
need
a
great
deal
of
black
because
this
time
his
subject
would
be
the
devil
and
there
should
be
the
same
or
very
nearly
the
same
invitation
to
the
minister
chapter
ii
jetsam
eighteen
years
after
the
last
vestige
of
archie
handiwork
had
vanished
under
the
beadle
two
gentlemen
were
sitting
in
the
library
of
a
square
stone
mansion
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
county
of
angus
it
was
evening
and
they
had
drawn
their
chairs
up
to
a
fireplace
in
which
the
flames
danced
between
great
hobs
of
polished
brass
shooting
the
light
from
their
thrusting
tongues
into
a
lofty
room
with
drawn
curtains
and
shelves
of
books
though
the
shutters
were
closed
the
two
men
could
hear
in
the
pauses
of
talk
a
continuous
distant
roaring
which
was
the
sound
of
surf
breaking
upon
the
bar
outside
the
harbour
of
montrose
three
miles
away
a
small
mahogany
table
with
glasses
and
a
decanter
stood
at
lord
balnillo
elbow
and
he
looked
across
at
his
brother
james
whose
life
as
a
soldier
had
kept
him
much
in
foreign
countries
until
the
previous
year
with
an
expression
of
mingled
and
patronage
david
logie
was
one
of
the
many
scottish
gentlemen
of
good
birth
who
had
made
the
law
his
profession
and
he
had
just
retired
from
the
edinburgh
bench
on
which
as
lord
balnillo
he
had
sat
for
hard
upon
a
quarter
of
a
century
his
face
was
and
healthy
and
though
he
had
not
put
on
so
much
flesh
as
a
man
of
sedentary
ways
who
has
reached
the
age
of
might
expect
to
carry
his
main
reason
for
retiring
had
been
the
long
journeys
on
horseback
over
frightful
roads
which
a
judge
duties
forced
him
to
take
another
reason
was
his
estate
of
balnillo
which
was
far
enough
from
edinburgh
to
make
personal
attention
to
it
impossible
his
wife
margaret
whose
portrait
hung
in
the
had
done
all
the
business
for
many
years
but
margaret
was
dead
and
perhaps
david
who
had
been
a
devoted
husband
felt
the
need
of
something
besides
the
law
to
fill
up
his
life
he
was
a
lonely
man
for
he
had
no
children
and
his
brother
james
who
sat
opposite
to
him
was
his
junior
by
years
for
one
who
had
attained
to
his
position
he
was
slow
and
curiously
dependent
on
others
there
was
a
turn
about
the
lines
of
his
countenance
which
suggested
fretfulness
and
his
eyes
which
had
looked
upon
so
many
criminals
could
be
anxious
he
was
a
considerate
landlord
and
in
spite
of
the
times
in
which
he
lived
and
the
bottle
at
his
elbow
a
person
of
very
sober
habits
james
logie
who
had
started
his
career
in
lord
orkney
regiment
of
foot
with
the
scots
brigade
in
holland
had
the
same
fresh
complexion
as
his
brother
and
the
same
dark
blue
eyes
but
they
were
eyes
that
had
a
different
expression
and
that
seemed
to
see
one
thing
at
a
time
he
was
a
squarer
shorter
man
than
lord
balnillo
quicker
of
speech
and
movement
his
mouth
was
a
little
crooked
for
the
centre
of
his
lower
lip
did
not
come
exactly
under
the
centre
of
the
upper
one
and
this
slight
mistake
on
the
part
of
nature
had
given
his
face
a
not
unpleasant
look
of
virility
most
people
who
passed
james
gave
him
a
second
glance
both
men
were
carefully
dressed
and
wore
fine
cambric
cravats
and
laced
coats
and
the
shoes
of
the
judge
which
rested
on
the
fender
were
adorned
by
gilt
buckles
they
had
been
silent
for
some
time
as
people
are
who
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
and
find
that
there
is
no
more
to
say
and
in
the
quietness
the
heavy
undercurrent
of
sound
from
the
coast
seemed
to
grow
more
insistent
the
bar
is
very
loud
jamie
said
lord
balnillo
i
doubt
but
there
bad
weather
coming
and
i
am
loth
to
lose
more
trees
i
see
that
the
old
beech
by
the
stables
wants
a
limb
observed
the
other
that
the
only
change
about
the
place
that
i
notice
there
be
more
yet
said
the
judge
you
grown
since
you
left
edinburgh
david
i
had
other
matters
to
think
upon
there
answered
balnillo
with
some
pomp
james
smiled
faintly
making
the
little
twist
in
his
lip
more
apparent
come
out
to
the
steps
and
look
at
the
night
said
he
snatching
like
most
restless
men
at
the
chance
of
movement
they
went
out
through
the
hall
james
unbarred
the
front
door
and
the
two
stood
at
the
top
of
the
flight
of
stone
steps
the
entrance
to
balnillo
house
faced
northward
and
a
wet
wind
from
the
east
slight
still
but
rising
struck
upon
their
right
cheeks
and
carried
the
heavy
muffled
booming
in
through
the
trees
balnillo
looked
frowning
at
their
tops
which
had
begun
to
sway
but
his
brother
attention
was
fixed
upon
a
man
figure
which
was
emerging
from
the
darkness
of
the
grass
park
in
front
of
them
who
is
that
cried
the
judge
as
the
footsteps
grew
audible
it
a
coach
at
the
ford
ma
lord
a
muckle
coach
that
couped
the
water
wully
an
tam
an
andrew
robieson
are
seekin
to

but
it
fast
ma
lord

anyone

it
interrupted
james
ay
there
was
but
he
oot
noo
where
is
he
he
na
get
forward
the
night
continued
the
man
ane
of
the
horse
is
lame
he
cursin
ma
lord
an
nae
wonder
he
can
curse
bonnie
robieson
got
his
wee
laddie
wi
him
and
he
gar
the
loonie
put
his
hands
to
his
lugs
he
an
elder
ye
see
the
judge
turned
to
his
brother
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
the
ford
in
the
den
of
balnillo
had
been
the
scene
of
disaster
for
there
was
an
unlucky
hole
in
it
and
the
state
of
the
roads
made
and
bedraggled
visitors
common
apparitions
in
the
lives
of
country
gentlemen
if
ye
come
wi
me
ma
lord
ye
hear
him
said
the
labourer
to
whom
the
profane
victim
of
the
ford
was
evidently
an
object
of
admiration
balnillo
looked
down
at
his
silk
stockings
and
buckled
shoes
i
should
be
telling
the
lasses
to
get
a
bed
ready
he
remarked
hurriedly
as
he
the
house
james
was
already
throwing
his
leg
across
the
fence
though
it
was
scarcely
the
cursing
which
attracted
him
for
he
had
heard
oaths
to
suit
every
taste
in
his
time
he
hurried
across
the
grass
after
the
labourer
the
night
was
not
very
dark
and
they
made
straight
for
the
ford
the
den
of
balnillo
ran
from
north
to
south
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
house
and
the
long
chain
of
miry
hollows
and
which
did
duty
for
a
high
road
from
perth
to
aberdeen
plunged
through
it
at
the
point
for
which
the
men
were
heading
it
was
a
steep
ravine
filled
with
trees
and
stones
through
which
the
balnillo
burn
flowed
and
fell
and
scrambled
at
different
levels
on
its
way
to
join
the
basin
of
montrose
as
the
great
estuary
of
the
river
esk
was
called
the
ford
lay
just
above
one
of
the
falls
by
which
the
water
leaped
downwards
and
the
dense
darkness
of
the
surrounding
trees
made
it
difficult
for
captain
logie
to
see
what
was
happening
as
he
descended
into
the
black
well
of
the
den
he
could
distinguish
a
confusion
of
objects
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
which
his
brother
men
had
brought
and
set
upon
a
stone
the
ford
itself
reflected
nothing
for
it
was
churned
up
into
a
sea
of
mud
in
which
as
logie
approached
the
outline
of
a
carriage
lying
upon
its
side
became
visible
yonder
the
captain
coming
said
a
voice
someone
lifted
the
lantern
and
he
found
himself
confronted
by
a
tall
young
man
whose
features
he
could
not
see
but
who
was
no
doubt
the
expert
in
language
sir
he
said
i
fear
you
have
had
a
bad
accident
i
am
come
from
lord
balnillo
to
find
out
what
he
can
do
for
you
his
lordship
is
mighty
good
replied
the
young
man
and
if
he
could
force
this
which
i
am
told
belongs
to
him
to
yield
up
my
conveyance
i
should
be
his
servant
for
life
there
was
a
charm
and
softness
in
his
voice
which
nullified
the
brisk
impertinence
of
his
words
i
hope
you
are
not
hurt
said
james
not
at
all
sir
providence
has
spared
me
but
he
has
had
no
mercy
upon
one
of
my
poor
nags
which
has
broken
its
knees
nor
on
my
which
is
in
the
water
i
am
a
travelling
painter
he
added
quickly
and
had
best
introduce
myself
my
name
is
archibald
flemington
the
stranger
had
a
difficulty
in
pronouncing
his
he
spoke
them
like
a
frenchman
with
a
purring
roll
the
other
was
rather
taken
aback
painters
in
those
days
had
not
the
standing
in
society
that
they
have
now
but
the
voice
and
manner
were
unmistakably
those
of
a
man
of
breeding
even
his
freedom
was
not
the
upstart
licence
of
one
trying
to
assert
himself
but
the
easy
expression
of
a
roving
imagination
i
should
introduce
myself
too
said
logie
i
am
captain
james
logie
lord
balnillo
brother
but
we
must
rescue
your
your
baggage
where
is
your
postilion
flemington
held
up
the
lantern
again
and
its
rays
fell
upon
a
man
holding
the
two
horses
which
were
standing
together
under
a
tree
james
went
towards
them
poor
beast
said
he
as
he
saw
the
knees
of
one
of
the
pair
he
would
be
better
in
a
stall
andrew
robieson
send
your
boy
to
the
house
for
a
light
and
then
you
can
guide
them
to
the
stables
meanwhile
the
two
other
men
had
almost
succeeded
in
getting
the
carriage
once
more
upon
its
wheels
and
with
the
help
of
flemington
and
logie
it
was
soon
righted
they
decided
to
leave
it
where
it
was
for
the
night
and
it
was
dragged
a
little
aside
lest
it
should
prove
a
pitfall
to
any
chance
traveller
who
might
pass
before
morning
the
two
gentlemen
went
towards
the
house
together
and
the
men
followed
carring
flemington
possessions
and
the
great
square
package
containing
his
canvases
when
they
entered
the
library
lord
balnillo
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
i
have
brought
flemington
brother
said
logie
his
coach
has
come
to
grief
in
the
den
archie
stopped
short
and
putting
his
heels
together
made
much
the
same
bow
as
he
had
made
to
duthie
eighteen
years
before
a
feeling
of
admiration
went
through
james
as
the
warm
light
of
the
house
revealed
the
person
of
his
companion
and
something
in
the
shrewd
wrinkles
round
his
brother
unimpressive
eyes
irritated
him
he
felt
a
vivid
interest
in
the
stranger
and
the
cautious
old
demeanour
seemed
to
have
raised
the
atmosphere
of
a
round
himself
he
was
surveying
the
with
stiff
urbanity
but
archie
made
small
account
of
it
sir
said
balnillo
with
condescension
if
you
will
oblige
me
by
making
yourself
at
home
until
you
can
continue
your
road
i
shall
take
myself
for
fortunate
my
lord
replied
archie
if
you
knew
how
like
heaven
this
house
appears
to
me
after
the
bottomless
pit
in
your
den
you
might
take
yourself
for
the
almighty
balnillo
gave
his
guest
a
critical
look
and
was
met
by
all
the
soft
darkness
of
a
pair
of
liquid
brown
eyes
which
drooped
at
the
outer
corners
and
were
set
under
thick
brows
following
their
downward
lines
gentleness
inquiry
appeal
were
in
them
and
a
quality
which
the
judge
like
other
observers
could
not
define
a
quality
that
sat
far
far
back
from
the
surface
in
spite
of
the
eyes
there
was
no
suggestion
of
weakness
in
the
slight
young
man
and
his
long
chin
gave
his
olive
face
gravity
speech
and
looks
corresponded
so
little
in
him
that
balnillo
was
bewildered
but
he
was
a
hospitable
man
and
he
moved
aside
to
make
room
for
archie
on
the
hearth
the
latter
was
a
sorry
sight
as
far
as
mud
went
for
his
coat
was
splashed
and
his
legs
from
the
knee
down
were
of
the
colour
of
clay
he
held
his
hands
out
to
the
blaze
stretching
his
fingers
as
a
cat
stretches
her
claws
under
a
caressing
touch
sit
down
and
put
your
feet
to
the
fire
said
the
judge
drawing
forward
one
of
the
large
armchairs
and
james
do
you
call
for
another
glass
when
did
you
dine
mr
flemington
i
did
not
dine
at
all
my
lord
i
was
anxious
to
push
on
to
montrose
and
i
pushed
on
to
destruction
instead
he
looked
up
with
such
a
whimsical
smile
at
his
own
mishaps
that
balnillo
found
his
mouth
widening
in
sympathy
i
will
go
and
tell
them
to
make
some
food
ready
said
the
captain
in
answer
to
a
sign
from
his
brother
balnillo
stood
contemplating
the
young
man
the
lines
round
his
eyes
were
relaxing
a
little
he
was
fundamentally
inquisitive
and
his
companion
matched
no
type
he
had
ever
seen
he
was
a
little
disturbed
by
his
assurance
yet
his
instinct
of
patronage
was
tickled
by
the
situation
i
am
infinitely
grateful
to
you
said
archie
i
know
all
the
inns
in
brechin
and
am
very
sensible
how
much
better
i
am
likely
to
dine
here
than
there
you
are
too
kind
then
you
know
these
parts
my
home
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
county
at
ardguys
i
am
familiar
with
the
name
said
balnillo
but
until
lately
i
have
been
so
much
in
edinburgh
that
i
am
out
of
touch
with
other
places
i
am
not
even
aware
to
whom
it
belongs
it
is
a
little
property
my
lord
nothing
but
a
few
fields
and
a
battered
old
house
but
it
belongs
to
my
grandmother
flemington
who
brought
me
up
she
lives
very
quietly
indeed
indeed
said
the
judge
his
mind
making
a
cast
for
a
clue
as
a
hound
does
for
the
scent
he
was
not
successful
i
had
not
taken
you
for
a
scot
he
said
after
a
moment
i
have
been
told
that
said
archie
and
that
reminds
me
that
it
would
be
proper
to
tell
your
lordship
what
i
am
i
am
a
painter
and
at
this
moment
your
hall
is
full
of
my
paraphernalia
lord
balnillo
did
not
usually
show
his
feelings
but
the
look
which
in
spite
of
himself
flitted
across
his
face
sent
a
gleam
of
entertainment
through
archie
you
are
surprised
he
observed
sighing
but
when
a
man
has
to
mend
his
fortunes
he
must
mend
them
with
what
tools
he
can
nor
am
i
ashamed
of
my
trade
there
is
no
need
flemington
replied
the
other
with
the
measured
benevolence
he
had
sometimes
used
upon
the
bench
what
you
tell
me
does
you
honour
much
honour
sir
then
you
did
not
take
me
for
a
painter
any
more
than
for
a
scot
said
archie
smiling
at
his
host
i
did
not
sir
said
the
judge
shortly
he
was
not
accustomed
to
be
questioned
by
his
witnesses
and
he
had
the
uncomfortable
sensation
of
being
impelled
in
spite
of
a
certain
prejudice
to
think
moderately
well
of
his
guest
i
have
heard
tell
of
your
lordship
very
often
said
the
latter
suddenly
and
i
know
very
well
into
what
good
hands
i
have
fallen
i
could
wish
that
all
the
world
was
more
like
yourself
he
turned
his
head
and
stared
wistfully
at
the
coals
balnillo
could
not
make
out
whether
this
young
fellow
assurance
or
his
humility
was
the
real
to
the
man
but
he
liked
some
of
his
sentiments
well
enough
archie
wore
his
own
hair
and
the
old
man
noticed
how
silky
and
fine
the
brown
waves
were
in
the
firelight
they
were
so
near
his
hand
as
their
owner
leaned
forward
that
he
could
almost
have
stroked
them
are
you
going
further
than
montrose
he
inquired
i
had
hoped
to
cozen
a
little
employment
out
of
aberdeen
replied
flemington
but
it
is
a
mere
speculation
i
have
a
gallery
of
the
most
attractive
canvases
with
me
women
divines
children
magistrates
provosts
all
headless
and
all
waiting
to
see
what
faces
chance
and
i
may
fit
on
to
their
necks
i
have
one
lady
an
angel
i
assure
you
my
lord
a
vision
of
green
silk
and
white
roses
shoulders
like
satin
the
hands
of
venus
balnillo
was
further
bewildered
he
knew
little
about
the
arts
and
nothing
about
artists
he
had
looked
at
many
a
contemporary
portrait
without
suspecting
that
the
original
had
chosen
as
sitters
often
did
an
agreeable
figure
from
a
selection
brought
forward
by
a
painter
on
which
to
display
his
or
her
countenance
it
was
a
custom
which
saved
the
trouble
of
many
sittings
and
rectified
much
of
the
niggardliness
or
of
nature
i
puzzle
you
i
see
added
archie
laughing
and
no
doubt
the
hair
of
van
dyck
would
stand
on
end
at
some
of
our
modern
doings
but
i
am
not
van
dyck
unhappily
and
in
common
with
some
others
i
do
half
my
business
before
my
sitters
ever
see
me
a
client
has
only
to
choose
a
suitable
body
for
his
own
head
and
i
can
tell
you
that
many
are
thankful
to
have
the
opportunity
i
had
no
idea
that
portraits
were
done
like
that
said
lord
balnillo
i
never
heard
of
such
an
arrangement
before
but
you
do
not
think
it
wrong
i
hope
exclaimed
flemington
the
gaiety
dying
out
of
his
face
there
is
no
fraud
about
it
it
is
not
as
if
a
man
deceived
his
sitter
the
distress
in
his
voice
struck
balnillo
and
almost
touched
him
there
was
something
so
simple
and
confiding
in
it
it
might
have
entertained
your
lordship
to
see
them
continued
archie
ruefully
i
should
have
liked
to
show
you
the
strange
company
i
travel
with
so
you
shall
flemington
said
the
old
man
it
would
entertain
me
very
greatly
i
only
fear
that
the
lady
with
the
white
roses
may
enslave
me
he
added
with
rather
obvious
jocosity
indeed
now
is
the
time
for
that
replied
archie
his
face
lighting
up
again
for
i
hope
she
may
soon
wear
the
head
of
some
fat
town
councillor
wife
of
aberdeen
as
he
spoke
captain
logie
returned
with
the
news
that
dinner
was
prepared
i
have
been
out
to
the
stable
to
see
what
we
could
do
for
your
horses
said
he
thank
you
a
thousand
times
sir
exclaimed
archie
lord
balnillo
watched
his
brother
as
he
led
the
painter
to
the
door
i
think
i
will
come
too
and
sit
with
flemington
while
he
eats
he
said
after
a
moment
hesitation
a
couple
of
hours
later
archie
found
himself
in
a
comfortable
bedroom
his
valise
had
been
soaked
in
the
ford
and
a
nightshirt
of
lord
balnillo
was
warming
at
the
fire
when
he
had
put
it
on
he
went
and
looked
at
himself
in
an
mirror
which
hung
on
the
wall
he
was
a
good
deal
taller
than
the
judge
but
it
was
not
his
own
image
that
caused
the
indescribable
expression
on
his
face
chapter
iii
a
archie
sat
in
his
bedroom
at
a
table
the
window
was
open
for
it
was
a
soft
october
afternoon
and
he
looked
out
meditatively
at
the
prospect
before
him
the
wind
that
had
howled
in
the
night
had
spent
itself
towards
morning
and
by
midday
the
tormented
sky
had
cleared
and
the
curtain
of
cloud
rolled
away
leaving
a
mellow
sun
smiling
over
the
basin
of
montrose
he
had
never
been
within
some
miles
of
balnillo
and
the
aspect
of
this
piece
of
the
country
being
new
to
him
his
eye
rested
appreciatively
on
what
he
saw
two
avenues
of
ancient
trees
ran
southward
one
on
either
side
of
the
house
and
a
succession
of
grass
fields
sloped
away
before
him
between
these
bands
of
timber
to
the
tidal
estuary
where
the
water
lay
blue
and
quiet
with
the
ribbon
of
the
south
esk
winding
into
it
from
the
west
beyond
it
the
low
hills
with
their
gentle
rise
touched
the
horizon
nearer
at
hand
the
beeches
and
so
dear
to
lord
balnillo
heart
were
red
and
gold
here
and
there
where
the
gale
had
thinned
the
leaves
the
bareness
of
stem
and
bough
let
in
glimpses
of
the
distant
purple
which
was
the
veil
of
the
farther
atmosphere
to
the
east
shut
out
from
his
sight
by
all
this
wood
was
the
town
of
montrose
set
with
its
pointed
steeple
like
the
blue
silhouette
of
some
dutch
town
between
the
basin
and
the
north
sea
a
pen
was
in
flemington
hand
and
the
very
long
letter
he
had
just
written
was
before
him
balnillo
house
madam
my
dear
grandmother
i
beg
you
to
look
upon
the
address
at
the
head
of
this
letter
and
to
judge
whether
fortune
has
favoured
your
devoted
grandson
i
am
the
very
and
what
is
more
seem
like
to
remain
there
indefinitely
could
anything
in
this
untoward
world
have
fallen
out
better
montrose
is
a
bare
three
miles
from
where
i
sit
and
i
can
betake
myself
there
on
business
when
necessary
while
i
live
as
secluded
as
i
please
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
very
persons
whose
acquaintance
i
had
laid
so
many
plots
to
compass
my
dear
grandmother
could
you
but
have
seen
me
last
night
when
i
lay
down
after
my
labours
tricked
out
in
my
worshipful
host
nightshirt
though
the
honest
man
is
something
of
a
fop
in
his
attire
his
arms
are
not
so
long
as
mine
and
the
fine
ruffles
on
the
sleeves
did
little
more
than
adorn
my
elbows
which
made
me
feel
like
a
lady
till
i
looked
at
my
skirts
then
i
felt
more
like
a
highlandman
but
i
am
telling
you
only
effects
when
you
are
wanting
causes
i
changed
horses
at
brechin
having
got
so
far
in
safety
just
after
dark
and
went
on
towards
montrose
with
the
wind
rising
and
never
a
star
to
look
comfort
at
me
through
the
coach
window
though
i
knew
we
must
be
on
the
right
road
i
asked
my
way
at
every
hovel
we
passed
and
was
much
interested
when
i
was
told
that
i
was
at
the
edge
of
my
lord
balnillo
estate
and
not
far
from
his
house
the
road
soon
afterwards
took
a
plunge
into
the
very
vilest
place
i
ever
saw
a
steep
way
scarcely
fit
for
a
between
a
mass
of
trees
i
put
out
my
head
and
heard
the
rushing
of
water
oh
what
a
fine
thing
memory
is
i
remembered
having
heard
of
the
den
of
balnillo
and
being
told
that
it
was
near
balnillo
house
and
i
judged
we
must
be
there
another
minute
and
we
were
clattering
among
stones
the
water
was
up
to
the
axle
and
we
rocked
like
a
ship
one
wheel
was
higher
than
the
other
and
we
leaned
over
so
that
i
could
scarcely
sit
then
i
was
inspired
i
threw
myself
with
all
my
weight
against
the
side
and
dragged
so
much
of
my
cargo
of
canvases
as
i
could
lay
hold
of
with
me
there
was
a
great
splash
and
over
we
went
it
was
mighty
hard
work
getting
out
for
the
devil
caused
the
door
to
stick
fast
and
i
had
to
crawl
through
the
window
at
that
side
of
the
coach
which
was
turned
to
the
sky
like
a
roof
i
hope
i
may
never
be
colder
we
turned
to
and
got
the
horses
out
and
on
to
dry
ground
and
the
postilion
a
very
frog
for
slime
and
mud
began
to
shout
which
soon
produced
a
couple
of
men
with
a
lantern
i
shouted
too
and
did
my
poor
best
in
the
way
of
oaths
to
give
the
affair
all
the
colour
of
reality
i
could
and
i
believe
i
was
successful
the
noise
brought
more
people
about
us
and
with
them
my
lord
brother
captain
logie
hurrying
to
the
rescue
with
a
fellow
who
had
run
to
the
house
with
news
of
our
trouble
the
result
was
that
we
ended
our
night
the
coach
with
a
cracked
axle
and
a
hole
in
the
panel
the
postilion
in
the
servants
hall
with
half
a
bottle
of
good
scots
whisky
inside
him
the
horses
one
with
a
broken
knee
in
the
stable
and
myself
as
i
tell
you
in
his
lordship
nightshirt
i
promise
you
that
i
thought
myself
happy
when
i
got
inside
the
mansion
a
solemn
block
with
a
grand
manner
of
its
own
and
corinthian
pillars
in
the
his
lordship
was
on
the
hearthrug
as
solemn
as
his
house
but
with
a
pinched
precise
look
which
it
has
not
got
he
was
no
easy
nut
to
crack
and
it
took
me
a
little
time
to
establish
myself
with
him
but
the
good
james
his
brother
left
us
a
little
while
alone
and
i
made
all
the
way
i
could
in
his
favour
i
may
have
trouble
with
the
old
man
and
at
any
rate
must
be
always
at
my
best
with
him
for
he
seems
to
me
to
be
silly
virtuous
and
cunning
all
at
once
he
is
vain
too
and
suspicious
and
has
seen
so
many
wicked
people
in
his
judicial
career
that
i
must
not
let
him
confound
me
with
them
i
could
see
that
he
had
difficulty
in
making
my
occupation
and
appearance
match
to
his
satisfaction
he
wears
a
velvet
coat
and
is
very
nice
in
the
details
of
his
dress
i
should
like
you
to
see
him
not
because
he
would
amuse
you
but
because
it
would
entertain
me
so
completely
to
see
you
together
james
his
brother
is
cut
to
a
very
different
pattern
he
is
many
years
younger
than
his
lordship
not
a
dozen
years
older
than
myself
i
imagine
and
he
has
spent
much
of
his
life
with
lord
regiment
in
holland
there
is
something
mighty
attractive
in
his
face
though
i
can
not
make
out
what
it
is
it
is
strange
that
though
he
seems
to
be
a
much
simpler
person
than
the
old
man
i
feel
less
able
to
describe
him
i
have
had
much
talk
with
him
this
morning
and
i
do
know
when
i
have
liked
anyone
better
and
now
comes
the
triumph
of
the
climax
to
which
all
this
faithful
record
leads
i
am
to
paint
his
lordship
portrait
in
his
judge
robes
and
am
installed
here
definitely
for
that
purpose
i
shall
be
grateful
if
you
will
send
me
my
suit
and
a
couple
of
fine
shirts
also
the
silk
stockings
which
are
in
the
top
shelf
of
my
cupboard
and
all
you
can
lay
hands
on
in
the
matter
of
cravats
my
valise
was
soaked
through
and
through
and
though
the
clothes
i
am
wearing
were
dried
in
the
night
i
am
rather
short
of
good
coats
for
i
expected
to
end
in
an
inn
at
montrose
rather
than
in
a
gentleman
house
though
i
am
within
reach
of
ardguys
and
might
ride
to
fetch
them
in
person
i
do
not
want
to
be
absent
unnecessarily
any
letters
that
i
may
send
you
will
go
by
a
hand
i
know
of
i
shall
go
shortly
to
montrose
by
way
of
procuring
myself
some
small
necessity
and
shall
search
for
that
hand
its
owner
should
not
be
difficult
to
recognize
by
all
accounts
and
now
my
dear
grandmother
i
shall
write
myself
your
dutiful
and
devoted
grandson
archibald
flemington
archie
sealed
his
letter
and
then
rose
and
leaned
far
out
of
the
window
the
sun
still
bathed
the
land
but
it
was
getting
low
the
were
thrusting
their
heads
into
a
light
which
had
already
left
the
slanting
away
from
the
house
the
latter
part
of
his
morning
had
been
taken
up
by
his
host
slow
inspection
of
his
canvases
and
he
longed
for
a
sight
of
his
surroundings
he
knew
that
the
brothers
had
gone
out
together
and
he
took
his
hat
and
stood
irresolute
with
his
letter
in
his
hand
before
a
little
locked
case
which
he
had
himself
rescued
the
night
before
from
among
his
submerged
belongings
in
the
coach
hesitating
whether
he
should
commit
the
paper
to
it
or
keep
it
upon
his
own
person
it
seemed
to
be
a
matter
for
some
consideration
finally
he
put
it
into
his
pocket
and
went
out
he
set
forth
down
one
of
the
avenues
walking
on
a
gorgeous
carpet
of
fallen
leaves
and
came
out
on
a
road
running
east
and
west
evidently
another
connecting
brechin
with
montrose
he
smiled
as
he
considered
it
realizing
that
had
he
taken
it
last
night
he
would
have
escaped
the
den
of
balnillo
and
many
more
desirable
things
at
the
same
time
as
he
stood
looking
up
and
down
he
heard
a
liquid
rush
and
saw
to
his
right
a
glimmering
through
the
trees
evidently
the
goal
of
the
waters
which
had
soused
him
so
lately
he
strolled
towards
it
attracted
by
the
forest
of
stems
and
golden
foliage
reflected
in
the
pool
and
by
the
slide
down
which
the
stream
poured
into
a
field
to
wind
like
a
little
serpent
through
the
grass
just
where
it
disappeared
stood
a
stone
abutting
on
the
highway
from
which
came
the
clacking
of
a
wheel
the
miller
was
at
his
door
archie
could
see
that
he
was
watching
something
with
interest
for
the
man
stood
out
a
distinct
white
figure
on
the
steps
running
up
from
the
road
to
the
gaping
doorway
in
the
flemington
was
one
of
those
blessed
people
for
whom
common
sights
do
not
glide
by
a
mere
meaningless
procession
of
alien
things
humanity
smallest
actions
had
an
interest
for
him
for
he
had
that
love
of
seeing
effect
follow
cause
which
is
at
once
priceless
and
childish
priceless
because
anything
that
lifts
from
us
the
irritating
burden
of
ourselves
for
so
much
as
a
moment
is
priceless
and
childish
because
it
is
a
survival
of
the
years
when
all
the
universe
was
new
priceless
yet
again
because
it
will
often
lead
us
down
unexpected
of
knowledge
in
a
world
in
which
knowledge
is
power
he
sat
down
on
the
low
wall
bounding
the
for
he
was
determined
to
know
what
the
miller
was
staring
at
whatever
it
was
it
was
on
the
farther
side
of
a
cottage
built
just
across
the
road
from
the
mill
he
was
suddenly
conscious
that
a
little
girl
with
hair
had
appeared
from
nowhere
and
was
standing
beside
him
she
also
was
staring
at
the
house
by
the
mill
but
with
occasional
furtive
glances
at
himself
all
at
once
the
heavy
drone
of
a
bagpipe
came
towards
them
then
the
shrill
notes
of
the
chanter
began
to
meander
up
and
down
on
the
blare
of
sonorous
sound
like
a
light
pattern
running
over
a
dark
background
the
little
girl
removed
her
eyes
from
the
stranger
and
cut
a
caper
with
her
bare
feet
as
though
she
would
like
to
dance
it
was
evident
that
the
sounds
had
affected
flemington
too
but
not
in
the
same
way
he
made
a
sharp
exclamation
under
his
breath
and
turned
to
the
child
who
is
that
playing
he
cried
putting
out
his
hand
she
jumped
back
and
stood
staring
who
is
that
playing
he
repeated
she
was
still
dumb
scrubbing
one
foot
against
her
bare
ankle
after
the
manner
of
the
shoeless
when
embarrassed
archie
was
exasperated
he
rose
without
further
noticing
the
child
and
hurried
towards
the
mill
when
he
had
reached
the
place
where
the
stream
dived
through
a
stone
arch
under
the
road
he
found
she
was
following
him
he
heard
the
pad
pad
of
her
naked
soles
in
the
mud
all
at
once
she
was
moved
to
answer
his
question
yon
skirlin
wattie
she
yelled
after
him
but
he
strode
on
taking
no
notice
fortune
was
playing
into
his
hand
so
wonderfully
that
he
was
ceasing
to
be
surprised
in
the
little
yard
of
the
cottage
he
found
a
small
crowd
of
children
two
women
and
the
miller
man
collected
round
the
strangest
assortment
of
living
creatures
he
had
ever
seen
the
name
wattie
had
conveyed
something
to
him
and
he
was
prepared
for
the
extraordinary
but
his
breath
was
almost
taken
away
by
the
oddness
of
what
he
saw
in
the
middle
of
the
group
was
a
stout
wooden
box
which
mounted
on
very
low
wheels
was
transformed
into
the
likeness
of
a
rough
and
to
this
were
yoked
five
dogs
of
differing
breeds
and
sizes
a
mastiff
in
the
wheel
of
the
team
was
taking
advantage
of
the
halt
and
lay
dozing
his
jowl
on
his
paws
undisturbed
by
the
blast
of
sound
which
poured
over
his
head
whilst
his
companion
a
large
yellow
cur
stood
alert
with
an
almost
proprietary
interest
in
what
was
going
on
awake
in
his
amber
eyes
the
couple
of
collies
in
front
of
them
sniffed
furtively
at
the
bystanders
and
the
terrier
which
as
leader
was
harnessed
singly
in
advance
of
the
lot
was
sharing
a
bannock
with
a
the
sinister
nature
of
whose
squint
almost
made
the
dog
confidence
seem
misplaced
the
occupant
of
the
cart
was
an
elderly
man
whom
accident
had
deprived
of
the
lower
part
of
his
legs
both
of
which
had
been
amputated
just
below
the
knee
he
had
the
head
of
falstaff
the
shoulders
of
hercules
and
lack
of
exercise
had
made
his
thighs
and
back
bulge
out
over
the
sides
of
his
carriage
even
as
the
bag
of
his
pipes
bulged
under
his
elbow
he
was
dressed
in
tartan
breeches
and
doublet
and
he
wore
a
huge
kilmarnock
bonnet
with
a
red
knob
on
the
top
the
lower
half
of
his
face
was
distended
by
his
occupation
and
at
the
appearance
of
flemington
by
the
gate
he
turned
on
him
above
the
billows
of
crimson
cheek
and
grizzled
whisker
the
boldest
pair
of
eyes
that
the
young
man
had
ever
met
he
was
a
masterly
piper
and
as
the
tune
stopped
a
murmur
of
applause
went
through
the
audience
man
ye
the
most
mountaineous
player
in
scotland
said
the
miller
man
who
was
a
coiner
of
words
aye
dod
am
i
replied
the
piper
hae
continued
the
miller
man
holding
out
an
apple
the
beggar
took
it
with
that
silent
wag
of
the
back
of
the
head
which
seems
peculiar
to
the
east
coast
of
scotland
and
dropped
it
into
the
cart
archie
handed
him
a
sixpence
ye

to
gie
us

cried
the
squinting
child
whose
eyes
had
seen
straight
enough
and
who
seemed
to
have
a
keen
sense
of
values
aye
a
sang
this
time
added
its
mother

chimed
in
an
old
woman
who
had
suddenly
put
her
head
out
of
the
upper
story
of
the
cottage
the
beggar
laid
down
his
pipes
and
spat
on
earth
then
he
opened
his
mouth
and
gave
forth
a
voice
whose
volume
flexibility
and
extreme
sweetness
seemed
incredible
considering
the
being
from
whom
it
emanated

archie
beat
the
top
rail
of
the
paling
with
so
much
enthusiasm
that
the
yellow
cur
began
to
bark
the
beggar
quieted
him
with
a
storm
of
abuse
the
beldame
disappeared
from
the
window
and
her
steps
could
be
heard
descending
the
wooden
stair
of
the
cottage
she
approached
the
cart
with
a
handful
of
meal
on
a
platter
which
skirling
wattie
tilted
into
an
old
leather
bag
that
hung
on
his
carriage
whaur
the
bawbee
cried
the
squinting
child
a
shout
of
laughter
went
up
led
by
archie
he
kens
there
nae
muckle
weicht
o
meal
and
wha
should
ken
it
better
said
the
beggar
balancing
the
bag
on
his
palm
and
winking
at
the
miller
man
the
latter
who
happened
to
be
the
child
unacknowledged
parent
disappeared
behind
the
house
one
more
song
and
i
will
supply
the
bawbee
said
archie
throwing
another
coin
into
the
cart
skirling
wattie
sent
a
considering
glance
at
his
patron
though
he
might
not
understand
refinement
he
could
recognize
it
and
much
of
his
local
success
had
come
from
his
nice
appraisement
of
audiences
i
gie
ye
logie
kirk
said
he
o
logie
kirk
among
the
braes
i
thinkin
o
the
merry
days
afore
i
trod
the
weary
ways
that
led

frae

when
i
was

and
ilka

had
a

me
back

tho

the

a

to
cry
hame
to

far
awa

decline
that
took
the
lassie
wha
was
mine
and
laid
her
sleepin
lang
lang
syne
among
the
braes
at
logie
his
voice
and
the
wonderful
pathos
of
his
phrasing
fascinated
archie
but
as
the
last
cadences
fell
from
his
mouth
the
beggar
snatched
up
the
long
switch
with
which
he
drove
his
team
and
began
to
roar
a
awa
he
shouted
making
every
wall
and
corner
echo
open
the
gate
an
let
me
through
ye
misbegotten
bairns
o
auld
nick
stand

me
out
round
about
an
up
the
road
just
round
about
an
up
the
road
a
tell
ye
the
last
sentences
were
addressed
to
the
dogs
who
were
now
all
on
their
legs
and
mindful
of
the
stick
whirling
in
the
air
above
them
archie
could
see
that
he
was
not
included
in
the
beggar
general
address
but
being
nearest
to
the
gate
he
swung
it
open
and
the
whole
equipage
dashed
through
the
dogs
guided
with
amazing
dexterity
between
the
posts
by
their
master
switch
the
rapid
circle
they
described
on
the
road
as
they
were
turned
up
the
hill
towards
brechin
seemed
likely
to
upset
the
cart
but
the
beggar
leaned
outwards
so
adroitly
that
none
of
the
four
wheels
left
the
ground
as
they
went
up
the
incline
he
took
up
his
pipes
and
leaving
the
team
to
its
own
guidance
tuned
up
and
disappeared
round
the
next
bend
in
a
blast
of
sound
flemington
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
run
after
him
and
could
easily
have
overtaken
the
cart
for
its
pace
was
not
very
formidable
but
the
whole
community
including
the
little
girl
was
watching
skirling
wattie
out
of
sight
and
speculating
he
knew
upon
his
own
identity
so
he
walked
leisurely
on
till
the
road
turned
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
he
was
rewarded
at
the
other
side
of
its
bend
by
the
sight
of
the
beggar
halting
his
team
by
a
pond
at
which
the
dogs
were
drinking
he
threw
a
look
around
and
behind
him
then
as
no
human
creature
was
to
be
seen
he
gave
a
loud
whistle
holding
up
his
arm
and
began
to
run
skirling
wattie
awaited
him
at
the
and
as
archie
approached
he
could
almost
feel
his
bold
eyes
searching
him
from
top
to
toe
he
stopped
by
the
cart
my
name
is
flemington
said
he
a
heard
worse
replied
the
other
calmly
and
i
have
a
description
of
you
in
my
pocket
continued
archie
perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
it
the
beggar
looked
up
at
him
from
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
with
a
smile
of
the
most
robust
and
genial
effrontery
that
he
had
ever
seen
on
a
human
face
a
need
to
said
he
archie
took
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
you
see
that
signature
he
said
putting
his
forefinger
on
it
the
other
reached
up
to
take
the
paper
no
no
said
flemington
this
never
goes
out
of
my
hand
that
you
exclaimed
the
beggar
with
some
admiration
put
it
back
a
ken
it
he
unhooked
his
leather
bag
which
hung
inside
the
cart
on
its
front
board
this
archie
perceived
to
be
made
apparently
for
additional
strength
of
two
thicknesses
of
wood
skirling
wattie
slid
the
inner
plank
upwards
and
the
young
man
saw
a
couple
of
sealed
letters
hidden
behind
it
one
of
which
was
addressed
to
himself
tak
yon
said
the
beggar
as
the
sound
of
a
horse
tread
was
heard
not
far
off
tak
it
quick
an
syne
awa
ye
gang
mind
ye
a
gang
ilka
twa
days
frae
montrose
to
brechin
an
a
aye
skirlin
as
a
gang
and
do
you
take
this
one
and
have
it
sent
on
from
brechin
said
archie
hurriedly
handing
him
the
letter
he
had
written
to
madam
flemington
the
other
wagged
the
back
of
his
head
and
laid
a
finger
against
the
rim
of
his
bonnet
archie
struck
into
the
fields
by
the
pond
and
had
time
to
drop
down
behind
a
before
an
farmer
went
by
on
his
way
between
the
two
towns
the
beggar
continued
his
progress
singing
to
himself
and
flemington
who
did
not
care
to
face
the
mill
and
the
curious
eyes
of
the
little
girl
again
took
a
line
across
country
back
to
balnillo
he
hated
the
little
girl
chapter
iv
business
events
seemed
to
flemington
to
be
moving
fast
lord
balnillo
dined
soon
after
five
and
during
the
meal
the
young
man
tried
to
detach
his
mind
from
the
contents
of
the
letter
lying
in
his
pocket
and
to
listen
to
his
host
talk
which
ran
on
the
portrait
to
be
begun
next
morning
the
judge
had
ordered
his
robes
to
be
taken
out
and
aired
carefully
and
a
little
room
with
a
north
aspect
had
been
prepared
for
the
first
sitting
the
details
of
archie
trade
had
excited
the
household
below
stairs
and
the
servant
who
waited
appeared
to
look
upon
him
with
the
curious
mixture
of
awe
and
contempt
accorded
to
charlatans
and
to
those
connected
with
the
arts
only
james
seemed
to
remain
outside
the
circle
of
interest
like
a
wayfarer
who
pauses
to
watch
the
progress
of
some
wayside
bargain
with
which
he
has
no
concern
yet
though
archie
occupations
did
not
move
logie
the
young
man
felt
intuitively
that
he
was
anything
but
a
hostile
presence
with
your
permission
i
shall
go
early
to
bed
said
flemington
to
his
host
as
the
three
sat
over
their
wine
by
the
fire
and
the
clock
hands
pointed
to
eight
fie
said
the
judge
you
are
a
young
man
to
be
thinking
of
such
things
at
this
hour
my
bones
have
not
forgotten
yesterday
began
archie
and
what
would
you
do
if
you
had
to
ride
the
circuit
sir
exclaimed
balnillo
looking
sideways
at
him
like
a
sly
old
crow
man
james
you
and
i
have
had
other
things
to
consider
besides
our
bones
and
here
flemington
who
might
be
your
son
and
my
grandson
havering
about
his
bed
archie
laughed
aloud
captain
logie
would
need
to
have
married
young
for
that
he
cried
and
i
can
not
picture
your
lordship
as
anybody
grandfather
come
jamie
how
old
are
you
inquired
his
brother
in
a
tone
that
had
a
light
touch
of
gratification
i
lose
count
nowadays
said
james
sighing
i
must
be
near
upon
i
suppose
life
a
long
business
after
all
yours
has
scarcely
been
long
enough
to
have
begotten
me
unless
you
had
done
so
at
twelve
years
old
observed
archie
when
i
had
to
ride
the
circuit
began
balnillo
setting
down
his
glass
and
joining
his
hands
across
his
waistcoat
i
had
many
a
time
to
stick
fast
in
worse
places
than
the
den
yonder
ay
and
to
leave
my
horse
where
he
was
and
get
forward
on
my
clerk
nag
i
been
forced
to
sit
the
bench
in
another
man
wig
because
my
own
had
rolled
in
the
water
in
my
luggage
and
was
a
plaster
of
dirt
maybe
never
fit
to
be
seen
again
upon
a
lord
of
session
head
logie
smiled
with
his
crooked
mouth
he
remembered
though
he
did
not
mention
the
vernacular
rhyme
written
on
that
occasion
by
some
impudent
member
of
the
junior
bar
auld
david
balnillo
gangs
wantin
his
wig
and
he
seekin
the
loan
of
anither
as
big
a
modest
request
an
there
naething
agin
it
but
he
better
hae
soucht
a
new
head
to
put
in
it
it
was
only
last
year
continued
his
brother
that
i
gave
up
the
saddle
and
the
bench
together
that
was
more
from
choice
than
from
necessity
at
least
so
i
have
heard
said
archie
you
heard
that
mr
flemington
my
lord
do
you
think
that
we
obscure
know
nothing
or
that
reputations
do
fly
farther
than
edinburgh
the
truth
is
that
we
of
the
younger
generation
are
not
made
of
the
same
stuff
that
is
what
my
grandmother
tells
me
so
often
so
often
that
from
force
of
habit
i
do
listen
but
i
have
begun
to
believe
it
at
last
she
is
a
wise
woman
said
balnillo
she
has
been
a
mighty
attractive
one
observed
archie
meditatively
at
least
so
she
was
thought
at
st
germain
at
st
germain
exclaimed
the
judge
my
grandfather
died
in
exile
with
his
master
and
my
father
too
replied
flemington
quietly
there
was
a
silence
and
then
james
logie
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
archie
had
risen
let
me
go
lord
balnillo
he
said
the
truth
is
my
work
needs
a
steady
hand
and
i
mean
to
have
it
when
i
begin
your
portrait
when
he
had
gone
james
took
the
empty
seat
by
his
brother
his
grandfather
with
the
king
and
he
following
this
womanish
trade
he
exclaimed
i
should
like
to
have
asked
him
more
about
his
father
said
balnillo
but
he
did
not
wish
to
speak
i
could
see
that
said
james
i
like
the
fellow
david
in
spite
of
his
i
would
like
him
much
if
i
had
time
to
like
anything
i
have
been
asking
myself
am
i
a
fool
to
be
keeping
him
here
said
the
other
was
i
right
to
let
a
strange
man
into
the
house
at
such
a
time
i
am
relieved
james
he
is
on
the
right
side
he
keeps
his
ears
open
brother
he
seems
to
know
all
about
observed
balnillo
he
a
fine
lad
jamie
a
lad
of
fine
taste
and
his
free
tongue
has
interfered
with
his
good
sense
and
i
am
relieved
as
i
said
logie
smiled
again
the
affection
he
had
for
his
brother
was
of
that
solid
quality
which
accepts
a
character
in
the
lump
and
loves
it
for
its
best
parts
david
little
vanities
and
vacillations
his
meticulous
love
of
small
things
were
plain
enough
to
the
soldier
and
he
knew
well
that
the
bench
and
the
bar
alike
had
found
plenty
to
make
merry
over
in
balnillo
he
had
all
the
loyal
feeling
which
the
scot
of
his
time
bore
to
the
head
of
his
family
and
as
his
sentiments
towards
him
sprang
from
the
heart
rather
than
from
the
brain
it
is
possible
that
he
undervalued
the
sudden
fits
of
shrewdness
which
would
attack
his
brother
as
headache
or
ague
might
attack
another
man
the
fact
that
david
colleagues
had
never
made
this
mistake
was
responsible
for
a
career
the
success
of
which
surprised
many
who
knew
the
judge
by
hearsay
alone
drink
detail
and
indecision
have
probably
ruined
more
characters
than
any
three
other
influences
in
the
world
but
the
two
latter
had
not
quite
succeeded
with
lord
balnillo
and
the
former
had
passed
him
over
i
wonder
said
james
i
wonder
is
it
a
good
chance
that
has
sent
him
here
could
we
make
anything
of
him
david
whisht
james
said
the
other
turning
his
face
away
quickly
you
go
too
fast
and
mind
you
if
a
man
has
only
one
notion
in
his
head
there
are
times
when
his
skull
is
scarce
thick
enough
to
stand
between
his
thoughts
and
the
world
that
is
true
but
i
doubt
flemington
mind
is
too
much
taken
up
with
his
pictures
to
think
what
is
in
other
men
heads
maybe
replied
balnillo
but
we
know
that
better
a
few
days
hence
i
am
not
sorry
he
has
gone
to
bed
i
will
give
him
an
hour
to
get
between
his
blankets
said
logie
drawing
out
his
watch
that
should
make
him
safe
meanwhile
flemington
had
reached
his
room
and
was
pulling
his
great
package
of
spare
canvases
from
under
his
sombre
he
undid
the
straps
which
secured
them
and
drew
from
between
two
of
them
a
long
dark
thrusting
back
the
bundle
into
its
place
he
changed
his
clothes
and
threw
those
he
had
taken
off
on
a
chair
then
he
took
the
little
locked
box
he
had
saved
so
carefully
from
the
catastrophe
of
the
previous
night
and
standing
on
the
bed
he
laid
it
on
the
top
of
the
tester
which
was
near
enough
to
the
ceiling
to
prevent
any
object
placed
upon
it
from
being
seen
he
gathered
a
couple
of
cushions
from
a
couch
and
beating
them
up
arranged
them
between
the
bedclothes
patting
them
into
a
shape
though
he
meant
to
lock
his
door
and
to
keep
the
key
in
his
pocket
during
the
absence
he
contemplated
and
though
he
had
desired
the
servants
not
to
disturb
him
until
an
hour
before
breakfast
he
had
the
good
habit
of
preparing
for
the
worst
he
slipped
out
with
the
coat
over
his
arm
turned
the
key
and
walked
softly
but
boldly
down
into
the
hall
he
paused
outside
the
listening
to
the
hum
of
the
brothers
voices
then
disappeared
down
the
if
he
found
the
door
into
the
secured
he
meant
to
call
someone
from
the
kitchen
regions
to
open
it
and
to
announce
that
he
was
going
out
to
look
at
his
disabled
horse
he
would
say
that
he
intended
to
return
through
the
front
door
by
which
captain
logie
had
promised
to
admit
him
everything
was
quiet
the
only
sign
of
life
was
the
shrill
voice
of
a
maid
singing
in
the
scullery
as
she
washed
the
dishes
and
the
house
was
not
shut
up
for
the
night
through
the
yard
he
went
and
out
unmolested
under
the
great
arch
which
supported
the
stable
clock
and
then
ran
swiftly
round
to
the
front
he
passed
under
the
still
lighted
windows
and
plunged
into
a
mass
of
trees
and
undergrowth
which
headed
the
eastern
approach
once
among
the
friendly
shadows
he
put
on
the
coat
buttoning
it
closely
about
his
neck
and
took
a
small
grey
wig
from
one
of
its
deep
pockets
when
he
had
adjusted
this
under
his
hat
he
emerged
crossed
the
avenue
dropped
over
the
sunk
wall
dividing
it
from
the
fields
and
made
down
them
till
he
reached
the
montrose
road
through
the
still
darkness
the
sound
of
the
balnillo
stable
clock
floated
after
him
striking
nine
there
was
not
enough
light
to
show
him
anything
but
his
nearest
surroundings
the
wall
which
bounded
the
great
balnillo
was
at
his
left
hand
and
by
it
he
guided
his
steps
keeping
a
perpetual
look
out
to
avoid
stumbling
over
the
inequalities
and
loose
stones
for
there
were
no
to
the
roads
in
those
days
he
knew
that
the
town
was
only
three
miles
off
and
that
the
dark
stretch
which
extended
on
his
right
was
the
basin
of
montrose
a
cold
snap
played
in
the
air
reminding
him
that
autumn
which
in
scotland
keeps
its
mellowness
late
was
some
way
forward
and
this
sting
in
the
breath
of
night
was
indicated
by
a
trembling
of
the
stars
in
the
dark
vault
overhead
he
hastened
on
for
time
was
precious
the
paper
which
he
had
taken
from
skirling
wattie
hands
had
bid
him
prepare
to
follow
logie
into
the
town
when
dark
set
in
but
it
had
been
able
to
tell
him
neither
at
what
hour
the
soldier
would
start
nor
whether
he
would
walk
or
ride
his
chance
in
meeting
the
beggar
so
soon
had
put
him
in
possession
of
james
usual
movements
immediately
but
it
had
given
him
little
time
to
think
out
many
details
and
the
gaps
in
his
plans
had
been
filled
in
by
guesswork
he
did
not
think
james
would
ride
for
there
had
been
no
sound
of
preparation
in
the
stable
his
intention
was
to
reach
the
town
first
to
conceal
himself
by
its
entrance
and
when
james
should
pass
to
follow
him
to
his
destination
he
had
a
rough
map
of
montrose
in
his
possession
and
with
its
help
he
had
been
able
to
locate
the
house
for
which
he
suspected
him
to
be
bound
a
house
known
by
the
party
he
served
to
be
one
of
the
of
the
adherents
of
charles
edward
stuart
archie
buoyancy
of
spirit
was
sufficient
to
keep
at
arm
length
a
regret
he
could
not
quite
banish
for
he
had
the
happy
carelessness
that
carries
a
man
easily
on
any
errand
which
has
possibilities
of
development
more
from
the
cheerful
love
of
chance
than
from
responsible
feeling
his
courage
and
tenacity
were
buried
so
deep
under
a
luxuriance
of
effrontery
grace
and
and
the
glamour
of
a
manner
difficult
to
resist
that
hardly
anyone
but
madam
flemington
who
had
brought
him
up
suspected
the
toughness
of
their
quality
he
had
the
refinement
of
a
woman
yet
he
had
extorted
the
wonder
of
an
scotsman
by
his
comprehensive
profanity
the
expression
at
times
of
a
timid
girl
yet
he
would
plunge
into
a
flood
of
difficulties
whose
further
shore
he
did
not
trouble
to
contemplate
but
these
contrasts
in
him
spoke
of
no
repression
no
conscious
effort
he
merely
rode
every
quality
in
his
character
with
a
loose
rein
and
while
he
attempted
to
puzzle
nobody
he
had
the
acuteness
to
know
that
his
audience
would
puzzle
itself
by
its
own
conception
of
him
the
regret
which
he
ignored
was
the
regret
that
he
was
obliged
to
shadow
a
man
who
pleased
him
as
much
as
did
james
logie
he
realized
how
much
more
satisfaction
he
would
have
got
out
of
his
present
business
had
its
object
been
lord
balnillo
he
liked
james
voice
his
bearing
his
crooked
mouth
and
something
intangible
about
him
which
he
neither
understood
nor
tried
to
understand
the
iron
hand
of
madam
flemington
had
brought
him
up
so
consistently
to
his
occupation
that
he
accepted
it
as
a
part
of
life
his
painting
he
used
as
a
means
not
as
an
end
and
the
changes
and
chances
of
his
main
employment
were
congenial
to
a
temperament
at
once
boyish
and
capable
the
pleiades
rode
high
above
taurus
and
orion
hands
were
coming
up
over
the
eastern
horizon
as
he
reached
the
narrow
street
which
was
the
beginning
of
montrose
the
place
was
dark
and
like
every
country
town
of
those
days
and
here
by
the
north
port
as
it
was
called
the
irregularities
of
the
low
houses
with
their
outside
stairs
offered
a
choice
of
odd
corners
in
which
he
might
wait
unseen
he
chose
the
narrowest
part
of
the
street
that
he
might
see
across
it
the
more
readily
and
drew
back
into
the
cavity
roofed
in
by
the
of
a
projecting
flight
of
steps
which
ran
sideways
up
a
wall
few
people
would
leave
the
town
at
that
hour
and
those
who
were
still
abroad
were
likely
to
keep
within
its
limits
a
wretched
lamp
stuck
in
a
niche
of
an
opposite
building
made
his
position
all
the
more
desirable
for
the
flicker
which
it
cast
would
be
sufficient
to
throw
up
the
figure
of
logie
should
he
pass
beneath
it
he
watched
a
stealthy
cat
cross
its
shine
with
an
air
of
suppressed
melodrama
that
would
have
befitted
a
tiger
and
the
genial
bellowing
of
a
couple
of
drunken
men
came
down
the
high
street
as
he
settled
his
shoulders
against
the
masonry
at
his
back
and
resigned
himself
to
a
probable
hour
of
tedium
not
a
mile
distant
james
logie
was
coming
along
the
montrose
road
he
had
trodden
it
many
times
in
the
darkness
during
the
past
weeks
and
his
mind
was
roving
far
from
his
steps
far
even
from
the
errand
on
which
he
was
bent
he
was
thinking
of
archie
whom
he
believed
to
be
snug
in
bed
at
balnillo
he
had
gone
out
last
night
and
landed
this
fantastic
piece
of
young
humanity
from
the
den
as
a
man
may
land
a
salmon
and
he
had
contemplated
him
ever
since
with
a
kind
of
fascination
flemington
was
so
much
unlike
any
young
man
he
had
known
that
the
difference
half
shocked
him
and
though
he
had
told
his
brother
that
he
liked
the
fellow
he
had
done
so
in
spite
of
one
side
of
himself
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
but
a
dozen
years
divided
them
for
he
had
imagined
archie
much
younger
and
the
appeal
of
his
boyishness
was
a
strong
one
to
logie
who
had
had
so
little
time
for
boyishness
himself
his
life
since
he
was
fifteen
had
been
merged
in
his
profession
and
the
restoration
of
the
stuarts
had
been
for
many
years
the
thing
nearest
to
his
heart
there
had
been
one
exception
to
this
and
that
had
long
gone
out
of
his
life
taking
his
youth
with
it
he
was
scarcely
a
sad
man
but
he
had
the
habit
of
sadness
which
is
as
hard
a
one
to
combat
as
any
other
and
the
burst
of
youth
and
buoyancy
that
had
come
in
suddenly
with
archie
had
blown
on
james
like
a
spring
wind
father
and
grandfather
had
died
in
exile
too
with
charles
parents
and
his
eyes
reminded
him
of
other
eyes
the
events
that
had
taken
place
since
the
landing
of
the
prince
in
july
had
made
themselves
felt
all
up
the
east
coast
and
the
country
was
jacobite
almost
to
a
man
charles
edward
had
raised
his
standard
at
glenfinnan
had
marched
on
edinburgh
in
the
early
part
of
september
and
had
established
himself
in
holyrood
on
the
surrender
of
the
town
after
his
victory
over
cope
at
preston
pans
he
had
collected
his
forces
on
portobello
sands
thirteen
regiments
composed
of
the
highland
clans
five
regiments
of
lowlanders
two
troops
of
horse
commanded
by
lords
elcho
and
balmerino
with
two
others
under
lord
kilmarnock
and
lord
pitsligo
the
command
of
the
latter
consisted
of
angus
men
armed
with
such
weapons
as
they
owned
or
could
gather
the
insurgent
army
had
entered
england
in
two
portions
one
of
these
led
by
lord
george
murray
and
one
by
the
prince
himself
who
marched
at
the
head
of
his
men
sharing
the
fatigues
of
the
road
with
them
and
fascinating
the
imagination
of
the
scots
by
his
hopeful
and
his
keen
desire
to
identify
himself
with
his
soldiers
the
two
bodies
had
concentrated
on
carlisle
investing
the
city
and
after
a
few
days
of
defiance
the
mayor
displayed
the
white
flag
on
the
ramparts
and
surrendered
the
town
keys
after
this
the
prince
and
his
father
had
been
proclaimed
at
the
market
cross
in
presence
of
the
municipality
but
in
spite
of
this
success
the
signs
of
the
times
were
not
consistently
cheering
to
the
jacobite
party
there
had
been
many
desertions
during
the
march
across
the
border
and
no
sooner
had
the
prince
troops
left
edinburgh
than
the
city
had
gone
back
to
the
whig
dominion
at
perth
and
dundee
the
wind
seemed
to
be
changing
too
and
only
the
country
places
stuck
steadily
to
the
prince
and
went
on
recruiting
for
the
stuarts
although
he
was
aching
to
go
south
with
the
invaders
now
that
the
english
were
advancing
in
force
logie
was
kept
in
the
neighbourhood
of
montrose
by
the
business
he
had
undertaken
his
own
instincts
and
inclinations
were
ever
those
of
a
fighter
and
he
groaned
in
spirit
over
the
fate
which
had
made
it
his
duty
to
remain
in
angus
concerned
with
recruiting
and
the
raising
of
money
and
arms
he
had
not
yet
openly
joined
the
stuarts
in
spite
of
his
ardent
devotion
to
their
cause
because
it
had
been
represented
to
him
that
he
was
for
the
moment
a
more
valuable
asset
to
his
party
whilst
he
worked
secretly
than
he
could
be
in
the
field
the
question
that
perplexed
the
coast
of
angus
was
the
landing
of
those
french
supplies
so
sorely
needed
by
the
troops
in
the
face
of
the
english
cruisers
that
haunted
the
coast
and
it
was
these
matters
that
kept
logie
busy
james
knew
the
harbour
of
montrose
as
men
know
the
places
which
are
the
scenes
of
the
forbidden
exploits
of
their
youth
this
younger
son
who
was
so
far
removed
in
years
from
the
rest
of
his
family
as
to
be
almost
like
an
only
child
was
running
wild
in
the
town
among
the
and
taking
surreptitious
trips
across
the
bar
when
the
staid
david
was
pursuing
his
respectable
career
at
a
very
different
kind
of
bar
in
edinburgh
he
was
the
man
that
montrose
needed
in
this
emergency
and
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
town
for
he
would
come
there
a
couple
of
times
in
the
week
as
secretly
as
he
could
to
meet
one
david
ferrier
a
country
gentleman
who
had
joined
the
regiment
of
six
hundred
men
raised
by
lord
ogilvie
and
had
been
made
of
brechin
for
the
prince
ferrier
also
was
a
man
well
calculated
to
serve
the
cause
he
owned
a
small
property
and
a
farm
not
far
from
the
village
of
edzell
situated
at
the
foot
of
a
glen
running
up
into
the
grampians
and
his
perfect
knowledge
of
the
country
and
its
inhabitants
of
all
degrees
gave
him
an
insight
into
every
turn
of
feeling
that
swept
through
it
in
those
troubled
days
the
business
of
his
farm
had
brought
him
continually
into
both
brechin
and
montrose
and
the
shepherds
travelling
incessantly
with
their
flocks
from
hill
to
strath
formed
one
of
his
many
chains
of
intelligence
he
had
joined
lord
ogilvie
a
couple
of
months
earlier
and
though
he
was
now
stationed
at
brechin
with
a
hundred
men
of
his
corps
he
would
absent
himself
for
a
night
at
a
time
staying
quietly
at
montrose
in
the
house
of
a
former
dependent
of
his
own
that
he
might
keep
an
eye
upon
the
movements
of
an
english
ship
the
government
had
come
into
the
harbour
carrying
sixteen
guns
and
about
eighty
men
and
had
anchored
south
of
the
town
in
the
strait
made
by
the
passage
of
the
river
esk
into
the
sea
montrose
apparently
was
to
suffer
for
the
work
she
had
done
as
a
port
for
stuart
supplies
for
the
lying
at
a
convenient
distance
just
under
the
fishing
village
of
ferryden
had
fired
heavily
on
the
town
though
no
jacobite
troops
were
there
the
commander
had
unrigged
the
shipping
and
burned
two
trading
barques
whose
owners
were
townsmen
and
he
had
landed
a
force
at
the
fort
which
had
captured
the
town
guns
and
had
carried
them
on
board
a
vessel
lying
at
the
quay
ferrier
looked
with
complete
trust
to
james
logie
and
his
brother
balnillo
the
old
man
during
his
judicial
career
had
made
some
parade
of
keeping
himself
aloof
from
politics
and
as
his
retirement
had
taken
place
previous
to
the
landing
of
the
prince
he
had
sunk
the
public
servant
in
the
country
gentleman
before
the
world
of
politicians
began
to
divide
the
sheep
from
the
goats
for
some
time
few
troubled
their
heads
about
the
peaceable
and
cautious
old
lord
of
session
whose
inconspicuous
talents
were
vegetating
among
the
trees
and
that
the
late
lady
balnillo
had
husbanded
so
carefully
for
him
as
to
his
very
much
younger
brother
who
had
been
incessantly
absent
from
his
native
land
his
existence
was
practically
forgotten
but
because
the
government
secret
intelligence
department
on
the
east
coast
had
remembered
it
at
last
with
some
suspicion
flemington
had
been
sent
to
montrose
with
directions
to
send
his
reports
to
its
agent
in
perth
and
flemington
had
bettered
his
orders
in
landing
himself
at
balnillo
as
archie
heard
a
steady
tread
approaching
he
shrank
farther
back
under
the
stair
he
could
only
distinguish
a
male
figure
which
might
belong
to
anyone
and
he
followed
it
with
straining
eyes
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
lamp
here
it
paused
and
skirting
the
light
patch
stepped
out
into
the
middle
of
the
way
he
scarcely
breathed
he
was
not
sure
yet
though
the
man
had
come
nearer
by
half
the
street
but
the
height
matched
his
expectation
and
the
avoidance
of
the
solitary
light
proved
the
desire
for
secrecy
in
the
person
before
him
as
the
man
moved
on
he
slipped
from
his
shelter
and
followed
him
keeping
just
enough
distance
between
them
to
allow
him
to
see
the
way
he
went
the
two
figures
passed
up
the
high
street
one
behind
the
other
flemington
shrinking
close
to
the
walls
and
drawing
a
little
nearer
before
they
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
his
unconscious
guide
turned
suddenly
into
one
of
those
narrow
alleys
or
closes
as
they
are
called
which
started
at
right
angles
from
the
main
street
archie
dived
in
after
him
as
unconcernedly
as
he
would
have
dived
into
the
mouth
of
hell
had
his
interests
taken
him
that
way
these
closes
characteristic
of
scottish
towns
to
this
day
were
so
long
and
burrowed
under
so
many
windows
and
doors
to
emerge
in
unexpected
places
that
he
admired
james
knowledge
of
the
short
cuts
of
montrose
though
it
seemed
to
him
no
more
than
natural
the
place
for
which
he
conceived
him
to
be
making
was
a
house
in
the
new
wynd
nicknamed
the
land
and
kept
by
a
widow
for
purposes
which
made
its
insignificance
an
advantage
it
was
used
as
he
had
heard
by
the
jacobite
community
because
the
frequent
visitors
who
entered
after
dusk
passed
in
without
more
comment
from
the
townspeople
than
could
be
expressed
in
a
lifted
eyebrow
or
a
sly
nudge
it
was
a
disconcerting
moment
even
to
him
when
the
man
in
front
of
him
stopped
and
what
he
had
taken
for
the
distant
glimmer
of
an
open
space
revealed
itself
as
a
patch
of
whitewash
with
a
door
in
it
the
close
was
a
flemington
stood
motionless
as
the
other
knocked
at
the
door
flight
was
undesirable
for
james
might
give
chase
and
capture
would
mean
the
end
of
a
piece
of
work
of
which
he
was
justly
proud
he
guessed
himself
to
be
the
of
the
two
but
he
knew
nothing
of
the
town
byways
and
other
besides
logie
might
join
in
but
his
bold
wit
did
not
desert
him
for
he
gave
a
loud
drunken
shout
as
like
those
he
had
heard
at
the
north
port
as
he
could
make
it
and
lurched
across
the
close
its
other
inmate
turned
towards
him
and
as
he
did
so
archie
shouted
again
and
stumbling
against
him
subsided
upon
the
paved
floor
the
door
beyond
them
opened
a
little
showing
a
portion
of
a
scared
face
and
a
hand
which
held
a
light
guid
sakes
what
be
wrang
inquired
a
tremulous
female
voice
the
man
was
standing
over
archie
pushing
him
with
his
foot
his
answer
may
have
reassured
the
questioner
but
it
had
a
different
effect
upon
the
heap
on
the
ground
hoot
woman
do
be
a
fool
it
me
ferrier
chapter
v
the
happy
land
the
door
opened
a
little
further
here
said
ferrier
to
the
woman
go
up
and
bring
me
the
roll
of
unwritten
paper
from
the
table
you
no
be
coming
in
not
now
maybe
in
another
hour
or
more
but
wha
yon
said
she
lord
woman
have
you
lived
all
these
years
in
montrose
and
never
seen
a
drunken
man
exclaimed
he
impatiently
shut
the
door
telling
you
and
get
what
i
want
he
will
not
trouble
you
he
past
troubling
anybody
she
obeyed
and
archie
heard
a
bolt
shot
on
the
inside
though
he
had
been
startled
on
discovering
his
mistake
he
now
felt
comforted
by
it
for
being
unknown
to
ferrier
he
was
much
safer
with
him
than
he
would
have
been
with
james
he
raised
his
head
and
tried
to
get
an
idea
of
his
companion
face
but
the
darkness
of
the
close
was
too
great
to
let
him
distinguish
his
features
he
had
discovered
where
he
lived
by
accident
but
though
a
description
of
the
man
was
in
the
little
box
now
reposing
on
the
tester
of
his
bed
at
balnillo
he
did
not
know
him
by
sight
these
things
were
going
through
his
mind
as
the
woman
returned
from
her
lodger
errand
and
the
door
had
just
been
made
fast
again
when
there
was
a
step
at
the
close
mouth
and
another
man
came
quickly
in
stopping
short
as
he
found
it
occupied
ferrier
coughed
ferrier
said
james
voice
softly
what
is
this
he
asked
as
his
foot
came
in
contact
with
archie
it
a
drunken
brute
who
came
roaring
in
here
a
minute
syne
and
fell
head
over
heels
at
my
door
replied
the
other
the
town
is
full
of
them
he
stooped
down
and
took
flemington
by
the
shoulder
up
you
get
he
cried
shaking
him
archie
breathed
heavily
and
let
his
whole
weight
hang
on
hand
haud
awa
frae
me
lassie
he
expostulated
thickly
logie
laughed
he
must
be
far
gone
indeed
to
take
you
for
a
lass
he
observed
ferrier
gave
archie
a
stronger
shake
a
no
gang
hame
wantin
annie
continued
flemington
whose
humour
was
beginning
to
find
some
pleasure
in
the
situation
the
raw
vernacular
that
he
had
mastered
with
absolute
success
in
childhood
was
at
his
tongue
end
still
come
come
said
james
ferrier
moved
forward
but
archie
had
reached
out
a
limp
hand
and
taken
him
by
the
ankle
annie
he
muttered
ma
bonnie
bonnie
annie
ferrier
who
had
nearly
fallen
forward
tried
to
strike
out
with
his
foot
but
archie
grip
nerveless
yet
clinging
as
a
limpet
held
him
fast
a
tell
ye
a
nae
gang
hame
wantin
annie
he
repeated
more
loudly
he
has
me
by
the
foot
damn
him
said
ferrier
james
swore
quietly
but
distinctly
annie
roared
archie
making
the
silent
close
echo
again
great
heavens
exclaimed
the
exasperated
james
we
shall
have
the
whole
town
out
of
bed
if
this
goes
on
shake
him
off
man
and
let
us
be
going
he
bent
down
as
he
spoke
and
groping
in
the
darkness
found
flemington
heels
he
seized
them
and
began
to
drag
him
backwards
as
a
man
drags
a
fighting
dog
he
had
a
grip
of
iron
the
effect
of
the
sudden
pull
on
ferrier
was
to
make
him
lose
his
balance
he
staggered
against
the
side
of
the
close
calling
to
logie
to
desist
archie
still
held
on
with
tenacity
but
as
the
scrape
of
flint
and
steel
cut
the
darkness
he
knew
that
he
had
carried
his
superfluous
pleasantries
too
far
he
dared
not
loose
ferrier
ankle
and
roll
to
the
wall
lest
the
action
should
prove
him
to
be
more
wideawake
and
less
intoxicated
than
he
seemed
he
could
only
bury
his
face
in
his
sleeve
his
next
sensation
was
a
violent
stab
of
burning
pain
in
his
wrist
that
made
him
draw
it
back
with
a
groan
i
knew
that
would
mend
matters
said
james
grimly
as
he
blew
out
the
tiny
twist
of
ignited
tow
and
replaced
it
and
the
steel
box
in
his
pocket
come
away
this
sot
has
wasted
our
time
long
enough
he
can
sleep
off
his
liquor
as
well
here
as
anywhere
else
you
helped
to
sober
him
said
ferrier
as
the
two
men
went
out
of
the
close
flemington
sat
up
the
burn
stung
him
dreadfully
for
the
saltpetre
in
which
the
tow
had
been
dipped
added
to
the
smart
but
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
so
he
rose
and
followed
again
ferrier
and
logie
went
off
up
the
high
street
and
turned
down
an
offshoot
of
it
which
archie
guessed
to
be
the
new
wynd
because
it
answered
to
its
position
in
his
map
of
the
town
he
dashed
to
the
corner
and
watched
them
by
the
one
light
which
illuminated
the
narrow
street
till
he
could
see
them
no
longer
then
he
flitted
after
them
a
shadow
and
withdrew
under
a
friendly
as
he
had
done
at
the
north
port
a
little
farther
on
he
could
distinguish
the
two
ascending
an
outside
stair
to
a
squat
building
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
their
knuckles
on
wood
another
minute
and
they
were
admitted
the
two
captains
were
let
into
a
small
room
in
the
back
premises
of
happy
land
by
a
woman
who
disappeared
when
she
had
given
them
a
light
pens
and
ink
lay
upon
the
table
and
the
smoke
of
lamps
had
blackened
the
ceiling
it
was
a
wretched
place
and
the
sound
of
rough
voices
came
now
and
again
from
other
parts
of
the
house
james
drew
up
a
chair
and
ferrier
also
sat
down
tossing
the
roll
of
paper
to
his
companion
a
young
man
called
flemington
is
at
balnillo
painting
my
portrait
said
logie
it
a
pity
that
i
have
not
something
of
his
gift
for
drawing
flemington
said
the
other
there
is
a
widow
flemington
who
lives
a
mile
or
so
this
side
of
the
perthshire
border
but
that
is
the
only
part
of
the
country
i
do
not
know
this
is
her
grandson
she
lived
at
germain
and
her
husband
was
with
king
james
he
is
a
strange
lad
a
fine
lad
too
my
brother
seems
mightily
taken
up
with
him
where
is
your
plan
asked
ferrier
james
took
out
a
small
and
laid
it
on
the
table
then
he
smoothed
out
the
roll
of
paper
drew
the
points
of
the
compass
on
it
and
began
to
copy
from
the
rough
sketches
and
signs
which
covered
the
leaf
of
his
little
book
ferrier
watched
him
in
silence
i
could
not
do
that
were
it
to
save
my
life
he
said
at
last
i
learned
something
campaigning
by
the
walls
of
dantzig
replied
james
ferrier
watched
the
growing
of
the
hasty
map
with
admiration
his
own
talents
for
organization
and
tactics
had
given
this
obscure
landowner
the
position
he
held
in
the
prince
haphazard
army
but
the
professional
soldier
was
invaluable
to
him
he
sat
wondering
how
he
could
have
got
on
without
james
see
said
logie
pushing
the
paper
to
him
here
lies
the
off
ferryden
at
the
south
side
of
the
river
and
here
is
inchbrayock
island
that
english
captain
is
a
fool
or
he
would
have
landed
some
men
there
you
and
i
will
land
on
it
ferrier
and
now
he
went
on
the
man
is
twice
a
fool
for
though
he
has
taken
the
guns
from
the
fort
and
put
them
on
board
one
of
the
unrigged
ships
he
has
left
her
beside
the
quay
this
point
that
i
have
marked
with
a
cross
is
where
she
is
moored
it
would
be
idle
not
to
make
use
of
such
folly
why
man
if
we
can
carry
through
the
work
i
have
in
my
mind
we
shall
blow
the
out
of
the
water
three
nights
i
have
skulked
round
the
harbour
and
now
i
think
that
every
close
and
every
kennel
that
opens
its
mouth
upon
it
is
in
my
head
and
the
island
is
the
key
to
everything
logie
eyes
shone
in
the
dim
room
like
the
eyes
of
some
animal
watching
in
a
cave
we
must
get
possession
of
the
ship
at
the
continued
he
then
we
will
take
a
couple
of
the
town
guns
and
land
them
on
inchbrayock
a
hundred
men
from
brechin
should
be
sufficient
it
must
be
done
at
night
said
the
other
at
night
said
james
getting
up
and
putting
his
hands
on
the
back
of
his
chair
and
now
as
soon
as
possible
we
must
go
down
to
the
harbour
and
look
carefully
at
the
position
of
everything
ferrier
stood
up
and
stretched
himself
as
men
so
often
will
when
they
are
turning
over
some
unacknowledged
intention
james
took
up
the
roll
of
paper
glanced
at
it
and
threw
it
down
again
i
see
it
as
though
it
had
come
by
inspiration
he
cried
i
see
that
we
have
a
blockhead
to
deal
with
and
when
heaven
sends
such
an
advantage
to
his
highness
it
is
not
you
nor
i
ferrier
who
will
balk
its
design
you
will
not
hang
back
he
looked
at
his
friend
as
though
he
were
ready
to
spring
at
him
but
ferrier
went
on
with
his
own
train
of
thought
he
was
a
slower
man
than
logie
but
if
he
lacked
his
fire
he
lacked
none
of
his
resolution
you
are
right
he
said
a
man
is
a
fool
who
leaves
what
he
has
captured
on
the
farther
side
of
the
river
who
thinks
having
taken
his
enemy
guns
from
a
fort
that
he
can
let
it
stand
empty
he
has
done
these
follies
because
he
knows
that
there
are
no
troops
in
montrose
ay
but
there
are
troops
in
brechin
burst
out
james
there
are
troops
in
brechin
repeated
ferrier
slowly
and
they
must
be
got
quietly
into
the
town
i
wish
there
were
not
eight
miles
of
road
between
the
two
i
have
not
forgotten
that
said
james
and
i
mean
to
remain
here
till
daylight
and
then
return
home
by
the
side
of
the
basin
i
will
make
my
way
along
its
shore
and
judge
whether
it
be
possible
for
you
to
bring
your
men
by
that
route
if
you
can
get
them
out
of
brechin
by
the
and
so
on
along
the
side
of
the
esk
you
will
avoid
the
road
and
i
will
be
waiting
for
you
at
the
fort
logie
had
come
round
the
little
table
and
stood
by
his
friend
waiting
for
him
to
speak
i
will
go
with
you
said
ferrier
we
can
part
below
balnillo
and
i
too
will
go
back
to
brechin
by
the
river
i
must
know
every
step
before
i
attempt
to
bring
them
in
the
dark
there
must
be
no
delays
when
the
time
comes
james
drew
a
long
sigh
of
relief
he
had
never
doubted
his
zeal
but
his
heart
had
been
on
fire
with
the
project
he
carried
in
it
and
ferrier
complete
acceptance
of
it
was
balm
to
his
spirit
he
was
a
man
who
spared
himself
nothing
mentally
or
physically
he
folded
the
roll
of
paper
and
gave
it
to
ferrier
keep
it
said
he
now
we
must
go
to
the
harbour
chapter
vi
in
darkness
and
in
light
when
the
men
had
disappeared
into
the
house
archie
remained
under
his
stairhead
considering
he
had
been
told
in
his
instructions
to
discover
two
things
whether
logie
was
in
touch
with
ferrier
and
whether
happy
land
was
frequented
by
the
pair
though
ferrier
was
in
command
of
the
small
jacobite
force
in
brechin
it
was
suspected
that
he
spent
an
unknown
quantity
of
his
time
in
montrose
to
the
first
of
these
questions
he
had
already
mastered
the
answer
it
only
remained
for
him
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
the
house
in
front
of
him
was
happy
land
he
could
not
swear
that
he
was
in
the
new
wynd
though
he
was
morally
certain
of
it
but
there
were
marks
upon
the
house
which
would
be
proof
of
its
identity
there
would
be
a
little
hole
covered
by
an
inside
sliding
panel
in
the
door
of
happy
land
through
which
its
inmates
could
see
anyone
who
ascended
the
stair
without
being
seen
themselves
and
there
would
be
the
remains
of
an
ancient
or
at
one
side
of
it
archie
ran
lightly
across
the
street
crept
up
the
staircase
and
passed
his
palm
over
the
wood
yes
there
was
the
hole
two
inches
deep
in
the
solid
door
he
put
in
his
finger
and
felt
the
panel
in
the
farther
side
then
he
searched
along
the
wall
till
his
hand
came
in
contact
with
the
jagged
edge
of
the
ancient
risp
there
was
no
ring
on
it
for
it
had
long
been
disused
but
it
hung
there
still
a
useless
and
maimed
veteran
put
out
of
action
he
returned
to
his
post
satisfied
his
discoveries
had
earned
him
the
right
to
go
home
but
he
did
not
mean
to
do
so
how
he
was
going
to
get
back
into
balnillo
house
unseen
he
did
not
know
and
had
not
so
far
troubled
himself
to
imagine
perhaps
he
might
have
to
stop
out
all
night
he
hoped
not
but
he
was
not
going
to
meet
trouble
the
house
would
be
locked
the
household
with
the
exception
of
the
errant
james
abed
and
his
own
room
was
not
upon
the
however
these
were
matters
for
later
consideration
and
he
would
remain
where
he
was
for
a
time
for
all
he
knew
ferrier
and
logie
might
combine
business
with
pleasure
by
staying
in
happy
land
till
morning
but
they
were
just
as
likely
to
come
out
within
measurable
time
and
then
he
could
see
where
they
went
he
was
quite
happy
as
he
was
everywhere
he
fell
to
thinking
of
other
things
of
his
host
with
his
thin
neat
legs
and
velvet
coat
of
that
the
circuit
upon
which
the
old
man
valued
himself
so
much
in
his
mind
eye
he
figured
him
astride
of
his
floundering
nag
at
the
edge
of
some
uninviting
bog
in
an
access
of
precise
dismay
that
was
how
he
would
have
wished
to
paint
him
his
powers
of
detachment
were
such
that
he
became
fascinated
by
the
idea
and
awoke
from
it
with
a
start
to
hear
the
footsteps
of
logie
and
ferrier
coming
down
the
stairway
opposite
they
did
not
retrace
their
way
up
the
wynd
but
went
on
to
its
end
and
turned
into
a
street
leading
southwards
whilst
archie
slipped
along
in
their
wake
at
last
they
reached
a
wilderness
of
sheds
and
lumber
above
which
stood
a
windmill
on
a
little
eminence
and
the
strong
smell
of
sea
and
tar
proclaimed
the
region
of
the
harbour
a
light
shone
clear
and
large
across
the
dark
space
of
water
touching
the
moving
ripples
and
this
archie
guessed
to
be
the
of
the
which
lay
like
a
sullen
under
ferryden
village
he
had
to
go
very
warily
for
the
pair
in
front
stopped
often
and
stood
talking
in
low
voices
but
the
bales
and
coils
of
rope
and
heaps
of
timber
with
which
the
quays
were
strewn
gave
him
cover
he
could
not
get
close
enough
to
them
to
hear
what
they
said
but
their
figures
were
much
plainer
against
the
background
of
water
than
they
had
been
in
the
streets
and
he
noted
how
often
logie
would
stretch
out
his
arm
pointing
to
the
solitary
light
across
the
strait
there
was
scarcely
any
illumination
on
this
side
of
it
and
the
unrigged
shipping
lay
in
darkness
as
ferrier
and
his
friend
went
along
the
quay
and
seated
themselves
on
a
windlass
archie
drawing
closer
could
hear
the
rustle
as
the
former
unrolled
james
map
the
soldier
took
out
his
flint
and
steel
and
struck
a
light
covering
it
with
his
hand
and
both
men
bent
their
heads
over
the
paper
archie
wrist
smarted
afresh
as
he
saw
it
his
sleeve
had
rubbed
the
burn
and
he
could
feel
the
oozing
blood
he
crouched
behind
them
peering
through
the
medley
of
ropes
and
tackle
which
hung
on
the
windlass
by
standing
up
he
could
have
touched
the
two
men
he
had
no
idea
what
it
was
that
they
were
studying
but
his
sharp
wits
told
him
that
it
must
be
a
map
of
some
kind
something
which
might
concern
the
english
ship
across
the
waterway
he
longed
to
get
it
his
confidence
in
his
own
luck
was
one
of
the
qualities
that
had
served
him
best
and
his
confidence
in
his
own
speed
was
great
and
moreover
he
knew
that
he
had
twelve
years
of
advantage
over
james
and
from
the
sound
of
voice
he
judged
that
he
had
the
same
or
more
over
him
the
temptation
of
chance
overmastered
him
he
raised
himself
noiselessly
leaned
over
the
intervening
tackle
and
made
a
bold
snatch
at
the
map
which
ferrier
held
whilst
james
was
occupied
with
the
lighted
twist
of
tow
but
his
luck
was
to
fail
him
this
time
logie
moved
his
hand
knocking
it
against
flemington
and
the
light
caught
the
paper
edge
a
soft
puff
of
was
coming
in
from
over
the
strait
and
in
one
moment
the
sheet
was
ablaze
archie
snatched
back
his
hand
and
fled
but
the
glare
of
the
burning
paper
had
been
bright
enough
to
show
logie
a
man
wrist
on
which
there
was
a
fresh
bleeding
mark
the
bright
flare
of
the
paper
only
intensified
the
darkness
for
the
two
astounded
men
and
though
each
was
instantly
on
his
feet
and
running
in
the
direction
of
the
retreating
footsteps
archie
had
threaded
the
maze
of
amphibious
obstacles
and
was
plunging
between
the
sheds
into
the
street
before
either
of
them
could
get
clear
of
the
pitfalls
of
the
quay
he
tore
on
not
knowing
whither
he
went
his
start
had
been
a
good
one
but
as
he
paused
to
listen
which
he
did
when
he
had
gone
some
way
he
could
hear
them
following
the
town
was
so
quiet
that
he
met
nobody
and
he
pressed
on
trusting
to
luck
for
his
direction
through
the
empty
streets
he
went
at
the
top
of
his
speed
launched
on
the
flood
of
chance
and
steering
as
best
he
could
for
the
north
end
of
the
town
finally
an
unexpected
turning
brought
him
within
a
few
yards
of
the
north
port
he
waited
close
to
the
spot
where
he
had
first
taken
shelter
and
listened
then
hearing
nothing
he
struck
out
at
a
brisk
walk
for
the
country
and
was
soon
clear
of
montrose
he
sat
down
by
the
wayside
to
rest
he
had
had
a
more
sensational
night
than
he
expected
and
though
his
spirits
were
still
good
his
in
missing
the
paper
he
had
risked
so
much
to
obtain
had
cooled
them
a
little
and
by
the
light
of
this
disappointment
he
looked
rather
ruefully
on
his
poor
prospects
of
getting
to
bed
it
was
past
midnight
and
there
seemed
nothing
to
do
but
to
return
to
balnillo
and
to
make
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
could
in
one
of
the
many
which
the
yard
by
its
contained
the
household
rose
early
and
at
the
unlocking
of
that
door
he
must
manage
to
slip
in
and
gain
his
bedroom
he
rose
plodded
home
and
stole
into
the
courtyard
where
searching
in
an
outhouse
he
found
an
endurable
couch
on
a
heap
of
straw
on
this
he
spread
his
coat
like
a
blanket
crawling
under
it
and
with
a
calmness
born
of
perfect
health
and
perfect
nerves
was
soon
asleep
when
dawn
broke
it
found
him
wakeful
he
had
not
rested
well
for
his
burnt
wrist
was
very
sore
and
the
straw
seemed
to
find
it
out
and
to
prick
the
wound
no
matter
how
he
might
dispose
his
hand
he
propped
himself
against
the
wall
by
the
open
whence
he
could
see
the
back
door
of
balnillo
and
watch
for
the
moment
of
its
first
opening
it
would
be
neck
or
nothing
then
for
he
must
enter
boldly
trusting
to
hit
on
a
lucky
moment
at
last
the
growing
light
began
to
define
details
of
the
house
tracing
them
out
on
its
great
mass
with
an
invisible
pencil
and
he
thought
he
heard
a
movement
within
the
struck
six
and
high
above
he
could
see
the
sun
touching
the
slates
and
the
stone
angles
of
the
with
the
first
fresh
ethereal
beam
of
a
pure
october
morning
he
inhaled
its
breath
lovingly
and
with
it
there
fell
from
him
the
heaviness
of
his
uneasy
night
all
was
well
he
told
himself
his
sensuous
joy
in
the
world
his
love
of
life
and
its
hazards
and
energies
came
back
upon
him
strong
clean
and
ecstatic
and
the
sounds
of
a
bolt
withdrawn
made
him
rise
to
his
feet
a
maidservant
came
out
carrying
a
lantern
whose
beam
burned
with
feeble
pretentiousness
in
the
coming
sunlight
she
set
it
down
by
the
threshold
and
went
past
his
retreat
to
the
stable
no
doubt
she
was
going
to
call
the
men
when
she
had
gone
by
he
slipped
out
and
in
a
dozen
paces
was
inside
the
house
another
minute
and
he
was
in
his
room
he
looked
with
some
amusement
at
the
rough
effigy
of
himself
which
he
had
made
in
the
bed
overnight
and
when
he
had
flung
the
cushion
back
to
its
place
he
got
out
of
his
clothes
and
lay
down
sinking
into
the
cool
luxury
of
the
sheets
with
a
sigh
of
pleasure
but
he
had
no
desire
to
sleep
and
when
a
servant
came
to
wake
him
half
an
hour
later
he
was
ready
to
get
up
he
rose
dressed
wrote
out
the
detailed
description
of
his
night
discoveries
and
put
the
document
in
his
pocket
to
await
its
chance
of
transmission
a
message
was
brought
to
him
from
lord
balnillo
as
he
left
his
room
which
begged
his
guest
to
excuse
his
company
at
breakfast
he
had
been
long
astir
and
busy
with
his
correspondence
at
eleven
he
would
be
ready
for
his
sitting
if
that
were
agreeable
to
flemington
as
flemington
realized
how
easily
he
might
have
met
the
judge
as
he
ran
through
the
shuttered
passage
his
belief
in
the
luck
that
had
used
him
so
scurvily
last
night
returned
there
was
no
sign
of
james
as
archie
sat
down
to
his
meal
though
a
second
place
was
set
at
the
table
and
as
he
did
not
want
to
ask
embarrassing
questions
he
made
no
inquiry
about
him
besides
which
being
immoderately
hungry
he
was
too
well
occupied
to
trouble
about
anyone
he
went
out
upon
the
terrace
when
he
had
finished
the
warm
greyness
of
the
autumn
morning
was
lifting
from
the
earth
and
it
was
still
early
enough
for
long
shadows
to
lie
cool
on
the
westward
side
of
the
timber
as
they
shortened
the
crystal
of
the
dew
was
catching
shafts
from
the
sun
and
the
parks
seemed
to
lie
waiting
till
the
energy
of
the
young
day
should
let
loose
the
forces
of
life
from
under
the
mystery
of
its
spangled
veil
where
the
glowed
carmine
and
orange
touches
of
quickening
fire
shot
through
the
interstices
of
their
branches
and
coloured
like
a
tress
of
trailing
the
south
esk
wound
into
the
basin
of
montrose
where
the
tide
ebbing
beyond
the
town
was
leaving
its
wet
sands
as
a
for
all
sorts
of
roving
birds
whose
crying
voices
came
faintly
to
archie
mellowed
by
distance
truly
this
was
a
fascinating
place
with
its
changing
element
of
distant
water
its
great
plain
lines
of
pasture
its
ordered
vistas
of
foliage
the
passion
for
beauty
lay
deep
below
the
tossing
driving
impulses
of
flemington
nature
and
it
rose
up
now
as
he
stood
on
the
terraces
of
balnillo
and
gazed
before
him
for
the
moment
everything
in
his
mind
was
swallowed
up
but
the
abstract
fundamental
desire
for
perfection
which
is
when
all
is
said
and
done
mainspring
its
incessant
though
often
erring
guide
whose
perverted
behests
we
call
sin
whose
legitimate
ones
we
call
virtue
whose
very
existence
is
a
guarantee
of
immortality
the
world
this
crystalline
morning
was
so
beautiful
to
archie
that
he
ached
with
the
uncomprehended
longing
to
identify
himself
with
perfection
to
cast
his
body
down
upon
the
earth
and
to
be
one
with
it
to
fling
his
soul
into
the
heights
and
depths
of
the
limitless
encompassing
ether
to
be
drawn
into
the
heart
of
material
manifestation
on
earth
the
sun
he
understood
nothing
of
what
he
felt
neither
the
discomfort
of
his
imprisonment
of
flesh
nor
the
rapturous
tentative
of
the
spirit
within
it
he
left
the
garden
terrace
and
went
off
towards
the
basin
with
the
touch
of
that
elemental
flood
of
truth
into
which
he
had
been
plunged
for
a
moment
fresh
on
his
soul
the
whole
universe
and
its
contents
seemed
to
him
good
and
not
only
good
but
of
consummate
interest
humanity
was
fascinating
his
failure
to
snatch
the
map
from
ferrier
hand
last
night
only
made
him
smile
in
the
perfection
of
this
transcendent
creation
all
was
and
must
be
well
his
thoughts
woven
of
the
same
radiant
appreciation
flew
to
james
whose
personality
appealed
to
him
so
strongly
the
gentle
blood
which
ran
in
the
veins
of
the
pair
of
brothers
ran
closer
to
the
surface
in
the
younger
one
and
a
steadfast
unostentatious
gallantry
of
heart
seemed
to
be
the
atmosphere
in
which
he
breathed
he
was
one
of
those
whose
presence
in
a
room
would
always
be
the
strongest
force
in
it
whether
he
spoke
or
was
silent
and
his
voice
had
the
tone
of
something
sounding
over
great
and
hidden
depths
it
was
not
necessary
to
talk
to
him
to
know
that
he
had
lived
a
life
of
vicissitude
and
archie
all
unsuspected
in
the
watches
of
last
night
had
seen
a
side
of
him
which
did
not
show
at
balnillo
his
grim
resourcefulness
in
small
things
was
illustrated
by
the
raw
spot
on
the
young
man
wrist
that
episode
pleased
flemington
imagination
though
it
might
have
pleased
him
even
better
had
the
victim
been
someone
else
but
he
bore
james
no
malice
for
it
and
the
picture
of
the
man
haunting
the
dark
quays
strewn
with
romantic
lumber
and
scheming
for
the
cause
at
his
heart
whilst
the
light
from
the
hostile
ship
trailed
the
water
beside
him
charmed
his
active
fancy
but
it
was
not
only
his
fancy
that
was
at
work
he
knew
that
the
compelling
atmosphere
of
logie
had
not
been
created
by
mere
fancy
because
there
was
something
larger
than
himself
and
larger
than
anything
he
could
understand
about
the
soldier
and
feeling
as
he
was
apt
to
do
every
little
change
in
the
mental
climate
surrounding
him
he
had
guessed
that
logie
liked
him
the
thought
added
to
the
exultation
produced
in
him
by
the
glory
of
the
pure
morning
and
he
suddenly
fell
from
his
height
as
he
remembered
afresh
that
he
was
here
to
cheat
him
it
was
with
a
shock
that
he
heard
skirling
wattie
pipes
as
he
reached
the
montrose
road
and
saw
the
beggar
outlandish
cart
approaching
evidently
on
its
return
journey
to
montrose
his
heart
beat
against
the
report
that
lay
in
his
pocket
awaiting
the
opportunity
that
fate
was
bringing
nearer
every
moment
there
was
nobody
to
be
seen
as
the
beggar
drew
up
beside
him
the
insolent
joviality
that
pervaded
the
man
his
almost
indecent
oddness
things
which
had
pleased
archie
yesterday
struck
cold
on
him
now
he
had
no
wish
to
stay
talking
to
him
and
he
gave
him
the
paper
without
a
word
more
than
the
injunction
to
have
it
despatched
he
left
him
hurrying
across
the
montrose
road
and
making
for
the
place
where
the
ground
began
to
fall
away
to
the
basin
he
sat
down
on
the
scrubby
waste
land
by
a
whose
dry
burst
pods
hung
like
tattered
black
flags
in
the
brush
of
green
their
acrid
smell
was
coming
out
as
the
sun
mounted
higher
below
him
the
marshy
ground
ran
out
to
meet
the
water
and
eastward
the
uncovered
mud
and
wet
sand
bared
by
the
tide
ebbing
beyond
montrose
stretched
along
its
shores
to
the
town
the
fall
of
the
bank
was
steep
enough
to
hide
anyone
coming
up
from
the
lower
levels
and
he
listened
to
the
movements
of
somebody
who
was
approaching
and
to
the
crackling
noise
of
the
bushes
as
they
were
thrust
apart
the
sound
stopped
and
archie
leaning
forward
saw
james
standing
up
the
ascent
with
his
back
turned
towards
him
looking
out
across
the
flats
he
knew
what
his
thoughts
were
he
drew
his
right
sleeve
lower
so
long
as
he
did
not
stretch
out
his
arm
the
mark
could
not
be
seen
he
did
not
want
to
appear
as
if
he
were
watching
logie
so
he
made
a
slight
sound
and
the
other
turned
quickly
and
faced
him
hidden
from
the
waist
downwards
in
the
broom
then
his
crooked
lip
moved
and
he
came
up
the
bank
and
threw
himself
down
beside
flemington
chapter
vii
treachery
james
did
not
look
as
if
he
had
been
up
all
night
though
he
had
spent
the
most
part
of
it
on
foot
with
ferrier
the
refreshment
of
morning
had
bathed
him
too
but
he
was
still
harassed
in
mind
by
some
of
the
occurrences
of
the
last
few
hours
last
night
he
had
seen
the
mark
on
the
wrist
stretched
suddenly
between
himself
and
his
friend
and
had
understood
its
significance
it
was
the
mark
that
he
had
put
there
as
the
two
men
listened
to
the
flying
footsteps
that
mystified
them
by
their
doublings
in
the
darkness
it
had
dawned
upon
them
that
the
intruder
skulking
behind
the
windlass
and
the
tipsy
reveller
prone
in
the
close
were
one
and
the
same
person
the
drunkard
was
a
very
daring
spy
as
sober
as
themselves
you
are
out
betimes
said
archie
with
friendly
innocence
i
often
am
replied
james
simply
archie
pulled
up
a
blade
of
grass
and
began
to
chew
it
meditatively
i
see
your
long
night
has
done
you
good
began
logie
there
were
many
things
i
should
have
liked
to
ask
you
yesterday
evening
but
you
went
away
so
early
that
i
could
not
silence
dropped
upon
the
two
upon
logie
because
his
manner
last
night
had
hinted
at
remembrances
buried
in
regret
and
painful
to
dig
up
on
flemington
because
he
knew
the
value
of
that
impression
and
because
he
would
fain
put
off
the
moment
when
the
more
complete
deception
of
the
man
whose
sympathetic
attitude
he
divined
and
whose
generosity
of
soul
was
so
obvious
must
begin
he
did
not
want
to
come
to
close
quarters
with
james
he
had
hunted
him
and
been
hunted
by
him
but
he
had
not
yet
been
obliged
to
lie
to
him
by
word
of
mouth
and
he
had
no
desire
to
do
so
here
and
now
in
cold
blood
and
in
the
face
of
all
this
beauty
and
peace
i
could
not
but
be
interested
in
what
you
said
continued
the
other
you
did
not
tell
us
whether
you
had
been
at
germain
yourself
never
replied
archie
i
was
sent
to
scotland
at
eight
years
old
and
i
have
been
here
ever
since
he
had
taken
the
plunge
now
for
he
had
been
backwards
and
forwards
to
france
several
times
in
the
last
few
years
since
he
had
begun
to
work
for
king
george
employed
in
watching
the
movements
of
suspicious
persons
between
one
country
and
the
other
he
looked
down
on
the
ground
the
more
he
hesitated
to
speak
the
more
he
knew
that
he
would
impress
james
he
understood
the
delicacy
of
his
companion
feeling
by
instinct
it
was
not
only
dissimulation
which
bade
him
act
thus
it
was
the
real
embarrassment
and
discomfort
which
were
creeping
on
him
under
the
eyes
of
the
honourable
soldier
all
the
same
he
hoped
that
his
reluctant
silence
would
save
him
you
think
me
impertinent
said
logie
but
do
not
be
afraid
that
i
mean
to
pry
i
know
how
hard
life
can
be
and
how
anxious
nowadays
there
is
so
much
loss
and
trouble
god
knows
what
may
happen
to
this
tormented
country
but
trouble
does
not
seem
natural
when
a
man
is
young
and
as
you
are
archie
was
collecting
materials
wherewith
to
screen
himself
from
his
companion
sympathy
it
would
be
easy
to
tell
him
some
rigmarole
of
early
suffering
of
want
endured
for
the
cause
which
had
lain
dormant
yet
living
since
the
unsuccessful
rising
of
the
of
the
devotion
to
it
of
the
parents
he
had
scarcely
known
of
the
bitterness
of
their
exile
but
somehow
he
could
not
force
himself
to
do
it
he
remembered
those
parents
principally
as
vague
people
who
were
ceaselessly
playing
cards
and
whose
quarrels
had
terrified
him
when
he
was
small
his
real
interest
in
life
had
begun
when
he
arrived
at
ardguys
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
grandmother
whose
fascination
he
had
felt
in
common
with
most
other
male
creatures
he
had
had
a
joyous
youth
and
he
knew
it
he
had
run
the
pastures
climbed
the
trees
fished
the
kilpie
burn
and
known
every
country
pleasure
dear
to
boyhood
if
he
had
been
solitary
he
had
yet
been
perfectly
happy
he
had
gone
to
edinburgh
at
seventeen
at
his
own
ardent
wish
to
learn
painting
not
as
a
profession
but
as
a
pastime
his
prospects
were
comfortable
for
madam
flemington
had
made
him
her
heir
and
she
had
relations
settled
in
england
who
were
always
ready
to
bid
him
welcome
when
he
crossed
the
border
life
had
been
consistently
pleasant
and
had
grown
exciting
since
the
beginning
of
his
work
for
government
he
wished
to
heaven
he
had
not
met
james
this
morning
but
to
logie
archie
was
merely
a
youth
of
undoubted
good
breeding
struggling
bravely
for
his
bread
in
an
almost
menial
profession
and
he
honoured
him
for
what
he
deemed
his
courage
there
was
no
need
to
seek
a
reason
for
his
poverty
after
hearing
his
words
last
night
his
voice
when
he
spoke
of
his
father
death
in
exile
had
implied
all
that
was
necessary
to
establish
a
claim
on
james
generous
and
rather
bigoted
heart
for
him
there
were
only
two
kinds
of
men
those
who
were
for
the
stuarts
and
those
who
were
not
people
were
very
reticent
about
their
political
feelings
in
those
days
some
from
pure
caution
and
some
because
these
lay
so
deep
under
mountains
of
personal
loss
and
misfortune
i
dare
not
look
back
said
archie
at
last
i
have
to
live
by
my
trade
and
fight
the
world
with
my
brush
you
live
by
sticking
your
sword
into
its
entrails
and
i
by
painting
its
face
a
better
colour
than
nature
chose
for
it
and
i
think
yours
is
the
pleasanter
calling
of
the
two
but
i
am
grateful
to
mine
all
the
same
and
now
it
has
procured
me
the
acquaintance
of
his
lordship
and
the
pleasure
of
being
where
i
am
i
need
not
tell
you
that
i
find
myself
in
clover
i
am
heartily
glad
of
it
said
james
indeed
so
am
i
rejoined
archie
pleased
at
having
turned
the
conversation
so
deftly
for
you
can
not
think
what
strange
things
happen
to
a
man
who
has
no
recognized
place
in
the
minds
of
respectable
people
james
rolled
over
on
his
chest
leaning
on
his
elbows
and
looked
up
at
his
companion
sitting
just
above
him
with
his
dark
silky
head
clear
cut
against
the
background
of
green
bush
the
young
man
words
seemed
to
trip
out
and
pirouette
with
impudent
jauntiness
in
their
hearer
face
logie
did
not
know
that
archie
management
of
these
puppets
was
a
part
of
his
charm
his
detached
points
of
view
were
restful
to
a
man
like
james
one
continually
preoccupied
by
large
issues
it
was
difficult
to
think
of
responsibilities
in
presence
you
might
never
imagine
how
much
i
am
admired
below
stairs
said
the
latter
while
i
painted
a
lady
in
the
south
i
was
expected
to
eat
with
the
servants
and
the
attentions
of
a
all
but
cost
me
my
life
i
found
a
challenge
offering
me
the
choice
of
weapons
in
the
most
approved
manner
under
my
dish
of
porridge
it
came
from
a
groom
what
did
you
do
asked
james
astounded
i
chose
said
archie
and
that
ended
the
matter
james
laughed
aloud
but
there
was
bitterness
in
his
mirth
and
this
was
a
man
born
at
germain
we
laugh
said
he
but
such
a
life
could
have
been
no
laughing
matter
to
you
but
i
assure
you
it
was
what
else
could
i
do
you
could
have
left
the
place
began
james
then
he
stopped
short
remembering
that
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
his
expression
was
not
lost
on
archie
who
saw
that
the
boat
he
had
steered
so
carefully
into
the
shallows
was
drawing
out
to
deep
water
again
and
that
he
had
used
his
luxuriant
imagination
to
small
purpose
he
had
so
little
that
to
keep
interest
upon
himself
was
no
temptation
to
him
though
it
might
have
been
to
some
men
he
cast
about
for
something
wherewith
to
blot
his
own
figure
from
the
picture
and
you
he
said
gravely
you
who
think
so
much
of
my
discomforts
and
who
have
actually
wielded
the
sword
while
i
have
merely
threatened
to
wield
the
you
must
have
seen
stranger
things
than
the
kitchen
i
said
james
looking
fixedly
out
to
where
the
town
steeple
threw
its
reflection
on
the
wet
sand
yes
i
have
seen
things
that
i
hope
you
will
never
see
it
is
not
for
me
to
speak
ill
of
war
i
who
have
turned
to
it
for
consolation
as
a
man
may
turn
to
his
religion
but
war
is
not
waged
against
men
alone
in
some
countries
i
have
seen
it
when
it
is
waged
against
women
and
little
children
when
it
is
slaughter
not
war
i
have
seen
mothers
young
beautiful
women
fighting
like
wild
beasts
for
the
poor
babes
that
cowered
behind
their
skirts
and
i
have
seen
their
bodies
afterwards
it
would
be
best
to
forget
but
who
can
forget
archie
sat
still
with
eyes
from
which
all
levity
had
vanished
he
had
known
vaguely
that
james
had
fought
under
marshal
lacy
in
the
war
of
the
polish
succession
in
the
bloody
campaign
against
the
turks
and
again
in
finland
the
ironic
futility
of
things
in
general
struck
him
for
it
was
absurd
to
think
that
this
man
seared
by
war
and
wise
in
the
realities
of
events
whose
rumours
shook
europe
one
who
had
looked
upon
death
daily
in
company
with
men
like
peter
lacy
should
come
home
to
be
hunted
down
back
streets
by
a
travelling
painter
he
contemplated
his
companion
with
renewed
interest
no
wonder
he
was
ruthless
in
small
things
he
was
decidedly
the
most
fascinating
person
he
had
known
and
you
went
to
these
things
so
you
said
for
consolation
for
a
thing
that
does
not
exist
said
the
other
slowly
he
paused
and
turned
to
his
companion
with
an
expression
that
horrified
the
young
man
and
paralyzed
his
curiosity
the
power
in
his
face
seemed
to
have
given
way
revealing
for
a
moment
a
defencelessness
like
the
defencelessness
of
a
child
looking
upon
the
dark
and
it
told
archie
that
there
was
something
that
even
logie
dreaded
and
that
that
something
was
memory
the
deep
places
he
had
guessed
in
james
soul
were
deep
indeed
and
again
flemington
was
struck
with
humility
for
his
own
unimportance
in
contrast
with
this
experienced
man
seemed
little
less
than
pitiful
the
feeling
closed
his
lips
and
he
looked
round
at
the
shortening
shadows
and
into
the
stir
of
coming
sunlight
as
a
man
looks
round
for
a
door
through
which
to
escape
from
impending
stress
he
who
was
always
ready
to
go
forward
recoiled
because
of
what
he
foresaw
in
himself
his
was
ebbing
for
he
was
afraid
of
how
much
he
might
be
turned
out
of
his
way
by
the
influence
on
him
of
logie
he
wished
that
he
could
force
their
talk
into
a
different
channel
but
his
ready
wits
for
once
would
not
answer
the
call
something
not
understood
by
him
was
moving
james
to
expression
as
reserved
men
are
compelled
towards
it
at
times
perhaps
the
bygone
youth
in
him
rose
up
in
response
to
the
youth
at
his
side
the
many
years
dividing
him
from
his
brother
the
judge
had
never
consciously
troubled
him
in
their
intercourse
but
the
tremendous
divergence
in
their
respective
characters
had
thrown
him
back
upon
himself
archie
seemed
to
have
the
power
of
turning
a
key
that
balnillo
had
never
held
but
i
am
putting
you
out
of
conceit
with
the
world
cried
james
abruptly
let
no
one
do
that
take
all
you
can
flemington
i
did
i
took
it
all
love
roystering
good
company
good
wine
good
play
all
came
to
me
and
i
had
my
bellyful
there
were
merry
times
in
holland
with
the
scots
brigade
it
was
the
best
part
of
my
life
and
i
went
to
it
young
i
was
sixteen
the
day
i
stood
up
on
parade
for
the
first
time
i
have
often
had
a
mind
to
invade
holland
observed
archie
grasping
eagerly
at
the
impersonal
part
of
the
subject
it
would
be
paradise
to
one
of
my
trade
the
very
thought
of
a
windmill
weaves
a
picture
for
me
and
those
strange
striped
flowers
the
dutchmen
raise
i
can
not
think
of
their
names
now
i
would
give
much
to
see
them
growing
you
must
have
seen
them
in
every
variety
and
hue
ay
i
saw
the
tulips
said
james
in
a
strange
voice
the
dutchmen
can
paint
them
too
said
archie
hurriedly
what
devil
makes
you
talk
of
tulips
cried
james
fate
painted
the
tulips
for
me
oh
flemington
flemington
in
every
country
in
every
march
in
every
fight
among
dead
and
dying
and
among
dancers
and
the
music
they
danced
to
i
have
seen
nothing
but
those
gaudy
flowers
beds
of
them
growing
like
a
woven
carpet
and
diane
among
them
no
feminine
figure
had
come
into
the
background
against
which
stood
archie
conception
of
logie
diane
he
exclaimed
involuntarily
james
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
her
eyes
were
like
yours
he
went
on
when
i
saw
you
come
into
the
light
of
the
house
two
evenings
since
i
thought
of
her
neither
spoke
for
a
few
moments
then
james
went
on
again
fourteen
years
since
the
day
i
saw
her
last
she
looked
out
at
me
from
the
window
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
the
window
was
filled
with
flowers
she
loved
them
the
tulips
were
there
again
crimson
tulips
with
her
white
face
behind
them
flemington
listened
with
parted
lips
his
personal
feelings
his
shrinking
dread
of
being
drawn
into
the
confidence
of
the
man
whom
it
was
his
business
to
betray
were
swallowed
by
a
wave
of
interest
i
was
no
more
than
a
boy
with
my
head
full
of
cards
and
women
and
horses
and
every
devilry
under
heaven
when
i
went
to
the
house
among
the
canals
the
conte
de
montdelys
had
built
it
for
he
lived
in
holland
a
part
of
the
year
to
grow
his
tulips
he
was
a
rich
man
a
hard
old
pinched
frenchman
but
his
passion
was
and
their
cultivation
was
a
new
thing
it
was
a
great
sight
to
see
the
gardens
he
had
planned
at
the
water
edge
with
every
colour
reflected
from
the
beds
and
the
house
in
the
middle
even
the
young
men
of
the
brigade
were
glad
to
spend
an
afternoon
looking
upon
the
show
and
the
conte
would
invite
now
one
now
another
he
loved
to
strut
about
exhibiting
his
gardens
diane
was
his
daughter
my
poor
diane
flemington
do
i
weary
you
no
no
indeed
cried
archie
who
had
been
lost
wandering
in
an
enchanted
labyrinth
of
bloom
and
colour
as
he
listened
the
image
of
the
house
rising
from
among
its
waterways
was
as
vivid
to
him
as
if
he
had
seen
it
with
bodily
eyes
she
was
so
young
said
the
soldier
so
gentle
so
little
suited
to
such
as
i
but
she
loved
me
god
knows
why
and
she
was
brave
brave
to
the
end
as
she
lay
dying
by
the
roadside
and
sending
me
her
love
he
stopped
and
turned
away
archie
could
say
nothing
for
his
throat
had
grown
thick
logie
unconscious
gift
of
filling
his
words
with
drama
a
gift
which
is
most
often
given
to
those
who
suspect
it
least
wrought
on
him
james
looked
round
staring
steadily
and
blindly
over
his
shoulder
i
took
her
away
he
went
on
as
though
describing
another
experiences
there
was
no
choice
for
the
conte
would
not
tolerate
me
i
was
a
protestant
and
i
was
poor
and
there
was
a
rich
spaniard
whom
he
favoured
so
we
went
we
were
married
in
breda
and
for
a
year
we
lived
in
peace
such
days
such
days
the
conte
made
no
sign
and
i
thought
in
my
folly
he
would
let
us
alone
it
seemed
as
though
we
had
gained
paradise
at
last
but
i
did
not
know
him
montdelys
then
the
boy
was
born
when
he
was
two
months
old
i
was
obliged
to
come
back
to
scotland
it
was
a
matter
concerning
money
which
could
not
be
delayed
for
my
little
fortune
had
to
be
made
doubly
secure
now
and
i
got
leave
from
my
regiment
i
could
not
take
diane
and
the
child
and
i
left
them
at
breda
safe
as
i
thought
at
we
do
not
know
men
not
the
endless
treachery
of
them
flemington
when
god
calls
us
all
to
judgment
there
will
be
no
mercy
for
treachery
archie
eyes
fixed
on
the
other
pair
whose
keen
grey
light
was
blurred
with
pain
dropped
he
breathed
hard
and
his
nostrils
quivered
you
seem
to
me
as
young
as
i
was
then
may
god
preserve
you
from
man
treachery
he
did
not
preserve
me
said
james
i
do
not
know
how
montdelys
knew
that
she
was
defenceless
continued
he
but
i
think
there
must
have
been
some
spy
of
his
watching
us
as
soon
as
i
had
left
holland
he
sent
to
her
to
say
he
was
ill
probably
dying
and
that
he
had
forgiven
all
he
longed
for
the
sight
of
the
boy
and
he
asked
her
to
bring
him
that
he
might
see
his
grandchild
she
was
to
make
her
home
with
him
while
i
was
absent
and
he
would
send
word
to
me
to
join
them
on
my
return
diane
sent
me
the
good
news
and
went
fearing
nothing
to
find
herself
a
prisoner
and
all
this
time
he
had
been
working
he
and
the
spaniard
to
get
the
pope
to
annul
our
marriage
and
they
had
succeeded
what
they
said
to
her
what
they
did
i
know
not
and
never
shall
know
but
they
could
not
shake
diane
i
was
on
my
way
back
to
holland
when
she
managed
to
escape
with
the
boy
storms
in
the
north
sea
delayed
me
but
i
was
not
disturbed
knowing
her
to
be
safe
i
did
not
know
when
i
landed
at
last
that
she
was
dead
she
swam
the
canal
flemington
with
the
child
tied
on
her
shoulders
and
the
of
mine
a
man
in
my
own
company
whom
she
had
contrived
to
communicate
with
was
waiting
for
her
with
a
carriage
my
regiment
had
moved
to
and
he
meant
to
take
her
there
he
had
arranged
it
with
the
wife
of
my
colonel
who
was
to
give
her
shelter
till
i
arrived
and
could
protect
her
myself
they
had
gone
more
than
to
bergen
when
they
were
overtaken
early
in
the
morning
she
was
shot
flemington
the
bullet
was
meant
for
carmichael
the
man
who
was
with
her
but
it
struck
diane
they
laid
her
on
the
grass
at
the
roadside
and
she
died
holding
carmichael
hand
and
sending
sending
he
stopped
and
the
child
said
archie
at
last
carmichael
brought
him
to
bergen
with
his
mother
he
did
not
live
the
bullet
had
grazed
his
poor
little
body
as
he
lay
in
her
arms
and
the
exposure
did
the
rest
they
are
buried
at
bergen
again
archie
was
speechless
i
killed
the
spaniard
said
james
i
could
not
reach
montdelys
he
was
too
old
to
be
able
to
settle
his
differences
in
the
world
of
men
archie
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
longed
with
a
bitter
longing
to
show
his
companion
something
of
what
he
felt
to
give
him
some
sign
of
the
passion
of
sympathy
which
had
shaken
him
as
he
listened
but
his
tongue
was
tied
fast
by
the
blighting
knowledge
of
his
true
position
and
to
approach
by
so
much
as
a
step
seemed
only
to
blacken
his
soul
and
to
load
it
yet
more
heavily
with
a
treachery
as
vile
as
that
which
had
undone
james
i
could
not
endure
holland
afterwards
continued
logie
once
i
had
looked
on
that
spanish
hound
dead
body
my
work
was
done
i
left
the
scots
brigade
and
took
service
with
russia
and
i
joined
peter
lacy
who
was
on
his
way
to
fight
in
poland
fighting
was
all
i
wanted
and
god
knows
i
had
it
i
did
not
want
to
be
killed
but
to
kill
then
i
grew
weary
of
that
but
i
still
stayed
with
lacy
and
followed
him
to
fight
the
turks
we
outlive
trouble
in
time
flemington
we
outlive
it
though
we
can
not
outlive
memory
we
outlast
it
that
is
a
better
word
i
have
outlasted
perhaps
outlived
i
can
turn
and
look
back
upon
myself
as
though
i
were
another
being
it
is
only
when
some
chance
word
or
circumstance
brings
my
youth
back
in
detail
that
i
can
scarce
bear
it
you
have
brought
it
back
flemington
and
this
morning
i
am
face
to
face
with
it
again
it
does
not
sound
as
if
you
had
outlived
it
said
the
young
man
life
is
made
of
many
things
said
james
whether
we
have
lost
our
all
or
not
we
have
to
plough
on
to
the
end
and
it
is
best
to
plough
on
merrily
lacy
never
complained
of
me
as
a
companion
in
the
long
time
we
were
together
for
i
was
on
his
staff
and
i
took
all
that
came
to
me
as
i
have
done
always
there
were
some
mad
fellows
among
us
and
i
was
no
saner
than
they
but
life
is
quiet
enough
here
in
the
year
since
i
came
home
to
my
good
brother
the
mention
of
lord
balnillo
made
flemington
start
gad
he
exclaimed
rising
thankful
for
escape
and
i
am
to
begin
the
portrait
this
morning
and
have
set
out
none
of
my
colours
and
i
have
gone
breakfastless
said
logie
with
a
smile
and
worse
than
that
i
have
spoilt
the
sunshine
for
you
with
my
tongue
that
should
have
been
silent
no
no
burst
out
flemington
rather
hoarsely
do
think
of
that
if
you
only
knew
he
stood
unable
to
finish
his
sentence
or
to
utter
one
word
of
comfort
without
plunging
deeper
into
i
must
go
he
stammered
i
must
leave
you
and
run
james
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
him
listen
flemington
he
said
listen
before
you
go
we
have
learnt
something
of
each
other
you
and
i
promise
me
that
if
ever
you
should
find
yourself
in
such
a
position
as
the
one
you
spoke
of
if
you
should
come
to
such
a
strait
as
that
if
a
little
help
could
make
you
free
you
will
come
to
me
as
if
i
were
your
brother
your
eyes
are
so
like
diane
you
might
well
be
hers
archie
stood
before
him
dumb
as
james
held
out
his
hand
he
grasped
it
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
from
him
in
a
tumult
of
horror
and
despair
chapter
viii
the
heavy
hand
it
was
on
the
following
day
that
lord
balnillo
stood
in
front
of
a
length
canvas
in
the
improvised
studio
archie
had
begun
to
put
on
the
colour
that
morning
and
the
judge
had
come
quietly
upstairs
to
study
the
first
dawnings
of
his
own
countenance
alone
from
the
midst
of
a
chaos
of
paint
his
features
were
beginning
to
appear
like
the
sun
through
a
fog
he
had
brought
a
small
with
him
tucked
away
under
his
velvet
coat
where
it
could
not
be
seen
and
he
now
produced
it
and
began
to
compare
his
face
with
the
one
before
him
flemington
was
a
quick
worker
and
though
he
had
been
given
only
two
sittings
there
was
enough
on
the
canvas
to
prompt
the
gratified
smile
on
the
old
man
lips
he
looked
alternately
at
his
reflection
and
at
the
judicial
figure
on
the
easel
archie
had
a
tactful
brush
but
though
balnillo
was
pleased
he
could
not
help
sighing
for
he
wished
fervently
that
his
ankles
had
been
included
in
the
picture
he
stooped
and
ran
his
hand
lovingly
down
his
silk
stockings
then
he
took
up
the
glass
again
and
began
to
compose
his
expression
into
the
rather
more
lofty
one
with
which
flemington
had
supplied
him
in
the
full
swing
of
his
occupation
he
turned
round
to
find
the
painter
standing
in
the
doorway
but
he
was
just
too
late
to
catch
the
sudden
flash
of
amusement
that
played
across
archie
face
as
he
saw
what
the
judge
was
doing
balnillo
thrust
the
glass
out
of
sight
and
confronted
his
guest
i
thought
you
had
gone
for
a
stroll
sir
he
said
rather
stiffly
my
lord
exclaimed
flemington
i
have
been
searching
for
you
everywhere
i
come
with
infinite
regret
to
tell
you
that
i
must
return
to
ardguys
at
once
balnillo
jaw
dropped
i
have
just
met
a
messenger
on
the
road
said
the
other
he
has
brought
news
that
my
grandmother
is
taken
ill
and
i
must
hurry
home
it
is
most
unfortunate
most
disappointing
but
go
i
must
tut
tut
tut
exclaimed
the
old
man
clicking
his
tongue
against
his
teeth
and
forgetting
to
hope
as
politeness
decreed
he
should
that
the
matter
was
not
serious
it
is
a
said
archie
tut
tut
said
balnillo
again
i
am
most
distressed
to
hear
it
i
am
indeed
i
be
able
to
come
back
and
finish
the
picture
later
i
hope
so
i
sincerely
hope
so
i
was
just
studying
the
admirable
likeness
when
you
came
in
said
balnillo
who
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
know
how
much
of
his
posturing
flemington
had
seen
ah
my
lord
cried
archie
a
poor
devil
like
me
has
no
chance
with
you
i
saw
the
mirror
in
your
hand
we
painters
use
a
piece
of
to
correct
our
drawing
but
it
is
few
of
our
sitters
who
know
that
trick
guilty
dismay
was
chased
by
relief
across
balnillo
countenance
you
are
too
clever
for
me
laughed
flemington
how
did
you
learn
it
may
i
ask
but
balnillo
had
got
his
presence
of
mind
back
casually
flemington
casually
as
one
learns
many
things
if
one
keeps
one
ears
open
said
he
a
couple
of
hours
later
archie
was
on
his
way
home
he
had
left
one
horse
still
disabled
in
the
judge
stable
and
he
was
riding
the
other
into
brechin
where
he
would
get
a
fresh
one
to
take
him
on
balnillo
had
persuaded
him
to
leave
his
belongings
where
they
were
until
he
knew
what
chance
there
was
of
an
early
return
he
had
parted
from
archie
with
reluctance
although
the
portrait
was
the
old
principal
interest
its
maker
counted
for
much
with
him
for
it
was
some
time
since
his
ideas
had
been
made
to
move
as
they
always
moved
in
flemington
presence
the
judge
got
much
pleasure
out
of
his
own
curiosity
and
the
element
of
the
unexpected
that
fascinating
factor
which
had
been
introduced
into
domestic
life
was
a
continual
joy
balnillo
had
missed
it
more
than
he
knew
since
he
had
become
a
completely
rural
character
archie
saw
the
basin
of
montrose
drop
behind
him
as
he
rode
away
with
a
stir
of
mixed
feelings
the
net
that
logie
had
in
all
ignorance
spread
for
him
had
entangled
his
feet
he
had
never
conceived
a
like
situation
and
it
startled
him
to
discover
that
a
difficulty
nowhere
touching
the
tangible
could
be
so
potent
so
disastrous
he
felt
like
a
man
who
has
been
tripped
up
and
who
suddenly
finds
himself
on
the
ground
he
had
risen
and
fled
the
position
had
become
intolerable
he
told
himself
in
his
impetuous
way
that
it
was
more
than
he
could
bear
and
now
every
bit
of
luck
he
had
turned
to
account
every
precaution
he
had
taken
all
the
ingenuity
he
had
used
to
land
himself
in
the
hostile
camp
were
to
go
for
nothing
because
some
look
in
his
face
some
droop
of
the
eyes
had
reminded
another
man
of
his
own
past
and
had
let
loose
in
him
an
overwhelming
impulse
to
expression
remember
what
i
told
you
yesterday
had
been
james
last
words
as
flemington
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
there
must
be
no
more
challenges
it
was
that
flower
of
his
own
imagination
the
picture
of
himself
in
the
servants
hall
that
had
finally
accomplished
his
defeat
how
could
he
betray
the
man
who
was
ready
to
share
his
purse
with
him
and
putting
the
matter
of
the
purse
aside
his
painter
imagination
was
set
alight
the
glow
of
the
tulips
and
the
strange
house
by
the
winding
water
the
slim
vision
of
diane
de
montdelys
the
gallant
background
of
the
scots
brigade
the
grave
at
these
things
were
like
a
mirage
behind
the
figure
of
james
the
power
of
seeing
things
picturesquely
is
a
gift
that
can
turn
into
a
curse
and
that
power
worked
on
his
emotional
and
imaginative
side
now
and
furthermore
beyond
what
might
be
called
the
ornamental
part
of
his
difficulty
he
realized
that
friendship
with
james
had
he
been
free
to
offer
or
to
accept
it
would
have
been
a
lifelong
prize
they
had
spent
the
preceding
day
together
after
the
sitting
was
over
and
though
logie
had
opened
his
heart
no
more
and
their
talk
had
been
of
the
common
interests
of
men
lives
it
had
strengthened
resolve
to
end
the
situation
and
to
save
himself
while
there
was
yet
time
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
flight
he
had
told
the
judge
that
he
would
try
to
return
but
he
did
not
mean
to
enter
the
gates
of
balnillo
again
not
while
the
country
was
seething
with
prince
charlie
plots
perhaps
never
he
would
remember
james
all
his
life
but
he
hoped
that
their
ways
might
never
cross
again
and
behind
that
there
was
regret
regret
for
the
friend
who
might
have
been
his
who
in
his
secret
heart
would
be
his
always
he
could
even
now
hardly
realize
that
he
had
been
actually
turned
from
his
purpose
it
seemed
to
him
incredible
but
there
was
one
thing
more
incredible
still
and
that
was
that
he
could
raise
his
hand
to
strike
again
at
the
man
who
had
been
stricken
so
terribly
and
with
the
same
weapon
of
betrayal
it
would
be
as
if
james
lay
wounded
on
a
and
he
should
come
by
to
stab
him
anew
the
blow
he
should
deal
him
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
past
but
archie
felt
that
james
had
so
connected
him
in
mind
with
the
memory
of
the
woman
he
resembled
had
by
that
one
burst
of
confidence
given
him
so
much
part
in
the
sacred
kingdom
of
remembrance
wherein
she
dwelt
that
it
would
be
almost
as
if
something
from
out
of
the
past
had
struck
at
him
across
her
grave
archie
sighed
weary
and
sick
with
fate
ironic
jests
there
were
some
things
he
could
not
do
the
two
men
had
avoided
politics
though
flemington
insinuations
had
conveyed
to
the
brothers
that
he
was
with
themselves
the
prince
name
was
not
mentioned
there
was
so
much
brewing
in
brain
that
the
very
birds
of
the
air
must
not
hear
sorry
as
he
was
when
flemington
met
him
with
the
news
of
his
unexpected
recall
he
had
decided
that
it
was
well
the
young
man
should
go
when
this
time
of
stress
was
over
when
and
if
the
cause
he
served
should
prevail
he
would
seek
out
archie
the
if
was
very
clear
to
james
for
he
had
seen
enough
of
men
and
causes
of
troops
and
campaigns
and
the
practical
difficulties
of
great
movements
to
know
that
he
was
spending
himself
in
what
might
well
be
a
forlorn
hope
but
none
the
less
was
he
determined
to
see
it
through
for
his
heart
was
deep
in
it
and
besides
that
he
had
the
temperament
that
is
attracted
by
forlorn
hopes
he
was
a
reticent
man
in
spite
of
the
opening
of
that
page
in
his
life
which
he
had
laid
before
flemington
and
reticent
characters
are
often
those
most
prone
to
rare
and
unexpected
bouts
of
but
when
the
impulse
is
past
and
the
load
ever
present
with
them
has
been
lightened
for
a
moment
they
will
thrust
it
yet
farther
back
behind
the
door
of
their
lips
and
give
the
key
a
double
turn
he
had
enjoined
flemington
to
come
to
him
as
he
would
come
to
a
brother
for
assistance
and
it
had
seemed
to
archie
that
life
would
have
little
more
to
offer
had
it
only
given
him
a
brother
like
james
a
cloud
was
on
his
spirit
as
he
neared
brechin
when
he
left
the
inn
and
would
have
paid
the
landlord
he
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
to
discover
a
thin
sealed
packet
at
the
bottom
of
it
he
drew
it
out
and
found
to
his
surprise
that
though
his
name
was
on
it
it
was
unopened
and
that
he
had
never
seen
it
before
while
he
turned
it
over
something
told
him
that
the
unknown
handwriting
it
bore
was
that
of
james
logie
the
coat
he
wore
had
hung
in
the
hall
at
balnillo
since
the
preceding
night
and
the
packet
must
have
been
slipped
into
it
before
he
started
as
he
rode
along
he
broke
the
seal
the
paper
it
contained
had
neither
beginning
nor
signature
yet
he
knew
that
his
guess
was
right
you
will
be
surprised
at
finding
this
he
read
but
i
wish
you
to
read
it
when
there
are
some
miles
between
us
in
these
disturbed
days
it
is
not
possible
to
tell
when
we
may
meet
again
should
you
return
i
may
be
here
or
i
may
be
gone
god
knows
where
and
for
reasons
of
which
i
need
not
speak
my
brother
may
be
the
last
man
to
know
where
i
am
but
for
the
sake
of
all
i
spoke
of
yesterday
i
ask
you
to
believe
that
i
am
your
friend
do
not
forget
that
in
any
strait
i
am
at
your
back
because
it
is
true
i
give
you
these
two
directions
a
message
carried
to
rob
smith
tavern
in
the
castle
wynd
at
stirling
will
reach
me
eventually
wheresoever
i
am
nearer
home
you
may
hear
of
me
also
there
is
a
little
house
on
the
muir
of
pert
the
only
house
on
the
north
side
of
the
muir
a
mile
west
of
the
the
man
who
lives
there
is
in
constant
touch
with
me
if
you
should
find
yourself
in
urgent
need
i
will
send
you
the
sum
of
one
hundred
pounds
through
him
flemington
you
will
make
no
hesitation
in
the
matter
you
will
take
it
for
the
sake
of
one
i
have
spoken
of
to
none
but
you
these
years
and
years
past
and
now
he
had
to
go
home
and
to
tell
madam
flemington
that
he
had
wantonly
thrown
away
all
the
advantages
gained
in
the
last
three
days
that
he
had
tossed
them
to
the
wind
for
a
mere
sentimental
scruple
so
far
he
had
never
quarrelled
with
his
occupation
but
now
because
it
had
brought
him
up
against
a
soldier
of
fortune
whose
existence
he
had
been
unaware
of
a
few
weeks
ago
he
had
sacrificed
it
and
played
a
sorry
trick
on
his
own
prospects
at
the
same
time
he
was
trusted
and
valued
by
his
own
party
and
in
spite
of
his
youth
had
given
it
excellent
service
again
and
again
he
could
hardly
expect
the
determined
woman
who
had
made
him
what
he
was
to
see
eye
to
eye
with
him
christian
flemington
had
kept
her
supremacy
over
her
grandson
parental
authority
was
a
much
stronger
thing
in
the
century
than
it
is
now
and
she
stood
in
the
position
of
a
parent
to
him
his
french
blood
and
her
long
residence
in
france
had
made
their
relationship
something
like
that
of
a
french
mother
and
son
and
she
had
all
his
confidence
in
his
young
man
scrapes
for
she
recognized
phases
of
life
that
are
apt
to
be
ignored
by
english
parents
in
dealing
with
their
children
she
had
cut
him
loose
from
her
early
but
she
had
moulded
him
with
infinite
care
before
she
let
him
go
there
was
a
touch
of
genius
in
archie
a
flicker
of
what
she
called
the
and
she
had
kept
it
burning
before
her
own
shrine
the
fine
unscrupulousness
that
was
her
main
characteristic
her
manner
of
breasting
the
tide
of
circumstance
full
sail
awed
and
charmed
him
for
all
his
boldness
and
initiative
his
independence
of
will
and
his
originality
in
the
conduct
of
his
affairs
he
had
never
freed
his
inner
self
from
her
thrall
and
she
held
him
by
the
strong
impression
she
had
made
on
his
imagination
years
and
years
ago
she
had
set
her
mark
upon
the
plastic
character
of
the
little
boy
whom
she
had
beaten
for
painting
duthie
that
was
an
episode
which
he
had
never
forgotten
which
he
always
thought
of
with
a
smile
and
while
he
remembered
the
sting
of
her
cane
he
also
remembered
her
masterly
routing
of
his
enemy
before
she
applied
it
she
had
punished
him
with
the
thoroughness
that
was
hers
but
she
had
never
allowed
the
minister
to
know
what
she
had
done
technically
she
had
been
on
the
side
of
the
angels
but
in
reality
she
had
stood
by
the
culprit
in
spirit
they
had
resented
duthie
together
he
slept
at
forfar
that
night
and
pushed
on
again
next
morning
and
as
he
saw
the
old
house
across
the
dip
and
heard
the
purl
of
the
burn
at
the
end
of
his
journey
something
in
his
heart
failed
him
the
liquid
whisper
of
the
water
through
the
fine
rushlike
grass
spoke
to
him
of
childhood
and
of
the
time
when
there
was
no
world
but
ardguys
no
monarch
but
madam
flemington
he
seemed
to
feel
her
influence
coming
out
to
meet
him
at
every
step
his
horse
took
how
could
he
tell
his
news
how
could
he
explain
what
he
had
done
they
had
never
touched
on
ethical
questions
he
and
she
as
he
came
up
the
muddy
road
between
the
he
felt
the
chilly
throe
the
intense
spiritual
discomfort
that
attends
our
plunges
from
one
atmosphere
into
another
it
is
the
penalty
of
those
who
live
their
lives
with
every
nerve
and
fibre
who
take
fervent
part
in
the
lives
of
other
people
to
suffer
acutely
in
the
struggle
to
loose
themselves
from
an
environment
they
have
just
quitted
and
to
meet
an
impending
one
without
distress
but
it
is
no
disproportionate
price
to
pay
for
learning
life
as
a
whole
also
it
is
the
only
price
accepted
he
put
his
horse
into
the
stable
and
went
to
the
garden
being
told
that
madam
flemington
was
there
the
day
was
warm
and
bright
and
as
he
swung
the
gate
to
behind
him
he
saw
her
sitting
on
a
seat
at
the
angle
of
the
farther
wall
she
rose
at
the
click
of
the
latch
and
came
up
the
grass
path
to
meet
him
between
a
line
of
espalier
and
a
row
of
phlox
on
which
october
had
still
left
a
few
red
and
white
blossoms
the
eighteen
years
that
had
gone
by
since
the
episode
of
the
manse
had
not
done
much
to
change
her
appearance
the
shrinking
and
obliterating
of
personality
which
comes
with
the
passing
of
middle
life
had
not
begun
its
work
on
her
and
at
she
was
more
imposing
than
ever
she
had
grown
a
great
deal
stouter
but
the
distribution
of
flesh
had
been
even
and
she
carried
her
bulk
with
a
kind
of
triumph
as
a
ship
carries
her
canvas
a
brown
silk
mantle
woven
with
a
pattern
of
was
round
her
shoulders
and
she
held
its
thick
folds
together
with
one
hand
in
the
other
she
carried
the
book
she
had
been
reading
her
hair
was
as
abundant
as
ever
and
had
grown
no
whiter
the
sun
struck
on
its
silver
and
red
flashes
came
from
the
rubies
in
her
ears
she
said
nothing
as
archie
approached
but
her
eyes
spoke
inquiry
and
a
shadow
of
softness
flickered
over
so
slightly
round
her
broad
lips
she
was
pleased
to
see
him
but
the
shadow
was
caused
less
by
her
affection
for
him
than
by
her
appreciation
of
the
charming
figure
he
presented
seen
thus
suddenly
and
advancing
with
so
much
grace
of
movement
in
the
sunlight
she
stopped
short
when
he
was
within
a
few
steps
of
her
and
dropping
her
book
upon
the
ground
without
troubling
to
see
where
it
fell
held
out
her
hand
for
him
to
kiss
he
touched
it
with
his
lips
and
then
thrusting
his
arm
into
the
drew
out
the
volume
that
had
landed
among
them
from
between
the
leaves
dropped
a
folded
paper
on
which
he
recognized
his
own
handwriting
this
is
a
surprise
said
madam
flemington
looking
her
grandson
up
and
down
i
have
ridden
my
baggage
is
left
at
balnillo
the
moment
of
explanation
would
have
to
come
but
his
desire
was
to
put
it
off
as
long
as
possible
there
is
your
letter
between
the
pages
of
my
book
said
she
it
came
to
me
this
morning
and
i
was
reading
it
again
it
gave
me
immense
pleasure
archie
i
suppose
you
have
come
to
search
for
the
clothes
you
mentioned
i
am
glad
to
see
you
my
dear
but
it
is
a
long
ride
to
take
for
a
few
pairs
of
stockings
you
should
see
balnillo
hose
exclaimed
flemington
hurriedly
i
be
bound
the
old
buck
cost
him
as
much
as
his
estate
if
he
had
as
many
legs
as
a
centipede
he
would
have
them
all
in
silk
and
not
a
petticoat
about
the
place
none
nearer
than
the
kitchen
he
should
have
stayed
in
edinburgh
said
madam
flemington
laughing
she
loved
archie
society
i
hear
that
this
captain
logie
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
rebels
in
scotland
she
went
on
if
you
can
lay
him
by
the
heels
it
is
a
service
that
will
not
be
forgotten
so
far
you
have
done
mighty
well
archie
they
had
reached
the
gate
and
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
turn
back
she
said
i
must
consult
you
i
suppose
that
now
you
will
be
kept
for
some
time
at
balnillo
that
nest
of
treason
montrose
will
give
you
occupation
and
you
must
stretch
out
the
portrait
to
match
your
convenience
i
am
going
to
take
advantage
of
it
too
i
shall
go
to
edinburgh
while
you
are
away
to
edinburgh
exclaimed
flemington
why
not
pray
but
you
leave
ardguys
so
seldom
it
is
years
the
more
reason
i
should
go
now
interrupted
she
among
other
things
i
must
see
my
man
of
business
and
i
have
decided
to
do
it
now
i
shall
be
more
useful
to
you
in
edinburgh
too
i
have
been
too
long
out
of
personal
touch
with
those
who
can
advance
your
interests
i
had
a
letter
from
edinburgh
yesterday
you
are
better
thought
of
there
than
you
suspect
archie
i
did
not
realize
how
important
a
scoundrel
this
man
logie
is
nor
what
your
despatch
to
montrose
implied
he
was
silent
looking
on
the
ground
she
knew
every
turn
of
archie
manner
every
inflection
of
his
voice
there
was
a
gathering
sign
of
opposition
on
his
face
the
phantom
of
some
mood
that
must
not
be
allowed
to
gain
an
instant
strength
it
flashed
on
her
that
he
had
not
returned
merely
to
fetch
his
clothes
there
was
something
wrong
she
knew
that
at
this
moment
he
was
afraid
of
her
he
who
was
afraid
of
nothing
else
she
stopped
in
the
path
and
drew
herself
up
considering
where
she
should
strike
never
never
had
she
failed
to
bring
him
to
his
bearings
there
was
only
one
fitting
place
for
him
and
that
was
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
grandmother
i
shall
not
go
back
to
balnillo
said
he
vehemently
if
the
earth
had
risen
up
under
her
feet
madam
flemington
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
she
stood
immovable
looking
at
him
whilst
an
inward
voice
flying
through
her
mind
like
a
snatch
of
broken
sound
told
her
that
she
must
keep
her
head
she
made
no
feeble
mistake
in
that
moment
for
she
saw
the
vital
importance
of
the
conflict
impending
between
them
with
clear
eyes
she
knew
her
back
to
be
nearer
the
wall
than
it
had
been
yet
her
mind
was
as
agile
as
her
body
was
by
nature
indolent
and
it
was
always
ready
to
turn
in
any
direction
and
look
any
foe
squarely
in
the
face
she
was
startled
but
she
could
not
be
shaken
i
left
balnillo
for
good
said
he
again
i
can
not
go
back
i
will
not
you
not
said
christian
half
closing
her
eyes
the
pupils
had
contracted
and
looked
like
tiny
black
beads
set
in
a
narrow
glitter
of
grey
is
that
what
you
have
come
home
to
say
to
it
is
impossible
he
cried
turning
away
and
flinging
out
his
arms
it
is
more
than
i
can
do
i
will
not
go
after
logie
i
will
go
anywhere
else
do
anything
else
but
not
that
there
is
nothing
else
for
you
to
do
then
i
will
come
back
here
that
you
will
not
said
christian
he
drew
in
his
breath
as
if
he
had
been
struck
what
are
you
that
you
should
betray
me
and
yet
think
to
force
yourself
on
me
without
my
resenting
it
what
do
you
think
i
am
that
i
should
suffer
it
she
laughed
i
have
not
betrayed
you
said
he
in
a
husky
voice
the
loyal
worship
he
had
given
her
unquestioning
through
the
long
dependence
and
the
small
but
poignant
vicissitudes
of
childhood
came
back
on
him
like
a
returning
tide
and
doubled
the
cruelty
of
her
words
she
was
the
one
person
against
whom
he
felt
unable
to
defend
himself
he
loved
her
truly
and
the
thought
of
absolute
separation
from
her
came
over
him
like
a
chill
i
did
not
think
you
could
speak
to
me
in
this
way
it
is
terrible
he
said
his
dark
eyes
were
full
of
pain
he
spoke
as
simply
as
a
little
boy
satisfaction
stole
back
to
her
she
had
not
lost
her
hold
on
him
would
not
lose
it
another
woman
might
have
flung
an
affectionate
word
into
the
balance
to
give
the
final
clip
to
the
scale
but
she
never
thought
of
doing
that
neither
impulse
nor
calculation
suggested
it
because
affection
was
not
the
weapon
she
was
accustomed
to
trust
her
faith
was
in
the
heavy
hand
her
generalship
was
good
enough
to
tell
her
the
exact
moment
of
wavering
in
the
enemy
in
front
the
magic
instant
for
a
fresh
attack
you
are
a
bitter
disappointment
she
said
life
has
brought
me
many
but
you
are
the
greatest
i
have
had
to
go
without
some
necessities
in
my
time
and
i
now
shall
have
to
go
without
you
but
i
can
do
it
and
i
will
you
mean
that
you
will
turn
from
me
altogether
am
i
not
plain
enough
i
can
be
plainer
if
you
like
you
shall
go
out
of
this
house
and
go
where
you
will
i
do
not
care
where
you
go
but
you
are
forgetting
that
i
have
some
curiosity
i
wish
to
understand
what
has
happened
to
you
since
you
wrote
your
letter
that
is
excusable
surely
it
is
logie
said
he
he
has
made
it
impossible
for
me
i
can
not
cheat
a
man
who
has
given
me
all
his
confidence
he
gave
you
his
confidence
cried
madam
flemington
heavens
he
is
well
served
that
prince
when
his
servants
confide
in
the
first
stranger
they
meet
captain
logie
must
be
a
man
of
honour
he
is
said
archie
it
was
his
own
private
confidence
he
gave
me
i
heard
his
own
history
from
his
own
lips
and
knowing
it
i
can
not
go
on
deceiving
him
i
like
him
too
much
madam
flemington
was
confounded
the
difficulty
seemed
so
strangely
puerile
a
whim
a
fancy
was
to
ruin
the
work
of
years
and
turn
everything
upside
down
on
the
top
she
was
exasperated
with
archie
but
underneath
it
was
worse
she
found
her
influence
and
her
power
at
stake
and
her
slave
was
being
wrested
from
her
in
spite
of
every
interest
which
had
bound
them
together
she
loved
him
with
a
jealous
untender
love
that
was
dependent
on
outward
circumstances
and
she
was
proud
of
him
she
had
smiled
at
his
devotion
to
her
as
she
would
have
smiled
with
gratified
comprehension
at
the
fidelity
of
a
favourite
dog
understanding
the
creature
justifiable
feeling
and
knowing
how
creditable
it
was
to
its
intelligence
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
your
duty
she
demanded
my
duty
is
too
hard
he
cried
i
can
not
do
it
grandmother
hard
she
exclaimed
pah
you
weary
me
you
disgust
me
i
am
sick
of
you
archie
his
lip
quivered
and
he
met
her
eyes
with
a
mist
of
dazed
trouble
in
his
own
a
black
curtain
seemed
to
be
falling
between
them
i
told
him
every
absurdity
i
could
imagine
said
he
i
made
him
believe
that
i
was
dependent
upon
my
work
for
my
daily
bread
i
did
not
think
he
would
take
my
lies
as
he
did
his
kindness
was
so
great
so
generous
grandmother
he
would
have
had
me
promise
to
go
to
him
for
help
how
can
i
spy
upon
him
and
cheat
him
after
that
he
stopped
he
could
not
tell
her
more
for
he
knew
that
the
mention
of
the
hundred
pounds
would
but
make
her
more
angry
the
details
of
what
logie
had
written
could
be
given
to
no
one
he
was
only
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
destroy
the
paper
he
carried
we
have
to
do
with
principles
not
men
said
madam
flemington
he
is
a
rebel
to
his
king
if
i
thought
you
were
so
much
as
dreaming
of
going
over
to
those
worthless
stuarts
i
would
never
see
you
nor
speak
to
you
again
i
would
sooner
see
you
dead
is
what
is
in
your
mind
there
is
nothing
farther
from
my
thoughts
said
he
i
can
have
no
part
with
rebels
i
am
a
whig
and
i
shall
always
be
a
whig
i
have
told
you
the
plain
truth
and
now
will
tell
you
the
plain
truth
said
madam
flemington
while
i
am
alive
you
will
not
enter
ardguys
when
you
cut
yourself
off
from
me
you
will
do
so
finally
i
will
have
no
as
i
have
no
i
have
bred
you
up
to
support
king
interests
against
the
whole
band
of
paupers
at
germain
that
you
may
pay
a
part
of
the
debt
of
injury
they
laid
upon
me
and
mine
mary
beatrice
took
my
son
from
me
you
do
not
know
what
you
have
to
thank
her
for
archie
but
i
will
tell
you
now
you
have
to
thank
her
that
your
mother
was
a
girl
of
the
people
of
the
streets
a
slut
taken
into
the
palace
out
of
charity
she
was
forced
on
my
son
by
the
queen
and
her
favourite
lady
despard
that
was
how
they
rewarded
us
my
husband
and
me
for
our
fidelity
he
was
in
his
grave
and
knew
nothing
but
i
was
there
i
am
here
still
and
i
remember
still
the
little
muscles
round
her
strong
lips
were
quivering
archie
had
never
seen
madam
flemington
so
much
disturbed
and
it
was
something
of
a
shock
to
him
to
find
that
the
power
he
had
known
always
as
aloof
unruffled
could
be
at
the
mercy
of
so
much
feeling
lady
despard
was
one
of
that
irish
rabble
that
followed
king
james
along
with
better
people
a
woman
given
over
to
prayers
and
confessions
and
priests
she
is
dead
thank
god
it
was
she
who
took
your
mother
out
of
the
gutter
where
she
sang
from
door
to
door
meaning
to
make
a
nun
of
her
for
her
voice
was
remarkable
and
she
and
her
priests
would
have
trained
her
for
a
convent
choir
but
the
girl
had
no
stomach
for
a
nunnery
the
backstairs
of
the
palace
pleased
her
better
and
the
queen
took
her
into
her
household
and
would
have
her
sing
to
her
in
her
own
chamber
she
was
handsome
too
and
she
hid
the
devil
that
was
in
her
from
the
women
the
men
knew
her
better
and
the
chevalier
and
your
father
knew
her
best
of
all
but
at
last
lady
despard
got
wind
of
it
they
dared
not
turn
her
into
the
streets
for
fear
of
the
priests
and
to
save
her
own
son
the
queen
sacrificed
mine
she
stopped
looking
to
see
the
effect
of
her
words
archie
was
very
pale
is
my
true
name
flemington
he
asked
abruptly
you
are
my
own
flesh
and
blood
said
she
or
you
would
not
be
standing
here
their
fear
was
that
the
chevalier
would
marry
her
privately
but
they
got
him
out
of
the
way
and
your
father
seduced
the
girl
then
to
make
the
chevalier
doubly
safe
they
forced
him
to
make
her
his
wife
he
who
was
only
nineteen
they
did
it
secretly
but
when
the
marriage
was
known
i
would
not
receive
her
and
i
left
the
court
and
went
to
rouen
i
have
lived
ever
since
in
the
hope
of
seeing
the
stuarts
swept
from
the
earth
your
father
is
gone
and
you
are
all
i
have
left
but
you
shall
go
too
if
you
join
yourself
to
them
i
shall
not
do
that
said
he
do
you
understand
now
what
it
costs
me
to
see
you
turn
back
said
madam
flemington
the
mantle
had
slipped
from
her
shoulders
and
her
white
hands
crossed
at
the
wrists
lay
with
the
fingers
along
her
arms
she
stood
trying
to
dissect
the
component
parts
of
his
trouble
and
to
fashion
something
out
of
them
on
which
she
might
make
a
new
attack
forces
outside
her
own
understanding
were
at
work
in
him
which
were
strong
enough
to
take
the
fine
edge
of
humiliation
off
the
history
she
had
just
told
him
she
guessed
their
presence
unseen
though
they
were
and
her
acute
practical
mind
was
searching
for
them
she
was
like
an
astronomer
whose
telescope
is
turned
on
the
tract
of
sky
in
which
as
his
science
tells
him
some
unknown
body
will
arise
she
had
always
taken
his
pride
of
race
for
granted
as
she
took
her
own
the
influx
of
the
base
blood
of
the
slut
had
been
a
mortification
unspeakable
but
to
madam
flemington
the
actual
treachery
practised
on
her
had
not
been
the
crowning
insult
the
thing
was
bad
but
the
manner
of
its
doing
was
worse
for
the
queen
and
lady
despard
had
used
young
flemington
as
though
he
had
been
of
no
account
the
flemingtons
had
served
james
stuart
taking
his
evil
fortunes
as
though
they
had
been
their
own
they
had
done
it
of
their
own
free
will
but
mary
beatrice
and
her
favourite
had
treated
christian
and
her
son
as
slaves
chattels
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
needs
of
their
owner
there
was
enough
nobility
in
christian
to
see
that
part
of
the
business
as
its
blackest
spot
she
had
kept
the
knowledge
of
it
from
archie
because
she
had
the
instinct
common
to
all
savage
creatures
and
christian
affinity
with
savage
creatures
was
a
close
one
for
the
concealment
of
desperate
wounds
her
silks
her
ruby
earrings
her
physical
indolence
her
white
hands
all
the
refinements
that
had
accrued
to
her
in
her
life
all
that
went
to
make
the
outward
presentment
of
the
woman
was
the
mere
ornamental
covering
of
the
savage
in
her
that
savage
watched
archie
now
madam
flemington
was
removed
by
two
generations
from
archie
and
there
was
a
gulf
of
evolution
between
them
unrealized
by
either
their
conscious
ideals
might
be
identical
but
their
unconscious
ideals
those
that
count
with
nations
and
with
individuals
were
different
and
the
same
trouble
one
that
might
be
accepted
and
acknowledged
by
each
must
affect
each
differently
the
old
regard
a
tragedy
through
its
influences
on
the
past
and
the
young
through
its
influences
on
the
future
to
archie
madam
flemington
revelation
was
an
insignificant
thing
compared
to
the
horror
that
was
upon
him
now
it
was
done
and
it
could
not
be
undone
and
he
was
himself
with
his
life
before
him
in
spite
of
it
it
was
like
the
withered
leaf
of
a
poisonous
plant
a
thing
rendered
innocuous
by
the
processes
of
nature
what
process
of
nature
could
make
his
agony
innocuous
the
word
had
become
a
nightmare
to
him
and
on
every
side
he
was
fated
to
hear
it
its
full
meaning
had
only
been
brought
home
to
him
two
days
ago
and
now
the
hateful
thing
was
being
pressed
on
him
by
one
who
had
suffered
from
it
bitterly
what
could
he
say
to
her
how
was
he
to
make
her
see
as
he
saw
his
difficulty
was
a
sentimental
one
and
one
that
she
would
not
recognize
archie
was
not
logical
he
had
still
not
much
feeling
about
having
deceived
lord
balnillo
whose
hospitality
he
had
accepted
and
enjoyed
but
as
he
had
said
he
could
not
go
after
james
who
had
offered
him
a
brother
help
whose
heart
he
had
seen
whose
life
had
already
been
cut
in
two
by
the
baneful
thing
there
was
little
room
in
archie
soul
for
anything
but
the
shadow
of
that
nightmare
of
treachery
and
the
shadow
was
creeping
towards
him
had
his
mother
been
a
of
spotless
reputation
what
could
her
virtue
or
her
blue
blood
avail
him
in
his
present
distress
she
was
nothing
to
him
that
slut
who
had
brought
him
forth
he
owed
her
no
allegiance
bore
her
no
grudge
the
living
woman
to
whom
he
owed
all
stood
before
him
beloved
admired
cutting
him
to
the
heart
he
assented
silently
but
christian
understood
that
though
he
looked
as
if
she
had
carried
her
point
his
looks
were
the
only
really
unreliable
part
of
him
she
knew
that
he
was
that
curious
thing
a
man
who
could
keep
his
true
self
separate
from
his
moods
it
had
taken
her
years
to
learn
that
but
she
had
learnt
it
at
last
for
once
she
was
like
other
people
baffled
by
his
naturalness
it
was
plain
that
he
suffered
yet
she
could
not
tell
how
she
was
to
mould
the
hard
stuff
hidden
below
his
suffering
but
she
must
work
with
the
heavy
hand
you
will
leave
here
she
said
you
shall
not
stay
here
to
shirk
your
duty
and
again
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
contracted
as
she
said
it
i
will
go
now
said
he
chapter

whom
he
regarded

foreman
of
a
working
gang
was
the
yellow
cur
the
abuse
he
poured
over
the
heads
of
his
servants
was
meant
more
as
incentive
than
as
rebuke
and
he
fed
them
well
sharing
his
substance
honestly
with
them
and
looking
to
them
for
arduous
service
in
return
they
were
a
faithful
intelligent
lot
but
for
one
of
the
collies
and
the
accepted
predominance
of
the
yellow
cur
was
merely
one
more
illustration
of
the
triumph
of
personality
his
golden
eyes
clear
like
unclouded
amber
contrasted
with
the
thick
and
vulgar
yellow
of
his
close
coat
and
the
contrast
was
like
that
between
spirit
and
flesh
he
was
a
strong
untiring
creature
with
blunt
jaws
and
legs
that
seemed
to
be
made
of
steel
and
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
seldom
laid
down
but
at
night
and
would
stand
turned
in
his
traces
as
though
waiting
for
orders
looking
towards
his
master
as
the
latter
sang
or
piped
whilst
his
comrades
extended
in
the
dust
took
advantage
of
the
halt
the
party
was
drawn
up
under
the
lee
of
a
low
wall
by
the
grassy
side
of
the
brechin
road
and
its
grotesqueness
seemed
greater
than
ever
because
of
its
entirely
unsuitable
background
the
wall
encircled
the
site
of
an
ancient
building
called
magdalen
chapel
which
had
long
been
ruined
and
now
only
survived
in
one
detached
fragment
and
in
the
traces
of
its
foundations
round
it
the
tangled
grass
rose
and
a
forest
of
withered
hemlock
that
had
nearly
choked
out
the
nettles
stood
up
traced
like
lacework
against
the
line
of
hills
beyond
the
basin
in
summer
its
powdery
white
threw
an
evanescent
grace
over
the
spot
the
place
was
a
haunt
of
skirling
wattie
for
it
was
a
convenient
house
between
montrose
and
brechin
and
the
trees
about
it
gave
a
comforting
shelter
from
both
sun
and
rain
the
tailboard
of
the
cart
was
turned
to
the
wall
so
that
the
piper
could
lean
his
broad
back
against
it
and
there
being
not
a
dozen
inches
between
the
bottom
of
his
cart
and
the
ground
he
was
hidden
from
anyone
who
might
chance
to
be
in
the
chapel
precincts
the
projecting
stone
which
made
a
stile
for
those
who
entered
the
enclosure
was
just
level
with
his
shoulder
and
he
had
laid
his
pipes
on
it
while
he
sat
with
folded
arms
and
considered
the
situation
he
had
just
been
begging
at
a
farm
and
he
had
heard
a
rumour
there
that
archie
flemington
was
gone
from
balnillo
and
had
been
seen
in
brechin
riding
westwards
on
the
preceding
morning
the
beggar
had
got
a
letter
for
him
behind
his
sliding
boards
which
had
to
be
delivered
without
delay
doag
said
he
again
we
awa
to
auld
davie
skirling
wattie
distrusted
rumour
for
the
inexactitudes
of
human
observation
and
human
tongues
are
better
known
to
a
man
who
lives
by
his
wits
than
to
anybody
else
he
was
not
going
to
accept
this
news
without
sifting
it
to
balnillo
he
would
go
to
find
out
whether
the
report
was
true
the
only
drawback
was
that
auld
davie
as
he
called
the
judge
abhorred
and
disapproved
of
beggars
and
he
did
not
know
how
he
might
stay
in
the
place
long
enough
to
find
out
what
he
wanted
he
was
a
privileged
person
at
most
houses
from
the
sea
on
the
east
to
forfar
on
the
west
but
lord
balnillo
would
none
of
him
nevertheless
he
turned
the
wheels
of
his
chariot
in
his
direction
he
wondered
as
he
went
along
why
he
had
not
seen
archie
by
the
way
but
archie
had
not
left
balnillo
by
the
brechin
road
being
anxious
to
avoid
him
what
was
the
use
of
receiving
instructions
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
carry
out
the
last
person
he
wished
to
meet
was
the
beggar
wattie
turned
into
the
balnillo
gates
and
went
up
the
avenue
towards
the
stable
his
pipes
were
silent
and
the
fallen
leaves
muffled
the
sound
of
his
wheels
he
knew
about
the
mishap
that
had
brought
flemington
as
a
guest
to
the
judge
and
about
the
portrait
he
was
painting
for
tidings
of
all
the
happenings
in
the
house
reached
the
mill
sooner
or
later
that
source
of
gossip
was
invaluable
to
him
but
though
the
miller
had
confirmed
the
report
that
flemington
had
gone
he
had
been
unable
to
tell
him
his
exact
destination
he
drove
into
the
stable
yard
and
found
it
empty
but
for
a
man
who
was
chopping
wood
the
latter
paused
between
his
strokes
as
he
saw
who
had
arrived
a
seekin
his
lordship
began
wattie
by
way
of
discovering
how
the
land
lay
then
ye
no
find
him
replied
the
woodman
who
was
none
other
than
the
elder
andrew
robieson
and
who
like
his
master
disapproved
consistently
of
the
beggar
he
was
a
sly
old
man
and
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
the
intruder
that
the
judge
though
not
in
the
house
was
within
hearing
of
the
pipes
it
was
his
boast
that
he
left
a
to
providence
but
he
was
not
above
an
occasional
shaping
of
events
to
suit
himself
the
beggar
rolled
up
to
the
at
the
brisk
pace
he
reserved
for
public
occasions
a
shriek
of
delight
came
from
the
kitchen
window
as
the
blast
of
his
pipes
buzzed
and
droned
across
the
yard
the
tune
of
the
nauk
of
fife
filled
the
place
a
couple
of
maidservants
came
out
and
stood
giggling
as
wattie
acknowledged
their
presence
by
a
wag
of
the
head
that
spoke
gallantry
patronage
ribaldry
anything
that
a
privileged
old
rogue
can
convey
to
young
womanhood
blooming
near
the
soil
a
groom
came
out
of
the
stable
and
joined
the
group
the
feet
of
the
girls
were
tapping
the
ground
the
beggar
expression
grew
more
genially
provocative
and
his
eyeballs
rolled
more
recklessly
as
he
blew
and
blew
his
time
was
perfect
the
groom
who
was
dancing
began
to
compose
steps
on
his
own
account
suddenly
there
was
a
whirl
of
petticoats
and
he
had
seized
one
of
the
girls
round
the
middle
they
spun
and
now
loosing
each
other
for
the
more
serious
business
of
each
one
individual
steps
now
enlacing
again
seeming
flung
together
by
some
resistless
elemental
wind
the
gaze
while
he
danced
alone
was
fixed
on
his
own
feet
as
though
he
were
chiding
them
admiring
them
directing
them
through
niceties
which
only
himself
could
appreciate
his
partner
hair
came
down
and
fell
in
a
loop
of
dull
over
her
back
she
was
a
girl
and
each
curve
of
her
body
seemed
to
be
surging
against
the
agitated
sheath
of
her
clothes
the
circled
round
the
pair
like
a
fragment
thrown
off
by
the
spin
of
some
travelling
meteor
the
passion
for
dancing
that
is
even
now
part
of
the
life
of
angus
had
caught
all
three
let
loose
upon
them
by
the
piper
handling
of
sound
and
rhythm
in
the
full
tide
of
their
intoxication
a
door
in
the
high
wall
of
the
yard
opened
and
lord
balnillo
came
through
it
the
fragment
broke
from
its
erratic
orbit
and
fled
into
the
house
with
a
scream
the
meteor
a
whirling
rushed
on
unseeing
the
piper
who
saw
well
enough
played
strong
and
loud
not
the
king
himself
could
have
stopped
him
in
the
middle
of
a
strathspey
the
yellow
dog
on
his
feet
among
his
reposing
companions
showed
a
narrow
white
line
between
his
lips
and
the
hackles
rose
upon
his
plebeian
neck
silence
cried
lord
balnillo
but
the
rest
of
his
words
were
drowned
by
the
yell
of
the
pipes
as
the
dancers
drew
asunder
again
they
saw
him
and
stopped
his
wrath
was
centred
on
the
beggar
and
man
and
maid
slunk
away
unrebuked
wattie
finished
his
tune
conscientiously
to
balnillo
impotent
in
the
hurricane
of
braying
reeds
each
note
that
kept
him
dumb
was
a
new
insult
and
he
could
see
the
knowledge
of
that
fact
in
the
face
as
the
music
ceased
the
beggar
swept
off
his
bonnet
displaying
his
disreputable
bald
head
and
bowed
like
the
sovereign
of
some
jovial
and
misgoverned
kingdom
the
yellow
dog
attitude
forbade
balnillo
nearer
approach
go
shouted
the
judge
pointing
a
shaking
forefinger
into
space
out
with
you
instantly
is
my
house
to
be
turned
into
a
house
of
call

my
gates

from
here
immediately
or
i
will
send

my
men
to

out
but
he
leaped
back
for
he
had
taken
a
step
forward
in
his
excitement
and
the
yellow
cur
teeth
were
bare
a
seekin
the
said
the
beggar
giving
the
dog
a
cuff
away
with

with

a
like
brechin

rejoined
the
beggar
it
couthier
in
there
balnillo
was
a
humane
man
and
he
prided
himself
as
all
the
world
knew
on
some
improvements
he
had
suggested
in
the
montrose
prison
he
was
speechless
ay
continued

tolbooth
but
dod
a
no

that
a
asking

one
of

fatal
qualities
was
his
power
of
turning
in
of
wrath
or
eloquence
to
daily
with
he
swallowed
the
fury
rising
to
his
lips
what

skirling

an

him
the

it
this

he
unscrewed
the
chanter
and
blew
a
few
piercing
notes
the
sound
flew
into
the
judge
face
like
the
impact
of
a
shower
of
pebbles
he
clapped
his
hands
to
his
ears
i
tell

he
bawled
raising
his
voice
above
the
din

is
gone
he
is
at
ardguys
by
this
time
man

exclaimed
wattie
dropping
his

is
yon
the
way
to
speak
to
his

said
the
deep
voice
of
andrew
robieson
who
had
come
up
silently
his
arms
full
of
wood
behind
the
beggar
cart
turn
this
vagabond
away
exclaimed
balnillo
almost
beside
himself
send
for
the
men
bring
a
horsewhip
from
the
stable
impudent
rogue
go
robieson
quick
man
but
wattie
switch
was
in
his
hand
and
the
dogs
were
already
turning
before
the
elder
had
time
to
reach
the
stables
he
had
passed
out
under
the
clock
and
was
disappearing
between
the
trees
of
the
avenue
he
had
learned
what
he
wished
to
know
and
the
farther
side
of
brechin
would
be
the
best
place
for
him
for
the
next
few
days
he
reflected
that
fortune
had
favoured
him
in
keeping
captain
logie
out
of
the
way
there
would
have
been
no
parleying
with

x
adrift
archie
rode
along
in
a
dream
he
had
gone
straight
out
of
the
garden
taken
his
horse
from
the
stable
and
ridden
back
to
forfar
following
the
blind
resolution
to
escape
from
ardguys
before
he
should
have
time
to
realize
what
it
was
costing
him
he
had
changed
horses
at
the
and
turned
his
face
along
the
way
he
had
come
through
his
pain
and
perplexity
the
only
thing
that
stood
fast
was
his
determination
not
to
return
to
balnillo
i
will
go
now
he
had
said
to
madam
flemington
and
he
had
gone
without
another
word
keeping
his
very
thoughts
within
the
walled
circle
of
his
resolution
lest
they
should
turn
to
look
at
familiar
things
that
might
thrust
out
hands
full
of
old
memories
to
hold
him
back
in
the
middle
of
his
careless
life
he
found
himself
cut
adrift
without
warning
from
those
associations
that
he
now
began
to
feel
he
had
valued
too
little
taken
for
granted
too
much
balnillo
was
impossible
for
him
and
in
consequence
he
was
to
be
a
stranger
in
his
own
home
madam
flemington
had
made
no
concession
and
had
put
no
term
to
his
banishment
and
though
he
could
not
believe
that
such
a
state
of
things
could
last
and
that
one
sudden
impulse
of
hers
could
hurl
him
out
of
her
life
for
ever
she
who
had
lived
for
him
had
told
him
that
she
would
do
without
him
then
as
he
assured
himself
of
this
from
that
dim
recess
wherein
a
latent
truth
hides
until
some
outside
light
flashes
upon
its
lair
came
the
realization
that
she
had
not
lived
for
him
alone
she
had
lived
for
him
that
she
might
make
him
into
the
instrument
she
desired
a
weapon
fashioned
to
her
hand
wherewith
she
might
return
blow
for
blow
all
at
once
the
thought
made
him
spiritually
sick
and
the
glory
and
desirableness
of
life
seemed
to
fade
he
could
not
see
through
its
dark
places
dark
where
all
had
been
sunshine
he
had
been
a
boy
yesterday
a
man
only
by
virtue
of
his
astounding
courage
and
resource
but
he
was
awakening
from
boyhood
and
manhood
was
hard
his
education
had
begun
and
he
could
not
value
the
education
of
pain
the
soundest
the
most
costly
one
there
is
any
more
than
any
of
us
do
whilst
it
lasts
he
did
not
think
any
more
than
any
of
us
think
that
perhaps
when
we
come
to
lie
on
our
we
shall
know
that
of
all
the
privileges
of
the
life
behind
us
the
greatest
has
been
the
privilege
of
having
suffered
and
fought
all
he
knew
was
that
his
heart
ached
that
he
had
disappointed
and
estranged
the
person
he
loved
best
and
had
lost
at
any
rate
temporarily
the
home
that
had
been
so
dear
but
hope
would
not
desert
him
in
spite
of
everything
madam
flemington
had
gone
very
wide
of
the
mark
in
suspecting
him
of
any
leaning
towards
the
stuarts
and
she
would
soon
understand
how
little
intention
he
had
of
turning
rebel
there
was
still
work
for
him
to
do
he
had
been
given
a
free
hand
in
details
and
he
would
go
to
brechin
for
the
night
he
must
decide
what
to
do
possibly
he
would
ask
to
be
transferred
to
some
other
place
but
nothing
that
heaven
or
earth
could
offer
him
should
make
him
betray
logie
madam
flemington
had
seen
him
go
in
ignorance
of
whether
he
had
gone
in
obedience
or
in
revolt
perhaps
she
imagined
that
her
arguments
and
the
hateful
story
she
had
laid
bare
to
him
had
prevailed
and
that
he
was
returning
to
his
unfinished
portrait
in
the
excitement
of
his
interview
with
her
he
had
not
told
her
anything
but
that
he
refused
definitely
to
spy
upon
james
any
more
he
had
started
for
ardguys
so
early
and
had
been
there
such
a
short
time
that
he
was
back
in
forfar
by
noon
there
he
left
his
horse
and
mounting
another
set
off
for
brechin
he
was
within
sight
of
its
ancient
round
tower
grey
among
the
yellowing
trees
above
the
south
esk
when
close
to
his
left
hand
there
rose
the
shrill
screech
of
a
pipe
cutting
into
his
abstraction
of
mind
like
a
sharp
stab
of
pain
it
was
so
loud
and
sudden
that
the
horse
leaped
to
the
farther
side
of
the
road
snorting
and
flemington
sitting
loosely
nearly
lost
his
seat
he
pulled
up
the
astonished
animal
and
peered
into
a
thicket
of
alder
growing
by
the
wayside
the
ground
was
marshy
and
the
stunted
trees
were
set
close
but
dividing
their
branches
he
saw
behind
their
screen
an
open
patch
in
the
midst
of
which
was
skirling
cart
his
jovial
face
seemed
to
illuminate
the
spot
dod
exclaimed
the
piper

and
looped

cried
wattie
as

began
to

through

a

feared
o

unchancy

archie
made
an
impatient
sound
and
threw
the
rein
over
a
stump
he
approached
the
cart
and
the
yellow
dog
who
was
for
once
lying
down
opened
his
wary
golden
eyes
watching
each
movement
that
brought
the
intruder
nearer
to
his
master
without
raising
his
head
you
are
not

archie

flemington
annoyance
deepened
he
did
not
know
what
the
zeal
of
this
insufferable
rascal
had
led
him
to
say
or
do
in
his
name
and
he
had
the
rueful
sense
that
the
tangle
he
had
paid
such
a
heavy
price
to
escape
from
was
complicating
round
him
the
officious
familiarity
of
the
piper
exasperated
him
and
he
resented
government
choice
of
such
a
tool
he
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
began
to
back
out
of
the
thicket
he
would
read
his
instructions
by
himself
hey
ye
no

wattie
i

said
flemington
his

in

but
ye
no

whaur
ye
gaein
brechin
archie
called
the
word
over
his
shoulder
and
started
off
at
a
trot
which
he
kept
up
until
he
had
left
the
some
way
behind
him
then
he
broke
the
seal
of
his
letter
and
found
that
he
was
to
convey
the
substance
of
each
report
that
he
sent
in
not
only
to
his
majesty
intelligence
officer
at
perth
but
to
captain
hall
of
the
english
ship
that
was
lying
under
ferryden
he
was
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
vessel
to
which
further
instructions
for
him
would
be
sent
in
a
couple
of
days
time
he
pocketed
the
letter
and
drew
a
breath
of
relief
blessing
the
encounter
that
he
had
just
cursed
for
a
road
of
escape
from
his
present
difficulty
began
to
open
before
him
he
must
take
to
his
own
feet
on
the
other
side
of
brechin
and
go
straight
to
the
he
would
be
close
to
montrose
in
communication
with
it
though
not
within
the
precincts
of
the
town
and
safe
from
the
chance
of
running
against
logie
balnillo
and
his
brother
would
not
know
what
had
become
of
him
and
christian
flemington
would
be
cured
of
her
suspicions
by
the
simple
testimony
of
his
whereabouts
he
would
treat
the
two
days
that
he
had
spent
at
the
judge
house
as
if
they
had
dropped
out
of
his
life
and
merely
report
his
late
presence
in
montrose
to
the
captain
of
the
sloop
he
would
describe
his
watching
of
the
two
men
who
came
out
of
happy
land
and
how
he
had
followed
them
to
the
harbour
through
the
darkness
how
he
had
seen
them
stop
opposite
the
ship
light
as
they
discussed
their
plans
how
he
had
tried
to
secure
the
paper
they
held
he
would
tell
the
captain
that
he
believed
some
design
against
the
ship
to
be
on
foot
but
he
would
not
let
logie
name
pass
his
lips
and
he
would
deny
any
knowledge
of
the
identity
of
either
man
lest
the
mention
of
ferrier
should
confirm
the
suspicions
of
those
who
guessed
he
was
working
with
james
when
he
had
reported
himself
to
perth
from
the
ship
he
would
no
longer
be
brought
into
contact
with
skirling
wattie
which
at
that
moment
struck
him
as
an
advantage
the
evenings
had
begun
to
close
in
early
as
he
crossed
the
esk
bridge
and
walked
out
of
brechin
the
dusk
was
enwrapping
its
parapet
like
a
veil
he
hurried
on
and
struck
out
along
the
road
that
would
lead
him
to
ferryden
by
the
southern
shore
of
the
basin
his
way
ran
up
a
long
ascent
and
when
he
stood
at
the
top
of
the
hill
the
outline
of
the
moon
disc
was
rising
faint
behind
the
thin
cloudy
bank
that
rested
on
the
sea
beyond
montrose
there
was
just
enough
daylight
left
to
show
him
the
basin
lying
between
him
and
the
broken
line
of
the
twinkling
lights
under
the
muffled
moon
it
was
quite
dark
when
he
stood
at
last
within
hail
of
the
as
he
went
along
the
bank
at
the
esk
mouth
he
could
see
before
him
the
cluster
of
houses
that
formed
ferryden
village
and
the
north
sea
beyond
it
a
formless
void
in
the
night
with
the
tide
far
out
though
the
moon
was
well
up
the
had
risen
with
her
and
taken
all
sharpness
out
of
the
atmosphere
at
his
left
hand
the
water
crawled
slithering
at
the
foot
of
the
sloping
bank
like
a
dark
snake
and
not
thirty
yards
out
just
where
it
broadened
stretching
to
the
quays
of
montrose
the
vessel
lay
at
anchor
a
stationary
blot
on
the
slow
movement
upstream
between
her
and
the
basin
the
island
of
inchbrayock
split
the
mass
of
water
into
two
portions
flemington
halted
taking
in
the
dark
scene
which
he
had
contemplated
from
its
reverse
side
only
a
few
nights
ago
then
he
went
down
to
the
water
and
put
his
hands
round
his
mouth
ahoy
he
shouted
there
was
no
movement
on
the
ship
he
waited
and
then
called
again
with
the
same
result
through
an
open
porthole
came
a
man
laugh
sudden
as
though
provoked
by
some
unexpected
jest
the
water
was
deep
here
and
the
ship
lay
so
near
that
every
word
was
carried
across
it
to
the
shore
the
laugh
exasperated
him
he
threw
all
the
power
of
his
lungs
into
another
shout
who
goes
there
said
a
voice
friend
replied
archie
and
fearing
to
be
asked
for
a
countersign
he
called
quickly
despatches
for
captain
hall
captain
hall
is
ashore
announced
a
second
voice
and
no
one
boards
us
till
he
returns
the
was
near
enough
to
the
bank
for
archie
to
hear
some
derisive
comment
the
words
of
which
he
could
not
completely
distinguish
a
suppressed
laugh
followed
damn
it
he
cried
am
i
to
be
kept
here
all
night
like
enough
if
you
mean
to
wait
for
the
captain
this
reply
came
from
the
open
porthole
in
which
the
light
was
obliterated
by
the
head
of
the
man
who
spoke
there
was
a
sound
as
of
someone
pulling
him
back
by
the
heels
and
the
port
was
an
eye
of
light
again
flemington
turned
and
went
up
the
bank
and
as
he
reached
the
top
and
sprang
on
to
the
path
he
ran
into
a
short
stoutish
figure
which
was
beginning
to
descend
an
impatient
expletive
burst
from
it
you
need
hurry
sir
said
archie
as
the
other
hailed
the
vessel
querulously
you
are
not
likely
to
get
on
board
what
what
not
board
my
own
ship
flemington
was
a
good
deal
taken
aback
he
could
not
see
much
in
the
clouded
night
but
no
impression
of
authority
seemed
to
emanate
from
the
indistinguishable
person
beside
him
ten
thousand
pardons
sir
exclaimed
the
young
man
you
are
captain
hall
i
have
information
for
you
and
am
sent
by
his
intelligence
officer
in
perth
to
report
myself
to
you
flemington
is
my
name
for
a
minute
the
little
man
said
nothing
and
archie
felt
rather
than
saw
his
fidgety
movements
he
seemed
to
be
hesitating
a
boat
was
being
put
off
from
the
ship
she
lay
so
near
to
them
that
a
mere
push
from
her
side
brought
the
craft
almost
into
the
bank
it
is
so
dark
that
i
must
show
you
my
credentials
on
board
said
archie
taking
captain
hall
acquiescence
for
granted
he
heard
his
companion
drawing
in
his
breath
nervously
through
his
teeth
no
opposition
was
made
as
he
stepped
into
the
boat
when
he
stood
on
deck
beside
hall
the
ship
was
quiet
and
the
sounds
of
laughter
were
silent
he
had
the
feeling
that
everyone
on
board
had
got
out
of
the
way
on
purpose
as
he
followed
the
captain
down
the
companion
to
his
cabin
as
the
latter
opened
the
door
the
light
within
revealed
him
plainly
for
the
first
time
he
was
a
small
man
whose
furtive
eyes
were
set
very
close
to
a
aquiline
nose
his
gait
was
remarkable
because
he
trotted
rather
than
walked
his
restless
fingers
rubbed
one
another
as
he
spoke
he
looked
peevish
and
a
little
dissipated
and
his
manner
conveyed
the
idea
that
he
felt
himself
to
have
no
business
where
he
was
as
archie
remarked
that
he
told
himself
that
it
was
a
characteristic
he
had
never
yet
seen
in
a
seaman
his
dress
was
careless
and
a
on
his
cravat
caught
his
companion
eye
he
had
the
personality
of
a
rabbit
hall
did
not
sit
down
but
stood
at
the
farther
side
of
the
table
looking
with
a
kind
of
grudging
intentness
at
his
guest
and
flemington
was
inclined
to
laugh
in
spite
of
the
heavy
heart
he
had
carried
all
day
the
other
moved
about
with
undecided
steps
when
at
last
he
sat
down
just
under
the
swinging
lamp
archie
was
certain
that
though
he
could
be
called
sober
he
had
been
drinking
your
business
sir
he
began
in
a
husky
voice
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
fatigued
i
had
hoped
to
go
to
bed
in
peace
he
paused
leaning
back
and
surveyed
flemington
with
injured
distaste
there
is
no
reason
that
you
should
not
replied
archie
boldly
i
have
had
a
devilish
hard
day
myself
give
me
a
corner
to
lie
in
and
i
will
give
you
the
details
of
my
report
quickly
he
saw
that
he
would
meet
with
no
opposition
from
hall
whose
one
idea
was
to
spare
himself
effort
and
that
his
own
quarters
on
board
the
were
sure
no
doubt
long
practice
had
enabled
the
man
to
look
less
muddled
than
he
felt
he
sat
down
opposite
to
him
the
other
put
out
his
hand
as
though
to
ward
him
off
i
have
no
leisure
for
business
he
said
this
is
not
the
time
for
it
all
the
same
i
have
orders
from
perth
to
report
myself
to
you
as
i
have
told
you
already
said
archie
if
you
will
listen
i
will
try
to
make
myself
clear
without
troubling
you
to
read
anything
i
have
information
to
give
which
you
should
hear
at
once
i
tell
you
that
i
can
not
attend
to
you
said
hall
i
shall
not
keep
you
long
you
do
not
realize
that
it
is
important
sir
am
i
to
be
dictated
to
exclaimed
the
other
raising
his
voice
this
is
my
own
ship
flem
fling
fl
the
name
presented
so
much
difficulty
to
hall
that
it
died
away
in
a
tangled
murmur
and
archie
saw
that
to
try
to
make
him
understand
anything
important
in
his
present
state
would
be
labour
lost
well
sir
said
he
i
will
tell
you
at
once
that
i
suspect
an
attack
on
you
is
brewing
in
montrose
i
believe
that
it
may
happen
at
any
moment
having
delivered
myself
of
that
i
had
best
leave
you
the
word
attack
found
its
way
to
the
captain
brain
it
impossible
he
exclaimed
crossly
why
plague
o
i
got
all
the
town
guns
nonsense
sir
come
i
will
call
for
a
bottle
of
wine
you
can
go
there
an
empty
bunk
i
the
order
was
given
and
the
wine
was
brought
archie
noticed
that
the
man
who
set
the
bottle
and
the
two
glasses
on
the
table
threw
a
casual
look
at
hall
hand
which
shook
as
he
helped
his
guest
he
had
eaten
little
since
morning
and
drunk
less
now
that
he
had
attained
his
object
and
found
himself
in
temporary
shelter
and
temporary
peace
be
realized
how
glad
he
was
of
the
wine
when
after
a
single
glassful
he
rose
to
follow
the
sailor
who
came
to
show
him
his
bunk
he
turned
to
bid
to
hall
the
light
hanging
above
the
captain
head
revealed
every
line
every
contour
of
his
face
with
merciless
candour
and
flemington
could
see
that
no
lover
counting
the
minutes
till
he
should
be
left
with
his
mistress
had
ever
longed
more
eagerly
to
be
alone
with
her
than
this
man
longed
to
be
alone
with
the
bottle
before
him
archie
threw
himself
thankfully
into
his
bunk
there
was
evidently
room
for
him
on
the
ship
for
there
was
no
trace
of
another
occupant
in
the
little
cabin
nevertheless
it
looked
untidy
and
unswept
the
port
close
to
which
he
lay
was
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
vessel
and
looked
across
the
strait
towards
the
town
the
lamps
were
nearly
all
extinguished
on
the
quays
and
only
here
and
there
a
yellow
spot
of
light
made
a
faint
ladder
in
the
water
the
pleasant
trickling
sound
outside
was
soothing
with
its
impersonal
monotonous
whisper
he
wondered
how
long
hall
would
sit
bemusing
himself
at
the
table
and
what
the
discipline
of
a
ship
commanded
by
this
curiously
ineffective
personality
could
be
he
must
make
out
his
story
to
the
little
man
he
could
not
reproach
himself
with
having
postponed
his
report
for
he
knew
that
hall
brain
which
might
possibly
be
clearer
in
the
morning
was
incapable
of
taking
in
any
but
the
simplest
impressions
tired
as
he
was
he
did
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
the
scenes
of
the
past
few
days
ran
through
his
head
one
after
another
now
they
appeared
unreal
now
almost
visible
to
his
eyes
sometimes
the
space
of
time
they
covered
seemed
sometimes
a
passing
flash
this
was
saturday
night
and
all
the
events
that
had
culminated
in
the
disjointing
of
his
life
had
been
crowded
into
it
since
monday
on
monday
he
had
not
suspected
what
lay
in
himself
he
would
have
gibed
had
he
been
told
that
another
man
personality
a
page
out
of
another
man
history
could
play
such
havoc
with
his
own
interests
he
wondered
what
james
was
doing
was
he
now
over
there
in
the
darkness
looking
across
the
rolling
water
straight
to
the
spot
on
which
he
lay
would
he
could
space
be
obliterated
and
night
illumined
look
up
to
find
his
steady
eyes
upon
him
he
lay
quiet
marvelling
speculating
then
logie
the
shadowy
town
the
burning
of
balnillo
the
tulips
round
the
house
in
holland
fell
away
from
his
mind
and
in
their
place
was
the
familiar
background
of
ardguys
the
ardguys
of
his
childhood
with
the
figure
of
madam
flemington
confronting
him
that
terrible
unsparing
presence
wrapped
about
with
something
greater
and
more
arresting
than
mere
beauty
the
quality
that
had
wrought
on
him
since
he
was
a
little
lad
he
turned
about
with
a
convulsive
breath
that
was
almost
a
sob
then
at
last
he
slept
soundly
to
be
awakened
just
at
dawn
by
the
roar
of
a
gun
followed
by
a
rattle
of
small
shot
and
the
frantic
hurrying
of
feet
overhead
chapter
xi
the
guns
of
montrose
when
archie
lay
and
pictured
james
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
his
vision
was
a
true
one
but
while
he
saw
him
on
the
quay
among
the
sheds
and
windlasses
he
had
set
him
in
the
wrong
place
james
stood
at
the
point
of
the
bay
formed
by
the
basin
of
montrose
at
the
inner
and
landward
side
of
the
town
not
far
from
the
empty
fort
from
which
hall
had
taken
the
guns
the
sands
at
his
feet
were
bare
for
the
tide
was
out
and
the
salt
wet
smell
of
the
oozing
weed
blew
round
him
on
the
faint
wind
he
was
waiting
for
ferrier
they
had
chosen
this
night
as
at
this
hour
the
ebbing
water
would
make
it
possible
for
the
hundred
men
of
ferrier
regiment
to
keep
clear
of
the
roads
and
to
make
their
way
from
brechin
on
the
secluded
shore
of
the
basin
logie
had
not
been
there
long
when
he
heard
the
soft
sound
of
coming
feet
and
the
occasional
knocking
of
shoes
against
stone
as
an
increasing
shadow
took
shape
he
struck
his
hand
twice
against
his
thigh
and
the
shadow
grew
still
he
struck
again
and
in
another
minute
ferrier
was
beside
him
the
soldiers
who
followed
halted
behind
their
leader
the
two
men
said
little
to
each
other
but
moved
on
side
by
side
and
the
small
company
wound
up
the
rising
slope
of
the
shore
to
the
deserted
fort
and
gathered
at
its
foot
james
and
his
friend
went
on
a
little
way
and
stood
looking
east
down
the
townward
shore
of
the
strait
past
the
huddled
houses
massed
together
at
this
end
of
montrose
the
water
slid
to
the
sea
and
halfway
down
the
long
quay
in
front
of
them
was
moored
the
unrigged
barque
that
held
the
town
guns
the
and
that
had
pointed
their
muzzles
for
so
many
years
from
the
fort
walls
towards
the
thundering
bar
hall
had
not
concerned
himself
to
bring
the
vessel
into
his
own
immediate
neighbourhood
nor
even
to
put
a
few
dozen
yards
of
water
between
her
and
the
shore
he
knew
that
no
organized
rebel
force
existed
within
nine
miles
of
where
she
lay
and
that
the
jacobites
among
the
townsmen
could
not
attempt
any
hostile
movement
unaided
he
had
eighty
men
on
board
the
with
him
and
from
them
he
had
taken
a
small
guard
which
was
left
in
charge
of
the
barque
every
two
or
three
days
he
would
send
a
party
from
the
sloop
to
patrol
the
streets
of
montrose
and
to
impress
disloyally
inclined
people
his
own
investigations
of
the
place
had
not
been
great
for
though
he
went
ashore
a
good
deal
it
can
not
be
said
that
king
interests
were
much
furthered
by
his
doings
when
he
got
there
when
logie
and
ferrier
had
posted
a
handful
of
men
in
the
empty
fort
they
went
on
towards
the
barque
moorings
followed
by
the
rest
and
leaving
a
few
to
guard
the
mouth
of
each
street
that
opened
on
the
quay
the
whole
world
was
abed
behind
the
darkened
windows
and
the
grim
stone
walls
that
brooded
like
blind
faces
over
the
stealthy
band
passing
below
when
they
reached
the
spot
where
the
lay
that
plied
between
montrose
and
the
south
shore
of
the
strait
two
men
went
down
to
the
and
detaching
her
chains
got
her
ready
to
push
off
then
with
no
more
delay
the
friends
pressed
on
to
the
main
business
of
their
expedition
as
they
neared
the
barque
a
faint
shine
forward
where
her
bows
pointed
seaward
suggested
that
someone
on
board
was
waking
so
judging
it
best
to
make
the
attack
before
an
alarm
could
be
given
the
two
captains
ran
on
with
their
men
and
were
climbing
over
the
bulwarks
and
tumbling
on
to
her
deck
before
captain
hall
guard
who
were
playing
cards
round
a
lantern
had
time
to
collect
their
senses
the
three
players
sprang
to
their
feet
and
one
of
them
sent
a
loud
cry
ringing
into
the
darkness
before
he
sprawled
senseless
with
his
head
laid
open
by
the
of
ferrier
pistol
in
this
onslaught
that
had
come
upon
them
as
suddenly
as
the
swoop
of
a
squall
in
a
treacherous
sea
they
struck
blindly
about
stumbling
into
the
arms
of
the
swarming
unrecognized
figures
that
had
poured
in
on
their
security
out
of
the
peaceful
night
james
had
kicked
over
the
lantern
and
the
cards
lay
scattered
about
under
foot
white
spots
in
the
dimness
the
bank
of
cloud
was
thinning
a
little
round
the
moon
and
the
angles
of
the
objects
on
deck
began
to
be
more
clearly
blocked
out
one
of
the
three
who
had
contrived
to
wrench
himself
from
his
assailant
hold
sprang
away
and
raced
towards
the
of
the
ship
where
with
the
carelessness
of
security
he
had
left
his
musket
three
successive
shots
was
the
signal
for
help
from
the
in
case
of
emergency
and
he
made
a
gallant
effort
to
get
free
to
send
this
sign
of
distress
across
the
strait
but
he
was
headed
back
and
overpowered
before
he
could
carry
out
his
intention
one
of
his
companions
was
lying
as
if
dead
on
the
deck
and
the
other
who
had
been
cajoled
to
silence
by
the
suggestive
caress
of
a
pistol
at
the
back
of
his
ear
was
having
his
arms
bound
behind
him
with
his
own
belt
not
a
shot
had
been
fired
except
for
that
one
cry
from
the
man
who
lay
so
still
at
their
feet
no
sound
but
the
scuffling
and
cursing
on
the
barque
disturbed
the
quiet
ferrier
men
hustled
their
prisoners
below
into
the
cabin
where
they
were
gagged
and
secured
and
left
under
the
charge
of
a
couple
of
soldiers
no
roving
citizen
troubled
the
neighbourhood
at
this
hour
for
the
of
montrose
looked
farther
inland
for
their
entertainment
and
the
who
were
the
principal
dwellers
in
the
poor
houses
skirting
the
quays
slept
sound
and
recked
little
of
who
might
be
quarrelling
out
of
doors
so
long
as
they
lay
warm
within
them
the
barque
was
some
way
from
the
general
throng
of
shipping
apart
and
as
hall
had
thought
the
more
safe
for
that
for
his
calculations
had
taken
no
count
of
an
enemy
who
might
come
from
anywhere
but
the
town
he
had
never
dreamed
of
the
silent
band
which
had
been
yielded
up
by
the
misty
stretches
of
the
basin
james
leaned
over
the
vessel
side
towards
the
and
thought
of
captain
hall
he
had
seen
him
in
a
tavern
of
the
town
and
had
been
as
little
impressed
by
his
looks
as
was
flemington
he
had
noticed
the
uncertain
eye
the
restless
fingers
the
trotting
gait
and
had
held
him
lightly
as
a
force
for
he
knew
as
well
as
most
men
know
who
have
knocked
about
this
world
that
character
none
other
is
the
hammer
that
drives
home
every
nail
into
the
framework
of
achievement
but
he
had
no
time
to
spend
in
speculations
for
his
interest
was
centred
in
the
that
was
now
slipping
noiselessly
towards
them
on
the
current
guided
by
the
couple
of
soldiers
who
had
unmoored
her
as
she
reached
the
barque
a
rope
was
tossed
down
to
her
and
she
was
made
fast
the
stolen
guns
were
hauled
from
their
storage
and
a
lowered
with
its
ammunition
into
the
great
tub
that
scarcely
heaved
on
the
slow
swirl
of
the
river
and
whilst
the
work
was
going
on
ferrier
and
james
stepped
ashore
to
the
quay
and
walked
each
a
short
way
along
it
watching
for
any
movement
or
for
the
chance
of
surprise
there
was
nothing
only
from
far
out
beyond
the
shipping
a
soft
rush
so
low
that
it
seemed
to
be
part
of
the
atmosphere
itself
told
that
the
tide
was
on
the
turn
in
the
enshrouding
night
the
boat
was
loaded
and
a
dozen
or
so
of
the
little
company
pushed
off
with
their
spoil
ferrier
went
with
them
and
logie
who
was
to
follow
with
the
second
gun
watched
the
craft
making
her
way
into
obscurity
like
some
slow
black
river
monster
pushing
blindly
out
into
space
the
scheme
he
had
been
putting
together
since
the
arrival
of
the
was
taking
reality
at
last
and
though
he
could
stand
with
folded
arms
on
the
bulwark
looking
calmly
at
the
departing
boat
the
fire
in
his
heart
burned
hot
custom
had
inured
him
to
risks
of
every
kind
and
if
his
keenness
of
enterprise
was
the
same
as
it
had
been
in
youth
the
excitement
of
youth
had
evaporated
it
was
the
depths
that
stirred
in
logie
seldom
the
surface
like
archie
flemington
he
loved
life
but
he
loved
it
differently
flemington
loved
it
consciously
joyously
pictorially
james
loved
it
desperately
so
desperately
that
his
spirit
had
survived
the
shock
which
had
robbed
it
of
its
glory
for
him
he
was
like
a
faithful
lover
whose
mistress
has
been
scarred
by
smallpox
he
could
throw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
the
stuart
cause
its
details
and
necessities
all
that
his
support
of
it
entailed
upon
him
because
it
had
so
to
speak
given
him
his
second
wind
in
the
race
of
life
though
he
was
an
adventurer
by
nature
he
differed
from
the
average
adventurer
in
that
he
sought
nothing
for
himself
he
did
not
conform
to
the
average
adventuring
type
he
was
too
overwhelmingly
masculine
to
be
a
dangler
about
women
though
since
the
shipwreck
of
his
youth
he
had
more
than
once
followed
in
the
train
of
some
complaisant
goddess
and
had
reaped
all
the
benefits
of
her
notice
he
was
no
snatcher
at
casual
advantages
but
a
man
to
whom
service
in
any
interest
meant
solid
effort
and
unsparing
sacrifice
also
he
was
one
who
seldom
looked
back
he
had
done
so
once
lately
and
the
act
had
shaken
him
to
the
heart
perhaps
he
would
do
so
oftener
when
he
had
wrought
out
the
permanent
need
of
action
that
lay
at
the
foundation
of
his
nature
when
the
boat
had
come
back
silent
on
the
outflowing
river
and
had
taken
her
second
load
he
lowered
himself
into
the
stern
as
her
head
was
pulled
round
again
towards
inchbrayock
the
scheme
fashioned
by
the
two
men
for
the
capture
of
the
vessel
depended
for
its
success
on
their
possession
of
this
island
as
soon
as
they
should
land
on
it
they
were
to
entrench
the
two
guns
one
on
its
side
as
near
to
the
as
possible
and
the
other
on
its
northern
shore
facing
the
quays
by
this
means
the
small
party
would
command
not
only
the
ship
but
the
whole
breadth
of
the
river
and
its
and
would
be
able
to
stop
communication
between
captain
hall
and
the
town
heavy
undergrowth
covered
a
fair
portion
of
inchbrayock
and
the
only
buildings
upon
it
if
buildings
they
could
be
called
were
the
walls
of
an
old
graveyard
and
the
stones
and
crosses
they
encircled
though
the
island
lay
at
a
convenient
part
of
the
strait
no
bridge
connected
it
with
montrose
and
those
who
wished
to
cross
the
esk
at
that
point
were
obliged
to
use
the
ferry
the
channel
dividing
its
southern
shore
from
the
mainland
being
comparatively
narrow
a
row
of
gigantic
carried
wayfarers
across
its
bed
for
at
low
tide
there
was
a
mere
streak
of
water
curling
through
the
mud
when
the
guns
were
got
safely
into
position
on
the
island
it
was
decided
that
ferrier
was
to
return
to
the
barque
and
take
the
remaining
with
all
despatch
to
a
piece
of
rising
ground
called
dial
hill
that
overlooked
the
mass
of
shipping
opposite
ferryden
he
did
not
expect
to
meet
with
much
opposition
should
news
of
his
action
be
carried
to
the
town
for
its
main
sympathies
were
with
his
side
and
the
force
on
the
government
vessel
would
be
prevented
from
coming
over
the
strait
to
oppose
him
until
he
was
settled
on
his
eminence
by
the
powerful
dissuaders
he
had
left
behind
him
on
inchbrayock
he
was
to
begin
firing
from
dial
hill
at
dawn
and
james
who
was
near
enough
to
the
to
see
any
movement
that
might
take
place
on
her
was
to
be
ready
with
his
fire
and
with
his
small
party
of
marksmen
to
check
any
offensive
force
despatched
from
the
ship
to
the
quays
hall
would
thus
be
cut
off
from
the
town
by
the
fire
from
inchbrayock
on
the
one
hand
and
should
he
attempt
a
landing
nearer
to
the
watermouth
by
the
guns
on
dial
hill
on
the
other
james
had
placed
himself
advantageously
the
thicket
of
elder
and
thorn
which
had
engulfed
one
end
of
the
made
excellent
concealment
and
in
front
of
him
was
the
solid
wall
through
a
gap
in
which
he
had
turned
the
muzzle
of
his
he
sat
on
the
stump
of
a
his
head
in
his
hands
waiting
as
he
knew
he
would
have
to
wait
for
some
time
yet
till
the
first
round
from
dial
hill
should
be
the
signal
for
his
own
attack
the
moon
had
made
her
journey
by
this
hour
and
while
she
had
been
caught
in
her
course
through
the
zenith
in
the
web
of
cloud
and
mist
that
thickened
the
sky
she
was
now
descending
towards
her
rest
through
a
clear
stretch
she
swung
as
though
suspended
above
the
basin
tilted
on
her
back
and
a
little
yellower
as
she
neared
the
earth
a
dying
thing
halfway
through
her
second
quarter
james
looking
up
could
see
her
between
the
arms
of
the
crosses
and
the
leaning
stones
the
strangeness
of
the
place
arrested
his
thoughts
and
turned
them
into
unusual
tracks
for
though
far
from
being
an
unimaginative
man
he
was
little
given
to
deliberate
contemplation
the
distant
inland
water
under
the
lighted
half
disc
was
pale
and
a
faintness
seemed
to
lie
upon
the
earth
in
this
hour
between
night
and
morning
his
thoughts
went
to
the
only
dwellers
on
inchbrayock
those
who
were
lying
under
his
feet
seamen
for
the
most
part
and
who
had
known
the
fury
of
the
north
sea
that
was
now
beginning
to
crawl
in
and
to
surround
them
in
their
little
township
with
its
insidious
arms
encircling
in
death
the
bodies
that
had
escaped
it
in
life
some
of
them
had
been
far
afield
farther
than
he
had
ever
been
in
spite
of
all
his
campaigns
but
they
had
come
in
over
the
bar
to
lie
here
in
the
jaws
of
the
outflowing
river
by
their
native
town
he
wondered
whether
he
should
do
the
same
times
were
so
uncertain
now
that
he
might
well
take
the
road
into
the
world
again
the
question
of
where
his
bones
should
lie
was
a
matter
of
no
great
interest
to
him
and
though
there
was
a
vague
restfulness
in
the
notion
of
coming
at
last
to
the
slopes
and
shadows
of
balnillo
he
knew
that
the
wideness
of
the
world
was
his
natural
home
then
he
thought
of
after
a
while
he
raised
his
head
again
roused
not
by
the
streak
of
light
that
was
growing
upon
the
east
but
by
a
shot
that
shattered
the
silence
and
sent
the
echoes
rolling
out
from
dial
hill
chapter
xii
inchbrayock
archie
sprang
up
unable
for
a
moment
to
remember
where
he
was
he
was
almost
in
darkness
for
the
port
looked
northward
and
the
pale
light
barely
glimmered
through
it
but
he
could
just
see
a
spurt
of
white
leap
into
the
air
midway
across
the
channel
where
a
second
shot
had
struck
the
water
as
he
rushed
on
deck
a
puff
of
smoke
was
dispersing
above
dial
hill
then
another
cloud
rolled
from
the
bushes
on
the
nearest
point
of
inchbrayock
island
and
he
felt
the
shiver
and
move
in
her
moorings
captain
hall
voice
was
rising
above
the
scuffling
and
running
that
was
going
on
all
over
the
ship
and
the
dragging
about
of
heavy
objects
was
making
the
decks
shake
he
went
below
and
begun
to
hustle
on
his
clothes
for
the
morning
air
struck
chill
and
he
felt
the
need
of
being
ready
for
action
of
some
kind
in
a
few
minutes
he
came
up
warily
and
crept
round
to
the
port
side
taking
what
cover
he
could
then
a
roar
burst
from
the
side
of
the
as
she
opened
fire
he
stood
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
himself
it
was
dreadful
to
him
to
have
to
be
inactive
whilst
his
blood
rose
with
the
excitement
round
him
no
one
on
the
vessel
remembered
his
existence
he
was
like
a
stray
dog
in
a
thrust
aside
by
every
passer
brushing
by
on
the
business
of
life
it
was
soon
evident
that
though
the
guns
on
the
hill
commanded
the
their
shot
was
falling
short
of
her
as
the
sun
heaved
up
from
beyond
the
bar
the
quays
over
the
water
could
be
seen
filling
with
people
and
the
town
bells
began
to
ring
an
increasing
crowd
swarmed
upon
the
of
the
ferry
but
the
boat
herself
had
been
brought
by
james
to
the
shore
of
inchbrayock
and
nobody
was
likely
to
cross
the
water
whilst
the
island
and
the
high
ground
seaward
of
the
town
was
held
by
the
invisible
enemy
which
had
come
upon
them
from
heaven
knew
where
captain
hall
was
turning
his
attention
exclusively
on
inchbrayock
and
flemington
who
had
got
nearer
to
the
place
where
he
stood
gathered
from
what
he
could
hear
that
the
man
on
dial
hill
was
wasting
his
ammunition
on
a
target
that
was
out
of
range
a
shot
from
the
vessel
had
torn
up
a
shower
of
earth
in
the
bank
that
sloped
from
the
thicket
to
the
and
another
had
struck
one
of
the
gravestones
on
the
island
splitting
it
in
two
but
the
fire
went
on
steadily
from
the
dense
tangle
where
the
churchyard
wall
no
doubt
concealed
earthworks
that
had
risen
behind
it
in
the
dark
hours
this
then
was
the
outcome
of
with
ferrier
archie
contemplated
captain
hall
where
he
stood
in
a
little
group
of
men
he
looked
even
less
of
a
personage
in
the
morning
light
than
he
had
done
in
the
cabin
and
the
young
man
suspected
that
he
had
gone
to
bed
in
his
clothes
this
reminded
him
that
he
himself
was
unwashed
unshaven
and
very
hungry
whatsoever
the
issue
of
the
attack
might
be
there
was
no
use
in
remaining
starved
and
dirty
and
he
determined
to
go
below
to
forage
and
to
find
some
means
of
washing
there
was
no
one
to
gainsay
him
at
this
time
of
stress
and
he
walked
into
cabin
reflecting
that
he
might
safely
steal
anything
he
could
carry
from
the
ship
if
he
were
so
minded
and
slip
overboard
across
the
narrow
arm
to
the
bank
with
nothing
worse
than
a
wetting
whilst
he
was
attending
to
his
own
necessities
the
booming
went
on
overhead
and
at
last
a
shout
from
above
sent
him
racing
up
from
the
welcome
food
he
had
contrived
to
secure
the
wall
on
inchbrayock
was
shattered
in
two
or
three
places
and
the
unseen
gun
was
silent
the
cannonade
from
dial
hill
had
stopped
but
a
train
of
figures
was
hurrying
across
from
the
northern
shore
of
the
island
taking
shelter
among
the
bushes
and
stones
a
boat
was
being
lowered
from
the
for
the
tide
now
sweeping
in
had
covered
the
mud
making
a
landing
possible
men
were
crowding
into
her
and
as
flemington
got
round
to
his
former
place
of
observation
she
was
being
pushed
off
hall
who
was
standing
alone
caught
sight
of
him
and
came
towards
him
his
face
looked
swollen
and
puffy
and
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
we
have
been
attacked
he
began
attacked
most
unexpectedly
i
had
the
honour
to
report
that
possibility
to
you
last
night
sir
replied
flemington
with
a
trifle
of
insolence
in
his
manner
an
angry
look
shot
out
of
hall
rabbit
eyes
what
could
you
possibly
have
known
about
such
a
thing
he
cried
what
reason
had
you
for
making
such
a
statement
i
had
a
great
many
said
archie
but
you
informed
me
that
you
had
no
leisure
to
listen
to
any
of
them
until
this
morning
perhaps
you
are
at
leisure
now
you
are
a
damned
impudent
scoundrel
cried
the
other
noticing
flemington
expression
which
amply
justified
these
words
but
you
had
better
take
care
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
me
from
putting
you
under
arrest
nothing
but
the
orders
i
carry
in
my
pocket
replied
archie
they
are
likely
enough
to
deter
you
the
other
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
before
he
could
do
so
a
shot
crashed
into
the
fore
part
of
the
ship
and
a
hail
of
bullets
ripped
out
from
the
thicket
on
the
island
the
boat
which
was
between
the
and
inchbrayock
spun
round
and
two
of
the
rowers
fell
forward
over
their
oars
hall
left
archie
standing
where
he
was
the
gun
that
the
ship
gunners
believed
themselves
to
have
disabled
had
opened
fire
again
after
a
silence
that
had
been
perhaps
but
a
lure
to
draw
a
sortie
from
her
and
as
it
was
mere
destruction
for
the
boat
to
attempt
a
landing
in
the
face
of
the
shot
she
had
orders
to
put
back
the
position
in
which
he
was
placed
was
now
becoming
clear
to
hall
he
was
cut
off
from
communication
with
the
quays
by
the
guns
safely
entrenched
on
the
island
and
those
on
dial
hill
though
out
of
range
for
the
moment
would
prevent
him
from
moving
nearer
to
the
watermouth
or
making
an
attempt
to
get
out
to
sea
he
could
not
tell
what
was
happening
in
the
town
opposite
and
he
had
no
means
of
finding
out
for
the
whole
of
the
cannon
that
he
had
been
mad
enough
to
leave
by
the
shore
was
in
the
enemy
possession
and
would
remain
so
unless
the
townspeople
should
rise
in
the
government
interest
for
their
recapture
this
he
was
well
aware
they
would
not
do
his
resentment
against
his
luck
and
the
voice
within
which
told
him
that
he
had
nothing
to
thank
for
it
but
his
own
carelessness
grew
more
insistent
as
his
head
grew
clearer
he
had
been
jerked
out
of
sleep
and
with
a
brain
still
dulled
by
drink
but
the
morning
freshness
worked
on
him
and
the
sun
warmed
his
senses
into
activity
the
sight
of
flemington
clean
impertinent
and
entirely
comprehensive
of
the
circumstances
drove
him
mad
and
it
drove
him
still
madder
to
know
that
archie
understood
why
he
had
been
unwilling
to
see
his
report
last
night
hall
abilities
were
a
little
superior
to
his
looks
so
far
he
had
served
his
country
not
conspicuously
but
without
disaster
and
had
he
been
able
to
keep
himself
as
sober
as
most
people
contrived
to
be
in
those
intemperate
days
he
might
have
gone
on
his
course
with
the
same
tepid
success
he
was
one
who
liked
the
distractions
of
towns
and
he
bemoaned
the
fate
that
had
sent
him
to
anchor
in
a
dull
creek
of
the
east
coast
where
the
taverns
held
nothing
but
faces
whose
unconcealed
dislike
forbade
conviviality
and
where
even
the
light
women
looked
upon
his
uniform
askance
he
was
not
a
lively
comrade
at
the
best
of
times
and
here
where
he
was
thrown
upon
the
sole
society
of
his
officers
with
whom
he
was
not
popular
he
was
growing
more
morose
and
more
careless
as
his
habits
of
stealthy
excess
grew
upon
him
archie
with
his
quick
judgment
of
his
had
measured
him
accurately
and
he
knew
it
in
the
midst
of
the
morning
disaster
the
presence
of
the
interloper
his
flippant
civility
of
word
and
insolence
of
manner
made
his
sluggish
blood
boil
it
was
plain
that
the
party
on
the
island
must
be
dislodged
before
anything
could
be
done
to
save
the
situation
and
hall
now
decided
to
land
as
large
a
force
as
he
could
spare
upon
the
mainland
by
marching
it
along
the
road
to
ferryden
he
would
give
the
impression
that
some
attempt
was
to
be
made
to
cross
the
strait
nearer
to
the
coast
and
to
land
it
between
dial
hill
and
the
sea
behind
ferryden
village
a
rough
track
turned
sharply
southward
up
the
bank
and
this
they
were
to
take
they
would
be
completely
hidden
from
inchbrayock
once
they
had
got
over
the
crest
of
the
land
and
they
were
to
double
back
with
all
speed
along
the
mainland
under
shelter
of
the
ridge
and
to
go
for
about
a
mile
parallel
with
the
basin
when
they
had
got
well
to
the
westward
side
of
the
island
they
were
to
wheel
down
to
the
shore
at
a
spot
where
a
grove
of
trees
edged
the
brink
for
here
in
a
sheltering
turn
of
backwater
among
the
trunks
and
roots
a
few
boats
were
moored
for
the
convenience
of
those
who
wished
to
cross
straight
to
montrose
by
water
instead
of
taking
the
usual
path
by
the
over
inchbrayock
island
they
were
to
embark
at
this
place
and
hugging
the
shore
under
cover
of
its
irregularities
to
approach
inchbrayock
from
the
west
if
they
should
succeed
in
landing
unseen
they
would
surprise
the
enemy
at
the
further
side
of
the
graveyard
whilst
his
attention
was
turned
on
the
the
officer
to
be
sent
in
command
of
the
party
believed
it
could
be
done
because
the
length
of
the
island
would
intervene
to
hide
their
manoeuvres
from
the
town
where
the
citizens
crowding
on
the
quays
would
be
only
too
ready
to
direct
the
notice
of
the
rebels
to
their
approach
as
the
boat
put
off
from
the
ship
archie
slipped
into
it
he
seemed
to
have
lost
his
definite
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
during
the
last
hours
he
was
nobody
servant
nobody
master
concern
and
in
spite
of
his
bold
reply
to
hall
threat
of
arrest
he
knew
quite
well
that
though
the
captain
would
stop
short
of
such
a
measure
he
might
order
him
below
at
any
moment
the
only
wonder
was
that
he
had
not
done
so
already
he
did
not
know
into
what
hands
he
might
fall
should
hall
be
obliged
to
surrender
and
this
contingency
appeared
to
be
growing
likely
by
tacking
himself
on
to
the
he
would
at
least
have
the
chance
of
action
and
though
having
been
careful
to
keep
out
of
hall
sight
he
had
not
been
able
to
discover
their
destination
he
had
determined
to
land
with
the
men
after
they
had
disembarked
he
went
boldly
up
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
party
and
asked
for
permission
to
go
with
it
and
when
this
was
accorded
with
some
surprise
he
fell
into
step
as
they
tramped
along
towards
ferryden
he
managed
to
pick
up
something
of
the
work
in
hand
from
the
man
next
to
him
his
only
fear
was
of
the
chance
of
running
against
logie
nevertheless
he
made
up
his
mind
to
trust
to
luck
to
save
him
from
that
because
he
believed
that
logie
as
a
professional
soldier
would
be
in
command
of
the
guns
on
the
hill
it
was
from
dial
hill
that
the
tactical
details
of
the
attack
could
best
be
directed
and
if
either
of
the
conspirators
were
upon
the
island
archie
was
convinced
it
would
be
ferrier
they
soon
reached
ferryden
the
sun
was
clear
and
brave
in
the
salt
air
over
the
sea
and
a
flock
of
gulls
was
screaming
out
beyond
the
bar
dipping
hovering
swinging
sideways
against
the
light
breeze
now
this
way
now
that
way
their
wanton
voices
full
of
mockery
as
though
the
derisive
spirits
imprisoned
in
the
ocean
had
become
articulate
and
were
crying
out
on
the
land
the
village
looked
distrustfully
at
the
approach
of
the
small
company
and
some
of
the
dragged
their
children
indoors
as
if
they
thought
to
see
them
kidnapped
such
men
as
were
hanging
about
watched
them
with
sullen
eyes
as
they
turned
in
between
the
houses
and
made
for
the
higher
ground
the
boom
of
the
guns
came
to
them
from
time
to
time
and
once
they
heard
a
great
shout
rise
from
the
quays
but
they
could
see
nothing
because
of
the
intervening
swell
of
the
land
they
passed
a
farm
and
a
few
scattered
cottages
but
these
were
empty
for
their
inmates
had
gone
to
the
likeliest
places
they
could
find
for
a
view
of
what
was
happening
in
the
harbour
presently
they
went
down
to
the
basin
straggling
by
twos
and
threes
at
the
water
edge
a
colony
of
beeches
stood
naked
and
leafless
their
heads
listed
over
westward
by
the
winds
that
swept
up
the
river
mouth
they
were
crowded
thick
about
the
creek
down
which
flemington
and
his
companions
came
and
at
their
feet
tied
to
the
gnarled
elbows
of
the
great
roots
beneath
which
the
water
had
eaten
deep
into
the
bank
lay
three
or
four
boats
with
their
oars
piled
inside
them
the
of
years
had
sunk
into
the
soil
giving
a
curious
mixture
of
heaviness
and
elasticity
to
the
earth
as
it
was
trodden
a
drew
a
ripple
along
the
transparency
below
which
the
undulations
of
the
bottom
lay
like
a
view
of
some
miniature
world
the
quiet
of
this
hidden
echoed
to
the
clank
of
the
rowlocks
as
the
heavy
oars
were
shipped
and
two
boatloads
slid
out
between
the
stems
archie
who
was
unarmed
had
borrowed
one
of
the
officer
pistols
not
so
much
with
the
intention
of
using
it
as
from
the
wish
for
a
plausible
pretext
for
joining
the
party
at
any
time
his
love
of
adventure
would
welcome
such
an
opportunity
and
at
this
moment
he
did
not
care
what
might
happen
to
him
he
seemed
to
have
no
chance
of
being
true
to
anybody
and
it
was
being
revealed
to
him
that
in
these
circumstances
life
was
scarcely
endurable
he
had
never
thought
about
it
before
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
now
it
was
some
small
comfort
to
know
that
should
his
last
of
life
be
spent
on
inchbrayock
madam
flemington
would
at
least
understand
that
she
had
wronged
him
in
suspecting
him
of
being
a
turncoat
if
only
james
could
know
that
he
had
not
betrayed
him
or
rather
that
his
report
was
in
the
hands
of
that
accursed
beggar
before
they
met
among
the
yet
what
if
he
did
know
it
would
his
loathing
of
the
spy
under
the
of
his
brother
house
be
any
the
less
he
would
never
understand
never
know
and
yet
he
had
been
true
to
him
in
his
heart
and
the
fact
that
he
had
now
no
of
his
own
proved
it
they
slipped
in
under
the
bank
of
the
island
and
disembarked
silently
the
higher
ground
in
the
middle
of
it
crossed
their
front
like
the
line
of
an
incoming
wave
hiding
all
that
was
going
on
on
its
farther
side
they
were
to
advance
straight
over
it
and
to
rush
down
upon
the
thicket
where
the
gun
was
entrenched
with
its
muzzle
towards
the
there
was
to
be
no
working
round
the
north
shore
lest
the
hundreds
of
eyes
on
the
quays
should
catch
sight
of
them
and
a
hundred
tongues
give
the
alarm
to
the
rebels
they
were
to
attack
at
once
only
waiting
for
the
sound
of
another
shot
to
locate
the
exact
place
for
which
they
were
to
make
they
stood
drawn
up
waiting
for
the
order
archie
dropped
behind
the
others
his
heart
had
begun
to
sink
he
had
assured
himself
over
and
over
again
that
logie
must
be
on
dial
hill
yet
as
each
moment
brought
him
nearer
to
contact
with
the
enemy
he
felt
cold
misgiving
stealing
on
him
what
if
his
guesses
had
been
wrong
he
knew
that
he
had
been
a
fool
to
run
the
risk
he
had
taken
chance
is
such
a
smiling
deity
when
we
see
her
afar
off
but
when
we
are
well
on
our
steady
plod
towards
her
and
the
distance
lessens
between
us
it
is
often
all
that
we
can
do
to
meet
her
eyes
their
expression
has
changed
archie
willingness
to
take
risks
was
unfailing
and
temperamental
and
he
had
taken
this
one
in
the
usual
spirit
but
so
much
had
happened
lately
to
shake
his
confidence
in
life
and
in
himself
that
his
high
heart
was
beating
slower
never
had
he
dreaded
anything
as
much
as
he
dreaded
knowledge
of
the
truth
yet
the
most
agonizing
part
of
it
all
was
that
james
could
not
know
the
whole
truth
nor
understand
it
even
if
he
knew
it
archie
reading
of
the
other
man
character
was
accurate
enough
to
tell
him
that
no
knowledge
of
facts
could
make
logie
understand
the
part
he
had
played
sick
at
heart
he
stood
back
from
the
party
watching
it
gather
before
the
officer
he
did
not
belong
to
it
no
one
troubled
his
head
about
him
and
the
men
backs
were
towards
him
he
stole
away
sheltered
by
a
little
hillock
and
ran
bent
almost
double
to
the
southern
shore
of
the
island
he
would
creep
round
it
and
get
as
near
as
possible
to
the
thicket
if
he
could
conceal
himself
he
might
be
able
to
see
the
enemy
and
the
enemy
commander
and
to
discover
the
truth
while
there
was
yet
time
for
flight
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
to
see
if
the
officer
had
noticed
his
absence
and
being
reassured
he
pressed
on
he
knew
that
anyone
who
thought
about
him
at
all
would
take
him
for
a
coward
but
he
did
not
reckon
that
the
dread
of
meeting
james
possessed
him
sheep
were
often
brought
over
to
graze
the
island
and
their
tracks
ran
like
network
among
the
bushes
he
trod
softly
in
and
out
anxious
to
get
forward
before
the
next
sound
of
the
gun
should
let
loose
the
upon
the
rebels
he
passed
the
end
of
the
which
crossed
the
esk
bed
to
the
mainland
they
were
now
nearly
submerged
by
the
tide
rising
in
the
river
he
had
not
known
of
their
existence
and
as
he
noticed
them
with
surprise
a
shot
shook
the
air
and
though
the
thicket
now
not
far
before
him
blocked
his
view
of
the
hull
he
saw
the
tops
of
her
masts
tremble
and
knew
that
she
had
been
struck
before
him
the
track
took
a
sharp
turn
round
a
bend
of
the
shore
which
cut
the
path
like
a
little
promontory
so
that
he
could
see
nothing
beyond
it
and
here
he
paused
in
another
few
minutes
the
island
would
be
in
confusion
from
the
attack
and
he
might
discover
nothing
he
set
his
teeth
and
stepped
round
the
corner
the
track
widened
out
and
then
plunged
into
the
fringe
of
the
thicket
a
man
was
kneeling
on
one
knee
with
his
back
to
flemington
his
hands
were
shading
his
eyes
and
he
was
peering
along
a
gap
in
the
branches
through
which
could
be
seen
a
patch
of
river
and
the
damaged
bows
of
the
archie
instinct
was
to
retreat
but
before
he
could
do
so
the
man
jumped
up
and
faced
him
his
heart
leaped
to
his
mouth
for
it
was
james
logie
stood
staring
at
him
then
he
made
a
great
effort
to
pick
up
the
of
recollection
that
he
felt
sure
he
must
have
dropped
he
had
been
so
much
absorbed
in
the
business
in
hand
that
he
found
it
impossible
for
a
moment
to
estimate
the
significance
of
any
outside
matter
though
he
was
confounded
and
disturbed
by
the
apparition
of
the
painter
the
idea
of
hostility
never
entered
his
mind
flemington
he
exclaimed
stepping
towards
him
but
the
other
man
expression
was
so
strange
that
he
stopped
conscious
of
vague
disaster
what
had
the
intruder
come
to
tell
him
as
he
stood
flemington
murmured
something
he
could
not
distinguish
then
turned
quickly
in
his
tracks
logie
leaped
after
him
and
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
before
he
had
time
to
double
round
the
bend
let
me
go
cried
archie
his
chest
heaving
let
me
go
man
but
james
grip
tightened
he
was
a
strong
man
and
he
almost
dragged
him
over
as
he
held
him
he
caught
sight
of
the
government
pistol
in
his
belt
it
was
one
that
the
officer
who
had
lent
it
to
flemington
had
taken
from
the
ship
he
jerked
archie
violently
round
and
made
a
snatch
at
the
weapon
and
the
younger
man
all
but
thrown
off
his
balance
thrust
his
arm
convulsively
into
the
air
his
sleeve
shot
back
laying
bare
a
round
red
spot
outside
the
brown
sinewy
wrist
then
there
flashed
retrospectively
before
james
eye
that
same
wound
bright
in
the
blaze
of
the
flaming
paper
and
with
it
there
flashed
comprehension
his
impulse
was
to
draw
his
own
pistol
and
to
shoot
the
spy
dead
but
archie
recovered
his
balance
and
was
grappling
with
him
so
that
he
could
not
get
his
arm
free
the
strength
of
the
slim
light
young
man
astonished
him
he
was
as
agile
as
a
weasel
but
james
found
in
him
added
to
his
activity
a
force
that
nearly
matched
his
own
there
was
no
possible
doubt
of
logie
complete
enlightenment
though
he
kept
his
crooked
mouth
shut
and
uttered
no
word
his
eyes
wore
an
expression
not
solely
due
to
the
violent
struggle
going
on
they
were
terrible
and
they
woke
the
frantic
instinct
of
in
flemington
he
knew
that
james
was
straining
to
get
out
his
own
pistol
and
he
hung
on
him
and
gripped
him
for
dear
life
as
they
swayed
and
swung
to
and
fro
trampling
the
bents
there
rose
from
behind
the
graveyard
a
yell
that
gathered
and
broke
over
the
sound
of
their
own
quick
breaths
like
a
submerging
flood
and
the
bullets
began
to
whistle
over
the
rising
ground
archie
saw
a
change
come
into
james
eyes
then
he
found
himself
staggering
hurled
with
swift
and
tremendous
force
from
his
antagonist
he
was
flung
headlong
against
the
jutting
bend
round
which
he
had
come
and
his
forehead
struck
it
heavily
then
rolling
down
to
the
track
at
its
foot
he
lay
stunned
and
still
chapter
xiii
the
interested
spectator
as
james
logie
dashed
back
to
his
men
to
meet
this
unexpected
attack
he
left
flemington
lying
with
his
face
to
the
bank
and
his
back
towards
the
river
he
was
so
close
to
the
edge
of
the
island
that
his
hair
rested
on
the
wet
sand
permeated
by
the
returning
tide
coming
up
the
esk
james
whole
mind
had
gone
back
like
a
released
spring
to
its
natural
preoccupation
and
he
almost
forgot
him
before
he
had
time
to
join
the
brisk
affray
that
was
going
on
but
though
archie
lay
where
he
fell
and
was
as
still
as
a
heap
of
driftwood
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
before
he
came
to
himself
perhaps
the
chill
of
the
damp
sand
under
his
head
helped
to
revive
him
perhaps
the
violence
of
the
blow
had
been
broken
by
the
sod
against
which
he
had
been
hurled
he
stirred
and
raised
himself
dazed
but
listening
to
the
confused
sounds
of
fighting
that
rang
over
inchbrayock
his
head
hurt
him
and
instinctively
he
grubbed
up
a
handful
of
the
cold
wet
sand
and
held
it
to
his
brow
his
wits
had
not
gone
far
for
there
had
been
no
long
break
in
his
consciousness
and
he
got
on
his
feet
and
looked
round
for
the
best
means
of
escape
james
knew
all
that
was
plain
enough
and
on
the
issue
of
the
skirmish
his
own
liberty
would
depend
if
he
did
not
get
clear
of
the
island
at
once
he
went
back
round
the
bend
and
looking
up
the
shore
he
saw
a
couple
of
the
which
were
only
half
covered
by
the
tide
in
the
middle
of
the
channel
they
had
disappeared
already
but
at
either
edge
they
lay
visible
like
the
two
ends
of
a
partly
submerged
chain
blood
was
trickling
down
his
face
but
he
washed
it
off
and
made
hastily
for
the
crossing
wading
in
the
esk
was
not
wide
just
there
though
it
was
far
deeper
than
he
had
fancied
it
and
he
stumbled
along
churning
up
the
mud
into
an
opaque
swirl
through
which
he
could
not
see
the
bottom
he
climbed
the
further
bank
wasting
no
time
in
looking
behind
him
and
never
stopped
until
he
stood
panting
and
dizzy
on
the
high
ridge
of
land
from
which
he
could
overlook
inchbrayock
and
the
harbour
and
town
he
was
a
good
deal
exhausted
for
his
head
throbbed
like
a
boiling
pot
and
his
hands
were
shaking
he
lay
down
in
a
patch
of
whins
remembering
that
he
was
on
the
he
meant
to
see
which
way
the
fortunes
of
war
were
going
to
turn
before
deciding
what
to
do
with
himself
thanks
to
chance
his
business
with
captain
hall
was
not
finished
nor
even
begun
but
as
things
seemed
at
present
captain
hall
might
be
a
prisoner
before
the
leisure
which
had
been
the
subject
of
his
own
gibes
that
morning
should
arrive
the
vessel
guns
had
roared
out
again
as
he
struggled
up
the
steep
but
there
had
been
silence
on
the
island
and
even
the
rattle
of
musketry
had
now
stopped
something
decisive
must
have
taken
place
though
he
could
not
guess
what
it
was
and
he
was
too
far
away
to
distinguish
more
than
the
moving
figures
in
the
graveyard
he
was
high
enough
to
see
the
curve
of
the
watery
horizon
for
ferryden
village
was
some
way
below
him
his
view
was
only
interrupted
by
a
group
of
firs
that
stood
like
an
outpost
between
him
and
the
land
end
he
lay
among
his
friendly
staring
down
on
the
strait
if
james
were
victorious
he
knew
that
there
would
soon
be
a
hue
and
cry
on
his
own
tracks
but
though
alive
to
the
desirableness
of
a
good
start
in
these
circumstances
he
felt
that
he
could
not
run
while
there
remained
any
chance
of
laying
the
whole
of
his
report
before
captain
hall
he
thought
from
what
he
had
seen
of
the
man
that
the
less
he
was
reckoned
with
by
his
superiors
the
better
but
it
was
not
his
business
to
consider
that
as
he
turned
these
things
over
in
his
mind
his
eyes
were
attracted
to
dial
hill
upon
which
the
sudden
sign
of
a
new
turn
of
events
could
be
read
he
could
see
the
group
of
men
with
the
guns
below
the
flagstaff
which
crowned
its
summit
and
what
now
attracted
his
attention
was
a
dark
object
that
had
been
run
up
the
ropes
its
irregular
outline
flapping
and
flying
against
the
sky
as
it
was
drawn
frantically
up
and
down
flemington
was
blessed
with
long
sight
and
he
was
certain
that
the
two
ends
that
waved
like
streamers
as
the
dark
object
dipped
and
rose
were
the
sleeves
of
a
man
coat
he
saw
a
figure
detach
itself
from
the
rest
and
run
towards
the
seaward
edge
of
the
eminence
ferrier
for
he
supposed
now
that
ferrier
was
on
the
hill
must
be
signalling
out
to
sea
with
this
makeshift
flag
he
half
raised
himself
from
his
lair
the
cold
of
the
ocean
spread
along
the
world
edge
broken
by
tiny
streaks
of
foam
as
the
wind
began
to
freshen
and
beyond
the
seen
through
their
stems
the
reason
of
the
activity
on
dial
hill
slid
into
sight
a
ship
was
coming
up
the
coast
not
a
couple
of
miles
out
and
as
flemington
watched
her
she
stood
in
landward
as
though
attracted
out
of
her
course
by
the
signals
and
the
sound
of
firing
in
montrose
harbour
she
was
too
far
off
for
him
to
distinguish
her
colours
but
he
knew
enough
about
shipping
to
be
certain
that
she
was
a
french
frigate
he
dropped
back
into
his
place
whilst
these
sensational
matters
were
going
forward
he
did
not
suppose
that
anyone
would
think
of
pursuing
him
the
fact
that
the
rebels
were
signalling
her
in
suggested
that
the
stranger
might
not
be
unexpected
and
in
all
probability
she
carried
french
supplies
and
jacobite
troops
the
likelihood
of
an
interview
with
captain
hall
grew
more
remote
the
frigate
drew
closer
soon
she
was
hidden
from
him
by
the
jutting
out
of
the
land
another
shot
broke
from
the
but
the
quick
reply
from
the
island
took
all
doubt
of
the
issue
of
the
conflict
from
archie
mind
james
was
in
full
possession
of
the
place
and
the
surprise
must
have
been
a
failure
archie
watched
eagerly
to
see
the
ship
arrive
in
the
it
was
evident
that
hall
from
his
position
under
the
south
shore
of
the
strait
had
not
seen
her
yet
presently
she
rounded
the
land
and
appeared
to
the
hundreds
of
eyes
on
the
quays
a
gallant
silent
winged
creature
a
vivid
apparition
against
the
band
of
sea
beyond
the
opening
channel
of
the
esk
swept
towards
the
town
as
though
by
some
unseen
impulse
of
fate
the
shout
that
went
up
as
she
came
into
view
rose
to
where
archie
lay
on
the
hillside
the
tide
was
now
running
high
and
she
passed
in
under
dial
hill
her
deck
was
covered
with
troops
and
the
waving
of
hats
and
the
cheers
of
the
townspeople
who
were
pouring
along
the
further
side
of
the
harbour
made
the
truth
plain
to
the
solitary
watcher
among
the
whins
the
sent
a
shot
to
meet
her
that
fell
just
in
front
of
her
bows
but
although
it
was
followed
by
a
second
that
cut
her
rigging
no
great
harm
was
done
and
she
answered
with
a
broadside
that
echoed
off
the
walls
of
the
town
till
the
strait
was
in
a
roar
it
had
no
time
to
subside
before
james
gun
on
inchbrayock
began
again
flemington
could
see
that
hall
surrender
could
only
be
a
matter
of
time
the
would
soon
be
landing
her
troops
out
of
his
range
and
having
done
so
would
be
certain
to
attack
the
from
the
ferryden
side
of
the
river
half
of
hall
men
were
on
the
island
which
was
in
possession
of
the
rebels
his
vessel
was
damaged
and
in
no
condition
to
escape
to
sea
even
had
there
been
no
hostile
craft
in
his
way
and
no
dial
hill
to
stand
threatening
between
him
and
the
ocean
the
time
had
come
for
archie
to
think
of
his
own
plight
and
of
his
own
prospects
he
was
adrift
again
cut
off
even
from
the
disorderly
ship
that
had
sheltered
him
last
night
and
from
the
unlucky
sot
who
commanded
her
his
best
plan
would
be
to
take
the
news
of
capture
to
edinburgh
for
it
would
be
madness
for
him
to
think
of
going
to
perth
whilst
his
identity
as
a
government
agent
would
be
published
by
ferrier
and
logie
all
over
that
part
of
the
country
he
was
cast
down
as
he
sat
with
his
hand
to
his
aching
head
and
now
that
it
had
resulted
in
that
fatal
meeting
his
own
folly
in
going
to
the
island
seemed
incredible
his
luck
had
been
so
good
all
his
life
and
after
the
many
years
that
he
had
trusted
her
the
jade
had
turned
on
him
he
had
been
too
with
her
that
was
the
explanation
of
it
he
had
asked
too
much
he
had
been
in
her
in
himself
flemington
was
neither
vain
nor
conceited
being
too
heartily
interested
in
outside
things
to
take
very
personal
points
of
view
he
merely
went
straight
on
with
the
joy
of
life
lighting
his
progress
but
now
he
had
put
the
crown
on
his
foolhardiness
he
had
had
so
many
good
things
strength
health
wits
charm
the
stage
of
his
stirring
life
whereon
to
use
them
and
behind
that
stage
the
peaceful
background
of
the
home
he
loved
filled
with
the
presence
of
the
being
he
most
admired
and
revered
on
earth
but
new
lights
had
broken
in
on
him
of
late
troublous
lights
playing
from
behind
a
curtain
that
hid
unknown
things
suddenly
he
had
turned
and
followed
them
impelled
by
uncomprehended
forces
in
himself
and
it
seemed
that
in
consequence
all
around
him
had
shifted
disintegrated
leaving
him
stranded
once
more
as
he
watched
his
anxious
eyes
on
the
scene
below
him
his
heart
full
of
his
own
perplexities
a
last
roar
of
shot
filled
the
harbour
and
then
on
the
he
saw
the
flag
hauled
down
he
rose
and
looked
about
him
telling
himself
that
he
must
get
as
far
from
the
neighbourhood
of
montrose
as
he
could
in
the
shortest
possible
time
sixty
miles
of
land
stretched
between
him
and
edinburgh
and
the
only
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
start
by
way
of
the
nearest
seaport
from
which
he
could
sail
for
leith
he
was
a
very
different
figure
from
the
young
man
who
had
ridden
away
from
ardguys
only
yesterday
for
he
was
soaked
to
above
the
knees
from
wading
in
the
esk
blood
had
dripped
on
his
coat
from
the
cut
on
his
forehead
and
his
hair
at
the
back
was
clogged
with
sand
excitement
had
kept
him
from
thinking
how
cold
he
was
and
he
had
not
known
that
he
was
shivering
but
he
knew
it
as
he
stood
in
the
teeth
of
the
fresh
wind
he
laughed
in
spite
of
his
plight
it
was
so
odd
to
think
of
starting
for
edinburgh
from
a
he
turned
southwards
determining
to
go
forward
till
he
should
strike
the
road
leading
to
the
seaport
of
aberbrothock
by
sticking
to
the
high
ground
he
would
soon
come
to
it
at
the
inland
end
of
the
basin
and
by
it
he
might
reach
aberbrothock
by
nightfall
and
thence
take
sail
in
the
morning
this
was
the
best
plan
he
could
devise
though
he
did
not
care
to
contemplate
the
miles
he
would
have
to
trudge
he
knew
that
the
broken
coast
took
a
great
inward
curve
and
that
by
this
means
he
would
be
avoiding
its
ins
and
outs
and
he
wished
that
he
did
not
feel
so
giddy
and
so
little
able
to
face
his
difficulties
he
remembered
that
the
money
he
had
on
him
made
a
respectable
sum
and
realized
that
the
less
worth
robbing
he
looked
the
more
likely
he
would
be
to
get
to
his
journey
end
in
safety
he
stepped
out
with
an
effort
southward
he
must
go
and
for
some
time
to
come
angus
must
know
him
no
more
chapter
xiv
in
search
of
sensation
when
skirling
wattie
had
delivered
his
letter
to
flemington
on
the
foregoing
day
he
watched
the
young
man
out
of
sight
with
disgust
and
cursed
him
for
a
jackanapes
he
was
not
used
to
be
treated
in
such
a
fashion
there
was
that
about
archie
which
took
his
fancy
for
the
suggestion
of
stir
and
movement
that
went
everywhere
with
flemington
pleased
him
and
roused
his
unfailing
curiosity
the
beggar
most
pleasant
characteristic
was
his
interest
in
everybody
and
everything
his
worst
the
unseasonable
brutality
with
which
he
gratified
it
a
livelihood
gained
by
his
own
powers
of
cajolery
and
persistence
had
left
him
without
a
spark
of
respect
for
his
kind
he
would
have
been
a
man
of
prowess
had
his
limbs
been
intact
and
destiny
in
robbing
his
body
of
activity
had
transferred
that
quality
to
his
brains
his
huge
shoulders
and
broad
fists
the
arrogant
male
glare
of
his
roving
eye
might
well
hint
at
the
wisdom
of
providence
in
keeping
his
sphere
of
action
to
the
narrow
limits
of
a
those
who
look
for
likenesses
between
people
and
animals
would
be
reminded
by
him
of
a
wild
boar
and
it
was
almost
shocking
to
anyone
with
a
sense
of
fitness
to
hear
the
mellow
and
touching
voice
rich
with
the
indescribable
quiver
of
pathos
and
tragedy
that
proceeded
from
his
bristly
jaws
when
he
sang
the
world
that
it
conjured
up
before
imaginative
listeners
was
a
world
of
twilight
of
stars
that
drew
a
trail
of
lustre
about
the
ancient
haunted
places
of
the
country
stars
that
had
shone
on
battlefields
and
on
the
partings
of
lovers
that
had
looked
on
the
raids
of
the
border
and
had
stood
over
the
dark
among
the
peat
it
was
a
strange
truth
that
in
the
voice
of
this
coarse
and
humble
vagabond
lay
the
whole
distinctive
spirit
of
the
national
poetry
of
scotland
in
the
last
few
months
his
employment
had
added
new
zest
to
his
life
for
it
was
not
only
the
pay
he
received
for
his
occasional
carrying
of
letters
that
was
welcome
to
him
his
bold
and
guileful
soul
delighted
in
the
occupation
for
its
own
sake
he
was
something
of
a
student
of
human
nature
as
all
those
who
live
by
their
wits
must
be
of
necessity
and
the
small
services
he
was
called
upon
to
give
brought
him
into
contact
with
new
varieties
of
men
archie
was
new
to
him
and
in
the
beggar
opinion
immeasurably
more
amusing
than
anyone
he
had
seen
yet
in
modern
parlance
he
would
be
called
sportsman
this
old
ruffian
who
had
lost
his
legs
and
who
was
left
to
the
mercy
of
his
own
ingenuity
and
to
the
efforts
of
the
five
dumb
animals
which
supplemented
his
loss
he
had
all
honour
to
him
kept
his
love
of
life
and
its
chances
through
his
misfortune
and
though
he
did
not
know
it
himself
it
was
his
recognition
of
the
same
spirit
in
flemington
that
made
him
appreciate
the
young
man
his
services
to
the
state
had
not
been
important
up
to
the
present
time
a
few
letters
carried
a
little
information
collected
had
been
the
extent
of
his
usefulness
but
though
he
was
not
in
their
regular
employ
the
authorities
were
keeping
a
favourable
eye
on
him
for
he
had
so
far
proved
himself
capable
and
a
very
miracle
of
local
knowledge
he
sat
in
his
cart
looking
resentfully
after
flemington
between
the
stems
of
the
alders
and
the
lattice
of
their
leaves
and
though
the
one
word
tossed
over
the
rider
shoulders
did
not
tell
him
much
he
determined
he
would
not
lose
sight
of
archie
if
he
could
help
it
brechin
might
mean
anything
from
a
night
lodging
to
a
lengthened
stay
but
he
would
follow
him
as
far
as
he
dared
and
set
about
discovering
his
movements
skirling
wattie
had
friends
in
brechin
as
he
had
in
most
places
round
about
and
certain
of
his
own
wherein
he
could
always
find
shelter
for
himself
and
his
dogs
but
he
did
not
mean
to
trust
himself
nearer
than
these
refuges
to
lord
balnillo
at
any
rate
not
for
a
few
days
chance
had
relieved
him
of
the
letter
for
which
he
was
responsible
sooner
than
he
expected
and
at
present
he
was
a
free
man
he
roused
his
team
tucked
his
pipes
into
their
corner
of
the
cart
and
guiding
himself
carefully
between
the
trees
issued
from
the
thicket
like
some
ribald
vision
of
goblinry
escaped
from
the
world
of
he
turned
towards
brechin
and
set
off
for
the
town
at
a
brisk
trot
the
yellow
dog
straining
at
his
harness
and
his
comrades
taking
their
pace
from
him
every
inch
of
the
road
was
known
to
wattie
every
tree
and
tuft
every
rut
and
hole
and
as
there
were
plenty
of
these
last
he
bumped
and
swung
along
in
a
way
that
would
have
dislocated
the
bones
of
a
lighter
person
the
violent
roughness
of
his
progress
was
what
served
him
for
exercise
and
kept
him
in
health
there
were
not
many
houses
near
the
highway
but
the
children
playing
round
the
doors
of
the
few
he
passed
hailed
him
with
shouts
and
he
answered
them
as
he
answered
everyone
with
his
familiar
wag
of
the
head
when
he
entered
brechin
and
rolled
past
the
high
circular
shaft
of
its
round
tower
the
world
made
way
for
him
with
a
grin
and
when
it
was
not
agile
enough
to
please
him
he
heralded
himself
with
a
shrill
note
from
the
chanter
which
he
had
unscrewed
from
his
pipes
business
was
business
with
him
he
meant
to
lie
in
the
town
but
he
was
anxious
to
get
on
to
flemington
tracks
before
the
scent
was
cold
he
drove
to
the
swan
inn
and
entered
the
yard
and
there
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
archie
horse
being
rubbed
down
with
a
wisp
of
straw
its
rider
he
made
out
had
left
the
inn
on
foot
half
an
hour
earlier
so
with
this
meagre
clue
he
sought
the
streets
and
the
company
of
the
idlers
haunting
their
thievish
corners
to
whom
the
passing
stranger
and
what
might
be
made
out
of
him
were
the
best
interests
of
the
day
by
the
time
the
light
was
failing
he
had
traced
flemington
down
to
the
river
where
he
had
been
last
seen
crossing
the
bridge
the
beggar
was
a
good
deal
surprised
he
could
not
imagine
what
was
carrying
archie
away
from
the
place
in
the
dusk
he
descended
the
steep
streets
running
down
to
the
esk
and
slackening
his
pace
took
out
a
short
stout
pair
of
crutches
that
he
kept
beside
him
using
them
as
brakes
on
either
side
of
the
cart
people
who
saw
wattie
for
the
first
time
would
stand
to
watch
the
incredible
spectacle
of
his
passage
through
a
town
but
to
the
inhabitants
of
brechin
he
was
too
familiar
a
sight
for
anything
but
the
natural
widening
of
the
mouth
that
his
advent
would
produce
from
pure
force
of
habit
the
lights
lit
here
and
there
were
beginning
to
repeat
themselves
in
the
water
and
men
were
returning
to
their
houses
after
the
day
work
as
he
stopped
his
cart
and
sent
out
that
surest
of
all
attractions
the
first
notes
of
tod
into
the
gathering
mists
of
the
by
ones
and
twos
the
details
of
a
sympathetic
audience
drew
together
round
him
as
his
voice
rose
over
the
sliding
rush
of
the
esk
idlers
on
the
bridge
leaned
over
the
grey
arches
as
the
sound
came
to
them
above
the
tongue
of
the
little
rapid
that
babbled
as
it
lost
itself
in
the
shadow
of
the
woods
downstream
then
the
pipes
took
up
their
tune
jests
and
roars
of
laughter
oiled
the
springs
of
generosity
and
the
good
prospects
of
supper
and
a
bed
began
to
smile
upon
the
beggar
when
darkness
set
in
he
turned
his
wheels
towards
a
shed
that
a
publican
had
put
at
his
disposal
for
the
night
and
he
and
his
dogs
laid
themselves
down
to
rest
in
its
comfortable
straw
the
yellow
cur
relieved
from
his
harness
stole
closer
and
closer
to
his
master
and
lay
with
his
jowl
against
the
pipes
presently
wattie
dirty
hand
went
out
and
sought
the
coarse
head
of
his
servant
doag
he
was
muttering
as
he
went
to
sleep
perhaps
in
all
the
grim
grey
little
scottish
town
no
living
creature
closed
its
eyes
more
contentedly
than
the
poor
cur
whose
head
was
pillowed
in
paradise
because
of
the
touch
that
was
on
it
morning
found
man
and
dogs
out
betimes
and
migrating
to
the
heart
of
the
town
wattie
was
one
who
liked
to
get
an
early
draught
from
the
of
news
to
be
beforehand
so
to
speak
with
his
day
the
swan
inn
was
his
goal
and
he
had
not
got
up
the
hill
towards
it
when
his
practised
eye
wise
in
other
men
movements
saw
that
the
world
was
hurrying
along
drawn
by
some
magnet
stronger
than
its
legitimate
work
the
women
were
running
out
of
their
houses
too
as
he
toiled
up
the
steep
incline
a
figure
burst
from
the
mouth
of
a
wynd
and
came
flying
down
the
middle
of
the
narrow
way
hey
what
ails
ye
man
what
ye
he
cried
stopping
his
cart
and
spreading
out
his
arms
as
though
to
embrace
the
approaching
man
the
other
paused
he
was
a
pale
youth
whose
progress
seemed
as
little
responsible
as
that
of
a
discharged
missile
there
fechtin
he
yelled
apparently
addressing
the
air
in
general
fechtin
ay
there
fechtin
at
montrose
this
hour
syne
div
ye
no
hear
them
ye
deef
muckle
swine
continued
the
youth
rendered
abusive
by
excitement
the
two
stared
in
each
other
faces
as
those
do
who
listen
dull
and
distant
a
muffled
boom
drove
in
from
the
coast
a
second
throb
followed
it
the
youth
dropped
his
raised
hands
and
fled
on
wattie
turned
his
dogs
and
set
off
down
the
hill
without
more
delay
here
was
the
reason
that
archie
had
left
the
town
it
was
in
expectation
of
this
present
disturbance
on
the
coast
that
he
had
slipped
out
of
brechin
by
the
less
frequented
road
round
the
basin
he
scurried
down
the
hill
scattering
the
children
playing
in
the
kennel
with
loud
imprecations
and
threats
he
sped
over
the
bridge
and
was
soon
climbing
the
rise
on
the
farther
side
of
the
esk
if
there
was
fighting
going
on
he
would
make
shift
to
see
it
and
montrose
would
be
visible
from
most
of
his
road
soon
he
would
get
a
view
of
the
distant
harbour
and
would
see
the
smoke
of
the
guns
whose
throats
continued
to
trouble
the
air
also
he
would
get
forward
unmolested
for
there
would
be
the
width
of
the
basin
between
himself
and
lord
balnillo
he
breathed
his
team
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
for
he
was
a
scientific
driver
and
he
had
some
way
to
go
he
cast
a
glance
down
at
the
place
he
had
left
rejoicing
that
no
one
had
followed
him
out
of
it
when
he
was
on
his
own
errands
he
did
not
like
company
preferring
like
most
independent
characters
to
develop
his
intentions
in
the
perfect
freedom
of
silence
when
he
drew
near
enough
to
distinguish
the
a
dark
spot
under
the
lee
of
ferryden
he
saw
the
white
puffs
of
smoke
bursting
from
her
and
the
answering
clouds
rising
from
the
island
there
had
been
no
time
to
hear
the
rumours
of
the
morning
before
he
met
the
pale
young
man
or
he
would
have
learned
that
a
body
of
prince
men
under
ferrier
had
left
brechin
last
night
whilst
he
lay
sound
asleep
in
the
straw
among
his
dogs
he
could
not
imagine
where
the
assailants
had
come
from
who
were
pounding
at
the
ship
from
inchbrayock
the
fields
sloped
away
from
him
to
the
water
leaving
an
uninterrupted
view
he
pressed
on
to
the
at
which
he
must
turn
along
the
basin
shore
from
there
on
the
conformation
of
the
land
and
the
frequent
clumps
of
trees
would
shut
out
both
town
and
harbour
from
his
sight
until
he
came
parallel
with
the
island
he
halted
at
the
turning
for
a
last
look
at
the
town
the
firing
had
ceased
which
reconciled
him
a
little
to
the
eclipse
of
the
distant
spectacle
then
he
drove
on
again
unconscious
of
the
sight
he
was
to
miss
for
unsuspected
by
him
as
by
the
crowd
thronging
the
quays
of
montrose
the
french
frigate
was
creeping
up
the
coast
and
she
made
her
appearance
in
the
just
as
wattie
began
the
tamer
stage
of
his
journey
the
yellow
cur
and
his
companions
toiled
along
at
their
steady
trot
their
red
tongues
hanging
the
broadside
from
the
french
ship
rang
inland
and
the
beggar
groaned
urging
them
with
curses
and
chosen
abuse
his
intimate
knowledge
of
the
neighbourhood
led
him
to
steer
for
the
identical
spot
on
which
flemington
crouched
in
his
had
looked
down
on
the
affray
and
he
hoped
devoutly
that
he
might
reach
that
point
of
vantage
while
there
was
still
something
to
be
seen
from
it
silence
had
settled
on
the
strait
once
more
not
far
in
front
a
man
was
coming
into
sight
the
first
creature
wattie
had
seen
since
leaving
brechin
whose
face
was
turned
from
the
coast
he
seemed
a
person
of
irresolute
mind
as
well
as
of
vacillating
feet
for
every
few
yards
he
would
stop
hesitating
before
resuming
his
way
the
beggar
cursed
him
heartily
for
a
drunkard
for
though
he
had
a
lively
sympathy
with
backsliders
of
that
kind
he
knew
that
accurate
information
was
the
last
thing
to
be
expected
from
them
before
the
wayfarers
had
halved
the
distance
between
them
the
man
stopped
and
sitting
down
by
the
tumbledown
stone
dyke
at
the
roadside
dropped
his
head
in
his
hands
as
the
cart
passed
him
a
few
minutes
later
he
raised
a
ghastly
face
and
skirling
wattie
pulled
up
astounded
with
a
loud
and
profane
exclamation
as
he
recognized
flemington
though
archie
had
been
glad
to
escape
from
the
beggar
yesterday
he
was
now
thankful
to
see
anyone
who
might
pass
for
a
friend
he
tried
to
smile
but
his
eyes
closed
again
and
he
put
out
his
hand
towards
the
dyke
i
so
devilish
giddy
he
said
wattie
looked
at
the
cut
on
his
head
and
the
stains
of
blood
on
his
coat
ye
gotten
a
rare
dunt
he
observed
archie
who
seemed
to
himself
to
be
slipping
off
the
rounded
edge
of
the
world
made
no
reply
the
other
sat
eyeing
him
with
perplexity
and
some
impatience
he
did
not
know
what
he
wanted
most
to
get
to
montrose
or
to
get
news
out
of
flemington
the
dogs
lay
down
in
the
mud
flemington
kept
his
hand
to
his
eyes
for
a
minute
and
then
lifted
his
head
again
the
ship
has
surrendered
he
said
speaking
with
difficulty
i
have
been
on
the
high
ground
watching
she
struck
her
flag
a
french
frigate
he
stopped
again
the
road
on
which
he
sat
was
whirling
down
into
illimitable
space
the
other
took
in
his
plight
his
coat
torn
in
his
struggle
with
logie
was
full
of
and
the
wet
mud
was
caked
on
his
legs
his
soft
silky
hair
was
flattened
on
his
forehead
ye
been
fechtin
yersel
ma
lad
said
wattie
whaur
hae
ye
been
there
a
rebel
force
on
inchbrayock
said
archie
with
another
effort
i
have
been
on
the
island
yes
i
been
fighting
a
man
recognized
me
a
man
i
saw
at
on
the
road
by
balnillo
they
will
be
hunting
me
soon
and
i
have
papers
on
me
they
must
not
find
and
money
all
the
money
i
have
god
knows
how
i
am
to
get
away
i
must
get
to
aberbrothock
what
was
ye
sayin
aboot
the
french
in
broken
sentences
and
between
his
fits
of
giddiness
archie
explained
the
situation
in
the
harbour
and
the
beggar
listened
his
bristly
brows
knit
his
bonnet
thrust
back
on
his
bald
head
and
his
own
best
course
of
action
grew
clear
to
him
montrose
would
soon
be
full
of
rebel
soldiers
and
though
these
might
be
generous
audiences
when
merry
with
wine
and
loose
upon
the
streets
their
presence
would
make
him
no
safer
from
lord
balnillo
wattie
knew
that
the
loyalty
was
beginning
to
be
suspected
and
that
he
might
well
have
friends
among
the
prince
officers
whose
arrival
might
attract
him
to
the
town
and
to
serve
archie
would
be
a
good
recommendation
for
himself
with
his
employers
to
say
nothing
of
any
private
gratitude
that
the
young
man
might
feel
bide
you
whaur
ye
are
he
exclaimed
rousing
his
dogs
lad
hae
to
ca
ye
oot
o
this
an
dod
we
need
a
our
time
not
far
from
them
a
spring
was
trickling
from
the
fields
dropping
in
a
spurt
through
the
damp
mosses
between
the
unpointed
stones
of
the
dyke
the
obedient
dogs
drew
their
master
close
to
it
and
he
filled
a
battered
pannikin
that
he
took
from
among
his
small
collection
of
necessities
in
the
bottom
of
the
cart
he
returned
with
the
water
and
when
archie
had
bathed
his
head
in
its
icy
coldness
he
drew
a
from
its
snug
lair
under
the
bagpipes
and
forced
him
to
drink
it
was
half
full
for
the
friendly
publican
had
replenished
his
store
before
they
parted
on
the
foregoing
night
as
the
liquid
warmed
his
stomach
archie
raised
his
head
slowly
i
believe
i
can
walk
now
he
said
at
last
ye
need
to
try
observed
wattie
dryly
ye
no
can
ride
wi
me
come
awa
maister
flemington
will
a
gi
ye
a
skelloch
o
the
pipes
to
help
ye
alang
in
god
name
no
cried
archie
whose
head
was
splitting
he
struggled
on
to
his
feet
the
whisky
was
beginning
to
overcome
the
giddiness
and
he
knew
that
every
minute
spent
on
the
highroad
was
a
risk
the
beggar
was
determined
to
go
to
aberbrothock
with
archie
he
did
not
consider
him
in
a
fit
state
to
be
left
alone
and
he
counselled
him
to
leave
the
road
at
once
and
to
cut
diagonally
across
the
high
ground
whilst
he
himself
debarred
by
his
wheels
from
going
across
country
drove
back
to
the
cross
roads
and
took
the
one
to
the
coast
by
doing
this
the
pair
would
meet
flemington
having
taken
one
side
of
the
triangle
while
wattie
had
traversed
the
other
two
they
were
to
await
each
other
at
a
spot
indicated
by
the
latter
where
a
bit
of
moor
encroached
on
the
way
as
wattie
turned
again
to
retrace
his
road
he
watched
his
friend
toiling
painfully
up
the
slanting
ground
among
the
uneven
tussocks
of
grass
with
some
anxiety
archie
laboured
along
pausing
now
and
again
to
rest
but
he
managed
to
gain
the
summit
of
the
ridge
wattie
saw
his
figure
shorten
from
the
feet
up
as
he
crossed
the
till
his
head
and
shoulders
dropped
out
of
sight
like
the
topsails
of
a
ship
over
a
clear
horizon
he
was
disappointed
at
having
missed
the
sight
of
so
much
good
fighting
archie
account
had
been
rather
incoherent
but
he
gathered
that
the
rebels
were
in
possession
of
the
harbour
and
that
a
french
ship
had
come
in
in
the
middle
of
the
affray
full
of
rebel
troops
he
shouted
the
information
to
the
few
people
he
met
he
turned
southward
at
the
cross
roads
behind
him
lay
the
panorama
of
the
basin
and
the
spread
of
the
rolling
country
brechin
the
esk
the
woods
of
monrummon
moor
stretching
out
to
forfar
and
northward
the
grampians
lying
with
their
long
shoulders
in
the
autumn
light
his
beat
for
begging
was
down
there
across
the
water
and
round
about
the
country
between
town
and
town
but
though
his
activities
were
in
that
direction
he
knew
aberbrothock
and
the
coast
well
for
he
had
been
born
in
a
in
one
of
its
creeks
and
had
spent
his
early
years
at
sea
he
would
be
able
to
put
archie
in
the
way
of
a
passage
to
leith
without
much
trouble
and
without
unnecessary
explanations
archie
had
money
on
him
and
could
be
trusted
to
pay
his
way
he
was
the
first
to
reach
the
and
he
drew
up
glad
to
give
his
team
a
rest
at
last
he
saw
archie
coming
along
with
the
slow
careful
gait
of
a
man
who
is
obliged
to
consider
each
step
of
his
way
separately
in
order
to
get
on
at
all
sit
ye
doon
he
exclaimed
as
they
met
if
once
i
sit
down
i
am
lost
said
archie
come
on
he
started
along
the
road
with
the
same
dogged
step
the
beggar
keeping
alongside
they
had
gone
about
half
a
mile
when
flemington
clutched
at
a
wayside
bush
and
then
slid
to
the
ground
in
a
heap
wattie
pulled
up
dismayed
and
scanned
their
surroundings
to
let
him
lie
there
by
the
road
was
out
of
the
question
he
could
not
tell
how
much
his
head
had
been
injured
but
he
knew
enough
to
be
sure
that
exposure
and
cold
might
bring
a
serious
illness
on
a
man
in
his
state
he
did
not
understand
that
the
whisky
he
had
given
archie
was
the
worst
possible
thing
for
him
to
the
beggar
it
was
the
sovereign
remedy
for
all
trouble
of
mind
or
body
he
cursed
his
own
circumscribed
energies
there
was
no
one
in
sight
the
nearest
habitation
was
a
little
farmhouse
on
the
skirts
of
the
moor
with
one
tiny
window
in
its
making
a
dark
spot
high
under
the
roof
wattie
turned
his
wheels
reluctantly
towards
it
unwilling
though
he
was
to
draw
attention
to
his
companion
there
was
no
choice
chapter
xv
wattie
has
theories
though
skirling
wattie
seldom
occupied
the
same
bed
on
many
consecutive
nights
his
various
had
so
great
a
family
likeness
that
he
could
not
always
remember
where
he
was
when
he
chanced
to
wake
in
the
small
hours
sheds
barns
stables
harboured
him
in
the
cold
months
when
luck
was
good
loanings
old
quarries
the
alder
clump
beyond
brechin
or
the
at
magdalen
chapel
in
the
summer
he
lay
in
the
barn
abutting
on
the
tiny
farmhouse
at
which
he
had
sought
shelter
for
archie
he
had
met
with
a
reception
from
the
woman
who
came
to
the
door
her
man
was
away
she
told
him
and
she
was
unwilling
to
admit
strangers
in
his
absence
she
had
never
seen
wattie
before
and
it
was
plain
that
she
did
not
like
his
looks
he
induced
her
at
last
with
the
greatest
difficulty
to
give
shelter
in
her
barn
to
the
comrade
whom
he
described
as
lying
in
extremity
at
the
roadside
finally
she
despatched
her
son
a
youth
of
fifteen
to
accompany
the
beggar
and
to
help
to
bring
the
sufferer
back
cold
water
revived
archie
again
and
he
reached
the
barn
with
the
assistance
of
the
lad
who
better
disposed
than
his
mother
cut
a
bundle
of
dry
heather
which
he
spread
in
a
corner
for
his
comfort
the
woman
looked
with
silent
surprise
at
her
undesired
guest
she
had
thought
to
see
a
of
different
condition
in
company
with
the
masterful
old
blackguard
in
the
cart
her
glances
and
her
expressive
silence
made
wattie
uneasy
but
there
was
no
help
for
their
plight
whilst
flemington
could
scarcely
stand
the
beggar
had
spent
the
rest
of
that
day
in
the
barn
he
was
not
suffered
to
enter
the
farm
nor
was
he
offered
any
food
but
he
had
enough
store
by
him
from
what
he
had
collected
in
brechin
for
his
own
needs
and
those
of
his
team
archie
only
requirement
was
the
bowl
of
water
that
his
companion
had
obtained
from
the
boy
he
lay
alternately
dozing
and
tossing
on
his
pile
of
heather
his
body
was
chilled
for
his
high
boots
had
been
full
of
the
esk
water
and
wattie
had
hesitated
to
draw
them
off
lest
he
should
be
unable
to
get
them
on
again
after
their
soaking
night
fell
on
the
barn
at
last
wattie
slept
sound
with
the
yellow
cur
muzzle
against
his
shoulder
but
he
awoke
towards
midnight
for
archie
feverish
voice
was
coming
from
the
corner
in
which
he
lay
he
inclined
his
ear
attracted
by
the
recurrent
name
of
logie
which
ran
through
the
disconnected
babblings
rising
again
and
again
like
some
object
carried
along
a
swift
stream
the
darkness
made
every
word
seem
more
distinct
listen
to
me
cried
flemington
logie
logie
you
do
not
understand
it
is
safe
it
is
burnt
nobody
shall
know
it
from
me
i
can
not
take
your
money
logie
i
will
tell
you
everything
but
you
will
not
understand
the
beggar
was
holding
his
breath
i
did
not
guess
it
was
inchbrayock
i
thought
it
would
not
be
inchbrayock
logie
i
will
say
nothing
but
i
will
tell
you
all
for
god
sake
logie
i
swear
it
is
true
listen
skirling
wattie
could
hear
him
struggling
as
though
he
were
fighting
for
his
life
not
to
ardguys
i
can
not
go
back
to
ardguys
i
shall
never
tell
never
never
tell
but
i
shall
know
where
you
are
they
shall
never
know
cried
archie
raising
his
voice
like
a
man
in
distress
calling
for
help
it
is
you
logie
my
god
let
me
go
the
beggar
dragged
himself
nearer
the
fragment
of
moon
did
no
more
than
turn
the
chinks
and
cracks
of
the
barn
to
a
dull
grey
and
he
could
hardly
see
the
outline
of
his
companion
the
nightmares
that
were
tormenting
archie
pointed
to
something
that
must
have
happened
before
he
came
by
his
hurt
and
the
injury
and
the
chill
had
produced
these
wanderings
there
were
troubles
boiling
in
his
mind
that
he
had
kept
behind
his
teeth
so
long
as
his
tongue
was
under
control
wattie
wondered
what
was
all
this
talk
of
lord
balnillo
brother
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
some
secret
between
this
man
suspected
as
he
well
knew
of
being
an
active
rebel
and
flemington
had
it
been
light
wattie
would
have
tried
to
get
at
the
papers
that
archie
had
spoken
of
as
being
on
him
when
they
met
for
these
might
give
him
some
clue
to
the
mystery
he
sat
in
the
dark
leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
barn
his
arms
tightly
folded
across
his
great
chest
his
lips
pursed
his
gaze
bent
on
the
restless
figure
that
he
could
just
distinguish
all
at
once
archie
sat
up
where
are
you
he
asked
in
a
high
strained
voice
a
here
replied
the
beggar
is
it
you
logie
exclaimed
flemington
it
mysel
wattie
smoothed
the
roughness
out
of
his
accent
as
best
he
could
the
other
seemed
to
be
hovering
on
the
brink
of
consciousness
he
sank
back
it
is
not
logie
he
said
but
you
can
tell
him
wattie
leaned
forward
and
laid
his
broad
palm
firmly
and
very
gently
on
his
shoulder
what
a
tell
him
said
he
flemington
turned
towards
him
and
groped
about
with
his
hot
hand
tell
him
from
me
that
he
can
trust
me
he
said
in
a
hoarse
earnest
whisper
the
beggar
touch
seemed
to
quiet
him
he
lay
still
murmuring
indistinctly
between
snatches
of
silence
once
again
he
sat
up
groping
about
you
will
not
forget
he
said
na
na
replied
wattie
he
pushed
him
gently
back
patting
him
now
and
again
as
a
nurse
might
pat
a
restless
child
and
archie
grew
calmer
the
hand
quieted
him
rough
dirty
guileful
profane
as
he
was
without
scruple
or
conscience
or
anything
but
the
desire
to
do
the
best
for
himself
skirling
wattie
had
got
lodged
in
body
or
spirit
or
in
whatsoever
part
of
man
the
uncomprehended
force
dwells
that
personal
magnetism
which
is
independent
alike
of
grace
and
of
virtue
which
can
exist
in
a
soil
that
is
barren
of
either
it
may
have
been
that
which
the
yellow
cur
with
the
clear
vision
belonging
to
some
animals
recognized
and
adored
seeing
not
only
the
coarse
and
jovial
reprobate
who
was
his
master
but
the
shadow
of
the
mysterious
power
that
had
touched
him
the
dog
awakened
by
archie
cry
found
that
the
beggar
had
moved
and
drew
closer
to
his
side
flemington
dozed
off
again
and
wattie
sat
thinking
he
longed
to
stir
him
up
that
he
might
have
the
chance
of
hearing
more
of
his
rambling
talk
but
he
refrained
not
from
humane
feeling
but
from
the
fear
that
the
talker
if
he
were
tampered
with
might
be
too
ill
to
be
moved
on
the
morrow
sleep
was
his
best
chance
and
wattie
had
made
up
his
mind
that
if
it
were
possible
to
move
him
he
would
prevail
on
the
boy
to
get
a
beast
from
the
nearest
place
that
boasted
anything
which
could
carry
him
to
aberbrothock
he
knew
that
flemington
could
pay
for
it
and
he
would
direct
him
to
a
small
inn
in
that
place
whose
landlord
besides
being
a
retired
smuggler
was
a
distant
kinsman
of
his
own
the
matter
of
a
passage
to
leith
could
be
arranged
through
the
same
source
for
a
consideration
archie
should
take
his
chance
by
himself
he
realized
with
some
bitterness
the
bright
opportunities
that
can
be
lost
upon
a
being
who
has
no
legs
to
speak
of
for
he
could
easily
have
relieved
him
of
what
money
he
carried
had
he
been
an
man
it
was
not
that
he
lacked
the
force
for
such
deeds
but
that
honesty
was
wantonly
thrust
upon
him
because
his
comings
and
goings
were
so
conspicuous
notoriety
takes
heavy
toll
and
he
had
about
the
same
chance
as
the
king
of
being
conveniently
mislaid
he
would
have
given
a
good
deal
for
a
sight
of
the
papers
that
archie
carried
and
though
the
darkness
interfered
with
him
now
he
promised
himself
that
he
would
see
them
if
the
morning
light
should
find
him
still
delirious
he
could
not
make
out
how
ill
he
was
and
in
spite
of
his
curiosity
he
was
not
prepared
to
befriend
him
with
the
chance
of
his
growing
worse
to
have
him
dying
upon
his
hands
would
be
a
burden
too
great
to
endure
even
should
it
lead
to
no
awkward
questionings
he
would
get
rid
of
him
whether
his
curiosity
were
satisfied
or
not
he
had
heard
enough
to
make
him
suspect
very
strongly
that
flemington
was
in
the
pay
of
the
rebels
as
well
as
in
that
of
the
king
it
was
a
situation
that
he
personally
could
very
well
understand
but
the
night
turned
and
archie
grew
more
peaceful
as
the
hours
went
by
he
had
one
or
two
bouts
of
talking
but
they
were
incoherent
and
fitful
and
his
mind
appeared
now
to
be
straying
among
different
phantoms
there
was
no
more
about
logie
and
wattie
could
only
make
out
the
word
which
he
knew
as
the
name
of
a
place
beyond
forfar
and
as
he
had
discovered
in
brechin
that
flemington
lived
somewhere
in
those
parts
he
guessed
that
his
thoughts
were
roving
about
his
home
his
breathing
grew
less
laboured
and
the
watcher
could
hear
at
last
that
he
slept
the
moon
dropped
and
with
her
going
the
crevices
lost
their
greyness
and
the
barn
grew
black
the
beggar
who
was
a
healthy
sleeper
laid
himself
down
again
and
in
the
middle
of
his
cogitations
passed
into
oblivion
when
he
awoke
the
place
was
light
and
archie
was
looking
at
him
with
intelligent
eyes
they
were
hollow
and
there
were
dark
shadows
below
them
but
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
man
in
full
possession
of
his
wits
we
must
get
out
of
this
place
he
said
i
have
been
standing
up
but
my
knees
seem
so
heavy
i
can
hardly
walk
my
bones
ache
wattie
i
believe
there
is
fever
in
me
but
i
must
get
on
damn
it
man
we
are
a
sorry
pair
to
be
cast
on
the
world
like
this
i
fear
i
took
terrible
liberties
with
your
whisky
yesterday
it
was
a
still
misty
morning
when
the
beggar
having
harnessed
his
dogs
went
out
to
look
for
the
boy
when
he
was
gone
flemington
fumbled
with
his
shaking
fingers
for
the
different
packets
that
he
carried
all
were
there
safely
his
letters
his
money
he
trusted
nobody
and
he
did
not
like
having
to
trust
the
beggar
his
feverish
head
and
the
ague
in
his
bones
told
him
that
he
could
scarcely
hope
to
get
to
aberbrothock
on
foot
his
boots
were
still
wet
and
a
bruise
on
his
hip
that
he
had
got
in
falling
yesterday
had
begun
to
make
itself
felt
he
propped
himself
against
the
wall
and
reached
out
for
the
water
beside
him
wattie
had
been
some
time
away
when
the
barn
door
opened
and
the
appeared
on
the
threshold
considering
him
with
suspicious
disfavour
he
dragged
himself
to
his
feet
and
bowed
as
though
he
were
standing
upon
an
aubusson
carpet
instead
of
upon
a
pallet
of
withered
heather
the
action
seemed
to
confirm
her
distrust
madam
said
he
i
have
to
thank
you
for
a
night
shelter
and
for
this
excellent
refreshment
you
are
too
good
i
drink
to
you
he
raised
the
broken
delf
bowl
with
the
drain
of
water
that
remained
in
it
being
conscious
of
inhospitality
she
was
not
sure
how
much
irony
lay
in
his
words
and
his
face
told
her
nothing
it
the
last
ye
get
here
said
she
the
more
she
looked
at
flemington
the
more
she
was
impressed
by
his
undesirability
as
a
guest
she
was
one
of
those
to
whom
anything
uncommon
seemed
a
menace
madam
i
notice
that
you
dislike
me
why
wha
are
ye
she
inquired
after
a
pause
during
which
he
faced
her
smiling
his
eyebrows
raised
we
are
two
noblemen
travelling
for
pleasure
said
he
she
crossed
her
arms

contemptuously

cried
she
her
eyes
blazed
a
little
more
provocation
and
she
might
have
attacked
him
at
this
moment
wattie
cart
drove
into
the
yard
behind
her
axle
deep
in
the
sea
of
mud
and
manure
that
filled
the
place
she
turned
upon
the
she
could
not
deal
with
archie
but
the
beggar
was
a
foe
she
could
understand
and
she
advanced
a
whirl
of
abuse
upon
him
the
yellow
dog
growling
rose
battling
with
her
strident
tones
and
archie
seeing
the
mischief
his
tongue
had
wrought
limped
out
fearful
of
what
might
happen

roared
wattie
as
the
yellow
body
leaped
and
bounded
in
the
traces
amid
a
hurricane
of
snarling
and
shouts
he
contrived
by
plying
his
stick
to
turn
the
animals
and
to
get
them
out
of
the
yard
archie
followed
him
but
before
he
did
so
he
paused
to
turn
to
his
enemy
who
had
taken
shelter
in
the
doorway
of
the
barn
he
could
not
take
off
his
hat
to
her
because
he
had
no
hat
to
take
off
having
lost
it
on
inchbrayock
island
but
he
blew
a
kiss
from
the
points
of
his
fingers
with
an
air
that
almost
made
her
choke
wattie
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
called
angrily
to
him
he
could
not
understand
what
he
had
done
to
the
woman
to
move
her
to
such
a
tempest
of
wrath
but
he
told
himself
that
in
undertaking
to
escort
archie
he
had
made
a
leap
in
the
dark
he
would
direct
him
to
his
cousin
house
of
entertainment
in
aberbrothock
and
return
to
his
own
haunts
without
delay
at
the
nearest
point
of
road
the
boy
was
standing
by
a
nag
that
he
held
by
the
ear
a
few
minutes
later
they
had
parted
and
the
boy
made
happy
by
the
coin
he
had
been
given
was
returning
to
the
farm
while
the
beggar
who
had
also
reaped
some
profit
in
the
last
hours
watched
his
late
companion
disappearing
down
the
road
when
he
was
out
of
sight
he
turned
his
own
wheels
in
the
direction
of
brechin
and
set
off
at
a
sober
pace
for
that
friendly
town
he
was
singing
to
himself
as
he
went
first
because
he
owned
the
price
of
another
bottle
of
whisky
secondly
because
he
was
delighted
to
be
rid
of
flemington
and
thirdly
because
an
inspiring
idea
had
come
to
him
his
dogs
by
the
time
they
drew
him
into
brechin
would
have
done
two
heavy
days
work
and
would
deserve
the
comparative
holiday
he
meant
to
give
them
he
would
spend
in
the
town
with
his
pipes
in
the
company
of
that
congenial
circle
always
ready
to
spring
from
the
gutter
on
his
appearance
then
after
a
good
night
rest
and
when
he
should
have
collected
a
trifle
he
would
go
on
to
forfar
and
learn
for
certain
whether
archie
lived
at
ardguys
and
who
might
be
found
there
in
his
absence
his
idea
was
to
arrive
at
the
house
with
the
last
tidings
of
the
young
man
to
give
an
account
of
the
attack
on
the
its
surrender
flemington
injury
and
his
own
part
in
befriending
him
it
took
some
time
in
those
days
of
slow
communication
for
public
news
to
travel
so
much
as
across
a
county
but
even
should
the
tale
of
the
ship
have
reached
ardguys
the
news
of
archie
could
scarcely
have
preceded
him
he
hoped
to
find
someone
for
preference
an
anxious
mother
who
would
be
sensible
of
how
much
he
had
done
for
her
son
there
would
be
fresh
profit
there
and
not
only
profit
there
was
something
else
for
which
the
beggar
hoped
though
profit
was
his
main
object
he
pictured
some
tender
emotional
lady
from
whose
unsuspicious
heart
he
might
draw
scraps
of
information
that
would
fit
into
his
own
theories
he
would
try
the
effect
of
logie
name
and
there
would
be
no
harm
in
taking
a
general
survey
of
flemington
surroundings
and
picking
up
any
small
facts
about
him
that
he
could
collect
his
own
belief
in
archie
double
dealing
grew
stronger
as
he
jogged
along
no
doubt
that
shrewd
and
unaccountable
young
man
was
driving
a
stiff
trade
there
was
little
question
in
his
mind
that
the
contents
of
the
letter
he
had
put
into
his
hands
by
the
had
been
sold
to
captain
james
logie
and
that
its
immediate
result
had
been
the
taking
of
the
ship
he
had
learned
from
archie
ravings
that
there
had
been
a
question
of
money
between
himself
and
logie
the
part
that
he
could
make
nothing
of
was
the
suggestion
conveyed
by
archie
in
the
night
that
he
and
the
judge
brother
had
been
fighting
let
me
go
logie
he
had
cried
out
in
the
darkness
and
the
blow
on
his
forehead
which
was
bleeding
when
he
found
him
proved
recent
violence
but
though
he
could
not
explain
these
puzzles
nor
make
them
tally
with
his
belief
his
theory
remained
flemington
was
in
league
with
logie
for
the
present
he
determined
to
keep
his
suspicions
to
himself

three
days
afterwards
wattie
sat
at
the
gates
of
ardguys
and
looked
between
the
pale
yellow
at
the
house
there
was
nobody
about
at
the
moment
to
forbid
his
entrance
and
he
drove
quietly
in
at
a
foot
pace
and
approached
the
door
the
sun
shone
with
the
clear
lightness
of
autumn
and
the
leaves
which
had
almost
finished
the
fitful
process
of
falling
lay
gathered
in
heaps
by
the
gate
for
madam
flemington
liked
order
on
the
steep
pitch
of
the
ancient
slate
roof
a
few
pigeons
white
and
grey
sat
in
pairs
or
walked
about
with
spasmodic
dignity
the
whole
made
a
picture
high
in
tone
like
a
and
the
clean
etched
lines
of
the
stripped
branches
gave
it
a
sharp
delicacy
and
threw
up
the
tall
light
walls
all
these
things
were
lost
upon
the
beggar
he
had
informed
himself
in
forfar
he
knew
that
the
place
was
owned
and
lived
in
by
a
lady
of
the
name
of
flemington
who
was
the
grandmother
of
the
young
man
from
whom
he
had
lately
parted
he
had
learned
nothing
of
her
character
and
politics
because
of
the
seclusion
in
which
she
lived
and
he
stared
about
him
on
every
side
and
scanned
the
house
for
any
small
sign
that
might
give
him
a
clue
to
the
tastes
or
occupations
of
its
inhabitant
whilst
he
was
so
engaged

opened
and
the
sound
sent
all

from

roof
into
the
air
in
flashes
of
and
white
madam
flemington
stood
on
the
top
step
the
beggar
hand
went
instinctively
to
his
bonnet
he
was
a
little
taken
aback
why
he
did
not
know
and
he
instantly
abandoned
his
plan
of
an
emotional
description
of
archie
plight
she
stood
quite
still
looking
down
at
him
her
luxuriant
silver
hair
was
covered
by
a
piece
of
black
lace
that
was
tied
in
a
knot
under
her
chin
and
she
wore
the
or
hood
with
which
the
ladies
of
those
days
protected
their
headdresses
when
they
went
out
a
short
furred
cloak
was
round
her
she
considered
wattie
with
astonishment
then
she
beckoned
to
him
to
approach
who
and
what
are
you
she
asked
laying
her
hand
on
the
railing
that
encircled
the
landing
of
the
steps
that
question
was
so
seldom
put
to
him
that
it
struck
him
unawares
like
a
stone
from
behind
a
hedge
he
hesitated
a
got

for
yer
leddyship

began
i
asked

he

the

and

did
not
appeal
to
christian
but
this
amazing
intruder
was
like
no
one
she
had
ever
seen
before
she
guessed
that
he
was
a
beggar
and
she
brushed
aside
his
announcement
of
news
as
merely
a
method
of
attracting
attention
you
are
one
of
the
few
persons
in
these
parts
who
can
afford
to
keep

remarked
a

his
ribald
countenance
like
the
sun
irradiating
a

he
with

she
replied
rather
grimly

he
looking
at
the
place
where
his
legs
should
have
been
a
an
ill

for

she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
a
little
she
had
seen
no
one
for
months
with
the
exception
of
archie
who
was
so
quick
in
mind
and
speech
and
the
humour
of
this
vagabond
on
wheels
took
her
fancy
there
was
no
whining
servility
about
him
in
spite
of
his
obvious
profession
the
horrified
face
of
a
maidservant
appeared
for
one
moment
at
a
window
then
vanished
struck
back
by
the
unblessed
sight
of
her
mistress

the

for

of

he
said
he
lying
boldly
there
was
no
sign
of
emotion
none
even
of
surprise
on
her
face
her
heart
had
beaten
hard
as
the
beggar
talked
and
the
weight
of
wrath
and
pain
that
she
had
carried
since
she
had
parted
with
archie
began
to
lighten
he
had
listened
to
her
he
had
not
gone
against
her
how
deep
her
words
had
fallen
into
his
heart
she
could
not
tell
but
deep
enough
to
bring
him
to
grips
with
the
man
who
had
made
the
rift
between
them
are
you

but
there
wasna
muckle
wrang
wi
him
when
he
gae
awa
or
dod
a
wouldna
hae
left
him
he
had
no
mind
to
spoil
his
presentment
of
himself
as
good
samaritan
so
far
he
had
learnt
nothing
he
had
spoken
of
the
prince
men
as
rebels
without
a
sign
of
displeasure
showing
on
madam
face
archie
might
be
playing
a
double
game
and
she
might
be
doing
the
same
but
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
it
she
was
magnificently
impersonal
she
had
not
even
shown
the
natural
concern
that
he
expected
with
regard
to
her
own
flesh
and
blood
go
now
said
she
waving
her
hand
towards
the
back
part
of
the
house
you
shall
feed
well
you
and
your
dogs
and
when
you
have

you

steps
again

i
will
give

some
money
you

done
well
by

she
the
house
and
he
drove
away
to
the
dismissed
if
wattie
hoped
to
discover
anything
more
there
about
the
lady
and
her
household
he
was
disappointed
the
servants
raised
their
chins
in
refined
disapproval
of
the
vagrant
upon
whom
their
mistress
had
seen
fit
to
waste
words
under
the
very
front
windows
of
ardguys
they
resolved
that
he
should
find
the
socially
a
different
place
and
only
the
awe
in
which
they
stood
of
christian
compelled
them
to
obey
her
to
the
letter
a
crust
or
two
would
have
interpreted
her
wishes
had
they
dared
to
please
themselves
but
madam
flemington
knew
every
resource
of
her
larder
and
kitchen
for
french
housekeeping
and
the
frugality
of
her
exiled
years
had
taught
her
thrift
she
would
measure
precisely
what
had
been
given
to
her
egregious
guest
down
to
the
bones
laid
by
her
order
before
his
dogs
the
beggar
ate
in
silence
amid
the
brisk
cracking
made
by
five
pairs
of
busy
jaws
the
maids
were
in
the
stronghold
of
the
kitchen
far
from
the
ungenteel
sight
of
his
coarse
enjoyment
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
he
put
the
fragments
into
his
leathern
bag
and
went
round
once
more
to
the
front
of
the
house
a
window
was
open
on
the
and
madam
flemington
large
white
hand
came
over
the
sill
holding
a
couple
of
crown
pieces
she
was
sitting
on
the
within
her
cloak
and
the
calash
had
disappeared
and
wattie
could
see
the
fine
poise
of
her
head
she
dropped
the
coin
into
the
cart
as
he
drove
below
as
he
looked
up
he
thought
that
if
she
had
been
imposing
in
her
outdoor
garments
she
was
a
hundredfold
more
so
without
them
he
was
at
his
ease
with
her
but
he
wondered
at
it
though
he
was
accustomed
to
being
at
his
ease
with
everybody
a
certain
vanity
rose
in
him
coarse
remnant
of
humanity
as
he
was
before
this
magnificent
woman
and
when
he
had
received
the
silver
he
turned
about
facing
her
and
began
to
sing
he
was
used
to
the
plebeian
admiration
of
his
own
public
but
a
touch
of
it
from
her
would
have
a
different
flavour
he
was
vain
of
his
singing
and
that
vanity
was
the
one
piece
of
romance
belonging
to
him
it
hung
over
his
muddy
soul
as
a
weaving
of
honeysuckle
may
hang
over
a
dank
pond
had
he
understood
madam
flemington
perfectly
he
might
have
sung
tod
but
as
he
only
understood
her
superficially
he
sang
kirk
he
did
not
know
how
nearly
the
extremities
of
the
social
scale
can
draw
together
in
the
primitive
humours
of
humanity
it
is
the
ends
of
a
line
that
can
best
be
bent
to
meet
not
one
end
and
the
middle
yet
as
kirk
rang
out
among
the
spectral
she
sat
still
astonished
her
head
erect
like
some
royal
animal
listening
it
moved
her
though
its
sentiment
had
naught
to
do
with
her
mood
at
present
nor
with
her
cast
of
mind
at
any
time
but
love
and
loss
are
things
that
lay
their
shadows
everywhere
and
madam
flemington
had
lost
much
moreover
she
had
been
a
woman
framed
for
love
and
she
had
not
wasted
her
gifts
as
his
voice
ceased
she
rose
and
threw
the
window
up
higher
go
on
she
said
he
paused
taking
breath
for
a
couple
of
minutes
he
knew
songs
to
suit
all
political
creeds
but
this
time
he
would
try
one
of
the
jacobite
lays
that
were
floating
round
the
country
if
it
should
provoke
some
illuminating
comment
from
her
he
would
have
learned
something
more
about
her
and
incidentally
about
archie
though
it
struck
him
that
he
was
not
so
sure
of
the
unanimity
of
interest
between
the
grandmother
and
grandson
which
he
had
taken
for
granted
before
seeing
madam
flemington
his
cunning
eyes
were
rooted
on
her
as
he
sang
again
my
love

you
sing
well
said
christian
when
he
had
stopped
now
go
she
inclined
her
head
and
turned
from
the
window
as
his
broad
back
so
grotesque
in
its
strange
nearness
to
the
ground
passed
out
between
the
of
ardguys
she
went
over
to
the
mantelpiece
her
face
was
set
and
she
stood
with
clasped
hands
gazing
into
the
fireplace
she
was
deeply
moved
but
not
by
the
song
which
only
stirred
her
to
bitterness
but
by
the
searching
tones
of
the
voice
that
had
smitten
a
way
through
which
her
feelings
surged
to
and
from
her
heart
the
thought
that
archie
had
not
utterly
broken
away
from
her
unnerved
her
by
the
very
relief
it
brought
she
had
not
known
till
now
how
much
she
had
suffered
from
what
had
passed
between
them
her
power
was
not
all
gone
she
was
not
quite
alone
she
would
have
scorned
to
admit
that
she
could
not
stand
in
complete
isolation
and
she
admitted
nothing
even
to
herself
she
only
stood
still
her
nerves
quivering
making
no
outward
sign
presently
she
rang
a
little
that
was
on
the
table
the
maid
appeared
mysie
said
madam
flemington
in
three
days
i
shall
go
to
edinburgh
chapter
xvii
society
lord
balnillo
looked
out
of
his
sedan
chair
as
it
emerged
from
the
darkness
of
a
close
on
the
northern
slope
of
the
old
town
of
edinburgh
far
down
in
front
of
him
where
the
long
alley
stopped
a
light
or
two
was
seen
reflected
in
the
black
water
of
the
nor
loch
that
lay
between
the
ancient
city
and
the
ground
on
which
the
new
one
was
so
soon
to
rise
the
shuffling
footfalls
of
his
chairmen
echoing
off
the
sides
of
the
covered
entry
were
drowned
in
the
noise
that
was
going
on
a
little
way
farther
forward
where
the
close
widened
out
into
a
square
courtyard
one
side
of
this
place
was
taken
up
by
the
house
of
lady
anne
maxwell
for
which
the
judge
was
bound
it
had
been
raining
and
edinburgh
was
most
noisomely
dirty
under
foot
so
balnillo
regard
for
his
legs
and
the
buckled
shoes
on
his
slim
feet
had
made
him
decide
to
be
carried
to
his
kinswoman
party
he
wore
his
favourite
mouse
colour
but
the
waistcoat
under
his
velvet
coat
was
of
primrose
satin
and
the
lace
under
his
chin
had
cost
him
more
than
he
liked
to
remember
the
courtyard
sent
up
a
glow
of
light
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
damp
evening
for
the
high
houses
towering
round
it
rose
black
into
the
sky
limiting
the
shine
and
concentrating
it
into
one
patch
from
above
it
must
have
looked
like
a
dimly
illuminated
well
it
was
full
of
sedan
chairs
footmen
and
caddies
and
the
chattering
pushing
jesting
and
oaths
were
keeping
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighbouring
such
of
them
as
were
awake
for
edinburgh
kept
early
hours
in
those
days
from
going
to
sleep
the
sedan
chairs
were
set
down
at
the
door
for
they
could
seldom
be
carried
into
the
low
and
narrow
entrances
of
even
the
best
town
houses
and
here
at
lady
anne
the
staircase
wound
up
inside
a
circular
tower
projecting
from
the
wall
the
caddies
or
of
edinburgh
that
strange
brotherhood
of
useful
omniscient
rascals
without
whose
services
nothing
could
prosper
ran
in
and
out
among
the
crowd
in
search
of
odd
jobs
their
eyes
were
everywhere
their
ears
heard
everything
their
tongues
carried
news
of
every
event
the
caddies
knew
all
that
happened
in
society
on
the
bench
in
shops
in
wynds
in
churches
and
no
traveller
could
be
an
hour
in
the
town
before
they
had
made
his
name
and
business
common
property
in
an
hour
and
a
half
his
character
would
have
gone
the
same
way
their
home
by
day
was
at
the
market
cross
in
the
high
street
where
they
stood
in
gossiping
groups
until
a
call
let
one
of
them
loose
upon
somebody
else
business
it
was
the
perpetual
pursuit
of
other
people
business
that
had
made
them
what
they
were
a
knot
of
caddies
pressed
round
the
door
of
lady
anne
maxwell
house
as
lord
balnillo
sitting
erect
in
order
not
to
crease
his
clothes
and
looking
rather
like
an
image
carried
in
a
procession
was
kept
at
a
standstill
whilst
another
guest
was
set
down
through
the
open
window
of
his
chair
there
pressed
a
couple
of
inquisitive
faces
hey
lads
cried
a
caddie
it
davie
balnillo
back
again
losh

he

balnillo
nodded
affably
the
instant
recognition
pleased
the
old
man
for
he
had
only
reached
edinburgh
in
time
to
dress
for
his
party
also
lord
grange
was
a
friend
of
his
and
he
was
glad
to
hear
that
he
was
in
front
as
he
looked
complacently
upon
the
crowd
his
chairmen
suddenly
stepped
forward
almost
throwing
him
out
of
his
seat
a
cry
rose
round
him
canny
canny
ye
hieland
deevils
ye
hae
the
pouthered
wiggie
him
swiggit
aff
his
heed
haud
on
davie
we
no
let
ye
cowp
balnillo
was
rather
annoyed
for
he
had
been
knocked
smartly
against
the
and
a
little
cloud
of
powder
had
been
shaken
on
his
velvet
sleeve
but
he
knew
that
the
one
thing
a
man
might
not
lose
before
the
caddies
was
his
temper
if
he
did
not
want
his
rage
his
gestures
and
all
the
humiliating
details
of
his
discomfiture
to
be
the
town
talk
next
day
he
looked
as
bland
as
he
could
while
he
resettled
himself
it
no
be
waur
nor
ridin
the
circuit
ma
lord
inquired
a
voice
a
laugh
went
round
the
group
and
the
chair
moved
on
and
was
set
down
at
its
destination
though
the
caddies
knowledge
of
the
judge
went
as
far
down
as
his
foibles
the
one
thing
that
they
did
not
happen
to
know
was
the
motive
that
had
brought
him
to
edinburgh
the
doings
in
the
harbour
had
disturbed
balnillo
mightily
for
though
the
success
of
ferrier
and
james
in
taking
the
rejoiced
him
he
was
dismayed
by
what
he
had
heard
about
archie
flemington
his
brother
had
told
him
everything
when
captain
hall
and
his
men
had
been
conveyed
as
prisoners
to
the
town
and
the
ship
had
been
taken
possession
of
by
prince
charles
agent
in
montrose
logie
had
gone
hastily
to
balnillo
to
give
the
news
to
david
and
to
prepare
for
his
own
departure
to
join
the
stuart
army
there
was
no
longer
any
need
for
secrecy
on
his
part
and
it
had
always
been
his
intention
to
declare
himself
openly
as
soon
as
he
had
done
his
work
in
montrose
the
place
was
well
protected
and
besides
the
town
guns
that
he
and
ferrier
had
taken
from
hall
there
were
the
two
armed
vessels
both
now
belonging
to
the
prince
lying
in
the
harbour
the
arrival
of
the
frigate
with
her
supplies
had
turned
montrose
from
a
town
into
a
declared
jacobite
stronghold
the
streets
and
taverns
were
full
of
lord
john
drummond
troops
the
citizens
had
given
vent
to
their
feelings
upon
the
town
bells
bonfires
blazed
in
the
streets
and
prince
charlie
name
was
on
every
lip
girls
wore
white
roses
on
their
breasts
and
dreamed
at
night
of
the
fascinating
young
spark
who
had
come
to
set
scotland
alight
the
intense
jacobitism
of
angus
seemed
to
have
culminated
in
the
quiet
seaport
in
all
this
outburst
of
loyalty
and
excitement
the
cautious
balnillo
did
not
know
what
to
do
the
risk
of
announcing
his
leanings
publicly
was
a
greater
one
than
he
cared
to
take
for
his
stake
in
the
country
and
the
land
was
considerable
and
he
was
neither
sanguine
enough
to
feel
certain
of
the
ultimate
triumph
of
the
stuarts
like
the
montrose
people
nor
generous
enough
to
disregard
all
results
like
james
as
he
told
himself
after
much
deliberation
he
was
best
away
he
had
heard
from
james
of
archie
sudden
appearance
upon
the
island
armed
with
a
government
weapon
and
in
company
with
the
attacking
force
from
the
ship
and
had
listened
to
james
grim
denunciation
of
him
as
a
spy
his
passionate
regrets
that
he
had
not
blown
his
brains
out
there
and
then
james
bitterness
had
been
so
great
that
david
told
himself
he
could
scarcely
recognize
his
quiet
brother
there
was
abundant
reason
for
it
but
logie
had
seemed
to
be
beside
himself
he
had
scarcely
eaten
or
slept
during
the
short
time
that
he
had
been
with
him
and
his
face
had
kept
the
judge
tongue
still
after
his
account
of
what
had
happened
balnillo
had
not
returned
to
the
subject
again
step
by
step
the
judge
had
gone
over
all
the
circumstances
of
flemington
sudden
emergence
from
the
den
on
that
windy
night
and
had
seen
how
he
had
himself
been
cozened
and
flattered
into
the
business
of
the
portrait
which
stood
unfinished
in
solitary
and
very
marked
dignity
in
the
room
with
the
north
light
he
was
a
man
who
suspected
some
of
his
own
weaknesses
though
his
knowledge
did
not
prevent
him
from
giving
way
to
them
when
he
thought
he
could
do
so
safely
and
he
remembered
the
adroit
bits
of
flattery
that
his
guest
had
strewn
in
his
path
and
how
obligingly
he
had
picked
them
up
he
was
shrewd
enough
to
see
all
that
he
thought
of
the
sudden
departure
when
madam
flemington
mysterious
illness
had
spirited
archie
out
of
the
house
at
a
moment
notice
and
he
saw
how
he
had
contrived
to
imbue
both
himself
and
james
with
the
idea
that
he
shared
their
political
interests
without
saying
one
definite
word
he
thought
of
his
sigh
and
the
change
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
of
his
father
death
in
exile
with
his
master
these
things
stood
up
in
a
row
before
balnillo
and
ranged
themselves
into
a
sinister
whole
the
plain
truth
of
it
was
that
he
had
entertained
a
devil
unawares
there
had
been
a
great
search
for
flemington
when
the
skirmish
on
inchbrayock
was
over
it
was
only
ceasing
when
the
french
frigate
swam
into
the
like
a
huge
and
james
plunged
in
the
struggle
was
unable
to
spare
a
thought
to
the
antagonist
he
had
flung
from
him
at
the
first
sound
of
the
attack
but
when
the
firing
had
stopped
and
the
appearance
of
the
foreign
ship
made
the
issue
of
the
conflict
certain
he
returned
to
the
spot
where
he
had
left
archie
and
found
him
gone
he
examined
the
sand
for
some
trace
of
the
vanished
man
feet
but
the
tide
was
now
high
in
the
river
and
his
footprints
had
been
swallowed
by
the
incoming
rush
the
were
completely
covered
and
he
knew
that
these
great
fragments
of
rock
as
they
were
would
now
be
lying
under
enough
water
to
drown
a
man
who
should
miss
his
footing
while
the
tide
surged
through
this
narrow
stretch
of
the
esk
bed
he
guessed
that
the
spy
had
escaped
by
them
though
a
short
time
later
the
attempt
would
have
been
impossible
he
made
a
hasty
search
of
the
island
and
finding
no
sign
of
flemington
he
returned
with
his
men
and
the
prisoners
they
had
taken
leaving
the
dead
to
be
carried
over
later
to
the
town
for
burial
the
boats
were
on
the
montrose
side
of
inchbrayock
and
their
progress
being
hampered
by
the
wounded
some
time
was
lost
before
he
could
spare
a
handful
of
followers
to
begin
the
search
for
flemington
he
picked
up
a
few
volunteers
upon
the
quays
and
despatched
them
immediately
to
cross
the
strait
and
to
search
the
southern
shores
of
both
the
river
and
the
basin
but
they
had
barely
started
when
flemington
and
the
beggar
were
nearing
the
little
farm
on
rossie
moor
archie
had
spent
so
little
time
on
the
open
road
thanks
to
his
companion
advice
that
none
of
those
whom
the
pursuers
met
and
questioned
had
seen
him
before
dusk
came
on
their
zeal
had
flagged
and
though
one
than
his
comrades
had
suggested
the
moor
as
a
likely
goal
for
their
quarry
he
had
been
overborne
by
their
determination
that
the
fugitive
a
man
who
had
been
described
to
them
as
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
county
would
make
in
that
direction
when
james
had
gone
to
join
the
stuart
army
on
its
march
to
england
his
brother
waiting
until
the
prince
had
left
holyrood
set
forth
for
edinburgh
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
him
to
remain
at
home
within
sound
of
the
noisy
rejoicings
of
montrose
without
either
joining
in
the
general
exultation
or
holding
himself
conspicuously
aloof
prudence
and
convenience
pointed
to
the
taking
of
a
little
holiday
and
his
own
inclination
did
not
gainsay
them
he
had
not
been
in
edinburgh
since
his
retirement
and
the
notion
of
going
there
once
formed
grew
more
and
more
to
his
taste
a
hundred
things
in
his
old
haunts
drew
him
gossip
the
liberal
tables
of
his
former
colleagues
the
latest
modes
in
coats
and
cravats
the
musical
assemblies
at
which
he
had
himself
performed
upon
the
flute
the
scandals
and
anecdotes
of
the
parliament
house
and
the
society
of
elegant
women
he
loved
all
these
though
his
trees
and
parks
had
taken
their
places
of
late
he
loved
james
too
and
the
year
they
had
spent
together
had
been
agreeable
to
him
but
politics
and
family
affection
the
latter
of
the
general
rather
than
the
individual
kind
strong
as
their
bonds
were
could
not
bring
the
brothers
into
true
touch
with
each
other
james
was
preoccupied
silent
restless
and
david
had
sometimes
felt
him
to
be
inhuman
in
his
lack
of
interest
in
small
things
and
in
his
carelessness
of
all
but
the
great
events
of
life
and
now
as
balnillo
stepped
forth
at
lady
anne
door
he
was
hugging
himself
at
the
prospect
of
his
return
to
the
trimmings
and
embroideries
of
existence
he
walked
up
the
circular
staircase
and
emerged
into
the
of
the
long
low
room
in
which
his
cousin
guests
were
assembled
lady
anne
was
a
youngish
widow
with
a
good
fortune
and
a
devouring
passion
for
cards
she
had
all
the
means
of
indulging
her
taste
for
not
only
did
she
know
every
living
being
who
went
to
the
making
of
edinburgh
society
but
unlike
most
of
her
neighbours
she
owned
the
whole
of
the
house
in
which
she
lived
and
consequently
had
space
wherein
to
entertain
them
while
nearly
all
the
edinburgh
world
dwelt
in
its
flat
and
while
many
greater
ladies
than
herself
were
contented
to
receive
their
guests
in
their
bedchambers
and
to
dance
and
drink
tea
in
rooms
not
much
bigger
than
the
boudoirs
of
their
descendants
lady
anne
could
have
received
prince
charles
edward
himself
in
suitable
circumstances
had
she
been
so
minded
but
she
was
very
far
from
having
any
such
aspiration
and
had
not
set
foot
in
holyrood
while
the
prince
was
there
for
she
was
a
staunch
whig
as
she
greeted
her
cousin
balnillo
she
was
wondering
how
far
certain
rumours
that
she
had
heard
about
him
were
true
and
whether
he
also
had
been
privy
to
the
taking
of
the
in
montrose
harbour
for
it
was
just
a
week
since
the
news
of
logie
exploit
had
reached
edinburgh
one
of
david
many
reasons
for
coming
to
her
party
was
his
desire
to
make
his
reappearance
in
the
polite
world
in
a
markedly
whig
house
he
stood
talking
to
lord
grange
in
the
room
half
full
of
people
through
an
open
door
another
smaller
apartment
could
be
seen
crowded
with
tables
and
lady
anne
all
of
whose
guests
were
arrived
had
vanished
into
it
and
the
two
judges
stood
side
by
side
lord
grange
who
valued
his
reputation
for
sanctity
above
rubies
did
not
play
cards
at
least
not
openly
and
balnillo
discovering
new
faces
as
those
must
who
have
been
over
a
year
absent
from
any
community
was
glad
to
have
him
at
his
elbow
to
answer
questions
silks
rustled
fans
clicked
and
the
medley
of
noises
in
the
court
below
came
up
though
the
windows
were
shut
the
candles
dim
enough
to
our
modern
standards
of
lighting
shone
against
the
darkness
of
polished
wood
and
laughter
and
talk
were
escaping
like
running
water
out
of
a
thicket
from
a
knot
of
people
gathered
round
a
small
plump
woman
the
group
was
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
now
and
again
an
individual
would
detach
himself
from
it
to
return
drawn
by
some
jest
that
reached
him
ere
he
had
crossed
the
floor
cockburn
wit
has
not
rusted
this
twelvemonth
observed
lord
grange
i
marvel
she
has
any
left
after
nine
years
of
housekeeping
with
her
straitlaced
replied
balnillo
in
a
preoccupied
voice
his
eyes
were
elsewhere
ah
said
grange
pulling
a
righteous
face
the
group
round
cockburn
opened
and
she
caught
sight
of
him
for
the
first
time
she
bowed
and
smiled
civilly
showing
her
rather
prominent
teeth
then
noticing
balnillo
she
came
over
to
the
two
men
her
friends
stepped
apart
to
let
her
pass
watching
her
go
with
that
touch
of
proprietary
pride
which
a
small
intimate
society
feels
in
its
more
original
members
it
was
evident
that
her
least
acts
were
deemed
worthy
of
observation
as
she
greeted
david
he
turned
round
with
a
low
bow
my
lord
i
thought
you
were
buried
she
exclaimed
dead
and
buried
droned
grange
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
not
dead
exclaimed
she
else
i
had
been
in
mourning
balnillo
bowed
again
bringing
his
attention
back
with
a
jerk
from
the
direction
in
which
it
had
been
fixed
come
my
lord
what
have
you
been
doing
all
this
long
time
i
have
been
endeavouring
to
improve
my
estate
and
meanwhile
you
have
left
us
to
deteriorate
for
shame
sir
edinburgh
morals
are
safe
in
lord
grange
hands
rejoined
balnillo
with
a
sudden
flash
of
slyness
cockburn
smiled
behind
her
fan
there
were
odd
stories
afloat
about
grange
she
looked
appreciatively
at
balnillo
he
had
not
changed
in
spite
of
his
country
life
he
was
as
dapper
as
ineffective
and
as
unexpected
as
ever
she
preferred
him
infinitely
to
grange
fie
davie
broke
in
the
latter
with
a
leer
you
are
an
ungallant
dog
here
is
cockburn
wasting
her
words
on
you
and
you
do
nothing
but
ogle
the
lady
yonder
by
the
window
three
pairs
of
eyes
the
bright
ones
of
cockburn
the
rather
furtive
ones
of
balnillo
and
the
sanctimonious
orbs
of
lord
grange
turned
in
one
direction
cockburn
is
all
knowledge
as
she
is
all
goodness
observed
the
last
named
pompously
pray
tell
us
who
is
that
lady
chapter

finds
perfection
a
sconce
of
candles
beside
a
shed
a
collective
illumination
from
the
wall
and
christian
flemington
stood
full
in
their
light
contemplating
the
company
with
superb
detachment
and
pervaded
by
that
air
which
never
left
her
of
facing
the
world
unaided
and
unabashed
with
such
advantages
as
god
had
given
her
her
neck
still
white
and
firm
was
bare
for
she
wore
no
jewels
but
the
ruby
earrings
which
shot
sparks
around
her
when
she
moved
long
necks
were
in
fashion
in
those
days
and
hers
was
rather
short
but
the
carriage
of
her
head
added
enough
to
its
length
to
do
more
than
equalize
the
difference
her
hair
was
like
massed
silver
and
her
flesh
of
which
a
good
deal
could
be
seen
rose
like
ivory
above
the
of
her
silk
gown
which
flowed
in
spreading
folds
from
her
waist
to
the
ground
a
spanish
fan
with
carved
tortoiseshell
sticks
a
thing
of
mellow
browns
and
golds
was
half
closed
between
her
fingers
when
she
opened
it
it
displayed
the
picture
of
a
that
is
flemington
madam
flemington
as
i
am
told
many
people
call
her
i
presume
because
she
came
to
scotland
from
france
you
should
know
her
my
lord
she
added
addressing
balnillo
you
are
from
angus
but
balnillo
was
speechless
grange
who
was
transferring
a
pinch
of
snuff
from
his
box
to
his
nose
paused
his
hand
midway
way
between
the
two
is
she
the
widow
of
andrew
flemington
who
was
in
france
with
king
james
the
same
replied
cockburn
tossing
her
head
she
had
small
sympathy
with
the
stuarts
i
had
not
expected
to
see
the
lady
here
not
that
i
know
aught
about
her
views
we
have
a
bare
acquaintance
and
she
is
like
yourself
lord
balnillo
just
arrived
in
edinburgh
when
our
young
hero
has
left
holyrood
she
has
been
a
fine
woman
said
lord
grange
his
eye
kindling
you
may
use
the
present
tense
my
lord
said
cockburn
aha
sniggered
grange
who
adhered
to
the
beliefs
of
his
sex
you
dare
to
show
yourself
generous
i
dare
to
show
myself
what
i
am
and
that
is
more
than
all
the
world
can
do
said
she
looking
at
him
very
hard
he
shifted
from
foot
to
foot
at
this
moment
the
gallows
to
which
he
had
condemned
a
few
people
in
his
time
struck
him
as
a
personal
inconvenience
said
he
swallowing
his
rage
you
must
present
davie
or
he
will
lose
what
senses
he
has
come
then
my
lord
i
will
befriend
you
said
she
glad
of
the
chance
to
be
rid
of
grange
balnillo
followed
her
unable
to
escape
had
he
wished
to
do
so
christian
was
a
woman
who
stood
very
still
she
turned
her
head
without
turning
her
body
as
cockburn
approached
with
her
request
and
balnillo
saw
her
calm
acquiescence
his
breath
had
been
almost
taken
away
as
he
learned
the
identity
of
the
stranger
here
was
the
woman
who
knew
everything
about
that
astounding
young
man
his
late
guest
whose
alarming
illness
had
recalled
him
who
had
lived
at
germain
with
the
exiled
queen
yet
who
was
the
grandmother
of
a
most
audacious
whig
spy
there
was
no
trace
of
recent
here
he
had
pictured
some
faint
feeble
shred
of
old
womanhood
not
the
commanding
creature
whose
grey
eyes
were
considering
him
as
he
advanced
under
cover
of
her
leisurely
consent
she
seemed
to
measure
him
carelessly
as
he
stood
before
her
he
was
torn
asunder
in
mind
awestruck
dragged
this
way
by
his
surprised
admiration
that
way
by
his
intense
desire
to
wring
from
her
something
about
flemington
here
was
a
chance
indeed
but
balnillo
felt
his
courage
drown
in
the
rising
fear
of
being
unable
to
profit
by
that
chance
admiring
bewilderment
overcame
every
other
feeling
he
no
longer
regretted
the
price
he
had
paid
for
the
lace
on
his
cravat
his
name
had
roused
madam
flemington
though
she
gave
no
sign
of
the
thrill
that
went
through
her
as
it
fell
from
cockburn
lips
as
david
stood
before
her
in
the
correct
yet
sober
foppery
of
his
primrose
and
she
regretted
that
she
was
quite
ignorant
of
the
pretext
on
which
archie
had
left
his
picture
unfinished
nor
upon
what
terms
he
had
parted
with
the
judge
she
had
no
reason
for
supposing
balnillo
to
be
aware
of
the
young
man
real
character
he
had
been
fighting
with
james
logie
according
to
skirling
wattie
yet
there
seemed
to
be
no
enmity
in
the
business
for
here
was
his
brother
lord
balnillo
assiduous
in
getting
himself
presented
to
her
cockburn
had
put
her
request
with
a
smiling
hint
at
the
effect
she
had
produced
on
his
lordship
christian
glanced
at
meticulous
person
and
smiled
arrogantly
civil
secretly
anxious
and
remained
silent
ready
to
follow
his
lead
with
caution
the
shrewd
side
of
balnillo
was
uppermost
stimulated
perhaps
by
the
sight
of
society
and
by
the
exhilarating
sound
of
its
voice
he
recovered
his
momentarily
scattered
wits
and
determined
to
approach
his
new
acquaintance
with
such
direct
and
simple
questions
as
might
seem
to
her
to
be
the
natural
inquiries
of
a
man
interested
in
flemington
and
innocent
of
any
mystery
concerning
him
it
was
quite
possible
so
he
reasoned
that
she
was
unaware
of
the
details
of
what
had
happened
on
inchbrayock
island
archie
had
fled
and
the
search
for
him
had
produced
no
result
he
was
unlikely
to
have
made
for
his
own
home
if
he
did
not
wish
to
be
found
and
he
and
madam
flemington
might
not
have
met
since
the
affair
of
the
it
should
be
his
balnillo
task
to
convince
her
of
his
ignorance
his
intense
curiosity
about
archie
was
almost
stronger
than
his
wrath
against
him
unlike
james
whose
bitterness
was
too
deep
for
words
whose
soul
was
driven
before
the
fury
of
his
own
feelings
like
a
restless
ghost
david
still
looked
back
with
a
certain
pleasant
excitement
to
flemington
meteoric
flash
through
the
even
atmosphere
of
his
daily
life
he
would
dearly
have
liked
to
bring
him
to
justice
but
he
was
anxious
to
hear
a
little
more
of
him
first
he
had
a
curious
mixture
of
feelings
about
him
there
was
no
vainer
man
in
scotland
than
balnillo
and
if
the
mental
half
of
his
vanity
had
suffered
from
the
deception
practised
on
it
the
physical
half
was
yet
preening
itself
in
the
sunny
remembrance
of
the
portrait
at
home
the
portrait
of
david
balnillo
as
he
would
fain
have
had
the
world
see
him
the
portrait
alas
and
alas
unfinished
he
could
not
feel
quite
as
james
felt
who
had
opened
his
purse
and
more
far
more
than
that
had
laid
open
the
most
sacred
page
of
his
life
before
flemington
he
had
placed
his
personal
safety
in
his
hands
too
though
he
counted
that
as
a
matter
of
less
moment
madam
said
balnillo
to
see
you
is
to
rejoice
that
you
have
recovered
from
your
serious
illness
you
are
very
obliging
my
lord
i
am
quite
well
replied
christian
concealing
a
slight
surprise
at
this
remark
i
am
most
happy
in
being
presented
to
you
he
continued
what
news
have
you
of
my
charming
friend
flemington
may
i
ask
when
i
heard
your
name
my
lord
i
determined
to
be
acquainted
with
you
if
only
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
to
my
boy
he
could
not
say
enough
of
yourself
and
your
brother
i
hope
captain
logie
is
well
is
he
with
you
this
evening
the
mention
of
james
acted
on
david
as
he
had
designed
that
the
mention
of
archie
should
act
on
madam
flemington
these
two
people
who
were
playing
at
innocence
were
using
the
names
of
their
relations
to
scare
the
enemy
as
savage
tribes
use
the
terrific
faces
painted
on
their
shields
balnillo
in
beginning
the
attack
had
forgotten
his
own
weak
point
and
he
remembered
that
he
could
give
no
satisfactory
account
of
his
brother
at
the
present
moment
but
his
cunning
was
always
at
hand
i
had
half
expected
to
see
him
here
said
he
peering
round
the
room
there
was
some
talk
of
his
coming
i
arrived
somewhat
late
and
i
have
hardly
spoken
to
anyone
but
my
lord
grange
and
cockburn
the
sight
of
yourself
put
other
matters
out
of
my
head
ah
sir
exclaimed
christian
i
fear
that
your
ardour
was
all
on
behalf
of
archie
but
i
am
accustomed
to
that
she
cast
a
look
of
indolent
raillery
at
him
drawing
back
her
head
and
veiling
her
eyes
fiery
and
seductive
still
with
the
momentary
sweep
of
their
thick
lashes
balnillo
threw
out
his
chest
like
a
pouter
pigeon
he
had
not
been
so
happy
for
a
long
time
as
he
did
so
she
remembered
archie
account
of
his
silk
legs
and
his
description
of
him
as
being
silly
virtuous
and
cunning
all
at
once
silly
she
could
well
believe
him
to
be
virtuous
he
might
be
whether
he
was
cunning
or
not
time
would
show
her
she
did
not
mean
to
let
him
go
until
she
had
at
least
attempted
to
hear
more
about
james
logie
madam
said
he
since
seeing
you
i
have
forgotten
flemington
can
i
say
more
so
far
she
was
completely
puzzled
as
to
how
much
he
knew
about
archie
but
it
was
beginning
to
enter
her
mind
that
her
own
illness
of
which
she
had
just
learned
from
him
had
been
the
young
man
pretext
for
leaving
his
work
when
it
was
only
begun
why
else
had
the
judge
mentioned
it
and
who
but
flemington
could
have
put
the
idea
into
his
head
she
determined
to
make
a
bold
attack
on
possibilities
archie
was
distracted
by
my
illness
poor
boy
and
i
fear
that
your
lordship
portrait
suffered
but
you
will
understand
his
anxiety
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
the
only
living
relation
that
he
has
and
that
his
devotion
to
me
he
needs
no
excuse
cried
david
fervently
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
i
am
still
hardly
myself
she
said
i
can
not
stand
long
fetch
me
a
chair
my
lord
he
skipped
across
the
floor
and
laid
hold
upon
one
just
in
time
for
a
gentleman
was
on
the
point
of
claiming
it
he
carried
it
back
with
the
air
of
a
conqueror
apart
by
the
curtain
if
you
please
said
christian
waving
her
hand
we
can
speak
more
comfortably
on
the
fringe
of
this
rout
of
chattering
people
he
set
the
chair
down
in
a
quiet
place
by
the
wall
and
she
settled
herself
upon
it
leaning
back
her
shoulder
turned
from
the
company
balnillo
delight
deepened
and
the
portrait
my
lord
he
did
not
tell
me
what
arrangement
had
been
made
for
finishing
it
said
christian
looking
up
at
him
as
he
stood
beside
her
she
seemed
to
be
completely
unconcerned
and
she
spoke
with
a
leisurely
dignity
and
ease
that
turned
his
ideas
upside
down
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
she
appeared
to
court
the
subject
of
archie
and
the
picture
he
could
only
guess
her
to
be
innocent
and
his
warm
admiration
helped
his
belief
at
no
moment
since
he
knew
the
truth
from
his
brother
lips
had
archie
character
seemed
so
black
as
it
did
now
david
indignation
waxed
as
he
grew
more
certain
that
flemington
had
deceived
the
noble
woman
to
whom
he
owed
so
much
even
as
he
had
deceived
him
he
was
becoming
so
sure
of
it
that
he
had
no
desire
to
enlighten
her
he
longed
to
ask
plainly
where
archie
was
but
he
hesitated
even
the
cockburn
was
ignorant
of
this
lady
political
sympathies
and
knew
her
only
as
the
widow
of
a
loyal
exile
what
might
what
would
be
her
feelings
if
she
were
to
see
her
grandson
in
his
real
character
righteous
anger
smouldered
under
balnillo
primrose
waistcoat
and
his
spasmodic
shrewdness
began
to
doze
in
the
increasing
warmth
of
his
chivalrous
pity
for
this
new
and
interesting
victim
of
the
engaging
rogue
flemington
concern
was
so
great
when
he
left
my
house
that
no
arrangement
was
made
said
he
i
had
not
the
heart
to
trouble
him
with
my
unimportant
affairs
when
so
much
was
at
stake
of
the
two
cautious
people
who
were
feeling
their
way
in
the
dark
it
was
the
judge
who
was
the
more
mystified
for
he
had
laid
hold
of
a
definite
idea
and
it
was
the
wrong
one
christian
was
merely
putting
a
bold
face
on
a
hazardous
matter
and
hoping
to
hear
something
of
logie
she
had
not
sought
the
introduction
david
would
have
been
the
butt
of
her
amused
scorn
had
she
been
free
enough
from
anxiety
to
be
entertained
but
she
could
not
imagine
on
what
footing
matters
really
stood
and
she
was
becoming
inclined
to
suspect
the
beggar
statement
that
flemington
had
been
fighting
with
james
her
longing
to
see
archie
was
great
she
loved
him
in
her
own
way
though
she
had
driven
him
from
her
in
her
mortification
and
her
furious
pride
she
had
not
believed
that
he
would
really
go
there
and
then
that
he
who
had
served
her
purposes
so
gallantly
all
his
life
would
take
her
at
her
word
what
was
he
doing
why
had
he
gone
to
edinburgh
her
own
reason
for
coming
had
been
the
hope
of
seeing
him
she
had
been
four
days
in
the
town
now
and
she
dared
not
make
open
inquiries
for
him
not
knowing
how
far
his
defection
had
gone
she
had
accused
him
of
turning
to
the
stuarts
and
he
had
denied
the
accusation
not
angrily
but
with
quiet
firmness
two
horrible
possibilities
had
occurred
to
her
one
that
he
was
with
the
prince
and
might
be
already
known
to
the
government
as
a
rebel
the
other
that
he
had
never
reached
edinburgh
that
his
hurt
had
been
worse
than
the
beggar
supposed
and
that
he
might
be
ill
or
dying
perhaps
dead
but
it
was
only
when
she
lay
awake
at
night
that
she
imagined
these
things
in
saner
moments
and
by
daylight
she
put
them
from
her
she
was
so
well
accustomed
to
being
parted
from
him
and
to
the
knowledge
that
he
was
on
risky
business
that
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
really
disturbed
she
assured
herself
that
she
must
wait
and
watch
and
now
she
was
glad
to
find
herself
acquainted
with
balnillo
who
seemed
to
be
the
only
clue
in
her
hand
mercifully
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
being
an
old
fool
i
see
that
you
are
too
modest
to
tell
me
anything
of
the
picture
she
began
i
hope
it
promised
well
you
should
make
a
fine
portrait
and
i
believe
that
archie
could
do
you
justice
he
is
at
his
best
with
high
types
describe
it
to
me
david
espied
a
vacant
chair
and
drawing
it
towards
him
sat
down
to
the
subject
with
the
same
gusto
that
most
men
bring
to
their
dinners
he
cleared
his
throat
i
should
have
wished
it
to
be
full
length
said
he
but
flemington
had
no
suitable
canvas
with
him
i
wore
my
robes
and
he
was
good
enough
to
say
that
the
crimson
was
appropriate
and
becoming
to
me
personally
i
favour
quiet
colours
as
you
see
i
see
that
you
have
excellent
taste
he
bowed
delighted
i
remarked
you
as
you
came
in
continued
she
and
i
asked
myself
why
these
gentlemen
looked
so
garish
observe
that
one
beside
the
door
of
the
my
lord
i
am
sure
that
he
chose
his
finery
with
some
care
yet
he
reminds
me
of
a
clown
at
a
merrymaking
true
true
excellently
true
in
my
youth
it
was
the
man
of
the
world
who
set
the
fashions
now
it
is
the
tailor
and
the
young
sir
fresh
from
his
studies
what
should
these
persons
know
of
the
subject
balnillo
was
in
heaven
from
force
of
habit
he
ran
his
hand
down
the
leg
crossed
upon
his
knee
the
familiar
inward
curve
of
the
slim
silk
ankle
between
his
fingers
was
like
the
touch
of
a
tried
and
creditable
friend
it
might
almost
be
said
that
he
turned
to
it
for
sympathy
he
would
have
liked
to
tell
his
ankle
that
he
had
found
a
perfection
almost
as
great
as
its
own
lord
grange
who
had
taken
leave
of
his
hostess
and
was
departing
paused
to
look
at
him
see
said
he
taking
an
acquaintance
by
the
elbow
look
yonder
at
that
doited
davie
balnillo
he
is
telling
her
about
his
riding
of
the
circuit
said
the
other
grinning
the
circuit
never
made
him
smile
like
that
replied
grange
sardonically
an
hour
later
christian
flemington
stood
at
the
top
of
the
circular
staircase
below
it
balnillo
was
at
the
sending
everyone
within
reach
of
his
voice
in
search
of
her
sedan
chair
when
it
was
discovered
he
escorted
her
down
and
handed
her
into
it
then
according
to
the
custom
of
the
time
he
prepared
to
attend
its
progress
to
her
lodgings
in
hyndford
close
the
streets
were
even
dirtier
and
damper
than
before
but
he
was
as
anxious
to
walk
from
lady
anne
party
as
he
had
been
determined
to
be
carried
to
it
he
stepped
along
at
the
side
of
the
chair
turning
when
they
passed
a
light
to
see
the
dignified
silhouette
of
madam
flemington
head
as
it
appeared
in
shadow
against
the
farther
window
speech
was
impossible
as
they
went
for
avoidance
of
the
kennel
and
the
worse
obstacles
that
strewed
the
city
at
that
hour
before
the
scavengers
had
gone
their
rounds
kept
david
busy
the
only
profit
that
a
man
got
by
seeing
his
admired
one
home
in
edinburgh
in
was
the
honour
and
glory
of
it
when
she
emerged
from
the
chair
in
hyndford
close
he
insisted
upon
mounting
the
staircase
with
her
though
its
narrowness
compelled
them
to
go
in
single
file
and
when
they
stopped
halfway
up
at
the
door
in
the
towering
he
bade
her
and
descended
again
consoled
for
the
parting
by
her
permission
that
he
should
wait
upon
her
on
the
following
day
christian
was
admitted
and
sailed
into
her
little
room
a
light
was
in
it
and
archie
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
surprises
had
been
rolling
up
round
madam
flemington
all
the
evening
surprise
at
meeting
balnillo
surprise
at
his
attitude
and
this
crowning
surprise
of
all
she
was
bewildered
but
the
blessing
of
unexpected
relief
fell
on
her
she
went
towards
him
her
hands
outstretched
and
flemington
who
was
looking
at
her
with
a
wistfulness
she
had
never
seen
in
him
before
took
them
and
held
them
fast
oh
archie
she
exclaimed
she
could
say
no
more
they
sat
down
at
the
wide
hearth
together
the
shadow
of
the
great
carved
bed
sprawling
over
the
crowded
space
between
the
walls
and
over
christian
swelling
silks
then
he
told
her
the
history
of
the
time
since
they
parted
in
ardguys
garden
of
his
boarding
of
the
of
the
fight
with
the
rebels
at
inchbrayock
of
his
meeting
with
wattie
of
how
he
had
reached
aberbrothock
half
dead
and
had
lain
sick
for
two
days
in
an
obscure
tavern
by
the
shore
how
he
had
finally
sailed
for
leith
and
had
reached
edinburgh
christian
heard
him
her
gaze
fixed
upon
the
fire
she
had
elicited
nothing
about
james
logie
from
balnillo
and
there
was
no
word
of
him
in
archie
story
she
longed
to
speak
of
him
but
would
not
she
longed
to
know
if
the
beggar
had
told
the
truth
in
saying
that
the
two
men
had
actually
fought
but
she
asked
nothing
for
she
knew
that
her
wisest
part
was
to
accept
the
essentials
considering
them
as
the
whole
she
would
ask
no
questions
archie
had
come
back
she
had
forbidden
ardguys
to
him
and
he
had
evaded
her
ban
by
coming
here
yet
he
came
having
proved
himself
loyal
and
she
would
ignore
the
rest

herself

where
when
it
had
been
successful
a
few
maimed
and
haggard

stood
along
some
shieling
wall
in

of
a

of

all
down

retired

and
in
the

of
it
he
enjoyed
a
leisure
enlivened
by
women
and
dice
he
had
performed
his
task
of
stamping
out
the
danger
that
threatened
his
family
with
admirable
thoroughness
and
he
had
besides
the
comfortable
prospect
of
a
glorious
return
to

he
would
be
the
hero
of

a
rock
of
success
and
convivial
in
the
flood
of
tears
and
anguish
and
broken
aspiration
that
had
drowned
half
scotland
the
prince
had
begun
his
wanderings
in
the
west
hiding
among
the
hills
and
corries
of
the
islands
followed
by
a
few
faithful
souls
and
with
a
price
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
on
his
head
whilst

were
in

too
some
despairing
some
holding

to
the
forlorn
hope
of
raising
his
standard
anew
when
the
evil
day
should
be
over
among
these
last
was
james
logie
he
had
come
unhurt
through
the
battle
complete
indifference
about
personal
issues
had
wrapped
him
round
in
a
protecting
atmosphere
as
it
seems
to
enwrap
and
protect
the
unconcerned
among
men
he
had
left
the
field
in
company
with
the
prince
and
a
few
friends
with
whom
he
reached
the
ford
of
falie
on
the
nairn
river
they
had
held
a
rapid
council
at
this
place
prince
charles
desiring
that
the
remnant
of
his
army
should
rendezvous
at
ruthven
in
badenoch
whilst
he
made
his
way
to
france
for
his
hopes
were
living
still
and
he
still
looked
for
support
and
supplies
from
the
french
king
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
companions
at
the
ford
and
had
set
off
with
half
a
dozen
followers
for
the
coast
logie
turned
his
face
towards
angus
he
had
been
a
conspicuous
figure
in
the
prince
immediate
circle
and
he
knew
that
he
had
no
time
to
lose
if
he
was
to
cross
the
grampians
alive
he
thirsted
to
get
back
and
to
test
the
temper
of
the
east
coast
after
the
news
of
the
reverse
like
his
master
he
was
not
beaten
yet
he
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
ferrier
and
the
angus
men
for
he
had
been
on
the
prince
staff
but
the
friends
had
met
on
the
night
before
the
battle
and
it
was
a
compact
between
them
that
should
the
day
go
against
them
and
should
either
or
both
survive
the
fight
they
were
to
make
for
the
neighbourhood
of
forfar
where
they
would
be
ready
in
case
of
necessity
to
begin
on
their
task
of
raising
new
levies
for
the
cause
he
had
reached
the
spey
and
had
gained
deeside
in
safety
by
the
shores
of
the
avon
crossing
the
grampians
near
the
sources
of
the
isla
in
the
long
winter
that
had
passed
since
he
joined
the
prince
in
the
field
james
had
not
forgotten
flemington
his
own
labours
in
angus
and
at
the
taking
of
the
completely
as
they
had
filled
his
mind
in
the
autumn
had
sunk
back
into
the
limbo
of
insignificant
things
but
archie
was
often
in
his
thoughts
and
some
time
before
the
advance
on
inverness
he
had
heard
with
indescribable
feelings
that
he
was
intelligence
officer
to
the
duke
of
cumberland
the
terrible
thing
to
logie
was
that
archie
treachery
seemed
to
have
poisoned
the
sacred
places
in
his
own
past
when
he
turned
back
to
it
now
it
was
as
though
the
figure
of
the
young
man
stood
blocking
his
view
looking
at
him
with
those
eyes
that
were
so
like
the
eyes
of
diane
and
were
yet
the
eyes
of
a
traitor
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
that
october
morning
by
the
basin
of
montrose
perhaps
the
story
that
a
fatal
impulse
had
made
him
lay
bare
to
his
companion
had
been
tossed
about
a
subject
of
ridicule
on
flemington
lips
its
telling
but
one
more
proof
to
him
of
the
folly
of
men
he
could
scarcely
believe
that
archie
would
treat
the
record
of
his
anguish
in
such
a
way
but
then
neither
could
he
have
believed
that
the
sympathy
in
archie
face
the
break
in
his
voice
the
tension
of
his
listening
attitude
were
only
the
of
a
practised
spy
and
yet
this
horror
had
been
true
in
spite
of
the
unhealed
wound
that
he
carried
in
spite
of
the
batterings
of
his
years
logie
had
continued
to
love
life
but
now
he
had
begun
to
tell
himself
that
he
was
sick
of
it
and
for
another
very
practical
reason
his
generous
impulses
and
his
belief
in
flemington
had
undone
him
perhaps
if
the
young
painter
had
come
to
balnillo
announcing
an
ostentatious
adherence
to
the
stuarts
he
might
have
hesitated
before
taking
him
at
his
own
value
but
his
apparent
caution
and
his
unwillingness
to
speak
and
the
words
about
his
father
at
germain
which
he
had
let
fall
with
all
the
quiet
dignity
of
a
man
too
upright
to
pass
under
false
colours
had
done
more
to
put
the
brothers
on
the
wrong
track
than
the
most
violent
protestations
balnillo
had
been
careful
in
spite
of
his
confidence
in
his
guest
but
in
the
sympathy
of
his
soul
james
had
given
flemington
the
means
of
future
access
to
himself
now
the
tavern
in
the
castle
wynd
at
stirling
could
be
of
use
to
him
no
longer
and
he
knew
that
only
the
last
extremity
must
find
him
in
any
of
the
secret
haunts
known
to
him
in
the
muir
of
pert
madam
flemington
had
never
reopened
the
subject
of
james
logie
with
archie
in
her
wisdom
she
had
left
well
alone
installed
in
her
little
lodging
in
hyndford
close
with
her
woman
mysie
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
remain
where
she
was
there
was
much
to
keep
her
in
edinburgh
and
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
leave
the
centre
of
information
and
to
bury
herself
again
in
the
old
white
house
among
the
whilst
every
post
and
every
horseman
brought
word
of
some
new
turn
in
the
country
fortunes
news
of
the
highland
army
retreat
to
scotland
of
the
battle
of
falkirk
of
the
despatch
of
the
duke
of
cumberland
to
the
north
followed
one
another
as
the
year
went
by
and
still
she
stayed
on
with
her
emergence
from
the
seclusion
of
the
country
came
her
emergence
from
the
seclusion
she
had
made
for
herself
and
on
the
duke
thirty
hours
occupation
of
holyrood
she
threw
off
all
pretence
of
neutrality
and
repaired
with
other
whig
ladies
to
the
palace
to
pay
her
respects
to
the
stout
young
general
whose
unbeguiling
person
followed
so
awkwardly
upon
the
attractive
figure
of
his
predecessor
now
that
archie
was
restored
to
her
christian
found
herself
with
plenty
of
occupation
the
contempt
she
had
hitherto
professed
for
edinburgh
society
seemed
to
have
melted
away
and
every
every
assembly
and
rout
knew
her
chair
at
its
door
her
arresting
presence
in
its
midst
madam
flemington
name
was
on
a
good
many
tongues
that
winter
many
feared
her
some
maligned
her
but
no
one
overlooked
her
the
fact
that
she
was
the
widow
of
an
exiled
jacobite
lent
her
an
additional
interest
and
as
the
polite
world
set
itself
to
invent
a
motley
choice
of
reasons
for
her
adherence
to
the
house
of
hanover
which
it
discovered
before
her
reception
by
the
duke
at
holyrood
made
it
public
it
ended
by
stumbling
on
the
old
story
of
a
bygone
liaison
with
prince
charles
father
the
idea
was
so
much
to
its
taste
that
it
was
generally
accepted
and
christian
unknown
to
herself
became
the
and
alienated
mistress
of
that
prince
whom
her
party
had
begun
to
call
old
pretender
it
was
scarcely
a
legend
that
would
have
conciliated
her
had
it
come
to
her
ears
but
as
rumour
is
seldom
on
speaking
terms
with
its
victims
she
was
ignorant
of
the
interested
whispers
which
followed
her
through
the
wynds
and
up
the
staircases
of
the
old
town
but
the
reflected
halo
of
royalty
while
it
casts
deep
shadows
reaches
far
the
character
of
royal
light
of
love
stood
her
in
good
stead
even
among
those
to
whom
her
supposed
former
lover
was
an
abhorred
spectre
of
popery
and
political
danger
the
path
that
her
own
personality
would
surely
open
for
her
in
any
community
was
illumined
and
made
smooth
by
the
baleful
interest
that
hangs
about
all
kingly
irregularities
and
there
was
that
in
her
bearing
which
made
people
think
more
of
the
royal
and
less
of
the
irregular
part
of
the
business
also
among
the
whigs
she
was
a
brand
plucked
from
the
burning
one
who
had
turned
from
the
wrong
party
to
embrace
the
right
edinburgh
whig
at
heart
in
spite
of
its
backslidings
admired
madam
flemington
and
not
only
edinburgh
but
that
curious
fraction
of
it
david
balnillo
the
impression
that
christian
had
made
upon
the
judge
had
deepened
as
the
weeks
went
by
by
the
time
he
discovered
her
true
principles
and
realized
that
she
was
no
dupe
of
archie
but
his
partisan
he
had
advanced
so
far
in
his
acquaintance
with
her
had
become
so
much
her
servant
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
draw
back
she
had
dazzled
his
wits
and
played
on
his
vanity
and
that
vanity
was
not
only
warmed
and
cosseted
by
her
manner
to
him
not
only
was
he
delighted
with
herself
and
her
notice
but
he
had
begun
to
find
in
his
position
of
favoured
cavalier
to
one
of
the
most
prominent
figures
in
society
a
distinction
that
it
would
go
hard
with
him
to
miss
he
had
begun
their
conversation
at
lady
anne
maxwell
party
by
the
mention
of
archie
flemington
but
his
name
had
not
come
up
between
them
again
and
when
his
enlightenment
about
her
was
complete
and
the
talk
which
he
heard
in
every
house
that
he
frequented
revealed
her
in
her
real
colours
he
had
no
further
wish
to
discuss
the
man
into
whose
trap
he
had
fallen
david
balnillo
discoveries
were
extremely
unpalatable
to
him
if
christian
had
cherished
his
vanity
she
had
made
it
smart
too
no
man
least
of
all
one
like
the
judge
can
find
without
resentment
that
he
has
been
even
indirectly
the
dupe
of
a
person
to
whom
he
has
attached
himself
but
when
that
person
is
a
woman
determined
not
to
let
him
escape
from
her
influence
the
case
is
not
always
desperate
for
three
unblessed
days
it
was
wellnigh
desperate
with
balnillo
and
he
avoided
her
completely
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
summons
from
her
was
brought
to
him
that
his
inclination
for
her
company
and
the
chance
sight
of
lord
grange
holding
open
the
door
of
her
chair
forbade
him
to
disobey
she
had
worded
her
command
as
though
she
were
conferring
a
favour
nevertheless
after
an
hour
hesitation
david
had
taken
his
hat
and
repaired
to
hyndford
close
dragging
his
dignity
after
him
like
a
dog
on
a
leash
if
she
guessed
the
reason
of
his
absence
from
her
side
she
made
no
remark
receiving
him
as
if
she
had
just
parted
from
him
with
that
omission
of
greeting
which
implies
so
much
she
had
sent
for
him
she
said
because
her
man
of
business
had
given
her
a
legal
paper
that
she
would
not
sign
without
his
advice
she
looked
him
in
the
face
as
fearlessly
as
ever
and
her
glance
sparkled
with
its
wonted
fire
for
some
tormented
minutes
he
could
not
decide
whether
or
no
to
charge
her
with
knowledge
of
the
fraud
that
had
been
carried
on
under
his
roof
but
he
had
not
the
courage
to
do
so
also
he
was
acute
enough
to
see
that
she
might
well
reply
to
his
reproaches
by
reminding
him
that
he
had
only
himself
to
thank
for
their
acquaintance
she
had
not
made
the
advances
his
own
zeal
had
brought
about
their
situation
he
felt
like
a
fool
but
he
saw
that
in
speaking
he
might
look
like
one
which
some
consider
worse
he
left
her
assuring
himself
that
all
was
fair
in
love
and
politics
that
he
could
not
in
common
good
breeding
withhold
his
help
from
her
in
her
legal
difficulty
that
should
wind
of
archie
dealings
with
him
get
abroad
in
the
town
he
would
be
saving
appearances
in
avoiding
a
rupture
with
the
lady
whose
shadow
he
had
been
since
he
arrived
in
edinburgh
and
that
it
was
his
duty
as
a
of
prince
charles
to
keep
open
any
channel
that
might
yield
information
about
flemington
movements
whatsoever
may
have
been
the
quality
of
his
reasons
their
quantity
was
remarkable
he
did
not
like
the
little
voice
that
whispered
to
him
that
he
would
not
have
dared
to
offer
them
to
james
there
was
no
further
risk
of
a
meeting
with
archie
for
within
a
few
days
of
the
latter
appearance
in
hyndford
close
he
had
been
sent
to
the
border
with
instructions
to
watch
jedburgh
and
the
neighbourhood
of
liddesdale
through
which
the
prince
army
had
passed
on
its
march
to
england
madam
flemington
knew
that
the
coast
was
clear
and
david
had
no
suspicion
that
it
had
been
otherwise
very
few
people
in
edinburgh
were
aware
of
flemington
visit
to
it
it
was
an
event
of
which
even
the
caddies
were
ignorant
and
so
balnillo
lingered
on
putting
off
his
return
to
angus
from
week
to
week
his
velvet
began
to
show
signs
of
wear
and
was
replaced
by
a
suit
of
dark
purple
his
funds
were
dwindling
a
little
for
he
was
not
a
rich
man
and
a
new
set
of
verses
about
him
was
going
the
round
of
the
town
then
with
january
came
the
battle
of
falkirk
and
the
siege
of
stirling
castle
and
the
end
of
the
month
brought
cumberland
and
the
mustering
of
loyal
whigs
to
wait
upon
him
at
holyrood
palace
david
departed
quietly
he
had
come
to
edinburgh
to
avoid
playing
a
marked
part
in
angus
and
he
now
returned
to
angus
to
avoid
playing
a
marked
part
in
edinburgh
he
was
behaving
like
the
last
remaining
king
in
a
game
of
draughts
when
he
skips
from
square
to
square
in
the
safe
corner
of
the
board
but
he
did
not
know
that
government
had
kept
its
eye
on
all
his
doings
during
the
time
of
his
stay
perhaps
it
was
on
account
of
her
usefulness
in
this
and
in
other
delicate
matters
that
madam
flemington
augured
well
for
her
grandson
for
when
the
whig
army
crossed
the
forth
archie
went
with
it
as
intelligence
officer
to

the
parting
of
the
ways
july
spread
a
mantle
of
heather
over
the
grampians
in
glen
esk
the
rough
road
into
the
lowlands
little
better
than
a
ran
down
the
shore
of
loch
lee
to
come
out
at
last
into
the
large
spaces
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
the
greyness
of
the
summer
haze
lay
over
everything
and
the
short
grass
and
the
roots
of
and
thyme
smelt
warm
and
heady
for
the
wind
was
still
the
sun
seemed
to
have
sucked
up
some
of
the
out
of
the
earth
the
lower
atmosphere
was
suffused
with
a
dusty
lilac
where
high
overhead
it
softened
the
contours
of
the
scattered
rocks
amongst
carpets
of
rush
and
deep
moss
dappled
with
wet
patches
the
ruddy
stems
of
the
raised
slim
golden
heads
that
drooped
a
little
as
though
for
faintness
in
the
scented
warmth
an
occasional
passed
down
wind
purposeful
and
ostentatious
like
a
respectable
citizen
zealous
on
the
business
of
life
no
one
looking
along
the
windings
of
the
glen
and
drawing
in
the
ardent
quietness
of
the
summer
warmth
would
have
supposed
that
fire
and
sword
had
been
through
it
so
lately
its
vastness
of
outline
hid
the
ruined
huts
and
black
fragments
of
skeleton
that
had
smoked
up
into
the
mountain
stillness
homeless
women
and
children
had
fled
down
its
secret
tracks
hunted
men
had
given
up
their
souls
under
its
heights
the
rich
plainland
of
angus
had
sent
its
sons
to
fight
for
the
prince
in
the
north
and
of
those
who
survived
to
make
their
way
back
to
their
homes
many
had
been
overtaken
by
the
pursuit
that
had
swept
down
behind
them
through
the
hills
no
place
had
a
darker
record
than
glen
esk
archie
flemington
rode
down
the
glen
with
his
companion
some
little
way
in
front
of
the
corporal
and
the
three
men
who
followed
them
his
left
arm
was
in
a
sling
for
he
had
received
a
at
culloden
also
he
had
been
rolled
on
by
his
horse
which
was
killed
under
him
and
had
broken
a
rib
his
wound
though
not
serious
had
taken
a
long
time
to
heal
for
the
steel
had
cut
into
the
arm
bone
he
looked
thin
too
for
the
winter
had
been
a
time
of
strenuous
work
one
of
the
three
private
soldiers
the
last
of
the
small
string
of
horsemen
had
a
rope
knotted
into
his
reins
the
other
end
of
which
was
secured
round
the
middle
of
a
short
thickset
man
who
paced
sullenly
along
beside
the
horse
the
prisoner
arms
were
bound
at
his
back
his
reddish
beard
was
unkempt
and
his
clothes
ragged
he
made
a
sorry
figure
in
the
surrounding
beauty
nearly
two
months
had
gone
by
since
the
battle
of
culloden
and
the
search
for
fugitives
was
still
going
on
in
remote
places
cumberland
who
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
fort
augustus
for
edinburgh
on
his
way
to
london
had
given
orders
for
a
last
scouring
of
glen
esk
the
party
had
almost
reached
its
mouth
and
its
efforts
had
resulted
only
in
the
capture
of
this
one
rebel
but
as
there
was
some
slight
doubt
of
his
identity
and
as
the
officer
who
rode
beside
archie
was
one
whose
conscience
ranked
a
great
way
above
his
convenience
the
man
had
fared
better
than
many
of
those
taken
by
if
he
were
the
person
they
supposed
him
to
be
he
was
an
angus
farmer
distantly
related
to
david
ferrier
and
he
was
now
being
brought
to
his
own
country
for
identification
captain
callandar
the
officer
in
command
was
a
long
lean
bony
man
with
a
dark
face
a
silent
fellow
from
regiment
he
and
archie
had
met
very
little
before
they
started
south
together
and
they
had
scarcely
progressed
in
acquaintance
in
the
few
days
during
which
they
had
ridden
side
by
side
they
had
shared
their
food
on
the
bare
turf
by
day
lain
down
within
a
few
yards
of
each
other
at
night
they
had
gone
through
many
of
the
same
experiences
in
the
north
and
they
belonged
to
the
same
victorious
army
yet
they
knew
little
more
of
each
other
than
when
they
started
but
there
was
no
dislike
between
them
certainly
none
on
archie
side
and
if
the
other
was
a
little
critical
of
the
foreign
roll
of
his
he
did
not
show
it
archie
tongue
had
been
quiet
enough
he
was
riding
listlessly
along
and
though
he
looked
from
side
to
side
taking
in
the
details
of
what
he
saw
from
force
of
habit
they
seemed
to
give
him
no
interest
he
puzzled
callandar
a
good
deal
for
he
had
proved
to
be
totally
different
from
anything
that
he
had
expected
the
soldier
was
apt
to
study
his
when
not
entirely
swallowed
up
by
his
duty
and
he
had
been
rather
pleased
when
he
found
that
cumberland
brilliant
intelligence
officer
was
to
accompany
him
down
glen
esk
he
had
heard
much
about
him
archie
quick
answers
and
racy
talk
had
amused
the
duke
who
uncompanionable
himself
felt
the
awkward
man
amazement
at
the
readiness
of
others
and
scraps
of
flemington
sayings
had
gone
from
lip
to
lip
by
his
approval
callandar
was
taciturn
and
grave
but
he
was
not
stupid
and
he
had
begun
to
wonder
what
was
amiss
with
his
companion
he
decided
that
his
own
society
must
be
uncongenial
to
him
and
being
a
very
modest
man
he
did
not
marvel
at
it
but
the
sources
of
archie
discomfort
lay
far
far
deeper
than
any
passing
irritation
it
seemed
to
him
now
as
he
reached
the
mouth
of
the
glen
that
there
was
nothing
left
in
life
to
fear
because
the
worst
that
could
come
upon
him
was
looming
ahead
waiting
for
him
counting
his
horse
steps
as
he
left
the
hills
behind
an
apprehension
a
mere
suggestion
of
what
might
be
remotely
possible
a
skeleton
that
had
shown
its
face
to
him
in
sleepless
or
overwrought
moments
since
cumberland
victory
had
become
real
to
most
people
who
are
haunted
by
a
particular
dread
fate
plays
one
of
the
tricks
she
loves
so
much
she
is
an
expert
boxer
and
whilst
each
man
stands
up
to
her
in
his
long
defensive
fight
his
eye
upon
hers
guarding
himself
from
the
blow
he
expects
to
receive
in
the
face
she
hits
him
in
the
wind
and
he
finds
himself
knocked
out
but
she
had
dealt
otherwise
with
archie
for
a
week
ago
he
had
been
specially
detailed
to
proceed
to
angus
to
hunt
for
that
important
rebel
captain
james
logie
who
was
believed
to
have
made
his
way
southward
to
his
native
parts
at
fort
augustus
it
was
felt
that
flemington
was
exactly
the
right
man
to
be
entrusted
with
the
business
he
was
familiar
with
the
country
he
had
to
search
he
was
a
man
of
infinite
resource
and
infinite
intelligence
and
cumberland
meant
to
be
pleasant
in
his
harsh
ungraceful
manner
when
he
gave
him
his
commission
in
person
with
a
hint
that
he
expected
more
from
flemington
than
he
did
from
anybody
else
he
was
to
accompany
captain
callandar
and
his
three
men
the
officer
having
made
a
last
sweep
of
glen
esk
was
to
go
on
by
brechin
to
forfar
where
he
would
be
joined
by
another
and
larger
party
of
troops
that
was
on
its
way
down
glen
clova
from
braemar
for
cumberland
was
drafting
small
forces
into
angus
by
way
of
the
grampians
and
the
country
was
filling
with
them
he
had
dealt
drastically
with
montrose
the
rebellion
in
the
town
had
been
suppressed
and
the
neighbourhood
put
under
military
law
this
bit
of
the
east
coast
had
played
a
part
that
was
not
forgotten
by
the
little
german
general
and
he
was
determined
that
the
hornet
nest
he
had
smoked
out
should
not
whilst
james
logie
was
at
large
there
could
be
no
security
of
all
the
rebels
in
scotland
logie
was
the
man
whom
cumberland
was
most
desirous
to
get
the
great
nobles
who
had
taken
part
in
the
rising
were
large
quarry
indeed
but
this
commoner
who
had
worked
so
quietly
in
the
eastern
end
of
angus
who
had
been
on
the
staff
who
had
the
experience
of
many
campaigns
at
his
back
whose
ally
was
the
notorious
ferrier
who
had
seized
the
harbour
of
montrose
under
the
very
guns
of
a
government
sloop
of
war
was
as
dangerous
as
any
highland
chieftain
and
the
news
that
he
had
been
allowed
to
get
back
to
his
own
haunts
made
the
whig
generals
curse
though
he
might
be
quiet
for
the
moment
he
would
be
ready
to
stir
up
the
same
mischief
on
the
first
recrudescence
of
stuart
energy
it
was
not
known
what
had
happened
to
ferrier
for
although
he
was
a
marked
man
and
would
be
a
rich
haul
for
anybody
who
could
deliver
him
up
to
cumberland
he
was
considered
a
less
important
influence
than
james
and
government
had
scarcely
estimated
his
valuable
services
to
the
jacobites
which
were
every
whit
as
great
as
those
of
his
friend
lord
balnillo
was
a
puzzle
to
the
intelligence
department
his
name
had
gone
in
to
headquarters
as
that
of
a
strongly
suspected
rebel
he
was
james
brother
yet
while
archie
had
included
him
in
the
report
he
had
entrusted
to
the
beggar
he
had
been
able
to
say
little
that
was
definite
about
him
the
very
definite
information
he
had
given
about
james
and
ferrier
the
details
of
his
pursuit
of
the
two
men
and
his
warning
of
the
attack
on
the
had
mattered
more
to
the
authorities
than
the
politics
of
the
peaceable
old
judge
and
balnillo
subsequent
conduct
had
been
so
little
in
accordance
with
that
of
his
brother
that
he
was
felt
to
be
a
source
of
small
danger
he
had
been
no
great
power
on
the
bench
where
his
character
was
so
easy
that
prisoners
were
known
to
think
themselves
lucky
in
appearing
before
him
no
one
could
quite
account
for
his
success
in
the
law
and
the
mention
of
his
name
in
the
legal
circles
of
edinburgh
raised
nothing
worse
than
a
smile
he
had
taken
no
part
in
the
rejoicing
that
followed
james
feat
at
montrose
but
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
leaving
the
neighbourhood
and
during
his
long
stay
in
edinburgh
he
had
frequented
whig
houses
and
had
been
the
satellite
of
a
conspicuous
whig
lady
one
who
had
been
received
by
cumberland
with
some
distinction
the
grandmother
of
the
man
who
had
denounced
logie
the
authorities
decided
to
leave
him
alone
when
the
hills
were
behind
the
riders
and
the
levels
of
the
country
had
sunk
and
widened
out
on
either
hand
they
crossed
the
north
esk
which
made
a
shallow
curve
by
the
village
of
edzell
the
bank
rose
on
its
western
side
and
the
shade
of
the
trees
was
delightful
to
the
travellers
and
particularly
to
the
prisoner
they
carried
with
them
as
the
horses
snuffed
at
the
water
they
could
hardly
be
urged
through
it
and
callandar
and
archie
dismounted
on
the
farther
shore
and
sat
on
a
boulder
whilst
they
drank
they
watched
them
as
they
drew
the
draught
up
their
long
throats
and
raised
their
heads
when
satisfied
to
stare
with
dripping
muzzles
at
distant
nothings
after
the
fashion
of
their
kind
the
prisoner
aching
arms
were
unbound
that
he
might
drink
too
egad
i
have
pitied
that
poor
devil
these
last
miles
said
archie
as
the
man
knelt
at
the
brink
and
extended
his
stiffened
arms
into
a
pool
the
other
nodded
theoretically
he
pitied
him
but
a
rebel
was
a
rebel
you
have
no
bowels
of
compassion
they
are
not
in
your
instructions
callandar
they
should
be
served
out
like
ammunition
callandar
turned
his
grave
eyes
on
him
the
idea
displeases
you
said
archie
it
would
complicate
our
duty
he
spoke
like
a
humourless
man
but
one
side
of
his
mouth
twitched
downwards
a
little
and
flemington
who
had
the
eye
of
a
lynx
for
another
man
face
decided
that
the
mere
accident
of
habit
had
prevented
it
from
twitching
up
he
struck
him
as
the
most
repressed
person
he
had
ever
seen
there
would
not
be
enough
at
headquarters
to
go
round
observed
archie
callandar
mouth
straightened
and
like
the
horses
he
looked
at
nothing
criticism
was
another
thing
not
in
his
instructions
they
have
drunk
well
he
said
at
last
an
hour
will
bring
us
to
the
foot
of
huntly
hill
we
can
halt
and
feed
them
at
the
top
before
we
turn
off
towards
brechin
you
know
this
country
better
than
i
do
wait
a
little
said
archie
i
am
no
rebel
and
you
may
have
mercy
on
me
with
a
clear
conscience
he
had
slipped
his
arm
out
of
the
sling
and
was
resting
it
on
his
knee
you
are
in
pain
exclaimed
callandar
astonished
archie
laughed
why
man
do
you
think
i
ride
for
pleasure
with
the
top
half
of
a
bone
working
east
and
the
bottom
half
working
west
i
thought
began
callandar
you
thought
me
churlish
company
and
maybe
i
have
been
so
but
this
ride
has
been
no
holiday
for
me
i
did
not
mean
that
i
would
have
said
that
i
thought
your
wound
was
mended
my
is
mended
and
so
is
my
rib
said
flemington
but
there
are
two
handsome
splinters
hobnobbing
above
my
elbow
and
i
can
tell
you
that
they
dance
to
the
tune
of
my
horse
jog
callandar
opinion
of
him
rose
he
had
found
him
disappointing
as
a
companion
but
archie
had
hid
his
pain
and
he
understood
people
who
did
that
the
edzell
villagers
turned
out
to
stare
at
them
as
they
passed
a
short
time
later
when
they
took
the
road
again
after
the
riders
left
its
row
of
houses
their
way
ran
from
the
through
fields
that
had
begun
to
oust
the
moor
rising
to
the
crest
of
huntly
hill
on
the
farther
side
of
which
the
southern
part
of
angus
spread
its
partial
cultivation
down
to
the
basin
of
montrose
archie
discomfort
seemed
to
grow
he
shifted
his
sling
again
and
again
and
callandar
could
see
his
mouth
set
in
a
hard
line
now
and
then
an
impatient
sound
of
pain
broke
from
him
they
rode
on
silent
the
long
rise
of
the
hill
barring
their
road
like
a
wall
and
the
stems
of
the
that
crowned
it
beginning
to
turn
to
a
dusky
black
against
the
sky
which
was
cooling
off
for
evening
flemington
horse
was
a
slow
walker
and
he
had
begun
to
jog
persistently
his
rider
holding
him
back
had
fallen
behind
callandar
rode
on
preoccupied
and
when
roused
from
his
thoughts
he
turned
his
head
archie
waved
him
on
shouting
that
he
would
follow
more
slowly
for
the
troopers
moved
at
a
foot
pace
because
of
their
prisoner
and
he
stayed
abreast
of
them
as
callandar
passed
a
green
sea
of
invading
bracken
that
had
struggled
on
to
the
road
his
jaw
dropped
and
he
pulled
up
behind
the
feathering
waves
an
individual
was
sitting
in
a
wooden
box
on
wheels
and
four
dogs
harnessed
to
the
rude
vehicle
were
lying
on
the
ground
in
their
leathern
traces
he
noticed
with
astonishment
that
the
man
had
lost
the
lower
parts
of
his
legs
you
be
captain
callandar
said
wattie
his
twinkling
eyes
on
the
other
uniform
you
terrible
late
what
do
you
want
said
the
officer
amazed
the
beggar
peered
through
the
fern
and
saw
the
knot
of
riders
and
their
prisoner
coming
along
the
road
some
little
way
behind
whaur
yon
lad
flemington
he
demanded
what
do
you
want
exclaimed
callandar
again
if
you
are
a
beggar
you
have
chosen
a
strange
place
to
beg
in
for
answer
wattie
pulled
up
his
sliding
panel
and
took
out
two
sealed
letters
holding
them
low
in
the
shelter
of
the
fern
as
if
the
midges
dancing
their
evening
dance
above
the
should
not
look
upon
them
callandar
saw
that
one
of
the
letters
bore
his
own
name
whisht
said
the
beggar
thrusting
them
back
quickly
come
doon
here
an
hae
a
crack
wi
me
as
callandar
had
been
concerned
exclusively
with
troops
and
fighting
he
knew
little
about
the
channels
of
information
working
in
the
country
and
it
took
him
a
moment
to
explain
the
situation
to
himself
he
dismounted
under
the
fixed
glare
of
the
yellow
dog
he
was
a
man
to
whom
small
obstacles
were
invisible
when
he
had
a
purpose
and
he
almost
trod
on
the
animal
without
noticing
the
suppressed
hostility
gathering
about
his
heels
but
so
long
as
his
master
voice
was
friendly
the
cur
was
still
for
his
unwavering
mind
answered
to
its
every
tone
probably
no
spot
in
all
angus
contained
two
such
steadfast
living
creatures
as
did
this
green
place
by
the
bracken
when
callandar
and
the
yellow
dog
stood
side
by
side
the
soldier
tethered
his
horse
and
sat
down
on
the
moss
wattie
laid
the
letters
before
him
the
second
was
addressed
to
archie
callandar
broke
the
seal
of
the
first
and
read
it
slowly
through
then
he
sat
silent
examining
the
signature
which
was
the
same
that
flemington
had
showed
to
the
beggar
on
the
day
when
he
met
him
for
the
first
time
months
ago
by
the
mill
of
balnillo
he
was
directed
to
advance
no
farther
towards
brechin
but
to
keep
himself
out
of
sight
among
the
woods
round
huntly
hill
and
to
watch
the
muir
of
pert
for
it
was
known
that
the
rebel
james
logie
was
concealed
somewhere
between
brechin
and
the
river
he
was
not
upon
the
balnillo
estate
which
with
balnillo
house
had
been
searched
from
end
to
end
but
he
was
believed
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
muir
you
know
the
contents
of
this
asked
callandar
as
he
put
away
the
paper
inside
the
breast
of
his
coat
dod
a
ken
it
be
aboot
logie
he
a
fell
man
yon
have
ye
na
got
flemington
wi
ye
callandar
looked
upon
his
companion
with
disapproval
he
had
never
seen
him
never
heard
of
him
before
and
he
felt
his
manner
and
his
way
of
speaking
of
his
superiors
to
be
an
outrage
upon
discipline
and
order
which
were
two
things
very
near
his
heart
he
did
not
reply
whaur
flemington
demanded
the
beggar
again
you
make
very
free
with
flemington
name
tuts
exclaimed
wattie
ignoring
the
rebuke
a
got
ma
orders
the
same
as
yersel
an
a
to
gie
yon
thing
to
him
an
to
nae
ither
body
foo
will
a
dae
that
if
a
dinna
ken
whaur
he
is
his
argument
was
indisputable
flemington
will
be
with
me
in
a
moment
said
callandar
stiffly
he
is
following
the
sound
of
horses
feet
was
nearing
them
upon
the
road
and
callandar
rose
and
beckoned
to
archie
to
come
on
go
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
halt
until
i
join
you
he
told
the
corporal
as
the
men
passed
as
archie
dismounted
and
saw
who
was
behind
the
bracken
he
recoiled
it
was
to
him
as
if
all
that
he
most
loathed
in
the
past
came
to
meet
him
in
the
beggar
face
here
at
the
confines
of
the
lowland
country
the
same
hateful
influences
were
waiting
to
engulf
him
his
soul
was
weary
within
him
he
barely
replied
to
wattie
familiar
greeting
do
you
know
this
person
inquired
callandar
he
assented
ay
does
he
him
and
me
weel
acquaint
said
wattie
closing
an
eye
hae
tak
yon
he
held
out
the
letter
to
flemington
the
young
man
opened
it
slowly
turning
his
back
to
the
cart
and
his
brows
drew
together
as
he
read
his
destiny
did
not
mean
him
to
escape
logie
had
been
marked
down
and
the
circle
of
his
enemies
was
narrowing
round
him
flemington
was
to
go
no
farther
and
he
was
to
remain
with
callandar
to
await
another
message
that
would
be
brought
to
their
bivouac
on
huntly
hill
before
approaching
nearer
to
brechin
he
stood
aside
the
paper
in
his
hand
here
was
the
he
was
face
to
face
with
it
at
last
he
could
not
take
part
in
capture
on
that
he
was
completely
unalterably
determined
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
all
for
himself
he
could
not
think
nothing
was
clear
nothing
plain
but
the
settled
strength
of
his
determination
he
looked
into
the
mellowing
light
round
him
and
saw
everything
as
though
it
were
unreal
the
only
reality
was
that
he
had
chosen
his
way
heaven
was
pitiless
but
it
should
not
shake
him
far
above
him
a
solitary
bird
was
winging
its
way
into
the
spaces
beyond
the
hills
the
measured
beat
of
its
wings
growing
invisible
as
it
grew
smaller
and
smaller
and
was
finally
lost
to
sight
he
watched
it
fascinated
with
the
strange
detachment
of
those
whose
senses
and
consciousness
are
numbed
by
some
crisis
what
was
it
carrying
away
that
tiny
thing
that
was
being
swallowed
by
the
vastness
his
mind
could
only
grasp
the
idea
of
distance
of
space
callandar
was
at
his
elbow
and
his
voice
broke
on
him
as
the
voice
of
someone
awakening
him
from
sleep
these
are
my
orders
he
was
saying
as
he
held
out
his
own
letter
you
know
them
for
i
am
informed
here
that
they
are
the
duplicate
of
yours
there
was
no
escape
callandar
knew
the
exact
contents
of
both
papers
archie
might
have
kept
his
own
orders
to
himself
and
have
given
him
to
suppose
that
he
was
summoned
to
forfar
or
perth
and
must
leave
him
but
that
was
impossible
he
must
either
join
in
hunting
logie
or
leave
the
party
on
this
side
of
huntly
hill
we
had
better
get
on
said
callandar
they
mounted
and
as
they
did
so
wattie
also
got
under
way
his
team
was
now
reduced
to
four
for
the
terrier
which
had
formerly
run
alone
in
the
lead
had
died
about
the
new
year
he
took
up
his
switch
and
the
yellow
cur
and
his
companions
whirled
him
with
a
mighty
tug
on
to
the
road
he
had
been
waiting
for
some
time
in
the
bracken
for
the
expected
horseman
and
as
the
dogs
had
enjoyed
a
long
rest
they
followed
the
horses
at
a
steady
trot
callandar
and
flemington
trotted
too
and
the
cart
soon
fell
behind
beyond
the
crest
of
huntly
hill
the
muir
of
pert
sloped
eastwards
towards
the
coast
its
edges
resting
upon
the
esk
but
before
the
road
began
to
ascend
it
forked
in
two
one
part
running
upwards
and
the
other
breaking
away
west
towards
brechin
callandar
i
am
going
to
leave
you
said
archie
pulling
up
his
horse
to
leave
exclaimed
the
other
blankly
in
god
name
where
are
you
going
here
is
the
shortest
way
to
brechin
and
i
shall
take
it
i
must
find
a
surgeon
to
attend
to
this
arm
there
is
no
use
for
me
to
go
on
with
you
when
i
can
hardly
sit
in
my
saddle
for
pain
but
your
orders
gasped
callandar
i
will
make
that
right
you
must
go
on
alone
probably
i
shall
join
you
in
a
few
days
but
that
will
depend
on
what
instructions
i
get
later
if
you
hear
nothing
from
me
you
will
understand
that
i
am
busy
out
of
sight
my
hands
may
be
full
that
is
if
the
surgeon
leaves
me
with
both
of
them
callandar
he
turned
his
horse
and
left
him
the
other
opened
his
mouth
to
shout
after
him
ordering
him
to
come
back
but
remembered
that
he
had
no
authority
to
do
so
flemington
was
independent
of
him
he
belonged
to
a
different
branch
of
the
king
service
and
although
he
had
fought
at
culloden
he
was
under
different
orders
he
had
merely
accompanied
his
party
and
callandar
knew
very
well
that
though
his
junior
in
years
he
was
a
much
more
important
person
than
himself
the
nature
of
archie
duties
demanded
that
he
should
be
given
a
free
hand
in
his
movements
and
no
doubt
he
knew
what
he
was
about
but
had
he
been
callandar
subordinate
and
had
there
been
a
surgeon
round
the
nearest
corner
his
arm
might
have
dropped
from
his
shoulder
before
the
officer
would
have
permitted
him
to
fall
out
of
the
little
troop
callandar
had
never
in
all
his
service
seen
a
man
receive
definite
orders
only
to
disobey
them
openly
he
watched
him
go
petrified
his
brain
was
a
good
one
but
it
worked
slowly
and
archie
decision
and
departure
had
been
as
sudden
as
a
thunderbolt
also
there
was
contempt
in
his
heart
for
his
softness
and
he
was
sorry
archie
turned
round
and
saw
him
still
looking
after
him
he
sent
back
a
gibe
to
him
if
you
do
go
on
i
will
report
you
for
neglect
of
duty
he
shouted
laughing
chapter
xxi
huntly
hill
callandar
rode
up
huntly
hill
the
of
the
blossoming
briar
that
decks
all
angus
with
its
rubies
glowed
in
the
failing
sunlight
and
the
scent
of
its
leaf
came
in
puffs
from
the
wayside
ditches
the
blurred
heads
of
the
were
being
turned
into
clouds
of
gold
as
the
sun
grew
lower
and
the
road
climbed
higher
in
front
the
trees
began
to
mantle
huntly
hill
he
had
just
begun
the
ascent
at
a
foot
pace
when
he
heard
the
whirr
of
the
beggar
behind
him
then
at
his
side
and
he
turned
in
his
saddle
and
looked
down
on
his
pursuer
bald
crown
wattie
had
cast
off
his
bonnet
and
the
light
breeze
springing
up
lifted
the
fringe
of
his
grizzled
hair
whaur
awa
flemington
he
cried
as
he
came
up
the
other
answered
by
another
question
his
thoughts
had
come
back
to
the
prisoner
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
it
struck
him
that
the
man
in
the
cart
might
recognize
him
what
your
name
he
asked
abruptly
wattie
caird
you
belong
to
these
parts
he
nodded
then
come
on
i
have
not
done
with
you
yet
a
asking
ye
whaur
flemington
if
callandar
had
pleased
himself
he
would
have
driven
wattie
down
the
hill
at
the
point
of
the
sword
his
persistence
and
his
pestilent
unashamed
curiosity
were
so
distasteful
to
him
but
he
had
a
second
use
for
him
now
he
was
that
uncommon
thing
a
disciplinarian
with
tact
and
by
virtue
of
the
combination
in
himself
he
understood
that
the
troopers
in
front
of
him
who
had
been
looking
forward
eagerly
to
getting
their
heads
once
more
under
a
roof
that
night
would
be
disgusted
by
the
orders
he
was
bringing
he
had
noticed
the
chanter
sticking
out
from
under
wattie
leathern
bag
and
he
thought
that
a
stirring
tune
or
two
might
ease
matters
for
them
he
did
not
see
his
way
to
dispensing
with
him
at
present
so
he
tolerated
his
company
flemington
has
a
bad
wound
he
answered
he
has
gone
to
brechin
to
have
it
attended
to
whaur
did
he
get
it
at
culloden
moor
they
didna
tell
me
onything
aboot
that
who
tells
you
anything
about
flemington
what
do
you
know
about
him
heuch
exclaimed
wattie
with
contempt
it
mysel
that
should
tell
them
a
ken
mair
aboot
flemington
than
ony
ither
body
a

fine
what
brocht
yon
lad
here
he
seeking
logie
like
else
but
he
kens
fine
he
na
get
him
ay
does
he
callandar
looked
down
from
his
tall
horse
upon
the
grotesque
figure
so
close
to
the
ground
he
was
furious
at
the
creature
assumption
of
knowledge
you
are
a
piper
said
he
the
best
in
scotland
then
keep
your
breath
for
piping
and
let
other
people
business
be
he
said
sternly
man
dinna
fash
it
king
geordie
business
and
syne
it
mine
him
and
me
billies
ay
he
awa
is
he
flemington
callandar
quickened
his
horse
pace
he
was
not
going
to
endure
this
offensive
talk
but
wattie
urged
on
his
dogs
too
and
followed
hard
on
his
heels
all
through
the
winter
whilst
the
fortunes
of
scotland
were
deciding
themselves
in
the
north
he
had
been
idle
but
for
his
piping
and
singing
and
he
had
had
little
to
do
with
the
higher
matters
on
which
he
had
been
engaged
in
the
autumn
whilst
the
forces
of
the
coming
storm
were
seething
south
of
the
grampians
he
had
not
set
eyes
on
flemington
since
their
parting
by
the
farm
on
rossie
moor
but
many
a
night
lying
among
his
dogs
he
had
thought
of
archie
voice
calling
to
logie
as
he
tossed
and
babbled
in
his
broken
dreams
he
had
long
since
drawn
his
conclusion
and
made
up
his
mind
that
he
admired
archie
as
a
mighty
clever
fellow
but
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
more
astute
than
anybody
supposed
and
it
gave
him
great
delight
to
think
that
probably
no
one
but
himself
had
a
notion
of
the
part
flemington
was
playing
wattie
was
well
aware
of
his
advancement
for
his
name
was
in
everybody
mouth
he
knew
that
he
was
on
staff
just
as
logie
was
on
the
staff
of
the
prince
and
he
wagged
his
head
as
he
thought
how
archie
must
have
enriched
himself
at
the
expense
of
both
whig
and
jacobite
it
was
his
opinion
that
knowledge
being
marketable
it
was
time
that
somebody
else
should
enrich
himself
too
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
know
whether
flemington
as
a
man
had
continued
his
traffic
with
the
other
side
and
as
he
went
up
the
hill
beside
the
dark
whig
officer
he
was
turning
the
question
over
in
his
mind
he
had
kept
his
suspicions
jealously
to
himself
whilst
flemington
was
far
away
in
the
north
and
all
men
eyes
were
looking
across
the
grampians
he
knew
that
he
could
command
no
attention
and
he
had
cursed
because
he
believed
his
chance
of
profit
to
be
lost
archie
had
gone
out
of
range
and
he
could
not
reach
him
yet
he
kept
his
knowledge
close
like
a
prudent
man
in
case
the
time
should
come
when
he
might
use
it
and
now
flemington
had
returned
and
he
had
been
sent
out
to
meet
him
the
way
had
grown
steep
and
as
callandar
horse
began
to
stumble
the
soldier
swung
himself
off
the
tired
beast
and
walked
beside
him
his
hand
on
the
mane
wattie
was
considering
whether
he
should
speak
if
his
information
were
believed
it
would
be
especially
valuable
at
this
time
when
the
authorities
were
agog
to
catch
logie
and
the
reward
for
his
services
must
be
considerable
if
there
was
any
justice
in
the
world
they
would
never
catch
logie
because
flemington
was
in
league
with
him
wattie
knew
what
many
knew
that
the
rebel
was
believed
to
be
somewhere
about
the
great
muir
of
pert
now
just
in
front
of
them
but
so
far
as
he
could
make
out
the
only
person
who
was
aware
of
how
the
wind
set
with
archie
was
himself
what
he
had
seen
at
the
foot
of
huntly
hill
had
astonished
him
till
he
had
read
its
meaning
by
the
light
of
his
own
suspicions
though
he
had
not
been
close
enough
to
the
two
men
to
hear
exactly
what
passed
between
them
when
they
parted
he
had
seen
them
part
he
had
seen
callandar
standing
to
look
after
the
other
as
though
uncertain
how
to
act
and
he
had
heard
archie
derisive
shout
there
was
no
sign
of
a
quarrel
between
them
yet
callandar
face
suggested
they
had
disagreed
there
was
perplexity
in
it
and
underlying
disapproval
he
had
seen
his
gesture
of
astonishment
and
the
way
in
which
he
had
sat
looking
after
flemington
at
the
cross
roads
reining
back
his
horse
which
would
have
followed
its
companion
was
eloquent
to
the
beggar
callandar
had
not
expected
the
young
man
to
go
wattie
did
not
know
the
nature
of
the
orders
he
had
brought
but
he
knew
that
they
referred
to
logie
he
understood
that
those
who
received
them
were
hastening
to
meet
those
who
had
despatched
them
and
would
be
with
them
that
night
and
this
proved
to
him
how
important
it
was
that
the
letters
should
be
in
the
hand
of
the
riders
before
they
advanced
farther
on
their
way
he
had
been
directed
to
wait
on
the
northern
side
of
huntly
hill
and
had
been
specially
charged
to
deliver
them
before
callandar
crossed
it
he
told
himself
that
only
a
fool
would
fail
to
guess
that
they
referred
to
this
particular
place
but
the
illuminating
part
to
wattie
was
the
speech
he
had
heard
by
the
bracken
it
was
all
that
was
needed
to
explain
the
officer
stormy
looks
these
are
my
orders
callandar
had
said
but
you
know
them
for
i
am
informed
that
they
are
the
duplicate
of
yours
archie
had
disobeyed
them
and
wattie
was
sure
that
he
had
gone
because
the
risk
of
meeting
logie
was
too
great
to
be
run
now
was
the
time
for
him
to
speak
he
had
no
nicety
but
he
had
shrewdness
in
plenty
he
was
sudden
and
persistent
in
his
address
and
divining
the
obstacles
in
mind
he
charged
them
like
a
bull
flemington
na
let
ye
get
logie
said
he
he
made
his
announcement
with
so
much
emphasis
that
the
man
walking
beside
him
was
impressed
in
spite
of
his
prejudices
he
was
annoyed
too
he
turned
on
him
angrily
once
and
for
all
what
do
you
mean
by
this
infernal
talk
about
mr
flemington
he
cried
stopping
short
you
will
either
speak
out
or
i
will
take
it
upon
myself
to
make
you
i
have
three
men
in
the
wood
up
yonder
who
will
be
very
willing
to
help
me
i
believe
you
to
be
a
meddlesome
liar
and
if
i
find
that
i
am
right
you
shall
smart
for
it
but
the
beggar
needed
no
urging
and
he
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
callandar
it
no
me
that
sweer
to
speak
it

yet
the
officer
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
a
picture
of
perplexity

him

ke
he

near
it
that
an
nae
mair
callandar
began
to
think
back
he
had
not
heard
one
complaint
from
archie
since
the
day
they
rode
out
of
fort
augustus
together
and
he
remembered
his
own
astonishment
at
hearing
he
was
in
pain
from
his
wound
it
seemed
only
to
have
become
painful
in
the
last
couple
of
hours
it
is
easy
to
make
accusations
he
said
grimly
but
you

he
made
as
though
to
drive
on
callandar
stepped
in
front
of
the
dogs
and
stood
in
his
path
you
will
speak

chapter
xxii
huntly
hill
callandar
sat
a
little
apart
from
his
men
on
the
fringe
of
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
clearing
on
which
the
party
had
bivouacked
wattie
formed
the
centre
of
a
group
it
was
past
sunset
and
the
having
been
watered
and
fed
were
picketed
together
callandar
own
horse
snatched
at
the
straggling
behind
a
tree
the
officer
sat
on
a
log
his
chin
in
his
hand
pondering
on
the
amazing
story
that
the
beggar
had
divulged
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
to
make
of
it
but
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
inclined
to
believe
it
he
had
questioned
and
him
but
he
had
been
able
to
form
no
definite
opinion
wattie
had
described
his
meeting
with
archie
on
the
day
of
the
taking
of
the
ship
he
had
told
him
how
he
had
accompanied
him
on
his
way
how
he
had
been
forced
to
ask
shelter
for
him
at
the
farm
how
he
had
lain
and
listened
in
the
darkness
to
his
feverish
wanderings
and
his
appeals
to
logie
if
the
beggar
tale
had
been
true
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
intelligence
officer
whose
services
were
so
much
valued
by
cumberland
had
taken
money
from
the
rebels
though
it
seemed
that
he
had
hesitated
over
the
business
his
conscience
must
have
smitten
him
even
in
his
dreams
i
will
say
nothing
but
i
will
tell
you
all
he
had
cried
to
logie
i
shall
know
where
you
are
but
they
shall
never
know
in
his
delirium
he
had
taken
the
beggar
for
the
man
whose
he
was
proving
himself
to
be
and
when
consciousness
was
fighting
to
return
and
he
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
he
was
not
speaking
to
logie
it
was
his
companion
promise
to
deliver
a
message
of
reassurance
that
had
given
him
peace
and
sleep
tell
him
that
he
can
trust
me
he
had
said
what
puzzled
callandar
was
the
same
thing
that
had
puzzled
wattie
why
had
these
two
men
linked
together
by
a
hidden
understanding
fought
perhaps
flemington
had
repented
of
the
part
he
was
playing
and
had
tried
to
cut
himself
adrift
let
me
go
he
had
exclaimed
it
was
all
past
comprehension
at
one
moment
he
was
inclined
to
look
on
wattie
as
an
understudy
for
the
father
of
lies
at
another
he
asked
himself
how
he
could
have
had
courage
to
invent
such
a
calumny
how
he
had
dared
to
choose
a
man
for
his
victim
who
had
reached
the
position
that
archie
had
gained
but
he
realized
that
had
wattie
been
inventing
he
would
hardly
have
invented
the
idea
of
a
fight
between
flemington
and
captain
logie
that
little
incongruous
touch
seemed
to
reasonable
mind
to
support
the
truth
of
his
companion
tongue
and
then
there
was
flemington
sudden
departure
it
did
not
look
so
strange
since
he
had
heard
what
the
beggar
had
to
say
he
began
to
think
of
his
own
surprise
at
finding
archie
in
pain
from
a
wound
which
seemed
to
have
troubled
him
little
so
far
and
to
suspect
that
his
reliable
wits
had
been
stimulated
to
find
a
new
use
for
his
injured
arm
by
the
sight
of
huntly
hill
combined
with
the
news
in
his
pocket
his
gorge
rose
at
the
thought
that
he
had
been
riding
all
these
days
side
by
side
with
a
very
prince
among
traitors
his
face
hardened
his
own
duty
was
not
plain
to
him
and
that
perturbed
him
so
much
that
his
habitual
outward
gave
way
he
could
not
sit
still
while
he
was
driven
by
his
perplexities
he
sprang
up
walking
up
and
down
between
the
trees
ought
he
to
send
a
man
straight
off
to
brechin
with
a
summary
of
the
beggar
statement
he
could
not
vouch
for
the
truth
of
his
information
and
there
was
every
chance
of
it
being
disregarded
and
himself
marked
as
the
discoverer
of
a
mare
nest
there
was
scarcely
anything
more
repugnant
to
callandar
than
the
thought
of
himself
in
this
character
and
for
that
reason
if
for
no
other
he
inclined
to
the
risk
for
he
had
the
overwhelmingly
conscientious
man
instinct
for
martyrdom
his
mind
was
made
up
he
took
out
his
and
wrote
what
he
had
to
say
in
the
fewest
and
shortest
words
then
he
called
the
corporal
and
to
his
extreme
astonishment
ordered
him
to
ride
to
brechin
when
the
man
had
saddled
his
horse
he
gave
him
the
slip
of
paper
he
had
no
means
of
sealing
it
here
in
the
but
the
messenger
was
a
trusted
man
one
to
whom
he
would
have
committed
anything
with
absolute
conviction
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
to
lose
him
for
he
could
not
tell
how
long
he
might
be
kept
on
the
edge
of
the
muir
nor
how
much
country
he
would
have
to
search
with
his
tiny
force
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
he
trusted
that
the
corporal
would
be
sent
back
to
him
before
the
morrow
he
was
the
only
person
to
whom
he
could
give
the
open
letter
when
the
soldier
had
mounted
callandar
accompanied
him
to
the
confines
of
the
wood
giving
him
instructions
from
the
map
he
carried
wattie
sat
on
the
ground
beside
his
cart
his
back
was
against
a
little
raised
bank
where
his
feet
should
have
been
the
yellow
dog
was
stretched
asleep
as
callandar
and
his
corporal
disappeared
among
the
trees
he
began
to
sing
tod
in
his
rich
voice
throwing
an
atmosphere
of
dramatic
slyness
into
the
words
that
made
his
hearers
shout
with
delight
at
the
end
of
each
verse
when
he
had
finished
the
song
he
was
barely
suffered
to
take
breath
before
being
compelled
to
begin
again
even
the
prisoner
who
lay
resting
still
bound
within
sight
of
the
soldiers
listened
laughing
into
his
red
beard
but
suddenly
he
stopped
rising
to
his
feet
a
deevil
wi
his
hand
upon
the
gate
an
aye
the
guidwife
cries
to
him
wattie
voice
fell
cutting
the
line
short
for
a
rush
of
steps
was
bursting
through
the
trees
was
close
on
them
dulled
by
the
underfoot
sweeping
over
the
stumps
and
the
naked
roots
the
beggar
stared
clutching
at
the
bank
his
three
companions
sprang
up
the
wood
rang
with
shots
and
one
of
the
soldiers
rolled
over
on
his
face
gasping
as
he
tried
to
rise
struggling
and
snatching
at
the
ground
with
convulsed
fingers
the
remaining
two
ran
one
towards
the
prisoner
and
one
towards
the
horses
which
were
plunging
against
each
other
in
terror
the
latter
man
dropped
midway
with
a
bullet
through
his
head
the
swiftness
of
the
misfortune
struck
panic
into
wattie
as
he
sat
alone
helpless
incapable
either
of
flight
or
of
resistance
one
of
his
dogs
was
caught
by
the
leaden
hail
and
lay
fighting
its
life
out
a
couple
of
paces
from
where
he
was
left
a
defenceless
thing
in
this
sudden
storm
of
death
two
of
the
remaining
three
went
rushing
through
the
trees
yelping
as
the
stampeding
horses
added
their
share
to
the
danger
and
riot
these
had
torn
up
their
which
wrenched
easily
from
a
resistance
made
for
the
most
part
of
moss
and
swung
and
whipped
at
the
ends
of
the
flying
ropes
behind
the
crazy
animals
as
they
dashed
about
the
surviving
trooper
had
contrived
to
catch
his
own
horse
and
was
riding
for
his
life
towards
the
road
by
which
they
had
come
from
edzell
the
only
quiet
thing
besides
the
beggar
was
the
yellow
cur
who
stood
at
his
master
side
stiff
and
stubborn
and
ugly
the
coarse
hair
rising
on
his
back
wattie
panic
grew
as
the
drumming
of
hoofs
increased
and
the
horses
dashed
hither
and
thither
he
was
more
afraid
of
them
than
of
the
ragged
enemy
that
had
descended
on
the
wood
the
dead
troopers
lay
huddled
one
on
his
face
and
the
other
on
his
side
the
wounded
last
struggles
had
ceased
half
a
dozen
men
were
pursuing
the
horses
with
outstretched
arms
and
callandar
charger
had
broken
loose
with
its
comrades
and
was
thundering
this
way
and
that
snorting
and
leaping
with
cocked
ears
and
flying
mane
the
beggar
watched
them
with
a
horror
which
his
dislike
and
fear
of
horses
made
agonizing
the
menace
of
these
irresponsible
creatures
mad
with
excitement
and
terror
so
heavy
so
colossal
when
seen
from
his
own
helpless
nearness
to
the
earth
that
was
shaking
under
their
tread
paralyzed
him
his
impotence
enwrapped
him
tragic
horrible
a
nightmare
woven
of
death
terrors
he
could
not
escape
there
was
no
shelter
from
the
thrashing
hoofs
the
gleaming
iron
of
the
shoes
the
cumbrous
perspective
of
the
great
animals
blocked
out
the
sky
with
its
bulk
as
their
rocking
bodies
went
by
plunging
slipping
recovering
themselves
within
the
cramped
circle
of
the
open
space
he
knew
nothing
of
what
was
happening
nor
did
he
see
that
the
prisoner
stood
freed
from
his
bonds
he
knew
james
logie
by
sight
and
he
knew
ferrier
but
though
both
were
standing
by
the
man
he
recognized
neither
he
had
just
enough
wits
left
to
understand
that
callandar
bivouac
had
been
attacked
but
he
recked
of
nothing
but
the
thundering
horses
that
were
being
chased
to
and
fro
as
the
circle
of
men
closed
in
he
felt
sick
as
it
narrowed
and
he
could
only
flatten
himself
stupefied
against
the
bank
the
last
thing
he
saw
was
the
yellow
coat
of
his
dog
as
the
beast
cowered
and
snapped
keeping
his
post
with
desperate
tenacity
in
the
din
the
bank
against
which
he
crouched
cut
the
clearing
diagonally
and
as
the
men
pressed
in
nearer
round
the
horses
callandar
charger
broke
out
of
the
circle
followed
by
the
two
others
a
cry
from
the
direction
in
which
they
galloped
and
the
sound
of
frantic
nearing
hoofs
told
that
they
had
been
headed
back
once
more
the
bank
was
high
enough
to
hide
wattie
from
them
as
they
returned
but
he
could
feel
the
earth
shake
with
their
approach
which
rang
in
his
ears
like
the
roar
of
some
dread
implacable
fate
he
could
see
nothing
now
as
he
lay
with
fear
but
he
was
aware
that
his
dog
had
leaped
upon
the
bank
behind
him
and
he
heard
the
voice
hoarse
and
brutal
with
defiant
agony
just
above
his
head
all
the
qualities
that
have
gone
to
make
the
dog
the
outcast
of
the
east
seemed
to
show
in
the
cur
attitude
as
he
raised
himself
an
insignificant
common
beast
in
the
path
of
the
great
noble
stampeding
creatures
it
was
the
curse
of
his
curship
that
in
this
moment
of
his
life
when
he
hurled
all
that
was
his
in
the
world
his
body
against
the
danger
that
swooped
on
his
master
he
should
take
on
no
nobility
of
aspect
nothing
to
picture
forth
the
heart
that
smote
against
his
panting
ribs
another
moment
and
the
charger
had
leaped
at
the
bank
just
above
the
spot
where
skirling
wattie
grizzled
head
lay
against
the
sod
the
cur
sprang
up
against
the
overwhelming
bulk
the
smiting
hoofs
the
whirl
of
and
struck
in
by
the
horse
knee
was
sent
rolling
down
the
slope
as
he
fell
there
was
a
thud
of
dislodged
earth
and
the
charger
startled
by
the
sudden
apparition
of
the
prostrate
figure
below
him
slipped
on
the
bank
stumbled
sprang
and
checked
by
the
flying
rope
crashed
forward
burying
the
beggar
under
his
weight
james
and
ferrier
ran
forward
as
the
animal
struggled
to
its
feet
unhurt
it
tore
past
the
men
who
had
broken
their
line
as
they
watched
the
fall
the
three
horses
made
off
between
the
trees
and
logie
approached
the
beggar
he
lay
crushed
and
mangled
as
quiet
as
the
dead
troopers
on
the
ground
there
was
no
mistaking
wattie
rigid
stillness
and
as
james
and
ferrier
with
the
man
approached
him
they
knew
that
he
would
never
rise
to
blow
his
pipes
nor
to
fill
the
air
with
his
voice
again
the
yellow
dog
was
stretched
panting
a
couple
of
paces
from
the
grotesque
body
which
had
now
for
the
first
time
taken
on
dignity
as
logie
bent
to
examine
him
and
would
have
lifted
him
the
cur
dragged
himself
up
one
of
his
was
broken
but
he
crawled
snarling
to
the
beggar
side
and
turned
his
maimed
body
to
face
the
men
who
should
dare
to
lay
a
hand
on
wattie
the
drops
poured
from
his
hanging
tongue
and
his
eye
was
alight
with
the
dull
flame
of
pain
he
would
have
torn
logie
to
bits
if
he
could
as
he
trailed
himself
up
to
shelter
the
dead
man
from
his
touch
he
made
a
great
effort
to
get
upon
his
legs
and
his
jaws
closed
within
an
inch
of
james
arm
one
of
the
men
drew
the
pistol
from
his
belt
ay
shoot
the
brute
said
another
james
held
up
his
hand
the
man
is
dead
said
he
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
his
comrades
and
you
would
be
the
same
if
yon
dog
could
reach
you
rejoined
ferrier
let
me
shoot
him
he
will
only
die
lying
here
let
him
be
his
leg
is
broken
that
is
all
the
cur
made
another
attempt
to
get
his
teeth
into
logie
and
almost
succeeded
ferrier
raised
his
pistol
again
but
james
thrust
it
back
the
world
needs
a
few
such
creatures
as
that
in
it
said
he
lord
ferrier
what
a
heart
there
is
in
the
poor
brute
stand
away
from
him
logie
he
is
half
mad
we
must
get
away
from
this
place
said
james
unheeding
or
that
man
who
has
ridden
away
will
bring
the
whole
country
about
our
ears
it
has
been
a
narrow
escape
for
you
gourlay
he
said
to
the
released
prisoner
we
must
leave
the
old
vagabond
lying
where
he
is
there
is
no
burying
him
with
that
devil
left
alive
cried
ferrier
i
promise
you
i
will
not
venture
to
touch
him
my
poor
fellow
said
james
turning
to
the
dog
it
is
of
no
use
you
can
not
save
him
god
help
you
for
the
truest
friend
that
a
man
ever
had
he
pulled
off
his
coat
and
approached
him
the
men
stood
round
looking
on
in
amazement
as
he
flung
it
over
the
yellow
body
the
dog
yelled
as
logie
grasped
and
lifted
him
holding
him
fast
in
his
arms
but
his
jaws
were
muffled
in
the
coat
and
the
pain
of
the
broken
limb
was
weakening
his
struggles
ferrier
looked
on
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
he
admired
the
dog
but
did
not
always
understand
james
you
are
going
to
hamper
yourself
with
him
now
he
exclaimed
give
me
the
piper
bonnet
said
the
other
there
push
it
into
the
crook
of
my
arm
between
the
poor
brute
and
me
it
will
make
him
go
the
easier
you
will
need
to
scatter
now
leave
the
piper
where
he
is
a
few
inches
of
earth
will
do
him
no
good
ferrier
i
am
going
you
and
i
will
have
to
lie
low
for
awhile
after
this
the
cur
had
grown
exhausted
and
ceased
to
fight
he
shivered
and
snuffled
feebly
at
the
kilmarnock
bonnet
the
knob
of
which
made
a
red
spot
against
the
shirt
on
james
broad
breast
ferrier
and
gourlay
glanced
after
him
as
he
went
off
between
the
trees
but
as
they
had
no
time
to
waste
on
the
sight
of
his
eccentricities
they
disappeared
in
different
directions
dusk
was
beginning
to
fall
on
the
wood
and
on
the
dead
beggar
as
he
lay
with
his
two
silent
comrades
looking
towards
the
grampians
from
the
top
of
huntly
hill
chapter
xxiii
the
muir
of
pert
callandar
watched
his
corporal
riding
away
from
the
confines
of
the
wood
his
eyes
followed
the
horse
as
it
disappeared
into
hollows
and
threaded
its
way
among
lumps
of
rock
he
stood
for
some
time
looking
out
over
the
landscape
now
growing
cold
with
the
loss
of
the
sun
his
mind
full
of
flemington
then
he
turned
back
with
a
sigh
to
retrace
his
way
his
original
intention
in
bringing
wattie
up
the
hill
came
back
to
him
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
yet
to
discover
whether
he
could
identify
the
man
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
fusillade
from
his
burst
upon
him
he
stopped
listening
then
ran
forward
into
the
wood
the
map
from
which
he
had
been
directing
the
corporal
clutched
in
his
hand
he
had
gone
some
distance
with
the
soldier
so
he
only
reached
the
place
when
the
quick
disaster
was
over
to
hear
the
of
the
escaping
horses
dying
out
as
they
galloped
down
huntly
hill
the
smoke
of
the
firearms
hung
below
the
branches
like
a
grey
canopy
giving
the
unreality
of
a
vision
to
the
spectacle
before
him
he
could
not
see
the
beggar
body
but
the
overturned
cart
was
in
full
view
a
ridiculous
object
with
its
wooden
wheels
raised
as
though
in
protest
to
the
sky
he
looked
in
vain
for
a
sign
of
his
third
man
and
at
the
sight
of
the
uniform
upon
the
two
dead
figures
lying
on
the
ground
he
understood
that
he
was
alone
of
the
three
private
soldiers
who
had
followed
him
down
glen
esk
there
was
not
one
left
with
him
archie
the
traitor
was
gone
and
only
the
man
remained
he
could
see
him
in
the
group
that
was
watching
james
logie
as
he
captured
the
struggling
dog
callandar
ground
his
teeth
then
he
dropped
on
one
knee
and
contemplated
the
sight
from
behind
the
great
circle
of
roots
and
earth
that
a
fallen
tree
had
torn
from
the
sod
of
all
men
living
he
was
one
of
the
last
who
might
be
called
a
coward
but
neither
was
he
one
of
those
who
will
plunge
to
their
own
undoing
and
to
that
of
other
people
into
needless
disaster
he
would
have
gone
grimly
into
the
hornet
nest
before
him
pistol
in
hand
leaving
heaven
to
take
care
of
the
result
had
the
smallest
advantage
to
his
king
and
country
been
attainable
thereby
his
own
death
or
capture
would
do
no
more
than
prevent
him
from
carrying
news
of
what
had
happened
to
headquarters
and
he
decided
with
the
promptness
hidden
behind
his
taciturn
demeanour
that
his
nearest
duty
was
to
identify
james
logie
if
he
were
present
callandar
duty
was
the
only
thing
that
he
always
saw
quickly
from
his
shelter
he
marked
the
two
jacobite
officers
and
as
he
knew
ferrier
very
well
from
description
he
soon
made
out
the
man
he
wanted
james
was
changed
since
the
time
when
he
had
first
come
across
archie
path
his
clothes
were
worn
and
stained
and
the
life
of
wandering
and
concealment
that
he
had
led
since
he
parted
from
the
prince
had
set
its
mark
on
him
he
had
slept
in
as
many
strange
places
of
late
as
had
the
dead
beggar
at
his
feet
anxious
watching
and
lack
of
food
and
rest
were
levelling
the
outward
man
to
something
more
primitive
and
haggard
than
the
gentleman
of
the
days
before
culloden
yet
there
remained
to
him
the
atmosphere
that
could
never
be
obliterated
the
personality
that
he
could
never
lose
until
the
earth
should
lie
on
him
he
was
no
better
clothed
than
those
who
surrounded
him
but
his
was
plain
the
watcher
devoured
him
with
his
eyes
as
he
turned
from
his
comrades
carrying
the
dog
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
the
rebels
scattered
quietly
and
callandar
crouched
lower
praying
fortune
to
prevent
anyone
from
passing
his
retreat
none
approached
him
and
he
was
left
with
the
three
dead
men
in
possession
of
the
wood
he
rose
and
looked
at
his
silent
comrades
it
would
be
useless
to
follow
logie
because
with
so
many
of
his
companions
dispersing
at
this
moment
about
the
fringes
of
the
muir
of
pert
he
could
hardly
hope
to
do
so
unobserved
there
would
be
no
chance
of
getting
to
close
quarters
with
him
which
was
callandar
chief
desire
for
the
mere
suspicion
of
a
hostile
presence
would
only
make
james
shift
his
before
the
gathering
troops
could
draw
their
cordon
round
him
he
abandoned
the
idea
with
regret
telling
himself
that
he
must
make
a
great
effort
to
get
to
brechin
and
to
return
with
a
mounted
force
in
time
to
take
action
in
the
morning
the
success
of
his
ambush
and
his
ignorance
that
he
had
been
watched
would
keep
logie
quiet
for
the
night
he
decided
to
take
the
only
road
that
he
knew
the
one
by
which
flemington
had
left
him
the
upper
one
entangled
itself
in
the
muir
and
might
lead
him
into
some
conclave
of
the
enemy
he
began
to
descend
in
the
shadows
of
the
coming
darkness
that
was
drawing
itself
like
an
insidious
net
over
the
spacious
land
he
had
almost
reached
the
road
when
a
moving
object
not
far
from
him
made
him
stop
a
man
was
hurrying
up
the
hill
some
little
way
to
his
right
treading
swiftly
along
and
though
his
head
was
turned
from
callandar
and
he
was
not
near
enough
for
him
to
distinguish
his
features
the
sling
across
his
shoulder
told
him
that
it
was
flemington
callandar
stood
still
staring
after
him
archie
boldness
took
away
his
breath
here
he
was
returning
on
his
tracks
and
if
he
kept
his
direction
he
would
have
to
pass
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
spot
on
which
he
knew
that
the
companions
he
had
left
would
be
halted
callandar
had
pointed
out
the
place
to
him
as
they
approached
the
hill
together
archie
took
a
wider
sweep
as
he
neared
the
wood
and
the
soldier
standing
in
the
shadow
of
a
whose
berries
were
already
beginning
to
colour
for
autumn
saw
that
he
was
making
for
the
muir
and
knew
that
the
beggar
was
justified
one
thing
only
could
be
bringing
him
back
he
had
come
as
wattie
had
predicted
to
warn
logie
he
had
spoken
wisdom
that
dead
vagabond
lying
silent
for
ever
among
the
trees
he
had
assured
him
that
flemington
would
not
suffer
him
to
take
logie
he
knew
him
and
he
had
laughed
at
the
idea
of
his
wounded
arm
turning
him
out
of
his
road
it
no
the
like
o
that
that
gars
the
like
o
him
greet
he
had
said
and
he
was
right
callandar
watching
the
definite
course
of
the
figure
through
the
dusk
was
sure
that
he
was
taking
the
simplest
line
to
a
retreat
whose
exact
position
he
knew
he
turned
and
followed
running
from
cover
to
cover
his
former
errand
abandoned
it
was
strange
that
in
spite
of
all
a
vague
gladness
was
in
his
heart
as
he
thought
that
archie
was
not
the
soft
creature
that
he
had
pretended
to
be
there
were
generous
things
in
callandar
then
his
generous
impulse
turned
back
on
him
in
bitterness
for
it
occurred
to
him
that
archie
had
been
aware
of
what
lay
waiting
for
them
and
had
saved
himself
from
possible
accident
in
time
they
went
on
till
they
reached
the
border
of
the
muir
flemington
going
as
unconcernedly
as
if
he
were
walking
in
the
streets
of
brechin
though
he
kept
wide
of
the
spot
on
which
he
believed
the
riders
to
have
disposed
themselves
for
the
night
there
was
no
one
who
knew
him
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
he
wore
no
uniform
to
make
him
conspicuous
in
the
eyes
of
any
chance
passer
in
this
lonely
neighbourhood
as
callandar
emerged
from
the
straggling
growth
at
the
muir
edge
he
saw
him
still
in
front
going
through
the
deep
thickness
of
the
heather
callandar
wished
that
he
knew
how
far
the
muir
extended
and
exactly
what
lay
on
its
farther
side
his
map
was
thrust
into
his
coat
but
it
was
now
far
too
dark
for
him
to
make
use
of
it
the
tall
figure
was
only
just
visible
and
he
redoubled
his
pace
gaining
a
little
on
it
a
small
stationary
light
shone
ahead
evidently
the
window
of
some
muirland
hovel
there
is
nothing
so
difficult
to
decide
as
the
distance
of
a
light
at
night
but
he
guessed
that
it
was
the
goal
towards
which
archie
was
leading
he
went
forward
till
the
young
man
voice
hailing
someone
and
the
sound
of
knocking
made
him
stop
and
throw
himself
down
in
the
heather
he
thought
he
heard
a
door
shut
when
all
had
been
quiet
for
a
minute
he
rose
up
and
approaching
the
house
took
up
his
stand
not
a
dozen
yards
from
the
walls
perplexity
came
on
him
he
had
been
surprisingly
successful
in
pursuing
flemington
unnoticed
as
far
as
this
hovel
but
he
had
yet
to
find
out
who
was
inside
it
perhaps
the
person
he
had
heard
speaking
was
logie
but
equally
perhaps
not
there
was
no
sound
of
voices
within
though
he
heard
movements
he
dared
not
approach
the
uncurtained
window
to
look
in
for
the
person
whose
step
he
heard
was
evidently
standing
close
to
it
he
would
wait
listening
for
that
person
to
move
away
and
then
would
try
his
luck
he
had
spent
perhaps
ten
minutes
thus
occupied
when
without
a
warning
sound
the
door
opened
and
archie
stood
on
the
threshold
as
still
as
though
he
were
made
of
marble
it
was
too
dark
for
either
man
to
see
more
than
the
other
blurred
outline
flemington
looked
out
into
the
night
come
in
callandar
he
called
you
are
the
very
man
i
want
the
soldier
astonishment
was
such
that
his
feet
seemed
frozen
to
the
ground
he
did
not
stir
come
cried
archie
you
have
followed
me
so
far
that
you
surely
will
not
turn
back
at
the
last
step
i
need
you
urgently
man
come
in
he
held
the
door
open
callandar
entered
pushing
past
him
and
found
himself
in
a
low
small
room
wretchedly
furnished
with
another
at
the
back
opening
out
of
it
both
were
empty
and
the
light
he
had
seen
was
standing
on
the
table
there
is
no
one
here
he
exclaimed
no
said
flemington
where
is
the
man
you
were
speaking
to
he
is
gone
the
rogue
would
not
wait
to
receive
you
it
was
that
rebel
it
was
captain
logie
cried
callandar
it
was
not
logie
you
may
take
my
word
for
that
replied
archie
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
crossed
his
legs
try
again
callandar
he
said
lightly
callandar
lips
were
drawn
into
an
even
line
but
they
were
shaking
the
mortification
of
finding
that
archie
had
been
aware
of
his
presence
had
pursued
his
way
unconcerned
knowing
that
he
followed
had
called
him
in
as
a
man
calls
the
he
has
left
outside
was
hot
in
him
no
wonder
his
own
concealment
had
seemed
so
easy
you
have
sent
him
to
warn
logie
that
is
what
you
have
done
he
cried
you
are
a
scoundrel
i
know
that
he
stepped
up
to
him
and
would
have
laid
hold
of
his
collar
but
the
sling
stopped
him
i
have
callandar
you
are
a
genius
as
the
other
stood
before
him
speechless
flemington
rose
up
you
have
got
to
arrest
me
he
said
that
is
why
i
called
you
in
i
might
have
run
out
by
the
back
of
the
house
like
the
man
who
is
gone
who
went
with
my
message
almost
before
the
door
was
shut
look
i
have
only
one
serviceable
arm
and
no
sword
i
left
it
where
i
left
my
horse
and
here
is
my
pistol
i
will
lay
it
on
the
table
so
you
will
have
no
trouble
in
taking
me
prisoner
you
have
not
had
your
stalking
for
nothing
after
all
you
mighty
hunter
before
the
lord
you
mean
to
give
yourself
up
you
who
have
taken
so
much
care
to
save
yourself
i
have
meant
to
ever
since
i
saw
you
under
the
watching
me
flattened
against
the
trunk
like
a
squirrel
i
would
as
soon
be
your
prisoner
as
anyone
else
sooner
i
think
i
can
not
understand
you
exclaimed
callandar
taking
possession
of
the
weapon
archie
had
laid
down
it
is
hard
enough
to
understand
oneself
but
i
do
at
last
said
the
other
once
i
thought
life
easy
but
mine
has
been
mighty
difficult
lately
from
here
on
it
will
be
quite
simple
and
there
will
not
be
much
more
of
it
i
fancy
you
are
right
there
said
callandar
grimly
i
can
see
straight
before
me
now
i
tell
you
life
has
grown
simple
you
lied
at
the
cross
roads
i
did
how
you
looked
after
me
as
i
went
well
i
have
done
what
i
suppose
no
one
has
ever
done
before
i
have
threatened
to
report
you
for
neglecting
your
duty
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
and
i
am
obliged
to
tell
you
to
arrest
me
now
o
callandar
who
will
correct
your
backslidings
when
there
is
an
end
of
me
the
other
did
not
smile
as
he
looked
at
flemington
laughing
eyes
soft
and
sparkling
under
the
downward
curve
of
his
brows
through
his
anger
the
pity
of
it
all
was
smiting
him
though
he
was
so
little
given
to
sentiment
perhaps
archie
charm
had
told
on
him
all
the
time
they
had
been
together
though
he
had
never
decided
whether
he
liked
him
or
not
and
he
looked
so
young
when
he
laughed
what
have
you
done
he
cried
pacing
suddenly
up
and
down
the
little
room
you
have
run
on
destruction
flemington
you
have
thrown
your
life
away
why
have
you
done
this
you
if
a
thing
is
worthless
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
throw
it
away
callandar
watched
him
with
pain
in
his
eyes
what
made
you
suspect
me
asked
archie
you
can
tell
me
anything
now
there
is
only
one
end
to
this
business
it
will
be
the
making
of
you
pshaw
exclaimed
the
other
turning
away
why
did
you
follow
me
continued
archie
callandar
was
silent
tell
me
this
he
said
at
last
what
makes
you
give
yourself
up
now
without
a
struggle
or
a
protest
when
little
more
than
two
hours
ago
you
ran
from
what
you
knew
was
to
come
there
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
surely
your
friends
would
have
spared
now
it
is
i
who
do
not
understand
you
said
archie
his
companion
stood
in
front
of
him
searching
his
face
flemington
are
you
lying
on
your
soul
are
you
lying
of
what
use
are
lies
to
me
now
exclaimed
archie
impatiently
truth
is
a
great
luxury
believe
me
i
enjoy
it
you
knew
nothing
of
what
was
waiting
for
us
at
the
top
of
huntly
hill
nothing
as
i
live
said
archie
the
beggar
betrayed
you
said
callandar
when
you
were
gone
he
told
me
that
you
were
in
logie
pay
that
you
would
warn
him
he
was
right
flemington
i
am
not
in
logie
pay
i
never
was
broke
in
archie
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
the
soldier
went
on
but
i
took
him
up
huntly
hill
with
me
and
when
we
had
unsaddled
and
the
men
were
lying
under
the
trees
i
sent
the
corporal
to
brechin
with
the
information
i
went
with
him
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
when
i
came
back
there
was
not
a
man
left
alive
logie
and
ferrier
were
there
with
a
horde
of
their
rebels
they
had
come
to
rescue
the
prisoner
and
he
was
loose
then
he
ferrier
cousin
exclaimed
flemington
we
were
right
one
of
my
men
escaped
continued
callandar
or
i
suppose
so
for
he
was
gone
the
beggar
and
the
other
two
were
killed
and
the
horses
had
stampeded
so
wattie
is
dead
mused
flemington
gad
what
a
voice
has
gone
with
him
they
did
not
see
me
but
i
watched
them
i
saw
him
logie
he
went
off
quickly
and
he
took
one
of
the
beggar
dogs
with
him
snarling
and
struggling
with
his
head
smothered
in
his
coat
then
i
went
down
the
hill
meaning
to
make
for
brechin
and
i
saw
you
coming
back
i
knew
what
you
were
about
thanks
to
that
beggar
neither
spoke
for
a
minute
archie
was
still
sitting
on
the
table
he
had
been
looking
on
the
ground
and
he
raised
his
eyes
to
his
companion
face
something
stirred
in
him
perhaps
at
the
thought
of
how
he
stood
with
fate
he
was
not
given
to
thinking
about
himself
but
he
might
well
do
so
now
callandar
he
said
i
dare
say
you
do
like
me
then
he
broke
off
laughing
how
absurd
he
exclaimed
of
course
you
hate
me
it
is
only
right
you
should
but
perhaps
you
will
understand
i
think
you
will
if
you
will
listen
i
was
thrown
against
logie
no
matter
how
but
unknowing
what
he
did
he
put
his
safety
in
my
hands
he
did
more
i
had
played
upon
his
sympathy
and
in
the
generosity
of
his
heart
he
came
to
my
help
as
one
true
man
might
do
to
another
i
was
not
a
true
man
but
he
did
not
know
that
he
knew
nothing
of
me
but
that
i
stood
in
need
and
he
believed
i
was
as
honest
as
himself
he
thought
i
was
with
his
own
cause
that
was
what
i
wished
him
to
believe
had
almost
told
him
callandar
listened
the
lines
of
his
long
face
set
i
had
watched
him
and
hunted
him
continued
archie
and
my
information
against
him
was
already
in
the
beggar
hands
on
its
way
to
its
mark
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
do
more
against
him
then
what
i
did
afterwards
was
done
without
mention
of
his
name
you
see
callandar
i
have
been
true
to
nobody
he
paused
waiting
for
comment
but
the
other
made
none
after
that
i
went
to
edinburgh
he
continued
and
he
joined
the
prince
then
i
went
north
with
cumberland
i
was
freed
from
my
difficulty
until
they
sent
me
here
to
take
him
the
duke
gave
me
my
orders
himself
and
i
had
to
go
that
ride
with
you
was
hell
callandar
and
when
we
met
the
beggar
i
had
to
make
my
choice
that
was
the
for
me
i
could
not
go
on
he
said
it
was
not
your
wound
that
turned
you
aside
he
was
a
shrewd
rascal
said
flemington
i
wish
i
could
tell
how
he
knew
so
much
about
me
it
was
your
own
tongue
once
you
spent
the
night
in
a
barn
together
when
you
were
from
a
blow
and
you
spoke
all
night
of
logie
you
said
enough
to
put
him
on
your
track
that
is
what
he
told
me
as
we
went
up
huntly
hill
archie
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
rose
up
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
said
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
brechin
come
then
said
archie
we
shall
finish
our
journey
together
after
all
it
has
been
a
hard
day
i
am
glad
it
is
over
they
went
out
together
as
callandar
drew
the
door
to
behind
them
archie
stood
still
if
i
have
dealt
double
with
logie
i
will
not
do
so
with
the
king
said
he
this
is
the
way
out
of
my
difficulty
do
you
understand
me
callandar
the
darkness
hid
the
soldier
face
perhaps
of
all
the
people
who
had
played
their
part
in
the
tangle
of
destiny
character
circumstance
or
whatsoever
influences
had
brought
flemington
to
the
point
at
which
he
stood
he
was
the
one
who
understood
him
best
chapter
xxiv
the
vanity
of
men
the
last
months
had
been
a
time
of
great
anxiety
to
lord
balnillo
in
spite
of
his
fine
steering
and
though
he
had
escaped
from
molestation
he
was
not
comfortable
as
he
saw
the
imprisonments
and
confiscations
that
were
going
on
and
the
precariousness
of
all
that
had
been
secure
disturbed
him
and
made
him
restless
he
was
unsettled
too
by
his
long
stay
in
edinburgh
and
he
hankered
afresh
after
the
town
life
in
which
he
had
spent
so
many
of
his
years
his
trees
and
parks
interested
him
still
but
he
looked
on
them
wondering
how
long
he
would
be
allowed
to
keep
them
he
was
lonely
and
he
missed
james
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
long
before
culloden
the
star
of
whose
destiny
had
led
him
out
again
into
the
world
of
chance
he
had
the
most
upsetting
scheme
under
consideration
that
a
man
of
his
age
can
entertain
at
it
is
few
people
who
think
seriously
of
changing
their
state
yet
this
was
what
david
balnillo
had
in
mind
for
he
had
found
so
many
good
reasons
for
offering
his
hand
to
christian
flemington
that
he
had
decided
at
last
to
take
that
portentous
step
the
greatest
of
these
was
the
effect
that
an
alliance
with
the
whig
lady
would
produce
in
the
quarters
from
which
he
feared
trouble
his
estate
would
be
pretty
safe
if
madam
flemington
reigned
over
it
it
was
pleasant
to
picture
her
magnificent
presence
at
his
table
her
company
would
rid
country
life
of
its
dulness
and
on
the
visits
to
edinburgh
which
he
was
sure
she
would
wish
to
make
the
new
lady
balnillo
would
turn
their
lodging
into
a
bright
spot
in
society
he
smoothed
his
silk
stockings
as
he
imagined
the
stir
that
his
belated
romance
would
make
he
would
be
the
hero
of
it
and
its
heroine
besides
being
a
safeguard
to
his
property
would
be
a
credit
to
himself
there
were
some
obstacles
to
his
plan
and
one
of
them
was
archie
but
he
believed
that
with
a
little
diplomacy
that
particular
difficulty
might
be
overcome
he
would
attack
that
side
of
the
business
in
a
very
straightforward
manner
he
would
make
madam
flemington
understand
that
he
was
enough
to
look
upon
the
episode
in
which
he
had
borne
the
part
of
victim
in
a
reasonable
yet
airy
spirit
in
the
game
in
which
their
political
differences
had
brought
them
face
to
face
the
honours
had
been
with
the
young
man
he
would
admit
that
with
a
smile
and
with
the
respect
that
one
noble
enemy
accords
to
another
he
would
assure
her
that
bygones
should
be
bygones
and
that
when
he
claimed
archie
as
his
he
would
do
so
without
one
grudging
backward
glance
at
the
circumstances
in
which
they
had
first
met
his
magnanimity
seemed
to
him
an
almost
touching
thing
and
he
played
with
the
idea
of
his
own
apposite
grace
when
in
some
sly
but
genial
moment
he
would
suggest
that
the
portrait
upstairs
should
be
finished
what
had
given
the
final
touch
to
his
determination
was
a
message
that
james
had
contrived
to
send
him
which
removed
the
last
scruple
from
his
heart
his
brother
danger
had
weighed
upon
david
and
it
was
not
only
its
convenience
to
himself
at
this
juncture
which
made
him
receive
it
with
relief
logie
was
leaving
the
country
for
holland
and
the
next
tidings
of
him
would
come
from
there
should
he
be
lucky
enough
to
reach
its
shores
alive
since
the
rescue
of
gourlay
the
neighbourhood
of
the
muir
of
pert
the
last
of
his
haunts
in
which
logie
could
trust
himself
had
become
impossible
for
him
and
he
was
now
striving
to
get
to
a
creek
on
the
coast
below
peterhead
it
was
some
time
since
a
roof
had
been
over
him
and
the
little
cottage
from
which
flemington
had
despatched
his
urgent
warning
stood
empty
its
inmate
had
been
his
unsuspected
connection
with
the
world
since
his
time
of
wandering
had
begun
for
though
his
fatal
mistake
in
discovering
this
link
in
his
chain
of
communication
to
flemington
had
made
him
abjure
its
shelter
he
had
had
no
choice
for
some
time
between
the
muir
and
any
other
place
the
western
end
of
the
county
swarmed
with
troops
montrose
was
subdued
the
passes
of
the
grampians
were
watched
there
remained
only
this
barren
tract
west
of
the
river
and
the
warning
brought
to
him
from
a
nameless
source
had
implored
him
to
abandon
it
before
the
soldiery
which
his
informant
assured
him
was
collecting
to
sweep
it
from
end
to
end
should
range
itself
on
its
borders
archie
had
withheld
his
name
when
he
sent
the
dweller
in
the
little
hovel
speeding
into
the
night
he
was
certain
that
in
making
it
known
to
james
he
would
defeat
his
own
ends
for
logie
would
scarcely
be
disposed
to
trust
his
good
faith
and
might
well
look
on
the
message
as
a
trick
to
drive
him
into
some
trap
waiting
for
him
between
the
muir
and
the
sea
james
did
not
give
his
brother
any
details
of
his
projected
flight
he
merely
bade
him
an
indefinite
the
game
was
up
even
he
was
obliged
to
admit
that
and
ferrier
whose
ardent
spirit
had
been
one
with
his
own
since
the
beginning
of
all
things
was
already
making
for
a
fishing
village
from
which
he
hoped
to
be
smuggled
out
upon
the
high
seas
nothing
further
could
be
gained
in
angus
for
the
stuart
cause
the
friends
had
spent
themselves
since
april
in
their
endeavours
to
resuscitate
the
feeling
in
the
country
but
there
was
no
more
money
to
be
raised
no
more
men
to
be
collected
they
told
themselves
that
all
they
could
do
now
was
to
wait
in
the
hope
of
a
day
when
their
services
might
be
needed
again
that
day
would
find
them
both
ready
if
they
were
above
ground
david
knew
that
had
james
been
in
scotland
he
would
not
have
dared
to
think
of
bringing
christian
flemington
to
balnillo
he
had
a
feeling
of
adventure
when
he
started
from
his
own
door
for
ardguys
the
slight
awe
with
which
christian
still
inspired
him
even
when
she
was
most
gracious
was
beginning
to
foreshadow
itself
and
he
knew
that
his
bones
would
be
mighty
stiff
on
the
morrow
there
was
no
riding
of
the
circuit
now
to
keep
him
in
practice
in
the
saddle
but
he
was
not
going
to
give
way
to
silly
apprehensions
unsuited
to
his
age
and
position
he
would
give
himself
every
chance
in
the
way
of
effect
the
servant
who
rode
after
him
carried
a
handsome
for
his
master
to
don
at
forfar
before
making
the
last
stage
of
his
road
it
grieved
balnillo
to
think
how
much
of
the
elegance
of
his
legs
must
be
unrevealed
by
his
high
boots
he
was
a
personable
old
gentleman
and
his
grey
cob
was
worthy
of
carrying
an
eligible
wooer
he
reached
ardguys
and
dismounted
under
its
walls
on
the
following
afternoon
he
had
sent
no
word
in
front
of
him
christian
rose
when
he
was
ushered
into
her
presence
and
laid
down
the
book
in
her
hand
surprised
you
are
as
unexpected
as
an
earthquake
she
exclaimed
as
she
saw
who
was
her
visitor
but
not
as
unwelcome
said
david
far
from
it
sit
down
my
lord
i
had
begun
to
forget
that
civilization
existed
and
now
i
am
reminded
of
it
he
bowed
delighted
a
few
messages
and
compliments
a
letter
or
two
despatched
by
hand
had
been
their
only
communications
since
the
judge
left
edinburgh
and
his
spirits
rose
as
he
found
that
she
seemed
really
pleased
to
see
him
and
what
has
brought
you
asked
christian
settling
herself
with
the
luxurious
deliberation
of
a
cat
into
the
large
chair
from
which
she
had
risen
something
good
certainly
the
simple
desire
to
see
you
could
anything
be
better
it
was
an
excellent
opening
but
he
had
never
even
in
his
youth
been
a
man
who
ran
full
tilt
upon
anything
he
had
scarcely
ever
before
made
so
direct
a
speech
she
smiled
amused
there
had
been
plenty
of
time
for
thought
in
her
solitude
but
though
she
had
thought
a
good
deal
about
him
she
had
not
a
suspicion
of
his
errand
she
saw
people
purely
in
relation
to
the
uses
she
had
for
them
and
officially
she
had
pronounced
him
harmless
to
the
party
in
whose
interests
she
had
kept
him
at
her
side
the
circumstances
were
not
those
which
further
sentiment
i
have
spent
this
quiet
time
in
remembering
your
kindnesses
to
me
he
began
inspired
by
her
smile
you
call
it
a
quiet
time
she
interrupted
i
had
not
looked
on
it
in
that
way
quiet
for
us
perhaps
but
not
for
the
country
true
true
said
he
in
the
tone
in
which
some
people
seek
to
let
unprofitable
subjects
melt
now
that
the
active
part
of
the
rebellion
had
become
history
she
had
no
hesitation
in
speaking
out
from
her
solid
place
on
the
winning
side
this
wretched
struggle
is
over
and
we
may
be
plain
with
one
another
lord
balnillo
she
continued
you
at
least
have
had
much
to
alarm
you
i
have
been
a
peaceful
servant
of
law
and
order
all
my
life
said
he
and
as
such
i
have
conceived
it
my
place
to
stand
aloof
it
has
been
my
duty
to
restrain
violence
of
all
kinds
but
you
have
not
restrained
your
belongings
she
observed
boldly
he
was
so
much
taken
aback
that
he
said
nothing
well
my
lord
it
is
one
of
my
regrets
that
i
have
never
seen
captain
logie
at
least
you
have
to
be
proud
of
a
gallant
man
she
went
on
with
the
same
impulse
that
makes
all
humanity
set
a
fallen
child
upon
its
legs
but
balnillo
had
a
genius
for
scrambling
to
his
feet
my
brother
has
left
the
country
in
safety
he
rejoined
with
one
of
those
random
flashes
of
sharpness
that
had
stood
him
in
such
good
stead
his
cunning
was
his
guardian
angel
for
he
did
not
know
what
she
knew
namely
that
archie
had
left
fort
augustus
in
pursuit
of
james
indeed
she
said
silenced
she
was
terribly
disappointed
but
she
hid
her
feelings
in
barefaced
composure
the
judge
drew
his
chair
closer
here
was
another
opening
and
his
very
nervousness
pushed
him
towards
it
he
began
clearing
his
throat
i
shall
not
despair
of
presenting
james
to
you
when
the
country
is
settled
if
in
short
i
imagine
that
captain
logie
will
hardly
trust
himself
in
scotland
either
in
my
lifetime
or
in
yours
we
are
old
you
and
i
she
added
the
bitterness
of
her
disappointment
surging
through
her
words
she
watched
him
to
see
whether
this
barbed
truth
pierced
him
it
pierced
herself
as
she
hurled
it
maybe
said
he
but
age
has
not
kept
me
from
the
business
i
have
come
upon
i
have
come
to
put
a
very
particular
matter
before
you
she
was
still
unsuspicious
but
she
grew
impatient
he
had
wearied
her
often
in
edinburgh
with
tedious
histories
of
himself
and
she
had
endured
them
then
for
reasons
of
policy
but
she
felt
no
need
of
doing
so
here
it
was
borne
in
upon
her
as
it
has
been
borne
in
upon
many
of
us
that
a
person
who
is
acceptable
in
town
may
be
unendurable
in
the
country
she
had
not
thought
of
that
as
she
welcomed
him
he
went
on
intent
on
nothing
but
his
affair
i
may
surprise
you
i
trust
i
shall
not
offend
you
at
least
you
will
approve
the
feelings
of
devotion
of
respect
of
admiration
which
have
brought
me
here
i
have
an
ancient
name
i
have
sufficient
means
i
am
not
i
believe
are
you
making
me
a
proposal
my
lord
she
spoke
with
an
accent
of
derision
the
sting
of
it
was
sharp
in
her
tone
there
is
no
place
for
ridicule
i
see
nothing
unsuitable
in
my
great
regard
for
you
he
spoke
with
real
dignity
she
had
not
suspected
him
of
having
any
personally
and
she
had
forgotten
that
an
inherited
stock
of
it
was
behind
him
the
rebuke
astonished
her
so
much
that
she
scarcely
knew
what
reply
to
make
as
i
said
i
believe
i
am
not
he
repeated
with
an
air
that
lost
him
his
advantage
i
can
offer
you
such
a
position
as
you
have
a
right
to
expect
you
also
offer
me
a
whose
destination
may
be
the
scaffold
she
said
brutally
do
not
forget
that
this
was
not
to
be
denied
and
for
a
moment
he
was
put
out
but
it
was
on
these
occasions
that
he
shone
let
us
dismiss
family
matters
from
our
minds
and
think
only
of
ourselves
said
he
my
brother
is
an
outlaw
and
as
such
is
unacceptable
to
you
and
your
grandson
has
every
reason
to
be
ashamed
to
meet
me
we
can
set
these
disadvantages
one
against
the
other
and
agree
to
ignore
them
i
am
not
disposed
to
ignore
archie
said
she
well
neither
am
i
hope
i
am
a
man
indeed
no
one
can
sit
on
the
bench
for
the
time
that
i
have
sat
on
it
and
not
realize
the
frailty
of
all
creatures
my
lord
began
christian
but
it
is
something
to
have
learned
continuance
of
speech
professionally
and
balnillo
was
launched
also
his
own
magnanimous
attitude
had
taken
his
fancy
i
will
remember
nothing
against
him
said
he
i
will
forget
his
treatment
of
my
hospitality
and
the
discreditable
uses
to
which
he
put
my
roof
sir
broke
in
christian
i
will
remember
that
according
to
his
lights
he
was
in
the
exercise
of
his
duty
whatsoever
may
be
my
opinion
of
the
profession
to
which
he
was
compelled
i
will
thrust
it
behind
me
with
the
things
best
forgotten
that
is
enough
lord
balnillo
cried
madam
flemington
rising
sit
madam
sit
do
not
disturb
yourself
understand
me
that
i
will
allow
every
leniency
i
will
make
every
excuse
i
will
dwell
not
on
the
fact
that
he
was
a
spy
but
on
his
enviable
relationship
to
yourself
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
threatening
him
with
her
eyes
some
people
tremble
when
roused
to
the
pitch
of
anger
that
she
had
reached
some
gesticulate
christian
was
still
he
had
risen
too
if
you
suppose
that
i
could
connect
myself
with
a
disloyal
house
you
are
much
mistaken
she
said
controlling
herself
with
an
effort
i
have
no
quarrel
with
your
name
lord
balnillo
it
is
old
enough
my
quarrel
is
with
the
treason
in
which
it
has
been
dipped
but
i
am
very
well
content
with
my
own
since
i
have
borne
it
i
have
kept
it
clean
from
any
taint
of
rebellion
but
i
have
been
a
peaceful
man
he
protested
as
i
told
you
the
law
has
been
my
profession
i
have
raised
a
hand
against
no
one
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
you
exclaimed
she
do
you
suppose
that
my
ears
were
shut
in
the
winter
and
that
i
heard
nothing
in
all
the
months
i
spent
in
edinburgh
what
of
that
lord
balnillo
you
made
no
objection
to
me
then
i
was
made
happy
by
being
of
service
to
you
she
laughed
scornfully
let
us
be
done
with
this
she
said
you
have
offered
yourself
to
me
and
i
refuse
the
offer
i
will
add
my
thanks
the
last
words
were
a
masterpiece
of
insolent
civility
a
glass
hung
on
the
wall
one
of
the
possessions
that
she
had
brought
with
her
from
france
david
suddenly
caught
sight
of
his
own
head
reflected
in
it
above
the
lace
cravat
for
which
he
had
paid
so
much
the
spectacle
gathered
up
his
recollections
and
his
present
mortification
and
fused
them
into
one
stab
of
hurt
vanity
i
see
that
you
can
make
no
further
use
of
me
he
said
none
he
walked
out
of
the
room
at
the
door
he
turned
and
bowed
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
call
for
my
horse
myself
said
he
he
went
out
of
the
house
and
she
stood
where
she
was
thinking
of
what
he
had
told
her
about
his
brother
she
had
set
her
heart
upon
success
in
taking
logie
and
now
the
man
had
left
the
country
and
his
chance
was
gone
the
proposal
to
which
she
had
just
listened
did
not
matter
to
her
one
way
or
the
other
though
he
had
offended
her
by
the
attitude
he
took
up
when
making
it
he
was
unimportant
it
was
of
archie
that
she
thought
as
she
watched
the
judge
and
his
servant
ride
away
between
the
they
were
crossing
the
kilpie
burn
when
her
maid
came
in
bringing
a
letter
the
writing
on
it
was
strange
to
christian
who
has
brought
this
she
asked
as
she
opened
it
just
a
callant
replied
the
girl
she
read
the
letter
which
was
short
it
was
signed
callandar
captain
and
was
written
at
archie
flemington
request
to
tell
her
that
he
was
under
arrest
at
brechin
on
a
charge
of
conspiring
with
the
king
enemies
the
writer
added
a
sentence
unknown
as
he
explained
to
flemington
the
matter
is
serious
he
wrote
the
duke
of
cumberland
is
still
in
edinburgh
it
might
be
well
if
you
could
see
him
make
no
delay
as
we
await
his
orders
she
stood
turning
cold
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
maid
eh
losh
mem
whimpered
mysie
approaching
her
with
her
hands
raised
madam
flemington
felt
as
though
her
brain
refused
to
work
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
drive
it
forward
the
world
stood
still
the
walls
an
imprisoning
horror
shut
her
in
from
all
movement
all
action
when
action
was
needed
she
had
never
felt
ardguys
to
be
so
desperately
far
from
the
reach
of
humanity
herself
so
much
cut
off
from
it
as
now
and
yet
she
must
act
her
nearest
channel
of
communication
was
the
judge
riding
away
fool
she
cried
seizing
mysie
run
run
send
the
boy
after
lord
balnillo
tell
him
to
run
the
maid
hesitated
staring
at
the
pallor
of
her
mistress
face
eh
but
mem
sit
you
down
she
wailed
christian
thrust
her
from
her
path
as
though
she
had
been
a
piece
of
furniture
and
swept
into
the
hall
a
barefooted
youth
was
outside
by
the
door
he
stared
at
her
as
mysie
had
done
she
took
him
by
the
shoulder
run
go
instantly
after
those
horses
that
is
lord
balnillo
she
cried
pointing
to
the
riders
who
were
mounting
the
rise
beyond
the
burn
tell
him
to
return
at
once
tell
him
he
must
come
back
he
shook
off
her
grip
and
ran
he
was
a
from
brechin
and
he
had
a
taste
for
sensation
madam
flemington
went
back
into
her
room
mysie
followed
her
whimpering
still
and
she
pushed
her
outside
and
sank
down
in
her
large
chair
she
could
not
watch
the
window
for
fear
of
going
mad
she
sat
still
and
steady
until
she
heard
the
thud
of
bare
feet
on
the
stone
steps
and
then
she
hurried
out
he
me
he
wadna
bide
said
the
breathlessly
he
was
vera
well
obliged
to
ye
he
bad
me
say
but
he
wadna
bide
christian
left
him
and
shut
herself
into
the
room
alone
bald
lines
had
overpowered
her
completely
leaving
no
place
in
her
brain
for
anything
else
but
now
she
saw
her
message
from
lord
balnillo
point
of
view
and
anger
and
contempt
flamed
up
again
even
in
the
midst
of
her
trouble
the
vanity
of
men
ah
god
the
vanity
of
men
she
cried
throwing
out
her
hands
as
though
to
put
the
whole
race
of
them
from
her
chapter
xxv
a
royal
duke
the
duke
of
cumberland
was
at
holyrood
house
he
had
come
down
from
the
north
by
way
of
stirling
and
having
spent
some
days
in
edinburgh
he
was
making
his
final
arrangements
to
set
out
for
england
he
was
returning
in
the
enviable
character
of
conquering
hero
and
he
knew
that
a
great
reception
awaited
him
in
london
where
every
preparation
was
being
made
to
do
him
honour
he
was
thinking
of
these
things
as
he
sat
in
one
of
the
grim
rooms
of
the
ancient
palace
there
was
not
much
luxury
here
and
looking
across
the
table
at
which
he
sat
and
out
of
the
window
he
could
see
the
dirty
roofs
of
the
canongate
a
very
different
prospect
from
the
one
that
would
soon
meet
his
eyes
he
was
sick
of
scotland
papers
were
littered
on
the
table
and
his
secretary
had
just
carried
away
a
bundle
with
him
he
was
alone
because
he
expected
a
lady
to
whom
he
had
promised
an
audience
but
he
was
not
awaiting
her
with
the
feelings
that
he
generally
brought
to
such
occasions
cumberland
had
received
the
visits
of
many
women
alone
since
leaving
england
but
his
guests
were
younger
than
the
one
whose
approach
he
could
now
hear
in
the
anteroom
outside
he
drew
his
brows
together
for
he
expected
no
profit
and
some
annoyance
from
the
interview
he
rose
as
she
was
ushered
in
and
went
to
the
open
fireplace
where
he
stood
awaiting
her
drawn
up
to
his
full
height
which
was
not
great
the
huge
iron
dogs
behind
him
and
the
high
above
his
head
dwarfed
him
with
their
large
lines
he
was
not
an
young
man
though
his
hair
pulled
back
and
tied
after
the
fashion
of
the
day
showed
off
the
receding
contours
that
fell
away
from
his
temples
and
made
his
blue
eyes
look
more
prominent
than
they
were
he
moved
forward
clumsily
as
christian
curtsied
come
in
madam
come
in
be
seated
i
have
a
few
minutes
only
to
give
you
he
said
pointing
to
a
chair
on
the
farther
side
of
the
table
she
sat
down
opposite
to
him
i
had
the
honour
of
being
presented
to
your
royal
highness
last
year
she
said
i
remember
you
well
replied
he
shortly
it
is
in
the
hope
of
being
remembered
that
i
have
come
said
she
it
is
to
ask
you
sir
to
remember
the
services
of
my
house
to
yours
i
remember
them
i
forget
nothing
i
am
asking
you
in
remembering
to
forget
one
thing
said
she
i
shall
not
waste
your
royal
highness
time
and
mine
in
beating
about
bushes
i
have
travelled
here
from
my
home
without
resting
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
delay
now
he
took
up
a
pen
that
lay
beside
him
and
put
the
quill
between
his
teeth
your
royal
highness
knows
why
i
have
come
continued
she
her
eyes
falling
from
his
own
and
fixing
themselves
on
the
pen
in
his
mouth
he
removed
it
with
his
fat
hand
and
tossed
it
aside
there
is
absolute
proof
against
flemington
said
he
he
accuses
himself
i
presume
you
know
that
i
do
this
man
captain
logie
has
some
strange
attraction
for
him
that
i
can
not
understand
and
did
him
some
kindness
that
seems
to
have
turned
his
head
his
regard
for
him
was
a
purely
personal
one
it
was
personal
friendship
that
led
him
to
to
the
madness
he
has
wrought
his
hands
are
clean
of
conspiracy
i
have
come
all
this
way
to
assure
your
highness
of
that
it
is
possible
said
cumberland
the
result
is
the
same
we
have
lost
the
man
whose
existence
above
ground
is
a
danger
to
the
kingdom
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
take
that
difference
of
motive
into
consideration
she
went
on
were
the
faintest
shadow
of
conspiracy
proved
i
should
not
dare
to
approach
you
my
request
should
not
pass
my
lips
i
have
been
in
correspondence
with
him
during
the
whole
of
the
campaign
and
i
know
that
he
served
the
king
loyally
i
beg
your
highness
to
remember
that
now
i
speak
of
his
motive
because
i
know
it
you
are
fortunate
then
he
interrupted
captain
callandar
to
whom
he
gave
himself
up
wrote
me
two
letters
at
his
request
one
in
which
he
announced
his
arrest
and
one
which
i
received
as
i
entered
my
coach
to
leave
my
door
archie
knows
what
is
before
him
she
added
he
has
no
hope
of
life
and
no
knowledge
of
my
action
in
coming
to
your
highness
but
he
wished
me
to
know
the
truth
that
he
had
conspired
with
no
one
he
is
ready
to
suffer
for
what
he
has
done
but
he
will
not
have
me
ashamed
of
him
look
sir
she
pushed
the
letter
over
to
him
his
motives
may
go
hang
madam
said
cumberland
your
highness
if
you
have
any
regard
for
us
who
have
served
you
read
this
he
rose
and
went
back
to
the
fireplace
there
is
no
need
madam
i
am
not
interested
in
the
correspondence
of
others
he
was
becoming
impatient
he
had
spent
enough
time
on
this
lady
she
was
not
young
enough
to
give
him
any
desire
to
detain
her
she
was
an
woman
certainly
but
at
her
age
that
fact
could
matter
to
nobody
he
wondered
casually
whether
the
old
stories
about
her
and
charles
edward
father
were
true
women
struck
him
only
in
one
light
you
will
not
read
this
your
royal
highness
said
christian
with
a
little
tremor
of
voice
no
i
may
tell
you
that
my
decision
has
not
altered
the
case
is
not
one
that
admits
of
any
question
your
highness
said
christian
rising
i
have
never
made
an
abject
appeal
to
anyone
yet
and
even
now
though
i
make
it
to
the
son
of
my
king
i
can
hardly
bring
myself
to
utter
it
i
deplore
my
my
action
from
the
bottom
of
my
soul
i
sent
him
from
me
i
parted
from
him
nearly
a
year
ago
because
of
this
man
logie
he
faced
round
upon
her
and
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
what
he
exclaimed
you
knew
of
this
you
have
been
keeping
this
affair
secret
between
you
he
went
to
montrose
on
the
track
of
logie
in
november
said
she
he
was
sent
there
to
watch
his
movements
before
prince
charles
marched
to
england
and
he
did
so
well
that
he
contrived
to
settle
himself
under
lord
balnillo
roof
in
three
days
he
returned
to
me
he
had
reported
on
logie
movements
i
know
that
your
highness
agents
can
produce
his
report
but
he
returned
to
my
house
to
tell
me
that
for
some
fool
reason
some
private
question
of
sentiment
he
would
follow
logie
no
longer
will
not
go
after
logie
those
were
his
words
madam
began
cumberland
she
put
out
her
hand
and
her
gesture
seemed
to
reverse
their
positions
i
told
him
to
go
i
told
him
that
i
would
sooner
see
him
dead
than
that
he
should
side
with
the
stuarts
he
answered
me
that
he
could
have
no
part
with
rebels
and
that
his
act
concerned
logie
alone
then
he
left
me
and
on
his
way
to
brechin
he
received
orders
to
go
to
the
government
ship
in
montrose
harbour
then
the
ship
was
attacked
and
taken
it
was
flemington
friend
logie
who
was
at
the
bottom
of
that
business
said
cumberland
he
met
logie
and
they
fought
said
madam
flemington
i
know
none
of
the
details
but
i
know
that
they
fought
then
he
went
to
edinburgh
it
is
time
that
we
finished
with
this
exclaimed
cumberland
no
good
is
served
by
it
i
am
near
the
end
your
highness
said
christian
and
then
paused
unnerved
by
the
too
great
suggestiveness
of
her
words
these
things
are
no
concern
of
mine
he
observed
in
the
pause
his
movements
do
not
matter
and
i
may
tell
you
that
my
leisure
is
not
unlimited
it
was
nearing
the
close
of
the
afternoon
and
the
sun
stood
like
a
red
ball
over
the
mists
of
the
edinburgh
smoke
cumberland
business
was
over
for
the
day
and
he
was
looking
forward
to
dining
that
evening
with
a
carefully
chosen
handful
of
friends
male
and
female
her
nerve
was
giving
way
against
the
stubborn
detachment
of
the
man
she
felt
herself
helpless
and
her
force
ineffective
life
was
breaking
up
round
her
the
last
man
she
had
confronted
had
spurned
her
in
the
end
through
a
mistake
it
was
true
but
the
opportunity
had
been
given
him
by
her
own
loss
of
grip
in
the
bewilderment
of
a
crisis
this
one
was
spurning
her
too
but
she
went
on
he
performed
his
work
faithfully
from
that
day
forward
as
your
royal
highness
knew
when
you
took
him
to
the
north
his
services
are
better
known
to
you
sir
than
to
anyone
else
he
gave
himself
up
to
captain
callandar
as
the
last
proof
that
he
could
take
no
part
with
the
rebels
he
threw
away
his
life
at
least
is
true
said
the
duke
with
a
sneer
he
was
becoming
exasperated
and
the
emphasis
which
he
put
on
the
word
brought
the
slow
blood
to
her
face
she
looked
at
him
as
though
she
saw
him
across
some
stream
even
now
her
pride
rose
above
the
despair
in
her
heart
he
was
not
sensitive
but
her
expression
stung
him
i
am
accustomed
to
truth
she
replied
he
turned
his
back
there
was
a
silence
i
came
to
ask
for
archie
life
she
said
in
a
toneless
steady
voice
but
i
will
go
asking
nothing
your
royal
highness
has
nothing
to
give
that
he
or
i
would
stoop
to
take
at
your
hands
he
stood
doggedly
without
turning
and
he
did
not
move
until
the
sound
of
her
sweeping
skirts
had
died
away
in
the
anteroom
then
he
went
out
a
short
stoutish
figure
passing
along
the
dusty
corridors
of
holyrood
and
entered
a
room
from
which
came
the
ring
of
voices
a
party
of
officers
in
uniform
got
up
as
he
came
in
some
were
playing
cards
he
went
up
to
one
of
the
players
and
took
those
he
held
from
between
his
fingers
give
me
your
hand
walden
said
he
and
for
god
sake
get
us
a
bottle
of
wine
damn
me
but
i
hate
old
women
they
should
have
their
tongues
cut
out
chapter
xxvi
the
vanishing
bird
the
houses
of
brechin
climb
from
the
river
up
the
slope
and
a
little
camp
was
spread
upon
the
crest
of
ground
above
them
looking
down
over
the
uneven
pattern
of
walls
the
rising
smoke
and
the
woods
that
cradled
the
esk
such
of
cumberland
soldiery
as
had
collected
in
angus
was
drawn
together
here
and
as
the
country
was
settling
down
the
camp
was
increased
by
detachments
of
horse
and
foot
that
arrived
daily
from
various
directions
the
muir
of
pert
was
bare
left
to
the
company
of
the
and
the
birds
for
james
had
been
traced
to
the
coast
and
the
hungry
north
sea
had
swallowed
his
tracks
the
spot
occupied
by
the
tents
of
callandar
troop
was
in
the
highest
corner
of
the
camp
the
one
farthest
from
the
town
and
the
long
northern
light
that
lingered
over
the
hill
enveloped
the
camp
sounds
and
sights
in
a
still
greenish
clearness
there
would
be
a
bare
few
hours
of
darkness
callandar
was
now
in
command
of
a
small
force
consisting
of
a
troop
of
his
own
regiment
which
had
lately
marched
in
and
two
of
his
men
stood
sentry
outside
the
tent
in
which
archie
flemington
was
sitting
at
an
improvised
table
writing
a
letter
he
had
been
a
close
prisoner
since
his
arrest
on
the
muir
of
pert
and
during
the
week
that
had
elapsed
whilst
correspondence
about
him
and
orders
concerning
him
had
gone
to
and
fro
between
brechin
and
edinburgh
he
had
been
exclusively
under
callandar
charge
that
arrangement
was
the
one
concession
made
on
his
behalf
among
the
many
that
had
been
asked
for
by
his
friends
at
his
own
request
he
was
to
remain
callandar
prisoner
till
the
end
and
it
was
to
be
voice
that
would
give
the
order
for
his
release
at
sunrise
and
callandar
troopers
whose
hands
would
set
him
free
the
two
men
had
spent
much
time
together
though
the
responsibility
did
not
include
the
necessity
of
seeing
much
of
his
prisoner
he
had
chosen
to
spend
nearly
all
his
leisure
in
tent
they
had
drawn
very
near
together
this
incongruous
pair
though
the
chasm
that
lay
between
their
respective
temperaments
had
not
been
bridged
by
words
they
had
sat
together
on
many
evenings
almost
in
silence
playing
cards
until
one
of
them
grew
drowsy
or
some
officious
cock
crowed
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
of
the
incident
which
had
brought
them
into
their
present
relationship
they
spoke
not
at
all
but
sometimes
archie
had
broken
out
into
snatches
of
talk
and
callandar
had
listened
with
his
grim
smile
playing
about
his
mouth
to
his
descriptions
of
the
men
and
things
amongst
which
his
short
life
had
thrown
him
as
he
looked
across
at
his
companion
who
sat
his
eyes
sparkling
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
his
expression
changing
with
the
shades
of
humour
that
ran
over
his
words
like
shadows
over
growing
corn
he
would
be
brought
up
short
against
the
thought
of
the
terrible
incongruity
to
come
death
he
could
not
think
of
archie
and
death
at
times
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
pass
on
his
responsibility
to
some
other
man
and
to
turn
his
back
on
the
place
that
was
to
witness
such
a
tragedy
in
furthering
archie
wishes
by
his
own
application
for
custody
of
him
he
had
given
him
a
great
proof
of
friendship
how
great
he
was
only
to
learn
as
the
days
went
by
would
to
god
it
were
over
so
he
would
say
to
himself
each
night
as
he
left
the
tent
he
had
thought
archie
soft
when
they
parted
at
the
and
he
had
been
sorry
there
was
no
need
for
sorrow
on
that
score
never
had
been
the
sorrow
to
him
now
was
that
so
gallant
so
brilliant
a
creature
was
to
be
cut
off
from
the
life
of
the
world
to
go
down
into
the
darkness
leaving
so
many
of
its
inhabitants
half
alive
to
crawl
on
in
an
existence
which
only
interested
them
inasmuch
as
it
supplied
their
common
needs
his
hostility
against
logie
ran
above
the
level
of
the
just
antagonism
that
a
man
feels
for
his
country
enemy
and
he
questioned
whether
his
life
were
worth
the
price
that
flemington
was
paying
for
it
the
hurried
words
that
archie
had
spoken
about
logie
as
they
left
the
hovel
together
had
told
him
little
and
that
little
seemed
to
him
inadequate
to
explain
the
tremendous
consequences
that
had
followed
what
had
logie
said
or
done
that
had
power
to
turn
him
out
of
his
way
a
man
may
meet
many
admirable
characters
among
his
enemies
without
having
his
efforts
paralyzed
by
the
encounter
flemington
was
not
new
to
his
trade
and
had
been
long
enough
in
the
secret
service
to
know
its
requirements
a
certain
unscrupulousness
was
necessarily
among
them
yet
why
had
his
gorge
only
risen
against
it
now
callandar
could
find
no
signs
in
him
of
the
overwrought
sensibility
that
seemed
to
have
prompted
his
revolt
against
his
task
logie
had
placed
his
safety
in
archie
hands
and
it
was
in
order
to
end
that
safety
that
the
young
man
had
gone
out
he
had
laid
the
trap
and
the
quarry
had
fallen
into
it
what
else
had
he
expected
it
was
not
that
callandar
could
not
understand
the
scruple
what
he
could
not
understand
was
why
a
man
of
archie
occupation
should
suddenly
be
undone
by
it
having
accepted
his
task
his
duty
had
been
plain
in
theory
a
rebel
to
callandar
was
a
rebel
no
more
and
archie
by
his
deed
had
played
a
rebel
part
yet
in
spite
of
that
the
duty
he
must
carry
out
on
the
morrow
was
making
his
heart
sink
within
him
one
thing
about
archie
stood
out
plain
he
was
not
going
to
shirk
his
duty
to
his
king
and
yet
take
government
money
whatsoever
his
doings
the
prisoner
who
sat
in
the
tent
over
yonder
would
be
lying
under
the
earth
because
he
was
prepared
to
pay
the
last
price
for
his
scruple
no
he
was
not
soft
callandar
would
have
died
sooner
than
let
him
escape
yet
his
escape
would
have
made
him
glad
callandar
came
across
the
camp
and
passed
between
the
two
sentries
into
flemington
tent
the
young
man
looked
up
from
his
writing
you
are
busy
said
the
officer
i
have
nearly
done
there
seems
so
much
to
do
at
the
last
he
added
the
other
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
looked
at
him
filled
with
grief
the
lantern
stood
by
archie
hand
his
head
was
bent
into
the
circle
of
light
and
the
yellow
shine
that
fell
upon
it
warmed
his
olive
skin
and
brought
out
the
brown
shades
in
his
brows
and
hair
the
changing
curves
of
his
mouth
were
firm
in
the
intensity
of
his
occupation
he
had
so
much
expression
as
a
rule
that
people
seldom
thought
about
his
features
but
callandar
now
noticed
his
long
chin
and
the
fine
lines
of
his
nostril
his
pen
scratched
on
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
laid
it
down
and
turned
round
you
have
done
me
many
kindnesses
callandar
said
he
and
now
i
am
going
to
ask
you
for
another
the
greatest
of
all
it
is
everything
to
me
that
captain
logie
should
get
this
letter
he
is
safe
i
hope
over
the
water
but
i
do
not
know
where
will
you
take
charge
of
it
i
will
said
the
other
yes
the
very
name
of
logie
went
against
him
you
will
have
to
keep
it
some
little
time
i
fear
continued
archie
but
when
the
country
has
settled
down
you
will
be
able
to
reach
him
through
lord
balnillo
promise
me
that
if
you
can
compass
it
he
shall
get
this
if
it
is
to
be
done
i
will
do
it
from
you
that
is
enough
said
flemington
i
shall
rest
quietly
he
turned
to
his
writing
again
callandar
sat
still
looking
round
the
tent
vaguely
for
something
to
distract
his
heavy
thoughts
a
card
lay
on
the
ground
and
he
picked
it
up
it
was
an
ace
and
the
blank
space
of
white
round
it
was
covered
with
drawing
his
own
consideration
had
procured
pens
and
books
all
that
he
could
find
to
brighten
the
passing
days
for
his
prisoner
this
was
the
result
of
some
impulse
that
had
taken
flemington
artistic
fingers
it
was
a
sketch
of
one
of
the
sentries
outside
the
tent
door
the
figure
was
given
in
a
few
lines
dark
against
the
light
and
the
outline
of
the
man
homely
features
had
gained
some
quality
of
suggestiveness
and
distinction
by
its
passage
through
archie
mind
and
by
the
way
he
had
placed
the
head
against
the
clouded
atmosphere
made
by
the
smoke
rising
from
the
camp
through
it
came
a
vision
of
the
horizon
beyond
the
tents
he
looked
at
it
seeing
something
of
its
cleverness
and
tossed
it
aside
when
archie
had
ended
his
letter
he
read
it
through
when
this
comes
to
your
hands
perhaps
you
will
know
what
has
become
of
me
he
had
written
and
you
will
understand
the
truth
i
ask
you
to
believe
me
if
only
because
these
are
the
last
words
i
shall
ever
write
a
man
speaks
the
truth
when
it
is
a
matter
of
hours
with
him
you
know
what
brought
me
to
balnillo
but
you
do
not
know
what
sent
me
from
it
i
went
because
i
had
no
courage
to
stay
i
was
sent
to
find
out
how
deep
you
were
concerned
in
the
stuart
cause
and
to
watch
your
doings
i
followed
you
that
night
in
the
town
and
my
wrist
bears
the
mark
you
set
on
it
still
that
morning
i
despatched
my
confirmation
of
the
government
suspicions
about
you
then
i
met
you
and
we
sat
by
the
basin
of
montrose
god
knows
i
have
never
forgotten
the
story
you
told
me
logie
i
went
because
i
could
not
strike
you
again
you
had
been
struck
too
hard
in
the
past
and
i
could
not
do
it
what
i
told
you
about
myself
was
untrue
but
you
believed
it
and
would
have
helped
me
how
could
i
go
on
then
as
i
stood
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
my
orders
took
me
to
the
and
we
met
again
on
inchbrayock
i
had
made
sure
you
would
be
on
the
hill
when
i
would
have
escaped
from
you
you
held
me
back
and
as
we
struggled
you
knew
me
for
what
i
was
you
know
the
rest
as
well
as
i
do
and
you
know
where
i
was
in
the
campaign
that
followed
last
of
all
i
was
sent
out
with
those
who
were
to
take
you
on
the
muir
of
pert
i
had
no
choice
but
to
go
the
choice
came
at
the
below
huntly
hill
it
was
i
who
sent
the
warning
to
you
from
the
little
house
on
the
muir
you
had
directed
me
there
for
a
different
purpose
i
sent
no
name
with
my
message
knowing
that
if
i
did
you
might
suspect
me
of
a
trick
to
entrap
you
again
that
is
all
there
remained
only
the
consequences
and
i
shall
be
face
to
face
with
them
there
is
one
thing
more
to
say
do
not
let
yourself
suppose
that
i
am
paying
for
your
life
with
mine
i
might
have
escaped
had
i
tried
to
do
so
it
was
my
fault
that
i
did
not
try
i
had
had
enough
of
untruth
and
i
could
no
longer
take
the
king
money
i
had
served
his
cause
ill
and
i
could
only
pay
for
it
i
have
known
two
true
men
in
my
life
you
and
the
man
who
has
promised
that
you
shall
receive
this
letter
if
you
will
think
of
me
without
bitterness
remember
that
i
should
have
been
glad
archibald
flemington
he
folded
the
paper
and
rose
holding
it
out
to
callandar
i
am
contented
said
he
go
now
callandar
you
look
worn
out
i
believe
this
last
night
is
trying
you
more
than
it
tries
me
it
was
some
little
time
after
daybreak
that
callandar
stood
again
at
the
door
of
the
tent
under
the
kindling
skies
archie
was
waiting
for
him
and
he
came
out
the
eyes
of
the
sentries
never
left
them
as
they
went
away
together
followed
by
the
small
armed
guard
that
was
at
callandar
heels
the
two
walked
a
little
apart
and
when
they
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
they
came
to
a
field
an
insignificant
rough
enclosure
in
which
half
a
dozen
soldiers
were
gathered
waiting
at
the
sight
of
callandar
the
sergeant
who
was
in
charge
of
them
began
to
form
them
in
a
line
some
paces
from
the
wall
callandar
and
flemington
stopped
the
light
had
grown
clear
and
the
smoke
that
was
beginning
to
rise
from
the
town
thickened
the
air
over
the
roofs
that
could
be
seen
from
where
they
stood
the
daily
needs
and
the
daily
avocations
were
beginning
again
for
those
below
the
hill
while
they
were
ceasing
for
ever
for
him
who
stood
above
in
the
cool
morning
in
a
few
minutes
the
sun
would
get
up
already
there
was
a
sign
of
his
coming
in
the
eastward
sky
the
two
men
turned
to
each
other
they
had
nothing
more
to
say
they
had
settled
every
detail
of
this
last
act
of
their
short
companionship
so
that
there
should
be
no
hesitation
no
mistake
nothing
to
be
a
lengthening
of
agony
for
one
nor
an
evil
memory
for
the
other
archie
held
out
his
hand
when
i
look
at
you
he
said
yes
said
callandar
there
are
no
words
callandar
words
are
nothing
but
the
last
bit
of
my
life
has
been
the
better
for
you
for
once
speech
came
quickly
to
the
soldier
the
rest
of
mine
will
be
the
better
for
you
he
answered
you
said
once
that
you
were
not
a
true
man
you
lied
flemington
was
giving
all
to
disprove
the
accusation
of
untruth
and
it
was
one
of
the
last
things
he
was
to
hear
so
with
these
rough
words
more
precious
to
him
than
any
that
could
have
been
spoken
sounding
in
his
ears
he
walked
away
and
stood
before
the
wall
the
men
were
lined
in
front
of
him
his
eyes
roved
for
a
moment
over
the
slope
of
the
country
the
town
roofs
the
camp
then
went
to
the
distance
a
solitary
bird
was
crossing
the
sky
and
his
look
followed
it
as
it
had
followed
the
one
he
had
seen
when
he
made
his
choice
at
the
foot
of
huntly
hill
the
first
had
flown
away
a
vanishing
speck
towards
the
shadows
gathering
about
the
hills
this
one
was
going
into
the
sunrise
it
was
lost
in
the
light
fire
said
callandar
for
archie
was
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
chapter

epilogue
james
logie
stood
at
the
window
of
a
house
in
a
dutch
town
the
pollarded
beech
whose
boughs
were
trimmed
in
a
close
screen
before
the
walls
had
shed
its
golden
leaves
and
the
canal
waters
were
grey
under
a
cloudy
sky
the
long
room
was
rather
dark
and
was
growing
darker
by
the
chair
that
he
had
left
lay
a
yellow
cur
he
had
been
standing
for
some
minutes
reading
a
letter
by
the
fading
light
and
his
back
was
towards
the
man
who
had
brought
it
the
latter
stood
watching
him
stiff
and
tall
an
object
of
suspicion
to
the
dog
as
he
came
to
the
end
the
hand
that
held
the
paper
went
down
to
james
side
the
silence
in
the
room
was
unbroken
for
a
space
when
he
turned
callandar
saw
his
powerful
shoulders
against
the
dusk
and
the
jealous
shadows
of
the
mutilated
arms
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
for
bringing
me
this
said
logie
my
debt
to
you
is
immeasurable
i
did
it
for
him
not
for
you
callandar
spoke
coldly
almost
with
antagonism
i
can
understand
that
said
james
but
something
in
his
voice
struck
the
other
though
he
had
moved
as
if
to
leave
him
he
stopped
and
going
over
to
the
window
drew
a
from
a
pocket
in
his
long
coat
look
he
said
holding
out
the
ace
scrawled
with
the
picture
of
the
sentry
james
took
it
and
as
he
looked
at
it
his
crooked
lip
was
set
stiffly
lest
it
should
tremble
it
was
in
his
tent
when
i
went
back
there
afterwards
said
callandar
he
took
the
card
back
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
it
was
you
began
james
he
was
my
prisoner
sir
james
walked
away
again
and
stood
at
the
window
callandar
waited
silent
i
must
wish
you
a
captain
logie
he
said
at
last
i
have
to
leave
holland
james
followed
him
down
the
staircase
and
they
parted
at
the
outer
door
callandar
went
away
along
the
street
and
james
came
back
slowly
up
the
steep
stairs
his
hand
on
the
railing
of
the
carved
banisters
he
could
scarcely
see
his
way
the
yellow
dog
came
to
meet
him
when
he
entered
his
room
and
as
his
master
still
holding
the
letter
carried
it
again
to
the
light
he
followed
across
the
floor
he
turned
to
sniff
at
an
old
kilmarnock
bonnet
that
lay
by
the
wainscot
near
the
corner
in
which
he
slept
he
put
his
nose
against
it
and
then
looked
at
logie
trust
was
in
his
eyes
and
affection
but
there
was
inquiry
too
