they
could
eat
a
horse
only
luckily
there
was
none
it
might
have
eaten
them
first
hellman
plucked
the
last
radish
out
of
the
can
with
a
pair
of
dividers
he
held
it
up
for
casker
to
admire
then
laid
it
carefully
on
the
workbench
beside
the
razor
hell
of
a
meal
for
two
grown
men
casker
said
flopping
down
in
one
of
the
ship
padded
crash
chairs
if
you
like
to
give
up
your
share
hellman
started
to
suggest
casker
shook
his
head
quickly
hellman
smiled
picked
up
the
razor
and
examined
its
edge
critically
do
make
a
production
out
of
it
casker
said
glancing
at
the
ship
instruments
they
were
approaching
a
red
dwarf
the
only
sun
in
the
vicinity
we
want
to
be
through
with
supper
before
we
get
much
closer
hellman
made
a
practice
incision
in
the
radish
squinting
along
the
top
of
the
razor
casker
bent
closer
his
mouth
open
hellman
poised
the
razor
delicately
and
cut
the
radish
cleanly
in
half
will
you
say
grace
hellman
asked
casker
growled
something
and
popped
a
half
in
his
mouth
hellman
chewed
more
slowly
the
sharp
taste
seemed
to
explode
along
his
disused
tastebuds
not
much
bulk
value
hellman
said
casker
did
answer
he
was
busily
studying
the
red
dwarf
as
he
swallowed
the
last
of
his
radish
hellman
stifled
a
sigh
their
last
meal
had
been
three
days
ago
if
two
biscuits
and
a
cup
of
water
could
be
called
a
meal
this
radish
now
resting
in
the
vast
emptiness
of
their
stomachs
was
the
last
gram
of
food
on
board
ship
two
planets
casker
said
one
burned
to
a
crisp
then
we
land
on
the
other
casker
nodded
and
punched
a
deceleration
spiral
into
the
ship
tape
hellman
found
himself
wondering
for
the
hundredth
time
where
the
fault
had
been
could
he
have
made
out
the
food
requisitions
wrong
when
they
took
on
supplies
at
calao
station
after
all
he
had
been
devoting
most
of
his
attention
to
the
mining
equipment
or
had
the
ground
crew
just
forgotten
to
load
those
last
precious
cases
he
drew
his
belt
in
to
the
fourth
new
notch
he
had
punched
speculation
was
useless
whatever
the
reason
they
were
in
a
jam
ironically
enough
they
had
more
than
enough
fuel
to
take
them
back
to
calao
but
they
would
be
a
pair
of
singularly
emaciated
corpses
by
the
time
the
ship
reached
there
we
coming
in
now
casker
said
and
to
make
matters
worse
this
unexplored
region
of
space
had
few
suns
and
fewer
planets
perhaps
there
was
a
slight
possibility
of
replenishing
their
water
supply
but
the
odds
were
enormous
against
finding
anything
they
could
eat
look
at
that
place
casker
growled
hellman
shook
himself
out
of
his
reverie
the
planet
was
like
a
round
porcupine
the
spines
of
a
million
mountains
glittered
in
the
red
dwarf
feeble
light
and
as
they
spiraled
lower
circling
the
planet
the
pointed
mountains
seemed
to
stretch
out
to
meet
them
it
ca
be
mountains
hellman
said
it
not
sure
enough
there
were
oceans
and
lakes
out
of
which
thrust
jagged
but
no
sign
of
level
land
no
hint
of
civilization
or
even
animal
life
at
least
it
got
an
oxygen
atmosphere
casker
said
their
deceleration
spiral
swept
them
around
the
planet
cutting
lower
into
the
atmosphere
braking
against
it
and
still
there
was
nothing
but
mountains
and
lakes
and
oceans
and
more
mountains
on
the
eighth
run
hellman
caught
sight
of
a
solitary
building
on
a
mountain
top
casker
braked
recklessly
and
the
hull
glowed
red
hot
on
the
eleventh
run
they
made
a
landing
approach
stupid
place
to
build
casker
muttered
the
building
was
and
fitted
nicely
over
the
top
of
the
mountain
there
was
a
wide
level
lip
around
it
which
casker
scorched
as
he
landed
the
ship
from
the
air
the
building
had
merely
seemed
big
on
the
ground
it
was
enormous
hellman
and
casker
walked
up
to
it
slowly
hellman
had
his
burner
ready
but
there
was
no
sign
of
life
this
planet
must
be
abandoned
hellman
said
almost
in
a
whisper
anyone
in
his
right
mind
would
abandon
this
place
casker
said
there
enough
good
planets
around
without
anyone
trying
to
live
on
a
needle
point
they
reached
the
door
hellman
tried
to
open
it
and
found
it
locked
he
looked
back
at
the
spectacular
display
of
mountains
you
know
he
said
when
this
planet
was
still
in
a
molten
state
it
must
have
been
affected
by
several
gigantic
moons
that
are
now
broken
up
the
strains
external
and
internal
wrenched
it
into
its
present
spined
appearance
and
come
off
it
casker
said
ungraciously
you
were
a
librarian
before
you
decided
to
get
rich
on
uranium
hellman
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
burned
a
hole
in
the
doorlock
they
waited
the
only
sound
on
the
mountain
top
was
the
growling
of
their
stomachs
they
entered
the
tremendous
room
was
evidently
a
warehouse
of
sorts
goods
were
piled
to
the
ceiling
scattered
over
the
floor
stacked
haphazardly
against
the
walls
there
were
boxes
and
containers
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
some
big
enough
to
hold
an
elephant
others
the
size
of
thimbles
near
the
door
was
a
dusty
pile
of
books
immediately
hellman
bent
down
to
examine
them
must
be
food
somewhere
in
here
casker
said
his
face
lighting
up
for
the
first
time
in
a
week
he
started
to
open
the
nearest
box
illustration
this
is
interesting
hellman
said
discarding
all
the
books
except
one
let
eat
first
casker
said
ripping
the
top
off
the
box
inside
was
a
brownish
dust
casker
looked
at
it
sniffed
and
made
a
face
very
interesting
indeed
hellman
said
leafing
through
the
book
casker
opened
a
small
can
which
contained
a
glittering
green
slime
he
closed
it
and
opened
another
it
contained
a
dull
orange
slime
hmm
hellman
said
still
reading
hellman
will
you
kindly
drop
that
book
and
help
me
find
some
food
food
hellman
repeated
looking
up
what
makes
you
think
anything
to
eat
here
for
all
you
know
this
could
be
a
paint
factory
it
a
warehouse
casker
shouted
he
opened
a
can
and
lifted
out
a
soft
purple
stick
it
hardened
quickly
and
crumpled
to
dust
as
he
tried
to
smell
it
he
scooped
up
a
handful
of
the
dust
and
brought
it
to
his
mouth
that
might
be
extract
of
strychnine
hellman
said
casually
casker
abruptly
dropped
the
dust
and
wiped
his
hands
after
all
hellman
pointed
out
granted
that
this
is
a
warehouse
a
cache
if
you
wish
we
do
know
what
the
late
inhabitants
considered
good
fare
paris
green
salad
perhaps
with
sulphuric
acid
as
dressing
all
right
casker
said
but
we
got
ta
eat
what
you
going
to
do
about
all
this
he
gestured
at
the
hundreds
of
boxes
cans
and
bottles
the
thing
to
do
hellman
said
briskly
is
to
make
a
qualitative
analysis
on
four
or
five
samples
we
could
start
out
with
a
simple
titration
sublimate
the
chief
ingredient
see
if
it
forms
a
precipitate
work
out
its
molecular
makeup
from
hellman
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
you
a
librarian
remember
and
i
a
correspondence
school
pilot
we
know
anything
about
titrations
and
sublimations
i
know
hellman
said
but
we
should
it
the
right
way
to
go
about
it
sure
in
the
meantime
though
just
until
a
chemist
drops
in
we
do
this
might
help
us
hellman
said
holding
up
the
book
do
you
know
what
it
is
no
casker
said
keeping
a
tight
grip
on
his
patience
it
a
pocket
dictionary
and
guide
to
the
helg
language
helg
the
planet
we
on
the
symbols
match
up
with
those
on
the
boxes
casker
raised
an
eyebrow
never
heard
of
helg
i
do
believe
the
planet
has
ever
had
any
contact
with
earth
hellman
said
this
dictionary
is
casker
remembered
that
aloombrigia
was
the
home
planet
of
a
small
adventurous
reptilian
race
out
near
the
center
of
the
galaxy
how
come
you
can
read
aloombrigian
casker
asked
oh
being
a
librarian
is
a
completely
useless
profession
hellman
said
modestly
in
my
spare
time
yeah
now
how
about
do
you
know
hellman
said
the
aloombrigians
probably
helped
the
helgans
leave
their
planet
and
find
another
they
sell
services
like
that
in
which
case
this
building
very
likely
is
a
food
cache
suppose
you
start
translating
casker
suggested
wearily
and
maybe
find
us
something
to
eat
they
opened
boxes
until
they
found
a
substance
laboriously
hellman
translated
the
symbols
on
it
got
it
he
said
it
reads
sniffners
the
better
abrasive
does
sound
edible
casker
said
i
afraid
not
they
found
another
which
read
vigroom
fill
all
your
stomachs
and
fill
them
right
what
kind
of
animals
do
you
suppose
these
helgans
were
casker
asked
hellman
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
next
label
took
almost
fifteen
minutes
to
translate
it
read
argosel
makes
your
thudra
all
tizzy
contains
thirty
arps
of
ramstat
pulz
for
shell
lubrication
there
must
be
here
we
can
eat
casker
said
with
a
note
of
desperation
i
hope
so
hellman
replied
at
the
end
of
two
hours
they
were
no
closer
they
had
translated
dozens
of
titles
and
sniffed
so
many
substances
that
their
olfactory
senses
had
given
up
in
disgust
let
talk
this
over
hellman
said
sitting
on
a
box
marked
vormitish
good
as
it
sounds
sure
casker
said
sprawling
out
on
the
floor
talk
if
we
could
deduce
what
kind
of
creatures
inhabited
this
planet
know
what
kind
of
food
they
ate
and
whether
it
likely
to
be
edible
for
us
all
we
do
know
is
that
they
wrote
a
lot
of
lousy
advertising
copy
hellman
ignored
that
what
kind
of
intelligent
beings
would
evolve
on
a
planet
that
is
all
mountains
stupid
ones
casker
said
that
was
no
help
but
hellman
found
that
he
could
draw
any
inferences
from
the
mountains
it
did
tell
him
if
the
late
helgans
ate
silicates
or
proteins
or
foods
or
anything
now
look
hellman
said
we
have
to
work
this
out
by
pure
logic
are
you
listening
to
me
sure
casker
said
okay
there
an
old
proverb
that
covers
our
situation
perfectly
man
meat
is
another
man
poison
yeah
casker
said
he
was
positive
his
stomach
had
shrunk
to
approximately
the
size
of
a
marble
we
can
assume
first
that
their
meat
is
our
meat
casker
wrenched
himself
away
from
a
vision
of
five
juicy
roast
beefs
dancing
tantalizingly
before
him
what
if
their
meat
is
our
what
then
then
hellman
said
we
will
assume
that
their
poison
is
our
meat
and
what
happens
if
their
meat
their
poison
are
our
poison
we
starve
all
right
casker
said
standing
up
which
assumption
do
we
start
with
well
there
no
sense
in
asking
for
trouble
this
an
oxygen
planet
if
that
means
anything
let
assume
that
we
can
eat
some
basic
food
of
theirs
if
we
ca
we
start
on
their
poisons
if
we
live
that
long
casker
said
hellman
began
to
translate
labels
they
discarded
such
brands
as
androgynites
delight
and
verbell
for
longer
curlier
more
sensitive
antennae
until
they
found
a
small
gray
box
about
six
inches
by
three
by
three
it
was
called
valkorin
universal
taste
treat
for
all
digestive
capacities
this
looks
as
good
as
any
hellman
said
he
opened
the
box
casker
leaned
over
and
sniffed
no
odor
within
the
box
they
found
a
rectangular
rubbery
red
block
it
quivered
slightly
like
jelly
bite
into
it
casker
said
me
hellman
asked
why
not
you
you
picked
it
i
prefer
just
looking
at
it
hellman
said
with
dignity
i
not
too
hungry
i
not
either
casker
said
they
sat
on
the
floor
and
stared
at
the
jellylike
block
after
ten
minutes
hellman
yawned
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes
all
right
coward
casker
said
bitterly
i
try
it
just
remember
though
if
i
poisoned
you
never
get
off
this
planet
you
do
know
how
to
pilot
just
take
a
little
bite
then
hellman
advised
casker
leaned
over
and
stared
at
the
block
then
he
prodded
it
with
his
thumb
the
rubbery
red
block
giggled
did
you
hear
that
casker
yelped
leaping
back
i
did
hear
anything
hellman
said
his
hands
shaking
go
ahead
casker
prodded
the
block
again
it
giggled
louder
this
time
with
a
disgusting
little
simper
okay
casker
said
what
do
we
try
next
next
what
wrong
with
this
i
do
eat
anything
that
giggles
casker
stated
firmly
now
listen
to
me
hellman
said
the
creatures
who
manufactured
this
might
have
been
trying
to
create
an
esthetic
sound
as
well
as
a
pleasant
shape
and
color
that
giggle
is
probably
only
for
the
amusement
of
the
eater
then
bite
into
it
yourself
casker
offered
hellman
glared
at
him
but
made
no
move
toward
the
rubbery
block
finally
he
said
let
move
it
out
of
the
way
they
pushed
the
block
over
to
a
corner
it
lay
there
giggling
softly
to
itself
now
what
casker
said
hellman
looked
around
at
the
jumbled
stacks
of
incomprehensible
alien
goods
he
noticed
a
door
on
either
side
of
the
room
let
have
a
look
in
the
other
sections
he
suggested
casker
shrugged
his
shoulders
apathetically
slowly
they
trudged
to
the
door
in
the
left
wall
it
was
locked
and
hellman
burned
it
open
with
the
ship
burner
it
was
a
room
piled
with
incomprehensible
alien
goods
the
hike
back
across
the
room
seemed
like
miles
but
they
made
it
only
slightly
out
of
wind
hellman
blew
out
the
lock
and
they
looked
in
it
was
a
room
piled
with
incomprehensible
alien
goods
all
the
same
casker
said
sadly
and
closed
the
door
evidently
there
a
series
of
these
rooms
going
completely
around
the
building
hellman
said
i
wonder
if
we
should
explore
them
casker
calculated
the
distance
around
the
building
compared
it
with
his
remaining
strength
and
sat
down
heavily
on
a
long
gray
object
why
bother
he
asked
hellman
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
certainly
he
should
be
able
to
find
a
key
of
some
sort
a
clue
that
would
tell
him
what
they
could
eat
but
where
was
it
he
examined
the
object
casker
was
sitting
on
it
was
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
large
coffin
with
a
shallow
depression
on
top
it
was
made
of
a
hard
corrugated
substance
what
do
you
suppose
this
is
hellman
asked
does
it
matter
hellman
glanced
at
the
symbols
painted
on
the
side
of
the
object
then
looked
them
up
in
his
dictionary
fascinating
he
murmured
after
a
while
is
it
something
to
eat
casker
asked
with
a
faint
glimmering
of
hope
no
you
are
sitting
on
something
called
the
morog
custom
super
transport
for
the
discriminating
helgan
who
desires
the
best
in
vertical
transportation
it
a
vehicle
oh
casker
said
dully
this
is
important
look
at
it
how
does
it
work
casker
wearily
climbed
off
the
morog
custom
super
transport
and
looked
it
over
carefully
he
traced
four
almost
invisible
separations
on
its
four
corners
retractable
wheels
probably
but
i
do
see
hellman
read
on
it
says
to
give
it
three
amphus
of
integor
fuel
then
a
van
of
tonder
lubrication
and
not
to
run
it
over
three
thousand
ruls
for
the
first
fifty
mungus
let
find
something
to
eat
casker
said
do
you
see
how
important
this
is
hellman
asked
this
could
solve
our
problem
if
we
could
deduce
the
alien
logic
inherent
in
constructing
this
vehicle
we
might
know
the
helgan
thought
pattern
this
in
turn
would
give
us
an
insight
into
their
nervous
systems
which
would
imply
their
biochemical
makeup
casker
stood
still
trying
to
decide
whether
he
had
enough
strength
left
to
strangle
hellman
for
example
hellman
said
what
kind
of
vehicle
would
be
used
in
a
place
like
this
not
one
with
wheels
since
everything
is
up
and
down
perhaps
but
what
of
and
why
did
the
inhabitants
devise
a
boxlike
form
instead
casker
decided
sadly
that
he
did
have
enough
strength
to
strangle
hellman
no
matter
how
pleasant
it
might
be
very
quietly
he
said
kindly
stop
making
like
a
scientist
let
see
if
there
we
can
gulp
down
all
right
hellman
said
sulkily
casker
watched
his
partner
wander
off
among
the
cans
bottles
and
cases
he
wondered
vaguely
where
hellman
got
the
energy
and
decided
that
he
was
just
too
cerebral
to
know
when
he
was
starving
here
something
hellman
called
out
standing
in
front
of
a
large
yellow
vat
what
does
it
say
casker
asked
little
bit
hard
to
translate
but
rendered
freely
it
reads
morishille
voozy
with
added
for
a
new
taste
sensation
everyone
drinks
voozy
good
before
and
after
meals
no
unpleasant
good
for
children
the
drink
of
the
universe
that
sounds
good
casker
admitted
thinking
that
hellman
might
not
be
so
stupid
after
all
this
should
tell
us
once
and
for
all
if
their
meat
our
meat
hellman
said
this
voozy
seems
to
be
the
closest
thing
to
a
universal
drink
i
found
yet
maybe
casker
said
hopefully
maybe
it
just
plain
water
we
see
hellman
pried
open
the
lid
with
the
edge
of
the
burner
within
the
vat
was
a
liquid
no
odor
casker
said
bending
over
the
vat
the
crystal
liquid
lifted
to
meet
him
casker
retreated
so
rapidly
that
he
fell
over
a
box
hellman
helped
him
to
his
feet
and
they
approached
the
vat
again
as
they
came
near
the
liquid
lifted
itself
three
feet
into
the
air
and
moved
toward
them
what
you
done
now
casker
asked
moving
back
carefully
the
liquid
flowed
slowly
over
the
side
of
the
vat
it
began
to
flow
toward
him
hellman
casker
shrieked
hellman
was
standing
to
one
side
perspiration
pouring
down
his
face
reading
his
dictionary
with
a
preoccupied
frown
guess
i
bumbled
the
translation
he
said
do
something
casker
shouted
the
liquid
was
trying
to
back
him
into
a
corner
nothing
i
can
do
hellman
said
reading
on
ah
here
the
error
it
does
say
drinks
voozy
wrong
subject
drinks
that
tells
us
something
the
helgans
must
have
soaked
liquid
in
through
their
pores
naturally
they
would
prefer
to
be
drunk
instead
of
to
drink
casker
tried
to
dodge
around
the
liquid
but
it
cut
him
off
with
a
merry
gurgle
desperately
he
picked
up
a
small
bale
and
threw
it
at
the
voozy
the
voozy
caught
the
bale
and
drank
it
then
it
discarded
that
and
turned
back
to
casker
hellman
tossed
another
box
the
voozy
drank
this
one
and
a
third
and
fourth
that
casker
threw
in
then
apparently
exhausted
it
flowed
back
into
its
vat
casker
clapped
down
the
lid
and
sat
on
it
trembling
violently
not
so
good
hellman
said
we
been
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
helgans
had
eating
habits
like
us
but
of
course
it
necessarily
no
it
does
no
sir
it
certainly
does
i
guess
we
can
see
that
it
does
anyone
can
see
that
it
does
stop
that
hellman
ordered
sternly
we
no
time
for
hysteria
sorry
casker
slowly
moved
away
from
the
voozy
vat
i
guess
we
have
to
assume
that
their
meat
is
our
poison
hellman
said
thoughtfully
so
now
we
see
if
their
poison
is
our
meat
casker
did
say
anything
he
was
wondering
what
would
have
happened
if
the
voozy
had
drunk
him
in
the
corner
the
rubbery
block
was
still
giggling
to
itself
now
here
a
poison
hellman
said
half
an
hour
later
casker
had
recovered
completely
except
for
an
occasional
twitch
of
the
lips
what
does
it
say
he
asked
hellman
rolled
a
tiny
tube
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
it
called
pvastkin
plugger
the
label
reads
warning
highly
dangerous
pvastkin
plugger
is
designed
to
fill
holes
or
cracks
of
not
more
than
two
cubic
vims
however
the
plugger
is
not
to
be
eaten
under
any
circumstances
the
active
ingredient
ramotol
which
makes
so
excellent
a
plugger
renders
it
highly
dangerous
when
taken
internally
sounds
great
casker
said
it
probably
blow
us
do
you
have
any
other
suggestions
hellman
asked
casker
thought
for
a
moment
the
food
of
helg
was
obviously
unpalatable
for
humans
so
perhaps
was
their
poison
but
starvation
better
than
this
sort
of
thing
after
a
moment
communion
with
his
stomach
he
decided
that
starvation
was
better
go
ahead
he
said
hellman
slipped
the
burner
under
his
arm
and
unscrewed
the
top
of
the
little
bottle
he
shook
it
nothing
happened
it
got
a
seal
casker
pointed
out
hellman
punctured
the
seal
with
his
fingernail
and
set
the
bottle
on
the
floor
an
green
froth
began
to
bubble
out
hellman
looked
dubiously
at
the
froth
it
was
congealing
into
a
glob
and
spreading
over
the
floor
yeast
perhaps
he
said
gripping
the
burner
tightly
come
come
faint
heart
never
filled
an
empty
stomach
i
not
holding
back
hellman
said
the
glob
swelled
to
the
size
of
a
man
head
how
long
is
that
supposed
to
go
on
casker
asked
well
hellman
said
it
advertised
as
a
plugger
i
suppose
what
it
does
expands
to
plug
up
holes
sure
but
how
unfortunately
i
do
know
how
much
two
cubic
vims
are
but
it
go
on
much
belatedly
they
noticed
that
the
plugger
had
filled
almost
a
quarter
of
the
room
and
was
showing
no
signs
of
stopping
we
should
have
believed
the
label
casker
yelled
to
him
across
the
spreading
glob
it
dangerous
as
the
plugger
produced
more
surface
it
began
to
accelerate
in
its
growth
a
sticky
edge
touched
hellman
and
he
jumped
back
watch
out
he
could
reach
casker
on
the
other
side
of
the
gigantic
sphere
of
blob
hellman
tried
to
run
around
but
the
plugger
had
spread
cutting
the
room
in
half
it
began
to
swell
toward
the
walls
run
for
it
hellman
yelled
and
rushed
to
the
door
behind
him
he
flung
it
open
just
as
the
expanding
glob
reached
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
he
heard
a
door
slam
shut
hellman
did
wait
any
longer
he
sprinted
through
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
he
stood
for
a
moment
panting
the
burner
in
his
hand
he
realized
how
weak
he
was
that
sprint
had
cut
his
reserves
of
energy
dangerously
close
to
the
collapsing
point
at
least
casker
had
made
it
too
though
but
he
was
still
in
trouble
the
plugger
poured
merrily
through
the
blasted
lock
into
the
room
hellman
tried
a
practice
shot
on
it
but
the
plugger
was
evidently
impervious
as
he
realized
a
good
plugger
should
be
it
was
showing
no
signs
of
fatigue
hellman
hurried
to
the
far
wall
the
door
was
locked
as
the
others
had
been
so
he
burned
out
the
lock
and
went
through
how
far
could
the
glob
expand
how
much
was
two
cubic
vims
two
cubic
miles
perhaps
for
all
he
knew
the
plugger
was
used
to
repair
faults
in
the
crusts
of
planets
in
the
next
room
hellman
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
he
remembered
that
the
building
was
circular
he
would
burn
his
way
through
the
remaining
doors
and
join
casker
they
would
burn
their
way
outside
and
casker
did
have
a
burner
hellman
turned
white
with
shock
casker
had
made
it
into
the
room
on
the
right
because
they
had
burned
it
open
earlier
the
plugger
was
undoubtedly
oozing
into
that
room
through
the
shattered
lock
and
casker
could
get
out
the
plugger
was
on
his
left
a
locked
door
on
his
right
rallying
his
remaining
strength
hellman
began
to
run
boxes
seemed
to
get
in
his
way
purposefully
tripping
him
slowing
him
down
he
blasted
the
next
door
and
hurried
on
to
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
the
plugger
could
expand
into
casker
room
or
could
it
the
rooms
each
a
segment
of
a
circle
seemed
to
stretch
before
him
forever
a
jumbled
montage
of
locked
doors
alien
goods
more
doors
more
goods
hellman
fell
over
a
crate
got
to
his
feet
and
fell
again
he
had
reached
the
limit
of
his
strength
and
passed
it
but
casker
was
his
friend
besides
without
a
pilot
he
never
get
off
the
place
hellman
struggled
through
two
more
rooms
on
trembling
legs
and
then
collapsed
in
front
of
a
third
is
that
you
hellman
he
heard
casker
ask
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
you
all
right
hellman
managed
to
gasp
have
much
room
in
here
casker
said
but
the
plugger
stopped
growing
hellman
get
me
out
of
here
hellman
lay
on
the
floor
panting
moment
he
said
moment
hell
casker
shouted
get
me
out
i
found
water
what
how
get
me
out
of
here
hellman
tried
to
stand
up
but
his
legs
were
cooperating
what
happened
he
asked
when
i
saw
that
glob
filling
the
room
i
figured
i
try
to
start
up
the
super
custom
transport
thought
maybe
it
could
knock
down
the
door
and
get
me
out
so
i
pumped
it
full
of
integor
fuel
yes
hellman
said
still
trying
to
get
his
legs
under
control
that
super
custom
transport
is
an
animal
hellman
and
the
integor
fuel
is
water
now
get
me
out
hellman
lay
back
with
a
contented
sigh
if
he
had
had
a
little
more
time
he
would
have
worked
out
the
whole
thing
himself
by
pure
logic
but
it
was
all
very
apparent
now
the
most
efficient
machine
to
go
over
those
vertical
mountains
would
be
an
animal
probably
with
retractable
suckers
it
was
kept
in
hibernation
between
trips
and
if
it
drank
water
the
other
products
designed
for
it
would
be
palatable
too
of
course
they
still
did
know
much
about
the
late
inhabitants
but
undoubtedly
burn
down
that
door
casker
shrieked
his
voice
breaking
hellman
was
pondering
the
irony
of
it
all
if
one
man
meat
his
poison
are
your
poison
then
try
eating
something
else
so
simple
really
but
there
was
one
thing
that
still
bothered
him
how
did
you
know
it
was
an
animal
he
asked
its
breath
stupid
it
inhales
and
exhales
and
smells
as
if
eaten
onions
there
was
a
sound
of
cans
falling
and
bottles
shattering
now
hurry
what
wrong
hellman
asked
finally
getting
to
his
feet
and
poising
the
burner
the
custom
super
transport
it
got
me
cornered
behind
a
pile
of
cases
hellman
it
seems
to
think
that
i
meat
broiled
with
the
burner
well
done
for
hellman
medium
rare
for
casker
it
was
their
meat
with
enough
left
over
for
the
trip
back
to
