the
feast
at
solhoug
by
henrik
ibsen
from
the
collected
works
of
henrik
ibsen
volume
revised
and
edited
by
william
archer
translation
by
william
archer
and
mary
morrison
exactly
a
year
after
the
production
of
inger
of
that
is
to
say
on
the
foundation
day
of
the
bergen
theatre
january
feast
at
was
produced
the
poet
himself
has
written
its
history
in
full
in
the
preface
to
the
second
edition
the
only
comment
that
need
be
made
upon
his
rejoinder
to
his
critics
has
been
made
with
perfect
fairness
as
it
seems
to
me
by
george
brandes
in
the
following
passage
no
one
who
is
unacquainted
with
the
scandinavian
languages
can
fully
understand
the
charm
that
the
style
and
melody
of
the
old
ballads
exercise
upon
the
scandinavian
mind
the
beautiful
ballads
and
songs
of
knaben
have
perhaps
had
a
similar
power
over
german
minds
but
as
far
as
i
am
aware
no
german
poet
has
has
ever
succeeded
in
inventing
a
metre
suitable
for
dramatic
purposes
which
yet
retained
the
mediaeval
ballad
sonorous
swing
and
rich
aroma
the
explanation
of
the
powerful
impression
produced
in
its
day
by
henrik
dyring
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
in
it
for
the
first
time
the
problem
was
solved
of
how
to
fashion
a
metre
akin
to
that
of
the
heroic
ballads
a
metre
possessing
as
great
mobility
as
the
verse
of
the
along
with
a
dramatic
value
not
inferior
to
that
of
the
pentameter
henrik
ibsen
it
is
true
has
justly
pointed
out
that
as
regards
the
mutual
relations
of
the
principal
characters
owes
more
to
kleist
von
than
feast
at
owes
to
dyring
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
versified
parts
of
the
dialogue
of
both
feast
at
and
are
written
in
that
imitation
of
the
tone
and
style
of
the
heroic
ballad
of
which
hertz
was
the
originator
there
seems
to
me
to
be
no
depreciation
whatever
of
ibsen
in
the
assertion
of
hertz
right
to
rank
as
his
model
even
the
greatest
must
have
learnt
from
some
one
but
while
the
influence
of
danish
lyrical
romanticism
is
apparent
in
the
style
of
the
play
the
structure
as
it
seems
to
me
shows
no
less
clearly
that
influence
of
the
french
which
we
found
so
unmistakably
at
work
in
despite
its
lyrical
dialogue
feast
at
has
that
crispiness
of
dramatic
action
which
marks
the
french
plays
of
the
period
it
may
indeed
be
called
scribe
de
writ
tragic
here
as
in
the
de
one
of
the
earliest
plays
produced
under
ibsen
supervision
we
have
the
rivalry
of
an
older
and
a
younger
woman
for
the
love
of
a
man
who
is
proscribed
on
an
unjust
accusation
and
pursued
by
the
emissaries
of
the
royal
power
one
might
even
though
this
would
be
forcing
the
point
find
an
analogy
in
the
fact
that
the
elder
woman
in
both
plays
a
strong
and
determined
character
has
in
scribe
comedy
a
cowardly
suitor
while
in
ibsen
tragedy
or
melodrama
she
has
a
cowardly
husband
in
every
other
respect
the
plays
are
as
dissimilar
as
possible
yet
it
seems
to
me
far
from
unlikely
that
an
unconscious
reminiscence
of
the
de
may
have
contributed
to
the
shaping
of
feast
at
in
ibsen
mind
but
more
significant
than
any
resemblance
of
theme
is
the
similarity
of
ibsen
whole
method
to
that
of
the
french
school
the
way
for
instance
in
which
misunderstandings
are
kept
up
through
a
careful
avoidance
of
the
use
of
proper
names
and
the
way
in
which
a
cup
of
poison
prepared
for
one
person
comes
into
the
hands
of
another
person
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
drunk
by
no
one
but
occasions
the
acutest
agony
to
the
poisoner
all
this
ingenious
dovetailing
of
incidents
and
of
misunderstandings
ibsen
unquestionably
learned
from
the
french
the
french
language
indeed
is
the
only
one
which
has
a
word
to
indicate
the
class
of
misunderstanding
which
from
down
to
the
of
ibsen
employed
without
scruple
ibsen
first
visit
to
the
home
of
his
future
wife
took
place
after
the
production
of
feast
at
it
seems
doubtful
whether
this
was
actually
his
first
meeting
with
her
but
at
any
rate
we
can
scarcely
suppose
that
he
knew
her
during
the
previous
summer
when
he
was
writing
his
play
it
is
a
curious
coincidence
then
that
he
should
have
found
in
susanna
thoresen
and
her
sister
marie
very
much
the
same
contrast
of
characters
which
had
occupied
him
in
his
first
dramatic
effort
and
which
had
formed
the
main
subject
of
the
play
he
had
just
produced
it
is
less
wonderful
that
the
same
contrast
should
so
often
recur
in
his
later
works
even
down
to
gabriel
ibsen
was
greatly
attached
to
his
gentle
and
retiring
who
died
unmarried
in
feast
at
has
been
translated
by
miss
morison
and
myself
only
because
no
one
else
could
be
found
to
undertake
the
task
we
have
done
our
best
but
neither
of
us
lays
claim
to
any
great
metrical
skill
and
the
light
movement
of
ibsen
verse
is
often
if
not
always
rendered
in
a
sadly
halting
fashion
it
is
however
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
irregularity
of
the
verse
in
the
original
or
its
defiance
of
strict
metrical
law
the
normal
line
is
one
of
four
accents
but
when
this
is
said
it
is
almost
impossible
to
arrive
at
any
further
generalisation
there
is
a
certain
lilting
melody
in
many
passages
and
the
whole
play
has
not
unfairly
been
said
to
possess
the
charm
of
a
northern
summer
night
in
which
the
glimmer
of
twilight
gives
place
only
to
the
gleam
of
morning
but
in
the
main
though
much
better
than
its
successor
it
is
the
weakest
thing
that
ibsen
admitted
into
the
canon
of
his
works
he
wrote
it
in
as
a
study
which
i
now
disown
and
had
he
continued
in
that
frame
of
mind
the
world
would
scarcely
have
quarrelled
with
his
judgment
at
worst
then
my
collaborator
and
i
can
not
be
accused
of
marring
a
masterpiece
but
for
which
assurance
we
should
probably
have
shrunk
from
the
attempt

preface
i
wrote
feast
at
in
bergen
in
the
summer
of
that
is
to
say
about
years
ago
the
play
was
acted
for
the
first
time
on
january
also
at
bergen
as
a
gala
performance
on
the
anniversary
of
the
foundation
of
the
norwegian
stage
as
i
was
then
of
the
bergen
theatre
it
was
i
myself
who
conducted
the
rehearsals
of
my
play
it
received
an
excellent
a
remarkably
sympathetic
interpretation
acted
with
pleasure
and
enthusiasm
it
was
received
in
the
same
spirit
the
bergen
emotionalism
which
is
said
to
have
decided
the
result
of
the
latest
elections
in
those
parts
ran
high
that
evening
in
the
crowded
theatre
the
performance
ended
with
repeated
calls
for
the
author
and
for
the
actors
later
in
the
evening
i
was
serenaded
by
the
orchestra
accompanied
by
a
great
part
of
the
audience
i
almost
think
that
i
went
so
far
as
to
make
some
kind
of
speech
from
my
window
certain
i
am
that
i
felt
extremely
happy
a
couple
of
months
later
feast
of
was
played
in
christiania
there
also
it
was
received
by
the
public
with
much
approbation
and
the
day
after
the
first
performance
bjornson
wrote
a
friendly
youthfully
ardent
article
on
it
in
the
it
was
not
a
notice
or
criticism
proper
but
rather
a
free
fanciful
improvisation
on
the
play
and
the
performance
on
this
however
followed
the
real
criticism
written
by
the
real
critics
how
did
a
man
in
the
christiania
of
those
days
by
which
i
mean
the
years
between
and
or
thereabouts
become
a
real
literary
and
in
particular
dramatic
critic
as
a
rule
the
process
was
as
follows
after
some
preparatory
exercises
in
the
columns
of
the
and
after
the
play
the
future
critic
betook
himself
to
johan
dahl
bookshop
and
ordered
from
copenhagen
a
copy
of
heiberg
among
which
was
to
be
found
so
he
had
heard
it
said
an
essay
entitled
the
this
essay
was
in
due
course
read
ruminated
on
and
possibly
to
a
certain
extent
understood
from
heiberg
writings
the
young
man
moreover
learned
of
a
controversy
which
that
author
had
carried
on
in
his
day
with
professor
oehlenschlager
and
with
the
soro
poet
hauch
and
he
was
simultaneously
made
aware
that
baggesen
the
author
of
from
the
had
at
a
still
earlier
period
made
a
similar
attack
on
the
great
author
who
wrote
both
and
and
a
quantity
of
other
information
useful
to
a
critic
was
to
be
extracted
from
these
writings
from
them
one
learned
for
instance
that
taste
obliged
a
good
critic
to
be
scandalised
by
a
hiatus
did
the
young
critical
jeronimuses
of
christiania
encounter
such
a
monstrosity
in
any
new
verse
they
were
as
certain
as
their
prototype
in
holberg
to
shout
their
the
world
will
not
last
till
easter
the
origin
of
another
peculiar
characteristic
of
the
criticism
then
prevalent
in
the
norwegian
capital
was
long
a
puzzle
to
me
every
time
a
new
author
published
a
book
or
had
a
little
play
acted
our
critics
were
in
the
habit
of
flying
into
an
ungovernable
passion
and
behaving
as
if
the
publication
of
the
book
or
the
performance
of
the
play
were
a
mortal
insult
to
themselves
and
the
newspapers
in
which
they
wrote
as
already
remarked
i
puzzled
long
over
this
peculiarity
at
last
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
whilst
reading
the
danish
journal
of
i
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
old
molbech
was
invariably
seized
with
a
fit
of
rage
when
a
young
author
published
a
book
or
had
a
play
acted
in
copenhagen
thus
or
in
a
manner
closely
resembling
this
had
the
tribunal
qualified
itself
which
now
in
the
daily
press
summoned
feast
at
to
the
bar
of
criticism
in
christiania
it
was
principally
composed
of
young
men
who
as
regards
criticism
lived
upon
loans
from
various
quarters
their
critical
thought
had
long
ago
been
thought
and
expressed
by
others
their
opinions
had
long
ere
now
been
formulated
elsewhere
their
aesthetic
principles
were
borrowed
their
critical
method
was
borrowed
the
polemical
tactics
they
employed
were
borrowed
in
every
particular
great
and
small
their
very
frame
of
mind
was
borrowed
borrowing
borrowing
here
there
and
everywhere
the
single
original
thing
about
them
was
that
they
invariably
made
a
wrong
and
unseasonable
application
of
their
borrowings
it
can
surprise
no
one
that
this
body
the
members
of
which
as
critics
supported
themselves
by
borrowing
should
have
presupposed
similar
action
on
my
part
as
author
two
possibly
more
than
two
of
the
newspapers
promptly
discovered
that
i
had
borrowed
this
that
and
the
other
thing
form
henrik
hertz
play
dyring
this
is
a
baseless
and
indefensible
critical
assertion
it
is
evidently
to
be
ascribed
to
the
fact
that
the
metre
of
the
ancient
ballads
is
employed
in
both
plays
but
my
tone
is
quite
different
from
hertz
the
language
of
my
play
has
a
different
ring
a
light
summer
breeze
plays
over
the
rhythm
of
my
verse
over
that
or
hertz
brood
the
storms
of
autumn
nor
as
regards
the
characters
the
action
and
the
contents
of
the
plays
generally
is
there
any
other
or
any
greater
resemblance
between
them
than
that
which
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
derivation
of
the
subjects
of
both
from
the
narrow
circle
of
ideas
in
which
the
ancient
ballads
move
it
might
be
maintained
with
quite
as
much
or
even
more
reason
that
hertz
in
his
dyring
had
borrowed
and
that
to
no
inconsiderable
extent
from
heinrich
von
kleist
von
a
play
written
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
kathchen
relation
to
count
wetterstrahl
is
in
all
essentials
the
same
as
tagnhild
to
the
knight
stig
hvide
like
ragnhild
kathchen
is
compelled
by
a
mysterious
inexplicable
power
to
follow
the
man
she
loves
wherever
he
goes
to
steal
secretly
after
him
to
lay
herself
down
to
sleep
near
him
to
come
back
to
him
as
by
some
innate
compulsion
however
often
she
may
be
driven
away
and
other
instances
of
supernatural
interference
are
to
be
met
with
both
in
kleist
and
in
hertz
play
but
does
any
one
doubt
that
it
would
be
possible
with
a
little
good
or
a
little
to
discover
among
still
older
dramatic
literature
a
play
from
which
it
could
be
maintained
that
kleist
had
borrowed
here
and
there
in
his
von
i
for
my
part
do
not
doubt
it
but
such
suggestions
of
indebtedness
are
futile
what
makes
a
work
of
art
the
spiritual
property
of
its
creator
is
the
fact
that
he
has
imprinted
on
it
the
stamp
of
his
own
personality
therefore
i
hold
that
in
spite
of
the
points
of
resemblance
dyring
is
as
incontestably
and
entirely
an
original
work
by
henrick
hertz
as
von
is
an
original
work
by
heinrich
von
kleist
i
advance
the
same
claim
on
my
own
behalf
as
regards
feast
at
and
i
trust
that
for
the
future
each
of
the
three
will
be
permitted
to
keep
in
its
entirety
what
rightfully
belongs
to
him
in
writing
feast
of
in
connection
with
george
brandes
expresses
the
opinion
not
that
the
former
play
is
founded
upon
any
idea
borrowed
from
the
latter
but
that
it
has
been
written
under
an
influence
exercised
by
the
older
author
upon
the
younger
brandes
invariably
criticises
my
work
in
such
a
friendly
spirit
that
i
have
all
reason
to
be
obliged
to
him
for
this
suggestion
as
for
so
much
else
nevertheless
i
must
maintain
that
he
too
is
in
this
instance
mistaken
i
have
never
specially
admired
henrik
hertz
as
a
dramatist
hence
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
believe
that
he
should
unknown
to
myself
have
been
able
to
exercise
any
influence
on
by
dramatic
production
as
regards
this
point
and
the
matter
in
general
i
might
confine
myself
to
referring
those
interested
to
the
writings
of
valfrid
vasenius
lecturer
on
aesthetics
at
the
university
of
helsingfors
in
the
thesis
which
gained
him
his
degree
of
doctor
of
philosophy
ibsen
dramatic
poetry
in
its
first
and
also
in
ibsen
the
portrait
of
a
jos
seligman
stockholm
valsenious
states
and
supports
his
views
on
the
subject
of
the
play
at
present
in
question
supplementing
them
in
the
latter
work
by
what
i
told
him
very
briefly
when
we
were
together
at
munich
three
years
ago
but
to
prevent
all
misconception
i
will
now
myself
give
a
short
account
of
the
origin
of
feast
at
i
began
this
preface
with
the
statement
that
feast
at
was
written
in
the
summer
in
i
had
written
inger
of
this
was
a
task
which
had
obliged
me
to
devote
much
attention
to
the
literature
and
history
of
norway
during
the
middle
ages
especially
the
latter
part
of
that
period
i
did
my
utmost
to
familiarise
myself
with
the
manners
and
customs
with
the
emotions
thought
and
language
of
the
men
of
those
days
the
period
however
is
not
one
over
which
the
student
is
tempted
to
linger
nor
does
it
present
much
material
suitable
for
dramatic
treatment
consequently
i
soon
deserted
it
for
the
saga
period
but
the
sagas
of
the
kings
and
in
general
the
more
strictly
historical
traditions
of
that
age
did
not
attract
me
greatly
at
that
time
i
was
unable
to
put
the
quarrels
between
kings
and
chieftains
parties
and
clans
to
any
dramatic
purpose
this
was
to
happen
later
in
the
icelandic
family
sagas
on
the
other
hand
i
found
in
abundance
what
i
required
in
the
shape
of
human
garb
for
the
moods
conceptions
and
thoughts
which
at
that
time
occupied
me
or
were
at
least
more
or
less
distinctly
present
in
my
mind
with
these
old
norse
contributions
to
the
personal
history
of
our
saga
period
i
had
had
no
previous
acquaintance
i
had
hardly
so
much
as
heard
them
named
but
now

excellent
at
least
as
far
as
the
style
is
concerned
fell
into
my
hands
in
the
pages
of
these
family
chronicles
with
their
variety
of
scenes
and
of
relations
between
man
and
man
between
woman
and
woman
in
short
between
human
being
and
human
being
there
met
me
a
personal
eventful
really
living
life
and
as
the
result
of
my
intercourse
with
all
these
distinctly
individual
men
and
women
there
presented
themselves
to
my
mind
eye
the
first
rough
indistinct
outlines
of
vikings
at
how
far
the
details
of
that
drama
then
took
shape
i
am
no
longer
able
to
say
but
i
remember
perfectly
that
the
two
figures
of
which
i
first
caught
sight
were
the
two
women
who
in
course
of
time
became
hiordis
and
dagny
there
was
to
be
a
great
banquet
in
the
play
with
fateful
quarrels
during
its
course
of
other
characters
and
passions
and
situations
produced
by
these
i
meant
to
include
whatever
seemed
to
me
most
typical
of
the
life
which
the
sagas
reveal
in
short
it
was
my
intention
to
reproduce
dramatically
exactly
what
the
saga
of
the
volsungs
gives
in
epic
form
i
made
no
complete
connected
plan
at
that
time
but
it
was
evident
to
me
that
such
a
drama
was
to
be
my
first
undertaking
various
obstacles
intervened
most
of
them
were
of
a
personal
nature
and
these
were
probably
the
most
decisive
but
it
undoubtedly
had
its
significance
that
i
happened
just
at
this
time
to
make
a
careful
study
of
landstad
collection
of
norwegian
ballads
published
two
years
previously
my
mood
of
the
moment
was
more
in
harmony
with
the
literary
romanticism
of
the
middle
ages
than
with
the
deeds
of
the
sagas
with
poetical
than
with
prose
composition
with
the
of
the
ballad
than
with
the
characterisation
of
the
saga
thus
it
happened
that
the
fermenting
formless
design
for
the
tragedy
vikings
at
transformed
itself
temporarily
into
the
lyric
drama
feast
at
the
two
female
characters
the
foster
sisters
hiordis
and
dagny
of
the
projected
tragedy
became
the
sisters
margit
and
signe
of
the
completed
lyric
drama
the
derivation
of
the
latter
pair
from
the
two
women
of
the
saga
at
once
becomes
apparent
when
attention
is
drawn
to
it
the
relationship
is
unmistakable
the
tragic
hero
so
far
only
vaguely
outlined
sigurd
the
viking
the
welcome
guest
at
the
courts
of
kings
became
the
knight
and
minstrel
gudmund
alfson
who
has
likewise
been
long
absent
in
foreign
lands
and
has
lived
in
the
king
household
his
attitude
towards
the
two
sisters
was
changed
to
bring
it
into
accordance
with
the
change
in
time
and
circumstances
but
the
position
of
both
sisters
to
him
remained
practically
the
same
as
that
in
the
projected
and
afterwards
completed
tragedy
the
fateful
banquet
the
presentation
of
which
had
seemed
to
me
of
the
first
importance
in
my
original
plan
became
in
the
drama
the
scene
upon
which
its
personages
made
their
appearance
it
became
the
background
against
which
the
action
stood
out
and
communicated
to
the
picture
as
a
whole
the
general
tone
at
which
i
aimed
the
ending
of
the
play
was
undoubtedly
softened
and
subdued
into
harmony
with
its
character
as
drama
not
tragedy
but
orthodox
aestheticians
may
still
perhaps
find
it
indisputable
whether
in
this
ending
a
touch
of
pure
tragedy
has
not
been
left
behind
to
testify
to
the
origin
of
the
drama
upon
this
subject
however
i
shall
not
enter
at
present
my
object
has
simply
been
to
maintain
and
prove
that
the
play
under
consideration
like
all
my
other
dramatic
works
is
an
inevitable
outcome
of
the
tenor
of
my
life
at
a
certain
period
it
had
its
origin
within
and
was
not
the
result
of
any
outward
impression
or
influence
this

no

let
us
first
hear
your
thought
in
the
matter
margit
rising
sir
knut
gesling
i
have
long
known
all
that
erik
of
hegge
has
told
of
you
i
know
full
well
that
you
come
of
a
lordly
house
you
are
rich
in
gold
and
gear
and
you
stand
in
high
favour
with
our
royal
master
bengt
to
knut
in
high
favour
so
say
i
too
margit
and
doubtless
my
sister
could
choose
her
no
doughtier
mate
bengt
none
doughtier
that
is
what
say
too
margit
if
so
be
that
you
can
win
her
to
think
kindly
of
you
bengt
anxiously
and
half
aside
nay
nay
my
dear
wife
knut
springing
up
stands
it
so
dame
margit
you
think
that
your
sister
bengt
seeking
to
calm
him
nay
nay
knut
gesling
have
patience
now
you
must
understand
us
aright
margit
there
is
naught
in
my
words
to
wound
you
my
sister
knows
you
only
by
the
songs
that
are
made
about
you
and
these
songs
sound
but
ill
in
gentle
ears
no
peaceful
home
is
your
father
house
with
your
lawless
reckless
crew
day
out

in
must
you
hold

you

help
the
maiden

lure
or
buy
with
gold
and
with

soon
will
her
sore
heart
long
to
lie
still
in
the
grave
i
ween
erik
aye
aye
true
enough
knut
gesling
lives
not
overpeaceably
but
there
will
soon
come
a
change
in
that
when
he
gets
him
a
wife
in
his
hall
knut
and
this
i
would
have
you
mark
dame
margit
it
may
be
a
week
since
i
was
at
a
feast
at
hegge
at
erik
bidding
whom
here
you
see
i
vowed
a
vow
that
signe
your
fair
sister
should
be
my
wife
and
that
before
the
year
was
out
never
shall
it
be
said
of
knut
gesling
that
he
brake
any
vow
you
can
see
then
that
you
must
choose
me
for
your
sister
husband
be
it
with
your
will
or
against
it
margit
ere
that
may
be
i
must
tell
you
plain
you
must
rid
yourself
of
your
ravening
train
you
must
scour
no
longer
with
yell
and
shout
the
in
a
galloping
rout
you
must
still
the
shudder
that
spreads
around
when
knut
gesling
is
to
a
bound
courteous
must
your
mien
be
when
you
ride
let
your
hang
at
home
at
the
it
ever
sits
loose
in
your
hand
well
you
know
when
the
mead
has
gone
round
and
your
brain
is
aglow
from
no
man
his
rightful
gear
shall
you
wrest
you
shall
harm
no
harmless
maiden
you
shall
send
no
man
the
shameless
hest
that
when
his
path
crosses
yours
he
were
best
come
with
his
laden
and
if
you
will
so
bear
you
till
the
year
be
past
you
may
win
my
sister
for
your
bride
at
last
knut
with
suppressed
rage
you
know
how
to
order
your
words
cunningly
dame
margit
truly
you
should
have
been
a
priest
and
not
your
husbands
wife
bengt
oh
for
that
matter
i
too
could
knut
paying
no
heed
to
him
but
i
would
have
you
take
note
that
had
a
man
spoken
to
me
in
such
wise
bengt
nay
but
listen
knut
gesling
you
must
understand
us
knut
as
before
well
briefly
he
should
have
learnt
that
the
axe
sits
loose
in
my
hand
as
you
said
but
now
bengt
softly
there
we
have
it
margit
margit
this
will
never
end
well
margit
to
knut
you
asked
for
a
forthright
answer
and
that
i
have
given
you
knut
well
well
i
will
not
reckon
too
closely
with
you
dame
margit
you
have
more
wit
than
all
the
rest
of
us
together
here
is
my
hand
it
may
be
there
was
somewhat
of
reason
in
the
words
you
spoke
to
me
margit
this
i
like
well
now
are
you
already
on
the
right
way
to
amendment
yet
one
word
more
we
hold
a
feast
at
solhoug
knut
a
feast
bengt
yes
knut
gesling
you
must
know
that
it
is
our
wedding
day
this
day
three
years
ago
made
me
dame
margit
husband
margit
impatiently
interrupting
as
i
said
we
hold
a
feast
when
mass
is
over
and
your
other
business
done
i
would
have
you
ride
hither
again
and
join
in
the
banquet
then
you
can
learn
to
know
my
sister
knut
so
be
it
dame
margit
i
thank
you
yet
was
not
to
go
to
mass
that
i
rode
hither
this
morning
your
kinsman
gudmund
alfson
was
the
cause
of
my
coming
margit
starts
he
my
kinsman
where
would
you
seek
him
knut
his
homestead
lies
behind
the
headland
on
the
other
side
of
the
fiord
margit
but
he
himself
is
far
away
erik
be
not
so
sure
he
may
be
nearer
than
you
think
knut
whispers
hold
your
peace
margit
nearer
what
mean
you
knut
have
you
not
heard
then
that
gudmund
alfson
has
come
back
to
norway
he
came
with
the
chancellor
audun
of
hegranes
who
was
sent
to
france
to
bring
home
our
new
queen
margit
true
enough
but
in
these
very
days
the
king
holds
his
feast
in
full
state
at
bergen
and
there
is
gudmund
alfson
a
guest
bengt
and
there
could
we
too
have
been
guests
had
my
wife
so
willed
it
erik
aside
to
knut
then
dame
margit
knows
not
that
knut
aside
so
it
would
seem
but
keep
your
counsel
aloud
well
well
dame
margit
i
must
go
my
way
none
the
less
and
see
what
may
betide
at
nightfall
i
will
be
here
again
margit
and
then
you
must
show
whether
you
have
power
to
bridle
your
unruly
spirit
bengt
aye
mark
you
that
margit
you
must
lay
no
hand
on
your
axe
hear
you
knut
gesling
bengt
neither
on
your
axe
nor
on
your
knife
nor
on
any
other
weapon
whatsoever
margit
for
then
can
you
never
hope
to
be
one
of
our
kindred
bengt
nay
that
is
our
firm
resolve
knut
to
margit
have
no
fear
bengt
and
what
we
have
firmly
resolved
stands
fast
knut
that
i
like
well
sir
bengt
gauteson
i
too
say
the
same
and
i
have
pledged
myself
at
the
to
wed
your
kinswoman
you
may
be
sure
that
my
pledge
too
will
stand
god
peace
till
he
and
erik
with
their
men
go
out
at
the
back
bengt
accompanies
them
to
the
door
the
sound
of
the
bells
has
in
the
meantime
ceased
bengt
returning
methought
he
seemed
to
threaten
us
as
he
departed
margit
absently
aye
so
it
seemed
bengt
knut
gesling
is
an
ill
man
to
fall
out
with
and
when
i
bethink
me
we
gave
him
over
many
hard
words
but
come
let
us
not
brood
over
that
we
must
be
merry
margit
as
i
trow
we
have
both
good
reason
to
be
margit
with
a
weary
smile
aye
surely
surely
bengt
tis
true
i
was
no
mere
stripling
when
i
courted
you
but
well
i
wot
i
was
the
richest
man
for
many
and
many
a
mile
you
were
a
fair
maiden
and
nobly
born
but
your
dowry
would
have
tempted
no
wooer
margit
to
herself
yet
was
i
then
so
rich
bengt
what
said
you
my
wife
margit
oh
nothing
nothing
crosses
to
the
right
i
will
deck
me
with
pearls
and
rings
is
not
a
time
of
rejoicing
for
me
bengt
i
am
fain
to
hear
you
say
it
let
me
see
that
you
deck
you
in
your
best
attire
that
our
guests
may
say
happy
she
who
mated
with
bengt
but
now
must

the
larder
there
are
many
things
that

not
be
he

down
on
a
chair
by
the
table
on

well
he
departed
while
here
he
remains
meseems
the
blood
freezes
within
my
veins
meseems
that
a
crushing
mighty
and
cold
my
heart
in
its
clutches
doth
still
enfold
with
tears
she
can
not
repress
he
is
my
husband
i

how
long
how
long
lasts
a
woman

sixty
years
mayhap
god
pity
me
who

understood
i
could
forget
and
the
words
and
the
thoughts
they
haunt
me
yet
stops
rings
of
red
gold
and
a
belt
beside
was
with
gold
the
wedded
his
bride
in
despair
sinks
down
on
a
bench
beside
the
table
on
the
left
woe
woe
i
myself
am
the
wife
and
there
cometh
none
to
free
me
from
the
prison
of
my
life
signe
radiant
with
gladness
comes
running
in
from
the
back
signe
calling
margit
margit
he
is
coming
margit
starting
up
coming
who
is
coming
signe
gudmund
our
kinsman
margit
gudmund
alfson
here
how
can
you
think
signe
oh
i
am
sure
of
it
margit
crosses
to
the
right
gudmund
alfson
is
at
the
in
the
king
hall
you
know
that
as
well
as
signe
maybe
but
none
the
less
i
am
sure
it
was
he
margit
have
you
seen
him
signe
oh
no
no
but
i
must
tell
you
margit
yes
haste
you
tell
on
signe
was
early
morn
and
the
church
bells
rang
to
mass
i
was
fain
to
ride
the
birds
in
the
willows
twittered
and
sang
in
the
far
and
wide
all
earth
was
glad
in
the
clear
sweet
day
and
from
church
it
had
stayed
me
for
still
as
i
rode
down
the
shady
way
each
rosebud
beguiled
and
delayed
me
silently
into
the
church
i
stole
the
priest
at
the
altar
was
bending
he
chanted
and
read
and
with
awe
in
their
soul
the
folk
to
god
word
were
attending
then
a
voice
rang
out
the
fiord
so
blue
and
the
carven
angels
the
whole
church
through
turned
round
methought
to
listen
thereto
margit
o
signe
say
on
tell
me
all
tell
me
all
signe
was
as
though
a
strange
irresistible
call
summoned
me
forth
from
the
worshipping
flock
over
hill
and
dale
over
mead
and
rock
the
silver
birches
i
listening
trod
moving
as
though
in
a
dream
behind
me
stood
empty
the
house
of
god
priest
and
people
were
lured
by
the
magic
seem
of
the
tones
that
still
through
the
air
did
stream
no
sound
they
made
they
were
quiet
as
death
to
hearken
the
held
their
breath
the
lark
dropped
earthward
the
cuckoo
was
still
as
the
voice
from
hill
to
hill
margit
go
on
signe
they
crossed
themselves
women
and
men
pressing
her
hands
to
her
breast
but
strange
thoughts
arose
within
me
then
for
the
heavenly
song
familiar
grew
gudmund
oft
sang
it
to
me
and
you
ofttimes
has
gudmund
carolled
it
and
all
he
sang
in
my
heart
is
writ
margit
and
you
think
that
it
may
be
signe
i
know
it
is
he
i
know
it
i
know
it
you
soon
shall
see
laughing
from
lands
at
the
last
in
the
end
each
homeward
his
flight
doth
bend
i
am
so
happy
though
why
i
scarce
know
margit
what
say
you
i
quickly
go
and
take
down
his
harp
that
has
hung
so
long
in
there
on
the
wall
that
is
rusted
quite
its
golden
strings
i
will
polish
bright
and
tune
them
to
ring
and
to
sing
with
his
song
margit
absently
do
as
you
will
signe
reproachfully
nay
this
in
not
right
embracing
her
but
when
gudmund
comes
will
your
heart
grow
light

as
when
i
was
a
child
again
margit
so
much
has
changed
ah
so
much
since
then

shall
be

ushers
in
gudmund
alfson
through
the
passage
at
the
back
bengt
and
now
once
more
welcome
under
solhoug
roof
my
wife
kinsman
gudmund
i
thank
you
and
how
goes
it
with
her
she
thrives
well
in
every
way
i
make
no
doubt
bengt
aye
you
may
be
sure
she
does
there
is
nothing
she
lacks
she
has
five
handmaidens
no
less
at
her
beck
and
call
a
courser
stands
ready
saddled
in
the
stall
when
she
lists
to
ride
abroad
in
one
word
she
has
all
that
a
noble
lady
can
desire
to
make
her
happy
in
her
lot
gudmund
and
margit
is
she
then
happy
bengt
god
and
all
men
would
think
that
she
must
be
but
strange
to
say
gudmund
what
mean
you
bengt
well
believe
it
or
not
as
you
list
but
it
seems
to
me
that
margit
was
merrier
of
heart
in
the
days
of
her
poverty
than
since
she
became
the
lady
of
solhoug
gudmund
to
himself
i
knew
it
so
it
must
be
bengt
what
say
you
kinsman
gudmund
i
say
that
i
wonder
greatly
at
what
you
tell
me
of
your
wife
bengt
aye
you
may
be
sure
i
wonder
at
it
too
on
the
faith
and
troth
of
an
honest
gentleman
is
beyond
me
to
guess
what
more
she
can
desire
i
am
about
her
all
day
long
and
no
one
can
say
of
me
that
i
rule
her
harshly
all
the
cares
of
household
and
husbandry
i
have
taken
on
myself
yet
notwithstanding
well
well
you
were
ever
a
merry
heart
i
doubt
not
you
will
bring
sunshine
with
you
hush
here
comes
dame
margit
let
her
not
see
that
i
margit
enters
from
the
left
richly
dressed
gudmund
going
to
meet
her
margit
my
dear
margit
margit
stops
and
looks
at
him
without
recognition
your
pardon
sir
knight
but
as
though
she
only
now
recognized
him
surely
if
i
mistake
not
is
gudmund
alfson
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
gudmund
without
taking
it
and
you
did
not
at
once
know
me
again
bengt
laughing
why
margit
of
what
are
you
thinking
i
told
you
but
a
moment
agone
that
your
kinsman
margit
crossing
to
the
table
on
the
right
twelve
years
is
a
long
time
gudmund
the
freshest
plant
may
wither
ten
times
over
in
that
space
gudmund
is
seven
years
since
last
we
met
margit
surely
it
must
be
more
than
that
gudmund
looking
at
her
i
could
almost
think
so
but
is
as
i
say
margit
how
strange
i
must
have
been
but
a
child
then
and
it
seems
to
me
a
whole
eternity
since
i
was
a
child
throws
herself
down
on
a
chair
well
sit
you
down
my
kinsman
rest
you
for
you
shall
dance
and
rejoice
us
with
your
singing
with
a
forced
smile
doubtless
you
know
we
are
merry
here
we
are
holding
a
feast
gudmund
was
told
me
as
i
entered
your
homestead
bengt
aye
is
three
years
since
i
became
margit
interrupting
my
kinsman
has
already
heard
it
to
gudmund
will
you
not
lay
aside
your
cloak
gudmund
i
thank
you
dame
margit
but
it
seems
to
me
cold
here
colder
than
i
had
foreseen
bengt
for
my
part
i
am
warm
enough
but
then
i
have
a
hundred
things
to
do
and
to
take
order
for
to
margit
let
not
the
time
seem
long
to
our
guest
while
i
am
absent
you
can
talk
together
of
the
old
days
going
margit
hesitating
are
you
going
will
you
not
rather
bengt
laughing
to
gudmund
as
he
comes
forward
again
see
you
well
sir
bengt
of
solhoug
is
the
man
to
make
the
women
fain
of
him
how
short
so
the
space
my
wife
can
not
abide
to
be
without
me
to
margit
caressing
her
content
you
i
shall
soon
be
with
you
again
he
goes
out
to
the
back
margit
to
herself
oh
torture
to
have
to
endure
it
all
a
short
silence
gudmund
how
goes
it
i
pray
with
your
sister
dear
margit
right
well
i
thank
you
gudmund
they
said
she
was
here
with
you
margit
she
has
been
here
ever
since
we
breaks
off
she
came
now
three
years
since
to
solhoug
with
me
after
a
pause
ere
long
she
be
here
her
friend
to
greet
gudmund
well
i
mind
me
of
signe
nature
sweet
no
guile
she
dreamed
of
no
evil
knew
when
i
call
to
remembrance
her
eyes
so
blue
i
must
think
of
the
angels
in
heaven
but
of
years
there
have
passed
no
fewer
than
seven
in
that
time
much
may
have
altered
oh
say
if
she
too
has
changed
so
while
i
been
away
margit
she
too
is
it
pray
in
the
halls
of
kings
that
you
learn
such
courtly
ways
sir
knight
to
remind
me
thus
of
the
change
time
brings
gudmund
nay
margit
my
meaning
you
read
aright
you
were
kind
to
me
both
in
those
years
your
eyes
when
we
parted
were
wet
with
tears
we
swore
like
brother
and
sister
still
to
hold
together
in
good
hap
or
the
other
maids
like
a
sun
you
shone
far
far
and
wide
was
your
beauty
known
you
are
no
less
fair
than
you
were
i
wot
but
solhoug
mistress
i
see
has
forgot
the
penniless
kinsman
so
hard
is
your
mind
that
ever
of
old
was
gentle
and
kind
margit
choking
back
her
tears
aye
of
old
gudmund
looks
compassionately
at
her
is
silent
for
a
little
then
says
in
a
subdued
voice
shall
we
do
as
your
husband
said
pass
the
time
with
talk
of
the
dear
old
days
margit
vehemently
no
no
not
of
them
their
memory
dead
my
mind
unwillingly
backward
strays
tell
rather
of
what
your
life
has
been
of
what
in
the
wide
world
you
done
and
seen
adventures
you
lacked
not
well
i
ween
in
all
the
warmth
and
the
space
out
yonder
that
heart
and
mind
should
be
light
what
wonder
gudmund
in
the
king
high
hall
i
found
not
the
joy
that
i
knew
by
my
own
poor
hearth
as
a
boy
margit
without
looking
at
him
while
i
as
at
solhoug
each
day
flits
past
thank
heaven
that
here
has
my
lot
been
cast
gudmund
is
well
if
for
this
you
can
thankful
be
margit
vehemently
why
not
for
am
i
not
honoured
and
free

not
all
folk
here
obey
my
hest
rule

me
weary
and
sad

heart

spared
your
journey

to
you
that
naught
of
your
outlawry
i
knew
gudmund
it
is
as
i
tell
you
my
life
at
stake
and
to
live
are
all
men
fain
three
nights
like
a
dog
the
sky
i
lain
my
couch
on
the
hillside
forced
to
make
with
for
pillow
the
boulder
grey
though
too
proud
to
knock
at
the
door
of
the
stranger
and
pray
him
for
aid
in
the
hour
of
danger
yet
strong
was
my
hope
as
i
held
on
my
way
i
thought
when
to
solhoug
you
come
at
last
then
all
your
pains
will
be
done
and
past
you
have
sure
friends
there
whatever
but
hope
like
a
wayside
flower
shrivels
up
though
your
husband
met
me
with
flagon
and
cup
and
his
doors
flung
open
wide
within
your
dwelling
seems
chill
and
bare
dark
is
the
hall
my
friends
are
not
there
is
well
i
will
back
to
my
hills
from
your
halls
margit
beseechingly
oh
hear
me
gudmund
my
soul
is
not
base
as
a
thrall
now
life
to
me
seems
a
thing
of
nought
truly
i
hold
it
scarce
worth
a
thought
you
have
killed
all
that
i
hold
most
dear
of
my
fairest
hopes
i
follow
the
bier
farewell
then
dame
margit
margit
nay
gudmund
hear
by
all
that
is
holy
gudmund
live
on
as
before
live
on
in
honour
and
joyance
never
shall
gudmund
darken
your
door
never
shall
cause
you
margit
enough
enough
your
bitterness
you
presently
shall
rue
had
i
known
you
outlawed
shelterless
hunted
the
country
through
trust
me
the
day
that
brought
you
here
would
have
seemed
the
fairest
of
many
a
year
and
a
feast
i
had
counted
it
indeed
when
you
turned
to
solhoug
for
refuge
in
need
gudmund
what
say
you
how
shall
i
read
your
mind
margit
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
read
this
that
at
solhoug
dwell
kinsfolk
kind
gudmund
but
you
said
of
late
margit
to
that
pay
no
heed
or
hear
me
and
understand
indeed
for
me
is
life
but
a
long
black
night
nor
sun
nor
star
for
me
shines
bright
i
have
sold
my
youth
and
my
liberty
and
none
from
my
bargain
can
set
me
free
my
heart
content
i
have
bartered
for
gold
with
gilded
chains
i
have
fettered
myself
trust
me
it
is
but
comfort
cold
to
the
sorrowful
soul
the
pride
of
pelf
how
blithe
was
my
childhood
how
free
from
care
our
house
was
lowly
and
scant
our
store
but
treasures
of
hope
in
my
breast
i
bore
gudmund
whose
eyes
have
been
fixed
upon
her
then
you
were
growing
to
beauty
rare
margit
mayhap
but
the
praises
showered
on
me
caused
the
wreck
of
my
happiness
that
i
now
see
to
lands
away
you
sailed
but
deep
in
my
heart
was
graven
each
song
you
had
ever
sung
and
their
glamour
was
strong
with
a
mist
of
dreams
my
brow
they
veiled
in
them
all
the
joys
you
had
dwelt
upon
that
can
find
a
home
in
the
beating
breast
you
had
sung
so
oft
of
the
lordly
life
knights
and
ladies
and
lo
anon
came
wooers
a
many
from
east
and
from
west
and
so
i
became
bengt
gauteson
wife
gudmund
oh
margit
margit
the
days
that
passed
were
but
few
ere
with
tears
my
folly
i
to
rue
to
think
my
kinsman
and
friend
on
thee
was
all
the
comfort
left
to
me
how
empty
now
seemed
solhoug
hall
how
hateful
and
drear
its
great
rooms
all
hither
came
many
a
knight
and
dame
came
many
a
skald
to
sing
my
fame
but
never
a
one
who
could
fathom
aright
my
spirit
and
all
its
yearning
i
shivered
as
though
in
the
might
yet
my
head
throbbed
my
blood
was
burning
gudmund
but
your
husband
margit
he
never
to
me
was
dear
was
his
gold
was
my
undoing
when
he
spoke
to
me
aye
or
drew
near
my
spirit
writhed
with
ruing
clasping
her
hands
and
thus
have
i
lived
for
three
long
years
a
life
of
sorrow
of
unstanched
tears
your
coming
was
rumoured
you
know
full
well
what
pride
deep
down
in
my
heart
doth
dwell
i
hid
my
anguish
i
veiled
my
woe
for
you
were
the
last
that
the
truth
must
know
gudmund
moved
was
therefore
then
that
you
turned
away
margit
not
looking
at
him
i
thought
you
came
at
my
woe
to
jeer
gudmund
margit
how
could
you
think
margit
nay
nay
there
was
reason
enough
for
such
a
fear
but
thanks
be
to
heaven
that
fear
is
gone
and
now
no
longer
i
stand
alone
my
spirit
now
is
as
light
and
free
as
a
child
at
play
the
greenwood
tree
with
a
sudden
start
of
fear
ah
where
are
my
wits
fled
how
could
i
forget
ye
saints
i
need
sorely
your
succor
yet
an
outlaw
you
said
gudmund
smiling
nay
now
i
at
home
hither
the
king
men
scarce
dare
come
margit
your
fall
has
been
sudden
i
pray
you
tell
how
you
lost
the
king
favour
gudmund
was
thus
it
befell
you
know
how
i
journeyed
to
france
of
late
when
the
chancellor
audun
of
hegranes
fared
thither
from
bergen
in
royal
state
to
lead
home
the
king
bride
the
fair
princess
with
her
squires
and
maidens
and
ducats
bright
sir
audun
a
fair
and
stately
knight
the
princess
shone
with
a
beauty
rare
her
eyes
seemed
full
of
a
burning
prayer
they
would
oft
talk
alone
and
in
whispers
the
two
of
what
that
nobody
guessed
or
knew
there
came
a
night
when
i
leant
at
ease
against
the
galley
railing
my
thought
flew
onward
to
norway
leas
with
the
seagulls
sailing
two
voices
whispered
behind
my
back
i
turned
it
was
he
and
she
i
knew
them
well
though
the
night
was
black
but
they
they
saw
not
me
she
gazed
upon
him
with
sorrowful
eyes
and
whispered
ah
if
to
southern
skies
we
could
turn
the
vessel
prow
and
we
were
alone
in
the
bark
we
twain
my
heart
methinks
would
find
peace
again
nor
would
fever
burn
my
brow
sir
audun
answers
and
straight
she
replies
in
words
so
fierce
so
bold
like
glittering
stars
i
can
see
her
eyes
she
begged
him
breaking
off
my
blood
ran
cold
margit
she
begged
gudmund
i
arose
and
they
vanished
apace
all
was
silent
fore
and
aft
producing
a
small
phial
but
this
i
found
by
their
resting
place
margit
and
that
gudmund
lowering
his
voice
holds
a
secret
draught
a
drop
of
this
in
your
enemy
cup
and
his
life
will
sicken
and
wither
up
no
leechcraft
helps
the
deadly
thing
margit
and
that
gudmund
that
draught
was
meant
for
the
king
margit
great
god
gudmund
putting
up
the
phial
again
that
i
found
it
was
well
for
them
all
in
three
days
more
was
our
voyage
ended
then
i
fled
by
my
faithful
men
attended
for
i
knew
right
well
in
the
royal
hall
that
audun
subtly
would
work
my
fall
accusing
me
margit
aye
but
at
solhoug
he
can
not
harm
you
all
as
of
old
will
be
gudmund
all
nay
margit
you
then
were
free
margit
you
mean
gudmund
i
nay
i
meant
naught
my
brain
is
wildered
but
ah
i
am
blithe
and
fain
to
be
as
of
old
with
you
sisters
twain
but
tell
me
signe
margit
points
smiling
towards
the
door
on
the
left
she
comes
anon
to
greet
her
kinsman
she
needs
must
don
her
trinkets
a
task
that
takes
time
is
plain
gudmund
i
must
see
i
must
see
if
she
knows
me
again
he
goes
out
to
the
left
margit
following
him
with
her
eyes
how
fair
and
manlike
he
is
with
a
sigh
there
is
little
likeness
him
and
begins
putting
things
in
order
on
the
table
but
presently
stops
you
then
were
free
he
said
yes
then
a
short
pause
was
a
strange
tale
that
of
the
princess
who
she
held
another
dear
and
then
aye
those
women
of
lands
i
have
heard
it
before
they
are
not
weak
as
we
are
they
do
not
fear
to
pass
from
thought
to
deed
takes
up
a
goblet
which
stands
on
the
table
was
in
this
beaker
that
gudmund
and
i
when
he
went
away
drank
to
his
happy
return
is
the
only
heirloom
i
brought
with
me
to
solhoug
putting
the
goblet
away
in
a
cupboard
how
soft
is
this
summer
day
and
how
light
it
is
in
here
so
sweetly
has
the
sun
not
shone
for
three
long
years
signe
and
after
her
gudmund
enters
from
the
left
signe
runs
laughing
up
to
margit

will
not
believe
that
is

margit
smiling
to
gudmund
you
see
while
in
lands
you
strayed
she
too
has
altered
the
little
maid
gudmund
aye
truly
but
that
she
should
be
why
a
marvel
in
very
deed
takes
both
signe
hands
and
looks
at
her
yet
when
i
look
in
these
eyes
so
blue
the
innocent
i
still
can
read
yes
signe
i
know
that
is
you
i
needs
must
laugh
when
i
think
how
oft
i
have
thought
of
you
perched
on
my
shoulder
aloft
as
you
used
to
ride
you
were
then
a
child
now
you
are
a
nixie

threatening
with
her
finger
beware
if
the
nixie
ire
you
awaken
soon
in
her
nets
you
will
find
yourself
taken
gudmund
to
himself
i
am
snared
already
it
seems
to
me
signe
but
gudmund
wait
you
have
still
to
see
how
i
shielded
your
harp
from
the
dust
and
the
rust
as
she
goes
out
to
the
left
you
shall
teach
me
all
of
your
songs

must
gudmund
softly
as
he
follows
her
with
his
eyes

has
flushed
to
the
loveliest
rose
of
may
that
was
yet
but
a
bud
in
the
morning
ray

returning
with
the
harp

gudmund
taking
it
my
harp
as
bright
as
of
yore
striking
one
or
two
chords

the
old
chords
ring
sweet
and
clear
on
the
wall
untouched

shalt
hang
no

quavered
around

and

strikes
the
concluding
chords

there
he
was
not

found
if
now
i
went
about

seize

be
minded
to
give

with
deliberation
no
by

moreover
gudmund
is
my

from
bygone
days

he
can
be

decision
therefore
it
shall
be

i
have
said

happy
wonderment
i
am
dear

i
that

i
believe
you

indeed
you
may
list
to
me
signe
the
years
sped
away
but
faithful
was
i
in
my
thoughts
to
you
my
fairest
flowers
ye
sisters
two
my
own
heart
i
could
not
clearly
read
when
i
left
my
signe
was
but
a
child
a
fairy
elf
like
the
creatures
wild
who
play
while
we
sleep
in
wood
and
mead
but
in
solhoug
hall
right
loud
my
heart
spake
and
right
clearly
it
told
me
that
margit
a
lady
proud
whilst
you
the
sweet
maiden
i
love
most
dearly
signe
who
has
only
half
listened
to
his
words
i
mind
me
we
sat
in
the
hearth
red
glow
one
winter
evening
is
long
ago
and
you
sang
to
me
of
the
maiden
fair
whom
the
neckan
had
lured
to
his
watery
lair
there
she
forgot
both
father
and
mother
there
she
forgot
both
sister
and
brother
heaven
and
earth
and
her
christian
speech
and
her
god
she
forgot
them
all
and
each
but
close
by
the
strand
a
stripling
stood
and
he
was
heartsore
and
heavy
of
mood
he
struck
from
his
harpstrings
notes
of
woe
that
wide
the
waters
rang
loud
rang
low
the
maid
in
the
tarn
so
deep
his
strains
awoke
from
her
heavy
sleep
the
neckan
must
grant
her
release
from
his
rule
she
rose
through
the
lilies
afloat
on
the
pool
then
looked
she
to
heaven
while
on
green
earth
she
trod
and
wakened
once
more
to
her
faith
and
her
god
gudmund
signe
my
fairest
of
flowers
signe
it
seems
that
i
too
have
lived
in
a
world
of
dreams
but
the
strange
deep
words
you
have
spoken
of
the
power
of
love
have
my
slumber
broken
the
heavens
seemed
never
so
blue
to
me
never
the
world
so
fair
i
can
understand
as
i
roam
with
thee
the
song
of
the
birds
in
air
gudmund
so
mighty
is
love
it
stirs
in
the
breast
thought
and
longings
and
happy
unrest
but
come
let
us
both
to
your
sister
go
signe
would
you
tell
her
gudmund
everything
she
must
know
signe
then
go
you
alone
i
feel
that
my
cheek
would
be
hot
with
blushes
to
hear
you
speak
gudmund
so
be
it
i
go
signe
and
here
will
i
bide
listening
towards
the
right
or
better
down
by
the
riverside
i
hear
knut
gesling
with
maidens
and
men
gudmund
there
will
you
stay
signe
till
you
come
again
she
goes
out
to
the
right
gudmund
goes
into
the
house
margit
enters
from
behind
the
house
on
the
left
margit
in
the
hall
there
is
gladness
and
revelry
the
dancers
foot
it
with
jest
and
glee
the
air
weighed
hot
on
my
brow
and
breast
for
gudmund
he
was
not
there
she
draws
a
deep
breath
out
here
is
better
here
quiet
and
rest
how
sweet
is
the
cool
night
air
a
brooding
silence
the
horrible
thought
oh
why
should
it
be
that
wherever
i
go
it
follows
me
the
phial
doth
a
secret
contain
a
drop
of
this
in
my
enemy
cup
and
his
life
would
sicken
and
wither
up
the
leech
skill
would
be
tried
in
vain
again
a
silence
were
i
sure
that
gudmund
held
me
dear
then
little
i
care
for
gudmund
enters
from
the
house
gudmund
you
margit
here
and
alone
i
have
sought
you
everywhere
margit
is
cool
here
i
sickened
of
heat
and
glare
see
you
how
yonder
the
white
mists
glide
softly
over
the
marshes
wide
here
it
is
neither
dark
nor
light
but
midway
between
them
to
herself
as
in
my
breast
looking
at
him
not
so
when
you
wander
on
such
a
night
you
hear
though
but
half
to
yourself
confessed
a
stirring
of
secret
life
through
the
hush
in
tree
and
in
leaf
in
flower
and
in
rush
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
can
you
guess
what
i
wish
gudmund
well
margit
that
i
could
be
the
nixie
that
haunts
yonder
upland
lea
how
cunningly
i
should
weave
my
spell
trust
me
gudmund
margit
what
ails
you
tell
margit
paying
no
heed
to
him
how
i
should
quaver
my
magic
lay
quaver
and
croon
it
both
night
and
day
with
growing
vehemence
how
i
would
lure
the
knight
so
bold
through
the
greenwood
glades
to
my
mountain
hold
there
were
the
world
and
its
woes
forgot
in
the
burning
joys
of
our
blissful
lot
gudmund
margit
margit
margit
ever
more
wildly
at
midnight
hour
sweet
were
our
sleep
in
my
lonely
bower
and
if
death
should
come
with
the
dawn
i
trow
sweet
to
die
so
what
thinkest
thou
gudmund
you
are
sick
margit
bursting
into
laughter
ha
ha
let
me
laugh
is
good
to
laugh
when
the
heart
is
in
laughing
mood
gudmund
i
see
that
you
still
have
the
same
wild
soul
as
of
old
margit
with
sudden
seriousness
nay
let
not
that
vex
your
mind
only
at
midnight
it
mocks
control
by
day
i
am
timid
as
any
hind
how
tame
i
have
grown
you
yourself
must
say
when
you
think
on
the
women
in
lands
far
away
of
that
fair
princess
ah
she
was
wild
beside
her
lamblike
am
i
and
mild
she
did
not
helplessly
yearn
and
brood
she
would
have
acted
and
that
gudmund
is
good
you
remind
me
straightway
i
cast
away
what
to
me
is
valueless
after
this
day
takes
out
the
phial
margit
the
phial
you
meant
gudmund
i
thought
it
might
be
at
need
a
friend
that
should
set
me
free
should
the
king
men
chance
to
lay
hands
on
me
but
from
it
has
lost
its
worth
now
will
i
fight
all
the
kings
of
earth
gather
my
kinsfolk
and
friends
to
the
strife
and
battle
right
stoutly
for
freedom
and
life
is
about
to
throw
the
phial
against
a
rock
margit
seizing
his
arm
nay
hold
let
me
have
it
gudmund
first
tell
me
why
margit
i
fain
fling
it
down
to
the
neckan
hard
by
who
so
often
has
made
my
dull
hours
fleet
with
his
harping
and
songs
so
strange
and
sweet
give
it
me
takes
the
phial
from
his
hand
there
feigns
to
throw
it
into
the
river
gudmund
goes
to
the
right
and
looks
down
into
the
ravine
have
you
thrown
it
away
margit
concealing
the
phial
aye
surely
you
saw
whispers
as
she
goes
towards
the
house
now
god
help
and
spare
me
aloud
gudmund
gudmund
approaching
what
would
you
margit
teach
me
i
pray
how
to
interpret
the
ancient
lay
they
sing
of
the
church
in
the
valley
there
a
gentle
knight
and
a
lady
fair
they
loved
each
other
well
that
very
day
on
her
bier
she
lay
he
on
his
fell
they
buried
her
by
the
northward
spire
and
him
by
the
south
kirk
wall
and
theretofore
grew
neither
bush
nor
briar
in
the
hallowed
ground
at
all
but
next
spring
from
their
coffins
twain
two
lilies
fair
upgrew
and
by
and
by
the
high
they
twined
and
they
bloomed
the
whole
year
through
how
read
you
the
riddle
gudmund
looks
searchingly
at
her
i
scarce
can
say
margit
you
may
doubtless
read
it
in
many
a
way
but
its
truest
meaning
methinks
is
clear
the
church
can
never
sever
two
that
hold
each
other
dear
gudmund
to
himself
ye
saints
if
she
should
lest
worse
befall
time
indeed
i
told
her
all
aloud
do
you
wish
for
my
happiness
margit
tell
margit
in
joyful
agitation
wish
for
it
i
gudmund
then
wot
you
well
the
joy
of
my
life
now
rests
with
you
margit
with
an
outburst
gudmund
gudmund
listen
is
the
time
you
knew
he
stops
suddenly
voices
and
laughter
are
heard
by
the
river
bank
signe
and
other
girls
enter
from
the
right
accompanied
by
knut
erik
and
several
younger
men
knut
still
at
a
distance
gudmund
alfson
wait
i
must
speak
a
word
with
you
he
stops
talking
to
erik
the
other
guests
in
the
meantime
enter
the
house
margit
to
herself
the
joy
of
his
life
what
else
can
he
mean
but
half
aloud
signe
my
dear
dear
sister
she
puts
her
arm
round
signe
waist
and
they
go
towards
the
back
talking
to
each
other
gudmund
softly
as
he
follows
them
with
his
eyes
aye
so
it
were
wisest
both
signe
and
i
must
away
from
solhoug
knut
gesling
has
shown
himself
my
friend
he
will
help
me
knut
softly
to
erik
yes
yes
i
say
gudmund
is
her
kinsman
he
can
best
plead
my
cause
erik
well
as
you
will
he
goes
into
the
house
knut
approaching
listen
gudmund
gudmund
smiling
come
you
to
tell
me
that
you
dare
no
longer
let
me
go
free
knut
dare
be
at
your
ease
as
to
that
knut
gesling
dares
whatever
he
will
no
is
another
matter
you
know
that
here
in
the
district
i
am
held
to
be
a
wild
unruly
companion
gudmund
aye
and
if
rumour
lies
not
knut
why
no
much
that
it
reports
may
be
true
enough
but
now
i
must
tell
you
they
go
conversing
up
towards
the
back
signe
to
margit
as
they
come
forward
beside
the
house
i
understand
you
not
you
speak
as
though
an
happiness
had
befallen
you
what
is
in
your
mind
margit
signe
you
are
still
a
child
you
know
not
what
it
means
to
have
ever
in
your
heart
the
dread
of
suddenly
breaking
off
think
signe
what
it
must
be
to
wither
and
die
without
ever
having
lived
signe
looks
at
her
in
astonishment
and
shakes
her
head
nay
but
margit
margit
aye
aye
you
do
not
understand
but
none
the
less
they
go
up
again
talking
to
each
other
gudmund
and
knut
come
down
on
the
other
side
gudmund
well
if
so
it
be
if
this
wild
life
no
longer
contents
you
then
i
will
give
you
the
best
counsel
that
ever
friend
gave
to
friend
take
to
wife
an
honourable
maiden
knut
say
you
so
and
if
i
now
told
you
that
is
even
that
i
have
in
mind
gudmund
good
luck
and
happiness
to
you
then
knut
gesling
and
now
you
must
know
that
i
too
knut
you
are
you
too
so
purposed
gudmund
aye
truly
but
the
king
wrath
i
am
a
banished
man
knut
nay
to
that
you
need
give
but
little
thought
as
yet
there
is
no
one
here
save
dame
margit
that
knows
aught
of
the
matter
and
so
long
as
i
am
your
friend
you
have
one
in
whom
you
can
trust
securely
now
i
must
tell
you
he
proceeds
in
a
whisper
as
they
go
up
again
signe
as
she
and
margit
again
advance
but
tell
me
then
margit
margit
more
i
dare
not
tell
you
signe
then
will
i
be
more
than
you
but
first
answer
me
one
question
bashfully
with
hesitation
is
there
no
one
who
has
told
you
anything
concerning
me
margit
concerning
you
nay
what
should
that
be
signe
as
before
looking
downwards
you
said
to
me
this
morning
if
a
wooer
came
riding
hither
margit
that
is
true
to
herself
knut
gesling
has
he
already
eagerly
to
signe
well
what
then
signe
softly
but
with
exultation
the
wooer
has
come
he
has
come
margit
i
knew
not
then
whom
you
meant
but
now
margit
and
what
have
you
answered
him
signe
oh
how
should
i
know
flinging
her
arms
round
her
neck
but
the
world
seems
to
me
so
rich
and
beautiful
since
the
moment
when
he
told
me
that
he
held
me
dear
margit
why
signe
signe
i
can
not
understand
that
you
should
so
quickly
you
scarce
knew
him
before
signe
oh
is
but
little
i
yet
know
of
love
but
this
i
know
that
what
the
song
says
is
true
full
swiftly
is
sown
ere
a
moment
speeds
by
deep
deep
in
the
heart
love
is
rooted
for
aye
margit
so
be
it
and
since
so
it
is
i
need
no
longer
hold
aught
concealed
from
you
ah
she
stops
suddenly
as
she
sees
knut
and
gudmund
approaching
knut
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
ha
this
is
as
i
would
have
it
gudmund
here
is
my
hand
margit
to
herself
what
is
this
gudmund
to
knut
and
here
is
mine
they
shake
hands
knut
but
now
we
must
each
of
us
name
who
it
is
gudmund
good
here
at
solhoug
among
so
many
fair
women
i
have
found
her
whom
knut
i
too
and
i
will
bear
her
home
this
very
night
if
it
be
needful
margit
who
has
approached
unobserved
all
saints
in
heaven
gudmund
nods
to
knut
the
same
is
my
intent
signe
who
has
also
been
listening
gudmund
gudmund
and
knut
whispering
to
each
other
as
they
both
point
at
signe
there
she
is
gudmund
starting
aye
mine
knut
likewise
no
mine
margit
softly
half
bewildered
signe
gudmund
as
before
to
knut
what
mean
you
by
that
knut
i
mean
that
is
signe
whom
i
gudmund
signe
signe
is
my
betrothed
in
the
sight
of
god
margit
with
a
cry
it
was
she
no
no
gudmund
to
himself
as
he
catches
sight
of
her
margit
she
has
heard
everything
knut
ho
ho
so
this
is
how
it
stands
nay
dame
margit
is
needless
to
put
on
such
an
air
of
wonder
now
i
understand
everything
margit
to
signe
but
not
a
moment
ago
you
said
suddenly
grasping
the
situation
was
gudmund
you
meant
signe
astonished
yes
did
you
not
know
it
but
what
ails
you
margit
margit
in
an
almost
toneless
voice
nay
nothing
nothing
knut
to
margit
and
this
morning
when
you
made
me
give
my
word
that
i
would
stir
no
strife
here
you
already
knew
that
gudmund
alfson
was
coming
ha
ha
think
not
that
you
can
hoodwink
knut
gesling
signe
has
become
dear
to
me
even
this
morning
but
my
hasty
vow
that
drove
me
to
seek
her
hand
but
now
signe
to
margit
he
was
this
the
wooer
that
was
in
your
mind
margit
hush
hush
knut
firmly
and
harshly
dame
margit
you
are
her
elder
sister
you
shall
give
me
an
answer
margit
battling
with
herself
signe
has
already
made
her
choice
i
have
naught
to
answer
knut
good
then
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
at
solhoug
but
after
midnight
mark
you
this
the
day
is
at
an
end
then
you
may
chance
to
see
me
again
and
then
fortune
must
decide
whether
it
be
gudmund
or
i
that
shall
bear
signe
away
from
this
house
gudmund
aye
try
if
you
dare
it
shall
cost
you
a
bloody
sconce
signe
in
terror
gudmund
by
all
the
saints
knut
gently
gently
gudmund
alfson
ere
sunrise
you
shall
be
in
my
power
and
she
your
goes
up
to
the
door
beckons
and
calls
in
a
low
voice
erik
erik
come
hither
we
must
away
to
our
kinsfolk
threateningly
while
erik
shows
himself
in
the
doorway
woe
upon
you
all
when
i
come
again
he
and
erik
go
off
to
the
left
at
the
back
signe
softly
to
gudmund
oh
tell
me
what
does
all
this
mean
gudmund
whispering
we
must
both
leave
solhoug
this
very
night

gudmund

your
sister

imploringly

tempted
him

hill
and
through
forest
be
sure
you
turn
not
round
be
sure
you
never
look
back
the
huldra
sits
laughing
behind
every
bush
and
when
all
is
done
in
a
low
voice
coming
close
up
to
him
you
will
go
no
further

gudmund
to

saints
in

surely
she
would
not
margit
it
was
a
fair
and
noble
maid
she
dwelt
in
her
father
hall
both
linen
and
silk
did
she
broider
and
braid
yet
found
in
it
solace
small
for
she
sat
there
alone
in
cheerless
state
empty
were
hall
and
bower
in
the
pride
of
her
heart
she
was
fain
to
mate
with
a
chieftain
of
pelf
and
power
but
now
was
the
hill
king
he
rode
from
the
north
with
his
henchmen
and
his
gold
on
the
third
day
at
night
he
in
triumph
fared
forth
bearing
her
to
his
mountain
hold
full
many
a
summer
she
dwelt
in
the
hill
out
of
beakers
of
gold
she
could
drink
at
her
will
oh
fair
are
the
flowers
of
the
valley
i
trow
but
only
in
dreams
can
she
gather
them
now
was
a
youth
right
gentle
and
bold
to
boot
struck
his
harp
with
such
magic
might
that
it
rang
to
the
mountain
inmost
root
where
she
languished
in
the
night
the
sound
in
her
soul
waked
a
wondrous
mood
wide
open
the
seemed
to
stand
the
peace
of
god
lay
over
the
land
and
she
saw
how
it
all
was
fair
and
good
there
happened
what
never
had
happened
before
she
had
wakened
to
life
as
his
thrilled
and
her
eyes
were
opened
to
all
the
store
of
treasure
wherewith
the
good
earth
is
filled
for
mark
this
well
it
hath
ever
been
found
that
those
who
in
caverns
deep
lie
bound
are
lightly
freed
by
the
harp
glad
sound
he
saw
her
prisoned
he
heard
her
wail
but
he
cast
unheeding
his
harp
aside
hoisted
straightway
his
silken
sail
and
sped
away
the
waters
wide
to
stranger
strands
with
his
bride
with
passion
so
fair
was
thy
touch
on
the
golden
strings
that
my
breast
heaves
high
and
my
spirit
sings
i
must
out
i
must
out
to
the
sweet
green
leas
i
die
in
the
fastnesses
he
mocks
at
my
woe
as
he
clasps
his
bride
and
sails
away
the
waters
wide
shrieks
with
me
all
is
over
my
barred
unsunned
is
the

night
all
unstarred

totters
and
fainting

short
pause
she
leans
back
in
her
chair
i
once
heard
a
tale
of
a
child
blind
from
birth
whose
childhood
was
full
of
joy
and
mirth
for
the
mother
with
spells
of
magic
might
wove
for
the
dark
eyes
a
world
of
light
and
the
child
looked
forth
with
wonder
and
glee
upon
the
valley
and
hill
upon
land
and
sea
then
suddenly
the
witchcraft
failed
the
child
once
more
was
in
darkness
pent
to
games
and
merriment
with
longing
vain
the
red
cheeks
paled
and
its
wail
of
woe
as
it
pined
away
was
ceaseless
and
sadder
than
words
can
oh
like
the
child
my
eyes
were
sealed
to
the
light
and
the
life
of
summer
blind
she
springs
up
but
now
and
i
in
this
cage
confined
no
now
is
the
worth
of
my
youth
revealed
three
years
of
life
i
on
him
have
spent
my
husband
but
were
i
longer
content
this
hapless
hopeless
weird
to
dree
meek
as
a
dove
i
needs
must
be
i
am
wearied
to
death
of
petty
brawls
the
stirring
life
of
the
great
world
calls
i
will
follow
gudmund
with
shield
and
bow
i
will
share
his
joys
i
will
soothe
his
woe

him
both
by
night
and
day
all
that
behold

envy
the
life
of
the
valiant
knight
and

his
wife
wrings
her
hands
oh
god
what
is
this
i
say
forgive
me

me
and
oh
let
me
feel
the
peace
that
hath
power
both
to
soothe
and
to
heal
walks
back
and
forward
brooding
silently
signe
my
sister
how
hateful
to
steal
her
glad
young
life
from

but
who
can
tell
in
very
sooth

may
love
him
but
with
the
light
love
of
youth
again
silence

takes
out
the
little
phial

long
at
it

breath

phial

its
powers
