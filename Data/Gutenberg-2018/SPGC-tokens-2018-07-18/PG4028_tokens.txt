this
tale
of
my
life
i
write
to
thank
the
god
of
nature
who
conveyed
my
soul
to
me
and
with
such
care
hath
stayed
that
divers
noble
deeds
brought
to
light
he
subdued
my
cruel
spite
life
glory
virtue
measureless
hath
made
such
grace

through
me
displayed
that
few

rival
none
surpass
me
quite
only
it
grieves
me
when
i
understand
what
precious
time
in
vanity
the
wind
it
beareth
frail
thoughts
away
yet
since
remorse
avails
not
content
as
erst
i
came
welcome

go
one
day

fair

land
introductory
note
among
the
vast
number
of
men
who
have
thought
fit
to
write
down
the
history
of
their
own
lives
three
or
four
have
achieved
masterpieces
which
stand
out
preeminently
saint
augustine
in
his
samuel
pepys
in
his
rousseau
in
his
it
is
among
these
extraordinary
documents
and
unsurpassed
by
any
of
them
that
the
autobiography
of
benvenuto
cellini
takes
its
place
the
of
himself
which
cellini
wrote
was
due
to
other
motives
than
those
which
produced
its
chief
competitors
for
first
place
in
its
class
aim
was
religious
and
didactic
pepys
noted
down
in
his
diary
the
daily
events
of
his
life
for
his
sole
satisfaction
and
with
no
intention
that
any
one
should
read
the
cipher
in
which
they
were
recorded
but
cellini
wrote
that
the
world
might
know
after
he
was
dead
what
a
fellow
he
had
been
what
great
things
he
had
attempted
and
against
what
odds
he
had
carried
them
through
men
he
held
be
their
condition
who
have
done
anything
of
merit
or
which
verily
has
a
semblance
of
merit
if
so
be
they
are
men
of
truth
and
good
repute
should
write
the
tale
of
their
life
with
their
own
that
he
had
done
many
things
of
merit
he
had
no
manner
of
doubt
his
repute
was
great
in
his
day
and
perhaps
good
in
the
sense
in
which
he
meant
goodness
as
to
whether
he
was
a
man
of
truth
there
is
still
dispute
among
scholars
of
some
misrepresentations
some
suppressions
of
damaging
facts
there
seems
to
be
evidence
only
too
man
with
passion
for
proving
himself
in
the
right
could
hardly
have
avoided
being
guilty
of
but
of
the
general
trustworthiness
of
his
record
of
the
kind
of
man
he
was
and
the
kind
of
life
he
led
there
is
no
reasonable
doubt
the
period
covered
by
the
autobiography
is
from
birth
in
to
the
scene
is
mainly
in
italy
and
france
of
the
great
events
of
the
time
the
time
of
the
reformation
and
the
of
the
strife
of
pope
and
emperor
and
king
we
get
only
glimpses
the
leaders
in
these
events
appear
in
the
foreground
of
the
picture
only
when
they
come
into
personal
relations
with
the
hero
and
then
not
mainly
as
statesmen
or
warriors
but
as
connoisseurs
and
patrons
of
art
such
an
event
as
the
sack
of
rome
is
described
because
benvenuto
himself
fought
in
it
much
more
complete
is
the
view
he
gives
of
the
artistic
life
of
the
time
it
was
the
age
of
michelangelo
and
in
the
throng
of
great
artists
which
then
filled
the
italian
cities
cellini
was
no
inconsiderable
figure
michelangelo
himself
he
knew
and
adored
nowhere
can
we
gain
a
better
idea
than
in
this
book
of
the
passionate
enthusiasm
for
the
creation
of
beauty
which
has
bestowed
upon
the
italy
of
the
renaissance
its
greatest
glory
very
vivid
too
is
the
impression
we
receive
of
the
social
life
of
the
sixteenth
century
of
its
violence
and
licentiousness
of
its
zeal
for
fine
craftsmanship
of
its
abounding
vitality
its
versatility
and
its
idealism
for
cellini
himself
is
an
epitome
of
that
century
this
man
who
tells
here
the
story
of
his
life
was
a
murderer
and
a
braggart
insolent
sensual
inordinately
proud
and
passionate
but
he
was
also
a
worker
in
gold
and
silver
rejoicing
in
delicate
chasing
and
subtle
modelling
of
precious
surfaces
a
sculptor
and
a
musician
and
as
all
who
read
his
book
must
testify
a
great
master
of
narrative
keen
as
was
interest
in
himself
and
much
as
he
loved
to
dwell
on
the
splendor
of
his
exploits
and
achievements
he
had
little
idea
that
centuries
after
his
death
he
would
live
again
less
by
his
and
his
work
than
by
the
book
which
he
dictated
casually
to
a
lad
of
fourteen
while
he
went
about
his
work
the
autobiography
was
composed
between
and
but
it
brings
the
record
down
only
to
the
remainder
of
life
seems
to
have
been
somewhat
more
peaceful
in
he
married
piera
de
salvadore
parigi
a
servant
who
had
nursed
him
when
he
was
sick
and
in
the
care
of
his
children
as
earlier
of
his
sister
and
nieces
he
showed
more
tenderness
than
might
have
been
expected
from
a
man
of
his
boisterous
nature
he
died
at
florence
may
and
was
buried
in
the
church
of
the
annunziata
in
that
city
autobiography
of
benvenuto
cellini
i
all
men
of
whatsoever
quality
they
be
who
have
done
anything
of
excellence
or
which
may
properly
resemble
excellence
ought
if
they
are
persons
of
truth
and
honesty
to
describe
their
life
with
their
own
hand
but
they
ought
not
to
attempt
so
fine
an
enterprise
till
they
have
passed
the
age
of
forty
this
duty
occurs
to
my
own
mind
now
that
i
am
travelling
beyond
the
term
of
years
and
am
in
florence
the
city
of
my
birth
many
untoward
things
can
i
remember
such
as
happen
to
all
who
live
upon
our
earth
and
from
those
adversities
i
am
now
more
free
than
at
any
previous
period
of
my
it
seems
to
me
that
i
enjoy
greater
content
of
soul
and
health
of
body
than
ever
i
did
in
bygone
years
i
can
also
bring
to
mind
some
pleasant
goods
and
some
inestimable
evils
which
when
i
turn
my
thoughts
backward
strike
terror
in
me
and
astonishment
that
i
should
have
reached
this
age
of
wherein
thanks
be
to
god
i
am
still
travelling
prosperously
forward
ii
it
is
true
that
men
who
have
laboured
with
some
show
of
excellence
have
already
given
knowledge
of
themselves
to
the
world
and
this
alone
ought
to
suffice
them
i
mean
the
fact
that
they
have
proved
their
manhood
and
achieved
renown
yet
one
must
needs
live
like
others
and
so
in
a
work
like
this
there
will
always
be
found
occasion
for
natural
bragging
which
is
of
divers
kinds
and
the
first
is
that
a
man
should
let
others
know
he
draws
his
lineage
from
persons
of
worth
and
most
ancient
origin
i
am
called
benvenuto
cellini
son
of
maestro
giovanni
son
of
andrea
son
of
cristofano
cellini
my
mother
was
madonna
elisabetta
daughter
to
stefano
granacci
both
parents
citizens
of
florence
it
is
found
written
in
chronicles
made
by
our
ancestors
of
florence
men
of
old
time
and
of
credibility
even
as
giovanni
villani
writes
that
the
city
of
florence
was
evidently
built
in
imitation
of
the
fair
city
of
rome
and
certain
remnants
of
the
colosseum
and
the
baths
can
yet
be
traced
these
things
are
near
santa
croce
the
capitol
was
where
is
now
the
old
market
the
rotonda
is
entire
which
was
made
for
the
temple
of
mars
and
is
now
dedicated
to
our
saint
john
that
thus
is
was
can
very
well
be
seen
and
can
not
be
denied
but
the
said
buildings
are
much
smaller
than
those
of
rome
he
who
caused
them
to
built
they
say
was
julius
cćsar
in
concert
with
some
noble
romans
who
when
fiesole
had
been
stormed
and
taken
raised
a
city
in
this
place
and
each
of
them
took
in
hand
to
erect
one
of
these
notable
edifices
julius
cćsar
had
among
his
captains
a
man
of
highest
rank
and
valour
who
was
called
fiorino
of
cellino
which
is
a
village
about
two
miles
distant
from
monte
fiascone
now
this
fiorino
took
up
his
quarters
under
the
hill
of
fiesole
on
the
ground
where
florence
now
stands
in
order
to
be
near
the
river
arno
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
troops
all
those
soldiers
and
others
who
had
to
do
with
the
said
captain
used
then
to
say
us
go
to
fiorenze
as
well
because
the
said
captain
was
called
fiorino
as
also
because
the
place
he
had
chosen
for
his
quarters
was
by
nature
very
rich
in
flowers
upon
the
foundation
of
the
city
therefore
since
this
name
struck
julius
cćsar
as
being
fair
and
apt
and
given
by
circumstance
and
seeing
furthermore
that
flowers
themselves
bring
good
augury
he
appointed
the
name
of
florence
for
the
town
he
wished
besides
to
pay
his
valiant
captain
this
compliment
and
he
loved
him
all
the
more
for
having
drawn
him
from
a
very
humble
place
and
for
the
reason
that
so
excellent
a
man
was
a
creature
of
his
own
the
name
that
learned
inventors
and
investigators
of
such
etymologies
adduce
as
that
florence
is
flowing
at
the
arno
can
not
hold
seeing
that
rome
is
flowing
at
the
tiber
ferrara
is
flowing
at
the
po
lyons
is
flowing
at
the
saone
paris
is
flowing
at
the
seine
and
yet
the
names
of
all
these
towns
are
different
and
have
come
to
them
by
other
ways
thus
then
we
find
and
thus
we
believe
that
we
are
descended
from
a
man
of
worth
furthermore
we
find
that
there
are
cellinis
of
our
stock
in
ravenna
that
most
ancient
town
of
italy
where
too
are
plenty
of
gentle
folk
in
pisa
also
there
are
some
and
i
have
discovered
them
in
many
parts
of
christendom
and
in
this
state
also
the
breed
exists
men
devoted
to
the
profession
of
arms
for
not
many
years
ago
a
young
man
called
luca
cellini
a
beardless
youth
fought
with
a
soldier
of
experience
and
a
most
valorous
man
named
francesco
da
vicorati
who
had
frequently
fought
before
in
single
combat
this
luca
by
his
own
valour
with
sword
in
hand
overcame
and
slew
him
with
such
bravery
and
stoutness
that
he
moved
the
folk
to
wonder
who
were
expecting
quite
the
contrary
issue
so
that
i
glory
in
tracing
my
descent
from
men
of
valour
as
for
the
trifling
honours
which
i
have
gained
for
my
house
under
the
conditions
of
our
present
ways
of
living
and
by
means
of
my
art
albeit
the
same
are
matters
of
no
great
moment
i
will
relate
these
in
their
proper
time
and
place
taking
much
more
pride
in
having
been
born
humble
and
having
laid
some
honourable
foundation
for
my
family
than
if
i
had
been
born
of
great
lineage
and
had
stained
or
overclouded
that
by
my
base
qualities
so
then
i
will
make
a
beginning
by
saying
how
it
pleased
god
i
should
be
born
note
he
is
alluding
to
the
name
which
some
antiquaries
of
his
day
thought
to
have
been
the
earliest
name
of
the
city
derived
from
its
being
near
fluente
i
have
translated
the
word
in
the
text
literally
though
of
course
it
signifies
on
a
flowing
i
need
not
call
attention
to
the
apocryphal
nature
of
own
derivation
from
the
name
of
his
supposed
ancestor
iii
my
ancestors
dwelt
in
val
ambra
where
they
owned
large
estates
and
lived
like
little
lords
in
retirement
however
on
account
of
the
then
contending
factions
they
were
all
men
devoted
to
arms
and
of
notable
bravery
in
that
time
one
of
their
sons
the
younger
who
was
called
cristofano
roused
a
great
feud
with
certain
of
their
friends
and
neighbours
now
the
heads
of
the
families
on
both
sides
took
part
in
it
and
the
fire
kindled
seemed
to
them
so
threatening
that
their
houses
were
like
to
perish
utterly
the
elders
upon
this
consideration
in
concert
with
my
own
ancestors
removed
cristofano
and
the
other
youth
with
whom
the
quarrel
began
was
also
sent
away
they
sent
their
young
man
to
siena
our
folk
sent
cristofano
to
florence
and
there
they
bought
for
him
a
little
house
in
via
chiara
close
to
the
convent
of
orsola
and
they
also
purchased
for
him
some
very
good
property
near
the
ponte
a
rifredi
the
said
cristofano
took
wife
in
florence
and
had
sons
and
daughters
and
when
all
the
daughters
had
been
portioned
off
the
sons
after
their
death
divided
what
remained
the
house
in
via
chiara
with
some
other
trifles
fell
to
the
share
of
one
of
the
said
sons
who
had
the
name
of
andrea
he
also
took
wife
and
had
four
male
children
the
first
was
called
girolamo
the
second
bartolommeo
the
third
giovanni
who
was
afterwards
my
father
and
the
fourth
francesco
this
andrea
cellini
was
very
well
versed
in
architecture
as
it
was
then
practised
and
lived
by
it
as
his
trade
giovanni
who
was
my
father
paid
more
attention
to
it
than
any
of
the
other
brothers
and
since
vitruvius
says
amongst
other
things
that
one
who
wishes
to
practise
that
art
well
must
have
something
of
music
and
good
drawing
giovanni
when
he
had
mastered
drawing
began
to
turn
his
mind
to
music
and
together
with
the
theory
learned
to
play
most
excellently
on
the
viol
and
the
flute
and
being
a
person
of
studious
habits
he
left
his
home
but
seldom
they
had
for
neighbour
in
the
next
house
a
man
called
stefano
granacci
who
had
several
daughters
all
of
them
of
remarkable
beauty
as
it
pleased
god
giovanni
noticed
one
of
these
girls
who
was
named
elisabetta
and
she
found
such
favour
with
him
that
he
asked
her
in
marriage
the
fathers
of
both
of
them
being
well
acquainted
through
their
close
neighbourhood
it
was
easy
to
make
this
match
up
and
each
thought
that
he
had
very
well
arranged
his
affairs
first
of
all
the
two
good
old
men
agreed
upon
the
marriage
then
they
began
to
discuss
the
dowry
which
led
to
a
certain
amount
of
friendly
difference
for
andrea
said
to
stefano
son
giovanni
is
the
stoutest
youth
of
florence
and
of
all
italy
to
boot
and
if
i
had
wanted
earlier
to
have
him
married
i
could
have
procured
one
of
the
largest
dowries
which
folk
of
our
rank
get
in
florence
whereupon
stefano
answered
have
a
thousand
reasons
on
your
side
but
here
am
i
with
five
daughters
and
as
many
sons
and
when
my
reckoning
is
made
this
is
as
much
as
i
can
possibly
giovanni
who
had
been
listening
awhile
unseen
by
them
suddenly
broke
in
and
said
my
father
i
have
sought
and
loved
that
girl
and
not
their
money
ill
luck
to
those
who
seek
to
fill
their
pockets
by
the
dowry
of
their
wife
as
you
have
boasted
that
i
am
a
fellow
of
such
parts
do
you
not
think
that
i
shall
be
able
to
provide
for
my
wife
and
satisfy
her
needs
even
if
i
receive
something
short
of
the
portion
you
would
like
to
get
now
i
must
make
you
understand
that
the
woman
is
mine
and
you
may
take
the
dowry
for
at
this
andrea
cellini
who
was
a
man
of
rather
awkward
temper
grew
a
trifle
angry
but
after
a
few
days
giovanni
took
his
wife
and
never
asked
for
other
portion
with
her
they
enjoyed
their
youth
and
wedded
love
through
eighteen
years
always
greatly
desiring
to
be
blessed
with
children
at
the
end
of
this
time
wife
miscarried
of
two
boys
through
the
unskilfulness
of
the
doctors
later
on
she
was
again
with
child
and
gave
birth
to
a
girl
whom
they
called
cosa
after
the
mother
of
my
father
at
the
end
of
two
years
she
was
once
more
with
child
and
inasmuch
as
those
longings
to
which
pregnant
women
are
subject
and
to
which
they
pay
much
attention
were
now
exactly
the
same
as
those
of
her
former
pregnancy
they
made
their
minds
up
that
she
would
give
birth
to
a
female
as
before
and
agreed
to
call
the
child
reparata
after
the
mother
of
my
mother
it
happened
that
she
was
delivered
on
a
night
of
all
saints
following
the
at
four
precisely
in
the
year
the
midwife
who
knew
that
they
were
expecting
a
girl
after
she
had
washed
the
baby
and
wrapped
it
in
the
fairest
white
linen
came
softly
to
my
father
giovanni
and
said
am
bringing
you
a
fine
present
such
as
you
did
not
my
father
who
was
a
true
philosopher
was
walking
up
and
down
and
answered
god
gives
me
is
always
dear
to
me
and
when
he
opened
the
swaddling
clothes
he
saw
with
his
own
eyes
the
unexpected
male
child
joining
together
the
palms
of
his
old
hands
he
raised
them
with
his
eyes
to
god
and
said
i
thank
thee
with
my
whole
heart
this
gift
is
very
dear
to
me
let
him
be
all
the
persons
who
were
there
asked
him
joyfully
what
name
the
child
should
bear
giovanni
would
make
no
other
answer
than
him
be
and
so
they
resolved
and
this
name
was
given
me
at
holy
baptism
and
by
it
i
still
am
living
with
the
grace
of
god

iv
andrea
cellini
was
yet
alive
when
i
was
about
three
years
old
and
he
had
passed
his
hundredth
one
day
they
had
been
altering
a
certain
conduit
pertaining
to
a
cistern
and
there
issued
from
it
a
great
scorpion
unperceived
by
them
which
crept
down
from
the
cistern
to
the
ground
and
slank
away
beneath
a
bench
i
saw
it
and
ran
up
to
it
and
laid
my
hands
upon
it
it
was
so
big
that
when
i
had
it
in
my
little
hands
it
put
out
its
tail
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
thrust
forth
both
its
mouths
they
relate
that
i
ran
in
high
joy
to
my
grandfather
crying
out
grandpapa
at
my
pretty
little
when
he
recognised
that
the
creature
was
a
scorpion
he
was
on
the
point
of
falling
dead
for
the
great
fear
he
had
and
anxiety
about
me
he
coaxed
and
entreated
me
to
give
it
him
but
the
more
he
begged
the
tighter
i
clasped
it
crying
and
saying
i
would
not
give
it
to
any
one
my
father
who
was
also
in
the
house
ran
up
when
he
heard
my
screams
and
in
his
stupefaction
could
not
think
how
to
prevent
the
venomous
animal
from
killing
me
just
then
his
eyes
chanced
to
fall
upon
a
pair
of
scissors
and
so
while
soothing
and
caressing
me
he
cut
its
tail
and
mouths
off
afterwards
when
the
great
peril
had
been
thus
averted
he
took
the
occurrence
for
a
good
augury
when
i
was
about
five
years
old
my
father
happened
to
be
in
a
of
our
house
where
they
had
been
washing
and
where
a
good
fire
of
was
still
burning
he
had
a
viol
in
his
hand
and
was
playing
and
singing
alone
beside
the
fire
the
weather
was
very
cold
happening
to
look
into
the
fire
he
spied
in
the
middle
of
those
most
burning
flames
a
little
creature
like
a
lizard
which
was
sporting
in
the
core
of
the
intensest
coals
becoming
instantly
aware
of
what
the
thing
was
he
had
my
sister
and
me
called
and
pointing
it
out
to
us
children
gave
me
a
great
box
on
the
ears
which
caused
me
to
howl
and
weep
with
all
my
might
then
he
pacified
me
and
spoke
as
follows
dear
little
boy
i
am
not
striking
you
for
any
wrong
that
you
have
done
but
only
to
make
you
remember
that
that
lizard
which
you
see
in
the
fire
is
a
salamander
a
creature
which
has
never
been
seen
before
by
any
one
of
whom
we
have
credible
so
saying
he
kissed
me
and
gave
me
some
pieces
of
money
note
the
word
is
so
i
have
translated
it
by
but
cellini
clearly
meant
the
gaping
claws
of
the
scorpion
v
my
father
began
teaching
me
to
play
upon
the
flute
and
sing
by
note
by
notwithstanding
i
was
of
that
tender
age
when
little
children
are
wont
to
take
pastime
in
whistles
and
such
toys
i
had
an
inexpressible
dislike
for
it
and
played
and
sang
only
to
obey
him
my
father
in
those
times
fashioned
wonderful
organs
with
pipes
of
wood
spinets
the
fairest
and
most
excellent
which
then
could
be
seen
viols
and
lutes
and
harps
of
the
most
beautiful
and
perfect
construction
he
was
an
engineer
and
had
marvellous
skill
in
making
instruments
for
lowering
bridges
and
for
working
mills
and
other
machines
of
that
sort
in
ivory
he
was
the
first
who
wrought
really
well
but
after
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
woman
who
was
destined
to
become
my
what
brought
them
together
was
that
little
flute
to
which
indeed
he
paid
more
attention
than
was
was
entreated
by
the
fifers
of
the
signory
to
play
in
their
company
accordingly
he
did
so
for
some
time
to
amuse
himself
until
by
constant
importunity
they
induced
him
to
become
a
member
of
their
band
lorenzo
medici
and
pietro
his
son
who
had
a
great
liking
for
him
perceived
later
on
that
he
was
devoting
himself
wholly
to
the
fife
and
was
neglecting
his
fine
engineering
talent
and
his
beautiful
art
so
they
had
him
removed
from
that
post
my
father
took
this
very
ill
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
had
done
him
a
great
despite
yet
he
immediately
resumed
his
art
and
fashioned
a
mirror
about
a
cubit
in
diameter
out
of
bone
and
ivory
with
figures
and
foliage
of
great
finish
and
grand
design
the
mirror
was
in
the
form
of
a
wheel
in
the
middle
was
the
around
it
were
seven
circular
pieces
on
which
were
the
seven
virtues
carved
and
joined
of
ivory
and
black
bone
the
whole
mirror
together
with
the
virtues
was
placed
in
equilibrium
so
that
when
the
wheel
turned
all
the
virtues
moved
and
they
had
weights
at
their
feet
which
kept
them
upright
possessing
some
acquaintance
with
the
latin
tongue
he
put
a
legend
in
latin
round
his
to
this
the
wheel
of
fortune
turns
virtue
stands
firm
upon
her
feet
rota
sum
semper
quoquo
me
verto
stat
virtus
a
little
while
after
this
he
obtained
his
place
again
among
the
fifers
although
some
of
these
things
happened
before
i
was
born
my
familiarity
with
them
has
moved
me
to
set
them
down
here
in
those
days
the
musicians
of
the
signory
were
all
of
them
members
of
the
most
honourable
trades
and
some
of
them
belonged
to
the
greater
guilds
of
silk
and
wool
and
that
was
the
reason
why
my
father
did
not
disdain
to
follow
this
profession
and
his
chief
desire
with
regard
to
me
was
always
that
i
should
become
a
great
performer
on
the
flute
i
for
my
part
felt
never
more
discontented
than
when
he
chose
to
talk
to
me
about
this
scheme
and
to
tell
me
that
if
i
liked
he
discerned
in
me
such
aptitudes
that
i
might
become
the
best
man
in
the
world
note
the
medici
here
mentioned
were
lorenzo
the
magnificent
and
his
son
pietro
who
was
expelled
from
florence
in
the
year
he
never
returned
but
died
in
the
river
garigliano
in
note
in
the
middle
ages
the
burghers
of
florence
were
divided
into
industrial
guilds
called
the
greater
and
the
lesser
arts
the
former
took
precedence
of
the
latter
both
in
political
importance
and
in
social
esteem
vi
as
i
have
said
my
father
was
the
devoted
servant
and
attached
friend
of
the
house
of
medici
and
when
piero
was
banished
he
entrusted
him
with
many
affairs
of
the
greatest
possible
importance
afterwards
when
the
magnificent
piero
soderini
was
elected
and
my
father
continued
in
his
office
of
musician
soderini
perceiving
his
wonderful
talent
began
to
employ
him
in
many
matters
of
great
importance
as
an
engineer
so
long
as
soderini
remained
in
florence
he
showed
the
utmost
to
my
father
and
in
those
days
i
being
still
of
tender
age
my
father
had
me
carried
and
made
me
perform
upon
the
flute
i
used
to
play
treble
in
concert
with
the
musicians
of
the
palace
before
the
signory
following
my
notes
and
a
beadle
used
to
carry
me
upon
his
shoulders
the
gonfalonier
that
is
soderini
whom
i
have
already
mentioned
took
much
pleasure
in
making
me
chatter
and
gave
me
comfits
and
was
wont
to
say
to
my
father
giovanni
besides
music
teach
the
boy
those
other
arts
which
do
you
so
much
to
which
my
father
answered
do
not
wish
him
to
practise
any
art
but
playing
and
composing
for
in
this
profession
i
hope
to
make
him
the
greatest
man
of
the
world
if
god
prolongs
his
to
these
words
one
of
the
old
counsellors
made
answer
maestro
giovanni
do
what
the
gonfalonier
tells
you
for
why
should
he
never
become
anything
more
than
a
good
musician
thus
some
time
passed
until
the
medici
returned
when
they
arrived
the
cardinal
who
afterwards
became
pope
leo
received
my
father
very
kindly
during
their
exile
the
scutcheons
which
were
on
the
palace
of
the
medici
had
had
their
balls
erased
and
a
great
red
cross
painted
over
them
which
was
the
bearing
of
the
commune
accordingly
as
soon
as
they
returned
the
red
cross
was
scratched
out
and
on
the
scutcheon
the
red
balls
and
the
golden
field
were
painted
in
again
and
finished
with
great
beauty
my
father
who
possessed
a
simple
vein
of
poetry
instilled
in
him
by
nature
together
with
a
certain
touch
of
prophecy
which
was
doubtless
a
divine
gift
in
him
wrote
these
four
verses
under
the
said
arms
of
the
medici
when
they
were
uncovered
to
the
view
these
arms
which
have
so
long
from
sight
been
laid
beneath
the
holy
cross
that
symbol
meek
now
lift
their
glorious
glad
face
and
seek
with
sacred
cloak
to
be
arrayed
this
epigram
was
read
by
all
florence
a
few
days
afterwards
pope
julius
ii
died
the
cardinal
medici
went
to
rome
and
was
elected
pope
against
the
expectation
of
everybody
he
reigned
as
leo
x
that
generous
and
great
soul
my
father
sent
him
his
four
prophetic
verses
the
pope
sent
to
tell
him
to
come
to
rome
for
this
would
be
to
his
advantage
but
he
had
no
will
to
go
and
so
in
lieu
of
reward
his
place
in
the
palace
was
taken
from
him
by
jacopo
salviati
upon
that
election
as
gonfalonier
this
was
the
reason
why
i
commenced
goldsmith
after
which
i
spent
part
of
my
time
in
learning
that
art
and
part
in
playing
much
against
my
will
note
piero
soderini
was
elected
gonfalonier
of
the
florentine
republic
for
life
in
the
year
after
nine
years
of
government
he
was
banished
and
when
he
died
machiavelli
wrote
the
famous
sneering
epitaph
upon
him

here
salviati
married
a
daughter
of
lorenzo
medici
and
obtained
great
influence
in
florence
but
we
have
no
record
of
his
appointment
to
the
office
of
gonfalonier
vii
when
my
father
spoke
to
me
in
the
way
i
have
above
described
i
entreated
him
to
let
me
draw
a
certain
fixed
number
of
hours
in
the
day
all
the
rest
of
my
time
i
would
give
to
music
only
with
the
view
of
satisfying
his
desire
upon
this
he
said
to
me
then
you
take
no
pleasure
in
playing
to
which
i
answered
because
that
art
seemed
too
base
in
comparison
with
what
i
had
in
my
own
mind
my
good
father
driven
to
despair
by
this
fixed
idea
of
mine
placed
me
in
the
workshop
of
cavaliere
father
who
was
called
michel
agnolo
a
goldsmith
from
pinzi
di
monte
and
a
master
excellent
in
that
craft
he
had
no
distinction
of
birth
whatever
but
was
the
son
of
a
this
is
no
blame
to
bandinello
who
has
founded
the
honour
of
the
only
he
had
done
so
honestly
however
that
may
be
i
have
no
cause
now
to
talk
about
him
after
i
had
stayed
there
some
days
my
father
took
me
away
from
michel
agnolo
finding
himself
unable
to
live
without
having
me
always
under
his
eyes
accordingly
much
to
my
discontent
i
remained
at
music
till
i
reached
the
age
of
fifteen
if
i
were
to
describe
all
the
wonderful
things
that
happened
to
me
up
to
that
time
and
all
the
great
dangers
to
my
own
life
which
i
ran
i
should
astound
my
readers
but
in
order
to
avoid
prolixity
and
having
very
much
to
relate
i
will
omit
these
incidents
when
i
reached
the
age
of
fifteen
i
put
myself
against
my
will
to
the
trade
with
a
man
called
antonio
son
of
sandro
known
commonly
as
marcone
the
goldsmith
he
was
a
most
excellent
craftsman
and
a
very
good
fellow
to
boot
and
frank
in
all
his
ways
my
father
would
not
let
him
give
me
wages
like
the
other
apprentices
for
having
taken
up
the
study
of
this
art
to
please
myself
he
wished
me
to
indulge
my
whim
for
drawing
to
the
full
i
did
so
willingly
enough
and
that
honest
master
of
mine
took
marvellous
delight
in
my
performances
he
had
an
only
son
a
bastard
to
whom
he
often
gave
his
orders
in
order
to
spare
me
my
liking
for
the
art
was
so
great
or
i
may
truly
say
my
natural
bias
both
one
and
the
other
that
in
a
few
months
i
caught
up
the
good
nay
the
best
young
craftsmen
in
our
business
and
began
to
reap
the
fruits
of
my
labours
i
did
not
however
neglect
to
gratify
my
good
father
from
time
to
time
by
playing
on
the
flute
or
cornet
each
time
he
heard
me
i
used
to
make
his
tears
fall
accompanied
with
sighs
of
satisfaction
my
filial
piety
often
made
me
give
him
that
contentment
and
induce
me
to
pretend
that
i
enjoyed
the
music
too
note
baccio
bandinello
the
sculptor
and
a
great
rival
of
as
will
appear
in
the
ensuing
pages
was
born
in
and
received
the
honour
of
knighthood
from
clement
vii
and
charles
posterity
has
confirmed
opinion
of
bandinello
as
an
artist
for
his
works
are
coarse
pretentious
and
incapable
of
giving
pleasure
to
any
person
of
refined
intelligence
viii
at
that
time
i
had
a
brother
younger
by
two
years
a
youth
of
extreme
boldness
and
fierce
temper
he
afterwards
became
one
of
the
great
soldiers
in
the
school
of
that
marvellous
general
giovannino
medici
father
of
duke
cosimo
the
boy
was
about
fourteen
and
i
two
years
older
one
sunday
evening
just
before
nightfall
he
happened
to
find
himself
between
the
gate
san
gallo
and
the
porta
a
pinti
in
this
quarter
he
came
to
duel
with
a
young
fellow
of
twenty
or
thereabouts
they
both
had
swords
and
my
brother
dealt
so
valiantly
that
after
having
badly
wounded
him
he
was
upon
the
point
of
following
up
his
advantage
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
people
present
among
whom
were
many
of
the
kinsfolk
seeing
that
the
thing
was
going
ill
for
their
own
man
they
put
hand
to
their
slings
a
stone
from
one
of
which
hit
my
poor
brother
in
the
head
he
fell
to
the
ground
at
once
in
a
dead
faint
it
so
chanced
that
i
had
been
upon
the
spot
alone
and
without
arms
and
i
had
done
my
best
to
get
my
brother
out
of
the
fray
by
calling
to
him
off
you
have
done
meanwhile
as
luck
would
have
it
he
fell
as
i
have
said
half
dead
to
earth
i
ran
up
at
once
seized
his
sword
and
stood
in
front
of
him
bearing
the
brunt
of
several
rapiers
and
a
shower
of
stones
i
never
left
his
side
until
some
brave
soldiers
came
from
the
gate
san
gallo
and
rescued
me
from
the
raging
crowd
they
marvelled
much
the
while
to
find
such
valour
in
so
young
a
boy
then
i
carried
my
brother
home
for
dead
and
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
he
came
to
himself
again
when
he
was
cured
the
eight
who
had
already
condemned
out
adversaries
and
banished
them
for
a
term
of
years
sent
us
also
into
exile
for
six
months
at
a
distance
of
ten
miles
from
florence
i
said
to
my
brother
along
with
me
and
so
we
took
leave
of
our
poor
father
and
instead
of
giving
us
money
for
he
had
none
he
bestowed
on
us
his
blessing
i
went
to
siena
wishing
to
look
up
a
certain
worthy
man
called
maestro
francesco
castoro
on
another
occasion
when
i
had
run
away
from
my
father
i
went
to
this
good
man
and
stayed
some
time
with
him
working
at
the
trade
until
my
father
sent
for
me
back
francesco
when
i
reached
him
recognised
me
at
once
and
gave
me
work
to
do
while
thus
occupied
he
placed
a
house
at
my
disposal
for
the
whole
time
of
my
sojourn
in
siena
into
this
i
moved
together
with
my
brother
and
applied
myself
to
labour
for
the
space
of
several
months
my
brother
had
acquired
the
rudiments
of
latin
but
was
still
so
young
that
he
could
not
yet
relish
the
taste
of
virtuous
employment
but
passed
his
time
in
dissipation
note
cellini
refers
to
the
famous
giovanni
delle
bande
nere
who
was
killed
in
an
engagement
in
lombardy
in
november
by
the
imperialist
troops
marching
to
the
sack
of
rome
his
son
cosimo
after
the
murder
of
duke
alessandro
established
the
second
medicean
dynasty
in
florence
note
the
eight
or
gli
otto
were
a
magistracy
in
florence
with
cognizance
of
matters
affecting
the
internal
peace
of
the
city
ix
the
cardinal
medici
who
afterwards
became
pope
clement
had
us
recalled
to
florence
at
the
entreaty
of
my
father
a
certain
pupil
of
my
moved
by
his
own
bad
nature
suggested
to
the
cardinal
that
he
ought
to
send
me
to
bologna
in
order
to
learn
to
play
well
from
a
great
master
there
the
name
of
this
master
was
antonio
and
he
was
in
truth
a
worthy
man
in
the
art
the
cardinal
said
to
my
father
that
if
he
sent
me
there
he
would
give
me
letters
of
recommendation
and
support
my
father
dying
with
joy
at
such
an
opportunity
sent
me
off
and
i
being
eager
to
see
the
world
went
with
good
grace
when
i
reached
bologna
i
put
myself
under
a
certain
maestro
ercole
del
piffero
and
began
to
earn
something
by
my
trade
in
the
meantime
i
used
to
go
every
day
to
take
my
music
lesson
and
in
a
few
weeks
made
considerable
progress
in
that
accursed
art
however
i
made
still
greater
in
my
trade
of
goldsmith
for
the
cardinal
having
given
me
no
assistance
i
went
to
live
with
a
bolognese
illuminator
who
was
called
scipione
cavalletti
his
house
was
in
the
street
of
our
lady
del
baraccan
and
while
there
i
devoted
myself
to
drawing
and
working
for
one
graziadio
a
jew
with
whom
i
earned
considerably
at
the
end
of
six
months
i
returned
to
florence
where
that
fellow
pierino
who
had
been
my
pupil
was
greatly
mortified
by
my
return
to
please
my
father
i
went
to
his
house
and
played
the
cornet
and
the
flute
with
one
of
his
brothers
who
was
named
girolamo
several
years
younger
than
the
said
piero
a
very
worthy
young
man
and
quite
the
contrary
of
his
brother
on
one
of
those
days
my
father
came
to
house
to
hear
us
play
and
in
ecstasy
at
my
performance
exclaimed
shall
yet
make
you
a
marvellous
musician
against
the
will
of
all
or
any
one
who
may
desire
to
prevent
to
this
piero
answered
and
spoke
the
truth
benvenuto
will
get
much
more
honour
and
profit
if
he
devotes
himself
to
the
goldsmiths
trade
than
to
this
these
words
made
my
father
angry
seeing
that
i
too
had
the
same
opinion
as
piero
that
he
flew
into
a
rage
and
cried
out
at
him
did
i
know
that
it
was
you
you
who
put
obstacles
in
the
way
of
my
cherished
wish
you
are
the
man
who
had
me
ousted
from
my
place
at
the
palace
paying
me
back
with
that
black
ingratitude
which
is
the
usual
recompense
of
great
benefits
i
got
you
promoted
and
you
have
got
me
cashiered
i
taught
you
to
play
with
all
the
little
art
you
have
and
you
are
preventing
my
son
from
obeying
me
but
bear
in
mind
these
words
of
prophecy
not
years
or
months
i
say
but
only
a
few
weeks
will
pass
before
this
dirty
ingratitude
of
yours
shall
plunge
you
into
to
these
words
answered
pierino
and
said
giovanni
the
majority
of
men
when
they
grow
old
go
mad
at
the
same
time
and
this
has
happened
to
you
i
am
not
astonished
at
it
because
most
liberally
have
you
squandered
all
your
property
without
reflecting
that
your
children
had
need
of
it
i
mind
to
do
just
the
opposite
and
to
leave
my
children
so
much
that
they
shall
be
able
to
succour
to
this
my
father
answered
bad
tree
ever
bore
good
fruit
quite
the
contrary
and
i
tell
you
further
that
you
are
bad
and
that
your
children
will
be
mad
and
paupers
and
will
cringe
for
alms
to
my
virtuous
and
wealthy
thereupon
we
left
the
house
muttering
words
of
anger
on
both
sides
i
had
taken
my
part
and
when
we
stepped
into
the
street
together
i
told
him
i
was
quite
ready
to
take
vengeance
for
the
insults
heaped
on
him
by
that
scoundrel
provided
he
permit
me
to
give
myself
up
to
the
art
of
design
he
answered
dear
son
i
too
in
my
time
was
a
good
draughtsman
but
for
recreation
after
such
stupendous
labours
and
for
the
love
of
me
who
am
your
father
who
begat
you
and
brought
you
up
and
implanted
so
many
honourable
talents
in
you
for
the
sake
of
recreation
i
say
will
not
you
promise
sometimes
to
take
in
hand
your
flute
and
that
seductive
cornet
and
to
play
upon
them
to
your
content
inviting
the
delight
of
music
i
promised
i
would
do
so
and
very
willingly
for
his
sake
then
my
good
father
said
that
such
excellent
parts
as
i
possessed
would
be
the
greatest
vengeance
i
could
take
for
the
insults
of
his
enemies
not
a
whole
month
had
been
completed
after
this
scene
before
the
man
pierino
happened
to
be
building
a
vault
in
a
house
of
his
which
he
had
in
the
via
dello
studio
and
being
one
day
in
a
room
above
the
vault
which
he
was
making
together
with
much
company
around
him
he
fell
to
talking
about
his
old
master
my
father
while
repeating
the
words
which
he
had
said
to
him
concerning
his
ruin
no
sooner
had
they
escaped
his
lips
than
the
floor
where
he
was
standing
either
because
the
vault
had
been
badly
built
or
rather
through
the
sheer
mightiness
of
god
who
does
not
always
pay
on
saturday
suddenly
gave
way
some
of
the
stones
and
bricks
of
the
vault
which
fell
with
him
broke
both
his
legs
the
friends
who
were
with
him
remaining
on
the
border
of
the
broken
vault
took
no
harm
but
were
astounded
and
full
of
wonder
especially
because
of
the
prophecy
which
he
had
just
contemptuously
repeated
to
them
when
my
father
heard
of
this
he
took
his
sword
and
went
to
see
the
man
there
in
the
presence
of
his
father
who
was
called
niccolaio
da
volterra
a
trumpeter
of
the
signory
he
said
piero
my
dear
pupil
i
am
sorely
grieved
at
your
mischance
but
if
you
remember
it
was
only
a
short
time
ago
that
i
warned
you
of
it
and
as
much
as
i
then
said
will
come
to
happen
between
your
children
and
shortly
afterwards
the
ungrateful
piero
died
of
that
illness
he
left
a
wife
of
bad
character
and
one
son
who
after
the
lapse
of
some
years
came
to
me
to
beg
for
alms
in
rome
i
gave
him
something
as
well
because
it
is
my
nature
to
be
charitable
as
also
because
i
recalled
with
tears
the
happy
state
which
pierino
held
when
my
father
spake
those
words
of
prophecy
namely
that
children
should
live
to
crave
succour
from
his
own
virtuous
sons
of
this
perhaps
enough
is
now
said
but
let
none
ever
laugh
at
the
prognostications
of
any
worthy
man
whom
he
has
wrongfully
insulted
because
it
is
not
he
who
speaks
nay
but
the
very
voice
of
god
through
him
note
this
cardinal
and
pope
was
giulio
a
natural
son
of
giuliano
lorenzo
brother
who
had
been
killed
in
the
pazzi
conspiracy
year
giulio
lived
to
become
pope
clement
to
suffer
the
sack
of
rome
in
and
to
make
the
concordat
with
charles
at
bologna
in
which
settled
for
three
centuries
the
destiny
of
italy
we
shall
hear
much
more
of
him
from
cellini
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
x
all
this
while
i
worked
as
a
goldsmith
and
was
able
to
assist
my
good
father
his
other
son
my
brother
cecchino
had
as
i
said
before
been
instructed
in
the
rudiments
of
latin
letters
it
was
our
wish
to
make
me
the
elder
a
great
musician
and
composer
and
him
the
younger
a
great
and
learned
jurist
he
could
not
however
put
force
upon
the
inclinations
of
our
nature
which
directed
me
to
the
arts
of
design
and
my
brother
who
had
a
fine
and
graceful
person
to
the
profession
of
arms
cecchino
being
still
quite
a
lad
was
returning
from
his
first
lesson
in
the
school
of
the
stupendous
giovannino
medici
on
the
day
when
he
reached
home
i
happened
to
be
absent
and
he
being
in
want
of
proper
clothes
sought
out
our
sisters
who
unknown
to
my
father
gave
him
a
cloak
and
doublet
of
mine
both
new
and
of
good
quality
i
ought
to
say
that
beside
the
aid
i
gave
my
father
and
my
excellent
and
honest
sisters
i
had
bought
those
handsome
clothes
out
of
my
own
savings
when
i
found
i
had
been
cheated
and
my
clothes
taken
from
me
and
my
brother
from
whom
i
should
have
recovered
them
was
gone
i
asked
my
father
why
he
suffered
so
great
a
wrong
to
be
done
me
seeing
that
i
was
always
ready
to
assist
him
he
replied
that
i
was
his
good
son
but
that
the
other
whom
he
thought
to
have
lost
had
been
found
again
also
that
it
was
a
duty
nay
a
precept
from
god
himself
that
he
who
hath
should
give
to
him
who
hath
not
and
that
for
his
sake
i
ought
to
bear
this
injustice
for
god
would
increase
me
in
all
good
things
i
like
a
youth
without
experience
retorted
on
my
poor
afflicted
parent
and
taking
the
miserable
remnants
of
my
clothes
and
money
went
toward
a
gate
of
the
city
as
i
did
not
know
which
gate
would
start
me
on
the
road
to
rome
i
arrived
at
lucca
and
from
lucca
reached
pisa
when
i
came
to
pisa
i
was
about
sixteen
years
of
age
at
the
time
i
stopped
near
the
middle
bridge
by
what
is
called
the
at
the
shop
of
a
goldsmith
and
began
attentively
to
watch
what
the
master
was
about
he
asked
me
who
i
was
and
what
was
my
profession
i
told
him
that
i
worked
a
little
in
the
same
trade
as
his
own
this
worthy
man
bade
me
come
into
his
shop
and
at
once
gave
me
work
to
do
and
spoke
as
follows
good
appearance
makes
me
believe
you
are
a
decent
honest
then
he
told
me
out
gold
silver
and
gems
and
when
the
first
work
was
finished
he
took
me
in
the
evening
to
his
house
where
he
dwelt
respectably
with
his
handsome
wife
and
children
thinking
of
the
grief
which
my
good
father
might
be
feeling
for
me
i
wrote
him
that
i
was
sojourning
with
a
very
excellent
and
honest
man
called
maestro
ulivieri
della
chiostra
and
was
working
with
him
at
many
good
things
of
beauty
and
importance
i
bade
him
be
of
good
cheer
for
that
i
was
bent
on
learning
and
hoped
by
my
acquirements
to
bring
him
back
both
profit
and
honour
before
long
my
good
father
answered
the
letter
at
once
in
words
like
these
son
the
love
i
bear
you
is
so
great
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
honour
of
our
family
which
above
all
things
i
regard
i
should
immediately
have
set
off
for
you
for
indeed
it
seems
like
being
without
the
light
of
my
eyes
when
i
do
not
see
you
daily
as
i
used
to
do
i
will
make
it
my
business
to
complete
the
training
of
my
household
up
to
virtuous
honesty
do
you
make
it
yours
to
acquire
excellence
in
your
art
and
i
only
wish
you
to
remember
these
four
simple
words
obey
them
and
never
let
them
escape
your
memory
in
whatever
house
you
be
steal
not
and
live
note
the
or
pietra
del
pesce
was
the
market
on
the
quay
where
the
fish
brought
from
the
sea
up
the
arno
to
pisa
used
to
be
sold
xi
this
letter
fell
into
the
hands
of
my
master
ulivieri
and
he
read
it
unknown
to
me
afterwards
he
avowed
that
he
had
read
it
and
added
then
my
benvenuto
your
good
looks
did
not
deceive
me
as
a
letter
from
your
father
which
has
come
into
my
hands
gives
me
assurance
which
proves
him
to
be
a
man
of
notable
honesty
and
worth
consider
yourself
then
to
be
at
home
here
and
as
though
in
your
own
while
i
stayed
at
pisa
i
went
to
see
the
campo
santo
and
there
i
found
many
beautiful
fragments
of
antiquity
that
is
to
say
marble
sarcophagi
in
other
parts
of
pisa
also
i
saw
many
antique
objects
which
i
diligently
studied
whenever
i
had
days
or
hours
free
from
the
labour
of
the
workshop
my
master
who
took
pleasure
in
coming
to
visit
me
in
the
little
room
which
he
had
allotted
me
observing
that
i
spent
all
my
time
in
studious
occupations
began
to
love
me
like
a
father
i
made
great
progress
in
the
one
year
that
i
stayed
there
and
completed
several
fine
and
valuable
things
in
gold
and
silver
which
inspired
me
with
a
resolute
ambition
to
advance
in
my
art
my
father
in
the
meanwhile
kept
writing
piteous
entreaties
that
i
should
return
to
him
and
in
every
letter
bade
me
not
to
lose
the
music
he
had
taught
me
with
such
trouble
on
this
i
suddenly
gave
up
all
wish
to
go
back
to
him
so
much
did
i
hate
that
accursed
music
and
i
felt
as
though
of
a
truth
i
were
in
paradise
the
whole
year
i
stayed
at
pisa
where
i
never
played
the
flute
at
the
end
of
the
year
my
master
ulivieri
had
occasion
to
go
to
florence
in
order
to
sell
certain
gold
and
silver
sweepings
which
he
had
and
inasmuch
as
the
bad
air
of
pisa
had
given
me
a
touch
of
fever
i
went
with
the
fever
hanging
still
about
me
in
my
company
back
to
florence
there
my
father
received
him
most
affectionately
and
lovingly
prayed
him
unknown
by
me
not
to
insist
on
taking
me
again
to
pisa
i
was
ill
about
two
months
during
which
time
my
father
had
me
most
kindly
treated
and
cured
always
repeating
that
it
seemed
to
him
a
thousand
years
till
i
got
well
again
in
order
that
he
might
hear
me
play
a
little
but
when
he
talked
to
me
of
music
with
his
fingers
on
my
pulse
seeing
he
had
some
acquaintance
with
medicine
and
latin
learning
he
felt
it
change
so
much
if
he
approached
that
topic
that
he
was
often
dismayed
and
left
my
side
in
tears
when
i
perceived
how
greatly
he
was
disappointed
i
bade
one
of
my
sisters
bring
me
a
flute
for
though
the
fever
never
left
me
that
instrument
is
so
easy
that
it
did
not
hurt
me
to
play
upon
it
and
i
used
it
with
such
dexterity
of
hand
and
tongue
that
my
father
coming
suddenly
upon
me
blessed
me
a
thousand
times
exclaiming
that
while
i
was
away
from
him
i
had
made
great
progress
as
he
thought
and
he
begged
me
to
go
forwards
and
not
to
sacrifice
so
fine
an
accomplishment
note
i
have
translated
by
it
means
all
refuse
of
the
precious
metals
left
in
trays
xii
when
i
had
recovered
my
health
i
returned
to
my
old
friend
marcone
the
worthy
goldsmith
who
put
me
in
the
way
of
earning
money
with
which
i
helped
my
father
and
our
household
about
that
time
there
came
to
florence
a
sculptor
named
piero
torrigiani
he
arrived
from
england
where
he
had
resided
many
years
and
being
intimate
with
my
master
he
daily
visited
his
house
and
when
he
saw
my
drawings
and
the
things
which
i
was
making
he
said
have
come
to
florence
to
enlist
as
many
young
men
as
i
can
for
i
have
undertaken
to
execute
a
great
work
of
my
king
and
want
some
of
my
own
florentines
to
help
me
now
your
method
of
working
and
your
designs
are
worthy
rather
of
a
sculptor
than
a
goldsmith
and
since
i
have
to
turn
out
a
great
piece
of
bronze
i
will
at
the
same
time
turn
you
into
a
rich
and
able
this
man
had
a
splendid
person
and
a
most
arrogant
spirit
with
the
air
of
a
great
soldier
more
than
a
sculptor
especially
in
regard
to
his
vehement
gestures
and
his
resonant
voice
together
with
a
habit
he
had
of
knitting
his
brows
enough
to
frighten
any
man
of
courage
he
kept
talking
every
day
about
his
gallant
feats
among
those
beasts
of
englishmen
in
course
of
conversation
he
happened
to
mention
michel
agnolo
buonarroti
led
thereto
by
a
drawing
i
had
made
from
a
cartoon
of
that
divinest
painter
this
cartoon
was
the
first
masterpiece
which
michel
agnolo
exhibited
in
proof
of
his
stupendous
talents
he
produced
it
in
competition
with
another
painter
lionardo
da
vinci
who
also
made
a
cartoon
and
both
were
intended
for
the
in
the
palace
of
the
signory
they
represented
the
taking
of
pisa
by
the
florentines
and
our
admirable
lionardo
had
chosen
to
depict
a
battle
of
horses
with
the
capture
of
some
standards
in
as
divine
a
style
as
could
possibly
be
imagined
michel
agnolo
in
his
cartoon
portrayed
a
number
of
who
the
season
being
summer
had
gone
to
bathe
in
arno
he
drew
them
at
the
very
moment
the
alarm
is
sounded
and
the
men
all
naked
run
to
arms
so
splendid
in
their
action
that
nothing
survives
of
ancient
or
of
modern
art
which
touches
the
same
lofty
point
of
excellence
and
as
i
have
already
said
the
design
of
the
great
lionardo
was
itself
most
admirably
beautiful
these
two
cartoons
stood
one
in
the
palace
of
the
medici
the
other
in
the
hall
of
the
pope
so
long
as
they
remained
intact
they
were
the
school
of
the
world
though
the
divine
michel
agnolo
in
later
life
finished
that
great
chapel
of
pope
julius
he
never
rose
to
the
same
pitch
of
power
his
genius
never
afterwards
attained
to
the
force
of
those
first
studies
note
torrigiani
worked
in
fact
for
henry
and
his
monument
to
henry
vii
still
exists
in
the
lady
chapel
of
westminster
abbey
from
england
he
went
to
spain
where
he
modelled
a
statue
of
the
virgin
for
a
great
nobleman
not
receiving
the
pay
he
expected
he
broke
his
work
to
pieces
for
which
act
of
sacrilege
the
inquisition
sent
him
to
prison
where
he
starved
himself
to
death
in
such
at
least
is
the
legend
of
his
end
note
the
cartoons
to
which
cellini
here
alludes
were
made
by
michel
angelo
and
lionardo
for
the
decoration
of
the
sala
del
gran
consiglio
in
the
palazzo
vecchio
at
florence
only
the
shadows
of
them
remain
to
this
day
a
part
of
michel
engraved
by
schiavonetti
and
a
transcript
by
rubens
from
called
the
battle
of
the
standard
note
the
sistine
chapel
in
the
vatican
xiii
now
let
us
return
to
piero
torrigiani
who
with
my
drawing
in
his
hand
spoke
as
follows
buonarroti
and
i
used
when
we
were
boys
to
go
into
the
church
of
the
carmine
to
learn
drawing
from
the
chapel
of
masaccio
it
was
habit
to
banter
all
who
were
drawing
there
and
one
day
among
others
when
he
was
annoying
me
i
got
more
angry
than
usual
and
clenching
my
fist
gave
him
such
a
blow
on
the
nose
that
i
felt
bone
and
cartilage
go
down
like
biscuit
beneath
my
knuckles
and
this
mark
of
mine
he
will
carry
with
him
to
the
these
words
begat
in
me
such
hatred
of
the
man
since
i
was
always
gazing
at
the
masterpieces
of
the
divine
michel
agnolo
that
although
i
felt
a
wish
to
go
with
him
to
england
i
now
could
never
bear
the
sight
of
him
all
the
while
i
was
at
florence
i
studied
the
noble
manner
of
michel
agnolo
and
from
this
i
have
never
deviated
about
that
time
i
contracted
a
close
and
familiar
friendship
with
an
amiable
lad
of
my
own
age
who
was
also
in
the
trade
he
was
called
francesco
son
of
filippo
and
grandson
of
fra
lippo
lippi
that
most
excellent
painter
through
intercourse
together
such
love
grew
up
between
us
that
day
or
night
we
never
stayed
apart
the
house
where
he
lived
was
still
full
of
the
fine
studies
which
his
father
had
made
bound
up
in
several
books
of
drawings
by
his
hand
and
taken
from
the
best
antiquities
of
rome
the
sight
of
these
things
filled
me
with
passionate
enthusiasm
and
for
two
years
or
thereabouts
we
lived
in
intimacy
at
that
time
i
fashioned
a
silver
of
the
size
of
a
little
hand
it
was
intended
for
the
clasp
to
a
belt
for
they
were
then
worn
as
large
as
that
i
carved
on
it
a
knot
of
leaves
in
the
antique
style
with
figures
of
children
and
other
masks
of
great
beauty
this
piece
i
made
in
the
workshop
of
one
francesco
salimbene
and
on
its
being
exhibited
to
the
trade
the
goldsmiths
praised
me
as
the
best
young
craftsman
of
their
art
there
was
one
giovan
battista
surnamed
il
tasso
a
precisely
of
my
own
age
who
one
day
said
to
me
that
if
i
was
willing
to
go
to
rome
he
should
be
glad
to
join
me
now
we
had
this
conversation
together
immediately
after
dinner
and
i
being
angry
with
my
father
for
the
same
old
reason
of
the
music
said
to
tasso
are
a
fellow
of
words
not
he
answered
too
have
come
to
anger
with
my
mother
and
if
i
had
cash
enough
to
take
me
to
rome
i
would
not
turn
back
to
lock
the
door
of
that
wretched
little
workshop
i
call
to
these
words
i
replied
that
if
that
was
all
that
kept
him
in
florence
i
had
money
enough
in
my
pockets
to
bring
us
both
to
rome
talking
thus
and
walking
onwards
we
found
ourselves
at
the
gate
san
piero
gattolini
without
noticing
that
we
had
got
there
whereupon
i
said
tasso
this
is
doing
that
we
have
reached
this
gate
without
either
you
or
me
noticing
that
we
were
there
and
now
that
i
am
here
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
finished
half
the
and
so
being
of
one
accord
we
pursued
our
way
together
saying
what
will
our
old
folks
say
this
evening
we
then
made
an
agreement
not
to
think
more
about
them
till
we
reached
rome
so
we
tied
our
aprons
behind
our
backs
and
trudged
almost
in
silence
to
siena
when
we
arrived
at
siena
tasso
said
for
he
had
hurt
his
feet
that
he
would
not
go
farther
and
asked
me
to
lend
him
money
to
get
back
i
made
answer
should
not
have
enough
left
to
go
forward
you
ought
indeed
to
have
thought
of
this
on
leaving
florence
and
if
it
is
because
of
your
feet
that
you
shirk
the
journey
we
will
find
a
return
horse
for
rome
which
will
deprive
you
of
the
accordingly
i
hired
a
horse
and
seeing
that
he
did
not
answer
i
took
my
way
toward
the
gate
of
rome
when
he
knew
that
i
was
firmly
resolved
to
go
muttering
between
his
teeth
and
limping
as
well
as
he
could
he
came
on
behind
me
very
slowly
and
at
a
great
distance
on
reaching
the
gate
i
felt
pity
for
my
comrade
and
waited
for
him
and
took
him
on
the
crupper
saying
would
our
friends
speak
of
us
if
having
left
for
rome
we
had
not
pluck
to
get
beyond
siena
then
the
good
tasso
said
i
spoke
the
truth
and
as
he
was
a
pleasant
fellow
he
began
to
laugh
and
sing
and
in
this
way
always
singing
and
laughing
we
travelled
the
whole
way
to
rome
i
had
just
nineteen
years
then
and
so
had
the
century
when
we
reached
rome
i
put
myself
under
a
master
who
was
known
as
il
firenzuola
his
name
was
giovanni
and
he
came
from
firenzuola
in
lombardy
a
most
able
craftsman
in
large
vases
and
big
plate
of
that
kind
i
showed
him
part
of
the
model
for
the
clasp
which
i
had
made
in
florence
at
it
pleased
him
exceedingly
and
turning
to
one
of
his
journeymen
a
florentine
called
giannotto
giannotti
who
had
been
several
years
with
him
he
spoke
as
follows
fellow
is
one
of
the
florentines
who
know
something
and
you
are
one
of
those
who
know
then
i
recognised
the
man
and
turned
to
speak
with
him
for
before
he
went
to
rome
we
often
went
to
draw
together
and
had
been
very
intimate
comrades
he
was
so
put
out
by
the
words
his
master
flung
at
him
that
he
said
he
did
not
recognise
me
or
know
who
i
was
whereupon
i
got
angry
and
cried
out
giannotto
you
who
were
once
my
have
we
not
been
together
in
such
and
such
places
and
drawn
and
ate
and
drunk
and
slept
in
company
at
your
house
in
the
country
i
want
you
to
bear
witness
on
my
behalf
to
this
worthy
man
your
master
because
i
hope
my
hands
are
such
that
without
aid
from
you
they
will
declare
what
sort
of
a
fellow
i
note
the
chapel
of
the
carmine
painted
in
fresco
by
masaccio
and
some
other
artist
possibly
filippino
lippi
is
still
the
most
important
monument
of
florentine
art
surviving
from
the
period
preceding
raphael
note
the
profile
portraits
of
michel
angelo
buonarroti
confirm
this
story
they
show
the
bridge
of
his
nose
bent
in
an
angle
as
though
it
had
been
broken
note
fra
filippo
lippi
was
a
carmelite
monk
whose
frescoes
at
prato
and
spoleta
and
in
florence
and
elsewhere
are
among
the
most
genial
works
of
the
renaissance
vasari

his
with
lucrezia
buti
and
robert
browning
has
drawn
a
clever
portrait
of
him
in
his
and
his
son
filippo
or
filippino
was
also
an
able
painter
some
of
whose
best
work
survives
in
the
strozzi
chapel
of
maria
novella
at
florence
and
in
the
church
of
maria
sopra
minerva
at
rome
note
tasso
was
an
able
artist
mentioned
both
by
vasari
and
pietro
aretino
he
stood
high
in
the
favour
of
duke
cosimo
medici
who
took
his
opinion
on
the
work
of
other
craftsmen
xiv
when
i
had
thus
spoken
firenzuola
who
was
a
man
of
hot
spirit
and
brave
turned
to
giannotto
and
said
to
him
vile
rascal
you
ashamed
to
treat
a
man
who
has
been
so
intimate
a
comrade
with
you
in
this
way
and
with
the
same
movement
of
quick
feeling
he
faced
round
and
said
to
me
to
my
workshop
and
do
as
you
have
promised
let
your
hands
declare
what
man
you
he
gave
me
a
very
fine
piece
of
silver
plate
to
work
on
for
a
cardinal
it
was
a
little
oblong
box
copied
from
the
porphyry
sarcophagus
before
the
door
of
the
rotonda
beside
what
i
copied
i
enriched
it
with
so
many
elegant
masks
of
my
invention
that
my
master
went
about
showing
it
through
the
art
and
boasting
that
so
good
a
piece
of
work
had
been
turned
out
from
his
shop
it
was
about
half
a
cubit
in
size
and
was
so
constructed
as
to
serve
for
a
at
table
this
was
the
first
earning
that
i
touched
at
rome
and
part
of
it
i
sent
to
assist
my
good
father
the
rest
i
kept
for
my
own
use
living
upon
it
while
i
went
about
studying
the
antiquities
of
rome
until
my
money
failed
and
i
had
to
return
to
the
shop
for
work
battista
del
tasso
my
comrade
did
not
stay
long
in
rome
but
went
back
to
florence
after
undertaking
some
new
commissions
i
took
it
into
my
head
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
them
to
change
my
master
i
had
indeed
been
worried
into
doing
so
by
a
certain
milanese
called
pagolo
arsago
my
first
master
firenzuola
had
a
great
quarrel
about
this
with
arsago
and
abused
him
in
my
presence
whereupon
i
took
up
speech
in
defence
of
my
new
master
i
said
that
i
was
born
free
and
free
i
meant
to
live
and
that
there
was
no
reason
to
complain
of
him
far
less
of
me
since
some
few
crowns
of
wages
were
still
due
to
me
also
that
i
chose
to
go
like
a
free
journeyman
where
it
pleased
me
knowing
i
did
wrong
to
no
man
my
new
master
then
put
in
with
his
excuses
saying
that
he
had
not
asked
me
to
come
and
that
i
should
gratify
him
by
returning
with
firenzuola
to
this
i
replied
that
i
was
not
aware
of
wronging
the
latter
in
any
way
and
as
i
had
completed
his
commissions
i
chose
to
be
my
own
master
and
not
the
man
of
others
and
that
he
who
wanted
me
must
beg
me
of
myself
firenzuola
cried
intend
to
beg
you
of
yourself
i
have
done
with
you
show
yourself
again
upon
my
i
reminded
him
of
the
money
he
owed
me
he
laughed
me
in
the
face
on
which
i
said
that
if
i
knew
how
to
use
my
tools
in
handicraft
as
well
as
he
had
seen
i
could
be
quite
as
clever
with
my
sword
in
claiming
the
just
payment
of
my
labour
while
we
were
exchanging
these
words
an
old
man
happened
to
come
up
called
maestro
antonio
of
san
marino
he
was
the
chief
among
the
roman
goldsmiths
and
had
been
master
hearing
what
i
had
to
say
which
i
took
good
care
that
he
should
understand
he
immediately
espoused
my
cause
and
bade
firenzuola
pay
me
the
dispute
waxed
warm
because
firenzuola
was
an
admirable
swordsman
far
better
than
he
was
a
goldsmith
yet
reason
made
itself
heard
and
i
backed
my
cause
with
the
same
spirit
till
i
got
myself
paid
in
course
of
time
firenzuola
and
i
became
friends
and
at
his
request
i
stood
godfather
to
one
of
his
children
note
use
of
the
word
for

of

as
used

english
writers

in

century

the
italian
is
which
might
be
also
translated

xv
i
went
on
working
with
pagolo
arsago
and
earned
a
good
deal
of
money
the
greater
part
of
which
i
always
sent
to
my
good
father
at
the
end
of
two
years
upon
my
entreaty
i
returned
to
florence
and
put
myself
once
more
under
francesco
salimbene
with
whom
i
earned
a
great
deal
and
took
continual
pains
to
improve
in
my
art
i
renewed
my
intimacy
with
francesco
di
filippo
and
though
i
was
too
much
given
to
pleasure
owing
to
that
accursed
music
i
never
neglected
to
devote
some
hours
of
the
day
or
night
to
study
at
that
time
i
fashioned
a
silver
as
it
was
then
so
called
this
was
a
girdle
three
inches
broad
which
used
to
be
made
for
brides
and
was
executed
in
half
relief
with
some
small
figures
in
the
round
it
was
a
commission
from
a
man
called
raffaello
lapaccini
i
was
very
badly
paid
but
the
honour
which
it
brought
me
was
worth
far
more
than
the
gain
i
might
have
justly
made
by
it
having
at
this
time
worked
with
many
different
persons
in
florence
i
had
come
to
know
some
worthy
men
among
the
goldsmiths
as
for
instance
marcone
my
first
master
but
i
also
met
with
others
reputed
honest
who
did
all
they
could
to
ruin
me
and
robbed
me
grossly
when
i
perceived
this
i
left
their
company
and
held
them
for
thieves
and
one
of
the
goldsmiths
called
giovanbattista
sogliani
kindly
accommodated
me
with
part
of
his
shop
which
stood
at
the
side
of
the
new
market
near
the
bank
there
i
finished
several
pretty
pieces
and
made
good
gains
and
was
able
to
give
my
family
much
help
this
roused
the
jealousy
of
the
bad
men
among
my
former
masters
who
were
called
salvadore
and
michele
guasconti
in
the
guild
of
the
goldsmiths
they
had
three
big
shops
and
drove
a
thriving
trade
on
becoming
aware
of
their
evil
will
against
me
i
complained
to
certain
worthy
fellows
and
remarked
that
they
ought
to
have
been
satisfied
with
the
thieveries
they
practised
on
me
under
the
cloak
of
hypocritical
kindness
this
coming
to
their
ears
they
threatened
to
make
me
sorely
repent
of
such
words
but
i
who
knew
not
what
the
colour
of
fear
was
paid
them
little
or
no
heed
xvi
it
chanced
one
day
that
i
was
leaning
against
a
shop
of
one
of
these
men
who
called
out
to
me
and
began
partly
reproaching
partly
bullying
i
answered
that
had
they
done
their
duty
by
me
i
should
have
spoken
of
them
what
one
speaks
of
good
and
worthy
men
but
as
they
had
done
the
contrary
they
ought
to
complain
of
themselves
and
not
of
me
while
i
was
standing
there
and
talking
one
of
them
named
gherardo
guasconti
their
cousin
having
perhaps
been
put
up
to
it
by
them
lay
in
wait
till
a
beast
of
burden
went
by
it
was
a
load
of
bricks
when
the
load
reached
me
gherardo
pushed
it
so
violently
on
my
body
that
i
was
very
much
hurt
turning
suddenly
round
and
seeing
him
laughing
i
struck
him
such
a
blow
on
the
temple
that
he
fell
down
stunned
like
one
dead
then
i
faced
round
to
his
cousins
and
said
the
way
to
treat
cowardly
thieves
of
your
sort
and
when
they
wanted
to
make
a
move
upon
me
trusting
to
their
numbers
i
whose
blood
was
now
well
up
laid
hands
to
a
little
knife
i
had
and
cried
one
of
you
comes
out
of
the
shop
let
the
other
run
for
the
confessor
because
the
doctor
will
have
nothing
to
do
these
words
so
frightened
them
that
not
one
stirred
to
help
their
cousin
as
soon
as
i
had
gone
the
fathers
and
sons
ran
to
the
eight
and
declared
that
i
had
assaulted
them
in
their
shops
with
sword
in
hand
a
thing
which
had
never
yet
been
seen
in
florence
the
magistrates
had
me
summoned
i
appeared
before
them
and
they
began
to
upbraid
and
cry
out
upon
i
think
because
they
saw
me
in
my
cloak
while
the
others
were
dressed
like
citizens
in
mantle
and
hood
but
also
because
my
adversaries
had
been
to
the
houses
of
those
magistrates
and
had
talked
with
all
of
them
in
private
while
i
inexperienced
in
such
matters
had
not
spoken
to
any
of
them
trusting
in
the
goodness
of
my
cause
i
said
that
having
received
such
outrage
and
insult
from
gherardo
and
in
my
fury
having
only
given
him
a
box
on
the
ear
i
did
not
think
i
deserved
such
a
vehement
reprimand
i
had
hardly
time
to
finish
the
word
box
before
prinzivalle
della
stufa
who
was
one
of
the
eight
interrupted
me
by
saying
gave
him
a
blow
and
not
a
box
on
the
the
bell
was
rung
and
we
were
all
ordered
out
when
prinzivalle
spoke
thus
in
my
defence
to
his
brother
judges
sirs
the
simplicity
of
this
poor
young
man
who
has
accused
himself
of
having
given
a
box
on
the
ear
under
the
impression
that
this
is
of
less
importance
than
a
blow
whereas
a
box
on
the
ear
in
the
new
market
carries
a
fine
of
crowns
while
a
blow
costs
little
or
nothing
he
is
a
young
man
of
admirable
talents
and
supports
his
poor
family
by
his
labour
in
great
abundance
i
would
to
god
that
our
city
had
plenty
of
this
sort
instead
of
the
present
dearth

the
italian

verb

the
double
meaning

varchi
says
that
a
man
who
went
about
with
only
his
cloak
or
cape
by
daytime

he
were
not
a
soldier
was
reputed

xvii
among
the
magistrates
were
some
radical
fellows
with
hoods
who
had
been
influenced
by
the
entreaties
and
the
calumnies
of
my
opponents
because
they
all
belonged
to
the
party
of
fra
girolamo
and
these
men
would
have
had
me
sent
to
prison
and
punished
without
too
close
a
reckoning
but
the
good
prinzivalle
put
a
stop
to
that
so
they
sentenced
me
to
pay
four
measures
of
flour
which
were
to
be
given
as
alms
to
the
nunnery
of
the
murate
i
was
called
in
again
and
he
ordered
me
not
to
speak
a
word
under
pain
of
their
displeasure
and
to
perform
the
sentence
they
had
passed
then
after
giving
me
another
sharp
rebuke
they
sent
us
to
the
chancellor
i
muttering
all
the
while
was
a
slap
and
not
a
blow
with
which
we
left
the
eight
bursting
with
laughter
the
chancellor
bound
us
over
upon
bail
on
both
sides
but
only
i
was
punished
by
having
to
pay
the
four
measures
of
meal
albeit
just
then
i
felt
as
though
i
had
been
massacred
i
sent
for
one
of
my
cousins
called
maestro
annibale
the
surgeon
father
of
messer
librodoro
librodori
desiring
that
he
should
go
bail
for
me
he
refused
to
come
which
made
me
so
angry
that
fuming
with
fury
and
swelling
like
an
asp
i
took
a
desperate
resolve
at
this
point
one
may
observe
how
the
stars
do
not
so
much
sway
as
force
our
conduct
when
i
reflected
on
the
great
obligations
which
this
annibale
owed
my
family
my
rage
grew
to
such
a
pitch
that
turning
wholly
to
evil
and
being
also
by
nature
somewhat
choleric
i
waited
till
the
magistrates
had
gone
to
dinner
and
when
i
was
alone
and
observed
that
none
of
their
officers
were
watching
me
in
the
fire
of
my
anger
i
left
the
palace
ran
to
my
shop
seized
a
dagger
and
rushed
to
the
house
of
my
enemies
who
were
at
home
and
shop
together
i
found
them
at
table
and
gherardo
who
had
been
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
flung
himself
upon
me
i
stabbed
him
in
the
breast
piercing
doublet
and
jerkin
through
and
through
to
the
shirt
without
however
grazing
his
flesh
or
doing
him
the
least
harm
in
the
world
when
i
felt
my
hand
go
in
and
heard
the
clothes
tear
i
thought
that
i
had
killed
him
and
seeing
him
fall
to
earth
i
cried
this
day
is
the
day
on
which
i
mean
to
murder
you
father
mother
and
sisters
thinking
the
last
day
had
come
threw
themselves
upon
their
knees
screaming
out
for
mercy
with
all
their
might
but
i
perceiving
that
they
offered
no
resistance
and
that
he
was
stretched
for
dead
upon
the
ground
thought
it
too
base
a
thing
to
touch
them
i
ran
storming
down
the
staircase
and
when
i
reached
the
street
i
found
all
the
rest
of
the
household
more
than
twelve
persons
one
of
them
had
seized
an
iron
shovel
another
a
thick
iron
pipe
one
had
an
anvil
some
of
them
hammers
and
some
cudgels
when
i
got
among
them
raging
like
a
mad
bull
i
flung
four
or
five
to
the
earth
and
fell
down
with
them
myself
continually
aiming
my
dagger
now
at
one
and
now
at
another
those
who
remained
upright
plied
both
hands
with
all
their
force
giving
it
me
with
hammers
cudgels
and
anvil
but
inasmuch
as
god
does
sometime
mercifully
intervene
he
so
ordered
that
neither
they
nor
i
did
any
harm
to
one
another
i
only
lost
my
cap
on
which
my
adversaries
seized
though
they
had
run
away
from
it
before
and
struck
at
it
with
all
their
weapons
afterwards
they
searched
among
their
dead
and
wounded
and
saw
that
not
a
single
man
was
injured

prayed
for

one
of

shaking
the

lucagnolo
from
iesi
a
country
fellow
who
while
yet
a
child
had
come
into
service
this
man
was
short
but
well
proportioned
and
was
a
more
skilful
craftsman
than
any
one
whom
i
had
met
with
up
to
that
time
remarkable
for
facility
and
excellent
in
design
he
executed
large
plate
only
that
is
to
say
vases
of
the
utmost
beauty
basons
and
such
pieces
having
put
myself
to
work
there
i
began
to
make
some
candelabra
for
the
bishop
of
salamanca
a
spaniard
they
were
richly
chased
so
far
as
that
sort
of
work
admits
a
pupil
of
raffaello
da
urbino
called
gian
francesco
and
commonly
known
as
il
fattore
was
a
painter
of
great
ability
and
being
on
terms
of
friendship
with
the
bishop
he
introduced
me
to
his
favour
so
that
i
obtained
many
commissions
from
that
prelate
and
earned
considerable
sums
of
money
during
that
time
i
went
to
draw
sometimes
in
michel
chapel
and
sometimes
in
the
house
of
agostino
chigi
of
siena
which
contained
many
incomparable
paintings
by
the
hand
of
that
great
master
raffaello
this
i
did
on
because
the
house
was
then
inhabited
by
messer
gismondo
brother
they
plumed
themselves
exceedingly
when
they
saw
young
men
of
my
sort
coming
to
study
in
their
palaces
wife
noticing
my
frequent
presence
in
that
was
a
lady
as
courteous
as
could
be
and
of
surpassing
up
to
me
one
day
looked
at
my
drawings
and
asked
me
if
i
was
a
sculptor
or
a
painter
to
whom
i
said
i
was
a
goldsmith
she
remarked
that
i
drew
too
well
for
a
goldsmith
and
having
made
one
of
her
bring
a
lily
of
the
finest
diamonds
set
in
gold
she
showed
it
to
me
and
bade
me
value
it
i
valued
it
at
crowns
then
she
said
that
i
had
very
nearly
hit
the
mark
and
asked
me
whether
i
felt
capable
of
setting
the
stones
really
well
i
said
that
i
should
much
like
to
do
so
and
began
before
her
eyes
to
make
a
little
sketch
for
it
working
all
the
better
because
of
the
pleasure
i
took
in
conversing
with
so
lovely
and
agreeable
a
gentlewoman
when
the
sketch
was
finished
another
roman
lady
of
great
beauty
joined
us
she
had
been
above
and
now
descending
to
the
asked
madonna
porzia
what
she
was
doing
there
she
answered
with
a
smile
am
amusing
myself
by
watching
this
worthy
young
man
at
his
drawing
he
is
as
good
as
he
is
i
had
by
this
time
acquired
a
trifle
of
assurance
mixed
however
with
some
honest
bashfulness
so
i
blushed
and
said
as
i
am
lady
i
shall
ever
be
most
ready
to
serve
the
gentlewoman
also
slightly
blushing
said
know
well
that
i
want
you
to
serve
me
and
reaching
me
the
lily
told
me
to
take
it
away
and
gave
me
besides
twenty
golden
crowns
which
she
had
in
her
bag
and
added
me
the
jewel
after
the
fashion
you
have
sketched
and
keep
for
me
the
old
gold
in
which
it
is
now
on
this
the
roman
lady
observed
i
were
in
that
young
body
i
should
go
off
without
asking
madonna
porzia
replied
that
virtues
rarely
are
at
home
with
vices
and
that
if
i
did
such
a
thing
i
should
strongly
belie
my
good
looks
of
an
honest
man
then
turning
round
she
took
the
roman
hand
and
with
a
pleasant
smile
said
i
stayed
on
a
short
while
at
the
drawing
i
was
making
which
was
a
copy
of
a
jove
by
raffaello
when
i
had
finished
it
and
left
the
house
i
set
myself
to
making
a
little
model
of
wax
in
order
to
show
how
the
jewel
would
look
when
it
was
completed
this
i
took
to
madonna
porzia
whom
i
found
with
the
same
roman
lady
both
of
them
were
highly
satisfied
with
my
work
and
treated
me
so
kindly
that
being
somewhat
emboldened
i
promised
the
jewel
should
be
twice
as
good
as
the
model
accordingly
i
set
hand
to
it
and
in
twelve
days
i
finished
it
in
the
form
of
a
as
i
have
said
above
ornamenting
it
with
little
masks
children
and
animals
exquisitely
enamelled
whereby
the
diamonds
which
formed
the
lily
were
more
than
doubled
in
effect

up
with

xx
while
i
was
working
at
this
piece
lucagnolo
of
whose
ability
i
have
before
spoken
showed
considerable
discontent
telling
me
over
and
over
again
that
i
might
acquire
far
more
profit
and
honour
by
helping
him
to
execute
large
plate
as
i
had
done
at
first
i
made
him
answer
that
whenever
i
chose
i
should
always
be
capable
of
working
at
great
silver
pieces
but
that
things
like
that
on
which
i
was
now
engaged
were
not
commissioned
every
day
and
beside
their
bringing
no
less
honour
than
large
silver
plate
there
was
also
more
profit
to
be
made
by
them
he
laughed
me
in
the
face
and
said
and
see
benvenuto
for
by
the
time
that
you
have
finished
that
work
of
yours
i
will
make
haste
to
have
finished
this
vase
which
i
took
in
hand
when
you
did
the
jewel
and
then
experience
shall
teach
you
what
profit
i
shall
get
from
my
vase
and
what
you
will
get
from
your
i
answered
that
i
was
very
glad
indeed
to
enter
into
such
a
competition
with
so
good
a
craftsman
as
he
was
because
the
end
would
show
which
of
us
was
mistaken
accordingly
both
the
one
and
the
other
of
us
with
a
scornful
smile
upon
our
lips
bent
our
heads
in
grim
earnest
to
the
work
which
both
were
now
desirous
of
accomplishing
so
that
after
about
ten
days
each
had
finished
his
undertaking
with
great
delicacy
and
artistic
skill
was
a
huge
silver
piece
used
at
the
table
of
pope
clement
into
which
he
flung
away
bits
of
bone
and
the
rind
of
divers
fruits
while
eating
an
object
of
ostentation
rather
than
necessity
the
vase
was
adorned
with
two
fine
handles
together
with
many
masks
both
small
and
great
and
masses
of
lovely
foliage
in
as
exquisite
a
style
of
elegance
as
could
be
imagined
on
seeing
which
i
said
it
was
the
most
beautiful
vase
that
ever
i
set
eyes
on
thinking
he
had
convinced
me
lucagnolo
replied
work
seems
to
me
no
less
beautiful
but
we
shall
soon
perceive
the
difference
between
the
so
he
took
his
vase
and
carried
it
to
the
pope
who
was
very
well
pleased
with
it
and
ordered
at
once
that
he
should
be
paid
at
the
ordinary
rate
of
such
large
plate
meanwhile
i
carried
mine
to
madonna
porzia
who
looked
at
it
with
astonishment
and
told
me
i
had
far
surpassed
my
promise
then
she
bade
me
ask
for
my
reward
whatever
i
liked
for
it
seemed
to
her
my
desert
was
so
great
that
if
i
craved
a
castle
she
could
hardly
recompense
me
but
since
that
was
not
in
her
hands
to
bestow
she
added
laughing
that
i
must
beg
what
lay
within
her
power
i
answered
that
the
greatest
reward
i
could
desire
for
my
labour
was
to
have
satisfied
her
ladyship
then
smiling
in
my
turn
and
bowing
to
her
i
took
my
leave
saying
i
wanted
no
reward
but
that
she
turned
to
the
roman
lady
and
said
see
that
the
qualities
we
discerned
in
him
are
companied
by
virtues
and
not
they
both
expressed
their
admiration
and
then
madonna
porzia
continued
benvenuto
have
you
never
heard
it
said
that
when
the
poor
give
to
the
rich
the
devil
laughs
i
replied
true
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
all
his
troubles
i
should
like
this
time
to
see
him
laugh
and
as
i
took
my
leave
she
said
that
this
time
she
had
no
will
to
bestow
on
him
that
favour
when
i
came
back
to
the
shop
lucagnolo
had
the
money
for
his
vase
in
a
paper
packet
and
on
my
arrival
he
cried
out
and
compare
the
price
of
your
jewel
with
the
price
of
my
i
said
that
he
must
leave
things
as
they
were
till
the
next
day
because
i
hoped
that
even
as
my
work
in
its
kind
was
not
less
excellent
than
his
so
i
should
be
able
to
show
him
quite
an
equal
price
for
it
xxi
on
the
day
following
madonna
porzia
sent
a
of
hers
to
my
shop
who
called
me
out
and
putting
into
my
hands
a
paper
packet
full
of
money
from
his
lady
told
me
that
she
did
not
choose
the
devil
should
have
his
whole
laugh
out
by
which
she
hinted
that
the
money
sent
me
was
not
the
entire
payment
merited
by
my
industry
and
other
messages
were
added
worthy
of
so
courteous
a
lady
lucagnolo
who
was
burning
to
compare
his
packet
with
mine
burst
into
the
shop
then
in
the
presence
of
twelve
journeymen
and
some
neighbours
eager
to
behold
the
result
of
this
competition
he
seized
his
packet
scornfully
exclaiming
ou
three
or
four
times
while
he
poured
his
money
on
the
counter
with
a
great
noise
they
were
crowns
in
giulios
and
he
fancied
that
mine
would
be
four
or
five
crowns
moneta
i
for
my
part
stunned
and
stifled
by
his
cries
and
by
the
looks
and
smiles
of
the
bystanders
first
peeped
into
my
packet
then
after
seeing
that
it
contained
nothing
but
gold
i
retired
to
one
end
of
the
counter
and
keeping
my
eyes
lowered
and
making
no
noise
at
all
i
lifted
it
with
both
hands
suddenly
above
my
head
and
emptied
it
like
a
mill
hopper
my
coin
was
twice
as
much
as
his
which
caused
the
onlookers
who
had
fixed
their
eyes
on
me
with
some
derision
to
turn
round
suddenly
to
him
and
say
pieces
being
all
of
gold
and
twice
as
many
as
yours
make
a
far
finer
i
thought
for
certain
that
what
with
jealousy
and
what
with
shame
lucagnolo
would
have
fallen
dead
upon
the
spot
and
though
he
took
the
third
part
of
my
gain
since
i
was
a
journeyman
for
such
is
the
custom
of
the
trade
fall
to
the
workman
and
to
the
masters
of
the
shop
yet
inconsiderate
envy
had
more
power
in
him
than
avarice
it
ought
indeed
to
have
worked
quite
the
other
way
he
being
a
son
from
iesi
he
cursed
his
art
and
those
who
taught
it
him
vowing
that
thenceforth
he
would
never
work
at
large
plate
but
give
his
whole
attention
to
those
brothel
gewgaws
since
they
were
so
well
paid
equally
enraged
on
my
side
i
answered
that
every
bird
sang
its
own
note
that
he
talked
after
the
fashion
of
the
hovels
he
came
from
but
that
i
dared
swear
that
i
should
succeed
with
ease
in
making
his
lubberly
lumber
while
he
would
never
be
successful
in
my
brothel
gewgaws
thus
i
flung
off
in
a
passion
telling
him
that
i
would
soon
show
him
that
i
spoke
truth
the
bystanders
openly
declared
against
him
holding
him
for
a
lout
as
indeed
he
was
and
me
for
a
man
as
i
had
proved
myself
note
di
giuli
and
di
moneta
the
was
a
silver
coin
worth
italian
centimes
the
di
moneta
was
worth
cellini
was
paid
in
golden
crowns
which
had
a
much
higher
value
the
and
the
at
this
epoch
were
reckoned
at
the
at
note
the
packet
was
and
cellini
poured
the
coins
out
from
the
broad
end
note
the
two
slang
phrases
translated
above
are
and
xxii
next
day
i
went
to
thank
madonna
porzia
and
told
her
that
her
ladyship
had
done
the
opposite
of
what
she
said
she
would
for
that
while
i
wanted
to
make
the
devil
laugh
she
had
made
him
once
more
deny
god
we
both
laughed
pleasantly
at
this
and
she
gave
me
other
commissions
for
fine
and
substantial
work
meanwhile
i
contrived
by
means
of
a
pupil
of
raffaello
da
urbino
to
get
an
order
from
the
bishop
of
salamanca
for
one
of
those
great
called
which
are
used
for
ornaments
to
place
on
sideboards
he
wanted
a
pair
made
of
equal
size
and
one
of
them
he
entrusted
to
lucagnolo
the
other
to
me
giovan
francesco
the
painter
i
have
mentioned
gave
us
the
design
accordingly
i
set
hand
with
marvellous
to
this
piece
of
plate
and
was
accommodated
with
a
part
of
his
workshop
by
a
milanese
named
maestro
giovan
piero
della
tacca
having
made
my
preparations
i
calculated
how
much
money
i
should
need
for
certain
affairs
of
my
own
and
sent
all
the
rest
to
assist
my
poor
father
it
so
happened
that
just
when
this
was
being
paid
to
him
in
florence
he
stumbled
upon
one
of
those
radicals
who
were
in
the
eight
at
the
time
when
i
got
into
that
little
trouble
there
it
was
the
very
man
who
had
abused
him
so
rudely
and
who
swore
that
i
should
certainly
be
sent
into
the
country
with
the
lances
now
this
fellow
had
some
sons
of
very
bad
morals
and
repute
wherefore
my
father
said
to
him
can
happen
to
anybody
especially
to
men
of
choleric
humour
when
they
are
in
the
right
even
as
it
happened
to
my
son
but
let
the
rest
of
his
life
bear
witness
how
virtuously
i
have
brought
him
up
would
god
for
your
that
your
sons
may
act
neither
worse
nor
better
toward
you
than
mine
do
to
me
god
rendered
me
able
to
bring
them
up
as
i
have
done
and
where
my
own
power
could
not
reach
he
who
rescued
them
against
your
expectation
out
of
your
violent
on
leaving
the
man
he
wrote
me
all
this
story
begging
me
for
sake
to
practise
music
at
times
in
order
that
i
might
not
lose
the
fine
accomplishment
which
he
had
taught
me
with
such
trouble
the
letter
so
overflowed
with
expressions
of
the
tenderest
fatherly
affection
that
i
was
moved
to
tears
of
filial
piety
resolving
before
he
died
to
gratify
him
amply
with
regard
to
music
thus
god
grants
us
those
lawful
blessings
which
we
ask
in
prayer
nothing
doubting

while
i
was
pushing
forward
vase
i
had
only
one
little
boy
as
help
whom
i
had
taken
at
the
entreaty
of
friends
and
half
against
my
own
will
to
be
my
workman
he
was
about
fourteen
years
of
age
bore
the
name
of
paulino
and
was
son
to
a
roman
burgess
who
lived
upon
the
income
of
his
property
paulino
was
the
the
most
honest
and
the
most
beautiful
boy
i
ever
saw
in
my
whole
life
his
modest
ways
and
actions
together
with
his
superlative
beauty
and
his
devotion
to
myself
bred
in
me
as
great
an
affection
for
him
as
a
breast
can
hold
this
passionate
love
led
me
oftentimes
to
delight
the
lad
with
music
for
i
observed
that
his
marvellous
features
which
by
complexion
wore
a
tone
of
modest
melancholy
brightened
up
and
when
i
took
my
cornet
broke
into
a
smile
so
lovely
and
so
sweet
that
i
do
not
marvel
at
the
silly
stories
which
the
greeks
have
written
about
the
deities
of
heaven
indeed
if
my
boy
had
lived
in
those
times
he
would
probably
have
turned
their
heads
still
more
he
had
a
sister
named
faustina
more
beautiful
i
verily
believe
than
that
faustina
about
whom
the
old
books
gossip
so
sometimes
he
took
me
to
their
vineyard
and
so
far
as
i
could
judge
it
struck
me
that
good
father
would
have
welcomed
me
as
a
this
affair
led
me
to
play
more
than
i
was
used
to
do
it
happened
at
that
time
that
one
giangiacomo
of
cesena
a
musician
in
the
band
and
a
very
excellent
performer
sent
word
through
lorenzo
the
trumpeter
of
lucca
who
is
now
in
our
service
to
inquire
whether
i
was
inclined
to
help
them
at
the
ferragosto
playing
soprano
with
my
cornet
in
some
motets
of
great
beauty
selected
by
them
for
that
occasion
although
i
had
the
greatest
desire
to
finish
the
vase
i
had
begun
yet
since
music
has
a
wondrous
charm
of
its
own
and
also
because
i
wished
to
please
my
old
father
i
consented
to
join
them
during
eight
days
before
the
festival
we
practised
two
hours
a
day
together
then
on
the
first
of
august
we
went
to
the
belvedere
and
while
pope
clement
was
at
table
we
played
those
carefully
studied
motets
so
well
that
his
holiness
protested
he
had
never
heard
music
more
sweetly
executed
or
with
better
harmony
of
parts
he
sent
for
giangiacomo
and
asked
him
where
and
how
he
had
procured
so
excellent
a
cornet
for
soprano
and
inquired
particularly
who
i
was
giangiacomo
told
him
my
name
in
full
whereupon
the
pope
said
then
he
is
the
son
of
maestro
giovanni
on
being
assured
i
was
the
pope
expressed
his
wish
to
have
me
in
his
service
with
the
other
bandsmen
giangiacomo
replied
blessed
father
i
can
not
pretend
for
certain
that
you
will
get
him
for
his
profession
to
which
he
devotes
himself
assiduously
is
that
of
a
goldsmith
and
he
works
in
it
miraculously
well
and
earns
by
it
far
more
than
he
could
do
by
to
this
the
pope
added
am
the
better
inclined
to
him
now
that
i
find
him
possessor
of
a
talent
more
than
i
expected
see
that
he
obtains
the
same
salary
as
the
rest
of
you
and
tell
him
from
me
to
join
my
service
and
that
i
will
find
work
enough
by
the
day
for
him
to
do
in
his
other
then
stretching
out
his
hand
he
gave
him
a
hundred
golden
crowns
of
the
camera
in
a
handkerchief
and
said
these
so
that
he
may
take
his
when
giangiacomo
left
the
pope
he
came
to
us
and
related
in
detail
all
that
the
pope
had
said
and
after
dividing
the
money
between
the
eight
of
us
and
giving
me
my
share
he
said
to
me
i
am
going
to
have
you
inscribed
among
our
i
replied
the
day
pass
i
will
give
my
when
i
left
them
i
went
meditating
whether
i
ought
to
accept
the
invitation
inasmuch
as
i
could
not
but
suffer
if
i
abandoned
the
noble
studies
of
my
art
the
following
night
my
father
appeared
to
me
in
a
dream
and
begged
me
with
tears
of
tenderest
affection
for
love
and
his
to
enter
upon
this
engagement
methought
i
answered
that
nothing
would
induce
me
to
do
so
in
an
instant
he
assumed
so
horrible
an
aspect
as
to
frighten
me
out
of
my
wits
and
cried
you
do
not
you
will
have
a
curse
but
if
you
do
may
you
be
ever
blessed
by
me
when
i
woke
i
ran
for
very
fright
to
have
myself
inscribed
then
i
wrote
to
my
old
father
telling
him
the
news
which
so
affected
him
with
extreme
joy
that
a
sudden
fit
of
illness
took
him
and
brought
him
to
door
in
his
answer
to
my
letter
he
told
me
that
he
too
had
dreamed
nearly
the
same
as
i
had
note
arebbe
fatti
piů
uscire
gangheri
would
have
taken
them
still
more
off
the
hinges
note
largest
piece
left
of
me
should
be
my
note
the
camera
apostolica
was
the
roman
exchequer
xxiv
knowing
now
that
i
had
gratified
my
honest
wish
i
began
to
think
that
everything
would
prosper
with
me
to
a
glorious
and
honourable
end
accordingly
i
set
myself
with
indefatigable
industry
to
the
completion
of
the
vase
i
had
begun
for
salamanca
that
prelate
was
a
very
extraordinary
man
extremely
rich
but
difficult
to
please
he
sent
daily
to
learn
what
i
was
doing
and
when
his
messenger
did
not
find
me
at
home
he
broke
into
fury
saying
that
he
would
take
the
work
out
of
my
hands
and
give
it
to
others
to
finish
this
came
of
my
slavery
to
that
accursed
music
still
i
laboured
diligently
night
and
day
until
when
i
had
brought
my
work
to
a
point
when
it
could
be
exhibited
i
submitted
it
to
the
inspection
of
the
bishop
this
so
increased
his
desire
to
see
it
finished
that
i
was
sorry
i
had
shown
it
at
the
end
of
three
months
i
had
it
ready
with
little
animals
and
foliage
and
masks
as
beautiful
as
one
could
hope
to
see
no
sooner
was
it
done
than
i
sent
it
by
the
hand
of
my
workman
paulino
to
show
that
able
artist
lucagnolo
of
whom
i
have
spoken
above
paulino
with
the
grace
and
beauty
which
belonged
to
him
spoke
as
follows
lucagnolo
benvenuto
bids
me
say
that
he
has
sent
to
show
you
his
promises
and
your
lumber
expecting
in
return
to
see
from
you
his
this
message
given
lucagnolo
took
up
the
vase
and
carefully
examined
it
then
he
said
to
paulino
boy
tell
your
master
that
he
is
a
great
and
able
artist
and
that
i
beg
him
to
be
willing
to
have
me
for
a
friend
and
not
to
engage
in
aught
the
mission
of
that
virtuous
and
marvellous
lad
caused
me
the
greatest
joy
and
then
the
vase
was
carried
to
salamanca
who
ordered
it
to
be
valued
lucagnolo
took
part
in
the
valuation
estimating
and
praising
it
far
above
my
own
opinion
salamanca
lifting
up
the
vase
cried
like
a
true
spaniard
swear
by
god
that
i
will
take
as
long
in
paying
him
as
he
has
lagged
in
making
when
i
heard
this
i
was
exceedingly
put
out
and
fell
to
cursing
all
spain
and
every
one
who
wished
well
to
it
amongst
other
beautiful
ornaments
this
vase
had
a
handle
made
all
of
one
piece
with
most
delicate
mechanism
which
when
a
spring
was
touched
stood
upright
above
the
mouth
of
it
while
the
prelate
was
one
day
ostentatiously
exhibiting
my
vase
to
certain
spanish
gentlemen
of
his
suite
it
chanced
that
one
of
them
upon
quitting
the
room
began
roughly
to
work
the
handle
and
as
the
gentle
spring
which
moved
it
could
not
bear
his
loutish
violence
it
broke
in
his
hand
aware
what
mischief
he
had
done
he
begged
the
butler
who
had
charge
of
the
plate
to
take
it
to
the
master
who
had
made
it
for
him
to
mend
and
promised
to
pay
what
price
he
asked
provided
it
was
set
to
rights
at
once
so
the
vase
came
once
more
into
my
hands
and
i
promised
to
put
it
forthwith
in
order
which
indeed
i
did
it
was
brought
to
me
before
dinner
and
at
the
man
who
brought
it
returned
all
in
a
sweat
for
he
had
run
the
whole
way
monsignor
having
again
asked
for
it
to
show
to
certain
other
gentlemen
the
butler
then
without
giving
me
time
to
utter
a
word
cried
quick
bring
the
i
who
wanted
to
act
at
leisure
and
not
to
give
up
to
him
said
that
i
did
not
mean
to
be
so
quick
the
got
into
such
a
rage
that
he
made
as
though
he
would
put
one
hand
to
his
sword
while
with
the
other
he
threatened
to
break
the
shop
open
to
this
i
put
a
stop
at
once
with
my
own
weapon
using
therewith
spirited
language
and
saying
am
not
going
to
give
it
to
you
go
and
tell
monsignor
your
master
that
i
want
the
money
for
my
work
before
i
let
it
leave
this
when
the
fellow
saw
he
could
not
obtain
it
by
swaggering
he
fell
to
praying
me
as
one
prays
to
the
cross
declaring
that
if
i
would
only
give
it
up
he
would
take
care
i
should
be
paid
these
words
did
not
make
me
swerve
from
my
purpose
but
i
kept
on
saying
the
same
thing
at
last
despairing
of
success
he
swore
to
come
with
spaniards
enough
to
cut
me
in
pieces
then
he
took
to
his
heels
while
i
who
inclined
to
believe
partly
in
their
murderous
attack
resolved
that
i
would
defend
myself
with
courage
so
i
got
an
admirable
little
gun
ready
which
i
used
for
shooting
game
and
muttered
to
myself
who
robs
me
of
my
property
and
labour
may
take
my
life
too
and
while
i
was
carrying
on
this
debate
in
my
own
mind
a
crowd
of
spaniards
arrived
led
by
their
who
with
the
headstrong
rashness
of
his
race
bade
them
go
in
and
take
the
vase
and
give
me
a
good
beating
hearing
these
words
i
showed
them
the
muzzle
of
my
gun
and
prepared
to
fire
and
cried
in
a
loud
voice
jews
traitors
is
it
thus
that
one
breaks
into
houses
and
shops
in
our
city
of
rome
come
as
many
of
you
thieves
as
like
an
inch
nearer
to
this
wicket
and
blow
all
their
brains
out
with
my
then
i
turned
the
muzzle
toward
their
and
making
as
though
i
would
discharge
it
called
out
you
big
thief
who
are
egging
them
on
i
mean
to
kill
you
he
clapped
spurs
to
the
jennet
he
was
riding
and
took
flight
headlong
the
commotion
we
were
making
stirred
up
all
the
neighbours
who
came
crowding
round
together
with
some
roman
gentlemen
who
chanced
to
pass
and
cried
but
kill
the
renegades
and
we
will
stand
by
these
words
had
the
effect
of
frightening
the
spaniards
in
good
earnest
they
withdrew
and
were
compelled
by
the
circumstances
to
relate
the
whole
affair
to
monsignor
being
a
man
of
inordinate
haughtiness
he
rated
the
members
of
his
household
both
because
they
had
engaged
in
such
an
act
of
violence
and
also
because
having
begun
they
had
not
gone
through
with
it
at
this
juncture
the
painter
who
had
been
concerned
in
the
whole
matter
came
in
and
the
bishop
bade
him
go
and
tell
me
that
if
i
did
not
bring
the
vase
at
once
he
would
make
mincemeat
of
me
but
if
i
brought
it
he
would
pay
its
price
down
these
threats
were
so
far
from
terrifying
me
that
i
sent
him
word
i
was
going
immediately
to
lay
my
case
before
the
pope
in
the
meantime
his
anger
and
my
fear
subsided
whereupon
being
guaranteed
by
some
roman
noblemen
of
high
degree
that
the
prelate
would
not
harm
me
and
having
assurance
that
i
should
be
paid
i
armed
myself
with
a
large
poniard
and
my
good
coat
of
mail
and
betook
myself
to
his
palace
where
he
had
drawn
up
all
his
household
i
entered
and
paulino
followed
with
the
silver
vase
it
was
just
like
passing
through
the
zodiac
neither
more
nor
less
for
one
of
them
had
the
face
of
the
lion
another
of
the
scorpion
a
third
of
the
crab
however
we
passed
onward
to
the
presence
of
the
rascally
priest
who
spouted
out
a
torrent
of
such
language
as
only
priests
and
spaniards
have
at
their
command
in
return
i
never
raised
my
eyes
to
look
at
him
nor
answered
word
for
word
that
seemed
to
augment
the
fury
of
his
anger
and
causing
paper
to
be
put
before
me
he
commanded
me
to
write
an
acknowledgment
to
the
effect
that
i
had
been
amply
satisfied
and
paid
in
full
then
i
raised
my
head
and
said
i
should
be
very
glad
to
do
so
when
i
had
received
the
money
the
rage
continued
to
rise
threats
and
recriminations
were
flung
about
but
at
last
the
money
was
paid
and
i
wrote
the
receipt
then
i
departed
glad
at
heart
and
in
high
spirits
note
the
italians
reckoned
time
from
sundown
till
sundown
counting
hours
was
therefore
two
hours
before
nightfall
one
hour
of
the
night
was
one
hour
after
nightfall
and
so
forth
by
this
system
of
reckoning
it
is
clear
that
the
hours
varied
with
the
season
of
the
year
and
unless
we
know
the
exact
month
in
which
an
event
took
place
we
can
not
translate
any
hour
into
terms

when
pope
clement
heard
the
had
seen
the
vase
before
but
it
was
not
shown
him
as
my
expressed
much
pleasure
and
spoke
warmly
in
my
praise
publicly
saying
that
he
felt
very
favourably
toward
me
this
caused
monsignor
salamanca
to
repent
that
he
had
hectored
over
me
and
in
order
to
make
up
our
quarrel
he
sent
the
same
painter
to
inform
me
that
he
meant
to
give
me
large
commissions
i
replied
that
i
was
willing
to
undertake
them
but
that
i
should
require
to
be
paid
in
advance
this
speech
too
came
to
pope
ears
and
made
him
laugh
heartily
cardinal
cibo
was
in
the
presence
and
the
pope
narrated
to
him
the
whole
history
of
my
dispute
with
the
bishop
then
he
turned
to
one
of
his
people
and
ordered
him
to
go
on
supplying
me
with
work
for
the
palace
cardinal
cibo
sent
for
me
and
after
some
time
spent
in
agreeable
conversation
gave
me
the
order
for
a
large
vase
bigger
than
i
likewise
obtained
commissions
from
cardinal
cornaro
and
many
others
of
the
holy
college
especially
ridolfi
and
salviati
they
all
kept
me
well
employed
so
that
i
earned
plenty
of
money
madonna
porzia
now
advised
me
to
open
a
shop
of
my
own
this
i
did
and
i
never
stopped
working
for
that
excellent
and
gentle
lady
who
paid
me
exceedingly
well
and
by
whose
means
perhaps
it
was
that
i
came
to
make
a
figure
in
the
world
i
contracted
close
friendship
with
signor
gabbriello
ceserino
at
that
time
gonfalonier
of
rome
and
executed
many
pieces
for
him
one
among
the
rest
is
worthy
of
mention
it
was
a
large
golden
medal
to
wear
in
the
hat
i
engraved
upon
it
leda
with
her
swan
and
being
very
well
pleased
with
the
workmanship
he
said
he
should
like
to
have
it
valued
in
order
that
i
might
be
properly
paid
now
since
the
medal
was
executed
with
consummate
skill
the
valuers
of
the
trade
set
a
far
higher
price
on
it
than
he
had
thought
of
i
therefore
kept
the
medal
and
got
nothing
for
my
pains
the
same
sort
of
adventures
happened
in
this
case
as
in
that
of
vase

some
incidents

have
no

laughing
and
joking
as
is
natural
when
a
crowd
of
men
come
together
to
make
merry
on
so
great
a
festival
it
chanced
that
a
swaggering
young
fellow
passed
by
he
was
a
soldier
of
rienzo
da
ceri
who
when
he
heard
the
noise
that
we
were
making
gave
vent
to
a
string
of
opprobrious
sarcasms
upon
the
folk
of
florence
i
who
was
the
host
of
those
great
artists
and
men
of
worth
taking
the
insult
to
myself
slipped
out
quietly
without
being
observed
and
went
up
to
him
i
ought
to
say
that
he
had
a
punk
of
his
there
and
was
going
on
with
his
stupid
ribaldries
to
amuse
her
when
i
met
him
i
asked
if
he
was
the
rash
fellow
who
was
speaking
evil
of
the
florentines
he
answered
at
once
am
that
on
this
i
raised
my
hand
struck
him
in
the
face
and
said
i
am
then
we
each
of
us
drew
our
swords
with
spirit
but
the
fray
had
hardly
begun
when
a
crowd
of
persons
intervened
who
rather
took
my
part
than
not
hearing
and
seeing
that
i
was
in
the
right
on
the
following
day
a
challenge
to
fight
with
him
was
brought
me
which
i
accepted
very
gladly
saying
that
i
expected
to
complete
this
job
far
quicker
than
those
of
the
other
art
i
practised
so
i
went
at
once
to
confer
with
a
fine
old
man
called
bevilacqua
who
was
reputed
to
have
been
the
first
sword
of
italy
because
he
had
fought
more
than
twenty
serious
duels
and
had
always
come
off
with
honour
this
excellent
man
was
a
great
friend
of
mine
he
knew
me
as
an
artist
and
had
also
been
concerned
as
intermediary
in
certain
ugly
quarrels
between
me
and
others
accordingly
when
he
had
learned
my
business
he
answered
with
a
smile
benvenuto
if
you
had
an
affair
with
mars
i
am
sure
you
would
come
out
with
honour
because
through
all
the
years
that
i
have
known
you
i
have
never
seen
you
wrongfully
take
up
a
so
he
consented
to
be
my
second
and
we
repaired
with
sword
in
hand
to
the
appointed
place
but
no
blood
was
shed
for
my
opponent
made
the
matter
up
and
i
came
with
much
credit
out
of
the
affair
i
will
not
add
further
particulars
for
though
they
would
be
very
interesting
in
their
own
way
i
wish
to
keep
both
space
and
words
for
my
art
which
has
been
my
chief
inducement
to
write
as
i
am
doing
and
about
which
i
shall
have
only
too
much
to
say
the
spirit
of
honourable
rivalry
impelled
me
to
attempt
some
other
masterpiece
which
should
equal
or
even
surpass
the
productions
of
that
able
craftsman
lucagnolo
whom
i
have
mentioned
still
i
did
not
on
this
account
neglect
my
own
fine
art
of
jewellery
and
so
both
the
one
and
the
other
wrought
me
much
profit
and
more
credit
and
in
both
of
them
i
continued
to
produce
things
of
marked
originality
there
was
at
that
time
in
rome
a
very
able
artist
of
perugia
named
lautizio
who
worked
only
in
one
department
where
he
was
sole
and
unrivalled
throughout
the
world
you
must
know
that
at
rome
every
cardinal
has
a
seal
upon
which
his
title
is
engraved
and
these
seals
are
made
just
as
large
as
a
hand
of
about
twelve
years
of
age
and
as
i
have
already
said
the
title
is
engraved
upon
the
seal
together
with
a
great
many
ornamental
figures
a
article
of
the
kind
fetches
a
hundred
or
more
than
a
hundred
crowns
this
excellent
workman
like
lucagnolo
roused
in
me
some
honest
rivalry
although
the
art
he
practised
is
far
remote
from
the
other
branches
of
and
consequently
lautizio
was
not
skilled
in
making
anything
but
seals
i
gave
my
mind
to
acquiring
his
craft
also
although
i
found
it
very
difficult
and
unrepelled
by
the
trouble
which
it
gave
me
i
went
on
zealously
upon
the
path
of
profit
and
improvement
there
was
in
rome
another
most
excellent
craftsman
of
ability
who
was
a
milanese
named
messer
caradosso
he
dealt
in
nothing
but
little
chiselled
medals
made
of
plates
of
metal
and
things
i
have
seen
of
his
some
paxes
in
half
relief
and
some
christs
a
palm
in
length
wrought
of
the
thinnest
golden
plates
so
exquisitely
done
that
i
esteemed
him
the
greatest
master
in
that
kind
i
had
ever
seen
and
envied
him
more
than
all
the
rest
together
there
were
also
other
masters
who
worked
at
medals
carved
in
steel
which
may
be
called
the
models
and
true
guides
for
those
who
aim
at
striking
coins
in
the
most
perfect
style
all
these
divers
arts
i
set
myself
with
unflagging
industry
to
learn
i
must
not
omit
the
exquisite
art
of
enamelling
in
which
i
have
never
known
any
one
excel
save
a
florentine
our
countryman
called
amerigo
i
did
not
know
him
but
was
well
acquainted
with
his
incomparable
masterpieces
nothing
in
any
part
of
the
world
or
by
craftsman
that
i
have
seen
approached
the
divine
beauty
of
their
workmanship
to
this
branch
too
i
devoted
myself
with
all
my
strength
although
it
is
extremely
difficult
chiefly
because
of
the
fire
which
after
long
time
and
trouble
spent
in
other
processes
has
to
be
applied
at
last
and
not
unfrequently
brings
the
whole
to
ruin
in
spite
of
its
great
difficulties
it
gave
me
so
much
pleasure
that
i
looked
upon
them
as
recreation
and
this
came
from
the
special
gift
which
the
god
of
nature
bestowed
on
me
that
is
to
say
a
temperament
so
happy
and
of
such
excellent
parts
that
i
was
freely
able
to
accomplish
whatever
it
pleased
me
to
take
in
hand
the
various
departments
of
art
which
i
have
described
are
very
different
one
from
the
other
so
that
a
man
who
excels
in
one
of
them
if
he
undertakes
the
others
hardly
ever
achieves
the
same
success
whereas
i
strove
with
all
my
power
to
become
equally
versed
in
all
of
them
and
in
the
proper
place
i
shall
demonstrate
that
i
attained
my
object
note
day
was
the
great
florentine
festival
on
which
all
the
guilds
went
in
procession
with
pageants
through
the
city
of
the
florentine
painter
ii
rosso
or
maitre
roux
this
is
the
first
mention
by
cellini
he
went
to
france
in
and
died
an
obscure
death
there
in
note
this
rienzo
renzo
or
lorenzo
da
ceri
was
a
captain
of
adventurers
or
condottiere
who
hired
his
mercenary
forces
to
paymasters
he
defended
crema
for
the
venetians
in
and
conquered
urbino
for
the
pope
in
afterwards
he
fought
for
the
french
in
the
italian
wars
we
shall
hear
more
of
him
again
during
the
sack
of
rome
note
the
italian
dal
mio
avversario
seems
to
mean
that
opponent
proposed
an
accommodation
apologized
or
stayed
the
duel
at
a
certain
point
note
see
treatise
cap
for
more
particulars
about
this
artist
note
his
real
name
was
ambrogio
foppa
the
nickname
caradosso
is
said
to
have
stuck
to
him
in
consequence
of
a
spaniard
calling
him
in
his
own
tongue
he
struck
leo
coins
and
we
possess
some
excellent
medallion
portraits
by
his
hand
note
for
him
consult
xxvii
at
that
time
while
i
was
still
a
young
man
of
about
there
raged
a
plague
of
such
extraordinary
violence
that
many
thousands
died
of
it
every
day
in
rome
somewhat
terrified
at
this
calamity
i
began
to
take
certain
amusements
as
my
mind
suggested
and
for
a
reason
which
i
will
presently
relate
i
had
formed
a
habit
of
going
on
to
the
ancient
buildings
and
copying
parts
of
them
in
wax
or
with
the
pencil
and
since
these
buildings
are
all
ruins
and
the
ruins
house
innumerable
pigeons
it
came
into
my
head
to
use
my
gun
against
these
birds
so
then
avoiding
all
commerce
with
people
in
my
terror
of
the
plague
i
used
to
put
a
on
my
boy
shoulder
and
he
and
i
went
out
alone
into
the
ruins
and
oftentimes
we
came
home
laden
with
a
cargo
of
the
fattest
pigeons
i
did
not
care
to
charge
my
gun
with
more
than
a
single
ball
and
thus
it
was
by
pure
skill
in
the
art
that
i
filled
such
heavy
bags
i
had
a
which
i
had
made
myself
inside
and
out
it
was
as
bright
as
any
mirror
i
also
used
to
make
a
very
fine
sort
of
powder
in
doing
which
i
discovered
secret
processes
beyond
any
which
have
yet
been
found
and
on
this
point
in
order
to
be
brief
i
will
give
but
one
particular
which
will
astonish
good
shots
of
every
degree
this
is
that
when
i
charged
my
gun
with
powder
weighing
of
the
ball
it
carried
two
hundred
paces
it
is
true
that
the
great
delight
i
took
in
this
exercise
bid
fair
to
withdraw
me
from
my
art
and
studies
yet
in
another
way
it
gave
me
more
than
it
deprived
me
of
seeing
that
each
time
i
went
out
shooting
i
returned
with
greatly
better
health
because
the
open
air
was
a
benefit
to
my
constitution
my
natural
temperament
was
melancholy
and
while
i
was
taking
these
amusements
my
heart
leapt
up
with
joy
and
i
found
that
i
could
work
better
and
with
far
greater
mastery
than
when
i
spent
my
whole
time
in
study
and
manual
labour
in
this
way
my
gun
at
the
end
of
the
game
stood
me
more
in
profit
than
in
loss
it
was
also
the
cause
of
my
making
acquaintance
with
certain
hunters
after
curiosities
who
followed
in
the
track
of
those
lombard
peasants
who
used
to
come
to
rome
to
till
the
vineyards
at
the
proper
season
while
digging
the
ground
they
frequently
turned
up
antique
medals
agates
chrysoprases
cornelians
and
cameos
also
sometimes
jewels
as
for
instance
emeralds
sapphires
diamonds
and
rubies
the
peasants
used
to
sell
things
of
this
sort
to
the
traders
for
a
mere
trifle
and
i
very
often
when
i
met
them
paid
the
latter
several
times
as
many
golden
crowns
as
they
had
given
giulios
for
some
object
independently
of
the
profit
i
made
by
this
traffic
which
was
at
least
tenfold
it
brought
me
also
into
agreeable
relations
with
nearly
all
the
cardinals
of
rome
i
will
only
touch
upon
a
few
of
the
most
notable
and
the
rarest
of
these
curiosities
there
came
into
my
hands
among
many
other
fragments
the
head
of
a
dolphin
about
as
big
as
a
not
only
was
the
style
of
this
head
extremely
beautiful
but
nature
had
here
far
surpassed
art
for
the
stone
was
an
emerald
of
such
good
colour
that
the
man
who
bought
it
from
me
for
tens
of
crowns
sold
it
again
for
hundreds
after
setting
it
as
a
i
will
mention
another
kind
of
gem
this
was
a
magnificent
topaz
and
here
art
equalled
nature
it
was
as
large
as
a
big
with
the
head
of
minerva
in
a
style
of
inconceivable
beauty
i
remember
yet
another
precious
stone
different
from
these
it
was
a
cameo
engraved
with
hercules
binding
cerberus
of
the
triple
throat
such
was
its
beauty
and
the
skill
of
its
workmanship
that
our
great
michel
agnolo
protested
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
wonderful
among
many
bronze
medals
i
obtained
one
upon
which
was
a
head
of
jupiter
it
was
the
largest
that
had
ever
been
seen
the
head
of
the
most
perfect
execution
and
it
had
on
the
reverse
side
a
very
fine
design
of
some
little
figures
in
the
same
style
i
might
enlarge
at
great
length
on
this
curiosity
but
i
will
refrain
for
fear
of
being
prolix
note
alle
velette
perhaps
in
wait
for
xxviii
as
i
have
said
above
the
plague
had
broken
out
in
rome
but
though
i
must
return
a
little
way
upon
my
steps
i
shall
not
therefore
abandon
the
main
path
of
my
history
there
arrived
in
rome
a
surgeon
of
the
highest
renown
who
was
called
maestro
giacomo
da
carpi
this
able
man
in
the
course
of
his
other
practice
undertook
the
most
desperate
cases
of
the
french
disease
in
rome
this
kind
of
illness
is
very
partial
to
the
priests
and
especially
to
the
richest
of
them
when
therefore
maestro
giacomo
had
made
his
talents
known
he
professed
to
work
miracles
in
the
treatment
of
such
cases
by
means
of
certain
fumigations
but
he
only
undertook
a
cure
after
stipulating
for
his
fees
which
he
reckoned
not
by
tens
but
by
hundreds
of
crowns
he
was
a
great
connoisseur
in
the
arts
of
design
chancing
to
pass
one
day
before
my
shop
he
saw
a
lot
of
drawings
which
i
had
laid
upon
the
counter
and
among
these
were
several
designs
for
little
vases
in
a
capricious
style
which
i
had
sketched
for
my
amusement
these
vases
were
in
quite
a
different
fashion
from
any
which
had
been
seen
up
to
that
date
he
was
anxious
that
i
should
finish
one
or
two
of
them
for
him
in
silver
and
this
i
did
with
the
fullest
satisfaction
seeing
they
exactly
suited
my
own
fancy
the
clever
surgeon
paid
me
very
well
and
yet
the
honour
which
the
vases
brought
me
was
worth
a
hundred
times
as
much
for
the
best
craftsmen
in
the
trade
declared
they
had
never
seen
anything
more
beautiful
or
better
executed
no
sooner
had
i
finished
them
than
he
showed
them
to
the
pope
and
the
next
day
following
he
betook
himself
away
from
rome
he
was
a
man
of
much
learning
who
used
to
discourse
wonderfully
about
medicine
the
pope
would
fain
have
had
him
in
his
service
but
he
replied
that
he
would
not
take
service
with
anybody
in
the
world
and
that
whoso
had
need
of
him
might
come
to
seek
him
out
he
was
a
person
of
great
sagacity
and
did
wisely
to
get
out
of
rome
for
not
many
months
afterwards
all
the
patients
he
had
treated
grew
so
ill
that
they
were
a
hundred
times
worse
off
than
before
he
came
he
would
certainly
have
been
murdered
if
he
had
stopped
he
showed
my
little
vases
to
several
persons
of
quality
amongst
others
to
the
most
excellent
duke
of
ferrara
and
pretended
that
he
had
got
them
from
a
great
lord
in
rome
by
telling
this
nobleman
that
if
he
wanted
to
be
cured
he
must
give
him
those
two
vases
and
that
the
lord
had
answered
that
they
were
antique
and
besought
him
to
ask
for
anything
else
which
it
might
be
convenient
for
him
to
give
provided
only
he
would
leave
him
those
but
according
to
his
own
account
maestro
giacomo
made
as
though
he
would
not
undertake
the
cure
and
so
he
got
them
i
was
told
this
by
messer
alberto
bendedio
in
ferrara
who
with
great
ostentation
showed
me
some
earthenware
copies
he
possessed
of
them
thereupon
i
laughed
and
as
i
said
nothing
messer
alberto
bendedio
who
was
a
haughty
man
flew
into
a
rage
and
said
are
laughing
at
them
are
you
and
i
tell
you
that
during
the
last
thousand
years
there
has
not
been
born
a
man
capable
of
so
much
as
copying
i
then
not
caring
to
deprive
them
of
so
eminent
a
reputation
kept
silence
and
admired
them
with
mute
stupefaction
it
was
said
to
me
in
rome
by
many
great
lords
some
of
whom
were
my
friends
that
the
work
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
was
in
their
opinion
of
marvellous
excellence
and
genuine
antiquity
whereupon
emboldened
by
their
praises
i
revealed
that
i
had
made
them
as
they
would
not
believe
it
and
as
i
wished
to
prove
that
i
had
spoken
truth
i
was
obliged
to
bring
evidence
and
to
make
new
drawings
of
the
vases
for
my
word
alone
was
not
enough
inasmuch
as
maestro
giacomo
had
cunningly
insisted
upon
carrying
off
the
old
drawings
with
him
by
this
little
job
i
earned
a

for
a
full
account
of
this
incident
at
ferrara
xxix
the
plague
went
dragging
on
for
many
months
but
i
had
as
yet
managed
to
keep
it
at
bay
for
though
several
of
my
comrades
were
dead
i
survived
in
health
and
freedom
now
it
chanced
one
evening
that
an
intimate
comrade
of
mine
brought
home
to
supper
a
bolognese
prostitute
named
faustina
she
was
a
very
fine
woman
but
about
thirty
years
of
age
and
she
had
with
her
a
little
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
faustina
belonging
to
my
friend
i
would
not
have
touched
her
for
all
the
gold
in
the
world
and
though
she
declared
she
was
madly
in
love
with
me
i
remained
steadfast
in
my
loyalty
but
after
they
had
gone
to
bed
i
stole
away
the
little
who
was
quite
a
fresh
maid
and
woe
to
her
if
her
mistress
had
known
of
it
the
result
was
that
i
enjoyed
a
very
pleasant
night
far
more
to
my
satisfaction
than
if
i
had
passed
it
with
faustina
i
rose
upon
the
hour
of
breaking
fast
and
felt
tired
for
i
had
travelled
many
miles
that
night
and
was
wanting
to
take
food
when
a
crushing
headache
seized
me
several
boils
appeared
on
my
left
arm
together
with
a
carbuncle
which
showed
itself
just
beyond
the
palm
of
the
left
hand
where
it
joins
the
wrist
everybody
in
the
house
was
in
a
panic
my
friend
the
cow
and
the
calf
all
fled
left
alone
there
with
my
poor
little
prentice
who
refused
to
abandon
me
i
felt
stifled
at
the
heart
and
made
up
my
mind
for
certain
i
was
a
dead
man
just
then
the
father
of
the
lad
went
by
who
was
physician
to
the
cardinal
iacoacci
and
lived
as
member
of
that
household
the
boy
called
out
father
and
see
benvenuto
he
is
in
bed
with
some
trifling
without
thinking
what
my
complaint
might
be
the
doctor
came
up
at
once
and
when
he
had
felt
my
pulse
he
saw
and
felt
what
was
very
contrary
to
his
own
wishes
turning
round
to
his
son
he
said
traitor
of
a
child
ruined
me
how
can
i
venture
now
into
the
presence
his
son
made
answer
father
this
man
my
master
is
worth
far
more
than
all
the
cardinals
in
then
the
doctor
turned
to
me
and
said
i
am
here
i
will
consent
to
treat
you
but
of
one
thing
only
i
warn
you
that
if
you
have
enjoyed
a
woman
you
are
to
this
i
replied
did
so
this
very
he
answered
whom
and
to
what
extent
i
said
night
and
with
a
girl
in
her
earliest
upon
this
perceiving
that
he
had
spoken
foolishly
he
made
haste
to
add
considering
the
sores
are
so
new
and
have
not
yet
begun
to
stink
and
that
the
remedies
will
be
taken
in
time
you
need
not
be
too
much
afraid
for
i
have
good
hopes
of
curing
when
he
had
prescribed
for
me
and
gone
away
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
called
giovanni
rigogli
came
in
who
fell
to
commiserating
my
great
suffering
and
also
my
desertion
by
my
comrade
and
said
of
good
cheer
my
benvenuto
for
i
will
never
leave
your
side
until
i
see
you
restored
to
i
told
him
not
to
come
too
close
since
it
was
all
over
with
me
only
i
besought
him
to
be
so
kind
as
to
take
a
considerable
quantity
of
crowns
which
were
lying
in
a
little
box
near
my
bed
and
when
god
had
thought
fit
to
remove
me
from
this
world
to
send
them
to
my
poor
father
writing
pleasantly
to
him
in
the
way
i
too
had
done
so
far
as
that
appalling
season
of
the
plague
permitted
my
beloved
friend
declared
that
he
had
no
intention
whatsoever
of
leaving
me
and
that
come
what
might
in
life
or
death
he
knew
very
well
what
was
his
duty
toward
a
friend
and
so
we
went
on
by
the
help
of
god
and
the
admirable
remedies
which
i
had
used
began
to
work
a
great
improvement
and
i
soon
came
well
out
of
that
dreadful
sickness
the
sore
was
still
open
with
a
plug
of
lint
inside
it
and
a
plaster
above
when
i
went
out
riding
on
a
little
wild
pony
he
was
covered
with
hair
four
fingers
long
and
was
exactly
as
big
as
a
bear
indeed
he
looked
just
like
a
bear
i
rode
out
on
him
to
visit
the
painter
rosso
who
was
then
living
in
the
country
toward
civita
vecchia
at
a
place
of
count
called
cervetera
i
found
my
friend
and
he
was
very
glad
to
see
me
whereupon
i
said
am
come
to
do
to
you
that
which
you
did
to
me
so
many
months
he
burst
out
laughing
embraced
and
kissed
me
and
begged
me
for
the
sake
to
keep
quiet
i
stayed
in
that
place
about
a
month
with
much
content
and
gladness
enjoying
good
wines
and
excellent
food
and
treated
with
the
greatest
kindness
by
the
count
every
day
i
used
to
ride
out
alone
along
the
seashore
where
i
dismounted
and
filled
my
pockets
with
all
sorts
of
pebbles
snail
shells
and
sea
shells
of
great
rarity
and
beauty
on
the
last
day
for
after
this
i
went
there
no
more
i
was
attacked
by
a
band
of
men
who
had
disguised
themselves
and
disembarked
from
a
moorish
privateer
when
they
thought
that
they
had
run
me
into
a
certain
passage
where
it
seemed
impossible
that
i
should
escape
from
their
hands
i
suddenly
mounted
my
pony
resolved
to
be
roasted
or
boiled
alive
at
that
pass
perilous
seeing
i
had
little
hope
to
evade
one
or
the
other
of
these
fates
but
as
god
willed
my
pony
who
was
the
same
i
have
described
above
took
an
incredibly
wide
jump
and
brought
me
off
in
safety
for
which
i
heartily
thanked
god
i
told
the
story
to
the
count
he
ran
to
arms
but
we
saw
the
galleys
setting
out
to
sea
the
next
day
following
i
went
back
sound
and
with
good
cheer
to
rome

am
not
sure
that
i
have
given
the
right
sense
in
the
text

interprets
the
words
thus
i
too
had
fared
according
to
the
wont
of
that
appalling
season
had
died
of
the
plague
but
i
think
the
version
in

sense
is
more
true

to
special
style

xxx
the
plague
had
by
this
time
almost
died
out
so
that
the
survivors
when
they
met
together
alive
rejoiced
with
much
delight
in
one
company
this
led
to
the
formation
of
a
club
of
painters
sculptors
and
goldsmiths
the
best
that
were
in
rome
and
the
founder
of
it
was
a
sculptor
with
the
name
of
michel
agnolo
he
was
a
sienese
and
a
man
of
great
ability
who
could
hold
his
own
against
any
other
workman
in
that
art
but
above
all
he
was
the
most
amusing
comrade
and
the
heartiest
good
fellow
in
the
universe
of
all
the
members
of
the
club
he
was
the
eldest
and
yet
the
youngest
from
the
strength
and
vigour
of
his
body
we
often
came
together
at
the
very
least
twice
a
week
i
must
not
omit
to
mention
that
our
society
counted
giulio
romano
the
painter
and
gian
francesco
both
of
them
celebrated
pupils
of
the
mighty
raffaello
da
urbino
after
many
and
many
merry
meetings
it
seemed
good
to
our
worthy
president
that
for
the
following
sunday
we
should
repair
to
supper
in
his
house
and
that
each
one
of
us
should
be
obliged
to
bring
with
him
his
crow
such
was
the
nickname
michel
agnolo
gave
to
women
in
the
club
and
that
whoso
did
not
bring
one
should
be
sconced
by
paying
a
supper
to
the
whole
company
those
of
us
who
had
no
familiarity
with
women
of
the
town
were
forced
to
purvey
themselves
at
no
small
trouble
and
expense
in
order
to
appear
without
disgrace
at
that
distinguished
feast
of
artists
i
had
reckoned
upon
being
well
provided
with
a
young
woman
of
considerable
beauty
called
pantasilea
who
was
very
much
in
love
with
me
but
i
was
obliged
to
give
her
up
to
one
of
my
dearest
friends
called
il
bachiacca
who
on
his
side
had
been
and
still
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
this
exchange
excited
a
certain
amount
of
anger
because
the
lady
seeing
i
had
abandoned
her
at
first
entreaty
imagined
that
i
held
in
slight
esteem
the
great
affection
which
she
bore
me
in
course
of
time
a
very
serious
incident
grew
out
of
this
misunderstanding
through
her
desire
to
take
revenge
for
the
affront
i
had
put
upon
her
whereof
i
shall
speak
hereafter
in
the
proper
place
well
then
the
hour
was
drawing
nigh
when
we
had
to
present
ourselves
before
that
company
of
men
of
genius
each
with
his
own
crow
and
i
was
still
unprovided
and
yet
i
thought
it
would
be
stupid
to
fail
of
such
a
madcap
bagatelle
but
what
particularly
weighed
upon
my
mind
was
that
i
did
not
choose
to
lend
the
light
of
my
countenance
in
that
illustrious
sphere
to
some
miserable
scarecrow
all
these
considerations
made
me
devise
a
pleasant
trick
for
the
increase
of
merriment
and
the
diffusion
of
mirth
in
our
society
having
taken
this
resolve
i
sent
for
a
stripling
of
sixteen
years
who
lived
in
the
next
house
to
mine
he
was
the
son
of
a
spanish
coppersmith
this
young
man
gave
his
time
to
latin
studies
and
was
very
diligent
in
their
pursuit
he
bore
the
name
of
diego
had
a
handsome
figure
and
a
complexion
of
marvellous
brilliancy
the
outlines
of
his
head
and
face
were
far
more
beautiful
than
those
of
the
antique
antinous
i
had
often
copied
them
gaining
thereby
much
honour
from
the
works
in
which
i
used
them
the
youth
had
no
acquaintances
and
was
therefore
quite
unknown
dressed
very
ill
and
negligently
all
his
affections
being
set
upon
those
wonderful
studies
of
his
after
bringing
him
to
my
house
i
begged
him
to
let
me
array
him
in
the
clothes
which
i
had
caused
to
be
laid
out
he
readily
complied
and
put
them
on
at
once
while
i
added
new
beauties
to
the
beauty
of
his
face
by
the
elaborate
and
studied
way
in
which
i
dressed
his
hair
in
his
ears
i
placed
two
little
rings
set
with
two
large
and
fair
pearls
the
rings
were
broken
they
only
clipped
his
ears
which
looked
as
though
they
had
been
pierced
afterwards
i
wreathed
his
throat
with
chains
of
gold
and
rich
jewels
and
ornamented
his
fair
hands
with
rings
then
i
took
him
in
a
pleasant
manner
by
one
ear
and
drew
him
before
a
great
the
lad
when
he
beheld
himself
cried
out
with
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
is
that
diego
i
said
is
diego
from
whom
until
this
day
i
never
asked
for
any
kind
of
favour
but
now
i
only
beseech
diego
to
do
me
pleasure
in
one
harmless
thing
and
it
is
want
him
to
come
in
those
very
clothes
to
supper
with
the
company
of
artists
whereof
he
has
often
heard
me
the
young
man
who
was
honest
virtuous
and
wise
checked
his
enthusiasm
bent
his
eyes
to
the
ground
and
stood
for
a
short
while
in
silence
then
with
a
sudden
move
he
lifted
up
his
face
and
said
benvenuto
i
will
go
now
let
us
i
wrapped
his
head
in
a
large
kind
of
napkin
which
is
called
in
rome
a
and
when
we
reached
the
place
of
meeting
the
company
had
already
assembled
and
everybody
came
forward
to
greet
me
michel
agnolo
had
placed
himself
between
giulio
and
giovan
francesco
i
lifted
the
veil
from
the
head
of
my
beauty
and
then
michel
agnolo
who
as
i
have
already
said
was
the
most
humorous
and
amusing
fellow
in
the
world
laid
his
two
hands
the
one
on
and
the
other
on
gian
shoulders
and
pulling
them
with
all
his
force
made
them
bow
down
while
he
on
his
knees
upon
the
floor
cried
out
for
mercy
and
called
to
all
the
folk
in
words
like
these
ye
of
what
sort
are
the
angels
of
paradise
for
though
they
are
called
angels
here
shall
ye
see
that
they
are
not
all
of
the
male
then
with
a
loud
voice
he
added
beauteous
angel
best
save
me
thou
make
thou
me
upon
this
my
charming
creature
laughed
and
lifted
the
right
hand
and
gave
him
a
papal
benediction
with
many
pleasant
words
to
boot
so
michel
agnolo
stood
up
and
said
it
was
the
custom
to
kiss
the
feet
of
the
pope
and
the
cheeks
of
angels
and
having
done
the
latter
to
diego
the
boy
blushed
deeply
which
immensely
enhanced
his
beauty
when
this
reception
was
over
we
found
the
whole
room
full
of
sonnets
which
every
man
of
us
had
made
and
sent
to
michel
agnolo
my
lad
began
to
read
them
and
read
them
all
aloud
so
gracefully
that
his
infinite
charms
were
heightened
beyond
the
powers
of
language
to
describe
then
followed
conversation
and
witty
sayings
on
which
i
will
not
enlarge
for
that
is
not
my
business
only
one
clever
word
must
be
mentioned
for
it
was
spoken
by
that
admirable
painter
giulio
who
looking
round
with
meaning
in
his
eyes
on
the
bystanders
and
fixing
them
particularly
upon
the
women
turned
to
michel
agnolo
and
said
dear
michel
agnolo
your
nickname
of
crow
very
well
suits
those
ladies
though
i
vow
they
are
somewhat
less
fair
than
crows
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
most
lovely
peacocks
which
fancy
could
have
when
the
banquet
was
served
and
ready
and
we
were
going
to
sit
down
to
table
giulio
asked
leave
to
be
allowed
to
place
us
this
being
granted
he
took
the
women
by
the
hand
and
arranged
them
all
upon
the
inner
side
with
my
fair
in
the
centre
then
he
placed
all
the
men
on
the
outside
and
me
in
the
middle
saying
there
was
no
honour
too
great
for
my
deserts
as
a
background
to
the
women
there
was
spread
an
espalier
of
natural
jasmines
in
full
beauty
which
set
off
their
charms
and
especially
to
such
great
advantage
that
words
would
fail
to
describe
the
effect
then
we
all
of
us
fell
to
enjoying
the
abundance
of
our
table
the
supper
was
followed
by
a
short
concert
of
delightful
music
voices
joining
in
harmony
with
instruments
and
forasmuch
as
they
were
singing
and
playing
from
the
book
my
beauty
begged
to
be
allowed
to
sing
his
part
he
performed
the
music
better
than
almost
all
the
rest
which
so
astonished
the
company
that
giulio
and
michel
agnolo
dropped
their
earlier
tone
of
banter
exchanging
it
for
terms
of
sober
heartfelt
admiration
after
the
music
was
over
a
certain
aurelio
ascolano
remarkable
for
his
gift
as
an
improvisatory
poet
began
to
extol
the
women
in
choice
phrases
of
exquisite
compliment
while
he
was
chanting
the
two
girls
who
had
my
beauty
between
them
never
left
off
chattering
one
of
them
related
how
she
had
gone
wrong
the
other
asked
mine
how
it
had
happened
with
her
and
who
were
her
friends
and
how
long
she
had
been
settled
in
rome
and
many
other
questions
of
the
kind
it
is
true
that
if
i
chose
to
describe
such
laughable
episodes
i
could
relate
several
odd
things
which
then
occurred
through
jealousy
on
my
account
but
since
they
form
no
part
of
my
design
i
pass
them
briefly
over
at
last
the
conversation
of
those
loose
women
vexed
my
beauty
whom
we
had
christened
pomona
for
the
nonce
and
pomona
wanting
to
escape
from
their
silly
talk
turned
restlessly
upon
her
chair
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
the
female
brought
by
giulio
asked
whether
she
felt
indisposed
pomona
answered
yes
she
thought
she
was
a
month
or
so
with
a
child
this
gave
them
the
opportunity
of
feeling
her
body
and
discovering
the
real
sex
of
the
supposed
woman
thereupon
they
quickly
withdrew
their
hands
and
rose
from
table
uttering
such
gibing
words
as
are
commonly
addressed
to
young
men
of
eminent
beauty
the
whole
room
rang
with
laughter
and
astonishment
in
the
midst
of
which
michel
agnolo
assuming
a
fierce
aspect
called
out
for
leave
to
inflict
on
me
the
penance
he
thought
fit
when
this
was
granted
he
lifted
me
aloft
amid
the
clamour
of
the
company
crying
live
the
gentleman
long
live
the
gentleman
and
added
that
this
was
the
punishment
i
deserved
for
having
played
so
fine
a
trick
thus
ended
that
most
agreeable
and
each
of
us
returned
to
his
own
dwelling
at
the
close
of
day
note
this
sculptor
came
to
rome
with
his
compatriot
baldassare
peruzzi
and
was
employed
upon
the
monument
of
pope
adrian
which
he
executed
with
some
help
from
tribolo

were

artists

this
epoch

it
would
take
too
long
to
describe
in
detail
all
the
many
and
divers
pieces
of
work
which
i
executed
for
a
great
variety
of
men
at
present
i
need
only
say
that
i
devoted
myself
with
sustained
diligence
and
industry
to
acquiring
mastery
in
the
several
branches
of
art
which
i
enumerated
a
short
while
back
and
so
i
went
on
labouring
incessantly
at
all
of
them
but
since
no
opportunity
has
presented
itself
as
yet
for
describing
my
most
notable
performances
i
shall
wait
to
report
them
in
their
proper
place
before
very
long
the
sienese
sculptor
michel
agnolo
of
whom
i
have
recently
been
speaking
was
at
that
time
making
the
monument
of
the
late
pope
adrian
giulio
romano
went
to
paint
for
the
marquis
of
mantua
the
other
members
of
the
club
betook
themselves
in
different
directions
each
to
his
own
business
so
that
our
company
of
artists
was
altogether
broken
up
about
this
time
there
fell
into
my
hands
some
little
turkish
poniards
the
handle
as
well
as
the
blade
of
these
daggers
was
made
of
iron
and
so
too
was
the
sheath
they
were
engraved
by
means
of
iron
implements
with
foliage
in
the
most
exquisite
turkish
style
very
neatly
filled
in
with
gold
the
sight
of
them
stirred
in
me
a
great
desire
to
try
my
own
skill
in
that
branch
so
different
from
the
others
which
i
practiced
and
finding
that
i
succeeded
to
my
satisfaction
i
executed
several
pieces
mine
were
far
more
beautiful
and
more
durable
than
the
turkish
and
this
for
divers
reasons
one
was
that
i
cut
my
grooves
much
deeper
and
with
wider
trenches
in
the
steel
for
this
is
not
usual
in
turkish
work
another
was
that
the
turkish
arabesques
are
only
composed
of
arum
leaves
a
few
small
sunflowers
and
though
these
have
a
certain
grace
they
do
not
yield
so
lasting
a
pleasure
as
the
patterns
which
we
use
it
is
true
that
in
italy
we
have
several
different
ways
of
designing
foliage
the
lombards
for
example
construct
very
beautiful
patterns
by
copying
the
leaves
of
briony
and
ivy
in
exquisite
curves
which
are
extremely
agreeable
to
the
eye
the
tuscans
and
the
romans
make
a
better
choice
because
they
imitate
the
leaves
of
the
acanthus
commonly
called
with
its
stalks
and
flowers
curling
in
divers
wavy
lines
and
into
these
arabesques
one
may
excellently
well
insert
the
figures
of
little
birds
and
different
animals
by
which
the
good
taste
of
the
artist
is
displayed
some
hints
for
creatures
of
this
sort
can
be
observed
in
nature
among
the
wild
flowers
as
for
instance
in
and
some
few
other
plants
which
must
be
combined
and
developed
with
the
help
of
fanciful
imaginings
by
clever
draughtsmen
such
arabesques
are
called
grotesques
by
the
ignorant
they
have
obtained
this
name
of
grotesques
among
the
moderns
through
being
found
in
certain
subterranean
caverns
in
rome
by
students
of
antiquity
which
caverns
were
formerly
chambers
cabinets
for
study
halls
and
apartments
of
like
nature
the
curious
discovering
them
in
such
places
since
the
level
of
the
ground
has
gradually
been
raised
while
they
have
remained
below
and
since
in
rome
these
vaulted
rooms
are
commonly
called
grottoes
it
has
followed
that
the
word
grotesque
is
applied
to
the
patterns
i
have
mentioned
but
this
is
not
the
right
term
for
them
inasmuch
as
the
ancients
who
delighted
in
composing
monsters
out
of
goats
cows
and
horses
called
these
chimerical
hybrids
by
the
name
of
monsters
and
the
modern
artificers
of
whom
i
speak
fashioned
from
the
foliage
which
they
copied
monsters
of
like
nature
for
these
the
proper
name
is
therefore
monsters
and
not
grotesques
well
then
i
designed
patterns
of
this
kind
and
filled
them
in
with
gold
as
i
have
mentioned
and
they
were
far
more
pleasing
to
the
eye
than
the
turkish
it
chanced
at
that
time
that
i
lighted
upon
some
jars
or
little
antique
urns
filled
with
ashes
and
among
the
ashes
were
some
iron
rings
inlaid
with
gold
for
the
ancients
also
used
that
art
and
in
each
of
the
rings
was
set
a
tiny
cameo
of
shell
on
applying
to
men
of
learning
they
told
me
that
these
rings
were
worn
as
amulets
by
folk
desirous
of
abiding
with
mind
unshaken
in
any
extraordinary
circumstance
whether
of
good
or
evil
fortune
hereupon
at
the
request
of
certain
noblemen
who
were
my
friends
i
undertook
to
fabricate
some
trifling
rings
of
this
kind
but
i
made
them
of
refined
steel
and
after
they
had
been
well
engraved
and
inlaid
with
gold
they
produced
a
very
beautiful
effect
and
sometimes
a
single
ring
brought
me
more
than
forty
crowns
merely
in
payment
for
my
labour
it
was
the
custom
at
that
epoch
to
wear
little
golden
medals
upon
which
every
nobleman
or
man
of
quality
had
some
device
or
fancy
of
his
own
engraved
and
these
were
worn
in
the
cap
of
such
pieces
i
made
very
many
and
found
them
extremely
difficult
to
work
i
have
already
mentioned
the
admirable
craftsman
caradosso
who
used
to
make
such
ornaments
and
as
there
were
more
than
one
figure
on
each
piece
he
asked
at
least
a
hundred
gold
crowns
for
his
fee
this
being
however
because
his
prices
were
so
high
but
because
he
worked
so
began
to
be
employed
by
certain
noblemen
for
whom
among
other
things
i
made
a
medal
in
competition
with
that
great
artist
and
it
had
four
figures
upon
which
i
had
expended
an
infinity
of
labour
these
men
of
quality
when
they
compared
my
piece
with
that
of
the
famous
caradosso
declared
that
mine
was
by
far
the
better
executed
and
more
beautiful
and
bade
me
ask
what
i
liked
as
the
reward
of
my
trouble
for
since
i
had
given
them
such
perfect
satisfaction
they
wished
to
do
the
like
by
me
i
replied
that
my
greatest
reward
and
what
i
most
desired
was
to
have
rivalled
the
masterpieces
of
so
eminent
an
artist
and
that
if
their
lordships
thought
i
had
i
acknowledged
myself
to
be
most
amply
rewarded
with
this
i
took
my
leave
and
they
immediately
sent
me
such
a
very
liberal
present
that
i
was
well
content
indeed
there
grew
in
me
so
great
a
spirit
to
do
well
that
to
this
event
i
attributed
what
will
afterwards
be
related
of
my
progress
note
arum
maculatum
and
the
sunflower
xxxii
i
shall
be
obliged
to
digress
a
little
from
the
history
of
my
art
unless
i
were
to
omit
some
annoying
incidents
which
have
happened
in
the
course
of
my
troubled
career
one
of
these
which
i
am
about
to
describe
brought
me
into
the
greatest
risk
of
my
life
i
have
already
told
the
story
of
the
club
and
of
the
farcical
adventures
which
happened
owing
to
the
woman
whom
i
mentioned
pantasilea
the
one
who
felt
for
me
that
false
and
fulsome
love
she
was
furiously
enraged
because
of
the
pleasant
trick
by
which
i
brought
diego
to
our
banquet
and
she
swore
to
be
revenged
on
me
how
she
did
so
is
mixed
up
with
the
history
of
a
young
man
called
luigi
pulci
who
had
recently
come
to
rome
he
was
the
son
of
one
of
the
pulcis
who
had
been
beheaded
for
incest
with
his
daughter
and
the
youth
possessed
extraordinary
gifts
for
poetry
together
with
sound
latin
scholarship
he
wrote
well
was
graceful
in
manners
and
of
surprising
personal
beauty
he
had
just
left
the
service
of
some
bishop
whose
name
i
do
not
remember
and
was
thoroughly
tainted
with
a
very
foul
disease
while
he
was
yet
a
lad
and
living
in
florence
they
used
in
certain
places
of
the
city
to
meet
together
during
the
nights
of
summer
on
the
public
streets
and
he
ranking
among
the
best
of
the
improvisatori
sang
there
his
recitations
were
so
admirable
that
the
divine
michel
agnolo
buonarroti
that
prince
of
sculptors
and
of
painters
went
wherever
he
heard
that
he
would
be
with
the
greatest
eagerness
and
delight
to
listen
to
him
there
was
a
man
called
piloto
a
goldsmith
very
able
in
his
art
who
together
with
myself
joined
buonarroti
upon
these
occasions
thus
acquaintance
sprang
up
between
me
and
luigi
pulci
and
so
after
the
lapse
of
many
years
he
came
in
the
miserable
plight
which
i
have
mentioned
to
make
himself
known
to
me
again
in
rome
beseeching
me
for
sake
to
help
him
moved
to
compassion
by
his
great
talents
by
the
love
of
my
fatherland
and
by
my
own
natural
tenderness
of
heart
i
took
him
into
my
house
and
had
him
medically
treated
in
such
wise
that
being
but
a
youth
he
soon
regained
his
health
while
he
was
still
pursuing
his
cure
he
never
omitted
his
studies
and
i
provided
him
with
books
according
to
the
means
at
my
disposal
the
result
was
that
luigi
recognising
the
great
benefits
he
had
received
from
me
oftentimes
with
words
and
tears
returned
me
thanks
protesting
that
if
god
should
ever
put
good
fortune
in
his
way
he
would
recompense
me
for
my
kindness
to
this
i
replied
that
i
had
not
done
for
him
as
much
as
i
desired
but
only
what
i
could
and
that
it
was
the
duty
of
human
beings
to
be
mutually
serviceable
only
i
suggested
that
he
should
repay
the
service
i
had
rendered
him
by
doing
likewise
to
some
one
who
might
have
the
same
need
of
him
as
he
had
had
of
me
the
young
man
in
question
began
to
frequent
the
court
of
rome
where
he
soon
found
a
situation
and
enrolled
himself
in
the
suite
of
a
bishop
a
man
of
eighty
years
who
bore
the
title
of
gurgensis
this
bishop
had
a
nephew
called
messer
giovanni
he
was
a
nobleman
of
venice
and
the
said
messer
giovanni
made
show
of
marvellous
attachment
to
luigi
talents
and
under
the
pretence
of
these
talents
he
brought
him
as
familiar
to
himself
as
his
own
flesh
blood
luigi
having
talked
of
me
and
of
his
great
obligations
to
me
with
messer
giovanni
the
latter
expressed
a
wish
to
make
my
acquaintance
thus
then
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
had
upon
a
certain
evening
invited
that
woman
pantasilea
to
supper
and
had
assembled
a
company
of
men
of
parts
who
were
my
friends
just
at
the
moment
of
our
sitting
down
to
table
messer
giovanni
and
luigi
pulci
arrived
and
after
some
complimentary
speeches
they
both
remained
to
sup
with
us
the
shameless
strumpet
casting
her
eyes
upon
the
young
beauty
began
at
once
to
lay
her
nets
for
him
perceiving
which
when
the
supper
had
come
to
an
agreeable
end
i
took
luigi
aside
and
conjured
him
by
the
benefits
he
said
he
owed
me
to
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
her
to
this
he
answered
heavens
benvenuto
do
you
then
take
me
for
a
madman
i
rejoined
for
a
madman
but
for
a
young
fellow
and
i
swore
to
him
by
god
do
not
give
that
woman
the
least
thought
but
for
your
sake
i
should
be
sorry
if
through
her
you
come
to
break
your
upon
these
words
he
vowed
and
prayed
to
god
that
if
ever
he
but
spoke
with
her
he
might
upon
the
moment
break
his
neck
i
think
the
poor
lad
swore
this
oath
to
god
with
all
his
heart
for
he
did
break
his
neck
as
i
shall
presently
relate
messer
giovanni
showed
signs
too
evident
of
loving
him
in
a
dishonourable
way
for
we
began
to
notice
that
luigi
had
new
suits
of
silk
and
velvet
every
morning
and
it
was
known
that
he
abandoned
himself
altogether
to
bad
courses
he
neglected
his
fine
talents
and
pretended
not
to
see
or
recognise
me
because
i
had
once
rebuked
him
and
told
him
he
was
giving
his
soul
to
foul
vices
which
would
make
him
break
his
neck
as
he
had
vowed
note
piloto
of
whom
we
shall
hear
more
hereafter

a
prominent
figure
in
the
florentine
society
of
artists

celebrated
practical

that
a
young
man
of
whom
he
had
spoken

murdered

should
be
studied
by
those
who
seek
an
insight
into
this
curious
bohemia
of
the
sixteenth
century

girolamo
balbo
of
the
noble
venetian

xxxiii
now
messer
giovanni
bought
his
favourite
a
very
fine
black
horse
for
which
he
paid
crowns
the
beast
was
admirably
trained
to
hand
so
that
luigi
could
go
daily
to
caracole
around
the
lodgings
of
that
prostitute
pantasilea
though
i
took
notice
of
this
i
paid
it
no
attention
only
remarking
that
all
things
acted
as
their
nature
prompted
and
meanwhile
i
gave
my
whole
mind
to
my
studies
it
came
to
pass
one
sunday
evening
that
we
were
invited
to
sup
together
with
the
sienese
sculptor
michel
agnolo
and
the
time
of
the
year
was
summer
bachiacca
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
was
present
at
the
party
and
he
had
brought
with
him
his
old
flame
pantasilea
when
we
were
at
table
she
sat
between
me
and
bachiacca
but
in
the
very
middle
of
the
banquet
she
rose
and
excused
herself
upon
the
pretext
of
a
natural
need
saying
she
would
speedily
return
we
meanwhile
continued
talking
very
agreeably
and
supping
but
she
remained
an
unaccountably
long
time
absent
it
chanced
that
keeping
my
ears
open
i
thought
i
heard
a
sort
of
subdued
tittering
in
the
street
below
i
had
a
knife
in
hand
which
i
was
using
for
my
service
at
the
table
the
window
was
so
close
to
where
i
sat
that
by
merely
rising
i
could
see
luigi
in
the
street
together
with
pantasilea
and
i
heard
luigi
saying
if
that
devil
benvenuto
only
saw
us
we
just
catch
it
she
answered
no
fear
only
listen
to
the
noise
making
we
are
the
last
thing
thinking
at
these
words
having
made
them
both
well
out
i
leaped
from
the
window
and
took
luigi
by
the
cape
and
certainly
i
should
then
have
killed
him
with
the
knife
i
held
but
that
he
was
riding
a
white
horse
to
which
he
clapped
spurs
leaving
his
cape
in
my
grasp
in
order
to
preserve
his
life
pantasilea
took
to
her
heels
in
the
direction
of
a
neighbouring
church
the
company
at
supper
rose
immediately
and
came
down
entreating
me
in
a
body
to
refrain
from
putting
myself
and
them
to
inconvenience
for
a
strumpet
i
told
them
that
i
should
not
have
let
myself
be
moved
on
her
account
but
that
i
was
bent
on
punishing
the
infamous
young
man
who
showed
how
little
he
regarded
me
accordingly
i
would
not
yield
to
the
remonstrances
of
those
ingenious
and
worthy
men
but
took
my
sword
and
went
alone
toward
prati
house
where
we
were
supping
i
should
say
stood
close
to
the
castello
gate
which
led
to
prati
walking
thus
upon
the
road
to
prati
i
had
not
gone
far
before
the
sun
sank
and
i
rome
itself
at
a
slow
pace
night
had
fallen
darkness
had
come
on
but
the
gates
of
rome
were
not
yet
shut
toward
two
hours
after
sunset
i
walked
along
lodging
with
the
intention
if
luigi
pulci
were
there
of
doing
something
to
the
discontent
of
both
when
i
heard
and
saw
that
no
one
but
a
poor
called
canida
was
in
the
house
i
went
to
put
away
my
cloak
and
the
scabbard
of
my
sword
and
then
returned
to
the
house
which
stood
behind
the
banchi
on
the
river
tiber
just
opposite
stretched
a
garden
belonging
to
an
innkeeper
called
romolo
it
was
enclosed
by
a
thick
hedge
of
thorns
in
which
i
hid
myself
standing
upright
and
waiting
till
the
woman
came
back
with
luigi
after
keeping
watch
awhile
there
my
friend
bachiacca
crept
up
to
me
whether
led
by
his
own
suspicions
or
by
the
advice
of
others
i
can
not
say
in
a
low
voice
he
called
out
to
me
for
so
we
used
to
name
ourselves
for
fun
and
then
he
prayed
me
for
love
using
the
words
which
follow
with
tears
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
gossip
i
entreat
you
not
to
injure
that
poor
girl
she
at
least
has
erred
in
no
wise
in
this
not
at
when
i
heard
what
he
was
saying
i
replied
you
take
yourself
off
now
at
this
first
word
i
utter
i
will
bring
my
sword
here
down
upon
your
overwhelmed
with
fright
my
poor
gossip
was
suddenly
taken
ill
with
the
colic
and
withdrew
to
ease
himself
apart
indeed
he
could
not
buy
obey
the
call
there
was
a
glorious
heaven
of
stars
which
shed
good
light
to
see
by
all
of
a
sudden
i
was
aware
of
the
noise
of
many
horses
they
were
coming
toward
me
from
the
one
side
and
the
other
it
turned
out
to
be
luigi
and
pantasilea
attended
by
a
certain
messer
benvegnato
of
perugia
who
was
chamberlain
to
pope
clement
and
followed
by
four
doughty
captains
of
perugia
with
some
other
valiant
soldiers
in
the
flower
of
youth
altogether
reckoned
there
were
more
than
twelve
swords
when
i
understood
the
matter
and
saw
not
how
to
fly
i
did
my
best
to
crouch
into
the
hedge
but
the
thorns
pricked
and
hurt
me
goading
me
to
madness
like
a
bull
and
i
had
half
resolved
to
take
a
leap
and
hazard
my
escape
just
then
luigi
with
his
arm
round
neck
was
heard
crying
must
kiss
you
once
again
if
only
to
insult
that
traitor
at
that
moment
annoyed
as
i
was
by
the
prickles
and
irritated
by
the
young
words
i
sprang
forth
lifted
my
sword
on
high
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
are
all
dead
folk
my
blow
descended
on
the
shoulder
of
luigi
but
the
satyrs
who
doted
on
him
had
steeled
his
person
round
with
coasts
of
mail
and
villainous
defences
still
the
stroke
fell
with
crushing
force
swerving
aside
the
sword
hit
pantasilea
full
in
nose
and
mouth
both
she
and
luigi
grovelled
on
the
ground
while
bachiacca
with
his
breeches
down
to
heels
screamed
out
and
ran
away
then
i
turned
upon
the
others
boldly
with
my
sword
and
those
valiant
fellows
hearing
a
sudden
commotion
in
the
tavern
thought
there
was
an
army
coming
of
a
hundred
men
and
though
they
drew
their
swords
with
spirit
yet
two
horses
which
had
taken
fright
in
the
tumult
cast
them
into
such
disorder
that
a
couple
of
the
best
riders
were
thrown
and
the
remainder
took
to
flight
i
seeing
that
the
affair
was
turning
out
well
for
me
ran
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
came
off
with
honour
from
the
engagement
not
wishing
to
tempt
fortune
more
than
was
my
duty
during
this
some
of
the
soldiers
and
captains
wounded
themselves
with
their
own
arms
and
messer
benvegnato
the
chamberlain
was
kicked
and
trampled
by
his
mule
one
of
the
servants
also
who
had
drawn
his
sword
fell
down
together
with
his
master
and
wounded
him
badly
in
the
hand
maddened
by
the
pain
he
swore
louder
than
all
the
rest
in
his
perugian
jargon
crying
out
the
body
of
god
i
will
take
care
that
benvegnato
teaches
benvenuto
how
to
he
afterwards
commissioned
one
of
the
captains
who
were
with
him
braver
perhaps
than
the
others
but
with
less
aplomb
as
being
but
a
youth
to
seek
me
out
the
fellow
came
to
visit
me
in
the
place
of
by
retirement
that
was
the
palace
of
a
great
neapolitan
nobleman
who
had
become
acquainted
with
me
in
my
art
and
had
besides
taken
a
fancy
to
me
because
of
my
physical
and
mental
aptitude
for
fighting
to
which
my
lord
himself
was
personally
well
inclined
so
then
finding
myself
made
much
of
and
being
precisely
in
my
element
i
gave
such
answer
to
the
captain
as
i
think
must
have
made
him
earnestly
repent
of
having
come
to
look
me
up
after
a
few
days
when
the
wounds
of
luigi
and
the
strumpet
and
the
rest
were
healing
this
great
neapolitan
nobleman
received
overtures
from
messer
benvegnato
for
the
anger
had
cooled
and
he
proposed
to
ratify
a
peace
between
me
and
luigi
and
the
soldiers
who
had
personally
no
quarrel
with
me
and
only
wished
to
make
my
acquaintance
accordingly
my
friend
the
nobleman
replied
that
he
would
bring
me
where
they
chose
to
appoint
and
that
he
was
very
willing
to
effect
a
reconciliation
he
stipulated
that
no
words
should
be
bandied
about
on
either
side
seeing
that
would
be
little
to
their
credit
it
was
enough
to
go
through
the
form
of
drinking
together
and
exchanging
kisses
he
for
his
part
undertook
to
do
the
talking
and
promised
to
settle
the
matter
to
their
honour
this
arrangement
was
carried
out
on
thursday
evening
my
protector
took
me
to
the
house
of
messer
benvegnato
where
all
the
soldiers
who
had
been
present
at
that
discomfiture
were
assembled
and
already
seated
at
table
my
nobleman
was
attended
by
thirty
brave
fellows
all
well
armed
a
circumstance
which
messer
benvegnato
had
not
anticipated
when
we
came
into
the
hall
he
walking
first
i
following
he
speak
to
this
effect
save
you
gentlemen
we
have
come
to
see
you
i
and
benvenuto
whom
i
love
like
my
own
brother
and
we
are
ready
to
do
whatever
you
messer
benvegnato
seeing
the
hall
filled
with
such
a
crowd
of
men
called
out
is
only
peace
and
nothing
else
we
ask
of
accordingly
he
promised
that
the
governor
of
rome
and
his
catchpoles
should
give
me
no
trouble
then
we
made
peace
and
i
returned
to
my
shop
where
i
could
not
stay
an
hour
without
that
neapolitan
nobleman
either
coming
to
see
me
or
sending
for
me
meanwhile
luigi
pulci
having
recovered
from
his
wound
rode
every
day
upon
the
black
horse
which
was
so
well
trained
to
heel
and
bridle
one
day
among
others
after
it
had
rained
a
little
and
he
was
making
his
horse
curvet
just
before
door
he
slipped
and
fell
with
the
horse
upon
him
his
right
leg
was
broken
short
off
in
the
thigh
and
after
a
few
days
he
died
there
in
lodgings
discharging
thus
the
vow
he
registered
so
heartily
to
heaven
even
so
may
it
be
seen
that
god
keeps
account
of
the
good
and
the
bad
and
gives
to
each
one
what
he
merits
note
the
porta
castello
was
the
gate
called
after
the
castle
of
angelo
prati
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
was
an
open
space
between
the
borgo
and
the
bridge
of
angelo
in
order
to
get
inside
rome
itself
cellini
had
to
pass
a
second
gate
his
own
lodging
and
house
were
in
the
quarter
of
the
bianchi
where
are
now
the
via
giulia
and
via
banchi
vecchi
xxxiv
the
whole
world
was
now
in
warfare
pope
clement
had
sent
to
get
some
troops
from
giovanni
medici
and
when
they
came
they
made
such
disturbances
in
rome
that
it
was
ill
living
in
open
shops
on
this
account
i
retired
to
a
good
snug
house
behind
the
banchi
where
i
worked
for
all
the
friends
i
had
acquired
since
i
produced
few
things
of
much
importance
at
that
period
i
need
not
waste
time
in
talking
about
them
i
took
much
pleasure
in
music
and
amusements
of
the
kind
on
the
death
of
giovanni
medici
in
lombardy
the
pope
at
the
advice
of
messer
jacopo
salviati
dismissed
the
five
bands
he
had
engaged
and
when
the
constable
of
bourbon
knew
there
were
no
troops
in
rome
he
pushed
his
army
with
the
utmost
energy
up
to
the
city
the
whole
of
rome
upon
this
flew
to
arms
i
happened
to
be
intimate
with
alessandro
the
son
of
piero
del
bene
who
at
the
time
when
the
colonnesi
entered
rome
had
requested
me
to
guard
his
palace
on
this
more
serious
occasion
therefore
he
prayed
me
to
enlist
fifty
comrades
for
the
protection
of
the
said
house
appointing
me
their
captain
as
i
had
been
when
the
colonnesi
came
so
i
collected
fifty
young
men
of
the
highest
courage
and
we
took
up
our
quarters
in
his
palace
with
good
pay
and
excellent
appointments
army
had
now
arrived
before
the
walls
of
rome
and
alessandro
begged
me
to
go
with
him
to
reconnoitre
so
we
went
with
one
of
the
stoutest
fellows
in
our
company
and
on
the
way
a
youth
called
cecchino
della
casa
joined
himself
to
us
on
reaching
the
walls
by
the
campo
santo
we
could
see
that
famous
army
which
was
making
every
effort
to
enter
the
town
upon
the
ramparts
where
we
took
our
station
several
young
men
were
lying
killed
by
the
besiegers
the
battle
raged
there
desperately
and
there
was
the
densest
fog
imaginable
i
turned
to
alessandro
and
said
us
go
home
as
soon
as
we
can
for
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
here
you
see
the
enemies
are
mounting
and
our
men
are
in
alessandro
in
a
panic
cried
god
that
we
had
never
come
here
and
turned
in
maddest
haste
to
fly
i
took
him
up
somewhat
sharply
with
these
words
you
have
brought
me
here
i
must
perform
some
action
worthy
of
a
man
and
directing
my
arquebuse
where
i
saw
the
thickest
and
most
serried
troop
of
fighting
men
i
aimed
exactly
at
one
whom
i
remarked
to
be
higher
than
the
rest
the
fog
prevented
me
from
being
certain
whether
he
was
on
horseback
or
on
foot
then
i
turned
to
alessandro
and
cecchino
and
bade
them
discharge
their
arquebuses
showing
them
how
to
avoid
being
hit
by
the
besiegers
when
we
had
fired
two
rounds
apiece
i
crept
cautiously
up
to
the
wall
and
observing
among
the
enemy
a
most
extraordinary
confusion
i
discovered
afterwards
that
one
of
our
shots
had
killed
the
constable
of
bourbon
and
from
what
i
subsequently
learned
he
was
the
man
whom
i
had
first
noticed
above
the
heads
of
the
rest
quitting
our
position
on
the
ramparts
we
crossed
the
campo
santo
and
entered
the
city
by
then
coming
out
exactly
at
the
church
of
santo
agnolo
we
got
with
the
greatest
difficulty
to
the
great
gate
of
the
castle
for
the
generals
renzo
di
ceri
and
orazio
baglioni
were
wounding
and
slaughtering
everybody
who
abandoned
the
defence
of
the
walls
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
great
gate
part
of
the
foemen
had
already
entered
rome
and
we
had
them
in
our
rear
the
castellan
had
ordered
the
portcullis
to
be
lowered
in
order
to
do
which
they
cleared
a
little
space
and
this
enabled
us
four
to
get
inside
on
the
instant
that
i
entered
the
captain
pallone
medici
claimed
me
as
being
of
the
papal
household
and
forced
me
to
abandon
alessandro
which
i
had
to
do
much
against
my
will
i
ascended
to
the
keep
and
at
the
same
instant
pope
clement
came
in
through
the
corridors
into
the
castle
he
had
refused
to
leave
the
palace
of
peter
earlier
being
unable
to
believe
that
his
enemies
would
effect
their
entrance
into
rome
having
got
into
the
castle
in
this
way
i
attached
myself
to
certain
pieces
of
artillery
which
were
under
the
command
of
a
bombardier
called
giuliano
fiorentino
leaning
there
against
the
battlements
the
unhappy
man
could
see
his
poor
house
being
sacked
and
his
wife
and
children
outraged
fearing
to
strike
his
own
folk
he
dared
not
discharge
the
cannon
and
flinging
the
burning
fuse
upon
the
ground
he
wept
as
though
his
heart
would
break
and
tore
his
cheeks
with
both
his
hands
some
of
the
other
bombardiers
were
behaving
in
like
manner
seeing
which
i
took
one
of
the
matches
and
got
the
assistance
of
a
few
men
who
were
not
overcome
by
their
emotions
i
aimed
some
swivels
and
falconets
at
points
where
i
saw
it
would
be
useful
and
killed
with
them
a
good
number
of
the
enemy
had
it
not
been
for
this
the
troops
who
poured
into
rome
that
morning
and
were
marching
straight
upon
the
castle
might
possibly
have
entered
it
with
ease
because
the
artillery
was
doing
them
no
damage
i
went
on
firing
under
the
eyes
of
several
cardinals
and
lords
who
kept
blessing
me
and
giving
me
the
heartiest
encouragement
in
my
enthusiasm
i
strove
to
achieve
the
impossible
let
it
suffice
that
it
was
i
who
saved
the
castle
that
morning
and
brought
the
other
bombardiers
back
to
their
duty
i
worked
hard
the
whole
of
that
day
and
when
the
evening
came
while
the
army
was
marching
into
rome
through
the
trastevere
pope
clement
appointed
a
great
roman
nobleman
named
antonio
santacroce
to
be
captain
of
all
the
gunners
the
first
thing
this
man
did
was
to
come
to
me
and
having
greeted
me
with
the
utmost
kindness
he
stationed
me
with
five
fine
pieces
of
artillery
on
the
highest
point
of
the
castle
to
which
the
name
of
the
angel
specially
belongs
this
circular
eminence
goes
round
the
castle
and
surveys
both
prati
and
the
town
of
rome
the
captain
put
under
my
orders
enough
men
to
help
in
managing
my
guns
and
having
seen
me
paid
in
advance
he
gave
me
rations
of
bread
and
a
little
wine
and
begged
me
to
go
forward
as
i
had
begun
i
was
perhaps
more
inclined
by
nature
to
the
profession
of
arms
than
to
the
one
i
had
adopted
and
i
took
such
pleasure
in
its
duties
that
i
discharged
them
better
than
those
of
my
own
art
night
came
the
enemy
had
entered
rome
and
we
who
were
in
the
castle
especially
myself
who
have
always
taken
pleasure
in
extraordinary
sights
stayed
gazing
on
the
indescribable
scene
of
tumult
and
conflagration
in
the
streets
below
people
who
were
anywhere
else
but
where
we
were
could
not
have
formed
the
least
imagination
of
what
it
was
i
will
not
however
set
myself
to
describe
that
tragedy
but
will
content
myself
with
continuing
the
history
of
my
own
life
and
the
circumstances
which
properly
belong
to
it
note
war
had
broken
out
in
between
charles
v
and
francis
i
which
disturbed
all
europe
and
involved
the
states
of
italy
in
serious
complications
at
the
moment
when
this
chapter
opens
the
imperialist
army
under
the
constable
of
bourbon
was
marching
upon
rome
in
note
these
troops
entered
rome
in
october
they
were
disbanded
in
march
note
cellini
here
refers
to
the
attack
made
upon
rome
by
the
great
ghibelline
house
of
colonna
led
by
their
chief
captain
pompeo
in
september
they
took
possession
of
the
city
and
drove
clement
into
the
castle
of
angelo
where
they
forced
him
to
agree
to
terms
favouring
the
imperial
cause
it
was
customary
for
roman
gentlemen
to
hire
bravi
for
the
defence
of
their
palaces
when
any
extraordinary
disturbance
was
expected
as
for
example
upon
the
vacation
of
the
papal
chair
note
all
historians
of
the
sack
of
rome
agree
in
saying
that
bourbon
was
shot
dead
while
placing
ladders
against
the
outworks
near
the
shop
cellini
mentions
but
the
honour
of
firing
the
arquebuse
which
brought
him
down
can
not
be
assigned
to
any
one
in
particular
very
different
stories
were
current
on
the
subject

orazio
baglioni
of
the
perugian
family
was
a
distinguished
condottiere
he
subsequently
obtained
the
captaincy
of
the
bande
nere
and
died
fighting
near
naples
in
orazio
murdered
several
of
his
cousins
in
order
to
acquire
the
lordship
of
perugia
his
brother
malatesta
undertook
to
defend
florence
in
the
siege
of
and
sold
the
city
by
treason
to
clement
note
giovio
in
his
life
of
the
cardinal
prospero
colonna
relates
how
he
accompanied
clement
in
his
flight
from
the
vatican
to
the
castle
while
passing
some
open
portions
of
the
gallery
he
threw
his
violent
mantle
and
cap
of
a
monsignore
over
the
white
stole
of
the
pontiff
for
fear
he
might
be
shot
at
by
the
soldiers
in
the
streets
below
note
the
short
autobiography
of
raffaello
da
montelupo
a
man
in
many
respects
resembling
cellini
confirms
this
part
of
our
narrative
it
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
pieces
of
evidence
regarding
what
went
on
inside
the
castle
during
the
sack
of
rome
montelupo
was
also
a
gunner
and
commanded
two
pieces
note
this
is
an
instance
of
exaggeration
he
did
more
than
service
no
doubt
but
we
can
not
believe
that
without
him
the
castle
would
have
been
taken
xxxv
during
the
course
of
my
artillery
practice
which
i
never
intermitted
through
the
whole
month
passed
by
us
beleaguered
in
the
castle
i
met
with
a
great
many
very
striking
accidents
all
of
them
worthy
to
be
related
but
since
i
do
not
care
to
be
too
prolix
or
to
exhibit
myself
outside
the
sphere
of
my
profession
i
will
omit
the
larger
part
of
them
only
touching
upon
those
i
can
not
well
neglect
which
shall
be
the
fewest
in
number
and
the
most
remarkable
the
first
which
comes
to
hand
is
this
messer
antonio
santacroce
had
made
me
come
down
from
the
angel
in
order
to
fire
on
some
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
where
certain
of
our
besiegers
had
been
seen
to
enter
while
i
was
firing
a
cannon
shot
reached
me
which
hit
the
angle
of
a
battlement
and
carried
off
enough
of
it
to
be
the
cause
why
i
sustained
no
injury
the
whole
mass
struck
me
in
the
chest
and
took
my
breath
away
i
lay
stretched
upon
the
ground
like
a
dead
man
and
could
hear
what
the
bystanders
were
saying
among
them
all
messer
antonio
santacroce
lamented
greatly
exclaiming
alas
we
have
lost
the
best
defender
that
we
attracted
by
the
uproar
one
of
my
comrades
ran
up
he
was
called
gianfrancesco
and
was
a
bandsman
but
was
far
more
naturally
given
to
medicine
than
to
music
on
the
spot
he
flew
off
crying
for
a
stoop
of
the
very
best
greek
wine
then
he
made
a
tile
and
cast
upon
it
a
good
handful
of
wormwood
after
which
he
sprinkled
the
greek
wine
and
when
the
wormwood
was
well
soaked
he
laid
it
on
my
breast
just
where
the
bruise
was
visible
to
all
such
was
the
virtue
of
the
wormwood
that
i
immediately
regained
my
scattered
faculties
i
wanted
to
begin
to
speak
but
could
not
for
some
stupid
soldiers
had
filled
my
mouth
with
earth
imagining
that
by
so
doing
they
were
giving
me
the
sacrament
and
indeed
they
were
more
like
to
have
excommunicated
me
since
i
could
with
difficulty
come
to
myself
again
the
earth
doing
me
more
mischief
than
the
blow
however
i
escaped
that
danger
and
returned
to
the
rage
and
fury
of
the
guns
pursuing
my
work
there
with
all
the
ability
and
eagerness
that
i
could
summon
pope
clement
by
this
had
sent
to
demand
assistance
from
the
duke
of
urbino
who
was
with
the
troops
of
venice
he
commissioned
the
envoy
to
tell
his
excellency
that
the
castle
of
angelo
would
send
up
every
evening
three
beacons
from
its
summit
accompanied
by
three
discharges
of
the
cannon
thrice
repeated
and
that
so
long
as
this
signal
was
continued
he
might
take
for
granted
that
the
castle
had
not
yielded
i
was
charged
with
lighting
the
beacons
and
firing
the
guns
for
this
purpose
and
all
this
while
i
pointed
my
artillery
by
day
upon
the
places
where
mischief
could
be
done
the
pope
in
consequence
began
to
regard
me
with
still
greater
favour
because
he
saw
that
i
discharged
my
functions
as
intelligently
as
the
task
demanded
aid
from
the
duke
of
urbino
never
came
on
which
as
it
is
not
my
business
i
will
make
no
further
comment
note
francesco
maria
della
rovere
duke
of
urbino
commanded
a
considerable
army
as
general
of
the
church
and
was
now
acting
for
venice
why
he
effected
no
diversion
while
the
imperial
troops
were
marching
upon
rome
and
why
he
delayed
to
relieve
the
city
was
never
properly
explained
folk
attributed
his
impotent
conduct
partly
to
a
natural
sluggishness
in
warfare
and
partly
to
his
hatred
for
the
house
of
medici
leo
x
had
deprived
him
of
his
dukedom
and
given
it
to
a
medicean
prince
it
is
to
this
that
cellini
probably
refers
in
the
cautious
phrase
which
ends
the
chapter
xxxvi
while
i
was
at
work
upon
that
diabolical
task
of
mine
there
came
from
time
to
time
to
watch
me
some
of
the
cardinals
who
were
invested
in
the
castle
and
most
frequently
the
cardinal
of
ravenna
and
the
cardinal
gaddi
i
often
told
them
not
to
show
themselves
since
their
nasty
red
caps
gave
a
fair
mark
to
our
enemies
from
neighbouring
buildings
such
as
the
torre
bini
we
ran
great
peril
when
they
were
there
and
at
last
i
had
them
locked
off
and
gained
thereby
their
deep
i
frequently
received
visits
also
from
the
general
orazio
baglioni
who
was
very
well
affected
toward
me
one
day
while
he
was
talking
with
me
he
noticed
something
going
forward
in
a
outside
the
porta
di
castello
which
bore
the
name
of
baccanello
this
tavern
had
for
sign
a
sun
painted
between
two
windows
of
a
bright
red
colour
the
windows
being
closed
signor
orazio
concluded
that
a
band
of
soldiers
were
carousing
at
table
just
between
them
and
behind
the
sun
so
he
said
to
me
if
you
think
that
you
could
hit
that
wall
an
breadth
from
the
sun
with
your
here
i
believe
you
would
be
doing
a
good
stroke
of
business
for
there
is
a
great
commotion
there
and
men
of
much
importance
must
probably
be
inside
the
i
answered
that
i
felt
quite
capable
of
hitting
the
sun
in
its
centre
but
that
a
barrel
full
of
stones
which
was
standing
close
to
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
might
be
knocked
down
by
the
shock
of
the
discharge
and
the
blast
of
the
artillery
he
rejoined
waste
time
benvenuto
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
possible
where
it
is
standing
that
the
blast
should
bring
it
down
and
even
if
it
were
to
fall
and
the
pope
himself
was
underneath
the
mischief
would
not
be
so
great
as
you
imagine
fire
then
only
fire
taking
no
more
thought
about
it
i
struck
the
sun
in
the
centre
exactly
as
i
said
i
should
the
cask
was
dislodged
as
i
predicted
and
fell
precisely
between
cardinal
farnese
and
messer
jacopo
salviati
it
might
very
well
have
dashed
out
the
brains
of
both
of
them
except
that
just
at
that
very
moment
farnese
was
reproaching
salviati
with
having
caused
the
sack
of
rome
and
while
they
stood
apart
from
one
another
to
exchange
opprobrious
remarks
my
gabion
fell
without
destroying
them
when
he
heard
the
uproar
in
the
court
below
good
signor
orazio
dashed
off
in
a
hurry
and
i
thrusting
my
neck
forward
where
the
cask
had
fallen
heard
some
people
saying
would
not
be
a
bad
job
to
kill
that
gunner
upon
this
i
turned
two
falconets
toward
the
staircase
with
mind
resolved
to
let
blaze
on
the
first
man
who
attempted
to
come
up
the
household
of
cardinal
farnese
must
have
received
orders
to
go
and
do
me
some
injury
accordingly
i
prepared
to
receive
them
with
a
lighted
match
in
hand
recognising
some
who
were
approaching
i
called
out
lazy
lubbers
if
you
pack
off
from
there
and
if
but
a
child
among
you
dares
to
touch
the
staircase
i
have
got
two
cannon
loaded
which
will
blow
you
into
powder
go
and
tell
the
cardinal
that
i
was
acting
at
the
order
of
superior
officers
and
that
what
we
have
done
and
are
doing
is
in
defence
of
them
priests
and
not
to
hurt
they
made
away
and
then
came
signor
orazio
baglioni
running
i
bade
him
stand
back
else
murder
him
for
i
knew
very
well
who
he
was
he
drew
back
a
little
not
without
a
certain
show
of
fear
and
called
out
i
am
your
friend
to
this
i
answered
come
up
but
come
alone
and
then
come
as
you
the
general
who
was
a
man
of
mighty
pride
stood
still
a
moment
and
then
said
angrily
have
a
good
mind
not
to
come
up
again
and
to
do
quite
the
opposite
of
that
which
i
intended
toward
i
replied
that
just
as
i
was
put
there
to
defend
my
neighbours
i
was
equally
well
able
to
defend
myself
too
he
said
that
he
was
coming
alone
and
when
he
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
his
features
were
more
discomposed
that
i
thought
reasonable
so
i
kept
my
hand
upon
my
sword
and
stood
eyeing
him
askance
upon
this
he
began
to
laugh
and
the
colour
coming
back
into
his
face
he
said
to
me
with
the
most
pleasant
manner
benvenuto
i
bear
you
as
great
love
as
i
have
it
in
my
heart
to
give
and
in
good
time
i
will
render
you
proof
of
this
would
to
god
that
you
had
killed
those
two
rascals
for
one
of
them
is
the
cause
of
all
this
trouble
and
the
day
perchance
will
come
when
the
other
will
be
found
the
cause
of
something
even
he
then
begged
me
if
i
should
be
asked
not
to
say
that
he
was
with
me
when
i
fired
the
gun
and
for
the
rest
bade
me
be
of
good
cheer
the
commotion
which
the
affair
made
was
enormous
and
lasted
a
long
while
however
i
will
not
enlarge
upon
it
further
only
adding
that
i
was
within
an
inch
of
revenging
my
father
on
messer
jacopo
salviati
who
had
grievously
injured
him
according
to
my
complaints
as
it
was
unwittingly
i
gave
the
fellow
a
great
fright
of
farnese
i
shall
say
nothing
here
because
it
will
appear
in
its
proper
place
how
well
it
would
have
been
if
i
had
killed
him

we
have
already
heard
note
preti
perhaps
priests
xxxvii
i
pursued
my
business
of
artilleryman
and
every
day
performed
some
extraordinary
feat
whereby
the
credit
and
the
favour
i
acquired
with
the
pope
was
something
indescribable
there
never
passed
a
day
but
what
i
killed
one
or
another
of
our
enemies
in
the
besieging
army
on
one
occasion
the
pope
was
walking
round
the
circular
keep
when
he
observed
a
spanish
colonel
in
the
prati
he
recognised
the
man
by
certain
indications
seeing
that
this
officer
had
formerly
been
in
his
service
and
while
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
him
he
kept
talking
about
him
i
above
by
the
angel
knew
nothing
of
all
this
but
spied
a
fellow
down
there
busying
himself
about
the
trenches
with
a
javelin
in
his
hand
he
was
dressed
entirely
in
and
so
studying
the
worst
that
i
could
do
against
him
i
selected
a
gerfalcon
which
i
had
at
hand
it
is
a
piece
of
ordnance
larger
and
longer
than
a
swivel
and
about
the
size
of
a
demiculverin
this
i
emptied
and
loaded
it
again
with
a
good
charge
of
fine
powder
mixed
with
the
coarser
sort
then
i
aimed
it
exactly
at
the
man
in
red
elevating
prodigiously
because
a
piece
of
that
calibre
could
hardly
be
expected
to
carry
true
at
such
a
distance
i
fired
and
hit
my
man
exactly
in
the
middle
he
had
trussed
his
sword
in
front
for
swagger
after
a
way
those
spaniards
have
and
my
ball
when
it
struck
him
broke
upon
the
blade
and
one
could
see
the
fellow
cut
in
two
fair
halves
the
pope
who
was
expecting
nothing
of
this
kind
derived
great
pleasure
and
amazement
from
the
sight
both
because
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
one
should
aim
and
hit
the
mark
at
such
a
distance
and
also
because
the
man
was
cut
in
two
and
he
could
not
comprehend
how
this
should
happen
he
sent
for
me
and
asked
about
it
i
explained
all
the
devices
i
had
used
in
firing
but
told
him
that
why
the
man
was
cut
in
halves
neither
he
nor
i
could
know
upon
my
bended
knees
i
then
besought
him
to
give
me
the
pardon
of
his
blessing
for
that
homicide
and
for
all
the
others
i
had
committed
in
the
castle
in
the
service
of
the
church
thereat
the
pope
raising
his
hand
and
making
a
large
open
sign
of
the
cross
upon
my
face
told
me
that
he
blessed
me
and
that
he
gave
me
pardon
for
all
murders
i
had
ever
perpetrated
or
should
ever
perpetrate
in
the
service
of
the
apostolic
church
when
i
felt
him
i
went
aloft
and
never
stayed
from
firing
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
and
few
were
the
shots
of
mine
that
missed
their
mark
my
drawing
and
my
fine
studies
in
my
craft
and
my
charming
art
of
music
all
were
swallowed
up
in
the
din
of
that
artillery
and
if
i
were
to
relate
in
detail
all
the
splendid
things
i
did
in
that
infernal
work
of
cruelty
i
should
make
the
world
stand
by
and
wonder
but
not
to
be
too
prolix
i
will
pass
them
over
only
i
must
tell
a
few
of
the
most
remarkable
which
are
as
it
were
forced
in
upon
me
to
begin
then
pondering
day
and
night
what
i
could
render
for
my
own
part
in
defence
of
holy
church
and
having
noticed
that
the
enemy
changed
guard
and
marched
past
through
the
great
gate
of
santo
spirito
which
was
within
a
reasonable
range
i
thereupon
directed
my
attention
to
that
spot
but
having
to
shoot
sideways
i
could
not
do
the
damage
that
i
wished
although
i
killed
a
fair
percentage
every
day
this
induced
our
adversaries
when
they
saw
their
passage
covered
by
my
guns
to
load
the
roof
of
a
certain
house
one
night
with
thirty
gabions
which
obstructed
the
view
i
formerly
enjoyed
taking
better
thought
than
i
had
done
of
the
whole
situation
i
now
turned
all
my
five
pieces
of
artillery
directly
on
the
gabions
and
waited
till
the
evening
hour
when
they
changed
guard
our
enemies
thinking
they
were
safe
came
on
at
greater
ease
and
in
a
closer
body
than
usual
whereupon
i
set
fire
to
my
not
merely
did
i
dash
to
pieces
the
gabions
which
stood
in
my
way
but
what
was
better
by
that
one
blast
i
slaughtered
more
than
thirty
men
in
consequence
of
this
man
oelig
uvre
which
i
repeated
twice
the
soldiers
were
thrown
into
such
disorder
that
being
moreover
encumbered
with
the
spoils
of
that
great
sack
and
some
of
them
desirous
of
enjoying
the
fruits
of
their
labour
they
oftentimes
showed
a
mind
to
mutiny
and
take
themselves
away
from
rome
however
after
coming
to
terms
with
their
valiant
captain
gian
di
urbino
they
were
ultimately
compelled
at
their
excessive
inconvenience
to
take
another
road
when
they
changed
guard
it
cost
them
three
miles
of
march
whereas
before
they
had
but
half
a
mile
having
achieved
this
feat
i
was
entreated
with
prodigious
favours
by
all
the
men
of
quality
who
were
invested
in
the
castle
this
incident
was
so
important
that
i
thought
it
well
to
relate
it
before
finishing
the
history
of
things
outside
my
art
the
which
is
the
real
object
of
my
writing
forsooth
if
i
wanted
to
ornament
my
biography
with
such
matters
i
should
have
far
too
much
to
tell
there
is
only
one
more
circumstance
which
now
that
the
occasion
offers
i
propose
to
record
note
the
mastio
or
main
body
of
mausoleum
which
was
converted
into
a
fortress
during
the
middle
ages
note
messo
la
spada
dinanzi
perhaps
bearing
his
sword
in
front
of
him
note
the
cannon
being
like
tubes
to
blow
a
fire
up
note
this
captain
was
a
spaniard
who
played
a
very
considerable
figure
in
the
war
distinguishing
himself
at
the
capture
of
genoa
and
the
battle
of
lodi
in
and
afterwards
acting
as
to
the
prince
of
orange
he
held
naples
against
orazio
baglioni
in
and
died
before
spello
in
xxxviii
i
shall
skip
over
some
intervening
circumstances
and
tell
how
pope
clement
wishing
to
save
the
tiaras
and
the
whole
collection
of
the
great
jewels
of
the
apostolic
camera
had
me
called
and
shut
himself
up
together
with
me
and
the
cavalierino
in
a
room
alone
this
cavalierino
had
been
a
groom
in
the
stable
of
filippo
strozzi
he
was
french
and
a
person
of
the
lowest
birth
but
being
a
most
faithful
servant
the
pope
had
made
him
very
rich
and
confided
in
him
like
himself
so
the
pope
the
cavaliere
and
i
being
shut
up
together
they
laid
before
me
the
tiaras
and
jewels
of
the
regalia
and
his
holiness
ordered
me
to
take
all
the
gems
out
of
their
gold
settings
this
i
accordingly
did
afterwards
i
wrapt
them
separately
up
in
bits
of
paper
and
we
sewed
them
into
the
linings
of
the
and
the
clothes
then
they
gave
me
all
the
gold
which
weighed
about
two
hundred
pounds
and
bade
me
melt
it
down
as
secretly
as
i
was
able
i
went
up
to
the
angel
where
i
had
my
lodging
and
could
lock
the
door
so
as
to
be
free
from
interruption
there
i
built
a
little
of
bricks
with
a
largish
pot
shaped
like
an
open
dish
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
throwing
the
gold
upon
the
coals
it
gradually
sank
through
and
dropped
into
the
pan
while
the
furnace
was
working
i
never
left
off
watching
how
to
annoy
our
enemies
and
as
their
trenches
were
less
than
a
right
below
us
i
was
able
to
inflict
considerable
damage
on
them
with
some
useless
missiles
of
which
there
were
several
piles
forming
the
old
munition
of
the
castle
i
chose
a
swivel
and
a
falconet
which
were
both
a
little
damaged
in
the
muzzle
and
filled
them
with
the
projectiles
i
have
mentioned
when
i
fired
my
guns
they
hurtled
down
like
mad
occasioning
all
sorts
of
unexpected
mischief
in
the
trenches
accordingly
i
kept
these
pieces
always
going
at
the
same
time
that
the
gold
was
being
melted
down
and
a
little
before
vespers
i
noticed
some
one
coming
along
the
margin
of
the
trench
on
muleback
the
mule
was
trotting
very
quickly
and
the
man
was
talking
to
the
soldiers
in
the
trenches
i
took
the
precaution
of
discharging
my
artillery
just
before
he
came
immediately
opposite
and
so
making
a
good
calculation
i
hit
my
mark
one
of
the
fragments
struck
him
in
the
face
the
rest
were
scattered
on
the
mule
which
fell
dead
a
tremendous
uproar
rose
up
from
the
trench
i
opened
fire
with
my
other
piece
doing
them
great
hurt
the
man
turned
out
to
be
the
prince
of
orange
who
was
carried
through
the
trenches
to
a
certain
tavern
in
the
neighbourhood
whither
in
a
short
while
all
the
chief
folk
of
the
army
came
together
when
pope
clement
heard
what
i
had
done
he
sent
at
once
to
call
for
me
and
inquired
into
the
circumstance
i
related
the
whole
and
added
that
the
man
must
have
been
of
the
greatest
consequence
because
the
inn
to
which
they
carried
him
had
been
immediately
filled
by
all
the
chiefs
of
the
army
so
far
at
least
as
i
could
judge
the
pope
with
a
shrewd
instinct
sent
for
messer
antonio
santacroce
the
nobleman
who
as
i
have
said
was
chief
and
commander
of
the
gunners
he
bade
him
order
all
us
bombardiers
to
point
our
pieces
which
were
very
numerous
in
one
mass
upon
the
house
and
to
discharge
them
all
together
upon
the
signal
of
an
arquebuse
being
fired
he
judged
that
if
we
killed
the
generals
the
army
which
was
already
almost
on
the
point
of
breaking
up
would
take
flight
god
perhaps
had
heard
the
prayers
they
kept
continually
making
and
meant
to
rid
them
in
this
manner
of
those
impious
scoundrels
we
put
our
cannon
in
order
at
the
command
of
santacroce
and
waited
for
the
signal
but
when
cardinal
orsini
became
aware
of
what
was
going
forward
he
began
to
expostulate
with
the
pope
protesting
that
the
thing
by
no
means
ought
to
happen
seeing
they
were
on
the
point
of
concluding
an
accommodation
and
that
if
the
generals
were
killed
the
rabble
of
the
troops
without
a
leader
would
storm
the
castle
and
complete
their
utter
ruin
consequently
they
could
by
no
means
allow
the
plan
to
be
carried
out
the
poor
pope
in
despair
seeing
himself
assassinated
both
inside
the
castle
and
without
said
that
he
left
them
to
arrange
it
on
this
our
orders
were
countermanded
but
i
who
chafed
against
the
leash
when
i
knew
that
they
were
coming
round
to
bid
me
stop
from
firing
let
blaze
one
of
my
and
struck
a
pillar
in
the
courtyard
of
the
house
around
which
i
saw
a
crowd
of
people
clustering
this
shot
did
such
damage
to
the
enemy
that
it
was
like
to
have
made
them
evacuate
the
house
cardinal
orsini
was
absolutely
for
having
me
hanged
or
put
to
death
but
the
pope
took
up
my
cause
with
spirit
the
high
words
that
passed
between
them
though
i
well
know
what
they
were
i
will
not
here
relate
because
i
make
no
profession
of
writing
history
it
is
enough
for
me
to
occupy
myself
with
my
own
affairs
note
this
personage
can
not
be
identified
the
filippo
strozzi
mentioned
as
having
been
his
master
was
the
great
opponent
of
the
medicean
despotism
who
killed
himself
in
prison
after
the
defeat
of
montemurlo
in
he
married
in
early
life
a
daughter
of
piero
medici
note
note
franciotto
orsini
was
educated
in
the
household
of
his
kinsman
lorenzo
medici
he
followed
the
profession
of
arms
and
married
but
after
losing
his
wife
took
orders
and
received
the
hat
in
note
che
non
potevo
stare
alle
mosse

after
i
had
melted
down
the
gold
i
took
it
to
the
pope
who
thanked
me
cordially
for
what
i
had
done
and
ordered
the
cavalierino
to
give
me
crowns
apologising
to
me
for
his
inability
to
give
me
more
a
few
days
afterwards
the
articles
of
peace
were
signed
i
went
with
three
hundred
comrades
in
the
train
of
signor
orazio
baglioni
toward
perugia
and
there
he
wished
to
make
me
captain
of
the
company
but
i
was
unwilling
at
the
moment
saying
that
i
wanted
first
to
go
and
see
my
father
and
to
redeem
the
ban
which
was
still
in
force
against
me
at
florence
signor
orazio
told
me
that
he
had
been
appointed
general
of
the
florentines
and
sir
pier
maria
del
lotto
the
envoy
from
florence
was
with
him
to
whom
he
specially
recommended
me
as
his
man
in
course
of
time
i
came
to
florence
in
the
company
of
several
comrades
the
plague
was
raging
with
indescribable
fury
when
i
reached
home
i
found
my
good
father
who
thought
either
that
i
must
have
been
killed
in
the
sack
of
rome
or
else
that
i
should
come
back
to
him
a
beggar
however
i
entirely
defeated
both
these
expectations
for
i
was
alive
with
plenty
of
money
a
fellow
to
wait
on
me
and
a
good
horse
my
joy
on
greeting
the
old
man
was
so
intense
that
while
he
embraced
and
kissed
me
i
thought
that
i
must
die
upon
the
spot
after
i
had
narrated
all
the
devilries
of
that
dreadful
sack
and
had
given
him
a
good
quantity
of
crowns
which
i
had
gained
by
my
soldiering
and
when
we
had
exchanged
our
tokens
of
affection
he
went
off
to
the
eight
to
redeem
my
ban
it
so
happened
that
one
of
those
magistrates
who
sentenced
me
was
now
again
a
member
of
the
board
it
was
the
very
man
who
had
so
inconsiderately
told
my
father
he
meant
to
march
me
out
into
the
country
with
the
lances
my
father
took
this
opportunity
of
addressing
him
with
some
meaning
words
in
order
to
mark
his
revenge
relying
on
the
favour
which
orazio
baglioni
showed
me
matters
standing
thus
i
told
my
father
how
signor
orazio
had
appointed
me
captain
and
that
i
ought
to
begin
to
think
of
enlisting
my
company
at
these
words
the
poor
old
man
was
greatly
disturbed
and
begged
me
for
sake
not
to
turn
my
thoughts
to
such
an
enterprise
although
he
knew
i
should
be
fit
for
this
or
yet
a
greater
business
adding
that
his
other
son
my
brother
was
already
a
most
valiant
soldier
and
that
i
ought
to
pursue
the
noble
art
in
which
i
had
laboured
so
many
years
and
with
such
diligence
of
study
although
i
promised
to
obey
him
he
reflected
like
a
man
of
sense
that
if
signor
orazio
came
to
florence
i
could
not
withdraw
myself
from
military
service
partly
because
i
had
passed
my
word
as
well
as
for
other
reasons
he
therefore
thought
of
a
good
expedient
for
sending
me
away
and
spoke
to
me
as
follows
my
dear
son
the
plague
in
this
town
is
raging
with
immitigable
violence
and
i
am
always
fancying
you
will
come
home
infected
with
it
i
remember
when
i
was
a
young
man
that
i
went
to
mantua
where
i
was
very
kindly
received
and
stayed
there
several
years
i
pray
and
command
you
for
the
love
of
me
to
pack
off
and
go
thither
and
i
would
have
you
do
this
rather
than
note
pier

to

he
collected
the
remnants
of

and
gave
them
over
to
orazio
baglioni
who
contrived
to
escape
from
angelo
in
safety
to
perugia
xl
i
had
always
taken
pleasure
in
seeing
the
world
and
having
never
been
in
mantua
i
went
there
very
willingly
of
the
money
i
had
brought
to
florence
i
left
the
greater
part
with
my
good
father
promising
to
help
him
wherever
i
might
be
and
confiding
him
to
the
care
of
my
elder
sister
her
name
was
cosa
and
since
she
never
cared
to
marry
she
was
admitted
as
a
nun
in
santa
orsola
but
she
put
off
taking
the
veil
in
order
to
keep
house
for
our
old
father
and
to
look
after
my
younger
sister
who
was
married
to
one
bartolommeo
a
surgeon
so
then
leaving
home
with
my
blessing
i
mounted
my
good
horse
and
rode
off
on
it
to
mantua
it
would
take
too
long
to
describe
that
little
journey
in
detail
the
whole
world
being
darkened
over
with
plague
and
war
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
reaching
mantua
however
in
the
end
i
got
there
and
looked
about
for
work
to
do
which
i
obtained
from
a
maestro
niccolň
of
milan
goldsmith
to
the
duke
of
mantua
having
thus
settled
down
to
work
i
went
after
two
days
to
visit
messer
giulio
romano
that
most
excellent
painter
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
and
my
very
good
friend
he
received
me
with
the
tenderest
caresses
and
took
it
very
ill
that
i
had
not
dismounted
at
his
house
he
was
living
like
a
lord
and
executing
a
great
work
for
the
duke
outside
the
city
gates
in
a
place
called
del
te
it
was
a
vast
and
prodigious
undertaking
as
may
still
i
suppose
be
seen
by
those
who
go
there
messer
giulio
lost
no
time
in
speaking
of
me
to
the
duke
in
terms
of
the
warmest
praise
that
prince
commissioned
me
to
make
a
model
for
a
reliquary
to
hold
the
blood
of
christ
which
they
have
there
and
say
was
brought
them
by
longinus
then
he
turned
to
giulio
bidding
him
supply
me
with
a
design
for
it
to
this
giulio
replied
lord
benvenuto
is
a
man
who
does
not
need
other
sketches
as
your
excellency
will
be
very
well
able
to
judge
when
you
shall
see
his
i
set
hand
to
the
work
and
made
a
drawing
for
the
reliquary
well
adapted
to
contain
the
sacred
phial
then
i
made
a
little
waxen
model
of
the
cover
this
was
a
seated
christ
supporting
his
great
cross
aloft
with
the
left
hand
while
he
seemed
to
lean
against
it
and
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
he
appeared
to
be
opening
the
wound
in
his
side
when
it
was
finished
it
pleased
the
duke
so
much
that
he
heaped
favours
on
me
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
would
keep
me
in
his
service
with
such
appointments
as
should
enable
me
to
live
in
affluence
meanwhile
i
had
paid
my
duty
to
the
cardinal
his
brother
who
begged
the
duke
to
allow
me
to
make
the
pontifical
seal
of
his
most
reverend
lordship
this
i
began
but
while
i
was
working
at
it
i
caught
a
quartan
fever
during
each
access
of
this
fever
i
was
thrown
into
delirium
when
i
cursed
mantua
and
its
master
and
whoever
stayed
there
at
his
own
liking
these
words
were
reported
to
the
duke
by
the
milanese
goldsmith
who
had
not
omitted
to
notice
that
the
duke
wanted
to
employ
me
when
the
prince
heard
the
ravings
of
my
sickness
he
flew
into
a
passion
against
me
and
i
being
out
of
temper
with
mantua
our
bad
feeling
was
reciprocal
the
seal
was
finished
after
four
months
together
with
several
other
little
pieces
i
made
for
the
duke
under
the
name
of
the
cardinal
his
reverence
paid
me
well
and
bade
me
return
to
rome
to
that
marvellous
city
where
we
had
made
acquaintance
i
quitted
mantua
with
a
good
sum
of
crowns
and
reached
governo
where
the
most
valiant
general
giovanni
had
been
killed
here
i
had
a
slight
relapse
of
fever
which
did
not
interrupt
my
journey
and
coming
now
to
an
end
it
never
returned
on
me
again
when
i
arrived
at
florence
i
hoped
to
find
my
dear
father
and
knocking
at
the
door
a
woman
in
a
fury
showed
her
face
at
the
window
she
drove
me
off
with
a
torrent
of
abuse
screaming
that
the
sight
of
me
was
a
consumption
to
her
to
this
misshapen
hag
i
shouted
tell
me
hunchback
is
there
no
other
face
to
see
here
but
your
ugly
visage
and
bad
luck
to
whereto
i
answered
in
a
loud
voice
less
than
two
hours
may
it
never
vex
us
more
attracted
by
this
dispute
a
neighbour
put
her
head
out
from
whom
i
learned
that
my
father
and
all
the
people
in
the
house
had
died
of
the
plague
as
i
had
partly
guessed
it
might
be
so
my
grief
was
not
so
great
as
it
would
otherwise
have
been
the
woman
afterwards
told
me
that
only
my
sister
liperata
had
escaped
and
that
she
had
taken
refuge
with
a
pious
lady
named
mona
andrea
bellacci
i
took
my
way
from
thence
to
the
inn
and
met
by
accident
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
giovanni
rigogli
dismounting
at
his
house
we
proceeded
to
the
piazza
where
i
received
intelligence
that
my
brother
was
alive
and
went
to
find
him
at
the
house
of
a
friend
of
his
called
bertino
aldobrandini
on
meeting
we
made
demonstrations
of
the
most
passionate
affection
for
he
had
heard
that
i
was
dead
and
i
had
heard
that
he
was
dead
and
so
our
joy
at
embracing
one
another
was
extravagant
then
he
broke
out
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
and
said
brother
i
will
take
you
where
sure
never
guess
you
must
know
that
i
have
given
our
sister
liperata
away
again
in
marriage
and
she
holds
it
for
absolutely
certain
that
you
are
on
our
way
we
told
each
other
all
the
wonderful
adventures
we
had
met
with
and
when
we
reached
the
house
where
our
sister
dwelt
the
surprise
of
seeing
me
alive
threw
her
into
a
fainting
fit
and
she
fell
senseless
in
my
arms
had
not
my
brother
been
present
her
speechlessness
and
sudden
seizure
must
have
made
her
husband
imagine
i
was
some
one
different
from
a
indeed
at
first
it
did
cecchino
however
explained
matters
and
busied
himself
in
helping
the
swooning
woman
who
soon
come
to
then
after
shedding
some
tears
for
father
sister
husband
and
a
little
son
whom
she
had
lost
she
began
to
get
the
supper
ready
and
during
our
merry
meeting
all
that
evening
we
talked
no
more
about
dead
folk
but
rather
discoursed
gaily
about
weddings
thus
then
with
gladness
and
great
enjoyment
we
brought
our
to
an
end

on
the
entreaty
of
my

and
sister
i
remained
at

though
my
own
inclination
led
me
to
return
to
rome
the
dear
friend
also
who
had
helped
me
in
some
of
my
earlier
troubles
as
i
have
narrated
i
mean
piero
son
of
giovanni
landi
too
advised
me
to
make
some
stay
in
florence
for
the
medici
were
in
exile
that
is
to
say
signor
ippolito
and
signor
alessandro
who
were
afterwards
respectively
cardinal
and
duke
of
florence
and
he
judged
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
wait
and
see
what
happened
at
that
time
there
arrived
in
florence
a
sienese
called
girolamo
marretti
who
had
lived
long
in
turkey
and
was
a
man
of
lively
intellect
he
came
to
my
shop
and
commissioned
me
to
make
a
golden
medal
to
be
worn
in
the
hat
the
subject
was
to
be
hercules
wrenching
the
mouth
while
i
was
working
at
this
piece
michel
agnolo
buonarroti
came
oftentimes
to
see
it
i
had
spent
infinite
pains
upon
the
design
so
that
the
attitude
of
the
figure
and
the
fierce
passion
of
the
beast
were
executed
in
quite
a
different
style
from
that
of
any
craftsman
who
had
hitherto
attempted
such
groups
this
together
with
the
fact
that
the
special
branch
of
art
was
totally
unknown
to
michel
agnolo
made
the
divine
master
give
such
praises
to
my
work
that
i
felt
incredibly
inspired
for
further
effort
however
i
found
little
else
to
do
but
and
though
i
gained
more
thus
than
in
any
other
way
yet
i
was
dissatisfied
for
i
would
fain
have
been
employed
upon
some
higher
task
than
that
of
setting
precious
stones
just
then
i
met
with
federigo
ginori
a
young
man
of
a
very
lofty
spirit
he
had
lived
some
years
in
naples
and
being
endowed
with
great
charms
of
person
and
presence
had
been
the
lover
of
a
neapolitan
princess
he
wanted
to
have
a
medal
made
with
atlas
bearing
the
world
upon
his
shoulders
and
applied
to
michel
agnolo
for
a
design
michel
agnolo
made
this
answer
and
find
out
a
young
goldsmith
named
benvenuto
he
will
serve
you
admirably
and
certainly
he
does
not
stand
in
need
of
sketches
by
me
however
to
prevent
your
thinking
that
i
want
to
save
myself
the
trouble
of
so
slight
a
matter
i
will
gladly
sketch
you
something
but
meanwhile
speak
to
benvenuto
and
let
him
also
make
a
model
he
can
then
execute
the
better
of
the
two
federigo
ginori
came
to
me
and
told
me
what
he
wanted
adding
thereto
how
michel
agnolo
had
praised
me
and
how
he
had
suggested
i
should
make
a
waxen
model
while
he
undertook
to
supply
a
sketch
the
words
of
that
great
man
so
heartened
me
that
i
set
myself
to
work
at
once
with
eagerness
upon
the
model
and
when
i
had
finished
it
a
painter
who
was
intimate
with
michel
agnolo
called
giuliano
bugiardini
brought
me
the
drawing
of
atlas
on
the
same
occasion
i
showed
giuliano
my
little
model
in
wax
which
was
very
different
from
michel
drawing
and
federigo
in
concert
with
bugiardini
agreed
that
i
should
work
upon
my
model
so
i
took
it
in
hand
and
when
michel
agnolo
saw
it
he
praised
me
to
the
skies
this
was
a
figure
as
i
have
said
chiselled
on
a
plate
of
gold
atlas
had
the
heaven
upon
his
back
made
out
of
a
crystal
ball
engraved
with
the
zodiac
upon
a
field
of
the
whole
composition
produced
an
indescribably
fine
effect
and
under
it
ran
the
legend
tulisse
juvat
federigo
was
so
thoroughly
well
pleased
that
he
paid
me
very
liberally
aluigi
alamanni
was
at
that
time
in
florence
federigo
ginori
who
enjoyed
his
friendship
brought
him
often
to
my
workshop
and
through
this
introduction
we
became
very
intimate
together
note
i
may
remind
my
readers
that
the
three
medici
of
the
ruling
house
were
now
illegitimate
clement

was
the
bastard
son
of

was
the
reputed
bastard
of

became

of
florence
and
after
poisoning
his
cousin
cardinal
ippolito
was
murdered
by
a
distant
cousin
lorenzino
medici
in
this
way
the
male
line
of
lorenzo
the
magnificent
was
extinguished
note
this
painter
was
the
pupil
of
bertoldo
a
man
of
simple
manners
and
of
some
excellence
in
his
art
the
gallery
at
bologna
has
a
fine
specimen
of
his
painting
michel
agnolo
delighted
in
his
society
note
cellini
says
note
this
was
the
agreeable
didactic
poet
luigi
alamanni
who
had
to
fly
from
florence
after
a
conspiracy
against
cardinal
giulio
medici
in
he
could
never
reconcile
himself
to
the
medicean
tyranny
and
finally
took
refuge
in
france
where
he
was
honoured
by
françois
i
he
died
at
amboise
in
xlii
pope
clement
had
now
declared
war
upon
the
city
of
florence
which
thereupon
was
put
in
a
state
of
defence
and
the
militia
being
organised
in
each
quarter
of
the
town
i
too
received
orders
to
serve
in
my
turn
i
provided
myself
with
a
rich
outfit
and
went
about
with
the
highest
nobility
of
florence
who
showed
a
unanimous
desire
to
fight
for
the
defence
of
our
liberties
meanwhile
the
speeches
which
are
usual
upon
such
occasions
were
made
in
every
quarter
the
young
men
met
together
more
than
was
their
wont
and
everywhere
we
had
but
one
topic
of
conversation
it
happened
one
day
about
noon
that
a
crowd
of
tall
men
and
lusty
young
fellows
the
first
in
the
city
were
assembled
in
my
workshop
when
a
letter
from
rome
was
put
into
my
hands
it
came
from
a
man
called
maestro
giacopino
della
barca
his
real
name
was
giacopo
della
sciorina
but
they
called
him
della
barca
in
rome
because
he
kept
a
ferry
boat
upon
the
tiber
between
ponte
sisto
and
ponte
santo
agnolo
he
was
a
person
of
considerable
talent
distinguished
by
his
pleasantries
and
striking
conversation
and
he
had
formerly
been
a
designer
of
patterns
for
the
in
florence
this
man
was
intimate
with
the
pope
who
took
great
pleasure
in
hearing
him
talk
being
one
day
engaged
in
conversation
they
touched
upon
the
sack
and
the
defence
of
the
castle
this
brought
me
to
the
mind
and
he
spoke
of
me
in
the
very
highest
terms
adding
that
if
he
knew
where
i
was
he
should
be
glad
to
get
me
back
maestro
giacopo
said
i
was
in
florence
whereupon
the
pope
bade
the
man
write
and
tell
me
to
return
to
him
the
letter
i
have
mentioned
was
to
the
effect
that
i
should
do
well
if
i
resumed
the
service
of
clement
and
that
this
was
sure
to
turn
out
to
my
advantage
the
young
men
who
were
present
were
curious
to
know
what
the
letter
contained
wherefore
i
concealed
it
as
well
as
i
could
afterwards
i
wrote
to
maestro
giacopo
begging
him
by
no
means
whether
for
good
or
evil
to
write
to
me
again
he
however
grew
more
obstinate
in
his
officiousness
and
wrote
me
another
letter
so
extravagantly
worded
that
if
it
had
been
seen
i
should
have
got
into
serious
trouble
the
substance
of
it
was
that
the
pope
required
me
to
come
at
once
wanting
to
employ
me
on
work
of
the
greatest
consequence
also
that
if
i
wished
to
act
aright
i
ought
to
throw
up
everything
and
not
to
stand
against
a
pope
in
the
party
of
those
radicals
this
letter
when
i
read
it
put
me
in
such
a
fright
that
i
went
to
seek
my
dear
friend
piero
landi
directly
he
set
eyes
on
me
he
asked
what
accident
had
happened
to
upset
me
so
i
told
my
friend
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
me
to
explain
what
lay
upon
my
mind
and
what
was
causing
me
this
trouble
only
i
entreated
him
to
take
the
keys
i
gave
him
and
to
return
the
gems
and
gold
in
my
drawers
to
such
and
such
persons
whose
names
he
would
find
inscribed
upon
my
next
i
begged
him
to
pack
up
the
furniture
of
my
house
and
keep
account
of
it
with
his
usual
and
in
a
few
days
he
should
hear
where
i
was
the
prudent
young
man
guessing
perhaps
pretty
nearly
how
the
matter
stood
replied
brother
go
your
was
quickly
then
write
to
me
and
have
no
further
care
about
your
i
did
as
he
advised
he
was
the
most
loyal
friend
the
wisest
the
most
worthy
the
most
discreet
the
most
affectionate
that
i
have
ever
known
i
left
florence
and
went
to
rome
and
from
there
i
wrote
to
him
note
quelle
orazioni
it
may
mean
prayers
were
offered
xliii
upon
my
arrival
in
rome
i
found
several
of
my
former
friends
by
whom
i
was
very
well
received
and
kindly
entertained
no
time
was
lost
before
i
set
myself
to
work
at
things
which
brought
me
profit
but
were
not
notable
enough
to
be
described
there
was
a
fine
old
man
a
goldsmith
called
raffaello
del
moro
who
had
considerable
reputation
in
the
trade
and
was
to
boot
a
very
worthy
fellow
he
begged
me
to
consent
to
enter
his
workshop
saying
he
had
some
commissions
of
importance
to
execute
on
which
high
profits
might
be
looked
for
so
i
accepted
his
proposal
with
goodwill
more
than
ten
days
had
elapsed
and
i
had
not
presented
myself
to
maestro
giacopino
della
barca
meeting
me
one
day
by
accident
he
gave
me
a
hearty
welcome
and
asked
me
how
long
i
had
been
in
rome
when
i
told
him
i
had
been
there
about
a
fortnight
he
took
it
very
ill
and
said
that
i
showed
little
esteem
for
a
pope
who
had
urgently
compelled
him
to
write
three
times
for
me
i
who
had
taken
his
persistence
in
the
matter
still
more
ill
made
no
reply
but
swallowed
down
my
irritation
the
man
who
suffered
from
a
flux
of
words
began
one
of
his
long
yarns
and
went
on
talking
till
at
the
last
when
i
saw
him
tired
out
i
merely
said
that
he
might
bring
me
to
the
pope
when
he
saw
fit
he
answered
that
any
time
would
do
for
him
and
i
that
i
was
always
ready
so
we
took
our
way
toward
the
palace
it
was
a
maundy
thursday
and
when
we
reached
the
apartments
of
the
pope
he
being
known
there
and
i
expected
we
were
at
once
admitted
the
pope
was
in
bed
suffering
from
a
slight
indisposition
and
he
had
with
him
messer
jacopo
salviati
and
the
archbishop
of
capua
when
the
pope
set
eyes
on
me
he
was
exceedingly
glad
i
kissed
his
feet
and
then
as
humbly
as
i
could
drew
near
to
him
and
let
him
understand
that
i
had
things
of
consequence
to
utter
on
this
he
waved
his
hand
and
the
two
prelates
retired
to
a
distance
from
us
i
began
at
once
to
speak
blessed
father
from
the
time
of
the
sack
up
to
this
hour
i
have
never
been
able
to
confess
or
to
communicate
because
they
refuse
me
absolution
the
case
is
this
when
i
melted
down
the
gold
and
worked
at
the
unsetting
of
those
jewels
your
holiness
ordered
the
cavalierino
to
give
me
a
modest
reward
for
my
labours
of
which
i
received
nothing
but
on
the
contrary
he
rather
paid
me
with
abuse
when
then
i
ascended
to
the
chamber
where
i
had
melted
down
the
gold
and
washed
the
ashes
i
found
about
a
pound
and
a
half
of
gold
in
tiny
grains
like
and
inasmuch
as
i
had
not
money
enough
to
take
me
home
respectably
i
thought
i
would
avail
myself
of
this
and
give
it
back
again
when
opportunity
should
offer
now
i
am
here
at
the
feet
of
your
holiness
who
is
the
only
true
confessor
i
entreat
you
to
do
me
the
favour
of
granting
me
indulgence
so
that
i
may
be
able
to
confess
and
communicate
and
by
the
grace
of
your
holiness
regain
the
grace
of
my
lord
upon
this
the
pope
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
sigh
remembering
perhaps
his
former
trials
spoke
as
follows
i
thoroughly
believe
what
you
tell
me
it
is
in
my
power
to
absolve
you
of
any
unbecoming
deed
you
may
have
done
and
what
is
more
i
have
the
will
so
then
speak
out
with
frankness
and
perfect
confidence
for
if
you
had
taken
the
value
of
a
whole
tiara
i
am
quite
ready
to
pardon
thereupon
i
answered
took
nothing
most
blessed
father
but
what
i
have
confessed
and
this
did
not
amount
to
the
value
of
ducats
for
that
was
the
sum
i
received
from
the
mint
in
perugia
and
with
it
i
went
home
to
comfort
my
poor
old
the
pope
said
father
has
been
as
virtuous
good
and
worthy
a
man
as
was
ever
born
and
you
have
not
degenerated
from
him
i
am
very
sorry
that
the
money
was
so
little
but
such
as
you
say
it
was
i
make
you
a
present
of
it
and
give
you
my
full
pardon
assure
your
confessor
of
this
if
there
is
nothing
else
upon
your
conscience
which
concerns
me
afterwards
when
you
have
confessed
and
communicated
you
shall
present
yourself
to
me
again
and
it
will
be
to
your
when
i
parted
from
the
pope
messer
giacopo
and
the
archbishop
approached
and
the
pope
spoke
to
them
in
the
highest
terms
imaginable
about
me
he
said
that
he
had
confessed
and
absolved
me
then
he
commissioned
the
archbishop
of
capua
to
send
for
me
and
ask
if
i
had
any
other
need
beyond
this
matter
giving
him
full
leave
to
absolve
me
amply
and
bidding
him
moreover
treat
me
with
the
utmost
kindness
while
i
was
walking
away
with
maestro
giacopino
he
asked
me
very
inquisitively
what
was
the
close
and
lengthy
conversation
i
had
had
with
his
holiness
after
he
had
repeated
the
question
more
than
twice
i
said
that
i
did
not
mean
to
tell
him
because
they
were
matters
with
which
he
had
nothing
to
do
and
therefore
he
need
not
go
on
asking
me
then
i
went
to
do
what
had
been
agreed
on
with
the
pope
and
after
the
two
festivals
were
over
i
again
presented
myself
before
his
holiness
he
received
me
even
better
than
before
and
said
you
had
come
a
little
earlier
to
rome
i
should
have
commissioned
you
to
restore
my
two
tiaras
which
were
pulled
to
pieces
in
the
castle
these
however
with
the
exception
of
the
gems
are
objects
of
little
artistic
interest
so
i
will
employ
you
on
a
piece
of
the
very
greatest
consequence
where
you
will
be
able
to
exhibit
all
your
talents
it
is
a
button
for
my
cope
which
has
to
be
made
round
like
a
trencher
and
as
big
as
a
little
trencher
of
a
cubit
wide
upon
this
i
want
you
to
represent
a
god
the
father
in
and
in
the
middle
to
set
that
magnificent
big
diamond
which
you
remember
together
with
several
other
gems
of
the
greatest
value
caradosso
began
to
make
me
one
but
did
not
finish
it
i
want
yours
to
be
finished
quickly
so
that
i
may
enjoy
the
use
of
it
a
little
while
go
then
and
make
me
a
fine
he
had
all
the
jewels
shown
me
and
then
i
went
off
like
a
shot
to
set
myself
to
work

been
severely
taxed
for
leaving
florence
at
this
juncture
and
taking
service
under
pope
clement
the
oppressor
of
her
liberties
his
own
narrative
admits
some
sense
of
shame
yet
we
should
remember
that
he
never
took
any
decided
part
in
politics
and
belonged
to
a
family
of
medicean
sympathies
his
father
served
lorenzo
and
piero
his
brother
was
a
soldier
of
giovanni
delle

and

alessandro
many
most
excellent
florentines
were
convinced
that
the
medicean
government
was
beneficial
and
an
artist
had
certainly
more
to
expect
from
it
than
from
the
republic

who
after
a
little
while
took
it
to
present
in
person
to
francis
king
of
france
accompanied
by
some
of
his
own
finest
compositions
the
king
was
exceedingly
delighted
with
the
gift
whereupon
messer
luigi
told
his
majesty
so
much
about
my
personal
qualities
as
well
as
my
art
and
spoke
so
favourably
that
the
king
expressed
a
wish
to
know
me
meanwhile
i
pushed
my
model
for
the
button
forward
with
all
the
diligence
i
could
constructing
it
exactly
of
the
size
which
the
jewel
itself
was
meant
to
have
in
the
trade
of
the
goldsmiths
it
roused
considerable
jealousy
among
those
who
thought
that
they
were
capable
of
matching
it
a
certain
micheletto
had
just
come
to
rome
he
was
very
clever
at
engraving
cornelians
and
was
moreover
a
most
intelligent
jeweller
an
old
man
and
of
great
celebrity
he
had
been
employed
upon
the
tiaras
and
while
i
was
working
at
my
model
he
wondered
much
that
i
had
not
applied
to
him
being
as
he
was
a
man
of
intelligence
and
of
large
credit
with
the
pope
at
last
when
he
saw
that
i
was
not
coming
to
him
he
came
to
me
and
asked
me
what
i
was
about
the
pope
has
ordered
me
i
answered
then
he
said
pope
has
commissioned
me
to
superintend
everything
which
is
being
made
for
his
i
only
replied
that
i
would
ask
the
pope
and
then
should
know
what
answer
i
ought
to
give
him
he
told
me
that
i
should
repent
and
departing
in
anger
had
an
interview
with
all
the
masters
of
the
art
they
deliberated
on
the
matter
and
charged
michele
with
the
conduct
of
the
whole
affair
as
was
to
be
expected
from
a
person
of
his
talents
he
ordered
more
than
thirty
drawings
to
be
made
all
differing
in
their
details
for
the
piece
the
pope
had
commissioned
having
already
access
to
his
ear
he
took
into
his
counsel
another
jeweller
named
pompeo
a
milanese
who
was
in
favour
with
the
pope
and
related
to
messer
traiano
the
first
chamberlain
of
the
court
these
two
together
then
began
to
insinuate
that
they
had
seen
my
model
and
did
not
think
me
up
to
a
work
of
such
extraordinary
import
the
pope
replied
that
he
would
also
have
to
see
it
and
that
if
he
then
found
me
unfit
for
the
purpose
he
should
look
around
for
one
who
was
fit
both
of
them
put
in
that
they
had
several
excellent
designs
ready
to
which
the
pope
made
answer
that
he
was
very
pleased
to
hear
it
but
that
he
did
not
care
to
look
at
them
till
i
had
completed
my
model
afterwards
he
would
take
them
all
into
consideration
at
the
same
time
after
a
few
days
i
finished
my
model
and
took
it
to
the
pope
one
morning
when
messer
traiano
made
me
wait
till
he
had
sent
for
micheletto
and
pompeo
bidding
them
make
haste
and
bring
their
drawings
on
their
arrival
we
were
introduced
and
micheletto
and
pompeo
immediately
unrolled
their
papers
which
the
pope
inspected
the
draughtsmen
who
had
been
employed
were
not
in
the
trade
and
therefore
knew
nothing
about
giving
their
right
place
to
precious
stones
and
the
jewellers
on
their
side
had
not
shown
them
how
for
i
ought
to
say
that
a
jeweller
when
he
has
to
work
with
figures
must
of
necessity
understand
design
else
he
can
not
produce
anything
worth
looking
at
and
so
it
turned
out
that
all
of
them
had
stuck
that
famous
diamond
in
the
middle
of
the
breast
of
god
the
father
the
pope
who
was
an
excellent
connoisseur
observing
this
mistake
approved
of
none
of
them
and
when
he
had
looked
at
about
ten
he
flung
the
rest
down
and
said
to
me
who
was
standing
at
a
distance
show
me
your
model
benvenuto
so
that
i
may
see
if
you
have
made
the
same
mistake
as
those
i
came
forward
and
opened
a
little
round
box
whereupon
one
would
have
thought
that
a
light
from
heaven
had
struck
the
eyes
he
cried
aloud
you
had
been
in
my
own
body
you
could
not
have
done
it
better
as
this
proves
those
men
there
have
found
the
right
way
to
bring
shame
upon
themselves
a
crowd
of
great
lords
pressing
round
the
pope
pointed
out
the
difference
between
my
model
and
the
drawings
when
he
had
sufficiently
commended
it
the
others
standing
terrified
and
stupid
before
him
he
turned
to
me
and
said
am
only
afraid
of
one
thing
and
that
is
of
the
utmost
consequence
friend
benvenuto
wax
is
easy
to
work
in
the
real
difficulty
is
to
execute
this
in
to
those
words
i
answered
without
hesitation
blessed
father
if
i
do
not
work
it
ten
times
better
than
the
model
let
it
be
agreed
beforehand
that
you
pay
me
when
they
heard
this
the
noblemen
made
a
great
stir
crying
out
that
i
was
promising
too
much
among
them
was
an
eminent
philosopher
who
spoke
out
in
my
favour
the
fine
physiognomy
and
bodily
symmetry
which
i
observed
in
this
young
man
i
predict
that
he
will
accomplish
what
he
says
and
think
that
he
will
even
go
beyond
the
pope
put
in
this
is
my
opinion
then
he
called
his
chamberlain
messer
traiano
and
bade
him
bring
five
hundred
golden
ducats
of
the
camera
while
we
were
waiting
for
the
money
the
pope
turned
once
more
to
gaze
at
leisure
on
the
dexterous
device
i
had
employed
for
combining
the
diamond
with
the
figure
of
god
the
father
i
had
put
the
diamond
exactly
in
the
center
of
the
piece
and
above
it
god
the
father
was
shown
seated
leaning
nobly
in
a
sideways
attitude
which
made
a
perfect
composition
and
did
not
interfere
with
the
effect
lifting
his
right
hand
he
was
in
the
act
of
giving
the
benediction
below
the
diamond
i
had
place
three
children
who
with
their
arms
upraised
were
supporting
the
jewel
one
of
them
in
the
middle
was
in
full
relief
the
other
two
in
all
around
i
set
a
crowd
of
cherubs
in
divers
attitudes
adapted
to
the
other
gems
a
mantle
undulated
to
the
wind
around
the
figure
of
the
father
from
the
folds
of
which
cherubs
peeped
out
and
there
were
other
ornaments
besides
which
made
a
very
beautiful
effect
the
work
was
executed
in
white
stucco
on
a
black
stone
when
the
money
came
the
pope
gave
it
to
me
with
his
own
hand
and
begged
me
in
the
most
winning
terms
to
let
him
have
it
finished
in
his
own
days
adding
that
this
should
be
to
my
advantage

i
took
the
money
and
the
model
home
and
was
in
the
utmost
impatience
to
begin
my
work
after
i
had
laboured
diligently
for
eight
days
the
pope
sent
word
by
one
of
his
chamberlains
a
very
great
gentleman
of
bologna
that
i
was
to
come
to
him
and
bring
what
i
had
got
in
hand
on
the
way
the
chamberlain
who
was
the
most
person
in
the
roman
court
told
me
that
the
pope
not
only
wanted
to
see
what
i
was
doing
but
also
intended
to
intrust
me
with
another
task
of
the
highest
consequence
which
was
in
fact
to
furnish
dies
for
the
money
of
the
mint
and
bade
me
arm
myself
beforehand
with
the
answer
i
should
give
in
short
he
wished
me
to
be
prepared
and
therefore
he
had
spoken
when
we
came
into
the
presence
i
lost
no
time
in
exhibiting
the
golden
plate
upon
which
i
had
as
yet
carved
nothing
but
my
figure
of
god
the
father
but
this
though
only
in
the
rough
displayed
a
grander
style
than
that
of
the
waxen
model
the
pope
regarded
it
with
stupefaction
and
exclaimed
this
moment
forward
i
will
believe
everything
you
then
loading
me
with
marks
of
favour
he
added
is
my
intention
to
give
you
another
commission
which
if
you
feel
competent
to
execute
it
i
shall
have
no
less
at
heart
than
this
or
he
proceeded
to
tell
me
that
he
wished
to
make
dies
for
the
coinage
of
his
realm
and
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
tried
my
hand
at
such
things
and
if
i
had
the
courage
to
attempt
them
i
answered
that
of
courage
for
the
task
i
had
no
lack
and
that
i
had
seen
how
dies
were
made
but
that
i
had
not
ever
made
any
there
was
in
the
presence
a
certain
messer
tommaso
of
prato
his
datary
and
this
man
being
a
friend
of
my
enemies
put
in
blessed
father
the
favours
you
are
showering
upon
this
young
man
and
he
by
nature
so
extremely
overbold
are
enough
to
make
him
promise
you
a
new
world
you
have
already
given
him
one
great
task
and
now
by
adding
a
greater
you
are
like
to
make
them
clash
the
pope
in
a
rage
turned
round
on
him
and
told
him
to
mind
his
own
business
then
he
commanded
me
to
make
the
model
for
a
broad
doubloon
of
gold
upon
which
he
wanted
a
naked
christ
with
his
hands
tied
and
the
inscription
homo
the
reverse
was
to
have
a
pope
and
emperor
in
the
act
together
of
propping
up
a
cross
which
seemed
to
fall
and
this
legend

after
the
pope
had
ordered
this
handsome
coin
bandinello
the
sculptor
came
up
he
had
not
yet
been
made
a
knight
and
with
his
wonted
presumption
muffled
up
in
ignorance
said
these
goldsmiths
one
must
make
drawings
for
such
fine
things
as
i
turned
round
upon
him
in
a
moment
and
cried
out
that
i
did
not
want
his
drawings
for
my
art
but
that
i
hoped
before
very
long
to
give
his
art
some
trouble
by
my
drawings
the
pope
expressed
high
satisfaction
at
these
words
and
turning
to
me
said
then
my
benvenuto
and
devote
yourself
with
spirit
to
my
service
and
do
not
lend
an
ear
to
the
chattering
of
these
silly
so
i
went
off
and
very
quickly
made
two
dies
of
steel
then
i
stamped
a
coin
in
gold
and
one
sunday
after
dinner
took
the
coin
and
the
dies
to
the
pope
who
when
he
saw
the
piece
was
astonished
and
greatly
gratified
not
only
because
my
work
pleased
him
excessively
but
also
because
of
the
rapidity
with
which
i
had
performed
it
for
the
further
satisfaction
and
amazement
of
his
holiness
i
had
brought
with
me
all
the
old
coins
which
in
former
times
had
been
made
by
those
able
men
who
served
popes
giulio
and
leo
and
when
i
noticed
that
mine
pleased
him
far
better
i
drew
forth
from
my
bosom
a
patient
in
which
i
prayed
for
the
post
of
in
the
mint
this
place
was
worth
six
golden
crowns
a
month
in
addition
to
the
dies
which
were
paid
at
the
rate
of
a
ducat
for
three
by
the
master
of
the
mint
the

took
my
patent
and
handed
it
to

datary
telling
him
to
lose
no
time
in
dispatching
the
business
the
datary
began
to
put
it
in
his
pocket
saying
blessed
father
your
holiness
ought
not
to
go
so
fast
these
are
matters
which
deserve
some

the

heard
what
you
have
got
to
say
give
me
here
that
he
took
it
and
signed
it
at

with
his
own
hand
then
giving
it
back
added
you
have
no
answer
left

that
you
dispatch
it
at
once

this
is
my
pleasure

are

more

having

his
holiness

went

work

this
worthy
man
had
a
very
beautiful
young
daughter
with
regard
to
whom
he
had
designs
on
me
and
i
becoming
partly
aware
of
his
intentions
was
very
willing
but
while
indulging
such
desires
i
made
no
show
of
them
on
the
contrary
i
was
so
discreet
in
my
behaviour
that
i
made
him
wonder
it
so
happened
that
the
poor
girl
was
attacked
by
a
disorder
in
her
right
hand
which
ate
into
the
two
bones
belonging
to
the
little
finger
and
the
next
owing
to
her
carelessness
she
had
been
treated
by
an
ignorant
who
predicted
that
the
poor
child
would
be
crippled
in
the
whole
of
her
right
arm
if
even
nothing
worse
should
happen
when
i
noticed
the
dismay
of
her
father
i
begged
him
not
to
believe
all
that
this
ignorant
doctor
had
said
he
replied
that
he
had
no
acquaintance
with
physicians
or
with
surgeons
and
entreated
me
if
i
knew
of
one
to
bring
him
to
the
house
i
sent
at
once
for
a
certain
maestro
giacomo
of
perugia
a
man
of
great
skill
in
surgery
who
examined
the
poor
girl
she
was
dreadfully
frightened
through
having
gained
some
inkling
of
the
predictions
whereas
my
intelligent
doctor
declared
that
she
would
suffer
nothing
of
consequence
and
would
be
very
well
able
to
use
her
right
hand
also
that
though
the
two
last
fingers
must
remain
somewhat
weaker
than
the
others
this
would
be
of
no
inconvenience
at
all
to
her
so
he
began
his
treatment
and
after
a
few
days
when
he
was
going
to
extract
a
portion
of
the
diseased
bones
her
father
called
for
me
and
begged
me
to
be
present
at
the
operation
maestro
giacomo
was
using
some
coarse
steel
instruments
and
when
i
observed
that
he
was
making
little
way
and
at
the
same
time
was
inflicting
severe
pain
on
the
patient
i
begged
him
to
stop
and
wait
half
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
me
i
ran
into
the
shop
and
made
a
little
of
steel
extremely
thin
and
curved
it
cut
like
a
razor
on
my
return
the
surgeon
used
it
and
began
to
work
with
so
gentle
a
hand
that
she
felt
no
pain
and
in
a
short
while
the
operation
was
over
in
consequence
of
this
service
and
for
other
reasons
the
worthy
man
conceived
for
me
as
much
love
or
more
as
he
had
for
two
male
children
and
in
the
meanwhile

frequented

sleeping

then
the
guard

passed
by

were
taking
to
prison

had

had
a
way
of
putting
his
neighbours
to
the
push
not

to
hazard
his
own

so
finding
there
around
him
several
young
fellows
of
the
highest
daring
more
eager
than
apt
for
so
serious
an
enterprise
he
bade
them
catch
up

get
the
money
from
him

resisted
overpower

men

had
pluck
enough
to
do

bertino
had
been
trained
like
a
pupil
by
my
brother
and
my
brother
felt
the
most
unbounded
love
for
him

then
off
dashed
the
four
brave
lads
and
came
up
with
the
guard
of
the
of
fifty
constables
counting
pikes
arquebuses
and
after
a
few
words
they
drew
their
weapons
and
the
four
boys
so
harried
the
guard
that
if
captain
cattivanza
had
but
shown
his
face
without
so
much
as
drawing
they
would
certainly
have
put

than

commotion

of

rose
from

to
go
and
look
at

scuffle

go

is
always

spoke
to

go
but
the
lad
without
heeding
any
one
ran
down
the
stairs
reaching
the
banchi
where
the
great
scrimmage
was
and
seeing
bertino
lifted
from
the
ground
he
ran
towards
home
and
met
my
brother

on
the
way
who
asked
what
was
the
matter
though
some
of
the
bystanders
signed
to
giovanni
not
to
tell
cecchino
he
cried
out
like
a
madman
how
it
was
that
bertino
aldobrandi
had
been
killed
by
the
guard
my
poor
brother
gave
vent
to
a
bellow
which
might
have
been
heard
ten
miles
away
then
he
turned
to
giovanni
me
but
could
you
tell
me
which
of
those
men
killed
him
for
me

said
yes
that
it
was
a
man
who
had
a
big
sword
with
a
blue
feather
in
his
bonnet
my
poor
brother
rushed
ahead
and
having
recognised
the
homicide
by
those
signs
he
threw
himself
with
all
his
dash
and
spirit
into
the
middle
of
the
band
and
before
his
man
could
turn
on
guard
ran
him
right
through
the
guts
and
with
the
hilt
thrust
him
to
the
ground
then
he
turned
upon
the
rest
with
such
energy
and
daring
that
his
one
arm
was
on
the
point
of
putting
the
whole
band
to
flight

it
not
been
that
while
wheeling
round
to
strike
an
arquebusier
this
man
fired
in
and
hit
the
brave
unfortunate
young
fellow
above
the
knee
of
his
right
leg
while
he
lay
stretched
upon
the
ground
the
constables
scrambled
off
in
disorder
as
fast
as
they
were
able
lest
a
pair
to
my
brother
should
arrive
upon
the
scene
noticing
that
the
tumult
was
not
subsiding
i
too
rose
from
the
table
and
girding
on
my
everybody
wore
one
went
to
the
bridge
of

where
i
saw
a
group
of
several
men
assembled
on
my
coming
up
and
being
recognised
by
some
of
them
they
gave
way
before
me
and
showed
me
what
i
least
of
all
things
wished
to
see
albeit
i
made
mighty
haste
to
view
the
sight
on
the
instant
i
did
not
know
cecchino
since
he
was
wearing
a
different
suit
of
clothes
from
that
in
which
i
had
lately
seen
him
accordingly
he
recognised
me
first
and
said
brother
do
not
be
upset
by
my
grave
accident
it
is
only
what
might
be
expected
in
my
profession
get
me
removed
from
here
at
once
for
i
have
but
few
hours
to
they
had
acquainted
me
with
the
whole
event
while
he
was
speaking
in
brief
words
befitting
such
occasion
so
i
answered
this
is
the
greatest
sorrow
and
the
greatest
trial
that
could
happen
to
me

made

of

traversed

short
space
wrapped
in

tightened
round

came
up
with

i
should
most
certainly
have
murdered

were
plenty

people
round

cried
out
to

you
for

alone

you
he
asked
is
he

they
answered

to
the
man
you
see
without
waiting
to
hear
more
he
made
haste
for

they
said

prevented
you
against
your
will
but
did
it
for
your
good
now
let
us
go
to
succour

must

and

at

conveyed

house
the
doctors
who
were
called
in
consultation
treated
him
with
medicaments
but
could
not
decide
to
amputate
the
leg
which
might
perhaps
have
saved
him
as
soon
as
his
wound
had
been
dressed
duke
alessandro
appeared
and
most
affectionately
greeted
him
my
brother
had
not
as
yet
lost
consciousness
so
he
said
to
the
duke
lord
this
only
grieves
me
that
your
excellency
is
losing
a
servant
than
whom
you
may
perchance
find
men
more
valiant
in
the
profession
of
arms
but
none
more
lovingly
and
loyally
devoted
to
your
service
than
i
have
the
duke
bade
him
do
all
he
could
to
keep
alive
for
the
rest
he
well
knew
him
to
be
a
man
of
worth
and
courage
he
then
turned
to
his
attendants
ordering
them
to
see
that
the
brave
young
fellow
wanted
for
nothing
when
he
was
gone
my
brother
lost
blood
so
copiously
for
nothing
could
be
done
to
stop
it
that
he
went
off
his
head
and
kept
raving
all
the
following
night
with
the
exception
that
once
when
they
wanted
to
give
him
the
communion
he
said
would
have
done
well
to
confess
me
before
now
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
receive
the
divine
sacrament
in
this
already
ruined
frame
it
will
be
enough
if
i
partake
of
it
by
the
divine
virtue
of
the
eyesight
whereby
it
shall
be
transmitted
into
my
immortal
soul
which
only
prays
to
him
for
mercy
and
having
spoken
thus
the
host
was
elevated
but
he
straightway
relapsed
into
the
same
delirious
ravings
as
before
pouring
forth
a
torrent
of
the
most
terrible
frenzies
and
horrible
imprecations
that
the
mind
of
man
could
imagine
nor
did
he
cease
once
all
that
night
until
the
day
broke
when
the
sun
appeared
above
our
horizon
he
turned
to
me
and
said
i
do
not
wish
to
stay
here
longer
for
these
fellows
will
end
by
making
me
do
something
tremendous
which
may
cause
them
to
repent
of
the
annoyance
they
have
given
then
he
kicked
out
both
his
injured
limb
we
had
enclosed
in
a
very
heavy
made
as
though
he
would
fling
it
across
a
back
turning
his
face
round
to
me
he
called
out
farewell
and
with
the
last
word
that
most
valiant
spirit
passed
away
at
the
proper
hour
toward
nightfall
i
had
him
buried
with
due
ceremony
in
the
church
of
the
florentines
and
afterwards
i
erected
to
his
memory
a
very
handsome
monument
of
marble
upon
which
i
caused
trophies
and
banners
to
be
carved
i
must
not
omit
to
mention
that
one
of
his
friends
had
asked
him
who
the
man
was
that
had
killed
him
and
if
he
could
recognise
him
to
which
he
answered
that
he
could
and
gave
his
description
my
brother
indeed
attempted
to
prevent
this
coming
to
my
ears
but
i
got
it
very
well
impressed
upon
my
mind
as
will
appear
in
the
sequel
note
the
torre
di
nona
was
one
of
the
principal
prisons
in
rome
used
especially
for
criminals
condemned
to
death

account

also
bertino
aldobrandi
in
the
attempt
to
revenge
whom
he
lost
his
life
l
returning
to
the
monument
i
should
relate
that
certain
famous
men
of
letters
who
knew
my
brother
composed
for
me
an
epitaph
telling
me
that
the
noble
young
man
deserved
it
the
inscription
ran
thus

he
was
years
of
age
and
since
the
soldiers
called
him
cecchino
del
piffero
his
real
name
being
giovanfrancesco
cellini
i
wanted
to
engrave
the
former
by
which
he
was
commonly
known
under
the
armorial
bearings
of
our
family
this
name
then
i
had
cut
in
fine
antique
characters
all
of
which
were
broken
save
the
first
and
last
i
was
asked
by
the
learned
men
who
had
composed
that
beautiful
epitaph
wherefore
i
used
these
broken
letters
and
my
answer
was
because
the
marvellous
framework
of
his
body
was
spoiled
and
dead
and
the
reason
why
the
first
and
last
remained
entire
was
that
the
first
should
symbolise
the
great
gift
god
had
given
him
namely
of
a
human
soul
inflamed
with
his
divinity
the
which
hath
never
broken
while
the
second
represented
the
glorious
renown
of
his
brave
actions
the
thought
gave
satisfaction
and
several
persons
have
since
availed
themselves
of
my
device
close
to
the
name
i
had
the
coat
of
us
cellini
carved
upon
the
stone
altering
it
in
some
particulars
in
ravenna
which
is
a
most
ancient
city
there
exist
cellini
of
our
name
in
the
quality
of
very
honourable
gentry
who
bear
a
lion
rampant
or
upon
a
field
of
azure
holding
a
lily
gules
in
his
dexter
paw
with
a
label
in
chief
and
three
little
lilies
or
these
are
the
true
arms
of
the
cellini
my
father
showed
me
a
shield
as
ours
which
had
the
paw
only
together
with
the
other
bearings
but
i
should
prefer
to
follow
those
of
the
cellini
of
ravenna
which
i
have
described
above
now
to
return
to
what
i
caused
to
be
engraved
upon
my
tomb
it
was
the
paw
but
instead
of
a
lily
i
made
the
lion
hold
an
axe
with
the
field
of
the
scutcheon
quartered
and
i
put
the
axe
in
solely
that
i
might
not
be
unmindful
to
revenge
him
note
that
is
frank
the
son
note
i
believe
cellini
meant
here
to
write
a
chief
argent
a
label
of
four
points
and
three
lilies
he
has
tricked
the
arms
thus
in
a
of
the
palatine
library
see
leclanchč
see
also
piatti
vol
and
plon
li
i
went
on
applying
myself
with
the
utmost
diligence
upon
the
for
pope
button
he
was
very
eager
to
have
it
and
used
to
send
for
me
two
or
three
times
a
week
in
order
to
inspect
it
and
his
delight
in
the
work
always
increased
often
would
he
rebuke
and
scold
me
as
it
were
for
the
great
grief
in
which
my
loss
had
plunged
me
and
one
day
observing
me
more
downcast
and
out
of
trim
than
was
proper
he
cried
aloud
oh
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
mad
have
you
only
just
learned
that
there
is
no
remedy
against
death
one
would
think
that
you
were
trying
to
run
after
when
i
left
the
presence
i
continued
working
at
the
jewel
and
the
dies
for
the
mint
but
i
also
took
to
watching
the
arquebusier
who
shot
my
brother
as
though
he
had
been
a
girl
i
was
in
love
with
the
man
had
formerly
been
in
the
light
cavalry
but
afterwards
had
joined
the
arquebusiers
as
one
of
the
corporals
and
what
increased
my
rage
was
that
he
had
used
these
boastful
words
it
had
not
been
for
me
who
killed
that
brave
young
man
the
least
trifle
of
delay
would
have
resulted
in
his
putting
us
all
to
flight
with
great
when
i
saw
that
the
fever
caused
by
always
seeing
him
about
was
depriving
me
of
sleep
and
appetite
and
was
bringing
me
by
degrees
to
sorry
plight
i
overcame
my
repugnance
to
so
low
and
not
quite
praiseworthy
an
enterprise
and
made
my
mind
up
one
evening
to
rid
myself
of
the
torment
the
fellow
lived
in
a
house
near
a
place
called
torre
sanguigua
next
door
to
the
lodging
of
one
of
the
most
fashionable
courtesans
in
rome
named
signora
antea
it
had
just
struck
and
he
was
standing
at
the
with
his
sword
in
hand
having
risen
from
supper
with
great
address
i
stole
up
to
him
holding
a
large
pistojan
dagger
and
dealt
him
a
stroke
with
which
i
meant
to
cut
his
head
clean
off
but
as
he
turned
round
very
suddenly
the
blow
fell
upon
the
point
of
his
left
shoulder
and
broke
the
bone
he
sprang
up
dropped
his
sword
with
the
great
pain
and
took
to
flight
i
followed
after
and
in
four
steps
caught
him
up
when
i
lifted
my
dagger
above
his
head
which
he
was
holding
very
low
and
hit
him
in
the
back
exactly
at
the
juncture
of
the
and
the
neck
the
poniard
entered
this
point
so
deep
into
the
bone
that
though
i
used
all
my
strength
to
pull
it
out
i
was
not
able
for
just
at
that
moment
four
soldiers
with
drawn
swords
sprang
out
from
lodging
and
obliged
me
to
set
hand
to
my
own
sword
to
defend
my
life
leaving
the
poniard
then
i
made
off
and
fearing
i
might
be
recognised
took
refuge
in
the
palace
of
duke
alessandro
which
was
between
piazza
navona
and
the
rotunda
on
my
arrival
i
asked
to
see
the
duke
who
told
me
that
if
i
was
alone
i
need
only
keep
quiet
and
have
no
further
anxiety
but
to
go
on
working
at
the
jewel
which
the
pope
had
set
his
heart
on
and
stay
eight
days
indoors
he
gave
this
advice
the
more
securely
because
the
soldiers
had
now
arrived
who
interrupted
the
completion
of
my
deed
they
held
the
dagger
in
their
hand
and
were
relating
how
the
matter
happened
and
the
great
trouble
they
had
to
pull
the
weapon
from
the
neck
and
of
the
man
whose
name
they
did
not
know
just
then
giovan
bandini
came
up
and
said
to
them
poniard
is
mine
and
i
lent
it
to
benvenuto
who
was
bent
on
revenging
his
the
soldiers
were
profuse
in
their
expressions
of
regret
at
having
interrupted
me
although
my
vengeance
had
been
amply
satisfied
more
than
eight
days
elapsed
and
the
pope
did
not
send
for
me
according
to
his
custom
afterwards
he
summoned
me
through
his
chamberlain
the
bolognese
nobleman
i
have
already
mentioned
who
let
me
in
his
own
modest
manner
understand
that
his
holiness
knew
all
but
was
very
well
inclined
toward
me
and
that
i
had
only
to
mind
my
work
and
keep
quiet
when
we
reached
the
presence
the
pope
cast
so
menacing
a
glance
towards
me
that
the
mere
look
of
his
eyes
made
me
tremble
afterwards
upon
examining
my
work
his
countenance
cleared
and
he
began
to
praise
me
beyond
measure
saying
that
i
had
done
a
vast
amount
in
a
short
time
then
looking
me
straight
in
the
face
he
added
that
you
are
cured
benvenuto
take
heed
how
you
i
who
understood
his
meaning
promised
that
i
would
immediately
upon
this
i
opened
a
very
fine
shop
in
the
banchi
opposite
raffaello
and
there
i
finished
the
jewel
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
months
note
i
have
translated
this
word
but
it
seems
to
mean
all
the
coining
instruments
or
being
the
dies
proper
note
pistolese
it
came
in
time
to
mean
a
cutlass

note
bandini
bears
a
distinguished
name
in
florentine
annals
he
served
duke
alessandro
in
affairs
of
much
importance
but
afterwards
he
betrayed
the
interests
of
his
master
duke
cosimo
in
an
embassy
to
charles
v
in
it
seems
that
he
had
then
been
playing
into
the
hands
of
filippo
strozzi
for
which
offence
he
passed
fifteen
years
in
a
dungeon

varchi

cap

note
this
was
the
hint
to
cellini
that
he
was
aware
of
the
murder
he
had
just
committed
lii
the
pope
had
sent
me
all
those
precious
stones
except
the
diamond
which
was
pawned
to
certain
genoese
bankers
for
some
pressing
need
he
had
of
money
the
rest
were
in
my
custody
together
with
a
model
of
the
diamond
i
had
five
excellent
journeymen
and
in
addition
to
the
great
piece
i
was
engaged
on
several
jobs
so
that
my
shop
contained
property
of
much
value
in
jewels
gems
and
gold
and
silver
i
kept
a
shaggy
dog
very
big
and
handsome
which
duke
alessandro
gave
me
the
beast
was
capital
as
a
retriever
since
he
brought
me
every
sort
of
birds
and
game
i
shot
but
he
also
served
most
admirably
for
a
watchdog
it
happened
as
was
natural
at
the
age
of
that
i
had
taken
into
my
service
a
girl
of
great
beauty
and
grace
whom
i
used
as
a
model
in
my
art
and
who
was
also
complaisant
of
her
personal
favours
to
me
such
being
the
case
i
occupied
an
apartment
far
away
from
my
rooms
as
well
as
from
the
shop
and
this
communicated
by
a
little
dark
passage
with
the
bedroom
i
used
frequently
to
pass
the
night
with
her
and
though
i
sleep
as
lightly
as
ever
yet
did
man
upon
this
earth
yet
after
indulgence
in
sexual
pleasure
my
slumber
is
sometimes
very
deep
and
heavy
so
it
chanced
one
night
for
i
must
say
that
a
thief
under
the
pretext
of
being
a
goldsmith
had
spied
on
me
and
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
precious
stones
and
made
a
plan
to
steal
them
well
then
this
fellow
broke
into
the
shop
where
he
found
a
quantity
of
little
things
in
gold
and
silver
he
was
engaged
in
bursting
open
certain
boxes
to
get
at
the
jewels
he
had
noticed
when
my
dog
jumped
upon
him
and
put
him
to
much
trouble
to
defend
himself
with
his
sword
the
dog
unable
to
grapple
with
an
armed
man
ran
several
times
through
the
house
and
rushed
into
the
rooms
of
the
journeymen
which
had
been
left
open
because
of
the
great
heat
when
he
found
they
paid
no
heed
to
his
loud
barking
he
dragged
their
off
and
when
they
still
heard
nothing
he
pulled
first
one
and
then
another
by
the
arm
till
he
roused
them
and
barking
furiously
ran
before
to
show
them
where
he
wanted
them
to
go
at
last
it
became
clear
that
they
refused
to
follow
for
the
traitors
cross
at
being
disturbed
threw
stones
and
sticks
at
him
and
this
they
could
well
do
for
i
had
ordered
them
to
keep
all
night
a
lamp
alight
there
and
in
the
end
they
shut
their
rooms
tight
so
the
dog
abandoning
all
hope
of
aid
from
such
rascals
set
out
alone
again
on
his
adventure
he
ran
down
and
not
finding
the
thief
in
the
shop
flew
after
him
when
he
got
at
him
he
tore
the
cape
off
his
back
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
the
fellow
had
he
not
called
for
help
to
certain
tailors
praying
them
for
sake
to
save
him
from
a
mad
dog
and
they
believing
what
he
said
jumped
out
and
drove
the
dog
off
with
much
trouble
after
sunrise
my
workmen
went
into
the
shop
and
saw
that
it
had
been
broken
open
and
all
the
boxes
smashed
they
began
to
scream
at
the
top
of
their
voices
woe
is
me
ah
woe
is
me
the
clamour
woke
me
and
i
rushed
out
in
a
panic
appearing
thus
before
them
they
cried
out
to
us
for
we
have
been
robbed
by
some
one
who
has
broken
and
borne
everything
away
these
words
wrought
so
forcibly
upon
my
mind
that
i
dared
not
go
to
my
big
chest
and
look
if
it
still
held
the
jewels
of
the
pope
so
intense
was
the
anxiety
that
i
seemed
to
lose
my
eyesight
and
told
them
they
themselves
must
unlock
the
chest
and
see
how
many
of
the
gems
were
missing
the
fellow
were
all
of
them
in
their
shirts
and
when
on
opening
the
chest
they
saw
the
precious
stones
and
my
work
with
them
they
took
heart
of
joy
and
shouted
is
no
harm
done
your
piece
and
all
the
stones
are
here
but
the
thief
has
left
us
naked
to
the
shirt
because
last
night
by
reason
of
the
burning
heat
we
took
our
clothes
off
in
the
shop
and
left
them
recovering
my
senses
i
thanked
god
and
said
and
get
yourselves
new
suits
of
clothes
i
will
pay
when
i
hear
at
leisure
how
the
whole
thing
what
caused
me
the
most
pain
and
made
me
lose
my
senses
and
take
contrary
to
my
real
the
dread
lest
peradventure
folk
should
fancy
i
had
trumped
a
story
of
the
robber
up
to
steal
the
jewels
it
had
already
been
paid
to
pope
clement
by
one
of
his
most
trusted
servants
and
by
others
that
is
by
francesco
del
nero
zana
biliotti
his
accountant
the
bishop
of
vasona
and
several
such
men
most
blessed
father
do
you
confide
gems
of
that
vast
value
to
a
young
fellow
who
is
all
fire
more
passionate
for
arms
than
for
his
art
and
not
yet
thirty
years
of
age
the
pope
asked
in
answer
if
any
one
of
them
knew
that
i
had
done
aught
to
justify
such
suspicions
whereto
francesco
del
nero
his
treasurer
replied
most
blessed
father
because
he
has
not
as
yet
had
an
opportunity
the
pope
rejoined
regard
him
as
a
thoroughly
honest
man
and
if
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
some
crime
he
had
committed
i
should
not
believe
this
was
the
man
who
caused
me
the
greatest
torment
and
who
suddenly
came
up
before
my
mind
after
telling
the
young
men
to
provide
themselves
with
fresh
clothes
i
took
my
piece
together
with
the
gems
setting
them
as
well
as
i
could
in
their
proper
places
and
went
off
at
once
with
them
to
the
pope
francesco
del
nero
had
already
told
him
something
of
the
trouble
in
my
shop
and
had
put
suspicions
in
his
head
so
then
taking
the
thing
rather
ill
than
otherwise
he
shot
a
furious
glance
upon
me
and
cried
haughtily
have
you
come
to
do
here
what
is
up
are
all
your
precious
stones
and
not
one
of
them
is
at
this
the
face
cleared
and
he
said
then
i
showed
him
the
piece
and
while
he
was
inspecting
it
i
related
to
him
the
whole
story
of
the
thief
and
of
my
agony
and
what
had
been
my
greatest
trouble
in
the
matter
during
this
speech
he
oftentimes
turned
round
to
look
me
sharply
in
the
eyes
and
francesco
del
nero
being
also
in
the
presence
this
seemed
to
make
him
half
sorry
that
he
had
not
guessed
the
truth
at
last
breaking
into
laughter
at
the
long
tale
i
was
telling
he
sent
me
off
with
these
words
and
take
heed
to
be
an
honest
man
as
indeed
i
know
that
you
note
of
these
people
we
can
trace
the
bishop
of
vasona
he
was
girolamo
schio
or
schedo
a
native
of
vicenza
the
confidential
agent
and
confessor
of
clement
who
obtained
the
see
of
vaison
in
the
county
of
avignon
in
and
died
at
rome
in
his
successor
in
the
bishopric
was
tomaso
cortesi
the
datary
mentioned
above
note
varchi
gives
a
very
ugly
account
of
this
man
francesco
del
nero
who
was
nicknamed
the
del
piccadiglio
in
his
history
of
florence
book
iii
the
whole
city
of
florence
there
never
was
born
in
my
belief
a
man
of
such
irreligion
or
of
such
sordid
giovio
confirms
the
statement
note
fu
quello
che
this
may
be
neuter
was
the
circumstance
which
liii
i
went
on
working
assiduously
at
the
button
and
at
the
same
time
laboured
for
the
mint
when
certain
pieces
of
false
money
got
abroad
in
rome
stamped
with
my
own
dies
they
were
brought
at
once
to
the
pope
who
hearing
things
against
me
said
to
giacopo
balducci
the
master
of
the
mint
every
means
in
your
power
to
find
the
criminal
for
we
are
sure
that
benvenuto
is
an
honest
that
traitor
of
a
master
being
in
fact
my
enemy
replied
god
most
blessed
father
that
it
may
turn
out
as
you
say
for
we
have
some
proofs
against
upon
this
the
pope
turned
to
the
governor
of
rome
and
bade
him
see
he
found
the
malefactor
during
those
days
the
pope
sent
for
me
and
leading
cautiously
in
conversation
to
the
topic
of
the
coins
asked
me
at
the
fitting
moment
should
you
have
the
heart
to
coin
false
money
to
this
i
replied
that
i
thought
i
could
do
so
better
than
all
the
rascals
who
gave
their
minds
to
such
vile
work
for
fellows
who
practice
lewd
trades
of
that
sort
are
not
capable
of
earning
money
nor
are
they
men
of
much
ability
i
on
the
contrary
with
my
poor
wits
could
gain
enough
to
keep
me
comfortably
for
when
i
set
dies
for
the
mint
each
morning
before
dinner
i
put
at
least
three
crowns
into
my
pocket
this
was
the
customary
payment
for
the
dies
and
the
master
of
the
mint
bore
me
a
grudge
because
he
would
have
liked
to
have
them
cheaper
so
then
what
i
earned
with
grace
and
the
sufficed
me
and
by
coining
false
money
i
should
not
have
made
so
much
the
pope
very
well
perceived
my
drift
and
whereas
he
had
formerly
given
orders
that
they
should
see
i
did
not
fly
from
rome
he
now
told
them
to
look
well
about
and
have
no
heed
of
me
seeing
he
was
to
anger
me
and
in
this
way
run
the
risk
of
losing
me
the
officials
who
received
these
orders
were
certain
clerks
of
the
camera
who
made
the
proper
search
as
was
their
duty
and
soon
found
the
rogue
he
was
a
stamper
in
the
service
of
the
mint
named
cesare
macherone
and
a
roman
citizen
together
with
this
man
they
detected
a
of
the
mint
note
the
word
in
cellini
is
ovolatore
di
zecca
liv
on
that
very
day
as
i
was
passing
through
the
piazza
navona
and
had
my
fine
retriever
with
me
just
when
we
came
opposite
the
gate
of
the
bargello
my
dog
flew
barking
loudly
inside
the
door
upon
a
youth
who
had
been
arrested
at
the
suit
of
a
man
called
donnino
a
goldsmith
from
parma
and
a
former
pupil
of
caradosso
on
the
charge
of
having
robbed
him
the
dog
strove
so
violently
to
tear
the
fellow
to
pieces
that
the
constables
were
moved
to
pity
it
so
happened
that
he
was
pleading
his
own
cause
with
boldness
and
donnino
had
not
evidence
enough
to
support
the
accusation
and
what
was
more
one
of
the
corporals
of
the
guard
a
genoese
was
a
friend
of
the
young
father
the
upshot
was
that
what
with
the
dog
and
with
those
other
circumstances
they
were
on
the
point
of
releasing
their
prisoner
when
i
came
up
the
dog
had
lost
all
fear
of
sword
or
staves
and
was
flying
once
more
at
the
young
man
so
they
told
me
if
i
did
not
call
the
brute
off
they
would
kill
him
i
held
him
back
as
well
as
i
was
able
but
just
then
the
fellow
in
the
act
of
readjusting
his
cape
let
fall
some
paper
packets
from
the
hood
which
donnino
recognised
as
his
property
i
too
recognised
a
little
ring
whereupon
i
called
out
is
the
thief
who
broke
into
my
shop
and
robbed
it
and
therefore
my
dog
knows
him
then
i
loosed
the
dog
who
flew
again
upon
the
robber
on
this
the
fellow
craved
for
mercy
promising
to
give
back
whatever
he
possessed
of
mine
when
i
had
secured
the
dog
he
proceeded
to
restore
the
gold
and
silver
and
the
rings
which
he
had
stolen
from
me
and
crowns
in
addition
then
he
cried
once
more
to
me
for
pity
i
told
him
to
make
his
peace
with
god
for
i
should
do
him
neither
good
nor
evil
so
i
returned
to
my
business
and
a
few
days
afterwards
cesare
macherone
the
false
coiner
was
hanged
in
the
banchi
opposite
the
mint
his
accomplice
was
sent
to
the
galleys
the
genoese
thief
was
hanged
in
the
campo
di
fiore
while
i
remained
in
better
repute
as
an
honest
man
than
i
had
enjoyed
before
lv
when
i
had
nearly
finished
my
piece
there
happened
that
terrible
inundation
which
flooded
the
whole
of
rome
i
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
the
day
was
spent
for
the
clocks
struck
and
the
water
went
on
rising
formidably
now
the
front
of
my
house
and
shop
faced
the
banchi
but
the
back
was
several
yards
higher
because
it
turned
toward
monte
giordano
accordingly
bethinking
me
first
of
my
own
safety
and
in
the
next
place
of
my
honour
i
filled
my
pockets
with
the
jewels
and
gave
the
into
the
custody
of
my
workmen
and
then
descended
barefoot
from
the
and
waded
as
well
as
i
could
until
i
reached
monte
cavallo
there
i
sought
out
messer
giovanni
gaddi
clerk
of
the
camera
and
bastiano
veneziano
the
painter
to
the
former
i
confided
the
precious
stones
to
keep
in
safety
he
had
the
same
regard
for
me
as
though
i
had
been
his
brother
a
few
days
later
when
the
rage
of
the
river
was
spent
i
returned
to
my
workshop
and
finished
the
piece
with
such
good
fortune
through
grace
and
my
own
great
industry
that
it
was
held
to
be
the
finest
masterpiece
which
had
been
ever
seen
in
rome
when
then
i
took
it
to
the
pope
he
was
insatiable
in
praising
me
and
said
i
but
a
wealthy
emperor
i
would
give
my
benvenuto
as
much
land
as
his
eyes
could
survey
yet
being
nowadays
but
needy
bankrupt
potentates
we
will
at
any
rate
give
him
bread
enough
to
satisfy
his
modest
i
let
the
pope
run
on
to
the
end
of
his
rhodomontade
and
then
asked
him
for
a
place
which
happened
to
be
vacant
he
replied
that
he
would
grant
me
something
of
far
greater
consequence
i
begged
his
holiness
to
bestow
this
little
thing
on
me
meanwhile
by
way
of
earnest
he
began
to
laugh
and
said
he
was
willing
but
that
he
did
not
wish
me
to
serve
and
that
i
must
make
some
arrangement
with
the
other
to
be
exempted
he
would
allow
them
through
me
a
certain
favour
for
which
they
had
already
petitioned
namely
the
right
of
recovering
their
fees
at
law
this
was
accordingly
done
and
that
office
brought
me
in
little
less
than
crowns
a
year
note
this
took
place
on
the
and
october
note
this
famous
masterpiece
was
preserved
in
the
castle
of
angelo
during
the
papal
government
of
rome
it
was
brought
out
on
christmas
easter
and
days
note
sua
smania
di
parole
note
cellini
received
this
post
among
the
mazzieri
who
walked
like
beadles
before
the
pope
on
april
he
resigned
it
in
favour
of
pietro
cornaro
of
venice
in
lvi
i
continued
to
work
for
the
pope
executing
now
one
trifle
and
now
another
when
he
commissioned
me
to
design
a
chalice
of
exceeding
richness
so
i
made
both
drawing
and
model
for
the
piece
the
latter
was
constructed
of
wood
and
wax
instead
of
the
usual
top
i
fashioned
three
figures
of
a
fair
size
in
the
round
they
represented
faith
hope
and
charity
corresponding
to
these
at
the
base
of
the
cup
were
three
circular
histories
in
one
was
the
nativity
of
christ
the
second
the
resurrection
and
the
third
peter
crucified
head
downwards
for
thus
i
had
received
commission
while
i
had
this
work
in
hand
the
pope
was
often
pleased
to
look
at
it
wherefore
observing
that
his
holiness
had
never
thought
again
of
giving
me
anything
and
knowing
that
a
post
in
the
piombo
was
vacant
i
asked
for
this
one
evening
the
good
pope
quite
oblivious
of
his
extravagances
at
the
termination
of
the
last
piece
said
to
me
post
in
the
piombo
is
worth
more
than
crowns
a
year
so
that
if
i
gave
it
you
you
would
spend
your
time
in
scratching
your
paunch
and
your
magnificent
handicraft
would
be
lost
and
i
should
bear
the
i
replied
at
once
as
thus
of
a
good
breed
mouse
better
when
they
are
fat
than
starving
and
likewise
honest
men
who
possess
some
talent
exercise
it
to
far
nobler
purport
when
they
have
the
wherewithal
to
live
abundantly
wherefore
princes
who
provide
such
folk
with
competences
let
your
holiness
take
notice
are
watering
the
roots
of
genius
for
genius
and
talent
at
their
birth
come
into
this
world
lean
and
scabby
and
your
holiness
should
also
know
that
i
never
asked
for
the
place
with
the
hope
of
getting
it
only
too
happy
i
to
have
that
miserable
post
of
on
the
other
i
built
but
castles
in
the
air
your
holiness
will
do
well
since
you
do
not
care
to
give
it
me
to
bestow
it
on
a
man
of
talent
who
deserves
it
and
not
upon
some
fat
ignoramus
who
will
spend
his
time
scratching
his
paunch
if
i
may
quote
your
own
words
follow
the
example
of
pope
illustrious
memory
who
conferred
an
office
of
the
same
kind
upon
bramante
that
most
admirable
immediately
on
finishing
this
speech
i
made
my
bow
and
went
off
in
a
fury
then
bastiano
veneziano
the
painter
approached
and
said
blessed
father
may
your
holiness
be
willing
to
grant
it
to
one
who
works
assiduously
in
the
exercise
of
some
talent
and
as
your
holiness
knows
that
i
am
diligent
in
my
art
i
beg
that
i
may
be
thought
worthy
of
the
pope
replied
devil
benvenuto
will
not
brook
rebuke
i
was
inclined
to
give
it
him
but
it
is
not
right
to
be
so
haughty
with
a
pope
therefore
i
do
not
well
know
what
i
am
to
the
bishop
of
vasona
then
came
up
and
put
in
a
word
for
bastiano
saying
blessed
father
benvenuto
is
but
young
and
a
sword
becomes
him
better
than
a
frock
let
your
holiness
give
the
place
to
this
ingenious
person
bastiano
some
time
or
other
you
will
be
able
to
bestow
on
benvenuto
a
good
thing
perhaps
more
suitable
to
him
than
this
would
then
the
pope
turning
to
messer
bartolommeo
valori
told
him
next
you
meet
benvenuto
let
him
know
from
me
that
it
was
he
who
got
that
office
in
the
piombo
for
bastiano
the
painter
and
add
that
he
may
reckon
on
obtaining
the
next
considerable
place
that
falls
meanwhile
let
him
look
to
his
behaviour
and
finish
my
the
following
evening
two
hours
after
sundown
i
met
messer
bartolommeo
valori
at
the
corner
of
the
mint
he
was
preceded
by
two
torches
and
was
going
in
haste
to
the
pope
who
had
sent
for
him
on
my
taking
off
my
hat
he
stopped
and
called
me
and
reported
in
the
most
friendly
manner
all
the
messages
the
pope
had
sent
me
i
replied
that
i
should
complete
my
work
with
greater
diligence
and
application
than
any
i
had
yet
attempted
but
without
the
least
hope
of
having
any
reward
whatever
from
the
pope
messer
bartolommeo
reproved
me
saying
that
this
was
not
the
way
in
which
one
ought
to
reply
to
the
advances
of
a
pope
i
answered
that
i
should
be
mad
to
reply
if
i
based
my
hopes
on
such
promises
being
certain
to
get
nothing
so
i
departed
and
went
off
to
my
business
messer
bartolommeo
must
have
reported
my
audacious
speeches
to
the
pope
and
more
perhaps
than
i
had
really
said
for
his
holiness
waited
above
two
months
before
he
sent
to
me
and
during
that
while
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
go
uncalled
for
to
the
palace
yet
he
was
dying
with
impatience
to
see
the
chalice
and
commissioned
messer
ruberto
pucci
to
give
heed
to
what
i
was
about
that
right
worthy
fellow
came
daily
to
visit
me
and
always
gave
me
some
kindly
word
which
i
returned
the
time
was
drawing
nigh
now
for
the
pope
to
travel
toward
bologna
so
at
last
perceiving
that
i
did
not
mean
to
come
to
him
he
made
messer
ruberto
bid
me
bring
my
work
that
he
might

how
i
was
getting
on
accordingly
i
took
it
and
having
shown
as
the
piece
itself
proved
that
the
most
important
part
was
finished
i
begged
him
to
advance
me
five
hundred
crowns
partly
on
account
and
partly
because
i
wanted
gold
to
complete
the
chalice
the
pope
said
on
go
on
at
work
till
it
is
i
answered
as
i
took
my
leave
that
i
would
finish
it
if
he
paid
me
the
money
and
so
i
went

for

after
eight
days
bidding
me
bring

went

him

the
piece

had
i
shown
my
face
than

called

ready

looked
more
like

than

man

uglier
by
half
than
he
was
naturally
and

at

to
cut

matter

cried
out

you
to

have

go

i

me
to

deeds
worthy
of
them
but
for
my
present

i
snap
my
fingers
at
your
galleys

what
is
more
i
tell
you
that
just
because
of
you

will

must

lviii
the
pope
came
back
from
bologna
and
sent
at
once
for
me
because
the
cardinal
had
written
the
worst
he
could
of
my
affairs
in
his
despatches
he
was
in
the
hottest
rage
imaginable
and
bade
me
come
upon
the
instant
with
my
piece
i
obeyed
now
while
the
pope
was
staying
at
bologna
i
had
suffered
from
an
attack
of
inflammation
in
the
eyes
so
painful
that
i
scarce
could
go
on
living
for
the
torment
and
this
was
the
chief
reason
why
i
had
not
carried
out
my
work
the
trouble
was
so
serious
that
i
expected
for
certain
to
be
left
without
my
eyesight
and
i
had
reckoned
up
the
sum
on
which
i
could
subsist
if
i
were
blind
for
life
upon
the
way
to
the
pope
i
turned
over
in
my
mind
what
i
should
put
forward
to
excuse
myself
for
not
having
been
able
to
advance
his
work
i
thought
that
while
he
was
inspecting
the
chalice
i
might
tell
him
of
my
personal
embarrassments
however
i
was
unable
to
do
so
for
when
i
arrived
in
the
presence
he
broke
out
coarsely
at
me
here
with
your
work
is
it
finished
i
displayed
it
and
his
temper
rising
he
exclaimed
truth
i
tell
thee
thou
that
makest
it
thy
business
to
hold
no
man
in
regard
that
were
it
not
for
decency
and
order
i
would
have
thee
chucked
together
with
thy
work
there
out
of
accordingly
when
i
perceived
that
the
pope
had
become
no
better
than
a
vicious
beast
my
chief
anxiety
was
how
i
could
manage
to
withdraw
from
his
presence
so
while
he
went
on
bullying
i
tucked
the
piece
beneath
my
cape
and
muttered
under
my
breath
whole
world
could
not
compel
a
blind
man
to
execute
such
things
as
raising
his
voice
still
higher
the
pope
shouted
here
what
thou
i
stayed
in
two
minds
whether
or
not
to
dash
at
full
speed
down
the
staircase
then
i
took
my
decision
and
threw
myself
upon
my
knees
shouting
as
loudly
as
i
could
for
he
too
had
not
ceased
from
shouting
an
infirmidy
has
blinded
me
am
i
bound
to
go
on
working
he
retorted
saw
well
enough
to
make
your
way
hither
and
i
believe
one
word
of
what
you
i
answered
for
i
noticed
he
had
dropped
his
voice
a
little
your
holiness
inquire
of
your
physician
and
you
will
find
the
truth
he
said
ho
softly
at
leisure
we
shall
hear
if
what
you
say
is
then
perceiving
that
he
was
willing
to
give
me
hearing
i
added
am
convinced
that
the
only
cause
of
this
great
trouble
which
has
happened
to
me
is
cardinal
salviati
for
he
sent
to
me
immediately
after
your
departure
and
when
i
presented
myself
he
called
my
work
a
stew
of
onions
and
told
me
he
would
send
me
to
complete
it
in
a
galley
and
such
was
the
effect
upon
me
of
his
knavish
words
that
in
my
passion
i
felt
my
face
in
flame
and
so
intolerable
a
heat
attacked
my
eyes
that
i
could
not
find
my
own
way
home
two
days
afterwards
cataracts
fell
on
both
my
eyes
i
quite
lost
my
sight
and
after
your
departure
i
have
been
unable
to
work
at
rising
from
my
knees
i
left
the
presence
without
further
license
it
was
afterwards
reported
to
me
that
the
pope
has
said
can
give
commissions
but
not
the
prudence
to
perform
them
i
did
not
tell
the
cardinal
to
go
so
brutally
about
this
business
if
it
is
true
that
he
is
suffering
from
his
eyes
of
which
i
shall
get
information
through
my
doctor
one
ought
to
make
allowance
for
a
great
gentleman
intimate
with
the
pope
and
a
man
of
very
distinguished
parts
happened
to
be
present
he
asked
who
i
was
using
terms
like
these
blessed
father
pardon
if
i
put
a
question
i
have
seen
you
yield
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
the
hottest
anger
i
ever
observed
and
then
to
the
warmest
compassion
so
i
beg
your
holiness
to
tell
me
who
the
man
is
for
if
he
is
a
person
worthy
to
be
helped
i
can
teach
him
a
secret
which
may
cure
him
of
that
the
pope
replied
is
the
greatest
artist
who
was
ever
born
in
his
own
craft
one
day
when
we
are
together
i
will
show
you
some
of
his
marvellous
works
and
the
man
himself
to
boot
and
i
shall
be
pleased
if
we
can
see
our
way
toward
doing
something
to
assist
three
days
after
this
the
pope
sent
for
me
after
dinnertime
and
i
found
that
great
noble
in
the
presence
on
my
arrival
the
pope
had
my
brought
and
i
in
the
meantime
drew
forth
my
chalice
the
nobleman
said
on
looking
at
it
that
he
had
never
seen
a
more
stupendous
piece
of
work
when
the
button
came
he
was
still
more
struck
with
wonder
and
looking
me
straight
in
the
face
he
added
man
is
young
i
trow
to
be
so
able
in
his
art
and
still
apt
enough
to
learn
he
then
asked
me
what
my
name
was
i
answered
name
is
he
replied
benvenuto
shall
i
be
this
day
to
you
take
stalk
blossom
root
together
then
decoct
them
over
a
slack
fire
and
with
the
liquid
bathe
your
eyes
several
times
a
day
you
will
most
certainly
be
cured
of
that
weakness
but
see
that
you
purge
first
and
then
go
forward
with
the
the
pope
gave
me
some
kind
words
and
so
i
went
away
half
satisfied
note
mettessi
tanta
mazza
lix
it
was
true
indeed
that
i
had
got
the
sickness
but
i
believe
i
caught
it
from
that
fine
young
whom
i
was
keeping
when
my
house
was
robbed
the
french
disease
for
it
was
that
remained
in
me
more
than
four
months
dormant
before
it
showed
itself
and
then
it
broke
out
over
my
whole
body
at
one
instant
it
was
not
like
what
one
commonly
observes
but
covered
my
flesh
with
certain
blisters
of
the
size
of
and
the
doctors
would
not
call
it
the
french
disease
albeit
i
told
them
why
i
thought
it
was
that
i
went
on
treating
myself
according
to
their
methods
but
derived
no
benefit
at
last
then
i
resolved
on
taking
the
wood
against
the
advice
of
the
first
physicians
in
rome
and
i
took
it
with
the
most
scrupulous
discipline
and
rules
of
abstinence
that
could
be
thought
of
and
after
a
few
days
i
perceived
in
me
a
great
amendment
the
result
was
that
at
the
end
of
fifty
days
i
was
cured
and
as
sound
as
a
fish
in
the
water
some
time
afterwards
i
sought
to
mend
my
shattered
health
and
with
this
view
i
betook
myself
to
shooting
when
the
winter
came
in
that
amusement
however
led
me
to
expose
myself
to
wind
and
water
and
to
staying
out
in
so
that
after
a
few
days
i
fell
a
hundred
times
more
ill
than
i
had
been
before
i
put
myself
once
more
under
orders
and
attended
to
their
directions
but
grew
always
worse
when
the
fever
fell
upon
me
i
resolved
on
having
recourse
again
to
the
wood
but
the
doctors
forbade
it
saying
that
i
took
if
it
with
the
fever
on
me
i
should
not
have
a
week
to
live
however
i
made
my
mind
up
to
disobey
their
orders
observed
the
same
diet
as
i
had
formerly
adopted
and
after
drinking
the
decoction
four
days
was
wholly
rid
of
fever
my
health
improved
enormously
and
while
i
was
following
this
cure
i
went
on
always
working
at
the
models
of
the
chalice
i
may
add
that
during
the
time
of
that
strict
abstinence
i
produced
finer
things
and
of
more
exquisite
invention
than
at
any
other
period
of
my
life
after
fifty
days
my
health
was
and
i
continued
with
the
utmost
care
to
keep
it
and
confirm
it
when
at
last
i
ventured
to
relax
my
rigid
diet
i
found
myself
as
wholly
free
from
those
infirmities
as
though
i
had
been
born
again
although
i
took
pleasure
in
fortifying
the
health
i
so
much
longed
for
yet
i
never
left
off
working
both
the
chalice
and
the
mint
had
certainly
as
much
of
my
attention
as
was
due
to
them
and
to
myself

it
happened
that
cardinal
salviati
who
as
i
have
related
entertained
an
old
hostility
against
me
had
been
appointed
legate
to
parma
in
that
city
a
certain
milanese
goldsmith
named
tobbia
was
taken
up
for
false
coining
and
condemned
to
the
gallows
and
the
stake
representations
in
his
favour
as
being
a
man
of
great
ability
were
made
to
the
cardinal
who
suspended
the
execution
of
the
sentence
and
wrote
to
the
pope
saying
the
best
goldsmith
in
the
world
had
come
into
his
hands
sentenced
to
death
for
coining
false
money
but
that
he
was
a
good
simple
fellow
who
could
plead
in
his
excuse
that
he
had
taken
counsel
with
his
confessor
and
had
received
as
he
said
from
him
permission
to
do
this
thereto
he
added
you
send
for
this
great
artist
to
rome
your
holiness
will
bring
down
the
overweening
arrogance
of
your
favourite
benvenuto
and
i
am
quite
certain
that
work
will
please
you
far
more
than
the
pope
accordingly
sent
for
him
at
once
and
when
the
man
arrived
he
made
us
both
appear
before
him
and
commissioned
each
of
us
to
furnish
a
design
for
mounting
an
horn
the
finest
which
had
ever
been
seen
and
which
had
been
sold
for
ducats
of
the
camera
the
pope
meant
to
give
it
to
king
francis
but
first
he
wished
it
richly
set
in
gold
and
ordered
us
to
make
sketches
for
this
purpose
when
they
were
finished
we
took
them
to
the
pope
that
of
tobbia
was
in
the
form
of
a
candlestick
the
horn
being
stuck
in
it
like
a
candle
and
at
the
base
of
the
piece
he
had
introduced
four
little
heads
of
a
very
poor
design
when
i
saw
the
thing
i
could
not
refrain
from
laughing
gently
in
my
sleeve
the
pope
noticed
this
and
cried
show
me
your
sketch
it
was
a
single
head
proportioned
in
size
to
the
horn
i
had
designed
the
finest
head
imaginable
for
i
took
it
partly
from
the
horse
and
partly
from
the
stag
enriching
it
with
fantastic
mane
and
other
ornaments
accordingly
no
sooner
was
it
seen
than
every
one
decided
in
my
favour
there
were
however
present
at
the
competition
certain
milanese
gentlemen
of
the
first
consequence
who
said
blessed
father
your
holiness
is
sending
this
magnificent
present
into
france
please
to
reflect
that
the
french
are
people
of
no
culture
and
will
not
understand
the
excellence
of
work
pyxes
like
this
one
of
will
suit
their
taste
well
and
these
too
can
be
finished
quicker
benvenuto
will
devote
himself
to
completing
your
chalice
and
you
will
get
two
pieces
done
in
the
same
time
moreover
this
poor
man
whom
you
have
brought
to
rome
will
have
the
chance
to
be
the
pope
who
was
anxious
to
obtain
his
chalice
very
willingly
adopted
the
advice
of
the
milanese
gentlefolk
next
day
therefore
he
commissioned
tobbia
to
mount
the
horn
and
sent
his
master
of
the
wardrobe
to
bid
me
finish
the
chalice
i
replied
that
i
desired
nothing
in
the
world
more
than
to
complete
the
beautiful
work
i
had
begun
and
if
the
material
had
been
anything
but
gold
i
could
very
easily
have
done
so
myself
but
it
being
gold
his
holiness
must
give
me
some
of
the
metal
if
he
wanted
me
to
get
through
with
my
work
to
this
the
vulgar
courtier
answered
ask
the
pope
for
gold
unless
you
mean
to
drive
him
into
such
a
fury
as
will
ruin
i
said
my
good
lord
will
your
lordship
please
to
tell
me
how
one
can
make
bread
without
flour
even
so
without
gold
this
piece
of
mine
can
not
be
the
master
of
the
wardrobe
having
an
inkling
that
i
had
made
a
fool
of
him
told
me
he
should
report
all
i
had
spoken
to
his
holiness
and
this
he
did
the
pope
flew
into
a
bestial
passion
and
swore
he
would
wait
to
see
if
i
was
so
mad
as
not
to
finish
it
more
than
two
months
passed
thus
and
though
i
had
declared
i
would
not
give
a
stroke
to
the
chalice
i
did
not
do
so
but
always
went
on
working
with
the
greatest
interest
when
he
perceived
i
was
not
going
to
bring
it
he
began
to
display
real
displeasure
and
protested
he
would
punish
me
in
one
way
or
another
a
jeweller
from
milan
in
the
papal
service
happened
to
be
present
when
these
words
were
spoken
he
was
called
pompeo
and
was
closely
related
to
messer
trajano
the
most
favoured
servant
of
pope
clement
the
two
men
came
upon
a
common
understanding
to
him
and
said
your
holiness
were
to
deprive
benvenuto
of
the
mint
perhaps
he
would
take
it
into
his
head
to
complete
the
to
this
the
pope
two
evil
things
would
happen
first
i
should
be
ill
served
in
the
mint
which
concerns
me
greatly
and
secondly
i
should
certainly
not
get
the
the
two
milanese
observing
the
pope
indisposed
towards
me
at
last
so
far
prevailed
that
he
deprived
me
of
the
mint
and
gave
it
to
a
young
perugian
commonly
known
as
fagiuolo
pompeo
came
to
inform
me
that
his
holiness
had
taken
my
place
in
the
mint
away
and
that
if
i
did
not
finish
the
chalice
he
would
deprive
me
of
other
things
besides
i
retorted
his
holiness
that
he
has
deprived
himself
and
not
me
of
the
mint
and
that
he
will
be
doing
the
same
with
regard
to
those
other
things
of
which
he
speaks
and
that
if
he
wants
to
confer
the
post
on
me
again
nothing
will
induce
me
to
accept
the
graceless
and
unlucky
fellow
went
off
like
an
arrow
to
find
the
pope
and
report
this
conversation
he
added
also
something
of
his
own
invention
eight
days
later
the
pope
sent
the
same
man
to
tell
me
that
he
did
not
mean
me
to
finish
the
chalice
and
wanted
to
have
it
back
precisely
at
the
point
to
which
i
had
already
brought
it
i
told
pompeo
thing
is
not
like
the
mint
which
it
was
in
his
power
to
take
away
but
five
hundred
crowns
which
i
received
belong
to
his
holiness
and
i
am
ready
to
return
them
the
piece
itself
is
mine
and
with
it
i
shall
do
what
i
think
pompeo
ran
off
to
report
my
speech
together
with
some
biting
words
which
in
my
righteous
anger
i
had
let
fly
at
himself
note
the
word
i
have
translated
is
vessels
for
holding
the
eucharist
note
the
master
of
the
wardrobe
was
at
that
time
giovanni
aleotti
i
need
hardly
remind
my
readers
that
or
wardrobe
was
the
apartment
in
a
palace
where
arms
plate
furniture
and
clothes
were
stored
we
shall
find
when
we
come
to
service
under
duke
cosimo
that
princes
spent
much
of
their
time
in
this
place
note
vasari
mentions
a
girolamo
fagiuoli
who
flourished
at
this
period
but
calls
him
a
bolognese
lxi
after
the
lapse
of
three
days
on
a
thursday
there
came
to
me
two
favourite
chamberlains
of
his
holiness
one
of
them
is
alive
now
and
a
bishop
he
was
called
messer
pier
giovanni
and
was
an
officer
of
the
wardrobe
the
other
could
claim
nobler
birth
but
his
name
has
escaped
me
on
arriving
they
spoke
as
follows
the
pope
hath
sent
us
benvenuto
and
since
you
have
not
chosen
to
comply
with
his
request
on
easy
terms
his
commands
now
are
that
either
you
should
give
us
up
his
piece
or
that
we
should
take
you
to
thereupon
i
looked
them
very
cheerfully
in
the
face
replying
lords
if
i
were
to
give
the
work
to
his
holiness
i
should
be
giving
what
is
mine
and
not
his
and
at
present
i
have
no
intention
to
make
him
this
gift
i
have
brought
it
far
forward
with
great
labour
and
do
not
want
it
to
go
into
the
hands
of
some
ignorant
beast
who
will
destroy
it
with
no
while
i
spoke
thus
the
goldsmith
tobbia
was
standing
by
who
even
presumptuously
asked
me
for
the
models
also
of
my
work
what
i
retorted
in
words
worthy
of
such
a
rascal
need
not
here
be
repeated
then
when
those
gentlemen
the
chamberlains
kept
urging
me
to
do
quickly
what
i
meant
to
do
i
told
them
i
was
ready
so
i
took
my
cape
up
and
before
i
left
the
shop
i
turned
to
an
image
of
christ
with
solemn
reverence
and
cap
in
hand
praying
as
thus
gracious
and
undying
just
and
holy
our
lord
all
the
things
thou
doest
are
according
to
thy
justice
which
hath
no
peer
on
earth
thou
knowest
that
i
have
exactly
reached
the
age
of
thirty
and
that
up
to
this
hour
i
was
never
threatened
with
a
prison
for
any
of
my
actions
now
that
it
is
thy
will
that
i
should
go
to
prison
with
all
my
heart
i
thank
thee
for
this
thereat
i
turned
round
to
the
two
chamberlains
and
addressed
them
with
a
certain
lowering
look
i
have
man
of
my
quality
deserved
no
meaner
catchpoles
than
your
lordships
place
me
between
you
and
take
me
as
your
prisoner
where
you
those
two
gentlemen
with
the
most
perfect
manners
burst
out
laughing
and
put
me
between
them
and
so
we
went
off
talking
pleasantly
until
they
brought
me
to
the
governor
of
rome
who
was
called
il
magalotto
when
i
reached
him
and
the
was
with
him
both
waiting
for
me
the
chamberlains
still
laughing
said
to
the
governor
give
up
to
you
this
prisoner
now
see
you
take
good
care
of
him
we
are
very
glad
to
have
acted
in
the
place
of
your
agents
for
benvenuto
has
told
us
that
this
being
his
first
arrest
he
deserved
no
catchpoles
of
inferior
station
than
we
immediately
on
leaving
us
they
sought
the
pope
and
when
they
had
minutely
related
the
whole
matter
he
made
at
first
as
though
he
would
give
way
to
passion
but
afterwards
he
put
control
upon
himself
and
laughed
because
there
were
then
in
the
presence
certain
lords
and
cardinals
my
friends
who
had
warmly
espoused
my
cause
meanwhile
the
governor
and
the
fiscal
were
at
me
partly
bullying
partly
expostulating
partly
giving
advice
and
saying
it
was
only
reason
that
a
man
who
ordered
work
from
another
should
be
able
to
withdraw
it
at
his
choice
and
in
any
way
which
he
thought
best
to
this
i
replied
that
such
proceedings
were
not
warranted
by
justice
neither
could
a
pope
act
thus
for
that
a
pope
is
not
of
the
same
kind
as
certain
petty
tyrant
princes
who
treat
their
folk
as
badly
as
they
can
without
regard
to
law
or
justice
and
so
a
vicar
of
christ
may
not
commit
any
of
these
acts
of
violence
thereat
the
governor
assuming
his
style
of
threatening
and
bullying
began
to
say
benvenuto
you
are
going
about
to
make
me
treat
you
as
you
will
treat
me
with
honour
and
courtesy
if
you
wish
to
act
as
i
taking
me
up
again
he
cried
for
the
work
at
once
and
wait
for
a
second
i
responded
lords
grant
me
the
favour
of
being
allowed
to
say
four
more
words
in
my
the
fiscal
who
was
a
far
more
reasonable
agent
of
police
than
the
governor
turned
to
him
and
said
suppose
we
let
him
say
a
hundred
words
if
he
likes
so
long
as
he
gives
up
the
work
that
is
enough
for
i
spoke
any
man
you
like
to
name
had
ordered
a
palace
or
a
house
to
be
built
he
could
with
justice
tell
the
do
not
want
you
to
go
on
working
at
my
house
or
palace
and
after
paying
him
his
labour
he
would
have
the
right
to
dismiss
him
likewise
if
a
nobleman
gave
commission
for
a
jewel
of
a
thousand
value
to
be
set
when
he
saw
that
the
jeweller
was
not
serving
him
according
to
his
desire
he
could
say
me
back
my
stone
for
i
do
not
want
your
but
in
a
case
of
this
kind
none
of
those
considerations
apply
there
is
neither
house
nor
jewel
here
nobody
can
command
me
further
than
that
i
should
return
the
five
hundred
crowns
which
i
have
had
therefore
monsignori
do
everything
you
can
do
for
you
will
get
nothing
from
me
beyond
the
five
hundred
crowns
go
and
say
this
to
the
pope
your
threats
do
not
frighten
me
at
all
for
i
am
an
honest
man
and
stand
in
no
fear
of
my
the
governor
and
fiscal
rose
and
said
they
were
going
to
the
pope
and
should
return
with
orders
which
i
should
soon
learn
to
my
cost
so
i
remained
there
under
guard
i
walked
up
and
down
a
large
hall
and
they
were
about
three
hours
away
before
they
came
back
from
the
pope
in
that
while
the
flower
of
our
nation
among
the
merchants
came
to
visit
me
imploring
me
not
to
persist
in
contending
with
a
pope
for
this
might
be
the
ruin
of
me
i
answered
them
that
i
had
made
my
mind
up
quite
well
what
i
wished
to
do
note
gregorio
magalotti
was
a
roman
the
was
then
benedetto
valenti
magalotti
is
said
to
have
discharged
his
office
with
extreme
severity
and
to
have
run
great
risks
of
his
life
in
consequence
lxii
no
sooner
had
the
governor
returned
together
with
the
procurator
from
the
palace
than
he
sent
for
me
and
spoke
to
this
effect
i
am
certainly
sorry
to
come
back
from
the
pope
with
such
commands
as
i
have
received
you
must
either
produce
the
chalice
on
the
instant
or
look
to
your
then
i
replied
that
as
i
had
never
to
that
hour
believed
a
holy
vicar
of
christ
could
commit
an
unjust
act
so
i
should
like
to
see
it
before
i
did
believe
it
therefore
do
the
utmost
that
you
the
governor
rejoined
have
to
report
a
couple
of
words
more
from
the
pope
to
you
and
then
i
will
execute
the
orders
given
me
he
says
that
you
must
bring
your
work
to
me
here
and
that
after
i
have
seen
it
put
into
a
box
and
sealed
i
must
take
it
to
him
he
engages
his
word
not
to
break
the
seal
and
to
return
the
piece
to
you
untouched
but
this
much
he
wants
to
have
done
in
order
to
preserve
his
own
honour
in
the
in
return
to
this
speech
i
answered
laughing
that
i
would
very
willingly
give
up
my
work
in
the
way
he
mentioned
because
i
should
be
glad
to
know
for
certain
what
a
word
was
really
worth
accordingly
i
sent
for
my
piece
and
having
had
it
sealed
as
described
gave
it
up
to
him
the
governor
repaired
again
to
the
pope
who
took
the
box
according
to
what
the
governor
himself
told
me
and
turned
it
several
times
about
then
he
asked
the
governor
if
he
had
seen
the
work
and
he
replied
that
he
had
and
that
it
had
been
sealed
up
in
his
presence
and
added
that
it
had
struck
him
as
a
very
admirable
piece
thereupon
the
pope
said
shall
tell
benvenuto
that
popes
have
authority
to
bind
and
loose
things
of
far
greater
consequence
than
this
and
while
thus
speaking
he
opened
the
box
with
some
show
of
anger
taking
off
the
string
and
seals
with
which
it
was
done
up
afterwards
he
paid
it
prolonged
attention
and
as
i
subsequently
heard
showed
it
to
tobbia
the
who
bestowed
much
praise
upon
it
then
the
pope
asked
him
if
he
felt
equal
to
producing
a
piece
in
that
style
on
his
saying
yes
the
pope
told
him
to
follow
it
out
exactly
then
turned
to
the
governor
and
said
whether
benvenuto
will
give
it
up
for
if
he
does
he
shall
be
paid
the
value
fixed
on
it
by
men
of
knowledge
in
this
art
but
if
he
is
really
bent
on
finishing
it
himself
let
him
name
a
certain
time
and
if
you
are
convinced
that
he
means
to
do
it
let
him
have
all
the
reasonable
accommodations
he
may
ask
the
governor
replied
blessed
father
i
know
the
violent
temper
of
this
young
man
so
let
me
have
authority
to
give
him
a
sound
rating
after
my
own
the
pope
told
him
to
do
what
he
liked
with
words
though
he
was
sure
he
would
make
matters
worse
and
if
at
last
he
could
do
nothing
else
he
must
order
me
to
take
the
five
hundred
crowns
to
his
jeweller
pompeo
the
governor
returned
sent
for
me
into
his
cabinet
and
casting
one
of
his
glances
began
to
speak
as
follows
have
authority
to
loose
and
bind
the
whole
world
and
what
they
do
is
immediately
ratified
in
heaven
behold
your
box
then
which
has
been
opened
and
inspected
by
his
i
lifted
up
my
voice
at
once
and
said
thank
god
that
now
i
have
learned
and
can
report
what
the
faith
of
popes
is
made
then
the
governor
launched
out
into
brutal
bullying
words
and
gestures
but
perceiving
that
they
came
to
nothing
he
gave
up
his
attempt
as
desperate
and
spoke
in
somewhat
milder
tones
after
this
wise
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
are
so
blind
to
your
own
interest
but
since
it
is
so
go
and
take
the
five
hundred
crowns
when
you
think
fit
to
i
took
my
piece
up
went
away
and
carried
the
crowns
to
pompeo
on
the
instant
it
is
most
likely
that
the
pope
had
counted
on
some
want
of
money
or
other
opportunity
preventing
me
from
bringing
so
considerable
a
sum
at
once
and
was
anxious
in
this
way
to
repiece
the
broken
thread
of
my
obedience
when
then
he
saw
pompeo
coming
to
him
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
and
the
money
in
his
hand
he
soundly
rated
him
and
lamented
that
the
affair
had
turned
out
so
then
he
said
find
benvenuto
in
his
shop
and
treat
him
with
all
the
courtesies
of
which
your
ignorant
and
brutal
nature
is
capable
and
tell
him
that
if
he
is
willing
to
finish
that
piece
for
a
reliquary
to
hold
the
corpus
domini
when
i
walk
in
procession
i
will
allow
him
the
conveniences
he
wants
in
order
to
complete
it
provided
only
that
he
goes
on
pompeo
came
to
me
called
me
outside
the
shop
and
heaped
on
me
the
most
mawkish
caresses
of
a
donkey
reporting
everything
the
pope
had
ordered
i
lost
no
time
in
answering
that
greatest
treasure
i
could
wish
for
in
the
world
was
to
regain
the
favour
of
so
great
a
pope
which
had
been
lost
to
me
not
indeed
by
my
fault
but
by
the
fault
of
my
overwhelming
illness
and
the
wickedness
of
those
envious
men
who
take
pleasure
in
making
mischief
and
since
the
pope
has
plenty
of
servants
do
not
let
him
send
you
round
again
if
you
value
your
life
nay
look
well
to
your
safety
i
shall
not
fail
by
night
or
day
to
think
and
do
everything
i
can
in
the
service
and
bear
this
well
in
mind
that
when
you
have
reported
these
words
to
his
holiness
you
never
in
any
way
whatever
meddle
with
the
least
of
my
affairs
for
i
will
make
you
recognise
your
errors
by
the
punishment
they
the
fellow
related
everything
to
the
pope
but
in
far
more
brutal
terms
than
i
had
used
and
thus
the
matter
rested
for
a
time
while
i
again
attended
to
my
shop
and
business

the

meanwhile
worked
at
the
setting
and
the

of
the

the

commissioned
him
to
begin
the
chalice

had

came
to
show
him
what
he

done
he
was
very
discontented
and
greatly
regretted
that
he
had
broken
with
me
blaming
all
the
other
works
and
the
people
who
had
introduced
them
to
him
and
several
times
baccino
della
croce
came
from
him
to
tell
me
that
i
must
not
neglect
the
reliquary
i
answered
that
i
begged
his
holiness
to
let
me
breathe
a
little
after
the
great
illness
i
had
suffered
and
from
which
i
was
not
as
yet
wholly
free
adding
that
i
would
make
it
clear
to
him
that
all
the
hours
in
which
i
could
work
should
be
spent
in
his
service
i
had
indeed
begun
to
make
his
portrait
and
was
executing
a
medal
in
secret
i
fashioned
the
steel
dies
for
stamping
this
medal
in
my
own
house
while
i
kept
a
partner
in
my
workshop
who
had
been
my
prentice
and
was
called
felice
at
that
time
as
is
the
wont
of
young
men
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
sicilian
girl
who
was
exceedingly
beautiful
on
it
becoming
clear
that
she
returned
my
affection
her
mother
perceived
how
the
matter
stood
and
grew
suspicious
of
what
might
happen
the
truth
is
that
i
had
arranged
to
elope
with
the
girl
for
a
year
to
florence
unknown
to
her
mother
but
she
getting
wind
of
this
left
rome
secretly
one
night
and
went
off
in
the
direction
of
naples
she
gave
out
that
she
was
gone
by
civitŕ
vecchia
but
she
really
went
by
ostia
i
followed
them
to
civitŕ
vecchia
and
did
a
multitude
of
mad
things
to
discover
her
it
would
be
too
long
to
narrate
them
all
in
detail
enough
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
losing
my
wits
or
dying
after
two
months
she
wrote
to
me
that
she
was
in
sicily
extremely
unhappy
i
meanwhile
was
indulging
myself
in
all
the
pleasures
man
can
think
of
and
had
engaged
in
another
love
affair
merely
to
drown
the
memory
of
my
real
passion
lxiv
it
happened
through
a
variety
of
singular
accidents
that
i
became
intimate
with
a
sicilian
priest
who
was
a
man
of
very
elevated
genius
and
well
instructed
in
both
latin
and
greek
letters
in
the
course
of
conversation
one
day
we
were
led
to
talk
about
the
art
of
necromancy
apropos
of
which
i
said
my
whole
life
i
have
had
the
most
intense
desire
to
see
or
learn
something
of
this
thereto
the
priest
replied
stout
soul
and
a
steadfast
must
the
man
have
who
sets
himself
to
such
an
i
answered
that
of
strength
and
steadfastness
of
soul
i
should
have
enough
and
to
spare
provided
i
found
the
opportunity
then
the
priest
said
you
have
the
heart
to
dare
it
i
will
amply
satisfy
your
accordingly
we
agreed
upon
attempting
the
adventure
the
priest
one
evening
made
his
preparations
and
bade
me
find
a
comrade
or
not
more
than
two
i
invited
vincenzio
romoli
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
and
the
priest
took
with
him
a
native
of
pistoja
who
also
cultivated
the
black
art
we
went
together
to
the
coliseum
and
there
the
priest
having
arrayed
himself
in
robes
began
to
describe
circles
on
the
earth
with
the
finest
ceremonies
that
can
be
imagined
i
must
say
that
he
had
made
us
bring
precious
perfumes
and
fire
and
also
drugs
of
fetid
odour
when
the
preliminaries
were
completed
he
made
the
entrance
into
the
circle
and
taking
us
by
the
hand
introduced
us
one
by
one
inside
it
then
he
assigned
our
several
functions
to
the
necromancer
his
comrade
he
gave
the
pentacle
to
hold
the
other
two
of
us
had
to
look
after
the
fire
and
the
perfumes
and
then
he
began
his
incantations
this
lasted
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
when
several
legions
appeared
and
the
coliseum
was
all
full
of
devils
i
was
occupied
with
the
precious
perfumes
and
when
the
priest
perceived
in
what
numbers
they
were
present
he
turned
to
me
and
said
ask
them
i
called
on
them
to
reunite
me
with
my
sicilian
angelica
that
night
we
obtained
no
answer
but
i
enjoyed
the
greatest
satisfaction
of
my
curiosity
in
such
matters
the
necromancer
said
that
we
should
have
to
go
a
second
time
and
that
i
should
obtain
the
full
accomplishment
of
my
request
but
he
wished
me
to
bring
with
me
a
little
boy
of
pure
virginity
i
chose
one
of
my
who
was
about
twelve
years
old
and
invited
vincenzio
romoli
again
and
we
also
took
a
certain
agnolino
gaddi
who
was
a
very
intimate
friend
of
both
when
we
came
once
more
to
the
place
appointed
the
necromancer
made
just
the
same
preparations
attended
by
the
same
and
even
more
impressive
details
then
he
introduced
us
into
the
circle
which
he
had
reconstructed
with
art
more
admirable
and
yet
more
wondrous
ceremonies
afterwards
he
appointed
my
friend
vincenzio
to
the
ordering
of
the
perfumes
and
the
fire
and
with
him
agnolino
gaddi
he
next
placed
in
my
hand
the
pentacle
which
he
bid
me
turn
toward
the
points
he
indicated
and
under
the
pentacle
i
held
the
little
boy
my
workman
now
the
necromancer
began
to
utter
those
awful
invocations
calling
by
name
on
multitudes
of
demons
who
are
captains
of
their
legions
and
these
he
summoned
by
the
virtue
and
potency
of
god
the
uncreated
living
and
eternal
in
phrases
of
the
hebrew
and
also
of
the
greek
and
latin
tongues
insomuch
that
in
a
short
space
of
time
the
whole
coliseum
was
full
of
a
hundredfold
as
many
as
had
appeared
upon
the
first
occasion
vincenzio
romoli
together
with
agnolino
tended
the
fire
and
heaped
on
quantities
of
precious
perfumes
at
the
advice
of
the
necromancer
i
again
demanded
to
be
reunited
with
angelica
the
sorcerer
turned
to
me
and
said
you
what
they
have
replied
that
in
the
space
of
one
month
you
will
be
where
she
is
then
once
more
he
prayed
me
to
stand
firm
by
him
because
the
legions
were
a
thousandfold
more
than
he
had
summoned
and
were
the
most
dangerous
of
all
the
denizens
of
hell
and
now
that
they
had
settled
what
i
asked
it
behoved
us
to
be
civil
to
them
and
dismiss
them
gently
on
the
other
side
the
boy
who
was
beneath
the
pentacle
shrieked
out
in
terror
that
a
million
of
the
fiercest
men
were
swarming
round
and
threatening
us
he
said
moreover
that
four
huge
giants
had
appeared
who
were
striving
to
force
their
way
inside
the
circle
meanwhile
the
necromancer
trembling
with
fear
kept
doing
his
best
with
mild
and
soft
persuasions
to
dismiss
them
vincenzio
romoli
who
quaked
like
an
aspen
leaf
looked
after
the
perfumes
though
i
was
quite
as
frightened
as
the
rest
of
them
i
tried
to
show
it
less
and
inspired
them
all
with
marvellous
courage
but
the
truth
is
that
i
had
given
myself
up
for
dead
when
i
saw
the
terror
of
the
necromancer
the
boy
had
stuck
his
head
between
his
knees
exclaiming
is
how
i
will
meet
death
for
we
are
certainly
dead
again
i
said
to
him
creatures
are
all
inferior
to
us
and
what
you
see
is
only
smoke
and
shadow
so
then
raise
your
when
he
had
raised
them
he
cried
out
whole
coliseum
is
in
flames
and
the
fire
is
advancing
on
us
then
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
he
groaned
again
that
he
was
dead
and
that
he
could
not
endure
the
sight
longer
the
necromancer
appealed
for
my
support
entreating
me
to
stand
firm
by
him
and
to
have
assafetida
flung
upon
the
coals
so
i
turned
to
vincenzio
romoli
and
told
him
to
make
the
fumigation
at
once
while
uttering
these
words
i
looked
at
agnolino
gaddi
whose
eyes
were
starting
from
their
sockets
in
his
terror
and
who
was
more
than
half
dead
and
said
to
him
in
time
and
place
like
this
we
must
not
yield
to
fright
but
do
the
utmost
to
bestir
ourselves
therefore
up
at
once
and
fling
a
handful
of
that
assafetida
upon
the
agnolo
at
the
moment
when
he
moved
to
do
this
let
fly
such
a
volley
from
his
breech
that
it
was
far
more
effectual
than
the
assafetida
the
boy
roused
by
that
great
stench
and
noise
lifted
his
face
little
and
hearing
me
laugh
he
plucked
up
courage
and
said
the
devils
were
taking
to
flight
tempestuously
so
we
abode
thus
until
the
matinbells
began
to
sound
then
the
boy
told
us
again
that
but
few
remained
and
those
were
at
a
distance
when
the
necromancer
had
concluded
his
ceremonies
he
put
off
his
robe
and
packed
up
a
great
bundle
of
books
which
he
had
brought
with
him
then
all
together
we
issued
with
him
from
the
circle
huddling
as
close
as
we
could
to
one
another
especially
the
boy
who
had
got
into
the
middle
and
taken
the
necromancer
by
his
gown
and
me
by
the
cloak
all
the
while
that
we
were
going
toward
our
houses
in
the
banchi
he
kept
saying
that
two
of
the
devils
he
had
seen
in
the
coliseum
were
gamboling
in
front
of
us
skipping
now
along
the
roofs
and
now
upon
the
ground
the
necromancer
assured
me
that
often
as
he
had
entered
magic
circles
he
had
never
met
with
such
a
serious
affair
as
this
he
also
tried
to
persuade
me
to
assist
him
in
consecrating
a
book
by
means
of
which
we
should
extract
immeasurable
wealth
since
we
could
call
up
fiends
to
show
us
where
treasures
were
whereof
the
earth
is
full
and
after
this
wise
we
should
become
the
richest
of
mankind
love
affairs
like
mine
were
nothing
but
vanities
and
follies
without
consequence
i
replied
that
if
i
were
a
latin
scholar
i
should
be
very
willing
to
do
what
he
suggested
he
continued
to
persuade
me
by
arguing
that
latin
scholarship
was
of
no
importance
and
that
if
he
wanted
he
could
have
found
plenty
of
good
latinists
but
that
he
had
never
met
with
a
man
of
soul
so
firm
as
mine
and
that
i
ought
to
follow
his
counsel
engaged
in
this
conversation
we
reached
our
homes
and
each
one
of
us
dreamed
all
that
night
of
devils
note
una
istrombazzata
di
coregge
con
tanta
abundanzia
di
merda
lxv
as
we
were
in
the
habit
of
meeting
daily
the
necromancer
kept
urging
me
to
join
in
his
adventure
accordingly
i
asked
him
how
long
it
would
take
and
where
we
should
have
to
go
to
this
he
answered
that
we
might
get
through
with
it
in
less
than
a
month
and
that
the
most
suitable
locality
for
the
purpose
was
the
hill
country
of
norcia
a
master
of
his
in
the
art
had
indeed
consecrated
such
a
book
quite
close
to
rome
at
a
place
called
the
badia
di
farfa
but
he
had
met
with
some
difficulties
there
which
would
not
occur
in
the
mountains
of
norcia
the
peasants
also
of
that
district
are
people
to
be
trusted
and
have
some
practice
in
these
matters
so
that
at
a
pinch
they
are
able
to
render
valuable
assistance
this
priestly
sorcerer
moved
me
so
by
his
persuasions
that
i
was
well
disposed
to
comply
with
his
request
but
i
said
i
wanted
first
to
finish
the
medals
i
was
making
for
the
pope
i
had
confided
what
i
was
doing
about
them
to
him
alone
begging
him
to
keep
my
secret
at
the
same
time
i
never
stopped
asking
him
if
he
believed
that
i
should
be
reunited
to
my
sicilian
angelica
at
the
time
appointed
for
the
date
was
drawing
near
and
i
thought
it
singular
that
i
heard
nothing
about
her
the
necromancer
told
me
that
it
was
quite
certain
i
should
find
myself
where
she
was
since
the
devils
never
break
their
word
when
they
promise
as
they
did
on
that
occasion
but
he
bade
me
keep
my
eyes
open
and
be
on
the
look
out
against
some
accident
which
might
happen
to
me
in
that
connection
and
put
restraint
upon
myself
to
endure
somewhat
against
my
inclination
for
he
could
discern
a
great
and
imminent
danger
in
it
well
would
it
be
for
me
if
i
went
with
him
to
consecrate
the
book
since
this
would
avert
the
peril
that
menaced
me
and
would
make
us
both
most
fortunate
i
was
beginning
to
hanker
after
the
adventure
more
than
he
did
but
i
said
that
a
certain
maestro
giovanni
of
castel
bolognese
had
just
come
to
rome
very
ingenious
in
the
art
of
making
medals
of
the
sort
i
made
in
steel
and
that
i
thirsted
for
nothing
more
than
to
compete
with
him
and
take
the
world
by
storm
with
some
great
masterpiece
which
i
hoped
would
annihilate
all
those
enemies
of
mine
by
the
force
of
genius
and
not
the
sword
the
sorcerer
on
his
side
went
on
urging
prithee
benvenuto
come
with
me
and
shun
a
great
disaster
which
i
see
impending
over
however
i
had
made
my
mind
up
come
what
would
to
finish
my
medal
and
we
were
now
approaching
the
end
of
the
month
i
was
so
absorbed
and
enamoured
by
my
work
that
i
thought
no
more
about
angelica
or
anything
of
that
kind
but
gave
my
whole
self
up
to
it
note
this
district
of
the
central
apennines
was
always
famous
for
witches
poisoners
and
so
forth
the
farfa
mentioned
below
is
a
village
of
the
sabine
hills
note
gio
bernardi
had
been
in
the
duke
of
service
giovio
brought
him
to
rome
where
he
was
patronised
by
the
cardinals
salviati
and
medici
he
made
a
famous
medal
of
clement
and
was
a
pontifical
he
died
at
faenza
in
lxvi
it
happened
one
day
close
on
the
hours
of
vespers
that
i
had
to
go
at
an
unusual
time
for
me
from
my
house
to
my
workshop
for
i
ought
to
say
that
the
latter
was
in
the
banchi
while
i
lived
behind
the
banchi
and
went
rarely
to
the
shop
all
my
business
there
i
left
in
the
hands
of
my
partner
felice
having
stayed
a
short
while
in
the
workshop
i
remembered
that
i
had
to
say
something
to
alessandro
del
bene
so
i
arose
and
when
i
reached
the
banchi
i
met
a
man
called
ser
benedetto
who
was
a
great
friend
of
mine
he
was
a
notary
born
in
florence
son
of
a
blind
man
who
said
prayers
about
the
streets
for
alms
and
a
sienese
by
race
this
ser
benedetto
had
been
very
many
years
at
naples
afterwards
he
had
settled
in
rome
where
he
transacted
business
for
some
sienese
merchants
of
the
chigi
my
partner
had
over
and
over
again
asked
him
for
some
moneys
which
were
due
for
certain
little
rings
confided
to
ser
benedetto
that
very
day
meeting
him
in
the
banchi
he
demanded
his
money
rather
roughly
as
his
wont
was
benedetto
was
walking
with
his
masters
and
they
annoyed
by
the
interruption
scolded
him
sharply
saying
they
would
be
served
by
somebody
else
in
order
not
to
have
to
listen
to
such
barking
ser
benedetto
did
the
best
he
could
to
excuse
himself
swore
that
he
had
paid
the
goldsmith
and
said
he
had
no
power
to
curb
the
rage
of
madmen
the
sienese
took
his
words
ill
and
dismissed
him
on
the
spot
leaving
them
he
ran
like
an
arrow
to
my
shop
probably
to
take
revenge
upon
felice
it
chanced
that
just
in
the
middle
of
the
street
we
met
i
who
had
heard
nothing
of
the
matter
greeted
him
most
kindly
according
to
my
custom
to
which
courtesy
he
replied
with
insults
then
what
the
sorcerer
had
said
flashed
all
at
once
upon
my
mind
and
bridling
myself
as
well
as
i
was
able
in
the
way
he
bade
me
i
answered
brother
benedetto
fly
into
a
rage
with
me
for
i
have
done
you
no
harm
nor
do
i
know
anything
about
these
affairs
of
yours
please
go
and
finish
what
you
have
to
do
with
felice
he
is
quite
capable
of
giving
you
a
proper
answer
but
inasmuch
as
i
know
nothing
about
it
you
are
wrong
to
abuse
me
in
this
way
especially
as
you
are
well
aware
that
i
am
not
the
man
to
put
up
with
he
retorted
that
i
knew
everything
and
that
he
was
the
man
to
make
me
bear
a
heavier
load
than
that
and
that
felice
and
i
were
two
great
rascals
by
this
time
a
crowd
had
gathered
round
to
hear
the
quarrel
provoked
by
his
ugly
words
i
stooped
and
took
up
a
lump
of
it
had
hurled
it
with
a
quick
and
unpremeditated
movement
at
his
face
he
ducked
his
head
so
that
the
mud
hit
him
in
the
middle
of
the
skull
there
was
a
stone
in
it
with
several
sharp
angles
one
of
which
striking
him
he
fell
stunned
like
a
dead
man
whereupon
all
the
bystanders
seeing
the
great
quantity
of
blood
judged
that
he
was
really
dead
note
the
has
figi
but
this
is
probably
a
mistake
of
the
amanuensis
lxvii
while
he
was
still
lying
on
the
ground
and
people
were
preparing
to
carry
him
away
pompeo
the
jeweller
passed
by
the
pope
had
sent
for
him
to
give
orders
about
some
jewels
seeing
the
fellow
in
such
a
miserable
plight
he
asked
who
had
struck
him
on
which
they
told
him
did
it
but
the
stupid
creature
brought
it
down
upon
no
sooner
had
pompeo
reached
the
pope
than
he
began
to
speak
blessed
father
benvenuto
has
this
very
moment
murdered
tobbia
i
saw
it
with
my
own
on
this
the
pope
in
a
fury
ordered
the
governor
who
was
in
the
presence
to
take
and
hang
me
at
once
in
the
place
where
the
homicide
had
been
committed
adding
that
he
must
do
all
he
could
to
catch
me
and
not
appear
again
before
him
until
he
had
hanged
me
when
i
saw
the
unfortunate
benedetto
stretched
upon
the
ground
i
thought
at
once
of
the
peril
i
was
in
considering
the
power
of
my
enemies
and
what
might
ensue
from
this
disaster
making
off
i
took
refuge
in
the
house
of
messer
giovanni
gaddi
clerk
of
the
camera
with
the
intention
of
preparing
as
soon
as
possible
to
escape
from
rome
he
however
advised
me
not
to
be
in
such
a
hurry
for
it
might
turn
out
perhaps
that
the
evil
was
not
so
great
as
i
imagined
and
calling
messer
annibal
caro
who
lived
with
him
bade
him
go
for
information
while
these
arrangements
were
being
made
a
roman
gentleman
appeared
who
belonged
to
the
household
of
cardinal
medici
and
had
been
sent
by
him
taking
messer
giovanni
and
me
apart
he
told
us
that
the
cardinal
had
reported
to
him
what
the
pope
said
and
that
there
was
no
way
of
helping
me
out
of
the
scrape
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
shun
the
first
fury
of
the
storm
by
flight
and
not
to
risk
myself
in
any
house
in
rome
upon
this
departure
messer
giovanni
looked
me
in
the
face
as
though
he
were
about
to
cry
and
said
me
ah
woe
is
me
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
to
aid
you
i
replied
means
i
shall
aid
myself
alone
only
i
request
you
to
put
one
of
your
horses
at
my
they
had
already
saddled
a
black
turkish
horse
the
finest
and
the
best
in
rome
i
mounted
with
an
arquebuse
upon
the
wound
up
in
readiness
to
fire
if
need
were
when
i
reached
ponte
sisto
i
found
the
whole
of
the
guard
there
both
horse
and
foot
so
making
a
virtue
of
necessity
i
put
my
horse
boldly
to
a
sharp
trot
and
with
grace
being
somehow
unperceived
by
them
passed
freely
through
then
with
all
the
speed
i
could
i
took
the
road
to
palombara
a
fief
of
my
lord
giovanbatista
savello
whence
i
sent
the
horse
back
to
messer
giovanni
without
however
thinking
it
well
to
inform
him
where
i
was
lord
giovanbatista
after
very
kindly
entertaining
me
two
days
advised
me
to
remove
and
go
toward
naples
till
the
storm
blew
over
so
providing
me
with
company
he
set
me
on
the
way
to
naples
while
travelling
i
met
a
sculptor
of
my
acquaintance
who
was
going
to
san
germano
to
finish
the
tomb
of
piero
medici
at
monte
cassino
his
name
was
solosmeo
and
he
gave
me
the
news
that
on
the
very
evening
of
the
fray
pope
clement
sent
one
of
his
chamberlains
to
inquire
how
tobbia
was
getting
on
finding
him
at
work
unharmed
and
without
even
knowing
anything
about
the
matter
the
messenger
went
back
and
told
the
pope
who
turned
round
to
pompeo
and
said
are
a
rascal
but
i
promise
you
well
that
you
have
stirred
a
snake
up
which
will
sting
you
and
serve
you
right
then
he
addressed
himself
to
cardinal
medici
and
commissioned
him
to
look
after
me
adding
that
he
should
be
very
sorry
to
let
me
slip
through
his
fingers
and
so
solosmeo
and
i
went
on
our
way
singing
toward
monte
cassino
intending
to
pursue
our
journey
thence
in
company
toward
naples
note
ippolito
medici
was
a
cardinal
much
against
his
natural
inclination
when
he
went
as
papal
legate
to
hungary
in
he
assumed
the
airs
and
style
of
a
condottiere
his
jealousy
of
his
cousin
alessandro
led
to
his
untimely
death
by
poison
in
note
the
gun
was
an
a

which
had
a

the
exiled

when
they
regained

the
work
was
begun
in
solosmeo
appears
from
this
passage
in
cellini
to
have
taken
the
execution
of
it
over
lxviii
when
solosmeo
had
inspected
his
affairs
at
monte
cassino
we
resumed
our
journey
and
having
come
within
a
mile
of
naples
we
were
met
by
an
innkeeper
who
invited
us
to
his
house
and
said
he
had
been
at
florence
many
years
with
carlo
ginori
adding
that
if
we
put
up
at
his
inn
he
would
treat
us
most
kindly
for
the
reason
that
we
both
were
florentines
we
told
him
frequently
that
we
did
not
want
to
go
to
him
however
he
kept
passing
sometimes
in
front
and
sometimes
behind
perpetually
repeating
that
he
would
have
us
stop
at
his
hostelry
when
this
began
to
bore
me
i
asked
if
he
could
tell
me
anything
about
a
certain
sicilian
woman
called
beatrice
who
had
a
beautiful
daughter
named
angelica
and
both
were
courtesans
taking
it
into
his
head
that
i
was
jeering
him
he
cried
out
send
mischief
to
all
courtesans
and
such
as
favour
them
then
he
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
made
off
as
though
he
was
resolved
to
leave
us
i
felt
some
pleasure
at
having
rid
myself
in
so
fair
a
manner
of
that
ass
of
an
innkeeper
and
yet
i
was
rather
the
loser
than
the
gainer
for
the
great
love
i
bore
angelica
had
come
back
to
my
mind
and
while
i
was
conversing
not
without
some
sighs
upon
this
subject
with
solosmeo
we
saw
the
man
returning
to
us
at
a
gallop
when
he
drew
up
he
said
or
perhaps
three
days
ago
a
woman
and
a
girl
came
back
to
a
house
in
my
neighbourhood
they
had
the
names
you
mentioned
but
whether
they
are
sicilians
i
can
not
i
answered
power
over
me
has
that
name
of
angelica
that
i
am
now
determined
to
put
up
at
your
we
rode
on
all
together
with
mine
host
into
the
town
of
naples
and
descended
at
his
house
minutes
seemed
years
to
me
till
i
had
put
my
things
in
order
which
i
did
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
then
i
went
to
the
house
which
was
not
far
from
our
inn
and
found
there
my
angelica
who
greeted
me
with
infinite
demonstrations
of
the
most
unbounded
passion
i
stayed
with
her
from
evenfall
until
the
following
morning
and
enjoyed
such
pleasure
as
i
never
had
before
or
since
but
while
drinking
deep
of
this
delight
it
occurred
to
my
mind
how
exactly
on
that
day
the
month
expired
which
had
been
prophesied
within
the
necromantic
circle
by
the
devils
so
then
let
every
man
who
enters
into
relation
with
those
spirits
weigh
well
the
inestimable
perils
i
have
passed
through
note
a
gonfalonier
of
the
republic
in
lxix
i
happened
to
have
in
my
purse
a
diamond
which
i
showed
about
among
the
goldsmiths
and
though
i
was
but
young
my
reputation
as
an
able
artist
was
so
well
known
even
at
naples
that
they
welcomed
me
most
warmly
among
others
i
made
acquaintance
with
a
most
excellent
companion
a
jeweller
messer
domenico
fontana
by
name
this
worthy
man
left
his
shop
for
the
three
days
that
i
spent
in
naples
nor
even
quitted
my
company
but
showed
me
many
admirable
monuments
of
antiquity
in
the
city
and
its
neigbourhood
moreover
he
took
me
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
viceroy
of
naples
who
had
let
him
know
that
he
should
like
to
see
me
when
i
presented
myself
to
his
excellency
he
received
me
with
much
honour
and
while
we
were
exchanging
compliments
the
diamond
which
i
have
mentioned
caught
his
eye
he
made
me
show
it
him
and
prayed
me
if
i
parted
with
it
to
give
him
the
refusal
having
taken
back
the
stone
i
offered
it
again
to
his
excellency
adding
that
the
diamond
and
i
were
at
his
service
then
he
said
that
the
diamond
pleased
him
well
but
that
he
should
be
much
better
pleased
if
i
were
to
stay
with
him
he
would
make
such
terms
with
me
as
would
cause
me
to
feel
satisfied
we
spoke
many
words
of
courtesy
on
both
sides
and
then
coming
to
the
merits
of
the
diamond
his
excellency
bade
me
without
hesitation
name
the
price
at
which
i
valued
it
accordingly
i
said
that
it
was
worth
exactly
two
hundred
crowns
he
rejoined
that
in
his
opinion
i
had
not
overvalued
it
but
that
since
i
had
set
it
and
he
knew
me
for
the
first
artist
in
the
world
it
would
not
make
the
same
effect
when
mounted
by
another
hand
to
this
i
said
that
i
had
not
set
the
stone
and
that
it
was
not
well
set
its
brilliancy
was
due
to
its
own
excellence
and
that
if
i
were
to
mount
it
afresh
i
could
make
it
show
far
better
than
it
did
then
i
put
my
to
the
angels
of
its
facets
took
it
from
the
ring
cleaned
it
up
a
little
and
handed
it
to
the
viceroy
delighted
and
astonished
he
wrote
me
out
a
cheque
for
the
two
hundred
crowns
i
had
demanded
when
i
returned
to
my
lodging
i
found
letters
from
the
cardinal
medici
in
which
he
told
me
to
come
back
to
rome
and
to
dismount
without
delay
at
the
palace
of
his
most
reverend
lordship
i
read
the
letter
to
my
angelica
who
begged
me
with
tears
of
affection
either
to
remain
in
naples
or
to
take
her
with
me
i
replied
that
if
she
was
disposed
to
come
with
me
i
would
give
up
to
her
keeping
the
two
hundred
ducats
i
had
received
from
the
viceroy
her
mother
perceiving
us
in
this
close
conversation
drew
nigh
and
said
if
you
want
to
take
my
daughter
to
rome
leave
me
a
sum
of
fifteen
ducats
to
pay
for
my
and
then
i
will
travel
after
i
told
the
old
harridan
that
i
would
very
gladly
leave
her
thirty
if
she
would
give
me
my
angelica
we
made
the
bargain
and
angelica
entreated
me
to
by
her
a
gown
of
black
velvet
because
the
stuff
was
cheap
at
naples
i
consented
to
everything
sent
for
the
velvet
settled
its
price
and
paid
for
it
then
the
old
woman
who
thought
me
over
head
and
ears
in
love
begged
for
a
gown
of
fine
cloth
for
herself
as
well
as
other
outlays
for
her
sons
and
a
good
bit
more
money
than
i
had
offered
i
turned
to
her
with
a
pleasant
air
and
said
dear
beatrice
are
you
satisfied
with
what
i
offered
she
answered
that
she
was
not
thereupon
i
said
that
what
was
not
enough
for
her
would
be
quite
enough
for
me
and
having
kissed
angelica
we
parted
she
with
tears
and
i
with
laughter
and
off
at
once
i
set
for
rome
note
the
spanish
viceroy
was
at
this
time
pietro
alvarez
de
toledo
marquis
of
villafranca
and
uncle
of
the
famous
duke
of
alva
he
governed
naples
for
twenty
years
from
onwards
note
fece
una
polizza
a
was
an
order
for
money
practically
identical
with
our
lxx
i
left
naples
by
night
with
my
money
in
my
pocket
and
this
i
did
to
prevent
being
set
upon
or
murdered
as
is
the
way
there
but
when
i
came
to
selciata
i
had
to
defend
myself
with
great
address
and
bodily
prowess
from
several
horsemen
who
came
out
to
assassinate
me
during
the
following
days
after
leaving
solosmeo
at
his
work
in
monte
cassino
i
came
one
morning
to
breakfast
at
the
inn
of
adanagni
and
when
i
was
near
the
house
i
shot
some
birds
with
my
arquebuse
an
iron
spike
which
was
in
the
lock
of
my
musket
tore
my
right
hand
though
the
wound
was
not
of
any
consequence
it
seemed
to
be
so
because
it
bled
abundantly
going
into
the
inn
i
put
my
horse
up
and
ascended
to
a
large
gallery
where
i
found
a
party
of
neapolitan
gentlemen
just
upon
the
point
of
sitting
down
to
table
they
had
with
them
a
young
woman
of
quality
the
loveliest
i
ever
saw
at
the
moment
when
i
entered
the
room
i
was
followed
by
a
very
brave
young
of
mine
holding
a
big
partisan
in
his
hand
the
sight
of
us
our
arms
and
the
blood
inspired
those
poor
gentlemen
with
such
terror
particularly
as
the
place
was
known
to
be
a
nest
of
murderers
that
they
rose
from
table
and
called
on
god
in
a
panic
to
protect
them
i
began
to
laugh
and
said
that
god
had
protected
them
already
for
that
i
was
a
man
to
defend
them
against
whoever
tried
to
do
them
harm
then
i
asked
them
for
something
to
bind
up
my
wounded
hand
and
the
charming
lady
took
out
a
handkerchief
richly
embroidered
with
gold
wishing
to
make
a
bandage
with
it
i
refused
but
she
tore
the
piece
in
half
and
in
the
gentlest
manner
wrapt
my
hand
up
with
her
fingers
the
company
thus
having
regained
confidence
we
dined
together
very
gaily
and
when
the
meal
was
over
we
all
mounted
and
went
off
together
the
gentlemen
however
were
not
as
yet
quite
at
their
ease
so
they
left
me
in
their
cunning
to
entertain
the
lady
while
they
kept
at
a
short
distance
behind
i
rode
at
her
side
upon
a
pretty
little
horse
of
mine
making
signs
to
my
servant
that
he
should
keep
somewhat
apart
which
gave
us
the
opportunity
of
discussing
things
that
are
not
sold
by
the
apothecary
in
this
way
i
journeyed
to
rome
with
the
greatest
enjoyment
i
have
ever
had
when
i
got
to
rome
i
dismounted
at
the
palace
of
cardinal
medici
and
having
obtained
an
audience
of
his
most
reverend
lordship
paid
my
respects
and
thanked
him
warmly
for
my
recall
i
then
entreated
him
to
secure
me
from
imprisonment
and
even
from
a
fine
if
that
were
possible
the
cardinal
was
very
glad
to
see
me
told
me
to
stand
in
no
fear
then
turned
to
one
of
his
gentlemen
called
messer
pier
antonio
pecci
of
siena
ordering
him
to
tell
the
bargello
not
to
touch
me
he
then
asked
him
how
the
man
was
going
on
whose
head
i
had
broken
with
the
stone
messer
pier
antonio
replied
that
he
was
very
ill
and
that
he
would
probably
be
even
worse
for
when
he
heard
that
i
was
coming
back
to
rome
he
swore
he
would
die
to
serve
me
an
ill
turn
when
the
cardinal
heard
that
he
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
and
cried
fellow
could
not
have
taken
a
better
way
than
this
to
make
us
know
that
he
was
born
a
after
that
he
turned
to
me
and
said
our
reputation
and
your
own
refrain
these
four
or
five
days
from
going
about
in
the
banchi
after
that
go
where
you
like
and
let
fools
die
at
their
own
i
went
home
and
set
myself
to
finishing
the
medal
which
i
had
begun
with
the
head
of
pope
clement
and
a
figure
of
peace
on
the
reverse
the
figure
was
a
slender
woman
dressed
in
very
thin
drapery
gathered
at
the
waist
with
a
little
torch
in
her
hand
which
was
burning
a
heap
of
arms
bound
together
like
a
trophy
in
the
background
i
had
shown
part
of
a
temple
where
was
discord
chained
with
a
load
of
fetters
round
about
it
ran
a
legend
in
these
words
belli
portć
during
the
time
that
i
was
finishing
this
medal
the
man
whom
i
had
wounded
recovered
and
the
pope
kept
incessantly
asking
for
me
i
however
avoided
visiting
cardinal
medici
for
whenever
i
showed
my
face
before
him
his
lordship
gave
me
some
commission
of
importance
which
hindered
me
from
working
at
my
medal
to
the
end
consequently
messer
pier
carnesecchi
who
was
a
great
favourite
of
the
undertook
to
keep
me
in
sight
and
let
me
adroitly
understand
how
much
the
pope
desired
my
services
i
told
him
that
in
a
few
days
i
would
prove
to
his
holiness
that
his
service
had
never
been
neglected

me

august
lxxi
not
many
days
had
passed
before
my
medal
being
finished
i
stamped
it
in
gold
silver
and
copper
after
i
had
shown
it
to
messer
pietro
he
immediately
introduced
me
to
the
pope
it
was
on
a
day
in
april
after
dinner
and
the
weather
very
fine
the
pope
was
in
the
belvedere
after
entering
the
presence
i
put
my
medals
together
with
the
dies
of
steel
into
his
hand
he
took
them
and
recognising
at
once
their
mastery
of
art
looked
messer
pietro
in
the
face
and
said
ancients
never
had
such
medals
made
for
them
as
while
he
and
the
others
were
inspecting
them
taking
up
now
the
dies
and
now
the
medals
in
their
hands
i
began
to
speak
as
submissively
as
i
was
able
a
greater
power
had
not
controlled
the
working
of
my
inauspicious
stars
and
hindered
that
with
which
they
violently
menaced
me
your
holiness
without
your
fault
or
mine
would
have
lost
a
faithful
and
loving
servant
it
must
most
blessed
father
be
allowed
that
in
those
cases
where
men
are
risking
all
upon
one
throw
it
is
not
wrong
to
do
as
certain
poor
and
simple
men
are
wont
to
say
who
tell
us
we
must
mark
seven
times
and
cut
once
your
holiness
will
remember
how
the
malicious
and
lying
tongue
of
my
bitter
enemy
so
easily
aroused
your
anger
that
you
ordered
the
governor
to
have
me
taken
on
the
spot
and
hanged
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
when
you
had
become
aware
of
the
irreparable
act
by
which
you
would
have
wronged
yourself
in
cutting
off
from
you
a
servant
such
as
even
now
your
holiness
hath
said
he
is
i
am
sure
i
repeat
that
before
god
and
the
world
you
would
have
felt
no
trifling
twinges
of
remorse
excellent
and
virtuous
fathers
and
masters
of
like
quality
ought
not
to
let
their
arm
in
wrath
descend
upon
their
sons
and
servants
with
such
inconsiderate
haste
seeing
that
subsequent
repentance
will
avail
them
nothing
but
now
that
god
has
overruled
the
malign
influences
of
the
stars
and
saved
me
for
your
holiness
i
humbly
beg
you
another
time
not
to
let
yourself
so
easily
be
stirred
to
rage
against
the
pope
had
stopped
from
looking
at
the
medals
and
was
now
listening
attentively
to
what
i
said
there
were
many
noblemen
of
the
greatest
consequence
present
which
made
him
blush
a
little
as
it
were
for
shame
and
not
knowing
how
else
to
extricate
himself
from
this
entanglement
he
said
that
he
could
not
remember
having
given
such
an
order
i
changed
the
conversation
in
order
to
cover
his
embarrassment
his
holiness
then
began
to
speak
again
about
the
medals
and
asked
what
method
i
had
used
to
stamp
them
so
marvelously
large
as
they
were
for
he
had
never
met
with
ancient
pieces
of
that
size
we
talked
a
little
on
this
subject
but
being
not
quite
easy
that
i
might
not
begin
another
lecture
sharper
than
the
last
he
praised
my
medals
and
said
they
gave
him
the
greatest
satisfaction
but
that
he
should
like
another
reverse
made
according
to
a
fancy
of
his
own
if
it
were
possible
to
stamp
them
with
two
different
patterns
i
said
that
it
was
possible
to
do
so
then
his
holiness
commissioned
me
to
design
the
history
of
moses
when
he
strikes
the
rock
and
water
issues
from
it
with
this
motto
bibat
populus
at
last
he
added
benvenuto
you
will
not
have
finished
it
before
i
have
provided
for
your
after
i
had
taken
leave
the
pope
proclaimed
before
the
whole
company
that
he
would
give
me
enough
to
live
on
wealthily
without
the
need
of
labouring
for
any
one
but
him
so
i
devoted
myself
entirely
to
working
out
this
reverse
with
the
moses
on
it
note
sette
e
tagliar
uno
a
proverb
derived
possibly
from
felling
trees
or
as
some
commentators
interpret
from
the
points
made
by
sculptors
on
their
marble
before
they
block
the
statue
out
note
the
medal
commemorated
a
deep
well
sunk
by
clement
at
orvieto
lxxii
in
the
meantime
the
pope
was
taken
ill
and
his
physicians
thought
the
case
was
dangerous
accordingly
my
enemy
began
to
be
afraid
of
me
and
engaged
some
neapolitan
soldiers
to
do
to
me
what
he
was
dreading
i
might
do
to
him
i
had
therefore
much
trouble
to
defend
my
poor
life
in
course
of
time
however
i
completed
the
reverse
and
when
i
took
it
to
the
pope
i
found
him
in
bed
in
a
most
deplorable
condition
nevertheless
he
received
me
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
wished
to
inspect
the
medals
and
the
dies
he
sent
for
spectacles
and
lights
but
was
unable
to
see
anything
clearly
then
he
began
to
fumble
with
his
fingers
at
them
and
having
felt
them
a
short
while
he
fetched
a
deep
sigh
and
said
to
his
attendants
that
he
was
much
concerned
about
me
but
that
if
god
gave
him
back
his
health
he
would
make
it
all
right
three
days
afterwards
the
pope
died
and
i
was
left
with
all
my
labour
lost
yet
i
plucked
up
courage
and
told
myself
that
these
medals
had
won
me
so
much
celebrity
that
any
pope
who
was
elected
would
give
me
work
to
do
and
peradventure
bring
me
better
fortune
thus
i
encouraged
and
put
heart
into
myself
and
buried
in
oblivion
all
the
injuries
which
pompeo
had
done
me
then
putting
on
my
arms
and
girding
my
sword
i
went
to
san
piero
and
kissed
the
feet
of
the
dead
pope
not
without
shedding
tears
afterwards
i
returned
to
the
banchi
to
look
on
at
the
great
commotion
which
always
happens
on
such
occasions
while
i
was
sitting
in
the
street
with
several
of
my
friends
pompeo
went
by
attended
by
ten
men
very
well
armed
and
when
he
came
just
opposite
he
stopped
as
though
about
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
myself
my
companions
brave
and
adventurous
young
men
made
signs
to
me
to
draw
my
sword
but
it
flashed
through
my
mind
that
if
i
drew
some
terrible
mischief
might
result
for
persons
who
were
wholly
innocent
therefore
i
considered
that
it
would
be
better
if
i
put
my
life
to
risk
alone
when
pompeo
had
stood
there
time
enough
to
say
two
ave
marias
he
laughed
derisively
in
my
direction
and
going
off
his
fellows
also
laughed
and
wagged
their
heads
with
many
other
insolent
gestures
my
companions
wanted
to
begin
the
fray
at
once
but
i
told
them
hotly
that
i
was
quite
able
to
conduct
my
quarrels
to
an
end
by
myself
and
that
i
had
no
need
of
stouter
fighters
than
i
was
so
that
each
of
them
might
mind
his
business
my
friends
were
angry
and
went
off
muttering
now
there
was
among
them
my
dearest
comrade
named
albertaccio
del
bene
own
brother
to
alessandro
and
albizzo
who
is
now
a
very
rich
man
in
lyons
he
was
the
most
redoubtable
young
man
i
ever
knew
and
the
most
and
loved
me
like
himself
and
insomuch
as
he
was
well
aware
that
my
forbearance
had
not
been
inspired
by
want
of
courage
but
by
the
most
daring
bravery
for
he
knew
me
down
to
the
bottom
of
my
nature
he
took
my
words
up
and
begged
me
to
favour
him
so
far
as
to
associate
him
with
myself
in
all
i
meant
to
do
i
replied
albertaccio
dearest
to
me
above
all
men
that
live
the
time
will
very
likely
come
when
you
shall
give
me
aid
but
in
this
case
if
you
love
me
do
not
attend
to
me
but
look
to
your
own
business
and
go
at
once
like
our
other
friends
for
now
there
is
no
time
to
these
words
were
spoken
in
one
breath
note
the
meaning
of
this
is
that
if
clement
died
cellini
would
have
had
his
opportunity
of
vengeance
during
the
anarchy
which
followed
a
vacancy
of
the
papal
see
lxxiii
in
the
meanwhile
my
enemies
had
proceeded
slowly
toward
chiavica
as
the
place
was
called
and
had
arrived
at
the
crossing
of
several
roads
going
in
different
directions
but
the
street
in
which
house
stood
was
the
one
which
leads
straight
to
the
campo
di
fiore
some
business
or
other
made
him
enter
the
shop
which
stood
at
the
corner
of
chiavica
and
there
he
stayed
a
while
transacting
it
i
had
just
been
told
that
he
had
boasted
of
the
insult
which
he
fancied
he
had
put
upon
me
but
be
that
as
it
may
it
was
to
his
misfortune
for
precisely
when
i
came
up
to
the
corner
he
was
leaving
the
shop
and
his
bravi
had
opened
their
ranks
and
received
him
in
their
midst
i
drew
a
little
dagger
with
a
sharpened
edge
and
breaking
the
line
of
his
defenders
laid
my
hands
upon
his
breast
so
quickly
and
coolly
that
none
of
them
were
able
to
prevent
me
then
i
aimed
to
strike
him
in
the
face
but
fright
made
him
turn
his
head
round
and
i
stabbed
him
just
beneath
the
ear
i
only
gave
two
blows
for
he
fell
stone
dead
at
the
second
i
had
not
meant
to
kill
him
but
as
the
saying
goes
knocks
are
not
dealt
by
measure
with
my
left
hand
i
plucked
back
the
dagger
and
with
my
right
hand
drew
my
sword
to
defend
my
life
however
all
those
bravi
ran
up
to
the
corpse
and
took
no
action
against
me
so
i
went
back
alone
through
strada
giulia
considering
how
best
to
put
myself
in
safety
i
had
walked
about
three
hundred
paces
when
piloto
the
goldsmith
my
very
good
friend
came
up
and
said
now
that
the
done
we
must
see
to
saving
i
replied
us
go
to
albertaccio
del
house
it
is
only
a
few
minutes
since
i
told
him
i
should
soon
have
need
of
when
we
arrived
there
albertaccio
and
i
embraced
with
measureless
affection
and
soon
the
whole
flower
of
the
young
men
of
the
banchi
of
all
nations
except
the
milanese
came
crowding
in
and
each
and
all
made
proffer
of
their
own
life
to
save
mine
messer
luigi
rucellai
also
sent
with
marvellous
promptitude
and
courtesy
to
put
his
services
at
my
disposal
as
did
many
other
great
folk
of
his
station
for
they
all
agreed
in
blessing
my
hands
judging
that
pompeo
had
done
me
too
great
and
unforgivable
an
injury
and
marvelling
that
i
had
put
up
with
him
so
long
note
mi
benedissono
le
mani
this
is
tantamount
to
approving
handiwork
in
murdering
pompeo
lxxiv
cardinal
cornaro
on
hearing
of
the
affair
despatched
thirty
soldiers
with
as
many
partisans
pikes
and
arquebuses
to
bring
me
with
all
due
respect
to
his
quarters
this
he
did
unasked
whereupon
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
went
off
with
them
while
more
than
as
many
of
the
young
men
bore
me
company
meanwhile
messer
traiano
relative
and
first
chamberlain
to
the
pope
sent
a
milanese
of
high
rank
to
cardinal
medici
giving
him
news
of
the
great
crime
i
had
committed
and
calling
on
his
most
reverend
lordship
to
chastise
me
the
cardinal
retorted
on
the
spot
crime
would
indeed
have
been
great
if
he
had
not
committed
this
lesser
one
thank
messer
traiano
from
me
for
giving
me
this
information
of
a
fact
of
which
i
had
not
heard
then
he
turned
and
in
presence
of
the
nobleman
said
to
the
bishop
of
frulli
his
gentleman
and
intimate
acquaintance
diligently
after
my
friend
benvenuto
i
want
to
help
and
defend
him
and
whoso
acts
against
thyself
acts
against
the
milanese
nobleman
went
back
much
disconcerted
while
the
bishop
of
frulli
come
to
visit
me
at
cardinal
palace
presenting
himself
to
the
cardinal
he
related
how
cardinal
medici
had
sent
for
benvenuto
and
wanted
to
be
his
protector
now
cardinal
cornaro
who
had
the
touchy
temper
of
a
bear
flew
into
a
rage
and
told
the
bishop
he
was
quite
as
well
able
to
defend
me
as
cardinal
medici
the
bishop
in
reply
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
speak
with
me
on
some
matters
of
his
patron
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
cornaro
bade
him
for
that
day
make
as
though
he
had
already
talked
with
me
cardinal
medici
was
very
angry
however
i
went
the
following
night
without
knowledge
and
under
good
escort
to
pay
him
my
respects
then
i
begged
him
to
grant
me
the
favour
of
leaving
me
where
i
was
and
told
him
of
the
great
courtesy
which
cornaro
had
shown
me
adding
that
if
his
most
reverend
lordship
suffered
me
to
stay
i
should
gain
one
friend
the
more
in
my
hour
of
need
otherwise
his
lordship
might
dispose
of
me
exactly
as
he
thought
best
he
told
me
to
do
as
i
liked
so
i
returned
to
palace
and
a
few
days
afterwards
the
cardinal
farnese
was
elected
pope
after
he
had
put
affairs
of
greater
consequence
in
order
the
new
pope
sent
for
me
saying
that
he
did
not
wish
any
one
else
to
strike
his
coins
to
these
words
of
his
holiness
a
gentleman
very
privately
acquainted
with
him
named
messer
latino
juvinale
made
answer
that
i
was
in
hiding
for
a
murder
committed
on
the
person
of
one
pompeo
of
milan
and
set
forth
what
could
be
argued
for
my
justification
in
the
most
favourable
terms
the
pope
replied
knew
nothing
of
death
but
plenty
of
provocation
so
let
a
be
at
once
made
out
for
him
in
order
that
he
may
be
placed
in
perfect

great
friend
of
who
was
also
intimate

the
pope

to
be
there
he
was
a
milanese
called
messer
ambrogio
this
man
said
the
first
days
of
your
papacy
it
were
not
well
to
of
this
the
pope
turned
to
him
and
answered
know
less
about
such
matters
than
i
do
know
then
that
men
like
benvenuto
unique
in
their
profession
stand
above
the
law
and
how
far
more
he
then
who
received
the
provocation
i
have
heard
of
when
my
safe
conduct
had
been
drawn
out
i
began
at
once
to
serve
him
and
was
treated
with
the
utmost
favour

the

messer
latino
juvinale
came
to
call
on
me
and
gave
me
orders
to
strike
the
coins
of
the
pope
this
roused
up
all
my
enemies
who
began
to
look
about
how
they
should
hinder
me
but
the
pope
perceiving
their
drift
scolded
them
and
insisted
that
i
should
go
on
working
i
took
the
dies
in
hand
designing
a
paul
surrounded
with
this
inscription

this
piece
of
money
gave
far
more
satisfaction
than
the
models
of
my
competitors
so
that
the
pope
forbade
any
one
else
to
speak
to
him
of
coins
since
he
wished
me
only
to
have
to
do
with
them
this
encouraged
me
to
apply
myself
with
untroubled
spirit
to
the
task
and
messer
latino
juvinale
who
had
received
such
orders
from
the
pope
used
to
introduce
me
to
his
holiness
i
had
it
much
at
heart
to
recover
the
post
of
stamper
to
the
mint
but
on
this
point
the
pope
took
advice
and
then
told
me
i
must
first
obtain
pardon
for
the
homicide
and
this
i
should
get
at
the
holy
day
in
august
through
the
caporioni
of
rome
i
may
say
that
it
is
usual
every
year
on
this
solemn
festival
to
grant
the
freedom
of
twelve
outlaws
to
these
officers
meanwhile
he
promised
to
give
me
another
which
should
keep
me
in
security
until
that
time
when
my
enemies
perceived
that
they
were
quite
unable
to
devise
the
means
of
keeping
me
out
of
the
mint
they
resorted
to
another
expedient
the
deceased
pompeo
had
left
three
thousand
ducats
as
dowry
to
an
illegitimate
daughter
of
his
and
they
contrived
that
a
certain
favourite
of
signor
pier
luigi
the
son
should
ask
her
hand
in
marriage
through
the
medium
of
his
master
accordingly
the
match
came
off
but
this
fellow
was
an
insignificant
country
lad
who
had
been
brought
up
by
his
lordship
and
as
folk
said
he
got
but
little
of
the
money
since
his
lordship
laid
his
hands
on
it
and
had
the
mind
to
use
it
now
the
husband
of
the
girl
to
please
his
wife
begged
the
prince
to
have
me
taken
up
and
he
promised
to
do
so
when
the
first
flush
of
my
favour
with
the
pope
had
passed
away
things
stood
so
about
two
months
the
servant
always
suing
for
his
dower
the
master
putting
him
off
with
pretexts
but
assuring
the
woman
that
he
would
certainly
revenge
her
murder
i
obtained
an
inkling
of
these
designs
yet
i
did
not
omit
to
present
myself
pretty
frequently
to
his
lordship
who
made
show
of
treating
me
with
great
distinction
he
had
however
decided
to
do
one
or
other
of
two
to
have
me
assassinated
or
to
have
me
taken
up
by
the
bargello
accordingly
he
commissioned
a
certain
little
devil
of
a
corsican
soldier
in
his
service
to
do
the
trick
as
cleverly
as
he
could
and
my
other
enemies
with
messer
traiano
at
the
head
of
them
promised
the
fellow
a
reward
of
one
hundred
crowns
he
assured
them
that
the
job
would
be
as
easy
as
sucking
a
fresh
egg
seeing
into
their
plot
i
went
about
with
my
eyes
open
and
with
good
attendance
wearing
an
and
armlets
of
mail
for
which
i
had
obtained
permission
the
corsican
influenced
by
avarice
hoped
to
gain
the
whole
sum
of
money
without
risk
and
imagined
himself
capable
of
carrying
the
matter
through
alone
consequently
one
day
after
dinner
he
had
me
sent
for
in
the
name
of
signor
pier
luigi
i
went
off
at
once
because
his
lordship
had
spoken
of
wanting
to
order
several
big
silver
vases
leaving
my
home
in
a
hurry
armed
however
as
usual
i
walked
rapidly
through
strada
giulia
toward
the
palazzo
farnese
not
expecting
to
meet
anybody
at
that
hour
of
day
i
had
reached
the
end
of
the
street
and
was
making
toward
the
palace
when
my
habit
being
always
to
turn
the
corners
wide
i
observed
the
corsican
get
up
and
take
his
station
in
the
middle
of
the
road
being
prepared
i
was
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
but
kept
upon
my
guard
and
slackening
pace
a
little
drew
nearer
toward
the
wall
in
order
to
give
the
fellow
a
wide
berth
he
on
his
side
came
closer
to
the
wall
and
when
we
were
now
within
a
short
distance
of
each
other
i
perceived
by
his
gestures
that
he
had
it
in
his
mind
to
do
me
mischief
and
seeing
me
alone
thus
thought
he
should
succeed
accordingly
i
began
to
speak
and
said
soldier
if
it
had
been
night
you
might
have
said
you
had
mistaken
me
but
since
it
is
full
day
you
know
well
enough
who
i
am
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
you
and
never
injured
you
but
should
be
well
disposed
to
do
you
he
replied
in
a
way
without
however
making
room
for
me
to
pass
that
he
did
not
know
what
i
was
saying
then
i
answered
know
very
well
indeed
what
you
want
and
what
you
are
saying
but
the
job
which
you
have
taken
in
hand
is
more
dangerous
and
difficult
than
you
imagine
and
may
peradventure
turn
out
the
wrong
way
for
you
remember
that
you
have
to
do
with
a
man
who
would
defend
himself
against
a
hundred
and
the
adventure
you
are
on
is
not
esteemed
by
men
of
courage
like
meanwhile
i
also
was
looking
black
as
thunder
and
each
of
us
had
changed
colour
folk
too
gathered
round
us
for
it
had
become
clear
that
our
words
meant
swords
and
daggers
he
then
not
having
the
spirit
to
lay
hands
on
me
cried
out
shall
meet
another
i
answered
am
always
glad
to
meet
honest
men
and
those
who
show
themselves
as
when
we
parted
i
went
to
his
palace
and
found
he
had
not
sent
for
me
when
i
returned
to
my
shop
the
corsican
informed
me
through
an
intimate
friend
of
his
and
mine
that
i
need
not
be
on
my
guard
against
him
since
he
wished
to
be
my
good
brother
but
that
i
ought
to
be
much
upon
my
guard
against
others
seeing
i
was
in
the
greatest
peril
for
folk
of
much
consequence
had
sworn
to
have
my
life
i
sent
to
thank
him
and
kept
the
best
i
could
not
many
days
after
a
friend
of
mine
informed
me
that
signor
pier
luigi
had
given
strict
orders
that
i
should
be
taken
that
very
evening
they
told
me
this
at
twenty
whereupon
i
spoke
with
some
of
my
friends
who
advised
me
to
be
off
at
once
the
order
had
been
given
for
one
hour
after
sunset
accordingly
at
i
left
in
the
post
for
florence
it
seems
that
when
the
corsican
showed
that
he
had
not
pluck
enough
to
do
the
business
as
he
promised
signor
pier
luigi
on
his
own
authority
gave
orders
to
have
me
taken
merely
to
stop
the
mouth
of
daughter
who
was
always
clamouring
to
know
where
her
dower
had
gone
to
when
he
was
unable
to
gratify
her
in
this
matter
of
revenge
on
either
of
the
two
plans
he
had
formed
he
bethought
him
of
another
which
shall
be
related
in
its
proper
place
note
sante
marie
so
the
feast
of
the
assumption
is
called
at
florence
because
devotion
is
paid
on
that
day
to
the
various
images
of
the
virgin
scattered
through
the
town

of

like

and
piacenza
in
he
was
murdered
at

by
his
own
courtiers
in
he
was
a
man
of
infamous
habits
quite
unfit
for
the
high
dignities
conferred
on
him
note

i
reached
florence
in
due
course
and
paid
my
respects
to
the
duke
alessandro
who
greeted
me
with
extraordinary
kindness
and
pressed
me
to
remain
in
his
service
there
was
then
at
florence
a
sculptor
called
il
tribolino
and
we
were
gossips
for
i
had
stood
godfather
to
his
son
in
course
of
conversation
he
told
me
that
a
certain
giacopo
del
sansovino
his
first
master
had
sent
for
him
and
whereas
he
had
never
seen
venice
and
because
of
the
gains
he
expected
he
was
very
glad
to
go
there
on
his
asking
me
if
i
had
ever
been
at
venice
i
said
no
this
made
him
invite
me
to
accompany
him
and
i
agreed
so
then
i
told
duke
alessandro
that
i
wanted
first
to
go
to
venice
and
that
afterwards
i
would
return
to
serve
him
he
exacted
a
formal
promise
to
this
effect
and
bade
me
present
myself
before
i
left
the
city
next
day
having
made
my
preparations
i
went
to
take
leave
of
the
duke
whom
i
found
in
the
palace
of
the
pazzi
at
that
time
inhabited
by
the
wife
and
daughters
of
signor
lorenzo
cibo
having
sent
word
to
his
excellency
that
i
wished
to
set
off
for
venice
with
his
good
leave
signor
cosimino
medici
now
duke
of
florence
returned
with
the
answer
that
i
must
go
to
niccolň
de
monte
aguto
who
would
give
me
fifty
golden
crowns
which
his
excellency
bestowed
on
me
in
sign
of
his
and
afterwards
i
must
return
to
serve
him
i
got
the
money
from
niccolň
and
then
went
to
fetch
tribolo
whom
i
found
ready
to
start
and
he
asked
me
whether
i
had
bound
my
sword
i
answered
that
a
man
on
horseback
about
to
take
a
journey
ought
not
to
bind
his
sword
he
said
that
the
custom
was
so
in
florence
since
a
certain
ser
maurizio
then
held
office
who
was
capable
of
putting
john
the
baptist
to
the
rack
for
any
trifling
peccadillo
accordingly
one
had
to
carry
sword
bound
till
the
gates
were
passed
i
laughed
at
this
and
so
we
set
off
joining
the
courier
to
venice
who
was
nicknamed
il
lamentone
in
his
company
we
travelled
through
bologna
and
arrived
one
evening
at
ferrara
there
we
halted
at
the
inn
of
the
piazza
which
lamentone
went
in
search
of
some
florentine
exiles
to
take
them
letters
and
messages
from
their
wives
the
duke
had
given
orders
that
only
the
courier
might
talk
to
them
and
no
one
else
under
penalty
of
incurring
the
same
banishment
as
they
had
meanwhile
since
it
was
a
little
past
the
hour
of
tribolo
and
i
went
to
see
the
duke
of
ferrara
come
back
from
belfiore
where
he
had
been
at
a
jousting
match
there
we
met
a
number
of
exiles
who
stared
at
us
as
though
they
wished
to
make
us
speak
with
them
tribolo
who
was
the
most
timorous
man
that
i
have
ever
known
kept
on
saying
not
look
at
them
or
talk
to
them
if
you
care
to
go
back
to
so
we
stayed
and
saw
the
duke
return
afterwards
when
we
regained
our
inn
we
found
lamentone
there
after
nightfall
there
appeared
niccolň
benintendi
and
his
brother
piero
and
another
old
man
whom
i
believe
to
have
been
jacopo
nardi
together
with
some
young
fellows
who
began
immediately
to
ask
the
courier
news
each
man
of
his
own
family
in
florence
tribolo
and
i
kept
at
a
distance
in
order
to
avoid
speaking
with
them
after
they
had
talked
a
while
with
lamentone
niccolň
benintendi
said
know
those
two
men
there
very
well
the
reason
they
give
themselves
such
beastly
airs
and
will
not
talk
to
us
tribolo
kept
begging
me
to
hold
my
tongue
while
lamentone
told
them
that
we
had
not
the
same
permission
as
he
had
benintendi
retorted
it
was
idiotic
nonsense
adding
take
them
and
other
pretty
flowers
of
speech
then
i
raised
my
head
as
gently
as
i
could
and
said
gentlemen
you
are
able
to
do
us
serious
injury
while
we
can
not
render
you
any
assistance
and
though
you
have
flung
words
at
us
which
we
are
far
from
deserving
we
do
not
mean
on
that
account
to
get
into
a
rage
with
thereupon
old
nardi
said
that
i
had
spoken
like
a
worthy
young
man
as
i
was
but
niccolň
benintendi
shouted
snap
my
fingers
at
them
and
the
i
replied
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
toward
us
since
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
or
his
affairs
old
nardi
took
our
part
telling
benintendi
plainly
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
which
made
him
go
on
muttering
insults
on
this
i
bade
him
know
that
i
could
say
and
do
things
to
him
which
he
would
not
like
and
therefore
he
had
better
mind
his
business
and
let
us
alone
once
more
he
cried
out
that
he
snapped
his
fingers
at
the
duke
and
us
and
that
we
were
all
of
us
a
heap
of
donkeys
i
replied
by
giving
him
the
lie
direct
and
drawing
my
sword
the
old
man
wanting
to
be
first
upon
the
staircase
tumbled
down
some
steps
and
all
the
rest
of
them
came
huddling
after
him
i
rushed
onward
brandishing
my
sword
along
the
walls
with
fury
and
shouting
will
kill
you
all
but
i
took
good
care
not
to
do
them
any
harm
as
i
might
too
easily
have
done
in
the
midst
of
this
tumult
the
innkeeper
screamed
out
lamentone
cried
sake
hold
some
of
them
exclaimed
me
my
head
others
me
get
out
from
in
short
it
was
an
indescribable
confusion
they
looked
like
a
herd
of
swine
then
the
host
came
with
a
light
while
i
withdrew
upstairs
and
put
my
sword
back
in
its
scabbard
lamentone
told
niccolň
benintendi
that
he
had
behaved
very
ill
the
host
said
to
him
is
as
much
as
life
is
worth
to
draw
swords
here
and
if
the
duke
were
to
know
of
your
brawling
he
would
have
you
hanged
i
will
not
do
to
you
what
you
deserve
but
take
care
you
never
show
yourself
again
in
my
inn
or
it
will
be
the

after
we
had
supped
a
appeared
and
offered
to
take
us
to

i
asked
if
he
would
let
us
have
the
boat
to
ourselves
he
was
willing
and
so
we
made
our
bargain
in
the
morning
we
rose
early
and
mounted
our
horses
for
the
port
which
is
a
few
miles
distant
from
ferrara
on
arriving
there
we
found
niccolň
brother
with
three
comrades
waiting
for
me
they
had
among
them
two
lances
and
i
had
bought
a
stout
pike
in
ferrara
being
very
well
armed
to
boot
i
was
not
at
all
frightened
as
tribolo
was
who
cried
help
us
those
fellows
are
waiting
here
to
murder
lamentone
turned
to
me
and
said
best
that
you
can
do
is
to
go
back
to
ferrara
for
i
see
that
the
affair
is
likely
to
be
ugly
for
sake
benvenuto
do
not
risk
the
fury
of
these
mad
to
which
i
replied
us
go
forward
for
god
helps
those
who
have
the
right
on
their
side
and
you
shall
see
how
i
will
help
myself
is
not
this
boat
engaged
for
us
said
lamentone
we
will
stay
in
it
without
them
unless
my
manhood
has
deserted
i
put
spurs
to
my
horse
and
when
i
was
within
fifty
paces
dismounted
and
marched
boldly
forward
with
my
pike
tribolo
stopped
behind
all
huddled
up
upon
his
horse
looking
the
very
image
of
frost
lamentone
the
courier
meanwhile
was
swelling
and
snorting
like
the
wind
that
was
his
usual
habit
but
now
he
did
so
more
than
he
was
wont
being
in
doubt
how
this
devilish
affair
would
terminate
when
i
reached
the
boat
the
master
presented
himself
and
said
that
those
florentine
gentlemen
wanted
to
embark
in
it
with
us
if
i
was
willing
i
answered
boat
is
engaged
for
us
and
no
one
else
and
it
grieves
me
to
the
heart
that
i
am
not
able
to
have
their
at
these
words
a
brave
young
man
of
the
magalotti
family
spoke
out
we
will
make
you
able
to
have
to
which
i
answered
god
and
my
good
cause
together
with
my
own
strength
of
body
and
mind
possess
the
will
and
the
power
you
shall
not
make
me
able
to
have
what
you
so
saying
i
leapt
into
the
boat
and
turning
my
point
against
them
added
show
you
with
this
weapon
that
i
am
not
wishing
to
prove
he
was
in
earnest
magalotti
then
seized
his
own
and
came
toward
me
i
sprang
upon
the
gunwale
and
hit
him
such
a
blow
that
if
he
had
not
tumbled
backward
i
must
have
pierced
his
body
his
comrades
in
lieu
of
helping
him
turned
to
fly
and
when
i
saw
that
i
could
kill
him
instead
of
striking
i
said
up
brother
take
your
arms
and
go
away
i
have
shown
you
that
i
can
not
do
what
i
do
not
want
and
what
i
had
the
power
to
do
i
have
not
chosen
to
then
i
called
for
tribolo
the
boatman
and
lamentone
to
embark
and
so
we
got
under
way
for
venice
when
we
had
gone
ten
miles
on
the
po
we
sighted
those
young
men
who
had
got
into
a
skiff
and
caught
us
up
and
when
they
were
alongside
that
idiot
piero
benintendi
sang
out
to
me
thy
ways
this
time
benvenuto
we
shall
meet
in
out
betimes
then
i
shouted
i
am
coming
and
any
man
can
meet
me
where
he
in
due
course
we
arrived
at
venice
when
i
applied
to
a
brother
of
cardinal
cornaro
begging
him
to
procure
for
me
the
favour
of
being
allowed
to
carry
arms
he
advised
me
to
do
so
without
hesitation
saying
that
the
worst
risk
i
ran
was
that
i
might
lose
my
sword
lxxviii
accordingly
i
girded
on
my
sword
and
went
to
visit
jacopo
del
sansovino
the
sculptor
who
had
sent
for
tribolo
he
received
me
most
kindly
and
invited
us
to
dinner
and
we
stayed
with
him
in
course
of
conversation
with
tribolo
he
told
him
that
he
had
no
work
to
give
him
at
the
moment
but
that
he
might
call
again
hearing
this
i
burst
out
laughing
and
said
pleasantly
to
sansovino
house
is
too
far
off
from
his
if
he
must
call
poor
tribolo
all
in
dismay
exclaimed
have
got
your
letter
here
which
you
wrote
to
bid
me
sansovino
rejoined
that
men
of
his
sort
men
of
worth
and
genius
were
free
to
do
that
and
greater
things
besides
tribolo
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
and
muttered
patience
several
times
thereupon
without
regarding
the
copious
dinner
which
sansovino
had
given
me
i
took
the
part
of
my
comrade
tribolo
for
he
was
in
the
right
all
the
while
at
table
sansovino
had
never
stopped
chattering
about
his
great
achievements
abusing
michel
agnolo
and
the
rest
of
his
while
he
bragged
and
vaunted
himself
to
the
skies
this
had
so
annoyed
me
that
not
a
single
mouthful
which
i
ate
had
tasted
well
but
i
refrained
from
saying
more
than
these
two
words
jacopo
men
of
worth
act
like
men
of
worth
and
men
of
genius
who
produce
things
beautiful
and
excellent
shine
forth
far
better
when
other
people
praise
them
than
when
they
boast
so
confidently
of
their
own
upon
this
he
and
i
rose
from
table
blowing
off
the
steam
of
our
choler
the
same
day
happening
to
pass
near
the
rialto
i
met
piero
benintendi
in
the
company
of
some
men
and
perceiving
that
they
were
going
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
i
turned
into
an
shop
till
the
storm
blew
over
afterwards
i
learned
that
the
young
magalotti
to
whom
i
showed
that
courtesy
had
scolded
them
roundly
and
thus
the
affair
ended
lxxix
a
few
days
afterwards
we
set
out
on
our
return
to
florence
we
lay
one
night
at
a
place
on
this
side
chioggia
on
the
left
hand
as
you
go
toward
ferrara
here
the
host
insisted
upon
being
paid
before
we
went
to
bed
and
in
his
own
way
and
when
i
observed
that
it
was
the
custom
everywhere
else
to
pay
in
the
morning
he
answered
insist
on
being
paid
overnight
and
in
my
own
i
retorted
that
men
who
wanted
everything
their
own
way
ought
to
make
a
world
after
their
own
fashion
since
things
were
differently
managed
here
our
host
told
me
not
to
go
on
bothering
his
brains
because
he
was
determined
to
do
as
he
had
said
tribolo
stood
trembling
with
fear
and
nudged
me
to
keep
quiet
lest
they
should
do
something
worse
to
us
so
we
paid
them
in
the
way
they
wanted
and
afterwards
we
retired
to
rest
we
had
i
must
admit
the
most
capital
beds
new
in
every
particular
and
as
clean
as
they
could
be
nevertheless
i
did
not
get
one
wink
of
sleep
because
i
kept
on
thinking
how
i
could
revenge
myself
at
one
time
it
came
into
my
head
to
set
fire
to
his
house
at
another
to
cut
the
throats
of
four
fine
horses
which
he
had
in
the
stable
i
saw
well
enough
that
it
was
easy
for
me
to
do
all
this
but
i
could
not
see
how
it
was
easy
to
secure
myself
and
my
companion
at
last
i
resolved
to
put
my
things
and
my
on
board
the
boat
and
so
i
did
when
the
had
been
harnessed
to
the
cable
i
ordered
the
people
not
to
stir
before
i
returned
for
i
had
left
a
pair
of
slippers
in
my
bedroom
accordingly
i
went
back
to
the
inn
and
called
our
host
who
told
me
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
us
and
that
we
might
go
to
jericho
there
was
a
ragged
about
half
a
sleep
who
cried
out
to
me
master
would
not
move
to
please
the
pope
because
he
has
got
a
wench
in
bed
with
him
whom
he
has
been
wanting
this
long
then
he
asked
me
for
a
tip
and
i
gave
him
a
few
venetian
coppers
and
told
him
to
make
the
wait
till
i
had
found
my
slippers
and
returned
i
went
upstairs
took
out
a
little
knife
as
sharp
as
a
razor
and
cut
the
four
beds
that
i
found
there
into
ribbons
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
i
had
done
a
damage
of
more
than
fifty
crowns
then
i
ran
down
to
the
boat
with
some
pieces
of
the
in
my
pouch
and
bade
the
bargee
start
at
once
without
delay
we
had
not
gone
far
before
my
gossip
tribolo
said
that
he
had
left
behind
some
little
straps
belonging
to
his
and
that
he
must
be
allowed
to
go
back
for
them
i
answered
that
he
need
not
take
thought
for
a
pair
of
little
straps
since
i
could
make
him
as
many
big
ones
as
he
liked
he
told
me
i
was
always
joking
but
that
he
must
really
go
back
for
his
straps
then
he
began
ordering
the
bargee
to
stop
while
i
kept
ordering
him
to
go
on
meanwhile
i
informed
my
friend
what
kind
of
trick
i
had
played
our
host
and
showed
him
specimens
of
the
and
other
things
which
threw
him
into
such
a
quaking
fright
that
he
roared
out
to
the
bargee
with
you
on
with
you
as
quick
as
you
can
and
never
thought
himself
quite
safe
until
we
reached
the
gates
of
florence
when
we
arrived
there
tribolo
said
us
bind
our
swords
up
for
the
love
of
god
and
play
me
no
more
of
your
games
i
beg
for
all
this
while
felt
as
though
my
guts
were
in
the
i
made
answer
tribolo
you
need
not
tie
your
sword
up
for
you
have
never
loosed
it
and
this
i
said
at
random
because
i
never
once
had
seen
him
act
the
man
upon
that
journey
when
he
heard
the
remark
he
looked
at
his
sword
and
cried
out
name
you
speak
true
here
it
is
tied
just
as
i
arranged
it
before
i
left
my
my
gossip
deemed
that
i
had
been
a
bad
travelling
companion
to
him
because
i
resented
affronts
and
defended
myself
against
folk
who
would
have
done
us
injury
but
i
deemed
that
he
had
acted
a
far
worse
part
with
regard
to
me
by
never
coming
to
my
assistance
at
such
pinches
let
him
judge
between
us
who
stands
by
and
has
no
personal
interest
in
our
adventures

no
sooner
had
i
dismounted
that
i
went
to
visit
duke
alessandro
and
thanked
him
greatly
for
his
present
of
the
fifty
crowns
telling
his
excellency
that
i
was
always
ready
to
serve
him
according
to
my
abilities
he
gave
me
orders
at
once
to
strike
dies
for
his
coinage
and
the
first
i
made
was
a
piece
of
forty
soldi
with
the
head
on
one
side
and
san
cosimo
and
san
damiano
on
the
other
this
was
in
silver
and
it
gave
so
much
satisfaction
that
the
duke
did
not
hesitate
to
say
they
were
the
best
pieces
of
money
in
christendom
the
same
said
all
florence
and
every
one
who
saw
them
consequently
i
asked
his
excellency
to
make
me
appointments
and
to
grant
me
the
lodgings
of
the
mint
he
bade
me
remain
in
his
service
and
promised
he
would
give
me
more
than
i
demanded
meanwhile
he
said
he
had
commissioned
the
master
of
the
mint
a
certain
carlo
acciaiuoli
and
that
i
might
go
to
him
for
all
the
money
that
i
wanted
this
i
found
to
be
true
but
i
drew
my
monies
so
discreetly
that
i
had
always
something
to
my
credit
according
to
my
account
i
then
made
dies
for
a
giulio
it
had
san
giovanni
in
profile
seated
with
a
book
in
his
hand
finer
in
my
judgment
than
anything
which
i
had
done
and
on
the
other
side
were
the
armorial
bearings
of
duke
alessandro
next
i
made
dies
for
on
which
i
struck
the
full
face
of
san
giovanni
in
small
this
was
the
first
coin
with
a
head
in
full
face
on
so
thin
a
piece
of
silver
that
had
yet
been
seen
the
difficulty
of
executing
it
is
apparent
only
to
the
eyes
of
such
as
are
in
these
crafts
afterwards
i
made
dies
for
the
golden
crowns
this
crown
had
a
cross
upon
one
side
with
some
little
cherubim
and
on
the
other
side
his
arms
when
i
had
struck
these
four
sorts
i
begged
the
duke
to
make
out
my
appointments
and
to
assign
me
the
lodgings
i
have
mentioned
if
he
was
contented
with
my
service
he
told
me
very
graciously
that
he
was
quite
satisfied
and
that
he
would
grant
me
my
request
while
we
were
thus
talking
his
excellency
was
in
his
wardrobe
looking
at
a
remarkable
little
gun
that
had
been
sent
him
out
of
germany
when
he
noticed
that
i
too
paid
particular
attention
to
this
pretty
instrument
he
put
it
in
my
hands
saying
that
he
knew
how
much
pleasure
i
took
in
such
things
and
adding
that
i
might
choose
for
earnest
of
his
promises
an
arquebuse
to
my
own
liking
from
the
armoury
excepting
only
this
one
piece
he
was
well
aware
that
i
should
find
things
of
greater
beauty
and
not
less
excellent
there
upon
this
invitation
i
accepted
with
thanks
and
when
he
saw
me
looking
round
he
ordered
his
master
of
the
wardrobe
a
certain
pretino
of
lucca
to
let
me
take
whatever
i
liked
then
he
went
away
with
the
most
pleasant
words
at
parting
while
i
remained
and
chose
the
finest
and
best
arquebuse
i
ever
saw
or
ever
had
and
took
it
back
with
me
to
home
two
days
afterward
i
brought
some
drawings
which
his
excellency
had
commissioned
for
he
wanted
to
give
his
wife
who
was
at
that
time
still
in
naples
i
again
asked
him
to
settle
my
affairs
then
his
excellency
told
me
that
he
should
like
me
first
to
execute
the
die
of
his
portrait
in
fine
style
as
i
had
done
for
pope
clement
i
began
it
in
wax
and
the
duke
gave
orders
while
i
was
at
work
upon
it
that
whenever
i
went
to
take
his
portrait
i
should
be
admitted
perceiving
that
i
had
a
lengthy
piece
of
business
on
my
hands
i
sent
for
a
certain
pietro
pagolo
from
monte
ritondo
in
the
roman
district
who
had
been
with
me
from
his
boyhood
in
rome
i
found
him
with
one
bernardonaccio
a
goldsmith
who
did
not
treat
him
well
so
i
brought
him
away
from
there
and
taught
him
minutely
how
to
strike
coins
from
those
dies
meanwhile
i
went
on
making
the
portrait
and
oftentimes
i
found
him
napping
after
dinner
with
that
lorenzino
of
his
who
afterwards
murdered
him
and
no
other
company
and
much
i
marvelled
that
a
duke
of
that
sort
showed
such
confidence
about
his
safety

were

complained
of
this
to
the

who
when
he
saw
how
the
matter
stood
took
it
very
ill
and
said
to
me
tell
this
to
ottaviano
medici
and
show
him
how
it
i
lost
no
time
and
when
i
had
pointed
out
the
injury
that
had
been
done
to
my
fine
coins
he
answered
like
the
donkey
that
he
was
choose
to
have
it
i
replied
that
it
ought
not
to
be
so
and
that
i
did
not
choose
to
have
it
so
he
said
if
the
duke
likes
to
have
it
so
i
answered
would
not
suit
me
for
the
thing
is
neither
just
nor
he
told
me
to
take
myself
off
and
that
i
should
have
no
swallow
it
in
this
way
even
if
i
burst
then
i
returned
to
the
duke
and
related
the
whole
unpleasant
conversation
between
ottaviano
medici
and
me
entreating
his
excellency
not
to
allow
the
fine
coins
which
i
had
made
for
him
to
be
spoiled
and
begging
for
permission
to
leave
florence
he
replied
is
too
presuming
you
shall
have
what
you
want
for
this
is
an
injury
offered
to
that
very
day
which
was
a
thursday
i
received
from
rome
a
full
from
the
pope
with
advice
to
go
there
at
once
and
get
the
pardon
of
our
feast
in
in
order
that
i
might
clear
myself
from
the
penalties
attaching
to
my
homicide
i
went
to
the
duke
whom
i
found
in
bed
for
they
told
me
he
was
suffering
the
consequence
of
a
debauch
in
little
more
than
two
hours
i
finished
what
was
wanted
for
his
waxen
medal
and
when
i
showed
it
to
him
it
pleased
him
extremely
then
i
exhibited
the
sent
me
at
the
order
of
the
pope
and
told
him
how
his
holiness
had
recalled
me
to
execute
certain
pieces
of
work
on
this
account
i
should
like
to
regain
my
footing
in
the
fair
city
of
rome
which
would
not
prevent
my
attending
to
his
medal
the
duke
made
answer
half
in
anger
do
as
i
desire
stay
here
i
will
provide
for
your
appointments
and
will
give
you
the
lodgings
in
the
mint
with
much
more
than
you
could
ask
for
because
your
requests
are
only
just
and
reasonable
and
who
do
you
think
will
be
able
to
strike
the
beautiful
dies
which
you
have
made
for
me
then
i
said
lord
i
have
thought
of
everything
for
i
have
here
a
pupil
of
mine
a
young
roman
whom
i
have
taught
the
art
he
will
serve
your
excellency
very
well
till
i
return
with
your
medal
finished
to
remain
for
ever
in
your
service
i
have
in
rome
a
shop
open
with
journeymen
and
a
pretty
business
as
soon
as
i
have
got
my
pardon
i
will
leave
all
the
devotion
of
rome
to
a
pupil
of
mine
there
and
will
come
back
with
your
good
permission
to
during
this
conversation
the
lorenzino
medici
whom
i
have
above
mentioned
was
present
and
no
one
else
the
duke
frequently
signed
to
him
that
he
should
join
in
pressing
me
to
stay
but
lorenzino
never
said
anything
except
you
would
do
better
to
remain
where
you
i
answered
that
i
wanted
by
all
means
to
regain
my
hold
on
rome
he
made
no
reply
but
continued
eyeing
the
duke
with
very
evil
glances
when
i
had
finished
the
medal
to
my
liking
and
shut
it
in
its
little
box
i
said
to
the
duke
lord
pray
let
me
have
your
for
i
will
make
you
a
much
finer
medal
than
the
one
i
made
for
pope
clement
it
is
only
reasonable
that
i
should
since
that
was
the
first
i
ever
made
messer
lorenzo
here
will
give
me
some
exquisite
reverse
as
he
is
a
person
learned
and
of
the
greatest
to
these
words
lorenzo
suddenly
made
answer
have
been
thinking
of
nothing
else
but
how
to
give
you
a
reverse
worthy
of
his
the
duke
laughed
a
little
and
looking
at
lorenzo
said
you
shall
give
him
the
reverse
and
he
shall
do
it
here
and
shall
not
go
lorenzo
took
him
up
at
once
saying
will
do
it
as
quickly
as
i
can
and
i
hope
to
do
something
that
shall
make
the
whole
world
the
duke
who
held
him
sometimes
for
a
fool
and
sometimes
for
a
coward
turned
about
in
bed
and
laughed
at
his
bragging
words
i
took
my
leave
without
further
ceremony
and
left
them
alone
together
the
duke
who
did
not
believe
that
i
was
really
going
said
nothing
further
afterwards
when
he
knew
that
i
was
gone
he
sent
one
of
his
servants
who
caught
me
up
at
siena
and
gave
me
fifty
golden
ducats
with
a
message
from
the
duke
that
i
should
take
and
use
them
for
his
sake
and
should
return
as
soon
as
possible
from
messer
lorenzo
i
have
to
tell
you
that
he
is
preparing
an
admirable
reverse
for
that
medal
which
you
want
to
i
had
left
full
directions
to
petro
pagolo
the
roman
above
mentioned
how
he
had
to
use
the
dies
but
as
it
was
a
very
delicate
affair
he
never
quite
succeeded
in
employing
them
i
remained
creditor
to
the
mint
in
a
matter
of
more
than
seventy
crowns
on
account
of
dies
supplied
by
me
note
this
ottaviano
was
not
descended
from
either
cosimo
or
lorenzo
medici
but
from
an
elder
though
less
illustrious
branch
of
the
great
family
he
married
francesca
salviati
the
aunt
of
duke
cosimo
though
a
great
patron
of
the
arts
and
an
intimate
friend
of
buonarroti
he
was
not
popular
owing
to
his
pride
of
place
note
cellini
praises
this
man
however
in
the
preface
to
the
note
this
is
perhaps
equivalent
to
note
la
divozione
di
roma
it
is
not
very
clear
what
this
exactly
means
perhaps
the
affection
and
reverence
i
have
for
the
city
of
rome
or
merely
my
ties
in
lxxxii
on
the
journey
to
rome
i
carried
with
me
that
handsome
arquebuse
which
the
duke
gave
me
and
very
much
to
my
own
pleasure
i
used
it
several
times
by
the
way
performing
incredible
feats
by
means
of
it
the
little
house
i
had
in
strada
giulia
was
not
ready
so
i
dismounted
at
the
house
of
messer
giovanni
gaddi
clerk
of
the
camera
to
whose
keeping
i
had
committed
on
leaving
rome
many
of
my
arms
and
other
things
i
cared
for
so
i
did
not
choose
to
alight
at
my
shop
but
sent
for
felice
my
partner
and
got
him
to
put
my
little
dwelling
forthwith
into
excellent
order
the
day
following
i
went
to
sleep
there
after
well
providing
myself
with
clothes
and
all
things
requisite
since
i
intended
to
go
and
thank
the
pope
next
morning
i
had
two
young
and
beneath
my
lodgings
lived
a
laundress
who
cooked
extremely
nicely
for
me
that
evening
i
entertained
several
friends
at
supper
and
having
passed
the
time
with
great
enjoyment
betook
myself
to
bed
the
night
had
hardly
ended
indeed
it
was
more
than
an
hour
before
daybreak
when
i
heard
a
furious
knocking
at
the
stroke
succeeding
stroke
without
a
pause
accordingly
i
called
my
elder
servant
cencio
he
was
the
man
i
took
into
the
necromantic
circle
and
bade
him
to
go
and
see
who
the
madman
was
that
knocked
so
brutally
at
that
hour
of
the
night
while
cencio
was
on
this
errand
i
lighted
another
lamp
for
i
always
keep
one
by
me
at
night
then
i
made
haste
to
pass
an
excellent
coat
of
mail
over
my
shirt
and
above
that
some
clothes
which
i
caught
up
at
random
cencio
returned
exclaiming
master
it
is
the
bargello
and
all
his
guard
and
he
says
that
if
you
do
not
open
at
once
he
will
knock
the
door
down
they
have
torches
and
a
thousand
things
besides
with
them
i
answered
them
that
i
am
huddling
my
clothes
on
and
will
come
out
to
them
in
my
supposing
it
was
a
trap
laid
to
murder
me
as
had
before
been
done
by
signor
pier
luigi
i
seized
an
excellent
dagger
with
my
right
hand
and
with
the
left
i
took
the
then
i
ran
to
the
which
looked
out
on
gardens
and
there
i
saw
more
than
thirty
constables
wherefore
i
knew
that
i
could
not
escape
upon
that
side
i
made
the
two
lads
go
in
front
and
told
them
to
open
the
door
exactly
when
i
gave
the
word
to
do
so
then
taking
up
an
attitude
of
defence
with
the
dagger
in
my
right
hand
and
the
in
my
left
i
cried
to
the
lads
no
fear
but
open
the
bargello
vittorio
and
the
officers
sprang
inside
at
once
thinking
they
could
easily
lay
hands
upon
me
but
when
they
saw
me
prepared
in
that
way
to
receive
them
they
fell
back
exclaiming
have
a
serious
job
on
hand
here
then
i
threw
the
to
them
and
said
that
and
since
you
can
not
seize
me
i
do
not
mean
that
you
shall
touch
the
bargello
upon
this
ordered
some
of
his
men
to
arrest
me
saying
he
would
look
to
the
later
thereat
i
presented
my
arms
boldly
calling
aloud
god
defend
the
right
either
i
shall
escape
your
hands
alive
or
be
taken
a
dead
corpse
the
room
was
crammed
with
men
they
made
as
though
they
would
resort
to
violence
i
stood
upon
my
guard
against
them
so
that
the
bargello
saw
he
would
not
be
able
to
have
me
except
in
the
way
i
said
accordingly
he
called
his
clerk
and
while
the
as
being
read
he
showed
by
signs
two
or
three
times
that
he
meant
to
have
me
secured
by
his
officers
but
this
had
no
effect
of
shaking
my
determination
at
last
they
gave
up
the
attempt
threw
my
on
the
ground
and
went
away
without
their
prize
note
vincenzio
romoli
lxxxiii
when
i
returned
to
bed
i
felt
so
agitated
that
i
could
not
get
to
sleep
again
my
mind
was
made
up
to
let
blood
as
soon
as
day
broke
however
i
asked
advice
of
messer
gaddi
and
he
referred
to
a
wretched
he
employed
who
asked
me
if
i
had
been
frightened
now
just
consider
what
a
judicious
doctor
this
was
after
i
had
narrated
an
occurrence
of
that
gravity
to
ask
me
such
a
question
he
was
an
empty
fribbler
who
kept
perpetually
laughing
about
nothing
at
all
simpering
and
sniggering
then
he
bade
me
drink
a
good
cup
of
greek
wine
keep
my
spirits
up
and
not
be
frightened
messer
giovanni
however
said
a
man
of
bronze
or
marble
might
be
frightened
in
such
circumstances
how
much
more
one
of
flesh
and
blood
the
quack
responded
we
are
not
all
made
after
the
same
pattern
this
fellow
is
no
man
of
bronze
or
marble
but
of
pure
then
he
gave
one
of
his
meaningless
laughs
and
putting
his
fingers
on
my
wrist
said
here
this
is
not
a
pulse
but
a
or
a
at
this
i
whose
blood
was
thumping
in
my
veins
probably
far
beyond
anything
which
that
fool
of
a
doctor
had
learned
from
his
hippocrates
or
galen
knew
at
once
how
serious
was
my
situation
yet
wishing
not
to
add
to
my
uneasiness
and
to
the
harm
i
had
already
taken
i
made
show
of
being
in
good
spirits
while
this
was
happening
messer
giovanni
had
ordered
dinner
and
we
all
of
us
sat
down
to
eat
in
company
i
remembered
that
messer
lodovico
da
fano
messer
antonio
allegretti
messer
giovanni
greco
all
of
them
men
of
the
finest
scholarship
and
messer
annibal
caro
who
was
then
quite
young
were
present
at
table
the
conversation
turned
entirely
upon
my
act
of
daring
they
insisted
on
hearing
the
whole
story
over
and
over
again
from
my
apprentice
cencio
who
was
a
youth
of
superlative
talent
bravery
and
extreme
personal
beauty
each
time
that
he
described
my
truculent
behaviour
throwing
himself
into
the
attitudes
i
had
assumed
and
repeating
the
words
which
i
had
used
he
called
up
some
fresh
detail
to
my
memory
they
kept
asking
him
if
he
had
been
afraid
to
which
he
answered
that
they
ought
to
ask
me
if
i
had
been
afraid
because
he
felt
precisely
the
same
as
i
had
all
this
chattering
grew
irksome
to
me
and
since
i
still
felt
strongly
agitated
i
rose
at
last
from
table
saying
that
i
wanted
to
go
and
get
new
clothes
of
blue
silk
and
stuff
for
him
and
me
adding
that
i
meant
to
walk
in
procession
after
four
days
at
the
feast
of
our
lady
and
meant
cencio
to
carry
a
white
lighted
torch
on
the
occasion
accordingly
i
took
my
leave
and
had
the
blue
cloth
cut
together
with
a
handsome
jacket
of
blue
sarcenet
and
a
little
doublet
of
the
same
and
i
had
a
similar
jacket
and
waistcoat
made
for
cencio
when
these
things
had
been
cut
out
i
went
to
see
the
pope
who
told
me
to
speak
with
messer
ambruogio
for
he
had
given
orders
that
i
should
execute
a
large
piece
of
golden
plate
so
i
went
to
find
messer
ambruogio
who
had
heard
the
whole
of
the
affair
of
the
bargello
and
had
been
in
concert
with
my
enemies
to
bring
me
back
to
rome
and
had
scolded
the
bargello
for
not
laying
hands
on
me
the
man
excused
himself
by
saying
that
he
could
not
do
so
in
the
face
of
the
which
i
held
messer
ambruogio
now
began
to
talk
about
the
commission
and
bade
me
make
drawings
for
it
saying
that
the
business
should
be
put
at
once
in
train
meanwhile
the
feast
of
our
lady
came
round
now
it
is
the
custom
for
those
who
get
a
pardon
upon
this
occasion
to
give
themselves
up
to
prison
in
order
to
avoid
doing
which
i
returned
to
the
pope
and
told
his
holiness
that
i
was
very
unwilling
to
go
to
prison
and
that
i
begged
him
to
grant
me
the
favour
of
a
dispensation
the
pope
answered
that
such
was
the
custom
and
that
i
must
follow
it
thereupon
i
fell
again
upon
my
knees
and
thanked
him
for
the
he
had
given
me
saying
at
the
same
time
that
i
should
go
back
with
it
to
serve
my
duke
in
florence
who
was
waiting
for
me
so
impatiently
on
hearing
this
the
pope
turned
to
one
of
his
confidential
servants
and
said
benvenuto
get
his
grace
without
the
prison
and
see
that
his
proprio
is
made
out
in
due
as
soon
as
the
document
had
been
drawn
up
his
holiness
signed
it
it
was
then
registered
at
the
capitol
afterwards
upon
the
day
appointed
i
walked
in
procession
very
honourably
between
two
gentlemen
and
so
got
clear
at
last
note
possibly
bernardino
lilii
of
todi
lxxxiv
four
days
had
passed
when
i
was
attacked
with
violent
fever
attended
by
extreme
cold
and
taking
to
my
bed
i
made
my
mind
up
that
i
was
sure
to
die
i
had
the
first
doctors
of
rome
called
in
among
whom
was
francesco
da
norcia
a
physician
of
great
age
and
of
the
best
repute
in
rome
i
told
them
what
i
believed
to
be
the
cause
of
my
illness
and
said
that
i
had
wished
to
let
blood
but
that
i
had
been
advised
against
it
and
if
it
was
not
too
late
i
begged
them
to
bleed
me
now
maestro
francesco
answered
that
it
would
not
be
well
for
me
to
let
blood
then
but
that
if
i
had
done
so
before
i
should
have
escaped
without
mischief
at
present
they
would
have
to
treat
the
case
with
other
remedies
so
they
began
to
doctor
me
as
energetically
as
they
were
able
while
i
grew
daily
worse
and
worse
so
rapidly
that
after
eight
days
the
physicians
despaired
of
my
life
and
said
that
i
might
be
indulged
in
any
whim
i
had
to
make
me
comfortable
maestro
francesco
added
long
as
there
is
breath
in
him
call
me
at
all
hours
for
no
one
can
divine
what
nature
is
able
to
work
in
a
young
man
of
this
kind
moreover
if
he
should
lose
consciousness
administer
these
five
remedies
one
after
the
other
and
send
for
me
for
i
will
come
at
any
hour
of
the
night
i
would
rather
save
him
than
any
of
the
cardinals
in
every
day
messer
giovanni
gaddi
came
to
see
me
two
or
three
times
and
each
time
he
took
up
one
or
other
of
my
handsome
coats
of
mail
or
swords
using
words
like
these
is
a
handsome
thing
that
other
is
still
handsomer
and
likewise
with
my
models
and
other
trifles
so
that
at
last
he
drove
me
wild
with
annoyance
in
his
company
came
a
certain
matio
franzesi
and
this
man
also
appeared
to
be
waiting
impatiently
for
my
death
not
indeed
because
he
would
inherit
anything
from
me
but
because
he
wished
for
what
his
master
seemed
to
have
so
much
at
heart
felice
my
partner
was
always
at
my
side
rendering
the
greatest
services
which
it
is
possible
for
one
man
to
give
another
nature
in
me
was
utterly
debilitated
and
undone
i
had
not
strength
enough
to
fetch
my
breath
back
if
it
left
me
and
yet
my
brain
remained
as
clear
and
strong
as
it
had
been
before
my
illness
nevertheless
although
i
kept
my
consciousness
a
terrible
old
man
used
to
come
to
my
bedside
and
make
as
though
he
would
drag
me
by
force
into
a
huge
boat
he
had
with
him
this
made
me
call
out
to
my
felice
to
draw
near
and
chase
that
malignant
old
man
away
felice
who
loved
me
most
affectionately
ran
weeping
and
crying
with
you
old
traitor
you
are
robbing
me
of
all
the
good
i
have
in
this
messer
giovanni
gaddi
who
was
present
then
began
to
say
poor
fellow
is
delirious
and
has
only
a
few
hours
to
his
fellow
mattio
franzesi
remarked
has
read
dante
and
in
the
prostration
of
his
sickness
this
apparition
has
appeared
to
then
he
added
laughingly
with
you
old
rascal
and
bother
our
friend
when
i
saw
that
they
were
making
fun
of
me
i
turned
to
messer
gaddi
and
said
dear
master
know
that
i
am
not
raving
and
that
it
is
true
that
this
old
man
is
really
giving
me
annoyance
but
the
best
that
you
can
do
for
me
would
be
to
drive
that
miserable
mattio
from
my
side
who
is
laughing
at
my
affliction
afterwards
if
your
lordship
deigns
to
visit
me
again
let
me
beg
you
to
come
with
messer
antonio
allegretti
or
with
messer
annibal
caro
or
with
some
other
of
your
accomplished
friends
who
are
persons
of
quite
different
intelligence
and
discretion
from
that
thereupon
messer
giovanni
told
mattio
in
jest
to
take
himself
out
of
his
sight
for
ever
but
because
mattio
went
on
laughing
the
joke
turned
to
earnest
for
messer
giovanni
would
not
look
upon
him
again
but
sent
for
messer
antonio
allegretti
messer
ludovico
and
messer
annibal
caro
on
the
arrival
of
these
worthy
men
i
was
greatly
comforted
and
talked
reasonably
with
them
awhile
not
however
without
frequently
urging
felice
to
drive
the
old
man
away
messer
ludovico
asked
me
what
it
was
i
seemed
to
see
and
how
the
man
was
shaped
while
i
portrayed
him
accurately
in
words
the
old
man
took
me
by
the
arm
and
dragged
me
violently
towards
him
this
made
me
cry
out
for
aid
because
he
was
going
to
fling
me
under
hatches
in
his
hideous
boat
on
saying
that
last
word
i
fell
into
a
terrible
swoon
and
seemed
to
be
sinking
down
into
the
boat
they
say
that
during
that
i
flung
myself
about
and
cast
bad
words
at
messer
giovanni
gaddi
to
wit
that
he
came
to
rob
me
and
not
from
any
motive
of
charity
and
other
insults
of
the
kind
which
caused
him
to
be
much
ashamed
later
on
they
say
i
lay
still
like
one
dead
and
after
waiting
by
me
more
than
an
hour
thinking
i
was
growing
cold
they
left
me
for
dead
when
they
returned
home
mattio
franzesi
was
informed
who
wrote
to
florence
to
messer
benedetto
varchi
my
very
dear
friend
that
they
had
seen
me
die
at
such
and
such
an
hour
of
the
night
when
he
heard
the
news
that
most
accomplished
man
and
my
dear
friend
composed
an
admirable
sonnet
upon
my
supposed
but
not
real
death
which
shall
be
reported
in
its
proper
place
more
than
three
long
hours
passed
and
yet
i
did
not
regain
consciousness
felice
having
used
all
the
remedies
prescribed
by
maestro
francesco
and
seeing
that
i
did
not
come
to
ran
to
the
door
and
knocked
so
loudly
that
he
woke
him
up
and
made
him
rise
and
begged
him
with
tears
to
come
to
the
house
for
he
thought
that
i
was
dead
whereto
maestro
francesco
who
was
a
very
choleric
man
replied
son
of
what
use
do
you
think
i
should
be
if
i
came
if
he
is
dead
i
am
more
sorry
than
you
are
do
you
imagine
that
if
i
were
to
come
with
my
medicine
i
could
blow
breath
up
through
his
guts
and
bring
him
back
to
life
for
you
but
when
he
saw
that
the
poor
young
fellow
was
going
away
weeping
he
called
him
back
and
gave
him
an
oil
with
which
to
anoint
my
pulses
and
my
heart
telling
him
to
pinch
my
little
fingers
and
toes
very
tightly
and
to
send
at
once
to
call
him
if
i
should
revive
felice
took
his
way
and
did
as
maestro
francesco
had
ordered
it
was
almost
bright
day
when
thinking
they
would
have
to
abandon
hope
they
gave
orders
to
have
my
shroud
made
and
to
wash
me
suddenly
i
regained
consciousness
and
called
out
to
felice
to
drive
away
the
old
man
on
the
moment
who
kept
tormenting
me
he
wanted
to
send
for
maestro
francesco
but
i
told
him
not
to
do
so
but
to
come
close
up
to
me
because
that
old
man
was
afraid
of
him
and
went
away
at
once
so
felice
drew
near
to
the
bed
i
touched
him
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
infuriated
old
man
withdrew
so
i
prayed
him
not
to
leave
me
for
a
second
when
maestro
francesco
appeared
he
said
it
was
his
dearest
wish
to
save
my
life
and
that
he
had
never
in
all
his
days
seen
greater
force
in
a
young
man
than
i
had
then
he
sat
down
to
write
and
prescribed
for
me
perfumes
lotions
unctions
plasters
and
a
heap
of
other
precious
things
meanwhile
i
came
to
life
again
by
the
means
of
more
than
twenty
leeches
applied
to
my
buttocks
but
with
my
body
bore
through
bound
and
ground
to
powder
many
of
my
friends
crowded
in
to
behold
the
miracle
of
the
resuscitated
dead
man
and
among
them
people
of
the
first
importance
in
their
presence
i
declared
that
the
small
amount
of
gold
and
money
i
possessed
perhaps
some
eight
hundred
crowns
what
with
gold
silver
jewels
and
cash
should
be
given
by
my
will
to
my
poor
sister
in
florence
called
mona
liperata
all
the
remainder
of
my
property
armour
and
everything
besides
i
left
to
my
dearest
felice
together
with
fifty
golden
ducats
in
order
that
he
might
buy
mourning
at
those
words
felice
flung
his
arms
around
my
neck
protesting
that
he
wanted
nothing
but
to
have
me
as
he
wished
alive
with
him
then
i
said
you
want
me
alive
touch
me
as
you
did
before
and
threaten
the
old
man
for
he
is
afraid
of
at
these
words
some
of
the
folk
were
terrified
knowing
that
i
was
not
raving
but
talking
to
the
purpose
and
with
all
my
wits
thus
my
wretched
malady
went
dragging
on
and
i
got
but
little
better
maestro
francesco
that
most
excellent
man
came
four
or
five
times
a
day
messer
giovanni
gaddi
who
felt
ashamed
did
not
visit
me
again
my
the
husband
of
my
sister
arrived
he
came
from
florence
for
the
inheritance
but
as
he
was
a
very
worthy
man
he
rejoiced
exceedingly
to
have
found
me
alive
the
sight
of
him
did
me
a
world
of
good
and
he
began
to
caress
me
at
once
saying
he
had
only
come
to
take
care
of
me
in
person
and
this
he
did
for
several
days
afterwards
i
sent
him
away
having
almost
certain
hope
of
my
recovery
on
this
occasion
he
left
the
sonnet
of
messer
benedetto
varchi
which
runs
as
follows
shall
mattio
yield
our
pain
relief
who
shall
forbid
the
sad
expense
of
tears
alas
true
that
in
his
youthful
years
our
friend
hath
flown
and
left
us
here
to
grief
hath
gone
up
to
heaven
who
was
the
chief
of
men
renowned
in
immortal
spheres
among
the
mighty
dead
he
had
no
peers
nor
shall
earth
see
his
like
in
my
belief
o
gentle
sprite
if
love
still
sway
the
blest
look
down
on
him
thou
here
didst
love
and
view
these
tears
that
mourn
my
loss
not
thy
great
good
dost
thou
gaze
on
his
beatitude
who
made
our
universe
and
findest
true
the
form
of
him
thy
skill

men

had

decease
lxxxv
my
sickness
had
been
of
such
a
very
serious
nature
that
it
seemed
impossible
for
me
to
fling
it
off
that
worthy
man
maestro
francesco
da
norcia
redoubled
his
efforts
and
brought
me
every
day
fresh
remedies
trying
to
restore
strength
to
my
miserable
unstrung
frame
yet
all
these
endeavours
were
apparently
insufficient
to
overcome
the
obstinacy
of
my
malady
so
that
the
physicians
were
in
despair
and
at
their
ends
what
to
do
i
was
tormented
by
thirst
but
had
abstained
from
drinking
for
many
days
according
to
the
orders
felice
who
thought
he
had
done
wonders
in
restoring
me
never
left
my
side
that
old
man
ceased
to
give
so
much
annoyance
yet
sometimes
he
appeared
to
me
in
dreams
one
day
felice
had
gone
out
of
doors
leaving
me
under
the
care
of
a
young
apprentice
and
a
called
beatrice
i
asked
the
apprentice
what
had
become
of
my
lad
cencio
and
what
was
the
reason
why
i
had
never
seen
him
in
attendance
on
me
the
boy
replied
that
cencio
had
been
far
more
ill
than
i
was
and
that
he
was
even
at
door
felice
had
given
them
orders
not
to
speak
to
me
of
this
on
hearing
the
news
i
was
exceedingly
distressed
then
i
called
the
maid
beatrice
a
pistojan
girl
and
asked
her
to
bring
me
a
great
crystal
which
stood
near
full
of
clear
and
fresh
water
she
ran
at
once
and
brought
it
to
me
full
i
told
her
to
put
it
to
my
lips
adding
that
if
she
let
me
take
a
draught
according
to
my
content
i
would
give
her
a
new
gown
this
maid
had
stolen
from
me
certain
little
things
of
some
importance
and
in
her
fear
of
being
detected
she
would
have
been
very
glad
if
i
had
died
accordingly
she
allowed
me
twice
to
take
as
much
as
i
could
of
the
water
so
that
in
good
earnest
i
swallowed
more
than
a
flask
full
i
then
covered
myself
and
began
to
sweat
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
after
i
had
slept
about
an
hour
felice
came
home
and
asked
the
boy
how
i
was
getting
on
he
answered
do
not
know
beatrice
brought
him
that
cooler
full
of
water
and
he
has
drunk
almost
the
whole
of
it
i
know
now
whether
he
is
alive
or
they
say
that
my
poor
friend
was
on
the
point
of
falling
to
the
ground
so
grieved
was
he
to
hear
this
afterwards
he
took
an
ugly
stick
and
began
to
beat
the
with
all
his
might
shouting
out
traitress
you
have
killed
him
for
me
then
while
felice
was
cudgelling
and
she
screaming
i
was
in
a
dream
i
thought
the
old
man
held
ropes
in
his
hand
and
while
he
was
preparing
to
bind
me
felice
had
arrived
and
struck
him
with
an
axe
so
that
the
old
man
fled
exclaiming
me
go
and
i
promise
not
to
return
for
a
long
beatrice
in
the
meantime
had
run
into
my
bedroom
shrieking
loudly
this
woke
me
up
and
i
called
out
her
alone
perhaps
when
she
meant
to
do
me
harm
she
did
me
more
good
than
you
were
able
to
do
with
all
your
efforts
she
may
indeed
have
saved
my
life
so
lend
me
a
helping
hand
for
i
have
sweated
and
be
quick
about
felice
recovered
his
spirits
dried
and
made
me
comfortable
and
i
being
conscious
of
a
great
improvement
in
my
state
began
to
reckon
on
recovery
when
maestro
francesco
appeared
and
saw
my
great
improvement
and
the
in
tears
and
the
prentice
running
to
and
fro
and
felice
laughing
all
this
disturbance
made
him
think
that
something
extraordinary
must
have
happened
which
had
been
the
cause
of
my
amendment
just
then
the
other
doctor
bernardino
put
in
his
appearance
who
at
the
beginning
of
my
illness
had
refused
to
bleed
me
maestro
francesco
that
most
able
man
exclaimed
power
of
nature
she
knows
what
she
requires
and
the
physicians
know
that
simpleton
maestro
bernardino
made
answer
saying
he
had
drunk
another
bottle
he
would
have
been
cured
upon
the
maestro
francesco
da
norcia
a
man
of
age
and
great
authority
said
would
have
been
a
terrible
misfortune
and
would
to
god
that
it
may
fall
on
you
afterwards
he
turned
to
me
and
asked
if
i
could
have
drunk
more
water
i
answered
because
i
had
entirely
quenched
my
then
he
turned
to
maestro
bernardino
and
said
you
how
nature
has
taken
precisely
what
she
wanted
neither
more
nor
less
in
like
manner
she
was
asking
for
what
she
wanted
when
the
poor
young
man
begged
you
to
bleed
him
if
you
knew
that
his
recovery
depended
upon
his
drinking
two
flasks
of
water
why
did
you
not
say
so
before
you
might
then
have
boasted
of
his
at
these
words
the
wretched
quack
sulkily
departed
and
never
showed
his
face
again
maestro
francesco
then
gave
orders
that
i
should
be
removed
from
my
room
and
carried
to
one
of
the
hills
there
are
in
rome
cardinal
cornaro
when
he
heard
of
my
improvement
had
me
transported
to
a
place
of
his
on
monte
cavallo
the
very
evening
i
was
taken
with
great
precautions
in
a
chair
well
wrapped
up
and
protected
from
the
cold
no
sooner
had
i
reached
the
place
than
i
began
to
vomit
during
which
there
came
from
my
stomach
a
hairy
worm
about
a
quarter
of
a
cubit
in
length
the
hairs
were
long
and
the
worm
was
very
ugly
speckled
of
divers
colours
green
black
and
red
they
kept
and
showed
it
to
the
doctor
who
said
he
had
never
seen
anything
of
the
sort
before
and
afterwards
remarked
to
felice
take
care
of
your
benvenuto
for
he
is
cured
do
not
permit
him
any
irregularities
for
though
he
has
escaped
this
time
another
disorder
now
would
be
the
death
of
him
you
see
his
malady
has
been
so
grave
that
if
we
had
brought
him
the
extreme
unction
we
might
not
have
been
in
time
now
i
know
that
with
a
little
patience
and
time
he
will
live
to
execute
more
of
his
fine
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
benvenuto
be
prudent
commit
no
excesses
and
when
you
are
quite
recovered
i
beg
you
to
make
me
a
madonna
with
your
own
hand
and
i
will
always
pay
my
devotions
to
it
for
your
this
i
promised
to
do
and
then
asked
him
whether
it
would
be
safe
for
me
to
travel
so
far
as
to
florence
he
advised
me
to
wait
till
i
was
stronger
and
till
we
could
observe
how
nature
worked
in
me
note
fiasco
holding
more
than
a
quart
lxxxvi
when
eight
days
had
come
and
gone
my
amendment
was
so
slight
that
life
itself
became
almost
a
burden
to
me
indeed
i
had
been
more
than
fifty
days
in
that
great
suffering
so
i
made
my
mind
up
and
prepared
to
travel
my
dear
felice
and
i
went
toward
florence
in
a
pair
of
baskets
and
as
i
had
not
written
when
i
reached
my
house
she
wept
and
laughed
over
me
all
in
one
breath
that
day
many
friends
came
to
see
me
among
others
pier
landi
who
was
the
best
and
dearest
friend
i
ever
had
next
day
there
came
a
certain
niccolň
da
monte
aguto
who
was
also
a
very
great
friend
of
mine
now
he
had
heard
the
duke
say
would
have
done
much
better
to
die
because
he
is
come
to
put
his
head
into
a
noose
and
i
will
never
pardon
accordingly
when
niccolň
arrived
he
said
to
me
in
desperation
my
dear
benvenuto
what
have
you
come
to
do
here
did
you
not
know
what
you
have
done
to
displease
the
duke
i
have
heard
him
swear
that
you
were
thrusting
your
head
into
a
then
i
replied
remind
his
excellency
that
pope
clement
wanted
to
do
as
much
to
me
before
and
quite
as
unjustly
tell
him
to
keep
his
eye
on
me
and
give
me
time
to
recover
then
i
will
show
his
excellency
that
i
have
been
the
most
faithful
servant
he
will
ever
have
in
all
his
life
and
forasmuch
as
some
enemy
must
have
served
me
this
bad
turn
through
envy
let
him
wait
till
i
get
well
for
i
shall
then
be
able
to
give
such
an
account
of
myself
as
will
make
him
this
bad
turn
had
been
done
me
by
giorgetto
vassellario
of
arezzo
the
painter
perchance
in
recompense
for
many
benefits
conferred
on
him
i
had
harboured
him
in
rome
and
provided
for
his
costs
while
he
had
turned
my
whole
house
upside
down
for
the
man
was
subject
to
a
species
of
dry
scab
which
he
was
always
in
the
habit
of
scratching
with
his
hands
it
happened
then
that
sleeping
in
the
same
bed
as
an
excellent
workman
named
manno
who
was
in
my
service
when
he
meant
to
scratch
himself
he
tore
the
skin
from
one
of
legs
with
his
filthy
claws
the
nails
of
which
he
never
used
to
cut
the
said
manno
left
my
service
and
was
resolutely
bent
on
killing
him
i
made
the
quarrel
up
and
afterwards
got
giorgio
into
cardinal
household
and
continually
helped
him
for
these
deserts
then
he
told
duke
alessandro
that
i
had
abused
his
excellency
and
had
bragged
i
meant
to
be
the
first
to
leap
upon
the
walls
of
florence
with
his
foes
the
exiles
these
words
as
i
afterwards
learned
had
been
put
into
lips
by
that
excellent
fellow
ottaviano
medici
who
wanted
to
revenge
himself
for
the
irritation
against
him
on
account
of
the
coinage
and
my
departure
from
florence
i
being
innocent
of
the
crime
falsely
ascribed
to
me
felt
no
fear
whatever
meanwhile
that
able
physician
francesco
da
monte
varchi
attended
to
my
cure
with
great
skill
he
had
been
brought
by
my
very
dear
friend
luca
martini
who
passed
the
larger
portion
of
the
day
with
me
note
paio
di
ceste
a
kind
of
litter
here
described
in
the
plural
because
two
of
them
were
perhaps
put
together
i
have
thought
it
best
to
translate
the
phrase
literally
from
a
letter
of
varchi
to
bembo
we
learn
that
cellini
reached
florence
november
note
this
is
the
famous
giorgio
vasari
a
bad
painter
and
worse
architect
but
dear
to
all
lovers
of
the
arts
for
his
anecdotic
work
upon
italian
artists
note
used
ironically
note
luca
martini
was
a
member
of
the
best
literary
society
in
his
days
and
the
author
of
some
famous
burlesque
pieces
lxxxvii
during
this
while
i
had
sent
my
devoted
comrade
felice
back
to
rome
to
look
after
our
business
there
when
i
could
raise
my
head
a
little
from
the
bolster
which
was
at
the
end
of
fifteen
days
although
i
was
unable
to
walk
upon
my
feet
i
had
myself
carried
to
the
palace
of
the
medici
and
placed
upon
the
little
upper
terrace
there
they
seated
me
to
wait
until
the
duke
went
by
many
of
my
friends
at
court
came
up
to
greet
me
and
expressed
surprise
that
i
had
undergone
the
inconvenience
of
being
carried
in
that
way
while
so
shattered
by
illness
they
said
that
i
ought
to
have
waited
till
i
was
well
and
then
to
have
visited
the
duke
a
crowd
of
them
collected
all
looking
at
me
as
a
sort
of
miracle
not
merely
because
they
had
heard
that
i
was
dead
but
far
more
because
i
had
the
look
of
a
dead
man
then
publicly
before
them
all
i
said
how
some
wicked
scoundrel
had
told
my
lord
the
duke
that
i
had
bragged
i
meant
to
be
the
first
to
scale
his
walls
and
also
that
i
had
abused
him
personally
wherefore
i
had
not
the
heart
to
live
or
die
till
i
had
purged
myself
of
that
infamy
and
found
out
who
the
audacious
rascal
was
who
had
uttered
such
calumnies
against
me
at
these
words
a
large
number
of
those
gentlemen
came
round
expressing
great
compassion
for
me
one
said
one
thing
one
another
and
i
told
them
i
would
never
go
thence
before
i
knew
who
had
accused
me
at
these
words
maestro
agostino
the
tailor
made
his
way
through
all
those
gentlemen
and
said
that
is
all
you
want
to
know
you
shall
know
it
at
this
very
giorgio
the
painter
whom
i
have
mentioned
happened
just
then
to
pass
and
maestro
agostino
exclaimed
is
the
man
who
accused
you
now
you
know
yourself
if
it
be
true
or
as
fiercely
as
i
could
not
being
able
to
leave
my
seat
i
asked
giorgio
if
it
was
true
that
he
had
accused
me
he
denied
that
it
was
so
and
that
he
had
ever
said
anything
of
the
sort
maestro
agostino
retorted
you
know
that
i
know
it
for
most
certain
giorgio
made
off
as
quickly
as
he
could
repeating
that
he
had
not
accused
me
then
after
a
short
while
the
duke
came
by
whereupon
i
had
myself
raised
up
before
his
excellency
and
he
halted
i
told
him
that
i
had
come
therein
that
way
solely
in
order
to
clear
my
character
the
duke
gazed
at
me
and
marvelled
i
was
still
alive
afterwards
he
bade
me
take
heed
to
be
an
honest
man
and
regain
my
health
when
i
reached
home
niccolň
da
monte
aguto
came
to
visit
me
and
told
me
that
i
had
escaped
one
of
the
most
dreadful
perils
in
the
world
quite
contrary
to
all
his
expectations
for
he
had
seen
my
ruin
written
with
indelible
ink
now
i
must
make
haste
to
get
well
and
afterwards
take
french
leave
because
my
jeopardy
came
from
a
quarter
and
a
man
who
was
able
to
destroy
me
he
then
said
and
added
displeasure
have
you
given
to
that
rascal
ottaviano
medici
i
answered
that
i
had
done
nothing
to
displease
him
but
that
he
had
injured
me
and
told
him
all
the
affair
about
the
mint
he
repeated
hence
as
quickly
as
you
can
and
be
of
good
courage
for
you
will
see
your
vengeance
executed
sooner
than
you
i
the
best
attention
to
my
health
gave
pietro
pagolo
advice
about
stamping
the
coins
and
then
went
off
upon
my
way
to
rome
without
saying
a
word
to
the
duke
or
anybody
else
lxxxviii
when
i
reached
rome
and
had
enjoyed
the
company
of
my
friends
awhile
i
began
the
medal
in
a
few
days
i
finished
the
head
in
steel
and
it
was
the
finest
work
of
the
kind
which
i
had
ever
produced
at
least
once
every
day
there
came
to
visit
me
a
sort
of
blockhead
named
messer
francesco
soderini
when
he
saw
what
i
was
doing
he
used
frequently
to
exclaim
wretch
you
want
them
to
immortalise
that
ferocious
tyrant
you
have
never
made
anything
so
exquisite
which
proves
you
our
inveterate
foe
and
their
devoted
friend
and
yet
the
pope
and
he
have
had
it
twice
in
mind
to
hang
you
without
any
fault
of
yours
that
was
the
father
and
the
son
now
beware
of
the
holy
it
was
firmly
believed
that
duke
alessandro
was
the
son
of
pope
clement
messer
francesco
used
also
to
say
and
swear
by
all
his
saints
that
if
he
could
he
would
have
robbed
me
of
the
dies
for
that
medal
i
responded
that
he
had
done
well
to
tell
me
so
and
that
i
would
take
such
care
of
them
that
he
should
never
see
them
more
i
now
sent
to
florence
to
request
lorenzino
that
he
would
send
me
the
reverse
of
the
medal
niccolň
da
monte
aguto
to
whom
i
had
written
wrote
back
saying
that
he
had
spoken
to
that
mad
melancholy
philosopher
lorenzino
for
it
he
had
replied
that
he
was
thinking
night
and
day
of
nothing
else
and
that
he
would
finish
it
as
soon
as
he
was
able
nevertheless
i
was
not
to
set
my
hopes
upon
his
reverse
but
i
had
better
invent
one
out
of
my
own
head
and
when
i
had
finished
it
i
might
bring
it
without
hesitation
to
the
duke
for
this
would
be
to
my
advantage
i
composed
the
design
of
a
reverse
which
seemed
to
me
appropriate
and
pressed
the
work
forward
to
my
best
ability
not
being
however
yet
recovered
from
that
terrible
illness
i
gave
myself
frequent
relaxation
by
going
out
on
fowling
expeditions
with
my
friend
felice
this
man
had
no
skill
in
my
art
but
since
we
were
perpetually
day
and
night
together
everybody
thought
he
was
a
craftsman
this
being
so
as
he
was
a
fellow
of
much
humour
we
used
often
to
laugh
together
about
the
great
credit
he
had
gained
his
name
was
felice
guadagni
gain
which
made
him
say
in
jest
should
be
called
felice
if
you
had
not
enabled
me
to
acquire
such
credit
that
i
can
call
myself
i
replied
that
there
are
two
ways
of
gaining
the
first
is
that
by
which
one
gains
for
self
the
second
that
by
which
one
gains
for
others
so
i
praised
him
much
more
for
the
second
than
the
first
since
he
had
gained
for
me
my
life
we
often
held
such
conversations
but
i
remember
one
in
particular
on
the
day
of
epiphany
when
we
were
together
near
la
magliana
it
was
close
upon
nightfall
and
during
the
day
i
had
shot
a
good
number
of
ducks
and
geese
then
as
i
had
almost
made
my
mind
up
to
shoot
no
more
that
time
we
were
returning
briskly
toward
rome
calling
to
my
dog
by
his
name
barucco
and
not
seeing
him
in
front
of
me
i
turned
round
and
noticed
that
the
animal
was
pointing
at
some
geese
which
had
settled
in
a
ditch
i
therefore
dismounted
at
once
got
my
ready
and
at
a
very
long
range
brought
two
of
them
down
with
a
single
ball
i
never
used
to
shoot
with
more
than
one
ball
and
was
usually
able
to
hit
my
mark
at
two
hundred
cubits
which
can
not
be
done
by
other
ways
of
loading
of
the
two
geese
one
was
almost
dead
and
the
other
though
badly
wounded
was
flying
lamely
my
dog
retrieved
the
one
and
brought
it
to
me
but
noticing
that
the
other
was
diving
down
into
the
ditch
i
sprang
forward
to
catch
it
trusting
to
my
boots
which
came
high
up
the
leg
i
put
one
foot
forward
it
sank
in
the
oozy
ground
and
so
although
i
got
the
goose
the
boot
of
my
right
leg
was
full
of
water
i
lifted
my
foot
and
let
the
water
run
out
then
when
i
had
mounted
we
made
haste
for
rome
the
cold
however
was
very
great
and
i
felt
my
leg
freeze
so
that
i
said
to
felice
must
do
something
to
help
this
leg
for
i
know
how
to
bear
it
the
good
felice
without
a
word
leapt
from
his
horse
and
gathering
some
thistles
and
bits
of
stick
began
to
build
a
fire
i
meanwhile
was
waiting
and
put
my
hands
among
the
of
the
geese
and
felt
them
very
warm
so
i
told
him
not
to
make
the
fire
but
filled
my
boot
with
the
feathers
of
the
goose
and
was
immediately
so
much
comforted
that
i
regained
vitality
note
he
had
been
banished
in
as
a
foe
to
the
medicean
house
lxxxix
we
mounted
and
rode
rapidly
toward
rome
and
when
we
had
reached
a
certain
gently
rising
had
already
in
the
direction
of
florence
both
with
one
breath
exclaimed
in
the
utmost
astonishment
god
of
heaven
what
is
that
great
thing
one
sees
there
over
florence
it
resembled
a
huge
beam
of
fire
which
sparkled
and
gave
out
extraordinary
lustre
i
said
to
felice
we
shall
hear
that
something
of
vast
importance
has
happened
in
as
we
rode
into
rome
the
darkness
was
extreme
and
when
we
came
near
the
banchi
and
our
own
house
my
little
horse
was
going
in
an
amble
at
a
furious
speed
now
that
day
they
had
thrown
a
heap
of
plaster
and
broken
tiles
in
the
middle
of
the
road
which
neither
my
horse
nor
myself
perceived
in
his
fiery
pace
the
beast
ran
up
it
but
on
coming
down
upon
the
other
side
he
turned
a
complete
somersault
he
had
his
head
between
his
legs
and
it
was
only
through
the
power
of
god
himself
that
i
escaped
unhurt
the
noise
we
made
brought
the
neighbours
out
with
lights
but
i
had
already
jumped
to
my
feet
and
so
without
remounting
i
ran
home
laughing
to
have
come
unhurt
out
of
an
accident
enough
to
break
my
neck
on
entering
the
house
i
found
some
friends
of
mine
there
to
whom
while
we
were
supping
together
i
related
the
adventures
of
the
chase
and
the
diabolical
apparition
of
the
fiery
beam
which
we
had
seen
they
exclaimed
shall
we
hear
which
this
portent
has
announced
i
answered
revolution
must
certainly
have
occurred
in
so
we
supped
agreeably
and
late
the
next
day
there
came
the
news
to
rome
of
duke
death
upon
this
many
of
my
acquaintances
came
to
me
and
said
were
right
in
conjecturing
that
something
of
great
importance
had
happened
at
just
then
francesco
soderini
appeared
jogging
along
upon
a
wretched
mule
he
had
and
laughing
all
the
way
like
a
madman
he
said
to
me
is
the
reverse
of
that
vile
medal
which
your
lorenzino
medici
promised
then
he
added
wanted
to
immortalise
the
dukes
for
us
but
we
mean
to
have
no
more
dukes
and
thereupon
he
jeered
me
as
though
i
had
been
the
captain
of
the
factions
which
make
dukes
meanwhile
a
certain
baccio
bettini
who
had
an
ugly
big
head
like
a
bushel
came
up
and
began
to
banter
me
in
the
same
way
about
dukes
calling
out
have
them
and
have
any
more
of
them
and
you
were
for
making
them
immortal
for
us
with
many
other
tiresome
quips
of
the
same
kind
i
lost
my
patience
at
this
nonsense
and
said
to
them
blockheads
i
am
a
poor
goldsmith
who
serve
whoever
pays
me
and
you
are
jeering
me
as
though
i
were
a
however
this
shall
not
make
me
cast
in
your
teeth
the
insatiable
greediness
idiotcy
and
of
your
predecessors
but
this
one
answer
i
will
make
to
all
your
silly
railleries
that
before
two
or
three
days
at
the
longest
have
passed
by
you
will
have
another
duke
much
worse
perhaps
than
he
who
now
has
left
the
following
day
bettini
came
to
my
shop
and
said
is
no
need
to
spend
money
in
couriers
for
you
know
things
before
they
happen
what
spirit
tells
them
to
you
then
he
informed
me
that
cosimo
medici
the
son
of
signor
giovanni
was
made
duke
but
that
certain
conditions
had
been
imposed
at
his
election
which
would
hold
him
back
from
kicking
up
his
heels
at
his
own
pleasure
i
now
had
my
opportunity
for
laughing
at
them
and
saying
men
of
florence
have
set
a
young
man
upon
a
mettlesome
horse
next
they
have
buckled
spurs
upon
his
heels
and
put
the
bridle
freely
in
his
hands
and
turned
him
out
upon
a
magnificent
field
full
of
flowers
and
fruits
and
all
delightful
things
next
they
have
bidden
him
not
to
cross
certain
indicated
limits
now
tell
me
you
who
there
is
that
can
hold
him
back
whenever
he
has
but
the
mind
to
cross
them
laws
can
not
be
imposed
on
him
who
is
the
master
of
the
so
they
left
me
alone
and
gave
me
no
further
annoyance
note
alessandro
was
murdered
by
his
cousin
lorenzino
at
florence
on
the
of
january
note
bettini
was
an
intimate
friend
of
buonarroti
and
a
considerable
patron
of
the
arts
note
this
exchange
of
ironical
compliments
testifies
to
strong
medicean
leanings
and
also
to
the
sagacity
with
which
he
judged
the
political
situation
note
cellini
only
spoke
the
truth
on
this
occasion
for
cosimo
soon
kicked
down
the
ladder
which
had
lifted
him
to
sovereignty
and
showed
himself
the
absolute
master
of
florence
cosimo
was
elected
duke
upon
the
of
january
xc
i
now
began
to
attend
to
my
shop
and
did
some
business
not
however
of
much
moment
because
i
had
still
to
think
about
my
health
which
was
not
yet
established
after
that
grave
illness
i
had
undergone
about
this
time
the
emperor
returned
victorious
from
his
expedition
against
tunis
and
the
pope
sent
for
me
to
take
my
advice
concerning
the
present
of
honour
it
was
fit
to
give
him
i
answered
that
it
seemed
to
me
most
appropriate
to
present
his
imperial
majesty
with
a
golden
crucifix
for
which
i
had
almost
finished
an
ornament
quite
to
the
purpose
and
which
would
confer
the
highest
honour
upon
his
holiness
and
me
i
had
already
made
three
little
figures
of
gold
in
the
round
about
a
palm
high
they
were
those
which
i
had
begun
for
the
chalice
of
pope
clement
representing
faith
hope
and
charity
to
these
i
added
in
wax
what
was
wanting
for
the
basement
of
the
cross
i
carried
the
whole
to
the
pope
with
the
christ
in
wax
and
many
other
exquisite
decorations
which
gave
him
complete
satisfaction
before
i
took
leave
of
his
holiness
we
had
agreed
on
every
detail
and
calculated
the
price
of
the
work
this
was
one
evening
four
hours
after
nightfall
and
the
pope
had
ordered
messer
latino
juvenale
to
see
that
i
had
money
paid
to
me
next
morning
this
messer
latino
who
had
a
pretty
big
dash
of
the
fool
in
his
composition
bethought
him
of
furnishing
the
pope
with
a
new
idea
which
was
however
wholly
of
his
own
invention
so
he
altered
everything
which
had
been
arranged
and
next
morning
when
i
went
for
the
money
he
said
with
his
usual
brutal
arrogance
is
our
part
to
invent
and
yours
to
execute
before
i
left
the
pope
last
night
we
thought
of
something
far
to
these
first
words
i
answered
without
allowing
him
to
proceed
farther
you
nor
the
pope
can
think
of
anything
better
than
a
piece
of
which
christ
plays
a
part
so
you
may
go
on
with
your
nonsense
till
you
have
no
more
to
without
uttering
one
word
he
left
me
in
a
rage
and
tried
to
get
the
work
given
to
another
goldsmith
the
pope
however
refused
and
sent
for
me
at
once
and
told
me
i
had
spoken
well
but
that
they
wanted
to
make
use
of
a
book
of
hours
of
our
lady
which
was
marvellously
illuminated
and
had
cost
the
cardinal
medici
more
than
two
thousand
crowns
they
thought
that
this
would
be
an
appropriate
present
to
the
empress
and
that
for
the
emperor
they
would
afterwards
make
what
i
had
suggested
which
was
indeed
a
present
worthy
of
him
but
now
there
was
no
time
to
lose
since
the
emperor
was
expected
in
rome
in
about
a
month
and
a
half
he
wanted
the
book
to
be
enclosed
in
a
case
of
massive
gold
richly
worked
and
adorned
with
jewels
valued
at
about
six
thousand
crowns
accordingly
when
the
jewels
and
the
gold
were
given
me
i
began
the
work
and
driving
it
briskly
forward
in
a
few
days
brought
it
to
such
beauty
that
the
pope
was
astonished
and
showed
me
the
most
distinguished
signs
of
favour
conceding
at
the
same
time
that
that
beast
juvenale
should
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
me
i
had
nearly
brought
my
work
to
its
completion
when
the
emperor
arrived
and
numerous
triumphal
arches
of
great
magnificence
were
erected
in
his
honour
he
entered
rome
with
extraordinary
pomp
the
description
of
which
i
leave
to
others
since
i
mean
to
treat
of
those
things
only
which
concern
myself
immediately
after
his
arrival
he
gave
the
pope
a
diamond
which
he
had
bought
for
twelve
thousand
crowns
this
diamond
the
pope
committed
to
my
care
ordering
me
to
make
a
ring
to
the
measure
of
his
finger
but
first
he
wished
me
to
bring
the
book
in
the
state
to
which
i
had
advanced
it
i
took
it
accordingly
and
he
was
highly
pleased
with
it
then
he
asked
my
advice
concerning
the
apology
which
could
be
reasonably
made
to
the
emperor
for
the
unfinished
condition
of
my
work
i
said
that
my
indisposition
would
furnish
a
sound
excuse
since
his
majesty
seeing
how
thin
and
pale
i
was
would
very
readily
believe
and
accept
it
to
this
the
pope
replied
that
he
approved
of
the
suggestion
but
that
i
should
add
on
the
part
of
his
holiness
when
i
presented
the
book
to
the
emperor
that
i
made
him
the
present
of
myself
then
he
told
me
in
detail
how
i
had
to
behave
and
the
words
i
had
to
say
these
words
i
repeated
to
the
pope
asking
him
if
he
wished
me
to
deliver
them
in
that
way
he
replied
would
acquit
yourself
to
admiration
if
you
had
the
courage
to
address
the
emperor
as
you
are
addressing
then
i
said
that
i
had
the
courage
to
speak
with
far
greater
ease
and
freedom
to
the
emperor
seeing
that
the
emperor
was
clothed
as
i
was
and
that
i
should
seem
to
be
speaking
to
a
man
formed
like
myself
this
was
not
the
case
when
i
addressed
his
holiness
in
whom
i
beheld
a
far
superior
deity
both
by
reason
of
his
ecclesiastical
adornments
which
shed
a
certain
aureole
about
him
and
at
the
same
time
because
of
his
dignity
of
venerable
age
all
these
things
inspired
in
me
more
awe
than
the
imperial
majesty
to
these
words
the
pope
responded
my
benvenuto
you
are
a
man
of
ability
do
us
honour
and
it
will
be
well
for
note
cellini
returns
to
the
year
when
charles
arrived
in
november
from
tunis
note
the
entry
into
rome
took
place
april
xci
the
pope
ordered
out
two
turkish
horses
which
had
belonged
to
pope
clement
and
were
the
most
beautiful
that
ever
came
to
christendom
messer
durante
his
chamberlain
was
bidden
to
bring
them
through
the
lower
galleries
of
the
palace
and
there
to
give
them
to
the
emperor
repeating
certain
words
which
his
holiness
dictated
to
him
we
both
went
down
together
and
when
we
reached
the
presence
of
the
emperor
the
horses
made
their
entrance
through
those
halls
with
so
much
spirit
and
such
a
noble
carriage
that
the
emperor
and
every
one
were
struck
with
wonder
thereupon
messer
durante
advanced
in
so
graceless
a
manner
and
delivered
his
speech
with
so
much
of
brescian
lingo
mumbling
his
words
over
in
his
mouth
that
one
never
saw
or
heard
anything
worse
indeed
the
emperor
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
at
him
i
meanwhile
had
already
uncovered
my
piece
and
observing
that
the
emperor
had
turned
his
eyes
towards
me
with
a
very
gracious
look
i
advanced
at
once
and
said
majesty
our
most
holy
father
pope
paolo
sends
this
book
of
the
virgin
as
a
present
to
your
majesty
the
which
is
written
in
a
fair
hand
and
illuminated
by
the
greatest
master
who
ever
professed
that
art
and
this
rich
cover
of
gold
and
jewels
is
unfinished
as
you
here
behold
it
by
reason
of
my
illness
wherefore
his
holiness
together
with
the
book
presents
me
also
and
attaches
me
to
your
majesty
in
order
that
i
may
complete
the
work
nor
this
alone
but
everything
which
you
may
have
it
in
your
mind
to
execute
so
long
as
life
is
left
me
will
i
perform
at
your
thereto
the
emperor
responded
book
is
acceptable
to
me
and
so
are
you
but
i
desire
you
to
complete
it
for
me
in
rome
when
it
is
finished
and
you
are
restored
to
health
bring
it
me
and
come
to
see
afterwards
in
course
of
conversation
he
called
me
by
my
name
which
made
me
wonder
because
no
words
had
been
dropped
in
which
my
name
occurred
and
he
said
that
he
had
seen
that
fastening
of
pope
cope
on
which
i
had
wrought
so
many
wonderful
figures
we
continued
talking
in
this
way
a
whole
half
hour
touching
on
divers
topics
artistic
and
agreeable
then
since
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
acquitted
myself
with
more
honour
than
i
had
expected
i
took
the
occasion
of
a
slight
lull
in
the
conversation
to
make
my
bow
and
to
retire
the
emperor
was
heard
to
say
five
hundred
golden
crowns
be
given
at
once
to
the
person
who
brought
them
up
asked
who
the
man
was
who
had
spoken
to
the
emperor
messer
durante
came
forward
and
robbed
me
of
my
five
hundred
crowns
i
complained
to
the
pope
who
told
me
not
to
be
uneasy
for
he
knew
how
everything
had
happened
and
how
well
i
had
conducted
myself
in
addressing
the
emperor
and
of
the
money
i
should
certainly
obtain
my
share
note
messer
durante
duranti
prefect
of
the
camera
under
paul
iii
who
gave
him
the
hat
in
and
the
bishopric
of
brescia
afterwards
xcii
when
i
returned
to
my
shop
i
set
my
hand
with
diligence
to
finishing
the
diamond
ring
concerning
which
the
four
first
jewellers
of
rome
were
sent
to
consult
with
me
this
was
because
the
pope
had
been
informed
that
the
diamond
had
been
set
by
the
first
jeweller
of
the
world
in
venice
he
was
called
maestro
miliano
targhetta
and
the
diamond
being
somewhat
thin
the
job
of
setting
it
was
too
difficult
to
be
attempted
without
great
deliberation
i
was
well
pleased
to
receive
these
four
jewellers
among
whom
was
a
man
of
milan
called
gaio
he
was
the
most
presumptuous
donkey
in
the
world
the
one
who
knew
least
and
who
thought
he
knew
most
the
others
were
very
modest
and
able
craftsmen
in
the
presence
of
us
all
this
gaio
began
to
talk
and
said
foil
should
be
preserved
and
to
do
that
benvenuto
you
shall
doff
your
cap
for
just
as
giving
diamonds
a
tint
is
the
most
delicate
and
difficult
thing
in
the
art
so
is
miliano
the
greatest
jeweller
that
ever
lived
and
this
is
the
most
difficult
diamond
to
i
replied
that
it
was
all
the
greater
glory
for
me
to
compete
with
so
able
a
master
in
such
an
excellent
profession
afterwards
i
turned
to
the
other
jewellers
and
said
here
i
am
keeping
foil
and
i
will
see
whether
i
can
improve
on
it
with
some
of
my
own
manufacture
if
not
we
will
tint
it
with
the
same
you
see
that
ass
gaio
exclaimed
that
if
i
made
a
foil
like
that
he
would
gladly
doff
his
cap
to
it
to
which
i
replied
then
i
make
it
better
it
will
deserve
two
so
said
he
and
i
began
to
compose
my
foils
i
took
the
very
greatest
pains
in
mixing
the
tints
the
method
of
doing
which
i
will
explain
in
the
proper
place
it
is
certain
that
the
diamond
in
question
offered
more
difficulties
than
any
others
which
before
or
afterwards
have
come
into
my
hands
and
foil
was
made
with
true
artistic
skill
however
that
did
not
dismay
me
but
having
sharpened
my
wits
up
i
succeeded
not
only
in
making
something
quite
as
good
but
in
exceeding
it
by
far
then
when
i
saw
that
i
had
surpassed
him
i
went
about
to
surpass
myself
and
produced
a
foil
by
new
processes
which
was
a
long
way
better
than
what
i
had
previously
made
thereupon
i
sent
for
the
jewellers
and
first
i
tinted
the
diamond
with
foil
then
i
cleaned
it
well
and
tinted
it
afresh
with
my
own
when
i
showed
it
to
the
jewellers
one
of
the
best
among
them
who
was
called
raffael
del
moro
took
the
diamond
in
his
hand
and
said
to
gaio
has
outdone
the
foil
of
gaio
unwilling
to
believe
it
took
the
diamond
and
said
this
diamond
is
worth
two
thousand
ducats
more
than
with
the
foil
of
i
rejoined
that
i
have
surpassed
miliano
let
us
see
if
i
can
surpass
then
i
begged
them
to
wait
for
me
a
while
went
up
into
a
little
cabinet
and
having
tinted
the
diamond
anew
unseen
by
them
returned
and
showed
it
to
the
jewellers
gaio
broke
out
at
once
is
the
most
marvellous
thing
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
course
of
my
whole
lifetime
the
stone
is
worth
upwards
of
eighteen
thousand
crowns
whereas
we
valued
it
at
barely
twelve
the
others
jewellers
turned
to
him
and
said
is
the
glory
of
our
art
and
it
is
only
due
that
we
should
doff
our
caps
to
him
and
to
his
then
gaio
said
shall
go
and
tell
the
pope
and
i
mean
to
procure
for
him
one
thousand
golden
crowns
for
the
setting
of
this
accordingly
he
hurried
to
the
pope
and
told
him
the
whole
story
whereupon
his
holiness
sent
three
times
on
that
day
to
see
if
the
ring
was
finished
at
i
took
the
ring
to
the
palace
and
since
the
doors
were
always
open
to
me
i
lifted
the
curtain
gently
and
saw
the
pope
in
private
audience
with
the
marchese
del
guasto
the
marquis
must
have
been
pressing
something
on
the
pope
which
he
was
unwilling
to
perform
for
i
heard
him
say
tell
you
no
it
is
my
business
to
remain
neutral
and
nothing
i
was
retiring
as
quickly
as
i
could
when
the
pope
himself
called
me
back
so
i
entered
the
room
and
presented
the
diamond
ring
upon
which
he
drew
me
aside
and
the
marquis
retired
to
a
distance
while
looking
at
the
diamond
the
pope
whispered
to
me
begin
some
conversation
with
me
on
a
subject
which
shall
seem
important
and
do
not
stop
talking
so
long
as
the
marquis
remains
in
this
then
he
took
to
walking
up
and
down
and
the
occasion
making
for
my
advantage
i
was
very
glad
to
discourse
with
him
upon
the
methods
i
had
used
to
tint
the
stone
the
marquis
remained
standing
apart
leaning
against
a
piece
of
tapestry
and
now
he
balanced
himself
about
on
one
foot
now
on
the
other
the
subject
i
had
chosen
to
discourse
upon
was
of
such
importance
if
fully
treated
that
i
could
have
talked
about
it
at
least
three
hours
the
pope
was
entertained
to
such
a
degree
that
he
forgot
the
annoyance
of
the
marquis
standing
there
i
seasoned
what
i
had
to
say
with
that
part
of
natural
philosophy
which
belongs
to
our
profession
and
so
having
spoken
for
near
upon
an
hour
the
marquis
grew
tired
of
waiting
and
went
off
fuming
then
the
pope
bestowed
on
me
the
most
familiar
caresses
which
can
be
imagined
and
exclaimed
patience
my
dear
benvenuto
for
i
will
give
you
a
better
reward
for
your
virtues
than
the
thousand
crowns
which
gaio
tells
me
your
work
is
on
this
i
took
my
leave
and
the
pope
praised
me
in
the
presence
of
his
household
among
whom
was
the
fellow
latino
juvenale
whom
i
have
previously
mentioned
this
man
having
become
my
enemy
assiduously
strove
to
do
me
hurt
and
noticing
that
the
pope
talked
of
me
with
so
much
affection
and
warmth
he
put
in
his
word
is
no
doubt
at
all
that
benvenuto
is
a
person
of
very
remarkable
genius
but
while
every
one
is
naturally
bound
to
feel
more
goodwill
for
his
own
countrymen
than
for
others
still
one
ought
to
consider
maturely
what
language
it
is
right
and
proper
to
use
when
speaking
of
a
pope
he
has
had
the
audacity
to
say
that
pope
clement
indeed
was
the
handsomest
sovereign
that
ever
reigned
and
no
less
gifted
only
that
luck
was
always
against
him
and
he
says
that
your
holiness
is
quite
the
opposite
that
the
tiara
seems
to
weep
for
rage
upon
your
head
that
you
look
like
a
truss
of
straw
with
clothes
on
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
you
except
good
these
words
reported
by
a
man
who
knew
most
excellently
how
to
say
them
had
such
force
that
they
gained
credit
with
the
pope
far
from
having
uttered
them
such
things
had
never
come
into
my
head
if
the
pope
could
have
done
so
without
losing
credit
he
would
certainly
have
taken
fierce
revenge
upon
me
but
being
a
man
of
great
tact
and
talent
he
made
a
show
of
turning
it
off
with
a
laugh
nevertheless
he
harboured
in
his
heart
a
deep
vindictive
feeling
against
me
of
which
i
was
not
slow
to
be
aware
since
i
had
no
longer
the
same
easy
access
to
his
apartments
as
formerly
but
found
the
greatest
difficulty
in
procuring
audience
as
i
had
now
for
many
years
been
familiar
with
the
manners
of
the
roman
court
i
conceived
that
some
one
had
done
me
a
bad
turn
and
on
making
dexterous
inquiries
i
was
told
the
whole
but
not
the
name
of
my
calumniator
i
could
not
imagine
who
the
man
was

but
found
him

my
vengeance

not
have
been
measured

i
went
on
working
at
my
book
and
when
i
had
finished
it
i
took
it
to
the
pope
who
was
in
good
truth
unable
to
refrain
from
commending
it
greatly
i
begged
him
to
send
me
with
it
to
the
emperor
as
he
had
promised
he
replied
that
he
would
do
what
he
thought
fit
and
that
i
had
performed
my
part
of
the
business
so
he
gave
orders
that
i
should
be
well
paid
these
two
pieces
of
work
on
which
i
had
spent
upwards
of
two
months
brought
me
in
five
hundred
crowns
for
the
diamond
i
was
paid
one
hundred
and
fifty
crowns
and
no
more
the
rest
was
given
me
for
the
cover
of
the
book
which
however
was
worth
more
than
a
thousand
being
enriched
with
multitudes
of
figures
arabesques
enamellings
and
jewels
i
took
what
i
could
get
and
made
my
mind
up
to
leave
rome
without
permission
the
pope
meanwhile
sent
my
book
to
the
emperor
by
the
hand
of
his
grandson
signor
sforza
upon
accepting
it
the
emperor
expressed
great
satisfaction
and
immediately
asked
for
me
young
signor
sforza
who
had
received
his
instructions
said
that
i
had
been
prevented
by
illness
from
coming
all
this
was
reported
to
me
my
preparations
for
the
journey
into
france
were
made
and
i
wished
to
go
alone
but
was
unable
on
account
of
a
lad
in
my
service
called
ascanio
he
was
of
very
tender
age
and
the
most
admirable
servant
in
the
world
when
i
took
him
he
had
left
a
former
master
named
francesco
a
spaniard
and
a
goldsmith
i
did
not
much
like
to
take
him
lest
i
should
get
into
a
quarrel
with
the
spaniard
and
said
to
ascanio
do
not
want
to
have
you
for
fear
of
offending
your
he
contrived
that
his
master
should
write
me
a
note
informing
me
that
i
was
free
to
take
him
so
he
had
been
with
me
some
months
and
since
he
came
to
us
both
thin
and
pale
of
face
we
called
him
little
old
man
indeed
i
almost
thought
he
was
one
partly
because
he
was
so
good
a
servant
and
partly
because
he
was
so
clever
that
it
seemed
unlikely
he
should
have
such
talent
at
thirteen
years
which
he
affirmed
his
age
to
be
now
to
go
back
to
the
point
from
which
i
started
he
improved
in
person
during
those
few
months
and
gaining
in
flesh
became
the
handsomest
youth
in
rome
being
the
excellent
servant
which
i
have
described
and
showing
marvellous
aptitude
for
our
art
i
felt
a
warm
and
fatherly
affection
for
him
and
kept
him
clothed
as
if
he
had
been
my
own
son
when
the
boy
perceived
the
improvement
he
had
made
he
esteemed
it
a
good
piece
of
luck
that
he
had
come
into
my
hands
and
he
used
frequently
to
go
and
thank
his
former
master
who
had
been
the
cause
of
his
prosperity
now
this
man
had
a
handsome
young
woman
to
wife
who
said
to
him
that
was
what
they
called
him
when
he
lived
with
them
have
you
been
doing
to
become
so
handsome
ascanio
answered
francesca
it
is
my
master
who
has
made
me
so
handsome
and
far
more
good
to
in
her
petty
spiteful
way
she
took
it
very
ill
that
ascanio
should
speak
so
and
having
no
reputation
for
chastity
she
contrived
to
caress
the
lad
more
perhaps
than
was
quite
seemly
which
made
me
notice
that
he
began
to
visit
her
more
frequently
than
his
wont
had
been
one
day
ascanio
took
to
beating
one
of
our
little
shopboys
who
when
i
came
home
from
out
of
doors
complained
to
me
with
tears
that
ascanio
had
knocked
him
about
without
any
cause
hearing
this
i
said
to
ascanio
cause
or
without
cause
see
you
never
strike
any
one
of
my
family
or
else
make
you
feel
how
i
can
strike
he
bandied
words
with
me
which
made
me
jump
on
him
and
give
him
the
severest
drubbing
with
both
fists
and
feet
that
he
had
ever
felt
as
soon
as
he
escaped
my
clutches
he
ran
away
without
cape
or
cap
and
for
two
days
i
did
not
know
where
he
was
and
took
no
care
to
find
him
after
that
time
a
spanish
gentleman
called
don
diego
came
to
speak
to
me
he
was
the
most
generous
man
in
the
world
i
had
made
and
was
making
some
things
for
him
which
had
brought
us
well
acquainted
he
told
me
that
ascanio
had
gone
back
to
his
old
master
and
asked
me
if
i
thought
it
proper
to
send
him
the
cape
and
cap
which
i
had
given
him
thereupon
i
said
that
francesco
had
behaved
badly
and
like
a
fellow
for
if
he
had
told
me
when
ascanio
first
came
back
to
him
that
he
was
in
his
house
i
should
very
willingly
have
given
him
leave
but
now
that
he
had
kept
him
two
days
without
informing
me
i
was
resolved
he
should
not
have
him
and
let
him
take
care
that
i
do
not
set
eyes
upon
the
lad
in
his
house
this
message
was
reported
by
don
diego
but
it
only
made
francesco
laugh
the
next
morning
i
saw
ascanio
working
at
some
trifles
in
wire
at
his
side
as
i
was
passing
he
bowed
to
me
and
his
master
almost
laughed
me
in
the
face
he
sent
again
to
ask
through
don
diego
whether
i
would
not
give
ascanio
back
the
clothes
he
had
received
from
me
but
if
not
he
did
not
mind
and
ascanio
should
not
want
for
clothes
when
i
heard
this
i
turned
to
don
diego
and
said
diego
sir
in
all
your
dealings
you
are
the
most
liberal
and
worthy
man
i
ever
knew
but
that
francesco
is
quite
the
opposite
of
you
he
is
nothing
better
than
a
worthless
and
dishonoured
renegade
tell
him
from
me
that
if
he
does
not
bring
ascanio
here
himself
to
my
shop
before
the
bell
for
vespers
i
will
assuredly
kill
him
and
tell
ascanio
that
if
he
does
not
quit
that
house
at
the
hour
appointed
for
his
master
i
will
treat
him
much
in
the
same
don
diego
made
no
answer
but
went
and
inspired
such
terror
in
francesco
that
he
knew
not
what
to
do
with
himself
ascanio
meanwhile
had
gone
to
find
his
father
who
had
come
to
rome
from
tagliacozzo
his
birthplace
and
this
man
also
when
he
heard
about
the
row
advised
francesco
to
bring
ascanio
back
to
me
francesco
said
to
ascanio
on
your
own
account
and
your
father
shall
go
with
don
diego
put
in
i
foresee
that
something
very
serious
will
happen
you
know
better
than
i
do
what
a
man
benvenuto
is
take
the
lad
back
courageously
and
i
will
come
with
i
had
prepared
myself
and
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
shop
waiting
for
the
bell
to
vespers
my
mind
was
made
up
to
do
one
of
the
bloodiest
deeds
which
i
had
ever
attempted
in
my
life
just
then
arrived
don
diego
francesco
ascanio
and
his
father
whom
i
did
not
know
when
ascanio
entered
i
gazed
at
the
whole
company
with
eyes
of
rage
and
francesco
pale
as
death
began
as
follows
here
i
have
brought
back
ascanio
whom
i
kept
with
me
not
thinking
that
i
should
offend
ascanio
added
humbly
pardon
me
i
am
at
your
disposal
here
to
do
whatever
you
shall
then
i
said
you
come
to
work
out
the
time
you
promised
me
he
answered
yes
and
that
he
meant
never
to
leave
me
then
i
turned
and
told
the
shopboy
he
had
beaten
to
hand
him
the
bundle
of
clothes
and
said
to
him
are
all
the
clothes
i
gave
you
take
with
them
your
discharge
and
go
where
you
don
diego
stood
astonished
at
this
which
was
quite
the
contrary
of
what
he
had
expected
while
ascanio
with
his
father
besought
me
to
pardon
and
take
him
back
on
my
asking
who
it
was
who
spoke
for
him
he
said
it
was
his
father
to
whom
after
many
entreaties
i
replied
you
are
his
father
for
your
sake
i
will
take
him

farnese
the
natural
daughter
he
was
a
youth
of
sixteen
at
this
epoch
xciv
i
had
formed
the
resolution
as
i
said
a
short
while
back
to
go
toward
france
partly
because
i
saw
that
the
pope
did
not
hold
me
in
the
same
esteem
as
formerly
my
faithful
service
having
been
besmirched
by
lying
tongues
and
also
because
i
feared
lest
those
who
had
the
power
might
play
me
some
worse
trick
so
i
was
determined
to
seek
better
fortune
in
a
foreign
land
and
wished
to
leave
rome
without
company
or
license
on
the
eve
of
my
projected
departure
i
told
my
faithful
friend
felice
to
make
free
use
of
all
my
effects
during
my
absence
and
in
the
case
of
my
not
returning
left
him
everything
i
possessed
now
there
was
a
perugian
workman
in
my
employ
who
had
helped
me
on
those
commissions
from
the
pope
and
after
paying
his
wages
i
told
him
he
must
leave
my
service
he
begged
me
in
reply
to
let
him
go
with
me
and
said
he
would
come
at
his
own
charges
if
i
stopped
to
work
for
the
king
of
france
it
would
certainly
be
better
for
me
to
have
italians
by
me
and
in
particular
such
persons
as
i
knew
to
be
capable
of
giving
me
assistance
his
entreaties
and
arguments
persuaded
me
to
take
him
on
the
journey
in
the
manner
he
proposed
ascanio
who
was
present
at
this
debate
said
half
in
tears
you
took
me
back
i
said
i
wished
to
remain
with
you
my
lifetime
and
so
i
have
it
in
my
mind
to
i
told
him
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
make
me
consent
but
when
i
saw
that
the
poor
lad
was
preparing
to
follow
on
foot
i
engaged
a
horse
for
him
too
put
a
small
valise
upon
the
crupper
and
loaded
myself
with
far
more
useless
baggage
than
i
should
otherwise
have
taken
from
home
i
travelled
to
florence
from
florence
to
bologna
from
bologna
to
venice
and
from
venice
to
padua
there
my
dear
friend
albertaccio
del
bene
made
me
leave
the
inn
for
his
house
and
next
day
i
went
to
kiss
the
hand
of
messer
pietro
bembo
who
was
not
yet
a
cardinal
he
received
me
with
marks
of
the
warmest
affection
which
could
be
bestowed
on
any
man
then
turning
to
albertaccio
he
said
want
benvenuto
to
stay
here
with
all
his
followers
even
though
they
be
a
hundred
men
make
then
your
mind
up
if
you
want
benvenuto
also
to
stay
here
with
me
for
i
do
not
mean
elsewise
to
let
you
have
accordingly
i
spent
a
very
pleasant
visit
at
the
house
of
that
most
accomplished
gentleman
he
had
a
room
prepared
for
me
which
would
have
been
too
grand
for
a
cardinal
and
always
insisted
on
my
taking
my
meals
beside
him
later
on
he
began
to
hint
in
very
modest
terms
that
he
should
greatly
like
me
to
take
his
portrait
i
who
desired
nothing
in
the
world
more
prepared
some
plaster
in
a
little
box
and
set
to
work
at
once
the
first
day
i
spent
two
hours
on
end
at
my
modelling
and
blocked
out
the
fine
head
of
that
eminent
man
with
so
much
grace
of
manner
that
his
lordship
was
fairly
astounded
now
though
he
was
a
man
of
profound
erudition
and
without
a
rival
in
poetry
he
understood
nothing
at
all
about
my
art
this
made
him
think
that
i
had
finished
when
i
had
hardly
begun
so
that
i
could
not
make
him
comprehend
what
a
long
time
it
took
to
execute
a
thing
of
that
sort
thoroughly
at
last
i
resolved
to
do
it
as
well
as
i
was
able
and
to
spend
the
requisite
time
upon
it
but
since
he
wore
his
beard
short
after
the
venetian
fashion
i
had
great
trouble
in
modelling
a
head
to
my
own
satisfaction
however
i
finished
it
and
judged
it
about
the
finest
specimen
i
had
produced
in
all
the
points
pertaining
to
my
art
great
was
the
astonishment
of
messer
pietro
who
conceived
that
i
should
have
completed
the
waxen
model
in
two
hours
and
the
steel
in
ten
when
he
found
that
i
employed
two
hundred
on
the
wax
and
then
was
begging
for
leave
to
pursue
my
journey
toward
france
this
threw
him
into
much
concern
and
he
implored
me
at
least
to
design
the
reverse
for
his
medal
which
was
to
be
a
pegasus
encircled
with
a
wreath
of
myrtle
i
performed
my
task
in
the
space
of
some
three
hours
and
gave
it
a
fine
air
of
elegance
he
was
exceedingly
delighted
and
said
horse
seems
to
me
ten
times
more
difficult
to
do
than
the
little
portrait
on
which
you
have
bestowed
so
much
pains
i
can
not
understand
what
made
it
such
a
all
the
same
he
kept
entreating
me
to
execute
the
piece
in
steel
exclaiming
sake
do
it
i
know
that
if
you
choose
you
will
get
it
quickly
i
told
him
that
i
was
not
willing
to
make
it
there
but
promised
without
fail
to
take
it
in
hand
wherever
i
might
stop
to
work
while
this
debate
was
being
carried
on
i
went
to
bargain
for
three
horses
which
i
wanted
on
my
travels
and
he
took
care
that
a
secret
watch
should
be
kept
over
my
proceedings
for
he
had
vast
authority
in
padua
wherefore
when
i
proposed
to
pay
for
the
horses
which
were
to
cost
five
hundred
ducats
their
owner
answered
artist
i
make
you
a
present
of
the
three
i
replied
is
not
you
who
give
them
me
and
from
the
generous
donor
i
can
not
accept
them
seeing
i
have
been
unable
to
present
him
with
any
specimen
of
my
the
good
fellow
said
that
if
i
did
not
take
them
i
should
get
no
other
horses
in
padua
and
should
have
to
make
my
journey
on
foot
upon
that
i
returned
to
the
magnificent
messer
pietro
who
affected
to
be
ignorant
of
the
affair
and
only
begged
me
with
marks
of
kindness
to
remain
in
padua
this
was
contrary
to
my
intention
for
i
had
quite
resolved
to
set
out
therefore
i
had
to
accept
the
three
horses
and
with
them
we
began
our
journey
note
he
left
rome
april
note
i
need
hardly
say
that
this
is
the
bembo
who
ruled
over
italian
literature
like
a
dictator
from
the
reign
of
leo
onwards
he
was
of
a
noble
venetian
house
paul
iii
made
him
cardinal
in
he
died
aged
in
xcv
i
chose
the
route
through
the
grisons
all
other
passes
being
unsafe
on
account
of
war
we
crossed
the
mountains
of
the
alba
and
berlina
it
was
the
of
may
and
the
snow
upon
them
lay
in
masses
at
the
utmost
hazard
of
our
lives
we
succeeded
in
surmounting
those
two
alpine
ridges
and
when
they
had
been
traversed
we
stopped
at
a
place
which
if
i
remember
rightly
is
called
valdista
there
we
took
up
quarters
and
at
nightfall
there
arrived
a
florentine
courier
named
busbacca
i
had
heard
him
mentioned
as
a
man
of
character
and
able
in
his
profession
but
i
did
not
know
that
he
had
forfeited
that
reputation
by
his
rogueries
when
he
saw
me
in
the
hostelry
he
addressed
me
by
my
name
said
he
was
going
on
business
of
importance
to
lyons
and
entreated
met
to
lend
him
money
for
the
journey
i
said
i
had
no
money
to
lend
but
that
if
he
liked
to
join
me
i
would
pay
his
expenses
as
far
as
lyons
the
rascal
wept
and
wheedled
me
with
a
long
story
saying
a
poor
courier
employed
on
affairs
of
national
consequence
has
fallen
short
of
money
it
is
the
duty
of
a
man
like
you
to
assist
then
he
added
that
he
was
carrying
things
of
the
utmost
importance
from
messer
filippo
strozzi
and
showing
me
a
leather
case
for
a
cup
he
had
with
him
whispered
in
my
ear
that
it
held
a
goblet
of
silver
which
contained
jewels
to
the
value
of
many
thousands
of
ducats
together
with
letters
of
vast
consequence
sent
by
messer
filippo
strozzi
i
told
him
that
he
ought
to
let
me
conceal
the
jewels
about
his
own
person
which
would
be
much
less
dangerous
than
carrying
them
in
the
goblet
he
might
give
that
up
to
me
and
its
value
being
probably
about
ten
crowns
i
would
supply
him
with
on
the
security
to
these
words
the
courier
replied
that
he
would
go
with
me
since
he
could
not
do
otherwise
for
to
give
up
the
goblet
would
not
be
to
his
honour
accordingly
we
struck
the
bargain
so
and
taking
horse
next
morning
came
to
a
lake
between
valdistate
and
vessa
it
is
fifteen
miles
long
when
one
reaches
vessa
on
beholding
the
boats
upon
that
lake
i
took
fright
because
they
are
of
pine
of
no
great
size
and
no
great
thickness
loosely
put
together
and
not
even
pitched
if
i
had
not
seen
four
german
gentlemen
with
their
four
horses
embarking
in
one
of
the
same
sort
as
ours
i
should
never
have
set
my
foot
in
it
indeed
i
should
far
more
likely
have
turned
tail
but
when
i
saw
their
recklessness
i
took
it
into
my
head
that
those
german
waters
would
not
drown
folk
as
ours
do
in
italy
however
my
two
young
men
kept
saying
to
me
it
is
surely
dangerous
to
embark
in
this
craft
with
four
i
replied
cowards
do
you
not
observe
how
those
four
gentlemen
have
taken
boat
before
us
and
are
going
on
their
way
with
laughter
if
this
were
wine
as
indeed
water
i
should
say
that
they
were
going
gladly
to
drown
themselves
in
it
but
as
it
is
but
water
i
know
well
that
they
have
no
more
pleasure
than
we
have
in
drowning
the
lake
was
fifteen
miles
long
and
about
three
broad
on
one
side
rose
a
mountain
very
tall
and
cavernous
on
the
other
some
flat
land
and
grassy
when
we
had
gone
about
four
miles
it
began
to
storm
upon
the
lake
and
our
oarsmen
asked
us
to
help
in
rowing
this
we
did
awhile
i
made
gestures
and
directed
them
to
land
us
on
the
farther
shore
they
said
it
was
not
possible
because
there
was
not
depth
of
water
for
the
boat
and
there
were
shoals
there
which
would
make
it
go
to
pieces
and
drown
us
all
and
still
they
kept
on
urging
us
to
help
them
the
boatmen
shouted
one
to
the
other
calling
for
assistance
when
i
saw
them
thus
dismayed
my
horse
being
an
intelligent
animal
i
arranged
the
bridle
on
his
neck
and
took
the
end
of
the
halter
with
my
left
hand
the
horse
like
most
of
his
kind
being
not
devoid
of
reason
seemed
to
have
an
instinct
of
my
intention
for
having
turned
his
face
towards
the
fresh
grass
i
meant
that
he
should
swim
and
draw
me
after
him
just
at
that
moment
a
great
wave
broke
over
the
boat
ascanio
shrieked
out
my
father
save
me
and
wanted
to
throw
himself
upon
my
neck
accordingly
i
laid
hand
to
my
little
dagger
and
told
them
to
do
as
i
had
shown
them
seeing
that
the
horses
would
save
their
lives
as
well
as
i
too
hoped
to
escape
with
mine
by
the
same
means
but
that
if
he
tried
to
jump
on
me
i
should
kill
him
so
we
went
forward
several
miles
in
this
great
peril
of
our
lives
note
i
have
retained
spelling
of
names
upon
this
journey
he
passed
the
bernina
and
albula
mountains
descended
the
valley
of
the
rhine
to
wallenstadt
travelled
by
weesen
and
probably
glarus
to
lachen
and
zurich
thence
to
solothurn
lausanne
geneva
lyons
note
filippo
strozzi
was
leader
of
the
party
now
in
exile
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
duke
cosimo
on
the
of
august
in
this
year
xcvi
when
we
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
lake
we
found
a
little
bit
of
level
ground
where
we
could
land
and
i
saw
that
those
four
german
gentlemen
had
already
come
to
shore
there
but
on
our
wishing
to
disembark
the
boatmen
would
hear
nothing
of
it
then
i
said
to
my
young
men
is
the
time
to
show
what
stuff
we
are
made
of
so
draw
your
swords
and
force
these
fellows
to
put
us
on
this
we
did
not
however
without
difficulty
for
they
offered
a
stubborn
resistance
when
at
last
we
got
to
land
we
had
to
climb
that
mountain
for
two
miles
and
it
was
more
troublesome
than
getting
up
a
ladder
i
was
completely
clothed
in
mail
with
big
boots
and
a
gun
in
my
hand
and
it
was
raining
as
though
the
fountains
of
the
heavens
were
opened
those
devils
the
german
gentlemen
leading
their
little
horses
by
the
bridle
accomplished
miracles
of
agility
but
our
animals
were
not
up
to
the
business
and
we
burst
with
the
fatigue
of
making
them
ascend
that
hill
of
difficulty
we
had
climbed
a
little
way
when
horse
an
excellent
beast
of
hungarian
race
made
a
false
step
he
was
going
a
few
paces
before
the
courier
busbacca
to
whom
ascanio
had
given
his
lance
to
carry
for
him
well
the
path
was
so
bad
that
the
horse
stumbled
and
went
on
scrambling
backwards
without
being
able
to
regain
his
footing
till
he
stuck
upon
the
point
of
the
lance
which
that
rogue
of
a
courier
had
not
the
wit
to
keep
out
of
his
way
the
weapon
passed
right
through
his
throat
and
when
my
other
workman
went
to
help
him
his
horse
also
a
animal
slipped
towards
the
lake
and
held
on
by
some
shrub
which
offered
but
a
slight
support
this
horse
was
carrying
a
pair
of
which
contained
all
my
money
and
other
valuables
i
cried
out
to
the
young
man
to
save
his
own
life
and
let
the
horse
go
to
the
devil
the
fall
was
more
than
a
mile
of
precipitous
descent
above
the
waters
of
the
lake
just
below
the
place
our
boatmen
had
taken
up
their
station
so
that
if
the
horse
fell
he
would
have
come
precisely
on
them
i
was
ahead
of
the
whole
company
and
we
waited
to
see
the
horse
plunge
headlong
it
seemed
certain
that
he
must
go
to
perdition
during
this
i
said
to
my
young
men
under
no
concern
let
us
save
our
lives
and
give
thanks
to
god
for
all
that
happens
i
am
only
distressed
for
that
poor
fellow
busbacca
who
tied
his
goblet
and
his
jewels
to
the
value
of
several
thousands
of
ducats
on
the
thinking
that
the
safest
place
my
things
are
but
a
few
hundred
crowns
and
i
am
in
no
fear
whatever
if
only
i
get
then
busbacca
cried
out
am
not
sorry
for
my
own
loss
but
for
said
i
to
him
you
sorry
for
my
trifles
and
not
for
all
that
property
of
yours
he
answered
will
tell
you
in
name
in
these
circumstances
and
at
the
point
of
peril
we
have
reached
truth
must
be
spoken
i
know
that
yours
are
crowns
and
are
so
in
good
sooth
but
that
case
in
which
i
said
i
had
so
many
jewels
and
other
lies
is
all
full
of
on
hearing
this
i
could
not
hold
from
laughing
my
young
men
laughed
too
and
he
began
to
cry
the
horse
extricated
itself
by
a
great
effort
when
we
had
given
it
up
for
lost
so
then
still
laughing
we
summoned
our
forces
and
bent
ourselves
to
making
the
ascent
the
four
german
gentlemen
having
gained
the
top
before
us
sent
down
some
folk
who
gave
us
aid
thus
at
length
we
reached
our
lodging
in
the
wilderness
here
being
wet
to
the
skin
tired
out
and
famished
we
were
most
agreeably
entertained
we
dried
ourselves
took
rest
and
satisfied
our
hunger
while
certain
wild
herbs
were
applied
to
the
wounded
horse
they
pointed
out
to
us
the
plant
in
question
of
which
the
hedges
were
full
and
we
were
told
that
if
the
wound
was
kept
continually
plugged
with
its
leaves
the
beast
would
not
only
recover
but
would
serve
us
just
as
if
it
had
sustained
no
injury
we
proceeded
to
do
as
they
advised
then
having
thanked
those
gentlemen
and
feeling
ourselves
entirely
refreshed
we
quitted
the
place
and
travelled
onwards
thanking
god
for
saving
us
from
such
great
perils
xcvii
we
reached
a
town
beyond
vessa
where
we
passed
the
night
and
heard
a
watchman
through
all
the
hours
singing
very
agreeably
for
all
the
houses
of
that
city
being
built
of
pine
wood
it
was
the
only
business
to
warn
folk
against
fire
nerves
had
been
quite
shaken
by
the
adventures
accordingly
each
hour
when
the
watchman
sang
he
called
out
in
his
sleep
god
i
am
drowning
that
was
because
of
the
fright
he
had
had
and
besides
he
had
got
drunk
in
the
evening
because
he
would
sit
boozing
with
all
the
germans
who
were
and
sometimes
he
cried
am
burning
and
sometimes
am
drowning
and
at
other
times
he
thought
he
was
in
hell
and
tortured
with
that
caviare
suspended
round
his
throat
this
night
was
so
amusing
that
it
turned
all
our
troubles
into
laughter
in
the
morning
we
rose
with
very
fine
weather
and
went
to
dine
in
a
smiling
little
place
called
lacca
here
we
obtained
excellent
entertainment
and
then
engaged
guides
who
were
returning
to
a
town
called
surich
the
guide
who
attended
us
went
along
the
dyked
bank
of
a
lake
there
was
no
other
road
and
the
dyke
itself
was
covered
with
water
so
that
the
reckless
fellow
slipped
and
fell
together
with
his
horse
beneath
the
water
i
who
was
but
a
few
steps
behind
him
stopped
my
horse
and
waited
to
see
the
donkey
get
out
of
the
water
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
he
began
to
sing
again
and
made
signs
to
me
to
follow
i
broke
away
upon
the
right
hand
and
got
through
some
hedges
making
my
young
men
and
busbacca
take
that
way
the
guide
shouted
in
german
that
if
the
folk
of
those
parts
saw
me
they
would
put
me
to
death
however
we
passed
forward
and
escaped
that
other
storm
so
we
arrived
at
surich
a
marvellous
city
bright
and
polished
like
a
little
gem
there
we
rested
a
whole
day
then
left
betimes
one
morning
and
reached
another
fair
city
called
solutorno
thence
we
came
to
usanna
from
usanna
to
ginevra
from
ginevra
to
lione
always
singing
and
laughing
at
lione
i
rested
four
days
and
had
much
pleasant
intercourse
with
some
of
my
friends
there
i
was
also
repaid
what
i
had
spent
upon
busbacca
afterwards
i
set
out
upon
the
road
to
paris
this
was
a
delightful
journey
except
that
when
we
reached
palissa
a
band
of
venturers
tried
to
murder
us
and
it
was
only
by
great
courage
and
address
that
we
got
free
from
them
from
that
point
onward
we
travelled
to
paris
without
the
least
trouble
in
the
world
always
singing
and
laughing
we
arrived
safely
at
our
destination
note
la
palice
note
cellini
in
the
narrative
of
his
second
french
journey
explains
that
these
were
a
notable
crew
of
very
daring
brigands
in
the
lyonese
province
xcviii
after
taking
some
repose
in
paris
i
went
to
visit
the
painter
rosso
who
was
in
the
service
i
thought
to
find
in
him
one
of
the
sincerest
friends
i
had
in
the
world
seeing
that
in
rome
i
had
done
him
the
greatest
benefits
which
one
man
can
confer
upon
another
as
these
may
be
described
briefly
i
will
not
here
omit
their
mention
in
order
to
expose
the
shamelessness
of
such
ingratitude
while
he
was
in
rome
then
being
a
man
given
to
he
spoke
so
ill
of
raffaello
da
works
that
the
pupils
of
the
latter
were
quite
resolved
to
murder
him
from
this
peril
i
saved
him
by
keeping
a
close
watch
upon
him
day
and
night
again
the
evil
things
said
by
rosso
against
san
gallo
that
excellent
architect
caused
the
latter
to
get
work
taken
from
him
which
he
had
previously
procured
for
him
from
messer
agnolo
da
cesi
and
after
this
san
gallo
used
his
influence
so
strenuously
against
him
that
he
must
have
been
brought
to
the
verge
of
starvation
had
not
i
pitied
his
condition
and
lent
him
some
scores
of
crowns
to
live
upon
so
then
not
having
been
repaid
and
knowing
that
he
held
employment
under
the
king
i
went
as
i
have
said
to
look
him
up
i
did
not
merely
expect
him
to
discharge
his
debt
but
also
to
show
me
favour
and
assist
in
placing
me
in
that
great
service
when
rosso
set
eyes
on
me
his
countenance
changed
suddenly
and
he
exclaimed
you
have
taken
this
long
journey
at
great
charges
to
your
loss
especially
at
this
present
time
when
all
thoughts
are
occupied
with
war
and
not
with
the
bagatelles
of
our
i
replied
that
i
had
brought
money
enough
to
take
me
back
to
rome
as
i
had
come
to
paris
and
that
this
was
not
the
proper
return
for
the
pains
i
had
endured
for
him
and
that
now
i
began
to
believe
what
maestro
antonio
da
san
gallo
said
of
him
when
he
tried
to
turn
the
matter
into
jest
on
this
exposure
of
his
baseness
i
showed
him
a
letter
of
exchange
for
five
hundred
crowns
upon
ricciardo
del
bene
then
the
rascal
was
ashamed
and
wanted
to
detain
me
almost
by
force
but
i
laughed
at
him
and
took
my
leave
in
the
company
of
a
painter
whom
i
found
there
this
man
was
called
sguazzella
he
too
was
a
florentine
and
i
went
to
lodge
in
his
house
with
three
horses
and
three
servants
at
so
much
per
week
he
treated
me
very
well
and
was
even
better
paid
by
me
in
return
afterwards
i
sought
audience
of
the
king
through
the
introduction
of
his
treasurer
messer
giuliano
buonaccorti
i
met
however
with
considerable
delays
owing
as
i
did
not
then
know
to
the
strenuous
exertions
rosso
made
against
my
admission
to
his
majesty
when
messer
giuliano
became
aware
of
this
he
took
me
down
at
once
to
fontana
bilio
and
brought
me
into
the
presence
of
the
king
who
granted
me
a
whole
hour
of
very
gracious
audience
since
he
was
then
on
the
point
of
setting
out
for
lyons
he
told
messer
giuliano
to
take
me
with
him
adding
that
on
the
journey
we
could
discuss
some
works
of
art
his
majesty
had
it
in
his
head
to
execute
accordingly
i
followed
the
court
and
on
the
way
i
entered
into
close
relations
with
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
who
had
not
at
that
period
obtained
the
hat
every
evening
i
used
to
hold
long
conversations
with
the
cardinal
in
the
course
of
which
his
lordship
advised
me
to
remain
at
an
abbey
of
his
in
lyons
and
there
to
abide
at
ease
until
the
king
returned
from
this
campaign
adding
that
he
was
going
on
to
grenoble
and
that
i
should
enjoy
every
convenience
in
the
abbey
when
we
reached
lyons
i
was
already
ill
and
my
lad
ascanio
had
taken
a
quartan
fever
the
french
and
their
court
were
both
grown
irksome
to
me
and
i
counted
the
hours
till
i
could
find
myself
again
in
rome
on
seeing
my
anxiety
to
return
home
the
cardinal
gave
me
money
sufficient
for
making
him
a
silver
bason
and
jug
so
we
took
good
horses
and
set
our
faces
in
the
direction
of
rome
passing
the
simplon
and
travelling
for
some
while
in
the
company
of
certain
frenchmen
ascanio
troubled
by
his
quartan
and
i
by
a
slow
fever
which
i
found
it
quite
impossible
to
throw
off
i
had
moreover
got
my
stomach
out
of
order
to
such
an
extent
that
for
the
space
of
four
months
as
i
verily
believe
i
hardly
ate
one
whole
loaf
of
bread
in
the
week
and
great
was
my
longing
to
reach
italy
being
desirous
to
die

ippolito

of

archbishop
of
milan
at
the
age
of
fifteen
cardinal
in
spent
a
large
part
of
his
life
in
france
xcix
when
we
had
crossed
the
mountains
of
the
simplon
we
came
to
a
river
near
a
place
called
indevedro
it
was
broad
and
very
deep
spanned
by
a
long
narrow
bridge
without
ramparts
that
morning
a
thick
white
frost
had
fallen
and
when
i
reached
the
bridge
riding
before
the
rest
i
recognised
how
dangerous
it
was
and
bade
my
servants
and
young
men
dismount
and
lead
their
horses
so
i
got
across
without
accident
and
rode
on
talking
with
one
of
the
frenchmen
whose
condition
was
that
of
a
gentleman
the
other
who
was
a
scrivener
lagged
a
little
way
behind
jeering
the
french
gentleman
and
me
because
we
had
been
so
frightened
by
nothing
at
all
as
to
give
ourselves
the
trouble
of
walking
i
turned
round
and
seeing
him
upon
the
middle
of
the
bridge
begged
him
to
come
gently
since
the
place
was
very
dangerous
the
fellow
true
to
his
french
nature
cried
out
in
french
that
i
was
a
man
of
poor
spirit
and
that
there
was
no
danger
whatsoever
while
he
spoke
these
words
and
urged
his
horse
forward
the
animal
suddenly
slipped
over
the
bridge
and
fell
with
legs
in
air
close
to
a
huge
rock
there
was
there
now
god
is
very
often
merciful
to
madmen
so
the
two
beasts
human
and
equine
plunged
together
into
a
deep
wide
pool
where
both
of
them
went
down
below
the
water
on
seeing
what
had
happened
i
set
off
running
at
full
speed
scrambled
with
much
difficulty
on
to
the
rock
and
dangling
over
from
it
seized
the
skirt
of
the
gown
and
pulled
him
up
for
he
was
still
submerged
beneath
the
surface
he
had
drunk
his
bellyful
of
water
and
was
within
an
ace
of
being
drowned
i
then
beholding
him
out
of
danger
congratulated
the
man
upon
my
having
been
the
means
of
rescuing
his
life
the
fellow
to
this
answered
me
in
french
that
i
had
done
nothing
the
important
things
to
save
were
his
writings
worth
many
scores
of
crowns
and
these
words
he
seemed
to
say
in
anger
dripping
wet
and
spluttering
the
while
thereupon
i
turned
round
to
our
guides
and
ordered
them
to
help
the
brute
adding
that
i
would
see
them
paid
one
of
them
with
great
address
and
trouble
set
himself
to
the
business
and
picked
up
all
the
writings
so
that
he
lost
not
one
of
them
the
other
guide
refused
to
trouble
himself
by
rendering
any
assistance
i
ought
here
to
say
that
we
had
made
a
purse
up
and
that
i
performed
the
part
of
paymaster
so
when
we
reached
the
place
i
mentioned
and
had
dined
i
drew
some
coins
from
the
common
purse
and
gave
them
to
the
guide
who
helped
to
draw
him
from
the
water
thereupon
the
fellow
called
out
that
i
might
pay
them
out
of
my
own
pocket
he
had
no
intention
of
giving
the
man
more
than
what
had
been
agreed
on
for
his
services
as
guide
upon
this
i
retorted
with
insulting
language
then
the
other
guide
who
had
done
nothing
came
up
and
demanded
to
be
rewarded
also
i
told
him
that
the
one
who
had
borne
the
cross
deserved
the
recompense
he
cried
out
that
he
would
presently
show
me
a
cross
which
should
make
me
repent
i
replied
that
i
would
light
a
candle
at
that
cross
which
should
i
hoped
make
him
to
be
the
first
to
weep
his
folly
the
village
we
were
in
lay
on
the
frontier
between
venice
and
the
germans
so
the
guide
ran
off
to
bring
the
folk
together
and
came
followed
by
a
crowd
with
a
in
his
hand
mounted
on
my
good
steed
i
lowered
the
barrel
of
my
arquebuse
and
turning
to
my
comrades
cried
the
first
shot
i
shall
bring
that
fellow
down
do
you
likewise
your
duty
for
these
are
highway
robbers
who
have
used
this
little
incident
to
contrive
our
the
innkeeper
at
whose
house
we
had
dined
called
one
of
the
leaders
an
imposing
old
man
and
begged
him
to
put
a
stop
to
the
disorder
saying
is
a
most
courageous
young
man
you
may
cut
him
to
pieces
but
he
will
certainly
kill
a
lot
of
you
and
perhaps
will
escape
your
hands
after
doing
all
the
mischief
he
is
so
matters
calmed
down
and
the
old
man
their
leader
said
to
me
in
peace
you
would
not
have
much
to
boast
of
against
us
even
if
you
had
a
hundred
men
to
back
i
recognised
the
truth
of
his
words
and
had
indeed
made
up
my
mind
to
die
among
them
therefore
when
no
further
insults
were
cast
at
me
i
shook
my
head
and
exclaimed
should
certainly
have
done
my
utmost
to
prove
i
am
no
statue
but
a
man
of
flesh
and
then
we
resumed
our
journey
and
that
evening
at
the
first
lodging
we
came
to
settled
our
accounts
together
there
i
parted
for
ever
from
that
beast
of
a
frenchman
remaining
on
very
friendly
terms
with
the
other
who
was
a
gentleman
afterwards
i
reached
ferrara
with
my
three
horses
and
no
other
company
having
dismounted
i
went
to
court
in
order
to
pay
my
reverence
to
the
duke
and
gain
permission
to
depart
next
morning
for
loreto
when
i
had
waited
until
two
hours
after
nightfall
his
excellency
appeared
i
kissed
his
hands
he
received
me
with
much
courtesy
and
ordered
that
water
should
be
brought
for
me
to
wash
my
hands
before
eating
to
this
compliment
i
made
a
pleasant
answer
excellent
lord
it
is
now
more
than
four
months
that
i
have
eaten
only
just
enough
to
keep
life
together
knowing
therefore
that
i
could
not
enjoy
the
delicacies
of
your
royal
table
i
will
stay
and
talk
with
you
while
your
excellency
is
supping
in
this
way
we
shall
both
have
more
pleasure
than
if
i
were
to
sup
with
accordingly
we
entered
into
conversation
and
prolonged
it
for
the
next
three
hours
at
that
time
i
took
my
leave
and
when
i
got
back
to
the
inn
found
a
most
excellent
meal
ready
for
the
duke
had
sent
me
the
plates
from
his
own
banquet
together
with
some
famous
wine
having
now
fasted
two
full
hours
beyond
my
usual
hour
for
supping
i
fell
to
with
hearty
appetite
and
this
was
the
first
time
since
four
months
that
i
felt
the
power
or
will
to
eat
note
probably
the
doveria
in
the
valdivedro
c
leaving
ferrara
in
the
morning
i
went
to
santa
maria
at
loreto
and
thence
having
performed
my
devotions
pursued
the
journey
to
rome
there
i
found
my
most
faithful
felice
to
whom
i
abandoned
my
old
shop
with
all
its
furniture
and
appurtenances
and
opened
another
much
larger
and
roomier
next
to
sugherello
the
perfumer
i
thought
for
certain
that
the
great
king
francis
would
not
have
remembered
me
therefore
i
accepted
commissions
from
several
noblemen
and
in
the
meanwhile
began
the
bason
and
jug
ordered
by
the
cardinal
ferrara
i
had
a
crowd
of
workmen
and
many
large
affairs
on
hand
in
gold
and
silver
now
the
arrangement
i
had
made
with
that
perugian
workman
was
that
he
should
write
down
all
the
monies
which
had
been
disbursed
on
his
account
chiefly
for
clothes
and
divers
other
sundries
and
these
together
with
the
costs
of
travelling
amounted
to
about
seventy
crowns
we
agreed
that
he
should
discharge
the
debt
by
monthly
payments
of
three
crowns
and
this
he
was
well
able
to
do
since
he
gained
more
than
eight
through
me
at
the
end
of
two
months
the
rascal
decamped
from
my
shop
leaving
me
in
the
lurch
with
a
mass
of
business
on
my
hands
and
saying
that
he
did
not
mean
to
pay
me
a
farthing
more
i
was
resolved
to
seek
redress
but
allowed
myself
to
be
persuaded
to
do
so
by
the
way
of
justice
at
first
i
thought
of
lopping
off
an
arm
of
his
and
assuredly
i
should
have
done
so
if
my
friends
had
not
told
me
that
it
was
a
mistake
seeing
i
should
lose
my
money
and
perhaps
rome
too
a
second
time
forasmuch
as
blows
can
not
be
measured
and
that
with
the
agreement
i
held
of
his
i
could
at
any
moment
have
him
taken
up
i
listened
to
their
advice
though
i
should
have
liked
to
conduct
the
affair
more
freely
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
sued
him
before
the
auditor
of
the
camera
and
gained
by
suit
in
consequence
of
that
decree
for
which
i
waited
several
months
i
had
him
thrown
into
prison
at
the
same
time
i
was
overwhelmed
with
large
commissions
among
others
i
had
to
supply
all
the
ornaments
of
gold
and
jewels
for
the
wife
of
signor
gierolimo
orsino
father
of
signor
paolo
who
is
now
the
of
our
duke
cosimo
these
things
i
had
nearly
finished
yet
others
of
the
greatest
consequence
were
always
coming
in
i
employed
eight
and
worked
day
and
night
together
with
them
for
the
sake
alike
of
honour
and
of
gain

accoramboni
see
my
in
italy
vol
vi
ci
while
i
was
engaged
in
prosecuting
my
affairs
with
so
much
vigour
there
arrived
a
letter
sent
to
me
by
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
which
ran
as
follows
our
dear
friend
these
last
days
the
most
christian
king
here
made
mention
of
you
and
said
that
he
should
like
to
have
you
in
his
service
whereto
i
answered
that
you
had
promised
me
whenever
i
sent
for
you
to
serve
his
majesty
that
you
would
come
at
once
his
majesty
then
answered
is
my
will
that
provision
for
his
journey
according
to
his
merits
should
be
sent
him
and
immediately
ordered
his
admiral
to
make
me
out
an
order
for
one
thousand
golden
crowns
upon
the
treasurer
of
the
exchequer
the
cardinal
gaddi
who
was
present
at
this
conversation
advanced
immediately
and
told
his
majesty
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
make
these
dispositions
seeing
that
he
had
sent
you
money
enough
and
that
you
were
already
on
the
journey
if
then
as
i
think
probable
the
facts
are
quite
contrary
to
those
assertions
of
cardinal
gaddi
reply
to
me
without
delay
upon
the
receipt
of
this
letter
for
i
will
undertake
to
gather
up
the
fallen
thread
and
have
the
promised
money
given
you
by
this
magnanimous
now
let
the
world
take
notice
and
all
the
folk
that
dwell
on
it
what
power
malignant
stars
with
adverse
fortune
exercise
upon
us
human
beings
i
had
not
spoken
twice
in
my
lifetime
to
that
little
simpleton
of
a
cardinal
gaddi
nor
do
i
think
that
he
meant
by
this
bumptiousness
of
his
to
do
me
any
harm
but
only
through
lightheadedness
and
senseless
folly
to
make
it
seem
as
though
he
also
held
the
affairs
of
artists
whom
the
king
was
wanting
under
his
own
personal
supervision
just
as
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
did
but
afterwards
he
was
so
stupid
as
not
to
tell
me
anything
at
all
about
the
matter
elsewise
it
is
certain
that
my
wish
to
shield
a
silly
mannikin
from
reproach
if
only
for
our
sake
would
have
made
me
find
out
some
excuse
to
mend
the
bungling
of
his
foolish
immediately
upon
the
receipt
of
cardinal
letter
i
answered
that
about
cardinal
gaddi
i
knew
absolutely
nothing
and
that
even
if
he
had
made
overtures
of
that
kind
to
me
i
should
not
have
left
italy
without
informing
his
most
reverend
lordship
i
also
said
that
i
had
more
to
do
in
rome
than
at
any
previous
time
but
that
if
his
most
christian
majesty
made
sign
of
wanting
me
one
word
of
his
communicated
by
so
great
a
prince
as
his
most
reverend
lordship
would
suffice
to
make
me
set
off
upon
the
spot
leaving
all
other
concerns
to
take
their
chance
after
i
had
sent
my
letter
that
traitor
the
perugian
workman
devised
a
piece
of
malice
against
me
which
succeeded
at
once
owing
to
the
avarice
of
pope
paolo
da
farnese
but
also
far
more
to
that
of
his
bastard
who
was
then
called
duke
of
castro
the
fellow
in
question
informed
one
of
signor
pier
secretaries
that
having
been
with
me
as
workman
several
years
he
was
acquainted
with
all
my
affairs
on
the
strength
of
which
he
gave
his
word
to
signor
pier
luigi
that
i
was
worth
more
than
eighty
thousand
ducats
and
that
the
greater
part
of
this
property
consisted
in
jewels
which
jewels
belonged
to
the
church
and
that
i
had
stolen
them
in
castel
angelo
during
the
sack
of
rome
and
that
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
catch
me
on
the
spot
with
secrecy
it
so
happened
that
i
had
been
at
work
one
morning
more
than
three
hours
before
daybreak
upon
the
trousseau
of
the
bride
i
mentioned
then
while
my
shop
was
being
opened
and
swept
out
i
put
my
cape
on
to
go
abroad
and
take
the
air
directing
my
steps
along
the
strada
giulia
i
turned
into
chiavica
and
at
this
corner
crespino
the
bargello
with
all
his
constables
made
up
to
me
and
said
are
the
i
answered
you
have
mistaken
your
said
crespino
are
the
artist
benvenuto
and
i
know
you
well
and
i
have
to
take
you
to
the
castle
of
angelo
where
lords
go
and
men
of
accomplishments
your
upon
that
four
of
his
rushed
on
me
and
would
have
seized
by
force
a
dagger
which
i
wore
and
some
rings
i
carried
on
my
finger
but
crespino
rebuked
them
a
man
of
you
shall
touch
him
it
is
quite
enough
if
you
perform
your
duty
and
see
that
he
does
not
escape
then
he
came
up
and
begged
me
with
words
of
courtesy
to
surrender
my
arms
while
i
was
engaged
in
doing
this
it
crossed
my
mind
that
exactly
on
that
very
spot
i
had
assassinated
pompeo
they
took
me
straightway
to
castle
and
locked
me
in
an
upper
chamber
in
the
keep
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
ever
smelt
a
prison
up
to
the
age
i
then
had
of
years
note
he
had
been
invested
with
the
duchy
of
castro
in
cii
signor
pier
luigi
the
son
had
well
considered
the
large
sum
for
which
i
stood
accused
so
he
begged
the
reversion
of
it
from
his
most
holy
father
and
asked
that
he
might
have
the
money
made
out
to
himself
the
pope
granted
this
willingly
adding
that
he
would
assist
in
its
recovery
consequently
after
having
kept
me
eight
whole
days
in
prison
they
sent
me
up
for
examination
in
order
to
put
an
end
if
possible
to
the
affair
i
was
summoned
into
one
of
the
great
halls
of
the
papal
castle
a
place
of
much
dignity
my
examiners
were
first
the
governor
of
rome
called
messer
benedetto
conversini
of
pistoja
who
afterwards
became
bishop
of
jesi
secondly
the
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
and
thirdly
the
judge
in
criminal
cases
messer
benedetto
da
cagli
these
three
men
began
at
first
to
question
me
in
gentle
terms
which
afterwards
they
changed
to
words
of
considerable
harshness
and
menace
apparently
because
i
said
to
them
lords
it
is
more
than
now
since
you
have
been
pestering
me
with
questions
about
fables
and
such
things
so
that
one
may
truly
say
you
are
chattering
or
prattling
by
chattering
i
mean
talking
without
reason
by
prattling
i
mean
talking
nonsense
therefore
i
beg
you
to
tell
me
what
it
really
is
you
want
of
me
and
to
let
me
hear
from
your
lips
reasonable
speech
and
not
jabberings
or
in
reply
to
these
words
of
mine
the
governor
who
was
a
pistojan
could
no
longer
disguise
his
furious
temper
and
began
talk
very
confidently
or
rather
far
too
arrogantly
but
let
me
tell
you
that
i
will
bring
your
pride
down
lower
than
a
spaniel
by
the
words
of
reason
you
shall
hear
from
me
these
will
be
neither
jabberings
nor
nonsense
as
you
have
it
but
shall
form
a
chain
of
arguments
to
answer
which
you
will
be
forced
to
tax
the
utmost
of
your
wits
then
he
began
to
speak
as
follows
know
for
certain
that
you
were
in
rome
at
the
time
when
this
unhappy
city
was
subject
to
the
calamity
of
the
sack
at
that
time
you
were
in
this
castle
of
angelo
and
were
employed
as
bombardier
now
since
you
are
a
jeweller
and
goldsmith
by
trade
pope
clement
being
previously
acquainted
with
you
and
having
by
him
no
one
else
of
your
profession
called
you
into
his
secret
counsels
and
made
you
unset
all
the
jewels
of
his
tiaras
mitres
and
rings
afterwards
having
confidence
in
you
he
ordered
you
to
sew
them
into
his
clothes
while
thus
engaged
you
sequestered
unknown
to
his
holiness
a
portion
of
them
to
the
value
of
eighty
thousand
crowns
this
has
been
told
us
by
one
of
your
workmen
to
whom
you
disclosed
the
matter
in
your
braggadocio
way
now
we
tell
you
frankly
that
you
must
find
the
jewels
or
their
value
in
money
after
that
we
will
release
note
bishop
of
forlimpopoli
in
and
of
jesi
in
note
benedetto
valenti
ciii
when
i
heard
these
words
i
could
not
hold
from
bursting
into
a
great
roar
of
laughter
then
having
laughed
a
while
i
said
be
to
that
god
on
this
first
occasion
when
it
has
pleased
his
divine
majesty
to
imprison
me
i
should
not
be
imprisoned
for
some
folly
as
the
wont
is
usually
with
young
men
if
what
you
say
were
the
truth
i
run
no
risk
of
having
to
submit
to
corporal
punishment
since
the
authority
of
the
law
was
suspended
during
that
season
indeed
i
could
excuse
myself
by
saying
that
like
a
faithful
servant
i
had
kept
back
treasure
to
that
amount
for
the
sacred
and
holy
apostolic
church
waiting
till
i
could
restore
it
to
a
good
pope
or
else
to
those
who
might
require
it
of
me
as
for
instance
you
might
if
this
were
verily
the
when
i
had
spoken
so
far
the
furious
governor
would
not
let
me
conclude
my
argument
but
exclaimed
in
a
burst
of
rage
the
affair
as
you
like
best
benvenuto
it
is
enough
for
us
to
have
found
the
property
which
we
had
lost
be
quick
about
it
if
you
do
not
want
us
to
use
other
measures
than
then
they
began
to
rise
and
leave
the
chamber
but
i
stopped
them
crying
out
lords
my
examination
is
not
over
bring
that
to
an
end
and
go
then
where
you
they
resumed
their
seats
in
a
very
angry
temper
making
as
though
they
did
not
mean
to
listen
to
a
word
i
said
and
at
the
same
time
half
relieved
as
though
they
had
discovered
all
they
wanted
to
know
i
then
began
my
speech
to
this
effect
are
to
know
my
lords
that
it
is
now
some
twenty
years
since
i
first
came
to
rome
and
i
have
never
been
sent
to
prison
here
or
on
this
that
catchpole
of
a
governor
called
out
yet
you
have
killed
men
enough
here
i
replied
is
you
that
say
it
and
not
i
but
if
some
one
came
to
kill
you
priest
as
you
are
you
would
defend
yourself
and
if
you
killed
him
the
sanctity
of
law
would
hold
you
justified
therefore
let
me
continue
my
defence
if
you
wish
to
report
the
case
to
the
pope
and
to
judge
me
fairly
once
more
i
tell
you
that
i
have
been
a
sojourner
in
this
marvellous
city
rome
for
nigh
on
twenty
years
and
here
i
have
exercised
my
art
in
matters
of
vast
importance
knowing
that
this
is
the
seat
of
christ
i
entertained
the
reasonable
belief
that
when
some
temporal
prince
sought
to
inflict
on
me
a
mortal
injury
i
might
have
recourse
to
this
holy
chair
and
to
this
vicar
of
christ
in
confidence
that
he
would
surely
uphold
my
cause
ah
me
whither
am
i
now
to
go
what
prince
is
there
who
will
protect
me
from
this
infamous
assassination
was
it
not
your
business
before
you
took
me
up
to
find
out
what
i
had
done
with
those
eighty
thousand
ducats
was
it
not
your
duty
to
inspect
the
record
of
the
jewels
which
have
been
carefully
inscribed
by
this
apostolic
camera
through
the
last
five
hundred
years
if
you
had
discovered
anything
missing
on
that
record
then
you
ought
to
have
seized
all
my
books
together
with
myself
i
tell
you
for
a
certainty
that
the
registers
on
which
are
written
all
the
jewels
of
the
pope
and
the
regalia
must
be
perfectly
in
order
you
will
not
find
there
missing
a
single
article
of
value
which
belonged
to
pope
clement
that
has
not
been
minutely
noted
the
one
thing
of
the
kind
which
occurs
to
me
is
this
when
that
poor
man
pope
clement
wanted
to
make
terms
with
those
thieves
of
the
imperial
army
who
had
robbed
rome
and
insulted
the
church
a
certain
cesare
iscatinaro
if
i
rightly
remember
his
name
came
to
negotiate
with
him
and
having
nearly
concluded
the
agreement
the
pope
in
his
extremity
to
show
the
man
some
mark
of
favour
let
fall
a
diamond
from
his
finger
which
was
worth
about
four
thousand
crowns
and
when
iscatinaro
stooped
to
pick
it
up
the
pope
told
him
to
keep
it
for
his
sake
i
was
present
at
these
transactions
and
if
the
diamond
of
which
i
speak
be
missing
i
have
told
you
where
it
went
but
i
have
the
firmest
conviction
that
you
will
find
even
this
noted
upon
the
register
after
this
you
may
blush
at
your
leisure
for
having
done
such
cruel
injustice
to
a
man
like
me
who
has
performed
so
many
honourable
services
for
the
apostolic
chair
i
would
have
you
know
that
but
for
me
the
morning
when
the
imperial
troops
entered
the
borgo
they
would
without
let
or
hindrance
have
forced
their
way
into
the
castle
it
was
i
who
unrewarded
for
this
act
betook
myself
with
vigour
to
the
guns
which
had
been
abandoned
by
the
cannoneers
and
soldiers
of
the
ordnance
i
put
spirit
into
my
comrade
raffaello
da
montelupo
the
sculptor
who
had
also
left
his
post
and
hid
himself
all
frightened
in
a
corner
without
stirring
foot
or
finger
i
woke
his
courage
up
and
he
and
i
alone
together
slew
so
many
of
the
enemies
that
the
soldiers
took
another
road
i
it
was
who
shot
at
iscatinaro
when
i
saw
him
talking
to
pope
clement
without
the
slightest
mark
of
reverence
nay
with
the
most
revolting
insolence
like
the
lutheran
and
infidel
he
was
pope
clement
upon
this
had
the
castle
searched
to
find
and
hang
the
man
who
did
it
i
it
was
who
wounded
the
prince
of
orange
in
the
head
down
there
below
the
trenches
of
the
castle
then
too
how
many
ornaments
of
silver
gold
and
jewels
how
many
models
and
coins
so
beautiful
and
so
esteemed
have
i
not
made
for
holy
church
is
this
then
the
presumptuous
priestly
recompense
you
give
a
man
who
has
served
and
loved
you
with
such
loyalty
with
such
mastery
of
art
oh
go
and
report
the
whole
that
i
have
spoken
to
the
pope
go
and
tell
him
that
his
jewels
are
all
in
his
possession
that
i
never
received
from
the
church
anything
but
wounds
and
stonings
at
that
epoch
of
the
sack
that
i
never
reckoned
upon
any
gain
beyond
some
small
remuneration
from
pope
paolo
which
he
had
promised
me
now
at
last
i
know
what
to
think
of
his
holiness
and
you
his
while
i
was
delivering
this
speech
they
sat
and
listened
in
astonishment
then
exchanging
glances
one
with
the
other
and
making
signs
of
much
surprise
they
left
me
all
three
went
together
to
report
what
i
had
spoken
to
the
pope
the
pope
felt
some
shame
and
gave
orders
that
all
the
records
of
the
jewels
should
be
diligently
searched
when
they
had
ascertained
that
none
were
missing
they
left
me
in
the
castle
without
saying
a
word
more
about
it
signor
pier
luigi
felt
also
that
he
had
acted
ill
and
to
end
the
affair
they
set
about
to
contrive
my
death
note
it
may
mean
from
their
seats
note
gio
bartolommeo
di
gattinara
raffaello
da
montelupo
in
his
autobiography
calls
him
cattinaro
and
relates
how
he
came
one
day
into
the
castle
to
negotiate
a
treaty
he
was
wounded
in
the
arm
by
one
of
our
this
confirms
what
follows
above
civ
during
the
agitations
of
this
time
which
i
have
just
related
king
francis
received
news
of
how
the
pope
was
keeping
me
in
prison
and
with
what
injustice
he
had
sent
a
certain
gentleman
of
his
named
monsignor
di
morluc
as
his
ambassador
to
rome
to
him
therefore
he
now
wrote
claiming
me
from
the
pope
as
the
man
of
his
majesty
the
pope
was
a
person
of
extraordinary
sense
and
ability
but
in
this
affair
of
mine
he
behaved
weakly
and
unintelligently
for
he
made
answer
to
the
envoy
that
his
majesty
need
pay
me
no
attention
since
i
was
a
fellow
who
gave
much
trouble
by
fighting
therefore
he
advised
his
majesty
to
leave
me
alone
adding
that
he
kept
me
in
prison
for
homicides
and
other
deviltries
which
i
had
played
to
this
the
king
sent
answer
that
justice
in
his
realm
was
excellently
maintained
for
even
as
his
majesty
was
wont
to
shower
rewards
and
favours
upon
men
of
parts
and
virtue
so
did
he
ever
chastise
the
troublesome
his
holiness
had
let
me
go
not
caring
for
the
service
of
the
said
benvenuto
and
the
king
when
he
saw
him
in
his
realm
most
willingly
adopted
him
therefore
he
now
asked
for
him
in
the
quality
of
his
own
man
such
a
demand
was
certainly
one
of
the
most
honourable
marks
of
favour
which
a
man
of
my
sort
could
desire
yet
it
proved
the
source
of
infinite
annoyance
and
hurt
to
me
the
pope
was
roused
to
such
fury
by
the
jealous
fear
he
had
lest
i
should
go
and
tell
the
whole
world
how
infamously
i
had
been
treated
that
he
kept
revolving
ways
in
which
i
might
be
put
to
death
without
injury
to
his
own
credit
the
castellan
of
angelo
was
one
of
our
florentines
called
messer
giorgio
a
knight
of
the
ugolini
family
this
worthy
man
showed
me
the
greatest
courtesy
and
let
me
go
free
about
the
castle
on
parole
he
was
well
aware
how
greatly
i
had
been
wronged
and
when
i
wanted
to
give
security
for
leave
to
walk
about
the
castle
he
replied
that
though
he
could
not
take
that
seeing
the
pope
set
too
much
importance
upon
my
affair
yet
he
would
frankly
trust
my
word
because
he
was
informed
by
every
one
what
a
worthy
man
i
was
so
i
passed
my
parole
and
he
granted
me
conveniences
for
working
at
my
trade
i
then
reflecting
that
the
anger
against
me
must
subside
as
well
because
of
my
innocence
as
because
of
the
favour
shown
me
by
the
king
kept
my
shop
in
rome
open
while
ascanio
my
prentice
came
to
the
castle
and
brought
me
things
to
work
at
i
could
not
indeed
do
much
feeling
myself
imprisoned
so
unjustly
yet
i
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
bore
my
adverse
fortune
with
as
light
a
heart
as
i
was
able
i
had
secured
the
attachment
of
all
the
guards
and
many
soldiers
of
the
castle
now
the
pope
used
to
come
at
times
to
sup
there
and
on
those
occasions
no
watch
was
kept
but
the
place
stood
open
like
an
ordinary
palace
consequently
while
the
pope
was
there
the
prisoners
used
to
be
shut
up
with
great
precautions
none
such
however
were
taken
with
me
who
had
the
license
to
go
where
i
liked
even
at
those
times
about
it
precincts
often
then
those
soldiers
told
me
that
i
ought
to
escape
and
that
they
would
aid
and
abet
me
knowing
as
they
did
how
greatly
i
had
been
wronged
i
answered
that
i
had
given
my
parole
to
the
castellan
who
was
such
a
worthy
man
and
had
done
me
such
kind
offices
one
very
brave
and
clever
soldier
used
to
say
to
me
benvenuto
you
must
know
that
a
prisoner
is
not
obliged
and
can
not
be
obliged
to
keep
faith
any
more
than
aught
else
which
befits
a
free
man
do
what
i
tell
you
escape
from
that
rascal
of
a
pope
and
that
bastard
his
son
for
both
are
bent
on
having
your
life
by
i
had
however
made
my
mind
up
rather
to
lose
my
life
than
to
break
the
promise
i
had
given
that
good
man
the
castellan
so
i
bore
the
extreme
discomforts
of
my
situation
and
had
for
companion
of
misery
a
friar
of
the
palavisina
house
who
was
a
very
famous
preacher
note
jean
de
montluc
brother
of
the
celebrated
marshal
bishop
of
valence
a
friend
of
margaret
of
navarre
and
like
her
a
protector
of
the
huguenots
he
negotiated
the
election
of
the
duke
of
anjou
to
the
throne
of
poland
note
it
is
only
known
of
this
man
that
he
was
a
knight
of
jerusalem
and
had
been
commendatore
of
prato
in
note
cellini
means
pallavicini
nothing
seems
to
be
known
about
him
except
that
his
imprisonment
is
mentioned
in
a
letter
of
under
date
cv
this
man
had
been
arrested
as
a
lutheran
he
was
an
excellent
companion
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
religion
i
found
him
the
biggest
scoundrel
in
the
world
to
whom
all
kinds
of
vices
were
acceptable
his
fine
intellectual
qualities
won
my
admiration
but
i
hated
his
dirty
vices
and
frankly
taxed
him
with
them
this
friar
kept
perpetually
reminding
me
that
i
was
in
no
wise
bound
to
observe
faith
with
the
castellan
since
i
had
become
a
prisoner
i
replied
to
these
arguments
that
he
might
be
speaking
the
truth
as
a
friar
but
that
as
a
man
he
spoke
the
contrary
for
every
one
who
called
himself
a
man
and
not
a
monk
was
bound
to
keep
his
word
under
all
circumstances
in
which
he
chanced
to
be
i
therefore
being
a
man
and
not
a
monk
was
not
going
to
break
the
simple
and
loyal
word
which
i
had
given
seeing
then
that
he
could
not
sap
my
honour
by
the
subtle
and
ingenious
sophistries
he
so
eloquently
developed
the
friar
hit
upon
another
way
of
tempting
me
he
allowed
some
days
to
pass
during
which
he
read
me
the
sermons
of
fra
jerolimo
savonarola
and
these
he
expounded
with
such
lucidity
and
learning
that
his
comment
was
even
finer
than
the
text
i
remained
in
ecstasies
of
admiration
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
i
would
not
have
done
for
him
except
as
i
have
said
to
break
my
promised
word
when
he
saw
the
effect
his
talents
had
produced
upon
my
mind
he
thought
of
yet
another
method
cautiously
he
began
to
ask
what
means
i
should
have
taken
supposing
my
jailers
had
locked
me
up
in
order
to
set
the
dungeon
doors
open
and
effect
my
flight
i
then
who
wanted
to
display
the
sharpness
of
my
own
wits
to
so
ingenious
a
man
replied
that
i
was
quite
sure
of
being
able
to
open
the
most
baffling
locks
and
bars
far
more
those
of
our
prison
to
do
which
would
be
the
same
to
me
as
eating
a
bit
of
new
cheese
in
order
then
to
gain
my
secret
the
friar
now
made
light
of
these
assertions
averring
that
persons
who
have
gained
some
credit
by
their
abilities
are
wont
to
talk
big
of
things
which
if
they
had
to
put
their
boasts
in
action
would
speedily
discredit
them
and
much
to
their
dishonour
himself
had
heard
me
speak
so
far
from
the
truth
that
he
was
inclined
to
think
i
should
when
pushed
to
proof
end
in
a
dishonourable
failure
upon
this
feeling
myself
stung
to
the
quick
by
that
devil
of
a
friar
i
responded
that
i
always
made
a
practice
of
promising
in
words
less
than
i
could
perform
in
deeds
what
i
had
said
about
the
keys
was
the
merest
trifle
in
a
few
words
i
could
make
him
understand
that
the
matter
was
as
i
had
told
it
then
all
too
heedlessly
i
demonstrated
the
facility
with
which
my
assertions
could
be
carried
into
act
he
affected
to
pay
little
attention
but
all
the
same
he
learned
my
lesson
well
by
heart
with
keen
intelligence
as
i
have
said
above
the
worthy
castellan
let
me
roam
at
pleasure
over
the
whole
fortress
not
even
at
night
did
he
lock
me
in
as
was
the
custom
with
the
other
prisoners
moreover
he
allowed
me
to
employ
myself
as
i
liked
best
with
gold
or
silver
or
with
wax
according
to
my
whim
so
then
i
laboured
several
weeks
at
the
bason
ordered
by
cardinal
ferrara
but
the
irksomeness
of
my
imprisonment
bred
in
me
a
disgust
for
such
employment
and
i
took
to
modelling
in
wax
some
little
figures
of
my
fancy
for
mere
recreation
of
the
wax
which
i
used
the
friar
stole
a
piece
and
with
this
he
proceeded
to
get
false
keys
made
upon
the
method
i
had
heedlessly
revealed
to
him
he
had
chosen
for
his
accomplice
a
registrar
named
luigi
a
paduan
who
was
in
the
service
when
the
keys
were
ordered
the
locksmith
revealed
their
plot
and
the
castellan
who
came
at
times
to
see
me
in
my
chamber
noticing
the
wax
which
i
was
using
recognised
it
at
once
and
exclaimed
is
true
that
this
poor
fellow
benvenuto
has
suffered
a
most
grievous
wrong
yet
he
ought
not
to
have
dealt
thus
with
me
for
i
have
ever
strained
my
sense
of
right
to
show
him
kindness
now
i
shall
keep
him
straitly
under
lock
and
key
and
shall
take
good
care
to
do
him
no
more
accordingly
he
had
me
shut
up
with
disagreeable
circumstances
among
the
worst
of
which
were
the
words
flung
at
me
by
some
of
his
devoted
servants
who
were
indeed
extremely
fond
of
me
but
now
on
this
occasion
cast
in
my
teeth
all
the
kind
offices
the
castellan
had
done
me
they
came
in
fact
to
calling
me
ungrateful
light
and
disloyal
one
of
them
in
particular
used
those
injurious
terms
more
insolently
than
was
decent
whereupon
i
being
convinced
of
my
innocence
retorted
hotly
that
i
had
never
broken
faith
and
would
maintain
these
words
at
the
peril
of
my
life
and
that
if
he
or
any
of
his
fellows
abused
me
so
unjustly
i
would
fling
the
lie
back
in
his
throat
the
man
intolerant
of
my
rebuke
rushed
to
the
room
and
brought
me
the
wax
with
the
model
of
the
keys
no
sooner
had
i
seen
the
wax
than
i
told
him
that
both
he
and
i
were
in
the
right
but
i
begged
him
to
procure
for
me
an
audience
with
the
castellan
for
i
meant
to
explain
frankly
how
the
matter
stood
which
was
of
far
more
consequence
than
they
imagined
the
castellan
sent
for
me
at
once
and
i
told
him
the
whole
course
of
events
this
made
him
arrest
the
friar
who
betrayed
the
registrar
and
the
alter
ran
a
risk
of
being
hanged
however
the
castellan
hushed
the
affair
up
although
it
had
reached
the
ears
he
saved
his
registrar
from
the
gallows
and
gave
me
the
same
freedom
as
i
had
before
cvi
when
i
saw
how
rigorously
this
affair
was
prosecuted
i
began
to
think
of
my
own
concerns
and
said
another
of
these
storms
should
rise
and
the
man
should
lose
confidence
in
me
i
should
then
be
under
no
obligation
to
him
and
might
wish
to
use
my
wits
a
little
which
would
certainly
work
their
end
better
than
those
of
that
rascally
so
i
began
to
have
new
sheets
of
a
coarse
fabric
brought
me
and
did
not
send
the
dirty
ones
away
when
my
servants
asked
for
them
i
bade
them
hold
their
tongues
saying
i
had
given
the
sheets
to
some
of
those
poor
soldiers
and
if
the
matter
came
to
knowledge
the
wretched
fellows
ran
risk
of
the
galleys
this
made
my
young
men
and
attendants
especially
felice
keep
the
secret
of
the
sheets
in
all
loyalty
i
meanwhile
set
myself
to
emptying
a
straw
mattress
the
stuffing
of
which
i
burned
having
a
chimney
in
my
prison
out
of
the
sheets
i
cut
strips
the
third
of
a
cubit
in
breadth
and
when
i
had
made
enough
in
my
opinion
to
clear
the
great
height
of
the
central
keep
of
angelo
i
told
my
servants
that
i
had
given
away
what
i
wanted
they
must
now
bring
me
others
of
a
finer
fabric
and
i
would
always
send
back
the
dirty
ones
this
affair
was
presently
forgotten
now
my
workpeople
and
were
obliged
to
close
my
shop
at
the
order
of
the
cardinals
santi
quattro
and
cornaro
who
told
me
openly
that
the
pope
would
not
hear
of
setting
me
at
large
and
that
the
great
favours
shown
me
by
king
francis
had
done
far
more
harm
that
good
it
seems
that
the
last
words
spoken
from
the
king
by
monsignor
di
morluc
had
been
to
this
effect
namely
that
the
pope
ought
to
hand
me
over
to
the
ordinary
judges
of
the
court
if
i
had
done
wrong
he
could
chastise
me
but
otherwise
it
was
but
reason
that
he
should
set
me
at
liberty
this
message
so
irritated
the
pope
that
he
made
his
mind
up
to
keep
me
a
prisoner
for
life
at
the
same
time
the
castellan
most
certainly
did
his
utmost
to
assist
me
when
my
enemies
perceived
that
my
shop
was
closed
they
lost
no
opportunity
of
taunting
and
reviling
those
servants
and
friends
of
mine
who
came
to
visit
me
in
prison
it
happened
on
one
occasion
that
ascanio
who
came
twice
a
day
to
visit
me
asked
to
have
a
jacket
cut
out
for
him
from
a
blue
silk
vest
of
mine
i
never
used
i
had
only
worn
it
once
on
the
occasion
when
i
walked
in
procession
i
replied
that
these
were
not
the
times
nor
was
i
in
the
place
to
wear
such
clothes
the
young
man
took
my
refusal
of
this
miserable
vest
so
ill
that
he
told
me
he
wanted
to
go
home
to
tagliacozzo
all
in
a
rage
i
answered
that
he
could
not
please
me
better
than
by
taking
himself
off
and
he
swore
with
passion
that
he
would
never
show
his
face
to
me
again
when
these
words
passed
between
us
we
were
walking
round
the
keep
of
the
castle
it
happened
that
the
castellan
was
also
taking
the
air
there
so
just
when
we
met
his
lordship
ascanio
said
am
going
away
farewell
for
ever
i
added
ever
is
my
wish
too
and
thus
in
sooth
shall
it
be
i
shall
tell
the
sentinels
not
to
let
you
pass
again
then
turning
to
the
castellan
i
begged
him
with
all
my
heart
to
order
the
guards
to
keep
ascanio
out
adding
little
peasant
comes
here
to
add
to
my
great
trouble
i
entreat
you
therefore
my
lord
not
to
let
him
enter
any
the
castellan
was
much
grieved
because
he
knew
him
to
be
a
lad
of
marvellous
talents
he
was
moreover
so
fair
a
person
that
every
one
who
once
set
eyes
on
him
seemed
bound
to
love
him
beyond
measure
the
boy
went
away
weeping
that
day
he
had
with
him
a
small
scimitar
which
it
was
at
times
his
wont
to
carry
hidden
beneath
his
clothes
leaving
the
castle
then
and
having
his
face
wet
with
tears
he
chanced
to
meet
two
of
my
chief
enemies
jeronimo
the
perugian
and
a
certain
michele
goldsmiths
both
of
them
michele
being
friend
and
enemy
called
out
is
ascanio
crying
for
perhaps
his
father
is
dead
i
mean
that
father
in
the
castle
ascanio
answered
on
the
instant
is
alive
but
you
shall
die
this
then
raising
his
hand
he
struck
two
blows
with
the
scimitar
both
at
the
head
the
first
felled
him
to
earth
the
second
lopped
three
fingers
off
his
right
hand
though
it
was
aimed
at
his
head
he
lay
there
like
a
dead
man
the
matter
was
at
once
reported
to
the
pope
who
cried
in
a
great
fury
the
king
wants
him
to
be
tried
go
and
give
him
three
days
to
prepare
his
defence
so
they
came
and
executed
the
commission
which
the
pope
had
given
them
the
excellent
castellan
went
off
upon
the
spot
to
his
holiness
and
informed
him
that
i
was
no
accomplice
in
the
matter
and
that
i
had
sent
ascanio
about
his
business
so
ably
did
he
plead
my
cause
that
he
saved
my
life
from
this
impending
tempest
ascanio
meanwhile
escaped
to
tagliacozzo
to
his
home
there
whence
he
wrote
begging
a
thousand
times
my
pardon
and
acknowledging
his
wrong
in
adding
troubles
to
my
grave
disaster
but
protesting
that
if
through
grace
i
came
out
from
the
prison
he
meant
never
to
abandon
me
i
let
him
understand
that
he
must
mind
his
art
and
that
if
god
set
me
a
large
again
i
would
certainly
recall
him

the
castellan
was
subject
to
a
certain
sickness
which
came
upon
him
every
year
and
deprived
him
of
his
wits
the
sign
of
its
approach
was
that
he
kept
continually
talking
or
rather
jabbering
to
no
purpose
these
humours
took
a
different
shape
each
year
one
time
he
thought
he
was
an
oiljar
another
time
he
thought
he
was
a
frog
and
hopped
about
as
frogs
do
another
time
he
thought
he
was
dead
and
then
they
had
to
bury
him
not
a
year
passed
but
he
got
some
such
hypochondriac
notions
into
his
head
at
this
season
he
imagined
that
he
was
a
bat
and
when
he
went
abroad
to
take
the
air
he
used
to
scream
like
bats
in
a
high
thin
tone
and
then
he
would
flap
his
hands
and
body
as
though
he
were
about
to
fly
the
doctors
when
they
saw
the
fit
coming
on
him
and
his
old
servants
gave
him
all
the
distractions
they
could
think
of
and
since
they
had
noticed
that
he
derived
much
pleasure
from
my
conversation
they
were
always
fetching
me
to
keep
him
company
at
times
the
poor
man
detained
me
for
four
or
five
stricken
hours
without
ever
letting
me
cease
talking
he
used
to
keep
me
at
his
table
eating
opposite
to
him
and
never
stopped
chatting
and
making
me
chat
but
during
those
discourses
i
contrived
to
make
a
good
meal
he
poor
man
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
so
that
at
last
he
wore
me
out
i
was
at
the
end
of
my
strength
and
sometimes
when
i
looked
at
him
i
noticed
that
his
eyeballs
were
rolling
in
a
frightful
manner
one
looking
one
way
and
the
other
in
another
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
ask
me
whether
i
had
ever
had
a
fancy
to
fly
i
answered
that
it
had
always
been
my
ambition
to
do
those
things
which
offer
the
greatest
difficulties
to
men
and
that
i
had
done
them
as
to
flying
the
god
of
nature
had
gifted
me
with
a
body
well
suited
for
running
and
leaping
far
beyond
the
common
average
and
that
with
the
talents
i
possessed
for
manual
art
i
felt
sure
i
had
the
courage
to
try
flying
he
then
inquired
what
methods
i
should
use
to
which
i
answered
that
taking
into
consideration
all
flying
creatures
and
wishing
to
imitate
by
art
what
they
derived
from
nature
none
was
so
apt
a
model
as
the
bat
no
sooner
had
the
poor
man
heard
the
name
bat
which
recalled
the
humour
he
was
suffering
under
than
he
cried
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
says
says
true
the
the
the
thing
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
if
one
gave
you
the
opportunity
should
you
have
the
heart
to
fly
i
said
if
he
would
set
me
at
liberty
i
felt
quite
up
to
flying
down
to
prati
after
making
myself
a
pair
of
wings
out
of
waxed
linen
thereupon
he
replied
too
should
be
prepared
to
take
flight
but
since
the
pope
has
bidden
me
guard
you
as
though
you
were
his
own
eyes
and
i
know
you
a
clever
devil
who
would
certainly
escape
i
shall
now
have
you
locked
up
with
a
hundred
keys
in
order
to
prevent
you
slipping
through
my
i
then
began
to
implore
him
and
remind
him
that
i
might
have
fled
but
that
on
account
of
the
word
which
i
had
given
him
i
would
never
have
betrayed
his
trust
therefore
i
begged
him
for
the
love
of
god
and
by
the
kindness
he
had
always
shown
me
not
to
add
greater
evils
to
the
misery
of
my
present
situation
while
i
was
pouring
out
these
entreaties
he
gave
strict
orders
to
have
me
bound
and
taken
and
locked
up
in
prison
on
seeing
that
it
could
not
be
helped
i
told
him
before
all
his
servants
me
well
up
and
keep
good
watch
on
me
for
i
shall
certainly
contrive
to
so
they
took
and
confined
me
with
the
utmost
care
cviii
i
then
began
to
deliberate
upon
the
best
way
of
making
my
escape
no
sooner
had
i
been
locked
in
than
i
went
about
exploring
my
prison
and
when
i
thought
i
had
discovered
how
to
get
out
of
it
i
pondered
the
means
of
descending
from
the
lofty
keep
for
so
the
great
round
central
tower
is
called
i
took
those
new
sheets
of
mine
which
as
i
have
said
already
i
had
cut
in
strips
and
sewn
together
then
i
reckoned
up
the
quantity
which
would
be
sufficient
for
my
purpose
having
made
this
estimate
and
put
all
things
in
order
i
looked
out
a
pair
of
pincers
which
i
had
abstracted
from
a
savoyard
belonging
to
the
guard
of
the
castle
this
man
superintended
the
casks
and
cisterns
he
also
amused
himself
with
carpentering
now
he
possessed
several
pairs
of
pincers
among
which
was
one
both
big
and
heavy
i
then
thinking
it
would
suit
my
purpose
took
it
and
hid
it
in
my
straw
mattress
the
time
had
now
come
for
me
to
use
it
so
i
began
to
try
the
nails
which
kept
the
hinges
of
my
door
in
place
the
door
was
double
and
the
clinching
of
the
nails
could
not
be
seen
so
that
when
i
attempted
to
draw
one
out
i
met
with
the
greatest
trouble
in
the
end
however
i
succeeded
when
i
had
drawn
the
first
nail
i
bethought
me
how
to
prevent
its
being
noticed
for
this
purpose
i
mixed
some
rust
which
i
had
scraped
from
old
iron
with
a
little
wax
obtaining
exactly
the
same
colour
as
the
heads
of
the
long
nails
which
i
had
extracted
then
i
set
myself
to
counterfeit
these
heads
and
place
them
on
the
holdfasts
for
each
nail
i
extracted
i
made
a
counterfeit
in
wax
i
left
the
hinges
attached
to
their
at
top
and
bottom
by
means
of
some
of
the
same
nails
that
i
had
drawn
but
i
took
care
to
cut
these
and
replace
them
lightly
so
that
they
only
just
supported
the
irons
of
the
hinges
all
this
i
performed
with
the
greatest
difficulty
because
the
castellan
kept
dreaming
every
night
that
i
had
escaped
which
made
him
send
from
time
to
time
to
inspect
my
prison
the
man
who
came
had
the
title
and
behaviour
of
a
he
was
called
bozza
and
used
always
to
bring
with
him
another
of
the
same
sort
named
giovanni
and
nicknamed
pedignone
the
latter
was
a
soldier
and
bozza
a
giovanni
never
entered
my
prison
without
saying
something
offensive
to
me
he
came
from
the
district
of
prato
and
had
been
an
apothecary
in
the
town
there
every
evening
he
minutely
examined
the
holdfasts
of
the
hinges
and
the
whole
chamber
and
i
used
to
say
a
good
watch
over
me
for
i
am
resolved
by
all
means
to
these
words
bred
a
great
enmity
between
him
and
me
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
use
precautions
to
conceal
my
tools
that
is
to
say
my
pincers
and
a
great
big
poniard
and
other
appurtenances
all
these
i
put
away
together
in
my
mattress
where
i
also
kept
the
strips
of
linen
i
had
made
when
day
broke
i
used
immediately
to
sweep
my
room
out
and
though
i
am
by
nature
a
lover
of
cleanliness
at
that
time
i
kept
myself
unusually
spick
and
span
after
sweeping
up
i
made
my
bed
as
daintily
as
i
could
laying
flowers
upon
it
which
a
savoyard
used
to
bring
me
nearly
every
morning
he
had
the
care
of
the
cistern
and
the
casks
and
also
amused
himself
with
carpentering
it
was
from
him
i
stole
the
pincers
which
i
used
in
order
to
draw
out
the
nails
from
the
holdfasts
of
the
hinges
note
the
door
seems
to
have
been
hung
upon
hinges
with
plates
nailed
into
the
posts
cellini
calls
these
plates
cix
well
to
return
to
the
subject
of
my
bed
when
bozza
and
pedignone
came
i
always
told
them
to
give
it
a
wide
berth
so
as
not
to
dirty
and
spoil
it
for
me
now
and
then
just
to
irritate
me
they
would
touch
it
lightly
upon
which
i
cried
dirty
cowards
lay
my
hand
on
one
of
your
swords
there
and
will
do
you
a
mischief
that
will
make
you
wonder
do
you
think
you
are
fit
to
touch
the
bed
of
a
man
like
me
when
i
chastise
you
i
shall
not
heed
my
own
life
for
i
am
certain
to
take
yours
let
me
alone
then
with
my
troubles
and
my
tribulations
and
give
me
more
annoyance
than
i
have
already
if
not
i
shall
make
you
see
what
a
desperate
man
is
able
to
these
words
they
reported
to
the
castellan
who
gave
them
express
orders
never
to
go
near
my
bed
and
when
they
came
to
me
to
come
without
swords
but
for
the
rest
to
keep
a
watchful
guard
upon
me
having
thus
secured
my
bed
from
meddlers
i
felt
as
though
the
main
point
was
gained
for
there
lay
all
things
needful
to
my
venture
it
happened
on
the
evening
of
a
certain
that
the
castellan
was
seriously
indisposed
his
humours
grew
extravagant
he
kept
repeating
that
he
was
a
bat
and
if
they
heard
that
benvenuto
had
flown
away
they
must
let
him
go
to
catch
me
up
since
he
could
fly
by
night
most
certainly
as
well
or
better
than
myself
for
it
was
thus
he
argued
is
a
counterfeit
bat
but
i
am
a
real
one
and
since
he
is
committed
to
my
care
leave
me
to
act
i
shall
be
sure
to
catch
he
had
passed
several
nights
in
this
frenzy
and
had
worn
out
all
his
servants
whereof
i
received
full
information
through
divers
channels
but
especially
from
the
savoyard
who
was
my
friend
at
heart
on
the
evening
of
that
then
i
made
my
mind
up
to
escape
come
what
might
and
first
i
prayed
most
devoutly
to
god
imploring
his
divine
majesty
to
protect
and
succour
me
in
that
so
perilous
a
venture
afterwards
i
set
to
work
at
all
the
things
i
needed
and
laboured
the
whole
of
the
night
it
was
two
hours
before
daybreak
when
at
last
i
removed
those
hinges
with
the
greatest
toil
but
the
wooden
panel
itself
and
the
bolt
too
offered
such
resistance
that
i
could
not
open
the
door
so
i
had
to
cut
into
the
wood
yet
in
the
end
i
got
it
open
and
shouldering
the
strips
of
linen
which
i
had
rolled
up
like
bundles
of
flax
upon
two
sticks
i
went
forth
and
directed
my
steps
towards
the
latrines
of
the
keep
spying
from
within
two
tiles
upon
the
roof
i
was
able
at
once
to
clamber
up
with
ease
i
wore
a
white
doublet
with
a
pair
of
white
hose
and
a
pair
of
half
boots
into
which
i
had
stuck
the
poniard
i
have
mentioned
after
scaling
the
roof
i
took
one
end
of
my
linen
roll
and
attached
it
to
a
piece
of
antique
tile
which
was
built
into
the
fortress
wall
it
happened
to
jut
out
scarcely
four
fingers
in
order
to
fix
the
band
i
gave
it
the
form
of
a
stirrup
when
i
had
attached
it
to
that
piece
of
tile
i
turned
to
god
and
said
god
give
aid
to
my
good
cause
you
know
that
it
is
good
you
see
that
i
am
aiding
then
i
let
myself
go
gently
by
degrees
supporting
myself
with
the
sinews
of
my
arms
until
i
touched
the
ground
there
was
no
moonshine
but
the
light
of
a
fair
open
heaven
when
i
stood
upon
my
feet
on
solid
earth
i
looked
up
at
the
vast
height
which
i
had
descended
with
such
spirit
and
went
gladly
away
thinking
i
was
free
but
this
was
not
the
case
for
the
castellan
on
that
side
of
the
fortress
had
built
two
lofty
walls
the
space
between
which
he
used
for
stable
and
henyard
the
place
was
barred
with
thick
iron
bolts
outside
i
was
terribly
disgusted
to
find
there
was
no
exit
from
this
trap
but
while
i
paced
up
and
down
debating
what
to
do
i
stumbled
on
a
long
pole
which
was
covered
up
with
straw
not
without
great
trouble
i
succeeded
in
placing
it
against
the
wall
and
then
swarmed
up
it
by
the
force
of
my
arms
until
i
reached
the
top
but
since
the
wall
ended
in
a
sharp
ridge
i
had
not
strength
enough
to
drag
the
pole
up
after
me
accordingly
i
made
my
mind
up
to
use
a
portion
of
the
second
roll
of
linen
which
i
had
there
the
other
was
left
hanging
from
the
keep
of
the
castle
so
i
cut
a
piece
off
tied
it
to
the
pole
and
clambered
down
the
wall
enduring
the
utmost
toil
and
fatigue
i
was
quite
exhausted
and
had
moreover
flayed
the
inside
of
my
hands
which
bled
freely
this
compelled
me
to
rest
awhile
and
i
bathed
my
hands
in
my
own
urine
when
i
thought
that
my
strength
was
recovered
i
advanced
quickly
toward
the
last
rampart
which
faces
toward
prati
there
i
put
my
bundle
of
linen
lines
down
upon
the
ground
meaning
to
fasten
them
round
a
battlement
and
descend
the
lesser
as
i
had
the
greater
height
but
no
sooner
had
i
placed
the
linen
than
i
became
aware
behind
me
of
a
sentinel
who
was
going
the
rounds
seeing
my
designs
interrupted
and
my
life
in
peril
i
resolved
to
face
the
guard
this
fellow
when
he
noticed
my
bold
front
and
that
i
was
marching
on
him
with
weapon
in
hand
quickened
his
pace
and
gave
me
a
wide
berth
i
had
left
my
lines
some
little
way
behind
so
i
turned
with
hasty
steps
to
regain
them
and
though
i
came
within
sight
of
another
sentinel
he
seemed
as
though
he
did
not
choose
to
take
notice
of
me
having
found
my
lines
and
attached
them
to
the
battlement
i
let
myself
go
on
the
descent
whether
it
was
that
i
thought
i
had
really
come
to
earth
and
relaxed
my
grasp
to
jump
or
whether
my
hands
were
so
tired
that
they
could
not
keep
their
hold
at
any
rate
i
fell
struck
my
head
in
falling
and
lay
stunned
for
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
so
far
as
i
could
judge
it
was
just
upon
daybreak
when
the
fresh
breeze
which
blows
an
hour
before
the
sun
revived
me
yet
i
did
not
immediately
recover
my
senses
for
i
thought
my
head
had
been
cut
off
and
fancied
that
i
was
in
purgatory
with
time
little
by
little
my
faculties
returned
and
i
perceived
that
i
was
outside
the
castle
and
in
a
flash
remembered
all
my
adventures
i
was
aware
of
the
wound
in
my
head
before
i
knew
my
leg
was
broken
for
i
put
my
hands
up
and
withdrew
them
covered
with
blood
then
i
searched
the
spot
well
and
judged
and
ascertained
that
i
had
sustained
no
injury
of
consequence
there
but
when
i
wanted
to
stand
up
i
discovered
that
my
right
leg
was
broken
three
inches
above
the
heel
not
even
this
dismayed
me
i
drew
forth
my
poniard
with
its
scabbard
the
latter
had
a
metal
point
ending
in
a
large
ball
which
had
caused
the
fracture
of
my
leg
for
the
bone
coming
into
violent
contact
with
the
ball
and
not
being
able
to
bend
had
snapped
at
that
point
i
threw
the
sheath
away
and
with
the
poniard
cut
a
piece
of
the
linen
which
i
had
left
then
i
bound
my
leg
up
as
well
as
i
could
and
crawled
on
all
fours
with
the
poniard
in
my
hand
toward
the
city
gate
when
i
reached
it
i
found
it
shut
but
i
noticed
a
stone
just
beneath
the
door
which
did
not
appear
to
be
very
firmly
fixed
this
i
attempted
to
dislodge
after
setting
my
hands
to
it
and
feeling
it
move
it
easily
gave
way
and
i
drew
it
out
through
the
gap
thus
made
i
crept
into
the
town
cx
i
had
crawled
more
than
five
hundred
paces
from
the
place
where
i
fell
to
the
gate
by
which
i
entered
no
sooner
had
i
got
inside
than
some
mastiff
dogs
set
upon
me
and
bit
me
badly
when
they
returned
to
the
attack
and
worried
me
i
drew
my
poniard
and
wounded
one
of
them
so
sharply
that
he
howled
aloud
and
all
the
dogs
according
to
their
nature
ran
after
him
i
meanwhile
made
the
best
way
i
could
on
all
fours
toward
the
church
of
the
trespontina
on
arriving
at
the
opening
of
the
street
which
leads
to
agnolo
i
turned
off
in
the
direction
of
san
piero
and
now
the
dawn
had
risen
over
me
and
i
felt
myself
in
danger
when
therefore
i
chanced
to
meet
a
driving
his
donkey
laden
with
full
buckets
i
called
the
fellow
and
begged
him
to
carry
me
upon
his
back
to
the
terrace
by
the
steps
of
san
piero
adding
am
an
unfortunate
young
man
who
while
escaping
from
a
window
in
a
have
fallen
and
broken
my
leg
the
place
from
which
i
made
my
exit
is
one
of
great
importance
and
if
i
am
discovered
i
run
risk
of
being
cut
to
pieces
so
for
sake
lift
me
quickly
and
i
will
give
you
a
crown
of
saying
this
i
clapped
my
hand
to
my
purse
where
i
had
a
good
quantity
he
took
me
up
at
once
hitched
me
on
his
back
and
carried
me
to
the
raised
terrace
by
the
steps
to
san
piero
there
i
bade
him
leave
me
saying
he
must
run
back
to
his
donkey
i
resumed
my
march
crawling
always
on
all
fours
and
making
for
the
palace
of
the
duchess
wife
of
duke
ottavio
and
daughter
of
the
emperor
she
was
his
natural
child
and
had
been
married
to
duke
alessandro
i
chose
her
house
for
refuge
because
i
was
quite
certain
that
many
of
my
friends
who
had
come
with
that
great
princess
from
florence
were
tarrying
there
also
because
she
had
taken
me
into
favour
through
something
which
the
castellan
had
said
in
my
behalf
wishing
to
be
of
service
to
me
he
told
the
pope
that
i
had
saved
the
city
more
than
a
thousand
crowns
of
damage
caused
by
heavy
rain
on
the
occasion
when
the
duchess
made
her
entrance
into
rome
he
related
how
he
was
in
despair
and
how
i
put
heart
into
him
and
went
on
to
describe
how
i
had
pointed
several
large
pieces
of
artillery
in
the
direction
where
the
clouds
were
thickest
and
whence
a
deluge
of
water
was
already
pouring
then
when
i
began
to
fire
the
rain
stopped
and
at
the
fourth
discharge
the
sun
shone
out
and
so
i
was
the
sole
cause
of
the
festival
succeeding
to
the
joy
of
everybody
on
hearing
this
narration
the
duchess
said
benvenuto
is
one
of
the
artists
of
merit
who
enjoyed
the
goodwill
of
my
late
husband
duke
alessandro
and
i
shall
always
hold
them
in
mind
if
an
opportunity
comes
of
doing
such
men
she
also
talked
of
me
to
duke
ottavio
for
these
reasons
i
meant
to
go
straight
to
the
house
of
her
excellency
which
was
a
very
fine
palace
situated
in
borgio
vecchio
i
should
have
been
quite
safe
from
recapture
by
the
pope
if
i
could
have
stayed
there
but
my
exploits
up
to
this
point
had
been
too
marvellous
for
a
human
being
and
god
was
unwilling
to
encourage
my
vainglory
accordingly
for
my
own
good
he
chastised
me
a
second
time
worse
even
than
the
first
the
cause
of
this
was
that
while
i
was
crawling
on
all
fours
up
those
steps
a
servant
of
cardinal
cornaro
recognized
me
his
master
was
then
lodging
in
the
palace
so
the
servant
ran
up
to
his
room
and
woke
him
crying
reverend
monsignor
your
friend
benvenuto
is
down
there
he
has
escaped
from
the
castle
and
is
crawling
on
all
fours
streaming
with
blood
to
all
appearances
he
has
broken
a
leg
and
we
know
whether
he
is
the
cardinal
exclaimed
at
once
and
carry
him
upon
your
back
into
my
room
when
i
arrived
he
told
me
to
be
under
no
apprehension
and
sent
for
the
first
physicians
of
rome
to
take
my
case
in
hand
among
them
was
maestro
jacomo
of
perugia
a
most
excellent
and
able
surgeon
he
set
the
bone
with
dexterity
then
bound
the
limb
up
and
bled
me
with
his
own
hand
it
happened
that
my
veins
were
swollen
far
beyond
their
usual
size
and
he
too
wished
to
make
a
pretty
wide
incision
accordingly
the
blood
sprang
forth
so
copiously
and
spurted
with
such
force
into
his
face
that
he
had
to
abandon
the
operation
he
regarded
this
as
a
very
bad
omen
and
could
hardly
be
prevailed
upon
to
undertake
my
cure
indeed
he
often
expressed
a
wish
to
leave
me
remembering
that
he
ran
no
little
risk
of
punishment
for
having
treated
my
case
or
rather
for
having
proceeded
to
the
end
with
it
the
cardinal
had
me
placed
in
a
secret
chamber
and
went
off
immediately
to
beg
me
from
the
pope
note
margaret
of
austria
who
married
ottavio
farnese
in
november
after
murder
cxi
during
this
while
all
rome
was
in
an
uproar
for
they
had
observed
the
bands
of
linen
fastened
to
the
great
keep
of
the
castle
and
folk
were
running
in
crowds
to
behold
so
extraordinary
a
thing
the
castellan
had
gone
off
into
one
of
his
worst
fits
of
frenzy
in
spite
of
all
his
servants
he
insisted
upon
taking
his
flight
also
from
the
tower
saying
that
no
one
could
recapture
me
except
himself
if
he
were
to
fly
after
me
messer
ruberto
pucci
the
father
of
messer
pandolfo
having
heard
of
the
great
event
went
in
person
to
inspect
the
place
afterwards
he
came
to
the
palace
where
he
met
with
cardinal
cornaro
who
told
him
exactly
what
had
happened
and
how
i
was
lodged
in
one
of
his
own
chambers
and
already
in
the
hands
these
two
worthy
men
went
together
and
threw
themselves
upon
their
knees
before
the
pope
but
he
before
they
could
get
a
word
out
cried
aloud
know
all
that
you
want
of
messer
ruberto
pucci
then
began
blessed
father
we
beg
you
for
grace
to
give
us
up
that
unfortunate
man
surely
his
great
talents
entitle
him
to
exceptional
treatment
moreover
he
has
displayed
such
audacity
blent
with
so
much
ingenuity
that
his
exploit
might
seem
superhuman
we
know
not
for
what
crimes
you
holiness
has
kept
him
so
long
in
prison
however
if
those
crimes
are
too
exorbitant
your
holiness
is
wise
and
holy
and
may
your
will
be
done
unquestioned
still
if
they
are
such
as
can
be
condoned
we
entreat
you
to
pardon
him
for
our
the
pope
when
he
heard
this
felt
shame
and
answered
have
kept
him
in
prison
at
the
request
of
some
of
my
people
since
he
is
a
little
too
violent
in
his
behaviour
but
recognising
his
talents
and
wishing
to
keep
him
near
our
person
we
had
intended
to
treat
him
so
well
that
he
should
have
no
reason
to
return
to
france
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
of
his
bad
accident
tell
him
to
mind
his
health
and
when
he
is
recovered
we
will
make
it
up
to
him
for
all
his
those
two
excellent
men
returned
and
told
me
the
good
news
they
were
bringing
from
the
pope
meanwhile
the
nobility
of
rome
young
old
and
all
sorts
came
to
visit
me
the
castellan
out
of
his
mind
as
he
was
had
himself
carried
to
the
pope
and
when
he
was
in
the
presence
of
his
holiness
began
to
cry
out
and
to
say
that
if
he
did
not
send
me
back
to
prison
he
would
do
him
a
great
wrong
escaped
under
parole
which
he
gave
me
woe
is
me
that
he
has
flown
away
when
he
promised
not
to
fly
the
pope
said
laughing
go
for
i
will
give
him
back
to
you
without
the
castellan
then
added
speaking
to
the
pope
the
governor
to
him
to
find
out
who
helped
him
to
escape
for
if
it
is
one
of
my
men
i
will
hang
him
from
the
battlement
whence
benvenuto
on
his
departure
the
pope
called
the
governor
and
said
smiling
is
a
brave
fellow
and
his
exploit
is
something
marvellous
all
the
same
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
also
descended
from
the
fortress
at
that
very
in
so
saying
the
pope
spoke
the
truth
for
he
had
been
imprisoned
in
the
castle
for
forging
a
brief
at
the
time
when
he
was
abbreviator
parco
majoris
pope
alexander
kept
him
confined
for
some
length
of
time
and
afterwards
his
offence
being
of
too
ugly
a
nature
had
resolved
on
cutting
off
his
head
he
postponed
the
execution
however
till
after
corpus
domini
and
farnese
getting
wind
of
the
will
summoned
pietro
chiavelluzi
with
a
lot
of
horses
and
managed
to
corrupt
some
of
the
castle
guards
with
money
accordingly
upon
the
day
of
corpus
domini
while
the
pope
was
going
in
procession
farnese
got
into
a
basket
and
was
let
down
by
a
rope
to
the
ground
at
that
time
the
outer
walls
had
not
been
built
around
the
castle
only
the
great
central
tower
existed
so
that
he
had
not
the
same
enormous
difficulty
that
i
met
with
in
escaping
moreover
he
had
been
imprisoned
justly
and
i
against
all
equity
what
he
wanted
was
to
brag
before
the
governor
of
having
in
his
youth
been
spirited
and
brave
and
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
was
calling
attention
to
his
own
huge
rogueries
he
said
then
and
tell
him
to
reveal
his
accomplice
without
apprehension
to
you
be
the
man
who
he
may
be
since
i
have
pardoned
him
and
this
you
may
assure
him
without
note
see
above
note
the
collegium
abbreviatorum
di
parco
majori
consisted
of
members
it
was
established
by
pius
ii
onofrio
panvinio
tells
this
story
of
paul
imprisonment
and
escape
but
places
it
in
the
papacy
of
innocent
viii
see
pauli
in
continuation
of
platina
cxii
so
the
governor
came
to
see
me
two
days
before
he
had
been
made
bishop
of
jesi
and
when
he
entered
he
said
benvenuto
although
my
office
is
wont
to
frighten
men
i
come
to
set
your
mind
at
rest
and
to
do
this
i
have
full
authority
from
his
own
lips
who
told
me
how
he
also
escaped
from
angelo
but
had
many
aids
and
much
company
else
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
accomplish
it
i
swear
by
the
sacraments
which
i
carry
on
my
person
for
i
was
consecrated
bishop
two
days
since
that
the
pope
has
set
you
free
and
pardoned
you
and
is
very
sorry
for
your
accident
attend
to
your
health
and
take
all
things
for
the
best
for
your
imprisonment
which
you
certainly
underwent
without
a
shadow
of
guilt
will
have
been
for
your
perpetual
welfare
henceforward
you
will
tread
down
poverty
and
will
have
to
go
back
to
france
wearing
out
your
life
in
this
place
and
in
that
tell
me
then
frankly
how
the
matter
went
and
who
rendered
you
assistance
afterwards
take
comfort
repose
and
i
began
at
the
beginning
and
related
the
whole
story
exactly
as
it
had
happened
giving
him
the
most
minute
countersigns
down
to
the
who
bore
me
on
his
back
when
the
governor
had
heard
the
whole
he
said
a
surety
these
are
too
great
exploits
for
one
man
alone
no
one
but
you
could
have
performed
so
he
made
me
reach
my
hand
forth
and
said
of
good
courage
and
comfort
your
heart
for
by
this
hand
which
i
am
holding
you
are
free
and
if
you
live
shall
live
in
while
thus
conversing
with
me
he
had
kept
a
whole
heap
of
great
lords
and
noblemen
waiting
who
were
come
to
visit
me
saying
one
to
the
other
us
go
to
see
this
man
who
works
so
when
he
departed
they
stayed
by
me
and
one
made
me
offers
of
kindness
and
another
made
me
presents
while
i
was
being
entertained
in
this
way
the
governor
returned
to
the
pope
and
reported
all
that
i
had
said
as
chance
would
have
it
signor
pier
luigi
the
son
happened
to
be
present
and
all
the
company
gave
signs
of
great
astonishment
his
holiness
remarked
a
truth
this
is
a
marvellous
then
pier
luigi
began
to
speak
as
follows
blessed
father
if
you
set
that
man
free
he
will
do
something
still
more
marvellous
because
he
has
by
far
too
bold
a
spirit
i
will
tell
you
another
story
about
him
which
you
do
not
know
that
benvenuto
of
yours
before
he
was
imprisoned
came
to
words
with
a
gentleman
of
cardinal
santa
fiore
about
some
trifle
which
the
latter
had
said
to
him
now
retort
was
so
swaggeringly
insolent
that
it
amounted
to
throwing
down
a
cartel
the
gentleman
referred
the
matter
to
the
cardinal
who
said
that
if
he
once
laid
hands
on
benvenuto
he
would
soon
clear
his
head
of
such
folly
when
the
fellow
heard
this
he
got
a
little
of
his
ready
with
which
he
is
accustomed
to
hit
a
penny
in
the
middle
accordingly
one
day
when
the
cardinal
was
looking
out
of
a
window
shop
being
under
the
palace
of
the
cardinal
he
took
his
gun
and
pointed
it
upon
the
cardinal
the
cardinal
however
had
been
warned
and
presently
withdrew
benvenuto
in
order
that
his
intention
might
escape
notice
aimed
at
a
pigeon
which
was
brooding
high
up
in
a
hole
of
the
palace
and
hit
it
exactly
in
the
feat
one
would
have
thought
incredible
now
let
your
holiness
do
what
you
think
best
about
him
i
have
discharged
my
duty
by
saying
what
i
have
it
might
even
come
into
his
head
imagining
that
he
had
been
wrongly
imprisoned
to
fire
upon
your
holiness
indeed
he
is
too
truculent
by
far
too
confident
in
his
own
powers
when
he
killed
pompeo
he
gave
him
two
stabs
with
a
poniard
in
the
throat
in
the
midst
of
ten
men
who
were
guarding
him
then
he
escaped
to
their
great
shame
and
yet
they
were
no
inconsiderable

affair

this
gentleman
came
to
me

showed
me
a
little

had
been
discoloured

the
proper
tool
for
cleaning
up
his
ring
and
that
he
had
better
go
to
another
goldsmith
without
further
provocation
he
retorted
that
i
was
a
donkey
whereupon
i
said
that
he
was
not
speaking
the
truth
that
i
was
a
better
man
than
he
in
every
respect
but
that
if
he
kept
on
irritating
me
i
would
give
him
harder
kicks
than
any
donkey
could
he
related
the
matter
to
the
cardinal
and
painted
me
as
black
as
the
devil
in
hell
two
days
afterwards
i
shot
a
wild
pigeon
in
a
cleft
high
up
behind
the
palace
the
bird
was
brooding
in
that
cleft
and
i
had
often
seen
a
goldsmith
named
giovan
francesco
della
tacca
from
milan
fire
at
it
but
he
never
hit
it
on
the
day
when
i
shot
it
the
pigeon
scarcely
showed
its
head
being
suspicious
because
it
had
been
so
often
fired
at
now
this
giovan
francesco
and
i
were
rivals
in
shooting
wildfowl
and
some
gentlemen
of
my
acquaintance
who
happened
to
be
at
my
shop
called
my
attention
saying
there
is
giovan
francesco
della
pigeon
at
which
he
has
so
often
fired
look
now
the
poor
creature
is
so
frightened
that
it
hardly
ventures
to
put
its
head
i
raised
my
eyes
and
said
morsel
of
its
head
is
quite
enough
for
me
to
shoot
it
by
if
it
only
stays
till
i
can
point
my
the
gentlemen
protested
that
even
the
man
who
invented
firearms
could
not
hit
it
i
replied
bet
a
bottle
of
that
excellent
greek
wine
palombo
the
host
keeps
that
if
it
keeps
quiet
long
enough
for
me
to
point
my
good
broccardo
so
i
used
to
call
my
gun
i
will
hit
it
in
that
portion
of
its
head
which
it
is
so
i
aimed
my
gun
elevating
my
arms
and
using
no
other
rest
and
did
what
i
had
promised
without
thinking
of
the
cardinal
or
any
other
person
on
the
contrary
i
held
the
cardinal
for
my
very
good
patron
let
the
world
then
take
notice
when
fortune
has
the
will
to
ruin
a
man
how
many
divers
ways
she
takes
the
pope
swelling
with
rage
and
grumbling
remained
revolving
what
his
son
had
told
him
note
cellini
calls
it
it
is
properly
a
sort
of
brass
rod
with
a
wooden
handle
cxiv
two
days
afterwards
the
cardinal
cornaro
went
to
beg
a
bishopric
from
the
pope
for
a
gentleman
of
his
called
messer
andrea
centano
the
pope
in
truth
had
promised
him
a
bishopric
and
this
being
now
vacant
the
cardinal
reminded
him
of
his
word
the
pope
acknowledged
his
obligation
but
said
that
he
too
wanted
a
favour
from
his
most
reverend
lordship
which
was
that
he
would
give
up
benvenuto
to
him
on
this
the
cardinal
replied
if
your
holiness
has
pardoned
him
and
set
him
free
at
my
disposal
what
will
the
world
say
of
you
and
me
the
pope
answered
want
benvenuto
you
want
the
bishopric
let
the
world
say
what
it
the
good
cardinal
entreated
his
holiness
to
give
him
the
bishopric
and
for
the
rest
to
think
the
matter
over
and
then
to
act
according
as
his
holiness
decided
the
pope
feeling
a
certain
amount
of
shame
at
so
wickedly
breaking
his
word
took
what
seemed
a
middle
course
will
send
for
benvenuto
and
in
order
to
gratify
the
whim
i
have
will
put
him
in
those
rooms
which
open
on
my
private
garden
there
he
can
attend
to
his
recovery
and
i
will
not
prevent
any
of
his
friends
from
coming
to
visit
him
moreover
i
will
defray
his
expenses
until
his
caprice
of
mine
has
left
the
cardinal
came
home
and
sent
the
candidate
for
this
bishopric
on
the
spot
to
inform
me
that
the
pope
was
resolved
to
have
me
back
but
that
he
meant
to
keep
me
in
a
room
in
his
private
garden
where
i
could
receive
the
visits
of
my
friends
as
i
had
done
in
his
own
house
i
implored
this
messer
andrea
to
ask
the
cardinal
not
to
give
me
up
to
the
pope
but
to
let
me
act
on
my
own
account
i
would
have
myself
wrapped
up
in
a
mattress
and
carried
to
a
safe
place
outside
rome
for
if
he
gave
me
up
to
the
pope
he
would
certainly
be
sending
me
to
death
it
is
believed
that
when
the
cardinal
heard
my
petition
he
was
not
to
grant
it
but
messer
andrea
wanting
to
secure
the
bishopric
denounced
me
to
the
pope
who
sent
at
once
and
had
me
lodged
in
the
chamber
of
his
private
garden
the
cardinal
sent
me
word
not
to
eat
the
food
provided
for
me
by
the
pope
he
would
supply
me
with
provisions
meanwhile
i
was
to
keep
my
spirits
up
for
he
would
work
in
my
cause
till
i
was
set
free
matters
being
thus
arranged
i
received
daily
visits
and
generous
offers
from
many
great
lords
and
gentlemen
food
came
from
the
pope
which
i
refused
to
touch
only
eating
that
which
came
from
cardinal
cornaro
and
thus
i
remained
awhile
i
had
among
my
friends
a
young
greek
of
the
age
of
years
he
was
extremely
active
in
all
physical
exercises
and
the
best
swordsman
in
rome
rather
however
but
loyal
to
the
backbone
honest
and
ready
to
believe
what
people
told
him
he
had
heard
it
said
that
the
pope
made
known
his
intention
of
compensating
me
for
all
i
had
gone
through
it
is
true
that
the
pope
began
by
saying
so
but
he
ended
by
saying
quite
the
opposite
i
then
determined
to
confide
in
the
young
greek
and
said
to
him
brother
they
are
plotting
my
ruin
so
now
the
time
has
come
to
help
me
do
they
imagine
when
they
heap
those
extraordinary
favours
on
me
that
i
am
not
aware
they
are
done
to
betray
me
the
worthy
young
man
answered
benvenuto
they
say
in
rome
that
the
pope
has
bestowed
on
you
an
office
with
an
income
of
five
hundred
crowns
i
beseech
you
therefore
not
to
let
those
suspicions
deprive
you
of
so
great
a
all
the
same
i
begged
him
with
clasped
hands
to
aid
me
in
escaping
from
that
place
saying
i
knew
well
that
a
pope
of
that
sort
though
he
could
do
me
much
good
if
he
chose
was
really
studying
secretly
and
to
save
appearances
how
he
might
best
destroy
me
therefore
we
must
be
quick
and
try
to
save
me
from
his
clutches
if
my
friend
would
get
me
out
of
that
place
by
the
means
i
meant
to
tell
him
i
should
always
regard
him
as
the
saviour
of
my
life
and
when
occasion
came
would
lay
it
down
for
him
with
gladness
the
poor
young
man
shed
tears
and
cried
my
dear
brother
though
you
are
bringing
destruction
on
your
head
i
can
not
but
fulfil
your
wishes
so
explain
your
plan
and
i
will
do
whatever
you
may
order
albeit
much
against
my
accordingly
we
came
to
an
agreement
and
i
disclosed
to
him
the
details
of
my
scheme
which
was
certain
to
have
succeeded
without
difficulty
when
i
hoped
that
he
was
coming
to
execute
it
he
came
and
told
me
that
for
my
own
good
he
meant
to
disobey
me
being
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
he
had
heard
from
men
close
to
the
person
who
understood
the
real
state
of
my
affairs
having
nothing
else
to
rely
upon
i
remained
in
despair
and
misery
this
passed
on
the
day
of
corpus
domini
cxv
after
my
conversation
with
the
greek
the
whole
day
wore
away
and
at
night
there
came
abundant
provisions
from
the
kitchen
of
the
pope
the
cardinal
cornaro
also
sent
good
store
of
viands
from
his
kitchen
and
some
friends
of
mine
being
present
when
they
arrived
i
made
them
stay
to
supper
and
enjoyed
their
society
keeping
my
leg
in
splints
beneath
the
an
hour
after
nightfall
they
left
me
and
two
of
my
servants
having
made
me
comfortable
for
the
night
went
to
sleep
in
the
antechamber
i
had
a
dog
black
as
a
mulberry
one
of
those
hairy
ones
who
followed
me
admirably
when
i
went
out
shooting
and
never
left
my
side
during
the
night
he
lay
beneath
my
bed
and
i
had
to
call
out
at
least
three
times
to
my
servant
to
turn
him
out
because
he
howled
so
fearfully
when
the
servants
entered
the
dog
flew
at
them
and
tried
to
bite
them
they
were
frightened
and
thought
he
must
be
mad
because
he
went
on
howling
in
this
way
we
passed
the
first
four
hours
of
the
night
at
the
stroke
of
four
the
bargello
came
into
my
room
with
a
band
of
constables
then
the
dog
sprang
forth
and
flew
at
them
with
such
fury
tearing
their
capes
and
hose
that
in
their
fright
they
fancied
he
was
mad
but
the
bargello
like
an
experienced
person
told
them
is
the
nature
of
good
dogs
to
divine
and
foretell
the
mischance
coming
on
their
masters
two
of
you
take
sticks
and
beat
the
dog
off
while
the
others
strap
benvenuto
on
this
chair
then
carry
him
to
the
place
you
wot
it
was
as
i
have
said
the
night
after
corpus
domini
and
about
four
the
officers
carried
me
well
shut
up
and
covered
and
four
of
them
went
in
front
making
the
few
passengers
who
were
still
abroad
get
out
of
the
way
so
they
bore
me
to
torre
di
nona
such
is
the
name
of
the
place
and
put
me
in
the
condemned
cell
i
was
left
upon
a
wretched
mattress
under
the
care
of
a
guard
who
kept
all
night
mourning
over
my
bad
luck
and
saying
to
me
poor
benvenuto
what
have
you
done
to
those
great
folk
i
could
now
form
a
very
good
opinion
of
what
was
going
to
happen
to
me
partly
by
the
place
in
which
i
found
myself
and
also
by
what
the
man
had
told
me
during
a
portion
of
that
night
i
kept
racking
my
brains
what
the
cause
could
be
why
god
thought
fit
to
try
me
so
and
not
being
able
to
discover
it
i
was
violently
agitated
in
my
soul
the
guard
did
the
best
he
could
to
comfort
me
but
i
begged
him
for
the
love
of
god
to
stop
talking
seeing
i
should
be
better
able
to
compose
myself
alone
in
quiet
he
promised
to
do
as
i
asked
and
then
i
turned
my
whole
heart
to
god
devoutly
entreating
him
to
deign
to
take
me
into
his
kingdom
i
had
it
is
true
murmured
against
my
lot
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
so
far
as
human
laws
go
my
departure
from
the
world
in
this
way
would
be
too
unjust
it
is
true
also
that
i
had
committed
homicides
but
his
vicar
had
called
me
from
my
native
city
and
pardoned
me
by
the
authority
he
had
from
him
and
from
the
laws
and
what
i
had
done
had
all
been
done
in
defence
of
the
body
which
his
majesty
had
lent
me
so
i
could
not
admit
that
i
deserved
death
according
to
the
dispensation
under
which
man
dwells
here
but
it
seemed
that
what
was
happening
to
me
was
the
same
as
what
happens
to
unlucky
people
in
the
street
when
a
stone
falls
from
some
great
height
upon
their
head
and
kills
them
this
we
see
clearly
to
be
the
influence
of
the
stars
not
indeed
that
the
stars
conspire
to
do
us
good
or
evil
but
the
effect
results
from
their
conjunctions
to
which
we
are
subordinated
at
the
same
time
i
know
that
i
am
possessed
of
and
if
i
could
exert
the
faith
of
a
saint
i
am
sure
that
the
angels
of
heaven
would
bear
me
from
this
dungeon
and
relieve
me
of
all
my
afflictions
yet
inasmuch
as
god
has
not
deemed
me
worthy
of
such
miracles
i
conclude
that
those
celestial
influences
must
be
wreaking
their
malignity
upon
me
in
this
long
struggle
of
the
soul
i
spent
some
time
then
i
found
comfort
and
fell
presently
asleep
note
cellini
thought
he
was
going
to
have
his
throat
cut
and
indeed
the
torre
di
nona
was
a
suspicious
place
it
being
one
of
the
worst
criminal
prisons
in
rome
cxvi
when
the
day
dawned
the
guard
woke
me
up
and
said
unfortunate
but
worthy
man
you
have
no
more
time
to
go
on
sleeping
for
one
is
waiting
here
to
give
you
evil
i
answered
sooner
i
escape
from
this
earthly
prison
the
happier
shall
i
be
especially
as
i
am
sure
my
soul
is
saved
and
that
i
am
going
to
an
undeserved
death
christ
the
glorious
and
divine
elects
me
to
the
company
of
his
disciples
and
friends
who
like
himself
were
condemned
to
die
unjustly
i
too
am
sentenced
to
an
unjust
death
and
i
thank
god
with
humility
for
this
sign
of
grace
why
does
not
the
man
come
forward
who
has
to
pronounce
my
doom
the
guard
replied
is
too
grieved
for
you
and
sheds
then
i
called
him
by
his
name
of
messer
benedetto
da
cagli
and
cried
forward
messer
benedetto
my
friend
for
now
i
am
resolved
and
in
good
frame
of
mind
far
greater
glory
is
it
for
me
to
die
unjustly
than
if
i
had
deserved
this
fate
come
forward
i
beg
and
let
me
have
a
priest
in
order
that
i
may
speak
a
couple
of
words
with
him
i
do
not
indeed
stand
in
need
of
this
for
i
have
already
made
my
confession
to
my
lord
god
yet
i
should
like
to
observe
the
ordinances
of
our
holy
mother
church
for
though
she
has
done
me
this
abominable
wrong
i
pardon
her
with
all
my
soul
so
come
friend
messer
benedetto
and
despatch
my
business
before
i
lose
control
over
my
better
after
i
had
uttered
these
words
the
worthy
man
told
the
guard
to
lock
the
door
because
nothing
could
be
done
without
his
presence
he
then
repaired
to
the
house
of
signor
pier
wife
who
happened
to
be
in
company
with
the
duchess
of
whom
i
spoke
above
presenting
himself
before
them
both
he
spoke
as
follows
most
illustrious
mistress
i
entreat
you
for
the
love
of
god
to
tell
the
pope
that
he
must
send
some
one
else
to
pronounce
sentence
upon
benvenuto
and
perform
my
office
i
renounce
the
task
and
am
quite
decided
not
to
carry
it
then
sighing
he
departed
with
the
strongest
signs
of
inward
sorrow
the
duchess
who
was
present
frowned
and
said
this
is
the
fine
justice
dealt
out
here
in
rome
by
vicar
the
duke
my
late
husband
particularly
esteemed
this
man
for
his
good
qualities
and
eminent
abilities
he
was
unwilling
to
let
him
return
to
rome
and
would
gladly
have
kept
him
close
to
his
own
upon
this
she
retired
muttering
words
of
indignation
and
displeasure
signor
pier
wife
who
was
called
signora
jerolima
betook
herself
to
the
pope
and
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
before
him
in
the
presence
of
several
cardinals
she
pleaded
my
cause
so
warmly
that
she
woke
the
pope
to
shame
whereupon
he
said
your
sake
we
will
leave
him
quiet
yet
you
must
know
that
we
had
no
against
these
words
he
spoke
because
of
the
cardinals
who
were
around
him
and
had
listened
to
the
eloquence
of
that
lady
meanwhile
i
abode
in
extreme
discomfort
and
my
heart
kept
thumping
against
my
ribs
not
less
was
the
discomfort
of
the
men
appointed
to
discharge
the
evil
business
of
my
execution
but
when
the
hour
for
dinner
was
already
past
they
betook
themselves
to
their
several
affairs
and
my
meal
was
also
served
me
this
filled
me
with
a
glad
astonishment
and
i
exclaimed
once
truth
has
been
stronger
than
the
malice
of
the
stars
i
pray
god
therefore
that
if
it
be
his
pleasure
he
will
save
me
from
this
fearful
peril
then
i
fell
to
eating
with
the
same
stout
heart
for
my
salvation
as
i
had
previously
prepared
for
my
perdition
i
dined
well
and
afterwards
remained
without
seeing
or
hearing
any
one
until
an
hour
after
nightfall
at
that
time
the
bargello
arrived
with
a
large
part
of
his
guard
and
had
me
replaced
in
the
chair
which
brought
me
on
the
previous
evening
to
the
prison
he
spoke
very
kindly
to
me
bidding
me
be
under
no
apprehension
and
bade
his
constables
take
good
care
not
to
strike
against
my
broken
leg
but
to
treat
me
as
though
i
were
the
apple
of
their
eye
the
men
obeyed
and
brought
me
to
the
castle
whence
i
had
escaped
then
when
we
had
mounted
to
the
keep
they
left
me
shut
up
in
a
dungeon
opening
upon
a
little
court
there
is
there
note
it
will
be
remembered
that
benedetto
da
cagli
was
one
of
three
examiners
during
his
first
imprisonment
in
angelo
note
the
wife
of
pier
luigi
farnese
was
jeronima
daughter
of
luigi
orsini
count
of
pitigliano
cxvii
the
castellan
meanwhile
ill
and
afflicted
as
he
was
had
himself
transported
to
my
prison
and
exclaimed
see
that
i
have
recaptured
you
said
i
you
see
that
i
escaped
as
i
told
you
i
would
and
if
i
had
not
been
sold
by
a
venetian
cardinal
under
papal
guarantee
for
the
price
of
a
bishopric
the
pope
a
roman
and
a
farnese
and
both
of
them
have
scratched
with
impious
hands
the
face
of
the
most
sacred
laws
you
would
not
have
recovered
me
but
now
that
they
have
opened
this
vile
way
of
dealing
do
you
the
worst
you
can
in
your
turn
i
care
for
nothing
in
the
the
wretched
man
began
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
woe
is
me
woe
is
me
it
is
all
the
same
to
this
fellow
whether
he
lives
or
dies
and
behold
he
is
more
fiery
than
when
he
was
in
health
put
him
down
there
below
the
garden
and
do
not
speak
to
me
of
him
again
for
he
is
the
destined
cause
of
my
so
i
was
taken
into
a
gloomy
dungeon
below
the
level
of
a
garden
which
swam
with
water
and
was
full
of
big
spiders
and
many
venomous
worms
they
flung
me
a
wretched
mattress
of
course
hemp
gave
me
no
supper
and
locked
four
doors
upon
me
in
that
condition
i
abode
until
the
nineteenth
hour
of
the
following
day
then
i
received
food
and
i
requested
my
jailers
to
give
me
some
of
my
books
to
read
none
of
them
spoke
a
word
but
they
referred
my
prayer
to
the
unfortunate
castellan
who
had
made
inquiries
concerning
what
i
said
next
morning
they
brought
me
an
italian
bible
which
belonged
to
me
and
a
copy
of
the
chronicles
of
giovanni
villani
when
i
asked
for
certain
other
of
my
books
i
was
told
that
i
could
have
no
more
and
that
i
had
got
too
many
already
thus
then
i
continued
to
exist
in
misery
upon
that
rotten
mattress
which
in
three
days
soaked
up
water
like
a
sponge
i
could
hardly
stir
because
of
my
broken
leg
and
when
i
had
to
get
out
of
bed
to
obey
a
call
of
nature
i
crawled
on
all
fours
with
extreme
distress
in
order
not
to
foul
the
place
i
slept
in
for
one
hour
and
a
half
each
day
i
got
a
little
glimmering
of
light
which
penetrated
that
unhappy
cavern
through
a
very
narrow
aperture
only
for
so
short
a
space
of
time
could
i
read
the
rest
of
the
day
and
night
i
abode
in
darkness
enduring
my
lot
nor
ever
without
meditations
upon
god
and
on
our
human
frailty
i
thought
it
certain
that
a
few
more
days
would
put
an
end
of
my
unlucky
life
in
that
sad
place
and
in
that
miserable
manner
nevertheless
as
well
as
i
was
able
i
comforted
my
soul
by
calling
to
mind
how
much
more
painful
it
would
have
been
on
passing
from
this
life
to
have
suffered
that
unimaginable
horror
of
the
knife
now
being
as
i
was
i
should
depart
with
the
anodyne
of
sleepiness
which
robbed
death
of
half
its
former
terrors
little
by
little
i
felt
my
vital
forces
waning
until
at
last
my
vigorous
temperament
had
become
adapted
to
that
purgatory
when
i
felt
it
quite
acclimatised
i
resolved
to
put
up
with
all
those
indescribable
discomforts
so
long
as
it
held
out
note
this
mention
of
an
italian
bible
shows
that
we
are
still
in
the
days
before
the
council
of
trent
cxviii
i
began
the
bible
from
the
commencement
reading
and
reflecting
on
it
so
devoutly
and
finding
in
it
such
deep
treasures
of
delight
that
if
i
had
been
able
i
should
have
done
naught
else
but
study
it
however
light
was
wanting
and
the
thought
of
all
my
troubles
kept
recurring
and
gnawing
at
me
in
the
darkness
until
i
often
made
my
mind
up
to
put
an
end
somehow
to
my
own
life
they
did
not
allow
me
a
knife
however
and
so
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
commit
suicide
once
notwithstanding
i
took
and
propped
a
wooden
pole
i
found
there
in
position
like
a
trap
i
meant
to
make
it
topple
over
on
my
head
and
it
would
certainly
have
dashed
my
brains
out
but
when
i
had
arranged
the
whole
machine
and
was
approaching
to
put
it
in
motion
just
at
the
moment
of
my
setting
my
hand
to
it
i
was
seized
by
an
invisible
power
and
flung
four
cubits
from
the
spot
in
such
a
terror
that
i
lay
half
dead
like
that
i
remained
from
dawn
until
the
nineteenth
hour
when
they
brought
my
food
the
jailers
must
have
visited
my
cell
several
times
without
my
taking
notice
of
them
for
when
at
last
i
heard
them
captain
sandrino
monaldi
had
entered
and
i
heard
him
saying
unhappy
man
behold
the
end
to
which
so
rare
a
genius
has
come
roused
by
these
words
i
opened
my
eyes
and
caught
sight
of
priests
with
long
gowns
on
their
backs
who
were
saying
you
told
us
he
was
dead
bozza
replied
i
found
him
and
therefore
i
told
you
then
they
lifted
me
from
where
i
lay
and
after
shaking
up
the
mattress
which
was
now
as
soppy
as
a
dish
of
maccaroni
they
flung
it
outside
the
dungeon
the
castellan
when
these
things
were
reported
to
him
sent
me
another
mattress
thereafter
when
i
searched
my
memory
to
find
what
could
have
diverted
me
from
that
design
of
suicide
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
must
have
been
some
power
divine
and
my
good
guardian
angel
note
a
florentine
banished
in
for
having
been
in
arms
against
the
medici
cxix
during
the
following
night
there
appeared
to
me
in
dreams
a
marvellous
being
in
the
form
of
a
most
lovely
youth
who
cried
as
though
he
wanted
to
reprove
me
thou
who
lent
thee
that
body
which
thou
wouldst
have
spoiled
before
its
time
i
seemed
to
answer
that
i
recognized
all
things
pertaining
to
me
as
gifts
from
the
god
of
nature
then
he
said
hast
contempt
for
his
handiwork
through
this
thy
will
to
spoil
it
commit
thyself
unto
his
guidance
and
lose
not
hope
in
his
great
goodness
much
more
he
added
in
words
of
marvellous
efficacy
the
thousandth
part
of
which
i
can
not
now
remember
i
began
to
consider
that
the
angel
of
my
vision
spoke
the
truth
so
i
cast
my
eyes
around
the
prison
and
saw
some
scraps
of
rotten
brick
with
the
fragments
of
which
rubbing
one
against
the
other
i
composed
a
paste
then
creeping
on
all
fours
as
i
was
compelled
to
go
i
crawled
up
to
an
angle
of
my
dungeon
door
and
gnawed
a
splinter
from
it
with
my
teeth
having
achieved
this
feat
i
waited
till
the
light
came
on
my
prison
that
was
from
the
hour
of
twenty
and
a
half
to
and
a
half
when
it
arrived
i
began
to
write
the
best
i
could
on
some
blank
pages
in
my
bible
and
rebuked
the
regents
of
my
intellectual
self
for
being
too
impatient
to
endure
this
life
they
replied
to
my
body
with
excuses
drawn
from
all
that
they
had
suffered
and
the
body
gave
them
hope
of
better
fortune
to
this
effect
then
by
way
of
dialogue
i
wrote
as
follows
in
the
body
regents
of
my
soul
ah
cruel
ye
have
ye
such
hate
of
life
spirits
of
his
soul
heaven
against
you
roll
who
stands
for
us
who
saves
us
in
the
strife
let
us
o
let
us
go
toward
better
life
go
not
yet
awhile
ye
shall
be
happier
and
lighter
heaven
gives
this
ye
were
ever
yet
spirits
will
remain
some
little
while
if
only
by
great
god
you
promised
are
such
grace
that
no
worse
woes
on
us
be
set
after
this
i
recovered
strength
and
when
i
had
heartened
up
myself
i
continued
reading
in
the
bible
and
my
eyes
became
so
used
to
that
darkness
that
i
could
now
read
for
three
hours
instead
of
the
bare
hour
and
a
half
i
was
able
to
employ
before
with
profound
astonishment
i
dwelt
upon
the
force
of
spirit
in
those
men
of
great
simplicity
who
believed
so
fervently
that
he
would
bring
all
their
desire
to
pass
i
then
proceeded
to
reckon
in
my
own
case
too
on
assistance
both
because
of
his
divine
power
and
mercy
and
also
because
of
my
own
innocence
and
at
all
hours
sometimes
in
prayer
and
sometimes
in
communion
with
god
i
abode
in
those
high
thoughts
of
him
there
flowed
into
my
soul
so
powerful
a
delight
from
these
reflections
upon
god
that
i
took
no
further
thought
for
all
the
anguish
i
had
suffered
but
rather
spent
the
day
in
singing
psalms
and
divers
other
compositions
on
the
theme
of
his
divinity
i
was
greatly
troubled
however
by
one
particular
annoyance
my
nails
had
grown
so
long
that
i
could
not
touch
my
body
without
wounding
it
i
could
not
dress
myself
but
what
they
turned
inside
or
out
to
my
great
torment
moreover
my
teeth
began
to
perish
in
my
mouth
i
became
aware
of
this
because
the
dead
teeth
being
pushed
out
by
the
living
ones
my
gums
were
gradually
perforated
and
the
points
of
the
roots
pierced
through
the
tops
of
their
cases
when
i
was
aware
of
this
i
used
to
pull
one
out
as
though
it
were
a
weapon
from
a
scabbard
without
any
pain
or
loss
of
blood
very
many
of
them
did
i
lose
in
this
way
nevertheless
i
accommodated
myself
to
these
new
troubles
also
at
times
i
sang
at
times
i
prayed
and
at
times
i
wrote
by
means
of
the
paste
of
i
have
described
above
at
this
time
i
began
composing
a
capitolo
in
praise
of
my
prison
relating
in
it
all
the
accidents
which
had
befallen
me
this
poem
i
mean
to
insert
in
its
proper
place
note
capitolo
is
the
technical
name
for
a
copy
of
verses
in
rima
on
a
chosen
theme
poems
of
this
kind
mostly
burlesque
or
satirical
were
very
popular
in
age
they
used
to
be
written
on
trifling
or
obscene
subjects
in
a
style
berni
stamped
the
character
of
high
art
upon
the
species
which
had
long
been
in
use
among
the
unlettered
vulgar

the
good
castellan
used
frequently
to
send
messengers
to
find
out
secretly
what
i
was
doing
so
it
happened
on
the
last
day
of
july
that
i
was
rejoicing
greatly
by
myself
alone
while
i
bethought
me
of
the
festival
they
keep
in
rome
upon
the
of
august
and
i
was
saying
to
myself
former
years
i
kept
the
feast
among
the
pleasures
and
the
frailties
of
the
world
this
year
i
shall
keep
it
in
communion
with
god
oh
how
far
more
happy
am
i
thus
than
i
was
then
the
persons
who
heard
me
speak
these
words
reported
them
to
the
castellan
he
was
greatly
annoyed
and
exclaimed
god
that
fellow
lives
and
triumphs
in
his
infinite
distress
while
i
lack
all
things
in
the
midst
of
comfort
and
am
dying
only
on
account
of
him
go
quickly
and
fling
him
into
that
deepest
of
the
subterranean
dungeons
where
the
preacher
foiano
was
starved
to
death
perhaps
when
he
finds
himself
in
such
ill
plight
he
will
begin
to
droop
his
captain
sandrino
monaldi
came
at
once
into
my
prison
with
about
twenty
of
the
servants
they
found
me
on
my
knees
and
i
did
not
turn
at
their
approach
but
went
on
paying
my
orisons
before
a
god
the
father
surrounded
with
angels
and
a
christ
arising
victorious
from
the
grave
which
i
had
sketched
upon
the
wall
with
a
little
piece
of
charcoal
i
had
found
covered
up
with
earth
this
was
after
i
had
lain
four
months
upon
my
back
in
bed
with
my
leg
broken
and
had
so
often
dreamed
that
angels
came
and
ministered
to
me
that
at
the
end
of
those
four
months
the
limb
became
as
sound
as
though
it
never
had
been
fractured
so
then
these
fellows
entered
all
in
armour
as
fearful
of
me
as
though
i
were
a
dragon
the
captain
spoke
as
follows
must
be
aware
that
there
are
many
of
us
here
and
our
entrance
has
made
a
tumult
in
this
place
yet
you
do
not
turn
when
i
heard
these
words
i
was
well
able
to
conceive
what
greater
harm
might
happen
to
me
but
being
used
and
hardened
to
misfortune
i
said
to
them
this
god
who
supports
me
to
him
in
heaven
i
have
turned
my
soul
my
contemplation
and
all
my
vital
spirits
to
you
i
have
turned
precisely
what
belongs
to
you
what
there
is
of
good
in
me
you
are
not
worthy
to
behold
nor
can
you
touch
it
do
then
to
that
which
is
under
your
control
all
the
evil
you
are
the
captain
in
some
alarm
and
not
knowing
what
i
might
be
on
the
point
of
doing
said
to
four
of
his
tallest
fellows
all
your
arms
when
they
had
done
so
he
added
upon
the
instant
leap
on
him
and
secure
him
well
do
you
think
he
is
the
devil
that
so
many
of
us
should
be
afraid
of
him
hold
him
tight
now
that
he
may
not
escape
seized
by
them
with
force
and
roughly
handled
and
anticipating
something
far
worse
than
what
afterwards
happened
i
lifted
my
eyes
to
christ
and
said
just
god
thou
paidest
all
our
debts
upon
that
cross
of
thine
wherefore
then
must
my
innocence
be
made
to
pay
the
debts
of
whom
i
do
not
even
know
nevertheless
thy
will
be
meanwhile
the
men
were
carrying
me
away
with
a
great
lighted
torch
and
i
thought
that
they
were
about
to
throw
me
down
the
oubliette
of
sammabo
this
was
the
name
given
to
a
fearful
place
which
had
swallowed
many
men
alive
for
when
they
are
cast
into
it
the
fall
to
the
bottom
of
a
deep
pit
in
the
foundation
of
the
castle
this
did
not
however
happen
to
me
wherefore
i
thought
that
i
had
made
a
very
good
bargain
when
they
placed
me
in
that
hideous
dungeon
i
have
spoken
of
where
fra
foiano
died
of
hunger
and
left
me
there
without
doing
me
further
injury
when
i
was
alone
i
began
to
sing
a
profundis
clamavi
a
and
te
domine
speravi
during
the
whole
of
that
first
day
of
august
i
kept
festival
with
god
my
heart
rejoicing
ever
in
the
strength
of
hope
and
faith
on
the
second
day
they
drew
me
from
that
hole
and
took
me
back
again
to
the
prison
where
i
had
drawn
those
representations
of
god
on
arriving
there
the
sight
of
them
filled
me
with
such
sweetness
and
such
gladness
that
i
wept
abundantly
on
every
day
that
followed
the
castellan
sent
to
know
what
i
was
doing
and
saying
the
pope
who
had
heard
the
whole
history
and
i
must
add
that
the
doctors
had
already
given
the
castellan
over
spoke
as
follows
my
castellan
dies
i
will
let
him
put
that
benvenuto
to
death
in
any
way
he
likes
for
he
is
the
cause
of
his
death
and
so
the
good
man
shall
not
die
on
hearing
these
words
from
the
mouth
of
duke
pier
luigi
the
castellan
replied
then
the
pope
has
given
me
benvenuto
and
wishes
me
to
take
my
vengeance
on
him
dismiss
the
matter
from
your
mind
and
leave
me
to
if
the
heart
of
the
pope
was
against
me
that
of
the
castellan
was
now
at
the
commencement
savage
and
cruel
in
the
extreme
at
this
juncture
the
invisible
being
who
had
diverted
me
from
my
intention
of
suicide
came
to
me
being
still
invisible
but
with
a
clear
voice
and
shook
me
and
made
me
rise
and
said
to
me
me
my
benvenuto
quick
quick
betake
thyself
to
god
with
thy
accustomed
prayers
and
cry
out
loudly
loudly
in
a
sudden
consternation
i
fell
upon
my
knees
and
recited
several
of
my
prayers
in
a
loud
voice
after
this
i
said
habitat
in
adjutorio
then
i
communed
a
space
with
god
and
in
an
instant
the
same
clear
and
open
voice
said
to
me
to
rest
and
have
no
further
fear
the
meaning
of
this
was
that
the
castellan
after
giving
the
most
cruel
orders
for
my
death
suddenly
countermanded
them
and
said
not
this
benvenuto
the
man
whom
i
have
so
warmly
defended
whom
i
know
of
a
surety
to
be
innocent
and
who
has
been
so
greatly
wronged
oh
how
will
god
have
mercy
on
me
and
my
sins
if
i
do
not
pardon
those
who
have
done
me
the
greatest
injuries
oh
why
should
i
injure
a
man
both
worthy
and
innocent
who
has
only
done
me
services
and
honour
go
to
instead
of
killing
him
i
give
him
life
and
liberty
and
in
my
will
have
it
written
that
none
shall
demand
of
him
the
heavy
debt
for
his
expenses
here
which
he
would
elsewise
have
to
this
the
pope

and
took
it

ill

see
fiorentina
lib
xii
chap
cxxi
i
meanwhile
continued
to
pray
as
usual
and
to
write
my
capitolo
and
every
night
i
was
visited
with
the
gladdest
and
most
pleasant
dreams
that
could
be
possibly
imagined
it
seemed
to
me
while
dreaming
that
i
was
always
in
the
visible
company
of
that
being
whose
voice
and
touch
while
he
was
still
invisible
i
had
so
often
felt
to
him
i
made
but
one
request
and
this
i
urged
most
earnestly
namely
that
he
would
bring
me
where
i
could
behold
the
sun
i
told
him
that
this
was
the
sole
desire
i
had
and
that
if
i
could
but
see
the
sun
once
only
i
should
die
contented
all
the
disagreeable
circumstances
of
my
prison
had
become
as
it
were
to
me
friendly
and
companionable
not
one
of
them
gave
me
annoyance
nevertheless
i
ought
to
say
that
the
parasites
who
were
waiting
for
him
to
hang
me
from
the
battlement
whence
i
had
made
my
escape
when
they
saw
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
to
the
exact
opposite
of
what
he
previously
threatened
were
unable
to
endure
the
disappointment
accordingly
they
kept
continually
trying
to
inspire
me
with
the
fear
of
imminent
death
by
means
of
various
terrifying
hints
but
as
i
have
already
said
i
had
become
so
well
acquainted
with
troubles
of
this
sort
that
i
was
incapable
of
fear
and
nothing
any
longer
could
disturb
me
only
i
had
that
one
great
longing
to
behold
the
sphere
of
the
sun
if
only
in
a
dream
thus
then
while
i
spent
many
hours
a
day
in
prayer
with
deep
emotion
of
the
spirit
toward
christ
i
used
always
to
say
very
son
of
god
i
pray
thee
by
thy
birth
by
thy
death
upon
the
cross
and
by
thy
glorious
resurrection
that
thou
wilt
deign
to
let
me
see
the
sun
if
not
otherwise
at
least
in
dreams
but
if
thou
wilt
grant
me
to
behold
it
with
these
mortal
eyes
of
mine
i
engage
myself
to
come
and
visit
thee
at
thy
holy
this
vow
and
these
my
greatest
prayers
to
god
i
made
upon
the
of
october
in
the
year
upon
the
following
morning
which
was
the
of
october
i
woke
at
daybreak
perhaps
an
hour
before
the
rising
of
the
sun
dragging
myself
from
the
miserable
lair
in
which
i
lay
i
put
some
clothes
on
for
it
had
begun
to
be
cold
then
i
prayed
more
devoutly
than
ever
i
had
done
in
the
past
fervently
imploring
christ
that
he
would
at
least
grant
me
the
favour
of
knowing
by
divine
inspiration
what
sin
i
was
so
sorely
expiating
and
since
his
divine
majesty
had
not
deemed
me
worthy
of
beholding
the
sun
even
in
a
dream
i
besought
him
to
let
me
know
the
cause
of
my
punishment
cxxii
i
had
barely
uttered
these
words
when
that
invisible
being
like
a
whirlwind
caught
me
up
and
bore
me
away
into
a
large
room
where
he
made
himself
visible
to
my
eyes
in
human
form
appearing
like
a
young
man
whose
beard
is
just
growing
with
a
face
of
indescribable
beauty
but
austere
not
wanton
he
bade
me
look
around
the
room
and
said
crowd
of
men
thou
seest
in
this
place
are
all
those
who
up
to
this
day
have
been
born
and
afterwards
have
died
upon
the
thereupon
i
asked
him
why
he
brought
me
hither
and
he
answered
with
me
and
thou
shalt
soon
in
my
hand
i
had
a
poniard
and
upon
my
back
a
coat
of
mail
and
so
he
led
me
through
that
vast
hall
pointing
out
the
people
who
were
walking
by
innumerable
thousands
up
and
down
this
way
and
that
he
led
me
onward
and
went
forth
in
front
of
me
through
a
little
low
door
into
a
place
which
looked
like
a
narrow
street
and
when
he
drew
me
after
him
into
the
street
at
the
moment
of
leaving
the
hall
behold
i
was
disarmed
and
clothed
in
a
white
shirt
with
nothing
on
my
head
and
i
was
walking
on
the
right
hand
of
my
companion
finding
myself
in
this
condition
i
was
seized
with
wonder
because
i
did
not
recognise
the
street
and
when
i
lifted
my
eyes
i
discerned
that
the
splendour
of
the
sun
was
striking
on
a
wall
as
it
were
a
just
above
my
head
then
i
said
my
friend
what
must
i
do
in
order
to
be
able
to
ascend
so
high
that
i
may
gaze
upon
the
sphere
of
the
sun
himself
he
pointed
out
some
huge
stairs
which
were
on
my
right
hand
and
said
to
me
up
thither
by
quitting
his
side
i
ascended
the
stairs
backwards
and
gradually
began
to
come
within
the
region
of
the
sunlight
then
i
hastened
my
steps
and
went
on
always
walking
backwards
as
i
have
described
until
i
discovered
the
whole
sphere
of
the
sun
the
strength
of
his
rays
as
is
their
wont
first
made
me
close
my
eyes
but
becoming
aware
of
my
misdoing
i
opened
them
wide
and
gazing
steadfastly
at
the
sun
exclaimed
my
sun
for
whom
i
have
passionately
yearned
albeit
your
rays
may
blind
me
i
do
not
wish
to
look
on
anything
again
but
this
so
i
stayed
awhile
with
my
eyes
fixed
steadily
on
him
and
after
a
brief
space
i
beheld
in
one
moment
the
whole
might
of
those
great
burning
rays
fling
themselves
upon
the
left
side
of
the
sun
so
that
the
orb
remained
quite
clear
without
its
rays
and
i
was
able
to
contemplate
it
with
vast
delight
it
seemed
to
me
something
marvellous
that
the
rays
should
be
removed
in
that
manner
then
i
reflected
what
divine
grace
it
was
which
god
had
granted
me
that
morning
and
cried
aloud
wonderful
thy
power
oh
glorious
thy
virtue
how
far
greater
is
the
grace
which
thou
art
granting
me
than
that
which
i
expected
the
sun
without
his
rays
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
bath
of
the
purest
molten
gold
neither
more
nor
less
while
i
stood
contemplating
this
wondrous
thing
i
noticed
that
the
middle
of
the
sphere
began
to
swell
and
the
swollen
surface
grew
and
suddenly
a
christ
upon
the
cross
formed
itself
out
of
the
same
substance
as
the
sun
he
bore
the
aspect
of
divine
benignity
with
such
fair
grace
that
the
mind
of
man
could
not
conceive
the
thousandth
part
of
it
and
while
i
gazed
in
ecstasy
i
shouted
miracle
a
miracle
o
god
o
clemency
divine
o
immeasurable
goodness
what
is
it
thou
hast
deigned
this
day
to
show
me
while
i
was
gazing
and
exclaiming
thus
the
christ
moved
toward
that
part
where
his
rays
were
settled
and
the
middle
of
the
sun
once
more
bulged
out
as
it
had
done
before
the
boss
expanded
and
suddenly
transformed
itself
into
the
shape
of
a
most
beautiful
madonna
who
appeared
to
be
sitting
enthroned
on
high
holding
her
child
in
her
arms
with
an
attitude
of
the
greatest
charm
and
a
smile
upon
her
face
on
each
side
of
her
was
an
angel
whose
beauty
far
surpasses
imagination
i
also
saw
within
the
rondure
of
the
sun
upon
the
right
hand
a
figure
robed
like
a
priest
this
turned
its
back
to
me
and
kept
its
face
directed
to
the
madonna
and
the
christ
all
these
things
i
beheld
actual
clear
and
vivid
and
kept
returning
thanks
to
the
glory
of
god
as
loud
as
i
was
able
the
marvellous
apparition
remained
before
me
little
more
than
half
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
it
dissolved
and
i
was
carried
back
to
my
dark
lair
i
began
at
once
to
shout
aloud
virtue
of
god
hath
deigned
to
show
me
all
his
glory
the
which
perchance
no
mortal
eye
hath
ever
seen
before
therefore
i
know
surely
that
i
am
free
and
fortunate
and
in
the
grace
of
god
but
you
miscreants
shall
be
miscreants
still
accursed
and
in
the
wrath
of
god
mark
this
for
i
am
certain
of
it
that
on
the
day
of
all
saints
the
day
upon
which
i
was
born
in
on
the
first
of
november
at
four
hours
after
nightfall
on
that
day
which
is
coming
you
will
be
forced
to
lead
me
from
this
gloomy
dungeon
less
than
this
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
because
i
have
seen
it
with
these
eyes
of
mine
and
in
that
throne
of
god
the
priest
who
kept
his
face
turned
to
god
and
his
back
to
me
that
priest
was
peter
pleading
my
cause
for
the
shame
he
felt
that
such
foul
wrongs
should
be
done
to
christians
in
his
own
house
you
may
go
and
tell
it
to
whom
you
like
for
none
on
earth
has
the
power
to
do
me
harm
henceforward
and
tell
that
lord
who
keeps
me
here
that
if
he
will
give
me
wax
or
paper
and
the
means
of
portraying
this
glory
of
god
which
was
revealed
to
me
most
assuredly
shall
i
convince
him
of
that
which
now
perhaps
he
holds
in
cxxiii
the
physicians
gave
the
castellan
no
hope
of
his
recovery
yet
he
remained
with
a
clear
intellect
and
the
humours
which
used
to
afflict
him
every
year
had
passed
away
he
devoted
himself
entirely
to
the
care
of
his
soul
and
his
conscience
seemed
to
smite
him
because
he
felt
that
i
had
suffered
and
was
suffering
a
grievous
wrong
the
pope
received
information
from
him
of
the
extraordinary
things
which
i
related
in
answer
to
which
his
holiness
sent
one
who
had
no
faith
either
in
god
or
aught
i
was
mad
and
that
he
must
do
his
best
to
mend
his
health
when
the
castellan
received
this
message
he
sent
to
cheer
me
up
and
furnished
me
with
writing
materials
and
wax
and
certain
little
wooden
instruments
employed
in
working
wax
adding
many
words
of
courtesy
which
were
reported
by
one
of
his
servants
who
bore
me
this
man
was
totally
the
opposite
of
that
rascally
gang
who
had
wished
to
see
me
hanged
i
took
the
paper
and
the
wax
and
began
to
work
and
while
i
was
working
i
wrote
the
following
sonnet
addressed
to
the
castellan
i
my
lord
could
show
to
you
the
truth
of
that
eternal
light
to
me
by
heaven
in
this
low
life
revealed
you
sure
had
given
more
heed
to
mine
than
to
a
sooth
ah
could
the
pastor
of
flock
in
ruth
believe
how
god
this
soul
with
sight
hath
shriven
of
glory
unto
which
no
wight
hath
striven
ere
he
escaped
cave
of
care
uncouth
the
gates
of
justice
holy
and
austere
would
roll
asunder
and
rude
impious
rage
fall
chained
with
shrieks
that
should
assail
the
skies
had
i
but
light
ah
me
my
art
should
rear
a
monument
of
high
equipage
nor
should
my
misery
bear
so
grim
a
cxxiv
on
the
following
day
when
the
servant
of
the
castellan
who
was
my
friend
brought
me
my
food
i
gave
him
this
sonnet
copied
out
in
writing
without
informing
the
other
servants
who
were
my
enemies
he
handed
it
to
the
castellan
at
that
time
this
worthy
man
would
gladly
have
granted
me
my
liberty
because
he
fancied
that
the
great
wrong
done
to
me
was
a
main
cause
of
his
death
he
took
the
sonnet
and
having
read
it
more
than
once
exclaimed
are
neither
the
words
nor
the
thoughts
of
a
madman
but
rather
of
a
sound
and
worthy
without
delay
he
ordered
his
secretary
to
take
it
to
the
pope
and
place
it
in
his
own
hands
adding
a
request
for
my
deliverance
while
the
secretary
was
on
his
way
with
my
sonnet
to
the
pope
the
castellan
sent
me
lights
for
day
and
night
together
with
all
the
conveniences
one
could
wish
for
in
that
place
the
result
of
this
was
that
i
began
to
recover
from
my
physical
depression
which
had
reached
a
very
serious
degree
the
pope
read
the
sonnet
several
times
then
he
sent
word
to
the
castellan
that
he
meant
presently
to
do
what
would
be
pleasing
to
him
certainly
the
pope
had
no
unwillingness
to
release
me
then
but
signor
pier
luigi
his
son
as
it
were
in
the
despite
kept
me
there
by
force
the
death
of
the
castellan
was
drawing
near
and
while
i
was
engaged
in
drawing
and
modelling
that
miracle
which
i
had
seen
upon
the
morning
of
all
day
he
sent
his
nephew
piero
ugolini
to
show
me
certain
jewels
no
sooner
had
i
set
eyes
on
them
than
i
exclaimed
is
the
countersign
of
my
deliverance
then
the
young
man
who
was
not
a
person
of
much
intelligence
began
to
say
think
of
that
benvenuto
i
replied
your
gems
away
for
i
am
so
treated
here
that
i
have
no
light
to
see
by
except
what
this
murky
cavern
gives
and
that
is
not
enough
to
test
the
quality
of
precious
stones
but
as
regards
my
deliverance
from
this
dungeon
the
day
will
not
end
before
you
come
to
fetch
me
out
it
shall
and
must
be
so
and
you
will
not
be
able
to
prevent
the
man
departed
and
had
me
locked
in
but
after
he
had
remained
away
two
hours
by
the
clock
he
returned
without
armed
men
bringing
only
a
couple
of
lads
to
assist
my
movements
so
after
this
fashion
he
conducted
me
to
the
spacious
rooms
which
i
had
previously
occupied
that
is
to
say
in
where
i
obtained
all
the
conveniences
i
asked
for
cxxv
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
days
the
castellan
who
now
believed
that
i
was
at
large
and
free
succumbed
to
his
disease
and
departed
this
life
in
his
room
remained
his
brother
messer
antonio
ugolini
who
had
informed
the
deceased
governor
that
i
was
duly
released
from
what
i
learned
this
messer
antonio
received
commission
from
the
pope
to
let
me
occupy
that
commodious
prison
until
he
had
decided
what
to
do
with
me
messer
durante
of
brescia
whom
i
have
previously
mentioned
engaged
the
soldier
formerly
druggist
of
prato
to
administer
some
deadly
liquor
in
my
food
the
poison
was
to
work
slowly
producing
its
effect
at
the
end
of
four
or
five
months
they
resolved
on
mixing
pounded
diamond
with
my
victuals
now
the
diamond
is
not
a
poison
in
any
true
sense
of
the
word
but
its
incomparable
hardness
enables
it
unlike
ordinary
stones
to
retain
very
acute
angles
when
every
other
stone
is
pounded
that
extreme
sharpness
of
edge
is
lost
their
fragments
becoming
blunt
and
rounded
the
diamond
alone
preserves
its
trenchant
qualities
wherefore
if
it
chances
to
enter
the
stomach
together
with
food
the
peristaltic
motion
needful
to
digestion
brings
it
into
contact
with
the
coats
of
the
stomach
and
the
bowels
where
it
sticks
and
by
the
action
of
fresh
food
forcing
it
farther
inwards
after
some
time
perforates
the
organs
this
eventually
causes
death
any
other
sort
of
stone
or
glass
mingled
with
the
food
has
not
the
power
to
attach
itself
but
passes
onward
with
the
victuals
now
messer
durante
entrusted
a
diamond
of
trifling
value
to
one
of
the
guards
and
it
is
said
that
a
certain
lione
a
goldsmith
of
arezzo
my
great
enemy
was
commissioned
to
pound
it
the
man
happened
to
be
very
poor
and
the
diamond
was
worth
perhaps
some
scores
of
crowns
he
told
the
guard
that
the
dust
he
gave
him
back
was
the
diamond
in
question
properly
ground
down
the
morning
when
i
took
it
they
mixed
it
with
all
i
had
to
eat
it
was
a
friday
and
i
had
it
in
salad
sauce
and
pottage
that
morning
i
ate
heartily
for
i
had
fasted
on
the
previous
evening
and
this
day
was
a
festival
it
is
true
that
i
felt
the
victuals
scrunch
beneath
my
teeth
but
i
was
not
thinking
about
knaveries
of
this
sort
when
i
had
finished
some
scraps
of
salad
remained
upon
my
plate
and
certain
very
fine
and
glittering
splinters
caught
my
eye
among
these
remnants
i
collected
them
and
took
them
to
the
window
which
let
a
flood
of
light
into
the
room
and
while
i
was
examining
them
i
remembered
that
the
food
i
ate
that
morning
had
scrunched
more
than
usual
on
applying
my
senses
strictly
to
the
matter
the
verdict
of
my
eyesight
was
that
they
were
certainly
fragments
of
pounded
diamond
upon
this
i
gave
myself
up
without
doubt
as
dead
and
in
my
sorrow
had
recourse
with
pious
heart
to
holy
prayers
i
had
resolved
the
question
and
thought
that
i
was
doomed
for
the
space
of
a
whole
hour
i
prayed
fervently
to
god
returning
thanks
to
him
for
so
merciful
a
death
since
my
stars
had
sentenced
me
to
die
i
thought
it
no
bad
bargain
to
escape
from
life
so
easily
i
was
resigned
and
blessed
the
world
and
all
the
years
which
i
had
passed
in
it
now
i
was
returning
to
a
better
kingdom
with
the
grace
of
god
the
which
i
thought
i
had
most
certainly
acquired
while
i
stood
revolving
these
thoughts
in
my
mind
i
held
in
my
hand
some
flimsy
particles
of
the
reputed
diamond
which
of
a
truth
i
firmly
believed
to
be
such
now
hope
is
immortal
in
the
human
breast
therefore
i
felt
myself
as
it
were
lured
onward
by
a
gleam
of
idle
expectation
accordingly
i
took
up
a
little
knife
and
a
few
of
those
particles
and
placed
them
on
an
iron
bar
of
my
prison
then
i
brought
the
point
with
a
slow
strong
grinding
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
stone
and
felt
it
crumble
examining
the
substance
with
my
eyes
i
saw
that
it
was
so
in
a
moment
new
hope
took
possession
of
my
soul
and
i
exclaimed
i
do
not
find
my
true
foe
messer
durante
but
a
piece
of
bad
soft
stone
which
can
not
do
me
any
harm
whatever
previously
i
had
been
resolved
to
remain
quiet
and
to
die
in
peace
now
i
revolved
other
plans
but
first
i
rendered
thanks
to
god
and
blessed
poverty
for
though
poverty
is
oftentimes
the
cause
of
bringing
men
to
death
on
this
occasion
it
had
been
the
very
cause
of
my
salvation
i
mean
in
this
way
messer
durante
my
enemy
or
whoever
it
was
gave
a
diamond
to
lione
to
pound
for
me
of
the
worth
of
more
than
a
hundred
crowns
poverty
induced
him
to
keep
this
for
himself
and
to
pound
for
me
a
greenish
beryl
of
the
value
of
two
carlins
thinking
perhaps
because
it
also
was
a
stone
that
it
would
work
the
same
effect
as
the
diamond

at
this
time
the
bishop
of
pavia
brother
of
the
count
of
san
secondo
and
commonly
called
monsignor
rossi
of
parma
happened
to
be
imprisoned
in
the
castle
for
some
troublesome
affairs
at
pavia
knowing
him
to
be
my
friend
i
thrust
my
head
out
of
the
hole
in
my
cell
and
called
him
with
a
loud
voice
crying
that
those
thieves
had
given
me
a
pounded
diamond
with
the
intention
of
killing
me
i
also
sent
some
of
the
splinters
which
i
had
preserved
by
the
hand
of
one
of
his
servants
for
him
to
see
i
did
not
disclose
my
discovery
that
the
stone
was
not
a
diamond
but
told
him
that
they
had
most
assuredly
poisoned
me
after
the
death
of
that
most
worthy
man
the
castellan
during
the
short
space
of
time
i
had
to
live
i
begged
him
to
allow
me
one
loaf
a
day
from
his
own
stores
seeing
that
i
had
resolved
to
eat
nothing
which
came
from
them
to
this
request
he
answered
that
he
would
supply
me
with
victuals
messer
antonio
who
was
certainly
not
cognisant
of
the
plot
against
my
life
stirred
up
a
great
noise
and
demanded
to
see
the
pounded
stone
being
also
persuaded
that
it
was
a
diamond
but
on
reflection
that
the
pope
was
probably
at
the
bottom
of
the
affair
he
passed
it
over
lightly
after
giving
his
attention
to
the
incident
henceforth
i
ate
the
victuals
sent
me
by
the
bishop
and
continued
writing
my
capitolo
on
the
prison
into
which
i
inserted
daily
all
the
new
events
which
happened
to
me
point
by
point
but
messer
antonio
also
sent
me
food
and
he
did
this
by
the
hand
of
that
giovanni
of
prato
the
druggist
then
soldier
in
the
castle
whom
i
have
previously
mentioned
he
was
a
deadly
foe
of
mine
and
was
the
man
who
had
administered
the
powdered
diamond
so
i
told
him
that
i
would
partake
of
nothing
he
brought
me
unless
he
tasted
it
before
my
eyes
the
man
replied
that
popes
have
their
meat
tasted
i
answered
are
bound
to
taste
the
meat
for
popes
in
like
measure
you
soldier
druggist
peasant
from
prato
are
bound
to
taste
the
meat
for
a
florentine
of
my
he
retorted
with
coarse
words
which
i
was
not
slow
to
pay
back
in
kind
now
messer
antonio
felt
a
certain
shame
for
his
behaviour
he
had
it
also
in
his
mind
to
make
me
pay
the
costs
which
the
late
castellan
poor
man
remitted
in
my
favour
so
he
hunted
out
another
of
his
servants
who
was
my
friend
and
sent
me
food
by
this
hands
the
meat
was
tasted
for
me
now
with
good
grace
and
no
need
for
altercation
the
servant
in
question
told
me
that
the
pope
was
being
pestered
every
day
by
monsignor
di
morluc
who
kept
asking
for
my
extradition
on
the
part
of
the
french
king
the
pope
however
showed
little
disposition
to
give
me
up
and
cardinal
farnese
formerly
my
friend
and
patron
had
declared
that
i
ought
not
to
reckon
on
issuing
from
that
prison
for
some
length
of
time
i
replied
that
i
should
get
out
in
spite
of
them
all
the
excellent
young
fellow
besought
me
to
keep
quiet
and
not
to
let
such
words
of
mine
be
heard
for
they
might
do
me
some
grave
injury
having
firm
confidence
in
god
it
was
my
duty
to
await
his
mercy
remaining
in
the
meanwhile
tranquil
i
answered
that
the
power
and
goodness
of
god
are
not
bound
to
stand
in
awe
before
the
malign
forces

iniquity

a

days
had

when
the

of
ferrara
arrived
in
rome
he
went
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
pope
and
the
pope
detained
him
up
to
now
the
pope
was
a
man
of
great
talent
for
affairs
and
he
wanted
to
talk
at
his
ease
with
the
cardinal
about
french
politics
everybody
knows
that
folk
when
they
are
feasting
together
say
things
which
they
would
otherwise
retain
this
therefore
happened
the
great
king
francis
was
most
frank
and
liberal
in
all
his
dealings
and
the
cardinal
was
well
acquainted
with
his
temper
therefore
the
latter
could
indulge
the
pope
beyond
his
boldest
expectations
this
raised
his
holiness
to
a
high
pitch
of
merriment
and
gladness
all
the
more
because
he
was
accustomed
to
drink
freely
once
a
week
and
went
indeed
to
vomit
after
his
indulgence
when
therefore
the
cardinal
observed
that
the
pope
was
well
disposed
and
ripe
to
grant
favours
he
begged
for
me
at
the
demand
pressing
the
matter
hotly
and
proving
that
his
majesty
had
it
much
at
heart
upon
this
the
pope
laughed
aloud
he
felt
the
moment
for
his
vomit
at
hand
the
excessive
quantity
of
wine
which
he
had
drunk
was
also
operating
so
he
said
the
spot
this
instant
you
shall
take
him
to
your
then
having
given
express
orders
to
this
purpose
he
rose
from
table
the
cardinal
immediately
sent
for
me
before
signor
pier
luigi
could
get
wind
of
the
affair
for
it
was
certain
that
he
would
not
have
allowed
me
to
be
loosed
from
prison
the
mandatary
came
together
with
two
great
gentlemen
of
the
and
when
four
of
the
night
was
passed
they
removed
me
from
my
prison
and
brought
me
into
the
presence
of
the
cardinal
who
received
me
with
indescribable
kindness
i
was
well
lodged
and
left
to
enjoy
the
comforts
of
my
situation
messer

the
old
brother
and
his
successor
in
the
office
insisted
on
extracting
from
me
the
costs
for
food
and
other
fees
and
perquisites
claimed
by
sheriffs
and
such
fry
paying
no
heed
to
his
will
in
my
behalf
this
affair
cost
me
several
scores
of
crowns
but
i
paid
them
because
the
cardinal
told
me
to
be
well
upon
my
guard
if
i
wanted
to
preserve
my
life
adding
that
had
he
not
extracted
me
that
evening
from
the
prison
i
should
never

bound
in
prison
to

those
who
best
deserved
it
least
i
spied
ah
could
you
know
what
rage
came
over
me
when
for
such
rogues
the
jail
relaxed
her
hold
this
makes
one
weep
that
one
was
born
to
be

no
more

become
fine
gold
such
gold
as
none
flings
lightly
to
the

for
the

shall
behold
another
point
hath
passed
into
my
mind
which
not
told
thee
luca
where
i
wrote
was
in
the
book
of
one
our
kith
and
kind
there
down
the
margins
i
was
wont
to
note
each
torment
grim
that
crushed
me
like
a
vice
the
paste
my
hurrying
thoughts
could
hardly
float
to
make
an
o
i
dipped
the
splinter
thrice
in
that
thick
mud
worse
woe
could
scarcely
grind

in
hell
debarred
from

seeing
not
the

by
fraud
confined
this
omit
and
once
more
seek
the
cell
wherein
i
rack
for
rage
both
heart
and
mind
i
praise
it
more
than
other
tongues
will
tell
and
for
advice
to
such
as
do
not
know
swear
that
without
it
none
can
labour
well
yet
oh
for
one
like
him
i
learned
but
now
cry
to
me
as
by
shore
take
thy
clothes
benvenuto
rise
and
go
credo
sing
salve
reginas

and
paternosters
alms
then
bestow
morn
after
morn
on
blind
folk
lame
and
poor
ah
me
how
many
a
time
my
cheek
must
grow
blanched
by
those
lilies
shall
i
then
forswear
florence
and
france
through
them
for
evermore
if
to
the
hospital
i
come
and
fair
find
the
annunziata
limned

else
shall
i
show
myself
a
brute
beast
there
these
words
flout
not
her
worshipped
sanctity
nor
those
her
lilies
glorious
holy
pure
the
which
illumine
earth
and
heaven
high
but
for
i
find
at
every
coign
obscure
base
lilies
which
spread
hooks
where
flowers
should
blow
needs
must
i
fear
lest
these
to
ruin
lure
to
think
how
many
walk
like
me
in
woe
born
what
how
slaved
to
serve
that
hateful
sign
souls
lively
graceful
like
to
gods
below
i
saw
that
lethal
heraldry
decline
from
heaven
like
lightning
among
people
vain
then
on
the
stone
i
saw
strange
lustre
shine
the
bell
must
break
ere
i
with
strain
thence
issued
and
these
things
who
speaketh
true
in
heaven
on
earth
to
me
made
wondrous
plain
next
i
beheld
a
bier
of
sombre
hue
adorned
with
broken
lilies
crosses
tears
and
on
their
beds
a
lost
crew
i
saw
the
death
who
racks
our
souls
with
fears
this
man
and
that
she
menaced
while
she
cried
clip
the
folk
who
harm
thee
with
these
shears
that
worthy
one
then
on
my
brow
wrote
wide
with
pen
words
he
bade
shun
to
speak
them
my
breast
i
hide
him
i
beheld
who
drives
and
checks
the
sun
clad
with
its
splendour
his
court
on
high
by
mortal
eyes
if
by
one
then
did
a
solitary
sparrow
cry
loud
from
the
keep
hearing
which
note
i
said
tells
that
i
shall
live
and
you
must
die
i
sang
and
wrote
my
hard
case
head
by
head
asking
from
god
pardon
and
aid
in
need
for
now
if
felt
mine
eyes
outworn
and
dead

or

that

down

on
the

did
that

dislodge
me
to
a

more
foul
more
cold

i
at

a

erst
my

unto
high
god
i
brought
beseeching
him
to
pardon
all
my
sin
and
spoke
a
miserere

when
i
gained
some
respite
from
that
din
of
troubles
and
had
given
my
soul
to
god

better

to

saw
along
the
path

saints
have
trod

descending

with

part
ii
i
i
remained
for
some
time
in
the
cardinal
of
palace
very
well
regarded
in
general
by
everybody
and
much
more
visited
even
than
i
had
previously
been
everybody
was
astonished
that
i
should
have
come
out
of
prison
and
have
been
able
to
live
through
such
indescribable
afflictions
and
while
i
was
recovering
my
breath
and
endeavouring
to
resume
the
habit
of
my
art
i
had
great
pleasure
in
the
capitolo
afterwards
with
a
view
to
my
strength
i
determined
to
take
a
journey
of
a
few
days
for
change
of
air
my
good
friend
the
cardinal
gave
me
permission
and
lent
me
horses
and
i
had
two
young
romans
for
my
companions
one
of
them
a
craftsman
in
my
trade
the
other
only
a
comrade
in
our
journey
we
left
rome
and
took
the
road
to
tagliacozzo
intending
to
visit
my
pupil
ascanio
who
lived
there
on
our
arrival
i
found
the
lad
together
with
his
father
brothers
sisters
and
stepmother
i
was
entertained
by
them
two
days
with
indescribable
kindness
then
i
turned
my
face
towards
rome
taking
ascanio
with
me
on
the
road
we
fell
to
conversing
about
our
art
which
made
me
die
of
impatience
to
get
back
and
recommence
my
labours
having
reached
rome
i
got
myself
at
once
in
readiness
to
work
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
again
a
silver
basin
which
i
had
begun
for
the
cardinal
before
i
was
imprisoned
together
with
this
basin
i
had
begun
a
very
beautiful
little
jug
but
this
had
been
stolen
with
a
great
quantity
of
other
valuable
articles
i
set
pagolo
whom
i
have
previously
mentioned
to
work
upon
the
basin
at
the
same
time
i
recommenced
the
jug
which
was
designed
with
round
figures
and
the
basin
was
executed
in
a
similar
style
with
round
figures
and
fishes
in
the
whole
had
such
richness
and
good
keeping
that
every
one
who
beheld
it
expressed
astonishment
at
the
force
of
the
design
and
beauty
of
invention
and
also
at
the
delicacy
with
which
these
young
men
worked
the
cardinal
came
at
least
twice
a
day
to
see
me
bringing
with
him
messer
luigi
alamanni
and
messer
gabriel
cesano
and
here
we
used
to
pass
an
hour
or
two
pleasantly
together
notwithstanding
i
had
very
much
to
do
he
kept
giving
me
fresh
commissions
among
others
i
had
to
make
his
pontifical
seal
of
the
size
of
the
hand
of
a
boy
of
twelve
on
it
i
engraved
in
intaglio
two
little
histories
the
one
of
san
giovanni
preaching
in
the
wilderness
the
other
of
ambrogio
expelling
the
arians
on
horseback
with
a
lash
in
his
hand
the
fire
and
correctness
of
design
of
this
piece
and
its
nicety
of
workmanship
made
every
one
say
that
i
had
surpassed
the
great
lautizio
who
ranked
alone
in
this
branch
of
the
profession
the
cardinal
was
so
proud
of
it
that
he
used
to
compare
it
complacently
with
the
other
seals
of
the
roman
cardinals
which
were
nearly
all
from
the
hand
of
lautizio
note
this
assertion
is
well
supported
by
contemporary
letters
of
caro
and
alamanni
note
this
indicates
precision
neatness
cleanness
of
execution
note
the
name
of
cesano
is
well
known
in
the
literary
correspondence
of
those
times
note
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
cardinal
was
archbishop
of
milan
ii
in
addition
to
these
things
the
cardinal
ordered
me
to
make
the
model
for
a
but
he
said
he
should
like
me
to
leave
the
beaten
track
pursued
by
such
as
fabricated
these
things
messer
luigi
apropos
of
this
made
an
eloquent
description
of
his
own
idea
messer
gabriello
cesano
also
spoke
exceedingly
well
to
the
same
purpose
the
cardinal
who
was
a
very
kindly
listener
showed
extreme
satisfaction
with
the
designs
which
these
two
able
men
of
letters
had
described
in
words
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
benvenuto
the
design
of
messer
luigi
and
that
of
messer
gabriello
please
me
both
so
well
that
i
know
not
how
to
choose
between
them
therefore
i
leave
the
choice
to
you
who
will
have
to
execute
the
i
replied
as
follows
is
apparent
my
lords
of
what
vast
consequence
are
the
sons
of
kings
and
emperors
and
what
a
marvellous
brightness
of
divinity
appears
in
them
nevertheless
if
you
ask
some
poor
humble
shepherd
which
he
loves
best
those
royal
children
or
his
sons
he
will
certainly
tell
you
that
he
loves
his
own
sons
best
now
i
too
have
a
great
affection
for
the
children
which
i
bring
forth
from
my
art
consequently
the
first
which
i
will
show
you
most
reverend
monsignor
my
good
master
shall
be
of
my
own
making
and
invention
there
are
many
things
beautiful
enough
in
words
which
do
not
match
together
well
when
executed
by
an
then
i
turned
to
the
two
scholars
and
said
have
spoken
i
will
upon
this
messer
luigi
alamanni
smiled
and
added
a
great
many
witty
things
with
the
greatest
charm
of
manner
in
my
praise
they
became
him
well
for
he
was
handsome
of
face
and
figure
and
had
a
gentle
voice
messer
gabriello
cesano
was
quite
the
opposite
as
ugly
and
displeasing
as
the
other
was
agreeable
accordingly
he
spoke
as
he
looked
messer
luigi
had
suggested
that
i
should
fashion
a
venus
with
cupid
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
pretty
emblems
all
in
proper
keeping
with
the
subject
messer
gabriello
proposed
that
i
should
model
an
amphitrite
the
wife
of
neptune
together
with
those
tritons
of
the
sea
and
many
fancies
good
enough
to
describe
in
words
but
not
to
execute
in
metal
i
first
laid
down
an
oval
framework
considerably
longer
than
half
a
cubit
almost
in
fact
and
upon
this
ground
wishing
to
suggest
the
interminglement
of
land
and
ocean
i
modelled
two
figures
considerably
taller
than
a
palm
in
height
which
were
seated
with
their
legs
interlaced
suggesting
those
lengthier
branches
of
the
sea
which
run
up
into
the
continents
the
sea
was
a
man
and
in
his
hand
i
placed
a
ship
elaborately
wrought
in
all
its
details
and
well
adapted
to
hold
a
quantity
of
salt
beneath
him
i
grouped
the
four
and
in
his
right
hand
he
held
his
trident
the
earth
i
fashioned
like
a
woman
with
all
the
beauty
of
form
the
grace
and
charm
of
which
my
art
was
capable
she
had
a
richly
decorated
temple
firmly
based
upon
the
ground
at
one
side
and
here
her
hand
rested
this
i
intended
to
receive
the
pepper
in
her
other
hand
i
put
a
cornucopia
overflowing
with
all
the
natural
treasures
i
could
think
of
below
this
goddess
in
the
part
which
represented
earth
i
collected
the
fairest
animals
that
haunt
our
globe
in
the
quarter
presided
over
by
the
deity
of
ocean
i
fashioned
such
choice
kinds
of
fishes
and
shells
as
could
be
properly
displayed
in
that
small
space
what
remained
of
the
oval
i
filled
in
with
luxuriant
ornamentation
then
i
waited
for
the
cardinal
and
when
he
came
attended
by
the
two
accomplished
gentlemen
i
produced
the
model
i
had
made
in
wax
on
beholding
it
messer
gabriel
cesano
was
the
first
to
lift
his
voice
up
and
to
cry
is
a
piece
which
it
will
take
the
lives
of
ten
men
to
finish
do
not
expect
most
reverend
monsignor
if
you
order
it
to
get
it
in
your
lifetime
benvenuto
it
seems
has
chosen
to
display
his
children
in
a
vision
but
not
to
give
them
to
the
touch
as
we
did
when
we
spoke
of
things
that
could
be
carried
out
while
he
has
shown
a
thing
beyond
the
bounds
of
messer
alamanni
took
my
side
but
the
cardinal
said
he
did
not
care
to
undertake
so
important
an
affair
then
i
turned
to
them
and
said
reverend
monsignor
and
you
gentlemen
fulfilled
with
learning
i
tell
you
that
i
hope
to
complete
this
piece
for
whosoever
shall
be
destined
to
possess
it
and
each
one
of
you
shall
live
to
i
see
it
executed
a
hundred
times
more
richly
than
the
model
indeed
i
hope
that
time
will
be
left
me
to
produce
far
greater
things
than
the
cardinal
replied
in
heat
you
make
if
for
the
king
to
whom
i
mean
to
take
you
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
make
it
for
another
man
then
he
showed
me
letters
in
which
the
king
under
one
heading
bade
him
return
as
soon
as
possible
bringing
benvenuto
with
him
at
this
i
raised
my
hands
to
heaven
exclaiming
when
will
that
moment
come
and
quickly
the
cardinal
bade
me
put
myself
in
readiness
and
arrange
the
affairs
i
had
in
rome
he
gave
me
ten
days
for
these
preparations
note
chi
avere
for
whomsoever
it
in
going
to
belong
to
iii
when
the
time
came
to
travel
he
gave
me
a
fine
and
excellent
horse
the
animal
was
called
tornon
because
it
was
a
gift
from
the
cardinal
tornon
my
apprentices
pagolo
and
ascanio
were
also
furnished
with
good
mounts
the
cardinal
divided
his
household
which
was
very
numerous
into
two
sections
the
first
and
the
more
distinguished
he
took
with
him
following
the
route
of
romagna
with
the
object
of
visiting
madonna
del
loreto
and
then
making
for
ferrara
his
own
home
the
other
section
he
sent
upon
the
road
to
florence
this
was
the
larger
train
it
counted
a
great
multitude
including
the
flower
of
his
horse
he
told
me
that
if
i
wished
to
make
the
journey
without
peril
i
had
better
go
with
him
otherwise
i
ran
some
risk
of
my
life
i
expressed
my
inclination
to
his
most
reverend
lordship
to
travel
in
his
suite
but
having
done
so
since
the
will
of
heaven
must
be
accomplished
it
pleased
god
to
remind
me
of
my
poor
sister
who
had
suffered
greatly
from
the
news
of
my
misfortunes
i
also
remembered
my
cousins
who
were
nuns
in
viterbo
the
one
abbess
and
the
other
camerlinga
and
who
had
therefore
that
rich
convent
under
their
control
they
too
had
endured
sore
tribulation
for
my
sake
and
to
their
fervent
prayers
i
firmly
believed
that
i
owed
the
grace
of
my
deliverance
by
god
accordingly
when
these
things
came
into
my
mind
i
decided
for
the
route
to
florence
i
might
have
travelled
free
of
expense
with
the
cardinal
or
with
that
other
train
of
his
but
i
chose
to
take
my
own
way
by
myself
eventually
i
joined
company
with
a
very
famous
clockmaker
called
maestro
cherubino
my
esteemed
friend
thrown
together
by
accident
we
performed
the
journey
with
much
enjoyment
on
both
sides
i
had
left
rome
on
monday
in
passion
week
together
with
pagolo
and
ascanio
at
monte
ruosi
we
joined
the
company
which
i
have
mentioned
since
i
had
expressed
my
intention
of
following
the
cardinal
i
did
not
anticipate
that
any
of
my
enemies
would
be
upon
the
watch
to
harm
me
yet
i
ran
a
narrow
risk
of
coming
to
grief
at
monte
ruosi
for
a
band
of
men
had
been
sent
forward
well
armed
to
do
me
mischief
there
it
was
so
ordained
by
god
that
while
we
were
at
dinner
these
fellows
on
the
news
that
i
was
not
travelling
in
the
suite
made
preparation
to
attack
me
just
at
that
moment
the
retinue
arrived
and
i
was
glad
enough
to
travel
with
their
escort
safely
to
viterbo
from
that
place
onward
i
had
no
apprehension
of
danger
especially
as
i
made
a
point
of
travelling
a
few
miles
in
front
and
the
best
men
of
the
retinue
kept
a
good
watch
over
me
i
arrived
by
grace
safe
and
sound
at
viterbo
where
my
cousins
and
all
the
convent
received
me
with
the
greatest
kindness
note
this
was
the
famous
françois
de
tournon
made
cardinal
in
and
employed
as
minister
by
françois
i
note
this
official
in
a
convent
was
the
same
as
cellarer
or
superintendent
of
the
cellar
and
provisions
note
this
was
march
note
molto
conto
di
me
this
is
perhaps
equivalent
to
me
in
high
esteem
but
cellini
uses
the
same
phrase
with
the
meaning
i
have
given
above
in
book
i
chap
lxxxvi
iv
i
bought
a
new
pair
of
stirrups
although
i
still
hoped
to
regain
my
good
pad
by
persuasion
and
since
i
was
very
well
mounted
and
well
armed
with
shirt
and
sleeves
of
mail
and
carried
an
excellent
arquebuse
upon
my
i
was
not
afraid
of
the
brutality
and
violence
which
that
mad
beast
was
said
to
be
possessed
of
i
had
also
accustomed
my
young
men
to
carry
shirts
of
mail
and
had
great
confidence
in
the
roman
who
while
we
were
in
rome
together
had
never
left
it
off
so
far
as
i
could
see
ascanio
too
although
he
was
but
a
stripling
was
in
the
habit
of
wearing
one
besides
as
it
was
good
friday
i
imagined
that
the
madnesses
of
madmen
might
be
giving
themselves
a
holiday
when
we
came
to
the
camollia
gate
i
at
once
recognised
the
postmaster
by
the
indications
given
me
for
he
was
blind
of
the
left
eye
riding
up
to
him
then
and
leaving
my
young
men
and
companions
at
a
little
distance
i
courteously
addressed
him
of
the
post
if
i
assure
you
that
i
did
not
override
your
horse
why
are
you
unwilling
to
give
me
back
my
pad
and
stirrups
the
reply
he
made
was
precisely
as
mad
and
brutal
as
had
been
foretold
me
this
roused
me
to
exclaim
then
are
you
not
a
christian
or
do
you
want
upon
good
friday
to
force
us
both
into
a
scandal
he
answered
that
good
friday
or
the
friday
was
all
the
same
to
him
and
that
if
i
did
not
take
myself
away
he
would
fell
me
to
the
ground
with
a
spontoon
which
he
had
taken
up
me
and
the
arquebuse
i
had
my
hand
on
upon
hearing
these
truculent
words
an
old
gentleman
of
siena
joined
us
he
was
dressed
like
a
citizen
and
was
returning
from
the
religious
functions
proper
to
that
day
it
seems
that
he
had
gathered
the
sense
of
my
arguments
before
he
came
up
to
where
we
stood
and
this
impelled
him
to
rebuke
the
postmaster
with
warmth
taking
my
side
and
reprimanding
the
two
sons
for
not
doing
their
duty
to
passing
strangers
so
that
their
manners
were
an
offence
to
god
and
a
disgrace
to
the
city
of
siena
the
two
young
fellows
wagged
their
heads
without
saying
a
word
and
withdrew
inside
the
house
their
father
stung
to
fury
by
the
scolding
of
that
respectable
gentleman
poured
out
a
volley
of
abusive
blasphemies
and
levelled
his
spontoon
swearing
he
would
murder
me
when
i
saw
him
determined
to
do
some
act
of
bestial
violence
i
pointed
the
muzzle
of
my
arquebuse
with
the
object
only
of
keeping
him
at
a
distance
doubly
enraged
by
this
he
flung
himself
upon
me
though
i
had
prepared
the
arquebuse
for
my
defence
i
had
not
yet
levelled
it
exactly
at
him
indeed
it
was
pointed
too
high
it
went
off
of
itself
and
the
ball
striking
the
arch
of
the
door
and
glancing
backwards
wounded
him
in
the
throat
so
that
he
fell
dead
to
earth
upon
this
the
two
young
men
came
running
out
one
caught
up
a
partisan
from
the
rack
which
stood
there
the
other
seized
the
spontoon
of
his
father
springing
upon
my
followers
the
one
who
had
the
spontoon
smote
pagolo
the
roman
first
above
the
left
nipple
the
other
attacked
a
milanese
who
was
in
our
company
and
had
the
ways
and
manners
of
a
perfect
fool
this
man
screamed
out
that
he
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
me
and
parried
the
point
of
the
partisan
with
a
little
stick
he
held
but
this
availed
him
naught
in
spite
of
his
words
and
fencing
he
received
a
flesh
wound
in
the
mouth
messer
cherubino
wore
the
habit
of
a
priest
for
though
he
was
a
clockmaker
by
trade
he
held
benefices
of
some
value
from
the
pope
ascanio
who
was
well
armed
stood
his
ground
without
trying
to
escape
as
the
milanese
had
done
so
these
two
came
off
unhurt
i
had
set
spurs
to
my
horse
and
while
he
was
galloping
had
charged
and
got
my
arquebuse
in
readiness
again
but
now
i
turned
back
burning
with
fury
and
meaning
to
play
my
part
this
time
in
earnest
i
thought
that
my
young
men
had
been
killed
and
was
resolved
to
die
with
them
the
horse
had
not
gone
many
paces
when
i
met
them
riding
toward
me
and
asked
if
they
were
hurt
ascanio
answered
that
pagolo
was
wounded
to
the
death
then
i
said
pagolo
my
son
did
the
spontoon
then
pierce
through
your
armour
he
replied
i
put
my
shirt
of
mail
in
the
valise
this
then
i
suppose
one
wears
in
rome
to
swagger
before
ladies
but
where
there
is
danger
and
one
wants
it
one
keeps
it
locked
up
in
a
portmanteau
you
deserve
what
you
have
got
and
you
are
now
the
cause
of
sending
me
back
to
die
here
while
i
was
uttering
these
words
i
kept
riding
briskly
onward
but
both
the
young
men
implored
me
for
the
love
of
god
to
save
myself
and
them
and
not
to
rush
on
certain
death
just
then
i
met
messer
cherubino
and
the
wounded
milanese
the
former
cried
out
that
no
one
was
badly
wounded
the
blow
given
to
pagolo
had
only
grazed
the
skin
but
the
old
postmaster
was
stretched
out
dead
his
sons
with
other
folk
were
getting
ready
for
attack
and
we
must
almost
certainly
be
cut
to
pieces
benvenuto
since
fortune
has
saved
us
from
this
first
tempest
do
not
tempt
her
again
for
things
may
not
go
so
favourably
a
second
to
this
i
replied
you
are
satisfied
to
have
it
thus
so
also
am
i
and
turning
to
pagolo
and
ascanio
i
said
spurs
to
your
horses
and
let
us
gallop
to
staggia
without
stopping
there
we
shall
be
in
the
wounded
milanese
groaned
out
pox
upon
our
peccadilloes
the
sole
cause
of
my
misfortune
was
that
i
sinned
by
taking
a
little
broth
this
morning
having
nothing
else
to
break
my
fast
in
spite
of
the
great
peril
we
were
in
we
could
not
help
laughing
a
little
at
the
donkey
and
his
silly
speeches
then
we
set
spurs
to
our
horses
and
left
messer
cherubino
and
the
milanese
to
follow
at
their
leisure
note
the
word
i
have
translated
by
above
is
in
the
original
it
seems
to
have
been
a
sort
of
cushion
flung
upon
the
saddle
and
to
which
the
stirrups
were
attached
note
the
italian
is
peculiar
colpo
di
pagolo
era
ito
tanto
ritto
che
non
era
isfandato
note
staggia
is
the
next
post
on
the
way
to
florence
v
while
we
were
making
our
escape
the
sons
of
the
dead
man
ran
to
the
duke
of
melfi
and
begged
for
some
light
horsemen
to
catch
us
up
and
take
us
prisoners
the
duke
upon
being
informed
that
we
were
the
cardinal
of
men
refused
to
give
them
troops
or
leave
to
follow
we
meanwhile
arrived
at
staggia
where
we
were
in
safety
there
we
sent
for
a
doctor
the
best
who
could
be
had
in
such
a
place
and
on
his
examining
pagolo
we
discovered
that
the
wound
was
only
so
i
felt
sure
that
he
would
escape
without
mischief
then
we
ordered
dinner
and
at
this
juncture
there
arrived
messer
cherubino
and
that
milanese
simpleton
who
kept
always
muttering
plague
upon
your
quarrels
and
complaining
that
he
was
excommunicated
because
he
had
not
been
able
to
say
a
single
paternoster
on
that
holy
morning
he
was
very
ugly
and
his
mouth
which
nature
had
made
large
had
been
expanded
at
least
three
inches
by
his
wound
so
that
what
with
his
ludicrous
milanese
jargon
and
his
silly
way
of
talking
he
gave
us
so
much
matter
for
mirth
that
instead
of
bemoaning
our
we
could
not
hold
from
laughing
at
every
word
he
uttered
when
the
doctor
wanted
to
sew
up
his
wound
and
had
already
made
three
stitches
with
his
needle
the
fellow
told
him
to
hold
hard
a
while
since
he
did
not
want
him
out
of
malice
to
sew
his
whole
mouth
up
then
he
took
up
a
spoon
and
said
he
wished
to
have
his
mouth
left
open
enough
to
take
that
spoon
in
in
order
that
he
might
return
alive
to
his
own
folk
these
things
he
said
with
such
odd
waggings
of
the
head
that
we
never
stopped
from
laughing
and
so
pursued
our
journey
mirthfully
to
florence
we
dismounted
at
the
house
of
my
poor
sister
who
together
with
her
husband
overwhelmed
us
with
kind
attentions
messer
cherubino
and
the
milanese
went
about
their
business
in
florence
we
remained
four
days
during
which
pagolo
got
well
it
was
lucky
for
us
that
whenever
we
talked
about
that
milanese
donkey
we
laughed
as
much
as
our
misfortunes
made
us
weep
so
that
we
kept
laughing
and
crying
both
at
the
same
moment
pagolo
recovered
as
i
have
said
with
ease
and
then
we
travelled
toward
ferrara
where
we
found
our
lord
the
cardinal
had
not
yet
arrived
he
had
already
heard
of
all
our
accidents
and
said
when
he
expressed
his
concern
for
them
pray
to
god
that
i
may
be
allowed
to
bring
you
alive
to
the
king
according
to
my
in
ferrara
he
sent
me
to
reside
at
a
palace
of
his
a
very
handsome
place
called
belfiore
close
under
the
city
walls
there
he
provided
me
with
all
things
necessary
for
my
work
a
little
later
he
arranged
to
leave
for
france
without
me
and
observing
that
i
was
very
ill
pleased
with
this
he
said
to
me
i
am
acting
for
your
welfare
before
i
take
you
out
of
italy
i
want
you
to
know
exactly
what
you
will
have
to
do
when
you
come
to
france
meanwhile
push
on
my
basin
and
the
jug
with
all
the
speed
you
can
i
shall
leave
orders
with
my
factor
to
give
you
everything
that
you
may
he
then
departed
and
i
remained
sorely
dissatisfied
and
more
than
once
i
was
upon
the
point
of
taking
myself
off
without
license
the
only
thing
which
kept
me
back
was
that
he
had
procured
my
freedom
from
pope
paolo
for
the
rest
i
was
and
put
to
considerable
losses
however
i
clothed
my
mind
with
the
gratitude
due
to
that
great
benefit
and
disposed
myself
to
be
patient
and
to
await
the
termination
of
the
business
so
i
set
myself
to
work
with
my
two
men
and
made
great
progress
with
the
jug
and
basin
the
air
was
unwholesome
where
we
lodged
and
toward
summer
we
all
of
us
suffered
somewhat
in
our
health
during
our
indisposition
we
went
about
inspecting
the
domain
it
was
very
large
and
left
in
a
wild
state
for
about
a
mile
of
open
ground
haunted
too
by
multitudes
of
peacocks
which
bred
and
nested
there
like
wildfowl
this
put
it
into
my
head
to
charge
my
gun
with
a
noiseless
kind
of
powder
then
i
tracked
some
of
the
young
birds
and
every
other
day
killed
one
which
furnished
us
with
abundance
of
meat
of
such
excellent
quality
that
we
shook
our
sickness
off
for
several
months
following
we
went
on
working
merrily
and
got
the
jug
and
basin
forward
but
it
was
a
task
that
required
much
time
note
the
duke
of
melfi
or
amalfi
was
at
this
time
alfonso
piccolomini
acting
as
of
the
sienese
in
the
interests
of
charles
note
the
subject
to
this
verb
may
be
either
cellini
or
the
doctor
vi
at
that
period
the
duke
of
ferrara
came
to
terms
with
pope
paul
about
some
old
matters
in
dispute
between
them
relating
to
modena
and
certain
other
cities
the
church
having
a
strong
claim
to
them
the
duke
was
forced
to
purchase
peace
by
paying
down
an
enormous
sum
of
money
i
think
that
it
exceeded
three
hundred
thousand
ducats
of
the
camera
there
was
an
old
treasurer
in
the
service
of
the
duke
who
had
been
brought
up
by
his
father
duke
alfonso
and
was
called
messer
girolamo
giliolo
he
could
not
endure
to
see
so
much
money
going
to
the
pope
and
went
about
the
streets
crying
alfonso
his
father
would
sooner
have
attacked
and
taken
rome
with
this
money
than
have
shown
it
to
the
nothing
would
induce
him
to
disburse
it
at
last
however
the
duke
compelled
him
to
make
the
payments
which
caused
the
old
man
such
anguish
that
he
sickened
of
a
dangerous
colic
and
was
brought
to
door
during
this
illness
the
duke
sent
for
me
and
bade
me
take
his
portrait
this
i
did
upon
a
circular
piece
of
black
stone
about
the
size
of
a
little
trencher
the
duke
took
so
much
pleasure
in
my
work
and
conversation
that
he
not
unfrequently
posed
through
four
or
five
hours
at
a
stretch
for
his
own
portrait
and
sometimes
invited
me
to
supper
it
took
me
eight
days
to
complete
his
likeness
then
he
ordered
me
to
design
the
reverse
on
it
i
modelled
peace
giving
her
the
form
of
a
woman
with
a
torch
in
her
hand
setting
fire
to
a
trophy
of
arms
i
portrayed
her
in
an
attitude
of
gladness
with
very
thin
drapery
and
below
her
feet
lay
fury
in
despair
downcast
and
sad
and
loaded
with
chains
i
devoted
much
study
and
attention
to
this
work
and
it
won
me
the
greatest
honour
the
duke
was
never
tired
of
expressing
his
satisfaction
and
gave
me
inscriptions
for
both
sides
of
the
medal
that
on
the
reverse
ran
as
follows
in
conspectu
domini
it
meant
that
his
peace
with
the
pope
had
been
dearly
bought
vii
while
i
was
still
engaged
upon
the
reverse
of
this
medal
the
cardinal
sent
me
letters
bidding
me
prepare
for
my
journey
since
the
king
had
asked
after
me
his
next
communication
would
contain
full
details
respecting
all
that
he
had
promised
accordingly
i
had
my
jug
and
basin
packed
up
after
showing
them
to
the
duke
now
a
ferrarese
gentleman
named
alberto
bendedio
was
the
agent
and
he
had
been
twelve
years
confined
to
his
house
without
once
leaving
it
by
reason
of
some
physical
infirmity
one
day
he
sent
in
a
vast
hurry
for
me
saying
i
must
take
the
post
at
once
in
order
to
present
myself
before
the
king
of
france
who
had
eagerly
been
asking
for
me
under
the
impression
that
i
was
in
france
by
way
of
apology
the
cardinal
told
him
that
i
was
staying
slightly
indisposed
in
his
abbey
at
lyons
but
that
he
would
have
me
brought
immediately
to
his
majesty
therefore
i
must
lose
no
time
but
travel
with
the
post
now
messer
alberto
was
a
man
of
sterling
worth
but
proud
and
illness
had
made
his
haughty
temper
insupportable
as
i
have
just
said
he
bade
me
to
get
ready
on
the
spot
and
take
the
journey
by
the
common
post
i
said
that
it
was
not
the
custom
to
pursue
my
profession
in
the
post
and
that
if
i
had
to
go
it
was
my
intention
to
make
easy
stages
and
to
take
with
me
the
workmen
ascanio
and
pagolo
whom
i
had
brought
from
rome
moreover
i
wanted
a
servant
on
horseback
to
be
at
my
orders
and
money
sufficient
for
my
costs
upon
the
way
the
infirm
old
man
replied
upon
a
tone
of
mighty
haughtiness
that
the
sons
of
dukes
were
wont
to
travel
as
i
had
described
and
in
no
other
fashion
i
retorted
that
the
sons
of
my
art
travelled
in
the
way
i
had
informed
him
and
that
not
being
a
son
i
knew
nothing
about
the
customs
of
such
folk
if
he
treated
me
to
language
with
which
my
ears
were
unfamiliar
i
would
not
go
at
all
the
cardinal
having
broken
faith
with
me
and
such
scurvy
words
having
been
spoken
i
should
make
my
mind
up
once
for
all
to
take
no
further
trouble
with
the
ferrarese
then
i
turned
my
back
and
he
threatening
i
grumbling
took
my
leave
i
next
went
to
the
duke
with
my
medal
which
was
finished
he
received
me
with
the
highest
marks
of
honour
and
esteem
it
seems
that
he
had
given
orders
to
messer
girolamo
giliolo
to
reward
me
for
my
labour
with
a
diamond
ring
worth
two
hundred
crowns
which
was
to
be
presented
by
fiaschino
his
chamberlain
accordingly
this
fellow
on
the
evening
after
i
had
brought
the
medal
at
one
hour
past
nightfall
handed
me
a
ring
with
a
diamond
of
showy
appearance
and
spoke
as
follows
on
the
part
of
his
master
this
diamond
as
a
remembrance
of
his
excellency
to
adorn
the
unique
hand
which
has
produced
a
masterpiece
of
so
singular
when
day
broke
i
examined
the
ring
and
found
the
stone
to
be
a
miserable
thin
diamond
worth
about
ten
crowns
i
felt
sure
that
the
duke
had
not
meant
to
accompany
such
magnificent
compliments
with
so
trifling
a
gift
but
that
he
must
have
intended
to
reward
me
handsomely
being
then
convinced
that
the
trick
proceeded
from
his
rogue
of
a
treasurer
i
gave
the
ring
to
a
friend
of
mine
begging
him
to
return
it
to
the
chamberlain
fiaschino
as
he
best
could
the
man
i
chose
was
bernardo
saliti
who
executed
his
commission
admirably
fiaschino
came
at
once
to
see
me
and
declared
with
vehement
expostulations
that
the
duke
would
take
it
very
ill
if
i
refused
a
present
he
had
meant
so
kindly
perhaps
i
should
have
to
repent
of
my
waywardness
i
answered
that
the
ring
his
excellency
had
given
me
was
worth
about
ten
crowns
and
that
the
work
i
had
done
for
him
was
worth
more
than
two
hundred
wishing
however
to
show
his
excellency
how
highly
i
esteemed
his
courtesy
i
should
be
happy
if
he
bestowed
on
me
only
one
of
those
rings
for
the
cramp
which
come
from
england
and
are
worth
tenpence
i
would
treasure
that
so
long
as
i
lived
in
remembrance
of
his
excellency
together
with
the
honourable
message
he
had
sent
me
for
i
considered
that
the
splendid
favours
of
his
excellency
had
amply
recompensed
my
pains
whereas
that
paltry
stone
insulted
them
this
speech
annoyed
the
duke
so
much
that
he
sent
for
his
treasurer
and
scolded
him
more
sharply
than
he
had
ever
done
before
at
the
same
time
he
gave
me
orders
under
pain
of
his
displeasure
not
to
leave
ferrara
without
duly
informing
him
and
commanded
the
treasurer
to
present
me
with
a
diamond
up
to
three
hundred
crowns
in
value
the
miserly
official
found
a
stone
rising
a
trifle
above
sixty
crowns
and
let
it
be
heard
that
it
was
worth
upwards
of
two
hundred
note
del
granchio
a
metal
ring
of
lead
and
copper
such
as
are
now
worn
in
italy
under
the
name
of
di
salute
viii
meanwhile
messer
alberto
returned
to
reason
and
provided
me
with
all
i
had
demanded
my
mind
was
made
up
to
quit
ferrara
without
fail
that
very
day
but
the
attentive
chamberlain
arranged
with
messer
alberto
that
i
should
get
no
horses
then
i
had
loaded
a
mule
with
my
baggage
including
the
case
which
held
the
jug
and
basin
just
then
a
ferrarese
nobleman
named
messer
alfonso
trotti
arrived
he
was
far
advanced
in
years
and
a
person
of
excessive
affectation
a
great
dilettante
of
the
arts
but
one
of
those
men
who
are
very
difficult
to
satisfy
and
who
if
they
chance
to
stumble
on
something
which
suits
their
taste
exalt
it
so
in
their
own
fancy
that
they
never
expect
to
see
the
like
of
it
again
well
this
messer
alonso
arrived
and
messer
alberto
said
to
him
am
sorry
that
you
are
come
so
late
the
jug
and
basin
we
are
sending
to
the
cardinal
in
france
have
been
already
he
answered
that
it
did
not
signify
to
him
and
beckoning
to
his
servant
sent
him
home
to
fetch
a
jug
in
white
faenzo
clay
the
workmanship
of
which
was
very
exquisite
during
the
time
the
servant
took
to
go
and
return
messer
alfonso
said
to
messer
alberto
will
tell
you
why
i
do
not
care
any
longer
to
look
at
vases
it
is
that
i
once
beheld
a
piece
of
silver
antique
of
such
beauty
and
such
finish
that
the
human
imagination
can
not
possibly
conceive
its
rarity
therefore
i
would
rather
not
inspect
any
objects
of
the
kind
for
fear
of
spoiling
the
unique
impression
i
retain
of
that
i
must
tell
you
that
a
gentleman
of
great
quality
and
accomplishments
who
went
to
rome
upon
matters
of
business
had
this
antique
vase
shown
to
him
in
secret
by
adroitly
using
a
large
sum
of
money
he
bribed
the
person
in
whose
hands
it
was
and
brought
it
with
him
to
these
parts
but
he
keeps
it
jealously
from
all
eyes
in
order
that
the
duke
may
not
get
wind
of
it
fearing
he
should
in
some
way
be
deprived
of
his
while
spinning
out
this
lengthy
yarn
messer
alfonso
did
not
look
at
me
because
we
were
not
previously
acquainted
but
when
that
precious
clay
model
appeared
he
displayed
it
with
such
airs
of
ostentation
pomp
and
mountebank
ceremony
that
after
inspecting
it
i
turned
to
messer
alberto
and
said
am
indeed
lucky
to
have
had
the
privilege
to
see
it
messer
alfonso
quite
affronted
let
some
contemptuous
words
escape
him
and
exclaimed
are
you
then
you
who
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
i
replied
for
a
moment
and
afterwards
judge
which
of
us
knows
best
what
he
is
then
turning
to
messer
alberto
who
was
a
man
of
great
gravity
and
talent
i
began
is
a
copy
from
a
little
silver
goblet
of
such
and
such
weight
which
i
made
at
such
and
such
a
time
for
that
charlatan
maestro
jacopo
the
surgeon
from
carpi
he
came
to
rome
and
spent
six
months
there
during
which
he
bedaubed
some
scores
of
nobleman
and
unfortunate
gentlefolk
with
his
dirty
salves
extracting
many
thousands
of
ducats
from
their
pockets
at
that
time
i
made
for
him
this
vase
and
one
of
a
different
pattern
he
paid
me
very
badly
and
at
the
present
moment
in
rome
all
the
miserable
people
who
used
his
ointment
are
crippled
and
in
a
deplorable
state
of
health
it
is
indeed
great
glory
for
me
that
my
works
are
held
in
such
repute
among
you
wealthy
lords
but
i
can
assure
you
that
during
these
many
years
past
i
have
been
progressing
in
my
art
with
all
my
might
and
i
think
that
the
vase
i
am
taking
with
me
into
france
is
far
more
worthy
of
cardinals
and
kings
than
that
piece
belonging
to
your
little
quack
after
i
had
made
this
speech
messer
alfonso
seemed
dying
with
desire
to
see
the
jug
and
basin
but
i
refused
to
open
the
box
we
remained
some
while
disputing
the
matter
when
he
said
that
he
would
go
to
the
duke
and
get
an
order
from
his
excellency
to
have
it
shown
him
then
messer
alberto
bendedio
in
the
high
and
mighty
manner
which
belonged
to
him
exclaimed
you
leave
this
room
messer
alfonso
you
shall
see
it
without
employing
the
on
hearing
these
words
i
took
my
leave
and
left
ascanio
and
pagolo
to
show
it
they
told
me
afterwards
that
he
had
spoken
enthusiastically
in
my
praise
after
this
he
wanted
to
become
better
acquainted
with
me
but
i
was
wearying
to
leave
ferrara
and
get
away
from
all
its
folk
the
only
advantages
i
had
enjoyed
there
were
the
society
of
cardinal
salviati
and
the
cardinal
of
ravenna
and
the
friendship
of
some
ingenious
musicians
no
one
else
had
been
to
me
of
any
good
for
the
ferrarese
are
a
very
avaricious
people
greedy
of
their
money
however
they
may
lay
their
hands
on
it
they
are
all
the
same
in
this
respect
at
the
hour
of
fiaschino
arrived
and
gave
me
the
diamond
of
sixty
crowns
of
which
i
spoke
above
he
told
me
with
a
look
and
a
few
brief
words
that
i
might
wear
it
for
his
sake
i
replied
will
do
then
putting
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
in
his
presence
i
set
off
upon
my
travels
without
further
the
man
noted
down
my
act
and
words
and
reported
them
to
the
duke
who
was
highly
incensed
and
showed
a
strong
inclination
to
make
me
retrace
my
steps
note
this
man
was
a
member
of
a
very
noble
ferrarese
family
and
much
esteemed
for
his
official
talents

i
think
cellini
probably
meant
to
hint
that
he
had
seen
it
before
note
see
above
book
for
this
story
note
cardinal
giovanni
salviati
was
archbishop
of
ferrara
cardinal
benedetto
accolti
archbishop
of
ravenna
was
then
staying
at
ferrara
the
court
was
famous
for
its
excellent
orchestra
and
theatrical
display
of
all
kinds
ix
that
evening
i
rode
more
than
ten
miles
always
at
a
trot
and
when
upon
the
next
day
i
found
myself
outside
the
ferrarese
domain
i
felt
excessively
relieved
indeed
i
had
met
with
nothing
to
my
liking
there
except
those
peacocks
which
restored
my
health
we
journeyed
by
the
monsanese
avoiding
the
city
of
milan
on
account
of
the
apprehension
i
have
spoken
of
so
that
we
arrived
safe
and
sound
at
lyons
counting
pagolo
and
ascanio
and
a
servant
we
were
four
men
with
four
very
good
horses
at
lyons
we
waited
several
days
for
the
muleteer
who
carried
the
silver
cup
and
basin
as
well
as
our
other
baggage
our
lodging
was
in
an
abbey
of
the
when
the
muleteer
arrived
we
loaded
all
our
goods
upon
a
little
cart
and
then
set
off
toward
paris
on
the
road
we
met
with
some
annoyances
but
not
of
any
great
moment
we
found
the
court
of
the
king
at
fontana
beliň
there
we
presented
ourselves
to
the
cardinal
who
provided
us
at
once
with
lodgings
and
that
evening
we
were
comfortable
on
the
following
day
the
cart
turned
up
so
we
unpacked
our
things
and
when
the
cardinal
heard
this
he
told
the
king
who
expressed
a
wish
to
see
me
at
once
i
went
to
his
majesty
with
the
cup
and
basin
then
upon
entering
his
presence
i
kissed
his
knee
and
he
received
me
very
graciously
i
thanked
his
majesty
for
freeing
me
from
prison
saying
that
all
princes
unique
for
generosity
upon
this
earth
as
was
his
majesty
lay
under
special
obligations
to
set
free
men
of
talent
and
particularly
those
that
were
innocent
as
i
was
such
benefits
i
added
were
inscribed
upon
the
book
of
god
before
any
other
good
actions
the
king
while
i
was
delivering
this
speech
continued
listening
till
the
end
with
the
utmost
courtesy
dropping
a
few
words
such
as
only
he
could
utter
then
he
took
the
vase
and
basin
and
exclaimed
a
truth
i
hardly
think
the
ancients
can
have
seen
a
piece
so
beautiful
as
this
i
well
remember
to
have
inspected
all
the
best
works
and
by
the
greatest
masters
of
all
italy
but
i
never
set
my
eyes
on
anything
which
stirred
me
to
such
these
words
the
king
addressed
in
french
to
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
with
many
others
of
even
warmer
praise
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
in
italian
amuse
yourself
for
a
few
days
make
good
cheer
and
spend
your
time
in
pleasure
in
the
meanwhile
we
will
think
of
giving
you
the
wherewithal
to
execute
some
fine
works
of
art
for
note
the
is
the
cenis
cellini
forgets
that
he
has
not
mentioned
this
apprehension
which
made
him
turn
aside
from
milan
it
may
have
been
the
fear
of
plague
or
perhaps
of
some
enemy
note
it
is
thus
that
cellini
always
writes
fontainebleau
x
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
saw
that
the
king
had
been
vastly
pleased
by
my
arrival
he
also
judged
that
the
trifles
which
i
showed
him
of
my
handicraft
had
encouraged
him
to
hope
for
the
execution
of
some
considerable
things
he
had
in
mind
at
this
time
however
we
were
following
the
court
with
the
weariest
trouble
and
fatigue
the
reason
of
this
was
that
the
train
of
the
king
drags
itself
along
with
never
less
than
horse
behind
it
this
calculation
is
the
very
lowest
for
when
the
court
is
complete
in
times
of
peace
there
are
some
which
makes
less
than
the
average
consequently
we
had
to
journey
after
it
through
places
where
sometimes
there
were
scarcely
two
houses
to
be
found
and
then
we
set
up
canvas
tents
like
gipsies
and
suffered
at
times
very
great
discomfort
i
therefore
kept
urging
the
cardinal
to
put
the
king
in
mind
of
employing
me
in
some
locality
where
i
could
stop
and
work
the
cardinal
answered
that
it
was
far
better
to
wait
until
the
king
should
think
of
it
himself
and
that
i
ought
to
show
myself
at
times
to
his
majesty
while
he
was
at
table
this
i
did
then
and
one
morning
at
his
dinner
the
king
called
me
he
began
to
talk
to
me
in
italian
saying
he
had
it
in
his
mind
to
execute
several
great
works
and
that
he
would
soon
give
orders
where
i
was
to
labour
and
provide
me
with
all
necessaries
these
communications
he
mingled
with
discourse
on
divers
pleasant
matters
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
was
there
because
he
almost
always
ate
in
the
morning
at
the
table
he
had
heard
our
conversation
and
when
the
king
rose
he
spoke
in
my
favour
to
this
purport
as
i
afterwards
was
informed
majesty
this
man
benvenuto
is
very
eager
to
get
to
work
again
it
seems
almost
a
sin
to
let
an
artist
of
his
abilities
waste
his
the
king
replied
that
he
had
spoken
well
and
told
him
to
arrange
with
me
all
things
for
my
support
according
to
my
wishes
upon
the
evening
of
the
day
when
he
received
this
commission
the
cardinal
sent
for
me
after
supper
and
told
me
that
his
majesty
was
resolved
to
let
me
begin
working
but
that
he
wanted
me
first
to
come
to
an
understanding
about
my
appointments
to
this
the
cardinal
added
seems
to
me
that
if
his
majesty
allows
you
three
hundred
crowns
a
year
you
will
be
able
to
keep
yourself
very
well
indeed
furthermore
i
advise
you
to
leave
yourself
in
my
hands
for
every
day
offers
the
opportunity
of
doing
some
service
in
this
great
kingdom
and
i
shall
exert
myself
with
vigour
in
your
then
i
began
to
speak
as
follows
your
most
reverend
lordship
left
me
in
ferrara
you
gave
me
a
promise
which
i
had
never
asked
for
not
to
bring
me
out
of
italy
before
i
clearly
understood
the
terms
on
which
i
should
be
placed
here
with
his
majesty
instead
of
sending
to
communicate
these
details
your
most
reverend
lordship
urgently
ordered
me
to
come
by
the
post
as
if
an
art
like
mine
was
carried
on
had
you
written
to
tell
me
of
three
hundred
crowns
as
you
have
now
spoken
i
would
not
have
stirred
a
foot
for
twice
that
sum
nevertheless
i
thank
god
and
your
most
reverend
lordship
for
all
things
seeing
god
has
employed
you
as
the
instrument
for
my
great
good
in
procuring
my
liberation
from
imprisonment
therefore
i
assure
your
lordship
that
all
the
troubles
you
are
now
causing
me
fall
a
thousand
times
short
of
the
great
good
which
you
have
done
me
with
all
my
heart
i
thank
you
and
take
good
leave
of
you
wherever
i
may
be
so
long
as
i
have
life
i
will
pray
god
for
the
cardinal
was
greatly
irritated
and
cried
out
in
a
rage
where
you
choose
it
is
impossible
to
help
people
against
their
some
of
his
courtiers
who
were
present
said
fellow
sets
great
store
on
himself
for
he
is
refusing
three
hundred
ducats
a
another
who
was
a
man
of
talent
replied
king
will
never
find
his
equal
and
our
cardinal
wants
to
cheapen
him
as
though
he
were
a
load
of
this
was
messer
luigi
alamanni
who
spoke
to
the
above
effect
as
i
was
afterwards
informed
all
this
happened
on
the
last
day
of
october
in
dauphiné
at
a
castle
the
name
of
which
i
do
not
remember
xi
on
leaving
the
cardinal
i
repaired
to
my
lodging
which
was
three
miles
distant
in
company
with
a
secretary
of
the
cardinal
returning
to
the
same
quarters
on
the
road
this
man
never
stopped
asking
me
what
i
meant
to
do
with
myself
and
what
my
own
terms
regarding
the
appointment
would
have
been
i
gave
him
only
one
word
back
for
answer
which
was
that
i
knew
all
when
we
came
to
our
quarters
i
found
pagolo
and
ascanio
there
and
seeing
me
much
troubled
they
implored
me
to
tell
them
what
was
the
matter
to
the
poor
young
men
who
were
all
dismayed
i
said
for
answer
i
shall
give
you
money
amply
sufficient
for
your
journey
home
i
mean
myself
to
go
about
a
most
important
business
without
you
which
for
a
long
time
i
have
had
it
in
my
mind
to
our
room
adjoined
that
of
the
secretary
and
i
think
it
not
improbable
that
he
wrote
to
the
cardinal
and
informed
him
of
my
purpose
however
i
never
knew
anything
for
certain
about
this
the
night
passed
without
sleep
and
i
kept
wearying
for
the
day
in
order
to
carry
out
my
resolution
no
sooner
did
it
dawn
than
i
ordered
out
the
horses
made
my
preparations
in
a
moment
and
gave
the
two
young
men
everything
which
i
had
brought
with
me
and
fifty
ducats
of
gold
in
addition
i
reserved
the
same
sum
for
myself
together
with
the
diamond
the
duke
had
given
me
i
only
kept
two
shirts
and
some
which
i
had
upon
my
back
i
found
it
almost
impossible
to
get
free
of
the
two
young
men
who
insisted
upon
going
with
me
whatever
happened
at
last
i
was
obliged
to
treat
them
with
contempt
and
use
this
language
of
you
has
his
first
beard
and
the
other
is
just
getting
it
and
both
of
you
have
learned
as
much
from
me
as
i
could
teach
in
my
poor
art
so
that
you
are
now
the
first
craftsmen
among
the
youths
of
italy
are
you
not
ashamed
to
have
no
courage
to
quit
this
but
must
always
creep
about
in
the
thing
is
too
disgraceful
or
if
i
were
to
send
you
away
without
money
what
would
you
say
then
come
take
yourselves
out
of
my
sight
and
may
god
bless
you
a
thousand
times
farewell
i
turned
my
horse
and
left
them
weeping
then
i
took
my
way
along
a
very
fair
road
through
a
forest
hoping
to
make
at
least
forty
miles
that
day
and
reach
the
most
place
i
could
i
had
already
ridden
about
two
miles
and
during
that
short
time
had
resolved
never
to
revisit
any
of
those
parts
where
i
was
known
i
also
determined
to
abandon
my
art
so
soon
as
i
had
made
a
christ
three
cubits
in
height
reproducing
so
far
as
i
was
able
that
infinite
beauty
which
he
had
himself
revealed
to
me
so
then
being
thoroughly
resolved
i
turned
my
face
toward
the
holy
sepulchre
just
when
i
thought
i
had
got
so
far
that
nobody
could
find
me
i
heard
horses
galloping
after
they
filled
me
with
some
uneasiness
because
that
district
is
infested
with
a
race
of
brigands
who
bear
the
name
of
venturers
and
are
apt
to
murder
men
upon
the
road
though
numbers
of
them
are
hanged
every
day
it
seems
as
though
they
did
not
care
however
when
the
riders
approached
i
found
they
were
a
messenger
from
the
king
and
my
lad
ascanio
the
former
came
up
to
me
and
said
the
king
i
order
you
to
come
immediately
to
his
i
replied
have
been
sent
by
the
cardinal
and
for
this
reason
i
will
not
the
man
said
that
since
gentle
usage
would
not
bring
me
he
had
authority
to
raise
the
folk
and
they
would
take
me
bound
hand
and
foot
like
a
prisoner
ascanio
for
his
part
did
all
he
could
to
persuade
me
reminding
me
that
when
the
king
sent
a
man
to
prison
he
kept
him
there
five
years
at
least
before
he
let
him
out
again
this
word
about
the
prison
when
i
remembered
what
i
had
endured
in
rome
struck
such
terror
into
me
that
i
wheeled
my
horse
round
briskly
and
followed
the
messenger
he
kept
perpetually
chattering
in
french
through
all
our
journey
up
to
the
very
precincts
of
the
court
at
one
time
bullying
now
saying
one
thing
then
another
till
i
felt
inclined
to
deny
god
and
the
world
note
see
above
for
vow
in
the
castle
of
angelo
xii
on
our
way
to
the
lodgings
of
the
king
we
passed
before
those
of
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
standing
at
his
door
he
called
to
me
and
said
most
christian
monarch
has
of
his
own
accord
assigned
you
the
same
appointments
which
his
majesty
allowed
the
painter
lionardo
da
vinci
that
is
a
salary
of
seven
hundred
crowns
in
addition
he
will
pay
you
for
all
the
works
you
do
for
him
also
for
your
journey
hither
he
gives
you
five
hundred
golden
crowns
which
will
be
paid
you
before
you
quit
this
at
the
end
of
this
announcement
i
replied
that
those
were
offers
worthy
of
the
great
king
he
was
the
messenger
not
knowing
anything
about
me
and
hearing
what
splendid
offers
had
been
made
me
by
the
king
begged
my
pardon
over
and
over
again
pagolo
and
ascanio
exclaimed
is
god
who
has
helped
us
to
get
back
into
so
honoured
a
on
the
day
following
i
went
to
thank
the
king
who
ordered
me
to
make
the
models
of
twelve
silver
statues
which
were
to
stand
as
candelabra
round
his
table
he
wanted
them
to
represent
six
gods
and
six
goddesses
and
to
have
exactly
the
same
height
as
his
majesty
which
was
a
trifle
under
four
cubits
having
dictated
this
commission
he
turned
to
his
treasurer
and
asked
whether
he
had
paid
me
the
five
hundred
crowns
the
official
said
that
he
had
received
no
orders
to
that
effect
the
king
took
this
very
ill
for
he
had
requested
the
cardinal
to
speak
to
him
about
it
furthermore
he
told
me
to
go
to
paris
and
seek
out
a
place
to
live
in
fitted
for
the
execution
of
such
work
he
would
see
that
i
obtained
it
i
got
the
five
hundred
crowns
of
gold
and
took
up
my
quarters
at
paris
in
a
house
of
the
cardinal
of
ferrera
there
i
began
in
name
to
work
and
fashioned
four
little
waxen
models
about
of
a
cubit
each
in
height
they
were
jupiter
juno
apollo
and
vulcan
in
this
while
the
king
returned
to
paris
whereupon
i
went
to
him
at
once
taking
my
models
with
me
and
my
two
prentices
ascanio
and
pagolo
on
perceiving
that
the
king
was
pleased
with
my
work
and
being
commissioned
to
execute
the
jupiter
in
silver
of
the
height
above
described
i
introduced
the
two
young
men
and
said
that
i
had
brought
them
with
me
out
of
italy
to
serve
his
majesty
for
inasmuch
as
they
had
been
brought
up
by
me
i
could
at
the
beginning
get
more
help
from
them
than
from
the
paris
workmen
to
this
the
king
replied
that
i
might
name
a
salary
which
i
thought
sufficient
for
their
maintenance
i
said
that
a
hundred
crowns
of
gold
apiece
would
be
quite
proper
and
that
i
would
make
them
earn
their
wages
well
this
agreement
was
concluded
then
i
said
that
i
had
found
a
place
which
seemed
to
me
exactly
suited
to
my
industry
it
was
his
own
property
and
called
the
little
nello
the
provost
of
paris
was
then
in
possession
of
it
from
his
majesty
but
since
the
provost
made
no
use
of
the
castle
his
majesty
perhaps
might
grant
it
me
to
employ
in
his
service
he
replied
upon
the
instant
place
is
my
own
house
and
i
know
well
that
the
man
i
gave
it
to
does
not
inhabit
or
use
it
so
you
shall
have
it
for
the
work
you
have
to
he
then
told
his
lieutenant
to
install
me
in
the
nello
this
officer
made
some
resistance
pleading
that
he
could
not
carry
out
the
order
the
king
answered
in
anger
that
he
meant
to
bestow
his
property
on
whom
he
pleased
and
on
a
man
who
would
serve
him
seeing
that
he
got
nothing
from
the
other
therefore
he
would
hear
no
more
about
it
the
lieutenant
then
submitted
that
some
small
force
would
have
to
be
employed
in
order
to
effect
an
entrance
to
which
the
king
answered
then
and
if
a
small
force
is
not
enough
use
a
great
the
officer
took
me
immediately
to
the
castle
and
there
put
me
in
possession
not
however
without
violence
after
that
he
warned
me
to
take
very
good
care
that
i
was
not
murdered
i
installed
myself
enrolled
and
bought
a
quantity
of
pikes
and
partisans
but
i
remained
for
several
days
exposed
to
grievous
annoyances
for
the
provost
was
a
great
nobleman
of
paris
and
all
the
other
gentlefolk
took
part
against
me
they
attacked
me
with
such
insults
that
i
could
hardly
hold
my
own
against
them
i
must
not
omit
to
mention
that
i
entered
the
service
of
his
majesty
in
the
year
which
was
exactly
the
year
in
which
i
reached
the
age
of
forty
note
this
was
the
castle
of
le
petit
nesle
on
the
site
of
which
now
stands
the
palace
of
the
institute
the
provost
of
paris
was
then
jean
lord
of
villebon
xiii
the
affronts
and
insults
i
received
made
me
have
recourse
to
the
king
begging
his
majesty
to
establish
me
in
some
other
place
he
answered
are
you
and
what
is
your
name
i
remained
in
great
confusion
and
could
not
comprehend
what
he
meant
holding
my
tongue
thus
the
king
repeated
the
same
words
a
second
time
angrily
then
i
said
my
name
was
benvenuto
then
you
are
the
benvenuto
of
whom
i
have
heard
replied
the
king
according
to
your
wont
for
you
have
my
full
leave
to
do
i
told
his
majesty
that
all
i
wanted
was
to
keep
his
favour
for
the
rest
i
knew
of
nothing
that
could
harm
me
he
gave
a
little
laugh
and
said
your
ways
then
you
shall
never
want
my
upon
this
he
told
his
first
secretary
monsignor
di
villerois
to
see
me
provided
and
accommodated
with
all
i
needed
this
villerois
was
an
intimate
friend
of
the
provost
to
whom
the
castle
had
been
given
it
was
built
in
a
triangle
right
up
against
the
city
walls
and
was
of
some
antiquity
but
had
no
garrison
the
building
was
of
considerable
size
monsignor
di
villerois
counselled
me
to
look
about
for
something
else
and
by
all
means
to
leave
this
place
alone
seeing
that
its
owner
was
a
man
of
vast
power
who
would
most
assuredly
have
me
killed
i
answered
that
i
had
come
from
italy
to
france
only
in
order
to
serve
that
illustrious
king
and
as
for
dying
i
knew
for
certain
that
die
i
must
a
little
earlier
or
a
little
later
was
a
matter
of
supreme
indifference
to
me
now
villerois
was
a
man
of
the
highest
talent
exceptionally
distinguished
in
all
points
and
possessed
of
vast
wealth
there
was
nothing
he
would
not
gladly
have
done
to
harm
me
but
he
made
no
open
demonstration
of
his
mind
he
was
grave
and
of
a
noble
presence
and
spoke
slowly
at
his
ease
to
another
gentleman
monsignor
di
marmagna
the
treasurer
of
languedoc
he
left
the
duty
of
molesting
me
the
first
thing
which
this
man
did
was
to
look
out
the
best
apartments
in
the
castle
and
to
have
them
fitted
up
for
himself
i
told
him
that
the
king
had
given
me
the
place
to
serve
him
in
and
that
i
did
not
choose
it
should
be
occupied
by
any
but
myself
and
my
attendants
the
fellow
who
was
haughty
bold
and
spirited
replied
that
he
meant
to
do
just
what
he
liked
that
i
should
run
my
head
against
a
wall
if
i
presumed
to
oppose
him
and
that
villerois
had
given
him
authority
to
do
what
he
was
doing
i
told
him
that
by
the
authority
given
to
me
neither
he
nor
villerois
could
do
it
when
i
said
that
he
gave
vent
to
offensive
language
in
french
whereat
i
retorted
in
my
own
tongue
that
he
lied
stung
with
rage
he
clapped
his
hand
upon
a
little
dagger
which
he
had
then
i
set
my
hand
also
to
a
large
dirk
which
i
always
wore
for
my
defence
and
cried
out
you
dare
to
draw
kill
you
on
the
he
had
two
servants
to
back
him
and
i
had
my
two
lads
for
a
moment
or
two
marmagna
stood
in
doubt
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
do
but
rather
inclined
to
mischief
and
muttering
will
never
put
up
with
such
seeing
then
that
the
affair
was
taking
a
bad
turn
i
took
a
sudden
resolution
and
cried
to
pagolo
and
ascanio
you
see
me
draw
my
dirk
throw
yourselves
upon
those
and
kill
them
if
you
can
i
mean
to
kill
this
fellow
at
the
first
stroke
and
then
we
will
decamp
together
with
marmagna
when
he
understood
my
purpose
was
glad
enough
to
get
alive
out
of
the
castle
all
these
things
toning
them
down
a
trifle
i
wrote
to
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
who
related
them
at
once
to
the
king
the
king
deeply
irritated
committed
me
to
the
care
of
another
officer
of
his
bodyguard
who
was
named
monsignor
lo
iscontro
by
him
i
was
accommodated
with
all
that
i
required
in
the
most
gracious
way
imaginable

it
seems
that
by
cellini
meant
viscount
xiv
after
fitting
up
my
own
lodgings
in
the
castle
and
the
workshop
with
all
conveniences
for
carrying
on
my
business
and
putting
my
household
upon
a
most
respectable
footing
i
began
at
once
to
construct
three
models
exactly
of
the
size
which
the
silver
statues
were
to
be
these
were
jupiter
vulcan
and
mars
i
moulded
them
in
clay
and
set
them
well
up
on
irons
then
i
went
to
the
king
who
disbursed
three
hundred
pounds
weight
of
silver
if
i
remember
rightly
for
the
commencement
of
the
undertaking
while
i
was
getting
these
things
ready
we
brought
the
little
vase
and
oval
basin
to
completion
which
had
been
several
months
in
hand
then
i
had
them
richly
gilt
and
they
showed
like
the
finest
piece
of
plate
which
had
been
seen
in
france
afterwards
i
took
them
to
the
cardinal
who
thanked
me
greatly
and
without
requesting
my
attendance
carried
and
presented
them
to
the
king
he
was
delighted
with
the
gift
and
praised
me
as
no
artist
was
ever
praised
before
in
return
he
bestowed
upon
the
cardinal
an
abbey
worth
seven
thousand
crowns
a
year
and
expressed
his
intention
of
rewarding
me
too
the
cardinal
however
prevented
him
telling
his
majesty
that
he
was
going
ahead
too
fast
since
i
had
as
yet
produced
nothing
for
him
the
king
who
was
exceedingly
generous
replied
that
very
reason
will
i
put
heart
and
hope
into
the
cardinal
ashamed
at
his
own
meanness
said
i
beg
you
to
leave
that
to
me
i
will
allow
him
a
pension
of
at
least
three
hundred
crowns
when
have
taken
possession
of
the
he
never
gave
me
anything
and
it
would
be
tedious
to
relate
all
the
knavish
tricks
of
this
prelate
i
prefer
to
dwell
on
matters
of
greater
moment
xv
when
i
returned
to
paris
the
great
favour
shown
me
by
the
king
made
me
a
mark
for
all
admiration
i
received
the
silver
and
began
my
statue
of
jupiter
many
journeymen
were
now
in
my
employ
and
the
work
went
onward
briskly
day
and
night
so
that
by
the
time
i
had
finished
the
clay
models
of
jupiter
vulcan
and
mars
and
had
begun
to
get
the
silver
statue
forward
my
workshop
made
already
a
grand
show
the
king
now
came
to
paris
and
i
went
to
pay
him
my
respects
no
sooner
had
his
majesty
set
eyes
upon
me
than
he
called
me
cheerfully
and
asked
if
i
had
something
fine
to
exhibit
at
my
lodging
for
he
would
come
to
inspect
it
i
related
all
i
had
been
doing
upon
which
he
was
seized
with
a
strong
desire
to
come
accordingly
after
this
dinner
he
set
off
with
madame
de
tampes
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
and
some
other
of
his
greatest
nobles
among
whom
were
the
king
of
navarre
his
cousin
and
the
queen
his
sister
the
dauphin
and
dauphinéss
also
attended
him
so
that
upon
that
day
the
very
flower
of
the
french
court
came
to
visit
me
i
had
been
some
time
at
home
and
was
hard
at
work
when
the
king
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
castle
and
heard
our
hammers
going
he
bade
his
company
keep
silence
everybody
in
my
house
was
busily
employed
so
that
the
unexpected
entrance
of
his
majesty
took
me
by
surprise
the
first
thing
he
saw
on
coming
into
the
great
hall
was
myself
with
a
huge
plate
of
silver
in
my
hand
which
i
was
beating
for
the
body
of
my
jupiter
one
of
my
men
was
finishing
the
head
another
the
legs
and
it
is
easy
to
imagine
what
a
din
we
made
between
us
it
happened
that
a
little
french
lad
was
working
at
my
side
who
had
just
been
guilty
of
some
trifling
blunder
i
gave
the
lad
a
kick
and
as
my
good
luck
would
have
it
caught
him
with
my
foot
exactly
in
the
fork
between
his
legs
and
sent
him
spinning
several
yards
so
that
he
came
stumbling
up
against
the
king
precisely
at
the
moment
when
his
majesty
arrived
the
king
was
vastly
amused
but
i
felt
covered
with
confusion
he
began
to
ask
me
what
i
was
engaged
upon
and
told
me
to
go
on
working
then
he
said
that
he
would
much
rather
have
me
not
employ
my
strength
on
manual
labour
but
take
as
many
men
as
i
wanted
and
make
them
do
the
rough
work
he
should
like
me
to
keep
myself
in
health
in
order
that
he
might
enjoy
my
services
through
many
years
to
come
i
replied
to
his
majesty
that
the
moment
i
left
off
working
i
should
fall
ill
also
that
my
art
itself
would
suffer
and
not
attain
the
mark
i
aimed
at
for
his
majesty
thinking
that
i
spoke
thus
only
to
brag
and
not
because
it
was
the
truth
he
made
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
repeat
what
he
had
said
but
i
explained
my
reasons
so
fully
and
clearly
that
the
cardinal
perceived
my
drift
he
then
advised
the
king
to
let
me
labour
as
much
or
little
as
i
liked
note
these
personages
were
madame
the
mistress
john
of
lorraine
son
of
duke
renée
who
was
made
cardinal
in
henri
ii
and
marguerite
de
valois
his
wife
the
duaphin
afterwards
henri
and
his
wife
the
celebrated
caterina
medici
daughter
of
lorenzo
duke
of
urbino
xvi
being
very
well
satisfied
with
what
he
had
seen
the
king
returned
to
his
palace
after
bestowing
on
me
too
many
marks
of
favour
to
be
here
recorded
on
the
following
day
he
sent
for
me
at
his
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
was
there
at
meat
with
him
when
i
arrived
the
king
had
reached
his
second
course
he
began
at
once
to
speak
to
me
saying
with
a
pleasant
cheer
that
having
now
so
fine
a
basin
and
jug
of
my
workmanship
he
wanted
an
equally
handsome
to
match
them
and
begged
me
to
make
a
design
and
to
lose
no
time
about
it
i
replied
majesty
shall
see
a
model
of
the
sort
even
sooner
than
you
have
commanded
for
while
i
was
making
the
basin
i
thought
there
ought
to
be
a
saltcellar
to
match
it
therefore
i
have
already
designed
one
and
if
it
is
your
pleasure
i
will
at
once
exhibit
my
the
king
turned
with
a
lively
movement
of
surprise
and
pleasure
to
the
lords
in
his
company
they
were
the
king
of
navarre
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
and
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
exclaiming
as
he
did
so
my
word
this
is
a
man
to
be
loved
and
cherished
by
every
one
who
knows
then
he
told
me
that
he
would
very
gladly
see
my
model
i
set
off
and
returned
in
a
few
minutes
for
i
had
only
to
cross
the
river
that
is
the
seine
i
carried
with
me
the
wax
model
which
i
had
made
in
rome
at
the
cardinal
of
request
when
i
appeared
again
before
the
king
and
uncovered
my
piece
he
cried
out
in
astonishment
is
a
hundred
times
more
divine
a
thing
that
i
had
ever
dreamed
of
what
a
miracle
of
a
man
he
ought
never
to
stop
then
he
turned
to
me
with
a
beaming
countenance
and
told
me
that
he
greatly
liked
the
piece
and
wished
me
to
execute
it
in
gold
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
looked
me
in
the
face
and
let
me
understand
that
he
recognised
the
model
as
the
same
which
i
had
made
for
him
in
rome
i
replied
that
i
had
already
told
him
i
should
carry
it
out
for
one
who
was
worthy
of
it
the
cardinal
remembering
my
words
and
nettled
by
the
revenge
he
thought
that
i
was
taking
on
him
remarked
to
the
king
this
is
an
enormous
undertaking
i
am
only
afraid
that
we
shall
never
see
it
finished
these
able
artists
who
have
great
conceptions
in
their
brain
are
ready
enough
to
put
the
same
in
execution
without
duly
considering
when
they
are
to
be
accomplished
i
therefore
if
i
gave
commission
for
things
of
such
magnitude
should
like
to
know
when
i
was
likely
to
get
the
king
replied
that
if
a
man
was
so
scrupulous
about
the
termination
of
a
work
he
would
never
begin
anything
at
all
these
words
he
uttered
with
a
certain
look
which
implied
that
such
enterprises
were
not
for
folk
of
little
spirit
i
then
began
to
say
my
say
who
put
heart
and
courage
in
their
servants
as
your
majesty
does
by
deed
and
word
render
undertakings
of
the
greatest
magnitude
quite
easy
now
that
god
has
sent
me
so
magnificent
a
patron
i
hope
to
perform
for
him
a
multitude
of
great
and
splendid
believe
it
said
the
king
and
rose
from
table
then
he
called
me
into
his
chamber
and
asked
me
how
much
gold
was
wanted
for
the
thousand
crowns
i
answered
he
called
his
treasurer
at
once
who
was
the
viscount
of
orbec
and
ordered
him
that
very
day
to
disburse
to
me
a
thousand
crowns
of
good
weight
and
old
gold
when
i
left
his
majesty
i
went
for
the
two
notaries
who
had
helped
me
in
procuring
silver
for
the
jupiter
and
many
other
things
crossing
the
seine
i
then
took
a
small
which
one
of
my
cousins
a
nun
had
given
me
on
my
journey
through
florence
it
made
for
my
good
fortune
that
i
took
this
basket
and
not
a
bag
so
then
thinking
i
could
do
the
business
by
daylight
for
it
was
still
early
and
not
caring
to
interrupt
my
workmen
and
being
indisposed
to
take
a
servant
with
me
i
set
off
alone
when
i
reached
the
house
of
the
treasurer
i
found
that
he
had
the
money
laid
out
before
him
and
was
selecting
the
best
pieces
as
the
king
had
ordered
it
seemed
to
me
however
that
that
thief
of
a
treasurer
was
doing
all
he
could
to
postpone
the
payment
of
the
money
nor
were
the
pieces
counted
out
until
three
hours
after
nightfall
i
meanwhile
was
not
wanting
in
despatch
for
i
sent
word
to
several
of
my
journeymen
that
they
should
come
and
attend
me
since
the
matter
was
one
of
serious
importance
when
i
found
that
they
did
not
arrive
i
asked
the
messenger
if
he
had
done
my
errand
the
rascal
of
a
groom
whom
i
had
sent
replied
that
he
had
done
so
but
that
they
had
answered
that
they
could
not
come
he
however
would
gladly
carry
the
money
for
me
i
answered
that
i
meant
to
carry
the
money
myself
but
this
time
the
contract
was
drawn
up
and
signed
on
the
money
being
counted
i
put
it
all
into
my
little
basket
and
then
thrust
my
arm
through
the
two
handles
since
i
did
this
with
some
difficulty
the
gold
was
well
shut
in
and
i
carried
it
more
conveniently
than
if
the
vehicle
had
been
a
bag
i
was
well
armed
with
shirt
and
sleeves
of
mail
and
having
my
sword
and
dagger
at
my
side
made
off
along
the
street
as
quick
as
my
two
legs
would
carry
me
xvii
just
as
i
left
the
house
i
observed
some
servants
whispering
among
themselves
who
also
went
off
at
a
round
pace
in
another
direction
from
the
one
i
took
walking
with
all
haste
i
passed
the
bridge
of
the
exchange
and
went
up
along
a
wall
beside
the
river
which
led
to
my
lodging
in
the
castle
i
had
just
come
to
the
augustines
now
this
was
a
very
perilous
passage
and
though
it
was
only
five
hundred
paces
distant
from
my
dwelling
yet
the
lodging
in
the
castle
being
quite
as
far
removed
inside
no
one
could
have
heard
my
voice
if
i
had
shouted
when
i
saw
four
men
with
four
swords
in
their
hands
advancing
to
attack
me
my
resolution
was
taken
in
an
instant
i
covered
the
basket
with
my
cape
drew
my
sword
and
seeing
that
they
were
pushing
hotly
forward
cried
aloud
soldiers
there
is
only
the
cape
and
sword
to
gain
and
these
before
i
give
them
up
i
hope
get
not
much
to
your
then
crossing
my
sword
boldly
with
them
i
more
than
once
spread
out
my
arms
in
order
that
if
the
ruffians
were
put
on
by
the
servants
who
had
seen
me
take
my
money
they
might
be
led
to
judge
i
was
not
carrying
it
the
encounter
was
soon
over
for
they
retired
step
by
step
saying
among
themselves
in
their
own
language
is
a
brave
italian
and
certainly
not
the
man
we
are
after
or
if
he
be
the
man
he
can
not
be
carrying
i
spoke
italian
and
kept
harrying
them
with
thrust
and
slash
so
hotly
that
i
narrowly
missed
killing
one
or
the
other
my
skill
in
using
the
sword
made
them
think
i
was
a
soldier
rather
than
a
fellow
of
some
other
calling
they
drew
together
and
began
to
fall
back
muttering
all
the
while
beneath
their
breath
in
their
own
tongue
i
meanwhile
continued
always
calling
out
but
not
too
loudly
that
those
who
wanted
my
cape
and
blade
would
have
to
get
them
with
some
trouble
then
i
quickened
pace
while
they
still
followed
slowly
at
my
heels
this
augmented
my
fear
for
i
thought
i
might
be
falling
into
an
ambuscade
which
would
have
cut
me
off
in
front
as
well
as
rear
accordingly
when
i
was
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
paces
from
my
home
i
ran
with
all
my
might
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
arms
to
arms
out
with
you
out
with
you
i
am
being
in
a
moment
four
of
my
young
men
came
running
with
four
pikes
in
their
hands
they
wanted
to
pursue
the
ruffians
who
could
still
be
seen
but
i
stopped
them
calling
back
so
as
to
let
the
villains
hear
cowards
yonder
four
against
one
man
alone
had
not
pluck
enough
to
capture
a
thousand
golden
crowns
in
metal
which
have
almost
broken
this
arm
of
mine
let
us
haste
inside
and
put
the
money
away
then
i
will
take
my
big
sword
and
go
with
you
whithersoever
you
we
went
inside
to
secure
the
gold
and
my
lads
while
expressing
deep
concern
for
the
peril
i
had
run
gently
chided
me
and
said
risk
yourself
too
much
alone
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
make
us
all
bemoan
your
a
thousand
words
and
exclamations
were
exchanged
between
us
my
adversaries
took
to
flight
and
we
all
sat
down
and
supped
together
with
mirth
and
gladness
laughing
over
those
great
blows
which
fortune
strikes
for
good
as
well
as
evil
and
which
what
time
they
do
not
hit
the
mark
are
just
the
same
as
though
they
had
not
happened
it
is
very
true
that
one
says
to
oneself
will
have
had
a
lesson
for
next
but
that
is
not
the
case
for
fortune
always
comes
upon
us
in
new
ways
quite
unforeseen
by
our
imagination
note
the
pont
du
change
replaced
by
the
pont
neuf
note
the
excitement
of
his
recollection
makes
cellini
more
than
usually
incoherent
about
this
episode
the
translator
has
to
collect
the
whole
sense
of
the
passage
note
philosophy
is
summed
up
in
the
proverb
miss
is
as
good
as
a
xviii
on
the
morning
which
followed
these
events
i
made
the
first
step
in
my
work
upon
the
great
pressing
this
and
my
other
pieces
forward
with
incessant
industry
my
workpeople
at
this
time
who
were
pretty
numerous
included
both
sculptors
and
goldsmiths
they
belonged
to
several
nations
italian
french
and
german
for
i
took
the
best
i
could
find
and
changed
them
often
retaining
only
those
who
knew
their
business
well
these
select
craftsmen
i
worked
to
the
bone
with
perpetual
labour
they
wanted
to
rival
me
but
i
had
a
better
constitution
consequently
in
their
inability
to
bear
up
against
such
a
continuous
strain
they
took
to
eating
and
drinking
copiously
some
of
the
germans
in
particular
who
were
more
skilled
than
their
comrades
and
wanted
to
march
apace
with
me
sank
under
these
excesses
and
perished
while
i
was
at
work
upon
the
jupiter
i
noticed
that
i
had
plenty
of
silver
to
spare
so
i
took
in
hand
without
consulting
the
king
to
make
a
great
vase
about
one
cubit
and
a
half
in
height
i
also
conceived
the
notion
of
casting
the
large
model
of
my
jupiter
in
bronze
having
up
to
this
date
done
nothing
of
the
sort
i
conferred
with
certain
old
men
experienced
in
that
art
at
paris
and
described
to
them
the
methods
in
use
with
us
in
italy
they
told
me
they
had
never
gone
that
way
about
the
business
but
that
if
i
gave
them
leave
to
act
upon
their
own
principles
they
would
bring
the
bronze
out
as
clean
and
perfect
as
the
clay
i
chose
to
strike
an
agreement
throwing
on
them
the
responsibility
and
promising
several
crowns
above
the
price
they
bargained
for
thereupon
they
put
the
work
in
progress
but
i
soon
saw
that
they
were
going
the
wrong
way
about
it
and
began
on
my
own
account
a
head
of
julius
cćsar
bust
and
armour
much
larger
than
the
life
which
i
modelled
from
a
reduced
copy
of
a
splendid
antique
portrait
i
had
brought
with
me
from
rome
i
also
undertook
another
head
of
the
same
size
studied
from
a
very
handsome
girl
whom
i
kept
for
my
own
pleasures
i
called
this
fontainebleau
after
the
place
selected
by
the
king
for
his
particular
delight
we
constructed
an
admirable
little
furnace
for
the
casting
of
the
bronze
got
all
things
ready
and
baked
our
moulds
those
french
masters
undertaking
the
jupiter
while
i
looked
after
my
two
heads
then
i
said
do
not
think
you
will
succeed
with
your
jupiter
because
you
have
not
provided
sufficient
vents
beneath
for
the
air
to
circulate
therefore
you
are
but
losing
your
time
and
they
replied
that
if
their
work
proved
a
failure
they
would
pay
back
the
money
i
had
given
on
account
and
recoup
me
for
current
expenses
but
they
bade
me
give
good
heed
to
my
own
proceedings
for
the
fine
heads
i
meant
to
cast
in
my
italian
fashion
would
never
succeed
at
this
dispute
between
us
there
were
present
the
treasurers
and
other
gentlefolk
commissioned
by
the
king
to
superintend
my
proceedings
everything
which
passed
by
word
or
act
was
duly
reported
to
his
majesty
the
two
old
men
who
had
undertaken
to
cast
my
jupiter
postponed
the
experiment
saying
they
would
like
to
arrange
the
moulds
of
my
two
heads
they
argued
that
according
to
my
method
no
success
could
be
expected
and
it
was
a
pity
to
waste
such
fine
models
when
the
king
was
informed
of
this
he
sent
word
that
they
should
give
their
minds
to
learning
and
not
try
to
teach
their
master
so
then
they
put
their
now
piece
into
the
furnace
with
much
laughter
while
i
maintaining
a
firm
carriage
showing
neither
mirth
nor
anger
though
i
felt
it
placed
my
two
heads
one
on
each
side
of
the
jupiter
the
metal
came
all
right
to
melting
and
we
let
it
in
with
joy
and
gladness
it
filled
the
mould
of
the
jupiter
most
admirably
and
at
the
same
time
my
two
heads
this
furnished
them
with
matter
for
rejoicing
and
me
with
satisfaction
for
i
was
not
sorry
to
have
predicted
wrongly
of
their
work
and
they
made
as
though
they
were
delighted
to
have
been
mistaken
about
mine
then
as
the
custom
in
france
is
they
asked
to
drink
in
high
good
spirits
i
was
very
willing
and
ordered
a
handsome
collation
for
their
entertainment
when
this
was
over
they
requested
me
to
pay
the
money
due
to
them
and
the
surplus
i
had
promised
i
replied
have
been
laughing
over
what
i
fear
may
make
you
weep
on
reflection
it
seems
to
me
that
too
much
metal
flowed
into
you
mould
therefore
i
shall
wait
until
before
i
disburse
more
the
poor
fellows
swallowed
my
words
and
chewed
the
cud
of
them
then
they
went
home
without
further
argument
at
daybreak
they
began
quite
quietly
to
break
into
the
pit
of
the
furnace
they
could
not
uncover
their
large
mould
until
they
had
extracted
my
two
heads
these
were
in
excellent
condition
and
they
placed
them
where
they
could
be
well
seen
when
they
came
to
jupiter
and
had
dug
but
scarcely
two
cubits
they
sent
up
such
a
yell
they
and
their
four
workmen
that
it
woke
me
up
fancying
it
was
a
shout
of
triumph
i
set
off
running
for
my
bedroom
was
at
the
distance
of
more
than
five
hundred
paces
on
reaching
the
spot
i
found
them
looking
like
the
guardians
of
sepulchre
in
a
picture
downcast
and
terrified
casting
a
hasty
glance
upon
my
two
heads
and
seeing
they
were
all
right
i
tempered
my
annoyance
with
the
pleasure
that
sight
gave
me
then
they
began
to
make
excuses
crying
bad
luck
i
retorted
luck
has
been
most
excellent
but
what
has
been
indeed
bad
is
your
deficiency
of
knowledge
had
i
only
seen
you
put
the
soul
into
your
mould
i
could
have
taught
you
with
one
word
how
to
cast
the
figure
without
fault
this
would
have
brought
me
great
honour
and
you
much
profit
i
shall
be
able
to
make
good
my
reputation
but
you
will
now
lose
both
your
honour
and
your
profit
let
then
this
lesson
teach
you
another
time
to
work
and
not
to
poke
fun
at
your
note
che
io
guardassi
bene
che
this
is
perhaps
they
bade
me
note
well
that
note
i
have
here
translated
the
italian
literally
by
the
english
word
soul
it
is
a
technical
expression
signifying
the
block
somewhat
smaller
than
the
mould
which
insert
in
order
to
obtain
a
hollow
and
not
a
solid
cast
from
the
mould
which
gives
form
to
their
liquid
metal
xix
about
this
time
the
illustrious
soldier
piero
strozzi
arrived
in
france
and
reminded
the
king
that
he
had
promised
him
letters
of
naturalisation
these
were
accordingly
made
out
and
at
the
same
time
the
king
said
them
be
also
given
to
benvenuto
mon
ami
and
take
them
immediately
to
his
house
and
let
him
have
them
without
the
payment
of
any
those
of
the
great
strozzi
cost
him
several
hundred
ducats
mine
were
brought
me
by
one
of
the
chief
secretaries
messer
antonio
massone
this
gentleman
presented
them
with
many
expressions
of
kindness
from
his
majesty
saying
king
makes
you
a
gift
of
these
in
order
that
you
may
be
encouraged
to
serve
him
they
are
letters
of
then
he
told
me
how
they
had
been
given
to
piero
strozzi
at
his
particular
request
and
only
after
a
long
time
of
waiting
as
a
special
mark
of
favour
the
king
had
sent
mine
of
his
own
accord
and
such
an
act
of
grace
had
never
been
heard
of
in
that
realm
before
when
i
heard
these
words
i
thanked
his
majesty
with
heartiness
but
i
begged
the
secretary
to
have
the
kindness
to
tell
me
what
letters
of
naturalisation
meant
he
was
a
man
accomplished
and
polite
who
spoke
italian
excellently
at
first
my
question
made
him
laugh
then
he
recovered
his
gravity
and
told
me
in
my
own
language
what
the
papers
signified
adding
that
they
conferred
one
of
the
highest
dignities
a
foreigner
could
obtain
it
is
a
far
greater
honour
than
to
be
made
a
nobleman
of
when
he
left
me
he
returned
and
told
his
majesty
who
laughed
awhile
and
then
said
i
wish
him
to
know
my
object
in
sending
those
letters
of
naturalisation
go
and
install
him
lord
of
the
castle
of
the
little
nello
where
he
lives
and
which
is
a
part
of
my
demesne
he
will
know
what
that
means
better
than
he
understood
about
the
letters
of
a
messenger
brought
me
the
patent
upon
which
i
wanted
to
give
him
a
gratuity
he
refused
to
accept
it
saying
that
his
majesty
had
so
ordered
these
letters
of
naturalisation
together
with
the
patent
for
the
castle
i
brought
with
me
when
i
returned
to
italy
wherever
i
go
and
wherever
i
may
end
my
days
i
shall
endeavour
to
preserve
them
note
piero
was
the
son
of
filippo
strozzi
and
the
general
who
lost
the
battle
of
montemurlo
so
disastrous
to
the
florentine

xx
i
shall
now
proceed
with
the
narration
of
my
life
i
had
on
hand
the
following
works
already
mentioned
namely
the
silver
jupiter
the
golden
the
great
silver
vase
and
the
two
bronze
heads
i
also
began
to
cast
the
pedestal
for
jupiter
which
i
wrought
very
richly
in
bronze
covered
with
ornaments
among
which
was
a
representing
the
rape
of
ganymede
and
on
the
other
side
leda
and
the
swan
on
casting
this
piece
it
came
out
admirably
i
also
made
another
pedestal
of
the
same
sort
for
the
statute
of
juno
intending
to
begin
that
too
if
the
king
gave
me
silver
for
the
purpose
by
working
briskly
i
had
put
together
the
silver
jupiter
and
the
golden
the
vase
was
far
advanced
the
two
bronze
heads
were
finished
i
had
also
made
several
little
things
for
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
and
a
small
silver
vase
of
rich
workmanship
which
i
meant
to
present
to
madame
several
italian
noblemen
to
wit
signor
piero
strozzi
the
count
of
anguillara
the
count
of
pitigliano
the
count
of
mirandola
and
many
others
gave
me
employment
also
for
my
great
king
as
i
have
said
i
had
been
working
strenuously
and
the
third
day
after
he
returned
to
paris
he
came
to
my
house
attended
by
a
crowd
of
his
chief
nobles
he
marvelled
to
find
how
many
pieces
i
had
advanced
and
with
what
excellent
results
his
mistress
madame
being
with
him
they
began
to
talk
of
fontainebleau
she
told
his
majesty
he
ought
to
commission
me
to
execute
something
beautiful
for
the
decoration
of
his
favourite
residence
he
answered
on
the
instant
say
well
and
here
upon
the
spot
i
will
make
up
my
mind
what
i
mean
him
to
then
he
turned
to
me
and
asked
me
what
i
thought
would
be
appropriate
for
that
beautiful
fountain
i
suggested
several
ideas
and
his
majesty
expressed
his
own
opinion
afterwards
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
spend
fifteen
or
twenty
days
at
san
germano
del
aia
a
place
twelve
leagues
distant
from
paris
during
his
absence
he
wished
me
to
make
a
model
for
that
fair
fountain
of
his
in
the
richest
style
i
could
invent
seeing
he
delighted
in
that
residence
more
than
in
anything
else
in
his
whole
realm
accordingly
he
commanded
and
besought
me
to
do
my
utmost
to
produce
something
really
beautiful
and
i
promised
that
i
would
do
so
when
the
king
saw
so
many
finished
things
before
him
he
exclaimed
to
madame
never
had
an
artist
who
pleased
me
more
nor
one
who
deserved
better
to
be
well
rewarded
we
must
contrive
to
keep
him
with
us
he
spends
freely
is
a
boon
companion
and
works
hard
we
must
therefore
take
good
thought
for
him
only
think
madam
all
the
times
that
he
has
come
to
me
or
that
i
have
come
to
him
he
has
never
once
asked
for
anything
one
can
see
that
his
heart
is
entirely
devoted
to
his
work
we
ought
to
make
a
point
of
doing
something
for
him
quickly
else
we
run
a
risk
of
losing
madame
answered
will
be
sure
to
remind
then
they
departed
and
in
addition
to
the
things
i
had
begun
i
now
took
the
model
of
the
fountain
in
hand
at
which
i
worked
assiduously
note
anguillara
and
pitigliano
were
fiefs
of
two
separate
branches
of
the
orsini
family
the
house
of
pico
lost
their
lordship
of
mirandola
in
when
galeotto
pico
took
refuge
with
his
sons
in
france
his
descendants
renewed
their
hold
upon
the
fief
which
was
erected
into
a
duchy
in
note
quella
bella
fonte
here
and
below
cellini
mixes
up
fontainebleau
and
the
spring
which
gave
its
name
to
the
place
note
is
not
so
far
from
paris
as
cellini
thought
xxi
at
the
end
of
a
month
and
a
half
the
king
returned
to
paris
and
i
who
had
been
working
day
and
night
went
to
present
myself
before
him
taking
my
model
so
well
blocked
out
that
my
intention
could
be
clearly
understood
just
about
that
time
the
devilries
of
war
between
the
emperor
and
king
had
been
stirred
up
again
so
that
i
found
him
much
harassed
by
anxieties
i
spoke
however
with
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
saying
i
had
brought
some
models
which
his
majesty
had
ordered
and
begging
him
if
he
found
an
opportunity
to
put
in
a
word
whereby
i
might
be
able
to
exhibit
them
the
king
i
thought
would
take
much
pleasure
in
their
sight
this
the
cardinal
did
and
no
sooner
had
he
spoken
of
the
models
than
the
king
came
to
the
place
where
i
had
set
them
up
the
first
of
these
was
intended
for
the
door
of
the
palace
at
fontainebleau
i
had
been
obliged
to
make
some
alterations
in
the
architecture
of
this
door
which
was
wide
and
low
in
their
vicious
french
style
the
opening
was
very
nearly
square
and
above
it
was
a
hemicycle
flattened
like
the
handle
of
a
basket
here
the
king
wanted
a
figure
placed
to
represent
the
genius
of
fontainebleau
i
corrected
the
proportions
of
the
doorway
and
placed
above
it
an
exact
half
circle
at
the
sides
i
introduced
projections
with
socles
and
cornices
properly
corresponding
then
instead
of
the
columns
demanded
by
this
disposition
of
parts
i
fashioned
two
satyrs
one
upon
each
side
the
first
of
these
was
in
somewhat
more
than
lifting
one
hand
to
support
the
cornice
and
holding
a
thick
club
in
the
other
his
face
was
fiery
and
menacing
instilling
fear
into
the
beholders
the
other
had
the
same
posture
of
support
but
i
varied
his
features
and
some
other
details
in
his
hand
for
instance
he
held
a
lash
with
three
balls
attached
to
chains
though
i
call
them
satyrs
they
showed
nothing
of
the
satyr
except
little
horns
and
a
goatish
head
all
the
rest
of
their
form
was
human
in
the
lunette
above
i
placed
a
female
figure
lying
in
an
attitude
of
noble
grace
she
rested
her
left
arm
on
a
neck
this
animal
being
one
of
the
emblems
on
one
side
i
worked
little
fawns
in
half
relief
with
some
wild
boars
and
other
game
in
lower
relief
on
the
other
side
were
hounds
and
divers
dogs
of
the
chase
of
several
species
such
as
may
be
seen
in
that
fair
forest
where
the
fountain
springs
the
whole
of
this
composition
was
enclosed
in
an
oblong
each
angle
of
which
contained
a
victory
in
holding
torches
after
the
manner
of
the
ancients
above
the
oblong
was
a
salamander
the
particular
device
with
many
other
ornaments
appropriate
to
the
ionic
architecture
of
the
whole
design
note
cellini
refers
to
the
renewal
of
hostilities
in
may
xxii
when
the
king
had
seen
this
model
it
restored
him
to
cheerfulness
and
distracted
his
mind
from
the
fatiguing
debates
he
had
been
holding
during
the
past
two
hours
seeing
him
cheerful
as
i
wished
i
uncovered
the
other
model
which
he
was
far
from
expecting
since
he
not
unreasonably
judged
that
the
first
had
work
in
it
enough
this
one
was
a
little
higher
than
two
cubits
it
figured
a
fountain
shaped
in
a
perfect
square
with
handsome
steps
all
round
intersecting
each
other
in
a
way
which
was
unknown
in
france
and
is
indeed
very
uncommon
in
italy
in
the
middle
of
the
fountain
i
set
a
pedestal
projecting
somewhat
above
the
margin
of
the
basin
and
upon
this
a
nude
male
figure
of
the
right
proportion
to
the
whole
design
and
of
a
very
graceful
form
in
his
right
hand
he
raised
a
broken
lance
on
high
his
left
hand
rested
on
a
scimitar
he
was
poised
upon
the
left
foot
the
right
being
supported
by
a
helmet
of
the
richest
imaginable
workmanship
at
each
of
the
four
angles
of
the
fountain
a
figure
was
sitting
raised
above
the
level
of
the
base
and
accompanied
by
many
beautiful
and
appropriate
emblems
the
king
began
by
asking
me
what
i
meant
to
represent
by
the
fine
fancy
i
had
embodied
in
this
design
saying
that
he
had
understood
the
door
without
explanation
but
that
he
could
not
take
the
conception
of
my
fountain
although
it
seemed
to
him
most
beautiful
at
the
same
time
he
knew
well
that
i
was
not
like
those
foolish
folk
who
turn
out
something
with
a
kind
of
grace
but
put
no
intention
into
their
performances
i
then
addressed
myself
to
the
task
of
exposition
for
having
succeeded
in
pleasing
him
with
my
work
i
wanted
him
to
be
no
less
pleased
with
my
discourse
me
inform
your
sacred
majesty
i
thus
began
the
whole
of
this
model
is
so
exactly
made
to
scale
that
if
it
should
come
to
being
executed
in
the
large
none
of
its
grace
and
lightness
will
be
sacrificed
the
figure
in
the
middle
is
meant
to
stand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
at
this
announcement
the
king
made
a
sign
of
surprise
is
moreover
intended
to
represent
the
god
mars
the
other
figures
embody
those
arts
and
sciences
in
which
your
majesty
takes
pleasure
and
which
you
so
generously
patronise
this
one
upon
the
right
hand
is
designed
for
learning
you
will
observe
that
the
accompanying
emblems
indicate
philosophy
and
her
attendant
branches
of
knowledge
by
the
next
i
wished
to
personify
the
whole
art
of
design
including
sculpture
painting
and
architecture
the
third
is
music
which
can
not
be
omitted
from
the
sphere
of
intellectual
culture
that
other
with
so
gracious
and
benign
a
mien
stands
for
generosity
lacking
which
the
mental
gifts
bestowed
on
us
by
god
will
not
be
brought
to
view
i
have
attempted
to
portray
your
majesty
your
very
self
in
the
great
central
statue
for
you
are
truly
a
god
mars
the
only
brave
upon
this
globe
and
all
your
bravery
you
use
with
justice
and
with
piety
in
the
defence
of
your
own
scarcely
had
he
allowed
me
to
finish
this
oration
when
he
broke
forth
with
a
strong
voice
i
have
found
a
man
here
after
my
own
then
he
called
the
treasurers
who
were
appointed
for
my
supplies
and
told
them
to
disburse
whatever
i
required
let
the
cost
be
what
it
might
next
he
laid
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
saying
ami
which
is
the
same
as
friend
i
know
not
whether
the
pleasure
be
greater
for
the
prince
who
finds
a
man
after
his
own
heart
or
for
the
artist
who
finds
a
prince
willing
to
furnish
him
with
means
for
carrying
out
his
great
i
answered
that
if
i
was
really
the
man
his
majesty
described
my
good
fortune
was
by
far
the
greater
he
answered
laughingly
us
agree
then
that
our
luck
is
equal
then
i
departed
in
the
highest
spirits
and
went
back
to
my
work
xxiii
my
willed
that
i
was
not
enough
to
play
the
like
comedy
with
madame
that
evening
when
she
heard
the
whole
course
of
events
from
the
own
lips
it
bred
such
poisonous
fury
in
her
breast
that
she
exclaimed
with
anger
benvenuto
had
shown
me
those
fine
things
of
his
he
would
have
given
me
some
reason
to
be
mindful
of
him
at
the
proper
the
king
sought
to
excuse
me
but
he
made
no
impression
on
her
temper
being
informed
of
what
had
passed
i
waited
fifteen
days
during
which
they
made
a
tour
through
normandy
visiting
rouen
and
dieppe
then
when
they
returned
to
i
took
the
handsome
little
vase
which
i
had
made
at
the
request
of
madame
hoping
if
i
gave
it
her
to
recover
the
favour
i
had
lost
with
this
in
my
hand
then
i
announced
my
presence
to
her
nurse
and
showed
the
gift
which
i
had
brought
her
mistress
the
woman
received
me
with
demonstrations
of
and
said
that
she
would
speak
a
word
to
madame
who
was
still
engaged
upon
her
toilette
i
should
be
admitted
on
the
instant
when
she
had
discharged
her
embassy
the
nurse
made
her
report
in
full
to
madame
who
retorted
scornfully
him
to
on
hearing
this
i
clothed
myself
with
patience
which
of
all
things
i
find
the
most
difficult
nevertheless
i
kept
myself
under
control
until
the
hour
for
dinner
was
past
then
seeing
that
time
dragged
on
and
being
maddened
by
hunger
i
could
no
longer
hold
out
but
flung
off
sending
her
most
devoutly
to
the
devil
i
next
betook
myself
to
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
and
made
him
a
present
of
the
vase
only
petitioning
his
eminence
to
maintain
me
in
the
good
graces
he
said
there
was
no
need
for
this
and
if
there
were
need
he
would
gladly
speak
for
me
then
he
called
his
treasurer
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
the
treasurer
waited
till
i
took
my
leave
of
the
cardinal
after
which
he
said
to
me
come
with
me
and
i
will
give
you
a
glass
of
good
wine
to
i
answered
not
understanding
what
he
meant
sake
treasurer
let
me
have
but
one
glass
of
wine
and
a
mouthful
of
bread
for
i
am
really
fainting
for
want
of
food
i
have
fasted
since
early
this
morning
up
to
the
present
moment
at
the
door
of
madame
i
went
to
give
her
that
fine
piece
of
plate
and
took
pains
that
she
would
be
informed
of
my
intention
but
she
with
the
mere
petty
will
to
vex
me
bade
me
wait
now
i
am
famished
and
feel
my
forces
failing
and
as
god
willed
it
i
have
bestowed
my
gift
and
labour
upon
one
who
is
far
more
worthy
of
them
i
only
crave
of
you
something
to
drink
for
being
rather
too
bilious
by
nature
fast
upsets
me
so
that
i
run
the
risk
now
of
falling
from
exhaustion
to
the
while
i
was
pumping
out
these
words
with
difficulty
they
brought
some
admirable
wine
and
other
delicacies
for
a
hearty
meal
i
refreshed
myself
and
having
recovered
my
vital
spirits
found
that
my
exasperation
had
departed
from
me
the
good
treasurer
handed
me
a
hundred
crowns
in
gold
i
sturdily
refused
to
accept
them
he
reported
this
to
the
cardinal
who
swore
at
him
and
told
him
to
make
me
take
the
money
by
force
and
not
to
show
himself
again
till
he
had
done
so
the
treasurer
returned
much
irritated
saying
he
had
never
been
so
scolded
before
by
the
cardinal
but
when
he
pressed
the
crowns
upon
me
i
still
offered
some
resistance
then
quite
angry
he
said
he
would
use
force
to
make
me
take
them
so
i
accepted
the
money
when
i
wanted
to
thank
the
cardinal
in
person
he
sent
word
by
one
of
his
secretaries
that
he
would
gladly
do
me
a
service
whenever
the
occasion
offered
i
returned
the
same
evening
to
paris
the
king
heard
the
whole
history
and
madame
was
well
laughed
at
in
their
company
this
increased
her
animosity
against
me
and
led
to
an
attack
upon
my
life
of
which
i
shall
speak
in
the
proper
time
and
place
xxiv
far
back
in
my
autobiography
i
ought
to
have
recorded
the
friendship
which
i
won
with
the
most
cultivated
the
most
affectionate
and
the
most
companionable
man
of
worth
i
ever
knew
in
this
world
he
was
messer
guido
guidi
an
able
physician
and
doctor
of
medicine
and
a
nobleman
of
florence
the
infinite
troubles
brought
upon
me
by
my
evil
fortune
caused
me
to
omit
the
mention
of
him
at
an
earlier
date
and
though
my
remembrance
may
be
but
a
trifle
i
deemed
it
sufficient
to
keep
him
always
in
my
heart
yet
finding
that
the
drama
of
my
life
requires
his
presence
i
shall
introduce
him
here
at
the
moment
of
my
greatest
trials
in
order
that
as
he
was
then
my
comfort
and
support
i
may
now
recall
to
memory
the
good
he
did
me
well
then
messer
guido
came
to
paris
and
not
long
after
making
his
acquaintance
i
took
him
to
my
castle
and
there
assigned
him
his
own
suite
of
apartments
we
enjoyed
our
lives
together
in
that
place
for
several
years
the
bishop
of
pavia
that
is
to
say
monsignore
rossi
brother
of
the
count
of
san
secondo
also
arrived
this
gentleman
i
removed
from
his
hotel
and
took
him
to
my
castle
assigning
him
in
like
manner
his
own
suite
of
apartments
where
he
sojourned
many
months
with
and
horses
on
another
occasion
i
lodged
messer
luigi
alamanni
and
his
sons
for
some
months
it
was
indeed
grace
to
me
that
i
should
thus
in
my
poor
station
be
able
to
render
services
to
men
of
great
position
and
acquirements
but
to
return
to
messer
guido
we
enjoyed
our
mutual
friendship
during
all
the
years
i
stayed
in
paris
and
often
did
we
exult
together
on
being
able
to
advance
in
art
and
knowledge
at
the
cost
of
that
so
great
and
admirable
prince
our
patron
each
in
his
own
branch
of
industry
i
can
indeed
and
with
good
conscience
affirm
that
all
i
am
whatever
of
good
and
beautiful
i
have
produced
all
this
must
be
ascribed
to
that
extraordinary
monarch
so
then
i
will
resume
the
thread
of
my
discourse
concerning
him
and
the
great
things
i
wrought
for
him
note
son
of
giuliano
guidi
and
costanza
a
daughter
of
domenico
ghirlandajo
françois
i
sent
for
him
some
time
before
appointed
him
his
own
physician
and
professor
of
medicine
in
the
royal
college
he
returned
to
florence
in
note
qui
mi
faccia
memoria
di
quel
bene
this
is
obscure
may
mean
happiness
of
his
friendship
note
we
have
already
met
with
him
in
the
castle
of
angelo
his
brother
the
count
was
general
in
the
french
army
this
brought
the
bishop
to
paris
whence
he
returned
to
italy
in
xxv
i
had
a
in
my
castle
from
which
i
drew
considerable
profit
the
building
also
contained
some
little
dwellings
inhabited
by
different
sorts
of
men
among
whom
was
a
printer
of
books
of
much
excellence
in
his
own
trade
nearly
the
whole
of
his
premises
lay
inside
the
castle
and
he
was
the
man
who
printed
messer
first
fine
book
on
medicine
wanting
to
make
use
of
his
lodging
i
turned
him
out
but
not
without
some
trouble
there
was
also
a
manufacturer
of
saltpetre
and
when
i
wished
to
assign
his
apartments
to
some
of
my
german
workmen
the
fellow
refused
to
leave
the
place
i
asked
him
over
and
over
again
in
gentle
terms
to
give
me
up
my
rooms
because
i
wanted
to
employ
them
for
my
in
the
service
of
the
king
the
more
moderately
i
spoke
the
more
arrogantly
did
the
brute
reply
till
at
last
i
gave
him
three
notice
to
quit
he
laughed
me
in
the
face
and
said
that
he
would
begin
to
think
of
it
at
the
end
of
three
years
i
had
not
then
learned
that
he
was
under
the
protection
of
madame
but
had
it
not
been
that
the
terms
on
which
i
stood
toward
that
lady
made
me
a
little
more
circumspect
than
i
was
wont
to
be
i
should
have
ousted
him
at
once
now
however
i
thought
it
best
to
keep
my
temper
for
three
days
when
the
term
was
over
i
said
nothing
but
took
germans
italians
and
frenchmen
bearing
arms
and
many
whom
i
had
in
my
employ
and
in
a
short
while
gutted
all
his
house
and
flung
his
property
outside
my
castle
i
resorted
to
these
somewhat
rigorous
measures
because
he
had
told
me
that
no
italian
whom
he
knew
of
had
the
power
of
spirit
to
remove
one
ring
of
iron
from
its
place
in
his
house
well
after
the
deed
was
done
he
came
to
find
me
and
i
said
to
him
am
the
least
of
all
italians
in
italy
and
yet
i
have
done
nothing
to
you
in
comparison
with
what
i
have
the
heart
to
do
and
will
do
if
you
utter
a
single
further
word
adding
other
terms
of
menace
and
abuse
the
man
dumbfounded
and
affrighted
got
his
furniture
together
as
well
as
he
was
able
then
he
ran
off
to
madame
and
painted
a
picture
of
me
like
the
very
fiend
she
being
my
great
enemy
painted
my
portrait
still
blacker
to
the
king
with
all
her
greater
eloquence
and
all
her
greater
weight
of
influence
as
i
was
afterwards
informed
his
majesty
twice
showed
signs
of
irritation
and
was
minded
to
use
me
roughly
but
henry
the
dauphin
his
son
now
king
of
france
who
had
received
some
affronts
from
that
imperious
woman
together
with
the
queen
of
navarre
sister
to
king
francis
espoused
my
cause
so
cleverly
that
he
passed
the
matter
over
with
a
laugh
so
with
assistance
i
escaped
from
a
great
danger

this

was
pierre
sauthier
xxvi
i
had
to
deal
in
like
manner
with
another
fellow
but
i
did
not
ruin
his
house
i
only
threw
all
his
furniture
out
of
doors
this
time
madame
had
the
insolence
to
tell
the
king
believe
that
devil
will
sack
paris
one
of
these
the
king
answered
with
some
anger
that
i
was
only
quite
right
to
defend
myself
from
the
low
rabble
who
put
obstacles
in
the
way
of
my
serving
him
the
rage
of
this
vindictive
woman
kept
continually
on
the
increase
she
sent
for
a
painter
who
was
established
at
fontainebleau
where
the
king
resided
nearly
all
his
time
the
painter
was
an
italian
and
a
bolognese
known
then
as
il
bologna
his
right
name
however
was
francesco
primaticcio
madame
advised
him
to
beg
that
commission
for
the
fountain
which
his
majesty
had
given
me
adding
that
she
would
support
him
with
all
her
ability
and
upon
this
they
agreed
bologna
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
happiness
and
thought
himself
sure
of
the
affair
although
such
things
were
not
in
his
line
of
art
he
was
however
an
excellent
master
of
design
and
had
collected
round
him
a
troop
of
formed
in
the
school
of
rosso
our
florentine
painter
who
was
undoubtedly
an
artist
of
extraordinary
merit
his
own
best
qualities
indeed
were
derived
from
the
admirable
manner
of
rosso
who
by
this
time
had
died
these
ingenious
arguments
and
the
weighty
influence
of
madame
prevailed
with
the
king
for
they
kept
hammering
at
him
night
and
day
madame
at
one
time
and
bologna
at
another
what
worked
most
upon
his
mind
was
that
both
of
them
combined
to
speak
as
follows
is
it
possible
sacred
majesty
that
benvenuto
should
accomplish
the
twelve
silver
statues
which
you
want
he
has
not
finished
one
of
them
yet
if
you
employ
him
on
so
great
an
undertaking
you
will
of
necessity
deprive
yourself
of
those
other
things
on
which
your
heart
is
set
a
hundred
of
the
ablest
craftsmen
could
not
complete
so
many
great
works
as
this
one
able
man
has
taken
in
hand
to
do
one
can
see
clearly
that
he
has
a
passion
for
labour
but
this
ardent
temper
will
be
the
cause
of
your
losing
both
him
and
his
masterpieces
at
the
same
by
insinuating
these
and
other
suggestions
of
the
same
sort
at
a
favourable
opportunity
the
king
consented
to
their
petition
and
yet
bologna
had
at
this
time
produced
neither
designs
nor
models
for
the
fountain
note
primaticcio
together
with
rosso
introduced
italian
painting
into
france
vasari
says
he
came
to
paris
in
he
died
in
he
was
like
many
other
of
the
lombard
artists
an
excellent
master
of
stucco
xxvii
it
happened
that
just
at
this
period
an
action
was
brought
against
me
in
paris
by
the
second
lodger
i
had
ousted
from
my
castle
who
pretended
that
on
that
occasion
i
had
stolen
a
large
quantity
of
his
effects
this
lawsuit
tormented
me
beyond
measure
and
took
up
so
much
of
my
time
that
i
often
thought
of
decamping
in
despair
from
the
country
now
the
french
are
in
the
habit
of
making
much
capital
out
of
any
action
they
commence
against
a
foreigner
or
against
such
persons
as
they
notice
to
be
indolent
in
litigation
no
sooner
do
they
observe
that
they
are
getting
some
advantage
in
the
suit
than
they
find
the
means
to
sell
it
some
have
even
been
known
to
give
a
lawsuit
in
dowry
with
their
daughters
to
men
who
make
a
business
out
of
such
transactions
they
have
another
ugly
custom
which
is
that
the
normans
nearly
all
of
them
traffic
in
false
evidence
so
that
the
men
who
buy
up
lawsuits
engage
at
once
the
services
of
four
or
six
of
these
false
witnesses
according
to
their
need
their
adversary
if
he
neglect
to
produce
as
many
on
the
other
side
being
perhaps
unacquainted
with
the
custom
is
certain
to
have
the
verdict
given
against
him
all
this
happened
in
my
case
and
thinking
it
a
most
disgraceful
breach
of
justice
i
made
my
appearance
in
the
great
hall
of
paris
to
defend
my
right
there
i
saw
a
judge
lieutenant
for
the
king
in
civil
causes
enthroned
upon
a
high
tribunal
he
was
tall
stout
and
fat
and
of
an
extremely
severe
countenance
all
round
him
on
each
side
stood
a
crowd
of
solicitors
and
advocates
ranged
upon
the
right
hand
and
the
left
others
were
coming
one
by
one
to
explain
their
several
causes
to
the
judge
from
time
to
time
too
i
noticed
that
the
attorneys
at
the
side
of
the
tribunal
talked
all
at
once
and
much
admiration
was
roused
in
me
by
that
extraordinary
man
the
very
image
of
pluto
who
listened
with
marked
attention
first
to
one
and
then
to
the
other
answering
each
with
learning
and
sagacity
i
have
always
delighted
in
watching
and
experiencing
every
kind
of
skill
so
i
would
not
have
lost
this
spectacle
for
much
it
happened
that
the
hall
being
very
large
and
filled
with
a
multitude
of
folk
they
were
strict
in
excluding
every
one
who
had
no
business
there
and
kept
the
door
shut
with
a
guard
to
hold
it
sometimes
the
guardian
in
his
effort
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
some
improper
person
interrupted
the
judge
by
the
great
noise
he
made
and
the
judge
in
anger
turned
to
chide
him
this
happened
frequently
so
that
my
attention
was
directed
to
the
fact
on
one
occasion
when
two
gentlemen
were
pushing
their
way
in
as
spectators
and
the
porter
was
opposing
them
with
violence
the
judge
raised
his
voice
and
spoke
the
following
words
precisely
as
i
heard
them
peace
satan
begone
and
hold
your
these
words
in
the
french
tongue
sound
as
follows
phe
satan
phe
phe
alé
phe
now
i
had
learned
the
french
tongue
well
and
on
hearing
this
sentence
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
used
by
dante
came
into
my
memory
when
he
and
his
master
virgil
entered
the
doors
of
hell
dante
and
the
painter
giotto
were
together
in
france
and
particularly
in
the
city
of
paris
where
owing
to
the
circumstances
i
have
just
described
the
hall
of
justice
may
be
truly
called
a
hell
dante
then
who
also
understood
french
well
made
use
of
the
phrase
in
question
and
it
has
struck
me
as
singular
that
this
interpretation
has
never
yet
been
put
upon
the
passage
indeed
it
confirms
my
opinion
that
the
commentators
make
him
say
things
which
never
came
into
his
head
note
paix
satan
allez
paix
the
line
in
dante
to
which
cellini
alludes
is
the
first
of
the
seventh
canto
of
the
his
suggestion
is
both
curious
and
ingenious
but
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
french
judges
used
the
same
imprecations
when
interrupted
in
the
thirteenth
as
they
did
in
the
sixteenth
century
or
that
what
cellini
heard
on
this
occasion
was
more
than
an
accidental
similarity
of
sounds
striking
his
quick
ear
and
awakening
his
lively
memory
xxviii
well
then
to
return
to
my
affairs
when
certain
decisions
of
the
court
were
sent
me
by
those
lawyers
and
i
perceived
that
my
cause
had
been
unjustly
lost
i
had
recourse
for
my
defence
to
a
great
dagger
which
i
carried
for
i
have
always
taken
pleasure
in
keeping
fine
weapons
the
first
man
i
attacked
was
the
plaintiff
who
had
sued
me
and
one
evening
i
wounded
him
in
the
legs
and
arms
so
severely
taking
care
however
not
to
kill
him
that
i
deprived
him
of
the
use
of
both
his
legs
then
i
sought
out
the
other
fellow
who
had
brought
the
suit
and
used
him
also
in
such
wise
that
he
dropped
it
returning
thanks
to
god
for
this
and
every
other
dispensation
and
hoping
to
be
left
awhile
without
worries
i
bade
the
young
men
of
my
household
especially
the
italians
for
sake
to
attend
each
diligently
to
the
work
i
set
him
and
to
help
me
till
such
time
as
i
could
finish
the
things
i
had
in
hand
i
thought
they
might
soon
be
completed
and
then
i
meant
to
return
to
italy
being
no
longer
able
to
put
up
with
the
rogueries
of
those
frenchmen
the
good
king
too
if
he
once
grew
angry
might
bring
me
into
mischief
for
many
of
my
acts
in
i
will
describe
who
these
italians
were
the
first
and
the
one
i
liked
best
was
ascanio
from
tagliacozzo
in
the
kingdom
of
naples
the
second
was
pagolo
a
roman
of
such
humble
origin
that
he
did
now
know
his
own
father
these
were
the
two
men
who
had
been
with
me
in
rome
and
whom
i
had
taken
with
me
on
the
journey
another
roman
had
also
come
on
purpose
to
enter
my
service
he
too
bore
the
name
of
pagolo
and
was
the
son
of
a
poor
nobleman
of
the
family
of
the
macaroni
he
had
small
acquirements
in
our
art
but
was
an
excellent
and
courageous
swordsman
i
had
another
from
ferrara
called
bartolommeo
chioccia
there
was
also
another
from
florence
named
pagolo
micceri
his
brother
nicknamed
gatta
was
a
clever
clerk
but
had
spent
too
much
money
in
managing
the
property
of
tommaso
guadagni
a
very
wealthy
merchant
this
gatta
put
in
order
for
me
the
books
in
which
i
wrote
the
accounts
of
his
most
christian
majesty
and
my
other
employers
now
pagolo
micceri
having
learned
how
to
keep
them
from
his
brother
went
on
doing
this
work
for
me
in
return
for
a
liberal
salary
he
appeared
so
far
as
i
could
judge
to
be
a
very
honest
lad
for
i
noticed
him
to
be
devout
and
when
i
heard
him
sometimes
muttering
psalms
and
sometimes
telling
his
beads
i
reckoned
much
upon
his
feigned
virtue
accordingly
i
called
the
fellow
apart
and
said
to
him
my
dearest
brother
you
know
what
a
good
place
you
have
with
me
and
how
you
had
formerly
nothing
to
depend
on
besides
you
are
a
florentine
i
have
also
the
greater
confidence
in
you
because
i
observe
that
you
are
pious
and
religious
which
is
a
thing
that
pleases
me
i
beg
you
therefore
to
assist
me
for
i
can
not
put
the
same
trust
in
any
of
your
companions
so
then
i
shall
ask
you
to
keep
watch
over
two
matters
of
the
highest
importance
which
might
prove
a
source
of
much
annoyance
to
me
in
the
first
place
i
want
you
to
guard
my
property
from
being
stolen
and
not
touch
it
yourself
in
the
next
place
you
know
that
poor
young
girl
caterina
i
keep
her
principally
for
my
sake
since
i
can
not
do
without
a
model
but
being
a
man
also
i
have
used
her
for
my
pleasures
and
it
is
possible
that
she
may
bear
me
a
child
now
i
do
not
want
to
maintain
another
bastards
nor
will
i
sit
down
under
such
an
insult
if
any
one
in
this
house
had
the
audacity
to
attempt
anything
of
the
sort
and
i
were
to
become
aware
of
it
i
verily
believe
that
i
should
kill
both
her
and
him
accordingly
dear
brother
i
entreat
you
to
be
my
helper
should
you
notice
anything
tell
it
me
at
once
for
i
am
sure
to
send
her
and
her
mother
and
her
fellow
to
the
gallows
be
you
the
first
upon
your
watch
against
falling
into
this
the
rascal
made
a
sign
of
the
cross
from
his
head
to
his
feet
and
cried
out
blessed
jesus
god
preserve
me
from
ever
thinking
of
such
a
thing
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
given
to
those
evil
ways
in
the
next
place
do
you
imagine
i
am
ignorant
of
your
great
benefits
toward
me
when
i
heard
these
words
which
he
uttered
with
all
appearance
of
simplicity
and
affection
for
me
i
believed
that
matters
stood
precisely
as
he
asserted
xxix
two
days
after
this
conversation
mattio
del
nazaro
took
the
occasion
of
some
to
invite
me
and
my
workpeople
to
an
entertainment
in
a
garden
he
was
an
italian
in
the
service
and
practised
the
same
art
as
we
did
with
remarkable
ability
i
got
myself
in
readiness
and
told
pagolo
that
he
might
go
abroad
too
and
amuse
himself
with
us
the
annoyances
arising
from
that
lawsuit
being
as
i
judged
now
settled
down
the
young
man
replied
in
these
words
my
word
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
leave
the
house
so
unprotected
only
look
how
much
of
gold
silver
and
jewels
you
have
here
living
as
we
do
in
a
city
of
thieves
we
ought
to
be
upon
our
guard
by
day
and
night
i
will
spend
the
time
in
religious
exercises
while
i
keep
watch
over
the
premises
go
then
with
mind
at
rest
to
take
your
pleasure
and
divert
your
spirits
some
other
day
another
man
will
take
my
place
as
guardian
thinking
that
i
could
go
of
with
a
quiet
mind
i
took
pagolo
ascanio
and
chioccia
to
the
garden
where
we
spent
a
large
portion
of
the
day
agreeably
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
however
when
it
began
to
draw
toward
sundown
a
suspicion
came
into
my
head
and
i
recollected
the
words
which
that
traitor
had
spoken
with
his
feigned
simplicity
so
i
mounted
my
horse
and
with
two
servants
to
attend
me
returned
to
the
castle
where
i
all
but
caught
pagolo
and
that
little
wretch
caterina
flagrante
no
sooner
had
i
reached
the
place
than
that
french
bawd
her
mother
screamed
out
caterina
here
is
the
master
when
i
saw
the
pair
advancing
overcome
with
fright
their
clothes
in
disorder
not
knowing
what
they
said
nor
like
people
in
a
trance
where
they
were
going
it
was
only
too
easy
to
guess
what
they
had
been
about
the
sight
drowned
reason
in
rage
and
i
drew
my
sword
resolved
to
kill
them
both
the
man
took
to
his
heels
the
girl
flung
herself
upon
her
knees
and
shrieked
to
heaven
for
mercy
in
my
first
fury
i
wanted
to
strike
at
the
male
but
before
i
had
the
time
to
catch
him
up
second
thoughts
arose
which
made
me
think
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
drive
them
both
away
together
i
had
so
many
acts
of
violence
upon
my
hands
that
if
i
killed
him
i
could
hardly
hope
to
save
my
life
i
said
then
to
pagolo
i
seen
with
my
own
eyes
scoundrel
what
your
behaviour
and
appearance
force
me
to
believe
i
should
have
run
you
with
this
sword
here
ten
times
through
the
guts
get
out
of
my
sight
and
if
you
say
a
paternoster
let
it
be
san
then
i
drove
the
whole
lot
forth
mother
and
daughter
lamming
into
them
with
fist
and
foot
they
made
their
minds
up
to
have
the
law
of
me
and
consulted
a
norman
advocate
who
advised
them
to
declare
that
i
had
used
the
girl
after
the
italian
fashion
what
this
meant
i
need
hardly
explain
the
man
argued
the
very
least
when
this
italian
hears
what
you
are
after
he
will
pay
down
several
hundred
ducats
knowing
how
great
the
danger
is
and
how
heavily
that
offence
is
punished
in
upon
this
they
were
agreed
the
accusation
was
brought
against
me
and
i
received
a
summons
from
the
court
note
matteo
del
nassaro
a
native
of
verona
was
employed
in
france
as

the
more
i
sought
for
rest
the
more
i
was
annoyed
with
all
sorts
of
embarrassments
being
thus
daily
exposed
to
divers
persecutions
i
pondered
which
of
two
courses
i
ought
to
take
whether
to
decamp
and
leave
france
to
the
devil
or
else
to
fight
this
battle
through
as
i
had
done
the
rest
and
see
to
what
end
god
had
made
me
for
a
long
while
i
kept
anxiously
revolving
the
matter
at
last
i
resolved
to
make
off
dreading
to
tempt
my
evil
fortune
lest
this
should
bring
me
to
the
gallows
my
dispositions
were
all
fixed
i
had
made
arrangements
for
putting
away
the
property
i
could
not
carry
and
for
charging
the
lighter
articles
to
the
best
of
my
ability
upon
myself
and
servants
yet
it
was
with
great
and
heavy
reluctance
that
i
looked
forward
to
such
a
departure
i
had
shut
myself
up
alone
in
a
little
study
my
young
men
were
advising
me
to
fly
but
i
told
them
that
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
meditate
this
step
in
solitude
although
i
very
much
inclined
to
their
opinion
indeed
i
reasoned
that
if
i
could
escape
imprisonment
and
let
the
storm
pass
over
i
should
be
able
to
explain
matters
to
the
king
by
letter
setting
forth
the
trap
which
had
been
laid
to
ruin
me
by
the
malice
of
my
enemies
and
as
i
have
said
above
my
mind
was
made
up
to
this
point
when
just
as
i
rose
to
act
on
the
decision
some
power
took
me
by
the
shoulder
and
turned
me
round
and
i
heard
a
voice
which
cried
with
vehemence
do
as
thou
art
wont
and
fear
not
then
on
the
instant
i
changed
the
whole
course
of
my
plans
and
said
to
my
italians
your
good
arms
and
come
with
me
obey
me
to
the
letter
have
no
other
thought
for
i
am
now
determined
to
put
in
my
appearance
if
i
were
to
leave
paris
you
would
vanish
the
next
day
in
smoke
so
do
as
i
command
and
follow
they
all
began
together
with
one
heart
and
voice
to
say
we
are
here
and
draw
our
livelihood
from
him
it
is
our
duty
to
go
with
him
and
bear
him
out
so
long
as
we
have
life
to
execute
what
he
proposes
he
has
hit
the
mark
better
than
we
did
in
this
matter
for
on
the
instant
when
he
leaves
the
place
his
enemies
will
send
us
to
the
devil
let
us
keep
well
in
mind
what
great
works
we
have
begun
here
and
what
vast
importance
they
possess
we
should
not
know
how
to
finish
them
without
him
and
his
enemies
would
say
that
he
had
taken
flight
because
he
shrank
before
such
many
other
things
bearing
weightily
upon
the
subject
were
said
among
them
but
it
was
the
young
roman
macaroni
who
first
put
heart
into
the
company
and
he
also
raised
recruits
from
the
germans
and
the
frenchmen
who
felt
well
disposed
toward
me
we
were
ten
men
all
counted
i
set
out
firmly
resolved
not
to
let
myself
be
taken
and
imprisoned
alive
when
we
appeared
before
the
judges
for
criminal
affairs
i
found
caterina
and
her
mother
waiting
and
on
the
moment
of
my
arrival
the
two
women
were
laughing
with
their
advocate
i
pushed
my
way
in
and
called
boldly
for
the
judge
who
was
seated
blown
out
big
and
fat
upon
a
tribunal
high
above
the
rest
on
catching
sight
of
me
he
threatened
with
his
head
and
spoke
in
a
subdued
voice
your
name
is
benvenuto
this
time
you
are
an
i
understood
his
speech
and
called
out
the
second
time
my
business
quickly
tell
me
what
i
have
come
to
do
then
the
judge
turned
to
caterina
and
said
relate
all
that
happened
between
you
and
she
answered
that
i
had
used
her
after
the
italian
fashion
the
judge
turned
to
me
and
said
hear
what
caterina
deposes
i
replied
i
have
consorted
with
her
after
the
italian
fashion
i
have
only
done
the
same
as
you
folk
of
other
nations
he
demurred
means
that
you
improperly
abused
i
retorted
that
so
far
from
being
the
italian
fashion
it
must
be
some
french
habit
seeing
she
knew
all
about
it
while
i
was
ignorant
and
i
commanded
her
to
explain
precisely
how
i
had
consorted
with
her
then
the
impudent
baggage
entered
into
plain
and
circumstantial
details
regarding
all
the
filth
she
lyingly
accused
me
of
i
made
her
repeat
her
deposition
three
times
in
succession
when
she
had
finished
i
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
judge
lieutenant
of
the
most
christian
king
i
call
on
you
for
justice
well
i
know
that
by
the
laws
of
his
most
christian
majesty
both
agent
and
patient
in
this
kind
of
crime
are
punished
with
the
stake
the
woman
confesses
her
guilt
i
admit
nothing
whatsoever
of
the
sort
with
regard
to
her
her
of
a
mother
is
here
who
deserves
to
be
burned
for
either
one
or
the
other
offence
therefore
i
appeal
to
you
for
these
words
i
repeated
over
and
over
again
at
the
top
of
my
voice
continually
calling
out
the
stake
with
her
and
her
mother
i
also
threatened
the
judge
that
if
he
did
not
send
her
to
prison
there
before
me
i
would
go
to
the
king
at
once
and
tell
him
how
his
lieutenant
in
criminal
affairs
of
justice
had
wronged
me
when
they
heard
what
a
tumult
i
was
making
my
adversaries
lowered
their
voices
but
i
lifted
mine
the
more
the
little
hussy
and
her
mother
fell
to
weeping
while
i
shouted
to
the
judge
fire
to
the
stake
with
them
the
coward
on
the
bench
finding
that
the
matter
was
not
going
as
he
intended
began
to
use
soft
words
and
excuse
the
weakness
of
the
female
sex
thereupon
i
felt
that
i
had
won
the
victory
in
a
nasty
encounter
and
muttering
threats
between
my
teeth
i
took
myself
off
not
without
great
inward
satisfaction
indeed
i
would
gladly
have
paid
five
hundred
crowns
down
to
have
avoided
that
appearance
in
court
however
after
escaping
from
the
tempest
i
thanked
god
with
all
my
heart
and
returned
in
gladness
with
my
young
men
to
the
castle
xxxi
when
adverse
fortune
or
if
we
prefer
to
call
it
our
malignant
planet
undertakes
to
persecute
a
man
it
never
lacks
new
ways
of
injuring
him
so
now
when
i
thought
i
had
emerged
from
this
tempestuous
sea
of
troubles
and
hoped
my
evil
star
would
leave
me
quiet
for
a
moment
it
began
to
set
two
schemes
in
motion
against
me
before
i
had
recovered
my
breath
from
that
great
struggle
within
three
days
two
things
happened
each
of
which
brought
my
life
into
extreme
hazard
one
of
these
occurred
in
this
way
i
went
to
fontainebleau
to
consult
with
the
king
for
he
had
written
me
a
letter
saying
he
wanted
me
to
stamp
the
coins
of
his
whole
realm
and
enclosing
some
little
drawings
to
explain
his
wishes
in
the
matter
at
the
same
time
he
left
me
free
to
execute
them
as
i
liked
upon
which
i
made
new
designs
according
to
my
own
conception
and
according
to
the
ideal
of
art
when
i
reached
fontainebleau
one
of
the
treasurers
commissioned
by
the
king
to
defray
my
expenses
he
was
called
monsignor
della
fa
addressed
me
in
these
words
the
painter
bologna
has
obtained
commission
from
the
king
to
execute
your
great
colossus
and
all
the
orders
previously
given
as
on
your
behalf
have
been
transferred
to
him
we
are
all
indignant
and
it
seems
to
us
that
that
countryman
of
yours
has
acted
towards
you
in
a
most
unwarrantable
manner
the
work
was
assigned
you
on
the
strength
of
your
models
and
studies
he
is
robbing
you
of
it
only
through
the
favour
of
madame
and
though
several
months
have
passed
since
he
received
the
order
he
has
not
yet
made
any
sign
of
commencing
i
answered
in
surprise
is
it
possible
that
i
should
have
heard
nothing
at
all
about
this
he
then
informed
me
that
the
man
had
kept
it
very
dark
and
had
obtained
the
commission
with
great
difficulty
since
his
majesty
at
first
would
not
concede
it
only
the
importunity
of
madame
secured
this
favour
for
him
when
i
felt
how
greatly
and
how
wrongfully
i
had
been
betrayed
and
saw
a
work
which
i
had
gained
with
my
great
toil
thus
stolen
from
me
i
made
my
mind
up
for
a
serious
stroke
of
business
and
marched
off
with
my
good
sword
at
my
side
to
find
bologna
he
was
in
his
room
engaged
in
studies
after
telling
the
servant
to
introduce
me
he
greeted
me
with
some
of
his
lombard
compliments
and
asked
what
good
business
had
brought
me
hither
i
replied
most
excellent
business
and
one
of
great
he
then
sent
for
wine
and
said
we
begin
to
talk
we
must
drink
together
for
such
is
the
french
i
answered
francesco
you
must
know
that
the
conversation
we
have
to
engage
in
does
not
call
for
drinking
at
the
commencement
after
it
is
over
perhaps
we
shall
be
glad
to
take
a
then
i
opened
the
matter
in
this
way
men
who
wish
to
pass
for
persons
of
worth
allow
it
to
be
seen
that
they
are
so
by
their
actions
if
they
do
the
contrary
they
lose
the
name
of
honest
men
i
am
aware
that
you
knew
the
king
had
commissioned
me
with
that
great
colossus
it
had
been
talked
of
these
eighteen
months
past
yet
neither
you
nor
anybody
else
came
forward
to
speak
a
word
about
it
by
my
great
labours
i
made
myself
known
to
his
majesty
who
approved
of
my
models
and
gave
the
work
into
my
hands
during
many
months
i
have
heard
nothing
to
the
contrary
only
this
morning
i
was
informed
that
you
have
got
hold
of
it
and
have
filched
it
from
me
i
earned
it
by
the
talents
i
displayed
and
you
are
robbing
me
of
it
merely
by
your
idle
note
his
name
in
full
was
jacques
de
la
fa
he
and
his
son
pierre
after
him
held
the
office
of

to
this
speech
bologna
answered
benvenuto
all
men
try
to
push
their
affairs
in
every
way
they
can
if
this
is
the
will
what
have
you
to
say
against
it
you
would
only
throw
away
your
time
because
i
have
it
now
and
it
is
mine
now
tell
me
what
you
choose
and
i
will
listen
to
i
replied
should
like
you
to
know
messer
francesco
that
i
could
say
much
which
would
prove
irrefragably
and
make
you
admit
that
such
ways
of
acting
as
you
have
described
and
used
are
not
in
vogue
among
rational
animals
i
will
however
come
quickly
to
the
point
at
issue
give
close
attention
to
my
meaning
because
the
affair
is
he
made
as
though
he
would
rise
form
the
chair
on
which
he
was
sitting
since
he
saw
my
colour
heightened
and
my
features
greatly
discomposed
i
told
him
that
the
time
had
not
yet
come
for
moving
he
had
better
sit
and
listen
to
me
then
i
recommenced
francesco
you
know
that
i
first
received
the
work
and
that
the
time
has
long
gone
by
during
which
my
right
could
be
reasonably
disputed
by
any
one
now
i
tell
you
that
i
shall
be
satisfied
if
you
will
make
a
model
while
i
make
another
in
addition
to
the
one
i
have
already
shown
then
we
will
take
them
without
any
clamour
to
our
great
king
and
whosoever
in
this
way
shall
have
gained
the
credit
of
the
best
design
will
justly
have
deserved
the
commission
if
it
falls
to
you
i
will
dismiss
from
my
mind
the
memory
of
the
great
injury
you
have
done
me
and
will
bless
your
hands
as
being
worthier
than
mine
of
so
glorious
a
performance
let
us
abide
by
this
agreement
and
we
shall
be
friends
otherwise
we
must
be
enemies
and
god
who
always
helps
the
right
and
i
who
know
how
to
assert
it
will
show
you
to
what
extent
you
have
done
messer
francesco
answered
work
is
mine
and
since
it
has
been
given
me
i
do
not
choose
to
put
what
is
my
own
to
to
this
i
retorted
francesco
if
you
will
not
take
the
right
course
which
is
just
and
reasonable
i
will
show
you
another
which
shall
be
like
your
own
that
is
to
say
ugly
and
disagreeable
i
tell
you
plainly
that
if
i
ever
hear
that
you
have
spoken
one
single
word
about
this
work
of
mine
i
will
kill
you
like
a
dog
we
are
neither
in
rome
nor
in
bologna
nor
in
florence
here
one
lives
in
quite
a
different
fashion
if
then
it
comes
to
my
ears
that
you
talk
about
this
to
the
king
or
anybody
else
i
vow
that
i
will
kill
you
reflect
upon
the
way
you
mean
to
take
whether
that
for
good
which
i
formerly
described
or
this
latter
bad
one
i
have
just
now
set
before
the
man
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
do
and
i
was
inclined
to
cut
the
matter
short
upon
the
spot
rather
than
to
postpone
action
bologna
found
no
other
words
than
these
to
utter
i
act
like
a
man
of
honesty
i
shall
stand
in
no
i
replied
have
spoken
well
but
if
you
act
otherwise
you
will
have
to
fear
because
the
affair
is
upon
this
i
left
him
and
betook
myself
to
the
king
with
his
majesty
i
disputed
some
time
about
the
fashion
of
his
coinage
a
point
upon
which
we
were
not
of
the
same
opinion
his
council
who
were
present
kept
persuading
him
that
the
monies
ought
to
be
struck
in
the
french
style
as
they
had
hitherto
always
been
done
i
urged
in
reply
that
his
majesty
had
sent
for
me
from
italy
in
order
that
i
might
execute
good
work
if
he
now
wanted
me
to
do
the
contrary
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
submit
so
the
matter
was
postponed
till
another
occasion
and
i
set
off
again
at
once
for
paris
xxxiii
i
had
but
just
dismounted
from
my
horse
when
one
of
those
excellent
people
who
rejoice
in
came
to
tell
me
that
pagolo
micceri
had
taken
a
house
for
the
little
hussy
caterina
and
her
mother
and
that
he
was
always
going
there
and
whenever
he
mentioned
me
used
words
of
scorn
to
this
effect
set
the
fox
to
watch
the
grapes
and
thought
i
would
not
eat
them
now
he
is
satisfied
with
going
about
and
talking
big
and
thinks
i
am
afraid
of
him
but
i
have
girt
this
sword
and
dagger
to
my
side
in
order
to
show
him
that
my
steel
can
cut
as
well
as
his
and
that
i
too
am
a
florentine
of
the
micceri
a
far
better
family
than
his
the
scoundrel
who
reported
this
poisonous
gossip
spoke
it
with
such
good
effect
that
i
felt
a
fever
in
the
instant
swoop
upon
me
and
when
i
say
fever
i
mean
fever
and
no
mere
metaphor
the
insane
passion
which
took
possession
of
me
might
have
been
my
death
had
i
not
resolved
to
give
it
vent
as
the
occasion
offered
i
ordered
the
ferrarese
workman
chioccia
to
come
with
me
and
made
a
servant
follow
with
my
horse
when
we
reached
the
house
where
that
worthless
villain
was
i
found
the
door
ajar
and
entered
i
noticed
that
he
carried
sword
and
dagger
and
was
sitting
on
a
big
chest
with
his
arm
round
neck
at
the
moment
of
my
arrival
i
could
hear
that
he
and
her
mother
were
talking
about
me
pushing
the
door
open
i
drew
my
sword
and
set
the
point
of
it
at
his
throat
not
giving
him
the
time
to
think
whether
he
too
carried
steel
at
the
same
instant
i
cried
out
coward
recommend
your
soul
to
god
for
you
are
a
dead
without
budging
from
his
seat
he
called
three
times
mother
help
me
though
i
had
come
there
fully
determined
to
take
his
life
half
my
fury
ebbed
away
when
i
heard
this
idiotic
exclamation
i
ought
to
add
that
i
had
told
chioccia
not
to
let
the
girl
or
her
mother
leave
the
house
since
i
meant
to
deal
with
those
trollops
after
i
had
disposed
of
their
bully
so
i
went
on
holding
my
sword
at
his
throat
and
now
and
then
just
pricked
him
with
the
point
pouring
out
a
torrent
of
terrific
threats
at
the
same
time
but
when
i
found
he
did
not
stir
a
finger
in
his
own
defence
i
began
to
wonder
what
i
should
do
next
my
menacing
attitude
could
not
be
kept
up
for
ever
so
at
last
it
came
into
my
head
to
make
them
marry
and
complete
my
vengeance
at
a
later
period
accordingly
i
formed
my
resolution
and
began
that
ring
coward
from
your
finger
and
marry
her
that
i
may
get
satisfaction
from
you
afterwards
according
to
your
he
replied
at
once
only
you
do
not
kill
me
i
will
do
whatever
you
said
i
that
ring
upon
her
when
the
point
was
withdrawn
a
few
inches
from
his
throat
he
wedded
her
with
the
ring
but
i
added
is
not
enough
i
shall
send
for
two
notaries
in
order
that
the
marriage
may
be
ratified
by
bidding
chioccia
go
for
the
lawyers
i
turned
to
the
girl
and
her
mother
and
using
the
french
language
spoke
as
follows
and
witnesses
are
coming
the
first
of
you
who
blabs
about
this
affair
will
be
killed
upon
the
spot
nay
i
will
murder
you
all
three
so
beware
and
keep
a
quiet
tongue
in
your
to
him
i
said
in
italian
you
offer
any
resistance
to
what
i
shall
propose
upon
the
slightest
word
you
utter
i
will
stab
you
till
your
guts
run
out
upon
this
he
answered
promise
not
to
kill
me
and
i
will
do
whatever
you
the
notaries
and
witnesses
arrived
a
contract
valid
and
in
due
form
was
drawn
up
then
my
heat
and
fever
left
me
i
paid
the
lawyers
and
took
my
departure
on
the
following
day
bologna
came
to
paris
on
purpose
and
sent
for
me
through
mattio
del
nasaro
i
went
to
see
him
and
he
met
me
with
a
glad
face
entreating
me
to
regard
him
as
a
brother
and
saying
that
he
would
never
speak
about
that
work
again
since
he
recognised
quite
well
that
i
was
right
note
dato
a
guardia
la
lattuga
ai
paperi
xxxiv
if
i
did
not
confess
that
in
some
of
these
episodes
i
acted
wrongly
the
world
might
think
i
was
not
telling
the
truth
about
those
in
which
i
say
i
acted
rightly
therefore
i
admit
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
inflict
so
singular
a
vengeance
upon
pagolo
micceri
in
truth
had
i
believed
him
to
be
so
utterly
feeble
i
should
not
have
conceived
the
notion
of
branding
him
with
such
infamy
as
i
am
going
to
relate
not
satisfied
with
having
made
him
take
a
vicious
drab
to
wife
i
completed
my
revenge
by
inviting
her
to
sit
to
me
as
a
model
and
dealing
with
her
thus
i
gave
her
thirty
sous
a
day
paid
in
advance
and
a
good
meal
and
obliged
her
to
pose
before
me
naked
then
i
made
her
serve
my
pleasure
out
of
spite
against
her
husband
jeering
at
them
both
the
while
furthermore
i
kept
her
for
hours
together
in
position
greatly
to
her
discomfort
this
gave
her
as
much
annoyance
as
it
gave
me
pleasure
for
she
was
beautifully
made
and
brought
me
much
credit
as
a
model
at
last
noticing
that
i
did
not
treat
her
with
the
same
consideration
as
before
her
marriage
she
began
to
grumble
and
talk
big
in
her
french
way
about
her
husband
who
was
now
serving
the
prior
of
capua
a
brother
of
piero
strozzi
on
the
first
occasion
when
she
did
this
the
mere
mention
of
the
fellow
aroused
me
to
intolerable
fury
still
i
bore
it
greatly
against
the
grain
as
well
as
i
was
able
reflecting
that
i
could
hardly
find
so
suitable
a
subject
for
my
art
as
she
was
so
i
reasoned
thus
in
my
own
mind
am
now
taking
two
different
kinds
of
revenge
in
the
first
place
she
is
married
and
what
i
am
doing
to
her
husband
is
something
far
more
serious
than
what
he
did
to
me
when
she
was
only
a
girl
of
loose
life
if
then
i
wreak
my
spite
so
fully
upon
him
while
upon
her
i
inflict
the
discomfort
of
posing
in
such
strange
attitudes
for
such
a
length
of
time
which
beside
the
pleasure
i
derive
brings
me
both
profit
and
credit
through
my
art
what
more
can
i
desire
while
i
was
turning
over
these
calculations
the
wretch
redoubled
her
insulting
speeches
always
prating
big
about
her
husband
till
she
goaded
me
beyond
the
bounds
of
reason
yielding
myself
up
to
blind
rage
i
seized
her
by
the
hair
and
dragged
her
up
and
down
my
room
beating
and
kicking
her
till
i
was
tired
there
was
no
one
who
could
come
to
her
assistance
when
i
had
well
pounded
her
she
swore
that
she
would
never
visit
me
again
then
for
the
first
time
i
perceived
that
i
had
acted
very
wrongly
for
i
was
losing
a
grand
model
who
brought
me
honour
through
my
art
moreover
when
i
saw
her
body
all
torn
and
bruised
and
swollen
i
reflected
that
even
if
i
persuaded
her
to
return
i
should
have
to
put
her
under
medical
treatment
for
at
least
a
fortnight
before
i
could
make
use
of
her
note
leone
son
of
filippo
strozzi
knight
of
jerusalem
and
prior
of
capua
was
like
his
brother
piero
a
distinguished
french
general
xxxv
well
to
return
to
caterina
i
sent
my
old
named
ruberta
who
had
a
most
kindly
disposition
to
help
her
dress
she
brought
food
and
drink
to
the
miserable
baggage
and
after
rubbing
a
little
bacon
fat
into
her
worst
wounds
they
ate
what
was
left
of
the
meat
together
when
she
had
finished
dressing
she
went
off
blaspheming
and
cursing
all
italians
in
the
service
and
so
returned
with
tears
and
murmurs
to
her
home
assuredly
upon
that
first
occasion
i
felt
i
had
done
very
wrong
and
ruberta
rebuked
me
after
this
fashion
are
a
cruel
monster
to
maltreat
such
a
handsome
girl
so
when
i
excused
my
conduct
by
narrating
all
the
tricks
which
she
and
her
mother
had
played
off
upon
me
under
my
own
roof
ruberta
scoldingly
replied
that
was
nothing
that
was
only
french
manners
and
she
was
sure
there
was
not
a
husband
in
france
without
his
horns
when
i
heard
this
argument
i
laughed
aloud
and
then
told
ruberta
to
go
and
see
how
caterina
was
since
i
should
like
to
employ
her
again
while
finishing
the
work
i
had
on
hand
the
old
woman
took
me
sharply
up
saying
that
i
had
no
vivre
wait
till
daybreak
and
she
will
come
of
herself
whereas
if
you
send
to
ask
after
her
or
visit
her
she
will
give
herself
airs
and
keep
on
the
following
morning
caterina
came
to
our
door
and
knocked
so
violently
that
being
below
i
ran
to
see
whether
it
was
a
madman
or
some
member
of
the
household
when
i
opened
the
creature
laughed
and
fell
upon
my
neck
embracing
and
kissing
me
and
asked
me
if
i
was
still
angry
with
her
i
said
then
she
added
me
have
something
good
to
break
my
fast
so
i
supplied
her
well
with
food
and
partook
of
it
at
the
same
table
in
sign
of
reconciliation
afterwards
i
began
to
model
from
her
during
which
occurred
some
amorous
diversions
and
at
last
just
at
the
same
hour
as
on
the
previous
day
she
irritated
me
to
such
a
pitch
that
i
gave
her
the
same
drubbing
so
we
went
on
several
days
repeating
the
old
round
like
clockwork
there
was
little
or
no
variation
in
the
incidents
meanwhile
i
completed
my
work
in
a
style
which
did
me
the
greatest
credit
next
i
set
about
to
cast
it
in
bronze
this
entailed
some
difficulties
to
relate
which
would
be
interesting
from
the
point
of
view
of
art
but
since
the
whole
history
would
occupy
too
much
space
i
must
omit
it
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
figure
came
out
splendidly
and
was
as
fine
a
specimen
of
foundry
as
had
ever
been
seen
note
this
figure
was
undoubtedly
the
nymph
of
fontainebleau
xxxvi
while
this
work
was
going
forward
i
set
aside
certain
hours
of
the
day
for
the
and
certain
others
for
the
jupiter
there
were
more
men
engaged
upon
the
former
than
i
had
at
my
disposal
for
the
latter
so
the
was
by
this
time
completely
finished
the
king
had
now
returned
to
paris
and
when
i
paid
him
my
respects
i
took
the
piece
with
me
as
i
have
already
related
it
was
oval
in
form
standing
about
of
a
cubit
wrought
of
solid
gold
and
worked
entirely
with
the
chisel
while
speaking
of
the
model
i
said
before
how
i
had
represented
sea
and
earth
seated
with
their
legs
interlaced
as
we
observe
in
the
case
of
firths
and
promontories
this
attitude
was
therefore
metaphorically
appropriate
the
sea
carried
a
trident
in
his
right
hand
and
in
his
left
i
put
a
ship
of
delicate
workmanship
to
hold
the
salt
below
him
were
his
four
fashioned
like
our
horses
from
the
head
to
the
front
hoofs
all
the
rest
of
their
body
from
the
middle
backwards
resembled
a
fish
and
the
tails
of
these
creatures
were
agreeably
above
this
group
the
sea
sat
throned
in
an
attitude
of
pride
and
dignity
around
him
were
many
kinds
of
fishes
and
other
creatures
of
the
ocean
the
water
was
represented
with
its
waves
and
enamelled
in
the
appropriate
colour
i
had
portrayed
earth
under
the
form
of
a
very
handsome
woman
holding
her
horn
of
plenty
entirely
nude
like
the
male
figure
in
her
left
hand
i
placed
a
little
temple
of
ionic
architecture
most
delicately
wrought
which
was
meant
to
contain
the
pepper
beneath
her
were
the
handsomest
living
creatures
which
the
earth
produces
and
the
rocks
were
partly
enamelled
partly
left
in
gold
the
whole
piece
reposed
upon
a
base
of
ebony
properly
proportioned
but
with
a
projecting
cornice
upon
which
i
introduced
four
golden
figures
in
rather
more
than
they
represented
night
day
twilight
and
dawn
i
put
moreover
into
the
same
frieze
four
other
figures
similar
in
size
and
intended
for
the
four
chief
winds
these
were
executed
and
in
part
enamelled
with
the
most
exquisite
refinement
when
i
exhibited
this
piece
to
his
majesty
he
uttered
a
loud
outcry
of
astonishment
and
could
not
satiate
his
eyes
with
gazing
at
it
then
he
bade
me
take
it
back
to
my
house
saying
he
would
tell
me
at
the
proper
time
what
i
should
have
to
do
with
it
so
i
carried
it
home
and
sent
at
once
to
invite
several
of
my
best
friends
we
dined
gaily
together
placing
the
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
thus
we
were
the
first
to
use
it
after
this
i
went
on
working
at
my
jupiter
in
silver
and
also
at
the
great
vase
i
have
already
described
which
was
richly
decorated
with
a
variety
of
ornaments
and
figures
note
this
is
now
at
vienna
it
is
beautifully
represented
by
two
photogravures
in
great
book
on
cellini
xxxvii
at
that
time
bologna
the
painter
suggested
to
the
king
that
it
would
be
well
if
his
majesty
sent
him
to
rome
with
letters
of
recommendation
to
the
end
that
he
might
cast
the
foremost
masterpieces
of
antiquity
namely
the
laocoon
the
cleopatra
the
venus
the
commodus
the
zingara
and
the
apollo
these
of
a
truth
are
by
far
the
finest
things
in
rome
he
told
the
king
that
when
his
majesty
had
once
set
eyes
upon
those
marvellous
works
he
would
then
and
not
till
then
be
able
to
criticise
the
arts
of
design
since
everything
which
he
had
seen
by
us
moderns
was
far
removed
from
the
perfection
of
the
ancients
the
king
accepted
his
proposal
and
gave
him
the
introductions
he
required
accordingly
that
beast
went
off
and
took
his
bad
luck
with
him
not
having
the
force
and
courage
to
contend
with
his
own
hands
against
me
he
adopted
the
truly
lombard
device
of
depreciating
my
performances
by
becoming
a
copyist
of
antiques
in
its
own
proper
place
i
shall
relate
how
though
he
had
these
statues
excellently
cast
he
obtained
a
result
quite
contrary
to
his
imagination
i
had
now
done
for
ever
with
that
disreputable
caterina
and
the
unfortunate
young
man
her
husband
had
decamped
from
paris
wanting
then
to
finish
off
my
fontainebleau
which
was
already
cast
in
bronze
as
well
as
to
execute
the
two
victories
which
were
going
to
fill
the
angles
above
the
lunette
of
the
door
i
engaged
a
poor
girl
of
the
age
of
about
fifteen
she
was
beautifully
made
and
of
a
brunette
complexion
being
somewhat
savage
in
her
ways
and
spare
of
speech
quick
in
movement
with
a
look
of
sullenness
about
her
eyes
i
nicknamed
her
scorzone
her
real
name
was
jeanne
with
her
for
model
i
gave
perfect
finish
to
the
bronze
fontainebleau
and
also
to
the
two
victories
now
this
girl
was
a
clean
maid
and
i
got
her
with
child
she
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
on
the
of
june
at
thirteen
hours
of
the
day
in
when
i
had
exactly
reached
the
age
of
i
named
the
infant
costanza
and
guido
guidi
the
physician
and
my
most
intimate
friend
as
i
have
previously
related
held
her
at
the
font
he
was
the
only
godfather
for
it
is
customary
in
france
to
have
but
one
godfather
and
two
godmothers
one
of
the
latter
was
madame
maddalena
wife
to
luigi
alamanni
a
gentleman
of
florence
and
an
accomplished
poet
the
other
was
the
wife
of
ricciardo
del
bene
our
florentine
burgher
and
a
great
merchant
in
paris
she
was
herself
a
french
lady
of
distinguished
family
this
was
the
first
child
i
ever
had
so
far
as
i
remember
i
settled
money
enough
upon
the
girl
for
dowry
to
satisfy
an
aunt
of
hers
under
whose
tutelage
i
placed
her
and
from
that
time
forwards
i
had
nothing
more
to
do
with
her
note
the
cleopatra
is
that
recumbent
statue
of
a
sleeping
ariadne
or
bacchante
now
in
the
vatican
the
venus
neither
the
medicean
nor
the
capitoline
represents
the
goddess
issuing
from
the
bath
it
is
now
in
the
museo
pio
clementino
of
the
vatican
the
commodus
is
a
statue
of
hercules
with
the
skin
and
an
infant
in
his
arms
also
in
the
vatican
the
zingara
may
be
a
statue
of
diana
forming
part
of
the
borghese
collection
the
apollo
is
the
famous
belvedere
apollo
of
the
vatican
note
that
is
in
italian
rough
rind
a
name
given
to
rustics
is
also
the
name
for

venomous
serpent
xxxviii
by
labouring
incessantly
i
had
now
got
my
various
works
well
forward
the
jupiter
was
nearly
finished
and
the
vase
also
the
door
began
to
reveal
its
beauties
at
that
time
the
king
came
to
paris
and
though
i
gave
the
right
date
of
the
year
for
my
birth
we
were
still
in
but
an
opportunity
of
mentioning
my
daughter
having
arisen
i
availed
myself
of
it
so
as
not
to
interrupt
the
narrative
of
more
important
things
well
the
king
as
i
have
said
came
to
paris
and
paid
me
a
visit
soon
after
his
arrival
the
magnificent
show
of
works
brought
to
completion
was
enough
to
satisfy
eye
and
indeed
it
gave
that
glorious
monarch
no
less
contentment
than
the
artist
who
had
worked
so
hard
upon
them
desired
while
inspecting
these
things
it
came
into
his
head
that
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
had
fulfilled
none
of
his
promises
to
me
either
as
regarded
a
pension
or
anything
else
whispering
with
his
admiral
he
said
that
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
had
behaved
very
badly
in
the
matter
and
that
he
intended
to
make
it
up
to
me
himself
because
he
saw
i
was
a
man
of
few
words
who
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
might
decamp
without
complaining
or
asking
leave
on
returning
home
his
majesty
after
dinner
told
the
cardinal
to
give
orders
to
his
treasurer
of
the
exchequer
that
he
should
pay
me
at
an
early
date
seven
thousand
crowns
of
gold
in
three
or
four
instalments
according
to
his
own
convenience
provided
only
that
he
executed
the
commission
faithfully
at
the
same
time
he
repeated
words
to
this
effect
gave
benvenuto
into
your
charge
and
you
have
forgotten
all
about
the
cardinal
said
that
he
would
punctually
perform
his
commands
but
his
own
bad
nature
made
him
wait
till
the
fit
of
generosity
was
over
meanwhile
wars
and
rumours
of
wars
were
on
the
increase
it
was
the
moment
when
the
emperor
with
a
huge
army
was
marching
upon
paris
seeing
the
realm
of
france
to
be
in
great
need
of
money
the
cardinal
one
day
began
to
talk
of
me
and
said
majesty
acting
for
the
best
i
have
not
had
that
money
given
to
benvenuto
first
it
is
sorely
wanted
now
for
public
uses
secondly
so
great
a
donation
would
have
exposed
you
to
the
risk
of
losing
benvenuto
altogether
for
if
he
found
himself
a
rich
man
he
might
have
invested
his
money
in
italy
and
the
moment
some
caprice
took
of
him
he
would
have
decamped
without
hesitation
i
therefore
consider
that
your
best
course
will
be
to
present
him
with
something
in
your
kingdom
if
you
want
to
keep
him
in
your
service
for
any
length
of
the
king
being
really
in
want
of
money
approved
of
these
arguments
nevertheless
like
the
noble
soul
he
was
and
truly
worthy
of
his
royal
station
he
judged
rightly
that
the
cardinal
had
acted
thus
in
order
to
curry
favour
rather
than
from
any
clear
prevision
of
distressed
finances
in
so
vast
a
realm

the
english
were
besieging
boulogne
xxxix
as
i
have
just
said
his
majesty
affected
to
concur
with
the
cardinal
but
his
own
private
mind
was
otherwise
made
up
accordingly
upon
the
day
after
his
arrival
without
solicitation
upon
my
part
he
came
of
his
own
accord
to
my
house
i
went
to
meet
him
and
conducted
him
through
several
rooms
where
divers
works
of
art
were
on
view
beginning
with
the
less
important
i
pointed
out
a
quantity
of
things
in
bronze
and
it
was
long
since
he
had
seen
so
many
at
once
then
i
took
him
to
see
the
jupiter
in
silver
now
nearly
completed
with
all
its
splendid
decorations
it
so
happened
that
a
grievous
disappointment
which
he
had
suffered
a
few
years
earlier
made
him
think
this
piece
more
admirable
than
it
might
perhaps
have
appeared
to
any
other
man
the
occasion
to
which
i
refer
was
this
after
the
capture
of
tunis
the
emperor
passed
through
paris
with
the
consent
of
his
king
francis
who
wanted
to
present
him
with
something
worthy
of
so
great
a
potentate
having
this
in
view
he
ordered
a
hercules
to
be
executed
in
silver
exactly
of
the
same
size
as
my
jupiter
the
king
declared
this
hercules
to
be
the
ugliest
work
of
art
that
he
had
ever
seen
and
spoke
his
opinion
plainly
to
the
craftsmen
of
paris
they
vaunted
themselves
to
be
the
ablest
craftsmen
in
the
world
for
works
of
this
kind
and
informed
the
king
that
nothing
more
perfect
could
possibly
have
been
produced
in
silver
insisting
at
the
same
time
upon
being
paid
two
thousand
ducats
for
their
filthy
piece
of
work
this
made
the
king
when
he
beheld
mine
affirm
that
the
finish
of
its
workmanship
exceeded
his
highest
expectations
accordingly
he
made
an
equitable
judgment
and
had
my
statue
valued
also
at
two
thousand
ducats
saying
gave
those
other
men
no
salary
cellini
who
gets
about
a
thousand
crowns
a
year
from
me
can
surely
let
me
have
this
masterpiece
for
two
thousand
crowns
of
gold
since
he
has
his
salary
into
the
then
i
exhibited
other
things
in
gold
and
silver
and
a
variety
of
models
for
new
undertakings
at
the
last
just
when
he
was
taking
leave
i
pointed
out
upon
the
lawn
of
the
castle
that
great
giant
which
roused
him
to
higher
astonishment
than
any
of
the
other
things
he
had
inspected
turning
to
his
admiral
who
was
called
monsignor
aniballe
he
said
the
cardinal
had
made
him
no
provision
we
must
do
so
and
all
the
more
because
the
man
himself
is
so
slow
at
asking
favours
to
cut
it
short
i
mean
to
have
him
well
provided
for
yes
these
men
who
ask
for
nothing
feel
that
their
masterpieces
call
aloud
for
recompense
therefore
see
that
he
gets
the
first
abbey
that
falls
vacant
worth
two
thousand
crowns
a
year
if
this
can
not
be
had
in
one
benefice
let
him
have
two
or
three
to
that
amount
for
in
his
case
it
will
come
to
the
same
as
i
was
standing
by
i
could
hear
what
the
king
said
and
thanked
his
majesty
at
once
for
the
donation
as
though
i
were
already
in
possession
i
told
him
that
as
soon
as
his
orders
were
carried
into
effect
i
would
work
for
his
majesty
without
other
salary
or
recompense
of
any
kind
until
old
age
deprived
me
of
the
power
to
labour
when
i
hoped
to
rest
my
tired
body
in
peace
maintaining
myself
with
honour
on
that
income
and
always
bearing
in
mind
that
i
had
served
so
great
a
monarch
as
his
majesty
at
the
end
of
this
speech
the
king
turned
toward
me
with
a
lively
gesture
and
a
joyous
countenance
saying
let
it
then
be
after
that
he
departed
highly
satisfied
with
what
he
had
seen
there
note
in
the
year
charles
v
obtained
leave
to

france

his
army

in
xl
madame
when
she
heard
how
well
my
affairs
were
going
redoubled
her
spite
against
me
saying
in
her
own
heart
is
i
who
rule
the
world
and
a
little
fellow
like
that
snaps
his
fingers
at
me
she
put
every
iron
into
the
fire
which
she
could
think
of
in
order
to
stir
up
mischief
against
me
now
a
certain
man
fell
in
her
way
who
enjoyed
great
fame
as
a
distiller
he
supplied
her
with
perfumed
waters
which
were
excellent
for
the
complexion
and
hitherto
unknown
in
france
this
fellow
she
introduced
to
the
king
who
was
much
delighted
by
the
processes
for
distilling
which
he
exhibited
while
engaged
in
these
experiments
the
man
begged
his
majesty
to
give
him
a
i
had
in
my
castle
together
with
some
little
apartments
which
he
said
i
did
not
use
the
good
king
guessing
who
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
made
no
answer
but
madame
used
those
wiles
with
which
women
know
so
well
to
work
on
men
and
very
easily
succeeded
in
her
enterprise
for
having
taken
the
king
at
a
moment
of
amorous
weakness
to
which
he
was
much
subject
she
wheedled
him
into
conceding
what
she
wanted
the
distiller
came
accompanied
by
treasurer
grolier
a
very
great
nobleman
of
france
who
spoke
italian
excellently
and
when
he
entered
my
castle
began
to
jest
with
me
in
that
language
watching
his
opportunity
he
said
the
name
i
put
this
man
here
into
possession
of
that
together
with
the
lodgings
that
pertain
to
to
this
i
answered
sacred
king
is
lord
of
all
things
here
so
then
you
might
have
effected
an
entrance
with
more
freedom
coming
thus
with
notaries
and
people
of
the
court
looks
more
like
a
fraud
than
the
mandate
of
a
powerful
monarch
i
assure
you
that
before
i
carry
my
complaints
before
the
king
i
shall
defend
my
right
in
the
way
his
majesty
gave
me
orders
two
days
since
to
do
i
shall
fling
the
man
whom
you
have
put
upon
me
out
of
windows
if
i
do
not
see
a
warrant
under
the
own
hand
and
after
this
speech
the
treasurer
went
off
threatening
and
grumbling
and
i
remained
doing
the
same
without
however
beginning
the
attack
at
once
then
i
went
to
the
notaries
who
had
put
the
fellow
in
possession
i
was
well
acquainted
with
them
and
they
gave
me
to
understand
that
this
was
a
formal
proceeding
done
indeed
at
the
orders
but
which
had
not
any
great
significance
if
i
had
offered
some
trifling
opposition
the
fellow
would
not
have
installed
himself
as
he
had
done
the
formalities
were
acts
and
customs
of
the
court
which
did
not
concern
obedience
to
the
king
consequently
if
i
succeeded
in
ousting
him
i
should
have
acted
rightly
and
should
not
incur
any
risk
this
hint
was
enough
for
me
and
next
morning
i
had
recourse
to
arms
and
though
the
job
cost
me
some
trouble
i
enjoyed
it
each
day
that
followed
i
made
an
attack
with
stones
pikes
and
arquebuses
firing
however
without
ball
nevertheless
i
inspired
such
terror
that
no
one
dared
to
help
my
antagonist
accordingly
when
i
noticed
one
day
that
his
defence
was
feeble
i
entered
the
house
by
force
and
expelled
the
fellow
turning
all
his
goods
and
chattels
into
the
street
then
i
betook
me
to
the
king
and
told
him
that
i
had
done
precisely
as
his
majesty
had
ordered
by
defending
myself
against
every
one
who
sought
to
hinder
me
in
his
service
the
king
laughed
at
the
matter
and
made
me
out
new
to
secure
me
from
further
molestation

in
the
meantime
i
brought
my
silver
jupiter
to
completion
together
with
its
gilded
pedestal
which
i
placed
upon
a
wooden
plinth
that
only
showed
a
very
little
upon
the
plinth
i
introduced
four
little
round
balls
of
hard
wood
more
than
half
hidden
in
their
sockets
like
the
nut
of
a
crossbow
they
were
so
nicely
arranged
that
a
child
could
push
the
statue
forward
and
backwards
or
turn
it
round
with
ease
having
arranged
it
thus
to
my
mind
i
went
with
it
to
fountainebleau
where
the
king
was
then
residing
at
that
time
bologna
of
whom
i
have
already
said
so
much
had
brought
from
rome
his
statues
and
had
cast
them
very
carefully
in
bronze
i
knew
nothing
about
this
partly
because
he
kept
his
doings
very
dark
and
also
because
fontainebleau
is
forty
miles
distant
from
paris
on
asking
the
king
where
he
wanted
me
to
set
up
my
jupiter
madame
who
happened
to
be
present
told
him
there
was
no
place
more
appropriate
than
his
own
handsome
gallery
this
was
as
we
should
say
in
tuscany
a
loggia
or
more
exactly
a
large
lobby
it
ought
indeed
to
be
called
a
lobby
because
what
we
mean
by
loggia
is
open
at
one
side
the
hall
was
considerably
longer
than
paces
decorated
and
very
rich
with
pictures
from
the
hand
of
that
admirable
rosso
our
florentine
master
among
the
pictures
were
arranged
a
great
variety
of
sculptured
works
partly
in
the
round
and
partly
in
the
breadth
was
about
twelve
paces
now
bologna
had
brought
all
his
antiques
into
this
gallery
wrought
with
great
beauty
in
bronze
and
had
placed
them
in
a
handsome
row
upon
their
pedestals
and
they
were
as
i
have
said
the
choicest
of
the
roman
antiquities
into
this
same
gallery
i
took
my
jupiter
and
when
i
saw
that
grand
parade
so
artfully
planned
i
said
to
myself
is
like
running
the
gauntlet
now
may
god
assist
i
placed
the
statue
and
having
arranged
it
as
well
as
i
was
able
waited
for
the
coming
of
the
king
the
jupiter
was
raising
his
thunderbolt
with
the
right
hand
in
the
act
to
hurl
it
his
left
hand
held
the
globe
of
the
world
among
the
flames
of
the
thunderbolt
i
had
very
cleverly
introduced
a
torch
of
white
wax
now
madame
detained
the
king
till
nightfall
wishing
to
do
one
of
two
mischiefs
either
to
prevent
his
coming
or
else
to
spoil
the
effect
of
my
work
by
its
being
shown
off
after
dark
but
as
god
has
promised
to
those
who
trust
in
him
it
turned
out
exactly
opposite
to
her
calculations
for
when
night
came
i
set
fire
to
the
torch
which
standing
higher
than
the
head
of
jupiter
shed
light
from
above
and
showed
the
statue
far
better
than
by
daytime
at
length
the
king
arrived
he
was
attended
by
his
madame
his
son
the
dauphin
and
the
dauphinéss
together
with
the
king
of
navarre
his
madame
marguerite
his
daughter
and
several
other
great
lords
who
had
been
instructed
by
madame
to
speak
against
me
when
the
king
appeared
i
made
my
prentice
ascanio
push
the
jupiter
toward
his
majesty
as
it
moved
smoothly
forwards
my
cunning
in
its
turn
was
amply
rewarded
for
this
gentle
motion
made
the
figure
seem
alive
the
antiques
were
left
in
the
background
and
my
work
was
the
first
to
take
the
eye
with
pleasure
the
king
exclaimed
at
once
is
by
far
the
finest
thing
that
has
ever
been
seen
and
i
although
i
am
an
amateur
and
judge
of
art
could
never
have
conceived
the
hundredth
part
of
its
the
lords
whose
cue
it
was
to
speak
against
me
now
seemed
as
though
they
could
not
praise
my
masterpiece
enough
madame
said
boldly
would
think
you
had
no
eyes
you
see
all
those
fine
bronzes
from
the
antique
behind
there
in
those
consists
the
real
distinction
of
this
art
and
not
in
that
modern
then
the
king
advanced
and
the
others
with
him
after
casting
a
glance
at
the
bronzes
which
were
not
shown
to
advantage
from
the
light
being
below
them
he
exclaimed
wanted
to
injure
this
man
has
done
him
a
great
service
for
the
comparison
of
these
admirable
statues
demonstrates
the
immeasurable
superiority
of
his
work
in
beauty
and
in
art
benvenuto
deserves
to
be
made
much
of
for
his
performances
do
not
merely
rival
but
surpass
the
in
reply
to
this
madame
observed
that
my
jupiter
would
not
make
anything
like
so
fine
a
show
by
daylight
besides
one
had
to
consider
that
i
had
put
a
veil
upon
my
statue
to
conceal
its
faults
i
had
indeed
flung
a
gauze
veil
with
elegance
and
delicacy
over
a
portion
of
my
statue
with
the
view
of
augmenting
its
majesty
this
when
she
had
finished
speaking
i
lifted
from
beneath
uncovering
the
handsome
genital
members
of
the
god
then
tore
the
veil
to
pieces
with
vexation
she
imagined
i
had
disclosed
those
parts
of
the
statue
to
insult
her
the
king
noticed
how
angry
she
was
while
i
was
trying
to
force
some
words
out
in
my
fury
so
he
wisely
spoke
in
his
own
language
precisely
as
follows
i
forbid
you
to
speak
hold
your
tongue
and
you
shall
have
a
thousand
times
more
wealth
than
you
not
being
allowed
to
speak
i
writhed
my
body
in
a
rage
this
made
her
grumble
with
redoubled
spite
and
the
king
departed
sooner
than
he
would
otherwise
have
done
calling
aloud
however
to
encourage
me
have
brought
from
italy
the
greatest
man
who
ever
lived

with

i
left
the
jupiter
there
meaning
to
depart
the
next
morning
before
i
took
horse
one
thousand
crowns
were
paid
me
partly
for
my
salary
and
partly
on
account
of
monies
i
had
disbursed
having
received
this
sum
i
returned
with
a
light
heart
and
satisfied
to
paris
no
sooner
had
i
reached
home
and
dined
with
merry
cheer
than
i
called
for
all
my
wardrobe
which
included
a
great
many
suits
of
silk
choice
furs
and
also
very
fine
cloth
stuffs
from
these
i
selected
presents
for
my
workpeople
giving
each
something
according
to
his
own
desert
down
to
the
and
in
order
to
encourage
them
to
aid
me
heartily
being
then
refreshed
in
strength
and
spirits
i
attacked
the
great
statue
of
mars
which
i
had
set
up
solidly
upon
a
frame
of
woodwork
over
this
there
lay
a
crust
of
plaster
about
the
eighth
of
a
cubit
in
thickness
carefully
modelled
for
the
flesh
of
the
colossus
lastly
i
prepared
a
great
number
of
moulds
in
separate
pieces
to
compose
the
figure
intending
to
dovetail
them
together
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
art
and
this
task
involved
no
difficulty
i
will
not
here
omit
to
relate
something
which
may
serve
to
give
a
notion
of
the
size
of
this
great
work
and
is
at
the
same
time
highly
comic
it
must
first
be
mentioned
that
i
had
forbidden
all
the
men
who
lived
at
my
cost
to
bring
light
women
into
my
house
or
anywhere
within
the
castle
precincts
upon
this
point
of
discipline
i
was
extremely
strict
now
may
lad
ascanio
loved
a
very
handsome
girl
who
returned
his
passion
one
day
she
gave
her
mother
the
slip
and
came
to
see
ascanio
at
night
finding
that
she
would
not
take
her
leave
and
being
driven
to
his
ends
to
conceal
her
like
a
person
of
resources
he
hit
at
last
upon
the
plan
of
installing
her
inside
the
statue
there
in
the
head
itself
he
made
her
up
a
place
to
sleep
in
this
lodging
she
occupied
some
time
and
he
used
to
bring
her
forth
at
whiles
with
secrecy
at
night
i
meanwhile
having
brought
this
part
of
the
colossus
almost
to
completion
left
it
alone
and
indulged
my
vanity
a
bit
by
exposing
it
to
sight
it
could
indeed
be
seen
by
more
than
half
paris
the
neighbours
therefore
took
to
climbing
their
and
crowds
came
on
purpose
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
now
there
was
a
legend
in
the
city
that
my
castle
had
from
olden
times
been
haunted
by
a
spirit
though
i
never
noticed
anything
to
confirm
this
belief
and
folk
in
paris
called
it
popularly
by
the
name
of
lemmonio
boreň
the
girl
while
she
sojourned
in
the
head
could
not
prevent
some
of
her
movements
to
and
fro
from
being
perceptible
through
its
this
made
stupid
people
say
that
the
ghost
had
got
into
the
body
of
the
figure
and
was
setting
its
eyes
in
motion
and
its
mouth
as
though
it
were
about
to
talk
many
of
them
went
away
in
terror
others
more
incredulous
came
to
observe
the
phenomenon
and
when
they
were
unable
to
deny
the
flashing
of
the
eyes
they
too
declared
their
credence
in
a
spirit
not
guessing
that
there
was
a
spirit
there
and
sound
young
flesh
to
boot
note
this
was
what
he
called
the
colossus
above
he
meant
it
for
the
fountain
of
fontainebleau

bourru
the
ghost
of
a
monk
dressed
in
drugget

petit
nesle
had
a
bad
reputation
on
account
of
the
murders
said
to
have
been
committed
there
in
the
fourteenth
century
by
queen
jeanne
wife
of
philip
xliii
all
this
while
i
was
engaged
in
putting
my
door
together
with
its
several
appurtenances
as
it
is
no
part
of
my
purpose
to
include
in
this
autobiography
such
things
as
annalists
record
i
have
omitted
the
coming
of
the
emperor
with
his
great
host
and
the
mustering
of
his
whole
army
at
the
time
when
these
events
took
place
his
majesty
sought
my
advice
with
regard
to
the
instantaneous
fortification
of
paris
he
came
on
purpose
to
my
house
and
took
me
all
round
the
city
and
when
he
found
that
i
was
prepared
to
fortify
the
town
with
expedition
on
a
sound
plan
he
gave
express
orders
that
all
my
suggestions
should
be
carried
out
his
admiral
was
directed
to
command
the
citizens
to
obey
me
under
pain
of
his
displeasure
now
the
admiral
had
been
appointed
through
madame
influence
rather
than
from
any
proof
of
his
ability
for
he
was
a
man
of
little
talent
he
bore
the
name
of
which
in
our
tongue
is
monsignor
but
the
french
pronounce
it
so
that
they
usually
made
it
sound
like
monsignore
asino
bue
this
animal
then
referred
to
madame
for
advice
upon
the
matter
and
she
ordered
him
to
summon
girolamo
bellarmato
without
loss
of
time
he
was
an
engineer
from
siena
at
that
time
in
dieppe
which
is
rather
more
than
a
journey
distant
from
the
capital
he
came
at
once
and
set
the
work
of
fortification
going
on
a
very
tedious
method
which
made
me
throw
the
job
up
if
the
emperor
had
pushed
forward
at
this
time
he
might
easily
have
taken
paris
people
indeed
said
that
when
a
treaty
of
peace
was
afterwards
concluded
madame
who
took
more
part
in
it
than
anybody
else
betrayed
the
king
i
shall
pass
this
matter
over
without
further
words
since
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
plan
of
my
meanwhile
i
worked
diligently
at
the
door
and
finished
the
vase
together
with
two
others
of
middling
size
which
i
made
of
my
own
silver
at
the
end
of
those
great
troubles
the
king
came
to
take
his
ease
awhile
in
paris
that
accursed
woman
seemed
born
to
be
the
ruin
of
the
world
i
ought
therefore
to
think
myself
of
some
account
seeing
she
held
me
for
her
mortal
enemy
happening
to
speak
one
day
with
the
good
king
about
my
matters
she
abused
me
to
such
an
extent
that
he
swore
in
order
to
appease
her
he
would
take
no
more
heed
of
me
thenceforward
than
if
he
had
never
set
eyes
upon
my
face
these
words
were
immediately
brought
me
by
a
page
of
cardinal
ferrara
called
il
villa
who
said
he
had
heard
the
king
utter
them
i
was
infuriated
to
such
a
pitch
that
i
dashed
my
tools
across
the
room
and
all
the
things
i
was
at
work
on
made
my
arrangements
to
quit
france
and
went
upon
the
spot
to
find
the
king
when
he
had
dined
i
was
shown
into
a
room
where
i
found
his
majesty
in
the
company
of
a
very
few
persons
after
i
had
paid
him
the
respects
due
to
kings
he
bowed
his
head
with
a
gracious
smile
this
revived
hope
in
me
so
i
drew
nearer
to
his
majesty
for
they
were
showing
him
some
things
in
my
own
line
of
art
and
after
we
had
talked
awhile
about
such
matters
he
asked
if
i
had
anything
worth
seeing
at
my
house
and
next
inquired
when
i
should
like
him
to
come
i
replied
that
i
had
some
pieces
ready
to
show
his
majesty
if
he
pleased
at
once
he
told
me
to
go
home
and
he
would
come
immediately
note
toward
the
end
of
august
the
imperial
army
advanced
as
far
as
epernay
within
twenty
leagues
of
paris

note
girolamo
bellarmati
a
learned
mathematicians
and
military
architect
banished
from
siena
for
political
reasons
he
designed
the
harbour
of
havre
note
there
is
indeed
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
mistress
in
her
jealousy
of
the
dauphin
and
diane
de
poitiers
played
false
and
enabled
the
imperialists
to
advance
beyond
epernay
xliv
i
went
accordingly
and
waited
for
the
good
visit
who
it
seems
had
gone
meanwhile
to
take
leave
of
madame
she
asked
whither
he
was
bound
adding
that
she
would
accompany
him
but
when
he
informed
her
she
told
him
that
she
would
not
go
and
begged
him
as
a
special
favour
not
to
go
himself
that
day
she
had
to
return
to
the
charge
more
than
twice
before
she
shook
the
determination
however
he
did
not
come
to
visit
me
that
day
next
morning
i
went
to
his
majesty
at
the
same
hour
and
no
sooner
had
he
caught
sight
of
me
than
he
swore
it
was
his
intention
to
come
to
me
upon
the
spot
going
then
according
to
his
wont
to
take
leave
of
his
dear
madame
this
lady
saw
that
all
her
influence
had
not
been
able
to
divert
him
from
his
purpose
so
she
began
with
that
biting
tongue
of
hers
to
say
the
worst
of
me
that
could
be
insinuated
against
a
deadly
enemy
of
this
most
worthy
crown
of
france
the
good
king
appeased
her
by
replying
that
the
sole
object
of
his
visit
was
to
administer
such
a
scolding
as
should
make
me
tremble
in
my
shoes
this
he
swore
to
do
upon
his
honour
then
he
came
to
my
house
and
i
conducted
him
through
certain
rooms
upon
the
basement
where
i
had
put
the
whole
of
my
great
door
together
upon
beholding
it
the
king
was
struck
with
stupefaction
and
quite
lost
his
cue
for
reprimanding
me
as
he
had
promised
madame
still
he
did
not
choose
to
go
away
without
finding
some
opportunity
for
scolding
so
he
began
in
this
wise
is
one
most
important
matter
benvenuto
which
men
of
your
sort
though
full
of
talent
ought
always
to
bear
in
mind
it
is
that
you
can
not
bring
your
great
gifts
to
light
by
your
own
strength
alone
you
show
your
greatness
only
through
the
opportunities
we
give
you
now
you
ought
to
be
a
little
more
submissive
not
so
arrogant
and
headstrong
i
remember
that
i
gave
you
express
orders
to
make
me
twelve
silver
statues
and
this
was
all
i
wanted
you
have
chosen
to
execute
a
and
vases
and
busts
and
doors
and
a
heap
of
other
things
which
quite
confound
me
when
i
consider
how
you
have
neglected
my
wishes
and
worked
for
the
fulfillment
of
your
own
if
you
mean
to
go
on
in
this
way
i
shall
presently
let
you
understand
what
is
my
own
method
of
procedure
when
i
choose
to
have
things
done
in
my
own
way
i
tell
you
therefore
plainly
do
your
utmost
to
obey
my
commands
for
if
you
stick
to
your
own
fancies
you
will
run
your
head
against
a
while
he
was
uttering
these
words
his
lords
in
waiting
hung
upon
the
lips
seeing
him
shake
his
head
frown
and
gesticulate
now
with
one
hand
and
now
with
the
other
the
whole
company
of
attendants
therefore
quaked
with
fear
for
me
but
i
stood
firm
and
let
no
breath
of
fear
pass
over
me
xlv
when
he
had
wound
up
this
sermon
agreed
upon
beforehand
with
his
darling
madame
i
bent
one
leg
upon
the
ground
and
kissed
his
coat
above
the
knee
then
i
began
my
speech
as
follows
majesty
i
admit
that
all
that
you
have
said
is
true
only
in
reply
i
protest
that
my
heart
has
ever
been
by
day
and
night
with
all
my
vital
forces
bent
on
serving
you
and
executing
your
commands
if
it
appears
to
your
majesty
that
my
actions
contradict
these
words
let
your
majesty
be
sure
that
benvenuto
was
not
at
fault
but
rather
possibly
my
evil
fate
or
adverse
fortune
which
has
made
me
unworthy
to
serve
the
most
admirable
prince
who
ever
blessed
this
earth
therefore
i
crave
your
pardon
i
was
under
the
impression
however
that
your
majesty
had
given
me
silver
for
one
statue
only
having
no
more
at
my
disposal
i
could
not
execute
others
so
with
the
surplus
which
remained
for
use
i
made
this
vase
to
show
your
majesty
the
grand
style
of
the
ancients
perhaps
you
never
had
seen
anything
of
the
sort
before
as
for
the
i
thought
if
my
memory
does
not
betray
me
that
your
majesty
on
one
occasion
ordered
me
to
make
it
of
your
own
accord
the
conversation
falling
upon
something
of
the
kind
which
had
been
brought
for
your
inspection
i
showed
you
a
model
made
by
me
in
italy
you
following
the
impulse
of
your
own
mind
only
had
a
thousand
golden
ducats
told
out
for
me
to
execute
the
piece
withal
thanking
me
in
addition
for
my
hint
and
what
is
more
i
seem
to
remember
that
you
commended
me
highly
when
it
was
completed
as
regards
the
door
it
was
my
impression
that
after
we
had
chanced
to
speak
about
it
at
some
time
or
other
your
majesty
gave
orders
to
your
chief
secretary
villerois
from
whom
the
order
passed
to
de
marmagne
and
de
la
fa
to
this
effect
that
all
these
gentlemen
should
keep
me
going
at
the
work
and
see
that
i
obtained
the
necessary
funds
without
such
commission
i
should
certainly
not
have
been
able
to
advance
so
great
an
undertaking
on
my
own
resources
as
for
the
bronze
heads
the
pedestal
of
jupiter
and
other
things
i
will
begin
by
saying
that
i
cast
those
heads
upon
my
own
account
in
order
to
become
acquainted
with
french
clays
of
which
as
a
foreigner
i
had
no
previous
knowledge
whatsoever
unless
i
had
made
the
experiment
i
could
not
have
set
about
casting
those
large
works
now
touching
the
pedestals
i
have
to
say
that
i
made
them
because
i
judged
them
necessary
to
the
statues
consequently
in
all
that
i
have
done
i
meant
to
act
for
the
best
and
at
no
point
to
swerve
from
your
expressed
wishes
it
is
indeed
true
that
i
set
that
huge
colossus
up
to
satisfy
my
own
desire
paying
for
it
from
my
own
purse
even
to
the
point
which
it
has
reached
because
i
thought
that
you
being
the
great
king
you
are
and
i
the
trifling
artist
that
i
am
it
was
my
duty
to
erect
for
your
glory
and
my
own
a
statue
the
like
of
which
the
ancients
never
saw
now
at
the
last
having
been
taught
that
god
is
not
inclined
to
make
me
worthy
of
so
glorious
a
service
i
beseech
your
majesty
instead
of
the
noble
recompense
you
had
in
mind
to
give
me
for
my
labours
bestow
upon
me
only
one
small
trifle
of
your
favour
and
therewith
the
leave
to
quit
your
kingdom
at
this
instant
if
you
condescend
to
my
request
i
shall
return
to
italy
always
thanking
god
and
your
majesty
for
the
happy
hours
which
i
have
passed
in
serving
xlvi
the
king
stretched
forth
his
own
hands
and
raised
me
very
graciously
then
he
told
me
that
i
ought
to
continue
in
his
service
and
that
all
that
i
had
done
was
right
and
pleasing
to
him
turning
to
the
lords
in
his
company
he
spoke
these
words
precisely
verily
believe
that
a
finer
door
could
not
be
made
for
paradise
when
he
had
ceased
speaking
although
his
speech
had
been
entirely
in
my
favour
i
again
thanked
him
respectfully
repeating
however
my
request
for
leave
to
travel
for
the
heat
of
my
indignation
had
not
yet
cooled
down
his
majesty
feeling
that
i
set
too
little
store
upon
his
unwonted
and
extraordinary
condescension
commanded
me
with
a
great
and
terrible
voice
to
hold
my
tongue
unless
i
wanted
to
incur
his
wrath
afterwards
he
added
that
he
would
drown
me
in
gold
and
that
he
gave
me
the
leave
i
asked
and
over
and
above
the
works
he
had
commissioned
he
was
very
well
satisfied
with
what
i
had
done
on
my
account
in
the
interval
i
should
never
henceforth
have
any
quarrels
with
him
because
he
knew
my
character
and
for
my
part
i
too
ought
to
study
the
temper
of
his
majesty
as
my
duty
required
i
answered
that
i
thanked
god
and
his
majesty
for
everything
then
i
asked
him
to
come
and
see
how
far
i
had
advanced
the
great
colossus
so
he
came
to
my
house
and
i
had
the
statue
uncovered
he
admired
it
extremely
and
gave
orders
to
his
secretary
to
pay
me
all
the
money
i
had
spent
upon
it
be
the
sum
what
it
might
provided
i
wrote
the
bill
out
in
my
own
hand
then
he
departed
saying
mon
ami
which
is
a
phrase
not
often
used
by
kings
note
the
mss
in
this
phrase
vary
and
the
meaning
is
not
quite
clear
according
to
one
reading
the
sense
would
be
the
works
he
had
commissioned
were
not
yet
but
this
involves
an
awkward
use
of
the
word
xlvii
after
returning
to
his
palace
he
called
to
mind
the
words
i
had
spoken
in
our
previous
interview
some
of
which
were
so
excessively
humble
and
others
so
proud
and
haughty
that
they
caused
him
no
small
irritation
he
repeated
a
few
of
them
in
the
presence
of
madame
and
monsignor
di
san
polo
a
great
baron
of
france
this
man
had
always
professed
much
friendship
for
me
in
the
past
and
certainly
on
that
occasion
he
showed
his
after
the
french
fashion
with
great
cleverness
it
happened
thus
the
king
in
the
course
of
a
long
conversation
complained
that
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
to
whose
care
he
had
entrusted
me
never
gave
a
thought
to
my
affairs
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
i
might
have
decamped
from
the
realm
therefore
he
must
certainly
arrange
for
committing
me
to
some
one
who
would
appreciate
me
better
because
he
did
not
want
to
run
a
farther
risk
of
losing
me
at
these
words
monsieur
de
saint
paul
expressed
his
willingness
to
undertake
the
charge
saying
that
if
the
king
appointed
him
my
guardian
he
would
act
so
that
i
should
never
have
the
chance
to
leave
the
kingdom
the
king
replied
that
he
was
very
well
satisfied
if
only
saint
paul
would
explain
the
way
in
which
he
meant
to
manage
me
madame
sat
by
with
an
air
of
sullen
irritation
and
saint
paul
stood
on
his
dignity
declining
to
answer
the
question
when
the
king
repeated
it
he
said
to
curry
favour
with
madame
would
hang
that
benvenuto
of
yours
by
the
neck
and
thus
you
would
keep
him
for
ever
in
your
she
broke
into
a
fit
of
laughter
protesting
that
i
richly
deserved
it
the
king
to
keep
them
company
began
to
laugh
and
said
he
had
no
objection
to
saint
paul
hanging
me
if
he
could
first
produce
my
equal
in
the
arts
and
although
i
had
not
earned
such
a
fate
he
gave
him
full
liberty
and
license
in
this
way
that
day
ended
and
i
came
off
safe
and
sound
for
which
may
god
be
praised
and
thanked

one
of

and

of
françois
xlviii
the
king
had
now
made
peace
with
the
emperor
but
not
with
the
english
and
these
devils
were
keeping
us
in
constant
agitation
his
majesty
had
therefore
other
things
than
pleasure
to
attend
to
he
ordered
piero
strozzi
to
go
with
ships
of
war
into
the
english
waters
but
this
was
a
very
difficult
undertaking
even
for
that
great
commander
without
a
paragon
in
his
times
in
the
art
of
war
and
also
without
a
paragon
in
his
misfortunes
several
months
passed
without
my
receiving
money
or
commissions
accordingly
i
dismissed
my
work
people
with
the
exception
of
the
two
italians
whom
i
set
to
making
two
big
vases
out
of
my
own
silver
for
these
men
could
not
work
in
bronze
after
they
had
finished
these
i
took
them
to
a
city
which
belonged
to
the
queen
of
navarre
it
is
called
argentana
and
is
distant
several
journey
from
paris
on
arriving
at
this
place
i
found
that
the
king
was
indisposed
and
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
told
his
majesty
that
i
was
come
he
made
no
answer
which
obliged
me
to
stay
several
days
kicking
my
heels
of
a
truth
i
never
was
more
uncomfortable
in
my
life
but
at
last
i
presented
myself
one
evening
and
offered
the
two
vases
for
the
inspection
he
was
excessively
delighted
and
when
i
saw
him
in
good
homier
i
begged
his
majesty
to
grant
me
the
favour
of
permitting
me
to
travel
into
italy
i
would
leave
the
seven
months
of
my
salary
which
were
due
and
his
majesty
might
condescend
to
pay
me
when
i
required
money
for
my
return
journey
i
entreated
him
to
grant
this
petition
seeing
that
the
times
were
more
for
fighting
than
for
making
statues
moreover
his
majesty
had
allowed
a
similar
license
to
bologna
the
painter
wherefore
i
humbly
begged
him
to
concede
the
same
to
me
while
i
was
uttering
these
words
the
king
kept
gazing
intently
on
the
vases
and
from
time
to
time
shot
a
terrible
glance
at
me
nevertheless
i
went
on
praying
to
the
best
of
my
ability
that
he
would
favour
my
petition
all
of
a
sudden
he
rose
angrily
from
his
seat
and
said
to
me
in
italian
you
are
a
great
fool
take
these
vases
back
to
paris
for
i
want
to
have
them
without
making
any
other
answer
he
then
departed
i
went
up
to
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
who
was
present
and
besought
him
since
he
had
already
conferred
upon
me
the
great
benefit
of
freeing
me
from
prison
in
rome
with
many
others
besides
to
do
me
this
one
favour
more
of
procuring
for
me
leave
to
travel
into
italy
he
answered
that
he
should
be
very
glad
to
do
his
best
to
gratify
me
in
this
matter
i
might
leave
it
without
farther
thought
to
him
and
even
if
i
chose
might
set
off
at
once
because
he
would
act
for
the
best
in
my
interest
with
the
king
i
told
the
cardinal
that
since
i
was
aware
his
majesty
had
put
me
under
the
protection
of
his
most
reverend
lordship
if
he
gave
me
leave
i
felt
ready
to
depart
and
promised
to
return
upon
the
smallest
hint
from
his
reverence
the
cardinal
then
bade
me
go
back
to
paris
and
wait
there
eight
days
during
which
time
he
would
procure
the
license
for
me
if
his
majesty
refused
to
let
me
go
he
would
without
fail
inform
me
but
if
i
received
no
letters
that
would
be
a
sign
that
i
might
set
off
with
an
easy
mind
note
the
peace
of
crépy
was
concluded
september
the
english
had
taken
boulogne

days
earlier

it
will
be
remembered
had

married
to
the
duc
and
after
his
death
retained
his
fiefs
xlix
i
obeyed
the
cardinal
and
returned
to
paris
where
i
made
excellent
cases
for
my
three
silver
vases
after
the
lapse
of
twenty
days
i
began
my
preparations
and
packed
the
three
vases
upon
a
mule
this
animal
had
been
lent
me
for
the
journey
to
lyons
by
the
bishop
of
pavia
who
was
now
once
more
installed
in
my
castle
then
i
departed
in
my
evil
hour
together
with
signor
ippolito
gonzaga
at
that
time
in
the
pay
of
the
king
and
also
in
the
service
of
count
galeotto
della
mirandola
some
other
gentlemen
of
the
said
count
went
with
us
as
well
as
lionardo
tedaldi
our
of
florence
i
made
ascanio
and
pagolo
guardians
of
my
castle
and
all
my
property
including
two
little
vases
which
were
only
just
begun
those
i
left
behind
in
order
that
the
two
young
men
might
not
be
idle
i
had
lived
very
handsomely
in
paris
and
therefore
there
was
a
large
amount
of
costly
household
furniture
the
whole
value
of
these
effects
exceeded
crowns
i
bade
ascanio
remember
what
great
benefits
i
had
bestowed
upon
him
and
that
up
to
the
present
he
had
been
a
mere
thoughtless
lad
the
time
was
now
come
for
him
to
show
the
prudence
of
a
man
therefore
i
thought
fit
to
leave
him
in
the
custody
of
all
my
goods
as
also
of
my
honour
if
he
had
the
least
thing
to
complain
of
from
those
brutes
of
frenchmen
he
was
to
let
me
hear
at
once
because
i
would
take
post
and
fly
from
any
place
in
which
i
found
myself
not
only
to
discharge
the
great
obligations
under
which
i
lay
to
that
good
king
but
also
to
defend
my
honour
ascanio
replied
with
the
tears
of
a
thief
and
hypocrite
have
never
known
a
father
better
than
you
are
and
all
things
which
a
good
son
is
bound
to
perform
for
a
good
father
will
i
ever
do
for
so
then
i
took
my
departure
attended
by
a
servant
and
a
little
french
lad
it
was
just
past
noon
when
some
of
the
treasurers
by
no
means
friends
of
mine
made
a
visit
to
my
castle
the
rascally
fellows
began
by
saying
that
i
had
gone
off
with
the
silver
and
told
messer
guido
and
the
bishop
of
pavia
to
send
at
once
off
after
his
vases
if
not
they
would
themselves
despatch
a
messenger
to
get
them
back
and
do
me
some
great
mischief
the
bishop
and
messer
guido
were
much
more
frightened
than
was
necessary
so
they
sent
that
traitor
ascanio
by
the
post
off
on
the
spot
he
made
his
appearance
before
me
about
midnight
i
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
and
kept
revolving
sad
thoughts
to
the
following
effect
whose
hands
have
i
left
my
property
my
castle
oh
what
a
fate
is
this
of
mine
which
forces
me
to
take
this
journey
may
god
grant
only
that
the
cardinal
is
not
of
one
mind
with
madame
who
has
nothing
else
so
much
at
heart
as
to
make
me
lose
the
grace
of
that
good
l
while
i
was
thus
dismally
debating
with
myself
i
heard
ascanio
calling
me
on
the
instant
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
asked
if
he
brought
good
or
evil
tidings
the
knave
answered
are
good
news
i
bring
but
you
must
only
send
back
those
three
vases
for
the
rascally
treasurers
keep
shouting
thief
so
the
bishop
and
messer
guido
say
that
you
must
absolutely
send
them
back
for
the
rest
you
need
have
no
anxiety
but
may
pursue
your
journey
with
a
light
i
handed
over
the
vases
immediately
two
of
them
being
my
own
property
together
with
the
silver
and
much
else
besides
i
had
meant
to
take
them
to
the
cardinal
of
abbey
at
lyons
for
though
people
accused
me
of
wanting
to
carry
them
into
italy
everybody
knows
quite
well
that
it
is
impossible
to
export
money
gold
or
silver
from
france
without
special
license
consider
therefore
whether
i
could
have
crossed
the
frontier
with
those
three
great
vases
which
together
with
their
cases
were
a
whole
burden
it
is
certainly
true
that
since
these
articles
were
of
great
value
and
the
highest
beauty
i
felt
uneasiness
in
case
the
king
should
die
and
i
had
lately
left
him
in
a
very
bad
state
of
health
therefore
i
said
to
myself
such
an
accident
should
happen
having
these
things
in
the
keeping
of
the
cardinal
i
shall
not
lose
well
to
cut
the
story
short
i
sent
back
the
mule
with
the
vases
and
other
things
of
importance
then
upon
the
following
morning
i
travelled
forward
with
the
company
i
have
already
mentioned
nor
could
i
through
the
whole
journey
refrain
from
sighing
and
weeping
sometimes
however
i
consoled
myself
with
god
by
saying
god
before
whose
eyes
the
truth
lies
open
thou
knowest
that
my
object
in
this
journey
is
only
to
carry
alms
to
six
poor
miserable
virgins
and
their
mother
my
own
sister
they
have
indeed
their
father
but
he
is
very
old
and
gains
nothing
by
his
trade
i
fear
therefore
lest
they
might
too
easily
take
to
a
bad
course
of
life
since
then
i
am
performing
a
true
act
of
piety
i
look
to
thy
majesty
for
aid
and
this
was
all
the
recreation
i
enjoyed
upon
my
forward
journey
we
were
one
day
distant
from
lyons
and
it
was
close
upon
the
hour
of
when
the
heavens
began
to
thunder
with
sharp
rattling
claps
although
the
sky
was
quite
clear
at
the
time
i
was
riding
a
shot
before
my
comrades
after
the
thunder
the
heavens
made
a
noise
so
great
and
horrible
that
i
thought
the
last
day
had
come
so
i
reined
in
for
a
moment
while
a
shower
of
hail
began
to
fall
without
a
drop
of
water
a
first
hail
was
somewhat
larger
than
pellets
from
a
popgun
and
when
these
struck
me
they
hurt
considerably
little
by
little
it
increased
in
size
until
the
stones
might
be
compared
to
balls
from
a
crossbow
my
horse
became
restive
with
fright
so
i
wheeled
round
and
returned
at
a
gallop
to
where
i
found
my
comrades
taking
refuge
in
a
the
hail
now
grew
to
the
size
of
big
lemons
i
began
to
sing
a
miserere
and
while
i
was
devoutly
uttering
this
psalm
to
god
there
fell
a
stone
so
huge
that
it
smashed
the
thick
branches
of
the
pine
under
which
i
had
retired
for
safety
another
of
the
hailstones
hit
my
horse
upon
the
head
and
almost
stunned
him
one
struck
me
also
but
not
directly
else
it
would
have
killed
me
in
like
manner
poor
old
lionardo
tedaldi
who
like
me
was
kneeling
on
the
ground
received
so
shrewd
a
blow
that
he
fell
grovelling
upon
all
fours
when
i
saw
that
the
fir
bough
offered
no
protection
and
that
i
ought
to
act
as
well
as
to
intone
my
misereres
i
began
at
once
to
wrap
my
mantle
round
my
head
at
the
same
time
i
cried
to
lionardo
who
was
shrieking
for
succour
jesus
that
jesus
would
help
him
if
he
helped
himself
i
had
more
trouble
in
looking
after
this
safety
than
my
own
the
storm
raged
for
some
while
but
at
last
it
stopped
and
we
who
were
pounded
black
and
blue
scrambled
as
well
as
we
could
upon
our
horses
pursuing
the
way
to
our
lodging
for
the
night
we
showed
our
scratches
and
bruises
to
each
other
but
about
a
mile
farther
on
we
came
upon
a
scene
of
devastation
which
surpassed
what
we
had
suffered
and
defies
description
all
the
trees
were
stripped
of
their
leaves
and
shattered
the
beasts
in
the
field
lay
dead
many
of
the
herdsmen
had
also
been
killed
we
observed
large
quantities
of
hailstones
which
could
not
have
been
grasped
with
two
hands
feeling
then
that
we
had
come
well
out
of
a
great
peril
we
acknowledged
that
our
prayers
to
god
and
misereres
had
helped
us
more
than
we
could
have
helped
ourselves
returning
thanks
to
god
therefore
we
entered
lyons
in
the
course
of
the
next
day
and
tarried
there
eight
days
at
the
end
of
this
time
being
refreshed
in
strength
and
spirits
we
resumed
our
journey
and
passed
the
mountains
without
mishap
on
the
other
side
i
bought
a
little
pony
because
the
baggage
which
i
carried
had
somewhat
overtired
my
horses
note
e
ogni
cosal
these
words
refer
perhaps
to
the
vases
silver
and
everything
pertaining
to
them
note
era
bianchissima
perhaps
this
ought
to
be
the
air
blazed
with
lightnings
goethe
takes
it
as
i
do
above
li
after
we
had
been
one
day
in
italy
the
count
galeotto
della
mirandola
joined
us
he
was
travelling
by
post
and
stopping
where
we
were
he
told
me
that
i
had
done
wrong
to
leave
france
i
ought
not
to
journey
forwards
for
if
i
returned
at
once
my
affairs
would
be
more
prosperous
than
ever
on
the
other
hand
if
i
persisted
in
my
course
i
was
giving
the
game
up
to
my
enemies
and
furnishing
them
with
opportunities
to
do
me
mischief
by
returning
i
might
put
a
stop
to
their
intrigues
and
those
in
whom
i
placed
the
most
confidence
were
just
the
men
who
played
most
traitorously
he
would
not
say
more
than
that
he
knew
very
well
all
about
it
and
indeed
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
had
now
conspired
with
the
two
rogues
i
left
in
charge
of
all
my
business
having
repeated
over
and
over
again
that
i
ought
absolutely
to
turn
back
he
went
onward
with
the
post
while
i
being
influenced
by
my
companions
could
not
make
my
mind
up
to
return
my
heart
was
sorely
torn
asunder
at
one
moment
by
the
desire
to
reach
florence
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
at
another
by
the
conviction
that
i
ought
to
regain
france
at
last
in
order
to
end
the
fever
of
this
irresolution
i
determined
to
take
the
post
for
florence
i
could
not
make
arrangements
with
the
first
postmaster
but
persisted
in
my
purpose
to
press
forward
and
endure
an
anxious
life
at
florence
i
parted
company
with
signor
ippolito
gonzaga
who
took
the
route
for
mirandola
while
i
diverged
upon
the
road
to
parma
and
piacenza
in
the
latter
city
i
met
duke
pier
luigi
upon
the
street
who
stared
me
in
the
face
and
recognised
me
since
i
knew
him
to
have
been
the
sole
cause
of
my
imprisonment
in
the
castle
of
angelo
the
sight
of
him
made
my
blood
boil
yet
being
unable
to
escape
from
the
man
i
decided
to
pay
him
my
respects
and
arrived
just
after
he
had
risen
from
table
in
the
company
of
the
landi
who
afterwards
murdered
him
on
my
appearance
he
received
me
with
unbounded
marks
of
esteem
and
affection
among
which
he
took
occasion
to
remark
to
the
gentlemen
present
that
i
was
the
first
artist
of
the
world
in
my
own
line
and
that
i
had
been
for
a
long
while
in
prison
at
rome
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
benvenuto
i
was
deeply
grieved
for
your
misfortune
and
knew
well
that
you
were
innocent
but
could
not
do
anything
to
help
you
in
short
it
was
my
father
who
chose
to
gratify
some
enemies
of
yours
from
whom
moreover
he
heard
that
you
had
spoken
ill
of
him
i
am
convinced
this
was
not
true
and
indeed
i
was
heartily
sorry
for
your
these
words
he
kept
piling
up
and
repeating
until
he
seemed
to
be
begging
my
pardon
afterwards
he
inquired
about
the
work
i
had
been
doing
for
his
most
christian
majesty
and
on
my
furnishing
him
with
details
he
listened
as
attentively
and
graciously
as
possible
then
he
asked
if
i
had
a
mind
to
serve
him
to
this
i
replied
that
my
honour
would
not
allow
me
to
do
so
but
that
if
i
had
completed
those
extensive
works
begun
for
the
king
i
should
be
disposed
to
quit
any
great
prince
merely
to
enter
his
service
hereby
it
may
be
seen
how
the
power
and
goodness
of
god
never
leave
unpunished
any
sort
or
quality
of
men
who
act
unjustly
toward
the
innocent
this
man
did
what
was
equivalent
to
begging
my
pardon
in
the
presence
of
those
very
persons
who
subsequently
took
revenge
on
him
for
me
and
many
others
whom
he
had
massacred
let
then
no
prince
however
great
he
be
laugh
at
justice
in
the
way
that
many
whom
i
know
are
doing
and
who
have
cruelly
maltreated
me
as
i
shall
relate
at
the
proper
time
i
do
not
write
these
things
in
any
worldly
spirit
of
boasting
but
only
to
return
thanks
to
god
my
deliverer
in
so
many
trials
in
those
too
which
daily
assail
me
i
always
carry
my
complaint
to
him
and
call
on
him
to
be
my
defender
on
all
occasions
after
i
have
done
my
best
to
aid
myself
if
i
lose
courage
and
my
feeble
forces
fail
then
is
the
great
might
of
god
manifested
which
descends
unexpectedly
on
those
who
wrongfully
injure
their
neighbours
or
neglect
the
grave
and
honourable
charge
they
have
received
from
him
note
the
text
here
is
obscure
the
words
a

might
mean
get
by
any
means
however
inconvenient
to
i
have
chosen
another
interpretation
in
the

more

had
its

political
errors
no
less
than
in
his
intolerable
misgovernment
and
infamous
private
life
lii
when
i
returned
to
my
inn
i
found
that
the
duke
had
sent
me
abundance
to
eat
and
drink
of
very
excellent
quality
i
made
a
hearty
meal
then
mounted
and
rode
toward
florence
there
i
found
my
sister
with
six
daughters
the
eldest
of
whom
was
marriageable
and
the
youngest
still
at
nurse
her
husband
by
reason
of
divers
circumstances
in
the
city
had
lost
employment
from
his
trade
i
had
sent
gems
and
french
jewellery
more
than
a
year
earlier
to
the
amount
of
about
two
thousand
ducats
and
now
brought
with
me
the
same
wares
to
the
value
of
about
one
thousand
crowns
i
discovered
that
whereas
i
made
them
an
allowance
of
four
golden
crowns
a
month
they
always
drew
considerable
sums
from
the
current
sale
of
these
articles
my
was
such
an
honest
fellow
that
fearing
to
give
me
cause
for
anger
he
had
pawned
nearly
everything
he
possessed
and
was
devoured
by
interest
in
his
anxiety
to
leave
my
monies
untouched
it
seems
that
my
allowance
made
by
way
of
charity
did
not
suffice
for
the
needs
of
the
family
when
then
i
found
him
so
honest
in
his
dealings
i
felt
inclined
to
raise
his
pension
and
it
was
my
intention
before
leaving
florence
to
make
some
arrangement
for
all
of
his
daughters
note
though
this
paragraph
is
confused
the
meaning
seems
to
be
that
did
not
use
the
money
which
accrued
from
the
sale
of
jewellery
and
got
into
debt
because
his
allowance
was
inadequate
and
he
was
out
of
work
liii
the
duke
of
florence
at
this
time
which
was
the
month
of
august
had
retired
to
poggio
a
cajano
ten
miles
distant
from
florence
thither
then
i
went
to
pay
him
my
respects
with
the
sole
object
of
acting
as
duty
required
first
because
i
was
a
florentine
and
next
because
my
forefathers
had
always
been
adherents
of
the
medicean
party
and
i
yielded
to
none
of
them
in
affection
for
this
duke
cosimo
as
i
have
said
then
i
rode
to
poggio
with
the
sole
object
of
paying
my
respects
and
with
no
intention
of
accepting
service
under
him
as
god
who
does
all
things
well
did
then
appoint
for
me
when
i
was
introduced
the
duke
received
me
very
kindly
then
he
and
the
duchess
put
questions
concerning
the
works
which
i
had
executed
for
the
king
i
answered
willingly
and
in
detail
after
listening
to
my
story
he
answered
that
he
had
heard
as
much
and
that
i
spoke
the
truth
then
he
assumed
a
tone
of
sympathy
and
added
small
a
recompense
for
such
great
and
noble
masterpieces
friend
benvenuto
if
you
feel
inclined
to
execute
something
for
me
too
i
am
ready
to
pay
you
far
better
than
that
king
of
yours
had
done
for
whom
your
excellent
nature
prompts
you
to
speak
so
when
i
understood
his
drift
i
described
the
deep
obligations
under
which
i
lay
to
his
majesty
who
first
obtained
my
liberation
from
that
iniquitous
prison
and
afterwards
supplied
me
with
the
means
of
carrying
out
more
admirable
works
than
any
artist
of
my
quality
had
ever
had
the
chance
to
do
while
i
was
thus
speaking
my
lord
the
duke
writhed
on
his
chair
and
seemed
as
though
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
me
to
the
end
then
when
i
had
concluded
he
rejoined
you
are
disposed
to
work
for
me
i
will
treat
you
in
a
way
that
will
astonish
you
provided
the
fruits
of
your
labours
give
me
satisfaction
of
which
i
have
no
i
poor
unhappy
mortal
burning
with
desire
to
show
the
noble
school
of
florence
that
after
leaving
her
in
youth
i
had
practised
other
branches
of
the
art
than
she
imagined
gave
answer
to
the
duke
that
i
would
willingly
erect
for
him
in
marble
or
in
bronze
a
mighty
statue
on
his
fine
piazza
he
replied
that
for
a
first
essay
he
should
like
me
to
produce
a
perseus
he
had
long
set
his
heart
on
having
such
a
monument
and
he
begged
me
to
begin
a
model
for
the
same
i
very
gladly
set
myself
to
the
task
and
in
a
few
weeks
i
finished
my
model
which
was
about
a
cubit
high
in
yellow
wax
and
very
delicately
finished
in
all
its
details
i
had
made
it
with
the
most
thorough
study
and
art
the
duke
returned
to
florence
but
several
days
passed
before
i
had
an
opportunity
of
showing
my
model
it
seemed
indeed
as
though
he
had
never
set
eyes
on
me
or
spoken
with
me
and
this
caused
me
to
augur
ill
of
my
future
dealings
with
his
excellency
later
on
however
one
day
after
dinner
i
took
it
to
his
wardrobe
where
he
came
to
inspect
it
with
the
duchess
and
a
few
gentlemen
of
the
court
no
sooner
had
he
seen
it
than
he
expressed
much
pleasure
and
extolled
it
to
the
skies
wherefrom
i
gathered
some
hope
that
he
might
really
be
a
connoisseur
of
art
after
having
well
considered
it
for
some
time
always
with
greater
satisfaction
he
began
as
follows
you
could
only
execute
this
little
model
benvenuto
with
the
same
perfection
on
a
large
scale
it
would
be
the
finest
piece
in
the
i
replied
excellent
my
lord
upon
the
piazza
are
now
standing
works
by
the
great
donatello
and
the
incomparable
michel
angelo
the
two
greatest
men
who
have
ever
lived
since
the
days
of
the
ancients
but
since
your
excellence
encourages
my
model
with
such
praise
i
feel
the
heart
to
execute
it
at
least
thrice
as
well
in
no
slight
dispute
arose
upon
this
declaration
the
duke
protesting
that
he
understood
these
matters
perfectly
and
was
quite
aware
what
could
be
done
i
rejoined
that
my
achievements
would
resolve
his
dubitations
and
debates
i
was
absolutely
sure
of
being
able
to
perform
far
more
than
i
had
promised
for
his
excellency
but
that
he
must
give
me
means
for
carrying
my
work
out
else
i
could
not
fulfil
my
undertaking
in
return
for
this
his
excellency
bade
me
formulate
my
demands
in
a
petition
detailing
all
my
requirements
he
would
see
them
liberally
attended
to
it
is
certain
that
if
i
had
been
cunning
enough
to
secure
by
contract
all
i
wanted
for
my
work
i
should
not
have
incurred
the
great
troubles
which
came
upon
me
through
my
own
fault
but
he
showed
the
strongest
desire
to
have
the
work
done
and
the
most
perfect
willingness
to
arrange
preliminaries
i
therefore
not
discerning
that
he
was
more
a
merchant
than
a
duke
dealt
very
frankly
with
his
excellency
just
as
if
i
had
to
do
with
a
prince
and
not
with
a
commercial
man
i
sent
in
my
petition
to
which
he
replied
in
large
and
ample
terms
the
memorandum
ran
as
follows
rare
and
excellent
my
patron
petitions
of
any
validity
and
compacts
between
us
of
any
value
do
not
rest
upon
words
or
writings
the
whole
point
is
that
i
should
succeed
in
my
work
according
to
my
promise
and
if
i
so
succeed
i
feel
convinced
that
your
most
illustrious
excellency
will
very
well
remember
what
you
have
engaged
to
do
for
this
language
so
charmed
the
duke
both
with
my
ways
of
acting
and
of
speaking
that
he
and
the
duchess
began
to
treat
me
with
extraordinary
marks
of
favour
note
this
duchess
was
eleonora
di
toledo
well
known
to
us
through
portrait
note
this
school
was
the
collegio
dei
maestri
di
belle

in
florence
who
had
hitherto
known
of
cellini
mainly
as
a
goldsmith
note

chose
the
subject
of

because
it
symbolised
his
own
victory
over
the
gorgon

of
these
masterpieces
stood
together
there
with

this
is
probably
the
precious
model
now
existing
in

many
points
more
interesting
than

note
it
is
difficult
to
give
the
exact
sense
of
and
in
the
text
but
i
think
the
drift
of
the
sentence
is
rendered
above
liv
being
now
inflamed
with
a
great
desire
to
begin
working
i
told
his
excellency
that
i
had
need
of
a
house
where
i
could
install
myself
and
erect
furnaces
in
order
to
commence
operations
in
clay
and
bronze
and
also
according
to
their
separate
requirements
in
gold
and
silver
i
knew
that
he
was
well
aware
how
thoroughly
i
could
serve
him
in
those
several
branches
and
i
required
some
dwelling
fitted
for
my
business
in
order
that
his
excellency
might
perceive
how
earnestly
i
wished
to
work
for
him
i
had
already
chosen
a
convenient
house
in
a
quarter
much
to
my
liking
as
i
did
not
want
to
trench
upon
his
excellency
for
money
or
anything
of
that
sort
i
had
brought
with
me
from
france
two
jewels
with
which
i
begged
him
to
purchase
me
the
house
and
to
keep
them
until
i
earned
it
with
my
labour
these
jewels
were
excellently
executed
by
my
workmen
after
my
own
designs
when
he
had
inspected
them
with
minute
attention
he
uttered
these
spirited
words
which
clothed
my
soul
with
a
false
hope
back
your
jewels
benvenuto
i
want
you
and
not
them
you
shall
have
your
house
free
of
after
this
he
signed
a
rescript
underneath
the
petition
i
had
drawn
up
and
which
i
have
always
preserved
among
my
papers
the
rescript
ran
as
follows
the
house
be
seen
to
and
who
is
the
vendor
and
at
what
price
for
we
wish
to
comply
with
i
naturally
thought
that
this
would
secure
me
in
possession
of
the
house
being
over
and
above
convinced
that
my
performances
must
far
exceed
what
i
promised
his
excellency
committed
the
execution
of
these
orders
to
his
majordomo
who
was
named
ser
pier
francesco
riccio
the
man
came
from
prato
and
had
been
the
pedagogue
i
talked
then
to
this
donkey
and
described
my
requirements
for
there
was
a
garden
adjoining
the
house
on
which
i
wanted
to
erect
a
workshop
he
handed
the
matter
over
to
a
paymaster
dry
and
meagre
who
bore
the
name
of
lattanzio
gorini
this
flimsy
little
fellow
with
his
tiny
hands
and
small
voice
moved
about
the
business
at
a
pace
yet
in
an
evil
hour
he
sent
me
stones
sand
and
lime
enough
to
build
perhaps
a
with
careful
management
when
i
saw
how
coldly
things
were
going
forward
i
began
to
feel
dismayed
however
i
said
to
myself
beginnings
sometimes
have
great
endings
and
i
fostered
hope
in
my
heart
by
noticing
how
many
thousand
ducats
had
recently
been
squandered
upon
ugly
pieces
of
bad
sculpture
turned
out
by
that
beast
of
a
buaccio
bandinelli
so
i
rallied
my
spirits
and
kept
prodding
at
lattanzio
gorini
to
make
him
go
a
little
faster
it
was
like
shouting
to
a
pack
of
lame
donkeys
with
a
blind
dwarf
for
their
driver
under
these
difficulties
and
by
the
use
of
my
own
money
i
had
soon
marked
out
the
foundations
of
the
workshop
and
cleared
the
ground
of
trees
and
vines
labouring
on
according
to
my
wont
with
fire
and
perhaps
a
trifle
of
impatience
on
the
other
side
i
was
in
the
hands
of
tasso
the
carpenter
a
great
friend
of
mine
who
had
received
my
instructions
for
making
a
wooden
framework
to
set
up
the
perseus
this
tasso
was
a
most
excellent
craftsman
the
best
i
believe
who
ever
lived
in
his
own
branch
of
art
personally
he
was
gay
and
merry
be

and
whenever
i
went
to
see
him
he
met
me
laughing
with
some
little
song
in
falsetto
on
his
lips
half
in
despair
as
i
then
was
news
coming
that
my
affairs
in
france
were
going
wrong
and
these
in
florence
promising
but
ill
through
the
of
my
patron
i
could
never
stop
listening
till
half
the
song
was
finished
and
so
in
the
end
i
used
to
cheer
up
a
little
with
my
friend
and
drove
away
as
well
as
i
was
able
some
few
of
the
gloomy
thoughts
which
weighed
upon
me

i
had
got
all
the
things
in
order
and
was
making
vigorous
preparations
for
my
great
undertaking
indeed
a
portion
of
the
lime
had
been
already
used
when
i
received
sudden
notice
to
appear
before
the
majordomo
i
found
him
after
his
dinner
in
the
hall
of
the
clock
on
entering
i
paid
him
marked
respect
and
he
received
me
with
the
greatest
stiffness
then
he
asked
who
had
installed
me
in
the
house
and
by
whose
authority
i
had
begun
to
build
there
saying
he
marvelled
much
that
i
had
been
so
headstrong
and
foolhardy
i
answered
that
i
had
been
installed
in
the
house
by
his
excellency
and
that
his
lordship
himself
in
the
name
of
his
excellency
had
given
the
orders
to
lattanzio
gorini
brought
stone
sand
and
lime
and
provided
what
i
wanted
saying
he
did
so
at
your
when
i
had
thus
spoken
the
brute
turned
upon
me
with
still
greater
tartness
vowing
that
neither
i
nor
any
of
those
whom
i
had
mentioned
spoke
the
truth
this
stung
me
to
the
quick
and
i
exclaimed
majordomo
so
long
as
your
lordship
chooses
to
use
language
befitting
the
high
office
which
you
hold
i
shall
revere
you
and
speak
to
you
as
respectfully
as
i
do
to
the
duke
if
you
take
another
line
with
me
i
shall
address
you
as
but
one
ser
pier
francesco
he
flew
into
such
a
rage
that
i
thought
he
meant
to
go
mad
upon
the
spot
anticipating
the
time
ordained
by
heaven
for
him
to
do
so
pouring
forth
a
torrent
of
abuse
he
roared
out
that
he
was
surprised
at
himself
for
having
let
me
speak
at
all
to
a
man
of
his
quality
thereupon
my
blood
was
up
and
i
cried
my
words
then
ser
pier
francesco
riccio
i
will
tell
you
what
sort
of
men
are
my
equals
and
who
are
yours
mere
teachers
of
the
alphabet
to
children
his
face
contracted
with
a
spasm
while
he
raised
his
voice
and
repeated
the
same
words
in
a
still
more
insulting
tone
i
too
assumed
an
air
of
menace
and
matching
his
own
arrogance
with
something
of
the
same
sort
told
him
plainly
that
men
of
my
kind
were
worthy
to
converse
with
popes
and
emperors
and
great
kings
and
that
perhaps
there
were
not
two
such
men
alive
upon
this
earth
while
ten
of
his
sort
might
be
met
at
every
doorway
on
hearing
these
words
he
jumped
upon
a
in
the
hall
there
and
defied
me
to
repeat
what
i
had
said
i
did
so
with
still
greater
heat
and
spirit
adding
i
had
no
farther
mind
to
serve
the
duke
and
that
i
should
return
to
france
where
i
was
always
welcome
the
brute
remained
there
stupefied
and
pale
as
clay
i
went
off
furious
resolved
on
leaving
florence
and
would
to
god
that
i
had
done
so
the
duke
can
not
i
think
have
been
informed
at
once
of
this
diabolical
scene
for
i
waited
several
days
without
hearing
from
him
giving
up
all
thoughts
of
florence
except
what
concerned
the
settlement
of
my
and
affairs
i
made
preparations
to
provide
for
them
as
well
as
i
could
with
the
small
amount
of
money
i
had
brought
and
then
to
return
to
france
and
never
set
my
foot
in
italy
again
this
being
my
firm
purpose
i
had
no
intention
to
ask
leave
of
the
duke
or
anybody
but
to
decamp
as
quickly
as
i
could
when
one
morning
the
majordomo
of
his
own
accord
sent
very
humbly
to
entreat
my
presence
and
opened
a
long
pedantic
oration
in
which
i
could
discover
neither
method
nor
elegance
nor
meaning
nor
head
nor
tail
i
only
gathered
from
it
that
he
professed
himself
a
good
christian
wished
to
bear
no
man
malice
and
asked
me
in
the
name
what
salary
i
should
be
willing
to
accept
hearing
this
i
stood
a
while
on
guard
and
made
no
answer
being
firmly
resolved
not
to
engage
myself
when
he
saw
that
i
refused
to
reply
he
had
at
least
the
cleverness
to
put
in
dukes
expect
to
be
answered
and
what
i
am
saying
to
you
i
am
saying
from
his
then
i
rejoined
that
if
the
message
came
from
his
excellency
i
would
gladly
reply
and
told
him
to
report
to
the
duke
that
i
could
not
accept
a
position
inferior
to
that
of
any
one
employed
by
him
as
artist
the
majordomo
answered
receives
two
hundred
crowns
a
year
if
then
you
are
contented
with
that
your
salary
is
i
agreed
upon
these
terms
adding
that
what
i
might
earn
in
addition
by
the
merit
of
my
performances
could
be
given
after
they
were
seen
that
point
i
left
entirely
to
the
good
judgment
of
his
excellency
thus
then
against
my
will
i
pieced
the
broken
thread
again
and
set
to
work
the
duke
continually
treating
me
with
the
highest
imaginable
marks
of
favour
note
one
of
the
rooms
in
the
palazzo
vecchio
so
called
because
the
famous
cosmographical
timepiece
made
about
for
lorenzo
medici
by
lorenzo
della
volpaia
stood
there
note
it
was
the
custom
at
that
epoch
to
address
princes
by
the
title
of
or
signoria
gentlemen
armigeri
had
the
title
of
simple
was
given
to
plebeians
with
some
civil
or
ecclesiastical
dignity
note
vasari
in
his
of
montorsoli
says
in
effect
that
this
riccio
died
about
after
having
been
insane
several
years
lvi
i
received
frequent
letters
from
france
written
by
my
most
faithful
friend
messer
guido
guidi
as
yet
they
told
nothing
but
good
news
and
ascanio
also
bade
me
enjoy
myself
without
uneasiness
since
if
anything
happened
he
would
let
me
know
at
once
now
the
king
was
informed
that
i
had
commenced
working
for
the
duke
of
florence
and
being
the
best
man
in
the
world
he
often
asked
does
not
benvenuto
come
back
to
us
he
put
searching
questions
on
the
subject
to
my
two
workmen
both
of
whom
replied
that
i
kept
writing
i
was
well
off
where
i
was
adding
they
thought
i
did
not
want
to
the
service
of
his
majesty
incensed
by
these
presumptuous
words
which
were
none
of
my
saying
the
king
exclaimed
he
left
us
without
any
cause
i
shall
not
recall
him
let
him
stay
where
he
thus
the
thievish
brigands
brought
matters
exactly
to
the
pass
they
desired
for
if
i
had
returned
to
france
they
would
have
become
mere
workmen
under
me
once
more
whereas
while
i
remained
away
they
were
their
own
masters
and
in
my
place
consequently
they
did
everything
in
their
power
to
prevent
my
coming
back
lvii
while
the
workshop
for
executing
my
perseus
was
in
building
i
used
to
work
in
a
room
here
i
modelled
the
statue
in
plaster
giving
it
the
same
dimensions
as
the
bronze
was
meanst
to
have
and
intending
to
cast
it
from
this
mould
but
finding
that
it
would
take
rather
long
to
carry
it
out
in
this
way
i
resolved
upon
another
expedient
especially
as
now
a
wretched
little
studio
had
been
erected
brick
on
brick
so
miserably
built
that
the
mere
recollection
of
it
gives
me
pain
so
then
i
began
the
figure
of
medusa
and
constructed
the
skeleton
in
iron
afterwards
i
put
on
the
clay
and
when
that
was
modelled
baked
it
i
had
no
assistants
except
some
little
shopboys
among
whom
was
one
of
great
beauty
he
was
the
son
of
a
prostitute
called
la
gambetta
i
made
use
of
the
lad
as
a
model
for
the
only
books
which
teach
this
art
are
the
natural
human
body
meanwhile
as
i
could
not
do
everything
alone
i
looked
about
for
workmen
in
order
to
put
the
business
quickly
through
but
i
was
unable
to
find
any
there
were
indeed
some
in
florence
who
would
willingly
have
come
but
bandinello
prevented
them
and
after
keeping
me
in
want
of
aid
awhile
told
the
duke
that
i
was
trying
to
entice
his
because
i
was
quite
incapable
of
setting
up
so
great
a
statue
by
myself
i
complained
to
the
duke
of
the
annoyance
which
the
brute
gave
me
and
begged
him
to
allow
me
some
of
the
labourers
from
the
opera
my
request
inclined
him
to
lend
ear
to
calumnies
and
when
i
noticed
that
i
set
about
to
do
my
utmost
by
myself
alone
the
labour
was
enormous
i
had
to
strain
every
muscle
night
and
day
and
just
then
the
husband
of
my
sister
sickened
and
died
after
a
few
illness
he
left
my
sister
still
young
with
six
girls
of
all
ages
on
my
hands
this
was
the
first
great
trial
i
endured
in
florence
to
be
made
the
father
and
guardian
of
such
a
distressed
family
note
that
is
the
opera
del
duomo
or
permanent
establishment
for
attending
to
the
fabric
of
the
florentine
cathedral
lviii
in
my
anxiety
that
nothing
should
go
wrong
i
sent
for
two
to
clear
my
garden
of
rubbish
they
came
from
ponte
vecchio
the
one
an
old
man
of
sixty
years
the
other
a
young
fellow
of
eighteen
after
employing
them
about
three
days
the
lad
told
me
that
the
old
man
would
not
work
and
that
i
had
better
send
him
away
since
beside
being
idle
he
prevented
his
comrade
from
working
the
little
i
had
to
do
there
could
be
done
by
himself
without
throwing
money
away
on
other
people
the
youth
was
called
bernardino
mannellini
of
mugello
when
i
saw
that
he
was
so
inclined
to
labour
i
asked
whether
he
would
enter
my
service
and
we
agreed
upon
the
spot
he
groomed
my
horse
gardened
and
soon
essayed
to
help
me
in
the
workshop
with
such
success
that
by
degrees
he
learned
the
art
quite
nicely
i
never
had
a
better
assistant
than
he
proved
having
made
up
my
mind
to
accomplish
the
whole
affair
with
this
aid
i
now
let
the
duke
know
that
bandinello
was
lying
and
that
i
could
get
on
famously
without
his
workpeople
just
at
this
time
i
suffered
slightly
in
the
loins
and
being
unable
to
work
hard
i
was
glad
to
pass
my
time
in
the
wardrobe
with
a
couple
of
young
goldsmiths
called
gianpagolo
and
domenico
poggini
who
made
a
little
golden
cup
under
my
direction
it
was
chased
in
with
figures
and
other
pretty
ornaments
and
his
excellency
meant
it
for
the
duchess
to
drink
water
out
of
he
furthermore
commissioned
me
to
execute
a
golden
belt
which
i
enriched
with
gems
and
delicate
masks
and
other
fancies
the
duke
came
frequently
into
the
wardrobe
and
took
great
pleasure
in
watching
me
at
work
and
talking
to
me
when
my
health
improved
i
had
clay
brought
and
took
a
portrait
of
his
excellency
considerably
larger
than
which
i
modelled
while
he
stayed
with
me
for
pastime
he
was
highly
delighted
with
this
piece
and
conceived
such
a
liking
for
me
that
he
earnestly
begged
me
to
take
up
my
working
quarters
in
the
palace
selecting
rooms
large
enough
for
my
purpose
and
fitting
them
up
with
furnaces
and
all
i
wanted
for
he
greatly
enjoyed
watching
the
processes
of
art
i
replied
that
this
was
impossible
i
should
not
have
finished
my
undertakings
in
a
hundred
years
note
these
two
brothers
were
specially
eminent
as
gianpagolo
went
to
spain
and
served
philip
ii
lix
the
duchess
also
treated
me
with
extraordinary
graciousness
and
would
have
been
pleased
if
i
had
worked
for
her
alone
forgetting
perseus
and
everything
besides
i
for
my
part
while
these
vain
favours
were
being
showered
upon
me
knew
only
too
well
that
my
perverse
and
biting
fortune
could
not
long
delay
to
send
me
some
fresh
calamity
because
i
kept
ever
before
my
eyes
the
great
mistake
i
had
committed
while
seeking
to
do
a
good
action
i
refer
to
my
affairs
in
france
the
king
could
not
swallow
the
displeasure
he
felt
at
my
departure
and
yet
he
wanted
me
to
return
if
only
this
could
be
brought
about
without
concessions
on
his
part
i
thought
that
i
was
entirely
in
the
right
and
would
not
bend
submissively
because
i
judged
that
if
i
wrote
in
humble
terms
those
enemies
of
mine
would
say
in
their
french
fashion
that
i
had
confessed
myself
to
blame
and
that
certain
misdoings
with
which
they
wrongfully
taxed
me
were
proved
true
therefore
i
stood
upon
my
honour
and
wrote
in
terms
of
haughty
coldness
which
was
precisely
what
those
two
traitors
my
apprentices
most
heartily
desired
in
my
letters
to
them
i
boasted
of
the
distinguished
kindness
shown
me
in
my
own
birthplace
by
a
prince
and
princess
the
absolute
masters
of
florence
whenever
they
received
one
of
these
despatches
they
went
to
the
king
and
besieged
his
majesty
with
entreaties
for
the
castle
upon
the
same
terms
as
he
had
granted
it
to
me
the
king
who
was
a
man
of
great
goodness
and
perspicacity
would
never
consent
to
the
presumptuous
demands
of
those
scoundrels
since
he
scented
the
malignity
of
their
aims
yet
wishing
to
keep
them
in
expectation
and
to
give
me
the
opportunity
of
coming
back
he
caused
an
angry
letter
to
be
written
to
me
by
his
treasurer
messer
giuliano
buonaccorsi
a
burgher
of
florence
the
substance
was
as
follows
if
i
wanted
to
preserve
the
reputation
for
honesty
which
i
had
hitherto
enjoyed
it
was
my
plain
duty
after
leaving
france
with
no
cause
whatsoever
to
render
an
account
of
all
that
i
had
done
and
dealt
with
for
his
majesty
the
receipt
of
this
letter
gave
me
such
pleasure
that
if
i
had
consulted
my
own
palate
i
could
not
have
wished
for
either
more
or
less
i
sat
down
to
write
an
answer
and
filled
nine
pages
of
ordinary
paper
in
this
document
i
described
in
detail
all
the
works
which
i
had
executed
and
all
the
adventures
i
had
gone
through
while
performing
them
and
all
the
sums
which
had
been
spent
upon
them
the
payments
had
always
been
made
through
two
notaries
and
one
of
his
treasurers
and
i
could
show
receipts
from
all
the
men
into
whose
hands
they
passed
whether
for
goods
supplied
or
labour
rendered
i
had
not
pocketed
one
penny
of
the
money
nor
had
i
received
any
reward
for
my
completed
works
i
brought
back
with
me
into
italy
nothing
but
some
marks
of
favour
and
most
royal
promises
truly
worthy
of
his
majesty
though
i
can
not
vaunt
myself
of
any
recompense
beyond
the
salaries
appointed
for
my
maintenance
in
france
seven
hundred
golden
crowns
of
which
are
still
due
inasmuch
as
i
abstained
from
drawing
them
until
i
could
employ
them
on
my
yet
knowing
that
malicious
foes
out
of
their
envious
hearts
have
played
some
knavish
trick
against
me
i
feel
confident
that
truth
will
prevail
i
take
pride
in
his
most
christian
majesty
and
am
not
moved
by
avarice
i
am
indeed
aware
of
having
performed
for
him
far
more
than
i
undertook
and
albeit
the
promised
reward
has
not
been
given
me
my
one
anxiety
is
to
remain
in
his
opinion
that
man
of
probity
and
honour
which
i
have
always
been
if
your
majesty
entertains
the
least
doubt
upon
this
point
i
will
fly
to
render
an
account
of
my
conduct
at
the
risk
even
of
my
life
but
noticing
in
what
slight
esteem
i
am
held
i
have
had
no
mind
to
come
back
and
make
an
offer
of
myself
knowing
that
i
shall
never
lack
for
bread
whithersoever
i
may
go
if
however
i
am
called
for
i
will
always
the
letter
contained
many
further
particulars
worthy
of
the
attention
and
proper
to
the
preservation
of
my
honour
before
despatching
it
i
took
it
to
the
duke
who
read
it
with
interest
then
i
sent
it
into
france
addressed
to
the
cardinal
of
ferrara
lx
about
this
time
bernardone
baldini
broker
in
jewels
to
the
duke
brought
a
big
diamond
from
venice
which
weighed
more
than
carats
antonio
son
of
vittorio
landi
was
also
interested
in
getting
the
duke
to
purchase
it
the
stone
had
been
cut
with
a
point
but
since
it
did
not
yield
the
purity
of
lustre
which
one
expects
in
such
a
diamond
its
owners
had
cropped
the
point
and
in
truth
it
was
not
exactly
fit
for
either
point
or
table
cutting
our
duke
who
greatly
delighted
in
gems
though
he
was
not
a
sound
judge
of
them
held
out
good
hopes
to
the
rogue
bernardaccio
that
he
would
buy
this
stone
and
the
fellow
wanting
to
secure
for
himself
alone
the
honour
of
palming
it
off
upon
the
duke
of
florence
abstained
from
taking
his
partner
antonio
landi
into
the
secret
now
landi
had
been
my
intimate
friend
from
childhood
and
when
he
saw
that
i
enjoyed
the
confidence
he
called
me
aside
it
was
just
before
noon
at
a
corner
of
the
mercato
nuovo
and
spoke
as
follows
i
am
convinced
that
the
duke
will
show
you
a
diamond

he
seems
disposed
to
buy
you
will
find
it
a
big
stone
pray
assist
the
purchase
i
can
give
it
for
seventeen
thousand
crowns
i
feel
sure
he
will
ask
your
advice
and
if
you
see
that
he
has
a
mind
for
it
we
will
contrive
that
he
secures
antonio
professed
great
confidence
in
being
able
to
complete
the
bargain
for
the
jewel
at
that
price
in
reply
i
told
him
that
if
my
advice
was
taken
i
would
speak
according
to
my
judgment
without
prejudice
to
the
diamond
as
i
have
above
related
the
duke
came
daily
into
our
workshop
for
several
hours
and
about
a
week
after
this
conversation
with
antonio
landi
he
showed
me
one
day
after
dinner
the
diamond
in
question
which
i
immediately
recognised
by
its
description
both
as
to
form
and
weight
i
have
already
said
that
its
water
was
not
quite
transparent
for
which
reason
it
had
been
cropped
so
when
i
found
it
of
that
kind
and
quality
i
felt
certainly
disinclined
to
recommend
its
acquisition
however
i
asked
his
excellency
what
he
wanted
me
to
say
because
it
was
one
thing
for
jewellers
to
value
a
stone
after
a
prince
had
bought
it
and
another
thing
to
estimate
it
with
a
view
to
purchase
he
replied
that
he
bought
it
and
that
he
only
wanted
my
opinion
i
did
not
choose
to
abstain
from
hinting
what
i
really
thought
about
the
stone
then
he
told
me
to
observe
the
beauty
of
its
great
facets
i
answered
that
this
feature
of
the
diamond
was
not
so
great
a
beauty
as
his
excellency
supposed
but
came
from
the
point
having
been
cropped
at
these
words
my
prince
who
perceive
that
i
was
speaking
the
truth
made
a
wry
face
and
bade
me
give
good
heed
to
valuing
the
stone
and
saying
what
i
thought
it
worth
i
reckoned
that
since
landi
had
offered
it
to
me
for
crowns
the
duke
might
have
got
it
for
at
the
highest
so
noticing
that
he
would
take
it
ill
if
i
spoke
the
truth
i
made
my
mind
up
to
uphold
him
in
his
false
opinion
and
handing
back
the
diamond
said
will
probably
have
paid
on
hearing
this
the
duke
uttered
a
loud
opening
his
mouth
as
wide
as
a
well
and
cried
out
am
i
convinced
that
you
understand
nothing
about
the
i
retorted
are
certainly
in
the
wrong
there
my
lord
do
you
attend
to
maintaining
the
credit
of
your
diamond
while
i
attend
to
understanding
my
trade
but
pray
tell
me
at
least
how
much
you
paid
in
order
that
i
may
learn
to
understand
it
according
to
the
way
of
your
the
duke
rose
and
with
a
little
sort
of
angry
grin
replied
thousand
crowns
and
more
benvenuto
did
that
stone
cost
me
having
thus
spoken
he
departed
giovanpagolo
and
domenico
poggini
the
goldsmiths
were
present
and
bachiacca
the
embroiderer
who
was
working
in
an
adjacent
room
ran
up
at
the
noise
i
told
them
that
i
should
never
have
advised
the
duke
to
purchase
it
but
if
his
heart
was
set
on
having
it
antonio
landi
had
offered
me
the
stone
eight
days
ago
for
crowns
i
think
i
could
have
got
it
for
or
less
but
the
duke
apparently
wishes
to
maintain
his
gem
in
credit
for
when
antonio
landi
was
willing
to
let
it
go
at
that
price
how
the
devil
can
bernardone
have
played
off
such
a
shameful
trick
upon
his
excellency
never
imagining
that
the
matter
stood
precisely
as
the
duke
averred

laughingly
made
light
of
his
supposed
credulity

meanwhile
i
was
advancing
with
my
great
statue
of
medusa
i
had
covered
the
iron
skeleton
with
clay
which
i
modelled
like
an
anatomical
subject
and
about
half
an
inch
thinner
than
the
bronze
would
be

i
baked
well
and
then
began
to
spread
on
the
wax
surface
in
order
to
complete
the
figure
to
my
liking
the
duke
who
often
came
to
inspect
it
was
so
anxious
lest
i
should
not
succeed
with
the
bronze
that
he
wanted
me
to
call
in
some
master
to
case
it
for
me
he
was
continually
talking
in
the
highest
terms
of
my
acquirements
and
accomplishments
this
made
his
majordomo
no
less
continually
eager
to
devise
some
trap
for
making
me
break
my
neck
now
his
post
at
court
gave
him
authority
with
the
and
all
the
officers
in
the
poor
unhappy
town
of
florence
only
to
think
that
a
fellow
from
prato
our
hereditary
foeman
the
son
of
a
cooper
and
the
most
ignorant
creature
in
existence
should
have
risen
to
such
a
station
of
influence
merely
because
he
had
been
the
rotten
tutor
of
cosimo
medici
before
he
became
duke
well
as
i
have
said
he
kept
ever
on
the
watch
to
serve
me
some
ill
turn
and
finding
that
he
could
not
catch
me
out
on
any
side
he
fell
at
last
upon
this
plan
which
meant
mischief
he
betook
himself
to
gambetta
the
mother
of
my
apprentice
cencio
and
this
precious
pair
together
that
knave
of
a
pedant
and
that
rogue
of
a
strumpet
invented
a
scheme
for
giving
me
such
a
fright
as
would
make
me
leave
florence
in
hot
haste
gambetta
yielding
to
the
instinct
of
her
trade
went
out
acting
under
the
orders
of
that
mad
knavish
pedant
the
majordomo
i
must
add
that
they
had
also
gained
over
the
bargello
a
bolognese
whom
the
duke
afterwards
dismissed
for
similar
conspiracies
well
one
evening
after
sunset
gambetta
came
to
my
house
with
her
son
and
told
me
she
had
kept
him
several
days
indoors
for
my
welfare
i
answered
that
there
was
no
reason
to
keep
him
shut
up
on
my
account
and
laughing
her
whorish
arts
to
scorn
i
turned
to
the
boy
in
her
presence
and
said
these
words
know
cencio
whether
i
have
sinned
with
you
he
began
to
shed
tears
and
answered
upon
this
the
mother
shaking
her
head
cried
out
at
him
you
little
scoundrel
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
how
these
things
happen
then
she
turned
to
me
and
begged
me
to
keep
the
lad
hidden
in
my
house
because
the
bargello
was
after
him
and
would
seize
him
anywhere
outside
my
house
but
there
they
would
not
dare
to
touch
him
i
made
answer
that
in
my
house
lived
my
widowed
sister
and
six
girls
of
holy
life
and
that
i
wanted
nobody
else
there
upon
that
she
related
that
the
majordomo
had
given
orders
to
the
bargello
and
that
i
should
certainly
be
taken
up
only
if
i
would
not
harbour
her
son
i
might
square
accounts
by
paying
her
a
hundred
crowns
the
majordomo
was
her
crony
and
i
might
rest
assured
that
she
could
work
him
to
her
liking
provided
i
paid
down
the
hundred
crowns
this
cozenage
goaded
me
into
such
a
fury
that
i
cried
with
you
shameful
strumpet
were
it
not
for
my
good
reputation
and
for
the
innocence
of
this
unhappy
boy
of
yours
here
i
should
long
ago
have
cut
your
throat
with
the
dagger
at
my
side
and
twice
or
thrice
i
have
already
clasped
my
fingers
on
the
with
words
to
this
effect
and
many
ugly
blows
to
boot
i
drove
the
woman
and
her
son
into
the
street
note
this
is
an
important
passage
which
has
not
i
think
been
properly
understood
by
translators
it
describes
the
process
he
now
employed
in
preparing
a
mould
for
first
it
seems
he
made
a
solid
clay
model
somewhat
smaller
than
the
bronze
was
meant
to
be
this
he
overlaid
with
wax
and
then
took
a
hollow
mould
of
the
figure
thus
formed
farther
on
we
shall
see
how
he
withdrew
the
wax
from
the
hollow
mould
leaving
the
solid
model
inside
with
space
enough
between
them
for
the
metal
to
flow
in
lxii
when
i
reflected
on
the
roguery
and
power
of
that
pedant
i
judged
it
best
to
give
a
wide
berth
to
his
infernal
machinations
so
early
next
morning
i
mounted
my
horse
and
took
the
road
for
venice
leaving
in
my
hands
jewels
and
articles
to
the
value
of
nearly
two
thousand
crowns
i
took
with
me
my
servant
bernardino
of
mugello
and
when
i
reached
ferrara
i
wrote
word
to
his
excellency
the
duke
that
though
i
had
gone
off
without
being
sent
i
should
come
back
again
without
being
called
for
on
arriving
at
venice
and
pondering
upon
the
divers
ways
my
cruel
fortune
took
to
torment
me
yet
at
the
same
time
feeling
myself
none
the
less
sound
in
health
and
hearty
i
made
up
my
mind
to
fence
with
her
according
to
my
wont
while
thus
engrossed
in
thoughts
about
my
own
affairs
i
went
abroad
for
pastime
through
that
beautiful
and
sumptuous
city
and
paid
visits
to
the
admirable
painter
titian
and
to
jacopo
del
sansovino
our
able
sculptor
and
architect
from
florence
the
latter
enjoyed
an
excellent
appointment
under
the
signoria
of
venice
and
we
had
been
acquainted
during
our
youth
in
rome
and
florence
these
two
men
of
genius
received
me
with
marked
kindness
the
day
afterwards
i
met
messer
lorenzo
medici
who
took
me
by
the
hand
at
once
giving
me
the
warmest
welcome
which
could
be
imagined
because
we
had
known
each
other
in
florence
when
i
was
coining
for
duke
alessandro
and
afterwards
in
paris
while
i
was
in
the
service
at
that
time
he
sojourned
in
the
house
of
messer
giuliano
buonaccorsi
and
having
nowhere
else
to
go
for
pastime
without
the
greatest
peril
of
his
life
he
used
to
spend
a
large
part
of
the
day
in
my
house
watching
me
working
at
the
great
pieces
i
produced
there
as
i
was
saying
our
former
acquaintance
led
him
to
take
me
by
the
hand
and
bring
me
to
his
dwelling
where
i
found
the
prior
degli
strozzi
brother
of
my
lord
peiro
while
making
good
cheer
together
they
asked
me
how
long
i
intended
to
remain
in
venice
thinking
that
i
was
on
my
return
journey
into
france
to
these
gentlemen
i
replied
that
i
had
left
florence
on
account
of
the
events
i
have
described
above
and
that
i
meant
to
go
back
after
two
or
three
days
in
order
to
resume
my
service
with
the
duke
on
hearing
this
the
prior
and
messer
lorenzo
turned
round
on
me
with
such
sternness
that
i
felt
extremely
uneasy
then
they
said
to
me
would
do
far
better
to
return
to
france
where
you
are
rich
and
well
known
for
if
you
go
back
to
florence
you
will
lose
all
that
you
have
gained
in
france
and
will
earn
nothing
there
but
annoyances
i
made
no
answer
to
these
words
and
departed
the
next
day
as
secretly
as
i
was
able
turning
my
face
again
towards
florence
in
the
meanwhile
that
infernal
plot
had
come
to
a
head
and
broken
for
i
had
written
to
my
great
master
the
duke
giving
him
a
full
account
of
the
causes
of
my
escapade
to
venice
i
went
to
visit
him
without
any
ceremony
and
was
received
with
his
usual
reserve
and
austerity
having
maintained
this
attitude
awhile
he
turned
toward
me
pleasantly
and
asked
where
i
had
been
i
answered
that
my
heart
had
never
moved
one
inch
from
his
most
illustrious
excellency
although
some
weighty
reasons
had
forced
me
to
go
a
roaming
for
a
little
while
then
softening
still
more
in
manner
he
began
to
question
me
concerning
venice
and
after
this
wise
we
conversed
some
space
of
time
at
last
he
bade
me
apply
myself
to
business
and
complete
his
perseus
so
i
returned
home
glad
and
and
comforted
my
family
that
is
to
say
my
sister
and
her
six
daughters
then
i
resumed
my
work
and
pushed
it
forward
as
briskly
as
i
could
note
this
is

murderer
of
alessandro
who
was
himself
assassinated
by
two

bravi

chap
lxiii
the
first
piece
i
cast
in
bronze
was
that
great
bust
the
portrait
of
his
excellency
which
i
had
modelled
in
the
workroom
while
suffering
from
those
pains
in
my
back
it
gave
much
pleasure
when
it
was
completed
though
my
sole
object
in
making
it
was
to
obtain
experience
of
clays
suitable
for
i
was
of
course
aware
that
the
admirable
sculptor
donatello
had
cast
his
bronzes
with
the
clay
of
florence
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
had
met
with
enormous
difficulties
in
their
execution
as
i
thought
that
this
was
due
to
some
fault
in
the
earth
i
wanted
to
make
these
first
experiments
before
i
undertook
my
perseus
from
them
i
learned
that
the
clay
was
good
enough
but
had
not
been
well
understood
by
donatello
inasmuch
as
i
could
see
that
his
pieces
had
been
cast
with
the
very
greatest
trouble
accordingly
as
i
have
described
above
i
prepared
the
earth
by
artificial
methods
and
found
it
serve
me
well
and
with
it
i
cast
the
bust
but
since
i
had
not
yet
constructed
my
own
furnace
i
employed
that
of
maestro
zanobi
di
pagno
a
when
i
saw
that
this
bust
came
out
sharp
and
clean
i
set
at
once
to
construct
a
little
furnace
in
the
workshop
erected
for
me
by
the
duke
after
my
own
plans
and
design
in
the
house
which
the
duke
had
given
me
no
sooner
was
the
furnace
ready
than
i
went
to
work
with
all
diligence
upon
the
casting
of
medusa
that
is
the
woman
twisted
in
a
heap
beneath
the
feet
of
perseus
it
was
an
extremely
difficult
task
and
i
was
anxious
to
observe
all
the
niceties
of
art
which
i
had
learned
so
as
not
to
lapse
into
some
error
the
first
cast
i
took
in
my
furnace
succeeded
in
the
superlative
degree
and
was
so
clean
that
my
friends
thought
i
should
not
need
to
retouch
it
it
is
true
that
certain
germans
and
frenchmen
who
vaunt
the
possession
of
marvellous
secrets
pretend
that
they
can
cast
bronzes
without
retouching
them
but
this
is
really
nonsense
because
the
bronze
when
it
has
first
been
cast
ought
to
be
worked
over
and
beaten
in
with
hammers
and
chisels
according
to
the
manner
of
the
ancients
and
also
to
that
of
the
moderns
i
mean
such
moderns
as
have
known
how
to
work
in
bronze
the
result
of
this
casting
greatly
pleased
his
excellency
who
often
came
to
my
house
to
inspect
it
encouraging
me
by
the
interest
he
showed
to
do
my
best
the
furious
envy
of
bandinello
however
who
kept
always
whispering
in
the
ears
had
such
effect
that
he
made
him
believe
my
first
successes
with
a
single
figure
or
two
proved
nothing
i
should
never
be
able
to
put
the
whole
large
piece
together
since
i
was
new
to
the
craft
and
his
excellency
ought
to
take
good
heed
he
did
not
throw
his
money
away
these
insinuations
operated
so
efficiently
upon
the
illustrious
ears
that
part
of
my
allowance
for
workpeople
was
withdrawn
i
felt
compelled
to
complain
pretty
sharply
to
his
excellency
and
having
gone
to
wait
on
him
one
morning
in
the
via
servi
i
spoke
as
follows
lord
i
do
not
now
receive
the
monies
necessary
for
my
task
which
makes
me
fear
that
your
excellency
has
lost
confidence
in
me
once
more
then
i
tell
you
that
i
feel
quite
able
to
execute
this
statue
three
times
better
than
the
model
as
i
have
before
engaged
my
note
now
in
the
museum
of
the
bargello
palace
at
florence
lxiv
i
could
see
that
this
speech
made
no
impression
on
the
duke
for
he
kept
silence
then
seized
with
sudden
anger
and
a
vehement
emotion
i
began
again
to
address
him
lord
this
city
of
a
truth
has
ever
been
the
school
of
the
most
noble
talents
yet
when
a
man
has
come
to
know
what
he
is
worth
after
gaining
some
acquirements
and
wishing
to
augment
the
glory
of
his
town
and
of
his
glorious
prince
it
is
quite
right
that
he
should
go
and
labour
elsewhere
to
prove
the
truth
of
these
words
i
need
only
remind
your
excellency
of
donatello
and
the
great
lionardo
da
vinci
in
the
past
and
of
our
incomparable
michel
angelo
buonarroti
in
the
present
they
augment
the
glory
of
your
excellency
by
their
genius
i
in
my
turn
feel
the
same
desire
and
hope
to
play
my
part
like
them
therefore
my
lord
give
me
the
leave
to
go
but
beware
of
letting
bandinello
quit
you
rather
bestow
upon
him
always
more
than
he
demands
for
if
he
goes
into
foreign
parts
his
ignorance
is
so
presumptuous
that
he
is
just
the
man
to
disgrace
our
most
illustrious
school
now
grant
me
my
permission
prince
i
ask
no
further
reward
for
my
labours
up
to
this
time
than
the
gracious
favour
of
your
most
illustrious
when
he
saw
the
firmness
of
my
resolution
he
turned
with
some
irritation
and
exclaimed
if
you
want
to
finish
the
statue
you
shall
lack
for
then
i
thanked
him
and
said
i
had
no
greater
desire
than
to
show
those
envious
folk
that
i
had
it
in
me
to
execute
the
promised
work
when
i
left
his
excellency
i
received
some
slight
assistance
but
this
not
being
sufficient
i
had
to
put
my
hand
into
my
own
purse
in
order
to
push
the
work
forward
at
something
better
than
a
pace
it
was
my
custom
to
pass
the
evening
in
the
wardrobe
where
domenico
poggini
and
his
brother
gianpagolo
were
at
work
upon
that
golden
cup
for
the
duchess
and
the
girdle
i
have
already
described
his
excellency
had
also
commissioned
me
to
make
a
little
model
for
a
pendent
to
set
the
great
diamond
which
bernardone
and
antonio
landi
made
him
buy
i
tried
to
get
out
of
doing
it
but
the
duke
compelled
me
by
all
sorts
of
kindly
pressure
to
work
until
four
hours
after
nightfall
he
kept
indeed
enticing
me
to
push
this
job
forward
by
daytime
also
but
i
would
not
consent
although
i
felt
sure
i
should
incur
his
anger
now
one
evening
i
happened
to
arrive
rather
later
than
usual
whereupon
he
said
come
may
you
be
i
answered
lord
that
is
not
my
name
my
name
is
welcome
but
as
i
suppose
your
excellency
is
joking
i
will
add
no
he
replied
that
far
from
joking
he
meant
solemn
earnest
i
had
better
look
to
my
conduct
for
it
had
come
to
his
ears
that
i
relied
upon
his
favour
to
take
in
first
one
man
and
then
another
i
begged
his
most
illustrious
excellency
to
name
a
single
person
whom
i
had
ever
taken
in
at
this
he
flew
into
a
rage
and
said
and
give
back
to
bernardone
what
you
have
of
his
there
i
have
mentioned
i
said
lord
i
thank
you
and
beg
you
to
condescend
so
far
as
to
listen
to
four
words
it
is
true
that
he
lent
me
a
pair
of
old
scales
two
anvils
and
three
little
hammers
which
articles
i
begged
his
workman
giorgio
da
cortona
fifteen
days
ago
to
fetch
back
giorgio
came
for
them
himself
if
your
excellency
can
prove
on
referring
to
those
who
have
spoken
these
calumnies
or
to
others
that
i
have
ever
from
the
day
of
my
birth
till
now
got
any
single
thing
by
fraud
from
anybody
be
it
in
rome
or
be
it
in
france
then
let
your
excellency
punish
me
as
immoderately
as
you
when
the
duke
saw
me
in
this
mighty
passion
he
assumed
the
air
of
a
prudent
and
benevolent
lord
saying
words
are
not
meant
for
therefore
if
it
is
as
you
say
i
shall
always
receive
you
with
the
same
kindness
as
to
this
i
answered
should
like
your
excellency
to
know
that
the
rascalities
of
bernardone
compel
me
to
ask
as
a
favor
how
much
that
big
diamond
with
the
cropped
point
cost
you
i
hope
to
prove
on
what
account
that
scoundrel
tries
to
bring
me
into
then
his
excellency
replied
paid
ducats
for
it
why
do
you
ask
me
my
lord
on
such
a
day
at
such
an
hour
in
a
corner
of
mercato
nuovo
antonio
landi
the
son
of
vittorio
begged
me
to
induce
your
excellency
to
buy
it
and
at
my
first
question
he
asked
ducats
for
the
diamond
now
your
excellency
knows
what
it
has
cost
you
domenico
poggini
and
gianpagolo
his
brother
who
are
present
will
confirm
my
words
for
i
spoke
to
them
at
once
about
it
and
since
that
time
have
never
once
alluded
to
the
matter
because
your
excellency
told
me
i
did
not
understand
these
things
which
made
me
think
you
wanted
to
keep
up
the
credit
of
your
stone
i
should
like
you
to
know
my
lord
that
i
do
understand
and
that
as
regards
my
character
i
consider
myself
no
less
honest
than
any
man
who
ever
lived
upon
this
earth
i
shall
not
try
to
rob
you
of
eight
or
ten
thousand
ducats
at
one
go
but
shall
rather
seek
to
earn
them
by
my
industry
i
entered
the
service
of
your
excellency
as
sculptor
goldsmith
and
stamper
of
coin
but
to
blab
about
my
private
matters
never
what
i
am
now
telling
you
i
say
in
i
do
not
want
my
fee
for
information
if
i
speak
out
in
the
presence
of
so
many
worthy
fellows
as
are
here
it
is
because
i
do
not
wish
your
excellency
to
believe
what
bernardone
tells
when
he
had
heard
this
speech
the
duke
rose
up
in
anger
and
sent
for
bernardone
who
was
forced
to
take
flight
as
far
as
venice
he
and
antonio
landi
with
him
the
latter
told
me
that
he
had
not
meant
that
diamond
but
was
talking
of
another
stone
so
then
they
went
and
came
again
from
venice
whereupon
i
presented
myself
to
the
duke
and
spoke
as
follows
lord
what
i
told
you
is
the
truth
and
what
bernardone
said
about
the
tools
he
lent
me
is
a
lie
you
had
better
put
this
to
the
proof
and
i
will
go
at
once
to
the
the
duke
made
answer
do
your
best
to
be
an
honest
man
as
you
have
done
until
now
you
have
no
cause
for
so
the
whole
matter
passed
off
in
smoke
and
i
heard
not
one
more
word
about
it
i
applied
myself
to
finishing
his
jewel
and
when
i
took
it
to
the
duchess
her
grace
said
that
she
esteemed
my
setting
quite
as
highly
as
the
diamond
which
bernardaccio
had
made
them
buy
she
then
desired
me
to
fasten
it
upon
her
breast
and
handed
me
a
large
pin
with
which
i
fixed
it
and
took
my
leave
in
her
good
favour
afterwards
i
was
informed
that
they
had
the
stone
reset
by
a
german
or
some
other
foreigner
whether
truly
or
not
i
can
not
vouch
upon
suggestion
that
the
diamond
would
show
better
in
a
less
elaborate
setting
note
benvenuto
and
note
he
forgets
that
he
has
said
above
that
it
was
offered
him
by
landi
for
ducats
note
this
fee
was
quarto
or
the
fourth
part
of
the
fine
which
came
to
the
delator
note
it
is
worthy
of
notice
that
from
this
point
onward
the
is
written
by
cellini
in
his
own
hand
lxv
i
believe
have
already
narrated
how
domenico
and
giovanpagolo
poggini
goldsmiths
and
brothers
were
at
work
in
the
wardrobe
upon
some
little
golden
vases
after
my
design
chased
with
figures
in
and
other
ornaments
of
great
distinction
i
oftentimes
kept
saying
to
his
excellency
lord
if
you
will
undertake
to
pay
some
workpeople
i
am
ready
to
strike
coins
for
your
mint
and
medals
with
your
portrait
i
am
willing
to
enter
into
competition
with
the
ancients
and
feel
able
to
surpass
them
for
since
those
early
days
in
which
i
made
the
medals
of
pope
clement
i
have
learned
so
much
that
i
can
now
produce
far
better
pieces
of
the
kind
i
think
i
can
also
outdo
the
coins
i
struck
for
duke
alessandro
which
are
still
held
in
high
esteem
in
like
manner
i
could
make
for
you
large
pieces
of
gold
and
silver
plate
as
i
did
so
often
for
that
noble
monarch
king
francis
of
france
thanks
to
the
great
conveniences
he
allowed
me
without
ever
losing
time
for
the
execution
of
colossal
statues
or
other
works
of
the
to
this
suggestion
the
duke
replied
forward
i
will
see
but
he
never
supplied
me
with
conveniences
or
aid
of
any
kind
one
day
his
most
illustrious
excellency
handed
me
several
pounds
weight
of
silver
and
said
is
some
of
the
silver
from
my
mines
take
it
and
make
a
fine
now
i
did
not
choose
to
neglect
my
perseus
and
at
the
same
time
i
wished
to
serve
the
duke
so
i
entrusted
the
metal
together
with
my
designs
and
models
in
wax
to
a
rascal
called
piero
di
martino
a
goldsmith
by
trade
he
set
the
work
up
badly
and
moreover
ceased
to
labour
at
it
so
that
i
lost
more
time
than
if
i
had
taken
it
in
hand
myself
after
several
months
were
wasted
and
piero
would
neither
work
nor
put
men
to
work
upon
the
piece
i
made
him
give
it
back
i
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
get
back
the
body
of
the
vase
which
he
had
begun
badly
as
i
have
already
said
together
with
the
remainder
of
the
silver
the
duke
hearing
something
of
these
disputes
sent
for
the
vase
and
the
models
and
never
told
me
why
or
wherefore
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
placed
some
of
my
designs
in
the
hands
of
divers
persons
at
venice
and
elsewhere
and
was
very
ill
served
by
them
the
duchess
kept
urging
me
to
do
work
for
her
i
frequently
replied
that
everybody
nay
all
italy
knew
well
i
was
an
excellent
goldsmith
but
italy
had
not
yet
seen
what
i
could
do
in
sculpture
among
artists
certain
enraged
sculptors
laughed
at
me
and
called
me
the
new
sculptor
i
hope
to
show
them
that
i
am
an
old
sculptor
if
god
shall
grant
me
the
boon
of
finishing
my
perseus
for
that
noble
piazza
of
his
most
illustrious
after
this
i
shut
myself
up
at
home
working
day
and
night
not
even
showing
my
face
in
the
palace
i
wished
however
to
keep
myself
in
favour
with
the
duchess
so
i
got
some
little
cups
made
for
her
in
silver
no
larger
than
two
penny
chased
with
exquisite
masks
in
the
rarest
antique
style
when
i
took
them
to
her
excellency
she
received
me
most
graciously
and
repaid
the
gold
and
silver
i
had
spent
upon
them
then
i
made
my
suit
to
her
and
prayed
her
tell
the
duke
that
i
was
getting
small
assistance
for
so
great
a
work
i
begged
her
also
to
warn
him
not
to
lend
so
ready
an
ear
to
evil
tongue
which
hindered
me
from
finishing
my
perseus
in
reply
to
these
lamentable
complaints
the
duchess
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
exclaimed
a
surety
the
duke
ought
only
too
well
to
know
that
this
bandinello
of
his
is
worth
note
silver
mines
were
at
campiglia
and
pietrasantra
he
worked
them
however
rather
at
a
loss
than
profit
lxvi
i
now
stayed
at
home
and
went
rarely
to
the
palace
labouring
with
great
diligence
to
complete
my
statue
i
had
to
pay
the
workmen
out
of
my
own
pocket
for
the
duke
after
giving
lattanzio
gorini
orders
to
discharge
their
wages
at
the
end
of
about
eighteen
months
grew
tired
and
withdrew
this
subsidy
i
asked
lattanzio
why
he
did
not
pay
me
as
usual
the
man
replied
gesticulating
with
those
spidery
hands
of
his
in
a
shrill
voice
do
not
you
finish
your
work
one
thinks
that
you
will
never
get
it
in
a
rage
i
up
and
answered
the
plague
catch
you
and
all
who
dare
to
think
i
shall
not
finish
it
so
i
went
home
with
despair
at
heart
to
my
unlucky
perseus
not
without
weeping
when
i
remembered
the
prosperity
i
had
abandoned
in
paris
under
the
patronage
of
that
marvellous
king
francis
where
i
had
abundance
of
all
kinds
and
here
had
everything
to
want
for
many
a
time
i
had
it
in
my
soul
to
cast
myself
away
for
lost
one
day
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
mounted
a
nice
nag
i
had
put
a
hundred
crowns
in
my
purse
and
went
to
fiesole
to
visit
a
natural
son
of
mine
there
who
was
at
nurse
with
my
gossip
the
wife
of
one
of
my
workpeople
when
i
reached
the
house
i
found
the
boy
in
good
health
and
kissed
him
very
sad
at
heart
on
taking
leave
he
would
not
let
me
go
but
held
me
with
his
little
hands
and
a
tempest
of
cries
and
tears
considering
that
he
was
only
two
years
old
or
thereabouts
the
grief
was
something
wonderful
now
i
had
resolved
in
the
heat
of
my
despair
if
i
met
bandinello
who
went
every
evening
to
a
farm
of
his
above
san
domenico
that
i
would
hurl
him
to
destruction
so
i
disengaged
myself
from
my
baby
and
left
the
boy
there
sobbing
his
heart
out
taking
the
road
toward
florence
just
when
i
entered
the
piazza
of
san
domenico
bandinello
was
arriving
from
the
other
side
on
the
instant
i
decided
upon
bloodshed
but
when
i
reached
the
man
and
raised
my
eyes
i
saw
him
unarmed
riding
a
sorry
mule
or
rather
donkey
and
he
had
with
him
a
boy
of
ten
years
old
no
sooner
did
he
catch
sight
of
me
than
he
turned
the
colour
of
a
corpse
and
trembled
from
head
to
foot
perceiving
at
once
how
base
the
business
would
be
i
exclaimed
not
vile
coward
i
do
not
condescend
to
smite
he
looked
at
me
submissively
and
said
nothing
thereupon
i
recovered
command
of
my
faculties
and
thanked
god
that
his
goodness
had
withheld
me
from
so
great
an
act
of
violence
then
being
delivered
from
that
fiendish
fury
my
spirits
rose
and
i
said
to
myself
god
but
grant
me
to
execute
my
work
i
hope
by
its
means
to
annihilate
all
my
scoundrelly
enemies
and
thus
i
shall
perform
far
greater
and
more
glorious
revenges
that
if
i
had
vented
my
rage
upon
one
single
having
this
excellent
resolve
in
heart
i
reached
my
home
at
the
end
of
three
days
news
was
brought
me
that
my
only
son
had
been
smothered
by
his
nurse
my
gossip
which
gave
me
greater
grief
than
i
have
ever
had
in
my
whole
life
however
i
knelt
upon
the
ground
and
not
without
tears
returned
thanks
to
god
as
i
was
wont
exclaiming
thou
gavest
me
the
child
and
thou
hast
taken
him
for
all
thy
dealings
i
thank
thee
with
my
whole
this
great
sorrow
went
nigh
to
depriving
me
of
reason
yet
according
to
my
habit
i
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
adapted
myself
to
circumstances
as
well
as
i
was
able
lxvii
about
this
time
a
young
fellow
called
francesco
the
son
of
a
smith
matteo
left
employment
and
inquired
whether
i
would
give
him
work
i
agreed
and
sent
him
to
retouch
my
medusa
which
had
been
new
cast
in
bronze
after
a
fortnight
he
mentioned
that
he
had
been
speaking
with
his
master
that
is
bandinello
who
told
him
if
i
cared
to
make
a
marble
statue
he
would
give
me
a
fine
block
of
stone
i
replied
at
once
him
i
accept
his
offer
perhaps
this
marble
will
prove
a
stumbling
block
to
him
for
he
keeps
on
provoking
me
and
does
not
bear
in
mind
the
great
peril
he
ran
upon
the
piazza
of
san
domenico
tell
him
i
will
have
the
marble
by
all
means
i
never
speak
about
him
and
the
beast
is
perpetually
causing
me
annoyance
i
verily
believe
you
came
to
work
here
at
his
orders
for
the
mere
purpose
of
spying
upon
me
go
then
and
tell
him
i
insist
on
having
the
marble
even
against
his
will
see
that
you
do
not
come
back
without
lxviii
many
days
had
elapsed
during
which
i
had
not
shown
my
face
in
the
palace
when
the
fancy
took
me
to
go
there
one
morning
just
as
the
duke
was
finishing
his
dinner
from
what
i
heard
his
excellency
had
been
talking
of
me
that
morning
commending
me
highly
and
in
particular
praising
my
skill
in
setting
jewels
therefore
when
the
duchess
saw
me
she
called
for
me
by
messer
sforza
and
on
my
presenting
myself
to
her
most
illustrious
excellency
she
asked
me
to
set
a
little
in
a
ring
saying
she
wished
always
to
wear
it
at
the
same
time
she
gave
me
the
measure
and
the
stone
which
was
worth
about
a
hundred
crowns
begging
me
to
be
quick
about
the
work
upon
this
the
duke
began
speaking
to
the
duchess
and
said
is
no
doubt
that
benvenuto
was
formerly
without
his
peer
in
this
art
but
now
that
he
has
abandoned
it
i
believe
it
will
be
too
much
trouble
for
him
to
make
a
little
ring
of
the
sort
you
want
i
pray
you
therefore
not
to
importune
him
about
this
trifle
which
would
be
no
trifle
to
him
owing
to
his
want
of
i
thanked
the
duke
for
his
kind
words
but
begged
him
to
let
me
render
this
trifling
service
to
the
duchess
then
i
took
the
ring
in
hand
and
finished
it
within
a
few
days
it
was
meant
for
the
little
finger
accordingly
i
fashioned
four
tiny
children
in
the
round
and
four
masks
which
figures
composed
the
hoop
i
also
found
room
for
some
enamelled
fruits
and
connecting
links
so
that
the
stone
and
setting
went
uncommonly
well
together
then
i
took
it
to
the
duchess
who
told
me
graciously
that
i
had
produced
a
very
fine
piece
and
that
she
would
remember
me
she
afterwards
sent
the
ring
as
a
present
to
king
philip
and
from
that
time
forward
kept
charging
me
with
commissions
so
kindly
however
that
i
did
my
best
to
serve
her
although
i
saw
but
very
little
of
her
money
god
knows
i
had
great
need
of
that
for
i
was
eager
to
finish
my
perseus
and
had
engaged
some
journeymen
whom
i
paid
out
of
my
own
purse
i
now
began
to
show
myself
more
often
than
i
had
recently
been
doing
note
sforza
almeni
a
perugian
gentleman
the
chamberlain
cosimo
killed
this
man
with
his
own
hand
in
the
year
lxix
it
happened
on
one
that
i
went
to
the
palace
after
dinner
and
when
i
reached
the
clockroom
i
saw
the
door
of
the
wardrobe
standing
open
as
i
drew
nigh
it
the
duke
called
me
and
after
a
friendly
greeting
said
are
welcome
look
at
that
box
which
has
been
sent
me
by
my
lord
stefano
of
palestrina
open
it
and
let
us
see
what
it
when
i
had
opened
the
box
i
cried
to
the
duke
lord
this
is
a
statue
in
greek
marble
and
it
is
a
miracle
of
beauty
i
must
say
that
i
have
never
seen
a
figure
so
excellently
wrought
and
in
so
fine
a
style
among
all
the
antiques
i
have
inspected
if
your
excellency
permits
i
should
like
to
restore
it
head
and
arms
and
feet
i
will
add
an
eagle
in
order
that
we
may
christen
the
lad
ganymede
it
is
certainly
not
my
business
to
patch
up
statues
that
being
the
trade
of
botchers
who
do
it
in
all
conscience
villainously
ill
yet
the
art
displayed
by
this
great
master
of
antiquity
cries
out
to
me
to
help
the
duke
was
highly
delighted
to
find
the
statue
so
beautiful
and
put
me
a
multitude
of
questions
saying
me
benvenuto
minutely
in
what
consists
the
skill
of
this
old
master
which
so
excites
your
i
then
attempted
as
well
as
i
was
able
to
explain
the
beauty
of
workmanship
the
consummate
science
and
the
rare
manner
displayed
by
the
fragment
i
spoke
long
upon
these
topics
and
with
the
greater
pleasure
because
i
saw
that
his
excellency
was
deeply
interested
note
stefano
colonna
of
the
princely
house
of
palestrina
he
was
a
general
of
considerable
repute
in
the
spanish
french
and
florentine
services
successively
lxx
while
i
was
thus
pleasantly
engaged
in
entertaining
the
duke
a
page
happened
to
leave
the
wardrobe
and
at
the
same
moment
bandinello
entered
when
the
duke
saw
him
his
countenance
contracted
and
he
asked
him
drily
are
you
about
here
bandinello
without
answering
cast
a
glance
upon
the
box
where
the
statue
lay
uncovered
then
breaking
into
one
of
his
malignant
laughs
and
wagging
his
head
he
turned
to
the
duke
and
said
lord
this
exactly
illustrates
the
truth
of
what
i
have
so
often
told
your
excellency
you
must
know
that
the
ancients
were
wholly
ignorant
of
anatomy
and
therefore
their
works
abound
in
i
kept
silence
and
paid
no
heed
to
what
he
was
saying
nay
indeed
i
had
turned
my
back
on
him
but
when
the
brute
had
brought
his
disagreeable
babble
to
an
end
the
duke
exclaimed
benvenuto
this
is
the
exact
opposite
of
what
you
were
just
now
demonstrating
with
so
many
excellent
arguments
come
and
speak
a
word
in
defence
of
the
in
reply
to
this
appeal
so
kindly
made
me
by
the
duke
i
spoke
as
follows
lord
your
most
illustrious
excellency
must
please
to
know
that
baccio
bandinello
is
made
up
of
everything
bad
and
thus
has
he
ever
been
therefore
whatever
he
looks
at
be
the
thing
superlatively
excellent
becomes
in
his
ungracious
eyes
as
bad
as
can
be
i
who
incline
to
the
good
only
discern
the
truth
with
purer
sense
consequently
what
i
told
your
excellency
about
this
lovely
statue
is
mere
simple
truth
whereas
what
bandinello
said
is
but
a
portion
of
the
evil
out
of
which
he
is
the
duke
listened
with
much
amusement
but
bandinello
writhed
and
made
the
most
ugly
faces
his
face
itself
being
by
nature
hideous
beyond
measure
which
could
be
imagined
by
the
mind
of
man
the
duke
at
this
point
moved
away
and
proceeded
through
some
ground
floor
rooms
while
bandinello
followed
the
chamberlains
twitched
me
by
the
mantle
and
sent
me
after
so
we
all
attended
the
duke
until
he
reached
a
certain
chamber
where
he
seated
himself
with
bandinello
and
me
standing
at
his
right
hand
and
his
left
i
kept
silence
and
the
gentlemen
of
his
suite
looked
hard
at
bandinello
tittering
among
themselves
about
the
speech
i
had
made
in
the
room
above
so
then
bandinello
began
again
to
chatter
and
cried
out
when
i
uncovered
my
hercules
and
cacus
i
verily
believe
a
hundred
sonnets
were
written
on
me
full
of
the
worst
abuse
which
could
be
invented
by
the
ignorant
i
rejoined
when
michel
agnolo
buonarroti
displayed
his
sacristy
to
view
with
so
many
fine
statues
in
it
the
men
of
talent
in
our
admirable
school
of
florence
always
appreciative
of
truth
and
goodness
published
more
than
a
hundred
sonnets
each
vying
with
his
neighbour
to
extol
these
masterpieces
to
the
skies
so
then
just
as
work
deserved
all
the
evil
which
he
tells
us
was
then
said
about
it
deserved
the
enthusiastic
praise
which
was
bestowed
upon
these
words
of
mine
made
bandinello
burst
with
fury
he
turned
on
me
and
cried
you
what
have
you
got
to
say
against
my
work
will
tell
you
if
you
have
the
patience
to
hear
me
along
then
he
replied
the
duke
and
his
attendants
prepared
themselves
to
listen
i
began
and
opened
by
oration
thus
must
know
that
it
pains
me
to
point
out
the
faults
of
your
statue
i
shall
not
however
utter
my
own
sentiments
but
shall
recapitulate
what
our
most
virtuous
school
of
florence
says
about
the
brutal
fellow
kept
making
disagreeable
remarks
and
gesticulating
with
his
hands
and
feet
until
he
enraged
me
so
that
i
began
again
and
spoke
far
more
rudely
than
i
should
otherwise
have
done
if
he
had
behaved
with
decency
then
this
virtuous
school
says
that
if
one
were
to
shave
the
hair
of
your
hercules
there
would
not
be
skull
enough
left
to
hold
his
brain
it
says
that
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
whether
his
features
are
those
of
a
man
or
of
something
between
a
lion
and
an
ox
the
face
too
is
turned
away
from
the
action
of
the
figure
and
is
so
badly
set
upon
the
neck
with
such
poverty
of
art
and
so
ill
a
grace
that
nothing
worse
was
ever
seen
his
sprawling
shoulders
are
like
the
two
pommels
of
an
his
breasts
and
all
the
muscles
of
the
body
are
not
portrayed
from
a
man
but
from
a
big
sack
full
of
melons
set
upright
against
a
wall
the
loins
seem
to
be
modelled
from
a
bag
of
lanky
pumpkins
nobody
can
tell
how
his
two
legs
are
attached
to
that
vile
trunk
it
is
impossible
to
say
on
which
leg
he
stands
or
which
he
uses
to
exert
his
strength
nor
does
he
seem
to
be
resting
upon
both
as
sculptors
who
know
something
of
their
art
have
occasionally
set
the
figure
it
is
obvious
that
the
body
is
leaning
forward
more
than
of
a
cubit
which
alone
is
the
greatest
and
most
insupportable
fault
committed
by
vulgar
commonplace
pretenders
concerning
the
arms
they
say
that
these
are
both
stretched
out
without
one
touch
of
grace
or
one
real
spark
of
artistic
talents
just
as
if
you
had
never
seen
a
naked
model
again
the
right
leg
of
hercules
and
that
of
cacus
have
got
one
mass
of
flesh
between
them
so
that
if
they
were
to
be
separated
not
only
one
of
them
but
both
together
would
be
left
without
a
calf
at
the
point
where
they
are
touching
they
say
too
that
hercules
has
one
of
his
feet
underground
while
the
other
seems
to
be
resting
on
hot
note
vasari
confirms
this
statement
the
statue
which
may
still
be
seen
upon
the
great
piazza
is
in
truth
a
very
poor
performance
the
florentines
were
angry
because
bandinello
had
filched
the
commission
away
from
michel
angelo
it
was
uncovered
in
and
duke
alessandro
had
to
imprison
its
lampooners
note
cellini
alludes
of
course
to
the
sacristy
of
lorenzo
designed
by
michel
angelo
with
the
portraits
of
the
medici
and
statues
of
day
night
dawn
and
twilight
lxxi
the
fellow
could
not
stand
quiet
to
hear
the
damning
errors
of
his
cacus
in
their
turn
enumerated
for
one
thing
i
was
telling
the
truth
for
another
i
was
unmasking
him
to
the
duke
and
all
the
people
present
who
showed
by
face
and
gesture
first
their
surprise
and
next
their
conviction
that
what
i
said
was
true
all
at
once
he
burst
out
you
slanderous
tongue
why
you
speak
about
my
design
i
retorted
good
draughtsman
can
never
produce
bad
works
therefore
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
your
drawing
is
no
better
than
your
when
he
saw
the
amused
expression
on
the
face
and
the
cutting
gestures
of
the
bystanders
he
let
his
insolence
get
the
better
of
him
and
turned
to
me
with
that
most
hideous
face
of
his
screaming
aloud
hold
your
tongue
you
ugly
hellip
at
these
words
the
duke
frowned
and
the
others
pursed
their
lips
up
and
looked
with
knitted
grows
toward
him
the
horrible
affront
half
maddened
me
with
fury
but
in
a
moment
i
recovered
presence
of
mind
enough
to
turn
it
off
with
a
jest
madman
you
exceed
the
bounds
of
decency
yet
would
to
god
that
i
understood
so
noble
an
art
as
you
allude
to
they
say
that
jove
used
it
with
ganymede
in
paradise
and
here
upon
this
earth
it
is
practised
by
some
of
the
greatest
emperors
and
kings
i
however
am
but
a
poor
humble
creature
who
neither
have
the
power
nor
the
intelligence
to
perplex
my
wits
with
anything
so
when
i
had
finished
this
speech
the
duke
and
his
attendants
could
control
themselves
no
longer
but
broke
into
such
shouts
of
laughter
that
one
never
heard
the
like
you
must
know
gentle
readers
that
though
i
put
on
this
appearance
of
pleasantry
my
heart
was
bursting
in
my
body
to
think
that
a
fellow
the
foulest
villain
who
ever
breathed
should
have
dared
in
the
presence
of
so
great
a
prince
to
cast
an
insult
of
that
atrocious
nature
in
my
teeth
but
you
must
also
know
that
he
insulted
the
duke
and
not
me
for
had
i
not
stood
in
that
august
presence
i
should
have
felled
him
dead
to
earth
when
the
dirty
stupid
scoundrel
observed
that
those
gentlemen
kept
on
laughing
he
tried
to
change
the
subject
and
divert
them
from
deriding
him
so
he
began
as
follows
fellow
benvenuto
goes
about
boasting
that
i
have
promised
him
a
piece
of
i
took
him
up
at
once
did
you
not
send
to
tell
me
by
your
journeyman
francesco
that
if
i
wished
to
work
in
marble
you
would
give
me
a
block
i
accepted
it
and
mean
to
have
he
retorted
very
well
assured
that
you
will
never
get
still
smarting
as
i
was
under
the
calumnious
insults
he
had
flung
at
me
i
lost
my
forgot
i
was
in
the
presence
of
the
duke
and
called
out
in
a
storm
of
fury
swear
to
you
that
if
you
do
not
send
the
marble
to
my
house
you
had
better
look
out
for
another
world
for
if
you
stay
upon
this
earth
i
will
most
certainly
rip
the
wind
out
of
your
carcass
then
suddenly
awaking
to
the
fact
that
i
was
standing
in
the
presence
of
so
great
a
duke
i
turned
submissively
to
his
excellency
and
said
lord
one
fool
makes
a
hundred
the
follies
of
this
man
have
blinded
me
for
a
moment
to
the
glory
of
your
most
illustrious
excellency
and
to
myself
i
humbly
crave
your
then
the
duke
said
to
bandinello
it
true
that
you
promised
him
the
marble
he
replied
that
it
was
true
upon
this
the
duke
addressed
me
to
the
opera
and
choose
a
piece
according
to
your
i
demurred
that
the
man
had
promised
to
sent
it
home
to
me
the
words
that
passed
between
us
were
awful
and
i
refused
to
take
the
stone
in
any
other
way
next
morning
a
piece
of
marble
was
brought
to
my
house
on
asking
who
had
sent
it
they
told
me
it
was
bandinello
and
that
this
was
the
very
block
which
he
had
promised
note
sta
cheto
soddomitaccio
note
questo
sgonfieró
a
ogni
modo
note
vasari
in
his
of
bandinello
gives
a
curious
confirmation
of
veracity
by
reporting
this
quarrel
with
some
of
the
speeches
which
pdssed
between
the
two
rival
artists
yet
he
had
not
read
and
was
far
from
partial
to
the
man
comparing
with
account
we
only
notice
that
the
latter
has
made
bandinello
play
a
less
witty
part
in
the
wordy
strife
than
the
former
assigned
him
lxxii
i
had
it
brought
at
once
in
to
my
studio
and
began
to
chisel
it
while
i
was
the
block
i
made
a
model
but
my
eagerness
to
work
in
marble
was
so
strong
that
i
had
not
patience
to
finish
the
model
as
correctly
as
this
art
demands
i
soon
noticed
that
the
stone
rang
false
beneath
my
strokes
which
made
me
repent
commencing
on
it
yet
i
got
what
i
could
out
of
the
piece
that
is
the
apollo
and
hyacinth
which
may
still
be
seen
unfinished
in
my
workshop
while
i
was
thus
engaged
the
duke
came
to
my
house
and
often
said
to
me
your
bronze
awhile
and
let
me
watch
you
working
on
the
then
i
took
chisel
and
mallet
and
went
at
it
blithely
he
asked
about
the
model
i
had
made
for
my
statue
to
which
i
answered
this
marble
is
all
cracked
but
i
shall
carve
something
from
it
in
spite
of
that
therefore
i
have
not
been
able
to
settle
the
model
but
shall
go
on
doing
the
best
i
his
excellency
sent
to
rome
for
a
block
of
greek
marble
in
order
that
i
might
restore
his
antique
ganymede
which
was
the
cause
of
that
dispute
with
bandinello
when
it
arrived
i
thought
it
a
sin
to
cut
it
up
for
the
head
and
arms
and
other
bits
wanting
in
the
ganymede
so
i
provided
myself
with
another
piece
of
stone
and
reserved
the
greek
marble
for
a
narcissus
which
i
modelled
on
a
small
scale
in
wax
i
found
that
the
block
had
two
holes
penetrating
to
the
depth
of
a
quarter
of
a
cubit
and
two
good
inches
wide
this
led
me
to
choose
the
attitude
which
may
be
noticed
in
my
statue
avoiding
the
holes
and
keeping
my
figure
free
from
them
but
rain
had
fallen
scores
of
years
upon
the
stone
filtering
so
deeply
from
the
holes
into
its
substance
that
the
marble
was
decayed
of
this
i
had
full
proof
at
the
time
of
a
great
inundation
of
the
arno
when
the
river
rose
to
the
height
of
more
than
a
cubit
and
a
half
in
my
workshop
now
the
narcissus
stood
upon
a
square
of
wood
and
the
water
overturned
it
causing
the
statue
to
break
in
two
above
the
breasts
i
had
to
join
the
pieces
and
in
order
that
the
line
of
breakage
might
not
be
observed
i
wreathed
that
garland
of
flowers
round
it
which
may
still
be
seen
upon
the
bosom
i
went
on
working
at
the
surface
employing
some
hours
before
sunrise
or
now
and
then
on
so
as
not
to
lose
the
time
i
needed
for
my
perseus
it
so
happened
on
one
of
those
mornings
while
i
was
getting
some
little
chisels
into
trim
to
work
on
the
narcissus
that
a
very
fine
splinter
of
steel
flew
into
my
right
eye
and
embedded
itself
so
deeply
in
the
pupil
that
it
could
not
be
extracted
i
thought
for
certain
i
must
lose
the
sight
of
that
eye
after
some
days
i
sent
for
maestro
raffaello
dé
pilli
the
surgeon
who
obtained
a
couple
of
live
pigeons
and
placing
me
upon
my
back
across
a
table
took
the
birds
and
opened
a
large
vein
they
have
beneath
the
wing
so
that
the
blood
gushed
out
into
my
eye
i
felt
immediately
relieved
and
in
the
space
of
two
days
the
splinter
came
away
and
i
remained
with
eyesight
greatly
improved
against
the
feast
of
lucia
which
came
round
in
three
days
i
made
a
golden
eye
out
of
a
french
crown
and
had
it
presented
at
her
shrine
by
one
of
my
six
nieces
daughters
of
my
sister
liperata
the
girl
was
ten
years
of
age
and
in
her
company
i
returned
thanks
to
god
and
lucia
for
some
while
afterwards
i
did
not
work
at
the
narcissus
but
pushed
my
perseus
forward
under
all
the
difficulties
i
have
described
it
was
my
purpose
to
finish
it
and
then
to
bid
farewell
to
florence
note
cellini
alludes
to
a
celebrated
inundation
of
the
year
note
lucy
i
need
hardly
remark
is
the
patroness
of
the
eyes
in
italian
art
she
is
generally
represented
holding
her
own
eyes
upon
a
plate
lxxiii
having
succeeded
so
well
with
the
cast
of
the
medusa
i
had
great
hope
of
bringing
my
perseus
through
for
i
had
laid
the
wax
on
and
felt
confident
that
it
would
come
out
in
bronze
as
perfectly
as
the
medusa
the
waxen
model
produced
so
fine
an
effect
that
when
the
duke
saw
it
and
was
struck
with
its
beauty
whether
somebody
had
persuaded
him
it
could
not
be
carried
out
with
the
same
finish
in
metal
or
whether
he
thought
so
for
himself
he
came
to
visit
me
more
frequently
than
usual
and
on
one
occasion
said
this
figure
can
not
succeed
in
bronze
the
laws
of
art
do
not
admit
of
these
words
of
his
excellency
stung
me
so
sharply
that
i
answered
lord
i
know
how
very
little
confidence
you
have
in
me
and
i
believe
the
reason
of
this
is
that
your
most
illustrious
excellency
lends
too
ready
an
ear
to
my
calumniators
or
else
indeed
that
you
do
not
understand
my
he
hardly
let
me
close
the
sentence
when
he
broke
in
profess
myself
a
connoisseur
and
understand
it
very
well
i
replied
like
a
prince
not
like
an
artist
for
if
your
excellency
understood
my
trade
as
well
as
you
imagine
you
would
trust
me
on
the
proofs
i
have
already
given
these
are
first
the
colossal
bronze
bust
of
your
excellency
which
is
now
in
elba
secondly
the
restoration
of
the
ganymede
in
marble
which
offered
so
many
difficulties
and
cost
me
so
much
trouble
that
i
would
rather
have
made
the
whole
statue
new
from
the
beginning
thirdly
the
medusa
cast
by
me
in
bronze
here
now
before
your
eyes
the
execution
of
which
was
a
greater
triumph
of
strength
and
skill
than
any
of
my
predecessors
in
this
fiendish
art
have
yet
achieved
look
you
my
lord
i
constructed
that
furnace
anew
on
principles
quite
different
from
those
of
other
founders
in
addition
to
many
technical
improvements
and
ingenious
devices
i
supplied
it
with
two
issues
for
the
metal
because
this
difficult
and
twisted
figure
could
not
otherwise
have
come
out
perfect
it
is
only
owing
to
my
intelligent
insight
into
means
and
appliances
that
the
statue
turned
out
as
it
did
a
triumph
judged
impossible
by
all
the
practitioners
of
this
art
i
should
like
you
furthermore
to
be
aware
my
lord
for
certain
that
the
sole
reason
why
i
succeeded
with
all
those
great
arduous
works
in
france
under
his
most
admirable
majesty
king
francis
was
the
high
courage
which
that
good
monarch
put
into
my
heart
by
the
liberal
allowances
he
made
me
and
the
multitude
of
workpeople
he
left
at
my
disposal
i
could
have
as
many
as
i
asked
for
and
employed
at
times
above
forty
all
chosen
by
myself
these
were
the
causes
of
my
having
there
produced
so
many
masterpieces
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
now
then
my
lord
put
trust
in
me
supply
me
with
the
aid
i
need
i
am
confident
of
being
able
to
complete
a
work
which
will
delight
your
soul
but
if
your
excellency
goes
on
disheartening
me
and
does
not
advance
me
the
assistance
which
is
absolutely
required
neither
i
nor
any
man
alive
upon
this
earth
can
hope
to
achieve
the
slightest
thing
of
note
at
portoferraio
it
came
afterwards
to
florence
lxxiv
it
was
as
much
as
the
duke
could
do
to
stand
by
and
listen
to
my
pleadings
he
kept
turning
first
this
way
and
then
that
while
i
in
despair
poor
wretched
i
was
calling
up
remembrance
of
the
noble
state
i
held
in
france
to
the
great
sorrow
of
my
soul
all
at
once
he
cried
tell
me
benvenuto
how
is
it
possible
that
yonder
splendid
head
of
medusa
so
high
up
there
in
the
grasp
of
perseus
should
ever
come
out
perfect
i
replied
upon
the
instant
you
now
my
lord
if
your
excellency
possessed
that
knowledge
of
the
craft
which
you
affirm
you
have
you
would
not
fear
one
moment
for
the
splendid
head
you
speak
of
there
is
good
reason
on
the
other
hand
to
feel
uneasy
about
this
right
foot
so
far
below
and
at
a
distance
from
the
when
he
heard
these
words
the
duke
turned
half
in
anger
to
some
gentlemen
in
waiting
and
exclaimed
verily
believe
that
this
benvenuto
prides
himself
on
contradicting
everything
one
then
he
faced
round
to
me
with
a
touch
of
mockery
upon
which
his
attendants
did
the
like
and
began
to
speak
as
follows
will
listen
patiently
to
any
argument
you
can
possibly
produce
in
explanation
of
your
statement
which
may
convince
me
of
its
i
said
in
answer
will
adduce
so
sound
an
argument
that
your
excellency
shall
perceive
the
full
force
of
so
i
began
must
know
my
lord
that
the
nature
of
fire
is
to
ascend
and
therefore
i
promise
you
that
head
will
come
out
famously
but
since
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
fire
to
descend
and
i
must
force
it
downwards
six
cubits
by
artificial
means
i
assure
your
excellency
upon
this
most
convincing
ground
of
proof
that
the
foot
can
not
possibly
come
out
it
will
however
be
quite
easy
for
me
to
restore
then
said
the
duke
you
not
devise
it
so
that
the
foot
should
come
out
as
well
as
you
affirm
the
head
will
i
answered
must
have
made
a
much
larger
furnace
with
a
conduit
as
thick
as
my
leg
and
so
i
might
have
forced
the
molten
metal
by
its
own
weight
to
descend
so
far
now
my
pipe
which
runs
six
cubits
to
the
foot
as
i
have
said
is
not
thicker
than
two
fingers
however
it
was
not
worth
the
trouble
and
expense
to
make
a
larger
for
i
shall
easily
be
able
to
mend
what
is
lacking
but
when
my
mould
is
more
than
half
full
as
i
expect
from
this
middle
point
upwards
the
fire
ascending
by
its
natural
property
then
the
heads
of
perseus
and
medusa
will
come
out
admirably
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
after
i
had
thus
expounded
these
convincing
arguments
together
with
many
more
of
the
same
kind
which
it
would
be
tedious
to
set
down
here
the
duke
shook
his
head
and
departed
without
further
ceremony
lxxv
abandoned
thus
to
my
own
resources
i
took
new
courage
and
banished
the
sad
thoughts
which
kept
recurring
to
my
mind
making
me
often
weep
bitter
tears
of
repentance
for
having
left
france
for
though
i
did
so
only
to
revisit
florence
my
sweet
birthplace
in
order
that
i
might
charitably
succour
my
six
nieces
this
good
action
as
i
well
perceived
had
been
the
beginning
of
my
great
misfortune
nevertheless
i
felt
convinced
that
when
my
perseus
was
accomplished
all
these
trials
would
be
turned
to
high
felicity
and
glorious
accordingly
i
strengthened
my
heart
and
with
all
the
forces
of
my
body
and
my
purse
employing
what
little
money
still
remained
to
me
i
set
to
work
first
i
provided
myself
with
several
loads
of
pinewood
from
the
forests
of
serristori
in
the
neighbourhood
of
montelupo
while
these
were
on
their
way
i
clothed
my
perseus
with
the
clay
which
i
had
prepared
many
months
beforehand
in
order
that
it
might
be
duly
seasoned
after
making
its
clay
tunic
for
that
is
the
term
used
in
this
art
and
properly
arming
it
and
fencing
it
with
iron
girders
i
began
to
draw
the
wax
out
by
means
of
a
slow
fire
this
melted
and
issued
through
numerous
i
had
made
for
the
more
there
are
of
these
the
better
will
the
mould
fill
when
i
had
finished
drawing
off
the
wax
i
constructed
a
furnace
all
round
the
model
of
my
perseus
it
was
built
of
bricks
so
interlaced
the
one
above
the
other
that
numerous
apertures
were
left
for
the
fire
to
exhale
at
then
i
began
to
lay
on
wood
by
degrees
and
kept
it
burning
two
whole
days
and
nights
at
length
when
all
the
wax
was
gone
and
the
mould
was
well
baked
i
set
to
work
at
digging
the
pit
in
which
to
sink
it
this
i
performed
with
scrupulous
regard
to
all
the
rules
of
art
when
i
had
finished
that
part
of
my
work
i
raised
the
mould
by
windlasses
and
stout
ropes
to
a
perpendicular
position
and
suspending
it
with
the
greatest
care
one
cubit
above
the
level
of
the
furnace
so
that
it
hung
exactly
above
the
middle
of
the
pit
i
next
lowered
it
gently
down
into
the
very
bottom
of
the
furnace
and
had
it
firmly
placed
with
every
possible
precaution
for
its
safety
when
this
delicate
operation
was
accomplished
i
began
to
bank
it
up
with
the
earth
i
had
excavated
and
ever
as
the
earth
grew
higher
i
introduced
its
proper
which
were
little
tubes
of
earthenware
such
as
folk
use
for
drains
and
purposes
at
length
i
felt
sure
that
it
was
admirably
fixed
and
that
the
of
the
pit
and
the
placing
of
the
had
been
properly
performed
i
also
could
see
that
my
work
people
understood
my
method
which
differed
very
considerably
from
that
of
all
the
other
masters
in
the
trade
feeling
confident
then
that
i
could
rely
upon
them
i
next
turned
to
my
furnace
which
i
had
filled
with
numerous
pigs
of
copper
and
other
bronze
stuff
the
pieces
were
piled
according
to
the
laws
of
art
that
is
to
say
so
resting
one
upon
the
other
that
the
flames
could
play
freely
through
them
in
order
that
the
metal
might
heat
and
liquefy
the
sooner
at
last
i
called
out
heartily
to
set
the
furnace
going
the
logs
of
pine
were
heaped
in
and
what
with
the
unctuous
resin
of
the
wood
and
the
good
draught
i
had
given
my
furnace
worked
so
well
that
i
was
obliged
to
rush
from
side
to
side
to
keep
it
going
the
labour
was
more
than
i
could
stand
yet
i
forced
myself
to
strain
every
nerve
and
muscle
to
increase
my
anxieties
the
workshop
took
fire
and
we
were
afraid
lest
the
roof
should
fall
upon
our
heads
while
from
the
garden
such
a
storm
of
wind
and
rain
kept
blowing
in
that
it
perceptibly
cooled
the
furnace
battling
thus
with
all
these
untoward
circumstances
for
several
hours
and
exerting
myself
beyond
even
the
measure
of
my
powerful
constitution
i
could
at
last
bear
up
no
longer
and
a
sudden
fever
of
the
utmost
possible
intensity
attacked
me
i
felt
absolutely
obliged
to
go
and
fling
myself
upon
my
bed
sorely
against
my
will
having
to
drag
myself
away
from
the
spot
i
turned
to
my
assistants
about
ten
or
more
in
all
what
with
and
my
own
special
journeymen
among
whom
was
bernardino
mannellini
of
mugello
my
apprentice
through
several
years
to
him
in
particular
i
spoke
my
dear
bernardino
that
you
observe
the
rules
which
i
have
taught
you
do
your
best
with
all
despatch
for
the
metal
will
soon
be
fused
you
can
not
go
wrong
these
honest
men
will
get
the
channels
ready
you
will
easily
be
able
to
drive
back
the
two
plugs
with
this
pair
of
iron
crooks
and
i
am
sure
that
my
mould
will
fill
miraculously
i
feel
more
ill
than
i
ever
did
in
all
my
life
and
verily
believe
that
it
will
kill
me
before
a
few
hours
are
over
thus
with
despair
at
heart
i
left
them
and
betook
myself
to
bed
note
this
furnace
called
was
like
a
so
that
the
mould
could
stand
upright
in
it
as
in
a
cup
the
word
is
the
same
as
our
an
antique
form
of
sleeve
note
these
or
were
introduced
into
the
outer
mould
which
cellini
calls
the
or
clay
tunic
laid
upon
the
original
model
of
baked
clay
and
wax
they
served
the

enter

also

the

the

were
sluices
for
carrying
the
molten
metal
from
the
furnace
into
the
mould
the
which
i
have
translated
by
crooks
were
poles
fitted
at
the
end
with
curved
irons
by
which
the
openings
of
the

in

could
be
partially

driven

as
to
the
molten
metal
flow
through
the

into
the

when
the
metal
reached
the
mould
it
entered
in

which
had
previously

occupied

of

burning
alluded
to
above
i
believe
that
the
process
is
known
as
á

the
or
mould
consisted
of
two
pieces

which
gave
shape
to
the
bronze

solid
and
rounded

which
stood
at

former
and
regulated
the
influx
of
the
metal

above
note
lxxvi
no
sooner
had
i
got
to
bed
than
i
ordered
my
to
carry
food
and
wine
for
all
the
men
into
the
workshop
at
the
same
time
i
cried
shall
not
be
alive
they
tried
to
encourage
me
arguing
that
my
illness
would
pass
over
since
it
came
from
excessive
fatigue
in
this
way
i
spent
two
hours
battling
with
the
fever
which
steadily
increased
and
calling
out
continually
feel
that
i
am
my
housekeeper
who
was
named
mona
fiore
da
castel
del
rio
a
very
notable
manager
and
no
less
kept
chiding
me
for
my
discouragement
but
on
the
other
hand
she
paid
me
every
kind
attention
which
was
possible
however
the
sight
of
my
physical
pain
and
moral
dejection
so
affected
her
that
in
spite
of
that
brave
heart
of
hers
she
could
not
refrain
from
shedding
tears
and
yet
so
far
as
she
was
able
she
took
good
care
i
should
not
see
them
while
i
was
thus
terribly
afflicted
i
beheld
the
figure
of
a
man
enter
my
chamber
twisted
in
his
body
into
the
form
of
a
capital
he
raised
a
lamentable
doleful
voice
like
one
who
announces
their
last
hour
to
men
condemned
to
die
upon
the
scaffold
and
spoke
these
words
benvenuto
your
statue
is
spoiled
and
there
is
no
hope
whatever
of
saving
no
sooner
had
i
heard
the
shriek
of
that
wretch
than
i
gave
a
howl
which
might
have
been
heard
from
the
sphere
of
flame
jumping
from
my
bed
i
seized
my
clothes
and
began
to
dress
the
maids
and
my
lads
and
every
one
who
came
around
to
help
me
got
kicks
or
blows
of
the
fist
while
i
kept
crying
out
in
lamentation
traitors
enviers
this
is
an
act
of
treason
done
by
malice
prepense
but
i
swear
by
god
that
i
will
sift
it
to
the
bottom
and
before
i
die
will
leave
such
witness
to
the
world
of
what
i
can
do
as
shall
make
a
score
of
mortals
when
i
had
got
my
clothes
on
i
strode
with
soul
bent
on
mischief
toward
the
workshop
there
i
beheld
the
men
whom
i
had
left
erewhile
in
such
high
spirits
standing
stupefied
and
downcast
i
began
at
once
and
spoke
with
you
attend
to
me
since
you
have
not
been
able
or
willing
to
obey
the
directions
i
gave
you
obey
me
now
that
i
am
with
you
to
conduct
my
work
in
person
let
no
one
contradict
me
for
in
cases
like
this
we
need
the
aid
of
hand
and
hearing
not
of
when
i
had
uttered
these
words
a
certain
maestro
alessandro
lastricati
broke
silence
and
said
you
benvenuto
you
are
going
to
attempt
an
enterprise
which
the
laws
of
art
do
not
sanction
and
which
can
not
i
turned
upon
him
with
such
fury
and
so
full
of
mischief
that
he
and
all
the
rest
of
them
exclaimed
with
one
voice
then
give
orders
we
will
obey
your
least
commands
so
long
as
life
is
left
in
i
believe
they
spoke
thus
feelingly
because
they
thought
i
must
fall
shortly
dead
upon
the
ground
i
went
immediately
to
inspect
the
furnace
and
found
that
the
metal
was
all
curdled
an
accident
which
we
express
by
i
told
two
of
the
hands
to
cross
the
road
and
fetch
from
the
house
of
the
butcher
capretta
a
load
of
young
which
had
lain
dry
for
above
a
year
this
wood
had
been
previously
offered
me
by
madame
ginevra
wife
of
the
said
capretta
so
soon
as
the
first
armfuls
arrived
i
began
to
fill
the
grate
beneath
the
furnace
now
of
that
kind
heats
more
powerfully
than
any
other
sort
of
tree
and
for
this
reason
where
a
slow
fire
is
wanted
as
in
the
case
of
alder
or
pine
is
preferred
accordingly
when
the
logs
took
fire
oh
how
the
cake
began
to
stir
beneath
that
awful
heat
to
glow
and
sparkle
in
a
blaze
at
the
same
time
i
kept
stirring
up
the
channels
and
sent
men
upon
the
roof
to
stop
the
conflagration
which
had
gathered
force
from
the
increased
combustion
in
the
furnace
also
i
caused
boards
carpets
and
other
hangings
to
be
set
up
against
the
garden
in
order
to
protect
us
from
the
violence
of
the
rain
note

un
migliaccio
note

below

grating
which
receives
the
ashes
from
the
furnace
lxxvii
when
i
had
thus
provided
against
these
several
disasters
i
roared
out
first
to
one
man
and
then
to
another
this
thing
here
take
that
thing
there
at
this
crisis
when
the
whole
gang
saw
the
cake
was
on
the
point
of
melting
they
did
my
bidding
each
fellow
working
with
the
strength
of
three
i
then
ordered
half
a
pig
of
pewter
to
be
brought
which
weighed
about
sixty
pounds
and
flung
it
into
the
middle
of
the
cake
inside
the
furnace
by
this
means
and
by
piling
on
wood
and
stirring
now
with
pokers
and
now
with
iron
rods
the
curdled
mass
rapidly
began
to
liquefy
then
knowing
i
had
brought
the
dead
to
life
again
against
the
firm
opinion
of
those
ignoramuses
i
felt
such
vigour
fill
my
veins
that
all
those
pains
of
fever
all
those
fears
of
death
were
quite
forgotten
all
of
a
sudden
an
explosion
took
place
attended
by
a
tremendous
flash
of
flame
as
though
a
thunderbolt
had
formed
and
been
discharged
amongst
us
unwonted
and
appalling
terror
astonished
every
one
and
me
more
even
than
the
rest
when
the
din
was
over
and
the
dazzling
light
extinguished
we
began
to
look
each
other
in
the
face
then
i
discovered
that
the
cap
of
the
furnace
had
blown
up
and
the
bronze
was
bubbling
over
from
its
source
beneath
so
i
had
the
mouths
of
my
mould
immediately
opened
and
at
the
same
time
drove
in
the
two
plugs
which
kept
back
the
molten
metal
but
i
noticed
that
it
did
not
flow
as
rapidly
as
usual
the
reason
being
probably
that
the
fierce
heat
of
the
fire
we
kindled
had
consumed
its
base
alloy
accordingly
i
sent
for
all
my
pewter
platters
porringers
and
dishes
to
the
number
of
some
two
hundred
pieces
and
had
a
portion
of
them
cast
one
by
one
into
the
channels
the
rest
into
the
furnace
this
expedient
succeeded
and
every
one
could
now
perceive
that
my
bronze
was
in
most
perfect
liquefaction
and
my
mould
was
filling
whereupon
they
all
with
heartiness
and
happy
cheer
assisted
and
obeyed
my
bidding
while
i
now
here
now
there
gave
orders
helped
with
my
own
hands
and
cried
aloud
god
thou
that
by
thy
immeasurable
power
didst
rise
from
the
dead
and
in
thy
glory
didst
ascend
to
heaven
hellip
even
thus
in
a
moment
my
mould
was
filled
and
seeing
my
work
finished
i
fell
upon
my
knees
and
with
all
my
heart
gave
thanks
to
god
after
all
was
over
i
turned
to
a
plate
of
salad
on
a
bench
there
and
ate
with
hearty
appetite
and
drank
together
with
the
whole
crew
afterwards
i
retired
to
bed
healthy
and
happy
for
it
was
now
two
hours
before
morning
and
slept
as
sweetly
as
though
i
had
never
felt
a
touch
of
illness
my
good
housekeeper
without
my
giving
any
orders
had
prepared
a
fat
capon
for
my
repast
so
that
when
i
rose
about
the
hour
for
breaking
fast
she
presented
herself
with
a
smiling
countenance
and
said
is
that
the
man
who
felt
that
he
was
dying
upon
my
word
i
think
the
blows
and
kicks
you
dealt
us
last
night
when
you
were
so
enraged
and
had
that
demon
in
your
body
as
it
seemed
must
have
frightened
away
your
mortal
fever
the
fever
feared
that
it
might
catch
it
too
as
we
did
all
my
poor
household
relieved
in
like
measure
from
anxiety
and
overwhelming
labour
went
at
once
to
buy
earthen
vessels
in
order
to
replace
the
pewter
i
had
cast
away
then
we
dined
together
joyfully
nay
i
can
not
remember
a
day
in
my
whole
life
when
i
dined
with
greater
gladness
or
a
better
appetite
after
our
meal
i
received
visits
from
the
several
men
who
had
assisted
me
they
exchanged
congratulations
and
thanked
god
for
our
success
saying
they
had
learned
and
seen
things
done
which
other
masters
judged
impossible
i
too
grew
somewhat
glorious
and
deeming
i
had
shown
myself
a
man
of
talent
indulged
a
boastful
humour
so
i
thrust
my
hand
into
my
purse
and
paid
them
all
to
their
full
satisfaction
that
evil
fellow
my
mortal
foe
messer
pier
francesco
ricci
majordomo
of
the
duke
took
great
pains
to
find
out
how
the
affair
had
gone
in
answer
to
his
questions
the
two
men
whom
i
suspected
of
having
caked
my
metal
for
me
said
i
was
no
man
but
of
a
certainty
some
powerful
devil
since
i
had
accomplished
what
no
craft
of
the
art
could
do
indeed
they
did
not
believe
a
mere
ordinary
fiend
could
work
such
miracles
as
i
in
other
ways
had
shown
they
exaggerated
the
whole
affair
so
much
possibly
in
order
to
excuse
their
own
part
in
it
that
the
majordomo
wrote
an
account
to
the
duke
who
was
then
in
pisa
far
more
marvellous
and
full
of
thrilling
incidents
than
what
they
had
narrated
lxxviii
after
i
had
let
my
statue
cool
for
two
whole
days
i
began
to
uncover
it
by
slow
degrees
the
first
thing
i
found
was
that
the
head
of
medusa
had
come
out
most
admirably
thanks
to
the
for
as
i
had
told
the
duke
it
is
the
nature
of
fire
to
ascend
upon
advancing
farther
i
discovered
that
the
other
head
that
namely
of
perseus
had
succeeded
no
less
admirably
and
this
astonished
me
far
more
because
it
is
at
a
considerably
lower
level
than
that
of
the
medusa
now
the
mouths
of
the
mould
were
placed
above
the
head
of
perseus
and
behind
his
shoulders
and
i
found
that
all
the
bronze
my
furnace
contained
had
been
exhausted
in
the
head
of
this
figure
it
was
a
miracle
to
observe
that
not
one
fragment
remained
in
the
orifice
of
the
channel
and
that
nothing
was
wanting
to
the
statue
in
my
great
astonishment
i
seemed
to
see
in
this
the
hand
of
god
arranging
and
controlling
all
i
went
on
uncovering
the
statue
with
success
and
ascertained
that
everything
had
come
out
in
perfect
order
until
i
reached
the
foot
of
the
right
leg
on
which
the
statue
rests
there
the
heel
itself
was
formed
and
going
farther
i
found
the
foot
apparently
complete
this
gave
me
great
joy
on
the
one
side
but
was
half
unwelcome
to
me
on
the
other
merely
because
i
had
told
the
duke
that
it
could
not
come
out
however
when
i
reached
the
end
it
appeared
that
the
toes
and
a
little
piece
above
them
were
unfinished
so
that
about
half
the
foot
was
wanting
although
i
knew
that
this
would
add
a
trifle
to
my
labour
i
was
very
well
pleased
because
i
could
now
prove
to
the
duke
how
well
i
understood
my
business
it
is
true
that
far
more
of
the
foot
than
i
expected
had
been
perfectly
formed
the
reason
of
this
was
that
from
causes
i
have
recently
described
the
bronze
was
hotter
than
our
rules
of
art
prescribe
also
that
i
had
been
obliged
to
supplement
the
alloy
with
my
pewter
cups
and
platters
which
no
one
else
i
think
had
ever
done
before
having
now
ascertained
how
successfully
my
work
had
been
accomplished
i
lost
no
time
in
hurrying
to
pisa
where
i
found
the
duke
he
gave
me
a
most
gracious
reception
as
did
also
the
duchess
and
although
the
majordomo
had
informed
them
of
the
whole
proceedings
their
excellencies
deemed
my
performance
far
more
stupendous
and
astonishing
when
they
heard
the
tale
from
my
own
mouth
when
i
arrived
at
the
foot
of
perseus
and
said
it
had
not
come
out
perfect
just
as
i
previously
warned
his
excellency
i
saw
an
expression
of
wonder
pass
over
his
face
while
he
related
to
the
duchess
how
i
had
predicted
this
beforehand
observing
the
princes
to
be
so
well
disposed
towards
me
i
begged
leave
from
the
duke
to
go
to
rome
he
granted
it
in
most
obliging
terms
and
bade
me
return
as
soon
as
possible
to
complete
his
perseus
giving
me
letters
of
recommendation
meanwhile
to
his
ambassador
averardo
serristori
we
were
then
in
the
first
years
of
pope
giulio
de
monti
note
gio
maria
del
monte
sansovino
was
elected
pope
with
the
title
of
julius
in
february
lxxix
before
leaving
home
i
directed
my
workpeople
to
proceed
according
to
the
method
i
had
taught
them
the
reason
of
my
journey
was
as
follows
i
had
made
a
bust
in
bronze
of
bindo
altoviti
the
son
of
antonio
and
had
sent
it
to
him
at
rome
he
set
it
up
in
his
study
which
was
very
richly
adorned
with
antiquities
and
other
works
of
art
but
the
room
was
not
designed
for
statues
or
for
paintings
since
the
windows
were
too
low
so
that
the
light
coming
from
beneath
spoiled
the
effect
they
would
have
produced
under
more
favourable
conditions
it
happened
one
day
that
bindo
was
standing
at
his
door
when
michel
agnolo
buonarroti
the
sculptor
passed
by
so
he
begged
him
to
come
in
and
see
his
study
michel
agnolo
followed
and
on
entering
the
room
and
looking
round
he
exclaimed
is
the
master
who
made
that
good
portrait
of
you
in
so
fine
a
manner
you
must
know
that
that
bust
pleases
me
as
much
or
even
more
than
those
antiques
and
yet
there
are
many
fine
things
to
be
seen
among
the
latter
if
those
windows
were
above
instead
of
beneath
the
whole
collection
would
show
to
greater
advantage
and
your
portrait
placed
among
so
many
masterpieces
would
hold
its
own
with
no
sooner
had
michel
agnolo
left
the
house
of
bindo
than
he
wrote
me
a
very
kind
letter
which
ran
as
follows
dear
benvenuto
i
have
known
you
for
many
years
as
the
greatest
goldsmith
of
whom
we
have
any
information
and
henceforward
i
shall
know
you
for
a
sculptor
of
like
quality
i
must
tell
you
that
master
bindo
altoviti
took
me
to
see
his
bust
in
bronze
and
informed
me
that
you
had
made
it
i
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
work
but
it
annoyed
me
to
notice
that
it
was
placed
in
a
bad
light
for
if
it
were
suitably
illuminated
it
would
show
itself
to
be
the
fine
performance
that
it
this
letter
abounded
with
the
most
affectionate
and
complimentary
expressions
towards
myself
and
before
i
left
for
rome
i
showed
it
to
the
duke
who
read
it
with
much
kindly
interest
and
said
to
me
if
you
write
to
him
and
can
persuade
him
to
return
to
florence
i
will
make
him
a
member
of
the
accordingly
i
wrote
a
letter
full
of
warmth
and
offered
in
the
name
a
hundred
times
more
than
my
commission
carried
but
not
wanting
to
make
any
mistake
i
showed
this
to
the
duke
before
i
sealed
it
saying
to
his
most
illustrious
excellency
perhaps
i
have
made
him
too
many
he
replied
agnolo
deserves
more
than
you
have
promised
and
i
will
bestow
on
him
still
greater
to
this
letter
he
sent
no
answer
and
i
could
see
that
the
duke
was
much
offended
with
him
note
this
man
was
a
member
of
a
very
noble
florentine
family
born
in
he
was
at
this
epoch
tuscan
consul
in
rome
bust
of
him
still
exists
in
the
palazzo
altoviti
at
rome
note
this
was
one
of
the
three
councils
created
by
clement
vii
in
when
he
changed
the
florentine
constitution
it
corresponded
to
a
senate
lxxx
when
i
reached
rome
i
went
to
lodge
in
bindo
house
he
told
me
at
once
how
he
had
shown
his
bronze
bust
to
michel
agnolo
and
how
the
latter
had
praised
it
so
we
spoke
for
some
length
upon
this
topic
i
ought
to
narrate
the
reasons
why
i
had
taken
this
portrait
bindo
had
in
his
hands
golden
crowns
of
mine
which
formed
part
of
he
had
lent
the
duke
were
his
own
and
mine
stood
in
his
name
while
i
received
that
portion
of
the
interest
which
accrued
to
me
this
led
to
my
taking
his
portrait
and
when
he
saw
the
wax
model
for
the
bust
he
sent
me
fifty
golden
scudi
by
a
notary
in
his
employ
named
ser
giuliano
paccalli
i
did
not
want
to
take
the
money
so
i
sent
it
back
to
him
by
the
same
hand
saying
at
a
later
time
to
bindo
shall
be
satisfied
if
you
keep
that
sum
of
mine
for
me
at
interest
so
that
i
may
gain
a
little
on
when
we
came
to
square
accounts
on
this
occasion
i
observed
that
he
was
ill
disposed
towards
me
since
instead
of
treating
me
affectionately
according
to
his
previous
wont
he
put
on
a
stiff
air
and
although
i
was
staying
in
his
house
he
was
never
but
always
surly
however
we
settled
our
business
in
a
few
words
i
sacrificed
my
pay
for
his
portrait
together
with
the
bronze
and
we
arranged
that
he
should
keep
my
money
at
per
cent
during
my
natural
life
note
to
make
the
sum
correct
ought
to
have
been
lent
the
duke
lxxxi
one
of
the
first
things
i
did
was
to
go
and
kiss
the
feet
and
while
i
was
speaking
with
his
holiness
messer
averardo
serristori
our
envoy
arrived
i
had
made
some
proposals
to
the
pope
which
i
think
he
would
have
agreed
upon
and
i
should
have
been
very
glad
to
return
to
rome
on
account
of
the
great
difficulties
which
i
had
at
florence
but
i
soon
perceived
that
the
ambassador
had
countermined
me
then
i
went
to
visit
michel
agnolo
buonarroti
and
repeated
what
i
had
written
from
florence
to
him
in
the
name
he
replied
that
he
was
engaged
upon
the
fabric
of
and
that
this
would
prevent
him
from
leaving
rome
i
rejoined
that
as
he
had
decided
on
the
model
of
that
building
he
could
leave
its
execution
to
his
man
urbino
who
would
carry
out
his
orders
to
the
letter
i
added
much
about
future
favours
in
the
form
of
a
message
from
the
duke
upon
this
he
looked
me
hard
in
the
face
and
said
with
a
sarcastic
smile
you
to
what
extent
are
you
satisfied
with
him
although
i
replied
that
i
was
extremely
contented
and
was
very
well
treated
by
his
excellency
he
showed
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
greater
part
of
my
annoyances
and
gave
as
his
final
answer
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
him
to
leave
rome
to
this
i
added
that
he
could
not
do
better
than
to
return
to
his
own
land
which
was
governed
by
a
prince
renowned
for
justice
and
the
greatest
lover
of
the
arts
and
sciences
who
ever
saw
the
light
of
this
world
as
i
have
remarked
above
he
had
with
him
a
servant
of
his
who
came
from
urbino
and
had
lived
many
years
in
his
employment
rather
as
valet
and
housekeeper
than
anything
else
this
indeed
was
obvious
because
he
had
acquired
no
skill
in
the
arts
consequently
while
i
was
pressing
michel
agnolo
with
arguments
he
could
not
answer
he
turned
round
sharply
to
urbino
as
though
to
ask
him
his
opinion
the
fellow
began
to
bawl
out
in
his
rustic
way
will
never
leave
my
master
michel
side
till
i
shall
have
flayed
him
or
he
shall
have
flayed
these
stupid
words
forced
me
to
laugh
and
without
saying
farewell
i
lowered
my
shoulders
and
retired
note
his
despatches
form
a
valuable
series
of
historical
documents
le
monnier
note
upon
the
death
of
this
urbino
michel
agnolo
wrote
a
touching
sonnet
and
a
very
feeling
letter
to
vasari
lxxxii
the
miserable
bargain
i
had
made
with
bindo
altoviti
losing
my
bust
and
leaving
him
my
capital
for
life
taught
me
what
the
faith
of
merchants
is
so
i
returned
in
bad
spirits
to
florence
i
went
at
once
to
the
palace
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
duke
whom
i
found
to
be
at
castello
beyond
ponte
a
rifredi
in
the
palace
i
met
messer
pier
francesco
ricci
the
majordomo
and
when
i
drew
nigh
to
pay
him
the
usual
compliments
he
exclaimed
with
measureless
astonishment
are
you
come
back
and
with
the
same
air
of
surprise
clapping
his
hands
together
he
cried
duke
is
at
castello
then
turned
his
back
and
left
me
i
could
not
form
the
least
idea
why
the
beast
behaved
in
such
an
extraordinary
manner
to
me
proceeding
at
once
to
castello
and
entering
the
garden
where
the
duke
was
i
caught
sight
of
him
at
a
distance
but
no
sooner
had
he
seen
me
than
he
showed
signs
of
surprise
and
intimated
that
i
might
go
about
my
business
i
had
been
reckoning
that
his
excellency
would
treat
me
with
the
same
kindness
or
even
greater
as
before
i
left
for
rome
so
now
when
he
received
me
with
such
rudeness
i
went
back
much
hurt
to
florence
while
resuming
my
work
and
pushing
my
statue
forward
i
racked
my
brains
to
think
what
could
have
brought
about
this
sudden
change
in
the
manner
the
curious
way
in
which
messer
sforza
and
some
other
gentlemen
close
to
his
person
eyed
me
prompted
me
to
ask
the
former
what
the
matter
was
he
only
replied
with
a
sort
of
smile
do
your
best
to
be
an
honest
man
and
have
no
concern
for
anything
a
few
days
afterwards
i
obtained
an
audience
of
the
duke
who
received
me
with
a
kind
of
grudging
grace
and
asked
me
what
i
had
been
doing
at
rome
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
maintained
the
conversation
and
told
him
the
whole
story
about
bindo
bust
it
was
evident
that
he
listened
with
attention
so
i
went
on
talking
about
michel
agnolo
buonarroti
at
this
he
showed
displeasure
but
stupid
speech
about
the
flaying
made
him
laugh
aloud
then
he
said
it
is
he
who
suffers
and
i
took
my
leave
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
ser
pier
francesco
the
majordomo
must
have
served
me
some
ill
turn
with
the
duke
which
did
not
however
succeed
for
god
who
loves
the
truth
protected
me
as
he
hath
ever
saved
me
from
a
sea
of
dreadful
dangers
and
i
hope
will
save
me
till
the
end
of
this
my
life
however
full
of
trials
it
may
be
i
march
forward
therefore
with
a
good
heart
sustained
alone
by
his
divine
power
nor
let
myself
be
terrified
by
any
furious
assault
of
fortune
or
my
adverse
stars
may
only
god
maintain
me
in
his
grace
lxxxiii
i
must
beg
your
attention
now
most
gracious
reader
for
a
very
terrible
event
which
happened
i
used
the
utmost
diligence
and
industry
to
complete
my
statue
and
went
to
spend
my
evenings
in
the
wardrobe
assisting
there
the
goldsmiths
who
were
working
for
his
excellency
indeed
they
laboured
mainly
on
designs
which
i
had
given
them
noticing
that
the
duke
took
pleasure
in
seeing
me
at
work
and
talking
with
me
i
took
it
into
my
head
to
go
there
sometimes
also
by
day
it
happened
upon
one
of
those
days
that
his
excellency
came
as
usual
to
the
room
where
i
was
occupied
and
more
particularly
because
he
heard
of
my
arrival
his
excellency
entered
at
once
into
conversation
raising
several
interesting
topics
upon
which
i
gave
my
views
so
much
to
his
entertainment
that
he
showed
more
cheerfulness
than
i
had
ever
seen
in
him
before
all
of
a
sudden
one
of
his
secretaries
appeared
and
whispered
something
of
importance
in
his
ear
whereupon
the
duke
rose
and
retired
with
the
official
into
another
chamber
now
the
duchess
had
sent
to
see
what
his
excellency
was
doing
and
her
page
brought
back
this
answer
duke
is
talking
and
laughing
with
benvenuto
and
is
in
excellent
when
the
duchess
heard
this
she
came
immediately
to
the
wardrobe
and
not
finding
the
duke
there
took
a
seat
beside
us
after
watching
us
at
work
a
while
she
turned
to
me
with
the
utmost
graciousness
and
showed
me
a
necklace
of
large
and
really
very
fine
pearls
on
being
asked
by
her
what
i
thought
of
them
i
said
it
was
in
truth
a
very
handsome
ornament
then
she
spoke
as
follows
should
like
the
duke
to
buy
them
for
me
so
i
beg
you
my
dear
benvenuto
to
praise
them
to
him
as
highly
as
you
at
these
words
i
disclosed
my
mind
to
the
duchess
with
all
the
respect
i
could
and
answered
lady
i
thought
this
necklace
of
pearls
belonged
already
to
your
most
illus
trious
excellency
now
that
i
am
aware
you
have
not
yet
acquired
them
it
is
right
nay
more
it
is
my
duty
to
utter
what
i
might
otherwise
have
refrained
from
saying
namely
that
my
mature
professional
experience
enables
me
to
detect
very
grave
faults
in
the
pearls
and
for
this
reason
i
could
never
advise
your
excellency
to
purchase
she
replied
merchant
offers
them
for
six
thousand
crowns
and
were
it
not
for
some
of
those
trifling
defects
you
speak
of
the
rope
would
be
worth
over
twelve
to
this
i
replied
that
were
the
necklace
of
quite
flawless
quality
i
could
not
advise
any
one
to
bid
up
to
five
thousand
crowns
for
it
for
pearls
are
not
gems
pearls
are
but
bones
which
in
the
course
of
time
must
lose
their
freshness
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
and
sapphires
on
the
contrary
never
grow
old
these
four
are
precious
stones
and
these
it
is
quite
right
to
when
i
had
thus
spoken
the
duchess
showed
some
signs
of
irritation
and
exclaimed
have
a
mind
to
possess
these
pearls
so
prithee
take
them
to
the
duke
and
praise
them
up
to
the
skies
even
if
you
have
to
use
some
words
beyond
the
bounds
of
truth
speak
them
to
do
me
service
it
will
be
well
for
you
i
have
always
been
the
greatest
friend
of
truth
and
foe
of
lies
yet
compelled
by
necessity
unwilling
to
lose
the
favour
of
so
great
a
princess
i
took
those
confounded
pearls
sorely
against
my
inclination
and
went
with
them
over
to
the
other
room
whither
the
duke
had
withdrawn
no
sooner
did
he
set
eyes
upon
me
than
he
cried
benvenuto
what
are
you
about
here
i
uncovered
the
pearls
and
said
lord
i
am
come
to
show
you
a
most
splendid
necklace
of
pearls
of
the
rarest
quality
and
truly
worthy
of
your
excellency
i
do
not
believe
it
would
be
possible
to
put
together
eighty
pearls
which
could
show
better
than
these
do
in
a
necklace
my
counsel
therefore
is
that
you
should
buy
them
for
they
are
in
good
sooth
he
responded
on
the
instant
do
not
choose
to
buy
them
they
are
not
pearls
of
the
quality
and
goodness
you
affirm
i
have
seen
the
necklace
and
they
do
not
please
then
i
added
me
prince
these
pearls
exceed
in
rarity
and
beauty
any
which
were
ever
brought
together
for
a
the
duchess
had
risen
and
was
standing
behind
a
door
listening
to
all
i
said
well
when
i
had
praised
the
pearls
a
thousandfold
more
warmly
than
i
have
described
above
the
duke
turned
towards
me
with
a
kindly
look
and
said
my
dear
benvenuto
i
know
that
you
have
an
excellent
judgment
in
these
matters
if
the
pearls
are
as
rare
as
you
certify
i
should
not
hesitate
about
their
purchase
partly
to
gratify
the
duchess
and
partly
to
possess
them
seeing
i
have
always
need
of
such
things
not
so
much
for
her
grace
as
for
the
various
uses
of
my
sons
and
when
i
heard
him
speak
thus
having
once
begun
to
tell
fibs
i
stuck
to
them
with
even
greater
boldness
i
gave
all
the
colour
of
truth
i
could
to
my
lies
confiding
in
the
promise
of
the
duchess
to
help
me
at
the
time
of
need
more
than
two
hundred
crowns
were
to
be
my
commission
on
the
bargain
and
the
duchess
had
intimated
that
i
should
receive
so
much
but
i
was
firmly
resolved
not
to
touch
a
farthing
in
order
to
secure
my
credit
and
convince
the
duke
i
was
not
prompted
by
avarice
once
more
his
excellency
began
to
address
me
with
the
greatest
courtesy
know
that
you
are
consummate
judge
of
these
things
therefore
if
you
are
the
honest
man
i
always
thought
you
tell
me
now
the
thereat
i
flushed
up
to
my
eyes
which
at
the
same
time
filled
with
tears
and
said
to
him
lord
if
i
tell
your
most
illustrious
excellency
the
truth
i
shall
make
a
mortal
foe
of
the
duchess
this
will
oblige
me
to
depart
from
florence
and
my
enemies
will
begin
at
once
to
pour
contempt
upon
my
perseus
which
i
have
announced
as
a
masterpiece
to
the
most
noble
school
of
your
illustrious
excellency
such
being
the
case
i
recommend
myself
to
your
most
illustrious
lxxxiv
the
duke
was
now
aware
that
all
my
previous
speeches
had
been
as
it
were
forced
out
of
me
so
he
rejoined
you
have
confidence
in
me
you
need
not
stand
in
fear
of
anything
i
recommenced
my
lord
what
can
prevent
this
coming
to
the
ears
of
the
duchess
the
duke
lifted
his
hand
in
sign
of
and
exclaimed
assured
that
what
you
say
will
be
buried
in
a
diamond
casket
to
this
engagement
upon
honour
i
replied
by
telling
the
truth
according
to
my
judgment
namely
that
the
pearls
were
not
worth
above
two
thousand
crowns
the
duchess
thinking
we
had
stopped
talking
for
we
now
were
speaking
in
as
low
a
voice
as
possible
came
forward
and
began
as
follows
lord
do
me
the
favour
to
purchase
this
necklace
because
i
have
set
my
heart
on
them
and
your
benvenuto
here
has
said
he
never
saw
a
finer
row
of
the
duke
replied
do
not
choose
to
buy
my
lord
will
not
your
excellency
gratify
me
by
buying
them
i
do
not
care
to
throw
my
money
out
of
the
the
duchess
recommenced
do
you
mean
by
throwing
your
money
away
when
benvenuto
in
whom
you
place
such
confidence
has
told
me
that
they
would
be
cheap
at
over
three
thousand
crowns
then
the
duke
said
lady
my
benvenuto
here
has
told
me
that
if
i
purchase
this
necklace
i
shall
be
throwing
my
money
away
inasmuch
as
the
pearls
are
neither
round
nor
and
some
of
them
are
quite
faded
to
prove
that
this
is
so
look
here
look
there
consider
this
one
and
then
that
the
necklace
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
for
at
these
words
the
duchess
cast
a
glance
of
bitter
spite
at
me
and
retired
with
a
threatening
nod
of
her
head
in
my
direction
i
felt
tempted
to
pack
off
at
once
and
bid
farewell
to
italy
yet
my
perseus
being
all
but
finished
i
did
not
like
to
leave
without
exposing
it
to
public
view
but
i
ask
every
one
to
consider
in
what
a
grievous
plight
i
found
myself
the
duke
had
given
orders
to
his
porters
in
my
presence
that
if
i
appeared
at
the
palace
they
should
always
admit
me
through
his
apartments
to
the
place
where
he
might
happen
to
be
the
duchess
commanded
the
same
men
whenever
i
showed
my
face
at
that
palace
to
drive
me
from
its
gates
accordingly
no
sooner
did
i
present
myself
than
these
fellows
left
their
doors
and
bade
me
begone
at
the
same
time
they
took
good
care
lest
the
duke
should
perceive
what
they
were
after
for
if
he
caught
sight
of
me
before
those
wretches
he
either
called
me
or
beckoned
to
me
to
advance
at
this
juncture
the
duchess
sent
for
bernardone
the
broker
of
whom
she
had
so
often
complained
to
me
abusing
his
and
utter
worthlessness
she
now
confided
in
him
as
she
had
previously
done
in
me
he
replied
princess
leave
the
matter
in
my
then
the
rascal
presented
himself
before
the
duke
with
that
necklace
in
his
hands
no
sooner
did
the
duke
set
eyes
on
him
than
he
bade
him
begone
but
the
rogue
lifted
his
big
ugly
voice
which
sounded
like
the
braying
of
an
ass
through
his
huge
nose
and
spoke
to
this
effect
my
dear
lord
for
sake
buy
this
necklace
for
the
poor
duchess
who
is
dying
to
have
it
and
can
not
indeed
live
without
the
fellow
poured
forth
so
much
of
this
stupid
nonsensical
stuff
that
the
patience
was
exhausted
and
he
cried
get
away
with
you
or
blow
your
chaps
out
till
i
smack
them
the
knave
knew
very
well
what
he
was
after
for
if
by
blowing
out
his
cheeks
or
singing
bella
he
could
bring
the
duke
to
make
that
purchase
then
he
gained
the
good
grace
of
the
duchess
and
to
boot
his
own
commission
which
rose
to
some
hundreds
of
crowns
consequently
he
did
blow
out
his
chaps
the
duke
smacked
them
with
several
hearty
boxes
and
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
struck
rather
harder
than
his
wont
was
the
sound
blows
upon
his
cheeks
not
only
reddened
them
above
their
natural
purple
but
also
brought
tears
into
his
eyes
all
the
same
while
smarting
he
began
to
cry
my
lord
a
faithful
servant
of
his
prince
who
tries
to
act
rightly
and
is
willing
to
put
up
with
any
sort
of
bad
treatment
provided
only
that
poor
lady
have
her
desire
the
duke
tired
of
the
ribald
fellow
either
to
recompense
the
cuffs
which
he
had
dealt
him
or
for
the
sake
whom
he
was
ever
most
inclined
to
gratify
cried
out
away
with
you
with
curse
on
you
go
make
the
bargain
i
am
willing
to
do
what
my
lady
duchess
from
this
incident
we
may
learn
to
know
how
evil
fortune
exerts
her
rage
against
a
poor
man
and
how
the
strumpet
luck
can
help
a
miserable
rascal
i
lost
the
good
graces
of
the
duchess
once
and
for
ever
and
thereby
went
close
to
having
the
protection
taken
from
me
he
acquired
that
thumping
fee
for
his
commission
and
to
boot
their
favour
thus
it
will
not
serve
us
in
this

to
be
merely

to
fortify

distributed

concerned
with
them
the
duke
who
certainly
was
at
all
times
a
man
of
great
ability
went
round
the
city
himself
upon
a
tour
of
inspection
and
when
he
had
made
his
mind
up
he
sent
for
lattanzio
gorini
one
of
his
paymasters
now
this
man
was
to
some
extent
an
amateur
of
military
architecture
so
his
excellency
commissioned
him
to
make
designs
for
the
fortifications
of
the
gates
and
sent
each
of
us
his
own
gate
drawn
according
to
the
plan
after
examining
the
plan
for
mine
and
perceiving
that
it
was
very
incorrect
in
many
details
i
took
it
and
went
immediately
to
the
duke
when
i
tried
to
point
out
these
defects
the
duke
interrupted
me
and
exclaimed
with
fury
i
will
give
way
to
you
upon
the
point
of
statuary
but
in
this
art
of
fortification
i
choose
that
you
should
cede
to
me
so
carry
out
the
design
which
i
have
given
to
these
brave
words
i
answered
as
gently
as
i
could
and
said
lord
your
most
illustrious
excellency
has
taught
me
something
even
in
my
own
fine
art
of
statuary
inasmuch
as
we
have
always
exchanged
ideas
upon
that
subject
i
beg
you
then
to
deign
to
listen
to
me
upon
this
matter
of
your
fortifications
which
is
far
more
important
than
making
statues
if
i
am
permitted
to
discuss
it
also
with
your
excellency
you
will
be
better
able
to
teach
me
how
i
have
to
serve
this
courteous
speech
of
mine
induced
him
to
discuss
the
plans
with
me
and
when
i
had
clearly
demonstrated
that
they
were
not
conceived
on
a
right
method
he
said
then
and
make
a
design
yourself
and
i
will
see
if
it
satisfies
accordingly
i
made
two
designs
according
to
the
right
principles
for
fortifying
those
two
gates
and
took
them
to
him
and
when
he
distinguished
the
true
from
the
false
system
he
exclaimed
good
humouredly
and
do
it
in
your
own
way
for
i
am
content
to
have
it
i
set
to
work

da
san
gallo
lxxxvi
there
was
on
guard
at
the
gate
of
prato
a
certain
lombard
captain
he
was
a
truculent
and
stalwart
fellow
of
incredibly
coarse
speech
whose
presumption
matched
his
utter
ignorance
this
man
began
at
once
to
ask
me
what
i
was
about
there
i
politely
exhibited
my
drawings
and
took
infinite
pains
to
make
him
understand
my
purpose
the
rude
brute
kept
rolling
his
head
and
turning
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
shifting
himself
upon
his
legs
and
twirling
his
enormous
moustachios
then
he
drew
his
cap
down
over
his
eyes
and
roared
out
deuce
take
it
i
can
make
nothing
of
this
at
last
the
animal
became
so
tiresome
that
i
said
it
then
to
me
who
do
understand
it
and
turned
my
shoulders
to
go
about
my
business
at
this
he
began
to
threaten
me
with
his
head
and
setting
his
left
hand
on
the
pommel
of
his
sword
tilted
the
point
up
and
exclaimed
my
master
you
want
perhaps
to
make
me
cross
blades
with
you
i
faced
round
in
great
fury
for
the
man
had
stirred
my
blood
and
cried
out
would
be
less
trouble
to
run
you
through
the
body
than
to
build
the
bastion
of
this
in
an
instant
we
both
set
hands
to
our
swords
without
quite
drawing
for
a
number
of
honest
folk
citizens
of
florence
and
others
of
them
courtiers
came
running
up
the
greater
part
of
them
rated
the
captain
telling
him
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
that
i
was
a
man
to
give
him
back
as
good
as
i
got
and
that
if
this
came
to
the
ears
it
would
be
the
worse
for
him
accordingly
he
went
off
on
his
own
business
and
i
began
with
my
bastion
after
setting
things
in
order
there
i
proceeded
to
the
other
little
gate
of
arno
where
i
found
a
captain
from
cesena
the
most
polite
man
i
ever
knew
in
that
profession
he
had
the
air
of
a
gentle
young
lady
but
at
need
he
could
prove
himself
one
of
the
boldest
and
bloodiest
fighters
in
the
world
this
agreeable
gentleman
observed
me
so
attentively
that
he
made
me
bashful
and
and
seeing
that
he
wanted
to
understand
what
i
was
doing
i
courteously
explained
my
plans
suffice
it
to
say
that
we
vied
with
each
other
in
civilities
which
made
me
do
far
better
with
this
bastion
than
with
the
other
i
had
nearly
finished
the
two
bastions
when
an
inroad
of
piero
people
struck
such
terror
into
the
countryfolk
of
prato
that
they
began
to
leave
it
in
a
body
and
all
their
carts
laden
with
the
household
goods
of
each
family
came
crowding
into
the
city
the
number
of
them
was
so
enormous
cart
jostling
with
cart
and
the
confusion
was
so
great
that
i
told
the
guards
to
look
out
lest
the
same
misadventure
should
happen
at
this
gate
as
had
occurred
at
the
gates
of
turin
for
if
we
had
once
cause
to
lower
the
portcullis
it
would
not
be
able
to
perform
its
functions
but
must
inevitably
stick
suspended
upon
one
of
the
waggons
when
that
big
brute
of
a
captain
heard
these
words
he
replied
with
insults
and
i
retorted
in
the
same
tone
we
were
on
the
point
of
coming
to
a
far
worse
quarrel
than
before
however
the
folk
kept
us
asunder
and
when
i
had
finished
my
bastions
i
touched
some
score
of
crowns
which
i
had
not
expected
and
which
were
uncommonly
welcome
so
i
returned
with
a
blithe
heart
to
finish
my
perseus
lxxxvii
during
those
days
some
antiquities
had
been
discovered
in
the
country
round
arezzo
among
them
was
the
chimćra
that
bronze
lion
which
is
to
be
seen
in
the
rooms
adjacent
to
the
great
hall
of
the
palace
together
with
the
chimćra
a
number
of
little
statuettes
likewise
in
bronze
had
been
brought
to
light
they
were
covered
with
earth
and
rust
and
each
of
them
lacked
either
head
or
hands
or
feet
the
duke
amused
his
leisure
hours
by
cleaning
up
these
statuettes
himself
with
certain
little
chisels
used
by
goldsmiths
it
happened
on
one
occasion
that
i
had
to
speak
on
business
to
his
excellency
and
while
we
were
talking
he
reached
me
a
little
hammer
with
which
i
struck
the
chisels
the
duke
held
and
so
the
figures
were
disengaged
from
their
earth
and
rust
in
this
way
we
passed
several
evenings
and
then
the
duke
commissioned
me
to
restore
the
statuettes
he
took
so
much
pleasure
in
these
trifles
that
he
made
me
work
by
day
also
and
if
i
delayed
coming
he
used
to
send
for
me
i
very
often
submitted
to
his
excellency
that
if
i
left
my
perseus
in
the
daytime
several
bad
consequences
would
ensue
the
first
of
these
which
caused
me
the
greatest
anxiety
was
that
seeing
me
spend
so
long
a
time
upon
my
statue
the
duke
himself
might
get
disgusted
which
indeed
did
afterwards
happen
the
other
was
that
i
had
several
journeymen
who
in
my
absence
were
up
to
two
kinds
of
mischief
first
they
spoilt
my
piece
and
then
they
did
as
little
work
as
possible
these
arguments
made
his
excellency
consent
that
i
should
only
go
to
the
palace
after
i
had
now
conciliated
the
affection
of
his
excellency
to
such
an
extent
that
every
evening
when
i
came
to
him
he
treated
me
with
greater
kindness
about
this
time
the
new
apartments
were
built
toward
the
lions
the
duke
then
wishing
to
be
able
to
retire
into
a
less
public
part
of
the
palace
fitted
up
for
himself
a
little
chamber
in
these
new
lodgings
and
ordered
me
approach
to
it
by
a
private
passage
i
had
to
pass
through
his
wardrobe
then
across
the
stage
of
the
great
hall
and
afterwards
through
certain
little
dark
galleries
and
cabinets
the
duchess
however
after
a
few
days
deprived
me
of
this
means
of
access
by
having
all
the
doors
upon
the
path
i
had
to
traverse
locked
up
the
consequence
was
that
every
evening
when
i
arrived
at
the
palace
i
had
to
wait
a
long
while
because
the
duchess
occupied
the
cabinets
for
her
personal
necessities
her
habit
of
body
was
unhealthy
and
so
i
never
came
without
incommoding
her
this
and
other
causes
made
her
hate
the
very
sight
of
me
however
nothwithstanding
great
discomforts
and
daily
annoyances
i
persevered
in
going
the
orders
meanwhile
were
so
precise
that
no
sooner
did
i
knock
at
those
doors
than
they
were
immediately
opened
and
i
was
allowed
to
pass
freely
where
i
chose
the
consequence
was
that
occasionally
while
walking
noiselessly
and
unexpectedly
through
the
private
rooms
i
came
upon
the
duchess
at
a
highly
inconvenient
moment
bursting
then
into
such
a
furious
storm
of
rage
that
i
was
frightened
she
cried
out
will
you
ever
finish
mending
up
those
statuettes
upon
my
word
this
perpetual
going
and
coming
of
yours
has
grown
to
be
too
great
a
i
replied
as
gently
as
i
could
lady
and
sole
mistress
i
have
no
other
desire
than
to
serve
you
loyally
and
with
the
strictest
obedience
this
work
to
which
the
duke
has
put
me
will
last
several
months
so
tell
me
most
illustrious
excellency
whether
you
wish
me
not
to
come
here
any
more
in
that
case
i
will
not
come
whoever
calls
me
nay
should
the
duke
himself
send
for
me
i
shall
reply
that
i
am
ill
and
by
no
means
will
i
intrude
to
this
speech
she
made
answer
do
not
bid
you
not
to
come
nor
do
i
bid
you
to
disobey
the
duke
but
i
repeat
that
your
work
seems
to
me
as
though
it
would
never
be
whether
the
duke
heard
something
of
this
encounter
or
whatever
the
cause
was
he
began
again
as
usual
toward
he
sent
for
me
and
his
messenger
always
spoke
to
this
effect
good
care
and
do
not
fail
to
come
for
the
duke
is
waiting
for
in
this
way
i
continued
always
with
the
same
inconveniences
to
put
in
an
appearance
on
several
successive
evenings
upon
one
occasion
among
others
arriving
in
my
customary
way
the
duke
who
had
probably
been
talking
with
the
duchess
about
private
matters
turned
upon
me
in
a
furious
anger
i
was
terrified
and
wanted
to
retire
but
he
called
out
in
friend
benvenuto

to
your
affairs
i
will
rejoin
you
in
a
few
while
i
was
passing
onward

then
quite
a
little
fellow
plucked
me
by
the
cape
and
played
with
me
as
prettily
as
such
a
child
could
do
the
duke
looked
up
delighted
and
exclaimed

and
friendly
terms

and
don
giovanni
and
don
arnando
and
don
garzia
kept
always
hovering
around
me
teasing
me
whenever
the
eyes
were
turned
i
begged
them
for
sake
to
hold
their
peace
they
answered
we
can
not
i
told
them
one
can
not
is
required
of
no
one
so
have
your
will
along
with
you
at
this
both
duke
and
duchess
burst
out
laughing
another
evening
after
i
had
finished
the
small
bronze
figures
which
are
wrought
into
the
pedestal
of
perseus
that
is
to
say
the
jupiter
mercury
minerva
and
danć
with
the
little
perseus
seated
at
his
feet
i
had
them
carried
into
the
room
where
i
was
wont
to
work
and
arranged
them
in
a
row
raised
somewhat
above
the
line
of
vision
so
that
they
produced
a
magnificent
effect
the
duke
heard
of
this
and
made
his
entrance
sooner
than
usual
it
seems
that
the
person
who
informed
his
excellency
praised
them
above
their
merit
using
terms
like
superior
to
the
ancients
and
so
forth
wherefore
the
duke
came
talking
pleasantly
with
the
duchess
about
my
doings
i
rose
at
once
and
went
to
meet
them
with
his
fine
and
truly
princely
manner
he
received
me
lifting
his
right
hand
in
which
he
held
as
superb
a
as
could
possibly
be
seen
it
my
benvenuto
he
exclaimed
this
pear
in
your
to
these
words
i
replied
with
a
delighted
gesture
my
lord
does
your
most
illustrious
excellency
really
mean
that
i
should
plant
it
in
the
garden
of
my
house
he
said
the
garden
of
the
house
which
belongs
to
you
have
you
understood
me
i
thanked
his
excellency
and
the
duchess
in
like
manner
with
the
best
politeness
i
could
use
after
this
they
both
took
seats
in
front
of
the
statues
and
for
more
than
two
hours
went
on
talking
about
nothing
but
the
beauties
of
the
work
the
duchess
was
wrought
up
to
such
an
enthusiasm
that
she
cried
out
do
not
like
to
let
those
exquisite
figures
be
wasted
on
the
pedestal
down
there
in
the
piazza
where
they
will
run
the
risk
of
being
injured
i
would
much
rather
have
you
fix
them
in
one
of
my
apartments
where
they
will
be
preserved
with
the
respect
due
to
their
singular
artistic
i
opposed
this
plan
with
many
forcible
arguments
but
when
i
saw
that
she
was
determined
i
should
not
place
them
on
the
pedestal
where
they
now
stand
i
waited
till
next
day
and
went
to
the
palace
about
ascertaining
that
the
duke
and
duchess
were
out
riding
and
having
already
prepared
the
pedestal
i
had
the
statues
carried
down
and
soldered
them
with
lead
into
their
proper
niches
oh
when
the
duchess
knew
of
this
how
angry
she
was
had
it
not
been
for
the
duke
who
manfully
defended
me
i
should
have
paid
dearly
for
my
daring
her
indignation
about
the
pearls
and
now
again
about
this
matter
of
the
statues
made
her
so
contrive
that
the
duke
abandoned
his
amusements
in
our
workshop
consequently
i
went
there
no
more
and
was
met
again
with
the
same
obstructions
as
formerly
whenever
i
wanted
to
gain
access
to
the
palace
note
the
prince
was
don
francesco
then
aged
twelve
don
giovanni
was
ten
don
garzia
was
six
and
don
ferdinando
four
lxxxix
i
returned
to
the
loggia
whither
my
perseus
had
already
been
brought
and
went
on
putting
the
last
touches
to
my
work
under
the
old
difficulties
always
that
is
to
say
lack
of
money
and
a
hundred
untoward
accidents
the
half
of
which
would
have
cowed
a
man
armed
with
adamant
however
i
pursued
my
course
as
usual
and
one
morning
after
i
had
heard
mass
at
san
piero
scheraggio
that
brute
bernardone
broker
worthless
goldsmith
and
by
the
grace
purveyor
to
the
mint
passed
by
me
no
sooner
had
he
got
outside
the
church
than
the
dirty
pig
let
fly
four
cracks
which
might
have
been
heard
from
san
miniato
i
cried
pig
poltroon
donkey
is
that
the
noise
your
filthy
talents
make
and
ran
off
for
a
cudgel
he
took
refuge
on
the
instant
in
the
mint
while
i
stationed
myself
inside
my
housedoor
which
i
left
ajar
setting
a
boy
at
watch
upon
the
street
to
warn
me
when
the
pig
should
leave
the
mint
after
waiting
some
time
i
grew
tired
and
my
heat
cooled
reflecting
then
that
blows
are
not
dealt
by
contract
and
that
some
disaster
might
ensue
i
resolved
to
wreak
my
vengeance
by
another
method
the
incident
took
place
about
the
feast
of
our
san
giovanni
one
or
two
days
before
so
i
composed
four
verses
and
stuck
them
up
in
an
angle
of
the
church
where
people
go
to
ease
themselves
the
verses
ran
as
follows
lieth
bernardone
ass
and
pig
spy
broker
thief
in
whom
pandora
planted
all
her
worst
evils
and
from
thence
transplanted
into
that
brute
carcass
both
the
incident
and
the
verses
went
the
round
of
the
palace
giving
the
duke
and
duchess
much
amusement
but
before
the
man
himself
knew
what
i
had
been
up
to
crowds
of
people
stopped
to
read
the
lines
and
laughed
immoderately
at
them
since
they
were
looking
towards
the
mint
and
fixing
their
eyes
on
bernardone
his
son
maestro
baccio
taking
notice
of
their
gestures
tore
the
paper
down
with
fury
the
elder
bit
his
thumb
shrieking
threats
out
with
that
hideous
voice
of
his
which
comes
forth
through
his
nose
indeed
he
made
a
brave
defiance
note
that
is
the
loggia
lanzi
on
the
great
piazza
of
florence
where
statue
still
stands
note
if
i
understand
the
obscure
lines
of
the
original
cellini
wanted
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
by
this
epigram
both
bernardone
and
his
son
baccio
but
by
buaccio
he
generally
means
baccio
bandinelli
note
to
bite
the
thumb
at
any
one
was
as
students
of
our
old
drama
know
a
sign
of
challenge
or
provocation
xc
when
the
duke
was
informed
that
the
whole
of
my
work
for
the
perseus
could
be
exhibited
as
finished
he
came
one
day
to
look
at
it
his
manner
showed
clearly
that
it
gave
him
great
satisfaction
but
afterwards
he
turned
to
some
gentlemen
attending
him
and
said
this
statue
seems
in
our
eyes
a
very
fine
piece
still
it
has
yet
to
win
the
favour
of
the
people
therefore
my
benvenuto
before
you
put
the
very
last
touches
on
i
should
like
you
for
my
sake
to
remove
a
part
of
the
scaffolding
on
the
side
of
the
piazza
some
day
toward
noon
in
order
that
we
may
learn
what
folk
think
of
it
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
it
is
thrown
open
to
space
and
light
it
will
look
very
differently
from
what
it
does
in
this
i
replied
with
all
humility
to
his
excellency
must
know
my
lord
that
it
will
make
more
than
twice
as
good
a
show
oh
how
is
it
that
your
most
illustrious
excellency
has
forgotten
seeing
it
in
the
garden
of
my
house
there
in
that
large
extent
of
space
it
showed
so
bravely
that
bandinello
coming
through
the
garden
of
the
innocents
to
look
at
it
was
compelled
in
spite
of
his
evil
and
malignant
nature
to
praise
it
he
who
never
praised
aught
or
any
one
in
all
his
life
i
perceive
that
your
excellency
lends
too
ready
an
ear
to
that
when
i
had
done
speaking
he
smiled
ironically
and
a
little
angrily
yet
he
replied
with
great
kindness
what
i
ask
my
benvenuto
just
to
please
when
the
duke
had
left
i
gave
orders
to
have
the
screen
removed
yet
some
trifles
of
gold
varnish
and
various
other
little
finishings
were
still
wanting
wherefore
i
began
to
murmur
and
complain
indignantly
cursing
the
unhappy
day
which
brought
me
to
florence
too
well
i
knew
already
the
great
and
irreparable
sacrifice
i
made
when
i
left
france
nor
could
i
discover
any
reasonable
ground
for
hope
that
i
might
prosper
in
the
future
with
my
prince
and
patron
from
the
commencement
to
the
middle
and
the
ending
everything
that
i
had
done
had
been
performed
to
my
great
disadvantage
therefore
it
was
with
deep
that
i
disclosed
my
statue
on
the
following
day
now
it
pleased
god
that
on
the
instant
of
its
exposure
to
view
a
shout
of
boundless
enthusiasm
went
up
in
commendation
of
my
work
which
consoled
me
not
a
little
the
folk
kept
on
attaching
sonnets
to
the
posts
of
the
door
which
was
protected
with
a
curtain
while
i
gave
the
last
touches
to
the
statue
i
believe
that
on
the
same
day
when
i
opened
it
a
few
hours
to
the
public
more
than
twenty
were
nailed
up
all
of
them
overflowing
with
the
highest
panegyrics
afterwards
when
i
once
more
shut
it
off
from
view
every
day
brought
sonnets
with
latin
and
greek
verses
for
the
university
of
pisa
was
then
in
vacation
and
all
the
doctors
and
scholars
kept
vying
with
each
other
who
could
praise
it
best
but
what
gratified
me
most
and
inspired
me
with
most
hope
of
the
support
was
that
the
artists
sculptors
and
painters
alike
entered
into
the
same
generous
competition
i
set
the
highest
value
on
the
eulogies
of
that
excellent
painter
jacopo
pontormo
and
still
more
on
those
of
his
able
pupil
bronzino
who
was
not
satisfied
with
merely
publishing
his
verses
but
sent
them
by
his
lad
hand
to
my
own
house
they
spoke
so
generously
of
my
performance
in
that
fine
style
of
his
which
is
most
exquisite
that
this
alone
repaid
me
somewhat
for
the
pain
of
my
long
troubles
so
then
i
closed
the
screen
and
once
more
set
myself
to
finishing
my
statue
note
jacopo
carrucci
da
pantormo
was
now
an
old
man
he
died
in
aged
years
angelo
allori
called
il
bronzino
one
of
the
last
fairly
good
florentine
painters
won
considerable
distinction
as
a
writer
of
burlesque
poems
he
died
in
aged
years
we
possess
his
sonnets
of
the
perseus
xci
the
great
compliments
which
this
short
inspection
of
my
perseus
had
elicited
from
the
noble
school
of
florence
though
they
were
well
known
to
the
duke
did
not
prevent
him
from
saying
am
delighted
that
benvenuto
has
had
this
trifling
satisfaction
which
will
spur
him
on
to
the
desired
conclusion
with
more
speed
and
diligence
do
not
however
let
him
imagine
that
when
his
perseus
shall
be
finally
exposed
to
view
from
all
sides
folk
in
general
will
be
so
lavish
of
their
praises
on
the
contrary
i
am
afraid
that
all
its
defects
will
then
be
brought
home
to
him
and
more
will
be
detected
than
the
statue
really
has
so
let
him
arm
himself
with
these
were
precisely
the
words
which
bandinello
had
whispered
in
the
ears
citing
the
works
of
andrea
del
verrocchio
who
made
that
fine
bronze
of
christ
and
thomas
on
the
front
of
orsammichele
at
the
same
time
he
referred
to
many
other
statues
and
dared
even
to
attack
the
marvellous
david
of
divine
michel
agnolo
buonarroti
accusing
it
of
only
looking
well
if
seen
in
front
finally
he
touched
upon
the
multitude
of
sarcastic
sonnets
which
were
called
forth
by
his
own
hercules
and
cacus
and
wound
up
with
abusing
the
people
of
florence
now
the
duke
who
was
too
much
inclined
to
credit
his
assertions
encouraged
the
fellow
to
speak
thus
and
thought
in
his
own
heart
that
things
would
go
as
he
had
prophesied
because
that
envious
creature
bandinello
never
ceased
insinuating
malice
on
one
occasion
it
happened
that
the
gallows
bird
bernardone
the
broker
was
present
at
these
conversations
and
in
support
of
calumnies
he
said
to
the
duke
must
remember
prince
that
statues
on
a
large
scale
are
quite
a
different
dish
of
soup
from
little
figures
i
do
not
refuse
him
the
credit
of
being
excellent
at
statuettes
in
miniature
but
you
will
soon
see
that
he
can
not
succeed
in
that
other
sphere
of
to
these
vile
suggestions
he
added
many
others
of
all
sorts
plying
his
office
and
piling
up
a
mountain
of
lies
to
boot
xcii
now
it
pleased
my
glorious
lord
and
immortal
god
that
at
last
i
brought
the
whole
work
to
completion
and
on
a
certain
thursday
morning
i
exposed
it
to
the
public
gaze
immediately
before
the
sun
was
fully
in
the
heavens
there
assembled
such
a
multitude
of
people
that
no
words
could
describe
them
all
with
one
voice
contended
which
should
praise
it
most
the
duke
was
stationed
at
a
window
low
upon
the
first
floor
of
the
palace
just
above
the
entrance
there
half
hidden
he
heard
everything
the
folk
were
saying
of
my
statue
after
listening
through
several
hours
he
rose
so
proud
and
happy
in
his
heart
that
he
turned
to
his
attendant
messer
sforza
and
exclaimed
go
and
seek
out
benvenuto
tell
him
from
me
that
he
has
delighted
me
far
more
than
i
expected
say
too
that
i
shall
reward
him
in
a
way
which
will
astonish
him
so
bid
him
be
of
good
in
due
course
messer
sforza
discharged
this
glorious
embassy
which
consoled
me
greatly
i
passed
a
happy
day
partly
because
of
the
message
and
also
because
the
folk
kept
pointing
me
out
as
something
marvellous
and
strange
among
the
many
who
did
so
were
two
gentlemen
deputed
by
the
viceroy
of
sicily
to
our
duke
on
public
business
now
these
two
agreeable
persons
met
me
upon
the
piazza
i
had
been
shown
them
in
passing
and
now
they
made
monstrous
haste
to
catch
me
up
then
with
caps
in
hand
they
uttered
an
oration
so
ceremonious
that
it
would
have
been
excessive
for
a
pope
i
bowed
with
every
protestation
of
humility
they
meanwhile
continued
loading
me
with
compliments
until
at
last
i
prayed
them
for
sake
to
leave
the
piazza
in
my
company
because
the
folk
were
stopping
and
staring
at
me
more
than
at
my
perseus
in
the
midst
of
all
these
ceremonies
they
went
so
far
as
to
propose
that
i
should
come
to
sicily
and
offered
to
make
terms
which
should
content
me
they
told
me
how
fra
giovan
agnolo
servi
had
constructed
a
fountain
for
them
complete
in
all
parts
and
decorated
with
a
multitude
of
figures
but
it
was
not
in
the
same
good
style
they
recognised
in
perseus
and
yet
they
had
heaped
riches
on
the
man
i
would
not
suffer
them
to
finish
all
their
speeches
but
answered
give
me
much
cause
for
wonder
seeking
as
you
do
to
make
me
quit
the
service
of
a
prince
who
is
the
greatest
patron
of
the
arts
that
ever
lived
and
i
too
here
in
my
own
birthplace
famous
as
the
school
of
every
art
and
science
oh
if
my
desire
had
been
set
on
lucre
i
could
have
stayed
in
france
with
that
great
monarch
francis
who
gave
me
a
thousand
golden
crowns
a
year
for
board
and
paid
me
in
addition
the
price
of
all
my
labour
in
his
service
i
gained
more
than
four
thousand
golden
crowns
the
with
these
and
such
like
words
i
cut
their
ceremonies
short
thanking
them
for
the
high
praises
they
had
bestowed
upon
me
which
were
indeed
the
best
reward
that
artists
could
receive
for
their
labours
i
told
them
they
had
greatly
stimulated
my
zeal
so
that
i
hoped
after
a
few
years
were
passed
to
exhibit
another
masterpiece
which
i
dared
believe
would
yield
far
truer
satisfaction
to
our
noble
school
of
florence
the
two
gentlemen
were
eager
to
resume
the
thread
of
their
complimentary
proposals
whereupon
i
lifting
my
cap
and
making
a
profound
bow
bade
them
a
polite
farewell

the
increase
i
resolved
to
go
and
present
myself
to
the
duke
who
said
with
great
benvenuto
you
have
satisfied
and
delighted
me
but
i
promise
that
i
will
reward
you
in
such
wise
as
will
make
you
wonder
and
i
tell
you
that
i
do
not
mean
to
delay
beyond
on
hearing
this
most
welcome
assurance
i
turned
all
the
forces
of
my
soul
and
body
to
god
fervently
offering
up
thanks
to
him
at
the
same
moment
i
approached
the
duke
and
almost
weeping
for
gladness
kissed
his
robe
then
i
added
my
glorious
prince
true
and
most
generous
lover
of
the
arts
and
of
those
who
exercise
them
i
entreat
your
most
illustrious
excellency
to
allow
me
eight
days
first
to
go
and
return
thanks
to
god
for
i
alone
know
what
travail
i
have
endured
and
that
my
earnest
faith
has
moved
him
to
assist
me
in
gratitude
for
this
and
all
other
marvellous
mercies
i
should
like
to
travel
eight
days
on
pilgrimage
continually
thanking
my
immortal
god
who
never
fails
to
help
those
who
call
upon
him
with
the
duke
then
asked
me
where
i
wished
to
go
i
answered
i
shall
set
out
for
vallombrosa
thence
to
camaldoli
and
the
ermo
afterwards
i
shall
proceed
to
the
bagni
di
santa
maria
and
perhaps
so
far
as
sestile
because
i
hear
of
fine
antiquities
to
be
seen
there
then
i
shall
retrace
my
steps
by
san
francesco
della
vernia
and
still
with
thanks
to
god
return
to
your
the
duke
replied
at
once
with
cheerful
kindness
and
come
back
again
for
of
a
truth
you
please
me
but
do
not
forget
to
send
a
couple
of
lines
by
way
of
memorandum
and
leave
the
rest
to
i
wrote
four
lines
that
very
day
in
which
i
thanked
his
excellency
for
expected
favours
and
gave
these
to
messer
sforza
who
placed
them
in
the
hands
the
latter
took
them
and
then
handed
them
to
messer
sforza
remarking
that
you
put
these
lines
each
day
where
i
can
see
them
for
if
benvenuto
comes
back
and
finds
i
have
not
despatched
his
business
i
think
that
he
will
murder
thus
laughing
his
excellency
asked
to
be
reminded
messer
sforza
reported
these
precise
words
to
me
on
the
same
evening
laughing
too
and
expressing
wonder
at
the
great
favour
shown
me
by
the
duke
he
pleasantly
added
benvenuto
and
come
again
quickly
for
indeed
i
am
jealous
of
note
the
ermo
is
more
correctly
eremo
and
vernia
is
alvernia
xciv
in
name
then
i
left
florence
continually
singing
psalms
and
prayers
in
his
honour
upon
all
that
journey
i
enjoyed
it
extremely
for
the
season
was
fine
in
early
summer
and
the
country
through
which
i
travelled
and
which
i
had
never
seen
before
struck
me
as
marvellously
beautiful
now
i
had
taken
with
me
to
serve
as
guide
a
young
workman
in
my
employ
who
came
from
bagno
and
was
called
cesare
thanks
to
him
then
i
received
the
kindest
hospitality
from
his
father
and
all
his
family
among
whom
was
an
old
man
of
more
than
seventy
extremely
pleasant
in
his
conversation
he
was
uncle
a
surgeon
by
profession
and
a
dabbler
in
alchemy
this
excellent
person
made
me
observe
that
the
bagni
contained
mines
of
gold
and
silver
and
showed
me
many
interesting
objects
in
the
neighbourhood
so
that
i
enjoyed
myself
as
much
as
i
have
ever
done
one
day
when
we
had
become
intimate
and
he
could
trust
me
he
spoke
as
follows
must
not
omit
to
tell
you
a
thought
of
mine
to
which
his
excellency
might
with
advantage
pay
attention
it
is
that
not
far
from
camaldoli
there
lies
a
mountain
pass
so
ill
defended
that
piero
strozzi
could
not
only
cross
it
without
risk
but
might
also
seize
on
poppi
not
satisfied
with
this
description
he
also
took
a
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pouch
upon
which
the
good
old
man
had
drawn
the
whole
country
so
that
the
seriousness
of
the
danger
could
be
manifest
upon
inspection
of
the
map
i
took
the
design
and
left
bagno
at
once
travelling
homeward
as
fast
as
i
could
by
prato
magno
and
san
francesco
della
vernia
on
reaching
florence
i
only
stopped
to
draw
off
my
and
hurried
to
the
palace
just
opposite
the
badia
i
met
the
duke
who
was
coming
by
the
palace
of
the
podesta
when
he
saw
me
he
gave
me
a
very
gracious
reception
and
showing
some
surprise
exclaimed
have
you
come
back
so
quickly
i
did
not
expect
you
for
eight
days
at
i
answered
service
of
your
most
illustrious
excellency
brings
me
back
else
i
should
very
willingly
have
stayed
some
few
days
longer
on
my
journey
through
that
lovely
and
what
good
news
have
you
said
he
i
answered
i
must
talk
to
you
about
things
of
the
greatest
importance
which
i
have
to
so
i
followed
him
to
the
palace
and
when
we
were
there
he
took
me
privately
into
a
chamber
where
we
stayed
a
while
alone
together
i
then
unfolded
the
whole
matter
and
showed
him
the
little
map
with
which
he
seemed
to
be
much
gratified
when
i
told
his
excellency
that
one
ought
to
take
measures
at
once
he
reflected
for
a
little
while
and
then
said
may
inform
you
that
we
have
agreed
with
the
duke
of
urbino
that
he
should
guard
the
pass
but
do
not
speak
about
then
he
dismissed
me
with
great
demonstrations
of
and
i
went
home
note
a
village
in
the
castenino
piero
strozzi
was
at
this
time
in
valdichiana
xcv
next
day
i
presented
myself
and
after
a
few
words
of
conversation
the
duke
addressed
me
cheerfully
without
fail
i
mean
to
despatch
your
business
set
your
mind
at
rest
i
who
felt
sure
that
he
meant
what
he
said
waited
with
great
impatience
for
the
morrow
when
the
day
arrived
i
betook
me
to
the
palace
and
as
it
always
happens
that
evil
tidings
travel
faster
than
good
news
messer
giacopo
guidi
secretary
to
his
excellency
called
me
with
his
wry
mouth
and
haughty
voice
drawing
himself
up
as
stiff
as
a
poker
he
began
to
speak
to
this
effect
duke
says
he
wants
you
to
tell
him
how
much
you
ask
for
your
i
remained
dumbfounded
and
astonished
yet
i
quickly
replied
that
it
was
not
my
custom
to
put
prices
on
my
work
and
that
this
was
not
what
his
excellency
had
promised
me
two
days
ago
the
man
raised
his
voice
and
ordered
me
expressly
in
the
name
under
the
penalty
of
his
severe
displeasure
to
say
how
much
i
wanted
now
i
had
hoped
not
only
to
gain
some
handsome
reward
trusting
to
the
mighty
signs
of
kindness
shown
me
by
the
duke
but
i
had
still
more
expected
to
secure
the
entire
good
graces
of
his
excellency
seeing
i
never
asked
for
anything
but
only
for
his
favour
accordingly
this
wholly
unexpected
way
of
dealing
with
me
put
me
in
a
fury
and
i
was
especially
enraged
by
the
manner
which
that
venomous
toad
assumed
in
discharging
his
commission
i
exclaimed
that
if
the
duke
gave
me
ten
thousand
crowns
i
should
not
be
paid
enough
and
that
if
i
had
ever
thought
things
would
come
to
this
haggling
i
should
not
have
settled
in
his
service
thereupon
the
surly
fellow
began
to
abuse
me
and
i
gave
it
him
back
again
upon
the
following
day
when
i
paid
my
respects
to
the
duke
he
beckoned
to
me
i
approached
and
he
exclaimed
in
anger
and
great
palaces
are
built
with
ten
thousands
of
i
rejoined
excellency
can
find
multitudes
of
men
who
are
able
to
build
you
cities
and
palaces
but
you
will
not
perhaps
find
one
man
in
the
world
who
could
make
a
second
then
i
took
my
leave
without
saying
or
doing
anything
farther
a
few
days
afterwards
the
duchess
sent
for
me
and
advised
me
to
put
my
difference
with
the
duke
into
her
hands
since
she
thought
she
could
conduct
the
business
to
my
satisfaction
on
hearing
these
kindly
words
i
replied
that
i
had
never
asked
any
other
recompense
for
my
labours
than
the
good
graces
of
the
duke
and
that
his
most
illustrious
excellency
had
assured
me
of
this
it
was
not
needful
that
i
should
place
in
their
hands
what
i
had
always
frankly
left
to
them
from
the
first
days
when
i
undertook
their
service
i
farther
added
that
if
his
most
illustrious
excellency
gave
me
but
a
which
is
worth
five
farthings
for
my
work
i
should
consider
myself
contented
provided
only
that
his
excellency
did
not
deprive
me
of
his
favour
at
these
words
the
duchess
smiled
a
little
and
said
you
would
do
well
to
act
as
i
advise
then
she
turned
her
back
and
left
me
i
thought
it
was
my
best
policy
to
speak
with
the
humility
i
have
above
described
yet
it
turned
out
that
i
had
done
the
worst
for
myself
because
albeit
she
had
harboured
some
angry
feelings
toward
me
she
had
in
her
a
certain
way
of
dealing
which
was
generous
note
it
appears
from
a
letter
written
by
guidi
to
bandinelli
that
he
hated
cellini
whom
he
called
mostro
di
natura
guidi
was
made
bishop
of
penna
in
and
attended
the
council
of
trent
note
a
small
tuscan
coin
xcvi
about
that
time
i
was
very
intimate
with
girolamo
degli
albizzi
commissary
of
the
militia
one
day
this
friend
said
to
me
benvenuto
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
to
put
your
little
difference
of
opinion
with
the
duke
to
rights
and
i
assure
you
that
if
you
repose
confidence
in
me
i
feel
myself
the
man
to
settle
matters
i
know
what
i
am
saying
the
duke
is
getting
really
angry
and
you
will
come
badly
out
of
the
affair
let
this
suffice
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
say
all
i
now
subsequently
to
that
conversation
with
the
duchess
i
had
been
told
by
some
one
possibly
a
rogue
that
he
had
heard
how
the
duke
said
upon
some
occasion
which
offered
itself
less
than
two
farthings
i
will
throw
perseus
to
the
dogs
and
so
our
differences
will
be
this
then
made
me
anxious
and
induced
me
to
entrust
girolamo
degli
albizzi
with
the
negotiations
telling
him
anything
would
satisfy
me
provided
i
retained
the
good
graces
of
the
duke
that
honest
fellow
was
excellent
in
all
his
dealings
with
soldiers
especially
with
the
militia
who
are
for
the
most
part
rustics
but
he
had
no
taste
for
statuary
and
therefore
could
not
understand
its
conditions
consequently
when
he
spoke
to
the
duke
he
began
thus
benvenuto
has
placed
himself
in
my
hands
and
has
begged
me
to
recommend
him
to
your
the
duke
replied
too
am
willing
to
refer
myself
to
you
and
shall
be
satisfied
with
your
thereupon
girolamo
composed
a
letter
with
much
skill
and
greatly
to
my
honour
fixing
the
sum
which
the
duke
would
have
to
pay
me
at
golden
crowns
in
gold
and
this
should
not
be
taken
as
my
proper
recompense
for
such
a
masterpiece
but
only
as
a
kind
of
gratuity
enough
to
say
that
i
was
satisfied
with
many
other
phrases
of
like
tenor
all
of
which
implied
the
price
which
i
have
mentioned
the
duke
signed
this
agreement
as
gladly
as
i
took
it
sadly
when
the
duchess
heard
she
said
would
have
been
better
for
that
poor
man
if
he
had
placed
himself
in
my
hands
i
could
have
got
him
five
thousand
crowns
in
one
day
when
i
went
to
the
palace
she
repeated
these
same
words
to
me
in
the
presence
of
messer
alamanno
salviati
and
laughed
at
me
a
little
saying
that
i
deserved
my
bad
luck
the
duke
gave
orders
that
i
should
be
paid
a
hundred
golden
crowns
in
gold
per
month
until
the
sum
was
discharged
and
thus
it
ran
for
some
months
afterwards
messer
antonio
nobili
who
had
to
transact
the
business
began
to
give
me
fifty
and
sometimes
later
on
he
gave
me
and
sometimes
nothing
accordingly
when
i
saw
that
the
settlement
was
being
thus
deferred
i
spoke
to
messer
antonio
and
begged
him
to
explain
why
he
did
not
complete
my
payments
he
answered
in
a
like
tone
of
politeness
yet
it
struck
me
that
he
exposed
his
own
mind
too
much
let
the
reader
judge
he
began
by
saying
that
the
sole
reason
why
he
could
not
go
forward
regularly
with
these
payments
was
the
scarcity
of
money
at
the
palace
but
he
promised
when
cash
came
in
to
discharge
arrears
then
he
added
heavens
if
i
did
not
pay
you
i
should
be
an
utter
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
hear
him
speak
in
that
way
yet
i
resolved
to
hope
that
he
would
pay
me
when
he
had
the
power
to
do
so
but
when
i
observed
that
things
went
quite
the
contrary
way
and
saw
that
i
was
being
pillaged
i
lost
temper
with
the
man
and
recalled
to
his
memory
hotly
and
in
anger
what
he
had
declared
he
would
be
if
he
did
not
pay
me
however
he
died
and
five
hundred
crowns
are
still
owing
to
me
at
the
present
date
which
is
nigh
upon
the
end
of
there
was
also
a
balance
due
upon
my
salary
which
i
thought
would
be
forgotten
since
three
years
had
elapsed
without
payment
but
it
so
happened
that
the
duke
fell
ill
of
a
serious
malady
remaining
hours
without
passing
water
finding
that
the
remedies
of
his
physicians
availed
nothing
it
is
probable
that
he
betook
himself
to
god
and
therefore
decreed
the
discharge
of
all
debts
to
his
servants
i
too
was
paid
on
this
occasion
yet
i
never
obtained
what
still
stood
out
upon
my
perseus
note
a
warm
partisan
of
the
medici
he
was
a
cousin
of
maria
salviati
mother
it
was
rumoured
that
he
caused
the
historian
francesco
death
by
poison
we
find
him
godfather
to
one
of
children
note
this
salviati
and
the
nobili
mentioned
afterwards
occupied
a
distinguished
place
in
florentine
annals
as
partisans
of
the
medici
note
cellini
began
to
write
his
in
eight
years
had
therefore
now
elapsed
xcvii
i
had
almost
determined
to
say
nothing
more
about
that
unlucky
perseus
but
a
most
remarkable
incident
which
i
do
not
like
to
omit
obliges
me
to
do
so
wherefore
i
must
now
turn
back
a
bit
to
gather
up
the
thread
of
my
narration
i
thought
i
was
acting
for
the
best
when
i
told
the
duchess
that
i
could
not
compromise
affairs
which
were
no
longer
in
my
hands
seeing
i
had
informed
the
duke
that
i
should
gladly
accept
whatever
he
chose
to
give
me
i
said
this
in
the
hope
of
gaining
favour
and
with
this
manifestation
of
submissiveness
i
employed
every
likely
means
of
pacifying
his
resentment
for
i
ought
to
add
that
a
few
days
before
he
came
to
terms
with
albizzi
the
duke
had
shown
he
was
excessively
displeased
with
me
the
reason
was
as
follows
i
complained
of
some
abominable
acts
of
injustice
done
to
me
by
messer
alfonso
quistelli
messer
jacopo
polverino
of
the
exchequer
and
more
than
all
by
ser
giovanbattista
brandini
of
volterra
when
therefore
i
set
forth
my
cause
with
some
vehemence
the
duke
flew
into
the
greatest
rage
conceivable
being
thus
in
anger
he
exclaimed
is
just
the
same
as
with
your
perseus
when
you
asked
those
ten
thousand
crowns
you
let
yourself
be
blinded
by
mere
cupidity
therefore
i
shall
have
the
statue
valued
and
shall
give
you
what
the
experts
think
it
to
these
words
i
replied
with
too
much
daring
and
a
touch
of
indignation
which
is
always
out
of
place
in
dealing
with
great
princes
is
it
possible
that
my
work
should
be
valued
at
its
proper
worth
when
there
is
not
a
man
in
florence
capable
of
performing
it
that
increased
his
irritation
he
uttered
many
furious
phrases
and
among
them
said
is
in
florence
at
this
day
a
man
well
able
to
make
such
a
statue
and
who
is
therefore
highly
capable
of
judging
he
meant
bandinello
cavaliere
of
jacopo
then
i
rejoined
lord
your
most
illustrious
excellency
gave
me
the
means
of
producing
an
important
and
very
difficult
masterpiece
in
the
midst
of
this
the
noblest
school
of
the
world
and
my
work
has
been
received
with
warmer
praises
than
any
other
heretofore
exposed
before
the
gaze
of
our
incomparable
masters
my
chief
pride
is
the
commendation
of
those
able
men
who
both
understand
and
practise
the
arts
of
design
as
in
particular
bronzino
the
painter
this
man
set
himself
to
work
and
composed
four
sonnets
couched
in
the
choicest
style
and
full
of
honour
to
myself
perhaps
it
was
his
example
which
moved
the
whole
city
to
such
a
tumult
of
enthusiasm
i
freely
admit
that
if
sculpture
were
his
business
instead
of
painting
then
bronzino
might
have
been
equal
a
to
task
like
mine
michel
agnolo
buonarroti
again
whom
i
am
proud
to
call
my
master
he
i
admit
could
have
achieved
the
same
success
when
he
was
young
but
not
with
less
fatigue
and
trouble
than
i
endured
but
now
that
he
is
far
advanced
in
years
he
would
most
certainly
be
found
unequal
to
the
strain
therefore
i
think
i
am
justified
in
saying
that
no
man
known
upon
this
earth
could
have
produced
my
perseus
for
the
rest
my
work
has
received
the
greatest
reward
i
could
have
wished
for
in
this
world
chiefly
and
especially
because
your
most
illustrious
excellency
not
only
expressed
yourself
satisfied
but
praised
it
far
more
highly
than
any
one
beside
what
greater
and
more
honourable
prize
could
be
desired
by
me
i
affirm
most
emphatically
that
your
excellency
could
not
pay
me
with
more
glorious
coin
nor
add
from
any
treasury
a
wealth
surpassing
this
therefore
i
hold
myself
overpaid
already
and
return
thanks
to
your
most
illustrious
excellency
with
all
my
the
duke
made
answer
you
think
i
have
not
the
money
to
pay
you
for
my
part
i
promise
you
that
i
shall
pay
you
more
for
the
statue
than
it
is
then
i
retorted
did
not
picture
to
my
fancy
any
better
recompense
from
your
excellency
yet
i
account
myself
amply
remunerated
by
that
first
reward
which
the
school
of
florence
gave
me
with
this
to
console
me
i
shall
take
my
departure
on
the
instant
without
returning
to
the
house
you
gave
me
and
shall
never
seek
to
set
my
foot
in
this
town
we
were
just
at
felicita
and
his
excellency
was
proceeding
to
the
palace
when
he
heard
these
choleric
words
he
turned
upon
me
in
stern
anger
and
exclaimed
shall
not
go
take
heed
you
do
not
go
half
terrified
i
then
followed
him
to
the
palace
on
arriving
there
his
excellency
sent
for
the
archbishop
of
pisa
named
de
bartolini
and
messer
pandolfo
della
stufa
requesting
them
to
order
baccio
bandinelli
in
his
name
to
examine
well
my
perseus
and
value
it
since
he
wished
to
pay
its
exact
price
these
excellent
men
went
forthwith
and
performed
their
embassy
in
reply
bandinello
said
that
he
had
examined
the
statue
minutely
and
knew
well
enough
what
it
was
worth
but
having
been
on
bad
terms
otherwise
with
me
for
some
time
past
he
did
not
care
to
be
entangled
anyhow
in
my
affairs
then
they
began
to
put
a
gentle
pressure
on
him
saying
duke
ordered
us
to
tell
you
under
pain
of
his
displeasure
that
you
are
to
value
the
statue
and
you
may
have
two
or
three
days
to
consider
your
estimate
when
you
have
done
so
tell
us
at
what
price
it
ought
to
be
he
answered
that
his
judgment
was
already
formed
that
he
could
not
disobey
the
duke
and
that
my
work
was
rich
and
beautiful
and
excellent
in
execution
therefore
he
thought
sixteen
thousand
crowns
or
more
would
not
be
an
excessive
price
for
it
those
good
and
courteous
gentlemen
reported
this
to
the
duke
who
was
mightily
enraged
they
also
told
the
same
to
me
i
replied
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
induce
me
to
take
praise
from
bandinello
that
this
bad
man
speaks
ill
of
my
words
were
carried
to
the
duke
and
that
was
the
reason
why
the
duchess
wanted
me
to
place
the
matter
in
her
hands
all
that
i
have
written
is
the
pure
truth
i
will
only
add
that
i
ought
to
have
trusted
to
her
intervention
for
then
i
should
have
been
quickly
paid
and
should
have
received
so
much
more
into
the
bargain

pandolfo

had
been
to

while
dauphinéss
xcviii
the
duke
sent
me
word
by
messer
lelio
torello
his
master
of
the
rolls
that
he
wanted
me
to
execute
some
in
bronze
for
the
choir
of
maria
del
fiore
now
the
choir
was
by
bandinello
and
i
did
not
choose
to
enrich
his
bad
work
with
my
labours
he
had
not
indeed
designed
it
for
he
understood
nothing
whatever
about
architecture
the
design
was
given
by
giuliano
the
son
of
that
baccio
the
who
spoiled
the
cupola
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
shows
no
talent
for
both
reasons
i
was
determined
not
to
undertake
the
task
although
i
told
the
duke
politely
that
i
would
do
whatever
his
most
illustrious
excellency
ordered
accordingly
he
put
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
the
board
of
works
for
maria
del
fiore
telling
them
to
come
to
an
agreement
with
me
he
would
continue
my
allowance
of
two
hundred
crowns
a
year
while
they
were
to
supply
the
rest
out
of
their
funds
in
due
course
i
came
before
the
board
and
they
told
me
what
the
duke
had
arranged
feeling
that
i
could
explain
my
views
more
frankly
to
these
gentlemen
i
began
by
demonstrating
that
so
many
histories
in
bronze
would
cost
a
vast
amount
of
money
which
would
be
totally
thrown
away
giving
all
my
reasons
which
they
fully
appreciated
in
the
first
place
i
said
that
the
construction
of
the
choir
was
altogether
incorrect
without
proportion
art
convenience
grace
or
good
design
in
the
next
place
the
would
have
to
stand
too
low
beneath
the
proper
line
of
vision
they
would
become
a
place
for
dogs
to
piss
at
and
be
always
full
of
ordure
consequently
i
declined
positively
to
execute
them
however
since
i
did
not
wish
to
throw
away
the
best
years
of
my
life
and
was
eager
to
serve
his
most
illustrious
excellency
whom
i
had
the
sincerest
desire
to
gratify
and
obey
i
made
the
following
proposal
let
the
duke
if
he
wants
to
employ
my
talents
give
me
the
middle
door
of
the
cathedral
to
perform
in
bronze
this
would
be
well
seen
and
would
confer
far
more
glory
on
his
most
illustrious
excellency
i
would
bind
myself
by
contract
to
receive
no
remuneration
unless
i
produced
something
better
than
the
finest
of
the
baptistery
doors
but
if
i
completed
it
according
to
my
promise
then
i
was
willing
to
have
it
valued
and
to
be
paid
one
thousand
crowns
less
than
the
estimate
made
by
experts
the
members
of
the
board
were
well
pleased
with
this
suggestion
and
went
at
once
to
report
the
matter
to
the
duke
among
them
being
piero
salviati
they
expected
him
to
be
extremely
gratified
with
their
communication
but
it
turned
out
just
the
contrary
he
replied
that
i
was
always
wanting
to
do
the
exact
opposite
of
what
he
bade
me
and
so
piero
left
him
without
coming
to
any
conclusion
on
hearing
this
i
went
off
to
the
duke
at
once
who
displayed
some
irritation
when
he
saw
me
however
i
begged
him
to
condescend
to
hear
me
and
he
replied
that
he
was
willing
i
then
began
from
the
beginning
and
used
such
convincing
arguments
that
he
saw
at
last
how
the
matter
really
stood
since
i
made
it
evident
that
he
would
only
be
throwing
a
large
sum
of
money
away
then
i
softened
his
temper
by
suggesting
that
if
his
most
illustrious
excellency
did
not
care
to
have
the
door
begun
two
pulpits
had
anyhow
to
be
made
for
the
choir
and
that
these
would
both
of
them
be
considerable
works
which
would
confer
glory
on
his
reign
for
my
part
i
was
ready
to
execute
a
great
number
of
bronze
with
appropriate
decorations
in
this
way
i
brought
him
round
and
he
gave
me
orders
to
construct
the
models
accordingly
i
set
at
work
on
several
models
and
bestowed
immense
pains
on
them
among
these
there
was
one
with
eight
panels
carried
out
with
far
more
science
than
the
rest
and
which
seemed
to
me
more
fitted
for
the
purpose
having
taken
them
several
times
to
the
place
his
excellency
sent
word
by
messer
cesare
the
keeper
of
his
wardrobe
that
i
should
leave
them
there
after
the
duke
had
inspected
them
i
perceived
that
he
had
selected
the
least
beautiful
one
day
he
sent
for
me
and
during
our
conversation
about
the
models
i
gave
many
reasons
why
the
octagonal
pulpit
would
be
far
more
convenient
for
its
destined
uses
and
would
produce
a
much
finer
effect
he
answered
that
he
wished
me
to
make
it
square
because
he
liked
that
form
better
and
thus
he
went
on
conversing
for
some
time
very
pleasantly
i
meanwhile
lost
no
opportunity
of
saying
everything
i
could
in
the
interests
of
art
now
whether
the
duke
knew
that
i
had
spoken
the
truth
or
whether
he
wanted
to
have
his
own
way
a
long
time
passed
before
i
heard
anything
more
about
it

xcix
about
this
time
the
great
block
of
marble
arrived
which
was
intended
for
the
neptune
it
had
been
brought
up
the
arno
and
then
by
the
grieve
to
the
road
at
poggio
a
caiano
in
order
to
be
carried
to
florence
by
that
level
way
and
there
i
went
to
see
it
now
i
knew
very
well
that
the
duchess
by
her
special
influence
had
managed
to
have
it
given
to
bandinello
no
envy
prompted
me
to
dispute
his
claims
but
rather
pity
for
that
poor
unfortunate
piece
of
marble
observe
by
the
way
that
everything
whatever
it
may
be
which
is
subject
to
an
evil
destiny
although
one
tries
to
save
it
from
some
manifest
evil
falls
at
once
into
far
worse
plight
as
happened
to
this
marble
when
it
came
into
the
hands
of
bartolommeo
ammanato
of
whom
i
shall
speak
the
truth
in
its
proper
place
after
inspecting
this
most
splendid
block
i
measured
it
in
every
direction
and
on
returning
to
florence
made
several
little
models
suited
to
its
proportions
then
i
went
to
poggio
a
caiano
where
the
duke
and
duchess
were
staying
with
their
son
the
prince
i
found
them
all
at
table
the
duke
and
duchess
dining
in
a
private
apartment
so
i
entered
into
conversation
with
the
prince
we
had
been
speaking
for
a
long
while
when
the
duke
who
was
in
a
room
adjacent
heard
my
voice
and
condescended
very
graciously
to
send
for
me
when
i
presented
myself
before
their
excellencies
the
duchess
addressed
me
in
a
very
pleasant
tone
and
having
thus
opened
the
conversation
i
gradually
introduced
the
subject
of
that
noble
block
of
marble
i
had
seen
i
then
proceeded
to
remark
that
their
ancestors
had
brought
the
magnificent
school
of
florence
to
such
a
pitch
of
excellence
only
by
stimulating
competition
among
artists
in
their
several
branches
it
was
thus
that
the
wonderful
cupola
and
the
lovely
doors
of
san
giovanni
had
been
produced
together
with
those
multitudes
of
handsome
edifices
and
statues
which
made
a
crown
of
artistic
glory
for
their
city
above
anything
the
world
had
seen
since
the
days
of
the
ancients
upon
this
the
duchess
with
some
anger
observed
that
she
very
well
knew
what
i
meant
and
bade
me
never
mention
that
block
of
marble
in
her
presence
since
she
did
not
like
it
i
replied
then
you
do
not
like
me
to
act
as
the
attorney
of
your
excellencies
and
to
do
my
utmost
to
ensure
your
being
better
served
reflect
upon
it
my
lady
if
your
most
illustrious
excellencies
think
fit
to
open
the
model
for
a
neptune
to
competition
although
you
are
resolved
to
give
it
to
bandinello
this
will
urge
bandinello
for
his
own
credit
to
display
greater
art
and
science
than
if
he
knew
he
had
no
rivals
in
this
way
my
princes
you
will
be
far
better
served
and
will
not
discourage
our
school
of
artists
you
will
be
able
to
perceive
which
of
us
is
eager
to
excel
in
the
grand
style
of
our
noble
calling
and
will
show
yourselves
princes
who
enjoy
and
understand
the
fine
the
duchess
in
a
great
rage
told
me
that
i
tired
her
patience
out
she
wanted
the
marble
for
bandinello
adding
the
duke
for
his
excellency
also
means
bandinello
to
have
when
the
duchess
had
spoken
the
duke
who
had
kept
silence
up
to
this
time
said
years
ago
i
had
that
fine
block
quarried
especially
for
bandinello
and
so
i
mean
that
bandinello
shall
have
it
to
do
what
he
likes
with
i
turned
to
the
duke
and
spoke
as
follows
lord
i
entreat
your
most
illustrious
excellency
to
lend
a
patient
hearing
while
i
speak
four
words
in
your
he
told
me
to
say
all
i
wanted
and
that
he
would
listen
then
i
began
will
remember
my
lord
that
the
marble
which
bandinello
used
for
his
hercules
and
cacus
was
quarried
for
our
incomparable
michel
agnolo
buonarroti
he
had
made
the
model
for
a
samson
with
four
figures
which
would
have
been
the
finest
masterpiece
in
the
whole
world
but
your
bandinello
got
out
of
it
only
two
figures
both
and
bungled
in
the
worst
manner
wherefore
our
school
still
exclaims
against
the
great
wrong
which
was
done
to
that
magnificent
block
i
believe
that
more
than
a
thousand
sonnets
were
put
up
in
abuse
of
that
detestable
performance
and
i
know
that
your
most
illustrious
excellency
remembers
the
fact
very
well
therefore
my
powerful
prince
seeing
how
the
men
to
whose
care
that
work
was
entrusted
in
their
want
of
taste
and
wisdom
took
michel
marble
away
from
him
and
gave
it
to
bandinello
who
spoilt
it
in
the
way
the
whole
world
knows
oh
will
you
suffer
this
far
more
splendid
block
although
it
belongs
to
bandinello
to
remain
in
the
hands
of
that
man
who
can
not
help
mangling
it
instead
of
giving
it
to
some
artist
of
talent
capable
of
doing
it
full
justice
arrange
my
lord
that
every
one
who
likes
shall
make
a
model
have
them
all
exhibited
to
the
school
you
then
will
hear
what
the
school
thinks
your
own
good
judgment
will
enable
you
to
select
the
best
in
this
way
finally
you
will
not
throw
away
your
money
nor
discourage
a
band
of
artists
the
like
of
whom
is
not
to
be
found
at
present
in
the
world
and
who
form
the
glory
of
your
most
illustrious
the
duke
listened
with
the
utmost
graciousness
then
he
rose
from
table
and
turning
to
me
said
my
benvenuto
make
a
model
and
earn
that
fine
marble
for
yourself
for
what
you
say
is
the
truth
and
i
acknowledge
the
duchess
tossed
her
head
defiantly
and
muttered
i
know
not
what
angry
sentences
i
made
them
a
respectful
bow
and
returned
to
florence
burning
with
eagerness
to
set
hands
upon
my
model
note
instead
of
the
grieve
which
is
not
a
navigable
stream
it
appears
that
cellini
ought
to
have
written
the
ombrone
note
this
sculptor
was
born
in
and
died
in
he
worked
under
bandinelli
and
sansovino
c
when
the
duke
came
to
florence
he
sought
me
at
my
house
without
giving
me
previous
notice
i
showed
him
two
little
models
of
different
design
though
he
praised
them
both
he
said
that
one
of
them
pleased
him
better
than
the
other
i
was
to
finish
the
one
he
liked
with
care
and
this
would
be
to
my
advantage
now
his
excellency
had
already
seen
designs
and
those
of
other
sculptors
but
as
i
was
informed
by
many
of
his
courtiers
who
had
heard
him
he
commended
mine
far
above
the
rest
among
other
matters
worthy
of
record
and
of
great
weight
upon
this
point
i
will
mention
the
following
the
cardinal
of
santa
fiore
was
on
a
visit
to
florence
and
the
duke
took
him
to
poggio
a
caiano
upon
the
road
noticing
the
marble
as
he
passed
the
cardinal
praised
it
highly
inquiring
of
his
excellency
for
what
sculptor
he
intended
it
the
duke
replied
at
once
my
friend
benvenuto
who
has
made
a
splendid
model
with
a
view
to
this
was
reported
to
me
by
men
whom
i
could
trust
hearing
what
the
duke
had
said
i
went
to
the
duchess
and
took
her
some
small
bits
of
work
which
greatly
pleased
her
excellency
then
she
asked
what
i
was
doing
and
i
replied
lady
i
have
taken
in
hand
for
my
pleasure
one
of
the
most
laborious
pieces
which
have
ever
been
produced
it
is
a
christ
of
the
whitest
marble
set
upon
a
cross
of
the
blackest
exactly
of
the
same
size
as
a
tall
man
she
immediately
inquired
what
i
meant
to
do
with
it
i
answered
must
know
my
lady
that
i
would
not
sell
it
for
two
thousand
golden
ducats
it
is
of
such
difficult
execution
that
i
think
no
man
ever
attempted
the
like
before
nor
would
i
have
undertaken
it
at
the
commission
of
any
prince
whatever
for
fear
i
might
prove
inadequate
to
the
task
i
bought
the
marbles
with
my
own
money
and
have
kept
a
young
man
some
two
years
as
my
assistant
in
the
work
what
with
the
stone
the
iron
frame
to
hold
it
up
and
the
wages
it
has
cost
me
above
three
hundred
crowns
consequently
i
would
not
sell
it
for
two
thousand
but
if
your
excellency
deigns
to
grant
me
a
favour
which
is
wholly
blameless
i
shall
be
delighted
to
make
you
a
present
of
it
all
i
ask
is
that
your
excellency
will
not
use
your
influence
either
against
or
for
the
models
which
the
duke
has
ordered
to
be
made
of
the
neptune
for
that
great
block
of
she
replied
with
mighty
indignation
then
you
value
neither
my
help
nor
my
opposition
the
contrary
i
value
them
highly
princess
or
why
am
i
offering
to
give
you
what
i
value
at
two
thousand
ducats
but
i
have
such
confidence
in
my
laborious
and
studies
that
i
hope
to
win
the
palm
even
against
the
great
michel
agnolo
buonarroti
from
whom
and
from
no
one
else
i
have
learned
all
that
i
know
indeed
i
should
be
much
better
pleased
to
enter
into
competition
with
him
who
knows
so
much
than
with
those
others
who
know
but
little
of
their
art
contending
with
my
sublime
master
i
could
gain
laurels
in
plenty
whereas
there
are
but
few
to
be
reaped
in
a
contest
with
these
after
i
had
spoken
she
rose
in
a
mood
and
i
returned
to
work
with
all
the
strength
i
had
upon
my
model
when
it
was
finished
the
duke
came
to
see
it
bringing
with
him
two
ambassadors
one
from
the
duke
of
ferrara
the
other
from
the
signory
of
lucca
they
were
delighted
and
the
duke
said
to
those
two
gentlemen
my
word
benvenuto
deserves
to
have
the
then
they
both
paid
me
the
highest
compliments
especially
the
envoy
from
lucca
who
was
a
person
of
accomplishments
and
learning
i
had
retired
to
some
distance
in
order
that
they
might
exchange
opinions
freely
but
when
i
heard
that
i
was
being
complimented
i
came
up
turned
to
the
duke
and
said
lord
your
most
illustrious
excellency
ought
now
to
employ
another
admirable
device
decree
that
every
one
who
likes
shall
make
a
model
in
clay
exactly
of
the
same
size
as
the
marble
has
to
be
in
this
way
you
will
be
able
to
judge
far
better
who
deserves
the
commission
and
i
may
observe
that
if
your
excellency
does
not
give
it
to
the
sculptor
who
deserves
it
this
will
not
wrong
the
man
so
much
but
will
reflect
great
discredit
upon
yourself
since
the
loss
and
shame
will
fall
on
you
on
the
other
hand
if
you
award
it
to
the
one
who
has
deserved
it
you
will
acquire
great
glory
in
the
first
place
and
will
employ
your
treasure
well
while
artists
will
believe
that
you
appreciate
and
understand
their
no
sooner
had
i
finished
speaking
than
the
duke
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
began
to
move
away
while
they
were
taking
leave
the
ambassador
of
lucca
said
to
the
duke
this
benvenuto
of
yours
is
a
terrible
man
the
duke
responded
is
much
more
terrible
than
you
imagine
and
well
were
it
for
him
if
he
were
a
little
less
terrible
then
he
would
possess
at
the
present
moment
many
things
which
he
has
not
these
precise
words
were
reported
to
me
by
the
envoy
by
way
of
chiding
and
advising
me
to
change
my
conduct
i
told
him
that
i
had
the
greatest
wish
to
oblige
my
lord
as
his
affectionate
and
faithful
servant
but
that
i
did
not
understand
the
arts
of
flattery
several
months
after
this
date
bandinello
died
and
it
was
thought
that
in
addition
to
his
intemperate
habits
of
life
the
mortification
of
having
probably
to
lose
the
marble
contributed
to
his
decline
note
probably
girolamo
lucchesini
ci
bandinello
had
received
information
of
the
crucifix
which
as
i
have
said
above
i
was
now
engaged
upon
accordingly
he
laid
his
hands
at
once
upon
a
block
of
marble
and
produced
the
pietŕ
which
may
be
seen
in
the
church
of
the
annunziata
now
i
had
offered
my
crucifix
to
maria
novella
and
had
already
fixed
up
the
iron
clamps
whereby
i
meant
to
fasten
it
against
the
wall
i
only
asked
for
permission
to
construct
a
little
sarcophagus
upon
the
ground
beneath
the
feet
of
christ
into
which
i
might
creep
when
i
was
dead
the
friars
told
me
that
they
could
not
grant
this
without
the
consent
of
their
building
committee
i
replied
brethren
why
did
not
you
consult
your
committee
before
you
allowed
me
to
place
my
crucifix
without
their
leave
you
suffered
me
to
fix
my
clamps
and
other
necessary
on
this
account
i
refused
to
give
those
fruits
of
my
enormous
labours
to
the
church
of
maria
novella
even
though
the
overseers
of
the
fabric
came
and
begged
me
for
the
crucifix
i
turned
at
once
to
the
church
of
the
annunziata
and
when
i
explained
the
terms
on
which
i
had
sought
to
make
a
present
of
it
to
maria
novella
those
virtuous
friars
of
the
nunziata
unanimously
told
me
to
place
it
in
their
church
and
let
me
make
my
grave
according
to
my
will
and
pleasure
when
bandinello
became
aware
of
this
he
set
to
work
with
great
diligence
at
the
completion
of
his
pietŕ
and
prayed
the
duchess
to
get
for
him
the
chapel
of
the
pazzi
for
his
monument
this
he
obtained
with
some
difficulty
and
on
receiving
the
permission
he
erected
his
pietŕ
with
great
haste
it
was
not
altogether
completed
when
he
died
the
duchess
then
said
that
even
as
she
had
protected
him
in
life
so
would
she
protect
him
in
the
grave
and
that
albeit
he
was
dead
i
need
never
try
to
get
that
block
of
marble
apropos
of
which
the
broken
bernardone
meeting
me
one
day
in
the
country
said
that
the
duchess
had
assigned
the
marble
i
replied
piece
of
stone
in
the
hands
of
bandinello
it
would
certainly
have
come
to
grief
but
in
those
of
ammanato
its
fate
is
a
hundred
times
now
i
had
received
orders
from
the
duke
to
make
a
clay
model
of
the
same
size
as
the
marble
would
allow
he
also
provided
me
with
wood
and
clay
set
up
a
sort
of
screen
in
the
loggia
where
my
perseus
stands
and
paid
me
one
workman
i
went
about
my
business
with
all
diligence
and
constructed
the
wooden
framework
according
to
my
excellent
system
then
i
brought
the
model
successfully
to
a
conclusion
without
caring
whether
i
should
have
to
execute
it
in
marble
since
i
knew
the
duchess
was
resolved
i
should
not
get
the
commission
consequently
i
paid
no
heed
to
that
only
i
felt
very
glad
to
undergo
this
labour
hoping
to
make
the
duchess
who
was
after
all
a
person
of
intelligence
as
indeed
i
had
the
means
of
observing
at
a
later
period
repent
of
having
done
so
great
a
wrong

to
the
marble

herself

of

out
well
and
wanted
to
begin
upon
the

the

i
had
already

sketched

the

came
down
from
the

took
him
into

this
man
had
been
engaged
there
with
his
own
hands
several
days
in
company
with
ammanato
and
all
his
workpeople
while
then
the
duke
was
inspecting
model
i
received
intelligence
that
he
seemed
but
little
pleased
with
it
in
spite
of
trying
to
dose
him
with
his
fluent
nonsense
the
duke
shook
his
head
and
turning
to
messer
gianstefano
exclaimed
and
ask
benvenuto
if
his
colossal
statue
is
far
enough
forward
for
him
to
gratify
us

glance
at
messer
gianstefano
discharged
this
embassy
with
great
tact
and
in
the
most
courteous
terms
he
added
that
if
i
did
not
think
my
work
quite
ready
to
be
seen
yet
i
might
say
so
frankly
since
the
duke
knew
well
that
i
had
enjoyed
but
little
assistance
for
so
large
an
undertaking
i
replied
that
i
entreated
him
to
do
me
the
favour
of
coming
for
though
my
model
was
not
far
advanced
yet
the
intelligence
of
his
excellency
would
enable
him
to
comprehend
perfectly
how
it
was
likely
to
look
when
finished
this
kindly
gentleman
took
back
my
message
to
the
duke
who
came
with
pleasure
no
sooner
had
he
entered
the
enclosure
and
cast
his
eyes
upon
my
work
than
he
gave
signs
of
being
greatly
satisfied
then
he
walked
all
round
it
stopping
at
each
of
the
four
points
of
view
exactly
as
the
ripest
expert
would
have
done
afterwards
he
showed
by
nods
and
gestures
of
approval
that
it
pleased
him
but
he
said
no
more
than
this
you
have
only
to
give
a
little
surface
to
your
then
he
turned
to
his
attendants
praising
my
performance
and
saying

model

i
saw

me
greatly

to
gain

that
about
this
time
a
certain
rascal
from
vecchio
called
piermaria
and
surnamed
lo
sbietta
introduced
himself
to
me
he
is

and
being
closely
related
to

the
physician
who
is
now

i
lent
ear
to
his
proposals
the
man
offered
to
sell
me
a
farm
of
his
for
the
term
of
my
natural
life
i
did
not
care
to
go
and
see
it
since
i
wanted
to
complete
the
model
of
my
colossal
neptune
there
was
also
no
reason
why
i
should
visit
the
property
because
sbietta
only
sold
it
to
me
for
the
income
this
he
had
noted
down
at
so
many
bushels
of
grain
so
much
of
wine
oil
standing
corn
chestnuts
and
other
produce
i
reckoned
that
as
the
market
then
ran
these
together
were
worth
something
considerably
over
a
hundred
golden
crowns
in
gold
and
i
paid
him
crowns
which
included
duties
to
the
state
consequently
when
he
left
a
memorandum
written
in
his
own
hand
to
the
effect
that
he
would
always
keep
up
these
products
of
the
farm
in
the
same
values
during
my
lifetime
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
inspect
it
only
i
made
inquiries
to
the
best
of
my
ability
as
to
whether
sbietta
and
his
brother
ser
filippo
were
well
off
enough
to
give
me
good
security
many
persons
of
divers
sorts
who
knew
them
assured
me
that
my
security
was
excellent
we
agreed
to
call
in
ser
pierfrancesco
bertoldi
notary
at
the
mercantanzia
and
at
the
very
first
i
handed
him
memorandum
expecting
that
this
would
be
recited
in
the
deed
but
the
notary
who
drew
it
up
was
so
occupied
with
detailing
boundaries
described
by
sbietta
that
so
far
as
i
can
judge
he
neglected
to
include
in
the
contract
what
the
vendor
had
proposed
to
furnish
while
he
was
writing
i
went
on
working
and
since
it
took
him
several
hours
i
finished
a
good
piece
of
my
head
after
the
contract
was
signed
and
sealed
sbietta
began
to
pay
me
the
most
marked
attentions
which
i
returned
in
like
measure
he
made
me
presents
of
kids
cheese
capons
fresh
curds
and
many
sorts
of
fruits
until
i
began
to
be
almost
ashamed
of
so
much
kindness
in
exchange
for
these
courtesies
i
always
took
him
from
the
inn
to
lodge
with
me
when
he
came
into
florence
often
inviting
a
relative
or
two
who
happened
to
attend
him
on
one
of
these
occasions
he
told
me
with
a
touch
of
pleasantry
that
it
was
really
shameful
for
me
to
have
bought
a
farm
and
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
weeks
not
yet
to
have
left
my
business
for
three
days
in
the
hands
of
my
workpeople
so
as
to
have
come
to
look
at
it
his
wheedling
words
and
ways
induced
me
to
set
off
in
a
bad
hour
for
my
welfare
on
a
visit
to
him
sbietta
received
me
in
his
own
house
with
such
attentions
and
such
honours
as
a
duke
might
covet
his
wife
caressed
me
even
more
than
he
did
and
these
excellent
relations
continued
between
us
until
the
plans
which
he
and
his
brother
ser
filippo
had
in
mind
were
fully
matured
note
what
cellini
means
is
that
sbietta
was
to
work
the
farm
paying
cellini
its
annual
value
it
appears
from
some
particulars
which
follow
that
the
were
to
be
paid
in
kind
note
the
word
which
i
have
translated
may
mean
conditions
ciii
meanwhile
i
did
not
suspend
my
labours
on
the
neptune
which
was
now
quite
blocked
out
upon
an
excellent
system
undiscovered
and
unknown
before
i
used
it
consequently
although
i
knew
i
should
not
get
the
marble
for
the
reasons
above
narrated
i
hoped
to
have
it
soon
completed
and
to
display
it
on
the
piazza
simply
for
my
satisfaction
it
was
a
warm
and
pleasant
season
and
this
together
with
the
attentions
of
those
two
rascals
disposed
me
to
set
out
one
wednesday
which
happened
to
be
a
double
holiday
for
my
at
trespiano
having
spent
some
time
over
an
excellent
lunch
it
was
past
twenty
when
i
reached
vicchio
there
at
the
towngate
i
met
ser
filippo
who
appeared
to
know
already
whither
i
was
bound
he
loaded
me
with
attentions
and
took
me
to
house
where
i
found
that
strumpet
of
a
wife
who
also
overwhelmed
me
with
caresses
i
gave
the
woman
a
straw
hat
of
the
very
finest
texture
the
like
of
which
she
told
me
she
had
never
seen
still
up
to
this
time
sbietta
had
not
put
in
his
appearance
toward
the
end
of
the
afternoon
we
all
sat
down
to
supper
in
excellent
spirits
later
on
they
gave
me
a
well
appointed
bedroom
where
i
went
to
rest
in
a
bed
of
the
most
perfect
cleanliness
both
of
my
servants
according
to
their
rank
were
equally
well
treated
on
the
morrow
when
i
rose
the
same
attentions
were
paid
me
i
went
to
see
my
farm
which
pleased
me
much
and
then
i
had
some
quantities
of
grain
and
other
produce
handed
over
but
when
i
returned
to
vicchio
the
priest
ser
filippo
said
to
me
do
not
be
uneasy
although
you
have
not
found
here
quite
everything
you
had
the
right
to
look
for
yet
put
your
mind
to
rest
it
will
be
amply
made
up
in
the
future
for
you
have
to
deal
with
honest
folk
you
ought
by
the
way
to
know
that
we
have
sent
that
labourer
away
because
he
was
a
the
labourer
in
question
bore
the
name
of
mariano
rosegli
and
this
man
now
kept
frequently
repeating
in
my
ear
well
after
yourself
in
the
end
you
will
discover
which
of
us
here
is
the
greatest
the
when
he
spoke
those
words
smiled
with
an
evil
kind
of
sneer
and
jerked
his
head
as
though
to
say
go
up
there
and
you
will
find
out
for
i
was
to
some
extent
unfavourably
influenced
by
these
hints
yet
far
from
forming
a
conception
of
what
actually
happened
to
me
so
when
i
returned
from
the
farm
which
is
two
miles
distant
from
vicchio
toward
the
alpi
i
met
the
priest
who
was
waiting
for
me
with
his
customary
politeness
we
then
sat
down
together
to
breakfast
it
was
not
so
much
a
dinner
as
an
excellent
collation
afterwards
i
took
a
walk
through
vicchio
the
market
had
just
opened
and
noticed
how
all
the
inhabitants
fixed
their
eyes
upon
me
as
on
something
strange
this
struck
me
particularly
in
the
case
of
a
worthy
old
man
who
has
been
living
for
many
years
at
vicchio
and
whose
wife
bakes
bread
for
sale
he
owns
some
good
property
at
the
distance
of
about
a
mile
however
he
prefers
this
mode
of
life
and
occupies
a
house
which
belongs
to
me
in
the
town
of
vicchio
this
had
been
consigned
to
me
together
with
the
farm
above
mentioned
which
bears
the
name
of
della
fonte
the
worthy
old
man
spoke
as
follows
am
living
in
your
house
and
when
it
falls
due
i
shall
pay
you
your
rent
but
if
you
want
it
earlier
i
will
act
according
to
your
wishes
you
may
reckon
on
never
having
any
disputes
with
while
we
were
thus
talking
i
noticed
that
he
looked
me
hard
in
the
face
which
compelled
me
to
address
him
thus
tell
me
friend
giovanni
why
you
have
more
than
once
stared
at
me
in
that
way
he
replied
am
quite
willing
to
tell
you
if
being
the
man
of
worth
i
take
you
for
you
will
promise
not
to
say
that
i
have
told
i
gave
the
promise
and
he
proceeded
must
know
then
that
that
worthless
priest
ser
filippo
not
many
days
since
went
about
boasting
of
his
brother
cleverness
and
telling
how
he
had
sold
his
farm
to
an
old
man
for
his
lifetime
and
that
the
purchaser
could
hardly
live
the
year
out
you
have
got
mixed
up
with
a
set
of
rogues
therefore
take
heed
to
living
as
long
as
you
are
able
and
keep
your
eyes
open
for
you
have
need
of
it
i
do
not
choose
to
say
note
from
it
appears
that
he
bought
a
farm
at
this
village
of
florence
on
october
in
he
also
purchased
land
there
note
the
alpi
are
high
mountain
pastures
in
the
apennines
civ
during
my
promenade
through
the
market
i
met
giovan
battista
santini
and
he
and
i
were
taken
back
to
supper
by
the
priest
as
i
have
related
above
we
supped
at
the
early
hour
of
twenty
because
i
made
it
known
that
i
meant
to
return
to
trespiano
accordingly
they
made
all
ready
the
wife
of
sbietta
went
bustling
about
in
the
company
of
one
cecchino
buti
their
knave
of
all
work
after
the
salads
had
been
mixed
and
we
were
preparing
to
sit
down
to
table
that
evil
priest
with
a
certain
nasty
sort
of
grin
exclaimed
must
beg
you
to
excuse
me
for
i
can
not
sup
with
you
the
reason
is
that
some
business
of
importance
has
occurred
which
i
must
transact
for
my
brother
sbietta
in
his
absence
i
am
obliged
to
act
for
we
all
begged
him
to
stay
but
could
not
alter
his
determination
so
he
departed
and
we
began
our
supper
after
we
had
eaten
the
salads
on
some
common
platters
and
they
were
preparing
to
serve
the
boiled
meat
each
guest
received
a
porringer
for
himself
santini
who
was
seated
opposite
me
at
table
exclaimed
you
notice
that
the
crockery
they
give
you
is
different
from
the
rest
did
you
ever
see
anything
handsomer
i
answered
that
i
had
not
noticed
it
he
also
prayed
me
to
invite
wife
to
sit
down
with
us
for
she
and
that
cecchino
buti
kept
running
hither
and
thither
in
the
most
extraordinary
fuss
and
hurry
at
last
i
induced
the
woman
to
join
us
when
she
began
to
remonstrate
do
not
like
my
victuals
since
you
eat
so
i
answered
by
praising
the
supper
over
and
over
again
and
saying
that
i
had
never
eaten
better
or
with
heartier
appetite
finally
i
told
her
that
i
had
eaten
quite
enough
i
could
not
imagine
why
she
urged
me
so
persistently
to
eat
after
supper
was
over
and
it
was
past
the
hour
of
i
became
anxious
to
return
to
trespiano
in
order
that
i
might
recommence
my
work
next
morning
in
the
loggia
accordingly
i
bade
farewell
to
all
the
company
and
having
thanked
our
hostess
took
my
leave
i
had
not
gone
three
miles
before
i
felt
as
though
my
stomach
was
on
fire
and
suffered
such
pain
that
it
seemed
a
thousand
years
till
i
arrived
at
trespiano
however
it
pleased
god
that
i
reached
it
after
nightfall
with
great
toil
and
immediately
proceeded
to
my
farm
where
i
went
to
bed
during
the
night
i
got
no
sleep
and
was
constantly
disturbed
by
motions
of
my
bowels
when
day
broke
feeling
an
intense
heat
in
the
rectum
i
looked
eagerly
to
see
what
this
might
mean
and
found
the
cloth
covered
with
blood
then
in
a
moment
i
conceived
that
i
had
eaten
something
poisonous
and
racked
my
brains
to
think
what
it
could
possibly
have
been
it
came
back
to
my
memory
how
wife
had
set
before
me
plates
and
porringers
and
saucers
different
from
the
others
and
how
that
evil
priest
brother
after
giving
himself
such
pains
to
do
me
honour
had
yet
refused
to
sup
with
us
furthermore
i
remembered
what
the
priest
had
said
about
doing
such
a
fine
stroke
of
business
by
the
sale
of
his
farm
to
an
old
man
for
life
who
could
not
be
expected
to
survive
a
year
giovanni
sardella
had
reported
these
words
to
me
all
things
considered
i
made
my
mind
up
that
they
must
have
administered
a
dose
of
sublimate
in
the
sauce
which
was
very
well
made
and
pleasant
to
the
taste
inasmuch
as
sublimate
produces
all
the
symptoms
i
was
suffering
from
now
it
is
my
custom
to
take
but
little
sauce
or
seasoning
with
my
meat
excepting
salt
and
yet
i
had
eaten
two
moderate
mouthfuls
of
that
sauce
because
it
was
so
tasteful
on
further
thinking
i
recollected
how
often
that
wife
of
sbietta
had
teased
me
in
a
hundred
ways
to
partake
more
freely
of
the
sauce
on
these
accounts
i
felt
absolutely
certain
that
they
had
given
me
sublimate
in
that
very
dish
cv
albeit
i
was
suffering
so
severely
i
forced
myself
to
work
upon
my
colossus
in
the
loggia
but
after
a
few
days
i
succumbed
to
the
malady
and
took
to
my
bed
no
sooner
did
the
duchess
hear
that
i
was
ill
than
she
caused
the
execution
of
that
unlucky
marble
to
be
assigned
to
bartolommeo
ammanato
he
sent
word
to
me
through
messer
hellip
living
hellip
street
that
i
might
now
do
what
i
liked
with
my
model
since
he
had
won
the
marble
this
messer
hellip
was
one
of
the
lovers
of
bartolommeo
wife
and
being
the
most
favoured
on
account
of
his
gentle
manners
and
discretion
ammanato
made
things
easy
for
him
there
would
be
much
to
say
upon
this
topic
however
i
do
not
care
to
imitate
his
master
bandinello
who
always
wandered
from
the
subject
in
his
talk
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
told
messenger
i
had
always
imagined
it
would
turn
out
thus
let
the
man
strain
himself
to
the
utmost
in
proof
of
gratitude
to
fortune
for
so
great
a
favour
so
undeservedly
conferred
on
him
by
her
all
this
while
i
stayed
with
sorry
cheer
in
bed
and
was
attended
by
that
most
excellent
man
and
physician
maestro
francesco
da
montevarchi
together
with
him
maestro
raffaello
pilli
undertook
the
surgical
part
of
my
case
forasmuch
as
the
sublimate
had
so
corroded
the
intestines
that
i
was
unable
to
retain
my
motions
when
maestro
francesco
saw
that
the
poison
had
exerted
all
its
strength
being
indeed
insufficient
in
quantity
to
overcome
my
vigorous
constitutions
he
said
one
day
return
thanks
to
god
for
you
have
won
the
battle
have
no
anxiety
since
i
mean
to
cure
you
in
spite
of
the
rogues
who
sought
to
work
your
maestro
raffaello
then
put
in
will
be
one
of
the
finest
and
most
difficult
cures
which
was
ever
heard
of
for
i
can
tell
you
benvenuto
that
you
swallowed
a
good
mouthful
of
thereupon
maestro
francesco
took
him
up
and
said
may
possibly
have
been
some
venomous
i
replied
know
for
certain
what
sort
of
poison
it
was
and
who
gave
it
to
me
upon
which
we
all
were
silent
they
attended
me
more
than
six
full
months
and
i
remained
more
than
a
whole
year
before
i
could
enjoy
my
life
and
vigour
note
what
follows
has
been
so
carefully
erased
possibly
by
own
hand
in
the
autograph
that
it
is
illegible
laura
battiferra
wife
was
a
woman
of
irreproachable
character
whom
cellini
himself
praised
in
a
sonnet
cvi
at
this
time
the
duke
went
to
make
his
triumphal
entry
into
siena
and
ammanato
had
gone
there
some
months
earlier
to
construct
the
arches
a
bastard
of
his
who
stayed
behind
in
the
loggia
removed
the
cloths
with
which
i
kept
my
model
of
neptune
covered
until
it
should
be
finished
as
soon
as
i
knew
this
i
complained
to
signor
don
francesco
the
son
who
was
kindly
disposed
toward
me
and
told
him
how
they
had
disclosed
my
still
imperfect
statue
had
it
been
finished
i
should
not
have
given
the
fact
a
thought
the
prince
replied
with
a
threatening
toss
of
his
head
do
not
mind
your
statue
having
been
uncovered
because
these
men
are
only
working
against
themselves
yet
if
you
want
me
to
have
it
covered
up
i
will
do
so
at
he
added
many
other
words
in
my
honour
before
a
crowd
of
gentlemen
who
were
there
i
then
begged
his
excellency
to
give
me
the
necessary
means
for
finishing
it
saying
that
i
meant
to
make
a
present
of
it
together
with
the
little
model
to
his
highness
he
replied
that
he
gladly
accepted
both
gifts
and
that
he
would
have
all
the
conveniences
i
asked
for
put
at
my
disposal
thus
then
i
fed
upon
this
trifling
mark
of
favour
which
in
fact
proved
the
salvation
of
my
life
for
having
been
overwhelmed
by
so
many
evils
and
such
great
annoyances
all
at
one
fell
swoop
i
felt
my
forces
failing
but
this
little
gleam
of
encouragement
inspired
me
with
some
hope
of
living
note
october
cvii
a
year
had
now
passed
since
i
bought
the
farm
of
della
fonte
from
sbietta
in
addition
to
their
attempt
upon
my
life
by
poisoning
and
their
numerous
robberies
i
noticed
that
the
property
yielded
less
than
half
what
had
been
promised
now
in
addition
to
the
deeds
of
contract
i
had
a
declaration
written
by
own
hand
in
which
he
bound
himself
before
witnesses
to
pay
me
over
the
yearly
income
i
have
mentioned
armed
with
these
documents
i
had
recourse
to
the
lords
counsellors
at
that
time
messer
alfonso
quistello
was
still
alive
and
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
he
sat
upon
the
board
which
included
averardo
serristori
and
federigo
ricci
i
can
not
remember
the
names
of
all
of
them
but
i
know
that
one
of
the
alessandri
was
a
member
suffice
it
to
say
the
counsellors
of
that
session
were
men
of
weight
and
worth
when
i
had
explained
my
cause
to
the
magistracy
they
all
with
one
voice
ruled
that
sbietta
should
give
me
back
my
money
except
federigo
ricci
who
was
then
employing
the
fellow
himself
the
others
unanimously
expressed
sorrow
to
me
that
federigo
ricci
prevented
them
from
despatching
the
affair
averardo
serristori
and
alessandri
in
particular
made
a
tremendous
stir
about
it
but
federigo
managed
to
protect
matters
until
the
magistracy
went
out
of
office
whereupon
serristori
meeting
me
one
morning
after
they
had
come
out
upon
the
piazza
annunziata
cried
aloud
without
the
least
regard
to
consequences
ricci
has
been
so
much
stronger
than
all
of
us
put
together
that
you
have
been
massacred
against
our
i
do
not
intend
to
say
more
upon
this
topic
since
it
would
be
too
offensive
to
the
supreme
authorities
of
state
enough
that
i
was
cruelly
wronged
at
the
will
of
a
rich
citizen
only
because
he
made
use
of
that
cviii
the
duke
was
staying
at
livorno
where
i
went
to
visit
him
in
order
merely
to
obtain
release
from
his
service
now
that
i
felt
my
vigour
returning
and
saw
that
i
was
used
for
nothing
it
pained
me
to
lose
time
which
ought
to
have
been
spent
upon
my
art
i
made
my
mind
up
therefore
went
to
livorno
and
found
my
prince
who
received
me
with
exceeding
graciousness
now
i
stayed
there
several
days
and
went
out
riding
daily
with
his
excellency
consequently
i
had
excellent
opportunities
for
saying
all
i
wanted
since
it
was
the
custom
to
ride
four
miles
out
of
livorno
along
the
to
the
point
where
he
was
erecting
a
little
fort
not
caring
to
be
troubled
with
a
crowd
of
people
he
liked
me
to
converse
with
him
so
then
on
one
of
these
occasions
having
observed
him
pay
me
some
remarkable
attentions
i
entered
into
the
affair
of
sbietta
and
spoke
as
follows
lord
i
should
like
to
narrate
to
your
most
illustrious
excellency
a
very
singular
incident
which
will
explain
why
i
was
prevented
from
finishing
that
clay
model
of
neptune
on
which
i
was
working
in
the
loggia
your
excellency
must
know
that
i
bought
a
farm
for
my
life
from
sbietta
to
cut
the
matter
short
i
related
the
whole
story
in
detail
without
contaminating
truth
with
falsehood
now
when
i
came
to
the
poison
i
remarked
that
if
i
had
ever
proved
an
acceptable
servant
in
the
sight
of
his
most
illustrious
excellency
he
ought
not
to
punish
sbietta
or
those
who
administered
the
poison
but
rather
to
confer
upon
them
some
great
benefit
inasmuch
as
the
poison
was
not
enough
to
kill
me
but
had
exactly
sufficed
to
cleanse
me
of
a
mortal
viscosity
from
which
i
suffered
in
my
stomach
and
intestines
poison
quoth
i
so
well
that
whereas
before
i
took
it
i
had
perhaps
but
three
or
four
years
to
live
i
verily
believe
now
that
it
has
helped
me
to
more
than
twenty
years
by
bettering
my
constitution
for
this
mercy
i
return
thanks
to
god
with
greater
heartiness
than
ever
and
this
proves
that
a
proverb
i
have
sometimes
heard
spoken
is
true
which
runs
as
follows
send
us
evil
that
may
work
us
the
duke
listened
to
my
story
through
more
than
two
miles
of
travel
keeping
his
attention
fixed
and
only
uttering
the
villains
i
said
in
conclusion
that
i
felt
obliged
to
them
and
opened
other
and
more
cheerful
subjects
of
conversation
i
kept
upon
the
for
a
convenient
day
and
when
i
found
him
well
disposed
for
what
i
wanted
i
entreated
his
most
illustrious
excellency
to
dismiss
me
in
a
friendly
spirit
so
that
i
might
not
have
to
waste
the
few
years
in
which
i
should
be
fit
to
do
anything
as
for
the
balance
due
upon
my
perseus
he
might
give
this
to
me
when
he
judged
it
opportune
such
was
the
pith
of
my
discourse
but
i
expanded
it
with
lengthy
compliments
expressing
my
gratitude
toward
his
most
illustrious
excellency
to
all
this
he
made
absolutely
no
answer
but
rather
seemed
to
have
taken
my
communication
on
the
following
day
messer
bartolommeo
concino
one
of
the
secretaries
and
among
the
chiefest
came
to
me
and
said
with
somewhat
of
a
bullying
air
duke
bids
me
tell
you
that
if
you
want
your
dismissal
he
will
grant
it
but
if
you
choose
work
he
will
give
you
plenty
god
grant
you
may
have
the
power
to
execute
all
he
i
replied
that
i
desired
nothing
more
than
work
to
do
and
would
rather
take
it
from
the
duke
than
from
any
man
whatever
in
the
world
whether
they
were
popes
emperors
or
kings
i
should
prefer
to
serve
his
most
illustrious
excellency
for
a
halfpenny
than
any
of
the
rest
of
them
for
a
ducat
he
then
remarked
that
is
your
mind
you
and
he
have
struck
a
bargain
without
the
need
of
further
speech
so
then
go
back
to
florence
and
be
unconcerned
rely
on
the
goodwill
towards
accordingly
i
made
my
way
again
to
florence
note
this
man
was
the
son
of
a
peasant
at
terranuova
in
valdarno
he
acquired
great
wealth
and
honour
at
the
court
of
duke
cosimo
and
was
grandfather
of
the
notorious
maréchal
cix
immediately
after
my
arrival
there
came
to
visit
me
a
certain
raffaellone
scheggia
whose
trade
was
that
of
a
weaver
he
began
thus
benvenuto
i
should
like
to
reconcile
you
with
piermaria
i
replied
that
nobody
could
settle
the
affairs
between
us
except
the
lords
counsellors
in
the
present
court
sbietta
would
not
have
a
federigo
ricci
to
support
him
a
man
willing
for
the
bribe
of
a
couple
of
fatted
kids
without
respect
of
god
or
of
his
honour
to
back
so
infamous
a
cause
and
do
so
vile
a
wrong
to
sacred
justice
when
i
had
uttered
these
words
and
many
others
to
the
like
effect
raffaello
kept
on
blandly
urging
that
it
was
far
better
to
eat
a
thrush
in
peace
than
to
bring
a
fat
capon
to
table
even
though
one
were
quite
sure
to
get
it
after
a
hot
fight
he
further
reminded
me
that
lawsuits
had
a
certain
way
of
dragging
on
and
that
i
could
employ
the
time
far
better
upon
some
masterpiece
of
art
which
would
bring
me
not
only
greater
honour
but
greater
profit
to
boot
i
knew
that
he
was
speaking
the
mere
truth
and
began
to
lend
ear
to
his
arguments
before
long
therefore
we
arranged
the
matter
of
this
way
sbietta
was
to
rent
the
farm
from
me
at
seventy
golden
crowns
in
gold
the
year
during
the
whole
term
of
my
natural
life
but
when
we
came
to
the
contract
which
was
drawn
up
by
ser
giovanni
son
of
ser
matteo
da
falgano
sbietta
objected
that
the
terms
we
had
agreed
on
would
involve
our
paying
the
largest
duties
to
the
revenue
he
was
not
going
to
break
his
word
therefore
we
had
better
draw
the
lease
for
five
years
to
be
renewed
on
the
expiry
of
the
term
he
undertook
to
abide
by
his
promise
to
renew
without
raising
further
litigation
that
rascal
the
priest
his
brother
entered
into
similar
engagements
and
so
the
lease
was
drawn
for
five
years
cx
though
i
want
to
enter
upon
other
topics
and
to
leave
all
this
rascality
alone
awhile
i
am
forced
to
narrate
what
happened
at
the
termination
of
this
five
contract
instead
of
abiding
by
their
promised
word
those
two
rogues
declared
they
meant
to
give
me
up
my
farm
and
would
not
keep
it
any
longer
upon
lease
i
not
unnaturally
complained
but
they
retorted
by
ostentatiously
unfolding
the
deed
and
i
found
myself
without
any
defense
against
their
chicanery
when
it
came
to
this
i
told
them
that
duke
and
prince
of
florence
would
not
suffer
folk
to
be
so
infamously
massacred
in
their
cities
that
menace
worked
so
forcibly
upon
their
minds
that
they
once
more
despatched
raffaello
schegcia
the
same
man
who
negotiated
the
former
arrangement
i
must
add
that
they
professed
their
unwillingness
to
pay
the
same
rent
of
seventy
crowns
as
during
the
five
years
past
while
i
replied
that
i
would
not
take
a
farthing
less
so
then
raffaello
came
to
look
me
up
and
spoke
to
this
effect
benvenuto
you
know
that
i
am
acting
in
your
interest
now
these
men
have
placed
themselves
entirely
in
my
hands
and
he
showed
me
a
writing
to
this
effect
signed
by
them
not
being
aware
that
he
was
their
close
relative
i
thought
he
would
be
an
excellent
arbitrator
and
therefore
placed
myself
also
absolutely
in
his
hands
this
man
of
delicate
honour
then
came
one
evening
about
a
half
hour
after
sunset
in
the
month
of
august
and
induced
me
with
the
strongest
pressure
to
draw
up
the
contract
then
and
there
he
did
so
because
he
knew
that
if
he
waited
till
the
morning
the
deceit
he
wished
to
practise
on
me
must
have
failed
accordingly
the
deed
was
executed
to
the
effect
that
they
were
to
pay
me
a
rent
of
crowns
in
two
installments
during
the
term
of
my
natural
life
notwithstanding
i
rebelled
against
it
and
refused
to
sit
down
quietly
under
the
injustice
all
was
to
no
purpose
raffaello
exhibited
my
signature
and
every
one
took
part
against
me
at
the
same
time
he
went
on
protesting
that
he
acted
altogether
in
my
interest
and
as
my
supporter
neither
the
notary
nor
any
others
who
heard
of
the
affair
knew
that
he
was
a
relative
of
those
two
rogues
so
they
told
me
i
was
in
the
wrong
accordingly
i
was
forced
to
yield
with
the
best
grace
i
could
and
what
i
have
now
to
do
is
to
live
as
long
as
i
can
manage
close
after
these
events
that
is
to
say
in
the
december
of
following
i
made
another
blunder
i
bought
half
of
the
farm
del
poggio
from
them
or
rather
from
sbietta
for
two
hundred
crowns
it
marches
with
my
property
of
la
fonte
our
terms
were
that
the
estate
should
revert
at
the
term
of
three
years
and
i
gave
them
a
lease
of
it
i
did
this
for
the
best
but
i
should
have
to
dilate
too
long
upon
the
topic
were
i
to
enter
into
all
the
rascalities
they
practised
on
me
therefore
i
refer
my
cause
entirely
to
god
knowing
that
he
hath
ever
defended
me
from
those
who
sought
to
do
me
mischief
note
di
moneta
not
note
this
seems
to
be
the
meaning
of
con
riservo
di
tre
anni
cellini
elsewhere
uses
the
equivalent
term
resolutivo
see
tassi
vol
ii
cxi
having
quite
completed
my
crucifix
i
thought
that
if
i
raised
it
some
feet
above
the
ground
it
would
show
better
than
it
did
upon
a
lower
level
after
i
had
done
so
it
produced
a
far
finer
effect
than
even
it
had
made
before
and
i
was
greatly
satisfied
so
then
i
began
to
exhibit
it
to
every
one
who
had
the
mind
to
see
it
as
god
willed
the
duke
and
the
duchess
heard
about
it
on
their
arrival
then
from
pisa
both
their
excellencies
arrived
one
day
quite
unexpectedly
attended
by
all
the
nobles
of
their
court
with
the
sole
purpose
of
inspecting
my
crucifix
they
were
so
much
delighted
that
each
of
these
princes
lavished
endless
praises
on
it
and
all
the
lords
and
gentlefolk
of
their
suites
joined
in
chorus
now
when
i
saw
how
greatly
they
were
taken
with
the
piece
i
began
to
thank
them
with
a
touch
of
humour
saying
that
if
they
had
not
refused
me
the
marble
for
the
neptune
i
should
never
have
undertaken
so
arduous
a
task
the
like
whereof
had
not
been
attempted
by
any
sculptor
before
is
true
i
added
this
crucifix
has
cost
me
hours
of
unimaginable
labour
yet
they
have
been
well
expended
especially
now
when
your
most
illustrious
excellencies
have
bestowed
such
praises
on
it
i
can
not
hope
to
find
possessors
of
it
worthier
than
you
are
therefore
i
gladly
present
it
to
you
as
a
after
speaking
to
this
effect
i
prayed
them
before
they
took
their
leave
to
deign
to
follow
me
into
the
of
my
dwelling
they
rose
at
once
with
genial
assent
left
the
workshop
and
on
entering
the
house
beheld
my
little
model
of
the
neptune
and
the
fountain
which
had
not
yet
been
by
the
duchess
this
struck
her
with
such
force
that
she
raised
a
cry
of
indescribable
astonishment
and
turning
to
the
duke
exclaimed
my
life
i
never
dreamed
it
could
be
part
so
beautiful
the
duke
replied
by
repeating
more
than
once
i
not
tell
you
so
thus
they
continued
talking
together
for
some
while
greatly
in
my
honour
afterwards
the
duchess
called
me
to
her
side
and
when
she
had
uttered
many
expressions
of
praise
which
sounded
like
excuses
they
might
indeed
have
been
construed
into
asking
for
forgiveness
she
told
me
that
she
should
like
me
to
quarry
a
block
of
marble
to
my
taste
and
then
to
execute
the
work
in
reply
to
these
gracious
speeches
i
said
that
if
their
most
illustrious
excellencies
would
provide
me
with
the
necessary
accommodations
i
should
gladly
for
their
sakes
put
my
hand
to
such
an
arduous
undertaking
the
duke
responded
on
the
moment
you
shall
have
all
the
accommodations
you
can
ask
for
and
i
will
myself
give
you
more
besides
which
shall
surpass
them
far
in
with
these
agreeable
words
they
left
me
and
i
remained
highly
satisfied
note
the
duchess
would
not
take
the
crucifix
as
a
gift
the
duke
bought
it
for
fifteen
hundred
golden
crowns
and
transferred
it
to
the
pitti
in
it
was
given
by
the
grand
duke
francesco
in
to
philip
who
placed
it
in
the
escorial
where
it
now
is
cxii
many
weeks
passed
but
of
me
nothing
more
was
spoken
this
neglect
drove
me
half
mad
with
despair
now
about
that
time
the
queen
of
france
sent
messer
baccio
del
bene
to
our
duke
for
a
loan
of
money
which
the
duke
very
graciously
supplied
as
rumour
went
messer
baccio
del
bene
and
i
had
been
intimate
friends
in
former
times
so
when
we
renewed
our
acquaintance
in
florence
we
came
together
with
much
mutual
satisfaction
in
course
of
conversation
he
related
all
the
favours
shown
him
by
his
most
illustrious
excellency
and
asked
me
what
great
works
i
had
in
hand
in
reply
i
narrated
the
whole
story
of
the
neptune
and
the
fountain
and
the
great
wrong
done
me
by
the
duchess
he
responded
by
telling
me
how
her
majesty
of
france
was
most
eager
to
complete
the
monument
of
her
husband
henri
and
how
daniello
da
volterra
had
undertaken
a
great
equestrian
statue
in
bronze
but
the
time
had
already
elapsed
in
which
he
promised
to
perform
it
and
that
a
multitude
of
the
richest
ornaments
were
required
for
the
tomb
if
then
i
liked
to
return
to
france
and
occupy
my
castle
she
would
supply
me
with
all
the
conveniences
i
could
ask
for
provided
only
i
cared
to
enter
her
service
these
proposals
he
made
on
the
part
of
the
queen
i
told
messer
baccio
to
beg
me
from
the
duke
if
his
most
illustrious
excellency
was
satisfied
i
should
very
willingly
return
to
france
he
answered
cheerfully
will
travel
back
together
and
considered
the
affair
settled
accordingly
next
day
in
course
of
conversation
with
the
duke
he
alluded
to
myself
declaring
that
if
his
excellency
had
no
objection
the
queen
would
take
me
into
her
employ
the
duke
replied
without
a
hesitation
ability
in
his
profession
is
known
to
the
whole
world
but
at
the
present
time
he
does
not
care
to
go
on
then
they
touched
on
other
topics
and
upon
the
day
following
i
called
on
messer
baccio
who
reported
what
had
passed
between
them
then
i
lost
all
patience
and
exclaimed
me
his
most
illustrious
excellency
gave
me
nothing
to
do
while
i
was
bringing
to
perfection
one
of
the
most
difficult
ever
executed
in
this
world
and
it
stands
me
in
more
than
two
hundred
crowns
which
i
have
paid
out
of
my
poverty
oh
what
could
i
not
have
done
if
his
excellency
had
but
set
me
to
work
i
tell
you
in
pure
truth
that
they
have
done
me
a
great
wrong
the
gentleman
repeated
to
the
duke
what
i
had
answered
the
duke
told
him
we
were
joking
and
that
he
wanted
me
for
his
own
service
the
result
was
that
in
my
irritation
i
more
than
once
made
up
my
mind
to
make
off
without
asking
leave
however
the
queen
preferred
to
drop
negotiations
in
fear
of
displeasing
the
duke
and
so
i
remained
here
much
to
my
regret
note
this
painter
is
chiefly
famous
for
his
from
the
in
the
church
of
the
trinitŕ
monti
at
rome
he
died
in
cxiii
about
that
time
the
duke
went
on
a
journey
attended
by
all
his
court
and
all
his
sons
except
the
prince
who
was
in
spain
they
travelled
through
the
sienese
maremma
and
by
this
route
he
reached
pisa
the
poison
from
the
bad
air
of
those
marshes
first
attacked
the
cardinal
who
was
taken
with
a
pestilential
fever
after
a
few
days
and
died
at
the
end
of
a
brief
illness
he
was
the
right
eye
handsome
and
good
and
his
loss
was
most
severely
felt
i
allowed
several
days
