preface
to
a
new
edition
of
confessions
of
a
young
man
i
dear
little
book
what
shall
i
say
about
thee
belated
offspring
of
mine
out
of
print
for
twenty
years
what
shall
i
say
in
praise
of
thee
for
twenty
years
i
have
only
seen
thee
in
french
and
in
this
english
text
thou
comest
to
me
like
an
old
love
at
once
a
surprise
and
a
recollection
dear
little
book
i
would
say
nothing
about
thee
if
i
could
help
it
but
a
publisher
pleads
and
no
is
a
churlish
word
so
for
him
i
will
say
that
i
like
thy
prattle
that
while
travelling
in
a
railway
carriage
on
my
way
to
the
country
of
esther
waters
i
passed
my
station
by
and
had
to
hire
a
carriage
and
drive
across
the
downs
like
a
learned
abbé
i
delighted
in
the
confessions
of
this
young
man
a
young
man
a
little
vicious
in
his
who
says
that
his
soul
must
have
been
dipped
in
lethe
so
deeply
that
he
came
into
the
world
without
remembrance
of
previous
existence
he
can
find
no
other
explanation
for
the
fact
that
the
world
always
seems
to
him
more
new
more
wonderful
than
it
did
to
anyone
he
ever
met
on
his
faring
every
wayside
acquaintance
seemed
old
to
this
amazing
young
man
and
himself
seemed
to
himself
the
only
young
thing
in
the
world
am
i
imitating
the
style
of
these
early
writings
a
man
of
letters
who
would
parody
his
early
style
is
no
better
than
the
ancient
who
wears
a
wig
and
reddens
her
cheeks
i
must
turn
to
the
book
to
see
how
far
this
is
true
the
first
thing
i
catch
sight
of
is
some
french
an
astonishing
dedication
written
in
the
form
of
an
epitaph
an
epitaph
upon
myself
for
it
appears
that
part
of
me
was
dead
even
when
i
wrote
confessions
of
a
young
man
the
youngest
have
a
past
and
this
epitaph
dedication
printed
in
capital
letters
informs
me
that
i
have
embalmed
my
past
that
i
have
wrapped
the
dead
in
the
finest
it
would
seem
i
am
a
little
more
difficult
to
please
for
i
perceived
in
the
railway
train
a
certain
coarseness
in
its
tissue
and
here
and
there
a
tangled
thread
i
would
have
wished
for
more
care
for
peu
plus
de
there
is
something
pathetic
in
the
loving
regard
of
the
man
for
the
young
man
coat
i
will
not
say
that
is
a
morbidity
from
which
the
shrink
i
would
set
his
coat
collar
straighter
i
would
sweep
some
specks
from
it
but
can
i
do
aught
for
this
youth
does
he
need
my
supervision
he
was
himself
that
was
his
genius
and
i
sit
at
gaze
my
melancholy
is
like
her
the
ancient
of
whom
i
spoke
just
now
when
she
sits
by
the
fire
in
the
dusk
a
miniature
of
her
past
self
in
her
hand
ii
this
edition
has
not
been
printed
from
old
plates
no
chicanery
of
that
kind
it
has
been
printed
from
new
type
and
it
was
brought
about
by
walter
pater
evocative
letter
it
was
but
i
like
to
think
that
it
was
off
and
on
his
letter
was
sought
for
during
many
years
hunted
for
through
all
sorts
of
portfolios
and
bookcases
but
never
found
until
it
appeared
miraculously
just
as
the
proof
of
my
pater
article
was
being
sent
back
to
the
printer
the
precious
letter
transpired
shall
i
say
transpired
through
a
crack
in
the
old
bookcase
brasenose
college
my
dear
audacious
moore
many
thanks
for
the
confessions
which
i
have
read
with
great
interest
and
admiration
for
your
originality
your
delightful
criticisms
your
aristophanic
joy
or
at
least
enjoyment
in
life
your
unfailing
liveliness
of
course
there
are
many
things
in
the
book
i
do
agree
with
but
then
in
the
case
of
so
satiric
a
book
i
suppose
one
is
hardly
expected
to
agree
or
disagree
what
i
can
not
doubt
is
the
literary
faculty
displayed
thou
in
such
a
questionable
shape
i
feel
inclined
to
say
on
finishing
your
book
shape
morally
i
mean
not
in
reference
to
style
you
speak
of
my
own
work
very
pleasantly
but
my
enjoyment
has
been
independent
of
that
and
still
i
wonder
how
much
you
may
be
losing
both
for
yourself
and
for
your
writings
by
what
in
spite
of
its
gaiety
and
and
genuine
sense
of
the
beauty
of
many
things
i
must
still
call
a
cynical
and
therefore
exclusive
way
of
looking
at
the
world
you
call
it
only
realistic
still
with
sincere
wishes
for
the
future
success
of
your
most
entertaining
very
sincerely
yours
walter
pater
remember
reader
that
this
letter
was
written
by
the
last
great
english
writer
by
the
author
of
imaginary
portraits
the
most
beautiful
of
all
prose
books
i
should
like
to
break
off
and
tell
of
my
delight
in
reading
imaginary
portraits
but
i
have
told
my
delight
elsewhere
go
seek
out
what
i
have
said
in
the
pages
of
the
mall
for
august
for
here
i
am
obliged
to
tell
you
of
myself
i
give
you
pater
letter
for
i
wish
you
to
read
this
book
with
reverence
never
forget
that
pater
admiration
has
made
this
book
a
sacred
book
never
forget
that
my
special
pleasure
in
these
early
pages
was
to
find
that
i
thought
about
pater
twenty
years
ago
as
i
think
about
him
now
and
shall
certainly
think
of
him
till
time
everlasting
world
without
end
i
have
been
accused
of
changing
my
likes
and
dislikes
no
one
has
changed
less
than
i
and
this
book
is
proof
of
my
fidelity
to
my
first
ideas
the
ideas
i
have
followed
all
my
life
are
in
this
book
dear
crescent
moon
rising
in
the
above
the
trees
at
the
end
of
the
village
green
it
was
in
that
ugly
but
village
on
the
south
coast
i
discovered
my
love
of
protestant
england
it
was
on
the
downs
that
the
instinct
of
protestantism
lit
up
in
me
but
when
zola
asked
me
why
i
preferred
protestantism
to
roman
catholicism
i
could
not
answer
him
he
had
promised
to
write
a
preface
for
the
french
translation
of
the
mummer
wife
the
translation
had
to
be
revised
months
and
months
passed
away
and
forgetting
all
about
the
mummer
wife
i
expressed
my
opinion
about
zola
which
had
been
changing
a
little
too
fearlessly
and
in
view
of
my
revolt
he
was
obliged
to
break
his
promise
to
write
a
preface
and
this
must
have
been
a
great
blow
for
he
was
a
man
of
method
to
whom
any
change
of
plan
was
disagreeable
and
unnerving
he
sent
a
letter
asking
me
to
come
to
medan
he
would
talk
to
me
about
the
confessions
well
do
i
remember
going
there
with
dear
alexis
in
the
the
young
corn
six
inches
high
in
the
fields
and
my
delight
in
the
lush
luxuriance
of
the
that
dear
morning
is
remembered
and
the
poor
master
who
reproved
me
a
little
sententiously
is
dead
he
was
sorrowful
in
that
dreadful
room
of
his
fixed
up
with
stained
glass
and
morbid
antiquities
he
lay
on
a
sofa
lecturing
me
till
breakfast
then
i
thought
reproof
was
over
but
after
a
walk
in
the
garden
we
went
upstairs
and
he
began
again
saying
he
was
not
angry
it
is
the
law
of
nature
he
said
for
children
to
devour
their
parents
i
do
not
complain
i
think
he
was
aware
he
was
playing
a
part
his
sofa
was
his
stage
and
he
lay
there
theatrical
as
leo
xi
or
beerbohm
tree
saying
that
the
roman
church
was
an
artistic
church
that
its
rich
externality
and
ceremonial
were
pagan
but
i
think
he
knew
even
then
at
the
back
of
his
mind
that
i
was
right
that
is
why
he
pressed
me
to
give
reasons
for
my
preference
zola
came
to
hate
catholicism
as
much
as
i
and
his
hatred
was
for
the
same
reason
as
mine
we
both
learnt
that
any
religion
which
robs
a
man
of
the
right
of
and
private
judgment
degrades
the
soul
renders
it
lethargic
and
timid
takes
the
edge
off
the
intellect
zola
lived
to
write
that
the
catholic
countries
are
dead
and
the
clergy
are
the
worms
in
the
corpses
the
observation
is
quelconque
i
should
prefer
the
more
interesting
allegation
that
since
the
reformation
no
born
catholic
has
written
a
book
of
literary
value
he
would
have
had
to
concede
that
some
converts
have
written
well
the
convert
still
retains
a
little
of
his
ancient
freedom
some
of
the
intellectual
virility
he
acquired
elsewhere
but
the
born
catholic
is
but
however
we
may
disapprove
of
catholicism
we
can
still
admire
the
convert
cardinal
manning
was
aware
of
the
advantages
of
a
protestant
bringing
up
and
he
often
said
that
he
was
glad
he
had
been
born
a
protestant
his
eminence
was
therefore
of
opinion
that
the
catholic
faith
should
be
reserved
and
exclusively
for
converts
and
in
this
he
showed
his
practical
sense
for
it
is
easy
to
imagine
a
country
prosperous
in
which
all
the
inhabitants
should
be
brought
up
protestants
or
agnostics
and
in
which
conversions
to
rome
are
only
permitted
after
a
certain
age
or
in
clearly
defined
circumstances
there
would
be
something
beyond
mere
practical
wisdom
in
such
an
exquisite
sense
of
the
pathos
of
human
life
and
its
requirements
scapulars
indulgences
and
sacraments
are
needed
by
the
weak
and
the
ageing
sacraments
especially
they
make
you
believe
but
they
stupefy
you
these
words
are
pascal
the
great
light
of
the
catholic
church
iii
my
protestant
sympathies
go
back
very
far
further
back
than
these
confessions
i
find
them
in
a
french
sonnet
crude
and
diffuse
in
versification
of
the
kind
which
finds
favour
with
the
very
young
a
sonnet
which
i
should
not
publish
did
it
not
remind
me
of
two
things
especially
dear
to
me
my
love
of
france
and
protestantism

i
find
not
only
my
protestant
sympathies
in
the
confessions
but
a
proud
agnosticism
and
an
exalted
individualism
which
in
certain
passages
leads
the
reader
to
the
sundered
rocks
about
the
cave
of
zarathoustra
my
book
was
written
before
i
heard
that
splendid
name
before
zarathoustra
was
written
and
the
doctrine
though
hardly
formulated
is
in
the
confessions
as
darwin
is
in
wallace
here
ye
shall
find
me
the
germs
of
all
i
have
written
are
in
the
confessions
esther
waters
and
modern
painting
my
love
of
france
the
country
as
pater
would
say
of
my
instinctive
election
and
all
my
prophecies
manet
degas
whistler
monet
pissaro
all
these
have
come
into
their
inheritance
those
whom
i
brushed
aside
where
are
they
stevenson
so
well
described
as
the
young
man
that
ever
walked
in
the
burlington
arcade
has
slipped
into
nothingness
despite
the
journalists
and
mr
sidney
colvin
batch
of
letters
poor
colvin
he
made
a
mistake
he
should
have
hopped
on
to
pater
were
it
not
for
a
silly
phrase
about
george
eliot
who
surely
was
no
more
than
one
of
those
dull
clever
people
unlit
by
any
ray
of
genius
i
might
say
with
swinburne
i
have
nothing
to
regret
nothing
to
withdraw
maybe
a
few
flippant
remarks
about
my
private
friends
but
to
withdraw
them
would
be
unmanly
unintellectual
and
no
one
may
his
confessions
a
moment
ago
i
wrote
i
have
nothing
to
regret
except
a
silly
phrase
about
george
eliot
i
was
mistaken
there
is
this
preface
if
one
has
succeeded
in
explaining
oneself
in
a
book
a
preface
is
unnecessary
and
if
one
has
failed
to
explain
oneself
in
the
book
it
is
still
more
unnecessary
to
explain
oneself
in
a
preface
george
moore
confessions
of
a
young
man
i
my
soul
so
far
as
i
understand
it
has
very
kindly
taken
colour
and
form
from
the
many
various
modes
of
life
that
and
an
impetuous
temperament
have
forced
me
to
indulge
in
therefore
i
may
say
that
i
am
free
from
original
qualities
defects
tastes
etc
what
is
mine
i
have
acquired
or
to
speak
more
exactly
chance
bestowed
and
still
bestows
upon
me
i
came
into
the
world
apparently
with
a
nature
like
a
smooth
sheet
of
wax
bearing
no
impress
but
capable
of
receiving
any
of
being
moulded
into
all
shapes
nor
am
i
exaggerating
when
i
say
i
think
that
i
might
equally
have
been
a
pharaoh
an
ostler
a
pimp
an
archbishop
and
that
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
duties
of
each
a
certain
measure
of
success
would
have
been
mine
i
have
felt
the
goad
of
many
impulses
i
have
hunted
many
a
trail
when
one
scent
failed
another
was
taken
up
and
pursued
with
the
pertinacity
of
instinct
rather
than
the
fervour
of
a
reasoned
conviction
sometimes
it
is
true
there
came
moments
of
weariness
of
despondency
but
they
were
not
enduring
a
word
spoken
a
book
read
or
yielding
to
the
attraction
of
environment
i
was
soon
off
in
another
direction
forgetful
of
past
failures
intricate
indeed
was
the
labyrinth
of
my
desires
all
lights
were
followed
with
the
same
ardour
all
cries
were
eagerly
responded
to
they
came
from
the
right
they
came
from
the
left
from
every
side
but
one
cry
was
more
persistent
and
as
the
years
passed
i
learned
to
follow
it
with
increasing
vigour
and
my
strayings
grew
fewer
and
the
way
wider
i
was
eleven
years
old
when
i
first
heard
and
obeyed
this
cry
or
shall
i
say
scene
a
great
family
coach
drawn
by
two
powerful
country
horses
lumbers
along
a
narrow
irish
road
the
signs
long
ranges
of
blue
mountains
the
streak
of
bog
the
rotting
cabin
the
flock
of
plover
rising
from
the
desolate
water
inside
the
coach
there
are
two
children
they
are
smart
with
new
jackets
and
neckties
their
faces
are
pale
with
sleep
and
the
rolling
of
the
coach
makes
them
feel
a
little
sick
it
is
seven
in
the
morning
opposite
the
children
are
their
parents
and
they
are
talking
of
a
novel
the
world
is
reading
did
lady
audley
murder
her
husband
lady
audley
what
a
beautiful
name
and
she
who
is
a
slender
pale
woman
killed
her
husband
such
thoughts
flash
through
the
boy
mind
his
imagination
is
stirred
and
quickened
and
he
begs
for
an
explanation
the
coach
lumbers
along
it
arrives
at
its
destination
and
lady
audley
is
forgotten
in
the
delight
of
tearing
down
fruit
trees
and
killing
a
cat
but
when
we
returned
home
i
took
the
first
opportunity
of
stealing
the
novel
in
question
i
read
it
eagerly
passionately
vehemently
i
read
its
successor
and
its
successor
i
read
until
i
came
to
a
book
called
doctors
a
lady
who
loved
shelley
and
byron
there
was
magic
there
was
revelation
in
the
name
and
shelley
became
my
soul
divinity
why
did
i
love
shelley
why
was
i
not
attracted
to
byron
i
can
not
say
shelley
oh
that
crystal
name
and
his
poetry
also
crystalline
i
must
see
it
i
must
know
him
escaping
from
the
schoolroom
i
ransacked
the
library
and
at
last
my
ardour
was
rewarded
the
book
a
small
pocket
edition
in
red
boards
no
doubt
long
out
of
print
opened
at
the
sensitive
plant
was
i
disappointed
i
think
i
had
expected
to
understand
better
but
i
had
no
difficulty
in
assuming
that
i
was
satisfied
and
delighted
and
henceforth
the
little
volume
never
left
my
pocket
and
i
read
the
dazzling
stanzas
by
the
shores
of
a
pale
green
irish
lake
comprehending
little
and
loving
a
great
deal
byron
too
was
often
with
me
and
these
poets
were
the
ripening
influence
of
years
otherwise
merely
nervous
and
boisterous
and
my
poets
were
taken
to
school
because
it
pleased
me
to
read
queen
mab
and
cain
amid
the
priests
and
ignorance
of
a
hateful
roman
catholic
college
and
there
my
poets
saved
me
from
intellectual
savagery
for
i
was
incapable
at
that
time
of
learning
anything
what
determined
and
incorrigible
idleness
i
used
to
gaze
fondly
on
a
book
holding
my
head
between
my
hands
and
allow
my
thoughts
to
wander
far
into
dreams
and
thin
imaginings
neither
latin
nor
greek
nor
french
nor
history
nor
english
composition
could
i
learn
unless
indeed
my
curiosity
or
personal
interest
was
excited
then
i
made
rapid
strides
in
that
branch
of
knowledge
to
which
my
attention
was
directed
a
mind
hitherto
dark
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
clear
and
it
remained
clear
and
bright
enough
so
long
as
passion
was
in
me
but
as
it
died
so
the
mind
clouded
and
recoiled
to
its
original
obtuseness
could
and
were
in
my
case
curiously
involved
nor
have
i
in
this
respect
ever
been
able
to
correct
my
natural
temperament
i
have
always
remained
powerless
to
do
anything
unless
moved
by
a
powerful
desire
the
natural
end
to
such
schooldays
as
mine
was
expulsion
i
was
expelled
when
i
was
sixteen
for
idleness
and
general
worthlessness
i
returned
to
a
wild
country
home
where
i
found
my
father
engaged
in
training
racehorses
for
a
nature
of
such
intense
vitality
as
mine
an
ambition
an
aspiration
of
some
sort
was
necessary
and
i
now
as
i
have
often
done
since
accepted
the
first
ideal
to
hand
in
this
instance
it
was
the
i
was
given
a
hunter
i
rode
to
hounds
every
week
i
rode
gallops
every
morning
i
read
the
racing
calendar
latest
betting
and
looked
forward
with
enthusiasm
to
the
day
when
i
should
be
known
as
a
successful
steeplechase
rider
to
ride
the
winner
of
the
liverpool
seemed
to
me
a
final
achievement
and
glory
and
had
not
accident
intervened
it
is
very
possible
that
i
might
have
succeeded
in
carrying
off
if
not
the
meditated
honour
something
scarcely
inferior
such
as
alas
i
can
not
now
recall
the
name
of
a
race
of
the
necessary
value
and
importance
about
this
time
my
father
was
elected
member
of
parliament
our
home
was
broken
up
and
we
went
to
london
but
an
ideal
set
up
on
its
pedestal
is
not
easily
displaced
and
i
persevered
in
my
love
despite
the
poor
promises
london
life
held
out
for
its
ultimate
attainment
and
surreptitiously
i
continued
to
nourish
it
with
small
bets
made
in
a
small
tobacconist
well
do
i
remember
that
shop
the
proprietor
his
the
cheap
cigars
along
the
counter
the
nondescript
who
leaned
his
evening
away
against
the
counter
and
was
supposed
to
know
some
one
who
knew
lord
footman
and
the
great
man
often
spoken
of
but
rarely
seen
he
who
made
a
pound
book
on
the
derby
and
the
constant
coming
and
going
of
the
cabmen
half
an
ounce
of
shag
sir
i
was
then
at
a
military
tutor
in
the
euston
road
for
in
answer
to
my
father
question
as
to
what
occupation
i
intended
to
pursue
i
had
consented
to
enter
the
army
in
my
heart
i
knew
that
when
it
came
to
the
point
i
should
refuse
the
idea
of
military
discipline
was
very
repugnant
and
the
possibility
of
an
anonymous
death
on
a
could
not
be
accepted
by
so
a
youth
by
one
so
full
of
his
own
personality
i
said
yes
to
my
father
because
the
moral
courage
to
say
no
was
lacking
and
i
put
my
trust
in
the
future
as
well
i
might
for
a
fair
prospect
of
idleness
lay
before
me
and
the
chance
of
my
passing
any
examination
was
indeed
remote
in
london
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
great
blonde
man
who
talked
incessantly
about
beautiful
women
and
painted
them
sometimes
larger
than
life
in
somnolent
attitudes
and
luxurious
tints
his
studio
was
a
welcome
contrast
to
the
spitting
and
betting
of
the
tobacco
shop
his
pictures
improvisations
devoid
of
skill
and
indeed
of
artistic
perception
save
a
certain
sentiment
for
the
grand
and
noble
filled
me
with
wonderment
and
awe
how
jolly
it
would
be
to
be
a
painter
i
once
said
quite
involuntarily
why
would
you
like
to
be
a
painter
he
asked
abruptly
i
laughed
not
suspecting
that
i
had
the
slightest
gift
as
indeed
was
the
case
but
the
idea
remained
in
my
mind
and
soon
after
i
began
to
make
sketches
in
the
streets
and
theatres
my
attempts
were
not
very
successful
but
they
encouraged
me
to
tell
my
father
that
i
would
go
to
the
military
tutor
no
more
and
he
allowed
me
to
enter
the
kensington
museum
as
an
art
student
there
of
course
i
learned
nothing
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
art
merely
i
had
much
better
have
continued
my
sketches
in
the
streets
but
the
museum
was
a
beautiful
and
beneficent
influence
and
one
that
applied
marvellously
well
to
the
besetting
danger
of
the
moment
for
in
the
galleries
i
met
young
men
who
spoke
of
other
things
than
betting
and
steeplechase
riding
who
i
remember
it
was
clear
to
me
then
looked
to
a
higher
ideal
than
mine
breathed
a
purer
atmosphere
of
thought
than
i
and
then
the
sweet
white
peace
of
antiquity
the
great
calm
gaze
that
is
not
sadness
nor
joy
but
something
that
we
know
not
of
which
is
lost
to
the
world
for
ever
but
if
you
want
to
be
a
painter
you
must
go
to
france
france
is
the
only
school
of
art
i
must
again
call
attention
to
the
phenomenon
of
that
is
to
say
words
heard
in
an
quarter
that
without
any
appeal
to
our
reason
impel
belief
france
the
word
rang
in
my
ears
and
gleamed
in
my
eyes
france
all
my
senses
sprang
from
sleep
like
a
crew
when
the
man
on
the
cries
land
ahead
instantly
i
knew
i
should
that
i
must
go
to
france
that
i
would
live
there
that
i
would
become
as
a
frenchman
i
knew
not
when
nor
how
but
i
knew
i
should
go
to
france
so
my
youth
ran
into
manhood
finding
its
way
from
rock
to
rock
like
a
rivulet
gathering
strength
at
each
leap
one
day
my
father
was
suddenly
called
to
ireland
a
few
days
after
a
telegram
came
and
my
mother
read
that
we
were
required
at
his
bedside
we
journeyed
over
land
and
sea
and
on
a
bleak
country
road
one
winter
evening
a
man
approached
us
and
i
heard
him
say
that
all
was
over
that
my
father
was
dead
i
loved
my
father
i
burst
into
tears
and
yet
my
soul
said
i
am
glad
the
thought
came
unbidden
undesired
and
i
turned
aside
shocked
at
the
sight
it
afforded
of
my
soul
o
my
father
i
who
love
and
reverence
nothing
else
love
and
reverence
thee
thou
art
the
one
pure
image
in
my
mind
the
one
true
affection
that
life
has
not
broken
or
soiled
i
remember
thy
voice
and
thy
kind
happy
ways
all
i
have
of
worldly
goods
and
native
wit
i
received
from
thee
and
was
it
i
who
was
glad
no
it
was
not
i
i
had
no
concern
in
the
thought
that
then
fell
upon
me
unbidden
and
undesired
my
individual
voice
can
give
you
but
praise
and
loving
words
and
the
voice
that
said
i
am
glad
was
not
my
voice
but
that
of
the
will
to
live
which
we
inherit
from
elemental
dust
through
countless
generations
terrible
and
imperative
is
the
voice
of
the
will
to
live
let
him
who
is
innocent
cast
the
first
stone
terrible
is
the
day
when
each
sees
his
soul
naked
stripped
of
all
veil
that
dear
soul
which
he
can
not
change
or
discard
and
which
is
so
irreparably
his
my
father
death
freed
me
and
i
sprang
like
a
loosened
bough
up
to
the
light
his
death
gave
me
power
to
create
myself
that
is
to
say
to
create
a
complete
and
absolute
self
out
of
the
partial
self
which
was
all
that
the
restraint
of
home
had
permitted
this
future
self
this
ideal
george
moore
beckoned
me
lured
like
a
ghost
and
as
i
followed
the
funeral
the
question
would
i
sacrifice
this
ghostly
self
if
by
so
doing
i
should
bring
my
father
back
presented
itself
without
intermission
and
i
shrank
horrified
at
the
answer
which
i
could
not
crush
out
of
mind
now
my
life
was
like
a
garden
in
the
emotive
torpor
of
spring
now
my
life
was
like
a
flower
conscious
of
the
light
money
was
placed
in
my
hands
and
i
divined
all
it
represented
before
me
the
crystal
lake
the
distant
mountains
the
swaying
woods
said
but
one
word
and
that
word
was
self
not
the
self
that
was
then
mine
but
the
self
on
whose
creation
i
was
enthusiastically
determined
but
i
felt
like
a
murderer
when
i
turned
to
leave
the
place
which
i
had
so
suddenly
and
i
could
not
but
think
unjustly
become
possessed
of
and
now
as
i
probe
this
poignant
psychological
moment
i
find
that
although
i
perfectly
well
realised
that
all
pleasures
were
then
in
my
reach
women
elegant
dress
theatres
and
i
hardly
thought
at
all
of
them
and
much
more
of
certain
drawings
from
the
plaster
cast
i
would
be
an
artist
more
than
ever
i
was
determined
to
be
an
artist
and
my
brain
was
made
of
this
desire
as
i
journeyed
as
fast
as
railway
and
steamboat
could
take
me
to
london
no
further
trammels
no
further
need
of
being
a
soldier
of
being
anything
but
myself
eighteen
with
life
and
france
before
me
but
the
spirit
did
not
move
me
yet
to
leave
home
i
would
feel
the
pulse
of
life
at
home
before
i
felt
it
abroad
i
would
hire
a
studio
a
studio
tapestries
smoke
models
conversations
but
here
it
is
difficult
not
to
convey
a
false
impression
i
fain
would
show
my
soul
in
these
pages
like
a
face
in
a
pool
of
clear
water
and
although
my
studio
was
in
truth
no
more
than
an
amusement
and
a
means
of
effectually
throwing
over
all
restraint
i
did
not
view
it
at
all
in
this
light
my
love
of
art
was
very
genuine
and
the
tobacconist
was
now
as
nothing
and
a
certain
botticelli
in
the
national
gallery
held
me
in
tether
and
when
i
look
back
and
consider
the
past
i
am
forced
to
admit
that
i
might
have
grown
up
in
less
fortunate
circumstances
for
even
the
studio
with
its
dissipations
and
they
were
many
was
not
unserviceable
it
developed
the
natural
man
who
educates
himself
who
allows
his
mind
to
grow
and
ripen
under
the
sun
and
wind
of
modern
life
in
contradistinction
to
the
university
man
who
is
fed
upon
the
dust
of
ages
and
after
a
formula
which
has
been
composed
to
suit
the
requirements
of
the
average
human
being
nor
was
my
reading
at
this
time
so
limited
as
might
be
expected
from
the
foregoing
the
study
of
shelley
poetry
had
led
me
to
read
very
nearly
all
the
english
lyric
poets
shelley
atheism
had
led
me
to
read
kant
spinoza
godwin
darwin
and
mill
so
it
will
be
understood
that
shelley
not
only
gave
me
my
first
soul
but
led
all
its
first
flights
but
i
do
not
think
that
if
shelley
had
been
no
more
than
a
poet
notwithstanding
my
very
genuine
love
of
verse
he
would
have
gained
such
influence
in
my
youthful
sympathies
but
shelley
dreamed
in
metaphysics
very
thin
dreaming
if
you
will
but
just
such
thin
dreaming
as
i
could
follow
was
there
or
was
there
not
a
god
and
for
many
years
i
could
not
dismiss
as
parcel
of
the
world
folly
this
question
and
i
sought
a
solution
inclining
towards
atheism
for
it
was
natural
in
me
to
revere
nothing
and
to
oppose
the
routine
of
daily
thought
and
i
was
but
sixteen
when
i
resolved
to
tell
my
mother
that
i
must
decline
to
believe
any
longer
in
a
god
she
was
leaning
against
the
in
the
i
expected
to
paralyse
the
household
with
the
news
but
although
a
religious
woman
my
mother
did
not
seem
in
the
least
frightened
she
only
said
i
am
very
sorry
george
it
is
so
i
was
deeply
shocked
at
her
indifference
finding
music
and
atheism
in
poetry
i
cared
little
for
novels
scott
seemed
to
me
on
a
par
with
burke
speeches
that
is
to
say
too
impersonal
for
my
very
personal
taste
dickens
i
knew
by
heart
and
i
thought
his
greatest
achievement
thackeray
left
no
deep
impression
on
my
mind
in
no
way
did
he
hold
my
thoughts
he
was
not
picturesque
like
dickens
and
i
was
at
that
time
curiously
eager
for
some
adequate
philosophy
of
life
and
his
social
satire
seemed
very
small
beer
indeed
i
was
really
young
i
hungered
after
great
truths
adam
bede
the
rise
and
influence
of
rationalism
the
history
of
were
momentous
events
in
my
life
but
i
loved
life
better
than
books
and
very
curiously
my
studies
and
my
pleasures
kept
pace
stepping
together
like
a
pair
of
carriage
horses
while
i
was
waiting
for
my
coach
to
take
a
party
of
and
to
the
derby
i
would
read
a
chapter
of
kant
and
i
often
took
the
book
away
with
me
in
my
pocket
and
i
cultivated
with
care
the
acquaintance
of
a
neighbour
who
had
taken
the
globe
theatre
for
the
purpose
of
producing
offenbach
operas
bouquets
stalls
rings
delighted
me
i
was
not
dissipated
but
i
loved
the
abnormal
i
loved
to
spend
on
scent
and
toilette
as
much
as
would
keep
a
poor
man
family
in
affluence
for
ten
months
and
i
smiled
at
the
fashionable
sunlight
in
the
park
the
dusty
cavalcades
and
i
loved
to
shock
my
friends
by
bowing
to
those
whom
i
should
not
bow
to
above
all
the
life
of
the
theatres
that
life
of
raw
gaslight
whitewashed
walls
of
light
doggerel
verse
slangy
polkas
and
waltzes
interested
me
beyond
legitimate
measure
so
curious
and
unreal
did
it
seem
i
lived
at
home
but
dined
daily
at
a
fashionable
restaurant
at
eight
i
was
at
the
theatre
nodding
familiarly
to
the
doorkeeper
i
passed
up
the
long
passage
to
the
stage
afterwards
supper
cremorne
and
the
argyle
rooms
were
my
favourite
haunts
my
mother
suffered
and
expected
ruin
for
i
took
no
trouble
to
conceal
anything
i
boasted
of
dissipations
but
there
was
no
need
to
fear
for
i
was
naturally
endowed
with
a
very
clear
sense
of
i
neither
betted
nor
drank
nor
contracted
debts
nor
a
secret
marriage
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
i
was
a
model
young
man
indeed
and
when
i
returned
home
about
four
in
the
morning
i
watched
the
pale
moon
setting
and
repeating
some
verses
of
shelley
i
thought
how
i
should
go
to
paris
when
i
was
of
age
and
study
painting
ii
at
last
the
day
came
and
with
several
trunks
and
boxes
full
of
clothes
books
and
pictures
i
started
accompanied
by
an
english
valet
for
paris
and
art
we
all
know
the
great
grey
and
melancholy
gare
du
nord
at
six
in
the
morning
and
the
miserable
carriages
and
the
tall
haggard
city
pale
sloppy
yellow
houses
an
oppressive
absence
of
colour
a
peculiar
bleakness
in
the
streets
the
hurries
down
the
asphalte
to
market
a
dreadful
de
with
a
napkin
tied
round
his
throat
moves
about
some
chairs
so
decrepit
and
so
solitary
that
it
seems
impossible
to
imagine
a
human
being
sitting
there
where
are
the
boulevards
where
are
the
champs
elysées
i
asked
myself
and
feeling
bound
to
apologise
for
the
appearance
of
the
city
i
explained
to
my
valet
that
we
were
passing
through
some
and
returned
to
the
study
of
a
french
vocabulary
nevertheless
when
the
time
came
to
formulate
a
demand
for
rooms
hot
water
and
a
fire
i
broke
down
and
the
proprietress
of
the
hotel
who
spoke
english
had
to
be
sent
for
my
plans
so
far
as
i
had
any
were
to
enter
the
beaux
arts
studio
for
preference
for
i
had
then
an
intense
and
profound
admiration
for
that
painter
work
i
did
not
think
much
of
the
application
i
was
told
i
should
have
to
make
at
the
embassy
my
thoughts
were
fixed
on
the
master
and
my
one
desire
was
to
see
him
to
see
him
was
easy
to
speak
to
him
was
another
matter
and
i
had
to
wait
three
weeks
until
i
could
hold
a
conversation
in
french
how
i
achieved
this
feat
i
can
not
say
i
never
opened
a
book
i
know
nor
is
it
agreeable
to
think
what
my
language
must
have
been
like
like
nothing
ever
heard
under
god
sky
before
probably
it
was
however
sufficient
to
waste
a
good
hour
of
the
painter
time
i
told
him
of
my
artistic
sympathies
what
pictures
i
had
seen
of
his
in
london
and
how
much
pleased
i
was
with
those
then
in
his
studio
he
went
through
the
ordeal
without
flinching
he
said
he
would
be
glad
to
have
me
as
a
pupil
but
life
in
the
beaux
arts
is
rough
coarse
and
rowdy
the
model
sits
only
three
times
a
week
the
other
days
we
worked
from
the
plaster
cast
and
to
be
there
by
seven
in
the
morning
required
so
painful
an
effort
of
will
that
i
glanced
in
terror
down
the
dim
and
grey
perspective
of
early
risings
that
awaited
me
then
demoralised
by
the
lassitude
of
sunday
i
told
my
valet
on
monday
morning
to
leave
the
room
that
i
would
return
to
the
beaux
arts
no
more
i
felt
humiliated
at
my
own
weakness
for
much
hope
had
been
centred
in
that
academy
and
i
knew
no
other
day
after
day
i
walked
up
and
down
the
boulevards
studying
the
photographs
of
the
pictures
thinking
of
what
my
next
move
should
be
i
had
never
forgotten
my
father
showing
me
one
day
when
he
was
shaving
three
photographs
from
pictures
they
were
by
an
artist
called
sevres
my
father
liked
the
slenderer
figure
but
i
liked
the
corpulent
the
venus
standing
at
the
corner
of
a
wood
pouring
wine
into
a
goblet
while
cupid
from
behind
her
knees
drew
his
bow
and
shot
the
doves
that
flew
from
glistening
poplar
trees
the
beauty
of
this
woman
and
what
her
beauty
must
be
in
the
life
of
the
painter
had
inspired
many
a
reverie
and
i
had
concluded
this
conclusion
being
of
all
others
most
sympathetic
to
me
that
she
was
his
very
beautiful
mistress
that
they
lived
in
a
picturesque
pavilion
in
the
midst
of
a
shady
garden
full
of
birds
and
tall
flowers
i
had
often
imagined
her
walking
there
at
dressed
in
white
muslin
with
wide
sleeves
open
to
the
elbow
scattering
grain
from
a
silver
plate
to
the
proud
pigeons
that
strutted
about
her
slippered
feet
and
fluttered
to
her
hand
i
had
dreamed
of
seeing
that
woman
as
i
rode
racehorses
on
wild
irish
plains
of
being
loved
by
her
in
london
i
had
dreamed
of
becoming
sevres
pupil
what
coming
and
going
what
inquiries
what
difficulties
arose
at
last
i
was
advised
to
go
to
the
exposition
aux
champs
elysée
and
seek
his
address
in
the
catalogue
i
did
so
and
while
the
copied
out
the
address
for
me
i
chased
his
tame
magpie
that
hopped
about
one
of
the
angles
of
the
great
building
the
reader
smiles
i
was
a
childish
boy
of
who
knew
nothing
and
to
whom
the
world
was
astonishingly
new
doubtless
before
my
soul
was
given
to
me
it
had
been
plunged
deep
in
lethe
and
so
an
almost
virgin
man
i
stood
in
front
of
a
virgin
world
engin
is
not
far
from
paris
and
the
french
country
seemed
to
me
like
a
tall
green
poplars
and
green
river
banks
and
a
little
lake
reflecting
the
foliage
and
the
stems
of
sapling
oak
and
pine
just
as
in
the
pictures
the
driver
pointed
with
his
whip
and
i
saw
a
high
garden
wall
shadowed
with
young
trees
and
a
tall
loose
iron
gate
as
i
walked
up
the
gravel
path
i
looked
for
the
beautiful
mistress
who
dressed
in
muslin
with
sleeves
open
at
the
elbow
should
feed
pigeons
from
a
silver
plate
of
venus
and
the
does
sevres
caught
me
looking
at
it
and
hoping
his
mistress
might
appear
i
prolonged
the
conversation
till
a
tardy
sense
of
the
value
of
his
time
forced
me
to
bring
it
to
a
close
and
as
i
passed
down
the
green
garden
with
him
i
scanned
hopefully
every
nook
fancying
i
should
see
her
reading
and
that
she
would
raise
her
eyes
as
i
passed
looking
back
through
the
years
it
seems
to
me
that
i
did
catch
sight
of
a
white
dress
behind
a
trellis
but
that
dress
might
have
been
his
daughter
even
his
wife
i
only
know
that
i
did
not
discover
sevres
mistress
that
day
nor
any
other
day
i
never
saw
him
again
now
the
earth
is
over
him
as
rossetti
would
say
and
all
the
reveries
that
the
photographs
had
inspired
resulted
in
nothing
mere
childish
sensualities
i
returned
to
engin
with
my
taciturn
valet
but
he
showed
no
enthusiasm
on
the
subject
of
engin
i
saw
he
was
sighing
after
beef
beer
and
a
wife
and
was
but
little
disposed
to
settle
in
this
french
suburb
we
were
both
very
much
alone
in
paris
in
the
evenings
i
allowed
him
to
smoke
his
clay
in
my
room
and
in
an
astounding
brogue
he
counselled
me
to
return
to
my
mother
but
i
would
not
listen
and
one
day
on
the
boulevards
i
was
stricken
with
the
art
of
jules
lefebvre
true
it
is
that
i
saw
it
was
wanting
in
that
tender
grace
which
i
am
forced
to
admit
even
now
saturated
though
i
now
am
with
the
æsthetics
of
different
schools
is
inherent
in
cabanel
work
but
at
the
time
i
am
writing
of
my
nature
was
too
young
and
mobile
to
resist
the
conventional
attractiveness
of
nude
figures
indolent
attitudes
long
hair
slender
hips
and
hands
and
i
accepted
jules
lefebvre
wholly
and
unconditionally
he
hesitated
however
when
i
asked
to
be
taken
as
a
private
pupil
but
he
wrote
out
the
address
of
a
studio
where
he
gave
instruction
every
tuesday
morning
this
was
even
more
to
my
taste
for
i
had
an
instinctive
liking
for
frenchmen
and
was
anxious
to
see
as
much
of
them
as
possible
the
studio
was
perched
high
up
in
the
passage
des
panoramas
there
i
found
julien
a
typical
meridional
the
large
stomach
the
dark
eyes
crafty
and
watchful
the
seductively
mendacious
manner
the
sensual
mind
we
made
friends
at
once
he
consciously
making
use
of
me
i
unconsciously
making
use
of
him
to
him
my
forty
francs
a
subscription
were
a
godsend
nor
were
my
invitations
to
dinner
and
to
the
theatre
to
be
disdained
i
was
curious
odd
quaint
to
be
sure
it
was
a
little
tiresome
to
have
to
put
up
with
a
talkative
person
whose
knowledge
of
the
french
language
had
been
acquired
in
three
months
but
the
dinners
were
good
no
doubt
julien
reasoned
so
i
did
not
reason
at
all
i
felt
this
crafty
clever
man
of
the
world
was
necessary
to
me
i
had
never
met
such
a
man
before
and
all
my
curiosity
was
awake
he
spoke
of
art
and
literature
of
the
world
and
the
flesh
he
told
me
of
the
books
he
had
read
he
narrated
thrilling
incidents
in
his
own
life
and
the
moral
reflections
with
which
he
sprinkled
his
conversation
i
thought
very
striking
like
every
young
man
of
twenty
i
was
on
the
for
something
to
set
up
that
would
do
duty
for
an
ideal
the
world
was
to
me
at
this
time
what
a
had
been
fifteen
years
before
everything
was
spick
and
span
and
every
illusion
was
set
out
straight
and
smart
in
new
paint
and
gilding
but
julien
kept
me
at
a
distance
and
the
rare
occasions
when
he
favoured
me
with
his
society
only
served
to
prepare
my
mind
for
the
friendship
which
awaited
me
and
which
was
destined
to
absorb
some
years
of
my
life
in
the
studio
there
were
some
eighteen
or
twenty
young
men
and
among
these
there
were
some
four
or
five
from
whom
i
could
learn
there
were
also
some
eight
or
nine
young
english
girls
we
sat
round
in
a
circle
and
drew
from
the
model
and
this
reversal
of
all
the
world
opinions
and
prejudices
was
to
me
singularly
delightful
i
loved
the
sense
of
unreality
that
the
exceptional
nature
of
our
life
in
this
studio
conveyed
besides
the
women
themselves
were
young
and
interesting
and
were
therefore
one
of
the
charms
of
the
place
giving
as
they
did
that
sense
of
sex
which
is
so
subtle
a
mental
pleasure
and
which
is
in
its
outward
aspect
so
interesting
to
the
eye
the
gowns
the
hair
lifted
showing
the
neck
the
earrings
the
sleeves
open
at
the
elbow
though
all
this
was
very
dear
to
me
i
did
not
fall
in
love
but
he
who
escapes
a
woman
dominion
generally
comes
under
the
sway
of
some
friend
who
ever
exerts
a
strange
attractiveness
and
fosters
a
sort
of
dependency
that
is
not
healthful
or
valid
and
although
i
look
back
with
undiminished
delight
on
the
friendship
i
contracted
about
this
time
a
friendship
which
permeated
and
added
to
my
life
i
am
nevertheless
forced
to
recognise
that
however
suitable
it
may
have
been
in
my
special
case
in
the
majority
of
instances
it
would
have
proved
but
a
shipwrecking
reef
on
which
a
young
man
life
would
have
gone
to
pieces
what
saved
me
was
the
intensity
of
my
passion
for
art
and
a
moral
revolt
against
any
action
that
i
thought
could
or
would
definitely
compromise
me
in
that
direction
i
was
willing
to
stray
a
little
from
my
path
but
never
further
than
a
single
step
which
i
could
retrace
when
i
pleased
one
day
i
raised
my
eyes
and
saw
there
was
a
in
the
studio
and
to
my
surprise
for
he
was
fashionably
dressed
and
my
experience
had
not
led
me
to
believe
in
the
marriage
of
genius
and
clothes
he
was
painting
very
well
indeed
his
shoulders
were
beautiful
and
broad
a
long
neck
a
tiny
head
a
narrow
thin
face
and
large
eyes
full
of
intelligence
and
fascination
and
although
he
could
not
have
been
working
more
than
an
hour
he
had
already
sketched
in
his
figure
with
all
the
surroundings
screens
lamps
stoves
etc
i
was
deeply
interested
i
asked
the
young
lady
next
me
if
she
knew
who
he
was
she
could
give
me
no
information
but
at
four
there
was
a
general
exodus
from
the
studio
and
we
adjourned
to
a
neighbouring
to
drink
beer
the
way
led
through
a
narrow
passage
and
as
we
stooped
under
an
archway
the
young
man
marshall
was
his
name
spoke
to
me
in
english
yes
we
had
met
before
we
had
exchanged
a
few
words
in
studio
the
great
blonde
man
whose
improvisations
had
awakened
aspiration
in
me
the
usual
reflections
on
the
chances
of
life
were
of
course
made
and
then
followed
the
inevitable
will
you
dine
with
me
marshall
thought
the
following
day
would
suit
him
better
but
i
was
very
pressing
he
offered
to
meet
me
at
my
hotel
or
would
i
come
with
him
to
his
rooms
and
he
would
show
me
some
pictures
some
trifles
he
had
brought
up
from
the
country
nothing
would
please
me
better
we
got
into
a
cab
then
every
moment
revealed
new
qualities
new
superiorities
in
my
friend
not
only
was
he
tall
strong
handsome
and
beautifully
dressed
infinitely
better
dressed
than
myself
but
he
could
talk
french
like
a
native
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
for
he
was
born
in
brussels
and
had
lived
there
all
his
life
but
the
accident
of
birth
rather
stimulated
than
calmed
my
erubescent
admiration
he
spoke
of
and
he
was
clearly
on
familiar
terms
with
the
fashionable
restaurants
and
actresses
he
stopped
at
a
hairdresser
to
have
his
hair
curled
all
this
was
very
exciting
and
a
little
bewildering
i
was
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
to
see
his
apartments
and
not
to
be
utterly
outdone
i
alluded
to
my
valet
his
apartments
were
not
so
grand
as
i
expected
but
when
he
explained
that
he
had
just
spent
ten
thousand
pounds
in
two
years
and
was
now
living
on
six
or
seven
hundred
francs
a
month
which
his
mother
would
allow
him
until
he
had
painted
and
had
sold
a
certain
series
of
pictures
which
he
contemplated
beginning
at
once
my
admiration
increased
to
wonder
and
i
examined
with
awe
the
great
fireplace
which
had
been
constructed
at
his
orders
and
admired
the
iron
pot
which
hung
by
a
chain
above
an
artificial
bivouac
fire
this
detail
will
suggest
the
rest
of
the
studio
the
turkey
carpet
the
brass
harem
lamps
the
japanese
screen
the
pieces
of
drapery
the
oak
chairs
covered
with
red
utrecht
velvet
the
oak
wardrobe
that
had
been
picked
up
somewhere
a
ridiculous
bargain
and
the
inevitable
bed
with
spiral
columns
there
were
vases
filled
with
foreign
grasses
and
palms
stood
in
the
corners
of
the
rooms
marshall
pulled
out
a
few
pictures
but
he
paid
very
little
heed
to
my
compliments
and
sitting
down
at
the
piano
with
a
great
deal
of
splashing
and
dashing
about
the
keys
he
rattled
off
a
waltz
what
waltz
is
that
i
asked
oh
nothing
something
i
composed
the
other
evening
i
had
a
fit
of
the
blues
and
did
go
out
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
think
it
beautiful
did
you
really
compose
that
the
other
evening
at
this
moment
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
an
english
girl
entered
marshall
introduced
me
with
looks
that
see
nothing
and
words
that
mean
nothing
an
amorous
woman
receives
the
man
she
finds
with
her
sweetheart
but
it
subsequently
transpired
that
alice
had
an
appointment
that
she
was
dining
out
she
would
however
call
in
the
morning
and
give
him
a
sitting
for
the
portrait
he
was
painting
of
her
i
had
hitherto
worked
very
regularly
and
attentively
at
the
studio
but
now
marshall
society
was
an
attraction
i
could
not
resist
for
the
sake
of
his
talent
which
i
religiously
believed
in
i
regretted
he
was
so
idle
but
his
dissipation
was
winning
and
his
delight
was
thorough
and
his
gay
dashing
manner
made
me
feel
happy
and
his
experience
opened
to
me
new
avenues
for
enjoyment
and
knowledge
of
life
on
my
arrival
in
paris
i
had
visited
in
the
company
of
my
taciturn
valet
the
mabille
and
the
valentino
and
i
had
dined
at
the
maison
by
myself
but
now
i
was
taken
to
strange
students
where
dinners
were
paid
for
in
pictures
to
a
mysterious
place
where
a
was
held
under
a
tent
in
a
back
garden
and
afterwards
we
went
in
great
crowds
to
the
or
the
the
clangour
of
the
band
the
unreal
greenness
of
the
foliage
the
thronging
of
the
dancers
and
the
chattering
of
women
we
only
knew
their
christian
names
and
then
the
returning
in
open
carriages
rolling
through
the
white
dust
beneath
the
immense
heavy
dome
of
the
summer
night
when
the
dusky
darkness
of
the
street
is
chequered
by
a
passing
glimpse
of
light
skirt
or
flying
feather
and
the
moon
looms
like
a
magic
lantern
out
of
the
sky
now
we
seemed
to
live
in
fiacres
and
restaurants
and
the
afternoons
were
filled
with
febrile
impressions
marshall
had
a
friend
in
this
street
and
another
in
that
it
was
only
necessary
for
him
to
cry
stop
to
the
coachman
and
to
run
up
two
or
three
flights
of
stairs
chez
elle
monsieur
si
monsieur
veut
se
donner
la
peine
and
we
were
shown
into
a
apartment
a
lady
would
enter
hurriedly
and
an
animated
discussion
was
begun
i
did
not
know
french
sufficiently
well
to
follow
the
conversation
but
i
remember
it
always
commenced
cher
and
was
plentifully
sprinkled
with
the
phrase
avez
the
ladies
themselves
had
only
just
returned
from
constantinople
or
japan
and
they
were
generally
involved
in
mysterious
lawsuits
or
were
busily
engaged
in
prosecuting
claims
for
several
millions
of
francs
against
different
foreign
governments
and
just
as
i
had
watched
the
chorus
girls
and
mummers
three
years
ago
at
the
globe
theatre
now
excited
by
a
nervous
curiosity
i
watched
this
world
of
parisian
adventurers
and
and
this
craving
for
observation
of
manners
this
instinct
for
the
rapid
notation
of
gestures
and
words
that
epitomise
a
state
of
feeling
of
attitudes
that
mirror
forth
the
soul
declared
itself
a
main
passion
and
it
grew
and
strengthened
to
the
detriment
of
the
other
art
still
so
dear
to
me
with
the
patience
of
a
cat
before
a
i
watched
and
listened
picking
one
characteristic
phrase
out
of
hours
of
vain
chatter
interested
and
amused
by
an
angry
or
loving
glance
like
the
midges
that
fret
the
surface
of
a
shadowy
stream
these
men
and
women
seemed
to
me
and
though
i
laughed
danced
and
made
merry
with
them
i
was
not
of
them
but
with
marshall
it
was
different
they
were
my
amusement
they
were
his
necessary
pleasure
and
i
knew
of
this
distinction
that
made
twain
our
lives
and
i
reflected
deeply
upon
it
why
could
i
not
live
without
an
and
acute
consciousness
of
life
why
could
i
not
love
forgetful
of
the
harsh
ticking
of
the
clock
in
the
perfumed
silence
of
the
chamber
and
so
my
friend
became
to
me
a
study
a
subject
for
dissection
the
general
attitude
of
his
mind
and
its
various
turns
all
the
apparent
contradictions
and
how
they
could
be
explained
classified
and
reduced
to
one
primary
law
were
to
me
a
constant
source
of
thought
our
confidences
knew
no
reserve
i
say
our
confidences
because
to
obtain
confidences
it
is
often
necessary
to
confide
all
we
saw
heard
read
or
felt
was
the
subject
of
mutual
confidences
the
transitory
emotion
that
a
flush
of
colour
and
a
bit
of
perspective
awakens
the
blue
tints
that
the
summer
sunset
lends
to
a
white
dress
or
the
eternal
verities
death
and
love
but
although
i
tested
every
fibre
of
thought
and
analysed
every
motive
i
was
very
sincere
in
my
friendship
and
very
loyal
in
my
admiration
nor
did
my
admiration
wane
when
i
discovered
that
marshall
was
shallow
in
his
appreciations
superficial
in
his
judgments
that
his
talents
did
not
pierce
below
the
surface
avait
si
grand
there
was
fascination
in
his
very
bearing
in
his
large
soft
colourful
eyes
and
a
go
and
dash
in
his
dissipations
that
carried
you
away
to
any
one
observing
us
at
this
time
it
would
have
seemed
that
i
was
but
a
and
a
feeble
imitator
of
marshall
i
took
him
to
my
tailor
and
he
advised
me
on
the
cut
of
my
coats
he
showed
me
how
to
arrange
my
rooms
and
i
strove
to
copy
his
manner
of
speech
and
his
general
bearing
and
yet
i
knew
very
well
indeed
that
mine
was
a
rarer
and
more
original
nature
i
was
willing
to
learn
that
was
all
there
was
much
that
marshall
could
teach
me
and
i
used
him
without
shame
without
stint
i
used
him
as
i
have
used
all
those
with
whom
i
have
been
brought
into
close
contact
search
my
memory
as
i
will
i
can
not
recall
a
case
of
man
or
woman
who
ever
occupied
any
considerable
part
of
my
thoughts
without
contributing
largely
towards
my
moral
or
physical
welfare
in
other
words
and
in
very
colloquial
language
i
never
had
useless
friends
hanging
about
me
from
this
crude
statement
of
a
signal
fact
the
thoughtless
reader
will
at
once
judge
me
rapacious
egoistical
false
fawning
mendacious
well
i
may
be
all
this
and
more
but
not
because
all
who
have
known
me
have
rendered
me
eminent
services
i
can
say
that
no
one
ever
formed
relationships
in
life
with
less
design
than
myself
never
have
i
given
a
thought
to
the
advantage
that
might
accrue
from
being
on
terms
of
friendship
with
this
man
and
avoiding
that
one
then
how
do
you
explain
cries
the
angry
reader
that
you
have
never
had
a
friend
by
whom
you
did
not
profit
you
must
have
had
very
few
friends
on
the
contrary
i
have
had
many
friends
and
of
all
sorts
and
kinds
men
and
women
and
i
repeat
none
took
part
in
my
life
who
did
not
contribute
something
towards
my
it
must
of
course
be
understood
that
i
make
no
distinction
between
mental
and
material
help
and
in
my
case
the
one
has
at
all
times
been
adjuvant
to
the
other
pooh
pooh
again
exclaims
the
reader
i
for
one
will
not
believe
that
chance
has
only
sent
across
your
way
the
people
who
were
required
to
assist
you
chance
dear
reader
is
there
such
a
thing
as
chance
do
you
believe
in
chance
do
you
attach
any
precise
meaning
to
the
word
do
you
employ
it
at
haphazard
allowing
it
to
mean
what
it
may
chance
what
a
field
for
psychical
investigation
is
at
once
opened
up
how
we
may
tear
to
shreds
our
past
lives
in
search
of
what
of
the
chance
that
made
us
i
think
reader
i
can
throw
some
light
on
the
general
question
by
replying
to
your
taunt
chance
or
the
conditions
of
life
under
which
we
live
sent
of
course
thousands
of
creatures
across
my
way
who
were
powerless
to
benefit
me
but
then
an
instinct
of
which
i
knew
nothing
of
which
i
was
not
even
conscious
withdrew
me
from
them
and
i
was
attracted
to
others
have
you
not
seen
a
horse
suddenly
leave
a
corner
of
a
field
to
seek
pasturage
further
away
never
could
i
interest
myself
in
a
book
if
it
were
not
the
exact
diet
my
mind
required
at
the
time
or
in
the
very
immediate
future
the
mind
asked
received
and
digested
so
much
was
assimilated
so
much
expelled
then
after
a
season
similar
demands
were
made
the
same
processes
were
repeated
out
of
sight
below
consciousness
as
is
the
case
in
a
stomach
shelley
who
fired
my
youth
with
passion
and
purified
and
upbore
it
for
so
long
is
now
to
me
as
nothing
not
a
dead
or
faded
thing
but
a
thing
out
of
which
i
personally
have
drawn
all
the
sustenance
i
can
draw
from
him
and
therefore
it
that
part
which
i
did
not
absorb
concerns
me
no
more
and
the
same
with
gautier
mdlle
de
maupin
that
godhead
of
flowing
line
that
desire
not
of
the
moth
for
the
star
but
for
such
perfection
of
arm
and
thigh
as
leaves
passion
breathless
and
fain
of
tears
is
now
if
i
take
up
the
book
and
read
weary
and
ragged
as
a
spider
web
that
has
hung
the
winter
through
in
the
dusty
forgotten
corner
of
a
forgotten
room
my
old
rapture
and
my
youth
delight
i
can
regain
only
when
i
think
of
that
part
of
gautier
which
is
now
incarnate
in
me
as
i
picked
up
books
so
i
picked
up
my
friends
i
read
friends
and
books
with
the
same
passion
with
the
same
avidity
and
as
i
discarded
my
books
when
i
had
assimilated
as
much
of
them
as
my
system
required
so
i
discarded
my
friends
when
they
ceased
to
be
of
use
to
me
i
employ
the
word
use
in
its
fullest
not
in
its
limited
and
sense
this
parallel
of
the
intellect
to
the
blind
unconsciousness
of
the
lower
organs
will
strike
some
as
a
violation
of
man
best
beliefs
and
as
saying
very
little
for
the
particular
intellect
that
can
be
so
reduced
but
i
am
not
sure
these
people
are
right
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
as
you
ascend
the
scale
of
thought
to
the
great
minds
these
unaccountable
impulses
mysterious
resolutions
sudden
but
certain
knowings
falling
whence
or
how
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
falling
somehow
into
the
brain
instead
of
growing
rarer
become
more
and
more
frequent
indeed
i
think
that
if
the
really
great
man
were
to
confess
to
the
working
of
his
mind
we
should
see
him
constantly
besieged
by
inspirations
inspirations
ah
how
human
thought
only
turns
in
a
circle
and
how
when
we
think
we
are
on
the
verge
of
a
new
thought
we
slip
into
the
enunciation
of
some
truth
but
i
say
again
let
general
principles
be
waived
it
will
suffice
for
the
interest
of
these
pages
if
it
be
understood
that
brain
instincts
have
always
been
and
still
are
the
initial
and
the
determining
powers
of
my
being
iii
but
the
studio
where
i
had
been
working
for
the
last
three
or
four
months
so
diligently
became
wearisome
to
me
and
for
two
reasons
first
because
it
deprived
me
of
many
hours
of
marshall
company
secondly
and
the
second
reason
was
the
graver
because
i
was
beginning
to
regard
the
delineation
of
a
nymph
or
youth
bathing
as
a
very
narrow
channel
to
carry
off
the
strong
full
tide
of
a
man
thought
for
now
thoughts
of
love
and
death
and
the
hopelessness
of
life
were
in
active
fermentation
within
me
and
sought
for
utterance
with
a
strange
persistency
of
appeal
i
yearned
merely
to
give
direct
expression
to
my
pain
life
was
then
in
its
springtide
every
thought
was
new
to
me
and
it
would
have
seemed
a
pity
to
disguise
even
the
simplest
emotion
in
any
garment
when
it
was
so
beautiful
in
its
nakedness
the
creatures
whom
i
met
in
the
ways
and
byeways
of
parisian
life
whose
gestures
and
attitudes
i
devoured
with
my
eyes
and
whose
souls
i
hungered
to
know
awoke
in
me
a
tense
irresponsible
curiosity
but
that
was
all
i
despised
i
hated
them
thought
them
contemptible
and
to
select
them
as
subjects
of
artistic
treatment
could
not
then
might
never
have
occurred
to
me
had
the
suggestion
to
do
so
not
come
direct
to
me
from
the
outside
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
i
lived
in
an
hotel
on
the
boulevard
which
an
enterprising
belgian
had
lately
bought
and
was
endeavouring
to
modernise
an
hotel
that
still
clung
to
its
ancient
character
in
the
presence
of
half
a
dozen
old
people
who
for
antediluvian
reasons
continue
to
dine
on
certain
days
at
the
fifteen
years
have
passed
away
and
these
old
people
no
doubt
have
joined
their
ancestors
but
i
can
see
them
still
sitting
in
that
à
the
en
vieux
chéne
the
opulent
candelabra
style
the
waiter
lighting
the
gas
in
the
pale
parisian
evening
that
man
that
tall
thin
american
has
dined
at
this
for
the
last
thirty
years
he
is
talkative
vain
foolish
and
authoritative
the
clean
old
gentleman
who
sits
by
him
looking
so
much
like
a
french
gentleman
has
spent
a
great
part
of
his
life
in
spain
with
that
piece
of
news
and
its
subsequent
developments
your
acquaintance
with
him
begins
and
ends
the
eyes
the
fan
the
mantilla
how
it
began
how
it
was
broken
off
and
how
it
began
again
opposite
sits
another
french
gentleman
with
beard
and
bristly
hair
he
spent
twenty
years
of
his
life
in
india
and
he
talks
of
his
son
who
has
been
out
there
for
the
last
ten
and
who
has
just
returned
home
there
is
the
italian
comtesse
of
sixty
summers
who
dresses
like
a
girl
of
sixteen
and
smokes
a
cigar
after
dinner
if
there
are
not
too
many
strangers
in
the
room
a
stranger
she
calls
any
one
whom
she
has
not
seen
at
least
once
before
the
little
fat
neckless
man
with
the
great
bald
head
fringed
below
the
ears
with
hair
is
duval
he
is
a
dramatic
author
the
author
of
a
hundred
and
sixty
plays
he
does
not
intrude
himself
on
your
notice
but
when
you
speak
to
him
on
literary
matters
he
fixes
a
pair
of
tiny
eyes
on
you
and
talks
affably
of
his
collaborateurs
i
was
soon
deeply
interested
in
duval
and
i
invited
him
to
come
to
the
after
dinner
i
paid
for
his
coffee
and
liqueurs
i
offered
him
a
choice
cigar
he
did
not
smoke
i
did
it
was
of
course
inevitable
that
i
should
find
out
that
he
had
not
had
a
play
produced
for
the
last
twenty
years
but
then
the
aureole
of
the
hundred
and
sixty
was
about
his
poor
bald
head
i
thought
of
the
chances
of
life
he
alluded
to
the
war
and
so
this
unpleasantness
was
passed
over
and
we
entered
on
more
genial
subjects
of
conversation
he
had
written
plays
with
everybody
his
list
of
collaborateurs
was
longer
than
any
list
of
lady
patronesses
for
an
english
county
ball
there
was
no
literary
kitchen
in
which
he
had
not
helped
to
dish
up
i
was
at
once
amazed
and
delighted
had
duval
written
his
hundred
and
sixty
plays
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
rooms
i
should
have
been
less
surprised
it
was
the
mystery
of
the
of
collaboration
the
rendezvous
the
discussion
the
illustrious
company
that
overwhelmed
me
in
a
rapture
of
wonder
and
respectful
admiration
then
came
the
anecdotes
they
were
of
all
sorts
here
are
a
few
specimens
he
duval
had
written
a
piece
with
dumas
it
had
been
refused
at
the
français
and
then
it
had
been
about
here
there
and
everywhere
finally
the
had
asked
for
some
alterations
and
une
affaire
i
made
the
alterations
one
afternoon
and
wrote
to
dumas
and
what
do
you
think
by
return
of
post
i
had
a
letter
from
him
saying
he
could
not
consent
to
the
production
of
a
piece
signed
by
him
at
the
because
his
son
was
then
giving
a
piece
at
the
gymnase
then
came
a
string
of
indecent
witticisms
by
suzanne
lagier
and
dejazet
they
were
as
old
as
the
world
but
they
were
new
to
me
and
i
was
amused
and
astonished
these
were
followed
by
an
account
of
how
gautier
wrote
his
sunday
feuilleton
and
how
he
and
balzac
had
once
nearly
come
to
blows
they
had
agreed
to
collaborate
balzac
was
to
contribute
the
scenario
gautier
the
dialogue
one
morning
balzac
came
with
the
scenario
of
the
first
act
here
it
is
gautier
i
suppose
you
can
let
me
have
it
back
finished
by
afternoon
and
the
old
gentleman
would
chirp
along
in
this
fashion
till
midnight
i
would
then
accompany
him
to
his
rooms
in
the
quartier
montmartre
rooms
high
up
on
the
fifth
floor
where
between
two
pictures
supposed
to
be
by
angelica
kauffmann
duval
had
written
unactable
plays
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
where
he
would
continue
to
write
unactable
plays
until
god
called
him
to
a
world
perhaps
of
eternal
cantatas
but
where
by
all
accounts
de
la
pièce
selon
la
formule
de
is
still
unknown
how
i
used
to
enjoy
these
conversations
i
remember
how
i
used
to
stand
on
the
pavement
after
having
bid
the
old
gentleman
regretting
i
had
not
asked
for
some
further
explanation
regarding
mouvement
or
façon
de
scribe
de
ménager
la
why
not
write
a
comedy
so
the
thought
came
i
had
never
written
anything
save
a
few
letters
but
no
matter
to
find
a
plot
was
the
first
thing
take
marshall
for
hero
and
alice
for
heroine
surround
them
with
the
old
gentlemen
who
dined
at
the
flavour
with
the
italian
countess
who
smoked
cigars
when
there
were
not
too
many
strangers
present
after
three
weeks
of
industrious
stirring
the
ingredients
did
begin
to
simmer
into
something
resembling
a
plot
put
it
upon
paper
ah
there
was
my
difficulty
i
remembered
suddenly
that
i
had
read
cain
manfred
the
cenci
as
poems
without
ever
thinking
of
how
the
dialogue
looked
upon
paper
besides
they
were
in
blank
verse
i
had
a
notion
how
prose
dialogue
would
look
upon
paper
shakespeare
i
had
never
opened
no
instinctive
want
had
urged
me
to
read
him
he
had
remained
therefore
unread
unlooked
at
should
i
buy
a
copy
no
the
name
repelled
me
as
all
popular
names
repelled
me
in
preference
i
went
to
the
gymnase
and
listened
attentively
to
a
comedy
by
dumas
but
strain
my
imagination
as
i
would
i
could
not
see
the
spoken
words
in
their
written
form
oh
for
a
look
at
the
prompter
copy
the
corner
of
which
i
could
see
when
i
leaned
forward
at
last
i
discovered
in
galignani
library
a
copy
of
leigh
edition
of
the
old
dramatists
and
after
a
month
study
of
congreve
wycherley
vanbrugh
and
farquhar
i
completed
a
comedy
in
three
acts
which
i
entitled
worldliness
it
was
of
course
very
bad
but
if
my
memory
serves
me
well
i
do
not
think
it
was
nearly
so
bad
as
might
be
imagined
no
sooner
was
the
last
scene
written
than
i
started
at
once
for
london
confident
i
should
find
no
difficulty
in
getting
my
play
produced
iv
is
it
necessary
to
say
that
i
did
not
find
a
manager
to
produce
my
play
a
printer
was
more
obtainable
and
the
correction
of
proofs
amused
me
for
a
while
i
wrote
another
play
and
when
the
hieing
after
theatrical
managers
began
to
lose
its
attractiveness
my
thoughts
reverted
to
france
which
always
haunted
me
and
which
now
possessed
me
as
if
with
the
sweet
and
magnetic
influence
of
home
how
important
my
absence
from
paris
seemed
to
me
and
how
paris
rushed
into
my
eyes
paris
public
the
models
in
the
studio
and
the
young
girls
painting
and
marshall
alice
and
julien
marshall
my
thoughts
pointed
at
him
through
the
intervening
streets
and
the
endless
procession
of
people
coming
and
going
marshall
is
he
at
home
marshall
left
here
some
months
ago
do
you
know
his
address
i
ask
my
husband
do
you
know
marshall
address
yes
he
gone
to
live
in
the
rue
de
douai
what
number
i
think
it
is
fifty
four
thanks
coachman
wake
up
drive
me
to
the
rue
de
douai
but
marshall
was
not
to
be
found
at
the
rue
de
douai
and
he
had
left
no
address
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
to
the
studio
i
should
be
able
to
obtain
news
of
him
there
perhaps
find
him
but
when
i
pulled
aside
the
curtain
the
accustomed
piece
of
slim
nakedness
did
not
greet
my
eyes
only
the
blue
apron
of
an
old
woman
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
dust
the
gentlemen
are
not
here
the
studio
is
closed
i
am
sweeping
up
oh
and
where
is
m
julien
i
can
not
say
sir
perhaps
at
the
or
perhaps
he
is
gone
to
the
country
this
was
not
very
encouraging
and
now
my
enthusiasm
thoroughly
damped
i
strolled
along
looking
at
the
fans
the
bangles
and
the
litter
of
cheap
trinkets
that
each
window
was
filled
with
on
the
left
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
was
our
as
i
came
forward
the
waiter
moved
one
of
the
tin
tables
and
then
i
saw
the
fat
provençal
but
just
as
if
he
had
seen
me
yesterday
he
said
vous
une
oui
garçon
une
presently
the
conversation
turned
on
marshall
they
had
not
seen
much
of
him
lately
parait
est
plus
amoureux
que
julien
replied
sardonically
v
i
found
my
friend
in
large
furnished
apartments
on
the
ground
floor
in
the
rue
duphot
the
walls
were
stretched
with
blue
silk
there
were
large
mirrors
and
great
gilt
cornices
passing
into
the
bedroom
i
found
the
young
god
wallowing
in
the
finest
of
fine
linen
in
a
great
louis
xv
bed
and
there
were
cupids
above
him
holloa
what
you
back
again
george
moore
we
thought
we
were
going
to
see
you
again
it
nearly
one
get
up
what
the
news
is
the
opening
of
the
exhibition
of
the
impressionists
have
a
bit
of
breakfast
round
the
corner
at
durant
and
we
go
on
there
i
hear
that
bedlam
is
nothing
to
it
there
is
a
canvas
there
twenty
feet
square
and
in
three
tints
pale
yellow
for
the
sunlight
brown
for
the
shadows
and
all
the
rest
is
there
is
i
am
told
a
lady
walking
in
the
foreground
with
a
monkey
and
the
tail
is
said
to
be
three
yards
long
we
went
to
jeer
a
group
of
enthusiasts
that
willingly
forfeit
all
delights
of
the
world
in
the
hope
of
realising
a
new
æstheticism
we
went
insolent
with
patent
leather
shoes
and
bright
kid
gloves
and
armed
with
all
the
jargon
of
the
school
jambe
ne
porte
pas
la
nature
ne
se
fait
pas
comme
ça
on
dessine
par

masses
combien
de

mettrais
dans

bocal
un
in
a
word
all
that
the
journals
of
culture
are
pleased
to
term
an
artistic
education
we
indulged
in
boisterous
laughter
exaggerated
in
the
hope
of
giving
as
much
pain
as
possible
and
deep
down
in
our
souls
we
knew
that
we
were
lying
at
least
i
did
in
the
beginning
of
this
century
the
tradition
of
french
art
the
tradition
of
boucher
fragonard
and
watteau
had
been
completely
lost
having
produced
genius
their
art
died
ingres
is
the
sublime
flower
of
the
classic
art
which
succeeded
the
art
of
the
palace
and
the
boudoir
further
than
ingres
it
was
impossible
to
go
and
his
art
died
then
the
turners
and
constables
came
to
france
and
they
begot
troyon
and
troyon
begot
millet
courbet
corot
and
rousseau
and
these
in
turn
begot
degas
pissarro
madame
morizot
and
guillaumin
degas
is
a
pupil
of
ingres
but
he
applies
the
marvellous
acuteness
of
drawing
he
learned
from
his
master
to
delineating
the
humblest
aspects
of
modern
life
degas
draws
not
by
the
masses
but
by
the
character
his
subjects
are
and
washerwomen
but
the
qualities
that
endow
them
with
immortality
are
precisely
those
which
eternalise
the
virgins
and
saints
of
leonardo
da
vinci
in
the
minds
of
men
you
see
the
fat
vulgar
woman
in
the
long
cloak
trying
on
a
hat
in
front
of
the
so
marvellously
well
are
the
lines
of
her
face
observed
and
rendered
that
you
can
tell
exactly
what
her
position
in
life
is
you
know
what
the
furniture
of
her
rooms
is
like
you
know
what
she
would
say
to
you
if
she
were
to
speak
she
is
as
typical
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
fragonard
ladies
are
of
the
court
of
louis
xv
to
the
right
you
see
a
picture
of
two
with
bonnets
in
their
hands
so
accurately
are
the
habitual
movements
of
the
heads
and
the
hands
observed
that
you
at
once
realise
the
years
of
and
servile
words
that
these
women
have
lived
through
we
have
seen
degas
do
this
before
it
is
a
welcome
repetition
of
a
familiar
note
but
it
is
not
until
we
turn
to
the
set
of
nude
figures
that
we
find
the
great
artist
revealing
any
new
phase
of
his
talent
the
first
in
an
attitude
which
suggests
the
kneeling
venus
washes
her
thighs
in
a
tin
bath
the
second
a
back
view
full
of
the
malformations
of
forty
years
of
children
of
hard
work
stands
gripping
her
flanks
with
both
hands
the
naked
woman
has
become
impossible
in
modern
art
it
required
genius
to
infuse
new
life
into
the
theme
cynicism
was
the
great
means
of
eloquence
of
the
middle
ages
and
with
cynicism
degas
has
rendered
the
nude
again
an
artistic
possibility
what
horsley
or
the
british
matron
would
say
it
is
difficult
to
guess
perhaps
the
hideousness
depicted
by
degas
would
frighten
them
more
than
the
sensuality
which
they
condemn
in
sir
frederick
leighton
but
be
this
as
it
may
it
is
certain
that
the
great
fat
creature
who
in
her
humble
and
touching
ugliness
passes
a
chemise
over
her
lumpy
shoulders
is
a
triumph
of
art
ugliness
is
trivial
the
monstrous
is
terrible
velasquez
knew
this
when
he
painted
his
dwarfs
pissarro
exhibited
a
group
of
girls
gathering
apples
in
a
garden
sad
greys
and
violets
beautifully
harmonised
the
figures
seem
to
move
as
in
a
dream
we
are
on
the
thither
side
of
life
in
a
world
of
quiet
colour
and
happy
aspiration
those
apples
will
never
fall
from
the
branches
those
baskets
that
the
stooping
girls
are
filling
will
never
be
filled
that
garden
is
the
garden
of
the
peace
that
life
has
not
for
giving
but
which
the
painter
has
set
in
an
eternal
dream
of
violet
and
grey
madame
morizot
exhibited
a
series
of
delicate
fancies
here
are
two
young
girls
the
sweet
atmosphere
folds
them
as
with
a
veil
they
are
all
summer
their
dreams
are
limitless
their
days
are
fading
and
their
ideas
follow
the
flight
of
the
white
butterflies
through
the
standard
roses
take
note
too
of
the
stand
of
fans
what
delicious
fancies
are
there
willows
balconies
gardens
and
terraces
then
contrasting
with
these
distant
tendernesses
there
was
the
vigorous
painting
of
guillaumin
there
life
is
rendered
in
violent
and
colourful
brutality
the
ladies
fishing
in
the
park
with
the
violet
of
the
skies
and
the
green
of
the
trees
descending
upon
them
is
a
nature
seems
to
be
closing
about
them
like
a
tomb
and
that
hillside
sunset
flooding
the
skies
with
yellow
and
the
earth
with
blue
shadow
is
another
piece
of
painting
that
will
one
day
find
a
place
in
one
of
the
public
galleries
and
the
same
can
be
said
of
the
portrait
of
the
woman
on
a
background
of
chintz
flowers
we
could
but
utter
coarse
gibes
and
exclaim
what
could
have
induced
him
to
paint
such
things
surely
he
must
have
seen
that
it
was
absurd
i
wonder
if
the
impressionists
are
in
earnest
or
if
it
is
only
blague
nous
then
we
stood
and
screamed
at
monet
that
most
exquisite
painter
of
blonde
light
we
stood
before
the
turkeys
and
seriously
we
wondered
if
it
was
serious
work
that
the
high
grass
that
the
turkeys
are
gobbling
is
flooded
with
sunlight
so
swift
and
intense
that
for
a
moment
the
illusion
is
complete
just
look
at
the
house
why
the
turkeys
could
walk
in
at
the
door
the
perspective
is
all
wrong
then
followed
other
remarks
of
an
educational
kind
and
when
we
came
to
those
piercingly
personal
visions
of
railway
stations
by
the
same
painter
those
rapid
sensations
of
steel
and
vapour
our
laughter
knew
no
bounds
i
say
marshall
just
look
at
this
wheel
he
dipped
his
brush
into
cadmium
yellow
and
whisked
it
round
that
all
nor
had
we
any
more
understanding
for
renoir
rich
sensualities
of
tone
nor
did
the
mastery
with
which
he
achieves
an
absence
of
shadow
appeal
to
us
you
see
colour
and
light
in
his
pictures
as
you
do
in
nature
and
the
child
criticism
of
a
portrait
why
is
one
side
of
the
face
black
is
answered
there
was
a
nude
figure
of
a
girl
how
the
round
fresh
breasts
palpitate
in
the
light
such
a
glorious
glow
of
whiteness
was
attained
never
before
but
we
saw
nothing
except
that
the
eyes
were
out
of
drawing
for
art
was
not
for
us
then
as
it
is
now
a
mere
emotion
right
or
wrong
only
in
proportion
to
its
intensity
we
believed
then
in
the
grammar
of
art
perspective
anatomy
and
jambe
qui
and
we
found
all
this
in
julien
studio
a
year
passed
a
year
of
art
and
dissipation
one
part
art
two
parts
dissipation
we
mounted
and
descended
at
pleasure
the
rounds
of
society
ladder
one
evening
we
would
spend
at
constant
rue
de
la
gaieté
in
the
company
of
thieves
and
housebreakers
on
the
following
evening
we
were
dining
with
a
duchess
or
a
princess
in
the
champs
elysées
and
we
prided
ourselves
vastly
on
our
versatility
in
using
with
equal
facility
the
language
of
the
fence
parlour
and
that
of
the
literary
on
being
able
to
appear
as
much
at
home
in
one
as
in
the
other
delighted
at
our
prowess
we
often
whispered
the
princess
i
swear
would
not
believe
her
eyes
if
she
saw
us
now
and
then
in
terrible
slang
we
shouted
a
benediction
on
some
crib
that
was
going
to
be
broken
into
that
evening
and
we
thought
there
was
something
very
thrilling
in
leaving
the
rue
de
la
gaieté
returning
home
to
dress
and
presenting
our
spotless
selves
to
the
and
we
succeeded
very
well
as
indeed
all
young
men
do
who
waltz
perfectly
and
avoid
making
love
to
the
wrong
woman
but
the
excitement
of
climbing
up
and
down
the
social
ladder
did
not
stave
off
our
craving
for
art
and
about
this
time
there
came
a
very
decisive
event
in
our
lives
marshall
last
and
really
had
come
to
a
violent
termination
and
monetary
difficulties
forced
him
to
turn
his
thoughts
to
painting
on
china
as
a
means
of
livelihood
and
as
this
young
man
always
sought
extremes
he
went
to
belleville
donned
a
blouse
ate
garlic
with
his
food
and
settled
down
to
live
there
as
a
workman
i
had
been
to
see
him
and
had
found
him
building
a
wall
and
with
sorrow
i
related
his
state
that
evening
to
julien
in
the
café
veron
he
said
after
a
pause
since
you
profess
so
much
friendship
for
him
why
do
you
not
do
him
a
service
that
can
not
be
forgotten
since
the
result
will
always
continue
why
do
you
save
him
from
the
life
you
describe
if
you
are
not
actually
rich
you
are
at
least
in
easy
circumstances
and
can
afford
to
give
him
a
of
three
hundred
francs
a
month
i
will
give
him
the
use
of
my
studio
which
means
as
you
know
models
and
teaching
marshall
has
plenty
of
talent
all
he
wants
is
a
year
education
in
a
year
or
a
certainly
at
the
end
of
two
years
he
will
begin
to
make
money
it
is
rather
a
shock
to
one
who
is
at
all
concerned
with
his
own
genius
to
be
asked
to
act
as
to
another
then
three
hundred
francs
meant
a
great
deal
plainly
it
meant
deprivation
of
those
superfluities
which
are
so
intensely
necessary
to
the
delicate
and
refined
julien
watched
me
this
large
crafty
southerner
knew
what
was
passing
in
me
he
knew
i
was
realising
all
the
manifold
inconveniences
the
duty
of
looking
after
marshall
wants
for
two
years
and
to
make
the
pill
easier
he
said
if
three
hundred
francs
a
month
are
too
heavy
for
your
purse
you
might
take
an
apartment
and
ask
marshall
to
come
and
live
with
you
you
told
me
the
other
day
you
were
tired
of
hotel
life
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
you
to
live
with
him
you
want
to
do
something
yourself
and
the
fact
of
his
being
obliged
to
attend
the
studio
for
i
should
advise
you
to
have
a
strict
agreement
with
him
regarding
the
work
he
is
to
do
would
be
an
extra
inducement
to
you
to
work
hard
i
always
decide
at
once
reflection
does
not
help
me
and
a
moment
after
i
said
very
well
julien
i
will
and
next
day
i
went
with
the
news
to
belleville
marshall
protested
he
had
no
real
talent
i
protested
he
had
the
agreement
was
drawn
up
and
signed
he
was
to
work
in
the
studio
eight
hours
a
day
he
was
to
draw
until
such
time
as
lefebvre
set
him
to
paint
and
in
proof
of
his
industry
he
was
to
bring
me
at
the
end
of
each
week
a
study
from
life
and
a
composition
the
subject
of
which
the
master
gave
at
the
beginning
of
each
week
and
in
return
i
was
to
take
an
apartment
near
the
studio
give
him
an
abode
food
etc
once
the
matter
was
decided
marshall
manifested
prodigious
energy
and
three
days
after
he
told
me
he
had
found
an
apartment
in
le
passage
des
panoramas
which
would
suit
us
perfectly
the
plunge
had
to
be
taken
i
paid
my
hotel
bill
and
sent
my
taciturn
valet
to
beef
beer
and
a
wife
it
was
unpleasant
to
have
a
window
opening
not
to
the
sky
but
to
an
unclean
prospect
of
glass
roofing
nor
was
it
agreeable
to
get
up
at
seven
in
the
morning
and
ten
hours
of
work
daily
are
trying
to
the
resolution
even
of
the
best
intentioned
but
we
had
sworn
to
forego
all
pleasures
for
the
sake
of
art
in
the
rue
maubeuge
french
and
foreign
duchesses
in
the
champs
elysées
thieves
in
the
rue
de
la
gaieté
i
was
entering
therefore
on
a
duel
with
marshall
for
supremacy
in
an
art
for
which
as
has
already
been
said
i
possessed
no
qualifications
it
will
readily
be
understood
how
a
mind
like
mine
so
intensely
alive
to
all
impulses
and
so
unsupported
by
any
moral
convictions
would
suffer
in
so
keen
a
contest
waged
under
such
unequal
and
cruel
conditions
it
was
in
truth
a
year
of
great
passion
and
great
despair
defeat
is
bitter
when
it
comes
swiftly
and
conclusively
but
when
defeat
falls
by
inches
like
the
pendulum
in
the
pit
the
agony
is
a
little
beyond
verbal
expression
i
remember
the
first
day
of
my
martyrdom
the
clocks
were
striking
eight
we
chose
our
places
got
into
position
after
the
first
hour
i
compared
my
drawing
with
marshall
he
had
it
is
true
caught
the
movement
of
the
figure
better
than
i
but
the
character
and
the
quality
of
his
work
was
miserable
that
of
mine
was
not
i
have
said
i
possessed
no
artistic
facility
but
i
did
not
say
faculty
my
drawing
was
never
common
it
was
individual
in
feeling
it
was
refined
i
possessed
all
the
rarer
qualities
but
not
that
primary
power
without
which
all
is
valueless
i
mean
the
talent
of
the
boy
who
can
knock
off
a
clever
caricature
of
his
or
make
a
sketch
of
his
favourite
horse
on
the
barn
door
with
a
piece
of
chalk
the
following
week
marshall
made
a
great
deal
of
progress
i
thought
the
model
did
not
suit
me
and
hoped
for
better
luck
next
time
that
time
never
came
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
month
i
was
left
toiling
hopelessly
in
the
distance
marshall
mind
though
shallow
was
bright
and
he
understood
with
strange
ease
all
that
was
told
him
and
was
able
to
put
into
immediate
practice
the
methods
of
work
inculcated
by
the
professors
in
fact
he
showed
himself
singularly
capable
of
education
little
could
be
drawn
out
but
a
great
deal
could
be
put
in
using
the
word
in
its
modern
not
in
its
original
sense
he
showed
himself
intensely
anxious
to
learn
and
to
accept
all
that
was
said
the
ideas
and
feelings
of
others
ran
into
him
like
water
into
a
bottle
whose
neck
is
suddenly
stooped
below
the
surface
of
the
stream
he
was
an
ideal
pupil
it
was
marshall
here
it
was
marshall
there
and
soon
the
studio
was
little
but
an
agitation
in
praise
of
him
and
his
work
and
anxious
speculation
arose
as
to
the
medals
he
would
obtain
i
continued
the
struggle
for
nine
months
i
was
in
the
studio
at
eight
in
the
morning
i
measured
my
drawing
i
plumbed
it
throughout
i
sketched
in
having
regard
to
jambe
qui
i
modelled
les
during
breakfast
i
considered
how
i
should
work
during
the
afternoon
at
night
i
lay
awake
thinking
of
what
i
might
do
to
obtain
a
better
result
but
my
efforts
availed
me
nothing
it
was
like
one
who
falling
stretches
his
arms
for
help
and
grasps
the
yielding
air
how
terrible
are
the
languors
and
yearnings
of
impotence
how
wearing
what
an
aching
void
they
leave
in
the
heart
and
all
this
i
suffered
until
the
burden
of
unachieved
desire
grew
intolerable
i
laid
down
my
charcoal
and
said
i
will
never
draw
or
paint
again
that
vow
i
have
kept
surrender
brought
relief
but
my
life
seemed
at
an
end
i
looked
upon
a
blank
space
of
years
desolate
as
a
grey
and
sailless
sea
what
shall
i
do
i
asked
myself
and
my
heart
was
weary
and
hopeless
literature
my
heart
did
not
answer
the
question
at
once
i
was
too
broken
and
overcome
by
the
shock
of
failure
failure
precise
and
stern
admitting
of
no
equivocation
i
strove
to
read
but
it
was
impossible
to
sit
at
home
almost
within
earshot
of
the
studio
and
with
all
the
memories
of
defeat
still
ringing
their
knells
in
my
heart
marshall
success
clamoured
loudly
from
without
every
day
almost
every
hour
of
the
day
i
heard
of
the
medals
which
he
would
carry
off
of
what
lefebvre
thought
of
his
drawing
this
week
of
boulanger
opinion
of
his
talent
i
do
not
wish
to
excuse
my
conduct
but
i
can
not
help
saying
that
marshall
showed
me
neither
consideration
nor
pity
he
did
not
even
seem
to
understand
that
i
was
suffering
that
my
nerves
had
been
terribly
shaken
and
he
flaunted
his
superiority
relentlessly
in
my
face
his
good
looks
his
talents
his
popularity
i
did
not
know
then
how
little
these
studio
successes
really
meant
vanity
no
it
was
not
his
vanity
that
maddened
me
to
me
vanity
is
rarely
displeasing
sometimes
it
is
singularly
attractive
but
by
a
certain
insistence
and
aggressiveness
in
the
details
of
life
he
allowed
me
to
feel
that
i
was
only
a
means
for
the
moment
a
serviceable
thing
enough
but
one
that
would
be
very
soon
discarded
and
passed
over
this
was
intolerable
i
packed
up
my
portmanteau
and
left
after
having
kept
my
promise
for
only
ten
months
by
so
doing
i
involved
my
friend
in
grave
and
cruel
difficulties
by
this
action
i
imperilled
his
future
prospects
it
was
a
dastardly
action
but
his
presence
had
grown
unbearable
yes
unbearable
in
the
fullest
acceptation
of
the
word
and
in
ridding
myself
of
him
i
felt
as
if
a
world
of
misery
were
being
lifted
from
me
vi
after
three
months
spent
in
a
sweet
seaside
resort
where
unoccupied
men
and
ladies
whose
husbands
are
abroad
happily
congregate
i
returned
to
paris
refreshed
marshall
and
i
were
no
longer
on
speaking
terms
but
i
saw
him
daily
in
a
new
overcoat
of
a
cut
admirably
adapted
to
his
figure
sweeping
past
the
fans
and
the
jet
ornaments
of
the
passage
des
panoramas
the
coat
interested
me
and
i
remembered
that
if
i
had
not
broken
with
him
i
should
have
been
able
to
ask
him
some
essential
questions
concerning
it
of
such
trifles
as
this
the
sincerest
friendships
are
made
he
was
as
necessary
to
me
as
i
to
him
and
after
some
demur
on
his
part
a
reconciliation
was
effected
then
i
took
an
in
one
of
the
old
houses
in
rue
de
la
tour
des
dames
for
windows
there
overlooked
a
bit
of
tangled
garden
with
a
dilapidated
statue
it
was
marshall
of
course
who
undertook
the
task
of
furnishing
and
he
lavished
on
the
rooms
the
fancies
of
an
imagination
that
suggested
the
collaboration
of
a
courtesan
of
high
degree
and
a
artist
nevertheless
our
was
a
pretty
resort
english
cretonne
of
a
very
happy
design
vine
leaves
dark
green
and
golden
broken
up
by
many
fluttering
jays
the
walls
were
stretched
with
this
colourful
cloth
and
the
and
the
couches
were
to
match
the
was
in
cardinal
red
hung
from
the
middle
of
the
ceiling
and
looped
up
to
give
the
appearance
of
a
tent
a
faun
in
laughed
in
the
red
gloom
and
there
were
turkish
couches
and
lamps
in
another
room
you
faced
an
altar
a
buddhist
temple
a
statue
of
the
apollo
and
a
bust
of
shelley
the
bedrooms
were
made
unconventual
with
cushioned
seats
and
rich
canopies
and
in
picturesque
corners
there
were
censers
great
church
candlesticks
and
palms
then
think
of
the
smell
of
burning
incense
and
wax
and
you
will
have
imagined
the
sentiment
of
our
apartment
in
rue
de
la
tour
des
dames
i
bought
a
persian
cat
and
a
python
that
made
a
monthly
meal
off
guinea
pigs
marshall
who
did
not
care
for
pets
filled
his
rooms
with
flowers
he
used
to
sleep
beneath
a
tree
of
gardenias
in
full
bloom
we
were
so
henry
marshall
and
george
moore
when
we
went
to
live
in
rue
de
la
tour
des
dames
we
hoped
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
he
was
to
paint
i
was
to
write
before
leaving
for
the
seaside
i
had
bought
some
volumes
of
hugo
and
de
musset
but
in
pleasant
sunny
boulogne
poetry
went
flat
and
it
was
not
until
i
got
into
my
new
rooms
that
i
began
to
read
seriously
books
are
like
individuals
you
know
at
once
if
they
are
going
to
create
a
sense
within
the
sense
to
fever
to
madden
you
in
blood
and
brain
or
if
they
will
merely
leave
you
indifferent
or
irritable
having
unpleasantly
disturbed
sweet
intimate
musings
as
might
a
draught
from
an
open
window
many
are
the
reasons
for
love
but
i
confess
i
only
love
woman
or
book
when
it
is
as
a
voice
of
conscience
never
heard
before
heard
suddenly
a
voice
i
am
at
once
endearingly
intimate
with
this
announces
feminine
depravities
in
my
affections
i
am
feminine
morbid
perverse
but
above
all
perverse
almost
everything
perverse
interests
fascinates
me
wordsworth
is
the
only
man
i
ever
loved
if
that
great
austere
mind
chill
even
as
the
cumberland
year
can
be
called
simple
but
hugo
is
not
perverse
nor
even
personal
reading
him
was
like
being
in
church
with
a
preacher
shouting
from
out
of
a
terribly
sonorous
pulpit
les
orientales
an
east
of
painted
cardboard
tin
daggers
and
a
military
band
playing
the
turkish
patrol
in
the
palais
royal
the
verse
is
grand
noble
tremendous
i
liked
it
i
admired
it
but
it
did
not
i
repeat
the
phrase
awake
a
voice
of
conscience
within
me
and
even
the
structure
of
the
verse
was
too
much
in
the
style
of
public
buildings
to
please
me
of
les
feuilles
and
les
chants
du
crépuscule
i
remember
nothing
ten
lines
fifty
lines
of
les
légendes
des
siècles
and
i
always
think
that
it
is
the
greatest
poetry
i
have
ever
read
but
after
a
few
pages
the
book
is
laid
down
and
forgotten
having
composed
more
verses
than
any
man
that
ever
lived
hugo
can
only
be
taken
in
the
smallest
doses
if
you
repeat
any
passage
to
a
friend
across
a
table
you
are
both
appalled
by
the
splendour
of
the
imagery
by
the
thunder
of
the
syllables
quel
dieu
quel
moissonneur
de
été
avait
en
allant
négligemment
jeté
cette
faucille
dans
les
champs
des
étoiles
but
if
i
read
an
entire
poem
i
never
escape
that
sensation
of
the
which
is
inherent
in
the
gaud
and
the
glitter
of
the
italian
or
spanish
improvisatore
there
never
was
anything
french
about
genius
hugo
was
a
cross
between
an
italian
improvisatore
and
a
metaphysical
german
student
take
another
verse
le
clair
de
lune
bleu
qui
baigne
without
a
like
or
an
as
by
a
mere
statement
of
fact
the
picture
nay
more
the
impression
is
produced
i
confess
i
have
a
weakness
for
the
poem
which
this
line
concludes
la
fête
chez
thérèse
but
admirable
as
it
is
with
its
picture
of
mediæval
life
there
is
in
it
as
in
all
hugo
work
a
sense
of
fabrication
that
dries
up
emotion
in
my
heart
he
shouts
and
raves
over
poor
humanity
while
he
is
gathering
coppers
for
himself
he
goes
in
for
an
patronage
of
the
almighty
in
a
last
stanza
but
of
the
two
immortalities
he
evidently
considers
his
own
the
most
durable
he
does
not
however
become
really
intolerable
until
he
gets
on
the
subject
of
little
children
he
sings
their
innocence
in
great
bombast
but
he
is
watching
them
the
poetry
over
the
crowd
dispersed
he
will
entice
one
of
them
down
a
byway
the
first
time
i
read
of
bouche
i
was
astonished
nor
did
the
second
or
third
repetition
produce
a
change
in
my
mood
of
mind
but
sooner
or
later
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
conviction
that
of
the
two
the
rosy
fingers
of
the
dawn
although
some
three
thousand
years
older
is
younger
truer
and
more
beautiful
homer
similes
can
never
grow
old
bouche
was
old
the
first
time
it
was
said
it
is
the
birthplace
and
the
grave
of
hugo
genius
of
alfred
de
musset
i
had
heard
a
great
deal
marshall
and
the
marquise
were
in
the
habit
of
reading
him
in
moments
of
relaxation
they
had
marked
their
favourite
passages
so
he
came
to
me
highly
recommended
nevertheless
i
made
but
little
progress
in
his
poetry
his
modernisms
were
out
of
tune
with
the
strain
of
my
aspirations
at
that
moment
and
i
did
not
find
the
unexpected
word
and
the
eccentricities
of
expression
which
were
and
are
still
so
dear
to
me
i
am
not
a
purist
an
error
of
diction
is
very
pardonable
if
it
does
not
err
on
the
side
of
the
commonplace
the
commonplace
the
natural
is
constitutionally
abhorrent
to
me
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
read
with
any
very
thorough
sense
of
pleasure
even
the
opening
lines
of
rolla
that
splendid
lyrical
outburst
what
i
remember
of
it
now
are
those
two
odious
marchait
et
and
fille
de
nor
does
the
fact
that
rhymes
with
condone
the
offence
although
it
proves
that
even
musset
felt
that
perhaps
the
richness
of
the
rhyme
might
render
tolerable
the
intolerable
and
it
is
to
my
credit
that
the
spanish
love
songs
moved
me
not
at
all
and
it
was
not
until
i
read
that
magnificently
grotesque
poem
la
ballade
à
la
lune
that
i
could
be
induced
to
bend
the
knee
and
acknowledge
musset
a
poet
i
still
read
and
spoke
of
shelley
with
a
rapture
of
joy
he
was
still
my
soul
but
this
craft
fashioned
of
with
starlight
at
the
helm
and
moonbeams
for
sails
suddenly
ran
on
a
reef
and
went
down
not
out
of
sight
but
out
of
the
agitation
of
actual
life
the
reef
was
gautier
i
read
mdlle
de
maupin
the
reaction
was
as
violent
as
it
was
sudden
i
was
weary
of
spiritual
passion
and
this
great
exaltation
of
the
body
above
the
soul
at
once
conquered
and
led
me
captive
this
plain
scorn
of
a
world
as
exemplified
in
lacerated
saints
and
a
crucified
redeemer
opened
up
to
me
illimitable
prospects
of
fresh
beliefs
and
therefore
new
joys
in
things
and
new
revolts
against
all
that
had
come
to
form
part
and
parcel
of
the
commonalty
of
mankind
till
now
i
had
not
even
remotely
suspected
that
a
deification
of
flesh
and
fleshly
desire
was
possible
shelley
teaching
had
been
while
accepting
the
body
to
dream
of
the
soul
as
a
star
and
so
preserve
our
ideal
but
now
suddenly
i
saw
with
delightful
clearness
and
with
intoxicating
conviction
that
by
looking
without
shame
and
accepting
with
love
the
flesh
i
might
raise
it
to
as
high
a
place
within
as
divine
a
light
as
even
the
soul
had
been
set
in
the
ages
were
as
an
aureole
and
i
stood
as
if
enchanted
before
the
noble
nakedness
of
the
elder
gods
not
the
infamous
nudity
that
sex
has
preserved
in
this
modern
world
but
the
clean
pagan
nude
a
love
of
life
and
beauty
the
broad
fair
breast
of
a
boy
the
long
flanks
the
head
thrown
back
the
bold
fearless
gaze
of
venus
is
lovelier
than
the
lowered
glance
of
the
virgin
and
i
cried
with
my
master
that
the
blood
that
flowed
upon
mount
calvary
jamais
baigné
dans
ses
i
will
not
turn
to
the
book
to
find
the
exact
words
of
this
sublime
vindication
for
ten
years
i
have
not
read
the
word
that
has
become
so
inexpressibly
a
part
of
me
and
shall
i
not
refrain
as
mdlle
de
maupin
refrained
knowing
well
that
the
face
of
love
may
not
be
twice
seen
great
was
my
conversion
none
more
than
i
had
cherished
mystery
and
dream
my
life
until
now
had
been
but
a
mist
which
revealed
as
each
cloud
wreathed
and
went
out
the
red
of
some
strange
flower
or
some
tall
peak
blue
and
snowy
and
fairylike
in
lonely
moonlight
and
now
so
great
was
my
conversion
that
the
more
brutal
the
outrage
offered
to
my
ancient
ideal
the
rarer
and
keener
was
my
delight
i
read
almost
without
fear
my
dreams
were
of
naked
youths
riding
white
horses
through
mountain
passes
there
were
no
clouds
in
my
dreams
or
if
there
were
any
they
were
clouds
that
had
been
cut
out
as
if
in
cardboard
with
scissors
i
had
shaken
off
all
belief
in
christianity
early
in
life
and
had
suffered
much
shelley
had
replaced
faith
by
reason
but
i
still
suffered
but
here
was
a
new
creed
which
proclaimed
the
divinity
of
the
body
and
for
a
long
time
the
reconstruction
of
all
my
theories
of
life
on
a
purely
pagan
basis
occupied
my
whole
attention
the
exquisite
outlines
of
the
marvellous
castle
the
romantic
woods
the
horses
moving
the
lovers
leaning
to
each
other
faces
enchanted
me
and
then
the
indescribably
beautiful
description
of
the
performance
of
you
like
and
the
supreme
relief
and
perfect
assuagement
it
brings
to
rodolph
who
then
sees
mdlle
de
maupin
for
the
first
time
in
attire
if
she
were
dangerously
beautiful
as
a
man
that
beauty
is
forgotten
in
the
rapture
and
praise
of
her
unmatchable
loveliness
but
if
mdlle
de
maupin
was
the
highest
peak
it
was
not
the
entire
mountain
the
range
was
long
and
each
summit
offered
to
the
eye
a
new
and
delightful
prospect
there
were
the
numerous
tales
tales
as
perfect
as
the
world
has
ever
seen
la
morte
amoureuse
jettatura
une
nuit
de
cléopâtre
and
then
the
very
diamonds
of
the
crown
les
emaux
et
camées
la
symphonie
en
blanc
majeure
in
which
the
adjective
and
is
repeated
with
miraculous
felicity
in
each
stanza
and
then
contralto
mais
seulement
il
se
transpose
et
passant
de
la
forme
au
son

dans
la
métamorphose
la
jeune
fille
et
le
garçon
a
word
never
before
used
except
in
musical
application
and
now
for
the
first
time
applied
to
material
form
and
with
a
touch
that
phidias
might
be
proud
of
i
know
not
how
i
quote
such
is
my
best
memory
of
the
stanza
and
here
that
is
more
important
than
the
stanza
itself
and
that
other
stanza
the
châtelaine
and
the
page
and
that
other
the
doves
and
that
other
romeo
and
juliet
and
the
exquisite
cadence
of
the
line
ending
novelists
have
often
shown
how
a
love
passion
brings
misery
despair
death
and
ruin
upon
a
life
but
i
know
of
no
story
of
the
good
or
evil
influence
awakened
by
the
chance
reading
of
a
book
the
chain
of
consequences
so
so
intensely
dramatic
never
shall
i
open
these
books
again
but
were
i
to
live
for
a
thousand
years
their
power
in
my
soul
would
remain
unshaken
i
am
what
they
made
me
belief
in
humanity
pity
for
the
poor
hatred
of
injustice
all
that
shelley
gave
may
never
have
been
very
deep
or
earnest
but
i
did
love
i
did
believe
gautier
destroyed
these
illusions
he
taught
me
that
our
boasted
progress
is
but
a
pitfall
into
which
the
race
is
falling
and
i
learned
that
the
correction
of
form
is
the
highest
ideal
and
i
accepted
the
plain
simple
conscience
of
the
pagan
world
as
the
perfect
solution
of
the
problem
that
had
vexed
me
so
long
i
cried
ave
to
it
all
lust
cruelty
slavery
and
i
would
have
held
down
my
thumbs
in
the
colosseum
that
a
hundred
gladiators
might
die
and
wash
me
free
of
my
christian
soul
with
their
blood
the
study
of
baudelaire
hurried
the
course
of
the
disease
no
longer
is
it
the
grand
barbaric
face
of
gautier
now
it
is
the
clean
shaven
face
of
the
mock
priest
the
slow
cold
eyes
and
the
sharp
cunning
sneer
of
the
cynical
libertine
who
will
be
tempted
that
he
may
better
know
the
worthlessness
of
temptation
les
fleurs
du
mal
beautiful
flowers
beautiful
in
sublime
decay
what
a
great
record
is
yours
and
were
hell
a
reality
how
many
souls
would
we
find
wreathed
with
your
poisonous
blossoms
the
village
maiden
goes
to
her
faust
the
children
of
the
nineteenth
century
go
to
you
o
baudelaire
and
having
tasted
of
your
deadly
delight
all
hope
of
repentance
is
vain
flowers
beautiful
in
your
sublime
decay
i
press
you
to
my
lips
these
northern
solitudes
far
from
the
rank
parisian
garden
where
i
gathered
you
are
full
of
you
even
as
the
of
the
sea
and
the
sun
that
sets
on
this
wild
moorland
evokes
the
magical
verse
un
soir
fait
de
rose
et
de
bleu
mystique
nous
échangerons
un
éclair
unique
comme
un
long
sanglot
tout
chargé
for
months
i
fed
on
the
mad
and
morbid
literature
that
the
enthusiasm
of
called
into
existence
the
gloomy
and
sterile
little
pictures
of
gaspard
de
la
nuit
or
the
elaborate
criminality
les
contes
immoraux
laboriously
invented
lifeless
things
with
creaky
joints
pitiful
lay
figures
that
fall
to
dust
as
soon
as
the
book
is
closed
and
in
the
dust
only
the
figures
of
the
terrible
ferryman
and
the
unfortunate
dora
remain
madame
potiphar
cost
me
forty
francs
and
i
never
read
more
than
a
few
pages
like
a
pike
after
minnows
i
pursued
the
works
of
les
jeune
france
along
the
quays
and
through
every
in
paris
the
money
spent
was
considerable
the
waste
of
time
vexatious
one
man
solitary
work
he
died
very
young
but
he
is
known
to
have
excelled
all
in
length
of
his
hair
and
the
redness
of
his
waistcoats
resisted
my
efforts
to
capture
it
at
last
i
caught
sight
of
the
precious
volume
in
a
shop
on
the
quai
voltaire
trembling
i
asked
the
price
the
man
looked
at
me
earnestly
and
answered
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
no
doubt
it
was
a
great
deal
of
money
but
i
paid
it
and
rushed
home
to
read
many
that
had
gone
before
had
proved
disappointing
and
i
was
obliged
to
admit
had
contributed
little
towards
my
intellectual
advancement
but
this
this
that
i
had
heard
about
so
long
not
a
queer
phrase
not
an
outrage
of
any
sort
of
kind
not
even
a
new
blasphemy
it
meant
nothing
to
me
that
is
to
say
nothing
but
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
having
thus
rudely
and
very
pikelike
knocked
my
nose
against
the
bottom
this
book
was
most
certainly
the
bottom
of
the
literature
of
i
came
up
to
the
surface
and
began
to
look
around
my
contemporaries
for
something
to
read
i
have
remarked
before
on
the
instinctiveness
of
my
likes
and
dislikes
on
my
susceptibility
to
the
sound
of
and
even
to
the
appearance
of
a
name
upon
paper
i
was
repelled
by
leconte
de
lisle
from
the
first
and
it
was
only
by
a
very
deliberate
outrage
to
my
feelings
that
i
bought
and
read
les
poèmes
antiques
and
les
poèmes
barbares
i
was
deceived
in
nothing
all
i
had
anticipated
i
found
long
desolate
boredom
leconte
de
lisle
produces
on
me
the
effect
of
a
walk
through
the
new
law
courts
with
a
steady
but
not
violent
draught
sweeping
from
end
to
end
oh
the
vile
old
professor
of
rhetoric
and
when
i
saw
him
the
last
time
i
was
in
paris
his
head
a
declaration
of
righteousness
a
cross
between
a
cæsar
by
gerome
and
an
archbishop
of
a
provincial
town
set
all
my
natural
antipathy
instantly
on
edge
hugo
is
often
pompous
shallow
empty
unreal
but
he
is
at
least
an
artist
and
when
he
thinks
of
the
artist
and
forgets
the
prophet
as
in
les
chansons
des
rues
et
des
bois
his
juggling
with
the
verse
is
magnificent
superb
comme
un
geai
sur
le
roi
se
tient
fier
son
cœur
est
de
marbre
son
ventre
est
de
chair
on
a
pour
sa
nuque
et
son
front
vermeil
fait
une
perruque
avec
le
soleil
il
règne
il
végète
effroyant
zéro
sur
lui
se
projette
du
bourreau
son
trône
est
une
tombe
et
sur
le
pavé
quelque
chose
en
tombe
point
lavé
but
how
to
get
the
first
line
of
the
last
stanza
into
five
syllables
i
can
not
think
if
ever
i
meet
with
the
volume
again
i
will
look
it
out
and
see
how
that
dompteur
de
managed
it
but
stay
trône
est
la
that
makes
the
verse
and
the
generalisation
would
be
in
the
line
of
hugo
hugo
how
impossible
it
is
to
speak
of
french
literature
without
referring
to
him
let
these
however
be
concluding
words
that
he
thought
he
could
by
saying
everything
and
saying
everything
twenty
times
over
for
ever
render
impossible
the
rehearsal
of
another
great
poet
but
a
work
of
art
is
valuable
and
pleasurable
in
proportion
to
its
rarity
one
beautiful
book
of
verses
is
better
than
twenty
books
of
beautiful
verses
this
is
an
absolute
and
incontestable
truth
a
child
can
burlesque
this
truth
one
verse
is
better
than
the
whole
poem
a
word
is
better
than
the
line
a
letter
is
better
than
the
word
but
the
truth
is
not
thereby
affected
hugo
never
had
the
good
fortune
to
write
a
bad
book
nor
even
a
single
bad
line
so
not
having
time
to
read
all
the
future
will
read
none
what
immortality
would
be
gained
by
the
destruction
of
one
half
of
his
magnificent
works
what
oblivion
is
secured
by
the
publication
of
these
posthumous
volumes
to
return
to
the
leconte
de
lisle
see
his
discours
de
réception
is
it
possible
to
imagine
anything
more
absurdly
arid
rhetoric
of
this
sort
vers
sur
une
éclume
and
such
sententious
platitudes
as
this
speaking
of
the
realists
épidémies
de
cette
nature
passent
et
le
génie
theodore
de
banville
at
first
i
thought
him
cold
infected
with
the
rhetorical
ice
of
the
leconte
de
lisle
he
had
no
new
creed
to
proclaim
nor
old
creed
to
denounce
the
inherent
miseries
of
human
life
did
not
seem
to
touch
him
nor
did
he
sing
the
languors
and
ardours
of
animal
or
spiritual
passion
but
there
is
this
a
pure
clear
song
an
instinctive
incurable
and
love
of
the
song
he
sings
of
the
white
lily
and
the
red
rose
such
knowledge
of
such
observation
of
nature
is
enough
for
the
poet
and
he
sings
and
he
trills
there
is
trilling
magic
in
every
song
and
the
song
as
it
ascends
rings
and
all
the
air
quivers
with
the
circle
of
the
echoes
sighing
and
dying
out
of
the
ear
until
the
last
faintness
is
reached
and
the
glad
rhymes
clash
and
dash
forth
again
on
their
aerial
way
banville
is
not
the
poet
he
is
the
bard
the
great
questions
that
agitate
the
mind
of
man
have
not
troubled
him
life
death
and
love
he
perceives
only
as
stalks
whereon
he
may
weave
his
glittering
web
of
living
words
whatever
his
moods
may
be
he
is
lyrical
his
wit
flies
out
on
wings
in
speaking
of
paul
alexis
book
le
besoin
he
said
avez
trouvé
un
titre
assez
laid
pour
faire
reculer
les
divines
i
know
not
what
instrument
to
compare
with
his
verse
i
suppose
i
should
say
a
flute
but
it
seems
to
me
more
like
a
marvellously
toned
piano
his
hands
pass
over
the
keys
and
he
produces
fluidities
it
is
now
well
known
that
french
verse
is
not
seventy
years
old
if
it
was
hugo
who
invented
french
rhyme
it
was
banville
who
broke
up
the
couplet
hugo
had
perhaps
ventured
to
place
the
pause
between
the
adjective
and
its
noun
but
it
was
not
until
banville
wrote
the
line
filait
pensivement
la
blanche
that
the
cæsura
received
its
final
de
this
verse
has
been
probably
more
imitated
than
any
other
verse
in
the
french
language
was
replaced
by
some
similar
adverb
tirait
nonchalamment
les
bas
de
soie
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
i
read
the
french
poets
of
the
modern
school
coppée
mendés
léon
diex
verlaine
josé
maria
hêrédia
mallarmé
richepin
villiers
de
adam
coppée
as
may
be
imagined
i
only
was
capable
of
appreciating
in
his
first
manner
when
he
wrote
those
exquisite
but
purely
artistic
sonnets
la
tulipe
and
le
lys
in
the
latter
a
room
decorated
with
daggers
armour
jewellery
and
china
is
beautifully
described
and
it
is
only
in
the
last
line
that
the
lily
which
animates
and
gives
life
to
the
whole
is
introduced
but
the
exquisite
poetic
perceptivity
coppée
showed
in
his
modern
poems
the
certainty
with
which
he
raised
the
commonest
subject
investing
it
with
sufficient
dignity
for
his
purpose
escaped
me
wholly
and
i
could
not
but
turn
with
horror
from
such
poems
as
la
nourrice
and
le
petit
epicier
how
anyone
could
bring
himself
to
acknowledge
the
vulgar
details
of
our
vulgar
age
i
could
not
understand
the
fiery
glory
of
josé
maria
de
hérédia
on
the
contrary
filled
me
with
enthusiasm
ruins
and
sand
shadow
and
silhouette
of
palms
and
pillars
negroes
crimson
swords
silence
and
arabesques
like
great
copper
pans
go
the
clangour
of
the
rhymes
entre
le
ciel
qui
brûle
et
la
mer
qui
moutonne
au
somnolent
soleil
midi
monotone
tu
songes
o
guerrière

vieux

et
dans

calmes
berçant
ta
gloire
éteinte
o
cité
tu
sous
les
palmiers
au
long
frémissement
des
palmes
catulle
mendès
a
perfect
realisation
of
his
name
with
his
pale
hair
and
his
fragile
face
illuminated
with
the
idealism
of
a
depraved
woman
he
takes
you
by
the
arm
by
the
hand
he
leans
towards
you
his
words
are
caresses
his
fervour
is
delightful
and
to
hear
him
is
as
sweet
as
drinking
a
smooth
perfumed
yellow
wine
all
he
says
is
false
the
book
he
has
just
read
the
play
he
is
writing
the
woman
who
loves
him
he
buys
a
packet
of
bonbons
in
the
streets
and
eats
them
and
it
is
false
an
exquisite
artist
physically
and
spiritually
he
is
art
he
is
the
muse
herself
or
rather
he
is
one
of
the
minions
of
the
muse
passing
from
flower
to
flower
he
goes
his
whole
nature
pulsing
with
butterfly
voluptuousness
he
has
written
poems
as
good
as
hugo
as
good
as
leconte
de
lisle
as
good
as
banville
as
good
as
baudelaire
as
good
as
gautier
as
good
as
coppée
he

a

sitting
round

on

i
have
met
none
whose
conversation
was
more
fruitful
but
with
the
exception
of
his
early
verses
i
can
not
say
i
ever
enjoyed
his
poetry
frankly
when
i
knew
him
he
had
published
the
celebrated
midi
faun
the
first
poem
written
in
accordance
with
the
theory
of
symbolism
but
when
it
was
given
to
me
this
marvellous
brochure
furnished
with
strange
illustrations
and
wonderful
tassels
i
thought
it
absurdly
obscure
since
then
however
it
has
been
rendered
by
force
of
contrast
with
the
enigmas
the
author
has
since
published
a
marvel
of
lucidity
i
am
sure
if
i
were
to
read
it
now
i
should
appreciate
its
many
beauties
it
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
author
later
work
as
to
but
what
is
symbolism
vulgarly
speaking
saying
the
opposite
to
what
you
mean
for
example
you
want
to
say
that
music
which
is
the
new
art
is
replacing
the
old
art
which
is

things

in

of

blunder

the

all

we
have
heard

christ

an
amusing
subject
for
poetry
and
strangely
enough
a
withdrawing
from
all
commerce
with
virtue
and
vice
is
it
would
seem
a
licentiousness
more
curiously
subtle
and
penetrating
than
any
other
and
the
licentiousness
of
the
verse
is
equal
to
that
of
the
emotion
every
natural
instinct
of
the
language
is
violated
and
the
simple
music
native
in
french
metre
is
replaced
by
falsetto

and

charm
is
that
of
an
odour
of

exhaled
by

of

my

although
durable
as
all
memories
of
him
must
be
but
that
marvellous
story
or
rather
study
has
been
blunted
in
my
knowledge
of
this
tiny
face
with
the
fine
masses
of
hair
drawn
up
from
the
neck
and
arranged
elaborately
on
the
crown
there
is
no
fear
of
plagiary
he
can
not
have
said
all
he
can
not
have
said
what
i
want
to
say
looking
at
this
face
so
mundane
so
intellectually
mundane
i
see
why
a
young
man
of
refined
mind
a
bachelor
who
spends
at
least
a
pound
a
day
on
his
pleasures
and
in
whose
library
are
found
some
few
volumes
of
modern
poetry
seeks
his
ideal
in
a
woman
of
thirty
it
is
clear
that
by
the
very
essence
of
her
being
the
young
girl
may
evoke
no
ideal
but
that
of
home
and
home
is
in
his
eyes
the
antithesis
of
freedom
desire
aspiration
he
longs
for
mystery
deep
and
endless
and
he
is
tempted
with
a
foolish
little
illusion
white
dresses
drawings
and
popular
music
he
dreams
of
pleasure
and
he
is
offered
duty
for
do
not
think
that
that
waist
does
not
suggest
to
him
a
yard
of
apron
string
cries
of
children
and
that
most
odious
word
papa
a
young
man
of
refined
mind
can
look
through
the
glass
of
the
years
he
has
sat
in
the
stalls
in
hand
he
has
met
women
of
thirty
at
balls
and
has
sat
with
them
beneath
shadowy
curtains
he
knows
that
the
world
is
full
of
beautiful
women
all
waiting
to
be
loved
and
amused
the
circles
of
his
immediate
years
are
filled
with
feminine
faces
they
cluster
like
flowers
on
this
side
and
that
and
they
fade
into
spaces
of
colour
how
many
may
love
him
the
loveliest
may
one
day
smile
upon
his
knee
and
shall
he
renounce
all
for
that
little
creature
who
has
just
finished
singing
and
is
handing
round
cups
of
tea
every
bachelor
contemplating
marriage
says
i
shall
have
to
give
up
all
for
one
one
the
young
girl
is
often
pretty
but
her
prettiness
is
vague
and
uncertain
it
inspires
a
sort
of
pitying
admiration
but
it
suggests
nothing
the
very
essence
of
the
young
girl
being
is
that
she
should
have
nothing
to
suggest
therefore
the
beauty
of
the
young
face
fails
to
touch
the
imagination
no
past
lies
hidden
in
those
translucent
eyes
no
story
of
hate
disappointment
or
sin
nor
is
there
in
nine
hundred
and
cases
in
a
thousand
any
doubt
that
the
hand
that
spends
at
least
a
pound
a
day
in
restaurants
and
cabs
will
succeed
in
gathering
the
muslin
flower
if
he
so
wills
it
and
by
doing
so
he
will
delight
every
one
where
then
is
the
struggle
where
then
is
the
triumph
therefore
i
say
that
if
a
young
man
heart
is
not
set
on
children
and
tiresome
the
young
girl
presents
to
him
no
possible
ideal
but
the
woman
of
thirty
presents
from
the
outset
all
that
is
necessary
to
ensnare
the
heart
of
a
young
man
i
see
her
sitting
in
her
beautiful
all
designed
by
and
all
belonging
to
her
her
chair
is
placed
beneath
an
evergreen
plant
and
the
long
leaves
lean
out
as
if
to
touch
her
neck
the
great
white
and
red
roses
of
the
aubusson
carpet
are
spread
enigmatically
about
her
feline
feet
a
grand
piano
leans
its
melodious
mouth
to
her
and
there
she
sits
when
her
visitors
have
left
her
playing
beethoven
sonatas
in
the
dreamy
firelight
the
shows
but
a
bloom
of
unvarying
freshness
august
has
languished
and
loved
in
the
strength
of
the
sun
she
is
stately
she
is
tall
what
sins
what
disappointments
what
aspirations
lie
in
those
grey
eyes
mysteriously
still
and
mysteriously
revealed
these
a
young
man
longs
to
know
of
they
are
his
life
he
imagines
himself
sitting
by
her
when
the
others
have
gone
holding
her
hand
calling
on
her
name
sometimes
she
moves
away
and
plays
the
moonlight
sonata
letting
her
hands
droop
upon
the
keys
she
talks
sadly
maybe
affectionately
she
speaks
of
the
tedium
of
life
of
its
disenchantments
he
knows
well
what
she
means
he
has
suffered
as
she
has
but
could
he
tell
her
could
she
understand
that
in
his
love
reality
would
dissolve
into
a
dream
all
limitations
would
open
into
boundless
infinity
the
husband
he
rarely
sees
sometimes
a
is
heard
about
six
the
man
is
thick
strong
common
his
jaws
are
heavy
his
eyes
are
expressionless
there
is
about
him
the
loud
swagger
of
the
and
he
suggests
the
inevitable
question
why
did
she
marry
him
a
question
that
every
young
man
of
refined
mind
asks
a
thousand
times
by
day
and
ten
thousand
times
by
night
asks
till
he
is
and
sees
that
his
generation
has
passed
into
middle
age
why
did
she
marry
him
not
the
sea
nor
the
sky
nor
the
great
mysterious
midnight
when
he
opens
his
casement
and
gazes
into
starry
space
will
give
him
answer
no
œdipus
will
ever
come
to
unravel
this
riddle
this
sphinx
will
never
throw
herself
from
the
rock
into
the
clangour
of
the
and
waves
she
will
never
divulge
her
secret
and
if
she
is
the
woman
and
not
a
woman
of
thirty
she
has
forgotten
the
young
man
shakes
hands
with
the
husband
he
strives
not
to
look
embarrassed
and
he
talks
of
indifferent
things
of
how
well
he
the
husband
is
looking
of
his
amusements
his
projects
and
then
he
the
young
man
of
refined
mind
tastes
of
that
keen
and
delight
happiness
in
crime
he
knows
not
the
details
of
her
home
life
the
husband
is
merely
a
dark
cloud
that
fills
one
side
of
the
picture
sometimes
obliterating
the
sunlight
a
shadowy
shape
that
in
certain
moments
solidifies
and
assumes
the
likeness
of
a
imminent
monster
but
the
shadow
and
the
shape
and
the
threat
are
magnetic
and
in
a
sense
of
danger
the
fascination
is
sealed
the
young
man
of
refined
mind
is
in
a
he
leans
against
the
woodwork
in
a
distant
doorway
hardly
knowing
what
to
do
with
himself
he
strives
to
interest
himself
in
the
conversation
of
a
group
of
men
twice
his
age
i
will
not
say
he
is
shunned
but
neither
the
matrons
nor
the
young
girls
make
any
advances
towards
him
the
young
girls
so
sweet
in
the
oneness
of
their
fresh
hair
flowers
dresses
and
glances
are
being
introduced
are
getting
up
to
dance
and
the
hostess
is
looking
round
for
partners
she
sees
the
young
man
in
the
doorway
but
she
hesitates
and
goes
to
some
one
else
and
if
you
asked
her
why
she
could
not
tell
you
why
she
avoided
him
presently
the
woman
of
thirty
enters
she
is
in
white
satin
and
diamonds
she
looks
for
him
a
circular
glance
calm
with
possession
she
passes
to
a
seat
extending
her
hand
here
and
there
she
dances
the
eighth
twelfth
and
fifteenth
waltz
with
him
will
he
induce
her
to
visit
his
rooms
will
they
be
like
marshall
strange
debauches
of
colour
and
turkish
lamps
or
mine
an
old
cabinet
a
faded
pastel
which
embalms
the
memory
of
a
pastoral
century
my
taste
or
will
it
be
a
library
two
leather
library
chairs
a
large
escritoire
be
this
as
it
may
whether
the
apartments
be
the
ruthless
extravagance
of
artistic
impulse
or
the
subdued
taste
of
the
student
she
the
woman
of
thirty
shall
be
there
by
night
and
day
her
statue
is
there
and
even
when
she
is
sleeping
safe
in
her
arms
with
fevered
brow
he
the
young
man
of
refined
mind
alone
and
lonely
shall
kneel
and
adore
her
and
should
she
visit
his
rooms
if
the
complex
and
various
accidents
of
existence
should
have
ruled
out
her
life
virtuously
if
the
many
inflections
of
sentiment
have
decided
against
this
last
consummation
then
she
will
wax
to
the
complete
the
unfathomable
temptress
the
lilith
of
old
she
will
never
set
him
free
and
in
the
end
will
be
found
about
his
heart
one
single
golden
hair
she
shall
haunt
his
wife
face
and
words
should
he
seek
to
rid
himself
of
her
by
marriage
a
bitter
sweet
a
enchantment
she
shall
consume
and
destroy
the
strength
and
spirit
of
his
life
leaving
it
desolation
a
barren
landscape
burnt
and
faintly
scented
with
the
sea
fame
and
wealth
shall
slip
like
sand
from
him
she
may
be
set
aside
for
the
cadence
of
a
rhyme
for
the
flowing
line
of
a
limb
but
when
the
passion
of
art
has
raged
itself
out
she
shall
return
to
blight
the
peace
of
the
worker
a
terrible
malady
is
she
a
malady
the
ancients
knew
of
and
called
nympholepsy
a
beautiful
name
evocative
and
symbolic
of
its
ideal
aspect
the
breasts
of
the
nymphs
in
the
brake
and
the
disease
is
not
extinct
in
these
modern
days
nor
will
it
ever
be
so
long
as
men
shall
yearn
for
the
unattainable
and
the
prosy
bachelors
who
trail
their
lives
from
their
chambers
to
their
clubs
know
their
malady
and
they
call
it
the
woman
of
thirty
viii
a
japanese
the
ideality
of
whose
tissue
delights
me
some
fresh
honey
and
milk
set
by
this
couch
hung
with
royal
fringes
and
having
partaken
of
this
odorous
refreshment
i
call
to
jack
my
great
python
crawling
about
after
a
two
months
fast
i
tie
up

pure

the
little

and
squeaks

his
black

how
superb

he
strikes
and
with
what
exquisite
gourmandise
he
lubricates
and
swallows
marshall
is
at
the
organ
in
the
hall
he
is
playing
a
gregorian
chant
that
beautiful
hymn
the
vexilla
regis
by
saint
fortunatus
the
great
poet
of
the
middle
ages
and
having
turned
over
the
leaves
of
les
fêtes
galantes
i
sit
down
to
write
my
original
intention
was
to
write
some
thirty
or
forty
stories
varying
from
thirty
to
three
hundred
lines
in
length
the
nature
of
these
stories
is
easy
to
imagine
there
was
the
youth
who
wandered
by
night
into
a
witches
sabbath
and
was
disputed
for
by
the
witches
young
and
old
there
was
the
light
o
love
who
went
into
the
desert
to
tempt
the
holy
man
but
he
died
as
he
yielded
his
arms
stiffened
by
some
miracle
and
she
was
unable
to
free
herself
she
died
of
starvation
as
her
bondage
loosened
in
decay
i
had
increased
my
difficulties
by
adopting
as
part
of
my
task
the
introduction
of
all
sorts
of
elaborate
and
in
many
cases
extravagantly
composed
metres
and
i
had
begun
to
feel
that
i
was
working
in
sand
i
could
make
no
progress
the
house
i
was
raising
crumbled
and
fell
away
on
every
side
these
stories
had
one
merit
they
were
all
so
far
as
i
can
remember
perfectly
constructed
for
the
art
of
telling
a
story
clearly
and
dramatically
les
procédés
de
i
had
thoroughly
learnt
from
old
duval
the
author
of
a
hundred
and
sixty
plays
written
in
collaboration
with
more
than
a
hundred
of
the
best
writers
of
his
day
including
the
master
himself
gautier
i
frequently
met
duval
at
breakfast
at
a
neighbouring
and
our
conversation
turned
on
de
la
pièce
préparer
la
situation
nous
aurons
des
etc
one
day
as
i
sat
waiting
for
him
i
took
up
the
it
contained
an
article
by
zola
la
vérité
la
science
were
repeated
some
times
hardly
able
to
believe
my
eyes
i
read
that
you
should
write
with
as
little
imagination
as
possible
that
plot
in
a
novel
or
in
a
play
was
illiterate
and
puerile
and
that
the
art
of
scribe
was
an
art
of
strings
and
wires
etc
i
rose
up
from
breakfast
ordered
my
coffee
and
stirred
the
sugar
a
little
dizzy
like
one
who
has
received
a
violent
blow
on
the
head
words
heard
in
an
unexpected
quarter
but
applying
marvellously
well
to
the
besetting
difficulty
of
the
moment
the
reader
who
has
followed
me
so
far
will
remember
the
instant
effect
the
word
shelley
had
upon
me
in
childhood
and
how
it
called
into
existence
a
train
of
feeling
that
illuminated
the
vicissitudes
and
passions
of
many
years
until
it
was
finally
assimilated
and
became
part
of
my
being
the
reader
will
also
remember
how
the
mere
mention
at
a
certain
moment
of
the
word
france
awoke
a
vital
impulse
even
a
sense
of
final
ordination
and
how
the
irrevocable
message
was
obeyed
and
how
it
led
to
the
creation
of
a
mental
existence
and
now
for
a
third
time
i
experienced
the
pain
and
joy
of
a
sudden
and
inward
light
naturalism
truth
the
new
art
above
all
the
phrase
the
new
art
impressed
me
as
with
a
sudden
sense
of
light
i
was
dazzled
and
i
vaguely
understood
that
my
roses
of
midnight
were
sterile
eccentricities
dead
flowers
that
could
not
be
galvanised
into
any
semblance
of
life
passionless
in
all
their
passion
i
had
read
a
few
chapters
of
the
assommoir
as
it
appeared
in
république
des
i
had
cried
ridiculous
abominable
only
because
it
is
characteristic
of
me
to
instantly
form
an
opinion
and
assume
at
once
a
violent
attitude
but
now
i
bought
up
the
back
numbers
of
the
and
i
looked
forward
to
the
weekly
exposition
of
the
new
faith
with
febrile
eagerness
the
great
zeal
with
which
the
new
master
continued
his
propaganda
and
the
marvellous
way
in
which
subjects
the
most
diverse
passing
events
political
social
religious
were
caught
up
and
turned
into
arguments
for
or
proof
of
the
truth
of
naturalism
astonished
me
wholly
the
idea
of
a
new
art
based
upon
science
in
opposition
to
the
art
of
the
old
world
that
was
based
on
imagination
an
art
that
should
explain
all
things
and
embrace
modern
life
in
its
entirety
in
its
endless
ramifications
be
as
it
were
a
new
creed
in
a
new
civilisation
filled
me
with
wonder
and
i
stood
dumb
before
the
vastness
of
the
conception
and
the
towering
height
of
the
ambition
in
my
fevered
fancy
i
saw
a
new
race
of
writers
that
would
arise
and
with
the
aid
of
the
novel
would
continue
to
a
more
glorious
and
legitimate
conclusion
the
work
that
the
prophets
had
begun
and
at
each
development
of
the
theory
of
the
new
art
and
its
universal
applicability
my
wonder
increased
and
my
admiration
choked
me
if
any
one
should
be
tempted
to
turn
to
the
books
themselves
to
seek
an
explanation
of
this
wild
ecstasy
he
would
find
nothing
as
well
drink
the
dregs
of
yesterday
champagne
one
is
lying
before
me
now
and
as
i
glance
through
the
pages
listlessly
i
say
only
the
simple
crude
statements
of
a
man
of
powerful
mind
but
singularly
narrow
vision
still
although
eager
and
anxious
for
the
fray
i
did
not
see
how
i
was
to
participate
in
it
i
was
not
a
novelist
not
yet
a
dramatic
author
and
the
possibility
of
a
naturalistic
poet
seemed
to
me
not
a
little
doubtful
i
had
clearly
understood
that
the
lyrical
quality
was
to
be
for
ever
banished
there
were
to
be
no
harps
and
lutes
in
our
heaven
only
drums
and
the
preservation
of
all
the
essentials
of
poetry
by
the
simple
enumeration
of
the
utensils
to
be
found
in
a
back
kitchen
sounded
i
could
not
help
thinking
here
it
becomes
necessary
to
whisper
not
unlike
rigmarole
i
waited
for
the
master
to
speak
he
had
declared
that
the
republic
would
fall
if
it
did
not
become
instantly
naturalistic
he
would
not
he
could
not
pass
over
in
silence
so
important
a
branch
of
literature
as
poetry
no
matter
how
contemptible
he
might
think
it
if
he
could
find
nothing
to
praise
he
must
at
least
condemn
at
last
the
expected
article
came
it
was
all
that
could
be
desired
by
one
in
my
fever
of
mind
hugo
claims
had
been
previously
disproven
but
now
banville
and
gautier
were
declared
to
be
dishes
of
the
ancient
world
baudelaire
was
a
naturalist
but
he
had
been
spoilt
by
the
romantic
influence
of
his
generation
there
were
indications
of
the
naturalistic
movement
even
in
poetry
i
trembled
with
excitement
i
could
not
read
fast
enough
coppée
had
striven
to
simplify
language
he
had
versified
the
street
cries
la
france
le
soir
le
he
had
sought
to
give
utterance
to
humble
sentiments
as
in
le
petit
epicier
de
montrouge
the
little
grocer
cassait
le
sucre
avec
richepin
had
boldly
and
frankly
adopted
the
language
of
the
people
in
all
its
superb
crudity
all
this
was
however
preparatory
and
tentative
we
are
waiting
for
our
poet
he
who
will
sing
to
us
fearlessly
of
the
rude
industry
of
dustmen
and
the
comestible
glories
of
the
the
subjects
are
to
hand
the
formula
alone
is
wanting
the
prospect
dazzled
me
i
tried
to
calm
myself
had
i
the
stuff
in
me
to
win
and
to
wear
these
bays
this
stupendous
laurel
crown
bays
laurel
crown
a
distinct
of
parnassus
but
there
is
no
modern
equivalent
i
must
strive
to
invent
a
new
one
in
the
meantime
let
me
think
true
it
is
that
swinburne
was
before
me
with
the
romantiques
the
hymn
to
proserpine
and
dolores
are
wonderful
lyrical
versions
of
mdlle
de
maupin
in
form
the
leper
is
old
english
the
colouring
is
baudelaire
but
the
rude
industry
of
the
dustmen
and
the
comestible
glories
of
the
shall
be
mine
bas
les
roses
de
minuit
i
felt
the
naturalisation
of
the
roses
of
midnight
would
prove
a
difficult
task
i
soon
found
it
an
impossible
one
and
i
laid
the
poems
aside
and
commenced
a
volume
redolent
of
the
delights
of
bougival
and
ville
this
book
was
to
be
entitled
poems
of
and
blood
mit
son
plus
beau
chapeau
son
chapeau
and
then
why
then
picking
up
her
skirt
she
threads
her
way
through
the
crowded
streets
reads
the
advertisements
on
the
walls
hails
the
omnibus
inquires
at
the
loge
murmurs
as
she
goes
upstairs
haut
le
and
then
why
the
door
opens
and
she
cries
but
it
was
the
idea
of
the
new
æstheticism
the
new
art
corresponding
to
modern
as
ancient
art
corresponded
to
ancient
life
that
captivated
me
that
led
me
away
and
not
a
substantial
knowledge
of
the
work
done
by
the
naturalists
i
had
read
the
assommoir
and
had
been
much
impressed
by
its
pyramid
size
strength
height
and
decorative
grandeur
and
also
by
the
immense
harmonic
development
of
the
idea
and
the
fugal
treatment
of
the
different
scenes
had
seemed
to
me
astonishingly
new
the
washhouse
for
example
the
fight
motive
is
indicated
then
follows
the
development
of
side
issues
then
comes
the
fight
motive
explained
it
is
broken
off
short
it
flutters
through
a
web
of
progressive
detail
the
fight
motive
is
again
taken
up
and
now
it
is
worked
out
in
all
its
fulness
it
is
worked
up
to
another
side
issue
is
introduced
and
again
the
theme
is
given
forth
and
i
marvelled
greatly
at
the
lordly
roll
of
the
narrative
sometimes
widening
out
into
lakes
and
shallowing
meres
but
never
stagnating
in
fen
or
marshlands
the
language
too
which
i
did
not
then
recognise
as
the
weak
point
being
little
more
than
a
boiling
down
of
chateaubriand
and
flaubert
spiced
with
goncourt
delighted
me
with
its
novelty
its
richness
its
force
nor
did
i
then
even
roughly
suspect
that
the
very
qualities
which
set
my
admiration
in
a
blaze
wilder
than
wildfire
being
precisely
those
that
had
won
the
victory
for
the
romantic
school
forty
years
before
were
very
antagonistic
to
those
claimed
for
the
new
art
i
was
deceived
as
was
all
my
generation
by
a
certain
externality
an
outer
skin
a
nearness
in
a
word
by
a
substitution
of
paris
for
the
distant
and
exotic
backgrounds
so
beloved
of
the
romantic
school
i
did
not
know
then
as
i
do
now
that
art
is
eternal
that
it
is
only
the
artist
that
changes
and
that
the
two
great
divisions
the
only
possible
divisions
are
those
who
have
talent
and
those
who
have
no
talent
but
i
do
not
regret
my
errors
my
follies
it
is
not
well
to
know
at
once
of
the
limitations
of
life
and
things
i
should
be
less
than
nothing
had
it
not
been
for
my
enthusiasms
they
were
the
saving
clause
in
my
life
but
although
i
am
apt
to
love
too
dearly
the
art
of
my
day
and
to
the
disparagement
of
that
of
other
days
i
did
not
fall
into
the
fatal
mistake
of
placing
the
realistic
writers
of
side
by
side
with
and
on
the
same
plane
of
intellectual
vision
as
the
great
balzac
i
felt
that
that
vast
immemorial
mind
rose
above
them
all
like
a
mountain
above
the
highest
tower
and
strange
to
say
it
was
gautier
that
introduced
me
to
balzac
for
mention
is
made
in
the
wonderful
preface
to
les
fleurs
du
mal
of
seraphita
seraphita
seraphitus
which
is
it
woman
or
man
should
wilfred
or
mona
be
the
possessor
a
new
mdlle
de
maupin
with
royal
lily
and
aureole
mountains
great
gulfs
of
flowing
up
and
reflecting
as
in
a
mirror
the
steep
cliff
side
the
straight
white
feet
are
set
thereon
the
obscuring
weft
of
flesh
is
torn
and
the
pure
strange
soul
continues
its
mystical
exhortations
then
the
radiant
vision
a
white
glory
the
last
outburst
and
manifestation
the
trumpets
of
the
apocalypse
the
colour
of
heaven
the
closing
of
this
stupendous
allegory
seraphita
lying
dead
in
the
rays
of
the
first
sun
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
therefore
had
begun
as
it
were
to
read
balzac
backwards
instead
of
beginning
with
the
plain
simple
earthly
tragedy
of
the
père
goriot
i
first
knelt
in
a
beautiful
but
distant
coigne
of
the
great
world
of
his
genius
seraphita
certain
of
soul
are
characteristic
of
certain
latitudes
and
what
subtle
instinct
led
him
to
norway
in
quest
of
this
fervent
soul
the
instincts
of
genius
are
unfathomable
but
he
who
has
known
the
white
northern
women
with
their
pure
spiritual
eyes
will
aver
that
instinct
led
him
aright
i
have
known
one
one
whom
i
used
to
call
seraphita
coppée
knew
her
too
and
that
exquisite
volume
so
in
the
keen
blonde
passion
of
its
verse
was
written
to
her
and
each
poem
was
sent
to
her
as
it
was
written
where
is
she
now
that
flower
of
northern
snow
once
seen
for
a
season
in
paris
has
she
returned
to
her
native
northern
solitudes
great
gulfs
of
sea
water
mountain
rock
and
pine
balzac

is
in
his
titles
as

is
in
its
stars
melmoth

that
had
appeared
in
france
since
pascal
of
pascal
claim
to
be
a
great
thinker
i
confess
i
can
not
judge
no
man
is
greater
than
the
age
he
lives
in
and
therefore
to
talk
to
us
the
legitimate
children
of
the
nineteenth
century
of
logical
proofs
of
the
existence
of
god
strikes
us
in
just
the
same
light
as
the
logical
proof
of
the
existence
of
jupiter
ammon
les
pensées
could
appear
to
me
only
as
infinitely
childish
the
form
is
no
doubt
superb
but
tiresome
and
sterile
to
one
of
such
modern
and
exotic
taste
as
myself
still
i
accept
thankfully
in
its
sense
of
two
hundred
years
the
compliment
paid
to
balzac
but
i
would
add
that
personally
he
seems
to
me
to
have
shown
greater
wings
of
mind
than
any
artist
that
ever
lived
i
am
aware
that
this
last
statement
will
make
many
cry
fool
and
hiss
shakespeare
but
i
am
not
putting
forward
these
criticisms
axiomatically
but
only
as
the
expressions
of
an
individual
taste
and
interesting
so
far
as
they
reveal
to
the
reader
the
different
developments
and
the
progress
of
my
mind
it
might
prove
a
little
tiresome
but
it
would
no
doubt
look
well
in
the
sense
that
going
to
church
looks
well
if
i
were
to
write
in
here
ten
pages
of
praise
of
our
national
bard
i
must
however
resist
the
temptation
to
look
well
a
confession
is
interesting
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
truth
it
contains
and
i
will
therefore
state
frankly
i
never
derived
any
profit
whatsoever
and
very
little
pleasure
from
the
reading
of
the
great
plays
the
beauty
of
the
verse
yes
he
who
loved
shelley
so
well
as
i
could
not
fail
to
hear
the
melody
of
music
to
hear
why
hearest
thou
music
sadly
sweets
with
sweets
war
not
joy
delights
in
joy
is
not
such
music
as
this
enough
of
course
but
i
am
a
sensualist
in
literature
i
may
see
perfectly
well
that
this
or
that
book
is
a
work
of
genius
but
if
it
does
fetch
me
it
does
concern
me
and
i
forget
its
very
existence
what
leaves
me
cold
will
madden
me
with
me
literature
is
a
question
of
sense
intellectual
sense
if
you
will
but
sense
all
the
same
and
ruled
by
the
same
caprices
those
of
the
flesh
now
we
enter
on
very
subtle
distinctions
no
doubt
that
there
is
the
and
the
of
a
work
of
art
and
it
will
be
noticed
that
these
two
forces
of
discrimination
exist
sometimes
almost
independently
of
each
other
in
rare
and
radiant
instances
confounded
and
blended
in
one
immense
and
unique
love
who
has
not
been
unless
perhaps
some
dusty
old
pedant
thrilled
and
driven
to
pleasure
by
the
action
of
a
book
that
penetrates
to
and
speaks
to
you
of
your
most
present
and
most
intimate
emotions
this
is
of
course
pure
sensualism
but
to
take
a
less
marked
stage
why
should
marlowe
enchant
me
why
should
he
delight
and
awake
enthusiasm
in
me
while
shakespeare
leaves
me
cold
the
mind
that
can
understand
one
can
understand
the
other
but
there
are
affinities
in
literature
corresponding
to
and
very
analogous
to
sexual
affinities
the
same
unreasoned
attractions
the
same
pleasures
the
same
lassitudes
those
we
have
loved
most
we
are
most
indifferent
to
shelley
gautier
zola
flaubert
goncourt
how
i
have
loved
you
all
and
now
i
could
not
would
not
read
you
again
how
womanly
how
capricious
but
even
a
capricious
woman
is
constant
if
not
faithful
to
her
de
and
so
with
me
of
those
i
have
loved
deeply
there
is
but
one
that
still
may
thrill
me
with
the
old
passion
with
the
first
ecstasy
it
is
balzac
upon
that
rock
i
built
my
church
and
his
great
and
valid
talent
saved
me
often
from
destruction
saved
me
from
the
shoaling
waters
of
new
æstheticisms
the
putrid
mud
of
naturalism
and
the
faint
and
sickly
surf
of
the
symbolists
thinking
of
him
i
could
not
forget
that
it
is
the
spirit
and
not
the
flesh
that
is
eternal
that
as
it
was
thought
that
in
the
first
instance
gave
man
speech
so
to
the
end
it
shall
still
be
thought
that
shall
make
speech
beautiful
and
rememberable
the
grandeur
and
sublimity
of
balzac
thoughts
seem
to
me
to
rise
to
the
loftiest
heights
and
his
range
is
limitless
there
is
no
passion
he
has
not
touched
and
what
is
more
marvellous
he
has
given
to
each
in
art
a
place
equivalent
to
the
place
it
occupies
in
nature
his
intense
and
penetrating
sympathy
for
human
life
and
all
that
concerns
it
enabled
him
to
surround
the
humblest
subjects
with
awe
and
crown
them
with
the
light
of
tragedy
there
are
some
particularly
those
who
can
understand
neither
and
can
read
but
one
who
will
object
to
any
comparison
being
drawn
between
the
dramatist
and
the
novelist
but
i
confess
that
i
if
the
inherent
superiority
of
verse
over
prose
which
i
admit
unhesitatingly
be
waived
that
i
fail
utterly
fail
to
see
in
what
shakespeare
is
greater
than
balzac
the
range
of
the
poet
thought
is
of
necessity
not
so
wide
and
his
concessions
must
needs
be
greater
than
the
novelist
on
these
points
we
will
cry
quits
and
come
at
once
to
the
vital
question
the
creation
is
lucien
inferior
to
hamlet
is
eugénie
grandet
inferior
to
desdemona
is
her
father
inferior
to
shylock
is
macbeth
inferior
to
vautrin
can
it
be
said
that
the
apothecary
in
the
cousine
bette
or
the
baron
hulot
or
the
cousine
bette
herself
is
inferior
to
anything
the
brain
of
man
has
ever
conceived
and
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
shakespeare
has
had
three
hundred
years
and
the
advantage
of
stage
representation
to
impress
his
characters
on
the
sluggish
mind
of
the
world
and
as
mental
impressions
are
governed
by
the
same
laws
of
gravitation
as
atoms
our
realisation
of
falstaff
must
of
necessity
be
more
vivid
than
any
character
in
contemporary
literature
although
it
were
equally
great
and
so
far
as
epigram
and
aphorism
are
concerned
and
here
i
speak
with
absolute
sincerity
and
conviction
the
work
of
the
novelist
seems
to
me
richer
than
that
of
the
dramatist
who
shall
forget
those
terrible
words
of
the
poor
orphan
in
the
speaking
of
vautrin
she
says
his
look
frightens
me
as
if
he
put
his
hand
on
my
dress
and
another
epigram
from
the
same
book
woman
virtue
is
man
greatest
invention
find
me
anything
in
la
rochefoucauld
that
goes
more
incisively
to
the
truth
of
things
one
more
here
i
can
give
the
exact
words
gloire
est
le
soleil
des
it
would
be
easy
to
compile
a
book
of
sayings
from
balzac
that
would
make
all
maximes
and
pensées
even
those
of
la
rochefoucauld
or
joubert
seem
trivial
and
shallow
balzac
was
the
great
moral
influence
of
my
life
and
my
reading
culminated
in
the
comédie
humaine
i
no
doubt
fluttered
through
some
scores
of
other
books
of
prose
and
verse
sipping
a
little
honey
but
he
alone
left
any
important
or
lasting
impression
upon
my
mind
the
rest
was
like
walnuts
and
wine
an
agreeable
aftertaste
but
notwithstanding
all
this
reading
i
can
lay
no
claim
to
scholarship
of
any
kind
for
save
life
i
could
never
learn
anything
correctly
i
am
a
student
only
of
ball
rooms
bar
rooms
streets
and
alcoves
i
have
read
very
little
but
all
i
read
i
can
turn
to
account
and
all
i
read
i
remember
to
read
freely
extensively
has
always
been
my
ambition
and
my
utter
inability
to
study
has
always
been
to
me
a
subject
of
grave
inquietude
study
as
contrasted
with
a
general
and
haphazard
gathering
of
ideas
taken
in
flight
but
in
me
the
impulse
is
so
original
to
frequent
the
haunts
of
men
that
it
is
irresistible
conversation
is
the
breath
of
my
nostrils
i
watch
the
movement
of
life
and
my
ideas
spring
from
it
uncalled
for
as
buds
from
branches
contact
with
the
world
is
in
me
the
generating
force
without
this
what
invention
i
have
is
thin
and
sterile
and
it
grows
thinner
rapidly
until
it
dies
away
utterly
as
it
did
in
the
composition
of
my
unfortunate
roses
of
midnight
men
and
women
oh
the
strength
of
the
living
faces
conversation
oh
the
magic
of
it
it
is
a
fabulous
river
of
gold
where
the
precious
metal
is
washed
up
without
stint
for
all
to
take
to
take
as
much
as
he
can
carry
two
old
ladies
discussing
the
peerage
much
may
be
learned
it
is
gold
poets
and
wits
then
it
is
fountains
whose
spray
solidifies
into
jewels
and
every
herb
and
plant
is
begemmed
with
the
sparkle
of
the
diamond
and
the
glow
of
the
ruby
i
did
not
go
to
either
oxford
or
cambridge
but
i
went
to
the
nouvelle
athènes
what
is
the
nouvelle
athènes
he
who
would
know
anything
of
my
life
must
know
something
of
the
academy
of
the
fine
arts
not
the
official
stupidity
you
read
of
in
the
daily
papers
but
the
real
french
academy
the
the
nouvelle
athènes
is
a
on
the
place
pigale
ah
the
morning
idlenesses
and
the
long
evenings
when
life
was
but
a
summer
illusion
the
grey
moonlights
on
the
place
where
we
used
to
stand
on
the
pavements
the
shutters
clanging
up
behind
us
loath
to
separate
thinking
of
what
we
had
left
said
and
how
much
better
we
might
have
enforced
our
arguments
dead
and
scattered
are
all
those
who
used
to
assemble
there
and
those
years
and
our
home
for
it
was
our
home
live
only
in
a
few
pictures
and
a
few
pages
of
prose
the
same
old
story
the
vanquished
only
are
victorious
and
though
unacknowledged
though
unknown
the
influence
of
the
nouvelle
athènes
is
inveterate
in
the
artistic
thought
of
the
nineteenth
century
how
magnetic
intense
and
vivid
are
these
memories
of
youth
with
what
strange
almost
unnatural
clearness
do
i
see
and
hear
see
the
white
face
of
that
the
white
nose
of
that
block
of
houses
stretching
up
to
the
place
between
two
streets
i
can
see
down
the
incline
of
those
two
streets
and
i
know
what
shops
are
there
i
can
hear
the
glass
door
of
the
grate
on
the
sand
as
i
open
it
i
can
recall
the
smell
of
every
hour
in
the
morning
that
of
eggs
frizzling
in
butter
the
pungent
cigarette
coffee
and
bad
cognac
at
five
the
fragrant
odour
of
absinthe
and
soon
after
the
steaming
soup
ascends
from
the
kitchen
and
as
the
evening
advances
the
mingled
smells
of
cigarettes
coffee
and
weak
beer
a
partition
rising
a
few
feet
or
more
over
the
hats
separates
the
glass
front
from
the
main
body
of
the
the
usual
marble
tables
are
there
and
it
is
there
we
sat
and
æstheticised
till
two
in
the
morning
but
who
is
that
man
he
whose
prominent
eyes
flash
with
excitement
that
is
villiers
de
the
last
or
the
supposed
last
of
the
great
family
he
is
telling
that
girl
a
story
that
fair
girl
with
heavy
eyelids
stupid
and
sensual
she
is
however
genuinely
astonished
and
interested
and
he
is
striving
to
play
upon
her
ignorance
listen
to
him
spain
the
night
is
fragrant
with
the
sea
and
the
perfume
of
the
orange
trees
you
know
a
midnight
of
stars
and
dreams
now
and
then
the
silence
is
broken
by
the
sentries
challenging
that
is
all
but
not
in
spanish
but
in
french
are
the
challenges
given
the
town
is
in
the
hands
of
the
french
it
is
under
martial
law
but
now
an
officer
passes
down
a
certain
garden
a
spaniard
disguised
as
a
french
officer
from
the
balcony
the
family
one
of
the
most
noble
and
oldest
families
spain
can
boast
of
a
thousand
years
long
before
the
conquest
of
the
moors
watches
him
well
then
villiers
sweeps
with
a
white
feminine
hand
the
long
hair
that
is
falling
over
his
face
he
has
half
forgotten
he
is
a
little
mixed
in
the
opening
of
the
story
and
he
is
striving
in
english
to
scamp
in
french
to
the
family
are
watching
death
if
he
is
caught
if
he
fails
to
kill
the
french
sentry
the
cry
of
a
bird
some
vague
sound
attracts
the
sentry
he
turns
all
is
lost
the
spaniard
is
seized
martial
law
spanish
conspiracy
must
be
put
down
the
french
general
is
a
man
of
iron
villiers
laughs
a
short
hesitating
laugh
that
is
characteristic
of
him
and
continues
in
his
abrupt
uncertain
way
man
of
iron
not
only
he
declares
that
the
spy
must
be
beheaded
but
also
the
entire
family
a
man
of
iron
that
ha
ha
and
then
no
you
can
not
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
understand
the
enormity
of
the
calamity
a
thousand
years
before
the
conquest
by
the
moors
a
spaniard
alone
could
there
is
no
one
here
ha
ha
i
was
forgetting
the
utter
extinction
of
a
great
family
of
the
name
the
oldest
and
noblest
of
all
the
families
in
spain
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
that
no
not
easy
here
in
the
athènes
ha
ha
one
must
belong
to
a
great
family
to
understand
ha
ha
the
father
beseeches
he
begs
that
one
member
may
be
spared
to
continue
the
name
the
youngest
son
that
is
all
if
he
could
be
saved
the
rest
what
matter
death
is
nothing
to
a
spaniard
the
family
the
name
a
thousand
years
of
name
is
everything
the
general
is
you
know
a
of
iron
one
member
of
your
family
shall
be
respited
but
on
one
condition
to
the
agonised
family
conditions
are
as
nothing
but
they
do
know
the
man
of
iron
is
determined
to
make
a
terrible
example
and
they
cry
conditions
who
is
respited
must
serve
as
executioner
to
the
others
great
is
the
doom
you
understand
but
after
all
the
name
must
be
saved
then
in
the
family
council
the
father
goes
to
his
youngest
son
and
says
have
been
a
good
father
to
you
my
son
i
have
always
been
a
kind
father
have
i
not
answer
me
i
have
never
refused
you
anything
now
you
will
not
fail
us
you
will
prove
yourself
worthy
of
the
great
name
you
bear
remember
your
great
ancestor
who
defeated
the
moors
remember
villiers
strives
to
get
in
a
little
local
colour
but
his
knowledge
of
spanish
names
and
history
is
limited
and
he
in
a
certain
sense
fails
then
the
mother
comes
to
her
son
and
says
son
i
have
been
a
good
mother
i
have
always
loved
you
say
you
will
not
desert
us
in
this
hour
of
our
great
need
then
the
little
sister
comes
and
the
whole
family
kneels
down
and
appeals
to
the
boy
will
not
prove
himself
unworthy
of
our
name
cries
the
father
my
son
courage
take
the
axe
firmly
do
what
i
ask
you
courage
strike
straight
the
father
head
falls
into
the
sawdust
the
blood
all
over
the
white
beard
then
comes
the
elder
brother
and
then
another
brother
and
then
oh
the
little
sister
was
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
and
the
mother
had
to
whisper
your
promise
to
your
father
to
your
dead
father
the
mother
laid
her
head
on
the
block
but
he
could
not
strike
not
the
first
coward
of
our
name
strike
remember
your
promise
to
us
all
and
her
head
was
struck
off
and
the
son
the
girl
asks
what
became
of
him
he
never
was
seen
save
at
night
walking
a
solitary
man
beneath
the
walls
of
his
castle
in
granada
and
whom
did
he
marry
he
never
married
then
after
a
long
silence
some
one
said
whose
story
is
that
balzac
at
that
moment
the
glass
door
of
the
grated
upon
the
sanded
floor
and
manet
entered
although
by
birth
and
by
art
essentially
parisian
there
was
something
in
his
appearance
and
manner
of
speaking
that
often
suggested
an
englishman
perhaps
it
was
his
dress
his
clothes
and
figure
that
figure
those
square
shoulders
that
swaggered
as
he
went
across
a
room
and
the
thin
waist
and
that
face
the
beard
and
nose
shall
i
say
no
for
i
would
evoke
an
idea
of
beauty
of
line
united
to
that
of
intellectual
expression
frank
words
frank
passion
in
his
convictions
loyal
and
simple
phrases
clear
as
sometimes
a
little
hard
sometimes
as
they
flowed
away
bitter
but
at
the
fountain
head
sweet
and
full
of
light
he
sits
next
to
degas
that
man
in
suit
of
pepper
and
salt
there
is
nothing
very
trenchantly
french
about
him
either
except
the
large
necktie
his
eyes
are
small
and
his
words
are
sharp
ironical
cynical
these
two
men
are
the
leaders
of
the
impressionist
school
their
friendship
has
been
jarred
by
inevitable
rivalry
degas
was
painting
when
i
was
painting
paris
says
manet
manet
is
in
despair
because
he
can
not
paint
atrocious
pictures
like
durant
and
be
fêted
and
decorated
he
is
an
artist
not
by
inclination
but
by
force
he
is
as
a
galley
slave
chained
to
the
oar
says
degas
different
too
are
their
methods
of
work
manet
paints
his
whole
picture
from
nature
trusting
his
instinct
to
lead
him
aright
through
the
devious
labyrinth
of
selection
nor
does
his
instinct
ever
fail
him
there
is
a
vision
in
his
eyes
which
he
calls
nature
and
which
he
paints
unconsciously
as
he
digests
his
food
thinking
and
declaring
vehemently
that
the
artist
should
not
seek
a
synthesis
but
should
paint
merely
what
he
sees
this
extraordinary
oneness
of
nature
and
artistic
vision
does
not
exist
in
degas
and
even
his
portraits
are
composed
from
drawings
and
notes
about
midnight
catulle
mendès
will
drop
in
when
he
has
corrected
his
proofs
he
will
come
with
his
fine
paradoxes
and
his
strained
eloquence
he
will
lean
towards
you
he
will
take
you
by
the
arm
and
his
presence
is
a
nervous
pleasure
and
when
the
is
closed
when
the
last
bock
has
been
drunk
we
shall
walk
about
the
great
moonlight
of
the
place
pigale
and
through
the
dark
shadows
of
the
streets
talking
of
the
last
book
published
he
hanging
on
to
my
arm
speaking
in
that
high
febrile
voice
of
his
every
phrase
luminous
aerial
even
as
the
soaring
moon
and
the
fitful
clouds
duranty
an
unknown
stendhal
will
come
in
for
an
hour
or
so
he
will
talk
little
and
go
away
quietly
he
knows
and
his
whole
manner
shows
that
he
knows
that
he
is
a
defeated
man
and
if
you
ask
him
why
he
does
not
write
another
novel
he
will
say
what
the
good
it
would
not
be
read
no
one
read
the
others
and
i
might
do
even
as
well
if

the

not
the

of
those
who
scorn

somewhere
in

of

there
shall

shall

miserably
and
they
shall
die
miserable
and
shall
be
forgotten
and
there
shall
never
arise
a
novelist
great
enough
to
make
live
in
art
that
eternal
spirit
of
devotion
disinterestedness
and
aspiration
which
in
each
generation
incarnates
itself
in
one
heroic
soul
better
wast
thou
than
those
who
stepped
to
opulence
and
fame
upon
thee
fallen
better
purer
thy
destiny
was
to
fall
that
others
might
rise
upon
thee
thou
wert
one
of
the
noble
legion
of
the
conquered
let
praise
be
given
to
the
conquered
for
with
them
lies
the
brunt
of
victory
child
of
the
pavement
of
strange
sonnets
and
stranger
music
i
remember
thee
i
remember
the
silk
shirts
the
four
sous
of
italian
cheese
the
roll
of
bread
and
the
glass
of
milk
the
streets
were
thy
and
the
walk
daily
to
the
suburban
music
hall
where
five
francs
were
earned
by
playing
the
accompaniments
of
comic
songs
and
the
wonderful
room
on
the
fifth
floor
which
was
furnished
when
that
celebrated
heritage
of
two
thousand
francs
was
paid
i
remember
the
fountain
that
was
bought
for
a
wardrobe
and
the
american
organ
with
all
the
instruments
of
the
orchestra
and
the
plaster
casts
under
which
the
homeless
ones
that
were
never
denied
a
refuge
and
a
crust
by
thee
slept
i
remember
all
and
the
buying
of
the
venus
de
milo
something
extraordinary
would
be
done
with
it
i
knew
but
the
result
exceeded
my
wildest
expectation
the
head
must
needs
be
struck
off
so
that
the
rapture
of
thy
admiration
should
be
secure
from
all
jarring
reminiscence
of
the
streets
then
the
wonderful
story
of
the
tenor
the
pork
butcher
who
was
heard
giving
out
such
a
volume
of
sound
that
the
sausages
were
set
in
motion
above
him
he
was
fed
clothed
and
educated
on
the
five
francs
a
day
earned
in
the
music
hall
in
the
avenue
de
la
motte
piquet
and
when
he
made
his
at
the
théâtre
lyrique
thou
wast
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
and
too
ill
to
go
to
hear
thy
pupil
success
he
was
immediately
engaged
by
mapleson
and
taken
to
america
i
remember
thy
face
cabaner
i
can
see
it
now
that
long
sallow
face
ending
in
a
brown
beard
and
the
hollow
eyes
the
meagre
arms
covered
with
a
silk
shirt
contrasting
strangely
with
the
rest
of
the
dress
in
all
thy
privation
and
poverty
thou
didst
never
forego
thy
silk
shirt
i
remember
the
paradoxes
and
the
aphorisms
if
not
the
exact
words
the
glamour
and
the
sentiment
of
a
humour
that
was
all
thy
own
never
didst
thou
laugh
no
not
even
when
in
discussing
how
silence
might
be
rendered
in
music
thou
didst
say
with
thy
extraordinary
pyrenean
accent
rendre
le
silence
en
musique
il
me
faudrait
trois
orchestres
militaires
and
when
i
did
show
thee
some
poor
verses
of
mine
french
verses
for
at
this
time
i
hated
and
had
partly
forgotten
my
native
language
my
dear
george
moore
you
always
write
about
love
the
subject
is
nauseating
so
it
is
so
it
is
but
after
all
baudelaire
wrote
about
love
and
lovers
his
best
poem
vrai
mais
il
charogne
et
cela
relève
beaucoup
la
i
remember
too
a
few
stray
snatches
of
thy
extraordinary
music
music
that
might
be
considered
by
wagner
as
a
little
too
advanced
but
which
liszt
would
not
fail
to
understand
also
thy
settings
of
sonnets
where
the
was
continued
uninterruptedly
from
the
first
line
to
the
last
and
that
still
more
marvellous
feat
thy
setting
likewise
with
unbroken
melody
of
villon
ballade
les
dames
du
temps
jadis
and
that
of
cabaner
the
putting
to
music
of
cros
hareng
saur
and
why
didst
thou
remain
ever
poor
and
unknown
because
of
something
too
much
or
something
too
little
because
of
something
too
much
so
i
think
at
least
thy
heart
was
too
full
of
too
pure
an
ideal
too
far
removed
from
all
possible
contagion
with
the
base
crowd
but
cabaner
thou
didst
not
labour
in
vain
thy
destiny
though
obscure
was
a
valiant
and
fruitful
one
and
as
in
life
thou
didst
live
for
others
so
now
in
death
thou
dost
live
in
others
thou
wast
in
an
hour
of
wonder
and
strange
splendour
when
the
last
tints
and
lovelinesses
of
romance
lingered
in
the
deepening
west
when
out
of
the
clear
east
rose
with
a
mighty
effulgence
of
colour
and
lawless
light
realism
when
showing
aloft
in
the
dead
pallor
of
the
zenith
like
a
white
flag
fluttering
faintly
symbolists
and
decadents
appeared
never
before
was
there
so
sudden
a
flux
and
conflux
of
artistic
desire
such
aspiration
in
the
soul
of
man
such
rage
of
passion
such
fainting
fever
such
cerebral
erethism
the
roar
and
dust
of
the
daily
battle
of
the
realists
was
continued
under
the
flush
of
the
sunset
the
arms
of
the
romantics
glittered
the
pale
spiritual
symbolists
watched
and
waited
none
knowing
yet
of
their
presence
in
such
an
hour
of
artistic
convulsion
and
renewal
of
thought
thou
wast
and
thou
wast
a
magnificent
rallying
point
for
all
comers
it
was
thou
who
didst
theorise
our
confused
aspirations
and
by
thy
holy
example
didst
save
us
from
all
base
commercialism
from
all
hateful
prostitution
thou
wast
ever
our
high
priest
and
from
thy
high
altar
turned
to
us
the
white
host
the
ideal
the
true
and
living
god
of
all
men
cabaner
i
see
you
now
entering
the
nouvelle
athènes
you
are
a
little
tired
after
your
long
weary
walk
but
you
lament
not
and
you
never
cry
out
against
the
public
that
will
accept
neither
your
music
nor
your
poetry
but
though
you
are
tired
and
footsore
you
are
ready
to
æstheticise
till
the
closes
for
you
the
homeless
ones
are
waiting
there
they
are
some
three
or
four
and
you
will
take
them
to
your
strange
room
furnished
with
the
american
organ
the
fountain
and
the
decapitated
venus
and
you
will
give
them
a
crust
each
and
cover
them
with
what
clothes
you
have
and
when
clothes
are
lacking
with
plaster
casts
and
though
you
will
take
but
a
glass
of
milk
yourself
you
will
find
a
few
sous
to
give
them
to
cool
their
thirsty
throats
so
you
have
ever
lived
a
blameless
life
is
yours
no
base
thought
has
ever
entered
there
not
even
a
woman
love
art
and
friends
that
is
all
reader
do
you
know
of
anything
more
angelic
if
you
do
you
are
more
fortunate
than
i
have
been
ix
the
synthesis
of
the
nouvelle
athenes
two
dominant
notes
in
my
character
an
original
hatred
of
my
native
country
and
a
brutal
loathing
of
the
religion
i
was
brought
up
in
all
the
aspects
of
my
native
country
are
violently
disagreeable
to
me
and
i
can
not
think
of
the
place
i
was
born
in
without
a
sensation
akin
to
nausea
these
feelings
are
inherent
and
inveterate
in
me
i
am
instinctively
averse
from
my
own
countrymen
they
are
at
once
remote
and
repulsive
but
with
frenchmen
i
am
conscious
of
a
sense
of
nearness
i
am
one
with
them
in
their
ideas
and
aspirations
and
when
i
am
with
them
i
am
alive
with
a
keen
and
penetrating
sense
of
intimacy
shall
i
explain
this
by
atavism
was
there
a
french
man
or
woman
in
my
family
some
generations
ago
i
have
not
inquired
the
english
i
love
and
with
a
love
that
is
foolish
mad
limitless
i
love
them
better
than
the
french
but
i
am
not
so
near
to
them
dear
sweet
protestant
england
the
red
tiles
of
the
farmhouse
the
elms
the
great
hedgerows
and
all
the
rich
fields
adorned
with
spreading
trees
and
the
weald
and
the
wold
the
very
words
are
passionately
beautiful
southern
england
not
the
north
there
is
something
celtic
in
the
north
southern
england
with
its
quiet
steadfast
faces
a
smock
frock
is
to
me
one
of
the
most
delightful
things
in
the
world
it
is
so
absolutely
english
the
villages
clustered
round
the
greens
the
spires
of
the
churches
pointing
between
the
elm
trees
this
is
congenial
to
me
and
this
is
protestantism
england
is
protestantism
protestantism
is
england
protestantism
is
strong
clean
and
westernly
catholicism
is
dirty
and
oriental
there
is
something
even
chinese
about
it
what
made
england
great
was
protestantism
and
when
she
ceases
to
be
protestant
she
will
fall
look
at
the
nations
that
have
clung
to
catholicism
starving
moonlighters
and
starving
brigands
the
protestant
flag
floats
on
every
ocean
breeze
the
catholic
banner
hangs
limp
in
the
incense
silence
of
the
vatican
let
us
be
protestant
and
revere
cromwell
un
i
write
to
please
myself
just
as
i
order
my
dinner
if
my
books
sell
i
can
not
help
it
it
is
an
accident
but
you
live
by
writing
yes
but
life
is
only
an
accident
art
is
eternal
what
i
reproach
zola
with
is
that
he
has
no
style
there
is
nothing
you
wo
find
in
zola
from
chateaubriand
to
the
reporting
in
the
he
seeks
immortality
in
an
exact
description
of
a
linendraper
shop
if
the
shop
conferred
immortality
it
should
be
upon
the
linendraper
who
created
the
shop
and
not
on
the
novelist
who
described
it
and
his
last
novel
how
spun
out
and
for
a
franc
a
line
in
the
gil
blas
not
a
single
new
or
even
exact
observation
and
that
terrible
phrase
repeated
over
and
over
again
la
conquête
de
paris
what
does
it
mean
i
never
knew
anyone
who
thought
of
conquering
paris
no
one
ever
spoke
of
conquering
paris
except
perhaps
two
or
three
provincials
you
must
have
rules
in
poetry
if
it
is
only
for
the
pleasure
of
breaking
them
just
as
you
must
have
women
dressed
if
it
is
only
for
the
pleasure
of
undressing
them
fancy
a
banquet
was
given
to
julien
by
his
pupils
he
made
a
speech
in
favour
of
lefebvre
and
hoped
that
every
one
there
would
vote
for
lefebvre
julien
was
very
eloquent
he
spoke
of
grand
art
le
and
lefebvre
unswerving
fidelity
to
elegance
refinement
an
echo
of
ancient
greece
and
then
what
do
you
think
when
he
had
exhausted
all
the
reasons
why
the
medal
of
honour
should
be
accorded
to
lefebvre
he
said
i
ask
you
to
remember
gentlemen
that
he
has
a
wife
and
eight
children
is
it
not
monstrous
but
it
is
you
who
are
monstrous
you
who
expect
to
fashion
the
whole
world
in
conformity
with
your
æstheticisms
a
vain
dream
and
if
realised
it
would
result
in
an
impossible
world
a
wife
and
children
are
the
basis
of
existence
and
it
is
folly
to
cry
out
because
an
appeal
to
such
interests
as
these
meet
with
response
it
will
be
so
till
the
end
of
time
and
these
great
interests
that
are
to
continue
to
the
end
of
time
began
two
years
ago
when
your
pictures
were
not
praised
in
the
as
much
as
you
thought
they
should
be
love
but
not
marriage
marriage
means
a
bed
and
papa
and
mamma
between
eleven
and
twelve
love
is
aspiration
transparencies
colour
light
a
sense
of
the
unreal
but
a
wife
you
know
all
about
her
who
her
father
was
who
her
mother
was
what
she
thinks
of
you
and
her
opinion
of
the
neighbours
over
the
way
where
then
is
the
dream
the
but
the
women
one
has
never
seen
before
that
one
will
never
see
again
the
choice
the
enervation
of
burning
odours
the
baptismal
whiteness
of
women
light
ideal
tissues
eyes
strangely
dark
with
kohl
names
that
evoke
palm
trees
and
ruins
spanish
moonlight
or
maybe
persepolis
the
of
an
eternal
yes
the
whisper
of
a
sweet
unending
yes
the
unknown
the
unreal
this
is
love
there
is
delusion
an
good
heavens
and
the
world
still
believes
in
education
in
teaching
people
the
grammar
of
art
education
should
be
confined
to
clerks
and
it
drives
even
them
to
drink
will
the
world
learn
that
we
never
learn
anything
that
we
did
not
know
before
the
artist
the
poet
painter
musician
and
novelist
go
straight
to
the
food
they
want
guided
by
an
unerring
and
ineffable
instinct
to
teach
them
is
to
destroy
the
nerve
of
the
artistic
instinct
art
flees
before
the
art
school
correct
drawing
solid
painting
is
it
impossible
to
teach
people
to
force
it
into
their
heads
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
correct
drawing
and
that
if
drawing
were
correct
it
would
be
wrong
solid
painting
good
heavens
do
they
suppose
that
there
is
one
sort
of
painting
that
is
better
than
all
others
and
that
there
is
a
receipt
for
making
it
as
for
making
chocolate
art
is
not
mathematics
it
is
individuality
it
does
not
matter
how
badly
you
paint
so
long
as
you
do
paint
badly
like
other
people
education
destroys
individuality
that
great
studio
of
julien
is
a
sphinx
and
all
the
poor
folk
that
go
there
for
artistic
education
are
devoured
after
two
years
they
all
paint
and
draw
alike
every
one
that
vile
execution
they
call
it
execution
pâte
la
peinture
au
premier
i
was
over
in
england
last
year
and
i
saw
some
portraits
by
a
man
called
richmond
they
were
horrible
but
i
liked
them
because
they
were
like
painting
stott
and
sargent
are
clever
fellows
enough
i
like
stott
the
best
if
they
had
remained
at
home
and
had
been
taught
they
might
have
developed
a
personal
art
but
the
trail
of
the
serpent
is
over
all
they
do
that
vile
french
painting
etc
stott
is
getting
over
it
by
degrees
he
exhibited
a
nymph
this
year
i
know
what
he
meant
it
was
an
interesting
intention
i
liked
his
little
landscapes
better
simplified
into
nothing
into
a
couple
of
primitive
tints
wonderful
clearness
light
but
i
doubt
if
he
will
find
a
public
to
understand
all
that
democratic
art
art
is
the
direct
antithesis
to
democracy
athens
a
few
thousand
citizens
who
owned
many
thousand
slaves
call
that
democracy
no
what
i
am
speaking
of
is
modern
democracy
the
mass
the
mass
can
only
appreciate
simple
and
emotions
puerile
prettiness
above
all
conventionalities
see
the
americans
that
come
over
here
what
do
they
admire
is
it
degas
or
manet
they
admire
no
bouguereau
and
lefebvre
what
was
most
admired
at
the
international
exhibition
the
dirty
boy
and
if
the
medal
of
honour
had
been
decided
by
a
the
dirty
boy
would
have
had
an
overwhelming
majority
what
is
the
literature
of
the
people
the
idiotic
stories
of
the
do
talk
of
shakespeare
molière
and
the
masters
they
are
accepted
on
the
authority
of
the
centuries
if
the
people
could
understand
the
people
would
not
read
the
if
the
people
could
understand
michel
angelo
they
would
not
look
at
our
bouguereau
or
your
bouguereau
sir
leighton
for
the
last
hundred
years
we
have
been
going
rapidly
towards
democracy
and
what
is
the
result
the
destruction
of
the
handicrafts
that
there
are
still
good
pictures
painted
and
good
poems
written
proves
nothing
there
will
always
be
found
men
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
a
picture
or
a
poem
but
the
decorative
arts
which
are
executed
in
collaboration
and
depend
for
support
on
the
general
taste
of
a
large
number
have
ceased
to
exist
explain
that
if
you
can
i
give
you
five
thousand
ten
thousand
francs
to
buy
a
beautiful
clock
that
is
not
a
copy
and
is
not
ancient
and
you
ca
do
it
such
a
thing
does
not
exist
look
here
i
was
going
up
the
staircase
of
the
louvre
the
other
day
they
were
putting
up
a
mosaic
it
was
horrible
every
one
knows
it
is
horrible
well
i
asked
who
had
given
the
order
for
this
mosaic
and
i
could
not
find
out
no
one
knew
an
order
is
passed
from
bureau
to
bureau
and
no
one
is
responsible
and
it
will
be
always
so
in
a
republic
and
the
more
republican
you
are
the
worse
it
will
be
the
world
is
dying
of
machinery
that
is
the
great
disease
that
is
the
plague
that
will
sweep
away
and
destroy
civilisation
man
will
have
to
rise
against
it
sooner
or
later
capital
unpaid
labour
and
all
the
rest
stuff
look
at
these
plates
they
were
painted
by
machinery
they
are
abominable
look
at
them
in
old
times
plates
were
painted
by
the
hand
and
the
supply
was
necessarily
limited
to
the
demand
and
a
china
in
which
there
was
always
something
more
or
less
pretty
was
turned
out
but
now
thousands
millions
of
plates
are
made
more
than
we
want
and
there
is
a
commercial
crisis
the
thing
is
inevitable
i
say
the
great
and
the
reasonable
revolution
will
be
when
mankind
rises
in
revolt
and
smashes
the
machinery
and
restores
the
handicrafts
goncourt
is
not
an
artist
notwithstanding
all
his
affectation
and
outcries
he
is
not
an
artist
me
fait
of
an
old
woman
shrieking
after
immortality
and
striving
to
beat
down
some
fragment
of
it
with
a
broom
once
it
was
a
duet
now
it
is
a
solo
they
wrote
novels
history
plays
they
collected
they
wrote
about
their
they
painted
in
they
etched
they
wrote
about
their
and
etchings
they
have
made
a
will
settling
that
the
is
to
be
sold
at
their
death
and
the
proceeds
applied
to
founding
a
prize
for
the
best
essay
or
novel
i
forget
which
it
is
they
wrote
about
the
prize
they
are
going
to
found
they
kept
a
diary
they
wrote
down
everything
they
heard
felt
or
saw
de
vieille
nothing
must
escape
not
the
slightest
word
it
might
be
that
very
word
that
might
confer
on
them
immortality
everything
they
heard
or
said
must
be
of
value
of
inestimable
value
a
real
artist
does
not
trouble
himself
about
immortality
about
everything
he
hears
feels
and
says
he
treats
ideas
and
sensations
as
so
much
clay
wherewith
to
create
and
then
the
famous
collaboration
how
it
was
talked
about
written
about
prayed
about
and
when
jules
died
what
a
subject
for
talk
for
articles
it
all
went
into
pot
hugo
vanity
was
titanic
goncourt
is
puerile
and
daudet
oh
daudet
de
la
whistler
of
all
artists
is
the
least
impressionist
the
idea
people
have
of
his
being
an
impressionist
only
proves
once
again
the
absolute
inability
of
the
public
to
understand
the
merits
or
the
demerits
of
artistic
work
whistler
art
is
classical
he
thinks
of
nature
but
he
does
not
see
nature
he
is
guided
by
his
mind
and
not
by
his
eyes
and
the
best
of
it
is
he
says
so
he
knows
it
well
enough
any
one
who
knows
him
must
have
heard
him
say
painting
is
absolutely
scientific
it
is
an
exact
science
and
his
work
is
in
accord
with
his
theory
he
risks
nothing
all
is
brought
down
arranged
balanced
and
made
one
his
pictures
are
thought
out
beforehand
they
are
mental
conceptions
i
admire
his
work
i
am
showing
how
he
is
misunderstood
even
by
those
who
think
they
understand
does
he
ever
seek
a
pose
that
is
characteristic
of
the
model
a
pose
that
the
model
repeats
oftener
than
any
other
never
he
advances
the
foot
puts
the
hand
on
the
hip
with
a
view
to
rendering
his
take
his
portrait
of
duret
did
he
ever
see
duret
in
dress
clothes
probably
not
did
he
ever
see
duret
with
a
lady
opera
cloak
i
am
sure
he
never
did
is
duret
in
the
habit
of
going
to
the
theatre
with
ladies
no
he
is
a
who
is
always
in
men
society
rarely
in
ladies
but
these
facts
mattered
nothing
to
whistler
as
they
matter
to
degas
or
to
manet
whistler
took
duret
out
of
his
environment
dressed
him
up
thought
out
a
scheme
in
a
word
painted
his
idea
without
concerning
himself
in
the
least
with
the
model
mark
you
i
deny
that
i
am
urging
any
fault
or
flaw
i
am
merely
contending
that
whistler
art
is
not
modern
art
but
classic
art
yes
and
severely
classical
far
more
classical
than
titian
or
velasquez
from
an
opposite
pole
as
classical
as
ingres
no
greek
dramatist
ever
sought
the
synthesis
of
things
more
uncompromisingly
than
whistler
and
he
is
right
art
is
not
nature
art
is
nature
digested
zola
and
goncourt
can
not
or
will
not
understand
that
the
artistic
stomach
must
be
allowed
to
do
its
work
in
its
own
mysterious
fashion
if
a
man
is
really
an
artist
he
will
remember
what
is
necessary
forget
what
is
useless
but
if
he
takes
notes
he
will
interrupt
his
artistic
digestion
and
the
result
will
be
a
lot
of
little
touches
inchoate
and
wanting
in
the
elegant
rhythm
of
the
synthesis
i
am
sick
of
synthetical
art
we
want
observation
direct
and
unreasoned
what
i
reproach
millet
with
is
that
it
is
always
the
same
thing
the
same
peasant
the
same
the
same
sentiment
you
must
admit
that
it
is
somewhat
stereotyped
what
does
that
matter
what
is
more
stereotyped
than
japanese
art
but
that
does
not
prevent
it
from
being
always
beautiful
people
talk
of
manet
originality
that
is
just
what
i
ca
see
what
he
has
got
and
what
you
ca
take
away
from
him
is
a
magnificent
execution
a
piece
of
still
life
by
manet
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
vividness
of
colour
breadth
simplicity
and
directness
of
touch
marvellous
french
translation
is
the
only
translation
in
england
you
still
continue
to
translate
poetry
into
poetry
instead
of
into
prose
we
used
to
do
the
same
but
we
have
long
ago
renounced
such
follies
either
of
two
things
if
the
translator
is
a
good
poet
he
substitutes
his
verse
for
that
of
the
original
i
do
want
his
verse
i
want
the
original
if
he
is
a
bad
poet
he
gives
us
bad
verse
which
is
intolerable
where
the
original
poet
put
an
effect
of
cæsura
the
translator
puts
an
effect
of
rhyme
where
the
original
poet
puts
an
effect
of
rhyme
the
translator
puts
an
effect
of
cæsura
take
longfellow
dante
does
it
give
as
good
an
idea
of
the
original
as
our
prose
translation
is
it
as
interesting
reading
take
bayard
taylor
translation
of
goethe
is
it
readable
not
to
any
one
with
an
ear
for
verse
will
any
one
say
that
taylor
would
be
read
if
the
original
did
not
exist
the
fragment
translated
by
shelley
is
beautiful
but
then
it
is
shelley
look
at
swinburne
translations
of
villon
they
are
beautiful
poems
by
swinburne
that
is
all
he
makes
villon
speak
of
a
splendid
kissing
mouth
villon
could
not
have
done
this
unless
he
had
read
swinburne
heine
translated
by
james
thomson
is
not
different
from
thomson
original
poems
heine
translated
by
sir
theodore
martin
is
doggerel
but
in
english
blank
verse
you
can
translate
quite
as
literally
as
you
could
into
prose
i
doubt
it
but
even
so
the
rhythm
of
the
blank
line
would
carry
your
mind
away
from
that
of
the
original
but
if
you
do
know
the
original
the
rhythm
of
the
original
can
be
suggested
in
prose
judiciously
used
even
if
it
is
your
mind
is
at
least
free
whereas
the
english
rhythm
must
destroy
the
sensation
of
something
foreign
there
is
no
translation
except
a
translation
baudelaire
translation
of
poe
and
hugo
translation
of
shakespeare
are
marvellous
in
this
respect
a
pun
or
joke
that
is
untranslatable
is
explained
in
a
note
but
that
is
the
way
young
ladies
translate
word
for
word
no
is
just
what
they
do
do
they
think
they
are
translating
word
for
word
but
they
are
all
the
proper
names
no
matter
how
unpronounceable
must
be
rigidly
adhered
to
you
must
never
transpose
versts
into
kilometres
or
roubles
into
francs
i
do
know
what
a
verst
is
or
what
a
rouble
is
but
when
i
see
the
words
i
am
in
russia
every
proverb
must
be
rendered
literally
even
if
it
does
make
very
good
sense
if
it
does
make
sense
at
all
it
must
be
explained
in
a
note
for
example
there
is
a
proverb
in
german
le
cheval
est
sellé
il
faut
le
in
french
there
is
a
proverb
le
vin
est
tiré
il
faut
le
well
a
translator
who
would
translate
le
by
le
is
an
ass
and
does
not
know
his
business
in
translation
only
a
strictly
classical
language
should
be
used
no
word
of
slang
or
even
word
of
modern
origin
should
be
employed
the
translator
aim
should
be
never
to
dissipate
the
illusion
of
an
exotic
if
i
were
translating
the
assommoir
into
english
i
should
strive
after
a
strong
flexible
but
colourless
language
something
what
shall
i
say
the
style
of
a
modern
addison
what
do
you
know
the
story
about
mendès
when
wanted
to
marry
his
sister
mother
it
appears
went
to
live
with
a
priest
the
poor
fellow
was
dreadfully
cut
up
he
was
and
he
went
to
mendès
his
heart
swollen
with
grief
determined
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
let
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
after
a
great
deal
of
beating
about
the
bush
and
apologising
he
got
it
out
you
know
mendès
you
can
see
him
smiling
a
little
and
looking
at
with
that
white
cameo
face
of
his
he
said
quel
meillur
homme
que
votre
mère
se
mit
vous
donc
jeune
homme
aucun
sentiment
victor
hugo
he
is
a
painter
on
porcelain
his
verse
is
mere
decoration
long
tendrils
and
flowers
and
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
how
to
be
happy
not
to
read
baudelaire
and
verlaine
not
to
enter
the
unless
perhaps
to
play
dominoes
like
the
over
there
not
to
do
anything
that
would
awake
a
too
intense
consciousness
of
life
to
live
in
a
sleepy
country
side
to
have
a
garden
to
work
in
to
have
a
wife
and
children
to
chatter
quietly
every
evening
over
the
details
of
existence
we
must
have
the
azaleas
out
and
thoroughly
cleansed
they
are
devoured
by
insects
the
tame
rook
has
flown
away
mother
lost
her
coming
from
church
she
thinks
it
was
stolen
a
good
honest
peasant
who
knows
nothing
of
politics
must
be
very
nearly
happy
and
to
think
there
are
people
who
would
educate
who
would
draw
these
people
out
of
the
calm
satisfaction
of
their
instincts
and
give
them
passions
the

is
the
nero
of
modern
times
x
extract
from
a
letter
why
did
you
not
send
a
letter
we
have
all
been
writing
to
you
for
the
last
six
months
but
no
answer
none
had
you
written
one
word
i
would
have
saved
all
the
poor
was
in
despair
she
said
the
would
wait
if
you
had
only
said
when
you
were
coming
back
or
if
you
only
had
let
us
know
what
you
wished
to
be
done
three
quarters
rent
was
due
and
no
news
could
be
obtained
of
you
so
an
auction
had
to
be
called
it
nearly
broke
my
heart
to
see
those
horrid
men
tramping
over
the
delicate
carpets
their
coarse
faces
set
against
the
sweet
colour
of
that
beautiful
english
cretonne
and
all
the
while
the
pastel
by
manet
the
great
hat
set
like
an
aureole
about
the
face
eyes
deep
set
in
crimson
shadow
fan
widespread
across
the
bosom
you
see
i
am
quoting
your
own
words
looking
down
the
mistress
of
that
little
paradise
of
tapestry
she
seemed
to
resent
the
intrusion
i
looked
once
or
twice
half
expecting
those
eyes
set
in
crimson
shadow
to
fill
with
tears
but
nothing
altered
her
great
dignity
she
seemed
to
see
all
but
as
a
buddha
she
remained
impenetrable
i
was
there
the
night
before
the
sale
i
looked
through
the
books
taking
notes
of
those
i
intended
to
buy
those
which
we
used
to
read
together
when
the
snow
lay
high
about
the
legs
of
the
poor
faun
in
that
laughed
amid
the
frosty
i
found
a
large
packet
of
letters
which
i
instantly
destroyed
you
should
not
be
so
careless
i
wonder
how
it
is
that
men
are
always
careless
about
their
letters
the
sale
was
announced
for
one
i
wore
a
thick
veil
for
i
did
not
wish
to
be
recognised
the
of
course
knew
me
but
she
can
be
depended
upon
the
poor
old
woman
was
in
tears
so
sorry
was
she
to
see
all
your
pretty
things
sold
up
you
left
owing
her
a
hundred
francs
but
i
have
paid
her
and
talking
of
you
we
waited
till
the
auctioneer
arrived
everything
had
been
pulled
down
the
tapestry
from
the
walls
the
picture
the
two
vases
i
gave
you
were
on
the
table
waiting
the
stroke
of
the
hammer
and
then
the
men
all
the
de
in
the
came
upstairs
spitting
and
talking
coarsely
their
foul
voices
went
through
me
they
stamped
spat
pulled
the
things
about
nothing
escaped
them
one
of
them
held
up
the
japanese
and
made
some
horrible
jokes
and
the
auctioneer
who
was
a
humorist
answered
there
are
any
ladies
men
present
we
shall
have
some
spirited
bidding
the
pastel
i
bought
and
i
shall
keep
it
and
try
to
find
some
excuse
to
satisfy
my
husband
but
i
send
you
the
miniature
and
i
hope
you
will
not
let
it
be
sold
again
there
were
many
other
things
i
should
have
liked
to
buy
but
i
did
not
dare
the
organ
that
you
used
to
play
hymns
on
and
i
waltzes
on
the
turkish
lamp
which
we
could
never
agree
about
but
when
i
saw
the
satin
shoes
which
i
gave
you
to
carry
the
night
of
that
adorable
ball
and
which
you
would
not
give
back
but
nailed
up
on
the
wall
on
either
side
of
your
bed
and
put
matches
in
i
was
seized
with
an
almost
invincible
desire
to
steal
them
i
do
know
why
caprice
de
no
one
but
you
would
have
ever
thought
of
converting
satin
shoes
into
match
boxes
i
wore
them
at
that
delicious
ball
we
danced
all
night
together
and
you
had
an
explanation
with
my
husband
i
was
a
little
afraid
for
a
moment
but
it
came
out
all
right
and
we
went
and
sat
on
the
balcony
in
the
soft
warm
moonlight
we
watched
the
glitter
of
epaulets
and
gas
the
satin
of
the
bodices
the
whiteness
of
passing
shoulders
we
dreamed
the
massy
darknesses
of
the
park
the
fairy
light
along
the
lawny
spaces
the
heavy
perfume
of
the
flowers
the
pink
of
the
camellias
and
you
quoted
something
camélias
du
balcon
ressemblent
à
des
désirs
it
was
horrid
of
you
but
you
always
had
a
knack
of
rubbing
one
up
the
wrong
way
then
do
you
not
remember
how
we
danced
in
one
room
while
the
servants
set
the
other
out
with
little
tables
that
supper
was
fascinating
i
suppose
it
was
these
pleasant
remembrances
which
made
me
wish
for
the
shoes
but
i
could
not
summon
up
courage
enough
to
buy
them
and
the
horrid
people
were
comparing
me
with
the
pastel
i
suppose
i
did
look
a
little
mysterious
with
a
double
veil
bound
across
my
face
the
shoes
went
with
a
lot
of
other
things
and
oh
to
whom
so
now
that
pretty
little
retreat
in
the
de
la
tour
des
is
ended
for
ever
for
you
and
me
we
shall
not
see
the
faun
in
again
i
was
thinking
of
going
to
see
him
the
other
day
but
the
street
is
so
steep
my
coachman
advised
me
to
spare
the
horse
hind
legs
i
believe
it
is
the
steepest
street
in
paris
and
your
luncheon
parties
how
i
did
enjoy
them
and
how
fay
did
enjoy
them
too
and
what
i
risked
as
i
am
picking
my
way
from
the
tramcar
down
to
that
little
street
men
never
appreciate
the
risks
women
run
for
them
but
to
leave
my
letters
lying
about
i
can
not
forgive
that
when
i
told
fay
she
said
can
you
expect
i
warned
you
against
flirting
with
boys
i
never
did
before
never
paris
is
now
just
as
it
was
when
you
used
to
sit
on
the
balcony
and
i
read
you
browning
you
never
liked
his
poetry
and
i
can
not
understand
why
i
have
found
a
new
poem
which
i
am
sure
would
convert
you
you
should
be
here
there
are
lilacs
in
the
room
and
the
is
beautiful
upon
a
great
lemon
sky
and
the
long
avenue
is
merging
into
violet
vapour
we
have
already
begun
to
think
of
where
we
shall
go
to
this
year
last
year
we
went
to
p
an
enchanting
place
quite
rustic
but
within
easy
distance
of
a
casino
i
had
vowed
not
to
dance
for
i
had
been
out
every
night
during
the
season
but
the
temptation
proved
irresistible
and
i
gave
way
there
were
two
young
men
here
one
the
count
of
b
the
other
the
marquis
of
g
one
of
the
best
families
in
france
a
distant
cousin
of
my
husband
he
has
written
a
book
which
every
one
says
is
one
of
the
most
amusing
things
that
has
appeared
for
years
surtout
très
he
paid
me
great
attentions
and
made
my
husband
wildly
jealous
i
used
to
go
out
and
sit
with
him
amid
the
rocks
and
it
was
perhaps
very
lucky
for
me
that
he
went
away
we
may
return
there
this
year
if
so
i
wish
you
would
come
and
spend
a
month
there
is
an
excellent
hotel
where
you
would
be
very
comfortable
we
have
decided
nothing
as
yet
the
duchesse
de
is
giving
a
costume
ball
they
say
it
is
going
to
be
a
most
wonderful
affair
i
do
know
what
money
is
not
going
to
be
spent
upon
the
cotillion
i
have
just
got
home
a
fascinating
toilette
i
am
going
as
a
you
know
a
short
skirt
and
a
little
cap
the
marquise
gave
a
ball
some
few
days
ago
i
danced
the
cotillion
with
l
who
as
you
know
dances
divinely
fait
la
but
it
is
of
course
no
use
you
know
that
the
other
night
we
went
to
see
the
a
fascinating
play
and
i
am
reading
the
book
i
do
know
which
i
like
the
best
i
think
the
play
but
the
book
is
very
good
too
now
that
is
what
i
call
a
novel
and
i
am
a
judge
for
i
have
read
all
novels
but
i
must
not
talk
literature
or
you
will
say
something
stupid
i
wish
you
would
not
make
foolish
remarks
about
men
that
considers
the
cleverest
it
does
not
matter
so
much
with
me
i
know
you
but
then
people
laugh
at
you
behind
your
back
and
that
is
not
nice
for
me
the
was
here
the
other
day
and
she
said
she
almost
wished
you
would
not
come
on
her
so
extraordinary
were
the
remarks
you
made
and
by
the
way
the
has
written
a
book
i
have
not
seen
it
but
i
hear
that
it
is
really
too
she
is
femme
but
the
way
she
affiché
herself
is
too
much
for
any
one
she
never
goes
anywhere
now
without
d
it
is
a
great
pity
and
now
my
dear
friend
write
me
a
nice
letter
and
tell
me
when
you
are
coming
back
to
paris
i
am
sure
you
can
not
amuse
yourself
in
that
hateful
london
the
nicest
thing
about
you
was
that
you
were
really
come
back
and
take
a
nice
apartment
on
the
champs
elysées
you
might
come
back
for
the
duchesse
ball
i
will
get
an
invitation
for
you
and
will
keep
the
cotillion
for
you
the
idea
of
running
away
as
you
did
and
never
telling
any
one
where
you
were
going
to
i
always
said
you
were
a
little
cracked
and
letting
all
your
things
be
sold
if
you
had
only
told
me
i
should
like
so
much
to
have
had
that
turkish
lamp
yours
how
like
her
that
letter
is
egotistical
vain
foolish
no
not
foolish
narrow
limited
but
not
foolish
worldly
oh
how
worldly
and
yet
not
repulsively
so
for
there
always
was
in
her
a
certain
intensity
of
feeling
that
saved
her
from
the
commonplace
and
gave
her
an
inexpressible
charm
yes
she
is
a
woman
who
can
feel
and
she
has
lived
her
life
and
felt
it
very
acutely
very
sincerely
sincerely
like
a
moth
caught
in
a
gauze
curtain
well
would
that
preclude
sincerity
sincerity
seems
to
convey
an
idea
of
depth
and
she
was
not
very
deep
that
is
quite
certain
i
never
could
understand
her
a
little
brain
that
span
rapidly
and
hummed
a
pretty
humming
tune
but
no
there
was
something
more
in
her
than
that
she
often
said
things
that
i
thought
clever
things
that
i
did
not
forget
things
that
i
should
like
to
put
into
books
but
it
was
not
brain
power
it
was
only
intensity
of
feeling
nervous
feeling
i
do
know
perhaps
she
has
lived
her
life
yes
within
certain
limits
she
has
lived
her
life
none
of
us
do
more
than
that
true
i
remember
the
first
time
i
saw
her
sharp
little
and
merry
a
changeable
little
sprite
i
thought
she
had
ugly
hands
so
she
has
and
yet
i
forgot
all
about
her
hands
before
i
had
known
her
a
month
it
is
now
seven
years
ago
how
time
passes
i
was
very
young
then
what
battles
we
have
had
what
quarrels
still
we
had
good
times
together
she
never
lost
sight
of
me
but
no
intrusion
far
too
clever
for
that
i
never
got
the
better
of
her
but
once
once
i
did
she
soon
made
up
for
lost
ground
i
wonder
what
the
charm
was
i
did
not
think
her
pretty
i
did
not
think
her
clever
that
i
know
i
never
knew
if
she
cared
for
me
never
there
were
moments
when
curious
febrile
subtle
little
creature
oh
infinitely
subtle
subtle
in
everything
in
her
sensations
subtle
i
suppose
that
was
her
charm
subtleness
i
never
knew
if
she
cared
for
me
i
never
knew
if
she
hated
her
husband
one
never
knew
her
i
never
knew
how
she
would
receive
me
the
last
time
i
saw
her
that
stupid
american
would
take
her
downstairs
no
getting
rid
of
him
and
i
was
hiding
behind
one
of
the
pillars
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
my
hand
on
the
cab
door
however
she
could
not
blame
me
that
time
and
all
the
stories
she
used
to
invent
of
my
indiscretions
i
believe
she
used
to
get
them
up
for
the
sake
of
the
excitement
she
was
awfully
silly
in
some
ways
once
you
got
her
into
a
certain
line
that
marriage
that
title
and
she
used
to
think
of
it
night
and
day
i
shall
never
forget
when
she
went
into
mourning
for
the
count
de
chambord
and
her
tastes
oh
how
bourgeois
they
were
that
salon
the
flagrantly
modern
clock
brass
work
eight
hundred
francs
on
the
boulevard
st
germain
the
cabinets
brass
work
the
rich
brown
carpet
and
the
furniture
set
all
round
the
room
geometrically
the
great
gilt
mirror
the
ancestral
portrait
the
arms
and
crest
everywhere
and
the
stuffy
bourgeois
sense
of
comfort
a
little
grotesque
no
doubt
the
mechanical
admiration
for
all
that
is
about
her
for
the
general
atmosphere
the
that
is
to
say
albert
wolf
le
plus
spirituel
de
paris
dans
le
the
success
of
georges
ohnet
and
the
talent
of
gustave
doré
but
with
all
this
vulgarity
of
taste
certain
appreciations
certain
ebullitions
of
sentiment
within
the
radius
of
sentiment
certain
elevations
and
depravities
depravities
in
the
legitimate
sense
of
the
word
that
is
to
say
a
revolt
against
the
commonplace
ha
ha
ha
how
i
have
been
dreaming
i
wish
i
had
not
been
awoke
from
my
reverie
it
was
pleasant
the
letter
just
read
indicates
if
it
does
not
clearly
tell
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
my
life
and
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
that
one
morning
a
few
months
ago
when
my
servant
brought
me
some
summer
honey
and
a
glass
of
milk
to
my
bedside
she
handed
me
an
unpleasant
letter
my
agent
handwriting
even
when
i
knew
the
envelope
contained
a
cheque
has
never
quite
failed
to
produce
a
sensation
of
repugnance
in
me
so
hateful
is
any
sort
of
account
that
i
avoid
as
much
as
possible
even
knowing
how
i
stand
at
my
banker
therefore
the
odour
of
honey
and
milk
so
evocative
of
fresh
flowers
and
fields
was
spoilt
that
morning
for
me
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
slipped
on
that
beautiful
japanese
which
i
shall
never
see
again
and
read
the
odious
epistle
that
some
wretched
farmers
and
miners
should
refuse
to
starve
that
i
may
not
be
deprived
of
my
at
that
i
may
not
be
forced
to
leave
this
beautiful
retreat
my
cat
and
my
python
monstrous
and
these
wretched
creatures
will
find
moral
support
in
england
they
will
find
pity
pity
that
most
vile
of
all
vile
virtues
has
never
been
known
to
me
the
great
pagan
world
i
love
knew
it
not
now
the
world
proposes
to
interrupt
the
terrible
austere
laws
of
nature
which
ordain
that
the
weak
shall
be
trampled
upon
shall
be
ground
into
death
and
dust
that
the
strong
shall
be
really
strong
that
the
strong
shall
be
glorious
sublime
a
little
bourgeois
comfort
a
little
bourgeois
sense
of
right
cry
the
moderns
hither
the
world
has
been
drifting
since
the
coming
of
the
pale
socialist
of
galilee
and
this
is
why
i
hate
him
and
deny
his
divinity
his
divinity
is
falling
it
is
evanescent
in
sight
of
the
goal
he
dreamed
again
he
is
denied
by
his
disciples
poor
fallen
god
i
who
hold
nought
else
pitiful
pity
thee
thy
bleeding
face
and
hands
and
feet
thy
hanging
body
thou
at
least
art
picturesque
and
in
a
way
beautiful
in
the
midst
of
the
sombre
mediocrity
towards
which
thou
has
drifted
for
two
thousand
years
a
flag
and
in
which
thou
shalt
find
thy
doom
as
i
mine
i
who
will
not
adore
thee
and
can
not
curse
thee
now
for
verily
thy
life
and
thy
fate
has
been
greater
stranger
and
more
divine
than
any
man
has
been
the
chosen
people
the
garden
the
betrayal
the
crucifixion
and
the
beautiful
story
not
of
mary
but
of
magdalen
the
god
descending
to
the
harlot
even
the
great
pagan
world
of
marble
and
pomp
and
lust
and
cruelty
that
my
soul
goes
out
to
and
hails
as
the
grandest
has
not
so
sublime
a
contrast
to
show
us
as
this
come
to
me
ye
who
are
weak
the
word
went
forth
the
terrible
disastrous
word
and
before
it
fell
the
ancient
gods
and
the
vices
that
they
represent
and
which
i
revere
are
outcast
now
in
the
world
of
men
the
word
went
forth
and
the
world
interpreted
the
word
blindly
ignorantly
savagely
for
two
thousand
years
but
nevertheless
nearing
every
day
the
end
the
end
that
thou
in
thy
divine
intelligence
foresaw
that
finds
its
voice
enormous
though
the
antithesis
may
be
i
will
say
it
in
the
mall
what
fate
has
been
like
thine
betrayed
by
judas
in
the
garden
denied
by
peter
before
the
cock
crew
crucified
between
thieves
and
mourned
for
by
a
harlot
and
then
sent
bound
and
bare
nothing
changed
nothing
altered
in
thy
ignominious
plight
forthward
in
the
world
van
the
glory
and
symbol
of
a
man
new
idea
pity
thy
day
is
closing
in
but
the
heavens
are
now
wider
aflame
with
thy
light
than
ever
before
thy
light
which
i
a
pagan
standing
on
the
last
verge
of
the
old
world
declare
to
be
darkness
the
coming
night
of
pity
and
justice
which
is
imminent
which
is
the
twentieth
century
the
bearers
have
relinquished
thy
cross
they
leave
thee
in
the
hour
of
thy
universal
triumph
thy
crown
of
thorns
is
falling
thy
face
is
buffeted
with
blows
and
not
even
a
reed
is
placed
in
thy
hand
for
sceptre
only
i
and
mine
are
by
thee
we
who
shall
perish
with
thee
in
the
ruin
thou
hast
created
injustice
we
worship
all
that
lifts
us
out
of
the
miseries
of
life
is
the
sublime
fruit
of
injustice
every
immortal
deed
was
an
act
of
fearful
injustice
the
world
of
grandeur
of
triumph
of
courage
of
lofty
aspiration
was
built
up
on
injustice
man
would
not
be
man
but
for
injustice
hail
therefore
to
the
thrice
glorious
virtue
injustice
what
care
i
that
some
millions
of
wretched
israelites
died
under
pharaoh
lash
or
egypt
sun
it
was
well
that
they
died
that
i
might
have
the
pyramids
to
look
on
or
to
fill
a
musing
hour
with
wonderment
is
there
one
amongst
us
who
would
exchange
them
for
the
lives
of
the
ignominious
slaves
that
died
what
care
i
that
the
virtue
of
some
maiden
was
the
price
paid
for
ingres
that
the
model
died
of
drink
and
disease
in
the
hospital
is
nothing
when
compared
with
the
essential
that
i
should
have
that
exquisite
dream
of
innocence
to
think
of
till
my
soul
is
sick
with
delight
of
the
painter
holy
vision
nay
more
the
knowledge
that
a
wrong
was
done
that
millions
of
israelites
died
in
torments
that
a
girl
or
a
thousand
girls
died
in
the
hospital
for
that
one
virginal
thing
is
an
added
pleasure
which
i
could
not
afford
to
spare
oh
for
the
silence
of
marble
courts
for
the
shadow
of
great
pillars
for
gold
for
reticulated
canopies
of
lilies
to
see
the
great
gladiators
pass
to
hear
them
cry
the
famous
ave
caesar
to
hold
the
thumb
down
to
see
the
blood
flow
to
fill
the
languid
hours
with
the
agonies
of
poisoned
slaves
oh
for
excess
for
crime
i
would
give
many
lives
to
save
one
sonnet
by
baudelaire
for
the
hymn
la
à
la
qui
remplit
man
cœur
de
clarté
let
the
in
every
house
in
europe
be
slain
and
in
all
sincerity
i
profess
my
readiness
to
decapitate
all
the
japanese
in
japan
and
elsewhere
to
save
from
destruction
one
drawing
by
hokusai
again
i
say
that
all
we
deem
sublime
in
the
world
history
are
acts
of
injustice
and
it
is
certain
that
if
mankind
does
not
relinquish
at
once
and
for
ever
its
vain
mad
and
fatal
dream
of
justice
the
world
will
lapse
into
barbarism
england
was
great
and
glorious
because
england
was
unjust
and
england
greatest
son
was
the
personification
of
injustice
cromwell
but
the
old
world
of
heroes
is
over
now
the
skies
above
us
are
dark
with
sentimentalism
the
sand
beneath
us
is
shoaling
fast
we
are
running
with
streaming
canvas
upon
ruin
all
ideals
have
gone
nothing
remains
to
us
for
worship
but
the
mass
the
blind
inchoate
insatiate
mass
fog
and
fen
land
before
us
we
shall
founder
in
putrefying
mud
creatures
of
the
ooze
and
rushes
about
us
we
the
great
ship
that
has
floated
up
from
the
antique
world
oh
for
the
antique
world
its
plain
passion
its
plain
joys
in
the
sea
where
the
triton
blew
a
plaintive
blast
and
the
forest
where
the
whiteness
of
the
nymph
was
seen
escaping
we
are
weary
of
pity
we
are
weary
of
being
good
we
are
weary
of
tears
and
effusion
and
our
refuge
the
british
museum
is
the
wide
sea
shore
and
the
wind
of
the
ocean
there
there
is
real
joy
in
the
flesh
our
statues
are
naked
but
we
are
ashamed
and
our
nakedness
is
indecency
a
fair
frank
soul
is
mirrored
in
those
fauns
and
nymphs
and
how
strangely
enigmatic
is
the
soul
of
the
antique
world
the
bare
barbarous
soul
of
beauty
and
of
might
xi
but
neither
apollo
nor
buddha
could
help
or
save
me
one
in
his
exquisite
balance
of
body
a
song
of
eternal
beauty
stood
lightly
advancing
the
other
sat
in
sombre
contemplation
calm
as
a
beautiful
evening
i
looked
for
sorrow
in
the
eyes
of
the
pastel
the
beautiful
pastel
that
seemed
to
fill
with
a
real
presence
the
rich
autumnal
leaves
where
the
jays
darted
and
screamed
the
twisted
columns
of
the
bed
rose
burdened
with
great
weight
of
fringes
and
curtains
the
python
devoured
a
the
last
i
gave
him
the
great
white
cat
came
to
me
i
said
all
this
must
go
must
henceforth
be
to
me
an
abandoned
dream
a
something
not
more
real
than
a
summer
meditation
so
be
it
and
as
was
characteristic
of
me
i
broke
with
paris
suddenly
without
warning
anyone
i
knew
in
my
heart
of
hearts
that
i
should
never
return
but
no
word
was
spoken
and
i
continued
a
pleasant
delusion
with
myself
i
told
my
that
i
would
return
in
a
month
and
i
left
all
to
be
sold
brutally
sold
by
auction
as
the
letter
i
read
in
the
last
chapter
charmingly
and
touchingly
describes
not
even
to
marshall
did
i
confide
my
foreboding
that
paris
would
pass
out
of
my
life
that
it
would
henceforth
be
with
me
a
beautiful
memory
but
never
more
a
practical
delight
he
and
i
were
no
longer
living
together
we
had
parted
a
second
time
but
this
time
without
bitterness
of
any
kind
he
had
learnt
to
feel
that
i
wanted
to
live
alone
and
had
moved
away
into
the
latin
quarter
whither
i
made
occasional
expeditions
i
accompanied
him
once
to
the
old
haunts
but
various
terms
of
penal
servitude
had
scattered
our
friends
and
i
could
not
interest
myself
in
the
new
nor
did
marshall
himself
interest
me
as
he
had
once
done
to
my
eager
taste
he
had
grown
just
a
little
trite
my
affection
for
him
was
as
deep
and
sincere
as
ever
were
i
to
meet
him
now
i
would
grasp
his
hand
and
hail
him
with
firm
loyal
friendship
but
i
had
made
friends
in
the
nouvelle
athènes
who
interested
me
passionately
and
my
thoughts
were
absorbed
by
and
set
on
new
ideals
which
marshall
had
failed
to
find
sympathy
for
or
even
to
understand
i
had
introduced
him
to
degas
and
manet
but
he
had
spoken
of
jules
lefèbvre
and
bouguereau
and
generally
shown
himself
incapable
of
any
higher
education
he
could
not
enter
where
i
had
entered
and
this
was
alienation
we
could
no
longer
even
talk
of
the
same
people
when
i
spoke
of
a
certain
he
answered
with
an
indifferent
do
you
really
think
so
and
proceeded
to
drag
me
away
from
my
glitter
of
satin
to
the
dinginess
of
print
dresses
it
was
more
than
alienation
it
was
almost
separation
but
he
was
still
my
friend
he
was
the
man
and
he
always
will
be
to
whom
my
youth
with
all
its
aspirations
was
most
closely
united
so
i
turned
to
say
to
him
and
to
my
past
life
rap
rap
rap
who
there
i
george
moore
i
got
a
model
never
mind
your
model
open
the
door
how
are
you
what
are
you
painting
this
what
do
you
think
of
it
it
is
prettily
composed
i
think
it
will
come
out
all
right
i
am
going
to
england
come
to
say
going
to
england
what
will
you
do
in
england
i
have
to
go
about
money
matters
very
tiresome
i
had
really
begun
to
forget
there
was
such
a
place
but
you
are
not
going
to
stay
there
oh
no
you
will
be
just
in
time
to
see
the
academy
the
conversation
turned
on
art
and
we
æstheticised
for
an
hour
at
last
marshall
said
i
am
really
sorry
old
chap
but
i
must
send
you
away
there
that
model
the
girl
sat
waiting
her
pale
hair
hanging
down
her
back
a
very
picture
of
discontent
send
her
away
i
asked
her
to
come
out
to
dinner
d
n
her
well
never
mind
i
must
spend
this
last
evening
with
you
you
shall
both
dine
with
me
quitte
paris
demain
matin
pour
longtemps
je
voudrais
passer
ma
dernière
soirèe
avec
mon
ami
alors
si
vous
voulez
bien
me
permettre
mademoiselle
je
vous
invite
tous
les
deux
à
diner
nous
passerons
la
soirèe
ensemble
si
cela
vous
est
veux
bien
poor
marie
marshall
and
i
were
absorbed
in
each
other
and
art
it
was
always
so
we
dined
in
a
and
afterwards
we
went
to
a
students
ball
and
it
seems
like
yesterday
i
can
see
the
moon
sailing
through
a
clear
sky
and
on
the
pavement
edge
marshall
beautiful
slim
manly
figure
and
marie
exquisite
gracefulness
she
was
lefèbvre
chloe
so
every
one
sees
her
now
her
end
was
a
tragic
one
she
invited
her
friends
to
dinner
and
with
the
few
pence
that
remained
she
bought
some
boxes
of
matches
boiled
them
and
drank
the
water
no
one
knew
why
some
said
it
was
love
i
went
to
london
in
an
exuberant
necktie
a
tiny
hat
i
wore
large
trousers
and
a
capoul
beard
looking
i
believe
as
unlike
an
englishman
as
a
drawing
by
grévin
in
the
of
morley
hotel
i
met
my
agent
an
immense
nose
and
a
wisp
of
hair
drawn
over
a
bald
skull
he
explained
after
some
hesitation
that
i
owed
him
a
few
thousands
and
that
the
accounts
were
in
his
portmanteau
i
suggested
taking
them
to
a
solicitor
to
have
them
examined
the
solicitor
advised
me
strongly
to
contest
them
i
did
not
take
the
advice
but
raised
some
money
instead
and
so
the
matter
ended
so
far
as
the
immediate
future
was
concerned
the
years
that
are
most
impressionable
from
twenty
to
thirty
when
the
senses
and
the
mind
are
the
widest
awake
i
the
most
impressionable
of
human
beings
had
spent
in
france
not
among
english
residents
but
among
that
which
is
the
quintessence
of
the
nation
not
an
indifferent
spectator
but
an
enthusiast
striving
heart
and
soul
to
identify
himself
with
his
environment
to
shake
himself
free
from
race
and
language
and
to
recreate
himself
as
it
were
in
the
womb
of
a
new
nationality
assuming
its
ideals
its
morals
and
its
modes
of
thought
and
i
had
succeeded
strangely
well
and
when
i
returned
home
england
was
a
new
country
to
me
i
had
as
it
were
forgotten
everything
every
aspect
of
street
and
suburban
garden
was
new
to
me
of
the
manner
of
life
of
londoners
i
knew
nothing
this
sounds
incredible
but
it
is
so
i
saw
but
i
could
realise
nothing
i
went
into
a
but
everything
seemed
far
away
a
dream
a
presentment
nothing
more
i
was
in
touch
with
nothing
of
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
those
i
met
i
could
understand
nothing
nor
could
i
sympathise
with
them
an
englishman
was
at
that
time
as
much
out
of
my
mental
reach
as
an
esquimaux
would
be
now
women
were
nearer
to
me
than
men
and
i
will
take
this
opportunity
to
note
my
observation
for
i
am
not
aware
that
any
one
else
has
observed
that
the
difference
between
the
two
races
is
found
in
the
men
not
in
the
women
french
and
english
women
are
psychologically
very
similar
the
standpoint
from
which
they
see
life
is
the
same
the
same
thoughts
interest
and
amuse
them
but
the
attitude
of
a
frenchman
mind
is
absolutely
opposed
to
that
of
an
englishman
they
stand
on
either
side
of
a
vast
abyss
two
animals
different
in
colour
form
and
temperament
two
ideas
destined
to
remain
irrevocably
separate
and
distinct
i
have
heard
of
writing
and
speaking
two
languages
equally
well
this
was
impossible
to
me
and
i
am
convinced
that
if
i
had
remained
two
more
years
in
france
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
identify
my
thoughts
with
the
language
i
am
now
writing
in
and
i
should
have
written
it
as
an
alien
as
it
was
i
only
just
escaped
this
detestable
fate
and
it
was
in
the
last
two
years
when
i
began
to
write
french
verse
and
occasional
in
the
papers
that
the
great
damage
was
done
i
remember
very
well
indeed
one
day
while
arranging
an
act
of
a
play
i
was
writing
with
a
friend
finding
suddenly
to
my
surprise
that
i
could
think
more
easily
and
rapidly
in
french
that
in
english
but
with
all
this
i
did
not
learn
french
i
chattered
and
i
felt
intensely
at
home
in
it
yes
i
could
write
a
sonnet
or
a
ballade
almost
without
a
slip
but
my
prose
required
a
good
deal
of
alteration
for
a
greater
command
of
language
is
required
to
write
in
prose
than
in
verse
i
found
this
in
french
and
also
in
english
when
i
returned
from
paris
my
english
terribly
corrupt
with
french
ideas
and
forms
of
thought
i
could
write
acceptable
english
verse
but
even
ordinary
newspaper
prose
was
beyond
my
reach
and
an
attempt
i
made
to
write
a
novel
drifted
into
a
miserable
failure
here
is
a
poem
that
cabaner
admired
he
liked
it
in
the
french
prose
translation
which
i
made
for
him
one
night
in
the
nouvelle
athènes
we
are
alone
listen
a
little
while
and
hear
the
reason
why
your
weary
smile
and
speaking
is
so
very
sweet
and
how
my
love
of
you
is
more
complete
than
any
love
of
any
lover
they
have
only
been
attracted
by
the
gray
delicious
softness
of
your
eyes
your
slim
and
delicate
form
or
some
such
other
whim
the
simple
pretexts
of
all
lovers
i
for
other
reason
listen
whilst
i
try
to
say
i
joy
to
see
the
sunset
slope
beyond
the
weak
hours
hopeless
horoscope
leaving
the
heavens
a
melancholy
calm
of
quiet
colour
chaunted
like
a
psalm
in
mildly
modulated
phrases
thus
your
life
shall
fade
like
a
voluptuous
vision
beyond
the
sight
and
you
shall
die
like
some
soft
evening
sad
serenity
i
would
possess
your
dying
hours
indeed
my
love
is
worthy
of
the
gift
i
plead
for
them
although
i
never
loved
as
yet
methinks
that
i
might
love
you
i
would
get
from
out
the
knowledge
that
the
time
was
brief
that
tenderness
whose
pity
grows
to
grief
and
grief
that
sanctifies
a
joy
a
charm
beyond
all
other
loves
for
now
the
arm
of
death
is
stretched
to
and
he
claims
you
as
his
bride
maybe
my
soul
misnames
its
passion
love
perhaps
it
is
not
yet
to
see
you
fading
like
a
violet
or
some
sweet
thought
away
would
be
a
strange
and
costly
pleasure
far
beyond
the
range
of
formal
man
emotion
listen
i
will
choose
a
country
spot
where
fields
of
rye
and
wheat
extend
in
rustling
yellow
plains
broken
with
wooded
hills
and
leafy
lanes
to
pass
our
honeymoon
a
cottage
where
the
porch
and
windows
are
festooned
with
fair
green
wreaths
of
eglantine
and
look
upon
a
shady
garden
where
we
walk
alone
in
the
autumn
sunny
evenings
each
will
see
our
walks
grow
shorter
till
to
the
orange
tree
the
garden
length
is
far
and
you
will
rest
from
time
to
time
leaning
upon
my
breast
your
languid
lily
face
then
later
still
unto
the
sofa
by
the
your
wasted
body
i
shall
carry
so
that
you
may
drink
the
last
left
lingering
glow
of
evening
when
the
air
is
filled
with
scent
of
blossoms
and
my
spirit
shall
be
rent
the
while
with
many
griefs
like
some
blue
day
that
grows
more
lovely
as
it
fades
away
gaining
that
calm
serenity
and
height
of
colour
wanted
as
the
solemn
night
steals
forward
you
will
sweetly
fall
asleep
for
ever
and
for
ever
i
shall
weep
a
day
and
night
large
tears
upon
your
face
laying
you
then
beneath
a
place
where
i
may
muse
and
dedicate
and
dream
volumes
of
poesy
of
you
and
deem
it
happiness
to
know
that
you
are
far
from
any
base
desires
as
that
fair
star
set
in
the
evening
magnitude
of
heaven
death
takes
but
little
yea
your
death
has
given
me
that
deep
peace
and
that
secure
possession
which
man
may
never
find
in
earthly
passion
and
here
are
two
specimens
of
my
french
verse
i
like
to
print
them
for
they
tell
me
how
i
have
held
together
and
they
are
not
worse
than
my
english
verse
and
is
my
english
verse
worse
than
the
verse
of
our
minor
poets
nuit
de
septembre
la
nuit
est
pleine
de
silence
et
dans
une
étrange
lueur
et
dans
une
douce
indolence
la
lune
dort
comme
une
fleur
parmi
rochers
dans
le
sable
sous
les
grands
pins
calme
amer
surgit
mon
amour
périssable
faim
de
tes

soif
de
ta
chair
je
suis
ton
amant
et
la
blonde
gorge
tremble
sous
mon
baiser
et
le
feu
de
inonde
nos
deux
cœurs
sans
les
apaiser
rien
ne
peut
durer
mais
ta
bouche
est
telle
fruit
fait
de
sang
tout
passe
mais
ta
main
me
touche
et
je
me
donne
en
frémissant
tes
yeux
verts
me
regardent
le
clair
de

de
tes

et
je
ne
vois
dans
le

même
que
ton
corps
rare
et
radieux
pour
un
tableau
de
lord
leighton
de
quoi
de
fleurs
ou
de
pleurs
de
quoi
rêvent
ces
douces
femmes
de
leurs
amours
ou
de
leurs
âmes
parcilles
aux
lis
abattus
elles
dorment
les
rêves
tus
dans
la
grande
fenêtre
ovale
ou
la
nuit
estivale
but
i
realised
before
i
was
thirty
that
minor
poetry
is
not
sufficient
occupation
for
a
i
realised
that
fact
suddenly
i
remember
the
very
place
at
the
corner
of
wellington
street
in
the
strand
and
these
poems
were
the
last
efforts
of
my
muse
the
sweetness
of
the
past
as
sailors
watch
from
their
prison
for
the
faint
grey
line
of
the
coasts
i
look
to
the
past
and
joys
come
over
in
hosts
like
the
white
sea
birds
from
their
roosts
i
love
not
the
indelicate
present
the
future
unknown
to
our
quest
is
the
life
of
the
peasant
but
the
past
is
a
haven
of
rest
the
things
of
the
past
are
the
best
the
rose
of
the
past
is
better
than
the
rose
we
ravish
is
holier
purer
and
fitter
to
place
on
the
shrine
where
we
pray
for
the
secret
thoughts
we
obey
in
the
past
nothing
dies
nothing
changes
in
the
past
all
is
lovely
and
still
no
grief
nor
fate
that
estranges
nor
hope
that
no
life
can
fulfil
but
ethereal
shelter
from
ill
the
coarser
delights
of
the
hour
tempt
and
debauch
and
deprave
and
we
joy
in
a
flitting
flower
knowing
that
nothing
can
save
our
flesh
from
the
fate
of
the
grave
but
sooner
or
later
returning
in
grief
to
the
nest
our
souls
filled
with
infinite
yearning
we
cry
there
is
rest
there
is
rest
in
the
past
its
joys
are
the
best
nostalgia
fair
were
the
dreamful
days
of
old
when
in
the
summer
sleepy
shade
beneath
the
beeches
on
the
wold
the
shepherds
lay
and
gently
played
music
to
maidens
who
afraid
drew
all
together
rapturously
their
white
soft
hands
like
white
leaves
laid
in
the
old
dear
days
of
arcady
men
were
not
then
as
they
are
now
haunted
and
terrified
by
creeds
they
sought
not
then
nor
cared
to
know
the
end
that
as
a
magnet
leads
nor
told
with
austere
fingers
beads
nor
reasoned
with
their
grief
and
glee
but
rioted
in
pleasant
meads
in
the
old
dear
days
of
arcady
the
future
may
be
wrong
or
right
the
present
is
a
hopeless
wrong
for
life
and
love
have
lost
delight
and
bitter
even
is
our
song
and
year
by
year
grey
doubt
grows
strong
and
death
is
all
that
seems
to
dree
wherefore
with
weary
hearts
we
long
for
the
old
dear
days
of
arcady
envoi
glories
and
triumphs
shall
cease
but
men
may
sound
the
heavens
and
sea
one
thing
is
lost
for
aye
the
peace
of
the
old
dear
days
of
arcady
and
so
it
was
that
i
came
to
settle
down
in
a
strand
determined
to
devote
myself
to
literature
and
to
accept
the
hardships
of
a
literary
life
i
had
been
playing
long
enough
and
was
now
anxious
for
proof
peremptory
proof
of
my
capacity
or
incapacity
a
book
no
an
immediate
answer
was
required
and
journalism
alone
could
give
that
so
did
i
reason
in
the
strand
and
what
led
me
to
that
house
chance
or
a
friend
recommendation
i
forget
it
was
uncomfortable
ugly
and
not
very
clean
but
curious
as
all
things
are
curious
when
examined
closely
let
me
tell
you
about
my
rooms
the
was
a
good
deal
longer
than
it
was
wide
it
was
panelled
with
deal
and
the
deal
was
painted
a
light
brown
behind
it
there
was
a
large
bedroom
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
ragged
carpet
and
a
big
bed
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
but
next
to
the
was
a
small
bedroom
which
was
let
for
ten
shillings
a
week
and
the
partition
wall
was
so
thin
that
i
could
hear
every
movement
the
occupant
made
this
proximity
was
intolerable
and
eventually
i
decided
on
adding
ten
shillings
to
my
rent
and
i
became
the
possessor
of
the
entire
flat
in
the
room
above
me
lived
a
pretty
young
woman
an
actress
at
the
savoy
theatre
she
had
a
piano
and
she
used
to
play
and
sing
in
the
mornings
and
in
the
afternoon
friends
girls
from
the
theatre
used
to
come
and
see
her
and
emma
the
used
to
take
them
up
their
tea
and
oh
the
chattering
and
the
laughter
poor
miss
l
she
had
only
two
pounds
a
week
to
live
on
but
she
was
always
in
high
spirits
except
when
she
could
not
pay
the
hire
of
her
piano
and
i
am
sure
that
she
now
looks
back
with
pleasure
and
thinks
of
those
days
as
very
happy
ones
she
was
a
tall
girl
a
thin
figure
and
she
had
large
brown
eyes
she
liked
young
men
and
she
hoped
that
mr
gilbert
would
give
her
a
line
or
two
in
his
next
opera
often
have
i
come
out
on
the
landing
to
meet
her
we
used
to
sit
on
those
stairs
talking
long
after
midnight
of
what
of
our
landlady
of
the
theatre
of
the
most
suitable
ways
of
enjoying
ourselves
in
life
one
night
she
told
me
she
was
married
it
was
a
solemn
moment
i
asked
in
a
sympathetic
voice
why
she
was
not
living
with
her
husband
she
told
me
but
the
reason
of
the
separation
i
have
forgotten
in
the
many
similar
reasons
for
separations
and
partings
which
have
since
been
confided
to
me
the
landlady
resented
our
intimacy
and
i
believe
miss
l
was
charged
indirectly
for
her
conversations
with
me
in
the
bill
on
the
first
floor
there
was
a
large
and
bedroom
solitary
rooms
that
were
nearly
always
unlet
the
landlady
parlour
was
on
the
ground
floor
her
bedroom
was
next
to
it
and
further
on
was
the
entrance
to
the
kitchen
stairs
whence
ascended
mrs
s
brood
of
children
and
emma
the
awful
servant
with
tea
things
many
various
smells
that
of
ham
and
eggs
predominating
emma
i
remember
you
you
are
not
to
be
forgotten
up
at
five
every
morning
scouring
washing
cooking
dressing
those
infamous
children
seventeen
hours
at
least
out
of
the
at
the
beck
and
call
of
landlady
lodgers
and
quarrelling
children
seventeen
hours
at
least
out
of
the
drudging
in
that
horrible
kitchen
running
up
stairs
with
coals
and
breakfasts
and
cans
of
hot
water
down
on
your
knees
before
a
grate
pulling
out
the
cinders
with
those
hands
can
i
call
them
hands
the
lodgers
sometimes
threw
you
a
kind
word
but
never
one
that
recognised
that
you
were
akin
to
us
only
the
pity
that
might
be
extended
to
a
dog
and
i
used
to
ask
you
all
sorts
of
cruel
questions
i
was
curious
to
know
the
depth
of
animalism
you
had
sunk
to
or
rather
out
of
which
you
had
never
been
raised
and
generally
you
answered
innocently
and
naïvely
enough
but
sometimes
my
words
were
too
crude
and
they
struck
through
the
thick
hide
into
the
quick
into
the
human
and
you
winced
a
little
but
this
was
rarely
for
you
were
very
nearly
oh
very
nearly
an
animal
your
temperament
and
intelligence
were
just
those
of
a
dog
that
has
picked
up
a
master
not
a
real
master
but
a
makeshift
master
who
may
turn
it
out
at
any
moment
dickens
would
sentimentalise
or
laugh
over
you
i
do
neither
i
merely
recognise
you
as
one
of
the
facts
of
civilisation
you
looked
well
to
be
candid
you
looked
neither
young
nor
old
hard
work
had
obliterated
the
delicate
markings
of
the
years
and
left
you
in
round
numbers
something
over
thirty
your
hair
was
reddish
brown
and
your
face
wore
that
plain
honest
look
that
is
so
essentially
english
the
rest
of
you
was
a
mass
of
stuffy
clothes
and
when
you
rushed
up
stairs
i
saw
something
that
did
not
look
like
legs
a
horrible
rush
that
was
of
yours
a
sort
of
bound
i
have
spoken
angrily
to
you
i
have
heard
others
speak
angrily
to
you
but
never
did
that
sweet
face
of
yours
for
it
was
a
sweet
face
that
sweet
natural
goodness
that
is
so
sublime
lose
its
expression
of
perfect
and
unfailing
kindness
words
convey
little
sense
of
the
real
horrors
of
the
reality
life
in
your
case
meant
this
to
be
born
in
a
slum
and
to
leave
it
to
work
seventeen
hours
a
day
in
a
to
be
a
londoner
but
to
know
only
the
slum
in
which
you
were
born
and
the
few
shops
in
the
strand
at
which
the
landlady
dealt
to
know
nothing
of
london
meant
in
your
case
not
to
know
that
it
was
not
england
england
and
london
you
could
not
distinguish
between
them
was
england
an
island
or
a
mountain
you
had
no
notion
i
remember
when
you
heard
that
miss
l
was
going
to
america
you
asked
me
and
the
question
was
sublime
is
she
going
to
travel
all
night
you
had
heard
people
speak
of
travelling
all
night
and
that
was
all
you
knew
of
travel
or
any
place
that
was
not
the
strand
i
asked
you
if
you
went
to
church
and
you
said
no
it
makes
my
eyes
bad
i
said
but
you
do
read
you
ca
read
no
but
i
have
to
look
at
the
book
i
asked
you
if
you
had
heard
of
god
you
had
but
when
i
pressed
you
on
the
point
you
suspected
i
was
laughing
at
you
and
you
would
not
answer
and
when
i
tried
you
again
on
the
subject
i
could
see
that
the
landlady
had
been
telling
you
what
to
say
but
you
had
not
understood
and
your
conscious
ignorance
grown
conscious
within
the
last
couple
of
days
was
even
more
pitiful
than
your
unconscious
ignorance
when
you
answered
that
you
could
go
to
church
because
it
made
your
eyes
bad
it
is
a
strange
thing
to
know
nothing
for
instance
to
live
in
london
and
to
have
no
notion
of
the
house
of
commons
nor
indeed
of
the
queen
except
perhaps
that
she
is
a
rich
lady
the
police
yes
you
knew
what
a
policeman
was
because
you
used
to
be
sent
to
fetch
one
to
make
an
or
a
christy
minstrel
move
on
to
know
of
nothing
but
a
dark
kitchen
grates
eggs
and
bacon
dirty
children
to
work
seventeen
hours
a
day
and
to
get
cheated
out
of
your
wages
to
answer
when
asked
why
you
did
not
get
your
wages
or
leave
if
you
were
paid
that
you
did
know
how
mrs
s
would
get
on
without
me
this
woman
owed
you
forty
pounds
i
think
so
i
calculated
it
from
what
you
told
me
and
yet
you
did
not
like
to
leave
her
because
you
did
not
know
how
she
would
get
on
without
you
sublime
stupidity
at
this
point
your
intelligence
stopped
i
remember
you
once
spoke
of
a
i
questioned
you
and
i
found
your
idea
of
a
was
to
take
the
children
for
a
walk
and
buy
them
some
sweets
i
told
my
brother
of
this
and
he
said
emma
out
for
a
why
you
might
as
well
give
a
mule
a
holiday
the
phrase
was
brutal
but
it
was
admirably
descriptive
of
you
yes
you
are
a
mule
there
is
no
sense
in
you
you
are
a
beast
of
burden
a
drudge
too
horrible
for
anything
but
work
and
i
suppose
all
things
considered
that
the
fat
landlady
with
a
dozen
children
did
well
to
work
you
seventeen
hours
a
day
and
cheat
you
out
of
your
miserable
wages
you
had
no
friends
you
could
not
have
a
friend
unless
it
were
some
forlorn
cat
or
dog
but
you
once
spoke
to
me
of
your
brother
who
worked
in
a
potato
store
and
i
was
astonished
and
i
wondered
if
he
were
as
awful
as
you
poor
emma
i
shall
never
forget
your
kind
heart
and
your
unfailing
good
humour
you
were
born
beautifully
good
as
a
rose
is
born
with
perfect
perfume
you
were
as
unconscious
of
your
goodness
as
the
rose
of
its
perfume
and
you
were
taken
by
this
fat
landlady
as
takes
a
rose
and
sticks
it
in
his
coat
and
you
will
be
thrown
away
shut
out
of
doors
when
health
fails
you
or
when
overcome
by
base
usage
you
take
to
drink
there
is
no
hope
for
you
even
if
you
were
treated
better
and
paid
your
wages
there
would
be
no
hope
those
forty
pounds
even
if
they
were
given
to
you
would
bring
you
no
good
fortune
they
would
bring
the
idle
loafer
who
scorns
you
now
as
something
too
low
for
even
his
kisses
hanging
about
your
heels
and
whispering
in
your
ears
and
his
whispering
would
drive
you
mad
for
your
kind
heart
longs
for
kind
words
and
then
when
he
had
spent
your
money
and
cast
you
off
in
despair
the
gin
shop
and
the
river
would
do
the
rest
providence
is
very
wise
after
all
and
your
best
destiny
is
your
present
one
we
can
not
add
a
pain
nor
can
we
take
away
a
pain
we
may
alter
but
we
can
not
subtract
nor
even
alleviate
but
what
truisms
are
these
who
believes
in
philanthropy
nowadays
come
in
oh
it
is
you
emma
are
you
going
to
dine
at
home
sir
what
can
i
have
well
yer
can
a
chop
or
a
steak
anything
else
yes
yer
can
a
steak
or
a
chop
or
oh
yes
i
know
well
then
i
have
a
chop
and
now
tell
me
emma
how
is
your
young
man
i
hear
you
have
got
one
you
went
out
with
him
the
other
night
who
told
yer
that
ah
never
mind
i
hear
everything
i
know
from
miss
l
well
tell
me
how
did
you
meet
him
who
introduced
him
i
met
as
i
was
from
the
public
with
the
beer
for
missus
dinner
and
what
did
he
say
he
asked
me
if
i
was
engaged
i
said
no
and
he
come
round
down
the
lane
that
evening
and
he
took
you
out
yes
and
where
did
you
go
we
went
for
a
walk
on
the
embankment
and
when
is
he
coming
for
you
again
he
said
he
was
coming
last
evening
but
he
did
why
did
he
i
dunno
i
suppose
because
i
have
time
to
go
out
with
him
so
it
was
miss
l
that
told
you
well
you
do
chats
on
the
stairs
i
suppose
you
likes
talking
to
i
like
talking
to
everybody
emma
i
like
talking
to
you
yes
but
not
as
you
talks
to
i
you
jes
do
fine
times
she
said
this
morning
that
she
had
not
seen
you
for
this
last
two
nights
that
you
had
forgotten
and
i
was
to
tell
yer
very
well
i
come
out
and
speak
to
her
and
missus
is
so
wild
about
it
and
she
dare
say
nothing
she
thinks
yer
might
go
a
young
man
in
a
house
full
of
women
must
be
almost
supernaturally
unpleasant
if
he
does
not
occupy
a
great
deal
of
their
attention
certain
at
least
it
is
that
i
was
the
point
of
interest
in
that
house
and
i
found
there
that
the
practice
of
virtue
is
not
so
disagreeable
as
many
young
men
think
it
the
fat
landlady
hovered
round
my
doors
and
i
obtained
perfectly
fresh
eggs
by
merely
keeping
her
at
her
distance
the
pretty
actress
with
whom
i
used
to
sympathise
with
on
the
stairs
at
midnight
loved
me
better
and
our
intimacy
was
more
strange
and
subtle
because
it
was
pure
and
it
was
not
quite
unpleasant
to
know
that
the
awful
servant
dreamed
of
me
as
she
might
of
a
star
or
something
equally
unattainable
but
the
landlady
daughter
a
nasty
girl
of
fifteen
annoyed
me
with
her
ogling
which
was
a
little
revolting
but
the
rest
was
and
i
speak
quite
candidly
not
wholly
unpleasant
it
was
not
aristocratic
it
is
true
but
i
repeat
it
was
not
unpleasant
nor
do
i
believe
that
any
young
man
however
refined
would
have
found
it
unpleasant
but
if
i
was
offered
a
choice
between
a
chop
and
steak
in
the
evening
in
the
morning
i
had
to
decide
between
eggs
and
bacon
and
bacon
and
eggs
a
knocking
at
the
door
nine
sir
water
sir
what
will
you
have
for
breakfast
what
can
i
have
anything
you
like
sir
you
can
have
bacon
and
eggs
or
anything
else
pause
well
sir
you
can
have
eggs
and
bacon
or
well
i
have
eggs
and
bacon
the
streets
seemed
to
me
like
rat
holes
dark
and
wandering
as
chance
directed
with
just
an
occasional
rift
of
sky
seen
as
if
through
an
occasional
crevice
so
different
from
the
boulevards
widening
out
into
bright
space
with
fountains
and
clouds
of
green
foliage
the
modes
of
life
were
so
essentially
opposed
i
am
thinking
now
of
intellectual
rather
than
physical
comforts
i
could
put
up
with
even
food
but
i
found
it
difficult
to
forego
the
glitter
and
artistic
enthusiasm
of
the
the
tavern
i
had
heard
of
the
tavern
some
seventy
years
ago
the
club
superseded
the
tavern
and
since
then
all
literary
intercourse
has
ceased
in
london
literary
clubs
have
been
founded
and
their
leather
have
begotten
mr
gosse
but
the
tavern
gave
the
world
villon
and
marlowe
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
what
is
wanted
is
enthusiasm
and
and
the
very
aspect
of
a
tavern
is
a
snort
of
defiance
at
the
hearth
the
leather
are
so
many
salaams
to
it
i
ask
did
anyone
ever
see
a
gay
club
room
can
any
one
imagine
such
a
thing
you
ca
have
a
without
mahogany
tables
you
ca
have
mahogany
tables
without
magazines
with
a
serial
by
rider
haggard
the
with
an
article
the
rehabilitation
of
the
pimp
in
modern
society
by
gladstone
a
dulness
that
a
purge
to
good
spirits
an
aperient
to
enthusiasm
in
a
word
a
dulness
that
worth
a
thousand
a
year
you
ca
have
a
club
without
a
waiter
in
red
plush
and
silver
salver
in
his
hand
then
you
ca
bring
a
lady
to
a
club
and
you
have
to
get
into
a
corner
to
talk
about
them
therefore
i
say
a
club
is
dull
as
the
hearth
and
home
grew
it
became
impossible
for
the
husband
to
tell
his
wife
that
he
was
going
to
the
tavern
everyone
can
go
to
the
tavern
and
no
place
in
england
where
everyone
can
go
is
considered
respectable
this
is
the
genesis
of
the
club
out
of
the
housewife
by
respectability
nowadays
everyone
is
respectable
jockeys
actors
and
even
actresses
mrs
kendal
takes
her
children
to
visit
a
duchess
and
has
naughty
chorus
girls
to
tea
and
tells
them
of
the
joy
of
respectability
there
is
only
one
class
left
that
is
not
respectable
and
that
will
succumb
before
long
how
the
transformation
will
be
effected
i
ca
say
but
i
know
an
editor
or
two
who
would
be
glad
of
an
article
on
the
subject
respectability
a
suburban
villa
a
piano
in
the
and
going
home
to
dinner
such
things
are
no
doubt
very
excellent
but
they
do
not
promote
intensity
of
feeling
fervour
of
mind
and
as
art
is
in
itself
an
outcry
against
the
animality
of
human
existence
it
would
be
well
that
the
life
of
the
artist
should
be
a
practical
protest
against
the
decencies
of
life
and
he
can
best
protest
by
frequenting
a
tavern
and
cutting
his
club
in
the
past
the
artist
has
always
been
an
outcast
it
is
only
latterly
he
has
become
domesticated
and
judging
by
results
it
is
clear
that
if
bohemianism
is
not
a
necessity
it
is
at
least
an
adjuvant
for
if
long
locks
and
general
dissoluteness
were
not
an
aid
and
a
way
to
pure
thought
why
have
they
been
so
long
his
characteristics
if
lovers
were
not
necessary
for
the
development
of
poet
novelist
and
actress
why
have
they
always
had
lovers

of
the
transformation
a

must

for
only

sin

a

than

if
she

wait
in

and
has
been

she
will
have

and
when
mr

of

be
when

i
ask
whence
will
the

draw
their

our
plight
is
pitiable
enough
the

they

the
same
oaths
they
speak
equally
bad

they
love

such
a
state

things
is
dreary
enough
but
what
unimaginable
dreariness
there
will
be
when
there
are
neither
rich
nor

when
all
have
been
educated
when
has
ceased

far

are
mild

gracious
symbols
compared
with
that
menacing

universal
education
with
which
we
are
threatened
which
has
already
eunuched
the
genius
of
the
last
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
produced
a
limitless
abortion
in
that
of
future
time
education
i
tremble
before
thy
dreaded
name
the
cruelties
of
nero
of
caligula
what
were
they
a
few
crunched
limbs
in

but
thine
o

are
the
yearning
of
souls
sick
of
life
of
maddening
discontent
of
all
the
fearsome
and
fathomless
sufferings
of
the
mind
when
goethe
said
more
light
he
said
the
wickedest
and
most
infamous
words
that
human
lips
ever
spoke
in
old
days
when
a
people
became
too
highly
civilised
the
barbarians
came
down
from
the
north
and
regenerated
that
nation
with
darkness
but
now
there
are
no
more
barbarians
and
sooner
or
later
i
am
convinced
that
we
shall
have
to
end
the
evil
by
summary
edicts
the
obstruction
no
doubt
will
be
severe
the
equivalents
of
gladstone
and
morley
will
stop
at
nothing
to
defeat
the
bill
but
it
will
nevertheless
be
carried
by
patriotic
conservative
and
unionist
majorities
and
it
will
be
written
in
the
statute
book
that
not
more
than
one
child
in
a
hundred
shall
be
taught
to
read
and
no
more
than
one
in
ten
thousand
shall
learn
the
piano
such
will
be
the
end
of
respectability
but
the
end
is
still
far
distant
we
are
now
in
a
period
of
decadence
growing
steadily
more
and
more
acute
the
old
gods
are
falling
about
us
there
is
little
left
to
raise
our
hearts
and
minds
to
and
amid
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
things
only
a
snobbery
is
left
to
us
thank
heaven
deeply
graven
in
the
english
heart
the
snob
is
now
the
ark
that
floats
triumphant
over
the
democratic
wave
the
faith
of
the
old
world
reposes
in
his
breast
and
he
shall
proclaim
it
when
the
waters
have
subsided
in
the
meanwhile
respectability
having
destroyed
the
tavern
and
created
the
club
continues
to
exercise
a
meretricious
and
enervating
influence
on
literature
all
audacity
of
thought
and
expression
has
been
stamped
out
and
the
conventionalities
are
rigorously
respected
it
has
been
said
a
thousand
times
that
an
art
is
only
a
reflection
of
a
certain
age
quite
so
only
certain
ages
are
more
interesting
than
others
and
consequently
produce
better
art
just
as
certain
seasons
produce
better
crops
we
heard
in
the
nouvelle
athènes
how
the
democratic
movement
in
other
words
respectability
in
other
words
education
has
extinguished
the
handicrafts
it
was
admitted
that
in
the
more
individual
arts
painting
and
poetry
men
would
be
always
found
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
a
picture
or
a
poem
but
no
man
is
after
all
so
immeasurably
superior
to
the
age
he
lives
in
as
to
be
able
to
resist
it
wholly
he
must
draw
sustenance
from
some
quarter
and
the
contemplation
of
the
past
will
not
suffice
then
the
pressure
on
him
from
without
is
as
water
upon
the
diver
and
sooner
or
later
he
grows
fatigued
and
comes
to
the
surface
to
breathe
he
is
as
a
pursued
by
sharks
below
and
cruel
birds
above
and
he
neither
dives
as
deep
nor
flies
as
high
as
his
freer
and
stronger
ancestry
a
daring
spirit
in
the
nineteenth
century
would
have
been
but
a
timid
nursery
soul
indeed
in
the
sixteenth
we
want
tumult
and
war
to
give
us
forgetfulness
sublime
moments
of
peace
to
enjoy
a
kiss
in
but
we
are
expected
to
be
home
to
dinner
at
seven
and
to
say
and
do
nothing
that
might
shock
the
neighbours
respectability
has
wound
itself
about
society
a
sort
of
octopus
and
nowhere
are
you
quite
free
from
one
of
its
horrible
suckers
the
power
of
the
villa
residence
is
supreme
art
science
politics
religion
it
has
transformed
to
suit
its
requirements
the
villa
goes
to
the
academy
the
villa
goes
to
the
theatre
and
therefore
the
art
of
is
mildly
realistic
not
the
great
realism
of
idea
but
the
puny
reality
of
materialism
not
the
deep
poetry
of
a
peter
de
hogue
but
the
meanness
of
a
frith
not
the
winged
realism
of
balzac
but
the
degrading
naturalism
of
a
coloured
photograph
to
my
mind
there
is
no
sadder
spectacle
of
artistic
debauchery
than
a
london
theatre
the
overfed
inhabitants
of
the
villa
in
the
stalls
hoping
for
gross
excitement
to
assist
them
through
their
hesitating
digestions
an
ignorant
mob
in
the
pit
and
gallery
forgetting
the
miseries
of
life
in
imbecile
stories
reeking
of
the
sentimentality
of
the
back
stairs
were
other
ages
as
coarse
and
common
as
ours
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
elizabethan
audiences
as
not
more
intelligent
than
those
that
applaud
mr
pettit
plays
impossible
that
an
audience
that
could
sit
out
edward
ii
could
find
any
pleasure
in
such
sinks
of
literary
infamies
as
the
and
artistic
atrophy
is
benumbing
us
we
are
losing
our
finer
feeling
for
beauty
the
rose
is
going
back
to
the
briar
i
will
not
speak
of
the
fine
old
crusted
stories
ever
the
same
on
which
every
drama
is
based
nor
yet
of
the
musty
characters
with
which
they
are
peopled
the
miser
in
the
old
castle
counting
his
gold
by
night
the
dishevelled
woman
whom
he
keeps
for
ambiguous
reasons
confined
in
a
cellar
let
all
this
be
waived
we
must
not
quarrel
with
the
ingredients
the
miser
and
the
old
castle
are
as
true
and
not
one
jot
more
true
than
the
million
events
which
go
to
make
up
the
phenomena
of
human
existence
not
at
these
things
considered
separately
do
i
take
umbrage
but
at
the
miserable
use
that
is
made
of
them
the
vulgarity
of
the
complications
evolved
from
them
and
the
poverty
of
beauty
in
the
dialogue
not
the
thing
itself
but
the
idea
of
the
thing
evokes
the
idea
schopenhauer
was
right
we
do
not
want
the
thing
but
the
idea
of
the
thing
the
thing
itself
is
worthless
and
the
moral
writers
who
embellish
it
with
pious
ornamentation
are
just
as
reprehensible
as
zola
who
embellishes
it
with
erotic
arabesques
you
want
the
idea
drawn
out
of
obscuring
matter
and
this
can
best
be
done
by
the
symbol
the
symbol
or
the
thing
itself
that
is
the
great
artistic
question
in
earlier
ages
it
was
the
symbol
a
name
a
plume
sufficed
to
evoke
the
idea
now
we
evoke
nothing
for
we
give
everything
the
imagination
of
the
spectator
is
no
longer
called
into
play
in
shakespeare
days
to
create
wealth
in
a
theatre
it
was
only
necessary
to
write
upon
a
board
a
magnificent
apartment
in
a
palace
this
was
no
doubt
primitive
and
not
a
little
barbarous
but
it
was
better
by
far
than
by
dint
of
anxious
archæology
to
construct
the
doge
palace
upon
the
stage
by
one
rich
pillar
by
some
projecting
balustrade
taken
in
conjunction
with
a
moored
gondola
we
should
strive
to
evoke
the
soul
of
the
city
of
veronese
by
the
magical
and
unequalled
selection
of
a
subtle
and
unexpected
feature
of
a
thought
or
aspect
of
a
landscape
and
not
by
the
of
extraneous
detail
are
all
great
poetic
effects
achieved
by
the
tideless
dolorous
inland
sea
in
a
land
of
sand
of
ruin
and
gold
and
better
example
still
dieu
que
le
son
du
cor
est
triste
au
fond
des
bois
that
impeccable
that
only
line
of
real
poetry
alfred
de
vigny
ever
wrote
being
a
great
poet
shakespeare
consciously
or
unconsciously
observed
more
faithfully
than
any
other
poet
these
principles
of
art
and
as
is
characteristic
of
the
present
day
nowhere
do
we
find
these
principles
so
grossly
violated
as
in
the
representation
of
his
plays
i
had
painful
proof
of
this
some
few
nights
after
my
arrival
in
london
i
had
never
seen
shakespeare
acted
and
i
went
to
the
lyceum
and
there
i
saw
that
exquisite
for
and
is
no
more
than
a
love
song
in
dialogue
tricked
out
in
silks
and
carpets
and
illuminated
building
a
vulgar
bawd
suited
to
the
gross
passion
of
an
ignorant
public
i
hated
all
that
with
the
hatred
of
a
passionate
heart
and
i
longed
for
a
simple
stage
a
few
simple
indications
and
the
simple
recitation
of
that
story
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
two
white
souls
for
the
reconciliation
of
two
great
families
my
hatred
did
not
reach
to
the
age
of
the
man
who
played
the
but
to
the
offensiveness
with
which
he
thrust
his
individuality
upon
me
longing
to
realise
the
divine
imagination
and
the
woman
too
i
wished
with
my
whole
soul
away
subtle
and
strange
though
she
was
and
i
yearned
for
her
part
to
be
played
by
a
youth
as
in
old
time
a
youth
cunningly
disguised
would
be
a
symbol
and
my
mind
would
be
free
to
imagine
the
divine
juliet
of
the
poet
whereas
i
could
but
dream
of
the
bright
eyes
and
delicate
mien
and
motion
of
the
woman
who
had
thrust
herself
between
me
and
it
but
not
with
symbol
and
subtle
suggestion
has
the
villa
to
do
but
with
such
stolid
intellectual
fare
as
corresponds
to
its
material
wants
the
villa
has
not
time
to
think
the
villa
is
the
working
bee
the
tavern
is
the
drone
it
has
no
boys
to
put
to
school
no
neighbours
to
study
and
is
therefore
a
little
more
refined
or
should
i
say
depraved
in
its
taste
the
villa
in
one
form
or
other
has
always
existed
and
always
will
exist
so
long
as
our
present
social
system
holds
together
it
is
the
basis
of
life
and
more
important
than
the
tavern
agreed
but
that
does
not
say
that
the
tavern
was
not
an
excellent
corrective
influence
to
the
villa
and
that
its
disappearance
has
not
had
a
vulgarising
effect
on
artistic
work
of
all
kinds
and
the
club
has
been
proved
impotent
to
replace
it
the
club
being
no
more
than
the
correlative
of
the
villa
let
the
reader
trace
villa
through
each
modern
feature
i
will
pass
on
at
once
to
the
circulating
library
at
once
the
symbol
and
glory
of
villaism
the
subject
is
not
unfamiliar
to
me
i
come
to
it
like
the
son
to
his
father
like
the
bird
to
its
nest
singularly
inappropriate
comparison
but
i
am
in
such
excellent
humour
humour
is
everything
it
is
said
that
the
tiger
will
sometimes
play
with
the
lamb
let
us
play
we
have
the
villa
well
in
our
mind
the
father
who
goes
to
the
city
in
the
morning
the
girls
waiting
to
be
married
the
big
where
they
play
waltz
music
and
talk
of
dancing
parties
but
waltzes
will
not
entirely
suffice
nor
even
tennis
the
girls
must
read
mother
can
not
keep
a
censor
it
is
as
much
as
she
can
do
to
keep
a
cook
housemaid
and
besides
the
expense
would
be
enormous
even
if
nothing
but
shilling
and
novels
were
purchased
out
of
such
circumstances
the
circulating
library
was
hatched
the
villa
made
known
its
want
and
art
fell
on
its
knees
pressure
was
put
on
the
publishers
and
books
were
published
at
the
dirty
outside
public
was
got
rid
of
and
the
villa
paid
its
yearly
subscription
and
had
nice
large
handsome
books
that
none
but
the
could
obtain
and
with
them
a
sense
of
being
put
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
my
lady
this
and
lady
that
and
certainty
that
nothing
would
come
into
the
hands
of
dear
kate
and
mary
and
maggie
that
they
might
not
read
and
all
for
two
guineas
a
year
english
fiction
became
pure
and
the
garlic
and
assafœtida
with
which
byron
fielding
and
ben
jonson
so
liberally
seasoned
their
works
and
in
spite
of
which
as
critics
say
they
were
geniuses
have
disappeared
from
our
literature
english
fiction
became
pure
dirty
stories
were
to
be
heard
no
more
were
no
longer
procurable
but
at
this
point
human
nature
intervened
poor
human
nature
when
you
pinch
it
in
one
place
it
bulges
out
in
another
after
the
fashion
of
a
lady
figure
human
nature
has
from
the
earliest
time
shown
a
liking
for
dirty
stories
dirty
stories
have
formed
a
substantial
part
of
every
literature
i
employ
the
words
dirty
stories
in
the
circulating
library
sense
therefore
a
taste
for
dirty
stories
may
be
said
to
be
inherent
in
the
human
animal
call
it
a
disease
if
you
will
an
incurable
disease
which
if
it
is
driven
inwards
will
break
out
in
an
unexpected
quarter
in
a
new
form
and
with
redoubled
virulence
this
is
exactly
what
has
happened
actuated
by
the
most
laudable
motives
mudie
cut
off
our
rations
of
dirty
stories
and
for
forty
years
we
were
apparently
the
most
moral
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
it
was
confidently
asserted
that
an
english
woman
of
sixty
would
not
read
what
would
bring
the
blush
of
shame
to
the
cheeks
of
a
maiden
of
any
other
nation
but
humiliation
and
sorrow
were
awaiting
mudie
true
it
is
that
we
still
continued
to
subscribe
to
his
library
true
it
is
that
we
still
continued
to
go
to
church
true
it
is
that
we
turned
our
faces
away
when
de
or
the
was
spoken
of
to
all
appearance
we
were
as
good
and
chaste
as
even
mudie
might
wish
us
and
no
doubt
he
looked
back
upon
his
forty
years
of
effort
with
pride
no
doubt
he
beat
his
manly
breast
and
said
i
have
scorched
the
evil
one
out
of
the
villa
the
head
of
the
serpent
is
crushed
for
evermore
but
lo
suddenly
with
all
the
horror
of
an
earthquake
the
slumbrous
law
courts
awoke
and
the
burning
cinders
of
fornication
and
the
blinding
and
suffocating
smoke
of
adultery
were
poured
upon
and
hung
over
the
land
through
the
mighty
columns
of
our
newspapers
the
terrible
lava
rolled
unceasing
and
in
the
black
stream
the
villa
with
all
its
beautiful
illusions
tumbled
and
disappeared
an
awful
and
terrifying
proof
of
the
futility
of
human
effort
that
there
is
neither
bad
work
nor
good
work
to
do
nothing
but
to
await
the
coming
of
the
nirvana
i
have
written
much
against
the
circulating
library
and
i
have
read
a
feeble
defence
or
two
but
i
have
not
seen
the
argument
that
might
be
legitimately
put
forward
in
its
favour
it
seems
to
me
this
the
circulating
library
is
conservatism
art
is
always
conservative
the
circulating
library
lifts
the
writer
out
of
the
precariousness
and
noise
of
the
wild
street
of
popular
fancy
into
a
quiet
place
where
passion
is
more
restrained
and
there
is
more
reflection
the
young
and
unknown
writer
is
placed
at
once
in
a
place
of
comparative
security
and
he
is
not
forced
to
employ
vile
and
degrading
methods
of
attracting
attention
the
known
writer
having
a
certain
market
for
his
work
is
enabled
to
think
more
of
it
and
less
of
the
immediate
acclamation
of
the
crowd
but
all
these
possible
advantages
are
destroyed
and
rendered
by
the
veracious
censorship
exercised
by
the
librarian
there
is
one
thing
in
england
that
is
free
that
is
spontaneous
that
reminds
me
of
the
blitheness
and
nationalness
of
the
continent
but
there
is
nothing
french
about
it
it
is
wholly
and
essentially
english
and
in
its
communal
enjoyment
and
its
spontaneity
it
is
a
survival
of
elizabethan
england
i
mean
the
the
french
seems
to
me
silly
effete
sophisticated
and
lacking
not
in
the
popularity
but
in
the
vulgarity
of
an
english
hall
i
will
not
say
the
pavilion
which
is
too
cosmopolitan
dreary
french
comics
are
heard
there
for
preference
let
us
say
the
royal
i
shall
not
easily
forget
my
first
evening
there
when
i
saw
for
the
time
a
living
house
the
dissolute
paragraphists
the
elegant
mashers
mark
the
imaginativeness
of
the
slang
the
stolid
costers
the
cheerful
lights
o
love
the
extraordinary
comics
what
delightful
unison
of
enjoyment
what
unanimity
of
soul
what
communality
of
wit
all
knew
each
other
all
enjoyed
each
other
presence
in
a
word
there
was
life
then
there
were
no
cascades
of
real
water
nor
london
docks
nor
offensively
rich
furniture
with
hotel
lifts
down
which
some
one
will
certainly
be
thrown
but
one
scene
representing
a
street
a
man
comes
on
not
mind
you
in
a
real
but
in
something
that
suggests
one
and
sings
of
how
he
came
up
to
london
and
was
cleaned
out
by
thieves
simple
you
will
say
yes
but
better
than
a
of
garnished
with
hags
imps
and
blue
flame
better
far
better
than
a
set
at
the
st
james
with
an
exhibition
of
passion
by
mrs
and
mr
kendal
better
a
million
times
better
than
the
cheap
popularity
of
wilson
barrett
an
elderly
man
posturing
in
a
dress
to
some
poor
trull
in
the
gallery
nor
is
there
in
the
hall
any
affectation
of
language
nor
that
rhetoric
which
reminds
you
of
a
playing
che
la
bad
enough
in
prose
but
when
set
up
in
blank
verse
awful
and
shocking
in
its
more
than
natural
deformity
but
bright
quips
and
cranks
fresh
from
the
of
the
slum
where
the
linen
is
drying
or
the
pub
where
the
unfortunate
wife
has
just
received
a
black
eye
that
will
last
her
a
week
that
inimitable
artist
bessie
bellwood
whose
native
wit
is
so
curiously
accentuated
that
it
is
sublimated
that
it
is
no
longer
repellent
vulgarity
but
art
choice
and
rare
see
here
she
comes
with
what
cheer
rea
rea
on
the
job
the
sketch
is
slight
but
is
welcome
and
refreshing
after
the
eternal
and
mrs
cumbrous
domesticity
it
is
curious
quaint
perverted
and
are
not
these
the
and
the
attributes
of
art
now
see
that
perfect
comedian
arthur
roberts
superior
to
irving
because
he
is
working
with
living
material
how
trim
and
saucy
he
is
and
how
he
evokes
the
soul
the
soul
of
the
young
men
delightful
and
elegant
in
black
and
white
who
are
so
vociferously
cheering
him
will
you
stand
me
a
ducky
i
am
feeling
so
awfully
queer
the
soul
the
spirit
the
entity
of
piccadilly
circus
is
in
the
words
and
the
scene
the
comedian
eyes
each
look
is
full
of
suggestion
it
is
irritating
it
is
magnetic
it
is
symbolic
it
is
art
not
art
but
a
sign
a
presentiment
of
an
art
that
may
grow
from
the
present
seeds
that
may
rise
into
some
stately
and
unpremeditated
efflorescence
as
the
rhapsodist
rose
to
sophocles
as
the
miracle
play
rose
through
peele
and
nash
to
marlowe
hence
to
the
wondrous
summer
of
shakespeare
to
die
later
on
in
the
mist
and
yellow
and
brown
of
the
autumn
of
crowes
and
davenants
i
have
seen
sketches
comic
interludes
that
in
their
unexpectedness
and
naïve
naturalness
remind
me
of
the
comic
passages
in
marlowe
i
waited
i
admit
in
vain
for
some
beautiful
phantom
to
appear
and
to
hear
an
enthusiastic
worshipper
cry
out
in
his
agony
was
this
the
face
that
launched
a
thousand
ships
and
burnt
the
topless
towers
of
ilium
sweet
helen
make
me
immortal
with
a
kiss
her
lips
suck
forth
my
soul
see
where
it
flies
come
helen
come
give
me
my
soul
again
here
will
i
dwell
for
heaven
is
in
these
lips
and
all
is
dross
that
is
not
helena
and
then
the
astonishing
change
of
key
i
will
be
paris
and
for
love
of
thee
instead
of
troy
shall
wurtemberg
be
sacked
etc
the
hall
is
at
least
a
protest
against
the
wearisome
stories
concerning
wills
misers
in
old
castles
lost
heirs
and
the
woeful
solutions
of
such
things
she
who
has
been
kept
in
the
castle
cellar
for
twenty
years
restored
to
the
delights
of
and
a
mauve
dress
the
to
the
protecting
arm
etc
the
is
a
protest
against
mrs
kendal
marital
tendernesses
and
the
abortive
platitudes
of
messrs
pettit
and
sims
the
is
a
protest
against
sardou
and
the
immense
sets
rich
hangings
velvet
sofas
so
different
from
the
movement
of
the
english
comedy
with
its
constant
change
of
scene
the
is
a
protest
against
the
villa
the
circulating
library
the
club
and
for
this
the
is
inexpressibly
dear
to
me
but
in
the
interests
of
those
illiterate
institutions
called
theatres
it
is
not
permissible
for
several
characters
to
narrate
events
in
which
there
is
a
sequel
by
means
of
dialogue
in
a
if
this
vexatious
restriction
were
removed
it
is
possible
if
it
is
not
certain
that
while
some
halls
remained
faithful
to
comic
songs
and
jugglers
others
would
gradually
learn
to
cater
for
more
intellectual
and
subtle
audiences
and
that
out
of
obscurity
and
disorder
new
dramatic
forms
coloured
and
permeated
by
the
thought
and
feeling
of
might
be
definitely
evolved
it
is
our
only
chance
of
again
possessing
a
dramatic
literature
xii
it
is
said
that
young
men
of
genius
come
to
london
with
great
poems
and
dramas
in
their
pockets
and
find
every
door
closed
against
them
chatterton
death
perpetuated
this
legend
but
when
i
george
moore
came
to
london
in
search
of
literary
adventure
i
found
a
ready
welcome
possibly
i
should
not
have
been
accorded
any
welcome
had
i
been
anything
but
an
ordinary
person
let
this
be
waived
i
was
as
covered
with
fads
as
a
distinguished
foreigner
with
stars
naturalism
i
wore
round
my
neck
romanticism
was
pinned
over
the
heart
symbolism
i
carried
like
a
toy
revolver
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
to
be
used
on
an
emergency
i
do
not
judge
whether
i
was
charlatan
or
genius
i
merely
state
that
i
found
all
actors
managers
editors
publishers
docile
and
ready
to
listen
to
me
the
world
may
be
wicked
cruel
and
stupid
but
it
is
patient
on
this
point
i
will
not
be
gainsaid
it
is
patient
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
i
maintain
that
the
world
is
patient
if
it
were
not
what
would
have
happened
i
should
have
been
murdered
by
the
editors
of
i
will
suppress
names
torn
in
pieces
by
the
and
devoured
by
the
office
boys
there
was
no
wild
theory
which
i
did
not
assail
them
with
there
was
no
strange
plan
for
the
instant
extermination
of
the
philistine
which
i
did
not
press
upon
them
and
here
i
must
whisper
with
a
fair
amount
of
success
not
complete
success
i
am
glad
to
say
that
would
have
meant
for
the
editors
a
change
from
their
to
the
benches
of
the
union
and
the
plank
beds
of
holloway
the
actress
when
she
returned
home
from
the
theatre
suggested
i
had
an
enemy
a
vindictive
enemy
who
dogged
my
steps
but
her
stage
experience
led
her
astray
i
had
no
enemy
except
myself
or
to
put
it
scientifically
no
enemy
except
the
logical
consequences
of
my
past
life
and
education
and
these
caused
me
a
great
and
real
inconvenience
french
wit
was
in
my
brain
french
sentiment
was
in
my
heart
of
the
english
soul
i
knew
nothing
and
i
could
not
remember
old
sympathies
it
was
like
seeking
forgotten
words
and
if
i
were
writing
a
short
story
i
had
to
return
in
thought
to
montmartre
or
the
champs
elysées
for
my
characters
that
i
should
have
forgotten
so
much
in
ten
years
seems
incredible
and
it
will
be
deemed
impossible
by
many
but
that
is
because
few
are
aware
of
how
little
they
know
of
the
details
of
life
even
of
their
own
and
are
incapable
of
appreciating
the
influence
of
their
past
upon
their
present
the
visible
world
is
visible
only
to
a
few
the
moral
world
is
a
closed
book
to
nearly
all
i
was
full
of
france
and
france
had
to
be
got
rid
of
or
pushed
out
of
sight
before
i
could
understand
england
i
was
like
a
snake
striving
to
slough
its
skin
handicapped
as
i
was
with
dangerous
ideas
and
an
impossible
style
defeat
was
inevitable
my
english
was
rotten
with
french
idiom
it
was
like
an
wall
overpowered
by
huge
masses
of
ivy
the
weak
foundations
had
given
way
beneath
the
weight
of
the
parasite
and
the
ideas
i
sought
to
give
expression
to
were
green
sour
and
immature
as
apples
in
august
therefore
before
long
the
leading
journal
that
had
printed
two
poems
and
some
seven
or
eight
critical
articles
ceased
to
send
me
books
for
review
and
i
fell
back
upon
obscure
society
papers
fortunately
it
was
not
incumbent
on
me
to
live
by
my
pen
so
i
talked
and
watched
and
waited
till
i
grew
akin
to
those
around
me
and
my
thoughts
blended
with
and
took
root
in
my
environment
i
wrote
a
play
or
two
i
translated
a
french
opera
which
had
a
run
of
six
nights
i
dramatized
a
novel
i
wrote
short
stories
and
i
read
a
good
deal
of
contemporary
fiction
the
first
book
that
came
under
my
hand
was
a
portrait
of
a
lady
by
henry
james
each
scene
is
developed
with
complete
foresight
and
certainty
of
touch
what
mr
james
wants
to
do
he
does
i
will
admit
that
an
artist
may
be
great
and
limited
by
one
word
he
may
light
up
an
abyss
of
soul
but
there
must
be
this
one
magical
and
unique
word
shakespeare
gives
us
the
word
balzac
sometimes
after
pages
of
vain
striving
gives
us
the
word
tourgueneff
gives
it
with
miraculous
certainty
but
henry
james
no
a
hundred
times
he
flutters
about
it
his
whole
book
is
one
long
flutter
near
to
the
one
magical
and
unique
word
but
the
word
is
not
spoken
and
for
want
of
the
word
his
characters
are
never
resolved
out
of
the
haze
of
nebulae
you
are
on
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
them
they
pass
you
in
the
street
they
stop
and
speak
to
you
you
know
how
they
are
dressed
you
watch
the
colour
of
their
eyes
when
i
think
of
a
portrait
of
a
lady
with
its
marvellous
crowd
of
people
it
comes
back
to
me
precisely
as
an
accurate
memory
of
a
fashionable
soirée
the
staircase
with
its
ascending
figures
the
hostess
smiling
the
host
at
a
little
distance
with
his
back
turned
some
one
calls
him
he
turns
i
can
see
his
white
kid
gloves
the
air
is
sugar
sweet
with
the
odour
of
the
gardenias
there
is
brilliant
light
here
there
is
shadow
in
the
further
rooms
the
feet
pass
to
and
fro
beneath
the
stiff
skirts
i
call
for
my
hat
and
coat
i
light
a
cigar
i
stroll
up
piccadilly
a
very
pleasant
evening
i
have
seen
a
good
many
people
i
knew
i
have
observed
an
attitude
and
an
earnestness
of
manner
that
proved
that
a
heart
was
beating
mr
james
might
say
if
i
have
done
this
i
have
done
a
great
deal
and
i
would
answer
no
doubt
you
are
a
man
of
great
talent
great
cultivation
and
not
at
all
of
the
common
herd
i
place
you
in
the
very
front
rank
not
only
of
novelists
but
of
men
of
letters
i
have
read
nothing
of
henry
james
that
did
suggest
the
manner
of
a
scholar
but
why
should
a
scholar
limit
himself
to
empty
and
endless
sentimentalities
i
will
not
taunt
him
with
any
of
the
old
taunts
why
does
he
not
write
complicated
stories
why
does
he
not
complete
his
stories
let
all
this
be
waived
i
will
ask
him
only
why
he
always
avoids
decisive
action
why
does
a
woman
never
say
i
will
why
does
a
woman
never
leave
the
house
with
her
lover
why
does
a
man
never
kill
a
man
why
does
a
man
never
kill
himself
why
is
nothing
ever
accomplished
in
real
life
murder
adultery
and
suicide
are
of
common
occurrence
but
mr
james
people
live
in
a
calm
sad
and
very
polite
twilight
of
volition
suicide
or
adultery
has
happened
before
the
story
begins
suicide
or
adultery
happens
some
years
hence
when
the
characters
have
left
the
stage
but
in
front
of
the
reader
nothing
happens
the
suppression
or
maintenance
of
story
in
a
novel
is
a
matter
of
personal
taste
some
prefer
to
adventures
some
adventures
to
that
you
can
not
have
both
at
once
i
take
to
be
a
proposition
so
when
mr
lang
says
i
like
adventures
i
say
oh
do
you
as
i
might
to
a
man
who
says
i
like
sherry
and
no
doubt
when
i
say
i
like
mr
lang
says
oh
do
you
as
he
might
to
a
man
who
says
i
like
port
but
mr
james
and
i
are
agreed
on
essentials
we
prefer
to
adventures
one
two
or
even
three
determining
actions
are
not
antagonistic
to
the
practice
of
balzac
and
flaubert
and
thackeray
prove
that
is
mr
james
of
the
same
mind
as
the
poet
verlaine
la
nuance
pas
la
couleur
seulement
la
nuance
tout
le
reste
est
littérature
in
connection
with
henry
james
i
had
often
heard
the
name
of
howells
i
bought
some
three
or
four
of
his
novels
i
found
them
pretty
very
pretty
but
nothing
more
a
sort
of
ashby
sterry
done
into
very
neat
prose
he
is
vulgar
as
henry
james
is
refined
he
is
more
domestic
girls
with
white
dresses
and
virginal
looks
languid
mammas
mild
witticisms
here
there
and
everywhere
a
couple
of
young
men
one
a
little
cynical
the
other
a
little
by
his
love
a
strong
bearded
man
of
fifty
in
the
background
in
a
word
a
tom
robertson
comedy
faintly
spiced
with
american
henry
james
went
to
france
and
read
tourgueneff
howells
stayed
at
home
and
read
henry
james
henry
james
mind
is
of
a
higher
cast
and
temper
i
have
no
doubt
at
one
time
of
his
life
henry
james
said
i
will
write
the
moral
history
of
america
as
tourgueneff
wrote
the
moral
history
of
russia
he
borrowed
at
first
hand
understanding
what
he
was
borrowing
howells
borrowed
at
second
hand
and
without
understanding
what
he
was
borrowing
altogether
mr
james
instincts
are
more
scholarly
although
his
reserve
irritates
me
and
i
often
regret
his
concessions
to
the
prudery
of
the
age
no
not
of
the
age
but
of
librarians
i
can
not
but
feel
that
his
concessions
for
i
suppose
i
must
call
them
concessions
are
to
a
certain
extent
regretfully
perhaps
somewhat
in
this
fashion
true
that
i
live
in
an
age
not
very
favourable
to
artistic
production
but
the
art
of
an
age
is
the
spirit
of
that
age
if
i
violate
the
prejudices
of
the
age
i
shall
miss
its
spirit
and
an
art
that
is
not
redolent
of
the
spirit
of
its
age
is
an
artificial
flower
perfumeless
or
perfumed
with
the
scent
of
flowers
that
bloomed
three
hundred
years
ago
plausible
ingenious
quite
in
the
spirit
of
mr
james
mind
i
can
almost
hear
him
reason
so
nor
does
the
argument
displease
me
for
it
is
conceived
in
a
scholarly
spirit
now
my
conception
of
howells
is
quite
different
i
see
him
the
happy
father
of
a
numerous
family
the
sun
is
shining
the
girls
and
boys
are
playing
on
the
lawn
they
come
trooping
in
to
high
tea
and
there
is
dancing
in
the
evening
my
fat
landlady
lent
me
a
novel
by
george
meredith
tragic
comedians
i
was
glad
to
receive
it
for
my
admiration
of
his
poetry
with
which
i
was
slightly
acquainted
was
very
genuine
indeed
love
in
a
valley
is
a
beautiful
poem
and
the
nuptials
of
attila
i
read
it
in
the
quarterly
years
ago
is
very
present
in
my
mind
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
recall
its
chanting
rhythm
and
lordly
and
sombre
refrain
make
the
bed
for
attila
i
expected
therefore
one
of
my
old
passionate
delights
from
his
novels
i
was
disappointed
painfully
disappointed
but
before
i
say
more
concerning
mr
meredith
i
will
admit
at
once
frankly
and
fearlessly
that
i
am
not
a
competent
critic
because
emotionally
i
do
not
understand
him
and
all
except
an
emotional
understanding
is
worthless
in
art
i
do
not
make
this
admission
because
i
am
intimidated
by
the
weight
and
height
of
the
critical
authority
with
which
i
am
overshadowed
but
from
a
certain
sense
of
which
i
am
as
distinctly
conscious
that
the
author
is
how
shall
i
put
it
the
french
would
say
that
expresses
what
i
would
say
in
english
i
remember
too
that
although
a
man
may
be
able
to
understand
anything
there
must
be
some
modes
of
thoughts
and
attitudes
of
mind
which
we
are
so
naturally
antagonistic
to
so
entirely
out
of
sympathy
with
that
we
are
in
no
true
sense
critics
of
them
such
are
the
thoughts
that
come
to
me
when
i
read
mr
george
meredith
i
try
to
console
myself
with
such
reflections
and
then
i
break
out
and
cry
passionately
jerks
wire
splintered
wood
in
balzac
which
i
know
by
heart
in
shakespeare
which
i
have
just
begun
to
love
i
find
words
deeply
impregnated
with
the
savour
of
life
but
in
george
meredith
there
is
nothing
but
crackjaw
sentences
empty
and
unpleasant
in
the
mouth
as
sterile
nuts
i
could
select
hundreds
of
phrases
which
mr
meredith
would
probably
call
epigrams
and
i
would
defy
anyone
to
say
they
were
wise
graceful
or
witty
i
do
not
know
any
book
more
tedious
than
tragic
comedians
more
pretentious
more
blatant
it
struts
and
screams
stupid
in
all
its
gaud
and
absurdity
as
a
cockatoo
more
than
fifty
pages
i
could
not
read
how
i
asked
myself
could
the
man
who
wrote
the
nuptials
of
attila
write
this
but
my
soul
returned
no
answer
and
i
listened
as
one
in
a
hollow
mountain
side
my
opinion
of
george
meredith
never
ceases
to
puzzle
me
he
is
of
the
north
i
am
of
the
south
carlyle
mr
robert
browning
and
george
meredith
are
the
three
essentially
northern
writers
in
them
there
is
nothing
of
latin
sensuality
and
subtlety
i
took
up
rhoda
fleming
i
found
some
exquisite
bits
of
description
in
it
but
i
heartily
wished
them
in
verse
they
were
motives
for
poems
and
there
was
some
wit
i
remember
a
passage
very
racy
indeed
of
england
antony
i
think
is
the
man
name
describes
how
he
is
interrupted
at
his
tea
a
paragraph
of
seven
or
ten
lines
with
i
am
having
my
tea
i
am
at
my
tea
running
through
it
for
refrain
then
a
description
of
a
dinner
a
block
of
bread
on
a
lonely
place
and
potatoes
that
looked
as
if
they
had
committed
suicide
in
their
own
steam
a
little
ponderous
and
stilted
but
undoubtedly
witty
i
read
on
until
i
came
to
a
young
man
who
fell
from
his
horse
or
had
been
thrown
from
his
horse
i
never
knew
which
nor
did
i
feel
enough
interest
in
the
matter
to
make
research
the
young
man
was
put
to
bed
by
his
mother
and
once
in
bed
he
began
to
talk
four
five
six
ten
pages
of
talk
and
such
talk
i
can
offer
no
opinion
why
mr
george
meredith
committed
them
to
paper
it
is
not
narrative
it
is
not
witty
nor
is
it
sentimental
nor
is
it
profound
i
read
it
once
my
mind
astonished
at
receiving
no
sensation
cried
out
like
a
child
at
a
milkless
breast
i
read
the
pages
again
did
i
understand
yes
i
understood
every
sentence
but
they
conveyed
no
idea
they
awoke
no
emotion
in
me
it
was
like
sand
arid
and
uncomfortable
the
story
is
surprisingly
commonplace
the
people
in
it
are
as
lacking
in
subtlety
as
those
of
a
drury
lane
melodrama
diana
of
the
crossways
i
liked
better
and
had
i
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
i
might
have
read
it
to
the
end
i
remember
a
scene
with
a
rustic
a
rustic
who
could
eat
hog
a
solid
hour
that
amused
me
i
remember
the
sloppy
road
in
the
weald
and
the
vague
outlines
of
the
south
downs
seen
in
starlight
and
mist
but
to
come
to
the
great
question
the
test
by
which
time
will
judge
us
all
the
creation
of
a
human
being
of
a
live
thing
that
we
have
met
with
in
life
before
and
meet
for
the
first
time
in
print
and
who
abides
with
us
ever
after
into
what
shadow
has
not
diana
floated
where
are
the
magical
glimpses
of
the
soul
do
you
remember
in
pères
et
enfants
when
tourgueneff
is
unveiling
the
woman
shall
i
say
affection
for
bazaroff
or
the
interest
she
feels
in
him
and
exposing
at
the
same
time
the
reasons
why
she
will
never
marry
him
i
wish
i
had
the
book
by
me
i
have
not
seen
it
for
ten
years
after
striving
through
many
pages
to
put
lucien
whom
you
would
have
loved
whom
i
would
have
loved
that
divine
representation
of
all
that
is
young
and
desirable
in
man
before
the
reader
balzac
puts
these
words
in
his
mouth
in
reply
to
an
impatient
question
by
vautrin
who
asks
him
what
he
wants
what
he
is
sighing
for
célèbre
et
these
are
words
these
are
shakespearean
words
where
in
diana
of
the
crossways
do
we
find
words
like
these
with
tiresome
repetition
we
are
told
that
she
is
beautiful
divine
but
i
see
her
not
at
all
i
do
know
if
she
is
dark
tall
or
fair
with
tiresome
reiteration
we
are
told
that
she
is
brilliant
that
her
conversation
is
like
a
display
of
fireworks
that
the
company
is
dazzled
and
overcome
but
when
she
speaks
the
utterances
are
grotesque
and
i
say
that
if
anyone
spoke
to
me
in
real
life
as
she
does
in
the
novel
i
should
not
doubt
for
an
instant
that
i
was
in
the
company
of
a
lunatic
the
epigrams
are
never
good
they
never
come
within
measurable
distance
of
la
rochefoucauld
balzac
or
even
gohcourt
the
admirers
of
mr
meredith
constantly
deplore
their
existence
admitting
that
they
destroy
all
illusion
of
life
when
we
have
translated
half
of
mr
meredith
utterances
into
possible
human
speech
then
we
can
enjoy
him
says
the
mall
we
take
our
pleasures
differently
mine
are
spontaneous
and
i
know
nothing
about
translating
the
rank
smell
of
a
nettle
into
the
fragrance
of
a
rose
and
then
enjoying
it
mr
meredith
conception
of
life
is
crooked
and
out
of
tune
what
remains
a
certain
lustiness
you
have
seen
a
big
man
with
square
shoulders
and
a
small
head
pushing
about
in
a
crowd
he
shouts
and
works
his
arms
he
seems
to
be
doing
a
great
deal
in
reality
he
is
doing
nothing
so
mr
meredith
appears
to
me
and
yet
i
can
only
think
of
him
as
an
artist
his
habit
is
not
slatternly
like
those
of
such
literary
hodmen
as
mr
david
christie
murray
mr
besant
mr
buchanan
there
is
no
trace
of
the
crowd
about
him
i
do
not
question
his
right
of
place
i
am
out
of
sympathy
with
him
that
is
all
and
i
regret
that
it
should
be
so
for
he
is
one
whose
love
of
art
is
pure
and
untainted
with
commercialism
and
if
i
may
praise
it
for
nought
else
i
can
praise
it
for
this
i
have
noticed
that
if
i
buy
a
book
because
i
am
advised
or
because
i
think
i
ought
my
reading
is
sure
to
prove
sterile
faut
que
cela
vienne
de
as
a
woman
once
said
to
me
speaking
of
her
caprices
a
quotation
a
chance
word
heard
in
an
unexpected
quarter
mr
hardy
and
mr
blackmore
i
read
because
i
had
heard
that
they
were
distinguished
novelists
neither
touched
me
i
might
just
as
well
have
bought
a
daily
paper
neither
like
nor
dislike
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
that
is
all
hardy
seems
to
me
to
bear
about
the
same
relation
to
george
eliot
as
jules
breton
does
to
millet
a
vulgarisation
never
offensive
and
executed
with
ability
the
story
of
an
art
is
always
the
same
a
succession
of
abortive
but
ever
strengthening
efforts
a
moment
of
supreme
concentration
a
succession
of
efforts
weakening
the
final
extinction
george
eliot
gathered
up
all
previous
attempts
and
created
the
english
peasant
and
following
her
peasants
there
came
an
endless
crowd
from
devon
yorkshire
and
the
midland
counties
and
as
they
came
they
faded
into
the
palest
shadows
until
at
last
they
appeared
in
red
stockings
high
heels
and
were
lost
in
the
chorus
of
opera
mr
hardy
was
the
first
step
down
his
work
is
what
dramatic
critics
would
call
good
honest
straightforward
work
it
is
unillumined
by
a
ray
of
genius
it
is
slow
and
somewhat
sodden
it
reminds
me
of
an
excellent
family
coach
one
of
the
old
sort
hung
on
c
springs
a
fat
coachman
on
the
box
and
a
footman
whose
livery
was
made
for
his
predecessor
in
criticising
mr
meredith
i
was
out
of
sympathy
with
my
author
ill
at
ease
angry
puzzled
but
with
mr
hardy
i
am
on
quite
different
terms
i
am
as
familiar
with
him
as
with
the
old
pair
of
trousers
i
put
on
when
i
sit
down
to
write
i
know
all
about
his
aims
his
methods
i
know
what
has
been
done
in
that
line
and
what
can
be
done
i
have
heard
that
mr
hardy
is
country
bred
but
i
should
not
have
discovered
this
from
his
writings
they
read
to
me
more
like
a
report
yes
a
report
a
conscientious
report
executed
by
a
thoroughly
efficient
writer
sent
down
by
one
of
the
daily
papers
nowhere
do
i
find
selection
everything
is
reported
dialogues
and
descriptions
take
for
instance
the
long
evening
talk
between
the
farm
people
when
oak
is
seeking
employment
it
is
not
the
absolute
and
literal
transcript
from
nature
after
the
manner
of
henri
monier
for
that
it
is
a
little
too
diluted
with
mr
hardy
brains
the
edges
are
a
little
sharpened
and
pointed
i
can
see
where
the
author
has
been
at
work
filing
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
synthesized
the
magical
word
which
reveals
the
past
and
through
which
we
divine
the
future
is
not
seized
and
set
triumphantly
as
it
is
in
silas
marner
the
descriptions
do
not
flow
out
of
and
form
part
of
the
narrative
but
are
wedged
in
and
often
awkwardly
we
are
invited
to
assist
at
a
scene
or
at
a
harvest
supper
because
these
scenes
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
works
of
george
eliot
because
the
reader
is
supposed
to
be
interested
in
such
things
because
mr
hardy
is
anxious
to
show
how
jolly
country
he
is
collegians
when
they
attempt
create
monstrosities
but
a
practised
writer
should
be
able
to
create
men
and
women
capable
of
moving
through
a
certain
series
of
situations
without
shocking
in
any
violent
way
the
most
generally
applicable
principles
of
common
sense
i
say
that
a
practised
writer
should
be
able
to
do
this
that
they
sometimes
do
not
is
a
matter
which
i
will
not
now
go
into
suffice
it
for
my
purpose
if
i
admit
that
mr
hardy
can
do
this
in
farmer
oak
there
is
nothing
to
object
to
the
conception
is
logical
the
execution
is
trustworthy
he
has
legs
arms
and
a
heart
but
the
vital
spark
that
should
make
him
of
our
flesh
and
of
our
soul
is
wanting
it
is
dead
water
that
the
sunlight
never
touches
the
heroine
is
still
more
dim
she
is
stuffy
she
is
like
tow
the
rich
farmer
is
a
figure
out
of
any
melodrama
sergeant
troy
nearly
quickens
to
life
now
and
then
the
clouds
are
liquescent
but
a
real
ray
of
light
never
falls
the
are
no
doubt
right
when
they
insist
on
the
difficulty
of
telling
a
story
a
sequence
of
events
it
does
not
matter
how
simple
or
how
complicated
working
up
to
a
logical
close
or
shall
i
say
a
close
in
which
there
is
a
sense
of
rhythm
and
inevitableness
is
always
indicative
of
genius
shakespeare
affords
some
magnificent
examples
likewise
balzac
likewise
george
eliot
likewise
tourgueneff
the
œdipus
is
of
course
the
crowning
and
final
achievement
in
the
music
of
sequence
and
the
massy
harmonies
of
fate
but
in
contemporary
english
fiction
i
marvel
and
i
am
repeatedly
struck
by
the
inability
of
writers
even
of
the
to
make
an
organic
whole
of
their
stories
here
i
say
the
course
is
clear
the
way
is
obvious
but
no
sooner
do
we
enter
on
the
last
chapters
than
the
story
begins
to
show
incipient
shiftiness
and
soon
it
doubles
back
and
turns
growing
with
every
turn
weaker
like
a
hare
before
the
hounds
from
a
certain
directness
of
construction
from
the
simple
means
by
which
oak
ruin
is
accomplished
in
the
opening
chapters
i
did
not
expect
that
the
story
would
run
in
its
close
but
the
moment
troy
told
his
wife
that
he
never
cared
for
her
i
suspected
something
was
wrong
when
he
went
down
to
bathe
and
was
carried
out
by
the
current
i
knew
the
game
was
up
and
was
prepared
for
anything
even
for
the
final
shooting
by
the
rich
farmer
and
the
marriage
with
oak
a
conclusion
which
of
course
does
not
come
within
the
range
of
literary
criticism
lorna
doone
struck
me
as
childishly
garrulous
stupidly
prolix
swollen
with
comments
not
interesting
in
themselves
and
leading
to
nothing
mr
hardy
possesses
the
power
of
being
able
to
shape
events
he
can
mould
them
to
a
certain
form
that
he
can
not
breathe
into
them
the
spirit
of
life
i
have
already
said
but
lorna
doone
reminds
me
of
a
italian
opera
fille
du
or
it
is
corrupt
with
all
the
vices
of
the
school
and
it
does
not
contain
a
single
passage
of
real
fervour
or
force
to
make
us
forget
the
inherent
defects
of
the
art
of
which
it
is
a
poor
specimen
wagner
made
the
discovery
not
a
very
wonderful
one
after
all
when
we
think
that
an
opera
had
much
better
be
melody
from
end
to
end
the
realistic
school
following
on
wagner
footsteps
discovered
that
a
novel
had
much
better
be
all
narrative
an
uninterrupted
flow
of
narrative
description
is
narrative
analysis
of
character
is
narrative
dialogue
is
narrative
the
form
is
ceaselessly
changing
but
the
melody
of
narration
is
never
interrupted
but
the
reading
of
lorna
doone
calls
to
my
mind
and
very
vividly
an
original
artistic
principle
of
which
english
romance
writers
are
either
strangely
ignorant
or
neglectful
that
the
sublimation
of
the
and
the
deeds
in
which
they
are
involved
must
correspond
and
their
relationship
should
remain
unimpaired
carthage
is
nature
transposed
and
wonderfully
modified
some
of
the
passages
of
light
and
shade
those
of
the
balustrade
are
fugues
and
there
his
art
is
allied
to
bach
in
sonority
and
beautiful
combination
turner
knew
that
a
branch
hung
across
the
sun
looked
at
separately
was
black
but
he
painted
it
light
to
maintain
the
equipoise
of
atmosphere
in
the
novel
the
characters
are
the
voice
the
deeds
are
the
orchestra
but
the
english
novelist
takes
and
and
without
question
allows
them
to
achieve
deeds
nor
does
he
hesitate
to
pass
them
into
the
realms
of
the
supernatural
such
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
narration
is
never
to
be
met
with
in
the
elder
writers
achilles
stands
as
tall
as
troy
merlin
is
as
old
and
as
wise
as
the
world
rhythm
and
poetical
expression
are
essential
attributes
of
dramatic
genius
but
the
original
sign
of
race
and
mission
is
an
instinctive
modulation
of
man
with
the
deeds
he
attempts
or
achieves
the
man
and
the
deed
must
be
cognate
and
equal
and
the
melodic
balance
and
blending
are
what
first
separate
homer
and
hugo
from
the
fabricators
of
singular
adventures
in
scott
leather
jerkins
swords
horses
mountains
and
castles
harmonise
completely
and
fully
with
food
fighting
words
and
vision
of
life
the
chords
are
simple
as
handel
but
they
are
as
perfect
lytton
work
although
as
vulgar
as
verdi
is
in
much
the
same
fashion
sustained
by
a
natural
sense
of
formal
harmony
but
all
that
follows
is
decadent
an
admixture
of
romance
and
realism
the
exaggerations
of
hugo
and
the
homeliness
of
trollope
a
litter
of
ancient
elements
in
a
state
of
decomposition
the
spiritual
analysis
of
balzac
equals
the
triumphant
imagination
of
shakespeare
and
by
different
roads
they
reach
the
same
height
of
tragic
awe
but
when
improbability
which
in
these
days
does
duty
for
imagination
is
mixed
with
the
familiar
aspects
of
life
the
result
is
inchoate
and
rhythmless
folly
i
mean
the
regular
and
inevitable
alternation
and
combination
of
pa
and
ma
and
dear
annie
who
lives
at
clapham
with
the
mountains
of
the
moon
and
the
secret
of
eternal
life
this
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
art
that
is
to
say
of
the
rhythm
of
feeling
and
proportion
is
not
possible
in
france
i
ask
the
reader
to
recall
what
was
said
on
the
subject
of
the
club
tavern
and
villa
we
have
a
surplus
population
of
more
than
two
million
women
the
tradition
that
chastity
is
woman
only
virtue
still
survives
the
tavern
and
its
adjunct
bohemianism
have
been
suppressed
and
the
villa
is
omnipotent
and
omnipresent
church
on
sundays
and
suburban
hops
engender
a
craving
for
excitement
for
the
far
away
for
the
unknown
but
the
villa
with
its
church
on
sundays
and
suburban
hops
will
not
surrender
its
own
existence
it
must
take
a
part
in
the
heroic
deeds
that
happen
in
the
mountains
of
the
moon
it
will
have
heroism
in
its
own
pint
pot
achilles
and
merlin
must
be
replaced
by
uncle
jim
and
an
undergraduate
and
so
the
villa
is
the
only
begotten
of
rider
haggard
hugh
conway
robert
buchanan
and
the
author
of
the
house
on
the
marsh
i
read
two
books
by
mr
christie
murray
joseph
coat
and
rainbow
gold
and
one
by
messrs
besant
and
rice
the
seamy
side
it
is
difficult
to
criticise
such
work
it
is
as
suited
to
the
needs
of
the
villa
as
the
baker
loaves
and
the
butcher
rounds
of
beef
i
do
not
think
that
any
such
miserable
literature
is
found
in
any
other
country
in
france
some
three
or
four
men
produce
works
of
art
the
rest
of
the
fiction
of
the
country
is
unknown
to
men
of
letters
but
rainbow
gold
to
take
the
best
of
the
three
is
not
bad
as
a
french
novel
is
bad
it
is
excellent
as
all
that
is
straightforward
is
excellent
and
it
is
surprising
to
find
that
work
can
be
so
good
and
at
the
same
time
so
devoid
of
artistic
charm
that
such
a
thing
should
be
is
one
of
the
miracles
of
the
villa
i
have
heard
that
mr
besant
is
an
artist
in
the
chaplain
of
the
fleet
and
other
novels
but
this
is
not
possible
the
artist
shows
what
he
is
going
to
do
the
moment
he
puts
pen
to
paper
or
brush
to
canvas
he
improves
on
his
first
attempts
that
is
all
and
i
found
the
seamy
side
so
very
common
that
i
can
not
believe
for
a
moment
that
its
author
or
authors
could
write
a
line
that
would
interest
me
mr
robert
buchanan
is
a
type
of
artist
that
every
age
produces
unfailingly
catulle
mendès
is
his
counterpart
in
france
but
the
pallid
portuguese
jew
with
his
face
and
his
fascinating
fervour
is
more
interesting
than
the
spectacled
scotchman
both
began
with
volumes
of
excellent
but
characterless
verse
and
loud
outcries
about
the
dignity
of
art
and
both
have
well
mr
robert
buchanan
has
collaborated
with
gus
harris
and
written
the
programme
poetry
for
the
vaudeville
theatre
he
has
written
a
novel
the
less
said
about
which
the
better
he
has
attacked
men
whose
he
is
unworthy
to
tie
and
having
failed
to
injure
them
he
retracted
all
he
said
and
launched
forth
into
slimy
benedictions
he
took
fielding
masterpiece
degraded
it
and
debased
it
he
wrote
to
the
papers
that
fielding
was
a
genius
in
spite
of
his
coarseness
thereby
inferring
that
he
was
a
much
greater
genius
since
he
had
sojourned
in
this
scotch
house
of
literary
clarville
the
author
of
madame
angot
transformed
madame
marneff
into
a
virtuous
woman
but
he
did
not
write
to
the
papers
to
say
that
balzac
owed
him
a
debt
of
gratitude
on
that
account
the
star
of
miss
braddon
has
finally
set
in
the
obscure
regions
of
servantgalism
ouida
and
rhoda
broughton
continue
to
rewrite
the
books
they
wrote
ten
years
ago
mrs
lynn
linton
i
have
not
read
the
story
of
an
african
farm
was
pressed
upon
me
i
found
it
sincere
and
youthful
disjointed
but
descriptions
of
sandhills
and
ostriches
sandwiched
with
doubts
concerning
a
future
state
and
convictions
regarding
the
moral
and
physical
superiority
of
women
but
of
art
nothing
that
is
to
say
art
as
i
understand
it
rhythmical
sequence
of
events
described
with
rhythmical
sequence
of
phrase
i
read
the
story
of
elizabeth
by
miss
thackeray
it
came
upon
me
with
all
the
fresh
and
fair
naturalness
of
a
garden
full
of
lilacs
and
blue
sky
and
i
thought
of
hardy
blackmore
murray
and
besant
as
of
great
warehouses
where
everything
might
be
had
and
even
if
the
article
required
were
not
in
stock
it
could
be
supplied
in
a
few
days
at
latest
these
are
exquisite
little
descriptions
full
of
air
colour
lightness
grace
the
french
life
seen
with
such
sweet
english
eyes
the
sweet
little
descriptions
all
so
gently
evocative
what
a
tranquil
little
kitchen
it
was
with
a
glimpse
of
the
courtyard
outside
and
the
cocks
and
hens
and
the
poplar
trees
waving
in
the
sunshine
and
the
old
woman
sitting
in
her
white
cap
busy
at
her
homely
work
into
many
wearisome
pages
these
simple
lines
have
since
been
expanded
without
affecting
the
beauty
of
the
original
will
dampier
turned
his
broad
back
and
looked
out
of
the
window
there
was
a
moment
silence
they
could
hear
the
tinkling
of
bells
the
whistling
of
the
sea
the
voices
of
the
men
calling
to
each
other
in
the
port
the
sunshine
streamed
in
elly
was
standing
in
it
and
seemed
gilt
with
a
golden
background
she
ought
to
have
held
a
palm
in
her
hand
poor
little
martyr
there
is
sweet
wisdom
in
this
book
wisdom
that
is
eternal
being
simple
near
may
not
come
the
ugliness
of
positivism
nor
the
horror
of
pessimism
nor
the
profound
greyness
of
hegelism
but
merely
the
genial
love
and
reverence
of
a
woman
such
charms
as
these
necessitate
certain
defects
i
should
say
limitations
vital
creation
of
character
is
not
possible
to
miss
thackeray
but
i
do
not
rail
against
beautiful
indications
of
balconies
vases
gardens
fields
and
harvesters
because
they
have
not
the
fervid
glow
and
passionate
force
of
titian
ariadne
miss
thackeray
can
not
give
us
a
maggie
tulliver
and
all
the
many
profound
modulations
of
that
countryside
the
pine
wood
and
the
cripple
this
aunt
linen
presses
and
that
one
economies
the
boy
going
forth
to
conquer
the
world
the
girl
remaining
at
home
to
conquer
herself
the
mighty
river
holding
the
fate
of
all
playing
and
dallying
with
it
for
a
while
and
bearing
it
on
at
last
to
final
and
magnificent
extinction
that
sense
of
the
inevitable
which
the
greek
dramatists
had
in
perfection
which
george
eliot
had
sufficiently
that
rhythmical
progression
of
events
rhythm
and
inevitableness
two
words
for
one
and
the
same
thing
is
not
there
elly
golden
head
the
background
of
austere
french
protestants
is
sketched
with
a
flowing
brush
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
true
but
true
or
false
in
reality
it
is
true
in
art
but
the
jarring
dissonance
of
her
marriage
is
inadmissible
it
can
not
be
led
up
to
by
any
chords
no
matter
how
ingenious
the
passage
the
attempts
from
one
key
to
the
other
is
impossible
the
true
end
is
the
ruin
by
death
or
lingering
life
of
elly
and
the
remorse
of
the
mother
one
of
the
few
writers
of
fiction
who
seems
to
me
to
possess
an
ear
for
the
music
of
events
is
miss
margaret
veley
her
first
novel
for
percival
although
diffuse
although
it
occasionally
flowed
into
and
lingered
in
stagnating
pools
was
informed
and
held
together
even
at
ends
the
most
twisted
and
broken
by
that
sense
of
rhythmic
progression
which
is
so
dear
to
me
and
which
was
afterwards
so
splendidly
developed
in
damocles
pale
painted
with
grey
and
opaline
tints
of
morning
passes
the
grand
figure
of
rachel
conway
a
victim
chosen
for
her
beauty
and
crowned
with
flowers
of
sacrifice
she
has
not
forgotten
the
face
of
the
maniac
and
it
comes
back
to
her
in
its
awful
lines
and
lights
when
she
finds
herself
rich
and
loved
by
the
man
whom
she
loves
the
catastrophe
is
a
double
one
now
she
knows
she
is
accursed
and
that
her
duty
is
to
trample
out
her
love
unborn
generations
cry
to
her
the
wrath
and
the
lamentation
of
the
chorus
of
the
greek
singer
the
intoning
voices
of
the
the
pathetic
responses
of
voices
far
in
the
depths
of
night
these
the
modern
novelist
playing
on
an
inferior
instrument
may
suggest
but
can
not
give
but
here
the
suggestion
is
so
perfect
that
we
cease
to
yearn
for
the
real
music
as
reading
from
a
score
we
are
satisfied
with
the
flute
and
bassoons
that
play
so
faultlessly
in
soundless
dots
there
is
neither
hesitation
nor
doubt
rachel
conway
puts
her
dreams
away
she
will
henceforth
walk
in
a
sad
and
shady
path
her
interests
are
centred
in
the
child
of
the
man
she
loves
and
as
she
looks
for
a
last
time
on
the
cloud
of
trees
glorious
and
waving
green
in
the
sunset
that
encircles
her
home
her
sorrow
swells
once
again
to
passion
and
we
know
for
the
last
time
the
mechanical
construction
of
scribe
i
had
learnt
from
duval
the
naturalistic
school
had
taught
me
to
scorn
tricks
and
to
rely
on
the
action
of
the
sentiments
rather
than
on
extraneous
aid
for
the
bringing
about
of
a
and
i
thought
of
all
this
as
i
read
disenchantment
by
miss
mabel
robinson
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
my
knowledge
would
prove
valuable
when
my
turn
came
to
write
a
novel
for
the
en
the
setting
forth
of
this
story
seemed
to
me
so
loose
that
much
of
its
strength
had
dribbled
away
before
it
had
rightly
begun
but
the
figure
of
the
irish
politician
i
accept
without
reserve
it
seems
to
me
grand
and
mighty
in
its
sorrowfulness
the
tall
beautiful
celt
attainted
in
blood
and
brain
by
generations
of
famine
and
drink
alternating
with
the
fervid
sensuousness
of
the
girl
her
saxon
sense
of
right
alternating
with
the
celt
hereditary
sense
of
revenge
his
dreamy
patriotism
his
facile
platitudes
his
acceptance
of
literature
as
a
sort
of
bread
basket
his
knowledge
that
he
is
not
great
nor
strong
and
can
do
nothing
in
the
world
but
love
his
country
and
as
he
passes
his
thirtieth
year
the
waxing
strong
of
the
disease
nervous
disease
complex
and
torturous
to
him
drink
is
at
once
life
and
death
an
article
is
bread
and
to
calm
him
and
collect
what
remains
of
weak
scattered
thought
he
must
drink
the
woman
can
not
understand
that
caste
and
race
separate
them
and
the
damp
air
of
spent
desire
and
the
grey
and
falling
leaves
of
her
illusions
fill
her
sky
nor
is
there
any
hope
for
her
until
the
husband
unties
the
awful
knot
by
suicide
i
aver
that
mr
stevenson
never
wrote
a
line
that
failed
to
delight
me
but
he
never
wrote
a
book
you
arrive
at
a
strangely
just
estimate
of
a
writer
worth
by
the
mere
question
what
is
he
the
author
of
for
every
writer
whose
work
is
destined
to
live
is
the
author
of
one
book
that
outshines
the
other
and
in
popular
imagination
epitomises
his
talent
and
position
ask
the
same
question
about
milton
fielding
byron
carlyle
thackeray
zola
mr
swinburne
i
think
of
mr
stevenson
as
a
consumptive
youth
weaving
garlands
of
sad
flowers
with
pale
weak
hands
or
leaning
to
a
large
window
and
scratching
thereon
exquisite
profiles
with
a
diamond
pencil
his
periods
are
fresh
and
bright
rhythmical
in
sound
and
perfect
realizations
of
their
sense
in
reading
you
often
think
that
never
before
was
such
definiteness
united
to
such
poetry
of
expression
every
page
and
every
sentence
rings
of
its
individuality
mr
stevenson
style
is
shall
i
say
like
a
young
man
walking
in
the
burlington
arcade
yes
i
will
say
so
but
i
will
add
the
most
gentlemanly
young
man
that
ever
walked
in
the
burlington
mr
stevenson
is
competent
to
understand
any
thought
that
might
be
presented
to
him
but
if
he
were
to
use
it
it
would
instantly
become
neat
sharp
ornamental
light
and
graceful
and
it
would
lose
all
its
original
richness
and
harmony
it
is
not
mr
stevenson
brain
that
prevents
him
from
being
a
thinker
but
his
style
another
thing
that
strikes
me
in
thinking
of
stevenson
i
pass
over
his
direct
indebtedness
to
edgar
poe
and
his
constant
appropriation
of
his
methods
is
the
unsuitableness
of
the
special
characteristics
of
his
talent
to
the
age
he
lives
in
he
wastes
in
his
limitations
and
his
talent
is
vented
in
prettiness
of
style
in
speaking
of
mr
henry
james
i
said
that
although
he
had
conceded
much
to
the
foolish
false
and
hypocritical
taste
of
the
time
the
concessions
he
made
had
in
little
or
nothing
impaired
his
talent
the
very
opposite
seems
to
me
the
case
with
mr
stevenson
for
if
any
man
living
in
this
end
of
the
century
needed
freedom
of
expression
for
the
distinct
development
of
his
genius
that
man
is
stevenson
he
who
runs
may
read
and
he
with
any
knowledge
of
literature
will
before
i
have
written
the
words
have
imagined
mr
stevenson
writing
in
the
age
of
elizabeth
or
anne
turn
your
platitudes
prettily
but
write
no
word
that
could
offend
the
chaste
mind
of
the
young
girl
who
has
spent
her
morning
reading
the
colin
campbell
divorce
case
so
says
the
age
we
live
in
the
penny
paper
that
may
be
bought
everywhere
that
is
allowed
to
lie
on
every
table
prints
seven
or
eight
columns
of
filth
for
no
reason
except
that
the
public
likes
to
read
filth
the
poet
and
novelist
must
emasculate
and
destroy
their
work
because
who
shall
come
forward
and
make
answer
oh
vile
filthy
and
hypocritical
century
i
at
least
scorn
you
but
this
is
not
a
course
of
literature
but
the
story
of
the
artistic
development
of
me
george
moore
so
i
will
tarry
no
longer
with
mere
criticism
but
go
direct
to
the
book
to
which
i
owe
the
last
temple
in
my
soul
marius
the
epicurean
well
i
remember
when
i
read
the
opening
lines
and
how
they
came
upon
me
sweetly
as
the
flowing
breath
of
a
bright
spring
i
knew
that
i
was
awakened
a
fourth
time
that
a
fourth
vision
of
life
was
to
be
given
to
me
shelley
had
revealed
to
me
the
unimagined
skies
where
the
spirit
sings
of
light
and
grace
gautier
had
shown
me
how
extravagantly
beautiful
is
the
visible
world
and
how
divine
is
the
rage
of
the
flesh
and
with
balzac
i
had
descended
circle
by
circle
into
the
nether
world
of
the
soul
and
watched
its
afflictions
then
there
were
minor
awakenings
zola
had
enchanted
me
with
decoration
and
inebriated
me
with
theory
flaubert
had
astonished
with
the
wonderful
delicacy
and
subtlety
of
his
workmanship
brilliant
adjectival
effects
had
captivated
me
for
a
time
but
all
these
impulses
were
crumbling
into
dust
these
aspirations
were
etiolated
sickly
as
faces
grown
old
in
gaslight
i
had
not
thought
of
the
simple
and
unaffected
joy
of
the
heart
of
natural
things
the
colour
of
the
open
air
the
many
forms
of
the
country
the
birds
flying
that
one
making
for
the
sea
the
abandoned
boat
the
dwarf
roses
and
the
wild
lavender
nor
had
i
thought
of
the
beauty
of
mildness
in
life
and
how
by
a
certain
avoidance
of
the
wilfully
passionate
and
the
surely
ugly
we
may
secure
an
aspect
of
temporal
life
which
is
abiding
and
a
new
dawn
was
in
my
brain
fresh
and
fair
full
of
wide
temples
and
studious
hours
and
the
lurking
fragrance
of
incense
that
such
a
vision
of
life
was
possible
i
had
no
suspicion
and
it
came
upon
me
almost
with
the
same
strength
almost
as
intensely
as
that
divine
song
of
the
flesh
mademoiselle
de
maupin
certainly
in
my
mind
these
books
will
be
always
intimately
associated
and
when
a
few
adventitious
points
of
difference
be
forgotten
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
firm
is
the
alliance
and
how
cognate
and
the
sympathies
on
which
it
is
based
the
same
glad
worship
of
the
visible
world
and
the
same
incurable
belief
that
the
beauty
of
material
things
is
sufficient
for
all
the
needs
of
life
mr
pater
can
join
hands
with
gautier
in
saying
trouve
la
terre
aussi
belle
que
le
ciel
et
je
pense
que
la
correction
de
la
forme
est
la
and
i
too
join
issue
i
too
love
the
great
pagan
world
its
bloodshed
its
slaves
its
injustice
its
loathing
of
all
that
is
feeble
but
marius
the
epicurean
was
more
to
me
than
a
mere
emotional
influence
precious
and
rare
though
that
may
be
for
this
book
was
the
first
in
english
prose
i
had
come
across
that
procured
for
me
any
genuine
pleasure
in
the
language
itself
in
the
combination
of
words
for
silver
or
gold
chime
and
unconventional
cadence
and
for
all
those
lurking
and
that
evanescent
suggestion
like
the
odour
of
dead
roses
that
words
retain
to
the
last
of
other
times
and
elder
usage
until
i
read
marius
the
english
language
english
prose
was
to
me
what
french
must
be
to
the
majority
of
english
readers
i
read
for
the
sense
and
that
was
all
the
language
itself
seemed
to
me
coarse
and
plain
and
awoke
in
me
neither
æsthetic
emotion
nor
even
interest
marius
was
the
that
carried
me
across
the
channel
into
the
genius
of
my
own
tongue
the
translation
was
not
too
abrupt
i
found
a
constant
and
careful
invocation
of
meaning
that
was
a
little
aside
of
the
common
comprehension
and
also
a
sweet
depravity
of
ear
for
unexpected
falls
of
phrase
and
of
eye
for
the
less
observed
depths
of
colours
which
although
new
was
a
sort
of
sequel
to
the
education
i
had
chosen
and
a
continuance
of
it
in
a
foreign
but
not
wholly
unfamiliar
medium
and
so
having
saturated
myself
with
pater
the
passage
to
de
quincey
was
easy
he
too
was
a
latin
in
manner
and
in
temper
of
mind
but
he
was
truly
english
and
through
him
i
passed
to
the
study
of
the
elizabethan
dramatists
the
real
literature
of
my
race
and
washed
myself
clean
xiii
thoughts
in
a
strand
lodging
awful
emma
has
undressed
and
put
the
last
child
away
stowed
the
last
child
away
in
some
mysterious
and
unapproachable
corner
that
none
knows
of
but
she
the
fat
landlady
has
ceased
to
loiter
about
my
door
has
ceased
to
tempt
me
with
offers
of
brandy
and
water
tea
and
toast
the
inducements
that
occur
to
her
landlady
mind
the
actress
from
the
savoy
has
ceased
to
walk
up
and
down
the
street
with
the
young
man
who
accompanies
her
home
from
the
theatre
she
has
ceased
to
linger
on
the
doorstep
talking
to
him
her
key
has
grated
in
the
lock
she
has
come
upstairs
we
have
had
our
usual
midnight
conversation
on
the
landing
she
has
told
me
her
latest
hopes
of
obtaining
a
part
she
has
told
me
of
the
husband
whom
she
was
obliged
to
leave
we
have
bidden
each
other
she
has
gone
up
the
creaky
staircase
and
i
have
returned
to
my
room
littered
with
and
queer
publications
the
night
is
hot
and
heavy
but
now
a
wind
is
blowing
from
the
river
and
listless
and
lonely
i
open
a
book
the
first
book
that
comes
to
hand
it
is
journal
des
goncourts
the
end
of
a
chapter
is
really
curious
that
it
should
be
the
four
men
the
most
free
from
all
taint
of
handicraft
and
all
base
commercialism
the
four
pens
the
most
entirely
devoted
to
art
that
were
arraigned
before
the
public
prosecutor
baudelaire
flaubert
and
goncourt
statement
is
suggestive
and
i
leave
it
uncommented
on
but
i
would
put
by
its
side
another
naked
simple
truth
that
if
in
england
the
public
prosecutor
does
not
seek
to
literature
the
means
of
tyranny
are
not
wanting
whether
they
be
the
of
the
nursery
or
the
lady
or
the
shameless
combinations
entered
into
by
librarians
in
england
as
in
france
those
who
loved
literature
the
most
purely
who
were
the
least
mercenary
in
their
love
were
marked
out
for
persecution
and
all
three
were
driven
into
exile
byron
and
shelley
and
swinburne
he
too
who
loved
literature
for
its
own
sake
was
forced
amid
cries
of
indignation
and
horror
to
withdraw
his
book
from
the
reach
of
a
public
that
was
rooting
then
amid
the
garbage
of
the
yelverton
divorce
case
i
think
of
these
facts
and
think
of
baudelaire
prose
poem
that
poem
in
which
he
tells
how
a
dog
will
run
away
howling
if
you
hold
to
him
a
bottle
of
choice
scent
but
if
you
offer
him
some
putrid
morsel
picked
out
of
some
gutter
hole
he
will
sniff
round
it
joyfully
and
will
seek
to
lick
your
hand
for
gratitude
baudelaire
compared
that
dog
to
the
public
when
i
read
balzac
stories
of
vautrin
and
lucien
de
rubempré
i
often
think
of
hadrian
and
the
antinous
i
wonder
if
balzac
thought
of
transposing
the
roman
emperor
and
his
favourite
into
modern
life
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
balzac
would
think
of
no
critic
has
ever
noticed
this
sometimes
at
night
when
all
is
still
and
i
look
out
on
that
desolate
river
i
think
i
shall
go
mad
with
grief
with
wild
regret
for
my
beautiful
in
de
la
tour
des
how
different
the
present
from
the
past
i
hate
with
my
whole
soul
this
london
lodging
and
all
that
concerns
it
emma
and
eggs
and
bacon
the
lascivious
landlady
and
her
lascivious
daughter
i
am
weary
of
the
sentimental
actress
who
lives
upstairs
i
swear
i
will
never
go
out
to
talk
to
her
on
the
landing
again
then
there
is
failure
i
can
do
nothing
nothing
my
novel
i
know
is
worthless
my
life
is
a
leaf
it
will
flutter
out
of
sight
i
am
weary
of
everything
and
wish
i
were
back
in
paris
i
am
weary
of
reading
there
is
nothing
to
read
flaubert
bores
me
what
nonsense
has
been
talked
about
him
impersonal
he
is
the
most
personal
writer
but
his
odious
pessimism
how
weary
i
am
of
it
it
never
ceases
it
is
lugged
in
tout
and
the
little
lyrical
phrase
with
which
he
winds
up
every
paragraph
how
boring
it
is
happily
i
have
a
rebours
to
read
that
prodigious
book
that
beautiful
mosaic
huysmans
is
quite
right
ideas
are
well
enough
until
you
are
twenty
afterwards
only
words
are
bearable
a
new
idea
what
can
be
more
insipid
fit
for
members
of
parliament
shall
i
go
to
bed
no
i
wish
i
had
a
volume
of
verlaine
or
something
of
mallarmé
to
read
mallarmé
for
preference
i
remember
huysmans
speaks
of
mallarmé
in
a
rebours
in
hours
like
these
a
page
of
huysmans
is
as
a
dose
of
opium
a
glass
of
something
exquisite
and
spirituous
the
decadence
of
a
literature
irreparably
attacked
in
its
organism
weakened
by
the
age
of
ideas
overworn
by
the
excess
of
syntax
sensible
only
of
the
curiosity
which
fevers
sick
people
but
nevertheless
hastening
to
explain
everything
in
its
decline
desirous
of
repairing
all
the
omissions
of
its
youth
to
bequeath
all
the
most
subtle
souvenirs
of
its
suffering
on
its
deathbed
is
incarnate
in
mallarmé
in
most
consummate
and
absolute
fashion
the
poem
in
prose
is
the
form
above
all
others
they
prefer
handled
by
an
alchemist
of
genius
it
should
contain
in
a
state
of
meat
the
entire
strength
of
the
novel
the
long
analysis
and
the
superfluous
description
of
which
it
suppresses
the
adjective
placed
in
such
an
ingenious
and
definite
way
that
it
could
not
be
legally
dispossessed
of
its
place
would
open
up
such
perspectives
that
the
reader
would
dream
for
whole
weeks
together
on
its
meaning
at
once
precise
and
multiple
affirm
the
present
reconstruct
the
past
divine
the
future
of
the
souls
of
the
characters
revealed
by
the
light
of
the
unique
epithet
the
novel
thus
understood
thus
condensed
into
one
or
two
pages
would
be
a
communion
of
thought
between
a
magical
writer
and
an
ideal
reader
a
spiritual
collaboration
by
consent
between
ten
superior
persons
scattered
through
the
universe
a
delectation
offered
to
the
most
refined
and
accessible
only
to
them
huysmans
goes
to
my
soul
like
a
gold
ornament
of
byzantine
workmanship
there
is
in
his
style
the
yearning
charm
of
arches
a
sense
of
ritual
the
passion
of
the
gothic
of
the
window
ah
in
this
hour
of
weariness
for
one
of
mallarmé
prose
poems
stay
i
remember
i
have
some
numbers
of
one
of
the
numbers
contains
i
know
forgotten
pages
i
will
translate
word
for
word
preserving
the
very
rhythm
one
or
two
of
these
miniature
marvels
of
diction
i
forgotten
pages
since
maria
left
me
to
go
to
another
star
which
orion
altair
or
thou
green
venus
i
have
always
cherished
solitude
what
long
days
i
have
passed
alone
with
my
cat
by
alone
i
mean
without
a
material
being
and
my
cat
is
a
mystical
companion
a
spirit
i
can
therefore
say
that
i
have
passed
whole
days
alone
with
my
cat
and
alone
with
one
of
the
last
authors
of
the
latin
decadence
for
since
that
white
creature
is
no
more
strangely
and
singularly
i
have
loved
all
that
the
word
expresses
in
such
wise
that
my
favourite
season
of
the
year
is
the
last
weary
days
of
summer
which
immediately
precede
autumn
and
the
hour
i
choose
to
walk
in
is
when
the
sun
rests
before
disappearing
with
rays
of
yellow
copper
on
the
grey
walls
and
red
copper
on
the
tiles
in
the
same
way
the
literature
that
my
soul
demands
a
sad
voluptuousness
is
the
dying
poetry
of
the
last
moments
of
rome
but
before
it
has
breathed
at
all
the
rejuvenating
approach
of
the
barbarians
or
has
begun
to
stammer
the
infantile
latin
of
the
first
christian
poetry
i
was
reading
therefore
one
of
those
dear
poems
whose
paint
has
more
charm
for
me
than
the
blush
of
youth
had
plunged
one
hand
into
the
fur
of
the
pure
animal
when
a
sang
languidly
and
melancholy
beneath
my
window
it
played
in
the
great
alley
of
poplars
whose
leaves
appear
to
me
yellow
even
in
the
since
maria
passed
there
with
the
tall
candles
for
the
last
time
the
instrument
is
the
saddest
yes
truly
the
piano
scintillates
the
violin
opens
the
torn
soul
to
the
light
but
the
in
the
twilight
of
remembrance
made
me
dream
despairingly
now
it
murmurs
an
air
joyously
vulgar
which
awakens
joy
in
the
heart
of
the
suburbs
an
air
and
commonplace
why
do
its
flourishes
go
to
my
soul
and
make
me
weep
like
a
romantic
ballad
i
listen
imbibing
it
slowly
and
i
do
not
throw
a
penny
out
of
the
window
for
fear
of
moving
from
my
place
and
seeing
that
the
instrument
is
not
singing
itself
ii
the
old
saxony
clock
which
is
slow
and
which
strikes
thirteen
amid
its
flowers
and
gods
to
whom
did
it
belong
thinkest
that
it
came
from
saxony
by
the
mail
coaches
of
old
time
singular
shadows
hang
about
the
panes
and
thy
venetian
mirror
deep
as
a
cold
fountain
in
its
banks
of
gilt
work
what
is
reflected
there
ah
i
am
sure
that
more
than
one
woman
bathed
there
in
her
beauty
sin
and
perhaps
if
i
looked
long
enough
i
should
see
a
naked
phantom
wicked
one
thou
often
sayest
wicked
things
i
see
the
spiders
webs
above
the
lofty
windows
our
wardrobe
is
very
old
see
how
the
fire
reddens
its
sad
panels
the
weary
curtains
are
as
old
and
the
tapestry
on
the
stripped
of
paint
and
the
old
engravings
and
all
these
old
things
does
it
not
seem
to
thee
that
even
these
blue
birds
are
discoloured
by
time
dream
not
of
the
spiders
webs
that
tremble
above
the
lofty
windows
thou
lovest
all
that
and
that
is
why
i
live
by
thee
when
one
of
my
poems
appeared
didst
thou
not
desire
my
sister
whose
looks
are
full
of
yesterdays
the
words
the
grace
of
faded
things
new
objects
displease
thee
thee
also
do
they
frighten
with
their
loud
boldness
and
thou
feelest
as
if
thou
shouldst
use
them
a
difficult
thing
indeed
to
do
for
thou
hast
no
taste
for
action
come
close
thy
old
german
almanack
that
thou
readest
with
attention
though
it
appeared
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
and
the
kings
it
announces
are
all
dead
and
lying
on
this
antique
carpet
my
head
leaned
upon
thy
charitable
knees
on
the
pale
robe
oh
calm
child
i
will
speak
with
thee
for
hours
there
are
no
fields
and
the
streets
are
empty
i
will
speak
to
thee
of
our
furniture
thou
art
abstracted
the
spiders
webs
are
shivering
above
the
lofty
windows
we
the
ten
superior
persons
scattered
through
the
universe
think
these
prose
poems
the
concrete
essence
the
osmazome
of
literature
the
essential
oil
of
art
others
those
in
the
stalls
will
judge
them
to
be
the
aberrations
of
a
refined
mind
distorted
with
hatred
of
the
commonplace
the
pit
will
immediately
declare
them
to
be
nonsense
and
will
return
with
satisfaction
to
the
last
leading
article
in
the
daily
paper

absurdities

amused
us
many
a
year
in
france
and
in
later
days
similar
bad
grammar
by
georges
ohnet
has
not
been
lost
upon
us
but
neither
ponson
du
terrail
nor
georges
ohnet
sought
literary
suffrage
such
a
thing
could
not
be
in
france
but
in
england
rider
haggard
whose
literary
atrocities
are
more
atrocious
than
his
accounts
of
slaughter
receives
the
attention
of
leading
journals
and
writes
about
the
revival
of
romance
as
it
is
as
difficult
to
write
the
worst
as
the
best
conceivable
sentence
i
take
this
one
and
place
it
for
its
greater
glory
in
my
less
remarkable
prose
we
gazed
on
the
beauties
thus
revealed
by
good
a
spirit
of
emulation
filled
our
breasts
and
we
set
to
work
to
get
ourselves
up
as
well
as
we
a
return
to
romance
a
return
to
the
animal
say
i
one
thing
that
can
not
be
denied
to
the
realists
a
constant
and
intense
desire
to
write
well
to
write
artistically
when
i
think
of
what
they
have
done
in
the
matter
of
the
use
of
words
of
the
myriad
verbal
effects
they
have
discovered
of
the
thousand
forms
of
composition
they
have
created
how
they
have
remodelled
and
refashioned
the
language
in
their
untiring
striving
for
intensity
of
expression
for
the
very
osmazome
of
art
i
am
lost
in
ultimate
wonder
and
admiration
what
hugo
did
for
french
verse
flaubert
goncourt
zola
and
huysmans
have
done
for
french
prose
no
more
literary
school
than
the
realists
has
ever
existed
and
i
do
not
except
even
the
elizabethans
and
for
this
reason
our
failures
are
more
interesting
than
the
vulgar
successes
of
our
opponents
for
when
we
fall
into
the
sterile
and
distorted
it
is
through
our
noble
and
incurable
hatred
of
the
commonplace
of
all
that
is
popular
the
healthy
school
is
played
out
in
england
all
that
could
be
said
has
been
said
the
successors
of
dickens
thackeray
and
george
eliot
have
no
ideal
and
consequently
no
language
what
can
be
more
pudding
than
the
language
of
mr
hardy
and
he
is
typical
of
a
dozen
other
writers
mr
besant
mr
murray
mr
crawford
the
reason
of
this
heaviness
of
thought
and
expression
is
that
the
avenues
are
closed
no
new
subject
matter
is
introduced
the
language
of
english
fiction
has
therefore
run
stagnant
but
if
the
realists
should
catch
favour
in
england
the
english
tongue
may
be
saved
from
dissolution
for
with
the
new
subjects
they
would
introduce
new
forms
of
language
would
arise
carmen
sylva
how
easy
it
is
to
divine
the
æstheticism
of
any
one
signing
carmen
sylva
in
youth
the
genius
of
shelly
astonished
me
but
now
i
find
the
stupidity
of
the
ordinary
person
infinitely
more
surprising
that
i
may
die
childless
that
when
my
hour
comes
i
may
turn
my
face
to
the
wall
saying
i
have
not
increased
the
great
evil
of
human
life
then
though
i
were
murderer
fornicator
thief
and
liar
my
sins
shall
melt
even
as
a
cloud
but
he
who
dies
with
children
about
him
though
his
life
were
in
all
else
an
excellent
deed
shall
be
held
accursed
by
the
truly
wise
and
the
stain
upon
him
shall
endure
for
ever
i
realize
that
this
is
truth
the
one
truth
and
the
whole
truth
and
yet
the
vainest
woman
that
ever
looked
in
a
glass
never
regretted
her
youth
more
than
i
or
felt
the
disgrace
of
more
keenly
she
has
her
portrait
painted
i
write
these
confessions
each
hopes
to
save
something
of
the
past
and
escape
somehow
the
ravening
waves
of
time
and
float
into
some
haven
of
remembrance
st
augustine
confessions
are
the
story
of
a
mine
of
an
soul
which
subject
is
the
most
living
the
first
for
man
is
stupid
and
still
loves
his
conscience
as
a
child
loves
a
toy
now
the
world
plays
with
robert
elsmere
this
book
seems
to
me
like
a
suite
of
spacious
well
distributed
and
well
proportioned
rooms
looking
round
i
say
is
a
pity
these
rooms
are
only
in
plaster
of
paris
les
palais
nomades
is
a
really
beautiful
book
and
it
is
free
from
all
the
faults
that
make
an
absolute
and
supreme
enjoyment
of
great
poetry
an
impossibility
for
it
is
in
the
first
place
free
from
those
pests
and
parasites
of
artistic
work
ideas
of
all
literary
qualities
the
creation
of
ideas
is
the
most
fugitive
think
of
the
fate
of
an
author
who
puts
forward
a
new
idea
in
a
book
in
a
play
in
a
poem
the
new
idea
is
seized
upon
it
becomes
common
property
it
is
dragged
through
newspaper
articles
magazine
articles
through
books
it
is
repeated
in
clubs
it
is
bandied
about
the
corners
of
streets
in
a
week
it
is
wearisome
in
a
month
it
is
an
abomination
who
has
not
felt
a
sickening
feeling
come
over
him
when
he
hears
such
phrases
as
to
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question
shakespeare
was
really
great
when
he
wrote
music
to
hear
why
hearest
thou
music
sadly
not
when
he
wrote
the
apparel
oft
proclaims
the
man
could
he
be
freed
from
his
ideas
what
a
poet
we
should
have
therefore
let
those
who
have
taken
firsts
at
oxford
devote
their
intolerable
leisure
to
preparing
an
edition
from
which
everything
resembling
an
idea
shall
be
excluded
we
might
then
shut
up
our
marlowes
and
our
beaumonts
and
resume
our
reading
of
the
bard
and
the
witless
foists
would
confer
happiness
on
many
and
crown
themselves
with
truly
immortal
bays
see
the
fellows
their
fingers
catch
at
scanty
wisps
of
hair
the
lamps
are
burning
the
long
pens
are
poised
and
idea
after
idea
is
hurled
out
of
existence
gustave
kahn
took
counsel
of
the
past
and
he
has
successfully
avoided
everything
that
even
a
hostile
critic
might
be
tempted
to
term
an
idea
and
for
this
i
am
grateful
nor
is
his
volume
a
collection
of
miscellaneous
verses
bound
together
he
has
chosen
a
certain
sequence
of
emotions
the
circumstances
out
of
which
these
emotions
have
sprung
are
given
in
a
short
prose
note
les
palais
nomades
is
therefore
a
novel
in
essence
description
and
analysis
are
eliminated
and
only
the
moments
when
life
grows
lyrical
with
suffering
are
recorded
recorded
in
many
varying
metres
conforming
only
to
the
play
of
the
emotion
for
unlike
many
who
having
once
discovered
a
tune
apply
it
promiscuously
to
every
subject
they
treat
kahn
adapts
his
melody
to
the
emotion
he
is
expressing
with
the
same
propriety
and
grace
as
nature
distributes
perfume
to
her
flowers
for
an
example
of
magical
transition

tone

the

as

break

to
the

with
literature
who
cares

gustave

i
met
a
chappie
yesterday
whose
views
of
life
coincide
with
mine
a
ripping
good
dinner
he
says

a
skinful
of
champagne
inside
you
go
to
bed
when
it
is
light
and
get
up
when
you
are
rested
each
century
has
its
special
ideal
the
ideal
of
the
nineteenth
is
the
young
man
the
eighteenth
century
is
only
woman
see
the
tapestries
the
delightful
goddesses
who
have
discarded
their
hoops
and
heels
to
appear
in
still
more
delightful
nakedness
the
noble
woods
the
tall
castles
with
the
hunters
looking
round
no
servile
archæology
chills
the
fancy
and
this
treatment
of
antiquity
is
the
highest
proof
of
the
genius
of
the
eighteenth
century
see
the
fragonards
the
ladies
in
bodices
their
little
ankles
showing
amid
the
snow
of
the
petticoats
up
they
go
you
can
hear
their
light
false
voices
amid
the
summer
of
the
leaves
where
loves
are
garlanded
even
as
roses
masks
and
arrows
are
everywhere
all
the
machinery
of
light
and
gracious
days
in
the
watteaus
the
note
is
more
pensive
there
is
satin
and
sunset
plausive
gestures
and
reluctance
false
reluctance
the
guitar
is
tinkling
and
exquisite
are
the
notes
in
the
languid
evening
and
there
is
the
pierrot
that
marvellous
white
animal
sensual
and
witty
and
glad
the
soul
of
the
century
ankles
and
epigrams
everywhere
for
love
was
not
then
sentimental
it
was
false
and
a
little
cruel
see
the
furniture
and
the
polished
floor
and
the
tapestries
with
whose
delicate
tints
and
decorations
the
high
hair
blends
the
and
the
heel
and
the
calf
of
the
leg
that
is
withdrawn
showing
in
the
shadows
of
the
lace
see
the
satin
of
the
bodices
the
fan
outspread
the
wigs
so
adorably
false
the
the
buckles
on
the
shoes
how
false
adorable
little
comedy
adorably
mendacious
and
how
winsome
it
is
to
feast
on
these
sweet
lies
it
is
indeed
delight
to
us
wearied
with
the
bland
sincerity
of
newspapers
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
the
man
who
knelt
at
the
woman
feet
it
was
the
man
who
pleaded
and
the
woman
who
acceded
but
in
our
century
the
place
of
the
man
is
changed
it
is
he
who
holds
the
fan
it
is
he
who
is
besought
and
if
one
were
to
dream
of
continuing
the
tradition
of
watteau
and
fragonard
in
the
nineteenth
century
he
would
have
to
take
note
of
and
meditate
deeply
and
profoundly
on
this
as
he
sought
to
formulate
and
synthesize
the
erotic
spirit
of
our
age
the
position
of
a
young
man
in
the
nineteenth
century
is
the
most
enviable
that
has
ever
fallen
to
the
lot
of
any
human
creature
he
is
the
rare
bird
and
is
fêted
flattered
adored
the
sweetest
words
are
addressed
to
him
the
most
loving
looks
are
poured
upon
him
the
young
man
can
do
no
wrong
every
house
is
open
to
him
and
the
best
of
everything
is
laid
before
him
girls
dispute
the
right
to
serve
him
they
come
to
him
with
cake
and
wine
they
sit
circlewise
and
listen
to
him
and
when
one
is
fortunate
to
get
him
alone
she
will
hang
upon
his
neck
she
will
propose
to
him
and
will
take
his
refusal
kindly
and
without
resentment
they
will
not
let
him
stoop
to
tie
up
his
shoe
lace
but
will
rush
and
simultaneously
claim
the
right
to
attend
on
him
to
represent
in
a
novel
a
girl
proposing
marriage
to
a
man
would
be
deemed
unnatural
but
nothing
is
more
common
there
are
few
young
men
who
have
not
received
at
least
a
dozen
offers
nay
more
it
is
characteristic
it
has
become
instinctive
for
girls
to
choose
and
they
prefer
men
not
to
make
love
to
them
and
every
young
man
who
knows
his
business
avoids
making
advances
knowing
well
that
it
will
only
put
the
girl
off
in
a
society
so
constituted
what
a
delightful
opening
there
is
for
a
young
man
he
would
have
to
waltz
perfectly
play
tennis
fairly
the
latest
novel
would
suffice
for
literary
attainments
billiards
shooting
and
hunting
would
not
come
in
amiss
for
he
must
not
be
considered
a
useless
being
by
men
not
that
women
are
much
influenced
by
the
opinion
of
men
in
their
choice
of
favourites
but
the
reflex
action
of
the
heart
although
not
so
marked
as
that
of
the
stomach
exists
and
must
be
kept
in
view
besides
a
man
who
would
succeed
with
women
must
succeed
with
men
the
real
lovelace
is
loved
by
all
like
gravitation
love
draws
all
things
our
young
man
would
have
to
be
five
feet
eleven
or
six
feet
broad
shoulders
light
brown
hair
deep
eyes
soft
and
suggestive
broad
shoulders
a
thin
neck
long
delicate
hands
a
high
instep
his
nose
should
be
straight
his
face
oval
and
small
he
must
be
clean
about
the
hips
and
his
movements
must
be
naturally
caressing
he
comes
into
the
his
shoulders
well
back
he
stretches
his
hand
to
the
hostess
he
looks
at
her
earnestly
it
is
characteristic
of
him
to
think
of
the
hostess
first
he
is
in
her
house
the
house
is
and
is
suggestive
of
excellent
meats
and
wines
he
can
read
through
the
slim
woman
whose
black
hair
with
diamonds
contrasts
with
her
white
satin
an
old
man
is
talking
to
her
she
dances
with
him
and
she
refused
a
young
man
a
moment
before
this
is
a
bad
sign
our
lovelace
knows
it
there
is
a
stout
woman
of
who
is
looking
at
him
red
satin
bodice
doubtful
taste
he
looks
away
a
little
blonde
woman
fixes
her
eyes
on
him
she
looks
as
innocent
as
a
child
instinctively
our
lovelace
turns
to
his
host
who
is
that
little
blonde
woman
over
there
the
right
hand
corner
he
asks
ah
that
is
lady
will
you
introduce
me
certainly
lovelace
has
made
up
his
mind
then
there
is
a
young
oldish
girl
richly
dressed
i
hear
her
people
have
a
nice
house
in
a
hunting
country
i
will
dance
with
her
and
take
the
mother
into
supper
and
if
i
can
get
a
moment
will
have
a
pleasant
talk
with
the
father
in
the
evening
in
manner
lovelace
is
facile
and
easy
he
never
says
no
it
is
always
yes
ask
him
what
you
will
but
he
only
does
what
he
has
made
up
his
mind
it
is
his
advantage
to
do
apparently
he
is
an
embodiment
of
all
that
is
unselfish
for
he
knows
that
after
he
has
helped
himself
it
is
advisable
to
help
some
one
else
and
thereby
make
a
friend
who
on
a
future
occasion
will
be
useful
to
him
put
a
violinist
into
a
room
filled
with
violins
and
he
will
try
every
one
lovelace
will
put
each
woman
aside
so
quietly
that
she
is
often
only
half
aware
that
she
has
been
put
aside
her
life
is
broken
she
is
content
that
it
should
be
broken
the
real
genius
for
love
lies
not
in
getting
into
but
getting
out
of
love
i
have
noticed
that
there
are
times
when
every
second
woman
likes
you
is
love
then
a
magnetism
which
we
sometimes
possess
and
exercise
unconsciously
and
sometimes
do
not
possess
xiv
now
i
am
full
of
eager
impulses
that
mourn
and
howl
by
turns
striving
for
utterance
like
wind
in
turret
chambers
i
hate
this
infernal
lodging
i
feel
like
a
fowl
in
a
coop
that
landlady
those
children
emma
the
actress
will
be
coming
upstairs
presently
shall
i
ask
her
into
my
room
better
let
things
remain
as
they
are
why
intrude
a
new
vexation
on
her
already
vexed
life
hallo
you
startled
me
well
i
am
surprised
we
have
not
talked
together
for
a
long
time
since
when
i
will
spare
your
feelings
i
merely
thought
i
would
remind
you
that
you
have
passed
the
rubicon
your
thirtieth
year
it
is
terrible
to
think
of
my
youth
gone
then
you
are
ashamed
you
repent
i
am
ashamed
of
nothing
i
am
a
writer
is
my
profession
not
to
be
ashamed
i
had
forgotten
so
you
are
lost
to
shame
completely
i
will
chat
with
you
when
you
please
even
now
at
this
hour
about
all
things
about
any
of
my
sins
since
we
lost
sight
of
each
other
you
have
devoted
your
time
to
the
gratification
of
your
senses
pardon
me
i
have
devoted
quite
as
much
of
my
time
to
art
you
were
glad
i
remember
when
your
father
died
because
his
death
gave
you
unlimited
facilities
for
moulding
the
partial
self
which
the
restraining
influence
of
home
had
only
permitted
into
that
complete
and
ideal
george
moore
which
you
had
in
mind
i
think
i
quote
you
correctly
you
do
but
never
mind
proceed
then
if
you
have
no
objection
we
will
examine
how
far
you
have
turned
your
opportunities
to
account
you
will
not
deny
that
i
have
educated
myself
and
made
many
friends
friends
your
nature
is
very
adaptable
you
interest
yourself
in
their
pursuits
and
so
deceive
them
into
a
false
estimate
of
your
worth
your
education
speak
not
of
it
it
is
but
flimsy
stuff
there
i
join
issue
with
you
have
i
not
drawn
the
intense
ego
out
of
the
clouds
of
and
realised
it
and
surely
the
rescue
and
the
individualisation
of
the
ego
is
the
first
step
to
what
end
you
have
nothing
to
teach
nothing
to
reveal
i
have
often
thought
of
asking
you
this
since
death
is
the
only
good
why
do
you
not
embrace
death
of
all
the
world
goods
it
is
the
cheapest
and
the
most
easily
obtained
we
must
live
since
nature
has
willed
it
so
my
poor
conscience
are
you
still
struggling
in
the
fallacy
of
free
will
for
at
least
a
hundred
thousand
years
man
has
rendered
this
planet
abominable
and
ridiculous
with
what
he
is
pleased
to
call
his
intelligence
without
however
having
learned
that
his
life
is
merely
the
breaking
of
the
peace
of
unconsciousness
the
drowsy
uplifting
of
tired
eyelids
of
somnolent
nature
how
glibly
this
loquacious
ape
chatters
of
his
religion
and
his
moral
sense
always
failing
to
see
that
both
are
but
allurements
and
inveiglements
with
religion
he
is
induced
to
bear
his
misery
and
his
sexual
appetite
is
preserved
ignorant
and
vigorous
by
means
of
morals
a
scorpion
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
fire
will
sting
itself
to
death
and
man
would
turn
upon
life
and
deny
it
if
his
reason
were
complete
religion
and
morals
are
the
poker
and
tongs
with
which
nature
intervenes
and
scatters
the
ring
of
reason
after
a
long
pause
i
believe
forgive
my
ignorance
but
i
have
seen
so
little
of
you
this
long
while
that
your
boast
is
that
no
woman
influenced
changed
or
modified
your
views
of
life
none
my
mind
is
a
blank
on
the
subject
stay
my
mother
said
once
when
i
was
a
boy
you
must
not
believe
them
all
their
smiles
and
pretty
ways
are
only
put
on
women
like
men
only
for
what
they
can
get
out
of
them
and
to
these
simple
words
i
attribute
all
the
suspicion
of
woman
truth
which
hung
over
my
youth
for
years
it
seemed
to
me
impossible
that
women
could
love
men
women
seemed
to
me
so
beautiful
and
desirable
men
so
hideous
and
revolting
could
they
touch
us
without
revulsion
of
feeling
could
they
really
desire
us
i
was
absorbed
in
the
life
of
woman
the
mystery
of
petticoats
so
different
from
the
staidness
of
trousers
the
rolls
of
hair
entwined
with
so
much
art
and
suggesting
so
much
colour
and
perfume
so
different
from
the
bare
crop
the
unnaturalness
of
the
waist
in
stays
plenitude
and
slenderness
of
silk
so
different
from
the
stupidity
of
a
black
rose
feet
passing
under
the
triple
ruches
of
rose
so
different
from
the
broad
foot
of
the
male
my
love
for
the
life
of
women
was
a
life
within
my
life
and
oh
how
strangely
secluded
and
veiled
a
world
of
calm
colour
with
phantoms
moving
floating
past
and
changing
in
dim
light
an
averted
face
with
abundant
hair
the
gleam
of
a
perfect
bust
or
the
poise
of
a
neck
turning
slowly
round
the
gaze
of
deep
translucid
eyes
i
loved
women
too
much
to
give
myself
wholly
to
one
yes
yes
but
what
real
success
have
you
had
with
women
damn
it
you
would
not
seek
to
draw
me
into
stories
about
women
how
it
began
how
it
was
broken
off
how
it
began
again
i
not
casenova
i
love
women
as
i
love
champagne
i
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
but
an
exact
account
of
every
bottle
drunk
would
prove
flat
narrative
you
have
never
consulted
me
about
your
champagne
loves
but
you
have
asked
me
if
you
have
ever
inspired
a
real
affection
and
i
told
you
that
we
can
not
inspire
in
others
what
does
not
exist
in
ourselves
you
have
never
known
a
nice
woman
who
would
have
married
you
why
should
i
undertake
to
keep
a
woman
by
me
for
the
entire
space
of
her
life
watching
her
grow
fat
grey
wrinkled
and
foolish
think
of
the
annoyance
of
perpetually
looking
after
any
one
especially
a
woman
besides
marriage
is
antagonistic
to
my
ideal
you
say
that
no
ideal
illumines
the
pessimist
life
that
if
you
ask
him
why
he
exists
he
can
not
answer
and
that
schopenhauer
arguments
against
suicide
are
not
even
plausible
causistry
true
on
this
point
his
reasoning
is
feeble
and
ineffective
but
we
may
easily
confute
our
sensual
opponents
we
must
say
that
we
do
not
commit
suicide
although
we
admit
it
is
a
certain
anodyne
to
the
poison
of
life
an
absolute
erasure
of
the
wrong
inflicted
on
us
by
our
parents
because
we
hope
by
noble
example
and
precept
to
induce
others
to
refrain
from
love
we
are
the
saviours
of
souls
other
crimes
are
finite
love
alone
is
infinite
we
punish
a
man
with
death
for
killing
his
fellow
but
a
little
reflection
should
make
the
dullest
understand
that
the
crime
of
bringing
a
being
into
the
world
exceeds
by
a
thousand
a
millionfold
that
of
putting
one
out
of
it
men
are
as
thick
as
flies
in
a
confectioner
shop
in
fifty
years
there
will
be
less
to
eat
but
certainly
some
millions
more
mouths
i
laugh
i
rub
my
hands
i
shall
be
dead
before
the
red
time
comes
i
laugh
at
the
religionists
who
say
that
god
provides
for
those
he
brings
into
the
world
the
french
revolution
will
compare
with
the
revolution
that
is
to
come
that
must
come
that
is
inevitable
as
a
puddle
on
the
compares
with
the
sea
men
will
hang
like
pears
on
every
in
every
great
quarter
of
london
there
will
be
an
electric
guillotine
that
will
decapitate
the
rich
like
hogs
in
chicago
christ
who
with
his
white
feet
trod
out
the
blood
of
the
ancient
world
and
promised
universal
peace
shall
go
out
in
a
cataclysm
of
blood
the
neck
of
mankind
shall
be
opened
and
blood
shall
cover
the
face
of
the
earth
your
philosophy
is
on
a
par
with
your
painting
and
your
poetry
but
then
i
am
a
conscience
and
a
conscience
is
never
philosophic
you
go
in
for
the
philosophy
of
the
unconscious
no
no
is
but
a
silly
vulgarisation
but
schopenhauer
oh
my
schopenhauer
say
shall
i
go
about
preaching
hatred
of
women
were
i
to
call
them
a
race
that
was
admitted
into
society
only
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
you
can
not
speak
the
truth
even
to
me
no
not
even
at
twelve
at
night
surely
of
all
hours
this
is
the
one
in
which
it
is
advisable
to
play
you
false
you
are
getting
humorous
i
am
getting
sleepy
you
are
a
tiresome
old
thing
a
relic
of
the
ancient
world
i
mean
the
mediæval
world
you
know
that
i
now
affect
antiquity
you
wander
helplessly
in
the
road
of
life
until
you
stumble
against
a
battery
nerved
with
the
shock
you
are
frantic
and
rush
along
wildly
until
the
current
received
is
exhausted
and
you
lapse
into
disorganisation
if
i
am
sensitive
to
and
absorb
the
various
potentialities
of
my
age
am
i
not
of
necessity
a
power
to
be
the
receptacle
of
and
the
medium
through
which
unexplained
forces
work
is
a
very
petty
office
to
fulfil
can
you
think
of
nothing
higher
can
you
feel
nothing
original
in
you
a
something
that
is
cognisant
of
the
end
you
are
surely
not
going
to
drop
into
talking
to
me
of
god
you
will
not
deny
that
i
at
least
exist
i
am
with
you
now
and
intensely
far
more
than
the
dear
friend
with
whom
you
love
to
walk
in
the
quiet
evening
the
women
you
have
held
to
your
bosom
in
the
perfumed
darkness
of
the
chamber
pray
do
the
perfumed
darkness
of
the
chamber
is
very
common
i
was
suckled
on
that
kind
of
literature
you
are
rotten
to
the
root
nothing
but
a
very
severe
attack
of
indigestion
would
bring
you
to
your
senses
or
a
long
lingering
illness
my
faith
you
are
growing
melodramatic
neither
indigestion
nor
illness
long
drawn
out
can
change
me
i
have
torn
you
all
to
pieces
long
ago
and
you
have
not
now
sufficient
rags
on
your
back
to
scare
the
rooks
in
in
destroying
me
you
have
destroyed
yourself
edgar
poe
pure
and
simple
do
pick
holes
in
my
originality
until
you
have
mended
those
in
your
own
i
was
poe
inspiration
he
is
eternal
being
of
me
but
your
inspiration
springs
from
the
flesh
and
is
therefore
ephemeral
even
as
the
flesh
if
you
had
read
schopenhauer
you
would
know
that
the
flesh
is
not
ephemeral
but
the
eternal
objectification
of
the
will
to
live
siva
is
represented
not
only
with
the
necklace
of
skulls
but
with
the
lingam
you
have
failed
in
all
you
have
attempted
and
the
figure
you
have
raised
on
your
father
tomb
is
merely
a
sensitive
and
sensuous
being
who
lives
in
a
dirty
lodging
and
plays
in
desperate
desperation
his
last
card
you
are
now
writing
a
novel
the
hero
is
a
wretched
creature
something
like
yourself
do
you
think
there
is
a
public
in
england
for
that
kind
of
thing
just
the
great
philistine
that
you
always
were
what
do
you
mean
by
a
public
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
on
that
account
your
one
virtue
is
sobriety
a
wretched
pun
the
mass
of
mankind
run
much
after
the
fashion
of
the
sheep
of
panurge
but
there
are
always
a
few
that
a
few
that
are
like
the
gadarene
swine
ah
were
i
the
precipice
were
i
the
sea
in
which
the
pigs
might
drown
the
same
old
desire
of
admiration
admiration
in
its
original
sense
of
wonderment
miratio
you
are
a
true
child
of
the
century
you
do
not
desire
admiration
you
would
avoid
it
fearing
it
might
lessen
that
sense
which
you
only
care
to
stimulate
wonderment
and
persecuted
by
the
desire
to
astonish
you
are
now
exhibiting
yourself
in
the
most
hideous
light
you
can
devise
the
man
whose
biography
you
are
writing
is
no
better
than
a
pimp
then
he
is
not
like
me
i
have
never
been
a
pimp
and
i
do
think
i
would
be
if
i
could
the
whole
of
your
moral
nature
is
reflected
in
lewis
seymore
even
to
the
and
i
do
think
i
would
be
if
i
could
i
love
the
abnormal
and
there
is
certainly
something
strangely
grotesque
in
the
life
of
a
pimp
but
it
is
nonsense
to
suggest
that
lewis
seymore
is
myself
you
know
that
my
original
notion
was
to
do
the
side
of
lucien
de
rubrempré
that
that
balzac
had
the
genius
to
leave
out
really
if
you
can
only
make
disagreeable
remarks
i
think
we
had
better
bring
this
conversation
to
a
close
one
word
more
you
have
failed
in
everything
you
have
attempted
and
you
will
continue
to
fail
until
you
consider
those
moral
principles
those
rules
of
conduct
which
the
race
has
built
up
guided
by
an
unerring
instinct
of
humanity
defends
herself
against
those
who
attempt
to
subvert
her
and
none
neither
napoleon
nor
the
wretched
scribbler
such
as
you
are
has
escaped
her
vengeance
you
would
have
me
pull
down
the
black
flag
and
turn
myself
into
an
honest
merchantman
with
children
in
the
hold
and
a
wife
at
the
helm
you
would
remind
me
that
grey
hairs
begin
to
show
that
health
falls
into
rags
that
high
spirits
split
like
canvas
and
that
in
the
end
the
bright
buccaneer
drifts
an
old
derelict
tossed
by
the
waves
of
ill
fortune
and
buffeted
by
the
winds
into
those
dismal
bays
and
dangerous
offings
housekeepers
nurses
and
uncomfortable
chambers
such
will
be
my
fate
and
since
none
may
avert
his
fate
none
can
do
better
than
to
run
pluckily
the
course
which
he
must
pursue
you
might
devise
a
moral
ending
one
that
would
conciliate
all
classes
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
are
a
conscience
i
do
not
hope
to
find
a
saint
augustine
in
you
an
idea
one
of
these
days
i
will
write
my
confessions
again
i
tell
you
that
nothing
really
matters
to
me
but
art
and
knowing
this
you
chatter
of
the
unwisdom
of
my
not
concluding
my
novel
with
some
foolish
moral
nothing
matters
to
me
but
art
would
you
seduce
the
wretched
servant
girl
if
by
so
doing
you
could
pluck
out
the
mystery
of
her
being
and
set
it
down
on
paper
xv
and
now
hypocritical
reader
i
will
answer
the
questions
which
have
been
agitating
you
this
long
while
which
you
have
asked
at
every
stage
of
this
long
narrative
of
a
sinful
life
shake
not
your
head
lift
not
your
finger
exquisitely
hypocritical
reader
you
can
deceive
me
in
nothing
i
know
the
base
and
unworthy
soul
this
is
a
magical
such
a
one
as
will
never
happen
in
your
life
again
therefore
i
say
let
us
put
off
all
customary
disguise
let
us
be
frank
you
have
been
angrily
asking
exquisitely
hypocritical
reader
why
you
have
been
to
read
this
record
of
sinful
life
in
your
exquisite
hypocrisy
you
have
said
over
and
over
again
what
good
purpose
can
it
serve
for
a
man
to
tell
us
of
his
unworthiness
unless
indeed
it
is
to
show
us
how
he
may
rise
as
if
on
stepping
stones
of
his
dead
self
to
higher
things
etc
you
sighed
o
hypocritical
friend
and
you
threw
the
magazine
on
the
wicker
table
where
such
things
lie
and
you
murmured
something
about
leaving
the
world
a
little
better
than
you
found
it
and
you
went
down
to
dinner
and
lost
consciousness
of
the
world
in
the
animal
enjoyment
of
your
stomach
i
hold
out
my
hand
to
you
i
embrace
you
you
are
my
brother
and
i
say
undeceive
yourself
you
will
leave
the
world
no
better
than
you
found
it
the
pig
that
is
being
slaughtered
as
i
write
this
line
will
leave
the
world
better
than
it
found
it
but
you
will
leave
only
a
putrid
carcase
fit
for
nothing
but
worms
look
back
upon
your
life
examine
it
probe
it
weigh
it
philosophise
on
it
and
then
say
if
you
dare
that
it
has
not
been
a
very
futile
and
foolish
affair
soldier
robber
priest
atheist
courtesan
virgin
i
care
not
what
you
are
if
you
have
not
brought
children
into
the
world
to
suffer
your
life
has
been
as
vain
and
as
harmless
as
mine
has
been
i
hold
out
my
hand
to
you
we
are
brothers
but
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
think
myself
a
cut
above
you
because
i
do
not
believe
in
leaving
the
world
better
than
i
found
it
and
you
exquisitely
hypocritical
reader
think
that
you
are
a
cut
above
me
because
you
say
you
would
leave
the
world
better
than
you
found
it
the
one
eternal
and
immutable
delight
of
life
is
to
think
for
one
reason
or
another
that
we
are
better
than
our
neighbours
this
is
why
i
wrote
this
book
and
this
is
why
it
is
affording
you
so
much
pleasure
o
exquisitely
hypocritical
reader
my
friend
my
brother
because
it
helps
you
to
the
belief
that
you
are
not
so
bad
after
all
now
to
resume
the
knell
of
my
thirtieth
year
has
sounded
in
three
or
four
years
my
youth
will
be
as
a
faint
haze
on
the
sea
an
illusive
recollection
so
now
while
standing
on
the
last
verge
of
the
hill
i
will
look
back
on
the
valley
i
lingered
in
do
i
regret
i
neither
repent
nor
do
i
regret
and
a
fool
and
a
weakling
i
should
be
if
i
did
i
know
the
worth
and
the
rarity
of
more
than
ten
years
of
systematic
enjoyment
nature
provided
me
with
as
perfect
a
digestive
apparatus
mental
and
physical
as
she
ever
turned
out
of
her
workshop
my
stomach
and
brain
are
set
in
the
most
perfect
equipoise
possible
to
conceive
and
up
and
down
they
went
and
still
go
with
measured
movement
absorbing
and
assimilating
all
that
is
poured
into
them
without
friction
or
stoppage
this
book
is
a
record
of
my
mental
digestions
but
it
would
take
another
series
of
confessions
to
tell
of
the
dinners
i
have
eaten
the
champagne
i
have
drunk
and
the
suppers
seven
dozen
of
oysters
heaps
of
truffles
salad
and
then
a
walk
home
in
the
early
morning
a
few
philosophical
reflections
suggested
by
the
appearance
of
a
belated
then
sleep
quiet
and
gentle
sleep
i
have
had
the
rarest
the
finest
friends
i
have
loved
my
friends
the
rarest
wits
of
my
generation
were
my
boon
companions
everything
conspired
to
enable
me
to
gratify
my
body
and
my
brain
and
do
you
think
this
would
have
been
so
if
i
had
been
a
good
man
if
you
do
you
are
a
fool
good
intentions
and
bald
greed
go
to
the
wall
but
subtle
selfishness
with
a
dash
of
unscrupulousness
pulls
more
plums
out
of
life
pie
than
the
seven
deadly
virtues
if
you
are
a
good
man
you
want
a
bad
one
to
convert
if
you
are
a
bad
man
you
want
a
bad
one
to
go
out
on
the
spree
with
and
you
my
dear
my
exquisite
reader
place
your
hand
upon
your
heart
tell
the
truth
remember
this
is
a
magical
which
will
happen
never
again
in
your
life
admit
that
you
feel
just
a
little
interested
in
my
wickedness
admit
that
if
you
ever
thought
you
would
like
to
know
me
that
it
is
because
i
know
a
good
deal
that
you
probably
do
admit
that
your
mouth
waters
when
you
think
of
rich
and
various
pleasures
that
fell
to
my
share
in
happy
paris
admit
that
if
this
book
had
been
an
account
of
the
pious
books
i
had
read
the
churches
i
had
been
to
and
the
good
works
i
had
done
that
you
would
not
have
bought
it
or
borrowed
it
hypocritical
reader
think
had
you
had
courage
health
and
money
to
lead
a
fast
life
would
you
not
have
done
so
you
do
know
no
more
do
i
i
have
done
so
and
i
regret
nothing
except
that
some
infernal
farmers
and
miners
will
not
pay
me
what
they
owe
me
and
enable
me
to
continue
the
life
that
was
once
mine
and
of
which
i
was
so
bright
an
ornament
how
i
hate
this
atrocious
strand
how
i
long
for
my
apartment
in
de
la
tour
des
with
all
its
charming
adjuncts
palms
and
pastels
my
cat
my
python
my
friends
blond
hair
and
dark
the
daily
article
soon
grows
monotonous
even
when
you
know
it
will
be
printed
and
this
i
did
not
know
my
prose
was
very
faulty
and
my
ideas
were
unsettled
i
could
not
go
to
the
tap
and
draw
them
off
the
liquor
was
still
fermenting
and
partly
because
my
articles
were
not
very
easily
disposed
of
and
partly
because
i
was
weary
of
writing
on
different
subjects
i
turned
my
attention
to
short
stories
i
wrote
a
dozen
some
were
printed
in
weekly
newspapers
some
were
returned
to
me
there
was
a
publisher
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
strand
who
used
to
frequent
a
certain
bar
and
this
worthy
man
conducted
his
business
as
he
dressed
himself
sloppily
a
dear
kind
soul
quite
witless
and
quite
from
long
habit
he
would
make
a
feeble
attempt
to
drive
a
bargain
but
he
was
duped
generally
if
a
fashionable
author
asked
two
hundred
pounds
for
a
book
out
of
which
he
would
be
certain
to
make
three
it
was
ten
to
one
that
he
would
allow
the
chance
to
drift
away
from
him
but
after
having
refused
a
dozen
times
the
work
of
a
strand
loafer
whom
he
was
in
the
habit
of
treating
he
would
say
send
it
in
my
boy
send
it
in
i
see
what
can
be
done
with
it
there
was
a
long
counter
and
the
way
to
be
published
by
mr
was
to
straddle
on
the
counter
and
play
with
a
black
cat
there
was
an
irishman
behind
this
counter
who
for
three
pounds
a
week
edited
the
magazine
read
the
looked
after
the
printer
and
binder
kept
the
accounts
and
entertained
the
visitors
i
did
not
trouble
messrs
macmillan
and
messrs
longman
with
polite
requests
to
look
at
my
i
straddled
played
with
the
cat
joked
with
the
irishman
drank
with
and
in
the
natural
order
of
things
my
stories
went
into
the
magazine
and
were
paid
for
strange
were
the
ways
of
this
office
shakespeare
might
have
sent
in
prose
and
poetry
but
he
would
have
gone
into
the
wastepaper
basket
had
he
not
previously
straddled
for
those
who
were
in
the
know
this
was
a
matter
of
congratulation
straddling
we
would
cry
we
want
no
blooming
outsiders
coming
along
interfering
with
our
magazine
and
you
smith
you
devil
you
had
a
story
in
last
month
and
cut
me
out
do
you
mind
if
i
send
you
in
a
couple
of
poems
as
well
as
my
regular
stuff
that
will
make
it
all
square
i
try
to
manage
it
here
the
governor
and
looking
exactly
like
the
unfortunate
mr
sedley
mr
used
to
slouch
in
he
would
fall
into
his
leather
armchair
the
one
in
which
he
wrote
the
cheques
the
last
time
i
saw
that
chair
it
was
standing
in
the
street
in
the
hands
of
the
brokers
but
conservative
though
we
were
in
matters
concerning
copy
though
all
means
were
taken
to
protect
ourselves
against
interlopers
one
who
had
not
passed
the
preliminary
stage
of
straddling
would
occasionally
slip
through
our
defences
one
hot
summer
day
we
were
all
on
the
counter
our
legs
swinging
when
an
enormous
young
man
entered
he
must
have
been
six
feet
three
in
height
he
was
shown
into
mr
b
room
he
asked
him
to
read
a
and
he
fled
looking
very
frightened
wastepaper
basket
wastepaper
basket
we
shouted
what
an
fish
he
is
like
a
pike
said
i
wonder
what
his
is
like
very
like
a
pike
we
cried
but
took
the
home
to
read
and
returned
next
morning
convinced
he
had
discovered
an
embryo
dickens
the
young
man
was
asked
to
call
his
book
was
accepted
and
we
adjourned
to
the
bar
this
young
man
took
rooms
in
the
house
next
to
me
on
the
ground
floor
he
had
been
to
oxford
and
to
heidelberg
he
drank
beer
and
smoked
long
pipes
he
talked
of
nothing
but
tobacco
soon
very
soon
i
began
to
see
that
he
thought
me
a
simpleton
he
my
belief
in
naturalism
and
declined
to
discuss
the
symbolist
question
he
curled
his
long
legs
upon
the
rickety
sofa
and
spoke
of
the
british
public
as
the
and
of
the
magazine
as
the
mag
and
in
the
office
which
i
had
marked
down
as
my
own
i
saw
him
installed
as
a
genius
he
brought
a
little
man
about
five
feet
three
to
live
with
him
and
when
the
two
the
long
and
the
short
went
out
together
it
was
like
don
quixote
and
sancho
panza
setting
forth
in
quest
of
adventures
in
the
land
of
strand
the
short
man
indulged
in
none
of
the
loud
rasping
affectation
of
humour
that
was
so
maddening
in
the
long
he
was
dry
hard
and
sterile
and
when
he
did
join
in
the
conversation
it
was
like
an
empty
nut
between
the
teeth
dusty
and
bitter
he
kept
a
in
which
he
held
an
account
of
his
reading
holding
the
between
finger
and
thumb
he
would
say
last
year
i
read
ten
plays
by
nash
twelve
by
peele
six
by
greene
fifteen
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
and
eleven
anonymous
plays
in
all
footnotes
footnote
the
use
of
the
word
sinful
here
seems
liable
to
misinterpretation
the
phrase
should
run
of
a
virtuous
life

that

fortunately
for
my
life
and
my
sanity
my
interests
were
about
this
time
attracted
into
other
ways
ways
that
led
into
london
life
and
were
suitable
for
me
to
tread
in
a
restaurant
where
dresses
and
evening
clothes
crushed
with
loud
exclamations
where
there
was
ever
an
odour
of
cigarette
and
brandy
and
soda
i
was
introduced
to
a
jew
of
whom
i
had
heard
much
a
man
who
had
newspapers
and
racehorses
the
bright
witty
glances
of
his
brown
eyes
at
once
prejudiced
me
in
his
favour
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
knew
that
i
had
found
another
friend
his
house
was
what
was
wanted
for
it
was
so
trenchant
in
character
so
different
from
all
i
knew
of
that
i
was
forced
to
accept
it
without
likening
it
to
any
french
memory
and
thereby
weakening
the
impression
it
was
a
house
of
champagne
late
hours
and
evening
clothes
of
literature
and
art
of
passionate
discussions
so
this
house
was
not
so
alien
to
me
as
all
else
i
had
seen
in
london
and
perhaps
the
cosmopolitanism
of
this
charming
jew
his
hellenism
in
fact
was
a
sort
of
plank
whereon
i
might
pass
and
enter
again
into
english
life
i
found
in
curzon
street
another
nouvelle
athènes
a
bohemianism
of
titles
that
went
back
to
the
conquest
a
bohemianism
of
the
ten
sovereigns
always
jingling
in
the
trousers
pocket
of
scrupulous
cleanliness
of
hansom
cabs
of
ladies
pet
names
of
triumphant
champagne
of
debts
gaslight
morning
light
coaching
a
fabulous
bohemianism
a
bohemianism
of
eternal
and
eternal
squandering
of
money
money
that
rose
at
no
discoverable
and
flowed
into
a
sea
of
boudoirs
and
restaurants
a
sort
of
whirlpool
of
sovereigns
in
which
we
were
caught
and
sent
eddying
through
music
halls
bright
shoulders
tresses
of
hair
and
slang
and
i
joined
in
the
adorable
game
of
bohemianism
that
was
played
round
and
about
piccadilly
circus
with
curzon
street
for
a
magnificent
rallying
point
after
dinner
a
general
clear
was
made
in
the
direction
of
halls
and
theatres
a
few
friends
would
drop
in
about
twelve
and
continue
their
drinking
till
three
or
four
but
saturday
night
was
gala
night
at
eleven
the
lords
drove
up
in
their
hansoms
then
a
genius
or
two
would
arrive
and
supper
and
singing
went
merrily
until
the
chimney
sweeps
began
to
go
by
then
we
took
chairs
and
bottles
into
the
street
and
entered
into
discussion
with
the
policeman
twelve
hours
later
we
struggled
out
of
our
beds
and
to
the
sound
of
church
bells
we
commenced
writing
the
paper
appeared
on
tuesday
our
host
sat
in
a
small
room
off
the
from
which
he
occasionally
emerged
to
stimulate
our
lagging
pens
but
i
could
not
learn
to
see
life
paragraphically
i
longed
to
give
a
personal
shape
to
something
and
personal
shape
could
not
be
achieved
in
a
paragraph
nor
in
an
article
true
it
is
that
i
longed
for
art
but
i
longed
also
for
fame
or
was
it
notoriety
both
i
longed
for
fame
brutal
and
glaring
out
with
you
liars
that
you
are
tell
the
truth
say
you
would
sell
the
souls
you
do
believe
in
or
do
believe
in
for
notoriety
i
have
known
you
attend
funerals
for
the
sake
of
seeing
your
miserable
names
in
the
paper
you
hypocritical
reader
who
are
now
turning
up
your
eyes
and
murmuring
dreadful
young
man
examine
your
weakly
heart
and
see
what
divides
us
i
am
not
ashamed
of
my
appetites
i
proclaim
them
what
is
more
i
gratify
them
you
silent
you
refrain
and
you
dress
up
natural
sins
in
hideous
garments
of
shame
you
would
sell
your
wretched
soul
for
what
i
would
not
give
the
parings
of
my
for
paragraphs
in
a
society
paper
i
am
ashamed
of
nothing
i
have
done
especially
my
sins
and
i
boldly
confess
that
i
then
desired
notoriety
am
i
going
to
fail
again
as
i
have
failed
before
i
asked
myself
will
my
novel
prove
as
abortive
as
my
paintings
my
poetry
my
journalism
we
all
want
notoriety
our
desire
for
notoriety
is
ugly
but
it
is
less
hideous
when
it
is
proclaimed
from
a
brazen
tongue
than
when
it
lisps
the
cant
of
humanitarianism
self
and
after
self
a
friend
the
rest
may
go
to
the
devil
and
be
sure
that
when
any
man
is
more
stupidly
vain
and
outrageously
egotistic
than
his
fellows
he
will
hide
his
hideousness
in
humanitarianism
victor
hugo
was
the
innermost
stench
of
the
humanitarianism
and
mr
swinburne
holds
his
nose
with
one
hand
while
he
waves
the
censer
with
the
other
men
of
inferior
genius
victor
hugo
and
mr
gladstone
take
refuge
in
humanitarianism
humanitarianism
is
a
pigsty
where
liars
hypocrites
and
the
obscene
in
spirit
congregate
it
has
been
so
since
the
great
jew
conceived
it
and
it
will
be
so
till
the
end
far
better
the
blithe
modern
pagan
in
his
white
tie
and
evening
clothes
and
his
facile
philosophy
he
says
i
do
care
how
the
poor
live
my
only
regret
is
that
they
live
at
all
and
he
gives
the
beggar
a
shilling
we
all
want
notoriety
our
desires
on
this
point
as
upon
others
are
not
noble
but
the
human
is
very
despicable
vermin
and
only
tolerable
when
it
tends
to
the
brute
and
away
from
the
evangelical
i
will
tell
you
an
anecdote
which
is
in
itself
an
admirable
illustration
of
my
craving
for
notoriety
and
my
anecdote
will
serve
a
double
purpose
it
will
bring
me
some
of
the
notoriety
of
which
i
am
so
desirous
for
you
dear
exquisitely
hypocritical
reader
will
at
once
cry
shame
could
a
man
be
so
wicked
as
to
attempt
to
force
on
a
duel
so
that
he
might
make
himself
known
through
the
medium
of
a
legal
murder
you
will
tell
your
friends
of
this
horribly
unprincipled
young
man
and
they
will
of
course
instantly
want
to
know
more
about
him
it
was
a
gala
night
in
curzon
street
the
lords
were
driving
up
in
hansoms
some
seated
on
the
roofs
with
their
legs
swinging
inside
the
comics
had
arrived
from
the
halls
there
were
ladies
many
ladies
choruses
were
going
merrily
in
the
one
man
was
attempting
to
kick
the
chandelier
another
stood
on
his
head
on
the
sofa
there
was
a
beautiful
young
lord
there
that
sort
of
figure
that
no
woman
can
resist
there
was
a
delightful
youth
who
seemed
inclined
to
empty
the
down
my
neck
him
i
could
keep
in
order
but
the
beautiful
lord
was
attempting
to
make
a
butt
of
me
with
his
impertinences
i
did
not
for
a
moment
intend
to
put
up
i
did
not
know
him
he
was
not
then
as
he
is
now
if
he
will
allow
me
to
say
so
a
friend
the
ladies
retired
about
then
and
the
festivities
continued
we
had
passed
through
various
stages
of
jubilation
no
one
was
drunk
but
we
had
been
jocose
and
rowdy
we
had
told
stories
of
all
kinds
the
young
lord
and
i
did
not
pull
well
together
but
nothing
decidedly
unpleasant
occurred
until
someone
proposed
to
drink
to
the
downfall
of
gladstone
the
beautiful
lord
got
on
his
legs
and
began
a
speech
politically
it
was
sound
enough
but
much
of
it
was
plainly
intended
to
turn
me
into
ridicule
i
answered
sharply
working
gradually
up
crescendo
until
at
last
to
bring
matters
to
a
head
i
said
i
do
agree
with
you
the
land
act
of
was
a
necessity
anyone
who
thinks
so
must
be
a
fool
very
possibly
but
i
do
allow
people
to
address
such
language
to
me
and
you
must
be
aware
that
to
call
anyone
a
fool
sitting
with
you
at
table
in
the
house
of
a
friend
is
the
act
of
a
cad
there
was
a
lull
then
a
moment
after
he
said
i
only
meant
politically
and
i
only
meant
socially
he
advanced
a
step
or
two
and
struck
me
across
the
face
with
his
finger
tips
i
took
up
a
champagne
bottle
and
struck
him
across
the
head
and
shoulders
different
parties
of
revellers
kept
us
apart
and
we
walked
up
and
down
on
either
side
of
the
table
swearing
at
each
other
although
i
was
very
wroth
i
had
had
a
certain
consciousness
from
the
first
that
if
i
played
my
cards
well
i
might
come
very
well
out
of
the
quarrel
and
as
i
walked
down
the
street
i
determined
to
make
every
effort
to
force
on
a
meeting
if
the
quarrel
had
been
with
one
of
the
singers
i
should
have
backed
out
of
it
but
i
had
everything
to
gain
by
pressing
it
i
grasped
the
situation
at
once
all
the
liberal
press
would
be
on
my
side
the
conservative
press
would
have
nothing
to
say
against
me
no
woman
in
it
and
a
duel
with
a
lord
would
be
nuts
and
apples
for
the
journalists
i
did
not
go
to
bed
at
once
but
sat
in
the
armchair
thinking
calculating
my
chances
a
cab
came
rattling
up
to
the
door
and
one
of
the
revellers
came
upstairs
he
told
me
that
everything
had
been
arranged
i
told
him
that
i
was
not
in
the
habit
of
allowing
others
to
arrange
my
affairs
for
me
and
went
to
bed
among
my
old
friends
i
could
think
of
some
that
would
suit
me
perfectly
but
where
were
they
ten
years
absence
scatters
friends
as
october
scatters
swallows
the
first
one
said
it
was
about
one
or
two
in
the
morning
later
than
that
it
was
about
seven
he
struck
you
and
not
very
hard
i
should
imagine
you
hit
him
with
a
champagne
bottle
and
now
you
want
to
have
him
out
i
did
not
come
here
to
listen
to
moral
reflections
if
you
do
like
to
act
for
me
say
so
i
telegraphed
to
warwickshire
to
an
old
friend
can
i
count
on
you
to
act
for
me
in
an
affair
of
honour
two
or
three
hours
after
the
reply
came
come
down
here
and
stay
with
me
for
a
few
days
we
talk
it
over
english
people
i
said
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
serious
duelling
i
must
telegraph
to
marshall
of
all
importance
come
over
at
once
and
act
for
me
in
an
affair
of
honour
bring
the
count
with
you
leave
him
at
boulogne
he
knows
the
colonel
of
the
the
next
day
i
received
the
following
am
burying
my
father
as
soon
as
he
is
underground
will
come
was
there
ever
such
he
wo
be
here
before
the
end
of
the
week
these
things
demand
the
utmost
promptitude
three
or
four
days
afterwards
emma
told
me
a
gentleman
was
upstairs
taking
a
bath
hollo
marshall
how
are
you
had
a
good
crossing
the
poor
old
gentleman
went
off
quite
suddenly
i
suppose
yes
found
dead
in
his
bed
he
must
have
known
he
was
dying
for
he
lay
quite
straight
as
the
dead
lie
his
hands
by
his
side
wonderful
presence
of
mind
he
left
no
money
not
a
penny
but
i
could
manage
it
all
right
since
my
success
at
the
salon
i
have
been
able
to
sell
my
things
i
am
only
beginning
to
find
out
now
what
a
success
that
picture
was
je
fais
crois
ça
on
fait
après
vingt
ans
de
when
we
were
excited
marshall
and
i
always
dropped
into
french
and
now
tell
me
he
said
about
this
duel
no
sooner
had
i
begun
to
tell
the
story
than
it
dawned
upon
me
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
it
seriously
for
it
was
fundamentally
an
absurd
story
and
i
lacked
courage
to
tell
marshall
that
i
only
wished
to
go
through
with
the
duel
in
order
to
become
notorious
no
one
will
admit
such
a
thing
as
that
to
his
friend
and
if
i
had
admitted
it
marshall
would
not
have
consented
i
suddenly
began
to
get
interested
in
other
things
there
was
marshall
painting
to
talk
about
after
the
theatre
we
went
home
and
æstheticised
till
three
in
the
morning
the
duel
became
the
least
important
event
and
marshall
new
picture
the
greatest
at
breakfast
next
day
the
duel
seemed
more
tiresome
than
ever
but
the
gentlemen
were
coming
to
meet
marshall
he
showed
his
usual
tact
in
arranging
my
affair
of
honour
a
letter
was
drawn
up
in
which
my
friend
withdrew
the
blow
of
his
hand
i
withdrew
the
blow
of
the
bottle
really
now
i
lack
energy
to
explain
it
any
further
xvii
hypocritical
reader
you
draw
your
purity
garments
round
you
you
say
how
very
base
but
i
say
unto
you
remember
how
often
you
have
longed
if
you
are
a
soldier
in
her
majesty
army
for
war
war
that
would
bring
every
form
of
sorrow
to
a
million
and
you
longed
for
all
this
to
happen
because
it
might
bring
your
name
into
the
hypocritical
reader
think
not
too
hardly
of
me
hypocritical
reader
think
what
you
like
of
me
your
hypocrisy
will
alter
nothing
in
telling
you
of
my
vices
i
am
only
telling
you
of
your
own
hypocritical
reader
in
showing
you
my
soul
i
am
showing
you
your
own
hypocritical
reader
exquisitely
hypocritical
reader
you
are
my
brother
i
salute
you
day
passed
over
day
and
my
novel
seemed
an
impossible
task
defeat
glared
at
me
from
every
corner
of
the
room
my
english
was
so
bad
so
thin
stupid
colloquialisms
out
of
joint
with
french
idiom
i
learnt
unusual
words
and
stuck
them
up
here
and
there
they
did
not
mend
the
style
had
been
lost
in
past
failures
i
was
weighed
down
on
every
side
but
i
struggled
to
bring
the
book
somehow
to
a
close
nothing
mattered
to
me
but
this
one
thing
to
put
an
end
to
the
landlady
cheating
and
to
bind
myself
to
remain
at
home
i
entered
into
an
arrangement
with
her
that
she
was
to
supply
me
with
board
and
lodgings
for
three
pounds
a
week
and
henceforth
resisting
all
curzon
street
temptations
i
trudged
home
to
eat
a
chop
i
studied
the
servant
as
one
might
an
insect
under
a
microscope
what
an
admirable
book
she
would
make
but
what
will
the
end
be
if
i
only
knew
the
end
i
saw
poor
miss
nightly
on
the
stairs
and
i
never
wearied
of
talking
to
her
of
her
hopes
and
ambitions
of
the
young
man
she
admired
and
she
used
to
ask
me
about
my
novel
when
my
troubles
lay
too
heavily
upon
me
i
let
her
go
up
to
her
garret
without
a
word
and
remained
at
the
window
wondering
if
i
should
ever
escape
from
cecil
street
if
i
should
ever
be
a
light
in
that
london
long
low
misshapen
that
dark
monumented
stream
flowing
through
the
lean
bridges
what
if
i
were
a
light
in
this
mass
happiness
abides
only
in
the
natural
affections
in
a
home
and
a
sweet
wife
would
she
whom
i
saw
marry
me
how
sweet
she
was
in
her
simple
naturalness
the
joys
she
has
known
have
been
slight
and
pure
not
violent
and
complex
as
mine
ah
she
is
not
for
me
i
am
not
fit
for
her
i
am
too
sullied
for
her
lips
were
i
to
win
her
could
i
be
dutiful

not
the

of

over
for
me
i
yield
my

i
will
not
make
this
leavetaking
more
sorrowful
than
it
is
already
by
afflicting
you
with
advice
and
instruction
how
to
obtain
what
i
have
obtained
i

spoken
bitterly

one

while
drinking
i
would
say
my
last
word
were
it
possible
i
would
be
remembered
by
you
as
a

man
but
i
know
too
well
that
the
young
never
realise
that
the
old
were
not
born
old
farewell
i
shivered
the
cold
air
of
morning
blew
in
my
face
i
closed
the
window
and
sitting
at
the
table
haggard
and
overworn
i
continued
my
novel
the
end
