violet
and
lulu
were
still
alone
upon
the
veranda
where
the
captain
had
left
them
while
he
drove
into
the
village
on
that
first
evening
after
their
from
beautiful
viamede
they
had
now
taken
possession
of
two
standing
close
together
and
were
enjoying
the
quiet
and
an
extended
view
of
the
grounds
and
the
green
fields
and
wooded
hills
that
lay
beyond
for
some
moments
neither
had
spoken
then
violet
broke
the
silence
lulu
i
have
been
thinking
of
that
poor
mcalpine
and
her
daughter
whom
you
met
when
your
father
took
you
and
max
out
to
the
far
west
tell
me
something
about
them
if
you
feel
yes
mamma
vi
they
were
refined
lovable
people
and
i
like
to
think
and
talk
of
them
except
that
it
makes
me
sad
to
think
what
a
hard
trying
life
they
led
and
are
yet
leading
i
yes
my
heart
bleeds
for
them
the
poor
mother
especially
sighed
violet
foully
robbed
of
her
husband
s
love
what
charm
has
life
in
this
world
left
for
her
if
i
were
in
her
place
i
d
just
make
up
my
mind
not
to
care
for
him
or
his
love
and
be
happy
in
loving
my
children
and
being
loved
by
them
exclaimed
lulu
in
indignant
tones
i
d
never
break
my
heart
for
such
a
wretch
he
is
certainly
not
worth
it
was
violet
s
response
ah
there
is
your
father
as
a
carriage
turned
in
at
the
great
gates
opening
upon
the
it
came
swiftly
up
the
drive
halted
at
the
front
entrance
and
the
captain
quickly
alighting
handed
out
a
girlish
figure
clad
in
a
plain
dark
dress
and
hat
miss
mcalpine
my
dear
lulu
it
is
your
old
friend
welcome
my
poor
dear
girl
said
violet
taking
marian
s
hand
in
a
kindly
pressure
and
giving
her
a
kiss
o
marian
marian
what
a
delightful
surprise
was
lulu
s
greeting
as
she
threw
her
arms
about
her
friend
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
just
as
i
meant
it
should
be
the
captain
remarked
with
a
pleased
smile
but
marian
seemed
speechless
with
emotion
clinging
to
lulu
and
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
o
you
poor
dear
lulu
said
gently
patting
and
stroking
her
don
t
cry
so
bitterly
we
will
do
all
we
can
to
make
you
happy
you
must
be
very
tired
with
your
long
journey
but
you
can
rest
now
in
this
sweet
home
of
yes
take
her
up
to
the
spare
room
nearest
your
own
lulu
said
the
captain
and
see
that
she
has
everything
she
and
we
will
have
her
tea
sent
up
to
her
added
violet
she
took
that
in
the
village
my
dear
said
the
captain
and
as
she
is
very
weary
had
better
get
to
bed
as
soon
as
she
can
i
see
that
her
trunk
has
already
been
carried
o
sir
how
kind
how
kind
you
are
to
me
marian
exclaimed
sobbingly
putting
her
hand
into
his
and
lifting
grateful
eyes
to
his
face
ah
my
poor
child
it
would
be
a
great
delight
to
me
could
i
but
relieve
all
your
sorrows
he
returned
in
moved
tones
that
is
beyond
my
power
but
cast
all
your
burdens
on
the
lord
and
he
will
sustain
you
fulfilling
to
you
his
gracious
promise
as
thy
days
so
shall
thy
strength
you
need
rest
do
not
lie
awake
grieving
but
try
to
obey
the
scriptural
injunction
casting
all
your
care
upon
him
for
he
careth
for
o
sir
i
believe
it
marian
responded
in
deeply
grateful
tones
for
otherwise
he
would
never
have
raised
up
such
a
friend
as
you
are
proving
yourself
to
be
how
shall
i
ever
thank
one
who
shows
himself
far
kinder
than
my
own
father
yes
my
dear
girl
my
good
husband
feels
for
you
very
much
as
he
does
for
his
own
children
when
they
are
in
trouble
violet
said
feelingly
as
marian
turned
to
say
to
her
lulu
dear
she
added
try
to
make
sure
that
your
guest
has
everything
that
can
add
to
her
i
will
mamma
vi
lulu
answered
in
pleasant
tones
and
stay
with
marian
only
long
enough
to
see
to
that
added
the
captain
for
her
journey
has
fatigued
her
greatly
and
she
needs
rest
more
than
anything
yes
sir
we
can
wait
till
for
our
talk
lulu
replied
looking
smilingly
up
into
his
face
and
i
ll
come
directly
to
you
so
that
you
will
know
i
have
obeyed
the
that
is
right
you
will
find
me
here
he
returned
oh
what
a
lovely
home
you
have
lulu
exclaimed
marian
glancing
about
her
as
they
went
up
the
stairway
yes
indeed
i
think
we
have
and
i
love
it
dearly
but
not
a
thousandth
part
as
much
as
i
do
the
dear
father
who
made
it
for
us
and
makes
us
so
happy
in
it
this
is
the
room
he
bade
me
bring
you
to
marian
opening
a
door
and
leading
the
way
into
a
large
airy
and
beautifully
furnished
bedroom
oh
how
lovely
how
lovely
exclaimed
marian
ah
it
is
much
too
grand
for
poor
girl
who
has
not
a
dollar
in
the
not
a
bit
said
lulu
in
reply
those
who
have
nothing
need
help
all
the
more
besides
papa
does
not
value
people
for
their
wealth
and
has
never
taught
his
children
to
ah
there
is
your
trunk
i
see
the
men
have
unstrapped
it
now
if
you
are
too
tired
to
get
out
the
things
you
want
for
and
will
give
me
the
key
i
will
do
so
for
you
while
you
sit
here
in
this
and
direct
oh
thank
you
but
i
feel
able
to
wait
on
well
you
shall
do
exactly
as
you
please
returned
lulu
with
a
smile
i
see
the
servants
have
filled
your
pitchers
and
if
you
should
want
anything
that
is
not
here
you
have
only
to
touch
this
knob
which
rings
an
electric
bell
in
the
it
one
push
for
cold
or
two
for
hot
water
or
three
for
the
chambermaid
to
come
to
how
very
nice
and
convenient
exclaimed
marian
lulu
then
explained
about
the
light
saying
she
was
welcome
to
put
it
out
or
leave
it
burning
just
as
she
preferred
and
bidding
her
a
kind
left
the
room
hurrying
down
to
the
veranda
she
found
her
father
and
violet
still
there
sitting
side
by
side
conversing
together
in
rather
subdued
tones
here
i
am
papa
lulu
said
approaching
them
that
is
right
he
responded
and
drew
her
to
a
seat
upon
his
knee
you
saw
that
your
guest
had
every
want
supplied
he
asked
caressing
her
hair
and
cheek
with
his
hand
as
he
spoke
yes
sir
o
papa
tell
me
all
about
it
all
about
what
he
asked
with
a
smile
holding
her
close
and
pressing
a
kiss
upon
her
lips
about
marian
sir
did
you
know
she
was
coming
and
was
it
just
to
get
her
you
drove
into
the
village
one
question
at
a
time
my
child
he
returned
with
an
amused
look
yes
i
knew
she
was
coming
i
had
found
a
letter
from
her
on
my
library
table
telling
me
so
and
reminding
me
of
the
invitation
you
heard
me
give
her
just
before
leaving
minersville
to
apply
to
me
for
help
should
the
time
ever
come
when
she
would
need
a
friend
able
and
willing
to
aid
oh
yes
papa
i
remember
it
and
i
don
t
think
anybody
could
find
a
better
friend
than
my
dear
father
when
in
need
of
well
i
found
the
letter
read
it
to
your
mamma
vi
then
drove
into
the
village
for
marian
leaving
for
you
the
pleasure
of
being
taken
by
surprise
on
seeing
her
return
with
and
a
very
pleasant
surprise
it
was
papa
is
she
going
to
stay
and
oh
what
has
become
of
her
poor
mother
and
the
boys
i
suppose
she
told
you
all
about
them
as
you
drove
back
from
the
village
more
than
two
questions
at
once
this
time
laughed
her
father
i
will
try
to
answer
them
in
turn
she
is
likely
to
stay
with
us
for
the
present
at
least
her
mother
and
all
the
younger
children
except
sandy
are
dead
the
little
ones
dying
of
diphtheria
the
mother
of
grief
and
the
fatigue
from
nursing
them
through
their
illness
sandy
is
working
his
way
with
a
farmer
for
the
present
the
father
attempted
to
force
marian
into
a
match
with
a
mormon
thirty
or
forty
years
older
than
herself
and
she
by
running
away
barely
escaped
a
fate
that
she
esteemed
far
worse
than
oh
poor
thing
cried
lulu
how
glad
i
am
that
i
have
a
father
who
would
never
force
me
to
leave
him
for
anybody
else
clinging
still
closer
to
him
as
she
spoke
never
no
never
my
own
precious
child
he
returned
with
emotion
but
you
are
still
far
too
young
even
to
be
thinking
of
such
a
yes
i
know
that
papa
and
i
m
glad
of
it
i
like
to
be
a
little
girl
that
nobody
wants
to
get
away
from
her
then
we
are
both
papa
is
marian
going
to
live
here
with
us
she
asked
nothing
is
decided
yet
he
replied
but
it
will
depend
upon
circumstances
would
you
wish
it
daughter
she
hesitated
a
little
then
said
if
you
and
mamma
vi
want
her
here
papa
i
would
not
like
to
stand
in
the
way
of
her
having
such
a
sweet
home
s
so
delightful
to
have
our
dear
home
to
ourselves
just
you
and
mamma
vi
and
us
so
your
mamma
and
i
think
he
returned
with
a
gratified
look
and
very
possibly
marian
herself
would
prefer
some
other
plan
for
i
perceive
she
is
of
a
very
independent
disposition
i
have
learned
that
it
is
her
desire
and
purpose
to
earn
her
own
living
and
i
think
the
kindest
thing
i
can
do
will
be
to
help
her
fit
herself
for
whatever
work
she
may
think
best
suited
to
her
talents
and
o
papa
take
her
for
one
of
your
pupils
won
t
you
cried
lulu
in
her
most
eager
coaxing
tones
if
she
wishes
it
and
can
be
located
in
the
near
neighborhood
he
said
oh
i
have
a
thought
exclaimed
lulu
why
can
t
she
live
with
allen
and
susie
at
the
cottage
ah
that
strikes
me
as
a
very
good
suggestion
the
captain
replied
what
do
you
think
of
it
violet
my
dear
i
highly
approve
returned
violet
unless
it
may
crowd
them
too
ah
in
that
case
i
can
easily
add
another
room
or
two
of
them
if
deemed
desirable
he
said
they
might
stand
a
little
crowding
for
a
time
till
they
satisfy
themselves
as
to
their
congeniality
of
even
good
people
sometimes
find
that
they
are
more
comfortable
apart
than
thrown
constantly
together
and
that
having
been
satisfactorily
proved
i
would
make
the
addition
but
we
need
decide
nothing
in
regard
to
these
matters
there
is
the
bell
for
prayers
after
which
lulu
must
go
to
her
nest
and
you
and
i
my
dear
will
i
think
be
ready
for
when
the
short
service
was
over
lulu
bade
violet
then
turning
to
her
father
asked
must
i
say
it
to
you
too
now
papa
no
daughter
he
replied
i
will
step
in
your
room
for
a
moment
when
you
are
about
ready
for
bed
i
suppose
it
would
hardly
do
to
omit
it
on
the
first
night
after
our
return
from
our
wanderings
he
added
smoothing
her
hair
caressingly
as
she
stood
by
his
side
no
indeed
sir
she
returned
with
an
earnestness
that
made
him
smile
and
please
do
not
think
it
will
do
at
any
time
unless
you
are
sick
or
have
some
company
you
can
not
leave
to
give
me
even
a
minute
ah
how
thankful
i
ought
to
be
and
am
that
my
father
is
so
different
from
poor
marian
s
yes
indeed
said
violet
marian
poor
girl
is
greatly
to
be
pitied
so
let
us
all
be
as
kind
to
her
as
yes
mamma
vi
and
i
think
it
will
be
my
place
to
stay
with
her
though
i
shall
be
very
sorry
to
miss
spending
the
afternoon
and
evening
with
the
rest
of
you
at
you
dear
girl
you
shall
do
no
such
thing
returned
violet
with
an
affectionate
smile
into
lulu
s
eyes
i
will
speak
to
mamma
through
the
telephone
morning
and
i
am
sure
she
will
give
marian
a
cordial
invitation
to
make
one
of
the
family
i
do
not
doubt
it
my
dear
said
captain
raymond
but
in
her
fatigue
and
grief
marian
would
i
think
prefer
to
spend
the
day
here
in
rest
and
sleep
nor
will
there
be
any
occasion
for
lulu
to
deny
herself
the
pleasure
of
going
with
the
rest
of
us
to
ion
or
us
the
pleasure
of
having
her
along
again
laying
a
caressing
hand
upon
her
head
and
smiling
down
affectionately
into
the
bright
dark
eyes
lifted
lovingly
to
his
now
go
daughter
to
your
room
i
want
you
to
have
a
good
night
s
rest
that
you
may
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
to
the
chapter
ii
ah
how
i
wish
poor
dear
marian
was
blessed
with
such
a
father
as
mine
lula
said
to
herself
as
she
moved
noiselessly
about
her
room
getting
ready
for
bed
but
i
doubt
if
there
is
another
quite
so
dear
and
mamma
vi
says
hers
was
and
grandma
elsie
seems
to
think
hers
could
not
possibly
be
excelled
the
idea
i
m
as
glad
as
can
be
that
i
wasn
t
born
his
child
though
the
older
he
grows
the
better
and
kinder
he
seems
to
be
and
that
s
the
way
it
ought
to
be
with
all
of
us
papa
says
so
and
i
know
it
s
according
to
bible
teachings
grow
in
grace
and
in
the
knowledge
of
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
it
says
ah
me
there
s
nobody
needs
to
do
that
more
than
you
yourself
you
wilful
lulu
raymond
i
am
glad
you
have
a
father
who
understands
the
business
of
training
you
up
in
the
way
you
should
go
as
well
as
mine
does
and
presently
when
he
came
in
she
turned
to
him
with
a
remark
to
that
effect
if
i
have
succeeded
in
training
my
children
at
all
in
the
right
way
it
is
only
by
the
wisdom
given
me
of
god
in
answer
to
earnest
prayer
for
it
he
replied
with
grave
earnestness
now
my
dear
little
daughter
again
laying
a
hand
tenderly
upon
her
head
the
lord
bless
thee
and
keep
thee
the
lord
make
his
face
to
shine
upon
thee
and
be
gracious
unto
thee
the
lord
lift
up
his
countenance
upon
thee
and
give
thee
dear
papa
thank
you
she
said
lifting
dewy
eyes
to
his
it
is
such
a
beautiful
beautiful
blessing
it
is
indeed
the
blessing
which
the
lord
directed
moses
to
give
to
aaron
and
his
sons
to
use
in
blessing
the
children
of
israel
adding
and
they
shall
put
my
name
upon
the
children
of
israel
and
i
will
bless
now
again
daughter
get
to
bed
and
to
sleep
as
quickly
as
you
lulu
obeyed
and
her
head
had
scarcely
more
than
touched
the
pillow
before
her
senses
were
lost
in
sound
sleep
from
which
she
did
not
awake
till
just
as
the
sun
appeared
above
the
oh
what
a
lovely
morning
everything
looking
so
beautiful
within
and
without
she
exclaimed
to
herself
glancing
around
the
handsomely
furnished
room
then
out
at
the
beautiful
grounds
ah
i
want
a
morning
stroll
with
my
dear
father
and
with
the
words
she
sprang
from
the
bed
and
began
a
hasty
but
neat
toilet
but
first
she
laid
her
bible
open
on
the
that
she
might
commit
a
verse
or
more
to
memory
as
she
worked
then
a
few
moments
were
spent
on
her
knees
giving
thanks
for
god
s
protecting
care
over
her
and
hers
during
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
the
many
many
blessings
of
her
lot
in
life
and
the
hope
of
eternal
life
through
the
righteousness
and
atoning
blood
of
christ
confessing
her
sins
asking
forgiveness
for
jesus
sake
and
help
to
love
him
more
and
serve
him
better
grace
still
slept
soundly
as
lulu
discovered
on
peeping
in
at
the
open
door
communicating
with
her
own
room
polly
woke
and
called
for
a
cracker
according
to
her
custom
lulu
gave
her
one
told
her
to
be
silent
and
not
disturb
tired
sleepers
then
passed
quietly
out
to
the
hall
and
to
marian
s
door
where
she
stood
listening
till
satisfied
that
no
movement
was
going
on
within
that
room
then
seeing
her
father
passing
out
of
his
into
the
hall
she
ran
to
him
was
welcomed
with
a
smile
and
a
kiss
slipped
her
hand
into
his
and
they
went
down
the
stairs
together
have
you
had
anything
to
eat
he
asked
adding
it
will
be
more
than
an
hour
yet
before
we
are
called
to
breakfast
and
that
will
make
too
long
a
fast
from
the
time
you
must
have
left
your
no
sir
i
haven
t
she
replied
shall
i
call
for
a
glass
of
milk
for
you
and
one
for
myself
suppose
instead
we
take
a
basket
and
go
out
to
the
strawberry
bed
how
would
you
like
that
he
asked
oh
ever
so
much
papa
she
exclaimed
delightedly
and
might
we
not
gather
some
for
breakfast
too
mamma
vi
and
the
rest
will
enjoy
them
as
well
as
you
and
i
entirely
approve
of
the
suggestion
he
returned
and
they
set
off
together
for
the
strawberry
patch
it
was
a
large
one
supplied
with
an
abundance
of
the
finest
varieties
the
vines
now
loaded
with
delicious
fruit
just
in
prime
condition
for
eating
oh
how
beautiful
they
are
cried
lulu
so
many
too
and
so
nicely
arranged
and
trained
that
they
don
t
get
any
sand
at
all
on
them
and
so
large
that
it
won
t
take
long
to
fill
our
basket
no
not
many
minutes
gather
and
eat
all
you
wish
and
we
will
fill
the
basket
thank
you
sir
she
said
and
hastened
to
avail
herself
of
the
permission
for
some
minutes
she
was
too
busy
to
talk
but
at
length
when
the
filling
of
the
basket
began
she
broke
the
silence
with
a
question
papa
did
marian
tell
you
how
she
escaped
from
minersville
yes
he
replied
and
now
you
want
me
to
tell
you
i
suppose
oh
yes
sir
if
you
i
will
tell
you
something
about
it
but
let
you
get
the
particulars
from
marian
herself
my
agent
short
was
a
good
friend
to
the
poor
girl
supplied
her
with
funds
and
whatever
else
she
needed
took
her
by
night
to
a
station
some
miles
distant
on
the
railroad
bought
her
a
ticket
had
her
trunk
checked
put
her
on
board
an
eastern
train
and
watched
it
out
of
and
she
travelled
all
the
rest
of
the
way
alone
papa
yes
as
far
as
union
where
i
met
her
with
my
i
think
she
was
very
brave
papa
but
anything
was
better
than
the
fate
she
would
have
had
if
she
had
stayed
where
that
wicked
cruel
father
of
hers
could
have
done
what
he
pleased
with
her
oh
how
glad
and
thankful
i
am
that
god
gave
me
such
a
good
kind
father
and
i
that
you
are
mine
he
returned
with
a
loving
look
into
her
beaming
eyes
it
speaks
ill
indeed
for
mormonism
that
it
can
so
harden
the
heart
against
those
who
should
be
regarded
with
the
tenderest
affection
there
we
have
filled
our
basket
and
now
we
will
go
back
to
the
the
rang
just
as
they
stepped
into
the
veranda
violet
was
there
with
the
three
younger
children
morning
greetings
were
exchanged
then
all
repaired
to
the
i
think
our
weary
young
guest
is
still
sleeping
violet
said
i
knocked
softly
at
her
door
and
listened
for
several
minutes
but
could
hear
no
sound
so
thought
it
best
to
let
her
sleep
on
and
give
her
her
breakfast
when
she
wakes
of
quite
right
my
dear
returned
the
captain
as
he
lifted
baby
ned
to
his
high
chair
then
seated
himself
he
asked
a
blessing
upon
their
food
and
the
meal
began
they
were
the
usual
cheerful
little
family
party
chatting
pleasantly
among
themselves
while
they
ate
as
they
rose
from
the
table
violet
said
i
think
i
will
go
to
the
telephone
and
have
a
little
chat
with
mamma
while
the
servants
are
and
may
i
go
with
you
the
captain
asked
with
a
smile
i
shall
be
happy
to
have
you
sir
she
returned
with
a
laughing
look
up
into
his
face
the
children
are
welcome
to
come
too
if
they
at
ion
the
family
were
about
leaving

when
the

it
was
answered
by
edward

the
reply

sweet
tones
no

exclaimed
rosie
while
edward
stepped
aside
and
their
mother
took
the
place
he
vacated
what

she
asked
and
all
listened
intently
for

she
replied
and
turning
to
her
father
shall

said

turned
away
from
the
telephone

send
a
servant

the
captain
replied
i
told
her
last
night
to
lie
and
sleep
as
late
this
morning
as
she
would
ring
for
her
breakfast
when
she
was
ready
to
eat
it
and
it
should
be
carried
up
to
her
ah

and
then
we
will
have

on
coming
down
nearly
an
hour
later
marian
found
the
family
gathered
upon
the
front
veranda
the
captain
rose
on
her
appearance
and
gallantly
handed
her
to
a
seat
remarking
that
she
was
looking
much
better
and
brighter
than
on
her
arrival
the
previous
evening
yes
sir
she
said
and
i
feel
far
better
i
was
very
weary
with
my
long
journey
what
a
very
big
country
america
is
but
i
slept
well
and
am
almost
rested
just
then
a
carriage
was
seen
to
turn
in
at
the
gates
opening
upon
the
ned
greeted
its
approach
with
a
shout
of
delight
gan
ma

i
the
next
minute
the
carriage
had
drawn
up
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
the
captain
was
assisting
his
guests
to
alight
and
bidding
them
heartily
welcome
cousin
ronald
waiting
only
to
greet
violet
turned
to
the
young
stranger
guest
and
grasping
her
hand
said
with
emotion
i
need
ask
no
questions
for
that
bonny
winsome
face
tells
plainer
than
any
words
that
you
are
my
cousin
janet
s
marian
gazed
at
him
for
a
moment
in
dumb
astonishment
then
a
glad
surprise
lighted
up
her
face
a
kinsman
of
my
dear
mother
she
exclaimed
yes
my
bonny
lass
did
you
never
hear
her
speak
of
her
cousin
ronald
lilburn

held
into
that
of
travilla
yes

must
be
permitted
to
claim
you
as
our
own
dear
girl
grandma
elsie
said
in
tender
tones
and
with
an
affectionate
caress
then
turning
to
her
children
rosie
and
walter
she
said
this
is
your
cousin
then
mine
also
mamma
exclaimed
violet
ah
marian
i
am
glad
to
know
there
is
such
a
tie
between
us
taking
the
young
girl
s
hand
in
hers
and
holding
it
for
a
moment
in
a
kindly
pressure
i
also
for
if
related
to
my
wife
you
are
to
me
too
the
captain
said
laying
a
hand
affectionately
upon
the
young
girl
s
shoulder
then
the
younger
ones
greeted
her
warmly
in
turn
dinsmore
shook
hands
with
her
in
a
kind
grandfatherly
way
saying
that
she
must
no
longer
feel
herself
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
but
that
the
god
of
her
fathers
had
guided
her
to
an
among
her
own
kith
and
kin
marian
seemed
overwhelmed
with
joy
and
gratitude
by
the
sudden
glad
change
in
her
condition
laughing
and
crying
hysterically
in
turn
but
under
the
kind
ministrations
of
her
newly
found
relatives
soon
recovered
her
composure
and
was
able
to
answer
coherently
the
many
questions
cousin
ronald
had
to
ask
concerning
her
parents
and
brothers
his
manner
increased
in
gentleness
and
tenderness
as
he
learned
of
her
many
and
recent
bereavements
and
the
cruel
treatment
received
at
the
hands
of
her
unnatural
father
lilburn
s
brow
darkened
as
he
listened
ah
to
think
o
my
ain
bonny
cousin
throwing
hersel
awa
upon
sic
a
beast
o
a
mon
he
muttered
between
his
set
teeth
then
aloud
to
marian
dinna
fash
yersel
lassie
the
lord
has
blessed
your
cousin
ronald
wi
abundance
o
this
worl
s
gude
sons
too
and
one
married
daughter
but
no
single
one
now
the
two
that
were
once
the
pride
and
joy
o
his
heart
having
been
long
since
called
to
the
father
s
house
on
high
and
if
it
so
pleases
you
he
will
be
glad
to
take
you
in
the
place
of
one
of
how
very
kind
you
are
sir
she
exclaimed
with
starting
tears
i
can
not
consent
to
be
a
burden
to
any
one
but
will
gladly
take
help
to
fit
myself
for
some
useful
employment
by
which
i
can
earn
my
daily
and
that
you
shall
have
my
dear
lass
he
said
emphatically
but
we
need
not
settle
anything
their
cousin
elsie
remarked
then
told
marian
of
the
family
gathering
to
be
held
at
ion
that
afternoon
adding
a
warm
invitation
to
her
to
make
one
of
the
company
marian
accepted
with
thanks
then
coloring
and
hesitating
said
she
feared
she
had
nothing
to
wear
which
would
be
suitable
for
such
an
occasion
my
dear
girl
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
troubled
with
any
such
fears
elsie
replied
in
gentle
reassuring
accents
it
is
only
a
family
gathering
and
the
dress
you
are
now
wearing
will
be
quite
surely
surely
lassie
it
strikes
me
as
far
from
unbecoming
cousin
ronald
said
regarding
her
and
her
apparel
with
critical
eyes
and
if
any
in
the
company
think
ill
o
e
dress
let
him
or
her
forget
it
in
gazing
upon
the
bonny
face
above
i
think
you
need
not
feel
ashamed
of
it
or
fear
unfavorable
criticism
my
dear
girl
added
violet
no
dress
is
but
a
secondary
matter
in
the
connection
so
far
as
i
know
said
the
captain
and
rosie
and
lulu
added
their
assurance
to
the
same
effect
then
i
shall
go
with
pleasure
and
try
not
to
think
of
the
dress
at
all
returned
marian
with
a
look
of
relief
walter
ever
ready
for
a
story
had
been
eagerly
watching
his
opportunity
and
now
earnestly
requested
of
marian
a
detailed
account
of
her
escape
from
minersville
she
complied
and
gave
the
facts
in
a
way
that
all
her
hearers
found
exceedingly
interesting
at
the
conclusion
of
her
narrative
the
ion
callers
departed
and
after
dinner
the
whole
woodburn
family
including
their
guest
followed
marian
s
eyes
were
bright
with
happiness
in
the
discovery
that
the
captain
and
lulu
both
of
whom
she
had
learned
to
dearly
love
in
the
days
of
her
acquaintance
with
them
in
the
far
west
were
in
some
sort
connected
with
her
and
disposed
to
treat
her
as
a
near
and
valued
relative
also
that
through
them
she
had
come
upon
others
actually
of
her
mother
s
kith
and
kin
and
disposed
to
take
her
in
among
them
and
treat
her
as
one
of
themselves
ah
what
a
sudden
and
delightful
change
from
the
lonely
and
forlorn
condition
which
had
been
hers
but
the
day
before
she
greatly
enjoyed
the
short
drive
to
ion
the
warm
welcome
received
there
by
herself
as
well
as
the
others
the
pleasant
kindly
greetings
of
the
different
members
of
the
various
family
connections
all
of
whom
though
many
of
them
were
not
actually
even
distantly
related
to
her
met
her
with
the
greatest
cordiality
and
seemed
deeply
interested
in
the
story
of
her
past
and
her
prospects
for
the
future
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
young
girls
from
the
oaks
with
lora
howard
also
and
evelyn
leland
with
all
of
whom
she
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
in
pleasant
chat
while
wandering
about
the
beautiful
grounds
and
boating
on
the
lovely
lakelet
while
the
young
people
strolled
over
the
grounds
the
older
ones
sat
conversing
together
in
the
veranda
much
of
the
talk
was
of
marian
and
what
could
be
done
to
help
her
to
a
happy
and
useful
life
it
soon
became
apparent
that
any
one
of
them
was
ready
to
offer
her
a
home
captain
raymond
more
than
willing
to
take
her
into
the
number
of
his
pupils
and
lilburn
really
anxious
to
bear
all
the
expense
of
her
clothing
and
education
if
she
will
accept
me
as
her
teacher
the
education
need
cost
but
little
remarked
captain
raymond
and
i
said
elsie
travilla
must
claim
the
privilege
of
supplying
at
least
a
part
of
her
clothing
for
as
my
dear
mother
s
relative
she
seems
very
near
to
and
what
is
left
for
me
to
do
asked
lilburn
with
a
comical
look
of
chagrin
and
dismay
why
sir
you
might
supply
suggested
zoe
or
settle
a
few
thousands
upon
her
so
that
she
need
not
feel
absolutely
penniless
added
edward
ah
ha
ah
ha
um
hm
that
s
no
so
bad
an
idea
cousin
returned
the
old
gentleman
with
a
humorous
look
and
smile
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
our
bonny
lassie
may
not
be
averse
to
receiving
it
from
a
kinsman
near
a
clansman
true
though
the
kin
be
not
so
near
as
one
might
yet
if
you
adopt
her
that
need
make
but
little
difference
edward
laughingly
returned
quite
true
sir
and
whether
that
is
done
or
no
will
rest
wi
the
sweet
lassie
hersel
said
the
old
gentleman
relapsing
into
his
scottish
brogue
she
is
one
any
man
might
be
proud
to
call
his
so
we
all
think
said
elsie
leland
and
lester
and
i
would
be
glad
to
give
her
a
home
at
fairview
she
would
make
a
desirable
companion
for
evelyn
we
she
would
do
quite
as
well
for
ella
at
the
roselands
wouldn
t
she
cal
said
arthur
conly
with
a
humorous
look
at
his
elder
brother
not
a
doubt
of
it
for
ourselves
too
for
that
matter
laughed
calhoun
or
for
us
at
the
oaks
remarked
the
younger
horace
dinsmore
and
his
sister
lacey
added
or
for
us
at
the
evidently
she
is
in
no
danger
of
finding
herself
homeless
remarked
the
father
of
the
last
two
with
a
smile
no
indeed
not
while
her
older
cousin
elsie
has
one
or
more
to
offer
her
added
the
sweet
voice
of
his
eldest
daughter
i
propose
that
some
of
us
take
her
into
the
city
morning
and
buy
for
her
whatever
may
be
needed
to
supply
her
with
a
wardrobe
equal
to
that
of
any
one
of
our
own
a
very
good
thought
cousin
said
lilburn
and
with
your
leave
i
shall
make
one
of
that
party
and
might
it
not
be
well
to
take
the
lass
herself
with
us
and
consult
her
own
taste
to
supplement
the
good
judgment
of
yourself
and
any
of
the
other
ladies
who
may
care
to
accompany
us
and
give
her
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
city
too
said
zoe
if
she
is
sufficiently
rested
from
her
long
and
wearisome
journey
to
enjoy
after
a
little
more
talk
it
was
fully
decided
that
the
trip
to
the
city
and
the
shopping
should
be
undertaken
on
the
morrow
and
marian
invited
to
accompany
them
or
not
as
might
suit
her
inclination
chapter
iii
the
drew
near
and
the
young
folks
came
trooping
in
and
joined
their
elders
on
the
veranda
all
had
presently
found
seats
and
were
chatting
gayly
with
their
elders
or
among
themselves
marian
alone
occupying
a
chair
close
by
lilburn
s
side
was
a
silent
though
interested
listener
until
captain
raymond
turning
to
her
asked
in
his
pleasant
tones
how
she
liked
ion
o
sir
she
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
it
is
lovely
lovely
but
not
any
more
beautiful
than
ah
i
am
glad
you
like
woodburn
also
because
i
want
it
to
be
one
of
your
homes
and
its
one
of
the
places
where
you
may
get
such
an
education
as
i
know
you
want
do
you
think
you
could
content
yourself
with
me
for
a
tutor
o
sir
how
kind
you
are
to
me
she
exclaimed
with
tears
of
joy
in
her
eyes
if
you
will
accept
me
as
a
pupil
i
shall
strive
most
earnestly
to
do
credit
to
your
teaching
but
ah
i
fear
you
will
find
me
but
a
dull
scholar
and
teaching
me
much
too
heavy
a
tax
upon
your
time
and
never
fear
he
returned
pleasantly
i
incline
to
the
opinion
that
i
shall
enjoy
having
one
or
more
pupils
i
think
it
will
add
interest
to
my
work
and
take
scarcely
more
of
my
while
this
little
conversation
was
being
carried
on
cousin
ronald
had
caught
a
very
wishful
entreating
look
from
walter
to
which
he
had
nodded
a
smiling
assent
and
now
the
loud
warble
of
a
bird
seemingly
right
in
their
midst
caught
every
eye
and
ear
and
all
eyes
turned
toward
the
spot
from
which
the
sound
seemed
to
come
why
where
is
the
birdie
i
don
t
see
it
exclaimed
little
elsie
as
the
sounds
suddenly
ceased
i
spect
it
flewed
away
cried
little
ned
sending
quick
glances
from
side
to
side
and
overhead
walter
s
face
was
full
of
suppressed
delight
but
he
dodged
suddenly
putting
up
his
hand
to
drive
away
a
bee
that
seemed
to
be
circling
about
his
head
buzzing
now
at
one
ear
now
at
the
other
then
recalling
the
probable
cause
he
laughed
aloud
others
of
the
company
joining
in
with
him
marian
too
had
heard
the
buzzing
and
was
looking
up
and
around
for
a
bee
when
a
peep
peep
peep
close
at
hand
made
her
look
down
and
around
upon
the
floor
at
her
feet
her
countenance
expressed
surprise
and
bewilderment
that
no
chick
was
in
sight
peep
peep
peep
came
again
seemingly
from
her
pocket
or
among
the
folds
of
her
she
rose
hastily
to
her
feet
shook
her
skirts
then
thrust
her
hand
into
her
pocket
why
where
is
it
she
asked
looking
somewhat
alarmed
why
it
seems
to
have
come
to
me
grace
raymond
exclaimed
as
the
peep
peep
peep
was
heard
again
apparently
from
among
her
skirts
and
she
too
sprang
to
her
feet
and
shook
herself
with
a
downward
glance
at
them
and
a
little
nervous
laugh
she
was
near
her
father
and
he
drew
her
to
his
knee
saying
softly
don
t
be
alarmed
darling
for
you
know
there
is
really
nothing
walter
can
t
you
hunt
up
that
chick
asked
edward
looking
gravely
at
his
little
brother
think
how
bad
it
would
be
for
the
poor
little
thing
if
somebody
should
accidentally
tramp
upon
why
i
shan
t
need
to
hunt
it
exclaimed
walter
as
the
peep
peep
peep
seemed
to
come
from
his
pocket
he
thrust
his
hand
into
it
and
sprang
to
his
feet
as
he
spoke
but
at
that
instant
a
loud
and
furious
barking
just
around
the
corner
of
the
veranda
attracted
every
one
s
attention
down
sir
down
cried
a
rough
voice
i
m
neither
thief
nor
another
furious
bark
then
a
low
growl
came
in
response
and
baby
ned
ran
to
his
father
with
a
frightened
cry
o
papa
i
s
fraid
doggie
bite
no
no
neddie
boy
papa
won
t
let
him
harm
his
baby
the
captain
said
taking
the
little
trembler
in
his
arms
while
grace
still
kept
close
at
his
side
the
barking
suddenly
ceased
nor
was
the
rough
voice
heard
again
and
walter
running
to
the
corner
whence
the
sounds
had
proceeded
announced
with
a
merry
laugh
that
neither
man
nor
dog
was
in
sight
the
chicken
and
the
bee
seem
to
have
gone
too
he
added
as
he
came
running
back
and
there
s
the
with
that
all
rose
and
repaired
to
the
there
marian
was
seated
beside
lulu
the
captain
next
grace
on
his
other
side
and
violet
and
her
two
little
ones
opposite
them
a
blessing
was
asked
and
the
plates
were
filled
then
a
lull
in
the
conversation
was
broken
by
a
rough
voice
saying
in
a
sarcastic
tone
now
ef
you
folks
was
as
perlite
and
hospitable
as
we
are
out
west
you
d
invite
this
stranger
to
take
a
seat
among
ye
and
have
a
cup
o
coffee
and
something
to
almost
every
one
looked
startled
and
all
eyes
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds
which
seemed
to
come
from
behind
edward
s
chair
an
invisible
speaker
as
might
have
been
expected
laughed
violet
show
yourself
sir
take
a
seat
at
the
table
and
you
shall
be
helped
to
all
you
wish
of
anything
and
everything
upon
it
said
edward
glancing
about
as
if
in
search
of
the
unexpected
intruder
show
myself
humph
you
must
be
if
you
can
t
see
a
man
o
my
size
returned
the
voice
perhaps
so
sir
replied
edward
turning
a
knowing
and
amused
look
upon
cousin
ronald
and
i
think
i
do
see
you
very
well
but
have
you
been
neglected
your
plate
and
cup
look
to
me
to
be
well
my
plate
and
cup
sir
exclaimed
the
voice
in
tones
of
indignant
surprise
pray
where
are
they
directly
in
front
of
cousin
ronald
as
we
his
relatives
are
accustomed
to
call
why
laddie
i
had
thought
you
a
hospitable
host
and
now
would
you
rob
me
o
my
supper
which
you
have
just
bestowed
upon
me
and
give
it
to
an
unknown
exclaimed
lilburn
in
astonishment
and
indignation
it
does
look
very
inhospitable
ned
something
to
make
me
blush
for
my
grandson
remarked
dinsmore
with
a
slight
smile
well
well
cried
the
rough
voice
it
shall
never
be
said
of
me
that
i
set
a
family
together
by
the
ears
so
i
ll
leave
a
shuffling
sound
followed
as
of
some
one
moving
across
the
room
in
the
direction
of
a
door
opening
upon
the
veranda
then
all
was
quiet
every
head
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
as
they
ceased
there
was
a
general
laugh
but
the
expression
of
marian
s
countenance
was
perplexed
and
slightly
alarmed
was
it
she
asked
with
a
slight
tremble
in
her
voice
nothing
alarming
my
dear
replied
grandma
elsie
in
her
sweet
gentle
tones
we
have
a
ventriloquist
with
us
that
is
all
and
he
not
infrequently
kindly
amuses
us
with
an
exhibition
of
his
ah
and
it
is
cousin
ronald
marian
returned
inquiringly
and
with
a
glance
into
lilburn
s
genial
face
returning
her
smile
ah
little
cousin
you
seem
to
be
as
good
at
guessing
as
if
you
were
a
born
yankee
he
said
pleasantly
but
it
can
hardly
be
that
you
are
the
only
one
she
said
as
with
sudden
recollection
captain
raymond
turning
to
him
i
think
i
understand
now
about
some
puzzling
things
that
occurred
while
you
were
at
our
house
year
before
last
you
too
are
a
ventriloquist
are
you
not
no
my
dear
girl
by
no
means
he
replied
then
i
have
not
as
i
believed
found
a
solution
of
the
mystery
she
remarked
reflectively
but
i
think
some
one
else
who
was
there
must
have
been
a
ventriloquist
for
i
know
not
how
else
to
account
for
some
things
that
occurred
at
minersville
when
you
were
there
the
and
dog
heard
by
four
of
us
but
not
seen
the
voice
speaking
from
the
tree
and
the
porch
roof
that
made
riggs
so
angry
and
all
that
occurred
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
as
you
americans
call
and
that
was
doubtless
the
work
of
a
ventriloquist
acknowledged
the
captain
in
a
pleasant
tone
but
i
can
not
claim
any
talent
in
that
then
who
could
it
have
been
she
said
with
a
puzzled
look
ah
perhaps
the
english
gentleman
or
his
son
i
remember
they
were
often
there
conversing
with
you
and
master
captain
raymond
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
reply
to
that
remark
and
other
subjects
of
conversation
were
presently
introduced
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
all
repaired
to
the
veranda
or
the
grounds
and
cousin
ronald
drew
marian
aside
for
a
little
private
chat
tell
me
about
your
brother
lass
he
said
is
he
happy
suited
with
his
employment
think
you
marian
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
then
said
frankly
poor
sandy
longs
for
a
good
education
sir
but
is
willing
to
work
hard
and
long
for
the
means
to
pay
his
way
in
school
and
he
is
a
good
industrious
lad
never
a
better
one
sir
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
make
himself
useful
and
helpful
to
our
dear
mother
and
to
me
he
is
as
industrious
and
painstaking
a
lad
as
ever
was
seen
i
am
proud
indeed
of
my
only
one
of
my
mother
s
children
besides
myself
that
is
ah
he
should
have
must
have
help
said
cousin
ronald
leaning
meditatively
on
his
cane
marian
lass
turning
inquiringly
to
her
he
wouldna
refuse
it
frae
his
own
auld
kinsman
o
cousin
ronald
could
you
it
in
your
kind
heart
to
help
him
to
it
bless
you
for
it
sir
it
would
be
the
making
of
the
dear
lad
and
should
it
please
the
lord
to
spare
his
life
i
am
very
sure
you
may
trust
him
to
repay
every
cent
of
your
outlay
for
him
marian
cried
with
starting
tears
and
clasping
her
hands
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
indeed
could
i
and
will
i
lass
said
the
old
gentleman
taking
and
pencil
from
his
pocket
give
me
his
address
and
i
will
write
to
him
he
wrote
it
down
at
marian
s
dictation
then
restoring
book
and
pencil
to
his
pocket
now
tell
me
of
the
dear
mother
lassie
he
said
in
low
feeling
tones
she
loved
the
lord
served
him
and
died
trusting
in
his
atoning
blood
she
did
she
did
sir
sobbed
the
bereaved
girl
it
was
an
awful
sorrowful
life
she
led
from
the
time
that
cruel
mormon
missionary
deceived
and
cajoled
my
father
into
belief
in
the
wicked
doctrines
and
practices
of
that
contrary
to
the
teachings
of
god
s
own
holy
she
trusted
in
jesus
and
at
the
last
was
full
of
joy
that
she
was
about
to
leave
this
world
to
dwell
forever
with
him
in
that
blessed
land
where
sin
and
sorrow
never
enter
it
was
a
terrible
loss
to
me
but
not
for
worlds
would
i
bring
her
back
hard
hard
though
it
be
to
live
without
her
dear
love
and
yes
dear
lass
but
life
is
short
and
if
you
trust
in
the
lord
and
his
righteousness
you
and
she
will
spend
a
blessed
eternity
together
at
his
right
hand
but
i
will
leave
for
the
present
he
added
for
evidently
cousin
elsie
is
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
have
a
bit
of
private
chat
with
you
with
that
the
old
gentleman
rose
and
moved
away
and
their
lovely
lady
hostess
took
his
place
by
marian
s
side
she
talked
to
the
young
girl
in
the
kindliest
manner
saying
that
she
must
let
her
be
as
a
mother
to
her
now
while
she
was
so
young
as
to
need
a
mother
s
loving
care
and
you
must
let
us
your
own
relatives
provide
all
needful
things
for
you
until
you
are
educated
and
fitted
to
take
care
of
yourself
which
we
will
endeavor
to
do
remembering
that
all
we
have
is
the
lord
s
intrusted
to
us
to
be
used
in
his
service
a
part
of
which
is
helping
others
to
fit
themselves
for
o
cousin
how
kind
how
kind
you
and
all
these
relatives
are
exclaimed
the
young
girl
with
emotion
i
can
not
deny
that
i
am
too
proud
enjoy
as
perhaps
i
under
such
obligations
but
i
will
and
do
accept
it
hoping
that
my
heavenly
father
will
some
day
enable
me
to
the
kindness
that
could
never
be
the
moneyed
part
of
the
that
is
right
dear
girl
elsie
said
pressing
tenderly
the
hand
she
had
taken
into
hers
and
to
begin
with
i
want
to
see
that
you
are
provided
with
clothing
as
good
and
abundant
as
have
the
other
young
members
of
our
family
connection
cousin
ronald
and
i
and
one
or
more
of
my
daughters
expect
to
go
to
the
city
and
make
purchases
for
you
and
you
shall
accompany
us
and
let
your
own
taste
and
judgment
be
used
in
the
selection
of
dresses
and
other
needed
articles
or
stay
behind
and
trust
to
our
taste
as
you
may
prefer
however
you
need
not
decide
that
question
the
captain
and
violet
insist
that
you
shall
go
back
to
woodburn
with
them
and
we
will
call
at
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
to
hear
what
your
decision
is
and
take
you
with
us
if
you
care
to
dear
cousin
elsie
i
don
t
know
how
to
thank
you
marian
exclaimed
with
emotion
you
and
indeed
all
these
relatives
are
so
wonderfully
kind
to
me
one
who
has
not
the
shadow
of
a
claim
upon
no
that
is
a
mistake
of
yours
dear
girl
elsie
returned
the
bible
bids
to
whom
god
has
given
more
or
less
of
this
world
s
that
they
do
good
that
they
be
rich
in
good
works
ready
to
distribute
willing
to
communicate
laying
up
in
store
for
themselves
a
good
foundation
against
the
time
to
come
that
they
may
lay
hold
on
eternal
but
i
will
not
detain
you
longer
for
i
would
have
you
enjoy
the
company
of
our
dear
young
folks
to
the
i
enjoy
it
greatly
but
not
more
than
your
own
dear
sweet
cousin
returned
the
young
girl
gazing
into
grandma
elsie
s
beautiful
eyes
with
her
own
full
of
grateful
happy
tears
you
have
enjoyed
yourself
grandma
elsie
asked
in
tones
of
tender
solicitude
oh
very
very
much
was
the
quick
earnest
rejoinder
i
never
before
had
just
such
a
day
in
all
my
life
though
my
mother
used
to
tell
me
of
similar
ones
in
hers
for
her
near
kith
and
kin
were
richer
and
of
higher
station
than
my
father
were
that
she
married
him
she
ended
with
a
sigh
she
married
for
love
i
suppose
elsie
said
inquiringly
yes
sighed
marian
for
love
but
as
time
proved
far
more
than
half
the
love
was
on
her
it
may
be
that
love
may
turn
to
that
which
is
little
better
than
ah
was
it
so
bad
as
that
elsie
asked
with
a
grieved
look
into
the
sad
eyes
of
her
young
relative
if
so
one
can
not
blame
you
if
you
have
ceased
to
love
one
so
heartless
as
he
has
shown
himself
to
jesus
said
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
and
such
are
the
fruits
of
mormonism
returned
marian
the
fruits
brought
forth
in
the
lives
of
those
who
follow
its
hellish
teachings
is
that
too
hard
a
word
cousin
it
teaches
lying
polygamy
unscriptural
horrible
one
of
which
is
to
be
found
anywhere
in
god
s
own
holy
word
oh
i
thank
the
lord
that
i
have
escaped
out
of
their
hands
you
well
may
and
i
am
very
thankful
for
you
my
poor
dear
cousin
elsie
returned
in
tones
of
heartfelt
sympathy
but
just
then
rosie
came
and
asked
if
marian
could
not
be
spared
to
take
part
in
some
games
the
young
people
were
about
to
begin
an
hour
later
the
woodburn
carriage
was
in
waiting
at
the
veranda
steps
and
the
captain
and
his
party
entered
it
and
were
driven
home
on
their
arrival
there
gracie
and
the
little
ones
went
directly
to
bed
and
while
violet
was
engaged
in
attendance
upon
them
the
captain
lulu
and
marian
had
the
veranda
to
themselves
here
marian
take
this
big
said
lulu
drawing
one
forward
and
give
me
your
hat
i
m
going
to
hang
mine
on
the
rack
in
the
hall
and
may
just
as
well
take
yours
too
and
papa
s
holding
out
her
hand
for
his
which
he
gave
her
with
an
approving
smile
as
he
seated
himself
upon
a
settee
near
the
chair
she
had
given
marian
the
next
minute
she
was
with
them
again
nestling
close
to
his
side
her
arm
around
his
neck
his
about
her
waist
her
eyes
gazing
up
with
ardent
affection
into
his
while
her
pretty
little
white
hand
stroked
his
face
lovingly
and
toyed
with
his
beard
he
was
talking
to
marian
and
hardly
showed
consciousness
of
lulu
s
caresses
except
that
he
stroked
her
hair
patted
her
cheek
and
pressed
his
lips
absently
once
or
twice
to
it
or
her
forehead
marian
s
eyes
filled
at
the
sight
and
she
had
much
ado
to
keep
her
voice
steady
while
answering
his
queries
in
regard
to
the
growth
and
prosperity
of
minersville
its
schools
churches
and
public
works
ah
what
bliss
to
have
such
a
dear
and
kind
was
the
thought
in
her
heart
she
expressed
that
thought
to
lulu
when
they
bade
after
going
upstairs
indeed
it
is
was
lulu
s
earnest
rejoinder
and
i
wish
yours
and
all
fathers
were
like
mine
he
isn
t
foolishly
indulgent
all
his
children
know
they
must
yield
ready
and
cheerful
obedience
whenever
he
gives
an
order
but
it
is
always
so
evidently
for
our
good
and
so
pleasantly
spoken
unless
we
are
showing
ourselves
wilful
and
stubborn
that
it
is
not
at
all
hard
for
any
but
a
very
bad
contrary
i
have
sometimes
been
i
m
ashamed
to
how
blessed
you
are
lulu
sighed
marian
but
she
added
with
a
look
of
surprise
you
did
not
bid
him
and
i
could
not
help
wondering
at
the
ah
that
was
because
he
will
come
presently
to
my
room
for
just
a
few
minutes
chat
and
a
kiss
lulu
said
with
a
joyous
smile
mamma
my
own
mother
used
to
do
it
but
she
is
gone
now
and
to
our
great
joy
papa
takes
her
place
in
that
i
would
not
miss
it
for
anything
so
and
pleasant
dreams
for
i
must
you
dear
sweet
girl
marian
said
folding
her
arms
about
lulu
for
an
instant
and
kissing
her
with
warmth
of
affection
i
love
you
and
my
now
sainted
mother
loved
you
too
but
oh
what
would
i
not
give
for
such
a
father
as
yours
chapter
iv
well
how
many
of
you
would
like
to
go
to
the
city
the
captain
asked
in
pleasant
tones
the
next
morning
at
the
you
my
dear
looking
at
violet
no
thank
you
sir
i
think
not
as
i
have
a
number
of
matters
to
attend
to
at
home
and
will
not
be
needed
to
assist
in
the
shopping
as
mamma
and
sister
elsie
are
both
going
probably
evelyn
also
as
some
dresses
are
to
be
bought
for
you
will
go
marian
he
said
inquiringly
turning
to
her
as
he
spoke
you
will
want
to
exercise
your
own
taste
and
judgment
in
the
selection
of
articles
of
dress
at
least
so
i
presume
as
such
is
the
case
with
my
eldest
daughter
he
concluded
with
a
smiling
glance
at
lulu
and
she
i
dare
say
wants
to
be
of
the
if
you
are
going
papa
lulu
replied
otherwise
i
d
rather
stay
at
home
if
i
you
may
do
exactly
as
you
please
go
or
stay
so
may
but
you
don
t
say
whether
you
are
going
of
not
i
shall
stay
at
home
as
there
are
some
matters
for
me
to
attend
to
perhaps
nearly
as
important
as
those
which
will
keep
my
wife
at
home
he
said
in
a
playful
tone
turning
toward
her
again
as
he
spoke
i
am
not
sorry
to
hear
it
my
dear
violet
responded
and
i
don
t
want
to
go
said
grace
i
never
do
like
to
go
to
the
city
without
my
father
to
take
care
of
me
with
an
affectionate
look
up
into
his
face
besides
i
ve
promised
to
help
elsie
arrange
her
and
make
some
new
clothes
for
her
ah
and
of
course
promises
must
be
kept
but
as
you
do
not
want
to
go
without
papa
you
will
not
feel
it
a
hardship
i
hope
to
keep
yours
to
your
little
but
i
wouldn
t
want
gracie
to
stay
at
home
if
she
wanted
to
go
said
little
elsie
no
indeed
i
wouldn
t
no
my
dear
baby
girl
is
not
so
selfish
as
that
i
am
sure
he
returned
with
a
loving
look
into
the
rosy
dimpled
face
but
i
feel
quite
sure
gracie
does
not
want
to
and
somehow
papa
always
knows
what
we
want
elsie
grace
said
with
a
contented
little
laugh
and
as
you
will
have
grandma
elsie
aunt
elsie
rosie
and
evelyn
along
to
help
you
select
your
dresses
and
other
things
you
won
t
miss
me
if
i
stay
at
home
marian
said
lulu
i
want
to
get
out
our
s
and
arrange
our
desks
ready
for
school
for
papa
says
we
are
to
begin
lessons
again
i
shall
miss
you
i
know
marian
answered
with
a
smile
but
of
course
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
that
you
should
go
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
be
a
hindrance
to
half
an
hour
later
the
carriages
from
ion
and
fairview
were
seen
coming
up
the
drive
the
raymonds
and
their
guest
were
all
on
the
veranda
watching
for
them
marian
ready
dressed
for
the
little
jaunt
well
here
we
are
called
out
a
cheery
voice
as
the
foremost
vehicle
drew
up
in
front
of
the
veranda
how
many
of
you
are
going
with
us
only
young
guest
the
captain
replied
handing
marian
in
as
he
spoke
cousin
ronald
grandma
elsie
and
her
daughter
rosie
were
its
occupants
and
each
gave
marian
an
affectionate
morning
greeting
then
violet
stepped
forward
for
a
moment
s
chat
with
her
mother
in
which
rosie
and
the
captain
joined
thus
leaving
marian
and
lilburn
the
opportunity
for
a
bit
of
private
chat
of
their
own
lassie
he
said
with
a
kindly
smile
dinna
forget
that
you
are
a
sort
o
adopted
child
o
my
ain
and
that
i
hae
a
father
s
right
to
at
least
help
provide
you
wi
a
things
needful
slipping
a
roll
of
into
her
hand
oh
she
exclaimed
half
under
her
breath
and
with
starting
tears
how
good
and
generous
you
are
to
me
i
never
had
half
as
much
in
all
my
why
my
bairnie
you
have
na
counted
it
yet
he
exclaimed
with
a
low
gleeful
laugh
no
sir
but
such
a
many
bills
he
laughed
again
it
s
clear
enough
lass
that
you
ve
had
small
acquaintance
wi
one
alone
may
be
worth
a
thousand
o
another
denomination
there
are
twenty
tens
and
ten
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
oh
how
much
i
feel
myself
a
woman
of
wealth
but
what
can
i
ever
do
to
show
my
gratitude
she
said
low
and
tremulously
happy
grateful
tears
shining
in
her
eyes
then
were
exchanged
and
the
carriage
drove
on
toward
evening
marian
returned
with
what
was
to
her
an
astonishing
wealth
of
lovely
apparel
she
had
a
great
dislike
of
mourning
but
had
chosen
quiet
colors
such
as
met
with
grandma
elsie
s
cordial
approval
her
purchases
came
to
woodburn
in
the
carriage
with
her
she
took
great
delight
in
showing
them
to
violet
and
the
little
girls
and
they
scarcely
less
in
looking
at
them
now
said
violet
we
will
get
several
persons
to
work
on
your
dresses
and
have
them
ready
as
soon
as
possible
for
your
wearing
i
am
delighted
with
your
choice
and
feel
sure
everything
you
have
bought
will
prove
very
oh
how
good
you
are
to
me
dear
cousin
vi
exclaimed
marian
with
feeling
but
i
do
think
that
after
so
much
has
been
done
for
me
to
make
up
my
dresses
myself
is
the
least
that
ought
to
be
asked
of
no
no
marian
said
the
captain
that
would
never
do
i
could
not
think
of
allowing
it
because
it
would
keep
you
so
long
out
of
the
ah
my
dear
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
are
in
haste
to
get
her
where
she
will
be
subject
to
your
control
exclaimed
violet
laughingly
ah
lu
don
t
look
so
indignant
that
was
but
a
sorry
one
i
appreciate
the
kindness
of
your
father
s
motives
fully
as
much
i
think
as
any
one
else
ah
i
fear
my
dear
eldest
daughter
is
but
a
silly
little
girl
as
regards
her
father
and
the
respect
paid
him
by
others
remarked
the
captain
laying
a
hand
affectionately
upon
lulu
s
shoulder
as
she
stood
by
his
side
i
m
afraid
i
am
papa
she
returned
coloring
and
smiling
rather
shamefacedly
but
i
just
can
t
bear
to
have
even
mamma
vi
talk
as
if
you
weren
t
quite
at
that
the
captain
laughed
it
would
never
do
coming
from
a
daughter
he
said
but
is
entirely
excusable
in
a
thank
you
sir
laughed
vi
i
quite
appreciate
the
privilege
you
accord
i
m
afraid
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
to
my
room
and
make
myself
neat
for
tea
said
marian
pulling
out
a
pretty
little
watch
at
which
lulu
and
grace
cried
how
lovely
yes
it
is
another
of
cousin
ronald
s
gifts
something
i
had
hardly
ever
dared
to
hope
to
possess
was
it
not
good
and
kind
in
him
to
give
it
to
me
then
she
told
of
the
roll
of
he
had
put
into
her
hand
that
morning
and
that
the
price
of
the
watch
did
not
come
out
of
that
it
was
handed
about
from
one
to
another
admired
by
all
then
returned
to
its
owner
who
immediately
gathered
up
a
number
of
her
packages
and
with
lulu
and
a
servant
carrying
the
rest
hastened
to
her
room
the
two
girls
came
down
again
presently
in
answer
to
the
it
was
the
usual
tempting
meal
to
which
they
sat
down
simple
but
daintily
prepared
daintily
served
and
made
all
the
more
palatable
and
enjoyable
by
cheerful
chat
in
which
even
the
little
ones
were
allowed
a
share
on
leaving
the
table
marian
was
taken
by
lulu
and
grace
to
see
the
oh
what
a
lovely
room
what
beautiful
desks
and
chairs
she
exclaimed
and
with
your
dear
father
for
teacher
it
must
be
only
a
pleasure
a
great
pleasure
to
study
here
so
lu
and
i
think
said
grace
though
i
must
own
that
there
are
times
when
i
m
a
little
i
too
said
lulu
oftener
than
gracie
i
think
but
though
papa
is
always
very
patient
and
kind
he
insists
that
if
we
are
well
the
lessons
must
be
i
am
sure
that
is
kind
said
marian
a
good
education
is
so
so
than
wealth
because
not
so
easily
and
for
other
reasons
quite
as
well
worth
considering
added
a
manly
voice
behind
them
and
turning
in
its
direction
they
found
captain
raymond
standing
near
marian
s
look
was
inquiring
and
he
went
on
knowledge
of
the
right
kind
brings
more
real
pleasure
into
one
s
life
than
can
be
found
in
wealth
fits
one
for
greater
usefulness
and
is
as
you
just
remarked
not
so
easily
very
true
sir
marian
responded
thoughtfully
and
if
you
help
me
to
gain
that
you
will
be
a
benefactor
i
am
disposed
to
do
all
i
can
to
help
you
my
good
girl
he
said
in
a
kindly
tone
and
i
think
your
companionship
with
lulu
in
her
studies
will
so
interest
and
spur
her
on
that
i
shall
feel
more
than
repaid
for
the
slight
addition
to
my
papa
asked
grace
thoughtfully
doesn
t
it
say
somewhere
in
the
bible
that
it
is
better
to
get
wisdom
than
gold
yes
in
proverbs
solomon
exclaims
how
much
better
is
it
to
get
wisdom
than
gold
and
to
get
understanding
rather
to
be
chosen
than
silver
and
knowledge
rather
than
choice
gold
for
wisdom
is
better
than
rubies
and
all
the
things
that
may
be
desired
are
not
to
be
compared
to
but
doubtless
he
there
refers
to
heavenly
saving
faith
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
who
is
the
wisdom
by
which
god
established
the
heavens
and
founded
the
when
am
i
to
begin
school
captain
asked
marian
presently
i
think
i
will
let
you
off
until
next
week
if
you
wish
it
he
replied
in
a
playful
tone
or
as
i
go
to
annapolis
for
a
day
or
two
early
the
week
after
perhaps
you
may
as
well
delay
beginning
your
studies
until
my
o
marian
don
t
do
begin
next
monday
urged
lulu
i
do
so
want
to
have
you
with
us
in
the
and
for
you
to
find
out
what
a
good
and
kind
teacher
papa
his
eldest
daughter
being
the
judge
remarked
the
captain
with
an
amused
look
and
his
second
daughter
being
of
exactly
the
same
opinion
added
grace
slipping
a
hand
into
his
as
she
stood
close
at
his
side
he
pressed
it
affectionately
then
still
holding
it
fast
proposed
that
they
should
return
to
the
veranda
where
they
had
been
sitting
before
the
call
to
the
he
led
the
way
with
grace
the
others
following
and
presently
the
four
were
seated
there
grace
close
to
her
father
on
one
side
lulu
on
the
other
and
marian
near
at
hand
o
marian

say

begin
lessons

urged
lulu
again
i
m
perfectly
sure

dresses

time
and
if
there
is
any
fitting
not
done
it
can
be
attended
to

of

hours
or
papa
will
let
you
go
for
a
little
for
he
s
always
reasonable
and
kind
if
it
is
his
own
little
girl
that
says
so
she
concluded
with
a
roguish
look
up
into
her
father
s
face
ah
marian
if
you
are
wise
you
will
not
put
too
much
faith
in
the
opinion
of
one
who
evidently
looks
at
the
person
under
discussion
through
glasses
remarked
the
captain
in
a
gravely
warning
tone
it
seems
to
be
the
way
with
every
one
who
knows
you
sir
laughed
marian
so
i
will
be
on
my
guard
till
i
have
learned
more
of
you
through
my
own
and
do
you
mean
to
wait
till
you
have
satisfied
yourself
upon
that
point
before
you
venture
to
become
one
of
his
pupils
queried
lulu
it
would
not
be
waiting
very
long
as
i
am
already
satisfied
that
captain
raymond
is
to
be
trusted
for
i
have
had
a
report
of
his
teaching
and
government
from
both
rosie
and
evelyn
a
most
favorable
one
from
each
marian
said
in
reply
and
of
course
they
wouldn
t
be
as
likely
to
prove
partial
judges
as
his
own
daughters
who
love
him
so
dearly
remarked
grace
with
her
arm
about
her
father
s
neck
her
eyes
gazing
fondly
into
his
i
think
i
shall
venture
returned
marian
my
intention
is
to
be
careful
to
keep
rules
and
to
work
very
hard
at
the
lessons
so
doing
i
can
not
think
i
shall
run
much
risk
of
punishment
the
worst
he
could
inflict
expelling
me
would
was
going
to
say
leave
me
where
it
found
me
it
would
be
worse
than
that
disgrace
and
disappointment
but
i
don
t
intend
ever
to
be
so
idle
mischievous
or
rebellious
as
to
bring
it
on
i
have
not
the
slightest
fear
that
you
will
said
the
captain
and
i
think
too
that
i
know
you
pretty
thoroughly
since
the
weeks
spent
in
the
same
house
with
you
in
and
do
you
intend
then
to
begin
on
monday
queried
lulu
with
a
look
of
joyous
expectancy
yes
indeed
if
nothing
happens
to
prevent
i
do
not
want
to
lose
any
time
for
i
wish
to
be
able
to
earn
my
own
living
as
soon
as
why
what
a
very
independent
young
woman
you
seem
to
be
cousin
marian
laughed
a
sweet
girlish
voice
close
at
hand
and
violet
tripped
lightly
from
the
doorway
to
a
chair
which
her
husband
hastily
putting
grace
from
his
knee
drew
forward
for
her
use
thank
you
my
dear
she
said
taking
possession
you
are
intending
to
become
one
of
my
husband
s
pupils
marian
he
has
invited
me
and
i
have
thankfully
accepted
marian
replied
i
think
it
a
most
kind
and
generous
i
entirely
agree
with
you
in
that
opinion
violet
returned
with
a
look
of
ardent
admiring
affection
up
into
her
husband
s
face
but
can
assure
you
that
kindness
and
generosity
are
nothing
new
for
ah
i
knew
that
much
about
him
before
he
left
minersville
returned
marian
many
there
can
testify
to
his
great
kindness
and
just
then
a
carriage
was
seen
coming
up
the
drive
and
the
captain
rose
with
a
sigh
of
relief
to
meet
and
welcome
his
guests
who
proved
to
be
callers
from
one
of
the
neighboring
plantations
the
next
morning
while
the
other
young
folks
resumed
the
duties
of
the
marian
was
with
alma
s
assistance
busied
with
planning
cutting
and
fitting
the
new
dresses
each
had
heard
something
of
the
other
s
story
alma
had
many
questions
to
ask
about
life
among
the
mormons
and
the
more
she
heard
from
marian
in
reply
the
more
did
she
rejoice
in
the
narrow
escape
of
herself
and
sister
from
their
toils
the
moment
they
were
dismissed
from
the
rosie
evelyn
and
lulu
came
in
search
of
marian
rosie
had
some
news
to
tell
mamma
had
a
letter
this
morning
from
my
brothers
harold
and
herbert
begging
and
entreating
her
to
come
to
the
commencement
at
princeton
i
suppose
you
all
know
that
they
are
to
graduate
and
they
think
they
must
have
mamma
there
to
enjoy
their
triumph
i
presume
she
added
laughingly
and
will
she
go
asked
marian
i
think
she
will
replied
rosie
and
that
grandpa
and
grandma
will
go
with
her
they
both
have
relatives
in
and
about
philadelphia
and
will
take
the
opportunity
to
visit
them
on
which
side
is
the
relationship
with
cousin
elsie
asked
marian
with
a
look
of
interest
oh
they
are
none
of
them
her
mother
s
relatives
said
rosie
but
grandpa
s
a
brother
of
grandma
rose
so
she
and
her
children
are
related
to
both
sides
of
our
house
and
grandma
rose
has
other
brothers
and
sisters
in
that
neighborhood
besides
her
old
father
and
mother
so
she
likes
to
visit
there
and
they
of
course
must
always
be
delighted
to
have
her
with
them
such
a
sweet
lovely
lady
as
cousin
elsie
is
but
she
will
go
first
to
max
s
commencement
won
t
she
rosie
i
mean
the
commencement
at
the
naval
academy
at
annapolis
said
lulu
she
says
she
wants
and
intends
to
replied
rosie
that
is
if
she
is
well
enough
and
she
certainly
seems
very
well
indeed
just
i
am
so
glad
of
it
exclaimed
lulu
we
are
all
going
in
the
if
nothing
happens
to
prevent
and
i
hope
all
of
you
girls
will
be
with
us
it
is
so
lovely
there
and
i
think
we
are
likely
to
have
a
delightful
it
will
all
be
new
to
you
marian
observed
rosie
pleasantly
oh
i
do
not
expect
to
make
one
of
the
party
returned
marian
quickly
and
with
a
blush
papa
said
you
were
to
go
if
you
wanted
to
said
lulu
and
i
am
sure
you
would
if
you
could
realize
what
a
delightful
trip
it
will
i
thank
both
you
and
your
father
lulu
very
much
indeed
marian
returned
with
a
blush
and
a
smile
but
i
have
little
or
nothing
fit
to
wear
at
such
a
place
and
in
such
company
and
it
would
be
entirely
impossible
for
me
to
get
ready
in
yes
i
suppose
so
said
lulu
looking
somewhat
disappointed
but
there
will
probably
be
other
times
when
you
can
go
she
added
brightening
up
at
that
moment
grace
looked
in
at
the
door
with
an
announcement
grandma
elsie
grandpa
dinsmore
and
cousin
ronald
are
in
the
veranda
talking
with
papa
and
and
are
we
invited
to
join
the
conference
queried
rosie
in
a
merry
jesting
tone
i
don
t
think
it
s
a
secret
conference
replied
grace
and
i
suppose
we
can
all
join
it
if
we
want
i
should
like
to
do
so
if
i
could
leave
my
work
marian
said
but
i
must
stay
and
attend
to
it
unless
they
say
i
am
wanted
for
some
particular
in
that
case
we
ll
let
you
know
marian
said
lulu
as
she
and
the
others
hastened
from
the
room
together
they
found
the
older
people
arranging
plans
for
attending
the
annapolis
and
princeton
commencements
it
was
already
decided
that
to
the
first
all
would
go
from
woodburn
and
ion
who
cared
to
some
of
them
by
rail
the
others
in
the
then
and
dinsmore
and
grandma
elsie
to
the
other
and
also
before
returning
they
would
spend
some
weeks
in
visiting
friends
and
relatives
in
and
about
philadelphia
the
young
folks
listened
quietly
but
with
intense
interest
now
and
then
exchanging
glances
which
told
plainly
how
delighted
they
were
with
the
prospect
of
having
a
share
in
the
expedition
to
annapolis
even
grace
who
usually
thought
home
the
most
desirable
place
for
her
being
no
exception
she
presently
stole
to
her
father
s
side
slipped
her
hand
into
his
and
looked
up
into
his
face
with
a
bright
glad
smile
i
am
to
go
too
papa
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
meant
only
for
his
ear
unless
you
prefer
to
stay
at
home
daughter
he
said
putting
an
arm
around
her
and
drawing
her
closer
to
him
smoothing
her
hair
with
the
other
hand
and
smiling
fondly
down
into
the
fair
young
face
oh
no
sir
i
want
to
go
specially
as
mamma
vi
and
elsie
and
baby
ned
will
all
go
along
and
we
ll
be
in
the
and
not
in
the
tiresome
yes
i
think
the
is
far
more
comfortable
than
the
cars
and
i
trust
the
little
trip
will
prove
very
enjoyable
to
us
all
he
replied
by
no
means
that
his
little
girl
was
so
happy
in
the
prospect
chapter
time
moved
on
swiftly
enough
to
the
older
people
busily
engaged
in
preparations
for
the
contemplated
trip
to
annapolis
yet
with
rather
laggard
step
to
the
younger
ones
who
were
in
haste
to
experience
its
pleasures
and
excitements
but
in
the
performance
of
school
duties
they
one
and
all
acquitted
themselves
quite
to
the
captain
s
satisfaction
even
excitable
lulu
finding
it
not
nearly
so
difficult
to
concentrate
her
thoughts
upon
the
business
in
hand
as
it
had
been
when
first
her
father
began
to
act
as
tutor
to
his
children
also
marian
s
companionship
in
her
lessons
during
the
second
week
was
an
assistance
to
renewed
and
increased
interest
in
them
but
at
length
the
appointed
day
for
the
sailing
of
the
came
marian
adhered
to
her
decision
to
remain
behind
attending
to
the
preparation
of
her
summer
wardrobe
but
the
others
all
in
good
health
and
spirits
were
ready
and
eager
for
the
trip
the
weather
was
charming
making
their
drive
to
the
city
delightful
the
rest
of
the
short
journey
on
board
the
they
found
awaiting
them
at
the
wharf
and
in
the
most
beautiful
order
everything
about
her
deck
and
above
and
below
looking
spick
and
span
as
though
she
had
but
just
come
from
the
hands
of
her
builders
and
decorators
they
arrived
the
day
before
that
on
which
the
graduating
exercises
were
to
be
held
dropping
anchor
in
the
severn
just
as
the
afternoon
artillery
drill
began
they
witnessed
it
from
the
deck
and
could
see
that
max
was
a
prominent
figure
therein
he
seemed
to
go
into
it
most
enthusiastically
and
they
all
his
father
especially
watched
his
every
movement
with
pride
and
delight
he
had
purposely
left
the
lad
in
ignorance
of
the
exact
time
of
the
expected
arrival
and
max
discovered
the
near
vicinity
of
the
only
when
the
exercises
had
come
to
an
end
at
the
same
instant
a
message
from
the
commandant
reached
him
giving
permission
for
him
to
go
aboard
the
yacht
and
remain
there
until
nine
that
evening
and
the
was
seen
to
leave
her
side
with
the
captain
in
it
in
a
very
few
moments
more
max
was
on
the
deck
of
the
yacht
surrounded
by
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
him
his
father
looking
on
with
beaming
eyes
while
they
crowded
around
the
lad
with
their
joyful
and
affectionate
greetings
now
max
sit
down
here
among
us
and
give
a
full
account
of
yourself
your
doings
and
experiences
since
we
saw
you
last
said
grandma
elsie
with
an
affectionate
smile
into
the
bright
young
face
and
making
room
for
him
by
her
side
as
she
spoke
max
gave
his
father
an
inquiring
look
and
receiving
an
approving
nod
in
reply
took
the
seat
and
did
his
best
to
answer
satisfactorily
the
questions
which
were
showered
upon
him
from
all
sides
queries
as
to
the
progress
he
was
making
in
his
studies
exercise
field
artillery
infantry
tactics
and
in
regard
to
various
other
matters
but
a
joyous
bark
suddenly
interrupted
the
talk
and
max
s
dog
prince
bounded
into
the
midst
of
the
group
raised
himself
upon
his
hind
legs
put
his
on
his
young
master
s
shoulders
his
tail
wagging
fast
with
delight
and
tried
to
lick
max
s
face
why
hello
prince
i
m
glad
to
see
you
old
fellow
cried
the
lad
patting
and
stroking
him
but
avoiding
the
caress
there
that
will
do
you
try
to
kiss
harder
and
longer
than
any
other
of
my
p
raps
that
s
because
i
love
you
harder
prince
seemed
to
say
and
it
s
longer
since
i
saw
you
last
the
captain
never
invited
me
to
come
along
he
didn
t
laughed
max
well
i
don
t
believe
you
asked
him
but
i
m
right
glad
to
see
you
here
at
last
also
to
find
you
haven
t
forgotten
how
to
no
my
young
master
but
it
s
the
first
time
i
ve
done
anything
in
that
line
since
you
left
me
at
by
this
time
everybody
was
laughing
oh
max
who
is
making
prince
or
cousin
ronald
asked
lulu
see
if
you
can
t
find
out
for
yourself
lu
laughed
max
suppose
you
ask
prince
surely
he
should
well
i
ll
try
it
she
returned
merrily
prince
who
helped
you
to
do
that
talking
just
now
why
who
helps
you
to
talk
miss
lu
came
promptly
in
return
apparently
from
the
dog
s
lips
oh
i
don
t
need
any
help
in
that
line
she
returned
laughingly
and
never
have
since
i
first
learned
how
in
my
do
you
never
tire
of
talking
miss
lu
the
query
seemed
to
come
from
prince
s
lips
as
he
looked
up
gravely
into
her
face
no
i
can
t
say
that
i
do
she
laughed
do
you
i
am
oftener
tired
of
not
being
able
to
express
my
thoughts
and
feelings
was
the
reply
then
the
call
to
tea
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
for
the
time
prince
followed
the
others
to
the
table
and
when
all
were
seated
laid
himself
down
at
max
s
feet
there
he
lay
looking
up
into
the
lad
s
face
and
when
the
plates
had
been
filled
a
low
whine
seemed
to
say
he
too
would
be
glad
to
have
a
share
of
the
savory
viands
just
wait
a
bit
old
fellow
and
your
turn
will
come
said
max
you
never
starve
where
my
father
is
master
i
m
no
that
s
true
enough
but
it
is
not
always
so
easy
to
wait
when
one
s
hungry
and
sees
other
folks
with
plates
heaped
with
savory
victuals
right
before
them
why
shouldn
t
dogs
be
helped
at
once
as
well
as
men
women
and
children
prince
s
tail
swept
the
floor
and
his
hungry
eyes
looked
up
wistfully
into
those
of
his
young
master
as
the
words
seemed
to
come
from
his
lips
well
done
prince
such
efforts
at
speech
ought
to
be
duly
rewarded
remarked
the
captain
gravely
then
he
directed
a
servant
to
take
the
dog
out
and
feed
him
well
what
is
the
programme
for
this
evening
asked
violet
a
trip
up
the
river
again
if
you
and
the
others
wish
it
my
dear
replied
her
husband
to
whom
her
query
seemed
to
be
addressed
i
had
thought
however
of
going
down
the
river
and
bay
as
we
went
up
on
our
last
visit
here
we
will
put
it
to
the
vote
of
those
present
i
am
quite
indifferent
personally
as
to
which
course
we
it
soon
appeared
that
the
majority
were
in
favor
of
moving
toward
the
bay
and
on
leaving
the
table
the
captain
issued
his
orders
the
weighed
anchor
and
the
wind
being
favorable
they
sailed
down
the
river
and
out
into
the
bay
annapolis
is
a
very
old
town
is
it
not
brother
levis
asked
walter
yes
was
the
reply
it
was
founded
by
the
puritans
under
captain
william
clayborne
he
first
settled
over
yonder
on
kent
island
in
but
was
expelled
from
and
his
for
refusing
to
acknowledge
allegiance
to
the
newly
established
government
of
lord
baltimore
in
some
puritans
expelled
from
virginia
for
settled
where
now
stands
annapolis
founded
a
town
there
and
called
it
providence
in
it
became
the
capital
of
the
state
and
the
name
was
changed
to
you
have
gone
farther
back
in
its
history
than
you
ever
did
in
telling
us
about
it
before
papa
remarked
lulu
ah
how
far
back
did
i
go
before
he
asked
pleasantly
to
the
time
when
they
heard
of
the
resistance
to
the
passing
of
the
stamp
act
by
the
people
of
massachusetts
sir
she
replied
don
t
you
remember
that
when
we
were
sailing
from
newport
to
annapolis
to
bring
max
here
to
enter
the
academy
we
young
folks
all
gathered
round
you
just
as
we
have
and
asked
for
revolutionary
happenings
in
maryland
ah
yes
i
do
remember
it
now
though
it
was
nearly
a
year
ago
he
returned
looking
with
a
humorous
smile
down
into
her
eyes
why
just
think
exclaimed
max
the
town
was
then
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
what
a
venerable
old
place
it
is
now
ah
no
wonder
you
grow
manly
so
fast
young
sir
living
in
such
a
grand
old
place
remarked
a
strange
voice
apparently
coming
from
the
rear
of
the
little
party
seated
pretty
close
together
on
the
deck
naturally
every
head
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
but
the
speaker
was
not
to
be
seen
who
and
where
are
you
sir
queried
the
captain
step
forward
and
take
a
seat
with
the
rest
of
thank
you
sir
but
i
do
not
want
to
intrude
you
must
excuse
me
for
coming
aboard
but
i
wanted
a
sail
and
thought
my
weight
wouldn
t
retard
the
boat
i
ll
pay
for
my
passage
if
you
say
the
speaker
continued
invisible
though
every
word
was
distinctly
heard
then
do
so
by
giving
us
a
sight
of
your
face
returned
captain
raymond
it
is
not
covered
sir
and
you
are
all
welcome
to
look
your
fill
was
the
reply
where
is
de
mans
papa
asked
little
ned
gazing
wonderingly
about
sitting
in
cousin
ronald
s
chair
i
think
replied
his
father
smoothing
the
curls
of
the
little
prattler
who
was
seated
upon
his
knee
no
papa
dat
tousin
well
then
perhaps
it
was
brother
no
papa
bruver
maxie
not
talk
dat
way
does
oo
maxie
i
think
not
neddie
boy
returned
max
smiling
on
the
baby
boy
and
giving
his
round
rosy
cheek
an
affectionate
pat
no
no
little
chap
i
m
not
brother
max
said
the
voice
sounding
somewhat
farther
away
than
before
or
any
such
callow
chicken
but
a
ah
ha
i
know
now
that
it
is
cousin
ronald
laughed
lulu
for
max
would
never
call
himself
a
callow
i
shouldn
t
think
cousin
ronald
would
call
him
so
either
said
grace
in
a
hurt
tone
chickens
are
cowardly
and
i
m
sure
max
is
better
not
be
too
sure
but
wait
till
you
see
him
tried
miss
said
a
squeaky
little
voice
coming
seemingly
from
another
part
of
the
vessel
now
that
s
you
max
i
know
because
it
is
the
very
same
voice
we
heard
at
minersville
on
the
evening
of
the
glorious
fourth
remarked
lulu
with
a
merry
laugh
max
neither
acknowledged
nor
denied
that
she
was
right
looking
up
and
catching
sight
of
the
stars
and
stripes
floating
from
the
masthead
o
lu
he
asked
do
you
know
who
invented
our
old
glory
as
we
love
to
call
her
why
no
who
did
a
little
woman
named
betty
ross
a
philadelphia
quakeress
she
had
a
great
deal
of
taste
was
particularly
fond
of
red
white
and
blue
and
adorned
many
of
the
apartments
we
read
of
in
colonial
history
the
halls
of
congress
the
governor
s
in
philadelphia
among
others
she
was
acquainted
with
a
number
of
the
great
men
of
the
franklin
rittenhouse
adams
and
best
and
greatest
of
washington
and
she
had
a
colonel
ross
who
was
a
gallant
american
officer
in
the
revolutionary
war
on
the
of
june
congress
was
considering
about
a
design
for
a
national
flag
and
it
was
at
once
proposed
that
betsy
ross
should
be
requested
to
design
one
the
committee
asked
colonel
ross
franklin
and
robert
morris
to
call
upon
her
they
went
and
general
washington
with
them
ross
consented
drew
the
design
and
made
the
first
american
flag
with
her
own
hands
general
washington
had
showed
her
a
rough
design
which
she
said
was
stars
having
six
corners
when
the
right
number
was
but
five
she
said
she
didn
t
know
whether
she
could
make
the
flag
but
would
try
which
as
i
have
just
said
she
did
and
succeeded
so
well
that
congress
was
satisfied
with
it
and
it
was
the
first
banner
that
ever
floated
on
the
there
was
an
eagle
on
that
flag
max
was
there
not
asked
the
captain
as
the
lad
paused
in
his
story
yes
sir
a
spread
eagle
with
the
thirteen
stars
in
a
circle
of
rays
of
glory
it
is
said
that
many
eminent
men
visited
ross
shop
while
she
was
at
work
on
the
flag
and
were
deeply
interested
in
well
remarked
lulu
thoughtfully
if
that
flag
was
flung
to
the
breeze
in
june
of
it
is
a
mistake
for
people
to
say
that
the
rough
flag
made
and
floated
at
fort
schuyler
the
next
fall
was
the
quite
true
said
her
father
though
probably
makers
of
the
fort
schuyler
not
heard
of
the
other
and
believed
theirs
to
be
the
first
it
is
stated
that
washington
had
displayed
at
cambridge
massachusetts
on
january
what
might
be
called
the
original
of
our
present
banner
it
had
thirteen
stripes
of
red
and
white
with
a
andrew
cross
instead
of
the
was
there
not
another
called
the
rattlesnake
flag
asked
rosie
yes
in
two
forms
in
one
the
figure
was
left
complete
and
under
it
were
the
words
don
t
tread
on
in
the
other
the
snake
was
in
thirteen
some
cases
with
thirteen
the
legend
was
join
or
the
captain
paused
a
moment
then
went
on
i
was
reading
lately
an
account
taken
from
an
english
paper
of
what
was
probably
the
first
floating
of
the
american
flag
in
british
waters
it
was
on
february
that
the
ship
a
massachusetts
vessel
commanded
by
captain
moore
passed
gravesend
and
on
the
she
was
reported
at
the
the
lords
of
council
and
the
commissioners
of
the
customs
held
a
consultation
because
of
the
many
acts
of
parliament
still
in
force
against
the
rebels
of
our
british
cousins
were
wont
to
style
allowing
her
regular
entry
she
was
american
built
manned
wholly
by
american
seamen
and
belonged
to
nantucket
massachusetts
the
article
goes
on
to
say
she
carried
the
rebel
colors
and
was
the
first
to
display
the
rebellious
stripes
of
america
in
any
british
but
before
that
the
stars
and
stripes
had
appeared
on
british
soil
a
noted
philanthropist
and
sturdy
patriot
of
philadelphia
named
elkannah
watson
had
at
the
close
of
the
revolutionary
war
received
four
hundred
guineas
as
a
wager
and
on
the
same
day
was
dining
with
the
painter
copley
whom
he
engaged
to
paint
his
portrait
for
the
sum
of
money
just
obtained
from
the
wager
the
portrait
was
all
finished
but
the
background
which
they
had
agreed
should
represent
a
ship
bearing
to
america
the
news
of
the
acknowledgment
by
the
british
government
of
our
stars
and
stripes
floating
from
her
gaff
and
gilded
by
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
was
still
wanting
the
painter
considering
it
imprudent
to
put
it
there
at
that
time
as
his
gallery
was
the
resort
of
royalty
and
the
nobility
watson
speaks
of
the
glorious
of
december
on
which
he
and
copley
listened
to
the
speech
of
the
king
in
which
he
formally
received
and
recognized
the
united
states
of
america
as
one
of
the
nations
of
the
earth
after
that
watson
went
home
with
the
artist
to
dinner
but
before
sitting
down
to
the
table
copley
finished
his
picture
inviting
his
company
to
be
present
in
his
studio
while
with
a
bold
hand
master
touch
and
american
heart
he
attached
to
the
ship
the
stars
and
that
was
displaying
what
the
british
had
called
the
rebel
colors
very
promptly
upon
the
king
s
acknowledgment
and
very
near
his
palace
remarked
dinsmore
with
a
smile
of
grim
satisfaction
yes
doubtless
a
bitter
pill
for
his
majesty
to
swallow
laughed
rosie
well
he
needn
t
have
had
it
to
swallow
if
he
hadn
t
been
so
tyrannical
and
obstinate
remarked
walter
i
remember
that
bancroft
says
the
american
struggle
was
avowedly
a
war
in
defence
of
the
common
rights
of
that
is
very
true
walter
returned
his
grandfather
leading
men
of
the
a
noble
band
of
patriots
and
lovers
of
their
kind
we
have
a
right
to
be
proud
of
and
i
am
proud
of
them
sir
returned
the
lad
his
cheeks
glowing
and
his
eyes
sparkling
that
s
right
my
little
man
everybody
should
love
his
country
and
feel
proud
of
all
its
people
who
resist
tyranny
and
stand
up
boldly
for
the
principle
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
said
a
strange
voice
which
seemed
to
come
from
their
rear
every
one
turned
to
see
the
speaker
then
finding
he
was
not
visible
laughed
pleasantly
i
am
glad
to
learn
that
you
are
so
well
acquainted
with
our
glorious
declaration
of
independence
cousin
ronald
and
seem
to
appreciate
it
so
highly
remarked
grandma
elsie
with
a
smiling
look
into
the
pleasant
face
of
her
kinsman
ah
indeed
cousin
are
you
entirely
sure
that
i
am
deserving
of
that
compliment
queried
lilburn
gravely
quite
sure
she
returned
i
could
hardly
have
quoted
it
so
correctly
but
was
that
my
voice
cousin
he
asked
one
of
your
voices
i
have
no
doubt
she
replied
laughingly
mr
lilburn
said
max
i
have
been
telling
some
of
my
comrades
of
your
ventriloquial
powers
and
they
are
extremely
desirous
to
witness
their
exercise
will
you
not
kindly
gratify
them
while
here
why
laddie
i
am
hardly
more
capable
in
that
line
than
yourself
laughed
the
old
gentleman
but
you
sir
are
not
under
authority
as
i
am
and
so
liable
to
be
called
to
account
for
your
eh
perhaps
not
well
well
we
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
opportunities
you
and
i
own
i
am
not
averse
to
gratifying
the
young
folks
when
i
can
do
so
without
displeasing
their
chapter
vi
a
momentary
silence
following
upon
lilburn
s
remark
was
broken
by
a
question
from
grace
we
are
away
out
in
the
bay
now
aren
t
we
papa
she
asked
yes
daughter
and
must
turn
presently
for
max
s
leave
of
absence
will
be
over
by
the
time
i
can
take
him
back
to
the
but
i
may
hope
to
be
with
you
all
again
and
the
next
day
when
the
graduating
exercises
are
over
may
i
not
papa
asked
max
i
think
so
provided
you
keep
out
of
scrapes
his
father
replied
laying
a
hand
affectionately
on
the
lad
s
shoulder
as
he
spoke
for
max
was
now
close
to
his
side
and
one
evening
or
the
if
you
may
bring
some
of
your
mates
with
you
and
perhaps
cousin
ronald
and
you
yourself
may
be
able
to
entertain
them
with
some
exertion
of
your
ventriloquial
oh
thank
you
papa
said
max
delightedly
nothing
could
be
better
cousin
ronald
will
i
dare
say
make
great
sport
for
them
and
perhaps
i
could
do
a
little
myself
but
whom
shall
i
invite
i
am
very
sure
any
of
them
would
be
delighted
to
i
leave
the
selection
to
you
my
son
replied
the
captain
choose
any
whom
you
think
the
right
sort
of
company
for
yourself
and
us
and
likely
to
enjoy
being
thank
you
sir
how
many
shall
i
ask
well
my
boy
as
we
are
not
expecting
to
keep
them
over
night
six
or
eight
would
not
i
think
be
more
than
we
can
accommodate
and
that
will
be
as
many
as
i
care
to
ask
at
one
time
max
said
with
satisfaction
hunt
will
be
glad
to
come
i
know
and
he
s
a
nice
you
ll
want
to
ask
those
who
are
anxious
to
make
cousin
ronald
s
acquaintance
i
presume
said
his
father
yes
sir
some
of
them
if
i
asked
all
it
would
include
my
whole
class
besides
a
good
many
belonging
to
the
others
laughed
max
very
well
said
his
father
you
know
about
how
many
we
can
accommodate
and
i
leave
the
selection
to
you
feeling
quite
sure
that
my
boy
will
prefer
those
of
good
character
for
his
intimate
yes
indeed
papa
and
i
thank
you
very
much
for
trusting
the
was
presently
at
her
wharf
again
and
the
had
to
be
said
but
expecting
to
have
max
with
them
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
even
his
sisters
were
not
sad
over
the
parting
while
the
lad
himself
was
jubilant
in
the
pleasant
prospect
of
entertaining
his
boy
friends
and
comrades
on
board
the
yacht
he
hurried
to
his
room
and
filled
up
the
few
remaining
minutes
of
the
allowed
for
recreation
before
retiring
for
the
night
with
giving
hunt
his
a
glowing
account
of
his
visit
to
his
father
s
vessel
and
extending
the
invitation
for
the
next
afternoon
and
evening
which
hunt
accepted
promptly
and
with
evident
delight
the
next
day
was
spent
by
most
of
the
party
from
woodburn
and
ion
in
walks
and
drives
about
the
city
and
its
vicinity
varied
by
some
attendance
upon
the
exercises
at
the
naval
academy
but
before
all
were
on
board
the
yacht
again
where
they
were
presently
joined
by
max
and
his
party
the
lads
were
all
evidently
in
high
good
humor
and
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
knowing
that
they
were
about
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
ventriloquist
of
whose
tricks
max
had
told
them
many
an
exciting
tale
the
introductions
were
over
all
had
been
comfortably
seated
and
some
few
minutes
spent
in
desultory
chat
when
hunt
addressing
max
who
happened
to
be
his
nearest
neighbor
asked
in
a
low
tone
when
the
show
was
to
begin
max
smiled
and
there
was
a
roguish
twinkle
in
his
eyes
while
at
the
same
instant
a
voice
spoke
from
behind
hunt
i
say
young
fellers
in
blue
what
s
brung
so
many
o
ye
aboard
here
to
oncet
there
was
a
simultaneous
sudden
start
and
turning
of
faces
and
eyes
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sounds
had
come
but
the
speaker
seemed
to
have
instantly
disappeared
and
the
momentary
start
was
followed
by
a
general
hearty
laugh
the
captain
s
invitation
replied
hunt
while
his
eyes
and
those
of
the
other
lads
turned
upon
lilburn
all
right
then
responded
the
same
voice
seeming
now
to
come
from
a
more
distant
part
of
the
deck
he
owns
the
yacht
and
kin
ask
anybody
he
s
mind
of
course
said
hunt
and
it
was
very
kind
in
him
to
ask
us
did
he
invite
you
also
sir
none
o
your
business
came
in
reply
in
a
surly
tone
truly
a
gentlemanly
reply
laughed
hunt
one
might
readily
infer
from
it
that
you
were
not
here
by
what
do
you
mean
by
that
sir
demanded
the
invisible
speaker
in
loud
angry
tones
that
your
conduct
and
speech
proclaim
you
no
gentleman
while
captain
raymond
is
decidedly
come
come
friends
don
t
let
us
have
any
quarrelling
here
came
in
pleasant
tones
from
the
other
side
of
the
vessel
now
who
are
you
sir
this
isn
t
your
fight
and
you
d
better
keep
out
of
it
returned
the
first
voice
your
interference
will
be
asked
for
when
it
s
the
lads
exchanged
looks
of
surprise
and
one
of
them
asked
are
you
doing
it
all
lilburn
sir
ah
ha
ah
ha
um
h
m
ah
ha
so
you
think
twas
i
young
sirs
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
in
pretended
astonishment
and
why
so
did
the
voices
issue
from
my
lips
i
can
not
assert
positively
that
they
did
sir
returned
hunt
but
they
seemed
to
come
from
an
invisible
speaker
and
knowing
you
to
be
a
ventriloquist
we
think
it
can
all
be
accounted
for
in
that
knowing
me
to
be
a
ventriloquist
eh
laddie
and
may
i
ask
how
you
came
by
that
same
knowledge
through
our
friend
a
naval
cadet
like
ourselves
max
raymond
sir
do
not
be
vexed
with
him
for
telling
us
it
has
excited
our
admiration
and
desire
to
make
your
ah
master
max
so
you
have
been
letting
these
young
gentlemen
into
my
secrets
lilburn
said
turning
toward
max
in
pretended
wrath
yes
sir
replied
max
in
cheerful
tones
and
the
more
you
show
them
of
your
skill
in
that
line
the
better
they
will
be
just
then
max
s
dog
prince
joined
the
group
wagging
his
tail
and
lifting
joyful
eyes
to
his
young
master
s
face
ah
how
d
ye
do
prince
said
max
stroking
and
patting
him
are
you
glad
to
see
me
here
again
yes
sir
indeed
i
am
were
the
words
that
seemed
to
come
in
reply
from
the
dog
s
lips
and
i
wish
you
d
go
back
with
us
when
we
steam
away
in
this
vessel
for
why
prince
you
talk
well
indeed
for
a
dog
laughed
hunt
stroking
and
patting
prince
s
head
at
that
instant
there
was
a
frightened
cry
oh
sic
a
fall
as
i
shall
hae
followed
instantly
by
a
sound
as
of
the
plunge
of
a
heavy
body
from
the
side
of
the
vessel
into
the
water
all
started
to
their
feet
several
of
the
men
and
boys
shouting
in
tones
of
alarm
a
man
overboard
and
captain
raymond
was
about
to
issue
an
order
for
the
launching
of
a
boat
when
a
glance
at
lilburn
deterred
him
no
occasion
captain
laughed
the
old
gentleman
you
could
never
find
that
poor
unfortunate
no
i
presume
not
returned
the
captain
echoing
the
laugh
as
he
and
the
others
reseated
themselves
huh
that
s
an
old
trick
o
yours
old
feller
cried
the
very
same
voice
that
had
been
heard
behind
hunt
s
chair
if
i
couldn
t
invent
suthin
new
i
d
give
up
the
so
i
think
i
at
least
returned
cousin
ronald
but
in
a
disguised
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
a
distance
then
walter
went
to
his
side
and
whispered
in
his
ear
lilburn
smiled
and
seemed
to
assent
but
at
that
instant
the
call
to
the
put
an
end
to
the
sport
for
the
time
there
was
some
of
the
same
sort
of
diversion
at
the
table
however
a
roast
fowl
resenting
with
a
loud
squawk
the
captain
s
attempt
to
carve
it
prince
asking
audibly
for
a
share
when
the
plates
were
filled
and
the
voice
that
had
been
heard
talking
on
deck
to
the
young
fellers
in
blue
preferring
the
same
request
these
tricks
though
old
to
the
others
were
new
to
the
cadets
and
caused
a
good
deal
of
merriment
as
did
the
buzzing
bees
peeping
chick
barking
pups
and
squealing
pigs
that
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
the
deck
on
their
return
thither
at
length
these
sounds
were
replied
to
by
a
loud
and
furious
barking
coming
apparently
from
some
remote
part
of
the
deck
and
to
which
prince
immediately
made
response
in
kind
at
the
same
time
rushing
away
in
search
of
the
intruder
a
pretty
time
you
ll
have
finding
that
newcomer
prince
walter
called
after
him
but
the
words
were
hardly
spoken
when
a
third
loud
bark
was
heard
coming
apparently
from
yet
another
quarter
and
prince
repeating
his
rushed
in
that
direction
then
three
or
four
dogs
seemed
from
the
sounds
to
be
barking
snarling
yelping
as
though
a
furious
canine
fight
was
in
progress
though
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
combatants
except
the
huge
form
of
prince
as
he
searched
in
vain
for
the
intruders
of
his
race
but
the
noise
woke
the
little
ones
who
had
been
put
to
bed
in
the
cabin
below
and
a
frightened
wail
from
them
brought
a
sudden
hush
while
violet
rose
hastily
and
hurried
down
the
companionway
to
sooth
and
reassure
her
darlings
that
put
an
end
to
the
ventriloquial
sport
and
the
remainder
of
the
short
time
allowed
for
the
visit
of
the
cadets
was
spent
in
more
quiet
fashion
desultory
talk
and
the
singing
of
songs
they
had
been
steaming
down
the
river
and
bay
and
back
again
while
they
talked
and
sang
the
wharf
was
reached
shortly
after
nine
o
clock
and
the
lads
returned
safely
and
in
good
season
to
the
academy
they
one
and
all
expressed
themselves
as
highly
delighted
with
their
visit
to
the
yacht
and
were
very
enthusiastic
in
their
praises
of
the
ladies
particularly
grandma
elsie
and
violet
whom
they
pronounced
the
sweetest
most
beautiful
and
charming
women
of
their
acquaintance
they
felt
acquainted
with
them
now
they
said
for
after
cousin
ronald
and
max
had
ceased
their
ventriloquial
performances
they
had
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
the
ladies
as
well
as
to
listen
to
the
music
with
which
they
kindly
entertained
them
i
have
always
thought
you
a
fortunate
fellow
max
remarked
hunt
as
they
were
preparing
for
bed
and
since
seeing
the
yacht
and
that
young
grandmother
and
stepmother
of
yours
i
am
more
fully
convinced
of
it
than
ever
i
was
just
going
to
say
i
wondered
at
so
young
and
lovely
a
creature
as
raymond
marrying
a
man
with
a
son
of
your
age
and
two
other
children
not
young
enough
to
be
her
own
but
remembering
what
your
father
handsome
so
entirely
everything
any
one
could
ask
or
do
not
wonder
at
all
at
her
choice
in
fact
she
may
consider
herself
quite
as
fortunate
as
he
in
the
selection
of
a
partner
for
so
i
think
responded
max
heartily
for
to
me
it
seems
that
my
father
s
i
might
say
his
not
to
be
found
anywhere
and
i
know
mamma
vi
would
agree
with
me
i
have
never
known
him
speak
a
hasty
sharp
or
unkind
word
to
her
and
he
waits
upon
her
as
gallantly
as
he
could
possibly
have
done
in
the
days
of
their
courtship
as
to
the
children
left
him
by
my
own
father
promised
before
marrying
mamma
vi
that
she
should
have
no
care
or
trouble
in
regard
to
them
that
he
would
take
all
that
upon
himself
and
so
he
has
and
does
when
he
has
been
at
home
with
us
we
have
always
felt
that
he
did
so
it
is
no
wonder
if
we
esteem
him
the
dearest
and
best
of
fathers
while
mamma
vi
is
hardly
a
mother
but
more
like
an
older
sister
to
it
may
be
to
grace
the
youngest
of
our
here
the
signal
for
the
extinguishing
of
lights
and
retiring
to
rest
put
a
stop
to
the
conversation
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
lads
were
soundly
sleeping
one
more
day
was
spent
at
annapolis
by
the
woodburn
and
ion
people
then
an
early
evening
train
carried
the
latter
party
northward
and
an
hour
later
the
steamed
away
with
the
others
walter
and
rosie
would
have
been
glad
to
go
with
their
mother
but
she
and
their
grandfather
had
decided
that
it
would
be
better
for
them
to
continue
their
studies
for
the
present
as
the
time
for
the
summer
holidays
was
not
distant
and
like
the
affectionate
children
they
were
they
submitted
cheerfully
to
her
decision
determining
to
make
the
best
possible
use
of
their
opportunity
for
education
their
mother
expected
to
be
at
home
again
in
a
fortnight
or
sooner
but
they
had
rarely
been
separated
from
her
for
even
a
day
and
the
parting
was
a
trial
to
both
they
bore
it
bravely
however
slept
well
that
night
on
board
the
yacht
and
rose
the
next
morning
apparently
as
gay
and
as
their
wont
they
were
both
early
on
deck
where
they
found
the
captain
and
lulu
together
watching
the
sun
just
peeping
above
the
waver
far
away
to
the
east
brother
levis
and
lu
called
rosie
tripping
across
the
deck
in
their
direction
i
thought
walter
and
i
were
extremely
early
but
there
is
no
use
in
anybody
trying
to
get
ahead
of
you
two
in
early
little
sister
responded
the
captain
turning
toward
her
with
his
pleasant
smile
there
was
no
occasion
for
you
and
walter
to
leave
your
couches
quite
so
early
this
morning
or
for
either
of
you
to
do
so
i
believe
lulu
and
i
happen
to
be
of
the
kind
who
need
a
little
less
sleep
than
do
many
yes
said
lulu
with
a
loving
look
up
into
her
father
s
face
papa
would
let
me
sleep
another
hour
if
i
wanted
to
but
i
almost
always
wake
early
and
do
so
enjoy
the
little
time
that
it
gives
me
with
him
before
the
others
are
up
and
wanting
some
of
his
attention
for
i
don
t
wonder
said
walter
for
i
like
to
be
with
mamma
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
dearly
the
boy
s
voice
sounded
a
little
choked
at
the
last
and
he
dropped
his
eyes
lest
the
others
should
see
the
sudden
tears
welling
up
in
them
the
captain
laid
a
kind
hand
on
the
lad
s
shoulder
if
our
dear
mother
is
awake
now
she
is
doubtless
thinking
lovingly
of
her
youngest
son
and
asking
god
to
bless
and
keep
him
from
all
evil
you
may
hope
to
see
her
again
in
about
two
weeks
which
will
pass
very
quickly
and
in
the
mean
time
let
us
think
of
all
we
can
accomplish
to
give
her
pleasure
on
her
return
he
said
shall
we
not
little
brother
yes
oh
yes
sir
replied
walter
looking
up
brightly
into
the
pleasant
face
above
him
i
mean
to
study
hard
and
keep
all
your
rules
carefully
so
that
you
can
give
her
a
good
account
of
my
conduct
and
recitations
oh
there
s
the
sun
just
entirely
up
out
of
the
water
what
a
grand
sight
it
is
one
that
i
never
weary
of
said
captain
raymond
in
a
meditative
tone
and
gazing
eastward
upon
the
newly
risen
luminary
as
he
spoke
it
reminds
me
of
him
who
is
called
the
sun
of
righteousness
because
he
is
the
quickener
comforter
and
illuminator
of
his
papa
didn
t
people
in
the
old
testament
times
worship
the
sun
asked
lulu
yes
replied
her
father
it
is
thought
that
the
moloch
of
the
ammonites
the
chemosh
of
the
moabites
and
the
baal
of
the
phœnicians
was
the
i
remember
that
the
israelites
also
sometimes
wandered
away
from
the
true
god
and
worshipped
baal
remarked
walter
that
elijah
the
prophet
slew
of
baal
s
prophets
four
hundred
and
fifty
men
and
that
afterward
jehu
filled
a
house
with
baal
s
prophets
priests
and
worshippers
and
had
them
all
put
to
yes
the
captain
said
that
was
in
accordance
with
the
command
of
god
given
in
deuteronomy
seventeenth
chapter
i
will
read
it
to
you
he
added
taking
a
small
bible
from
his
pocket
turning
to
the
passage
he
read
if
there
be
found
among
you
within
any
of
thy
gates
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
man
or
woman
that
hath
wrought
wickedness
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
transgressing
his
covenant
and
hath
gone
and
served
other
gods
and
worshipped
them
either
the
sun
or
moon
or
any
of
the
host
of
heaven
which
i
have
not
commanded
and
it
be
told
thee
and
thou
hast
heard
of
it
and
inquired
diligently
and
behold
it
be
true
and
the
thing
certain
that
such
abomination
is
wrought
in
israel
then
shalt
thou
bring
forth
that
man
or
that
woman
which
have
committed
that
wicked
thing
unto
thy
gates
even
that
man
or
that
woman
and
shalt
stone
them
with
stones
till
they
that
gives
us
some
insight
into
god
s
hatred
of
idolatry
remarked
the
captain
closing
the
book
yes
sir
said
rosie
i
am
reading
deuteronomy
just
now
in
my
regular
course
i
was
at
the
fourth
chapter
yesterday
and
was
struck
with
what
is
said
there
about
the
worship
of
images
won
t
you
turn
to
the
chapter
and
read
it
aloud
to
us
brother
levis
certainly
he
replied
opening
the
book
again
and
turning
to
the
passage
to
which
she
had
referred
beginning
at
the
fifteenth
verse
he
read
take
ye
therefore
good
heed
unto
yourselves
for
ye
saw
no
similitude
on
the
day
that
the
lord
spake
unto
you
in
horeb
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
lest
ye
corrupt
yourselves
and
make
you
a
graven
image
the
similitude
of
any
figure
the
likeness
of
male
or
female
the
likeness
of
any
beast
that
is
on
the
earth
the
likeness
of
any
winged
fowl
that
flieth
in
the
air
the
likeness
of
anything
that
creepeth
on
the
ground
the
likeness
of
any
fish
that
is
in
the
waters
beneath
the
earth
and
lest
thou
lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
heaven
and
when
thou
seest
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
even
all
the
host
of
heaven
shouldest
be
driven
to
worship
them
and
serve
them
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
divided
unto
all
nations
under
the
whole
heaven
take
heed
unto
yourselves
lest
ye
forget
the
covenant
of
the
lord
your
god
which
he
made
with
you
and
make
you
a
graven
image
or
the
likeness
of
anything
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
forbidden
thee
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
a
consuming
fire
even
a
jealous
god
when
thou
shalt
beget
children
and
children
s
children
and
ye
shall
have
remained
long
in
the
land
and
shall
corrupt
yourselves
and
make
a
graven
image
or
the
likeness
of
anything
and
shall
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
provoke
him
to
anger
i
call
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
against
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
soon
utterly
perish
from
off
the
land
whereunto
ye
go
over
jordan
to
possess
it
ye
shall
not
prolong
your
days
upon
it
but
shall
utterly
be
i
would
have
you
all
notice
the
captain
said
again
closing
the
book
and
speaking
with
earnestness
how
plainly
and
repeatedly
god
forbids
the
worship
of
images
likenesses
or
of
any
of
the
creatures
or
things
he
hath
made
how
repeatedly
and
expressly
he
commands
us
to
worship
him
and
him
ah
no
wonder
that
the
popish
priests
forbid
their
people
to
read
the
bible
for
themselves
said
rosie
for
from
it
they
would
soon
learn
the
wickedness
of
bowing
down
to
and
worshipping
images
crucifixes
and
yes
replied
captain
raymond
and
i
would
far
sooner
lay
my
children
in
the
grave
dearly
dearly
as
i
love
them
than
to
see
them
bowing
down
to
images
and
pictures
serving
gods
the
work
of
men
s
hands
wood
and
stone
which
neither
see
nor
hear
nor
eat
nor
how
precious
is
the
promise
that
follows
in
that
same
chapter
but
if
from
thence
thou
shalt
seek
the
lord
thy
god
thou
shalt
find
him
if
thou
seek
him
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
when
thou
art
in
tribulation
and
all
these
things
are
come
upon
thee
even
in
the
latter
days
if
thou
turn
to
the
lord
thy
god
and
shalt
be
obedient
unto
his
voice
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
a
merciful
god
he
will
not
forsake
thee
neither
destroy
thee
nor
forget
the
covenant
of
thy
fathers
which
he
sware
unto
verily
i
believe
that
we
of
the
nations
are
the
literal
descendants
of
abraham
isaac
and
s
own
chosen
that
we
have
the
strongest
claim
to
these
precious
promises
but
let
us
never
forget
that
they
are
ours
only
as
we
fulfil
the
prescribed
conditions
without
true
repentance
and
true
faith
we
shall
no
more
be
saved
than
those
of
other
nations
who
do
not
seek
the
lord
while
he
may
be
found
and
call
upon
him
while
he
is
just
then
little
feet
came
across
the
deck
a
sweet
child
voice
calling
out
papa
dear
papa
i
s
an
early
bird
too
isn
t
i
quite
an
early
bird
for
such
a
wee
one
the
captain
answered
holding
out
his
arms
then
as
she
sprang
into
them
clasping
her
close
and
kissing
her
fondly
again
and
again
the
next
moment
doing
the
same
by
grace
who
had
followed
closely
in
elsie
s
wake
the
rest
of
their
party
soon
joined
them
then

the
little
fellow
in
a
tone
between
inquiry
and
assertion
ah
no
not
just
now
violet
answered
with
a
slight
sigh
for
she
loved
max
and
missed
his
cheery
presence
in
the
house
ah

exclaimed
presently
as
the
carriage
turned
into
the
driveway
and
everything
is
looking
oh
so
lovely
cried
lulu
clapping
her
hands
with
delight
and
there
is
marian
on
the

waiting
for
the
other
two
carriages

not

behind

been
arranged
that

turned
in
at

presently
all
had
alighted
and
were
one
after
the
other
warmly
greeting
marian
she
was
glad
to
learn
that
lilburn
had
been
invited
to
make
woodburn
his
home
for
some
weeks
and
had
accepted
the
invitation
so
that
she
would
see
much
of
him
for
a
time
at
least
and
become
better
acquainted
he
had
been
so
kind
to
her
that
she
felt
already
a
warm
affection
for
him

a
near
and
dear
relative
chapter

and
dinsmore
and
travilla
reached
philadelphia
safely
without
accident
or
detention
spent
a
few
days
with
their
relatives
there
then
being
urgently
invited
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
family
of
their
cousin
donald
brother
of
our
old
friend
mildred
wife
of
landreth
of
pleasant
plains
and
father
of
mary
keith
with
whom
edward
and
violet
spent
some
time
in
a
cottage
at
ocean
beach
in
the
summer
after
the
death
of
their
did
so
about
six
years
had
passed
since
then
some
of
mary
s
younger
brothers
and
sisters
had
grown
up
and
married
so
that
her
burdens
were
much
lightened
but
she
herself
was
still
single
and
at
home
in
her
father
s
house
time
seemed
to
have
stood
still
with
her
they
found
her
the
same
bright
cheery
girl
looking
scarcely
older
than
she
had
looked
six
years
ago
she
was
delighted
to
see
again
these
relatives
whom
she
had
met
and
learned
to
love
during
that
summer
in
the
cottage
by
the
sea
and
very
glad
to
hear
all
they
had
to
tell
of
the
cousins
who
had
helped
to
make
enjoyable
her
effort
at
housekeeping
then
and
there
she
had
many
questions
to
ask
about
them
and
the
little
ones
and
expressed
an
ardent
desire
to
see
them
all
again
to
which
her
cousin
elsie
replied
we
are
expecting
to
return
home
in
a
fortnight
or
a
little
sooner
and
will
be
glad
to
take
you
with
us
if
you
will
go
mary
will
you
not
dear
girl
cousin
elsie
how
very
kind
in
you
exclaimed
mary
both
tone
and
look
full
of
delight
but
she
added
with
a
doubtful
glance
at
her
mother
i
fear
i
could
hardly
be
spared
from
now
don
t
be
so
conceited
mary
keith
laughed
that
lady
with
a
mischievous
glance
into
the
flushed
eager
face
of
her
eldest
daughter
i
think
i
am
quite
capable
of
keeping
house
and
attending
to
all
family
affairs
without
a
particle
of
aid
from
you
so
if
cousin
elsie
wants
you
and
you
want
to
go
i
advise
you
to
set
to
work
at
once
at
your
your
wardrobe
in
perfect
order
and
adding
to
it
whatever
may
be
needed
oh
you
needn
t
look
doubtful
and
troubled
your
father
has
been
greatly
prospered
of
late
and
i
know
will
not
feel
any
necessity
or
inclination
to
deny
anything
desirable
to
the
good
daughter
who
has
been
a
very
great
help
and
comfort
to
him
and
me
through
years
of
toil
and
mary
was
affected
even
to
tears
o
mother
how
good
and
kind
in
you
to
say
all
that
she
faltered
i
have
done
no
more
than
my
even
so
much
i
possibly
your
father
and
i
may
be
as
capable
of
judging
of
that
as
yourself
returned
keith
in
the
same
tone
of
careless
gayety
she
had
used
before
and
we
we
were
talking
the
matter
over
only
the
other
our
eldest
daughter
deserves
and
needs
some
weeks
of
recreation
this
summer
we
were
discussing
the
comparative
merits
of
sea
and
mountain
air
but
finally
decided
to
leave
the
selection
to
yourself
and
now
doubtless
cousin
elsie
s
kind
invitation
will
decide
you
in
favor
of
a
trip
to
the
south
even
in
spite
of
its
climate
being
less
suitable
for
the
warm
weather
than
our
it
will
be
a
change
for
her
at
all
events
elsie
said
and
when
we
come
north
again
as
we
expect
to
do
in
a
few
weeks
we
may
i
think
hope
to
return
her
to
you
rested
and
invigorated
or
still
better
we
will
hope
to
take
her
with
your
consent
with
us
to
the
for
a
good
rest
there
before
returning
her
to
keith
and
mary
returned
warm
thanks
for
this
second
invitation
but
it
was
not
at
that
time
definitely
settled
whether
or
not
it
could
or
would
be
finally
accepted
ah
mother
dear
i
see
now
why
you
insisted
this
spring
on
my
buying
and
having
made
up
more
and
handsomer
dresses
than
ever
i
had
in
one
season
before
mary
said
presently
with
an
affectionate
look
and
smile
into
keith
s
pleasant
and
still
comely
face
yes
it
is
always
wise
to
be
ready
for
sudden
emergencies
returned
the
mother
playfully
and
i
think
you
can
easily
be
ready
for
a
visit
to
ion
by
the
time
cousin
elsie
will
be
on
her
way
home
from
our
plan
is
to
start
for
home
in
about
a
week
elsie
said
as
the
commencement
will
be
over
by
that
time
and
my
boys
harold
and
herbert
ready
to
accompany
you
are
making
us
a
very
short
visit
cousin
elsie
remarked
keith
i
hope
when
you
come
up
north
again
you
will
piece
it
out
with
a
much
longer
thank
you
returned
elsie
i
should
enjoy
doing
so
and
perhaps
may
be
able
to
but
our
plans
for
the
season
are
not
then
turning
to
mary
our
party
is
to
pass
through
philadelphia
on
our
return
after
the
commencement
can
you
not
arrange
to
meet
us
there
so
that
we
may
travel
the
rest
of
the
way
to
ion
in
company
i
think
so
was
the
reply
can
i
not
mamma
i
see
nothing
to
prevent
said
her
mother
we
will
have
you
there
in
season
if
our
cousins
will
let
us
know
what
train
you
are
to
dinsmore
came
in
at
that
moment
and
with
his
good
help
the
arrangements
were
presently
satisfactorily
completed
to
the
great
delight
of
harold
and
herbert
their
grandfather
and
mother
arrived
safely
in
princeton
on
the
evening
of
the
day
before
commencement
the
young
men
though
looking
somewhat
overworked
yet
seemed
in
good
health
and
good
spirits
they
had
passed
successfully
through
their
examination
and
the
next
day
were
graduated
with
high
honors
both
grandfather
and
mother
showed
by
their
looks
manner
and
words
of
commendation
and
congratulation
that
they
were
highly
gratified
and
not
a
little
proud
of
their
bright
intelligent
industrious
lads
and
now
my
sons
i
suppose
you
are
quite
ready
for
home
their
grandfather
said
when
the
congratulations
were
over
almost
ready
to
start
for
it
grandpa
harold
replied
with
a
joyous
laugh
then
turning
to
his
mother
mamma
i
have
a
request
to
make
and
i
do
not
think
you
or
grandpa
will
object
to
its
being
not
if
it
is
anything
reasonable
my
dear
boy
she
returned
are
you
desirous
to
invite
some
friend
to
accompany
us
to
ion
ah
mother
mine
he
laughed
you
certainly
are
good
at
guessing
yes
i
should
like
to
give
a
warm
invitation
from
grandpa
you
and
ourselves
to
a
classmate
whose
home
is
closed
at
present
his
parents
being
in
europe
for
the
health
of
his
mother
who
is
a
sad
invalid
william
croly
is
his
we
call
he
is
as
good
bright
and
lovable
a
fellow
as
could
be
found
he
is
indeed
mamma
said
herbert
i
esteem
him
as
highly
as
harold
then
i
think
he
will
be
a
very
welcome
guest
at
ion
travilla
returned
with
a
look
of
inquiry
at
her
father
as
if
she
would
consult
his
wishes
as
well
as
her
own
and
those
of
her
sons
i
should
ask
him
by
all
means
said
dinsmore
i
judge
from
the
recommendation
just
given
that
he
will
prove
a
pleasant
guest
besides
the
bible
bids
us
use
hospitality
without
and
that
is
one
thing
i
am
sure
you
and
mother
love
to
do
grandpa
returned
herbert
giving
a
look
of
affectionate
admiration
to
first
one
then
the
other
yes
it
is
a
great
pleasure
therefore
hardly
meritorious
his
grandfather
said
with
a
smile
then
i
may
bring
croly
and
introduce
him
may
i
not
asked
harold
a
ready
assent
was
given
in
reply
harold
hurried
away
and
presently
returned
bringing
with
him
a
young
man
who
had
a
very
pleasant
bright
face
and
refined
gentlemanly
manners
dinsmore
and
his
daughter
gave
him
a
pleasant
greeting
and
kindly
shake
of
the
hand
as
harold
introduced
him
and
after
a
little
a
cordial
invitation
to
accompany
them
on
their
return
to
ion
and
remain
until
they
should
all
come
north
again
for
the
summer
croly
was
evidently
delighted
with
the
invitation
and
it
did
not
take
much
urging
to
induce
him
to
accept
it
that
evening
they
all
journeyed
to
philadelphia
where
they
were
joined
by
dinsmore
and
mary
keith
and
the
next
morning
the
whole
party
started
southward
a
pleasant
jovial
company
they
met
with
no
accident
or
detention
and
were
greeted
with
the
warmest
of
welcomes
on
their
arrival
at
ion
at
an
early
hour
on
the
second
day
they
took
some
hours
of
rest
and
sleep
then
were
able
to
enjoy
the
family
gathering
which
had
been
planned
by
elsie
s
sons
and
daughters
to
celebrate
the
safe
return
of
their
loved
mother
and
grandparents
from
their
visit
to
the
north
and
the
of
the
young
graduates
the
children
and
young
people
were
included
in
the
invitation
and
not
a
single
one
failed
to
be
present
from
woodburn
the
oaks
pinegrove
roselands
the
laurels
and
fairview
they
came
forming
of
themselves
alone
a
goodly
company
full
of
mirth
and
jollity
which
was
in
no
way
checked
by
any
of
their
elders
with
whom
they
remained
for
a
time
hanging
about
those
who
had
been
absent
from
home
particularly
grandma
elsie
and
next
to
her
the
young
uncles
who
had
been
away
so
long
that
they
seemed
almost
as
strangers
to
the
very
little
ones
pleasant
and
attractive
strangers
however
inclined
to
make
much
of
their
little
nieces
and
nephews
a
business
in
which
their
college
friend
will
croly
took
an
active
part
almost
every
one
presently
forsook
the
rooms
and
verandas
to
sit
beneath
the
trees
or
wander
here
and
there
about
the
beautiful
grounds
visiting
the
gardens
and
the
lovely
little
lakelet
a
handsome
rowboat
was
there
and
the
young
men
invited
the
older
girls
to
take
a
row
around
the
pretty
little
sheet
of
water
marian
mcalpine
evelyn
leland
rosie
travilla
and
the
two
dinsmore
girls
from
the
oaks
accepted
but
lulu
raymond
who
was
with
them
regretfully
declined
saying
she
knew
papa
would
be
displeased
if
she
went
without
his
knowledge
and
consent
why
lu
you
are
growing
remarkably
good
and
obedient
laughed
sidney
dinsmore
for
which
we
should
all
honor
her
said
harold
the
captain
is
one
of
the
best
and
kindest
of
fathers
and
his
requirements
are
never
oh
of
course
not
laughed
sidney
only
i
m
glad
he
hasn
t
the
care
of
me
and
control
of
my
i
m
glad
that
he
has
of
me
and
mine
returned
lulu
rather
hotly
as
the
boat
pushed
out
into
the
water
leaving
her
standing
alone
on
the
shore
gazing
wistfully
after
it
how
delightful
it
looks
she
sighed
to
herself
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
the
possibility
of
such
an
invitation
and
got
papa
s
permission
you
did
right
little
girl
and
i
am
very
sure
that
when
your
papa
hears
of
it
he
will
commend
you
in
a
way
that
will
give
you
far
more
pleasure
than
the
row
could
have
done
if
taken
without
his
permission
said
a
voice
from
behind
her
and
turning
to
look
for
the
speaker
she
found
lilburn
close
at
hand
thank
you
sir
she
replied
with
a
pleasant
smile
i
wanted
badly
to
go
yet
i
know
i
couldn
t
have
enjoyed
it
without
papa
s
i
should
hope
not
indeed
returned
the
old
gentleman
oh
lilburn
cried
lulu
struck
with
a
sudden
thought
there
are
several
in
our
company
here
this
afternoon
who
know
nothing
of
your
ventriloquial
powers
can
t
you
think
of
some
way
of
using
them
that
will
puzzle
the
strangers
and
furnish
amusement
for
us
all
suppose
we
consider
that
and
i
he
returned
with
a
smile
have
you
any
suggestion
to
make
how
would
it
do
to
make
them
hear
trumpets
or
bugles
or
something
of
that
kind
in
the
woods
near
by
as
you
did
to
the
ku
klux
years
ago
she
asked
in
eager
tones
adding
grandma
elsie
has
told
us
the
story
of
their
attack
on
this
place
when
mamma
vi
was
quite
a
little
ah
yes
i
remember
he
said
with
a
slight
smile
let
us
sit
down
here
leading
her
to
a
rustic
seat
near
at
hand
and
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
the
oh
i
m
glad
now
i
was
left
behind
lulu
exclaimed
as
she
took
the
offered
seat
and
turned
an
excited
expectant
face
toward
her
companion
for
a
minute
or
more
he
seemed
buried
in
thought
then
suddenly
the
clear
notes
of
a
bugle
seemed
to
come
from
behind
a
clump
of
trees
a
few
rods
distant
from
where
they
sat
lulu
was
startled
for
an
instant
and
turned
in
that
direction
half
expecting
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
bugler
then
she
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
softly
oh
that
s
lovely
she
said
they
ll
be
sure
there
s
somebody
there
and
wonder
who
it
can
be
yes
see
how
they
are
turning
their
heads
in
that
can
you
see
the
expression
o
ony
o
their
countenances
bit
lassie
i
canna
for
my
eyes
are
growing
yes
sir
i
can
see
that
miss
keith
looks
startled
and
astonished
and
seems
to
be
questioning
uncle
harold
and
that
croly
is
laughing
and
trying
his
best
to
catch
a
peep
at
the
trumpeter
the
others
i
think
look
as
if
they
are
trying
to
keep
from
laughing
i
dare
say
they
see
you
here
sir
and
can
guess
what
it
means
oh
there
s
our
prince
he
seems
to
be
in
search
of
the
even
as
lulu
spoke
she
was
startled
by
another
seemingly
directly
behind
them
or
from
the
branches
of
the
tree
under
which
they
sat
oh
she
exclaimed
turning
quickly
to
look
behind
her
then
with
a
merry
laugh
i
wasn
t
expecting
your
bugler
to
come
so
very
near
but
the
concluding
words
were
almost
drowned
in
prince
s
loud
bark
as
he
came
bounding
toward
them
evidently
in
search
of
the
intruding
bugler
find
him
prince
find
him
as
fast
as
you
can
and
teach
him
not
to
intrude
into
the
ion
grounds
laughed
lulu
but
the
bugler
s
notes
had
already
died
away
and
prince
s
bark
changed
to
a
low
growl
as
he
searched
for
him
here
and
there
but
vainly
so
you
have
a
bugler
on
the
estate
eh
croly
was
saying
with
an
inquiring
glance
at
harold
one
of
your
darkies
i
presume
they
are
a
musical
race
i
they
are
harold
replied
with
unmoved
countenance
i
thought
the
notes
musical
and
pleasant
observed
miss
keith
but
they
do
not
seem
to
have
taken
the
fancy
of
your
fine
fellow
by
the
not
our
dog
but
belongs
to
max
raymond
said
herbert
no
he
does
not
seem
to
fancy
the
intruder
whoever
he
may
hark
cried
rosie
the
bugler
is
at
it
and
this
time
it
is
a
scotch
air
remarked
mary
keith
how
soft
and
sweet
it
sounds
but
it
comes
from
quite
another
quarter
yet
i
do
not
know
how
the
bugler
can
have
changed
his
position
so
entirely
without
any
of
us
catching
sight
of
him
as
he
it
does
seem
odd
said
croly
but
his
words
were
nearly
drowned
in
the
loud
bark
of
prince
as
he
rushed
in
the
new
direction
with
evident
intent
to
oust
the
intruder
this
time
his
effort
was
however
as
complete
a
failure
as
the
former
one
the
notes
of
the
bugle
died
softly
away
the
dog
sniffed
about
the
tree
from
which
they
had
seemed
to
come
but
finally
gave
it
up
and
trotted
away
in
the
direction
of
the
house
point
out
that
bugler
to
me
when
we
come
across
him
won
t
you
harold
really
i
never
knew
that
we
had
a
bugler
among
our
servants
returned
harold
evasively
nor
i
said
herbert
but
taking
out
his
watch
it
is
nearing
and
as
we
are
likely
to
find
plenty
of
opportunities
for
this
kind
of
sport
i
think
we
had
better
now
return
to
the
no
one
objected
the
boat
was
immediately
headed
for
the
wharf
and
all
had
presently
landed
and
were
sauntering
along
by
the
way
that
they
had
come
lilburn
and
lulu
accompanying
them
chapter
viii
what
in
the
world
has
become
of
that
bugler
queried
croly
peering
among
the
trees
and
shrubs
were
you
wanting
to
speak
to
him
croly
asked
rosie
gravely
but
with
some
difficulty
restraining
a
desire
to
laugh
no
not
particularly
but
i
have
a
slight
curiosity
to
see
him
and
ask
for
another
specimen
or
so
of
his
he
seems
to
be
skilful
in
making
his
disappearance
doesn
t
he
laughed
rosie
he
does
and
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
give
up
the
hope
of
making
his
acquaintance
returned
croly
but
it
is
really
singular
that
no
one
of
us
has
been
able
to
get
sight
of
it
is
indeed
assented
mary
keith
i
have
been
watching
closely
but
without
obtaining
so
much
as
a
glimpse
of
well
cousin
don
t
despair
perhaps
it
will
be
better
luck
next
time
herbert
said
laughingly
ah
we
are
just
in
time
for
i
see
they
are
setting
the
tables
beneath
the
oh
that
s
good
cried
lulu
i
think
it
is
such
good
fun
to
eat
out
of
then
aside
to
lilburn
o
cousin
ronald
can
t
you
do
some
of
those
things
you
did
at
cousin
betty
s
wedding
it
would
be
such
wait
and
see
bit
lassie
the
old
gentleman
returned
with
a
smile
just
then
walter
came
bounding
to
meet
them
i
m
glad
to
see
you
he
said
half
breathlessly
i
ve
been
hunting
all
around
for
you
because
tea
is
nearly
ready
and
zoe
was
afraid
you
might
not
be
here
in
eh
laddie
laughed
his
brother
herbert
so
you
forgot
did
you
that
we
had
appetites
and
watches
first
to
remind
us
of
our
need
of
food
the
second
to
tell
us
when
it
was
likely
to
be
i
thought
it
kinder
to
hunt
you
up
than
to
trust
to
appetites
and
watches
to
bring
you
in
good
season
to
get
everything
at
its
best
returned
walter
then
stepping
close
to
lilburn
s
side
he
asked
in
an
undertone
cousin
ronald
please
won
t
you
make
some
of
the
same
kind
of
fun
for
us
that
you
did
at
cousin
betty
s
wedding
at
that
lilburn
laughed
saying
well
well
laddie
you
and
your
niece
here
you
re
lulu
s
uncle
aren
t
you
seem
to
be
of
one
mind
in
regard
to
that
matter
we
ll
see
what
can
be
walter
s
niece
laughed
lulu
he
s
younger
than
i
am
and
would
be
a
little
uncle
for
so
i
would
laughed
walter
in
turn
but
if
your
father
is
my
brother
i
suppose
you
must
be
my
niece
and
you
d
better
mind
what
i
say
to
i
it
suits
me
she
replied
in
merry
retort
they
were
now
nearing
that
part
of
the
lawn
where
they
had
left
the
older
members
of
the
party
and
the
little
ones
ah
i
am
glad
to
see
you
said
zoe
coming
forward
to
meet
them
for
it
is
nearly
time
for
the
summons
to
yes
we
hope
we
have
not
kept
you
waiting
returned
several
voices
oh
no
she
replied
cheerily
you
are
just
in
good
season
i
heard
your
father
inquiring
where
you
were
only
a
moment
since
oh
did
you
aunt
zoe
well
i
ll
tell
him
replied
lulu
hurrying
away
in
his
direction
for
she
could
see
him
seated
under
a
tree
at
some
little
distance
with
and
dinsmore
grandma
elsie
mamma
vi
and
several
others
lulu
stole
up
behind
him
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
laid
her
cheek
to
his
ah
he
said
taking
hold
of
the
small
white
hands
drawing
her
around
in
front
of
him
and
seating
her
on
his
knee
where
has
this
eldest
daughter
of
mine
been
for
the
last
hour
or
so
down
by
the
lake
with
the
older
ones
papa
she
replied
softly
stroking
his
beard
with
one
hand
and
smiling
archly
into
the
eyes
gazing
so
fondly
upon
her
i
thought
you
were
always
willing
that
i
should
go
about
the
grounds
here
without
asking
special
yes
so
i
am
provided
you
do
not
go
on
the
water
without
my
knowledge
and
i
wanted
to
but
i
didn
t
was
her
reply
you
didn
t
think
i
would
papa
when
you
had
forbidden
me
certainly
not
daughter
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
indeed
if
i
could
not
trust
you
out
of
my
their
conversation
had
been
carried
on
in
an
undertone
and
the
others
were
not
listening
but
chatting
among
themselves
in
the
mean
while
cousin
ronald
had
drawn
zoe
aside
and
held
a
moment
s
conversation
with
her
which
seemed
to
interest
and
amuse
her
then
edward
joined
them
zoe
seemed
to
repeat
to
him
what
the
old
gentleman
had
said
edward
responded
with
a
smile
then
the
three
separated
and
the
young
host
and
mother
having
resigned
to
them
her
duties
in
that
line
for
the
to
seat
their
guests
at
the
tables
and
servants
appeared
bearing
the
viands
prepared
for
their
entertainment
mary
keith
marian
mcalpine
and
will
croly
were
all
three
at
one
and
the
same
table
lilburn
harold
herbert
rosie
and
evelyn
leland
sharing
it
with
them
the
last
two
and
the
brothers
exchanged
furtive
glances
of
amused
expectancy
and
dinsmore
grandma
elsie
walter
and
the
raymonds
occupied
the
next
two
the
rest
of
the
company
others
not
far
distant
almost
every
one
seemed
in
gay
spirits
and
all
were
blessed
with
good
appetites
the
satisfying
of
which
kept
them
very
busy
for
a
time
though
not
to
the
entire
exclusion
of
mirthful
chat
and
laughter
but
when
the
more
substantial
dishes
had
been
duly
discussed
carried
away
and
replaced
by
cakes
fruits
and
ices
in
a
moment
of
comparative
silence
there
came
a
sudden
sound
as
of
flapping
of
wings
overhead
followed
by
a
shrill
polly
wants
a
cake
it
s
and
polly
why
polly
how
did
you
get
out
and
fly
all
the
way
here
cried
lulu
in
astonishment
and
looking
up
as
did
almost
every
one
else
among
the
branches
overhead
i
didn
t
think
you
knew
the
way
and
there
is
plenty
for
you
to
eat
at
where
are
you
polly
s
hungry
polly
wants
a
cup
of
coffee
came
in
return
in
what
seemed
evidently
polly
s
own
shrill
tones
go
home
and
get
it
then
laughed
lulu
you
weren
t
invited
here
and
people
always
wait
to
be
asked
before
they
go
polly
s
hungry
poor
old
old
soul
came
in
response
why
where
is
she
queried
grace
peering
up
among
the
branches
of
the
tree
from
which
the
sound
seemed
to
come
i
don
t
know
said
lulu
i
can
t
just
see
her
but
she
has
a
good
up
there
where
the
branches
and
leaves
are
so
thick
but
how
she
found
her
way
here
i
can
t
think
oh
as
she
suddenly
caught
sight
of
lilburn
s
face
and
noted
the
twinkle
of
fun
in
his
eye
perhaps
you
have
given
her
too
much
liberty
lulu
her
father
said
in
so
grave
a
tone
she
was
at
loss
to
decide
whether
or
not
his
suspicions
too
had
been
aroused
so
you
have
a
miss
lu
quite
a
talker
too
said
croly
i
should
like
to
make
her
acquaintance
can
you
not
tempt
her
to
come
down
i
ll
try
to
keep
her
at
home
after
this
papa
said
lulu
but
shall
i
see
if
i
can
coax
her
to
come
down
now
you
may
if
you
choose
he
answered
with
unmoved
gravity
tell
her
she
can
have
a
cup
of
coffee
and
anything
else
she
wants
if
she
will
come
added
grandma
elsie
with
a
look
of
amusement
so
lulu
called
polly
polly
come
here
and
you
shall
have
a
cup
of
the
nicest
coffee
and
anything
else
you
then
for
a
minute
or
more
everybody
seemed
to
be
looking
and
listening
but
polly
neither
answered
nor
showed
herself
and
at
length
baby
ned
broke
the
silence
with
i
spect
polly
s
done
way
to
our
house
adain
she
won
t
tum
when
lu
talls
she
seems
to
have
taken
her
departure
very
suddenly
remarked
rosie
strange
she
should
do
so
if
she
were
really
as
hungry
as
she
i
don
t
b
lieve
she
was
aunt
rosie
said
little
elsie
for
nobody
ever
gets
starved
at
our
house
cause
papa
always
buys
plenty
for
everybody
to
it
s
good
food
too
and
well
cooked
added
grace
i
think
that
is
all
true
croly
and
i
hope
you
will
come
and
see
for
yourself
laughed
violet
hush
hush
hush
you
talk
too
much
polly
came
in
a
shrill
scream
apparently
from
the
top
of
the
tree
then
in
a
coaxing
complaining
tone
poor
polly
s
hungry
it
s
polly
wants
a
biscuit
polly
wants
a
cup
of
why
she
s
quite
a
talker
i
d
really
like
to
get
a
sight
of
her
said
croly
making
a
more
determined
effort
than
before
to
do
so
humph
savin
all
your
pity
for
hungry
birds
never
a
bit
of
it
to
give
a
starvin
human
creeter
snarled
a
man
s
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
a
clump
of
bushes
a
yard
or
two
in
croly
s
rear
every
head
at
once
turned
in
that
direction
but
the
speaker
seemed
invisible
it
was
grandma
elsie
who
replied
there
is
abundance
of
food
here
and
i
would
have
no
one
starve
or
suffer
at
all
from
hunger
step
up
to
the
table
and
your
wants
shall
be
there
is
no
empty
seat
at
your
table
ma
am
snarled
the
voice
true
she
returned
but
there
are
abundance
of
seats
near
at
hand
and
you
can
carry
your
food
to
one
of
them
when
you
have
received
it
and
there
sit
and
eat
at
your
why
where
on
earth
is
the
fellow
asked
croly
of
harold
speaking
in
an
undertone
i
can
not
catch
so
much
as
a
glimpse
of
it
really
looks
very
mysterious
returned
harold
with
difficulty
repressing
a
smile
what
had
better
be
done
about
it
do
you
think
surely
that
is
for
your
mother
to
say
returned
croly
but
if
i
were
in
her
place
i
should
have
the
grounds
thoroughly
searched
for
that
impudent
fellow
who
is
probably
a
thieving
hardly
i
think
said
harold
for
they
are
somewhat
scarce
hereabouts
at
least
we
seldom
see
ah
then
you
are
fortunate
in
that
but
how
odd
that
both
bird
and
man
should
be
invisible
exclaimed
mary
keith
i
must
own
that
i
can
not
understand
no
remarked
herbert
gravely
there
are
many
things
happening
in
this
world
that
we
can
not
but
it
surprises
me
to
see
how
easily
you
take
all
this
now
i
should
want
to
hunt
him
out
and
send
him
about
his
business
before
he
does
any
perhaps
that
might
be
the
better
plan
returned
harold
here
prince
as
max
s
dog
was
seen
slowly
approaching
hunt
out
that
fellow
yonder
pointing
to
the
clump
of
bushes
from
which
the
voice
had
seemed
to
come
sick
him
sick
him
at
that
prince
pricked
up
his
ears
wagged
his
tail
and
rushed
toward
the
bushes
barking
furiously
but
only
for
a
moment
or
two
evidently
finding
no
one
there
he
came
slowly
back
with
lowered
tail
and
drooping
ears
plainly
feeling
that
he
had
been
sold
and
mortified
that
he
had
fallen
into
the
trap
laid
for
his
unwary
feet
poor
fellow
said
herbert
that
chap
seems
as
hard
to
find
as
the
bugler
was
a
while
ago
but
never
did
your
take
him
to
the
kitchen
sam
and
comfort
him
with
a
good
dinner
said
grandma
elsie
to
a
servant
well
croly
what
is
it
laughed
herbert
you
really
look
as
if
you
had
put
on
your
thinking
yes
so
i
have
returned
croly
glancing
searchingly
about
and
the
conclusion
i
ve
reached
is
that
we
must
have
a
ventriloquist
among
us
the
next
question
is
who
is
he
a
ventriloquist
exclaimed
mary
keith
how
delightful
such
fun
as
we
shall
have
if
that
is
really
the
case
but
who
can
it
be
you
captain
looking
searchingly
at
him
i
should
be
very
willing
to
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
could
i
do
so
truthfully
cousin
mary
he
replied
in
a
playful
tone
oh
no
i
think
it
can
hardly
be
the
captain
said
croly
he
was
not
down
at
the
lake
with
us
and
doubtless
the
invisible
bugler
was
the
ventriloquist
or
the
ventriloquist
the
bugler
whichever
way
you
prefer
to
put
there
i
dare
say
you
are
right
she
returned
now
harold
it
was
you
wasn
t
it
you
may
just
as
well
own
up
first
as
but
really
mary
i
have
nothing
to
own
up
to
he
said
you
are
by
no
means
on
the
right
then
who
could
it
have
been
but
you
herbert
she
queried
turning
laughing
eyes
upon
him
i
can
truthfully
aver
that
it
was
not
i
cousin
mary
returned
herbert
with
grave
earnestness
though
there
was
a
twinkle
of
fun
in
his
eye
that
half
convinced
her
he
was
in
jest
she
wore
a
puzzled
expression
for
a
moment
then
turning
suddenly
to
lulu
i
wonder
now
if
it
can
have
been
you
she
said
giving
the
child
a
searching
look
oh
no
indeed
miss
mary
laughed
lulu
i
only
wish
i
could
say
yes
for
there
s
nothing
i
d
like
better
than
to
be
able
to
make
such
sport
for
myself
and
but
you
know
who
it
is
why
do
you
think
so
miss
mary
something
in
your
look
and
manner
tells
me
that
you
know
all
about
it
besides
you
were
on
the
shore
while
we
in
the
boat
heard
the
sounds
of
the
bugle
apparently
coming
from
among
the
really
now
miss
mary
i
don
t
see
that
all
that
proves
anything
against
me
laughed
lulu
do
you
think
it
does
papa
not
at
all
replied
her
father
a
ventriloquist
on
the
boat
might
i
think
make
it
seem
to
others
that
his
voice
came
from
among
the
on
the
shore
but
really
croly
turning
toward
the
young
man
as
he
spoke
i
do
not
see
that
you
have
any
positive
proof
that
there
is
a
ventriloquist
why
sir
did
we
not
hear
a
strange
voice
speaking
apparently
from
yonder
clump
of
bushes
and
on
examination
find
that
there
was
no
one
there
true
but
who
shall
say
it
may
not
have
been
some
one
very
nimble
and
fleet
of
foot
who
made
his
escape
all
too
quickly
to
be
caught
well
sir
returned
croly
slowly
and
with
meditative
air
i
suppose
that
is
just
possible
perhaps
too
the
same
fellow
was
the
bugler
whom
we
all
heard
but
none
of
us
could
edward
said
dinsmore
gravely
you
may
as
well
have
the
premises
searched
for
that
fellow
for
one
so
adroit
at
suddenly
disappearing
from
sight
might
readily
enter
the
house
and
carry
off
yes
sir
i
ll
see
that
he
does
not
edward
replied
with
equal
gravity
but
carefully
abstaining
from
an
exchange
of
glances
with
lilburn
take
care
that
he
doesn
t
steal
your
parrot
lu
said
zoe
she
s
worth
stealing
and
as
she
is
such
a
good
talker
i
d
be
loath
to
lose
her
if
she
were
indeed
so
should
i
exclaimed
lulu
i
wouldn
t
part
with
her
for
a
great
deal
especially
as
she
was
a
present
from
we
will
be
careful
not
to
leave
her
here
when
we
go
home
said
the
captain
i
hope
you
are
not
afraid
to
trust
her
with
us
captain
said
zoe
i
assure
you
we
would
be
good
to
her
and
i
dare
say
she
would
prove
a
great
amusement
to
my
i
have
not
a
doubt
that
you
would
treat
her
well
sister
zoe
replied
the
captain
and
if
lulu
is
inclined
to
lend
her
for
a
few
days
i
shall
not
then
i
ll
not
take
any
trouble
to
hunt
her
up
when
we
re
ready
to
go
home
said
lulu
all
had
now
satisfied
their
appetites
the
tables
were
presently
forsaken
and
the
company
gathered
in
groups
here
and
there
under
the
trees
some
amusing
themselves
in
playing
games
others
with
conversation
but
it
had
been
a
long
june
day
and
before
the
sun
had
fairly
set
most
of
them
were
on
their
homeward
way
for
and
dinsmore
and
grandma
elsie
hardly
rested
after
their
journey
began
to
look
weary
lilburn
at
the
urgent
invitation
of
the
captain
and
violet
returned
with
them
to
woodburn
to
complete
his
visit
there
which
they
said
had
not
been
half
long
enough
marian
too
was
with
them
so
that
they
were
quite
a
little
party
grace
and
the
little
ones
went
directly
to
bed
on
reaching
home
but
the
elder
ones
passed
a
pleasant
hour
or
two
on
the
veranda
before
returning
chapter
ix
mother
dear
harold
said
as
he
kissed
her
on
that
first
evening
at
home
after
their
return
from
princeton
herbert
and
i
are
decidedly
hungry
for
one
of
the
good
old
talks
with
you
but
you
are
too
weary
may
we
come
to
you
early
in
the
morning
for
the
dear
old
of
bible
study
and
private
talk
before
breakfast
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
you
do
so
my
dear
boys
she
replied
regarding
them
with
eyes
beaming
with
mother
love
and
pride
i
have
been
looking
forward
with
longing
for
the
confidential
talks
with
my
boys
which
have
always
been
so
sweet
to
me
especially
in
regard
to
your
plans
for
future
usefulness
as
workers
in
the
master
s
yes
mamma
that
is
one
of
the
principal
matters
about
which
we
wish
to
consult
best
dearest
wisest
earthly
friend
said
herbert
lifting
her
hand
to
his
lips
for
who
so
wise
so
loving
or
so
desirous
to
help
each
of
us
to
use
time
and
talents
in
a
way
to
make
them
most
helpful
in
the
master
s
service
i
can
not
lay
claim
to
any
great
amount
of
wisdom
my
dear
boys
travilla
returned
with
a
smile
but
am
certain
no
one
can
love
you
better
or
feel
a
greater
desire
than
i
to
see
you
earnest
efficient
workers
for
christ
i
want
very
much
to
talk
over
with
you
your
plans
for
the
future
and
think
there
could
be
no
better
time
for
doing
so
than
that
early
morning
hour
when
we
shall
be
more
secure
from
interruption
than
at
almost
any
other
now
and
may
you
rest
sweetly
and
peacefully
on
this
first
night
at
home
after
your
long
may
you
also
dear
mother
precious
little
mother
said
harold
passing
an
arm
about
her
waist
and
smiling
down
with
ardent
affection
into
her
still
fair
sweet
face
i
remember
that
i
used
to
look
up
at
your
beautiful
face
regarding
you
as
a
protector
but
i
feel
that
now
i
am
enough
and
strong
enough
to
defend
you
should
any
be
so
base
as
to
attempt
to
do
you
ah
my
dear
boy
fortunately
no
one
has
i
think
any
such
desire
she
said
returning
his
smile
yet
it
is
very
pleasant
to
feel
that
i
have
so
many
strong
young
arms
to
support
and
shield
me
twas
very
pleasant
in
former
years
to
be
the
protector
of
my
little
ones
and
it
is
not
less
pleasant
now
to
find
them
so
ready
to
return
my
love
and
care
but
now
go
to
your
beds
for
you
need
rest
and
sleep
to
keep
you
in
condition
for
the
arduous
duty
of
which
we
have
just
been
speaking
she
added
with
playful
look
and
tone
how
early
can
we
come
without
disturbing
you
mother
mine
asked
herbert
snatching
another
kiss
as
harold
released
her
from
his
arms
at
seven
if
that
is
not
too
early
she
replied
rosie
and
walter
are
usually
with
me
about
seven
and
the
is
they
were
at
her
door
the
next
morning
exactly
at
the
hour
named
and
found
her
ready
to
receive
them
a
pleasant
chat
followed
the
lads
telling
her
freely
of
their
plans
and
desires
in
regard
to
their
for
diligent
workers
they
intended
to
be
harold
still
clung
to
his
early
choice
of
the
medical
profession
and
herbert
as
devotedly
attached
to
him
as
ever
and
thinking
he
would
not
prefer
any
other
employment
had
decided
to
study
medicine
also
unless
his
mother
should
disapprove
no
she
said
when
he
asked
the
question
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
together
so
unless
you
herbert
have
a
stronger
inclination
for
some
other
employment
i
shall
be
more
than
satisfied
to
see
you
a
physician
always
provided
you
are
a
good
one
she
added
playfully
is
it
your
wish
my
sons
to
return
shortly
to
philadelphia
and
pursue
your
medical
studies
there
not
immediately
mother
harold
replied
we
were
talking
the
matter
over
with
cousin
arthur
last
night
and
he
being
willing
to
undertake
the
business
of
instructing
us
our
plan
is
to
stay
at
home
with
you
for
some
time
studying
with
him
that
is
if
you
are
satisfied
to
have
us
do
ah
i
am
much
more
than
glad
and
thankful
at
the
thought
of
again
enjoying
daily
intercourse
with
these
two
dear
sons
who
have
been
so
long
away
from
me
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
but
just
now
you
both
need
rest
and
recreation
you
must
have
an
outing
somewhere
for
the
next
month
or
two
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
go
with
me
to
or
hope
to
bring
you
back
refreshed
and
invigorated
for
your
studies
and
such
work
for
the
master
as
you
may
find
in
this
thank
you
mother
dear
returned
harold
you
have
made
out
a
programme
that
seems
most
inviting
i
for
one
feel
that
rest
and
recreation
for
a
time
will
be
very
enjoyable
and
work
afterward
much
more
so
than
it
could
be
at
i
also
said
herbert
and
it
is
certainly
right
to
take
rest
when
needed
for
the
master
himself
said
to
his
disciples
when
they
were
weary
come
ye
yourselves
apart
into
a
desert
place
and
rest
yes
assented
his
mother
and
we
shall
accomplish
more
in
the
end
by
taking
needed
rest
yet
with
a
smiling
glance
at
herbert
we
must
be
on
our
guard
against
too
much
in
that
the
young
man
colored
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
his
face
wearing
a
slightly
mortified
expression
mother
dear
he
said
presently
i
hope
i
have
in
a
measure
at
least
overcome
my
natural
inclination
to
my
dear
boy
i
hope
and
believe
so
she
said
in
return
else
you
could
hardly
have
passed
so
good
an
examination
as
you
indeed
mother
he
has
been
really
a
hard
student
harold
said
and
i
think
will
undoubtedly
show
himself
such
when
we
begin
our
course
of
i
believe
he
will
she
responded
with
a
loving
smile
into
herbert
s
face
and
laying
a
hand
tenderly
upon
his
i
hope
to
see
you
both
eminent
in
your
chosen
profession
and
doing
good
to
the
bodies
and
souls
of
your
i
think
there
are
few
more
useful
men
in
the
world
than
our
cousin
arthur
conly
and
few
who
are
more
loved
and
respected
than
he
we
all
love
him
and
have
great
confidence
in
his
i
have
respected
and
loved
him
ever
since
i
can
remember
remarked
herbert
feelingly
and
can
never
cease
to
feel
grateful
to
him
as
god
s
instrument
in
the
saving
of
my
mother
s
yes
she
said
i
can
never
forget
his
kindness
at
that
critical
time
in
my
life
and
i
believe
we
have
all
loved
him
even
better
since
that
than
i
think
you
are
right
about
that
mother
i
know
you
are
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
harold
said
tears
starting
to
his
eyes
ah
when
we
heard
of
the
danger
and
suffering
you
had
passed
through
we
both
felt
that
life
without
our
mother
would
scarcely
be
a
just
then
rosie
and
walter
came
in
looking
bright
and
happy
ah
mamma
it
is
so
delightful
to
have
you
at
home
again
exclaimed
the
former
we
missed
you
sadly
kind
as
everybody
was
to
us
added
walter
putting
his
arm
round
her
neck
and
gazing
with
ardent
affection
into
her
eyes
then
kissing
her
on
cheek
and
lips
i
suppose
it
was
a
little
hard
for
my
baby
boy
to
do
without
his
mother
she
returned
laughingly
holding
him
in
a
close
embrace
ah
mamma
i
can
take
that
name
from
you
easily
enough
because
i
know
it
is
only
your
pet
name
for
your
youngest
son
but
i
d
be
vexed
enough
if
anybody
else
should
call
me
a
you
might
well
laugh
at
the
absurdity
if
any
one
should
walter
harold
remarked
regarding
his
little
brother
with
an
affectionate
look
and
smile
for
you
are
really
a
manly
young
fellow
i
expect
to
be
very
proud
of
you
one
of
these
and
i
am
that
already
said
herbert
for
the
captain
tells
me
you
are
a
fine
scholar
for
a
lad
of
your
years
besides
i
know
you
are
a
good
and
dutiful
son
to
indeed
he
is
that
as
all
my
boys
are
the
mother
said
regarding
the
three
with
loving
looks
and
can
you
not
say
as
much
for
your
daughters
too
least
for
elsie
and
vi
asked
rosie
in
playful
tone
but
with
a
wistful
look
i
can
indeed
for
them
and
for
rosie
also
the
mother
answered
smiling
affectionately
upon
her
my
daughters
are
all
great
blessings
for
which
i
thank
my
heavenly
father
every
day
of
my
life
but
now
let
us
have
our
morning
chapter
together
opening
her
bible
as
she
spoke
the
morning
was
bright
and
fair
and
it
was
a
cheerful
party
that
presently
surrounded
the
saturday
morning
so
only
two
hours
for
lessons
remarked
walter
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
breaking
a
slight
pause
in
the
conversation
what
my
scholarly
little
grandson
rejoicing
in
release
from
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
exclaimed
dinsmore
in
mock
surprise
and
disapproval
ah
grandpa
you
are
just
in
sport
i
know
laughed
walter
but
don
t
you
believe
these
older
fellows
croly
and
my
two
brothers
are
glad
of
their
holiday
i
just
know
they
judging
others
by
yourself
after
the
manner
of
older
people
eh
yes
sir
and
i
d
like
to
know
what
s
going
to
be
done
well
i
believe
i
can
inform
you
everybody
who
wants
to
go
and
has
been
faithful
in
attendance
to
preliminary
duties
will
spend
the
day
by
invitation
at
the
oaks
rosie
s
day
and
yours
beginning
when
your
two
hours
of
school
duties
are
oh
i
like
that
i
m
glad
cousin
mary
that
you
are
to
see
the
place
it
is
so
lovely
there
and
was
mamma
s
home
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
when
she
grew
to
be
a
young
lady
and
there
are
the
rooms
that
used
to
be
hers
and
the
one
she
was
married
i
shall
be
greatly
interested
in
looking
at
them
all
as
well
as
glad
to
visit
cousin
horace
and
his
family
returned
miss
keith
i
believe
we
are
all
invited
edward
remarked
interrogatively
turning
to
his
wife
yes
my
dear
zoe
replied
even
to
the
babies
who
i
hope
will
have
a
good
time
together
in
the
nursery
or
out
in
the
yes
said
rosie
sisters
elsie
and
violet
were
talking
of
going
with
all
the
children
and
young
folks
of
each
family
aunt
rosie
too
expects
to
be
there
with
her
husband
and
all
the
children
the
howards
are
going
also
the
conlys
too
so
that
we
shall
be
the
same
large
party
that
were
here
and
next
week
said
zoe
we
are
all
to
assemble
at
woodburn
one
day
at
the
laurels
on
another
then
at
fairview
and
afterward
at
what
a
grand
time
we
shall
have
continued
rosie
and
how
can
anybody
be
expected
to
give
his
or
her
mind
to
lessons
i
have
serious
thoughts
of
petitioning
my
big
a
week
of
how
would
it
do
to
beg
off
from
attendance
upon
the
parties
in
order
to
do
justice
to
your
studies
asked
her
grandfather
in
the
tone
of
one
suggesting
an
agreeable
alternative
o
grandpa
i
couldn
t
think
of
being
so
very
impolite
she
exclaimed
surely
you
must
know
that
my
absence
would
spoil
all
the
fun
and
seriously
interfere
with
any
enjoyment
others
might
find
in
being
there
if
i
were
with
them
but
then
we
ought
any
of
us
to
be
willing
to
forego
our
own
enjoyment
for
the
sake
of
your
improvement
in
your
beloved
studies
rosie
dear
said
herbert
in
tones
of
brotherly
affection
ah
but
i
could
not
think
of
allowing
such
for
my
sake
she
exclaimed
i
should
even
prefer
rising
an
hour
earlier
in
the
morning
or
toiling
over
my
tasks
an
hour
later
at
night
and
that
is
what
i
think
i
shall
do
if
the
captain
proves
obdurate
in
regard
to
the
granting
of
the
which
he
will
if
i
m
not
greatly
mistaken
said
walter
he
said
we
were
to
go
on
with
our
studies
till
the
time
for
our
usual
summer
trip
up
north
and
he
s
a
man
to
stick
to
his
word
if
there
ever
was
quite
a
strong
recommendation
walter
laughed
dinsmore
and
i
really
think
the
captain
is
deserving
of
the
captain
is
a
very
agreeable
man
to
have
a
chat
with
remarked
croly
i
have
seldom
been
more
interested
than
i
was
yesterday
in
a
little
talk
i
had
with
him
in
regard
to
mining
interests
in
the
far
yes
he
owns
property
out
there
in
which
there
are
mines
of
great
value
said
harold
ah
i
was
not
aware
of
that
fact
and
he
did
not
mention
it
returned
croly
but
in
reply
to
a
remark
of
mine
that
i
had
been
paying
some
attention
to
mineralogy
and
thought
of
going
out
to
examine
some
land
father
owns
in
arizona
he
gave
me
a
good
deal
of
interesting
information
such
as
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
in
any
publication
on
the
subject
that
i
have
got
hold
of
as
and
should
you
question
him
on
naval
matters
or
the
history
of
our
indeed
history
of
any
part
of
the
world
i
believe
he
could
furnish
all
the
information
you
might
happen
to
want
said
herbert
yes
said
walter
it
s
my
decided
belief
that
brother
levis
knows
about
as
much
on
almost
every
subject
as
you
could
find
in
any
of
the
that
s
very
strong
walter
laughed
edward
the
captain
is
without
doubt
a
highly
educated
intelligent
and
man
yet
hardly
a
walking
cyclopædia
a
compliment
at
which
no
one
would
laugh
more
heartily
than
himself
for
he
hasn
t
a
particle
of
in
his
now
you
are
complimenting
him
very
highly
ned
said
dinsmore
yet
are
not
saying
more
than
he
deserves
i
know
of
no
man
for
whom
i
have
a
higher
esteem
than
captain
and
i
can
echo
my
father
s
sentiments
he
is
a
noble
christian
man
the
best
of
husbands
and
fathers
said
travilla
i
know
of
no
man
with
whom
i
could
feel
better
satisfied
as
the
husband
of
one
of
my
daughters
evidently
he
makes
violet
very
and
his
children
from
the
oldest
to
the
youngest
fairly
idolize
him
remarked
zoe
and
you
do
not
object
to
him
as
a
said
rosie
interrogatively
on
the
contrary
i
like
him
extremely
in
that
capacity
was
the
quick
emphatic
rejoinder
mamma
said
rosie
insinuatingly
captain
raymond
thinks
a
great
deal
of
you
and
as
you
are
his
mother
he
ought
to
do
as
you
say
most
assuredly
in
regard
to
his
treatment
of
your
own
children
won
t
you
please
send
him
word
this
morning
that
we
ought
to
be
allowed
a
holiday
next
week
do
now
there
s
a
good
kind
would
you
have
me
say
what
i
do
not
think
rosie
dear
queried
her
mother
in
return
and
with
an
amused
look
into
the
bright
eyes
of
her
youngest
daughter
ah
mamma
how
can
you
be
so
severe
exclaimed
rosie
just
think
how
trying
to
walter
and
me
to
have
to
set
off
for
lessons
at
woodburn
not
only
but
every
day
next
week
when
you
have
only
been
with
us
for
a
day
now
since
your
return
from
your
trip
to
the
for
that
very
reason
you
and
i
ought
to
go
willingly
and
without
any
fuss
interposed
walter
with
manly
decision
of
air
and
tone
besides
as
i
said
before
i
know
it
would
be
perfectly
useless
to
try
to
get
brother
levis
to
change
his
mind
about
the
then
my
wise
younger
brother
i
ll
not
petition
for
your
release
from
s
tasks
or
those
of
next
week
said
rosie
oh
has
anything
been
seen
of
last
night
s
burglar
asked
croly
breaking
the
slight
pause
following
upon
rosie
s
last
remark
i
have
heard
nothing
of
him
replied
edward
and
indeed
had
forgotten
his
existence
until
you
spoke
and
poor
polly
has
she
been
seen
inquired
mary
keith
the
answer
was
in
the
negative
no
one
had
seen
or
heard
of
her
ah
well
then
i
suppose
she
must
have
found
her
way
back
to
woodburn
said
mary
by
the
way
cousin
mary
how
would
you
like
to
drive
over
there
this
morning
asked
edward
they
will
hardly
expect
us
at
the
oaks
before
eleven
o
clock
and
woodburn
lies
but
little
out
of
our
way
in
but
returned
miss
keith
we
might
perhaps
hinder
cousin
vi
in
her
preparations
for
the
day
s
i
am
going
to
drive
you
over
and
call
for
vi
and
the
little
ones
on
the
way
said
grandma
elsie
i
think
we
shall
find
her
ready
to
go
on
with
us
after
we
have
had
a
little
call
just
for
you
to
see
the
place
then
the
captain
will
come
somewhat
later
with
his
children
and
and
how
is
cousin
ronald
to
get
there
mamma
asked
walter
probably
in
the
captain
s
carriage
or
on
one
of
his
horses
she
replied
the
dear
old
gentleman
can
go
when
and
how
he
likes
all
such
questions
were
not
settled
last
night
but
i
know
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
his
way
or
that
of
any
other
invited
guest
in
getting
there
comfortably
and
in
good
i
m
glad
of
that
mamma
returned
walter
i
m
very
fond
of
cousin
ronald
and
wouldn
t
have
him
stay
away
for
at
that
remark
several
furtive
smiling
glances
were
exchanged
by
the
brothers
and
sisters
about
the
table
he
is
a
very
pleasant
old
gentleman
said
dinsmore
and
i
haven
t
a
doubt
will
add
a
great
deal
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
yes
madam
said
croly
i
saw
comparatively
little
of
him
yesterday
but
quite
enough
to
make
me
desire
a
further
oh
by
the
way
will
shall
we
walk
ride
or
drive
over
to
the
oaks
asked
harold
i
am
ready
for
any
way
that
suits
you
sir
replied
croly
well
said
dinsmore
i
see
every
one
is
ready
to
leave
the
table
we
will
have
prayers
at
once
and
afterward
settle
all
such
questions
in
regard
to
the
doings
of
the
chapter
x
mamma
said
rosie
following
her
mother
out
to
the
veranda
when
prayers
were
over
if
you
approve
i
will
go
up
at
once
and
dress
for
the
day
getting
walter
to
do
the
same
it
won
t
take
us
long
then
i
d
like
to
drive
over
immediately
to
woodburn
and
coax
brother
levis
to
let
us
all
begin
lessons
at
once
that
we
may
get
through
and
off
to
the
oaks
sooner
than
we
would
very
well
my
child
i
will
order
the
carriage
for
i
think
it
would
be
the
better
plan
for
you
to
drive
over
as
the
roads
are
dusty
was
the
indulgent
reply
yes
said
walter
who
had
followed
and
was
now
close
behind
them
i
like
that
plan
for
walking
one
would
have
to
take
either
the
very
dusty
road
or
the
wet
grass
and
i
d
like
to
get
through
lessons
as
early
as
possible
too
so
i
m
off
to
dress
and
away
he
ran
rosie
following
just
then
the
telephone
bell
rang
and
rosie
hastening
to
the
instrument
found
that
captain
raymond
was
calling
from
woodburn
to
say
that
his
pupils
there
had
requested
permission
to
begin
school
duties
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
that
so
they
might
be
ready
the
sooner
to
drive
over
to
the
oaks
that
he
had
given
consent
and
would
grant
the
same
privilege
to
rosie
and
walter
if
such
was
their
desire
and
they
would
come
immediately
thank
you
sir
we
will
be
there
in
a
few
minutes
returned
rosie
then
ran
away
to
hurry
through
her
preparations
while
her
mother
took
her
place
at
the
telephone
to
send
a
message
to
violet
to
the
effect
that
she
and
their
cousin
mary
might
be
expected
at
woodburn
about
ten
o
clock
to
make
a
short
call
after
which
they
would
go
on
to
the
oaks
taking
her
and
her
little
ones
with
them
if
that
arrangement
suited
her
convenience
thank
you
mother
dear
came
back
in
violet
s
own
sweet
tones
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
both
you
and
cousin
mary
and
you
will
find
me
and
my
babies
ready
to
accept
your
kind
rosie
and
walter
made
haste
with
their
toilets
were
presently
in
the
carriage
and
reached
woodburn
just
in
season
to
take
part
in
the
opening
school
exercises
all
went
prosperously
that
morning
the
lessons
had
been
thoroughly
prepared
the
recitations
were
so
good
that
the
captain
felt
entitled
to
bestow
unstinted
praise
and
his
pupils
were
dismissed
from
the
in
gayest
spirits
how
very
quiet
the
house
seems
exclaimed
lulu
as
they
passed
into
the
hall
yes
said
her
father
cousin
ronald
your
mamma
and
the
little
ones
have
gone
on
to
the
oaks
and
now
we
will
follow
them
as
soon
as
you
are
all
ready
our
large
family
carriage
is
in
waiting
it
will
hold
us
all
they
had
only
to
put
on
their
hats
and
gather
up
a
few
little
things
they
wanted
to
take
with
them
and
they
drove
away
a
merry
laughing
jovial
little
party
so
full
of
fun
and
frolic
that
time
passed
very
quickly
and
all
were
surprised
when
they
found
the
carriage
turning
in
at
the
great
gates
opening
upon
the
beautiful
grounds
of
the
place
that
had
been
elsie
s
home
in
her
girlhood
s
days
the
chat
and
laughter
suddenly
ceased
and
all
eyes
turned
upon
the
lovely
scenes
through
which
they
were
passing
they
were
not
entirely
new
to
any
of
them
and
only
comparatively
so
to
marian
as
she
had
already
been
there
several
times
they
were
almost
the
last
to
arrive
of
all
the
large
company
of
invited
guests
and
as
they
neared
the
mansion
there
could
be
seen
here
and
there
on
the
lawn
and
in
the
shaded
alleys
groups
of
grown
people
and
of
children
some
sitting
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
others
sauntering
about
or
playing
merry
romping
games
while
filling
the
air
with
their
shouts
and
gleeful
laughter
a
cordial
welcome
was
given
the
captain
and
his
pupils
who
quickly
made
themselves
at
home
in
the
grounds
scattering
here
and
there
among
other
guests
according
to
inclination
or
convenience
the
captain
having
exchanged
greetings
with
his
host
hostess
and
other
friends
and
relatives
glanced
about
in
search
of
his
wife
you
are
looking
for
vi
captain
grandma
elsie
said
inquiringly
and
with
a
smile
she
is
engaged
in
piloting
cousin
mary
about
showing
her
the
places
made
memorable
by
having
been
the
scenes
of
notable
events
in
her
mother
s
life
when
this
was
her
own
and
her
father
s
home
i
believe
they
have
gone
down
to
what
is
still
called
elsie
s
ah
he
returned
and
my
companionship
would
hardly
be
welcome
just
at
present
i
i
can
not
say
sir
but
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
she
answered
and
thanking
her
he
at
once
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
arbor
which
was
of
course
no
unknown
spot
to
him
he
found
the
ladies
there
sitting
together
gazing
out
upon
the
lovely
verdant
valley
the
clear
waters
of
the
swiftly
flowing
river
and
the
woods
clad
in
the
deep
green
of
their
summer
robes
violet
was
speaking
in
low
feeling
tones
mary
listening
evidently
with
intense
interest
violet
had
been
telling
of
scenes
and
occurrences
described
in
elsie
s
girlhood
time
when
arthur
in
a
fury
of
passion
because
she
refused
to
advance
him
money
without
her
father
s
knowledge
and
consent
even
went
so
far
as
to
strike
her
and
was
immediately
soundly
thrashed
for
it
by
travilla
the
time
when
jackson
her
discarded
lover
discarded
at
first
in
obedience
to
her
father
s
command
afterward
loathed
by
her
when
she
had
learned
for
herself
that
he
was
a
villain
of
deepest
dye
instead
of
the
honorable
virtuous
man
she
had
formerly
esteemed
him
came
so
unexpectedly
upon
her
there
sitting
alone
and
undefended
and
with
a
loaded
pistol
threatened
her
life
unless
she
would
promise
never
to
marry
travilla
but
now
violet
s
theme
was
her
father
s
confession
of
his
love
and
her
mother
s
glad
sweet
story
told
to
her
by
that
mother
herself
since
the
dear
father
s
death
mamma
told
it
to
me
after
i
had
heard
the
same
sweet
story
from
the
lips
of
my
own
dear
husband
were
the
words
that
reached
the
captain
s
ear
as
he
stepped
into
the
arbor
and
as
she
turned
at
the
sound
their
eyes
met
with
a
look
of
love
as
ardent
and
intense
as
any
ever
bestowed
by
either
one
upon
the
other
they
were
as
truly
lovers
now
as
they
had
been
five
years
before
excuse
me
ladies
he
said
with
a
bow
and
smile
i
do
not
wish
to
intrude
and
will
go
away
at
once
if
my
company
is
not
it
is
no
intrusion
i
am
sure
was
the
reply
of
miss
keith
while
violet
said
with
a
look
of
pleasure
we
are
only
too
glad
to
have
you
with
us
my
dear
you
have
come
in
the
nick
of
time
for
i
have
just
finished
my
story
which
though
new
to
cousin
would
have
been
old
to
she
made
room
for
him
by
her
side
as
she
spoke
he
took
the
offered
seat
and
they
talked
for
a
little
of
the
lovely
grounds
and
the
beauty
of
the
view
from
that
point
then
rose
and
walked
back
to
the
house
conversing
as
they
went
violet
led
the
way
to
the
grassy
lawn
upon
which
opened
the
glass
doors
of
what
had
been
in
former
years
her
mother
s
and
through
them
into
the
room
itself
this
and
the
dressing
and
bed
rooms
beyond
were
mamma
s
apartments
while
living
here
she
said
and
loving
his
eldest
sister
as
he
does
uncle
horace
has
kept
them
furnished
all
these
years
almost
precisely
as
they
were
when
she
occupied
i
should
think
he
would
said
mary
keith
sending
keenly
interested
and
admiring
glances
from
side
to
side
it
is
all
so
lovely
that
i
should
not
want
to
change
a
single
thing
even
if
i
did
not
care
to
keep
them
just
so
in
remembrance
of
her
as
i
certainly
horace
dinsmore
came
in
at
that
instant
ah
vi
he
said
so
you
are
showing
your
mother
s
old
rooms
to
cousin
mary
that
is
right
i
spent
many
a
happy
hour
here
with
that
dear
sister
when
i
was
but
a
little
fellow
for
as
i
presume
you
know
she
is
twelve
years
older
than
i
ah
how
well
i
remember
the
heartache
it
gave
me
when
i
was
told
of
her
approaching
marriage
and
that
she
would
then
leave
our
home
for
travilla
s
at
ion
i
could
scarce
forgive
him
for
robbing
me
of
my
sister
in
fact
i
refused
my
consent
but
to
my
surprise
and
chagrin
found
that
it
made
no
he
led
the
way
into
the
this
he
said
is
where
i
found
her
standing
in
her
beautiful
bridal
robes
as
the
hour
drew
near
when
she
was
to
be
given
to
travilla
oh
how
beautiful
she
was
i
can
see
her
lovely
blushing
smiling
face
the
shining
hair
adorned
with
and
the
slender
graceful
figure
half
concealed
by
the
folds
of
rich
white
satin
and
a
cloud
of
lace
i
remember
exclaiming
you
look
like
an
angel
only
without
the
wings
and
how
i
wanted
to
hug
her
but
had
been
forbidden
lest
i
should
spoil
or
disarrange
some
of
her
finery
and
what
a
heartache
i
had
at
the
thought
that
she
was
never
to
be
the
same
to
me
entirely
our
she
had
been
before
she
called
me
to
come
and
kiss
her
and
oh
what
a
strong
effort
it
cost
to
refrain
from
giving
the
forbidden
hug
but
she
promised
me
an
opportunity
to
give
it
before
she
went
and
the
promise
was
remembered
and
did
you
not
hug
papa
instead
uncle
horace
queried
violet
between
a
smile
and
a
tear
for
she
was
thinking
of
that
dear
parent
as
gone
from
among
them
never
to
return
yes
he
said
he
kindly
invited
me
to
use
him
as
a
substitute
for
my
sister
which
i
did
heartily
for
he
was
a
great
favorite
with
me
in
spite
of
his
robbing
me
of
in
which
room
of
the
house
was
cousin
elsie
married
asked
mary
come
and
i
will
show
you
pointing
out
the
precise
spot
where
she
stood
during
the
ceremony
replied
dinsmore
leading
the
way
the
others
willingly
following
he
redeemed
his
promise
gave
a
description
of
the
adornment
of
the
rooms
on
that
memorable
occasion
of
the
grounds
also
and
ended
with
the
bride
s
farewell
to
relatives
and
near
and
dear
friends
especially
her
almost
idolized
father
yes
said
violet
mamma
has
always
loved
grandpa
so
very
very
dearly
and
his
love
for
her
is
i
believe
quite
as
great
ah
uncle
let
us
take
cousin
to
the
hall
and
show
her
the
niche
from
which
mamma
once
fell
when
quite
a
little
and
i
a
baby
boy
he
returned
with
a
smile
as
he
led
the
way
but
it
was
not
from
a
niche
she
fell
vi
but
from
a
chair
on
the
edge
of
which
she
stood
trying
to
reach
up
to
hide
a
toy
mouse
behind
the
statue
there
the
chair
slipped
from
under
her
to
save
herself
from
falling
she
caught
wildly
at
the
legs
of
the
statue
and
she
and
it
came
down
together
with
a
crash
upon
the
marble
floor
there
is
the
niche
pointing
it
out
for
they
had
reached
the
hall
while
he
spoke
the
figure
occupying
it
now
is
one
purchased
to
replace
that
broken
by
its
fall
with
sister
at
that
did
it
fall
on
her
and
was
she
badly
hurt
asked
miss
keith
shuddering
slightly
as
she
spoke
no
replied
dinsmore
not
quite
upon
her
but
so
nearly
that
she
had
a
very
narrow
escape
from
being
crushed
by
it
she
was
stunned
and
bruised
but
that
was
all
and
she
was
able
to
join
in
the
sports
of
the
next
a
mary
that
was
in
the
winter
which
your
aunts
mildred
and
annis
spent
here
remarked
violet
i
suppose
you
have
heard
something
of
that
yes
i
think
i
have
said
miss
keith
cousin
percy
and
you
cousin
horace
were
babes
at
that
time
were
you
not
i
think
you
said
a
moment
i
have
been
told
that
we
were
dinsmore
replied
with
a
smile
now
i
think
i
have
shown
you
about
all
the
places
in
the
house
that
are
interesting
from
being
connected
with
events
in
my
sister
s
life
most
of
our
friends
are
at
present
on
the
verandas
or
the
lawn
shall
we
go
out
and
join
them
a
prompt
assent
was
given
and
he
led
the
way
all
the
invited
guests
seemed
to
have
arrived
even
conly
who
had
been
somewhat
delayed
by
professional
duties
was
there
surrounded
by
the
young
people
who
were
all
fond
of
him
as
both
relative
and
physician
calhoun
the
dinsmore
girls
evelyn
leland
marian
mcalpine
lulu
raymond
harold
and
herbert
travilla
formed
another
group
but
calhoun
on
seeing
mary
keith
approaching
left
the
others
advanced
to
meet
her
and
after
exchanging
with
her
a
pleasant
invited
her
to
a
stroll
through
the
grounds
adding
i
presume
you
have
hardly
seen
every
part
of
them
yet
no
she
replied
as
they
sauntered
on
together
and
went
on
to
tell
to
what
parts
violet
had
taken
her
ah
he
said
i
am
glad
the
pleasure
of
showing
the
rest
was
left
for
me
it
is
a
fine
old
place
and
being
a
near
relative
of
the
owners
i
have
seen
much
of
yes
and
i
have
been
told
that
roselands
also
is
a
fine
old
place
she
returned
and
was
not
it
cousin
elsie
s
home
at
one
time
yes
for
several
years
before
her
father
bought
this
place
and
fitted
it
up
for
a
home
for
himself
and
i
think
it
was
there
she
was
so
very
ill
while
still
quite
a
little
girl
yes
that
was
before
my
time
but
when
you
visit
us
there
as
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
do
next
week
i
will
show
you
the
room
she
occupied
am
forgetting
that
the
house
standing
there
then
was
afterward
burned
down
but
it
was
rebuilt
that
part
of
it
being
an
exact
reproduction
of
those
rooms
in
the
old
burned
down
did
you
say
how
did
that
happen
it
was
during
the
war
he
replied
as
i
remember
roselands
on
my
first
sight
of
it
it
was
a
most
desolate
the
ruins
of
a
house
there
the
ground
ploughed
up
by
cannon
the
grand
old
trees
all
cut
down
the
lawn
changed
to
a
muddy
field
the
gardens
a
desert
neither
fences
hedgerows
nor
shrubbery
left
the
fields
overgrown
with
the
result
of
that
dreadful
civil
war
for
which
i
now
see
there
was
no
cause
but
the
curse
of
slavery
but
he
continued
his
voice
taking
on
a
more
cheerful
tone
many
years
have
passed
since
then
our
dear
cousin
elsie
furnished
the
necessary
means
for
repairing
damages
so
far
as
money
could
do
it
the
passing
years
have
helped
and
roselands
again
deserves
its
name
in
the
eyes
of
its
owners
at
least
it
is
again
a
beautiful
place
the
fields
are
fertile
and
scarce
anything
is
left
that
reminds
us
of
its
former
i
am
very
glad
indeed
to
hear
that
returned
mary
and
shall
greatly
enjoy
seeing
it
in
its
renewed
beauty
this
place
it
would
seem
escaped
better
than
roselands
far
better
indeed
had
i
believe
suffered
only
from
some
years
of
neglect
it
was
quite
habitable
so
uncle
kindly
gave
us
all
shelter
here
for
a
is
until
roselands
was
ready
to
receive
that
was
very
kind
responded
mary
it
was
indeed
said
calhoun
i
can
not
tell
you
how
strongly
i
am
attached
to
uncle
aunt
rose
cousin
elsie
and
indeed
the
whole
just
then
a
turn
in
the
walk
brought
them
face
to
face
with
another
small
party
of
young
dinsmore
girls
rosie
travilla
croly
harold
and
herbert
so
here
you
are
exclaimed
harold
we
were
looking
for
you
and
want
to
take
you
back
near
the
house
we
are
to
have
a
small
lunch
of
cake
and
lemonade
handed
about
to
us
on
the
lawn
aunt
sue
says
after
that
some
games
to
make
the
time
pass
pleasantly
until
the
with
such
inducements
held
out
would
it
not
be
well
to
go
with
them
miss
keith
queried
calhoun
perhaps
so
she
returned
laughingly
since
i
heard
the
lemonade
mentioned
i
have
discovered
that
i
am
somewhat
and
i
own
that
the
announcement
has
had
the
same
effect
upon
me
he
said
then
come
said
herbert
leading
the
way
by
turning
into
another
shaded
alley
we
will
reach
our
destination
sooner
by
this
the
day
passed
most
pleasantly
to
all
the
greater
part
of
it
spent
in
sports
in
the
open
air
a
grand
dinner
served
in
the
large
of
the
mansion
taking
up
an
hour
or
more
then
a
time
of
rest
and
quiet
talk
underneath
the
trees
or
on
the
verandas
after
that
more
games
followed
by
a
light
tea
handed
the
guests
where
they
were
and
soon
after
a
pleasant
ride
or
drive
homeward

the
next
day
was
sunday
always
religiously
kept
by
every
family
in
the
connection
they
all
met
at
church
in
the
morning
and
most
of
the
ion
and
woodburn
people
again
in
the
afternoon
first
at
the
on
the
captain
s
estate
where
an
hour
was
spent
in
the
instruction
of
the
poor
whites
of
the
neighborhood
then
in

appropriated
to
the
same
use
for
the
colored
race
of
the
vicinity
mary
keith
harold
herbert
and
their
old
friend
croly
attended
and
took
part
in
the
exercises
of
both
schools
for
they
were
all
earnest
active
christian
workers
full
of
zeal
for
the
master
s
cause
and
anxious
to
win
souls
for
him
harold
and
herbert
dearly
loved
to
talk
over
with
their
mother
their
plans
for
future
usefulness
and
the
necessary
preparation
for
it
and
to
their
supreme
content
contrived
to
get
her
to
themselves
for
a
time
on
their
return
from
the
scene
of
that
afternoon
s
labors
the
call
to
tea
broke
up
their
conference
the
evening
was
spent
in
bible
study
religious
conversation
and
sacred
song
it
had
been
a
day
of
rest
from
earthly
cares
and
pleasures
and
all
rose
on
monday
morning
refreshed
and
strengthened
in
mind
and
body
that
day
was
spent
at
the
laurels
very
much
as
saturday
had
been
at
the
oaks
tuesday
at
fairview
violet
claimed
her
right
to
be
the
next
entertainer
of
the
connection
so
all
were
invited
to
spend
that
day
at
woodburn
where
preparations
for
their
entertainment
had
been
going
on
for
several
days
eager
impetuous
lulu
was
almost
wild
with
delight
o
papa
she
said
when
she
and
grace
had
exchanged
with
him
their
usual
affectionate
i
do
just
hope
we
ll
give
the
folks
the
grandest
good
time
they
ve
had
anywhere
yet
it
s
a
splendid
day
and
our
grounds
never
looked
more
beautiful
i
could
hardly
get
dressed
for
gazing
at
them
through
my
bedroom
windows
and
i
thanked
the
lord
over
and
over
again
for
giving
me
such
a
lovely
home
and
dear
kind
father
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
giving
him
a
second
ardent
kiss
yes
daughter
he
returned
holding
her
close
the
goodness
of
our
heavenly
father
to
us
is
far
far
beyond
our
deserts
i
thank
him
every
day
for
the
ability
he
has
given
me
to
make
such
a
delightful
home
for
my
wife
and
yes
papa
said
grace
leaning
up
affectionately
against
him
on
his
other
side
and
slipping
a
hand
into
his
i
often
think
how
very
very
good
god
has
been
to
us
children
in
giving
us
such
a
good
kind
father
when
so
many
poor
children
have
cross
drunken
fathers
who
beat
and
abuse
them
for
just
nothing
at
all
and
don
t
care
whether
they
are
comfortably
fed
and
clothed
or
it
is
a
sad
truth
that
there
are
such
fathers
in
the
world
he
replied
and
some
who
with
all
their
efforts
can
not
comfortably
feed
and
clothe
their
little
and
other
poor
little
ones
who
have
no
father
or
mother
added
grace
oh
i
do
hope
god
will
let
me
keep
my
dear
father
as
long
as
i
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
anxious
and
troubled
about
that
daughter
the
captain
responded
tenderly
our
heavenly
father
knows
and
will
do
for
each
one
of
us
just
what
is
papa
said
lulu
coaxingly
don
t
you
think
you
could
excuse
us
from
lessons
there
will
be
so
much
going
on
that
i
know
i
shall
find
it
very
difficult
to
give
my
mind
to
lessons
and
i
m
sure
it
will
be
just
the
same
with
the
if
i
thought
it
for
your
good
daughter
he
said
in
reply
i
should
certainly
say
yes
but
i
do
not
if
you
are
diligent
you
can
be
ready
to
receive
your
young
guests
by
eleven
o
but
i
think
it
will
be
almost
impossible
to
give
my
mind
to
tasks
when
it
is
so
full
of
all
that
s
to
be
done
and
enjoyed
through
the
day
she
sighed
i
am
sure
you
can
if
you
will
exercise
sufficient
determination
he
replied
you
have
a
strong
will
and
can
put
it
to
good
use
in
forcing
lucilla
raymond
to
resolutely
put
aside
distracting
thoughts
and
give
her
mind
for
a
time
wholly
to
her
appointed
tasks
show
her
that
if
she
wants
to
do
right
and
please
her
heavenly
father
she
will
do
it
for
that
reason
and
if
she
loves
her
earthly
one
as
dearly
as
she
says
she
will
do
it
to
gain
his
approbation
and
make
his
heart
glad
that
he
has
so
good
and
dutiful
an
eldest
so
i
will
papa
she
said
giving
him
another
affectionate
hug
for
oh
i
do
want
to
make
you
glad
that
i
am
your
very
own
child
your
very
very
own
and
don
t
belong
to
anybody
else
in
the
whole
and
that
i
am
papa
grace
said
lifting
to
his
eyes
full
of
ardent
filial
love
i
am
every
bit
as
glad
to
belong
to
you
as
lu
and
i
quite
as
glad
to
own
you
my
own
darling
little
girl
he
responded
drawing
them
both
closer
into
his
embrace
the
rang
and
taking
a
hand
of
each
he
led
them
down
to
the
lower
hall
where
they
met
violet
coming
in
from
the
veranda
where
she
and
her
two
little
ones
had
been
taking
the
air
pleasant
greetings
were
exchanged
with
them
and
with
lilburn
and
marian
who
presently
joined
the
family
in
the
then
all
seated
themselves
the
blessing
was
asked
and
the
meal
began
cousin
ronald
said
violet
i
hope
you
will
help
to
entertain
our
guests
by
the
exercise
of
your
ventriloquial
powers
which
have
not
yet
been
discovered
by
either
cousin
mary
keith
or
i
should
like
to
oblige
you
cousin
replied
the
old
gentleman
but
i
fear
i
can
not
think
of
anything
new
in
that
well
she
said
we
will
hope
some
bright
thoughts
may
occur
to
perhaps
you
might
borrow
a
bugle
again
sir
remarked
lulu
with
a
little
laugh
i
don
t
believe
they
ve
found
out
yet
who
that
bugler
was
who
played
near
the
lakelet
at
ion
when
they
were
in
the
boat
on
no
said
marian
from
something
that
was
said
yesterday
i
am
sure
they
have
such
being
the
case
perhaps
the
fellow
may
take
it
into
his
head
to
visit
the
wood
here
this
afternoon
or
evening
lilburn
remarked
in
a
quiet
tone
oh
i
hope
he
will
exclaimed
lulu
and
that
he
ll
play
longer
than
he
did
at
ion
i
wonder
if
he
couldn
t
sing
us
a
song
too
she
added
smiling
archly
into
lilburn
s
eyes
now
perhaps
he
may
if
i
tell
him
that
a
daughter
of
our
entertainers
makes
the
request
returned
lilburn
gravely
i
ll
try
my
influence
with
him
my
oh
thank
you
sir
she
exclaimed
with
a
merry
laugh
i
am
quite
sure
he
will
not
be
able
to
resist
i
just
wish
we
had
maxie
here
said
grace
for
then
we
might
have
one
sing
and
the
other
play
at
the
same
that
would
be
fine
laughed
her
father
but
unfortunately
we
can
not
have
oh
exclaimed
marian
with
a
look
of
surprise
and
pleasure
now
i
know
who
was
the
ventriloquist
at
minersville
there
now
cried
grace
with
a
look
of
dismay
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
i
never
meant
to
tell
that
don
t
look
so
troubled
daughter
said
the
captain
smiling
kindly
upon
her
there
is
no
great
harm
done
marian
would
probably
have
found
it
out
before
long
without
any
help
from
and
i
ll
try
to
make
no
bad
use
of
my
discovery
added
marian
you
and
papa
are
very
kind
returned
grace
with
a
slight
sigh
of
relief
i
suppose
this
is
to
be
a
holiday
for
the
children
captain
remarked
violet
with
an
inquiring
look
at
her
husband
quite
a
mistake
my
dear
he
returned
pleasantly
i
do
not
think
it
good
for
my
pupils
to
have
too
many
holidays
and
have
no
doubt
they
will
enjoy
play
all
the
more
for
having
done
a
little
work
yes
sir
no
doubt
we
shall
said
marian
cheerfully
and
i
for
one
should
be
very
loath
to
miss
the
lessons
i
enjoy
them
and
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
taking
the
trouble
to
teach
you
are
as
welcome
as
possible
he
returned
in
the
kindest
of
tones
your
companionship
in
her
studies
is
of
advantage
to
my
daughter
lulu
and
makes
very
little
more
work
for
you
are
very
kind
indeed
to
look
at
it
in
that
light
sir
was
marian
s
response
while
lulu
gave
him
a
most
grateful
loving
look
then
a
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
doorway
into
the
hall
said
you
are
the
very
best
of
fathers
sir
always
ready
to
take
any
amount

exclaimed
baby

in
the
direction
of

but
no

dis

she
ran
on
down
the
hall
out
upon
the
veranda
looking
searchingly
from
side
to
side
back
again
and
through
the
different
rooms
calling
max
max
where

she

that

the
captain
pleasantly
it
was
cousin

spoke
making
his
voice
sound
like
max
oh
i
wish
it
was
maxie
cause

love

returned
the
baby
girl
tears
springing
to
her
eyes
never
mind
papa
s
dear
little
girl
the
captain
said
lifting
her
into
her
chair
again
we
may
hope
to
see
dear
brother
max

one
of
these
days
and
then
how
glad
we
shall
all

oh
yes
papa
please

a
letter
and
tell
him
elsie

him
to
come
soon
she
said
smiling
through
her
tears
the
moment
family
worship
was
over
marian
lulu
and
grace
hastened
to
the
where
they
were
joined
a
few
minutes
later
by
evelyn
leland
rosie
and
walter
travilla
the
lessons
had
all
been
thoroughly
prepared
so
that
recitations
proceeded
rapidly
and
by
eleven
o
clock
all
were
dismissed
with
permission
to
spend
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
such
sports
as
suited
their
inclination
the
guests
had
already
begun
to
arrive
and
directly
the
most
of
them
were
scattered
through
the
beautiful
grounds
exploring
every
nook
and
corner
of
them
then
games
were
tennis
croquet
and
others
suited
to
different
ages
and
tastes
a
grand
dinner
followed
in
due
season
after
which
they
sat
on
the
verandas
or
under
the
trees
or
wandered
slowly
through
the
wood
and
the
shaded
alleys
tea
was
over
the
sun
near
his
setting
and
somewhat
weary
with
their
sports
almost
all
were
seated
in
or
near
the
verandas
when
the
sound
of
a
bugle
broke
the
stillness
coming
apparently
from
the
wood
where
a
number
of
the
young
people
had
been
straying
only
a
before
there
he
is
again
cried
croly
starting
to
his
feet
harold
suppose
we
hurry
out
yonder
and
see
if
we
can
catch
sight
of
the
oh
not
yet
said
grandma
elsie
let
us
enjoy
his
music
for
a
little
first
hark
he
is
beginning
the
very
well
done
commented
dinsmore
as
the
last
notes
died
away
on
the
air
croly
looked
at
harold
and
half
rose
from
his
chair
but
the
bugler
began
again
this
time
it
was
a
scottish
air
and
marian
absently
and
scarcely
above
her
breath
sang
the
words
scots
wha
hae
wi
wallace
bled
scots
whom
bruce
hath
often
led
welcome
to
your
gory
bed
or
to
the
notes
of
the
bugle
died
away
and
all
was
quiet
for
a
moment
then
walter
broke
the
silence
so
that
s
a
scotch
tune
is
it
marian
i
heard
you
singing
scotch
words
to
wallace
and
there
s
scarcely
any
story
i
feel
more
interest
maybe
tales
of
our
own
revolution
they
were
brave
fellows
and
i
like
to
think
i
come
of
the
same
stock
on
mamma
s
side
at
yes
it
s
a
good
stock
to
come
of
she
answered
her
eyes
kindling
none
better
in
my
esteem
they
have
always
been
a
great
mass
o
them
at
least
but
hark
there
s
the
bugler
at
it
again
nearer
and
playing
quite
another
it
was
a
simple
little
air
played
as
a
prelude
and
presently
the
bugle
ceased
and
a
man
s
voice
sang
thimble
scolding
wife
lay
dead
says
thimble
my
dearest
dear
as
defunctum
said
death
has
cabbaged
her
oh
she
s
fled
with
your
gammon
and
spinnage
says
thimble
thimble
buried
his
wife
last
night
says
thimble
it
grieves
me
to
bury
my
heart
s
delight
with
a
diamond
ring
on
her
finger
so
tight
with
your
gammon
and
spinnage
says
thimble
to
cut
off
her
finger
and
get
this
ring
next
came
the
sexton
she
rose
on
an
end
and
she
gave
him
a
fling
you
dirty
dog
you
ll
do
no
such
a
thing
with
your
gammon
and
spinnage
off
ran
the
sexton
she
stalked
to
her
home
and
she
made
a
great
din
says
thimble
he
poked
out
his
head
and
he
said
with
a
grin
you
re
dead
my
dear
duck
and
i
can
t
let
you
in
with
your
gammon
and
spinnage
says
all
had
listened
intently
and
for
a
moment
after
the
song
ceased
no
one
moved
or
spoke
then
croly
started
up
saying
i
m
bound
to
see
that
fellow
come
harold
and
herbert
will
you
go
with
me
or
must
i
search
for
him
alone
oh
i
have
no
objection
to
going
with
you
returned
harold
with
a
slight
laugh
i
hardly
think
he
can
be
dangerous
and
if
he
is
i
must
try
to
defend
you
and
in
that
case
you
may
stand
in
need
of
my
services
also
said
herbert
joining
them
as
they
hurried
down
the
veranda
steps
and
along
the
drive
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sounds
of
the
bugle
and
the
voice
had
come
i
hope
they
won
t
find
him
a
dangerous
fellow
remarked
rosie
with
a
gleeful
laugh
no
indeed
i
hope
not
said
mary
keith
in
a
slightly
anxious
tone
have
you
gentlemen
any
idea
who
he
may
be
the
bugler
do
you
mean
cousin
asked
edward
travilla
i
won
t
say
certainly
but
i
have
an
idea
that
he
is
a
perfectly
harmless
old
fellow
who
occasionally
haunts
this
a
crazy
man
she
asked
no
not
that
but
one
who
enjoys
surprising
and
mystifying
those
who
know
little
or
nothing
about
him
or
his
well
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
he
is
harmless
she
said
in
a
tone
of
relief
for
knowing
that
one
can
enjoy
listening
to
his
playing
and
do
you
think
they
will
find
him
cousin
ronald
asked
marian
in
a
tone
that
sounded
slightly
mirthful
i
lassie
he
returned
what
should
i
ken
aboot
the
folks
o
this
neighborhood
oh
you
have
visited
here
a
good
deal
and
so
i
thought
you
might
have
gained
some
knowledge
of
so
odd
a
more
than
that
possessed
by
any
o
these
cousins
who
live
in
the
neighborhood
lass
he
asked
with
a
laugh
truly
you
are
paying
your
auld
kinsman
a
high
i
could
not
possibly
pay
you
one
that
would
be
higher
than
your
deserts
cousin
ronald
she
returned
oh
hark
exclaimed
rosie
the
bugler
is
at
it
again
as
a
few
notes
floated
on
the
air
then
the
same
voice
they
had
heard
before
sang
again
apparently
coming
from
a
not
many
yards
away
green
grow
the
rashes
o
green
grow
the
rashes
o
the
sweetest
hours
that
e
er
i
spend
are
spent
amang
the
lasses
he
seems
to
be
very
fond
of
the
lasses
but
has
nothing
to
say
of
the
lads
laughed
walter
and
they
it
seems
can
t
find
him
said
edward
as
the
three
young
men
were
seen
returning
toward
the
house
well
lads
what
success
he
called
to
them
none
as
yet
replied
harold
but
we
are
not
quite
in
despair
surely
we
heard
his
voice
a
moment
since
nearer
the
house
than
when
he
gave
us
his
thimble
yes
it
seemed
to
me
to
come
from
the
top
of
that
magnolia
and
he
must
be
very
quick
in
his
movements
if
he
has
got
down
from
it
what
you
doing
what
you
bout
came
just
at
that
instant
in
a
loud
harsh
scream
apparently
from
the
same
polly
wants
a
cracker
polly
wants
a
cup
of
the
three
young
men
stepped
close
to
the
tree
and
gazed
upward
among
its
branches
the
parrot
again
exclaimed
croly
do
you
see
her
boys
not
i
replied
herbert
but
it
is
quite
dark
up
there
where
the
branches
and
leaves
are
so
so
it
is
said
croly
hi
there
polly
show
go
way
screamed
the
harsh
voice
come
down
polly
we
won
t
hurt
you
said
harold
polly
s
hungry
polly
wants
a
cracker
responded
the
harsh
voice
come
down
and
if
you
are
the
good
bird
you
seem
you
shall
have
a
cracker
and
a
cup
of
coffee
he
promised
but
the
only
reply
was
a
sound
as
of
the
fluttering
and
flapping
of
wings
that
seemed
to
leave
the
tree
and
go
farther
away
till
lost
in
the
distance
gone
said
croly
and
i
did
not
catch
so
much
as
a
glimpse
of
her
did
anybody
else
and
you
haven
t
found
the
bugler
either
remarked
mary
keith
no
laughed
calhoun
conly
sitting
beside
her
they
are
not
very
successful
do
you
think
you
could
do
better
cal
asked
herbert
as
he
and
his
two
companions
came
leisurely
up
the
steps
into
the
veranda
well
i
hardly
think
i
should
do
worse
returned
calhoun
lightly
then
suppose
you
start
out
on
the
quest
find
that
bugler
and
coax
him
to
give
us
another
some
soft
low
notes
came
to
their
ears
at
that
moment
as
if
in
reply
they
seemed
to
issue
from
the
depths
of
the
wood
and
the
listeners
almost
held
their
breath
to
catch
them
as
they
died
away
croly
spoke
again
he
seems
to
have
made
quite
a
circuit
to
escape
us
and
why
on
earth
should
he
for
he
surely
has
no
reason
to
fear
we
would
do
him
bashful
perhaps
suggested
edward
but
why
care
to
see
him
is
not
hearing
enough
if
croly
were
a
woman
i
would
suggest
that
he
was
probably
actuated
by
curiosity
laughed
mary
keith
but
since
he
belongs
to
the
other
sex
it
must
be
supposed
to
be
something
dear
me
miss
keith
who
would
ever
have
dreamed
you
could
be
so
severe
you
who
belong
to
the
gentler
sex
returned
croly
in
a
feignedly
mortified
tone
hark
there
he
is
at
it
again
exclaimed
maud
dinsmore
as
distant
bugle
notes
once
more
came
softly
to
the
ear
if
you
want
to
catch
him
i
advise
you
to
hasten
in
the
direction
of
those
sounds
hardly
worth
while
since
he
is
so
adroit
at
getting
out
of
the
way
sighed
croly
sinking
into
a
chair
as
if
quite
exhausted
with
the
efforts
already
made
never
say
die
croly
laughed
rosie
travilla
gather
up
your
strength
and
pursue
the
investigation
try
try
try
again
is
an
excellent
yes
miss
rosie
in
some
cases
but
perhaps
not
in
this
where
the
game
seems
to
be
hardly
worth
the
oh
exclaimed
walter
the
music
seems
to
be
coming
nearer
hadn
t
you
fellows
better
start
out
and
try
again
to
catch
the
player
you
might
be
more
successful
this
time
i
wouldn
t
like
to
give
it
up
so
if
i
were
in
your
then
suppose
you
put
yourself
in
our
place
and
start
out
in
quest
of
him
suggested
his
brother
harold
i
ve
no
objections
i
m
not
afraid
of
him
returned
walter
jumping
up
but
if
you
d
like
to
go
with
me
cousin
ronald
turning
toward
the
old
gentleman
as
if
with
a
sudden
thought
i
d
be
very
glad
to
have
lilburn
rose
as
if
to
comply
with
the
request
but
travilla
interposed
oh
no
my
son
she
said
cousin
ronald
must
feel
tired
after
all
the
exertion
he
has
made
and
i
offer
myself
as
a
substitute
said
conly
rising
if
the
fellow
should
happen
to
be
vicious
enough
to
knock
you
down
walter
it
might
be
well
to
have
the
doctor
along
to
see
to
your
pshaw
i
m
not
a
bit
afraid
of
him
said
walter
but
your
lack
of
fear
is
no
positive
proof
that
he
is
entirely
harmless
so
i
think
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
have
an
elder
brother
along
remarked
herbert
following
them
down
the
veranda
steps
oh
come
along
then
and
if
the
fellow
attacks
us
i
ll
do
my
best
to
defend
you
laughed
walter
and
the
three
set
off
together
for
the
wood
is
this
the
bugler
s
first
visit
to
your
place
captain
asked
croly
i
really
do
not
remember
having
heard
his
bugle
about
here
before
was
the
reply
in
a
meditative
tone
but
i
do
not
imagine
him
a
person
likely
to
do
any
why
there
is
the
hack
from
union
turning
in
at
the
great
gates
exclaimed
lulu
we
must
be
going
to
have
a
it
came
rapidly
up
the
drive
and
paused
before
the
entrance
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
rather
man
alighted
the
captain
at
the
same
time
rising
from
his
chair
and
stepping
forward
to
greet
him
captain
raymond
the
stranger
said
inquiringly
lifting
his
hat
as
he
spoke
at
that
lilburn
sprang
to
his
feet
and
came
forward
exclaiming
what
hugh
my
mon
is
it
you
grasping
the
young
man
s
hand
and
giving
it
a
hearty
shake
it
s
one
o
my
sons
captain
turning
glad
shining
eyes
upon
his
host
i
was
not
expecting
him
for
he
had
given
me
no
warning
of
his
you
are
very
welcome
sir
said
the
captain
taking
the
hand
of
the
young
man
in
a
cordial
grasp
at
that
grandma
elsie
and
dinsmore
and
violet
hastened
forward
with
like
greetings
and
expressions
of
pleasure
at
seeing
him
again
after
the
lapse
of
years
since
their
weeks
of
friendly
intercourse
at
the
but
you
should
be
my
guest
cousin
said
travilla
we
shall
be
going
home
presently
and
will
be
most
happy
to
have
you
accompany
oh
no
mother
it
will
not
do
for
you
to
rob
us
of
our
guest
so
promptly
said
captain
raymond
no
indeed
mother
dear
we
must
have
cousin
hugh
here
with
his
father
at
least
for
the
first
few
days
violet
hastened
to
say
and
so
it
was
settled
after
a
little
more
discussion
and
a
servant
was
dispatched
to
the
village
for
hugh
s
baggage
just
as
that
matter
was
fairly
arranged
conly
herbert
and
walter
returned
to
the
house
when
they
and
hugh
had
been
introduced
and
had
exchanged
greetings
croly
inquired
if
they
had
succeeded
in
catching
the
bugler
no
we
didn
t
get
so
much
as
a
glimpse
of
him
returned
walter
but
then
you
see
it
was
growing
quite
dark
in
the
wood
so
that
it
wasn
t
so
very
difficult
for
a
fellow
to
make
his
chapter
xii
the
conlys
claimed
it
as
their
privilege
to
entertain
the
connection
on
the
following
day
and
before
leaving
woodburn
that
evening
gave
hugh
lilburn
a
cordial
invitation
to
make
one
of
the
company
which
he
accepted
with
evident
pleasure
again
the
weather
was
delightful
every
one
in
good
health
and
spirits
and
the
host
and
hostess
were
most
kind
and
attentive
making
each
guest
feel
welcome
and
at
home
roselands
was
again
a
beautiful
place
its
fields
in
a
higher
state
of
cultivation
than
ever
before
yielding
excellent
crops
calhoun
having
proved
himself
a
wise
industrious
scientific
planter
and
manager
while
arthur
assisted
with
his
advice
and
professional
gains
so
that
they
had
at
length
succeeded
in
paying
off
all
indebtedness
and
could
feel
that
the
estate
was
now
really
their
own
calhoun
greatly
enjoyed
showing
mary
keith
about
the
house
and
grounds
calling
her
attention
particularly
to
such
parts
of
them
as
were
more
especially
associated
with
the
experiences
of
his
cousin
elsie
s
early
life
for
mary
was
a
deeply
interested
listener
to
everything
he
had
to
tell
on
the
subject
toward
all
had
gathered
on
the
verandas
and
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
the
young
people
and
little
ones
were
somewhat
weary
with
romping
games
and
roaming
over
the
grounds
so
that
very
little
was
going
on
among
them
except
a
bit
of
quiet
chat
here
and
there
between
some
of
the
older
people
walter
always
eager
for
the
sports
cousin
ronald
could
make
for
them
with
his
ventriloquism
stepped
to
the
back
of
the
old
gentleman
s
chair
and
made
a
whispered
request
for
an
exertion
of
his
skill
in
that
line
wait
a
bit
laddie
and
i
ll
see
what
can
be
done
replied
lilburn
ever
willing
to
indulge
the
boy
who
was
a
great
favorite
with
him
walter
took
possession
of
a
vacant
chair
near
at
hand
and
patiently
waited
lilburn
gave
his
son
a
slight
sign
hardly
noticed
by
any
one
else
and
almost
immediately
the
notes
of
a
flute
came
softly
to
the
ear
as
if
from
some
distance
instantly
conversation
was
hushed
and
all
listened
intently
it
seemed
but
a
prelude
and
presently
a
rich
tenor
voice
struck
in
and
sang
a
pretty
scotch
ballad
the
flute
playing
an
accompaniment
many
looks
of
surprise
were
exchanged
for
surely
cousin
ronald
could
not
be
responsible
for
it
all
he
could
not
both
sing
and
play
the
flute
at
the
same
time
and
the
questions
who
are
they
what
does
it
mean
passed
from
one
to
another
what
you
doing
what
you
bout
screamed
a
harsh
voice
apparently
from
a
near
at
hand
none
o
your
business
croaked
another
walter
started
up
and
whispered
in
the
old
gentleman
s
ear
why
cousin
ronald
are
there
two
of
you
it
can
t
be
that
max
is
here
no
no
laddie
that
guess
is
wide
of
the
mark
laughed
lilburn
in
return
while
little
elsie
raymond
exclaimed
two
pollies
and
we
have
only
one
at
our
why
it
s
very
odd
remarked
lulu
i
really
thought
my
polly
was
the
only
one
in
this
i
think
the
voice
of
the
first
one
was
hers
said
mary
keith
and
the
same
too
that
we
heard
at
ion
i
recognized
it
when
i
saw
and
heard
her
at
woodburn
but
the
other
voice
is
a
little
yes
a
little
harsher
said
rosie
like
a
male
voice
polly
must
have
hunted
up
a
mate
two
cups
of
coffee
screamed
the
first
voice
polly
wants
her
not
breakfast
polly
but
supper
laughed
walter
you
don
t
seem
to
know
the
time
o
supper
polly
wants
her
supper
croaked
the
second
voice
polly
s
just
wait
a
bit
laughed
walter
we
ll
all
be
getting
ours
presently
and
if
you
are
good
birds
probably
you
ll
get
some
at
that
moment
a
bell
rang
there
s
the
call
to
it
now
said
calhoun
walk
in
ladies
and
the
pollies
shall
have
theirs
if
they
will
follow
with
the
every
one
accepted
the
invitation
and
they
were
soon
seated
about
the
tables
it
took
several
to
accommodate
them
all
a
moment
s
hush
then
cousin
ronald
was
requested
to
ask
a
blessing
and
did
so
in
a
few
words
spoken
in
reverent
tones
the
guests
were
then
helped
and
the
meal
began
a
buzz
of
subdued
conversation
accompanying
it
the
parrot
at
woodburn
had
learned
many
words
and
sentences
since
her
arrival
there
during
lilburn
s
visit
he
and
she
had
become
well
acquainted
and
under
his
tuition
her
vocabulary
had
been
very
considerably
increased
so
that
she
could
upon
occasion
or
when
so
disposed
make
herself
a
very
entertaining
companion
presently
her
voice
or
one
very
like
it
was
heard
above
the
clatter
of
plates
knives
and
forks
and
the
buzz
of
talk
coming
seemingly
from
the
mantelpiece
some
yards
in
lilburn
s
rear
polly

her
supper
what

unless

in

to

i
neddie
boy
said
his
uncle
edward
but
at
that
instant
subdued
voices
were
heard
conversing
in
quiet
tones
apparently
outside
upon
the
veranda
but
close
to
an
open
door
leading
into
the
that
supper
smells
mighty
good
so
it
does
pat
come
now
let
s
just
step
in
and
help
ourselves
seein
as
they
doan
t
hev
perliteness
enuff
to
ask

out
so
much
as
a
bite
o
victuals
to
let

wait

turn
though
and
perhaps
we

get
an
invite
when
they

well
filled
you

they

eat
it
all
theirselves
huh
no
how
could
they
there

and
loads
of
grub
there
plenty
for
them
and
us
yaas
bout
enuff
to
feed
a
conversation
about
the
table
had
ceased
every
one
was
gazing
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sounds
of
the
talk
between
the
two
rough
men
seemed
to
come
whar
dem
fellers
i
doan
see
em
exclaimed
a
colored
lad
engaged
in
waiting
on
the
table
hear
deir
talkin
plain
nuff
ha
ha
laughed
one
of
the
strange
voices
is
that
so
darky
then
i
reckon
your
hearing
s
some
better
n
your
impident
rascal
returned
the
colored
lad
wrathfully
mr
cal
i
ll
go
drive
im
out
ef
you
say
so
yes
do
so
at
once
hector
returned
calhoun
we
don
t
want
tramps
about
and
he
seems
a
decidedly
impudent
hector
hurried
to
the
door
but
was
back
again
in
a
moment
his
face
ghastly
with
fright
am
no
dar
sir
he
gasped
couldn
t
see
nobody

you
spose
dey
s
done
gone
so
pow
ful
quick
sah
oh
don
t
be
frightened
hector
they
re
not
likely
to
prove
very
dangerous
fellows
returned
calhoun
the
probability
would
seem
to
be
that
they
have
just
stepped
off
the
veranda
into
the
you
know
at
seeing
so
powerful
a
fellow
as
you
coming
after
them
in
such
a
will
be
back
asking
for
their
supper
in
another
minute
or
two
however
as
they
may
be
lurking
about
watching
an
opportunity
to
help
themselves
you
may
as
well
send
some
one
out
to
look
them
up
and
watch
their
ha
ha
you
re
a
bit
late
with
your
precautions
mister
exclaimed
one
of
the
voices
now
coming
apparently
from
an
inner
room
we
re
here
already
and
what
s
more
defy
you
sir
to
put
us
out
in
a
that
s
so
growled
the
other
voice
twould
take
any
two
o
those
gents
at
the
table
to
put
me
out
and
i
ll
not
go
a
step
till
i
ve
satisfied
my
appetite
with
the
best
they
ve
well
exclaimed
ella
if
that
isn
t
impudence
i
never
heard
any
but
we
are
neglecting
our
guests
art
uncle
horace

replenishing
the
captain
s
polly
s
hungry
poor
old
polly
poor
old
soul
screamed
from
the
mantelpiece
again
the
voice
that
sounded
like
that
of
lulu
s
pet
polly
wants
hush
polly
be
quiet
polly
croaked
the
other
voice
eat
your
cracker
and
go
to
hold
your
tongue
poll
screamed
the
first
polly
wants
a
cup
of
hector
who
was
a
new
servant
stood
looking
this
way
and
that
gasping
and
rolling
up
his
eyes
in
terror
but
the
others
who
were
tolerably
well
acquainted
by
hearsay
at
least
with
lilburn
s
ventriloquial
powers
had
by
this
time
recalled
what
they
had
heard
on
that
subject
and
went
quietly
about
waiting
upon
the
guests
croly
and
mary
keith
had
been
most
interested
listeners
and
when
an
instant
s
lull
occurred
after
the
screams
the
former
said
well
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
now
fully
convinced
that
we
have
at
least
one
ventriloquist
among
us
though
which
of
you
it
is
i
have
not
been
quite
able
to
it
may
perhaps
be
easier
to
decide
who
it
is
not
remarked
the
elder
dinsmore
with
an
amused
smile
very
true
sir
said
croly
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
not
yourself
captain
raymond
doctor
conly
or
my
friends
harold
or
herbert
with
the
last
words
he
looked
inquiringly
at
each
of
the
other
gentlemen
present
not
one
of
them
seemed
to
him
to
look
conscious
and
he
felt
that
his
question
still
remained
unsolved
hector
still
trembling
with
fright
and
now
and
then
sending
a
timorous
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
door
at
which
the
tramps
had
last
been
heard
had
listened
in
wondering
surprise
to
the
talk
about
the
ventriloquist
what
dat
scip
he
asked
in
shaking
undertones
plucking
at
the
sleeve
of
a
fellow
servant
dat
dis
chile
neber

sort
of

loftily
pears
like
maybe

him
in
de
parlor

behind

the
children

been
looking
and
listening

his
father
while

with

many
older
big
folks

the
little
one
smiling
up
into
his
father
s
face
so
they
do
and
so
may

big
returned
his
father
and
now
when

may
talk
well
hector
suppose

take

frightened
young
don

be
afraid
i
promise
to
cure
your
hurts
if
you
get
any
in
trying
to
put
them
but
hector
stood
where
he
was
as
if
rooted
to
the
spot
shaking
his
head
gloomily
in
response
to
the
doctor
s
suggestions
no

but

he
answered
retreating
a
little
farther
from
the
parlor
door
as
he
spoke
then
come
and
make
yourself
useful
said
ella
get
your
salver
and
hand
this
cup
of
coffee
to
hector
obeyed
and
cousin
ronald
giving
him
a
humorous
look
as
he
took
his
cup
from
the
salver
asked
are
you
really
going
to
leave
those
tramps
in
the
parlor
yonder
to
carry
off
whatever
they
please
why

dis

so
powerful

dat
he

grumbled
hector
looking
very
black
at
the
suggestion
oh
hector
don
t
be
such
a
coward
exclaimed
walter
travilla
i
m
not
very
big
or
strong
but
if
mamma
will
let
me
i
ll
go
along
and
protect
you
from
them
while
you
put

out
i
may
mayn
t
i
mamma
giving
her
an
inquiring
look
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
but
at
that
moment
one
of
the
strange
voices
was
again
heard
at
the
door
opening
on
the
veranda
never
mind
little
feller
we
re
out
here
and
going
off
now
and
we
haven
t
taken
a
pin
s
worth
for
we
re
honest
chaps
if
we
are
poor
and
sometimes
ask
for
a
bite
o
yaas
that
s
so
drawled
the
other
voice
a
sound
like
that
of
retreating
footsteps
followed
then
all
was
quiet
and
hector
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
glad
dey
s
gone
he
said
presently
then
went
briskly
about
his
business
it
was
still
early
not
yet
sundown
when
those
of
the
guests
who
had
little
ones
took
leave
of
their
kind
entertainers
and
started
for
their
homes
edward
and
zoe
with
their
twin
babies
were
among
the
first
herbert
too
excused
himself
and
on
the
plea
of
a
letter
to
write
for
the
next
mail
went
with
them
riding
his
horse
beside
the
carriage
in
which
the
others
were
seated
they
took
a
short
cut
through
a
bit
of
woods
and
were
moving
rather
leisurely
along
chatting
about
cousin
ronald
s
tricks
of
the
afternoon
and
speculating
upon
the
seeming
fact
that
he
must
have
a
coadjutor
when
herbert
suddenly
reined
in
his
steed
backing
him
away
from
the
vehicle
and
at
the
same
time
calling
out
in
a
quick
imperative
excited
tone
to
the
driver
rein
in
your
horses
solon
quick
quick
back
them
for
your
life
even
while
he
spoke
the
order
was
obeyed
yet
barely
in
time
for
at
that
instant
a
great
tree
came
down
with
a
heavy
crash
falling
across
the
road
directly
in
front
of
the
horses
and
so
close
that
it
grazed
their
noses
as
it
passed
zoe
throwing
an
arm
round
her
husband
s
neck
and
clasping
her
babies
close
with
the
other
gave
one
terrified
shriek
then
for
several
minutes
all
sat
in
silence
feeling
that
they
had
escaped
by
but
a
hair
from
sudden
horrible
death
edward
s
arm
was
about
her
waist
and
he
drew
her
closer
and
closer
yet
with
a
gesture
of
mute
tenderness
o
ned
dear
ned
how
near
we
ve
been
to
death
we
and
our
darlings
she
exclaimed
bursting
into
tears
and
sobs
yes
he
said
in
trembling
tones
oh
thank
the
lord
for
his
goodness
the
lord
first
and
then
you
herbert
for
his
brother
was
now
close
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
again
no
thanks
are
due
me
dear
ned
he
replied
with
emotion
but
let
us
thank
the
lord
that
he
put
it
into
my
heart
to
come
along
with
you
and
directed
my
eyes
to
the
tree
as
it
swayed
slightly
preparatory
to
its
sudden
fall
look
zoe
what
a
large
heavy
one
it
of
the
old
monarchs
of
the
wood
and
still
hale
and
vigorous
in
appearance
who
would
ever
have
expected
it
to
fall
so
suddenly
and
swiftly
i
hardly
want
to
she
said
shuddering
it
seems
so
like
a
dreadful
foe
that
had
tried
to
kill
my
husband
my
darling
babies
and
how
the
horses
are
trembling
with
fright
exclaimed
edward
poor
fellows
it
is
no
wonder
for
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
tree
actually
grazed
their
noses
as
it
yes
sah
it
did
dat
berry
ting
said
solon
who
had
alighted
and
was
stroking
and
patting
the
terrified
steeds
an
dey
mos
tinks
dey
s
half
killed
i
dunno
how
we
s
goin
fer
to
git
long
hyar
ed
ard
sah
cayn
t
drive
ober
dis
big
tree
no
how
no
but
perhaps
we
can
manage
to
go
round
it
or
better
still
we
ll
turn
and
drive
back
till
we
can
get
into
the
again
but
drive
slowly
till
your
horses
recover
in
a
measure
at
least
from
their
yes
i
think
that
is
the
best
we
can
do
said
herbert
wheeling
about
and
trotting
on
ahead
the
shock
to
zoe
had
been
very
severe
all
the
way
home
she
was
shuddering
trembling
sobbing
hysterically
and
clinging
to
her
husband
and
babies
as
though
in
terror
lest
they
should
be
suddenly
torn
from
her
arms
in
vain
edward
tried
to
sooth
and
quiet
her
clasping
her
close
and
calling
her
by
every
endearing
name
telling
her
the
danger
was
a
thing
of
the
past
that
their
heavenly
father
had
mercifully
preserved
and
shielded
them
and
they
had
every
reason
to
rest
with
quietness
and
assurance
in
his
protecting
care
yes
yes
i
know
it
all
dear
ned
she
sobbed
but
have
patience
with
me
dear
my
nerves
are
all
unstrung
and
i
can
not
be
calm
and
quiet
i
can
not
help
trembling
or
keep
back
the
tears
though
i
am
thankful
oh
so
thankful
that
not
one
of
us
was
killed
or
even
no
it
was
a
wonderful
escape
he
said
in
moved
tones
a
wonderful
evidence
of
the
goodness
of
god
to
all
of
us
and
thankful
i
am
that
even
the
horses
escaped
yes
yes
indeed
poor
things
i
m
very
glad
they
escaped
so
well
she
sobbed
but
for
them
to
have
been
killed
would
have
been
as
nothing
to
having
one
of
our
dear
babies
oh
no
no
and
we
can
never
be
thankful
enough
for
their
escape
he
responded
in
moved
tones
putting
his
arm
around
both
at
once
and
drawing
them
into
a
closer
embrace
while
they
looked
from
one
parent
to
the
other
in
wonder
there
dear
said
edward
the
next
minute
glancing
from
the
window
we
are
turning
into
our
own
avenue
and
you
may
surely
feel
that
the
threatened
danger
is
fully
ah
no
she
returned
shuddering
how
can
we
be
sure
that
any
of
our
grand
old
trees
may
not
fall
at
any
moment
i
shall
never
never
feel
safe
except
by
trusting
in
him
without
whose
will
not
even
a
sparrow
falls
to
the
ground
he
said
low
and
tenderly
the
angel
of
the
lord
encampeth
round
about
them
that
fear
him
and
delivereth
them
o
taste
and
see
that
the
lord
is
good
blessed
is
the
man
that
trusteth
in
and
you
are
that
man
and
so
the
lord
has
spared
you
and
your
wife
and
little
ones
o
ned
dear
ask
him
to
make
their
mother
a
christian
my
darling
i
will
i
do
every
day
of
my
life
he
said
with
emotion
and
holding
her
close
in
another
moment
the
carriage
had
drawn
up
before
the
veranda
steps
and
herbert
who
had
arrived
and
dismounted
a
little
in
advance
of
the
others
hastened
to
assist
them
to
alight
why
zoe
dear
girl
how
you
are
trembling
he
exclaimed
as
he
lifted
her
out
and
set
her
on
her
feet
don
t
allow
yourself
to
be
so
agitated
the
danger
is
past
and
by
god
s
great
goodness
we
have
all
escaped
yes
yes
i
know
it
she
said
but
the
shock
was
very
great
and
i
can
not
get
over
it
she
and
edward
went
directly
to
their
own
apartments
taking
their
babes
with
them
for
zoe
seemed
unwilling
to
lose
sight
for
a
moment
of
any
one
of
her
three
treasures
but
laurie
and
lily
were
soon
asleep
the
sweet
pets
murmured
zoe
leaning
over
them
her
eyes
full
of
tears
o
ned
suppose
they
or
even
one
of
them
had
been
struck
by
that
tree
and
killed
or
badly
hurt
how
could
we
have
borne
and
i
she
ended
with
a
storm
of
tears
and
sobs
only
by
the
strength
that
god
gives
in
proportion
to
our
needs
dear
little
wife
edward
answered
holding
her
close
and
caressing
her
with
great
tenderness
he
is
ever
faithful
to
his
promise
to
his
people
as
thy
days
so
shall
thy
strength
but
i
can
not
claim
that
promise
she
sobbed
laying
her
head
on
his
shoulder
while
he
clasped
her
close
but
i
want
to
be
a
christian
my
heart
goes
out
in
love
and
gratitude
to
him
for
sparing
to
me
my
life
my
dear
babies
and
most
of
all
my
best
and
dearest
of
and
i
should
be
very
very
desolate
without
you
and
yours
love
he
returned
with
emotion
i
can
not
feel
that
i
could
do
without
you
even
in
another
world
ah
dearest
why
delay
any
longer
why
not
come
this
give
yourself
to
god
surely
you
can
not
refuse
can
not
hesitate
when
you
think
of
all
his
to
you
and
i
do
want
to
be
his
she
said
but
the
way
does
not
seem
quite
clear
to
me
can
you
not
tell
me
just
how
it
is
very
simple
just
tell
him
that
you
are
a
lost
helpless
sinner
ask
him
to
forgive
your
sins
and
save
you
from
them
david
s
prayer
was
wash
me
thoroughly
from
mine
iniquity
and
cleanse
me
from
my
sin
create
in
me
a
clean
heart
o
god
and
renew
a
right
spirit
within
me
that
he
is
both
able
and
willing
to
grant
he
says
him
that
cometh
to
me
i
will
in
no
wise
cast
delay
is
very
dangerous
dearest
as
the
experience
of
this
evening
may
well
convince
us
we
are
sure
of
no
time
but
the
present
now
is
the
accepted
time
now
is
the
day
of
a
moment
of
silence
followed
broken
at
length
by
a
few
words
from
zoe
i
want
to
do
it
dear
ned
let
us
kneel
down
together
and
you
say
the
words
for
me
i
will
follow
you
in
my
heart
for
i
do
want
to
belong
to
the
dear
lord
jesus
from
this
time
they
knelt
down
with
their
arms
about
each
other
and
in
a
few
earnest
words
he
expressed
for
her
her
sense
of
sin
her
desire
to
be
delivered
from
it
and
to
consecrate
herself
with
all
her
powers
and
possessions
to
god
s
service
for
time
and
for
eternity
zoe
followed
with
a
fervent
amen
dear
lord
jesus
take
me
for
thy
very
own
and
let
me
be
thine
wholly
thine
forever
and
chapter
xiii

an
exciting
tale
to
tell
in
the

while

gave
his
horses
a
brief
rest
before
returning
to
roselands
for
the
remaining
members
of
the
family

was
listened
to
with
intense
interest
and
many
ejaculations
of
astonishment
at

of
our
adventure
in
the
woods
this
evening
asked
herbert
reining
in
his
steed
near
at
hand
it
was
quite
an
exciting
one
and
we
have
great
reason
for
gratitude
over
our
narrow
as
we
all
have
returned
his
mother
with
emotion
it
was
you
herbert
was
it
not
who
saw
the
tree
tottering
and
gave
warning
to
the
others
yes
mother
i
being
on
horseback
had
of
course
a
much
better
opportunity
to
see
it
than
the
others
in
the
covered
carriage
yet
it
was
a
good
providence
that
turned
my
eyes
in
that
direction
at
that
precise
moment
and
thus
saved
possibly
all
our
oh
we
can
never
be
thankful
enough
for
that
exclaimed
his
mother
but
zoe
was
very
much
frightened
solon
says
oh
very
much
and
no
wonder
poor
thing
but
edward
took
her
and
the
babies
directly
to
their
rooms
and
i
have
not
seen
them
since
i
wrote
my
letter
rode
in
to
union
and
mailed
it
and
have
just
ridden
out
the
carriage
had
been
at
a
standstill
while
they
talked
but
now
travilla
bade
solon
drive
on
they
were
very
near
home
and
in
another
minute
or
two
had
turned
in
at
the
avenue
gates
edward
was
waiting
on
the
veranda
to
assist
them
to
alight
and
his
mother
at
once
inquired
anxiously
about
zoe
and
the
twins
the
little
ones
are
asleep
and
zoe
is
resting
pretty
quietly
now
on
her
couch
edward
replied
i
suppose
herbert
and
solon
have
told
you
of
our
narrow
escape
from
being
crushed
by
a
falling
tree
as
we
passed
through
that
bit
of
woods
yes
it
was
a
wonderful
escape
elsie
returned
in
tones
quivering
with
emotion
i
can
never
be
thankful
enough
for
the
spared
lives
of
my
children
would
zoe
care
to
see
her
mother
just
now
do
you
think
yes
yes
indeed
mother
shall
i
take
you
to
her
now
our
guests
will
excuse
us
i
know
and
we
will
leave
the
others
to
entertain
zoe
lying
on
the
couch
in
her
the
crib
with
its
sleeping
little
occupants
within
reach
of
her
hand
started
up
with
a
glad
cry
o
mamma
dear
mamma
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
as
her
husband
and
his
mother
came
softly
in
and
drew
near
where
she
lay
elsie
took
her
in
her
arms
and
held
her
close
with
words
of
tenderness
and
love
my
dear
girl
my
dear
daughter
thank
god
that
i
have
you
safe
in
my
arms
again
how
little
i
thought
of
such
danger
when
we
parted
an
hour
ago
and
oh
to
have
lost
and
herbert
and
the
darling
babies
or
any
one
of
you
it
is
almost
too
terrible
to
think
of
for
a
yes
mamma
dear
even
the
sudden
danger
though
we
all
escaped
gave
me
a
shock
that
has
completely
unnerved
me
i
can
not
forget
for
a
moment
how
near
we
were
to
sudden
and
only
as
by
the
skin
of
our
she
shuddered
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
still
clinging
to
her
mother
and
held
fast
in
her
loving
embrace
then
in
a
low
sweet
voice
mamma
dearest
mamma
she
said
this
terrible
experience
this
narrow
escape
from
a
sudden
awful
death
has
proved
to
me
a
blessing
in
disguise
i
have
given
myself
to
god
and
feel
that
he
has
taken
me
for
his
very
own
child
and
oh
amid
all
my
suffering
from
shattered
nerves
there
is
a
sweet
peace
in
my
heart
such
as
i
have
never
known
before
my
dear
dear
child
elsie
exclaimed
with
emotion
no
sweeter
no
gladder
tidings
could
have
reached
me
it
is
an
answer
to
prayer
offered
for
years
that
edward
s
learn
to
know
and
love
the
lord
who
shed
his
own
precious
blood
that
we
might
have
eternal
yes
mamma
i
wonder
at
myself
that
i
could
have
ever
resisted
such
love
that
i
did
not
give
him
my
whole
heart
years
ago
and
strive
to
serve
him
with
all
my
yes
dear
little
wife
edward
said
with
emotion
what
seemed
to
us
so
terrible
at
the
time
has
turned
out
a
real
blessing
in
so
may
every
trial
prove
to
you
my
dear
children
said
his
mother
i
must
leave
you
now
and
zoe
dear
go
to
sleep
in
peace
fearing
no
evil
remember
and
rest
upon
those
sweet
words
the
lord
is
thy
keeper
the
lord
is
thy
shade
upon
thy
right
hand
the
sun
shall
not
smite
thee
by
day
nor
the
moon
by
night
the
lord
shall
preserve
thee
from
all
evil
he
shall
preserve
thy
edward
saw
his
mother
to
the
door
and
kissed
her
my
dear
boy
i
am
very
glad
for
you
she
said
glad
that
you
and
your
young
wife
the
mother
of
your
babes
are
at
last
travelling
the
same
road
and
may
hope
to
spend
a
blest
eternity
yes
mother
dear
i
think
i
have
great
reason
to
thank
god
for
that
narrow
escape
of
ours
from
a
sudden
terrible
death
he
replied
in
tones
tremulous
with
emotion
it
was
better
than
not
to
have
been
in
danger
since
it
has
proved
to
be
the
means
of
opening
zoe
s
eyes
to
her
guilt
and
danger
as
a
sinner
who
had
never
sought
pardon
and
safety
in
the
one
way
god
has
yes
my
heart
sings
for
joy
for
her
and
for
you
but
she
is
quite
worn
out
get
her
to
bed
and
to
sleep
as
soon
as
you
so
saying
elsie
hastened
downstairs
where
she
found
the
rest
of
her
family
and
her
guests
sitting
in
the
veranda
talking
over
the
events
of
the
day
particularly
the
narrow
escape
of
those
present
at
the
fall
of
the
tree
in
the
wood
both
harold
and
herbert
sprang
up
at
sight
of
their
mother
and
hastened
to
hand
her
to
a
comfortable
seat
how
is
zoe
elsie
asked
her
father
a
good
deal
shaken
and
exhausted
by
her
fright
papa
but
i
hope
a
night
s
sleep
will
restore
her
to
usual
health
and
spirits
o
herbert
my
dear
son
turning
to
him
how
thankful
i
am
for
your
escape
as
well
as
for
theirs
as
i
am
for
your
sake
mother
as
well
as
my
own
herbert
returned
taking
her
hand
and
carrying
it
to
his
lips
for
he
had
seated
himself
close
at
her
side
there
s
the
telephone
bell
exclaimed
rosie
springing
to
her
feet
and
running
into
the
hall
she
found
that
captain
raymond
was
calling
from
woodburn
to
ask
after
edward
zoe
and
the
others
who
had
been
present
at
the
fall
of
the
tree
he
was
glad
to
learn
that
they
had
escaped
injury
and
were
doing
well
his
inquiry
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
similar
one
from
fairview
then
from
each
of
the
other
places
with
which
ion
had
such
connection
and
all
expressed
themselves
relieved
to
learn
that
none
of
the
little
party
had
been
injured
at
woodburn
the
captain
and
his
two
gentlemen
guests
sat
conversing
together
this
is
a
beautiful
country
captain
remarked
hugh
father
and
i
are
so
well
pleased
with
it
and
with
the
relatives
we
have
found
here
that
we
have
serious
thoughts
of
settling
in
the
that
would
be
pleasant
for
us
said
the
captain
and
by
the
way
i
heard
that
our
next
neighbor
talks
of
selling
his
plantation
and
leaving
the
what
surely
not
that
beautiful
place
that
i
was
admiring
the
other
day
questioned
cousin
ronald
beechwood
i
think
you
told
me
they
called
the
very
same
replied
the
captain
and
we
should
all
be
very
glad
to
see
you
and
your
son
settled
what
do
you
say
to
that
laddie
asked
the
old
gentleman
turning
to
hugh
it
sounds
very
inviting
sir
was
the
smiling
reply
and
would
not
be
too
distant
from
our
proposed
place
of
no
i
think
not
hardly
more
than
fifteen
minutes
ride
or
drive
from
the
village
if
one
has
the
right
kind
of
ah
you
think
of
going
into
business
in
union
do
you
inquired
the
captain
in
a
tone
of
surprise
yes
i
have
been
quietly
spying
out
the
land
replied
cousin
ronald
and
if
hugh
agrees
with
me
in
thinking
it
a
suitable
place
for
a
factory
i
think
we
shall
buy
and
build
that
is
a
pleasant
prospect
for
us
said
captain
raymond
if
you
like
i
will
drive
you
both
over
there
and
also
take
you
to
look
at
the
offer
was
at
once
accepted
with
thanks
and
dismissing
his
pupils
a
little
earlier
than
usual
the
next
morning
the
captain
fulfilled
his
promise
to
his
guests
when
they
returned
the
news
they
brought
was
that
they
had
secured
a
suitable
site
for
a
factory
in
the
outskirts
of
union
and
were
carrying
on
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
beechwood
but
who
is
going
to
keep
house
for
you
cousin
ronald
asked
lulu
marian
i
hope
replied
the
old
gentleman
looking
smilingly
at
her
you
can
do
that
in
addition
to
attending
to
your
studies
can
you
not
my
bonny
lassie
i
can
try
she
said
with
a
look
of
delight
for
oh
but
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
a
home
with
my
dear
kind
old
and
so
near
to
us
marian
i
hope
you
are
as
glad
of
that
as
i
am
exclaimed
lulu
oh
yes
yes
indeed
cried
marian
i
hope
there
will
be
seldom
a
day
when
we
shall
not
see
each
other
for
you
are
like
a
sister
to
and
you
will
come
here
to
recite
every
school
day
i
hope
said
the
captain
for
i
do
not
want
to
lose
so
painstaking
industrious
and
promising
a
nor
i
so
good
and
kind
a
teacher
responded
marian
looking
her
thanks
i
am
much
pleased
with
the
place
and
its
near
vicinity
to
this
one
the
home
of
kind
and
congenial
relatives
remarked
hugh
lilburn
but
as
yet
we
are
not
entirely
sure
of
securing
it
you
know
the
old
saying
there
s
many
a
slip
twixt
the
cup
and
the
very
true
laddie
said
his
father
yet
in
this
case
i
feel
little
apprehension
of
do
you
not
like
the
house
cousin
hugh
asked
marian
it
suits
me
nicely
he
replied
and
i
think
you
can
hardly
fail
to
like
it
the
grounds
too
are
to
my
taste
i
think
if
we
are
successful
in
securing
it
it
will
make
us
a
delightful
by
the
next
evening
he
was
able
to
say
they
had
secured
it
and
would
get
possession
in
a
fortnight
marian
and
lulu
were
full
of
delight
and
indeed
every
one
seemed
much
pleased
will
you
move
in
as
soon
as
the
other
folks
are
out
cousin
ronald
asked
grace
we
hope
to
do
so
he
replied
however
we
shall
need
to
do
some
furnishing
first
this
is
saturday
evening
cousin
vi
do
you
think
you
and
your
mother
could
go
with
us
to
the
city
next
monday
and
help
us
make
our
selection
yes
indeed
i
shall
be
delighted
to
do
so
and
i
have
no
doubt
mamma
will
gladly
accompany
us
marian
is
to
be
one
of
the
party
i
suppose
oh
yes
if
the
captain
will
give
her
leave
of
absence
for
a
few
hours
certainly
for
an
occasion
so
important
the
captain
said
pleasantly
if
it
were
holiday
time
lulu
too
should
be
invited
to
accompany
us
remarked
lilburn
and
i
hope
there
will
be
another
time
when
she
thank
you
sir
i
should
be
glad
to
go
along
if
it
were
not
that
i
know
papa
wants
me
to
stay
at
home
and
attend
to
lessons
and
i
don
t
want
to
miss
them
as
our
holidays
will
soon
that
s
right
lassie
he
said
make
good
use
of
your
fine
opportunities
and
learn
all
you
can
in
these
young
days
that
you
may
be
the
better
prepared
for
usefulness
in
future
yes
sir
that
is
just
what
papa
often
says
to
us
replied
lulu
with
a
loving
smile
up
into
her
father
s
face
and
i
ve
found
out
that
he
always
knows
best
about
whatever
concerns
me
quite
a
fortunate
discovery
for
you
returned
lilburn
with
a
kindly
smile
while
the
captain
s
look
was
full
of
gratified
approval
my
dear
little
daughter
he
said
when
he
came
to
bid
her
in
her
room
your
willingness
to
stay
at
home
and
attend
to
lessons
instead
of
going
to
the
city
to
help
marian
with
her
shopping
pleases
me
very
much
because
it
shows
that
you
have
confidence
in
your
father
s
wisdom
and
his
love
for
he
smoothed
her
hair
caressingly
and
kissed
her
as
he
spoke
thank
you
for
telling
me
that
you
dear
papa
she
returned
her
eyes
shining
i
know
you
love
me
and
that
your
requirements
are
always
meant
for
my
good
also
that
you
are
very
wise
and
know
what
is
best
for
your
own
little
girl
oh
i
m
so
glad
i
am
your
very
own
she
added
hugging
him
with
all
her
strength
not
gladder
than
i
am
to
own
you
my
darling
he
said
repeating
his
caress
i
should
like
to
give
you
the
pleasure
of
going
were
it
not
that
i
feel
that
you
have
had
already
more
interruptions
to
your
studies
than
ought
really
to
have
been
yes
papa
i
believe
i
have
she
returned
and
as
i
do
want
to
be
as
well
educated
as
possible
so
that
i
may
be
very
useful
if
god
spares
my
life
i
really
do
not
want
you
to
indulge
me
more
in
and
holidays
than
you
think
chapter
xiv
the
next
day
was
the
sabbath
and
spent
as
that
holy
day
usually
was
by
our
friends
at
ion
woodburn
and
by
their
near
kindred
on
the
neighboring
estates
to
zoe
rejoicing
in
her
new
blessed
hope
that
she
was
indeed
a
child
of
god
and
an
heir
of
was
a
sweetly
solemn
and
happy
day
and
to
her
young
husband
almost
equally
so
they
attended
church
in
company
with
the
other
members
of
the
family
and
received
many
kindly
greetings
and
inquiries
in
regard
to
the
narrow
escape
of
thursday
night
grace
raymond
seemed
very
thoughtful
on
the
homeward
drive
papa
she
asked
at
length
do
trees
often
fall
suddenly
like
that
one
that
came
so
near
killing
aunt
zoe
and
the
rest
i
think
not
very
often
daughter
he
replied
i
have
heard
of
only
one
other
such
occurrence
some
years
ago
out
in
wisconsin
two
little
girls
sisters
were
walking
along
near
the
edge
of
one
of
those
pretty
little
lakes
of
which
there
are
so
many
in
that
state
when
suddenly
a
tree
fell
striking
one
of
the
children
to
the
ground
crushing
her
to
death
instantly
her
sister
who
had
escaped
unhurt
but
was
of
course
terribly
frightened
and
distressed
tried
hard
to
move
the
tree
and
drag
her
out
from
under
it
but
could
not
so
had
to
leave
her
there
and
go
for
help
they
were
the
children
of
a
poor
woman
who
was
washing
for
some
one
who
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
it
was
while
the
little
girls
were
on
their
way
to
their
mother
probably
to
see
her
home
when
her
day
s
work
was
done
that
this
dreadful
accident
oh
how
sad
sighed
grace
and
was
the
little
girl
the
tree
fell
on
dead
did
you
say
papa
yes
quite
dead
probably
instantly
killed
by
the
blow
it
seems
very
sad
yet
it
is
quite
possible
she
may
have
suffered
less
than
she
would
had
she
died
after
weeks
of
sickness
and
oh
it
makes
me
feel
afraid
to
go
into
the
woods
again
to
walk
or
to
it
need
not
daughter
it
is
a
rare
occurrence
we
all
have
to
die
somewhere
and
somehow
and
the
only
thing
that
need
concern
us
is
to
be
ready
whenever
god
shall
call
it
is
wrong
to
needlessly
rush
into
danger
and
throw
our
lives
away
we
have
no
right
to
do
that
though
we
have
a
right
and
it
is
a
duty
to
brave
danger
when
by
so
doing
we
can
save
others
and
if
we
love
the
lord
jesus
and
trust
in
him
for
salvation
we
need
not
be
afraid
of
sudden
death
for
sudden
death
will
be
to
us
sudden
glory
yea
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
me
thy
rod
and
thy
staff
they
comfort
it
is
very
sweet
to
know
that
jesus
will
be
with
us
through
that
dark
valley
papa
oh
i
should
be
so
afraid
to
go
alone
and
even
you
my
dear
father
who
loves
me
so
dearly
could
not
go
with
no
my
darling
dearly
as
i
love
you
i
will
have
to
let
you
go
alone
should
god
call
you
first
he
said
with
emotion
but
you
need
not
fear
to
go
nor
i
to
part
with
you
for
you
will
be
safe
in
the
arms
of
jesus
safe
on
his
gentle
yes
papa
and
if
i
go
first
how
glad
i
ll
be
when
you
come
and
if
you
go
first
how
glad
you
ll
be
to
see
me
when
i
yes
indeed
my
precious
child
and
to
greet
all
my
other
loved
ones
when
they
too
are
brought
home
and
we
are
all
there
together
free
from
sin
and
sorrow
and
pain
never
to
part
again
but
to
dwell
forever
with
the
lord
serving
him
in
joy
and
peace
and
love
throughout
a
blest
oh
what
a
blessed
hope
it
is
said
violet
tears
shining
in
her
eyes
and
how
thankful
i
am
that
almost
every
one
whom
i
love
very
dearly
is
a
christian
forever
with
the
lord
amen
so
let
it
be
life
from
the
dead
is
in
that
word
tis
marian
had
been
greatly
impressed
by
the
sermon
the
subject
of
which
was
the
shortness
and
uncertainty
of
life
she
was
very
quiet
and
thoughtful
that
afternoon
and
evening
but
woke
the
next
morning
full
of
thoughts
of
the
shopping
expedition
of
that
day
which
would
be
a
rather
new
experience
to
her
she
rose
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
busied
herself
with
her
lessons
for
the
day
and
at
was
able
to
tell
the
captain
that
she
felt
prepared
to
recite
then
or
on
her
return
from
the
city
if
it
suited
him
to
hear
her
yes
he
said
at
either
time
as
you
may
oh
thank
you
sir
she
returned
then
if
you
please
let
it
be
before
i
go
for
it
will
be
a
relief
to
have
them
off
my
mind
and
nothing
to
think
of
but
the
purchases
we
are
going
to
so
it
happened
that
the
recitations
were
over
before
the
arrival
of
the
carriage
from
ion
bringing
grandma
elsie
to
join
the
shoppers
rosie
and
walter
to
attend
to
school
duties
it
was
not
quite
time
to
begin
work
in
the
so
those
who
were
to
remain
behind
gathered
on
the
veranda
to
see
the
shoppers
off
lulu
watched
them
rather
wistfully
and
could
not
quite
repress
a
little
sigh
of
regret
that
she
was
not
to
be
of
the
number
but
catching
her
father
s
eye
and
smile
her
face
grew
bright
again
he
had
just
turned
and
stepped
back
into
the
veranda
after
handing
the
ladies
into
the
carriage
and
it
was
driving
away
toward
the
great
gates
opening
on
the
are
you
all
sadly
disappointed
at
being
left
behind
he
asked
addressing
the
little
group
collectively
i
should
be
sir
if
i
had
had
any
expectation
of
going
replied
rosie
putting
on
a
hurt
and
indignant
air
but
when
mamma
was
invited
the
other
evening
through
the
telephone
and
nothing
said
about
me
of
course
i
understood
that
i
was
not
wanted
in
the
no
little
sister
it
was
rather
that
you
were
wanted
in
the
replied
the
captain
with
a
slightly
amused
look
now
let
us
all
go
there
and
perhaps
we
may
pick
up
something
more
valuable
than
we
could
have
found
in
the
city
i
think
perhaps
we
may
papa
grace
said
with
a
bright
pleased
look
and
slipping
her
hand
into
his
i
think
so
too
papa
and
mean
to
try
my
very
best
said
lulu
taking
possession
of
his
other
hand
and
moving
on
with
him
and
grace
in
the
direction
of
the
rosie
and
walter
following
rosie
s
vexation
was
all
pretence
she
set
diligently
to
work
as
did
each
of
the
others
and
all
went
swimmingly
with
them
and
their
teacher
till
the
day
s
tasks
were
done
and
they
dismissed
to
their
sports
rosie
and
walter
had
permission
to
stay
at
woodburn
until
their
mother
s
return
which
was
not
till
near
so
they
dined
with
the
captain
and
his
children
and
they
were
a
very
merry
little
party
the
captain
jesting
with
them
all
in
a
way
to
both
entertain
the
older
ones
and
help
the
babies
to
forget
their
mother
s
absence
they
seemed
to
do
so
and
to
be
content
and
happy
with
their
father
and
sisters
yet
when
mamma
returned
to
them
received
her
with
demonstrations
of
delight
both
the
captain
and
violet
urged
grandma
elsie
to
stay
to
tea
keeping
rosie
and
walter
there
with
her
we
want
a
little
visit
from
you
mother
added
the
captain
would
be
very
glad
to
have
you
stay
all
night
and
as
much
longer
as
you
will
but
our
family
carriage
will
be
at
your
service
to
carry
you
to
ion
whenever
you
desire
to
yes
mamma
do
stay
at
least
till
after
tea
urged
walter
it
is
very
pleasant
here
about
as
pleasant
as
at
home
and
i
think
the
change
may
be
of
benefit
to
so
you
are
turning
doctor
are
you
walter
laughed
rosie
it
might
be
well
to
engage
cousin
art
to
superintend
your
studies
as
well
as
those
of
harold
and
herbert
though
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
rather
a
mistake
to
put
so
many
lads
out
of
one
family
into
one
that
is
a
question
that
may
be
considered
at
some
other
time
returned
walter
with
unmoved
gravity
mamma
you
will
stay
will
you
not
yes
since
a
visit
here
is
the
prescription
of
my
little
new
doctor
elsie
returned
with
a
smile
and
since
the
host
and
hostess
are
both
so
kindly
thank
you
mamma
said
rosie
i
am
well
pleased
with
your
decision
for
i
am
just
aching
to
question
marian
as
to
all
that
has
been
bought
for
the
furnishing
of
then
suppose
you
and
lulu
and
grace
come
with
me
to
my
room
proposed
marian
i
feel
quite
in
the
humor
for
talking
but
must
at
the
same
time
make
myself
neat
for
the
the
invitation
was
promptly
accepted
and
marian
made
her
toilet
with
the
others
looking
on
and
occasionally
giving
some
little
assistance
i
suppose
you
bought
beautiful
things
marian
observed
rosie
interrogatively
oh
yes
i
think
so
was
the
reply
cousin
ronald
was
oh
so
kind
cousin
hugh
also
they
both
seemed
to
want
me
to
have
everything
to
suit
my
taste
particularly
in
my
room
and
the
things
we
chose
are
very
pretty
i
think
though
of
course
not
nearly
so
expensive
as
the
furnishings
here
in
this
room
or
in
yours
and
grace
s
but
why
shouldn
t
they
be
queried
lulu
cousin
ronald
seems
to
have
plenty
of
money
and
to
think
everything
of
i
really
don
t
know
how
much
money
he
has
returned
marian
but
i
do
know
that
there
is
beechwood
to
be
paid
for
besides
the
ground
for
the
factory
and
the
buildings
that
have
to
be
put
up
and
i
m
sure
it
must
take
heaps
of
money
to
do
it
all
so
i
am
more
than
content
to
have
pretty
furnishings
that
do
not
cost
nearly
so
much
as
what
you
have
and
i
m
sure
that
s
just
the
right
way
to
feel
about
it
said
rosie
though
i
m
not
at
all
sure
it
would
have
occurred
to
me
to
take
all
that
into
very
likely
it
might
not
to
me
if
i
hadn
t
had
to
struggle
with
poverty
nearly
all
my
life
said
marian
then
she
went
on
to
give
a
minute
and
to
the
listening
girls
interesting
description
of
the
purchases
made
the
talk
at
the
that
evening
was
first
of
beechwood
and
a
few
repairs
and
alterations
needed
there
then
about
the
building
of
the
factory
the
engagement
of
workmen
and
women
and
the
markets
to
be
found
for
the
textile
fabrics
to
be
made
by
them
under
hugh
s
direction
and
supervision
then
plans
for
the
usual
summer
outing
in
the
cooler
climate
of
the
north
were
discussed
grandma
elsie
captain
raymond
and
violet
were
of
the
opinion
that
the
start
for
that
section
should
be
made
within
a
week
you
will
go
with
us
cousin
ronald
will
you
not
asked
grandma
elsie
turning
to
him
i
think
not
cousin
he
replied
i
want
to
be
here
to
help
my
laddie
with
his
building
and
the
adorning
of
the
house
that
s
to
make
a
home
for
marian
here
and
ourselves
smiling
kindly
upon
his
young
relative
as
he
spoke
but
i
quite
approve
of
her
accompanying
you
for
she
s
been
a
diligent
scholar
the
captain
tells
me
and
occasional
rest
and
diversions
are
very
good
and
desirable
things
for
the
no
better
than
for
the
old
cousin
ronald
returned
marian
with
a
grateful
loving
look
into
his
eyes
and
if
you
don
t
need
them
i
do
not
i
am
sure
i
ve
had
a
very
great
change
of
scene
and
life
and
a
long
journey
too
within
the
last
few
months
you
know
and
now
there
is
nothing
i
should
enjoy
more
than
staying
here
and
helping
you
to
put
the
new
home
in
order
and
place
the
pretty
furniture
we
bought
cousin
ronald
and
hugh
both
looked
much
pleased
with
her
choice
ah
lassie
you
appreciate
your
privileges
said
lilburn
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
but
everybody
has
not
so
many
privileges
or
so
great
as
mine
returned
marian
her
eyes
shining
chapter
xv
the
captain
s
pupils
were
jubilant
over
the
prospect
of
soon
leaving
for
the
at
the
north
inquiries
in
regard
to
different
locations
had
been
set
on
foot
some
weeks
previous
and
now
it
was
decided
to
take
possession
for
the
season
of
several
dwellings
in
the
neighborhood
of
cape
ann
mass
in
one
of
them
which
was
quite
large
too
large
to
be
called
a
cottage
the
ion
and
woodburn
families
would
be
together
much
of
the
time
a
little
building
near
at
hand
containing
the
overflow
when
guests
would
render
accommodations
at
the
larger
house
too
small
edward
and
zoe
with
their
little
ones
would
remain
at
home
for
the
present
that
he
might
oversee
the
work
on
the
plantation
and
the
fairview
family
would
go
for
a
time
at
least
to
evelyn
s
home
on
the
banks
of
the
hudson
the
families
at
the
oaks
and
the
laurels
were
not
going
north
at
present
but
might
do
later
in
the
season
the
raymonds
were
to
take
their
journey
by
sea
in
the
the
others
with
their
guests
going
by
rail
that
was
the
plan
at
first
but
only
a
day
or
two
before
they
started
mary
keith
received
a
letter
from
her
father
giving
her
permission
to
accept
an
invitation
from
the
relatives
to
spend
the
summer
with
them
at
the
which
she
did
with
delight
oh
i
am
so
glad
mary
violet
exclaimed
when
she
heard
the
news
and
i
want
you
to
go
with
us
on
the
won
t
you
it
will
be
a
new
and
i
hope
pleasant
experience
for
you
and
we
shall
be
so
glad
to
have
your
captain
raymond
who
was
present
warmly
seconded
the
invitation
and
mary
accepted
it
this
talk
was
at
ion
where
the
captain
and
violet
were
making
a
short
call
they
took
their
leave
almost
immediately
saying
that
the
time
for
their
preparations
for
leaving
home
was
growing
very
short
and
there
were
a
number
of
matters
still
claiming
their
attention
before
they
had
reached
the
avenue
gates
the
captain
turned
to
his
wife
saying
i
think
my
dear
if
you
have
no
objection
we
will
drive
over
to
roselands
for
a
short
call
before
going
home
i
want
to
say
a
few
words
to
there
was
a
twinkle
of
fun
in
his
eye
and
violet
returned
laughingly
yes
i
understand
let
us
go
by
all
on
reaching
roselands
they
did
not
alight
but
said
to
calhoun
who
came
out
to
welcome
them
that
they
were
in
haste
only
wanted
a
few
words
with
him
and
then
must
return
home
yes
he
said
you
leave
day
after
i
believe
is
there
something
you
would
like
me
to
attend
to
for
you
in
your
absence
captain
no
thank
you
was
the
smiling
reply
what
we
want
is
to
take
you
with
us
you
have
not
taken
a
holiday
for
years
we
have
plenty
of
room
for
you
on
the
yacht
and
can
assure
you
of
pleasant
very
pleasantest
you
could
have
for
cousin
mary
keith
has
consented
to
go
with
and
you
think
that
furnishes
an
additional
inducement
calhoun
returned
coloring
and
laughing
well
i
won
t
deny
that
it
does
but
this
is
very
you
needn
t
decide
at
once
talk
it
over
with
art
and
we
shall
hope
you
will
decide
to
go
we
shall
be
glad
to
take
you
as
a
passenger
though
it
should
be
at
the
last
minute
and
with
the
last
word
the
carriage
started
down
the
avenue
arthur
called
that
evening
to
thank
the
captain
for
the
invitation
to
calhoun
and
say
that
it
would
be
accepted
he
really
needs
a
rest
he
said
and
though
i
had
some
difficulty
in
persuading
him
that
he
could
be
done
without
for
a
few
weeks
i
succeeded
at
last
though
a
bit
of
information
about
a
certain
passenger
he
added
with
a
smile
had
probably
more
to
do
with
his
acceptance
than
anything
o
cousin
arthur
i
wish
you
could
go
too
exclaimed
violet
don
t
you
think
you
could
yes
can
t
you
asked
the
captain
we
should
be
delighted
to
have
you
for
the
sake
of
your
pleasant
company
to
say
nothing
of
the
convenience
of
having
our
medical
adviser
close
at
hand
in
case
of
sickness
or
thank
you
kindly
returned
the
doctor
i
should
greatly
enjoy
going
especially
in
such
pleasant
company
but
it
would
not
do
for
cal
and
me
to
absent
ourselves
at
one
and
the
same
time
besides
i
have
some
patients
that
i
could
not
leave
just
at
then
take
your
turn
after
calhoun
comes
home
said
the
captain
he
would
be
a
welcome
guest
as
long
as
he
might
choose
to
stay
but
if
i
know
him
as
i
think
i
do
he
is
not
likely
to
stay
as
long
as
we
no
not
he
said
arthur
if
he
stays
two
or
three
weeks
it
will
be
quite
as
much
as
i
and
we
shall
hope
to
see
you
after
that
said
the
captain
don
t
forget
that
all
work
and
no
play
makes
jack
a
dull
boy
and
we
could
ill
afford
to
have
our
doctor
so
many
thanks
returned
arthur
i
sometimes
feel
that
such
a
rest
would
do
me
a
world
of
good
and
perhaps
prevent
or
delay
such
a
catastrophe
as
you
speak
of
he
added
with
a
smile
but
it
is
really
a
very
difficult
thing
for
a
busy
country
doctor
to
get
away
from
his
work
for
even
a
brief
yes
but
i
think
he
should
take
one
occasionally
nevertheless
said
the
captain
since
by
so
doing
he
is
likely
to
last
the
longer
and
in
the
end
do
more
for
his
very
pleasant
doctrine
captain
laughed
arthur
but
i
must
be
going
now
as
some
of
these
same
are
in
need
of
my
services
at
this
present
i
wish
you
were
going
with
us
now
art
said
violet
as
she
bade
him
it
would
be
really
delightful
to
have
you
along
as
friend
and
relative
as
well
as
that
is
very
good
and
kind
in
you
he
returned
i
won
t
forget
it
and
perhaps
i
may
look
in
on
you
before
the
summer
is
that
day
and
the
next
were
very
busy
ones
at
woodburn
and
ion
and
the
succeeding
one
saw
them
all
on
their
way
northward
mary
keith
was
delighted
with
the
yacht
which
she
had
not
seen
until
she
boarded
it
in
company
with
the
raymonds
it
was
a
pleasure
to
violet
to
take
her
cousin
down
into
the
cabin
and
show
her
all
its
beauties
and
conveniences
including
the
she
was
to
occupy
on
the
voyage
oh
how
lovely
cried
mary
and
how
good
in
you
to
ask
me
to
go
with
you
in
this
beautiful
vessel
i
am
sure
the
journey
will
not
be
half
so
wearisome
as
it
would
in
the
i
hope
not
returned
violet
but
i
hope
you
won
t
be
for
if
you
are
you
will
probably
wish
we
had
not
induced
you
to
try
the
voyage
in
preference
to
the
journey
by
and
perhaps
that
you
had
my
doctor
brother
as
instead
of
myself
remarked
a
familiar
voice
behind
of
calhoun
turning
quickly
they
discovered
him
and
the
captain
standing
near
by
regarding
them
with
amused
smiling
countenances
welcome
i
m
glad
to
see
you
cal
said
violet
holding
out
her
hand
thank
you
vi
he
returned
taking
the
hand
in
a
cordial
grasp
and
you
miss
mary
are
not
displeased
i
hope
that
i
have
accepted
an
invitation
to
join
your
party
on
the
voyage
and
for
a
short
time
at
the
no
conly
laughed
mary
whom
the
captain
and
violet
choose
to
invite
is
i
am
sure
no
affair
of
mine
nor
should
i
object
to
your
company
so
long
as
you
continue
so
inoffensive
as
you
have
been
during
our
brief
thanks
he
returned
bowing
low
now
i
feel
entirely
that
s
right
cal
said
the
captain
and
suppose
we
all
go
on
deck
to
see
the
weighing
of
the
anchor
and
the
starting
of
the
vessel
for
the
steam
is
up
and
we
are
about
ready
to
an
awning
shaded
the
deck
and
a
breeze
from
the
sea
made
it
a
pleasant
place
to
lounge
and
read
or
chat
the
children
were
already
seated
there
watching
the
movements
of
the
sailors
and
of
the
people
on
the
wharf
how
d
y
do
cousin
cal
said
lulu
making
room
for
him
and
mary
keith
on
the
settee
she
had
been
occupying
i
m
glad
you
are
going
with
us
and
i
hope
you
and
cousin
mary
will
have
a
good
time
for
i
think
a
journey
taken
on
the
is
very
much
more
enjoyable
than
one
by
i
have
no
doubt
of
one
is
not
attacked
by
returned
calhoun
are
you
likely
to
be
she
asked
well
that
i
can
not
tell
as
this
will
be
my
first
voyage
he
answered
as
it
is
mine
said
mary
if
you
are
both
sick
you
can
sympathize
each
with
the
other
remarked
violet
laughingly
but
the
captain
had
walked
forward
to
give
his
orders
the
work
of
weighing
anchor
was
beginning
and
all
kept
silence
while
watching
it
presently
the
vessel
was
speeding
on
her
way
and
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
sit
under
the
awning
enjoying
the
breeze
and
the
prospect
of
the
wide
expanse
of
ocean
on
the
one
side
and
the
shore
on
the
other
the
voyage
proved
a
speedy
and
prosperous
one
continuous
fair
weather
and
favorable
winds
making
it
most
enjoyable
one
pleasant
afternoon
they
entered
gloucester
harbor
and
before
night
were
safely
housed
in
their
new
temporary
home
where
they
found
the
dinsmores
and
travillas
awaiting
them
croly
too
was
there
to
join
in
the
greetings
domiciled
with
relatives
who
occupied
a
cottage
but
a
few
rods
distant
he
passed
much
of
his
time
with
harold
and
herbert
fishing
boating
bathing
riding
or
driving
pleasures
that
were
now
shared
by
the
other
gentlemen
and
ladies
and
more
or
less
by
the
children
also
the
captain
young
uncles
and
occasionally
croly
caring
for
them
when
in
bathing
and
seeing
that
they
had
a
fair
share
of
the
pleasures
of
the
older
people
there
were
many
beautiful
drives
to
be
taken
some
interesting
spots
to
visit
one
day
they
took
a
long
drive
much
of
it
through
a
pleasant
wood
whence
they
emerged
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
there
very
high
and
rocky
they
fastened
their
horses
in
the
edge
of
the
wood
alighted
and
walked
out
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
of
the
dashing
booming
waves
stepping
across
a
narrow
fissure
in
the
rocks
the
gentlemen
helping
the
ladies
and
children
over
they
could
see
that
it
widened
toward
the
water
and
that
the
sea
roared
and
foamed
like
a
seething
caldron
about
the
base
of
the
rocks
which
were
very
steep
and
uneven
in
many
places
great
stones
piled
upon
each
other
in
a
way
that
made
them
look
as
if
it
would
take
very
little
to
send
them
toppling
down
into
the
roaring
fuming
water
below
grace
clung
to
her
father
in
affright
o
papa
please
don
t
let
us
go
any
nearer
she
said
please
hold
me
i
will
my
darling
he
answered
soothingly
we
are
in
no
danger
here
and
you
can
just
stand
and
look
seeing
all
you
need
care
to
then
i
will
take
you
back
to
mamma
over
yonder
where
she
is
gathering
flowers
for
elsie
and
ned
and
you
can
stay
with
and
amuse
them
while
she
comes
here
to
take
a
yes
i
d
rather
be
there
she
said
for
it
seems
so
dangerous
here
o
papa
see
lu
is
going
so
near
the
edge
i
m
afraid
she
ll
fall
uncle
harold
has
her
hand
he
said
still
i
do
not
like
to
see
her
venturing
so
near
the
edge
lucilla
he
called
come
here
she
turned
about
and
came
at
once
uncle
harold
was
taking
care
of
me
papa
she
said
but
oh
it
does
look
dangerous
and
i
shouldn
t
like
to
go
climbing
about
over
the
rocks
as
cousin
mary
and
rosie
are
doing
at
least
not
unless
i
had
you
to
hold
me
i
shall
not
take
you
into
any
such
dangerous
place
he
said
nor
will
i
allow
any
one
else
to
do
so
do
you
see
that
little
cross
there
pointing
to
a
small
wooden
one
driven
in
the
rock
near
by
yes
sir
what
is
it
there
for
asked
lulu
as
a
reminder
of
a
sad
accident
that
happened
here
some
years
ago
a
party
of
summer
visitors
to
this
coast
came
out
here
one
day
as
we
have
done
and
went
down
near
the
waves
among
them
was
a
very
estimable
young
lady
a
christian
i
believe
she
was
a
teacher
too
supporting
her
aged
parents
by
her
industry
she
was
soon
to
be
married
and
with
her
were
the
parents
of
her
intended
husband
it
seems
they
all
went
down
near
the
waves
this
young
lady
nearer
than
the
others
she
seated
herself
on
the
rock
against
which
the
waves
dash
up
some
of
the
others
called
to
her
that
she
was
not
in
a
safe
place
but
she
replied
that
she
thought
it
safe
the
waves
did
not
come
up
close
to
her
and
they
looked
away
in
another
direction
for
a
moment
when
they
turned
to
look
for
her
again
she
was
gone
from
the
rock
and
all
they
could
see
of
her
was
one
hand
held
up
out
of
the
boiling
waves
as
if
in
a
wild
appeal
for
help
help
which
they
could
not
give
for
they
had
no
boat
and
no
other
way
of
reaching
was
she
drowned
papa
asked
grace
yes
my
child
she
could
not
live
many
minutes
amid
such
waves
and
rocks
they
made
all
the
haste
they
could
to
get
help
but
none
was
near
at
hand
and
she
must
have
been
dead
long
before
they
got
it
there
they
did
get
the
body
finally
with
grappling
irons
but
the
soul
had
fled
my
children
remember
what
i
say
to
you
now
never
run
the
risk
of
losing
your
lives
when
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
it
for
either
yourselves
or
others
to
do
so
is
both
wrong
and
foolish
it
is
really
breaking
the
sixth
thou
shalt
not
we
have
no
right
to
kill
ourselves
not
even
to
escape
great
suffering
but
must
wait
god
s
time
to
call
us
hence
now
i
will
take
you
to
your
little
sister
and
brother
to
take
charge
of
them
while
your
mamma
comes
to
view
rafe
s
in
the
mean
time
grandma
elsie
had
called
to
rosie
and
walter
and
was
talking
to
them
in
much
the
same
strain
of
the
folly
and
sinfulness
of
unnecessarily
exposing
themselves
to
danger
you
can
see
almost
as
much
from
this
safe
place
as
you
can
by
going
into
those
very
dangerous
ones
she
said
then
she
told
them
the
same
story
the
captain
had
just
been
telling
his
little
girls
o
mamma
how
dreadful
how
very
dreadful
exclaimed
rosie
it
was
so
sad
to
be
snatched
away
from
life
so
suddenly
while
young
and
well
and
with
so
much
to
live
yes
sighed
her
mother
my
heart
aches
for
the
poor
parents
even
more
than
for
the
lover
he
has
probably
found
another
bride
before
this
while
they
still
mourn
the
irreparable
loss
of
their
dear
your
mother
is
right
children
said
dinsmore
standing
near
heed
her
teachings
and
never
risk
life
or
limb
in
a
mere
spirit
of
the
captain
now
stood
beside
them
with
violet
on
his
arm
and
the
others
came
climbing
back
till
they
all
stood
in
a
group
together
what
an
awful
occurrence
that
was
what
a
dreadful
death
to
about
by
those
booming
waves
that
raging
foaming
water
against
those
cruel
rocks
till
life
was
extinct
violet
said
gazing
down
into
the
chasm
while
clinging
tightly
to
her
husband
s
arm
yes
said
mary
keith
and
i
feel
that
i
was
hardly
right
to
run
the
risk
i
did
in
climbing
about
as
i
have
been
nor
i
said
croly
nor
any
of
the
rest
of
us
added
calhoun
but
we
won
t
do
it
any
more
but
what
is
it
vi
refers
to
has
there
ever
been
an
accident
here
yes
have
you
not
heard
the
story
said
his
uncle
has
no
one
told
you
the
meaning
of
yonder
cross
pointing
to
it
as
he
spoke
no
sir
and
i
had
not
noticed
it
dinsmore
briefly
told
the
sad
tale
then
slowly
and
almost
in
silence
they
turned
and
left
the
spot
harold
herbert
and
will
croly
were
strolling
together
along
the
beach
that
evening
and
for
a
time
their
talk
was
of
rafe
s
chasm
and
the
accident
there
the
story
of
which
they
had
heard
that
day
it
has
been
a
good
deal
in
my
mind
ever
since
i
heard
it
remarked
croly
and
i
have
asked
myself
what
must
it
be
to
be
called
so
suddenly
from
earth
to
heaven
it
is
a
solemn
thought
that
we
may
be
so
called
any
day
or
hour
but
a
sweet
one
also
for
to
the
christian
what
is
sudden
death
but
sudden
glory
a
sudden
awaking
in
the
land
where
pain
and
sickness
sin
and
sorrow
are
unknown
and
in
the
immediate
presence
of
the
dear
master
who
has
loved
us
with
an
everlasting
love
oh
i
can
not
think
sudden
death
a
calamity
to
the
christian
no
said
harold
but
it
is
sad
for
the
surviving
relatives
and
friends
oh
what
a
thing
to
lose
our
mother
in
that
way
for
instance
yes
such
a
terrible
death
said
herbert
in
moved
tones
but
the
suffering
was
very
short
said
croly
doubtless
consciousness
was
soon
lost
and
i
have
heard
again
and
again
that
those
who
have
been
taken
from
the
water
apparently
nearly
gone
that
if
left
to
themselves
they
would
never
have
recovered
said
that
it
was
an
easy
death
to
die
those
who
die
by
disease
must
often
and
often
suffer
far
more
in
the
weeks
and
months
while
disease
is
slowly
making
its
way
to
the
citadel
of
yes
that
is
true
answered
harold
yet
thinking
of
it
all
does
not
rouse
in
me
any
desire
for
drowning
i
believe
i
have
never
told
you
will
he
added
facing
round
upon
his
friend
and
speaking
in
tones
slightly
tremulous
with
emotion
that
i
was
once
as
near
drowning
as
one
could
be
and
live
yes
should
probably
never
have
recovered
consciousness
but
for
my
dear
mother
s
determined
perseverance
with
efforts
at
resuscitation
when
every
one
else
had
given
me
up
as
no
returned
croly
in
an
awestruck
tone
i
never
heard
it
before
no
wonder
you
love
her
so
dearly
for
leaving
that
out
of
the
account
she
is
a
woman
in
a
thousand
ah
i
often
envy
you
fellows
when
i
see
you
with
your
mother
and
think
of
mine
sick
and
suffering
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
but
you
are
hoping
she
and
your
father
will
return
soon
are
you
not
will
asked
herbert
in
a
tone
of
sympathy
yes
i
am
hoping
every
day
to
hear
that
they
are
about
sailing
but
i
have
heard
nothing
at
all
for
some
weeks
and
am
growing
more
anxious
day
by
day
aunt
and
uncle
try
to
comfort
and
reassure
me
with
the
old
saying
that
no
news
is
good
news
my
only
comfort
is
in
casting
my
cares
on
the
lord
remembering
that
he
cares
for
both
them
and
me
and
that
his
promise
is
as
thy
days
so
shall
thy
strength
that
is
one
of
my
mother
s
favorite
texts
remarked
herbert
and
she
says
it
has
always
been
fulfilled
to
and
she
has
seen
some
sore
trials
yes
my
father
s
death
for
one
i
know
that
was
the
greatest
of
all
though
before
that
death
had
snatched
away
from
her
a
very
dear
and
lovely
little
daughter
said
harold
and
she
has
had
trials
in
other
forms
added
herbert
some
persons
would
esteem
it
a
very
great
trial
to
be
called
to
choose
between
a
difficult
and
dangerous
surgical
operation
and
certain
painful
death
from
and
she
has
had
that
trial
asked
croly
yes
and
went
through
it
bravely
trusting
in
the
lord
to
spare
her
life
or
take
her
to
dwell
with
him
in
bliss
she
is
a
noble
and
lovely
woman
remarked
croly
i
never
saw
one
whom
i
admired
ah
you
do
not
know
half
how
sweet
and
good
and
what
a
devoted
christian
beloved
said
harold
earnestly
i
thank
god
every
day
for
giving
me
such
a
as
i
do
said
herbert
i
often
think
if
there
is
anything
good
in
me
it
is
the
result
of
my
mother
s
kind
wise
loving
chapter
xvi
the
next
day
was
the
third
since
the
arrival
of
the
raymonds
rain
fell
heavily
there
was
no
church
near
at
hand
and
our
friends
gathered
in
the
parlors
of
the
house
occupied
by
the
dinsmores
travillas
and
raymonds
where
a
sermon
was
read
prayers
were
offered
and
hymns
sung
in
the
evening
they
held
a
and
afterward
sang
hymns
now
selected
or
suggested
by
one
now
by
another
croly
chose
several
he
had
been
with
them
in
the
morning
and
offered
a
very
feeling
fervent
prayer
the
first
two
verses
of
the
last
hymn
sung
at
his
request
were
my
days
are
gliding
swiftly
by
and
i
a
pilgrim
stranger
would
not
detain
them
as
they
fly
these
hours
of
toil
and
danger
for
oh
we
stand
on
jordan
s
strand
our
friends
are
passing
over
and
just
before
the
shining
shore
we
may
almost
discover
our
absent
king
the
gave
let
every
lamp
be
burning
we
look
afar
across
the
wave
our
distant
home
discerning
for
oh
we
stand
on
jordan
s
strand
our
friends
are
passing
over
and
just
before
the
shining
shore
we
may
almost
monday
was
a
bright
beautiful
day
spent
by
our
friends
very
much
as
usual
they
had
been
unusually
long
without
letters
from
their
homes
or
that
vicinity
and
were
growing
a
trifle
anxious
calhoun
in
especial
as
he
felt
that
he
himself
had
had
a
good
vacation
and
it
was
time
that
his
brother
the
doctor
was
taking
his
turn
yet
there
was
a
very
strong
tie
binding
him
for
the
present
to
the
spot
where
he
was
he
and
mary
keith
had
come
to
an
understanding
and
were
mutual
lovers
only
awaiting
the
consent
of
her
parents
to
become
engaged
he
had
written
to
keith
telling
him
frankly
of
his
circumstances
and
prospects
his
love
for
mary
and
desire
to
make
her
his
wife
at
the
earliest
day
on
which
her
parents
could
be
induced
to
resign
her
to
him
also
of
her
willingness
to
become
his
concluding
his
letter
by
a
reference
to
their
cousin
and
his
uncle
dinsmore
for
any
desired
information
in
regard
to
his
character
and
the
correctness
of
his
statements
concerning
his
ability
present
and
prospective
to
support
a
wife
and
family
he
and
mary
walked
out
that
morning
soon
after
breakfast
strolled
along
the
beach
for
a
time
then
seated
themselves
within
sight
of
their
temporary
home
they
had
hardly
done
so
when
walter
travilla
came
running
with
letters
which
he
said
had
just
come
from
the
office
there
are
several
for
each
of
you
you
are
fortunate
this
morning
he
added
however
that
depends
very
much
upon
what
is
in
so
it
does
wal
said
calhoun
glancing
at
his
and
perceiving
that
the
direction
on
one
of
them
was
in
a
masculine
hand
and
the
postmark
that
of
the
town
where
mary
s
parents
lived
his
pulses
quickened
at
the
sight
and
his
face
flushed
walter
had
run
away
and
mary
was
breaking
the
seal
of
her
own
letter
from
home
she
seemed
too
busy
with
it
to
notice
the
excitement
of
her
companion
seeing
which
he
silently
opened
and
read
his
to
himself
the
two
epistles
were
of
much
the
same
tone
and
tenor
the
parents
though
feeling
it
a
sore
trial
to
part
with
their
eldest
full
consent
since
that
seemed
necessary
to
her
happiness
mary
s
feelings
as
she
read
were
of
strangely
mingled
happiness
and
heartache
she
loved
the
man
at
her
side
loved
him
so
dearly
that
she
could
scarce
have
borne
to
resign
him
yet
the
thought
of
leaving
the
dear
parents
who
had
loved
and
cherished
her
all
her
days
was
almost
equally
unendurable
her
tears
began
to
fall
and
the
sound
of
a
low
sob
startled
calhoun
just
as
he
finished
the
perusal
of
keith
s
letter
which
brought
only
joy
to
him
oh
dearest
what
is
it
he
asked
passing
an
arm
about
her
waist
does
that
letter
bring
you
bad
news
mine
gives
me
only
the
joyful
intelligence
of
your
parents
consent
so
that
i
have
a
right
to
comfort
you
in
any
trouble
if
it
lies
in
my
do
not
be
vexed
or
offended
that
the
same
news
is
not
all
joy
to
me
she
returned
smiling
through
her
tears
my
father
and
mother
are
very
very
dear
to
me
they
have
loved
and
cherished
me
all
my
life
their
home
has
always
been
mine
but
overcome
by
emotion
she
ended
with
a
sob
leaving
her
sentence
unfinished
and
you
are
giving
them
up
for
me
a
comparative
stranger
and
far
from
worthy
of
such
a
prize
as
yourself
he
said
in
low
tender
tones
taking
her
hand
and
pressing
it
affectionately
in
his
dear
girl
if
love
tenderness
entire
devotion
can
make
you
happy
you
shall
never
regret
the
i
have
no
fear
of
that
she
returned
smiling
through
her
tears
for
though
but
a
few
weeks
have
passed
since
we
first
saw
each
other
you
are
well
known
to
us
through
uncle
dinsmore
cousin
elsie
and
others
i
do
not
fear
to
trust
no
it
is
not
that
but
the
leaving
of
the
dear
father
and
mother
they
begin
to
grow
old
and
may
need
a
daughter
s
but
they
have
other
daughters
yes
but
i
am
the
eldest
and
the
one
who
would
perhaps
know
best
how
to
make
them
well
dearest
let
us
leave
that
for
the
present
there
is
plenty
of
room
at
roselands
and
your
father
some
day
retire
from
may
like
to
come
and
make
their
home
with
us
if
so
we
shall
be
glad
very
glad
to
have
that
was
a
word
of
comfort
that
chased
mary
s
tears
away
and
the
rest
of
their
talk
was
gay
and
happy
the
principal
subject
their
plans
for
the
immediate
future
i
ought
to
be
going
home
remarked
calhoun
at
length
with
a
slight
sigh
though
the
fact
is
i
don
t
know
how
to
tear
myself
away
but
i
must
for
poor
overworked
art
must
have
his
turn
ah
here
s
a
letter
from
him
taking
up
one
from
the
still
unexamined
pile
lying
on
the
grass
by
his
side
hastily
tearing
it
open
he
glanced
over
the
contents
why
here
is
news
he
exclaimed
marian
mcalpine
has
been
quite
ill
art
attending
her
she
s
convalescing
but
needs
change
of
climate
and
scene
art
has
prescribed
a
few
weeks
at
the
and
they
are
coming
whole
four
of
lilburn
and
his
son
miss
marian
and
art
as
her
attending
physician
i
am
commissioned
to
find
a
for
them
but
what
are
they
thinking
of
they
were
to
start
the
day
after
this
was
written
and
will
probably
be
here
or
oh
well
there
are
hotels
in
the
town
and
i
must
just
hurry
in
there
make
inquiries
and
do
the
best
i
can
for
yes
let
us
go
back
to
the
house
at
once
said
mary
but
ah
here
comes
cousin
elsie
she
added
as
they
both
rose
and
turned
toward
the
dwelling
you
had
a
letter
from
art
i
noticed
calhoun
said
travilla
hastening
toward
them
and
i
presume
it
brings
the
same
news
as
this
one
from
cousin
ronald
to
me
indicating
one
that
she
held
in
her
hand
he
says
marian
has
been
really
very
ill
but
is
convalescing
and
they
are
bringing
her
here
thinking
the
may
do
her
good
he
says
arthur
is
coming
along
as
her
physician
but
agrees
with
him
that
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
for
you
to
hurry
home
as
edward
is
able
and
willing
to
give
some
little
attention
to
the
workers
on
your
that
is
good
news
calhoun
said
with
a
smile
but
i
must
hurry
into
the
city
and
find
a
for
why
cal
you
astonish
me
exclaimed
elsie
have
i
ever
shown
myself
so
inhospitable
that
you
have
a
right
to
suppose
i
would
let
relatives
go
to
a
hotel
when
i
can
make
room
for
them
in
my
home
i
didn
t
think
you
could
cousin
he
returned
i
both
can
and
will
if
i
am
allowed
the
opportunity
it
is
only
a
little
crowding
that
is
necessary
conly
can
take
his
brother
the
doctor
into
his
room
to
share
his
bed
cousin
ronald
and
his
son
can
share
there
is
a
spare
room
waiting
for
marian
can
be
taken
in
with
some
of
us
i
have
not
thought
it
all
out
yet
but
am
confident
i
can
soon
arrange
oh
easily
cousin
said
mary
for
rosie
and
i
could
easily
take
lulu
or
grace
or
both
of
them
into
our
room
crowding
at
the
is
nothing
new
and
i
do
not
think
it
will
be
at
all
unpleasant
to
you
are
a
dear
good
girl
mary
was
elsie
s
smiling
response
as
she
turned
and
hastened
back
to
the
house
she
has
her
full
share
of
the
southern
virtue
of
hospitality
remarked
calhoun
looking
after
her
with
admiring
eyes
do
you
consider
it
a
specially
southern
virtue
queried
mary
with
a
little
laugh
of
amusement
i
beg
your
pardon
returned
calhoun
gallantly
and
acknowledge
that
i
have
seen
no
lack
of
the
virtue
in
question
since
coming
up
north
but
i
have
always
heard
it
spoken
of
as
particularly
characteristic
of
my
native
section
of
the
union
though
i
dare
say
that
is
altogether
a
i
shall
try
to
convince
you
of
that
one
of
these
days
she
said
with
a
smiling
look
up
into
his
eyes
when
travilla
reached
the
house
there
was
first
a
short
consultation
among
the
older
members
of
the
family
then
a
pleasant
little
bustle
of
preparation
for
the
expected
welcome
guests
who
it
was
found
could
be
easily
accommodated
without
greatly
disturbing
or
interfering
with
the
comfort
of
any
one
else
these
preparations
completed
all
gathered
on
the
porch
and
sat
there
the
gentlemen
reading
the
ladies
crocheting
or
merely
chatting
to
pass
away
the
time
till
the
should
summon
them
to
the
table
but
a
carriage
was
seen
approaching
from
the
direction
of
the
town
i
wonder
now
if
it
isn
t
our
party
said
calhoun
and
even
as
he
spoke
it
drove
up
and
stopped
before
the
gate
seeing
which
he
harold
and
herbert
sprang
up
and
hastened
forward
to
assist
the
travellers
to
alight
for
it
was
indeed
the
expected
party
of
relatives
from
the
south
the
gentlemen
were
all
well
and
in
fine
spirits
but
marian
was
much
exhausted
and
glad
to
be
taken
directly
to
bed
the
doctor
seemed
very
careful
of
his
patient
the
other
two
equally
solicitous
for
her
comfort
as
were
dinsmore
elsie
and
violet
all
of
whom
were
ready
to
do
for
her
anything
in
their
power
all
she
wanted
however
was
a
little
light
nourishment
then
a
long
sound
sleep
and
the
next
morning
she
was
able
to
occupy
a
hammock
swung
upon
the
porch
where
she
passed
her
time
listening
to
reading
generally
by
the
doctor
who
rarely
left
her
long
for
the
first
day
or
two
chatting
with
the
cousins
or
sleeping
weakness
and
the
having
somewhat
the
effect
of
an
opiate
but
both
the
air
and
the
sleep
did
her
great
good
so
that
in
a
few
days
she
was
able
to
take
short
drives
and
even
walks
along
the
beach
with
the
support
of
the
arm
of
one
or
another
of
the
gentlemen
oftener
that
of
arthur
than
any
other
he
watched
over
her
with
the
care
and
tenderness
of
a
mother
noticed
the
first
sign
of
exhaustion
and
it
was
always
he
who
helped
her
up
the
stairs
to
her
bedroom
not
infrequently
her
there
all
the
older
members
of
the
family
noticed
his
devotion
and
quietly
remarked
upon
it
among
themselves
he
is
really
in
love
with
her
i
think
but
it
seems
to
me
the
disparity
of
years
is
too
great
remarked
herbert
one
day
when
the
matter
was
under
discussion
perhaps
laddie
when
you
come
to
be
of
his
age
you
may
see
such
matters
in
a
different
light
said
lilburn
in
a
fatherly
tone
and
with
a
kindly
smile
at
his
young
relative
as
his
mother
did
before
him
added
elsie
laying
her
hand
affectionately
in
that
of
herbert
who
was
as
usual
close
at
her
side
ah
mamma
dear
i
quite
forgot
at
the
moment
that
you
had
married
one
so
much
older
than
yourself
but
my
father
was
no
common
no
nor
is
cousin
arthur
at
least
so
we
all
think
we
to
whom
he
has
always
been
so
kind
and
faithful
as
both
relative
and
yes
said
dinsmore
and
any
one
who
is
so
fortunate
as
to
win
his
heart
and
hand
will
have
one
of
the
best
most
affectionate
and
attentive
of
and
the
disparity
of
years
will
not
be
so
very
much
greater
than
between
cousin
mary
and
his
brother
remarked
dinsmore
and
they
seem
a
delightfully
happy
pair
as
a
certain
married
couple
of
my
acquaintance
between
whom
there
must
be
something
like
the
same
disparity
of
years
are
to
my
actual
knowledge
remarked
violet
with
a
bright
fond
look
up
into
her
husband
s
face
as
he
sat
by
her
side
with
baby
ned
on
his
knee
quite
true
my
dear
i
could
not
be
induced
to
exchange
my
one
little
wife
for
half
a
dozen
women
of
twice
her
years
even
if
the
law
allowed
it
returned
the
captain
with
a
humorous
look
and
smile
nor
could
i
be
induced
to
exchange
my
one
good
big
husband
for
a
dozen
or
more
other
men
of
any
age
size
or
quality
laughed
violet
wise
vi
remarked
herbert
one
is
plenty
more
than
one
would
certainly
be
a
superfluity
toward
the
shore
everybody
yonder
are
cal
and
his
beloved
wandering
together
near
the
waves
seemingly
in
close
conversation
while
art
and
his
sit
side
by
side
on
two
a
little
nearer
here
or
a
trifle
farther
from
the
water
there
is
certainly
a
good
deal
of
going
at
least
things
have
that
appearance
harold
said
with
a
quiet
smile
as
he
and
the
others
followed
herbert
s
advice
and
gazing
out
seaward
had
a
pretty
view
of
the
two
pairs
of
lovers
there
was
little
doubt
in
any
of
their
minds
that
arthur
and
marian
belonged
in
that
class
while
the
other
two
were
openly
acknowledged
as
such
but
they
were
somewhat
mistaken
arthur
had
not
yet
breathed
a
word
of
love
to
his
young
patient
and
she
thought
of
him
only
as
her
dear
kind
doctor
who
had
done
much
to
relieve
her
sufferings
and
had
in
all
probability
saved
her
life
she
had
strong
confidence
in
his
skill
and
was
a
perfectly
tractable
and
obedient
patient
he
assisted
her
to
her
room
that
evening
as
usual
more
than
an
hour
before
any
but
the
younger
children
were
ready
to
retire
it
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
evening
and
the
porches
where
most
of
the
family
were
gathered
looked
very
inviting
as
he
came
down
again
and
stepped
out
upon
the
one
that
ran
along
the
front
of
the
house
his
cousin
elsie
invited
him
to
an
by
her
side
then
presently
proposed
that
they
two
should
stroll
around
the
porches
together
he
caught
gladly
at
the
suggestion
rose
and
offered
her
his
arm
i
want
a
little
private
chat
with
you
art
she
said
smiling
brightly
up
into
his
face
i
am
always
glad
to
talk
with
you
cousin
he
returned
giving
her
an
affectionate
yet
keenly
scrutinizing
look
but
i
hope
it
is
not
of
any
serious
ailment
you
have
to
tell
oh
no
i
am
thankful
to
be
able
to
say
that
i
and
all
my
near
and
dear
ones
are
in
perfect
health
so
far
as
i
know
it
is
of
yourself
and
your
dear
young
patient
i
would
speak
marian
is
a
sweet
girl
lovely
in
both
character
and
so
i
think
ah
cousin
if
i
were
only
some
years
younger
never
mind
that
art
you
are
young
in
looks
and
feeling
and
i
doubt
if
there
is
any
one
nearer
and
dearer
to
her
now
than
yourself
she
thinks
her
feeling
for
you
is
only
the
gratitude
and
affection
any
patient
might
feel
for
a
kind
attentive
sympathizing
physician
but
i
am
much
mistaken
if
on
hearing
the
story
of
your
love
from
your
lips
she
will
fail
to
discover
that
she
loves
you
as
a
woman
should
the
man
to
whom
she
gives
her
do
you
really
think
so
cousin
he
asked
with
a
bright
glad
smile
i
do
indeed
she
replied
and
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
soon
put
it
to
the
proof
by
offering
her
my
hand
and
he
seemed
lost
in
thought
for
a
moment
then
heaving
a
sigh
ah
if
i
were
only
sure
he
sure
of
not
by
so
doing
losing
the
place
i
can
see
that
i
have
already
won
in
her
may
not
after
all
be
anything
more
than
should
not
for
a
moment
hesitate
to
make
the
offer
you
recommend
for
i
feel
confident
that
with
mutual
love
we
might
be
exceptionally
happy
despite
the
difference
in
our
no
doubt
of
it
she
returned
and
i
hope
that
before
you
leave
us
you
will
put
it
to
the
proof
because
i
think
it
will
be
for
both
your
happiness
and
thank
you
very
much
for
both
your
sympathy
and
advice
dear
cousin
he
said
i
shall
do
so
if
opportunity
offers
as
is
likely
to
be
the
case
seeing
we
are
so
frequently
alone
together
as
patient
and
physician
then
if
i
find
she
does
not
and
can
not
love
me
in
the
way
i
wish
i
shall
trouble
her
no
longer
with
my
presence
but
speedily
set
off
for
home
and
its
but
even
in
that
case
you
need
not
entirely
despair
his
cousin
said
with
a
bright
sweet
look
up
into
his
rather
anxious
and
troubled
face
for
she
is
but
young
and
clever
courting
may
win
her
heart
in
time
you
are
such
a
dear
fellow
art
so
generous
sympathetic
so
unselfish
and
helpful
that
you
seem
to
me
to
deserve
every
good
thing
in
oh
cousin
elsie
such
extravagant
praise
mortifies
me
because
i
must
acknowledge
to
myself
that
it
is
so
far
beyond
my
deserts
he
returned
blushing
like
a
girl
it
need
not
she
said
there
is
an
old
saying
that
every
deserving
one
at
white
bread
at
some
time
in
his
or
her
life
you
have
had
a
hard
life
so
far
but
i
hope
your
time
for
white
bread
is
now
close
at
he
laughed
a
little
at
that
yes
he
said
cal
and
i
have
worked
very
hard
for
years
past
and
times
do
grow
easier
with
us
but
whether
i
shall
ever
get
so
far
with
the
white
bread
as
to
win
the
dear
young
wife
i
covet
i
do
not
well
you
have
my
best
wishes
she
returned
and
i
shall
do
what
i
can
to
help
the
prosperity
of
your
suit
by
sounding
your
praises
in
the
ears
of
your
ah
do
not
look
alarmed
but
trust
me
to
say
only
enough
to
interest
her
not
so
much
as
to
weary
her
of
the
thank
you
dear
cousin
i
know
i
can
trust
you
fully
and
will
you
not
help
me
with
your
prayers
that
i
may
if
it
be
god
s
will
succeed
in
winning
her
heart
completely
surely
i
will
she
said
and
i
believe
our
joint
petition
will
be
granted
if
it
be
for
the
arthur
lay
awake
for
some
time
that
night
pondering
on
elsie
s
advice
in
regard
to
his
contemplated
suit
for
marian
s
hand
and
asking
divine
guidance
and
help
the
next
morning
soon
after
breakfast
he
as
usual
asked
marian
if
she
would
like
to
go
down
on
the
beach
and
get
a
breath
of
the
refreshing
breeze
from
the
sea
yes
indeed
doctor
if
it
will
not
be
keeping
you
from
going
somewhere
with
somebody
else
she
answered
with
a
smile
not
at
all
he
returned
i
have
no
engagement
and
shall
be
glad
not
only
to
help
you
to
a
breath
of
but
to
take
one
he
brought
a
light
shawl
and
wrapped
it
about
her
saying
the
breeze
was
rather
fresh
for
her
while
her
cousin
elsie
tied
on
her
hat
and
veil
then
with
a
thick
shawl
over
one
arm
he
offered
her
the
other
saying
walter
has
run
on
ahead
with
a
couple
of
for
us
and
this
heavier
shawl
is
to
wrap
around
you
in
case
you
find
the
other
not
warm
thank
you
she
returned
smiling
up
into
his
face
i
am
sure
it
is
not
every
patient
who
has
so
good
and
kind
a
doctor
as
i
do
certainly
want
to
be
kind
to
all
my
patients
he
said
pleasantly
yet
can
not
deny
that
some
are
greater
favorites
with
me
than
others
besides
i
have
you
know
but
the
one
here
to
devote
myself
fortunately
for
me
she
returned
laughingly
and
i
assure
you
i
do
enjoy
having
my
doctor
all
to
myself
one
likes
to
be
treated
as
a
person
of
importance
you
you
are
such
to
me
he
said
especially
as
you
have
not
yet
fully
recovered
your
strength
and
i
must
leave
you
soon
to
return
to
the
care
of
other
patients
left
behind
in
the
she
started
and
looked
up
into
his
face
but
said
nothing
for
at
that
moment
walter
came
running
up
to
them
cousin
arthur
he
said
i
placed
the
stools
about
where
you
usually
sit
i
think
but
if
they
are
not
just
where
you
want
them
they
are
easily
yes
thank
you
replied
the
doctor
and
walter
ran
on
to
the
house
he
seated
marian
comfortably
then
took
the
chair
beside
her
must
you
go
very
soon
she
asked
trying
to
swallow
a
lump
in
her
throat
i
am
afraid
i
must
on
account
of
the
other
patients
though
it
seems
decidedly
hard
for
me
to
leave
this
delightful
spot
and
pleasant
yes
sir
and
i
really
think
you
ought
to
have
a
longer
rest
after
working
so
hard
and
long
am
afraid
i
have
been
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
the
cause
of
much
weariness
i
can
never
begin
to
pay
you
for
it
o
marian
dear
girl
you
can
far
more
than
repay
me
only
you
can
find
it
in
your
heart
to
love
and
trust
me
well
enough
to
give
your
dear
self
into
my
care
for
the
rest
of
our
two
lives
he
said
in
low
eager
tones
bending
over
her
and
taking
her
hand
in
his
she
did
not
withdraw
it
but
neither
did
she
speak
but
bending
low
to
catch
sight
of
her
face
he
saw
that
her
tears
were
falling
fast
o
my
darling
i
did
not
mean
to
distress
you
so
he
said
in
moved
tones
i
see
that
you
can
not
give
me
that
kind
of
love
so
forget
that
i
have
asked
forget
she
exclaimed
in
low
tremulous
tones
forget
the
sweetest
words
i
ever
had
spoken
to
me
oh
no
no
but
i
don
t
know
how
you
can
give
such
love
to
poor
ignorant
girl
whose
own
father
cares
so
little
for
her
that
he
would
sacrifice
her
happiness
for
no
no
he
said
gathering
her
in
his
arms
the
sweetest
dearest
loveliest
one
that
ever
crossed
my
path
and
you
can
love
me
ah
darling
you
have
made
me
the
happiest
of
men
you
do
not
deny
that
you
love
me
and
you
are
to
me
the
dearest
of
all
earthly
he
held
her
close
while
she
dropped
her
head
on
his
breast
and
wept
for
very
joy
and
thankfulness
for
elsie
was
right
he
had
won
her
heart
and
was
dearer
to
her
than
all
the
world
besides
many
comforting
endearing
words
fell
from
his
lips
as
he
held
her
close
in
such
loving
embrace
as
she
had
not
felt
since
her
mother
s
death
till
at
length
her
tears
ceased
to
fall
and
she
was
able
to
speak
again
oh
i
never
dreamed
she
said
that
one
so
wise
and
good
could
ever
care
in
that
way
for
me
my
heart
is
so
full
of
joy
and
gratitude
to
god
and
to
you
that
words
would
not
express
the
half
of
it
but
are
you
not
afraid
that
you
may
some
day
weary
of
a
companion
for
life
who
knows
so
much
less
than
you
do
that
she
is
but
a
child
in
comparison
with
you
ah
no
he
answered
with
a
smile
i
have
only
feared
that
your
youth
and
my
years
might
stand
in
the
way
of
my
winning
you
that
a
girl
so
sweet
fresh
and
young
would
feel
herself
thrown
away
upon
a
man
of
my
age
it
would
be
but
natural
that
you
should
prefer
a
much
more
youthful
and
i
do
not
know
where
i
could
find
a
one
she
answered
with
an
earnest
sincerity
that
made
him
smile
your
face
is
so
benevolent
in
expression
so
full
of
goodness
and
kindness
that
i
could
not
help
loving
and
trusting
you
from
the
ah
darling
those
are
sweet
words
he
said
his
eyes
shining
and
you
i
found
so
patient
and
uncomplaining
under
suffering
so
grateful
for
any
and
every
kindness
done
you
every
effort
to
give
you
relief
that
i
could
but
admire
and
end
by
loving
you
as
i
never
loved
before
ah
dearest
that
you
return
my
love
and
have
given
yourself
to
me
has
made
me
the
happiest
of
men
what
a
joy
it
will
be
to
have
you
for
my
very
own
to
love

of

with

papers
or
magazines
in
their
hands
elsie
looked
smilingly
at
arthur
and
marian
as
they
came
up
the
steps
something
in
their
faces
telling
what
had
passed
between
them
since
they
walked
down
to
the
beach
together
arthur
saw
and
returned
her
smile
and
leading
marian
to
her
said
in
joyous
tones
you

cousin
i
followed
your
advice
and
she

has
given
herself

me
or
rather
we
have
given
ourselves
to
each
his
clear
though
not
loud
tones
reached
every
ear
and
in
a
moment
all
the
relatives

and
young
had
gathered
about
the
happy
pair
with
their
hearty
congratulations

sweet
a
new

mary
said
giving
the
young
girl
a
warm
embrace
and
hugh
and
i
are
to
be
left
desolate
and
alone
remarked
lilburn
in
a
rueful
tone
hugh

i
shall
have
to
try
father
returned
the
young
man
coloring
and
laughing
i
contemplate
robbing
those
who
have
robbed
us
but
a
fair
exchange
is
no
at
that
both
the
conlys
turned
surprised
inquiring
looks
upon

there
was
a
murmur
of
surprise
from
the
listeners
accompanied
by
looks
of
pleasure
then
the
brothers
shook
hands
with
hugh
wishing
him
joy
and
saying
they
should
be
glad
to
receive
him
into
the
family
my
what
a
lot
of
weddings

to
be
going
to
have
exclaimed
rosie
i
think
i
ll
wait
for

till

are
not
quite
such
common
particularly
as
there
s
nobody
offering
to
pair
off
with
you
yet
my
pretty
young
sister
laughed
walter
i
think
though
that

the
best
place
for
you
and
me
for
a
while
ah
marian
here
is
a
letter
for
you
my
bonny
lass
from
your
brother

out
to
her
she
took
it
eagerly
exclaiming

joyous
tones

kind
offer

soon
as

about
a
couple
of
in
the
mean
time
arthur
had
opened
and
read
a
letter
handed
him
by
his
brother
he
looked
much
pleased
with
its
contents
cousin
elsie
he
said

think

accommodate

few
days
longer

quite
certain
of
it
provided

she
answered
with
her
own
bright
sweet
smile
you
need
not
have
the
slightest
fear
that
you
are
not
as
welcome
as
the
thank
you
very
much
he
said

walter
but

hope

expected

arthur
gravely
you

t
trouble
yourself
trying
to
make
business

walter
giving
her
a
mischievous
look
which
brought
a
charming
blush
to
her
cheek
yes
walter
i
have
given
him
a
great
deal
of
business
in
that
line
i
am
sorry
to
say
she
returned
so
that
he
has
had
but
little
rest
and
needs
to
stay
and
have
some
so
he
has
but
you

much
better
i
m
sure
for
your
cheeks

like
as
the
white
kind
we
ll
all
endeavor
to

so
that

ll
have
nothing
to
do
but
rest
and
recruit
the
remainder
of
the
time
he
well
what
are
the
plans
for
the
day
asked
harold
addressing
the
company
in
general

of
us
want
to
do
a
little
shopping
and
would
like
to
have
you

to
the
city

his
mother
i

do
so
with
the
greatest
pleasure
mamma
he
returned
how
soon
do
you
wish

rosie
i

some
time

actually
hungry

ll

done

your
hunger
said
herbert
gallantly

others
of
our
company
suffering
from
the
same
kind
of
hunger
yes
i
d
like
to

said
lulu

papa
yes
if

right
kind
of

i
can
feel
that
you

be
safe
violet
my
dear
if

not
to
be
one
of
the
shopping
party
will
you
ride
with
me
and
the
others
with
pleasure
my
dear
she
replied
i
dare
say
i
am
as
hungry
for
a
ride
as
my
younger
sister
and
in
your
company
it
will
be
especially
all
then
hurried
to
their
rooms
to
don
their
riding
hats
and
habits
while
harold
and
the
captain
went
in
search
of
the
required
steeds
arthur
did
not
think
marian
strong
enough
for
such
a
ride
and
mary
and
calhoun
did
not
care
to
go
they
would
probably
walk
out
presently
but
just
now
were
waiting
to
see
the
others
off
at
calhoun
s
request
mary
sat
down
to
the
piano
marian
and
arthur
drew
near
and
the
four
joined
in
the
singing
of
some
of
their
favorite
hymns
mary
playing
the
accompaniment
presently
will
croly
ran
in
in
his
informal
way
joined
the
little
group
and
added
his
voice
to
theirs
were
exchanged
when
they
had
finished
their
piece
then
croly
said
now
miss
mary
let
us
have
my
days
are
gliding
swiftly
it
is
a
great
favorite
with
me
particularly
the
chorus
for
oh
we
stand
on
jordan
s
strand
our
friends
are
passing
over
and
just
before
the
shining
shore
we
may
almost
mary
at
once
complied
with
the
request
and
they
were
singing
the
last
verse
when
two
young
men
strangers
to
the
family
came
up
into
the
porch
asking
for
croly
ah
said
he
i
quite
forgot
my
errand
those
are
some
strangers
visiting
at
my
uncle
s
house
and
i
have
promised
to
go
in
bathing
with
called
to
ask
my
friends
harold
and
herbert
to
go
in
with
i
really
don
t
think
they
can
said
calhoun
and
went
on
to
explain
how
they
had
planned
to
spend
the
next
few
hours
ah
then
i
must
just
go
on
with
the
others
returned
croly
to
you
all
and
with
the
words
he
hurried
out
joined
the
two
strangers
the
three
went
over
to
the
bath
houses
not
very
far
away
and
were
presently
seen
coming
out
of
them
in
and
going
down
among
the
waves
a
few
moments
later
those
who
had
gone
in
search
of
horses
and
carriage
returned
bringing
a
full
supply
those
expecting
to
go
had
crowded
on
the
porch
all
in
good
spirits
laughing
and
chatting
the
younger
ones
especially
full
of
mirth
and
gayety
when
suddenly
a
cry
of
fright
and
distress
came
from
the
sea
help
help
he
s
drowning
oh
help
help
save
him
with
the
first
cry
a
deep
hush
had
fallen
on
our
friends
upon
the
porch
but
at
the
last
word
captain
raymond
dinsmore
lilburn
and
his
son
the
two
conlys
harold
and
herbert
all
dashed
down
the
steps
and
away
toward
the
spot
from
whence
the
cry
came
but
a
near
at
hand
was
already
pulling
for
it
and
was
there
before
them
there
seemed
nothing
for
them
to
do
but
they
stood
close
by
the
incoming
waves
waiting
in
breathless
anxiety
and
suspense
some
moments
they
saw
an
insensible
limp
dripping
form
drawn
from
the
water
into
the
boat
which
immediately
made
for
the
shore
with
all
speed
oh
it
is
will
dear
will
cried
harold
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
face
o
art
cousin
art
do
your
best
to
save
him
if
there
s
any
life
there
how
glad
i
am
you
re
here
with
i
shall
certainly
do
all
i
can
returned
arthur
in
moved
tones
and
do
the
rest
of
you
ask
the
lord
to
direct
and
bless
my
oh
yes
we
will
we
will
responded
several
voices
as
the
poor
fellow
was
lifted
from
the
boat
and
swiftly
carried
to
the
nearest
one
occupied
by
our
friends
arthur
understood
his
business
thoroughly
and
there
were
plenty
of
willing
helping
hands
the
news
flew
fast
and
presently
croly
s
aunt
came
full
of
distress
to
ask
if
there
was
any
life
any
hope
we
have
not
given
up
we
will
not
while
the
least
spark
of
hope
remains
elsie
answered
then
told
of
the
long
and
at
last
successful
fight
which
had
once
saved
her
harold
from
the
grave
oh
dear
fellow
i
hope
he
will
be
saved
said
the
aunt
weeping
you
probably
know
travilla
how
anxious
he
has
been
about
his
parents
we
have
just
had
a
telegram
from
his
father
saying
that
they
have
landed
in
new
york
and
will
be
here
this
evening
i
think
it
will
kill
his
too
perhaps
for
he
is
their
only
child
and
just
an
idol
with
them
learn
that
he
is
lying
here
to
all
appearance
dead
i
ll
have
to
put
them
off
with
the
news
that
he
went
out
on
the
sea
before
their
telegram
came
and
may
be
back
in
an
hour
or
yes
i
hope
he
will
soon
show
signs
of
life
elsie
said
with
emotion
oh
how
sad
how
for
them
to
lose
their
only
child
in
such
a
suddenly
and
without
a
parting
word
they
are
coming
home
very
happy
continued
the
aunt
the
mother
having
almost
entirely
recovered
her
health
and
if
only
they
could
find
poor
will
all
she
ended
with
a
burst
of
weeping
dear
croly
do
not
give
up
hope
we
are
all
praying
for
his
life
may
be
spared
if
the
will
of
god
be
then
i
believe
it
will
be
for
god
is
the
hearer
and
answerer
of
prayer
returned
the
aunt
and
oh
i
want
to
thank
you
for
having
poor
will
brought
here
for
if
he
was
with
us
the
state
of
affairs
could
hardly
be
kept
a
moment
from
his
parents
but
now
i
hope
it
will
be
all
right
before
they
need
to
you
are
very
very
welcome
elsie
replied
and
croly
went
away
somewhat
consoled
and
hopeful
the
rides
and
the
shopping
expedition
had
been
given
up
and
the
children
and
younger
members
of
the
family
had
gone
down
to
the
beach
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
those
working
with
croly
but
rosie
lulu
grace
and
walter
were
in
a
sad
subdued
and
anxious
mood
mary
and
marian
presently
joined
them
and
they
talked
feelingly
of
him
whom
they
hardly
dared
to
hope
to
see
in
life
again
yet
all
had
great
faith
in
arthur
s
skill
and
the
younger
girls
telling
of
harold
s
narrow
escape
some
years
before
at
nantucket
cheered
and
encouraged
the
others
with
the
hope
that
croly
might
even
yet
be
saved
from
temporal
death
and
live
many
years
to
be
a
comfort
to
his
parents
and
a
blessing
to
the
world
i
do
hope
he
is
not
gone
and
will
live
for
many
years
serving
the
master
here
on
earth
said
mary
but
if
he
is
gone
we
know
that
it
is
to
be
with
jesus
and
forever
blest
how
he
loved
that
hymn
about
the
shining
shore
and
perhaps
he
has
reached
it
now
she
added
with
a
burst
of
tears
but
oh
we
will
hope
not
hope
he
is
still
living
and
will
be
spared
to
the
parents
who
love
him
so
dearly
said
marian
and
i
believe
if
anybody
can
save
him
it
is
your
cousin
i
ll
run
back
to
the
house
to
see
if
there
is
any
sign
of
life
yet
said
walter
and
rushed
away
he
was
back
again
in
a
few
minutes
running
waving
his
handkerchief
over
his
head
and
showing
so
joyous
a
face
that
the
others
exclaimed
half
breathlessly
oh
is
he
coming
to
yes
yes
cousin
arthur
says
there
are
signs
of
life
and
he
thinks
that
he
will
be
able
to
save
the
glad
news
was
received
with
a
simultaneous
burst
of
joyful
exclamations
his
parents
have
come
added
walter
and
are
oh
so
anxious
to
see
him
but
don
t
know
yet
that
anything
is
wrong
with
and
now
with
their
minds
relieved
the
girls
were
able
to
give
attention
to
anything
that
might
be
going
on
within
the
range
of
their
vision
a
boat
was
tied
to
the
wharf
and
they
saw
that
persons
had
left
it
and
were
wandering
along
the
beach
among
them
an
elderly
man
having
several
children
in
his
care
presently
this
little
group
had
seated
themselves
on
the
beach
quite
near
our
little
party
and
the
smallest
a
child
of
three
came
toddling
toward
them
how
do
you
do
baby
girl
do
you
like
candy
will
you
have
a
bite
asked
rosie
holding
out
a
morsel
the
little
one
stood
gazing
for
a
moment
with
her
finger
in
her
mouth
then
she
accepted
the
offer
dood
she
said
smacking
her
lips
dot
nudder
bit
for
sally
yes
rosie
said
bestowing
another
piece
but
another
older
girl
came
running
sally
she
said
reprovingly
and
seizing
the
little
one
s
hand
in
an
effort
to
draw
her
away
you
must
not
tease
the
ladies
papa
says
so
come
with
sally
resisted
and
rosie
said
no
we
are
not
teased
we
d
like
to
have
her
stay
and
talk
to
but
the
father
had
come
for
his
baby
girl
please
excuse
her
young
ladies
he
said
lifting
his
hat
politely
she
s
pretty
well
spoiled
i
ve
come
to
the
seaside
for
a
bit
of
rest
and
brought
my
children
along
for
i
knew
it
would
be
quite
a
treat
to
and
see
we
ve
all
got
on
the
union
colors
said
one
of
the
little
girls
who
had
followed
him
showing
a
rosette
of
red
white
and
blue
ribbon
pinned
to
her
dress
father
was
a
soldier
in
the
war
and
we
all
love
the
old
oh
were
you
sir
cried
lulu
delightedly
won
t
you
please
tell
us
of
your
experiences
there
the
other
girls
joined
eagerly
in
the
request
and
at
length
evidently
pleased
that
they
cared
to
hear
the
story
he
sat
down
on
the
beach
beside
them
and
began
it
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
i
was
in
the
shenandoah
valley
with
the
infantry
troops
a
mere
lad
i
was
only
fifteen
one
day
i
slipped
off
without
leave
to
visit
an
aunt
living
in
washington
we
were
at
that
time
in
camp
on
georgetown
heights
going
back
that
night
i
lost
my
way
and
did
not
feel
safe
to
ask
it
lest
i
should
be
thought
a
deserter
so
finally
went
down
into
an
area
and
wearied
out
with
my
wanderings
fell
asleep
it
rained
heavily
through
the
night
but
i
was
so
weary
and
so
used
to
hardship
that
i
slept
on
and
knew
nothing
about
that
till
morning
when
i
waked
to
find
myself
lying
in
a
puddle
of
water
i
rose
and
hurried
on
my
way
finally
got
back
to
camp
but
so
rheumatic
from
my
wetting
that
i
was
sent
to
the
washington
there
my
gun
was
taken
from
me
and
a
receipt
for
it
given
me
so
that
when
at
length
i
recovered
sufficiently
to
go
back
to
camp
i
was
without
a
gun
it
was
not
supplied
to
me
immediately
and
in
the
mean
time
the
troops
with
whom
i
belonged
were
ordered
to
guard
some
very
long
while
it
was
moving
on
mosby
came
up
with
his
cavalry
took
us
prisoners
rifled
the
wagons
of
such
things
as
he
could
carry
away
and
use
and
took
the
best
horses
for
the
use
of
his
troops
leaving
behind
his
own
ones
mosby
s
own
troops
and
his
prisoners
were
allowed
to
help
themselves
to
such
provisions
as
they
could
carry
i
think
they
burnt
all
they
could
not
take
when
the
rebs
came
upon
us
one
demanded
my
coat
i
pulled
it
off
and
gave
it
to
him
another
took
my
hat
a
third
my
shoes
so
that
i
was
not
particularly
well
dressed
when
they
were
done
with
me
but
i
as
well
as
others
filled
my
haversack
with
pork
and
so
as
they
moved
on
each
prisoner
was
obliged
to
lead
one
or
more
horses
i
had
but
one
when
the
troops
halted
for
the
night
the
ordered
to
take
the
horses
to
the
river
and
water
them
i
had
been
all
the
time
since
my
capture
trying
to
contrive
a
way
to
escape
now
i
saw
a
way
told
a
my
plan
and
asked
him
to
render
his
aid
by
taking
charge
of
my
horse
in
addition
to
several
already
in
his
keeping
he
consented
i
slipped
from
the
horse
s
back
and
unobserved
got
behind
a
large
stone
allowed
myself
to
sink
in
the
water
there
till
nearly
able
to
so
remained
till
the
troops
of
rebs
and
prisoners
had
left
the
spot
then
creeping
cautiously
out
i
hurried
on
my
way
going
down
the
river
bank
knowing
the
union
troops
were
camped
somewhere
lower
down
the
stream
i
trudged
on
all
night
crept
into
the
bushes
and
hid
as
day
there
all
day
tortured
with
heat
and
thirst
as
well
as
on
again
the
following
night
faint
weary
and
worn
with
fatigue
hunger
and
thirst
about
nine
o
clock
seeing
a
light
at
a
little
distance
i
went
toward
it
feeling
that
i
must
venture
for
relief
from
my
intolerable
sufferings
from
hunger
and
thirst
as
i
drew
near
the
light
a
dog
began
to
bark
from
its
vicinity
and
rushed
out
in
my
direction
at
that
i
stood
still
and
the
dog
came
no
nearer
but
presently
i
heard
the
voice
of
a
negro
man
asking
who
dar
knowing
the
negroes
were
always
friends
to
the
union
soldiers
i
then
came
forward
and
told
of
my
escape
from
the
rebs
and
my
desire
to
reach
the
union
camp
my
ignorance
of
the
right
road
hunger
thirst
and
weariness
the
negro
told
me
i
was
in
a
dangerous
troops
being
all
he
and
not
much
provision
but
to
come
in
and
dinah
would
give
me
something
to
eat
then
i
could
go
on
my
way
he
showing
me
where
to
ford
the
river
the
federal
troops
being
two
or
three
miles
farther
down
on
the
other
side
i
went
with
him
into
the
cabin
an
old
negress
greeted
me
kindly
and
having
heard
my
story
undertook
to
get
me
some
supper
she
made
a
corn
pone
took
a
pan
with
a
division
across
the
middle
put
the
pone
in
one
side
some
bacon
in
the
other
and
setting
it
on
the
coals
cooked
them
together
the
fat
from
the
bacon
running
through
to
the
pone
it
made
as
delicious
a
supper
as
i
ever
ate
she
gave
me
a
piece
to
carry
along
when
i
set
out
upon
my
journey
again
as
i
did
presently
travelling
still
farther
down
stream
till
i
reached
a
ford
near
there
i
lay
down
and
slept
soundly
not
waking
till
the
sun
was
two
hours
high
i
was
alarmed
to
find
it
so
late
but
i
forded
the
river
safely
and
finally
reached
the
union
camp
no
one
there
knew
me
i
had
not
even
a
uniform
to
show
what
i
was
so
lest
i
might
prove
to
be
a
spy
i
was
ordered
under
arrest
and
confined
till
some
of
my
own
regiment
who
knew
me
came
in
and
corroborated
my
story
or
at
least
recognized
me
as
one
of
that
was
a
very
interesting
story
and
we
are
much
obliged
to
you
for
it
sir
said
lulu
as
the
narrator
paused
as
if
he
had
finished
but
can
t
you
give
us
another
yes
he
said
smiling
in
an
way
i
was
just
thinking
of
another
and
rather
amusing
occurrence
that
took
place
while
i
was
a
soldier
though
it
hadn
t
much
to
do
with
the
war
my
parents
were
living
in
baltimore
then
and
i
was
still
in
the
shenandoah
valley
at
one
time
blackberries
being
very
plenty
in
the
woods
where
i
was
encamped
i
gathered
great
quantities
filled
a
box
putting
green
leaves
under
and
over
the
berries
nailed
it
up
and
sent
it
by
express
to
my
parents
i
wrote
to
them
about
it
but
the
box
started
ahead
of
the
letter
and
arrived
first
in
the
mean
time
my
mother
and
grandmother
had
been
talking
of
paying
a
visit
to
my
older
sister
who
had
married
was
living
in
philadelphia
and
anxious
and
urgent
to
have
them
come
on
to
see
her
and
her
baby
boy
toddling
about
they
were
most
desirous
to
do
so
as
he
was
the
first
grandchild
of
the
one
the
first
of
the
other
but
before
they
had
made
ready
to
start
upon
the
journey
a
letter
was
received
from
the
child
s
mother
saying
that
he
had
been
taken
dangerously
ill
the
two
grandmothers
were
greatly
troubled
and
more
anxious
than
ever
to
see
the
baby
the
older
one
was
in
her
bedroom
not
feeling
well
her
daughter
was
with
her
a
vehicle
was
heard
to
drive
up
to
the
front
door
glancing
from
the
window
the
younger
grandmother
saw
it
was
the
express
wagon
and
a
box
was
being
lifted
out
evidently
for
them
mother
having
said
they
should
see
it
dead
or
contained
the
corpse
of
her
baby
grandchild
she
hurried
down
had
it
carried
into
the
parlor
and
set
upon
a
table
she
then
threw
a
white
sheet
over
it
and
awaited
in
trembling
and
grief
the
of
her
father
when
he
came
in
she
told
of
the
box
and
its
supposed
contents
and
he
also
full
of
grief
set
to
work
to
open
it
the
lid
was
at
length
torn
off
and
great
was
the
surprise
and
relief
of
both
to
come
upon
the
fresh
green
leaves
and
berries
beneath
them
but
the
rang
again
and
there
stood
hannah
with
her
babe
in
her
arms
alive
and
well
joyful
was
the
welcome
given
to
both
they
were
taken
into
the
parlor
hannah
shown
the
box
which
was
still
standing
and
told
the
story
after
a
while
the
baby
was
allowed
to
trot
about
at
his
own
sweet
will
while
the
older
people
were
taken
up
with
each
other
a
cradle
had
been
brought
down
to
the
parlor
to
lay
the
baby
corpse
in
before
the
box
was
opened
and
there
it
stood
covered
with
a
spread
or
something
white
so
when
the
little
chap
was
left
unnoticed
he
got
at
the
box
of
berries
carried
some
to
the
cradle
and
threw
them
in
on
the
dainty
white
the
little
girls
had
been
listening
to
their
father
s
story
with
as
much
interest
as
if
they
had
never
heard
it
before
though
doubtless
it
was
quite
familiar
to
them
wasn
t
it
funny
asked
one
of
them
with
a
merry
laugh
as
he
finished
but
just
then
a
boy
came
running
calling
out
pap
you
re
wanted
now
please
come
right
away
mother
says
and
with
a
pleasant
ladies
the
father
rose
took
sally
in
his
arms
and
went
the
rest
of
the
children
following
chapter
xviii
the
old
soldier
and
his
children
had
hardly
left
the
vicinity
of
our
young
friends
when
calhoun
came
to
them
with
the
glad
news
that
croly
had
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
speak
naturally
and
recognize
his
friends
that
his
parents
had
been
told
of
his
danger
and
his
rescue
and
were
now
with
him
weeping
over
his
sufferings
rejoicing
that
he
had
been
spared
to
them
and
full
of
gratitude
to
conly
for
his
and
untiring
efforts
for
his
resuscitation
i
am
proud
of
my
brother
and
don
t
believe
there
is
a
better
physician
in
the
united
states
concluded
calhoun
his
eyes
shining
but
ladies
and
little
folks
i
just
remember
that
cousin
elsie
charged
me
to
tell
you
that
dinner
will
be
on
the
table
in
about
ten
or
fifteen
oh
that
s
good
news
cousin
cal
exclaimed
rosie
for
i
m
pow
ful
hungry
as
the
darkies
say
there
s
nothing
like
to
give
one
an
and
with
that
they
all
started
for
the
house
arthur
was
longing
to
be
with
marian
but
at
the
urgent
request
of
the
elder
croly
and
his
wife
consented
to
stay
with
their
son
who
had
been
carried
to
his
uncle
s
cottage
through
the
rest
of
that
day
and
the
following
night
then
assuring
them
that
will
had
almost
entirely
recovered
and
there
was
no
longer
the
slightest
need
of
his
services
he
was
beginning
to
bid
them
when
croly
laying
a
detaining
hand
on
his
arm
poured
out
earnest
thanks
for
the
service
he
had
done
them
in
saving
the
life
of
their
only
and
son
and
delicately
asked
what
was
his
charge
for
his
services
hinting
that
both
he
and
his
wife
thought
it
should
be
a
heavy
one
oh
no
sir
said
arthur
i
make
no
charge
whatever
for
so
trifling
a
service
to
one
whom
i
had
learned
to
love
almost
as
a
brother
i
am
more
than
repaid
by
his
spared
blessing
of
god
upon
my
efforts
and
with
a
pleasant
he
hurried
away
he
met
the
family
at
the
breakfast
table
and
was
received
with
joyful
greetings
an
hour
later
he
and
marian
sought
the
beach
together
it
seemed
a
long
time
that
they
had
been
kept
apart
and
they
greatly
enjoyed
being
again
alone
together
for
a
time
when
the
mail
was
brought
to
the
house
walter
as
usual
came
running
down
to
them
with
their
letter
for
marian
and
several
for
the
doctor
glancing
at
his
he
noticed
that
one
was
without
a
postmark
and
somewhat
curious
to
know
whence
it
came
he
opened
that
envelope
first
it
proved
to
be
from
the
elder
croly
and
contained
a
note
and
another
paper
arthur
opened
and
read
the
note
first
in
it
the
writer
stated
that
he
felt
that
he
owed
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
the
spared
life
of
his
only
and
child
which
he
could
never
by
any
possibility
repay
and
that
the
doctor
who
had
been
instrumental
in
saving
that
life
would
confer
a
favor
by
accepting
the
inclosed
certificate
of
stock
as
a
small
token
of
the
grateful
affection
of
will
croly
s
parents
and
of
the
dear
boy
himself
who
would
be
delighted
to
have
him
do
so
and
feel
that
it
was
far
from
being
an
adequate
return
for
the
inestimable
service
rendered
the
writer
added
that
they
would
all
feel
sadly
hurt
should
he
refuse
all
this
arthur
read
with
a
pleasant
glow
of
feeling
they
are
far
more
grateful
than
most
people
he
said
to
himself
as
he
opened
the
accompanying
paper
can
i
believe
my
eyes
he
exclaimed
mentally
as
he
hastily
glanced
over
it
then
gave
it
a
more
careful
examination
the
certificate
was
for
stock
to
the
amount
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
yielding
six
per
cent
there
could
be
no
mistake
and
he
felt
that
he
had
suddenly
become
a
rich
man
but
at
that
instant
a
low
sob
from
marian
caught
his
ear
and
instantly
everything
was
forgotten
but
that
she
was
in
trouble
my
darling
what
is
it
he
asked
putting
an
arm
about
her
and
drawing
her
closer
to
him
oh
i
am
so
frightened
she
said
with
quivering
lips
read
this
letter
from
he
did
so
at
once
the
boy
wrote
warning
marian
that
their
father
had
in
some
way
learned
that
captain
raymond
had
shown
himself
a
friend
to
her
so
suspected
that
she
had
gone
to
him
for
protection
had
found
out
the
captain
s
address
and
started
east
with
the
probable
intention
of
hunting
her
up
and
carrying
her
back
to
utah
with
him
oh
what
can
i
do
can
you
protect
me
from
him
asked
marian
as
conly
refolded
the
letter
and
drew
her
closer
into
his
arms
he
shall
never
take
you
from
me
he
returned
in
determined
tones
and
holding
her
close
to
his
heart
i
think
the
surest
thing
will
be
for
us
to
marry
at
once
if
you
are
willing
o
my
darling
you
are
not
afraid
to
trust
me
no
no
indeed
she
exclaimed
adding
if
you
are
willing
to
take
me
just
as
i
am
only
half
educated
more
much
more
than
willing
he
replied
but
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
let
us
go
up
at
once
to
the
house
and
consult
with
the
friends
yes
especially
cousin
elsie
and
my
best
and
kindest
of
friends
dear
old
cousin
they
were
glad
to
find
all
the
family
in
and
quickly
told
them
their
story
arthur
concluding
with
i
think
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
marry
at
once
so
that
i
shall
have
a
prior
right
to
that
of
mcalpine
and
can
prevent
him
from
carrying
her
away
from
i
agree
with
you
sir
said
lilburn
and
should
think
it
well
for
you
to
carry
her
away
to
some
place
unknown
to
the
unnatural
man
till
he
wearies
of
his
search
and
goes
back
to
then
if
the
plan
is
approved
by
my
wife
and
others
i
will
go
at
once
for
the
and
we
will
sail
or
steam
away
with
the
bride
and
groom
said
the
captain
we
can
visit
mount
desert
and
whatever
other
points
we
please
along
the
whole
coast
between
this
and
our
city
making
occasional
calls
here
if
we
like
and
go
home
when
we
wish
and
are
satisfied
that
the
danger
there
is
oh
by
all
means
let
us
go
said
violet
nothing
could
be
more
and
herbert
and
i
will
drive
in
at
once
for
a
minister
to
perform
the
ceremony
said
harold
taking
up
his
hat
have
you
any
choice
marian
i
know
none
of
them
but
the
one
to
whose
preaching
the
rest
of
you
have
been
listening
and
who
kindly
called
to
see
me
the
other
day
she
replied
with
a
blush
then
we
will
go
for
him
returned
harold
but
stay
a
little
harold
said
his
mother
dinner
is
just
ready
and
you
will
have
time
enough
the
summons
to
the
table
came
at
that
moment
and
all
answered
it
promptly
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
the
captain
harold
and
herbert
drove
into
the
first
to
see
that
all
was
right
with
the
yacht
and
order
it
brought
that
afternoon
to
the
landing
nearest
the
house
the
other
two
in
search
of
a
minister
to
perform
the
ceremony
that
was
to
unite
marian
and
the
doctor
for
life
now
said
rosie
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
we
must
help
the
bride
dress
come
mamma
and
violet
your
help
will
be
needed
for
it
is
well
known
and
freely
acknowledged
that
you
both
have
excellent
ah
sighed
cousin
ronald
i
am
sorry
there
is
no
time
for
furnishing
a
handsomer
trousseau
but
fortunately
it
can
be
done
no
no
dear
cousin
ronald
i
have
plenty
of
fine
clothes
said
marian
you
have
been
so
so
good
to
at
that
conly
remembering
the
munificent
fee
he
had
received
that
morning
smiled
quietly
to
himself
but
not
a
word
did
he
say
to
any
one
about
it
he
felt
that
words
could
not
express
his
appreciation
of
croly
s
generosity
to
himself
and
others
instrumental
in
the
saving
of
his
son
s
life
for
he
had
learned
from
harold
that
the
men
in
the
boat
that
picked
up
the
nearly
drowned
young
man
had
each
been
liberally
rewarded
the
one
who
drew
him
from
the
water
especially
so
calling
his
cousin
elsie
aside
can
we
have
any
invited
guests
do
you
think
he
asked
with
a
humorous
smile
guests
she
repeated
with
a
look
of
surprise
i
hardly
know
where
to
find
them
in
time
for
so
hastily
gotten
up
a
the
crolys
are
near
at
hand
he
suggested
oh
yes
invite
them
if
you
wish
to
she
returned
with
an
amused
laugh
but
we
can
not
get
up
anything
like
a
proper
on
so
short
a
oh
i
dare
say
they
will
make
due
allowance
for
haste
and
expect
little
entertainment
besides
a
good
look
at
the
bride
he
said
laughingly
then
i
will
send
them
a
note
of
invitation
also
one
to
the
younger
and
croly
and
to
our
poor
friend
cousin
he
said
with
a
joyous
look
i
have
something
for
your
ear
alone
other
relatives
and
friends
shall
know
of
it
by
and
then
he
read
her
croly
s
note
and
showed
its
inclosure
oh
art
i
am
so
glad
so
very
glad
she
said
her
eyes
full
of
happy
tears
yes
my
dear
fellow
give
them
all
the
warmest
of
invitations
though
i
hardly
think
will
or
his
father
or
mother
will
come
but
they
shall
have
the
warmest
of
welcomes
if
they
is
not
that
your
place
as
mistress
of
the
house
cousin
elsie
he
asked
oh
yes
she
replied
i
will
write
a
note
at
once
and
send
it
by
one
of
the
and
if
you
please
i
will
send
a
note
of
thanks
along
with
it
i
will
write
it
at
i
will
send
it
with
pleasure
she
said
oh
cousin
arthur
i
am
so
glad
for
you
it
is
not
an
extravagant
gift
for
a
man
of
croly
s
i
think
you
have
fairly
earned
it
must
make
you
quite
it
does
indeed
he
said
in
joyous
tones
and
will
put
it
in
my
power
to
make
the
dear
girl
who
is
trusting
her
happiness
to
me
very
comfortable
it
will
also
enable
me
to
help
those
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
who
may
need
you
have
always
been
a
generous
fellow
she
said
giving
him
a
look
full
of
appreciation
and
affection
but
i
think
if
they
do
all
they
can
to
help
themselves
they
will
need
very
little
assistance
from
you
but
she
added
with
a
smile
we
have
each
a
great
deal
to
do
in
a
little
time
and
must
not
hinder
each
the
delegation
sent
to
the
city
was
very
successful
the
young
men
returned
early
in
the
afternoon
bringing
the
minister
of
marian
s
choice
and
shortly
after
the
captain
came
in
from
his
yacht
which
lay
at
anchor
at
no
great
distance
from
the
shore
neither
will
croly
nor
his
mother
ventured
out
but
his
father
came
bringing
his
with
him
marian
looked
very
sweet
and
lovely
in
white
tarletan
and
brought
by
harold
from
the
city
and
arthur
still
rather
youthful
in
appearance
seemed
a
not
unsuitable
bridegroom
for
her
mary
keith
rosie
and
lulu
calhoun
harold
and
herbert
acted
the
parts
of
bridesmaids
and
groomsmen
the
ceremony
was
short
and
followed
by
some
simple
kinds
of
cake
and
lemonade
trunks
had
been
packed
and
sent
aboard
the
yacht
and
before
sundown
the
passengers
followed
the
bride
and
groom
calhoun
and
mary
and
the
captain
with
his
entire
family
it
was
not
at
all
a
sad
to
either
those
who
went
or
those
who
stayed
behind
for
it
was
expected
that
the
would
touch
frequently
at
that
port
so
that
her
passengers
could
pay
a
visit
to
the
friends
on
shore
often
on
their
return
taking
some
of
them
for
a
short
distance
out
to
sea
the
evening
air
from
the
sea
was
very
cool
and
for
marian
s
being
as
yet
not
far
from
on
the
invalid
older
people
confined
themselves
most
of
the
time
to
the
saloon
but
lulu
wrapping
a
shawl
about
her
shoulders
went
out
upon
the
deck
where
she
seated
herself
and
gazed
silently
out
upon
the
sea
they
were
steaming
northward
scarcely
out
of
sight
of
the
shore
it
was
a
beautiful
night
the
moon
shining
brightly
in
the
dark
blue
of
the
heavens
flecked
here
and
there
with
soft
fleecy
white
clouds
and
the
sea
beneath
looking
like
molten
silver
where
her
rays
touched
it
lulu
enjoyed
the
sight
and
the
delicious
breeze
that
was
blowing
softly
shoreward
yet
her
thoughts
were
on
other
matters
and
she
was
unusually
silent
and
still
she
had
no
one
to
talk
to
but
was
very
apt
when
alone
at
such
time
and
place
to
sing
softly
to
herself
she
had
not
moved
for
some
minutes
when
she
felt
a
hand
laid
gently
on
each
shoulder
while
her
father
s
voice
asked
in
affectionate
tones
what
is
my
little
girl
thinking
of
he
bent
down
over
her
as
he
spoke
and
she
looked
up
into
his
face
oh
i
m
so
glad
you
have
come
papa
she
said
are
you
daughter
he
returned
coming
around
seating
himself
by
her
side
and
putting
an
arm
about
her
waist
i
don
t
know
when
i
have
seen
you
so
perfectly
quiet
and
still
a
penny
for
your
they
re
not
worth
a
penny
papa
she
said
laughingly
laying
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
looking
up
lovingly
into
his
eyes
i
m
afraid
they
were
rather
foolish
but
you
can
have
them
for
nothing
if
you
want
them
you
know
i
belong
to
m
so
glad
i
you
have
a
right
to
my
thoughts
haven
t
you
we
will
leave
that
question
to
be
considered
at
another
time
he
returned
laughingly
hugging
her
up
closer
and
giving
her
a
kiss
but
since
you
are
willing
you
may
tell
me
what
was
the
occasion
of
so
much
grave
thought
in
this
little
careless
head
stroking
her
hair
and
repeating
his
caress
well
then
papa
it
was
mostly
about
marian
i
was
thinking
and
that
i
should
not
like
to
be
in
her
place
i
like
cousin
arthur
ever
so
much
for
a
doctor
but
to
have
to
leave
my
dear
father
and
go
to
live
with
him
instead
would
be
just
dreadful
but
then
her
father
can
t
be
one
bit
like
mine
and
i
think
that
if
i
were
his
daughter
i
d
be
glad
enough
to
leave
him
for
and
i
think
no
one
could
reasonably
blame
you
if
you
were
especially
if
as
in
marian
s
case
it
was
to
escape
being
forced
into
a
marriage
with
one
who
was
far
from
agreeable
to
you
and
had
already
several
is
a
very
wicked
thing
forbidden
by
the
law
of
both
god
and
man
but
situated
as
you
are
it
would
i
think
be
a
very
silly
thing
for
you
to
do
as
marian
has
done
even
were
you
of
her
age
and
you
are
really
some
three
or
four
years
and
that
s
a
very
great
difference
remarked
lulu
soberly
and
i
m
glad
of
it
because
i
do
so
like
to
be
my
father
s
own
little
girl
and
you
won
t
ever
make
me
get
married
if
i
don
t
want
to
will
you
papa
no
daughter
certainly
not
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
keep
you
always
and
altogether
my
it
s
so
good
of
you
you
dear
papa
she
said
nestling
closer
to
him
i
feel
almost
sure
i
shall
never
love
any
other
man
half
so
well
as
i
do
that
is
pleasant
news
to
me
he
said
with
a
smile
down
into
the
large
dark
eyes
lifted
to
his
chapter
xix
the
next
morning
after
the
sailing
of
the
brought
to
travilla
the
news
that
her
son
edward
and
his
family
accompanied
by
ella
conly
were
on
their
way
north
intending
first
to
visit
the
lelands
at
evelyn
s
cottage
on
the
hudson
then
to
come
on
to
spend
a
few
weeks
with
her
at
the
everybody
was
glad
for
the
departure
of
so
large
a
number
of
those
who
had
made
up
their
family
for
weeks
past
had
left
them
all
feeling
somewhat
lonely
hugh
lilburn
felt
very
loth
to
leave
just
as
his
betrothed
was
coming
for
the
visit
on
the
hudson
was
not
to
be
a
long
one
besides
he
was
unwilling
to
leave
his
father
to
encounter
mcalpine
without
being
there
himself
to
defend
him
in
case
the
mormon
should
become
abusive
that
he
decided
in
his
own
mind
would
be
worse
than
allowing
his
business
interests
to
suffer
somewhat
by
a
prolonged
absence
from
his
newly
acquired
property
but
it
was
growing
late
in
the
season
the
cottage
nearest
to
the
house
occupied
by
the
dinsmores
travilla
and
the
others
of
that
party
was
rented
by
them
for
the
expected
ones
from
new
york
and
in
a
week
from
the
departure
of
the
and
her
passengers
they
arrived
and
took
possession
but
they
were
much
like
one
family
taking
their
meals
at
the
larger
house
spending
the
greater
part
of
the
day
there
or
on
the
beach
or
taking
walks
and
drives
together
they
had
letters
now
and
then
from
the
party
in
the
yacht
who
seemed
to
be
enjoying
themselves
greatly
and
in
a
week
after
this
last
arrival
the
vessel
touched
at
gloucester
and
mary
keith
calhoun
herbert
and
harold
landed
spent
a
few
hours
in
the
city
then
returned
to
their
home
where
they
were
welcomed
with
demonstrations
of
delight
they
reported
that
arthur
and
his
bride
seemed
to
be
having
a
delightful
honeymoon
and
deemed
it
best
to
remain
on
the
yacht
somewhat
longer
unless
they
should
hear
of
the
whereabouts
of
mcalpine
and
know
that
they
would
be
safe
from
a
visit
from
him
which
unless
he
became
a
changed
man
would
undoubtedly
be
far
from
pleasant
i
told
them
said
calhoun
that
i
should
rather
enjoy
giving
him
a
piece
of
my
yes
probably
rather
more
than
he
would
laughed
harold
i
dare
say
returned
calhoun
but
i
can
t
say
that
i
am
particularly
anxious
or
desirous
to
give
him
pleasure
however
i
think
he
will
find
us
too
large
a
party
to
attack
with
anything
worse
than
hard
words
and
those
i
am
by
no
means
unwilling
to
stand
for
the
sake
of
my
pretty
young
marian
is
a
sweet
girl
said
mary
keith
and
as
conly
s
wife
she
has
made
certain
her
escape
from
a
dreadful
it
was
after
tea
and
they
were
all
in
the
parlor
for
it
was
a
cool
evening
cloudy
and
occasionally
drizzling
a
little
mary
had
scarcely
ceased
speaking
when
a
loud
peal
from
the
startled
every
one
harold
stepped
out
to
the
hall
to
answer
it
there
stood
a
tall
man
who
accosted
him
with
how
do
you
do
sir
i
understand
that
this
is
the
house
occupied
by
travilla
captain
raymond
and
mrs
travilla
is
here
captain
raymond
is
not
returned
harold
may
i
inquire
what
is
your
errand
to
either
of
them
yes
i
understand
that
they
are
harboring
here
a
daughter
of
mine
considerably
under
age
who
ran
away
from
me
some
months
ago
i
have
come
to
take
possession
of
her
and
let
me
say
i
intend
to
do
so
let
who
will
she
is
not
here
answered
harold
at
that
the
man
pushed
him
suddenly
and
rudely
aside
and
walked
boldly
and
defiantly
into
the
parlor
lilburn
instantly
rose
and
faced
him
william
mcalpine
what
brings
you
here
he
asked
in
stern
tones
is
it
you
ronald
lilburn
exclaimed
the
other
in
astonishment
i
thought
you
were
in
auld
scotland
and
probably
under
the
sod
long
ere
this
and
is
it
you
that
s
carried
off
my
bairn
i
have
never
seen
mormon
land
and
didna
carry
her
off
was
lilburn
s
reply
in
a
tone
full
of
scorn
and
contempt
but
if
i
d
had
the
chance
i
wad
hae
rescued
her
at
the
risk
o
my
life
from
sic
a
fate
as
beast
o
a
mon
that
ye
prepared
for
her
you
are
worse
than
a
heathen
william
mcalpine
wi
your
three
or
four
wives
and
you
broke
the
heart
o
marian
s
mither
my
ain
sweet
cousin
who
demeaned
hersel
to
marry
mean
fellow
not
fit
to
wipe
the
dust
from
her
at
that
the
man
turned
white
with
passion
and
lifted
his
clinched
fist
as
if
about
to
strike
the
old
gentleman
down
but
his
son
hugh
sprang
in
between
them
and
at
the
same
instant
edward
and
harold
sprang
forward
and
each
seized
an
arm
of
the
stalwart
stranger
while
herbert
and
calhoun
showed
themselves
ready
to
assist
in
preventing
him
from
harming
their
old
friend
but
at
that
instant
a
woman
s
voice
seemingly
coming
from
the
next
room
spoke
in
sadly
beseeching
tones
o
willie
willie
wad
ye
harm
my
own
dear
auld
cousin
who
has
never
shown
aught
but
kindness
to
us
and
ours
is
it
not
enough
that
ye
broke
the
heart
o
y
ain
wife
that
loved
ye
better
than
all
the
warld
beside
and
wad
ye
kill
my
ain
bonny
lassie
that
we
baith
loved
so
well
when
she
was
a
wee
toddling
thing
dinna
meddle
wi
her
willie
dinna
harm
a
hair
o
her
head
or
i
ll
haunt

to
the
last
day
o
your
life
forsake
your
sins
willie
put
away
your
mony
wives
and
be
a
true
servant
o
the
lord
or
ye

never
win

heaven
your
soul
will
be
lost
and
i
that
loved
ye
so
lang
syne
will
see
ye
no
more
mcalpine
s
face
turned
ghastly
white
while
he
listened
and
his
eyes
seemed
starting
from
his
head
then
as
the
voice
ceased
he
suddenly
wrenched
himself
free
from
the
hold
of
edward
and
harold
and
rushed
from
the
room
and
the
house
like
one
pursued
by
an
avenging
foe
they
heard
his
steps
echoing
down
the
garden
path
out
into
the
road
and
away
till
the
sounds
were
lost
in
the
distance
then
dinsmore
spoke
breaking
the
astonished
silence
he
is
badly
scared
and
i
think
will
hardly
return
to
pursue
his
search
for
his
missing
i
trust
not
sir
responded
cousin
ronald
fortunately
i
was
able
to
remember
and
reproduce
the
tones
of
his
dead

my
talent
is
sometimes
useful
as
well
as
a
source
of
amusement
to
my
young
and
older
ones
also
elsie
added
with
a
smile
yes
indeed
said
rosie
the
man
fairly
frightened
me
for
he
acted
as
if
he
were
wicked
enough
to
hurt
or
even
kill
every
one
of
us
i
don
t
wonder
marian
ran
away
from
him
and
was
so
frightened
at
the
very
thought
of
seeing
him
nor
i
said
zoe
looking
at
her
husband
with
eyes
full
of
tears
o
my
dear
ned
i
was
so
afraid
he
would
do
you
some
dreadful
harm
and
what
if
he
should
even
yet
he
may
come
back
oh
let
us
shut
doors
and
i
think
there
is
hardly
any
danger
of
his
returning
remarked
hugh
lilburn
in
a
reassuring
tone
at
least
not
the
other
gentlemen
agreed
in
that
opinion
and
the
ladies
were
sufficiently
reassured
to
be
able
to
pass
a
comfortable
night
but
though
they
were
ignorant
of
the
fact
mcalpine
was
in
no
condition
to
injure
any
of
them
or
even
to
return
to
their
dwelling
in
the
darkness
and
the
confusion
of
his
mind
he
had
wandered
from
the
path
and
fallen
down
a
hill
landing
on
a
bed
of
stones
striking
his
head
on
one
of
them
so
that
he
was
insensible
for
some
hours
breaking
a
rib
and
receiving
internal
injuries
that
proved
fatal
in
a
very
short
time
in
the
morning
some
one
passing
heard
his
groans
went
for
assistance
and
he
was
carried
into
a
house
and
a
surgeon
sent
for
who
after
making
an
examination
told
him
he
had
but
a
few
hours
to
live
and
if
he
had
any
affairs
to
settle
he
would
do
well
to
attend
to
them
immediately
mcalpine
was
thrown
into
great
distress
of
mind
by
the
announcement
and
begged
to
have
word
sent
to
the
house
where
he
had
been
the
night
before
with
an
earnest
request
that
lilburn
would
come
to
him
for
at
least
a
few
moments
as
he
had
something
he
wished
to
say
shocked
at
the
news
of
the
man
s
condition
lilburn
at
once
hastened
to
his
bedside
they
tell
me
i
m
a
dying
mon
ronald
lilburn
and
i
maun
ease
my
mind
afore
i
die
wi
a
word
for
my
daughter
marian
tell
her
for
me
that
i
own
i
ve
been
a
hard
father
to
her
and
god
forgive
cruel
unfaithful
husband
to
her
mither
after
i
turned
mormon
it
s
a
lustful
wicked
pretence
o
a
religion
is
mormonism
and
i
dinna
want
sandy
brought
up
to
believe
in
he
paused
from
exhaustion
and
lilburn
told
of
his
plans
for
sandy
and
the
offers
he
had
made
the
lad
to
educate
and
start
him
in
life
god
bless
you
for
it
returned
the
dying
man
i
find
now
my
death
is
near
that
i
care
more
for
those
two
o
my
bairns
than
i
thought
and
now
i
maun
think
o
my
soul
o
ronald
lilburn
what
must
i
do
to
be
saved
is
there
ony
hope
for
such
a
sinner
as
i
yes
william
the
blood
o
jesus
christ
his
son
cleanseth
us
from
all
sin
and
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
flee
to
jesus
the
sinner
s
friend
remembering
his
own
words
him
that
cometh
unto
me
i
will
in
no
wise
cast
lord
i
come
i
come
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
save
me
for
thine
own
name
s
sake
came
in
earnest
pleading
tones
from
the
dying
lips
a
few
breaths
followed
and
the
soul
had
fled
the
was
known
to
be
far
out
at
sea
word
of
her
father
s
arrival
and
his
speedy
and
unexpected
death
could
not
be
sent
to
marian
so
the
body
was
carried
to
an
undertaker
s
and
the
next
day
quietly
buried
from
there
lilburn
his
son
and
the
other
gentlemen
of
the
family
attending
the
funeral
services
when
at
length
the
news
reached
marian
something
of
her
early
love
for
her
father
seemed
to
return
to
her
she
shed
some
tears
over
it
yet
in
a
short
time
her
grief
was
more
than
swallowed
up
in
a
sense
of
relief
she
was
very
very
happy
with
arthur
who
proved
himself
the
kindest
and
best
of
husbands
it
was
not
thought
necessary
that
her
father
s
death
should
be
made
known
in
their
home
neighborhood
and
on
her
return
she
dressed
as
a
bride
her
husband
had
told
her
of
his
improved
circumstances
and
was
disposed
to
lavish
upon
her
everything
that
heart
could
wish
but
she
was
not
extravagant
in
her
tastes
or
desires
and
he
was
satisfied
to
let
her
follow
her
own
inclination
in
regard
to
that
and
the
continuing
of
her
studies
with
captain
raymond
at
least
for
a
time
that
pleased
the
captain
and
he
was
more
than
willing
to
receive
her
as
a
pupil
when
they
should
all
return
home
and
he
resume
his
labors
as
instructor
the
entire
family
had
now
been
let
into
the
secret
of
arthur
s
wonderfully
large
fee
for
his
medical
service
to
william
croly
and
heartily
rejoiced
with
him
dick
percival
joined
them
for
a
week
at
the
after
which
all
returned
to
their
homes
calhoun
had
tried
to
induce
his
mary
to
follow
with
him
the
example
set
them
by
his
brother
and
marian
and
hugh
lilburn
let
his
ella
know
that
he
would
be
far
from
objecting
to
making
it
a
double
wedding
but
neither
lady
would
consent
each
wished
to
go
home
first
and
make
suitable
preparations
for
the
important
event
ella
adding
that
isadore
and
the
other
sisters
and
brothers
would
have
reason
to
be
hurt
if
she
did
not
invite
them
all
to
be
present
at
her
wedding
and
dinsmore
and
travilla
thought
she
took
a
proper
view
of
the
matter
as
did
mary
also
in
regard
to
the
time
and
place
of
her
own
nuptials
so
calhoun
took
her
to
her
own
home
and
left
her
there
with
the
understanding
that
he
was
to
return
for
her
some
weeks
or
months
day
having
not
yet
been
fixed
upon
but
before
leaving
their
home
all
spent
a
day
there
together
naturally
one
of
the
principal
topics
of
conversation
was
the
approaching
journey
to
their
southern
homes
i
wish
i
could
take
you
all
with
me
in
the
yacht
said
captain
raymond
addressing
the
company
in
general
but
unfortunately
there
is
not
accommodation
for
so
many
mother
we
must
have
you
and
grandpa
and
grandma
dinsmore
as
it
is
a
more
restful
way
to
travel
than
by
the
cars
the
doctor
and
his
bride
are
already
engaged
to
us
and
we
must
i
think
take
evelyn
rosie
and
walter
we
should
hardly
know
what
to
do
without
them
any
longer
he
added
with
his
pleasant
smile
we
have
eight
family
and
passenger
and
beds
can
be
made
up
at
nights
in
the
saloon
he
continued
and
in
that
way
we
can
make
room
for
several
he
paused
for
a
reply
but
no
one
spoke
each
seemingly
waiting
for
the
others
at
length
violet
said
i
think
you
and
your
babies
should
be
with
us
zoe
then
of
course
edward
would
need
to
be
there
to
take
care
of
you
all
for
he
would
not
be
willing
to
trust
that
business
to
any
one
else
and
harold
and
herbert
ought
to
be
with
their
mother
having
poor
little
lads
been
so
much
away
from
her
for
the
last
few
years
she
added
in
a
sportive
tone
every
one
approved
and
so
it
was
settled
the
journey
was
a
safe
and
prosperous
one
with
all
they
arrived
at
their
homes
ion
woodburn
and
roselands
without
accident
or
loss
and
presently
had
settled
down
for
the
duties
and
pleasures
of
the
fall
and
coming
winter

end
