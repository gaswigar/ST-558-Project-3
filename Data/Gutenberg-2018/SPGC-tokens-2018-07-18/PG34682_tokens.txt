the
a
blanket
of
fog
thick
and
damp
swirled
about
the
decks
of
the
excursion
steamer
cautiously
plying
its
course
down
the
river
at
intervals
above
the
steady
throb
of
the
ship
engines
a
fog
horn
sounded
its
mournful
warning
to
small
craft
i
hope
we
do
collide
with
another
boat
before
we
make
the
dock
remarked
louise
sidell
who
stood
at
the
railing
with
her
chum
penelope
parker
that
would
be
a
perfect
ending
for
an
imperfect
day
returned
penny
fitting
her
coat
collar
more
snugly
about
her
throat
an
imperfect
day
i
call
it
a
miserable
one
rain
and
fog
rain
and
fog
it
made
my
hair
as
straight
as
the
shortest
distance
between
two
points
mine
as
kinky
as
wool
impatiently
penny
brushed
a
ringlet
of
golden
hair
from
her
eyes
well
shall
we
go
inside
again
no
i
rather
freeze
than
be
a
wallflower
the
girl
responded
gloomily
we
have
been
asked
to
dance
once
this
evening
that
because
we
came
without
our
own
crowd
lou
except
for
that
couple
yonder
we
practically
the
only
persons
aboard
unattached
to
a
group
penny
jerked
her
head
in
the
direction
of
a
young
man
and
girl
who
slowly
paced
the
deck
earlier
in
the
evening
their
peculiar
actions
had
attracted
her
attention
they
kept
strictly
to
themselves
avoiding
the
salon
the
dining
room
and
all
contact
with
other
excursionists
i
wonder
who
they
are
mused
louise
turning
to
stare
the
girl
wears
a
veil
as
if
she
were
afraid
someone
might
recognize
her
yes
i
noticed
that
and
whenever
anyone
goes
near
her
she
lowers
her
head
i
wish
we
could
see
her
face
let
wander
over
that
way
proposed
louise
arm
in
arm
they
sauntered
toward
the
couple
the
young
man
saw
them
coming
he
touched
his
companion
arm
and
turning
their
backs
they
walked
away
they
did
that
to
avoid
meeting
us
louise
declared
in
an
excited
undertone
now
why
i
wonder
the
couple
had
reached
the
end
of
the
deck
as
the
young
woman
turned
to
glance
over
her
shoulder
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
caught
her
hat
before
she
could
save
it
the
was
swept
dangerously
close
to
the
railing
not
giving
the
young
man
an
opportunity
to
act
penny
darted
forward
rescuing
the
hat
she
carried
it
to
the
couple
thank
you
the
girl
mumbled
keeping
her
head
lowered
thank
you
very
much
quickly
she
jammed
the
felt
hat
on
her
head
and
replaced
the
veil
but
not
before
penny
had
seen
her
face
clearly
the
young
woman
was
unusually
pretty
with
large
brown
eyes
and
a
long
smoothly
brushed
black
bob
this
is
certainly
a
miserable
night
penny
remarked
hoping
to
start
a
conversation
sure
is
replied
the
young
man
with
discouraging
brevity
he
tipped
his
hat
and
steered
his
companion
away
from
the
girl
ruefully
penny
returned
to
louise
who
had
been
an
interested
spectator
did
you
get
a
good
look
at
the
pair
she
asked
eagerly
yes
but
i
never
seen
either
of
them
before
they
would
talk
no
and
the
girl
lowered
her
veil
as
soon
as
she
could
perhaps
she
a
movie
actress
traveling
in
disguise
aboard
a
river
excursion
boat
i
afraid
not
lou
then
maybe
she
a
criminal
trying
to
elude
the
police
i
fear
the
mystery
of
her
identity
must
remain
forever
unsolved
chuckled
penny
we
dock
in
another
five
minutes
through
the
fog
could
be
seen
a
dim
glow
of
lights
along
the
riverview
wharf
the
its
whistle
tooting
repeated
signals
was
proceeding
more
slowly
than
ever
sailors
stood
ready
to
make
the
vessel
fast
to
the
dock
posts
when
she
touched
passengers
began
to
pour
from
the
salon
and
penny
and
louise
joined
the
throng
many
persons
pushed
and
jostled
each
other
trying
to
obtain
a
position
close
to
the
gangplank
suddenly
a
girl
who
stood
not
far
from
penny
gave
an
alarmed
cry
my
pocketbook
it
gone
those
near
her
expressed
polite
concern
and
assisted
in
searching
the
deck
the
missing
purse
was
not
found
before
the
captain
could
be
notified
the
gangplank
was
lowered
and
the
passengers
began
to
disembark
from
the
steamer
the
girl
whose
pocketbook
had
been
lost
remained
by
the
railing
quite
forgotten
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
excuse
me
said
penny
addressing
her
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
help
disconsolately
the
girl
shook
her
head
she
made
a
most
unattractive
picture
for
her
blouse
was
wrinkled
and
her
skirt
was
spotted
with
an
ugly
coffee
stain
beneath
a
brown
misshapen
hat
hung
a
tangle
of
brown
hair
someone
stole
my
pocketbook
she
said
listlessly
i
had
twelve
dollars
in
it
too
you
sure
you
did
leave
it
anywhere
louise
inquired
no
i
had
it
in
my
hand
only
a
minute
ago
i
think
someone
lifted
it
in
the
crowd
a
pickpocket
no
doubt
penny
agreed
i
been
told
they
frequent
these
river
boats
nearly
everyone
has
left
the
steamer
now
so
i
suppose
it
would
do
no
good
to
notify
the
captain
commented
louise
she
and
penny
started
to
turn
away
then
paused
as
they
noticed
that
the
girl
remained
in
the
same
dejected
posture
you
have
friends
meeting
you
at
the
boat
penny
inquired
kindly
i
have
any
friends
not
in
riverview
none
penny
asked
in
surprise
do
you
live
here
no
answered
the
girl
i
been
working
as
a
waitress
at
flintville
the
job
played
out
last
week
today
i
took
this
boat
thinking
i
might
find
work
in
riverview
now
i
lost
my
purse
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
or
where
to
go
have
you
any
money
inquired
penny
not
a
cent
i
i
guess
i
have
to
sleep
in
the
park
tonight
no
you
wo
declared
penny
impulsively
she
opened
her
own
purse
and
removing
a
five
dollar
bill
thrust
it
into
the
girl
hand
this
is
much
but
it
may
tide
you
over
until
you
can
find
work
oh
you
kind
to
help
me
i
pay
you
back
just
as
soon
as
i
get
a
job
do
worry
about
that
replied
penny
however
i
should
like
to
know
your
name
tillie
fellows
mine
is
penelope
parker
and
my
friend
is
louise
sidell
well
good
luck
in
finding
that
job
edging
away
from
tillie
who
would
have
detained
them
indefinitely
the
girls
crossed
the
gangplank
to
shore
you
were
generous
to
give
a
stranger
five
dollars
penny
commented
louise
when
they
were
beyond
hearing
oh
she
needed
it
your
allowance
money
was
it
yes
but
i
could
allow
the
girl
to
go
hungry
or
sleep
in
the
park
no
i
suppose
not
replied
louise
penny
paused
scanning
the
crowd
on
the
dock
her
father
anthony
parker
had
promised
to
meet
the
excursion
boat
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
or
his
car
dad
must
have
been
detained
at
the
newspaper
office
she
remarked
i
suppose
we
must
wait
here
until
he
comes
removing
themselves
from
the
stream
of
traffic
the
girls
walked
a
short
distance
along
the
dock
halting
beside
a
warehouse
the
throng
rapidly
dispersed
and
still
parker
did
not
arrive
i
hope
we
have
missed
him
penny
remarked
anxiously
in
this
fog
one
ca
see
many
yards
they
had
waited
only
a
few
minutes
longer
when
louise
suddenly
touched
her
chum
arm
penny
there
she
is
alone
too
who
louise
why
that
girl
whose
hat
you
recovered
on
the
see
her
coming
this
way
penny
turned
to
stare
at
the
young
woman
who
was
walking
hurriedly
along
the
dock
at
first
glance
she
was
inclined
to
agree
with
louise
that
it
was
the
same
girl
then
she
was
uncertain
the
one
who
approached
wore
an
expensive
fur
and
carried
a
distinctive
beaded
bag
i
do
believe
i
ever
saw
her
before
she
commented
i
guess
i
was
mistaken
admitted
louise
she
too
well
dressed
apparently
the
girl
did
not
observe
penny
and
her
chum
for
she
passed
them
without
a
glance
hurriedly
she
walked
a
short
distance
down
the
wharf
then
with
a
deft
movement
she
took
a
package
from
beneath
her
coat
and
tossed
it
into
the
water
turning
she
retraced
her
steps
to
the
gangplank
of
the
a
moment
later
the
girls
saw
her
meet
a
young
man
in
topcoat
and
derby
who
had
emerged
from
the
crowd
on
the
dock
entering
a
gray
sedan
they
drove
away
i
wonder
what
she
threw
into
the
river
mused
penny
did
you
think
she
acted
as
if
she
were
afraid
someone
would
see
her
lou
yes
i
did
whatever
it
was
it
gone
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
curiously
the
girls
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
dock
penny
glanced
over
the
side
and
gave
an
excited
cry
instead
of
falling
into
the
water
the
package
had
caught
fast
on
a
jagged
dock
post
it
hanging
by
the
string
she
exclaimed
eagerly
louise
peered
down
you
right
she
agreed
but
we
ca
get
it
i
going
to
try
please
do
pleaded
louise
it
too
far
down
you
tumble
into
the
water
not
if
you
sit
on
my
heels
undisturbed
by
what
anyone
who
saw
her
might
think
penny
stretched
flat
on
the
dock
with
louise
holding
to
her
she
over
the
edge
clutching
at
the
bundle
which
dangled
an
inch
above
the
water
got
it
she
chuckled
haul
away
lou
louise
pulled
her
friend
to
safety
eagerly
they
examined
the
package
which
was
wrapped
in
ordinary
newspaper
i
venture
it
contains
nothing
more
than
the
remains
of
a
lunch
declared
louise
this
is
going
to
be
a
good
joke
on
you
penny
a
joke
quavered
penny
her
gaze
had
focused
upon
a
hole
in
the
paper
through
the
opening
protruded
a
long
strand
of
dark
hair
louise
saw
it
at
the
same
instant
and
uttered
a
choked
horrified
scream
human
hair
she
gasped
oh
penny
turn
it
over
to
the
police
it
ca
be
that
said
penny
in
a
calmer
voice
with
trembling
fingers
she
untied
the
string
the
paper
fell
away
and
several
objects
dropped
at
penny
feet
stooping
she
picked
up
a
long
black
wig
in
addition
there
was
a
dark
veil
a
crushed
felt
hat
and
a
cheap
cloth
jacket
a
disguise
exclaimed
louise
yes
the
girl
who
tossed
this
bundle
into
the
river
was
the
same
one
we
saw
aboard
the
steamer
but
why
did
she
wear
these
things
and
then
try
to
get
rid
of
them
why
penny
do
you
understand
louise
demanded
impressively
she
was
a
crook
just
as
i
thought
and
she
must
have
been
the
one
who
robbed
tillie
fellows
chapter
river
penny
stared
at
the
curious
array
of
objects
found
in
the
discarded
bundle
unquestionably
they
had
been
worn
by
the
mysterious
young
woman
observed
aboard
the
however
she
was
not
certain
she
agreed
with
louise
that
the
girl
or
her
escort
had
robbed
tillie
fellows
i
never
heard
of
a
professional
pickpocket
bothering
with
a
disguise
she
said
doubtfully
why
else
would
the
girl
wear
one
i
have
an
idea
admitted
penny
everything
about
it
is
queer
for
instance
what
became
of
her
escort
after
the
steamer
docked
and
who
was
that
other
young
man
in
the
gray
car
he
appeared
to
be
fairly
yes
he
did
for
that
matter
the
girl
was
elegantly
dressed
louise
kicked
at
the
bundle
with
her
foot
what
shall
we
do
with
these
things
toss
them
away
indeed
not
penny
carefully
rewrapped
the
wig
jacket
and
other
articles
in
the
crumpled
newspaper
i
shall
take
them
home
with
me
one
never
knows
what
may
develop
before
louise
could
inquire
the
meaning
of
her
chum
remark
a
taxi
drew
up
nearby
the
door
swung
open
and
out
leaped
a
lean
young
man
in
a
blue
suit
and
hat
why
it
jerry
livingston
exclaimed
penny
recognizing
one
of
her
father
reporters
the
young
man
saw
the
girls
and
came
toward
them
hello
he
greeted
cheerily
swell
night
for
a
murder
i
hope
you
not
carrying
concealed
weapons
laughed
penny
dad
delayed
at
the
office
he
sent
me
to
meet
the
boat
in
his
place
the
fog
made
traffic
slow
that
why
i
late
taking
each
of
the
girls
by
an
elbow
he
steered
them
to
the
waiting
taxi
he
instructed
the
driver
and
slammed
the
car
door
the
fog
was
not
so
dense
after
the
cab
left
the
docks
but
the
entire
river
valley
was
blanketed
making
it
necessary
for
automobiles
to
proceed
with
headlights
turned
on
have
a
nice
time
jerry
inquired
as
the
cab
crept
along
the
waterfront
streets
not
very
answered
penny
but
we
ran
into
a
little
adventure
trust
you
for
that
chuckled
the
reporter
city
editor
dewitt
was
telling
the
boys
at
the
office
that
he
bet
you
would
come
home
dragging
a
mystery
by
its
tail
here
it
is
penny
laughed
thrusting
the
newspaper
bundle
into
his
hands
lou
and
i
did
a
little
fishing
from
the
dock
and
this
is
what
we
hooked
while
jerry
examined
the
contents
of
the
strange
package
the
girls
competed
with
each
other
in
relating
their
experiences
aboard
the
steamer
although
the
reporter
was
deeply
interested
he
could
offer
no
theory
to
explain
why
the
young
woman
had
discarded
the
bundle
of
clothing
louise
guess
seems
as
good
as
any
he
commented
the
girl
may
have
been
the
one
who
robbed
tillie
fellows
pickpockets
usually
frequent
crowds
said
penny
during
the
entire
trip
both
the
girl
and
her
escort
kept
strictly
to
themselves
jerry
retied
the
bundle
tossing
it
into
her
lap
your
mystery
is
too
much
for
me
he
said
lightly
afraid
you
have
to
solve
it
yourself
penny
lapsed
into
meditative
silence
yet
oddly
her
thoughts
centered
upon
nothing
in
particular
for
a
reason
she
never
tried
to
explain
the
waterfront
seldom
failed
to
cast
its
magical
spell
over
her
she
loved
the
medley
of
sounds
blasts
of
coal
boats
mingling
with
the
staccato
toots
of
the
tugboats
the
rumble
and
clank
of
bridges
being
raised
and
lowered
always
penny
had
felt
an
intimate
connection
with
the
river
for
her
home
overlooked
the
big
bear
not
many
miles
away
flowed
the
kobalt
so
closely
associated
with
joe
and
the
vanishing
houseboat
it
was
the
kobalt
which
very
nearly
had
claimed
jerry
life
yet
had
brought
the
one
of
its
greatest
news
stories
ever
since
she
was
a
little
girl
penny
had
loved
newspaper
work
her
entire
life
seemed
bound
up
with
printer
ink
and
all
that
it
connoted
she
had
learned
to
write
well
and
weems
who
had
served
as
the
parker
housekeeper
for
many
years
predicted
that
one
day
the
girl
would
become
a
celebrated
journalist
the
taxi
came
to
a
sudden
halt
and
with
a
start
penny
emerged
from
her
reverie
jerry
leaned
forward
to
ask
the
driver
why
they
had
stopped
i
ca
see
the
road
very
well
the
man
replied
and
there
a
bridge
ahead
as
the
car
crept
forward
again
penny
peered
from
the
window
through
the
swirling
gray
mist
the
indistinct
lights
which
marked
the
arching
steel
bridge
were
faintly
visible
a
pillar
gradually
emerged
and
beside
it
the
shadowy
slouching
figure
of
a
man
his
burning
cigarette
made
a
pin
point
of
light
as
he
tossed
it
into
the
river
suddenly
penny
blood
ran
cold
for
a
second
man
appeared
on
the
bridge
stealthily
he
approached
the
one
who
gazed
with
such
absorption
into
the
inky
waters
his
purpose
was
shockingly
clear
to
those
who
watched
penny
screamed
a
warning
the
taxi
driver
halted
his
cab
shouting
huskily
their
cries
came
too
late
they
saw
the
attacker
leap
upon
his
victim
there
was
a
brief
intense
struggle
then
a
body
went
hurtling
from
the
bridge
fifty
feet
to
the
water
below
you
saw
that
cried
penny
that
man
was
pushed
off
the
bridge
drown
we
got
to
save
him
said
jerry
as
the
cab
came
to
a
standstill
jerry
the
driver
and
the
two
girls
sprang
to
the
pavement
in
the
murky
darkness
the
bridge
appeared
deserted
but
they
could
hear
the
pounding
footsteps
of
the
attacker
who
sought
to
escape
leave
that
guy
to
me
exclaimed
the
cab
driver
i
get
him
abandoning
his
taxi
he
darted
across
the
bridge
in
pursuit
jerry
and
the
girls
ran
to
the
river
bank
below
they
could
see
a
man
struggling
in
the
water
and
hear
his
choked
cry
for
help
jerry
kicked
off
his
shoes
wait
commanded
penny
you
may
not
need
to
jump
in
after
him
that
boat
will
be
there
in
a
minute
she
indicated
a
tugboat
which
had
passed
beneath
the
bridge
and
was
swerving
toward
the
struggling
man
as
the
young
people
anxiously
watched
they
saw
it
lay
to
while
the
captain
fished
the
victim
from
the
water
with
a
thank
goodness
for
that
murmured
penny
i
hope
the
poor
fellow
is
all
right
and
i
hope
our
driver
catches
the
man
who
did
the
pushing
declared
louise
feelingly
i
never
witnessed
a
more
vicious
attack
in
my
entire
life
as
she
spoke
the
cabman
recrossed
the
bridge
scrambling
down
to
the
river
bank
the
fellow
got
away
he
reported
he
had
a
car
waiting
you
did
see
the
license
number
jerry
inquired
not
a
chance
too
bad
penny
was
watching
the
tugboat
which
had
been
tied
up
only
a
short
distance
from
the
bridge
jerry
let
go
down
there
she
proposed
i
want
to
be
certain
that
man
is
all
right
the
reporter
hesitated
then
consented
leaving
louise
with
the
cab
driver
he
and
penny
descended
the
steep
muddy
slope
the
boat
had
been
made
fast
to
a
piling
face
downward
on
the
long
leather
seat
of
the
lay
the
rescued
man
working
over
him
was
the
captain
a
short
stocky
man
with
hands
and
clothing
saturated
with
coal
dust
anything
we
can
do
called
jerry
from
shore
do
know
yet
if
he
need
a
doctor
answered
the
tugboat
captain
barely
glancing
up
it
was
a
nasty
fall
jerry
leaped
on
deck
leaving
penny
behind
for
the
space
was
too
wide
to
be
easily
spanned
inside
the
cabin
captain
dubbins
was
expertly
applying
artificial
resuscitation
but
he
paused
as
the
man
on
the
seat
showed
signs
of
reviving
struck
the
water
flat
on
his
back
he
commented
briefly
lucky
i
saw
him
fall
or
i
never
could
have
fished
him
out
not
on
a
night
like
this
the
fellow
did
fall
corrected
jerry
he
was
pushed
captain
dubbins
glanced
up
meeting
the
reporter
gaze
steadily
he
offered
no
comment
for
the
man
on
the
seat
groaned
and
rolled
over
steady
said
the
captain
take
it
easy
you
tumble
off
the
seat
if
you
do
stay
quiet
my
back
mumbled
the
man
in
the
glare
of
the
swinging
electric
light
his
face
was
ghastly
white
and
contorted
with
pain
jerry
judged
him
to
be
perhaps
he
wore
blue
trousers
and
a
coarse
flannel
shirt
my
back
he
moaned
again
pressing
his
hand
to
it
you
took
a
hard
wrench
when
you
hit
the
water
commented
the
captain
here
let
see
he
unbuttoned
the
shirt
and
rolling
the
man
over
started
to
strip
it
off
no
snarled
the
other
with
surprising
spirit
leave
me
alone
get
away
jerry
stepped
forward
to
assist
the
captain
ignoring
the
man
feeble
struggles
they
pulled
off
his
shirt
immediately
they
understood
why
he
had
tried
to
prevent
its
removal
across
his
bruised
battered
back
had
been
tattooed
in
blue
and
black
the
repulsive
figure
of
an
octopus
chapter
octopus
jerry
bent
closer
to
examine
the
strange
tattoo
between
the
two
foremost
arms
of
the
octopus
was
sketched
a
single
word
all
he
read
aloud
what
does
that
signify
his
question
angered
the
man
on
the
couch
snatching
the
shirt
from
captain
dubbins
he
made
a
feeble
ineffectual
effort
to
get
his
arms
into
it
i
want
out
o
here
he
muttered
quit
starin
you
two
and
give
me
a
hand
take
it
easy
advised
the
tugboat
captain
soothingly
we
was
just
tryin
to
see
if
your
back
was
badly
hurt
sorry
the
man
muttered
relaxing
he
leaned
weakly
against
the
leather
cushions
i
ai
myself
you
swallowed
a
little
water
remarked
the
captain
a
little
growled
the
other
half
the
river
went
down
my
gullet
as
an
afterthought
he
added
thanks
for
pullin
me
out
you
welcome
responded
the
captain
dryly
are
you
yeah
how
did
you
know
i
can
usually
tell
out
of
work
no
the
man
curt
answers
made
it
clear
that
he
resented
questions
you
have
told
us
your
name
john
munn
the
man
replied
after
a
slight
hesitation
we
tried
to
catch
the
man
who
pushed
you
off
the
bridge
contributed
jerry
he
got
away
the
sailor
gazed
steadily
almost
defiantly
at
the
reporter
no
one
pushed
me
off
the
bridge
he
said
i
fell
you
fell
echoed
jerry
why
i
thought
i
saw
you
and
another
man
struggling
you
thought
wrong
the
sailor
interrupted
i
was
leaning
over
into
the
water
an
i
lost
my
balance
that
was
how
it
happened
as
you
please
munn
said
jerry
with
exaggerated
politeness
oh
by
the
way
what
the
significance
of
that
octopus
thing
on
your
back
leave
me
alone
will
you
the
sailor
muttered
ai
a
man
got
any
right
to
privacy
better
not
bother
him
while
he
feeling
so
low
said
the
tugboat
captain
significantly
i
get
him
into
some
dry
clothes
nothing
i
can
do
no
thanks
he
be
all
right
well
so
long
jerry
said
carelessly
with
another
curious
glance
directed
at
the
sailor
he
left
the
leaping
from
the
deck
to
shore
penny
stood
waiting
jerry
what
was
the
matter
with
that
fellow
she
demanded
in
a
whisper
what
did
he
have
on
his
back
and
why
did
he
lie
about
being
pushed
off
the
bridge
you
heard
us
talking
i
could
help
it
you
were
fairly
shouting
at
each
other
for
awhile
john
munn
was
very
grateful
to
the
captain
for
being
saved
he
took
offense
when
we
tried
to
look
at
his
back
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
something
about
an
octopus
was
it
a
tattoo
jerry
yes
and
as
strange
a
one
as
i
ever
seen
the
picture
of
an
octopus
between
its
forearms
was
the
word
what
could
that
mean
i
tried
to
learn
but
john
munn
was
in
a
talkative
mood
it
seems
rather
mysterious
does
it
oh
i
do
know
jerry
took
penny
arm
to
aid
her
in
making
the
steep
climb
sailors
have
some
funny
ideas
regarding
this
munn
was
a
peculiar
fellow
it
was
odd
that
he
would
lie
about
being
pushed
off
the
bridge
jerry
will
you
write
it
for
the
paper
the
story
is
worth
more
than
a
few
lines
penny
we
ca
say
that
munn
was
pushed
off
the
bridge
why
not
it
true
munn
would
deny
it
and
then
the
would
appear
ridiculous
if
i
owned
a
paper
i
certainly
would
use
the
story
declared
penny
why
it
has
wonderful
possibilities
i
fear
your
father
never
would
agree
you
talk
him
into
printing
the
yarn
and
i
be
glad
to
write
it
oh
i
suppose
we
must
forget
about
it
penny
grumbled
all
the
same
i
like
nothing
better
than
to
work
on
the
story
myself
reaching
the
pavement
they
cleaned
mud
from
their
shoes
before
walking
on
to
the
waiting
taxi
louise
immediately
plied
them
with
questions
displaying
particular
interest
in
the
octopus
tattoo
do
you
suppose
the
man
knew
who
pushed
him
off
the
bridge
she
inquired
thoughtfully
i
venture
he
did
replied
penny
probably
that
was
the
reason
he
would
tell
the
taxi
crossed
the
bridge
and
made
slow
progress
away
from
the
river
as
the
road
gradually
wound
toward
higher
ground
the
fog
became
lighter
and
the
driver
was
able
to
make
faster
time
a
clock
chimed
the
hour
of
eleven
how
about
stopping
somewhere
for
a
bite
to
eat
jerry
suddenly
proposed
wo
dad
be
waiting
at
the
office
penny
asked
he
suggested
that
i
keep
you
girls
entertained
until
around
if
i
could
that
being
the
case
we
accept
your
invitation
with
alacrity
laughed
penny
how
about
the
golden
pheasant
oh
no
you
do
phillip
bean
pot
is
nearer
my
speed
a
block
farther
down
the
street
jerry
paid
the
driver
and
escorted
the
girls
into
a
clean
but
restaurant
no
item
on
the
menu
over
ten
cents
he
chuckled
do
your
worst
i
can
take
it
penny
and
louise
ordered
sandwiches
while
the
reporter
fortified
himself
with
a
plate
of
scrambled
eggs
two
doughnuts
and
a
cup
of
coffee
returning
to
the
front
counter
for
a
forgotten
napkin
he
nodded
carelessly
at
an
elderly
man
who
sat
alone
sipping
a
glass
of
orange
juice
the
man
acknowledged
the
greeting
in
an
embarrassed
way
quickly
lowering
his
head
within
a
few
minutes
he
left
the
café
jerry
who
was
he
penny
inquired
curiously
i
am
sure
i
seen
him
before
yet
i
ca
remember
where
that
was
old
man
judson
matthew
judson
not
the
former
publisher
of
the
yes
the
old
man
been
going
to
pieces
fast
since
he
closed
his
newspaper
plant
looks
seedy
does
he
his
clothes
were
a
bit
shiny
i
thought
he
seemed
rather
embarrassed
because
you
spoke
to
him
old
judson
feels
his
i
guess
in
the
flush
days
he
would
be
caught
dead
in
a
beanery
is
he
really
poor
jerry
probably
down
to
his
last
hundred
thousand
the
reporter
grinned
what
you
say
is
conflicting
declared
penny
impatiently
first
you
imply
that
judson
is
poor
and
then
that
he
rich
i
wish
you
would
make
up
your
mind
frankly
i
do
know
judson
owns
a
fine
home
on
drexell
boulevard
which
he
allowed
to
run
down
i
been
told
he
sold
the
building
several
months
ago
some
say
he
has
plenty
of
cash
salted
away
others
that
he
broke
how
did
he
lose
so
much
of
his
money
jerry
no
one
seems
to
know
for
certain
according
to
rumor
he
plays
the
stock
market
heavily
it
strange
he
closed
down
the
penny
remarked
thoughtfully
i
always
thought
it
was
a
profitable
paper
so
did
everyone
else
the
had
a
large
circulation
but
one
bright
monday
morning
judson
posted
a
notice
closed
the
plant
and
threw
over
a
thousand
employes
out
of
work
that
was
nearly
a
year
ago
was
it
jerry
thirteen
months
to
be
exact
why
this
sudden
interest
in
judson
oh
i
do
know
penny
replied
vaguely
his
case
seems
rather
pathetic
then
too
he
reminds
me
of
someone
i
seen
recently
i
wish
i
could
recall
jerry
glanced
at
the
wall
clock
swallowing
his
coffee
with
a
gulp
time
to
move
along
he
announced
we
must
keep
your
father
waiting
penny
they
left
the
café
and
jerry
hailed
a
passing
taxicab
it
only
four
blocks
to
the
building
protested
penny
you
being
too
lavish
with
your
money
jerry
oh
i
add
this
item
to
my
expense
account
he
laughed
jump
in
the
taxi
turned
left
at
adams
street
rolling
slowly
through
the
downtown
business
section
jerry
peered
from
the
car
window
at
a
large
stone
building
which
occupied
a
corner
that
place
sure
looks
like
a
morgue
these
days
he
commented
morning
penny
and
louise
likewise
twisted
sideways
to
stare
at
the
dark
deserted
building
windows
were
plastered
with
disfiguring
posters
and
the
white
stone
blocks
once
so
beautiful
were
streaked
with
city
grime
when
the
closed
machinery
furniture
and
everything
else
was
left
exactly
as
it
stood
remarked
jerry
too
bad
an
enterprising
newspaper
man
does
take
over
the
place
before
it
a
complete
loss
the
present
owner
does
even
employ
a
watchman
to
protect
the
property
it
does
seem
a
shame
penny
began
only
to
break
off
why
funny
what
is
inquired
jerry
penny
had
turned
to
glance
back
at
the
plant
the
building
is
deserted
she
exclaimed
there
a
light
in
one
of
the
upstairs
rooms
chapter
prospective
jerry
rolled
down
the
window
beside
him
and
thrusting
his
head
through
it
glanced
back
at
the
building
where
do
you
see
a
light
he
demanded
it
was
on
the
third
floor
declared
penny
i
ca
see
it
myself
now
jerry
grinned
as
he
settled
back
into
his
place
between
the
two
girls
you
certainly
get
a
kick
out
of
playing
jokes
he
accused
but
it
was
a
joke
jerry
honestly
i
saw
a
light
did
you
louise
sorry
but
i
did
i
afraid
your
imagination
works
overtime
pet
i
know
what
i
saw
insisted
penny
as
jerry
and
louise
smiled
she
lapsed
into
injured
silence
however
she
was
certain
she
had
not
been
mistaken
distinctly
she
had
observed
a
light
on
the
third
floor
a
moving
light
which
had
been
extinguished
before
her
companions
had
noticed
it
the
car
presently
drew
up
at
the
curb
in
front
of
the
building
anthony
parker
a
newspaper
tucked
beneath
his
arm
stepped
from
the
vestibule
where
he
had
been
waiting
he
was
a
tall
slender
man
alert
and
courageous
in
following
his
convictions
under
his
management
the
had
grown
to
be
one
of
the
most
influential
papers
in
the
state
hope
we
have
kept
you
waiting
parker
jerry
greeted
him
swinging
open
the
cab
door
only
a
minute
or
two
thanks
jerry
for
bringing
the
girls
from
the
boat
may
we
offer
you
a
ride
home
no
thanks
chief
i
walk
from
here
good
evening
jerry
tipped
his
hat
politely
to
penny
and
louise
as
the
cab
drove
away
parker
asked
the
girls
if
they
had
enjoyed
their
trip
aboard
the
the
boat
was
very
well
named
i
afraid
answered
penny
the
trip
proved
to
be
rather
terrible
but
we
met
some
interesting
people
during
the
drive
to
the
sidell
home
she
and
louise
talked
as
fast
as
they
could
telling
parker
about
tillie
fellows
the
mysterious
young
woman
who
had
dropped
a
bundle
of
clothing
into
the
water
and
particularly
the
man
with
the
strange
octopus
tattoo
you
have
to
tell
the
rest
of
it
penny
laughed
louise
as
she
bade
her
chum
thanks
for
bringing
me
home
the
cab
rolled
on
and
penny
glanced
questioningly
at
her
father
what
do
you
think
of
the
tattoo
story
she
asked
hopefully
wo
it
make
a
dandy
feature
for
the
i
regret
to
say
it
sounds
like
fiction
why
dad
louise
and
jerry
will
confirm
everything
i
said
oh
i
do
doubt
your
word
penny
i
am
sure
everything
occurred
as
you
report
nevertheless
were
we
to
use
the
story
our
readers
might
question
its
veracity
do
crush
me
with
such
big
words
dad
veracity
means
truth
penny
now
your
story
is
very
interesting
but
i
think
you
may
have
placed
your
own
interpretation
upon
certain
facts
for
instance
well
according
to
john
munn
statement
he
fell
from
the
bridge
and
was
not
pushed
but
i
saw
it
with
my
own
two
eyes
dad
the
night
is
foggy
you
easily
could
have
been
mistaken
as
for
the
octopus
tattoo
what
is
so
strange
about
it
sailors
compete
in
striving
for
startling
decorative
effects
dad
you
could
rationalize
the
national
debt
accused
penny
very
well
since
you
scorn
my
story
i
give
it
to
the
high
school
paper
an
excellent
idea
that
is
if
your
editor
favors
highly
colored
journalism
penny
made
a
grimace
knowing
that
her
father
was
deliberately
teasing
her
it
was
a
constant
source
of
irritation
that
a
boy
named
fred
clousky
had
been
elected
editor
of
the
riverview
high
school
chatter
instead
of
penny
by
the
margin
of
one
vote
she
disapproved
of
fred
his
pimples
and
particularly
the
way
he
the
occasional
stories
which
she
submitted
the
riverview
high
chatter
is
just
as
silly
as
its
name
she
announced
if
i
had
that
sheet
i
make
it
into
a
real
paper
sour
grapes
inquired
her
father
softly
maybe
grinned
penny
but
fred
is
such
an
egg
even
more
conservative
than
you
the
cab
drew
up
before
the
parker
home
a
light
still
burned
in
the
living
room
where
weems
the
housekeeper
sat
reading
a
magazine
i
am
glad
you
have
come
penny
she
remarked
switching
on
another
light
i
was
beginning
to
worry
since
the
death
of
parker
many
years
before
weems
had
taken
complete
charge
of
the
household
caring
for
penny
and
loving
her
as
her
own
daughter
there
were
occasions
when
she
found
the
impulsive
girl
difficult
to
restrain
but
certainly
never
dull
or
uninteresting
weems
soon
went
to
bed
leaving
penny
and
her
father
to
explore
the
refrigerator
as
they
helped
themselves
to
cold
ham
potato
salad
and
celery
penny
spoke
of
the
light
which
she
had
seen
in
the
abandoned
building
it
may
have
been
a
watchman
making
his
usual
rounds
commented
her
father
jerry
tells
me
the
building
has
no
watchman
could
it
have
been
a
reflection
from
a
car
headlight
i
do
think
so
dad
well
i
should
lose
sleep
over
it
remarked
parker
lightly
better
run
along
to
bed
now
penny
arose
at
the
next
morning
and
before
breakfast
had
written
a
story
about
john
munn
for
the
riverview
high
school
chatter
she
read
it
twice
and
was
very
well
pleased
with
her
work
editor
fred
is
lucky
to
get
this
she
thought
he
should
make
it
the
lead
story
off
to
school
at
a
quarter
to
nine
penny
deposited
her
literary
treasure
in
a
box
provided
for
journalistic
contributions
all
that
day
she
went
from
class
to
class
warmed
by
the
knowledge
that
she
had
accomplished
an
excellent
piece
of
writing
to
louise
she
confided
that
she
thought
the
work
might
improve
her
grade
in
english
composition
i
glad
you
decided
to
contribute
to
the
paper
again
declared
her
chum
it
time
you
and
fred
buried
the
hatchet
oh
i
do
bear
him
any
grudge
returned
penny
of
course
everyone
knows
he
campaigned
for
the
editorship
with
free
candy
and
soda
pop
at
a
minute
before
the
closing
bell
rang
fred
clousky
sauntered
down
the
aisle
with
a
flourish
he
dropped
two
pages
of
copy
on
penny
desk
face
upward
across
one
of
the
pages
in
huge
blue
letters
had
been
written
too
imaginative
for
language
too
flowery
spelling
bad
try
us
again
sometime
a
red
stain
crept
over
penny
cheeks
her
blue
eyes
began
to
snap
the
poisonous
little
mushroom
she
muttered
if
he
thinks
he
can
do
this
to
me
the
closing
bell
rang
and
immediately
a
group
of
sympathetic
friends
gathered
about
penny
they
all
tried
to
soothe
her
feelings
do
let
it
bother
you
louise
advised
her
chum
of
course
he
did
it
just
to
make
you
peeved
bad
penny
read
aloud
look
at
this
word
he
underlined
anyone
could
tell
i
merely
struck
a
wrong
letter
on
my
typewriter
crumpling
the
page
she
tossed
it
into
the
waste
paper
basket
imaginative
she
muttered
too
flowery
oh
forget
it
penny
laughed
louise
leading
her
toward
the
locker
room
fred
always
has
been
jealous
of
you
because
you
had
stories
published
in
the
do
let
him
know
that
you
annoyed
i
guess
i
am
acting
silly
admitted
penny
relaxing
what
i
must
do
is
to
give
this
problem
a
good
hard
think
editor
fred
will
hear
from
me
yet
declining
an
invitation
to
play
tennis
she
went
directly
home
for
an
hour
she
lay
on
the
davenport
staring
at
the
ceiling
penny
are
you
ill
inquired
weems
anxiously
no
i
in
conference
with
myself
answered
penny
i
am
trying
to
arrive
at
a
momentous
decision
presently
she
began
to
scribble
figures
on
a
sheet
of
paper
when
her
father
came
home
at
five
he
found
her
engaged
in
that
occupation
well
penny
he
remarked
hanging
up
his
hat
how
did
it
go
today
the
editor
of
accepted
your
contribution
i
hope
penny
grinned
ruefully
if
you
do
mind
let
discuss
a
less
painful
subject
she
replied
suppose
you
tell
me
what
you
know
about
matthew
judson
and
the
why
this
sudden
display
of
interest
oh
i
saw
judson
last
night
at
the
bean
pot
he
looked
rather
depressed
parker
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
the
davenport
it
too
bad
about
judson
he
remarked
i
always
admired
him
because
he
was
a
clever
newspaper
man
clever
did
he
the
paper
so
that
it
had
to
close
not
that
anyone
ever
learned
no
i
never
could
figure
out
why
judson
quit
the
had
a
large
circulation
and
plenty
of
advertisers
what
became
of
the
building
it
still
there
no
i
mean
who
owns
it
penny
explained
not
mr
judson
the
building
was
taken
over
a
few
months
ago
by
a
man
named
george
veeley
come
to
think
of
it
i
once
brought
him
home
with
me
you
should
remember
him
penny
i
do
he
was
rather
nice
i
wonder
what
he
plans
to
do
with
the
building
and
its
equipment
hold
it
for
speculation
i
assume
in
my
opinion
he
have
it
empty
for
a
long
while
i
rather
doubt
it
said
penny
he
has
a
prospective
tenant
now
only
he
does
know
it
indeed
who
you
looking
at
her
you
parker
smiled
broadly
i
have
it
all
planned
announced
penny
with
quiet
finality
what
this
town
needs
is
a
good
live
newspaper
and
an
imaginative
editor
to
run
it
oh
i
see
with
difficulty
parker
kept
his
face
composed
and
where
do
you
propose
to
start
your
newspaper
in
the
old
building
you
took
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
dad
everything
is
there
awaiting
the
touch
of
my
magic
wand
there
a
little
matter
of
rent
several
thousand
a
month
i
have
a
solution
for
that
problem
your
staff
i
gather
it
as
i
prosper
the
necessary
capital
a
mere
detail
said
penny
grandly
i
meet
only
one
obstacle
at
a
time
tomorrow
i
shall
accost
veeley
with
an
attractive
proposition
if
he
falls
into
my
net
riverview
newest
paper
weekly
makes
its
bow
to
the
public
chapter
and
my
dear
young
lady
do
i
understand
you
correctly
you
are
asking
for
the
use
of
the
building
without
the
payment
of
rent
veeley
slightly
bald
and
with
a
bulging
waistline
regarded
penny
across
the
polished
mahogany
desk
upon
arriving
at
his
office
that
saturday
morning
he
had
found
the
girl
awaiting
him
for
the
past
ten
minutes
she
had
stunned
him
with
her
remarkable
figures
and
plans
yes
that
about
the
size
of
it
penny
acknowledged
what
riverview
needs
is
a
newspaper
unhampered
by
the
conservatism
of
minds
now
you
have
a
fine
building
and
equipment
which
is
standing
idle
fast
falling
into
decay
decay
veeley
inquired
mildly
expensive
machinery
soon
rusts
and
becomes
practically
worthless
unless
kept
in
use
declared
penny
with
authority
if
you
agree
to
my
proposition
i
publish
a
weekly
paper
there
see
that
your
property
is
kept
in
good
condition
and
turn
the
plant
back
to
you
whenever
you
can
find
a
prosperous
renter
your
father
sent
you
here
oh
goodness
no
dad
thinks
it
all
a
great
joke
but
it
is
i
i
can
make
a
success
of
the
paper
if
only
i
have
a
chance
to
test
my
ideas
veeley
could
not
fail
to
be
impressed
by
penny
earnest
appealing
manner
the
novelty
of
her
plan
both
amused
and
intrigued
him
i
wish
i
could
help
you
start
your
paper
he
said
however
i
doubt
if
you
comprehend
the
cost
of
such
a
venture
even
should
i
permit
the
use
of
my
building
rent
free
how
would
you
meet
such
expenses
as
light
water
and
heat
oh
i
have
a
plan
for
everything
insisted
penny
grandly
all
i
need
is
a
building
i
have
the
windows
washed
for
you
and
do
a
good
job
of
house
cleaning
with
me
in
charge
you
be
able
to
dismiss
your
watchman
i
have
one
no
watchman
penny
inquired
innocently
last
night
when
i
drove
past
the
building
i
saw
a
light
on
the
third
floor
evidently
someone
is
prowling
about
there
mr
veeley
you
certain
you
saw
a
light
the
man
inquired
disturbed
by
the
information
oh
yes
indeed
excuse
me
for
advising
you
veeley
but
you
really
should
have
someone
to
guard
your
property
veeley
smiled
broadly
you
are
a
very
convincing
young
lady
while
i
realize
it
is
a
foolish
thing
to
do
i
am
tempted
to
let
you
have
the
key
oh
veeley
that
wonderful
you
never
regret
it
i
allow
you
the
use
of
the
building
for
a
month
resumed
veeley
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
discuss
the
future
penny
was
thrown
into
such
a
frenzy
of
excitement
that
she
scarcely
could
remain
outwardly
serene
until
she
had
left
the
office
once
on
the
street
she
ran
the
entire
distance
to
the
building
dashing
into
her
father
suite
with
all
the
sound
effects
of
a
laboring
steam
engine
dad
she
cried
dramatically
i
have
it
the
key
to
the
plant
now
i
on
my
way
to
draw
my
savings
from
the
bank
what
that
demanded
parker
do
tell
me
veeley
listened
to
your
crazy
scheme
he
heartily
in
favor
of
it
dad
now
i
must
rush
off
to
the
bank
come
back
here
her
father
commanded
as
she
started
for
the
door
i
ca
allow
you
to
withdraw
your
savings
how
can
i
launch
the
without
capital
you
really
determined
to
try
it
of
course
parker
reached
for
a
cheque
book
how
much
will
you
need
oh
just
sign
your
name
at
the
bottom
and
leave
the
amount
blank
sorry
i
prefer
not
to
financially
cripple
myself
for
life
one
hundred
dollars
is
my
limit
i
throwing
it
down
a
but
the
lessons
you
learn
may
be
worth
the
cost
i
can
do
a
lot
with
a
hundred
dollars
said
penny
thanks
dad
she
picked
up
the
cheque
before
the
ink
was
dry
and
dropping
a
kiss
lightly
on
her
father
cheek
was
gone
from
the
corner
drugstore
penny
telephoned
louise
telling
her
the
news
and
asking
her
to
come
downtown
at
once
fifteen
minutes
later
her
chum
met
her
at
the
entrance
to
the
building
just
think
lou
she
murmured
unlocking
the
front
door
this
huge
plant
all
mine
i
a
publisher
at
last
you
completely
insane
if
you
ask
me
retorted
louise
this
place
is
a
dreadful
mess
you
never
be
able
to
clean
it
up
let
alone
get
out
an
issue
of
the
paper
the
girls
had
passed
through
the
vestibule
to
the
lower
floor
room
which
once
had
served
as
the
circulation
department
behind
the
high
service
counter
desks
and
chairs
remained
untouched
covered
by
a
thick
layer
of
dust
cobwebs
hung
from
the
ceiling
light
fixtures
and
festooned
the
walls
climbing
the
stairs
the
girls
glanced
briefly
into
the
newsroom
and
then
wandered
on
to
the
composing
room
penny
gaze
roved
over
long
rows
of
linotype
machines
and
steel
trucks
which
were
used
to
hold
page
forms
there
were
bins
of
type
cheltenham
goudy
century
more
varieties
than
she
had
ever
seen
before
passing
the
stereotyping
department
the
girls
entered
the
press
room
where
slumbered
ten
giant
rotary
presses
lying
on
the
roller
of
one
was
a
torn
strip
of
newspaper
the
last
issue
of
the
ever
printed
it
gives
one
a
queer
feeling
to
see
all
this
said
louise
why
do
you
suppose
judson
closed
the
plant
when
it
was
prosperous
no
one
seems
to
know
the
answer
penny
replied
stooping
to
peer
into
an
empty
ink
pot
but
it
does
seem
possible
a
man
would
give
up
his
business
throw
so
many
persons
out
of
work
without
a
good
reason
his
bad
luck
seems
to
be
yours
louise
remarked
gloomily
well
since
you
fallen
heir
to
all
this
what
will
you
do
with
it
it
will
take
a
sizeable
chunk
of
your
hundred
dollars
just
to
get
the
place
cleaned
not
according
to
my
calculations
chuckled
penny
let
choose
our
offices
and
then
we
discuss
business
our
offices
echoed
louise
i
not
in
on
this
of
yours
oh
yes
you
are
you
be
the
editor
but
i
thought
you
were
that
i
be
the
managing
editor
said
penny
gently
you
have
your
office
and
oodles
of
authority
of
course
you
have
to
work
hard
keeping
our
staff
in
line
what
staff
we
recruit
from
riverview
high
concentrating
on
the
journalism
majors
now
i
think
jack
malone
will
be
our
new
advertising
manager
jack
malone
why
penny
he
has
an
ounce
of
push
i
know
lou
but
his
father
is
president
of
the
malone
glass
company
i
figure
if
his
son
is
in
charge
of
advertising
i
get
the
idea
interrupted
louise
penny
with
a
head
like
yours
we
should
land
all
the
important
accounts
in
town
i
aim
to
win
several
fat
ones
away
from
the
penny
said
with
quiet
confidence
if
we
do
it
will
be
bankruptcy
before
the
first
issue
of
the
paper
is
off
the
press
louise
glanced
dubiously
at
the
dusty
machinery
there
no
denying
you
a
genius
penny
even
so
i
do
see
how
you
expect
to
get
these
presses
running
we
only
need
one
true
but
you
ca
recruit
pressmen
or
linotype
operators
from
riverview
high
unfortunately
no
sighed
penny
the
first
issue
of
the
will
be
printed
at
the
plant
dad
does
know
it
yet
after
that
well
i
think
of
something
how
do
you
propose
to
get
this
place
cleaned
every
person
who
works
on
our
paper
must
wield
a
broom
lou
after
chosen
our
offices
we
scamper
forth
and
gather
our
staff
together
returning
to
the
second
floor
the
girls
inspected
the
offices
adjoining
the
newsroom
penny
selected
for
hers
the
one
which
previously
had
been
occupied
by
matthew
judson
his
name
remained
on
the
door
and
the
walls
bore
etchings
and
paintings
of
considerable
value
in
the
top
drawer
of
the
desk
there
remained
an
assortment
of
pens
erasers
thumbtacks
and
small
articles
all
letters
and
papers
had
been
removed
judson
apparently
left
here
in
a
great
hurry
she
remarked
for
some
reason
he
never
returned
for
the
paintings
and
personal
trifles
louise
chose
an
office
adjoining
penny
new
quarters
they
both
were
admiring
the
view
from
the
window
when
her
chum
suddenly
drew
herself
into
an
attitude
of
attention
what
wrong
inquired
louise
mystified
i
thought
i
heard
someone
moving
about
whispered
penny
quiet
they
remained
motionless
listening
a
board
creaked
darting
to
the
door
penny
flung
it
open
the
newsroom
was
deserted
but
she
was
almost
certain
she
heard
footsteps
retreating
swiftly
down
the
hall
lou
we
not
alone
in
this
building
i
thought
i
heard
someone
too
the
girls
ran
through
the
newsroom
to
the
hall
and
down
the
stairway
three
steps
from
the
bottom
penny
suddenly
halted
on
the
service
counter
of
the
advertising
department
lay
a
man
grimy
felt
hat
look
at
that
she
whispered
someone
upstairs
he
may
still
be
here
too
penny
did
you
leave
the
entrance
door
unlocked
i
guess
so
i
do
remember
a
loiterer
may
have
wandered
into
the
building
and
then
left
when
we
gave
chase
without
his
hat
it
probably
was
forgotten
anyhow
i
intend
to
look
carefully
about
declared
penny
after
all
i
am
responsible
for
this
place
now
both
girls
were
uneasy
as
they
wandered
from
room
to
room
penny
even
ventured
into
the
basement
where
a
number
of
rats
had
taken
refuge
the
building
seemed
deserted
we
only
wasting
precious
time
she
said
at
last
whoever
the
intruder
was
he
gone
now
retracing
their
way
to
the
advertising
department
the
girls
stopped
short
staring
at
the
counter
the
hat
observed
there
only
a
few
minutes
before
had
vanished
chapter
and
penny
and
louise
stared
at
the
counter
unable
to
believe
their
eyesight
they
knew
that
they
had
not
touched
the
hat
obviously
it
had
been
removed
by
the
man
who
had
left
it
there
the
hat
gone
whispered
louise
nervously
that
means
someone
is
still
inside
the
building
he
could
have
slipped
out
the
front
door
while
we
were
in
the
basement
once
more
the
girls
made
a
complete
tour
of
the
building
entering
every
room
unable
to
find
an
intruder
they
finally
decided
to
give
up
the
futile
search
after
this
i
take
care
to
lock
the
door
declared
penny
as
they
prepared
to
leave
the
building
now
let
get
busy
and
gather
our
staff
during
the
next
hour
she
and
louise
motored
from
house
to
house
recruiting
school
friends
early
afternoon
found
the
old
building
invaded
by
a
crew
of
willing
and
enthusiastic
young
workers
a
group
of
fifteen
boys
and
girls
armed
with
mops
window
cloths
and
brooms
fell
to
work
with
such
vigor
that
by
nightfall
the
main
portion
of
the
building
had
emerged
from
its
cocoon
of
grime
weary
but
well
satisfied
with
her
first
day
as
a
newspaper
publisher
penny
went
home
and
to
bed
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
she
ate
with
such
a
preoccupied
air
that
her
father
commented
upon
her
sober
countenance
i
hope
you
have
encountered
knotty
problems
so
soon
in
your
journalistic
venture
he
remarked
teasingly
none
which
you
ca
solve
for
me
said
penny
i
decided
to
run
the
octopus
tattoo
story
on
the
front
page
of
our
first
issue
indeed
and
when
does
the
first
issue
appear
i
print
one
week
from
today
a
sunday
paper
i
thought
probably
your
presses
would
be
busy
on
that
day
presses
yes
i
have
hired
my
pressroom
force
yet
i
plan
to
make
up
the
paper
set
the
type
and
lock
it
in
the
page
forms
then
i
haul
it
over
to
your
plant
for
stereotyping
and
the
press
run
and
if
i
object
you
wo
will
you
dad
i
such
a
pathetic
little
competitor
i
run
off
the
first
edition
for
you
parker
promised
but
mind
only
the
first
how
many
papers
will
you
want
about
five
hundred
oh
roughly
six
thousand
that
should
take
care
of
my
street
sales
parker
fork
clattered
against
his
plate
your
street
sales
he
repeated
where
may
i
ask
did
you
acquire
your
distribution
organization
oh
i
have
plans
penny
chuckled
running
a
paper
is
really
very
simple
young
lady
you
riding
for
a
heartbreaking
fall
warned
her
father
severely
six
thousand
copies
why
you
be
lucky
to
dispose
of
three
hundred
wait
and
see
said
penny
confidently
during
the
week
which
followed
there
were
no
idle
moments
for
the
staff
of
the
newly
organized
leaving
louise
in
charge
of
the
news
output
penny
concentrated
most
of
her
attention
on
the
problem
of
winning
advertisers
starting
with
a
page
taken
by
the
malone
glass
company
she
and
jack
malone
toured
the
city
selling
a
total
of
full
columns
the
novelty
of
the
enterprise
intrigued
many
business
men
while
others
took
space
because
they
were
friends
of
malone
or
parker
money
continued
to
pour
into
the
till
of
the
yet
when
everything
should
have
been
sailing
along
smoothly
louise
complained
that
it
was
becoming
difficult
to
keep
her
staff
of
writers
satisfied
one
by
one
they
were
falling
away
we
must
expect
that
declared
penny
always
the
weak
drop
by
the
wayside
if
only
we
can
get
on
a
paying
basis
we
be
able
to
offer
small
salaries
then
we
have
more
workers
than
we
can
use
you
certainly
look
to
the
future
laughed
louise
personally
i
have
grave
doubts
we
ever
get
the
first
issue
set
up
every
moment
which
could
be
spared
from
school
penny
spent
at
the
plant
long
after
the
other
young
people
had
left
she
remained
trying
to
master
the
intricacies
of
the
linotype
machine
although
in
theory
it
operated
somewhat
like
a
typewriter
she
could
not
learn
to
set
type
accurately
friday
night
alone
in
the
building
the
task
suddenly
overwhelmed
her
machines
machines
machines
she
muttered
the
paper
is
going
to
be
a
mess
and
all
because
i
ca
run
this
hateful
old
thing
dropping
her
head
wearily
on
the
keyboard
penny
wept
with
vexation
suddenly
she
stiffened
unmistakably
footsteps
were
coming
softly
down
the
hall
toward
the
composing
room
twice
during
the
week
louise
had
declared
that
she
believed
someone
prowled
about
the
plant
when
it
was
deserted
penny
had
been
too
busy
to
worry
about
the
matter
but
now
realizing
that
she
was
alone
and
without
protection
her
pulse
began
to
hammer
a
shadow
fell
across
the
doorway
who
who
is
there
penny
called
her
voice
unsteady
to
her
relief
a
young
man
his
bashful
grin
reassuringly
familiar
stepped
into
the
cavernous
room
bill
carlyle
was
one
of
her
best
linotype
operators
you
nearly
startled
me
out
of
my
wits
she
laughed
shakily
what
brought
you
here
bill
i
noticed
the
light
burning
the
operator
replied
twisting
his
hat
in
his
hands
i
thought
i
would
drop
in
and
see
how
you
were
getting
along
why
that
nice
of
you
bill
penny
saw
that
he
was
gazing
hard
at
her
she
was
afraid
he
could
tell
that
she
had
been
crying
the
boys
say
you
doing
right
well
bill
moved
nearer
the
linotype
machine
do
look
at
my
work
pleaded
penny
it
simply
awful
i
ca
get
the
hang
of
this
horrid
old
machine
i
wish
i
had
started
a
newspaper
i
must
have
been
crazy
just
as
everyone
says
you
tired
that
what
the
trouble
said
bill
soothingly
now
there
nothing
to
running
a
linotype
give
me
a
piece
of
copy
and
show
you
he
slid
into
the
vacant
chair
and
his
fingers
began
to
move
over
the
keyboard
as
if
by
magic
type
fell
into
place
and
there
were
no
mistakes
you
do
it
marvelously
said
penny
admiringly
what
the
trick
about
ten
years
practice
shoot
out
your
copy
now
and
i
set
some
of
it
for
you
bill
you
a
darling
but
dare
you
do
it
what
about
the
union
this
is
just
between
you
and
me
he
grinned
you
need
a
helping
hand
and
i
here
to
give
it
until
midnight
bill
remained
at
his
post
setting
more
type
in
three
hours
than
penny
had
done
in
three
days
your
front
page
should
look
pretty
good
at
any
rate
he
said
as
they
left
the
building
together
using
rather
old
stories
though
you
old
that
one
about
the
man
who
was
pushed
off
the
bridge
the
story
is
still
news
penny
said
defensively
no
other
paper
has
used
it
did
you
like
it
sure
it
was
good
he
responded
now
that
several
days
had
elapsed
since
her
experience
at
the
river
even
penny
interest
in
john
munn
and
his
strange
tattoo
had
faded
however
she
was
determined
that
the
story
should
appear
in
the
paper
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
plague
the
editor
of
according
to
a
report
from
louise
fred
clousky
had
called
at
the
early
that
afternoon
and
had
seemed
very
gloomy
as
he
inspected
the
plant
he
had
spent
nearly
a
half
hour
in
the
composing
room
a
fact
which
penny
later
was
to
recall
with
chagrin
poor
fred
she
thought
after
my
paper
comes
out
his
will
look
more
than
ever
like
a
sick
cat
saturday
was
another
day
of
toil
but
by
six
aided
by
the
few
faithful
members
of
her
staff
the
last
stick
of
type
was
set
the
pages
locked
and
transported
to
the
ready
for
the
sunday
morning
run
i
be
here
early
tomorrow
penny
told
the
pressman
do
start
the
edition
rolling
until
i
arrive
i
want
to
press
the
button
myself
at
her
urging
parker
jerry
livingston
salt
sommers
and
many
members
of
the
staff
came
to
view
the
stereotyped
plates
waiting
to
be
fitted
on
the
press
rollers
you
done
well
penny
praised
her
father
i
confess
i
never
thought
you
would
get
this
far
still
figuring
on
a
street
sale
of
six
thousand
i
increased
the
number
to
seven
laughed
penny
and
how
do
you
plan
to
get
the
papers
sold
oh
that
my
secret
dad
you
may
be
surprised
exhausted
but
happy
penny
went
home
and
to
bed
she
was
up
at
six
and
after
a
hastily
eaten
breakfast
arrived
at
the
office
in
time
to
greet
the
workmen
who
were
just
coming
on
duty
everything
is
set
the
foreman
told
her
presently
you
can
start
the
press
now
penny
was
so
nervous
that
her
hand
trembled
as
she
pressed
the
electric
switch
there
was
a
low
whining
noise
as
the
wheels
began
to
turn
slowly
at
first
then
faster
and
faster
pressmen
moved
back
and
forth
oiling
the
machinery
and
tightening
screws
penny
gaze
was
upon
the
long
stream
of
paper
feeding
into
the
press
in
a
moment
the
neatly
folded
newspapers
would
slide
out
at
the
rate
of
eight
hundred
a
minute
only
slightly
over
an
hour
and
the
run
would
be
completed
the
first
printed
paper
dropped
from
the
press
and
the
foreman
reached
for
it
here
you
are
he
said
offering
it
to
penny
almost
reverently
she
accepted
the
paper
even
though
there
were
only
eight
pages
each
one
represented
hours
of
labor
she
had
turned
out
a
professional
job
and
could
rightly
feel
proud
and
then
suddenly
penny
eyes
fell
upon
the
uppermost
line
of
the
front
page
she
gasped
and
leaned
against
the
wall
i
ruined
she
moaned
ruined
someone
has
played
a
cruel
joke
on
me
why
what
wrong
inquired
the
press
foreman
reaching
for
another
paper
look
at
this
wailed
penny
just
look
she
pointed
to
the
name
of
the
paper
printed
in
large
black
letters
it
read
the
weakly
times
i
be
the
laughing
stock
of
riverview
penny
moaned
the
papers
ca
go
out
that
way
stop
the
press
chapter
as
the
foreman
turned
off
the
rotarypress
the
loud
throb
of
machinery
died
away
and
the
flowing
web
of
paper
became
motionless
how
could
the
mistake
have
been
made
penny
murmured
disconsolately
i
know
that
originally
the
was
set
up
right
you
should
have
taken
page
proofs
and
checked
the
mat
said
the
foreman
but
i
did
at
least
i
took
page
proofs
i
admit
i
was
careless
about
the
mats
well
it
looks
as
if
someone
played
a
joke
on
you
replied
the
foreman
penny
face
hardened
i
can
guess
who
did
it
fred
clousky
louise
told
me
he
spent
a
long
while
in
the
composing
room
one
afternoon
while
i
was
away
he
must
have
changed
the
type
just
to
make
me
look
ridiculous
well
it
done
anyway
said
the
foreman
with
a
shrug
what
will
you
do
about
the
run
i
never
let
it
go
through
this
way
i
rather
die
the
foreman
reminded
penny
that
with
paid
advertisements
she
would
be
compelled
to
print
an
issue
she
knew
that
it
would
not
be
possible
to
make
a
change
in
the
starter
plate
the
entire
page
must
be
recast
i
do
suppose
the
type
can
be
matched
in
this
plant
she
said
gloomily
we
may
have
some
like
it
replied
the
foreman
i
see
soon
he
returned
to
report
that
type
was
available
and
that
the
work
could
be
done
by
the
stereotypers
however
the
men
would
expect
overtime
pay
i
give
them
anything
they
want
said
penny
recklessly
anything
after
a
trying
wait
the
new
plate
was
made
ready
and
locked
on
the
cylinder
once
more
the
great
press
thundered
again
papers
began
to
pour
from
the
machine
every
fiftieth
one
slightly
out
of
line
what
do
you
want
done
with
inquired
the
foreman
have
the
papers
carried
to
the
mailing
room
and
stacked
by
the
door
she
instructed
i
be
around
in
the
morning
to
arrange
for
deliveries
monday
first
issue
of
the
was
hot
off
the
press
when
penny
stationed
herself
beside
the
veritable
mountain
of
papers
the
room
was
a
bedlam
with
newsboys
shouting
noisily
for
their
wares
as
they
passed
her
on
their
way
to
the
street
she
waylaid
them
one
by
one
here
you
are
boys
she
said
with
an
expansive
smile
two
dozen
papers
each
sell
them
for
a
nickel
and
keep
half
of
it
for
yourself
turn
in
the
money
at
the
office
two
and
a
half
cents
exclaimed
one
of
the
boys
gee
that
more
than
we
get
for
selling
the
generosity
is
my
motto
laughed
penny
just
push
those
papers
for
all
you
worth
leaving
the
plant
she
went
directly
to
the
building
permission
had
been
granted
to
absent
herself
from
school
and
she
planned
to
be
busy
throughout
the
day
checking
on
paper
sales
as
penny
unlocked
the
front
door
she
noticed
that
a
faint
odor
of
tobacco
lingered
in
the
air
a
perplexed
frown
knitted
her
brow
that
funny
she
thought
none
of
the
boys
are
allowed
to
smoke
here
i
wonder
if
someone
disobeyed
rules
or
if
there
really
a
prowler
in
the
building
too
busy
to
search
the
plant
again
penny
gave
the
matter
scant
consideration
tossing
a
package
of
lunch
on
the
counter
she
prepared
for
a
hard
day
work
now
and
then
to
rest
her
mind
from
columns
of
figures
she
wandered
to
the
window
down
the
street
newsboys
called
their
wares
and
it
pleased
her
that
they
shouted
the
as
frequently
as
they
did
the
by
ten
the
boys
began
to
straggle
in
with
their
money
only
a
few
had
failed
to
sell
all
of
their
papers
and
not
one
neglected
to
make
a
report
penny
final
disclosed
that
six
thousand
eight
hundred
and
weeklies
had
been
sold
i
ca
expect
to
do
that
well
after
the
novelty
wears
off
she
thought
but
one
thing
is
assured
my
is
going
to
be
with
a
large
sum
of
money
in
her
possession
penny
decided
to
take
no
chance
of
losing
it
after
making
a
careful
count
she
poured
the
coins
into
a
bag
which
she
transported
by
car
to
the
bank
it
was
when
she
returned
to
the
plant
she
went
to
the
counter
for
the
package
of
sandwiches
to
her
surprise
it
had
disappeared
now
who
took
my
food
she
muttered
penny
was
annoyed
she
did
not
believe
that
one
of
the
newsboys
had
picked
up
the
package
accumulative
evidence
pointed
to
a
likelihood
that
someone
was
hiding
in
the
building
the
moving
light
tobacco
smoke
unexplained
footsteps
suggested
that
a
tramp
might
be
using
the
empty
plant
as
a
comfortable
shelter
but
how
can
he
get
in
she
asked
herself
doors
and
windows
are
kept
locked
as
penny
considered
whether
or
not
to
report
the
matter
to
police
the
front
door
opened
a
man
of
early
middle
age
well
dressed
but
with
a
sharp
face
and
a
nose
entered
this
the
office
of
the
he
demanded
grumpily
yes
said
penny
is
there
anything
i
want
to
see
the
editor
you
looking
at
her
now
you
a
girl
penny
smiled
and
waited
the
stranger
hesitated
and
then
took
the
from
his
overcoat
pocket
with
his
forefinger
he
jabbed
at
a
story
on
the
front
page
penny
account
of
the
tattooed
man
who
had
been
pushed
from
the
bridge
you
know
who
wrote
this
he
questioned
i
did
again
penny
words
surprised
the
man
although
he
tried
not
to
disclose
it
that
a
right
interesting
yarn
he
said
after
a
long
pause
i
glad
you
like
it
penny
stared
at
the
man
with
interest
wondering
why
he
had
come
and
what
he
wanted
i
was
kind
of
curious
to
know
where
you
got
your
information
why
i
saw
it
happen
mr
i
do
believe
you
told
me
your
name
fenestra
peter
fenestra
i
was
driving
near
the
bridge
at
the
time
the
man
was
pushed
into
the
water
penny
resumed
you
did
see
the
one
who
did
it
not
clearly
may
i
ask
why
you
are
so
interested
in
the
story
i
thought
maybe
i
knew
that
man
munn
what
became
of
him
i
ca
tell
you
that
he
was
rescued
by
a
tugboat
captain
everything
i
know
about
the
affair
is
in
the
story
well
thank
you
kindly
fenestra
said
tipping
his
hat
penny
watched
him
leave
the
office
and
walk
to
his
car
she
had
never
seen
the
man
before
to
her
knowledge
although
she
should
have
felt
flattered
by
his
visit
it
left
her
with
a
vague
unexplainable
sensation
of
distrust
there
something
queer
about
the
way
he
came
here
she
reflected
perhaps
he
knows
more
than
he
pretended
penny
soon
dismissed
the
matter
from
her
mind
turning
her
thoughts
to
the
problem
of
the
missing
lunch
resolutely
she
made
a
tour
of
the
building
venturing
everywhere
save
into
the
basement
as
she
had
half
expected
she
found
no
one
however
returning
once
more
to
her
work
she
occasionally
caught
herself
listening
for
footsteps
at
louise
came
from
school
with
other
members
of
the
staff
she
and
penny
retired
to
the
latter
private
office
there
to
discuss
plans
for
the
next
week
paper
lou
said
penny
abruptly
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
man
named
peter
fenestra
why
yes
i
have
he
was
here
today
to
ask
me
about
the
octopus
tattoo
story
what
can
you
tell
me
not
very
much
penny
he
lives
on
a
farm
two
miles
from
the
south
edge
of
riverview
a
place
called
the
willows
oh
is
he
a
farmer
penny
was
surprised
i
never
would
have
guessed
that
he
is
one
he
merely
lives
there
according
to
the
report
he
has
prospered
by
leaps
and
bounds
how
does
he
make
his
money
no
one
seems
to
know
when
fenestra
came
here
a
year
or
so
ago
he
appear
to
have
anything
lately
he
bought
a
fine
car
and
he
spends
money
rather
lavishly
he
inquired
about
john
munn
penny
remarked
somehow
i
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
trying
to
pump
information
from
me
for
a
particular
reason
those
who
know
fenestra
say
he
a
sly
old
fox
that
the
way
he
impressed
me
lou
perhaps
i
flatter
myself
but
i
believe
my
tattoo
story
may
cause
quite
a
stir
in
riverview
was
fenestra
annoyed
by
it
i
think
so
lou
although
he
tried
to
cover
his
feelings
he
may
or
may
not
be
a
friend
of
john
munn
but
he
certainly
was
anxious
to
learn
what
became
of
him
you
did
ask
him
any
questions
no
his
visit
took
me
by
surprise
but
i
been
thinking
lou
i
very
much
want
a
follow
up
story
on
john
munn
for
next
week
paper
suppose
we
run
out
to
fenestra
farm
tomorrow
what
purpose
would
there
be
in
that
fenestra
may
be
able
to
tell
us
interesting
facts
which
will
throw
light
on
the
mystery
he
may
understand
the
significance
of
the
octopus
tattoo
you
rather
hopeful
i
think
but
you
go
with
me
yes
promised
louise
i
always
had
a
curiosity
to
see
the
willows
besides
i
need
a
vacation
from
my
strenuous
duties
as
editor
chapter
storm
well
penny
remarked
parker
casually
at
the
breakfast
table
i
finally
bought
the
cottage
penny
closed
her
history
book
with
a
loud
snap
favoring
her
father
with
complete
attention
you
bought
a
cottage
she
echoed
where
when
why
i
talked
about
it
for
the
past
week
but
you
were
so
busy
stealing
the
advertisers
that
you
never
listened
i
all
ears
now
dad
penny
assured
him
absently
reaching
for
a
piece
of
toast
tell
me
all
about
it
the
cottage
is
located
on
the
big
bear
river
four
rooms
and
a
boathouse
incidentally
i
hired
a
man
to
look
after
the
place
and
keep
the
boat
in
shape
he
calls
himself
anchor
joe
are
we
going
to
live
at
the
cottage
this
summer
penny
inquired
no
i
merely
bought
it
for
trips
i
plan
on
a
bit
of
fishing
now
and
then
you
may
enjoy
going
with
me
oh
dad
groaned
penny
how
can
i
these
days
i
do
even
have
time
to
wash
my
neck
running
a
newspaper
is
more
work
than
i
figured
i
give
you
the
address
of
the
cottage
at
least
smiled
parker
if
you
have
any
spare
time
during
the
next
three
months
drive
out
and
look
over
the
place
i
get
there
somehow
penny
promised
pocketing
the
card
her
hand
encountered
a
typed
folded
sheet
of
paper
which
she
immediately
placed
in
front
of
her
father
oh
by
the
way
sign
this
for
me
will
you
no
more
cheques
this
is
only
an
order
for
a
of
paper
i
trying
to
store
up
a
few
supplies
so
that
eventually
i
can
publish
the
in
my
own
plant
parker
signed
the
order
inquiring
teasingly
have
you
engaged
your
pressman
yet
their
wages
come
rather
high
you
know
it
takes
everything
the
makes
to
meet
its
current
bills
sighed
penny
but
one
of
these
days
i
get
the
paper
out
in
my
own
plant
just
wait
and
see
i
wait
chuckled
parker
my
hope
is
that
you
do
fail
in
your
studies
before
that
happy
day
arrives
on
her
way
to
school
penny
studied
the
card
given
her
by
her
father
and
noticed
that
the
new
cottage
was
situated
not
far
from
the
willows
often
she
and
louise
had
talked
of
calling
upon
peter
fenestra
but
both
had
been
kept
busy
at
the
office
now
that
a
linotype
operator
had
been
hired
to
set
type
they
had
a
little
more
free
time
if
louise
will
accompany
me
i
visit
both
places
tonight
decided
penny
found
the
two
girls
walking
through
a
dense
maple
and
oak
woods
which
rimmed
the
big
bear
river
a
breeze
stirred
the
tree
leaves
but
even
so
the
day
was
hot
and
sultry
i
wish
it
would
rain
remarked
louise
trudging
wearily
beside
her
companion
i
never
knew
it
to
be
so
warm
at
this
time
of
year
maybe
we
can
cool
off
by
taking
a
boat
ride
when
we
get
to
the
cottage
encouraged
penny
i
think
i
see
the
place
through
the
trees
directly
ahead
in
a
tiny
clearing
stood
a
freshly
painted
white
cottage
quickening
their
steps
the
girls
soon
arrived
at
the
front
door
no
one
seemed
to
be
within
call
so
they
pushed
it
open
a
long
living
room
with
a
cobblestone
fireplace
met
their
gaze
beyond
was
the
kitchen
a
dining
alcove
and
two
bedrooms
as
they
went
outside
again
they
saw
a
short
wiry
man
coming
toward
the
cottage
from
the
river
you
miss
parker
he
asked
looking
at
louise
no
am
corrected
penny
and
you
must
be
anchor
joe
her
eyes
fastened
for
an
instant
upon
the
tattoo
of
a
sailing
ship
imprinted
on
his
arm
that
me
agreed
the
man
go
ahead
an
look
around
all
you
like
penny
and
louise
wandered
about
the
grounds
then
returned
to
find
anchor
joe
giving
the
motor
boat
which
was
upturned
on
the
grass
a
coat
of
varnish
we
thought
you
might
take
us
for
a
ride
remarked
penny
it
must
be
cool
on
the
water
i
sure
would
like
to
miss
parker
said
anchor
joe
regretfully
but
i
das
get
wet
now
not
until
this
varnish
dries
penny
nodded
and
then
asked
you
a
sailor
are
you
where
have
you
sailed
the
atlantic
the
great
lakes
the
gulf
o
mexico
oh
i
been
everywhere
penny
and
louise
chatted
with
anchor
joe
for
a
time
but
although
they
asked
any
number
of
questions
they
gained
very
little
definite
information
the
sailor
seemed
unwilling
to
tell
anything
about
himself
save
in
generalities
we
may
as
well
go
on
to
peter
fenestra
place
penny
presently
remarked
it
getting
late
anchor
joe
varnish
brush
became
motionless
he
glanced
up
with
sudden
interest
i
would
go
there
if
i
was
you
gals
he
said
why
not
questioned
penny
in
astonishment
the
weather
do
look
so
good
she
might
blow
up
a
gale
before
sundown
oh
we
not
afraid
of
a
little
wind
or
rain
answered
penny
carelessly
come
along
lou
anchor
joe
said
nothing
more
but
his
sober
gaze
followed
the
girls
as
they
walked
away
keeping
close
to
the
river
penny
and
louise
trod
a
path
which
they
knew
would
lead
to
the
main
road
and
peter
fenestra
farm
queer
sort
was
he
penny
remarked
thoughtfully
anchor
joe
yes
i
wonder
where
dad
found
him
he
certainly
did
tell
us
much
about
himself
crossing
the
river
by
means
of
a
swaying
suspension
bridge
the
girls
came
out
from
beneath
the
solid
canopy
of
trees
penny
paused
to
stare
up
at
the
sky
are
those
clouds
odd
she
observed
just
watch
them
boil
they
must
be
filled
with
wind
declared
louise
uneasily
anchor
joe
said
he
thought
a
storm
would
blow
up
it
not
far
away
either
unless
we
step
right
along
we
surely
get
caught
in
it
perhaps
we
should
forget
the
willows
and
start
home
we
never
could
get
there
now
responded
penny
if
we
hurry
we
may
reach
fenestra
place
before
the
storm
breaks
walking
even
faster
the
girls
hastened
along
the
winding
path
the
air
remained
sultry
and
very
still
the
sky
penny
noted
had
changed
to
a
peculiar
yellowish
color
then
as
she
watched
with
increasing
alarm
a
writhing
twisting
arm
reached
down
from
the
boiling
clouds
anchoring
them
to
earth
for
a
moment
the
entire
mass
seemed
to
settle
and
flatten
out
listen
commanded
penny
plainly
they
both
could
hear
a
sullen
roar
as
the
storm
moved
forward
a
tornado
gasped
louise
it
coming
this
way
run
urged
penny
seizing
her
hand
we
still
have
a
chance
to
make
fenestra
place
in
a
clearing
beyond
a
field
stood
a
white
farmhouse
a
red
barn
and
a
silo
one
side
of
the
property
was
bounded
by
the
river
the
other
by
the
road
crawling
beneath
a
fence
the
girls
cut
across
the
field
the
sky
was
darker
now
the
roar
of
the
wind
ominous
they
could
see
the
tail
of
the
funnel
whipping
along
the
ground
veering
to
the
south
then
coming
toward
them
again
we
never
make
the
house
louise
cried
fearfully
yes
we
will
encouraged
penny
she
raised
another
wire
strand
for
louise
to
roll
beneath
her
own
sweater
caught
on
the
sharp
barbs
tearing
a
large
hole
as
she
jerked
free
dust
had
begun
to
blow
trees
and
bushes
bowed
before
the
first
gusts
of
wind
glancing
frantically
about
for
a
place
of
refuge
penny
saw
a
low
circular
cement
hump
rising
from
the
ground
not
many
yards
distant
instantly
she
recognized
it
as
an
old
fashioned
storm
cellar
we
get
in
there
lou
she
shouted
come
on
running
across
the
yard
they
reached
the
cave
entrance
was
guarded
by
a
door
built
in
the
side
of
the
cement
dome
a
brass
padlock
hung
unsnapped
in
the
hasp
thank
goodness
we
can
get
in
gasped
louise
hurry
penny
tugged
at
the
heavy
door
it
would
not
raise
and
then
it
gave
so
suddenly
that
she
nearly
tumbled
backwards
the
door
clattered
back
against
the
cement
dome
through
the
rectangular
opening
protruded
the
head
and
shoulders
of
peter
fenestra
his
face
was
convulsed
with
rage
what
are
you
trying
to
do
he
demanded
harshly
speak
up
chapter
fallen
speak
up
peter
fenestra
commanded
again
as
the
girls
stared
at
him
in
blank
astonishment
why
are
you
trying
to
get
into
my
cave
listen
to
that
wind
cried
penny
recovering
the
power
of
speech
she
pointed
toward
the
sky
a
tornado
exclaimed
fenestra
in
a
stunned
voice
and
it
coming
this
way
added
louise
let
us
down
into
the
cave
instead
of
stepping
aside
the
man
came
up
the
stone
steps
slamming
the
door
of
the
cave
he
padlocked
it
quick
into
the
house
he
ordered
we
be
much
safer
underground
argued
penny
that
twister
easily
can
lift
a
building
from
its
foundation
do
as
i
say
commanded
peter
fenestra
harshly
the
cave
is
half
filled
with
water
you
ca
go
down
there
deserting
the
girls
he
ran
toward
the
house
mystified
by
the
old
actions
penny
and
louise
followed
overtaking
him
as
he
reached
the
porch
get
inside
he
ordered
the
girls
scurried
through
the
door
and
he
closed
it
behind
them
barely
had
they
reached
shelter
when
the
wind
struck
the
house
in
full
force
fairly
shaking
it
to
its
foundation
windows
rattled
a
tree
bough
came
crashing
down
on
the
porch
the
air
was
filled
with
flying
debris
as
a
hard
object
shattered
a
pane
of
glass
penny
and
louise
heard
a
terrified
scream
from
the
kitchen
a
moment
later
a
girl
ran
into
the
room
she
stopped
short
as
she
saw
penny
and
louise
they
also
stared
for
it
was
tillie
fellows
stop
that
silly
screeching
fenestra
ordered
sharply
the
center
of
the
storm
is
passing
to
the
south
now
get
back
to
your
work
yes
sir
tillie
mumbled
still
gazing
at
penny
and
louise
she
slowly
retreated
however
as
peter
fenestra
went
to
the
window
turning
his
back
she
made
strange
signs
to
the
girls
which
they
were
unable
to
understand
obviously
she
did
not
wish
them
to
speak
to
her
for
she
raised
a
finger
to
her
lips
indicative
of
silence
a
gate
was
wrenched
from
its
hinges
and
carried
across
the
yard
from
across
the
road
came
the
crash
of
an
uprooted
tree
with
a
stifled
scream
tillie
fled
to
the
kitchen
that
stupid
girl
drives
me
crazy
fenestra
muttered
i
do
know
why
i
ever
hired
her
you
ca
blame
her
for
being
frightened
declared
louise
quickly
this
is
a
dreadful
storm
the
worst
is
over
now
said
fenestra
you
be
able
to
go
in
a
few
minutes
penny
and
louise
glanced
at
each
other
peter
fenestra
remark
made
it
very
clear
that
he
did
not
wish
them
to
linger
after
the
storm
had
passed
without
inviting
them
to
sit
down
he
nervously
went
from
window
to
window
watching
the
clouds
rain
began
to
fall
at
first
it
came
in
a
heavy
downpour
then
slackened
somewhat
the
wind
no
longer
tore
at
the
doors
you
be
able
to
go
any
time
now
said
fenestra
i
can
let
you
have
an
umbrella
it
still
rather
bad
answered
penny
if
you
do
mind
i
believe
we
wait
a
few
minutes
longer
the
decision
displeased
the
man
frowning
he
turned
to
gaze
at
the
girls
somewhat
critically
who
sent
you
here
he
demanded
why
did
you
come
his
manner
was
so
suspicious
that
penny
sensed
it
was
no
time
to
reveal
the
real
purpose
of
the
visit
instead
she
said
my
father
has
a
cottage
along
the
river
we
were
returning
from
there
when
the
storm
broke
her
explanation
seemed
to
satisfy
the
man
he
shrugged
and
fell
to
pacing
the
floor
restlessly
the
rain
presently
ceased
penny
and
louise
felt
that
they
no
longer
could
delay
their
departure
saying
to
fenestra
they
left
the
house
rounding
a
corner
of
the
building
they
were
startled
to
hear
a
light
tap
on
the
window
glancing
up
they
saw
tillie
fellow
face
pressed
against
the
pane
she
signaling
for
us
to
wait
observed
penny
i
guess
she
wants
to
talk
with
us
the
girls
stepped
into
the
doorway
of
a
woodshed
in
a
moment
tillie
slipped
from
the
house
a
coat
thrown
over
her
head
i
hope
old
fenestra
does
see
me
she
greeted
the
girls
nervously
let
get
out
of
sight
penny
and
louise
followed
her
into
the
woodshed
closing
the
door
how
long
have
you
worked
here
the
latter
inquired
curiously
ever
since
i
met
you
girls
on
the
boat
i
answered
an
advertisement
the
next
morning
and
got
this
job
do
you
like
it
asked
penny
i
imagine
farm
work
is
hard
the
work
is
easy
enough
but
i
hate
the
place
that
why
i
wanted
to
talk
with
you
do
you
know
of
anyone
who
needs
a
girl
i
work
for
very
small
wages
i
do
know
of
anyone
at
the
moment
responded
penny
i
ca
stay
here
much
longer
tillie
said
a
note
of
desperation
in
her
voice
fenestra
is
so
overbearing
and
mean
he
ca
bear
noise
either
if
i
as
much
as
rattle
a
dish
he
berates
me
does
he
pay
you
a
decent
wage
inquired
louise
ten
dollars
a
week
i
ca
complain
on
that
score
but
something
about
him
i
ca
explain
it
gives
me
the
creeps
fenestra
is
a
peculiar
type
admitted
penny
he
did
act
very
friendly
toward
louise
and
me
by
the
way
why
does
he
keep
the
storm
cellar
padlocked
that
something
i
wish
you
would
tell
he
would
allow
us
to
enter
it
even
when
the
storm
was
coming
fenestra
always
keeps
the
cave
padlocked
revealed
tillie
he
goes
there
every
day
too
sometimes
he
spends
hours
beneath
ground
it
rather
frightens
me
what
do
you
think
he
does
there
i
do
know
once
i
asked
him
about
the
cave
and
he
flew
into
a
violent
rage
he
said
if
he
ever
caught
me
near
it
he
would
discharge
me
he
told
us
that
the
cave
was
half
filled
with
water
i
do
believe
that
said
tillie
he
has
something
hidden
down
there
have
you
any
idea
what
it
is
no
and
i
do
care
very
much
returned
tillie
all
i
want
to
do
is
get
away
from
this
place
if
you
hear
of
a
job
anywhere
will
you
let
me
know
of
course
promised
penny
weems
our
housekeeper
may
know
of
a
vacancy
if
she
does
i
telephone
we
have
a
telephone
fenestra
had
it
taken
out
because
the
ringing
of
the
bell
made
him
jumpy
he
said
the
neighbors
always
listened
to
his
conversations
too
he
very
suspicious
of
everyone
then
i
can
run
out
in
the
car
said
penny
i
do
blame
you
for
not
liking
this
place
i
should
either
thanks
for
everything
replied
tillie
gratefully
you
been
awfully
good
to
me
i
must
run
back
now
or
old
fenestra
will
ask
me
a
million
questions
hastily
saying
she
darted
away
walking
slowly
toward
the
road
penny
and
louise
discussed
peter
fenestra
strange
actions
they
were
inclined
to
agree
with
tillie
that
he
had
hidden
something
of
value
beneath
ground
across
the
road
from
the
farmhouse
a
giant
elm
tree
had
been
uprooted
they
saw
overturned
chicken
houses
fences
laid
flat
tangles
of
telephone
and
electric
wires
even
more
damage
must
have
been
done
farther
down
the
river
remarked
penny
anxiously
i
hope
our
new
cottage
has
blown
away
shall
we
go
there
and
see
i
wish
we
could
for
several
hundred
yards
the
girls
followed
the
road
then
once
more
they
cut
across
the
fields
toward
the
winding
river
as
they
approached
the
parker
property
their
misgivings
increased
all
along
the
water
front
trees
had
been
toppled
and
split
in
sections
there
were
wide
paths
cut
as
if
by
a
scythe
the
cottage
is
still
there
penny
cried
as
they
presently
ascended
to
higher
ground
i
can
see
it
several
trees
are
down
observed
louise
one
has
fallen
across
the
porch
a
beautiful
birch
too
murmured
penny
anchor
joe
will
have
a
job
clearing
it
away
approaching
the
cottage
the
girls
saw
no
glimpse
of
the
workman
penny
called
his
name
several
times
i
wonder
where
he
went
she
murmured
the
girls
rounded
the
corner
of
the
cottage
as
their
eyes
fell
upon
the
giant
birch
which
had
demolished
the
porch
railing
they
were
startled
to
see
a
slight
movement
among
the
leaves
a
hand
lay
limp
against
the
trunk
anchor
joe
gasped
penny
in
horror
he
pinned
beneath
the
tree
chapter
word
to
the
penny
and
louise
stooped
beside
the
groaning
man
who
lay
pinned
on
his
side
beneath
the
tree
as
they
attempted
to
move
him
he
writhed
in
pain
and
pleaded
with
them
not
to
touch
him
the
tree
will
have
to
be
lifted
declared
penny
i
go
for
help
leaving
louise
to
encourage
anchor
joe
she
ran
the
entire
distance
to
the
main
road
the
nearest
house
was
the
one
owned
by
peter
fenestra
however
as
she
hastened
in
that
direction
she
observed
a
truck
filled
with
telephone
linemen
coming
toward
her
hailing
the
men
she
told
them
what
had
occurred
i
am
afraid
anchor
joe
is
badly
hurt
she
added
i
telephone
for
a
doctor
while
you
go
on
to
the
cottage
one
of
the
linemen
offered
to
make
the
call
leaving
her
free
to
guide
the
other
four
men
to
the
parker
camp
reaching
the
spot
the
men
raised
the
fallen
tree
carefully
they
lifted
anchor
joe
who
had
lapsed
into
unconsciousness
bring
him
into
the
cottage
penny
directed
going
ahead
to
open
doors
one
of
the
rooms
had
been
furnished
as
a
bedroom
with
an
old
cot
a
chest
of
drawers
and
odd
pieces
brought
from
the
parker
home
penny
spread
a
blanket
over
the
mattress
and
the
injured
man
was
stretched
upon
it
he
seriously
hurt
is
he
she
asked
anxiously
afraid
he
is
admitted
one
of
the
linemen
heat
up
some
water
and
do
what
i
can
until
the
doctor
gets
here
penny
and
louise
hastened
to
the
kitchen
to
struggle
with
the
range
by
the
time
they
had
the
fire
going
well
they
heard
voices
in
the
yard
glancing
out
the
window
they
saw
a
lineman
coming
toward
the
cottage
and
walking
beside
a
doctor
who
carried
a
light
black
bag
it
doctor
griswold
observed
louise
he
made
a
quick
trip
from
town
penny
ran
to
open
the
door
for
the
two
men
then
at
the
bidding
she
went
to
the
kitchen
again
for
the
boiling
water
you
carry
it
in
urged
louise
i
ca
bear
to
see
poor
anchor
joe
the
linemen
had
left
by
the
time
penny
reentered
the
bedroom
the
doctor
was
working
over
anchor
joe
and
she
observed
in
relief
that
he
had
recovered
consciousness
where
do
you
feel
pain
the
doctor
inquired
as
he
unfastened
the
shirt
my
back
and
chest
doc
the
sailor
mumbled
feels
like
all
my
insides
is
crushed
hardly
that
said
the
doctor
cheerfully
or
you
would
be
telling
me
about
it
now
let
see
he
took
anchor
joe
pulse
then
gently
probed
his
chest
and
sponged
a
break
in
the
skin
carefully
he
turned
the
man
upon
his
back
penny
drew
in
her
breath
nearly
dropping
the
pan
of
water
across
anchor
joe
back
was
tattooed
the
sprawling
figure
of
an
octopus
she
bent
closer
beneath
the
front
arms
of
the
repulsive
sea
creature
appeared
a
single
word
john
munn
tattoo
was
exactly
the
same
save
for
the
word
thought
penny
it
was
while
this
is
what
can
be
the
significance
even
the
doctor
was
startled
by
the
strange
tattoo
for
he
glanced
at
it
curiously
as
he
probed
you
are
a
sailor
he
inquired
that
right
muttered
anchor
joe
ouch
doc
take
it
easy
will
you
penny
could
not
remain
silent
joe
do
you
know
a
man
named
john
munn
she
asked
sure
i
know
him
the
sailor
mumbled
we
shipped
together
on
the
your
tattoo
is
very
similar
to
his
anchor
joe
eyes
turned
upon
penny
as
if
he
were
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
he
made
an
effort
to
pull
the
blanket
over
his
back
we
had
put
on
together
he
muttered
jack
an
john
and
that
rat
otto
please
do
talk
to
the
patient
said
the
doctor
significantly
he
should
be
kept
quiet
i
sorry
apologized
penny
she
did
not
speak
again
until
the
doctor
had
completed
his
examination
and
had
bandaged
anchor
joe
cuts
and
bruises
what
do
you
advise
doctor
she
asked
will
it
be
necessary
to
remove
joe
to
a
hospital
neither
advisable
nor
desirable
for
at
least
hours
he
replied
i
find
no
indication
of
internal
injury
but
it
is
best
to
be
safe
the
patient
should
be
kept
quiet
in
bed
for
at
least
a
day
or
two
it
something
of
a
problem
to
care
for
him
here
said
penny
frowning
do
you
suggest
a
nurse
any
woman
who
has
had
practical
experience
in
caring
for
the
sick
would
do
weems
may
be
willing
to
come
said
penny
i
telephone
home
at
once
and
learn
what
arrangements
can
be
made
when
the
doctor
left
penny
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
first
house
from
there
she
telephoned
her
father
who
promised
to
get
weems
and
come
at
once
to
the
cottage
louise
was
uneasily
waiting
by
the
time
penny
returned
outside
the
bedroom
they
held
whispered
consultation
has
anchor
joe
talked
penny
questioned
you
know
what
i
mean
has
he
said
anything
about
john
munn
or
the
tattoo
not
a
word
but
every
so
often
he
mutters
that
he
get
even
with
someone
by
the
name
of
otto
a
fellow
sailor
who
he
mentioned
otto
when
i
was
in
the
room
nodded
penny
i
wish
we
dared
question
joe
but
the
doctor
advised
against
it
i
do
think
we
should
annoy
him
now
perhaps
later
on
he
tell
us
about
the
tattoo
and
its
meaning
perhaps
echoed
penny
however
if
i
am
any
judge
of
character
anchor
joe
is
the
talkative
type
as
soon
as
he
gets
over
the
shock
of
this
accident
he
lock
those
lips
of
his
we
learn
nothing
why
are
you
so
convinced
there
a
deep
mystery
connected
with
the
tattoo
i
ca
explain
it
lou
i
just
there
is
i
never
rest
until
i
learn
the
significance
of
those
words
and
within
a
half
hour
weems
and
parker
arrived
at
the
cottage
bringing
a
supply
of
linen
food
and
comforts
for
the
injured
man
the
housekeeper
agreed
to
assume
charge
until
anchor
joe
could
be
safely
removed
to
a
hospital
when
parker
drove
to
riverview
the
girls
accompanied
him
during
the
ride
penny
questioned
her
father
regarding
anchor
joe
i
know
almost
nothing
about
him
he
replied
he
was
sent
to
me
by
the
acme
employment
agency
and
i
did
bother
to
ask
for
a
recommendation
i
learned
that
he
a
friend
of
john
munn
revealed
penny
as
soon
as
he
able
to
get
about
again
i
mean
to
ask
him
a
number
of
things
parker
drove
louise
to
her
home
and
at
penny
request
dropped
her
off
at
the
office
by
the
way
what
about
dinner
tonight
he
inquired
shall
we
dine
at
the
commodore
hotel
oh
dad
i
wish
i
could
penny
sighed
wistfully
work
is
stacked
a
mile
high
on
my
desk
i
just
grab
a
sandwich
somewhere
and
work
late
i
am
afraid
you
are
taking
the
newspaper
business
too
seriously
replied
her
father
shall
i
leave
the
car
for
you
it
would
be
a
help
all
right
penny
parker
gave
her
the
car
keys
and
walked
on
to
his
own
newspaper
entering
the
building
penny
spoke
to
several
high
school
boys
who
were
working
in
the
advertising
office
and
climbed
the
stairs
to
her
own
office
for
the
next
half
hour
she
checked
over
galley
proofs
marking
corrections
on
the
margins
i
never
imagined
there
could
be
so
many
things
to
do
on
a
weekly
she
sighed
one
never
gets
through
a
board
creaked
in
the
newsroom
penny
heard
it
and
glanced
up
a
shadow
passed
slowly
across
the
frosted
glass
of
the
office
door
come
in
she
called
no
one
answered
and
the
shadow
disappeared
penny
waited
a
moment
then
impatiently
arose
and
went
to
the
door
the
newsroom
was
deserted
queer
she
thought
someone
walked
past
my
office
door
thinking
that
it
might
have
been
one
of
the
high
school
boys
penny
went
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
called
did
anyone
come
up
here
a
moment
ago
not
unless
it
was
by
way
of
the
back
entrance
was
the
reply
decidedly
puzzled
penny
returned
to
her
desk
as
she
sat
down
a
sheet
of
paper
lying
on
the
blotter
pad
drew
her
attention
she
was
certain
it
had
not
been
there
a
few
minutes
earlier
reaching
for
it
she
gasped
in
astonishment
the
paper
bore
a
message
scrawled
in
black
ink
and
read
to
the
editor
of
the
you
are
hereby
warned
to
give
up
your
newspaper
which
offends
public
taste
we
give
you
three
days
to
wind
up
your
business
and
close
doors
a
word
to
the
wise
is
sufficient
chapter
judson
penny
read
the
message
three
times
obviously
it
had
been
placed
on
her
desk
during
the
few
minutes
she
had
been
absent
yet
she
reasoned
that
it
would
be
useless
to
search
for
the
cowardly
person
who
undoubtedly
had
slipped
from
the
building
so
i
am
warned
to
close
shop
she
muttered
angrily
and
the
offends
public
taste
penny
crumpled
the
paper
into
a
ball
hurling
it
toward
the
wire
basket
reconsidering
her
action
she
recovered
the
note
and
carefully
smoothing
the
wrinkles
placed
it
in
her
purse
i
show
this
to
dad
she
told
herself
but
no
one
else
when
penny
anger
had
cooled
she
was
left
with
a
vague
sensation
of
misgiving
resolutely
she
reflected
that
it
was
not
unusual
for
editors
to
receive
threatening
notes
often
her
father
had
shown
her
such
communications
sent
to
the
by
cranks
it
does
mean
a
thing
she
assured
herself
not
a
thing
i
keep
on
publishing
the
as
long
as
i
please
one
fact
contributed
to
penny
uneasiness
often
she
worked
late
in
the
building
and
a
single
light
burning
from
an
upper
story
window
proclaimed
to
any
street
watcher
that
she
was
alone
in
the
future
she
must
use
far
more
caution
try
as
she
would
penny
could
not
forget
the
warning
after
the
boys
who
comprised
the
advertising
staff
had
gone
home
for
dinner
she
caught
herself
listening
tensely
to
every
unusual
sound
at
length
she
shut
the
desk
and
arose
i
doing
no
good
here
she
thought
in
disgust
i
may
as
well
go
home
taking
particular
care
to
lock
all
doors
and
windows
penny
left
the
building
street
lights
were
blinking
on
as
she
climbed
into
the
parked
automobile
driving
mechanically
she
weaved
through
downtown
traffic
now
and
then
halting
for
a
red
light
as
she
was
starting
ahead
from
an
intersection
an
elderly
man
suddenly
stepped
from
the
curb
his
gaze
was
upon
the
pavement
and
he
did
not
see
the
car
penny
swerved
the
wheel
and
slammed
on
the
foot
brake
the
edge
of
the
fender
brushed
the
man
overcoat
he
gasped
in
astonishment
and
staggered
backwards
penny
brought
the
car
to
a
standstill
at
the
curb
you
not
hurt
she
called
anxiously
no
no
the
man
murmured
in
a
bewildered
way
as
he
turned
his
face
toward
her
penny
recognized
matthew
judson
the
former
publisher
of
the
calling
him
by
name
she
invited
him
into
the
car
let
me
take
you
home
or
wherever
you
are
going
she
urged
you
look
well
judson
i
am
afraid
i
frightened
you
it
was
my
fault
admitted
the
old
gentleman
staring
at
penny
i
i
was
thinking
about
something
when
i
stepped
from
the
curb
this
is
a
dangerous
intersection
please
judson
ca
i
take
you
home
if
you
insist
he
murmured
entering
the
car
you
seem
to
know
my
name
but
i
have
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
i
penny
parker
my
father
publishes
the
oh
yes
judson
voice
became
spiritless
your
home
is
on
drexel
boulevard
i
believe
penny
inquired
matthew
judson
nodded
and
in
the
same
dull
lifeless
voice
supplied
the
address
he
made
no
attempt
at
conversation
as
she
stole
occasional
glimpses
at
the
man
penny
thought
that
his
face
bore
lines
of
mental
fatigue
and
discouragement
he
stared
straight
ahead
with
glazed
unseeing
eyes
hoping
to
start
a
conversation
she
presently
remarked
that
she
was
the
managing
editor
of
the
for
the
first
time
matthew
judson
displayed
interest
oh
are
you
the
girl
who
has
taken
over
my
building
he
asked
yes
veeley
allows
me
the
use
of
it
rent
free
i
hope
you
mind
mind
repeated
judson
laughing
mirthlessly
why
should
i
well
i
thought
that
is
penny
began
to
stammer
you
thought
that
because
i
gave
up
my
own
paper
i
might
not
wish
to
see
the
building
used
by
another
something
like
that
admitted
penny
i
try
not
to
think
about
the
past
said
judson
quietly
long
ago
i
made
my
decision
and
now
must
abide
by
it
i
realize
that
i
never
can
publish
the
again
i
broken
beaten
the
old
man
spoke
with
such
bitterness
that
penny
glanced
quickly
at
him
there
was
an
expression
in
his
dark
eyes
which
startled
her
surely
one
ca
be
defeated
as
long
as
he
willing
to
fight
she
ventured
why
if
you
chose
to
make
a
i
certain
you
would
succeed
judson
shook
his
head
impatiently
you
do
understand
i
am
through
finished
all
i
can
hope
to
do
is
to
hold
fast
to
what
little
i
have
and
try
to
protect
pauletta
pauletta
is
your
wife
penny
inquired
kindly
my
daughter
if
it
were
for
her
judson
hesitated
then
finished
in
a
voice
quite
casual
if
it
were
for
her
i
probably
would
end
it
all
penny
was
shocked
why
mr
judson
she
protested
you
ca
mean
that
do
be
alarmed
he
said
smiling
faintly
i
have
no
intention
of
taking
the
easy
way
out
a
dozen
questions
flashed
through
penny
mind
but
she
was
afraid
to
ask
any
of
them
from
judson
remarks
it
was
fairly
evident
that
he
never
had
relinquished
the
voluntarily
could
financial
difficulties
alone
account
for
his
state
of
mental
depression
in
the
darkening
twilight
the
car
approached
a
brick
house
set
back
some
distance
from
the
boulevard
once
an
elegant
dwelling
peeling
paint
had
made
it
an
unsightly
residence
roof
shingles
were
curling
the
front
porch
sagged
while
an
iron
fence
only
partially
hid
a
wide
expanse
of
untended
lawn
this
is
my
home
said
judson
turn
into
the
driveway
if
you
wish
penny
stopped
the
car
just
inside
the
iron
gate
as
judson
alighted
a
girl
who
appeared
to
be
in
her
early
twenties
arose
from
a
bench
a
white
collie
at
her
side
she
came
toward
the
car
midway
across
the
lawn
she
paused
staring
then
she
half
turned
as
if
to
retreat
pauletta
called
judson
will
you
come
here
please
reluctantly
the
girl
approached
the
car
her
gaze
meeting
penny
almost
defiantly
pauletta
was
a
beautiful
girl
with
auburn
hair
and
eyes
pauletta
this
is
miss
parker
said
her
father
how
do
you
do
responded
the
girl
coldly
the
instant
penny
heard
the
voice
she
knew
where
she
previously
had
seen
judson
daughter
on
the
steamer
pauletta
was
the
girl
who
had
tossed
a
wig
and
clothing
into
the
river
how
do
you
do
miss
judson
she
responded
have
we
met
before
pauletta
kept
her
face
averted
from
her
father
she
met
penny
gaze
with
a
bold
stare
i
think
not
she
said
evenly
no
miss
parker
you
are
mistaken
chapter
penny
made
no
reply
to
pauletta
and
the
silence
became
unbearable
wo
you
stay
for
a
few
minutes
judson
invited
pauletta
why
not
show
miss
parker
our
rose
garden
it
rather
dark
his
daughter
replied
anyway
she
would
care
to
see
it
indeed
i
should
contradicted
penny
deliberately
she
switched
off
the
car
ignition
pauletta
glared
at
her
but
dared
make
no
protest
in
her
presence
with
a
shrug
she
led
penny
along
a
gravel
path
to
the
rear
of
the
house
judson
remained
behind
as
soon
as
they
were
beyond
hearing
penny
said
quietly
need
we
pretend
i
am
sure
you
recall
that
we
met
aboard
the
yes
i
remember
now
admitted
pauletta
coldly
you
were
with
another
girl
and
you
were
accompanied
by
a
young
man
a
friend
of
mine
this
may
be
something
of
a
shock
said
penny
but
my
chum
and
i
saw
you
drop
a
bundle
containing
a
wig
into
the
river
oh
the
bundle
caught
fast
and
i
fished
it
out
you
have
no
proof
it
was
mine
you
you
wo
tell
father
not
if
you
can
offer
a
good
reason
why
i
should
there
are
any
number
of
them
you
must
tell
my
father
that
why
i
pretended
not
to
know
you
i
certainly
wish
you
would
explain
tillie
fellows
was
robbed
that
night
who
is
tillie
fellows
one
of
the
excursionists
her
pocketbook
was
taken
shortly
before
the
boat
docked
you
ca
believe
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
do
wish
to
think
so
but
your
actions
were
very
strange
i
can
explain
everything
pauletta
said
hurriedly
my
reason
for
wearing
a
disguise
was
a
simple
one
i
did
care
to
have
anyone
on
the
boat
recognize
me
why
may
i
ask
before
pauletta
could
answer
judson
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
please
say
nothing
about
it
to
father
the
young
woman
pleaded
in
a
whisper
i
explain
everything
later
penny
nodded
and
for
judson
benefit
offered
a
few
remarks
about
the
roses
we
once
had
a
beautiful
garden
commented
pauletta
now
it
in
ruin
the
same
as
the
yard
father
does
look
after
the
place
as
he
should
the
grounds
are
large
replied
judson
mildly
you
should
try
to
do
the
work
yourself
pauletta
protested
it
was
foolish
of
you
to
let
the
gardener
go
penny
felt
increasingly
ill
at
ease
as
they
wandered
about
the
grounds
pauletta
kept
making
disparaging
remarks
thoughtless
comments
which
wounded
her
father
however
he
offered
no
rebuttal
nor
did
he
reprove
his
daughter
i
really
must
be
going
said
penny
at
last
it
getting
very
dark
judson
walked
with
her
to
the
car
closing
the
gate
after
she
had
driven
from
the
grounds
he
stood
there
a
moment
the
wind
rumpling
his
gray
hair
then
he
raised
his
hand
in
friendly
salute
and
turned
toward
the
house
poor
judson
she
thought
so
discouraged
and
yet
so
gallant
how
can
pauletta
be
completely
blind
to
his
suffering
does
she
realize
penny
did
not
regret
having
kept
the
young
woman
secret
for
she
felt
that
the
revelation
of
their
meeting
would
only
add
to
troubles
pauletta
represented
his
entire
life
and
if
it
developed
that
she
had
acted
unbecomingly
the
shock
might
be
a
severe
one
i
ca
believe
that
pauletta
would
steal
she
told
herself
she
must
have
had
another
reason
for
wearing
the
disguise
penny
was
satisfied
that
if
judson
had
not
interrupted
the
young
woman
would
have
explained
her
puzzling
actions
therefore
she
was
willing
to
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
return
as
soon
as
she
could
to
talk
privately
with
pauletta
the
parker
house
was
dark
and
deserted
when
penny
let
herself
in
with
a
key
her
father
had
not
expected
her
home
so
early
and
disliking
an
empty
house
had
remained
away
there
was
no
telling
where
he
had
gone
after
preparing
a
belated
dinner
for
herself
penny
spent
an
hour
with
her
studies
however
her
mind
kept
reverting
to
the
events
of
the
day
a
great
deal
had
happened
her
meeting
with
peter
fenestra
had
been
interesting
anchor
joe
mishap
worried
her
and
she
remained
disturbed
by
the
threatening
message
left
on
her
desk
could
it
have
been
written
by
a
prowler
in
the
building
she
mused
ever
since
we
started
the
paper
i
felt
that
someone
was
hiding
there
it
may
be
a
scheme
to
get
me
away
before
dropping
off
to
sleep
penny
made
up
her
mind
that
the
following
night
she
would
set
a
trap
for
the
intruder
taking
louise
into
her
confidence
she
made
careful
plans
preparing
a
tasty
lunch
the
girls
wrapped
and
laid
it
conspicuously
on
the
counter
of
the
downstairs
advertising
room
now
the
stage
is
set
declared
penny
louise
you
go
upstairs
to
my
office
and
tap
on
the
typewriter
i
hide
here
and
see
what
happens
after
louise
had
gone
penny
secreted
herself
in
a
storage
closet
not
far
from
the
counter
by
leaving
the
door
open
she
could
see
fairly
well
in
the
dark
room
for
street
lights
cast
a
reflection
through
the
plate
glass
windows
the
minutes
stretched
into
a
half
hour
louise
typewriting
at
first
very
energetic
began
to
slacken
in
speed
penny
moved
restlessly
in
the
cramped
quarters
she
had
not
imagined
that
waiting
could
be
so
tedious
an
hour
elapsed
far
down
the
street
a
clock
struck
ten
times
with
a
weary
sigh
penny
arose
from
the
floor
inactivity
bored
her
and
she
no
longer
could
sit
quietly
and
wait
as
she
started
from
her
hiding
place
intending
to
call
louise
a
door
opened
at
the
west
end
of
the
room
instantly
penny
froze
against
the
wall
waiting
a
flashlight
beam
played
across
the
floor
missing
her
by
a
scant
two
feet
penny
her
heart
beating
at
a
furious
rate
remained
motionless
she
could
see
the
squat
shadowy
figure
of
a
man
moving
toward
her
boards
squeaked
beneath
his
weight
midway
across
the
room
the
man
paused
evidently
listening
to
the
steady
clatter
of
louise
typewriter
satisfied
he
went
to
the
window
where
he
stood
for
several
minutes
watching
street
traffic
as
he
turned
again
the
beam
of
his
flashlight
swept
across
the
front
counter
focusing
upon
the
package
of
food
the
man
gave
a
low
exclamation
of
pleasure
with
the
swiftness
of
a
cat
he
darted
to
it
and
tore
off
the
paper
wrapping
penny
waited
until
he
was
eating
greedily
then
stealing
along
the
wall
she
groped
for
the
electric
light
switch
as
she
pressed
it
the
room
was
brilliantly
illuminated
at
the
same
instant
the
girl
gave
a
shrill
whistle
a
signal
to
louise
that
the
culprit
had
been
trapped
the
man
at
the
counter
whirled
around
facing
penny
with
startled
dismay
he
was
a
gaunt
unshaven
fellow
in
his
late
fifties
with
shaggy
hair
and
soiled
unpressed
clothing
before
he
could
retreat
louise
came
down
the
stairway
blocking
the
exit
what
are
you
doing
here
penny
questioned
him
why
did
you
steal
my
lunch
the
man
lips
moved
nervously
but
no
sound
issued
from
them
shall
i
call
the
police
prodded
penny
she
gave
him
a
severe
glance
no
do
do
that
the
man
pleaded
finding
his
voice
do
call
the
police
i
go
i
wo
bother
you
any
more
why
have
you
been
hiding
in
the
building
because
i
have
no
other
place
to
sleep
miss
the
cops
chase
you
off
the
park
benches
penny
was
surprised
by
the
man
speech
which
belied
his
disreputable
garments
his
tone
was
well
modulated
his
manner
respectful
you
been
living
in
this
building
a
long
while
she
asked
curiously
maybe
six
months
i
sleep
down
in
the
furnace
room
i
did
do
any
harm
you
hungry
are
you
penny
inquired
less
severely
yes
i
am
miss
lately
i
have
been
eating
any
too
often
you
may
finish
the
lunch
said
penny
and
there
a
thermos
bottle
of
coffee
under
the
counter
thank
you
miss
thank
you
i
surely
am
obliged
with
a
hand
which
trembled
the
man
poured
himself
a
cup
of
the
steaming
beverage
you
have
told
me
your
name
said
penny
after
a
moment
folks
just
call
me
horney
old
horney
what
is
your
real
name
mark
horning
the
man
answered
reluctantly
i
curious
to
learn
how
you
been
getting
in
and
out
of
the
building
with
a
key
old
horney
devoured
the
last
bite
of
sandwich
and
poured
himself
a
second
cup
of
coffee
a
skeleton
key
you
mean
penny
asked
in
surprise
no
miss
i
have
my
own
key
in
the
old
days
i
used
to
work
here
you
a
former
employee
sure
i
know
it
hard
to
believe
old
horney
replied
but
when
a
fellow
out
of
a
job
and
money
it
does
take
long
to
go
to
seed
i
lost
my
place
when
judson
closed
down
and
you
been
unable
to
find
other
work
in
the
past
nine
months
i
worked
exactly
six
days
no
one
hires
an
old
fellow
any
more
if
i
could
have
kept
on
with
judson
three
more
years
i
have
been
due
for
my
pension
what
work
did
you
do
on
the
paper
asked
penny
with
growing
interest
i
was
a
pressman
penny
shot
louise
a
glance
which
was
almost
triumphant
her
voice
when
she
spoke
held
an
undertone
of
excitement
horney
she
said
it
barely
possible
i
may
be
able
to
find
some
sort
of
work
for
you
later
on
do
you
mind
writing
your
name
on
this
paper
the
old
man
took
the
sheet
she
handed
him
without
hesitation
scrawling
his
name
penny
studied
the
writing
a
moment
to
her
relief
it
bore
not
the
slightest
resemblance
to
the
warning
message
left
on
her
desk
the
previous
night
horney
she
questioned
did
you
ever
try
to
frighten
me
away
from
this
building
oh
no
miss
he
replied
once
i
tiptoed
up
to
your
office
when
i
saw
you
were
working
there
i
slipped
down
to
the
basement
again
did
you
ever
place
a
note
on
my
desk
i
never
did
penny
was
satisfied
that
horney
had
told
the
truth
yet
if
he
were
not
the
culprit
she
was
unable
to
guess
who
had
warned
her
to
abandon
the
plant
horney
i
decided
that
we
need
a
watchman
around
this
place
she
said
abruptly
if
you
want
the
job
it
yours
you
not
turning
me
out
no
you
may
stay
i
ca
promise
much
of
a
salary
but
at
least
have
a
place
to
sleep
and
enough
food
you
mighty
kind
horney
mumbled
gratefully
mighty
kind
he
hesitated
and
then
added
i
promise
you
wo
be
sorry
you
did
it
miss
maybe
you
find
i
can
be
of
some
real
use
around
this
plant
i
at
your
service
and
what
more
i
for
you
one
hundred
per
cent
chapter
the
next
afternoon
penny
and
louise
arrived
at
the
to
find
that
the
entire
lower
floor
had
been
cleaned
and
swept
old
horney
was
discovered
in
the
composing
room
stirring
up
a
great
cloud
of
dust
with
a
stub
of
a
broom
i
was
just
cleaning
the
place
up
a
bit
he
said
apologetically
hope
you
do
mind
mind
laughed
penny
i
delighted
our
staff
of
janitors
has
lost
interest
here
of
late
i
set
a
little
type
for
you
last
night
too
why
horney
i
did
know
you
were
a
linotype
operator
i
not
answered
the
old
man
but
i
can
learn
most
anything
if
i
set
my
mind
to
it
if
you
have
any
jobs
you
want
done
just
turn
them
over
to
me
horney
said
penny
soberly
more
than
anything
else
i
would
like
to
publish
the
in
my
own
plant
the
obstacles
seem
almost
too
great
to
overcome
do
you
think
it
could
be
accomplished
why
sure
said
horney
if
i
had
some
tools
and
a
little
to
do
with
i
could
get
the
presses
ready
in
a
day
what
about
the
stereotyping
work
i
could
master
the
trick
of
it
declared
horney
confidently
horney
you
a
jewel
laughed
penny
i
place
you
in
charge
of
my
production
department
but
i
fear
i
ca
give
you
a
salary
in
proportion
to
your
duties
do
worry
about
that
miss
i
would
rather
be
working
than
sitting
around
with
nothing
to
do
then
look
over
the
plant
and
make
up
a
list
of
the
things
you
must
have
suggested
penny
i
go
over
to
the
this
minute
and
arrange
for
printing
paper
leaving
louise
in
charge
of
the
office
she
jubilantly
set
forth
for
her
father
plant
now
that
old
horney
had
been
added
to
the
staff
of
the
problems
which
previously
had
seemed
unsurmountable
suddenly
had
become
easily
solved
entering
the
building
penny
went
directly
to
the
stockroom
wandering
about
until
she
found
curry
the
foreman
here
something
for
you
she
grinned
offering
a
slip
of
paper
what
this
curry
asked
with
a
puzzled
frown
an
order
for
a
roll
of
paper
yes
curry
explained
penny
at
last
i
am
going
to
publish
my
own
sheet
over
in
the
old
building
dad
is
staking
me
to
a
little
paper
a
little
why
one
of
these
big
rolls
would
print
more
copies
of
your
paper
than
you
could
sell
in
six
months
and
paper
is
expensive
how
about
a
or
even
a
quarter
it
would
be
a
lot
easier
to
handle
oh
all
right
agreed
penny
just
so
i
get
enough
to
print
my
first
issue
curry
led
the
way
to
one
of
the
presses
pointing
to
a
roll
of
paper
mounted
on
a
feeding
rack
that
one
is
about
half
used
up
he
said
will
it
do
yes
i
guess
so
agreed
penny
may
i
have
it
right
away
curry
replied
by
pushing
a
tram
along
a
miniature
railway
which
ran
under
the
press
with
surprising
skill
he
maneuvered
the
roll
into
position
on
the
carrier
then
he
pushed
the
tram
to
the
elevator
moved
the
portable
paper
lift
over
the
roll
and
up
it
went
to
the
platform
the
elevator
grounded
at
the
first
floor
where
the
paper
was
rolled
to
the
loading
dock
with
pry
bars
there
you
are
said
the
foreman
all
i
need
now
is
a
truck
penny
cried
exultantly
thanks
mr
curry
standing
guard
beside
her
paper
she
waited
until
one
of
the
drivers
had
finished
unloading
his
cargo
and
was
ready
to
pull
from
the
dock
how
chances
fer
a
ride
buddy
asked
penny
jerking
her
thumb
in
the
manner
of
a
me
and
my
paper
to
the
okay
laughed
the
trucker
he
rolled
the
paper
onto
the
truck
and
penny
climbed
into
the
cab
beside
him
at
the
building
she
had
the
roll
set
off
at
the
rear
entrance
where
old
horney
easily
could
get
it
to
the
press
room
highly
elated
penny
mounted
the
steps
two
at
a
time
bursting
in
upon
louise
who
was
busy
writing
headlines
got
it
she
announced
about
six
hundred
pounds
of
paper
that
should
keep
the
going
for
awhile
here
something
to
dampen
your
enthusiasm
louise
thrust
a
letter
toward
her
another
kick
on
that
octopus
tattoo
story
you
wrote
a
brown
says
she
heartily
disapproves
of
such
outlandish
tales
and
that
she
never
buy
another
copy
of
the
at
least
it
proves
my
story
attracted
attention
chuckled
penny
anything
else
while
i
was
gone
yes
weems
telephoned
to
ask
that
you
come
to
the
cottage
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
reminds
me
the
telephone
bill
the
company
requires
a
month
advance
never
mind
the
bills
interrupted
penny
did
weems
say
anything
about
anchor
joe
he
appears
to
be
much
better
i
glad
of
that
i
suppose
i
should
drive
out
to
the
cottage
before
it
gets
dark
run
along
i
look
after
everything
here
penny
swept
her
desk
clear
of
papers
and
locked
the
drawers
if
you
have
any
spare
time
you
might
see
what
you
can
do
with
my
algebra
assignment
she
suggested
i
missed
every
problem
but
one
yesterday
i
have
my
own
lesson
troubles
responded
louise
i
wading
up
to
my
neck
in
latin
and
the
next
monthly
quiz
is
certain
to
drown
me
teachers
have
no
consideration
sighed
penny
none
at
all
gathering
up
her
school
books
she
bade
louise
and
left
the
office
on
the
stairway
she
met
old
horney
i
made
my
list
he
said
offering
it
to
her
i
figure
we
ca
get
out
the
paper
with
less
than
this
penny
glanced
at
the
paper
and
slipped
it
into
her
purse
i
get
the
things
somehow
she
promised
by
the
way
there
a
roll
of
paper
on
the
loading
dock
i
already
hauled
in
replied
old
horney
any
other
jobs
for
me
no
you
seem
to
be
one
jump
ahead
laughed
penny
they
descended
the
stairway
together
the
steps
creaking
beneath
their
weight
there
was
a
different
look
to
old
horney
penny
thought
stealing
a
glance
at
him
his
hair
had
been
cut
and
his
face
was
work
had
given
him
a
new
outlook
a
desire
to
recover
his
self
respect
i
suppose
you
knew
matthew
judson
rather
well
she
remarked
reflectively
oh
sure
what
was
he
like
horney
well
the
old
man
hesitated
at
a
loss
for
words
judson
was
queer
sort
of
cold
and
unfriendly
except
to
those
who
knew
him
best
but
he
was
a
the
employes
liked
him
everyone
did
except
a
few
chronic
horney
was
it
true
that
the
was
making
money
at
the
time
it
closed
that
what
everyone
on
the
paper
thought
it
was
a
shock
to
us
all
when
judson
closed
down
i
never
forget
the
day
he
told
us
he
was
giving
up
the
plant
the
old
man
looked
like
death
had
struck
him
and
he
cried
when
he
said
to
the
boys
i
wonder
why
he
closed
the
plant
some
say
it
was
because
he
had
lost
a
pile
of
money
speculating
on
the
stock
market
but
i
never
believed
that
judson
was
the
gambling
type
why
do
you
think
he
gave
up
the
paper
horney
i
done
a
lot
of
speculating
on
it
the
old
man
admitted
this
is
just
my
own
idea
but
i
figure
judson
may
have
been
blackmailed
blackmailed
by
whom
i
ca
tell
you
it
only
my
guess
you
have
no
evidence
to
support
such
a
theory
horney
nothing
you
could
call
that
but
the
day
before
judson
quit
he
was
in
the
pressroom
he
was
sort
of
thinking
out
loud
i
guess
anyhow
he
said
to
me
the
dirty
blackmailer
could
do
this
to
me
if
it
were
for
my
daughter
if
it
did
mean
smearing
her
name
fight
did
you
ask
him
what
he
meant
i
made
some
reply
and
then
he
closed
up
like
a
clam
i
figure
he
realized
what
he
was
saying
you
have
any
idea
as
to
whom
he
meant
i
could
make
a
guess
no
matter
what
the
reason
it
was
a
pity
the
had
to
close
declared
penny
i
feel
very
sorry
for
mr
judson
bidding
horney
she
hurried
home
for
her
automobile
however
as
she
drove
toward
the
river
cottage
she
kept
thinking
about
what
the
old
pressman
had
told
her
it
barely
possible
his
theory
is
right
she
mused
but
why
should
judson
submit
to
blackmail
even
for
his
daughter
sake
somehow
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
refuse
to
fit
chapter
empty
darkness
was
inking
the
sky
as
penny
drew
up
at
the
end
of
the
road
parking
her
car
between
scraggly
she
walked
swiftly
along
the
river
trail
soon
approaching
within
view
of
the
parker
cottage
the
fallen
tree
had
been
sawed
into
cord
wood
the
yard
cleaned
of
sticks
and
debris
and
only
the
damaged
porch
remained
to
remind
one
of
the
severe
storm
as
penny
opened
the
screen
door
weems
came
from
the
kitchen
joe
is
asleep
she
warned
in
a
whisper
perhaps
we
should
talk
outside
penny
nodded
and
followed
the
housekeeper
to
the
porch
swing
how
is
he
doing
she
inquired
oh
much
better
replied
weems
the
doctor
was
here
an
hour
ago
joe
is
out
of
danger
but
must
remain
in
bed
for
at
least
another
day
i
was
afraid
when
you
telephoned
that
something
had
gone
wrong
here
no
confessed
the
housekeeper
i
was
merely
lonesome
for
news
is
everything
going
well
at
home
oh
yes
we
getting
along
fine
i
hope
you
remembered
to
bring
in
the
milk
and
you
did
neglect
the
dusting
penny
smiled
ruefully
i
might
have
known
you
would
let
everything
go
sighed
weems
no
doubt
it
my
duty
to
remain
here
but
i
feel
i
should
be
at
home
anchor
joe
needs
you
weems
has
he
talked
very
much
not
a
great
deal
he
ate
a
hearty
lunch
and
seems
in
no
pain
did
you
see
his
back
mrs
weems
yes
the
cut
was
an
ugly
one
the
doctor
changed
the
dressing
while
he
was
here
i
mean
the
tattoo
said
penny
impatiently
did
you
notice
it
i
saw
that
he
had
one
if
that
what
you
mean
you
did
question
him
about
it
certainly
not
penny
why
should
i
do
you
read
the
anchor
joe
tattoo
is
a
dead
ringer
for
the
one
john
munn
had
on
his
back
joe
already
admitted
that
he
knows
munn
for
all
we
know
they
may
be
bitter
enemies
perhaps
it
was
anchor
joe
who
pushed
munn
off
the
bridge
penny
your
ideas
grow
wilder
each
day
protested
weems
i
hope
you
do
talk
such
nonsense
to
other
people
all
the
same
anchor
joe
bears
someone
a
grudge
insisted
penny
he
mentioned
a
person
who
had
did
you
learn
a
single
fact
about
him
mrs
weems
his
last
name
is
landa
and
he
came
to
riverview
three
weeks
ago
he
has
no
family
i
think
i
question
him
myself
when
he
awakens
no
i
ca
allow
that
said
weems
sternly
the
doctor
would
never
approve
i
promise
not
to
excite
him
the
answer
is
no
now
i
wish
you
would
help
me
by
bringing
in
the
washing
i
must
start
supper
penny
obediently
took
the
basket
and
unpinned
sheets
and
pillow
cases
from
the
line
she
had
just
finished
when
she
observed
a
tall
young
man
with
military
stride
approaching
through
the
trees
he
tipped
his
hat
politely
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
am
trying
to
find
the
parker
cottage
your
search
is
at
an
end
answered
penny
you
come
to
the
right
place
do
you
have
a
man
working
here
named
joe
landa
why
yes
we
have
where
may
i
find
him
please
joe
is
confined
to
his
bed
explained
penny
unless
it
is
very
important
i
am
afraid
we
ca
allow
you
to
talk
with
him
today
it
is
important
said
the
stranger
i
am
clark
moyer
from
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
penny
eyes
opened
wide
a
she
demanded
i
am
an
investigator
for
the
government
he
replied
smiling
and
you
after
anchor
joe
i
am
here
to
question
him
what
has
he
done
mr
moyer
i
am
not
permitted
to
discuss
a
case
to
which
i
have
been
assigned
he
returned
amused
by
her
display
of
interest
it
quite
possible
that
landa
is
not
the
man
i
seek
how
long
has
he
worked
here
only
a
few
days
he
he
has
killed
anyone
has
he
no
smiled
the
government
man
it
not
that
serious
the
man
i
am
after
is
short
and
wiry
sandy
hair
and
blue
eyes
he
has
a
tattooed
anchor
on
his
right
arm
and
one
on
his
back
penny
asked
eagerly
i
would
know
about
that
does
my
description
fit
the
man
who
has
been
working
here
yes
it
does
almost
exactly
then
i
like
to
talk
with
him
come
into
the
cottage
invited
penny
i
call
mrs
weems
summoned
from
the
kitchen
the
housekeeper
listened
to
request
that
he
be
permitted
to
see
the
injured
man
if
you
are
a
government
investigator
i
suppose
it
will
be
all
right
she
said
reluctantly
but
the
doctor
orders
were
that
he
was
to
be
kept
absolutely
quiet
i
only
ask
a
question
or
two
promised
moyer
is
joe
wanted
on
a
criminal
charge
the
housekeeper
asked
i
was
sent
to
check
up
on
a
man
who
calls
himself
joe
landa
that
all
i
can
tell
you
from
the
kitchen
came
the
unmistakable
odor
of
scorching
potatoes
weems
ran
to
jerk
the
pan
from
the
stove
penny
you
see
if
joe
is
awake
yet
she
called
over
her
shoulder
i
go
with
you
said
moyer
quickly
if
i
have
made
a
mistake
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
disturb
the
man
this
way
directed
penny
she
led
the
government
man
down
the
hall
to
the
rear
bedroom
the
door
was
closed
she
twisted
the
knob
and
pushed
at
first
easily
and
then
with
increasing
force
it
seems
to
be
stuck
she
said
the
recent
rains
must
have
caused
the
wood
to
swell
let
me
try
offered
moyer
he
took
penny
place
and
after
testing
the
door
gave
it
a
hard
upward
push
there
was
a
loud
crash
as
it
suddenly
swung
open
goodness
what
was
that
exclaimed
penny
a
barricade
keep
back
to
penny
astonishment
the
government
man
drew
his
revolver
before
entering
the
room
disregarding
the
order
to
remain
behind
she
followed
him
inside
i
might
have
expected
this
he
muttered
penny
gaze
swept
the
room
a
chair
lay
overturned
on
the
floor
the
bed
still
bearing
the
imprint
of
a
man
body
was
empty
why
where
joe
murmured
penny
his
clothing
is
gone
too
moyer
strode
to
the
open
window
you
think
he
left
that
way
penny
questioned
he
must
have
heard
us
talking
the
government
man
nodded
as
he
stepped
through
the
opening
to
the
ground
he
heard
us
all
right
there
no
question
now
that
he
the
man
i
am
after
and
i
get
him
too
briefly
examining
the
ground
beneath
the
window
moyer
turned
and
walked
swiftly
toward
the
river
chapter
from
penny
lost
no
time
in
telling
weems
that
anchor
joe
had
disappeared
well
of
all
things
exclaimed
the
housekeeper
as
she
saw
the
deserted
bedroom
he
was
here
a
half
hour
ago
i
know
because
i
came
in
while
he
was
sleeping
he
must
have
heard
moyer
inquiring
about
him
declared
penny
obviously
he
ran
away
to
avoid
the
interview
then
that
means
he
guilty
i
afraid
so
weems
what
do
you
suppose
he
did
to
have
a
government
man
after
him
he
may
have
been
a
gangster
anchor
joe
asked
penny
smiling
he
hardly
looked
the
type
in
any
event
we
fortunate
to
be
rid
of
him
i
wish
we
could
have
questioned
him
penny
said
gloomily
now
i
may
never
learn
about
that
octopus
tattoo
you
and
your
tattoo
scoffed
weems
beginning
to
strip
linen
from
the
bed
anchor
joe
certainly
deceived
me
he
seemed
such
a
pleasant
sort
and
i
was
sorry
for
him
i
still
am
said
penny
the
poor
fellow
is
in
no
condition
to
be
wandering
around
i
rather
hope
moyer
overtakes
him
soon
then
at
least
he
get
the
medical
attention
he
requires
while
weems
straightened
the
bedroom
she
wandered
to
the
edge
only
a
few
stars
were
pricking
the
sky
and
it
was
impossible
to
see
very
far
there
was
no
sign
either
of
moyer
or
the
man
he
pursued
penny
returned
to
the
cottage
to
eat
supper
with
weems
now
that
anchor
joe
has
gone
i
may
as
well
go
home
tonight
declared
the
housekeeper
i
ca
leave
though
until
i
cleaned
the
cottage
and
set
it
to
rights
how
much
longer
will
it
take
oh
an
hour
or
two
while
i
am
waiting
i
may
walk
over
to
peter
fenestra
place
penny
remarked
i
should
mind
seeing
tillie
fellows
again
you
be
cautious
in
crossing
the
river
of
course
laughed
penny
i
wo
be
gone
long
she
washed
the
dishes
for
weems
and
then
set
forth
for
the
fenestra
farmhouse
frogs
croaked
as
she
crossed
the
swaying
bridge
and
far
upstream
she
heard
the
faint
chug
of
a
motorboat
otherwise
the
night
was
unusually
still
emerging
from
among
the
trees
penny
saw
a
light
glowing
in
the
distance
knowing
that
it
came
from
the
fenestra
house
she
used
it
as
a
beacon
to
guide
her
passing
the
barn
she
climbed
a
fence
and
entered
the
yard
the
house
was
dark
save
for
a
single
light
burning
in
the
kitchen
she
could
see
tillie
fellows
moving
about
penny
knocked
on
the
side
door
through
the
window
she
observed
tillie
freeze
into
a
tense
attitude
of
fear
to
reassure
the
girl
she
called
her
name
in
a
loud
voice
immediately
tillie
ran
to
open
the
door
oh
it
you
she
exclaimed
in
relief
i
was
frightened
to
penny
surprise
tillie
wore
a
silk
dress
pocketbook
hat
and
gloves
lay
upon
the
kitchen
table
i
am
afraid
i
come
at
an
awkward
time
she
apologized
you
were
going
somewhere
i
leaving
here
tillie
answered
grimly
she
closed
the
door
behind
penny
you
mean
for
good
you
found
another
job
tillie
shook
her
head
i
been
discharged
he
did
give
me
a
advance
wages
either
oh
that
too
bad
said
penny
sympathetically
but
you
find
a
better
place
you
said
you
did
like
it
here
anyway
i
hated
it
peter
fenestra
is
such
a
suspicious
person
why
do
you
think
he
discharged
me
i
ca
guess
but
i
should
like
to
know
he
accused
me
of
prying
how
unjust
well
in
a
way
i
was
trying
to
learn
about
things
i
should
tillie
admitted
honestly
it
was
that
storm
cave
did
you
get
down
into
it
penny
asked
no
but
i
tried
old
peter
was
gone
this
afternoon
and
i
decided
to
find
out
what
he
keeps
hidden
underground
the
padlock
was
locked
usually
it
is
but
today
he
forgot
i
got
the
door
open
just
as
i
started
down
the
steps
he
grabbed
me
by
the
shoulder
i
was
scared
half
to
death
you
mean
fenestra
had
hidden
himself
in
the
cave
penny
questioned
in
astonishment
yes
it
was
a
trick
to
catch
me
prying
he
said
so
himself
penny
he
only
pretended
to
go
away
then
lay
in
wait
did
he
threaten
you
no
he
just
told
me
to
get
out
and
never
come
back
it
would
surprise
me
if
he
leaves
here
himself
soon
why
do
you
say
that
tillie
because
he
afraid
of
his
own
shadow
but
i
do
blame
him
for
being
nervous
this
house
is
being
watched
as
if
fearing
that
unfriendly
eyes
were
upon
her
at
that
very
moment
tillie
went
to
the
window
and
after
peering
into
the
yard
lowered
the
blind
twice
i
seen
men
hiding
in
the
wheat
field
just
back
of
this
place
she
confided
the
first
time
there
was
only
one
but
yesterday
i
saw
three
are
you
sure
they
were
watching
this
house
tillie
oh
yes
they
were
lying
on
the
ground
for
an
hour
they
scarcely
moved
did
you
tell
fenestra
i
was
afraid
to
do
it
but
i
think
he
knew
all
day
he
kept
inside
the
house
and
i
saw
him
at
the
windows
he
was
as
jumpy
as
a
cat
another
thing
i
saw
him
loading
his
revolver
he
must
fear
for
his
life
i
sure
of
it
penny
even
if
he
only
going
to
the
barn
he
carries
the
revolver
with
him
a
clock
on
the
shelf
above
the
stove
struck
eight
times
mercy
exclaimed
tillie
i
must
hurry
or
i
never
get
away
before
old
peter
returns
excuse
me
while
i
run
upstairs
for
my
suitcase
where
is
fenestra
now
penny
inquired
before
the
girl
could
leave
in
riverview
i
suppose
he
went
away
right
after
supper
run
along
and
get
your
suitcase
penny
advised
i
drive
you
into
town
oh
thanks
the
girl
answered
gratefully
it
wo
take
me
long
after
tillie
had
gone
penny
walked
to
the
window
and
rolled
up
the
blind
across
the
yard
she
could
see
the
disfiguring
mound
of
earth
and
cement
what
secret
did
the
storm
cave
guard
why
was
it
always
kept
padlocked
abruptly
she
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
called
oh
tillie
i
going
outside
for
a
minute
i
come
back
all
right
agreed
the
girl
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
but
i
still
have
a
few
things
to
pick
up
leaving
by
the
side
door
penny
paused
on
the
porch
for
a
moment
carefully
she
glanced
about
the
yard
and
surrounding
fields
a
thin
quarter
moon
rising
over
the
pine
trees
gave
dim
shape
to
the
barn
and
silo
she
could
see
no
one
yet
tillie
revelation
that
strange
men
spied
upon
the
house
made
her
attentive
to
danger
swiftly
she
crossed
the
lawn
to
the
storm
cave
as
she
had
fully
expected
the
slanting
door
was
padlocked
oh
shoot
she
exclaimed
impatiently
i
want
to
get
down
there
she
jerked
at
the
padlock
several
times
and
then
accepting
the
situation
turned
toward
the
house
as
she
walked
penny
eyes
fastened
absently
upon
a
clump
of
lilac
bushes
some
twenty
yards
from
the
cave
they
were
moving
gently
as
if
stirred
by
a
wind
yet
there
was
no
wind
penny
did
not
pause
but
every
sense
became
alert
her
heart
pounded
distinctly
she
could
see
a
man
crawling
on
hands
and
knees
behind
the
lilacs
chapter
the
without
disclosing
by
her
actions
that
she
had
observed
anything
amiss
penny
walked
steadily
on
toward
the
house
her
first
thought
had
been
that
it
was
peter
fenestra
who
spied
upon
her
however
as
the
figure
straightened
she
knew
she
had
been
mistaken
the
man
was
not
fenestra
before
she
could
see
his
face
he
moved
to
another
clump
of
bushes
and
then
was
enveloped
by
darkness
entering
the
house
penny
blew
out
the
kerosene
lamp
and
stood
by
the
window
watching
she
could
not
see
the
man
he
had
vanished
completely
that
proves
that
tillie
was
correct
she
thought
this
house
being
watched
i
wonder
why
as
she
waited
tillie
came
down
the
stairway
carrying
her
luggage
observing
that
the
kitchen
was
dark
she
paused
in
alarm
it
all
right
penny
called
reassuringly
i
blew
the
light
out
so
that
i
would
be
seen
from
outside
is
anyone
there
tillie
demanded
coming
quickly
to
the
window
her
pallid
features
were
rigid
with
fear
and
her
breathing
quickened
he
gone
now
i
think
there
was
someone
a
moment
ago
yes
a
man
hiding
behind
the
lilacs
i
believe
he
must
have
been
watching
the
house
or
possibly
the
storm
cellar
then
you
see
i
was
right
tillie
declared
oh
this
is
a
dreadful
place
and
i
be
glad
to
leave
it
i
almost
wish
you
were
staying
said
penny
slowly
you
might
be
able
to
learn
what
hidden
in
that
cave
not
with
peter
fenestra
so
suspicious
anyway
you
could
hire
me
to
remain
even
if
he
would
allow
it
i
rather
starve
you
have
no
place
to
go
tillie
i
find
work
if
not
in
riverview
then
i
can
return
to
the
country
anything
will
be
better
than
what
i
had
penny
groped
in
the
dark
for
the
lamp
relighting
it
tillie
she
said
how
would
you
like
to
work
at
our
place
for
a
few
days
you
do
mean
it
i
do
if
it
can
be
arranged
penny
affirmed
we
have
a
housekeeper
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
she
might
take
your
place
here
she
be
very
foolish
to
give
up
a
good
job
for
this
it
would
only
be
temporary
i
think
i
can
induce
her
to
make
the
change
for
a
few
days
the
question
is
can
we
get
peter
fenestra
to
accept
her
i
doubt
if
he
hire
anyone
now
that
i
am
leaving
why
do
you
want
your
housekeeper
in
such
a
place
as
this
penny
only
for
one
reason
to
learn
what
going
on
here
i
confess
made
me
very
curious
about
the
storm
cave
fenestra
would
watch
her
every
minute
the
same
as
he
did
me
it
work
it
will
if
weems
can
get
the
job
declared
penny
confidently
first
of
all
we
must
make
fenestra
so
uncomfortable
he
want
someone
to
take
care
of
the
house
is
he
a
good
cook
oh
wretched
and
the
trick
of
keeping
a
good
fire
going
is
simply
beyond
him
why
if
we
turned
the
damper
it
never
would
occur
to
him
to
change
it
thanks
for
the
idea
laughed
penny
let
hide
the
breakfast
supplies
too
tillie
was
quite
certain
that
her
friend
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
but
she
offered
no
objection
to
the
plan
before
leaving
the
house
they
altered
the
stove
damper
hid
the
coffee
pot
and
placed
salt
in
the
sugar
bowl
if
old
peter
does
get
his
coffee
in
the
morning
he
simply
rave
chuckled
tillie
missing
it
may
be
the
one
thing
which
will
make
him
hire
a
new
housekeeper
the
girls
were
watchful
as
they
crossed
the
yard
but
they
observed
no
one
lurking
about
the
premises
evidently
the
man
who
had
hidden
behind
the
lilacs
had
taken
himself
elsewhere
penny
escorted
tillie
to
the
parked
automobile
leaving
her
there
while
she
went
to
the
cottage
for
weems
the
housekeeper
was
ready
and
waiting
by
the
time
she
arrived
penny
i
nearly
gave
you
up
she
sighed
why
did
it
take
so
long
i
been
busy
finding
you
a
new
position
chuckled
penny
starting
tomorrow
morning
you
to
work
for
peter
fenestra
instead
of
us
in
the
act
of
locking
the
cottage
door
weems
turned
to
face
the
girl
penny
she
said
i
am
tired
tonight
and
in
no
mood
for
your
jokes
this
is
a
joke
weems
i
really
do
want
you
to
change
jobs
with
tillie
fellows
you
remember
i
told
you
about
her
not
giving
the
housekeeper
an
opportunity
to
speak
she
rapidly
outlined
her
plan
early
tomorrow
morning
i
drive
you
to
fenestra
farm
she
ended
gleefully
you
to
knock
on
the
door
and
say
you
looking
for
a
job
at
very
low
wages
fenestra
will
be
so
desperate
he
welcome
you
with
open
arms
then
as
soon
as
he
off
his
guard
you
learn
what
is
hidden
in
the
storm
cave
how
lovely
said
weems
i
listened
to
your
crazy
schemes
for
years
penny
but
this
one
takes
the
prize
you
do
it
wo
you
i
certainly
will
not
the
housekeeper
spoke
with
biting
emphasis
oh
weems
penny
moaned
you
do
realize
how
much
this
means
to
me
if
only
you
go
there
i
may
be
able
to
get
a
wonderful
scoop
for
the
i
wish
you
never
had
started
that
paper
i
declare
ever
since
you
took
over
the
old
plant
you
done
the
wildest
things
this
is
wild
penny
argued
it
absolutely
logical
i
would
try
for
the
job
myself
only
i
know
fenestra
would
give
it
to
me
besides
i
am
kept
busy
at
the
plant
i
refuse
to
play
detective
for
you
penny
that
final
completely
downcast
penny
followed
weems
along
the
river
trail
however
she
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
so
easily
then
if
you
wo
she
remarked
i
must
take
tillie
to
a
charity
home
she
had
intended
to
start
working
at
our
place
the
girl
may
spend
the
night
with
us
if
you
like
we
have
an
extra
room
tillie
would
never
accept
such
a
favor
insisted
penny
more
than
anything
else
she
wants
a
job
weems
please
reconsider
it
a
crazy
scheme
no
it
is
penny
refuted
and
noting
indications
of
weakening
launched
into
another
lengthy
argument
weems
drew
a
deep
sigh
i
do
know
why
i
allow
you
to
twist
me
around
your
finger
the
way
you
do
you
try
for
the
job
i
suppose
so
but
what
will
your
father
say
he
call
it
clever
journalism
chuckled
penny
do
you
worry
about
dad
just
leave
everything
to
me
during
the
ride
to
riverview
weems
was
further
influenced
by
tillie
fellows
account
of
fenestra
peculiar
actions
gradually
she
began
to
share
penny
opinion
that
the
man
might
have
reason
to
fear
for
his
life
however
she
could
not
agree
with
the
girls
that
anything
of
great
value
was
hidden
in
the
cave
perhaps
we
wrong
penny
conceded
but
you
must
go
there
with
an
open
mind
weems
observe
everything
you
can
and
report
to
me
particularly
i
want
to
learn
what
fenestra
knows
about
john
munn
and
the
octopus
tattoo
i
sha
try
very
hard
to
get
the
job
threatened
the
housekeeper
at
seven
the
next
morning
penny
awakened
weems
from
a
sound
slumber
reminding
her
that
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
fenestra
farm
protesting
that
the
idea
seemed
crazier
than
ever
the
housekeeper
snuggled
down
beneath
the
covers
again
you
promised
you
would
go
reminded
penny
brutally
please
hurry
because
i
must
get
you
established
before
i
go
to
school
by
the
time
weems
was
dressed
breakfast
and
the
car
awaited
her
she
drank
the
bitterly
strong
coffee
and
still
protesting
allowed
penny
to
drive
her
within
view
of
the
fenestra
farm
is
that
the
place
she
inquired
with
distaste
as
the
automobile
halted
yes
i
do
dare
go
any
closer
for
fear
fenestra
will
see
me
you
know
the
story
you
to
tell
him
which
one
you
suggested
so
many
that
my
mind
is
then
make
it
simple
just
say
you
a
widow
out
of
work
and
that
you
a
wonderful
housekeeper
i
wait
here
if
you
go
inside
know
you
been
given
the
job
when
will
you
come
for
me
i
try
to
see
you
tomorrow
but
hold
the
fort
until
i
arrive
even
if
it
a
week
a
bundle
of
clothing
under
her
arm
weems
trudged
on
down
the
road
penny
watched
her
with
misgiving
the
adventure
was
not
to
the
housekeeper
liking
and
it
was
doubtful
that
her
application
for
work
would
be
an
enthusiastic
one
turning
the
car
in
the
road
she
pulled
to
one
side
and
waited
weems
had
reached
the
farmhouse
following
instructions
she
knocked
at
the
side
entrance
in
a
moment
or
two
the
door
was
opened
by
peter
fenestra
anxiously
penny
watched
the
interview
seemed
to
be
taking
a
long
while
but
at
least
fenestra
had
not
closed
the
door
in
the
housekeeper
face
then
to
her
delight
weems
followed
the
man
into
the
house
the
job
is
hers
she
thought
exultantly
if
she
does
fail
me
i
may
yet
break
an
important
story
in
my
paper
i
feel
in
my
bones
that
peter
fenestra
cave
soon
will
yield
its
secret
chapter
art
of
at
school
during
the
afternoon
assembly
period
penny
received
a
note
from
louise
which
read
the
is
in
urgent
need
of
feature
stories
for
our
next
issue
any
ideas
penny
scrawled
a
huge
zero
on
the
paper
decorated
it
with
angel
wings
and
sent
it
down
the
aisle
an
answer
came
immediately
you
have
to
do
something
about
it
all
of
our
reporters
are
taking
a
vacation
until
after
monthly
exams
ca
you
write
some
sort
of
story
penny
considered
the
problem
as
she
studied
her
history
lesson
just
as
the
dismissal
bell
rang
an
inspiration
seized
her
lou
i
do
have
an
idea
she
declared
linking
arms
with
her
chum
how
about
an
interview
with
ellis
saal
who
is
he
inquired
louise
somewhat
dubiously
a
tattoo
artist
who
has
a
little
shop
on
dorr
street
he
takes
passport
pictures
too
i
noticed
the
place
weeks
ago
what
makes
you
think
the
story
would
be
worth
printing
tattooing
is
a
fascinating
subject
it
is
to
you
i
doubt
if
our
readers
share
your
enthusiasm
they
will
when
they
read
my
story
countered
penny
early
the
next
morning
she
presented
herself
at
saal
place
of
business
a
crack
in
the
wall
barely
wide
enough
to
accommodate
a
door
pausing
she
stared
at
a
sign
which
proclaimed
that
for
a
nominal
sum
saal
would
tattoo
or
photograph
all
comers
in
a
glass
frame
were
displayed
many
samples
of
tattooing
bleeding
hearts
clasped
hands
sailing
ships
birds
in
flight
and
other
artistic
conceptions
penny
entered
the
shop
the
front
end
of
the
long
narrow
room
was
unoccupied
but
the
sound
of
hammering
led
her
to
the
rear
a
man
of
some
years
was
engaged
in
making
a
new
shelf
as
he
saw
her
the
hammer
dropped
from
his
hand
good
morning
said
penny
in
her
friendliest
tone
are
you
mr
saal
that
me
he
replied
regarding
her
curiously
excuse
me
for
bothering
you
apologized
penny
but
i
should
like
to
interview
you
for
my
newspaper
saal
intelligent
but
somewhat
eyes
fixed
her
in
a
steady
stare
a
reporter
he
said
finally
in
a
long
suffering
tone
they
respect
a
man
privacy
or
anything
else
for
that
matter
i
reckon
there
is
one
thing
i
am
sure
all
reporters
respect
saal
responded
penny
art
from
the
samples
of
your
work
which
i
saw
out
front
i
am
sure
you
are
a
great
tattoo
artist
saal
melted
like
a
lump
of
butter
on
a
hot
stove
penny
had
struck
his
weakest
spot
you
flatter
me
he
said
a
faint
pattern
of
a
smile
etching
his
face
i
admit
i
good
although
maybe
not
quite
the
best
in
the
business
what
do
you
want
to
know
a
story
about
the
tattooing
business
in
general
and
you
in
particular
saal
how
do
you
do
it
how
did
you
start
who
was
the
most
famous
person
you
ever
tattooed
what
is
your
favorite
design
do
you
think
a
tattoo
looks
better
on
the
arm
or
the
chest
what
hold
it
young
lady
hold
it
you
seem
to
be
a
living
question
mark
saal
motioned
for
penny
to
follow
him
to
the
front
of
the
shop
as
he
offered
her
a
chair
she
took
a
quick
glance
at
a
row
of
dirty
smeary
bottles
of
chemicals
on
a
shelf
above
her
head
now
let
take
your
first
question
said
saal
seating
himself
opposite
the
girl
i
ca
tell
you
how
to
tattoo
that
a
secret
of
the
profession
how
much
do
you
charge
for
one
depends
upon
how
much
a
fellow
is
willing
to
pay
take
this
town
it
a
cheap
place
nobody
has
any
money
the
king
of
england
paid
fifty
dollars
for
his
tattoo
and
what
do
i
get
i
lucky
if
it
a
dollar
and
mostly
hoodlums
to
work
on
you
ca
give
a
man
much
of
a
tattoo
for
a
dollar
do
you
ever
remove
tattoos
mr
saal
it
against
the
law
the
man
replied
briefly
i
did
know
that
said
penny
in
surprise
why
crooks
can
be
identified
by
their
tattoos
oh
it
easy
for
a
fellow
to
get
one
on
but
not
so
easy
to
get
it
off
but
it
can
be
done
penny
persisted
have
you
ever
removed
one
i
the
only
man
in
the
state
who
can
take
off
a
tattoo
so
it
show
boasted
saal
the
surgeons
have
tried
but
you
always
can
see
where
it
was
tell
me
about
some
of
the
tattoos
you
removed
urged
penny
i
told
you
more
than
i
should
now
said
saal
you
print
it
in
the
paper
and
then
i
get
into
trouble
with
the
police
this
will
be
strictly
confidential
promised
penny
it
this
way
saal
justified
himself
i
never
do
any
work
for
crooks
not
me
but
if
a
respectable
citizen
comes
here
and
says
he
sick
of
his
tattoo
then
sometimes
i
take
it
off
for
him
if
he
willing
to
pay
the
price
fact
is
i
workin
on
a
mighty
interesting
case
right
now
it
a
design
that
rare
an
octopus
penny
did
not
trust
herself
to
speak
for
a
moment
carefully
she
controlled
her
voice
as
she
said
casually
how
interesting
saal
an
octopus
tattoo
was
the
man
a
sailor
he
was
an
old
salt
all
right
though
he
denied
it
what
is
his
name
i
could
tell
you
that
answered
saal
i
have
to
protect
my
customers
tell
me
more
about
the
tattoo
urged
penny
it
just
a
figure
about
so
large
saal
demonstrated
with
his
hands
on
the
man
back
funny
place
for
a
tattoo
ai
it
i
should
say
so
agreed
penny
is
it
merely
a
figure
of
an
octopus
no
words
or
anything
like
that
there
are
two
words
i
took
off
last
week
two
inquired
penny
what
are
they
mr
saal
they
do
make
sense
the
words
are
i
once
saw
an
octopus
tattoo
such
as
you
describe
declared
penny
but
i
distinctly
recall
that
the
design
used
only
a
single
word
it
was
is
that
so
inquired
saal
maybe
the
tattoo
is
as
uncommon
as
i
thought
but
i
never
saw
one
like
it
before
i
wonder
what
can
be
the
significance
of
the
words
i
was
asking
my
customer
about
it
he
pretended
he
did
know
but
i
figure
maybe
he
and
some
buddies
had
a
sentence
tattooed
on
you
mean
that
if
one
were
able
to
read
several
tattoos
together
the
words
would
make
sense
that
right
nodded
saal
i
do
know
about
this
octopus
tattoo
but
i
figure
it
may
have
been
that
way
did
your
customer
have
any
other
tattoos
on
his
body
penny
questioned
an
anchor
for
instance
did
notice
if
he
did
i
suppose
it
takes
a
long
while
to
remove
a
tattoo
does
your
customer
come
often
every
tuesday
and
thursday
night
he
complains
because
i
do
do
the
work
faster
but
i
tell
him
if
he
wants
a
good
job
it
has
to
be
done
carefully
before
penny
could
ask
another
question
two
young
sailors
swaggered
into
the
shop
ellis
saal
scenting
business
immediately
arose
be
careful
what
you
write
up
he
warned
as
he
left
her
there
been
a
lot
of
articles
on
tattooin
but
not
a
one
that
right
it
just
possible
for
a
reporter
to
write
a
true
story
unless
it
about
a
murder
or
a
fire
i
be
careful
promised
penny
leaving
the
shop
she
walked
slowly
to
her
parked
car
the
information
obtained
from
the
tattoo
artist
both
excited
and
mystified
her
i
do
believe
saal
could
have
been
mistaken
about
the
words
which
were
incorporated
in
the
design
she
thought
and
i
equally
certain
i
was
mistaken
about
anchor
joe
tattoo
it
had
only
the
single
word
saal
declaration
that
his
customer
was
not
the
possessor
of
a
tattooed
anchor
caused
penny
to
wonder
if
the
person
could
be
joe
landa
however
the
man
was
wanted
by
government
agents
and
it
seemed
reasonable
to
believe
that
he
might
seek
to
remove
markings
i
know
what
i
do
she
decided
thursday
night
i
watch
shop
in
that
way
i
may
be
able
to
learn
the
identity
of
his
mysterious
customer
chapter
penny
compressed
the
facts
given
her
by
ellis
saal
into
a
brief
lively
feature
story
for
the
she
was
careful
not
to
divulge
that
the
man
had
removed
a
tattoo
from
a
customer
but
to
louise
she
confided
the
entire
story
all
unwittingly
saal
gave
me
just
the
clue
i
need
she
declared
enthusiastically
it
will
be
a
gigantic
step
forward
if
i
learn
the
identity
of
his
mysterious
customer
what
to
be
gained
by
it
asked
louise
as
she
slugged
a
story
and
speared
it
on
a
hook
what
will
be
proven
well
if
i
ever
going
to
solve
the
mystery
i
must
gather
every
fact
i
can
penny
said
defensively
i
aim
to
learn
the
meaning
of
those
strange
tattoos
and
above
all
the
reason
why
john
munn
was
pushed
from
the
bridge
you
have
your
work
cut
out
for
you
responded
louise
dryly
but
saal
information
helps
you
remember
i
told
you
that
john
munn
tattoo
bore
the
word
anchor
joe
was
exactly
the
same
except
for
the
word
and
now
ellis
saal
has
a
customer
with
two
words
on
his
back
why
i
believe
i
have
it
penny
sprang
from
her
chair
eyes
dancing
with
excitement
you
have
what
asked
louise
calmly
it
came
to
me
like
a
flash
the
meaning
of
those
tattooed
words
if
we
have
been
dumb
kindly
stop
jumping
around
and
explain
saal
told
me
he
thought
several
sailors
might
have
had
a
sentence
incorporated
in
their
tattoo
that
is
only
a
word
or
two
was
used
in
each
design
but
taken
as
a
whole
it
would
make
sense
and
you
think
you
have
the
phrase
i
do
louise
why
could
it
be
for
one
one
for
if
the
men
were
close
friends
that
would
be
fairly
logical
but
the
words
we
have
to
juggle
do
make
such
a
sentence
penny
obviously
there
must
be
a
fourth
sailor
whose
tattoo
includes
the
words
all
argued
penny
then
it
would
fit
perfectly
just
because
four
men
were
pals
you
think
they
would
have
such
nonsense
tattooed
on
their
backs
that
my
theory
if
you
right
then
the
mystery
is
solved
far
from
it
corrected
penny
i
have
learned
who
pushed
john
munn
from
the
bridge
or
why
you
remember
how
anchor
joe
talked
about
someone
who
had
the
four
of
them
must
have
been
in
on
a
scheme
and
one
man
betrayed
his
comrades
better
bridle
that
imagination
before
it
takes
you
for
too
wild
a
ride
chuckled
louise
then
you
think
there
nothing
to
my
theory
penny
demanded
in
an
injured
tone
i
think
that
if
you
speculate
upon
it
much
longer
we
never
get
any
work
done
louise
replied
turning
once
more
to
her
typewriter
these
headlines
must
be
composed
if
ever
we
expect
to
get
another
paper
on
the
street
disappointed
that
her
chum
did
not
take
the
matter
more
seriously
penny
went
to
consult
old
horney
in
the
composing
room
the
pressman
had
proven
to
be
worth
many
times
the
small
salary
which
the
girls
paid
him
not
only
had
he
made
the
rotary
presses
ready
for
service
but
he
had
cleaned
and
oiled
every
useable
piece
of
machinery
in
the
building
eagerly
he
awaited
the
day
when
penny
would
print
the
in
her
own
plant
everything
all
set
he
told
her
with
a
worshipful
grin
whenever
you
give
the
word
we
can
go
to
press
that
fine
penny
praised
louise
and
i
have
been
having
a
few
difficulties
financial
and
otherwise
but
i
hope
it
wo
be
long
now
she
talked
with
old
horney
about
various
technical
problems
then
returned
to
her
desk
slipping
a
sheet
of
paper
into
her
typewriter
she
composed
a
letter
to
a
well
known
steamship
the
slipping
it
into
her
pocket
she
opened
the
door
of
louise
office
do
you
mind
staying
here
alone
for
awhile
no
of
course
not
where
are
you
going
to
mail
an
important
letter
then
i
want
to
drive
out
to
fenestra
farm
and
see
mrs
weems
i
look
after
everything
until
you
get
back
louise
promised
she
glanced
curiously
at
the
letter
but
did
not
ask
to
whom
it
was
directed
penny
dropped
the
stamped
envelope
into
a
convenient
corner
mailbox
and
then
drove
toward
the
outskirts
of
the
city
nearing
drexel
boulevard
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
she
never
had
found
time
to
revisit
matthew
judson
home
pauletta
owes
me
an
explanation
for
the
way
she
acted
the
other
day
she
thought
i
have
a
notion
to
stop
and
see
if
she
alone
penny
impulsively
spun
the
wheel
and
followed
the
boulevard
to
the
judson
home
the
iron
gate
stood
open
she
drove
through
up
the
curve
of
cement
to
the
house
in
response
to
her
knock
an
untidy
colored
maid
admitted
her
to
a
dark
dusty
living
room
as
she
awaited
pauletta
her
wandering
gaze
noted
a
number
of
significant
details
the
walls
had
not
been
decorated
in
many
years
upholstered
furniture
had
assumed
a
appearance
and
the
entire
room
seemed
spiritless
pauletta
came
slowly
down
the
circular
stairway
she
hesitated
as
she
recognized
penny
but
could
not
retreat
how
do
you
do
she
said
somewhat
stiffly
nice
of
you
to
call
i
think
you
know
why
i
came
said
penny
we
were
unable
to
talk
when
i
was
here
before
i
told
you
all
there
was
to
it
pauletta
declared
seating
herself
opposite
the
girl
frankly
i
ca
see
that
the
affair
is
any
of
your
concern
i
wore
the
disguise
because
i
did
wish
to
be
recognized
on
board
the
your
explanation
is
very
satisfactory
i
afraid
tillie
fellows
is
staying
at
our
home
now
what
of
it
she
was
robbed
that
night
on
the
boat
we
discussed
it
before
miss
judson
said
in
exasperation
you
insult
me
by
suggesting
that
i
may
have
snatched
the
girl
pocketbook
why
should
i
steal
when
my
father
is
wealthy
i
always
had
everything
i
want
i
should
like
very
much
to
believe
you
said
penny
quietly
but
unless
you
are
willing
to
offer
a
complete
explanation
i
am
afraid
i
ca
very
well
if
i
must
i
tell
miss
judson
replied
angrily
you
may
have
read
in
the
newspapers
that
i
am
engaged
to
marry
major
howard
atchley
the
story
escaped
me
i
admire
howard
very
much
resumed
pauletta
still
in
an
icy
tone
he
comes
from
an
excellent
family
is
and
in
father
opinion
will
make
me
a
good
husband
your
opinion
differs
penny
inquired
softly
i
do
not
love
howard
and
i
never
shall
on
the
night
you
saw
me
aboard
the
i
had
gone
with
another
friend
of
mine
carl
feldman
intending
to
enjoy
the
excursion
trip
your
father
knew
nothing
about
it
i
told
him
i
was
going
with
another
girl
oh
i
see
there
was
nothing
wrong
about
it
pauletta
said
irritably
but
fairly
well
known
i
realized
that
if
i
were
recognized
father
or
howard
might
learn
about
it
then
there
would
be
trouble
for
howard
is
a
very
jealous
person
so
you
resorted
to
the
wig
and
glasses
yes
that
was
my
sole
reason
major
atchley
met
me
at
the
boat
before
joining
him
i
threw
the
bundle
of
clothing
into
the
river
now
are
you
satisfied
with
my
explanation
i
am
said
penny
in
fact
i
never
believed
that
you
had
robbed
tillie
you
certainly
acted
that
way
perhaps
i
only
wanted
to
learn
the
truth
miss
judson
did
not
reply
her
cold
stare
made
it
evident
that
she
disliked
penny
and
regarded
her
as
a
meddler
is
there
anything
else
you
wish
to
know
she
asked
after
a
lengthy
silence
nothing
miss
judson
i
was
only
thinking
that
i
would
like
to
help
you
and
your
father
thank
you
we
do
require
assistance
perhaps
you
do
said
penny
but
your
father
needs
friends
he
admitted
to
me
that
if
it
were
for
you
he
would
be
tempted
to
end
everything
the
words
stunned
pauletta
father
never
said
that
she
exclaimed
he
did
i
ca
believe
it
why
father
the
most
cheerful
person
in
the
world
in
your
presence
possibly
the
loss
of
the
must
have
been
a
heavy
blow
to
him
father
was
forced
to
give
up
the
paper
pauletta
protested
he
did
it
because
he
was
tired
of
working
so
hard
was
that
what
he
told
you
why
yes
i
know
of
no
other
reason
the
general
belief
seems
to
be
that
your
father
speculated
on
the
stock
market
losing
large
sums
of
money
that
ca
be
true
denied
pauletta
to
my
knowledge
father
never
gambled
he
may
have
bought
a
few
stocks
from
time
to
time
but
only
for
investment
then
you
feel
sure
he
did
not
dispose
of
the
because
he
needed
money
pauletta
hesitated
before
she
answered
it
never
occurred
to
me
before
but
father
has
been
rather
close
the
past
year
i
thought
it
was
sheer
carelessness
when
he
let
this
place
run
down
he
always
gave
me
everything
i
wanted
why
does
he
favor
your
marriage
to
the
major
perhaps
money
does
enter
into
it
pauletta
said
slowly
many
times
father
has
reminded
me
that
i
would
have
every
luxury
as
howard
wife
your
friend
carl
is
poor
he
has
a
fairly
good
position
but
not
much
money
father
always
seemed
to
like
carl
that
was
why
i
could
understand
when
he
asked
me
not
to
see
him
again
i
am
sure
your
father
thinks
only
of
your
welfare
but
i
would
rather
marry
carl
and
be
poor
always
than
to
have
riches
with
howard
you
not
told
your
father
that
why
no
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
money
had
influenced
him
there
another
rumor
said
penny
i
suppose
i
should
mention
it
i
wish
you
would
i
heard
it
said
that
your
father
disposed
of
the
because
he
had
been
blackmailed
by
whom
i
have
the
slightest
idea
it
was
only
a
rumor
there
may
be
truth
in
it
pauletta
replied
in
a
low
voice
opened
my
eyes
miss
parker
i
been
very
blind
then
you
think
someone
may
have
forced
your
father
to
pay
money
i
do
know
but
father
has
acted
strangely
ever
since
he
gave
up
the
paper
once
a
month
on
the
fourth
he
receives
a
visit
from
a
queer
looking
man
always
he
tries
to
get
me
out
of
the
house
before
the
fellow
comes
do
you
know
his
name
no
father
has
never
told
me
the
man
seldom
stays
longer
than
ten
minutes
can
you
describe
him
not
very
well
because
i
never
saw
him
at
close
range
i
should
say
dark
and
cruel
looking
not
at
all
the
sort
father
would
choose
for
a
friend
your
father
offers
no
explanation
as
to
why
the
man
comes
none
he
refuses
to
discuss
the
subject
i
noticed
though
that
for
days
after
the
fellow
leaves
he
very
nervous
and
uneasy
excuse
me
for
asking
so
many
questions
miss
judson
but
do
you
know
of
any
reason
why
your
father
might
be
blackmailed
no
i
do
i
am
sure
he
never
been
involved
in
anything
dishonorable
penny
had
no
more
to
tell
and
she
was
convinced
that
pauletta
had
given
a
truthful
account
of
the
situation
feeling
that
she
was
not
particularly
welcome
she
arose
to
leave
i
am
glad
you
came
pauletta
said
extending
her
hand
please
excuse
my
rudeness
there
were
so
many
things
i
failed
to
understand
you
must
forgive
me
too
replied
penny
i
did
mean
to
meddle
i
truly
want
to
help
your
father
i
wish
i
could
help
him
too
said
pauletta
in
a
troubled
voice
in
the
past
i
fear
i
been
very
selfish
and
inconsiderate
there
a
way
to
help
if
you
willing
to
do
it
i
do
understand
you
say
that
on
the
fourth
of
each
month
a
man
comes
here
to
see
your
father
if
you
tried
could
you
learn
his
name
i
might
drop
in
upon
them
at
an
awkward
moment
compelling
father
to
introduce
me
are
you
willing
to
do
it
why
yes
but
i
fail
to
see
what
will
be
gained
perhaps
nothing
perhaps
a
great
deal
replied
penny
if
the
man
is
a
blackmailer
it
should
help
for
us
to
know
his
name
i
learn
what
i
can
then
until
the
fourth
and
please
not
a
word
to
judson
we
must
work
secretly
reflecting
upon
the
information
given
her
by
pauletta
penny
drove
on
toward
peter
fenestra
home
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
she
parked
the
car
and
set
off
afoot
hoping
to
attract
no
attention
should
the
owner
be
at
home
it
was
well
that
she
took
the
precaution
she
was
three
hundred
yards
from
the
grounds
when
suddenly
she
saw
a
man
emerge
from
behind
the
barn
at
a
glance
she
observed
that
he
was
too
short
to
be
peter
fenestra
as
penny
paused
to
watch
the
man
moved
stealthily
across
the
yard
to
the
front
door
of
the
farmhouse
his
face
turned
slightly
in
her
direction
and
she
recognized
anchor
joe
what
can
he
be
doing
here
she
thought
in
amazement
the
question
soon
was
answered
glancing
quickly
about
anchor
joe
dropped
a
white
envelope
on
the
front
porch
then
he
pounded
several
times
on
the
door
before
darting
to
the
shelter
of
the
lilac
bushes
chapter
weems
several
minutes
elapsed
before
the
door
was
opened
by
peter
fenestra
he
glanced
alertly
about
the
yard
and
then
his
gaze
fell
upon
the
envelope
penny
heard
him
mutter
to
himself
as
he
picked
it
up
fenestra
face
became
convulsed
with
rage
as
he
tore
open
the
flap
and
saw
the
message
still
muttering
he
crumpled
the
paper
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
entering
the
house
he
slammed
the
door
with
peter
at
home
penny
dared
not
try
to
see
weems
as
she
hesitated
debating
anchor
joe
came
from
his
hiding
place
he
did
not
see
the
girl
joe
she
called
softly
the
sailor
turned
recognizing
her
he
ran
in
the
opposite
direction
across
the
yard
keeping
low
behind
a
hedge
he
started
toward
the
river
joe
come
back
penny
called
again
paying
no
heed
the
sailor
fled
through
the
fields
soon
he
was
hidden
by
tall
trees
and
bushes
penny
felt
deeply
disturbed
wondering
if
anchor
joe
made
a
practice
of
watching
the
fenestra
home
she
was
inclined
to
believe
that
this
had
not
been
his
first
visit
there
unexpectedly
the
farmhouse
door
swung
open
penny
barely
had
time
to
step
behind
a
large
maple
before
peter
fenestra
came
down
the
path
he
went
directly
to
the
barn
and
a
few
minutes
later
backed
out
his
automobile
good
thought
penny
he
likely
driving
to
riverview
now
i
can
talk
to
weems
without
fear
of
interruption
as
soon
as
the
car
had
disappeared
down
the
main
road
she
ran
to
the
kitchen
door
and
knocked
when
it
was
not
opened
immediately
she
thrust
her
head
inside
and
called
the
housekeeper
name
here
i
am
answered
weems
hurrying
from
the
dining
room
i
hope
you
come
to
take
me
home
penny
parker
no
only
to
receive
your
report
penny
sank
into
a
chair
beside
the
stove
you
do
act
very
pleased
with
your
new
job
it
a
dreadful
place
i
was
crazy
to
say
i
would
stay
here
have
you
learned
anything
i
learned
that
peter
fenestra
is
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
men
i
ever
met
in
my
life
there
no
satisfying
him
he
requires
a
slave
not
a
housekeeper
but
what
about
the
storm
cave
penny
asked
were
you
able
to
find
out
what
fenestra
stores
in
it
of
course
not
the
padlock
always
is
locked
and
he
keeps
the
key
in
his
pocket
but
he
does
have
something
hidden
there
penny
questioned
eagerly
he
goes
down
into
it
at
night
i
seen
him
enter
the
cave
once
since
i
came
here
when
was
that
last
night
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
i
heard
the
door
close
so
i
went
to
the
window
and
watched
how
long
did
he
stay
there
mrs
weems
about
three
hours
i
judge
it
was
after
two
when
he
returned
to
his
room
what
he
have
hidden
in
the
cave
nothing
in
my
opinion
declared
weems
i
think
he
cooks
something
at
least
he
builds
a
fire
what
makes
you
think
that
i
could
see
smoke
seeping
out
from
the
cracks
of
the
cave
door
penny
frowned
i
ca
guess
what
he
could
be
cooking
she
said
surely
he
does
have
a
still
down
there
i
doubt
it
very
much
probably
you
built
up
a
great
mystery
about
nothing
pouring
hot
water
over
the
dishes
weems
began
to
wash
them
penny
picked
up
a
towel
and
automatically
wiped
and
stacked
them
away
i
did
imagine
that
this
house
was
being
watched
she
replied
only
a
few
minutes
ago
i
saw
anchor
joe
steal
to
the
door
and
leave
a
letter
for
mr
fenestra
anchor
joe
moyer
never
caught
him
it
seems
but
why
should
the
fellow
come
here
what
message
did
he
leave
fenestra
i
heard
a
knock
on
the
front
door
weems
admitted
fenestra
answered
it
and
when
he
came
back
into
the
kitchen
he
was
in
a
dreadful
temper
the
letter
upset
him
i
did
know
he
had
received
one
yes
anchor
joe
left
it
on
the
doorstep
it
may
have
been
a
threatening
note
i
give
a
lot
to
know
fenestra
has
been
very
nervous
since
i
came
here
weems
contributed
if
he
hears
any
unusual
sound
in
the
yard
he
immediately
becomes
alert
as
if
he
were
afraid
for
his
life
yes
he
does
act
that
way
i
doubt
if
he
stay
here
much
longer
his
clothes
are
all
packed
in
suitcases
that
important
information
declared
penny
oh
dear
if
only
we
knew
why
he
being
threatened
and
why
he
intends
to
leave
i
believe
i
go
upstairs
and
inspect
his
room
you
learn
nothing
there
responded
weems
fenestra
is
a
careful
man
he
leaves
no
papers
lying
about
it
will
do
no
harm
to
look
penny
climbed
the
creaking
stairs
and
was
followed
by
weems
this
is
his
room
said
the
housekeeper
opening
a
door
i
have
made
the
bed
yet
she
busied
herself
smoothing
covers
while
penny
wandered
about
the
room
had
no
rug
it
was
furnished
with
an
old
fashioned
dresser
a
wash
stand
and
a
bed
with
a
high
headboard
penny
opened
the
closet
door
the
hangers
were
dangling
together
without
clothing
everything
had
been
packed
into
two
suitcases
which
stood
against
the
wall
i
already
inspected
the
luggage
said
weems
as
the
girl
bent
to
open
one
of
the
bags
you
find
nothing
except
clothing
i
tell
you
peter
fenestra
is
a
very
cautious
man
i
can
believe
it
agreed
penny
this
room
is
as
bare
of
evidence
as
mother
hubbard
cupboard
just
what
do
you
hope
to
find
well
i
do
know
what
this
penny
picked
up
a
sheet
of
notebook
paper
from
the
dresser
do
get
excited
over
that
laughed
weems
it
only
a
grocery
list
which
fenestra
made
up
he
does
trust
anyone
to
spend
his
money
for
him
is
this
fenestra
writing
penny
studied
the
paper
with
intense
interest
yes
it
is
weems
i
seen
this
writing
before
penny
exclaimed
i
almost
certain
of
it
there
a
marked
resemblance
a
resemblance
to
what
penny
why
to
a
threatening
note
i
received
i
guess
i
never
told
you
someone
left
a
message
on
my
desk
at
the
newspaper
office
warning
me
to
give
up
my
paper
and
you
think
peter
fenestra
left
it
there
inquired
the
housekeeper
smiling
this
looks
like
the
same
writing
probably
you
are
mistaken
penny
why
should
he
have
any
interest
in
your
paper
he
came
to
the
office
one
day
questioning
me
about
a
story
i
ran
concerning
john
munn
i
shall
keep
this
and
compare
it
with
the
note
carefully
folding
the
paper
penny
slipped
it
into
her
dress
pocket
weems
had
finished
making
the
bed
and
was
ready
to
leave
i
learned
everything
i
can
for
you
she
said
now
i
hope
willing
to
let
me
return
home
please
stay
another
day
pleaded
penny
i
feel
in
my
bones
that
about
to
make
an
important
discovery
those
bones
of
yours
complained
the
housekeeper
tell
me
how
is
tillie
fellows
getting
along
well
she
tries
hard
but
i
admit
dad
does
like
the
arrangement
then
i
must
return
it
nonsense
for
me
to
stay
here
penny
was
paying
no
attention
to
weems
words
she
had
picked
up
the
waste
paper
basket
and
was
examining
the
contents
there
were
a
few
advertising
circulars
an
unaddressed
envelope
and
a
crumpled
ball
of
paper
the
latter
penny
carefully
smoothed
mrs
weems
she
exclaimed
look
at
this
the
housekeeper
hastened
to
her
side
curiously
she
examined
the
paper
it
bore
no
writing
only
a
crude
drawing
of
an
octopus
this
must
be
the
paper
which
anchor
joe
left
on
the
doorstep
only
a
few
minutes
ago
cried
penny
excitedly
you
think
it
may
have
been
intended
as
a
warning
to
peter
fenestra
the
housekeeper
regarded
the
drawing
rather
dubiously
i
sure
of
it
weems
do
you
see
the
drawing
is
a
copy
of
the
tattoo
which
both
anchor
joe
and
john
munn
had
on
their
backs
yes
it
does
look
the
same
as
joe
marking
conceded
the
housekeeper
but
what
does
it
mean
why
was
it
sent
to
fenestra
i
wish
i
knew
one
thing
is
clear
that
boatman
your
father
hired
is
a
downright
scamp
he
wanted
by
the
government
we
know
that
but
fenestra
may
be
a
rascal
too
why
should
anchor
joe
threaten
him
unless
he
done
something
he
should
why
indeed
this
is
a
case
for
the
police
not
one
for
you
or
me
declared
weems
with
finality
i
am
ready
to
leave
here
whenever
you
are
i
decided
not
to
bother
giving
fenestra
notice
you
ca
go
now
you
ca
moaned
penny
stay
until
after
thursday
at
least
i
positive
everything
will
be
cleared
up
by
then
why
thursday
well
i
have
a
little
matter
coming
up
on
that
day
besides
i
sent
off
a
letter
which
may
help
solve
the
mystery
please
weems
do
this
one
favor
and
i
never
ask
another
until
next
time
you
mean
but
to
please
you
i
stay
until
friday
not
a
day
longer
however
i
warn
you
if
i
see
anchor
joe
prowling
about
i
shall
summon
the
sheriff
that
all
right
with
me
grinned
penny
i
must
skip
now
before
fenestra
gets
back
from
town
just
keep
your
eye
on
him
and
report
to
me
if
anything
unusual
happens
chapter
by
penny
had
never
found
it
necessary
to
explain
fully
to
her
father
what
had
become
of
weems
she
had
mentioned
rather
carelessly
that
the
housekeeper
was
helping
out
at
the
fenestra
home
for
a
few
days
and
he
had
accepted
the
substitution
of
tillie
fellows
without
too
many
questions
at
breakfast
on
wednesday
morning
the
publisher
waited
until
tillie
had
gone
to
the
kitchen
and
then
asked
in
an
undertone
how
much
longer
is
this
to
continue
when
is
weems
coming
home
friday
morning
dad
do
you
like
tillie
cooking
it
awful
he
whispered
these
eggs
taste
as
if
they
had
been
fried
in
lard
they
were
chuckled
penny
tillie
was
brought
up
to
be
frugal
she
never
wastes
butter
the
discussion
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
end
by
the
appearance
of
tillie
parker
immediately
switched
to
another
subject
that
of
a
barbecue
picnic
which
he
gave
each
summer
to
the
employes
penny
had
forgotten
that
the
outing
was
scheduled
for
that
night
at
the
cottage
i
glad
you
reminded
me
dad
she
said
i
be
there
with
bells
to
eat
my
share
of
roast
beef
mind
if
i
bring
old
horney
invite
him
if
you
like
replied
parker
but
no
others
this
is
a
newspaper
picnic
not
a
bread
line
as
you
made
it
last
year
after
school
that
afternoon
penny
worked
as
usual
at
the
office
she
was
busy
figuring
advertising
space
when
she
glanced
up
and
saw
fred
clousky
standing
in
the
doorway
are
are
you
busy
asked
the
boy
diffidently
yes
i
am
said
penny
with
discouraging
brevity
i
do
want
to
bother
you
fred
murmured
but
i
was
wondering
do
you
have
a
job
for
me
around
here
i
like
to
work
on
a
real
paper
being
editor
of
is
okay
but
you
do
get
any
practical
experience
oh
so
you
want
a
job
inquired
penny
inclined
to
give
him
a
short
answer
she
thought
better
of
it
everything
considered
she
said
what
you
need
fred
is
to
learn
about
different
kinds
of
type
it
so
easy
to
get
and
various
headlines
mixed
fred
kept
his
gaze
on
his
shoes
i
have
just
the
job
for
you
resumed
penny
you
can
sort
and
clean
the
type
when
it
broken
out
of
the
page
forms
if
you
do
that
well
perhaps
you
can
work
up
later
on
when
do
i
start
fred
asked
in
a
crushed
voice
penny
was
surprised
for
she
had
expected
him
to
decline
such
a
dirty
menial
job
in
a
far
more
friendly
tone
she
directed
him
to
seek
old
horney
who
would
be
found
in
the
composing
room
fred
is
so
bad
after
all
she
thought
after
he
had
gone
i
give
him
an
office
job
next
week
penny
returned
to
her
work
in
need
of
an
extra
sheet
of
paper
she
tried
to
open
the
lower
drawer
of
her
desk
it
was
stuck
fast
she
tugged
at
it
several
times
finally
pulling
it
out
entirely
a
folded
newspaper
clipping
dropped
to
the
floor
wondering
what
it
might
be
she
picked
it
up
the
torn
sheet
yellow
with
age
bore
the
picture
of
a
young
man
the
face
was
vaguely
familiar
although
the
name
beneath
it
read
matthew
jewel
matthew
jewel
she
whispered
but
it
matthew
judson
judson
as
a
young
man
he
must
have
changed
his
name
the
two
column
headline
drew
her
attention
matthew
jewel
begins
ten
year
sentence
in
new
york
prison
for
misappropriation
of
bank
funds
the
clipping
she
noted
had
been
cut
from
a
new
york
paper
and
was
dated
twenty
years
earlier
it
reported
matthew
jewel
conviction
following
an
admission
that
he
had
stolen
two
thousand
dollars
belonging
to
the
berkley
savings
bank
penny
studied
the
picture
again
not
the
slightest
doubt
entered
her
mind
that
the
young
man
of
the
story
and
matthew
judson
were
the
same
individual
evidently
the
clipping
had
been
saved
by
the
former
publisher
and
in
some
manner
had
become
lodged
beneath
the
drawer
i
sure
no
one
in
riverview
ever
knew
that
judson
served
a
term
in
prison
she
thought
he
came
here
years
ago
with
his
daughter
and
to
all
appearances
had
led
an
upright
life
after
perusing
the
item
again
she
returned
it
to
the
drawer
which
she
carefully
locked
she
knew
that
the
information
was
of
utmost
importance
was
it
not
possible
that
she
had
stumbled
upon
a
motivation
for
strange
behavior
of
the
past
year
could
not
the
data
contained
in
the
clipping
have
provided
an
unscrupulous
person
with
a
basis
for
blackmail
but
why
should
judson
ruin
his
career
rather
than
face
exposure
she
reflected
other
men
have
made
mistakes
in
their
youth
and
started
over
again
the
truth
might
have
humiliated
him
but
riverview
people
would
have
taken
a
charitable
attitude
deeply
troubled
penny
gathered
together
her
belongings
and
went
in
search
of
old
horney
finding
him
initiating
fred
clousky
in
his
new
duties
she
discreetly
invited
him
to
attend
the
picnic
thank
you
mightily
responded
the
pressman
but
i
not
dressed
for
it
these
pants
are
so
shiny
you
could
use
for
a
mirror
do
you
worry
about
your
clothes
horney
besides
it
will
be
so
dark
no
one
will
notice
dad
gave
you
a
special
invitation
did
he
now
the
old
pressman
could
not
hide
his
pleasure
well
if
you
think
he
really
wants
me
maybe
i
go
you
wash
up
while
i
get
the
car
penny
urged
we
rather
late
within
ten
minutes
old
horney
met
her
at
the
front
entrance
his
hair
was
combed
he
wore
a
frayed
coat
and
had
contrived
to
polish
his
shoes
horney
penny
said
abruptly
as
they
drove
toward
the
river
did
you
ever
hear
that
matthew
judson
had
been
in
trouble
before
he
gave
up
his
paper
you
mean
financial
the
pressman
inquired
no
i
meant
of
a
personal
nature
i
been
thinking
over
your
theory
that
judson
was
blackmailed
maybe
i
ought
to
have
said
what
i
did
it
was
just
my
own
idea
i
inclined
to
believe
there
may
be
something
to
it
horney
now
supposing
that
judson
had
stolen
money
or
had
been
in
prison
it
could
have
been
that
interrupted
the
pressman
why
judson
was
so
honest
he
bent
over
backwards
penny
was
tempted
to
tell
horney
about
the
clipping
but
refrained
from
doing
so
however
she
was
satisfied
that
employes
of
the
had
gained
no
inkling
of
judson
prison
record
the
picnic
was
well
under
way
by
the
time
penny
and
the
pressman
arrived
at
the
river
cottage
a
caterer
had
taken
complete
charge
and
with
his
crew
of
helpers
prepared
to
serve
nearly
two
hundred
boisterous
hungry
newspaper
employes
always
a
favorite
penny
immediately
was
surrounded
by
a
group
of
friends
assured
that
horney
had
found
welcome
with
pressmen
acquaintances
she
entered
wholeheartedly
into
the
frivolity
jerry
livingston
frowning
away
all
other
young
men
became
her
escort
for
the
evening
after
supper
had
been
served
he
guided
her
firmly
away
from
the
group
we
do
want
to
hear
any
speeches
he
said
let
go
look
at
the
moon
ca
we
see
it
here
countered
penny
a
moon
to
be
appreciated
properly
must
be
seen
from
a
sandy
beach
chuckled
jerry
preferably
from
a
nice
comfortable
shoulder
breaking
away
penny
raced
ahead
of
him
along
the
beach
to
the
suspension
bridge
she
was
halfway
across
when
he
overtook
her
rocking
it
so
violently
that
she
had
to
cling
to
him
for
support
stop
that
jerry
livingston
you
break
the
bridge
then
do
try
to
run
away
from
me
will
you
let
me
show
you
the
moon
no
i
know
you
jerry
you
show
it
to
all
the
girls
if
i
do
it
just
as
a
rehearsal
you
see
penny
i
hoped
that
someday
i
might
get
a
chance
to
show
it
to
you
what
a
line
you
have
laughed
penny
but
i
wo
play
as
a
your
technique
is
terrible
better
practice
some
more
jerry
chuckled
and
slipping
his
hand
in
hers
led
her
on
across
the
bridge
if
you
wo
look
at
the
moon
he
said
then
take
a
squint
at
old
man
river
i
believe
i
prefer
the
moon
after
all
penny
returned
raising
her
eyes
to
the
disc
of
light
sailing
serenely
through
the
sky
it
beautiful
her
reverie
was
broken
by
jerry
voice
his
hand
tightened
on
her
own
penny
he
exclaimed
look
over
there
farther
down
the
river
in
an
open
space
the
forms
of
two
struggling
men
were
silhouetted
in
the
moonlight
oh
jerry
penny
cried
they
fighting
and
to
the
death
added
jerry
grimly
come
on
before
it
too
late
chapter
saal
penny
followed
the
reporter
quickly
overtaking
him
their
pounding
footsteps
were
heard
by
the
two
men
who
abruptly
ceased
their
desperate
struggles
observing
the
pair
they
turned
and
fled
one
toward
the
river
the
other
toward
the
road
well
we
broke
that
up
in
a
hurry
exclaimed
jerry
wonder
what
made
them
run
they
must
have
been
afraid
we
would
recognize
them
answered
penny
did
you
think
that
one
man
looked
like
peter
fenestra
i
never
have
seen
him
to
my
knowledge
he
was
the
fellow
who
ran
along
the
river
no
the
other
fenestra
farmhouse
is
across
the
fields
penny
pointed
toward
a
light
shining
dimly
from
a
window
they
both
disappeared
now
jerry
commented
moving
to
the
river
bank
wonder
how
the
row
started
anyway
fenestra
has
been
threatened
revealed
penny
yesterday
anchor
joe
left
a
drawing
of
an
octopus
on
his
doorstep
what
was
the
idea
it
must
have
been
intended
as
a
warning
of
some
sort
anchor
joe
and
other
men
too
keep
watch
of
the
house
how
did
you
learn
that
penny
i
made
observations
besides
tillie
fellows
who
worked
there
told
me
what
she
had
seen
fenestra
is
afraid
for
his
life
maybe
it
was
anchor
joe
who
attacked
him
tonight
it
may
have
been
i
wish
we
could
have
seen
those
men
at
close
range
penny
walked
on
to
the
clearing
where
the
pair
had
fought
grass
had
been
beaten
down
over
a
large
area
indicating
that
the
struggle
had
not
been
a
brief
one
a
shiny
object
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
penny
picked
it
up
then
called
softly
to
jerry
who
had
remained
by
the
river
bank
what
is
it
he
asked
coming
quickly
to
her
side
i
found
a
key
jerry
it
was
lying
here
on
the
ground
one
of
the
men
must
have
lost
it
from
his
pocket
this
may
have
been
what
they
were
fighting
over
jerry
what
makes
you
think
that
does
the
key
look
as
if
it
belonged
to
a
padlock
yes
it
does
penny
then
i
am
convinced
this
key
will
fit
the
lock
on
peter
fenestra
storm
cellar
his
attacker
was
trying
to
get
it
away
from
him
just
a
minute
remonstrated
jerry
you
traveling
too
fast
for
me
explain
the
storm
cellar
part
you
promise
not
to
use
anything
i
tell
you
for
the
that
fair
enough
satisfied
that
jerry
would
keep
his
promise
penny
told
him
everything
she
had
learned
at
the
fenestra
farm
the
reporter
asked
many
questions
about
the
storm
cave
so
you
believe
this
key
may
unlock
the
door
he
mused
i
like
to
try
it
at
least
now
there
never
will
be
a
better
time
weems
thinks
that
fenestra
is
getting
ready
to
leave
riverview
jerry
hesitated
only
briefly
all
right
i
with
you
he
said
lead
the
way
they
were
leaving
the
river
when
both
were
startled
to
hear
the
suspension
bridge
creak
beneath
human
weight
as
they
paused
listening
a
familiar
voice
called
jerry
hey
jerry
here
responded
the
reporter
a
figure
emerged
from
the
trees
and
they
recognized
salt
sommers
the
photographer
say
i
been
lookin
everywhere
for
you
he
complained
wanted
back
in
riverview
what
is
this
a
gag
jerry
asked
suspiciously
it
no
gag
the
fulton
powder
company
just
blew
up
joe
and
gus
and
philips
are
already
on
their
way
dewitt
sent
me
to
get
you
the
fulton
powder
plant
jerry
exclaimed
falling
into
step
with
salt
that
a
big
story
it
sure
is
and
we
late
get
a
move
on
brother
jerry
glanced
toward
penny
remembering
that
she
too
had
a
story
to
be
covered
we
go
to
fenestra
place
tomorrow
he
promised
hurriedly
knowing
that
penny
might
try
to
investigate
the
cave
alone
he
hooked
his
arm
through
hers
pulling
her
along
back
you
go
to
camp
he
said
this
is
no
place
for
a
little
girl
at
night
penny
protests
went
unheeded
jerry
and
salt
marched
her
between
them
to
the
cottage
unceremoniously
turning
her
over
to
her
father
they
leaped
into
a
press
car
and
were
gone
hours
later
the
picnic
came
to
an
end
riding
home
with
her
father
after
taking
horney
to
the
building
penny
was
startled
to
observe
a
light
in
an
upstairs
window
of
the
parker
house
why
that
in
weems
room
she
exclaimed
she
ca
be
home
penny
was
mistaken
upon
hastening
upstairs
to
investigate
she
was
met
at
the
bedroom
door
by
the
housekeeper
why
weems
i
thought
you
intended
to
stay
on
the
farm
until
tomorrow
i
decided
a
few
hours
would
make
no
difference
penny
the
place
was
unbearable
how
did
you
get
home
by
taxicab
oh
i
wish
you
had
stayed
one
day
longer
sighed
penny
did
you
learn
anything
since
i
saw
you
last
nothing
of
value
fenestra
came
home
a
short
time
before
i
left
he
was
in
a
dreadful
temper
had
he
been
in
a
fight
penny
asked
quickly
there
was
a
black
and
blue
mark
across
his
cheek
then
i
was
right
exclaimed
penny
triumphantly
i
wish
i
knew
for
certain
who
attacked
him
questioned
by
weems
she
described
the
scene
witnessed
at
the
river
and
proudly
displayed
the
key
why
it
does
resemble
one
i
seen
fenestra
use
declared
the
housekeeper
then
it
must
unlock
the
cave
tomorrow
i
go
there
and
find
out
you
do
no
such
thing
replied
weems
firmly
that
is
not
without
your
father
permission
but
you
know
dad
wo
be
in
favor
of
it
groaned
penny
i
simply
must
go
there
and
get
a
scoop
for
the
no
penny
you
need
to
be
protected
from
your
own
recklessness
your
father
must
be
consulted
before
you
visit
the
farm
again
either
he
say
i
ca
go
or
if
he
thinks
there
anything
to
the
story
he
turn
it
over
to
a
reporter
whichever
he
does
i
lose
penny
i
am
in
no
mood
to
listen
to
your
pleadings
weems
said
wearily
if
you
excuse
me
i
go
to
bed
grumbling
at
the
decision
penny
went
to
her
own
room
she
did
not
feel
equal
to
a
spirited
discussion
with
her
father
that
night
here
i
on
the
verge
of
solving
a
great
mystery
she
grieved
perhaps
the
most
stupendous
of
my
life
and
now
i
told
i
must
stay
away
from
fenestra
farm
it
enough
to
turn
my
hair
gray
penny
overslept
the
next
morning
barely
awakening
in
time
to
reach
school
by
nine
a
surprise
oral
history
quiz
caught
her
completely
unprepared
she
missed
three
questions
in
succession
and
was
told
that
she
must
remain
after
school
for
a
special
study
session
released
at
penny
hastened
to
the
office
neither
her
father
nor
jerry
were
there
nor
could
anyone
tell
her
when
they
would
return
discouraged
she
sought
louise
who
as
usual
was
working
at
the
plant
such
luck
as
i
am
having
penny
complained
weems
says
i
ca
go
to
fenestra
farm
without
dad
permission
and
he
hiding
from
me
i
wish
you
would
forget
that
storm
cave
and
the
octopus
tattoo
said
louise
unsympathetically
maybe
then
we
could
get
out
another
issue
of
this
old
paper
penny
gazed
at
her
rather
queerly
you
sick
of
it
are
you
she
asked
no
louise
denied
it
been
fun
and
we
learned
a
lot
but
so
much
work
it
never
ends
it
will
soon
replied
penny
quietly
our
advertisers
are
dropping
off
one
by
one
sales
are
falling
too
we
always
can
quit
said
louise
cheerfully
no
we
ca
penny
mouth
drew
into
a
tight
line
fred
clousky
would
taunt
me
to
my
dying
day
i
never
close
the
plant
except
in
a
blaze
of
journalistic
glory
but
you
just
said
we
failing
what
the
needs
and
must
have
is
a
tremendous
story
somehow
going
to
get
it
you
nothing
if
not
persistent
said
louise
admiringly
oh
before
i
forget
it
old
horney
has
been
up
here
several
times
inquiring
for
you
more
bad
news
i
suppose
he
did
say
why
he
wished
to
talk
with
you
i
thought
he
seemed
rather
disturbed
though
i
see
what
he
wants
penny
sought
horney
in
the
composing
department
and
pressroom
and
even
ventured
into
the
basement
the
old
man
was
not
to
be
found
concluding
that
he
had
left
the
building
she
gave
up
the
search
she
helped
louise
read
proof
until
six
and
then
telephoned
home
to
inquire
if
her
father
were
there
learning
from
weems
that
he
did
not
expect
to
come
until
later
she
decided
to
remain
downtown
for
her
own
dinner
why
do
you
stay
with
me
lou
she
invited
afterwards
i
take
you
on
a
little
adventure
not
to
fenestra
her
chum
demanded
suspiciously
unfortunately
no
i
shall
do
a
bit
of
spade
work
by
watching
ellis
saal
shop
this
is
thursday
you
know
it
will
be
a
long
tedious
wait
i
consider
it
well
worth
the
time
if
i
learn
the
identity
of
customer
you
do
care
to
come
on
the
contrary
i
do
i
telephone
mother
the
girls
dined
at
a
café
not
far
from
the
and
soon
thereafter
stationed
themselves
a
half
block
from
ellis
saal
shop
an
hour
elapsed
several
times
they
became
hopeful
as
persons
paused
to
gaze
at
the
exhibits
in
the
show
window
but
no
one
entered
a
cold
wind
made
their
vigil
increasingly
uncomfortable
if
we
do
get
action
in
another
fifteen
minutes
i
am
going
home
chattered
louise
a
clock
struck
five
minutes
later
penny
observed
a
familiar
figure
coming
briskly
down
the
street
she
touched
her
chum
arm
it
peter
fenestra
louise
murmured
you
do
think
he
the
one
we
soon
see
fenestra
was
too
far
away
to
notice
the
girls
as
they
watched
he
walked
to
the
doorway
of
ellis
saal
shop
quickly
he
glanced
about
as
if
to
ascertain
that
the
street
was
deserted
then
he
slipped
into
the
shop
closing
the
door
behind
him
chapter
of
the
peter
fenestra
murmured
louise
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
he
is
the
customer
ellis
saal
meant
not
in
my
opinion
rejoined
penny
is
it
possible
that
he
went
into
the
shop
to
have
a
photograph
taken
or
for
some
other
reason
possible
but
not
probable
no
lou
we
should
have
guessed
long
ago
that
fenestra
is
an
it
all
becoming
clear
now
then
i
wish
you
would
explain
to
me
do
you
see
anchor
joe
john
munn
fenestra
and
perhaps
a
fourth
man
must
have
been
good
friends
at
one
time
they
had
their
tattoos
with
that
phrase
for
one
one
for
pricked
on
their
backs
then
fenestra
must
have
done
something
which
made
the
others
angry
they
followed
him
here
to
get
even
with
him
what
makes
you
think
that
louise
asked
dubiously
anchor
joe
gave
us
a
good
broad
hint
then
we
know
that
he
and
at
least
one
other
man
have
kept
watch
of
the
fenestra
farm
what
can
the
man
have
done
to
offend
them
i
ca
guess
that
part
admitted
penny
another
thing
why
should
fenestra
decide
to
have
his
octopus
tattoo
removed
and
who
pushed
john
munn
off
the
bridge
louise
added
we
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
not
quite
amended
penny
i
feel
that
if
only
we
could
get
into
that
storm
cave
we
might
learn
the
answer
to
some
of
our
questions
you
not
thinking
of
investigating
it
tonight
penny
shook
her
head
i
ca
without
dad
permission
it
a
pity
too
because
i
know
a
big
story
is
awaiting
me
if
only
i
could
go
out
there
and
get
it
i
sure
of
one
thing
we
never
dare
print
a
word
against
fenestra
without
absolute
proof
no
agreed
penny
her
eyebrows
knitting
in
a
frown
it
would
lead
to
legal
trouble
deciding
that
nothing
more
could
be
learned
by
waiting
the
girls
returned
to
the
parked
car
motoring
toward
louise
home
they
discussed
various
angles
of
the
baffling
case
confronting
them
always
was
the
fact
that
peter
fenestra
reputation
in
riverview
was
excellent
while
anchor
joe
and
john
munn
appeared
to
be
persons
of
questionable
character
you
never
learned
why
joe
was
wanted
by
the
authorities
louise
inquired
alighting
at
her
doorstep
no
i
have
seen
moyer
since
that
day
at
the
cottage
reasonably
sure
joe
is
still
at
liberty
he
may
be
the
one
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
trouble
declared
louise
we
tend
to
suspect
fenestra
of
evil
doing
because
we
dislike
him
so
heartily
that
so
lou
the
best
way
is
to
have
no
opinions
and
wait
for
facts
but
waiting
wears
me
to
a
frazzle
after
parting
from
her
chum
penny
did
not
drive
home
instead
she
turned
into
drexel
boulevard
and
presently
was
ringing
the
doorbell
of
the
judson
home
the
door
was
opened
by
matthew
judson
penny
had
not
expected
to
meet
the
former
publisher
somewhat
confusedly
she
inquired
for
pauletta
my
daughter
is
here
now
replied
judson
i
expect
her
home
within
a
few
minutes
wo
you
wait
no
thank
you
penny
declined
i
drop
in
some
other
time
i
wish
you
would
stay
urged
judson
i
find
an
empty
house
so
depressing
penny
hesitated
and
then
followed
the
former
publisher
to
the
living
room
judson
had
been
reading
the
newspaper
he
swept
it
from
a
chair
so
that
the
girl
could
sit
opposite
him
tell
me
how
you
are
getting
on
with
your
newspaper
he
urged
in
a
friendly
tone
penny
talked
entertainingly
relating
the
various
difficulties
which
beset
a
young
publisher
i
even
received
threatening
notes
she
revealed
or
rather
one
i
think
it
was
left
on
my
desk
by
a
man
named
peter
fenestra
fenestra
judson
face
darkened
yes
answered
penny
watching
the
publisher
attentively
do
you
know
him
only
by
reputation
he
a
scoundrel
his
voice
grew
quite
intense
can
you
tell
me
anything
definite
against
him
no
no
i
ca
i
only
advise
you
to
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
him
the
telephone
rang
and
judson
arose
to
answer
it
during
his
absence
penny
thought
swiftly
dared
she
mention
the
clipping
which
she
had
found
in
the
publisher
desk
she
did
not
wish
to
antagonize
him
yet
there
were
many
questions
she
longed
to
ask
judson
presently
returned
penny
decided
to
risk
his
anger
casually
she
introduced
the
subject
by
mentioning
that
she
was
using
judson
former
office
and
desk
as
her
own
yesterday
i
came
upon
a
clipping
caught
beneath
the
lower
drawer
she
said
quietly
it
concerned
a
man
named
matthew
jewel
he
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
you
the
publisher
raised
his
eyes
to
stare
intently
at
penny
his
hands
gripped
the
chair
arms
so
hard
that
the
knuckles
became
a
splotches
of
red
appeared
on
his
forehead
matthew
jewel
he
murmured
at
last
yes
judson
but
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
i
shall
not
expose
you
then
you
know
the
likeness
was
unmistakable
i
read
the
clipping
too
the
publisher
arose
nervously
walking
to
the
fireplace
his
hands
trembled
as
he
fingered
an
ornament
on
the
shelf
i
searched
everywhere
for
that
clipping
when
i
cleaned
out
my
desk
he
mumbled
i
gone
through
every
imaginable
torture
fearing
it
would
be
found
and
now
i
am
to
be
exposed
but
i
assure
you
i
have
no
intention
of
telling
anyone
said
penny
earnestly
your
past
is
your
own
a
man
past
never
is
his
own
responded
judson
bitterly
i
should
have
mentioned
it
i
hoped
i
might
be
able
to
help
you
you
have
told
pauletta
no
nor
any
other
person
judson
tenseness
relaxed
slightly
he
paced
across
the
room
and
back
then
faced
penny
all
my
life
he
said
very
quietly
i
have
tried
to
spare
pauletta
the
knowledge
that
her
father
was
a
convict
i
have
much
to
offer
but
i
give
anything
within
reason
to
keep
the
story
out
of
the
paper
you
do
understand
interrupted
penny
i
have
no
intention
of
printing
the
information
or
of
telling
anyone
i
want
nothing
from
you
but
i
do
wish
you
would
tell
me
the
true
story
i
am
sure
there
were
extenuating
circumstances
judson
sagged
into
an
armchair
none
he
said
none
whatsoever
i
used
money
which
did
not
belong
to
me
my
wife
was
desperately
sick
at
the
time
and
i
wanted
her
to
have
the
care
of
specialists
she
died
while
i
was
serving
my
sentence
why
you
did
have
a
reason
for
taking
the
money
said
penny
kindly
you
should
have
been
granted
a
pardon
a
theft
is
a
theft
when
i
left
prison
i
made
a
new
start
here
and
devoted
myself
to
pauletta
who
was
then
a
little
girl
how
old
was
she
inquired
penny
judson
gave
no
indication
that
he
heard
the
question
he
resumed
the
truth
had
been
kept
from
pauletta
she
believes
that
i
was
abroad
during
those
years
i
spent
in
prison
here
in
riverview
i
prospered
people
were
kind
to
me
i
made
money
and
made
it
honestly
the
future
was
very
bright
until
a
year
ago
then
you
gave
up
your
newspaper
commented
penny
why
ca
you
guess
blackmail
judson
nodded
one
day
a
man
came
to
me
a
man
i
had
known
in
prison
he
threatened
to
expose
me
unless
i
paid
him
a
large
sum
of
money
and
you
agreed
i
did
was
that
rather
foolish
people
would
have
been
charitable
if
you
had
admitted
the
truth
i
considered
it
from
every
angle
particularly
from
standpoint
i
gave
the
man
what
he
asked
although
it
cost
me
the
but
that
was
not
the
end
he
still
bothers
you
yes
i
pay
as
long
as
i
have
a
penny
i
thought
of
taking
pauletta
and
going
away
but
he
would
trace
me
who
is
the
man
mr
judson
i
ca
tell
you
is
it
either
anchor
joe
landa
or
peter
fenestra
judson
face
did
not
alter
i
ca
tell
you
he
repeated
i
wish
you
would
talk
to
dad
penny
said
after
a
moment
he
might
be
able
to
help
you
no
returned
judson
growing
agitated
again
you
gave
your
promise
that
you
would
not
tell
of
course
i
keep
it
responded
penny
it
does
seem
to
me
though
that
the
easiest
thing
would
be
to
admit
the
truth
and
be
rid
of
the
man
who
robs
you
pauletta
would
understand
judson
shook
his
head
i
have
made
my
decision
he
said
as
long
as
i
can
i
shall
abide
by
it
there
was
nothing
penny
could
do
but
bid
judson
good
evening
and
leave
the
house
his
secret
troubled
her
if
he
had
told
her
the
entire
truth
it
seemed
very
foolish
of
him
to
meet
the
demands
of
a
blackmailer
i
wonder
if
judson
did
tell
me
everything
she
mused
i
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
keeping
something
back
the
car
rolled
into
the
driveway
of
the
parker
home
as
penny
jumped
out
to
open
the
garage
doors
a
man
who
had
been
sitting
on
the
back
doorstep
arose
his
face
was
hidden
but
she
knew
it
was
not
her
father
who
is
it
she
called
uneasily
the
voice
was
reassuring
it
horney
miss
penny
i
been
waitin
for
you
what
brings
you
here
she
asked
hurrying
to
meet
him
i
hope
nothing
bad
has
happened
at
the
everything
fine
there
i
got
a
letter
i
thought
you
would
want
to
see
right
away
found
it
tonight
when
i
was
sweeping
up
it
answers
a
lot
of
questions
you
been
askin
penny
took
the
paper
from
old
horney
gnarled
hand
not
about
matthew
judson
she
asked
read
it
and
you
see
encouraged
the
pressman
judson
was
blackmailed
just
as
i
always
thought
and
by
the
man
who
signed
this
letter
chapter
it
was
too
dark
for
penny
to
read
the
letter
stepping
to
the
car
she
switched
on
the
headlights
and
held
the
paper
in
its
brilliant
beam
the
letter
read
dear
matthew
sorry
to
bother
you
again
old
pal
but
i
know
you
always
willing
to
give
an
old
buddy
and
cellmate
a
helping
hand
i
do
want
to
tip
off
the
new
york
cops
where
you
are
and
you
can
trust
me
to
keep
mum
if
you
come
through
with
another
six
thousand
this
is
my
last
request
peter
peter
fenestra
exclaimed
penny
and
it
no
surprise
either
horney
where
did
you
find
this
letter
it
was
in
a
pile
of
rubbish
down
in
the
basement
i
do
know
how
it
got
there
peter
fenestra
has
a
habit
of
leaving
notes
on
judson
desk
declared
penny
this
one
may
have
blown
off
and
been
swept
out
without
the
publisher
seeing
it
do
you
figure
it
a
blackmail
attempt
of
course
it
is
horney
you
not
shown
the
letter
to
anyone
only
to
you
from
the
threat
i
dope
it
out
that
judson
was
sent
to
prison
years
ago
and
he
still
wanted
penny
nodded
as
she
placed
the
letter
in
her
pocketbook
his
guess
was
a
shrewd
one
but
she
could
tell
him
nothing
without
breaking
her
promise
to
judson
horney
she
said
a
great
deal
hinges
upon
this
letter
you
not
tell
anyone
what
you
learned
oh
i
keep
it
to
myself
i
not
one
to
get
judson
into
trouble
had
enough
of
it
already
penny
noticed
that
her
father
car
was
not
in
the
garage
she
reasoned
that
since
he
had
not
come
home
he
must
be
working
late
at
the
office
as
he
frequently
did
jump
in
horney
she
invited
swinging
wide
the
car
door
i
going
downtown
to
find
dad
i
give
you
a
ride
she
was
grateful
that
the
pressman
had
little
to
say
as
they
sped
through
dimly
lighted
residential
streets
how
much
he
suspected
she
could
only
guess
but
the
letter
had
made
it
clear
to
her
that
the
former
publisher
never
had
completed
his
prison
sentence
that
was
why
he
did
answer
me
when
i
asked
about
pauletta
age
she
thought
he
must
have
escaped
from
prison
soon
after
he
was
sent
there
no
longer
did
penny
wonder
why
judson
had
not
refused
peter
fenestra
repeated
demands
for
money
obviously
he
had
feared
a
far
worse
fate
than
exposure
return
to
the
new
york
state
prison
the
car
turned
into
the
deserted
loading
dock
few
lights
were
visible
in
the
building
for
the
day
staff
had
gone
home
and
only
the
scrub
women
were
at
work
penny
could
not
see
the
windows
of
her
office
from
the
street
nor
did
she
observe
a
man
who
slouched
against
a
wall
not
far
from
where
the
car
had
stopped
old
horney
stepped
from
the
running
board
thanking
penny
for
the
ride
guess
i
amble
up
the
street
and
get
a
cup
of
coffee
you
be
sure
not
to
mention
the
letter
penny
reminded
him
i
wo
tell
a
soul
you
know
i
was
thinkin
about
it
as
we
rode
downtown
peter
fenestra
came
into
the
office
a
couple
of
times
just
before
judson
closed
the
plant
he
was
a
dirty
blackmailer
all
right
would
that
letter
i
gave
you
be
enough
to
send
him
up
i
should
think
so
horney
but
the
problem
is
how
to
take
care
of
him
without
ruining
mr
judson
better
show
the
letter
to
your
father
advised
the
pressman
maybe
he
have
some
ideas
tipping
his
hat
old
horney
moved
briskly
away
penny
entered
the
rear
vestibule
speaking
to
three
scrub
women
who
were
locking
up
their
cleaning
equipment
before
leaving
the
building
not
even
the
elevator
man
was
on
duty
so
she
climbed
the
stairs
switching
on
a
light
in
the
newsroom
she
passed
through
it
to
her
father
office
the
room
was
dark
not
here
thought
penny
i
was
afraid
of
it
deciding
to
telephone
home
she
entered
one
of
the
glass
enclosed
booths
at
the
end
of
the
newsroom
as
she
lifted
the
receiver
a
voice
from
behind
her
said
distinctly
put
that
down
startled
penny
whirled
around
peter
fenestra
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
booth
come
out
of
there
he
ordered
harshly
penny
obeyed
with
alacrity
as
she
tried
to
gather
her
wits
the
building
was
practically
deserted
and
fenestra
took
care
to
stand
between
her
and
the
outside
door
what
do
you
want
here
she
demanded
coldly
the
letter
penny
stared
at
him
blankly
her
astonishment
was
genuine
do
pretend
you
do
know
fenestra
said
harshly
i
want
the
letter
you
and
that
old
man
were
talking
about
oh
light
broke
upon
penny
so
you
heard
our
conversation
you
were
listening
i
happened
to
be
standing
in
the
loading
dock
i
know
you
have
the
letter
hand
it
over
penny
backed
a
few
steps
away
toward
her
father
office
so
you
admit
you
wrote
it
she
challenged
i
admit
nothing
but
i
want
that
letter
you
not
get
it
penny
defied
him
peter
fenestra
you
were
the
one
who
put
that
warning
note
on
my
desk
a
few
days
ago
and
i
know
why
too
you
were
afraid
i
learn
too
much
about
the
octopus
tattoo
well
learned
plenty
fenestra
face
became
contorted
with
rage
he
choked
you
been
down
in
the
cave
and
started
toward
penny
thoroughly
frightened
she
eluded
his
grasp
running
into
her
office
she
slammed
the
door
bracing
her
body
against
it
she
managed
to
turn
the
key
before
fenestra
could
force
it
open
come
out
of
there
he
shouted
furiously
come
out
i
say
and
i
say
i
wo
retorted
penny
just
try
to
get
in
she
pushed
her
father
heavy
desk
across
the
room
placing
it
in
front
of
the
door
fenestra
rattled
the
handle
several
times
and
threw
his
body
against
the
panel
once
or
twice
then
she
heard
footsteps
as
he
walked
away
that
only
a
trick
to
get
me
to
come
out
thought
penny
i
wo
be
stupid
enough
to
fall
into
his
trap
i
stay
right
here
walking
to
the
window
she
gazed
down
cars
were
passing
along
the
street
if
she
shouted
for
help
someone
might
hear
her
however
to
explain
her
predicament
would
be
rather
awkward
penny
gaze
fell
upon
the
telephone
which
had
fallen
from
the
desk
to
the
floor
picking
it
up
she
dialed
the
number
of
her
own
house
weems
answered
hello
said
penny
cheerfully
dad
has
come
home
yet
by
any
chance
he
just
now
driving
into
the
garage
the
housekeeper
replied
call
him
a
moment
later
penny
heard
her
father
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
dad
she
said
i
down
at
your
office
sitting
behind
some
barbed
wire
entanglements
i
wish
you
get
a
policeman
and
see
what
you
can
do
about
rescuing
me
is
this
one
of
your
jokes
parker
demanded
fearful
that
her
father
would
hang
up
the
receiver
penny
talked
fast
and
to
the
point
parker
assured
her
he
would
come
without
a
delay
i
guess
that
will
teach
peter
fenestra
not
to
get
funny
with
me
she
congratulated
herself
it
pays
to
do
a
little
thinking
fenestra
will
be
arrested
and
then
i
drive
out
and
learn
what
he
hides
in
his
cave
penny
sniffed
the
air
she
could
smell
smoke
and
she
thought
it
must
be
coming
from
a
cigarette
evidently
fenestra
had
stolen
to
the
door
and
was
patiently
waiting
for
her
to
emerge
he
have
a
long
wait
she
chuckled
gradually
her
elation
died
the
odor
of
smoke
had
grown
stronger
she
saw
a
wisp
of
it
filter
beneath
the
door
crack
penny
heart
caught
in
her
throat
tensely
she
listened
was
it
imagination
or
could
she
hear
the
crackle
of
flames
fenestra
may
be
burning
the
papers
of
a
scrap
basket
just
to
smoke
me
out
she
thought
probably
that
just
what
he
doing
pulling
the
heavy
desk
away
from
the
door
she
stood
with
her
ear
against
the
panel
distinctly
she
could
hear
the
crackle
of
flames
the
wood
felt
warm
to
her
cheek
suddenly
penny
was
afraid
frantically
she
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
the
door
swung
outward
to
the
pressure
of
her
shoulder
a
wave
of
heat
rushed
in
penny
staggered
backward
horrified
by
the
sight
which
met
her
eyes
at
the
end
of
the
newsroom
where
the
exit
should
have
been
rose
a
towering
barrier
of
flames
chapter
barrier
of
escape
through
the
newsroom
was
cut
off
panic
seized
penny
but
only
for
an
instant
retreating
she
telephoned
the
fire
department
then
finding
a
chemical
extinguisher
she
began
fighting
the
flames
black
rolling
smoke
billowed
into
her
face
choking
and
blinding
her
the
heat
drove
her
back
from
far
down
the
street
came
the
wail
of
a
siren
penny
rushed
to
a
window
a
pumper
and
a
truck
swung
around
the
corner
lurching
to
a
stop
raising
the
sash
she
stepped
out
onto
the
ledge
waving
to
the
men
below
stay
where
you
are
shouted
a
fireman
we
get
you
a
ladder
shot
up
but
penny
did
not
wait
to
be
carried
to
safety
before
a
fireman
could
mount
she
scrambled
down
with
the
agility
of
a
monkey
the
fire
started
in
the
newsroom
she
gasped
but
it
already
spread
into
the
composing
department
anyone
else
in
the
building
i
do
think
so
there
were
three
scrub
women
but
they
probably
out
now
lines
of
hose
were
stretched
to
the
hydrants
and
streams
of
water
began
to
play
on
the
flames
a
crowd
following
in
the
wake
of
the
fire
engines
was
ordered
back
by
the
police
one
young
man
broke
through
darting
to
penny
side
jerry
she
exclaimed
gosh
how
did
it
start
he
demanded
why
penny
your
hair
is
singed
i
was
in
it
she
said
briefly
i
ca
explain
now
but
the
fire
was
started
by
peter
fenestra
on
purpose
i
do
know
about
that
he
was
smoking
a
cigarette
have
you
told
the
police
not
yet
i
waiting
for
dad
a
car
inched
through
the
crowd
stopping
a
few
yards
away
parker
leaped
out
and
ran
toward
the
burning
building
he
was
stopped
at
the
entrance
by
a
fireman
let
me
in
there
the
publisher
shouted
trying
to
free
himself
my
daughter
inside
no
here
i
am
dad
penny
cried
grasping
his
hand
parker
said
no
word
but
he
pulled
her
to
him
in
a
rough
embrace
the
next
moment
he
was
trying
once
more
to
enter
the
building
intending
to
save
important
papers
take
it
easy
parker
advised
the
fireman
barring
the
door
with
his
hose
the
smoke
bad
in
there
will
the
building
go
we
save
most
of
it
the
fireman
assured
him
confidently
penny
plucked
at
her
father
sleeve
dad
ought
the
police
be
sent
after
peter
fenestra
he
responsible
for
this
and
a
lot
of
other
things
too
you
mean
fenestra
set
the
fire
above
the
roar
of
flames
penny
tersely
disclosed
how
the
man
had
compelled
her
to
take
refuge
in
the
inner
office
room
jerry
also
heard
the
story
and
when
she
had
finished
he
said
to
parker
chief
let
me
take
a
couple
of
policemen
and
nail
that
fellow
maybe
we
can
arrest
him
at
the
farm
before
he
makes
a
go
ahead
urged
parker
i
going
along
declared
penny
and
darted
away
before
her
father
could
stop
her
twenty
minutes
later
with
a
police
cruiser
dispatched
to
place
she
and
jerry
drove
there
in
parker
car
parking
some
distance
down
the
road
they
walked
cautiously
toward
the
farmhouse
which
loomed
dark
against
the
sky
no
lights
burned
in
the
windows
the
grounds
appeared
deserted
looks
as
if
fenestra
is
here
observed
jerry
no
use
waiting
for
the
police
boldly
going
to
the
front
door
he
pounded
on
it
ordering
in
a
loud
voice
open
up
he
not
here
said
penny
after
a
moment
unless
perhaps
he
hiding
the
place
looks
deserted
to
me
penny
glanced
toward
the
storm
cave
remembering
that
she
had
the
key
to
the
padlock
in
her
pocket
jerry
read
her
thought
and
followed
as
she
went
quickly
toward
the
mound
it
locked
he
said
indicating
the
padlock
here
the
key
eagerly
penny
offered
it
to
jerry
i
sure
this
must
be
the
one
the
reporter
gave
her
a
flashlight
to
hold
while
he
tried
to
fit
the
key
into
the
lock
it
no
go
penny
but
i
was
so
sure
jerry
she
stooped
to
examine
the
padlock
well
no
wonder
it
been
changed
then
we
out
of
luck
until
the
police
get
here
is
there
any
way
we
can
open
it
ourselves
maybe
i
can
break
it
there
should
be
tools
in
the
barn
jerry
i
see
what
i
can
find
leaving
penny
the
reporter
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
barn
extinguishing
the
flashlight
she
patiently
waited
suddenly
she
was
startled
to
hear
running
footsteps
barely
had
she
crouched
behind
the
storm
cave
before
a
man
emerged
from
among
the
pine
trees
adjoining
the
road
it
was
peter
fenestra
and
he
was
breathing
hard
straight
toward
the
cave
he
ran
pausing
at
the
slanting
door
he
peered
quickly
about
and
then
fumbled
with
the
padlock
in
desperate
haste
he
jerked
it
loose
swung
back
the
hinged
door
and
descended
the
stone
steps
penny
waited
a
moment
then
crept
to
the
entrance
fenestra
had
not
taken
time
to
lower
the
door
behind
him
a
light
shone
from
an
underground
room
at
one
side
of
the
main
passageway
and
she
could
hear
the
man
heavy
boots
scuffing
on
a
cement
floor
penny
considered
going
after
jerry
and
decided
against
it
frantic
haste
suggested
that
he
might
not
linger
long
in
the
cave
what
could
he
be
doing
beneath
ground
with
jerry
so
near
she
felt
that
it
would
not
be
too
dangerous
to
investigate
warily
she
tiptoed
down
the
steps
a
low
rounding
doorway
opened
from
the
descending
passage
peering
into
the
dimly
lighted
room
penny
did
not
immediately
see
peter
fenestra
instead
her
gaze
roved
about
the
walls
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
workshop
tools
were
neatly
arranged
over
a
bench
while
a
cupboard
of
shelves
contained
miscellaneous
mechanical
parts
at
the
far
end
of
the
cave
stood
an
contrivance
which
the
girl
took
to
be
an
electric
furnace
an
armored
cable
ran
from
it
to
a
heavy
wall
switch
having
two
blades
and
a
sizable
wooden
handle
plainly
it
was
designed
to
carry
a
very
heavy
current
peter
fenestra
came
from
behind
the
furnace
penny
saw
him
throw
the
switch
almost
immediately
she
heard
a
low
hissing
sound
from
the
interior
of
the
metal
oven
slowly
the
furnace
heated
and
soon
glowed
weirdly
as
she
pondered
what
the
man
could
be
intending
to
do
she
heard
a
slight
sound
at
the
stairway
entrance
thinking
that
jerry
had
returned
she
started
up
the
steps
not
one
figure
but
three
loomed
in
the
doorway
penny
flattened
herself
against
the
dirt
wall
but
she
could
not
avoid
being
seen
a
flashlight
beam
focused
upon
her
and
the
next
instant
a
revolver
muzzle
bit
into
her
side
keep
quiet
she
was
ordered
in
a
whisper
you
wo
be
hurt
penny
stared
into
the
grim
face
of
anchor
joe
behind
him
came
john
munn
and
a
man
she
had
never
seen
before
in
a
flash
she
knew
why
they
were
there
to
avenge
themselves
upon
peter
fenestra
quietly
as
the
men
had
moved
they
had
been
heard
in
the
next
room
who
there
fenestra
called
sharply
john
munn
and
anchor
joe
stepped
into
the
rectangle
of
light
their
revolvers
trained
upon
the
man
just
three
of
your
old
pals
otto
drawled
anchor
joe
reach
listen
joe
you
got
me
all
wrong
peter
fenestra
whined
i
can
explain
why
i
kept
the
gold
i
give
it
all
to
you
if
that
what
you
want
i
do
anything
do
shoot
shootin
would
be
too
good
for
you
retorted
anchor
joe
we
got
other
plans
his
face
was
dark
with
rage
sure
we
know
how
to
deal
with
a
traitor
added
john
munn
deftly
whisking
a
revolver
from
fenestra
hip
pocket
you
thought
you
could
hide
from
us
you
thought
by
changing
your
name
and
coming
to
this
town
you
could
fool
us
why
you
dirty
rat
you
even
thought
you
could
get
by
with
pushing
me
off
a
bridge
your
greed
kept
you
here
taunted
anchor
joe
you
could
bear
to
leave
any
of
those
gold
bars
behind
you
thought
you
melt
down
the
last
of
tonight
and
skip
added
john
munn
you
goin
on
a
long
trip
all
right
but
with
us
a
pair
of
steel
cuffs
were
slipped
over
fenestra
wrists
speedily
the
sailors
searched
the
cave
gathering
up
several
bags
of
what
penny
assumed
to
be
gold
how
about
this
bar
john
munn
asked
his
companions
can
we
handle
it
too
heavy
answered
anchor
joe
with
moyer
hot
on
our
trail
we
got
to
travel
light
get
going
and
i
follow
munn
and
his
companion
marched
peter
fenestra
from
the
cave
taking
a
cord
from
his
pocket
anchor
joe
bound
penny
hands
and
feet
i
tying
loose
he
said
and
i
leave
the
cave
door
open
after
we
gone
you
can
yell
for
help
joe
where
are
you
taking
fenestra
what
has
he
done
the
sailor
did
not
answer
seizing
a
bag
of
gold
he
slung
it
over
his
shoulder
and
went
quickly
up
the
stairs
penny
was
left
in
the
darkness
chapter
minutes
later
jerry
returning
from
the
barn
heard
penny
muffled
scream
for
help
descending
into
the
cave
he
immediately
freed
her
and
learned
what
had
happened
fenestra
used
this
furnace
for
melting
down
gold
all
right
he
exclaimed
peering
into
the
dark
cavern
wonder
where
he
got
it
it
must
be
stolen
gold
government
gold
perhaps
gasped
penny
jerry
those
men
have
been
gone
only
a
minute
or
two
then
maybe
we
can
get
yet
jerry
had
heard
an
automobile
turn
into
the
yard
hopeful
that
it
might
be
the
awaited
authorities
he
and
penny
ran
up
the
stone
steps
to
their
joy
they
saw
that
it
was
the
police
cruiser
in
terse
sentences
they
told
their
story
to
the
officers
penny
had
no
idea
which
direction
the
men
had
gone
but
the
reporter
recalled
having
seen
a
group
of
four
walking
toward
the
river
just
as
he
had
left
the
barn
with
jerry
and
penny
standing
on
the
running
board
the
police
car
headed
in
the
direction
of
the
big
bear
suddenly
a
series
of
explosive
sounds
were
heard
staccato
noises
similar
to
the
of
an
automobile
exhaust
shots
exclaimed
jerry
from
the
river
too
the
car
drew
to
a
halt
the
policemen
leaped
out
and
started
across
the
fields
disregarding
orders
to
remain
behind
penny
and
jerry
followed
breathlessly
they
reached
the
rim
of
the
river
a
beam
of
light
directed
their
gaze
to
the
opposite
shore
a
motor
boat
had
pulled
away
and
was
fast
gathering
speed
flashes
of
gunfire
from
its
decks
were
answered
by
the
revolvers
of
men
on
the
river
bank
shielding
penny
with
his
body
jerry
drew
her
behind
a
tree
in
a
moment
as
the
motor
boat
passed
beyond
range
firing
ceased
then
they
slid
down
the
bank
to
learn
what
had
occurred
penny
saw
that
peter
fenestra
had
been
captured
he
was
handcuffed
to
moyer
and
she
instantly
guessed
that
the
other
four
men
were
government
operatives
find
a
boat
and
start
after
those
three
sailors
who
got
away
moyer
ordered
his
men
tersely
i
take
this
fellow
to
town
penny
edged
forward
obtaining
an
excellent
view
of
peter
downcast
face
quietly
she
made
her
accusations
telling
of
the
cave
where
she
had
been
imprisoned
so
that
was
how
the
gold
was
melted
down
commented
moyer
he
then
explained
that
for
days
his
operatives
had
watched
the
river
where
they
knew
anchor
joe
had
hidden
a
motorboat
surprised
in
the
act
of
taking
off
the
sailors
had
exchanged
shots
with
the
government
men
but
by
abandoning
fenestra
and
the
gold
they
had
escaped
this
man
real
name
is
otto
franey
moyer
revealed
indicating
fenestra
he
and
the
three
sailors
were
shipmates
aboard
the
they
wanted
for
stealing
gold
questioned
penny
yes
they
got
away
with
four
gold
bars
taken
from
the
you
see
about
a
year
ago
a
consignment
of
gold
was
shipped
by
a
swiss
bank
to
the
new
york
federal
reserve
because
of
heavy
fog
the
bars
were
unloaded
at
the
pier
instead
of
being
taken
off
at
quarantine
they
were
removed
in
a
sling
and
dumped
on
the
wharf
to
await
the
mail
truck
and
the
four
sailors
saw
a
chance
to
steal
some
of
the
bars
questioned
jerry
yes
how
they
accomplished
it
we
do
know
but
hours
later
a
mail
driver
refused
to
sign
for
one
of
the
bags
because
it
had
been
slit
open
four
bars
valued
at
approximately
fourteen
thousand
dollars
each
were
missing
investigation
disclosed
that
a
sailor
otto
franey
had
jumped
ship
a
few
days
later
joe
landa
john
munn
and
jack
guenther
also
disappeared
each
man
was
marked
with
an
octopus
tattoo
was
he
penny
inquired
eagerly
yes
although
i
did
not
learn
that
until
a
day
or
so
ago
otto
has
been
trying
to
get
his
tattoo
removed
so
that
it
would
be
harder
to
trace
him
the
four
sailors
had
their
backs
marked
with
an
octopus
design
and
words
which
read
for
one
one
for
when
put
together
they
were
feeling
very
friendly
toward
each
other
at
that
time
then
i
was
right
exclaimed
penny
and
the
four
conspired
to
steal
the
gold
bars
otto
was
entrusted
by
his
pals
to
dispose
of
the
stolen
gold
instead
he
gave
them
the
slip
and
tried
to
keep
it
for
himself
evidently
he
rigged
up
a
furnace
and
melted
the
metal
into
useable
form
but
the
three
sailors
trailed
him
here
determined
to
avenge
themselves
as
fenestra
was
hustled
to
a
waiting
car
penny
told
moyer
everything
she
knew
about
the
prisoner
save
his
connection
with
matthew
judson
deliberately
she
withheld
information
about
the
blackmail
plot
while
the
prisoner
was
being
loaded
into
the
government
car
another
automobile
drew
up
nearby
recognizing
parker
at
the
wheel
penny
and
jerry
ran
to
tell
him
the
latest
news
full
speed
ahead
chief
exclaimed
the
reporter
sliding
into
the
front
seat
we
got
a
big
story
by
the
tail
a
lot
of
good
it
does
us
responded
the
publisher
gloomily
you
mean
the
firemen
failed
to
save
the
building
penny
asked
anxiously
the
building
saved
but
considerable
damage
was
done
by
fire
and
water
we
ca
use
the
plant
for
several
days
it
enough
to
make
a
man
ill
scooped
by
the
opposition
when
the
story
is
ours
you
forget
the
little
reminded
penny
old
homey
has
everything
ready
to
roll
i
turning
the
plant
over
to
you
to
me
parker
did
not
understand
her
meaning
yes
gather
your
mechanical
force
the
plant
yours
for
the
night
penny
you
the
tops
the
publisher
exclaimed
starting
the
car
with
a
lurch
together
we
get
out
an
extra
that
will
be
an
extra
after
that
penny
lost
all
sense
of
time
as
events
transpired
with
rapidity
and
precision
as
if
by
magic
the
staff
of
the
appeared
to
take
over
the
plant
the
building
shook
off
its
lethargy
and
machinery
began
to
turn
allowing
jerry
to
write
the
big
story
penny
tried
to
be
everywhere
at
once
she
fluttered
at
dewitt
elbow
as
he
drew
a
dummy
of
the
front
page
let
make
it
type
she
urged
splashy
a
double
column
story
with
a
to
page
three
anything
you
say
was
dewitt
surprising
answer
in
the
composing
room
printers
were
locking
the
forms
using
pages
previously
made
ready
for
the
next
issue
of
the
stereotypers
were
testing
the
pneumatic
steam
tables
pressmen
under
old
horney
direction
oiled
the
rotaries
and
tightened
bolts
at
last
came
the
moment
when
the
starter
plate
was
fitted
into
place
on
the
cylinder
with
a
half
turn
of
a
t
wrench
old
horney
made
it
secure
she
ready
he
announced
flashing
the
signal
light
you
push
the
button
penny
trembling
with
excitement
she
started
the
press
rolling
faster
and
faster
it
went
in
a
moment
papers
dropped
so
swiftly
from
the
folder
that
her
eye
could
not
follow
a
conveyer
carried
them
upward
over
the
presses
to
the
distributing
room
parker
offered
penny
a
paper
smiling
as
he
saw
her
stare
at
the
nameplate
instead
of
the
it
read
weekly
why
dad
she
exclaimed
they
made
a
mistake
it
no
mistake
he
corrected
this
is
your
extra
your
name
appears
as
managing
editor
so
that
was
why
dewitt
was
so
agreeable
to
all
my
suggestions
she
laughed
i
might
have
guessed
later
while
newsboys
cried
their
wares
penny
and
her
father
sat
in
the
private
office
talking
with
matthew
judson
from
his
own
lips
they
learned
how
he
had
submitted
to
blackmail
rather
than
disgrace
pauletta
by
returning
to
prison
your
case
is
a
deserving
one
parker
told
him
kindly
i
assure
you
we
never
publish
the
story
and
i
do
everything
in
my
power
to
help
you
obtain
a
pardon
before
leaving
the
office
judson
promised
penny
he
would
tell
his
daughter
the
truth
allowing
her
to
break
her
engagement
to
major
atchley
if
she
chose
we
go
away
somewhere
he
said
california
perhaps
although
never
try
to
publish
a
paper
again
at
least
my
life
will
cease
to
be
a
torment
alone
with
her
father
once
more
penny
had
two
requests
to
make
name
them
he
urged
can
you
get
tillie
fellows
a
job
easily
and
will
you
take
horney
into
your
own
plant
i
be
glad
to
do
it
as
soon
as
the
operates
again
until
remodeling
work
is
completed
i
have
no
plant
yes
you
have
dad
this
building
is
yours
if
you
can
make
arrangements
with
mr
veeley
penny
you
willing
to
give
up
the
willing
she
laughed
i
hilariously
crazy
to
get
rid
of
it
matters
have
reached
a
state
where
either
i
must
abandon
the
paper
or
my
education
i
only
awaited
a
chance
to
end
my
career
in
a
blaze
of
glory
a
blaze
expresses
it
very
mildly
smiled
parker
in
all
modesty
let
us
say
a
conflagration
oh
why
be
modest
grinned
penny
let
come
right
out
and
call
it
a
holocaust
that
the
strongest
word
i
know
the
end
transcriber
notes
replaced
the
list
of
books
in
the
series
by
the
complete
list
as
in
the
final
book
the
cry
at
midnight
silently
corrected
a
handful
of
palpable
typos
conforming
to
later
volumes
standardized
on
dewitt
as
the
name
of
the
city
editor
