chapter
a
new
adventure
a
warm
june
breeze
was
blowing
in
from
lake
superior
it
caught
a
strand
of
penny
allen
s
blonde
hair
and
blew
it
across
her
dark
blue
eyes
penny
was
out
in
the
clearing
behind
the
lodge
hanging
blankets
on
the
line
help
she
called
to
her
brother
philip
who
was
working
nearby
help
i
can
t
see
what
i
m
doing
and
my
arms
are
full
of
philip
his
clear
eyes
sparkling
with
laughter
hurried
to
the
rescue
he
extricated
penny
from
the
mound
of
blankets
she
was
carrying
and
helped
her
hang
them
on
the
line
as
they
worked
together
fighting
the
capricious
breeze
that
threatened
every
minute
to
blow
the
blankets
away
penny
said
excitedly
i
can
t
believe
it
phil
we
re
practically
ready
to
open
the
lodge
for
guests
well
not
quite
philip
said
soberly
he
was
twenty
a
year
older
than
penny
and
usually
wore
a
rather
serious
air
this
was
partly
due
to
his
responsibilities
as
the
head
of
the
allen
family
their
uncle
john
allen
had
died
suddenly
a
year
ago
leaving
the
four
orphans
penny
philip
jimmy
and
marjorie
to
shift
for
themselves
he
had
left
the
lodge
to
philip
and
a
beautiful
yacht
the
to
penny
recently
philip
had
decided
to
turn
his
inheritance
into
a
business
venture
the
lovely
house
situated
in
the
michigan
woods
near
lake
superior
would
make
an
ideal
summer
hotel
ever
since
the
first
of
june
they
had
all
been
busy
helping
to
get
it
ready
for
many
of
their
old
friends
who
planned
to
spend
the
summer
there
don
t
look
so
serious
phil
penny
cried
we
just
about
philip
s
eyes
under
their
straight
dark
eyebrows
were
thoughtful
we
re
not
even
organized
yet
penny
he
said
the
winter
just
seemed
to
go
like
a
quick
smile
dispelled
his
seriousness
i
guess
we
spent
too
much
of
the
holidays
enjoying
the
winter
pooh
penny
said
impulsively
we
were
all
together
and
we
had
fun
we
deserved
orphans
since
marjorie
the
youngest
had
been
a
baby
the
allens
had
hardly
known
one
another
for
they
had
all
gone
to
different
schools
and
summer
camps
but
in
spite
of
that
they
had
managed
to
maintain
a
merry
and
cheerful
household
and
now
they
were
all
bound
and
determined
to
make
a
success
of
their
summer
hotel
we
ve
got
plenty
of
time
to
get
organized
in
penny
argued
she
pushed
her
light
brown
hair
out
of
her
eyes
with
one
hand
and
tucked
the
last
clothespin
in
place
with
the
other
here
come
marjorie
and
jimmy
you
can
organize
us
all
right
hi
jimmy
called
striding
toward
them
he
was
the
darkest
member
of
the
family
contrasting
sharply
with
marjorie
she
was
very
fair
with
light
golden
hair
and
eyes
her
slight
figure
and
small
delicate
hands
gave
her
an
almost
elfin
grace
to
which
was
added
a
delightfully
mischievous
quality
she
looks
delicate
jimmy
often
said
but
the
kid
s
as
tough
as
jimmy
s
current
aim
in
life
was
to
reach
at
least
six
feet
before
he
stopped
growing
almost
daily
the
slender
boy
insisted
that
philip
stand
back
to
back
with
him
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
had
finally
become
the
tallest
member
of
the
family
judging
by
the
quantities
of
food
he
packed
away
penny
felt
sure
that
he
would
never
stop
growing
moreover
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
quite
tall
enough
now
what
he
needed
to
do
was
to
gain
a
little
weight
a
summer
here
spent
mostly
outdoors
she
said
to
philip
will
do
both
marjorie
and
jimmy
a
world
of
good
i
hope
they
each
gain
a
few
pounds
before
they
go
back
to
marjorie
who
had
been
trailing
behind
jimmy
called
out
then
now
that
the
blankets
are
airing
penny
can
t
we
go
through
the
stuff
in
the
storage
room
she
broke
into
a
run
and
arrived
by
the
clothesline
almost
out
of
breath
i
can
t
wait
to
see
what
s
in
those
old
probably
nothing
but
junk
jimmy
said
you
know
what
uncle
john
always
called
this
when
they
had
first
come
to
the
michigan
house
early
in
the
fall
they
had
expected
to
find
a
shack
because
their
uncle
john
had
always
referred
to
it
as
the
michigan
but
in
spite
of
its
name
it
had
turned
out
to
be
a
very
pretentious
log
structure
evidently
built
for
just
such
a
purpose
as
they
were
planning
to
put
it
to
now
allen
lodge
was
imposing
with
its
wide
front
and
its
porches
the
spacious
living
room
was
two
stories
high
with
the
bedrooms
opening
off
a
balcony
which
extended
around
three
sides
of
the
room
the
large
dining
room
kitchen
and
pantry
were
on
the
lake
side
there
were
great
fireplaces
in
many
of
the
rooms
and
philip
said
that
it
must
have
been
planned
as
a
summer
hotel
or
a
hunting
lodge
because
the
arrangement
was
ideal
for
large
numbers
of
people
the
interior
with
its
lovely
rafters
and
paneled
walls
was
a
delight
to
the
eye
and
even
better
it
was
easy
to
take
care
of
allen
lodge
suggested
nothing
but
comfort
no
one
knew
of
its
secret
room
except
the
allens
and
their
newly
made
friend
they
had
heard
when
they
first
came
here
that
the
house
was
haunted
but
it
had
not
taken
them
long
to
discover
that
the
ghost
was
only
adra
prentice
a
very
nice
girl
whom
they
had
discovered
hiding
in
the
secret
room
adra
who
was
eighteen
years
old
had
haunted
the
allen
s
house
when
she
had
run
away
from
her
kidnappers
their
adventures
and
the
way
they
solved
the
mystery
is
told
in
allen
and
the
mystery
of
the
haunted
the
four
allens
were
now
ready
for
a
new
adventure
and
they
felt
that
their
own
house
was
the
best
place
to
find
it
those
old
trunks
aren
t
filled
with
junk
marjorie
was
saying
to
jimmy
penny
and
i
looked
into
one
of
them
and
it
s
positively
overflowing
with
fascinating
old
dresses
that
would
be
wonderful
if
we
give
a
masquerade
and
there
s
an
old
jewelry
box
filled
to
the
brim
penny
finished
smiling
with
costume
jewelry
not
worth
a
see
jimmy
demanded
grinning
at
marjorie
he
turned
to
phil
pat
asked
me
to
plant
some
beans
in
his
garden
behind
the
cabin
the
donahues
are
going
to
occupy
if
you
don
t
need
me
i
ll
go
do
it
go
ahead
phil
said
it
won
t
take
pat
ryan
who
had
been
uncle
john
s
guide
and
the
caretaker
of
the
lodge
had
just
married
ann
mary
he
and
his
new
wife
had
voluntarily
taken
over
the
responsibility
of
helping
the
allens
philip
and
penny
realized
they
would
be
lost
without
the
ryans
in
this
undertaking
as
philip
said
they
ve
completely
spoiled
us
i
wouldn
t
think
of
doing
anything
without
first
consulting
pat
he
seems
to
know
everything
about
everything
and
as
luck
would
have
it
we
know
next
to
nothing
about
anything
fate
must
have
brought
us
together
or
better
yet
uncle
john
must
have
had
us
in
mind
when
he
first
got
pat
to
work
for
penny
agreed
wholeheartedly
with
phil
pat
s
orders
she
told
jimmy
before
he
started
off
to
plant
beans
must
always
be
she
pointed
gaily
to
the
blankets
that
were
swaying
and
billowing
in
the
sunny
june
breeze
see
what
i
ve
done
with
our
household
chattels
to
think
i
might
have
gone
through
life
only
knowing
about
readin
writin
and
rithmetic
if
ann
mary
hadn
t
taken
me
in
hand
and
shown
me
how
to
run
a
don
t
feel
so
cocky
sis
said
jimmy
an
impish
grin
on
his
face
you
probably
have
lots
more
to
learn
all
i
can
say
is
you
d
better
hurry
up
and
acquire
the
missing
knowledge
before
peter
gets
penny
blushed
at
the
mention
of
peter
wyland
s
name
even
though
he
was
an
old
friend
and
the
allens
had
known
him
for
years
he
had
just
recently
shown
his
preference
for
penny
s
company
and
penny
was
still
not
used
to
being
teased
about
it
phil
shrewdly
guessed
that
penny
had
been
in
love
with
peter
ever
since
last
winter
that
was
when
they
had
discovered
that
peter
was
a
secret
service
man
in
the
employ
of
prentice
phil
had
not
talked
to
penny
about
peter
even
when
he
noticed
that
she
seemed
to
get
letters
from
wyland
quite
regularly
philip
s
mind
these
days
was
much
preoccupied
with
thoughts
of
adra
prentice
he
seemed
unable
to
get
her
out
of
his
mind
and
he
found
that
no
matter
what
he
was
doing
his
thoughts
would
always
go
back
to
adra
both
phil
and
penny
knew
that
jimmy
and
marjorie
would
never
stop
teasing
them
about
their
feelings
so
contrary
to
their
usual
method
of
discussing
everything
among
themselves
they
had
not
said
anything
about
this
nevertheless
it
seemed
to
be
more
or
less
understood
and
although
penny
couldn
t
help
blushing
she
pretended
to
ignore
jimmy
s
teasing
remark
get
along
with
you
phil
said
to
his
younger
brother
if
you
don
t
plant
those
beans
soon
they
ll
sprout
in
your
jimmy
departed
laughing
come
on
he
called
over
his
shoulder
to
marjorie
i
ll
let
you
help
me
for
a
change
even
can
t
botch
up
a
job
as
simple
as
planting
thank
you
no
marjorie
said
with
dignity
i
weeded
all
day
yesterday
while
you
were
marjorie
had
not
missed
penny
s
blush
and
couldn
t
resist
a
chance
for
teasing
her
older
sister
why
are
your
cheeks
so
pink
penny
she
asked
carelessly
she
s
getting
sunburned
phil
said
quickly
coming
to
penny
s
rescue
if
you
spent
more
time
looking
in
the
mirror
marjorie
you
d
see
that
your
own
nose
is
as
red
as
a
just
then
an
old
ford
drew
up
in
front
of
the
house
pat
ryan
got
out
followed
by
the
new
summer
help
theresa
who
was
pat
s
sister
and
lived
in
the
nearby
village
had
a
smile
on
her
broad
irish
face
the
allens
loved
her
irish
brogue
and
her
tremendous
bulk
marjorie
said
she
was
worth
her
weight
in
gold
it
s
glad
i
am
to
be
here
working
for
the
allens
she
said
penny
welcomed
her
and
said
it
s
we
who
are
glad
you
could
come
theresa
and
the
rest
of
you
too
we
d
never
be
able
to
swing
this
experiment
if
it
weren
t
for
the
ryans
and
you
and
we
think
you
re
bricks
to
do
this
on
a
basis
because
right
now
we
don
t
know
if
we
ll
make
a
profit
or
lose
don
t
you
go
worrying
about
a
little
thing
like
that
answered
theresa
and
with
a
wink
at
pat
she
added
anybody
that
finds
out
about
ann
mary
s
cooking
will
gladly
pay
double
the
fee
you
re
charging
if
pat
isn
t
going
to
be
too
jealous
to
let
anybody
else
taste
that
good
okay
with
me
said
pat
providing
i
get
my
slowly
following
behind
theresa
were
two
people
the
allens
had
never
met
penny
and
phil
shook
their
hands
as
theresa
introduced
them
this
is
and
mal
donahue
ann
mary
s
cousins
donahue
was
kathleen
doherty
and
we
always
call
her
kitty
it
s
a
cinch
your
help
will
all
be
getting
along
fine
together
since
we
re
all
irish
and
all
related
seems
as
though
all
the
irish
are
related
to
each
other
doesn
t
it
this
brought
forth
gales
of
laughter
from
jimmy
who
had
interrupted
his
work
in
the
garden
to
greet
the
new
arrivals
i
hope
you
like
your
cabin
he
said
to
the
donahues
all
of
our
vegetables
are
growing
right
in
your
back
yard
so
whenever
you
get
hungry
all
you
have
to
do
is
reach
out
the
window
and
pick
some
pole
they
smiled
at
him
while
philip
said
we
hope
you
will
be
happy
with
us
mal
and
mal
donahue
cleared
his
throat
we
d
like
the
job
sir
uh
er
and
he
hesitated
we
were
ahem
curious
you
see
we
heard
the
house
was
haunted
last
winter
and
some
people
say
there
s
hidden
treasure
around
here
we
hope
it
s
just
a
plain
ordinary
house
kitty
and
i
don
t
like
this
speech
was
made
with
some
effort
and
once
again
jimmy
couldn
t
control
his
amusement
he
laughed
and
slapped
mal
on
the
back
if
there
s
any
treasure
old
man
you
and
i
will
find
it
this
seemed
to
reassure
mal
when
philip
and
penny
walked
toward
the
lodge
later
she
said
i
think
we
are
lucky
phil
to
get
these
young
folks
i
like
their
looks
don
t
you
i
certainly
do
philip
agreed
and
pat
and
ann
mary
will
need
all
the
extra
help
they
can
get
if
things
work
out
the
way
we
hope
they
will
we
ll
have
to
hire
more
people
from
the
penny
nodded
i
m
very
pleased
with
kitty
she
looks
like
a
dear
and
she
ll
make
a
nice
appearance
waiting
on
the
she
sighed
it
s
too
bad
anyone
as
attractive
as
ann
mary
must
stay
in
the
kitchen
most
of
the
don
t
worry
about
that
phil
said
with
a
laugh
i
m
sure
all
our
guests
will
want
to
go
back
and
tell
her
how
good
her
food
is
and
they
ll
get
to
know
her
that
way
besides
he
went
on
she
won
t
stay
in
the
kitchen
all
the
time
even
if
she
s
supposed
to
do
nothing
but
cook
you
know
ann
mary
will
pitch
in
and
help
the
others
whenever
she
has
any
spare
that
s
true
penny
said
thoughtfully
and
i
m
beginning
to
see
what
you
mean
about
our
getting
organized
we
really
should
all
work
according
to
some
sort
of
schedule
so
we
won
t
be
getting
in
each
other
s
exactly
philip
said
we
must
have
a
serious
meeting
this
evening
and
assign
definite
tasks
to
each
one
of
right
after
dinner
penny
agreed
now
before
we
go
back
to
work
in
the
house
let
s
read
the
mail
the
postman
left
on
the
porch
a
while
ago
i
i
she
confided
i
m
sort
of
hoping
i
ll
hear
from
peter
wyland
he
s
not
sure
he
can
take
a
vacation
from
his
job
until
the
end
of
cheer
up
sis
phil
said
encouragingly
maybe
there
ll
be
a
letter
from
him
saying
he
can
come
they
hurried
up
the
steps
to
the
porch
where
a
stack
of
letters
was
waiting
for
them
chapter
an
anonymous
letter
the
first
letter
penny
opened
was
from
the
curtises
saying
that
they
would
arrive
in
about
a
week
the
first
weekend
in
july
that
is
curtis
wrote
if
it
won
t
be
rushing
you
too
much
penny
and
curtis
whom
the
allens
fondly
called
grandma
and
grandpa
curtis
had
been
old
friends
of
uncle
john
s
their
daughter
mary
and
their
son
charles
were
the
same
age
as
penny
and
philip
and
they
had
spent
many
summers
together
in
camps
they
were
to
be
the
first
guests
at
allen
lodge
and
were
planning
to
stay
the
entire
summer
when
curtis
had
heard
about
the
ideal
fishing
his
family
had
difficulty
restraining
him
from
coming
up
before
the
lodge
was
really
open
for
business
the
curtises
are
always
doing
something
to
help
us
brightly
asserted
penny
as
she
finished
the
letter
out
on
the
big
front
porch
she
and
philip
looked
out
on
the
lawn
a
wide
trimmed
space
in
front
of
the
house
its
grass
thick
its
masses
of
shrubbery
and
groups
of
beautiful
trees
stately
and
its
flowers
just
beginning
to
bloom
truly
summer
had
come
to
the
shores
of
lake
superior
and
phil
surveyed
the
property
with
great
pride
watching
the
expression
on
his
face
penny
said
uncle
john
certainly
had
good
taste
phil
you
have
every
reason
to
be
proud
of
your
i
know
it
phil
said
but
don
t
forget
to
give
credit
where
it
is
due
jimmy
and
i
have
done
a
good
job
of
and
if
i
do
say
so
he
stretched
his
long
arms
that
kind
of
work
is
a
real
muscle
i
ll
bet
it
is
penny
said
and
it
s
grand
to
know
that
i
ll
have
plenty
of
flowers
for
the
dining
room
tables
and
for
every
bedroom
in
the
lodge
pat
takes
very
good
care
of
the
cutting
flowers
in
his
garden
if
you
and
jimmy
take
as
good
care
of
the
flowering
shrubs
the
lodge
will
be
a
bower
of
blossoms
inside
and
out
all
marjorie
and
jimmy
came
out
on
the
porch
then
with
their
hands
full
of
more
mail
that
pat
had
brought
back
when
he
went
into
town
for
theresa
and
the
donahues
lo
said
jimmy
help
us
sort
this
out
gobs
came
in
today
after
the
postman
jimmy
sat
down
in
one
of
the
large
wicker
chairs
and
marjorie
drew
up
a
little
footstool
in
front
of
him
go
ahead
said
philip
we
ll
trust
you
and
marjorie
to
sort
it
all
out
and
hand
it
over
won
t
we
penny
only
too
glad
to
have
you
do
it
replied
penny
slumping
down
in
her
chair
and
pretending
to
relax
only
don
t
take
too
long
if
anything
looks
interesting
she
added
jimmy
s
answer
to
that
was
to
toss
a
flat
letter
into
her
lap
and
to
follow
that
closely
with
another
slimmer
one
carefully
twirled
by
its
corner
to
insure
its
falling
at
the
proper
distance
oh
don
t
jimmy
protested
marjorie
over
whose
head
the
missives
were
hurled
that
will
keep
her
quiet
marge
jimmy
announced
but
penny
was
already
quiet
not
even
hearing
jimmy
s
last
remark
you
have
the
biggest
pile
phil
marjorie
stated
in
a
few
moments
the
pile
in
front
of
phil
was
falling
over
with
letters
papers
advertisements
and
catalogues
the
process
of
dividing
the
mail
was
soon
completed
and
silence
reigned
except
for
giggles
from
marjorie
as
she
read
a
long
letter
from
her
best
friend
judy
powell
penny
deeply
engrossed
in
one
of
hers
gave
a
slight
exclamation
once
and
philip
whistled
as
he
laid
aside
a
long
envelope
but
no
one
stopped
to
ask
questions
penny
looked
at
the
absorbed
group
as
she
finished
her
last
letter
and
smiled
marjorie
stopped
reading
her
letters
and
looked
off
into
space
read
me
some
of
judy
s
letter
marjorie
said
penny
marjorie
turned
with
a
smile
to
say
that
it
was
such
a
good
letter
and
so
funny
judy
wants
to
know
by
telegram
when
they
can
she
shall
marjorie
philip
answered
immediately
i
m
thinking
of
getting
a
special
telegram
blank
marjorie
looked
at
phil
to
see
if
he
really
meant
such
an
idiotic
thing
but
as
phil
only
winked
at
her
she
merely
said
crazy
and
turned
to
judy
s
letter
dearest
marjorie
i
think
it
s
simply
tops
that
we
can
be
together
this
summer
i
was
so
afraid
my
parents
would
insist
on
sending
me
to
camp
again
not
that
i
don
t
like
camp
but
i
know
it
s
going
to
be
so
much
more
exciting
to
do
things
together
like
exploring
in
the
woods
will
we
be
allowed
to
go
through
the
woods
by
ourselves
are
there
secret
cabins
or
wonderful
hiding
places
can
we
sleep
out
at
night
i
ll
bet
it
s
wonderful
swimming
in
lake
superior
oh
couldn
t
you
telegraph
and
let
me
know
right
away
when
we
can
come
i
have
so
many
questions
to
ask
i
don
t
know
where
to
begin
my
brother
alf
says
he
would
rather
come
to
michigan
than
go
on
the
canoe
trip
in
canada
he
says
he
always
has
fun
with
jimmy
maybe
the
boys
will
let
us
help
them
build
something
or
do
some
of
the
things
with
them
alf
says
they
ll
never
take
us
fishing
because
girls
talk
too
much
but
maybe
we
can
convince
them
that
we
know
how
to
keep
quiet
i
m
so
excited
that
at
last
we
are
going
to
see
the
lodge
and
all
the
allens
and
especially
you
that
s
all
i
can
write
about
do
charles
curtis
and
peter
wyland
both
still
like
penny
does
penny
like
either
one
of
them
maybe
i
should
be
minding
my
own
business
but
i
guess
i
am
just
bubbling
over
with
questions
cincinnati
is
hot
as
it
always
is
in
the
summer
and
we
can
t
wait
until
we
get
to
michigan
quick
quick
quick
send
me
a
telegram
it
will
be
the
first
one
i
ever
received
at
present
i
just
live
in
a
bathing
suit
and
we
spend
almost
all
day
at
the
pool
i
m
glad
school
is
out
alf
says
i
m
a
nuisance
and
a
question
box
and
by
now
you
probably
think
the
same
i
can
t
wait
until
i
see
you
forever
yours
when
marjorie
had
finished
reading
judy
s
letter
out
loud
jimmy
chuckled
she
s
a
riot
that
powell
penny
was
already
scribbling
a
message
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
here
she
said
to
jimmy
go
in
to
the
phone
in
the
office
and
send
this
telegram
to
judy
right
away
there
s
no
reason
why
the
powells
shouldn
t
come
the
first
weekend
in
july
when
we
expect
the
hooray
marjorie
shouted
as
jimmy
went
in
to
send
the
telegram
at
that
moment
kitty
donahue
came
out
on
the
porch
hi
marjorie
greeted
her
when
do
we
eat
in
this
lodge
kitty
came
nearer
i
just
wanted
to
ask
miss
penny
about
that
we
ve
a
big
fish
baking
and
i
wondered
if
you
would
be
ready
to
eat
in
half
an
hooray
food
shouted
marjorie
we
re
always
ready
to
eat
kitty
are
we
going
to
have
a
conference
tonight
to
assign
various
duties
penny
yes
we
are
penny
answered
kitty
did
you
ever
help
in
a
summer
hotel
or
anything
like
that
yes
and
mal
helped
the
chef
at
one
of
the
lake
resorts
right
near
here
that
is
what
made
ann
mary
think
about
sending
for
philip
had
turned
to
look
at
kathleen
while
she
talked
that
is
very
fortunate
for
us
donahue
he
said
we
re
going
to
have
a
family
confab
tonight
to
decide
what
each
of
us
should
do
and
we
d
like
all
of
you
to
come
and
help
us
make
yes
sir
kitty
said
we
ll
not
need
much
more
help
only
some
people
from
around
the
village
to
wait
on
table
if
there
is
a
very
large
crowd
over
weekends
or
for
some
special
with
that
bit
of
advice
kitty
went
back
into
the
house
jimmy
came
out
on
the
porch
then
and
said
to
marjorie
i
told
the
operator
to
sign
your
name
to
the
telegram
i
thought
judy
would
get
a
kick
out
of
thanks
marjorie
said
smiling
sometimes
you
can
be
nice
he
ignored
her
and
started
gathering
up
his
mail
by
the
way
he
said
to
penny
and
phil
my
old
schoolmate
brook
is
coming
that
weekend
too
if
it
s
all
right
with
fine
penny
and
phil
said
together
jimmy
grinned
brook
wrote
that
he
is
going
to
bring
all
of
his
old
clothes
he
says
he
ll
bring
one
decent
suit
but
he
hopes
he
ll
not
have
to
put
it
on
i
m
right
with
him
there
i
think
judy
powell
has
the
right
idea
about
living
in
a
bathing
suit
all
summer
say
alf
powell
brook
and
i
will
certainly
have
some
wonderful
fun
this
summer
maybe
we
can
put
up
a
shack
for
us
to
sleep
he
went
on
pacing
up
and
down
excitedly
or
part
of
that
old
barn
it
would
be
fun
if
we
could
be
by
calm
down
jimmy
phil
said
i
don
t
think
alf
s
or
brook
s
parents
will
think
their
sons
ought
to
be
sleeping
in
a
shack
if
they
are
paying
good
money
for
rooms
do
you
jimmy
ran
his
hands
through
his
short
dark
hair
naw
i
guess
not
but
we
could
bunk
out
there
sometimes
couldn
t
we
of
course
penny
told
him
it
wouldn
t
be
much
fun
if
you
didn
t
rough
it
every
now
and
she
went
on
seriously
i
m
counting
on
you
jimmy
to
keep
an
eye
on
any
kids
who
may
come
with
their
parents
you
and
marjorie
must
help
to
keep
them
amused
too
it
will
be
rather
like
running
a
summer
camp
with
you
two
as
junior
counselors
you
ll
have
to
supervise
games
and
sports
and
maybe
jimmy
give
some
of
them
swimming
ha
jimmy
narrowed
his
eyes
the
plot
thickens
looks
like
i
m
going
to
have
to
work
but
don
t
worry
penny
brook
alf
and
i
will
keep
the
small
fry
grand
penny
said
approvingly
you
ve
taken
a
load
off
my
mind
jimmy
everyone
has
simply
got
to
help
me
as
much
as
possible
if
we
re
going
to
see
to
it
that
our
guests
are
kept
she
glanced
at
marjorie
and
that
means
you
too
imp
don
t
you
dare
spend
all
your
time
with
your
chum
i
won
t
marjorie
promised
not
unless
jimmy
spends
all
his
time
with
alf
and
philip
glanced
at
his
wrist
watch
any
objections
to
you
two
getting
washed
up
before
dinner
but
he
looked
at
jimmy
as
he
spoke
not
a
one
returned
jimmy
with
a
wide
grin
i
wonder
why
phil
looked
at
me
he
continued
still
grinning
because
you
re
practically
just
past
the
stage
when
getting
you
washed
behind
the
ears
was
quite
a
family
problem
said
marjorie
look
who
s
talking
called
jimmy
as
he
disappeared
into
the
house
after
they
had
all
consumed
the
delicious
baked
fish
which
pat
had
caught
that
very
day
and
ann
mary
had
fixed
in
a
delectable
fashion
all
the
allens
met
around
the
council
table
this
was
the
big
table
in
the
living
room
and
here
they
were
soon
joined
by
the
ryans
theresa
and
the
donahues
philip
then
outlined
a
plan
which
they
all
discussed
and
finally
the
duties
were
assigned
to
everyone
s
satisfaction
pat
was
to
continue
what
he
had
always
done
and
be
a
general
overseer
of
the
entire
lodge
he
would
make
arrangements
for
fishing
parties
get
boats
and
guides
and
order
lunches
to
be
packed
he
would
lock
up
every
night
and
do
many
other
things
ann
mary
was
in
complete
charge
of
the
kitchen
and
mal
and
kitty
were
to
be
her
assistants
kitty
would
serve
and
mal
also
had
some
outdoor
duties
theresa
was
to
do
the
cleaning
and
mal
and
kitty
were
going
to
pitch
in
and
help
with
that
too
marjorie
had
offered
to
wait
on
table
and
help
with
the
cooking
but
philip
told
her
that
the
family
would
have
their
hands
full
with
the
entertaining
of
their
guests
however
all
the
allens
planned
to
help
out
every
place
all
of
the
time
whenever
they
were
free
from
their
other
assigned
duties
jimmy
had
lettered
a
large
sign
and
hung
it
on
a
temporary
billboard
it
read
meeting
of
the
board
of
directors
of
allen
lodge
marjorie
now
pointed
to
the
sign
and
said
i
feel
pretty
important
being
a
director
is
that
why
i
can
get
out
of
cooking
and
serving
at
this
remark
phil
guffawed
and
jimmy
and
penny
joined
him
much
to
marjorie
s
chagrin
don
t
you
kid
yourself
jimmy
said
even
if
phil
says
you
ll
have
your
hands
full
entertaining
guests
you
know
you
ll
have
them
twice
as
full
because
i
m
sure
we
ll
all
have
to
help
each
other
when
our
lodge
is
running
full
philip
it
was
decided
was
to
be
the
official
treasurer
he
would
keep
the
books
and
have
full
charge
of
all
receipts
and
disbursements
that
jimmy
loftily
explained
to
marjorie
means
money
coming
in
and
money
going
marjorie
sniffed
keep
your
definitions
of
such
simple
words
to
let
s
be
serious
phil
said
all
hotels
and
inns
have
a
rule
that
unless
their
guests
deposit
their
valuables
with
them
for
safekeeping
the
management
is
not
responsible
isn
t
that
right
donahue
mal
nodded
well
then
phil
went
on
i
think
we
ought
to
keep
our
guests
money
and
jewelry
in
the
safe
in
the
secret
room
and
in
order
to
safeguard
the
secret
we
ought
to
make
it
a
rule
that
none
of
the
guests
is
allowed
in
the
secret
right
jimmy
agreed
heartily
if
we
let
everyone
run
in
and
out
of
there
it
won
t
be
a
secret
very
long
i
vote
that
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
only
pat
is
allowed
to
phil
pat
penny
interrupted
phil
has
to
go
in
and
out
to
the
safe
because
he
s
the
that
s
right
pat
agreed
i
ll
act
as
his
substitute
phil
may
not
be
available
at
times
when
we
receive
money
which
should
be
put
right
in
the
safe
or
when
we
need
to
take
some
out
to
pay
bills
i
ll
only
go
into
the
secret
room
during
such
okay
thanks
pat
said
phil
then
as
of
now
it
s
a
rule
that
only
you
and
i
press
the
button
that
opens
the
secret
door
said
rule
to
remain
in
effect
until
the
end
of
the
everyone
agreed
and
then
it
was
decided
that
penny
was
to
be
the
hostess
and
the
housekeeper
ann
mary
was
going
to
help
make
out
the
shopping
lists
while
penny
did
the
actual
shopping
marjorie
was
to
be
the
assistant
hostess
as
well
as
the
secretary
luckily
she
had
learned
how
to
use
a
typewriter
and
would
really
be
a
big
help
when
it
came
to
writing
letters
jimmy
was
the
director
of
all
sports
and
even
though
that
sounded
like
an
easy
job
penny
assured
him
it
would
be
more
than
a
one
penny
ann
mary
and
kitty
decided
it
would
be
wise
to
make
out
menus
for
a
week
in
advance
that
means
penny
said
that
right
after
breakfast
tomorrow
morning
we
had
better
plan
the
first
week
s
menu
an
awful
lot
of
guests
are
arriving
the
first
weekend
in
she
sighed
wearily
i
guess
everything
has
been
taken
care
of
except
the
laundry
we
ll
all
have
our
hands
full
after
this
week
so
i
don
t
see
what
we
can
possibly
do
about
got
any
ideas
ann
mary
philip
asked
ann
mary
thought
for
a
minute
there
s
a
new
in
the
village
just
opened
the
other
day
if
we
could
find
someone
who
would
come
out
twice
a
week
bring
in
the
soiled
linen
wash
it
in
one
of
the
automatic
machines
and
bring
it
back
damp
dry
kitty
theresa
and
i
could
handle
the
a
swell
idea
pat
said
i
ll
ask
around
in
the
village
when
i
go
in
tomorrow
anyone
even
a
mere
man
he
added
with
a
chuckle
can
run
one
of
those
slot
machines
all
we
need
to
do
is
find
someone
with
a
car
who
ll
tote
the
stuff
back
and
forth
for
a
fair
i
guess
that
takes
care
of
everything
penny
said
has
anybody
thought
of
anything
else
jimmy
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
buy
a
sailboat
but
that
suggestion
was
promptly
vetoed
we
are
going
to
try
and
make
money
before
we
spend
it
young
man
said
philip
but
if
you
and
alf
and
brook
sanders
want
to
fix
up
one
out
of
what
we
have
that
s
all
right
with
watch
us
retorted
jimmy
and
immediately
suggested
that
a
few
canoes
wouldn
t
cost
much
but
once
again
phil
put
a
damper
on
his
ideas
at
this
point
jimmy
wanted
to
know
what
kind
of
a
suggestion
he
could
make
that
would
not
be
vetoed
and
penny
and
phil
both
chimed
in
at
once
with
let
s
call
it
a
but
before
the
meeting
breaks
up
philip
said
soberly
i
want
to
make
an
announcement
i
don
t
think
it
s
really
important
but
i
think
you
should
all
hear
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
long
envelope
he
had
laid
aside
earlier
when
they
had
been
out
on
the
porch
reading
their
mail
i
got
an
anonymous
letter
today
he
said
and
at
first
i
thought
i
wouldn
t
bother
you
with
it
writers
of
anonymous
letters
are
usually
either
cowards
or
cranks
however
he
continued
after
thinking
it
over
i
ve
decided
i
have
no
right
to
keep
from
you
the
fact
that
we
have
been
threatened
penny
repeated
but
phil
who
for
answer
phil
opened
the
envelope
and
took
out
a
long
sheet
of
dirty
paper
which
he
laid
on
the
council
table
everyone
crowded
around
him
to
read
the
ugly
scribbled
words
philip
allen
if
you
know
what
s
good
for
you
and
your
family
and
friends
get
out
of
the
lodge
as
fast
as
you
can
i
mean
business
chapter
the
abandoned
well
ann
mary
was
the
first
to
speak
well
i
never
she
gasped
who
could
have
written
such
an
evil
thing
pat
pat
shook
his
head
a
crank
of
that
s
what
i
think
phil
agreed
someone
who
read
the
newspaper
stories
about
adra
prentice
s
kidnaping
anonymous
letters
from
people
who
aren
t
quite
right
mentally
generally
follow
any
kind
of
but
marjorie
objected
all
of
that
happened
last
it
makes
no
difference
jimmy
told
her
people
use
newspapers
for
lots
of
things
besides
keeping
up
with
the
news
they
wrap
china
in
newspapers
line
shelves
and
drawers
with
em
for
instance
whoever
wrote
that
dopey
letter
may
have
come
across
an
account
of
adra
s
kidnaping
just
the
other
penny
nodded
let
s
tear
the
ugly
thing
up
and
throw
it
away
whoever
wrote
it
probably
won
t
ever
bother
us
jimmy
tore
the
dirty
sheet
of
paper
to
shreds
and
tossed
them
into
the
fireplace
phil
set
a
match
to
them
and
they
all
watched
the
scraps
burn
away
to
ashes
well
that
s
that
penny
said
as
if
anyone
could
scare
us
allens
away
from
the
lodge
then
the
meeting
did
break
up
and
four
very
tired
but
not
at
all
frightened
allens
went
upstairs
to
bed
the
next
morning
jimmy
s
first
job
was
to
overhaul
the
old
bus
and
the
bronc
the
bronc
was
an
old
station
wagon
that
had
seen
better
days
it
had
served
the
allens
well
but
right
now
it
sputtered
and
rattled
and
wheezed
the
bus
was
a
small
truck
and
was
used
for
a
multitude
of
things
it
hauled
wood
from
the
woods
to
the
woodbin
it
carted
supplies
from
the
town
to
the
lodge
and
philip
planned
to
use
it
for
taking
people
on
camping
trips
during
the
summer
jimmy
s
favorite
pastime
was
tinkering
with
cars
and
he
seemed
to
know
the
intricate
mechanics
of
the
two
old
vehicles
better
than
any
trained
mechanic
while
jimmy
was
tinkering
with
the
motors
phil
and
mal
combed
the
nearby
woods
for
timber
some
of
it
would
be
cut
up
into
logs
which
would
blaze
merrily
in
the
huge
fireplaces
on
cool
evenings
the
rest
of
it
phil
planned
to
give
jimmy
for
his
shack
jimmy
had
picked
a
spot
on
the
lake
shore
where
he
and
the
other
boys
could
build
a
fire
if
they
wanted
he
also
planned
to
build
a
little
dock
and
rent
a
few
rowboats
this
was
to
be
the
bachelor
s
retreat
the
site
was
in
a
bit
of
a
bay
with
some
large
rocks
along
the
shore
line
that
would
make
the
dock
construction
simpler
among
the
trees
a
little
way
back
there
was
a
fairly
open
place
where
the
shack
could
stand
when
phil
and
mal
had
gathered
quite
a
pile
of
wood
they
called
jimmy
down
to
view
the
spot
now
all
you
have
to
do
jimmy
is
to
go
to
it
said
philip
i
can
t
wait
until
the
other
boys
arrive
to
get
started
he
answered
i
m
going
to
start
preparing
the
logs
and
lay
the
floor
won
t
this
be
ideal
in
the
meantime
marjorie
began
her
secretarial
duties
by
sorting
mail
and
answering
as
many
of
the
letters
as
she
could
while
penny
went
into
the
village
to
shop
in
order
to
stock
up
on
staples
and
to
make
arrangements
for
her
weekly
orders
one
afternoon
jimmy
phil
and
mal
decided
to
have
a
look
at
the
long
old
shed
in
the
back
yard
which
they
thought
might
be
fixed
up
to
house
the
cars
of
their
summer
guests
the
old
shed
had
been
there
all
the
time
of
course
but
somehow
they
had
kept
putting
off
the
time
when
they
would
examine
it
there
had
been
so
many
things
to
do
when
they
first
came
they
had
not
even
opened
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
until
they
had
decided
to
turn
it
into
a
summer
hotel
now
the
guest
rooms
must
be
cleaned
and
aired
penny
and
marjorie
were
busy
from
morning
to
night
helping
theresa
and
ann
mary
dust
and
make
beds
this
is
so
boring
marjorie
complained
the
only
room
i
m
interested
in
is
the
old
storage
room
penny
when
are
we
ever
going
to
go
through
those
old
trunks
we
ve
had
a
look
at
the
contents
of
one
of
them
penny
pointed
out
patiently
and
we
found
that
it
contained
nothing
but
some
very
clothes
and
a
few
worthless
though
pretty
trinkets
wait
till
we
have
more
time
honey
then
you
may
rummage
around
in
there
to
your
heart
s
i
can
t
understand
your
lack
of
curiosity
marjorie
moaned
i
can
t
sleep
nights
thinking
about
what
might
be
in
the
trunk
we
didn
t
penny
laughed
i
guess
we
ve
had
too
much
indoor
work
for
one
day
let
s
join
the
boys
down
at
the
goody
goody
marjorie
cried
flinging
down
her
dust
cloth
there
s
bound
to
be
something
more
exciting
than
cobwebs
out
at
last
they
were
hurrying
down
the
concrete
walk
past
the
donahues
small
cabin
behind
the
lodge
they
caught
up
with
mal
and
the
boys
on
the
old
graveled
drive
overgrown
with
weeds
this
drive
led
among
bushes
and
trees
and
looked
like
an
old
horse
trail
but
it
was
wide
enough
for
a
car
to
travel
over
it
with
care
jimmy
took
one
good
look
at
all
the
weeds
and
said
i
don
t
think
this
is
such
a
good
idea
especially
since
i
know
i
ll
be
elected
a
committee
of
one
to
cut
down
all
these
why
how
did
you
guess
it
young
man
you
are
getting
keen
laughed
penny
but
this
really
does
look
like
a
big
job
and
i
m
sure
phil
and
mal
will
lend
a
hand
jimmy
looked
relieved
at
this
suggestion
and
here
they
were
at
the
shed
pat
says
that
even
your
uncle
john
never
made
use
of
this
shed
for
anything
and
that
it
must
have
been
a
sort
of
stable
back
in
the
old
days
explained
mal
see
one
of
the
side
walls
is
pretty
badly
broken
up
but
the
roof
has
been
patched
and
the
framework
seems
strong
there
are
a
pile
of
boards
and
some
poles
behind
this
shed
looks
as
though
somebody
once
had
the
idea
of
repairing
it
that
wood
back
there
is
well
seasoned
and
with
the
help
of
the
repair
man
from
the
village
we
could
get
it
fixed
up
this
penny
took
hold
of
one
of
the
supports
to
which
a
few
boards
were
clinging
loosely
be
careful
how
you
lean
against
that
philip
cautioned
her
that
s
the
broken
wall
and
we
don
t
want
you
to
fall
through
but
just
as
he
finished
saying
it
penny
gasped
and
slipped
out
of
sight
for
a
minute
the
others
stood
there
with
their
mouths
open
then
phil
and
jimmy
quickly
went
into
action
mal
poked
his
hand
through
the
wall
where
penny
seemed
to
have
disappeared
and
marjorie
called
penny
penny
answer
are
you
hurt
phil
and
jimmy
ran
to
the
outside
of
the
broken
wall
but
there
was
nothing
there
but
the
old
pile
of
lumber
mal
had
mentioned
they
called
penny
and
then
there
was
a
muffled
sound
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
very
wall
itself
phil
climbed
right
up
on
top
of
the
pile
of
lumber
and
reached
over
as
far
as
he
could
toward
the
wall
when
he
noticed
a
sunken
place
between
the
wall
and
the
lumber
it
looked
like
an
old
well
and
it
was
partly
covered
he
called
to
penny
and
this
time
he
heard
her
answer
as
quickly
as
they
could
they
all
started
to
move
enough
of
the
lumber
so
that
they
could
get
closer
to
the
old
well
now
they
were
sure
penny
had
fallen
into
it
and
marjorie
ran
back
to
the
house
as
fast
as
her
feet
could
carry
her
to
get
a
strong
rope
and
more
help
it
seemed
like
hours
but
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
before
phil
and
jimmy
were
able
to
lean
over
the
well
and
start
calling
down
to
penny
she
answered
them
this
time
and
they
heard
her
say
quite
clearly
what
happened
whew
jimmy
gasped
clutching
his
forehead
with
relief
you
fell
down
an
old
are
you
all
right
penny
philip
asked
anxiously
i
guess
so
penny
called
back
but
it
s
so
dark
i
can
t
see
don
t
worry
phil
said
in
a
reassuring
voice
we
ll
have
you
out
in
no
marjorie
arrived
then
with
pat
who
had
brought
along
a
long
rope
marjorie
was
very
near
to
tears
don
t
let
penny
know
you
re
frightened
phil
cautioned
her
keep
calling
down
to
her
in
a
cheerful
voice
to
keep
her
courage
pat
tied
a
big
loop
on
the
end
of
the
rope
then
mal
lowered
it
into
the
well
and
phil
called
down
instructions
to
penny
finally
the
rope
reached
her
and
she
put
the
looped
end
around
her
waist
and
held
on
to
it
as
tightly
as
she
could
with
both
hands
while
the
men
pulled
her
up
when
after
what
seemed
an
interminably
long
time
penny
s
head
appeared
marjorie
burst
into
tears
tenderly
they
lifted
penny
out
and
she
immediately
assured
everyone
that
aside
from
being
bruised
and
shaky
she
didn
t
think
she
had
any
broken
bones
or
other
injuries
ann
mary
and
theresa
and
kathleen
had
arrived
on
the
scene
with
water
and
bandages
all
of
which
were
scorned
by
penny
who
said
i
did
a
foolish
thing
and
i
deserved
what
i
got
but
now
that
i
know
i
m
all
right
you
can
all
just
forget
about
me
if
you
keep
on
making
such
a
fuss
i
ll
feel
like
an
of
course
they
all
ignored
her
pleadings
and
made
her
sit
right
down
for
a
few
minutes
while
ann
mary
wiped
her
face
with
a
cloth
dipped
in
cold
water
then
she
examined
penny
carefully
to
make
sure
that
she
could
move
her
arms
and
legs
without
pain
the
only
real
damage
seemed
to
be
to
her
appearance
which
was
quite
ludicrous
now
that
they
knew
she
was
safe
they
had
a
good
laugh
about
it
penny
s
face
and
hands
and
hair
were
covered
with
cobwebs
her
dress
was
ripped
and
her
shoes
were
sopping
wet
when
phil
asked
her
if
there
was
any
water
in
the
well
she
said
she
thought
she
had
stood
in
water
and
of
course
her
wet
shoes
showed
that
she
had
then
everybody
went
back
to
the
house
and
penny
took
a
hot
bath
which
ann
mary
said
would
serve
to
relieve
some
of
the
aches
and
pains
she
was
bound
to
develop
later
from
such
a
fall
phil
and
jimmy
were
all
set
to
go
back
and
examine
the
well
to
see
if
it
was
still
in
good
working
condition
and
if
they
could
find
the
water
source
and
perhaps
get
the
well
into
good
order
when
they
saw
penny
looking
her
fresh
self
again
they
went
back
accompanied
by
pat
and
mal
it
beats
me
pat
said
i
never
knew
there
was
a
well
of
any
kind
on
this
i
ve
heard
rumors
mal
said
there
s
always
been
a
lot
of
talk
in
the
village
about
buried
treasure
in
the
bottom
of
an
old
well
around
i
know
pat
said
and
from
time
to
time
when
the
house
was
empty
people
who
had
no
business
trespassing
came
here
and
tried
to
find
that
well
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
prowlers
he
told
phil
your
uncle
john
did
but
nobody
ever
found
a
he
stopped
and
stared
at
the
hole
well
now
here
it
is
and
now
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
at
anything
i
ve
lived
around
here
all
my
life
and
never
believed
there
was
a
well
here
i
think
we
should
caution
everybody
to
try
and
keep
this
a
secret
so
we
won
t
have
any
prowlers
coming
around
and
we
should
get
busy
and
try
to
dig
up
that
old
well
to
see
if
there
really
is
any
treasure
my
gosh
said
jimmy
do
you
really
think
there
s
treasure
there
what
kind
of
treasure
is
it
supposed
to
be
pat
were
there
ever
pirates
around
here
won
t
alf
and
brook
nearly
die
with
excitement
when
they
hear
about
this
phil
smiled
i
m
afraid
we
can
t
let
you
say
anything
to
them
or
anybody
else
until
we
investigate
this
thoroughly
and
see
if
there
is
any
foundation
to
the
rumor
i
agree
with
pat
since
we
don
t
need
the
well
for
water
i
think
we
should
dig
it
up
at
once
and
solve
this
mystery
of
buried
jimmy
was
all
for
going
right
back
for
picks
and
shovels
so
phil
let
him
go
phil
s
curiosity
was
aroused
and
he
could
understand
jimmy
s
enthusiasm
but
phil
felt
quite
sure
that
they
were
not
on
the
trail
of
buried
treasure
the
lodge
was
supposed
to
be
haunted
he
said
to
mal
and
we
proved
it
wasn
t
now
we
re
about
to
prove
that
there
s
nothing
of
any
value
at
the
bottom
of
this
old
jimmy
came
running
back
then
with
both
hands
full
of
an
assortment
of
picks
shovels
and
garden
spades
they
found
that
it
was
exceedingly
slow
work
since
they
first
had
to
move
the
pile
of
old
lumber
and
debris
that
surrounded
the
old
well
when
they
finally
started
digging
they
found
the
stones
that
formed
the
well
were
impossible
to
move
pat
guessed
that
the
old
well
had
been
there
a
hundred
years
or
longer
jimmy
suggested
that
they
use
dynamite
after
two
hours
of
concentrated
labor
phil
commented
i
don
t
think
even
buried
treasure
is
worth
all
this
but
jimmy
who
was
obviously
in
high
spirits
over
this
adventure
contradicted
phil
with
of
course
it
s
worth
it
phil
you
wait
and
see
what
we
pat
shrugged
i
m
not
thinking
you
should
set
your
heart
on
finding
anything
my
lad
because
there
probably
won
t
be
any
treasure
here
any
more
than
the
house
was
haunted
last
don
t
say
that
pat
countered
jimmy
i
m
not
used
to
working
like
this
without
any
not
much
said
phil
but
all
kidding
aside
jimmy
i
think
pat
is
right
however
we
re
going
to
finish
this
job
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
keep
anybody
else
from
falling
into
it
the
rope
we
lowered
to
penny
went
down
about
thirty
feet
and
i
would
guess
that
we
have
dug
around
the
outside
of
this
old
well
about
ten
feet
deep
is
that
right
pat
pat
nodded
yes
that
s
about
right
and
i
think
if
we
get
out
here
bright
and
early
tomorrow
morning
maybe
we
can
finish
the
job
before
very
reluctantly
jimmy
joined
the
rest
as
they
returned
to
the
house
to
tell
penny
and
marjorie
of
their
progress
chapter
a
night
prowler
that
evening
they
all
decided
to
have
a
picnic
style
supper
in
front
of
the
fireplace
in
the
living
room
i
m
beginning
to
feel
my
bruises
penny
said
cheerfully
but
i
m
not
going
to
let
a
few
aches
and
pains
bother
me
i
was
very
lucky
to
get
off
without
broken
bones
or
you
certainly
were
jimmy
said
and
let
me
tell
you
sis
i
thought
i
d
go
nuts
until
we
finally
heard
your
me
too
marjorie
chimed
in
gosh
penny
it
was
just
about
the
most
awful
few
minutes
of
my
life
well
let
s
not
talk
about
it
any
more
penny
said
the
subject
i
want
to
discuss
is
the
bottom
of
the
well
i
can
t
really
gee
jimmy
interrupted
wouldn
t
it
be
neat
if
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
well
and
find
pieces
of
gold
we
ll
be
on
easy
street
the
rest
of
our
he
added
more
to
himself
than
the
others
the
first
thing
i
ll
do
is
get
a
sailboat
i
ve
found
out
already
that
i
don
t
know
enough
about
naval
architecture
to
build
ha
you
don
t
get
on
easy
street
that
easily
said
penny
besides
i
don
t
remember
feeling
anything
beneath
my
feet
but
slime
and
if
all
you
want
is
a
sailboat
you
d
better
work
for
it
i
like
that
exclaimed
jimmy
and
what
do
you
call
digging
away
at
that
well
if
that
isn
t
work
i
d
like
to
know
what
you
d
call
oh
it
s
work
all
right
penny
said
with
a
laugh
but
i
think
it
s
work
without
any
so
do
i
in
a
way
phil
said
but
the
kids
will
never
be
happy
until
we
get
to
the
bottom
and
prove
that
there
isn
t
any
treasure
buried
you
just
wait
until
tomorrow
marjorie
said
stubbornly
when
we
come
running
up
to
you
penny
with
our
hands
dripping
with
pieces
of
eight
then
you
and
phil
will
eat
those
she
raised
her
voice
i
know
there
s
something
valuable
hidden
around
here
and
i
for
one
am
never
going
to
give
up
until
i
ve
gone
over
every
inch
of
the
place
with
a
comb
you
don
t
have
to
shout
about
it
jimmy
said
if
there
is
something
valuable
around
here
let
s
not
encourage
every
tom
dick
and
harry
in
the
village
to
come
out
and
try
to
find
it
first
although
he
went
on
in
a
more
sympathetic
tone
of
voice
i
know
how
you
feel
marjorie
when
alf
and
brook
get
here
and
we
haven
t
found
any
gold
by
then
they
ll
want
to
dig
up
the
whole
place
dig
if
you
must
penny
said
but
spare
pat
s
flower
beds
i
she
stopped
suddenly
her
finger
to
her
lips
she
touched
phil
s
arm
lightly
and
pointed
to
the
window
whispering
someone
s
out
there
and
i
m
afraid
he
s
heard
every
word
we
they
all
stared
silently
out
through
the
lattice
that
partially
screened
the
court
from
view
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
and
then
from
the
shrubbery
a
shadow
moved
and
melted
into
a
little
clump
of
low
spruces
in
another
second
they
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
slip
around
the
corner
of
the
wing
to
disappear
again
in
the
shadows
of
another
trellis
it
was
a
warm
evening
and
all
of
the
doors
and
windows
were
wide
open
the
man
might
try
to
get
into
the
house
penny
started
to
rise
but
phil
with
his
hand
on
her
arm
shook
his
head
and
whispered
all
of
you
stay
right
here
i
don
t
want
him
to
know
that
we
ve
seen
swiftly
he
tiptoed
across
the
room
to
take
his
pistol
from
the
cabinet
penny
remembered
with
relief
that
phil
always
kept
his
gun
loaded
just
then
she
saw
mal
run
into
the
court
he
had
obviously
seen
the
prowler
from
the
kitchen
window
before
penny
could
shout
a
warning
the
man
darted
from
the
shadows
and
flung
himself
on
mal
s
back
one
arm
around
his
throat
at
almost
the
same
moment
phil
leaped
through
the
window
and
fired
his
gun
into
the
air
as
the
shot
rang
out
penny
closed
her
eyes
opening
them
immediately
she
saw
phil
running
out
of
the
court
with
mal
close
at
his
heels
in
pursuit
of
the
prowler
jimmy
was
just
about
to
jump
through
the
window
to
join
in
the
chase
but
penny
held
him
back
stay
here
with
us
jimmy
she
said
phil
and
mal
can
cope
with
that
marjorie
who
had
for
once
been
speechless
found
her
voice
then
oh
yes
jimmy
she
begged
stay
here
with
us
he
might
come
back
and
we
haven
t
got
a
jimmy
looked
disappointed
but
he
knew
he
could
help
phil
best
by
staying
with
the
girls
ah
that
guy
isn
t
going
to
come
back
he
said
he
stared
gloomily
out
of
the
window
as
pat
ran
across
the
court
to
join
the
others
by
this
time
kitty
and
ann
mary
had
appeared
and
frightened
oh
oh
kitty
cried
i
just
know
my
mal
is
going
to
get
another
shot
rang
out
penny
s
heart
sank
had
the
prowler
fired
the
second
shot
somehow
she
managed
to
disguise
her
fears
and
said
in
a
reassuring
voice
to
kitty
don
t
worry
dear
phil
and
pat
know
how
to
handle
their
they
sure
do
ann
mary
said
bravely
although
penny
could
see
that
she
was
almost
as
terrified
as
her
cousin
my
pat
won
t
let
anything
happen
to
your
theresa
came
in
from
the
hall
then
rubbing
her
eyes
bewilderedly
i
was
asleep
she
said
did
i
hear
a
shot
or
did
i
dream
it
she
looked
so
confused
that
everyone
laughed
and
the
tension
was
eased
you
heard
two
shots
jimmy
told
her
i
guess
the
first
one
woke
you
while
he
was
explaining
what
had
happened
they
heard
footsteps
on
the
graveled
walk
and
in
another
moment
they
could
see
phil
pat
and
mal
slowly
approaching
the
house
everyone
ran
out
to
meet
them
he
got
away
phil
said
ruefully
shouldn
t
we
notify
the
police
penny
asked
phil
shrugged
probably
only
a
tramp
i
fired
in
the
air
to
frighten
him
when
he
jumped
on
but
you
fired
a
second
time
marjorie
said
excitedly
we
were
terrified
for
fear
one
of
you
had
been
that
s
right
jimmy
said
say
phil
how
about
giving
us
a
play
by
play
description
of
what
happened
i
missed
all
the
fun
remember
phil
frowned
we
want
to
look
around
some
more
we
just
came
back
to
be
sure
the
rest
of
you
were
we
re
perfectly
all
right
penny
said
go
ahead
with
your
she
smiled
as
long
as
jimmy
stays
with
us
we
re
perfectly
i
want
to
know
what
happened
jimmy
complained
give
well
phil
said
patiently
from
the
minute
that
man
disappeared
into
the
shrubbery
he
slipped
from
one
tree
to
another
like
an
indian
then
doubled
around
toward
the
it
certainly
sounds
as
though
he
knows
his
way
around
here
marjorie
put
in
phil
nodded
pat
fired
the
second
shot
when
we
saw
him
trying
to
get
away
in
one
of
our
boats
although
pat
fired
into
the
air
it
scared
the
living
daylights
out
of
him
i
guess
he
jumped
from
the
boat
and
made
for
the
woods
below
phil
grinned
i
ll
bet
he
s
still
running
he
may
think
we
re
mighty
poor
shots
but
at
least
he
knows
we
re
armed
i
doubt
if
he
ever
comes
back
on
our
property
but
who
could
it
have
been
penny
asked
a
tramp
wouldn
t
know
his
way
around
our
if
anyone
should
ask
me
pat
said
i
d
say
it
was
one
of
those
crazy
villagers
after
the
buried
treasure
i
ll
bet
the
news
is
all
over
town
already
that
we
found
the
old
well
near
the
but
jimmy
objected
nobody
could
have
heard
about
it
so
a
lot
of
people
could
have
mal
pointed
out
there
were
several
delivery
boys
out
here
during
the
excitement
when
miss
penny
fell
into
the
ann
mary
nodded
we
were
all
so
worried
about
penny
we
didn
t
pay
any
attention
to
them
when
marjorie
came
running
into
the
kitchen
to
tell
us
about
the
accident
i
dashed
out
of
the
house
so
fast
i
almost
knocked
down
one
boy
who
biked
out
here
with
some
pat
shook
his
head
gravely
that
rumor
about
buried
treasure
is
going
to
cause
us
a
lot
of
trouble
we
don
t
want
the
place
cluttered
up
with
night
prowlers
this
let
s
go
have
a
look
at
the
shed
jimmy
said
eagerly
maybe
the
guy
was
down
there
snooping
around
and
sneaked
up
to
the
house
to
make
sure
we
were
all
all
right
phil
said
but
you
have
to
stay
with
the
oh
no
he
doesn
t
marjorie
said
pertly
the
girls
are
going
we
can
t
all
leave
penny
said
wisely
after
all
he
might
have
been
a
burglar
we
would
be
playing
right
into
his
hands
if
we
left
the
house
deserted
with
all
the
doors
and
windows
she
glanced
around
at
the
shadows
with
a
little
shiver
suppose
he
doubled
back
and
is
watching
us
right
now
waiting
to
see
what
we
ll
do
marjorie
moved
a
little
closer
to
penny
oh
isn
t
it
thrilling
she
cried
i
wouldn
t
be
at
all
afraid
to
stay
here
and
guard
the
house
if
i
had
a
not
much
you
wouldn
t
jimmy
jeered
i
for
one
kitty
said
have
no
intention
of
going
down
to
that
shed
i
m
going
into
the
house
and
mal
is
going
with
me
and
we
re
going
to
lock
ourselves
fine
jimmy
said
that
solves
the
problem
phil
can
leave
his
gun
with
mal
just
in
okay
mal
agreed
and
stuck
phil
s
little
pistol
into
his
pocket
after
the
donahues
had
gone
into
the
house
the
others
headed
for
the
shed
jimmy
had
brought
a
flashlight
with
him
and
when
they
got
inside
the
shed
he
flashed
it
all
around
just
as
they
were
about
to
leave
he
shouted
look
and
pointed
to
a
spot
near
the
broken
wall
where
penny
had
fallen
through
earlier
that
day
the
floor
of
the
shed
had
been
opened
and
plainly
showing
in
the
earth
under
it
was
a
footprint
someone
has
been
here
since
we
left
jimmy
cried
excitedly
that
footprint
was
made
by
a
man
wearing
a
shoe
with
a
rubber
sole
and
we
were
all
wearing
you
re
right
phil
said
soberly
but
the
man
who
made
that
footprint
might
not
have
been
our
prowler
it
could
have
been
left
by
one
of
the
delivery
boys
whose
curiosity
was
aroused
when
he
heard
about
penny
s
penny
nodded
one
of
them
might
have
biked
back
out
while
we
were
having
supper
just
to
have
a
look
kids
are
like
but
jimmy
argued
they
don
t
have
such
big
oh
yes
they
do
marjorie
said
with
a
giggle
take
a
look
at
what
s
on
the
end
of
your
own
maybe
the
prowler
was
just
a
curious
kid
penny
said
suddenly
have
you
thought
of
that
phil
philip
thought
for
a
minute
he
had
awfully
broad
shoulders
and
i
don
t
think
a
kid
would
have
jumped
on
he
shrugged
but
i
really
think
whoever
it
was
won
t
come
he
put
the
floor
boards
back
in
place
if
he
does
he
won
t
do
any
digging
for
buried
treasure
at
this
spot
jimmy
go
and
get
the
old
bus
and
park
it
right
jimmy
grinned
with
delight
right
and
if
our
curious
friend
comes
back
to
search
he
ll
have
to
move
the
bus
and
unless
he
s
a
samson
he
ll
have
to
start
her
up
and
when
this
thing
starts
running
he
ll
realize
that
he
s
set
off
the
loudest
fire
alarm
in
he
ran
off
to
get
the
bus
if
we
don
t
find
any
treasure
when
we
dig
up
the
well
marjorie
said
let
s
dig
under
the
floor
definitely
no
phil
told
her
firmly
we
ll
dig
up
the
well
and
let
it
be
known
far
and
wide
that
we
found
nothing
that
should
put
a
stop
to
all
the
silly
pat
nodded
approvingly
and
night
when
they
returned
to
the
house
they
found
that
kitty
and
mal
had
sandwiches
and
a
large
pot
of
hot
cocoa
waiting
for
them
i
think
you
men
should
take
turns
keeping
watch
tonight
kitty
said
nervously
and
please
can
t
we
sleep
in
the
house
tonight
instead
of
in
the
cabin
of
course
you
can
phil
said
and
perhaps
it
isn
t
a
bad
idea
for
us
to
take
turns
keeping
an
eye
on
the
he
smiled
reassuringly
for
the
rest
of
tonight
i
ll
take
one
shift
marjorie
said
suppressing
a
yawn
i
won
t
sleep
a
wink
but
she
did
the
minute
her
head
touched
the
pillow
and
when
she
awoke
in
the
morning
was
very
disappointed
to
hear
that
the
night
had
been
uneventful
at
least
i
didn
t
miss
anything
she
said
as
they
hurriedly
ate
breakfast
on
the
sunny
porch
now
to
find
the
buried
treasure
but
the
whole
day
proved
to
be
a
tremendous
disappointment
they
finally
dug
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
well
and
found
absolutely
nothing
but
mud
and
the
source
of
the
spring
had
evidently
gone
dry
all
that
labor
for
nothing
pat
said
in
a
very
disgruntled
voice
a
wasted
everyone
had
pitched
in
and
helped
at
various
intervals
although
jimmy
and
marjorie
were
the
only
ones
who
never
gave
up
hope
of
finding
gold
pieces
deep
in
the
mud
wearily
the
men
filled
up
the
huge
hole
and
the
rest
of
the
week
was
spent
in
what
ann
mary
called
fruitful
the
shed
was
converted
into
quite
a
presentable
garage
and
at
last
even
phil
admitted
that
they
were
practically
ready
to
open
the
lodge
for
business
they
were
all
so
busy
with
final
preparations
they
dismissed
the
night
prowler
from
their
minds
only
jimmy
and
marjorie
remained
convinced
that
there
was
treasure
buried
on
the
grounds
what
about
the
laundry
situation
phil
asked
penny
the
night
before
the
first
guests
were
expected
have
you
been
able
to
cope
with
that
i
certainly
have
penny
told
him
proudly
several
days
ago
a
very
man
who
looks
strong
enough
to
carry
any
amount
of
damp
linen
drove
out
to
ask
for
the
job
he
d
heard
in
the
village
that
we
wanted
someone
to
tote
a
huge
bundle
into
the
twice
a
week
and
came
right
out
without
even
waiting
to
telephone
for
an
appointment
with
phil
looked
puzzled
i
sort
of
took
it
for
granted
that
you
d
give
the
job
to
a
i
planned
to
penny
said
in
spite
of
what
pat
said
about
anybody
being
able
to
work
those
automatic
machines
but
there
just
aren
t
any
women
in
the
village
who
drive
their
own
cars
and
who
are
free
to
help
us
i
suppose
not
phil
said
this
man
a
taggart
penny
went
on
recently
moved
to
town
for
the
summer
and
needs
work
badly
he
offered
to
handle
our
laundry
for
us
at
a
flat
rate
of
only
fifteen
dollars
a
phil
whistled
say
that
cheap
he
added
teasingly
maybe
he
ll
take
the
first
batch
in
and
never
come
back
penny
laughed
he
s
already
taken
in
one
big
bundle
of
sheets
and
pillow
cases
and
according
to
ann
mary
brought
them
back
snowy
white
she
s
terribly
pleased
i
had
no
idea
we
could
get
anyone
to
do
it
so
cheaply
when
the
place
is
filled
with
guests
he
ll
probably
demand
more
money
but
let
s
not
object
kitty
says
the
laundry
problem
in
all
summer
hotels
is
usually
the
hardest
one
to
phil
nodded
if
the
place
really
fills
up
we
ll
not
only
have
to
raise
taggart
s
pay
but
we
ll
have
to
get
some
people
from
the
village
to
come
out
by
the
day
and
do
the
i
ve
thought
of
that
penny
said
the
same
girls
who
are
going
to
help
wait
on
the
tables
when
we
really
get
going
are
going
to
do
some
ironing
between
you
think
of
everything
phil
said
approvingly
i
m
proud
of
you
penny
sighed
you
shouldn
t
be
i
couldn
t
do
a
thing
without
the
advice
of
ann
mary
and
theresa
and
kitty
and
frankly
phil
i
m
getting
cold
feet
at
the
last
minute
what
if
the
whole
project
is
a
flop
it
won
t
be
phil
said
reassuringly
you
re
just
tired
and
getting
a
case
of
stage
he
tucked
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
led
her
toward
the
stairs
after
a
good
night
s
sleep
you
ll
be
your
old
irrepressible
self
again
full
of
vim
vigor
and
vitality
chapter
another
threat
on
the
door
who
can
that
be
penny
demanded
we
ve
simply
got
to
get
these
clean
curtains
up
before
the
first
guests
phil
who
was
helping
her
said
from
the
top
of
the
stepladder
probably
your
laundry
man
taggart
ann
mary
or
marjorie
can
take
care
of
he
climbed
down
the
ladder
now
what
draperies
penny
said
i
ve
already
put
in
the
pin
hooks
so
it
won
t
take
again
oh
dear
she
moaned
marjorie
and
ann
mary
are
probably
out
in
back
and
can
t
hear
everyone
else
is
in
the
village
that
s
someone
at
the
front
door
so
it
couldn
t
be
taggart
he
always
parks
his
car
by
the
donahues
cabin
i
d
better
run
down
and
see
who
s
phil
moved
his
ladder
to
the
window
where
the
draperies
were
to
be
hung
wait
a
minute
he
said
just
hand
me
up
those
things
and
then
he
stared
out
of
the
window
as
he
climbed
up
say
that
must
be
your
laundry
man
s
car
out
there
by
the
donahues
cabin
now
pretty
classy
isn
t
it
it
certainly
is
penny
agreed
hurriedly
she
gave
him
the
draperies
and
ran
down
the
stairs
from
the
balcony
at
the
bottom
she
stopped
someone
was
rummaging
around
in
the
storeroom
in
the
back
of
the
house
marjorie
she
called
rather
crossly
what
are
you
doing
in
there
this
is
no
time
to
explore
and
didn
t
you
hear
someone
knocking
on
the
front
door
she
hurried
down
the
hall
muttering
to
herself
with
all
i
have
to
do
it
seems
to
me
that
child
could
at
least
stop
looking
for
hidden
treasure
long
enough
to
answer
the
front
door
but
when
she
opened
the
door
penny
s
good
nature
was
immediately
restored
for
there
stood
judy
and
alf
powell
with
and
powell
right
behind
them
their
first
guests
had
arrived
penny
tried
to
hug
everyone
at
once
as
she
talked
excitedly
why
alf
you
ve
grown
like
a
beanstalk
jimmy
will
be
comparing
measurements
with
you
in
no
time
and
judy
you
haven
t
changed
a
bit
my
won
t
you
and
marjorie
have
a
million
things
to
talk
about
you
can
t
imagine
and
powell
how
pleased
we
were
that
you
could
come
this
isn
t
going
to
be
like
a
resort
at
all
we
re
going
to
be
surrounded
by
all
our
old
friends
isn
t
this
fine
come
right
in
how
did
you
get
here
have
you
a
car
to
put
away
penny
peered
around
but
could
not
see
a
car
any
place
no
penny
said
powell
we
decided
to
take
a
plane
alf
as
you
probably
know
has
flown
a
few
times
but
judy
had
never
been
we
flew
to
the
closest
airport
powell
added
and
took
a
bus
from
there
to
the
village
we
left
our
luggage
in
the
village
and
walked
out
it
s
such
a
beautiful
day
you
won
t
mind
sending
your
truck
down
for
our
bags
will
you
a
nice
man
in
the
village
told
us
you
had
of
course
not
said
marjorie
who
suddenly
appeared
behind
penny
in
the
hall
i
d
drive
it
myself
if
only
my
mean
old
brothers
and
sister
would
let
me
she
laughed
mischievously
imp
penny
cried
pushing
her
straight
into
judy
s
arms
as
the
two
girls
hugged
each
other
ecstatically
powell
said
to
penny
this
is
certainly
a
lovely
spot
even
your
description
didn
t
do
it
justice
i
know
we
re
all
going
to
have
a
wonderful
we
saw
the
lake
as
we
flew
over
powell
said
enthusiastically
and
it
looks
large
enough
to
hold
a
mighty
lot
of
there
s
enough
fish
there
to
feed
an
army
chimed
in
jimmy
as
he
came
running
in
from
the
driveway
where
he
had
parked
the
bronc
alf
and
i
are
going
to
catch
our
phil
came
down
the
stairs
from
the
balcony
and
greeted
everyone
cordially
you
couldn
t
have
arrived
at
a
better
time
he
told
his
guests
if
marjorie
had
had
to
wait
one
more
hour
for
judy
she
would
have
worn
a
path
from
the
back
door
to
the
front
ever
since
dawn
she
s
been
watching
for
your
and
yet
penny
said
with
a
laugh
when
they
did
arrive
she
didn
t
hear
them
knocking
on
the
i
was
busy
marjorie
informed
her
sister
airily
out
in
the
donahues
cabin
helping
ann
mary
get
their
laundry
together
for
penny
said
nothing
but
she
made
a
mental
note
to
scold
marjorie
later
in
private
marjorie
had
not
been
helping
ann
mary
penny
had
heard
her
rummaging
in
the
old
storage
room
there
s
something
a
lot
better
than
fish
around
here
jimmy
was
saying
in
an
undertone
to
alf
i
ll
say
there
is
marjorie
told
judy
penny
smiled
she
could
see
that
the
four
of
them
were
already
scheming
and
laying
plans
to
dig
up
the
entire
place
in
search
of
buried
treasure
i
guess
i
ll
forget
about
marjorie
s
little
white
lie
penny
decided
she
didn
t
mean
any
harm
and
i
know
she
s
been
dying
to
poke
around
in
those
old
trunks
for
jimmy
took
alf
to
his
room
and
marjorie
took
judy
to
hers
philip
and
penny
escorted
and
powell
to
the
big
airy
room
which
had
been
reserved
for
them
oh
judy
isn
t
it
that
you
are
here
marjorie
said
with
a
sigh
of
happiness
we
haven
t
got
everything
quite
arranged
yet
so
maybe
just
for
tonight
you
and
i
can
share
a
room
we
ll
stay
up
late
and
talk
and
raid
the
icebox
we
have
the
most
wonderful
things
to
eat
in
at
this
point
they
had
to
hug
each
other
and
dance
a
little
jig
in
the
ecstatic
joy
of
the
occasion
then
their
tongues
began
to
catch
up
with
all
there
was
to
tell
each
other
as
soon
as
mal
had
brought
the
powell
s
luggage
in
from
town
and
judy
had
changed
into
her
blue
jeans
she
and
marjorie
were
all
over
the
place
they
were
like
a
couple
of
hummingbirds
here
there
and
everywhere
they
took
a
dip
in
the
lake
a
shower
in
the
boathouse
and
afterwards
thoroughly
content
and
full
of
excess
spirits
they
dressed
for
the
best
dinner
that
judy
had
ever
tasted
marjorie
s
eyes
snapped
and
her
round
face
was
all
smiles
as
she
animatedly
told
the
powells
and
alf
what
she
and
judy
had
seen
and
done
then
alf
and
jimmy
related
how
they
had
spent
the
day
first
exploring
a
little
in
the
woods
then
making
plans
for
a
camping
trip
that
they
were
to
make
later
in
the
summer
and
finally
adding
a
little
to
the
construction
of
the
shack
they
were
mighty
anxious
to
complete
the
bachelors
retreat
as
fast
as
they
could
and
this
was
the
only
reason
why
they
accepted
an
offer
of
help
from
marjorie
and
judy
i
don
t
suppose
alf
said
giving
jimmy
a
nudge
that
they
ll
really
be
any
help
but
we
ll
let
them
sweep
up
wood
shavings
and
sort
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
kind
judy
said
briskly
i
m
going
to
put
up
a
wall
all
by
myself
or
i
won
t
go
near
your
silly
old
the
boys
hooted
and
ran
off
to
their
headquarters
but
not
much
work
was
accomplished
the
next
day
as
more
guests
arrived
brook
sanders
was
greeted
with
hilarious
shouts
of
joy
by
jimmy
and
alf
when
phil
brought
him
in
from
the
village
in
the
station
wagon
poor
brook
was
not
even
given
a
chance
to
go
to
his
room
but
his
parents
were
sure
he
preferred
going
down
to
see
the
shack
with
the
boys
he
came
back
with
a
glowing
description
of
the
woods
the
lake
the
picnic
grounds
the
shack
and
everything
else
he
had
seen
gee
dad
he
said
excitedly
i
wish
you
d
buy
the
place
next
door
jimmy
says
it
s
for
sanders
laughed
i
can
see
you
are
all
enthused
brook
but
why
buy
a
place
as
long
as
we
stand
in
with
the
allens
this
suits
me
too
said
brook
let
s
do
this
every
anybody
want
any
fudge
asked
marjorie
and
judy
we
ve
just
made
i
never
say
no
to
fudge
said
brook
picking
out
the
biggest
piece
before
alf
or
jimmy
could
get
it
you
d
better
leave
at
least
one
piece
for
me
alf
said
there
s
plenty
more
in
the
kitchen
said
judy
and
we
re
bringing
in
a
big
pitcher
of
lemonade
alf
went
into
the
kitchen
with
judy
to
carry
out
the
lemonade
and
marjorie
brought
in
another
dish
of
fudge
nut
fudge
gloated
alf
nuts
to
the
nutty
quoted
marjorie
from
one
of
her
brother
s
favorite
expressions
as
she
passed
him
the
dish
jimmy
alf
and
brook
spent
the
afternoon
out
in
the
motorboat
to
get
away
from
the
girls
and
to
make
their
plans
a
great
deal
had
happened
to
all
of
the
boys
since
they
had
last
seen
each
other
and
they
had
a
lot
of
catching
up
to
do
the
next
day
the
curtises
arrived
their
car
loaded
with
baggage
and
mary
said
there
was
more
coming
by
express
now
it
was
penny
s
and
philip
s
turn
to
get
all
excited
and
to
catch
up
on
old
times
with
mary
and
charles
charles
greeted
penny
in
his
old
devoted
manner
and
immediately
asked
if
peter
wyland
his
chief
competitor
had
arrived
yet
or
if
he
was
going
to
have
her
to
himself
this
summer
he
made
it
very
clear
that
even
if
peter
came
he
was
planning
to
absorb
all
of
penny
s
spare
time
penny
was
cordial
but
elusive
and
all
the
more
attractive
charles
did
not
enjoy
at
all
her
enthusiasm
over
the
different
members
of
his
party
he
felt
that
the
kiss
with
which
penny
greeted
mary
should
have
been
planted
on
his
cheek
instead
and
he
said
so
mary
and
phil
on
the
other
hand
acted
like
the
two
old
chums
that
they
were
they
both
laughed
heartily
when
charles
tried
to
kiss
penny
and
she
slipped
hastily
behind
phil
i
can
see
mary
said
that
we
re
going
to
have
a
grand
summer
watching
those
two
phil
chuckled
we
re
delighted
you
all
wanted
to
spend
the
summer
with
that
s
right
penny
said
making
a
face
at
charles
even
you
silly
i
wouldn
t
have
considered
the
summer
complete
unless
the
curtises
were
i
know
we
re
going
to
have
the
time
of
our
lives
mary
said
enthusiastically
i
hope
so
penny
said
we
ve
made
all
kinds
of
plans
we
ll
hike
through
the
woods
to
the
nearby
places
of
interest
and
have
picnics
and
all
sorts
of
evening
and
phil
added
to
charles
fish
and
the
yacht
penny
went
on
is
in
fine
shape
we
can
go
on
overnight
trips
on
the
lake
oh
she
finished
i
m
just
full
of
are
you
going
to
let
me
help
you
play
hostess
charles
asked
i
certainly
am
penny
told
him
briskly
and
for
pity
s
sake
start
right
in
with
all
that
baggage
i
m
sure
mal
will
be
floored
when
he
sees
it
but
all
charles
could
really
get
to
carry
up
was
one
small
bag
since
mal
pat
jimmy
and
the
other
two
boys
made
quick
work
of
getting
the
car
unloaded
penny
suspected
the
rush
act
was
put
on
because
they
were
all
anxious
to
drive
the
beautiful
shiny
cadillac
into
the
shed
for
the
next
few
days
the
lodge
was
a
beehive
of
activity
there
was
much
conversation
and
laughter
and
a
great
deal
of
coming
and
going
about
the
grounds
there
were
beach
parties
hikes
and
picnics
and
an
impromptu
evening
party
with
everybody
joining
wholeheartedly
in
all
the
games
that
were
suggested
jimmy
arranged
a
snipe
phil
was
the
only
other
person
besides
jimmy
who
knew
there
were
no
snipe
around
there
everybody
started
out
at
twilight
with
flashlights
and
paper
bags
to
hunt
for
the
elusive
snipe
and
when
they
all
came
back
one
by
one
jimmy
greeted
them
with
a
big
stuffed
bird
in
his
hands
brook
said
it
was
an
old
logger
s
trick
and
everybody
in
new
england
knew
about
it
but
he
couldn
t
understand
how
he
and
all
these
other
people
would
fall
for
it
nevertheless
they
had
all
enjoyed
their
tramp
through
the
woods
and
the
snack
that
awaited
them
when
they
returned
there
was
little
rest
for
the
allens
now
penny
would
slip
away
when
everybody
was
being
entertained
to
make
out
orders
and
menus
she
also
found
that
she
would
have
to
make
arrangements
for
some
of
the
village
people
to
come
in
and
help
with
the
cleaning
as
well
as
the
ironing
and
serving
when
more
guests
arrived
things
were
really
getting
down
to
quite
a
businesslike
basis
however
and
penny
was
pleased
with
the
routine
they
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
partly
by
plan
and
partly
by
accident
they
had
planned
to
try
and
get
all
of
their
actual
work
done
in
the
morning
but
the
first
few
days
it
had
not
worked
out
that
way
since
most
of
the
guests
were
up
bright
and
early
but
after
a
few
days
when
the
novelty
of
the
lodge
had
worn
off
and
their
guests
had
become
quite
settled
most
of
them
slept
later
and
this
gave
the
allens
time
for
their
work
penny
and
phil
both
had
a
disappointment
in
common
when
peter
wyland
and
adra
wrote
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
come
to
the
lodge
until
the
first
week
in
august
adra
prentice
was
spending
some
time
with
her
father
whom
she
had
hardly
seen
all
winter
and
since
prentice
could
not
come
to
the
lodge
at
all
as
he
had
originally
planned
adra
had
decided
to
spend
july
with
him
and
then
come
to
the
lodge
for
august
peter
of
course
was
in
prentice
s
employ
and
so
he
could
not
come
for
the
same
reason
however
they
both
wrote
in
their
letters
to
phil
and
penny
that
they
would
be
there
in
august
and
peter
hinted
that
he
might
be
able
to
come
a
week
earlier
it
s
a
good
thing
we
haven
t
much
time
to
miss
anyone
these
days
phil
said
and
penny
smiled
yes
keeping
busy
is
a
wonderful
antidote
for
some
things
she
said
the
next
few
weeks
were
indeed
busy
ones
some
friends
of
mary
curtis
arrived
and
a
few
friends
of
charles
dropped
in
for
the
weekends
marjorie
and
judy
were
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
new
romances
among
the
young
folks
and
just
as
they
were
certain
that
one
was
developing
something
would
happen
which
would
prove
that
they
were
wrong
anyway
marjorie
said
to
judy
there
are
two
romances
we
can
be
absolutely
sure
of
phil
is
in
love
with
adra
and
penny
is
mad
about
and
judy
chimed
in
adra
is
in
love
with
phil
and
peter
is
wild
about
penny
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if
they
were
all
engaged
before
the
end
of
the
neither
would
i
marjorie
said
her
blue
eyes
twinkling
phil
and
penny
can
hardly
wait
for
the
arrival
of
adra
and
they
had
been
helping
theresa
by
emptying
all
of
the
scrap
baskets
from
the
various
rooms
in
the
lodge
into
the
big
wire
mesh
one
in
the
clearing
later
when
the
wind
died
down
pat
would
set
a
match
to
the
papers
right
now
the
wind
was
blowing
so
hard
that
it
lifted
a
crumpled
ball
of
paper
from
judy
s
hand
and
blew
it
smack
against
marjorie
s
face
fate
marjorie
said
with
a
giggle
obviously
meant
for
me
to
read
this
before
it
got
assuming
an
exaggeratedly
serious
air
she
smoothed
out
the
paper
on
her
knee
then
she
gave
a
little
gasp
oh
judy
she
cried
it
s
another
anonymous
letter
remember
i
told
you
about
the
one
phil
got
this
one
was
sent
to
penny
and
i
ll
bet
she
crumpled
it
up
and
threw
it
away
without
saying
anything
to
judy
nodded
penny
s
like
that
she
wouldn
t
pay
any
attention
to
a
letter
she
got
unless
it
was
signed
what
does
this
one
say
one
marjorie
stammered
after
reading
it
quickly
and
she
read
the
crudely
printed
words
out
loud
miss
allen
your
fall
the
other
day
was
not
an
accident
i
purposely
weakened
those
boards
in
the
shed
so
that
the
first
one
of
you
who
leaned
on
them
would
crash
into
the
well
if
you
don
t
clear
out
of
the
lodge
soon
expect
worse
i
warned
you
that
i
mean
business
judy
sniffed
well
it
doesn
t
frighten
me
from
the
way
you
described
penny
s
accident
i
m
sure
it
didn
t
happen
because
someone
had
tampered
with
the
wall
of
the
shed
even
if
he
had
weakened
the
boards
how
could
he
be
sure
someone
was
going
to
lean
on
them
you
re
right
marjorie
admitted
completely
over
her
nervousness
penny
herself
said
she
was
foolish
to
touch
that
broken
she
crumpled
the
letter
and
tossed
it
into
the
mesh
basket
a
crazy
person
who
heard
about
penny
s
fall
wrote
that
silly
letter
come
on
let
s
bring
the
empty
baskets
back
to
theresa
and
forget
the
whole
but
deep
down
inside
marjorie
was
thinking
about
the
footprint
jimmy
had
discovered
in
the
dirt
under
the
shed
floor
had
it
been
left
there
before
penny
s
accident
or
after
it
after
it
she
finally
decided
the
floor
boards
were
all
in
place
the
first
time
we
inspected
the
shed
the
man
who
came
snooping
around
that
night
must
have
left
that
footprint
he
probably
meant
to
sneak
back
and
cover
up
the
hole
he
made
in
the
floor
but
got
frightened
away
for
good
when
phil
and
pat
fired
those
shots
in
the
chapter
clues
in
a
bottle
all
during
the
hot
july
days
that
followed
judy
and
marjorie
did
indeed
live
in
bathing
suits
powell
and
penny
tried
to
make
them
dress
up
for
dinner
but
they
compromised
by
changing
into
clean
shirts
and
blue
jeans
aren
t
we
ever
going
to
do
anything
about
the
treasure
that
s
supposed
to
be
buried
around
here
judy
asked
one
day
they
had
been
in
swimming
and
were
now
lying
in
the
sun
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
i
suppose
we
should
do
something
about
it
marjorie
said
lazily
but
it
s
been
so
hot
i
hate
the
thought
of
digging
helping
pat
hoe
up
his
potatoes
was
about
all
i
could
i
ve
still
got
some
blisters
judy
said
with
a
grin
marjorie
raised
herself
on
one
elbow
and
squinted
up
toward
the
lodge
penny
and
phil
don
t
think
there
s
any
treasure
buried
around
here
any
more
than
there
was
a
ghost
haunting
the
i
know
don
t
judy
said
but
jimmy
alf
and
brook
do
they
ve
been
acting
very
mysteriously
ever
since
we
got
here
they
sneak
off
early
in
the
morning
with
shovels
and
things
and
i
m
sure
they
don
t
spend
all
their
time
fixing
up
their
i
know
marjorie
said
thoughtfully
and
it
would
be
simply
awful
if
the
boys
found
the
treasure
not
she
scrambled
to
her
feet
we
ve
got
to
find
it
first
let
s
get
out
of
these
wet
bathing
suits
before
we
do
anything
else
while
we
re
changing
into
dungarees
we
can
decide
where
the
best
place
to
start
digging
ten
minutes
later
the
girls
left
the
lodge
by
the
back
door
and
armed
with
shovels
went
down
to
the
clearing
oh
golly
marjorie
moaned
i
thought
this
would
be
a
swell
place
to
dig
because
there
s
no
grass
on
the
ground
here
but
just
look
there
s
the
wash
hanging
out
on
the
line
to
dry
taggart
must
have
just
brought
it
back
from
the
just
our
luck
judy
complained
we
d
better
not
dig
anywhere
near
it
we
d
be
sure
to
raise
clouds
of
dust
it
hasn
t
rained
in
i
tell
you
what
let
s
do
instead
marjorie
suggested
let
s
go
help
the
boys
with
their
shack
they
promised
to
let
us
work
on
it
too
once
it
s
finished
maybe
they
ll
go
off
on
that
camping
trip
with
pat
then
we
ll
have
the
whole
place
to
that
s
right
judy
agreed
if
they
caught
us
digging
they
d
be
sure
to
make
fun
of
us
they
pretend
that
we
re
silly
to
believe
that
there
s
treasure
buried
around
here
but
i
happen
to
know
that
they
believe
in
it
when
they
arrived
at
the
shack
the
girls
offer
of
help
was
promptly
turned
down
alf
hooted
judy
you
don
t
know
which
end
of
a
hammer
is
the
neither
does
marjorie
added
jimmy
with
a
teasing
grin
scram
you
two
we
men
have
work
to
but
you
promised
marjorie
reminded
him
crossly
jimmy
waved
her
away
later
child
later
right
now
we
re
too
busy
to
teach
you
the
rudiments
of
so
judy
and
marjorie
wandered
forlornly
off
and
returned
to
the
clearing
where
they
had
left
their
shovels
after
that
they
spent
a
few
hours
every
day
aimlessly
digging
here
and
there
for
buried
treasure
but
it
was
tiresome
work
and
since
they
knew
the
holes
had
to
be
filled
up
they
never
dug
very
deep
or
very
long
at
any
one
spot
this
is
hopeless
judy
said
one
day
toward
the
end
of
july
what
we
ought
to
look
for
are
clues
maps
and
things
pirates
may
have
left
around
which
will
tell
us
exactly
where
to
i
don
t
think
there
were
ever
any
pirates
around
here
marjorie
said
dubiously
didn
t
they
always
stick
pretty
close
to
the
seacoasts
i
guess
you
re
right
judy
said
disconsolately
but
whoever
buried
the
treasure
should
have
left
some
clues
or
not
necessarily
marjorie
pointed
out
practically
he
might
have
buried
it
in
a
hurry
and
then
the
indians
or
somebody
might
have
killed
him
right
i
give
judy
flung
her
shovel
on
the
ground
the
boys
can
find
the
treasure
first
for
all
i
care
my
hands
are
so
sore
i
couldn
t
paddle
a
canoe
so
let
s
go
all
right
marjorie
agreed
i
do
want
you
to
have
fun
while
you
re
our
guest
judy
she
added
worriedly
oh
i
am
judy
assured
her
with
a
quick
smile
it
was
my
idea
to
dig
for
the
treasure
not
yours
but
let
s
forget
about
it
for
let
s
marjorie
agreed
besides
i
haven
t
been
much
of
a
help
to
penny
lately
i
m
supposed
to
be
assistant
hostess
you
know
and
help
her
entertain
the
well
i
m
a
guest
judy
said
with
a
giggle
and
you
ve
entertained
me
from
then
on
marjorie
spent
more
time
helping
penny
and
ann
mary
and
theresa
by
the
first
of
august
the
boys
had
made
great
progress
with
the
shack
mal
pat
and
phil
helped
out
whenever
they
could
and
some
of
the
guests
pitched
in
occasionally
the
walls
and
the
roof
were
now
up
the
doors
and
windows
were
in
place
and
the
boys
had
even
spent
two
nights
sleeping
there
on
cots
they
were
now
putting
in
the
finishing
touches
and
true
to
their
promise
they
had
let
marjorie
and
judy
help
marjorie
in
her
enthusiasm
over
being
allowed
to
put
up
a
shower
wall
all
by
herself
had
banged
her
finger
with
the
hammer
and
the
boys
had
suggested
that
she
and
judy
take
some
time
off
to
recuperate
so
marjorie
and
judy
were
looking
for
shells
down
on
the
beach
oh
golly
judy
said
in
disgust
after
awhile
all
the
nice
ones
seem
to
get
as
far
under
the
rocks
as
they
they
certainly
do
marjorie
agreed
but
let
s
keep
looking
we
might
find
some
really
valuable
ones
which
we
could
sell
to
collectors
for
a
lot
of
for
the
next
few
minutes
they
were
very
busy
pushing
and
shoving
at
the
rocks
upturning
some
and
giving
up
others
that
were
too
heavy
to
budge
finally
they
came
across
one
huge
stone
that
seemed
to
be
imbedded
in
the
sand
marjorie
knew
that
even
with
judy
s
help
she
couldn
t
move
it
and
she
was
just
about
to
crawl
by
it
when
she
saw
something
judy
she
cried
excitedly
come
here
quickly
doesn
t
it
look
as
though
someone
had
been
digging
around
this
rock
a
little
while
ago
judy
scrambled
to
her
feet
and
joined
marjorie
you
re
right
she
said
some
one
been
digging
here
i
ll
bet
whoever
it
was
buried
something
under
that
she
flopped
down
on
her
knees
beside
marjorie
and
together
the
girls
began
to
dig
frantically
with
their
fingers
and
then
marjorie
s
sharp
eyes
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
that
glittered
in
the
sunlight
diamonds
she
gasped
judy
help
me
let
s
see
if
we
can
t
inch
the
rock
up
a
little
so
we
can
see
better
oh
wouldn
t
it
be
wonderful
if
there
was
real
treasure
buried
here
judy
tugging
at
the
heavy
rock
could
only
pant
there
now
we
ve
got
it
they
both
fell
to
digging
with
renewed
vigor
and
in
another
second
marjorie
could
see
that
the
glittering
object
was
only
a
dark
green
glass
bottle
oh
for
pete
s
sake
she
moaned
disappointedly
and
i
thought
we
were
at
last
going
to
find
the
buried
crossly
she
yanked
the
bottle
out
of
the
warm
sand
and
raised
her
arm
to
toss
it
into
the
lake
wait
a
minute
cried
judy
grabbing
her
arm
just
in
time
there
s
something
in
that
bottle
marjorie
when
you
held
it
up
in
the
sunlight
i
could
see
right
through
the
dark
green
marjorie
held
the
bottle
up
again
and
stared
at
it
you
re
right
judy
she
said
it
looks
like
a
piece
of
paper
oh
golly
maybe
it
s
a
map
which
ll
tell
us
exactly
where
the
treasure
is
buried
as
she
talked
marjorie
was
prying
out
the
cork
with
a
piece
of
broken
shell
hurry
hurry
judy
cried
impatiently
hopping
up
and
down
now
you
ve
got
it
out
at
last
turn
it
upside
down
and
shake
it
marjorie
oh
oh
it
a
piece
of
paper
the
piece
of
paper
was
battered
and
torn
and
it
had
been
crumpled
into
a
small
ball
carefully
marjorie
smoothed
it
out
and
together
they
tried
to
read
the
smudged
words
after
half
an
hour
of
intensive
studying
they
were
able
to
figure
out
that
the
scrap
was
a
fragment
of
a
message
and
the
message
had
something
to
do
with
the
log
cabin
and
a
well
oh
judy
marjorie
gasped
the
well
must
be
the
one
we
dug
up
if
we
could
only
find
the
other
fragment
i
ll
bet
the
two
together
would
tell
us
where
the
treasure
is
buried
who
do
you
suppose
wrote
the
message
judy
asked
wonderingly
and
how
did
it
get
torn
and
how
did
one
half
get
into
this
bottle
i
can
guess
what
happened
marjorie
said
her
imagination
completely
running
away
with
her
two
men
knew
about
the
buried
treasure
near
the
old
well
they
wrote
down
just
where
they
were
supposed
to
dig
then
they
got
into
a
fight
when
they
talked
about
how
they
were
going
to
divide
the
loot
in
the
tussle
one
man
got
off
with
one
half
and
the
other
put
his
half
in
this
bottle
and
buried
it
here
for
judy
stared
at
her
in
admiration
you
re
wonderful
marjorie
she
said
that
s
just
what
happened
now
all
we
have
to
do
is
find
the
other
marjorie
s
elfin
blue
eyes
were
bright
with
suppressed
laughter
she
demanded
sarcastically
the
other
half
of
the
message
could
be
anywhere
in
the
she
stared
thoughtfully
down
at
the
scrap
the
two
letters
tr
might
be
part
of
the
word
what
do
you
think
judy
i
think
you
re
absolutely
right
judy
said
emphatically
aren
t
there
some
old
trunks
in
the
storeroom
that
you
haven
t
opened
yet
oh
marjorie
do
you
suppose
there
s
another
clue
in
one
of
them
let
s
look
anyway
marjorie
said
tuesday
when
i
was
helping
ann
mary
get
the
soiled
linen
ready
for
taggart
to
take
into
town
i
asked
her
if
you
and
i
couldn
t
go
through
those
old
trunks
some
rainy
day
and
she
said
we
could
she
laughed
at
me
and
said
you
won
t
find
any
treasure
there
if
you
re
smart
you
ll
search
for
rare
shells
down
by
the
that
s
how
i
got
the
idea
of
trying
to
find
some
which
rich
collectors
might
buy
from
well
judy
said
we
didn
t
find
any
worth
bringing
back
to
the
lodge
let
s
don
t
waste
any
more
time
looking
for
rare
shells
let
s
go
show
this
clue
to
the
marjorie
hesitated
okay
but
i
ll
bet
they
just
make
fun
of
us
jimmy
won
t
even
consider
that
it
just
might
be
a
but
judy
objected
he
s
bound
to
realize
that
the
message
had
something
to
do
with
the
well
and
the
lodge
let
s
marjorie
carefully
tucked
the
torn
paper
into
the
pocket
of
her
blue
jeans
then
they
raced
back
to
the
lodge
out
in
the
shed
the
girls
found
that
jimmy
alf
and
brook
had
finished
closing
in
the
shower
they
banged
on
the
door
and
jimmy
called
out
in
a
dramatic
voice
who
invades
our
privacy
this
is
the
bachelors
retreat
and
we
want
no
women
around
here
marjorie
heard
him
add
in
a
loud
whisper
and
especially
not
dimwit
girls
she
yelled
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
oh
come
on
out
jimmy
quit
being
so
mean
to
us
we
have
something
important
to
show
but
jimmy
was
adamant
quit
banging
on
the
door
dopes
we
ll
open
it
when
we
re
ready
and
not
a
minute
marjorie
turned
to
judy
try
alf
he
s
your
alf
powell
judy
screamed
you
ll
be
sorry
if
you
don
t
come
right
out
what
we
have
is
something
really
yummy
she
added
quietly
to
marjorie
that
ll
get
him
yummy
they
heard
both
alf
and
brook
repeat
and
then
from
jimmy
as
he
opened
the
door
and
stuck
his
head
out
why
didn
t
you
say
you
had
food
in
the
first
place
look
said
marjorie
showing
him
the
piece
of
paper
judy
and
i
found
this
in
a
bottle
buried
in
the
sand
under
a
big
rock
on
the
beach
we
think
it
s
part
of
a
message
that
has
something
to
do
with
the
buried
oh
you
dopey
kids
jimmy
said
in
a
very
condescending
tone
of
voice
your
imagination
works
overtime
it
s
fantastic
he
said
over
his
shoulder
to
alf
and
brook
what
they
can
think
up
in
their
spare
but
jimmy
took
the
paper
from
marjorie
and
gave
it
a
contemptuous
glance
what
a
mess
he
said
you
know
perfectly
well
you
rigged
this
up
yourselves
but
you
can
t
fool
we
didn
t
honest
marjorie
said
tossing
her
blonde
head
but
if
that
s
the
way
you
feel
about
it
give
it
back
to
me
furthermore
if
we
find
any
more
clues
you
ll
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
we
jimmy
tossed
it
to
her
with
a
grin
run
along
kids
we
haven
t
time
for
your
monkey
business
we
re
going
for
a
swim
and
then
we
re
going
to
get
the
bronc
ready
for
our
camping
he
slammed
the
door
in
marjorie
s
face
scram
later
if
we
men
haven
t
anything
better
to
do
you
can
try
to
fool
us
with
your
phony
see
marjorie
bitterly
asked
judy
that
s
a
brother
for
you
if
we
do
find
anything
in
the
storage
room
let
s
not
tell
a
soul
chapter
the
map
marjorie
and
judy
entered
the
lodge
by
the
back
door
and
found
taggart
in
the
kitchen
with
a
big
bundle
of
clean
laundry
hello
girls
he
said
pleasantly
find
any
buried
treasure
yet
no
judy
replied
but
down
on
the
beach
we
marjorie
nudged
her
and
said
quickly
we
found
a
lot
of
absolutely
worthless
she
grinned
at
ann
mary
who
came
into
the
kitchen
then
with
a
bag
of
soiled
linen
you
and
your
rare
specimens
i
ll
bet
you
sent
us
off
on
that
wild
goose
chase
just
to
get
us
out
of
your
ann
mary
laughed
maybe
i
she
turned
to
taggart
i
really
sent
them
down
to
the
lake
to
keep
them
from
digging
up
the
whole
place
pat
and
mal
worked
hard
on
the
vegetable
garden
behind
the
cabin
and
i
m
not
going
to
have
the
kids
ruin
it
in
their
search
for
something
which
they
know
perfectly
well
isn
t
that
s
right
the
laundry
man
said
with
a
grin
a
carrot
in
the
hand
is
worth
a
diamond
in
the
he
picked
up
the
bag
and
started
for
the
door
wait
a
minute
please
ann
mary
said
there
s
more
upstairs
sit
down
and
make
yourself
comfortable
while
i
gather
up
the
bed
do
you
want
me
to
do
it
for
you
ann
mary
marjorie
asked
hoping
the
answer
would
be
no
thank
you
no
ann
mary
said
emphatically
the
last
time
you
counted
the
sheets
you
counted
one
of
them
marjorie
giggled
and
the
girls
followed
ann
mary
out
into
the
hall
as
she
hurried
up
the
stairs
to
the
balcony
judy
said
i
wish
you
d
show
me
the
secret
room
sometime
marjorie
i
think
you
re
mean
to
keep
it
a
secret
from
me
your
very
best
why
of
course
i
ll
show
it
to
you
marjorie
cried
impulsively
and
there
s
no
time
like
the
she
led
the
way
into
the
alcove
and
said
see
those
bookshelves
now
watch
while
i
press
this
with
amazement
judy
watched
as
the
shelves
moved
aside
revealing
a
short
flight
of
stairs
that
led
down
into
a
little
room
why
that
s
the
most
marvelous
contraption
i
ever
saw
she
said
enviously
i
wish
we
had
something
like
it
at
we
can
t
go
in
marjorie
said
it
s
a
law
we
passed
at
a
meeting
of
the
allen
lodge
board
of
directors
only
phil
and
pat
can
go
in
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
added
thoughtfully
i
guess
i
shouldn
t
have
showed
you
how
the
door
works
without
first
asking
their
i
won
t
tell
a
soul
judy
promised
but
why
all
the
secrecy
well
marjorie
explained
we
keep
all
the
guests
valuables
and
all
the
money
in
that
little
old
wall
safe
in
she
stopped
suddenly
oh
gosh
i
guess
that
was
ann
mary
who
just
went
by
the
alcove
she
must
have
heard
us
talking
in
here
and
now
she
ll
guess
that
i
showed
you
the
secret
will
she
tell
phil
and
penny
judy
asked
worriedly
and
will
they
bawl
you
out
oh
i
hope
not
it
was
all
my
fault
curiosity
killed
the
cat
she
finished
lamely
you
mean
marjorie
said
as
she
closed
the
door
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
she
grinned
no
ann
mary
won
t
tell
if
she
thinks
i
did
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
she
ll
bawl
me
out
herself
but
she
s
no
and
neither
is
pat
they
re
both
grand
people
and
so
are
the
everyone
at
the
lodge
is
swell
judy
agreed
and
added
cautiously
since
we
re
probably
already
in
dutch
don
t
you
think
maybe
we
d
better
ask
penny
s
permission
before
we
go
through
those
old
trunks
in
the
storeroom
i
know
ann
mary
said
we
could
but
after
all
penny
is
the
housekeeper
isn
t
she
marjorie
nodded
we
ll
get
her
permission
right
she
glanced
at
her
wristwatch
she
s
probably
out
on
the
porch
having
tea
with
your
parents
and
and
curtis
and
i
guess
and
sanders
i
tell
you
what
let
s
do
judy
said
let
s
put
on
a
fashion
show
didn
t
you
say
that
the
trunk
you
ve
already
opened
is
full
of
dresses
and
costume
jewelry
what
a
wonderful
idea
marjorie
raced
ahead
of
judy
down
the
spacious
hall
to
the
porch
penny
looking
very
lovely
in
a
pale
yellow
afternoon
frock
looked
up
from
the
tea
table
with
a
smile
having
fun
girls
she
asked
i
don
t
have
to
ask
you
if
you
re
hungry
help
yourselves
to
sandwiches
and
we
re
not
hungry
for
once
penny
marjorie
told
her
with
a
laugh
we
came
out
to
ask
you
if
it
s
all
right
if
we
put
on
a
fashion
show
for
you
while
you
re
having
tea
the
boys
have
deserted
us
and
judy
and
i
want
to
dress
up
and
parade
around
in
some
of
the
old
costumes
in
the
storage
go
right
ahead
penny
said
that
s
the
best
idea
you
ve
had
all
summer
she
turned
to
mary
curtis
who
was
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
don
t
you
think
so
too
mary
mary
nodded
anything
to
keep
those
two
out
of
marjorie
and
judy
hurried
away
to
the
storage
room
my
why
haven
t
we
poked
around
in
here
before
judy
asked
marjorie
what
s
in
all
those
boxes
and
trunks
anyway
i
only
know
what
s
in
the
trunk
we
already
opened
marjorie
told
her
these
are
the
old
old
she
pointed
to
two
little
trunks
standing
side
by
side
after
the
fashion
show
we
ll
go
through
them
carefully
for
clues
the
other
boxes
all
contain
things
of
ours
that
we
ve
put
away
so
we
wouldn
t
clutter
up
the
house
with
things
we
didn
t
half
an
hour
later
the
girls
appeared
on
the
porch
and
marched
sedately
up
and
down
hoping
they
were
behaving
like
professional
models
it
was
all
penny
could
do
to
keep
from
laughing
to
her
they
looked
as
stiff
as
wooden
puppets
in
a
punch
and
judy
show
what
period
are
you
representing
brook
s
mother
asked
suppressing
a
smile
jane
austen
marjorie
relaxed
enough
to
shrug
we
haven
t
the
faintest
idea
sanders
let
s
pretend
that
the
audience
has
to
all
right
sanders
agreed
i
ll
stick
to
and
i
d
say
that
the
black
velvet
was
of
the
nineties
after
the
big
sleeves
and
hideous
bustles
had
gone
out
powell
said
curtis
thought
it
was
of
a
later
period
she
laughed
and
said
wouldn
t
it
be
funny
if
those
bustles
came
back
in
again
i
m
afraid
they
wouldn
t
look
quite
as
cute
on
us
as
they
do
on
those
two
young
ladies
mary
told
them
she
thought
the
blue
satin
dress
was
meant
to
be
worn
with
hoops
and
was
probably
from
a
period
dating
near
the
civil
war
let
s
go
see
if
we
can
find
the
hoop
marjorie
said
taking
judy
by
the
hand
and
heading
back
to
the
storeroom
they
had
had
enough
of
dressing
up
by
this
time
and
they
got
back
into
their
blue
jeans
and
proceeded
to
turn
the
contents
of
the
trunks
inside
out
they
felt
every
part
of
the
inside
of
the
trunks
for
hidden
places
they
shook
all
the
clothes
carefully
and
examined
them
minutely
but
all
to
no
avail
maybe
all
of
the
costume
jewelry
in
that
box
isn
t
set
with
imitation
stones
judy
said
without
much
hope
but
it
is
marjorie
said
do
you
want
to
look
at
it
she
impatiently
yanked
off
the
lid
and
the
old
velvet
lining
fell
away
then
they
both
saw
it
an
old
map
pasted
inside
the
cover
marjorie
was
so
surprised
she
sat
right
down
on
the
storage
room
floor
oh
my
goodness
she
finally
got
out
to
think
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
we
might
not
have
even
opened
the
jewelry
box
i
never
would
have
thought
of
looking
here
because
i
examined
it
so
carefully
when
phil
and
penny
first
opened
this
but
judy
wasn
t
listening
she
had
hurried
to
a
window
with
the
lid
and
was
examining
the
map
carefully
marjorie
she
groaned
this
is
positively
the
worst
thing
that
ever
happened
to
us
marjorie
scrambled
to
her
feet
and
hurried
to
peer
over
judy
s
shoulder
in
another
minute
she
too
was
groaning
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
she
mumbled
sadly
this
map
tells
exactly
where
the
treasure
is
buried
and
where
it
is
buried
is
right
under
the
potato
hills
in
pat
s
garden
that
s
the
way
it
looks
to
me
judy
said
mournfully
he
won
t
dig
up
those
potatoes
until
the
fall
the
vines
have
hardly
begun
to
very
near
to
tears
she
added
and
and
you
ll
find
the
treasure
after
i
ve
gone
back
to
school
just
then
penny
appeared
at
the
door
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
you
two
she
asked
i
could
hear
your
moans
and
groans
from
the
we
ve
found
the
map
that
shows
exactly
where
the
treasure
is
buried
marjorie
wailed
pat
won
t
let
us
dig
it
penny
s
blue
eyes
were
dark
with
surprise
don
t
be
silly
marjorie
she
said
of
course
pat
will
let
you
dig
it
marjorie
hurried
across
the
room
to
show
penny
the
map
see
she
said
pointing
the
big
x
is
behind
the
donahues
cabin
on
the
west
side
judy
and
i
know
what
s
planted
there
we
got
blisters
on
our
hands
the
day
we
helped
pat
and
mal
hoe
up
those
potato
hills
penny
glanced
at
the
map
and
then
she
laughed
you
silly
girls
don
t
you
know
that
this
is
a
joke
the
boys
played
on
you
she
went
back
into
the
hall
and
called
up
the
stairs
jimmy
come
down
here
right
away
jimmy
took
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
what
s
up
he
demanded
the
house
on
fire
for
answer
penny
handed
him
the
jewelry
box
lid
didn
t
you
paste
that
map
there
to
play
a
joke
on
the
girls
jimmy
stared
at
the
map
in
amazement
honestly
penny
he
said
soberly
i
never
saw
the
darn
thing
how
about
alf
and
brook
penny
asked
sternly
a
joke
s
a
joke
but
this
one
might
have
caused
serious
trouble
if
someone
not
as
thoughtful
as
marjorie
had
found
it
and
followed
directions
he
would
have
ruined
pat
s
i
know
jimmy
said
still
staring
at
the
map
but
neither
alf
nor
brook
did
it
penny
they
ve
never
been
inside
the
storage
room
so
they
couldn
t
possibly
have
planted
this
map
in
the
cover
of
the
costume
jewelry
well
then
penny
said
firmly
the
person
who
did
did
it
purposely
to
annoy
i
don
t
know
how
you
can
be
so
sure
of
that
marjorie
objected
think
someone
put
it
in
the
lid
long
before
pat
and
mal
planted
the
penny
gave
her
a
fond
pat
i
hate
to
disillusion
you
honey
but
the
map
was
pasted
in
the
lid
quite
recently
last
week
when
i
opened
the
box
to
show
mary
the
costume
jewelry
the
old
velvet
lining
fell
out
and
there
wasn
t
any
map
there
marjorie
sighed
with
disappointment
oh
dear
she
began
then
i
suppose
the
same
mean
person
put
that
scrap
of
paper
in
the
bot
but
she
never
finished
what
she
had
planned
to
say
for
just
then
phil
called
out
excitedly
from
the
porch
penny
peter
s
here
chapter
peter
is
worried
peter
had
arrived
several
days
earlier
than
he
had
planned
for
a
moment
penny
stood
stock
still
on
the
threshold
of
the
old
storage
room
she
was
too
thrilled
to
move
but
she
was
very
glad
that
she
was
wearing
her
most
becoming
afternoon
frock
peter
said
that
pale
yellow
brought
out
the
golden
lights
in
her
hair
and
turned
her
eyes
to
violets
or
was
it
marjorie
s
giggle
set
her
in
motion
wake
up
penny
marjorie
said
with
a
laugh
this
is
no
time
to
her
cheeks
burning
penny
hurried
down
the
hall
peter
wyland
was
just
getting
out
of
his
car
when
she
appeared
on
the
porch
penny
s
heart
beat
a
little
faster
as
she
greeted
him
cordially
and
tried
to
look
as
casual
as
possible
peter
squeezed
her
hand
lingeringly
and
looked
as
though
he
were
going
to
kiss
her
right
in
front
of
all
the
people
you
re
looking
wonderful
penny
said
so
are
you
peter
s
eyes
admired
her
smooth
skin
which
the
summer
sun
had
turned
to
a
golden
tan
neither
of
them
could
think
of
another
word
to
say
and
yet
they
had
so
much
to
say
to
each
other
philip
came
to
the
rescue
with
a
cheery
grin
hi
fella
he
greeted
peter
shaking
his
hand
as
though
it
were
a
pump
handle
good
to
see
you
charles
came
running
down
the
front
steps
to
greet
peter
enthusiastically
too
penny
thought
good
old
charles
he
can
be
nice
when
he
wants
to
if
it
weren
t
for
peter
i
think
i
could
like
charles
a
she
glanced
shyly
at
peter
oh
he
love
me
i
can
tell
penny
was
in
a
whirl
the
first
thing
philip
wanted
to
know
was
when
adra
prentice
was
coming
you
re
in
luck
boy
peter
said
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
she
s
arriving
in
a
couple
of
hours
by
plane
her
dad
my
boss
is
planning
to
spend
a
week
here
toward
the
end
of
the
phil
s
eyes
lighted
up
with
anticipation
this
would
be
the
most
exciting
day
of
the
whole
summer
for
penny
and
phil
i
ll
carry
your
bags
up
to
your
room
he
said
to
peter
no
i
don
t
need
any
help
i
know
penny
is
dying
to
show
you
all
over
the
lodge
and
the
marjorie
watched
them
stroll
off
together
arm
in
arm
she
was
glad
peter
was
here
and
that
adra
was
coming
soon
but
she
did
so
want
to
be
alone
with
penny
for
a
few
minutes
sometime
that
day
we
ve
got
to
show
her
the
clue
we
found
in
the
bottle
down
on
the
beach
she
said
to
judy
maybe
the
map
is
a
phony
but
i
m
sure
the
scrap
of
paper
in
my
pocket
means
i
am
too
judy
agreed
and
i
m
not
so
sure
that
the
map
is
a
phony
it
looked
so
old
and
somebody
might
have
found
it
just
the
other
day
and
put
it
in
the
jewelry
box
lid
for
marjorie
stared
at
her
thoughtfully
who
do
you
suppose
this
somebody
is
who
is
lurking
around
here
and
writing
anonymous
letters
it
must
be
the
same
person
but
how
did
he
get
into
the
storage
room
without
being
seen
judy
shrugged
don
t
ask
me
let
s
talk
it
all
over
with
penny
the
first
chance
we
get
then
she
can
discuss
it
with
peter
he
s
sort
of
an
amateur
detective
isn
t
he
marjorie
nodded
heaven
knows
when
we
ll
be
able
to
say
more
than
two
words
to
adra
arrived
just
before
dinner
and
once
again
there
was
excitement
and
tumult
jimmy
and
marjorie
greeted
the
lovely
girl
with
shouts
of
welcome
penny
hugged
her
affectionately
but
philip
could
only
hold
her
hand
in
his
and
stare
down
at
her
wordlessly
but
the
expression
on
his
handsome
face
told
adra
more
than
anything
he
could
have
said
penny
s
duties
as
hostess
and
housekeeper
kept
her
busy
until
late
in
the
evening
at
last
when
she
was
alone
in
the
office
planning
the
next
day
s
program
marjorie
and
judy
could
stand
it
no
longer
they
burst
into
the
room
and
marjorie
blurted
we
ve
been
trying
to
see
you
alone
all
evening
sis
but
golly
you
re
busy
as
she
stuck
her
hand
in
her
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
worn
scrap
of
paper
judy
and
i
found
this
in
a
bottle
buried
under
a
big
rock
down
on
the
penny
frowned
tiredly
oh
marjorie
not
another
one
of
your
clues
marjorie
bit
her
lip
i
know
you
think
we
re
silly
to
keep
looking
for
buried
treasure
penny
but
this
is
part
of
a
message
and
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
log
cabin
and
a
penny
laid
the
scrap
on
her
desk
and
tried
to
read
it
the
girls
showed
her
what
they
had
been
able
to
decipher
oh
dear
penny
said
i
m
too
tired
now
to
think
about
clues
i
m
sorry
girls
go
on
to
bed
now
it
s
late
leave
this
with
me
and
the
first
chance
i
get
in
the
morning
i
ll
show
it
to
peter
he
s
the
detective
of
our
group
and
if
anyone
can
figure
what
this
is
all
about
it
s
after
the
girls
had
gone
up
to
their
rooms
penny
added
to
herself
i
m
glad
peter
arrived
today
for
more
reasons
than
one
something
mysterious
going
on
who
was
our
prowler
who
wrote
those
anonymous
letters
who
put
the
map
in
the
lid
of
the
old
jewelry
box
and
what
sense
does
this
scrap
of
paper
make
the
next
morning
right
after
breakfast
she
was
asking
peter
the
same
questions
he
listened
attentively
as
she
filled
in
all
the
details
when
she
had
finished
he
said
very
seriously
i
don
t
like
any
part
of
this
penny
especially
the
letter
that
threatened
you
frankly
i
wish
you
had
turned
it
over
to
the
police
even
if
there
were
only
latent
fingerprints
on
it
they
could
have
sent
it
to
the
fbi
in
washington
those
experts
don
t
miss
a
thing
and
if
the
man
is
a
criminal
his
fingerprints
will
be
in
their
but
penny
objected
if
he
a
criminal
he
would
have
been
smart
enough
to
wear
that
s
true
peter
admitted
but
there
are
other
ways
of
discovering
who
wrote
those
letters
for
one
thing
although
he
undoubtedly
did
his
best
to
disguise
his
handwriting
he
couldn
t
completely
no
one
can
we
all
develop
certain
characteristics
when
we
first
learn
to
write
and
those
characteristics
stay
with
us
my
penny
said
admiringly
you
a
detective
peter
grinned
and
then
sobered
not
really
penny
and
i
wish
you
d
let
me
notify
the
police
now
someone
is
obviously
very
interested
in
making
you
allens
clear
out
of
here
i
don
t
know
why
but
i
can
so
can
i
penny
said
twirling
a
strand
of
her
light
brown
hair
around
her
finger
maybe
jimmy
and
marjorie
are
right
after
all
maybe
there
buried
treasure
around
peter
stared
down
at
the
note
on
the
desk
they
had
managed
to
make
out
the
following
words
t
the
log
cabin
t
week
in
august
asure
again
near
the
r
a
well
that
dry
the
first
word
in
the
third
line
penny
said
could
be
the
last
part
of
the
word
and
the
well
could
be
the
one
we
dug
up
but
our
mysterious
x
isn
t
as
smart
as
he
should
be
we
went
clear
to
the
bottom
of
that
old
well
peter
and
there
just
isn
t
any
buried
treasure
peter
nodded
the
man
first
tried
to
frighten
you
and
now
he
s
being
as
annoying
as
he
do
you
know
what
i
think
penny
asked
i
think
there
is
something
valuable
hidden
around
here
which
we
don
t
know
anything
about
but
x
does
he
wants
us
to
keep
on
thinking
it
s
buried
somewhere
on
the
grounds
so
we
ll
keep
on
digging
instead
of
searching
elsewhere
for
you
re
not
only
very
pretty
penny
peter
said
smiling
but
you
re
very
intelligent
i
think
you
ve
reasoned
it
out
correctly
the
map
and
this
fragment
of
paper
are
red
herrings
not
clues
will
you
let
me
turn
them
over
to
the
police
just
the
paper
our
x
used
may
be
a
clue
which
would
lead
to
the
discovery
of
his
identity
in
a
very
short
oh
no
peter
penny
cried
impulsively
let
s
not
turn
the
mystery
over
to
the
police
now
let
s
first
try
to
solve
it
ourselves
besides
she
added
shrewdly
when
they
hear
about
the
night
prowler
who
attacked
mal
they
may
want
to
put
guards
around
the
lodge
and
that
peter
wyland
would
make
some
of
the
guests
nervous
it
might
ruin
our
whole
business
i
can
refuse
you
nothing
penny
allen
he
said
grinning
but
i
think
we
ought
to
consult
with
phil
and
adra
before
we
make
a
final
decision
let
s
call
them
in
and
hash
the
whole
thing
out
all
over
but
an
hour
later
after
a
serious
discussion
penny
won
they
would
not
notify
the
police
unless
they
received
another
threatening
letter
i
still
don
t
like
it
peter
grumbled
the
idea
of
that
coward
threatening
penny
blushed
peter
was
being
very
protective
about
her
and
she
couldn
t
help
liking
it
but
he
didn
t
really
threaten
me
she
pointed
out
he
couldn
t
possibly
have
known
i
was
going
to
touch
the
rotten
supports
in
the
shed
wall
if
you
ask
me
he
heard
about
the
accident
and
simply
took
advantage
of
it
a
few
hours
after
i
tumbled
down
the
well
everyone
in
the
village
knew
about
that
s
another
thing
peter
said
stubbornly
if
we
notify
the
police
they
ll
know
who
is
a
stranger
in
town
and
keep
an
eye
on
penny
laughed
then
they
d
have
to
have
a
thousand
eyes
peter
the
place
is
swarming
with
summer
peter
threw
up
his
hands
in
mock
despair
oh
all
right
he
said
i
give
in
let
s
forget
about
it
for
awhile
how
about
a
swim
penny
or
are
you
too
busy
well
penny
began
i
skip
it
sis
phil
interrupted
pleasure
comes
before
business
since
your
main
duty
is
to
see
that
your
guests
are
the
meeting
broke
up
then
and
everyone
hurried
off
to
change
into
bathing
suits
down
on
dock
they
found
marjorie
and
judy
sitting
on
the
edge
dangling
their
feet
in
the
water
jimmy
alf
and
brook
were
busy
completing
preparations
for
their
camping
trip
which
was
to
start
the
next
day
the
boys
were
fixing
two
of
the
canoes
to
take
along
on
the
bronc
they
were
planning
to
do
some
fishing
in
the
rivers
they
camped
by
and
were
going
to
be
fully
prepared
to
take
advantage
of
anything
else
they
might
find
that
evening
they
had
an
square
dance
out
on
the
front
porch
there
was
a
fiddler
in
the
town
who
had
come
back
with
mal
and
the
guests
as
well
as
the
allens
had
a
lively
time
kitty
and
ann
mary
served
delicious
cold
lemonade
with
homemade
cookies
philip
reached
for
his
fourth
cooky
and
said
to
adra
i
m
sure
i
d
get
too
fat
to
move
if
i
ate
all
the
good
things
ann
mary
is
always
making
can
you
make
cookies
like
this
adra
she
laughed
and
said
no
phil
i
can
t
make
anything
as
good
as
ann
mary
does
but
i
m
sure
i
could
learn
if
i
was
offered
an
would
i
be
incentive
enough
asked
phil
you
would
indeed
said
adra
promptly
but
i
m
afraid
we
couldn
t
live
on
just
phil
laughed
and
said
that
might
be
fun
for
a
little
while
i
m
sure
marjorie
and
jimmy
would
think
so
they
can
eat
at
least
two
dozen
at
a
time
without
even
trying
i
m
so
glad
you
re
going
to
be
here
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
adra
we
have
so
much
to
talk
about
i
want
to
tell
you
of
my
plans
for
the
winter
i
m
going
to
try
to
take
a
job
where
i
can
be
near

be
wonderful
cried
adra
i
can
t
think
of
anything
i
would
like
better
you
know
peter
and
i
have
become
very
good
friends
since
he
has
been
working
for
my
father
and
he
told
me
he
would
like
to
find
something
so
that
he
could
be
closer
to
penny
does
penny
know
how
much
he
likes
her
i
think
she
does
adra
because
you
see
she
likes
peter
just
as
phil
and
adra
looked
very
happy
as
they
strolled
off
hand
in
hand
penny
watching
them
said
to
peter
i
m
glad
our
mysterious
x
isn
t
spoiling
their
fun
i
wish
you
d
forget
about
the
mystery
too
peter
just
for
the
evening
she
added
wistfully
he
grinned
cheerfully
when
i
look
at
you
penny
i
can
t
even
remember
my
own
but
penny
knew
that
underneath
his
flattering
banter
peter
was
worried
she
almost
wished
that
she
hadn
t
told
him
anything
about
the
mystery
chapter
camping
out
the
next
day
everybody
came
out
to
wish
bon
voyage
to
pat
and
the
boys
who
were
leaving
on
their
camping
trip
for
a
week
all
hands
helped
them
get
their
paraphernalia
aboard
the
station
wagon
pat
was
the
last
one
to
get
in
with
the
big
box
of
fishing
tackle
in
his
left
hand
and
a
huge
picnic
hamper
packed
with
good
food
in
his
right
hand
ann
mary
had
seen
to
it
that
they
would
eat
well
the
first
day
they
started
out
for
the
rest
of
the
week
they
had
the
back
of
the
bronc
well
stocked
with
canned
foods
which
they
expected
to
supplement
with
the
fish
they
caught
they
were
all
in
the
best
of
spirits
this
was
to
be
a
real
adventure
pat
was
taking
them
into
the
woods
to
a
fishing
camp
where
jimmy
s
uncle
john
allen
used
to
go
every
summer
alf
powell
and
jimmy
were
the
chief
mechanics
in
case
anything
went
wrong
with
the
car
and
brook
and
pat
were
to
be
the
cooks
marjorie
and
judy
had
their
noses
slightly
out
of
joint
because
they
had
been
hoping
right
up
until
the
last
minute
before
the
boys
left
that
perhaps
they
too
would
be
allowed
to
go
along
but
the
boys
would
not
even
hear
of
it
and
penny
thought
it
would
not
be
a
good
idea
either
never
mind
judy
said
in
a
consoling
whisper
to
marjorie
maybe
we
ll
find
the
buried
treasure
while
they
re
just
then
ann
mary
came
running
out
with
an
armful
of
freshly
ironed
shirts
for
the
boys
mr
taggart
brought
these
she
panted
early
this
morning
i
told
him
he
had
to
get
them
here
before
you
left
theresa
just
finished
ironing
thanks
jimmy
said
but
they
needn
t
have
been
ironed
for
the
next
week
we
aren
t
going
to
care
how
we
lucky
dogs
marjorie
said
in
an
aside
to
judy
do
you
know
what
penny
said
to
me
last
night
she
said
from
now
on
you
and
i
ought
to
change
before
dinner
into
something
besides
blue
i
guess
she
s
right
judy
said
reluctantly
mother
has
had
the
same
idea
all
but
in
spite
of
how
they
felt
the
girls
recovered
from
their
sulks
long
enough
to
wave
cheery
goodbyes
to
the
boys
have
fun
they
shouted
be
careful
called
penny
and
so
at
last
jimmy
alf
and
brook
were
off
on
their
great
adventure
after
driving
all
day
pat
and
the
boys
pulled
into
a
little
grove
of
pines
deep
in
the
woods
near
a
beautiful
river
they
made
camp
and
got
out
their
mosquito
repellent
pat
had
told
them
the
black
flies
in
this
part
of
the
woods
were
really
vicious
so
they
had
come
well
prepared
for
such
an
emergency
jimmy
and
alf
got
into
their
high
boots
and
waded
into
the
river
to
fish
the
results
of
this
little
expedition
were
not
quite
as
good
as
they
expected
but
the
few
small
fish
they
caught
were
very
sweet
when
cooked
they
were
up
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
but
that
day
brought
no
better
results
as
far
as
fishing
was
concerned
pat
suggested
that
they
move
camp
deeper
into
the
woods
near
a
little
lake
where
he
thought
the
fishing
would
be
much
better
jimmy
seconded
the
suggestion
and
in
no
time
at
all
they
were
on
their
way
again
this
time
they
made
camp
near
the
tip
of
the
little
lake
and
early
the
next
morning
they
watched
the
mist
rise
from
the
lake
and
listened
to
the
birds
singing
in
chorus
this
spot
was
so
beautiful
that
brook
and
alf
said
they
would
like
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
week
here
even
if
they
didn
t
catch
a
single
fish
i
knew
you
d
like
it
answered
pat
mr
allen
always
wanted
to
stay
here
awhile
he
said
to
jimmy
and
no
wonder
said
jimmy
i
can
t
wait
until
we
get
out
there
in
our
the
boys
were
all
skillful
with
the
paddle
and
as
they
skimmed
along
the
lake
widened
then
narrowed
till
it
was
not
much
more
than
a
stream
finally
they
reached
the
other
end
and
drew
the
canoe
into
a
small
bay
pat
led
them
to
a
small
log
hut
hidden
in
the
nearby
trees
here
there
was
a
curious
storehouse
for
food
and
extra
equipment
it
was
built
of
small
pine
logs
and
was
raised
high
on
a
few
posts
pat
explained
that
this
was
to
keep
the
food
from
getting
damp
and
that
if
it
were
properly
fastened
no
climbing
bear
could
help
himself
to
the
food
the
little
bay
where
they
had
left
their
canoe
was
the
outlet
for
a
stream
in
which
pat
said
there
was
wonderful
fishing
pat
said
they
would
have
to
go
upstream
a
way
against
some
rapids
to
get
to
the
really
good
fishing
spot
he
also
told
them
that
there
was
a
waterfall
nearby
and
the
safest
thing
would
be
for
all
of
them
to
do
all
of
their
exploring
fishing
hunting
or
anything
else
they
decided
to
do
in
groups
pat
cautioned
them
about
the
strong
current
in
the
stream
too
come
on
said
jimmy
let
s
do
some
fishing
now
and
go
up
those
rapids
they
caught
a
beautiful
trout
and
a
bass
for
their
supper
and
considered
that
a
perfect
end
to
a
successful
and
happy
day
they
decided
to
spend
the
night
in
the
small
log
campers
hut
the
next
day
s
plan
was
changed
when
morning
came
the
woods
about
the
camp
were
explored
and
found
to
be
fairly
open
it
was
full
of
birds
squirrels
chipmunks
and
other
small
animals
brook
almost
caught
a
flying
squirrel
and
claimed
that
he
saw
a
wild
cat
there
were
beavers
building
in
a
small
stream
that
wandered
through
the
pines
and
widened
not
far
from
the
lake
a
graceful
deer
took
flight
as
pat
who
was
in
the
lead
approached
this
caused
considerable
excitement
and
all
chatter
ceased
as
they
stole
on
in
the
hope
of
surprising
another
deer
or
a
bear
they
climbed
trees
investigated
nests
and
jimmy
kept
looking
for
bees
the
boys
wanted
to
know
why
and
he
replied
that
the
bees
would
lead
them
to
a
honey
tree
and
there
they
might
find
a
bear
go
to
it
jimmy
cried
alf
i
bet
we
take
the
honey
they
finally
did
see
a
bear
a
black
one
of
moderate
size
it
ambled
off
before
them
from
the
water
s
edge
none
of
them
had
the
heart
to
shoot
it
or
anything
else
they
saw
they
were
having
such
a
wonderful
time
just
investigating
around
the
campfire
that
night
they
sang
and
told
stories
and
when
it
began
to
turn
very
chilly
they
turned
in
they
were
awakened
early
in
the
morning
by
the
bird
chorus
alf
said
it
was
not
so
hard
to
get
up
here
as
at
home
in
school
time
they
took
the
canoe
up
the
rocky
stream
with
its
dashing
waters
and
strong
current
by
noon
they
had
reached
the
highest
point
from
which
these
rapids
started
it
was
quiet
at
noon
and
the
sun
was
hot
the
perspiring
boys
sat
around
in
their
bathing
shorts
and
ate
a
cold
lunch
then
they
got
down
to
the
real
business
of
fishing
jimmy
drew
in
a
handsome
black
bass
and
then
the
competition
became
keen
brook
caught
a
beautiful
brook
trout
and
it
was
a
jolly
group
of
boys
that
sat
near
the
shore
to
clean
their
fish
in
the
late
afternoon
when
they
had
returned
to
the
hut
jimmy
had
started
the
fire
and
then
joined
the
rest
picking
up
the
first
fish
at
hand
a
fine
trout
who
caught
this
he
asked
i
ll
have
you
know
that
i
m
the
guy
grinned
pat
looking
up
from
the
bass
he
was
cleaning
and
waving
his
knife
in
the
air
it
s
fishing
where
there
s
something
to
catch
isn
t
this
a
walleyed
perch
jimmy
asked
brook
i
guess
jimmy
had
started
in
vigorously
to
clean
the
trout
and
now
raised
a
loud
voice
in
the
ditty
of
ham
and
the
others
joined
in
making
the
shore
ring
with
the
sound
the
fact
that
supper
was
to
consist
mainly
of
fish
made
no
difference
with
young
appetites
and
overflowing
energy
they
managed
to
consume
all
of
the
day
s
catch
the
next
day
jimmy
and
alf
wanted
to
take
things
easy
and
do
some
swimming
and
lounging
but
brook
wanted
to
do
some
more
exploring
they
finally
decided
to
spend
the
day
near
the
hut
and
brook
made
a
mental
note
to
do
some
exploring
on
his
own
when
he
could
while
they
were
all
in
swimming
he
paddled
off
alone
down
the
main
stream
he
had
gone
only
a
little
distance
before
he
was
concealed
from
view
by
trees
and
a
curving
shore
he
entered
the
main
stream
which
was
quite
wide
as
far
as
the
fork
there
the
division
of
waters
left
the
wider
stream
to
the
right
but
that
to
brook
s
left
offered
the
prettier
outlook
it
stretched
almost
straight
before
him
to
some
distance
and
descended
in
a
little
rapids
these
looked
easy
he
thought
and
though
there
were
rocks
the
water
looked
shallow
enough
for
a
good
swimmer
not
to
be
troubled
with
any
difficulty
about
reaching
shore
or
a
rock
in
case
the
canoe
upset
a
little
peninsula
dotted
with
green
trees
and
bushes
jutted
out
from
the
left
shore
brook
thought
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
someone
moving
there
and
started
into
the
left
fork
of
the
stream
after
all
he
reflected
as
the
crow
flies
i
m
only
a
couple
of
miles
from
camp
maybe
jimmy
and
alf
have
been
out
exploring
and
are
over
there
on
the
then
he
saw
something
that
made
him
paddle
faster
than
ever
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
dashing
waters
further
on
but
he
was
too
excited
to
pay
any
attention
to
it
what
he
had
glimpsed
looked
like
a
human
body
sprawling
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
bushes
of
a
cove
on
the
point
brook
nosed
his
canoe
into
the
cove
beached
it
and
climbed
up
the
gentle
incline
then
he
saw
that
what
had
attracted
his
attention
was
only
an
old
tattered
coat
it
was
and
had
obviously
been
flung
over
a
rock
to
dry
but
from
the
stream
it
had
looked
like
the
torso
of
a
human
body
well
brook
sighed
with
relief
thank
goodness
no
one
was
hurt
or
he
went
into
the
brush
past
a
few
spruces
and
found
a
small
clearing
in
the
mud
here
were
footprints
which
had
obviously
been
made
very
recently
it
had
rained
the
night
before
clearing
just
before
dawn
sometime
between
then
and
now
someone
had
walked
across
the
clearing
and
into
the
brush
and
back
again
into
the
woods
on
the
other
side
of
the
clearing
brook
reflected
as
he
studied
the
footprints
whoever
it
was
might
have
hung
his
coat
on
the
rock
to
dry
if
he
had
been
caught
in
the
early
morning
rainstorm
probably
a
tramp
he
decided
and
went
back
to
the
coat
he
lifted
it
rather
gingerly
and
then
because
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
turned
its
pockets
inside
out
to
his
surprise
he
found
in
the
last
pocket
a
letter
it
looked
as
though
it
had
been
soaked
by
the
rain
and
had
been
dried
again
by
the
sun
which
had
been
shining
upon
the
coat
and
rock
all
morning
the
address
upon
the
torn
envelope
was
blurred
and
brook
s
curiosity
was
hindered
by
the
fact
that
it
was
almost
lunch
time
and
it
might
be
well
to
hurry
back
sticking
the
letter
into
the
waterproof
zippered
pocket
of
his
bathing
trunks
he
hurried
to
his
canoe
pushed
out
and
entered
the
stream
again
as
brook
got
back
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
he
suddenly
discovered
that
no
paddling
was
necessary
to
make
his
canoe
go
the
descent
which
looked
so
gradual
drew
canoe
and
the
water
itself
down
rapidly
the
current
was
much
stronger
than
one
would
have
thought
brook
used
his
paddle
skillfully
he
was
enjoying
this
exhilarating
experience
it
was
great
but
when
he
tried
to
skim
around
a
few
rocks
to
the
point
he
almost
upset
the
canoe
and
only
by
a
quick
push
from
a
rock
did
he
avoid
being
thrown
out
but
the
canoe
righted
and
brook
sped
on
past
the
peninsula
around
into
a
wider
channel
for
which
brook
was
at
first
glad
there
was
more
space
between
rocks
but
the
current
was
stronger
his
control
over
the
canoe
was
getting
a
little
out
of
hand
brook
was
just
beginning
to
realize
that
he
had
had
no
business
coming
off
by
himself
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
falls
his
face
grew
pale
but
he
set
his
lips
the
current
drew
the
canoe
out
into
a
wider
part
of
the
river
and
when
brook
looked
ahead
for
a
minute
he
could
see
a
white
spray
dashing
high
over
a
pile
of
obstructing
rocks
it
did
not
seem
so
bad
off
to
the
right
and
brook
tried
to
edge
over
in
that
direction
but
what
he
saw
ahead
of
him
made
him
sick
it
was
still
some
distance
away
but
the
water
was
boiling
over
at
a
little
curve
and
fell
somewhere
below
he
could
not
tell
where
chapter
jimmy
to
the
rescue
back
at
camp
shortly
after
brook
paddled
off
by
himself
jimmy
and
alf
decided
that
they
had
had
enough
swimming
for
one
day
race
you
to
shore
jimmy
yelled
flailing
the
water
in
a
fast
crawl
alf
was
slightly
ahead
of
him
but
jimmy
soon
passed
him
and
was
the
first
to
throw
himself
on
the
beach
crowing
breathlessly
beat
you
by
a
mere
inch
alf
said
flopping
down
beside
him
where
s
brook
jimmy
shrugged
probably
back
in
the
hut
helping
pat
prepare
a
feast
for
our
lunch
that
guy
s
always
so
am
i
alf
said
it
s
your
michigan
air
but
i
don
t
think
brook
is
with
pat
i
saw
him
drag
one
of
the
canoes
into
the
water
just
before
our
race
i
was
too
busy
trying
to
keep
up
with
you
to
see
what
he
did
after
what
difference
does
it
make
jimmy
demanded
let
s
go
exploring
by
canoe
ourselves
we
can
dry
off
in
the
sun
just
in
time
for
he
pointed
i
want
to
investigate
that
fork
of
the
first
stream
over
i
want
to
eat
alf
said
i
m
starving
but
if
you
must
satisfy
your
curiosity
before
i
satisfy
my
hunger
i
suppose
you
i
can
t
let
you
eat
now
anyway
jimmy
said
with
a
grin
if
i
did
there
wouldn
t
be
anything
left
for
brook
when
he
shows
i
ll
say
there
wouldn
t
alf
agreed
tightening
the
belt
on
his
trunks
i
could
catch
a
fish
right
now
with
my
bare
hands
and
eat
it
while
it
s
still
you
just
had
breakfast
jimmy
said
come
on
alf
lazily
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
squinted
up
at
the
sky
about
four
hours
ago
by
the
sun
he
said
stubbornly
jimmy
yanked
him
to
his
feet
and
called
out
to
pat
we
re
going
canoeing
back
in
time
for
okay
came
pat
s
voice
from
inside
the
cabin
you
bet
we
ll
be
back
for
lunch
alf
said
as
he
and
jimmy
glided
out
upon
the
lake
what
s
the
coil
of
rope
doing
in
the
canoe
i
brought
it
along
so
we
could
climb
a
bee
tree
if
we
found
one
laughed
jimmy
anyhow
it
belongs
to
pat
i
think
it
s
some
of
theresa
s
the
boys
turned
into
the
stream
and
when
they
came
to
the
forking
of
the
water
they
entered
the
narrower
stream
toward
its
right
shore
where
the
waters
seemed
quieter
while
alf
paddled
jimmy
made
a
loop
of
the
rope
and
tossed
it
toward
a
stout
little
spruce
this
comes
in
handy
said
jimmy
as
the
rope
caught
and
alf
paddled
in
close
to
the
shore
this
current
is
certainly
strong
he
added
soberly
and
i
imagine
if
we
got
caught
in
the
center
we
d
be
headed
for
the
are
there
falls
near
here
alf
asked
i
think
so
don
t
you
hear
them
alf
agreed
and
they
discussed
jimmy
s
plan
of
either
drawing
the
canoe
ashore
and
footing
it
down
or
easing
the
canoe
along
the
right
shore
but
there
was
a
tangle
of
underbrush
along
the
bank
and
the
footing
was
uneasy
they
decided
to
risk
it
because
they
had
the
rope
to
throw
out
to
some
tree
so
they
could
keep
out
of
the
current
they
kept
very
close
to
the
shore
and
before
they
reached
the
peninsula
they
beached
the
canoe
in
a
curve
that
was
almost
a
pool
and
hastened
over
sticks
and
brush
and
stones
to
see
what
lay
farther
down
well
we
were
smart
to
land
jimmy
said
alf
as
they
stood
looking
at
the
stream
where
it
flowed
beyond
the
little
peninsula
but
it
certainly
is
pretty
we
ll
have
to
watch
our
step
getting
down
where
we
can
see
the
falls
doesn
t
she
foam
where
she
is
going
over
do
you
imagine
the
falls
are
high
can
t
tell
alf
jimmy
said
looks
like
quite
a
ravine
down
ahead
but
this
whole
region
isn
t
very
high
and
it
probably
dams
up
into
some
other
little
lake
come
wait
till
i
go
back
after
the
rope
jim
said
alf
we
may
need
it
if
we
climb
down
by
the
alf
picked
his
way
back
the
short
distance
to
the
canoe
and
brought
the
rope
they
followed
the
curving
shore
toward
the
left
where
the
waters
that
swept
past
the
point
went
wildly
on
in
the
wider
channel
to
fall
over
somewhere
jimmy
with
the
rope
over
his
shoulder
stood
still
alf
thought
it
might
be
better
to
strike
through
the
trees
and
avoid
the
rocks
on
the
edge
jimmy
surveyed
the
water
at
his
feet
the
scattered
rocks
washed
by
the
current
and
looked
upstream
just
in
time
to
see
brook
s
face
as
brook
saw
the
falls
ahead
alf
jimmy
yelled
horrified
look
there
it
s
brook
only
a
moment
did
jimmy
stare
he
slipped
the
loop
already
made
over
his
head
and
tightened
it
about
his
waist
alf
needed
no
directions
what
they
had
to
do
must
be
done
quickly
they
both
started
running
to
a
point
that
would
bring
them
nearer
to
brook
s
course
brook
brook
they
kept
shouting
this
way
brook
did
not
hear
them
but
just
at
that
moment
his
pale
face
turned
toward
the
boys
and
he
saw
them
this
way
this
way
cried
jimmy
beckoning
if
brook
could
only
get
out
of
that
awful
central
current
but
maybe
it
was
all
current
he
can
t
come
this
way
i
ve
got
to
throw
him
an
end
of
the
as
jimmy
spoke
he
was
busy
tying
a
stone
on
the
end
of
the
rope
to
weight
it
what
a
risk
it
was
jimmy
was
wading
out
to
a
great
rock
in
a
shallow
where
the
shore
curved
this
was
no
game
he
must
not
miss
alf
waded
after
jimmy
to
help
him
hold
on
to
the
rope
there
was
still
a
good
chance
if
they
were
successful
to
rescue
brook
it
was
some
distance
to
the
falls
but
now
the
canoe
brook
was
in
seemed
to
be
coming
faster
now
jimmy
threw
and
jimmy
had
not
played
ball
for
nothing
brook
did
not
catch
the
rope
but
weighted
by
the
stone
it
fell
into
the
canoe
and
brook
grasped
it
before
it
could
slip
back
now
his
paddle
was
whirling
out
of
sight
brook
was
standing
up
in
the
canoe
with
the
rope
tied
around
him
ready
to
jump
alf
braced
himself
and
jimmy
held
the
rope
tightly
just
in
front
of
where
it
was
around
him
and
drew
it
taut
as
brook
leaped
the
rope
drew
in
easily
at
first
then
came
the
tug
against
the
current
jimmy
leaned
against
the
rock
to
brace
himself
it
was
all
over
in
a
few
anxious
moments
brook
had
bruised
himself
among
the
rocks
but
he
swam
crept
upon
a
rock
leaped
to
another
found
himself
in
quieter
waters
and
was
helped
to
his
feet
by
two
boys
who
could
scarcely
speak
how
did
you
get
here
gasped
brook
as
they
helped
him
ashore
that
s
the
question
we
would
like
to
ask
you
answered
jimmy
after
a
brief
silence
during
which
they
examined
brook
to
see
if
he
had
any
broken
bones
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
brook
said
shamefacedly
i
i
m
awfully
sorry
jimmy
i
hope
the
canoe
will
come
through
all
right
but
i
don
t
see
how
it
can
i
ll
make
it
good
jimmy
i
promise
we
ll
see
about
that
later
returned
jimmy
the
point
is
are
you
all
right
i
guess
so
brook
said
sheepishly
got
some
bruised
shins
i
think
it
didn
t
do
me
any
i
ll
say
not
jimmy
grinned
a
little
and
took
brook
s
arms
working
them
up
and
down
one
after
another
swallow
any
water
brook
was
glad
of
that
grin
and
he
sheepishly
grinned
back
my
arms
are
all
right
only
sore
i
ll
be
black
and
blue
from
that
rock
i
hit
first
but
i
guess
i
deserve
sure
you
do
jimmy
said
with
a
chuckle
and
to
think
i
thought
you
were
at
the
hut
with
pat
gosh
are
we
ever
lucky
i
guess
none
of
us
listened
too
carefully
when
pat
told
us
to
be
sure
not
to
go
off
by
ourselves
we
re
guilty
of
the
same
thing
you
are
brook
he
admitted
well
this
has
been
a
lesson
we
ll
never
forget
and
i
would
say
we
ve
gotten
off
pretty
cheaply
if
it
just
cost
us
the
canoe
let
s
get
back
to
pat
right
away
and
tell
him
we
re
all
alf
and
jimmy
helped
brook
who
was
white
and
wretched
after
his
narrow
escape
and
when
they
got
to
their
canoe
they
made
rapidly
for
camp
go
limp
brook
said
jimmy
and
tell
us
all
about
brook
grinned
and
said
he
was
limp
all
right
and
briefly
told
how
he
had
tried
to
explore
the
little
rapids
that
looked
so
easy
completely
forgetting
that
there
were
falls
in
the
vicinity
he
also
related
the
incident
of
the
coat
and
pulled
out
a
wet
wad
from
his
pocket
i
was
going
to
dry
this
said
he
and
see
if
i
couldn
t
read
a
little
of
it
maybe
i
might
as
well
throw
it
maybe
we
can
dry
it
yet
suggested
alf
interested
perhaps
it
s
a
map
to
a
perhaps
it
isn
t
laughed
jimmy
but
he
caught
brook
s
hand
as
he
was
about
to
toss
the
letter
overboard
wait
it
s
still
pretty
flat
in
the
envelope
we
ll
dry
it
out
and
see
how
long
were
you
there
when
you
found
this
oh
about
ten
minutes
or
well
that
ten
minutes
saved
your
life
kid
jimmy
grinned
alf
and
i
must
have
left
right
after
you
did
and
passed
you
i
wonder
if
you
would
have
made
it
over
the
falls
if
we
hadn
t
come
along
i
d
like
to
go
down
later
and
see
what
it
looks
like
over
the
brink
so
would
i
jimmy
brook
said
jimmy
snorted
you
re
going
to
lie
around
this
afternoon
brook
after
we
fix
you
back
at
camp
they
found
that
pat
was
just
beginning
to
get
worried
he
had
kept
their
lunch
warm
for
them
and
looked
rather
cross
as
they
beached
the
canoe
then
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
brook
s
white
face
well
out
with
it
pat
said
frowning
what
happened
to
you
lad
you
look
like
a
drowned
i
m
worse
than
that
brook
said
ruefully
i
m
battered
and
bruised
as
they
all
explained
what
had
happened
interrupting
each
other
constantly
pat
carefully
examined
brook
to
make
sure
he
was
not
badly
hurt
just
a
strained
ligament
he
said
smiling
reassuringly
we
ll
have
that
shoulder
strapped
up
in
no
he
went
into
the
hut
for
his
first
aid
kit
and
soon
brook
was
eating
as
hungrily
as
the
other
boys
but
after
lunch
he
didn
t
argue
when
pat
said
now
lad
you
re
to
take
it
easy
the
rest
of
the
the
next
morning
brook
reported
that
outside
of
a
few
bruises
he
felt
fine
then
they
all
went
back
to
see
the
falls
they
re
pretty
brook
said
musingly
and
rocky
but
not
very
high
after
a
deep
pool
lay
below
and
there
was
the
canoe
bobbing
around
aimlessly
near
the
edge
of
the
pool
it
had
a
big
gash
in
its
side
but
was
not
beyond
repair
jimmy
reported
he
towed
it
up
on
the
shore
with
the
aid
of
the
trusty
rope
and
a
hook
they
made
with
some
wire
maybe
i
could
have
swum
out
brook
ventured
but
i
m
certainly
glad
i
didn
t
have
to
try
it
and
most
of
all
pat
i
m
glad
you
didn
t
make
much
of
my
disobedience
of
your
order
believe
me
it
won
t
happen
i
know
said
pat
forget
it
it
merely
was
a
bit
more
excitement
on
a
very
pleasant
after
their
return
from
the
falls
brook
remembered
the
dilapidated
letter
and
got
it
out
everyone
gathered
round
him
and
they
all
tried
to
read
it
it
was
badly
torn
obviously
a
good
part
of
it
was
missing
and
what
little
was
left
was
hardly
discernible
they
managed
to
make
out
the
words
and
suddenly
jimmy
s
face
lighted
up
say
do
you
remember
last
week
the
day
we
finished
the
shower
marjorie
showed
me
a
scrap
of
paper
she
said
she
and
judy
had
found
in
a
bottle
on
the
beach
alf
nodded
so
what
they
didn
t
find
it
in
any
old
bottle
they
manufactured
the
whole
story
just
to
kid
that
s
what
i
thought
jimmy
said
rather
shamefacedly
but
now
i
think
differently
this
piece
looks
as
though
it
had
been
torn
from
the
scrap
they
holy
cow
brook
stared
at
him
and
the
girls
couldn
t
have
followed
us
and
planted
this
part
of
it
in
the
pocket
of
that
old
of
course
not
jimmy
said
grinning
although
if
either
of
them
could
drive
a
car
i
wouldn
t
have
put
it
past
them
besides
you
said
the
footprints
you
saw
leading
to
and
from
the
coat
were
made
by
a
man
s
jimmy
stopped
suddenly
footprints
he
repeated
say
brook
can
we
get
to
the
place
where
you
found
the
coat
by
walking
sure
brook
said
it
would
take
twice
as
long
as
it
would
in
a
canoe
but
he
added
ruefully
it
would
be
twice
as
then
let
s
go
jimmy
yelled
i
want
to
have
a
look
at
the
footprints
you
found
in
the
he
turned
to
pat
okay
if
we
go
pat
nodded
as
long
as
you
all
stick
together
this
as
they
hurried
through
the
brush
with
brook
in
the
lead
jimmy
explained
a
few
days
before
you
came
alf
he
said
we
had
a
lot
of
excitement
i
told
you
how
penny
fell
down
into
the
old
well
but
i
didn
t
tell
you
that
somebody
came
snooping
around
the
place
that
alf
stared
at
him
you
certainly
didn
t
what
s
the
idea
of
keeping
secrets
from
one
jimmy
grinned
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
i
forgot
all
about
it
first
we
figured
it
was
a
tramp
and
then
when
we
realized
that
he
must
know
his
way
around
our
property
pretty
well
we
decided
it
must
have
been
one
of
those
dopey
villagers
who
think
there
s
buried
treasure
on
the
brook
stopped
to
turn
around
and
glare
at
jimmy
what
do
you
mean
dopey
if
you
don
t
believe
in
that
buried
treasure
why
did
you
lure
us
into
helping
you
dig
up
every
spot
that
didn
t
have
something
growing
on
it
jimmy
s
dark
eyes
twinkled
with
laughter
believe
in
the
treasure
all
right
but
i
wouldn
t
be
dopey
enough
to
trespass
on
other
people
s
property
at
night
trying
to
find
it
you
can
get
a
bullet
through
your
head
very
neatly
that
oh
i
see
what
you
mean
brook
said
completely
mollified
he
started
off
again
at
a
fast
trot
was
your
night
prowler
a
dopey
villager
we
still
don
t
know
jimmy
admitted
he
s
never
come
how
do
you
know
he
hasn
t
alf
demanded
jimmy
groaned
clutching
his
dark
hair
in
mock
dismay
will
you
guys
let
me
try
to
explain
to
you
why
i
want
to
look
at
the
footprints
in
the
clearing
of
course
we
don
t
know
for
sure
he
said
sourly
to
alf
that
our
snoopy
friend
didn
t
come
back
we
only
watched
out
for
him
that
first
night
but
with
all
the
people
who
are
at
the
lodge
now
i
feel
certain
one
of
us
would
have
heard
a
night
i
m
not
at
all
sure
of
that
alf
said
stubbornly
we
all
sleep
like
logs
after
a
day
with
a
slave
driver
like
you
i
can
barely
keep
my
eyes
open
long
enough
to
get
undressed
and
topple
into
shut
up
alf
brook
said
over
his
shoulder
let
the
slavedriver
tell
us
why
we
re
taking
this
long
trek
through
the
thickest
part
of
the
footprints
jimmy
said
in
exasperation
after
phil
and
pat
fired
a
couple
of
shots
in
the
air
the
prowler
scrammed
then
we
went
down
to
have
a
look
at
the
shed
and
sure
enough
somebody
had
been
there
since
we
had
left
right
near
the
spot
where
penny
fell
through
the
rotten
wall
some
floor
boards
had
been
ripped
up
and
there
was
a
footprint
in
the
dirt
staring
us
in
the
that
guy
dopey
alf
muttered
if
he
had
to
go
around
leaving
footprints
all
over
the
place
why
didn
t
he
at
least
put
the
floor
boards
back
so
you
wouldn
t
find
them
jimmy
shrugged
i
figure
he
sneaked
out
from
the
village
to
dig
around
near
where
we
found
the
well
but
just
as
he
got
started
he
realized
that
we
might
not
yet
have
gone
to
bed
in
that
case
one
of
us
might
have
seen
the
flashlight
he
must
have
been
using
so
he
slipped
up
to
the
house
to
have
a
and
then
penny
saw
he
chuckled
after
that
he
didn
t
have
time
to
think
about
covering
up
his
brook
stopped
again
and
mopped
his
brow
i
m
beginning
to
see
that
there
s
a
method
in
your
madness
if
the
footprints
i
saw
in
the
clearing
match
the
one
you
discovered
under
the
shed
floor
then
we
ll
know
that
the
same
man
left
the
old
coat
out
on
the
your
reasoning
my
dear
watson
jimmy
said
grinning
is
excellent
i
will
elucidate
further
the
same
man
is
the
owner
of
the
scrap
you
found
in
the
pocket
of
said
old
coat
and
since
said
note
contained
the
two
words
buried
and
shed
my
guess
is
that
the
rumor
about
buried
treasure
is
more
truth
than
poetry
what
are
we
waiting
for
brook
demanded
you
jimmy
returned
lead
on
after
that
they
saved
their
breath
and
hurried
silently
through
the
mud
and
underbrush
until
at
last
they
emerged
into
a
little
clearing
this
is
it
brook
said
get
out
your
magnifying
glass
jimmy
sank
down
on
his
knees
and
examined
the
footprints
carefully
rubber
heels
he
mumbled
triumphantly
and
made
by
the
same
manufacturer
see
that
crescent
with
a
circle
around
it
it
s
a
golly
alf
and
brook
yelled
in
one
voice
jimmy
stood
up
there
s
only
one
hitch
in
the
whole
deal
i
m
sure
now
that
there
s
something
buried
under
the
old
shed
but
phil
will
never
let
us
dig
for
it
as
long
as
we
need
the
shed
for
a
holy
cow
alf
groaned
then
that
means
you
ll
find
a
barrel
of
gold
after
we
ve
gone
back
to
just
our
luck
brook
said
disconsolately
i
m
never
around
when
there
s
any
excitement
jimmy
threw
back
his
head
and
howled
with
laughter
about
an
hour
ago
he
reminded
brook
you
were
the
very
center
of
excitement
cheer
up
he
added
maybe
when
we
get
back
and
find
that
the
fragment
you
found
fits
the
one
the
girls
found
we
ll
be
able
to
read
something
that
ll
convince
phil
and
penny
we
should
do
something
about
the
ground
under
the
maybe
alf
said
without
much
hope
but
let
s
not
stick
around
here
any
let
s
not
jimmy
agreed
i
vote
we
go
back
to
camp
and
tell
pat
what
we
have
discovered
he
the
idea
of
buried
treasure
as
much
as
phil
and
penny
do
but
when
he
hears
that
the
footprints
match
maybe
he
ll
take
the
whole
business
more
think
brook
said
that
we
ought
to
convince
him
at
least
that
we
should
go
home
right
away
i
d
rather
dig
for
gold
than
fish
wouldn
t
you
jimmy
arched
his
dark
eyebrows
with
surprise
and
you
were
the
guy
who
was
complaining
a
while
ago
that
i
m
a
slavedriver
back
at
camp
pat
listened
soberly
when
jimmy
told
him
that
the
man
who
had
left
his
footprint
under
the
shed
floor
had
left
other
footprints
recently
in
the
clearing
on
the
peninsula
are
you
sure
lad
pat
demanded
jimmy
nodded
it
s
too
much
of
a
coincidence
to
think
that
someone
else
with
the
same
rubber
heels
had
something
to
do
with
this
piece
of
paper
which
looks
like
it
was
torn
from
the
one
marjorie
you
re
right
pat
said
let
s
head
for
home
at
once
chapter
the
missing
fragment
shortly
after
the
boys
left
in
the
station
wagon
for
their
camping
trip
marjorie
said
to
judy
let
s
look
at
that
map
again
penny
could
be
wrong
maybe
it
does
show
exactly
where
treasure
is
let
s
judy
agreed
and
maybe
we
held
it
upside
down
or
something
maybe
the
big
red
cross
doesn
t
mark
the
spot
where
pat
planted
his
they
raced
into
the
lodge
and
down
the
hall
to
the
storage
room
during
the
excitement
of
peter
s
arrival
they
had
left
the
map
still
pasted
in
the
lid
of
the
jewelry
box
on
one
of
the
old
trunks
again
they
took
it
over
to
the
window
and
studied
it
thoughtfully
let
s
see
judy
said
after
awhile
when
you
re
facing
north
west
is
on
your
left
isn
t
it
marjorie
nodded
so
there
s
no
point
in
looking
at
this
darn
thing
any
longer
if
it
isn
t
a
phony
the
treasure
is
buried
under
the
potato
i
give
up
judy
said
with
a
sigh
we
may
as
well
go
down
to
the
beach
and
try
to
find
some
rare
shells
i
suppose
that
s
the
only
buried
treasure
i
ll
have
the
luck
to
during
the
next
few
days
they
filled
a
bucket
with
shells
which
they
hoped
were
collectors
items
but
which
phil
and
peter
told
them
were
worthless
that
is
the
worst
about
being
a
girl
judy
powell
said
in
a
moment
of
disgust
the
boys
will
come
back
with
wonderful
stories
about
how
many
fish
they
caught
and
the
rapids
they
ran
and
everything
judy
s
ideas
of
what
the
boys
were
doing
ran
out
marjorie
and
judy
were
sitting
in
their
favorite
spot
on
the
pier
dangling
their
feet
in
the
water
they
wore
their
bathing
suits
and
had
just
watched
the
cruiser
take
off
with
a
group
of
the
younger
guests
exclusive
of
themselves
they
had
not
wanted
to
go
since
mal
had
promised
to
take
them
on
a
picnic
in
the
woods
just
at
this
moment
they
were
in
the
old
familiar
throes
of
not
knowing
what
to
do
next
let
them
rave
said
marjorie
we
ve
things
to
tell
the
boys
they
wouldn
t
think
that
do
anything
said
judy
rather
crossly
maybe
we
could
think
up
something
different
said
marjorie
a
little
worried
aren
t
you
having
a
good
time
judy
my
yes
i
didn
t
mean
that
judy
said
quickly
i
was
just
thinking
what
a
grand
time
they
must
be
having
i
d
like
to
shoot
come
up
again
next
summer
and
we
ll
get
pat
and
mal
to
take
us
on
a
canoeing
you
probably
couldn
t
get
my
mother
to
say
judy
laughed
let
s
go
back
to
the
house
and
see
if
we
re
missing
just
as
they
started
back
toward
the
lodge
they
heard
the
loud
honking
of
a
car
on
the
drive
oh
cried
judy
i
ll
bet
the
boys
have
come
home
i
wonder
what
made
them
come
back
before
the
week
was
something
awful
must
have
happened
to
one
of
them
marjorie
gasped
as
they
began
to
run
as
fast
as
they
could
sure
enough
the
station
wagon
was
parked
in
front
of
the
lodge
and
the
boys
were
tumbling
out
of
it
they
certainly
don
t
look
as
though
anything
awful
had
happened
to
them
judy
panted
hi
everybody
jimmy
was
shouting
to
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
on
the
porch
when
the
girls
reached
the
steps
they
heard
him
say
quietly
to
penny
and
phil
say
how
about
calling
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
directors
right
away
we
can
t
jimmy
penny
said
everyone
is
well
then
he
said
a
meeting
of
the
allens
in
the
office
i
ve
got
something
in
my
pocket
which
i
think
the
rest
of
the
family
ought
to
know
about
as
soon
as
penny
could
tell
from
the
sober
expression
on
jimmy
s
tanned
face
that
this
was
not
a
joke
she
beckoned
to
phil
and
marjorie
and
led
the
way
into
the
office
on
second
thought
jimmy
said
as
he
followed
her
let
s
get
peter
in
on
this
i
d
like
to
hear
his
opinion
of
the
whole
thing
besides
he
added
in
a
low
teasing
voice
he
s
practically
family
penny
s
cheeks
flamed
jimmy
she
said
mildly
scolding
you
never
can
be
serious
for
more
than
five
minutes
at
a
i
m
pretty
darn
serious
now
jimmy
said
when
they
had
all
gathered
around
the
desk
he
closed
the
door
and
produced
the
scrap
of
paper
which
brook
had
found
in
the
old
coat
after
one
swift
glance
penny
said
why
peter
the
handwriting
looks
just
like
the
one
on
the
fragment
marjorie
found
where
on
earth
did
you
find
it
jimmy
jimmy
explained
and
penny
frowned
as
she
listened
brook
had
no
business
taking
that
envelope
out
of
a
coat
he
found
she
said
peter
chuckled
maybe
he
didn
t
have
any
right
to
take
it
penny
but
in
my
opinion
it
was
put
where
it
was
so
that
no
boy
could
resist
the
penny
thought
for
a
minute
again
she
read
the
blurred
words
more
carefully
this
time
we
ll
meet
a
the
las
and
look
for
the
tre
i
m
sure
it
s
buried
old
shed
nea
has
long
run
then
she
pulled
out
of
her
desk
drawer
the
fragment
marjorie
had
found
in
the
green
bottle
the
two
pieces
fit
together
as
perfectly
as
a
jigsaw
puzzle
now
they
could
all
read
the
complete
page
we
ll
meet
at
the
log
cabin
the
last
week
in
august
and
look
for
the
treasure
again
i
m
sure
it
s
buried
near
the
old
shed
near
a
well
that
has
long
run
dry
oh
oh
jimmy
moaned
that
means
more
digging
i
guess
we
didn
t
dig
deep
but
what
about
the
map
marjorie
demanded
it
showed
that
treasure
was
buried
behind
the
donahues
none
of
it
makes
any
sense
peter
said
calmly
and
you
kids
may
as
well
accept
the
fact
right
now
that
the
map
and
the
two
fragments
aren
t
clues
they
re
obviously
red
herrings
deliberately
planted
to
keep
us
busy
looking
for
buried
i
don
t
get
it
jimmy
said
frankly
it
s
this
way
phil
explained
peter
penny
and
i
figure
that
there
something
valuable
hidden
around
here
somebody
who
obviously
isn
t
honest
knows
where
it
is
he
wants
to
keep
us
from
finding
oh
golly
marjorie
broke
in
wait
until
i
tell
judy
about
this
we
ll
spend
the
rest
of
the
summer
going
over
the
whole
place
with
a
oh
no
you
won
t
penny
said
laughing
i
have
a
better
idea
and
one
that
won
t
drive
our
guests
out
of
their
peter
stared
at
her
in
amazement
have
you
been
keeping
secrets
from
me
he
asked
pretending
that
his
feelings
were
hurt
oh
no
penny
told
him
hastily
the
idea
just
came
to
me
this
minute
actually
the
words
last
week
in
august
gave
it
to
her
cheeks
flushed
with
excitement
she
went
on
one
morning
last
week
when
i
was
out
in
the
kitchen
discussing
menus
with
ann
mary
she
suggested
that
we
give
a
masquerade
party
there
are
plenty
of
grand
costumes
in
the
old
trunks
for
all
of
the
ladies
and
you
men
can
rig
up
outfits
from
old
curtains
and
stuff
in
our
a
swell
idea
jimmy
said
but
what
s
it
got
to
do
with
finding
hidden
treasure
penny
smiled
at
him
patiently
if
you
d
only
let
me
finish
ann
mary
and
i
decided
that
the
last
friday
in
august
would
be
a
good
time
for
the
party
most
of
the
guests
will
be
leaving
early
in
september
so
it
would
be
sort
of
a
last
jimmy
began
to
sing
after
the
ball
is
after
the
guests
have
stop
interrupting
marjorie
said
glaring
at
him
let
penny
well
penny
went
on
we
planned
the
party
just
for
ourselves
and
our
guests
but
now
i
think
we
should
issue
a
blanket
invitation
to
all
the
merchants
in
town
it
will
be
our
way
of
expressing
our
appreciation
of
the
way
they
cooperated
with
us
all
summer
now
she
finished
you
can
all
guess
the
not
me
marjorie
said
rapidly
blinking
her
blue
eyes
jimmy
clutched
his
dark
hair
wildly
i
follow
you
as
closely
as
though
you
d
had
a
head
peter
was
staring
at
penny
with
frank
admiration
you
smart
he
said
don
t
you
see
he
asked
jimmy
and
marjorie
our
x
or
our
x
for
there
may
be
more
than
one
will
certainly
be
among
those
present
at
the
masquerade
with
everyone
coming
masked
and
in
costume
he
wouldn
t
miss
the
chance
he
ll
come
out
sure
that
he
can
get
whatever
he
s
after
and
depart
before
the
holy
cow
jimmy
exploded
penny
smart
instead
of
our
wearing
ourselves
out
looking
for
hidden
treasure
he
ll
lead
us
right
to
marjorie
gave
her
sister
an
impulsive
hug
it
s
the
grandest
idea
anyone
ever
invented
she
cried
and
jimmy
put
in
suddenly
remembering
the
main
reason
why
they
had
persuaded
pat
to
cut
the
camping
trip
short
i
m
pretty
sure
there
s
only
one
don
t
be
a
dope
marjorie
said
i
m
sure
there
are
two
one
of
them
put
the
bottle
where
he
was
sure
judy
and
i
would
find
it
while
we
were
looking
for
shells
and
the
other
put
the
coat
where
you
boys
couldn
t
miss
jimmy
shrugged
maybe
so
but
the
same
x
who
left
his
footprint
under
the
floor
of
the
shed
planted
the
yipes
peter
moaned
what
s
all
this
about
a
footprint
under
the
shed
i
thought
it
was
a
garage
filled
with
it
is
now
penny
explained
with
a
chuckle
before
we
converted
it
someone
ripped
up
part
of
the
floor
and
left
a
footprint
in
the
that
s
right
jimmy
said
and
he
also
left
footprints
in
a
clearing
back
where
brook
found
the
coat
footprints
he
finished
triumphantly
with
rubber
heels
made
by
the
same
why
jimmy
allen
marjorie
gasped
admiringly
you
re
so
smart
you
ought
to
get
a
job
with
the
but
penny
laughed
now
all
the
red
herrings
fit
together
like
the
pieces
of
this
paper
don
t
you
see
jimmy
x
deliberately
left
that
footprint
in
the
shed
in
plain
view
so
i
might
believe
that
he
had
had
something
to
do
with
my
accident
right
peter
right
peter
said
as
soon
as
x
heard
you
had
fallen
down
the
well
he
wrote
the
letter
which
you
received
the
next
day
then
that
evening
he
sneaked
out
to
plant
evidence
which
he
hoped
would
back
up
his
oh
gosh
jimmy
said
disconsolately
we
re
right
back
where
we
started
but
at
least
we
can
be
pretty
sure
that
there
s
only
one
we
can
t
be
sure
of
anything
phil
said
soberly
except
that
whoever
it
is
really
does
mean
business
the
very
fact
that
one
of
them
jumped
on
mal
that
night
when
we
chased
him
away
proves
that
an
ordinary
night
prowler
would
have
tried
to
sneak
away
without
being
well
marjorie
said
cheerfully
we
mean
business
now
too
and
we
re
sure
to
catch
him
the
night
of
the
masquerade
when
he
comes
here
to
get
the
wa
ait
a
minute
phil
said
cautiously
what
s
to
prevent
x
from
getting
by
with
his
scheme
we
can
t
be
everywhere
at
once
in
a
place
as
big
as
this
especially
when
so
many
people
will
be
milling
and
peter
added
how
will
we
know
whom
to
keep
an
eye
on
he
smiled
at
penny
you
planned
of
course
to
have
police
detectives
here
in
costume
no
i
didn
t
penny
admitted
i
thought
it
would
be
more
fun
if
we
set
a
trap
and
caught
or
x
what
sort
of
a
trap
phil
asked
frowning
i
don
t
know
exactly
penny
admitted
but
i
think
it
ought
to
have
something
to
do
with
the
secret
room
for
one
thing
ann
mary
and
i
planned
that
just
before
the
unmasking
we
might
spring
it
on
our
guests
as
a
surprise
none
of
them
except
adra
has
any
idea
where
it
marjorie
felt
very
uncomfortable
at
that
moment
she
opened
her
mouth
to
confess
that
she
had
showed
it
to
judy
but
decided
against
interrupting
penny
until
she
had
finished
when
we
open
the
door
penny
went
on
those
who
want
to
go
down
into
the
room
will
have
to
take
turns
because
it
s
too
small
to
hold
them
all
at
the
same
time
i
thought
that
if
anyone
had
been
acting
suspiciously
before
that
we
might
be
able
to
lure
him
down
alone
and
then
we
could
quickly
press
the
button
and
lock
him
she
added
turning
to
peter
then
you
can
call
in
the
he
shook
his
head
worriedly
are
not
going
to
be
the
one
to
lure
him
down
into
the
room
of
course
not
jimmy
said
quickly
no
you
won
t
phil
told
him
emphatically
the
man
may
be
armed
and
i
m
the
only
one
who
has
a
pistol
license
i
ll
go
down
with
him
and
one
of
you
can
close
the
door
if
he
s
really
been
acting
suspiciously
i
ll
suggest
that
he
unmask
if
he
s
the
man
we
want
he
ll
refuse
then
i
ll
produce
my
gun
and
keep
him
there
while
i
knock
on
the
door
that
will
be
the
signal
that
our
scheme
i
don
t
like
the
idea
of
your
being
locked
down
there
with
him
penny
objected
it
s
the
only
answer
phil
insisted
once
he
has
any
idea
that
we
suspect
him
he
may
make
a
wild
dash
for
safety
and
that
would
frighten
some
of
our
guests
very
badly
besides
he
might
escape
with
all
those
people
wandering
in
and
out
of
the
lodge
i
wouldn
t
dare
use
my
he
turned
to
peter
what
do
you
think
of
the
plan
it
s
okay
except
for
one
thing
peter
said
what
if
x
doesn
t
do
anything
to
make
us
suspect
him
up
until
the
unmasking
we
won
t
have
any
way
of
knowing
whether
he
is
one
of
the
village
merchants
or
not
and
by
that
time
he
will
certainly
have
oh
he
s
bound
to
do
something
to
make
him
stand
out
from
the
others
marjorie
put
in
and
he
ll
probably
be
very
careless
because
he
won
t
have
any
idea
that
we
plan
to
catch
him
in
a
that
s
true
peter
admitted
sometimes
jimmy
said
with
a
teasing
grin
the
gal
makes
phil
stood
up
if
we
re
all
agreed
i
may
as
well
go
down
to
the
village
now
and
spread
the
word
about
the
and
i
said
penny
rising
too
had
better
go
through
the
stuff
in
the
storage
room
and
see
what
we
have
i
thought
it
might
be
fun
to
decorate
the
secret
room
so
it
ll
look
good
and
i
ll
help
marjorie
said
i
know
where
there
s
one
of
those
old
paper
skeletons
that
we
used
to
hang
up
on
hallowe
she
slipped
her
arm
through
penny
s
oh
isn
t
it
going
to
be
fun
even
if
we
don
t
catch
x
the
masquerade
will
be
the
best
event
of
the
whole
i
hope
so
penny
said
and
i
hope
we
do
catch
him
even
if
he
s
just
a
crank
and
isn
t
after
anything
valuable
he
s
annoyed
us
enough
it
s
time
we
put
a
stop
to
she
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
at
peter
who
was
still
sitting
at
the
desk
oh
dear
she
thought
reading
the
anxious
expression
on
his
face
he
still
thinks
we
ought
to
get
help
from
the
she
shivered
involuntarily
maybe
before
the
party
is
over
we
ll
be
sorry
we
didn
t
follow
his
chapter
setting
the
trap
the
next
two
weeks
were
busy
ones
for
everyone
connected
with
the
lodge
from
morning
to
night
there
was
a
terrific
amount
of
hustling
and
bustling
around
the
house
inside
and
out
everyone
was
loaning
something
or
borrowing
something
to
wear
at
the
last
big
party
of
the
season
brook
alf
and
jimmy
all
amateur
but
experienced
electricians
extended
wires
from
the
house
to
the
trees
so
that
the
lawn
would
be
bright
with
lanterns
just
in
case
there
s
no
moon
phil
said
if
it
rains
i
ll
die
marjorie
said
nervously
she
and
judy
were
helping
the
boys
and
judy
insisted
upon
knowing
what
each
one
planned
to
wear
we
re
all
going
as
cowboys
jimmy
called
down
from
the
fork
of
a
tall
tree
how
original
of
you
marjorie
said
sarcastically
and
it
shows
how
lazy
you
are
too
all
you
have
to
do
is
stuff
the
legs
of
your
jeans
in
boots
tie
bandannas
around
your
necks
and
borrow
toy
guns
and
holsters
from
kids
in
the
so
what
alf
demanded
with
masks
on
nobody
will
recognize
us
not
even
you
we
wouldn
t
even
try
judy
informed
him
airily
there
ll
probably
be
so
many
cowboys
here
that
night
it
would
be
like
trying
to
find
a
needle
in
a
i
hope
x
wears
something
more
original
marjorie
said
without
thinking
who
judy
demanded
er
nobody
marjorie
said
hastily
the
allens
at
peter
s
suggestion
had
decided
not
to
share
their
secret
with
any
of
the
other
guests
if
too
many
people
know
that
we
re
planning
to
set
a
trap
he
had
said
it
won
t
be
long
before
x
knows
to
change
the
subject
marjorie
said
to
brook
phil
and
penny
wrote
to
new
york
and
they
heard
today
that
i
can
get
into
that
small
boarding
school
i
told
you
about
it
s
up
on
the
hudson
golly
i
hate
to
think
of
going
away
from
i
know
how
you
feel
brook
said
sympathetically
but
just
the
same
i
m
glad
you
re
going
to
a
school
that
isn
t
very
far
from
mine
when
we
have
dances
you
ll
come
as
my
guest
won
t
you
marjorie
blushed
she
like
brook
and
it
would
be
fun
to
go
to
school
dances
with
him
but
she
wished
he
hadn
t
asked
her
when
jimmy
was
around
jimmy
thought
it
was
fun
to
tease
judy
powell
but
marjorie
knew
that
he
thought
girls
were
a
nuisance
he
also
thought
that
boys
who
asked
girls
to
parties
were
dopes
she
waited
tensely
for
the
caustic
remark
she
knew
was
coming
to
her
surprise
jimmy
said
nothing
he
climbed
down
from
the
fork
of
the
tree
and
gave
her
a
look
which
said
plainer
than
words
watch
your
step
stupid
you
almost
let
the
cat
out
of
the
and
then
marjorie
realized
to
her
dismay
that
all
of
the
others
were
staring
at
her
curiously
every
one
of
them
had
heard
her
blurt
out
i
hope
x
wears
something
more
they
were
overcome
with
curiosity
but
they
were
all
too
polite
to
ask
any
more
questions
hastily
marjorie
said
aren
t
you
all
starving
i
ll
go
ask
ann
mary
if
i
can
t
fix
some
lemonade
and
raid
the
cooky
she
was
off
without
waiting
for
their
replies
but
judy
raced
after
her
marjorie
s
heart
sank
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
earshot
of
the
boys
judy
s
curiosity
would
get
the
better
of
her
good
manners
she
would
demand
an
explanation
of
marjorie
s
unfortunate
remark
then
marjorie
had
an
idea
you
know
she
said
casually
i
ll
bet
a
lot
of
people
come
to
the
party
disguised
as
the
ghost
who
s
supposed
to
haunt
the
lodge
i
think
of
him
as
x
and
he
wears
a
long
gray
beard
it
would
be
hard
to
see
through
that
disguise
i
mean
a
long
flowing
white
robe
a
wig
and
a
mask
with
a
long
gray
judy
looked
disappointed
but
marjorie
knew
that
her
curiosity
was
satisfied
it
would
be
a
perfect
disguise
judy
said
and
much
more
original
than
a
cowboy
back
in
the
lodge
they
found
all
the
other
guests
busy
making
final
decisions
about
their
costumes
the
ladies
had
all
enjoyed
going
through
the
trunks
spending
one
entire
day
rummaging
to
the
great
delight
of
the
younger
fry
some
of
the
people
had
gone
into
town
to
get
extra
things
for
their
costumes
from
the
local
stores
they
reported
that
the
townspeople
too
were
all
excited
about
the
party
and
that
a
great
many
of
them
were
planning
to
come
at
last
it
was
the
day
of
the
big
event
and
to
marjorie
s
delight
the
sun
shone
brightly
in
an
almost
cloudless
sky
penny
had
decided
to
wear
the
old
wedding
dress
from
the
trunk
it
was
beautiful
even
though
it
had
yellowed
with
age
adra
was
wearing
a
green
silk
dress
with
matching
slippers
from
the
same
old
trunk
penny
and
marjorie
helped
each
other
fix
their
costumes
and
marjorie
suggested
to
penny
that
she
should
wear
the
veil
that
went
with
the
dress
and
thus
really
look
like
a
bride
because
sis
marjorie
said
unashamedly
you
going
to
be
a
bride
pretty
soon
you
might
as
well
start
getting
used
to
the
penny
s
cheeks
flamed
then
she
suddenly
threw
her
arms
around
marjorie
oh
honey
if
only
i
could
be
there
s
no
sense
in
my
trying
to
hide
from
you
that
i
love
peter
but
how
can
i
be
sure
that
he
loves
me
marjorie
sniffed
penny
you
idiot
it
s
written
all
over
his
face
whenever
he
looks
at
you
and
when
you
re
not
around
he
mopes
except
when
he
s
shooting
daggers
with
his
eyes
at
charles
penny
couldn
t
help
smiling
then
she
frowned
but
that
doesn
t
mean
i
ll
be
a
bride
very
soon
peter
may
love
me
but
neither
of
us
has
enough
money
to
start
in
housekeeping
maybe
she
added
wistfully
that
s
why
peter
doesn
t
tell
me
now
that
he
loves
marjorie
snorted
you
can
live
on
love
besides
we
must
have
made
a
lot
of
money
on
the
lodge
this
not
really
penny
told
her
we
had
to
hire
an
awful
lot
of
help
you
know
and
this
whole
month
the
laundry
has
been
so
huge
we
had
to
pay
taggart
twice
as
much
as
he
estimated
in
the
beginning
it
had
to
be
taken
into
the
village
four
times
a
she
sighed
and
the
girls
we
originally
hired
to
come
out
only
to
wait
on
the
tables
and
help
with
the
ironing
had
to
work
full
never
mind
marjorie
said
consolingly
it
s
been
penny
brightened
oh
i
don
t
mean
that
we
didn
t
make
any
money
there
s
enough
to
see
you
and
jimmy
through
school
but
phil
and
i
want
you
to
go
to
college
both
of
we
won
t
go
marjorie
said
stanchly
not
if
it
means
you
can
t
marry
peter
when
he
asks
you
to
after
the
experience
we
ve
had
this
summer
we
can
both
get
she
pirouetted
around
the
room
don
t
you
think
i
d
make
somebody
a
wonderful
secretary
penny
giggled
but
not
a
very
dignified
one
no
honey
she
went
on
seriously
don
t
you
worry
your
pretty
head
about
getting
a
job
just
yet
things
will
work
out
somehow
i
know
they
to
herself
she
added
if
peter
asks
me
to
marry
him
i
ll
say
yes
we
can
work
things
i
tell
you
what
let
s
do
marjorie
cried
let
s
have
dress
rehearsal
right
now
here
in
your
room
just
us
and
judy
cause
she
s
going
to
be
my
twin
and
ann
mary
so
she
can
give
our
costumes
a
final
she
danced
away
in
a
short
while
they
were
all
crowding
into
penny
s
room
laughing
and
making
fun
of
each
other
marjorie
and
judy
were
dressed
alike
in
little
swiss
peasant
girl
costumes
jimmy
made
a
very
handsome
cowboy
and
philip
was
a
swashbuckling
pirate
a
banquet
was
to
be
served
at
midnight
after
the
unmasking
and
since
this
was
the
event
of
the
summer
ann
mary
had
included
all
her
specialties
in
the
menu
she
stayed
at
the
dress
rehearsal
only
long
enough
to
assure
them
that
they
all
looked
wonderful
then
hurried
away
in
spite
of
preparations
the
allens
and
peter
made
time
for
a
final
conference
in
the
office
let
s
try
to
have
as
much
fun
as
possible
peter
said
but
we
mustn
t
forget
for
one
minute
that
we
re
all
that
s
right
phil
agreed
if
any
one
of
us
notices
a
guest
acting
suspiciously
he
or
she
must
report
at
once
to
the
others
there
ll
be
over
a
hundred
people
here
tonight
so
we
ve
all
got
to
be
on
our
toes
every
minute
he
added
soberly
jimmy
nodded
every
minute
until
the
unmasking
anyway
which
means
between
the
hours
of
ten
and
midnight
not
many
people
will
arrive
before
ten
even
though
we
invited
them
to
come
at
penny
was
sketching
a
floor
plan
of
the
lodge
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
whatever
x
is
after
she
said
it
obviously
isn
t
buried
on
the
grounds
if
it
were
he
wouldn
t
have
planted
those
red
herrings
therefore
it
s
probably
in
the
house
if
it
s
upstairs
all
we
have
to
do
is
make
sure
that
nobody
but
our
house
guests
and
help
goes
up
without
our
knowing
it
we
all
know
what
costumes
they
ll
be
wearing
so
that
s
easy
but
it
will
be
peter
and
marjorie
s
job
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
back
stairs
jimmy
and
i
the
everyone
nodded
and
penny
went
on
if
it
s
downstairs
x
will
know
that
he
hasn
t
got
a
prayer
of
searching
for
it
unless
it
s
in
the
office
or
the
storage
room
and
i
ve
locked
those
doors
securely
so
he
can
t
slip
in
and
out
unnoticed
the
other
downstairs
rooms
will
be
filled
with
people
all
the
time
including
the
kitchen
the
logical
time
for
him
to
try
to
find
whatever
he
plans
to
steal
will
be
when
everyone
is
gathered
in
one
she
smiled
up
at
peter
in
order
to
be
sure
we
catch
x
in
our
trap
i
have
carefully
dropped
hints
throughout
the
village
that
at
on
the
dot
we
re
going
to
show
our
guests
the
secret
room
don
t
you
think
he
ll
choose
that
time
when
everyone
s
attention
will
be
concentrated
on
one
spot
to
do
something
which
will
attract
our
attention
i
certainly
do
peter
said
he
ll
be
the
one
guest
at
that
moment
who
won
t
crowd
into
the
alcove
to
see
how
the
secret
door
works
unless
he
added
thoughtfully
whatever
he
happens
to
be
after
is
in
the
secret
room
i
thought
of
that
penny
said
and
since
he
can
t
possibly
know
how
the
secret
doors
works
he
ll
wait
until
after
that
part
of
the
evening
s
entertainment
is
over
then
he
ll
try
to
sneak
back
and
go
down
into
the
room
while
we
re
she
chuckled
in
that
case
he
ll
walk
right
into
our
trap
after
the
last
guest
has
left
phil
can
stay
behind
and
hide
in
the
alcove
if
x
sneaks
back
and
goes
down
into
the
room
all
phil
has
to
do
is
fasten
the
door
from
the
outside
once
x
is
safely
down
the
stairs
then
we
can
call
the
police
for
obviously
no
honest
person
would
go
into
the
secret
room
without
our
i
object
jimmy
said
according
to
that
scheme
we
ll
catch
x
but
we
still
won
t
know
what
he
was
trying
to
i
agree
with
jimmy
phil
said
so
instead
of
hiding
in
the
alcove
after
the
guests
have
all
seen
the
secret
room
i
ll
hide
down
in
the
room
itself
behind
the
black
draperies
you
ve
hung
on
the
walls
if
he
sneaks
back
i
ll
stay
there
until
he
s
got
whatever
he
s
trying
to
get
then
at
the
point
of
my
gun
i
ll
make
him
turn
it
over
to
me
and
penny
interrupted
with
a
frown
i
still
don
t
like
the
idea
of
your
being
down
in
the
room
alone
with
someone
who
may
be
a
dangerous
criminal
oh
penny
marjorie
cried
impulsively
phil
can
take
care
of
himself
besides
x
won
t
have
any
idea
that
he
s
hiding
behind
the
black
curtains
also
she
added
what
x
wants
may
not
be
in
the
secret
room
after
that
s
true
penny
admitted
reluctantly
then
the
scheme
is
this
peter
said
summing
it
up
if
you
and
marjorie
see
a
stranger
sneak
upstairs
before
the
unmasking
you
re
to
report
at
once
to
phil
jimmy
and
me
we
ll
follow
him
and
catch
him
in
the
act
if
no
one
does
anything
suspicious
phil
will
remain
in
the
secret
room
after
the
guests
have
seen
it
pat
who
will
open
the
door
will
close
it
when
everyone
has
left
the
alcove
then
we
ll
all
go
into
the
big
room
for
the
unmasking
and
wait
until
phil
signals
that
he
has
caught
a
rat
in
his
trap
you
can
do
that
phil
he
finished
as
we
already
agreed
by
banging
on
the
and
so
the
final
arrangements
were
made
but
penny
as
she
hurried
upstairs
with
marjorie
to
dress
for
the
occasion
knew
that
peter
was
worried
he
didn
t
like
the
idea
of
phil
being
locked
in
the
secret
room
with
x
any
more
than
she
did
but
she
realized
suddenly
phil
won
t
be
in
after
all
even
though
we
may
deliberately
play
into
x
s
hands
by
showing
him
how
to
get
into
the
secret
room
he
won
t
know
where
the
spring
is
that
closes
the
door
on
the
other
and
as
marjorie
pointed
out
while
they
helped
each
other
with
their
costumes
the
whole
thing
may
be
a
flop
we
don
t
know
for
sure
that
there
is
anything
valuable
hidden
in
the
lodge
or
that
x
will
be
among
those
present
chapter
philip
traps
a
thief
peter
wyland
knew
that
penny
would
be
coming
down
the
back
way
when
she
was
ready
instead
of
down
the
stairs
from
the
balcony
when
he
was
in
his
costume
he
waited
at
the
foot
of
the
back
stairs
the
large
room
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
was
dimly
lit
presently
penny
a
sweet
vision
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
steps
she
gathered
her
draperies
for
the
descent
unconscious
of
anyone
s
presence
the
veil
which
marjorie
had
persuaded
her
to
wear
floated
behind
her
caught
back
from
her
face
by
pins
and
a
white
rose
when
she
was
halfway
down
peter
stepped
into
the
light
penny
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
look
lovely
i
should
have
been
waiting
here
with
a
minister
peter
was
beside
the
surprised
penny
in
a
moment
leading
her
down
the
few
remaining
steps
to
the
room
where
he
tenderly
put
his
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her
i
can
t
wait
any
longer
penny
to
tell
you
how
i
love
you
peter
s
voice
was
a
little
nervous
what
he
had
intended
to
say
deserted
him
will
you
will
you
wear
a
dress
like
this
for
me
soon
penny
who
had
not
had
a
chance
to
utter
a
word
and
whose
breath
was
taken
away
by
the
surprise
of
having
peter
kiss
her
merely
said
oh
why
peter
as
he
led
her
to
a
little
sofa
in
the
corner
of
the
room
sit
here
with
me
just
a
minute
penny
i
ve
been
waiting
to
ask
you
for
so
long
only
i
ve
never
known
whether
you
were
just
being
kind
and
sweet
to
me
because
you
re
that
way
with
everyone
or
whether
you
could
like
me
well
enough
to
marry
me
i
saw
that
there
was
charles
curtis
but
if
you
were
engaged
to
him
i
figured
phil
would
tip
me
off
i
am
sort
of
a
coward
where
you
are
concerned
penny
don
t
tell
me
that
you
like
charley
best
do
you
love
me
a
little
peter
s
voice
was
low
and
eager
he
held
one
of
penny
s
hands
tightly
in
his
penny
was
not
the
sort
to
keep
the
man
she
loved
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
did
you
know
you
ve
loved
me
all
summer
peter
i
wish
you
d
told
me
sooner
because
you
see
i
ve
been
in
love
with
you
it
was
all
right
at
last
i
knew
last
year
that
i
loved
you
peter
but
i
couldn
t
very
well
let
you
know
it
penny
s
hand
was
almost
crushed
as
peter
s
face
lit
up
with
joy
he
swept
her
into
his
arms
again
for
another
kiss
and
penny
said
i
could
stay
here
and
forget
all
about
my
duties
to
my
guests
but
we
mustn
t
forget
about
x
and
i
ll
have
to
go
upstairs
again
peter
see
how
you
have
mussed
this
not
beyond
repair
i
hope
he
said
smiling
penny
before
you
go
say
you
ll
marry
me
this
fall
as
soon
as
the
guests
leave
silly
man
you
take
my
breath
away
penny
laughed
but
it
is
wonderful
that
you
are
silly
about
me
peter
i
can
t
think
straight
right
this
minute
but
we
ll
talk
about
it
later
marjorie
and
jimmy
are
going
to
school
in
september
phil
is
going
to
new
york
to
work
for
prentice
and
to
go
to
school
nights
he
wants
to
be
near
adra
mercy
i
m
all
mixed
up
there
will
be
so
much
to
see
to
could
you
could
we
have
our
honeymoon
right
here
i
can
t
think
of
a
more
wonderful
spot
peter
said
our
life
is
going
to
be
all
honeymoon
from
now
on
as
long
as
i
know
we
love
each
other
that
s
enough
to
make
me
walk
on
air
the
rest
of
the
evening
what
a
pity
we
can
t
be
by
ourselves
i
ll
be
thinking
of
you
every
single
minute
peter
waited
until
penny
went
back
to
her
room
to
repair
damages
it
took
her
but
a
few
minutes
and
when
she
made
her
appearance
in
the
living
room
she
was
immediately
surrounded
and
admired
by
everyone
with
the
keen
eye
of
an
experienced
hostess
she
glanced
around
to
see
that
everyone
was
being
entertained
in
some
fashion
she
recognized
most
of
the
guests
regardless
of
their
masks
and
she
noted
that
there
was
quite
an
assembly
of
townspeople
whom
she
could
not
recognize
because
of
their
disguises
and
curtis
were
dressed
as
george
and
martha
washington
and
they
looked
very
distinguished
they
were
talking
to
marjorie
just
now
and
saying
something
that
made
her
laugh
there
was
charles
curtis
dancing
with
a
lovely
girl
who
had
spent
several
weekends
at
the
lodge
and
had
come
back
for
the
masquerade
when
he
danced
by
penny
he
stopped
for
a
minute
and
said
i
ll
wager
that
this
is
our
fair
hostess
shall
i
telephone
the
parson
it
s
hard
to
resist
such
a
bride
you
are
incorrigible
charles
penny
reported
and
you
look
radiant
tonight
and
off
he
danced
with
his
partner
it
was
hard
for
penny
to
get
her
mind
on
anything
else
except
peter
dear
eager
wonderful
peter
but
she
had
many
things
to
do
the
tables
in
the
dining
room
had
to
be
checked
and
then
she
had
to
return
and
take
part
in
the
party
she
looked
around
at
the
guests
once
more
trying
to
place
some
of
those
who
did
not
look
familiar
there
was
one
masquerader
in
particular
who
caught
her
eye
he
was
dressed
as
the
bearded
ghost
that
was
supposed
to
wander
about
the
lodge
but
aside
from
the
long
beard
and
white
wig
he
seemed
to
be
quite
young
vigorous
and
active
he
was
too
heavy
for
alf
who
had
once
said
something
about
dressing
up
as
a
graybeard
he
was
with
adra
a
good
deal
of
the
time
but
mingled
with
the
rest
and
danced
well
all
the
guests
had
arrived
and
the
party
was
in
full
swing
it
was
nearly
time
for
philip
to
announce
that
he
was
going
to
show
everybody
the
secret
room
peter
came
into
the
room
just
a
few
minutes
before
this
and
slipping
an
arm
around
penny
he
said
congratulate
me
phil
i
m
going
to
be
your
philip
stared
a
moment
then
put
a
hand
on
peter
s
shoulder
and
told
him
there
was
no
one
to
whom
he
d
rather
hand
over
penny
good
work
peter
he
said
congratulations
even
if
she
is
my
sister
i
must
say
you
re
getting
a
wonderful
nobody
knows
that
better
than
i
peter
said
humbly
stop
it
you
two
penny
cried
i
ll
get
a
head
too
big
for
my
shoulders
if
you
keep
it
up
by
the
way
do
either
of
you
recognize
that
man
over
there
disguised
as
graybeard
i
think
that
s
sanders
he
said
something
about
wearing
such
a
costume
when
alf
gave
up
the
idea
said
peter
no
it
isn
t
sanders
penny
said
but
there
s
something
very
familiar
about
him
i
m
sure
i
know
him
but
i
can
t
quite
put
my
finger
on
who
he
has
he
done
anything
suspicious
phil
asked
not
a
thing
penny
admitted
then
she
laughed
but
he
has
been
paying
quite
a
lot
of
attention
to
adra
you
d
better
watch
out
phil
frowned
i
ll
be
glad
when
this
evening
is
over
i
ve
hardly
had
a
chance
to
speak
to
adra
since
breakfast
and
and
well
i
guess
you
two
know
how
i
feel
about
we
do
penny
told
him
smiling
but
the
question
is
does
she
she
gave
him
a
fond
pat
on
the
cheek
faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
that
s
right
peter
said
grinning
once
you
get
used
to
the
idea
phil
proposing
to
the
girl
you
love
isn
t
so
i
suppose
not
phil
said
dubiously
but
if
i
rush
matters
i
might
ruin
my
chances
with
marjorie
joined
them
then
nobody
s
done
anything
suspicious
at
all
she
complained
the
whole
scheme
is
a
the
evening
isn
t
over
yet
penny
reminded
her
she
tucked
her
hand
in
the
crook
of
peter
s
arm
blushing
we
re
going
to
announce
our
engagement
at
the
banquet
and
if
phil
takes
my
advice
he
ll
propose
to
adra
before
the
party
is
she
smiled
at
marjorie
isn
t
that
enough
excitement
for
you
oh
oh
marjorie
cried
hugging
penny
i
m
so
glad
wait
until
i
tell
she
was
off
completely
forgetting
to
congratulate
the
a
short
while
after
that
penny
went
upstairs
with
adra
and
told
her
that
she
and
peter
were
engaged
i
m
so
happy
for
you
both
adra
said
rather
wistfully
penny
said
nothing
but
she
guessed
that
when
phil
did
propose
the
answer
would
be
yes
she
hurried
downstairs
again
for
from
the
balcony
she
could
see
that
the
guests
were
already
crowding
into
the
alcove
most
of
the
younger
men
as
marjorie
had
predicted
were
dressed
as
cowboys
complete
with
bandannas
chaps
and
guns
in
their
holsters
penny
had
not
been
able
to
pick
out
brook
and
alf
but
she
knew
that
jimmy
was
the
tallest
cowboy
of
them
all
he
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
everybody
s
all
set
he
told
her
pat
s
pressing
the
button
that
moves
the
bookshelves
when
adra
came
down
from
the
balcony
he
added
let
s
wait
out
here
it
ll
only
add
to
the
confusion
if
we
who
have
already
seen
the
secret
room
join
the
crowd
in
the
all
right
adra
said
sitting
on
the
bottom
step
i
m
exhausted
graybeard
is
a
wonderful
dancer
but
he
never
wants
to
stop
for
a
who
is
that
guy
anyway
jimmy
asked
he
looks
familiar
but
i
can
t
place
neither
can
i
penny
said
but
then
i
can
t
place
a
lot
of
the
people
she
pointed
to
two
cowboys
who
were
standing
just
outside
the
alcove
for
instance
are
those
two
guests
alf
and
brook
i
wouldn
t
and
then
penny
saw
something
that
made
her
turn
and
race
up
the
stairs
the
guns
that
those
two
cowboys
were
slipping
from
their
holsters
were
not
toy
pistols
even
at
that
distance
she
could
see
that
they
were
small
but
automatics
in
the
meantime
philip
in
the
alcove
was
making
his
little
speech
to
the
assembled
guests
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
and
waited
a
moment
for
attention
there
is
one
little
feature
of
allen
lodge
that
has
not
been
on
exhibit
a
place
we
call
the
secret
philip
paused
again
for
effect
this
time
and
a
murmur
of
interest
ran
around
the
room
when
we
first
moved
into
this
lodge
we
found
it
accidentally
and
we
decided
to
surprise
you
with
it
tonight
this
room
has
a
curious
entrance
and
when
i
open
the
door
you
will
see
the
little
wall
safe
that
has
held
your
money
and
jewelry
we
are
sorry
to
say
there
is
no
other
treasure
down
there
believe
me
when
we
heard
of
the
rumors
about
buried
treasure
we
turned
the
place
upside
down
to
see
if
we
could
find
it
without
philip
deliberately
assumed
a
very
disappointed
look
on
his
face
and
the
guests
all
laughed
then
he
went
on
but
maybe
the
allens
didn
t
look
in
the
right
places
and
possibly
graybeard
the
ghost
i
see
here
tonight
may
find
some
treasure
for
us
masks
and
costumes
are
appropriate
to
our
mysterious
visit
to
a
mysterious
room
look
for
treasure
we
will
have
to
go
down
in
groups
since
it
is
a
small
room
the
people
immediately
surrounding
me
can
come
down
first
and
perhaps
graybeard
will
lend
atmosphere
by
posing
near
the
i
d
be
delighted
graybeard
said
philip
glanced
at
him
thinking
his
voice
is
familiar
but
i
m
sure
he
isn
t
any
of
the
merchants
in
the
village
we
deal
aloud
he
continued
his
speech
when
we
come
back
up
from
the
secret
room
we
ll
unmask
and
go
into
the
big
dining
room
for
the
banquet
i
hope
you
have
all
been
keeping
a
list
of
the
people
whom
you
think
you
have
recognized
as
you
know
we
re
going
to
gather
up
your
lists
as
you
enter
the
dining
room
during
the
banquet
prizes
will
be
awarded
to
the
guests
who
have
guessed
the
largest
number
of
people
after
the
applause
that
followed
philip
s
speech
pat
pressed
the
button
that
moved
the
bookshelves
aside
from
then
on
philip
was
kept
busy
leading
one
little
party
after
another
down
into
the
secret
room
graybeard
went
with
the
first
group
and
added
to
the
ghostly
atmosphere
by
posing
near
the
safe
behind
him
the
paper
skeleton
dangled
precariously
from
the
ceiling
when
the
last
guest
had
inspected
the
little
room
and
had
gone
back
up
the
stairs
to
the
alcove
philip
said
to
graybeard
thanks
for
helping
us
out
you
make
a
swell
ghost
who
are
you
anyway
never
mind
said
a
cold
crisp
voice
turn
around
and
come
down
the
steps
with
your
hands
with
one
swift
gesture
philip
released
the
spring
that
closed
the
secret
door
then
he
turned
to
face
the
gun
graybeard
was
pointing
at
him
philip
was
caught
in
his
own
trap
but
at
least
the
man
and
his
pistol
could
neither
harm
nor
frighten
the
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
philip
came
slowly
down
the
steps
so
you
re
our
mysterious
x
he
said
coolly
call
me
anything
you
like
graybeard
said
taking
philip
s
own
pistol
from
his
pocket
now
open
that
philip
shrugged
anything
to
he
said
and
don
t
try
to
pull
any
tricks
graybeard
warned
him
upstairs
two
men
i
hired
for
the
occasion
are
at
this
very
moment
relieving
your
guests
of
their
excess
jewelry
and
so
it
was
a
planned
robbery
and
graybeard
s
henchmen
had
probably
come
disguised
as
cowboys
carrying
real
pistols
in
their
holsters
for
a
moment
phil
was
paralyzed
with
worry
about
the
girls
penny
and
marjorie
were
so
impulsive
would
they
submit
quietly
to
a
holdup
and
adra
he
felt
sure
that
the
older
women
although
they
would
be
frightened
at
the
sight
of
guns
would
do
nothing
which
might
arouse
the
anger
of
armed
criminals
but
the
girls
the
voice
behind
the
mask
repeated
menacingly
that
safe
philip
quickly
obeyed
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
peter
had
been
right
all
along
they
should
have
called
on
the
police
for
help
philip
twirled
the
dial
and
opened
the
door
of
the
safe
help
yourself
he
said
curtly
i
am
very
much
engaged
in
watching
you
replied
the
man
philip
had
no
choice
he
emptied
the
safe
and
handed
its
contents
to
the
masked
burglar
there
was
a
good
sum
of
money
the
payments
of
the
guests
for
the
week
it
was
mostly
in
checks
and
a
great
deal
of
the
jewelry
had
been
removed
from
the
safe
for
the
occasion
philip
was
thanking
his
lucky
stars
that
they
didn
t
keep
too
much
cash
valuable
articles
or
important
papers
philip
tried
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
man
s
face
under
his
beard
but
it
and
the
mask
over
his
nose
and
eyes
completely
hid
his
features
could
this
really
be
the
mysterious
x
no
philip
decided
graybeard
was
nothing
but
a
common
ordinary
burglar
and
yet
there
was
something
familiar
about
him
the
man
tucked
the
money
into
his
pocket
then
looked
contemptuously
at
the
bit
of
jewelry
but
put
it
into
another
pocket
philip
listened
to
hurrying
footsteps
overhead
and
could
see
that
graybeard
was
perturbed
by
them
but
there
was
no
catching
this
man
off
guard
he
held
the
gun
close
to
philip
every
minute
he
again
ordered
philip
to
put
his
hands
into
the
air
while
he
felt
around
the
inside
of
the
safe
philip
could
not
help
but
think
what
a
curious
picture
this
man
with
his
long
gray
beard
made
as
he
searched
through
the
empty
safe
with
one
hand
and
kept
his
pistol
pointed
at
philip
with
the
other
what
on
earth
was
he
searching
for
then
philip
heard
a
little
click
and
suddenly
a
drawer
on
two
little
steel
rods
dropped
down
from
inside
the
top
of
the
safe
missed
that
part
of
it
didn
t
you
graybeard
sneered
empty
that
drawer
and
hand
me
the
philip
was
so
surprised
he
stood
there
with
his
mouth
open
for
a
full
minute
then
with
great
interest
he
looked
at
this
drawer
that
he
had
never
seen
before
it
was
wide
and
shallow
and
full
of
papers
evidently
a
little
hidden
spring
had
released
the
rods
that
held
the
drawer
in
place
could
this
be
the
place
where
the
rumored
treasure
was
supposed
to
be
hidden
philip
mentally
kicked
himself
for
not
having
thought
of
such
a
possibility
before
much
good
it
would
do
them
now
idiot
that
he
had
been
not
to
have
taken
ordinary
precautions
that
night
what
fools
they
had
all
been
not
to
follow
peter
s
advice
no
wonder
x
graybeard
had
planted
red
herrings
guaranteed
to
keep
jimmy
and
marjorie
searching
everywhere
for
hidden
treasure
except
in
their
own
safe
quit
stalling
graybeard
growled
poking
philip
with
his
gun
come
on
hand
over
that
stuff
and
make
it
snappy
the
boys
upstairs
must
be
about
ready
to
philip
took
from
the
drawer
two
packages
of
old
papers
that
looked
like
receipted
bills
and
a
large
bulging
manila
envelope
this
graybeard
snatched
from
phil
s
hand
and
pocketed
it
with
a
satisfied
air
he
glanced
at
the
old
papers
and
said
you
can
throw
those
away
what
i
want
is
bound
to
be
in
this
he
went
on
in
a
patronizing
voice
thanks
sonny
boy
if
you
hadn
t
played
right
into
my
hands
i
might
have
had
to
use
some
soup
to
blow
the
lock
off
that
safe
messy
stuff
soup
and
noisy
when
i
heard
you
were
going
to
throw
this
ball
and
show
your
guests
the
secret
room
i
decided
to
let
one
of
you
dopey
allens
open
it
for
he
patted
the
pocket
into
which
he
had
stuffed
the
old
manila
envelope
what
i
have
here
is
much
more
valuable
than
all
the
money
and
jewels
the
men
i
hired
have
taken
from
your
guests
they
can
keep
whatever
they
collected
as
their
just
what
is
in
that
old
envelope
phil
asked
stalling
for
time
the
man
in
the
boasting
triumphant
mood
he
was
now
in
might
be
caught
momentarily
off
guard
graybeard
chuckled
evilly
wouldn
t
you
like
to
know
i
certainly
would
philip
said
and
added
shrewdly
i
should
think
you
d
like
to
too
after
all
it
may
be
stuffed
with
nothing
but
more
old
receipted
the
man
struck
by
this
thought
glared
at
philip
through
his
mask
never
thought
of
that
he
muttered
and
hastily
shifted
the
gun
from
his
right
hand
to
his
left
so
he
could
reach
into
his
pocket
and
open
the
envelope
in
that
split
second
philip
went
into
action
before
graybeard
knew
what
was
happening
the
pistol
had
been
knocked
from
his
hand
at
the
same
moment
philip
s
fist
crashed
against
his
jaw
graybeard
went
limp
and
toppled
to
the
floor
phil
leaped
over
his
unconscious
body
to
retrieve
the
gun
then
he
took
his
own
pistol
from
graybeard
s
pocket
now
the
tables
are
nicely
turned
phil
chuckled
he
quickly
tore
strips
from
the
black
draperies
on
the
wall
and
tied
the
man
s
hands
and
feet
together
he
worked
fast
because
he
was
worried
about
what
was
going
on
upstairs
then
he
heard
sounds
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
steps
phil
held
his
pistol
ready
one
of
the
gunmen
worried
by
the
prolonged
absence
of
graybeard
might
be
coming
down
to
see
what
was
happening
in
the
secret
room
the
door
swung
open
and
to
phil
s
relief
pat
leaped
down
the
stairs
phil
met
him
halfway
what
happened
he
asked
nervously
the
girls
are
they
all
right
everybody
s
just
fine
pat
said
grinning
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
later
let
s
see
what
you
have
here
he
bent
down
and
yanked
the
beard
and
mask
from
the
unconscious
man
s
face
whew
pat
and
phil
whistled
in
one
breath
our
nice
cheap
laundry
man
for
it
was
taggart
and
as
he
regained
consciousness
glaring
with
rage
up
at
phil
his
face
was
anything
but
pleasant
chapter
forgotten
treasure
pat
swiftly
untied
taggart
s
feet
get
up
he
ordered
your
pals
are
waiting
for
you
in
a
nice
shiny
prowl
car
in
front
of
the
the
police
phil
gasped
but
how
pat
grinned
the
whole
was
a
washout
oh
some
of
the
ladies
got
a
little
scared
when
we
all
suddenly
found
ourselves
facing
those
cowboys
and
their
guns
and
i
was
pretty
worried
about
you
myself
when
i
saw
the
door
close
and
guessed
you
were
trapped
down
here
with
the
he
chuckled
penny
saved
the
day
just
before
the
was
to
take
place
she
happened
to
notice
that
two
of
the
cowboys
who
were
loitering
out
in
the
hall
were
carrying
real
guns
she
raced
upstairs
and
called
the
he
laughed
at
the
chagrined
expression
on
taggart
s
face
the
police
arrived
shortly
after
our
friend
s
pals
had
collected
their
loot
in
fact
they
walked
out
of
the
door
and
right
into
the
arms
of
two
of
the
biggest
cops
i
ve
ever
those
fools
taggart
snarled
i
told
jerry
and
rick
not
to
let
anyone
out
of
their
sight
once
the
secret
door
was
pat
as
he
deftly
emptied
taggart
s
pockets
told
him
they
didn
t
exactly
her
dash
upstairs
to
the
phone
in
her
room
she
went
so
quickly
and
so
quietly
they
didn
t
even
know
she
wasn
t
among
those
present
downstairs
when
it
finally
dawned
on
them
that
none
of
their
victims
was
dressed
as
a
bride
i
imagine
they
guessed
that
the
game
was
up
and
decided
to
scram
without
waiting
to
see
what
had
happened
to
their
he
gave
taggart
a
push
get
going
he
said
gruffly
there
s
a
nice
shiny
pair
of
bracelets
waiting
for
it
was
after
one
when
the
men
returned
from
the
precinct
station
after
preferring
charges
against
the
three
men
the
girls
were
waiting
excitedly
for
them
on
the
porch
oh
phil
marjorie
yelled
running
down
the
steps
to
think
that
graybeard
was
taggart
our
laundryman
and
none
of
us
saw
through
his
well
phil
said
it
was
a
good
disguise
for
one
thing
and
he
was
careful
to
spend
most
of
his
time
with
adra
who
had
never
seen
adra
smiled
rather
shamefacedly
i
m
such
a
lazybones
he
usually
came
in
the
morning
before
i
was
up
when
he
did
come
later
in
the
day
i
guess
i
was
always
off
somewhere
having
a
good
time
while
you
allens
that
s
what
you
were
supposed
to
be
doing
penny
said
smiling
you
re
our
guest
remember
never
mind
about
that
marjorie
interrupted
impatiently
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
or
not
taggart
was
she
tugged
phil
s
arm
leading
him
to
a
seat
beside
her
on
the
porch
glider
did
he
plant
the
clues
we
found
and
write
us
the
threatening
letters
phil
nodded
the
other
men
were
merely
hired
by
him
for
the
evening
to
keep
the
guests
out
of
his
hair
while
he
looked
for
a
secret
drawer
in
the
safe
he
made
a
complete
confession
before
we
left
the
police
oh
oh
marjorie
cried
jumping
up
then
the
mystery
is
solved
tell
us
everything
phil
right
he
patted
her
hand
affectionately
not
now
honey
first
we
must
think
of
our
guests
family
affairs
can
come
once
everybody
was
in
the
dining
room
its
light
and
decorations
made
a
gay
setting
for
the
return
to
normal
feelings
as
philip
followed
the
last
guest
into
the
room
penny
said
adra
and
i
were
just
sick
with
worry
over
you
phil
i
want
to
know
every
single
thing
that
happened
as
soon
as
possible
are
you
sure
you
re
all
right
i
m
fine
phil
assured
her
jimmy
too
caught
philip
and
said
good
work
phil
when
do
i
get
to
hear
the
whole
story
as
soon
as
the
guests
have
all
gone
home
or
to
bed
in
the
lodge
philip
said
it
s
a
long
he
turned
to
penny
and
it
was
your
quickwittedness
that
made
it
have
a
happy
i
didn
t
do
anything
but
dash
up
to
my
room
and
call
the
police
penny
said
you
re
a
hero
by
now
of
course
everyone
had
removed
his
mask
and
all
the
faces
were
familiar
ones
philip
moved
on
to
a
space
at
the
central
table
where
he
and
adra
were
going
to
sit
together
he
held
her
hand
in
a
firm
clasp
and
her
fingers
twined
in
response
peter
smiled
at
him
and
clapped
his
hands
together
for
order
speech
speech
philip
smiled
at
everybody
and
didn
t
seem
at
all
nervous
or
upset
after
his
experience
of
the
evening
i
m
very
sorry
he
began
that
robbers
chose
us
for
their
victims
tonight
and
that
i
could
not
prevent
your
disagreeable
it
was
fun
judy
interrupted
impulsively
for
the
longest
time
i
thought
it
was
just
an
act
jimmy
and
alf
were
putting
on
what
i
ll
have
to
tell
the
girls
when
i
get
back
to
cincinnati
philip
smiled
at
her
and
continued
i
hope
that
you
all
can
forget
the
unpleasant
part
of
the
evening
and
that
you
will
enjoy
the
feast
ann
mary
prepared
i
have
here
the
jewelry
and
wallets
and
handbags
the
armed
cowboys
took
from
you
as
i
hold
up
each
item
will
the
owner
please
come
and
get
his
or
her
property
while
the
food
was
being
served
philip
distributed
the
stolen
articles
to
their
owners
i
was
much
too
surprised
to
be
frightened
at
first
said
curtis
calmly
pouring
cream
into
her
coffee
indeed
like
judy
i
thought
for
quite
a
while
that
it
was
some
stunt
the
boys
had
thought
up
the
young
people
today
are
always
doing
some
crazy
i
was
nearly
speechless
at
those
guns
said
powell
i
don
t
know
what
the
country
is
coming
to
but
it
was
all
over
so
quickly
i
don
t
suppose
i
was
much
more
frightened
than
i
would
have
been
trying
to
get
across
a
busy
that
my
dear
is
slightly
underestimating
it
at
least
for
me
said
powell
i
was
just
plain
worried
one
of
those
guns
would
go
i
certainly
hated
to
see
my
jewelry
gathered
in
remarked
sanders
the
prizes
were
awarded
and
there
was
music
afterwards
some
of
the
older
people
retired
soon
but
as
this
was
the
last
general
celebration
the
younger
set
preferred
to
linger
philip
whose
duties
as
host
had
been
accomplished
wasted
no
time
but
took
adra
to
a
moonlit
walk
and
pretty
nook
on
the
shore
where
they
sat
on
the
sand
and
talked
philip
told
adra
of
his
feeling
of
responsibility
for
his
brother
and
sisters
now
penny
is
engaged
to
peter
as
i
suppose
she
told
you
this
summer
s
venture
will
see
jimmy
and
marjorie
through
he
hesitated
and
er
college
at
last
adra
i
feel
i
have
a
right
to
say
well
that
the
only
treasure
i
ever
wanted
is
you
adra
s
blush
was
most
becoming
and
gave
philip
courage
to
go
on
could
you
possibly
care
for
me
adra
you
know
your
father
has
invited
me
into
his
office
and
i
want
to
go
on
with
my
college
education
evenings
but
somehow
whatever
i
decide
to
do
depends
on
you
if
you
care
i
think
we
can
manage
the
rest
finished
adra
calmly
though
her
heart
was
beating
fast
yes
phil
i
care
two
happy
young
people
walked
back
to
the
lodge
about
half
an
hour
later
as
phil
and
adra
entered
they
found
most
of
the
guests
gone
and
marjorie
and
jimmy
curled
up
in
big
chairs
on
the
porch
sound
asleep
those
two
wouldn
t
dare
go
to
bed
for
fear
they
d
miss
adra
and
philip
laughed
and
went
back
to
find
peter
and
penny
raiding
the
pantry
for
a
snack
ha
cried
phil
more
burglars
yes
come
join
us
replied
penny
unwrapping
some
brick
ice
cream
delighted
returned
her
brother
we
need
to
celebrate
adra
and
i
have
just
reached
a
momentous
decision
and
this
lodge
can
hardly
contain
me
big
as
it
honest
oh
adra
you
perfect
dear
and
penny
dropped
the
ice
cream
to
hug
adra
with
enthusiasm
and
peter
who
had
caught
the
ice
cream
on
his
plate
shook
hands
with
philip
after
carefully
setting
down
his
burden
you
know
said
peter
slyly
philip
was
going
to
tell
us
what
taggart
said
when
he
confessed
but
i
guess
adra
has
made
him
completely
forget
that
she
has
answered
philip
anything
else
that
happened
tonight
is
very
unimportant
by
comparison
with
this
after
all
that
s
over
exciting
enough
while
it
lasted
but
not
nearly
as
interesting
as
plans
for
my
future
life
with
listen
to
the
hero
make
little
out
of
his
great
adventure
cried
penny
phil
i
can
t
stand
it
another
minute
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
us
every
word
taggart
said
when
he
confessed
how
did
he
know
there
was
a
secret
drawer
in
the
safe
and
what
was
in
the
drawer
for
answer
peter
led
the
way
to
the
porch
wake
up
sleepy
heads
he
said
nudging
marjorie
and
jimmy
wake
up
and
hear
a
bedtime
story
about
hidden
treasure
hidden
treasure
marjorie
repeated
instantly
wide
awake
phil
you
ve
been
keeping
something
important
from
i
told
you
it
was
a
family
matter
phil
said
putting
his
arm
around
adra
and
before
i
told
the
tale
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
adra
as
well
as
peter
will
soon
be
members
of
our
i
knew
it
marjorie
cried
giving
adra
a
hug
i
told
you
so
congratulations
you
two
jimmy
said
i
mean
you
four
now
can
we
hear
what
went
on
in
the
secret
room
tonight
phil
the
story
phil
began
goes
back
to
about
twenty
years
ago
when
uncle
john
was
a
very
rich
man
and
living
in
new
york
city
at
that
time
he
invested
in
a
small
company
belonging
to
one
of
his
friends
who
told
him
that
the
stock
was
sure
to
go
up
but
the
stock
didn
t
go
up
it
went
down
and
finally
its
name
disappeared
from
the
stock
exchange
boards
and
from
the
newspaper
stock
lists
naturally
uncle
john
thought
his
certificates
were
worthless
but
lucky
for
us
he
didn
t
destroy
golly
phil
jimmy
cried
enthusiastically
when
you
say
lucky
for
us
do
you
mean
the
old
stock
is
worth
something
can
i
have
a
sailboat
after
all
phil
grinned
let
me
finish
about
five
years
ago
the
company
started
paying
dividends
but
it
couldn
t
locate
a
great
many
of
its
stockholders
among
them
uncle
john
he
had
changed
his
address
several
times
before
he
settled
down
here
so
the
company
officials
turned
the
matter
over
to
a
special
detective
agency
which
specializes
in
tracking
down
owners
of
forgotten
stocks
notices
also
appeared
in
newspapers
throughout
the
country
and
taggart
saw
one
of
the
notices
with
forged
credentials
he
got
a
job
with
the
detective
agency
and
was
assigned
the
duty
of
finding
uncle
john
guessing
that
uncle
john
was
dead
he
planned
to
get
hold
of
the
stock
certificates
and
with
more
forged
credentials
prove
that
he
was
his
sole
phil
turned
to
penny
who
was
holding
hands
with
peter
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
taggart
might
well
have
succeeded
a
girl
not
quite
so
might
have
screamed
when
she
saw
those
cowboys
drawing
real
guns
from
their
peter
squeezed
her
hand
more
tightly
i
can
t
bear
to
think
about
what
might
have
happened
if
those
gunmen
had
seen
you
darting
up
the
stop
it
both
of
you
penny
protested
blushing
get
on
with
the
story
phil
okay
phil
said
smiling
taggart
finally
traced
uncle
john
to
the
lodge
only
to
find
that
he
was
dead
and
that
we
had
started
our
business
venture
here
he
had
hoped
to
find
the
lodge
deserted
so
he
could
search
undisturbed
for
the
certificates
he
knew
that
people
leave
old
stocks
and
bonds
in
all
sorts
of
places
sometimes
they
slip
them
under
the
paper
lining
of
bureau
drawers
or
cupboards
or
between
the
pages
of
books
trunks
and
secret
drawers
in
old
safes
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
taggart
realized
that
one
of
us
while
we
were
getting
the
lodge
ready
for
guests
might
come
across
the
certificates
so
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
try
to
frighten
us
that
was
silly
of
him
marjorie
said
with
a
sniff
he
might
have
known
that
the
allens
don
t
frighten
be
quiet
imp
jimmy
said
he
didn
t
know
anything
about
us
he
added
to
philip
so
it
was
taggart
who
wrote
the
two
threatening
letters
and
left
his
footprint
on
the
ground
under
the
shed
floor
that
s
right
phil
told
him
he
confessed
that
he
wrote
the
one
to
penny
she
fell
down
the
well
and
he
also
confessed
that
he
was
our
night
prowler
actually
he
did
a
lot
of
prowling
we
didn
t
know
about
trying
to
find
out
if
his
anonymous
letters
had
any
effect
the
first
night
he
came
snooping
around
he
listened
outside
the
living
room
window
and
heard
us
joking
about
digging
in
the
well
for
buried
treasure
that
gave
him
the
idea
of
keeping
us
busy
digging
outside
instead
of
searching
around
i
can
guess
what
he
did
next
marjorie
said
with
a
rueful
laugh
he
wrote
that
note
on
an
old
piece
of
paper
put
one
half
in
the
bottle
judy
and
i
found
down
on
the
beach
and
the
other
half
in
the
pocket
of
the
old
suit
brook
found
when
the
boys
were
out
she
stopped
suddenly
her
blue
eyes
wide
with
amazement
but
how
and
when
did
he
manage
to
put
that
map
in
the
lid
of
the
costume
jewelry
box
i
can
answer
that
one
penny
said
with
a
sigh
the
day
our
first
guests
arrived
i
heard
someone
rummaging
around
in
the
storage
room
i
thought
it
was
you
marjorie
and
thought
you
were
fibbing
later
when
you
insisted
you
were
out
in
the
donahues
cabin
helping
ann
mary
count
their
she
laughed
i
owe
you
an
apology
honey
while
you
and
ann
mary
were
busy
and
phil
and
i
were
upstairs
hanging
curtains
taggart
must
have
sneaked
into
the
storage
room
and
pasted
that
map
behind
the
rotten
lining
of
the
old
jewelry
you
re
both
two
jumps
ahead
of
me
philip
said
laughing
taggart
did
put
the
map
where
you
found
it
but
first
he
had
to
have
some
excuse
for
coming
out
here
he
heard
in
the
village
that
we
were
looking
for
someone
who
would
take
the
soiled
linen
in
to
the
and
applied
to
penny
for
the
penny
moaned
covering
her
pretty
face
with
both
hands
oh
why
did
i
fall
into
his
trap
so
easily
i
should
have
guessed
when
he
offered
to
do
it
so
cheaply
that
something
was
not
at
all
peter
said
protectively
taggart
did
handle
the
laundry
situation
in
a
very
satisfactory
manner
so
i
don
t
think
anyone
can
blame
you
for
not
suspecting
him
of
an
ulterior
phil
nodded
that
s
right
penny
nobody
blames
you
the
trouble
was
that
no
one
paid
much
attention
to
him
when
he
came
out
here
i
imagine
ann
mary
didn
t
always
have
the
bundle
ready
or
his
pay
when
he
brought
out
the
clean
once
when
she
left
him
alone
in
the
kitchen
he
slipped
down
to
the
beach
and
stuck
the
bottle
containing
half
the
note
under
a
we
made
everything
so
easy
for
him
marjorie
groaned
he
was
there
in
the
kitchen
i
remember
the
day
ann
mary
suggested
that
judy
and
i
search
for
rare
shells
he
was
also
there
the
time
i
asked
her
if
it
would
be
all
right
for
us
to
spend
the
first
rainy
day
rummaging
through
the
old
trunks
in
the
storage
and
penny
added
he
knew
exactly
when
the
boys
left
on
their
camping
trip
remember
ann
mary
told
him
he
had
to
bring
back
their
clean
shirts
before
they
left
i
imagine
it
was
simple
for
him
to
find
out
from
her
where
they
were
uh
huh
phil
said
simple
ann
mary
had
no
reason
to
suspect
him
he
followed
them
to
uncle
john
s
fishing
camp
only
to
find
that
they
had
moved
deeper
into
the
woods
he
saw
the
bronc
s
tire
tracks
and
followed
them
to
the
lake
early
in
the
morning
before
brook
s
adventure
he
rigged
up
the
coat
with
the
other
half
of
the
note
in
the
pocket
he
could
count
on
the
fact
that
one
of
the
boys
while
out
canoeing
would
be
sure
to
notice
what
looked
like
the
torso
of
a
human
phil
smiled
taggart
also
knew
that
jimmy
like
marjorie
was
sure
treasure
was
buried
around
here
and
was
looking
for
and
peter
added
the
man
knew
that
no
boy
could
resist
going
through
the
pockets
of
an
old
coat
he
jimmy
s
tanned
cheeks
were
very
red
well
he
said
that
clears
up
all
the
mysterious
clues
and
letters
and
we
certainly
all
played
right
into
his
hands
when
we
issued
invitations
to
the
and
penny
added
when
i
dropped
hints
all
over
the
village
that
we
were
going
to
show
our
guests
the
secret
room
that
she
sighed
what
i
don
t
understand
is
how
taggart
knew
there
was
a
secret
drawer
in
the
because
philip
explained
staring
at
marjorie
one
day
when
he
was
out
here
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
safe
not
only
is
he
a
notorious
forger
but
in
between
sessions
in
jail
he
s
made
an
exhaustive
study
of
safes
he
knew
that
the
particular
style
and
make
of
the
one
in
the
secret
room
had
a
hidden
drawer
in
the
top
since
we
obviously
hadn
t
found
the
certificates
while
we
were
cleaning
up
the
lodge
he
guessed
that
they
might
be
in
the
secret
compartment
of
the
but
jimmy
interrupted
when
on
earth
did
he
get
a
glimpse
of
the
safe
up
until
tonight
i
mean
last
night
nobody
but
you
and
pat
ever
went
into
the
secret
room
and
i
m
sure
neither
of
you
was
careless
enough
to
open
the
door
unless
you
were
sure
no
one
was
lurking
it
was
now
marjorie
s
turn
to
cover
her
red
cheeks
with
both
hands
i
can
answer
that
one
she
confessed
miserably
one
day
when
taggart
was
here
i
showed
judy
how
the
door
opened
he
must
have
been
hiding
in
the
alcove
when
the
bookshelves
moved
back
i
heard
someone
moving
down
the
hall
just
before
we
left
and
thought
it
was
ann
mary
with
a
bundle
of
soiled
laundry
but
i
guess
there
s
no
doubt
that
it
was
she
raised
her
face
on
the
verge
of
tears
thinking
back
i
remember
now
that
he
was
in
the
kitchen
and
judy
and
i
had
just
left
there
when
she
begged
me
to
show
her
how
the
secret
door
worked
oh
she
finished
how
can
i
be
so
dumb
tain
t
easy
jimmy
said
grinning
you
ve
got
to
have
a
lot
of
practice
before
you
can
be
as
hopeless
as
you
are
never
mind
honey
penny
said
to
marjorie
in
a
comforting
voice
after
all
in
a
way
you
helped
to
set
the
trap
that
caught
she
turned
to
philip
we
re
all
trying
to
tell
your
story
for
you
and
i
for
one
am
getting
confused
once
taggart
got
a
glimpse
of
the
safe
and
knew
how
to
get
into
the
secret
room
why
did
he
wait
until
the
masquerade
to
go
in
there
phil
chuckled
because
he
didn
t
know
the
combination
of
the
safe
he
could
of
course
have
sneaked
out
here
at
night
after
we
d
all
gone
to
bed
and
used
dynamite
to
open
the
safe
but
that
would
have
been
pretty
risky
soon
after
he
saw
the
safe
and
the
room
we
issued
blanket
invitations
to
the
masquerade
and
you
slyly
hinted
that
part
of
the
evening
s
entertainment
would
be
a
visit
to
the
secret
room
taggart
promptly
decided
that
the
safest
way
of
getting
what
he
wanted
was
to
let
us
lead
him
right
to
in
other
words
peter
added
while
we
were
setting
our
little
trap
x
was
setting
one
of
his
own
while
his
gangster
friends
were
holding
up
the
rest
of
the
party
he
planned
to
force
one
of
you
allens
to
accompany
him
into
the
secret
room
and
open
the
that
s
right
philip
said
and
i
made
things
easy
for
him
when
i
asked
him
to
lend
atmosphere
by
posing
by
the
safe
and
then
to
cap
the
climax
i
stayed
behind
after
everyone
else
had
left
the
only
thing
i
can
say
for
myself
he
finished
is
that
i
did
have
the
presence
of
mind
to
close
the
door
as
soon
as
i
realized
i
d
walked
into
the
trap
we
had
set
for
him
and
even
that
he
admitted
was
sort
of
a
reflex
call
it
what
you
like
jimmy
said
but
it
was
important
otherwise
taggart
would
have
heard
the
outraged
cries
of
his
gunmen
when
they
walked
into
the
arms
of
the
police
during
that
commotion
he
might
have
escaped
with
the
real
he
leaned
forward
to
tap
phil
s
knee
now
that
we
ve
all
with
the
exception
of
the
confessed
to
being
dimwits
in
one
way
or
another
let
s
hear
more
about
those
stock
certificates
phil
answer
me
yes
or
no
are
they
worth
enough
so
i
can
get
a
sailboat
chapter
happy
ending
i
object
peter
cried
my
isn
t
a
dimwit
she
s
a
i
object
too
adra
said
phil
s
a
all
right
all
right
jimmy
said
but
it
s
getting
on
toward
dawn
marjorie
and
i
are
dimwits
just
tell
me
whether
or
not
we
re
rich
or
we
re
rich
philip
said
as
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
bulging
envelope
he
had
earlier
been
forced
to
hand
over
to
taggart
he
handed
it
to
penny
open
it
her
hands
shaking
with
excitement
penny
lifted
the
flap
and
pulled
out
a
wad
of
yellowed
stock
certificates
those
ancient
documents
phil
told
her
quietly
don
t
look
like
much
but
according
to
taggart
s
confession
when
we
turn
them
in
we
ll
collect
about
their
cash
value
plus
back
dividends
and
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
then
jimmy
yelled
whoopee
the
hidden
treasure
is
found
at
last
and
boy
oh
boy
will
i
ever
get
the
finest
sailboat
that
was
ever
launched
i
can
t
believe
it
marjorie
said
in
an
awed
voice
why
i
i
m
an
heiress
can
believe
it
peter
said
pretending
to
be
mournful
penny
will
never
marry
poor
penniless
me
of
course
not
penny
said
with
a
laugh
and
now
phil
doesn
t
have
to
marry
adra
for
her
money
everyone
laughed
then
almost
hysterically
they
were
all
tired
and
dawn
was
pinking
the
sky
in
the
east
if
you
ask
me
jimmy
said
stretching
and
yawning
i
d
say
we
all
ought
to
catch
a
little
i
for
one
won
t
believe
any
part
of
phil
s
yarn
until
i
hear
it
all
over
again
in
broad
but
the
next
morning
after
consulting
the
older
men
who
were
staying
at
the
lodge
the
allens
learned
that
the
old
stock
certificates
were
worth
even
more
than
taggart
had
estimated
i
know
the
company
well
curtis
told
phil
bought
stock
in
it
myself
a
few
years
ago
when
it
got
a
government
loan
and
staged
a
and
then
to
the
delight
of
everyone
adra
s
father
prentice
arrived
by
plane
they
were
all
eager
for
the
advice
of
such
an
experienced
businessman
i
wouldn
t
sell
he
said
after
hearing
the
whole
story
you
couldn
t
invest
your
money
in
a
safer
concern
when
you
collect
your
back
dividends
you
ll
each
have
a
tidy
sum
if
you
need
cash
now
if
not
i
would
reinvest
that
money
and
thus
provide
yourselves
with
a
comfortable
yearly
income
from
it
and
the
original
he
smiled
at
them
i
ll
handle
the
whole
matter
for
you
if
you
please
do
penny
cried
oh
it
s
all
so
wonderful
peter
and
i
can
get
married
right
away
and
marjorie
and
jimmy
are
assured
of
college
what
about
us
philip
crossed
over
to
stand
beside
adra
who
was
perched
on
the
arm
of
her
father
s
chair
sir
he
said
with
formality

done
me
the
honor
of
promising
to

my
wife
with
your
permission
we
would
like
to
be
married
sometime
this
marjorie
could
not
suppress
a
giggle
phil
did
look
as
though
he
ought
to
be
wearing
a
prince
albert
coat
instead
of
a
sports
jacket
and
slacks
prentice
stood
up
to
shake
hands
gravely
with
philip
you
have
my
permission
sir
he
said
a
smile
twitching
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
my
peter
grabbed
penny

hand

let
s
celebrate
no
more

for
their
departures
phil
and
penny
had
to
be
everywhere

once
to
help
them

and
ship

their
luggage
or
to

a
bottle
of
champagne
that
he
claimed

another
special
occasion
ugh
marjorie
spluttered
after
one
sip
what
horrible
tasting
stuff
jimmy
judy
and
alf
heartily
agreed
with
her
and
gratefully
accepted
the
ginger
ale

substituted
for

bubbling

allen
much
a
few
days
later
on
a
beautiful
bright
september
morning
the
wedding
took

and
judy
were
so
excited
they
couldn
t
fasten
the
zippers
on
their
crisp
organdie
frocks
penny
sweetly
serene
came
to
the
rescue
wearing
her
lovely
flowing
gown
of
white
tulle
over
taffeta
marjorie
finally
conquered
her
nervousness
long
enough
to
pin
on
the
clusters
of
orange
blossoms
which
held
penny
s
lace
veil
in
place
then
carrying
pat
s
enormous
bridal
bouquet
of
white
chrysanthemums
penny
came
from
the
house
on
philip
s
arm
to
join
peter
under
the
trees

held
her
breath
while

and
peter
made
their
vows
in
clear
steady
voices
after
the
ceremony
was
over

the
first
to
congratulate
the
bridegroom

marjorie

first
to

her
sister
