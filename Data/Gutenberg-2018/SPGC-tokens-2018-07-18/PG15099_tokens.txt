this
edition
is
inscribed
to
the
memory
of
james
russell
lowell
whose
cordial
encouragement
to
my
early
studies
of
american
dialect
is
gratefully
remembered
the
author
preface
to
the
library
edition
being
the
history
of
a
story
the
hoosier
was
written
and
printed
in
the
autumn
of
it
is
therefore
now
about
years
old
and
the
publishers
propose
to
mark
its
coming
of
age
by
issuing
a
library
edition
i
avail
myself
of
the
occasion
to
make
some
needed
revisions
and
to
preface
the
new
edition
with
an
account
of
the
origin
and
adventures
of
the
book
if
i
should
seem
to
betray
unbecoming
pride
in
speaking
of
a
story
that
has
passed
into
several
languages
and
maintained
an
undiminished
popularity
for
more
than
a
score
of
years
i
count
on
receiving
the
indulgence
commonly
granted
to
paternal
vanity
when
celebrating
the
majority
of
a
with
all
its
faults
on
its
head
this
little
tale
has
become
a
classic
in
the
bookseller
sense
at
least
and
a
public
that
has
shown
so
constant
a
partiality
for
it
has
a
right
to
feel
some
curiosity
regarding
its
history
i
persuade
myself
that
additional
extenuation
for
this
biography
of
a
book
is
to
be
found
in
the
relation
which
the
hoosier
happens
to
bear
to
the
most
significant
movement
in
american
literature
in
our
generation
it
is
the
of
the
procession
of
american
dialect
novels
before
the
appearance
of
this
story
the
new
england
had
long
been
employed
for
various
literary
purposes
it
is
true
and
after
its
use
by
lowell
it
had
acquired
a
standing
that
made
it
the
classic
of
the
united
states
even
hoosiers
and
southerners
when
put
into
print
as
they
sometimes
were
in
rude
burlesque
stories
usually
talked
about
huskin
bees
and
bees
and
used
many
other
expressions
foreign
to
their
vernacular
american
literature
hardly
touched
the
speech
and
life
of
the
people
outside
of
new
england
in
other
words
it
was
provincial
in
the
narrow
sense
i
can
hardly
suppose
that
the
hoosier
bore
any
causative
relation
to
that
broader
provincial
movement
in
our
literature
which
now
includes
such
remarkable
productions
as
the
writings
of
cable
harris
mr
page
miss
murfree
richard
malcom
johnson
howe
garland
some
of
burnett
stories
and
others
quite
worthy
of
inclusion
in
this
list
the
taking
up
of
life
in
this
regional
way
has
made
our
literature
really
national
by
the
only
process
possible
the
federal
nation
has
at
length
manifested
a
consciousness
of
the
continental
diversity
of
its
forms
of
life
the
great
american
novel
for
which
prophetic
critics
yearned
so
fondly
twenty
years
ago
is
appearing
in
sections
i
may
claim
for
this
book
the
distinction
such
as
it
is
of
being
the
first
of
the
dialect
stories
that
depict
a
life
quite
beyond
new
england
influence
some
of
bret
harte
brief
and
powerful
tales
had
already
foreshadowed
this
movement
toward
a
larger
rendering
of
our
life
but
the
romantic
character
of
delightful
stories
and
the
absence
of
anything
that
can
justly
be
called
dialect
in
them
mark
them
as
rather
forerunners
than
beginners
of
the
prevailing
school
for
some
years
after
the
appearance
of
the
present
novel
my
own
stories
had
to
themselves
the
field
of
provincial
realism
if
indeed
there
be
any
such
thing
as
realism
before
there
came
the
succession
of
fine
productions
which
have
made
the
last
fourteen
years
notable
though
it
had
often
occurred
to
me
to
write
something
in
the
dialect
now
known
as
hoosier
the
of
the
southern
part
of
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
of
forty
years
ago
i
had
postponed
the
attempt
indefinitely
probably
because
the
only
literary
use
that
had
been
made
of
the
allied
speech
of
the
southwest
had
been
in
the
books
of
the
primitive
humorists
of
that
region
i
found
it
hard
to
dissociate
in
my
own
mind
the
dialect
from
the
somewhat
coarse
boisterousness
which
seemed
inseparable
from
it
in
the
works
of
these
rollicking
writers
it
chanced
that
in
taine
lectures
on
art
in
the
netherlands
or
rather
john
durand
translation
of
them
fell
into
my
hands
as
a
book
for
editorial
review
these
discourses
are
little
else
than
an
elucidation
of
the
thesis
that
the
artist
of
originality
will
work
courageously
with
the
materials
he
finds
in
his
own
environment
in
taine
view
all
life
has
matter
for
the
artist
if
only
he
have
eyes
to
see
many
years
previous
to
the
time
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
while
i
was
yet
a
young
man
i
had
projected
a
lecture
on
the
hoosier
and
had
even
printed
during
the
war
a
little
political
skit
in
that
dialect
in
a
paul
paper
so
far
as
i
know
nothing
else
had
ever
been
printed
in
the
hoosier
under
the
spur
of
taine
argument
i
now
proceeded
to
write
a
short
story
wholly
in
the
dialect
spoken
in
my
childhood
by
rustics
on
the
north
side
of
the
ohio
river
this
tale
i
called
the
hoosier
it
consisted
almost
entirely
of
an
autobiographical
narration
in
dialect
by
mirandy
means
of
the
incidents
that
form
the
groundwork
of
the
present
story
i
was
the
newly
installed
editor
of
a
weekly
journal
and
and
i
sent
this
little
story
in
a
new
dialect
to
my
printer
it
chanced
that
one
of
the
proprietors
of
the
paper
saw
a
part
of
it
in
proof
he
urged
me
to
take
it
back
and
make
a
longer
story
out
of
the
materials
and
he
expressed
great
confidence
in
the
success
of
such
a
story
yielding
to
his
suggestion
i
began
to
write
this
novel
from
week
to
week
as
it
appeared
in
the
paper
and
thus
found
myself
involved
in
the
career
of
a
novelist
which
had
up
to
that
time
formed
no
part
of
my
plan
of
life
in
my
inexperience
i
worked
at
a
completing
the
book
in
ten
weeks
long
before
these
weeks
of
eager
toil
were
over
it
was
a
question
among
my
friends
whether
the
novel
might
not
write
to
me
before
i
should
see
the
end
of
it
the
sole
purpose
i
had
in
view
at
first
was
the
resuscitation
of
the
newspaper
of
which
i
had
ventured
to
take
charge
one
of
the
firm
of
publishers
thought
much
less
favorably
of
my
story
than
his
partner
did
i
was
called
into
the
private
office
and
informed
with
some
severity
that
my
characters
were
too
rough
to
be
presentable
in
a
paper
so
refined
as
ours
i
confess
they
did
seem
somewhat
too
robust
for
a
sheet
so
an√¶mic
as
and
had
been
in
the
months
just
preceding
but
when
the
very
next
week
after
this
protest
was
made
the
circulation
of
the
paper
increased
some
thousands
at
a
bound
my
employer
critical
estimate
of
the
work
underwent
a
rapid
change
a
change
based
on
what
seemed
to
him
better
than
merely
literary
considerations
by
the
time
the
story
closed
at
the
end
of
fourteen
instalments
the
subscription
list
had
multiplied
itself
four
or
five
fold
it
is
only
fair
to
admit
however
that
the
original
multiplicand
had
been
rather
small
papers
in
canada
and
in
some
of
the
other
english
colonies
transferred
the
novel
bodily
to
their
columns
and
many
of
the
american
country
papers
helped
themselves
to
it
quite
freely
it
had
run
some
weeks
of
its
course
before
it
occurred
to
any
one
that
it
might
profitably
be
reprinted
in
book
form
the
publishers
were
loath
to
risk
much
in
the
venture
the
newspaper
type
was
rejustified
to
make
a
book
page
and
barely
two
thousand
copies
were
printed
for
a
first
edition
i
remember
expressing
the
opinion
that
the
number
was
too
large
the
hoosier
was
pirated
with
the
utmost
promptitude
by
the
routledge
in
england
for
that
was
in
the
barbarous
days
before
international
copyright
when
english
publishers
complained
of
the
unscrupulousness
of
american
reprinters
while
they
themselves
pounced
upon
every
line
of
american
production
that
promised
some
shillings
of
profit
the
hoosier
was
brought
out
in
england
in
a
cheap
sensational
form
the
edition
of
ten
thousand
has
long
been
out
of
print
for
this
large
edition
and
for
the
editions
issued
in
the
british
colonies
and
in
continental
europe
i
have
never
received
a
penny
a
great
many
men
have
made
money
out
of
the
book
but
my
own
returns
have
been
comparatively
small
for
its
use
in
serial
form
i
received
nothing
beyond
my
salary
as
editor
on
the
copyright
edition
i
have
received
the
moderate
royalty
allowed
to
young
authors
at
the
outset
of
their
work
the
sale
of
the
american
edition
in
the
first
twenty
years
amounted
to
seventy
thousand
copies
the
peculiarity
of
this
sale
is
its
steadiness
after
twenty
years
the
hoosier
is
selling
at
the
average
rate
of
more
than
three
thousand
copies
per
annum
during
the
last
years
the
popularity
of
the
book
has
apparently
increased
and
its
twentieth
year
closed
with
a
sale
of
hundred
in
six
months
only
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
book
trade
and
who
know
how
brief
is
the
life
of
the
average
novel
will
understand
how
exceptional
is
this
popularity
some
of
the
newspaper
reviewers
of
twenty
years
ago
were
a
little
puzzled
to
know
what
to
make
of
a
book
in
so
questionable
a
shape
for
the
american
dialect
novel
was
then
a
but
nothing
could
have
given
a
beginner
more
genuine
pleasure
than
the
cordial
commendation
of
the
leading
professional
critic
of
the
time
the
late
george
ripley
who
wrote
an
extended
review
of
this
book
for
the
the
monthly
magazines
all
spoke
of
the
hoosier
in
terms
as
favorable
as
it
deserved
i
can
not
pretend
that
i
was
content
with
these
notices
at
the
time
for
i
had
the
sensitiveness
of
a
beginner
but
on
looking
at
the
reviews
in
the
magazines
of
that
day
i
am
amused
to
find
that
the
faults
pointed
out
in
the
work
of
my
prentice
hand
are
just
those
that
i
should
be
disposed
to
complain
of
now
if
it
were
any
part
of
my
business
to
tell
the
reader
wherein
i
might
have
done
better
then
in
its
youth
honored
the
hoosier
by
giving
it
two
pages
mostly
in
discussion
of
its
dialect
but
dispensing
paradoxical
praise
and
censure
in
that
condescending
way
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
enough
according
to
its
critic
the
author
had
understood
and
described
the
old
western
life
but
he
had
done
it
quite
sketchily
to
be
sure
yet
it
was
done
with
essential
truth
and
some
effectiveness
the
critic
however
instantly
stands
on
the
other
foot
again
and
adds
that
the
book
is
not
a
captivating
one
but
he
makes
amends
in
the
very
next
sentence
by
an
allusion
to
the
faithfulness
of
its
transcript
of
the
life
it
depicts
and
then
instantly
balances
the
account
on
the
adverse
side
of
the
ledger
by
assuring
the
reader
that
it
has
no
interest
of
passion
or
mental
power
but
even
this
fatal
conclusion
is
diluted
by
a
dependent
clause
possibly
says
the
reviewer
the
good
feeling
of
the
intertwined
love
story
may
conciliate
the
of
some
of
the
malcontent
one
could
hardly
carry
further
the
fine
art
of
oscillating
between
moderate
commendation
and
parenthetical
damnation
an
art
that
lends
a
factitious
air
of
judicial
impartiality
and
mental
equipoise
beyond
question
is
one
of
the
ablest
weekly
papers
in
the
world
the
admirable
scholarship
of
its
articles
and
reviews
in
departments
of
special
knowledge
might
well
be
a
subject
of
pride
to
any
american
but
its
inadequate
reviews
of
current
fiction
add
nothing
to
its
value
and
its
habitual
tone
of
condescending
depreciation
in
treating
imaginative
literature
of
indigenous
origin
is
one
of
the
strongest
discouragements
to
literary
production
the
main
value
of
good
criticism
lies
in
its
readiness
and
penetration
in
discovering
and
applauding
merit
not
before
recognized
or
imperfectly
recognized
this
is
a
conspicuous
trait
of
the
greatest
of
all
newspaper
critics
he
knew
how
to
be
severe
upon
occasion
but
he
saw
talent
in
advance
of
the
public
and
dispensed
encouragement
heartily
so
that
he
made
himself
almost
a
to
the
literature
of
his
generation
in
france
but
there
is
a
class
of
anonymous
reviewers
in
england
and
america
who
seem
to
hold
a
traditional
theory
that
the
function
of
a
critic
toward
talent
is
analogous
to
that
of
pharaoh
toward
the
infant
jewish
population
during
the
first
year
after
its
publication
the
hoosier
was
translated
into
french
and
published
in
a
condensed
form
in
the
des
deux
the
translator
was
the
writer
who
signs
the
name
th
bentzon
and
who
is
well
known
to
be
madame
blanc
this
french
version
afterward
appeared
in
book
form
in
the
same
volume
with
one
of
thomas
bailey
aldrich
stories
and
some
other
stories
of
mine
in
this
latter
shape
i
have
never
seen
it
the
title
given
to
the
story
by
madame
blanc
was
le
ma√Ætre
de
flat
creek
it
may
be
imagined
that
the
translator
found
it
no
easy
task
to
get
equivalents
in
french
for
expressions
in
a
dialect
new
and
strange
i
be
appears
in
french
as
devil
take
me
which
is
not
bad
the
devil
being
rather
a
jolly
sort
of
fellow
in
french
the
church
of
the
best
licks
seems
rather
unrenderable
and
i
do
not
see
how
the
translator
could
have
found
a
better
phrase
for
it
than
des
though
does
not
convey
the
double
sense
of
licks
epelait
vite
comme
is
not
a
good
rendering
of
jim
spelled
like
lightning
since
it
is
not
the
celerity
of
the
spelling
that
is
the
main
consideration
is
probably
the
best
equivalent
for
but
it
seems
something
more
stately
in
its
french
dress
when
bud
says
with
reference
to
hannah
i
never
took
no
shine
that
air
way
the
phrase
is
rather
too
idiomatic
for
the
french
tongue
and
it
becomes
i
have
run
after
that
hare
pas
chass√©
ce
perhaps
the
most
sadly
amusing
thing
in
the
translation
is
the
way
the
meaning
of
the
nickname
shocky
is
missed
in
an
explanatory
it
is
according
to
the
translator
an
abbreviation
or
corruption
of
the
english
word
shocking
which
expresses
the
shocking
ugliness
of
the
child
exprime
la
laideur
choquante
de
a
german
version
of
the
hoosier
was
made
about
the
time
of
the
appearance
of
the
french
translation
but
of
this
i
have
never
seen
a
copy
i
know
of
it
only
from
the
statement
made
to
me
by
a
german
professor
that
he
had
read
it
in
german
before
he
knew
any
english
what
are
the
equivalents
in
high
german
for
right
smart
and
i
can
not
imagine
several
years
after
the
publication
of
the
hoosier
it
occurred
to
hansen
of
kj√∂ge
in
denmark
to
render
it
into
danish
among
the
danes
the
book
enjoyed
a
popularity
as
great
perhaps
as
it
has
had
at
home
the
circulation
warranted
hansen
and
his
publisher
in
bringing
out
several
other
novels
of
mine
the
danish
translator
was
the
only
person
concerned
in
the
various
foreign
editions
of
this
book
who
had
the
courtesy
to
ask
the
author
leave
under
the
old
conditions
in
regard
to
international
copyright
an
author
came
to
be
regarded
as
one
not
entitled
even
to
common
civilities
in
the
matter
of
reprinting
his
works
he
was
to
be
plundered
without
politeness
as
i
look
at
the
row
of
my
books
in
the
unfamiliar
danish
i
am
reminded
of
that
new
england
mother
who
on
recovering
her
children
carried
away
by
the
canadian
indians
found
it
impossible
to
communicate
with
a
daughter
who
spoke
only
french
and
a
son
who
knew
nothing
but
the
speech
of
his
savage
captors
hansen
was
thoughtful
enough
to
send
me
the
reviews
of
my
books
in
the
danish
newspapers
and
he
had
the
double
kindness
to
translate
these
into
english
and
to
leave
out
all
but
those
that
were
likely
to
be
agreeable
to
my
vanity
of
these
i
remember
but
a
single
sentence
and
that
because
it
was
expressed
with
felicity
the
reviewer
said
of
the
fun
in
the
hoosier
this
is
humor
laughing
to
keep
from
bursting
into
tears
a
year
or
two
before
the
appearance
of
the
hoosier
a
newspaper
article
of
mine
touching
upon
american
dialect
interested
lowell
and
he
urged
me
to
look
for
the
foreign
influence
that
has
affected
the
speech
of
the
ohio
river
country
my
reverence
for
him
as
the
master
in
such
studies
did
not
prevent
me
from
feeling
that
the
suggestion
was
a
little
absurd
but
at
a
later
period
i
became
aware
that
north
irishmen
used
many
of
the
pronunciations
and
idioms
that
distinctly
characterized
the
language
of
people
on
the
ohio
many
ulster
men
say
wair
for
were
and
air
for
are
for
example
connecting
this
with
the
existence
of
a
considerable
element
of
names
in
the
ohio
river
region
i
could
not
doubt
that
here
was
one
of
the
keys
the
master
had
bidden
me
look
for
while
pursuing
at
a
later
period
a
series
of
investigations
into
the
of
the
american
people
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
i
became
much
interested
in
the
emigration
to
america
from
the
north
of
ireland
a
movement
that
waxed
and
waned
as
the
great
industry
of
the
last
century
declined
or
prospered
the
first
american
home
of
these
irish
was
pennsylvania
a
portion
of
them
were
people
who
in
course
of
time
made
themselves
felt
in
the
commerce
politics
and
intellectual
life
of
the
nation
there
was
also
a
element
descended
perhaps
from
those
rude
borderers
who
were
deported
to
ireland
more
for
the
sake
of
the
peace
of
north
britain
than
for
the
benefit
of
ireland
in
this
rougher
class
there
was
perhaps
a
larger
dash
of
the
celtic
fire
that
came
from
the
wild
irish
women
whom
the
first
scotch
settlers
in
ulster
made
the
mothers
of
their
progeny
arrived
in
the
wilds
of
pennsylvania
these
irishmen
built
rude
cabins
planted
little
patches
of
corn
and
potatoes
and
distilled
a
whiskey
that
was
never
suffered
to
grow
mellow
the
forest
was
congenial
to
men
who
spent
much
the
larger
part
of
their
time
in
boisterous
sport
of
one
sort
or
another
the
manufacture
of
the
rifle
was
early
brought
to
lancaster
in
pennsylvania
direct
from
the
land
of
its
invention
by
swiss
emigrants
and
in
the
adventurous
of
the
pennsylvania
frontier
the
rifle
found
its
fellow
irish
settlers
became
hunters
of
wild
beasts
explorers
pioneers
and
warriors
against
the
indians
upon
whom
they
avenged
their
wrongs
with
relentless
ferocity
both
the
irish
race
and
the
intermingled
pennsylvania
dutch
were
prolific
and
the
of
pennsylvania
soon
overflowed
emigration
was
held
in
check
to
the
westward
for
a
while
by
the
cruel
massacres
of
the
french
and
indian
wars
and
one
river
of
population
poured
itself
southward
into
the
fertile
valleys
of
the
virginia
mountain
country
another
and
larger
flood
swept
still
farther
to
the
south
along
the
eastern
borders
of
the
appalachian
range
until
it
reached
the
uplands
of
carolina
when
the
militia
of
one
county
in
south
carolina
was
mustered
during
the
revolution
it
was
found
that
every
one
of
the
hundred
men
enrolled
were
natives
of
pennsylvania
these
were
mainly
sons
of
north
irishmen
and
from
the
carolina
irish
sprang
calhoun
the
most
aggressive
statesman
that
has
appeared
in
america
and
jackson
the
most
brilliant
military
genius
in
the
whole
course
of
our
history
before
the
close
of
the
revolution
this
adventurous
race
had
begun
to
break
over
the
passes
of
the
alleghanies
into
the
dark
and
bloody
ground
of
kentucky
and
tennessee
soon
afterward
a
multitude
of
pennsylvanians
of
all
stocks
the
and
those
germans
swiss
and
hollanders
who
are
commonly
classed
together
as
the
pennsylvania
dutch
as
well
as
a
large
number
of
people
of
english
descent
began
to
migrate
down
the
ohio
valley
along
with
them
came
professional
men
and
people
of
more
or
less
culture
chiefly
from
eastern
virginia
and
maryland
there
came
also
into
indiana
and
illinois
from
the
border
states
and
from
as
far
south
as
north
carolina
and
tennessee
a
body
of
poor
whites
these
people
descendants
of
the
colonial
formed
in
the
second
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
lowest
rank
of
hoosiers
but
as
early
as
there
was
a
considerable
exodus
of
these
to
missouri
from
pike
county
in
that
state
they
wended
their
way
to
california
to
appear
in
bret
harte
stories
as
pikes
the
movement
of
this
class
out
of
indiana
went
on
with
augmented
volume
in
the
fifties
the
emigrants
of
this
period
mostly
sought
the
states
lying
just
west
of
the
mississippi
and
the
poorer
sort
made
the
trip
in
little
wagons
of
the
sorriest
description
laden
mainly
with
children
and
followed
by
the
yellow
curs
that
are
the
one
luxury
indispensable
to
a
family
of
this
class
to
this
migration
and
to
a
liberal
provision
for
popular
education
indiana
owes
a
great
improvement
in
the
average
intelligence
of
her
people
as
early
as
i
believe
the
state
had
come
to
rank
with
some
of
the
new
england
states
in
the
matter
of
literacy
the
of
the
ohio
river
country
has
many
features
in
common
with
that
of
the
eastern
middle
states
while
it
received
but
little
from
the
dignified
english
of
eastern
virginia
there
are
distinct
traces
of
the
in
the
idioms
and
in
the
peculiar
pronunciations
one
finds
also
here
and
there
a
word
from
the
pennsylvania
dutch
such
as
waumus
for
a
loose
jacket
from
the
german
a
doublet
and
smearcase
for
cottage
cheese
from
the
german
the
only
french
word
left
by
the
old
so
far
as
i
now
remember
is
cordelle
to
tow
a
boat
by
a
rope
carried
along
the
shore
substantially
the
same
exists
wherever
the
pennsylvania
migration
formed
the
main
element
of
the
primitive
settlement
i
have
heard
the
same
dialect
in
the
south
carolina
uplands
that
one
gets
from
a
posey
county
hoosier
or
rather
that
one
used
to
get
in
the
old
days
before
the
vandal
had
reduced
the
vulgar
tongue
to
the
monotonous
propriety
of
what
we
call
good
english
in
drawing
some
of
the
subordinate
characters
in
this
tale
a
little
too
baldly
from
the
model
i
fell
into
an
error
common
to
inexperienced
writers
it
is
amusing
to
observe
that
these
portrait
characters
seem
the
least
substantial
of
all
the
figures
in
the
book
small
is
a
rather
unrealistic
villain
but
i
knew
him
well
and
respected
him
in
my
boyish
heart
for
a
most
exemplary
christian
of
good
family
at
the
very
time
that
according
to
testimony
afterward
given
he
was
diversifying
his
pursuits
as
a
practising
physician
by
leading
a
gang
of
burglars
more
than
one
person
has
been
pointed
out
as
the
original
of
bud
means
and
i
believe
there
are
one
or
two
men
each
of
whom
flatters
himself
that
he
posed
for
the
figure
of
the
first
disciple
of
the
church
of
the
best
licks
bud
is
made
up
of
elements
found
in
some
of
his
race
but
not
in
any
one
man
not
dreaming
that
the
story
would
reach
beyond
the
small
circulation
of
and
i
used
the
names
of
people
in
switzerland
and
decatur
counties
in
indiana
almost
without
being
aware
of
it
i
have
heard
that
a
young
man
bearing
the
surname
given
to
one
of
the
rudest
families
in
this
book
had
to
suffer
many
gibes
while
a
student
at
an
indiana
college
i
here
do
public
penance
for
my
culpable
indiscretion
jeems
phillips
name
and
all
is
a
real
person
whom
at
the
time
of
writing
this
story
i
had
not
seen
since
i
was
a
lad
of
nine
and
he
a
man
of
nearly
forty
he
was
a
mere
memory
to
me
and
was
put
into
the
book
with
some
slighting
remarks
which
the
real
jeems
did
not
deserve
i
did
not
know
that
he
was
living
and
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
the
story
would
have
vitality
enough
to
travel
all
the
way
to
indiana
but
the
portion
referring
to
phillips
was
transferred
to
the
county
paper
circulating
among
jeems
neighbors
for
once
the
man
was
as
they
say
in
hoosier
mad
and
he
threatened
to
thrash
the
editor
do
you
think
he
means
you
demanded
the
editor
to
be
sure
he
does
said
the
champion
speller
can
you
spell
i
can
spell
down
any
master
that
ever
came
to
our
district
he
replied
as
time
passed
on
phillips
found
himself
a
lion
strangers
desired
an
introduction
to
him
as
a
notability
and
invited
the
champion
to
dissipate
with
them
at
the
soda
fountain
in
the
village
drug
store
it
became
a
matter
of
pride
with
him
that
he
was
the
most
famous
speller
in
the
world
two
years
ago
while
visiting
the
town
of
my
nativity
i
met
upon
the
street
the
aged
jeems
phillips
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
more
than
forty
years
i
would
go
far
to
hear
him
spell
down
a
complacent
once
more
the
publication
of
this
book
gave
rise
to
an
amusing
revival
of
the
as
a
means
of
public
entertainment
not
in
rustic
regions
alone
but
in
towns
also
the
furor
extended
to
the
great
cities
of
new
york
and
london
and
reached
at
last
to
farthest
australia
spreading
to
every
region
in
which
english
is
spelled
or
spoken
but
the
effect
of
the
chapter
on
the
was
temporary
and
superficial
the
only
organization
that
came
from
the
mania
so
far
as
i
know
was
an
association
of
in
london
to
discuss
mooted
points
the
sketch
of
the
church
of
the
best
licks
however
seems
to
have
made
a
deep
and
enduring
impression
upon
individuals
and
to
have
left
some
organized
results
i
myself
endeavored
to
realize
it
and
for
five
years
i
was
the
pastor
of
a
church
in
brooklyn
organized
on
a
basis
almost
as
simple
as
that
in
the
flat
creek
the
name
i
rendered
into
respectable
english
and
the
church
of
the
best
licks
became
the
church
of
christian
endeavor
it
was
highly
successful
in
doing
that
which
a
church
ought
to
do
and
its
methods
of
work
have
been
widely
copied
after
my
work
as
a
minister
had
been
definitely
closed
the
name
and
the
underlying
thought
of
this
church
were
borrowed
for
a
young
people
society
and
thus
the
little
story
of
good
endeavor
in
indiana
seems
to
have
left
a
permanent
mark
on
the
ecclesiastical
organization
of
the
time
if
any
one
judging
by
the
length
of
this
preface
should
conclude
that
i
hold
my
little
book
in
undue
esteem
let
him
know
that
i
owe
it
more
than
one
grudge
it
is
said
that
thomas
campbell
twenty
years
after
the
appearance
of
his
poem
was
one
day
introduced
as
the
author
of
pleasures
of
hope
confound
pleasures
of
hope
he
protested
ca
i
write
anything
else
so
however
much
i
may
prefer
my
later
work
more
carefully
wrought
in
respect
of
thought
structure
and
style
this
initial
novel
the
favorite
of
the
larger
public
has
become
inseparably
associated
with
my
name
often
i
have
mentally
applied
campbell
imprecation
on
the
pleasures
of
hope
to
this
story
i
could
not
write
in
this
vein
now
if
i
would
and
years
have
made
so
many
changes
in
me
that
i
dare
not
make
any
but
minor
changes
in
this
novel
the
author
of
the
hoosier
is
distinctly
not
i
i
am
but
his
heir
and
executor
and
since
he
is
a
more
popular
writer
than
i
why
should
i
meddle
with
his
work
i
have
however
ventured
to
make
some
necessary
revision
of
the
diction
and
have
added
notes
mostly
with
reference
to
the
dialect
a
second
grudge
against
this
story
is
that
somehow
its
readers
persist
in
believing
it
to
be
a
bit
of
my
own
life
americans
are
credulous
believers
in
that
miracle
of
the
imagination
whom
no
one
has
ever
seen
in
the
flesh
the
man
some
readers
of
the
hoosier
have
settled
it
for
a
certainty
that
the
author
sprang
from
the
rustic
class
he
has
described
one
lady
even
wrote
to
inquire
whether
my
childhood
were
not
represented
in
shocky
the
little
lad
out
of
the
a
biographical
sketch
of
me
in
italian
goes
so
far
as
to
state
that
among
the
hard
resorts
by
which
i
made
a
living
in
my
early
life
was
the
teaching
of
a
in
chicago
no
one
knows
so
well
as
i
the
faults
of
immaturity
and
inexperience
that
characterize
this
book
but
perhaps
after
all
the
public
is
right
in
so
often
preferring
an
author
first
book
there
is
what
emerson
would
have
called
a
central
spontaneity
about
the
work
of
a
young
man
that
may
give
more
delight
to
the
reader
than
all
the
precision
of
thought
and
perfection
of
style
for
which
we
strive
as
life
advances

since
writing
the
passage
in
the
text
i
have
met
with
the
following
in
of
london
everybody
knows
that
when
an
important
work
is
published
in
history
philosophy
or
any
branch
of
science
the
editor
of
a
respectable
paper
employs
an
expert
to
review
it
indeed
the
more
abstruse
the
subject
of
the
book
the
more
careful
and
intelligent
you
will
find
the
review
it
is
equally
well
known
that
works
of
fiction
and
books
of
verse
are
not
treated
with
anything
like
the
same
care
a
good
poem
play
or
novel
is
at
least
as
fine
an
achievement
as
a
good
history
yet
the
history
gets
the
benefit
of
an
expert
judgment
and
two
columns
of
thoughtful
pimse
or
censure
while
the
poem
play
or
novel
is
treated
to
ten
skittish
lines
by
the
hack
who
happens
to
be
within
nearest
call
when
the
book
comes
in
part
of
the
preface
to
the
first
edition
i
may
as
well
confess
what
it
would
be
affectation
to
conceal
that
i
am
more
than
pleased
with
the
generous
reception
accorded
to
this
story
as
a
serial
in
the
columns
of
and
it
has
been
in
my
mind
since
i
was
a
hoosier
boy
to
do
something
toward
describing
life
in
the
districts
of
the
western
states
it
used
to
be
a
matter
of
no
little
jealousy
with
us
i
remember
that
the
manners
customs
thoughts
and
feelings
of
new
england
country
people
filled
so
large
a
place
in
books
while
our
life
not
less
interesting
not
less
romantic
and
certainly
not
less
filled
with
humorous
and
grotesque
material
had
no
place
in
literature
it
was
as
though
we
were
shut
out
of
good
society
and
with
the
single
exception
of
alice
gary
perhaps
our
western
writers
did
not
dare
speak
of
the
west
otherwise
than
as
the
unreal
world
to
which
cooper
lively
imagination
had
given
birth
i
had
some
anxiety
lest
western
readers
should
take
offence
at
my
selecting
what
must
always
seem
an
exceptional
phase
of
life
to
those
who
have
grown
up
in
the
more
refined
regions
of
the
west
but
nowhere
has
the
been
received
more
kindly
than
in
his
own
country
and
among
his
own
people
some
of
those
who
have
spoken
generous
words
of
the
and
his
friends
have
suggested
that
the
story
is
an
autobiography
but
it
is
not
save
in
the
sense
in
which
every
work
of
art
is
an
autobiography
in
that
it
is
the
result
of
the
experience
and
observation
of
the
writer
readers
will
therefore
bear
in
mind
that
not
ralph
nor
bud
nor
brother
sodom
nor
small
represents
the
writer
nor
do
i
appear
as
talleyrand
said
of
madame
de
sta√´l
disguised
as
a
woman
in
the
person
of
hannah
or
mirandy
some
of
the
incidents
have
been
drawn
from
life
none
of
them
i
believe
from
my
own
i
should
like
to
be
considered
a
member
of
the
church
of
the
best
licks
however
it

a

from
a

want
to
be
a
do
you
you
well
what
would
do
in
flat
crick
deestrick
like
to
know
why
the
boys
have
driv
off
the
last
two
and
licked
the
one
afore
them
like
blazes
you
might
teach
a
summer
school
when
nothin
but
children
come
but
i
it
takes
a
right
smart
to
be
in
flat
crick
in
the
winter
they
pitch
you
out
of
doors
sonny
neck
and
heels
afore
christmas
the
young
man
who
had
walked
ten
miles
to
get
the
school
in
this
district
and
who
had
been
mentally
reviewing
his
learning
at
every
step
he
took
trembling
lest
the
committee
should
find
that
he
did
not
know
enough
was
not
a
little
taken
aback
at
this
greeting
from
old
jack
means
who
was
the
first
trustee
that
he
lighted
on
the
impression
made
by
these
ominous
remarks
was
emphasized
by
the
glances
which
he
received
from
jack
means
two
sons
the
older
one
eyed
him
from
the
top
of
his
brawny
shoulders
with
that
amiable
look
which
a
big
dog
turns
on
a
little
one
before
shaking
him
ralph
hartsook
had
never
thought
of
being
measured
by
the
standard
of
muscle
this
notion
of
beating
education
into
young
savages
in
spite
of
themselves
dashed
his
ardor
he
had
walked
right
to
where
jack
means
was
at
work
shaving
shingles
in
his
own
front
yard
while
means
was
making
the
speech
which
we
have
set
down
above
and
punctuating
it
with
expectorations
a
large
brindle
bulldog
had
been
sniffing
at
ralph
heels
and
a
girl
in
a
new
dress
standing
by
the
door
had
nearly
giggled
her
head
off
at
the
delightful
prospect
of
seeing
a
new
eaten
up
by
the
ferocious
brute
the
disheartening
words
of
the
old
man
the
immense
muscles
of
the
young
man
who
was
to
be
his
rebellious
pupil
the
jaws
of
the
ugly
bulldog
and
the
heartless
giggle
of
the
girl
gave
ralph
a
delightful
sense
of
having
precipitated
himself
into
a
den
of
wild
beasts
faint
with
weariness
and
discouragement
and
shivering
with
fear
he
sat
down
on
a
wheelbarrow
you
bull
said
the
old
man
to
the
dog
which
was
showing
more
and
more
a
disposition
to
make
a
meal
of
the
incipient
pedagogue
you
bull
git
aout
you
pup
the
dog
walked
sullenly
off
but
not
until
he
had
given
ralph
a
look
full
of
promise
of
what
he
meant
to
do
when
he
got
a
good
chance
ralph
wished
himself
back
in
the
village
of
lewisburg
whence
he
had
come
you
see
continued
means
spitting
in
a
meditative
sort
of
a
way
you
see
we
none
of
your
saft
sort
in
these
diggings
it
takes
a
to
boss
this
deestrick
howsumdever
ef
you
think
you
kin
trust
your
hide
in
flat
crick
i
got
no
but
ef
you
git
licked
do
come
on
us
flat
crick
do
pay
no
you
bet
any
other
trustees
wal
yes
but
as
i
pay
the
most
taxes
jist
let
me
run
the
thing
you
can
begin
right
off
a
monday
they
been
no
other
applications
you
see
it
takes
grit
to
apply
for
this
school
the
last
master
had
a
black
eye
for
a
month
but
as
i
wuz
sayin
you
can
jist
roll
up
and
wade
in
i
you
got
spunk
maybe
and
that
goes
for
a
heap
sight
sinnoo
with
boys
walk
in
and
stay
over
sunday
with
me
you
hev
to
board
roun
and
i
guess
you
better
begin
here
ralph
did
not
go
in
but
sat
out
on
the
wheelbarrow
watching
the
old
man
shave
shingles
while
the
boys
split
the
blocks
and
chopped
wood
bull
smelled
of
the
again
in
an
ugly
way
and
got
a
good
kick
from
the
older
son
for
his
pains
but
out
of
one
of
his
red
eyes
the
dog
warned
the
young
that
should
yet
suffer
for
all
kicks
received
on
his
account
ef
bull
once
takes
a
holt
heaven
and
yarth
ca
make
him
let
go
said
the
older
son
to
ralph
by
way
of
comfort
it
was
well
for
ralph
that
he
began
to
board
roun
by
stopping
at
means
ralph
felt
that
flat
creek
was
what
he
needed
he
had
lived
a
bookish
life
but
here
was
his
lesson
in
the
art
of
managing
people
for
he
who
can
manage
the
untamed
and
strapping
youths
of
a
winter
school
in
hoopole
county
has
gone
far
toward
learning
one
of
the
hardest
of
lessons
and
in
ralph
time
things
were
worse
than
they
are
now
the
older
son
of
means
was
called
bud
means
what
his
real
name
was
ralph
could
not
find
out
for
in
many
of
these
families
the
nickname
of
bud
given
to
the
oldest
boy
and
that
of
sis
which
is
the
of
the
oldest
girl
completely
bury
the
proper
christian
name
ralph
saw
his
first
strategic
point
which
was
to
capture
bud
means
after
supper
the
boys
began
to
get
ready
for
something
bull
stuck
up
his
ears
in
a
dignified
way
and
the
three
or
four
yellow
curs
who
were
bull
satellites
yelped
delightedly
and
discordantly
bill
said
bud
means
to
his
brother
ax
the
master
ef
he
like
to
hunt
coons
i
like
to
take
the
starch
out
uv
the
feller
said
was
bill
reply
you
dur
do
it
said
bud
i
do
take
no
sech
a
dare
returned
bill
and
walked
down
to
the
gate
by
which
ralph
stood
watching
the
stars
come
out
and
half
wishing
he
had
never
seen
flat
creek
i
say
mister
began
bill
mister
they
a
coon
what
been
a
our
chickens
lately
and
we
goin
to
try
to
ketch
the
varmint
you
would
like
to
take
a
coon
hunt
nor
nothin
would
you
why
yes
said
ralph
there
nothing
i
should
like
better
if
i
could
only
be
sure
bull
would
mistake
me
for
the
coon
and
so
as
a
matter
of
policy
ralph
dragged
his
tired
legs
eight
or
ten
miles
on
hill
and
in
hollow
after
bud
and
bill
and
bull
and
the
coon
but
the
raccoon
climbed
a
tree
the
boys
got
into
a
quarrel
about
whose
business
it
was
to
have
brought
the
axe
and
who
was
to
blame
that
the
tree
could
not
be
felled
now
if
there
was
anything
ralph
muscles
were
good
for
it
was
climbing
so
asking
bud
to
give
him
a
start
he
soon
reached
the
limb
above
the
one
on
which
the
raccoon
was
ralph
did
not
know
how
ugly
a
customer
a
raccoon
can
be
and
so
got
credit
for
more
courage
than
he
had
with
much
peril
to
his
legs
from
the
raccoon
teeth
he
succeeded
in
shaking
the
poor
creature
off
among
the
yelping
brutes
and
yelling
boys
ralph
could
not
help
sympathizing
with
the
hunted
animal
which
sold
its
life
as
dearly
as
possible
giving
the
dogs
many
a
scratch
and
bite
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
like
the
raccoon
precipitated
into
the
midst
of
a
party
of
dogs
who
would
rejoice
in
worrying
life
out
as
bull
and
his
crowd
were
destroying
the
poor
raccoon
when
bull
at
last
seized
the
raccoon
and
put
an
end
to
it
ralph
could
not
but
admire
the
decided
way
in
which
he
did
it
calling
to
mind
bud
comment
ef
bull
once
takes
a
holt
heaven
and
yarth
ca
make
him
let
go
but
as
they
walked
home
bud
carrying
the
raccoon
by
the
tail
ralph
felt
that
his
hunt
had
not
been
in
vain
he
fancied
that
even
bull
walking
uncomfortably
close
to
his
heels
respected
him
more
since
he
had
climbed
that
tree
purty
peart
kind
of
a
master
remarked
the
old
man
to
bud
after
ralph
had
gone
to
bed
guess
you
better
be
a
little
easy
on
him
hey
but
bud
deigned
no
reply
perhaps
because
he
knew
that
ralph
heard
the
conversation
through
the
thin
partition
ralph
woke
delighted
to
find
it
raining
he
did
not
want
to
hunt
or
fish
on
sunday
and
this
steady
rain
would
enable
him
to
make
friends
with
bud
i
do
not
know
how
he
got
started
but
after
breakfast
he
began
to
tell
stories
out
of
all
the
books
he
had
ever
read
he
told
story
after
story
and
old
man
means
and
old
means
and
bud
means
and
bill
means
and
sis
means
listened
with
great
eyes
while
he
told
of
sinbad
adventures
of
the
old
man
of
the
sea
of
robinson
crusoe
of
captain
gulliver
experiences
in
liliput
and
of
baron
exploits
ralph
had
caught
his
fish
the
hungry
minds
of
these
backwoods
people
were
refreshed
with
the
new
life
that
came
to
their
imaginations
in
these
stories
for
there
was
but
one
book
in
the
means
library
and
that
a
copy
of
captain
riley
narrative
had
long
since
lost
all
freshness
i
be
said
bill
emphatically
ef
i
had
hear
the
master
tell
them
whoppin
yarns
than
to
go
to
a
circus
the
best
day
i
ever
seed
bill
could
pay
no
higher
compliment
what
ralph
wanted
was
to
make
a
friend
of
bud
it
a
nice
thing
to
have
the
ship
on
your
own
side
and
the
more
hartsook
admired
the
knotted
muscles
of
bud
means
the
more
he
desired
to
attach
him
to
himself
so
whenever
he
struck
out
a
peculiarly
brilliant
passage
he
anxiously
watched
bud
eye
but
the
young
philistine
kept
his
own
counsel
he
listened
but
said
nothing
and
the
eyes
under
his
shaggy
brows
gave
no
sign
ralph
could
not
tell
whether
those
eyes
were
deep
and
inscrutable
or
only
stolid
perhaps
a
little
of
both
when
monday
morning
came
ralph
was
nervous
he
walked
to
school
with
bud
i
guess
you
a
little
skeered
by
what
the
old
man
said
you
ralph
was
about
to
deny
it
but
on
reflection
concluded
that
it
was
best
to
speak
the
truth
he
said
that
means
description
of
the
school
had
made
him
feel
a
little
what
will
you
do
with
the
tough
boys
you
no
match
for
and
ralph
felt
bud
eyes
not
only
measuring
his
muscles
but
scrutinizing
his
countenance
he
only
answered
i
do
know
what
would
you
do
with
me
for
instance
and
bud
stretched
himself
up
as
if
to
shake
out
the
reserve
power
coiled
up
in
his
great
muscles
i
have
any
trouble
with
you
why
i
the
wust
chap
of
all
i
thrashed
the
last
master
myself
and
again
the
eyes
of
bud
means
looked
out
sharply
from
his
shadowing
brows
to
see
the
effect
of
this
speech
on
the
slender
young
man
you
wo
thrash
me
though
said
ralph
pshaw
i
i
could
whip
you
in
an
inch
of
your
life
with
my
left
hand
and
never
half
try
said
young
means
with
a
threatening
sneer
i
know
that
as
well
as
you
do
well
you
afraid
of
me
then
and
again
he
looked
sidewise
at
ralph
not
a
bit
said
ralph
wondering
at
his
own
courage
they
walked
on
in
silence
a
minute
bud
was
turning
the
matter
over
why
you
afraid
of
me
he
said
presently
because
you
and
i
are
going
to
be
friends
and
what
about
i
am
not
afraid
of
all
the
other
boys
put
together
you
the
mischief
how
that
well
i
not
afraid
of
them
because
you
and
i
are
going
to
be
friends
and
you
can
whip
all
of
them
together
you
do
the
fighting
and
do
the
teaching
the
diplomatic
bud
only
chuckled
a
little
at
this
whether
he
assented
to
the
alliance
or
not
ralph
could
not
tell
when
ralph
looked
round
on
the
faces
of
the
scholars
the
little
faces
full
of
mischief
and
curiosity
the
big
faces
full
of
an
expression
which
was
not
further
removed
than
from
contempt
when
when
young
hartsook
looked
into
these
faces
his
heart
palpitated
with
there
is
no
audience
so
hard
to
face
as
one
of
as
many
a
man
has
found
to
his
cost
perhaps
it
is
that
no
conventional
restraint
can
keep
down
their
laughter
when
you
do
or
say
anything
ridiculous
hartsook
first
day
was
hurried
and
unsatisfactory
he
was
not
of
himself
and
consequently
not
master
of
anybody
else
when
evening
came
there
were
symptoms
of
insubordination
through
the
whole
school
poor
ralph
was
sick
at
heart
he
felt
that
if
there
had
ever
been
the
shadow
of
an
alliance
between
himself
and
bud
it
was
all
off
now
it
seemed
to
hartsook
that
even
bull
had
lost
his
respect
for
the
teacher
half
that
night
the
young
man
lay
awake
at
last
comfort
came
to
him
a
reminiscence
of
the
death
of
the
raccoon
flashed
on
him
like
a
vision
he
remembered
that
quiet
and
annihilating
bite
which
bull
gave
he
remembered
bud
certificate
that
ef
bull
once
takes
a
holt
heaven
and
yarth
ca
make
him
let
go
he
thought
that
what
flat
creek
needed
was
a
bulldog
he
would
be
a
bulldog
quiet
but
invincible
he
would
take
hold
in
such
a
way
that
nothing
should
make
him
let
go
and
then
he
went
to
sleep
in
the
morning
ralph
got
out
of
bed
slowly
he
put
his
clothes
on
slowly
he
pulled
on
his
boots
in
a
bulldog
mood
he
tried
to
move
as
he
thought
bull
would
move
if
he
were
a
man
he
ate
with
deliberation
and
looked
everybody
in
the
eyes
with
a
manner
that
made
bud
watch
him
curiously
he
found
himself
continually
comparing
himself
with
bull
he
found
bull
possessing
a
strange
fascination
for
him
he
walked
to
school
alone
the
rest
having
gone
on
before
he
entered
the
preserving
a
cool
and
dogged
manner
he
saw
in
the
eyes
of
the
boys
that
there
was
mischief
brewing
he
did
not
dare
sit
down
in
his
chair
for
fear
of
a
pin
everybody
looked
solemn
ralph
lifted
the
lid
of
his
desk
it
was
the
voice
of
an
imprisoned
puppy
and
the
school
giggled
and
then
roared
then
everything
was
quiet
the
scholars
expected
an
outburst
of
wrath
from
the
teacher
for
they
had
come
to
regard
the
whole
world
as
divided
into
two
classes
the
teacher
on
the
one
side
representing
lawful
authority
and
the
pupils
on
the
other
in
a
state
of
chronic
rebellion
to
play
a
trick
on
the
master
was
an
evidence
of
spirit
to
lick
the
master
was
to
be
the
crowned
hero
of
flat
creek
district
such
a
hero
was
bud
means
and
bill
who
had
less
muscle
saw
a
chance
to
distinguish
himself
on
a
teacher
of
slender
frame
hence
the
puppy
in
the
desk
ralph
hartsook
grew
red
in
the
face
when
he
saw
the
puppy
but
the
cool
repressed
bulldog
mood
in
which
he
had
kept
himself
saved
him
he
lifted
the
dog
into
his
arms
and
stroked
him
until
the
laughter
subsided
then
in
a
solemn
and
set
way
he
began
i
am
sorry
and
he
looked
round
the
room
with
a
steady
hard
eye
everybody
felt
that
there
was
a
conflict
coming
i
am
sorry
that
any
scholar
in
this
school
could
be
so
mean
the
word
was
uttered
with
a
sharp
emphasis
and
all
the
big
boys
felt
sure
that
there
would
be
a
fight
with
bill
means
and
perhaps
with
bud
could
be
so
as
to
shut
up
his
in
such
a
place
as
that
there
was
a
long
derisive
laugh
the
wit
was
indifferent
but
by
one
stroke
ralph
had
carried
the
whole
school
to
his
side
by
the
significant
glances
of
the
boys
hartsook
detected
the
perpetrator
of
the
joke
and
with
the
hard
and
dogged
look
in
his
eyes
with
just
such
a
look
as
bull
would
give
a
puppy
but
with
the
utmost
suavity
in
his
voice
he
said
william

will
you
be
so
good
as
to
put
this
dog
out
of
doors

this

is
not

jamieson
gives
dugon
as
a
noun
it
is
given
in
the
supplement
to
jamieson
however
as
dogon
but
still
as
a
noun
with
an
ancient
plural
it
is
explained
as
a

the

a
word

it
is
of
course
a
question
whether
the
noun
and
its
french
antecedents
are
connected
with
the
american
verb
it
is
easy
to
conceive
that
such
an
epithet
as
might
get
itself
mixed
up
with
the
word
dog
and
so
become
an
imprecation
for
instance
a
servant

a

to
resign

place

before

here
the
word
might
have
been
the
old
epithet

an
abbreviated
participle

apparently
a
corruption
of
in
the
phrase
i
be
dogged
i
prefer
to
because
in
the

the
sense
of
setting

from
the
primitive
sense
of
the

to
give

was

this
time
until

and

sis

or
as
she
wished
now
to
be
called

expressed
herself
most
positively
in
favor
of
it
she
said
that
she
the
folks
in
that
district
could
in
no
wise
do
without
it
but
it
was
rather
to
its
social
than
to
its
intellectual
benefits
that
she
referred
for
all
the
ever
seen
could
not
enable
her
to
stand
anywhere
but
at
the
foot
of
the
class
there
is
one
branch
diligently
taught
in
a
backwoods
school
the
public
mind
seems
impressed
with
the
difficulties
of
english
orthography
and
there
is
a
solemn
conviction
that
the
chief
end
of
man
is
to
learn
to
spell
webster
elementary
came
down
from
heaven
would
be
the
backwoods
version
of
the
saying
but
that
unfortunately
for
the
greeks
their
fame
has
not
reached
so
far
it
often
happens
that
the
pupil
does
not
know
the
meaning
of
a
single
word
in
the
lesson
this
is
of
no
consequence
what
do
you
want
to
know
the
meaning
of
a
word
for
words
were
made
to
be
spelled
and
men
were
probably
created
that
they
might
spell
them
hence
the
necessity
for
sending
a
pupil
through
the
five
times
before
you
allow
him
to
begin
to
read
or
indeed
to
do
anything
else
hence
the
necessity
for
those
long
at
the
close
of
each
forenoon
and
afternoon
session
of
the
school
to
stand
at
the
head
of
which
is
the
cherished
ambition
of
every
scholar
hence
too
the
necessity
for
devoting
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
session
of
each
friday
to
a
in
fact
spelling
is
the
national
game
in
hoopole
county
baseball
and
croquet
matches
are
as
unknown
as
olympian
spelling
and
shucking
are
the
only
public
competitions
so
the
fatal
had
to
be
appointed
for
the
wednesday
of
the
second
week
of
the
session
just
when
ralph
felt
himself
master
of
the
situation
not
that
he
was
without
his
annoyances
one
of
troubles
in
the
week
before
the
was
that
he
was
loved
the
other
that
he
was
hated
and
while
the
time
between
the
appointing
of
the
spelling
tournament
and
the
actual
occurrence
of
that
remarkable
event
is
engaged
in
elapsing
let
me
narrate
two
incidents
that
made
it
for
ralph
a
trying
time
footnotes
footnote
in
naming
the
several
parts
of
the
indian
corn
and
the
dishes
made
from
it
the
english
language
was
put
to
many
shifts
such
words
as
and
were
poetically
applied
to
the
blossoms
and
were
borrowed
from
other
sorts
of
corn
and
the
indian
tongues
were
forced
to
pay
tribute
to
name
the
dishes
borrowed
from
the
savages
from
them
we
have
and
for
other
nouns
words
were
borrowed
from
english
provincial
dialects
is
one
of
these
on
the
northern
belt
shucks
are
the
outer
covering
of
nuts
in
the
middle
and
southern
regions
the
word
is
applied
to
what
in
new
england
is
called
the
husks
of
the
corn
however
is
much
more
widely
used
than
in
colloquial
speech
the
farmers
in
more
than
half
of
the
united
states
are
hardly
acquainted
with
the
word
as
applied
to
the
envelope
of
the
ear
in
the
middle
states
and
in
some
parts
of
the
south
and
west
means
the
bran
of
the
cornmeal
as
notably
in
davy
verse
she
sifted
the
meal
she
gim

she
baked

she
gim
me
the

she
the

she

she
gim

a

and
sent
me
home
in
parts
of

before
the
war
the
word
or
meant
the
cob
or
spike
of
the

smack

a
threat
i
have
often
heard
one
negro
boy
make
to
another
is
provincial
english
for
ear
and
i
have
known
a
cob
of
corn
used
in
canada
for
an
ear
of
indian
corn
while
writing
this
note
a
cob
of
indian
corn
meaning
an
ear
appears
in
the
report
of
an
address
by
a
distinguished
man
at
a
recent
meeting
of
the
royal
geographical
society
a
lady
tells
me
that
she
met
in
the
book
of
an
english
traveller
the
remarkable
statement
that
the
americans
are
very
fond
of
the
young
grain
called
cob
these
words
have
reached
an
accepted
meaning
after
a
competition
to
corn
among
the
earliest
settlers
of
virginia
meant
to
take
it
out
of
the
envelope
which
was
presumably
called
the
shell
the
analogy
is
with
the
shelling
of

mirandy
hank
and
shocky
mirandy
had
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
new
master
until
he
developed
the
bulldog
in
his
character
mirandy
fell
in
love
with
the
bulldog
like
many
other
girls
of
her
class
she
was
greatly
enamored
with
the
subjection
of
women
and
she
stood
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
any
man
strong
enough
to
be
her
master
much
has
been
said
of
the
woman
i
offer
this
psychological
remark
as
a
contribution
to
the
natural
history
of
the
woman
it
was
at
the
close
of
that
very
second
day
on
which
ralph
had
achieved
his
first
victory
over
the
school
and
in
which
mirandy
had
been
seized
with
her
desperate
passion
for
him
that
she
told
him
about
it
not
in
words
we
do
not
allow
in
the
most
civilized
countries
and
still
less
would
it
be
tolerated
in
hoopole
county
but
mirandy
told
the
master
the
fact
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
though
no
word
passed
her
lips
she
walked
by
him
from
school
she
cast
at
him
what
are
commonly
called
ralph
thought
them
more
like
calf
eyes
she
changed
the
whole
tone
of
her
voice
she
whined
ordinarily
now
she
whimpered
and
so
by
ogling
him
by
blushing
at
him
by
tittering
at
him
by
giggling
at
him
by
snickering
at
him
by
simpering
at
him
by
making
herself
tenfold
more
a
fool
even
than
nature
had
made
her
she
managed
to
convey
to
the
dismayed
soul
of
the
young
teacher
the
frightful
intelligence
that
he
was
loved
by
the
richest
the
ugliest
the
silliest
the
coarsest
and
the
most
entirely
contemptible
girl
in
flat
creek
district
ralph
sat
by
the
fire
the
next
morning
trying
to
read
a
few
minutes
before
while
the
boys
were
doing
the
chores
and
the
bound
girl
was
milking
the
cows
with
no
one
in
the
room
but
the
old
woman
she
was
generally
as
silent
as
bud
but
now
she
seemed
for
some
unaccountable
reason
disposed
to
talk
she
had
sat
down
on
the
broad
hearth
to
have
her
usual
morning
smoke
the
poplar
table
adorned
by
no
cloth
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
unwashed
blue
teacups
sat
in
the
unwashed
blue
saucers
the
unwashed
blue
plates
kept
company
with
the
begrimed
blue
pitcher
the
dirty
skillets
by
the
fire
were
kept
in
countenance
by
the
dirtier
pots
and
the
ashes
were
drifted
and
strewn
over
the
in
a
most
picturesque
way
you
see
said
the
old
woman
knocking
the
residuum
from
her
cob
pipe
and
chafing
some
dry
leaf
between
her
withered
hands
preparatory
to
filling
it
again
you
see
hartsook
my
ole
man
purty
well
along
in
the
world
he
got
a
right
smart
lot
of
this
world
plunder
one
way
and
another
and
while
she
stuffed
the
tobacco
into
her
pipe
ralph
wondered
why
she
should
mention
it
to
him
you
see
we
moved
in
here
nigh
upon
years
ago
was
when
my
jack
him
as
died
afore
bud
was
born
was
a
baby
bud
be
the
fif
of
next
june
here
means
stopped
to
rake
a
live
coal
out
of
the
fire
with
her
skinny
finger
and
then
to
carry
it
in
her
skinny
palm
to
the
bowl
or
to
the
of
her
cob
pipe
when
she
got
the
smoke
she
proceeded
you
see
this
yere
bottom
land
was
all
congress
land
in
them
there
days
and
it
sold
for
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
and
i
says
to
my
ole
man
says
i
do
you
git
a
plenty
while
you
git
a
plenty
while
you
says
i
never
be
no
is
now
and
it
been
i
knowed
and
means
took
the
pipe
from
her
mouth
to
indulge
in
a
good
chuckle
at
the
thought
of
her
financial
shrewdness
a
plenty
while
says
i
could
see
you
know
they
was
a
powerful
sight
of
money
in
congress
land
that
what
made
me
say
a
plenty
while
you
and
jack
he
wuth
lots
and
gobs
of
money
all
made
out
of
congress
land
jack
did
git
rich
by
hard
work
bless
you
no
not
him
that
his
way
hard
work
you
know
was
that
air
six
hundred
dollars
he
got
along
of
me
all
salted
down
into
flat
crick
bottoms
at
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
a
acre
and
was
my
sayin
a
plenty
while
you
a
gittin
as
done
it
and
here
the
old
ogre
laughed
or
grinned
horribly
at
ralph
showing
her
few
straggling
discolored
teeth
then
she
got
up
and
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
her
pipe
and
laid
the
pipe
away
and
walked
round
in
front
of
ralph
after
adjusting
the
chunks
so
that
the
fire
would
burn
she
turned
her
yellow
face
toward
ralph
and
scanning
him
closely
came
out
with
the
climax
of
her
speech
in
the
remark
you
see
as
how
hartsook
the
man
what
gits
my
do
well
flat
crick
land
wuth
nigt
upon
a
hundred
a
acre
this
gentle
hint
came
near
knocking
ralph
down
had
flat
creek
land
been
worth
a
hundred
times
a
hundred
dollars
an
acre
and
had
he
owned
five
hundred
times
means
five
hundred
acres
he
would
have
given
it
all
just
at
that
moment
to
have
annihilated
the
whole
tribe
of
meanses
except
bud
bud
was
a
giant
but
a
one
he
thought
he
would
except
bud
from
the
general
destruction
as
for
the
rest
he
mentally
pictured
to
himself
the
pleasure
of
attending
their
funerals
there
was
one
thought
however
between
him
and
despair
he
felt
confident
that
the
cordiality
the
intensity
and
the
persistency
of
his
dislike
of
sis
means
were
such
that
he
should
never
inherit
a
foot
of
the
flat
creek
bottoms
but
what
about
bud
what
if
he
joined
the
conspiracy
to
marry
him
to
this
or
backwoods
nymph
if
ralph
felt
it
a
misfortune
to
be
loved
by
mirandy
means
he
found
himself
almost
equally
unfortunate
in
having
incurred
the
hatred
of
the
meanest
boy
in
school
hank
banta
smirky
and
crafty
was
the
first
sufferer
by
ralph
determination
to
use
corporal
punishment
and
so
henry
banta
who
was
a
compound
of
deceit
and
resentment
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
annoy
the
young
who
was
obliged
to
live
perpetually
on
his
guard
against
his
tricks
one
morning
as
ralph
walked
toward
the
he
met
little
shocky
what
the
boy
first
name
or
last
name
was
the
teacher
did
not
know
he
had
given
his
name
as
shocky
and
all
the
teacher
knew
was
that
he
was
commonly
called
shocky
that
he
was
an
orphan
that
he
lived
with
a
family
named
pearson
over
in
rocky
hollow
and
that
he
was
the
most
faithful
and
affectionate
child
in
the
school
on
this
morning
that
i
speak
of
ralph
had
walked
toward
the
school
early
to
avoid
the
company
of
mirandy
but
not
caring
to
sustain
his
dignity
longer
than
was
necessary
he
loitered
along
the
road
admiring
the
trunks
of
the
maples
and
picking
up
a
now
and
then
just
as
he
was
about
to
go
on
toward
the
school
he
caught
sight
of
little
shocky
running
swiftly
toward
him
but
looking
from
side
to
side
as
if
afraid
of
being
seen
illustration
betsy
short
well
shocky
what
is
it
and
ralph
put
his
hand
kindly
on
the
great
bushy
head
of
white
hair
from
which
came
shocky
nickname
shocky
had
to
pant
a
minute
why
hartsook
he
gasped
scratching
his
head
they
a
pond
down
under
the
and
here
shocky
breath
gave
out
entirely
for
a
minute
yes
shocky
i
know
that
what
about
it
the
trustees
have
come
to
fill
it
up
have
they
oh
no
sir
but
hank
banta
you
know
and
shocky
took
another
breathing
spell
standing
as
dose
to
ralph
as
he
could
for
poor
shocky
got
all
his
sunshine
from
the
master
presence
has
henry
fallen
in
and
got
a
ducking
shocky
oh
no
sir
he
wants
to
git
you
in
you
see
well
i
wo
go
in
though
shocky
but
you
see
he
been
and
gone
and
pulled
back
the
board
that
you
have
to
step
on
to
git
ahind
your
desk
he
been
and
gone
and
pulled
back
the
board
so
as
you
ca
help
it
up
and
right
in
ef
you
step
there
and
so
you
came
to
tell
me
there
was
a
huskiness
in
ralph
voice
he
had
then
one
friend
in
flat
creek
district
poor
little
shocky
he
put
his
arm
around
shocky
just
a
moment
and
then
told
him
to
hasten
across
to
the
other
road
so
as
to
come
back
to
the
in
a
direction
at
right
angles
to
the
master
approach
but
the
caution
was
not
needed
shocky
had
taken
care
to
leave
in
that
way
and
was
altogether
too
cunning
to
be
seen
coming
down
the
road
with
hartsook
but
after
he
got
over
the
fence
to
go
through
the
sugar
camp
or
sugar
as
they
say
at
the
east
he
stopped
and
turned
back
once
or
twice
just
to
catch
one
more
smile
from
ralph
and
then
he
hied
away
through
the
tall
trees
a
very
happy
boy
kicking
and
ploughing
the
brown
leaves
before
him
in
his
perfect
delight
saying
over
and
over
again
how
he
looked
at
me
how
he
did
look
and
when
ralph
came
up
to
the
door
there
was
shocky
sauntering
along
from
the
other
direction
throwing
bits
of
limestone
at
fence
rails
and
smiling
still
clear
down
to
his
shoes
at
thought
of
the
master
kind
words
what
a
quare
boy
shocky
is
remarked
betsey
short
with
a
giggle
he
just
likes
to
wander
round
alone
i
see
him
out
of
the
sugar
camp
just
now
he
been
in
there
half
an
hour
and
betsey
giggled
again
for
betsey
short
could
giggle
on
slighter
provocation
than
any
other
girl
on
flat
creek
when
ralph
hartsook
with
the
quiet
dogged
tread
that
he
was
cultivating
walked
into
the
he
took
great
care
not
to
seem
to
see
the
trap
set
for
him
but
he
carelessly
stepped
over
the
board
that
had
been
so
nicely
adjusted
the
boys
who
were
hank
confidants
in
the
plot
were
very
busy
over
their
slates
and
took
pains
not
to
show
their
disappointment
the
morning
session
wore
on
without
incident
ralph
several
times
caught
two
people
looking
at
him
one
was
mirandy
her
weak
and
watery
eyes
stole
loving
glances
over
the
top
of
her
which
she
would
not
study
her
looks
made
ralph
spirits
sink
to
forty
below
zero
and
congeal
but
on
one
of
the
backless
little
benches
that
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
was
little
shocky
who
also
cast
many
love
glances
at
the
young
master
glances
as
grateful
to
his
heart
as
mirandy
ogling
he
was
tempted
to
call
it
ogring
was
hateful
look
at
shocky
giggled
betsey
short
behind
her
slate
he
looks
as
if
he
was
to
eat
the
master
up
body
and
soul
and
so
the
forenoon
wore
on
as
usual
and
those
who
laid
the
trap
had
forgotten
it
themselves
the
morning
session
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
fire
in
the
great
old
had
burnt
low
the
flames
which
seemed
to
shocky
to
be
angels
had
disappeared
and
now
the
bright
coals
which
had
played
the
part
of
men
and
women
and
houses
in
fancy
had
taken
on
a
white
and
downy
covering
of
ashes
and
the
great
lay
there
smouldering
like
a
giant
asleep
in
a
shocky
longed
to
wake
him
up
as
for
henry
banta
he
was
too
much
bothered
to
get
the
answer
to
a
sum
he
was
doing
to
remember
anything
about
his
trap
in
fact
he
had
quite
forgotten
that
half
an
hour
ago
in
the
employment
of
drawing
ugly
pictures
on
his
slate
and
coaxing
betsey
short
to
giggle
by
showing
them
slyly
across
the
once
or
twice
ralph
had
been
attracted
to
betsey
extraordinary
fits
of
giggling
and
had
come
so
near
to
catching
hank
that
the
boy
thought
it
best
not
to
run
any
further
risk
of
the
beech
switches
four
or
five
feet
long
laid
up
behind
the
master
in
sight
of
the
school
as
a
prophylactic
hence
his
application
just
now
to
his
sum
in
long
division
and
hence
his
puzzled
look
for
idler
that
he
was
his
sums
did
not
solve
themselves
easily
as
usual
in
such
cases
he
came
up
in
front
of
the
master
desk
to
have
the
difficulty
explained
he
had
to
wait
a
minute
until
ralph
got
through
with
showing
betsey
short
who
had
been
seized
with
a
studying
fit
and
who
could
hardly
give
any
attention
to
the
teacher
explanations
she
did
want
to
giggle
so
much
not
at
anything
in
particular
but
just
at
things
in
general
while
ralph
was
doing
betsey
sum
for
her
he
was
solving
a
much
more
difficult
question
a
plan
had
flashed
upon
him
but
the
punishment
seemed
a
severe
one
he
gave
it
up
once
or
twice
but
he
remembered
how
turbulent
the
flat
creek
elements
were
and
had
he
not
inly
resolved
to
be
as
unrelenting
as
a
bulldog
he
fortified
himself
by
recalling
again
the
remark
of
bud
ef
bull
wunst
takes
a
holt
heaven
and
yarth
ca
make
him
let
go
and
so
he
resolved
to
give
hank
and
the
whole
school
one
good
lesson
just
step
round
behind
me
henry
and
you
can
see
how
i
do
this
said
ralph
hank
was
entirely
off
his
guard
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
slate
on
the
teacher
desk
he
sidled
round
upon
the
broad
loose
board
misplaced
by
his
own
hand
and
in
an
instant
the
other
end
of
the
board
rose
up
in
the
middle
of
the
almost
striking
shocky
in
the
face
while
henry
banta
went
down
into
the
water
beneath
the
why
henry
cried
ralph
jumping
to
his
feet
with
surprise
how
this
happen
him
by
the
fire
betsey
short
giggled
shocky
was
so
tickled
that
he
could
hardly
keep
his
seat
the
boys
who
were
in
the
plot
looked
very
serious
indeed
ralph
made
some
remarks
by
way
of
improving
the
occasion
he
spoke
strongly
of
the
utter
meanness
of
the
one
who
could
play
so
heartless
a
trick
on
a
schoolmate
he
said
that
it
was
as
much
thieving
to
get
your
fun
at
the
expense
of
another
as
to
steal
his
money
and
while
he
talked
all
eyes
were
turned
on
hank
all
except
the
eyes
of
mirandy
means
they
looked
simperingly
at
ralph
all
the
rest
looked
at
hank
the
fire
had
made
his
face
very
red
shocky
noticed
that
betsey
short
noticed
it
and
giggled
the
master
wound
up
with
an
appropriate
quotation
from
scripture
he
said
that
the
person
who
displaced
that
board
had
better
not
be
encouraged
by
the
success
he
said
with
a
curious
emphasis
of
the
present
experiment
to
attempt
another
trick
of
the
kind
for
it
was
set
down
in
the
bible
that
if
a
man
dug
a
pit
for
the
feet
of
another
he
would
be
very
likely
to
fall
in
it
himself
which
made
all
the
pupils
look
solemn
except
betsey
short
who
giggled
and
shocky
wanted
to
and
mirandy
cast
an
expiring
look
at
ralph
and
if
the
teacher
was
not
he
certainly
was
sick
of
mirandy
love

hank
banta
improved
plunge
bath
when
school
was
let
out
ralph
gave
hank
every
caution
that
he
could
about
taking
cold
and
even
lent
him
his
overcoat
very
much
against
hank
will
for
hank
had
obstinately
refused
to
go
home
before
the
school
was
dismissed
then
the
master
walked
out
in
a
quiet
and
subdued
way
to
spend
the
noon
recess
in
the
woods
while
shocky
watched
his
retreating
footsteps
with
loving
admiration
and
the
pupils
not
in
the
secret
canvassed
the
question
of
who
moved

board

said
he
bet
hank
did
it
which
set
betsey
short
off
in
an
uncontrollable
giggle
and
shocky
listened
innocently
but
that
night
bud
said
slyly
thunder
and
lightning
what
a
manager
you
mr
hartsook
to
which
ralph
returned
no
reply
except
a
friendly
smile
muscle
paid
tribute
to
brains
that
time
but
ralph
had
no
time
for
exultation
for
just
here
came
the
footnotes
footnote
this
word
is
probably
from
pennsylvania
as
it
is
exactly
equivalent
to
the
german
word
in
the
sense
of
household
effects
the
original
meaning
of
the
word
in
german
any
kind
of
baggage
may
be
called
but
the
most
accepted
sense
is
household

it

quite
seriously

the
old
designation
for
land
owned
by
the
government
under
the
confederation
the

was
the
government
and
the
forms
of
speech
seem
to
have
long
retained
the
notion
that
what
belonged
to
the
united
states
was
the
property
of

footnote
the
commonest
use
of

up
to
him
and
he
uses
sech
remarkable
smart
words
he
speaks
so
polite
too
but
laws
do
i
remember
when
he
was
poarer
nor
job
turkey
twenty
year
ago
when
he
come
to
these
diggings
that
air
squire
hawkins
was
a
poar
yankee
that
said
instid
of
bucket
and
that
called
a
cow
a
and
that
could
tell
to
save
his
gizzard
what
we
meant
by
and
by
but
he
larnt
our
ways
now
an
he
jest
as
civilized
as
the
rest
of
us
you
know
he
ever
been
a
yankee
he
did
stay
poar
long
not
he
he
jest
married
a
right
rich
girl
he
he
and
the
old
woman
grinned
at
ralph
and
then
at
mirandy
and
then
at
the
rest
until
ralph
shuddered
nothing
was
so
frightful
to
him
as
to
be
fawned
on
by
this
grinning
ogre
whose
few
lonesome
blackish
teeth
seemed
ready
to
devour
him
he
did
stay
poar
you
bet
a
hoss
and
with
this
the
coal
was
deposited
on
the
pipe
and
the
lips
began
to
crack
like
parchment
as
each
puff
of
smoke
escaped
he
married
rich
you
see
and
here
another
significant
look
at
the
young
master
and
another
fond
look
at
mirandy
as
she
puffed
away
reflectively
his
wife
had
no
been
through
the
wunst
and
had
got
as
fur
as
on
it
a
second
time
but
she
could
read
a
word
when
she
was
married
and
never
could
she
war
overly
smart
she
had
hardly
got
the
sense
the
law
allows
but
schools
was
skase
in
them
air
days
and
besides
do
do
no
good
to
a
woman
makes
her
stuck
up
i
never
knowed
but
one
gal
in
my
life
as
had
ciphered
into
fractions
and
she
was
so
stuck
up
that
she
turned
up
her
nose
one
night
at
a
bekase
i
tuck
a
sheet
off
the
bed
to
splice
out
the
which
was
rather
short
and
the
sheet
was
mos
clean
too
been
slep
on
wunst
or
twicet
but
i
was
goin
fer
to
say
that
when
squire
hawkins
married
virginny
gray
he
got
a
heap
o
money
or
what
the
same
thing
mostly
a
heap
o
good
land
and
says
ef
a
gal
had
gone
clean
through
all
eddication
and
got
to
the
rule
of
three
itself
that
buy
a
squire
hawkins
jest
put
eddication
agin
the
gal
farm
and
traded
even
an
ef
ary
one
of
got
swindled
i
never
heerd
no
complaints
and
here
she
looked
at
ralph
in
triumph
her
hard
face
splintering
into
the
hideous
semblance
of
a
smile
and
mirandy
cast
a
blushing
gushing
and
look
on
the
young
master
i
say
ole
woman
broke
in
old
jack
i
say
wot
is
all
this
spoutin
about
the
square
fer
and
old
jack
having
bit
off
an
ounce
of
pigtail
returned
the
plug
to
his
pocket
as
for
ralph
he
fell
into
a
sort
of
terror
he
had
a
guilty
feeling
that
this
speech
of
the
old
lady
had
somehow
committed
him
beyond
recall
to
mirandy
he
did
not
see
visions
of
suits
but
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
an
avenging
big
brother
hanner
you
kin
come
along
too
ef
you
a
mind
when
you
git
the
dishes
washed
said
means
to
the
bound
girl
as
she
shut
and
latched
the
back
door
the
means
family
had
built
a
new
house
in
front
of
the
old
one
as
a
sort
of
advertisement
of
bettered
circumstances
an
eruption
of
shoddy
feeling
but
when
the
new
building
was
completed
they
found
themselves
unable
to
occupy
it
for
anything
else
than
a
lumber
room
and
so
except
a
parlor
which
mirandy
had
made
an
effort
to
furnish
a
little
in
hope
of
the
blissful
time
when
somebody
should
set
up
with
her
of
evenings
the
new
building
was
almost
unoccupied
and
the
family
went
in
and
out
through
the
back
door
which
indeed
was
the
front
door
also
for
according
to
a
curious
custom
the
front
of
the
house
was
placed
toward
the
south
though
the
big
road
hoosier
for
ran
along
the
side
or
rather
past
the
corner
of
it
when
the
old
woman
had
spoken
thus
to
hannah
and
had
latched
the
door
she
muttered
that
gal
do
never
show
no
gratitude
fer
favors
to
which
bud
rejoined
that
he
did
think
she
had
no
great
sight
to
be
pertickler
thankful
fer
to
which
means
made
no
reply
thinking
it
best
perhaps
not
to
wake
up
her
dutiful
son
on
so
interesting
a
theme
as
her
treatment
of
hannah
ralph
felt
glad
that
he
was
this
evening
to
go
to
another
boarding
place
he
should
not
hear
the
rest
of
the
controversy
ralph
walked
to
the
with
bill
they
were
friends
again
for
when
hank
banta
ducking
and
his
dogged
obstinacy
in
sitting
in
his
wet
clothes
had
brought
on
a
serious
fever
ralph
had
called
together
the
big
boys
and
had
said
we
must
take
care
of
one
another
boys
who
will
volunteer
to
take
turns
sitting
up
with
henry
he
put
his
own
name
down
and
all
the
rest
followed
william
means
and
myself
will
sit
up
said
ralph
and
poor
bill
had
been
from
that
moment
the
teacher
friend
he
was
chosen
to
be
ralph
companion
he
was
puppy
means
no
longer
hank
could
not
be
conquered
by
kindness
and
the
teacher
was
made
to
feel
the
bitterness
of
his
resentment
long
after
but
bill
means
was
for
the
time
entirely
placated
and
he
and
ralph
went
to
together
every
family
furnished
a
candle
there
were
yellow
dips
and
white
dips
burning
smoking
and
flaring
there
was
laughing
and
talking
and
giggling
and
simpering
and
ogling
and
flirting
and
courting
what
a
party
is
to
fifth
avenue
a
is
to
hoopole
county
it
is
an
occasion
which
is
metaphorically
inscribed
with
this
legend
choose
your
partners
spelling
is
only
a
blind
in
hoopole
county
as
is
dancing
on
fifth
avenue
but
as
there
are
some
in
society
who
love
dancing
for
its
own
sake
so
in
flat
creek
district
there
were
those
who
loved
spelling
for
its
own
sake
and
who
smelling
the
battle
from
afar
had
come
to
try
their
skill
in
this
tournament
hoping
to
freshen
the
laurels
they
had
won
in
their
i
said
means
speaking
as
the
principal
school
trustee
i
our
friend
the
square
is
jest
the
man
to
boss
this
consarn
ef
nobody
objects
i
him
come
square
do
be
bashful
walk
up
to
the
trough
fodder
or
no
fodder
as
the
man
said
to
his
donkey
there
was
a
general
giggle
at
this
and
many
of
the
young
swains
took
occasion
to
nudge
the
girls
alongside
them
ostensibly
for
the
purpose
of
making
them
see
the
joke
but
really
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
nudging
the
greeks
figured
cupid
as
naked
probably
because
he
wears
so
many
disguises
that
they
could
not
select
a
costume
for
him
the
squire
came
to
the
front
ralph
made
an
inventory
of
the
agglomeration
which
bore
the
name
of
squire
hawkins
as
follows
a
coat
of
indefinite
age
worn
only
on
state
when
its
owner
was
called
to
figure
in
his
public
capacity
either
the
squire
had
grown
too
large
or
the
coat
too
small
a
pair
of
black
gloves
the
most
phenomenal
abnormal
and
unexpected
apparition
conceivable
in
flat
creek
district
where
the
preachers
wore
no
coats
in
the
summer
and
where
a
black
glove
was
never
seen
except
on
the
hands
of
the
squire
a
wig
of
that
dirty
waxen
color
so
common
to
wigs
this
one
showed
a
continual
inclination
to
slip
off
the
owner
smooth
bald
pate
and
the
squire
had
frequently
to
adjust
it
as
his
hair
had
been
red
the
wig
did
not
accord
with
his
face
and
the
hair
ungrayed
was
doubly
discordant
with
a
countenance
shrivelled
by
age
a
semicircular
row
of
whiskers
hedging
the
edge
of
the
jaw
and
chin
these
were
dyed
a
frightful
such
a
color
as
belonged
to
no
natural
hair
or
beard
that
ever
existed
at
the
roots
there
was
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
white
giving
the
whiskers
the
appearance
of
having
been
stuck
on
a
pair
of
spectacles
with
rim
wont
to
slip
off
a
glass
eye
purchased
of
a
peddler
and
differing
in
color
from
its
natural
mate
perpetually
getting
out
of
focus
by
turning
in
or
out
a
set
of
false
teeth
badly
fitted
and
given
to
bobbing
up
and
down
the
squire
proper
to
whom
these
patches
were
loosely
attached
it
is
an
old
story
that
a
boy
wrote
home
to
his
father
begging
him
to
come
west
because
mighty
mean
men
get
into
office
out
here
but
ralph
concluded
that
some
yankees
had
taught
school
in
hoopole
county
who
would
not
have
held
a
high
place
in
the
educational
institutions
of
massachusetts
hawkins
had
some
new
england
idioms
but
they
were
well
overlaid
by
a
western
pronunciation
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
began
shoving
up
his
spectacles
and
sucking
his
lips
over
his
white
teeth
to
keep
them
in
place
ladies
and
gentlemen
young
men
and
maidens
raley
i
obleeged
to
means
fer
this
honor
and
the
squire
took
both
hands
and
turned
the
top
of
his
head
round
half
an
inch
then
he
adjusted
his
spectacles
whether
he
was
obliged
to
means
for
the
honor
of
being
compared
to
a
donkey
was
not
clear
i
feel
in
the
inmost
compartments
of
my
animal
spirits
a
most
happifying
sense
of
the
success
and
futility
of
all
my
endeavors
to
sarve
the
people
of
flat
creek
deestrick
and
the
people
of
tomkins
township
in
my
weak
way
and
manner
this
burst
of
eloquence
was
delivered
with
a
constrained
air
and
an
apparent
sense
of
a
danger
that
he
squire
hawkins
might
fall
to
pieces
in
his
weak
way
and
manner
and
of
the
success
and
futility
of
all
attempts
at
reconstruction
for
by
this
time
the
ghastly
pupil
of
the
left
eye
which
was
black
was
looking
away
round
to
the
left
while
the
little
blue
one
on
the
right
twinkled
cheerfully
toward
the
front
the
front
teeth
would
drop
down
so
that
the
squire
mouth
was
kept
nearly
closed
and
his
words
whistled
through
i
feel
as
if
i
could
be
grandiloquent
on
this
interesting
occasion
twisting
his
scalp
round
but
raley
i
must
forego
any
such
exertions
it
is
spelling
you
want
spelling
is
the
the
grand
underlying
subterfuge
of
a
good
eddication
i
put
the
prepared
by
the
great
daniel
webster
alongside
the
bible
i
do
raley
i
think
i
may
put
it
ahead
of
the
bible
for
if
it
wur
fer
and
sich
occasions
as
these
where
would
the
bible
be
i
should
like
to
know
the
man
who
got
up
who
compounded
this
work
of
inextricable
valoo
was
a
benufactor
to
the
whole
human
race
or
any
other
here
the
spectacles
fell
off
the
squire
replaced
them
in
some
confusion
gave
the
top
of
his
head
another
twist
and
felt
of
his
glass
eye
while
poor
shocky
stared
in
wonder
and
betsey
short
rolled
from
side
to
side
in
the
effort
to
suppress
her
giggle
means
and
the
other
old
ladies
looked
the
applause
they
could
not
speak
i
larkin
lanham
and
jeems
buchanan
fer
captings
said
the
squire
and
the
two
young
men
thus
named
took
a
stick
and
tossed
it
from
hand
to
hand
to
decide
which
should
have
the
first
choice
one
tossed
the
stick
to
the
other
who
held
it
fast
just
where
he
happened
to
catch
it
then
the
first
placed
his
hand
above
the
second
and
so
the
hands
were
alternately
changed
to
the
top
the
one
who
held
the
stick
last
without
room
for
the
other
to
take
hold
had
gained
the
lot
this
was
tried
three
times
as
larkin
held
the
stick
twice
out
of
three
times
he
had
the
choice
he
hesitated
a
moment
everybody
looked
toward
tall
jim
phillips
but
larkin
was
fond
of
a
venture
on
unknown
seas
and
so
he
said
i
take
the
master
while
a
buzz
of
surprise
ran
round
the
room
and
the
captain
of
the
other
side
as
if
afraid
his
opponent
would
withdraw
the
choice
retorted
quickly
and
with
a
little
smack
of
exultation
and
defiance
in
his
voice
and
take
jeems
phillips
and
soon
all
present
except
a
few
of
the
old
folks
found
themselves
ranged
in
opposing
hosts
the
poor
spellers
lagging
in
with
what
grace
they
could
at
the
foot
of
the
two
divisions
the
squire
opened
his
and
began
to
give
out
the
words
to
the
two
captains
who
stood
up
and
spelled
against
each
other
it
was
not
long
until
larkin
spelled
really
with
one
and
had
to
sit
down
in
confusion
while
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
ran
through
the
ranks
of
the
opposing
forces
his
own
side
bit
their
lips
the
slender
figure
of
the
young
teacher
took
the
place
of
the
fallen
leader
and
the
excitement
made
the
house
very
quiet
ralph
dreaded
the
loss
of
prestige
he
would
suffer
if
he
should
be
easily
spelled
down
and
at
the
moment
of
rising
he
saw
in
the
darkest
corner
the
figure
of
a
young
man
sitting
in
the
shadow
why
should
his
evil
genius
haunt
him
but
by
a
strong
effort
he
turned
his
attention
away
from
small
and
listened
carefully
to
the
words
which
the
squire
did
not
pronounce
very
distinctly
spelling
them
with
extreme
deliberation
this
gave
him
an
air
of
hesitation
which
disappointed
those
on
his
own
side
they
wanted
him
to
spell
with
a
dashing
assurance
but
he
did
not
begin
a
word
until
he
had
mentally
felt
his
way
through
it
after
ten
minutes
of
spelling
hard
words
jeems
buchanan
the
captain
on
the
other
side
spelled
atrocious
with
an
instead
of
a
and
subsided
his
first
choice
jeems
phillips
coming
up
against
the
teacher
this
brought
the
excitement
to
for
though
ralph
was
chosen
first
it
was
entirely
on
trust
and
most
of
the
company
were
disappointed
the
champion
who
now
stood
up
against
the
was
a
famous
speller
jim
phillips
was
a
tall
lank
fellow
who
had
never
distinguished
himself
in
any
other
pursuit
than
spelling
except
in
this
one
art
of
spelling
he
was
of
no
account
he
could
not
catch
well
or
bat
well
in
ball
he
could
not
throw
well
enough
to
make
his
mark
in
that
famous
west
ern
game
of
he
did
not
succeed
well
in
any
study
but
that
of
webster
elementary
but
in
that
he
was
to
use
the
usual
flat
creek
locution
in
that
he
was
a
boss
this
genius
for
spelling
is
in
some
people
a
sixth
sense
a
matter
of
intuition
some
spellers
are
born
and
not
made
and
their
facility
reminds
one
of
the
mathematical
prodigies
that
crop
out
every
now
and
then
to
bewilder
the
world
bud
means
foreseeing
that
ralph
would
be
pitted
against
jim
phillips
had
warned
his
friend
that
jim
could
spell
like
thunder
and
lightning
and
that
it
took
a
powerful
smart
speller
to
beat
him
for
he
knew
a
heap
of
to
have
spelled
down
the
master
is
next
thing
to
having
whipped
the
biggest
bully
in
hoopole
county
and
jim
had
spelled
down
the
last
three
masters
he
divided
the
of
the
district
with
bud
means
for
half
an
hour
the
squire
gave
out
hard
words
what
a
blessed
thing
our
crooked
orthography
is
without
it
there
could
be
no
as
ralph
discovered
his
opponent
mettle
he
became
more
and
more
cautious
he
was
now
satisfied
that
jim
would
eventually
beat
him
the
fellow
evidently
knew
more
about
the
than
old
noah
webster
himself
as
he
stood
there
with
his
dull
face
and
long
sharp
nose
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
voice
spelling
infallibly
it
seemed
to
hartsook
that
his
superiority
must
lie
in
his
nose
ralph
cautiousness
answered
a
double
purpose
it
enabled
him
to
tread
surely
and
it
was
mistaken
by
jim
for
weakness
phillips
was
now
confident
that
he
should
carry
off
the
scalp
of
the
fourth
before
the
evening
was
over
he
spelled
eagerly
confidently
brilliantly
as
he
was
he
began
to
straighten
up
in
the
minds
of
all
the
company
the
odds
were
in
his
favor
he
saw
this
and
became
ambitious
to
distinguish
himself
by
spelling
without
giving
the
matter
any
thought
ralph
always
believed
that
he
would
have
been
speedily
defeated
by
phillips
had
it
not
been
for
two
thoughts
which
braced
him
the
sinister
shadow
of
young
small
sitting
in
the
dark
corner
by
the
nerved
him
a
victory
over
phillips
was
a
defeat
to
one
who
wished
only
ill
to
the
young
the
other
thought
that
kept
his
pluck
alive
was
the
recollection
of
bull
he
approached
a
word
as
bull
approached
the
raccoon
he
did
not
take
hold
until
he
was
sure
of
his
game
when
he
took
hold
it
was
with
a
quiet
assurance
of
success
as
ralph
spelled
in
this
dogged
way
for
half
an
hour
the
hardest
words
the
squire
could
find
the
excitement
steadily
rose
in
all
parts
of
the
house
and
ralph
friends
even
ventured
to
whisper
that
maybe
jim
had
cotched
his
match
after
all
but
phillips
never
doubted
of
his
success
theodolite
said
the
squire
the
od
theod
o
theodo
theodolite
spelled
the
champion
next
said
the
squire
nearly
losing
his
teeth
in
his
excitement
ralph
spelled
the
word
slowly
and
correctly
and
the
conquered
champion
sat
down
in
confusion
the
excitement
was
so
great
for
some
minutes
that
the
spelling
was
suspended
everybody
in
the
house
had
shown
sympathy
with
one
or
the
other
of
the
combatants
except
the
silent
shadow
in
the
corner
it
had
not
moved
during
the
contest
and
did
not
show
any
interest
now
in
the
result
gewhilliky
crickets
thunder
and
lightning
licked
him
all
to
smash
said
bud
rubbing
his
hands
on
his
knees
that
beats
my
time
all
holler
and
betsey
short
giggled
until
her
fell
out
though
she
was
on
the
defeated
side
shocky
got
up
and
danced
with
pleasure
but
one
suffocating
look
from
the
aqueous
eyes
of
mirandy
destroyed
the
last
spark
of
ralph
pleasure
in
his
triumph
and
sent
that
awful
feeling
all
through
him
he
powerful
smart
is
the
master
said
old
jack
to
pete
jones
he
beat
the
whole
kit
and
tuck
of
afore
he
through
i
he
was
smart
that
the
reason
i
tuck
him
proceeded
means
yaas
but
he
do
lick
enough
not
nigh
answered
pete
jones
no
lickin
no
larnin
says
i
it
was
now
not
so
hard
the
other
spellers
on
the
opposite
side
went
down
quickly
under
the
hard
words
which
the
squire
gave
out
the
master
had
mowed
down
all
but
a
few
his
opponents
had
given
up
the
battle
and
all
had
lost
their
keen
interest
in
a
contest
to
which
there
could
be
but
one
conclusion
for
there
were
only
the
poor
spellers
left
but
ralph
hartsook
ran
against
a
stump
where
he
was
least
expecting
it
it
was
the
squire
custom
when
one
of
the
smaller
scholars
or
poorer
spellers
rose
to
spell
against
the
master
to
give
out
eight
or
ten
easy
words
that
they
might
have
some
before
being
slaughtered
and
then
to
give
a
poser
or
two
which
soon
settled
them
he
let
them
run
a
little
as
a
cat
does
a
doomed
mouse
there
was
now
but
one
person
left
on
the
opposite
side
and
as
she
rose
in
her
blue
calico
dress
ralph
recognized
hannah
the
bound
girl
at
old
jack
means
she
had
not
attended
school
in
the
district
and
had
never
spelled
in
before
and
was
chosen
last
as
an
uncertain
quantity
the
squire
began
with
easy
words
of
two
syllables
from
that
page
of
webster
so
well
known
to
all
who
ever
thumbed
it
as
baker
from
the
word
that
stands
at
the
top
of
the
page
she
spelled
these
words
in
an
absent
and
uninterested
manner
as
everybody
knew
that
she
would
have
to
go
down
as
soon
as
this
preliminary
skirmishing
was
over
everybody
began
to
get
ready
to
go
home
and
already
there
was
the
buzz
of
preparation
young
men
were
timidly
asking
girls
if
they
could
see
them
safe
home
which
was
the
approved
formula
and
were
trembling
in
mortal
fear
of
the
mitten
presently
the
squire
thinking
it
time
to
close
the
contest
pulled
his
scalp
forward
adjusted
his
glass
eye
which
had
been
examining
his
nose
long
enough
and
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
to
the
great
words
at
the
place
known
to
spellers
as
incomprehensibility
and
began
to
give
out
those
words
of
eight
syllables
with
the
accent
on
the
sixth
listless
scholars
now
turned
round
and
ceased
to
whisper
in
order
to
be
in
at
the
master
final
triumph
but
to
their
surprise
ole
miss
meanses
white
nigger
as
some
of
them
called
her
in
allusion
to
her
slavish
life
spelled
these
great
words
with
as
perfect
ease
as
the
master
still
not
doubting
the
result
the
squire
turned
from
place
to
place
and
selected
all
the
hard
words
he
could
find
the
school
became
utterly
quiet
the
excitement
was
too
great
for
the
ordinary
buzz
would
meanses
hanner
beat
the
master
beat
the
master
that
had
laid
out
jim
phillips
everybody
sympathy
was
now
turned
to
hannah
ralph
noticed
that
even
shocky
had
deserted
him
and
that
his
face
grew
brilliant
every
time
hannah
spelled
a
word
in
fact
ralph
deserted
himself
as
he
saw
the
fine
timid
face
of
the
girl
so
long
oppressed
flush
and
shine
with
interest
as
he
looked
at
the
rather
low
but
broad
and
intelligent
brow
and
the
fresh
white
complexion
and
saw
the
rich
womanly
nature
coming
to
the
surface
under
the
influence
of
applause
and
sympathy
he
did
not
want
to
beat
if
he
had
not
felt
that
a
victory
given
would
insult
her
he
would
have
missed
intentionally
the
bulldog
the
stern
relentless
setting
of
the
will
had
gone
he
knew
not
whither
and
there
had
come
in
its
place
as
he
looked
in
that
face
a
something
which
he
did
not
understand
you
did
not
gentle
reader
the
first
time
it
came
to
you
the
squire
was
puzzled
he
had
given
out
all
the
hard
words
in
the
book
he
again
pulled
the
top
of
his
head
forward
then
he
wiped
his
spectacles
and
put
them
on
then
out
of
the
depths
of
his
pocket
he
fished
up
a
list
of
words
just
coming
into
use
in
those
days
words
not
in
the
he
regarded
the
paper
attentively
with
his
blue
right
eye
his
black
left
eye
meanwhile
fixed
itself
in
such
a
stare
on
mirandy
means
that
she
shuddered
and
hid
her
eyes
in
her
red
silk
handkerchief
daguerreotype
sniffed
the
squire
it
was
ralph
turn
dau
next
and
hannah
spelled
it
right
such
a
buzz
followed
that
betsey
short
giggle
could
not
be
heard
but
shocky
shouted
hanner
beat
my
hanner
spelled
down
the
master
and
ralph
went
over
and
congratulated
her
and
small
sat
perfectly
still
in
the
corner
and
then
the
squire
called
them
to
order
and
said
as
our
friend
hanner
thomson
is
the
only
one
left
on
her
side
she
will
have
to
spell
against
nearly
all
on
side
i
shall
therefore
take
the
liberty
of
procrastinating
the
completion
of
this
interesting
and
exacting
contest
until
evening
i
hope
our
friend
hanner
may
again
carry
off
the
cypress
crown
of
glory
there
is
nothing
better
for
us
than
healthful
and
kindly
simulation
small
who
knew
the
road
to
practice
escorted
mirandy
and
bud
went
home
with
somebody
else
the
others
of
the
means
family
hurried
on
while
hannah
the
champion
stayed
behind
a
minute
to
speak
to
shocky
perhaps
it
was
because
ralph
saw
that
hannah
must
go
alone
that
he
suddenly
remembered
having
left
something
which
was
of
no
consequence
and
resolved
to
go
round
by
means
and
get
it
footnotes
footnote
or
peert
is
only
another
form
of
the
old
word
probably
an
older
form
bartlett
cites
an
example
of
as
far
back
as
sir
philip
sidney
and
halliwell
finds
it
in
various
english
dialects
davies
afterward
president
of
princeton
college
describes
lardner
in
as
a
little
pert
old
gent
i
do
not
know
that
daries
pronounced
his
as
though
it
were
but
he
uses
it
in
the
sense
it
has
in
the
text
intelligent
the
general
sense
of
is
lively
either
in
body
or
mind
footnote
lowell
suggested
to
me
in
that
this
word
has
no
kinship
with
but
is
an
independent
word
for
which
he
gave
a
low
latin
original
of
similar
sound
i
have
not
been
able
to
trace
any
such
word
but
lowell
had
so
much
linguistic
knowledge
of
the
sort
that
it
may
be
worth
while
to
record
his
impression
bartlett
is
wrong
in
defining
this
word
as
he
is
usually
in
his
attempts
to
explain
dialect
outside
of
new
england
it
does
not
mean
to
declare
assert
maintain
etc
it
is
nearly
the
equivalent
of
in
the
northern
and
middle
states
and
of
in
the
south
it
agrees
precisely
with
the
new
england
like
all
the
rest
of
these
words
it
may
have
a
strong
sense
by
irony
when
a
man
says
i
that
is
a
purty
peart
sort
of
a
hoss
he
understates
for
the
sake
of
emphasis
it
is
rarely
or
never
but
simply
in
common
with
it
has
sometimes
a
sense
of
purpose
or
expectation
as
when
a
man
says
i
to
go
to
town
footnote
no
phrase
of
the
hoosier
and
dialect
is
such
a
to
the
outsider
as
the
writer
from
the
north
or
east
will
generally
use
it
wrongly
stowe
says
i
sold
right
smart
of
eggs
but
the
hoosier
woman
as
i
knew
her
would
have
said
a
right
smart
lot
of
eggs
or
a
right
smart
of
eggs
using
the
article
and
understanding
the
noun
a
farmer
omitting
the
preposition
boasts
of
having
raised
right
smart
corn
this
year
no
expression
could
have
a
more
vague
sense
than
this
in
the
early
settlement
of
minnesota
it
was
a
custom
of
the
land
officers
to
require
a
residence
of
about
ten
days
on
a
claim
in
order
to
the
establishment
of
a
right
one
of
the
receivers
at
a
land
office
under
buchanan
administration
was
a
german
of
much
intelligence
who
was
very
sensitive
regarding
his
knowledge
of
english
how
long
has
the
claimant
lived
on
his
claim
he
demanded
of
a
hoosier
witness
oh
a
right
smart
while
was
the
reply
the
receiver
had
not
the
faintest
notion
of
the
meaning
of
the
answer
but
fearing
to
betray
his
ignorance
of
english
he
allowed
the
land
to
be
entered
though
the
claimant
had
spent
but
about
two
hours
in
residing
on
his
chapter
the
walk
home
you
expect
me
to
describe
that
walk
you
have
had
enough
of
the
jack
meanses
and
the
squire
hawkinses
and
the
pete
joneses
and
the
rest
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
now
of
this
girl
and
her
lover
of
how
the
silvery
moonbeams
came
down
in
a
shower
to
use
favorite
metaphor
through
the
maple
boughs
flecking
the
frozen
ground
with
light
and
shadow
you
would
have
me
tell
of
the
evening
star
not
yet
gone
down
which
shed
its
benediction
on
them
but
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
for
the
moon
was
not
shining
neither
did
the
stars
give
their
light
the
tall
black
trunks
of
the
maples
swayed
and
shook
in
the
wind
which
moaned
through
their
leafless
boughs
novelists
always
make
lovers
walk
in
the
moonlight
but
if
love
is
not
as
the
cynics
believe
all
moonshine
it
can
at
least
make
its
own
light
moonlight
is
never
so
little
needed
or
heeded
never
so
much
of
an
impertinence
as
in
a
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
hollow
beyond
the
that
ralph
overtook
the
timid
girl
walking
swiftly
through
the
dark
he
did
not
ask
permission
to
walk
with
her
love
does
not
go
by
words
and
there
are
times
when
conventionality
is
impossible
there
are
people
who
understand
one
another
at
once
when
one
soul
meets
another
it
is
not
by
nor
by
hailing
sign
nor
by
mysterious
grip
that
they
recognize
the
subtlest
freemasonry
in
the
world
is
this
freemasonry
of
the
spirit
ralph
and
hannah
knew
and
trusted
ralph
had
admired
and
wondered
at
the
quiet
drudge
but
it
was
when
in
the
unaccustomed
sunshine
of
praise
she
spread
her
wings
a
little
that
he
loved
her
he
had
seen
her
awake
you
miss
amelia
wish
me
to
repeat
all
their
i
am
afraid
you
find
it
dull
love
can
pipe
through
any
kind
of
a
reed
ralph
talked
love
to
hannah
when
he
spoke
of
the
weather
of
the
crops
of
the
weather
crops
and
these
were
what
his
words
would
say
if
reported
but
below
all
these
commonplaces
there
vibrated
something
else
one
can
make
love
a
great
deal
better
when
one
does
speak
of
love
words
are
so
poor
tones
and
modulations
are
better
it
is
an
old
story
that
whitefield
could
make
an
audience
weep
by
his
way
of
pronouncing
the
word
mesopotamia
a
lover
can
sound
the
whole
gamut
of
his
affection
in
saying
the
solemnest
engagements
ever
made
have
been
without
the
intervention
of
speech
and
you
my
gradgrind
friend
you
think
me
sentimental
two
young
fools
they
were
walking
so
slowly
though
the
night
was
sharp
dallying
under
the
trees
and
dreaming
of
a
heaven
they
could
not
have
realized
if
all
their
wishes
had
been
granted
of
course
they
were
fools
either
they
were
fools
to
be
so
happy
or
else
some
other
people
are
fools
not
to
be
after
all
dear
gradgrind
let
them
be
there
no
harm
in
it
they
get
trouble
enough
before
morning
let
them
enjoy
the
evening
i
am
not
sure
but
these
lovers
whom
we
write
down
fools
are
the
only
wise
people
after
all
is
it
not
wise
to
be
happy
let
them
alone
for
the
first
time
in
three
years
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
old
jack
means
and
come
under
the
domination
of
old
jack
means
hannah
talked
cheerfully
almost
gayly
it
was
something
to
have
a
companion
to
talk
to
it
was
something
to
be
the
victor
even
in
a
and
to
be
applauded
even
by
flat
creek
and
so
chatting
earnestly
about
the
most
uninteresting
themes
ralph
courteously
helped
hannah
over
the
fence
and
they
took
the
usual
through
the
pasture
there
came
up
a
little
shower
hardly
more
than
a
sprinkle
but
then
it
was
so
nice
to
have
a
shower
just
as
they
reached
the
tree
by
the
spring
it
was
so
thoughtful
in
ralph
to
suggest
that
the
shade
of
a
is
dense
and
that
hannah
might
take
cold
and
it
was
so
easy
for
hannah
to
yield
to
the
suggestion
just
as
though
she
had
not
milked
the
cows
in
the
open
lot
in
the
worst
storms
of
the
last
three
years
and
just
as
though
the
house
were
not
within
a
doubtless
it
was
not
prudent
to
stop
here
but
let
us
deal
gently
with
them
who
would
not
stay
in
an
earthy
paradise
ten
minutes
longer
even
though
it
did
make
purgatory
the
hotter
afterward
and
so
hannah
stayed
tell
me
your
circumstances
said
ralph
at
last
i
am
sure
i
can
help
you
in
something
no
no
you
can
not
and
hannah
face
was
clouded
no
one
can
help
me
only
time
and
god
i
must
go
mr
hartsook
and
they
walked
on
to
the
front
gate
in
silence
and
in
some
constraint
but
still
in
happiness
as
they
came
to
the
gate
small
pushed
past
them
in
his
cool
deliberate
way
and
mounted
his
horse
ralph
bade
hannah
having
entirely
forgotten
the
errand
which
had
been
his
excuse
to
himself
for
coming
out
of
his
way
he
hastened

clifty
waked
up
for

over

idea
of

caught
allowing

a

you
bud
did
not
say
another
word
he
sat
in
the
and
whistled
dandy
jim
from
caroline
his
diversion
had
produced
the
effect
he
sought
for
while
his
mother
poured
her
broadside
into
his
feelings
hannah
had
slipped
up
the
stairs
to
her
garret
bedroom
and
when
means
turned
from
the
callous
bud
to
finish
her
assault
upon
the
sensitive
girl
she
could
only
gnash
her
teeth
in
disappointment
stung
by
the
insults
to
which
she
could
not
grow
insensible
hannah
lay
awake
until
the
memory
of
that
walk
through
the
darkness
came
into
her
soul
like
a
benediction
the
harsh
voice
of
the
scold
died
out
and
the
gentle
and
courteous
voice
of
hartsook
filled
her
soul
she
recalled
piece
by
piece
the
whole
conversation
all
the
commonplace
remarks
about
the
weather
all
the
insignificant
remarks
about
the
crops
all
the
unimportant
words
about
the
not
for
the
sake
of
the
remarks
not
for
the
sake
of
the
weather
not
for
the
sake
of
the
crops
not
for
the
sake
of
the
but
for
the
sake
of
the
undertone
and
then
she
traveled
back
over
the
three
years
of
her
bondage
and
forward
over
the
three
years
to
come
and
fed
her
heart
on
the
dim
hope
of
rebuilding
in
some
form
the
home
that
had
been
so
happy
and
she
prayed
with
more
faith
than
ever
before
for
deliverance
for
love
brings
faith
somewhere
on
in
the
sleepless
night
she
stood
at
the
window
the
moon
was
shining
now
and
there
was
the
path
through
the
pasture
and
there
was
the
fence
and
there
was
the
she
sat
there
a
long
time
then
she
saw
someone
come
over
the
fence
and
walk
to
the
tree
and
then
on
toward
pete
jones
who
could
it
be
she
thought
she
recognized
the
figure
but
she
was
chilled
and
shivering
and
she
crept
back
again
into
bed
and
dreamed
not
of
the
uncertain
days
to
come
but
of
the
blessed
days
that
were
past
of
a
father
and
a
mother
and
a
brother
in
a
happy
home
but
somehow
the
was
there
too
chapter
vi
a
night
at
pete
jones
when
ralph
got
to
pete
jones
he
found
that
individual
in
the
act
of
kicking
one
of
his
many
dogs
out
of
the
house
come
in
stranger
come
in
you
find
this
house
full
of
brats
but
i
guess
you
kin
kick
your
way
around
among
take
a
cheer
here
git
out
go
to
thunder
with
you
and
with
these
mild
imperatives
he
boxed
one
of
his
boys
over
in
one
direction
and
one
of
his
girls
over
in
the
other
i
believe
in
trainin
up
children
to
mind
when
they
spoke
to
he
said
to
ralph
apologetically
but
it
seemed
to
the
teacher
that
he
wanted
them
to
mind
just
a
little
before
they
were
spoken
to
you
like
a
bed
well
jest
climb
up
the
ladder
on
the
outside
of
the
house
takes
up
a
thunderin
sight
of
room
to
have
a
stairs
inside
and
we
got
no
room
to
spare
you
find
a
bed
in
the
furdest
corner
my
pete
already
got
half
of
it
and
you
can
take
half
ef
pete
goes
to
takin
his
half
in
the
middle
and
to
make
you
take
yourn
on
both
sides
jest
kick
him
in
this
comfortless
bed
in
the
furdest
corner
ralph
found
sleep
out
of
the
question
pete
took
of
the
bed
and
hannah
took
all
of
his
thoughts
so
he
lay
and
looked
out
through
the
cracks
in
the
clapboards
as
they
call
rough
shingles
in
the
old
west
at
the
stars
for
the
clouds
had
now
broken
away
and
he
lay
thus
recounting
to
himself
as
a
miser
counts
the
pieces
that
compose
his
hoard
every
step
of
that
road
from
the
time
he
had
overtaken
hannah
in
the
hollow
to
the
fence
then
he
imagined
again
the
pleasure
of
helping
her
over
and
then
he
retraced
the
ground
to
the
tree
at
the
spring
and
repeated
to
himself
the
conversation
until
he
came
to
the
part
in
which
she
said
that
only
time
and
god
could
help
her
what
did
she
mean
what
was
the
hidden
part
of
her
life
what
was
the
connection
between
her
and
shocky
hours
wore
on
and
still
the
mind
of
ralph
hartsook
went
back
and
traveled
the
same
road
over
the
fence
past
the
up
to
the
inexplicable
part
of
the
conversation
and
stood
bewildered
with
the
same
puzzling
questions
about
the
bound
girl
life
at
last
he
got
up
drew
on
his
clothes
and
sat
down
on
the
top
of
the
ladder
looking
down
over
the
pasture
which
lay
on
the
border
between
the
land
of
jones
and
the
land
of
means
the
earth
was
white
with
moonlight
he
could
not
sleep
why
not
walk
it
might
enable
him
to
sleep
and
once
determined
on
walking
he
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
as
to
the
direction
in
which
he
should
walk
the
pasture
was
it
not
like
unto
the
garden
of
eden
lay
right
before
him
that
stood
just
in
sight
to
spring
over
the
fence
and
take
the
path
down
the
hill
and
over
the
brook
was
as
quickly
done
as
decided
upon
to
stand
again
under
the
to
climb
again
over
the
farther
fence
and
to
walk
down
the
road
toward
the
was
so
easy
and
so
delightful
that
it
was
done
without
thought
for
ralph
was
an
eager
man
when
he
saw
no
wrong
in
anything
that
proposed
itself
he
was
wont
to
follow
his
impulse
without
deliberation
and
this
keeping
company
with
the
stars
and
the
memory
of
a
delightful
walk
were
so
much
better
than
the
commonplace
flat
creek
life
that
he
threw
himself
into
his
night
excursion
with
enthusiasm
at
last
he
stood
in
the
little
hollow
where
he
had
joined
hannah
it
was
the
very
spot
at
which
shocky
too
had
met
him
a
few
mornings
before
he
leaned
against
the
fence
and
tried
again
to
solve
the
puzzle
of
hannah
troubles
for
that
she
had
troubles
he
did
not
doubt
neither
did
he
doubt
that
he
could
help
her
if
he
could
discover
what
they
were
but
he
had
no
clue
in
the
midst
of
this
meditations
he
heard
the
thud
of
horses
hoofs
coming
down
the
road
until
that
moment
he
had
not
felt
his
own
loneliness
he
shrank
back
into
the
the
horsemen
were
galloping
there
were
three
of
them
and
there
was
one
figure
that
seemed
familiar
to
ralph
but
he
could
not
tell
who
it
was
neither
could
he
remember
having
seen
the
horse
which
was
a
sorrel
with
a
white
left
forefoot
and
a
white
nose
the
men
noticed
him
and
reined
up
a
little
why
he
should
have
been
startled
by
the
presence
of
these
men
he
could
not
tell
but
an
indefinable
dread
seized
him
they
galloped
on
and
he
stood
still
shivering
with
a
nervous
fear
the
cold
seemed
to
have
got
into
his
bones
he
remembered
that
the
region
lying
on
flat
creek
and
clifty
creek
had
the
reputation
of
being
infested
with
thieves
who
practiced
and
for
ever
since
the
day
when
murrell
confederate
bands
were
paralyzed
by
the
death
of
their
leader
there
have
still
existed
gangs
of
desperadoes
in
parts
of
southern
indiana
and
illinois
and
in
iowa
missouri
kentucky
and
the
southwest
it
is
out
of
these
materials
that
border
ruffianism
has
grown
and
the
nine
members
of
the
reno
band
who
were
hanged
two
or
three
years
ago
by
lynch
law
were
remains
of
the
bad
blood
that
came
into
the
west
in
the
days
of
daniel
boone
shall
i
not
say
that
these
bands
of
desperadoes
still
found
among
the
poor
whitey
class
are
the
outcroppings
of
the
bad
blood
sent
from
england
in
ought
an
old
country
to
sow
the
fertile
soil
of
a
colony
with
such
noxious
seed
before
ralph
was
able
to
move
he
heard
the
hoofs
of
another
horse
striking
upon
the
hard
ground
in
an
easy
pace
the
rider
was
small
he
checked
his
horse
in
a
cool
way
and
stood
still
a
few
seconds
while
he
scrutinized
ralph
then
he
rode
on
keeping
the
same
easy
gait
as
before
ralph
had
a
superstitious
horror
of
henry
small
and
shuddering
with
cold
he
crept
like
a
thief
over
the
fence
past
the
tree
through
the
pasture
back
to
pete
jones
never
once
thinking
of
the
eyes
that
looked
out
of
the
window
at
means
climbing
the
ladder
he
got
into
bed
and
shook
as
with
the
ague
he
tried
to
reason
himself
out
of
the
foolish
terror
that
possessed
him
but
he
could
not
half
an
hour
later
he
heard
a
latch
raised
were
the
robbers
breaking
into
the
house
below
he
heard
a
soft
tread
upon
the
floor
should
he
rise
and
give
the
alarm
something
restrained
him
he
reflected
that
a
robber
would
be
sure
to
stumble
over
some
of
the
brats
so
he
lay
still
and
finally
slumbered
only
awakening
when
the
place
in
which
he
slept
was
full
of
the
smoke
of
frying
grease
from
the
room
below
at
breakfast
pete
jones
scowled
he
was
evidently
angry
about
something
he
treated
ralph
with
a
rudeness
not
to
be
overlooked
as
if
he
intended
to
bring
on
a
quarrel
hartsook
kept
cool
and
wished
he
could
drive
from
his
mind
all
memory
of
the
past
night
why
should
men
on
horseback
have
any
significance
to
him
he
was
trying
to
regard
things
in
this
way
and
from
a
general
desire
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
his
host
he
went
to
the
stable
to
offer
his
services
in
helping
to
feed
the
stock
do
want
no
help
was
all
he
got
in
return
for
his
offer
but
just
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
stable
he
saw
what
made
him
tremble
again
there
was
the
same
sorrel
horse
with
a
white
left
forefoot
and
a
white
nose
to
shake
off
his
nervousness
ralph
started
to
school
before
the
time
but
plague
upon
plagues
mirandy
means
who
had
seen
him
leave
pete
jones
started
just
in
time
to
join
him
where
he
came
into
the
big
road
ralph
was
not
in
a
good
humor
after
his
wakeful
night
and
to
be
thus
dogged
by
mirandy
did
not
help
the
matter
so
he
found
himself
speaking
crabbedly
to
the
daughter
of
the
leading
trustee
in
spite
of
himself
hanner
got
a
bad
cold
this
mornin
from
bein
out
last
night
and
she
ca
come
to
began
mirandy
in
her
most
simpering
voice
ralph
had
forgotten
that
there
was
to
be
another
it
seemed
to
him
an
age
since
the
orthographical
conflict
of
the
past
night
this
remark
of
mirandy
fell
upon
his
ear
like
an
echo
from
the
distant
past
he
had
lived
a
lifetime
since
and
was
not
sure
that
he
was
the
same
man
who
was
spelling
for
dear
life
against
jim
phillips
twelve
hours
before
but
he
was
sorry
to
hear
that
hannah
had
a
cold
it
seemed
to
him
in
his
depressed
state
that
he
was
to
blame
for
it
in
fact
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
to
blame
for
a
good
many
things
he
seemed
to
have
been
committing
sins
in
spite
of
himself
broken
nerves
and
sleepless
nights
often
result
in
a
morbid
conscience
and
what
business
had
he
to
wander
over
this
very
road
at
two
in
the
morning
and
to
see
three
galloping
horsemen
one
of
them
on
a
horse
with
a
white
left
forefoot
and
a
white
nose
what
business
had
he
watching
small
as
he
went
home
from
the
bedside
of
a
dying
patient
near
daylight
in
the
morning
and
because
he
felt
guilty
he
felt
cross
with
mirandy
and
to
her
remark
about
hannah
he
only
replied
that
hannah
was
a
smart
girl
yes
said
mirandy
bud
thinks
so
does
he
said
ralph
i
should
say
so
what
him
and
her
been
fer
for
a
year
ef
he
did
think
she
was
smart
marm
do
like
it
but
ef
bud
and
her
does
and
they
seem
to
i
do
see
as
it
marm
lookout
when
one
is
wretched
there
is
a
pleasure
in
being
entirely
wretched
ralph
felt
that
he
must
have
committed
some
unknown
crime
and
that
some
nemesis
was
following
him
was
hannah
deceitful
at
least
if
she
were
not
he
felt
sure
that
he
could
supplant
bud
but
what
right
had
he
to
supplant
bud
did
you
hear
the
news
cried
shocky
running
out
to
meet
him
the
dutchman
house
was
robbed
last
night
ralph
thought
of
the
three
men
on
horseback
and
to
save
his
life
he
could
not
help
associating
small
with
them
and
then
he
remembered
the
sorrel
horse
with
the
left
forefoot
and
muzzle
white
and
he
recalled
the
sound
he
had
heard
as
of
the
lifting
of
a
latch
and
it
really
seemed
to
him
that
in
knowing
what
he
did
he
was
in
some
sense
guilty
of
the
robbery

ominous
remarks
of
jones
the
mind
was
like
ancient
gaul
divided
into
three
parts
with
one
part
he
mechanically
performed
his
school
duties
with
another
he
asked
himself
what
shall
i
do
about
the
robbery
and
with
the
third
he
debated
about
bud
and
hannah
for
bud
was
not
present
and
it
was
clear
that
he
was
angry
and
there
was
a
storm
brewing
in
fact
it
seemed
to
ralph
that
there
was
a
storm
brewing
all
round
the
sky
for
pete
jones
was
evidently
angry
at
the
thought
of
having
been
watched
and
it
was
fair
to
suppose
that
small
was
not
in
any
better
humor
than
usual
and
so
between
bud
jealousy
and
revenge
and
the
suspicion
and
resentment
of
the
men
engaged
in
the
robbery
at
the
dutchman
as
the
only
german
in
the
whole
region
was
called
ralph
excited
nerves
had
cause
for
tremor
at
one
moment
he
would
resolve
to
have
hannah
at
all
costs
in
the
next
his
conscience
would
question
the
rightfulness
of
the
conclusion
then
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
tell
all
he
knew
about
the
robbery
but
if
he
told
his
suspicions
about
small
nobody
would
believe
him
and
if
he
told
about
pete
jones
he
really
could
tell
only
enough
to
bring
vengeance
upon
himself
and
how
could
he
explain
his
own
walk
through
the
pasture
and
down
the
road
what
business
had
he
being
out
of
bed
at
two
in
the
morning
the
circumstantial
evidence
was
quite
as
strong
against
him
as
against
the
man
on
the
horse
with
the
white
left
forefoot
and
the
white
nose
suspicion
might
fasten
on
himself
and
then
what
would
be
the
effect
on
his
prospects
on
the
people
at
lewisburg
on
hannah
it
is
astonishing
how
much
instruction
and
comfort
there
is
in
a
bulldog
this
slender
who
had
been
all
his
life
repressing
the
animal
and
developing
the
finer
nature
now
found
a
need
of
just
what
the
bulldog
had
and
so
with
the
thought
of
how
his
friend
the
dog
would
fight
in
a
desperate
strait
he
determined
to
take
hold
of
his
difficulties
as
bull
took
hold
of
the
raccoon
moral
questions
he
postponed
for
careful
decision
but
for
the
present
he
set
his
teeth
together
in
a
desperate
bulldog
fashion
and
he
set
his
feet
down
slowly
positively
bulldoggedly
after
a
wretched
supper
at
pete
jones
he
found
himself
at
the
which
owing
to
the
absence
of
hannah
and
the
excitement
about
the
burglary
was
a
dull
affair
half
the
evening
was
spent
in
talking
in
little
knots
pete
jones
had
taken
the
afflicted
dutchman
under
his
own
particular
supervision
i
said
pete
that
them
air
fellers

a

said
pete
ralph
wondered
whether
he
bet
the
one
with
the
white
left
forefoot
and
the
white
nose
now
said
pete
ef
i
could

and
betsey
short
who
had
found
the
whole
affair
very
funny
was
transported
with
a
fit
of
tittering
at
poor
schroeder
english
ralph
fearing
that
his
silence
would
excite
suspicion
tried
to
talk
but
he
could
not
tell
what
he
knew
and
all
that
he
said
sounded
so
hollow
and
hypocritical
that
it
made
him
feel
guilty
and
so
he
shut
his
mouth
and
meditated
profitably
on
the
subject
of
bull
dogs
and
when
later
he
overheard
the
garrulous
jones
declare
that
he
bet
a
hoss
he
could
out
somebody
as
know
a
blamed
sight
they
keerd
to
tell
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
it
came
to
out
he
should
try
to
be
even
with
jones
chapter
viii
the
struggle
in
the
dark
it
was
a
long
lonesome
fearful
night
that
the
passed
lying
with
nerves
on
edge
and
eyes
wide
open
in
that
comfortless
bed
in
the
furdest
corner
of
the
loft
of
pete
jones
house
shivering
with
cold
while
the
light
snow
that
was
falling
sifted
in
upon
the
ragged
quilt
that
covered
him
nerves
broken
by
sleeplessness
imagine
many
things
and
for
the
first
hour
ralph
felt
sure
that
pete
would
cut
his
throat
before
morning
and
you
friend
callow
who
have
blunted
your
palate
by
swallowing
the
cayenne
pepper
of
the
you
wish
me
to
make
this
night
exciting
by
a
contest
between
ralph
and
a
robber
you
would
like
it
better
if
there
were
a
there
nothing
so
convenient
as
a
unless
it
be
a
subterranean
passage
and
you
like
something
of
that
sort
just
here
it
so
pleasant
to
have
one
hair
stand
on
end
you
know
when
one
is
safe
from
danger
to
one
self
but
if
you
want
each
individual
hair
to
bristle
with
such
a
struggle
in
the
dark
you
can
buy
and
subterranean
passages
dirt
cheap
at
the
next
but
it
was
indeed
a
real
and
terrible
struggle
in
the
dark
that
ralph
fought
out
at
pete
jones
when
he
had
vanquished
his
fears
of
personal
violence
by
reminding
himself
that
it
would
be
folly
for
jones
to
commit
murder
in
his
own
house
the
question
of
bud
and
hannah
took
the
uppermost
place
in
his
thoughts
and
as
the
image
of
hannah
spelling
against
the
master
came
up
to
him
as
the
memory
of
the
walk
the
talk
the
tree
and
all
the
rest
took
possession
of
him
it
seemed
to
ralph
that
his
very
life
depended
upon
his
securing
her
love
he
would
shut
his
teeth
like
the
jaws
of
a
bulldog
and
all
bud
muscles
should
not
prevail
over
his
resolution
and
his
stratagems
it
was
easy
to
persuade
himself
that
this
was
right
hannah
ought
not
to
throw
herself
away
on
bud
means
men
of
some
culture
always
play
their
conceit
off
against
their
consciences
to
a
man
of
literary
habits
it
usually
seems
to
be
a
great
boon
that
he
confers
on
a
woman
when
he
gives
her
his
love
reasoning
thus
ralph
had
fixed
his
resolution
and
if
the
night
had
been
shorter
or
sleep
possible
the
color
of
his
life
might
have
been
changed
but
some
time
along
in
the
tedious
hours
came
the
memory
of
his
childhood
the
words
of
his
mother
the
old
bible
stories
the
aspiration
after
nobility
of
spirit
the
solemn
resolutions
to
be
true
to
his
conscience
these
angels
of
the
memory
came
flocking
back
before
the
animal
the
had
set
as
workers
in
plaster
say
he
remembered
the
story
of
david
and
nathan
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
with
all
his
abilities
and
ambitions
and
prospects
was
about
to
rob
bud
of
the
one
the
only
thing
he
had
to
rejoice
in
in
his
life
in
getting
hannah
he
would
make
himself
unworthy
of
hannah
and
then
there
came
to
him
a
vision
of
the
supreme
value
of
a
true
character
how
it
was
better
than
success
better
than
to
be
loved
better
than
heaven
and
how
near
he
had
been
to
missing
it
and
how
certain
he
was
when
these
thoughts
should
fade
to
miss
it
he
was
as
one
fighting
for
a
great
prize
who
feels
his
strength
failing
and
is
sure
of
defeat
this
was
the
real
awful
struggle
in
the
dark
a
human
soul
fighting
with
heaven
in
sight
but
certain
of
slipping
inevitably
into
hell
it
was
the
same
old
battle
the
image
of
god
fought
with
the
image
of
the
devil
it
was
the
same
fight
that
paul
described
so
dramatically
when
he
represented
the
spirit
as
contending
with
the
flesh
paul
also
called
this
dreadful
something
the
old
adam
and
i
suppose
darwin
would
call
it
the
remains
of
the
wild
beast
but
call
it
what
you
will
it
is
the
battle
that
every
soul
must
fight
at
some
point
and
to
ralph
it
seemed
that
the
final
victory
of
the
evil
the
old
adam
the
flesh
the
wild
beast
the
devil
was
certain
for
was
not
the
pure
unconscious
face
of
hannah
on
the
devil
side
and
so
the
battle
had
just
as
well
be
given
up
at
once
for
it
must
be
lost
in
the
end
but
to
ralph
lying
there
in
the
still
darkness
with
his
conscience
as
wide
awake
as
if
it
were
the
day
of
doom
there
seemed
something
so
terrible
in
this
overflow
of
the
better
nature
which
he
knew
to
be
inevitable
as
soon
as
the
voice
of
conscience
became
blunted
that
he
looked
about
for
help
he
did
not
at
first
think
of
god
but
there
came
into
his
thoughts
the
memory
of
a
galilean
peasant
hungry
sleepy
weary
tempted
tried
like
other
men
but
having
a
strange
divine
victory
in
him
by
which
everything
evil
was
vanquished
at
his
coming
he
remembered
how
he
had
reached
out
a
hand
to
every
helpless
one
how
he
was
the
helper
of
every
weak
one
and
out
of
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
cried
to
the
helper
and
found
comfort
not
victory
but
what
is
better
strength
and
so
without
a
thought
of
the
niceties
of
theological
distinctions
without
dreaming
that
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
religious
experience
he
found
what
he
needed
help
and
the
helper
gave
his
beloved
sleep
chapter
ix
has
god
forgotten
shocky
pap
wants
to
know
ef
you
would
spend
and
sunday
at
our
house
said
one
of
squire
hawkins
girls
on
the
very
next
evening
which
was
friday
the
old
squire
was
thoughtful
enough
to
remember
that
ralph
would
not
find
it
very
pleasant
boarding
out
all
the
time
he
was
entitled
to
spend
at
pete
jones
for
in
view
of
the
fact
that
pete
jones
sent
seven
children
to
the
school
the
master
in
flat
creek
district
was
bound
to
spend
two
weeks
in
that
comfortable
place
sleeping
in
a
preoccupied
bed
in
the
furdest
corner
with
insufficient
cover
under
an
insufficient
roof
and
eating
floating
islands
of
salt
pork
fished
out
of
oceans
of
hot
lard
ralph
was
not
slow
to
accept
the
relief
offered
by
the
hospitable
justice
of
the
peace
whose
principal
business
seemed
to
be
the
adjustment
of
the
pieces
of
which
he
was
composed
and
as
shocky
traveled
the
same
road
ralph
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
talk
with
him
the
master
could
not
dismiss
hannah
wholly
from
his
mind
he
would
at
least
read
the
mystery
of
her
life
if
shocky
could
be
prevailed
on
to
furnish
the
clue
poor
old
tree
said
shocky
pointing
to
a
crooked
and
gnarled
elm
standing
by
itself
in
the
middle
of
a
field
for
when
the
elm
naturally
the
most
graceful
of
trees
once
gets
a
bad
set
it
can
grow
to
be
the
most
deformed
this
solitary
tree
had
not
a
single
straight
limb
why
do
you
say
old
tree
asked
ralph
it
lonesome
all
its
old
friends
is
dead
and
chopped
down
and
there
their
stumps
jes
like
it
be
lonesome
some
folks
says
it
do
feel
but
i
think
it
does
everything
seems
to
think
and
feel
see
it
nodding
its
head
to
them
other
trees
in
the
woods
and
to
shake
hands
but
it
ca
move
i
think
that
tree
must
a
growed
in
the
night
why
shocky
it
so
crooked
and
shocky
laughed
at
his
own
conceit
must
a
growed
when
they
was
no
light
so
as
it
could
see
how
to
grow
and
then
they
walked
on
in
silence
a
minute
presently
shocky
began
looking
up
into
ralph
eyes
to
get
a
smile
i
guess
that
tree
feels
just
like
me
do
you
why
how
do
you
feel
kind
o
bad
and
lonesome
and
like
as
if
i
wanted
to
die
you
know
felt
that
way
ever
sence
they
put
my
father
into
the
graveyard
and
sent
my
mother
to
the
and
hanner
to
ole
miss
means
what
kind
of
a
place
is
a
is
it
a
poorer
place
than
means
i
wish
i
was
dead
and
one
of
them
clouds
was
me
and
hanner
and
mother
up
to
where
father
gone
you
know
i
wonder
if
god
forgets
all
about
poor
folks
when
their
father
dies
and
their
mother
gits
into
the
do
you
think
he
does
seems
so
to
me
maybe
god
lost
track
of
my
father
when
he
come
away
from
england
and
crossed
over
the
sea
do
nobody
on
flat
creek
keer
fer
god
and
i
guess
god
do
keer
fer
flat
creek
but
i
would
though
ef
he
git
my
mother
out
of
the
and
git
hanner
away
from
means
and
let
me
kiss
my
mother
every
night
you
know
and
sleep
on
my
hanner
arm
jes
like
i
used
to
afore
father
died
you
see
ralph
wanted
to
speak
but
he
could
and
so
shocky
with
his
eyes
looking
straight
ahead
and
as
if
forgetting
ralph
presence
told
over
the
thoughts
that
he
had
often
talked
over
to
the
and
the
trees
it
was
real
good
in
pearson
to
take
me
was
it
else
a
been
bound
out
tell
i
was
maybe
to
some
mean
man
like
ole
means
and
i
but
seven
and
it
would
take
me
fourteen
years
to
git
and
i
never
could
live
with
my
mother
again
after
hanner
gets
done
her
time
you
see
hanner
be
through
in
three
more
year
and
i
be
ten
and
able
to
work
and
we
git
a
little
place
about
as
big
as
granny
sanders
and
ralph
did
not
hear
another
word
of
what
shocky
said
that
afternoon
for
there
right
before
them
was
granny
sanders
with
its
row
of
lofty
sunflower
stalks
now
dead
and
dry
in
front
with
its
barrel
by
the
side
of
the
low
door
and
its
by
the
fence
in
this
cabin
lived
alone
the
old
and
shriveled
hag
whose
hideousness
gave
her
a
reputation
for
almost
supernatural
knowledge
she
was
at
once
doctress
and
newspaper
she
collected
and
disseminated
medicinal
herbs
and
personal
gossip
she
was
in
every
regard
indispensable
to
the
intellectual
life
of
the
neighborhood
in
the
matter
of
her
medical
skill
we
can
not
express
an
opinion
for
her
yarbs
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
pharmacopoeia
of
science
what
took
ralph
breath
was
to
find
small
fine
faultless
horse
standing
at
the
door
what
did
henry
small
want
to
visit
this
old
quack
for
chapter
x
the
devil
of
silence
ralph
had
reason
to
fear
small
who
was
a
native
of
the
same
village
of
lewisburg
and
some
five
years
the
elder
some
facts
in
the
life
had
come
into
ralph
possession
in
such
a
way
as
to
confirm
suspicion
without
giving
him
power
to
expose
small
who
was
firmly
intrenched
in
the
good
graces
of
the
people
of
the
village
of
lewisburg
where
he
had
grown
up
and
of
the
little
village
of
clifty
where
his
shingle
now
hung
small
was
no
ordinary
villain
he
was
a
genius
your
ordinary
hypocrite
talks
cant
small
talked
nothing
he
was
the
coolest
the
steadiest
the
most
silent
the
most
promising
boy
ever
born
in
lewisburg
he
made
no
pretensions
he
set
up
no
claims
he
uttered
no
professions
he
went
right
on
and
lived
a
life
above
reproach
your
vulgar
hypocrite
makes
long
prayers
in
small
did
nothing
of
the
sort
he
sat
still
in
and
listened
to
the
elders
as
a
modest
young
man
should
your
commonplace
hypocrite
boasts
small
never
alluded
to
himself
and
thus
a
consummate
egotist
got
credit
for
modesty
it
is
but
an
indifferent
trick
for
a
hypocrite
to
make
temperance
speeches
small
did
not
even
belong
to
a
temperance
society
but
he
could
never
be
persuaded
to
drink
even
so
much
as
a
cup
of
tea
there
was
something
sublime
in
the
quiet
voice
with
which
he
would
say
cold
water
if
you
please
to
a
lady
tempting
him
with
smoking
coffee
on
a
cold
morning
there
was
no
exultation
no
sense
of
merit
in
the
act
everything
was
done
in
a
modest
and
way
beautiful
to
behold
and
his
face
was
a
neutral
tint
neither
face
nor
voice
expressed
anything
only
a
keen
reader
of
character
might
have
asked
whether
all
there
was
in
that
eye
could
live
contented
with
this
cool
austere
life
whether
there
would
not
be
somewhere
a
volcanic
eruption
but
if
there
was
any
sea
of
molten
lava
beneath
the
world
did
not
discover
it
wild
boys
were
sick
of
having
small
held
up
to
them
as
the
most
immaculate
of
men
ralph
had
failed
to
get
two
schools
for
which
he
had
applied
and
had
attributed
both
failures
to
certain
shrugs
of
small
and
now
when
he
found
small
at
the
house
of
granny
sanders
the
center
of
intelligence
as
well
as
of
ignorance
for
the
neighborhood
he
trembled
not
that
small

you
fer
a
man
of
intelligence

his
grave
silence
and
attention

almost
smothered
the
old
hag
with
flattery
many
the
case

cured
with
yarbs
and
things
nigh
upon
twenty
year
ago
they
was
a

well
the
man
was
goin
to
die
everybody
seed
that
and
they
come
away
over
here
all
the
way
from
the
wild
cat
think
of
that
air
i
never
was
so
flustered
but
as
soon
as
i
laid
eyes
on
that
air
man
i
says

i
that
air
man
says
i

got

minute

and
if

him
i

so
i
jist
killed
a
black
cat
and
let
the
blood
run
all
over
the
swellin
i
tell
you
doctor
nothin
like
it
that
man
was
well
in
a
month
illustration
means
did
you
use
the
blood
warm
asked
small
with
a
solemnity
most
edifying
these
were
almost
the
only
words
he
had
uttered
since
he
entered
the
cabin
laws
yes
i
jest
let
it
run
right
out
of
the
cat
tail
onto
the
and
fer
airesipelus
i
do
know
nothin
so
good
as
the
blood
of
a
black
hen
how
old
asked
the
doctor
there
you
showed
yer
science
doctor
they
no
power
in
a
pullet
the
older
the
black
hen
the
better
and
you
know
the
cure
fer
rheumatiz
and
here
the
old
woman
got
down
a
bottle
of
grease
that
ile
from
a
black
dog
ef
it
rendered
right
it
knock
the
hind
sights
off
of
any
rheumatiz
you
ever
see
but
it
must
be
rendered
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
else
a
black
dog
ile
worth
no
more
nor
a
white
one
and
all
this
time
small
was
smelling
of
the
uncorked
bottle
taking
a
little
on
his
finger
and
feeling
of
it
and
thus
feeling
his
way
to
the
heart
drier
than
her
herbs
of
the
old
witch
and
then
he
went
round
the
cabin
gravely
lifting
each
separate
bunch
of
dried
yarbs
from
its
nail
smelling
of
it
and
then
by
making
an
of
his
silent
face
he
managed
to
get
a
lecture
from
her
on
each
article
in
her
with
the
most
marvelous
stories
illustrative
of
their
virtues
when
the
granny
had
got
her
fill
of
his
silent
flattery
he
was
ready
to
carry
forward
his
main
purpose
there
was
something
weird
about
this
silent
man
ability
to
turn
the
conversation
as
he
chose
to
have
it
go
sitting
by
the
nibbling
while
he
drank
his
glass
of
water
having
declined
even
her
sassafras
he
ceased
to
stimulate
her
medical
talk
and
opened
the
vein
of
gossip
once
started
granny
sanders
was
sure
to
allude
to
the
robbery
and
once
on
the
robbery
the
doctor
course
was
clear
i
somebody
not
fur
away
is
in
this
business
not
by
a
word
nor
even
by
a
nod
but
by
some
motion
of
the
eyelids
perhaps
small
indicated
that
he
agreed
with
her
who
d
is
but
small
was
not
in
the
habit
of
supposing
he
moved
his
head
in
a
quiet
way
just
the
least
perceptible
bit
but
so
that
the
old
creature
understood
that
he
could
give
light
if
he
wanted
to
i
dunno
anybody
that
been
here
long
as
could
be
suspected
another
motion
of
the
eyelids
indicated
small
agreement
with
this
remark
they
nobody
come
in
here
lately
the
master
small
looked
vacantly
at
the
wall
but
i
low
he
allers
bore
a
character
the
doctor
was
too
busy
looking
at
his
to
answer
this
remark
even
by
a
look
but
i
think
these
oversmart
young
men
bear
looking
arter
do
small
raised
his
eyes
and
let
them
an
assent
that
was
all
should
wonder
ef
our
master
was
overly
fond
of
gals
doctor
looks
down
at
his
plate
had
plenty
of
sweethearts
afore
he
walked
home
with
hanner
thomson
night
i
bet
did
small
shrug
his
shoulder
granny
thought
she
detected
a
faint
motion
of
the
sort
but
she
could
not
be
sure
and
i
think
as
how
that
a
feller
what
trifles
with
gals
hearts
and
then
runs
off
ten
miles
maybe
no
he
had
orter
be
what
i
says
says
i
to
this
general
remark
small
assented
in
his
invisible
shall
i
say
way
i
allers
think
maybe
that
some
folks
has
found
it
best
to
leave
home
and
go
away
you
ca
never
tell
but
when
people
is
robbed
it
well
to
lookout
hey
i
think
so
said
small
quietly
and
having
taken
his
hat
and
bowed
a
solemn
and
respectful
adieu
he
departed
he
had
not
spoken
twenty
words
but
he
had
satisfied
the
of
flat
creek
that
ralph
was
a
bad
character
at
home
and
worthy
of
suspicion
of
burglary

xi
miss
martha
hawkins
it
very
good
for
the
health
to
dig
in
the
elements
i
was
quite
emaciated
last
year
at
the
east
and
the
doctor
told
me
to
dig
in
the
elements
i
got
me
a
florial
hoe
and
dug
and
it
been
most
excellent
for
me
time
the
saturday
following
the
friday
on
which
ralph
kept
shocky
company
as
far
as
the
forks
near
granny
sanders
house
scene
the
squire
garden
ralph
helping
that
worthy
magistrate
perform
sundry
little
jobs
such
as
a
warm
winter
day
suggests
to
the
farmer
miss
martha
hawkins
the
squire
niece
and
his
housekeeper
in
his
present
bereaved
condition
leaning
over
the
palings
pickets
she
called
them
of
the
garden
fence
talking
to
the
master
miss
hawkins
was
recently
from
massachusetts
how
many
people
there
are
in
the
most
cultivated
communities
whose
education
is
partial
it
very
common
for
to
dig
in
the
elements
at
the
east
proceeded
miss
martha
like
many
other
people
born
in
the
celestial
empires
of
which
there
are
three
china
virginia
massachusetts
miss
martha
was
not
averse
to
reminding
outside
barbarians
of
her
good
fortune
in
this
regard
it
did
her
good
to
speak
of
the
east
now
ralph
was
amused
with
miss
martha
she
really
had
a
good
deal
of
intelligence
despite
her
affectation
and
conversation
with
her
was
both
interesting
and
diverting
it
helped
him
to
forget
hannah
and
bud
and
the
robbery
and
all
the
rest
and
she
was
so
delighted
to
find
somebody
to
make
an
impression
on
that
she
had
come
out
to
talk
while
ralph
was
at
work
but
just
at
this
moment
the
was
not
so
much
interested
in
her
interesting
remarks
nor
so
much
amused
by
her
amusing
remarks
as
he
should
have
been
he
saw
a
man
coming
down
the
road
riding
one
horse
and
leading
another
and
he
recognized
the
horses
at
a
distance
it
must
be
bud
who
was
riding
means
bay
mare
and
leading
bud
roan
colt
bud
had
been
to
mill
and
as
the
man
who
owned
the
kept
but
one
old
blind
horse
himself
it
was
necessary
that
bud
should
take
two
it
required
three
horses
to
run
the
mill
the
old
blind
one
could
have
ground
the
grist
but
the
two
others
had
to
overcome
the
friction
of
the
clumsy
machine
but
it
was
not
about
the
that
ralph
was
thinking
nor
about
the
two
horses
since
that
wednesday
evening
on
which
he
escorted
hannah
home
from
the
he
had
not
seen
bud
means
if
he
had
any
lingering
doubts
of
the
truth
of
what
mirandy
had
said
they
had
been
dissipated
by
the
absence
of
bud
from
school
when
i
was
to
bosting
miss
martha
was
boston
only
once
in
her
life
but
as
her
visit
to
that
sacred
city
was
the
most
important
occurrence
of
her
life
she
did
not
hesitate
to
air
her
reminiscences
of
it
frequently
when
i
was
to
bosting
she
was
just
saying
when
following
the
indication
of
ralph
eyes
she
saw
bud
coming
up
the
hill
near
squire
hawkins
house
bud
looked
red
and
sulky
and
to
and
miss
martha
hawkins
polite
recognitions
he
returned
only
a
surly
nod
they
both
saw
that
he
was
angry
ralph
was
able
to
guess
the
meaning
of
his
wrath
toward
evening
ralph
strolled
through
the
squire
cornfield
toward
the
woods
the
memory
of
the
walk
with
hannah
was
heavy
upon
the
heart
of
the
young
master
and
there
was
comfort
in
the
very
miserableness
of
the
cornstalks
with
their
disheveled
blades
hanging
like
tattered
banners
and
rattling
discordantly
in
the
rising
wind
wandering
without
purpose
ralph
followed
the
rows
of
stalks
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
in
a
zigzag
line
turning
a
right
angle
every
minute
or
two
at
last
he
came
out
in
a
woods
mostly
of
beech
and
he
pleased
his
melancholy
fancy
by
kicking
the
dry
and
silky
leaves
before
him
in
billows
while
the
soughing
of
the
wind
through
the
long
vibrant
boughs
and
slender
twigs
of
the
beech
forest
seemed
to
put
the
world
into
the
wailing
minor
key
of
his
own
despair
what
a
fascination
there
is
in
a
path
come
upon
suddenly
without
a
knowledge
of
its
termination
here
was
one
running
in
easy
irregular
curves
through
the
wood
now
turning
gently
to
the
right
in
order
to
avoid
a
stump
now
swaying
suddenly
to
the
left
to
gain
an
easier
descent
at
a
steep
place
and
now
turning
wantonly
to
the
one
side
or
the
other
as
if
from
very
caprice
in
the
man
who
by
idle
steps
unconsciously
marked
the
line
of
the
at
first
ralph
could
not
resist
the
impulse
who
could
to
follow
the
path
and
find
out
its
destination
and
following
it
he
came
presently
into
a
lonesome
hollow
where
a
brook
gurgled
among
the
heaps
of
bare
limestone
rocks
that
filled
its
bed
following
the
path
still
he
came
upon
a
queer
little
cabin
built
of
round
logs
in
the
midst
of
a
small
inclosed
by
a
brush
fence
the
stick
chimney
daubed
with
clay
and
topped
with
a
barrel
open
at
both
ends
made
this
a
typical
cabin
illustration
captain
pearson
it
flashed
upon
ralph
that
this
place
must
be
rocky
hollow
and
that
this
was
the
house
of
old
john
pearson
the
and
his
rheumatic
wife
the
house
that
hospitably
sheltered
shocky
following
his
impulse
he
knocked
and
was
admitted
and
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
miss
martha
hawkins
there
before
him
you
here
miss
hawkins
he
said
when
he
had
returned
shocky
greeting
and
shaken
hands
with
the
old
couple
bless
you
yes
said
the
old
lady
that
blessed
gyirl
the
old
lady
called
her
a
girl
by
a
sort
of
figure
of
speech
perhaps
that
blessed
gyirl
the
kindest
creetur
you
ever
saw
comes
here
every
day
most
to
cheer
a
body
up
with
somethin
or
nuther
miss
martha
blushed
and
said
she
came
because
rocky
hollow
looked
so
much
like
a
place
she
used
to
know
at
the
east
and
pearson
were
the
kindest
people
they
reminded
her
of
people
she
knew
at
the
east
when
she
was
to
bosting
here
the
old
lifted
his
head
from
his
work
and
said
pshaw
that
talk
about
kyindness
he
was
a
kentuckian
and
said
is
all
humbug
i
wonder
so
smart
a
woman

every
night
for
two
weeks
said
shocky
as
he
handed
the
old
man
a
splint
yes
i
was
too
this
in
a
tone
that
made
ralph
tremble
your
father
was
a
miserable
britisher
i

the
war
of
and
lost
my
leg
by
one
of
stickin
his
bagonet
right
through

that
night
at

but
my

a
satisfaction
to

britisher
but
ef

and
to

shipped
this
was
turned
upside
down
over
the
inebriate
and
loaded
with
logs
or
any
other
heavy
articles
that
would
make
escape
difficult
when
the
poor
wretch
should
come
to
himself
it
was
a
sort
of
rude
punishment
for
inebriety
and
it
afforded
a
delight
to
those
who
executed
justice
chapter

the
hardshell
preacher
they
preachin
down
to
bethel
said
the
squire
at
breakfast
twenty
years
in
the
west
could
not
cure
squire
hawkins
of
saying
to
for
at
i
rather
guess
as
how
the
old
man
bosaw
will
give
pertickeler
fits
to
our
folks
for
squire
hawkins
having
been
expelled
from
the
hardshell
church
of
which
bosaw
was
pastor
for
the
grave
offense
of
joining
a
temperance
society
had
become
a
member
of
the
reformers
the
very
respectable
people
who
now
call
themselves
disciples
but
whom
the
profane
will
persist
in
calling
campbellites
they
had
a
church
in
the
village
of
clifty
three
miles
away
i
know
that
explanations
are
always
abominable
to
story
readers
as
they
are
to
story
writers
but
as
so
many
of
my
readers
have
never
had
the
inestimable
privilege
of
sitting
under
the
gospel
as
it
is
ministered
in
enlightened
neighborhoods
like
flat
creek
i
find
myself
under
the
necessity
the
rev
bosaw
would
call
it
of
rising
to
explain
some
people
think
the
hardshells
a
myth
and
some
sensitive
baptist
people
at
the
east
resent
all
allusion
to
them
but
the
hardshell
baptists
or
as
they
are
otherwise
called
the
whisky
baptists
and
the
baptists
exist
in
all
the
old
western
and
states
they
call
themselves
baptists
from
their
antinomian
tenets
their
confession
of
faith
is
a
caricature
of
calvinism
and
is
expressed
by
their
preachers
about
as
follows
ef
you
elected
you
be
saved
ef
you
you
be
damned
take
keer
of
his
elect
it
a
sin
to
run
or
or
to
send
missionaries
you
let
god
business
alone
what
is
to
be
will
be
and
you
ca
hender
it
this
writer
has
attended
a
the
superintendent
of
which
was
solemnly
arraigned
and
expelled
from
the
hardshell
church
for
meddling
with
god
business
by
holding
a
of
course
the
hardshells
are
prodigiously
illiterate
and
often
vicious
some
of
their
preachers
are
notorious
drunkards
they
sing
their
sermons
out
sometimes
for
three
hours
at
a
stretch
ralph
found
that
he
was
to
ride
the
mare
the
only
one
of
the
horses
that
would
carry
double
and
that
consequently
he
would
have
to
take
miss
hawkins
behind
him
if
it
had
been
hannah
instead
ralph
might
not
have
objected
to
this
young
lochinvar
mode
of
riding
with
a
lady
on
the
croup
but
martha
hawkins
was
another
affair
he
had
only
this
consolation
his
keeping
the
company
of
miss
hawkins
might
serve
to
disarm
the
resentment
of
bud
at
all
events
he
had
no
choice
what
designs
the
squire
had
in
this
arrangement
he
could
not
tell
but
the
mare
carried
him
to
meeting
on
that
december
morning
with
martha
hawkins
behind
and
as
miss
hawkins
was
not
used
to
this
mode
of
locomotion
she
was
in
a
state
of
delightful
fright
every
time
the
horse
sank
to
the
knees
in
the
soft
yellow
flat
creek
clay
we
do
go
to
church
so
at
the
east
she
said
the
mud
is
so
deep
at
the
east
when
i
was
to
bosting
but
ralph
never
heard
what
happened
when
she
was
to
bosting
for
just
as
she
said
bosting
the
mare
put
her
foot
into
a
deep
hole
molded
by
the
foot
of
the
squire
horse
and
already
full
of
muddy
water
as
the
mare
foot
went
twelve
inches
down
into
this
track
the
muddy
water
spurted
higher
than
miss
hawkins
head
and
mottled
her
dress
with
golden
spots
of
clay
she
gave
a
little
shriek
and
declared
that
she
had
never
seen
it
so
at
the
east
the
journey
seemed
a
little
long
to
ralph
who
found
that
the
subjects
upon
which
he
and
miss
hawkins
could
converse
were
few
but
miss
martha
was
determined
to
keep
things
going
and
once
when
the
conversation
had
died
out
entirely
she
made
a
desperate
effort
to
renew
it
by
remarking
as
they
met
a
man
on
horseback
that
horse
switches
his
tail
just
as
they
do
at
the
east
when
i
was
to
bosting
i
saw
horses
switch
their
tails
just
that
way
what
surprised
ralph
was
to
see
that
flat
creek
went
to
meeting
everybody
was
there
the
meanses
the
joneses
the
bantas
and
all
the
rest
everybody
on
flat
creek
seemed
to
be
there
except
the
old
his
family
was
represented
by
shocky
who
had
come
doubtless
to
get
a
glimpse
of
hannah
not
to
hear
bosaw
preach
in
fact
few
were
thinking
of
the
religious
service
they
went
to
church
as
a
common
resort
to
hear
the
news
and
to
find
out
what
was
the
current
sensation
on
this
particular
morning
there
seemed
to
be
some
unusual
excitement
ralph
perceived
it
as
he
rode
up
an
excited
crowd
even
though
it
be
at
a
on
sunday
morning
can
not
conceal
its
agitation
ralph
deposited
miss
hawkins
on
the
stile
and
then
got
down
himself
and
paid
her
the
closest
attention
to
the
door
this
attention
was
for
benefit
but
bud
only
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
scowling
worse
than
ever
ralph
did
not
go
in
at
the
door
it
was
not
the
flat
creek
custom
the
men
gossiped
outside
while
the
women
chatted
within
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
of
the
excitement
ralph
could
not
get
at
it
when
he
entered
a
little
knot
of
people
they
became
embarrassed
the
group
dissolved
and
its
component
parts
joined
other
companies
what
had
the
current
of
conversation
to
do
with
him
he
overheard
pete
jones
saying
that
the
blamed
old
wooden
leg
was
in
it
anyhow
he
been
seen
goin
home
at
two
in
the
mornin
and
he
could
name
somebody
else
ef
he
choosed
but
it
was
best
to
clean
out
one
at
a
time
and
just
then
there
was
a
murmur
meetin
took
up
and
the
masculine
element
filled
the
empty
half
of
the
church
when
ralph
saw
hannah
looking
utterly
dejected
his
heart
smote
him
and
the
great
struggle
set
in
again
had
it
not
been
for
the
thought
of
the
other
battle
and
the
comforting
presence
of
the
helper
i
fear
interests
would
have
fared
badly
but
ralph
with
the
spirit
of
a
martyr
resolved
to
wait
until
he
knew
what
the
result
of
bud
suit
should
be
and
whether
indeed
the
young
goliath
had
prior
claims
as
he
evidently
thought
he
had
he
turned
hopefully
to
the
sermon
determined
to
pick
up
any
crumbs
of
comfort
that
might
fall
from
bosaw
meager
table
in
reporting
a
single
specimen
passage
of
bosaw
sermon
i
shall
not
take
the
liberty
which
thucydides
and
other
ancient
historians
did
of
making
the
sermon
and
putting
it
into
the
hero
mouth
but
shall
give
that
which
can
be
vouched
for
you
see
my
respective
hearers
he
began
but
alas
i
can
never
picture
to
you
the
rich
red
nose
the
see
sawing
gestures
the
nasal
resonance
the
sniffle
the
melancholy
minor
key
and
all
that
my
respective
you
as
as
my
says
that
the
knoweth
his
the
his
master
now
my
respective
they
a
mighty
sight
of
atwext
and
ralph
could
not
help
reflecting
that
there
was
a
mighty
sight
of
resemblance
between
some
men
and
asses
but
the
preacher
did
not
see
this
analogy
it
lay
too
close
to
him
you
see
is
mighty
like
fer
a
tremengious
atwixt
defferent
jest
as
thar
is
atwext
defferent
fer
the
ox
his
and
the
his
master
now
my
respective
the
preacher
voice
here
grew
mellow
and
the
succeeding
sentences
were
in
the
most
pathetic
and
lugubrious
tones
you
all
that
your
humble
has
jest
the
best
yoke
of
in
this
here
betsey
short
shook
the
floor
with
a
suppressed
titter
they
no
sech
steers
as
them
air
two
of
in
this
whole
them
crack
oxen
over
at
a
to
fer
the
ox
knoweth
his
and
the
his
now
my
respective
they
a
right
smart
sight
of
atwext
them
air
two
jest
like
they
is
atwext
defferent
here
the
speaker
grew
earnest
and
sawed
the
air
from
this
to
the
close
in
a
most
frightful
way
you
when
i
go
in
the
to
them
air
and
i
wo
why
jest
stands
stock
and
do
hardly
while
i
put
on

and
put
in

and
put
in
the
fer
my
and
the
ox
knoweth
his
and
the
his
master

when
i
stand
at
eend
of
the
and
say
come
come
why
what
do
you
that
ornery
ole
of
comin
right
and
puttin
his
neck
acts
jest
like
some
what
is
jest
kinder
sorter
stands
and
kinder
sorter
puts
his
head
this
and
kinder
looks
and
says
alas
hartsook
found
no
spiritual
edification
there
and
he
was
in
no
mood
to
be
amused
and
so
while
the
sermon
drew
on
through
two
dreary
hours
he
forgot
the
preacher
in
noticing
a
bright
green
lizard
which
having
taken
up
its
winter
quarters
behind
the
tin
candlestick
that
hung
just
back
of
the
preacher
head
had
been
deceived
by
the
genial
warmth
coming
from
the
great
and
now
ran
out
two
or
three
feet
from
his
shelter
looking
down
upon
the
preacher
in
a
most
confidential
and
amusing
manner
sometimes
he
would
retreat
behind
the
candlestick
which
was
not
twelve
inches
from
the
preacher
head
and
then
rush
out
again
at
each
reappearance
betsey
short
would
stuff
her
handkerchief
into
her
mouth
and
shake
in
a
most
distressing
way
shocky
wondered
what
the
lizard
was
winking
at
the
preacher
about
and
miss
martha
thought
that
it
reminded
her
of
a
lizard
that
she
see
at
the
east
the
time
she
was
to
bosting
in
a
jar
of
alcohol
in
the
natural
history
rooms
the
squire
was
not
disappointed
in
his
anticipation
that
bosaw
would
attack
his
denomination
with
some
fury
in
fact
the
old
preacher
outdid
himself
in
his
violent
indignation
at
these
people
that
follow
that
that
will
save
and
that
to
and
and
them
air
that
not
ortherized
in
the
but
comes
of
the
and
takes
folks
as
belongs
to
to
as
they
came
out
the
door
ralph
rallied
enough
to
remark
he
did
attack
your
people
squire
oh
yes
said
the
squire
did
you
see
the
sarpent
inspirin
him
but
the
long
long
hours
were
ended
and
ralph
got
on
the
mare
and
rode
up
alongside
the
stile
whence
miss
martha
mounted
and
as
he
went
away
with
a
heavy
heart
he
overheard
pete
jones
call
out
to
somebody
we
tend
to
his
case
christmas
christmas
was
two
days
off
and
miss
martha
remarked
with
much
trepidation
that
poor
pearson
would
have
to
leave
she
always
been
afraid
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
it
reminded
her
of
something
she
heard
at
the
east
the
time
she
was
down
to
bosting
footnotes
footnote
even
the
baptists
have
suffered
from
the
dire
spirit
of
the
age
they
are
a
very
respectable
body
of
people
calling
themselves
primitive
baptists
perhaps
the
description
in
the
text
never
applied
to
the
whole
denomination
but
only
to
the
hardshells
of
certain
localities
some
of
these
intensely
conservative
churches
i
have
reason
to
believe
were
always
composed
of
reputable
people
but
what
is
said
above
is
not
in
the
least
exaggerated
as
a
description
of
many
of
the
churches
in
indiana
and
illinois
their
opposition
to
the
temperance
reformation
was
both
theoretical
and
practical
a
rather
able
minister
of
the
denomination
whom
i
knew
as
a
boy
used
to
lie
in
besotted
drunkenness
by
the
roadside
i
am
sorry
to
confess
that
he
once
represented
the
county
in
the
state
legislature
the
piece
of
a
sermon
given
in
this
chapter
was
heard
near
cairo
illinois
in
the
days
before
the
war
most
of
the
preachers
were
illiterate
farmers
i
have
heard
one
of
them
hold
forth
two
hours
at
a
stretch
but
even
in
that
day
there
were
men
among
the
hardshells
whose
ability
and
character
commanded
respect
this
was
true
especially
in
kentucky
where
able
men
like
the
two
dudleys
held
to
the
antinomian
wing
of
their
denomination
but
the
hardshells
are
perceptibly
less
hard
than
they
were
you
may
march
at
the
rear
of
the
column
among
hunkers
and
hardshells
if
you
will
but
you
are
obliged
to
march
those
who
will
not
go
voluntarily

chapter
xiii
a
struggle
for
the
mastery
the
school
had
closed
on
monday
evening
as
usual
the
boys
had
been
talking
in
knots
all
day
nothing
but
the
bulldog
in
the
slender
resolute
young
master
had
kept
down
the
rising
storm
a
teacher
who
has
lost
moral
support
at
home
can
not
long
govern
a
school
ralph
had
effectually
lost
his
popularity
in
the
district
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
could
not
divine
from
just
what
quarter
the
ill
wind
came
except
that
he
felt
sure
of
small
agency
in
it
somewhere
even
hannah
had
slighted
him
when
he
called
at
means
on
monday
morning
to
draw
the
pittance
of
pay
that
was
due
him
he
had
expected
a
petition
for
a
holiday
on
christmas
day
such
holidays
are
deducted
from
the
teacher
time
and
it
is
customary
for
the
boys
to
turn
out
the
teacher
who
refuses
to
grant
them
by
barring
him
out
of
the
on
christmas
and
new
year
morning
ralph
had
intended
to
grant
a
holiday
if
it
should
be
asked
but
it
was
not
asked
hank
banta
was
the
ringleader
in
the
disaffection
and
he
had
managed
to
draw
the
surly
bud
who
was
present
this
morning
into
it
it
is
but
fair
to
say
that
bud
was
in
favor
of
making
a
request
before
resorting
to
extreme
measures
but
he
was
overruled
he
gave
it
as
his
solemn
opinion
that
the
master
was
mighty
peart
and
they
would
be
beat
anyhow
some
way
but
he
would
lick
the
master
fer
two
cents
ef
he
so
slim
that
he
feel
like
he
was
fighting
a
baby
and
all
that
day
things
looked
black
ralph
countenance
was
cold
and
hard
as
stone
and
shocky
trembled
where
he
sat
betsey
short
tittered
rather
more
than
usual
a
riot
or
a
murder
would
have
seemed
amusing
to
her
school
was
dismissed
and
ralph
instead
of
returning
to
the
squire
set
out
for
the
village
of
clifty
a
few
miles
away
no
one
knew
what
he
went
for
and
some
suggested
that
he
had
sloped
but
bud
said
he
war
that
air
kind
he
was
one
of
them
air
sort
as
died
in
their
tracks
was
hartsook
they
find
him
on
the
ground
nex
morning
and
he
lowed
the
master
war
made
of
that
air
sort
of
stuff
as
would
burn
the
ole
to
ashes
or
blow
it
into
splinters
but
what
he
beat
howsumdever
he
said
he
was
to
help
and
help
he
would
but
all
the
sinno
in
golier
would
be
no
account
again
the
cute
they
was
in
the
head
of
the
master
but
bud
discouraged
as
he
was
with
the
fear
of
ralph
cute
went
like
a
martyr
to
the
stake
and
took
his
place
with
the
rest
in
the
at
nine
at
night
it
may
have
been
intention
to
preoccupy
the
for
at
ten
hank
banta
was
set
shaking
from
head
to
foot
at
seeing
a
face
that
looked
like
the
master
at
the
window
he
waked
up
bud
and
told
him
about
it
well
what
are
you
about
you
coward
growled
bud
he
wo
shoot
you
but
he
beat
you
at
this
game
i
bet
a
hoss
and
me
too
and
make
us
both
as
of
ourselves
as
dogs
with
to
their
tails
you
do
know
the
master
though
he
did
duck
you
but
he
larn
you
a
good
lesson
this
time
and
me
too
like
as
not
and
bud
soon
snored
again
but
hank
shook
with
fear
every
time
he
looked
at
the
blackness
outside
the
windows
he
was
sure
he
heard
he
would
have
given
anything
to
have
been
at
home
when
morning
came
the
pupils
began
to
gather
early
a
few
boys
who
were
likely
to
prove
of
service
in
the
coming
siege
were
admitted
through
the
window
and
then
everything
was
made
fast
and
a
snack
was
eaten
how
do
you
he
get
in
said
hank
trying
to
hide
his
fear
how
do
i
said
bud
i
do
nothin
about
it
you
might
as
well
ax
me
where
i
the
nex
shootin
star
is
to
drap
hartsook
mighty
onsartin
but
he
git
in
though
and
tan
your
hide
fer
you
you
see
ef
he
do
he
do
blow
up
the
with
gunpowder
this
last
was
thrown
in
by
way
of
alleviating
the
fears
of
the
cowardly
hank
for
whom
bud
had
a
great
contempt
the
time
for
school
had
almost
come
the
boys
inside
were
demoralized
by
waiting
they
began
to
hope
that
the
master
had
sloped
they
dreaded
to
see
him
coming
i
do
believe
he
come
said
hank
with
a
cold
shiver
it
past
yes
he
will
come
too
said
bud
and
he
to
come
in
here
mighty
quick
i
do
know
how
but
he
be
at
that
air
desk
when
it
nine
i
bet
a
thousand
dollars
on
that
he
take
it
into
his
head
to
blow
us
up
hank
was
now
white
some
of
the
parents
came
along
accidentally
of
course
and
stopped
to
see
the
fun
sure
that
bud
would
thrash
the
master
if
he
tried
to
break
in
small
on
the
way
to
see
a
patient
perhaps
reined
up
in
front
of
the
door
still
no
ralph
it
was
just
five
minutes
before
nine
a
rumor
now
gained
currency
that
he
had
been
seen
going
to
clifty
the
evening
before
and
that
he
had
not
come
back
though
in
fact
ralph
had
come
back
and
had
slept
at
squire
hawkins
there
the
master
cried
betsey
short
who
stood
out
in
the
road
shivering
and
giggling
alternately
for
ralph
at
that
moment
emerged
from
the
by
the
carrying
a
board
ho
ho
laughed
hank
he
thinks
he
smoke
us
out
i
guess
find
us
ready
the
boys
had
let
the
fire
burn
down
and
there
was
now
nothing
but
hot
hickory
coals
on
the
hearth
i
tell
you
he
come
in
he
did
go
to
clifty
fer
nothing
said
bud
who
sat
still
on
one
of
the
benches
which
leaned
against
the
door
i
do
know
how
but
they
lots
of
ways
of
killing
a
cat
besides
her
with
butter
he
come
in
he
do
blow
us
all
ralph
voice
was
now
heard
demanding
that
the
door
be
opened
let
open
her
said
hank
turning
livid
with
fear
at
the
firm
confident
tone
of
the
master
bud
straightened
himself
up
hank
you
a
coward
i
got
a
mind
to
kick
you
you
got
me
into
this
blamed
mess
and
now
you
want
to
you
jest
tech
one
of
these
fastenings
and
i
lay
you
out
flat
of
your
back
afore
you
can
say
jack
robinson
the
teacher
was
climbing
to
the
roof
with
the
board
in
hand
that
air
wo
win
laughed
pete
jones
outside
he
saw
that
there
was
no
smoke
even
bud
began
to
hope
that
ralph
would
fail
for
once
the
master
was
now
on
the
of
the
he
took
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
deliberately
poured
the
contents
down
the
chimney
pete
jones
shouted
gunpowder
and
set
off
down
the
road
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
explosion
small
remembered
probably
that
his
patient
might
die
while
he
sat
here
and
started
on
but
ralph
emptied
the
paper
and
laid
the
board
over
the
chimney
what
a
row
there
was
inside
the
benches
that
were
braced
against
the
door
were
thrown
down
and
hank
banta
rushed
out
rubbing
his
eyes
coughing
frantically
and
sure
that
he
had
been
blown
up
all
the
rest
followed
bud
bringing
up
the
rear
sulkily
but
coughing
and
sneezing
for
dear
life
such
a
smell
of
sulphur
as
came
from
that
betsey
had
to
lean
against
the
fence
to
giggle
illustration
fire
and
brimstone
as
soon
as
all
were
out
ralph
threw
the
board
off
the
chimney
leaped
to
the
ground
entered
the
and
opened
the
windows
the
school
soon
followed
him
and
all
was
still
would
he
thrash
this
was
the
important
question
in
hank
banta
mind
and
the
rest
looked
for
a
battle
with
bud
it
is
just
nine
said
ralph
consulting
his
watch
and
glad
to
see
you
all
here
promptly
i
should
have
given
you
a
holiday
if
you
had
asked
me
like
gentlemen
yesterday
on
the
whole
i
think
i
shall
give
you
a
holiday
anyhow
the
school
is
dismissed
and
hank
felt
foolish
and
bud
secretly
resolved
to
thrash
hank
or
the
master
he
did
care
which
and
mirandy
looked
the
love
she
could
not
utter
and
betsey
giggled
chapter
xiv
a
crisis
with
bud
ralph
sat
still
at
his
desk
the
school
had
gone
all
at
once
he
became
conscious
that
shocky
sat
yet
in
his
accustomed
place
upon
the
hard
backless
bench
why
shocky
have
you
gone
yet
no
sir
i
was
waitin
to
see
if
you
war
too
i
well
i
thought
it
would
make
me
feel
as
if
god
war
quite
so
fur
away
to
talk
to
you
it
did
the
other
day
the
master
rose
and
put
his
hand
on
shocky
head
was
it
the
brotherhood
in
affliction
that
made
shocky
words
choke
him
so
or
was
it
the
weird
thoughts
that
he
expressed
or
was
it
the
recollection
that
shocky
was
hannah
brother
hannah
so
far
far
away
from
him
now
at
any
rate
shocky
looking
up
for
the
smile
on
which
he
fed
saw
the
relaxing
of
the
master
face
that
had
been
as
hard
as
stone
and
felt
just
one
hot
tear
on
his
hand
god
forgot
you
too
said
shocky
in
a
sort
of
half
soliloquy
better
get
away
from
flat
creek
you
see
god
forgets
everybody
down
here
everybody
forgets
god
bosaw
and
i
god
do
no
ways
keer
to
be
remembered
by
sich
as
him
leastways
i
would
if
i
was
god
you
know
i
wonder
what
becomes
of
folks
when
god
forgets
and
shocky
seeing
that
the
master
had
resumed
his
seat
and
was
looking
absently
into
the
fire
moved
slowly
out
the
door
shocky
called
the
master
the
little
poet
came
back
and
stood
before
him
shocky
you
must
think
god
has
forgotten
you
god
brings
things
out
right
at
last
but
ralph
own
faith
was
weak
and
his
words
sounded
hollow
and
hypocritical
to
himself
would
god
indeed
bring
things
out
right
he
sat
musing
a
good
while
trying
to
convince
himself
of
the
truth
of
what
he
had
just
been
saying
to
shocky
that
god
would
indeed
bring
things
out
right
at
last
would
it
all
come
out
right
if
bud
married
hannah
would
it
all
come
out
right
if
he
were
driven
from
flat
creek
with
a
dark
suspicion
upon
his
character
did
god
concern
himself
with
these
things
was
there
any
god
it
was
the
same
old
struggle
between
doubt
and
faith
and
when
ralph
looked
up
shocky
had
departed
in
the
next
hour
ralph
fought
the
old
battle
of
armageddon
i
shall
not
describe
it
you
will
fight
it
in
your
own
way
no
two
alike
the
important
thing
is
the
end
if
you
come
out
as
he
did
with
the
doubt
gone
and
the
trust
in
god
victorious
it
matters
little
just
what
shape
the
battle
may
take
since
jacob
became
israel
there
have
never
been
two
such
struggles
alike
save
in
that
they
all
end
either
in
victory
or
in
defeat
it
was
after
twelve
on
that
christmas
day
when
ralph
put
his
head
out
the
door
of
the
and
called
out
bud
i
like
to
see
you
bud
did
not
care
to
see
the
master
for
he
had
inly
resolved
to
thrash
him
and
have
done
with
him
but
he
could
back
out
certainly
not
in
sight
of
the
others
who
were
passing
along
the
road
with
him
i
do
want
the
rest
of
you
said
ralph
in
a
decided
way
as
he
saw
that
hank
and
one
or
two
others
were
resolved
to
come
also
thought
maybe
you
want
somebody
to
see
far
play
said
hank
as
he
went
off
sheepishly
if
i
did
you
would
be
the
last
one
i
should
ask
said
ralph
no
unfair
play
in
bud
and
there
is
in
you
and
he
shut
the
door
now
looky
here
ralph
hartsook
said
bud
you
do
come
no
gum
games
over
me
with
your
saft
sodder
and
all
that
i
made
up
my
mind
you
got
to
promise
to
leave
these
digging
or
i
got
to
thrash
you
you
have
to
thrash
me
then
said
ralph
turning
a
little
pale
but
remembering
the
bulldog
but
you
tell
me
what
it
all
about
you
you
know
well
enough
folks
says
you
know
more
the
robbery
at
the
dutchman
than
you
orter
but
i
do
believe
them
fer
them
as
says
it
is
liars
and
thieves
theirselves
fer
none
of
that
and
i
tell
you
what
it
fer
so
now
if
you
wo
travel
why
take
off
your
coat
and
git
ready
fer
a
thrashing
the
master
took
off
his
coat
and
showed
his
slender
arms
bud
laid
his
off
and
showed
the
physique
of
a
you
to
fight
said
bud
not
unless
you
make
me
why
i
could
chaw
you
all
up
i
know
that
well
you
the
grittiest
feller
i
ever
did
see
and
ef
you
jest
kep
off
of
my
ground
i
would
a
touched
you
but
i
to
be
cut
out
by
no
feller
a
livin
thrashin
him
in
an
inch
of
his
life
you
see
i
wanted
to
git
out
of
this
flat
crick
way
we
a
set
here
in
flat
crick
and
i
says
to
myself
i
try
to

other
triflin
ones

with
yor
and
town
manners
but
start
right
out
to
git
away
the
gal
that
i
picked
out
when
i
picked
her
out
kase

thought

flat
crick
born

might
help
a
feller
to
do
better
now
i
wo
let
nobody
cut
me

tried
to
cut
you
out
you
ca
fool
bud
listen
to
me
and
then
thrash
me
if
you
will
i
went
with
that
girl
once
when
i
found
you
had
some
claims
i
gave
her
up
not
because
i
was
afraid
of
you
for
i
would
rather
have
taken
the
worst
thrashing
you
can
give
me
than
give
her
up
but
i
have
spoken
to
her
since
the
night
of
the
first
you
lie
said
bud
doubling
his
fists
ralph
grew
red
you
was
on
her
last
sunday
right
afore
my
eyes
and
to
ketch
my
attention
too
so
when
you
ready
say
so
bud
there
is
some
misunderstanding
hartsook
spoke
slowly
and
felt
bewildered
i
tell
you
that
i
did
not
speak
to
hannah
last
sunday
and
you
know
i
did
hanner
bud
eyes
grew
large
hanner
here
he
gasped
for
breath
and
looked
around
hanner
he
could
get
any
further
than
the
name
at
first
why
plague
take
it
who
said
hanner
mirandy
said
you
were
courting
hannah
said
ralph
feeling
round
in
a
vague
way
to
get
his
ideas
together
mirandy
thunder
you
believed
mirandy
well
now
looky
here
hartsook
ef
you
was
to
say
that
my
sister
lied
i
lick
you
till
yer
hide
would
hold
shucks
but
say
you
and
me
and
the
do
you
never
believe
nothing
that
mirandy
means
says
her
and
marm
has
set
theirselves
like
fools
to
git
you
hanner
well
a
mighty
nice
gal
but
you
welcome
to
i
never
tuck
no
shine
that
air
way
but
i
was
out
of
school
last
thursday
and
friday
corn
to
take
to
mill
and
when
i
come
past
the
squire
and
seed
you
talking
to
a
gal
as
is
a
gal
you
know
here
bud
hesitated
and
looked
foolish
i
felt
hoppin
mad
bud
put
on
his
coat
ralph
put
on
his
coat
then
they
shook
hands
and
bud
went
out
ralph
sat
looking
into
the
fire
there
was
no
conscientious
difficulty
now
in
the
way
of
his
claiming
hannah
the
dry
forestick
lying
on
the
rude
stone
andirons
burst
into
a
blaze
the
smoldering
hope
in
the
heart
of
ralph
hartsook
did
the
same
he
could
have
hannah
if
he
could
win
her
but
there
came
slowly
back
the
recollection
of
his
lost
standing
in
flat
creek
there
was
circumstantial
evidence
against
him
it
was
evident
that
hannah
believed
something
of
this
what
other
stones
small
might
have
put
in
circulation
he
did
not
know
would
small
try
to
win
hannah
love
to
throw
it
away
again
as
he
had
done
with
others
at
least
he
would
not
spare
any
pains
to
turn
the
heart
of
the
bound
girl
against
ralph
the
bright
flame
on
the
forestick
which
ralph
had
been
watching
flickered
and
burned
low
chapter
xv
the
church
of
the
best
licks
just
as
the
flame
on
the
forestick
which
ralph
had
watched
so
intensely
flickered
and
burned
low
and
just
as
ralph
with
a
heavy
but
not
quite
hopeless
heart
rose
to
leave
the
latch
lifted
and
bud
i
wanted
to
say
something
he
stammered
but
you
know
it
hard
to
say
it
i
no
to
speak
of
and
some
things
is
hard
to
say
when
a
man
got
to
say
with
and
they
some
things
a
man
ca
hardly
ever
say
anyhow
to
anybody
here
bud
stopped
but
ralph
spoke
in
such
a
way
in
reply
that
he
felt
encouraged
to
go
on
you
gin
up
hanner
kase
you
thought
she
belonged
to
me
that
i
a
done
by
a
long
shot
now
arter
i
left
here
jest
now
i
says
to
myself
a
man
what
can
gin
up
his
gal
on
account
of
sech
a
feeling
fer
the
rights
of
a
flat
cricker
like
me
why
it
says
i
sech
a
man
is
the
man
as
can
help
me
do
better
i
do
know
whether
you
a
hardshell
or
a
saftshell
or
a
methodist
or
a
campbellite
or
a
new
light
or
a
united
brother
or
a
millerite
or
but
i
says
the
man
what
can
do
the
clean
thing
by
a
ugly
feller
like
me
and
stick
to
it
when
i
was
jest
ready
to
eat
him
up
is
a
kind
of
a
man
to
tie
to
here
bud
stopped
in
fright
at
his
own
volubility
for
he
had
run
his
words
off
like
a
piece
learned
by
heart
as
though
afraid
that
if
he
stopped
he
would
not
have
courage
to
go
on
ralph
said
that
he
did
not
belong
to
any
church
and
he
was
afraid
he
could
do
bud
much
good
but
his
tone
was
full
of
sympathy
and
what
is
better
than
sympathy
a
yearning
for
sympathy
you
see
said
bud
i
wanted
to
git
out
of
this
flat
crick
way
of
livin
we
a
hard
set
down
here
hartsook
and
i
to
be
one
of
the
hardest
of
but
i
never
could
git
no
good
out
of
bosaw
with
his
whisky
and
meanness
and
i
went
to
the
mount
tabor
church
concert
i
heard
a
man
discussin
baptism
and
regeneration
and
so
on
that
did
seem
no
cure
for
me
i
went
to
a
revival
over
at
clifty
well
no
use
first
night
they
was
a
man
that
spoke
about
jesus
christ
in
sech
a
way
that
i
wanted
to
foller
him
everywhere
but
i
did
feel
fit
next
night
i
come
back
with
my
mind
made
up
that
try
jesus
christ
and
see
ef
he
have
me
but
laws
they
was
a
big
man
that
night
that
preached
hell
not
that
i
do
believe
they
a
hell
they
plenty
not
a
thousand
miles
away
as
deserves
it
and
i
do
know
as
i
too
good
for
it
myself
but
he
pitched
it
at
us
and
stuck
it
in
our
faces
in
sech
a
way
that
i
got
mad
and
i
says
well
ef
god
sends
me
to
hell
he
ca
make
me
holler
nohow
you
see
my
dander
was
up
and
when
my
dander
up
i
would
gin
up
fer
the
devil
the
preacher
was
so
insultin
with
his
way
of
doin
it
he
seemed
to
be
kind
of
glad
that
we
was
to
be
damned
and
he
preached
somethin
like
some
folks
swears
it
did
sound
a
bit
like
the
christ
the
little
man
preached
about
the
night
afore
so
what
does
me
and
a
lot
of
fellers
do
but
slip
out
and
cut
off
the
big
preacher
stirrups
and
hang
on
to
the
rider
of
the
fence
and
then
set
his
hoss
loose
and
from
that
day
sometimes
i
did
and
sometimes
i
did
want
to
be
better
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
must
know
somethin
as
would
help
me
nothing
is
worse
than
a
religious
experience
kept
ready
to
be
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
everybody
whether
the
time
is
appropriate
or
not
but
never
was
a
religious
experience
more
appropriate
than
the
account
which
ralph
gave
to
bud
of
his
struggle
in
the
dark
the
confession
of
his
weakness
and
wicked
selfishness
was
a
great
comfort
to
bud
do
you
think
that
jesus
christ
would
would
well
do
you
think
help
a
poor
unlarnt
flat
cricker
like
me
i
think
he
was
a
sort
of
a
flat
creeker
himself
said
ralph
slowly
and
very
earnestly
you
do
say
said
bud
almost
getting
off
his
seat
why
you
see
the
town
he
lived
in
was
a
rough
place
it
was
called
nazareth
which
meant
you
do
say
and
he
was
called
a
nazarene
which
was
about
the
same
as
and
ralph
read
the
different
passages
which
he
had
studied
at
illustrating
the
condescension
of
jesus
the
stories
of
the
publicans
the
harlots
the
poor
who
came
to
him
and
he
read
about
nathanael
who
lived
only
six
miles
away
saying
any
good
thing
come
out
of
nazareth
jus
what
clifty
folks
says
about
flat
crick
broke
in
bud
do
you
think
i
could
begin
without
being
baptized
he
added
presently
why
not
let
begin
now
to
do
the
best
we
can
by
his
help
you
mean
then
that
i
to
begin
now
to
put
in
my
best
licks
for
jesus
christ
and
that
he
help
me
this
shocked
ralph
veneration
a
little
but
it
was
the
sincere
utterance
of
an
earnest
soul
it
may
not
have
been
an
orthodox
start
but
it
was
the
one
start
for
bud
and
there
be
those
who
have
repeated
with
the
finest
√¶sthetic
appreciation
the
old
english
liturgies
who
have
never
known
religious
aspiration
so
sincere
as
that
of
this
ignorant
young
hercules
whose
best
confession
was
that
he
meant
hereafter
to
put
in
his
best
licks
for
jesus
christ
and
there
be
those
who
can
define
repentance
and
faith
to
the
turning
of
a
hair
who
never
made
so
genuine
a
start
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
as
bud
means
did
ralph
said
yes
that
he
thought
that
was
just
it
at
least
he
guessed
if
there
was
something
more
the
man
that
was
putting
in
his
best
licks
would
be
sure
to
find
it
out
do
you
think
he
help
a
feller
seems
to
me
it
would
be
number
one
to
have
god
help
you
not
to
help
you
fight
other
folks
but
to
help
you
when
it
comes
to
fighting
the
devil
inside
but
you
see
i
do
belong
to
no
church
well
let
you
and
me
have
one
right
off
two
people
that
help
one
another
to
serve
god
make
a
church
i
am
afraid
this
ecclesiastical
theory
will
not
be
considered
orthodox
it
was
ralph
and
i
write
it
down
at
the
risk
of
bringing
him
into
condemnation
but
other
people
before
the
days
of
bud
and
ralph
have
discussed
church
organization
when
they
should
have
been
doing
christian
work
for
both
of
them
had
forgotten
the
danger
that
hung
over
the
old
until
shocky
burst
into
the
weeping
indeed
the
poor
nervous
little
frame
was
ready
to
go
into
convulsions
miss
hawkins
bud
started
at
mention
of
the
name
miss
hawkins
has
just
been
over
to
say
that
a
crowd
is
going
to
tar
and
feather
pearson
and
here
shocky
wept
again
and
he
wo
run
but
he
took
up
the
old
flintlock
and
he
die
in
his
tracks
chapter
xvi
the
church
militant
bud
was
doubly
enlisted
on
the
side
of
john
pearson
the
in
the
first
place
he
knew
that
this
persecution
of
the
unpopular
old
man
was
only
a
blind
to
save
somebody
else
that
they
were
thieves
who
cried
stop
thief
and
he
felt
consequently
that
this
was
a
chance
to
put
his
resolutions
into
practice
the
old
testament
religious
life
which
consists
in
fighting
the
lord
enemies
suited
bud
temper
and
education
it
might
lead
to
something
better
it
was
the
best
possible
to
him
now
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
have
to
acknowledge
that
there
was
a
second
motive
that
moved
bud
to
this
championship
the
good
heart
of
martha
hawkins
having
espoused
the
cause
of
the
the
heart
of
bud
means
could
not
help
feeling
warmly
on
the
same
side
blessed
is
that
man
in
whose
life
the
driving
of
duty
and
the
drawing
of
love
impel
the
same
way
but
why
speak
of
the
driving
of
duty
for
already
bud
was
learning
the
better
lesson
of
serving
god
for
the
love
of
god
the
old
was
the
most
unpopular
man
in
flat
creek
district
he
had
two
great
vices
he
would
go
to
clifty
and
have
a
spree
once
in
three
months
and
he
would
tell
the
truth
in
a
most
unscrupulous
manner
a
man
given
to
plain
speaking
was
quite
as
objectionable
in
flat
creek
as
he
would
have
been
in
france
under
the
empire
the
commune
or
the
republic
and
almost
as
objectionable
as
he
would
be
in
any
refined
community
in
america
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
have
a
horror
of
people
who
throw
stones
and
the
old
having
no
friends
was
a
good
in
driving
him
off
pete
jones
would
get
rid
of
a
dangerous
neighbor
and
divert
attention
from
himself
the
immediate
crime
of
the
was
that
he
had
happened
to
see
too
much
hartsook
said
bud
when
they
got
out
into
the
road
you
better
go
straight
home
to
the
squire
bekase
ef
this
lightnin
strikes
a
second
time
it
strike
awful
closte
to
you
you
had
better
be
seen
with
us
which
way
did
you
come
shocky
why
i
tried
to
come
down
the
holler
but
i
met
jones
right
by
the
big
road
and
he
sweared
at
me
and
said
he
kill
me
ef
i
did
go
back
and
stay
and
so
i
went
back
to
the
house
and
then
slipped
out
through
the
graveyard
you
see
i
was
bound
to
come
ef
i
got
skinned
for
pearson
stuck
to
me
and
i
mean
to
stick
to
him
you
see
bud
led
shocky
through
the
graveyard
but
when
they
reached
the
forest
path
from
the
graveyard
he
thought
that
perhaps
it
was
not
best
to
show
his
hand
as
he
expressed
it
too
soon
now
shocky
he
said
do
you
run
ahead
and
tell
the
ole
man
that
i
want
to
see
him
right
off
down
by
the
i
keep
closte
behind
you
and
ef
anybody
offers
to
trouble
you
do
you
let
off
a
yell
and
i
be
thar
in
no
time
when
ralph
left
the
he
felt
mean
there
were
bud
and
shocky
gone
on
an
errand
of
mercy
and
he
the
truant
member
of
the
church
of
the
best
licks
was
not
with
them
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
he
seemed
to
be
a
coward
and
the
more
he
despised
himself
so
yielding
as
usual
to
the
first
brave
impulse
he
leaped
nimbly
over
the
fence
and
started
briskly
through
the
forest
in
a
direction
intersecting
the
path
on
which
were
bud
and
shocky
he
came
in
sight
just
in
time
to
see
the
first
conflict
of
the
church
in
the
wilderness
with
her
foes
for
shocky
little
feet
went
more
swiftly
on
their
eager
errand
than
bud
had
anticipated
he
got
farther
out
of
bud
reach
than
the
latter
intended
he
should
and
he
did
not
discover
pete
jones
until
pete
with
his
whip
was
right
upon
him
shocky
tried
to
halloo
for
bud
but
he
was
like
one
in
a
nightmare
the
yell
died
into
a
whisper
which
could
not
have
been
heard
ten
feet
i
shall
not
repeat
jones
words
they
were
frightfully
profane
but
he
did
not
stop
at
words
he
swept
his
whip
round
and
gave
little
shocky
one
terrible
cut
then
the
voice
was
released
and
the
piercing
cry
of
pain
brought
bud
down
the
path
flying
you
scoundrel
growled
bud
you
a
coward
and
a
thief
to
be
a
little
creetur
like
him
and
with
that
bud
walked
up
on
jones
who
prudently
changed
position
in
such
a
way
as
to
get
the
upper
side
of
the
hill
well
i
gin
you
the
upper
side
but
come
on
cried
bud
ef
you
afeared
to
fight
somebody
besides
a
poor
little
sickly
baby
or
a
crippled
soldier
come
on
illustration
bud
means
comes
to
the
rescue
of
shocky
pete
was
no
insignificant
antagonist
he
had
been
a
great
fighter
and
his
arms
were
like
iron
he
had
not
the
splendid
set
of
bud
but
he
had
more
skill
and
experience
in
the
rude
tournament
of
fists
to
which
the
backwoods
is
so
much
given
now
being
out
of
sight
of
witnesses
and
sure
that
he
could
lie
about
the
fight
afterward
he
did
not
scruple
to
take
advantages
which
would
have
disgraced
him
forever
if
he
had
taken
them
in
a
public
fight
on
election
day
or
at
a
muster
he
took
the
uphill
side
and
he
clubbed
his
striking
bud
with
all
his
force
with
the
heavy
end
which
he
had
loaded
with
lead
bud
threw
up
his
strong
left
arm
and
parried
the
blow
which
however
was
so
fierce
that
it
fractured
one
of
the
bones
of
the
arm
throwing
away
his
whip
pete
rushed
upon
bud
furiously
intending
to
overpower
him
but
bud
slipped
quickly
to
one
side
and
let
jones
pass
down
the
hill
and
as
jones
came
up
again
means
dealt
him
one
crushing
blow
that
sent
him
full
length
upon
the
ground
nothing
but
the
leaves
saved
him
from
a
most
terrible
fall
jones
sprang
to
his
feet
more
angry
than
ever
at
being
whipped
by
one
whom
he
regarded
as
a
boy
and
drew
a
long
but
he
was
blind
with
rage
and
bud
dodged
the
knife
and
this
time
gave
pete
a
blow
on
the
nose
which
marred
the
homeliness
of
that
feature
and
doubled
the
fellow
up
against
a
tree
ten
feet
away
ralph
came
in
sight
in
time
to
see
the
beginning
of
the
fight
and
he
arrived
on
the
ground
just
as
pete
jones
went
down
under
the
blow
from
the
only
remaining
fist
of
bud
means
while
ralph
examined
bud
disabled
left
arm
pete
picked
himself
up
slowly
and
muttering
that
he
felt
shuck
up
like
crawled
away
like
a
whipped
puppy
to
every
one
whom
he
met
pete
whose
intellect
seemed
to
have
weakened
in
sympathy
with
his
frame
remarked
feebly
that
he
was
shuck
up
like
and
vouchsafed
no
other
explanation
even
to
his
wife
he
only
said
that
he
felt
purty
shuck
up
like
and
that
the
boys
would
have
to
get
on
without
him
there
are
some
scoundrels
whose
very
malignity
is
shaken
out
of
them
for
the
time
being
by
a
thorough
drubbing
i
afraid
you
going
to
have
trouble
with
your
arm
bud
said
ralph
tenderly
never
mind
i
put
in
my
best
licks
fer
that
air
time
mr
hartsook
ralph
shivered
a
little
at
thought
of
this
but
if
it
was
right
to
knock
jones
down
at
all
why
might
not
bud
do
it
heartily
as
unto
the
lord
gideon
did
not
feel
any
more
honest
pleasure
in
chastising
the
midianites
than
did
bud
in
sending
pete
jones
away
purty
shuck
up
like
chapter
xvii
a
council
of
war
shocky
whose
feet
had
flown
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
final
fall
of
pete
jones
told
the
whole
story
to
the
wondering
and
admiring
ears
of
miss
hawkins
who
unhappily
could
not
remember
anything
at
the
east
just
like
it
to
the
frightened
ears
of
the
rheumatic
old
lady
who
felt
sure
her
ole
man
talk
and
stubbornness
would
be
the
ruin
of
him
and
to
the
indignant
ears
of
the
old
soldier
who
was
hobbling
up
and
down
in
front
of
his
cabin
standing
guard
over
himself
no
i
wo
leave
he
said
to
ralph
and
bud
you
see
i
jest
wo
what
would
winfield
scott
say
ef
he
knew
that
one
of
them
as
fit
at
lundy
lane
backed
out
retreated
run
fer
fear
of
a
passel
of
thieves
no
sir
me
and
the
old
flintlock
will
live
and
die
together
i
put
a
thunderin
charge
of
buckshot
into
the
first
one
of
them
scoundrels
as
comes
up
the
holler
it
be
another
lundy
lane
and
you
hartsook
may
send
scott
word
that
ole
pearson
as
fit
at
lundy
lane
under
him
died
thieves
on
rocky
branch
in
hoopole
kyounty
state
of
injeanny
and
the
old
man
hobbled
faster
and
faster
taxing
his
wooden
leg
to
the
very
utmost
as
if
his
victory
depended
on
the
vehemence
with
which
he
walked
his
beat
pearson
sat
wringing
her
hands
and
looking
appealingly
at
martha
hawkins
who
stood
in
the
door
in
despair
looking
appealingly
at
bud
bud
was
stupefied
by
the
old
man
stubbornness
and
his
own
pain
and
in
his
turn
appealed
mutely
to
the
master
in
whose
resources
he
had
boundless
confidence
ralph
seeing
that
all
depended
on
him
was
taxing
his
wits
to
think
of
some
way
to
get
round
pearson
stubbornness
shocky
hung
to
the
old
man
coat
and
pulled
away
at
him
with
many
entreating
words
but
the
venerable
sentinel
strode
up
and
down
furiously
with
his
flintlock
on
his
shoulder
and
his
in
his
belt
just
at
this
point
somebody
could
be
seen
indistinctly
through
the
bushes
coming
up
the
hollow
halt
cried
the
old
hero
who
goes
there
it
me
pearson
do
shoot
me
please
it
was
the
voice
of
hannah
thomson
hearing
that
the
whole
neighborhood
was
rising
against
the
benefactor
of
shocky
and
of
her
family
she
had
slipped
away
from
the
eyes
of
her
mistress
and
run
with
breathless
haste
to
give
warning
in
the
cabin
on
rocky
branch
seeing
ralph
she
blushed
and
went
into
the
cabin
well
said
ralph
the
enemy
is
not
coming
yet
let
us
hold
a
council
of
war
this
thought
came
to
ralph
like
an
inspiration
it
pleased
the
old
whim
and
he
sat
down
on
the
now
i
suppose
said
ralph
that
general
winfield
scott
always
looked
into
things
a
little
before
he
went
into
a
fight
did
he
be
sure
assented
the
old
man
well
said
ralph
what
is
the
condition
of
the
enemy
i
suppose
the
whole
neighborhood
against
us
be
sure
said
the
old
man
the
rest
were
silent
but
all
felt
the
statement
to
be
about
true
next
said
ralph
i
suppose
general
winfield
scott
would
always
inquire
into
the
condition
of
his
own
troops
now
let
us
see
captain
pearson
has
bud
who
is
the
right
wing
badly
crippled
by
having
his
arm
broken
in
the
first
battle
miss
hawkins
looked
pale
be
sure
said
the
old
man
and
i
am
the
left
wing
pretty
good
at
giving
advice
but
very
slender
in
a
fight
be
sure
said
the
old
man
and
shocky
and
miss
martha
and
hannah
good
aids
but
nothing
in
a
battle
be
sure
said
the
a
little
doubtfully
now
let
look
at
the
arms
and
accouterments
i
think
you
call
them
well
this
old
musket
has
been
loaded
this
ten
year
said
the
old
lady
and
the
lock
is
so
rusty
that
you
could
not
cock
it
when
you
wanted
to
take
aim
at
hannah
the
old
man
looked
foolish
and
muttered
be
sure
and
there
is
another
round
of
ammunition
in
the
house
the
old
man
was
silent
now
let
us
look
at
the
incumbrances
here
the
old
lady
and
shocky
if
you
fight
the
enemy
will
be
pleased
it
will
give
them
a
chance
to
kill
you
and
then
the
old
lady
will
die
and
they
will
do
with
shocky
as
they
please
be
sure
said
the
old
man
reflectively
now
said
ralph
general
winfield
scott
under
such
circumstances
would
retreat
in
good
order
then
when
he
could
muster
his
forces
rightly
he
would
drive
the
enemy
from
his
ground
to
be
sure
said
the
old
man
what
ort
i
to
do
have
you
any
friends
well
yes
ther
my
brother
over
in
jackson
kyounty
i
mout
go
there
well
said
bud
do
you
just
go
down
to
and
stay
there
them
folks
wo
be
here
tell
midnight
i
come
fer
you
at
nine
with
my
roan
colt
and
i
set
you
down
over
on
the
big
road
on
buckeye
run
then
you
can
git
on
the
that
passes
there
about
five
in
the
mornin
and
go
over
to
jackson
county
and
keep
shady
till
we
want
you
to
face
the
enemy
and
to
swear
agin
some
folks
and
then
well
send
fer
you
to
be
sure
said
the
old
man
in
a
broken
voice
i
reckon
general
winfield
scott
would
disapprove
of
such
a
maneuver
as
that
thar
miss
martha
beamed
on
bud
to
his
evident
delight
for
he
carried
his
painful
arm
part
of
the
way
home
with
her
ralph
noticed
that
hannah
looked
at
with
a
look
full
of
contending
emotions
he
read
admiration
gratitude
and
doubt
in
the
expression
of
her
face
as
she
turned
toward
home
well
ole
woman
said
pearson
as
he
took
up
his
little
handkerchief
full
of
things
and
started
for
his
i
did
never
think
i
desart
you
and
ef
the
old
flintlock
had
a
been
rusty
i
a
staid
and
died
right
here
by
the
ole
cabin
but
i
reckon
best
to
be
brash
and
shocky
looked
after
him
as
he
hobbled
away
over
the
stones
more
than
ever
convinced
that
god
had
forgotten
all
about
things
on
flat
creek
he
gravely
expressed
his
opinion
to
the
master
the
next
day

the
elaborate
etymological

a

something

it
is

the
or
as
it
was
sometimes
by
a
curious
perversion
called
the
was
a
spring
running
out
of
a
fissure
in
a
high
limestone
cliff
here
the
old
man
sheltered
himself
on
that
dreary
christmas
evening
until
bud
brought
his
roan
colt
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
above
and
he
and
ralph
helped
the
old
man
up
the
cliff
and
into
the
saddle
ralph
went
back
to
bed
but
bud
who
was
only
too
eager
to
put
in
his
best
licks
walked
by
the
side
of
old
john
pearson
the
six
miles
over
to
buckeye
run
and
at
last
after
eleven
he
deposited
him
in
a
hollow
sycamore
by
the
road
there
to
wait
the
coming
of
the
that
would
carry
him
into
jackson
county
said
the
as
bud
mounted
the
colt
to
return
ef
i
wanted
jest
send
me
word
and
i
make
a
forrard
movement
any
time
i
do
like
this
thing
of
running
off
in
the
but
i
reckon
general
winfield
scott
would
a
ordered
a
retreat
ef
he
a
been
in
my
shoes
i
lots
obleeged
to
you
akordin
to
my
tell
we
all
of
us
selfish
in
everything
but
i
be
ef
i
do
believe
you
and
one
or
two
more
is
exceptions
whether
it
was
that
the
fact
that
pete
jones
had
got
shuck
up
demoralized
his
followers
or
whether
it
was
that
the
old
flight
was
suspected
the
mob
did
not
turn
out
in
very
great
force
and
the
tarring
was
postponed
indefinitely
for
by
the
time
they
came
together
it
became
known
somehow
that
the
man
with
a
wooden
leg
had
outrun
them
all
but
the
escape
of
one
devoted
victim
did
not
mollify
the
feelings
of
the
people
toward
the
next
one
by
the
time
bud
returned
his
arm
was
very
painful
and
the
next
day
he
went
under
small
treatment
to
reduce
the
fracture
whatever
suspicions
bud
might
have
of
pete
jones
he
was
not
afflicted
with
ralph
dread
of
the
silent
young
doctor
and
if
there
was
anything
small
admired
it
was
physical
strength
and
courage
small
wanted
bud
on
his
side
and
least
of
all
did
he
want
him
to
be
ralph
champion
so
that
the
silent
cool
and
skillful
doctor
went
to
work
to
make
an
impression
on
bud
means
other
influences
were
at
work
upon
him
also
means
volleyed
and
thundered
in
her
usual
style
about
his
takin
up
with
a
thief
and
runnin
arter
that
master
that
was
a
mighty
suspicious
kind
of
a
customer
akordin
to
her
tell
she
allers
said
so
ef
she
a
been
consulted
he
would
a
been
hired
he
war
fit
company
fer
nobody
and
old
jack
means
bud
must
want
to
have
barns
burnt
like
some
other
folkses
had
been
fer
his
part
he
had
sense
enough
to
know
they
was
some
people
as
it
would
do
to
set
a
body
self
agin
and
as
fer
him
he
did
butt
his
brains
out
agin
a
not
when
he
was
sober
and
so
they
managed
during
bud
confinement
to
the
house
to
keep
him
well
supplied
with
all
the
ordinary
discomforts
of
life
but
one
visit
from
martha
hawkins
ten
words
of
kindly
inquiry
from
her
and
the
remark
that
his
broken
arm
reminded
her
of
something
she
had
seen
at
the
east
and
something
somebody
said
the
time
she
was
to
bosting
were
enough
to
repay
the
champion
a
thousand
fold
for
all
that
he
suffered
indeed
that
visit
and
the
recollection
of
ralph
saying
that
jesus
christ
was
a
sort
of
a
flat
creeker
himself
were
manna
in
the
wilderness
to
bud
poor
shocky
was
sick
the
excitement
had
been
too
much
for
him
and
though
his
fever
was
very
slight
it
was
enough
to
produce
just
a
little
delirium
either
ralph
or
miss
martha
was
generally
at
the
cabin
they
coming
said
shocky
to
ralph
they
coming
pete
jones
is
to
bind
me
out
for
a
hundred
years
i
wish
hanner
would
hold
me
so
he
could
god
forgot
all
about
us
here
in
flat
creek
and
there
nobody
to
help
it
and
he
shivered
at
every
sudden
sound
he
was
never
free
from
this
delirious
fright
except
when
the
master
held
him
tight
in
his
arms
he
staggered
around
the
floor
the
very
shadow
of
shocky
and
was
so
terrified
by
the
approach
of
darkness
that
ralph
staid
in
the
cabin
on
wednesday
night
and
miss
hawkins
staid
on
thursday
night
on
friday
bud
sent
a
note
to
ralph
askin
him
to
come
and
see
him
you
see
hartsook
i
forgot
what
was
said
about
puttin
in
our
best
licks
for
jesus
christ
i
been
to
read
some
about
him
while
i
set
here
and
i
read
where
he
said
somethin
about
doing
fer
the
least
of
his
brethren
being
as
the
same
like
as
if
it
was
done
fer
jesus
christ
now
there
shocky
i
reckon
as
anybody
is
a
little
brother
of
jesus
christ
it
is
that
shocky
pete
jones
and
his
brother
bill
is
determined
to
have
him
back
there
bekase
you
see
pete
one
of
the
county
commissioners
and
the
day
that
they
bind
out
he
wants
to
bind
out
that
boy
jes
to
spite
ole
pearson
and
you
and
me
you
see
the
ole
woman
been
helped
by
the
neighbors
and
he
claim
shocky
to
be
a
pauper
and
they
no
human
soul
here
as
dares
to
do
a
thing
to
pete
could
you
git
him
over
to
lewisburg
i
lend
you
my
roan
colt
ralph
thought
a
minute
he
dared
not
take
shocky
to
the
uncle
where
he
found
his
only
home
but
there
was
miss
nancy
sawyer
the
old
maid
who
was
everybody
blessing
he
could
ask
her
to
keep
him
and
at
any
rate
he
would
save
shocky
somehow
as
he
went
out
in
the
dusk
he
met
hannah
in
the
lane
chapter
xix
face
to
face
in
the
lane
in
the
dark
under
the
shadow
of
the
barn
ralph
met
hannah
carrying
her
bucket
of
milk
they
have
no
pails
in
indiana
he
could
see
only
the
white
foam
on
the
milk
and
hannah
white
face
perhaps
it
was
well
that
he
could
not
see
how
white
hannah
face
was
at
that
moment
when
a
sudden
trembling
made
her
set
down
the
heavy
bucket
at
first
neither
spoke
the
recollection
of
all
the
joy
of
that
walk
together
in
the
night
came
upon
them
both
and
a
great
sense
of
loss
made
the
night
seem
supernaturally
dark
to
ralph
nor
was
it
any
lighter
in
the
hopeless
heart
of
the
bound
girl
the
presence
of
ralph
did
not
now
as
before
make
the
darkness
of
her
life
light
hannah
said
ralph
presently
and
stopped
for
he
could
not
finish
the
sentence
with
a
rush
there
came
upon
him
a
consciousness
of
the
suspicions
that
filled
hannah
mind
and
with
it
there
came
a
feeling
of
guilt
he
saw
himself
from
her
and
felt
a
remorse
almost
as
keen
as
it
could
have
been
had
he
been
a
criminal
and
this
sudden
and
morbid
sense
of
his
guilt
as
it
appeared
to
hannah
paralyzed
him
but
when
hannah
lifted
her
bucket
with
her
hand
and
the
world
with
her
heavy
heart
and
essayed
to
pass
him
ralph
rallied
and
said
do
believe
all
these
lies
that
are
told
about
me
i
do
believe
anything
hartsook
that
is
i
do
want
to
believe
anything
against
you
and
i
would
mind
anything
they
say
if
it
was
for
two
things
here
she
stammered
and
looked
down
if
it
was
for
what
said
ralph
with
a
spice
of
indignant
denial
in
his
voice
hannah
hesitated
but
ralph
pressed
the
question
with
eagerness
i
saw
you
cross
that
pasture
the
night
the
night
that
you
walked
home
with
me
she
would
have
said
the
night
of
the
robbery
but
her
heart
smote
her
and
she
adopted
the
more
kindly
form
of
the
sentence
ralph
would
have
explained
but
how
i
did
cross
the
pasture
he
began
but
just
here
it
occurred
to
ralph
that
there
was
no
reason
for
his
night
excursion
across
the
pasture
hannah
again
took
up
her
bucket
but
he
said
tell
me
what
else
you
have
against
me
i
have
anything
against
you
only
i
am
poor
and
friendless
and
you
ought
to
make
my
life
any
heavier
they
say
that
you
have
paid
attention
to
a
great
many
girls
i
do
know
why
you
should
want
to
trifle
with
me
ralph
answered
her
this
time
he
spoke
low
he
spoke
as
though
he
were
speaking
to
god
if
any
man
says
that
i
ever
trifled
with
any
woman
he
lies
i
have
never
loved
but
one
and
you
know
who
that
is
and
god
knows
i
do
know
what
to
say
mr
hartsook
hannah
voice
was
broken
these
solemn
words
of
love
were
like
a
river
in
the
desert
and
she
was
like
a
wanderer
dying
of
thirst
i
do
know
hartsook
if
i
was
alone
it
would
matter
but
i
got
my
blind
mother
and
my
poor
shocky
to
look
after
and
i
do
want
to
make
mistakes
and
the
world
is
so
full
of
lies
i
do
know
what
to
believe
somehow
i
ca
help
believing
what
you
say
you
seem
to
speak
so
true
but
but
what
said
ralph
but
you
know
how
i
saw
you
just
as
kind
to
martha
hawkins
on
sunday
as
as
han
ner
it
was
the
melodious
voice
of
the
angry
means
and
hannah
lifted
her
pail
and
disappeared
standing
in
the
shadow
of
his
own
despair
ralph
felt
how
dark
a
night
could
be
when
it
had
no
promise
of
morning
and
small
who
had
been
stabling
his
horse
just
inside
the
barn
came
out
and
moved
quietly
into
the
house
just
as
though
he
had
not
listened
intently
to
every
word
of
the
conversation
as
ralph
walked
away
he
tried
to
comfort
himself
by
calling
to
his
aid
the
bulldog
in
his
character
but
somehow
it
did
not
do
him
any
good
for
what
is
a
bulldog
but
a
stoic
philosopher
stoicism
has
its
value
but
ralph
had
come
to
a
place
where
stoicism
was
of
no
account
the
memory
of
the
helper
of
his
sorrow
his
brave
and
victorious
endurance
came
when
stoicism
failed
happiness
might
go
out
of
life
but
in
the
light
of
christ
life
happiness
seemed
but
a
small
element
anyhow
the
love
of
woman
might
be
denied
him
but
there
still
remained
what
was
infinitely
more
precious
and
holy
the
love
of
god
there
still
remained
the
possibility
of
heroic
living
working
suffering
and
enduring
still
remained
and
he
who
can
work
for
god
and
endure
for
god
surely
has
yet
the
best
of
life
left
and
like
the
knights
who
could
find
the
holy
grail
only
in
losing
themselves
hartsook
in
throwing
his
happiness
out
of
the
count
found
the
purest
happiness
a
sense
of
the
victory
of
the
soul
over
the
tribulations
of
life
the
man
who
knows
this
victory
scarcely
needs
the
encouragement
of
the
hope
of
future
happiness
there
is
a
real
heaven
in
bravely
lifting
the
load
of
one
own
sorrow
and
work
and
it
was
a
good
thing
for
ralph
that
the
danger
hanging
over
shocky
made
immediate
action
necessary

chapter

god
remembers
shocky
at
four
the
next
morning
in
the
midst
of
a
driving
snow
ralph
went
timidly
up
the
lane
toward
the
homely
castle
of
the
meanses
he
went
timidly
for
he
was
afraid
of
bull
but
he
found
bud
waiting
for
him
with
the
roan
colt
bridled
and
saddled
the
roan
colt
was
really
a
large
full
of
the
finest
sort
of
animal
life
and
having
as
bud
declared
a
mighty
sight
of
hoss
sense
fer
his
age
he
seemed
to
understand
at
once
that
there
was
something
extraordinary
on
hand
when
he
was
brought
out
of
his
comfortable
quarters
at
four
in
the
morning
in
the
midst
of
a
bud
was
sure
that
the
roan
colt
felt
his
responsibility
in
the
days
that
followed
ralph
often
had
occasion
to
remember
this
interview
with
bud
who
had
risked
much
in
bringing
his
fractured
arm
out
into
the
cold
damp
air
jonathan
never
clave
to
david
more
earnestly
than
did
bud
this
december
morning
to
ralph
you
see
hartsook
said
bud
i
wish
i
was
well
myself
it
hard
to
set
still
but
it
me
a
heap
of
good
i
like
a
boy
at
school
and
i
out
that
doing
one
best
licks
fer
others
ai
all
they
is
of
it
though
it
a
good
part
i
feel
like
as
if
i
must
git
him
you
know
to
do
lots
for
me
they
always
some
sums
too
hard
fer
a
feller
and
he
has
to
ax
the
master
to
do
you
know
but
see
the
roan
round
he
wants
to
be
off
do
you
know
i
think
that
hoss
knows
something
up
i
think
he
puts
in
his
best
licks
fer
me
a
good
deal
better
than
i
do
fer
him
ralph
pressed
bud
right
hand
bud
rubbed
his
face
against
the
nose
and
said
put
in
your
best
licks
old
fellow
and
the
colt
whinnied
how
a
horse
must
want
to
speak
for
bud
was
right
men
are
gods
to
horses
and
they
serve
their
deities
with
a
faithfulness
that
shames
us
then
ralph
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
the
roan
as
if
wishing
to
show
bud
his
willingness
broke
into
a
swinging
gallop
and
was
soon
lost
to
the
sight
of
his
master
in
the
darkness
and
the
snow
when
bud
could
no
more
hear
the
sound
of
the
roan
footsteps
he
returned
to
the
house
to
lie
awake
picturing
to
himself
the
journey
of
ralph
with
shocky
and
the
roan
colt
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
bud
that
the
roan
which
was
almost
a
part
of
himself
represented
him
in
this
ride
and
he
knew
the
roan
well
enough
to
feel
sure
that
he
would
do
credit
to
his
master
put
in
his
best
licks
bud
whispered
to
himself
many
a
time
before
daybreak
the
ground
was
but
little
frozen
and
the
snow
made
the
roads
more
slippery
than
ever
but
the
roan
handled
his
feet
dexterously
and
with
a
playful
and
somewhat
air
as
though
he
said
did
i
do
it
handsomely
that
time
down
slippery
hills
through
deep
covered
with
a
slender
film
of
ice
he
trod
with
perfect
assurance
and
then
up
over
the
rough
stones
of
rocky
hollow
where
there
was
no
road
at
all
he
picked
his
way
through
the
darkness
and
snow
ralph
could
not
tell
where
he
was
at
last
but
gave
the
reins
to
the
roan
who
did
his
duty
bravely
and
not
without
a
little
flourish
to
show
that
he
had
yet
plenty
of
spare
power
a
feeble
making
the
dense
visible
marked
for
ralph
the
site
of
the
cabin
miss
martha
had
been
admitted
to
the
secret
and
had
joined
in
the
conspiracy
heartily
without
being
able
to
recall
anything
of
the
kind
having
occurred
at
the
east
and
not
remembering
having
seen
or
heard
of
anything
of
the
sort
the
time
she
was
to
bosting
she
had
shocky
all
ready
having
used
some
of
her
own
capes
and
shawls
to
make
him
warm
miss
martha
came
out
to
meet
ralph
when
she
heard
the
feet
of
the
roan
before
the
door
o
hartsook
is
that
you
what
a
storm
this
is
jest
the
way
it
snows
at
the
east
shocky
all
ready
he
did
know
a
thing
about
it
tell
i
waked
him
this
morning
ever
since
that
he
been
saying
that
god
has
forgot
after
all
it
made
me
cry
once
and
shocky
kissed
pearson
and
told
her
that
when
he
got
away
from
flat
creek
he
tell
god
all
about
it
and
god
would
bring
pearson
back
again
and
then
martha
hawkins
lifted
the
frail
little
form
bundled
in
shawls
in
her
arms
and
brought
him
out
into
the
storm
and
before
she
handed
him
up
he
embraced
her
and
said
o
miss
hawkins
god
forgot
me
after
all
tell
hanner
that
he
forgot
i
going
to
ask
him
to
git
her
away
from
means
and
mother
out
of
the
i
ask
him
just
as
soon
as
i
get
to
lewisburg
ralph
lifted
the
trembling
form
into
his
arms
and
the
little
fellow
only
looked
up
in
the
face
of
the
master
and
said
you
see
hartsook
i
thought
god
had
forgot
but
he
and
the
words
of
the
little
boy
comforted
the
master
also
god
had
not
forgotten
him
either
from
the
moment
that
ralph
took
shocky
into
his
arms
the
conduct
of
the
roan
colt
underwent
an
entire
revolution
before
that
he
had
gone
over
a
bad
place
with
a
rush
as
though
he
were
ambitious
of
distinguishing
himself
by
his
brilliant
execution
now
he
trod
none
the
less
surely
but
he
trod
tenderly
the
neck
was
no
longer
arched
he
set
himself
to
his
work
as
steadily
as
though
he
were
twenty
years
old
for
miles
he
traveled
on
in
a
long
swinging
walk
putting
his
feet
down
carefully
and
firmly
and
ralph
found
the
spirit
of
the
colt
entering
into
himself
he
cut
the
with
his
face
and
felt
a
sense
of
triumph
over
all
his
difficulties
the
bulldog
jaws
had
been
his
teacher
and
now
the
steady
strong
and
conscientious
legs
of
the
roan
inspired
him
shocky
had
not
spoken
he
lay
listening
to
the
pattering
music
of
the
horse
feet
doubtless
framing
the
footsteps
of
the
roan
colt
into
an
anthem
of
praise
to
the
god
who
had
not
forgot
but
as
the
dawn
came
on
making
the
snow
whiter
he
raised
himself
and
said
as
he
watched
the
flakes
chasing
one
another
in
whirling
eddies
that
the
snow
seemed
to
be
having
a
good
time
of
it
then
he
leaned
down
again
on
the
master
bosom
full
of
a
still
joy
and
only
roused
himself
from
his
happy
reverie
to
ask
what
that
big
house
was
see
hartsook
how
big
it
is
and
how
little
and
ugly
the
windows
is
and
the
boards
is
peeling
off
all
over
it
and
the
hogs
is
right
in
the
front
yard
it
do
look
just
like
a
house
it
looks
dreadful
what
is
it
ralph
had
dreaded
this
question
he
did
not
answer
it
but
asked
shocky
to
change
his
position
a
little
and
then
he
quickened
the
pace
of
the
horse
but
shocky
was
a
poet
and
a
poet
understands
silence
more
quickly
than
he
does
speech
the
little
fellow
shivered
as
the
truth
came
to
him
is
that
the
he
said
catching
his
breath
is
my
mother
in
that
place
you
take
me
in
there
so
as
i
can
just
kiss
her
once
she
ca
see
much
you
know
and
one
kiss
from
me
will
make
her
feel
so
good
and
i
tell
her
that
god
forgot
he
had
raised
up
and
caught
hold
of
ralph
coat
ralph
had
great
difficulty
in
quieting
him
he
told
him
that
if
he
went
in
there
bill
jones
might
claim
that
he
was
a
runaway
and
belonged
there
and
poor
shocky
only
shivered
and
said
he
was
cold
a
minute
later
ralph
found
that
he
was
shaking
with
a
chill
and
a
horrible
dread
came
over
him
what
if
shocky
should
die
it
was
only
a
work
to
get
down
take
the
warm
from
under
the
saddle
and
wrap
it
about
the
boy
then
to
strip
off
his
own
overcoat
and
add
that
to
it
it
was
now
daylight
and
finding
after
he
had
mounted
that
shocky
continued
to
shiver
he
put
the
roan
to
his
best
speed
for
the
rest
of
the
way
trotting
up
and
down
the
slippery
hills
and
galloping
away
on
the
level
ground
how
bravely
the
roan
laid
himself
to
his
work
making
the
fly
past
in
a
long
procession
but
poor
little
shocky
was
too
cold
to
notice
them
and
ralph
shuddered
lest
shocky
should
never
be
warm
again
and
spoke
to
the
roan
and
the
roan
stretched
out
his
head
and
dropped
one
ear
back
to
hear
the
first
word
of
command
and
stretched
the
other
forward
to
listen
for
danger
and
then
flew
with
a
splendid
speed
down
the
road
past
the
patches
of
blackberry
briars
past
the
elderberry
bushes
past
the
familiar
tree
in
the
over
the
bridge
without
regard
to
the
threat
of
a
fine
and
at
last
up
the
long
lane
into
the
village
where
the
smoke
from
the
chimneys
was
caught
and
whirled
round
with
the
snow
chapter
xxi
miss
nancy
sawyer
in
a
little
old
cottage
in
lewisburg
on
one
of
the
streets
which
was
never
traveled
except
by
a
solitary
cow
seeking
pasture
or
a
countryman
bringing
wood
to
some
one
of
the
families
living
in
it
and
which
in
summer
was
decked
with
a
profusion
of
the
yellow
and
white
blossoms
of
the
in
this
unfrequented
street
so
generously
and
unnecessarily
broad
lived
miss
nancy
sawyer
and
her
younger
sister
semantha
miss
nancy
was
a
providence
one
of
those
old
maids
that
are
benedictions
to
the
whole
town
one
of
those
in
whom
the
wanting
the
natural
objects
on
which
to
spend
itself
overflows
all
bounds
and
lavishes
itself
on
every
needy
thing
and
grows
richer
and
more
abundant
with
the
spending
a
fountain
of
inexhaustible
blessing
there
is
no
nobler
life
possible
to
any
one
than
to
an
unmarried
woman
the
more
shame
that
some
choose
a
selfish
one
and
thus
turn
to
gall
all
the
affection
with
which
they
are
endowed
miss
nancy
sawyer
had
been
ralph
teacher
and
it
was
precious
little
so
far
as
information
went
that
he
learned
from
her
for
she
never
could
conceive
of
jerusalem
as
a
place
in
any
essential
regard
very
different
from
lewisburg
where
she
had
spent
her
life
but
ralph
learned
from
her
what
most
teachers
fail
to
teach
the
great
lesson
of
christianity
by
the
side
of
which
all
antiquities
and
geographies
and
chronologies
and
exegetics
and
other
niceties
are
as
nothing
and
now
he
turned
the
head
of
the
roan
toward
the
cottage
of
miss
nancy
sawyer
as
naturally
as
the
roan
would
have
gone
to
his
own
stall
in
the
stable
at
home
the
snow
had
gradually
ceased
to
fall
and
was
eddying
round
the
house
when
ralph
dismounted
from
his
foaming
horse
and
carrying
the
still
form
of
shocky
as
reverently
as
though
it
had
been
something
heavenly
knocked
at
miss
nancy
sawyer
door
with
natural
feminine
instinct
that
lady
started
back
when
she
saw
hartsook
for
she
had
just
built
a
fire
in
the
stove
and
she
now
stood
at
the
door
with
unwashed
face
and
uncombed
hair
why
ralph
hartsook
where
did
you
drop
down
from
and
what
have
you
got
i
came
from
flat
creek
this
morning
and
i
brought
you
a
little
angel
who
has
got
out
of
heaven
and
needs
some
of
your
motherly
care
shocky
was
brought
in
the
chill
shook
him
now
by
fits
only
for
a
fever
had
spotted
his
cheeks
already
who
are
you
said
miss
nancy
as
she
unwrapped
him
i
shocky
a
little
boy
as
god
forgot
and
then
thought
of
again
chapter

pancakes
half
an
hour
later
ralph
having
seen
miss
nancy
sawyer
machinery
of
warm
baths
and
simple
remedies
safely
in
operation
and
having
seen
the
roan
colt
comfortably
stabled
and
rewarded
for
his
faithfulness
by
a
bountiful
supply
of
the
best
hay
and
the
promise
of
oats
when
he
was
cool
half
an
hour
later
ralph
was
doing
the
most
ample
satisfactory
and
amazing
justice
to
his
aunt
matilda
hot
and
warm
coffee
and
after
his
life
in
flat
creek
aunt
matilda
house
did
look
like
paradise
how
white
the
how
bright
the
how
clean
the
how
glistening
the
brass
how
spotless
everything
that
came
under
the
sovereign
sway
of
matilda
white
for
in
every
indiana
village
as
large
as
lewisburg
there
are
generally
a
women
who
are
admitted
to
be
the
best
housekeepers
all
others
are
only
imitators
and
the
strife
is
between
these
for
the
it
is
at
least
safe
to
say
that
no
other
in
lewisburg
stood
so
high
as
an
enemy
to
dirt
and
as
a
rat
roach
and
mouse
exterminator
as
did
matilda
white
the
wife
of
ralph
maternal
uncle
robert
white
a
lawyer
in
successful
practice
of
course
no
member
of
white
family
ever
stayed
at
home
longer
than
was
necessary
her
husband
found
his
office
which
he
kept
in
as
bad
a
state
as
possible
in
order
to
maintain
an
equilibrium
in
his
life
much
more
comfortable
than
the
stiffly
clean
house
at
home
from
the
time
that
ralph
had
come
to
live
as
a
at
his
uncle
he
had
ever
crossed
the
threshold
of
aunt
matilda
temple
of
cleanliness
with
a
horrible
sense
of
awe
and
walter
johnson
her
son
by
a
former
marriage
had
poor
fellow
been
driven
into
bad
company
and
bad
habits
by
the
wretchedness
of
extreme
civilization
and
yet
he
showed
the
hereditary
trait
for
all
the
genius
which
white
consecrated
to
the
glorious
work
of
making
her
house
too
neat
to
be
habitable
her
son
walter
gave
to
tying
exquisite
knots
in
his
colored
cravats
and
combing
his
oiled
locks
so
as
to
look
like
a
dandy
barber
and
she
had
no
other
children
the
kind
providence
that
watches
over
the
destiny
of
children
takes
care
that
very
few
of
them
are
lodged
in
these
terribly
clean
houses
but
walter
was
not
at
the
table
and
ralph
had
so
much
anxiety
lest
his
absence
should
be
significant
of
evil
that
he
did
not
venture
to
inquire
after
him
as
he
sat
there
between
and
white
disposing
of
aunt
matilda
cakes
with
an
appetite
only
justified
by
his
long
morning
ride
and
the
excellence
of
the
brown
cakes
the
golden
honey
and
the
coffee
enriched
as
aunt
matilda
always
was
with
the
most
generous
cream
aunt
matilda
was
so
absorbed
in
telling
of
the
doings
of
the
dorcas
society
that
she
entirely
forgot
to
be
surprised
at
the
early
hour
of
ralph
arrival
when
she
had
described
the
number
of
the
garments
finished
to
be
sent
to
the
five
points
mission
or
the
home
for
the
friendless
or
the
south
sea
islands
i
forget
which
ralph
thought
he
saw
his
chance
while
aunt
matilda
was
in
a
benevolent
mood
to
broach
a
plan
he
had
been
revolving
for
some
time
but
when
he
looked
at
aunt
matilda
immaculate
horribly
immaculate
housekeeping
his
heart
failed
him
and
he
would
have
said
nothing
had
she
not
inadvertently
opened
the
door
herself
how
did
you
get
here
so
early
ralph
and
aunt
matilda
face
was
shadowed
with
a
coming
rebuke
by
early
rising
said
ralph
but
seeing
the
gathering
frown
on
his
aunt
brow
he
hastened
to
tell
the
story
of
shocky
as
well
as
he
could
white
did
not
give
way
to
any
impulse
toward
sympathy
until
she
learned
that
shocky
was
safely
housed
with
miss
nancy
sawyer
yes
sister
sawyer
has
no
family
cares
she
said
by
way
of
smoothing
her
slightly
ruffled
complacency
she
has
no
family
cares
and
she
can
do
those
things
sometimes
i
think
she
lets
people
impose
on
her
and
keep
her
away
from
the
means
of
grace
and
i
spoke
to
our
new
preacher
about
it
the
last
time
he
was
here
and
asked
him
to
speak
to
sister
sawyer
about
staying
away
from
the
ordinances
to
wait
on
everybody
but
he
is
a
queer
man
and
he
only
said
that
he
supposed
sister
sawyer
neglected
the
inferior
ordinances
that
she
might
attend
to
higher
ones
but
i
do
see
any
sense
in
a
minister
of
the
gospel
calling
a
lower
ordinance
than
feeding
to
last
baby
but
has
this
little
boy
shocking
or
what
do
you
call
him
got
any
mother
yes
said
ralph
and
that
was
just
what
i
was
going
to
say
and
he
proceeded
to
tell
how
anxious
shocky
was
to
see
his
mother
and
actually
ventured
to
wind
up
his
remarks
by
suggesting
that
mother
be
invited
to
stay
over
sunday
in
aunt
matilda
house
bless
my
stars
said
that
astounded
saint
fetch
a
pauper
here
what
crazy
notions
you
have
got
fetch
her
here
out
of
the
why
she
would
be
fit
to
sleep
in
my
here
aunt
matilda
choked
the
bare
thought
of
having
a
pauper
in
her
billowy
beds
whose
snowy
whiteness
was
frightful
to
any
ordinary
mortal
the
bare
thought
of
the
contagion
of
the
taking
possession
of
one
of
her
beds
smothered
her
and
then
you
know
sore
eyes
are
very
catching
ralph
boiled
a
little
aunt
matilda
do
you
think
dorcas
was
afraid
of
sore
eyes
it
was
a
center
shot
and
the
lawyerlike
enjoyed
a
good
hit
and
he
enjoyed
a
good
hit
at
his
wife
best
of
all
for
he
never
ventured
on
one
himself
but
aunt
matilda
felt
that
a
direct
reply
was
impossible
she
was
not
a
lawyer
but
a
woman
and
so
dodged
the
question
by
making
a
it
seems
to
me
ralph
that
you
have
picked
up
some
very
low
associates
and
you
go
around
at
night
i
am
told
you
get
over
here
by
daylight
and
i
hear
that
you
have
made
common
cause
with
a
lame
soldier
who
acts
as
a
spy
for
thieves
and
that
your
running
about
of
night
is
likely
to
get
you
into
trouble
ralph
was
hit
this
time
i
suppose
he
said
that
you
been
listening
to
some
of
henry
small
lies
why
ralph
how
you
talk
the
worst
sign
of
all
is
that
you
abuse
such
a
young
man
as
small
the
most
exemplary
christian
young
man
in
the
county
and
he
is
a
great
friend
of
yours
for
when
he
was
here
last
week
he
did
not
say
a
word
against
you
but
looked
so
sorry
when
your
being
in
trouble
was
mentioned
did
he
mr
white
white
as
in
duty
bound
said
yes
but
he
said
yes
in
a
cool
lawyerlike
way
which
showed
that
he
did
not
take
quite
so
much
stock
in
small
as
his
wife
did
this
was
a
comfort
to
ralph
who
sat
picturing
to
himself
the
silent
flattery
which
small
eyes
paid
to
his
aunt
matilda
and
the
quiet
expression
of
pain
that
would
flit
across
his
face
when
ralph
name
was
mentioned
and
never
until
that
moment
had
hartsook
understood
how
masterful
small
artifices
were
he
had
managed
to
elevate
himself
in
white
estimation
and
to
destroy
ralph
at
the
same
time
and
had
managed
to
do
both
by
a
contraction
of
the
eyebrows
but
the
silence
was
growing
painful
and
ralph
thought
to
break
it
and
turn
the
current
of
talk
from
himself
by
asking
after
white
son
where
is
walter
oh
walter
doing
well
he
went
down
to
clifty
three
weeks
ago
to
study
medicine
with
henry
small
he
seems
so
fond
of
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
is
such
an
excellent
man
you
know
and
i
have
strong
hopes
that
wallie
will
be
led
to
see
the
error
of
his
ways
by
his
association
with
henry
i
suppose
he
would
have
gone
to
see
you
but
for
the
unfavorable
reports
that
he
heard
i
hope
ralph
you
too
will
make
the
friendship
of
small
and
for
the
sake
of
your
poor
dead
mother
here
aunt
matilda
endeavored
to
show
some
emotion
for
the
sake
of
your
poor
dead
mother
but
ralph
heard
no
more
the
had
lost
their
flavor
he
remembered
that
the
colt
had
not
yet
had
his
oats
and
so
in
the
very
midst
of
aunt
matilda
affecting
allusion
to
his
mother
like
a
reprobate
that
he
was
ralph
hartsook
rose
abruptly
from
the
table
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
toward
the
stable
i
declare
said
white
descending
suddenly
from
her
high
moral
i
declare
that
boy
has
stepped
right
on
the
threshold
of
the
and
she
stuffed
her
white
handkerchief
into
her
pocket
and
took
down
the
to
wipe
off
the
imperceptible
blemish
left
by
ralph
and
white
followed
his
nephew
to
the
stable
to
request
that
he
would
be
a
little
careful
what
he
did
about
anybody
in
the
as
any
trouble
with
the
joneses
might
defeat
white
nomination
to
the
judgeship
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
chapter
xxiii
a
charitable
institution
when
ralph
got
back
to
miss
nancy
sawyer
shocky
was
sitting
up
in
bed
talking
to
miss
nancy
and
miss
semantha
his
cheeks
were
a
little
flushed
with
fever
and
the
excitement
of
telling
his
story
theirs
were
wet
with
tears
ralph
whispered
miss
nancy
as
she
drew
him
into
the
kitchen
i
want
you
to
get
a
buggy
or
a
sleigh
and
go
right
over
to
the
and
fetch
that
boy
mother
over
here
it
do
me
more
good
than
any
sermon
i
ever
heard
to
see
that
boy
in
his
mother
arms
we
can
keep
the
old
lady
over
sunday
ralph
was
delighted
so
delighted
that
he
came
near
kissing
good
miss
nancy
sawyer
whose
plain
face
was
glorified
by
her
generosity
but
he
did
not
go
to
the
immediately
he
waited
until
he
saw
bill
jones
the
superintendent
of
the
and
pete
jones
the
county
commissioner
who
was
still
somewhat
shuck
up
ride
up
to
the
then
he
drove
out
of
the
village
and
presently
hitched
his
horse
to
the
fence
and
took
a
survey
of
the
outside
forty
hogs
nearly
ready
for
slaughter
wallowed
in
a
pen
in
front
of
the
forlorn
and
dilapidated
house
for
though
the
commissioners
allowed
a
claim
for
repairs
at
every
meeting
the
repairs
were
never
made
and
it
would
not
do
to
scrutinize
jones
bills
too
closely
unless
you
gave
up
all
hope
of
renomination
to
office
one
curious
effect
of
political
aspirations
in
hoopole
county
was
to
shut
the
eyes
that
they
could
not
see
to
close
the
ears
that
they
could
not
hear
and
to
destroy
the
sense
of
smell
but
ralph
not
being
a
politician
smelled
the
without
and
the
stench
within
and
saw
everywhere
the
transparent
fraud
and
heard
the
echo
of
jones
cruelty
a
girl
admitted
him
and
as
he
did
not
wish
to
make
his
business
known
at
once
he
affected
a
sort
of
idle
interest
in
the
place
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
look
round
the
girl
watched
him
he
found
that
all
the
women
with
children
twenty
persons
in
all
were
obliged
to
sleep
in
one
room
which
owing
to
the
was
partly
under
ground
and
which
had
but
half
a
window
for
light
and
no
ventilation
except
the
chance
draft
from
the
door
jones
had
declared
that
the
women
with
children
must
stay
there
he
war
goin
to
have
brats
over
the
whole
house
here
were
vicious
women
and
good
women
with
their
children
crowded
like
chickens
in
a
coop
for
market
and
there
were
as
usual
in
such
places
helpless
idiotic
women
with
illegitimate
children
of
course
this
room
was
the
scene
of
perpetual
quarreling
and
occasional
fighting
in
the
quarters
devoted
to
the
insane
people
slightly
demented
and
raving
maniacs
were
in
the
same
rooms
while
there
were
also
those
utter
wrecks
which
sat
in
heaps
on
the
floor
mumbling
and
muttering
unintelligible
words
the
whole
current
of
their
thoughts
hopelessly
muddled
turning
around
upon
itself
in
eddies
never
ending
that
air
woman
said
the
girl
used
to
holler
a
heap
when
she
was
brought
in
here
but
pap
knows
how
to
subjue
he
slapped
her
in
the
mouth
every
time
she
hollered
she
do
make
no
furss
now
but
jist
sets
down
that
way
all
day
and
keeps
ralph
understood
it
when
she
came
in
she
was
the
victim
of
mania
but
she
had
been
beaten
into
hopeless
idiocy
indeed
this
state
of
incurable
imbecility
seemed
the
end
toward
which
all
traveled
shut
in
these
bare
rooms
with
no
treatment
no
exercise
no
variety
and
meager
food
cases
of
slight
derangement
soon
grew
into
chronic
lunacy
one
young
woman
called
phil
a
person
apparently
a
farmer
wife
came
up
to
ralph
and
looked
at
him
kindly
playing
with
the
buttons
on
his
coat
in
a
childlike
simplicity
her
dress
was
sewed
all
over
with
patches
of
white
representing
ornamental
buttons
the
womanly
instinct
toward
adornment
had
in
her
taken
this
childish
turn
do
you
think
they
ought
to
let
me
go
home
she
said
with
a
sweetness
and
a
wistful
longing
look
that
touched
ralph
to
the
heart
he
looked
at
her
and
then
at
the
muttering
crones
and
he
could
see
no
hope
of
any
better
fate
for
her
she
followed
him
round
the
rooms
returning
every
now
and
then
to
her
question
you
think
i
might
go
home
now
the
girl
had
been
called
away
for
a
moment
and
ralph
stood
looking
into
a
cell
where
there
was
a
man
with
a
gay
red
plume
in
his
hat
and
a
strip
of
red
flannel
about
his
waist
he
strutted
up
and
down
like
a
i
am
general
andrew
jackson
he
began
people
do
believe
it
but
i
am
i
had
my
head
shot
off
at
bueny
visty
and
the
new
one
that
growed
on
is
nigh
so
good
as
the
old
one
it
tater
on
one
side
why
they
take
advantage
of
me
to
shut
me
up
but
i
know
some
things
my
head
is
tater
on
one
side
but
it
all
right
on
and
when
i
know
a
thing
in
the
left
side
of
my
head
i
know
it
lean
down
here
let
me
tell
you
something
out
of
the
left
side
not
out
of
the
tater
side
mind
ye
i
would
a
told
you
if
he
had
locked
me
up
fer
nothing
jones
is
a
he
sells
the
bodies
of
the
dead
paupers
and
then
sells
the
empty
coffins
back
to
the
county
agin
but
that
all
just
then
the
girl
came
back
and
as
ralph
moved
away
general
jackson
called
out
that
all
i
tell
the
rest
another
time
and
that
out
of
the
tater
side
you
can
depend
on
that
that
out
of
the
left
side
sound
as
a
nut
on
that
side
but
ralph
began
to
wonder
where
he
should
find
hannah
mother
do
go
in
there
cried
the
girl
as
ralph
was
opening
a
door
ole
mowley
in
there
and
she
cuss
you
oh
well
if
that
all
her
curses
wo
hurt
said
hartsook
pushing
open
the
door
but
the
volley
of
blasphemy
and
vile
language
that
he
received
made
him
stagger
the
old
hag
paced
the
floor
abusing
everybody
that
came
in
her
way
and
by
the
window
in
the
same
room
feeling
the
light
that
struggled
through
the
dusty
glass
upon
her
face
sat
a
sorrowful
intelligent
englishwoman
ralph
noticed
at
once
that
she
was
english
and
in
a
few
moments
he
discovered
that
her
sight
was
defective
could
it
be
that
hannah
mother
was
the
of
this
loathsome
creature
whose
profanity
and
obscenity
did
not
intermit
for
a
moment
happily
the
girl
had
not
dared
to
brave
the
curses
of
mowley
ralph
stepped
forward
to
the
woman
by
the
window
and
greeted
her
is
this
mrs
thomson
that
is
my
name
sir
she
said
turning
her
face
toward
ralph
who
could
not
but
remark
the
contrast
between
the
thorough
refinement
of
her
manner
and
her
coarse
scant
unshaped
of
blue
drilling
i
saw
your
daughter
yesterday
did
you
see
my
boy
there
was
a
tremulousness
in
her
voice
and
an
agitation
in
her
manner
which
disclosed
the
emotion
she
strove
in
vain
to
conceal
for
only
the
day
before
bill
jones
had
informed
her
that
shocky
would
be
bound
out
on
saturday
and
that
she
would
find
that
goin
agin
him
war
a
business
so
much
as
some
others
he
mout
mention
ralph
told
her
about
shocky
safety
shall
not
write
down
the
conversation
here
critics
would
say
that
it
was
an
overwrought
scene
as
if
all
the
world
were
as
cold
as
they
all
i
can
tell
is
that
this
refined
woman
had
all
she
could
do
to
control
herself
in
her
eagerness
to
get
out
of
her
away
from
the
blasphemies
of
mowley
away
from
the
insults
of
jones
away
from
the
sights
and
sounds
and
smells
of
the
place
and
above
all
her
eagerness
to
fly
to
the
little
from
whom
she
had
been
banished
for
two
years
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
gladly
die
now
if
she
could
die
with
that
flaxen
head
upon
her
bosom
and
so
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
bill
jones
son
who
threatened
her
with
every
sort
of
evil
if
she
left
ralph
wrapped
blue
drilling
in
nancy
sawyer
shawl
and
bore
the
feeble
woman
off
to
lewisburg
and
as
they
drove
away
a
sad
childlike
voice
cried
from
the
gratings
of
the
upper
window
ralph
turned
and
saw
that
it
was
phil
poor
phil
for
whom
there
was
no
deliverance
and
all
the
way
back
ralph
pronounced
mental
maledictions
on
the
dorcas
society
not
for
sending
garments
to
the
five
points
or
the
south
sea
islands
whichever
it
was
but
for
being
so
blind
to
the
sorrow
and
poverty
within
its
reach
he
did
not
know
for
he
had
not
read
the
reports
of
the
boards
of
state
charities
that
nearly
all
are
very
much
like
this
and
that
the
state
of
new
york
is
not
better
in
this
regard
than
indiana
and
he
did
not
know
that
it
is
true
in
almost
all
other
counties
as
it
was
in
his
own
that
christian
people
do
not
think
enough
of
christ
to
look
for
him
in
these
and
while
ralph
denounced
the
dorcas
society
the
eager
hungry
heart
of
the
mother
ran
flew
toward
the
little
boy
no
i
can
not
do
it
i
can
not
tell
you
about
that
meeting
i
am
sure
that
miss
nancy
sawyer
tea
tasted
exceedingly
good
to
the
pauper
who
had
known
nothing
but
cold
water
for
years
and
that
the
bread
and
butter
were
delicious
to
a
palate
that
had
eaten
soup
for
dinner
and
coarse
bread
and
vile
molasses
for
supper
and
that
without
change
for
three
years
but
i
can
not
tell
you
how
it
seemed
that
evening
to
miss
nancy
sawyer
as
the
poor
english
lady
sat
in
speechless
ecstacy
rocking
in
the
old
in
the
while
she
pressed
to
her
bosom
with
all
the
might
of
her
enfeebled
arms
the
form
of
the
little
shocky
who
and
over
and
over
again
god
forgot
us
mother
god
forgot
us
footnotes
footnote
some
time
after
this
book
appeared
announced
his
theory
of
the
dual
brain
a
writer
in
an
english
magazine
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
discovery
had
been
anticipated
by
an
imaginative
writer
and
cited
the
passage
in
the
text
as
proving
that
the
author
of
the
hoosier
had
outrun
in
perceiving
the
duality
of
the
brain
it
is
a
matter
for
surprise
that
an
author
even
an
imaginative
one
should
have
made
so
great
a
discovery
without
suspecting
its
meaning
until
it
was
explained
by
some
one
else

the
reader
may
be
interested
to
know
that

drawn
from
the
life

general
jackson
also
between
and
i
visited
many
jails
and
with
philanthropic
purpose
publishing
the
results
of
my
examination
in
some
cases
in
chicago
some
of
the
abuses
pointed
out
were
reformed
others
linger
till
this
day
i
believe
chapter
xxiv
the
good
samaritan
the
methodist
church
to
which
matilda
white
and
miss
nancy
sawyer
belonged
was
the
leading
one
in
lewisburg
as
it
was
in
most
villages
in
indiana
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
express
my
candid
and
charitable
opinion
of
the
difference
between
the
two
women
i
shall
have
to
use
the
old
quaker
locution
and
say
that
miss
sawyer
was
a
methodist
and
likewise
a
christian
white
was
a
methodist
but
i
fear
she
was
not
likewise
as
to
the
first
part
of
this
assertion
there
was
no
room
to
doubt
miss
nancy
piety
she
could
get
happy
in
for
who
had
a
better
right
and
could
witness
a
good
experience
in
the
quarterly
but
it
is
not
upon
these
grounds
that
i
base
my
opinion
of
miss
nancy
do
not
even
the
pharisees
the
same
she
never
dreamed
that
she
had
any
right
to
speak
of
christian
perfection
which
as
partington
said
of
total
depravity
is
an
excellent
doctrine
if
it
is
lived
up
to
but
when
a
woman
heart
is
full
of
devout
affections
and
good
purposes
when
her
head
devises
liberal
and
christlike
things
when
her
hands
are
always
open
to
the
poor
and
always
busy
with
acts
of
love
and
and
when
her
feet
are
ever
eager
to
run
upon
errands
of
mercy
why
if
there
be
anything
worthy
of
being
called
christian
perfection
in
this
world
of
imperfection
i
do
not
know
why
such
an
one
does
not
possess
it
what
need
of
analyzing
her
experiences
to
find
out
the
state
of
her
soul
how
miss
nancy
managed
to
live
on
her
slender
income
and
be
so
generous
was
a
perpetual
source
of
perplexity
to
the
gossips
of
lewisburg
and
now
that
she
declared
that
thomson
and
shocky
should
not
return
to
the
there
was
a
general
outcry
from
the
whole
committee
of
intermeddlers
that
she
would
bring
herself
to
the
before
she
died
but
nancy
sawyer
was
the
richest
woman
in
lewisburg
though
nobody
knew
it
and
though
she
herself
did
not
once
suspect
it
how
miss
nancy
and
the
preacher
conspired
together
and
how
they
managed
to
bring
thomson
case
up
at
the
time
of
the
sacramental
service
in
the
afternoon
of
that
sunday
in
lewisburg
and
how
the
preacher
made
a
touching
statement
of
it
just
before
the
regular
collection
for
the
poor
was
taken
and
how
the
methodists
put
in
dollars
instead
of
dimes
while
the
presiding
elder
read
those
passages
about
zaccheus
and
other
liberal
people
and
how
the
congregation
sang
he
dies
the
friend
of
sinners
dies
more
lustily
than
ever
after
having
performed
this
christian
act
how
all
this
happened
i
can
not
take
up
the
reader
time
to
tell
but
i
can
assure
him
that
the
nearly
blind
english
woman
did
not
room
with
blasphemous
old
mowley
any
more
and
that
the
pauper
frock
gave
way
to
something
better
and
that
grave
little
shocky
even
danced
with
delight
and
declared
that
god
had
forgot
though
he
thought
that
he
had
and
matilda
white
remarked
that
it
was
a
shame
that
the
collection
for
the
poor
at
a
methodist
sacramental
service
should
be
given
to
a
woman
who
was
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
and
like
as
not
never
soundly
converted
and
shocky
slept
in
his
mother
arms
and
prayed
god
not
to
forget
hannah
while
shocky
mother
knit
stockings
for
the
store
day
and
night
and
day
and
night
she
prayed
and
hoped
chapter
xxv
bud
wooing
the
sunday
that
ralph
spent
in
lewisburg
the
sunday
that
shocky
spent
in
an
earthly
paradise
the
sunday
that
thomson
spent
with
shocky
instead
of
old
mowley
the
sunday
that
miss
nancy
thought
was
just
like
heaven
was
also
an
eventful
sunday
with
bud
means
he
had
long
adored
miss
martha
in
his
secret
heart
but
like
many
other
giants
while
brave
enough
to
face
and
fight
dragons
he
was
a
coward
in
the
presence
of
the
woman
that
he
loved
let
us
honor
him
for
it
the
man
who
loves
a
woman
truly
reverences
her
profoundly
and
feels
abashed
in
her
presence
the
man
who
is
never
abashed
in
the
presence
of
womanhood
the
man
who
tells
his
love
without
a
tremor
is
a
shallow
egotist
nature
was
not
fine
but
it
was
deep
true
and
manly
to
him
martha
hawkins
was
the
chief
of
women
what
was
he
that
he
should
aspire
to
possess
her
and
yet
on
that
sunday
with
his
crippled
arm
carefully
bound
up
with
his
cleanest
shirt
and
with
his
heavy
boots
freshly
oiled
with
the
fat
of
the
raccoon
he
started
hopefully
through
fields
white
with
snow
to
the
house
of
squire
hawkins
when
he
started
his
spirits
were
high
but
they
descended
exactly
in
proportion
to
his
proximity
to
the
object
of
his
love
he
thought
himself
not
dressed
well
enough
he
wished
his
shoulders
were
not
so
square
and
his
arms
not
so
stout
he
wished
that
he
had
enough
to
court
in
nice
big
words
and
so
by
recounting
his
own
deficiencies
he
succeeded
in
making
himself
feel
weak
and
awkward
and
generally
by
the
time
he
walked
up
between
the
rows
of
dead
hollyhocks
to
the
squire
front
door
to
tap
at
which
took
all
his
remaining
strength
miss
martha
received
her
perspiring
lover
most
graciously
but
this
only
convinced
bud
more
than
ever
that
she
was
a
superior
being
if
she
had
slighted
him
a
bit
so
as
to
awaken
his
combativeness
his
bashfulness
might
have
disappeared
it
was
in
vain
that
martha
inquired
about
his
arm
and
complimented
his
courage
bud
could
only
think
of
his
big
feet
his
clumsy
hands
and
his
slow
tongue
he
answered
in
monosyllables
using
his
red
silk
handkerchief
diligently
is
your
arm
improving
asked
miss
hawkins
yes
i
think
it
is
said
bud
hastily
crossing
his
right
leg
over
his
left
and
trying
to
get
his
fists
out
of
sight
have
you
heard
from
mr
pearson
no
i
answered
bud
removing
his
right
foot
to
the
floor
again
because
it
looked
so
big
and
trying
to
push
his
left
hand
into
his
pocket
beautiful
sunshine
is
it
said
martha
yes
is
answered
bud
sticking
his
right
foot
up
on
the
rung
of
the
chair
and
putting
his
right
hand
behind
him
this
snow
looks
like
the
snow
we
have
at
the
east
said
martha
it
snowed
that
way
the
time
i
was
to
bosting
did
it
said
bud
not
thinking
of
the
snow
at
all
nor
of
boston
but
thinking
how
much
better
he
would
have
appeared
had
he
left
his
arms
and
legs
at
home
i
suppose
hartsook
rode
your
horse
to
lewisburg
yes
he
did
and
bud
hung
both
hands
at
his
side
you
were
very
kind
this
set
bud
heart
so
that
he
could
not
say
anything
but
he
looked
eloquently
at
miss
hawkins
drew
both
feet
under
the
chair
and
rammed
his
hands
into
his
pockets
then
suddenly
remembering
how
awkward
he
must
look
he
immediately
pulled
his
hands
out
again
and
crossed
his
legs
there
was
a
silence
of
a
few
minutes
during
which
bud
made
up
his
mind
to
do
the
most
desperate
thing
he
could
think
of
to
declare
his
love
and
take
the
consequences
you
see
miss
hawkins
he
began
forgetting
boots
and
fists
in
his
agony
i
thought
as
how
i
come
over
here
and
but
here
his
heart
failed
him
utterly
and
see
you
i
glad
to
see
you
mr
means
and
i
thought
i
tell
you
martha
was
sure
it
was
coming
now
for
bud
was
in
dead
earnest
and
i
thought
i
just
like
to
tell
you
ef
i
only
know
jest
how
to
tell
it
right
here
bud
got
frightened
and
did
not
dare
close
the
sentence
as
he
had
intended
i
thought
as
how
you
might
like
to
know
or
ruther
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
the
that
i
that
we
all
of
us
think
that
i
that
we
are
going
to
have
a
a
chewsday
night
i
real
glad
to
hear
it
said
the
bland
but
disappointed
martha
we
used
to
have
at
the
east
but
miss
martha
could
not
remember
that
they
had
them
to
bosting
hard
as
it
is
for
a
bashful
man
to
talk
it
is
still
more
difficult
for
him
to
close
the
conversation
most
men
like
to
leave
a
favorable
impression
and
a
bashful
man
is
always
waiting
with
the
forlorn
hope
that
some
favorable
turn
in
the
talk
may
let
him
out
without
absolute
discomfiture
and
so
bud
stayed
a
long
time
and
how
he
ever
did
get
away
he
never
could
tell

this
letter
accomplished
its
purpose
the
squire
spectacles
slipped
off
several
times
while
he
read
it
his
wig
had
to
be
adjusted
if
he
had
been
threatened
personally
he
would
not
have
minded
it
so
much
but
the
hay
stacks
were
dearer
to
him
than
the
apple
of
his
glass
eye
the
barn
was
more
precious
than
his
wig
and
those
who
hoped
to
touch
bud
in
a
tender
place
through
this
letter
knew
the
squire
weakness
far
better
than
they
knew
the
to
see
his
new
red
barn
with
its
large
mormon
inside
and
the
mounted
indian
on
the
vane
consumed
was
too
much
for
the
hawkins
heart
to
stand
evidently
the
danger
was
on
the
side
of
his
niece
but
how
should
he
influence
martha
to
give
up
bud
martha
did
not
value
the
half
so
highly
as
she
did
her
lover
martha
did
not
think
the
new
red
barn
with
the
great
mormon
press
inside
and
the
galloping
indian
on
the
vane
worth
half
so
much
as
a
moral
principle
or
a
action
martha
bless
her
would
have
sacrificed
anything
rather
than
forsake
the
poor
but
squire
hawkins
lips
shut
tight
over
his
false
teeth
in
a
way
that
suggested
astringent
and
squire
hawkins
could
not
sleep
at
night
if
the
new
red
barn
with
the
galloping
indian
on
the
vane
were
in
danger
martha
must
be
reached
somehow
so
with
many
adjustings
of
that
most
adjustable
wig
with
many
turnings
of
that
reversible
glass
eye
the
squire
managed
to
frighten
martha
by
the
intimation
that
he
had
been
threatened
and
to
make
her
understand
what
it
cost
her
much
to
understand
that
she
must
turn
the
cold
shoulder
to
chivalrous
awkward
bud
whom
she
loved
most
tenderly
partly
perhaps
because
he
did
not
remind
her
of
anybody
she
had
ever
known
at
the
east
tuesday
evening
was
the
fatal
time
was
the
fatal
occasion
bud
was
the
victim
pete
jones
had
his
revenge
for
bud
had
been
all
the
evening
trying
to
muster
courage
enough
to
offer
himself
as
martha
escort
he
was
not
encouraged
by
the
fact
that
he
had
spelled
even
worse
than
usual
while
martha
had
distinguished
herself
by
holding
her
ground
against
jeems
phillips
for
half
an
hour
but
he
screwed
his
courage
to
the
sticking
place
not
by
quoting
to
himself
the
adage
faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
which
indeed
he
had
never
heard
but
by
reminding
himself
that
ef
you
do
resk
notin
you
never
git
nothin
so
when
the
had
adjourned
he
sidled
up
to
her
and
looking
dreadfully
solemn
and
a
little
foolish
he
said
kin
i
see
you
safe
home
and
she
with
a
feeling
that
her
uncle
life
was
in
danger
and
that
his
salvation
depended
upon
her
resolution
she
with
a
feeling
that
she
was
pronouncing
sentence
of
death
on
her
own
great
hope
answered
huskily
no
i
thank
you
if
she
had
only
known
that
it
was
the
red
barn
with
the
indian
on
top
that
was
in
danger
she
would
probably
have
let
the
galloping
brave
take
care
of
himself
it
seemed
to
bud
as
he
walked
home
mortified
disgraced
disappointed
hopeless
that
all
the
world
had
gone
down
in
a
whirlpool
of
despair
might
a
knowed
it
he
said
to
himself
of
course
a
smart

like

small
silent

assiduous
small
set
himself
to
work
to
bind
up
the
wounded
heart
of
bud
means
even
as
he
had
bound
up
his
broken
arm
the
flattery
of
his
fine
eyes
which
looked
at
bud
muscles
so
admiringly
which
gave
attention
to
his
lightest
remark
was
not
lost
on
the
young
flat
creek
hercules
outwardly
at
least
pete
jones
showed
no
inclination
to
revenge
himself
on
bud
was
it
respect
for
muscle
or
was
it
the
influence
of
small
at
any
rate
the
concentrated
extract
of
the
resentment
of
pete
jones
and
his
clique
was
now
ready
to
empty
itself
upon
the
head
of
hartsook
and
ralph
found
himself
in
his
dire
extremity
without
even
the
support
of
bud
whose
good
resolutions
seemed
to
give
way
all
at
once
there
have
been
many
men
of
culture
and
more
favorable
surroundings
who
have
thrown
themselves
away
with
less
provocation
as
it
was
bud
quit
school
avoided
ralph
and
seemed
more
than
ever
under
the
influence
of
small
besides
becoming
the
intimate
of
walter
johnson
small
student
and
matilda
son
they
made
a
strange
pair
bud
with
his
firm
jaw
and
silent
cautious
manner
and
walter
johnson
with
his
weak
chin
his
nice
and
general
dandy
appearance
to
be
thus
deserted
in
his
darkest
hour
by
his
only
friend
was
the
bitterest
ingredient
in
ralph
cup
in
vain
he
sought
an
interview
bud
always
eluded
him
while
by
all
the
faces
about
him
ralph
learned
that
the
storm
was
getting
nearer
and
nearer
to
himself
it
might
delay
if
it
had
been
pete
jones
alone
it
might
blow
over
but
ralph
felt
sure
that
the
relentless
hand
of
small
was
present
in
all
his
troubles
and
he
had
only
to
look
into
small
eye
to
know
how
inextinguishable
was
a
malignity
that
burned
so
steadily
and
so
quietly
but
there
is
no
cup
of
unmixed
bitterness
with
an
innocent
man
there
is
no
night
so
dark
that
some
star
does
not
shine
ralph
had
one
strong
on
his
return
from
lewisburg
on
monday
bud
had
handed
him
a
note
written
on
common
blue
foolscap
in
round
hand
it
ran
dear
sir
anybody
who
can
do
so
good
a
thing
as
you
did
for
our
shocky
can
not
be
bad
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
all
the
appearances
in
the
world
and
all
that
anybody
says
can
not
make
me
think
you
anything
else
but
a
good
man
i
hope
god
will
reward
you
you
must
not
answer
this
and
you
had
better
see
me
again
or
think
any
more
of
what
you
spoke
about
the
other
night
i
shall
be
a
slave
for
three
years
more
and
then
i
must
work
for
my
mother
and
shocky
but
i
felt
so
bad
to
think
that
i
had
spoken
so
hard
to
you
that
i
could
not
help
writing
this
respectfully
hannah
thomson
to
hartsook
esq
ralph
read
it
over
and
over
what
else
he
did
with
it
i
shall
not
tell
you
want
to
know
whether
he
kissed
it
and
put
it
into
his
bosom
many
a
man
as
intelligent
and
manly
as
hartsook
has
done
quite
as
foolish
a
thing
as
that
you
have
been
a
little
silly
perhaps
if
it
is
silly
and
you
have
acted
in
a
sentimental
sort
of
a
way
over
such
things
but
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
tell
you
what
ralph
did
whether
he
put
the
letter
into
his
bosom
or
not
he
put
the
words
into
his
heart
and
metaphorically
speaking
he
shook
that
little
blue
billet
written
on
coarse
foolscap
paper
he
shook
that
little
letter
full
of
confidence
in
the
face
and
eyes
of
all
the
calamities
that
haunted
him
if
hannah
believed
in
him
the
whole
world
might
distrust
him
when
hannah
was
in
one
scale
and
the
whole
world
in
the
other
of
what
account
was
the
world
justice
may
be
blind
but
all
the
pictures
of
blind
cupids
in
the
world
can
not
make
love
blind
and
it
was
well
that
ralph
weighed
things
in
this
way
for
the
time
was
come
in
which
he
needed
all
the
courage
the
blue
billet
could
give
him
chapter
xxviii
the
flight
about
ten
days
after
ralph
return
to
flat
creek
things
came
to
a
crisis
the
master
was
rather
relieved
at
first
to
have
the
crisis
come
he
had
been
holding
juvenile
flat
creek
under
his
feet
by
sheer
force
of
will
and
such
an
exercise
of
psychic
power
is
very
exhausting
in
racing
on
the
ohio
the
engineer
sometimes
sends
the
largest
of
the
firemen
to
hold
the
safety
valve
down
and
this
he
does
by
hanging
himself
to
the
lever
by
his
hands
ralph
felt
that
he
had
been
holding
the
down
and
that
he
was
so
weary
of
the
operation
that
an
explosion
would
be
a
real
relief
he
was
a
little
tired
of
having
everybody
look
on
him
as
a
thief
it
was
a
little
irksome
to
know
that
new
bolts
were
put
on
the
doors
of
the
houses
in
which
he
had
staid
and
now
that
shocky
was
gone
and
bud
had
turned
against
him
and
aunt
matilda
suspected
him
and
even
poor
weak
exquisite
walter
johnson
would
not
associate
with
him
he
felt
himself
an
outlaw
indeed
he
would
have
gone
away
to
texas
or
the
new
gold
fields
in
california
had
it
not
been
for
one
thing
that
letter
on
blue
foolscap
paper
kept
a
little
warmth
in
his
heart
his
course
from
school
on
the
evening
that
something
happened
lay
through
the
among
the
dark
trunks
of
the
maples
solemn
and
lofty
pillars
he
debated
the
case
to
stay
or
to
flee
the
worn
nerves
could
not
keep
their
present
tension
much
longer
it
was
just
by
the
brook
or
as
they
say
in
indiana
the
branch
that
something
happened
which
brought
him
to
a
sudden
decision
ralph
never
afterward
could
forget
that
brook
it
was
a
little
stream
that
did
not
babble
blatantly
over
the
stones
it
ran
through
a
thicket
of
willows
through
the
and
out
into
pasture
ralph
had
just
passed
through
the
thicket
had
just
crossed
the
brook
on
the
log
that
spanned
it
when
as
he
emerged
from
the
on
the
other
side
he
started
with
a
sudden
shock
for
there
was
hannah
with
a
white
white
face
holding
out
a
little
note
folded
like
an
go
quick
she
stammered
as
she
slipped
it
into
ralph
hand
inadvertently
touching
his
fingers
with
her
own
a
touch
that
went
tingling
through
the
nerves
but
she
had
hardly
said
the
words
until
she
was
gone
down
the
brookside
path
and
over
into
the
pasture
a
few
minutes
afterward
she
drove
the
cows
up
into
the
lot
and
meekly
took
her
scolding
from
means
for
being
gone
sech
an
awful
long
time
like
a
lazy
piece
of
goods
that
she
was
ralph
opened
the
note
written
on
a
page
torn
from
an
old
in
bud
and
running
heartsook
deer
sur
i
put
in
my
best
licks
taint
no
use
run
fer
yore
life
a
plans
on
foot
to
tar
an
fether
or
wuss
go
rite
off
things
is
awful
juberous
bud
the
first
question
with
ralph
was
whether
he
could
depend
on
bud
but
he
soon
made
up
his
mind
that
treachery
of
any
sort
was
not
one
of
his
traits
he
had
mourned
over
the
destruction
of
bud
good
resolutions
by
martha
hawkins
refusal
and
being
a
disinterested
party
he
could
have
comforted
bud
by
explaining
martha
mitten
but
he
felt
sure
that
bud
was
not
treacherous
it
was
a
relief
then
as
he
stood
there
to
know
that
the
false
truce
was
over
and
worst
had
come
to
worst
his
first
impulse
was
to
stay
and
fight
but
his
nerves
were
not
strong
enough
to
execute
so
foolhardy
a
resolution
he
seemed
to
see
a
man
behind
every
darkness
was
fast
coming
on
and
he
knew
that
his
absence
from
supper
at
his
could
not
fail
to
excite
suspicion
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
so
he
started
once
run
from
a
danger
and
panic
is
apt
to
ensue
the
forest
the
the
dark
hollows
through
which
he
passed
seemed
to
be
peopled
with
terrors
he
knew
small
and
jones
well
enough
to
know
that
every
avenue
of
escape
would
be
carefully
picketed
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
the
shortest
path
to
the
old
trysting
place
the
here
he
sat
and
shook
with
terror
angry
with
himself
he
inly
denounced
himself
for
a
coward
but
the
effect
was
really
a
physical
one
the
chill
and
panic
now
were
the
reaction
from
the
previous
strain
for
when
the
sound
of
his
pursuers
voices
broke
upon
his
ears
early
in
the
evening
ralph
shook
no
more
the
warm
blood
set
back
again
toward
the
extremities
and
his
returned
when
he
needed
it
he
gathered
some
stones
about
him
as
the
only
weapons
of
defense
at
hand
the
mob
was
on
the
cliff
above
but
he
thought
that
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
bed
of
the
creek
below
if
this
were
so
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
his
was
suspected
o
hank
shouted
bud
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
to
some
one
in
the
creek
below
be
sure
to
look
at
the
i
think
he
there
this
hint
was
not
lost
on
ralph
who
speedily
changed
his
quarters
by
climbing
up
to
a
secluded
ledge
above
the
spring
he
was
none
too
soon
for
pete
jones
and
hank
banta
were
soon
looking
all
around
the
spring
for
him
while
he
held
a
stone
over
their
heads
ready
to
drop
upon
them
in
case
they
should
think
of
looking
on
the
ledge
above
when
the
crowd
were
gone
ralph
knew
that
one
road
was
open
to
him
he
could
follow
down
the
creek
to
clifty
and
thence
he
might
escape
but
traveling
down
to
clifty
he
debated
whether
it
was
best
to
escape
to
flee
was
to
confess
his
guilt
to
make
himself
an
outlaw
to
put
an
insurmountable
barrier
between
himself
and
hannah
whose
and
anxious
face
as
she
stood
by
the
haunted
him
now
and
was
an
involuntary
witness
to
her
love
long
before
he
reached
clifty
his
mind
was
made
up
not
to
flee
another
mile
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
squire
underwood
but
squire
underwood
was
also
a
doctor
and
had
been
called
away
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
squire
doolittle
but
squire
doolittle
had
gone
to
lewisburg
he
was
about
to
give
up
all
hope
of
being
able
to
surrender
himself
to
the
law
when
he
met
squire
hawkins
who
had
come
over
to
clifty
to
avoid
responsibility
for
the
of
his
neighbors
which
he
was
powerless
to
prevent
is
that
you
mr
hartsook

and
i
want
you
to
arrest
me

chapter
xxix
the
trial
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
so
the
state
attorney
is
called
in
indiana
had
been
sent
for
the
night
before
ralph
refused
all
legal
help
it
was
not
wise
to
reject
counsel
but
all
his
blood
was
up
and
he
declared
that
he
would
not
be
cleared
by
legal
quibbles
if
his
innocence
were
not
made
evident
to
everybody
he
would
rather
not
be
acquitted
on
a
preliminary
examination
he
would
go
over
to
the
circuit
court
and
have
the
matter
sifted
to
the
bottom
but
he
would
have
been
pleased
had
his
uncle
offered
his
counsel
though
he
would
have
declined
it
he
would
have
felt
better
to
have
had
a
letter
from
home
somewhat
different
from
the
one
he
received
from
his
aunt
matilda
by
the
hand
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
it
was
not
very
encouraging
or
very
sympathetic
though
it
was
very
characteristic
dear
ralph
this
is
what
i
have
always
been
afraid
of
i
warned
you
faithfully
the
last
time
i
saw
you
my
skirts
are
clear
of
your
blood
i
can
not
consent
for
your
uncle
to
appear
as
your
counsel
or
to
go
your
bail
you
know
how
much
it
would
injure
him
in
the
county
and
he
has
no
right
to
suffer
for
your
evil
acts
o
my
dear
nephew
for
the
sake
of
your
poor
dead
mother
we
never
shall
know
what
the
rest
of
that
letter
was
whenever
aunt
matilda
got
to
ralph
poor
dead
mother
in
her
conversation
ralph
ran
out
of
the
house
and
now
that
his
poor
dead
mother
was
again
made
to
do
service
in
his
aunt
pious
rhetoric
he
landed
the
letter
on
the
hot
coals
before
him
and
watched
it
vanish
into
smoke
with
a
grim
satisfaction
ralph
was
a
little
afraid
of
a
mob
but
clifty
was
better
than
flat
creek
and
squire
hawkins
with
all
his
faults
loved
justice
and
had
a
profound
respect
for
the
majesty
of
the
law
and
a
profound
respect
for
his
own
majesty
when
sitting
as
a
court
representing
the
law
whatever
maneuvers
he
might
resort
to
in
business
affairs
in
order
to
avoid
a
conflict
with
his
lawless
neighbors
he
was
courageous
and
inflexible
on
the
bench
the
squire
was
the
better
part
of
him
with
the
of
the
constable
he
had
organized
a
of
men
who
could
be
depended
on
to
enforce
the
law
against
a
mob
by
the
time
the
trial
opened
in
the
large
in
clifty
at
eleven
all
the
surrounding
country
had
emptied
its
population
into
clifty
and
all
flat
creek
was
on
hand
ready
to
testify
to
something
those
who
knew
the
least
appeared
to
know
the
most
and
were
prodigal
of
their
significant
winks
and
nods
means
had
always
suspected
him
she
seed
some
mighty
suspicious
things
about
him
from
the
word
go
she
allers
had
her
doubts
whether
he
was
jist
the
thing
and
ef
her
ole
man
had
axed
her
not
he
never
a
been
hired
seed
things
with
her
own
livin
eyes
that
beat
all
she
ever
seed
in
all
her
born
days
and
pete
jones
said
he
allers
knowed
ther
war
no
good
in
sech
a
feller
could
stay
abed
when
he
got
there
and
granny
sanders
said
law
sakes
nobody
ever
a
found
him
out
ef
it
been
fer
her
did
she
go
all
over
the
neighborhood
people
fer
her
part
she
seed
straight
through
that
piece
of
goods
he
was
fond
of
the
gals
too
nothing
was
so
great
a
crime
in
her
eyes
as
to
be
fond
of
the
gals
the
constable
paid
unwitting
tribute
to
william
the
conquerer
by
crying
squire
hawkins
court
open
with
an
oyez
or
as
he
said
o
yes
and
the
squire
asked
squire
underwood
who
came
in
at
that
minute
to
sit
with
him
from
the
start
it
was
evident
to
ralph
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
had
been
thoroughly
posted
by
small
though
looking
at
that
worthy
face
one
would
have
thought
him
the
most
disinterested
and
philosophical
spectator
in
the
bronson
the
prosecutor
was
a
young
man
and
this
was
his
first
case
since
his
election
he
was
very
ambitious
to
distinguish
himself
very
anxious
to
have
flat
creek
influence
on
his
side
in
politics
and
consequently
he
was
very
determined
to
send
ralph
hartsook
to
state
prison
justly
or
unjustly
by
fair
means
or
foul
to
his
professional
eyes
this
was
not
a
question
of
right
and
wrong
not
a
question
of
life
or
death
to
such
a
man
as
ralph
it
was
george
bronson
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
and
so
with
many
knowing
and
confident
nods
and
hints
and
with
much
deference
to
the
two
squires
he
opened
the
case
affecting
great
indignation
at
ralph
wickedness
and
uttering
delphic
hints
about
striped
pants
and
shaven
head
and
the
grating
of
at
jeffersonville
and
now
if
the
court
please
i
am
about
to
call
a
witness
whose
testimony
is
very
important
indeed
sarah
jane
means
will
please
step
forward
and
be
sworn
this
means
did
with
alacrity
she
had
met
the
prosecutor
and
impressed
him
with
her
dark
hints
she
was
sworn
now
means
have
the
goodness
to
tell
us
what
you
know
of
the
robbery
at
the
house
of
peter
schroeder
and
the
part
defendant
had
in
it
well
you
see
i
allers
suspected
that
air
young
man
here
squire
underwood
stopped
her
and
told
her
that
she
must
not
tell
her
suspicions
but
facts
well
it
facts
i
am
to
tell
she
sniffed
indignantly
facts
that
i
mean
to
tell
here
her
voice
rose
to
a
keen
pitch
and
she
began
to
abuse
the
defendant
again
and
again
the
court
insisted
that
she
must
tell
what
there
was
suspicious
about
the
at
last
she
got
it
out
well
fer
one
thing
what
kind
of
gals
did
he
go
with
hey
why
with
my
bound
gal
hanner
along
through
the
paster
at
ten
and
keepin
that
gal
that
got
no
protector
but
me
out
that
and
destroyin
her
character
by
his
company
that
fit
fer
nobody
here
bronson
saw
that
he
had
caught
a
tartar
he
said
he
had
no
more
questions
to
ask
of
means
and
that
unless
the
defendant
wished
to
her
she
could
stand
aside
ralph
said
he
would
like
to
ask
her
one
question
did
i
ever
go
with
your
daughter
miranda
no
you
did
answered
the
witness
with
a
tone
and
a
toss
of
the
head
that
let
the
cat
out
and
set
the
in
a
giggle
bronson
saw
that
he
was
gaining
nothing
and
now
resolved
to
follow
the
line
which
small
had
indicated
pete
jones
was
called
and
swore
that
he
heard
ralph
go
out
of
the
house
soon
after
he
went
to
bed
and
that
he
heard
him
return
at
two
in
the
morning
this
testimony
was
given
without
hesitation
and
made
a
great
impression
against
ralph
in
the
minds
of
the
justices
jones
a
poor
woman
came
on
the
stand
in
a
frightened
way
and
swore
to
the
same
lies
as
her
husband
ralph
her
but
her
part
had
been
well
learned
there
seemed
now
little
hope
for
ralph
but
just
at
this
moment
who
should
stride
into
the
but
pearson
the
old
soldier
he
had
crept
home
the
night
before
to
see
ef
the
ole
woman
did
want
somethin
and
hearing
of
ralph
arrest
he
concluded
that
the
time
for
him
to
make
a
forrard
movement
had
come
and
so
he
determined
to
face
the
foe
looky
here
squar
he
said
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
looky
here
i
jes
want
to
say
that
i
kin
tell
as
much
about
this
case
as
anybody
let
us
hear
it
then
said
bronson
who
thought
he
would
nail
ralph
now
for
certain
so
with
many
allusions
to
the
time
he
fit
at
lundy
lane
and
some
indignant
remarks
about
the
pack
of
thieves
that
driv
him
off
and
a
passing
tribute
to
miss
martha
hawkins
and
sundry
other
digressions
in
which
he
had
to
be
checked
the
old
man
told
how
he
drunk
whisky
at
welch
store
that
night
and
how
welch
whisky
was
mean
and
how
it
allers
went
straight
to
his
head
and
how
he
had
got
a
leetle
too
much
and
how
he
had
felt
kyinder
gin
aout
by
the
time
he
got
to
the
blacksmith
shop
and
how
he
had
laid
down
to
rest
and
how
as
he
the
boys
had
crated
him
and
how
he
thought
it
war
mean
to
crate
a
old
soldier
what
fit
the
britishers
and
lost
his
leg
by
one
of
the
blamed
critters
his
bagonet
through
it
and
how
when
he
woke
up
it
was
cold
and
how
he
rolled
off
the
crate
and
went
on
home
and
how
when
he
got
up
to
the
top
of
means
hill
he
met
pete
jones
and
bill
jones
and
a
slim
sort
of
a
young
man
and
how
he
know
the
joneses
by
ther
hosses
and
some
more
things
of
that
kyind
about
but
he
did
know
the
slim
young
man
tho
he
he
might
tell
him
ef
he
seed
him
agin
kase
he
was
dressed
up
so
slick
and
but
blamed
ef
he
did
think
it
hard
that
a
passel
o
thieves
sech
as
the
joneses
should
try
to
put
ther
mean
things
on
to
a
man
like
the
master
that
was
so
kyind
to
him
and
to
shocky
tho
fer
that
matter
blamed
ef
he
did
think
we
was
all
selfish
akordin
to
his
tell
had
seed
somebody
that
night
over
the
paster
did
know
who
in
thunder
was
but
it
was
somebody
straight
fer
pete
jones
had
seed
nobody
else
small
a
short
ways
behind
the
joneses
hannah
was
now
brought
on
the
stand
she
was
greatly
agitated
and
answered
with
much
reluctance
lived
at
means
was
eighteen
years
of
age
in
october
had
been
bound
to
means
three
years
ago
had
walked
home
with
hartsook
that
evening
and
happening
to
look
out
of
the
window
toward
morning
she
saw
some
one
cross
the
pasture
did
not
know
who
it
was
thought
it
was
hartsook
here
bronson
evidently
prompted
by
a
suggestion
that
came
from
what
small
had
overheard
when
he
listened
in
the
barn
asked
her
if
hartsook
had
ever
said
anything
to
her
about
the
matter
afterward
after
some
hesitation
hannah
said
that
he
had
said
that
he
crossed
the
pasture
of
his
own
accord
no
she
spoke
of
it
first
had
hartsook
offered
any
explanations
no
he
had
had
he
ever
paid
her
any
attention
afterward
no
ralph
declined
to
hannah
to
him
she
never
seemed
so
fair
as
when
telling
the
truth
so
sublimely
bronson
now
informed
the
court
that
this
little
trick
of
having
the
old
soldier
happen
in
in
the
flick
of
time
would
save
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
from
the
just
punishment
which
an
outraged
law
visited
upon
such
crimes
as
his
he
regretted
that
his
duty
as
a
public
prosecutor
caused
it
to
fall
to
his
lot
to
marshal
the
evidence
that
was
to
blight
the
prospects
and
blast
the
character
and
annihilate
for
ever
so
able
and
promising
a
young
man
but
that
the
law
knew
no
difference
between
the
educated
and
the
uneducated
and
that
for
his
part
he
thought
hartsook
a
most
dangerous
foe
to
the
peace
of
society
the
evidence
already
given
fastened
suspicion
upon
him
the
prisoner
had
not
yet
been
able
to
break
its
force
at
all
the
prisoner
had
not
even
dared
to
try
to
explain
to
a
young
lady
the
reason
for
his
being
out
at
night
he
would
now
conclude
by
giving
the
last
touch
to
the
dark
evidence
that
would
sink
the
once
fair
name
of
ralph
hartsook
in
a
hundred
fathoms
of
infamy
he
would
ask
that
henry
banta
be
called
hank
came
forward
sheepishly
and
was
sworn
lived
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
house
that
was
robbed
he
seen
ole
man
pearson
and
the
master
and
one
other
feller
that
he
did
know
come
away
from
there
together
about
one
he
heerd
the
horses
kickin
and
went
out
to
the
stable
to
see
about
them
he
seed
two
men
come
out
of
schroeder
back
door
and
meet
one
man
standing
at
the
gate
when
they
got
closter
he
knowed
pearson
by
his
wooden
leg
and
the
master
by
his
hat
on
he
was
a
little
confused
when
asked
why
he
had
told
of
it
before
but
said
that
he
was
afraid
to
say
much
bekase
the
folks
was
about
hanging
the
master
and
he
did
want
no
lynchin
the
prosecution
here
rested
bronson
maintaining
that
there
was
enough
evidence
to
justify
ralph
committal
to
await
trial
but
the
court
thought
that
as
the
defendant
had
no
counsel
and
offered
no
rebutting
testimony
it
would
be
only
fair
to
hear
what
the
prisoner
had
to
say
in
his
own
defense
all
this
while
poor
ralph
was
looking
about
the
room
for
bud
actions
had
of
late
been
strangely
contradictory
but
had
he
turned
coward
and
deserted
his
friend
why
else
did
he
avoid
the
session
of
the
court
after
asking
himself
such
questions
as
these
ralph
would
wonder
at
his
own
folly
what
could
bud
do
if
he
were
there
there
was
no
human
power
that
could
prevent
the
victim
of
so
vile
a
conspiracy
as
this
lodging
in
that
worst
of
state
prisons
at
jeffersonville
a
place
too
bad
for
criminals
but
when
there
is
no
human
power
to
help
how
naturally
does
the
human
mind
look
for
some
divine
intervention
on
the
side
of
right
and
ralph
faith
in
providence
looked
in
the
direction
of
bud
but
since
no
bud
came
he
shut
down
the
valves
and
rose
to
his
feet
proudly
defiantly
fiercely
calm
it
of
no
use
for
me
to
say
anything
peter
jones
has
sworn
to
a
deliberate
falsehood
and
he
knows
it
he
has
made
his
wife
perjure
her
poor
soul
that
she
dare
not
call
her
own
here
pete
fists
clenched
but
ralph
in
his
present
humor
did
not
care
for
mobs
the
spirit
of
the
bulldog
had
complete
possession
of
him
it
is
of
no
use
for
me
to
tell
you
that
henry
banta
has
sworn
to
a
lie
partly
to
revenge
himself
on
me
for
punishments
i
have
given
him
and
partly
perhaps
for
money
the
real
thieves
are
in
this
i
could
put
my
finger
on
them
be
sure
responded
the
old
ralph
looked
at
pete
jones
then
at
small
the
fiercely
calm
look
attracted
the
attention
of
the
people
he
knew
that
this
look
would
probably
cost
him
his
life
before
the
next
morning
but
he
did
not
care
for
life
the
testimony
of
miss
hannah
thomson
is
every
word
true
i
believe
that
of
pearson
to
be
true
the
rest
is
false
but
i
can
not
prove
it
i
know
the
men
i
have
to
deal
with
i
shall
not
escape
with
state
prison
they
will
not
spare
my
life
but
the
people
of
clifty
will
one
day
find
out
who
are
the
thieves
ralph
then
proceeded
to
tell
how
he
had
left
pete
jones
jones
bed
being
uncomfortable
how
he
had
walked
through
the
pasture
how
he
had
seen
three
men
on
horseback
how
he
had
noticed
the
sorrel
with
the
white
left
forefoot
and
white
nose
how
he
had
seen
small
how
after
his
return
he
had
heard
some
one
enter
the
house
and
how
he
had
recognized
the
horse
the
next
morning
there
said
ralph
desperately
leveling
his
finger
at
pete
there
is
a
man
who
will
yet
see
the
inside
of
a
penitentiary
i
shall
not
live
to
see
it
but
the
rest
of
you
will
pete
quailed
ralph
speech
could
not
of
course
break
the
force
of
the
testimony
against
him
but
it
had
its
effect
and
it
had
effect
enough
to
alarm
bronson
who
rose
and
said
i
should
like
to
ask
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
one
question
ask
me
a
dozen
said
hartsook
looking
more
like
a
king
than
a
criminal
well
then
hartsook
you
need
not
answer
unless
you
choose
but
what
prompted
you
to
take
the
direction
you
did
in
your
walk
on
that
evening
this
shot
brought
ralph
down
to
answer
this
question
truly
would
attach
to
friendless
hannah
thomson
some
of
the
disgrace
that
now
belonged
to
him
i
decline
to
answer
said
ralph
of
course
i
do
not
want
the
prisoner
to
criminate
himself
said
bronson
significantly
during
this
last
passage
bud
had
come
in
but
to
ralph
disappointment
he
remained
near
the
door
talking
to
walter
johnson
who
had
come
with
him
the
magistrates
put
their
heads
together
to
fix
the
amount
of
bail
and
as
they
differed
talked
for
some
minutes
small
now
for
the
first
time
thought
best
to
make
a
move
in
his
own
proper
person
he
could
hardly
have
been
afraid
of
ralph
acquittal
he
may
have
been
a
little
anxious
at
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
mentioned
and
at
the
significant
look
of
ralph
and
he
probably
meant
to
excite
indignation
enough
against
the
to
break
the
force
of
his
speech
and
secure
the
lynching
of
the
prisoner
chiefly
by
people
outside
his
gang
he
rose
and
asked
the
court
in
gentlest
tones
to
hear
him
he
had
no
personal
interest
in
this
trial
except
his
interest
in
the
welfare
of
his
old
schoolmate
hartsook
he
was
grieved
and
disappointed
to
find
the
evidence
against
him
so
damaging
and
he
would
not
for
the
world
add
a
feather
to
it
if
it
were
not
that
his
own
name
had
been
twice
alluded
to
by
the
defendant
and
by
his
friend
and
perhaps
his
confederate
john
pearson
he
was
prepared
to
swear
that
he
was
not
over
in
flat
creek
the
night
of
the
robbery
later
than
ten
and
while
the
statements
of
the
two
persons
alluded
to
whether
maliciously
intended
or
not
could
not
implicate
him
at
all
he
thought
perhaps
this
lack
of
veracity
in
their
statements
might
be
of
weight
in
determining
some
other
points
he
therefore
suggested
he
could
only
suggest
as
he
was
not
a
party
to
the
case
in
any
way
that
his
student
walter
johnson
be
called
to
testify
as
to
his
small
exact
whereabouts
on
the
night
in
question
they
were
together
in
his
office
until
two
when
he
went
to
the
tavern
and
went
to
bed
squire
hawkins
having
adjusted
his
teeth
his
wig
and
his
glass
eye
thanked
small
for
a
suggestion
so
valuable
and
thought
best
to
put
john
pearson
under
arrest
before
proceeding
further
pearson
was
therefore
arrested
and
was
heard
to
mutter
something
about
a
passel
of
thieves
when
the
court
warned
him
to
be
quiet
walter
johnson
was
then
called
but
before
giving
his
testimony
i
must
crave
the
reader
patience
while
i
go
back
to
some
things
which
happened
nearly
a
week
before
and
which
will
serve
to
make
it
intelligible
footnotes
footnote
this
form
is
not
in
the
vocabularies
but
it
was
spoken
as
i
have
written
it
the
century
dictionary
gives
and
halliwell
and
wright
both
give
with
the
soft
apparently
though
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
is
very
explicit
in
distinguishing
transcriptions
from
old
authors
from
phonetic
spellings
of
dialect
forms
i
fancy
that
this
is
impossible
as
a
corruption
of
and
that
it
points
to
some
other
derivation
of
that
word
than
the
doubtful
one
from
chapter
xxx
brother
sodom
in
order
to
explain
walter
johnson
testimony
and
his
state
of
mind
i
must
carry
the
reader
back
nearly
a
week
the
scene
was
office
bud
and
walter
johnson
had
been
having
some
confidential
conversation
that
evening
and
bud
had
got
more
out
of
his
companion
than
that
exquisite
but
weak
young
man
had
intended
he
looked
round
in
a
frightened
way
you
see
said
walter
if
small
knew
i
had
told
you
that
i
get
a
bullet
some
night
from
somebody
but
when
you
initiated
it
be
all
right
sometimes
i
wish
i
was
out
of
it
but
you
know
small
this
kind
of
a
man
he
sees
through
you
he
can
look
through
a
door
and
there
he
shivered
and
his
voice
broke
down
into
a
whisper
but
bud
was
perfectly
cool
and
doubtless
it
was
the
strong
coolness
of
bud
that
made
walter
who
shuddered
at
a
shadow
come
to
him
for
sympathy
and
unbosom
himself
of
one
of
his
guilty
secrets
let
go
and
hear
brother
sodom
preach
said
bud
no
i
do
like
to
he
do
scare
you
there
was
just
a
touch
of
ridicule
in
bud
voice
he
knew
walter
and
he
had
not
counted
amiss
when
he
used
this
little
goad
to
prick
a
skin
so
sensitive
brother
sodom
was
the
nickname
given
by
scoffers
to
the
preacher
soden
whose
manner
of
preaching
had
so
aroused
bud
combativeness
and
whose
bud
had
helped
to
amputate
for
reasons
of
his
own
bud
thought
best
to
subject
young
johnson
to
the
heat
of
soden
furnace
peter
cartwright
boasts
that
on
a
certain
occasion
he
shook
his
brimstone
wallet
over
the
people
soden
could
never
preach
without
his
brimstone
wallet
there
are
those
of
refinement
so
attenuated
that
they
will
not
admit
that
fear
can
have
any
place
in
religion
but
a
religion
without
fear
could
never
have
evangelized
or
civilized
the
west
which
at
one
time
bade
fair
to
become
a
perdition
as
bad
as
any
that
brother
sodom
ever
depicted
and
against
these
on
the
one
side
and
the
brother
sodoms
on
the
other
i
shall
interrupt
my
story
to
put
this
chapter
under
shelter
of
that
wise
remark
of
the
great
adam
clark
who
says
the
fear
of
god
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
the
terror
of
god
confounds
the
soul
and
that
other
saying
of
his
with
the
of
god
the
love
of
god
is
ever
consistent
but
where
the
of
the
lord
reigns
there
can
neither
be
nor
nay
nor
either
and
yet
i
am
not
sure
that
even
the
brother
sodoms
were
made
in
vain
on
this
evening
soden
was
as
terrible
as
usual
bud
heard
him
without
flinching
small
who
sat
farther
forward
listened
with
pious
approval
soden
out
of
distorted
figures
pieced
together
from
different
passages
of
scripture
built
a
hell
not
quite
miltonic
nor
yet
dantean
but
as
miltonic
and
dantean
as
his
unrefined
imagination
could
make
it
as
he
rose
toward
his
climax
of
hideous
description
walter
johnson
trembled
from
head
to
foot
and
sat
close
to
bud
then
as
burly
soden
with
great
gusto
depicted
materialistic
tortures
that
startled
the
nerves
of
everybody
except
bud
walter
wanted
to
leave
but
bud
would
not
let
him
for
some
reason
he
wished
to
keep
his
companion
in
the
crucible
as
long
as
possible
young
man
cried
soden
and
the
explosive
voice
seemed
to
come
from
the
hell
that
he
had
created
young
man
you
who
have
followed
the
counsel
of
evil
companions
here
he
paused
and
looked
about
as
if
trying
to
find
the
man
he
wanted
while
walter
crept
up
close
to
bud
and
shaded
his
face
i
mean
you
who
have
chosen
evil
pursuits
and
who
can
not
get
free
from
bad
habits
and
associations
that
are
dragging
you
down
to
hell
you
are
standing
on
the
very
crumbling
brink
of
hell
the
smell
of
the
brimstone
is
on
your
garments
the
hot
breath
of
hell
is
in
your
face
the
devils
are
waiting
for
you
delay
and
you
are
damned
you
may
die
before
daylight
you
may
never
get
out
that
door
the
awful
angel
of
death
is
just
ready
to
strike
you
down
here
some
shrieked
with
terror
others
sobbed
and
brother
sodom
looked
with
approval
on
the
storm
he
had
awakened
the
very
harshness
of
his
tone
his
lofty
egotism
of
manner
that
which
had
roused
all
combativeness
shook
poor
walter
as
a
wind
would
shake
a
reed
in
the
midst
of
the
general
excitement
he
seized
his
hat
and
hastened
out
the
door
bud
followed
while
soden
shot
his
lightnings
after
them
declaring
that
young
men
who
ran
away
from
the
truth
would
dwell
in
torments
forever
bud
had
not
counted
amiss
when
he
thought
that
soden
preaching
would
be
likely
to
arouse
so
a
fellow
as
walter
so
vivid
was
the
impression
that
johnson
begged
bud
to
return
to
the
office
with
him
he
felt
sick
and
was
afraid
that
he
should
die
before
morning
he
insisted
that
bud
should
stay
with
him
all
night
to
this
means
readily
consented
and
by
morning
he
had
heard
all
that
the
frightened
walter
had
to
tell
and
now
let
us
return
to
the
trial
where
ralph
sits
waiting
the
testimony
of
walter
johnson
which
is
to
prove
his
statement
false
chapter
xxxi
the
trial
concluded
i
do
not
know
how
much
interest
the
gentle
reader
may
feel
in
bud
but
i
venture
to
hope
that
there
are
some
buddhists
among
my
readers
who
will
wish
the
contradictoriness
of
his
actions
explained
the
first
dash
of
disappointment
had
upset
him
and
when
a
man
concludes
to
throw
overboard
his
good
resolutions
he
always
seeks
to
avoid
the
witness
of
those
resolutions
hence
bud
after
that
distressful
tuesday
evening
on
which
miss
martha
had
given
him
the
sack
wished
to
see
ralph
less
than
any
one
else
and
yet
when
he
came
to
suspect
villainy
his
whole
nature
revolted
at
it
but
having
broken
with
ralph
he
thought
it
best
to
maintain
an
attitude
of
apparent
hostility
that
he
might
act
as
a
detective
and
perhaps
save
his
friend
from
the
mischief
that
threatened
him
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
ralph
arrest
he
determined
to
make
walter
johnson
tell
his
own
secret
in
court
because
he
knew
that
it
would
be
best
for
ralph
that
walter
should
tell
it
bud
telling
at
would
not
be
conclusive
and
he
sincerely
desired
to
save
walter
from
prison
for
walter
johnson
was
the
victim
of
small
or
of
small
and
such
novels
as
the
pirate
bride
claude
duval
the
wild
rover
of
the
west
indies
and
the
cheap
biographies
of
such
men
as
murrell
small
found
him
with
his
imagination
inflamed
by
the
history
of
such
heroes
and
opened
to
him
the
path
to
glory
for
which
he
longed
the
whole
morning
after
ralph
arrest
bud
was
working
on
conscience
and
his
fears
the
poor
fellow
unable
to
act
for
himself
was
torn
asunder
between
the
old
ascendency
of
small
and
the
new
ascendency
of
bud
means
bud
finally
frightened
him
by
the
fear
of
the
penitentiary
into
going
to
the
place
of
trial
but
once
inside
the
door
and
once
in
sight
of
small
who
was
more
to
him
than
god
or
rather
more
to
him
than
the
devil
for
the
devil
was
walter
god
or
perhaps
i
should
say
walter
god
was
a
devil
once
in
sight
of
small
he
refused
to
move
an
inch
farther
and
bud
after
all
his
perseverance
was
about
to
give
up
in
sheer
despair
fortunately
just
at
that
moment
small
desire
to
relieve
himself
from
the
taint
of
suspicion
and
to
crush
ralph
as
completely
as
possible
made
him
overshoot
the
mark
by
asking
that
walter
be
called
to
the
stand
as
we
have
before
recounted
he
knew
that
he
had
no
tool
so
supple
as
the
cowardly
walter
in
the
very
language
of
the
request
he
had
given
walter
an
intimation
of
what
he
wanted
him
to
swear
to
walter
listened
to
small
words
as
to
his
doom
he
felt
that
he
should
die
of
indecision
the
perdition
of
a
man
of
his
stamp
is
to
have
to
make
up
his
mind
such
men
generally
fall
back
on
some
one
more
positive
and
take
all
their
resolutions
but
here
walter
must
decide
for
himself
for
the
constable
was
already
calling
his
name
the
court
the
spectators
and
most
of
all
small
were
waiting
for
him
he
moved
forward
mechanically
through
the
dense
crowd
bud
following
part
of
the
way
to
whisper
tell
the
truth
or
go
to
penitentiary
walter
shook
and
shivered
at
this
the
witness
with
difficulty
held
up
his
hand
long
enough
to
be
sworn
please
tell
the
court
said
bronson
whether
you
know
anything
of
the
whereabouts
of
small
on
the
night
of
the
robbery
at
peter
schroeder
small
had
detected
walter
agitation
and
taking
alarm
had
edged
his
way
around
so
as
to
stand
full
in
walter
sight
and
there
with
keen
magnetic
eye
on
the
weak
orbs
of
the
young
man
he
was
able
to
assume
his
old
position
and
sway
the
fellow
absolutely
on
the
night
of
the
robbery
walter
voice
was
weak
but
he
seemed
to
be
reading
his
answer
out
of
small
eyes
on
the
night
of
the
robbery
small
came
home
before
here
the
witness
stopped
and
shook
and
shivered
again
for
bud
detecting
the
effect
of
small
gaze
had
pushed
his
great
hulk
in
front
of
small
and
had
fastened
his
eyes
on
walter
with
a
look
that
said
tell
the
truth
or
go
to
penitentiary
i
ca
i
ca
o
god
what
shall
i
do
the
witness
exclaimed
answering
the
look
of
bud
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
bud
had
spoken
to
the
people
and
the
court
this
agitation
was
inexplicable
squire
hawkins
wig
got
awry
his
glass
eye
turned
in
toward
his
nose
and
he
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
his
teeth
from
falling
out
the
excitement
became
painfully
intense
ralph
was
on
his
feet
looking
at
the
witness
and
feeling
that
somehow
bud
and
small
his
good
angel
and
his
demon
were
playing
an
awful
game
or
which
he
was
the
stake
the
crowd
swayed
to
and
fro
but
remained
utterly
silent
waiting
to
hear
the
least
whisper
from
the
witness
who
stood
trembling
a
moment
with
his
hands
over
his
face
and
then
fainted
the
fainting
of
a
person
in
a
crowd
is
a
signal
for
everybody
else
to
make
fools
of
themselves
there
was
a
rush
toward
the
fainting
man
there
was
a
cry
for
water
everybody
asked
everybody
else
to
open
the
window
and
everybody
wished
everybody
else
to
stand
back
and
give
him
air
but
nobody
opened
the
window
and
nobody
stood
back
the
only
perfectly
cool
man
in
the
room
was
small
with
a
quiet
air
of
professional
authority
he
pushed
forward
and
felt
the
patient
pulse
remarking
to
the
court
that
he
thought
it
was
a
sudden
attack
of
fever
with
delirium
when
walter
revived
small
would
have
removed
him
but
ralph
insisted
that
his
testimony
should
be
heard
under
pretense
of
watching
his
patient
small
kept
close
to
him
and
walter
began
the
same
old
story
about
small
having
arrived
at
the
office
before
eleven
when
bud
came
up
behind
the
doctor
and
fastened
his
eyes
on
the
witness
with
the
same
significant
look
and
walter
with
visions
of
the
penitentiary
before
him
halted
stammered
and
seemed
about
to
faint
again
if
the
court
please
said
bronson
this
witness
is
evidently
intimidated
by
that
stout
young
man
pointing
to
bud
i
have
seen
him
twice
interrupt
witness
testimony
by
casting
threatening
looks
at
him
i
trust
the
court
will
have
him
removed
from
the
after
a
few
moments
consultation
during
which
squire
hawkins
held
his
wig
in
place
with
one
hand
and
alternately
adjusted
his
eye
and
his
spectacles
with
the
other
the
magistrates
who
were
utterly
bewildered
by
the
turn
things
were
taking
decided
that
it
could
do
no
harm
and
that
it
was
best
to
try
the
experiment
of
removing
bud
perhaps
johnson
would
then
be
able
to
get
through
with
his
testimony
the
constable
therefore
asked
bud
if
he
would
please
leave
the
room
bud
cast
one
last
look
at
the
witness
and
walked
out
like
a
captive
bear
ralph
stood
watching
the
receding
form
of
bud
the
emergency
had
made
him
as
cool
as
small
ever
was
bud
stopped
at
the
door
where
he
was
completely
out
of
sight
of
the
witness
concealed
by
the
excited
spectators
who
stood
on
the
benches
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
front
the
witness
will
please
proceed
said
bronson
if
the
court
please
it
was
ralph
who
spoke
i
believe
i
have
as
much
at
stake
in
this
trial
as
any
one
that
witness
is
evidently
intimidated
but
not
by
means
i
ask
that
small
be
removed
out
of
sight
of
the
witness
a
most
extraordinary
request
truly
this
was
what
small
bland
countenance
said
he
did
not
open
his
lips
it
no
more
than
fair
said
squire
hawkins
adjusting
his
wig
that
the
witness
be
relieved
of
everything
that
anybody
might
think
affects
his
veracity
in
this
matter
small
giving
walter
one
friendly
appealing
look
moved
back
by
the
door
and
stood
alongside
bud
as
meek
quiet
and
disinterested
as
any
man
in
the
house
the
witness
will
now
proceed
with
his
testimony
this
time
it
was
squire
hawkins
who
spoke
bronson
had
been
attacked
with
a
suspicion
that
this
witness
was
not
just
what
he
wanted
and
had
relapsed
into
silence
walter
struggle
was
by
no
means
ended
by
the
disappearance
of
small
and
bud
there
came
the
recollection
of
his
mother
stern
face
a
face
which
had
never
been
a
motive
toward
the
right
but
only
a
goad
to
deception
what
would
she
say
if
he
should
confess
just
as
he
had
recovered
himself
and
was
about
to
repeat
the
old
lie
which
had
twice
died
upon
his
lips
at
the
sight
of
bud
look
he
caught
sight
of
another
face
which
made
him
tremble
again
it
was
the
lofty
and
terrible
countenance
of
soden
one
might
have
thought
from
the
expression
it
wore
that
the
seven
last
vials
were
in
his
hands
the
seven
apocalyptic
trumpets
waiting
for
his
lips
and
the
seven
thunders
sitting
upon
his
eyebrows
the
moment
that
walter
saw
him
he
smelled
the
brimstone
on
his
own
garments
he
felt
himself
upon
the
crumbling
brink
of
the
precipice
with
perdition
below
him
now
i
am
sure
that
brother
sodoms
were
not
made
wholly
in
vain
there
are
plenty
of
men
like
walter
johnson
whose
feeble
consciences
need
all
the
support
they
can
get
from
the
fear
of
perdition
and
who
are
incapable
of
any
other
conception
of
it
than
a
coarse
and
materialistic
ones
let
us
set
it
down
to
the
credit
of
brother
sodom
with
his
stiff
stock
his
thunderous
face
and
his
awful
walk
that
his
influence
over
walter
was
on
the
side
of
truth
please
proceed
said
squire
hawkins
to
walter
the
squire
wig
lay
on
one
side
he
had
forgotten
to
adjust
his
eye
and
he
leaned
forward
tremulous
with
interest
well
then
said
walter
looking
not
at
the
court
nor
at
bronson
nor
at
the
prisoner
but
furtively
at
soden
well
then
if
i
must
and
soden
awful
face
seemed
to
answer
that
he
surely
must
well
then
i
hope
you
wo
send
me
to
prison
this
to
squire
hawkins
whose
face
reassured
him
but
oh
i
do
see
how
i
can
but
one
look
at
soden
assured
him
that
he
could
and
that
he
must
and
so
with
an
agony
painful
to
the
spectators
he
told
the
story
in
driblets
how
while
yet
in
lewisburg
he
had
been
made
a
member
of
a
gang
of
which
small
was
chief
how
they
concealed
from
him
the
names
of
all
the
band
except
six
of
whom
the
joneses
and
small
were
three
here
there
was
a
scuffle
at
the
door
the
court
demanded
silence
small
trying
to
git
out
plague
take
him
said
bud
who
stood
with
his
back
planted
against
the
door
i
like
the
court
to
send
and
git
his
trunk
afore
he
has
a
chance
to
burn
up
all
the
papers
that
in
it
constable
you
will
arrest
small
peter
jones
and
william
jones
send
two
deputies
to
bring
small
trunk
into
court
said
squire
underwood
the
prosecuting
attorney
was
silent
walter
then
told
of
the
robbery
at
schroeder
told
where
he
and
small
had
whittled
the
fence
while
the
joneses
entered
the
house
and
confirmed
ralph
story
by
telling
how
they
had
seen
ralph
in
a
and
how
they
had
met
the
on
the
hill
be
sure
said
the
old
man
who
had
not
ventured
to
hold
up
his
head
after
he
was
arrested
until
walter
began
his
testimony
walter
felt
inclined
to
stop
but
he
could
not
do
it
for
there
stood
soden
looking
to
him
like
a
messenger
from
the
skies
or
the
bottomless
pit
sent
to
extort
the
last
word
from
his
guilty
soul
he
felt
that
he
was
making
a
clean
breast
of
it
at
the
risk
of
perdition
with
the
penitentiary
thrown
in
if
he
faltered
and
so
he
told
the
whole
thing
as
though
it
had
been
the
day
of
doom
and
by
the
time
he
was
through
small
trunk
was
in
court
here
a
new
hubbub
took
place
at
the
door
it
was
none
other
than
the
crazy
pauper
tom
bifield
who
personated
general
andrew
jackson
in
the
he
had
caught
some
inkling
of
the
trial
and
had
escaped
in
bill
jones
absence
his
red
plume
was
flying
and
in
his
tattered
and
filthy
garb
he
was
indeed
a
picturesque
figure
squar
said
he
elbowing
his
way
through
the
crowd
i
kin
tell
you
sornethin
i
gineral
andrew
jackson
lost
my
head
at
bueny
visty
this
head
growed
on
it
good
fer
much
one
side
tater
but
sound
as
a
nut
now
i
kind
give
you
information
bronson
with
the
quick
perceptions
of
a
politician
had
begun
to
see
which
way
future
winds
would
probably
blow
if
the
court
please
he
said
this
man
is
not
wholly
sane
but
we
might
get
valuable
information
out
of
him
i
suggest
that
his
testimony
be
taken
for
what
it
is
worth
no
you
do
swar
me
broke
in
the
lunatic
not
if
i
knows
myself
you
see
when
a
feller
got
one
side
of
his
head
tater
he
mighty
onsartain
like
you
do
swar
me
fer
i
ca
tell
what
minute
the
tater
side
begin
to
talk
i
talkin
out
of
the
lef
side
now
and
i
all
right
but
you
do
swar
me
but
ef
you
send
some
of
your
constables
out
to
the
barn
at
the
and
look
under
the
in
the
corner
you
find
some
things
maybe
as
has
been
fer
some
time
and
that
out
of
the
tater
side
nuther
meantime
bud
did
not
rest
hearing
the
nature
of
the
testimony
given
by
hank
banta
before
he
entered
he
attacked
hank
and
vowed
he
send
him
to
prison
if
he
did
make
a
clean
breast
hank
was
a
thorough
coward
and
now
that
his
friends
were
prisoners
was
ready
enough
to
tell
the
truth
if
he
could
be
protected
from
prosecution
seeing

the

if

please
said
he
i
have
tried

much
i
might
feel
assured
that
he
was
innocent
and
that
he
would
be
able
to
prove
his
innocence
i
now
enter

in

that
of

and
i
ask

time
to
examine
the
evidence
in
the
case
of
the
other
parties
under

i
am
proud
to
think
that
my
efforts
have
been
the

of
sifting
the

of
freeing

of

proposed
three
cheers
for

and
they
were
given
with
a
will
by
the
people
who
would
have
hanged
him
an
hour
before

gave
it
as
her
opinion

hannah

but
a

way
and

soon
in
the
presence
of
the
court
trembling
for
fear
of
some
new
calamity
hannah

it
was

who
spoke
hannah
thomson
this

wishes

eighteen

a
purty
court
you
dr
underwood
be
careful
means
or
i
shall
have
to
fine
you
for
contempt
of
court
but
the
people
who
were
in
the
cheering
humor
cheered
hannah
and
the
justices
and
then
cheered
ralph
again
granny
sanders
shook
hands
with
him
and
allers
knowed
he
come
out
right
it
allers
like
as
if
small
war
jist
the
sort
to
tie
to
you
know
and
old
john
pearson
went
home
after
drinking
two
or
three
glasses
of
welch
whisky
keeping
time
to
an
imaginary
triumphal
march
and
feeling
prouder
than
he
had
ever
felt
since
he
fit
the
britishers
under
scott
at
lane
he
told
his
wife
that
the
master
had
jist
knocked
the
offen
that
air
young
lawyer
from
lewisburg
walter
was
held
to
bail
that
he
might
appear
as
a
witness
and
ralph
might
have
sent
his
aunt
a
roland
for
an
oliver
but
he
only
sent
a
note
to
his
uncle
asking
him
to
go
walter
bail
if
he
had
been
resentful
he
could
not
have
wished
for
a
more
complete
revenge
than
the
day
had
brought
chapter
xxxii
after
the
battle
nothing
can
be
more
demoralizing
in
the
long
run
than
lynch
law
and
yet
lynch
law
often
originates
in
a
burst
of
generous
indignation
which
is
not
willing
to
suffer
a
bold
oppressor
to
escape
by
means
of
corrupt
and
cowardly
courts
it
is
oftener
born
of
fear
both
motives
powerfully
agitated
the
people
of
the
region
round
about
clifty
as
night
drew
on
after
ralph
acquittal
they
were
justly
indignant
that
ralph
had
been
made
the
victim
of
such
a
conspiracy
and
they
were
frightened
at
the
unseen
danger
to
the
community
from
such
a
band
as
that
of
small
it
was
certain
that
they
did
not
know
the
full
extent
of
the
danger
as
yet
and
what
small
might
do
with
a
jury
or
what
pete
jones
might
do
with
a
sheriff
was
a
question
i
must
not
detain
the
reader
to
tell
how
the
mob
rose
nobody
knows
how
such
things
come
about
their
origin
is
as
inexplicable
as
that
of
an
earthquake
but
at
any
rate
a
rope
was
twice
put
round
small
neck
during
that
night
and
both
times
small
was
saved
only
by
the
nerve
and
address
of
ralph
who
had
learned
how
unjust
mob
law
may
be
as
for
small
he
neither
trembled
when
they
were
ready
to
hang
him
nor
looked
relieved
when
he
was
saved
nor
showed
the
slightest
flush
of
penitence
or
gratitude
he
bore
himself
in
a
quiet
gentlemanly
way
throughout
like
the
admirable
villain
that
he
was
he
waived
a
preliminary
examination
the
next
day
his
father
went
his
bail
and
he
forfeited
bail
and
disappeared
from
the
county
and
from
the
horizon
of
my
story
two
reports
concerning
small
have
been
in
circulation
one
that
he
was
running
a
in
san
francisco
the
other
that
he
was
curing
consumption
in
new
york
by
some
quack
process
if
this
latter
were
true
it
would
leave
it
an
open
question
whether
ralph
did
well
to
save
him
from
the
gallows
pete
jones
and
bill
as
usually
happens
to
the
rougher
villains
went
to
prison
and
when
their
terms
had
expired
moved
to
pike
county
missouri
but
it
is
about
hannah
that
you
wish
to
hear
and
that
i
wish
to
tell
she
went
straight
from
the
court
room
to
flat
creek
climbed
to
her
chamber
packed
in
a
handkerchief
all
her
earthly
goods
consisting
chiefly
of
a
few
family
relics
and
turned
her
back
on
the
house
of
means
forever
at
the
gate
she
met
the
old
woman
who
shook
her
fist
in
the
girl
face
and
gave
her
a
parting
benediction
in
the
words
you
ongrateful
critter
you
go
i
glad
to
be
shed
of
you
at
the
barn
she
met
bud
and
he
told
her
with
a
little
huskiness
in
his
voice
while
a
tear
glistened
in
her
eyes
bud
had
been
a
friend
in
need
and
such
a
friend
one
does
not
leave
without
a
pang
where
are
you
going
can
i
no
no
and
with
that
she
hastened
on
afraid
that
bud
would
offer
to
hitch
up
the
roan
colt
and
she
did
not
want
to
add
to
his
domestic
unhappiness
by
compromising
him
in
that
way
it
was
dusk
and
was
raining
when
she
left
the
hours
were
long
the
road
was
lonely
and
after
the
revelations
of
that
day
it
did
not
seem
wholly
safe
but
from
the
moment
that
she
found
herself
free
her
heart
had
been
ready
to
break
with
an
impatient
homesickness
what
though
there
might
be
robbers
in
the
woods
what
though
there
were
ten
rough
miles
to
travel
what
though
the
rain
was
in
her
face
what
though
she
had
not
tasted
food
since
the
morning
of
that
exciting
day
flat
creek
and
bondage
were
behind
freedom
mother
shocky
and
home
were
before
her
and
her
feet
grew
lighter
with
the
thought
and
if
she
needed
any
other
joy
it
was
to
know
that
the
master
was
clear
and
he
would
come
and
so
she
traversed
the
weary
distance
and
so
she
inquired
and
found
the
house
the
beautiful
homely
old
house
of
beautiful
homely
old
nancy
sawyer
and
knocked
and
was
admitted
and
fell
down
faint
and
weary
at
her
blind
mother
feet
and
laid
her
tired
head
in
her
mother
lap
and
wept
and
wept
like
a
child
and
said
o
mother
i
free
free
while
the
mother
tears
baptized
her
face
and
the
trembling
fingers
combed
out
her
tresses
and
shocky
stood
by
her
and
cried
i
knowed
god
would
forget
you
hanner
hannah
was
ready
now
to
do
anything
by
which
she
could
support
her
mother
and
shocky
she
was
strong
and
inured
to
toil
she
was
willing
and
cheerful
and
she
would
gladly
have
gone
to
service
if
by
that
means
she
could
have
supported
the
family
and
for
that
matter
her
mother
was
already
able
nearly
to
support
herself
by
her
knitting
but
hannah
had
been
carefully
educated
when
young
and
at
that
moment
the
old
public
schools
were
being
organized
into
a
graded
school
and
the
good
minister
who
shall
be
nameless
because
he
is
perhaps
still
living
in
indiana
and
who
in
methodist
parlance
was
called
the
of
lewisburg
station
this
good
minister
and
miss
nancy
sawyer
got
hannah
a
place
as
teacher
in
the
primary
department
and
then
a
little
house
with
four
rooms
was
rented
and
a
little
a
very
little
furniture
was
put
into
it
and
the
old
sweet
home
was
established
again
the
father
was
gone
never
to
come
back
again
but
the
rest
were
here
and
somehow
hannah
kept
waiting
for
somebody
else
to
come
chapter
xxxiii
into
the
light
for
two
weeks
longer
ralph
taught
at
the
flat
creek
he
was
everybody
hero
and
he
was
bud
idol
he
did
what
he
could
to
get
bud
and
martha
together
and
though
bud
always
saw
her
safe
home
after
this
and
called
on
her
every
sunday
evening
yet
to
save
his
life
he
could
not
forget
his
big
fists
and
his
big
feet
long
enough
to
say
what
he
most
wanted
to
say
and
what
martha
most
wanted
him
to
say
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
ralph
found
himself
exceedingly
weary
of
flat
creek
and
exceedingly
glad
to
hear
from
means
that
the
had
gin
out
it
gave
him
a
good
excuse
to
return
to
lewisburg
where
his
heart
and
his
treasure
were
a
certain
sense
of
delicacy
had
kept
him
from
writing
to
hannah
just
yet
when
he
got
to
lewisburg
he
had
good
news
his
uncle
ashamed
of
his
previous
neglect
and
perhaps
with
an
eye
to
his
nephew
growing
popularity
had
got
him
the
charge
of
the
grammar
department
in
the
new
graded
school
in
the
village
so
he
quietly
arranged
to
board
at
a
his
aunt
could
not
have
him
about
of
which
fact
he
was
very
glad
she
could
not
but
feel
she
said
that
he
might
have
taken
better
care
of
walter
than
he
did
when
they
were
only
four
miles
apart
he
did
not
hasten
to
call
on
hannah
why
should
he
he
sent
her
a
message
of
no
consequence
in
itself
by
nancy
sawyer
then
he
took
possession
of
his
school
and
then
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
of
school
he
went
as
he
had
appointed
to
himself
to
see
hannah
thomson
and
she
with
some
sweet
presentiment
had
got
things
ready
by
fixing
up
the
room
as
well
as
she
could
and
miss
nancy
sawyer
who
had
seen
ralph
that
afternoon
had
guessed
that
he
was
going
to
see
hannah
it
wonderful
how
much
enjoyment
a
generous
heart
can
get
out
of
the
happiness
of
others
is
not
that
what
he
meant
when
he
said
of
such
as
miss
sawyer
that
they
should
have
a
in
this
life
for
all
their
sacrifices
did
not
miss
nancy
enjoy
a
hundred
weddings
and
have
the
love
of
five
hundred
children
and
so
miss
nancy
just
happened
over
at
thomson
humble
home
and
just
in
the
most
way
asked
that
lady
and
shocky
to
come
over
to
her
house
shocky
wanted
hannah
to
come
too
but
hannah
blushed
a
little
and
said
that
she
would
rather
not
and
when
she
was
left
alone
hannah
fixed
her
hair
two
or
three
times
and
swept
the
hearth
and
moved
the
chairs
first
one
way
and
then
another
and
did
a
good
many
other
needless
things
needless
for
a
lover
if
he
be
a
lover
does
not
see
furniture
or
dress
and
then
she
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
tried
to
sew
and
tried
to
look
unconcerned
and
tried
to
feel
unconcerned
and
tried
not
to
expect
anybody
and
tried
to
make
her
heart
keep
still
and
tried
in
vain
for
a
gentle
rap
at
the
door
sent
her
pulse
up
twenty
beats
a
minute
and
made
her
face
burn
and
hartsook
was
for
the
first
time
abashed
in
the
presence
of
hannah
for
the
oppressed
girl
had
in
two
weeks
blossomed
out
into
the
woman
and
ralph
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
talked
of
his
school
and
her
school
and
everything
else
but
what
he
wanted
to
talk
about
and
then
the
conversation
drifted
back
to
flat
creek
and
to
the
walk
through
the
pasture
and
to
the
tree
and
to
the
painful
talk
in
the
lane
and
hannah
begged
to
be
forgiven
and
ralph
laughed
at
the
idea
that
she
had
done
anything
wrong
and
she
praised
his
goodness
to
shocky
and
he
drew
her
little
note
out
of
but
i
agreed
not
tell
you
where
he
kept
it
and
then
she
blushed
and
he
told
how
the
note
had
sustained
him
and
how
her
white
face
kept
up
his
courage
in
his
flight
down
the
bed
of
clifty
creek
and
he
sat
a
little
nearer
to
show
her
the
note
that
he
had
carried
in
his
bosom
i
have
told
it
and
but
i
must
not
proceed
a
ever
so
beautiful
in
itself
will
not
bear
telling
and
so
i
shall
leave
a
little
gap
just
here
which
you
may
fill
up
as
you
please
somehow
they
never
knew
how
they
got
to
talking
about
the
future
instead
of
the
past
after
that
and
to
planning
their
two
lives
as
one
life
and
and
when
miss
nancy
and
thomson
returned
later
in
the
evening
ralph
was
standing
by
the
but
shocky
noticed
that
his
chair
was
close
to
hannah
and
good
miss
nancy
sawyer
looked
in
hannah
face
and
was
happy
chapter
xxxiv
how
it
came
out
we
are
all
children
in
reading
stories
we
want
more
than
all
else
to
know
how
it
all
came
out
at
the
end
and
if
our
taste
is
not
perverted
we
like
it
to
come
out
well
for
my
part
ever
since
i
began
to
write
this
story
i
have
been
anxious
to
know
how
it
was
going
to
come
out
well
there
were
very
few
invited
it
took
place
at
ten
in
the
morning
the
came
of
course
miss
nancy
sawyer
was
there
but
ralph
uncle
was
away
and
aunt
matilda
had
a
sore
throat
and
could
come
perhaps
the
memory
of
the
fact
that
she
had
refused
thomson
the
pauper
a
bed
for
two
nights
affected
her
throat
but
miss
nancy
and
her
sister
were
there
and
the
preacher
and
that
was
all
besides
the
family
and
bud
and
martha
of
course
bud
and
martha
came
and
driving
martha
to
a
wedding
in
a
jumper
was
the
one
opportunity
bud
needed
his
hands
were
busy
his
big
boots
were
out
of
sight
and
it
was
so
easy
to
slip
from
ralph
love
affair
to
his
own
that
bud
somehow
in
pulling
martha
hawkins
shawl
about
her
stammered
out
half
a
proposal
which
martha
generous
soul
took
for
the
whole
ceremony
and
accepted
and
bud
was
so
happy
that
ralph
guessed
from
his
face
and
voice
that
the
agony
was
over
and
bud
was
betrothed
at
last
to
the
gal
as
was
a
gal
and
after
ralph
and
hannah
were
married
there
was
no
trip
ralph
only
changed
his
and
became
head
of
the
house
at
thomson
thereafter
after
it
was
all
over
bud
came
to
hartsook
and
snickering
just
a
little
said
as
how
as
him
and
martha
had
fixed
it
all
up
and
now
they
wanted
to
ax
his
advice
and
martha
proud
but
blushing
came
up
and
nodded
assent
bud
said
as
how
as
he
had
got
no
nor
nothin
and
as
how
as
he
wanted
to
be
somethin
and
put
in
his
best
licks
fer
him
you
know
and
that
marthy
she
was
of
the
same
way
of
thinkin
and
that
was
a
blessin
and
the
squire
was
to
marry
agin
and
marthy
would
ruther
vacate
and
his
mother
and
mirandy
was
sech
as
he
would
take
no
wife
to
and
he
thought
as
how
hartsook
might
think
of
some
way
or
some
place
where
he
and
marthy
mout
make
a
livin
fer
the
present
and
put
in
their
best
licks
fer
him
you
know
ralph
thought
a
moment
he
was
about
to
make
an
allusion
to
hercules
and
the
augean
stables
but
he
remembered
that
bud
would
not
understand
it
though
it
might
remind
martha
of
something
she
had
seen
at
the
east
the
time
she
was
to
bosting
bud
my
dear
friend
said
ralph
it
looks
a
little
hard
to
ask
you
to
take
a
new
wife
here
bud
looked
admiringly
at
martha
to
the
but
i
do
know
anywhere
where
you
can
do
so
much
good
for
christ
as
by
taking
charge
of
that
place
and
i
can
get
the
appointment
for
you
the
new
commissioners
want
just
such
a
man
what
d
say
marthy
said
bud
why
somebody
ought
to
do
for
the
poor
and
i
should
like
to
do
it
and
so
hercules
cleaned
the
augean
stables
and
so
my
humble
homely
hoosier
story
of
twenty
years
ago
draws
to
a
close
and
not
without
regret
i
take
leave
of
ralph
and
hannah
and
shocky
and
bud
and
martha
and
miss
nancy
and
of
my
readers
a
copy
of
the
lewisburg
came
into
my
hands
and
i
see
by
its
columns
that
ralph
hartsook
is
principal
of
the
lewisburg
academy
it
took
me
some
time
however
to
make
out
that
the
sheriff
of
the
county
israel
means
was
none
other
than
my
old
friend
bud
of
the
church
of
the
best
licks
i
was
almost
as
much
puzzled
over
his
name
as
i
was
when
i
saw
an
article
in
a
city
paper
by
thomson
on
i
should
not
have
recognized
the
writer
as
shocky
had
i
not
known
that
shocky
has
given
his
spare
time
to
making
outcasts
feel
that
god
has
not
forgot
