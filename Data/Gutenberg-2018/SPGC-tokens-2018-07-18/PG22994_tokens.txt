preface
in
republishing
these
essays
in
collected
form
it
has
seemed
best
to
issue
them
as
they
were
originally
printed
with
the
exception
of
a
few
slight
corrections
of
slips
in
the
text
and
with
the
omission
of
occasional
duplication
of
language
in
the
different
essays
a
considerable
part
of
whatever
value
they
may
possess
arises
from
the
fact
that
they
are
commentaries
in
different
periods
on
the
central
theme
of
the
influence
of
the
frontier
in
american
history
consequently
they
may
have
some
historical
significance
as
contemporaneous
attempts
of
a
student
of
american
history
at
successive
transitions
in
our
development
during
the
past
quarter
century
to
interpret
the
relations
of
the
present
to
the
past
grateful
acknowledgment
is
made
to
the
various
societies
and
periodicals
which
have
given
permission
to
reprint
the
essays
various
essays
dealing
with
the
connection
of
diplomatic
history
and
the
frontier
and
others
stressing
the
significance
of
the
section
or
geographic
province
in
american
history
are
not
included
in
the
present
collection
neither
the
french
nor
the
spanish
frontier
is
within
the
scope
of
the
volume
the
future
alone
can
disclose
how
far
these
interpretations
are
correct
for
the
age
of
colonization
which
came
gradually
to
an
end
with
the
disappearance
of
the
frontier
and
free
land
it
alone
can
reveal
how
much
of
the
courageous
creative
american
spirit
and
how
large
a
part
of
the
historic
american
ideals
are
to
be
carried
over
into
that
new
age
which
is
replacing
the
era
of
free
lands
and
of
measurable
isolation
by
consolidated
and
complex
industrial
development
and
by
increasing
resemblances
and
connections
between
the
new
world
and
the
old
but
the
larger
part
of
what
has
been
distinctive
and
valuable
in
america
contribution
to
the
history
of
the
human
spirit
has
been
due
to
this
nation
peculiar
experience
in
extending
its
type
of
frontier
into
new
regions
and
in
creating
peaceful
societies
with
new
ideals
in
the
successive
vast
and
differing
geographic
provinces
which
together
make
up
the
united
states
directly
or
indirectly
these
experiences
shaped
the
life
of
the
eastern
as
well
as
the
western
states
and
even
reacted
upon
the
old
world
and
influenced
the
direction
of
its
thought
and
its
progress
this
experience
has
been
fundamental
in
the
economic
political
and
social
characteristics
of
the
american
people
and
in
their
conceptions
of
their
destiny
writing
at
the
close
of
the
french
minister
to
the
united
states
adet
reported
to
his
government
that
jefferson
could
not
be
relied
on
to
be
devoted
to
french
interests
and
he
added
jefferson
i
say
is
american
and
by
that
name
he
can
not
be
sincerely
our
friend
an
american
is
the
born
enemy
of
all
european
peoples
obviously
erroneous
as
are
these
words
there
was
an
element
of
truth
in
them
if
we
would
understand
this
element
of
truth
we
must
study
the
transforming
influence
of
the
american
wilderness
remote
from
europe
and
by
its
resources
and
its
free
opportunities
affording
the
conditions
under
which
a
new
people
with
new
social
and
political
types
and
ideals
could
arise
to
play
its
own
part
in
the
world
and
to
influence

the
significance
of
the
frontier
in
american
history
in
a
recent
bulletin
of
the
superintendent
of
the
census
for
appear
these
significant
words
up
to
and
including
the
country
had
a
frontier
of
settlement
but
at
present
the
unsettled
area
has
been
so
broken
into
by
isolated
bodies
of
settlement
that
there
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
a
frontier
line
in
the
discussion
of
its
extent
its
westward
movement
it
can
not
therefore
any
longer
have
a
place
in
the
census
reports
this
brief
official
statement
marks
the
closing
of
a
great
historic
movement
up
to
our
own
day
american
history
has
been
in
a
large
degree
the
history
of
the
colonization
of
the
great
west
the
existence
of
an
area
of
free
land
its
continuous
recession
and
the
advance
of
american
settlement
westward
explain
american
development
behind
institutions
behind
constitutional
forms
and
modifications
lie
the
vital
forces
that
call
these
organs
into
life
and
shape
them
to
meet
changing
conditions
the
peculiarity
of
american
institutions
is
the
fact
that
they
have
been
compelled
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
changes
of
an
expanding
people
to
the
changes
involved
in
crossing
a
continent
in
winning
a
wilderness
and
in
developing
at
each
area
of
this
progress
out
of
the
primitive
economic
and
political
conditions
of
the
frontier
into
the
complexity
of
city
life
said
calhoun
in
we
are
great
and
rapidly
i
was
about
to
say
fearfully
growing
so
saying
he
touched
the
distinguishing
feature
of
american
life
all
peoples
show
development
the
germ
theory
of
politics
has
been
sufficiently
emphasized
in
the
case
of
most
nations
however
the
development
has
occurred
in
a
limited
area
and
if
the
nation
has
expanded
it
has
met
other
growing
peoples
whom
it
has
conquered
but
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
we
have
a
different
phenomenon
limiting
our
attention
to
the
atlantic
coast
we
have
the
familiar
phenomenon
of
the
evolution
of
institutions
in
a
limited
area
such
as
the
rise
of
representative
government
the
differentiation
of
simple
colonial
governments
into
complex
organs
the
progress
from
primitive
industrial
society
without
division
of
labor
up
to
manufacturing
civilization
but
we
have
in
addition
to
this
a
recurrence
of
the
process
of
evolution
in
each
western
area
reached
in
the
process
of
expansion
thus
american
development
has
exhibited
not
merely
advance
along
a
single
line
but
a
return
to
primitive
conditions
on
a
continually
advancing
frontier
line
and
a
new
development
for
that
area
american
social
development
has
been
continually
beginning
over
again
on
the
frontier
this
perennial
rebirth
this
fluidity
of
american
life
this
expansion
westward
with
its
new
opportunities
its
continuous
touch
with
the
simplicity
of
primitive
society
furnish
the
forces
dominating
american
character
the
true
point
of
view
in
the
history
of
this
nation
is
not
the
atlantic
coast
it
is
the
great
west
even
the
slavery
struggle
which
is
made
so
exclusive
an
object
of
attention
by
writers
like
professor
von
holst
occupies
its
important
place
in
american
history
because
of
its
relation
to
westward
expansion
in
this
advance
the
frontier
is
the
outer
edge
of
the
wave
the
meeting
point
between
savagery
and
civilization
much
has
been
written
about
the
frontier
from
the
point
of
view
of
border
warfare
and
the
chase
but
as
a
field
for
the
serious
study
of
the
economist
and
the
historian
it
has
been
neglected
the
american
frontier
is
sharply
distinguished
from
the
european
frontier
a
fortified
boundary
line
running
through
dense
populations
the
most
significant
thing
about
the
american
frontier
is
that
it
lies
at
the
hither
edge
of
free
land
in
the
census
reports
it
is
treated
as
the
margin
of
that
settlement
which
has
a
density
of
two
or
more
to
the
square
mile
the
term
is
an
elastic
one
and
for
our
purposes
does
not
need
sharp
definition
we
shall
consider
the
whole
frontier
belt
including
the
indian
country
and
the
outer
margin
of
the
settled
area
of
the
census
reports
this
paper
will
make
no
attempt
to
treat
the
subject
exhaustively
its
aim
is
simply
to
call
attention
to
the
frontier
as
a
fertile
field
for
investigation
and
to
suggest
some
of
the
problems
which
arise
in
connection
with
it
in
the
settlement
of
america
we
have
to
observe
how
european
life
entered
the
continent
and
how
america
modified
and
developed
that
life
and
reacted
on
europe
our
early
history
is
the
study
of
european
germs
developing
in
an
american
environment
too
exclusive
attention
has
been
paid
by
institutional
students
to
the
germanic
origins
too
little
to
the
american
factors
the
frontier
is
the
line
of
most
rapid
and
effective
americanization
the
wilderness
masters
the
colonist
it
finds
him
a
european
in
dress
industries
tools
modes
of
travel
and
thought
it
takes
him
from
the
railroad
car
and
puts
him
in
the
birch
canoe
it
strips
off
the
garments
of
civilization
and
arrays
him
in
the
hunting
shirt
and
the
moccasin
it
puts
him
in
the
log
cabin
of
the
cherokee
and
iroquois
and
runs
an
indian
palisade
around
him
before
long
he
has
gone
to
planting
indian
corn
and
plowing
with
a
sharp
stick
he
shouts
the
war
cry
and
takes
the
scalp
in
orthodox
indian
fashion
in
short
at
the
frontier
the
environment
is
at
first
too
strong
for
the
man
he
must
accept
the
conditions
which
it
furnishes
or
perish
and
so
he
fits
himself
into
the
indian
clearings
and
follows
the
indian
trails
little
by
little
he
transforms
the
wilderness
but
the
outcome
is
not
the
old
europe
not
simply
the
development
of
germanic
germs
any
more
than
the
first
phenomenon
was
a
case
of
reversion
to
the
germanic
mark
the
fact
is
that
here
is
a
new
product
that
is
american
at
first
the
frontier
was
the
atlantic
coast
it
was
the
frontier
of
europe
in
a
very
real
sense
moving
westward
the
frontier
became
more
and
more
american
as
successive
terminal
moraines
result
from
successive
glaciations
so
each
frontier
leaves
its
traces
behind
it
and
when
it
becomes
a
settled
area
the
region
still
partakes
of
the
frontier
characteristics
thus
the
advance
of
the
frontier
has
meant
a
steady
movement
away
from
the
influence
of
europe
a
steady
growth
of
independence
on
american
lines
and
to
study
this
advance
the
men
who
grew
up
under
these
conditions
and
the
political
economic
and
social
results
of
it
is
to
study
the
really
american
part
of
our
history
in
the
course
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
frontier
was
advanced
up
the
atlantic
river
courses
just
beyond
the
fall
line
and
the
tidewater
region
became
the
settled
area
in
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
another
advance
occurred
traders
followed
the
delaware
and
shawnese
indians
to
the
ohio
as
early
as
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
century
gov
spotswood
of
virginia
made
an
expedition
in
across
the
blue
ridge
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
century
saw
the
advance
of
the
and
the
palatine
germans
up
the
shenandoah
valley
into
the
western
part
of
virginia
and
along
the
piedmont
region
of
the
carolinas
the
germans
in
new
york
pushed
the
frontier
of
settlement
up
the
mohawk
to
german
flats
in
pennsylvania
the
town
of
bedford
indicates
the
line
of
settlement
settlements
soon
began
on
the
new
river
or
the
great
kanawha
and
on
the
sources
of
the
yadkin
and
french
broad
the
king
attempted
to
arrest
the
advance
by
his
proclamation
of
forbidding
settlements
beyond
the
sources
of
the
rivers
flowing
into
the
atlantic
but
in
vain
in
the
period
of
the
revolution
the
frontier
crossed
the
alleghanies
into
kentucky
and
tennessee
and
the
upper
waters
of
the
ohio
were
settled
when
the
first
census
was
taken
in
the
continuous
settled
area
was
bounded
by
a
line
which
ran
near
the
coast
of
maine
and
included
new
england
except
a
portion
of
vermont
and
new
hampshire
new
york
along
the
hudson
and
up
the
mohawk
about
schenectady
eastern
and
southern
pennsylvania
virginia
well
across
the
shenandoah
valley
and
the
carolinas
and
eastern
georgia
beyond
this
region
of
continuous
settlement
were
the
small
settled
areas
of
kentucky
and
tennessee
and
the
ohio
with
the
mountains
intervening
between
them
and
the
atlantic
area
thus
giving
a
new
and
important
character
to
the
frontier
the
isolation
of
the
region
increased
its
peculiarly
american
tendencies
and
the
need
of
transportation
facilities
to
connect
it
with
the
east
called
out
important
schemes
of
internal
improvement
which
will
be
noted
farther
on
the
west
as
a
section
began
to
evolve
from
decade
to
decade
distinct
advances
of
the
frontier
occurred
by
the
census
of
the
settled
area
included
ohio
southern
indiana
and
illinois
southeastern
missouri
and
about
of
louisiana
this
settled
area
had
surrounded
indian
areas
and
the
management
of
these
tribes
became
an
object
of
political
concern
the
frontier
region
of
the
time
lay
along
the
great
lakes
where
astor
american
fur
company
operated
in
the
indian
trade
and
beyond
the
mississippi
where
indian
traders
extended
their
activity
even
to
the
rocky
mountains
florida
also
furnished
frontier
conditions
the
mississippi
river
region
was
the
scene
of
typical
frontier
settlements
the
rising
steam
navigation
on
western
waters
the
opening
of
the
erie
canal
and
the
westward
extension
of
cotton
culture
added
five
frontier
states
to
the
union
in
this
period
grund
writing
in
declares
it
appears
then
that
the
universal
disposition
of
americans
to
emigrate
to
the
western
wilderness
in
order
to
enlarge
their
dominion
over
inanimate
nature
is
the
actual
result
of
an
expansive
power
which
is
inherent
in
them
and
which
by
continually
agitating
all
classes
of
society
is
constantly
throwing
a
large
portion
of
the
whole
population
on
the
extreme
confines
of
the
state
in
order
to
gain
space
for
its
development
hardly
is
a
new
state
or
territory
formed
before
the
same
principle
manifests
itself
again
and
gives
rise
to
a
further
emigration
and
so
is
it
destined
to
go
on
until
a
physical
barrier
must
finally
obstruct
its
progress
in
the
middle
of
this
century
the
line
indicated
by
the
present
eastern
boundary
of
indian
territory
nebraska
and
kansas
marked
the
frontier
of
the
indian
country
minnesota
and
wisconsin
still
exhibited
frontier
conditions
but
the
distinctive
frontier
of
the
period
is
found
in
california
where
the
gold
discoveries
had
sent
a
sudden
tide
of
adventurous
miners
and
in
oregon
and
the
settlements
in
utah
as
the
frontier
had
leaped
over
the
alleghanies
so
now
it
skipped
the
great
plains
and
the
rocky
mountains
and
in
the
same
way
that
the
advance
of
the
frontiersmen
beyond
the
alleghanies
had
caused
the
rise
of
important
questions
of
transportation
and
internal
improvement
so
now
the
settlers
beyond
the
rocky
mountains
needed
means
of
communication
with
the
east
and
in
the
furnishing
of
these
arose
the
settlement
of
the
great
plains
and
the
development
of
still
another
kind
of
frontier
life
railroads
fostered
by
land
grants
sent
an
increasing
tide
of
immigrants
into
the
far
west
the
united
states
army
fought
a
series
of
indian
wars
in
minnesota
dakota
and
the
indian
territory
by
the
settled
area
had
been
pushed
into
northern
michigan
wisconsin
and
minnesota
along
dakota
rivers
and
in
the
black
hills
region
and
was
ascending
the
rivers
of
kansas
and
nebraska
the
development
of
mines
in
colorado
had
drawn
isolated
frontier
settlements
into
that
region
and
montana
and
idaho
were
receiving
settlers
the
frontier
was
found
in
these
mining
camps
and
the
ranches
of
the
great
plains
the
superintendent
of
the
census
for
reports
as
previously
stated
that
the
settlements
of
the
west
lie
so
scattered
over
the
region
that
there
can
no
longer
be
said
to
be
a
frontier
line
in
these
successive
frontiers
we
find
natural
boundary
lines
which
have
served
to
mark
and
to
affect
the
characteristics
of
the
frontiers
namely
the
fall
line
the
alleghany
mountains
the
mississippi
the
missouri
where
its
direction
approximates
north
and
south
the
line
of
the
arid
lands
approximately
the
meridian
and
the
rocky
mountains
the
fall
line
marked
the
frontier
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
alleghanies
that
of
the
eighteenth
the
mississippi
that
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
the
missouri
that
of
the
middle
of
this
century
omitting
the
california
movement
and
the
belt
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
arid
tract
the
present
frontier
each
was
won
by
a
series
of
indian
wars
at
the
atlantic
frontier
one
can
study
the
germs
of
processes
repeated
at
each
successive
frontier
we
have
the
complex
european
life
sharply
precipitated
by
the
wilderness
into
the
simplicity
of
primitive
conditions
the
first
frontier
had
to
meet
its
indian
question
its
question
of
the
disposition
of
the
public
domain
of
the
means
of
intercourse
with
older
settlements
of
the
extension
of
political
organization
of
religious
and
educational
activity
and
the
settlement
of
these
and
similar
questions
for
one
frontier
served
as
a
guide
for
the
next
the
american
student
needs
not
to
go
to
the
prim
little
townships
of
sleswick
for
illustrations
of
the
law
of
continuity
and
development
for
example
he
may
study
the
origin
of
our
land
policies
in
the
colonial
land
policy
he
may
see
how
the
system
grew
by
adapting
the
statutes
to
the
customs
of
the
successive
frontiers
he
may
see
how
the
mining
experience
in
the
lead
regions
of
wisconsin
illinois
and
iowa
was
applied
to
the
mining
laws
of
the
sierras
and
how
our
indian
policy
has
been
a
series
of
experimentations
on
successive
frontiers
each
tier
of
new
states
has
found
in
the
older
ones
material
for
its
constitutions
each
frontier
has
made
similar
contributions
to
american
character
as
will
be
discussed
farther
on
but
with
all
these
similarities
there
are
essential
differences
due
to
the
place
element
and
the
time
element
it
is
evident
that
the
farming
frontier
of
the
mississippi
valley
presents
different
conditions
from
the
mining
frontier
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
frontier
reached
by
the
pacific
railroad
surveyed
into
rectangles
guarded
by
the
united
states
army
and
recruited
by
the
daily
immigrant
ship
moves
forward
at
a
swifter
pace
and
in
a
different
way
than
the
frontier
reached
by
the
birch
canoe
or
the
pack
horse
the
geologist
traces
patiently
the
shores
of
ancient
seas
maps
their
areas
and
compares
the
older
and
the
newer
it
would
be
a
work
worth
the
historian
labors
to
mark
these
various
frontiers
and
in
detail
compare
one
with
another
not
only
would
there
result
a
more
adequate
conception
of
american
development
and
characteristics
but
invaluable
additions
would
be
made
to
the
history
of
society
loria
the
italian
economist
has
urged
the
study
of
colonial
life
as
an
aid
in
understanding
the
stages
of
european
development
affirming
that
colonial
settlement
is
for
economic
science
what
the
mountain
is
for
geology
bringing
to
light
primitive
stratifications
america
he
says
has
the
key
to
the
historical
enigma
which
europe
has
sought
for
centuries
in
vain
and
the
land
which
has
no
history
reveals
luminously
the
course
of
universal
history
there
is
much
truth
in
this
the
united
states
lies
like
a
huge
page
in
the
history
of
society
line
by
line
as
we
read
this
continental
page
from
west
to
east
we
find
the
record
of
social
evolution
it
begins
with
the
indian
and
the
hunter
it
goes
on
to
tell
of
the
disintegration
of
savagery
by
the
entrance
of
the
trader
the
pathfinder
of
civilization
we
read
the
annals
of
the
pastoral
stage
in
ranch
life
the
exploitation
of
the
soil
by
the
raising
of
unrotated
crops
of
corn
and
wheat
in
sparsely
settled
farming
communities
the
intensive
culture
of
the
denser
farm
settlement
and
finally
the
manufacturing
organization
with
city
and
factory
system
this
page
is
familiar
to
the
student
of
census
statistics
but
how
little
of
it
has
been
used
by
our
historians
particularly
in
eastern
states
this
page
is
a
palimpsest
what
is
now
a
manufacturing
state
was
in
an
earlier
decade
an
area
of
intensive
farming
earlier
yet
it
had
been
a
wheat
area
and
still
earlier
the
range
had
attracted
the
thus
wisconsin
now
developing
manufacture
is
a
state
with
varied
agricultural
interests
but
earlier
it
was
given
over
to
almost
exclusive
like
north
dakota
at
the
present
time
each
of
these
areas
has
had
an
influence
in
our
economic
and
political
history
the
evolution
of
each
into
a
higher
stage
has
worked
political
transformations
but
what
constitutional
historian
has
made
any
adequate
attempt
to
interpret
political
facts
by
the
light
of
these
social
areas
and
changes
the
atlantic
frontier
was
compounded
of
fisherman
miner
and
farmer
excepting
the
fisherman
each
type
of
industry
was
on
the
march
toward
the
west
impelled
by
an
irresistible
attraction
each
passed
in
successive
waves
across
the
continent
stand
at
cumberland
gap
and
watch
the
procession
of
civilization
marching
single
file
the
buffalo
following
the
trail
to
the
salt
springs
the
indian
the
and
hunter
the
the
pioneer
farmer
and
the
frontier
has
passed
by
stand
at
south
pass
in
the
rockies
a
century
later
and
see
the
same
procession
with
wider
intervals
between
the
unequal
rate
of
advance
compels
us
to
distinguish
the
frontier
into
the
trader
frontier
the
rancher
frontier
or
the
miner
frontier
and
the
farmer
frontier
when
the
mines
and
the
cow
pens
were
still
near
the
fall
line
the
traders
pack
trains
were
tinkling
across
the
alleghanies
and
the
french
on
the
great
lakes
were
fortifying
their
posts
alarmed
by
the
british
trader
birch
canoe
when
the
trappers
scaled
the
rockies
the
farmer
was
still
near
the
mouth
of
the
missouri
why
was
it
that
the
indian
trader
passed
so
rapidly
across
the
continent
what
effects
followed
from
the
trader
frontier
the
trade
was
coeval
with
american
discovery
the
norsemen
vespuccius
verrazani
hudson
john
smith
all
trafficked
for
furs
the
plymouth
pilgrims
settled
in
indian
cornfields
and
their
first
return
cargo
was
of
beaver
and
lumber
the
records
of
the
various
new
england
colonies
show
how
steadily
exploration
was
carried
into
the
wilderness
by
this
trade
what
is
true
for
new
england
is
as
would
be
expected
even
plainer
for
the
rest
of
the
colonies
all
along
the
coast
from
maine
to
georgia
the
indian
trade
opened
up
the
river
courses
steadily
the
trader
passed
westward
utilizing
the
older
lines
of
french
trade
the
ohio
the
great
lakes
the
mississippi
the
missouri
and
the
platte
the
lines
of
western
advance
were
ascended
by
traders
they
found
the
passes
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
guided
lewis
and
clark
frémont
and
bidwell
the
explanation
of
the
rapidity
of
this
advance
is
connected
with
the
effects
of
the
trader
on
the
indian
the
trading
post
left
the
unarmed
tribes
at
the
mercy
of
those
that
had
purchased
a
truth
which
the
iroquois
indians
wrote
in
blood
and
so
the
remote
and
unvisited
tribes
gave
eager
welcome
to
the
trader
the
savages
wrote
la
salle
take
better
care
of
us
french
than
of
their
own
children
from
us
only
can
they
get
guns
and
goods
this
accounts
for
the
trader
power
and
the
rapidity
of
his
advance
thus
the
disintegrating
forces
of
civilization
entered
the
wilderness
every
river
valley
and
indian
trail
became
a
fissure
in
indian
society
and
so
that
society
became
honeycombed
long
before
the
pioneer
farmer
appeared
on
the
scene
primitive
indian
life
had
passed
away
the
farmers
met
indians
armed
with
guns
the
trading
frontier
while
steadily
undermining
indian
power
by
making
the
tribes
ultimately
dependent
on
the
whites
yet
through
its
sale
of
guns
gave
to
the
indian
increased
power
of
resistance
to
the
farming
frontier
french
colonization
was
dominated
by
its
trading
frontier
english
colonization
by
its
farming
frontier
there
was
an
antagonism
between
the
two
frontiers
as
between
the
two
nations
said
duquesne
to
the
iroquois
are
you
ignorant
of
the
difference
between
the
king
of
england
and
the
king
of
france
go
see
the
forts
that
our
king
has
established
and
you
will
see
that
you
can
still
hunt
under
their
very
walls
they
have
been
placed
for
your
advantage
in
places
which
you
frequent
the
english
on
the
contrary
are
no
sooner
in
possession
of
a
place
than
the
game
is
driven
away
the
forest
falls
before
them
as
they
advance
and
the
soil
is
laid
bare
so
that
you
can
scarce
find
the
wherewithal
to
erect
a
shelter
for
the
night
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
opposition
of
the
interests
of
the
trader
and
the
farmer
the
indian
trade
pioneered
the
way
for
civilization
the
buffalo
trail
became
the
indian
trail
and
this
became
the
trace
the
trails
widened
into
roads
and
the
roads
into
turnpikes
and
these
in
turn
were
transformed
into
railroads
the
same
origin
can
be
shown
for
the
railroads
of
the
south
the
far
west
and
the
dominion
of
canada
the
trading
posts
reached
by
these
trails
were
on
the
sites
of
indian
villages
which
had
been
placed
in
positions
suggested
by
nature
and
these
trading
posts
situated
so
as
to
command
the
water
systems
of
the
country
have
grown
into
such
cities
as
albany
pittsburgh
detroit
chicago
louis
council
bluffs
and
kansas
city
thus
civilization
in
america
has
followed
the
arteries
made
by
geology
pouring
an
ever
richer
tide
through
them
until
at
last
the
slender
paths
of
aboriginal
intercourse
have
been
broadened
and
interwoven
into
the
complex
mazes
of
modern
commercial
lines
the
wilderness
has
been
interpenetrated
by
lines
of
civilization
growing
ever
more
numerous
it
is
like
the
steady
growth
of
a
complex
nervous
system
for
the
originally
simple
inert
continent
if
one
would
understand
why
we
are
one
nation
rather
than
a
collection
of
isolated
states
he
must
study
this
economic
and
social
consolidation
of
the
country
in
this
progress
from
savage
conditions
lie
topics
for
the
evolutionist
the
effect
of
the
indian
frontier
as
a
consolidating
agent
in
our
history
is
important
from
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
various
intercolonial
congresses
have
been
called
to
treat
with
indians
and
establish
common
measures
of
defense
particularism
was
strongest
in
colonies
with
no
indian
frontier
this
frontier
stretched
along
the
western
border
like
a
cord
of
union
the
indian
was
a
common
danger
demanding
united
action
most
celebrated
of
these
conferences
was
the
albany
congress
of
called
to
treat
with
the
six
nations
and
to
consider
plans
of
union
even
a
cursory
reading
of
the
plan
proposed
by
the
congress
reveals
the
importance
of
the
frontier
the
powers
of
the
general
council
and
the
officers
were
chiefly
the
determination
of
peace
and
war
with
the
indians
the
regulation
of
indian
trade
the
purchase
of
indian
lands
and
the
creation
and
government
of
new
settlements
as
a
security
against
the
indians
it
is
evident
that
the
unifying
tendencies
of
the
revolutionary
period
were
facilitated
by
the
previous
coöperation
in
the
regulation
of
the
frontier
in
this
connection
may
be
mentioned
the
importance
of
the
frontier
from
that
day
to
this
as
a
military
training
school
keeping
alive
the
power
of
resistance
to
aggression
and
developing
the
stalwart
and
rugged
qualities
of
the
frontiersman
it
would
not
be
possible
in
the
limits
of
this
paper
to
trace
the
other
frontiers
across
the
continent
travelers
of
the
eighteenth
century
found
the
cowpens
among
the
canebrakes
and
peavine
pastures
of
the
south
and
the
cow
drivers
took
their
droves
to
charleston
philadelphia
and
new
york
travelers
at
the
close
of
the
war
of
met
droves
of
more
than
a
thousand
cattle
and
swine
from
the
interior
of
ohio
going
to
pennsylvania
to
fatten
for
the
philadelphia
market
the
ranges
of
the
great
plains
with
ranch
and
cowboy
and
nomadic
life
are
things
of
yesterday
and
of
the
experience
of
the
carolina
cowpens
guided
the
ranchers
of
texas
one
element
favoring
the
rapid
extension
of
the
rancher
frontier
is
the
fact
that
in
a
remote
country
lacking
transportation
facilities
the
product
must
be
in
small
bulk
or
must
be
able
to
transport
itself
and
the
cattle
raiser
could
easily
drive
his
product
to
market
the
effect
of
these
great
ranches
on
the
subsequent
agrarian
history
of
the
localities
in
which
they
existed
should
be
studied
the
maps
of
the
census
reports
show
an
uneven
advance
of
the
frontier
with
tongues
of
settlement
pushed
forward
and
with
indentations
of
wilderness
in
part
this
is
due
to
indian
resistance
in
part
to
the
location
of
river
valleys
and
passes
in
part
to
the
unequal
force
of
the
centers
of
frontier
attraction
among
the
important
centers
of
attraction
may
be
mentioned
the
following
fertile
and
favorably
situated
soils
salt
springs
mines
and
army
posts
the
frontier
army
post
serving
to
protect
the
settlers
from
the
indians
has
also
acted
as
a
wedge
to
open
the
indian
country
and
has
been
a
nucleus
for
settlement
in
this
connection
mention
should
also
be
made
of
the
government
military
and
exploring
expeditions
in
determining
the
lines
of
settlement
but
all
the
more
important
expeditions
were
greatly
indebted
to
the
earliest
pathmakers
the
indian
guides
the
traders
and
trappers
and
the
french
voyageurs
who
were
inevitable
parts
of
governmental
expeditions
from
the
days
of
lewis
and
clark
each
expedition
was
an
epitome
of
the
previous
factors
in
western
advance
in
an
interesting
monograph
victor
hehn
has
traced
the
effect
of
salt
upon
early
european
development
and
has
pointed
out
how
it
affected
the
lines
of
settlement
and
the
form
of
administration
a
similar
study
might
be
made
for
the
salt
springs
of
the
united
states
the
early
settlers
were
tied
to
the
coast
by
the
need
of
salt
without
which
they
could
not
preserve
their
meats
or
live
in
comfort
writing
in
bishop
spangenburg
says
of
a
colony
for
which
he
was
seeking
lands
in
north
carolina
they
will
require
salt
other
necessaries
which
they
can
neither
manufacture
nor
raise
either
they
must
go
to
charleston
which
is
miles
distant
or
else
they
must
go
to
boling
point
in
v
a
on
a
branch
of
the
james
is
also
miles
from
here
or
else
they
must
go
down
the
roanoke
i
know
not
how
many
miles
where
salt
is
brought
up
from
the
cape
fear
this
may
serve
as
a
typical
illustration
an
annual
pilgrimage
to
the
coast
for
salt
thus
became
essential
taking
flocks
or
furs
and
ginseng
root
the
early
settlers
sent
their
pack
trains
after
seeding
time
each
year
to
the
coast
this
proved
to
be
an
important
educational
influence
since
it
was
almost
the
only
way
in
which
the
pioneer
learned
what
was
going
on
in
the
east
but
when
discovery
was
made
of
the
salt
springs
of
the
kanawha
and
the
holston
and
kentucky
and
central
new
york
the
west
began
to
be
freed
from
dependence
on
the
coast
it
was
in
part
the
effect
of
finding
these
salt
springs
that
enabled
settlement
to
cross
the
mountains
from
the
time
the
mountains
rose
between
the
pioneer
and
the
seaboard
a
new
order
of
americanism
arose
the
west
and
the
east
began
to
get
out
of
touch
of
each
other
the
settlements
from
the
sea
to
the
mountains
kept
connection
with
the
rear
and
had
a
certain
solidarity
but
the
men
grew
more
and
more
independent
the
east
took
a
narrow
view
of
american
advance
and
nearly
lost
these
men
kentucky
and
tennessee
history
bears
abundant
witness
to
the
truth
of
this
statement
the
east
began
to
try
to
hedge
and
limit
westward
expansion
though
webster
could
declare
that
there
were
no
alleghanies
in
his
politics
yet
in
politics
in
general
they
were
a
very
solid
factor
the
exploitation
of
the
beasts
took
hunter
and
trader
to
the
west
the
exploitation
of
the
grasses
took
the
rancher
west
and
the
exploitation
of
the
virgin
soil
of
the
river
valleys
and
prairies
attracted
the
farmer
good
soils
have
been
the
most
continuous
attraction
to
the
farmer
frontier
the
land
hunger
of
the

of

he

thence
he
passed
to

where
his
settlement
was

landmark
on

here

he
helped
to
open

this
suggestive
passage
generally
in
all
the
western
settlements
three
classes
like
the
waves
of
the
ocean
have
rolled
one
after
the
other
first
comes
the
pioneer
who
depends
for
the
subsistence
of
his
family
chiefly
upon
the
natural
growth
of
vegetation
called
the
range
and
the
proceeds
of
hunting
his
implements
of
agriculture
are
rude
chiefly
of
his
own
make
and
his
efforts
directed
mainly
to
a
crop
of
corn
and
a
truck
patch
the
last
is
a
rude
garden
for
growing
cabbage
beans
corn
for
roasting
ears
cucumbers
and
potatoes
a
log
cabin
and
occasionally
a
stable
and
and
a
field
of
a
dozen
acres
the
timber
girdled
or
deadened
and
fenced
are
enough
for
his
occupancy
it
is
quite
immaterial
whether
he
ever
becomes
the
owner
of
the
soil
he
is
the
occupant
for
the
time
being
pays
no
rent
and
feels
as
independent
as
the
lord
of
the
manor
with
a
horse
cow
and
one
or
two
breeders
of
swine
he
strikes
into
the
woods
with
his
family
and
becomes
the
founder
of
a
new
county
or
perhaps
state
he
builds
his
cabin
gathers
around
him
a
few
other
families
of
similar
tastes
and
habits
and
occupies
till
the
range
is
somewhat
subdued
and
hunting
a
little
precarious
or
which
is
more
frequently
the
case
till
the
neighbors
crowd
around
roads
bridges
and
fields
annoy
him
and
he
lacks
elbow
room
the
preëmption
law
enables
him
to
dispose
of
his
cabin
and
cornfield
to
the
next
class
of
emigrants
and
to
employ
his
own
figures
he
breaks
for
the
high
timber
clears
out
for
the
new
purchase
or
migrates
to
arkansas
or
texas
to
work
the
same
process
over
the
next
class
of
emigrants
purchase
the
lands
add

to

clear

rough
bridges
over
the
streams
put
up

with

and

or
stone
chimneys
occasionally
plant
orchards
build
mills
and
exhibit
the
picture
and
forms
of
plain
frugal
civilized
life
another
wave
rolls
on
the
men
of
capital
and
enterprise
come
the
settler
is
ready
to
sell
out
and
take
the
advantage
of
the
rise
in
property
push
farther
into
the
interior
and
become
himself
a
man
of
capital
and
enterprise
in
turn
the
small
village
rises
to
a
spacious
town
or
city
substantial
edifices
of

are
seen
broadcloths

leghorns

and
all
the
refinements

elegancies
frivolities
and
fashions
are
in
vogue
thus
wave
after
wave
is
rolling
westward
the
real
eldorado
is
still
farther

portion
of
the
two
first
classes
remain
stationary
amidst
the
general
movement
improve
their
habits
and
condition
and
rise
in
the
scale
of
society
the
writer
has
traveled
much
amongst
the
first
class
the
real
pioneers
he
has
lived
many
years
in
connection
with
the
second
grade
and
now
the
third
wave
is
sweeping
over
large
districts
of
indiana
illinois
and
missouri
migration
has
become
almost
a
habit
in
the
west
hundreds
of
men
can
be
found
not
over
years
of
age
who
have
settled
for
the
fourth
fifth
or
sixth
time
on
a
new
spot
to
sell
out
and
remove
only
a
few
hundred
miles
makes
up
a
portion
of
the
variety
of
backwoods
life
and
manners
omitting
those
of
the
pioneer
farmers
who
move
from
the
love
of
adventure
the
advance
of
the
more
steady
farmer
is
easy
to
understand
obviously
the
immigrant
was
attracted
by
the
cheap
lands
of
the
frontier
and
even
the
native
farmer
felt
their
influence
strongly
year
by
year
the
farmers
who
lived
on
soil
whose
returns
were
diminished
by
unrotated
crops
were
offered
the
virgin
soil
of
the
frontier
at
nominal
prices
their
growing
families
demanded
more
lands
and
these
were
dear
the
competition
of
the
unexhausted
cheap
and
easily
tilled
prairie
lands
compelled
the
farmer
either
to
go
west
and
continue
the
exhaustion
of
the
soil
on
a
new
frontier
or
to
adopt
intensive
culture
thus
the
census
of
shows
in
the
northwest
many
counties
in
which
there
is
an
absolute
or
a
relative
decrease
of
population
these
states
have
been
sending
farmers
to
advance
the
frontier
on
the
plains
and
have
themselves
begun
to
turn
to
intensive
farming
and
to
manufacture
a
decade
before
this
ohio
had
shown
the
same
transition
stage
thus
the
demand
for
land
and
the
love
of
wilderness
freedom
drew
the
frontier
ever
onward
having
now
roughly
outlined
the
various
kinds
of
frontiers
and
their
modes
of
advance
chiefly
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
frontier
itself
we
may
next
inquire
what
were
the
influences
on
the
east
and
on
the
old
world
a
rapid
enumeration
of
some
of
the
more
noteworthy
effects
is
all
that
i
have
time
for
first
we
note
that
the
frontier
promoted
the
formation
of
a
composite
nationality
for
the
american
people
the
coast
was
preponderantly
english
but
the
later
tides
of
continental
immigration
flowed
across
to
the
free
lands
this
was
the
case
from
the
early
colonial
days
the
and
the
palatine
germans
or
pennsylvania
dutch
furnished
the
dominant
element
in
the
stock
of
the
colonial
frontier
with
these
peoples
were
also
the
freed
indented
servants
or
redemptioners
who
at
the
expiration
of
their
time
of
service
passed
to
the
frontier
governor
spotswood
of
virginia
writes
in
the
inhabitants
of
our
frontiers
are
composed
generally
of
such
as
have
been
transported
hither
as
servants
and
being
out
of
their
time
settle
themselves
where
land
is
to
be
taken
up
and
that
will
produce
the
necessarys
of
life
with
little
labour
very
generally
these
redemptioners
were
of
stock
in
the
crucible
of
the
frontier
the
immigrants
were
americanized
liberated
and
fused
into
a
mixed
race
english
in
neither
nationality
nor
characteristics
the
process
has
gone
on
from
the
early
days
to
our
own
burke
and
other
writers
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
believed
that
pennsylvania
was
threatened
with
the
danger
of
being
wholly
foreign
in
language
manners
and
perhaps
even
inclinations
the
german
and
elements
in
the
frontier
of
the
south
were
only
less
great
in
the
middle
of
the
present
century
the
german
element
in
wisconsin
was
already
so
considerable
that
leading
publicists
looked
to
the
creation
of
a
german
state
out
of
the
commonwealth
by
concentrating
their
colonization
such
examples
teach
us
to
beware
of
misinterpreting
the
fact
that
there
is
a
common
english
speech
in
america
into
a
belief
that
the
stock
is
also
english
in
another
way
the
advance
of
the
frontier
decreased
our
dependence
on
england
the
coast
particularly
of
the
south
lacked
diversified
industries
and
was
dependent
on
england
for
the
bulk
of
its
supplies
in
the
south
there
was
even
a
dependence
on
the
northern
colonies
for
articles
of
food
governor
glenn
of
south
carolina
writes
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
our
trade
with
new
york
and
philadelphia
was
of
this
sort
draining
us
of
all
the
little
money
and
bills
we
could
gather
from
other
places
for
their
bread
flour
beer
hams
bacon
and
other
things
of
their
produce
all
which
except
beer
our
new
townships
begin
to
supply
us
with
which
are
settled
with
very
industrious
and
thriving
germans
this
no
doubt
diminishes
the
number
of
shipping
and
the
appearance
of
our
trade
but
it
is
far
from
being
a
detriment
to
us
before
long
the
frontier
created
a
demand
for
merchants
as
it
retreated
from
the
coast
it
became
less
and
less
possible
for
england
to
bring
her
supplies
directly
to
the
consumer
wharfs
and
carry
away
staple
crops
and
staple
crops
began
to
give
way
to
diversified
agriculture
for
a
time
the
effect
of
this
phase
of
the
frontier
action
upon
the
northern
section
is
perceived
when
we
realize
how
the
advance
of
the
frontier
aroused
seaboard
cities
like
boston
new
york
and
baltimore
to
engage
in
rivalry
for
what
washington
called
the
extensive
and
valuable
trade
of
a
rising
empire
the
legislation
which
most
developed
the
powers
of
the
national
government
and
played
the
largest
part
in
its
activity
was
conditioned
on
the
frontier
writers
have
discussed
the
subjects
of
tariff
land
and
internal
improvement
as
subsidiary
to
the
slavery
question
but
when
american
history
comes
to
be
rightly
viewed
it
will
be
seen
that
the
slavery
question
is
an
incident
in
the
period
from
the
end
of
the
first
half
of
the
present
century
to
the
close
of
the
civil
war
slavery
rose
to
primary
but
far
from
exclusive
importance
but
this
does
not
justify
von
holst
to
take
an
example
in
treating
our
constitutional
history
in
its
formative
period
down
to
in
a
single
volume
giving
six
volumes
chiefly
to
the
history
of
slavery
from
to
under
the
title
constitutional
history
of
the
united
states
the
growth
of
nationalism
and
the
evolution
of
american
political
institutions
were
dependent
on
the
advance
of
the
frontier
even
so
recent
a
writer
as
rhodes
in
his
history
of
the
united
states
since
the
compromise
of
has
treated
the
legislation
called
out
by
the
western
advance
as
incidental
to
the
slavery
struggle
this
is
a
wrong
perspective
the
pioneer
needed
the
goods
of
the
coast
and
so
the
grand
series
of
internal
improvement
and
railroad
legislation
began
with
potent
nationalizing
effects
over
internal
improvements
occurred
great
debates
in
which
grave
constitutional
questions
were
discussed
sectional
groupings
appear
in
the
votes
profoundly
significant
for
the
historian
loose
construction
increased
as
the
nation
marched
westward
but
the
west
was
not
content
with
bringing
the
farm
to
the
factory
under
the
lead
of
clay
harry
of
the
west
protective
tariffs
were
passed
with
the
cry
of
bringing
the
factory
to
the
farm
the
disposition
of
the
public
lands
was
a
third
important
subject
of
national
legislation
influenced
by
the
frontier
the
public
domain
has
been
a
force
of
profound
importance
in
the
nationalization
and
development
of
the
government
the
effects
of
the
struggle
of
the
landed
and
the
landless
states
and
of
the
ordinance
of
need
no
discussion
administratively
the
frontier
called
out
some
of
the
highest
and
most
vitalizing
activities
of
the
general
government
the
purchase
of
louisiana
was
perhaps
the
constitutional
turning
point
in
the
history
of
the
republic
inasmuch
as
it
afforded
both
a
new
area
for
national
legislation
and
the
occasion
of
the
downfall
of
the
policy
of
strict
construction
but
the
purchase
of
louisiana
was
called
out
by
frontier
needs
and
demands
as
frontier
states
accrued
to
the
union
the
national
power
grew
in
a
speech
on
the
dedication
of
the
calhoun
monument
lamar
explained
in
the
states
were
the
creators
of
the
federal
government
in
the
federal
government
was
the
creator
of
a
large
majority
of
the
states
when
we
consider
the
public
domain
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
sale
and
disposal
of
the
public
lands
we
are
again
brought
face
to
face
with
the
frontier
the
policy
of
the
united
states
in
dealing
with
its
lands
is
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
european
system
of
scientific
administration
efforts
to
make
this
domain
a
source
of
revenue
and
to
withhold
it
from
emigrants
in
order
that
settlement
might
be
compact
were
in
vain
the
jealousy
and
the
fears
of
the
east
were
powerless
in
the
face
of
the
demands
of
the
frontiersmen
john
quincy
adams
was
obliged
to
confess
my
own
system
of
administration
which
was
to
make
the
national
domain
the
inexhaustible
fund
for
progressive
and
unceasing
internal
improvement
has
failed
the
reason
is
obvious
a
system
of
administration
was
not
what
the
west
demanded
it
wanted
land
adams
states
the
situation
as
follows
the
slaveholders
of
the
south
have
bought
the
coöperation
of
the
western
country
by
the
bribe
of
the
western
lands
abandoning
to
the
new
western
states
their
own
proportion
of
the
public
property
and
aiding
them
in
the
design
of
grasping
all
the
lands
into
their
own
hands
thomas
benton
was
the
author
of
this
system
which
he
brought
forward
as
a
substitute
for
the
american
system
of
clay
and
to
supplant
him
as
the
leading
statesman
of
the
west
clay
by
his
tariff
compromise
with
calhoun
abandoned
his
own
american
system
at
the
same
time
he
brought
forward
a
plan
for
distributing
among
all
the
states
of
the
union
the
proceeds
of
the
sales
of
the
public
lands
his
bill
for
that
purpose
passed
both
houses
of
congress
but
was
vetoed
by
president
jackson
who
in
his
annual
message
of
december
formally
recommended
that
all
public
lands
should
be
gratuitously
given
away
to
individual
adventurers
and
to
the
states
in
which
the
lands
are
situated
no
subject
said
henry
clay
which
has
presented
itself
to
the
present
or
perhaps
any
preceding
congress
is
of
greater
magnitude
than
that
of
the
public
lands
when
we
consider
the
effects
of
the
government
land
policy
upon
political
economic
and
social
aspects
of
american
life
we
are
disposed
to
agree
with
him
but
this
legislation
was
framed
under
frontier
influences
and
under
the
lead
of
western
statesmen
like
benton
and
jackson
said
senator
scott
of
indiana
in
i
consider
the
preëmption
law
merely
declaratory
of
the
custom
or
common
law
of
the
settlers
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
legislation
with
regard
to
land
tariff
and
internal
improvements
the
american
system
of
the
nationalizing
whig
party
was
conditioned
on
frontier
ideas
and
needs
but
it
was
not
merely
in
legislative
action
that
the
frontier
worked
against
the
sectionalism
of
the
coast
the
economic
and
social
characteristics
of
the
frontier
worked
against
sectionalism
the
men
of
the
frontier
had
closer
resemblances
to
the
middle
region
than
to
either
of
the
other
sections
pennsylvania
had
been
the
of
frontier
emigration
and
although
she
passed
on
her
settlers
along
the
great
valley
into
the
west
of
virginia
and
the
carolinas
yet
the
industrial
society
of
these
southern
frontiersmen
was
always
more
like
that
of
the
middle
region
than
like
that
of
the
portion
of
the
south
which
later
came
to
spread
its
industrial
type
throughout
the
south
the
middle
region
entered
by
new
york
harbor
was
an
open
door
to
all
europe
the
part
of
the
south
represented
typical
englishmen
modified
by
a
warm
climate
and
servile
labor
and
living
in
baronial
fashion
on
great
plantations
new
england
stood
for
a
special
english
movement
puritanism
the
middle
region
was
less
english
than
the
other
sections
it
had
a
wide
mixture
of
nationalities
a
varied
society
the
mixed
town
and
county
system
of
local
government
a
varied
economic
life
many
religious
sects
in
short
it
was
a
region
mediating
between
new
england
and
the
south
and
the
east
and
the
west
it
represented
that
composite
nationality
which
the
contemporary
united
states
exhibits
that
juxtaposition
of
groups
occupying
a
valley
or
a
little
settlement
and
presenting
reflections
of
the
map
of
europe
in
their
variety
it
was
democratic
and
nonsectional
if
not
national
easy
tolerant
and
contented
rooted
strongly
in
material
prosperity
it
was
typical
of
the
modern
united
states
it
was
least
sectional
not
only
because
it
lay
between
north
and
south
but
also
because
with
no
barriers
to
shut
out
its
frontiers
from
its
settled
region
and
with
a
system
of
connecting
waterways
the
middle
region
mediated
between
east
and
west
as
well
as
between
north
and
south
thus
it
became
the
typically
american
region
even
the
new
englander
who
was
shut
out
from
the
frontier
by
the
middle
region
tarrying
in
new
york
or
pennsylvania
on
his
westward
march
lost
the
acuteness
of
his
sectionalism
on
the
way
the
spread
of
cotton
culture
into
the
interior
of
the
south
finally
broke
down
the
contrast
between
the
region
and
the
rest
of
the
state
and
based
southern
interests
on
slavery
before
this
process
revealed
its
results
the
western
portion
of
the
south
which
was
akin
to
pennsylvania
in
stock
society
and
industry
showed
tendencies
to
fall
away
from
the
faith
of
the
fathers
into
internal
improvement
legislation
and
nationalism
in
the
virginia
convention
of
called
to
revise
the
constitution
leigh
of
chesterfield
one
of
the
counties
declared
one
of
the
main
causes
of
discontent
which
led
to
this
convention
that
which
had
the
strongest
influence
in
overcoming
our
veneration
for
the
work
of
our
fathers
which
taught
us
to
contemn
the
sentiments
of
henry
and
mason
and
pendleton
which
weaned
us
from
our
reverence
for
the
constituted
authorities
of
the
state
was
an
overweening
passion
for
internal
improvement
i
say
this
with
perfect
knowledge
for
it
has
been
avowed
to
me
by
gentlemen
from
the
west
over
and
over
again
and
let
me
tell
the
gentleman
from
albemarle
gordon
that
it
has
been
another
principal
object
of
those
who
set
this
ball
of
revolution
in
motion
to
overturn
the
doctrine
of
state
rights
of
which
virginia
has
been
the
very
pillar
and
to
remove
the
barrier
she
has
interposed
to
the
interference
of
the
federal
government
in
that
same
work
of
internal
improvement
by
so
reorganizing
the
legislature
that
virginia
too
may
be
hitched
to
the
federal
car
it
was
this
nationalizing
tendency
of
the
west
that
transformed
the
democracy
of
jefferson
into
the
national
republicanism
of
monroe
and
the
democracy
of
andrew
jackson
the
west
of
the
war
of
the
west
of
clay
and
benton
and
harrison
and
andrew
jackson
shut
off
by
the
middle
states
and
the
mountains
from
the
coast
sections

a
solidarity
of
its
own
with
national
tendencies
on
the
tide
of
the
father
of
waters
north
and
south
met
and
mingled
into
a
nation
interstate
migration
went
steadily
on
a
process
of
of
ideas
and
institutions
the
fierce
struggle
of
the
sections
over
slavery
on
the
western
frontier
does
not
diminish
the
truth
of
this
statement
it
proves
the
truth
of
it
slavery
was
a
sectional
trait
that
would
not
down
but
in
the
west
it
could
not
remain
sectional
it
was
the
greatest
of
frontiersmen
who
declared
i
believe
this
government
can
not
endure
permanently
half
slave
and
half
free
it
will
become
all
of
one
thing
or
all
of
the
other
nothing
works
for
nationalism
like
intercourse
within
the
nation
mobility
of
population
is
death
to
localism
and
the
western
frontier
worked
irresistibly
in
unsettling
population
the
effect
reached
back
from
the
frontier
and
affected
profoundly
the
atlantic
coast
and
even
the
old
world
but
the
most
important
effect
of
the
frontier
has
been
in
the
promotion
of
democracy
here
and
in
europe
as
has
been
indicated
the
frontier
is
productive
of
individualism
complex
society
is
precipitated
by
the
wilderness
into
a
kind
of
primitive
organization
based
on
the
family
the
tendency
is
it
produces
antipathy
to
control
and
particularly
to
any
direct
control
the
is
viewed
as
a
representative
of
oppression
osgood
in
an
able
article
has
pointed
out
that
the
frontier
conditions
prevalent
in
the
colonies
are
important
factors
in
the
explanation
of
the
american
revolution
where
individual
liberty
was
sometimes
confused
with
absence
of
all
effective
government
the
same
conditions
aid
in
explaining
the
difficulty
of
instituting
a
strong
government
in
the
period
of
the
confederacy
the
frontier
individualism
has
from
the
beginning
promoted
democracy
the
frontier
states
that
came
into
the
union
in
the
first
quarter
of
a
century
of
its
existence
came
in
with
democratic
suffrage
provisions
and
had
reactive
effects
of
the
highest
importance
upon
the
older
states
whose
peoples
were
being
attracted
there
an
extension
of
the
franchise
became
essential
it
was
new
york
that
forced
an
extension
of
suffrage
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
that
state
in
and
it
was
virginia
that
compelled
the
region
to
put
a
more
liberal
suffrage
provision
in
the
constitution
framed
in
and
to
give
to
the
frontier
region
a
more
nearly
proportionate
representation
with
the
aristocracy
the
rise
of
democracy
as
an
effective
force
in
the
nation
came
in
with
western
preponderance
under
jackson
and
william
henry
harrison
and
it
meant
the
triumph
of
the
frontier
with
all
of
its
good
and
with
all
of
its
evil
elements
an
interesting
illustration
of
the
tone
of
frontier
democracy
in
comes
from
the
same
debates
in
the
virginia
convention
already
referred
to
a
representative
from
western
virginia
declared
but
sir
it
is
not
the
increase
of
population
in
the
west
which
this
gentleman
ought
to
fear
it
is
the
energy
which
the
mountain
breeze
and
western
habits
impart
to
those
emigrants
they
are
regenerated
politically
i
mean
sir
they
soon
become
and
the
difference
sir
between
a
and
a
politician
is
immense
the
old
dominion
has
long
been
celebrated
for
producing
great
orators
the
ablest
metaphysicians
in
policy
men
that
can
split
hairs
in
all
abstruse
questions
of
political
economy
but
at
home
or
when
they
return
from
congress
they
have
negroes
to
fan
them
asleep
but
a
pennsylvania
a
new
york
an
ohio
or
a
western
virginia
statesman
though
far
inferior
in
logic
metaphysics
and
rhetoric
to
an
old
virginia
statesman
has
this
advantage
that
when
he
returns
home
he
takes
off
his
coat
and
takes
hold
of
the
plow
this
gives
him
bone
and
muscle
sir
and
preserves
his
republican
principles
pure
and
uncontaminated
so
long
as
free
land
exists
the
opportunity
for
a
competency
exists
and
economic
power
secures
political
power
but
the
democracy
born
of
free
land
strong
in
selfishness
and
individualism
intolerant
of
administrative
experience
and
education
and
pressing
individual
liberty
beyond
its
proper
bounds
has
its
dangers
as
well
as
its
benefits
individualism
in
america
has
allowed
a
laxity
in
regard
to
governmental
affairs
which
has
rendered
possible
the
spoils
system
and
all
the
manifest
evils
that
follow
from
the
lack
of
a
highly
developed
civic
spirit
in
this
connection
may
be
noted
also
the
influence
of
frontier
conditions
in
permitting
lax
business
honor
inflated
paper
currency
and
banking
the
colonial
and
revolutionary
frontier
was
the
region
whence
emanated
many
of
the
worst
forms
of
an
evil
currency
the
west
in
the
war
of
repeated
the
phenomenon
on
the
frontier
of
that
day
while
the
speculation
and
banking
of
the
period
of
the
crisis
of
occurred
on
the
new
frontier
belt
of
the
next
tier
of
states
thus
each
one
of
the
periods
of
lax
financial
integrity
coincides
with
periods
when
a
new
set
of
frontier
communities
had
arisen
and
coincides
in
area
with
these
successive
frontiers
for
the
most
part
the
recent
populist
agitation
is
a
case
in
point
many
a
state
that
now
declines
any
connection
with
the
tenets
of
the
populists
itself
adhered
to
such
ideas
in
an
earlier
stage
of
the
development
of
the
state
a
primitive
society
can
hardly
be
expected
to
show
the
intelligent
appreciation
of
the
complexity
of
business
interests
in
a
developed
society
the
continual
recurrence
of
these
areas
of
agitation
is
another
evidence
that
the
frontier
can
be
isolated
and
studied
as
a
factor
in
american
history
of
the
highest
importance
the
east
has
always
feared
the
result
of
an
unregulated
advance
of
the
frontier
and
has
tried
to
check
and
guide
it
the
english
authorities
would
have
checked
settlement
at
the
headwaters
of
the
atlantic
tributaries
and
allowed
the
savages
to
enjoy
their
deserts
in
quiet
lest
the
peltry

should
decrease

places
you
can
not
station

of

attached
to

thence

an

a

of

miles
over
this
they
would
wander
without
a

they
would
change
their
manners
with
their
habits
of
life
would
soon
forget
a
government
by
which
they
were

would
become

masters
of
your
governors
and
your

your

such

line
for
the
limits
of
the

of

tiers
of

complaining
that
the
seaboard
states
were
being
drained
of
the
flower
of
their
population
by
the
bringing
of
too
much
land
into
market
even
thomas
benton
the
man
of
widest
views
of
the
destiny
of
the
west
at
this
stage
of
his
career
declared
that
along
the
ridge
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
western
limits
of
the
republic
should
be
drawn
and
the
statue
of
the
fabled
god
terminus
should
be
raised
upon
its
highest
peak
never
to
be
thrown
down
but
the
attempts
to
limit
the
boundaries
to
restrict
land
sales
and
settlement
and
to
deprive
the
west
of
its
share
of
political
power
were
all
in
vain
steadily
the
frontier
of
settlement
advanced
and
carried
with
it
individualism
democracy
and
nationalism
and
powerfully
affected
the
east
and
the
old
world
the
most
effective
efforts
of
the
east
to
regulate
the
frontier
came
through
its
educational
and
religious
activity
exerted
by
interstate
migration
and
by
organized
societies
speaking
in
lyman
beecher
declared
it
is
equally
plain
that
the
religious
and
political
destiny
of
our
nation
is
to
be
decided
in
the
west
and
he
pointed
out
that
the
population
of
the
west
is
assembled
from
all
the
states
of
the
union
and
from
all
the
nations
of
europe
and
is
rushing
in
like
the
waters
of
the
flood
demanding
for
its
moral
preservation
the
immediate
and
universal
action
of
those
institutions
which
discipline
the
mind
and
arm
the
conscience
and
the
heart
and
so
various
are
the
opinions
and
habits
and
so
recent
and
imperfect
is
the
acquaintance
and
so
sparse
are
the
settlements
of
the
west
that
no
homogeneous
public
sentiment
can
be
formed
to
legislate
immediately
into
being
the
requisite
institutions
and
yet
they
are
all
needed
immediately
in
their
utmost
perfection
and
power
a
nation
is
being
in
a
day
but
what
will
become
of
the
west
if
her
prosperity
rushes
up
to
such
a
majesty
of
power
while
those
great
institutions
linger
which
are
necessary
to
form
the
mind
and
the
conscience
and
the
heart
of
that
vast
world
it
must
not
be
permitted
let
no
man
at
the
east
quiet
himself
and
dream
of
liberty
whatever
may
become
of
the
west
her
destiny
is
our
destiny
with
the
appeal
to
the
conscience
of
new
england
he
adds
appeals
to
her
fears
lest
other
religious
sects
anticipate
her
own
the
new
england
preacher
and
left
their
mark
on
the
west
the
dread
of
western
emancipation
from
new
england
political
and
economic
control
was
paralleled
by
her
fears
lest
the
west
cut
loose
from
her
religion
commenting
in
on
reports
that
settlement
was
rapidly
extending
northward
in
wisconsin
the
editor
of
the
writes
we
scarcely
know
whether
to
rejoice
or
mourn
over
this
extension
of
our
settlements
while
we
sympathize
in
whatever
tends
to
increase
the
physical
resources
and
prosperity
of
our
country
we
can
not
forget
that
with
all
these
dispersions
into
remote
and
still
remoter
corners
of
the
land
the
supply
of
the
means
of
grace
is
becoming
relatively
less
and
less
acting
in
accordance
with
such
ideas
home
missions
were
established
and
western
colleges
were
erected
as
seaboard
cities
like
philadelphia
new
york
and
baltimore
strove
for
the
mastery
of
western
trade
so
the
various
denominations
strove
for
the
possession
of
the
west
thus
an
intellectual
stream
from
new
england
sources
fertilized
the
west
other
sections
sent
their
missionaries
but
the
real
struggle
was
between
sects
the
contest
for
power
and
the
expansive
tendency
furnished
to
the
various
sects
by
the
existence
of
a
moving
frontier
must
have
had
important
results
on
the
character
of
religious
organization
in
the
united
states
the
multiplication
of
rival
churches
in
the
little
frontier
towns
had
deep
and
lasting
social
effects
the
religious
aspects
of
the
frontier
make
a
chapter
in
our
history
which
needs
study
from
the
conditions
of
frontier
life
came
intellectual
traits
of
profound
importance
the
works
of
travelers
along
each
frontier
from
colonial
days
onward
describe
certain
common
traits
and
these
traits
have
while
softening
down
still
persisted
as
survivals
in
the
place
of
their
origin
even
when
a
higher
social
organization
succeeded
the
result
is
that
to
the
frontier
the
american
intellect
owes
its
striking
characteristics
that
coarseness
and
strength
combined
with
acuteness
and
inquisitiveness
that
practical
inventive
turn
of
mind
quick
to
find
expedients
that
masterful
grasp
of
material
things
lacking
in
the
artistic
but
powerful
to
effect
great
ends
that
restless
nervous
energy
that
dominant
individualism
working
for
good
and
for
evil
and
withal
that
buoyancy
and
exuberance
which
comes
with
freedom
these
are
traits
of
the
frontier
or
traits
called
out
elsewhere
because
of
the
existence
of
the
frontier
since
the
days
when
the
fleet
of
columbus
sailed
into
the
waters
of
the
new
world
america
has
been
another
name
for
opportunity
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
taken
their
tone
from
the
incessant
expansion
which
has
not
only
been
open
but
has
even
been
forced
upon
them
he
would
be
a
rash
prophet
who
should
assert
that
the
expansive
character
of
american
life
has
now
entirely
ceased
movement
has
been
its
dominant
fact
and
unless
this
training
has
no
effect
upon
a
people
the
american
energy
will
continually
demand
a
wider
field
for
its
exercise
but
never
again
will
such
gifts
of
free
land
offer
themselves
for
a
moment
at
the
frontier
the
bonds
of
custom
are
broken
and
unrestraint
is
triumphant
there
is
not
the
stubborn
american
environment
is
there
with
its
imperious
summons
to
accept
its
conditions
the
inherited
ways
of
doing
things
are
also
there
and
yet
in
spite
of
environment
and
in
spite
of
custom
each
frontier
did
indeed
furnish
a
new
field
of
opportunity
a
gate
of
escape
from
the
bondage
of
the
past
and
freshness
and
confidence
and
scorn
of
older
society
impatience
of
its
restraints
and
its
ideas
and
indifference
to
its
lessons
have
accompanied
the
frontier
what
the
mediterranean
sea
was
to
the
greeks
breaking
the
bond
of
custom
offering
new
experiences
calling
out
new
institutions
and
activities
that
and
more
the
ever
retreating
frontier
has
been
to
the
united
states
directly
and
to
the
nations
of
europe
more
remotely
and
now
four
centuries
from
the
discovery
of
america
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
years
of

took
for
my
text
the
following
announcement
of
the
superintendent
of
the
census
of
up
to
and
including
the
country
had
a
frontier
of
settlement
but
at
present
the
unsettled
area
has
been
so
broken
into
by
isolated
bodies
of
settlement
that
there
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
a
frontier
line
in
the
discussion
of
its
extent
the
westward
movement
it
can
not
therefore
any
longer
have
a
place
in
the
census
reports
two
centuries
prior
to
this
announcement
in
a
committee
of
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
recommended
the
court
to
order
what
shall
be
the
frontier
and
to
maintain
a
committee
to
settle
garrisons
on
the
frontier
with
forty
soldiers
to
each
frontier
town
as
a
main
guard
in
the
two
hundred
years
between
this
official
attempt
to
locate
the
massachusetts
frontier
line
and
the
official
announcement
of
the
ending
of
the
national
frontier
line
westward
expansion
was
the
most
important
single
process
in
american
history
the
designation
frontier
town
was
not
however
a
new
one
as
early
as
inhabitants
of
concord
sudbury
and
dedham
being
inland
townes
but
thinly
peopled
were
forbidden
to
remove
without
authority
in
certain
towns
had
been
the
subject
of
legislation
as
frontier
towns
and
in
the
period
of
king
philip
war
there
were
various
enactments
regarding
frontier
towns
in
the
session
of
it
had
been
proposed
to
build
a
fence
of
stockades
or
stone
eight
feet
high
from
the
charles
where
it
is
navigable
to
the
concord
at
billerica
and
thence
to
the
merrimac
and
down
the
river
to
the
bay
by
which
meanes
that
whole
tract
will
be
environed
for
the
security
safty
vnder
god
of
the
people
their
houses
goods
cattel
from
the
rage
fury
of
the
enimy
this
project
however
of
a
kind
of
roman
wall
did
not
appeal
to
the
frontiersmen
of
the
time
it
was
a
part
of
the
antiquated
ideas
of
defense
which
had
been
illustrated
by
the
impossible
equipment
of
the
heavily
armored
soldier
of
the
early
puritan
régime
whose
corslets
and
head
pieces
pikes
matchlocks
fourquettes
and
bandoleers
went
out
of
use
about
the
period
of
king
philip
war
the
postures
provided
in
the
approved
manual
of
arms
for
loading
and
firing
the
matchlock
proved
too
great
a
handicap
in
the
chase
of
the
nimble
savage
in
this
era
the
frontier
fighter
adapted
himself
to
a
more
open
order
and
lighter
equipment
suggested
by
the
indian
practice
the
settler
on
the
outskirts
of
puritan
civilization
took
up
the
task
of
bearing
the
brunt
of
attack
and
pushing
forward
the
line
of
advance
which
year
after
year
carried
american
settlements
into
the
wilderness
in
american
thought
and
speech
the
term
frontier
has
come
to
mean
the
edge
of
settlement
rather
than
as
in
europe
the
political
boundary
by
it
was
already
evident
that
the
frontier
of
settlement
and
the
frontier
of
military
defense
were
coinciding
as
population
advanced
into
the
wilderness
and
thus
successively
brought
new
exposed
areas
between
the
settlements
on
the
one
side
and
the
indians
with
their
european
backers
on
the
other
the
military
frontier
ceased
to
be
thought
of
as
the
atlantic
coast
but
rather
as
a
moving
line
bounding
the
wilderness
it
could
not
be
a
fortified
boundary
along
the
charter
limits
for
those
limits
extended
to
the
south
sea
and
conflicted
with
the
bounds
of
sister
colonies
the
thing
to
be
defended
was
the
outer
edge
of
this
expanding
society
a
changing
frontier
one
that
needed
designation
and
with
the
changing
location
of
the
west
it
will
help
to
illustrate
the
significance
of
this
new
frontier
when
we
see
that
virginia
at
about
the
same
time
as
massachusetts
underwent
a
similar
change
and
attempted
to
establish
frontier
towns
or
at
the
heads
that
is
the
first
falls
the
vicinity
of
richmond
petersburg
of
her
rivers
the
virginia
system
of
particular
plantations
introduced
along
the
james
at
the
close
of
the
london
company
activity
had
furnished
a
type
for
the
new
england
town
in
recompense
at
this
later
day
the
new
england
town
may
have
furnished
a
model
for
virginia
efforts
to
create
frontier
settlements
by
legislation
an
act
of
march
by
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
enumerated
the
frontier
towns
which
the
inhabitants
were
forbidden
to
desert
on
pain
of
loss
of
their
lands
if
landholders
or
of
imprisonment
if
not
landholders
unless
permission
to
remove
were
first
obtained
these
eleven
frontier
towns
included
wells
york
and
kittery
on
the
eastern
frontier
and
amesbury
haverhill
dunstable
chelmsford
groton
lancaster
marlborough
and
deerfield
in
march
the
law
was
reënacted
with
the
addition
of
brookfield
mendon
and
woodstock
together
with
seven
others
salisbury
andover
billerica
hatfield
hadley
westfield
and
northampton
which
tho
they
be
not
frontiers
as
those
towns
first
named
yet
lye
more
open
than
many
others
to
an
attack
of
an
enemy
in
the
spring
of
the
general
court
of
connecticut
following
closely
the
act
of
massachusetts
named
as
her
frontier
towns
not
to
be
deserted
symsbury
waterbury
danbury
colchester
windham
mansfield
and
plainfield
thus
about
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
was
an
officially
designated
frontier
line
for
new
england
the
line
passing
through
these
enumerated
towns
represents
the
outskirts
of
settlement
along
the
eastern
coast
and
up
the
merrimac
and
its
tributaries
a
region
threatened
from
the
indian
country
by
way
of
the
winnepesaukee
lake
the
end
of
the
ribbon
of

up
the
connecticut
valley

by
the
canadian
indians
by

route
to
the
connecticut
boundary
towns
which
marked
the
edges
of
that
inferior
agricultural
region
where
the
hard
crystalline
rocks
furnished
a
later
foundation
for
shays
rebellion
opposition
to
the
adoption
of
the
federal
constitution
and
the
abandoned
farm
and
the
isolated
intervale
of
brookfield
which
lay
intermediate
between
these
frontiers
besides
this
new
england
frontier
there
was
a
belt
of
settlement
in
new
york
ascending
the
hudson
to
where
albany
and
schenectady
served
as
outposts
against
the
five
nations
who
menaced
the
mohawk
and
against
the
french
and
the
canadian
indians
who
threatened
the
hudson
by

of

sinister
relations
of
leading
citizens
of

engaged
in

common
sequence
of
frontier
types
fur
trader
pioneer
small
primitive
farmer
and
the
farmer
engaged
in
intensive
varied
agriculture
to
produce
a
surplus
for
export
had
appeared
though
confusedly
in
new
england
the
traders
and
their
posts
had
prepared
the
way
for
the
frontier
towns
and
the
cattle
industry
was
most
important
to
the
early
farmers
but
the
stages
succeeded
rapidly
and
intermingled
after
king
philip
war
while
albany
was
still
in
the
stage
the
new
england
frontier
towns
were
rather
like
mark
colonies
outposts
against
the
indian
enemy
the
story
of
the
border
warfare
between
canada
and
the
frontier
towns
furnishes
ample
material
for
studying
frontier
life
and
institutions
but
i
shall
not
attempt
to
deal
with
the
narrative
of
the
wars
the
palisaded
square
the
fortified
isolated
garrison
houses
the
massacres
and
captivities
are
familiar
features
of
new
history
the
indian
was
a
very
real
influence
upon
the
mind
and
morals
as
well
as
upon
the
institutions
of
frontier
new
england
the
occasional
instances
of
puritans
returning
from
captivity
to
visit
the
frontier
towns
catholic
in
religion
painted
and
garbed
as
indians
and
speaking
the
indian
tongue
and
the
children
of
captive
puritan
mothers
tell
a
sensational
part
of
the
story
but
in
the
normal
as
well
as
in
such
exceptional
relations
of
the
frontier
townsmen
to
the
indians
there
are
clear
evidences
of
the
transforming
influence
of
the
indian
frontier
upon
the
puritan
type
of
english
colonist
in
for
example
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
ordered
five
hundred
pairs
of
snowshoes
and
an
equal
number
of
moccasins
for
use
in
specified
counties
lying
frontier
next
to
the
wilderness
connecticut
in
after
referring
to
her
frontier
towns
and
garrisons
ordered
that
said
company
of
english
and
indians
shall
from
time
to
time
at
the
discretion
of
their
chief
co
ander
range
the
woods
to
indevour
the
discovery
of
an
approaching
enemy
and
in
especiall
manner
from
westfield
to
ousatunnuck
and
for
the
incouragement
of
our
forces
gone
or
going
against
the
enemy
this
court
will
allow
out
of
the
publick
treasurie
the
su
e
of
five
pounds
for
every
mans
scalp
of
the
enemy
killed
in
this
colonie
massachusetts
offered
bounties
for
scalps
varying
in
amount
according
to
whether
the
scalp
was
of
men
or
women
and
youths
and
whether
it
was
taken
by
regular
forces
under
pay
volunteers
in
service
or
volunteers
without
pay
one
of
the
most
striking
phases
of
frontier
adjustment
was
the
proposal
of
the
rev
solomon
stoddard
of
northampton
in
the
fall
of
urging
the
use
of
dogs
to
hunt
indians
as
they
do
bears
the
argument
was
that
the
dogs
would
catch
many
an
indian
who
would
be
too
light
of
foot
for
the
townsmen
nor
was
it
to
be
thought
of
as
inhuman
for
the
indians
act
like
wolves
and
are
to
be
dealt
with
as
wolves
in
fact
massachusetts
passed
an
act
in
for
the
raising
and
increasing
of
dogs
for
the
better
security
of
the
frontiers
and
both
massachusetts
and
connecticut
in
paid
money
from
their
treasury
for
the
trailing
of
dogs
thus
we
come
to
familiar
ground
the
massachusetts
frontiersman
like
his
western
successor
hated
the
indians
the
tawney
serpents
of
cotton
mather
phrase
were
to
be
hunted
down
and
scalped
in
accord
with
law
and
in
at
least
one
instance
by
the
chaplain
himself
a
harvard
graduate
the
hero
of
the
ballad
of
pigwacket
who
many
indians
slew
and
some
of
them
he
scalp
when
bullets
round
him
flew
within
the
area
bounded
by
the
frontier
line
were
the
broken
fragments
of
indians
defeated
in
the
era
of
king
philip
war
restrained
within
reservations
drunken
and
degenerate
survivors
among
whom
the
missionaries
worked
with
small
results
a
vexation
to
the
border
towns
as
they
were
in
the
case
of
later
frontiers
although
as
has
been
said
the
frontier
towns
had
scattered
garrison
houses
and
palisaded
enclosures
similar
to
the
neighborhood
forts
or
stations
of
kentucky
in
the
revolution
and
of
indiana
and
illinois
in
the
war
of
one
difference
is
particularly
noteworthy
in
the
case
of
frontiersmen
who
came
down
from
pennsylvania
into
the
upland
south
along
the
eastern
edge
of
the
alleghanies
as
well
as
in
the
more
obvious
case
of
the
backwoodsmen
of
kentucky
and
tennessee
the
frontier
towns
were
too
isolated
from
the
main
settled
regions
to
allow
much
military
protection
by
the
older
areas
on
the
new
england
frontier
because
it
was
adjacent
to
the
coast
towns
this
was
not
the
case
and
here
as
in
seventeenth
century
virginia
great
activity
in
protecting
the
frontier
was
evinced
by
the
colonial
authorities
and
the
frontier
towns
themselves
called
loudly
for
assistance
this
phase
of
frontier
defense
needs
a
special
study
but
at
present
it
is
sufficient
to
recall
that
the
colony
sent
garrisons
to
the
frontier
besides
using
the
militia
of
the
frontier
towns
and
that
it
employed
rangers
to
patrol
from
garrison
to
garrison
these
were
prototypes
of
the
regular
army
post
and
of
rangers
dragoons
cavalry
and
mounted
police
who
have
carried
the
remoter
military
frontier
forward
it
is
possible
to
trace
this
military
cordon
from
new
england
to
the
carolinas
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
still
neighboring
the
coast
by
it
ran
from
fort
snelling
on
the
upper
mississippi
through
various
posts
to
the
sabine
boundary
of
texas
and
so
it
passed
forward
until
it
lies
at
the
edge
of
mexico
and
the
pacific
ocean
a
few
examples
of
frontier
appeals
for
garrison
aid
will
help
to
an
understanding
of
the
early
form
of
the
military
frontier

suddainly
to
breathe
out
o
r
last
breath
the
perils
of
the
time
the
hardships
of
the
frontier
towns
and
readiness
of
this
particular
frontier
to
ask
appropriations
for
losses
and
wounds
are
abundantly
illustrated
in
similar
petitions
from
other
towns
one
is
tempted
at
times
to
attribute
the
very
frank
and
dependent
attitude
to
a
minister
phrasing
and
to
the
desire
to
secure
remission
of
taxes
the
latter
a
frontier
trait
more
often
associated
with
riot
than
with
religion
in
other
regions
as
an
example
of
various
petitions
the
following

forced

getting

at

peril
of

the
frontier
townsmen
felt
it
a
hardship
to
contribute
also
to
the
taxes
of
the
province
while
they
helped
to
protect
the
exposed
frontier
in
addition
there
were
grievances
of
absentee
proprietors
who
paid
no
town
taxes
and
yet
profited
by
the
exertions
of
the
frontiersmen
of
that
i
shall
speak
later
if
we
were
to
trust
to
these
petitions
asking
favors
from
the
government
of
the
colony
we
might
impute
to
these
early
frontiersmen
a
degree
of
submission
to
authority
unlike
that
of
other
frontiersmen
and
indeed
not
wholly
warranted
by
the
facts
reading
carefully
we
find
that
however
prudently
phrased
the
petitions
are
in
fact
complaints
against
taxation
demands
for
expenditures
by
the
colony
in
their
behalf
criticisms
of
absentee
proprietors
intimations
that
they
may
be
forced
to
abandon
the
frontier
position
so
essential
to
the
defense
of
the
settled
eastern
country
the
spirit
of
military
insubordination
characteristic
of
the
frontier
is
evident
in
the
accounts
of
these
towns
such
as
pynchon
in
complaining
of
the
decay
of
the
fortifications
at
hatfield
hadley
and
springfield
the
people
a
little
wilful
inclined
to
doe
when
and
how
they
please
or
not
at
all
saltonstall
writes
from
haverhill
about
the
same
time
regarding
his
ill
success
in
recruiting
i
will
never
plead
for
an
haverhill
man
more
and
he
begs
that
some
meet
person
be
sent
to
tell
us
what
we
should
may
or
must
do
i
have
laboured
in
vain
some
go
this
and
that
and
the
other
way
at
pleasure
and
do
what
they
list
this
has
a
familiar
ring
to
the
student
of
the
frontier
as
in
the
case
of
the
later
frontier
also
the
existence
of
a
common
danger
on
the
borders
of
settlement
tended
to
consolidate
not
only
the
towns
of
massachusetts
into
united
action
for
defense
but
also
the
various
colonies
the
frontier
was
an
incentive
to
sectional
combination
then
as
it
was
to
nationalism
afterward
when
in
connecticut
sent
soldiers
from
her
own
colony
to
aid
the
massachusetts
towns
on
the
connecticut
river
she
showed
a
realization
that
the
deerfield
people
who
were
in
a
sense
in
the
enemy
mouth
almost
as
pynchon
wrote
constituted
her
own
frontier
and
that
the
facts
of
geography
were
more
compelling
than
arbitrary
colonial
boundaries
thereby
she
also
took
a
step
that
helped
to
break
down
provincial
antagonisms
when
in
massachusetts
and
connecticut
sent
agents
to
albany
to
join
with
new
york
in
making
presents
to
the
indians
of
that
colony
in
order
to
engage
their
aid
against
the
french
they
recognized
as
their
leaders
put
it
that
albany
was
the
hinge
of
the
frontier
in
this
exposed
quarter
in
thanking
connecticut
for
the
assistance
furnished
in
livingston
said
i
hope
your
honors
do
not
look
upon
albany
as
albany
but
as
the
frontier
of
your
honor
colony
and
of
all
their
majesties
countries
the
very
essence
of
the
american
frontier
is
that
it
is
the
graphic
line
which
records
the
expansive
energies
of
the
people
behind
it
and
which
by
the
law
of
its
own
being
continually
draws
that
advance
after
it
to
new
conquests
this
is
one
of
the
most
significant
things
about
new
england
frontier
in
these
years
that
long
line
of
the
eastern
frontier
which
skirted
the
maine
coast
was
of
great
importance
for
it
imparted
a
western
tone
to
the
life
and
characteristics
of
the
maine
people
which
endures
to
this
day
and
it
was
one
line
of
advance
for
new
england
toward
the
mouth
of
the
lawrence
leading
again
and
again
to
diplomatic
negotiations
with
the
powers
that
held
that
river
the
line
of
the
towns
that
occupied
the
waters
of
the
merrimac
tempted
the
province
continually
into
the
wilderness
of
new
hampshire
the
connecticut
river
towns
pressed
steadily
up
that
stream
along
its
tributaries
into
the
hoosatonic
valleys
and
into
the
valleys
between
the
green
mountains
of
vermont
by
the
end
of
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
enacted
that
it
will
be
of
great
service
to
all
the
western
frontiers
both
in
this
and
the
neighboring
government
of
to
build
a
block
house
above
northfield
in
the
most
convenient
place
on
the
lands
called
the
equivilant
lands
to
post
in
it
forty
able
men
english
western
indians
to
be
employed
in
scouting
at
a
good
distance
up
river
west
river
otter
creek
and
sometimes
eastwardly
above
the
great
manadnuck
for
the
discovery
of
the
enemy
coming
towards
anny
of
the
frontier
towns
the
frontier
towns
were
preparing
to
swarm
it
was
not
long
before
fort
dummer
replaced
the
block
house
and
the
berkshires
and
vermont
became
new
frontiers
the
hudson
river
likewise
was
recognized
as
another
line
of
advance
pointing
the
way
to
lake
champlain
and
montreal
calling
out
demands
that
protection
should
be
secured
by
means
of
an
aggressive
advance
of
the
frontier
delenda
became
the
rallying
cry
in
new
england
as
well
as
in
new
york
and
combined
diplomatic
pressure
and
military
expeditions
followed
in
the
french
and
indian
wars
and
in
the
revolution
in
which
the
children
of
the
connecticut
and
massachusetts
frontier
towns
acclimated
to
indian
fighting
followed
ethan
allen
and
his
fellows
to
the
north
having
touched
upon
some
of
the
military
and
expansive
tendencies
of
this
first
official
frontier
let
us
next
turn
to
its
social
economic
and
political
aspects
how
far
was
this
first
frontier
a
field
for
the
investment
of
eastern
capital
and
for
political
control
by
it
were
there
evidences
of
antagonism
between
the
frontier
and
the
settled
classes
of
the
coast
restless
democracy
resentfulness
over
taxation
and
control
and
recriminations
between
the
western
pioneer
and
the
eastern
capitalist
have
been
characteristic
features
of
other
frontiers
were
similar
phenomena
in
evidence
here
did
populistic
tendencies
appear
in
this
frontier
and
were
there
grievances
which
explained
these
tendencies
in
such
colonies
as
new
york
and
virginia
the
land
grants
were
often
made
to
members
of
the
council
and
their
influential
friends
even
when
there
were
actual
settlers
already
on
the
grants
in
the
case
of
new
england
the
land
system
is
usually
so
described
as
to
give
the
impression
that
it
was
based
on
a
policy
creating
new
puritan
towns
by
free
grants
of
land
made
in
advance
to
approved
settlers
this
description
does
not
completely
fit
the
case
that
there
was
an
economic
interest
on
the
part
of
absentee
proprietors
and
that
men
of
political
influence
with
the
government
were
often
among
the
grantees
seems
also
to
be
true
melville
egleston
states
the
case
thus
the
court
was
careful
not
to
authorize
new
plantations
unless
they
were
to
be
in
a
measure
under
the
influence
of
men
in
whom
confidence
could
be
placed
and
commonly
acted
upon
their
application
the
frontier
as
we
shall
observe
later
was
not
always
disposed
to
see
the
practice
in
so
favorable
a
light
new
towns
seem
to
have
been
the
result
in
some
cases
of
the
aggregation
of
settlers
upon
and
about
a
large
private
grant
more
often
they
resulted
from
settlers
in
older
towns
where
the
town
limits
were
extensive
spreading
out
to
the
good
lands
of
the
outskirts
beyond
easy
access
to
the
and
then
asking
recognition
as
a
separate
town
in
some
cases
they
may
have
been
due
to
squatting
on
unassigned
lands
or
purchasing
the
indian
title
and
then
asking
confirmation
in
others
grants
were
made
in
advance
of
settlement
as
early
as
the
general
court
had
ordered
that
none
go
to
new
plantations
without
leave
of
a
majority
of
the
magistrates
this
made
the
legal
situation
clear
but
it
would
be
dangerous
to
conclude
that
it
represented
the
actual
situation
in
any
case
there
would
be
a
necessity
for
the
settlers
finally
to
secure
the
assent
of
the
court
this
could
be
facilitated
by
a
grant
to
leading
men
having
political
influence
with
the
magistrates
the
complaints
of
absentee
proprietors
which
find
expression
in
the
frontier
petitions
of
the
seventeenth
and
early
eighteenth
century
seems
to
indicate
that
this
happened
in
the
succeeding
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
grants
to
leading
men
and
the
economic
and
political
motives
in
the
grants
are
increasingly
evident
this
whole
topic
should
be
made
the
subject
of
special
study
what
is
here
offered
is
merely
suggestive
of
a
problem
the
frontier
settlers
criticized
the
absentee
proprietors
who
profited
by
the
pioneers
expenditure
of
labor
and
blood
upon
their
farms
while
they
themselves
enjoyed
security
in
an
eastern
town
a
few
examples
from
town
historians
will
illustrate
this
among
the
towns
of
the
merrimac
valley
salisbury
was
planted
on
the
basis
of
a
grant
to
a
dozen
proprietors
including
such
men
as
bradstreet
and
the
younger
dudley
only
two
of
whom
actually
lived
and
died
in
salisbury

by

one
half
of

large

about
by
a
combination
of

was
one
to
the
ancient
and

by

in
to
sue

in

and
in

did
lancaster
nashaway
was
granted
to
proprietors
including
various

perhaps
an
expectation
of

and
few
of

actually

the

yet
they
have
gone
outside
of
their
strength
unless
others
who
are
proprietors
as
well
as
ourselves
the
price
of
whose
lands
is
much
raysed
by
our
carrying
on
public
work
will
be
nothing
worth

half
of

our

say
they
object
that
they
see
no
reason
why
they
should
pay
as
much
for

as
we
do
for
our

we
answer
that
if

of
reason
for
it
we
are
sure
there
is
more
than
enough
of
necessity
to
supply
that
is
wanting
in

this
is
the
authentic
voice
of
the
frontier
deerfield
furnishes
another
type
inasmuch
as
a
considerable
part
of
its
land
was
first
held
by
dedham
to
which
the
grant
was
made
as
a
recompense
for
the
location
of
the
natick
indian
reservation
dedham
shares
in
the
town
often
fell
into
the
hands
of
speculators
and
sheldon
the
careful
historian
of
deerfield
declares
that
not
a
single
dedham
man
became
a
permanent
resident
of
the
grant
in
deerfield
petitioned
the
general

as

you
may
be

intollerable

mather
we
ourselves
are
much
discouraged
as
judging
the

be
spoiled
if

not

will
not
be

up

woodstock
later
a
connecticut
town
was
settled
under
a
grant
in
the
nipmuc
country
made
to
the
town
of
roxbury
the
settlers
who
located
their
farms
near
the
trading
post
about
which
the
indians
still
collected
were
called
the
while
the
stayers
were
those
who
remained
in
roxbury
and
retained
half
of
the
new
grant
but
it
should
be
added
that
they
paid
the
a
sum
of
money
to
facilitate
the
settlement
this
absentee
proprietorship
and
the
commercial
attitude
toward
the
lands
of
new
towns
became
more
evident
in
succeeding
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
leicester
for
example
was
confirmed
by
the
general
court
in
the
twenty
shares
were
divided
among
proprietors
including
jeremiah
dummer
paul
dudley
william
dudley
like
paul
a
son
of
the
governor
joseph
dudley
thomas
hutchinson
father
of
the
later
governor
john
clark
the
political
leader
and
samuel
sewall
son
of
the
chief
justice
these
were
all
men
of
influence
and
none
of
the
proprietors
became
inhabitants
of
leicester
the
proprietors
tried
to
induce
the
fifty
families
whose
settlement
was
one
of
the
conditions
on
which
the
grant
was
made
to
occupy
the
eastern
half
of
the
township
reserving
the
rest
as
their
absolute
property
the
author
of
a
currency
tract
in
entitled
some
considerations
upon
the
several
sorts
of
banks
remarks
that
formerly
when
land
was
easy
to
be
obtained
good
men
came
over
as
indentured
servants
but
now
he
says
they
are
runaways
thieves
and
disorderly
persons
the
remedy
for
this
in
his
opinion
would
be
to
induce
servants
to
come
over
by
offering
them
homes
when
the
terms
of
indenture
should
expire
he
therefore
advocates
that
townships
should
be
laid
out
four
or
five
miles
square
in
which
grants
of
fifty
or
sixty
acres
could
be
made
to
servants
concern
over
the
increase
of
negro
slaves
in
massachusetts
seems
to
have
been
the
reason
for
this
proposal
it
indicates
that
the
current
practice
in
disposing
of
the
lands
did
not
provide
for
the
poorer
people
but
massachusetts
did
not
follow
this
suggestion
of
a
homestead
policy
on
the
contrary
the
desire
to
locate
towns
to
create
continuous
lines
of
settlement
along
the
roads
between
the
disconnected
frontiers
and
to
protect
boundary
claims
by
granting
tiers
of
towns
in
the
disputed
tract
as
well
no
doubt
as
pressure
from
financial
interests
led
the
general
court
between
and
to
dispose
of
the
remaining
public
domain
of
massachusetts
under
conditions
that
made
speculation
and
colonization
by
capitalists
important
factors
when
in
massachusetts
sold
a
group
of
townships
in
the
berkshires
to
the
highest
bidders
by
whole
townships
the
transfer
from
the
to
the
economic
conception
was
complete
and
the
frontier
was
deeply
influenced
by
the
change
to
land
mongering
in
one
respect
however
there
was
an
increasing
recognition
of
the
religious
and
social
element
in
settling
the
frontier
due
in
part
no
doubt
to
a
desire
to
provide
for
the
preservation
of
eastern
ideals
and
influences
in
the
west
provisions
for
reserving
lands
within
the
granted
townships
for
the
support
of
an
approved
minister
and
for
schools
appear
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
become
a
common
feature
of
the
grants
for
frontier
towns
in
the
eighteenth
this
practice
with
respect
to
the
new
england
frontier
became
the
foundation
for
the
system
of
grants
of
land
from
the
public
domain
for
the
support
of
common
schools
and
state
universities
by
the
federal
government
from
its
beginning
and
has
been
profoundly
influential
in
later
western
states
another
ground
for
discontent
over
land
questions
was
furnished
by
the
system
of
granting
lands
within
the
town
by
the
commoners
the
principle
which
in
many
if
not
all
cases
guided
the
proprietors
in
distributing
the
town
lots
is
familiar
and
is
well
stated
in
the
lancaster
town
records
and
whereas
lotts
are
now
laid
out
for
the
most
part
equally
to
rich
and
poore
partly
to
keepe
the
towne
from
scatering
to
farr
and
partly
out
of
charitie
and
respect
to
men
of
meaner
estate
yet
that
equallitie
which
is
the
rule
of
god
may
be
observed
we
covenant
and
agree
that
in
a
second
devition
and
so
through
all
other
devitions
of
land
the
mater
shall
be
drawne
as
neere
to
according
to
mens
as
wee
are
able
to
doe
that
he
which
hath
now
more
then
his
estate
deserveth
in
home
lotts
and
entervale
lotts
shall
haue
so
much
less
and
he
that
hath
less
then
his
estate
deserveth
shall
haue
so
much
more
this
peculiar
doctrine
of
equality
had
early
in
the
history
of
the
colony
created
discontents
winthrop
explained
the
principle
which
governed
himself
and
his
colleagues
in
the
case
of
the
boston
committee
of
by
saying
that
their
divisions
were
arranged
partly
to
prevent
the
neglect
of
trades
this
is
a
pregnant
idea
it
underlay
much
of
the
later
opposition
of
new
england
as
a
manufacturing
section
to
the
free
homestead
or
cheap
land
policy
demanded
by
the
west
and
by
the
labor
party
in
the
national
public
domain
the
migration
of
labor
to
free
lands
meant
that
higher
wages
must
be
paid
to
those
who
remained
the
use
of
the
town
lands
by
the
established
classes
to
promote
an
approved
form
of
society
naturally
must
have
had
some
effect
on
migration
but
a
more
effective
source
of
disputes
was
with
respect
to
the
relation
of
the
town
proprietors
to
the
public
domain
of
the
town
in
contrast
with
the
as
a
class
the
need
of
keeping
the
town
meeting
and
the
proprietors
meeting
separate
in
the
old
towns
in
earlier
years
was
not
so
great
as
it
was
when
the
became
numerous
in
an
increasing
degree
these
were
either
not
granted
lands
at
all
or
were
not
admitted
to
the
body
of
proprietors
with
rights
in
the
possession
of
the
undivided
town
lands
contentions
on
the
part
of
the
town
meeting
that
it
had
the
right
of
dealing
with
the
town
lands
occasionally
appear
significantly
in
the
frontier
towns
of

in

two
parties
somewhat
like
the
court

parties
of
england
the
first
party
embraced
the
great
proprietors
of
land
and
the
parties
concerned
about
land
and
other
matters
the
tendency
to
divide
up
the
common
lands
among
the
proprietors
in
individual
possession
did
not
become
marked
until
the
eighteenth
century
but
the
exclusion
of
some
from
possession
of
the
town
lands
and
the
equality
in
allotment
favoring
men
with
already
large
estates
must
have
attracted
ambitious
men
who
were
not
of
the
favored
class
to
join
in
the
movement
to
new
towns
religious
dissensions
would
combine
to
make
frontier
society
as
it
formed
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
more
and
more
democratic
dissatisfied
with
the
existing
order
and
less
respectful
of
authority
we
shall
not
understand
the
relative
radicalism
of
parts
of
the
berkshires
vermont
and
interior
new
hampshire
without
enquiry
into
the
degree
in
which
the
control
over
the
lands
by
a
proprietary
monopoly
affected
the
men
who
settled
on
the
frontier
the
final
aspect
of
this
frontier
to
be
examined
is
the
attitude
of
the
conservatives
of
the
older
sections

this
movement

his
assertion
it
is
remarkable
to
see
that
when
the
unchurched
villages
have
been
so
many
of
them
broken
in
the
that
has
been
upon
us
those
that
have
had
regularly
formed
in
them
have
generally
been
under
a
more
of
heaven
sirs
he
says
a
well
form
may
fortify
you
wonderfully
he
recommends
abstention
from
profane
swearing
furious
cursing
sabbath
breaking
unchastity
dishonesty
robbing
of
god
by
defrauding
the
ministers
of
their
dues
drunkenness
and
revels
and
he
reminds
them
that
even
the
indians
have
family
prayers
like
his
successors
who
solicited
missionary
contributions
for
the
salvation
of
the
frontier
in
the
mississippi
valley
during
the
forties
of
the
nineteenth
century
this
early
spokesman
for
new
england
laid
stress
upon
teaching
particularly
in
view
of
the
captivity
that
might
await
them
in
summing
up
we
find
many
of
the
traits
of
later
frontiers
in
this
early
prototype
the
massachusetts
frontier
it
lies
at
the
edge
of
the
indian
country
and
tends
to
advance
it
calls
out
militant
qualities
and
reveals
the
imprint
of
wilderness
conditions
upon
the
psychology
and
morals
as
well
as
upon
the
institutions
of
the
people
it
demands
common
defense
and
thus
becomes
a
factor
for
consolidation
it
is
built
on
the
basis
of
a
preliminary
fur
trade
and
is
settled
by
the
combined
and
sometimes
antagonistic
forces
of
eastern
men
of
property
the
absentee
proprietors
and
the
democratic
pioneers
the
east
attempted
to
regulate
and
control
it
individualistic
and
democratic
tendencies
were
emphasized
both
by
the
wilderness
conditions
and
probably
by
the
prior
contentions
between
the
proprietors
and
of
the
towns
from
which
settlers
moved
to
the
frontier
removal
away
from
the
control
of
the
customary
usages
of
the
older
communities
and
from
the
conservative
influence
of
the
body
of
the
clergy
increased
the
innovating
tendency
finally
the
towns
were
regarded
by
at
least
one
prominent
representative
of
the
established
order
in
the
east
as
an
undesirable
place
for
the
of
the
pillars
of
society
the
temptation
to
look
upon
the
frontier
as
a
field
for
investment
was
viewed
by
the
clergy
as
a
danger
to
the
institutions
of
god
the
frontier
was
the
wrong
side
of
the
hedge

the
old
west
it
is
not
the
oldest
west
with
which
this
chapter
deals
the
oldest
west
was
the
atlantic
coast
roughly
speaking
it
took
a
century
of
indian
fighting
and
forest
felling
for
the
colonial
settlements
to
expand
into
the
interior
to
a
distance
of
about
a
hundred
miles
from
the
coast
indeed
some
stretches
were
hardly
touched
in
that
period
this
conquest
of
the
nearest
wilderness
in
the
course
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
in
the
early
years
of
the
eighteenth
gave
control
of
the
maritime
section
of
the
nation
and
made
way
for
the
new
movement
of
westward
expansion
which
i
propose
to
discuss
in
his
winning
of
the
west
roosevelt
dealt
chiefly
with
the
region
beyond
the
alleghanies
and
with
the
period
of
the
later
eighteenth
century
although
he
prefaced
his
account
with
an
excellent
chapter
describing
the
backwoodsmen
of
the
alleghanies
and
their
social
conditions
from
to
it
is
important
to
notice
however
that
he
is
concerned
with
a
backwoods
society
already
formed
that
he
ignores
the
new
england
frontier
and
its
part
in
the
winning
of
the
west
and
does
not
recognize
that
there
was
a
west
to
be
won
between
new
england
and
the
great
lakes
in
short
he
is
interested
in
the
winning
of
the
west
beyond
the
alleghanies
by
the
southern
half
of
the
frontier
folk
there
is
then
a
western
area
intermediate
between
the
coastal
colonial
settlements
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
settlements
of
the
latter
portion
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
section
i
propose
to
isolate
and
discuss
under
the
name
of
the
old
west
and
in
the
period
from
about
to
it
includes
the
back
country
of
new
england
the
mohawk
valley
the
great
valley
of
pennsylvania
the
shenandoah
valley
and
the
piedmont
that
is
the
interior
or
upland
portion
of
the
south
lying
between
the
alleghanies
and
the
head
of
navigation
of
the
atlantic
rivers
marked
by
the
fall
line
in
this
region
and
in
these
years
are
to
be
found
the
beginnings
of
much
that
is
characteristic
in
western
society
for
the
atlantic
coast
was
in
such
close
touch
with
europe
that
its
frontier
experience
was
soon
counteracted
and
it
developed
along
other
lines
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
colonial
back
country
appealed
so
long
to
historians
solely
in
connection
with
the
colonial
wars
for
the
development
of
its
society
its
institutions
and
mental
attitude
all
need
study
its
history
has
been
dealt
with
in
separate
fragments
by
states
or
towns
or
in
discussions
of
special
phases
such
as
german
and
immigration
the
old
west
as
a
whole
can
be
appreciated
only
by
obliterating
the
state
boundaries
which
conceal
its
unity
by
correlating
the
special
and
fragmentary
studies
and
by
filling
the
gaps
in
the
material
for
understanding
the
formation
of
its
society
the
present
paper
is
rather
a
reconnaissance
than
a
conquest
of
the
field
a
program
for
study
of
the
old
west
rather
than
an
exposition
of
it
the
end
of
the
period
proposed
may
be
placed
about
and
the
beginning
between
and
the
termination
of
the
period
is
marked
by
the
peace
of
paris
in
and
the
royal
proclamation
of
that
year
forbidding
settlement
beyond
the
alleghanies
by
this
time
the
settlement
of
the
old
west
was
fairly
accomplished
and
new
advances
were
soon
made
into
the
western
waters
beyond
the
mountains
and
into
the
interior
of
vermont
and
new
hampshire
the
isolation
of
the
transmontane
settlements
and
the
special
conditions
and
doctrines
of
the
revolutionary
era
during
which
they
were
formed
make
a
natural
distinction
between
the
period
of
which
i
am
to
speak
and
the
later
extension
of
the
west
the
beginning
of
the
period
is
necessarily
an
indeterminate
date
owing
to
the
different
times
of
colonizing
the
coastal
areas
which
served
as
bases
of
operations
in
the
westward
advance
the
most
active
movements
into
the
old
west
occurred
after
but
in
new
england
having
closed
the
exhausting
struggle
with
the
indians
known
as
king
war
could
regard
her
established
settlements
as
secure
and
go
on
to
complete
her
possession
of
the
interior
this
she
did
in
the
midst
of
conflicts
with
the
exterior
indian
tribes
which
invaded
her
frontiers
from
new
york
and
canada
during
the
french
and
indian
wars
from
to
and
under
frontier
conditions
different
from
the
conditions
of
the
earlier
puritan
colonization
in
virginia
was
passing
through
indian
fighting
keenest
along
the
fall
line
where
the
frontier
lay
and
also
experiencing
a
social
revolt
which
resulted
in
the
defeat
of
the
democratic
forces
that
sought
to
stay
the
progress
of
aristocratic
control
in
the
colony
the
date
marks
the
end
of
the
period
when
the
virginia
tidewater
could
itself
be
regarded
as
a
frontier
region
and
consequently
the
beginning
of
a
more
special
interest
in
the
interior
let
us
first
examine
the
northern
part
of
the
movement
into
the
back
country
the
expansion
of
new
england
into
the
vacant
spaces
of
its
own
section
in
the
period
we
have
chosen
for
discussion
resulted
in
the
formation
of
an
interior
society
which
contrasted
in
many
ways
with
that
of
the
coast
and
which
has
a
special
significance
in
western
history
in
that
it
was
this
interior
new
england
people
who
settled
the
greater
new
england
in
central
and
western
new
york
the
wyoming
valley
the
connecticut
reserve
of
ohio
and
much
of
the
prairie
areas
of
the
old
northwest
it
is
important
to
realize
that
the
old
west
included
interior
new
england
the
situation
in
new
england
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
is
indicated
by
the
massachusetts
act
of
enumerating
eleven
towns
then
on
the
frontier
and
exposed
to
raids
none
of
which
might
be
voluntarily
deserted
without
leave
of
the
governor
and
council
on
penalty
of
loss
of
their
freeholds
by
the
landowners
or
fine
of
other
inhabitants
thus
these
frontier
settlers
were
made
substantially
garrisons
or
mark
colonies
crowded
into
the
palisades
of
the
town
and
obliged
in
spite
of
their
poverty
to
bear
the
brunt
of
indian
attack
their
hardships
are
illustrated
in
the
manly
but
pathetic
letters
of
deerfield
minister
williams
in
parkman
succinctly
describes
the
general
conditions
in
these
words
the
exposed
frontier
of
new
england
was
between
two
and
three
hundred
miles
long
and
consisted
of
farms
and
hamlets
loosely
scattered
through
an
almost
impervious
forest
even
in
villages
the
houses
were
far
apart
because
except
on
the
seashore
the
people
lived
by
farming
such
as
were
able
to
do
so
fenced
their
dwellings
with
palisades
or
built
them
of
solid
timber
with
loopholes
a
projecting
upper
story
like
a
block
house
and
sometimes
a
flanker
at
one
or
more
of
the
corners
in
the
more
considerable
settlements
the
largest
of
these
fortified
houses
was
occupied
in
time
of
danger
by
armed
men
and
served
as
a
place
of
refuge
for
the
neighbors
into
these
places
in
days
of
alarm
were
crowded
the
outlying
settlers
just
as
was
the
case
in
later
times
in
the
kentucky
stations
in
spite
of
such
frontier
conditions
the
outlying
towns
continued
to
multiply
between
and
the
middle
of
the
century
settlement
crept
up
the
housatonic
and
its
lateral
valley
into
the
berkshires
about
litchfield
was
established
in
sheffield
in
great
barrington
and
in
a
road
was
cut
and
towns
soon
established
between
westfield
and
these
housatonic
settlements
thus
uniting
them
with
the
older
extensions
along
the
connecticut
and
its
tributaries
in
this
period
scattered
and
sometimes
unwelcome
settlements
were
established
such
as
that
at
londonderry
new
hampshire
and
in
the
berkshires
as
well
as
in
the
region
won
in
king
philip
war
from
the
nipmucks
whither
there
came
also
huguenots
in
king
george
war
the
connecticut
river
settlers
found
their
frontier
protection
in
such
rude
stockades
as
those
at
the
sites
of
keene
of
charlestown
new
hampshire
number
four
fort
shirley
at
the
head
of
deerfield
river
heath
and
fort
pelham
rowe
while
fort
massachusetts
adams
guarded
the
hoosac
gateway
to
the
hoosatonic
valley
these
frontier
garrisons
and
the
of
the
backwoodsmen
of
new
england
are
well
portrayed
in
the
pages
of
parkman
at
the
close
of
the
war
settlement
again
expanded
into
the
berkshires
where
lennox
west
hoosac
williamstown
and
pittsfield
were
established
in
the
middle
of
the
century
checked
by
the
fighting
in
the
last
french
and
indian
war
the
frontier
went
forward
after
the
peace
of
paris
at
an
exceptional
rate
especially
into
vermont
and
interior
new
hampshire
an
anonymous
writer
gives
a
contemporary
view
of
the
situation
on
the
eve
of
the
revolution
the
richest
parts
remaining
to
be
granted
are
on
the
northern
branches
of
the
connecticut
river
towards
crown
point
where
are
great
districts
of
fertile
soil
still
unsettled
the
north
part
of
new
hampshire
the
province
of
maine
and
the
territory
of
sagadahock
have
but
few
settlements
in
them
compared
with
the
tracts
yet
unsettled
i
should
further
observe
that
these
tracts
have
since
the
peace
been
settling
pretty
fast
farms
on
the
river
connecticut
are
every
day
extending
beyond
the
old
fort
dummer
for
near
thirty
miles
and
will
in
a
few
years
reach
to
kohasser
which
is
nearly
two
hundred
miles
not
that
such
an
extent
will
be
settled
but
the
do
not
fix
near
their
neighbors
and
go
on
regularly
but
take
spots
that
please
them
best
though
twenty
or
thirty
miles
beyond
any
others
this
to
people
of
a
sociable
disposition
in
europe
would
appear
very
strange
but
the
americans
do
not
regard
the
near
neighborhood
of
other
farmers
twenty
or
thirty
miles
by
water
they
esteem
no
distance
in
matters
of
this
sort
besides
in
a
country
that
promises
well
the
intermediate
space
is
not
long
in
filling
up
between
connecticut
river
and
lake
champlain
upon
otter
creek
and
all
along
lake
sacrament
george
and
the
rivers
that
fall
into
it
and
the
whole
length
of
wood
creek
are
numerous
settlements
made
since
the
peace
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
therefore
new
england
communities
had
been
pushed
out
to
new
frontiers
in
the
intervals
between
the
almost
continuous
wars
with
the
french
and
indians
probably
the
most
distinctive
feature
in
this
frontier
was
the
importance
of
the
community
type
of
settlement
in
other
words
of
the
towns
with
their
puritan
ideals
in
education
morals
and
religion
this
has
always
been
a
matter
of
pride
to
the
statesmen
and
annalists
of
new
england
as
is
illustrated
by
these
words
of
holland
in
his
western
massachusetts
commenting
on
the
settlement
of
the
connecticut
valley
in
villages
whereby
in
his
judgment
morality
education
and
urbanity
were
preserved
the
influence
of
this
policy
can
only
be
fully
appreciated
when
standing
by
the
side
of
the
solitary
settler
hut
in
the
west
where
even
an
eastern
man
has
degenerated
to
a
boor
in
manners
where
his
children
have
grown
up
uneducated
and
where
the
sabbath
has
become
an
unknown
day
and
religion
and
its
obligations
have
ceased
to
exercise
control
upon
the
heart
and
life
whatever
may
be
the
real
value
of
the
community
type
of
settlement
its
establishment
in
new
england
was
intimately
connected
both
with
the
congregational
religious
organization
and
with
the
land
system
of
the
colonies
of
that
section
under
which
the
colonial
governments
made
grants
not
in
tracts
to
individuals
but
in
townships
to
groups
of
proprietors
who
in
turn
assigned
lands
to
the
inhabitants
without
cost
the
typical
form
of
establishing
a
town
was
as
follows
on
application
of
an
approved
body
of
men
desiring
to
establish
a
new
settlement
the
colonial
general
court
would
appoint
a
committee
to
view
the
desired
land
and
report
on
its
fitness
an
order
for
the
grant
would
then
issue
in
varying
areas
not
far
from
the
equivalent
of
six
miles
square
in
the
eighteenth
century
especially
it
was
common
to
reserve
certain
lots
of
the
town
for
the
support
of
schools
and
the
ministry
this
was
the
origin
of
that
very
important
feature
of
western
society
federal
land
grants
for
schools
and
colleges
the
general
courts
also
made
regulations
regarding
the
common
lands
the
terms
for
admitting
inhabitants
and
thus
kept
a
firm
hand
upon
the
social
structure
of
the
new
settlements
as
they
formed
on
the
frontier
this
practice
seen
in
its
purity
in
the
seventeenth
century
especially
was
markedly
different
from
the
practices
of
other
colonies
in
the
settlement
of
their
back
lands
for
during
most
of
the
period
new
england
did
not
use
her
wild
lands
or
public
domain
as
a
source
of
revenue
by
sale
to
individuals
or
to
companies
with
the
reservation
of
nor
attract
individual
settlers
by
head
rights
or
grants
after
the
virginia
type
nor
did
the
colonies
of
the
new
england
group
often
make
extensive
grants
to
individuals
on
the
ground
of
special
services
or
because
of
influence
with
the
government
or
on
the
theory
that
the
grantee
would
introduce
settlers
on
his
grant
they
donated
their
lands
to
groups
of
men
who
became
town
proprietors
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
communities
these
proprietors
were
supposed
to
hold
the
lands
in
trust
to
be
assigned
to
inhabitants
under
restraints
to
ensure
the
persistence
of
puritan
ideals
during
most
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
proprietors
awarded
lands
to
the
in
accordance
with
this
theory
but
as
density
of
settlement
increased
and
lands
grew
scarce
in
the
older
towns
the
proprietors
began
to
assert
their
legal
right
to
the
unoccupied
lands
and
to
refuse
to
share
them
with
inhabitants
who
were
not
of
the
body
of
proprietors
the
distinction
resulted
in
class
conflicts
in
the
towns
especially
in
the
eighteenth
century
over
the
ownership
and
disposal
of
the
common
lands
the
new
settlements
by
a
process
of
natural
selection
would
afford
opportunity
to
the
least
contented
whether
because
of
grievances
or
ambitions
to
establish
themselves
this
tended
to
produce
a
western
flavor
in
the
towns
on
the
frontier
but
it
was
not
until
the
original
ideals
of
the
land
system
began
to
change
that
the
opportunity
to
make
new
settlements
for
such
reasons
became
common
as
the
economic
and
political
ideal
replaced
the
religious
and
social
ideal
in
the
conditions
under
which
new
towns
could
be
established
this
became
more
possible
such
a
change
was
in
progress
in
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
during
the
eighteenth
in
and
massachusetts
determined
upon
a
policy
of
locating
towns
in
advance
of
settlement
to
protect
her
boundary
claims
in
she
laid
out
five
towns
near
the
new
hampshire
border
and
a
year
earlier
opened
four
contiguous
towns
to
connect
her
housatonic
and
connecticut
valley
settlements
grants
in
regions
were
sometimes
made
to
old
towns
the
proprietors
of
which
sold
them
to
those
who
wished
to
move
the
history
of
the
town
of
litchfield
illustrates
the
increasing
importance
of
the
economic
factor
at
a
time
when
connecticut
feared
that
andros
might
dispose
of
the
public
lands
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
colony
the
legislature
granted
a
large
part
of
western
connecticut
to
the
towns
of
hartford
and
windsor
as
a
means
of
withdrawing
the
lands
from
his
hands
but
these
towns
refused
to
give
up
the
lands
after
the
danger
had
passed
and
proceeded
to
sell
part
of
them
riots
occurred
when
the
colonial
authorities
attempted
to
assert
possession
and
the
matter
was
at
length
compromised
in
by
allowing
litchfield
to
be
settled
in
accordance
with
the
town
grants
while
the
colony
reserved
the
larger
part
of
northwestern
connecticut
in
the
colony
disposed
of
its
last
unlocated
lands
by
sale
in
lots
in
massachusetts
sold
a
group
of
entire
townships
in
the
berkshires
to
the
highest
bidders
but
the
most
striking
illustration
of
the
tendency
is
afforded
by
the
new
hampshire
grants
of
governor
wentworth
who
chiefly
in
the
years
about
made
grants
of
a
hundred
and
thirty
towns
west
of
the
connecticut
in
what
is
now
the
state
of
vermont
but
which
was
then
in
dispute
between
new
hampshire
and
new
york
these
grants
while
in
form
much
like
other
town
grants
were
disposed
of
for
cash
chiefly
to
speculators
who
hastened
to
sell
their
rights
to
the
throngs
of
who
after
the
peace
began
to
pour
into
the
green
mountain
region
it
is
needless
to
point
out
how
this
would
affect
the
movement
of
western
settlement
in
respect
to
individualistic
speculation
in
public
lands
how
it
would
open
a
career
to
the
land
jobbers
as
well
as
to
the
natural
leaders
in
the
competitive
movement
for
acquiring
the
best
lands
for
laying
out
town
sites
and
building
up
new
communities
under
boom
conditions
the
migratory
tendency
of
new
englanders
was
increased
by
this
gradual
change
in
its
land
policy
the
attachment
to
a
locality
was
diminished
the
later
years
showed
increasing
emphasis
by
new
england
upon
individual
success
greater
respect
for
the
man
who
in
the
midst
of
opportunities
under
competitive
conditions
achieved
superiority
the
old
dominance
of
town
settlement
village
moral
police
and
traditional
class
control
gave
way
slowly
settlement
in
communities
and
rooted
puritan
habits
and
ideals
had
enduring
influences
in
the
regions
settled
by
new
englanders
but
it
was
in
this
old
west
in
the
years
just
before
the
revolution
that
individualism
began
to
play
an
important
rôle
along
with
the
traditional
habit
of
expanding
in
organized
communities
the
opening
of
the
vermont
towns
revealed
more
fully
than
before
the
capability
of
new
englanders
to
become
democratic
pioneers
under
characteristic
frontier
conditions
their
economic
life
was
simple
and
they
readily
adopted
lynch
law
the
use
of
the
birch
seal
is
familiar
to
readers
of
vermont
history
to
protect
their
land
titles
in
the
troubled
times
when
these
green
mountain
boys
resisted
new
york
assertion
of
authority
they
later
became
an
independent
revolutionary
state
with
frontier
directness
and
in
very
many
respects
their
history
in
the
revolutionary
epoch
is
similar
to
that
of
settlers
in
kentucky
and
tennessee
both
in
assertion
of
the
right
to
independent
self
government
and
in
a
frontier
separatism
vermont
may
be
regarded
as
the
culmination
of
the
frontier
movement
which
i
have
been
describing
in
new
england
by
this
time
two
distinct
new
englands
existed
the
one
coastal
and
dominated
by
commercial
interests
and
the
established
congregational
churches
the
other
a
primitive
agricultural
area
democratic
in
principle
and
with
various
sects
increasingly
indifferent
to
the
fear
of
innovation
which
the
dominant
classes
of
the
old
communities
felt
already
speculative
land
companies
had
begun
new
england
settlements
in
the
wyoming
valley
of
pennsylvania
as
well
as
on
the
lower
mississippi
and
new
england
missions
among
the
indians
such
as
that
at
stockbridge
were
beginning
the
noteworthy
religious
and
educational
expansion
of
the
section
to
the
west
that
this
movement
of
expansion
had
been
chiefly
from
south
to
north
along
the
river
valleys
should
not
conceal
from
us
the
fact
that
it
was
in
essential
characteristics
a
western
movement
especially
in
the
social
traits
that
were
developing
even
the
men
who
lived
in
the
long
line
of
settlements
on
the
maine
coast
under
frontier
conditions
and
remote
from
the
older
centers
of
new
england
developed
traits
and
a
democratic
spirit
that
relate
them
closely
to
the
westerners
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
maine
is
down
east
by
preëminence
the
frontier
of
the
middle
region
in
this
period
of
the
formation
of
the
old
west
was
divided
into
two
parts
which
happen
to
coincide
with
the
colonies
of
new
york
and
pennsylvania
in
the
latter
colony
the
trend
of
settlement
was
into
the
great
valley
and
so
on
to
the
southern
uplands
while
the
advance
of
settlement
in
new
york
was
like
that
of
new
england
chiefly
northward
following
the
line
of
hudson
river
the
hudson
and
the
mohawk
constituted
the
area
of
the
old
west
in
this
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
with
them
were
associated
the
wallkill
tributary
to
the
hudson
and
cherry
valley
near
the
mohawk
along
the
sources
of
the
susquehanna
the
berkshires
walled
the
hudson
in
to
the
east
the
adirondacks
and
the
catskills
to
the
west
where
the
mohawk
valley
penetrated
between
the
mountainous
areas
the
iroquois
indians
were
too
formidable
for
advance
on
such
a
slender
line
nothing
but
dense
settlement
along
the
narrow
strip
of
the
hudson
if
even
that
could
have
furnished
the
necessary
momentum
for
overcoming
the
indian
barrier
and
this
pressure
was
lacking
for
the
population
was
comparatively
sparse
in
contrast
with
the
task
to
be
performed
what
most
needs
discussion
in
the
case
of
new
york
therefore
is
not
the
history
of
expansion
as
in
other
sections
but
the
absence
of
expansive
power
the
had
led
the
way
up
the
hudson
and
made
beginnings
of
settlements
at
strategic
points
near
the
confluence
of
the
mohawk
but
the
was
not
followed
by
a
tide
of
pioneers
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
restraining
density
of
population
in
new
york
in
retarding
the
settlement
of
its
frontier
and
in
determining
the
conditions
there
was
the
land
system
of
that
colony
from
the
time
of
the
patroon
grants
along
the
lower
hudson
great
estates
had
been
the
common
form
of
land
tenure
rensselaerswyck
reached
at
one
time
over
seven
hundred
thousand
acres
these
great
patroon
estates
were
confirmed
by
the
english
governors
who
in
their
turn
followed
a
similar
policy
by
two
and
million
acres
were
engrossed
in
manorial
grants
in
governor
colden
wrote
that
three
of
the
extravagant
grants
contain
as
the
proprietors
claim
above
a
million
acres
each
several
others
above
although
these
grants
contain
a
great
part
of
the
province
they
are
made
in
trifling
acknowledgements
the
far
greater
part
of
them
still
remain
uncultivated
without
any
benefit
to
the
community
and
are
likewise
a
discouragement
to
the
settling
and
improving
the
lands
in
the
neighborhood
of
them
for
from
the
uncertainty
of
their
boundaries
the
patentees
of
these
great
tracts
are
daily
enlarging
their
pretensions
and
by
tedious
and
most
expensive
law
suits
distress
and
ruin
poor
families
who
have
taken
out
grants
near
them
he
adds
that
the
proprietors
of
the
great
tracts
are
not
only
freed
from
the
which
the
other
landholders
in
the
province
pay
but
by
their
influence
in
the
assembly
are
freed
from
every
other
public
tax
on
their
lands
in
it
was
estimated
that
at
least
of
the
inhabitants
of
westchester
county
lived
within
the
bounds
of
the
great
manors
there
in
albany
county
the
livingston
manor
spread
over
seven
modern
townships
and
the
great
van
rensselaer
manor
stretched
by
miles
along
the
hudson
while
still
farther
on
the
mohawk
were
the
vast
possessions
of
sir
william
johnson
it
was
not
simply
that
the
grants
were
extensive
but
that
the
policy
of
the
proprietors
favored
the
leasing
rather
than
the
sale
of
the
lands
frequently
also
of
the
stock
and
taking
payment
in
shares
it
followed
that
settlers
preferred
to
go
to
frontiers
where
a
more
liberal
land
policy
prevailed
at
one
time
it
seemed
possible
that
the
tide
of
german
settlement
which
finally
sought
pennsylvania
and
the
of
the
south
might
flow
into
new
york
in
governor
hunter
purchased
a
tract
in
livingston
manor
and
located
nearly
fifteen
hundred
palatines
on
it
to
produce
naval
stores
but
the
attempt
soon
failed
the
germans
applied
to
the
indians
on
schoharie
creek
a
branch
of
the
mohawk
for
a
grant
of
land
and
migrated
there
only
to
find
that
the
governor
had
already
granted
the
land
again
were
the
villages
broken
up
some
remaining
and
some
moving
farther
up
the
mohawk
where
they
and
accessions
to
their
number
established
the
frontier
settlements
about
palatine
bridge
in
the
region
where
in
the
revolution
herkimer
led
these
german
frontiersmen
to
stem
the
british
attack
in
the
battle
of
oriskany
they
constituted
the
most
effective
military
defense
of
mohawk
valley
still
another
portion
took
their
way
across
to
the
waters
of
the
susquehanna
and
at
tulpehockon
creek
began
an
important
center
of
german
settlement
in
the
great
valley
of
pennsylvania
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
history
of
the
movement
into
the
frontier
of
new
york
at
this
period
therefore
was
the
evidence
which
it
afforded
that
in
the
competition
for
settlement
between
colonies
possessing
a
vast
area
of
vacant
land
those
which
imposed
feudal
tenures
and
undemocratic
restraints
and
which
exploited
settlers
were
certain
to
lose
the
manorial
practice
gave
a
bad
name
to
new
york
as
a
region
for
settlement
which
not
even
the
actual
opportunities
in
certain
parts
of
the
colony
could
counteract
the
diplomacy
of
new
york
governors
during
this
period
of
the
old
west
in
securing
a
protectorate
over
the
six
nations
and
a
consequent
claim
to
their
territory
and
in
holding
them
aloof
from
france
constituted
the
most
effective
contribution
of
that
colony
to
the
movement
of
american
expansion
when
lands
of
these
tribes
were
obtained
after
sullivan
expedition
in
the
revolution
in
which
new
england
soldiers
played
a
prominent
part
it
was
by
the
new
england
inundation
into
this
interior
that
they
were
colonized
and
it
was
under
conditions
like
those
prevailing
in
the
later
years
of
the
expansion
of
settlements
in
new
england
itself
that
this
settlement
of
interior
and
western
new
york
was
effected
the
result
was
that
new
york
became
divided
into
two
distinct
peoples
the
dwellers
along
hudson
valley
and
the
yankee
pioneers
of
the
interior
but
the
settlement
of
central
and
western
new
york
like
the
settlement
of
vermont
is
a
story
that
belongs
to
the
era
in
which
the
west
was
occupied
we
can
best
consider
the
settlement
of
the
share
of
the
old
west
which
is
located
in
pennsylvania
as
a
part
of
the
migration
which
occupied
the
southern
uplands
and
before
entering
upon
this
it
will
be
advantageous
to
survey
that
part
of
the
movement
toward
the
interior
which
proceeded
westward
from
the
coast
first
let
us
observe
the
conditions
at
the
eastern
edge
of
these
uplands
along
the
fall
line
in
virginia
in
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
in
order
that
the
process
and
the
significance
of
the
movement
may
be
better
understood
about
the
time
of
bacon
rebellion
in
virginia
strenuous
efforts
were
made
to
protect
the
frontier
line
which
ran
along
the
falls
of
the
river
against
the
attacks
of
indians
this
fall
line
as
the
geographers
call
it
marking
the
head
of
navigation
and
thus
the
boundary
of
the
maritime
or
lowland
south
runs
from
the
site
of
washington
through
richmond
and
on
to
raleigh
north
carolina
and
columbia
south
carolina
virginia
having
earliest
advanced
thus
far
to
the
interior
found
it
necessary
in
the
closing
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
to
draw
a
military
frontier
along
this
line
as
early
as
a
statute
was
enacted
providing
that
paid
troops
of
five
hundred
men
should
be
drawn
from
the
midland
and
most
secure
parts
of
the
country
and
placed
on
the
heads
of
the
rivers
and
other
places
fronting
upon
the
indians
what
was
meant
by
the
heads
of
the
rivers
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
several
of
these
forts
were
located
either
at
the
falls
of
the
rivers
or
just
above
tidewater
as
follows
one
on
the
lower
potomac
in
stafford
county
one
near
the
falls
of
the
rappahannock
one
on
the
mattapony
one
on
the
pamunky
one
at
the
falls
of
the
james
near
the
site
of
richmond
one
near
the
falls
of
the
appomattox
and
others
on
the
blackwater
the
nansemond
and
the
accomac
peninsula
all
in
the
eastern
part
of
virginia
again
in
similar
provision
was
made
and
an
especially
interesting
act
was
passed
making
manorial
grants
to
major
lawrence
smith
and
captain
william
byrd
to
seate
certain
lands
at
the
head
falls
of
rappahannock
and
james
river
respectively
this
scheme
failed
for
lack
of
approval
by
the
authorities
in
england
but
byrd
at
the
falls
of
the
james
near
the
present
site
of
richmond
robert
beverley
on
the
rappahannock
and
other
frontier
commanders
on
the
york
and
potomac
continued
to
undertake
colonial
defense
the
system
of
mounted
rangers
was
established
in
by
which
a
lieutenant
eleven
soldiers
and
two
indians
at
the
heads
or
falls
of
each
great
river
were
to
scout
for
enemy
and
the
indian
boundary
line
was
strictly
defined
by
the
opening
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
assembly
of
virginia
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
settlement
would
be
the
best
means
of
protecting
the
frontiers
and
that
the
best
way
of
settling
in
upon
the
said
land
frontiers
within
this
government
will
be
by
encouragements
to
induce
societies
of
men
to
undertake
the
same
it
was
declared
to
be
inexpedient
to
have
less
than
twenty
fighting
men
in
each
society
and
provision
was
made
for
a
land
grant
to
be
given
to
these
societies
or
towns
not
less
than
nor
more
than
acres
upon
any
of
the
frontiers
to
be
held
in
common
by
the
society
the
power
of
ordering
and
managing
these
lands
and
the
settling
and
planting
of
them
was
to
remain
in
the
society
virginia
was
to
pay
the
cost
of
survey
also
for
the
first
twenty
years
for
the
tract
as
the
site
of
the
within
this
two
hundred
acres
each
member
was
to
have
a
lot
for
living
upon
and
a
right
to
two
hundred
acres
next
adjacent
until
the
thirty
thousand
acres
were
taken
up
the
members
of
the
society
were
exempt
from
taxes
for
twenty
years
and
from
the
requirements
of
military
duty
except
such
as
they
imposed
upon
themselves
the
resemblance
to
the
new
england
town
is
obvious
provided
alwayes
ran
the
quaint
statute
and
it
is
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
this
act
that
for
every
five
hundred
acres
of
land
to
be
granted
in
pursuance
of
this
act
there
shall
be
and
shall
be
continually
kept
upon
the
said
land
one
christian
man
between
sixteen
and
sixty
years
of
age
perfect
of
limb
able
and
fitt
for
service
who
shall
alsoe
be
continually
provided
with
a
well
fixed
musquett
or
fuzee
a
good
pistoll
sharp
simeter
tomahawk
and
five
pounds
of
good
clean
pistoll
powder
and
twenty
pounds
of
sizable
leaden
bulletts
or
swan
or
goose
shott
to
be
kept
within
the
fort
directed
by
this
act
besides
the
powder
and
shott
for
his
necessary
or
useful
shooting
at
game
provided
also
that
the
said
warlike
christian
man
shall
have
his
dwelling
and
continual
abode
within
the
space
of
two
hundred
acres
of
land
to
be
laid
out
in
a
geometricall
square
or
as
near
that
figure
as
conveniency
will
admit
etc
within
two
years
the
society
was
required
to
cause
a
half
acre
in
the
middle
of
the
to
be
palisaded
with
good
sound
pallisadoes
at
least
thirteen
foot
long
and
six
inches
diameter
in
the
middle
of
the
length
thereof
and
set
double
and
at
least
three
foot
within
the
ground
such
in
was
the
idea
of
the
virginia
tidewater
assembly
of
a
frontiersman
and
of
the
frontier
towns
by
which
the
old
dominion
should
spread
her
population
into
the
upland
south
but
the
warlike
christian
man
who
actually
came
to
furnish
the
firing
line
for
virginia
was
destined
to
be
the
and
the
german
with
long
rifle
in
place
of
fuzee
and
simeter
and
altogether
too
restless
to
have
his
continual
abode
within
the
space
of
two
hundred
acres
nevertheless
there
are
points
of
resemblance
between
this
idea
of
societies
settled
about
a
fortified
town
and
the
later
stations
of
kentucky
by
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
engrossing
of
the
lands
of
lowland
virginia
had
progressed
so
far
the
practice
of
holding
large
tracts
of
wasteland
for
reserves
in
the
great
plantations
had
become
so
common
that
the
authorities
of
virginia
reported
to
the
home
government
that
the
best
lands
were
all
taken
up
and
settlers
were
passing
into
north
carolina
seeking
cheap
lands
near
navigable
rivers
attention
was
directed
also
to
the
piedmont
portions
of
virginia
for
by
this
time
the
indians
were
conquered
in
this
region
it
was
now
possible
to
acquire
land
by
purchase
at
five
shillings
sterling
for
fifty
acres
as
well
as
by
for
importation
or
settlement
and
land
speculation
soon
turned
to
the
new
area
already
the
piedmont
had
been
somewhat
explored
even
by
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
had
followed
the
trail
southwest
from
the
james
more
than
four
hundred
miles
to
the
catawbas
and
later
to
the
cherokees
william
byrd
had
as
we
have
seen
not
only
been
absorbing
good
lands
in
the
lowlands
and
defending
his
post
at
the
falls
of
the
james
like
a
count
of
the
border
but
he
also
engaged
in
this
and
sent
his
pack
trains
along
this
trail
through
the
piedmont
of
the
carolinas
and
took
note
of
the
rich
savannas
of
that
region
charleston
traders
engaged
in
rivalry
for
this
trade
it
was
not
long
before
cattle
raisers
from
the
older
settlements
learning
from
the
traders
of
the
fertile
plains
and
peavine
pastures
of
this
land
followed
the
and
erected
scattered
or
ranches
beyond
the
line
of
plantations
in
the
piedmont
even
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
herds
of
wild
horses
and
cattle
ranged
at
the
outskirts
of
the
virginia
settlements
and
were
hunted
by
the
planters
driven
into
pens
and
branded
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
the
later
ranching
on
the
great
plains
now
the
and
the
began
to
enter
the
uplands
the
indians
had
by
this
time
been
reduced
to
submission
in
most
of
the
virginia
piedmont
as
governor
spotswood
reported
in
living
quietly
on
our
frontiers
trafficking
with
the
inhabitants
after
the
defeat
of
the
tuscaroras
and
yemassees
about
this
time
in
the
carolinas
similar
opportunities
for
expansion
existed
there
the
cattle
drovers
sometimes
took
their
herds
from
range
to
range
sometimes
they
were
gathered
permanently
near
the
pens
finding
the
range
sufficient
throughout
the
year
they
were
driven
to
charleston
or
later
sometimes
even
to
philadelphia
and
baltimore
markets
by
the
middle
of
the
century
disease
worked
havoc
with
them
in
south
carolina
and
destroyed
of
those
in
north
carolina
virginia
made
regulations
governing
the
driving
of
cattle
through
her
frontier
counties
to
avoid
the
disease
just
as
in
our
own
time
the
northern
cattlemen
attempted
to
protect
their
herds
against
the
texas
fever
thus
cattle
raisers
from
the
coast
followed
the
toward
the
uplands
and
already
pioneer
farmers
were
straggling
into
the
same
region
soon
to
be
outnumbered
by
the
tide
of
settlement
that
flowed
into
the
region
from
pennsylvania
the
descriptions
of
the
uplands
by
contemporaneous
writers
are
in
glowing
terms
makemie
in
his
plain
and
friendly
persuasion
declared
the
best
richest
and
most
healthy
part
of
your
country
is
yet
to
be
inhabited
above
the
falls
of
every
river
to
the
mountains
jones
in
his
present
state
of
virginia
comments
on
the
convenience
of
tidewater
transportation
but
declares
that
section
not
nearly
so
healthy
as
the
uplands
and
barrens
which
serve
for
ranges
for
stock
although
he
speaks
less
enthusiastically
of
the
savannas
and
marshes
which
lay
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
areas
in
fact
the
piedmont
was
by
no
means
the
unbroken
forest
that
might
have
been
imagined
for
in
addition
to
natural
meadows
the
indians
had
burned
over
large
tracts
it
was
a
rare
combination
of
woodland
and
pasture
with
clear
running
streams
and
mild
climate
the
occupation
of
the
virginia
piedmont
received
a
special
impetus
from
the
interest
which
governor
spotswood
took
in
the
frontier
in
he
proposed
a
plan
for
intercepting
the
french
in
their
occupation
of
the
interior
by
inducing
virginia
settlement
to
proceed
along
one
side
of
james
river
only
until
this
column
of
advancing
pioneers
should
strike
the
attenuated
line
of
french
posts
in
the
center
in
the
same
year
he
sent
a
body
of
horsemen
to
the
top
of
the
blue
ridge
where
they
could
overlook
the
valley
of
virginia
by
he
became
active
as
a
colonizer
himself
thirty
miles
above
the
falls
of
the
rappahannock
on
the
rapidan
at
germanna
he
settled
a
little
village
of
german
redemptioners
who
in
return
for
having
the
passage
paid
agreed
to
serve
without
wages
for
a
term
of
years
to
engage
in
his
iron
works
also
to
act
as
rangers
on
the
frontier
from
here
in
with
two
companies
of
rangers
and
four
indians
governor
spotswood
and
a
band
of
virginia
gentlemen
made
a
summer
picnic
excursion
of
two
weeks
across
the
blue
ridge
into
the
shenandoah
valley
juvat
transcendere
was
the
motto
of
these
knights
of
the
golden
horse
shoe
as
the
governor
dubbed
them
but
they
were
not
the
warlike
christian
men
destined
to
occupy
the
frontier
spotswood
interest
in
the
advance
along
the
rappahannock
probably
accounts
for
the
fact
that
in
spotsylvania
and
brunswick
were
organized
as
frontier
counties
of
virginia
five
hundred
dollars
were
contributed
by
the
colony
to
the
church
and
a
thousand
dollars
for
arms
and
ammunition
for
the
settlers
in
these
counties
the
fears
of
the
french
and
indians
beyond
the
high
mountains
were
alleged
as
reasons
for
this
advance
to
attract
settlers
to
these
new
counties
they
were
exempt
from
purchasing
the
lands
under
the
system
of
head
rights
and
from
payment
of
for
seven
years
after
the
free
grants
so
obtained
were
not
to
exceed
a
thousand
acres
this
was
soon
extended
to
six
thousand
acres
but
with
provision
requiring
the
settlement
of
a
certain
number
of
families
upon
the
grant
within
a
certain
time
in
spotswood
was
ordered
by
the
council
to
produce
rights
and
pay
the
for
the
acres
which
he
claimed
in
this
county
other
similar
actions
by
the
council
show
that
large
holdings
were
developing
there
also
that
the
difficulty
of
establishing
a
frontier
democracy
in
contact
with
the
area
of
expanding
plantations
was
very
real
by
the
time
of
the
occupation
of
the
shenandoah
valley
therefore
the
custom
was
established
in
this
part
of
virginia
of
making
grants
of
a
thousand
acres
for
each
family
settled
speculative
planters
influential
with
the
governor
and
council
secured
grants
of
many
thousand
acres
conditioned
upon
seating
a
certain
number
of
families
and
satisfying
the
requirements
of
planting
thus
what
had
originally
been
intended
as
direct
grants
to
the
actual
settler
frequently
became
grants
to
great
planters
like
beverley
who
promoted
the
coming
of
and
german
settlers
or
took
advantage
of
the
natural
drift
into
the
valley
to
sell
lands
in
their
grants
as
a
rule
reserving
the
liberal
grants
per
family
enabled
these
speculative
planters
while
satisfying
the
terms
of
settlement
to
hold
large
portions
of
the
grant
for
themselves
under
the
lax
requirements
and
probably
still
more
lax
enforcement
of
the
provisions
for
actual
cultivation
or
it
was
not
difficult
to
hold
such
wild
land
these
conditions
rendered
possible
the
extension
of
a
measure
of
aristocratic
planter
life
in
the
course
of
time
to
the
piedmont
and
valley
lands
of
virginia
it
must
be
added
however
that
some
of
the
newcomers
both
germans
and
like
the
van
meters
stover
and
lewis
also
showed
an
ability
to
act
as
promoters
in
locating
settlers
and
securing
grants
to
themselves
in
the
northern
part
of
the
shenandoah
valley
lay
part
of
the
estate
of
lord
fairfax
some
six
million
acres
in
extent
which
came
to
the
family
by
dower
from
the
old
culpeper
and
arlington

of

the
youthful

this
estate
along
the
upper
waters
of
the
potomac
finding
a
bed
under
the
stars
and
learning
the
life
of
the
frontier
lord
fairfax
established
his
own
greenway
manor
and
divided
his
domain
into
other
manors
giving
leases
to
settlers
already
on
the
ground
at
twenty
shillings
annually
per
hundred
acres
while
of
the
he
exacted
two
shillings
annual
for
this
amount
of
land
in
fee
simple
litigation
kept
land
titles
uncertain
here
for
many
years
similarly
beverley
manor
about
staunton
represented
a
grant
of
acres
to
beverley
and
his
associates
on
condition
of
placing
the
proper
number
of
families
on
the
tract
thus
speculative
planters
on
this
frontier
shared
in
the
movement
of
occupation
and
made
an
aristocratic
element
in
the
but
the
increasing
proportion
of
immigrants
as
well
as
german
settlers
together
with
the
contrast
in
natural
conditions
made
the
interior
a
different
virginia
from
that
of
the
tidewater
as
settlement
ascended
the
rappahannock
and
emigrants
began
to
enter
the

so
contemporaneously

the

above
the
falls
succeeding
to
the
posts
of
the
goochland
county
was
set
off
in
and
the
growth
of
population
led
as
early
as
to
proposals
for
establishing
a
city
richmond
at
the
falls
along
the
upper
james
as
on
the
rappahannock
speculative
planters
bought
headrights
and
located
settlers
and
tenants
to
hold
their
grants
into
this
region
came
natives
of
virginia
emigrants
from
the
british
isles
and
scattered
representatives
of
other
lands
some
of
them
coming
up
the
james
others
up
the
york
and
still
others
arriving
with
the
current
along
both
sides
of
the
blue
ridge

lived
above
the
mouth
of
the

a
thousand

the
eastern
opening
of
its

here
under
frontier
conditions
thomas
jefferson
was
born
in
near
his
later
estate
of
monticello
about
him
were
pioneer
farmers
as
well
as
foresighted
engrossers
of
the
land
in
the
main
his
country
was
that
of
a
democratic
frontier
people
presbyterians
quakers
baptists
and
other
sects
out
of
sympathy
with
the
established
church
and
the
landed
gentry
of
the
lowlands
this
society
in
which
he
was
born
was
to
find
in
jefferson
a
powerful
exponent
of
its
ideals
patrick
henry
was
born
in
above
the
falls
not
far
from
richmond
and
he
also
was
a
mouthpiece
of
interior
virginia
in
the
revolutionary
era
in
short
a
society
was
already
forming
in
the
virginia
piedmont
which
was
composed
of
many
sects
of
independent
yeomen
as
well
as
their
great
planter
leaders
a
society
naturally
expansive
seeing
its
opportunity
to
deal
in
unoccupied
lands
along
the
frontier
which
continually
moved
toward
the
west
and
in
this
era
of
the
eighteenth
century
dominated
by
the
democratic
ideals
of
pioneers
rather
than
by
the
aristocratic
tendencies
of
slaveholding
planters
as
there
were
two
new
englands
so
there
were
by
this
time
two
virginias
and
the
uplands
belonged
with
the
old
west
the
advance
across
the
fall
line
from
the
coast
was
in
north
carolina
much
slower
than
in
virginia
after
the
tuscarora
war
an
extensive
region
west
from
pamlico
sound
was
opened
the
region
to
the
north
about
the
roanoke
had
before
this
begun
to
receive
frontier
settlers
largely
from
virginia
their
traits
are
interestingly
portrayed
in
byrd
dividing
line
by
the
farthest
inhabitants
along
the
virginia
boundary
were
frontiersmen
about
great
creek
a
branch
of
the
roanoke
the
north
carolina
commissioners
desired
to
stop
running
the
line
after
going
a
hundred
and
seventy
miles
on
the
plea
that
they
were
already
fifty
miles
beyond
the
outermost
inhabitant
and
there
would
be
no
need
for
an
age
or
two
to
carry
the
line
farther
but
the
virginia
surveyors
pointed
out
that
already
speculators
were
taking
up
the
land
a
line
from
weldon
to
fayetteville
would
roughly
mark
the
western
boundary
of
north
carolina
sparse
population
of
forty
thousand
souls
the
slower
advance
is
explained
partly
because
of
the
later
settlement
of
the
carolinas
partly
because
the
indians
continued
to
be
troublesome
on
the
flanks
of
the
advancing
population
as
seen
in
the
tuscarora
and
yemassee
wars
and
partly
because
the
pine
barrens
running
parallel
with
the
fall
line
made
a
zone
of
infertile
land
not
attractive
to
settlers
the
north
carolina
low
country
indeed
had
from
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
been
a
kind
of
southern
frontier
for
overflow
from
virginia
and
in
many
ways
was
assimilated
to
the
type
of
the
in
its
turbulent
democracy
its
variety
of
sects
and
peoples
and
its
primitive
conditions
but
under
the
lax
management
of
the
public
lands
the
use
of
blank
patents
and
other
evasions
made
possible
the
development
of
large
landholding
side
by
side
with
headrights
to
settlers
here
as
in
virginia
a
great
proprietary
grant
extended
across
the
colony
lord
granville
proprietary
was
a
zone
embracing
the
northern
half
of
north
carolina
within
the
area
sales
and
were
administered
by
the
agents
of
the
owner
with
the
result
that
uncertainty
and
disorder
of
an
agrarian
nature
extended
down
to
the
revolution
there
were
likewise
great
speculative
holdings
conditioned
on
seating
a
certain
proportion
of
settlers
into
which
the
frontiersmen
were
drifting
but
this
system
also
made
it
possible
for
agents
of
later
migrating
congregations
to
establish
colonies
like
that
of
the
moravians
at
wachovia
thus
by
the
time
settlers
came
into
the
uplands
from
the
north
a
land
system
existed
similar
to
that
of
virginia
a
common
holding
was
a
square
mile
acres
but
in
practice
this
did
not
prevent
the
accumulation
of
great
estates
whereas
virginia
piedmont
area
was
to
a
large
extent
entered
by
extensions
from
the
coast
that
of
north
carolina
remained
almost
untouched
by
the
same
is
true
of
south
carolina
by
settlement
had
progressed
hardly
eighty
miles
from
the
coast
even
in
the
settled
area
of
the
lowlands
the
tendency
to
engross
the
lowlands
for
large
plantations
was
clear
here
as
elsewhere
the
reports
in
that
not
as
many
as
a
thousand
acres
within
a
hundred
miles
of
charleston
or
within
twenty
miles
of
a
river
or
navigable
creek
were
unpossessed
in
the
crown
ordered
eleven
townships
of
twenty
thousand
acres
each
to
be
laid
out
in
rectangles
divided
into
fifty
acres
for
each
actual
settler
under
a
of
four
shillings
a
year
for
every
hundred
acres
or
proportionally
to
be
paid
after
the
first
ten
years
by
these
townships
designed
to
attract
foreign
protestants
were
laid
out
on
the
great
rivers
of
the
colony
as
they
were
located
in
the
middle
region
east
of
the
fall
line
among
pine
barrens
or
in
malarial
lands
in
the
southern
corner
of
the
colony
they
all
proved
abortive
as
towns
except
orangeburg
on
the
north
edisto
where
german
redemptioners
made
a
settlement
the
presbyterians
who
came
to
williamsburg
on
black
river
suffered
hardships
as
did
the
swiss
who
under
the
visionary
leadership
of
purry
settled
in
the
deadly
climate
of
purrysburg
on
the
lower
savannah
to
welsh
colonists
from
pennsylvania
there
was
made
a
grant
known
as
the
welsh
tract
embracing
over
acres
on
the
great
pedee
marion
county
under
headrights
of
fifty
acres
also
a
bounty
in
provisions
tools
and
livestock
these
attempts
east
of
the
fall
line
are
interesting
as
showing
the
colonial
policy
of
marking
out
towns
which
were
to
be
parishes
with
representation
in
the
legislature
and
attracting
foreigners
thereto
prior
to
the
coming
of
settlers
from
the
north
the
settlement
of
georgia
in
completed
the
southern
line
of
colonization
toward
the
piedmont
among
the
objects
of
the
colony
as
specified
in
the
charters
were
the
relief
of
the
poor
and
the
protection
of
the
frontiers
to
guard
against
the
tendency
to
engross
the
lands
in
great
estates
already
so
clearly
revealed
in
the
older
colonies
the
georgia
trustees
provided
that
the
grants
of
fifty
acres
should
not
be
alienated
or
divided
but
should
pass
to
the
male
heirs
and
revert
to
the
trustees
in
case
heirs
were
lacking
no
grant
greater
than
five
hundred
acres
was
permitted
and
even
this
was
made
conditionally
upon
the
holder
settling
ten
colonists
however
under
local
conditions
and
the
competition
and
example
of
neighboring
colonies
this
attempt
to
restrict
land
tenure
in
the
interest
of
democracy
broke
down
by
and
georgia
land
system
became
not
unlike
that
of
the
other
southern
colonies
in
salzburgers
had
been
located
above
savannah
and
within
seven
years
some
twelve
hundred
german
protestants
were
dwelling
on
the
georgia
frontier
while
a
settlement
of
scotch
highlanders
at
darien
near
the
mouth
of
the
altamaha
protected
the
southern
frontier
at
augusta
an
indian
trading
fort
whence
the
dealers
in
peltry
visited
the
cherokee
completed
the
familiar
picture
of
frontier
advance
we
have
now
hastily
surveyed
the
movement
of
the
frontier
of
settlement
westward
from
the
lowlands
in
the
later
years
of
the
seventeenth
and
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
is
much
that
is
common
in
the
whole
line
of
advance
the
original
settlers
engross
the
desirable
lands
of
the
older
area
indented
servants
and
pass
to
the
frontier
seeking
a
place
to
locate
their
headrights
or
plant
new
towns
adventurous
and
speculative
wealthy
planters
acquire
large
holdings
in
the
new
areas
and
bring
over
settlers
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
seating
and
cultivating
their
extensive
grants
thus
building
up
a
yeomanry
of
small
landholders
side
by
side
with
the
holders
of
large
estates
the
most
of
the
follow
the
example
of
the
planters
and
petition
for
increasing
extensive
grants
meanwhile
pioneers
like
abraham
wood
himself
once
an
indented
servant
and
gentlemen
like
william
byrd
prosecuting
the
indian
trade
from
their
posts
at
the
heads
of
the
rivers
and
combining
frontier
protection
exploring
and
surveying
make
known
the
more
distant
fertile
soils
of
the
piedmont
already
in
the
first
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
frontier
population
tended
to
be
a
rude
democracy
with
a
large
representation
of
germans
welsh
and
huguenot
french
settlers
holding
religious
faiths
unlike
that
of
the
followers
of
the
established
church
in
the
lowlands
the
movement
of
slaves
into
the
region
was
unimportant
but
not
unknown
the
virginia
valley
was
practically
unsettled
in
as
was
much
of
virginia
piedmont
area
and
all
the
piedmont
area
of
the
carolinas
the
significance
of
the
movement
of
settlers
from
the
north
into
this
vacant
valley
and
piedmont
behind
the
area
occupied
by
expansion
from
the
coast
is
that
it
was
geographically
separated
from
the
westward
movement
from
the
coast
and
that
it
was
sufficient
in
volume
to
recruit
the
democratic
forces
and
postpone
for
a
long
time
the
process
of
social
assimilation
to
the
type
of
the
lowlands
as
has
been
pointed
out
especially
in
the
carolinas
a
belt
of
pine
barrens
roughly
eighty
miles
in
breadth
ran
parallel
with
the
fall
line
and
thus
discouraged
western
advance
across
this
belt
even
before
the
head
of
navigation
was
reached
in
virginia
the
blue
ridge
made
an
almost
equally
effective
barrier
walling
off
the
shenandoah
valley
from
the
westward
advance
at
the
same
time
this
valley
was
but
a
continuation
of
the
great
valley
that
ran
along
the
eastern
edge
of
the
alleghanies
in
southeastern
pennsylvania
and
included
in
its
mountain
trough
the
cumberland
and
hagerstown
valleys
in
short
a
broad
limestone
band
of
fertile
soil
was
stretched
within
mountain
walls
southerly
from
pennsylvania
to
southwestern
virginia
and
here
the
watergaps
opened
the
way
to
descend
to
the
carolina
piedmont
this
whole
area
a
kind
of
peninsula
thrust
down
from
pennsylvania
was
rendered
comparatively
inaccessible
to
the
westward
movement
from
the
lowlands
and
was
equally
accessible
to
the
population
which
was
entering
pennsylvania
thus
it
happened
that
from
about
to
a
generation
of
settlers
poured
along
this
mountain
trough
into
the
southern
uplands
or
piedmont
creating
a
new
continuous
social
and
economic
area
which
cut
across
the
artificial
colonial
boundary
lines
disarranged
the
regular
extension
of
local
government
from
the
coast
westward
and
built
up
a
new
pennsylvania
in
contrast
with
the
old
quaker
colonies
and
a
new
south
in
contrast
with
the
tidewater
south
this
new
south
composed
the
southern
half
of
the
old
west
from
its
beginning
pennsylvania
was
advertised
as
a
home
for
dissenting
sects
seeking
freedom
in
the
wilderness
but
it
was
not
until
the
exodus
of
german
redemptioners
from
about
that
the
palatinate
and
neighboring
areas
sent
the
great
tide
of
germans
which
by
the
time
of
the
revolution
made
them
nearly
a
third
of
the
total
population
of
pennsylvania
it
has
been
carefully
estimated
that
in
over
germans
lived
in
the
thirteen
colonies
chiefly
along
the
frontier
zone
of
the
old
west
of
these
a
hundred
thousand
had
their
home
in
pennsylvania
mainly
in
the
great
valley
in
the
region
which
is
still
so
notably
the
abode
of
the
pennsylvania
dutch
space
does
not
permit
us
to
describe
this
movement
of
colonization
the
entrance
to
the
fertile
limestone
soils
of
the
great
valley
of
pennsylvania
was
easy
in
view
of
the
low
elevation
of
the
south
mountain
ridge
and
the
watergaps
thereto
the
continuation
along
the
similar
valley
to
the
south
in
maryland
and
virginia
was
a
natural
one
especially
as
the
increasing
tide
of
emigrants
raised
the
price
of
lands
in
the
proprietor
price
for
pennsylvania
lands
was
ten
pounds
per
hundred
acres
and
two
shillings
in
this
became
fifteen
and
pounds
with
a
of
a
half
penny
per
acre
during
the
period
to
when
the
germans
were
coming
in
great
numbers
the
management
of
the
lands
fell
into
confusion
and
many
seated
themselves
as
squatters
without
title
this
was
a
fortunate
possibility
for
the
poor
redemptioners
who
had
sold
their
service
for
a
term
of
years
in
order
to
secure
their
transportation
to
america
by
it
was
estimated
that
there
were
squatters
and
of
the
acres
occupied
between
and
it
is
estimated
that
acres
were
settled
without
grants
nevertheless
these
must
ultimately
be
paid
for
with
interest
and
the
concession
of
the
right
of
preëmption
to
squatters
made
this
easier
but
it
was
not
until
that
the
governor
offered
land
free
from
purchase
and
this
was
to
be
taken
only
west
of
the
alleghanies
although
the
credit
system
relieved
the
difficulty
in
pennsylvania
the
lands
of
that
colony
were
in
competition
with
the
maryland
lands
offered
between
and
at
forty
shillings
sterling
per
hundred
acres
which
in
was
raised
to
five
pounds
sterling
at
the
same
time
in
the
virginia
valley
as
will
be
recalled
free
grants
were
being
made
of
a
thousand
acres
per
family
although
large
tracts
of
the
shenandoah
valley
had
been
granted
to
speculators
like
beverley
borden
and
the
carters
as
well
as
to
lord
fairfax
the
owners
sold
six
or
seven
pounds
cheaper
per
hundred
acres
than
did
the
pennsylvania
land
office
between
and
therefore
the
germans
began
to
enter
this
valley
and
before
long
they
extended
their
settlements
into
the
piedmont
of
the
carolinas
being
recruited
in
south
carolina
by
emigrants
coming
by
way
of
charleston
especially
after
governor
glenn
purchase
from
the
cherokee
in
of
the
extreme
western
portion
of
the
colony
between
and
the
revolution
these
settlers
in
the
carolinas
greatly
increased
in
numbers
thus
a
zone
of
almost
continuous
german
settlements
had
been
established
running
from
the
head
of
the
mohawk
in
new
york
to
the
savannah
in
georgia
they
had
found
the
best
soils
and
they
knew
how
to
till
them
intensively
and
thriftily
as
attested
by
their
large
barns
good
stock
and
big
conestoga
wagons
they
preferred
to
dwell
in
groups
often
of
the
same
religious
denomination
lutherans
reformed
moravians
mennonites
and
many
lesser
sects
the
diaries
of
moravian
missionaries
from
pennsylvania
who
visited
them
show
how
the
parent
congregations
kept
in
touch
with
their
colonies
and
how
intimate
in
general
was
the
bond
of
connection
between
this
whole
german
frontier
zone
and
that
of
pennsylvania
side
by
side
with
this
german
occupation
of
valley
and
piedmont
went
the
migration
of
the
these
lowland
scots
had
been
planted
in
ulster
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
followers
of
john
knox
they
had
the
contentious
individualism
and
revolutionary
temper
that
seem
natural
to
scotch
presbyterianism
they
were
brought
up
on
the
old
testament
and
in
the
doctrine
of
government
by
covenant
or
compact
in
ireland
their
fighting
qualities
had
been
revealed
in
the
siege
of
londonderry
where
their
stubborn
resistance
balked
the
hopes
of
james
ii
however
religious
and
political
disabilities
were
imposed
upon
these
ulstermen
which
made
them
discontented
and
hard
times
contributed
to
detach
them
from
their
homes
their
movement
to
america
was
contemporaneous
with
the
heavy
german
migration
by
the
revolution
it
is
believed
that
a
third
of
the
population
of
pennsylvania
was
and
it
has
been
estimated
probably
too
liberally
that
a
half
million
came
to
the
united
states
between
and
especially
after
the
rebellion
of
large
numbers
of
highlanders
came
to
increase
the
scotch
blood
in
the
nation
some
of
the
went
to
new
england
given
the
cold
shoulder
by
congregational
puritans
they
passed
to
unsettled
lands
about
worcester
to
the
frontier
in
the
berkshires
and
in
southern
new
hampshire
at
londonderry
whence
came
john
stark
a
frontier
leader
in
the
french
and
indian
war
and
the
hero
of
bennington
in
the
revolution
as
well
as
the
ancestors
of
horace
greeley
and
chase
in
new
york
a
settlement
was
planted
on
the
frontier
at
cherry
valley
scotch
highlanders
came
to
the
mohawk
where
they
followed
sir
william
johnson
and
became
tory
raiders
in
the
revolution
but
it
was
in
pennsylvania
that
the
center
of
power
lay
these
bold
and
indigent
strangers
saying
as
their
excuse
when
challenged
for
titles
that
we
had
solicited
for
colonists
and
they
had
come
accordingly
and
asserting
that
it
was
against
the
laws
of
god
and
nature
that
so
much
land
should
be
idle
while
so
many
christians
wanted
it
to
work
on
and
to
raise
their
bread
squatted
on
the
vacant
lands
especially
in
the
region
disputed
between
pennsylvania
and
maryland
and
remained
in
spite
of
efforts
to
drive
them
off
finding
the
great
valley
in
the
hands
of
the
germans
they
planted
their
own
outposts
along
the
line
of
the
indian
trading
path
from
lancaster
to
bedford
they
occupied
cumberland
valley
and
before
pressed
up
the
juniata
somewhat
beyond
the
narrows
spreading
out
along
its
tributaries
and
by
had
to
be
warned
off
from
the
redstone
country
to
avoid
indian
trouble
by
the
time
of
the
revolution
their
settlements
made
pittsburgh
a
center
from
which
was
to
come
a
new
era
in
pennsylvania
history
it
was
the
and
german
whose
pack
trains
pioneered
into
the
ohio
valley
in
the
days
before
the
french
and
indian
wars
the
messengers
between
civilization
and
savagery
were
such
men
as
the
irish
croghan
and
the
germans
conrad
weiser
and
christian
post
like
the
germans
the
passed
into
the
shenandoah
valley
and
on
to
the
uplands
of
the
south
in
a
delegation
of
the
philadelphia
presbyterian
synod
was
sent
to
the
virginia
governor
and
received
assurances
of
security
of
religious
freedom
the
same
policy
was
followed
by
the
carolinas
by
a
zone
of
presbyterian
churches
extended
from
the
frontiers
of
new
england
to
the
frontiers
of
south
carolina
this
zone
combined
in
part
with
the
german
zone
but
in
general
tended
to
follow
the
valleys
farther
toward
the
mountains
to
be
the
outer
edge
of
this
frontier
along
with
this
combined
frontier
stream
were
english
welsh
and
irish
quakers
and
french
huguenots
among
this
moving
mass
as
it
passed
along
the
valley
into
the
piedmont
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
were
daniel
boone
john
sevier
james
robertson
and
the
ancestors
of
john
calhoun
abraham
lincoln
jefferson
davis
stonewall
jackson
james
polk
sam
houston
and
davy
crockett
while
the
father
of
andrew
jackson
came
to
the
carolina
piedmont
at
the
same
time
from
the
coast
recalling
that
thomas
jefferson
home
was
on
the
frontier
at
the
edge
of
the
blue
ridge
we
perceive
that
these
names
represent
the
militant
expansive
movement
in
american
life
they
foretell
the
settlement
across
the
alleghanies
in
kentucky
and
tennessee
the
louisiana
purchase
and
lewis
and
transcontinental
exploration
the
conquest
of
the
gulf
plains
in
the
war
of
the
annexation
of
texas
the
acquisition
of
california
and
the
spanish
southwest
they
represent
too
frontier
democracy
in
its
two
aspects
personified
in
andrew
jackson
and
abraham
lincoln
it
was
a
democracy
responsive
to
leadership
susceptible
to
waves
of
emotion
of
a
high
religeous
voltage
quick
and
direct
in
action
the
volume
of
this
northern
movement
into
the
southern
uplands
is
illustrated
by
the
statement
of
governor
tryon
of
north
carolina
that
in
the
summer
and
winter
of
more
than
a
thousand
immigrant
wagons
passed
through
salisbury
in
that
colony
coming
by
families
or
groups
of
families
or
congregations
they
often
drove
their
herds
with
them
whereas
in
scarce
a
hundred
fighting
men
were
found
in
orange
and
the
western
counties
of
north
carolina
there
were
in
fully
three
thousand
in
addition
to
over
a
thousand
scotch
in
the
cumberland
and
they
covered
the
province
more
or
less
thickly
from
hillsboro
and
fayetteville
to
the
mountains
bassett
remarks
that
the
presbyterians
received
their
first
ministers
from
the
synod
of
new
york
and
pennsylvania
and
later
on
sent
their
ministerial
students
to
princeton
college
indeed
it
is
likely
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
region
knew
more
about
philadelphia
at
that
time
than
about
newbern
or
edenton
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
note
briefly
in
conclusion
some
of
the
results
of
the
occupation
of
this
new
frontier
during
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
some
of
the
consequences
of
this
formation
of
the
old
west
i
a
fighting
frontier
had
been
created
all
along
the
line
from
new
england
to
georgia
which
bore
the
brunt
of
french
and
indian
attacks
and
gave
indispensable
service
during
the
revolution
the
significance
of
this
fact
could
only
be
developed
by
an
extended
survey
of
the
scattered
border
warfare
of
this
era
we
should
have
to
see
rogers
leading
his
new
england
rangers
and
washington
defending
interior
virginia
with
his
frontiersmen
in
their
hunting
shirts
in
the
french
and
indian
war
when
all
of
the
campaigns
about
the
region
of
canada
lake
champlain
and
the
hudson
central
new
york
oriskany
cherry
valley
sullivan
expedition
against
the
iroquois
wyoming
valley
western
pennsylvania
the
virginia
valley
and
the
back
country
of
the
south
are
considered
as
a
whole
from
this
point
of
view
the
meaning
of
the
old
west
will
become
more
apparent
ii
a
new
society
had
been
established
differing
in
essentials
from
the
colonial
society
of
the
coast
it
was
a
democratic
primitive
agricultural
society
in
which
individualism
was
more
pronounced
than
the
community
life
of
the
lowlands
the
indented
servant
and
the
slave
were
not
a
normal
part
of
its
labor
system
it
was
engaged
in
grain
and
cattle
raising
not
in
producing
staples
and
it
found
a
partial
means
of
supplying
its
scarcity
of
specie
by
the
peltries
which
it
shipped
to
the
coast
but
the
hunter
folk
were
already
pushing
farther
on
the
and
the
range
were
giving
place
to
the
small
farm
as
in
our
own
day
they
have
done
in
the
cattle
country
it
was
a
region
of
hard
work
and
poverty
not
of
wealth
and
leisure
schools
and
churches
were
secured
under
serious
difficulty
if
at
all
but
in
spite
of
the
natural
tendencies
of
a
frontier
life
a
large
portion
of
the
interior
showed
a
distinctly
religious
atmosphere
iii
the
old
west
began
the
movement
of
internal
trade
which
developed
home
markets
and
diminished
that
colonial
dependence
on
europe
in
industrial
matters
shown
by
the
maritime
and
sections
not
only
did
boston
and
other
new
england
towns
increase
as
trading
centers
when
the
back
country
settled
up
but
an
even
more
significant
interchange
occurred
along
the
valley
and
piedmont
the
german
farmers
of
the
great
valley
brought
their
woven
linen
knitted
stockings
firkins
of
butter
dried
apples
grain
to
philadelphia
and
especially
to
baltimore
which
was
laid
out
in
to
this
city
also
came
trade
from
the
shenandoah
valley
and
even
from
the
piedmont
came
peltry
trains
and
droves
of
cattle
and
hogs
to
the
same
market
the
increase
of
settlement
on
the
upper
james
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
the
city
of
richmond
at
the
falls
of
the
river
in
already
the
aristocracy
of
the
lowlands
were
finding
rivals
in
the
area
of
interior
virginia
and
maryland
charleston
prospered
as
the
of
the
carolinas
grew
writing
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
governor
glenn
of
south
carolina
explained
the
apparent
diminution
of
the
colony
shipping
thus
our
trade
with
new
york
and
philadelphia
was
of
this
sort
draining
us
of
all
the
little
money
and
bills
that
we
could
gather
from
other
places
for
their
bread
flour
beer
hams
bacon
and
other
things
of
their
produce
all
which
except
beer
our
new
townships
begin
to
supply
us
with
which
are
settled
with
very
industrious
and
consequently
thriving
germans
it
was
not
long
before
this
interior
trade
produced
those
rivalries
for
commercial
ascendancy
between
the
coastwise
cities
which
still
continue
the
problem
of
internal
improvements
became
a
pressing
one
and
the
statutes
show
increasing
provision
for
roads
ferries
bridges
river
improvements
etc
the
basis
was
being
laid
for
a
national
economy
and
at
the
same
time
a
new
source
for
foreign
export
was
created
iv
the
old
west
raised
the
issues
of
nativism
and
a
lower
standard
of
comfort
in
new
england
presbyterians
had
been
frowned
upon
and
pushed
away
by
the
puritan
townsmen
in
pennsylvania
the
coming
of
the
germans
and
the
in
such
numbers
caused
grave
anxiety
indeed
a
bill
was
passed
to
limit
the
importation
of
the
palatines
but
it
was
vetoed
such
astute
observers
as
franklin
feared
in
that
pennsylvania
would
be
unable
to
preserve
its
language
and
that
even
its
government
would
become
precarious
i
remember
he
declares
when
they
modestly
declined
intermeddling
in
our
elections
but
now
they
come
in
droves
and
carry
all
before
them
except
in
one
or
two
counties
and
he
lamented
that
the
english
could
not
remove
their
prejudices
by
addressing
them
in
german
douglas
apprehended
that
pennsylvania
would
degenerate
into
a
foreign
colony
and
endanger
the
quiet
of
the
adjacent
provinces
edmund
burke
regretting
that
the
germans
adhered
to
their
own
schools
literature
and
language
and
that
they
possessed
great
tracts
without
admixture
of
english
feared
that
they
would
not
blend
and
become
one
people
with
the
british
colonists
and
that
the
colony
was
threatened
with
the
danger
of
being
wholly
foreign
he
also
noted
that
these
foreigners
by
their
industry
frugality
and
a
hard
way
of
living
in
which
they
greatly
exceed
our
people
have
in
a
manner
thrust
them
out
in
several
places
this
is
a
phenomenon
with
which
a
succession
of
later
frontiers
has
familiarized
us
in
point
of
fact
the
pennsylvania
dutch
remained
through
our
history
a
very
stubborn
area
to
assimilate
with
corresponding
effect
upon
pennsylvania
politics
it
should
be
noted
also
that
this
coming
of
stock
to
the
frontier
raised
in
all
the
colonies
affected
questions
of
naturalization
and
land
tenure
by
aliens
the
creation
of
this
frontier
society
of
which
so
large
a
portion
differed
from
that
of
the
coast
in
language
and
religion
as
well
as
in
economic
life
social
structure
and
ideals
produced
an
antagonism
between
interior
and
coast
which
worked
itself
out
in
interesting
fashion
in
general
this
took
these
forms
contests
between
the
class
of
the
coast
and
the
debtor
class
of
the
interior
where
specie
was
lacking
and
where
paper
money
and
a
readjustment
of
the
basis
of
taxation
were
demanded
contests
over
defective
or
unjust
local
government
in
the
administration
of
taxes
fees
lands
and
the
courts
contests
over
apportionment
in
the
legislature
whereby
the
coast
was
able
to
dominate
even
when
its
white
population
was
in
the
minority
contests
to
secure
the
complete
separation
of
church
and
state
and
later
contests
over
slavery
internal
improvements
and
party
politics
in
general
these
contests
are
also
intimately
connected
with
the
political
philosophy
of
the
revolution
and
with
the
development
of
american
democracy
in
nearly
every
colony
prior
to
the
revolution
struggles
had
been
in
progress
between
the
party
of
privilege
chiefly
the
eastern
men
of
property
allied
with
the
english
authorities
and
the
democratic
classes
strongest
in
the
west
and
the
cities
this
theme
deserves
more
space
than
can
here
be
allotted
to
it
but
a
rapid
survey
of
conditions
in
this
respect
along
the
whole
frontier
will
at
least
serve
to
bring
out
the
point
in
new
england
as
a
whole
the
contest
is
less
in
evidence
that
part
of
the
friction
elsewhere
seen
as
the
result
of
defective
local
government
in
the
back
country
was
met
by
the
efficiency
of
the
town
system
but
between
the
interior
and
the
coast
there
were
struggles
over
apportionment
and
religious
freedom
the
former
is
illustrated
by
the
convention
that
met
in
dracut
massachusetts
in
to
petition
the
states
of
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
to
relieve
the
financial
distress
and
unfair
legislative
representation
sixteen
of
the
border
towns
of
new
hampshire
sent
delegates
to
this
convention
two
years
later
these
new
hampshire
towns
attempted
to
join
vermont
as
a
revolutionary
state
vermont
itself
was
an
illustration
of
the
same
tendency
of
the
interior
to
break
away
from
the
coast
massachusetts
in
this
period
witnessed
a
campaign
between
the
paper

where
there
was

affords
a
clear

of
these
sectional
antagonisms
the

of

paxton
boys
in
demanded
a
right
to
share
in
political
privileges
with
the
older
part
of
the

and
protested
against
the
apportionment
by
which
the
counties
of
chester
bucks
and
philadelphia
together
with
the
city
of
philadelphia
elected
delegates
while
the
five
frontier
counties
had
but
ten
the
frontier
complained
against
the
failure
of
the
dominant
quaker
party
of
the
coast
to
protect
the
interior
against
the
indians
the
three
old
wealthy
counties
under
quaker
rule
feared
the
growth
of
the
west
therefore
made
few
new
counties
and
carefully
restricted
the
representation
in
each
to
preserve
the
majority
in
the
old
section
at
the
same
time
by
a
property
qualification
they
met
the
danger
of
the
democratic
city
population
among
the
points
of
grievance
in
this
colony
in
addition
to
apportionment
and
representation
was
the
difficulty
of
access
to
the
county
seat
owing
to
the
size
of
the
back
counties
lincoln
has
well
set
forth
the
struggle
of
the
back
country
culminating
in
its
triumph
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
which
was
chiefly
the
work
of
the
presbyterian
counties
indeed
there
were
two
revolutions
in
pennsylvania
which
went
on
side
by
side
one
a
revolt
against
the
coastal
classes
the
old
dominant
quaker
party
and
the
other
a
revolt
against
great
britain
which
was
in
this
colony
made
possible
only
by
the
triumph
of
the
interior
in
virginia
as
early
as
governor
spotswood
had
complained
that
the
old
counties
remained
small
while
the
new
ones
were
sometimes
ninety
miles
long
the
inhabitants
being
obliged
to
travel
thirty
or
forty
miles
to
their
own
some
of
the
counties
had
tithables
while
others
only
a
dozen
miles
square
had
justices
of
the
peace
disliked
to
ride
forty
or
fifty
miles
to
their
monthly
courts
likewise
there
was
disparity
in
the
size
of
parishes
for
example
that
of
varina
on
the
upper
james
had
nine
hundred
tithables
many
of
whom
lived
fifty
miles
from
their
church
but
the
vestry
refused
to
allow
the
remote
parishioners
to
separate
because
it
would
increase
the
parish
levy
of
those
that
remained
he
feared
lest
this
would
afford
opportunity
to
sectarys
to
establish
their
opinions
among
and
thereby
shake
that
happy
establishment
of
the
church
of
england
which
this
colony
enjoys
with
less
mixture
of
dissenters
than
any
other
of
her
plantations
and
when
once
schism
has
crept
into
the
church
it
will
soon
create
faction
in
the
civil
government
that
spotswood
fears
were
well
founded
we
have
already
seen
as
the
sectaries
of
the
back
country
increased
dissatisfaction
with
the
established
church
grew
after
the
revolution
came
jefferson
with
the
back
country
behind
him
was
able
finally
to
destroy
the
establishment
and
to
break
down
the
system
of
entails
and
primogeniture
behind
which
the
aristocracy
of
the
coast
was
entrenched
the
desire
of
jefferson
to
see
slavery
gradually
abolished
and
popular
education
provided
is
a
further
illustration
of
the
attitude
of
the
interior
in
short
jeffersonian
democracy
with
its
idea
of
separation
of
church
and
state
its
wish
to
popularize
education
and
its
dislike
for
special
privilege
was
deeply
affected
by
the
western
society
of
the
old
dominion
the
virginian
reform
movement
however
was
unable
to
redress
the
grievance
of
unequal
apportionment
in
jefferson
pointed
out
that
the
practice
of
allowing
each
county
an
equal
representation
in
the
legislature
gave
control
to
the
numerous
small
counties
of
the
tidewater
while
the
large
populous
counties
of
the
suffered
thus
he
wrote
the
men
below
the
falls
give
law
to
more
than
living
in
other
parts
of
the
state
and
appoint
all
their
chief
officers
executive
and
judiciary
this
led
to
a
long
struggle
between
coast
and
interior
terminated
only
when
the
slave
population
passed
across
the
fall
line
and
more
nearly
assimilated
coast
and
in
the
mountain
areas
which
did
not
undergo
this
change
the
independent
state
of
west
virginia
remains
as
a
monument
of
the
contest
in
the
convention
of
the
whole
philosophy
of
representation
was
discussed
and
the
coast
defended
its
control
as
necessary
to
protect
property
from
the
assaults
of
a
numerical
majority
they
feared
that
the
interior
would
tax
their
slaves
in
order
to
secure
funds
for
internal
improvements
as
doddridge
put
the
case
the
principle
is
that
the
owners
of
slave
property
must
be
possessed
of
all
the
powers
of
government
however
small
their
own
numbers
may
be
to
secure
that
property
from
the
rapacity
of
an
overgrown
majority
of
white
men
this
principle
admits
of
no
relaxation
because
the
weaker
the
minority
becomes
the
greater
will
their
need
for
power
be
according
to
their
own
doctrines
leigh
of
chesterfield
county
declared
it
is
remarkable
i
mention
it
for
the
curiosity
of
the
fact
that
if
any
evil
physical
or
moral
arise
in
any
of
the
states
south
of
us
it
never
takes
a
northerly
direction
or
taints
the
southern
breeze
whereas
if
any
plague
originate
in
the
north
it
is
sure
to
spread
to
the
south
and
to
invade
us
sooner
or
later
the
influenza
the
smallpox
the
varioloid
the
hessian
fly
the
circuit
court
system
universal
suffrage
all
come
from
the
north
they
always
cross
above
the
falls
of
the
great
below
it
seems
the
broad
expanse
of
waters
interposing
effectually
arrests
their
progress
nothing
could
more
clearly
bring
out
the
sense
of
contrast
between
upland
and
lowland
virginia
and
the
continued
intimacy
of
the
bond
of
connection
between
the
north
and
its
valley
and
piedmont
colonies
than
this
unconscious
testimony
in
north
and
south
carolina
the
upland
south
beyond
the
pine
barrens
and
the
fall
line
had
similar
grievances
against
the
coast
but
as
the
zone
of
separation
was
more
strongly
marked
the
grievances
were
more
acute
the
tide
of
backwoods
settlement
flowing
down
the
piedmont
from
the
north
had
cut
across
the
lines
of
local
government
and
disarranged
the
regular
course
of
development
of
the
colonies
from
the
seacoast
under
the
common
practice
large
counties
in
north
carolina
and
parishes
in
south
carolina
had
been
projected
into
the
unoccupied
interior
from
the
older
settlements
along
their
eastern
edge
but
the
piedmont
settlers
brought
their
own
social
order
and
could
not
be
well
governed
by
the
older
planters
living
far
away
toward
the
seaboard
this
may
be
illustrated
by
conditions
in
south
carolina
the
general
court
in
charleston
had
absorbed
county
and
precinct
courts
except
the
minor
jurisdiction
of
justices
of
the
peace
this
was
well
enough
for
the
great
planters
who
made
their
regular
residence
there
for
a
part
of
each
year
but
it
was
a
source
of
oppression
to
the
settlers
remote
from
the
court
the
difficulty
of
bringing
witnesses
the
delay
of
the
law
and
the
costs
all
resulted
in
the
escape
of
criminals
as
well
as
in
the
immunity
of
reckless
debtors
the
extortions
of
officials
and
their
occasional
collusion
with
horse
and
cattle
thieves
and
the
lack
of
regular
administration
of
the
law
led
the
south
carolina
men
to
take
affairs
in
their
own
hands
and
in
to
establish
associations
to
administer
lynch
law
under
the
name
of
regulators
the
scovillites
or
government
party
and
the
regulators
met
in
arms
on
the
saluda
in
but
hostilities
were
averted
and
remedial
measures
passed
which
alleviated
the
difficulty
until
the
revolution
there
still
remained
however
the
grievance
of
unjust
legislative
representation
calhoun
stated
the
condition
in
these
words
the
upper
country
had
no
representation
in
the
government
and
no
political
existence
as
a
constituent
portion
of
the
state
until
a
period
near
the
commencement
of
the
revolution
indeed
during
the
revolution
and
until
the
formation
of
the
present
constitution
in
its
political
weight
was
scarcely
felt
in
the
government
even
then
although
it
had
become
the
most
populous
section
power
was
so
distributed
under
the
constitution
as
to
leave
it
in
a
minority
in
every
department
of
government
even
in
it
was
claimed
by
the
leaders
that
of
the
people
were
governed
by
nor
was
the
difficulty
met
until
the
constitutional
amendment
of
the
effect
of
which
was
to
give
the
control
of
the
senate
to
the
lower
section
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
to
the
upper
section
thus
providing
a
mutual
veto
this
south
carolina
experience
furnished
the
historical
basis
for
calhoun
argument
for
nullification
and
for
the
political
philosophy
underlying
his
theory
of
the
concurrent
majority
this
adjustment
was
effected
however
only
after
the
advance
of
the
black
belt
toward
the
interior
had
assimilated
portions
of
the
piedmont
to
lowland
ideals
when
we
turn
to
north
carolina
upper
country
we
find
the
familiar
story
but
with
a
more
tragic
ending
the
local
officials
owed
their
selection
to
the
governor
and
the
council
whom
he
appointed
thus
power
was
all
concentrated
in
the
official
ring
of
the
lowland
area
the
men
of
the
interior
resented
the
extortionate
fees
and
the
poll
tax
which
bore
with
unequal
weight
upon
the
poor
settlers
of
the
back
country
this
tax
had
been
continued
after
sufficient
funds
had
been
collected
to
extinguish
the
debt
for
which
it
was
originally
levied
but
venal
sheriffs
had
failed
to
pay
it
into
the
treasury
a
report
of
showed
at
least
one
defaulting
sheriff
in
every
county
of
the
province
this
tax
which
was
almost
the
sole
tax
of
the
colony
was
to
be
collected
in
specie
for
the
warehouse
system
by
which
staples
might
be
accepted
while
familiar
on
the
coast
did
not
apply
to
the
interior
the
specie
was
exceedingly
difficult
to
obtain
in
lack
of
it
the
farmer
saw
the
sheriff
who
owed
his
appointment
to
the
dominant
lowland
planters
sell
the
lands
of
the
delinquent
to
his
speculative
friends
lawyers
and
court
fees
followed
in
short
the
interior
felt
that
it
was
being
exploited
and
it
had
no
redress
for
the
legislature
was
so
apportioned
that
all
power
rested
in
the
old
lowland
region
efforts
to
secure
paper
money
failed
by
reason
of
the
governor
opposition
under
instructions
from
the
crown
and
the
currency
was
contracting
at
the
very
time
when
population
was
rapidly
increasing
in
the
interior
as
in
new
england
in
the
days
of
shays
rebellion
violent
prejudice
existed
against
the
judiciary
and
the
lawyers
and
it
must
of
course
be
understood
that
the
movement
was
not
free
from
frontier
dislike
of
taxation
and
the
restraints
of
law
and
order
in
general
in
and
meetings
were
held
in
the
upper
counties
to
organize
the
opposition
and
an
association
was
formed
the
members
of
which
pledged
themselves
to
pay
no
more
taxes
or
fees
until
they
satisfied
themselves
that
these
were
agreeable
to
law
the
regulators
as
they
called
themselves
assembled
in
the
autumn
of
to
the
number
of
nearly
four
thousand
and
tried
to
secure
terms
of
adjustment
in
the
at
hillsboro
was
broken
into
by
a
mob
the
assembly
passed
some
measures
designed
to
conciliate
the
back
country
but
before
they
became
operative
governor
tryon
militia
about
twelve
hundred
men
largely
from
the
lowlands
and
led
by
the
gentry
whose
privileges
were
involved
met
the
motley
army
of
the
regulators
who
numbered
about
two
thousand
in
the
battle
of
the
alamance
may
many
were
killed
and
wounded
the
regulators
dispersed
and
over
six
thousand
men
came
into
camp
and
took
the
oath
of
submission
to
the
colonial
authorities
the
battle
was
not
the
first
battle
of
the
revolution
as
it
has
been
sometimes
called
for
it
had
little
or
no
relation
to
the
stamp
act
and
many
of
the
frontiersmen
involved
later
refused
to
fight
against
england
because
of
the
very
hatred
which
had
been
inspired
for
the
lowland
revolutionary
leaders
in
this
battle
of
the
alamance
the
interior
of
the
carolinas
was
a
region
where
neighbors
during
the
revolution
engaged
in
internecine
conflicts
of
tories
against
whigs
but
in
the
sense
that
the
battle
of
alamance
was
a
conflict
against
privilege
and
for
equality
of
political
rights
and
power
it
was
indeed
a
preliminary
battle
of
the
revolution
although
fought
against
many
of
the
very
men
who
later
professed
revolutionary
doctrines
in
north
carolina
the
need
of
recognizing
the
importance
of
the
interior
led
to
concessions
in
the
convention
of
in
that
state
of
the
sections
of
the
constitution
thirteen
are
embodiments
of
reforms
sought
by
the
regulators
but
it
was
in
this
period
that
hundreds
of
north
carolina
backwoodsmen
crossed
the
mountains
to
tennessee
and
kentucky
many
of
them
coming
from
the
heart
of
the
regulator
region
they
used
the
device
of
associations
to
provide
for
government
in
their
communities
in
the
matter
of
apportionment
north
carolina
showed
the
same
lodgment
of
power
in
the
hands
of
the
coast
even
after
population
preponderated
in
the
piedmont
it
is
needless
to
comment
on
the
uniformity
of
the
evidence
which
has
been
adduced
to
show
that
the
old
west
the
interior
region
from
new
england
to
georgia
had
a
common
grievance
against
the
coast
that
it
was
deprived
throughout
most
of
the
region
of
its
due
share
of
representation
and
neglected
and
oppressed
in
local
government
in
large
portions
of
the
section
the
familiar
struggle
of
west
against
east
of
democracy
against
privileged
classes
was
exhibited
along
the
entire
line
the
phenomenon
must
be
considered
as
a
unit
not
in
the
fragments
of
state
histories
it
was
a
struggle
of
interior
against
coast
vi
perhaps
the
most
noteworthy
western
activity
in
the
revolutionary
era
aside
from
the
aspects
already
mentioned
was
in
the
part
which
the
multitude
of
sects
in
the
old
west
played
in
securing
the
great
contribution
which
the
united
states
made
to
civilization
by
providing
for
complete
religious
liberty
a
secular
state
with
free
churches
particularly
the
revolutionary
constitutions
of
pennsylvania
and
virginia
under
the
influence
of
the
back
country
insured
religious
freedom
the
effects
of
the
north
carolina
upland
area
to
secure
a
similar
result
were
noteworthy
though
for
the
time
ineffective
vii
as
population
increased
in
these
years
the
coast
gradually
yielded
to
the
demands
this
may
be
illustrated
by
the
transfer
of
the
capitals
from
the
lowlands
to
the
fall
line
and
valley
in
virginia
changed
her
seat
of
government
from
williamsburg
to
richmond
in
south
carolina
from
charleston
to
columbia
in
north
carolina
from
edenton
to
raleigh
in
new
york
from
new
york
city
to
albany
in
pennsylvania
from
philadelphia
to
lancaster
viii
the
democratic
aspect
of
the
new
constitutions
was
also
influenced
by
the
frontier
as
well
as
by
the
prevalent
revolutionary
philosophy
and
the
demands
for
paper
money
stay
and
tender
laws
of
this
period
were
strongest
in
the
interior
it
was
this
region
that
supported
shays
rebellion
it
was
with
some
important
exceptions
the
same
area
that
resisted
the
ratification
of
the
federal
constitution
fearful
of
a
stronger
government
and
of
the
loss
of
paper
money
ix
the
interior
later
showed
its
opposition
to
the
coast
by
the
persistent
contest
against
slavery
carried
on
in
the
of
virginia
and
north
and
south
carolina
until
the
decade
it
was
not
certain
that
both
virginia
and
north
carolina
would
not
find
some
means
of
gradual
abolition
the
same
influence
accounts
for
much
of
the
exodus
of
the
piedmont
pioneers
into
indiana
and
illinois
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
x
these
were
the
regions
also
in
which
were
developed
the
desire
of
the
pioneers
who
crossed
the
mountains
and
settled
on
the
western
waters
to
establish
new
states
free
from
control
by
the
lowlands
owning
their
own
lands
able
to
determine
their
own
currency
and
in
general
to
govern
themselves
in
accordance
with
the
ideals
of
the
old
west
they
were
ready
also
if
need
be
to
become
independent
of
the
old
thirteen
vermont
must
be
considered
in
this
aspect
as
well
as
kentucky
and
tennessee
xi
the
land
system
of
the
old
west
furnished
precedents
which
developed
into
the
land
system
of
the
west
the
squatters
of
pennsylvania
and
the
carolinas
found
it
easy
to
repeat
the
operation
on
another
frontier
preëmption
laws
became
established
features
the
revolution
gave
opportunity
to
confiscate
the
claims
of
lord
fairfax
lord
granville
and
mcculloh
to
their
vast
estates
as
well
as
the
remaining
lands
of
the
pennsylvania
proprietors
the
acre
or
one
square
mile
unit
of
north
carolina
for
preëmptions
and
frontier
land
bounties
became
the
area
awarded
to
frontier
stations
by
virginia
in
and
the
section
of
the
later
federal
land
system
the
virginia
preëmption
right
of
four
hundred
acres
on
the
western
waters
or
a
thousand
for
those
who
came
prior
to
was
in
substance
the
continuation
of
a
system
familiar
in
the
old
west
the
grants
to
beverley
of
over
a
hundred
thousand
acres
in
the
valley
conditioned
on
seating
a
family
for
every
thousand
acres
and
the
similar
grants
to
borden
carter
and
lewis
were
followed
by
the
great
grant
to
the
ohio
company
this
company
including
leading
virginia
planters
and
some
frontiersmen
asked
in
for
two
hundred
thousand
acres
on
the
upper
ohio
conditioned
on
seating
a
hundred
families
in
seven
years
and
for
an
additional
grant
of
three
hundred
thousand
acres
after
this
should
be
accomplished
it
was
proposed
to
settle
germans
on
these
lands
the
loyal
land
company
by
order
of
the
virginia
council
was
authorized
to
take
up
eight
hundred
thousand
acres
west
and
north
of
the
southern
boundary
of
virginia
on
condition
of
purchasing
rights
for
the
amount
within
four
years
the
company
sold
many
tracts
for
per
hundred
acres
to
settlers
but
finally
lost
its
claim
the
mississippi
company
including
in
its
membership
the
lees
washingtons
and
other
great
virginia
planters
applied
for
two
and
million
acres
in
the
west
in
similar
land
companies
of
new
england
origin
like
the
susquehanna
company
and
lyman
mississippi
company
exhibit
the
same
tendency
of
the
old
west
on
the
northern
side
new
england
ohio
company
of
associates
which
settled
marietta
had
striking
resemblances
to
town
proprietors
these
were
only
the
most
noteworthy
of
many
companies
of
this
period
and
it
is
evident
that
they
were
a
natural
outgrowth
of
speculations
in
the
old
west
washington
securing
military
bounty
land
claims
of
soldiers
of
the
french
and
indian
war
and
selecting
lands
in
west
virginia
until
he
controlled
over
seventy
thousand
acres
for
speculation
is
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
tendency
he
also
thought
of
colonizing
german
palatines
upon
his
lands
the
formation
of
the
transylvania
and
vandalia
companies
were
natural
developments
on
a
still
vaster
scale
xii
the
final
phase
of
the
old
west
which
i
wish
merely
to
mention
in
conclusion
is
its
colonization
of
areas
beyond
the
mountains
the
essential
unity
of
the
movement
is
brought
out
by
a
study
of
how
new
england
old
west
settled
northern
maine
new
hampshire
and
vermont
the
adirondacks
central
and
western
new
york
the
wyoming
valley
once
organized
as
a
part
of
litchfield
connecticut
the
ohio
region
about
marietta
and
connecticut
western
reserve
on
the
shores
of
lake
erie
and
how
the
pioneers
of
the
great
valley
and
the
piedmont
region
of
the
south
crossed
the
alleghanies
and
settled
on
the
western
waters
daniel
boone
going
from
his
pennsylvania
home
to
the
yadkin
and
from
the
yadkin
to
tennessee
and
kentucky
took
part
in
the
whole
process
and
later
in
its
continuation
into
missouri
the
social
conditions
and
ideals
of
the
old
west
powerfully
shaped
those
of
the
west
the
important
contrast
between
the
spirit
of
individual
colonization
resentful
of
control
which
the
southern
frontiersmen
showed
and
the
spirit
of
community
colonization
and
control
to
which
the
new
england
pioneers
inclined
left
deep
traces
on
the
later
history
of
the
west
the
old
west
diminished
the
importance
of
the
town
as
a
colonizing
unit
even
in
new
england
in
the
southern
area
efforts
to
legislate
towns
into
existence
as
in
virginia
south
carolina
and
georgia
failed
they
faded
away
before
wilderness
conditions
but
in
general
the
northern
stream
of
migration
was
communal
and
the
southern
individual
the
difference
which
existed
between
that
portion
of
the
old
west
which
was
formed
by
the
northward
colonization
chiefly
of
the
new
england
plateau
including
new
york
and
that
portion
formed
by
the
southward
colonization
of
the
virginia
valley
and
the
southern
piedmont
was
reflected
in

of

iv
the
middle
west
american
sectional
nomenclature
is
still
confused
once
the
west
described
the
whole
region
beyond
the
alleghanies
but
the
term
has
hopelessly
lost
its
definiteness
the
rapidity
of
the
spread
of
settlement
has
broken
down
old
usage
and
as
yet
no
substitute
has
been
generally
accepted
the
middle
west
is
a
term
variously
used
by
the
public
but
for
the
purpose
of
the
present
paper
it
will
be
applied
to
that
region
of
the
united
states
included
in
the
census
reports
under
the
name
of
the
north
central
division
comprising
the
states
of
ohio

illinois
michigan
and
wisconsin

and
their

it
is
an
imperial

if
the
greater
countries
of

europe
france
germany
italy

were
laid
down
upon
this

the

would
still
show
a

great
as
are
the

middle

it
possesses
in
its
physiography
in
the
history
of
its
settlement
and
in
its
economic
and
social
life
a
unity
and
interdependence
which
warrant
a
study
of
the
area
as
an
entity
within
the
limits
of
this
article
treatment
of
so
vast
a
region
however
can
at
best
afford
no
more
than
an
outline
sketch
in
which
old
and
facts
must
if
possible
be
so
grouped
as
to
explain
the
position
of
the
section
in
american
history
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
of
the
task
there
is
a
definite
advantage
in
so
large
a
view
by
fixing
our
attention
too
exclusively
upon
the
artificial
boundary
lines
of
the
states
we
have
failed
to
perceive
much
that
is
significant
in
the
westward
development
of
the
united
states
for
instance
our
colonial
system
did
not
begin
with
the
spanish
war
the
united
states
has
had
a
colonial
history
and
policy
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic
but
they
have
been
hidden
under
the
phraseology
of
interstate
migration
and
territorial
organization
the
american
people
have
occupied
a
spacious
wilderness
vast
physiographic
provinces
each
with
its
own
peculiarities
have
lain
across
the
path
of
this
migration
and
each
has
furnished
a
special
environment
for
economic
and
social
transformation
it
is
possible
to
underestimate
the
importance
of
state
lines
but
if
we
direct
our
gaze
rather
to
the
physiographic
province
than
to
the
state
area
we
shall
be
able
to
see
some
facts
in
a
new
light
then
it
becomes
clear
that
these
physiographic
provinces
of
america
are
in
some
respects
comparable
to
the
countries
of
europe
and
that
each
has
its
own
history
of
occupation
and
development
general
francis
walker
once
remarked
that
the
course
of
settlement
has
called
upon
our
people
to
occupy
territory
as
extensive
as
switzerland
as
england
as
italy
and
latterly
as
france
or
germany
every
ten
years
it
is
this
element
of
vastness
in
the
achievements
of
american
democracy
that
gives
a
peculiar
interest
to
the
conquest
and
development
of
the
middle
west
the
effects
of
this
conquest
and
development
upon
the
present
united
states
have
been
of
fundamental
importance
geographically
the
middle
west
is
almost
conterminous
with
the
provinces
of
the
lake
and
prairie
plains
but
the
larger
share
of
kansas
and
nebraska
and
the
western
part
of
the
two
dakotas
belong
to
the
great
plains
the
ozark
mountains
occupy
a
portion
of
missouri
and
the
southern
parts
of
ohio
and
indiana
merge
into
the
alleghany
plateau
the
relation
of
the
provinces
of
the
lake
and
prairie
plains
to
the
rest
of
the
united
states
is
an
important
element
in
the
significance
of
the
middle
west
on
the
north
lies
the
similar
region
of
canada
the
great
lakes
are
in
the
center
of
the
whole
eastern
and
more
thickly
settled
half
of
north
america
and
they
bind
the
canadian
and
middle
western
people
together
on
the
south
the
provinces
meet
the
apex
of
that
of
the
gulf
plains
and
the
mississippi
unites
them
to
the
west
they
merge
gradually
into
the
great
plains
the
missouri
and
its
tributaries
and
the
pacific
railroads
make
for
them
a
bond
of
union
another
rather
effective
bond
is
the
interdependence
of
the
cattle
of
the
plains
and
the
corn
of
the
prairies
to
the
east
the
province
meets
the
alleghany
and
new
england
plateaus
and
is
connected
with
them
by
the
upper
ohio
and
by
the
line
of
the
erie
canal
here
the
interaction
of
industrial
life
and
the
historical
facts
of
settlement
have
produced
a
close
relationship
the
intimate
connection
between
the
larger
part
of
the
north
central
and
the
north
atlantic
divisions
of
the
united
states
will
impress
any
one
who
examines
the
industrial
and
social
maps
of
the
census
atlas
by
reason
of
these
interprovincial
relationships
the
middle
west
is
the
mediator
between
canada
and
the
united
states
and
between
the
concentrated
wealth
and
manufactures
of
the
north
atlantic
states
and
the
sparsely
settled
western
mining
and
agricultural
states
it
has
a
connection
with
the
south
that
was
once
still
closer
and
is
likely
before
long
to
reassert
itself
with
new
power
within
the
limits
of
the
united
states
therefore
we
have
problems
of
interprovincial
trade
and
commerce
similar
to
those
that
exist
between
the
nations
of
the
old
world
over
most
of
the
province
of
the
lake
and
prairie
plains
the
laurentide
glacier
spread
its
drift
rich
in
limestone
and
other
rock
powder
which
farmers
in
less
favored
sections
must
purchase
to
replenish
the
soil
the
alluvial
deposit
from
primeval
lakes
contributed
to
fatten
the
soil
of
other
parts
of
the
prairies
taken
as
a
whole
the
prairie
plains
surpass
in
fertility
any
other
region
of
america
or
europe
unless
we
except
some
territory
about
the
black
sea
it
is
a
land
marked
out
as
the
granary
of
the
nation
but
it
is
more
than
a
granary
on
the
rocky
shores
of
lake
superior
were
concealed
copper
mines
rivaled
only
by
those
of
montana
and
iron
fields
which
now
furnish
the
ore
for
the
production
of
eighty
per
cent
of
the
pig
iron
of
the
united
states
the
great
lakes
afford
a
highway
between
these
iron
fields
and
the
coal
areas
of
the
ohio
valley
the
gas
and
oil
deposits
of
the
ohio
valley
the
coal
of
illinois
iowa
michigan
and
eastern
kansas
the
lead
and
zinc
of
the
ozark
region
and
of
the
upper
mississippi
valley
and
the
gold
of
the
black
hills
all
contribute
underground
wealth
to
the
middle
west
the
primeval
american
forest
once
spread
its
shade
over
vast
portions
of
the
same
province
ohio
indiana
southern
michigan
and
central
wisconsin
were
almost
covered
with
a
growth
of
noble
deciduous
trees
in
southern
illinois
along
the
broad
bottom
lands
of
the
mississippi
and
the
illinois
and
in
southern
and
southwestern
missouri
similar
forests
prevailed
to
the
north
in
michigan
wisconsin
and
minnesota
appeared
the
somber
white
pine
wilderness
interlaced
with
hard
woods
which
swept
in
ample
zone
along
the
great
lakes
till
the
deciduous
forests
triumphed
again
and
in
their
turn
faded
into
the
treeless
expanse
of
the
prairies
in
the
remaining
portions
were
openings
in
the
midst
of
the
forested
area
and
then
the
grassy
ocean
of
prairie
that
rolled
to
west
and
northwest
until
it
passed
beyond
the
line
of
sufficient
rainfall
for
agriculture
without
irrigation
into
the
stretches
of
the
great
plains
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
forested
region
of
this
province
was
occupied
by
the
wigwams
of
many
different
tribes
of
the
algonquin
tongue
sparsely
scattered
in
villages
along
the
water
courses
warring
and
trading
through
the
vast
wilderness
the
western
edge
of
the
prairie
and
the
great
plains
were
held
by
the
sioux
chasing
herds
of
bison
across
these
expanses
these
horsemen
of
the
plains
and
the
canoemen
of
the
great
lakes
and
the
ohio
were
factors
with
which
civilization
had
to
reckon
for
they
constituted
important
portions
of
perhaps
the
fiercest
native
race
with
which
the
white
man
has
ever
battled
for
new
lands
the
frenchman
had
done
but
little
fighting
for
this
region
he
swore
brotherhood
with
its
savages
traded
with
them
intermarried
with
them
and
explored
the
middle
west
but
he
left
the
wilderness
much
as
he
found
it
some
six
or
seven
thousand
french
people
in
all
about
detroit
and
vincennes
and
in
the
illinois
country
and
scattered
among
the
indian
villages
of
the
remote
lakes
and
streams
held
possession
when
george
washington
reached
the
site
of
pittsburgh
bearing
summons
of
eviction
to
france
in
his
person
fate
knocked
at
the
portals
of
a
rising
empire
france
hurried
her
commanders
and
garrisons
with
indian
allies
from
the
posts
about
the
great
lakes
and
the
upper
mississippi
but
it
was
in
vain
in
vain
too
the
aftermath
of
pontiac
widespread
indian
uprising
against
the
english
occupation
when
she
came
into
possession
of
the
lands
between
the
ohio
the
mississippi
and
the
great
lakes
england
organized
them
as
a
part
of
the
province
of
quebec
the
daring
conquest
of
george
rogers
clark
left
virginia
in
military
possession
of
the
illinois
country
at
the
conclusion
of
the
revolutionary
war
but
over
all
the
remainder
of
the
old
northwest
england
was
in
control
although
she
ceded
the
region
by
the
treaty
which
closed
the
revolution
she
remained
for
many
years
the
mistress
of
the
indians
and
the
fur
trade
when
lord
shelburne
was
upbraided
in
parliament
for
yielding
the
northwest
to
the
united
states
the
complaint
was
that
he
had
clothed
the
americans
in
the
warm
covering
of
our
fur
trade
and
his
defense
was
that
the
peltry
trade
of
the
ceded
tract
was
not
sufficiently
profitable
to
warrant
further
war
but
the
english
government
became
convinced
that
the
indian
trade
demanded
the
retention
of
the
northwest
and
she
did
in
fact
hold
her
posts
there
in
spite
of
the
treaty
of
peace
dundas
the
english
secretary
for
the
colonies
expressed
the
policy
when
he
declared
in
that
the
object
was
to
interpose
an
indian
barrier
between
canada
and
the
united
states
and
in
pursuance
of
this
policy
of
preserving
the
northwest
as
an
indian
buffer
state
the
canadian
authorities
supported
the
indians
in
their
resistance
to
american
settlement
beyond
the
ohio
the
conception
of
the
northwest
as
an
indian
reserve
strikingly
exhibits
england
inability
to
foresee
the
future
of
the
region
and
to
measure
the
forces
of
american
expansion
by
the
cessions
of
virginia
new
york
massachusetts
and
connecticut
the
old
congress
had
come
into
nominal
possession
of
an
extensive
public
domain
and
a
field
for
the
exercise
of
national
authority
the
significance
of
this
fact
in
the
development
of
national
power
is
not
likely
to
be
overestimated
the
first
result
was
the
completion
of
the
ordinance
of
which
provided
a
territorial
government
for
the
old
northwest
with
provisions
for
the
admission
of
states
into
the
union
this
federal
colonial
system
guaranteed
that
the
new
national
possessions
should
not
be
governed
as
dependent
provinces
but
should
enter
as
a
group
of
sister
states
into
the
federation
while
the
importance
of
the
article
excluding
slavery
has
often
been
pointed
out
it
is
probable
that
the
provisions
for
a
federal
colonial
organization
have
been
at
least
equally
potential
in
our
actual
development
the
full
significance
of
this
feature
of
the
ordinance
is
only
appreciated
when
we
consider
its
continuous
influence
upon
the
american
territorial
and
state
policy
in
the
westward
expansion
to
the
pacific
and
the
political
preconceptions
with
which
americans
approach
the
problems
of
government
in
the
new
insular
possessions
the
land
ordinance
of
is
also
worthy
of
attention
in
this
connection
for
under
its
provisions
almost
all
of
the
middle
west
has
been
divided
by
the
government
surveyor
into
rectangles
of
sections
and
townships
by
whose
lines
the
settler
has
been
able
easily
and
certainly
to
locate
his
farm
and
the
forester
his
forty
in
the
local
organization
of
the
middle
west
these
lines
have
played
an
important
part
it
would
be
impossible
within
the
limits
of
this
paper
to
detail
the
history
of
the
occupation
of
the
middle
west
but
the
larger
aspects
of
the
flow
of
population
into
the
region
may
be
sketched
massachusetts
men
had
formed
the
ohio
company
and
had
been
influential
in
shaping
the
liberal
provisions
of
the
ordinance
their
land
purchase
paid
for
in
soldiers
certificates
embraced
an
area
larger
than
the
state
of
rhode
island
at
marietta
in
under
the
shelter
of
fort
harmar
their
barge
landed
the
first
new
england
colony
a
new
jersey
colony
was
planted
soon
after
at
cincinnati
in
the
symmes
purchase
thus
american
civilization
crossed
the
ohio
the
french
settlements
at
detroit
and
in
indiana
and
illinois
belonged
to
other
times
and
had
their
own

farther

had
released
additional

in

pioneers
were
widening
the
bounds
of

settlements
avoiding
the
rich
savannas
of
the

regions
as
devoid
of

remote
from

suited

to

represents
the

period
but
his
ax
sank
deeper
than
other
men
and
the
plaster
cast
of
his
great
sinewy
hand
at
washington
embodies
the
training
of
these
frontier
railsplitters
in
the
days
when
fort
dearborn
on
the
site
of
chicago
was
but
a
military
outpost
in
a
desolate
country
while
the
hard
woods
of
illinois
were
being
entered
the
pioneer
movement
passed
also
into
the
missouri
valley
the
french
lead
miners
had
already
opened
the
southeastern
section
and
southern
mountaineers
had
pushed
up
the
missouri
but
now
the
planters
from
the
ohio
valley
and
the
upper
tennessee
followed
seeking
the
alluvial
soils
for
slave
labor
moving
across
the
southern
border
of
free
illinois
they
had
awakened
regrets
in
that
state
at
the
loss
of
so
large
a
body
of
settlers
looking
at
the
middle
west
as
a
whole
in
the
decade
from
to
we
perceive
that
settlement
extended
from
the
shores
of
lake
erie
in
an
arc
following
the
banks
of
the
ohio
till
it
joined
the
mississippi
and
thence
along
that
river
and
up
the
missouri
well
into
the
center
of
the
state
the
next
decade
was
marked
by
the
increased
use
of
the
steamboat
pioneers
pressed
farther
up
the
streams
etching
out
the
hard
wood
forests
well
up
to
the
prairie
lands
and
forming
additional
tracts
of
settlement
in
the
region
tributary
to
detroit
and
in
the
southeastern
part
of
michigan
in
the
area
of
the
galena
lead
mines
of
northwestern
illinois
southwestern
wisconsin
and
northeastern
iowa
southerners
had
already
begun
operations
and
if
we
except
ohio
and
michigan
the
dominant
element
in
all
this
overflow
of
settlement
into
the
middle
west
was
southern
particularly
from
kentucky
virginia
and
north
carolina
the
settlements
were
still
dependent
on
the
rivers
for
transportation
and
the
areas
between
the
rivers
were
but
lightly
occupied
the
mississippi
constituted
the
principal
outlet
for
the
products
of
the
middle
west
pittsburgh
furnished
most
of
the
supplies
for
the
region
but
new
orleans
received
its
crops
the
old
national
road
was
built
piecemeal
and
too
late
as
a
whole
to
make
a
great
artery
of
trade
throughout
the
middle
west
in
this
early
period
but
it
marked
the
northern
borders
of
the
southern
stream
of
population
running
as
this
did
through
columbus
indianapolis
and
vandalia
the
twenty
years
from
to
saw
great
changes
in
the
composition
of
the
population
of
the
middle
west
the
opening
of
the
erie
canal
in
was
an
event
it
furnished
a
new
outlet
and
inlet
for
northwestern
traffic
buffalo
began
to
grow
and
new
york
city
changed
from
a
local
market
to
a
great
commercial
center
but
even
more
important
was
the
place
which
the
canal
occupied
as
the
highway
for
a
new
migration
in
the
march
of
the
new
england
people
from
the
coast
three
movements
are
of
especial
importance
the
advance
from
the
seaboard
up
the
connecticut
and
housatonic
valleys
through
massachusetts
and
into
vermont
the
advance
thence
to
central
and
western
new
york
and
the
advance
to
the
interior
of
the
old
northwest
the
second
of
these
stages
occupied
the
generation
from
about
to
after
that
the
second
generation
was
ready
to
seek
new
lands
and
these
the
erie
canal
and
lake
navigation
opened
to
them
and
to
the
vermonters
and
other
adventurous
spirits
of
new
england
it
was
this
combined
new
england
stream
that
in
the
thirties
poured
in
large
volume
into
the
zone
north
of
the
settlements
which
have
been
described
the
newcomers
filled
in
the
southern
counties
of
michigan
and
wisconsin
the
northern
countries
of
illinois
and
parts
of
the
northern
and
central
areas
of
indiana
pennsylvania
and
ohio
sent
a
similar
type
of
people
to
the
area
adjacent
to
those
states
in
iowa
a
stream
combined
of
the
southern
element
and
of
these
settlers
sought
the
wooded
tributaries
of
the
mississippi
in
the
southeastern
part
of
the
state
in
default
of
legal
authority
in
this
early
period
they
formed
squatter
governments
and
land
associations
comparable
to
the
action
of
the
massachusetts
men
who
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
seventeenth
century
squatted
in
the
connecticut
valley
a
great
forward
movement
had
occurred
which
took
possession
of
oak
openings
and
prairies
gave
birth
to
the
cities
of
chicago
milwaukee
paul
and
minneapolis
as
well
as
to
a
multitude
of
lesser
cities
and
replaced
the
dominance
of
the
southern
element
by
that
of
a
modified
puritan
stock
the
railroad
system
of
the
early
fifties
bound
the
mississippi
to
the
north
atlantic
seaboard
new
orleans
gave
way
to
new
york
as
the
outlet
for
the
middle
west
and
the
day
of
river
settlement
was
succeeded
by
the
era
of
settlement
and
railway
transportation
the
change
in
the
political
and
social
ideals
was
at
least
equal
to
the
change
in
economic
connections
and
together
these
forces
made
an
intimate
organic
union
between
new
england
new
york
and
the
newly
settled
west
in
estimating
the
new
england
influence
in
the
middle
west
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
new
york
settlers
were
mainly
new
englanders
of
a
later
generation
combined
with
the
streams
from
the
east
came
the
german
migration
into
the
middle
west
over
half
a
million
mainly
from
the
palatinate
würtemberg
and
the
adjacent
regions
sought
america
between
and
and
nearly
a
million
more
germans
came
in
the
next
decade
the
larger
portion
of
these
went
into
the
middle
west
they
became
pioneers
in
the
newer
parts
of
ohio
especially
along
the
central
ridge
and
in
cincinnati
they
took
up
the
hardwood
lands
of
the
wisconsin
counties
along
lake
michigan
and
they
came
in
important
numbers
to
missouri
illinois
indiana
and
michigan
and
to
the
river
towns
of
iowa
the
migration
in
the
thirties
and
forties
contained
an
exceptionally
large
proportion
of
educated
and
forceful
leaders
men
who
had
struggled
in
vain
for
the
ideal
of
a
liberal
german
nation
and
who
contributed
important
intellectual
forces
to
the
communities
in
which
they
settled
the
germans
as
a
whole
furnished
a
conservative
and
thrifty
agricultural
element
to
the
middle
west
in
some
of
their
social
ideals
they
came
into
collision
with
the
puritan
element
from
new
england
and
the
outcome
of
the
steady
contest
has
been
a
compromise
of
all
the
states
wisconsin
has
been
most
deeply
influenced
by
the
germans
by
the
later
fifties
therefore
the
control
of
the
middle
west
had
passed
to
its
northern
zone
of
population
and
this
zone
included
representatives
of
the
middle
states
new
england
and
germany
as
its
principal
elements
the
southern
people
north
of
the
ohio
differed
in
important
respects
from
the
southerners
across
the
river
they
had
sprung
largely
from
the
humbler
classes
of
the
south
although
there
were
important
exceptions
the
early
pioneer
life
however
was
to
the
great
plantations
and
slavery
was
excluded
under
the
ordinance
thus
this
southern
zone
of
the
middle
west
particularly
in
indiana
and
illinois
constituted
a
mediating
section
between
the
south
and
the
north
the
mississippi
still
acted
as
a
bond
of
union
and
up
to
the
close
of
the
war
of
the
valley
north
and
south
had
been
fundamentally
of
the
same
social
organization
in
order
to
understand
what
follows
we
must
bear
in
mind
the
outlines
of
the
occupation
of
the
gulf
plains
while
settlement
had
been
crossing
the
ohio
to
the
northwest
the
spread
of
cotton
culture
and
negro
slavery
into
the
southwest
had
been
equally
significant
what
the
new
england
states
and
new
york
were
in
the
occupation
of
the
middle
west
virginia
the
carolinas
and
georgia
were
in
the
occupation
of
the
gulf
states
but
as
in
the
case
of
the
northwest
a
modification
of
the
original
stock
occurred
in
the
new
environment
a
greater
energy
and
initiative
appeared
in
the
new
southern
lands
the
pioneer
devotion
to
exploiting
the
territory
in
which
he
was
placed
transferred
slavery
from
the
patriarchal
to
the
commercial
basis
the
same
expansive
tendency
seen
in
the
northwest
revealed
itself
with
a
belligerent
seasoning
in
the
gulf
states
they
had
a
program
of
action
abraham
lincoln
migrated
from
kentucky
to
indiana
and
to
illinois
jefferson
davis
moved
from
kentucky
to
louisiana
and
thence
to
mississippi
in
the
same
period
starting
from
the
same
locality
each
represented
the
divergent
flow
of
streams
of
settlement
into
contrasted
environments
the
result
of
these
antagonistic
streams
of
migration
to
the
west
was
a
struggle
between
the
lake
and
prairie
plainsmen
on
the
one
side
and
the
gulf
plainsmen
on
the
other
for
the
possession
of
the
mississippi
valley
it
was
the
crucial
part
of
the
struggle
between
the
northern
and
southern
sections
of
the
nation
what
gave
slavery
and
state
sovereignty
their
power
as
issues
was
the
fact
that
they
involved
the
question
of
dominance
over
common
territory
in
an
expanding
nation
the
place
of
the
middle
west
in
the
origin
and
settlement
of
the
great
slavery
struggle
is
of
the
highest
significance
in
the
early
history
of
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
a
modified
form
of
slavery
existed
under
a
system
of
indenture
of
the
colored
servant
and
the
effort
of
southern
settlers
in
indiana
and
in
illinois
to
reintroduce
slavery
are
indicative
of
the
importance
of
the
element
in
the
northwest
but
the
most
significant
early
manifestation
of
the
rival
currents
of
migration
with
respect
to
slavery
is
seen
in
the
contest
which
culminated
in
the
missouri
compromise
the
historical
obstacle
of
the
ordinance
as
well
as
natural
conditions
gave
an
advantage
to
the
settlers
northwest
of
the
ohio
but
when
the
mississippi
was
crossed
and
the
rival
streams
of
settlement
mingled
in
the
area
of
the
louisiana
purchase
the
struggle
followed
it
was
an
illinois
man
with
constituents
in
both
currents
of
settlement
who
introduced
the
missouri
compromise
which
made
a
for
the
middle
west
until
the
compromise
of
gave
to
senator
douglas
of
illinois
in
the
opportunity
to
reopen
the
issue
by
his
bill
in
his
doctrine
of
or
the
right
of
the
territories
to
determine
the
question
of
slavery
within
their
bounds
douglas
utilized
a
favorite
western
political
idea
one
which
cass
of
michigan
had
promulgated
before
douglas
set
the
love
of
the
middle
west
for
local
against
its
preponderant
antipathy
to
the
spread
of
slavery
at
the
same
time
he
brought
to
the
support
of
the
doctrine
the
democratic
party
which
ever
since
the
days
of
andrew
jackson
had
voiced
the
love
of
the
frontier
for
individualism
and
for
popular
power
in
his
young
america
doctrines
douglas
had
also
made
himself
the
spokesman
of
western
expansive
tendencies
he
thus
found
important
sources
of
popular
support
when
he
invoked
the
localism
of
his
section
western
appeals
to
congress
for
aid
in
internal
improvements
protective
tariffs
and
land
grants
had
been
indications
of
nationalism
the
doctrine
of
itself
catered
to
the
love
of
national
union
by
presenting
the
appearance
of
a
compromise
which
should
allow
the
new
areas
of
the
middle
west
to
determine
their
own
institutions
but
the
free
soil
party
strongest
in
the
regions
occupied
by
the
new
england
colonists
and
having
for
its
program
national
prohibition
of
the
spread
of
slavery
into
the
territories
had
already
found
in
the
middle
west
an
important
center
of
power
the
strength
of
the
movement
far
surpassed
the
actual
voting
power
of
the
free
soil
party
for
it
compelled
both
whigs
and
democrats
to
propose
fusion
on
the
basis
of
concession
to
free
soil
doctrines
the
new
england
settlers
and
the
western
new
york
settlers
the
children
of
new
england
were
keenly
alive
to
the
importance
of
the
issue
indeed
seward
in
an
address
at
madison
wisconsin
in
declared
that
the
northwest
in
reality
extended
to
the
base
of
the
alleghanies
and
that
the
new
states
had
matured
just
in
the
critical
moment
to
rally
the
free
states
of
the
atlantic
coast
to
call
them
back
to
their
ancient
principles
these
free
soil
forces
and
the
nationalistic
tendencies
of
the
middle
west
proved
too
strong
for
the
opposing
doctrines
when
the
real
struggle
came
calhoun
and
taney
shaped
the
issue
so
logically
that
the
middle
west
saw
that
the
contest
was
not
only
a
war
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
but
also
a
war
for
the
possession
of
the
unoccupied
west
a
struggle
between
the
middle
west
and
the
states
of
the
gulf
plains
the
economic
life
of
the
middle
west
had
been

it
in

hostile

in

they
have
no

to

massachusetts

south

might
for
aught
i
know
find
a

that
would
be
mutually
satisfactory
to
them
but
sir
they
can
find
no
such
line
to
which
the
western
country
can
assent
but
it
was
abraham
lincoln
who
stated
the
issue
with
the
greatest
precision
and
who
voiced
most
clearly
the
nationalism
of
the
middle
west
when
he
declared
a
house
divided
against
itself
can
not
stand
i
believe
this
government
can
not
endure
permanently
half
slave
and
half
free
so
it
was
that
when
the
civil
war
in
kansas
grew
into
the
civil
war
in
the

after
lincoln
election
to
the

the
middle
west
dominated
by
its
combined
puritan
and
german
population
ceased
to
compromise
and
turned
the
scale
in
favor
of
the
north
the
middle
west
furnished
more
than
of
the

troops
the
names
of
grant
and
sherman
are
sufficient
testimony
to
her
leadership
in
the
field
the
names
of
lincoln
and
chase
show
that
the
presidential
the
financial
and
the
war
powers
were
in
the
hands
of
the
middle
west
if
we
were
to
accept
seward
own
classification
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
as
well
belonged
to
the
same
section
it
was
at
least
in
the
hands
of
representatives
of
the
dominant
forces
of
the
section
the
middle
west
led
by
grant
and
sherman
hewed
its
way
down
the
mississippi
and
across
the
gulf
states
and
lincoln
could
exult
in
the
father
of
waters
again
goes
unvexed
to
the
sea
thanks
to
the
great
northwest
for
it
nor
yet
wholly
to
them
in
thus
outlining
the
relations
of
the
middle
west
to
the
slavery
struggle
we
have
passed
over
important
extensions
of
settlement
in
the
decade
before
the

in
these
years
not
only
did
the
density
of

increase
in
the

but
new

the
pine

had
been
the
field
of
operations
of
indian

at
first
under

companies
and
afterward
under

the
traders
with

skirted
the

and
followed
the
rivers
into
the
forests
where
they
stationed
their
posts
and
spread
goods
and
whiskey
among
the

their
posts
were
centers
of
disintegration
among

the

the

with
an
influence

for
the
procession
of

that
crossed
the

the

the
outcome

the

it
began
to
operate
most
actively
contemporaneously
with
the
development
of

to
the

in
the
two
decades
from

in

outcome
was
an
extension

by

out
to

to
fill
the

what
these
statistics
of
settlement
mean
when
translated
into
the
pioneer
life
of
the
prairie
can
not
be
told
here
there
were
sharp
contrasts
with
the
pioneer
life
of
the
old
northwest
for
the
forest
shade
there
was
substituted
the
boundless
prairie
the
sod
house
for
the
log
hut
the
continental
railway
for
the
old
national
turnpike
and
the
erie
canal
life
moved
faster
in
larger
masses
and
with
greater
momentum
in
this
pioneer
movement
the
horizon
line
was
more
remote
things
were
done
in
the
gross
the
transcontinental
railroad
the
bonanza
farm
the
steam
plow
harvester
and
thresher
the
furrow
and
the
vast
cattle
ranches
all
suggested
spacious
combination
and
systematization
of
industry
the
largest
hopes
were
excited
by
these
conquests
of
the
prairie
the
occupation
of
western
kansas
may
illustrate
the
movement
which
went
on
also
in
the
west
of
nebraska
and
the
dakotas
the
pioneer
farmer
tried
to
push
into
the
region
with
the
old
methods
of
settlement
deceived
by
rainy
seasons
and
the
railroad
advertisements
and
recklessly
optimistic
hosts
of
settlers
poured
out
into
the
plains
beyond
the
region
of
sufficient
rainfall
for
successful
agriculture
without
irrigation
dry
seasons
starved
them
back
but
a
repetition
of
good
rainfalls
again
aroused
the
determination
to
occupy
the
western
plains
boom
towns
flourished
like
prairie
weeds
eastern
capital
struggled
for
a
chance
to
share
in
the
venture
and
the
kansas
farmers
eagerly
mortgaged
their
possessions
to
secure
the
capital
so
freely
offered
for
their
attack
on
the
arid
lands
by
the
tide
of
the
pioneer
farmers
had
flowed
across
the
plains
to
the
western
boundary
of
the
state
but
it
was
a
hopeless
effort
to
conquer
a
new
province
by
the
forces
that
had
won
the
prairies
the
wave
of
settlement
dashed
itself
in
vain
against
the
conditions
of
the
great
plains
the
native
american
farmer
had
received
his
first
defeat
farm
products
at
the
same
period
had
depreciated
and
he
turned
to
the
national
government
for
reinforcements
the
populistic
movement
of
the
western
half
of
the
middle
west
is
a
complex
of
many
forces
in
some
respects
it
is
the
latest
manifestation
of
the
same
forces
that
brought
on
the
crisis
of
in
the
earlier
region
of
pioneer
exploitation
that
era
of
reckless
internal
improvements
and
land
purchases
by
borrowed
capital
brought
a
reaction
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
future
had
been
but
in
that
time
there
were
the
farther
free
lands
to
which
the
ruined
pioneer
could
turn
the
demand
for
an
expansion
of
the
currency
has
marked
each
area
of
western
advance
the
greenback
movement
of
ohio
and
the
eastern
part
of
the
middle
west
grew
into
the
fiat
money
free
silver
and
land
bank
propositions
of
the
populists
across
the
mississippi
efforts
for
cheaper
transportation
also
appear
in
each
stage
of
western
advance
when
the
pioneer
left
the
rivers
and
had
to
haul
his
crops
by
wagon
to
a
market
the
transportation
factor
determined
both
his
profits
and
the
extension
of
settlement
demands
for
national
aid
to
roads
and
canals
had
marked
the
pioneer
advance
of
the
first
third
of
the
century
the
granger
attacks
upon
the
railway
rates
and
in
favor
of
governmental
regulation
marked
a
second
advance
of
western
settlement
the
farmers
alliance
and
the
populist
demand
for
government
ownership
of
the
railroad
is
a
phase
of
the
same
effort
of
the
pioneer
farmer
on
his
latest
frontier
the
proposals
have
taken
increasing
proportions
in
each
region
of
western
advance
taken
as
a
whole
populism
is
a
manifestation
of
the
old
pioneer
ideals
of
the
native
american
with
the
added
element
of
increasing
readiness
to
utilize
the
national
government
to
effect
its
ends
this
is
not
unnatural
in
a
section
whose
lands
were
originally
purchased
by
the
government
and
given
away
to
its
settlers
by
the
same
authority
whose
railroads
were
built
largely
by
federal
land
grants
and
whose
settlements
were
protected
by
the
united
states
army
and
governed
by
the
national
authority
until
they
were
carved
into
rectangular
states
and
admitted
into
the
union
its
native
settlers
were
drawn
from
many
states
many
of
them
former
soldiers
of
the
civil
war
who
mingled
in
new
lands
with
foreign
immigrants
accustomed
to
the
vigorous
authority
of
european
national
governments
but
these
old
ideals
of
the
american
pioneer
phrased
in
the
new
language
of
national
power
did
not
meet
with
the
assent
of
the
east
even
in
the
middle
west
a
change
of
deepest
import
had
been
in
progress
during
these
years
of
prairie
settlement
the
agricultural
preponderance
of
the
country
has
passed
to
the
prairies
and
manufacturing
has
developed
in
the
areas
once
devoted
to
pioneer
farming
in
the
decade
prior
to
the
civil
war
the
area
of
greatest
wheat
production
passed
from
ohio
and
the
states
to
the
east
into
illinois
indiana
and
wisconsin
after
the
center
of
wheat
growing
moved
across
the
mississippi
and
in
the
new
settlements
produced
half
the
crop
of
the
united
states
the
corn
area
shows
a
similar
migration
in
the
southern
states
produced
half
the
crop
and
the
middle
west
by
the
situation
was
reversed
and
in
nearly
the
corn
of
the
union
came
from
beyond
the
mississippi
thus
the
settlers
of
the
old
northwest
and
their
crops
have
moved
together
across
the
mississippi
and
in
the
regions
whence
they
migrated
varied
agriculture
and
manufacture
have
sprung
up
as
these
movements
in
population
and
products
have
passed
across
the
middle
west
and
as
the
economic
life
of
the
eastern
border
has
been
intensified
a
huge
industrial
organism
has
been
created
in
the
province
an
organism
of
tremendous
power
activity
and
unity
fundamentally
the
middle
west
is
an
agricultural
area
unequaled
for
its
combination
of
space
variety
productiveness
and
freedom
from
interruption
by
deserts
or
mountains
the
huge
water
system
of
the
great
lakes
has
become
the
highway
of
a
mighty
commerce
the
sault
ste
marie
canal
although
open
but
of
the
year
is
the
channel
of
a
traffic
of
greater
tonnage
than
that
which
passes
through
the
suez
canal
and
nearly
all
this
commerce
moves
almost
the
whole
length
of
the
great
lakes
system
the
chief
ports
being
duluth
chicago
detroit
cleveland
and
buffalo
the
transportation
facilities
of
the
great

were
revolutionized
after
to
supply
the
needs
of
commerce
between
the
east
and
the
newly
developed
lands
of
the

the

doubled
wooden

to

sailing
vessels
yielded
to
steam
and
huge
docks

triumphs
of
mechanical
skill
were
constructed
a

has
lately
declared
that
there
is
probably

can
be
laid
down
for

than
they
can
be
manufactured
or
purchased
at

this
rapid
rise
of
the

of
our
inland

has
led
to
the
demand
for
deep

canals
to
connect

road
to

when
the
fleets
of
the

plow
the

become

the

transportation
of
the
middle

will
have
completed
its
evolution
the
significance
of
the
development
of
the
railway
systems
is
not
inferior
to
that
of
the
great

chicago
has
become
the
greatest
railroad
center
of
the
world
nor
is
there
another
area
of
like
size
which
equals
this
in
its
railroad
facilities
all
the
forces
of
the
nation
intersect
here
improved
terminals
steel
rails
better
rolling

and
consolidation
of
railway
systems
have
accompanied
the
advance
of
the
people
of
the
middle
west
this
unparalleled
development
of
transportation
facilities
measures
the
magnitude
of
the
material
development
of
the
province
its
wheat
and
corn
surplus
supplies
the
deficit
of
the
rest
of
the
united
states
and
much
of
that
of
europe
such
is
the
agricultural
condition
of
the
province
of
which
monroe
wrote
to
jefferson
in
in
these
words
a
great
part
of
the
territory
is
miserably
poor
especially
that
near

michigan
and
erie
and
that
upon
the
mississippi
and
the
illinois
consists
of
extensive
plains
which
have
not
had
from
appearances
and
will
not
have
a
single
bush
on
them
for
ages
the
districts
therefore
within
which
these
fall
will
never
contain
a
sufficient
number
of
inhabitants
to
entitle
them
to
membership
in
the

minneapolis
and
duluth
receive
the
spring
wheat
of
the
northern
prairies
and
after
manufacturing
great
portions
of
it
into
flour
transmit
it
to
buffalo
the
eastern
cities
and
to
europe
chicago
is
still
the
great
city
of
the
corn
belt
but
its
power
as
a
milling
and
wheat
center
has
been
passing
to
the
cities
that
receive
tribute
from
the
northern
prairies
it
lies
in
the
region
of
winter
wheat
corn
oats
and
live
stock
kansas
city
louis
and
cincinnati
are
the
sister
cities
of
this
zone
which
reaches
into
the
grazing
country
of
the
great
plains
the
meeting
point
of
corn
and
cattle
has
led
to
the
development
of
the
packing
industries
large
business
systems
that
send
the
beef
and
pork
of
the
region
to
supply
the
east
and
parts
of
europe
the
feeding
system
adopted
in
kansas
nebraska
and
iowa
whereby
the
stock
is
fattened
from
the
surplus
corn
of
the
region
constitutes
a
species
of
varied
farming
that
has
saved
these
states
from
the
disasters
of
the
failure
of
a
single
industry
and
has
been
one
solution
of
the
economic
life
of
the
transition
belt
between
the
prairies
and
the
great
plains
under
a
more
complex
agriculture
better
adapted
to
the
various
sections
of
the
state
and
with
better
crops
kansas
has
become
more
prosperous
and
less
a
center
of
political
discontent
while
this
development
of
the
agricultural
interests
of
the
middle
west
has
been
in
progress
the
exploitation
of
the
pine
woods
of
the
north
has
furnished
another
contribution
to
the
commerce
of
the
province
the
center
of
activity
has
migrated
from
michigan
to
minnesota
and
the
lumber
traffic
furnishes
one
of
the
principal
contributions
to
the
vessels
that
ply
the
great
lakes
and
supply
the
tributary
mills
as
the
white
pine
vanishes
before
the
organized
forces
of
exploitation
the
remaining
hard
woods
serve
to
establish
factories
in
the
former
mill
towns
the
more
fertile
denuded
lands
of
the
north
are
now
receiving
settlers
who
repeat
the
old
pioneer
life
among
the
stumps
but
the
most
striking
development
in
the
industrial
history
of
the
middle
west
in
recent
years
has
been
due
to
the
opening
up
of
the
iron
mines
of
lake
superior
even
in
the
lake
superior
ores
furnished
a
quarter
of
the
total
production
of
american
blast
furnaces
the
opening
of
the
gogebic
mines
in
and
the
development
of
the
vermillion
and
mesabi
mines
adjacent
to
the
head
of
the
lake
in
the
early
nineties
completed
the
transfer
of
iron
ore
production
to
the
lake
superior
region
michigan
minnesota
and
wisconsin
together
now
produce
the
ore
for
eighty
per
cent
of
the
pig
iron
of
the
united
states
of
this
great
product
moves
to
the
ports
on
lake
erie
and
the
rest
to
the
manufactories
at
chicago
and
milwaukee
the
vast
steel
and
iron
industry
that
centers
at
pittsburgh
and
cleveland
with
important
outposts
like
chicago
and
milwaukee
is
the
outcome
of
the
meeting
of
the
coal
of
the
eastern
and
southern
borders
of
the
province
and
of
pennsylvania
with
the
iron
ores
of
the
north
the
industry
has
been
systematized
and
consolidated
by
a
few
captains
of
industry
steam
shovels
dig
the
ore
from
many
of
the
mesabi
mines
gravity
roads
carry
it
to
the
docks
and
to
the
ships
and
huge
hoisting
and
carrying
devices
built
especially
for
the

unload
it
for
the
railroad
and
the

iron

coal
mines
transportation
fleets
railroad
systems
and
iron
manufactories
are
concentrated
in
a
few
corporations
principally
the
united
states
steel
corporation
the
world
has
never
seen
such
a
consolidation
of
capital
and
so
complete
a
systematization
of
economic
processes
such
is
the
economic
appearance
of
the
middle
west
a
century
after
the
pioneers
left
the
frontier
village
of
pittsburgh
and
crossed
the
ohio
into
the
forests
de
tocqueville
exclaimed
with
reason
in
this
gradual
and
continuous
progress
of
the
european
race
toward
the
rocky
mountains
has
the
solemnity
of
a
providential
event
it
is
like
a
deluge
of
men
rising
unabatedly
and
driven
daily
onward
by
the
hand
of
god
the
ideals
of
the
middle
west
began
in
the
log
huts
set
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
a
century
ago
while
his
horizon
was
still
bounded
by
the
clearing
that
his
ax
had
made
the
pioneer
dreamed
of
continental
conquests
the
vastness
of
the
wilderness
kindled
his
imagination
his
vision
saw
beyond
the
dank
swamp
at
the
edge
of
the
great
lake
to
the
lofty
buildings
and
the
jostling
multitudes
of
a
mighty
city
beyond
the
rank
prairie
to
the
seas
of
golden
grain
beyond
the
harsh
life
of
the
log
hut
and
the
sod
house
to
the
home
of
his
children
where
should
dwell
comfort
and
the
higher
things
of
life
though
they
might
not
be
for
him
the
men
and
women
who
made
the
middle
west
were
idealists
and
they
had
the
power
of
will
to
make
their
dreams
come
true
here
also
were
the
pioneer
traits
individual
activity
inventiveness
and
competition
for
the
prizes
of
the
rich
province
that
awaited
exploitation
under
freedom
and
equality
of
opportunity
he
honored
the
man
whose
eye
was
the
quickest
and
whose
grasp
was
the
strongest
in
this
contest
it
was
every
one
for
himself
the
early
society
of
the
middle
west
was
not
a
complex
highly
differentiated
and
organized
society
almost
every
family
was
a
unit
and
liberty
and
equality
flourished
in
the
frontier
periods
of
the
middle
west
as
perhaps
never
before
in
history
american
democracy
came
from
the
forest
and
its
destiny
drove
it
to
material
conquests
but
the
materialism
of
the
pioneer
was
not
the
dull
contented
materialism
of
an
old
and
fixed
society
both
native
settler
and
european
immigrant
saw
in
this
free
and
competitive
movement
of
the
frontier
the
chance
to
break
the
bondage
of
social
rank
and
to
rise
to
a
higher
plane
of
existence
the
pioneer
was
passionately
desirous
to
secure
for
himself
and
for
his
family
a
favorable
place
in
the
midst
of
these
large
and
free
but
vanishing
opportunities
it
took
a
century
for
this
society
to
fit
itself
into
the
conditions
of
the
whole
province
little
by
little
nature
pressed
into
her
mold
the
plastic
pioneer
life
the
middle
west
yesterday
a
pioneer
province
is
the
field
of
industrial
resources
and
systematization
so
vast
that
europe
alarmed
for
her
industries
in
competition
with
this
new
power
is
discussing
the
policy
of
forming
protective
alliances
among
the
nations
of
the
continent
into
this
region
flowed
the
great
forces
of
modern
capitalism
indeed
the
region
itself
furnished
favorable
conditions
for
the
creation
of
these
forces
and
trained
many
of
the
famous
american
industrial
leaders
the
prairies
the
great
plains
and
the
great
lakes
furnished
new
standards
of
industrial
measurement
from
this
society
seated
amidst
a
wealth
of
material
advantages
and
breeding
individualism
energetic
competition
inventiveness
and
spaciousness
of
design
came
the
triumph
of
the
strongest
the
captains
of
industry
arose
and
seized
on
nature
gifts
struggling
with
one
another
increasing
the
scope
of
their
ambitions
as
the
largeness
of
the
resources
and
the
extent
of
the
fields
of
activity
revealed
themselves
they
were
forced
to
accept
the
natural
conditions
of
a
province
vast
in
area
but
simple
in
structure
competition
grew
into
consolidation
on
the
pittsburgh
border
of
the
middle
west
the
completion
of
the
process
is
most
clearly
seen
on
the
prairies
of
kansas
stands
the
populist
a
survival
of
the
pioneer
striving
to
adjust
present
conditions
to
his
old
ideals
the
ideals
of
equality
freedom
of
opportunity
faith
in
the
common
man
are
deep
rooted
in
all
the
middle
west
the
frontier
stage
through
which
each
portion
passed
left
abiding
traces
on
the
older
as
well
as
on
the
newer
areas
of
the
province
nor
were
these
ideals
limited
to
the
native
american
settlers
germans
and
scandinavians
who
poured
into
the
middle
west
sought
the
country
with
like
hopes
and
like
faith
these
facts
must
be
remembered
in
estimating
the
effects
of
the
economic
transformation
of
the
province
upon
its
democracy
the
peculiar
democracy
of
the
frontier
has
passed
away
with
the
conditions
that
produced
it
but
the
democratic
aspirations
remain
they
are
held
with
passionate
determination
the
task
of
the
middle
west
is
that
of
adapting
democracy
to
the
vast
economic
organization
of
the
present
this
region
which
has
so
often
needed
the
reminder
that
bigness
is
not
greatness
may
yet
show
that
its
training
has
produced
the
power
to
reconcile
popular
government
and
culture
with
the
huge
industrial
society
of
the
modern
world
the
democracies
of
the
past
have
been
small
communities
under
simple
and
primitive
economic
conditions
at
bottom
the
problem
is
how
to
reconcile
real
greatness
with
bigness
it
is
important
that
the
middle
west
should
accomplish
this
the
future
of
the
republic
is
with
her
politically
she
is
dominant
as
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
six
out
of
seven
of
the
presidents
elected
since
have
come
from
her
borders
million
people
live
in
the
middle
west
as
against
million
in
new
england
and
the
middle
states
together
and
the
middle
west
has
indefinite
capacity
for
growth
the
educational
forces
are
more
democratic
than
in
the
east
and
the
middle
west
has
twice
as
many
students
if
we
count
together
the
common
school
secondary
and
collegiate
attendance
as
have
new
england
and
the
middle
states
combined
nor
is
this
educational
system
as
a
whole
inferior
to
that
of
the
eastern
states
state
universities
crown
the
public
school
system
in
every
one
of
these
states
of
the
middle
west
and
rank
with
the
universities
of
the
seaboard
while
private
munificence
has
furnished
others
on
an
unexampled
scale
the
public
and
private
art
collections
of
pittsburgh
chicago
paul
and
other
cities
rival
those
of
the
seaboard
world
fairs
with
their
important
popular
educational
influences
have
been
held
at
chicago
omaha
and
buffalo
and
the
next
of
these
national
gatherings
is
to
be
at
louis
there
is
throughout
the
middle
west
a
vigor
and
a
mental
activity
among
the
common
people
that
bode
well
for
its
future
if
the
task
of
reducing
the
province
of
the
lake
and
prairie
plains
to
the
uses
of
civilization
should
for
a
time
overweigh
art
and
literature
and
even
high
political
and
social
ideals
it
would
not
be
surprising
but
if
the
ideals
of
the
pioneers
shall
survive
the
inundation
of
material
success
we
may
expect
to
see
in
the
middle
west
the
rise
of
a
highly
intelligent
society
where
culture
shall
be
reconciled
with
democracy

the

in
american
history
in
a
notable
essay
professor
josiah
royce
has
asserted
the
salutary
influence
of
a
highly
organized
provincial
life
in
order
to
counteract
certain
evils
arising
from
the
tremendous
development
of
nationalism
in
our
own
day
among
these
evils
he
enumerates
first
the
frequent
changes
of
dwelling
place
whereby
the
community
is
in
danger
of
losing
the
organization
of
a
common
life
second
the
tendency
to
reduce
variety
in
national
civilization
to
assimilate
all
to
a
common
type
and
thus
to
discourage
individuality
and
produce
a
remorseless
mechanism
vast
irrational
third
the
evils
arising
from
the
fact
that
waves
of
emotion
the
passion
of
the
mob
tend
in
our
day
to
sweep
across
the
nation
against
these
surges
of
national
feeling
professor
royce
would
erect
dikes
in
the
form
of
provincialism
the
resistance
of
separate
sections
each
with
its
own
traditions
beliefs
and
aspirations
our
national
unities
have
grown
so
vast
our
forces
of
social
consolidation
so
paramount
the
resulting
problems
conflicts
evils
have
become
so
intensified
he
says
that
we
must
seek
in
the
province
renewed
strength
usefulness
and
beauty
of
american
life
whatever
may
be
thought
of
this
philosopher
appeal
for
a
revival
of
sectionalism
on
a
higher
level
in
order
to
check
the
tendencies
to
a
deadening
uniformity
of
national
consolidation
and
to
me
this
appeal
under
the
limitations
which
he
gives
it
seems
warranted
by
the
conditions
it
is
certainly
true
that
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
sectionalism
holds
a
place
too
little
recognized
by
the
historians
by
sectionalism
i
do
not
mean
the
struggle
between
north
and
south
which
culminated
in
the
civil
war
that
extreme
and
tragic
form
of
sectionalism
indeed
has
almost
engrossed
the
attention
of
historians
and
it
is
no
doubt
the
most
striking
and
painful
example
of
the
phenomenon
in
our
history
but
there
are
older
and
perhaps
in
the
long
run
more
enduring
examples
of
the
play
of
sectional
forces
than
the
slavery
struggle
and
there
are
various
sections
besides
north
and
south
indeed
the
united
states
is
in
size
and
natural
resources
an
empire
a
collection
of
potential
nations
rather
than
a
single
nation
it
is
comparable
in
area
to
europe
if
the
coast
of
california
be
placed
along
the
coast
of
spain
charleston
south
carolina
would
fall
near
constantinople
the
northern
shores
of
lake
superior
would
touch
the
baltic
and
new

would
lie
in
southern
italy
within
this
vast
empire
there
are
geographic
provinces
separate
in
physical
conditions
into
which
american
colonization
has
flowed
and
in
each
of
which
a
special
society
has
developed
with
an
economic
political
and
social
life
of
its
own
each
of
these
provinces
or
sections
has
developed
its
own
leaders
who
in
the
public
life
of
the
nation
have
voiced
the
needs
of
their
section
contended
with
the
representatives
of
other
sections
and
arranged
compromises
between
sections
in
national
legislation
and
policy
almost
as
ambassadors
from
separate
countries
in
a
european
congress
might
make
treaties
between
these
sections
commercial
relations
have
sprung
up
and
economic
combinations
and
contests
may
be
traced
by
the
student
who
looks
beneath
the
surface
of
our
national
life
to
the
actual
grouping
of
states
in
congressional
votes
on
tariff
internal
improvement
currency
and
banking
and
all
the
varied
legislation
in
the
field
of
commerce
american
industrial
life
is
the
outcome
of
the
combinations
and
contests
of
groups
of
states
in
sections
and
the
intellectual
the
spiritual
life
of
the
nation
is
the
result
of
the
interplay
of
the
sectional
ideals
fundamental
assumptions
and
emotions
in
short
the
real
federal
aspect
of
the
nation
if
we
penetrate
beneath
constitutional
forms
to
the
deeper
currents
of
social
economic
and
political
life
will
be
found
to
lie
in
the
relation
of
sections
and
nation
rather
than
in
the
relation
of
states
and
nation
recently
root
emphasized
the
danger
that
the
states
by
neglecting
to
fulfil
their
duties
might
fall
into
decay
while
the
national
government
engrossed
their
former
power
but
even
if
the
states
disappeared
altogether
as
effective
factors
in
our
national
life
the
sections
might
in
my
opinion
gain
from
that
very
disappearance
a
strength
and
activity
that
would
prove
effective
limitations
upon
the
nationalizing
process
without
pursuing
the
interesting
speculation
i
may
note
as
evidence
of
the
development
of
sectionalism
the
various
gatherings
of
business
men
religious
denominations
and
educational
organizations
in
groups
of
states
among
the
signs
of
growth
of
a
healthy
provincialism
is
the
formation
of
sectional
historical
societies
while
the
american
historical
association
has
been
growing
vigorously
and
becoming
a
genuine
gathering
of
historical
students
from
all
parts
of
the
nation
there
have
also
arisen
societies
in
various
sections
to
deal
with
the
particular
history
of
the
groups
of
states
in
part
this
is
due
to
the
great
distances
which
render
attendance
difficult
upon
the
meetings
of
the
national
body
but
we
would
be
indeed
who
failed
to
perceive
in
the
formation
of
the
pacific
coast
historical
association
the
mississippi
valley
historical
association
and
the
ohio
valley
historical
association
for
example
genuine
and
spontaneous
manifestations
of
a
sectional
consciousness
these
associations
spring
in
large
part
from
the
recognition
in
each
of
a
common
past
a
common
body
of
experiences
traditions
institutions
and
ideals
it
is
not
necessary
now
to
raise
the
question
whether
all
of
these
associations
are
based
on
a
real
community
of
historical
interest
whether
there
are
overlapping
areas
whether
new
combinations
may
not
be
made
they
are
at
least
substantial
attempts
to
find
a
common
sectional
unity
and
out
of
their
interest
in
the
past
of
the
section
increasing
tendencies
to
common
sectional
ideas
and
policies
are
certain
to
follow
i
do
not
mean
to
prophesy
any
disruptive
tendency
in
american
life
by
the
rejuvenation
of
sectional
but
i
do
mean
to
assert
that
american
life
will
be
enriched
and
by
the
development
of
the
greater
variety
of
interest
purposes
and
ideals
which
seem
to
be
arising
a
measure
of
local
concentration
seems
necessary
to
produce
healthy
intellectual
and
moral
life
the
spread
of
social
forces
over
too
vast
an
area
makes
for
monotony
and
stagnation
let
us
then
raise
the
question
of
how
far
the
ohio
valley
has
had
a
part
of
its
own
in
the
making
of
the
nation
i
have
not
the
temerity
to
attempt
a
history
of
the
valley
in
the
brief
compass
of
this
address
nor
am
i
confident
of
my
ability
even
to
pick
out
the
more
important
features
of
its
history
in
our
common
national
life
but
i
venture
to
put
the
problem
to
state
some
familiar
facts
from
the
special
point
of
view
with
the
hope
of
arousing
interest
in
the
theme
among
the
many
students
who
are
advancing
the
science
of
history
in
this
section
to
the
physiographer
the
section
is
made
up
of
the
province
of
the
alleghany
plateaus
and
the
southern
portion
of
the
prairie
plains
in
it
are
found
rich
mineral
deposits
which
are
changing
the
life
of
the
section
and
of
the
nation
although
you
reckon
in
your
membership
only
the
states
that
touch
the
ohio
river
parts
of
those
states
are
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
social
origins
more
closely
connected
with
the
northwest
on
the
lake
plains
than
with
the
ohio
valley
and
on
the
other
hand
the
tennessee
valley
though
it
sweeps
far
toward
the
lower
south
and
only
joins
the
ohio
at
the
end
of
its
course
has
been
through
much
of
the
history
of
the
region
an
essential
part
of
this
society
together
these
rivers
made
up
the
western
world
of
the
pioneers
of
the
revolutionary
era
the
western
waters
of
the
backwoodsmen
but
after
all
the
unity
of
the
section
and
its
place
in
history
were
determined
by
the
beautiful
river
as
the
french
explorers
called
it
the
ohio
which
pours
its
flood
for
over
a
thousand
miles
a
great
highway
to
the
west
a
historic
artery
of
commerce
a
wedge
of
advance
between
powerful
indian
confederacies
and
rival
european
nations
to
the
mississippi
valley
a
home
for
six
mighty
states
now
in
the
heart
of
the
nation
rich
in
material
wealth
richer
in
the
history
of
american
democracy
a
society
that
holds
a
place
midway
between
the
industrial
sections
of
the
seaboard
and
the
plains
and
prairies
of
the
agricultural
west
between
the
society
that
formed
later
along
the
levels
about
the
great
lakes
and
the
society
that
arose
in
the
lower
south
on
the
plains
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
alleghanies
bound
it
on
the
east
the
mississippi
on
the
west
at
the
forks
of
the
great
river
lies
pittsburgh
the
historic
gateway
to
the
west
the
present
symbol
and
embodiment
of
the
age
of
steel
the
type
of
modern
industrialism
near
its
western
border
is
louis
looking
toward
the
prairies
the
great
plains
and
the
rocky
mountains
the
land
into
which
the
tide
of
modern
colonization
turns
between
these
old
cities
for
whose
sites
european
nations
contended
stand
the
cities
whose
growth
preëminently
represents
the
ohio
valley
cincinnati
the
historic
queen
of
the
river
louisville
the
warder
of
the
falls
the
cities
of
the
old
national
road
columbus
indianapolis
the
cities
of
the
blue
grass
lands
which
made
kentucky
the
goal
of
the
pioneers
and
the
cities
of
that
young
commonwealth
whom
the
ohio
river
by
force
of
its
attraction
tore
away
from
an
uncongenial
control
by
the
old
dominion
and
joined
to
the
social
section
where
it
belonged
the
ohio
valley
is
therefore
not
only
a
commercial
highway
it
is
a
middle
kingdom
between
the
east
and
the
west
between
the
northern
area
which
was
occupied
by
a
greater
new
england
and
emigrants
from
northern
europe
and
the
southern
area
of
the
cotton
kingdom
as
pennsylvania
and
new
york
constituted
the
middle
region
in
our
earlier
history
between
new
england
and
the
seaboard
south
so
the
ohio
valley
became
the
middle
region
of
a
later
time
in
its
position
as
a
highway
and
a
middle
region
are
found
the
keys
to
its
place
in
american
history
from
the
beginning
the
ohio
valley
seems
to
have
been
a
highway
for
migration
and
the
home
of
a
culture
of
its
own
the
sciences
of
american
archeology
and
ethnology
are
too
new
to
enable
us
to
speak
with
confidence
upon
the
origins
and
earlier
distribution
of
the
aborigines
but
it
is
at
least
clear
that
the
ohio
river
played
an
important
part
in
the
movements
of
the
earlier
men
in
america
and
that
the
mounds
of
the
valley
indicate
a
special
type
of
development
intermediate
between
that
of
the
northern
hunter
folk
and
the
pueblo
building
races
of
the
south
this
dim
and
yet
fascinating
introduction
to
the
history
of
the
ohio
will
afford
ample
opportunity
for
later
students
of
the
relations
between
geography
and
population
to
make
contributions
to
our
history
the
french
explorers
saw
the
river
but
failed
to
grasp
its
significance
as
a
strategic
line
in
the
conquest
of
the
west
entangled
in
the
water
labyrinth
of
the
vast
interior
and
kindled
with
aspirations
to
reach
the
sea
of
the
west
their
fur
traders
and
explorers
pushed
their
way
through
the
forests
of
the
north
and
across
the
plains
of
the
south
from
river
to
lake
from
lake
to
river
until
they
met
the
mountains
of
the
west
but
while
they
were
reaching
the
upper
course
of
the
missouri
and
the
spanish
outposts
of
santa
fé
they
missed
the
opportunity
to
hold
the
ohio
valley
and
before
france
could
settle
the
valley
the
long
and
attenuated
line
of
french
posts
in
the
west
reaching
from
canada
to
louisiana
was
struck
by
the
advancing
column
of
the
american
backwoodsmen
in
the
center
by
the
way
of
the
ohio
parkman
in
whose
golden
pages
is
written
the
epic
of
the
american
wilderness
found
his
hero
in
the
wandering
frenchman
perhaps
because
he
was
a
new
englander
he
missed
a
great
opportunity
and
neglected
to
portray
the
formation
and
advance
of
the
backwood
society
which
was
finally
to
erase
the
traces
of
french
control
in
the
interior
of
north
america
it
is
not
without
significance
in
a
consideration
of
the
national
aspects
of
the
history
of
the
ohio
valley
that
the
messenger
of
english
civilization
who
summoned
the
french
to
evacuate
the
valley
and
its
approaches
and
whose
men
near
the
forks
of
the
ohio
fired
the
opening
gun
of
the
conflict
that
wrought
the
doom
of
new
france
in
america
was
george
washington
the
first
american
to
win
a
national
position
in
the
united
states
the
father
of
his
country
was
the
prophet
of
the
ohio
valley
into
this
dominion
in
the
next
scene
of
this
drama
came
the
backwoodsmen
the
men
who
began
the
formation
of
the
society
of
the
valley
i
wish
to
consider
the
effects
of
the
formation
of
this
society
upon
the
nation
and
first
let
us
consider
the
stock
itself
the
ohio
valley
was
settled
for
the
most
part
though
with
important
exceptions
especially
in
ohio
by
men
of
the
upland
south
and
this
determined
a
large
part
of
its
influence
in
the
nation
through
a
long
period
as
the
ohio
valley
as
a
whole
was
an
extension
of
the
upland
south
so
the
upland
south
was
broadly
speaking
an
extension
from
the
old
middle
region
chiefly
from
pennsylvania
the
society
of
pioneers
english
germans
and
other
nationalities
which
formed
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
the
great
valley
of
pennsylvania
and
its
lateral
extensions
was
the
nursery
of
the
american
backwoodsmen
between
about
and
the
revolution
successive
tides
of
pioneers
ascended
the
shenandoah
occupied
the
piedmont
or
of
virginia
and
the
carolinas
and
received
recruits
from
similar
peoples
who
came
by
eastward
advances
from
the
coast
toward
this
old
west
thus
by
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
new
section
had
been
created
in
america
a
kind
of
peninsula
thrust
down
from
pennsylvania
between
the
falls
of
the
rivers
of
the
south
atlantic
colonies
on
the
one
side
and
the
alleghany
mountains
on
the
other
its
population
showed
a
mixture
of
nationalities
and
religions
less
english
than
the
colonial
coast
it
was
built
on
a
basis
of
religious
feeling
different
from
that
of
puritan
new
england
and
still
different
from
the
conservative
anglicans
of
the
southern
seaboard
the
presbyterians
with
the
glow
of
the
covenanters
german
sectaries
with
devotion
to
one
or
another
of
a
multiplicity
of
sects
but
withal
deeply
responsive
to
the
call
of
the
religious
spirit
and
the
english
quakers
all
furnish
a
foundation
of
emotional
responsiveness
to
religion
and
a
readiness
to
find
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
in
politics
as
well
as
in
religion
in
spite
of
the
influence
of
the
backwoods
in
hampering
religious
organization
this
upland
society
was
a
fertile
field
for
tillage
by
such
democratic
and
emotional
sects
as
the
baptists
methodists
and
the
later
campbellites
as
well
as
by
presbyterians
bryce
has
well
characterized
the
south
as
a
region
of
high
religious
voltage
but
this
characterization
is
especially
applicable
to
the
upland
south
and
its
colonies
in
the
ohio
valley
it
is
not
necessary
to
assert
that
this
religious
spirit
resulted
in
the
kind
of
conduct
associated
with
the
religious
life
of
the
puritans
what
i
wish
to
point
out
is
the
responsiveness
of
the
upland
south
to
emotional
religious
and
political
appeal
besides
its
variety
of
stocks
and
its
religious
sects
responsive
to
emotion
the
upland
south
was
intensely
democratic
and
individualistic
it
believed
that
government
was
based
on
a
limited
contract
for
the
benefit
of
the
individual
and
it
acted
independently
of
governmental
organs
and
restraints
with
such
ease
that
in
many
regions
this
was
the
habitual
mode
of
social
procedure
voluntary
coöperation
was
more
natural
to
the
southern
uplanders
than
action
through
the
machinery
of
government
especially
when
government
checked
rather
than
aided
their
industrial
and
social
tendencies
and
desires
it
was
a
naturally
radical
society
it
was
moreover
a
rural
section
not
of
the
planter
or
merchant
type
but
characterized
by
the
small
farmer
building
his
log
cabin
in
the
wilderness
raising
a
small
crop
and
a
few
animals
for
family
use
it
was
this
stock
which
began
to
pass
into
the
ohio
valley
when
daniel
boone
and
the
pioneers
associated
with
his
name
followed
the
wilderness
trace
from
the
upland
south
to
the
blue
grass
lands
in
the
midst
of
the
kentucky
hills
on
the
ohio
river
in
the
opening
years
of
the
revolution
these
pioneers
were
recruited
by
westward
extensions
from
pennsylvania
and
west
virginia
with
this
colonization
of
the
ohio
valley
begins
a
chapter
in
american
history
this
settlement
contributed
a
new
element
to
our
national
development
and
raised
new
national
problems
it
took
a
long
time
for
the
seaboard
south
to
assimilate
the
upland
section
we
can
not
think
of
the
south
as
a
unit
through
much
of
its
history
without
doing
violence
to
the
facts
the
struggle
between
the
men
of
the
and
the
men
of
the
made
a
large
part
of
the
domestic
history
of
the
old
south
nevertheless
the
upland
south
as
slavery
and
cotton
cultivation
extended
westward
from
the
coast
gradually
merged
in
the
east
on
the
other
hand
its
children
who
placed
the
wall
of
the
alleghanies
between
them
and
the
east
gave
thereby
a
new
life
to
the
conditions
and
ideals
which
were
lost
in
their
former
home
nor
was
this
all
beyond
the
mountains
new
conditions
new
problems
aroused
new
ambitions
and
new
social
ideals
its
entrance
into
the
western
world
was
a
tonic
to
this
stock
its
crossing
put
new
fire
into
its
veins
fires
of
militant
expansion
creative
social
energy
triumphant
democracy
a
new
section
was
added
to
the
american
nation
a
new
element
was
infused
into
the
combination
which
we
call
the
united
states
a
new
flavor
was
given
to
the
american
spirit
we
may
next
rapidly
note
some
of
the
results
first
let
us
consider
the
national
effects
of
the
settlement
of
this
new
social
type
in
the
ohio
valley
upon
the
expansion
and
diplomacy
of
the
nation
almost
from
the
first
the
ohio
valley
had
constituted
the
problem
of
westward
expansion
it
was
the
entering
wedge
to
the
possession
of
the
mississippi
valley
and
although
reluctantly
the
eastern
colonies
and
then
the
eastern
states
were
compelled
to
join
in
the
struggle
first
to
possess
the
ohio
then
to
retain
it
and
finally
to
enforce
its
demand
for
the
possession
of
the
whole
mississippi
valley
and
the
basin
of
the
great
lakes
as
a
means
of
outlet
for
its
crops
and
of
defense
for
its
settlements
the
part
played
by
the
pioneers
of
the
ohio
valley
as
a
flying
column
of
the
nation
sent
across
the
mountains
and
making
a
line
of
advance
between
hostile
indians
and
english
on
the
north
and
hostile
indians
and
spaniards
on
the
south
is
itself
too
extensive
a
theme
to
be
more
than
mentioned
here
in
historic
kentucky
in
the
state
which
was
the
home
of
george
rogers
clark
it
is
not
necessary
to
dwell
upon
his
clear
insight
and
courage
in
carrying
american
arms
into
the
northwest
from
the
first
washington
also
grasped
the
significance
of
the
ohio
valley
as
a
rising
empire
whose
population
and
trade
were
essential
to
the
nation
but
which
found
its
natural
outlet
down
the
mississippi
where
spain
blocked
the
river
and
which
was
in
danger
of
withdrawing
from
the
weak
confederacy
the
intrigues
of
england
to
attract
the
valley
to
herself
and
those
of
spain
to
add
the
settlements
to
the
spanish
empire
the
use
of
the
indians
by
these
rivals
and
the
efforts
of
france
to
use
the
pioneers
of
kentucky
to
win
new
orleans
and
the
whole
valley
between
the
alleghanies
and
the
rocky
mountains
for
a
revived
french
empire
in
america
are
among
the
fascinating
chapters
of
american
as
well
as
of
ohio
valley
history
this
position
of
the
valley
explains
much
of
the
indian
wars
the
foreign
relations
and
indirectly
the
domestic
politics
of
the
period
from
the
revolution
to
the
purchase
of
louisiana
indeed
the
purchase
was
in
large
measure
due
to
the
pressure
of
the
settlers
of
the
ohio
valley
to
secure
this
necessary
outlet
it
was
the
ohio
valley
which
forced
the
nation
away
from
a
narrow
colonial
attitude
into
its
career
as
a
nation
among
other
nations
with
an
adequate
physical
basis
for
future
growth
in
this
development
of
a
foreign
policy
in
connection
with
the
ohio
valley
we
find
the
germ
of
the
monroe
doctrine
and
the
beginnings
of
the
definite
independence
of
the
united
states
from
the
state
system
of
the
old
world
the
beginning
in
fact
of
its
career
as
a
world
power
this
expansive
impulse
went
on
into
the
war
of
a
war
which
was
in
no
inconsiderable
degree
the
result
of
the
aggressive
leadership
of
a
group
of
men
from
kentucky
and
tennessee
and
especially
of
the
daring
and
lofty
demands
of
henry
clay
who
even
thus
early
voiced
the
spirit
of
the
ohio
valley
that
in
this
war
william
henry
harrison
and
the
kentucky
troops
achieved
the
real
conquest
of
the
northwest
province
and
andrew
jackson
with
his
tennesseeans
achieved
the
real
conquest
of
the
gulf
plains
is
in
itself
abundant
evidence
of
the
part
played
in
the
expansion
of
the
nation
by
the
section
which
formed
on
the
ohio
and
its
tributaries
nor
was
this
the
end
of
the
process
for
the
annexation
of
texas
and
the
pacific
coast
was
in
a
very
real
sense
only
an
aftermath
of
the
same
movement
of
expansion
while
the
ohio
valley
was
leading
the
way
to
the
building
of
a
greater
nation
it
was
also
the
field
wherein
was
formed
an
important
contribution
of
the
united
states
to
political
institutions
by
this
i
mean
what
george
bancroft
has
well
called
federal
colonial
system
that
is
our
system
of
territories
and
new
states
it
is
a
mistake
to
attribute
this
system
to
the
ordinance
of
and
to
the
leadership
of
new
england
it
was
in
large
measure
the
work
of
the
communities
of
the
ohio
valley
who
wrought
out
the
essentials
of
the
system
for
themselves
and
by
their
attitude
imposed
it
of
necessity
upon
the
nation
the
great
ordinance
only
perfected
the
system
under
the
belief
that
all
men
going
into
vacant
lands
have
the
right
to
shape
their
own
political
institutions
the
riflemen
of
western
virginia
western
pennsylvania
kentucky
and
tennessee
during
the
revolution
protested
against
the
rule
of
governments
east
of
the
mountains
and
asserted
with
manly
independence
their
right
to
but
it
is
significant
that
in
making
this
assertion
they
at
the
same
time
petitioned
congress
to
admit
them
to
the
sisterhood
of
states
even
when
leaders
like
wilkinson
were
attempting
to
induce
kentucky
to
act
as
an
independent
nation
the
national
spirit
of
the
people
as
a
whole
led
them
to
delay
until
at
last
they
found
themselves
a
state
of
the
new
union
this
recognition
of
the
paramount
authority
of
congress
and
this
demand
for
under
that
authority
constitute
the
foundations
of
the
federal
territorial
system
as
expressed
in
congressional
resolutions
worked
out
tentatively
in
jefferson
ordinance
of
and
finally
shaped
in
the
ordinance
of
thus
the
ohio
valley
was
not
only
the
area
to
which
this
system
was
applied
but
it
was
itself
instrumental
in
shaping
the
system
by
its
own
demands
and
by
the
danger
that
too
rigorous
an
assertion
of
either
state
or
national
power
over
these
remote
communities
might
result
in
their
loss
to
the
nation
the
importance
of
the
result
can
hardly
be
overestimated
it
insured
the
peaceful
and
free
development
of
the
great
west
and
gave
it
political
organization
not
as
the
outcome
of
wars
of
hostile
states
nor
by
arbitrary
government
by
distant
powers
but
by
territorial
government
combined
with
large
local
autonomy
these
governments
in
turn
were
admitted
as
equal
states
of
the
union
by
this
peaceful
process
of
colonization
a
whole
continent
has
been
filled
with
free
and
orderly
commonwealths
so
quietly
so
naturally
that
we
can
only
appreciate
the
profound
significance
of
the
process
by
contrasting
it
with
the
spread
of
european
nations
through
conquest
and
oppression
next
let
me
invite
your
attention
to
the
part
played
by
the
ohio
valley
in
the
economic
legislation
which
shaped
our
history
in
the
years
of
the
making
of
the
nation
between
the
war
of
and
the
rise
of
the
slavery
struggle
it
needs
but
slight
reflection
to
discover
that
in
the
area
in
question
the
men
and
measures
of
the
ohio
valley
held
the
balance
of
power
and
set
the
course
of
our
national
progress
the
problems
before
the
country
at
that
time
were
problems
of
internal
development
the
mode
of
dealing
with
the
public
domain
the
building
of
roads
and
digging
of
canals
for
the
internal
improvement
of
a
nation
which
was
separated
into
east
and
west
by
the
alleghany
mountains
the
formation
of
a
tariff
system
for
the
protection
of
home
industries
and
to
supply
a
market
for
the
surplus
of
the
west
which
no
longer
found
an
outlet
in
warring
europe
the
framing
of
a
banking
and
currency
system
which
should
meet
the
needs
of
the
new
interstate
commerce
produced
by
the
rise
of
the
western
surplus
in
the
ohio
valley
by
the
initiative
of
ohio
valley
men
and
often
against
the
protest
of
eastern
sections
the
public
land
policy
was
developed
by
laws
which
subordinated
the
revenue
idea
to
the
idea
of
the
upbuilding
of
a
democracy
of
small
landholders
the
squatters
of
the
ohio
valley
forced
the
passage
of
preëmption
laws
and
these
laws
in
their
turn
led
to
the
homestead
agitation
there
has
been
no
single
element
more
influential
in
shaping
american
democracy
and
its
ideals
than
this
land
policy
and
whether
the
system
be
regarded
as
harmful
or
helpful
there
can
be
i
think
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
outcome
of
conditions
imposed
by
the
settlers
of
the
ohio
valley
when
one
names
the
tariff
internal
improvements
and
the
bank
he
is
bound
to
add
the
title
the
american
system
and
to
think
of
henry
clay
of
kentucky
the
captivating
young
statesman
who
fashioned
a
national
policy
raised
issues
and
disciplined
a
party
to
support
them
and
who
finally
imposed
the
system
upon
the
nation
but
however
clearly
we
recognize
the
genius
and
originality
of
henry
clay
as
a
political
leader
however
we
recognize
that
he
has
a
national
standing
as
a
constructive
statesman
we
must
perceive
if
we
probe
the
matter
deeply
enough
that
his
policy
and
his
power
grew
out
of
the
economic
and
social
conditions
of
the
people
whose
needs
he
voiced
the
people
of
the
ohio
valley
it
was
the
fact
that
in
this
period
they
had
begun
to
create
an
agricultural
surplus
which
made
the
necessity
for
this
legislation
the
nation
has
recently
celebrated
the
one
hundredth
anniversary
of
fulton
invention
of
the
steamboat
and
the
hudson
river
has
been
ablaze
in
his
honor
but
in
truth
it
is
on
the
ohio
and
the
mississippi
that
the
fires
of
celebration
should
really
burn
in
honor
of
fulton
for
the
historic
significance
to
the
united
states
of
the
invention
of
the
steamboat
does
not
lie
in
its
use
on
eastern
rivers
not
even
in
its
use
on
the
ocean
for
our
own
internal
commerce
carried
in
our
own
ships
has
had
a
vaster
influence
upon
our
national
life
than
has
our
foreign
commerce
and
this
internal
commerce
was
at
first
and
for
many
years
the
commerce
of
the
ohio
valley
carried
by
way
of
the
mississippi
when
fulton
steamboat
was
applied
in
to
the
western
waters
it
became
possible
to
develop
agriculture
and
to
get
the
western
crops
rapidly
and
cheaply
to
a
market
the
result
was
a
tremendous
growth
in
the
entire
ohio
valley
but
this
invention
did
not
solve
the
problem
of
cheap
supplies
of
eastern
manufactures
nor
satisfy
the
desire
of
the
west
to
build
up
its
own
factories
in
order
to
consume
its
own
products
the
ohio
valley
had
seen
the
advantage
of
home
markets
as
her
towns
grew
up
with
their
commerce
and
manufacturers
close
to
the
rural
regions
lands
had
increased
in
value
in
proportion
to
their
nearness
to
these
cities
and
crops
were
in
higher
demand
near
them
thus
henry
clay
found
a
whole
section
standing
behind
him
when
he
demanded
a
protective
tariff
to
create
home
markets
on
a
national
scale
and
when
he
urged
the
breaking
of
the
alleghany
barrier
by
a
national
system
of
roads
and
canals
if
we
analyse
the
congressional
votes
by
which
the
tariff
and
internal
improvement
acts
were
passed
we
shall
find
that
there
was
an
almost
unbroken
south
against
them
a
middle
region
largely
for
them
a
new
england
divided
and
the
ohio
valley
almost
a
unit
holding
the
balance
of
power
and
casting
it
in
favor
of
the
american
system
the
next
topic
to
which
i
ask
your
attention
is
the
influence
of
the
ohio
valley
in
the
promotion
of
democracy
on
this
i
shall
by
reason
of
lack
of
time
be
obliged
merely
to
point
out
that
the
powerful
group
of
ohio
valley
states
which
sprang
out
of
the
democracy
of
the
backwoods
and
which
entered
the
union
one
after
the
other
with
manhood
suffrage
greatly
recruited
the
effective
forces
of
democracy
in
the
union
not
only
did
they
add
new
recruits
but
by
their
competitive
pressure
for
population
they
forced
the
older
states
to
break
down
their
historic
restraints
upon
the
right
of
voting
unless
they
were
to
lose
their
people
to
the
freer
life
of
the
west
but
in
the
era
of
jacksonian
democracy
henry
clay
and
his
followers
engaged
the
great
tennesseean
in
a
fierce
political
struggle
out
of
which
was
born
the
rival
whig
and
democratic
parties
this
struggle
was
in
fact
reflective
of
the
conditions
which
had
arisen
in
the
ohio
valley
as
the
section
had
grown
in
population
and
wealth
as
the
trails
changed
into
roads
the
cabins
into
houses
the
clearings
into
broad
farms
the
hamlets
into
towns
as
barter
became
commerce
and
all
the
modern
processes
of
industrial
development
began
to
operate
in
this
rising
region
the
ohio
valley
broke
apart
into
the
rival
interests
of
the
industrial
forces
the
and
the
business
builders
on
the
one
side
and
the
old
rural
democracy
of
the
uplands
on
the
other
this
division
was
symbolical
of
national
processes
in
the
contest
between
these
forces
andrew
jackson
was
the
champion
of
the
cause
of
the
upland
democracy
he
denounced
the
money
power
banks
and
the
whole
credit
system
and
sounded
a
fierce
tocsin
of
danger
against
the
increasing
influence
of
wealth
in
politics
henry
clay
on
the
other
hand
represented
the
new
industrial
forces
along
the
ohio
it
is
certainly
significant
that
in
the
rivalry
between
the
great
whig
of
the
ohio
valley
and
the
great
democrat
of
its
tennessee
tributary
lay
the
issues
of
american
politics
almost
until
the
slavery
struggle
the
responsiveness
of
the
ohio
valley
to
leadership
and
its
enthusiasm
in
action
are
illustrated
by
the
harrison
campaign
of
in
that
log
cabin
campaign
when
the
whigs
stole
the
thunder
of
pioneer
jacksonian
democracy
for
another
backwoods
hero
the
ohio
valley
carried
its
spirit
as
well
as
its
political
favorite
throughout
the
nation
meanwhile
on
each
side
of
the
ohio
valley
other
sections
were
forming
new
england
and
the
children
of
new
england
in
western
new
york
and
an
increasing
flood
of
german
immigrants
were
pouring
into
the
great
lake
basin
and
the
prairies
north
of
the
upland
peoples
who
had
chopped
out
homes
in
the
forests
along
the
ohio
this
section
was
tied
to
the
east
by
the
great
lake
navigation
and
the
erie
canal
it
became
in
fact
an
extension
of
new
england
and
new
york
here
the
free
soil
party
found
its
strength
and
new
york
newspapers
expressed
the
political
ideas
although
this
section
tried
to
attach
the
ohio
river
interests
to
itself
by
canals
and
later
by
railroads
it
was
in
reality
for
a
long
time
separate
in
its
ideals
and
its
interests
and
never
succeeded
in
dominating
the
ohio
valley
on
the
south
along
the
gulf
plains
there
developed
the
cotton
kingdom
a
greater
south
with
a
radical
program
of
slavery
expansion
mapped
out
by
bold
and
aggressive
leaders
already
this
southern
section
had
attempted
to
establish
increasing
commercial
relations
with
the
ohio
valley
the
region
was
a
principal
consumer
of
its
live
stock
and
food
products
south
carolina
leaders
like
calhoun
tried
to
bind
the
ohio
to
the
chariot
of
the
south
by
the
cincinnati
and
charleston
railroad
designed
to
make
an
outlet
for
the
ohio
valley
products
to
the
southeast
georgia
in
her
turn
was
a
rival
of
south
carolina
in
plans
to
drain
this
commerce
itself
in
all
of
these
plans
to
connect
the
ohio
valley
commercially
with
the
south
the
political
object
was
quite
as
prominent
as
the
commercial
in
short
various
areas
were
bidding
for
the
support
of
the
zone
of
population
along
the
ohio
river
the
ohio
valley
recognized
its
old
relationship
to
the
south
but
its
people
were
by
no
means
champions
of
slavery
in
the
southern
portion
of
the
states
north
of
the
ohio
where
indented
servitude
for
many
years
opened
a
way
to
a
system
of
there
were
divided
counsels
kentucky
also
spoke
with
no
certain
voice
as
a
result
it
is
in
these
regions
that
we
find
the
stronghold
of
the
compromising
movement
in
the
slavery
struggle
kentucky
furnished
abraham
lincoln
to
illinois
and
jefferson
davis
to
mississippi
and
was
in
reality
the
very
center
of
the
region
of
adjustment
between
these
rival
interests
senator
thomas
of
southern
illinois
moved
the
missouri
compromise
and
henry
clay
was
the
most
effective
champion
of
that
compromise
as
he
was
the
architect
of
the
compromise
of
the
crittenden
compromise
proposals
on
the
eve
of
the
civil
war
came
also
from
kentucky
and
represent
the
persistence
of
the
spirit
of
henry
clay
in
a
word
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
beginning
the
ohio
valley
was
a
middle
region
with
a
strong
national
allegiance
striving
to
hold
apart
with
either
hand
the
sectional
combatants
in
this
struggle
in
the
cautious
development
of
his
policy
of
emancipation
we
may
see
the
profound
influence
of
the
ohio
valley
upon
abraham
lincoln
greatest
son
no
one
can
understand
his
presidency
without
proper
appreciation
of
the
deep
influence
of
the
ohio
valley
its
ideals
and
its
prejudices
upon
america
original
contribution
to
the
great
men
of
the
world
enough
has
been
said
to
make
it
clear
i
trust
that
the
ohio
valley
has
not
only
a
local
history
worthy
of
study
a
rich
heritage
to
its
people
but
also
that
it
has
been
an
independent
and
powerful
force
in
shaping
the
development
of
a
nation
of
the
late
history
of
this
valley
the
rise
of
its
vast
industrial
power
its
commercial
influence
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
speak
you
know
its
statesmen
and
their
influence
upon
our
own
time
you
know
the
relation
of
ohio
to
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states
nor
is
it
necessary
that
i
should
attempt
to
prophesy
concerning
the
future
which
the
ohio
valley
will
hold
in
the
nation
in
that
new
age
of
inland
water
transportation
which
is
certain
to
supplement
the
age
of
the
railroad
there
can
be
no
more
important
region
than
the
ohio
valley
let
us
hope
that
its
old
love
of
democracy
may
endure
and
that
in
this
section
where
the
first
pioneers
struck
blows
at
the
forests
there
may
be
brought
to
blossom
and
to
fruit
the
ripe
civilization
of
a
people
who
know
that
whatever
the
glories
of
prosperity
may
be
there
are
greater
glories
of
the
spirit
of
man
who
know
that
in
the
ultimate
record
of
history
the
place
of
the
ohio
valley
will
depend
upon
the
contribution
which
her
people
and
her
leaders
make
to
the

the
significance
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
american
history
the
rise
of
a
company
of
sympathetic
and
critical
students
of
history
in
the
south
and
in
the
west
is
bound
to
revolutionize
the
perspective
of
american
history
already
our
eastern
colleagues
are
aware
in
general
if
not
in
detail
of
the
importance
of
the
work
of
this
nation
in
dealing
with
the
vast
interior
and
with
the
influence
of
the
west
upon
the
nation
indeed
i
might
take
as
the
text
for
this
address
the
words
of
one
of
our
eastern
historians
professor
albert
bushnell
hart
who
a
decade
ago
wrote
the
mississippi
valley
yields
to
no
region
in
the
world
in
interest
in
romance
and
in
promise
for
the
future
here
if
anywhere
is
the
real
america
the
field
the
theater
and
the
basis
of
the
civilization
of
the
western
world
the
history
of
the
mississippi
valley
is
the
history
of
the
united
states
its
future
is
the
future
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
modern
nations
if
those
of
us
who
have
been
insisting
on
the
importance
of
our
own
region
are
led
at
times
by
the
enthusiasm
of
the
pioneer
for
the
inviting
historical
domain
that
opens
before
us
to
overstate
the
importance
of
our
subject
we
may
at
least
plead
that
we
have
gone
no
farther
than
some
of
our
brethren
of
the
east
and
we
may
take
comfort
in
this
declaration
of
theodore
roosevelt
the
states
that
have
grown
up
around
the
great
lakes
and
in
the
valley
of
the
upper
mississippi
are
the
states
which
are
destined
to
be
the
greatest
the
richest
the
most
prosperous
of
all
the
great
rich
and
prosperous
commonwealths
which
go
to
make
up
the
mightiest
republic
the
world
has
ever
seen
these
states
form
the
heart
of
the
country
geographically
and
they
will
soon
become
the
heart
in
population
and
in
political
and
social
importance
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
that
before
these
states
there
loomed
a
future
of
material
prosperity
merely
i
regard
this
section
of
the
country
as
the
heart
of
true
american
sentiment
in
studying
the
history
of
the
whole
mississippi
valley
therefore
the
members
of
this
association
are
studying
the
origins
of
that
portion
of
the
nation
which
is
admitted
by
competent
eastern
authorities
to
be
the
section
potentially
most
influential
in
the
future
of
america
they
are
also
studying
the
region
which
has
engaged
the
most
vital
activities
of
the
whole
nation
for
the
problems
arising
from
the
existence
of
the
mississippi
valley
whether
of
movement
of
population
diplomacy
politics
economic
development
or
social
structure
have
been
fundamental
problems
in
shaping
the
nation
it
is
not
a
narrow
not
even
a
local
interest
which
determines
the
mission
of
this
association
it
is
nothing
less
than
the
study
of
the
american
people
in
the
presence
and
under
the
influence
of
the
vast
spaces
the
imperial
resources
of
the
great
interior
the
social
destiny
of
this
valley
will
be
the
social
destiny
and
will
mark
the
place
in
history
of
the
united
states
in
a
large
sense
and
in
the
one
usually
given
to
it
by
geographers
and
historians
the
mississippi
valley
includes
the
whole
interior
basin
a
province
which
drains
into
nearly
two
thousand
miles
of
navigable
waters
of
the
mississippi
itself
two
thousand
miles
of
the
tawny
flood
of
the
missouri
and
a
thousand
miles
of
the
ohio
five
thousand
miles
of
main
water
highways
open
to
the
steamboat
nearly
two
and
a
half
million
square
miles
of
drainage
basin
a
land
greater
than
all
europe
except
russia
norway
and
sweden
a
land
of
levels
marked
by
essential
geographic
unity
a
land
estimated
to
be
able
to
support
a
population
of
two
or
three
hundred
millions
three
times
the
present
population
of
the
whole
nation
an
empire
of
natural
resources
in
which
to
build
a
noble
social
structure
worthy
to
hold
its
place
as
the
heart
of
american
industrial
political
and
spiritual
life
the
significance
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
american
history
was
first
shown
in
the
fact
that
it
opened
to
various
nations
visions
of
power
in
the
new
world
visions
that
sweep
across
the
horizon
of
historical
possibility
like
the
luminous
but
unsubstantial
aurora
of
a
train
portentous
and
fleeting
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
primitive
history
of
the
continent
are
being
drawn
the
evidences
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
indian
cultures
the
migrations
through
and
into
the
great
valley
by
men
of
the
stone
age
hinted
at
in
legends
and
languages
dimly
told
in
the
records
of
mounds
and
artifacts
but
waiting
still
for
complete
interpretation
into
these
spaces
and
among
the
savage
peoples
came
france
and
wrote
a
romantic
page
in
our
early
history
a
page
that
tells
of
unfulfilled
empire
what
is
striking
in
the
effect
of
the
mississippi
valley
upon
france
is
the
pronounced
influence
of
the
unity
of
its
great
spaces
it
is
not
without
meaning
that
radisson
and
groseilliers
not
only
reached
the
extreme
of
lake
superior
but
also
in
all
probability
entered
upon
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
and
learned
of
its
western
affluent
that
marquette
not
only
received
the
indians
of
the
illinois
region
in
his
post
on
the
shores
of
lake
superior
but
traversed
the
length
of
the
mississippi
almost
to
its
mouth
and
returning
revealed
the
site
of
chicago
that
la
salle
was
inspired
with
the
vision
of
a
huge
interior
empire
reaching
from
the
gulf
to
the
great
lakes
before
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
perrot
influence
was
supreme
in
the
upper
mississippi
while
was
laying
the
foundations
of
louisiana
toward
the
mouth
of
the
river
nor
is
it
without
significance
that
while
the
verendryes
were
advancing
toward
the
northwest
where
they
discovered
the
big
horn
mountains
and
revealed
the
natural
boundaries
of
the
valley
the
mallet
brothers
were
ascending
the
platte
crossing
the
colorado
plains
to
santa
fé
and
so
revealing
the
natural
boundaries
toward
the
southwest
to
the
english
the
great
valley
was
a
land
beyond
the
alleghanies
spotswood
the
governor
of
virginia
predecessor
of
frontier
builders
grasped
the
situation
when
he
proposed
western
settlements
to
prevent
the
french
from
becoming
a
great
people
at
the
back
of
the
colonies
he
realized
the
importance
of
the
mississippi
valley
as
the
field
for
expansion
and
the
necessity
to
the
english
empire
of
dominating
it
if
england
would
remain
the
great
power
of
the
new
world
in
the
war
that
followed
between
france
and
england
we
now
see
what
the
men
of
the
time
could
not
have
realized
that
the
main
issue
was
neither
the
possession
of
the
fisheries
nor
the
approaches
to
the
lawrence
on
the
one
hemisphere
nor
the
possession
of
india
on
the
other
but
the
mastery
of
the
interior
basin
of
north
america
how
little
the
nations
realized
the
true
meaning
of
the
final
victory
of
england
is
shown
in
the
fact
that
spain
reluctantly
received
from
france
the
cession
of
the
lands
beyond
the
mississippi
accepting
it
as
a
means
of
preventing
the
infringement
of
her
colonial
monopoly
in
spanish
america
rather
than
as
a
field
for
imperial
expansion
but
we
know
now
that
when
george
washington
came
as
a
stripling
to
the
camp
of
the
french
at
the
edge
of
the
great
valley
and
demanded
the
relinquishment
of
the
french
posts
in
the
name
of
virginia
he
was
demanding
in
the
name
of
the
english
speaking
people
the
right
to
occupy
and
rule
the
real
center
of
american
resources
and
power
when
braddock
axmen
cut
their
road
from
the
potomac
toward
the
forks
of
the
ohio
they
were
opening
a
channel
through
which
the
forces
of
civilization
should
flow
with
ever
increasing
momentum
and
carving
a
cross
on
the
wilderness
rim
at
the
spot
which
is
now
the
center
of
industrial
power
of
the
american
nation
england
trembled
on
the
brink
of
her
great
conquest
fearful
of
the
effect
of
these
rivers
upon
her
colonial
system
timorous
in
the
presence
of
the
fierce
peoples
who
held
the
vast
domain
beyond
the
alleghanies
it
seems
clear
however
that
the
proclamation
of
forbidding
settlement
and
the
patenting
of
lands
beyond
the
alleghanies
was
not
intended
as
a
permanent
creation
of
an
indian
reservation
out
of
this
valley
but
was
rather
a
temporary
arrangement
in
order
that
british
plans
might
mature
and
a
system
of
gradual
colonization
be
devised
already
our
greatest
leaders
men
like
washington
and
franklin
had
been
quick
to
see
the
importance
of
this
new
area
for
enlarged
activities
of
the
american
people
a
sudden
revelation
that
it
was
the
west
rather
than
the
ocean
which
was
the
real
theater
for
the
creative
energy
of
america
came
with
the
triumph
over
france
the
ohio
company
and
the
loyal
land
company
indicate
the
interest
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
while
the
mississippi
company
headed
by
the
washingtons
and
lees
organized
to
occupy
southern
illinois
indiana
and
western
kentucky
mark
the
virginia
interest
in
the
mississippi
valley
and
franklin
activity
in
promoting
a
colony
in
the
illinois
country
illustrates
the
interest
of
the
philadelphians
indeed
franklin
saw
clearly
the
possibilities
of
a
settlement
there
as
a
means
of
breaking
up
spanish
america
writing
to
his
son
in
he
declared
that
a
settlement
should
be
made
in
the
illinois
country
raising
a
strength
there
which
on
occasions
of
a
future
war
might
easily
be
poured
down
the
mississippi
upon
the
lower
country
and
into
the
bay
of
mexico
to
be
used
against
cuba
the
french
islands
or
mexico
itself
the
mississippi
valley
had
been
the
despair
of
france
in
the
matter
of
governmental
control
the
coureurs
de
bois
escaping
from
restraints
of
law
and
order
took
their
way
through
its
extensive
wilderness
exploring
and
trading
as
they
listed
similarly
when
the
english
colonists
crossed
the
alleghanies
they
escaped
from
the
control
of
mother
colonies
as
well
as
of
the
mother
country
if
the
mississippi
valley
revealed
to
the
statesmen
of
the
east
in
the
exultation
of
the
war
with
france
an
opportunity
for
new
empire
building
it
revealed
to
the
frontiersmen
who
penetrated
the
passes
of
the
alleghanies
and
entered
into
their
new
inheritance
the
sharp
distinctions
between
them
and
the
eastern
lands
which
they
left
behind
from
the
beginning
it
was
clear
that
the
lands
beyond
the
alleghanies
furnished
an
opportunity
and
an
incentive
to
develop
american
society
on
independent
and
unconventional
lines
the
men
of
the
western
waters
broke
with
the
old
order
of
things
subordinated
social
restraint
to
the
freedom
of
the
individual
won
their
title
to
the
rich
lands
which
they
entered
by
hard
fighting
against
the
indians
hotly
challenged
the
right
of
the
east
to
rule
them
demanded
their
own
states
and
would
not
be
refused
spoke
with
contempt
of
the
old
social
order
of
ranks
and
classes
in
the
lands
between
the
alleghanies
and
the
atlantic
and
proclaimed
the
ideal
of
democracy
for
the
vast
country
which
they
had
entered
not
with
the
mercurial
facility
of
the
french
did
they
follow
the
river
systems
of
the
great
valley
like
the
advance
of
the
glacier
they
changed
the
face
of
the
country
in
their
steady
and
inevitable
progress
and
they
sought
the
sea
it
was
not
long
before
the
spaniards
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
realized
the
meaning
of
the
new
forces
that
had
entered
the
valley
in
the
governor
of
louisiana
wrote
this
vast
and
restless
population
progressively
driving
the
indian
tribes
before
them
and
upon
us
seek
to
possess
themselves
of
all
the
extensive
regions
which
the
indians
occupy
between
the
ohio
and
mississippi
rivers
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
appalachian
mountains
thus
becoming
our
neighbors
at
the
same
time
that
they
menacingly
ask
for
the
free
navigation
of
the
mississippi
if
they
achieve
their
object
their
ambitions
would
not
be
confined
to
this
side
of
the
mississippi
their
writings
public
papers
and
speeches
all
turn
on
this
point
the
free
navigation
of
the
gulf
by
the
rivers
which
empty
into
it
the
rich
fur
trade
of
the
missouri
and
in
time
the
possession
of
the
rich
mines
of
the
interior
provinces
of
the
very
kingdom
of
mexico
their
mode
of
growth
and
their
policy
are
as
formidable
for
spain
as
their
armies
their
roving
spirit
and
the
readiness
with
which
they
procure
sustenance
and
shelter
facilitate
rapid
settlement
a
rifle
and
a
little
corn
meal
in
a
bag
are
enough
for
an
american
wandering
alone
in
the
woods
for
a
month
with
logs
crossed
upon
one
another
he
makes
a
house
and
even
an
impregnable
fort
against
the
indians
cold
does
not
terrify
him
and
when
a
family
wearies
of
one
place
it
moves
to
another
and
settles
there
with
the
same
ease
if
such
men
come
to
occupy
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
and
missouri
or
secure
their
navigation
doubtless
nothing
will
prevent
them
from
crossing
and
penetrating
into
our
provinces
on
the
other
side
which
being
to
a
great
extent
unoccupied
can
oppose
no
resistance
in
my
opinion
a
general
revolution
in
america
threatens
spain
unless
the
remedy
be
applied
promptly
in
fact
the
pioneers
who
had
occupied
the
uplands
of
the
south
the
backwoods
stock
with
its
leaders
which
had
formed
on
the
eastern
edge
of
the
alleghanies
separate
and
distinct
from
the
type
of
tidewater
and
new
england
had
found
in
the
mississippi
valley
a
new
field
for
expansion
under
conditions
of
free
land
and
unrestraint
these
conditions
gave
it
promise
of
ample
time
to
work
out
its
own
social
type
but
first
of
all
these
men
who
were
occupying
the
western
waters
must
find
an
outlet
for
their
surplus
products
if
they
were
to
become
a
powerful
people
while
the
alleghanies
placed
a
veto
toward
the
east
the
mississippi
opened
a
broad
highway
to
the
south
its
swift
current
took
their
flat
boats
in
its
strong
arms
to
bear
them
to
the
sea
but
across
the
outlet
of
the
great
river
spain
drew
the
barrier
of
her
colonial
monopoly
and
denied
them
exit
the
significance
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
american
history
at
the
opening
of
the
new
republic
therefore
lay
in
the
fact
that
beyond
the
area
of
the
social
and
political
control
of
the
thirteen
colonies
there
had
arisen
a
new
and
aggressive
society
which
imperiously
put
the
questions
of
the
public
lands
internal
communication
local
defense
and
aggressive
expansion
before
the
legislators
of
the
old
colonial
régime
the
men
of
the
mississippi
valley
compelled
the
men
of
the
east
to
think
in
american
terms
instead
of
european
they
dragged
a
reluctant
nation
on
in
a
new
course
from
the
revolution
to
the
end
of
the
war
of
europe
regarded
the
destiny
of
the
mississippi
valley
as
undetermined
spain
desired
to
maintain
her
hold
by
means
of
the
control
given
through
the
possession
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
the
gulf
by
her
influence
upon
the
indian
tribes
and
by
intrigues
with
the
settlers
her
object
was
primarily
to
safeguard
the
spanish
american
monopoly
which
had
made
her
a
great
nation
in
the
world
instinctively
she
seemed
to
surmise
that
out
of
this
valley
were
the
issues
of
her
future
here
was
the
lever
which
might
break
successively
from
her
empire
fragments
about
the
gulf
louisiana
florida
and
texas
cuba
and
porto
rico
the
southwest
and
pacific
coast
and
even
the
philippines
and
the
isthmian
canal
while
the
american
republic
building
itself
on
the
resources
of
the
valley
should
become
paramount
over
the
independent
republics
into
which
her
empire
was
to
disintegrate
france
seeking
to
regain
her
former
colonial
power
would
use
the
mississippi
valley
as
a
means
of
provisioning
her
west
indian
islands
of
dominating
spanish
america
and
of
subordinating
to
her
purposes
the
feeble
united
states
which
her
policy
assigned
to
the
lands
between
the
atlantic
and
the
alleghanies
the
ancient
bourbon
monarchy
the
revolutionary
republic

from

jefferson
wrote
in
embraced
from

side
by
their

on
the
other
by
their

we
need
not
hesitate
to
say
that
they
would
soon
find
means
to
unite
to
them
all
the
territory
covered
by
the
ramifications
of
the
mississippi
and
that
he
thought
must
result
in
bloody
and
eternal
war
or
indissoluble
confederacy
with
england
none
of
these
nations
deemed
it
impossible
that
american
settlers
in
the
mississippi
valley
might
be
won
to
accept
another
flag
than
that
of
the
united
states
gardoqui
had
the
effrontery
in
to
suggest
to
madison
that
the
kentuckians
would
make

france

the
support
of
frontiersmen
led
by
george
rogers
clark
for
her
attempted
conquest
of
louisiana
in
england
tried
to
win
support
among
the
western
settlers
indeed
when
we
recall
that
george
rogers
clark
accepted
a
commission
as
major
general
from
france
in
and
again
in
that
wilkinson
afterwards
of
the
american
army
secretly
asked
spanish
citizenship
and
promised
renunciation
of
his
american
allegiance
that
governor
sevier
of
franklin
afterwards
senator
from
tennessee
and
its
first
governor
as
a
state
robertson
the
founder
of
cumberland
and
blount
governor
of
the
southwest
territory
and
afterwards
senator
from
tennessee
were
all
willing
to
accept
the
rule
of
another
nation
sooner
than
see
the
navigation
of
the
mississippi
yielded
by
the
american
government
we
can
easily
believe
that
it
lay
within
the
realm
of
possibility
that
another
allegiance
might
have
been
accepted
by
the
frontiersmen
themselves
we
may
well
trust
rufus
putnam
whose
federalism
and
devotion
to
his
country
had
been
proved
and
whose
work
in
founding
new
england
settlement
at
marietta
is
well
known
when
he
wrote
in
in
answer
to
fisher
ames
question
whether
the
mississippi
valley
could
be
retained
in
the
union
should
congress
give
up
her
claim
to
the
navigation
of
the
mississippi
or
cede
it
to
the
spaniards
i
believe
the
people
in
the
western
quarter
would
separate
themselves
from
the
united
states
very
soon
such
a
measure
i
have
no
doubt
would
excite
so
much
rage
and
dissatisfaction
that
the
people
would
sooner
put
themselves
under
the
despotic
government
of
spain
than
remain
the
indented
servants
of
congress
he
added
that
if
congress
did
not
afford
due
protection
also
to
these
western
settlers
they
might
turn
to
england
or
spain
prior
to
the
railroad
the
mississippi
valley
was
potentially
the
basis
for
an
independent
empire
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
its
population
would
inevitably
be
drawn
from
the
eastern
states
its
natural
outlet
was
down
the
current
to
the
gulf
new
orleans
controlled
the
valley
in
the
words
of
wilkinson
as
the
key
the
lock
or
the
citadel
the
outworks
so
long
as
the
mississippi
valley
was
menaced
or
in
part
controlled
by
rival
european
states
just
so
long
must
the
united
states
be
a
part
of
the
state
system
of
europe
involved
in
its
fortunes
and
particularly
was
this
the
case
in
view
of
the
fact
that
until
the
union
made
internal
commerce
based
upon
the
mississippi
valley
its
dominant
economic
interest
the
merchants
and
sailors
of
the
northeastern
states
and
the
staple
producers
of
the
southern
were
a
commercial
appanage
of
europe
the
significance
of
the
mississippi
valley
was
clearly
seen
by
jefferson
writing
to
livingston
in
he
declared
there
is
on
the
globe
one
single
spot
the
possessor
of
which
is
our
natural
and
habitual
enemy
it
is
new
orleans
through
which
the
produce
of
of
our
territory
must
pass
to
market
and
from
its
fertility
it
will
ere
long
yield
more
than
half
of
our
whole
produce
and
contain
more
than
half
of
our
inhabitants
the
day
that
france
takes
possession
of
new
orleans
fixes
the
sentence
which
is
to
restrain
her
within
her
mark
it
seals
the
union
of
two
nations
who
in
conjunction
can
maintain
exclusive
possession
of
the
ocean
from
that
moment
we
must
marry
ourselves
to
the
british
fleet
and
nation
holding
the
two
continents
of
america
in
sequestration
for
the
common
purposes
of
the
united
british
and
american
nations
the
acquisition
of
louisiana
was
a
recognition
of
the
essential
unity
of
the
mississippi
valley
the
french
engineer
collot
reported
to
his
government
after
an
investigation
in
all
the
positions
on
the
left
east
bank
of
the
mississippi
without
the
alliance
of
the
western
states
are
far
from
covering
louisiana
when
two
nations
possess
one
the
coasts
and
the
other
the
plains
the
former
must
inevitably
embark
or
submit
from
thence
i
conclude
that
the
western
states
of
the
north
american
republic
must
unite
themselves
with
louisiana
and
form
in
the
future
one
single
compact
nation
or
else
that
colony
to
whatever
power
it
shall
belong
will
be
conquered
or
devoured
the
effect
of
bringing
political
unity
to
the
mississippi
valley
by
the
louisiana
purchase
was
profound
it
was
the
decisive
step
of
the
united
states
on
an
independent
career
as
a
world
power
free
from
entangling
foreign
alliances
the
victories
of
harrison
in
the
northwest
in
the
war
of
that
followed
ensured
our
expansion
in
the
northern
half
of
the
valley
jackson
triumphal
march
to
the
gulf
and
his
defense
of
new
orleans
in
the
same
war
won
the
basis
for
that
cotton
kingdom
so
important
in
the
economic
life
of
the
nation
and
so
pregnant
with
the
issue
of
slavery
the
acquisition
of
florida
texas
and
the
far
west
followed
naturally
not
only
was
the
nation
set
on
an
independent
path
in
foreign
relations
its
political
system
was
revolutionized
for
the
mississippi
valley
now
opened
the
way
for
adding
state
after
state
swamping
the
new
england
section
and
its
federalism
the
doctrine
of
strict
construction
had
received
a
fatal
blow
at
the
hands
of
its
own
prophet
the
old
conception
of
historic
sovereign
states
makers
of
a
federation
was
shattered
by
this
vast
addition
of
raw
material
for
an
indefinite
number
of
parallelograms
called
states
nursed
through
a
territorial
period
by
the
federal
government
admitted
under
conditions
and
animated
by
national
rather
than
by
state
patriotism
the
area
of
the
nation
had
been
so
enlarged
and
the
development
of
the
internal
resources
so
promoted
by
the
acquisition
of
the
whole
course
of
the
mighty
river
its
tributaries
and
its
outlet
that
the
atlantic
coast
soon
turned
its
economic
energies
from
the
sea
to
the
interior
cities
and
sections
began
to
struggle
for
ascendancy
over
its
industrial
life
a
real
national
activity
a
genuine
american
culture
began
the
vast
spaces
the
huge
natural
resources
of
the
valley
demanded
exploitation
and
population
later
there
came
the
tide
of
foreign
immigration
which
has
risen
so
steadily
that
it
has
made
a
composite
american
people
whose
amalgamation
is
destined
to
produce
a
new
national
stock
but
without
attempting
to
exhaust
or
even
to
indicate
all
the
effects
of
the
louisiana
purchase
i
wish
next
to
ask
your
attention
to
the
significance
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
the
promotion
of
democracy
and
the
transfer
of
the
political
center
of
gravity
in
the
nation
the
mississippi
valley
has
been
the
especial
home
of
democracy
born
of
free
land
and
the
pioneer
spirit
nurtured
in
the
ideas
of
the
revolution
and
finding
free
play
for
these
ideas
in
the
freedom
of
the
wilderness
democracy
showed
itself
in
the
earliest
utterances
of
the
men
of
the
western
waters
and
it
has
persisted
there
the
demand
for
local
which
was
insistent
on
the
frontier
and
the
endorsement
given
by
the
alleghanies
to
these
demands
led
to
the
creation
of
a
system
of
independent
western
governments
and
to
the
ordinance
of
an
original
contribution
to
colonial
policy
this
was
framed
in
the
period
when
any
rigorous
subjection
of
the
west
to
eastern
rule
would
have
endangered
the
ties
that
bound
them
to
the
union
itself
in
the
constitutional
convention
prominent
eastern
statesmen
expressed
their
fears
of
the
western
democracy
and
would
have
checked
its
ability
to
the
regions
of
property
by
limiting
its
political
power
so
that
it
should
never
equal
that
of
the
atlantic
coast
but
more
liberal
counsels
prevailed
in
the
first
debates
upon
the
public
lands
also
it
was
clearly
stated
that
the
social
system
of
the
nation
was
involved
quite
as
much
as
the
question
of
revenue
eastern
fears
that
cheap
lands
in
abundance
would
depopulate
the
atlantic
states
and
check
their
industrial
growth
by
a
scarcity
of
labor
supply
were
met
by
the
answer
of
one
of
the
representatives
in
i
question
if
any
man
would
be
hardy
enough
to
point
out
a
class
of
citizens
by
name
that
ought
to
be
the
servants
of
the
community
yet
unless
that
is
done
to
what
class
of
the
people
could
you
direct
such
a
law
but
if
you
passed
such
an
act
limiting
the
area
offered
for
sale
in
the
mississippi
valley
it
would
be
tantamount
to
saying
that
there
is
some
class
which
must
remain
here
and
by
law
be
obliged
to
serve
the
others
for
such
wages
as
they
please
to
give
gallatin
showed
his
comprehension
of
the
basis
of
the
prosperous
american
democracy
in
the
same
debate
when
he
said
if
the
cause
of
the
happiness
of
this
country
was
examined
into
it
would
be
found
to
arise
as
much
from
the
great
plenty
of
land
in
proportion
to
the
inhabitants
which
their
citizens
enjoyed
as
from
the
wisdom
of
their
political
institutions
out
of
this
frontier
democratic
society
where
the
freedom
and
abundance
of
land
in
the
great
valley
opened
a
refuge
to
the
oppressed
in
all
regions
came
the
jacksonian
democracy
which
governed
the
nation
after
the
downfall
of
the
party
of
john
quincy
adams
its
center
rested
in
tennessee
the
region
from
which
so
large
a
portion
of
the
mississippi
valley
was
settled
by
descendants
of
the
men
of
the
upland
south
the
rule
of
the
mississippi
valley
is
seen
when
we
recall
the
place
that
tennessee
kentucky
and
missouri
held
in
both
parties
besides
jackson
clay
harrison
and
polk
we
count
such
presidential
candidates
as
hugh
white
and
john
bell
vice
president
johnson
grundy
the
chairman
of
the
finance
committee
and
benton
the
champion
of
western
radicalism
it
was
in
this
same
period
and
largely
by
reason
of
the
drainage
of
population
to
the
west
and
the
stir
in
the
air
raised
by
the
western
winds
of
jacksonian
democracy
that
most
of
the
older
states
reconstructed
their
constitutions
on
a
more
democratic
basis
from
the
mississippi
valley
where
there
were
liberal
suffrage
provisions
based
on
population
alone
instead
of
property
and
population
disregard
of
vested
interests
and
insistence
on
the
rights
of
man
came
the
inspiration
for
this
era
of
change
in
the
franchise
and
apportionment
of
reform
of
laws
for
imprisonment
for
debt
of
general
attacks
upon
monopoly
and
privilege
it
is
now
plain
wrote
jackson
in
that
the
war
is
to
be
carried
on
by
the
monied
aristocracy
of
the
few
against
the
democracy
of
numbers
the
prosperous
to
make
the
honest
laborers
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
through
the
credit
and
paper
system
by
this
time
the
mississippi
valley
had
grown
in
population
and
political
power
so
that
it
ranked
with
the
older
sections
the
next
indication
of
its
significance
in
american
history
which
i
shall
mention
is
its
position
in
shaping
the
economic
and
political
course
of
the
nation
between
the
close
of
the
war
of
and
the
slavery
struggle
in
the
mississippi
valley
had
a
population
of
about
a
hundred
thousand
or
of
that
of
the
united
states
as
a
whole
by
it
had
over
a
million
or
by
it
had
three
and
millions
or
over
by
over
six
millions
more
than
while
the
atlantic
coast
increased
only
a
million
and
a
half
souls
between
and
the
mississippi
valley
gained
nearly
three
millions
ohio
virgin
wilderness
in
was
half
a
century
later
nearly
as
populous
as
pennsylvania
and
twice
as
populous
as
massachusetts
while
virginia
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
were
gaining
souls
between
and
illinois
gained
indeed
the
growth
of
this
state
alone
excelled
that
of
the
entire
south
atlantic
states
these
figures
show
the
significance
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
its
pressure
upon
the
older
section
by
the
competition
of
its
cheap
lands
its
abundant
harvests
and
its
drainage
of
the
labor
supply
all
of
these
things
meant
an
upward
lift
to
the
eastern
wage
earner
but
they
meant
also
an
increase
of
political
power
in
the
valley
before
the
war
of
the
mississippi
valley
had
six
senators
new
england
ten
the
middle
states
ten
and
the
south
eight
by
the
mississippi
valley
had
senators
double
those
of
the
middle
states
and
new
england
combined
and
nearly
three
times
as
many
as
the
old
south
while
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
mississippi
valley
outweighed
any
one
of
the
old
sections
in
it
had
less
than
the
power
of
new
england
and
the
south
together
in
the
house
in
it
outweighed
them
both
combined
and
because
of
its
special
circumstances
it
held
the
balance
of
power
while
the
mississippi
valley
thus
rose
to
superior
political
power
as
compared
with
any
of
the
old
sections
its
economic
development
made
it
the
inciting
factor
in
the
industrial
life
of
the
nation
after
the
war
of
the
steamboat
revolutionized
the
transportation
facilities
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
each
economic
area
a
surplus
formed
demanding
an
outlet
and
demanding
returns
in
manufactures
the
spread
of
cotton
into
the
lower
mississippi
valley
and
the
gulf
plains
had
a
double
significance
this
transfer
of
the
center
of
cotton
production
away
from
the
atlantic
south
not
only
brought
increasing
hardship
and
increasing
unrest
to
the
east
as
the
competition
of
the
virgin
soils
depressed
atlantic
land
values
and
made
eastern
labor
increasingly
dear
but
the
price
of
cotton
fell
also
in
due
proportion
to
the
increase
in
production
by
the
mississippi
valley
while
the
transfer
of
economic
power
from
the
seaboard
south
to
the
cotton
kingdom
of
the
lower
mississippi
valley
was
in
progress
the
upper
mississippi
valley
was
leaping
forward
partly
under
the
stimulus
of
a
market
for
its
surplus
in
the
plantations
of
the
south
where
almost
exclusive
cultivation
of
the
great
staples
resulted
in
a
lack
of
foodstuffs
and
livestock
at
the
same
time
the
great
river
and
its
affluents
became
the
highway
of
a
commerce
that
reached
to
the
west
indies
the
atlantic
coast
europe
and
south
america
the
mississippi
valley
was
an
industrial
entity
from
pittsburgh
and
santa
fé
to
new
orleans
it
became
the
most
important
influence
in
american
politics
and
industry
washington
had
declared
in
that
it
was
the
part
of
wisdom
for
virginia
to
bind
the
west
to
the
east
by
ties
of
interest
through
internal
improvement
thereby
taking
advantage
of
the
extensive
and
valuable
trade
of
a
rising
empire
this
realization
of
the
fact
that
an
economic
empire
was
growing
up
beyond
the
mountains
stimulated
rival
cities
new
york
philadelphia
and
baltimore
to
engage
in
a
struggle
to
supply
the
west
with
goods
and
receive
its
products
this
resulted
in
an
attempt
to
break
down
the
barrier
of
the
alleghanies
by
internal
improvements
the
movement
became
especially
active
after
the
war
of
when
new
york
carried
out
de
witt
clinton
vast
conception
of
making
by
the

a
greater

which
should
drain
to

the
basin
of
the

a
writer
in
hunt
in
makes
the
significance
of
this
clearer
by
these
words
there
was
a
period
in
the
history
of
the
seaboard
cities
when
there
was
no
west
and
when
the
alleghany
mountains
formed
the
frontier
of
settlement
and
agricultural
production
during
that
epoch
the
seaboard
cities
north
and
south
grew
in
proportion
to
the
extent
and
fertility
of
the
country
in
their
rear
and
as
maryland
virginia
the
carolinas
and
georgia
were
more
productive
in
staples
valuable
to
commerce
than
the
colonies
north
of
them
the
cities
of
baltimore
norfolk
charleston
and
savannah
enjoyed
a
greater
trade
and
experienced
a
larger
growth
than
those
on
the
northern
seaboard
he
then
classifies
the
periods
of
city
development
into
three
the
provincial
limited
to
the
atlantic
seaboard
that
of
canal
and
turnpike
connected
with
the
mississippi
valley
and
that
of
railroad
connection
thus
he
was
able
to
show
how
norfolk
for
example
was
shut
off
from
the
enriching
currents
of
interior
trade
and
was
outstripped
by
new
york
the
efforts
of
philadelphia
baltimore
charleston
and
savannah
to
divert
the
trade
of
the
mississippi
system
to
their
own
ports
on
the
atlantic
and
the
rise
or
fall
of
these
cities
in
proportion
as
they
succeeded
are
a
sufficient
indication
of
the
meaning
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
american
industrial
life
what
colonial
empire
has
been
for
london
that
the
mississippi
valley
is
to
the
seaboard
cities
of
the
united
states
awakening
visions
of
industrial
empire
systematic
control
of
vast
spaces
producing
the
american
type
of
the
captain
of
industry
it
was
not
alone
city
rivalry
that
converged
upon
the
mississippi
valley
and
sought
its
alliance
sectional
rivalry
likewise
saw
that
the
balance
of
power
possessed
by
the
interior
furnished
an
opportunity
for
combinations
this
was
a
fundamental
feature
of
calhoun
policy
when
he
urged
the
seaboard
south
to
complete
a
railroad
system
to
tap
the
northwest
as
washington
had
hoped
to
make
western
trade
seek
its
outlet
in
virginia
and
build
up
the
industrial
power
of
the
old
dominion
by
enriching
intercourse
with
the
mississippi
valley
as
monroe
wished
to
bind
the
west
to
virginia
political
interests
and
as
de
witt
clinton
wished
to
attach
it
to
new
york
so
calhoun
and
hayne
would
make
georgia
and
carolina
the
commercial
center
of
the
union
and
the
two
most
powerful
and
influential
members
of
the
confederacy
by
draining
the
mississippi
valley
to
their
ports
i
believe
said
calhoun
that
the
success
of
a
connection
of
the
west
is
of
the
last
importance
to
us
politically
and
commercially
i
do
verily
believe
that
charleston
has
more
advantages
in
her
position
for
the
western
trade
than
any
city
on
the
atlantic
but
to
develop
them
we
ought
to
look
to
the
tennessee
instead
of
the
ohio
and
much
farther
to
the
west
than
cincinnati
or
lexington
this
was
the
secret
of
calhoun
advocacy
in
and
both
of
the
distribution
of
the
surplus
revenue
and
of
the
cession
of
the
public
lands
to
the
states
in
which
they
lay
as
an
inducement
to
the
west
to
ally
itself
with
southern
policies
and
it
is
the
key
to
the
readiness
of
calhoun
even
after
he
lost
his
nationalism
to
promote
internal
improvements
which
would
foster
the
southward
current
of
trade
on
the
mississippi
without
going
into
details
i
may
simply
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
clay
whole
system
of
internal
improvements
and
tariff
was
based
upon
the
place
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
american
life
it
was
the
upper
part
of
the
valley
and
especially
the
ohio
valley
that
furnished
the
votes
which
carried
the
tariffs
of
and
its
interests
profoundly
influenced
the
details
of
those
tariffs
and
its
need
of
internal
improvement
constituted
a
basis
for
sectional
bargaining
in
all
the
constructive
legislation
after
the
war
of
new
england
the
middle
region
and
the
south
each
sought
alliance
with
the
growing
section
beyond
the
mountains
american
legislation
bears
the
enduring
evidence
of
these
alliances
even
the
national
bank
found
in
this
valley
the
main
sphere
of
its
business
the
nation
had
turned
its
energies
to
internal
exploitation
and
sections
contended
for
the
economic
and
political
power
derived
from
connection
with
the
interior
but
already
the
mississippi
valley
was
beginning
to
stratify
both
socially
and
geographically
as
the
railroads
pushed
across
the
mountains
the
tide
of
new
england
and
new
york
colonists
and
german
immigrants
sought
the
basin
of
the
great
lakes
and
the
upper
mississippi
a
distinct
zone
industrially
and
socially
connected
with
new
england
was
forming
the
railroad
reinforced
the
erie
canal
and
as
de
bow
put
it
turned
back
the
tide
of
the
father
of
waters
so
that
its
outlet
was
in
new
york
instead
of
new
orleans
for
a
large
part
of
the
valley
below
the
northern
zone
was
the
border
zone
of
the
upland
south
the
region
of
compromise
including
both
banks
of
the
ohio
and
the
missouri
and
reaching
down
to
the
hills
on
the
north
of
the
gulf
plains
the
cotton
kingdom
based
on
slavery
found
its
center
in
the
fertile
soils
along
the
lower
mississippi
and
the
black
prairies
of
georgia
and
alabama
and
was
settled
largely
by
planters
from
the
old
cotton
lands
of
the
atlantic
states
the
mississippi
valley
had
rejuvenated
slavery
had
given
it
an
aggressive
tone
characteristic
of
western
life
thus
the
valley
found
itself
in
the
midst
of
the
slavery
struggle
at
the
very
time
when
its
own
society
had
lost
homogeneity
let
us
allow
two
leaders
one
of
the
south
and
one
of
the
north
to
describe
the
situation
and
first
let
the
south
speak
said
hammond
of
south
carolina
in
a
speech
in
the
senate
on
march
i
think
it
not
improper
that
i
should
attempt
to
bring
the
north
and
south
face
to
face
and
see
what
resources
each
of
us
might
have
in
the
contingency
of
separate
organizations
through
the
heart
of
our
country
runs
the
great
mississippi
the
father
of
waters
into
whose
bosom
are
poured
thousand
miles
of
tributary
streams
and
beyond
we
have
the
desert
prairie
wastes
to
protect
us
in
our
rear
can
you
hem
in
such
a
territory
as
that
you
talk
of
putting
up
a
wall
of
fire
around
eight
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
miles
so
situated
how
absurd
but
in
this
territory
lies
the
great
valley
of
the
mississippi
now
the
real
and
soon
to
be
the
acknowledged
seat
of
the
empire
of
the
world
the
sway
of
that
valley
will
be
as
great
as
ever
the
nile
knew
in
the
earlier
ages
of
mankind
we
own
the
most
of
it
the
most
valuable
part
of
it
belongs
to
us
now
and
although
those
who
have
settled
above
us
are
now
opposed
to
us
another
generation
will
tell
a
different
tale
they
are
ours
by
all
the
laws
of
nature
slave
labor
will
go
to
every
foot
of
this
great
valley
where
it
will
be
found
profitable
to
use
it
and
some
of
those
who
may
not
use
it
are
soon
to
be
united
with
us
by
such
ties
as
will
make
us
one
and
inseparable
the
iron
horse
will
soon
be
clattering
over
the
sunny
plains
of
the
south
to
bear
the
products
of
its
upper
tributaries
to
our
atlantic
ports
as
it
now
does
through
the
north
there
is
the
great
mississippi
bond
of
union
made
by
nature
herself
she
will
maintain
it
forever
as
the
seaboard
south
had
transferred
the
mantle
of
leadership
to
tennessee
and
then
to
the
cotton
kingdom
of
the
lower
mississippi
so
new
england
and
new
york
resigned
their
command
to
the
northern
half
of
the
mississippi
valley
and
the
basin
of
the
great
lakes
seward
the
leader
of
the
eastern
whigs
who
had
just
lost
the
republican
nomination
for
the
presidency
to
lincoln
may
rightfully
speak
for
the
northeast
in
the
fall
of
addressing
an
audience
at
madison
wisconsin
he
declared
the
empire
established
at
washington
is
of
less
than
a
hundred
years
formation
it
was
the
empire
of
thirteen
atlantic
states
still
practically
the
mission
of
that
empire
is
fulfilled
the
power
that
directs
it
is
ready
to
pass
away
from
those
thirteen
states
and
although
held
and
exercised
under
the
same
constitution
and
national
form
of
government
yet
it
is
now
in
the
very
act
of
being
transferred
from
the
thirteen
states
east
of
the
alleghany
mountains
and
on
the
coast
of
the
atlantic
ocean
to
the
twenty
states
that
lie
west
of
the
alleghanies
and
stretch
away
from
their
base
to
the
base
of
the
rocky
mountains
on
the
west
and
you
are
the
heirs
to
it
when
the
next
census
shall
reveal
your
power
you
will
be
found
to
be
the
masters
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
through
them
the
dominating
political
power
of
the
world
appealing
to
the
northwest
on
the
slavery
issue
seward
declared
the
whole
responsibility
rests
henceforth
directly
or
indirectly
on
the
people
of
the
northwest
there
can
be
no
virtue
in
commercial
and
manufacturing
communities
to
maintain
a
democracy
when
the
democracy
themselves
do
not
want
a
democracy
there
is
no
virtue
in
pearl
street
in
wall
street
in
court
street
in
chestnut
street
in
any
other
street
of
great
commercial
cities
that
can
save
the
great
democratic
government
of
ours
when
you
cease
to
uphold
it
with
your
intelligent
votes
your
strong
and
mighty
hands
you
must
therefore
lead
us
as
we
heretofore
reserved
and
prepared
the
way
for
you
we
resign
to
you
the
banner
of
human
rights
and
human
liberty
on
this
continent
and
we
bid
you
be
firm
bold
and
onward
and
then
you
may
hope
that
we
will
be
able
to
follow
you
when
we
survey
the
course
of
the
slavery
struggle
in
the
united
states
it
is
clear
that
the
form
the
question
took
was
due
to
the
mississippi
valley
the
ordinance
of
the
missouri
compromise
the
texas
question
the
free
soil
agitation
the
compromise
of
the
bill
the
dred
scott
decision
bleeding
kansas
these
are
all
mississippi
valley
questions
and
the
mere
enumeration
makes
it
plain
that
it
was
the
mississippi
valley
as
an
area
for
expansion
which
gave
the
slavery
issue
its
significance
in
american
history
but
for
this
field
of
expansion
slavery
might
have
fulfilled
the
expectation
of
the
fathers
and
gradually
died
away
of
the
significance
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
the
civil
war
it
is
unnecessary
that
i
should
speak
illinois
gave
to
the
north
its
president
mississippi
gave
to
the
south
its
president
lincoln
and
davis
were
both
born
in
kentucky
grant
and
sherman
the
northern
generals
came
from
the
mississippi
valley
and
both
of
them
believed
that
when
vicksburg
fell
the
cause
of
the
south
was
lost
and
so
it
must
have
been
if
the
confederacy
had
been
unable
after
victories
in
the
east
to
regain
the
father
of
waters
for
as
general
sherman
said
whatever
power
holds
that
river
can
govern
this
continent
with
the
close
of
the
war
political
power
passed
for
many
years
to
the
northern
half
of
the
mississippi
valley
as
the
names
of
grant
hayes
garfield
harrison
and
mckinley
indicate
the
population
of
the
valley
grew
from
about
fifteen
millions
in
to
over
forty
millions
in
over
half
the
total
population
of
the
united
states
the
significance
of
its
industrial
growth
is
not
likely
to
be
overestimated
or
overlooked
on
its
northern
border
from
near
minnesota
boundary
line
through
the
great
lakes
to
pittsburgh
on
its
eastern
edge
runs
a
huge
movement
of
iron
from
mine
to
factory
this
industry
is
basal
in
american
life
and
it
has
revolutionized
the
industry
of
the
world
the
united
states
produces
pig
iron
and
steel
in
amount
equal
to
her
two
greatest
competitors
combined
and
the
iron
ores
for
this
product
are
chiefly
in
the
mississippi
valley
it
is
the
chief
producer
of
coal
thereby
enabling
the
united
states
almost
to
equal
the
combined
production
of
germany
and
great
britain
and
great
oil
fields
of
the
nation
are
in
its
midst
its
huge
crops
of
wheat
and
corn
and
its
cattle
are
the
main
resources
for
the
united
states
and
are
drawn
upon
by
europe
its
cotton
furnishes
of
the
world
factory
supply
its
railroad
system
constitutes
the
greatest
transportation
network
in
the
world
again
it
is
seeking
industrial
consolidation
by
demanding
improvement
of
its
vast
water
system
as
a
unit
if
this
design
favored
by
roosevelt
shall
at
some
time
be
accomplished
again
the
bulk
of
the
commerce
of
the
valley
may
flow
along
the
old
routes
to
new
orleans
and
to
galveston
by
the
development
of
southern
railroad
outlets
after
the
building
of
the
panama
canal
for
the
development
and
exploitation
of
these
and
of
the
transportation
and
trade
interests
of
the
middle
west
eastern
capital
has
been
consolidated
into
huge
corporations
trusts
and
combinations
with
the
influx
of
capital
and
the
rise
of
cities
and
manufactures
portions
of
the
mississippi
valley
have
become
assimilated
with
the
east
with
the
end
of
the
era
of
free
lands
the
basis
of
its
democratic
society
is
passing
away
the
final
topic
on
which
i
shall
briefly
comment
in
this
discussion
of
the
significance
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
american
history
is
a
corollary
of
this
condition
has
the
mississippi
valley
a
permanent
contribution
to
make
to
american
society
or
is
it
to
be
adjusted
into
a
type
characteristically
eastern
and
european
in
other
words
has
the
united
states
itself
an
original
contribution
to
make
to
the
history
of
society
this
is
what
it
comes
to
the
most
significant
fact
in
the
mississippi
valley
is
its
ideals
here
has
been
developed
not
by
revolutionary
theory
but
by
growth
among
free
opportunities
the
conception
of
a
vast
democracy
made
up
of
mobile
ascending
individuals
conscious
of
their
power
and
their
responsibilities
can
these
ideals
of
individualism
and
democracy
be
reconciled
and
applied
to
the
twentieth
century
type
of
civilization
other
nations
have
been
rich
and
prosperous
and
powerful
and
no
other
nation
on
a
vast
scale
has
been
controlled
by
a
democracy
in
the
interests
of
progress
and
freedom
industrial
as
well
as
political
it
is
in
the
vast
and
level
spaces
of
the
mississippi
valley
if
anywhere
that
the
forces
of
social
transformation
and
the
modification
of
its
democratic
ideals
may
be
arrested
beginning
with
competitive
individualism
as
well
as
with
belief
in
equality
the
farmers
of
the
mississippi
valley
gradually
learned
that
unrestrained
competition
and
combination
meant
the
triumph
of
the
strongest
the
seizure
in
the
interest
of
a
dominant
class
of
the
strategic
points
of
the
nation
life
they
learned
that
between
the
ideal
of
individualism
unrestrained
by
society
and
the
ideal
of
democracy
was
an
innate
conflict
that
their
very
ambitions
and
forcefulness
had
endangered
their
democracy
the
significance
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
american
history
has
lain
partly
in
the
fact
that
it
was
a
region
of
revolt
here
have
arisen
varied
sometimes
but
always
devoted
movements
for
ameliorating
the
lot
of
the
common
man
in
the
interests
of
democracy
out
of
the
mississippi
valley
have
come
successive
and
related
tidal
waves
of
popular
demand
for
real
or
imagined
legislative
safeguards
to
their
rights
and
their
social
ideals
the
granger
movement
the
greenback
movement
the
populist
movement
bryan
democracy
and
roosevelt
republicanism
all
found
their
greatest
strength
in
the
mississippi
valley
they
were
mississippi
valley
ideals
in
action
its
people
were
learning
by
experiment
and
experience
how
to
grapple
with
the
fundamental
problem
of
creating
a
just
social
order
that
shall
sustain
the
free
progressive
individual
in
a
real
democracy
the
mississippi
valley
is
asking
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
the
mississippi
valley
has
furnished
a
new
social
order
to
america
its
universities
have
set
new
types
of
institutions
for
social
service
and
for
the
elevation
of
the
plain
people
its
historians
should
recount
its
old
ambitions
and
inventory
its
ideals
as
well
as
its
resources
for
the
information
of
the
present
age
to
the
end
that
building
on
its
past
the

the
problem
of
the
west
the
problem
of
the
west
is
nothing
less
than
the
problem
of
american
development
a
glance
at
the
map
of
the
united
states
reveals
the
truth
to
write
of
a
western
sectionalism
bounded
on
the
east
by
the
alleghanies
is
in
itself
to
proclaim
the
writer
a
provincial
what
is
the
west
what
has
it
been
in
american
life
to
have
the
answers
to
these
questions
is
to
understand
the
most
significant
features
of
the
united
states
of
the
west
at
bottom
is
a
form
of
society
rather
than
an
area
it
is
the
term
applied
to
the
region
whose
social
conditions
result
from
the
application
of
older
institutions
and
ideas
to
the
transforming
influences
of
free
land
by
this
application
a
new
environment
is
suddenly
entered
freedom
of
opportunity
is
opened
the
cake
of
custom
is
broken
and
new
activities
new
lines
of
growth
new
institutions
and
new
ideals
are
brought
into
existence
the
wilderness
disappears
the
west
proper
passes
on
to
a
new
frontier
and
in
the
former
area
a
new
society
has
emerged
from
its
contact
with
the
backwoods
gradually
this
society
loses
its
primitive
conditions
and
assimilates
itself
to
the
type
of
the
older
social
conditions
of
the
east
but
it
bears
within
it
enduring
and
distinguishing
survivals
of
its
frontier
experience
decade
after
decade
west
after
west
this
rebirth
of
american
society
has
gone
on
has
left
its
traces
behind
it
and
has
reacted
on
the
east
the
history
of
our
political
institutions
our
democracy
is
not
a
history
of
imitation
of
simple
borrowing
it
is
a
history
of
the
evolution
and
adaptation
of
organs
in
response
to
changed
environment
a
history
of
the
origin
of
new
political
species
in
this
sense
therefore
the
west
has
been
a
constructive
force
of
the
highest
significance
in
our
life
to
use
the
words
of
that
acute
and
widely
informed
observer
bryce
the
west
is
the
most
american
part
of
america
what
europe
is
to
asia
what
america
is
to
england
that
the
western
states
and
territories
are
to
the
atlantic
states
the
west
as
a
phase
of
social
organization
began
with
the
atlantic
coast
and
passed
across
the
continent
but
the
colonial
area
was
in
close
touch
with
the
old
world
and
soon
lost
its
western
aspects
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
newer
social
conditions
appeared
along
the
upper
waters
of
the
tributaries
of
the
atlantic
here
it
was
that
the
west
took
on
its
distinguishing
features
and
transmitted
frontier
traits
and
ideals
to
this
area
in
later
days
on
the
coast
were
the
fishermen
and
skippers
the
merchants
and
planters
with
eyes
turned
toward
europe
beyond
the
falls
of
the
rivers
were
the
pioneer
farmers
largely
of
stock
and
german
they
constituted
a
distinct
people
and
may
be
regarded
as
an
expansion
of
the
social
and
economic
life
of
the
middle
region
into
the
back
country
of
the
south
these
frontiersmen
were
the
ancestors
of
boone
andrew
jackson
calhoun
clay
and
lincoln
washington
and
jefferson
were
profoundly
affected
by
these
frontier
conditions
the
forest
clearings
have
been
the
seed
plots
of
american
character
in
the
revolutionary
days
the
settlers
crossed
the
alleghanies
and
put
a
barrier
between
them
and
the
coast
they
became
to
use
their
phrases
the
men
of
the
western
waters
the
heirs
of
the
western
world
in
this
era
the
backwoodsmen
all
along
the
western
slopes
of
the
mountains
with
a
keen
sense
of
the
difference
between
them
and
the
dwellers
on
the
coast
demanded
organization
into
independent
states
of
the
union
was
their
ideal
said
one
of
their
rude
but
energetic
petitions
for
statehood
some
of
our
may
think
we
are
not
able
to
conduct
our
affairs
and
consult
our
interests
but
if
our
society
is
rude
much
wisdom
is
not
necessary
to
supply
our
wants
and
a
fool
can
sometimes
put
on
his
clothes
better
than
a
wise
man
can
do
it
for
him
this
forest
philosophy
is
the
philosophy
of
american
democracy
but
the
men
of
the
coast
were
not
ready
to
admit
its
implications
they
apportioned
the
state
legislatures
so
that
the
minority
of
the
lands
were
able
to
outvote
the
more
populous
back
countries
a
similar
system
was
proposed
by
federalists
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
gouverneur
morris
arguing
in
favor
of
basing
representation
on
property
as
well
as
numbers
declared
that
he
looked
forward
also
to
that
range
of
new
states
which
would
soon
be
formed
in
the
west
he
thought
the
rule
of
representation
ought
to
be
so
fixed
as
to
secure
to
the
atlantic
states
a
prevalence
in
the
national
councils
the
new
states
said
he
will
know
less
of
the
public
interest
than
these
will
have
an
interest
in
many
respects
different
in
particular
will
be
little
scrupulous
of
involving
the
community
in
wars
the
burdens
and
operations
of
which
would
fall
chiefly
on
the
maritime
states
provision
ought
therefore
to
be
made
to
prevent
the
maritime
states
from
being
hereafter
outvoted
by
them
he
added
that
the
western
country
would
not
be
able
to
furnish
men
equally
enlightened
to
share
in
the
administration
of
our
common
interests
the
busy
haunts
of
men
not
the
remote
wilderness
was
the
proper
school
of
political
talents
if
the
western
people
get
power
into
their
hands
they
will
ruin
the
atlantic
interest
the
back
members
are
always
most
averse
to
the
best
measures
add
to
these
utterances
of
gouverneur
morris
the
impassioned
protest
of
josiah
quincy
of
massachusetts
in
the
debates
in
the
house
of
representatives
on
the
admission
of
louisiana
referring
to
the
discussion
over
the
slave
votes
and
the
west
in
the
constitutional
convention
he
declared
suppose
then
that
it
had
been
distinctly
foreseen
that
in
addition
to
the
effect
of
this
weight
the
whole
population
of
a
world
beyond
the
mississippi
was
to
be
brought
into
this
and
the
other
branch
of
the
legislature
to
form
our
laws
control
our
rights
and
decide
our
destiny
sir
can
it
be
pretended
that
the
patriots
of
that
day
would
for
one
moment
have
listened
to
it
they
had
not
taken
degrees
at
the
hospital
of
idiocy
why
sir
i
have
already
heard
of
six
states
and
some
say
there
will
be
at
no
great
distant
time
more
i
have
also
heard
that
the
mouth
of
the
ohio
will
be
far
to
the
east
of
the
center
of
the
contemplated
empire
you
have
no
authority
to
throw
the
rights
and
property
of
this
people
into
with
the
wild
men
on
the
missouri
nor
with
the
mixed
though
more
respectable
race
of
who
bask
on
the
sands
in
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
do
you
suppose
the
people
of
the
northern
and
atlantic
states
will
or
ought
to
look
on
with
patience
and
see
representatives
and
senators
from
the
red
river
and
missouri
pouring
themselves
upon
this
and
the
other
floor
managing
the
concerns
of
a
seaboard
fifteen
hundred
miles
at
least
from
their
residence
and
having
a
preponderancy
in
councils
into
which
constitutionally
they
could
never
have
been
admitted
like
an
echo
from
the
fears
expressed
by
the
east
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
come
the
words
of
an
eminent
eastern
man
of
letters
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
warning
against
the
west
materialized
in
their
temper
with
few
ideals
of
an
ennobling
sort
little
instructed
in
the
lessons
of
history
safe
from
exposure
to
the
direct
calamities
and
physical
horrors
of
war
with
undeveloped
imaginations
and
sympathies
they
form
a
community
unfortunate
and
dangerous
from
the
possession
of
power
without
a
due
sense
of
its
corresponding
responsibilities
a
community
in
which
the
passion
for
war
may
easily
be
excited
as
the
fancied
means
by
which
its
greatness
may
be
convincingly
exhibited
and
its
ambitions
gratified
some
chance
spark
may
fire
the
prairie
here
then
is
the
problem
of
the
west
as
it
looked
to
new
england
leaders
of
thought
in
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
this
century
from
the
first
it
was
recognized
that
a
new
type
was
growing
up
beyond
the
seaboard
and
that
the
time
would
come
when
the
destiny
of
the
nation
would
be
in
western
hands
the
divergence
of
these
societies
became
clear
in
the
struggle
over
the
ratification
of
the
federal
constitution
the
agricultural
regions
the
communities
that
were
in
debt
and
desired
paper
money
with
some
western
exceptions
opposed
the
instrument
but
the
areas
of
intercourse
and
property
carried
the
day
it
is
important
to
understand
therefore
what
were
some
of
the
ideals
of
this
early
western
democracy
how
did
the
frontiersman
differ
from
the
man
of
the
coast
the
most
obvious
fact
regarding
the
man
of
the
western
waters
is
that
he
had
placed
himself
under
influences
destructive
to
many
of
the
gains
of
civilization
remote
from
the
opportunity
for
systematic
education
substituting
a
log
hut
in
the
for
the
social
comforts
of
the
town
he
suffered
hardships
and
privations
and
reverted
in
many
ways
to
primitive
conditions
of
life
engaged
in
a
struggle
to
subdue
the
forest
working
as
an
individual
and
with
little
specie
or
capital
his
interests
were
with
the
debtor
class
at
each
stage
of
its
advance
the
west
has
favored
an
expansion
of
the
currency
the
pioneer
had
boundless
confidence
in
the
future
of
his
own
community
and
when
seasons
of
financial
contraction
and
depression
occurred
he
who
had
staked
his
all
on
confidence
in
western
development
and
had
fought
the
savage
for
his
home
was
inclined
to
reproach
the
conservative
sections
and
classes
to
explain
this
antagonism
requires
more
than
denunciation
of
dishonesty
ignorance
and
boorishness
as
fundamental
western
traits
legislation
in
the
united
states
has
had
to
deal
with
two
distinct
social
conditions
in
some
portions
of
the
country
there
was
and
is
an
aggregation
of
property
and
vested
rights
are
in
the
foreground
in
others
capital
is
lacking
more
primitive
conditions
prevail
with
different
economic
and
social
ideals
and
the
contentment
of
the
average
individual
is
placed
in
the
foreground
that
in
the
conflict
between
these
two
ideals
an
even
hand
has
always
been
held
by
the
government
would
be
difficult
to
show
the
separation
of
the
western
man
from
the
seaboard
and
his
environment
made
him
in
a
large
degree
free
from
european
precedents
and
forces
he
looked
at
things
independently
and
with
small
regard
or
appreciation
for
the
best
old
world
experience
he
had
no
ideal
of
a
philosophical
eclectic
nation
that
should
advance
civilization
by
intercourse
with
foreigners
and
familiarity
with
their
point
of
view
and
readiness
to
adopt
whatever
is
best
and
most
suitable
in
their
ideas
manners
and
customs
his
was
rather
the
ideal
of
conserving
and
developing
what
was
original
and
valuable
in
this
new
country
the
entrance
of
old
society
upon
free
lands
meant
to
him
opportunity
for
a
new
type
of
democracy
and
new
popular
ideals
the
west
was
not
conservative
buoyant
and
were
distinguishing
traits
in
its
composition
it
saw
in
its
growth
nothing
less
than
a
new
order
of
society
and
state
in
this
conception
were
elements
of
evil
and
elements
of
good
but
the
fundamental
fact
in
regard
to
this
new
society
was
its
relation
to
land
professor
boutmy
has
said
of
the
united
states
their
one
primary
and
predominant
object
is
to
cultivate
and
settle
these
prairies
forests
and
vast
waste
lands
the
striking
and
peculiar
characteristic
of
american
society
is
that
it
is
not
so
much
a
democracy
as
a
huge
commercial
company
for
the
discovery
cultivation
and
capitalization
of
its
enormous
territory
the
united
states
are
primarily
a
commercial
society
and
only
secondarily
a
nation
of
course
this
involves
a
serious
misapprehension
by
the
very
fact
of
the
task
here
set
forth
ideals
of
the
state
and
of
society
have
been
evolved
in
the
west
accompanied
by
loyalty
to
the
nation
representative
of
these
ideals
but
boutmy
description
hits
the
substantial
fact
that
the
fundamental
traits
of
the
man
of
the
interior
were
due
to
the
free
lands
of
the
west
these
turned
his
attention
to
the
great
task
of
subduing
them
to
the
purposes
of
civilization
and
to
the
task
of
advancing
his
economic
and
social
status
in
the
new
democracy
which
he
was
helping
to
create
art
literature
refinement
scientific
administration
all
had
to
give
way
to
this
titanic
labor
energy
incessant
activity
became
the
lot
of
this
new
american
says
a
traveler
of
the
time
of
andrew
jackson
america
is
like
a
vast
workshop
over
the
door
of
which
is
printed
in
blazing
characters
admittance
here
except
on
business
the
west
of
our
own
day
reminds
bryce
of
the
crowd
which
vathek
found
in
the
hall
of
eblis
each
darting
hither
and
thither
with
swift
steps
and
unquiet
mien
driven
to
and
fro
by
a
fire
in
the
heart
time
seems
too
short
for
what
they
have
to
do
and
the
result
always
to
come
short
of
their
desire
but
free
lands
and
the
consciousness
of
working
out
their
social
destiny
did
more
than
turn
the
westerner
to
material
interests
and
devote
him
to
a
restless
existence
they
promoted
equality
among
the
western
settlers
and
reacted
as
a
check
on
the
aristocratic
influences
of
the
east
where
everybody
could
have
a
farm
almost
for
taking
it
economic
equality
easily
resulted
and
this
involved
political
equality
not
without
a
struggle
would
the
western
man
abandon
this
ideal
and
it
goes
far
to
explain
the
unrest
in
the
remote
west
western
democracy
included
individual
liberty
as
well
as
equality
the
frontiersman
was
impatient
of
restraints
he
knew
how
to
preserve
order
even
in
the
absence
of
legal
authority
if
there
were
cattle
thieves
lynch
law
was
sudden
and
effective
the
regulators
of
the
carolinas
were
the
predecessors
of
the
claims
associations
of
iowa
and
the
vigilance
committees
of
california
but
the
individual
was
not
ready
to
submit
to
complex
regulations
population
was
sparse
there
was
no
multitude
of
jostling
interests
as
in
older
settlements
demanding
an
elaborate
system
of
personal
restraints
society
became
atomic
there
was
a
reproduction
of
the
primitive
idea
of
the
personality
of
the
law
a
crime
was
more
an
offense
against
the
victim
than
a
violation
of
the
law
of
the
land
substantial
justice
secured
in
the
most
direct
way
was
the
ideal
of
the
backwoodsman
he
had
little
patience
with
finely
drawn
distinctions
or
scruples
of
method
if
the
thing
was
one
proper
to
be
done
then
the
most
immediate
rough
and
ready
effective
way
was
the
best
way
it
followed
from
the
lack
of
organized
political
life
from
the
atomic
conditions
of
the
backwoods
society
that
the
individual
was
exalted
and
given
free
play
the
west
was
another
name
for
opportunity
here
were
mines
to
be
seized
fertile
valleys
to
be
preëmpted
all
the
natural
resources
open
to
the
shrewdest
and
the
boldest
the
united
states
is
unique
in
the
extent
to
which
the
individual
has
been
given
an
open
field
unchecked
by
restraints
of
an
old
social
order
or
of
scientific
administration
of
government
the
man
was
the
western
ideal
was
the
kind
of
man
that
all
men
might
become
out
of
his
wilderness
experience
out
of
the
freedom
of
his
opportunities
he
fashioned
a
formula
for
social
regeneration
the
freedom
of
the
individual
to
seek
his
own
he
did
not
consider
that
his
conditions
were
exceptional
and
temporary
under
such
conditions
leadership
easily
develops
a
leadership
based
on
the
possession
of
the
qualities
most
serviceable
to
the
young
society
in
the
history
of
western
settlement
we
see
each
forted
village
following
its
local
hero
clay
jackson
harrison
lincoln
were
illustrations
of
this
tendency
in
periods
when
the
western
hero
rose
to
the
dignity
of
national
hero
the
western
man
believed
in
the
manifest
destiny
of
his
country
on
his
border
and
checking
his
advance
were
the
indian
the
spaniard
and
the
englishman
he
was
indignant
at
eastern
indifference
and
lack
of
sympathy
with
his
view
of
his
relations
to
these
peoples
at
the
of
eastern
policy
the
closure
of
the
mississippi
by
spain
and
the
proposal
to
exchange
our
claim
of
freedom
of
navigating
the
river
in
return
for
commercial
advantages
to
new
england
nearly
led
to
the
withdrawal
of
the
west
from
the
union
it
was
the
western
demands
that
brought
about
the
purchase
of
louisiana
and
turned
the
scale
in
favor
of
declaring
the
war
of
militant
qualities
were
favored
by
the
annual
expansion
of
the
settled
area
in
the
face
of
hostile
indians
and
the
stubborn
wilderness
the
west
caught
the
vision
of
the
nation
continental
destiny
henry
adams
in
his
history
of
the
united
states
makes
the
american
of
exclaim
to
the
foreign
visitor
look
at
my
wealth
see
these
solid
mountains
of
salt
and
iron
of
lead
copper
silver
and
gold
see
these
magnificent
cities
scattered
broadcast
to
the
pacific
see
my
cornfields
rustling
and
waving
in
the
summer
breeze
from
ocean
to
ocean
so
far
that
the
sun
itself
is
not
high
enough
to
mark
where
the
distant
mountains
bound
my
golden
seas
look
at
this
continent
of
mine
fairest
of
created
worlds
as
she
lies
turning
up
to
the
sun
never
failing
caress
her
broad
and
exuberant
breasts
overflowing
with
milk
for
her
hundred
million
children
and
the
foreigner
saw
only
dreary
deserts
tenanted
by
sparse
pioneers
and
savages
the
cities
were
log
huts
and
gambling
dens
but
the
frontiersman
dream
was
prophetic
in
spite
of
his
rude
gross
nature
this
early
western
man
was
an
idealist
withal
he
dreamed
dreams
and
beheld
visions
he
had
faith
in
man
hope
for
democracy
belief
in
america
destiny
unbounded
confidence
in
his
ability
to
make
his
dreams
come
true
said
harriet
martineau
in
i
regard
the
american
people
as
a
great
embryo
poet
now
moody
now
wild
but
bringing
out
results
of
absolute
good
sense
restless
and
wayward
in
action
but
with
deep
peace
at
his
heart
exulting
that
he
has
caught
the
true
aspect
of
things
past
and
the
depth
of
futurity
which
lies
before
him
wherein
to
create
something
so
magnificent
as
the
world
has
scarcely
begun
to
dream
of
there
is
the
strongest
hope
of
a
nation
that
is
capable
of
being
possessed
with
an
idea
it
is
important
to
bear
this
idealism
of
the
west
in
mind
the
very
materialism
that
has
been
urged
against
the
west
was
accompanied
by
ideals
of
equality
of
the
exaltation
of
the
common
man
of
national
expansion
that
makes
it
a
profound
mistake
to
write
of
the
west
as
though
it
were
engrossed
in
mere
material
ends
it
has
been
and
is
preëminently
a
region
of
ideals
mistaken
or
not
it
is
obvious
that
these
economic
and
social
conditions
were
so
fundamental
in
western
life
that
they
might
well
dominate
whatever
accessions
came
to
the
west
by
immigration
from
the
coast
sections
or
from
europe
nevertheless
the
west
can
not
be
understood
without
bearing
in
mind
the
fact
that
it
has
received
the
great
streams
from
the
north
and
from
the
south
and
that
the
mississippi
compelled
these
currents
to
intermingle
here
it
was
that
sectionalism
first
gave
way
under
the
pressure
of
unification
ultimately
the
conflicting
ideas
and
institutions
of
the
old
sections
struggled
for
dominance
in
this
area
under
the
influence
of
the
forces
that
made
for
uniformity
but
this
is
merely
another
phase
of
the
truth
that
the
west
must
become
unified
that
it
could
not
rest
in
sectional
groupings
for
precisely
this
reason
the
struggle
occurred
in
the
period
from
the
revolution
to
the
close
of
the
war
of
the
democracy
of
the
southern
and
middle
states
contributed
the
main
streams
of
settlement
and
social
influence
to
the
west
even
in
ohio
political
power
was
soon
lost
by
the
new
england
leaders
the
democratic
spirit
of
the
middle
region
left
an
indelible
impress
on
the
west
in
this
its
formative
period
after
the
war
of
new
england
its
supremacy
in
the
carrying
trade
of
the
world
having
vanished
became
a
hive
from
which
swarms
of
settlers
went
out
to
western
new
york
and
the
remoter
regions
these
settlers
spread
new
england
ideals
of
education
and
character
and
political
institutions
and
acted
as
a
leaven
of
great
significance
in
the
northwest
but
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
believe
that
an
unmixed
new
england
influence
took
possession
of
the
northwest
these
pioneers
did
not
come
from
the
class
that
conserved
the
type
of
new
england
civilization
pure
and
undefiled
they
represented
a
less
contented
less
conservative
influence
moreover
by
their
sojourn
in
the
middle
region
on
their
westward
march
they
underwent
modification
and
when
the
farther
west
received
them
they
suffered
a
indeed
the
westernized
new
england
man
was
no
longer
the
representative
of
the
section
that
he
left
he
was
less
conservative
less
provincial
more
adaptable
and
approachable
less
rigorous
in
his
puritan
ideals
less
a
man
of
culture
more
a
man
of
action
as
might
have
been
expected
therefore
the
western
men
in
the
era
of
good
feeling
had
much
homogeneity
throughout
the
mississippi
valley
and
began
to
stand
as
a
new
national
type
under
the
lead
of
henry
clay
they
invoked
the
national
government
to
break
down
the
mountain
barrier
by
internal
improvements
and
thus
to
give
their
crops
an
outlet
to
the
coast
under
him
they
appealed
to
the
national
government
for
a
protective
tariff
to
create
a
home
market
a
group
of
frontier
states
entered
the
union
with
democratic
provisions
respecting
the
suffrage
and
with
devotion
to
the
nation
that
had
given
them
their
lands
built
their
roads
and
canals
regulated
their
territorial
life
and
made
them
equals
in
the
sisterhood
of
states
at
last
these
western
forces
of
aggressive
nationalism
and
democracy
took
possession
of
the
government
in
the
person
of
the
man
who
best
embodied
them
andrew
jackson
this
new
democracy
that
captured
the
country
and
destroyed
the
ideals
of
statesmanship
came
from
no
theorist
dreams
of
the
german
forest
it
came
stark
and
strong
and
full
of
life
from
the
american
forest
but
the
triumph
of
this
western
democracy
revealed
also
the
fact
that
it
could
rally
to
its
aid
the
laboring
classes
of
the
coast
then
just
beginning
to
acquire
and
organization
the
next
phase
of
western
development
revealed
forces
of
division
between
the
northern
and
southern
portions
of
the
west
with
the
spread
of
the
cotton
culture
went
the
slave
system
and
the
great
plantation
the
small
farmer
in
his
log
cabin
raising
varied
crops
was
displaced
by
the
planter
raising
cotton
in
all
except
the
mountainous
areas
the
industrial
organization
of
the
tidewater
took
possession
of
the
southwest
the
unity
of
the
back
country
was
broken
and
the
solid
south
was
formed
in
the
northwest
this
was
the
era
of
railroads
and
canals
opening
the
region
to
the
increasing
stream
of
middle
state
and
new
england
settlement
and
strengthening
the
opposition
to
slavery
a
map
showing
the
location
of
the
men
of
new
england
ancestry
in
the
northwest
would
represent
also
the
counties
in
which
the
free
soil
party
cast
its
heaviest
votes
the
commercial
connections
of
the
northwest
likewise
were
reversed
by
the
railroad
the
result
is
stated
by
a
writer
in
bow
in
in
these
words
what
is
new
orleans
now
where
are
her
dreams
of
greatness
and
glory
whilst
she
slept
an
enemy
has
sowed
tares
in
her
most
prolific
fields
armed
with
energy
enterprise
and
an
indomitable
spirit
that
enemy
by
a
system
of
bold
vigorous
and
sustained
efforts
has
succeeded
in
reversing
the
very
laws
of
nature
and
of
nature
god
rolled
back
the
mighty
tide
of
the
mississippi
and
its
thousand
tributary
streams
until
their
mouth
practically
and
commercially
is
more
at
new
york
or
boston
than
at
new
orleans
the
west
broke
asunder
and
the
great
struggle
over
the
social
system
to
be
given
to
the
lands
beyond
the
mississippi
followed
in
the
civil
war
the
northwest
furnished
the
national
hero
lincoln
was
the
very
flower
of
frontier
training
and
ideals
and
it
also
took
into
its
hands
the
whole
power
of
the
government
before
the
war
closed
the
west
could
claim
the
president
chief
justice
speaker
of
the
house
secretary
of
the
treasury
general
of
the
army
and
admiral
of
the
navy
the
leading
generals
of
the
war
had
been
furnished
by
the
west
it
was
the
region
of
action
and
in
the
crisis
it
took
the
reins
the
triumph
of
the
nation
was
followed
by
a
new
era
of
western
development
the
national
forces
projected
themselves
across
the
prairies
and
plains
railroads
fostered
by
government
loans
and
land
grants
opened
the
way
for
settlement
and
poured
a
flood
of
european
immigrants
and
restless
pioneers
from
all
sections
of
the
union
into
the
government
lands
the
army
of
the
united
states
pushed
back
the
indian
rectangular
territories
were
carved
into
checkerboard
states
creations
of
the
federal
government
without
a
history
without
physiographical
unity
without
particularistic
ideas
the
later
frontiersman
leaned
on
the
strong
arm
of
national
power
at
the
same
time
the
south
underwent
a
revolution
the
plantation
based
on
slavery
gave
place
to
the
farm
the
gentry
to
the
democratic
elements
as
in
the
west
new
industries
of
mining
and
of
manufacture
sprang
up
as
by
magic
the
new
south
like
the
new
west
was
an
area
of
construction
a
debtor
area
an
area
of
unrest
and
it
too
had
learned
the
uses
to
which
federal
legislation
might
be
put
in
the
meantime
the
old
northwest
passed
through
an
economic
and
social
transformation
the
whole
west
furnished
an
area
over
which
successive
waves
of
economic
development
have
passed
the
state
of
wisconsin
now
much
like
parts
of
the
state
of
new
york
was
at
an
earlier
period
like
the
state
of
nebraska
of
the
granger
movement
and
greenback
party
had
for
a
time
the
ascendancy
and
in
the
northern
counties
of
the
state
where
there
is
a
sparser
population
and
the
country
is
being
settled
its
sympathies
are
still
with
the
debtor
class
thus
the
old
northwest
is
a
region
where
the
older
frontier
conditions
survive
in
parts
and
where
the
inherited
ways
of
looking
at
things
are
largely
to
be
traced
to
its
frontier
days
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
region
in
many
ways
assimilated
to
the
east
it
understands
both
sections
it
is
not
entirely
content
with
the
existing
structure
of
economic
society
in
the
sections
where
wealth
has
accumulated
and
corporate
organizations
are
powerful
but
neither
has
it
seemed
to
feel
that
its
interests
lie
in
supporting
the
program
of
the
prairies
and
the
south
in
the
congress
it
voted
for
the
income
tax
but
it
rejected
free
coinage
it
is
still
affected
by
the
ideal
of
the
man
rather
than
by
the
ideal
of
industrial
nationalism
it
is
more
american
but
less
cosmopolitan
than
the
seaboard
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
see
clearly
some
of
the
factors
involved
in
the
western
problem
for
nearly
three
centuries
the
dominant
fact
in
american
life
has
been
expansion
with
the
settlement
of
the
pacific
coast
and
the
occupation
of
the
free
lands
this
movement
has
come
to
a
check
that
these
energies
of
expansion
will
no
longer
operate
would
be
a
rash
prediction
and
the
demands
for
a
vigorous
foreign
policy
for
an
interoceanic
canal
for
a
revival
of
our
power
upon
the
seas
and
for
the
extension
of
american
influence
to
outlying
islands
and
adjoining
countries
are
indications
that
the
movement
will
continue
the
stronghold
of
these
demands
lies
west
of
the
alleghanies
in
the
remoter
west
the
restless
rushing
wave
of
settlement
has
broken
with
a
shock
against
the
arid
plains
the
free
lands
are
gone
the
continent
is
crossed
and
all
this
push
and
energy
is
turning
into
channels
of
agitation
failures
in
one
area
can
no
longer
be
made
good
by
taking
up
land
on
a
new
frontier
the
conditions
of
a
settled
society
are
being
reached
with
suddenness
and
with
confusion
the
west
has
been
built
up
with
borrowed
capital
and
the
question
of
the
stability
of
gold
as
a
standard
of
deferred
payments
is
eagerly
agitated
by
the
debtor
west
profoundly
dissatisfied
with
the
industrial
conditions
that
confront
it
and
actuated
by
frontier
directness
and
rigor
in
its
remedies
for
the
most
part
the
men
who
built
up
the
west
beyond
the
mississippi
and
who
are
now
leading
the
agitation
came
as
pioneers
from
the
old
northwest
in
the
days
when
it
was
just
passing
from
the
stage
of
a
frontier
section
for
example
senator
allen
of
nebraska
president
of
the
recent
national
populist
convention
and
a
type
of
the
political
leaders
of
his
section
was
born
in
ohio
in
the
middle
of
the
century
went
in
his
youth
to
iowa
and
not
long
after
the
civil
war
made
his
home
in
nebraska
as
a
boy
he
saw
the
buffalo
driven
out
by
the
settlers
he
saw
the
indian
retreat
as
the
pioneer
advanced
his
training
is
that
of
the
old
west
in
its
frontier
days
and
now
the
frontier
opportunities
are
gone
discontent
is
demanding
an
extension
of
governmental
activity
in
its
behalf
in
these
demands
it
finds
itself
in
touch
with
the
depressed
agricultural
classes
and
the
workingmen
of
the
south
and
east
the
western
problem
is
no
longer
a
sectional
problem
it
is
a
social
problem
on
a
national
scale
the
greater
west
extending
from
the
alleghanies
to
the
pacific
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
unit
it
requires
analysis
into
regions
and
classes
but
its
area
its
population
and
its
material
resources
would
give
force
to
its
assertion
that
if
there
is
a
sectionalism
in
the
country
the
sectionalism
is
eastern
the
old
west
united
to
the
new
south
would
produce
not
a
new
sectionalism
but
a
new
americanism
it
would
not
mean
sectional
disunion
as
some
have
speculated
but
it
might
mean
a
drastic
assertion
of
national
government
and
imperial
expansion
under
a
popular
hero
this
then
is
the
real
situation
a
people
composed
of
heterogeneous
materials
with
diverse
and
conflicting
ideals
and
social
interests
having
passed
from
the
task
of
filling
up
the
vacant
spaces
of
the
continent
is
now
thrown
back
upon
itself
and
is
seeking
an
equilibrium
the
diverse
elements
are
being
fused
into
national
unity
the
forces
of
reorganization
are
turbulent
and
the
nation
seems
like
a
witches
kettle
but
the
west
has
its
own
centers
of
industrial
life
and
culture
not
unlike
those
of
the
east
it
has
state
universities
rivaling
in
conservative
and
scientific
economic
instruction
those
of
any
other
part
of
the
union
and
its
citizens
more
often
visit
the
east
than
do
eastern
men
the
west
as
time
goes
on
its
industrial
development
will
bring
it
more
into
harmony
with
the
east
moreover
the
old
northwest
holds
the
balance
of
power
and
is
the
battlefield
on
which
these
issues
of
american
development
are
to
be
settled
it
has
more
in
common
with
all
parts
of
the
nation
than
has
any
other
region
it
understands
the
east
as
the
east
does
not
understand
the
west
the
white
city
which
recently
rose
on
the
shores
of
lake
michigan
fitly
typified
its
growing
culture
as
well
as
its
capacity
for
great
achievement
its
complex
and
representative
industrial
organization
and
business
ties
its
determination
to
hold
fast
to
what
is
original
and
good
in
its
western
experience
and
its
readiness
to
learn
and
receive
the
results
of
the
experience
of
other
sections
and
nations
make
it
an
and
safe
arbiter
of
the
american
destiny
in
the
long
run
the
center
of
the
republic
may
be
trusted
to
strike
a
wise
balance
between
the
contending
ideals
but
she
does
not
deceive
herself
she
knows
that
the
problem
of
the
west
means
nothing
less
than
the

the

is
a
name
which
tells
of
the
vestiges
which
the

the

has
left
behind
it
the

upon

the
old

the
historic
northwest
territory
is
now
the
new
middle
region
of
the
united
states
a
century
ago
it
was
a
wilderness
broken
only
by
a
few
french
settlements
and
the
straggling
american
hamlets
along
the
ohio
and
its
tributaries
while
on
the
shore
of
lake
erie
moses
cleaveland
had
just
led
a
handful
of
men
to
the
connecticut
reserve
it
is
the
keystone
of
the
american
commonwealth
since
the
center
of
population
of
the
united
states
has
rested
within
its
limits
and
the
center
of
manufacturing
in
the
nation
lies
eight
miles
from
president
mckinley
ohio
home
of
the
seven
men
who
have
been
elected
to
the
presidency
of
the

since
six
have
come
from
the
old
northwest
and
the
seventh
came
from
the
kindred
region
of
western
new
york
the
congressional
representatives
from
these
five
states
of
the
old
northwest
already
outnumber
those
from
the
old
middle
states
and
are
three
times
as
numerous
as
those
from
new
england
the
elements
that
have
contributed
to
the
civilization
of
this
region
are
therefore
well
worth
consideration
to
know
the
states
that
make
up
the
old
northwest
ohio
indiana
illinois
michigan
and
wisconsin
one
must
understand
their
social
origins
eldest
in
this
sisterhood
was
ohio
new
england
gave
the
formative
impulses
to
this
state
by
the
part
which
the
ohio
company
played
in
securing
the
ordinance
of
and
at
marietta
and
cleveland
massachusetts
and
connecticut
planted
enduring
centers
of
puritan
influence
during
the
same
period
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
sent
their
colonists
to
the
symmes
purchase
in
which
cincinnati
was
the
while
virginians
sought
the
military
bounty
lands
in
the
region
of
chillicothe
the
middle
states
and
the
south
with
their
democratic
ideas
constituted
the
dominant
element
in
ohio
politics
in
the
early
part
of
her
history
this
dominance
is
shown
by
the
nativity
of
the
members
of
the
ohio
legislature
elected
in
new
england
furnished
nine
senators
and
sixteen
representatives
chiefly
from
connecticut
new
york
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
seventeen
senators
and
representatives
mostly
from
pennsylvania
while
the
south
furnished
nine
senators
and
representatives
of
whom
the
majority
came
from
virginia
five
of
the
representatives
were
native
of
ireland
presumably
in
the
ohio
senate
therefore
the
middle
states
had
as
many
representatives
as
had
new
england
and
the
south
together
while
the
southern
men
slightly
outnumbered
the
middle
states
men
in
the
assembly
together
the
emigrants
from
the
democratic
south
and
middle
region
outnumbered
the
federalist
new
englanders
three
to
one
although
ohio
is
popularly
considered
a
child
of
new
england
it
is
clear
that
in
these
formative
years
of
her
statehood
the
commonwealth
was
dominated
by
other
forces
by
the
close
of
this
early
period
in
the
settlement
in
ohio
had
covered
more
or
less
fully
all
except
the
northwest
corner
of
the
state
and
indiana
formative
period
was
well
started
here
as
in
ohio
there
was
a
large
southern
element
but
while
the
southern
stream
that
flowed
into
ohio
had
its
sources
in
virginia
the
main
current
that
sought
indiana
came
from
north
carolina
and
these
settlers
were
for
the
most
part
from
the
humbler
classes
in
the
settlement
of
indiana
from
the
south
two
separate
elements
are
distinguishable
the
quaker
migration
from
north
carolina
moving
chiefly
because
of
convictions
the
poor
white
stream
made
up
in
part
of
restless
hunters
and
thriftless
pioneers
moving
without
definite
ambitions
and
in
part
of
other
classes
such
as
former
overseers
migrating
to
the
new
country
with
definite
purpose
of
improving
their
fortunes
these
elements
constituted
features
in
the
southern
contribution
to
indiana
and
they
explain
why
she
has
been
named
the
hoosier
state
but
it
should
by
no
means
be
thought
that
all
of
the
southern
immigrants
came
under
these
classes
nor
that
these
have
been
the
normal
elements
in
the
development
of
the
indiana
of
in
the
northwest
where
interstate
migration
has
been
so
continuous
and
widespread
the
lack
of
typical
state
peculiarities
is
obvious
and
the
student
of
society
like
the
traveler
is
tempted
in
his
effort
to
distinguish
the
community
from
its
neighbors
to
exaggerate
the
odd
and
exceptional
elements
which
give
a
particular
flavor
to
the
state
indiana
has
suffered
somewhat
from
this
tendency
but
it
is
undoubted
that
these
peculiarities
of
origin
left
deep
and
abiding
influences
upon
the
state
in
her
settlement
was
chiefly
in
the
southern
counties
where
southern
and
middle
states
influence
was
dominant
her
two
united
states
senators
were
virginians
by
birth
while
her
representative
was
from
pennsylvania
the
southern
element
continued
so
powerful
that
one
student
of
indiana
origins
has
estimated
that
in
of
the
population
of
the
state
were
native
carolinians
and
their
children
in
the
first
generation
not
until
a
few
years
before
the
civil
war
did
the
northern
current
exert
a
decisive
influence
upon
indiana
she
had
no
such
lake
ports
as
had
her
sister
states
and
extension
of
settlement
into
the
state
from
ports
like
chicago
was
interrupted
by
the
less
attractive
area
of
the
northwestern
part
of
indiana
add
to
this
the
geological
fact
that
the
limestone
ridges
and
the
best
soils
ran
in
nearly
perpendicular
belts
northward
from
the
ohio
and
it
will
be
seen
how
circumstances
combined
to
diminish
northern
and
to
facilitate
southern
influences
in
the
state
prior
to
the
railroad
development
in
illinois
also
the
current
of
migration
was
at
first
preponderantly
southern
but
the
settlers
were
less
often
from
the
atlantic
coast
kentucky
and
tennessee
were
generous
contributors
but
many
of
the
distinguished
leaders
came
from
virginia
and
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
in
the
two
united
states
senators
of
illinois
were
of
maryland
ancestry
while
her
representative
was
of
kentucky
origin
the
swarms
of
between
and
ascended
the
illinois
river
and
spread
out
between
that
river
and
the
mississippi
it
was
in
this
period
that
abraham
lincoln
father
who
had
come
from
kentucky
to
indiana
again
left
his
log
cabin
and
traveled
by
with
his
family
to
the
popular
illinois
county
of
sangamon
here
lincoln
split
his
famous
rails
to
fence
their
land
and
grew
up
under
the
influences
of
this
migration
of
the
southern
pioneers
to
the
prairies
they
were
not
predominantly
of
the
planter
class
but
the
fierce
contest
in
over
the
proposition
to
open
illinois
to
slavery
was
won
for
freedom
by
a
narrow
majority
looking
at
the
three
states
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
prior
to
we
perceive
how
important
was
the
voice
of
the
south
here
and
we
can
the
more
easily
understand
the
early
affiliation
of
the
northwest
with
her
sister
states
to
the
south
on
the
western
waters
it
was
not
without
reason
that
the
proposal
of
the
missouri
compromise
came
from
illinois
and
it
was
a
natural
enthusiasm
with
which
these
states
followed
henry
clay
in
the
war
policy
of
the
combination
of
the
south
the
western
portion
of
the
middle
states
and
the
mississippi
valley
gave
the
ascendancy
to
the
democratic
ideals
of
the
followers
of
jefferson
and
left
new
england
a
weakened
and
isolated
section
for
nearly
half
a
century
many
of
the
most
characteristic
elements
in
american
life
in
the
first
part
of
the
century
were
due
to
this
relationship
between
the
south
and
the
region
but
even
thus
early
the
northwest
had
revealed
strong
predilections
for
the
northern
economic
ideals
as
against
the
peculiar
institution
of
the
south
and
this
tendency
grew
with
the
increase
of
new
england
immigration
the
northern
two
in
this
sisterhood
of
northwestern
states
were
the
first
to
be
entered
by
the
french
but
latest
by
the
english
settlers
why
michigan
was
not
occupied
by
new
york
men
at
an
earlier
period
is
at
first
sight
not
easy
to
understand
perhaps
the
adverse
reports
of
surveyors
who
visited
the
interior
of
the
state
the
partial
geographical
isolation
and
the
unprogressive
character
of
the
french
settlers
account
for
the
tardy
occupation
of
the
area
certain
it
is
that
while
the
southern
tier
of
states
was
sought
by
swarms
of
settlers
wisconsin
and
michigan
still
echoed
to
canadian
and
voyageurs
paddled
their
birch
canoes
along
the
streams
of
the
wilderness
to
traffic
with
the
savages
great
britain
maintained
the
dominant
position
until
after
the
war
of
and
the
real
center
of
authority
was
in
canada
but
after
the
digging
of
the
erie
canal
settlement
began
to
turn
into
michigan
between
and
the
population
of
the
state
leaped
from
to
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
the
heavy
debt
of
the
state
and
the
crisis
of
turned
from
her
borders
many
of
the
thrifty
germans
the
vast
majority
of
the
settlers
were
new
yorkers
michigan
is
distinctly
a
child
of
the
empire
state
canadians
both
french
and
english
continued
to
come
as
the
lumber
interests
of
the
region
increased
by
michigan
contained
nearly
inhabitants
who
occupied
the
southern
half
of
the
state
but
she
now
found
an
active
competitor
for
settlement
in
wisconsin
in
this
region
two
forces
had
attracted
the
earlier
inhabitants
the
posts
of
green
bay
prairie
du
chien
and
milwaukee
constituted
one
element
in
which
the
french
influence
was
continued
the
lead
region
of
the
southwest
corner
of
the
state
formed
the
center
of
attraction
for
illinois
and
southern
pioneers
the
soldiers
who
followed
black
hawk
trail
in
reported
the
richness
of
the
soil
and
an
era
of
immigration
followed
to
the
port
of
milwaukee
came
a
combined
migration
from
western
new
york
and
new
england
and
spread
along
the
southern
tier
of
prairie
counties
until
it
met
the
southern
settlers
in
the
lead
region
many
of
the
early
political
contests
in
the
state
were
connected
as
in
ohio
and
illinois
with
the
antagonisms
between
the
sections
thus
brought
together
in
a
limited
area
the
other
element
in
the
formation
of
wisconsin
was
that
of
the
germans
then
just
entering
upon
their
vast
immigration
to
the
united
states
wisconsin
was
free
from
debt
she
made
a
constitution
of
exceptional
liberality
to
foreigners
and
instead
of
treasuring
her
school
lands
or
using
them
for
internal
improvements
she
sold
them
for
almost
nothing
to
attract
immigration
the
result
was
that
the
prudent
germans
who
loved
light
taxes
and
cheap
hard
wood
lands
turned
toward
wisconsin
another
from
milwaukee
as
a
center
they
spread
north
along
the
shore
of
lake
michigan
and
later
into
northern
central
wisconsin
following
the
belt
of
the
hardwood
forests
so
considerable
were
their
numbers
that
such
an
economist
as
roscher
wrote
of
the
feasibility
of
making
wisconsin
a
german
state
they
can
plant
the
vine
on
the
hills
cried
franz
löher
in
and
drink
with
happy
song
and
dance
they
can
have
german
schools
and
universities
german
literature
and
art
german
science
and
philosophy
german
courts
and
assemblies
in
short
they
can
form
a
german
state
in
which
the
german
language
shall
be
as
much
the
popular
and
official
language
as
the
english
is
now
and
in
which
the
german
spirit
shall
rule
by
the
were
sixteen
per
cent
of
the
population
of
the
state
but
the
new
york
and
new
england
stream
proved
even
more
broad
and
steady
in
its
flow
in
these
years
before
the
war
wisconsin
population
rose
from
in
to
in
the
new
england
element
that
entered
this
state
is
probably
typical
of
the
same
element
in
wisconsin
neighboring
states
and
demands
notice
it
came
for
the
most
part
not
from
the
seaboard
of
massachusetts
which
has
so
frequently
represented
new
england
to
the
popular
apprehension
a
large
element
in
this
stock
was
the
product
of
the
migration
that
ascended
the
valleys
of
connecticut
and
central
massachusetts
through
the
hills
into
vermont
and
new
york
a
pioneer
folk
almost
from
the
time
of
their
origin
the
vermont
colonists
decidedly
outnumbered
those
of
massachusetts
in
both
michigan
and
wisconsin
and
were
far
more
numerous
in
other
northwestern
states
than
the
population
of
vermont
warranted
together
with
this
current
came
the
settlers
from
western
new
york
these
were
generally
descendants
of
this
same
pioneer
new
england
stock
continuing
into
a
remoter
west
the
movement
that
had
brought
their
parents
to
new
york
the
combined
current
from
new
england
and
new
york
thus
constituted
a
distinctly
modified
new
england
stock
and
was
clearly
the
dominant
native
element
in
michigan
and
wisconsin
the
decade
of
the
forties
was
also
the
period
of
iowa
rapid
increase
although
not
politically
a
part
of
the
old
northwest
in
history
she
is
closely
related
to
that
region
her
growth
was
by
no
means
so
rapid
as
was
wisconsin
for
the
proportion
of
foreign
immigration
was
less
whereas
in
more
than
of
wisconsin
population
was
the
proportion
for
iowa
was
not
much
over
the
main
body
of
her
people
finally
came
from
the
middle
states
and
illinois
and
ohio
but
southern
elements
were
well
represented
particularly
among
her
political
leaders
the
middle
of
the
century
was
the
in
the
transfer
of
control
in
the
northwest
below
the
line
of
the
old
national
turnpike
marked
by
the
cities
of
columbus
indianapolis
vandalia
and
louis
the
counties
had
acquired
a
stability
of
settlement
and
partly
because
of
the
southern
element
partly
because
of
a
natural
tendency
of
new
communities
toward
jacksonian
ideals
these
counties
were
preponderantly
democratic
but
the
southern
migration
had
turned
to
the
cotton
areas
of
the
southwest
and
the
development
of
railroads
and
canals
had
broken
the
historic
commercial
ascendancy
of
the
mississippi
river
new
orleans
was
yielding
the
scepter
to
new
york
the
tide
of
migration
from
the
north
poured
along
these
newly
opened
channels
and
occupied
the
less
settled
counties
above
the
national
turnpike
in
cities
like
columbus
and
indianapolis
where
the
two
currents
had
run
side
by
side
the
combined
elements
were
most
clearly
marked
but
in
the
northwest
as
a
whole
a
varied
population
had
been
formed
this
region
seemed
to
represent
and
understand
the
various
parts
of
the
union
it
was
this
aspect
which
vinton
of
ohio
urged
in
congress
when
he
made
his
notable
speech
in
favor
of
the
admission
of
iowa
he
pleaded
the
mission
of
the
northwest
as
the
mediator
between
the
sections
and
the
unifying
agency
in
the
nation
with
such
power
and
pathos
as
to
thrill
even
john
quincy
adams
but
there
are
some
issues
which
can
not
be
settled
by
compromise
tendencies
one
of
which
must
conquer
the
other
such
an
issue
the
slave
power
raised
and
raised
too
late
for
support
in
the
upper
half
of
the
mississippi
basin
the
northern
and
the
southern
elements
found
themselves
in
opposition
to
each
other
a
house
divided
against
itself
can
not
stand
said
abraham
lincoln
a
northern
leader
of
southern
origin
douglas
a
leader
of
the
southern
forces
though
coming
from
new
england
declared
his
indifference
whether
slavery
were
voted
up
or
down
in
the
western
territories
the
historic
debates
between
these
two
champions
reveal
the
complex
conditions
in
the
northwest
and
take
on
a
new
meaning
when
considered
in
the
light
of
this
contest
between
the
northern
and
the
southern
elements
the
state
that
had
been
so
potent
for
compromise
was
at
last
the
itself
and
the
places
selected
for
the
various
debates
of
lincoln
and
douglas
marked
the
strongholds
and
the
outposts
of
the
antagonistic
forces
at
this
time
the
kinship
of
western
new
york
and
the
dominant
element
in
the
northwest
was
clearly
revealed
speaking
for
the
forces
at
madison
wisconsin
in
seward
said
the
northwest
is
by
no
means
so
small
as
you
may
think
it
i
speak
to
you
because
i
feel
that
i
am
and
during
all
my
mature
life
have
been
one
of
you
although
of
new
york
i
am
still
a
citizen
of
the
northwest
the
northwest
extends
eastward
to
the
base
of
the
alleghany
mountains
and
does
not
all
of
western
new
york
lie
westward
of
the
alleghany
mountains
whence
comes
all
the
inspiration
of
free
soil
which
spreads
itself
with
such
cheerful
voices
over
all
these
plains
why
from
new
york
westward
of
the
alleghany
mountains
the
people
before
me
who
are
you
but
new
york
men
while
you
are
men
of
the
northwest
in
the
civil
war
western
new
york
and
the
northwest
were
powerful
in
the
forum
and
in
the
field
a
million
soldiers
came
from
the
states
that
the
ordinance
passed
by
southern
votes
had
devoted
to
freedom
this
was
the
first
grave
time
of
trial
for
the
northwest
and
it
did
much
eventually
to
give
to
the
region
a
homogeneity
and
but
at
the
close
of
the
war
the
region
was
still
agricultural
only
still
breaking
ground
in
northern
forests
still
receiving
contributions
of
peoples
which
radically
modified
the
social
organism
and
undergoing
economic
changes
almost
revolutionary
in
their
rapidity
and
extent
the
changes
since
the
war
are
of
more
social
importance
in
many
respects
than
those
in
the
years
commonly
referred
to
as
the
formative
period
as
a
result
the
northwest
finds
herself
again
between
contending
forces
sharing
the
interests
of
east
and
west
as
once
before
those
of
north
and
south
and
forced
to
give
her
voice
on
issues
of
equal
significance
for
the
destiny
of
the
republic
in
these
transforming
years
since
ohio
finding
the
talisman
that
revealed
the
treasury
of
mineral
wealth
gas
and
petroleum
beneath
her
fields
has
leaped
to
a
front
rank
among
the
manufacturing
states
of
the
union
potential
on
the
great
lakes
by
reason
of
her
ports
of
toledo
and
cleveland
tapping
the
ohio
river
artery
of
trade
at
cincinnati
and
closely
connected
with
all
the
vast
material
development
of
the
upper
waters
of
this
river
in
western
pennsylvania
and
west
virginia
ohio
has
become
distinctly
a
part
of
the
eastern
social
organism
much
like
the
state
of
pennsylvania
the
complexity
of
her
origin
still
persists
ohio
has
no
preponderant
social
center
her
multiplicity
of
colleges
and
universities
bears
tribute
to
the
diversity
of
the
elements
that
have
made
the
state
of
her
people
are
of
foreign
parentage
one
or
both
parents
and
the
city
of
cincinnati
has
been
deeply
affected
by
the
german
stock
while
cleveland
strongly
reflects
the
influence
of
the
new
england
element
that
influence
is
still
very
palpable
but
it
is
new
england
in
the
presence
of
natural
gas
iron
and
coal
new
england
shaped
by
blast
and
forge
the
middle
state
ideals
will
dominate
ohio
future
bucolic
indiana
too
within
the
last
decade
has
come
into
the
possession
of
and
has
increased
the
exploitation
of
her
coals
until
she
seems
destined
to
share
in
the
industrial
type
represented
by
ohio
cities
have
arisen
like
a
dream
on
the
sites
of
country
villages
but
indiana
has
a
much
smaller
proportion
of
foreign
elements
than
any
other
state
of
the
old
northwest
and
it
is
the
southern
element
that
still
differentiates
her
from
her
sisters
while
political
leaders
still
attest
the
puritan
migration
indiana
clasp
hands
with
the
leaders
from
the
south
the
southern
elements
continue
also
to
reveal
themselves
in
the
democratic
southwestern
counties
of
illinois
grouped
like
a
broad
delta
of
the
illinois
river
while
northern
illinois
holds
a
larger
proportion
of
descendants
of
the
middle
states
and
new
england
about
her
population
is
of
foreign
parentage
in
which
the
german
irish
and
scandinavians
furnish
the
largest
elements
she
is
a
great
agricultural
state
and
a
great
manufacturing
state
the
connecting
link
between
the
mississippi
and
the
great
lakes
her
metropolis
chicago
is
the
very
type
of
northwestern
development
for
good
and
for
evil
it
is
an
epitome
of
her
composite
nationality
a
recent
writer
analyzing
the
school
census
of
chicago
points
out
that
only
two
cities
in
the
german
empire
berlin
and
hamburg
have
a
greater
german
population
than
chicago
only
two
in
sweden
stockholm
and
göteborg
have
more
swedes
and
only
two
in
norway
christiana
and
bergen
have
more
norwegians
while
the
irish
polish
bohemians
and
dutch
elements
are
also
largely
represented
but
in
spite
of
her
rapidity
of
growth
and
her
complex
elements
chicago
stands
as
the
representative
of
the
and
genius
for
action
of
the
middle
west
and
the
state
of
illinois
will
be
the
for
social
and
economic
ideals
for
the
next
generation
michigan
is
two
states
the
northern
peninsula
is
cut
off
from
the
southern
physically
industrially
and
in
the
history
of
settlement
it
would
seem
that
her
natural
destiny
was
with
wisconsin
or
some
possible
new
state
embracing
the
iron
and
copper
forest
and
shipping
areas
of
michigan
wisconsin
and
minnesota
on
lake
superior
the
lower
peninsula
of
michigan
is
the
daughter
of
new
york
and
over
twelve
per
cent
of
michigan
present
population
were
born
in
that
state
and
her
traits
are
those
of
the
parent
state
over
half
her
population
is
of
foreign
parentage
of
which
canada
and
england
together
have
furnished
while
the
germans
outnumber
any
other
single
foreign
element
the
state
has
undergone
a
steady
industrial
development
exploiting
her
northern
mines
and
forests
developing
her
lumber
interests
with
saginaw
as
the
center
raising
fruits
along
the
lake
shore
counties
and
producing
grain
in
the
middle
trough
of
counties
running
from
saginaw
bay
to
the
south
of
lake
michigan
her
state
university
has
been
her
peculiar
glory
furnishing
the
first
model
for
the
state
university
and
it
is
the
educational
contribution
of
the
northwest
to
the
nation
wisconsin
future
is
dependent
upon
the
influence
of
the
large
proportion
of
her
population
of
foreign
parentage
for
nearly
of
her
inhabitants
are
of
that
class
she
thus
has
a
smaller
percentage
of
native
population
than
any
other
of
the
states
formed
from
the
old
northwest
of
this
foreign
element
the
germans
constitute
by
far
the
largest
part
with
the
scandinavians
second
her
american
population
born
outside
of
wisconsin
comes
chiefly
from
new
york
in
contrast
with
the
ohio
river
states
she
lacks
the
southern
element
her
greater
foreign
population
and
her
dairy
interests
contrast
with
michigan
canadian
and
english
elements
and
fruit
culture
her
relations
are
more
western
than
michigan
by
reason
of
her
connection
with
the
mississippi
and
the
prairie
states
her
foreign
element
is
slightly
less
than
minnesota
and
in
the
latter
state
the
scandinavians
take
the
place
held
by
the
germans
in
wisconsin
the
facility
with
which
the
scandinavians
catch
the
spirit
of
western
america
and
assimilate
with
their
neighbors
is
much
greater
than
is
the
case
with
the
germans
so
that
wisconsin
seems
to
offer
opportunity
for
influence
in
a
greater
degree
than
her
sister
on
the
west
while
minnesota
economic
development
has
heretofore
been
closely
dependent
on
the
prairies
the
opening
of
the
iron
fields
of
the
mesabi
and
vermilion
ranges
together
with
the
development
of
paul
and
minneapolis
duluth
and
west
superior
and
the
prospective
achievement
of
a
communication
with
the
atlantic
seem
to
offer
to
that
state
a
new
and
imperial
industrial
destiny
between
this
stupendous
economic
future
to
the
northwest
and
the
colossal
growth
of
chicago
on
the
southeast
wisconsin
seems
likely
to
become
a
middle
agricultural
area
developing
particularly
into
a
dairy
state
she
is
powerfully
affected
by
the
conservative
tendencies
of
her
german
element
in
times
of
political
agitation
and
of
proposals
of
social
change
some
of
the
social
modifications
in
this
state
are
more
or
less
typical
of
important
processes
at
work
among
the
neighboring
states
of
the
old
northwest
in
the
north
the
men
who
built
up
the
lumber
interests
of
the
state
who
founded
a
mill
town
surrounded
by
the
stumps
of
the
pine
forests
which
they
exploited
for
the
prairie
markets
have
acquired
wealth
and
political
power
the
spacious
and
home
of
the
may
now
be
seen
in
many
a
northern
community
in
a
group
of
less
pretentious
homes
of
operatives
and
tradesmen
the
social
distinctions
between
them
emphasized
by
the
difference
in
nationality
a
few
years
before
this
captain
of
industry
was
perhaps
actively
engaged
in
the
task
of
seeking
the
best
forties
or
directing
the
operations
of
his
his
wife
and
daughters
make
extensive
visits
to
europe
his
sons
go
to
some
university
and
he
himself
is
likely
to
acquire
political
position
or
to
devote
his
energies
to
saving
the
town
from
industrial
decline
as
the
timber
is
cut
away
by
transforming
it
into
a
manufacturing
center
for
more
finished
products
still
others
continue
their
activity
among
the
forests
of
the
south
this
social
history
of
the
timber
areas
of
wisconsin
has
left
clear
indications
in
the
development
of
the
peculiar
political
leadership
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
state
in
the
southern
and
middle
counties
of
the
state
the
original
settlement
of
the
native
american
pioneer
farmer
a
tendency
is
showing
itself
to
divide
the
farms
and
to
sell
to
thrifty
germans
or
to
cultivate
the
soil
by
tenants
while
the
farmer
retires
to
live
in
the
neighboring
village
and
perhaps
to
organize
creameries
and
develop
a
dairy
business
the
result
is
that
a
replacement
of
nationalities
is
in
progress
townships
and
even
counties
once
dominated
by
the
native
american
farmers
of
new
york
extraction
are
now
possessed
by
germans
or
other
european
nationalities
large
portions
of
the
retail
trades
of
the
towns
are
also
passing
into
german
hands
while
the
native
element
seeks
the
cities
the
professions
or
mercantile
enterprises
of
larger
character
the
element
shows
distinct
tendencies
to
dwell
in
groups
one
of
the
most
striking
illustrations
of
this
fact
is
the
community
of
new
glarus
in
wisconsin
formed
by
a
carefully
organized
migration
from
glarus
in
switzerland
aided
by
the
canton
itself
for
some
years
this
community
was
a
miniature
swiss
canton
in
social
organization
and
customs
but
of
late
it
has
become
increasingly
assimilated
to
the
american
type
and
has
left
an
impress
by
transforming
the
county
in
which
it
is
from
a
to
a
dairy
region
from
milwaukee
as
a
center
the
influence
of
the
germans
upon
the
social
customs
and
ideals
of
wisconsin
has
been
marked
milwaukee
has
many
of
the
aspects
of
a
german
city
and
has
furnished
a
stronghold
of
resistance
to
native
american
efforts
to
enact
rigid
temperance
legislation
laws
regulative
of
parochial
schools
and
similar
attempts
to
bend
the
german
type
to
the
social
ideas
of
the
pioneer
american
stock
in
the
last
presidential
election
the
german
area
of
the
state
deserted
the
democratic
party
and
its
opposition
to
free
silver
was
a
decisive
factor
in
the
overwhelming
victory
of
the
republicans
in
wisconsin
with
all
the
evidence
of
the
persistence
of
the
influence
of
this
nationality
it
is
nevertheless
clear
that
each
decade
marks
an
increased
assimilation
and
homogeneity
in
the
state
but
the
result
is
a
compromise
and
not
a
conquest
by
either
element
the
states
of
the
old
northwest
gave
to
mckinley
a
plurality
of
over
out
of
a
total
vote
of
about
new
england
and
the
middle
states
together
gave
him
a
plurality
of
in
about
the
same
vote
while
the
farther
west
gave
to
bryan
a
decisive
net
plurality
it
thus
appears
that
the
old
northwest
occupied
the
position
of
a
political
middle
region
between
east
and
west
the
significance
of
this
position
is
manifest
when
it
is
recalled
that
this
section
is
the
child
of
the
east
and
the
mother
of
the
populistic
west
the
occupation
of
the
western
prairies
was
determined
by
forces
similar
to
those
which
settled
the
old
northwest
in
the
decade
before
the
war
minnesota
succeeded
to
the
place
held
by
wisconsin
as
the
mecca
of
settlers
in
the
prior
decade
to
wisconsin
and
new
york
she
owes
the
largest
proportion
of
her
native
settlers
born
outside
of
the
state
kansas
and
nebraska
were
settled
most
rapidly
in
the
decade
following
the
war
and
had
a
large
proportion
of
soldiers
in
their
american
immigrants
illinois
and
ohio
together
furnished
about
of
the
native
settlers
of
these
states
but
the
element
coming
from
southern
states
was
stronger
in
kansas
than
in
nebraska
both
these
states
have
an
exceptionally
large
proportion
of
native
whites
as
compared
with
their
neighbors
among
the
prairie
states
kansas
for
example
has
about
per
cent
of
persons
of
foreign
parentage
while
nebraska
has
about
iowa
south
dakota
sixty
wisconsin
minnesota
and
north
dakota
north
dakota
development
was
greatest
in
the
decade
prior
to
her
native
stock
came
in
largest
numbers
from
wisconsin
with
new
york
minnesota
and
iowa
next
in
order
the
growth
of
south
dakota
occupied
the
two
decades
prior
to
the
census
of
and
she
has
recruited
her
native
element
from
wisconsin
iowa
illinois
and
new
york
in
consequence
of
the
large
migration
from
the
states
of
the
old
northwest
to
the
virgin
soils
of
these
prairie
states
many
counties
in
the
parent
states
show
a
considerable
decline
in
growth
in
the
decade
before
there
is
significance
in
the
fact
that
with
the
exception
of
iowa
these
prairie
states
the
colonies
of
the
old
northwest
gave
bryan
votes
in
the
election
of
in
the
ratio
of
their
proportion
of
persons
of
native
parentage
north
dakota
with
the
heaviest
foreign
element
was
carried
for
mckinley
while
south
dakota
with
a
much
smaller
foreign
vote
went
for
bryan
kansas
and
nebraska
rank
with
ohio
in
their
native
percentage
and
they
were
the
center
of
prairie
populism
of
course
there
were
other
important
local
economic
and
political
explanations
for
this
ratio
but
it
seems
to
have
a
basis
of
real
meaning
certain
it
is
that
the
leaders
of
the
silver
movement
came
from
the
native
element
furnished
by
the
old
northwest
the
original
populists
in
the
kansas
legislature
of
were
born
in
different
states
as
follows
in
ohio
twelve
indiana
six
illinois
five
new
york
four
pennsylvania
two
connecticut
vermont
and
maine
one
each
making
a
total
for
the
northern
current
of
of
the
remaining
eighteen
thirteen
were
from
the
south
and
one
each
from
kansas
missouri
california
england
and
ireland
nearly
all
were
methodists
and
former
republicans
looking
at
the
silver
movement
more
largely
we
find
that
of
the
kansas
delegation
in
the
congress
one
was
born
in
kansas
and
the
rest
in
indiana
illinois
ohio
pennsylvania
west
virginia
and
maine
all
of
the
nebraska
delegation
in
the
house
came
from
the
old
northwest
or
from
iowa
the
biographies
of
the
two
representatives
from
the
state
of
washington
tell
an
interesting
story
these
men
came
as
children
to
the
pine
woods
of
wisconsin
took
up
public
lands
and
worked
on
the
farm
and
in
the
pineries
one
passed
on
to
a
homestead
in
nebraska
before
settling
in
washington
thus
they
kept
one
stage
ahead
of
the
social
transformations
of
the
west
this
is
the
usual
training
of
the
western
politicians
if
the
reader
would
see
a
picture
of
the
representative
kansas
populist
let
him
examine
the
family
portraits
of
the
ohio
farmer
in
the
middle
of
this
century
in
a
word
the
populist
is
the
american
farmer
who
has
kept
in
advance
of
the
economic
and
social
transformations
that
have
overtaken
those
who
remained
behind
while
doubtless
investigation
into
the
ancestry
of
the
populists
and
silver
men
who
came
to
the
prairies
from
the
old
northwest
would
show
a
large
proportion
of
southern
origin
yet
the
center
of
discontent
seems
to
have
been
among
the
men
of
the
new
england
and
new
york
current
if
new
england
looks
with
care
at
these
men
she
may
recognize
in
them
the
familiar
lineaments
of
the
embattled
farmers
who
fired
the
shot
heard
round
the
world
the
continuous
advance
of
this
pioneer
stock
from
new
england
has
preserved
for
us
the
older
type
of
the
pioneer
of
frontier
new
england
i
do
not
overlook
the
transforming
influences
of
the
wilderness
on
this
stock
ever
since
it
left
the
earlier
frontier
to
follow
up
the
valleys
of
western
connecticut
massachusetts
and
vermont
into
western
new
york
into
ohio
into
iowa
and
out
to
the
arid
plains
of
western
kansas
and
nebraska
nor
do
i
overlook
the
peculiar
industrial
conditions
of
the
prairie
states
but
i
desire
to
insist
upon
the
other
truth
also
that
these
westward
immigrants
keeping
for
generations
in
advance
of
the
transforming
industrial
and
social
forces
that
have
wrought
so
vast
a
revolution
in
the
older
regions
of
the
east
which
they
left
could
not
but
preserve
important
aspects
of
the
older
farmer
type
in
the
arid
west
these
pioneers
have
halted
and
have
turned
to
perceive
an
altered
nation
and
changed
social
ideals
they
see
the
sharp
contrast
between
their
traditional
idea
of
america
as
the
land
of
opportunity
the
land
of
the
man
free
from
class
distinctions
and
from
the
power
of
wealth
and
the
existing
america
so
unlike
the
earlier
ideal
if
we
follow
back
the
line
of
march
of
the
puritan
farmer
we
shall
see
how
responsive
he
has
always
been
to
and
how
persistently
he
has
resisted
encroachments
on
his
ideals
of
individual
opportunity
and
democracy
he
is
the
prophet
of
the
higher
law
in
kansas
before
the
civil
war
he
is
the
prohibitionist
of
iowa
and
wisconsin
crying
out
against
german
customs
as
an
invasion
of
his
traditional
ideals
he
is
the
granger
of
wisconsin
passing
restrictive
railroad
legislation
he
is
the
abolitionist
the
the
millerite
the
woman
suffragist
the
spiritualist
the
mormon
of
western
new
york
follow
him
to
his
new
england
home
in
the
turbulent
days
of
shays
rebellion
paper
money
stay
and
tender
laws
and
land
banks
the
radicals
among
these
new
england
farmers
hated
lawyers
and
capitalists
i
would
not
trust
them
said
abraham
white
in
the
ratification
convention
of
massachusetts
in
though
every
one
of
them
should
be
a
moses
these
lawyers
cried
amos
singletary
and
men
of
learning
and
moneyed
men
that
talk
so
finely
and
gloss
over
matters
so
smoothly
to
make
us
poor
illiterate
people
swallow
the
pill
expect
to
get
into
congress
themselves
they
mean
to
get
all
the
money
into
their
hands
and
then
they
will
swallow
up
all
us
little
folk
like
the
leviathan
president
yea
just
as
the
whale
swallowed
up
jonah
if
the
voice
of
mary
ellen
lease
sounds
raucous
to
the
new
england
man
while
it
is
sweet
music
in
the
ears
of
the
kansas
farmer
let
him
ponder
the
utterances
of
these
frontier
farmers
in
the
days
of
the
revolution
and
if
he
is
still
doubtful
of
this
spiritual
kinship
let
him
read
the
words
of
the
levelers
and
sectaries
of
cromwell
army
the
story
of
the
political
leaders
who
remained
in
the
place
of
their
birth
and
shared
its
economic
changes
differs
from
the
story
of
those
who
by
moving
to
the
west
continued
on
a
new
area
the
old
social
type
in
the
throng
of
pioneers
that
entered
the
uplands
of
the
carolinas
in
the
second
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
century
were
the
ancestors
of
calhoun
and
of
andrew
jackson
remaining
in
this
region
calhoun
shared
the
transformations
of
the
south
carolina
interior
he
saw
it
change
from
the
area
of
the
pioneer
farmers
to
an
area
of
great
planters
raising
cotton
by
slave
labor
this
explains
the
transformation
of
the
nationalist
and
protectionist
calhoun
of
into
the
and
calhoun
jackson
on
the
other
hand
left
the
region
while
it
was
still
a
frontier
shared
the
frontier
life
of
tennessee
and
reflected
the
democracy
and
nationalism
of
his
people
henry
clay
lived
long
enough
in
the
kindred
state
of
kentucky
to
see
it
pass
from
a
frontier
to
a
settled
community
and
his
views
on
slavery
reflected
the
transitional
history
of
that
state
lincoln
on
the
other
hand
born
in
kentucky
in
while
the
state
was
still
under
frontier
conditions
migrated
in
to
indiana
and
in
to
illinois
the
pioneer
influences
of
his
community
did
much
to
shape
his
life
and
the
development
of
the
raw
frontiersman
into
the
statesman
was
not
unlike
the
development
of
his
own
state
political
leaders
who
experienced
the
later
growth
of
the
northwest
like
garfield
hayes
harrison
and
mckinley
show
clearly
the
continued
transformations
of
the
section
but
in
the
days
when
the
northwest
was
still
in
the
gristle
she
sent
her
sons
into
the
newer
west
to
continue
the
views
of
life
and
the
policies
of
the
region
they
had
left
the
northwest
standing
between
her
ancestral
connections
in
the
east
and
her
children
in
the
west
partly
like
the
east
partly
like
the
west
finds
herself
in
a
position
strangely
like
that
in
the
days
of
the
slavery
struggle
when
her
origins
presented
to
her
a
divided
duty
but
these
issues
are
not
with
the
same
imperious
which
as
was
the
issue
of
freedom
or
slavery
looking
at
the
northwest
as
a
whole
one
sees
in
the
character
of
its
industries
and
in
the
elements
of
its
population
it
is
identified
on
the
east
with
the
zone
of
states
including
the
middle
region
and
new
england
cotton
culture
and
the
negro
make
a
clear
line
of
division
between
the
old
northwest
and
the
south
and
yet
in
important
historical
ideals
in
the
process
of
expansion
in
the
persistence
of
agricultural
interests
in
impulsiveness
in
imperialistic
ways
of
looking
at
the
american
destiny
in
in
the
newness
of
its
present
social
structure
the
old
northwest
has
much
in
common
with
the
south
and
the
far
west
behind
her
is
the
old
pioneer
past
of
simple
democratic
conditions
and
freedom
of
opportunity
for
all
men
before
her
is
a
superb
industrial
development
the
brilliancy
of
success
as
evinced
in
a
vast

wealth
and
sectional
power

ix
contributions
of
the
west
to
american
democracy
political
thought
in
the
period
of
the
french
revolution
tended
to
treat
democracy
as
an
absolute
system
applicable
to
all
times
and
to
all
peoples
a
system
that
was
to
be
created
by
the
act
of
the
people
themselves
on
philosophical
principles
ever
since
that
era
there
has
been
an
inclination
on
the
part
of
writers
on
democracy
to
emphasize
the
analytical
and
theoretical
treatment
to
the
neglect
of
the
underlying
factors
of
historical
development
if
however
we
consider
the
underlying
conditions
and
forces
that
create
the
democratic
type
of
government
and
at
times
contradict
the
external
forms
to
which
the
name
democracy
is
applied
we
shall
find
that
under
this
name
there
have
appeared
a
multitude
of
political
types
radically
unlike
in
fact
the
careful
student
of
history
must
therefore
seek
the
explanation
of
the
forms
and
changes
of
political
institutions
in
the
social
and
economic
forces
that
determine
them
to
know
that
at
any
one
time
a
nation
may
be
called
a
democracy
an
aristocracy
or
a
monarchy
is
not
so
important
as
to
know
what
are
the
social
and
economic
tendencies
of
the
state
these
are
the
vital
forces
that
work
beneath
the
surface
and
dominate
the
external
form
it
is
to
changes
in
the
economic
and
social
life
of
a
people
that
we
must
look
for
the
forces
that
ultimately
create
and
modify
organs
of
political
action
for
the
time
adaptation
of
political
structure
may
be
incomplete
or
concealed
old
organs
will
be
utilized
to
express
new
forces
and
so
gradual
and
subtle
will
be
the
change
that
it
may
hardly
be
recognized
the
under
the
medici
at
florence
and
under
augustus
at
rome
are
familiar
examples
of
this
type
or
again
if
the
political
structure
be
rigid
incapable
of
responding
to
the
changes
demanded
by
growth
the
expansive
forces
of
social
and
economic
transformation
may
rend
it
in
some
catastrophe
like
that
of
the
french
revolution
in
all
these
changes
both
conscious
ideals
and
unconscious
social
reorganization
are
at
work
these
facts
are
familiar
to
the
student
and
yet
it
is
doubtful
if
they
have
been
fully
considered
in
connection
with
american
democracy
for
a
century
at
least
in
conventional
expression
americans
have
referred
to
a
glorious
constitution
in
explaining
the
stability
and
prosperity
of
their
democracy
we
have
believed
as
a
nation
that
other
peoples
had
only
to
will
our
democratic
institutions
in
order
to
repeat
our
own
career
in
dealing
with
western
contributions
to
democracy
it
is
essential
that
the
considerations
which
have
just
been
mentioned
shall
be
kept
in
mind
whatever
these
contributions
may
have
been
we
find
ourselves
at
the
present
time
in
an
era
of
such
profound
economic
and
social
transformation
as
to
raise
the
question
of
the
effect
of
these
changes
upon
the
democratic
institutions
of
the
united
states
within
a
decade
four
marked
changes
have
occurred
in
our
national
development
taken
together
they
constitute
a
revolution
first
there
is
the
exhaustion
of
the
supply
of
free
land
and
the
closing
of
the
movement
of
western
advance
as
an
effective
factor
in
american
development
the
first
rough
conquest
of
the
wilderness
is
accomplished
and
that
great
supply
of
free
lands
which
year
after
year
has
served
to
reinforce
the
democratic
influences
in
the
united
states
is
exhausted
it
is
true
that
vast
tracts
of
government
land
are
still
untaken
but
they
constitute
the
mountain
and
arid
regions
only
a
small
fraction
of
them
capable
of
conquest
and
then
only
by
the
application
of
capital
and
combined
effort
the
free
lands
that
made
the
american
pioneer
have
gone
in
the
second
place
contemporaneously
with
this
there
has
been
such
a
concentration
of
capital
in
the
control
of
fundamental
industries
as
to
make
a
new
epoch
in
the
economic
development
of
the
united
states
the
iron
the
coal
and
the
cattle
of
the
country
have
all
fallen
under
the
domination
of
a
few
great
corporations
with
allied
interests
and
by
the
rapid
combination
of
the
important
railroad
systems
and
steamship
lines
in
concert
with
these
same
forces
even
the
breadstuffs
and
the
manufactures
of
the
nation
are
to
some
degree
controlled
in
a
similar
way
this
is
largely
the
work
of
the
last
decade
the
development
of
the
greatest
iron
mines
of
lake
superior
occurred
in
the
early
nineties
and
in
the
same
decade
came
the
combination
by
which
the
coal
and
the
coke
of
the
country
and
the
transportation
systems
that
connect
them
with
the
iron
mines
have
been
brought
under
a
few
concentrated
managements
side
by
side
with
this
concentration
of
capital
has
gone
the
combination
of
labor
in
the
same
vast
industries
the
one
is
in
a
certain
sense
the
concomitant
of
the
other
but
the
movement
acquires
an
additional
significance
because
of
the
fact
that
during
the
past
fifteen
years
the
labor
class
has
been
so
recruited
by
a
tide
of
foreign
immigration
that
this
class
is
now
largely
made
up
of
persons
of
foreign
parentage
and
the
lines
of
cleavage
which
begin
to
appear
in
this
country
between
capital
and
labor
have
been
accentuated
by
distinctions
of
nationality
a
third
phenomenon
connected
with
the
two
just
mentioned
is
the
expansion
of
the
united
states
politically
and
commercially
into
lands
beyond
the
seas
a
cycle
of
american
development
has
been
completed
up
to
the
close
of
the
war
of
this
country
was
involved
in
the
fortunes
of
the
european
state
system
the
first
quarter
of
a
century
of
our
national
existence
was
almost
a
continual
struggle
to
prevent
ourselves
being
drawn
into
the
european
wars
at
the
close
of
that
era
of
conflict
the
united
states
set
its
face
toward
the
west
it
began
the
settlement
and
improvement
of
the
vast
interior
of
the
country
here
was
the
field
of
our
colonization
here
the
field
of
our
political
activity
this
process
being
completed
it
is
not
strange
that
we
find
the
united
states
again
involved
in
the
revolution
that
occurred
four
years
ago
when
the
united
states
struck
down
that
ancient
nation
under
whose
auspices
the
new
world
was
discovered
is
hardly
yet
more
than
dimly
understood
the
insular
wreckage
of
the
spanish
war
porto
rico
and
the
philippines
with
the
problems
presented
by
the
hawaiian
islands
cuba
the
isthmian
canal
and
china
all
are
indications
of
the
new
direction
of
the
ship
of
state
and
while
we
thus
turn
our
attention
overseas
our
concentrated
industrial
strength
has
given
us
a
striking
power
against
the
commerce
of
europe
that
is
already
producing
consternation
in
the
old
world
having
completed
the
conquest
of
the
wilderness
and
having
consolidated
our
interests
we
are
beginning
to
consider
the
relations
of
democracy
and
empire
and
fourth
the
political
parties
of
the
united
states
now
tend
to
divide
on
issues
that
involve
the
question
of
socialism
the
rise
of
the
populist
party
in
the
last
decade
and
the
acceptance
of
so
many
of
its
principles
by
the
democratic
party
under
the
leadership
of
bryan
show
in
striking
manner
the
birth
of
new
political
ideas
the
reformation
of
the
lines
of
political
conflict
it
is
doubtful
if
in
any
ten
years
of
american
history
more
significant
factors
in
our
growth
have
revealed
themselves
the
struggle
of
the
pioneer
farmers
to
subdue
the
arid
lands
of
the
great
plains
in
the
eighties
was
followed
by
the
official
announcement
of
the
extinction
of
the
frontier
line
in
the
dramatic
outcome
of
the
chicago
convention
of
marked
the
rise
into
power
of
the
representatives
of
populistic
change
two
years
later
came
the
battle
of
manila
which
broke
down
the
old
isolation
of
the
nation
and
started
it
on
a
path
the
goal
of
which
no
man
can
foretell
and
finally
but
two
years
ago
came
that
concentration
of
which
the
billion
and
a
half
dollar
steel
trust
and
the
union
of
the
northern
continental
railways
are
stupendous
examples
is
it
not
obvious
then
that
the
student
who
seeks
for
the
explanation
of
democracy
in
the
social
and
economic
forces
that
underlie
political
forms
must
make
inquiry
into
the
conditions
that
have
produced
our
democratic
institutions
if
he
would
estimate
the
effect
of
these
vast
changes
as
a
contribution
to
this
inquiry
let
us
now
turn
to
an
examination
of
the
part
that
the
west
has
played
in
shaping
our
democracy
from
the
beginning
of
the
settlement
of
america
the
frontier
regions
have
exercised
a
steady
influence
toward
democracy
in
virginia
to
take
an
example
it
can
be
traced
as
early
as
the
period
of
rebellion
a
hundred
years
before
our
declaration
of
independence
the
small
landholders
seeing
that
their
powers
were
steadily
passing
into
the
hands
of
the
wealthy
planters
who
controlled
church
and
state
and
lands
rose
in
revolt
a
generation
later
in
the
governorship
of
alexander
spotswood
we
find
a
contest
between
the
frontier
settlers
and
the
classes
of
the
coast
the
democracy
with
which
spotswood
had
to
struggle
and
of
which
he
so
bitterly
complained
was
a
democracy
made
up
of
small
landholders
of
the
newer
immigrants
and
of
indented
servants
who
at
the
expiration
of
their
time
of
servitude
passed
into
the
interior
to
take
up
lands
and
engage
in
pioneer
farming
the
war
of
the
regulation
just
on
the
eve
of
the
american
revolution
shows
the
steady
persistence
of
this
struggle
between
the
classes
of
the
interior
and
those
of
the
coast
the
declaration
of
grievances
which
the
back
counties
of
the
carolinas
then
drew
up
against
the
aristocracy
that
dominated
the
politics
of
those
colonies
exhibits
the
contest
between
the
democracy
of
the
frontier
and
the
established
classes
who
apportioned
the
legislature
in
such
fashion
as
to
secure
effective
control
of
government
indeed
in
a
period
before
the
outbreak
of
the
american
revolution
one
can
trace
a
distinct
belt
of
democratic
territory
extending
from
the
back
country
of
new
england
down
through
western
new
york
pennsylvania
and
the
south
in
each
colony
this
region
was
in
conflict
with
the
dominant
classes
of
the
coast
it
constituted
a
area
before
the
days
of
the
revolution
and
it
formed
the
basis
on
which
the
democratic
party
was
afterwards
established
it
was
therefore
in
the
west
as
it
was
in
the
period
before
the
declaration
of
independence
that
the
struggle
for
democratic
development
first
revealed
itself
and
in
that
area
the
essential
ideas
of
american
democracy
had
already
appeared
through
the
period
of
the
revolution
and
of
the
confederation
a
similar
contest
can
be
noted
on
the
frontier
of
new
england
along
the
western
border
of
pennsylvania
virginia
and
the
carolinas
and
in
the
communities
beyond
the
alleghany
mountains
there
arose
a
demand
of
the
frontier
settlers
for
independent
statehood
based
on
democratic
provisions
there
is
a
strain
of
fierceness
in
their
energetic
petitions
demanding
under
the
theory
that
every
people
have
the
right
to
establish
their
own
political
institutions
in
an
area
which
they
have
won
from
the
wilderness
those
revolutionary
principles
based
on
natural
rights
for
which
the
seaboard
colonies
were
contending
were
taken
up
with
frontier
energy
in
an
attempt
to
apply
them
to
the
lands
of
the
west
no
one
can
read
their
petitions
denouncing
the
control
exercised
by
the
wealthy
landholders
of
the
coast
appealing
to
the
record
of
their
conquest
of
the
wilderness
and
demanding
the
possession
of
the
lands
for
which
they
have
fought
the
indians
and
which
they
had
reduced
by
their
ax
to
civilization
without
recognizing
in
these
frontier
communities
the
cradle
of
a
belligerent
western
democracy
a
fool
can
sometimes
put
on
his
coat
better
than
a
wise
man
can
do
it
for
him
such
is
the
philosophy
of
its
petitioners
in
this
period
also
came
the
contests
of
the
interior
agricultural
portion
of
new
england
against
the
merchants
and
of
which
rebellion
is
the
best
known
although
by
no
means
an
isolated
instance
by
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention
this
struggle
for
democracy
had
affected
a
fairly
division
into
parties
although
these
parties
did
not
at
first
recognize
their
interstate
connections
there
were
similar
issues
on
which
they
split
in
almost
all
the
states
the
demands
for
an
issue
of
paper
money
the
stay
of
execution
against
debtors
and
the
relief
against
excessive
taxation
were
found
in
every
colony
in
the
interior
agricultural
regions
the
rise
of
this
significant
movement
wakened
the
apprehensions
of
the
men
of
means
and
in
the
debates
over
the
basis
of
suffrage
for
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
leaders
of
the
conservative
party
did
not
hesitate
to
demand
that
safeguards
to
the
property
should
be
furnished
the
coast
against
the
interior
the
outcome
of
the
debate
left
the
question
of
suffrage
for
the
house
of
representatives
dependent
upon
the
policy
of
the
separate
states
this
was
in
effect
imposing
a
property
qualification
throughout
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
it
was
only
as
the
interior
of
the
country
developed
that
these
restrictions
gradually
gave
way
in
the
direction
of
manhood
suffrage
all
of
these
scattered
democratic
tendencies
jefferson
combined
in
the
period
of
washington
presidency
into
the
party
jefferson
was
the
first
prophet
of
american
democracy
and
when
we
analyse
the
essential
features
of
his
gospel
it
is
clear
that
the
western
influence
was
the
dominant
element
jefferson
himself
was
born
in
the
frontier
region
of
virginia
on
the
edge
of
the
blue
ridge
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
his
father
was
a
pioneer
jefferson
notes
on
virginia
reveal
clearly
his
conception
that
democracy
should
have
an
agricultural
basis
and
that
manufacturing
development
and
city
life
were
dangerous
to
the
purity
of
the
body
politic
simplicity
and
economy
in
government
the
right
of
revolution
the
freedom
of
the
individual
the
belief
that
those
who
win
the
vacant
lands
are
entitled
to
shape
their
own
government
in
their
own
way
these
are
all
parts
of
the
platform
of
political
principles
to
which
he
gave
his
adhesion
and
they
are
all
elements
eminently
characteristic
of
the
western
democracy
into
which
he
was
born
in
the
period
of
the
revolution
he
had
brought
in
a
series
of
measures
which
tended
to
throw
the
power
of
virginia
into
the
hands
of
the
settlers
in
the
interior
rather
than
of
the
coastwise
aristocracy
the
repeal
of
the
laws
of
entail
and
primogeniture
would
have
destroyed
the
great
estates
on
which
the
planting
aristocracy
based
its
power
the
abolition
of
the
established
church
would
still
further
have
diminished
the
influence
of
the
coastwise
party
in
favor
of
the
dissenting
sects
of
the
interior
his
scheme
of
general
public
education
reflected
the
same
tendency
and
his
demand
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
was
characteristic
of
a
representative
of
the
west
rather
than
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
coast
his
sympathy
with
the
western
expansion
culminated
in
the
louisiana
purchase
in
short
the
tendencies
of
jefferson
legislation
were
to
replace
the
dominance
of
the
planting
aristocracy
by
the
dominance
of
the
interior
class
which
had
sought
in
vain
to
achieve
its
liberties
in
the
period
of
bacon
rebellion
nevertheless
thomas
jefferson
was
the
john
the
baptist
of
democracy
not
its
moses
only
with
the
slow
setting
of
the
tide
of
settlement
farther
and
farther
toward
the
interior
did
the
democratic
influence
grow
strong
enough
to
take
actual
possession
of
the
government
the
period
from
to
saw
a
steady
increase
in
these
tendencies
the
established
classes
in
new
england
and
the
south
began
to
take
alarm
perhaps
no
better
illustration
of
the
apprehensions
of
the
federal
conservative
can
be
given
than
these
utterances
of
president
dwight
of
yale
college
in
the
book
of
travels
which
he
published
in
that
period
the
class
of
pioneers
can
not
live
in
regular
society
they
are
too
idle
too
talkative
too
passionate
too
prodigal
and
too
shiftless
to
acquire
either
property
or
character
they
are
impatient
of
the
restraints
of
law
religion
and
morality
and
grumble
about
the
taxes
by
which
the
rulers
ministers
and
schoolmasters
are
supported
after
exposing
the
injustice
of
the
community
in
neglecting
to
invest
persons
of
such
superior
merit
in
public
offices
in
many
an
eloquent
harangue
uttered
by
many
a
kitchen
fire
in
every
blacksmith
shop
in
every
corner
of
the
streets
and
finding
all
their
efforts
vain
they
become
at
length
discouraged
and
under
the
pressure
of
poverty
the
fear
of
the
gaol
and
consciousness
of
public
contempt
leave
their
native
places
and
betake
themselves
to
the
wilderness
such
was
a
conservative
impression
of
that
pioneer
movement
of
new
england
colonists
who
had
spread
up
the
valley
of
the
connecticut
into
new
hampshire
vermont
and
western
new
york
in
the
period
of
which
he
wrote
and
who
afterwards
went
on
to
possess
the
northwest
new
england
federalism
looked
with
a
shudder
at
the
democratic
ideas
of
those
who
refused
to
recognize
the
established
order
but
in
that
period
there
came
into
the
union
a
sisterhood
of
frontier
states
ohio
indiana
illinois
missouri
with
provisions
for
the
franchise
that
brought
in
complete
democracy
even
the
newly
created
states
of
the
southwest
showed
the
tendency
the
wind
of
democracy
blew
so
strongly
from
the
west
that
even
in
the
older
states
of
new
york
massachusetts
connecticut
and
virginia
conventions
were
called
which
liberalized
their
constitutions
by
strengthening
the
democratic
basis
of
the
state
in
the
same
time
the
labor
population
of
the
cities
began
to
assert
its
power
and
its
determination
to
share
in
government
of
this
frontier
democracy
which
now
took
possession
of
the
nation
andrew
jackson
was
the
very
personification
he
was
born
in
the
backwoods
of
the
carolinas
in
the
midst
of
the
turbulent
democracy
that
preceded
the
revolution
and
he
grew
up
in
the
frontier
state
of
tennessee
in
the
midst
of
this
region
of
personal
feuds
and
frontier
ideals
of
law
he
quickly
rose
to
leadership
the
appearance
of
this
frontiersman
on
the
floor
of
congress
was
an
omen
full
of
significance
he
reached
philadelphia
at
the
close
of
washington
administration
having
ridden
on
horseback
nearly
eight
hundred
miles
to
his
destination
gallatin
himself
a
western
man
describes
jackson
as
he
entered
the
halls
of
congress
a
tall
lank
personage
with
long
locks
of
hair
hanging
over
his
face
and
a
cue
down
his
back
tied
in
an
his
dress
singular
his
manners
those
of
a
rough
backwoodsman
and
jefferson
testified
when
i
was
president
of
the
senate
he
was
a
senator
and
he
could
never
speak
on
account
of
the
rashness
of
his
feelings
i
have
seen
him
attempt
it
repeatedly
and
as
often
choke
with
rage
at
last
the
frontier
in
the
person
of
its
typical
man
had
found
a
place
in
the
government
this
backwoodsman
with
blue
eyes
that
could
blaze
on
occasion
this
choleric
impetuous
leader
of
men
this
expert
duelist
and
ready
fighter
this
embodiment
of
the
tenacious
vehement
personal
west
was
in
politics
to
stay
the
frontier
democracy
of
that
time
had
the
instincts
of
the
clansman
in
the
days
of
scotch
border
warfare
vehement
and
tenacious
as
the
democracy
was
strenuously
as
each
man
contended
with
his
neighbor
for
the
spoils
of
the
new
country
that
opened
before
them
they
all
had
respect
for
the
man
who
best
expressed
their
aspirations
and
their
ideas
every
community
had
its
hero
in
the
war
of
and
the
subsequent
indian
fighting
jackson
made
good
his
claim
not
only
to
the
loyalty
of
the
people
of
tennessee
but
of
the
whole
west
and
even
of
the
nation
he
had
the
essential
traits
of
the
kentucky
and
tennessee
frontier
it
was
a
frontier
free
from
the
influence
of
european
ideas
and
institutions
the
men
of
the
western
world
turned
their
backs
upon
the
atlantic
ocean
and
with
a
grim
energy
and
began
to
build
up
a
society
free
from
the
dominance
of
ancient
forms
the
westerner
defended
himself
and
resented
governmental
restrictions
the
duel
and
the
found
congenial
soil
in
kentucky
and
tennessee
the
idea
of
the
personality
of
law
was
often
dominant
over
the
organized
machinery
of
justice
that
method
was
best
which
was
most
direct
and
effective
the
backwoodsman
was
intolerant
of
men
who
split
hairs
or
scrupled
over
the
method
of
reaching
the
right
in
a
word
the
unchecked
development
of
the
individual
was
the
significant
product
of
this
frontier
democracy
it
sought
rather
to
express
itself
by
choosing
a
man
of
the
people
than
by
the
formation
of
elaborate
governmental
institutions
it
was
because
andrew
jackson
personified
these
essential
western
traits
that
in
his
presidency
he
became
the
idol
and
the
mouthpiece
of
the
popular
will
in
his
assault
upon
the
bank
as
an
engine
of
aristocracy
and
in
his
denunciation
of
nullification
he
went
directly
to
his
object
with
the
ruthless
energy
of
a
frontiersman
for
formal
law
and
the
subtleties
of
state
sovereignty
he
had
the
contempt
of
a
backwoodsman
nor
is
it
without
significance
that
this
typical
man
of
the
new
democracy
will
always
be
associated
with
the
triumph
of
the
spoils
system
in
national
politics
to
the
new
democracy
of
the
west
office
was
an
opportunity
to
exercise
natural
rights
as
an
equal
citizen
of
the
community
rotation
in
office
served
not
simply
to
allow
the
successful
man
to
punish
his
enemies
and
reward
his
friends
but
it
also
furnished
the
training
in
the
actual
conduct
of
political
affairs
which
every
american
claimed
as
his
birthright
only
in
a
primitive
democracy
of
the
type
of
the
united
states
in
could
such
a
system
have
existed
without
the
ruin
of
the
state
national
government
in
that
period
was
no
complex
and
nicely
adjusted
machine
and
the
evils
of
the
system
were
long
in
making
themselves
fully
apparent
the
triumph
of
andrew
jackson
marked
the
end
of
the
old
era
of
trained
statesmen
for
the
presidency
with
him
began
the
era
of
the
popular
hero
even
martin
van
buren
whom
we
think
of
in
connection
with
the
east
was
born
in
a
log
house
under
conditions
that
were
not
unlike
parts
of
the
older
west
harrison
was
the
hero
of
the
northwest
as
jackson
had
been
of
the
southwest
polk
was
a
typical
tennesseean
eager
to
expand
the
nation
and
zachary
taylor
was
what
webster
called
a
frontier
colonel
during
the
period
that
followed
jackson
power
passed
from
the
region
of
kentucky
and
tennessee
to
the
border
of
the
mississippi
the
natural
democratic
tendencies
that
had
earlier
shown
themselves
in
the
gulf
states
were
destroyed
however
by
the
spread
of
cotton
culture
and
the
development
of
great
plantations
in
that
region
what
had
been
typical
of
the
democracy
of
the
revolutionary
frontier
and
of
the
frontier
of
andrew
jackson
was
now
to
be
seen
in
the
states
between
the
ohio
and
the
mississippi
as
andrew
jackson
is
the
typical
democrat
of
the
former
region
so
abraham
lincoln
is
the
very
embodiment
of
the
pioneer
period
of
the
old
northwest
indeed
he
is
the
embodiment
of
the
democracy
of
the
west
how
can
one
speak
of
him
except
in
the
words
of
lowell
great
commemoration
ode
for
him
her
moulds
aside
she
threw
and
choosing
sweet
clay
from
the
breast
of
the
unexhausted
west
with
stuff
untainted
shaped
a
hero
new
wise
steadfast
in
the
strength
of
god
and
true
his
was
no
lonely
of
mind
thrusting
to
thin
air
our
cloudy
bars
a
now
now
lost
in
vapors
blind
broad
prairie
rather
genial
fruitful
and
friendly
for
all
human
kind
yet
also

deface
new
birth
of
our
new
soil
the
first
american
the
pioneer
life
from
which
lincoln
came
differed
in
important
respects
from
the
frontier
democracy
typified
by
andrew
jackson
democracy
was
contentious
individualistic
and
it
sought
the
ideal
of
local
and
expansion
lincoln
represents
rather
the
pioneer
folk
who
entered
the
forest
of
the
great
northwest
to
chop
out
a
home
to
build
up
their
fortunes
in
the
midst
of
a
continually
ascending
industrial
movement
in
the
democracy
of
the
southwest
industrial
development
and
city
life
were
only
minor
factors
but
to
the
democracy
of
the
northwest
they
were
its
very
life
to
widen
the
area
of
the
clearing
to
contend
with
one
another
for
the
mastery
of
the
industrial
resources
of
the
rich
provinces
to
struggle
for
a
place
in
the
ascending
movement
of
society
to
transmit
to
one
offspring
the
chance
for
education
for
industrial
betterment
for
the
rise
in
life
which
the
hardships
of
the
pioneer
existence
denied
to
the
pioneer
himself
these
were
some
of
the
ideals
of
the
region
to
which
lincoln
came
the
men
were
commonwealth
builders
industry
builders
whereas
the
type
of
hero
in
the
southwest
was
militant
in
the
northwest
he
was
industrial
it
was
in
the
midst
of
these
plain
people
as
he
loved
to
call
them
that
lincoln
grew
to
manhood
as
emerson
says
he
is
the
true
history
of
the
american
people
in
his
time
the
years
of
his
early
life
were
the
years
when
the
democracy
of
the
northwest
came
into
struggle
with
the
institution
of
slavery
which
threatened
to
forbid
the
expansion
of
the
democratic
pioneer
life
in
the
west
in
president
eliot
essay
on
five
american
contributions
to
civilization
he
instances
as
one
of
the
supreme
tests
of
american
democracy
its
attitude
upon
the
question
of
slavery
but
if
democracy
chose
wisely
and
worked
effectively
toward
the
solution
of
this
problem
it
must
be
remembered
that
western
democracy
took
the
lead
the
himself
became
the
nation
president
in
that
fierce
time
of
struggle
and
armies
of
the
woodsmen
and
pioneer
farmers
recruited
in
the
old
northwest
made
free
the
father
of
waters
marched
through
georgia
and
helped
to
force
the
struggle
to
a
conclusion
at
appomattox
the
free
pioneer
democracy
struck
down
the
aristocracy
on
its
march
to
the
west
the
last
chapter
in
the
development
of
western
democracy
is
the
one
that
deals
with
its
conquest
over
the
vast
spaces
of
the
new
west
at
each
new
stage
of
western
development
the
people
have
had
to
grapple
with
larger
areas
with
bigger
combinations
the
little
colony
of
massachusetts
veterans
that
settled
at
marietta
received
a
land
grant
as
large
as
the
state
of
rhode
island
the
band
of
connecticut
pioneers
that
followed
moses
cleaveland
to
the
connecticut
reserve
occupied
a
region
as
large
as
the
parent
state
the
area
which
settlers
of
new
england
stock
occupied
on
the
prairies
of
northern

area
of
massachusetts
connecticut
and
rhode
island
men
who
had
become
accustomed
to
the
narrow
valleys
and
the
little
towns
of
the
east
found
themselves
out
on
the
boundless
spaces
of
the
west
dealing
with
units
of
such
magnitude
as
dwarfed
their
former
experience
the
great
lakes
the
prairies
the
great
plains
the
rocky
mountains
the
mississippi
and
the
missouri
furnished
new
standards
of
measurement
for
the
achievement
of
this
industrial
democracy
individualism
began
to
give
way
to
coöperation
and
to
governmental
activity
even
in
the
earlier
days
of
the
democratic
conquest
of
the
wilderness
demands
had
been
made
upon
the
government
for
support
in
internal
improvements
but
this
new
west
showed
a
growing
tendency
to
call
to
its
assistance
the
powerful
arm
of
national
authority
in
the
period
since
the
civil
war
the
vast
public
domain
has
been
donated
to
the
individual
farmer
to
states
for
education
to
railroads
for
the
construction
of
transportation
lines
moreover
with
the
advent
of
democracy
in
the
last
fifteen
years
upon
the
great
plains
new
physical
conditions
have
presented
themselves
which
have
accelerated
the
social
tendency
of
western
democracy
the
pioneer
farmer
of
the
days
of
lincoln
could
place
his
family
on
a
flatboat
strike
into
the
wilderness
cut
out
his
clearing
and
with
little
or
no
capital
go
on
to
the
achievement
of
industrial
independence
even
the
homesteader
on
the
western
prairies
found
it
possible
to
work
out
a
similar
independent
destiny
although
the
factor
of
transportation
made
a
serious
and
increasing
impediment
to
the
free
of
his
individual
career
but
when
the
arid
lands
and
the
mineral
resources
of
the
far
west
were
reached
no
conquest
was
possible
by
the
old
individual
pioneer
methods
here
expensive
irrigation
works
must
be
constructed
coöperative
activity
was
demanded
in
utilization
of
the
water
supply
capital
beyond
the
reach
of
the
small
farmer
was
required
in
a
word
the
physiographic
province
itself
decreed
that
the
destiny
of
this
new
frontier
should
be
social
rather
than
individual
magnitude
of
social
achievement
is
the
watchword
of
the
democracy
since
the
civil
war
from
petty
towns
built
in
the
marshes
cities
arose
whose
greatness
and
industrial
power
are
the
wonder
of
our
time
the
conditions
were
ideal
for
the
production
of
captains
of
industry
the
old
democratic
admiration
for
the
man
its
old
deference
to
the
rights
of
competitive
individual
development
together
with
the
stupendous
natural
resources
that
opened
to
the
conquest
of
the
keenest
and
the
strongest
gave
such
conditions
of
mobility
as
enabled
the
development
of
the
large
corporate
industries
which
in
our
own
decade
have
marked
the
west
thus
in
brief
have
been
outlined
the
chief
phases
of
the
development
of
western
democracy
in
the
different
areas
which
it
has
conquered
there
has
been
a
steady
development
of
the
industrial
ideal
and
a
steady
increase
of
the
social
tendency
in
this
later
movement
of
western
democracy
while
the
individualism
of
the
frontier
so
prominent
in
the
earliest
days
of
the
western
advance
has
been
preserved
as
an
ideal
more
and
more
these
individuals
struggling
each
with
the
other
dealing
with
vaster
and
vaster
areas
with
larger
and
larger
problems
have
found
it
necessary
to
combine
under
the
leadership
of
the
strongest
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
rise
of
those
preëminent
captains
of
industry
whose
genius
has
concentrated
capital
to
control
the
fundamental
resources
of
the
nation
if
now
in
the
way
of
recapitulation
we
try
to
pick
out
from
the
influences
that
have
gone
to
the
making
of
western
democracy
the
factors
which
constitute
the
net
result
of
this
movement
we
shall
have
to
mention
at
least
the
following
most
important
of
all
has
been
the
fact
that
an
area
of
free
land
has
continually
lain
on
the
western
border
of
the
settled
area
of
the
united
states
whenever
social
conditions
tended
to
crystallize
in
the
east
whenever
capital
tended
to
press
upon
labor
or
political
restraints
to
impede
the
freedom
of
the
mass
there
was
this
gate
of
escape
to
the
free
conditions
of
the
frontier
these
free
lands
promoted
individualism
economic
equality
freedom
to
rise
democracy
men
would
not
accept
inferior
wages
and
a
permanent
position
of
social
subordination
when
this
promised
land
of
freedom
and
equality
was
theirs
for
the
taking
who
would
rest
content
under
oppressive
legislative
conditions
when
with
a
slight
effort
he
might
reach
a
land
wherein
to
become
a
in
the
building
of
free
cities
and
free
states
on
the
lines
of
his
own
ideal
in
a
word
then
free
lands
meant
free
opportunities
their
existence
has
differentiated
the
american
democracy
from
the
democracies
which
have
preceded
it
because
ever
as
democracy
in
the
east
took
the
form
of
highly
specialized
and
complicated
industrial
society
in
the
west
it
kept
in
touch
with
primitive
conditions
and
by
action
and
reaction
these
two
forces
have
shaped
our
history
in
the
next
place
these
free
lands
and
this
treasury
of
industrial
resources
have
existed
over
such
vast
spaces
that
they
have
demanded
of
democracy
increasing
spaciousness
of
design
and
power
of
execution
western
democracy
is
contrasted
with
the
democracy
of
all
other
times
in
the
largeness
of
the
tasks
to
which
it
has
set
its
hand
and
in
the
vast
achievements
which
it
has
wrought
out
in
the
control
of
nature
and
of
politics
it
would
be
difficult
to
the
importance
of
this
training
upon
democracy
never
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
has
a
democracy
existed
on
so
vast
an
area
and
handled
things
in
the
gross
with
such
success
with
such
largeness
of
design
and
such
grasp
upon
the
means
of
execution
in
short
democracy
has
learned
in
the
west
of
the
united
states
how
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
magnitude
the
old
historic
democracies
were
but
little
states
with
primitive
economic
conditions
but
the
very
task
of
dealing
with
vast
resources
over
vast
areas
under
the
conditions
of
free
competition
furnished
by
the
west
has
produced
the
rise
of
those
captains
of
industry
whose
success
in
consolidating
economic
power
now
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
democracy
under
such
conditions
can
survive
for
the
old
military
type
of
western
leaders
like
george
rogers
clark
andrew
jackson
and
william
henry
harrison
have
been
substituted
such
industrial
leaders
as
james
hill
john
rockefeller
and
andrew
carnegie
the
question
is
imperative
then
what
ideals
persist
from
this
democratic
experience
of
the
west
and
have
they
acquired
sufficient
momentum
to
sustain
themselves
under
conditions
so
radically
unlike
those
in
the
days
of
their
origin
in
other
words
the
question
put
at
the
beginning
of
this
discussion
becomes
pertinent
under
the
forms
of
the
american
democracy
is
there
in
reality
evolving
such
a
concentration
of
economic
and
social
power
in
the
hands
of
a
comparatively
few
men
as
may
make
political
democracy
an
appearance
rather
than
a
reality
the
free
lands
are
gone
the
material
forces
that
gave
vitality
to
western
democracy
are
passing
away
it
is
to
the
realm
of
the
spirit
to
the
domain
of
ideals
and
legislation
that
we
must
look
for
western
influence
upon
democracy
in
our
own
days
western
democracy
has
been
from
the
time
of
its
birth
idealistic
the
very
fact
of
the
wilderness
appealed
to
men
as
a
fair
blank
page
on
which
to
write
a
new
chapter
in
the
story
of
man
struggle
for
a
higher
type
of
society
the
western
wilds
from
the
alleghanies
to
the
pacific
constituted
the
richest
free
gift
that
was
ever
spread
out
before
civilized
man
to
the
peasant
and
artisan
of
the
old
world
bound
by
the
chains
of
social
class
as
old
as
custom
and
as
inevitable
as
fate
the
west
offered
an
exit
into
a
free
life
and
greater
among
the
bounties
of
nature
into
the
midst
of
resources
that
demanded
manly
exertion
and
that
gave
in
return
the
chance
for
indefinite
ascent
in
the
scale
of
social
advance
to
each
she
offered
gifts
after
his
will
never
again
can
such
an
opportunity
come
to
the
sons
of
men
it
was
unique
and
the
thing
is
so
near
us
so
much
a
part
of
our
lives
that
we
do
not
even
yet
comprehend
its
full
significance
the
existence
of
this
land
of
opportunity
has
made
america
the
goal
of
idealists
from
the
days
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
with
all
the
materialism
of
the
pioneer
movements
this
idealistic
conception
of
the
vacant
lands
as
an
opportunity
for
a
new
order
of
things
is
unmistakably
present
kipling
song
of
the
english
has
given
it
expression
we
were
dreamers
dreaming
greatly
in
the
town
we
yearned
beyond
the
where
the
strange
roads
go
down
came
the
whisper
came
the
vision
came
the
power
with
the
need
till
the
soul
that
is
not
man
soul
was
lent
us
to
lead
as
the
deer
breaks
as
the
steer
breaks
from
the
herd
where
they
graze
in
the
faith
of
little
children
we
went
on
our
ways
then
the
wood
failed
then
the
food
failed
then
the
last
water
dried
in
the
faith
of
little
children
we
lay
down
and
died
on
the
on
the
in
the
we
lay
that
our
sons
might
follow
after
by
the
bones
on
the
way
follow
after
follow
after
we
have
watered
the
root
and
the
bud
has
come
to
blossom
that
ripens
for
fruit
follow
after
we
are
waiting
by
the
trails
that
we
lost
for
the
sound
of
many
footsteps
for
the
tread
of
a
host
follow
after
follow
after
for
the
harvest
is
sown
by
the
bones
about
the
wayside
ye
shall
come
to
your
own
this
was
the
vision
that
called
to
roger
williams
that
prophetic
soul
ravished
of
truth
disembodied
unable
to
enter
into
treaty
with
its
environment
and
forced
to
seek
the
wilderness
oh
how
sweet
wrote
william
penn
from
his
forest
refuge
is
the
quiet
of
these
parts
freed
from
the
troubles
and
perplexities
of
woeful
europe
and
here
he
projected
what
he
called
his
holy
experiment
in
government
if
the
later
west
offers
few
such
striking
illustrations
of
the
relation
of
the
wilderness
to
idealistic
schemes
and
if
some
of
the
designs
were
fantastic
and
abortive
none
the
less
the
influence
is
a
fact
hardly
a
western
state
but
has
been
the
mecca
of
some
sect
or
band
of
social
reformers
anxious
to
put
into
practice
their
ideals
in
vacant
land
far
removed
from
the
checks
of
a
settled
form
of
social
organization
consider
the
dunkards
the
icarians
the
fourierists
the
mormons
and
similar
idealists
who
sought
our
western
wilds
but
the
idealistic
influence
is
not
limited
to
the
dreamers
conception
of
a
new
state
it
gave
to
the
pioneer
farmer
and
city
builder
a
restless
energy
a
quick
capacity
for
judgment
and
action
a
belief
in
liberty
freedom
of
opportunity
and
a
resistance
to
the
domination
of
class
which
infused
a
vitality
and
power
into
the
individual
atoms
of
this
democratic
mass
even
as
he
dwelt
among
the
stumps
of
his
clearing
the
pioneer
had
the
creative
vision
of
a
new
order
of
society
in
imagination
he
pushed
back
the
forest
boundary
to
the
confines
of
a
mighty
commonwealth
he
willed
that
log
cabins
should
become
the
lofty
buildings
of
great
cities
he
decreed
that
his
children
should
enter
into
a
heritage
of
education
comfort
and
social
welfare
and
for
this
ideal
he
bore
the
scars
of
the
wilderness
possessed
with
this
idea
he
ennobled
his
task
and
laid
deep
foundations
for
a
democratic
state
nor
was
this
idealism
by
any
means
limited
to
the
american
pioneer
to
the
old
native
democratic
stock
has
been
added
a
vast
army
of
recruits
from
the
old
world
there
are
in
the
middle
west
alone
four
million
persons
of
german
parentage
out
of
a
total
of
seven
millions
in
the
country
over
a
million
persons
of
scandinavian
parentage
live
in
the
same
region
the
democracy
of
the
newer
west
is
deeply
affected
by
the
ideals
brought
by
these
immigrants
from
the
old
world
to
them
america
was
not
simply
a
new
home
it
was
a
land
of
opportunity
of
freedom
of
democracy
it
meant
to
them
as
to
the
american
pioneer
that
preceded
them
the
opportunity
to
destroy
the
bonds
of
social
caste
that
bound
them
in
their
older
home
to
hew
out
for
themselves
in
a
new
country
a
destiny
proportioned
to
the
powers
that
god
had
given
them
a
chance
to
place
their
families
under
better
conditions
and
to
win
a
larger
life
than
the
life
that
they
had
left
behind
he
who
believes
that
even
the
hordes
of
recent
immigrants
from
southern
italy
are
drawn
to
these
shores
by
nothing
more
than
a
dull
and
blind
materialism
has
not
penetrated
into
the
heart
of
the
problem
the
idealism
and
expectation
of
these
children
of
the
old
world
the
hopes
which
they
have
formed
for
a
newer
and
freer
life
across
the
seas
are
almost
pathetic
when
one
considers
how
far
they
are
from
the
possibility
of
fruition
he
who
would
take
stock
of
american
democracy
must
not
forget
the
accumulation
of
human
purposes
and
ideals
which
immigration
has
added
to
the
american
populace
in
this
connection
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
these
democratic
ideals
have
existed
at
each
stage
of
the
advance
of
the
frontier
and
have
left
behind
them
deep
and
enduring
effects
on
the
thinking
of
the
whole
country
long
after
the
frontier
period
of
a
particular
region
of
the
united
states
has
passed
away
the
conception
of
society
the
ideals
and
aspirations
which
it
produced
persist
in
the
minds
of
the
people
so
recent
has
been
the
transition
of
the
greater
portion
of
the
united
states
from
frontier
conditions
to
conditions
of
settled
life
that
we
are
over
the
large
portion
of
the
united
states
hardly
a
generation
removed
from
the
primitive
conditions
of
the
west
if
indeed
we
ourselves
were
not
pioneers
our
fathers
were
and
the
inherited
ways
of
looking
at
things
the
fundamental
assumptions
of
the
american
people
have
all
been
shaped
by
this
experience
of
democracy
on
its
westward
march
this
experience
has
been
wrought
into
the
very
warp
and
woof
of
american
thought
even
those
masters
of

and

doubtless
true
since
the
corporation
has
been
one
of
the
means
by
which
small
properties
can
be
aggregated
into
an
effective
working
body
socialistic
writers
have
long
been
fond
of
pointing
out
also
that
these
various
concentrations
pave
the
way
for
and
make
possible
social
control
from
this
point
of
view
it
is
possible
that
the
masters
of
industry
may
prove
to
be
not
so
much
an
incipient
aristocracy
as
the
pathfinders
for
democracy
in
reducing
the
industrial
world
to
systematic
consolidation
suited
to
democratic
control
the
great
geniuses
that
have
built
up
the
modern
industrial
concentration
were
trained
in
the
midst
of
democratic
society
they
were
the
product
of
these
democratic
conditions
freedom
to
rise
was
the
very
condition
of
their
existence
whether
they
will
be
followed
by
successors
who
will
adopt
the
exploitation
of
the
masses
and
who
will
be
capable
of
retaining
under
efficient
control
these
vast
resources
is
one
of
the
questions
which
we
shall
have
to
face
this
at
least
is
clear
american
democracy
is
fundamentally
the
outcome
of
the
experiences
of
the
american
people
in
dealing
with
the
west
western
democracy
through
the
whole
of
its
earlier
period
tended
to
the
production
of
a
society
of
which
the
most
distinctive
fact
was
the
freedom
of
the
individual
to
rise
under
conditions
of
social
mobility
and
whose
ambition
was
the
liberty
and
of
the
masses
this
conception
has
vitalized
all
american
democracy
and
has
brought
it
into
sharp
contrasts
with
the
democracies
of
history
and
with
those
modern
efforts
of
europe
to
create
an
artificial
democratic
order
by
legislation
the
problem
of
the
united
states
is
not
to
create
democracy
but
to
conserve
democratic
institutions
and
ideals
in
the
later
period
of
its
development
western
democracy
has
been
gaining
experience
in
the
problem
of
social
control
it
has
steadily
enlarged
the
sphere
of
its
action
and
the
instruments
for
its
perpetuation
by
its
system
of
public
schools
from
the
grades
to
the
graduate
work
of
the
great
universities
the
west
has
created
a
larger
single
body
of
intelligent
plain
people
than
can
be
found
elsewhere
in
the
world
its
political
tendencies
whether
we
consider
democracy
populism
or
republicanism
are
distinctly
in
the
direction
of
greater
social
control
and
the
conservation
of
the
old
democratic
ideals
to
these
ideals
the
west
adheres
with
even
a
passionate
determination
if
in
working
out
its
mastery
of
the
resources
of
the
interior
it
has
produced
a
type
of
industrial
leader
so
powerful
as
to
be
the
wonder
of
the
world
nevertheless
it
is
still
to
be
determined
whether
these
men
constitute
a
menace
to
democratic
institutions
or
the
most
efficient
factor
for
adjusting
democratic
control
to
the
new
conditions
whatever
shall
be
the
outcome
of
the
rush
of
this
huge
industrial
modern
united
states
to
its
place
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
the
formation
of
its
western
democracy
will
always
remain
one
of
the
wonderful
chapters
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
into
this
vast
shaggy
continent
of
ours
poured
the
first
feeble
tide
of
european
settlement
european
men
institutions
and
ideas
were
lodged
in
the
american
wilderness
and
this
great
american
west
took
them
to
her
bosom
taught
them
a
new
way
of
looking
upon
the
destiny
of
the
common
man
trained
them
in
adaptation
to
the
conditions
of
the
new
world
to
the
creation
of
new
institutions
to
meet
new
needs
and
ever
as
society
on
her
eastern
border
grew
to
resemble
the
old
world
in
its
social
forms
and
its
industry
ever
as
it
began
to
lose
faith
in
the
ideals
of
democracy
she
opened
new
provinces
and
dowered
new
democracies
in
her
most
distant
domains
with
her
material
treasures
and
with
the
ennobling
influence
that
the
fierce
love
of
freedom
the
strength
that
came
from
hewing
out
a
home
making
a
school
and
a
church
and
creating
a
higher
future
for
his
family
furnished
to
the
pioneer
she
gave
to
the
world
such
types
as
the
farmer
thomas
jefferson
with
his
declaration
of
independence
his
statute
for
religious
toleration
and
his
purchase
of
louisiana
she
gave
us
andrew
jackson
that
fierce
tennessee
spirit
who
broke
down
the
traditions
of
conservative
rule
swept
away
the
privacies
and
privileges
of
officialdom
and
like
a
gothic
leader
opened
the
temple
of
the
nation
to
the
populace
she
gave
us
abraham
lincoln
whose
gaunt
frontier
form
and
gnarled
massive
hand
told
of
the
conflict
with
the
forest
whose
grasp
of
the
of
the
pioneer
was
no
firmer
than
his
grasp
of
the
helm
of
the
ship
of
state
as
it
breasted
the
seas
of
civil
war
she
has
furnished
to
this
new
democracy
her
stores
of
mineral
wealth
that
dwarf
those
of
the
old
world
and
her
provinces
that
in
themselves
are
vaster
and
more
productive
than
most
of
the
nations
of
europe
out
of
her
bounty
has
come
a
nation
whose
industrial
competition
alarms
the
old
world
and
the
masters
of
whose
resources
wield
wealth
and
power
vaster
than
the
wealth
and
power
of
kings
best
of
all
the
west
gave
not
only
to
the
american
but
to
the
unhappy
and
oppressed
of
all
lands
a
vision
of
hope
and
assurance
that
the
world
held
a
place
where
were
to
be
found
high
faith
in
man
and
the
will
and
power
to
furnish
him
the
opportunity
to
grow
to
the
full
measure
of
his

capacity
great
and
powerful
as
are
the
new
sons

the
republic
is
greater
than
they
the
paths
of
the

have
widened
into

let
us
see

their

their

ambitions
their
dreams
and
determinations
are
assets
in
their
civilization
as
real
and
important
as
per

wealth
or
industrial
skill
this
nation
was
formed
under
pioneer
ideals
during
three
centuries
after
captain
john
smith
struck
the
first
blow
at
the
american
forest
on
the
eastern
edge
of
the
continent
the
pioneers
were
abandoning
settled
society
for
the
wilderness
seeking
for
generation
after
generation
new
frontiers
their
experiences
left
abiding
influences
upon
the
ideas
and
purposes
of
the
nation
indeed
the
older
settled
regions
themselves
were
shaped
profoundly
by
the
very
fact
that
the
whole
nation
was
pioneering
and
that
in
the
development
of
the
west
the
east
had
its
own
part
the
first
ideal
of
the
pioneer
was
that
of
conquest
it
was
his
task
to
fight
with
nature
for
the
chance
to
exist
not
as
in
older
countries
did
this
contest
take
place
in
a
mythical
past
told
in
folk
lore
and
epic
it
has
been
continuous
to
our
own
day
facing
each
generation
of
pioneers
was
the
unmastered
continent
vast
forests
blocked
the
way
mountainous
ramparts
interposed
desolate
prairies
barren
oceans
of
rolling
plains
arid
deserts
and
a
fierce
race
of
savages
all
had
to
be
met
and
defeated
the
rifle
and
the
ax
are
the
symbols
of
the
backwoods
pioneer
they
meant
a
training
in
aggressive
courage
in
domination
in
directness
of
action
in
destructiveness
to
the
pioneer
the
forest
was
no
friendly
resource
for
posterity
no
object
of
careful
economy
he
must
wage
a
war
upon
it
cutting
and
burning
a
little
space
to
let
in
the
light
upon
a
dozen
acres
of
soil
and
year
after
year
expanding
the
clearing
into
new
woodlands
against
the
stubborn
resistance
of
primeval
trunks
and
matted
roots
he
made
war
against
the
rank
fertility
of
the
soil
while
new
worlds
of
virgin
land
lay
ever
just
beyond
it
was
idle
to
expect
the
pioneer
to
stay
his
hand
and
turn
to
scientific
farming
indeed
as
secretary
wilson
has
said
the
pioneer
would
in
that
case
have
raised
wheat
that
no
one
wanted
to
eat
corn
to
store
on
the
farm
and
cotton
not
worth
the
picking
thus
fired
with
the
ideal
of
subduing
the
wilderness
the
destroying
pioneer
fought
his
way
across
the
continent
masterful
and
wasteful
preparing
the
way
by
seeking
the
immediate
thing
rejoicing
in
rude
strength
and
wilful
achievement
but
even
this
backwoodsman
was
more
than
a
mere
destroyer
he
had
visions
he
was
finder
as
well
as
fighter
the
for
civilization
the
inventor
of
new
ways
although
rudyard
foreloper
deals
with
the
english
pioneer
in
lands
beneath
the
southern
cross
yet
the
poem
portrays
american
traits
as
well
the
gull
shall
whistle
in
his
wake
the
blind
wave
break
in
fire
he
shall
fulfill
god
utmost
will
unknowing
his
desire
and
he
shall
see
old
planets
pass
and
alien
stars
arise
and
give
the
gale
his
reckless
sail
in
shadow
of
new
skies
strong
lust
of
gear
shall
drive
him
out
and
hunger
arm
his
hand
to
wring
food
from
desert
nude
his
foothold
from
the
sand
his
neighbors
smoke
shall
vex
his
eyes
their
voices
break
his
rest
he
shall
go
forth
till
south
is
north
sullen
and
dispossessed
he
shall
desire
loneliness
and
his
desire
shall
bring
hard
on
his
heels
a
thousand
wheels
a
people
and
a
king
he
shall
come
back
on
his
own
track
and
by
his
scarce
cool
camp
there
shall
he
meet
the
roaring
street
the
derrick
and
the
stamp
for
he
must
blaze
a
nation
way
with
hatchet
and
with
brand
till
on
his
last
won
wilderness
an
empire
bulwarks
stand
this
quest
after
the
unknown
this
yearning
beyond
the
sky
line
where
the
strange
roads
go
down
is
of
the
very
essence
of
the
backwoods
pioneer
even
though
he
was
unconscious
of
its
spiritual
significance
the
pioneer
was
taught
in
the
school
of
experience
that
the
crops
of
one
area
would
not
do
for
a
new
frontier
that
the
scythe
of
the
clearing
must
be
replaced
by
the
reaper
of
the
prairies
he
was
forced
to
make
old
tools
serve
new
uses
to
shape
former
habits
institutions
and
ideas
to
changed
conditions
and
to
find
new
means
when
the
old
proved
inapplicable
he
was
building
a
new
society
as
well
as
breaking
new
soil
he
had
the
ideal
of
nonconformity
and
of
change
he
rebelled
against
the
conventional
besides
the
ideals
of
conquest
and
of
discovery
the
pioneer
had
the
ideal
of
personal
development
free
from
social
and
governmental
constraint
he
came
from
a
civilization
based
on
individual
competition
and
he
brought
the
conception
with
him
to
the
wilderness
where
a
wealth
of
resources
and
innumerable
opportunities
gave
it
a
new
scope
the
prizes
were
for
the
keenest
and
the
strongest
for
them
were
the
best
bottom
lands
the
finest
timber
tracts
the
best
the
richest
ore
beds
and
not
only
these
natural
gifts
but
also
the
opportunities
afforded
in
the
midst
of
a
forming
society
here
were
mill
sites
town
sites
transportation
lines
banking
centers
openings
in
the
law
in
politics
all
the
varied
chances
for
advancement
afforded
in
a
rapidly
developing
society
where
everything
was
open
to
him
who
knew
how
to
seize
the
opportunity
the
squatter
enforced
his
claim
to
lands
even
against
the
title
by
the
use
of
combinations
and
force
he
appealed
to
lynch
law
with
little
hesitation
he
was
impatient
of
any
governmental
restriction
upon
his
individual
right
to
deal
with
the
wilderness
in
our
own
day
we
sometimes
hear
of
congressmen
sent
to
jail
for
violating
land
laws
but
the
different
spirit
in
the
pioneer
days
may
be
illustrated
by
a
speech
of
delegate
sibley
of
minnesota
in
congress
in
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
became
the
state
first
governor
a
regent
of
its
university
president
of
its
historical
society
and
a
doctor
of
laws
of
princeton
we
may
assume
that
he
was
a
pillar
of
society
he
said
the
government
has
watched
its
public
domain
with
jealous
eye
and
there
are
now
enactments
upon
your
statute
books
aimed
at
the
trespassers
upon
it
which
should
be
expunged
as
a
disgrace
to
the
country
and
to
the
nineteenth
century
especially
is
he
pursued
with
unrelenting
severity
who
has
dared
to
break
the
silence
of
the
primeval
forest
by
the
blows
of
the
american
ax
the
hardy
lumberman
who
has
penetrated
to
the
remotest
wilds
of
the
northwest
to
drag
from
their
recesses
the
materials
for
building
up
towns
and
cities
in
the
great
valley
of
the
mississippi
has
been
particularly
marked
out
as
a
victim
after
enduring
all
the
privations
and
subjecting
himself
to
all
the
perils
incident
to
his
vocation
when
he
has
toiled
for
months
to
add
by
his
honest
labor
to
the
comfort
of
his
fellow
men
and
to
the
aggregate
wealth
of
the
nation
he
finds
himself
suddenly
in
the
clutches
of
the
law
for
trespassing
on
the
public
domain
the
proceeds
of
his
long
winter
work
are
reft
from
him
and
exposed
to
public
sale
for
the
benefit
of
his
paternal
government
and
the
object
of
this
oppression
and
wrong
is
further
harassed
by
vexatious
law
proceedings
against
him
sibley
protest
in
congress
against
these
outrages
by
which
the
northern
lumbermen
were
harassed
in
their
work
of
what
would
now
be
called
stealing
government
timber
aroused
no
protest
from
his
colleagues
no
president
called
this
congressman
an
undesirable
citizen
or
gave
him
over
to
the
courts
thus
many
of
the
pioneers
following
the
ideal
of
the
right
of
the
individual
to
rise
subordinated
the
rights
of
the
nation
and
posterity
to
the
desire
that
the
country
should
be
developed
and
that
the
individual
should
advance
with
as
little
interference
as
possible
squatter
doctrines
and
individualism
have
left
deep
traces
upon
american
conceptions
but
quite
as
deeply
fixed
in
the
pioneer
mind
as
the
ideal
of
individualism
was
the
ideal
of
democracy
he
had
a
passionate
hatred
for
aristocracy
monopoly
and
special
privilege
he
believed
in
simplicity
economy
and
in
the
rule
of
the
people
it
is
true
that
he
honored
the
successful
man
and
that
he
strove
in
all
ways
to
advance
himself
but
the
west
was
so
free
and
so
vast
the
barriers
to
individual
achievement
were
so
remote
that
the
pioneer
was
hardly
conscious
that
any
danger
to
equality
could
come
from
his
competition
for
natural
resources
he
thought
of
democracy
as
in
some
way
the
result
of
our
political
institutions
and
he
failed
to
see
that
it
was
primarily
the
result
of
the
free
lands
and
immense
opportunities
which
surrounded
him
occasional
statesmen
voiced
the
idea
that
american
democracy
was
based
on
the
abundance
of
unoccupied
land
even
in
the
first
debates
on
the
public
domain
this
early
recognition
of
the
influence
of
abundance
of
land
in
shaping
the
economic
conditions
of
american
democracy
is
peculiarly
significant
in
view
of
the
practical
exhaustion
of
the
supply
of
cheap
arable
public
lands
open
to
the
poor
man
and
the
coincident
development
of
labor
unions
to
keep
up
wages
certain
it
is
that
the
strength
of
democratic
movements
has
chiefly
lain
in
the
regions
of
the
pioneer
our
governments
tend
too
much
to
democracy
wrote
izard
of
south
carolina
to
jefferson
in
a
handicraftsman
thinks
an
apprenticeship
necessary
to
make
him
acquainted
with
his
business
but
our
backcountrymen
are
of
the
opinion
that
a
politician
may
be
born
just
as
well
as
a
poet
the
revolutionary
ideas
of
course
gave
a
great
impetus
to
democracy
and
in
substantially
every
colony
there
was
a
double
revolution
one
for
independence
and
the
other
for
the
overthrow
of
aristocratic
control
but
in
the
long
run
the
effective
force
behind
american
democracy
was
the
presence
of
the
practically
free
land
into
which
men
might
escape
from
oppression
or
inequalities
which
burdened
them
in
the
older
settlements
this
possibility
compelled
the
coastwise
states
to
liberalize
the
franchise
and
it
prevented
the
formation
of
a
dominant
class
whether
based
on
property
or
on
custom
among
the
pioneers
one
man
was
as
good
as
his
neighbor
he
had
the
same
chance
conditions
were
simple
and
free
economic
equality
fostered
political
equality
an
optimistic
and
buoyant
belief
in
the
worth
of
the
plain
people
a
devout
faith
in
man
prevailed
in
the
west
democracy
became
almost
the
religion
of
the
pioneer
he
held
with
passionate
devotion
the
idea
that
he
was
building
under
freedom
a
new
society
based
on
self
government
and
for
the
welfare
of
the
average
man
and
yet
even
as
he
proclaimed
the
gospel
of
democracy
the
pioneer
showed
a
vague
apprehension
lest
the
time
be
short
lest
equality
should
not
endure
lest
he
might
fall
behind
in
the
ascending
movement
of
western
society
this
led
him
on
in
feverish
haste
to
acquire
advantages
as
though
he
only
half
believed
his
dream
before
him
lies
a
boundless
continent
wrote
de
tocqueville
in
the
days
when
pioneer
democracy
was
triumphant
under
jackson
and
he
urges
forward
as
if
time
pressed
and
he
was
afraid
of
finding
no
room
for
his
exertions
even
while
jackson
lived
labor
leaders
and
speculative
thinkers
were
demanding
legislation
to
place
a
limit
on
the
amount
of
land
which
one
person
might
acquire
and
to
provide
free
farms
de
tocqueville
saw
the
signs
of
change
between
the
workman
and
the
master
he
said
there
are
frequent
relations
but
no
real
association
i
am
of
the
opinion
upon
the
whole
that
the
manufacturing
aristocracy
which
is
growing
up
under
our
eyes
is
one
of
the
harshest
which
ever
existed
in
the
world
if
ever
a
permanent
inequality
of
conditions
and
aristocracy
again
penetrate
into
the
world
it
may
be
predicted
that
this
is
the
gate
by
which
they
will
enter
but
the
sanative
influences
of
the
free
spaces
of
the
west
were
destined
to
ameliorate
condition
to
afford
new
hopes
and
new
faith
to
pioneer
democracy
and
to
postpone
the
problem
as
the
settlers
advanced
into
provinces
whose
area
dwarfed
that
of
the
older
sections
pioneer
democracy
itself
began
to
undergo
changes
both
in
its
composition
and
in
its
processes
of
expansion
at
the
close
of
the
civil
war
when
settlement
was
spreading
with
greatest
vigor
across
the
mississippi
the
railways
began
their
work
as
colonists
their
land
grants
from
the
government
amounting
altogether
by
to
an
area
five
times
that
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
demanded
purchasers
and
so
the
railroads
pioneered
the
way
for
the
pioneer
the
homestead
law
increased
the
tide
of
settlers
the
improved
farm
machinery
made
it
possible
for
him
to
go
boldly
out
on
to
the
prairie
and
to
deal
effectively
with
virgin
soil
in
farms
whose
cultivated
area
made
the
old
clearings
of
the
backwoodsman
seem
mere
garden
plots
two
things
resulted
from
these
conditions
which
profoundly
modified
pioneer
ideals
in
the
first
place
the
new
form
of
colonization
demanded
an
increasing
use
of
capital
and
the
rapidity
of
the
formation
of
towns
the
speed
with
which
society
developed
made
men
the
more
eager
to
secure
bank
credit
to
deal
with
the
new
west
this
made
the
pioneer
more
dependent
on
the
eastern
economic
forces
in
the
second
place
the
farmer
became
dependent
as
never
before
on
transportation
companies
in
this
speculative
movement
the
railroads
finding
that
they
had
pressed
too
far
in
advance
and
had
issued
stock
to
freely
for
their
earnings
to
justify
the
face
of
the
investment
came
into
collision
with
the
pioneer
on
the
question
of
rates
and
of
discriminations
the
greenback
movement
and
the
granger
movements
were
appeals
to
government
to
prevent
what
the
pioneer
thought
to
be
invasions
of
pioneer
democracy
as
the
western
settler
began
to
face
the
problem
of
magnitude
in
the
areas
he
was
occupying
as
he
began
to
adjust
his
life
to
the
modern
forces
of
capital
and
to
complex
productive
processes
as
he
began
to
see
that
go
where
he
would
the
question
of
credit
and
currency
of
transportation
and
distribution
in
general
conditioned
his
success
he
sought
relief
by
legislation
he
began
to
lose
his
primitive
attitude
of
individualism
government
began
to
look
less
like
a
necessary
evil
and
more
like
an
instrument
for
the
perpetuation
of
his
democratic
ideals
in
brief
the
defenses
of
the
pioneer
democrat
began
to
shift
from
free
land
to
legislation
from
the
ideal
of
individualism
to
the
ideal
of
social
control
through
regulation
by
law
he
had
no
sympathy
with
a
radical
reconstruction
of
society
by
the
revolution
of
socialism
even
his
alliances
with
the
movement
of
organized
labor
which
paralleled
that
of
organized
capital
in
the
east
were
only
but
he
was
becoming
alarmed
over
the
future
of
the
free
democratic
ideal
the
wisdom
of
his
legislation
it
is
not
necessary
to
discuss
here
the
essential
point
is
that
his
conception
of
the
right
of
government
to
control
social
process
had
undergone
a
change
he
was
coming
to
regard
legislation
as
an
instrument
of
social
construction
the
individualism
of
the
kentucky
pioneer
of
was
giving
way
to
the
populism
of
the
kansas
pioneer
of
the
later
days
of
pioneer
democracy
are
too
familiar
to
require
much
exposition
but
they
are
profoundly
significant
as
the
pioneer
doctrine
of
free
competition
for
the
resources
of
the
nation
revealed
its
tendencies
as
individual
corporation
and
trust
like
the
pioneer
turned
increasingly
to
legal
devices
to
promote
their
contrasting
ideals
the
natural
resources
were
falling
into
private
possession
tides
of
alien
immigrants
were
surging
into
the
country
to
replace
the
old
american
stock
in
the
labor
market
to
lower
the
standard
of
living
and
to
increase
the
pressure
of
population
upon
the
land
these
recent
foreigners
have
lodged
almost
exclusively
in
the
dozen
great
centers
of
industrial
life
and
there
they
have
accented
the
antagonisms
between
capital
and
labor
by
the
fact
that
the
labor
supply
has
become
increasingly
foreign
born
and
recruited
from
nationalities
who
arouse
no
sympathy
on
the
part
of
capital
and
little
on
the
part
of
the
general
public
class
distinctions
are
accented
by
national
prejudices
and
democracy
is
thereby
invaded
but
even
in
the
dull
brains
of
great
masses
of
these
unfortunates
from
southern
and
eastern
europe
the
idea
of
america
as
the
land
of
freedom
and
of
opportunity
to
rise
the
land
of
pioneer
democratic
ideals
has
found
lodgment
and
if
it
is
given
time
and
is
not
turned
into
revolutionary
lines
it
will
fructify
as
the
american
pioneer
passed
on
in
advance
of
this
new
tide
of
european
immigration
he
found
lands
increasingly
limited
in
place
of
the
old
lavish
opportunity
for
the
settler
to
set
his
stakes
where
he
would
there
were
frantic
rushes
of
thousands
of
eager
pioneers
across
the
line
of
newly
opened
indian
reservations
even
in
when
oklahoma
was
opened
to
settlement
twenty
thousand
settlers
crowded
at
the
boundaries
like
straining
athletes
waiting
the
bugle
note
that
should
start
the
race
across
the
line
great
crowds
gather
at
the
land
lotteries
of
the
government
as
the
remaining
fragments
of
the
public
domain
are
flung
to
hungry
settlers
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pioneers
from
the
middle
west
have
crossed
the
national
boundary
into
canadian
wheat
fields
eager
to
find
farms
for
their
children
although
under
an
alien
flag
and
finally
the
government
has
taken
to
itself
great
areas
of
arid
land
for
reclamation
by
costly
irrigation
projects
whereby
to
furnish
tracts
in
the
desert
to
settlers
under
careful
regulation
of
water
rights
the
government
supplies
the
capital
for
huge
irrigation
dams
and
reservoirs
and
builds
them
itself
it
owns
and
operates
quarries
coal
mines
and
timber
to
facilitate
this
work
it
seeks
the
remotest
regions
of
the
earth
for
crops
suitable
for
these
areas
it
analyzes
the
soils
and
tells
the
farmer
what
and
when
and
how
to
plant
it
has
even
considered
the
rental
to
manufacturers
of
the
surplus
water
electrical
and
steam
power
generated
in
its
irrigation
works
and
the
utilization
of
this
power
to
extract
nitrates
from
the
air
to
replenish
soils
the
pioneer
of
the
arid
regions
must
be
both
a
capitalist
and
the
protégé
of
the
government
consider
the
contrast
between
the
conditions
of
the
pioneers
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
this
period
of
development
three
hundred
years
ago
adventurous
englishmen
on
the
coast
of
virginia
began
the
attack
on
the
wilderness
three
years
ago
the
president
of
the
united
states
summoned
the
governors
of
states
to
deliberate
upon
the
danger
of
the
exhaustion
of
the
natural
resources
of
the
nation
the
pressure
of
population
upon
the
food
supply
is
already
felt
and
we
are
at
the
beginning
only
of
this
transformation
it
is
profoundly
significant
that
at
the
very
time
when
american
democracy
is
becoming
conscious
that
its
pioneer
basis
of
free
land
and
sparse
population
is
giving
way
it
is
also
brought
face
to
face
with
the
startling
outcome
of
its
old
ideals
of
individualism
and
exploitation
under
competition
uncontrolled
by
government
pioneer
society
itself
was
not
sufficiently
sophisticated
to
work
out
to
its
logical
result
the
conception
of
the
man
but
the
captains
of
industry
by
applying
squatter
doctrines
to
the
evolution
of
american
industrial
society
have
made
the
process
so
clear
that
he
who
runs
may
read
contests
imply
alliances
as
well
as
rivalries
the
increasing
magnitude
of
the
areas
to
be
dealt
with
and
the
occurrences
of
times
of
industrial
stress
furnished
occasion
for
such
unions
the
panic
of
was
followed
by
an
unprecedented
combination
of
individual
businesses
and
partnerships
into
corporations
the
panic
of
marked
the
beginning
of
an
extraordinary
development
of
corporate
combinations
into
pools
and
trusts
agreements
and
absorptions
until
by
the
time
of
the
panic
of
it
seemed
not
impossible
that
the
outcome
of
free
competition
under
individualism
was
to
be
monopoly
of
the
most
important
natural
resources
and
processes
by
a
limited
group
of
men
whose
vast
fortunes
were
so
invested
in
allied
and
dependent
industries
that
they
constituted
the
dominating
force
in
the
industrial
life
of
the
nation
the
development
of
large
scale
factory
production
the
benefit
of
combination
in
the
competitive
struggle
and
the
tremendous
advantage
of
concentration
in
securing
possession
of
the
unoccupied
opportunities
were
so
great
that
vast
accumulations
of
capital
became
the
normal
agency
of
the
industrial
world
in
almost
exact
ratio
to
the
diminution
of
the
supply
of
unpossessed
resources
combinations
of
capital
have
increased
in
magnitude
and
in
efficiency
of
conquest
the
solitary
backwoodsman
wielding
his
ax
at
the
edge
of
a
measureless
forest
is
replaced
by
companies
capitalized
at
millions
operating
railroads
sawmills
and
all
the
enginery
of
modern
machinery
to
harvest
the
remaining
trees
a
new
national
development
is
before
us
without
the
former
safety
valve
of
abundant
resources
open
to
him
who
would
take
classes
are
becoming
alarmingly
distinct
there
is
the
demand
on
the
one
side
voiced
by
harriman
so
well
and
by
others
since
that
nothing
must
be
done
to
interfere
with
the
early
pioneer
ideals
of
the
exploitation
and
the
development
of
the
country
wealth
that
restrictive
and
reforming
legislation
must
on
no
account
threaten
prosperity
even
for
a
moment
in
fact
we
sometimes
hear
in
these
days
from
men
of
influence
serious
doubts
of
democracy
and
intimations
that
the
country
would
be
better
off
if
it
freely
resigned
itself
to
guidance
by
the
geniuses
who
are
mastering
the
economic
forces
of
the
nation
and
who
it
is
alleged
would
work
out
the
prosperity
of
the
united
states
more
effectively
if
unvexed
by
politicians
and
people
on
the
other
hand
an
inharmonious
group
of
reformers
are
sounding
the
warning
that
american
democratic
ideals
and
society
are
menaced
and
already
invaded
by
the
very
conditions
that
make
this
apparent
prosperity
that
the
economic
resources
are
no
longer
limitless
and
free
that
the
aggregate
national
wealth
is
increasing
at
the
cost
of
present
social
justice
and
moral
health
and
the
future
of
the
american
people
the
granger
and
the
populist
were
prophets
of
this
reform
movement
bryan
democracy
debs
socialism
and
roosevelt
republicanism
all
had
in
common
the
emphasis
upon
the
need
of
governmental
regulation
of
industrial
tendencies
in
the
interest
of
the
common
man
the
checking
of
the
power
of
those
business
titans
who
emerged
successful
out
of
the
competitive
individualism
of
pioneer
america
as
land
values
rise
as
meat
and
bread
grow
dearer
as
the
process
of
industrial
consolidation
goes
on
and
as
eastern
industrial
conditions
spread
across
the
west
the
problems
of
traditional
american
democracy
will
become
increasingly
grave
the
time
has
come
when
university
men
may
well
consider
pioneer
ideals
for
american
society
has
reached
the
end
of
the
first
great
period
in
its
formation
it
must
survey
itself
reflect
upon
its
origins
consider
what
freightage
of
purposes
it
carried
in
its
long
march
across
the
continent
what
ambitions
it
had
for
the
man
what
rôle
it
would
play
in
the
world
how
shall
we
conserve
what
was
best
in
pioneer
ideals
how
adjust
the
old
conceptions
to
the
changed
conditions
of
modern
life
other
nations
have
been
rich
and
prosperous
and
powerful
but
the
united
states
has
believed
that
it
had
an
original
contribution
to
make
to
the
history
of
society
by
the
production
of
a
intelligent
democracy
it
is
in
the
middle
west
that
society
has
formed
on
lines
least
like
those
of
europe
it
is
here
if
anywhere
that
american
democracy
will
make
its
stand
against
the
tendency
to
adjust
to
a
european
type
this
consideration
gives
importance
to
my
final
topic
the
relation
of
the
university
to
pioneer
ideals
and
to
the
changing
conditions
of
american
democracy
president
pritchett
of
the
carnegie
foundation
has
recently
declared
that
in
no
other
form
of
popular
activity
does
a
nation
or
state
so
clearly
reveal
its
ideals
or
the
quality
of
its
civilization
as
in
its
system
of
education
and
he
finds
especially
in
the
state
university
a
conception
of
education
from
the
standpoint
of
the
whole
people
if
our
american
democracy
were
called
to
give
proof
of
its
constructive
ability
he
says
the
state
university
and
the
public
school
system
which
it
crowns
would
be
the
strongest
evidence
of
its
fitness
which
it
could
offer
it
may
at
least
be
conceded
that
an
essential
characteristic
of
the
state
university
is
its
democracy
in
the
largest
sense
the
provision
in
the
constitution
of
indiana
of
so
familiar
to
you
all
for
a
general
system
of
education
ascending
in
regular
gradations
from
township
schools
to
a
state
university
wherein
tuition
shall
be
gratis
and
equally
open
to
all
expresses
the
middle
western
conception
born
in
the
days
of
pioneer
society
and
doubtless
deeply
influenced
by
jeffersonian
democracy
the
most
obvious
fact
about
these
universities
perhaps
lies
in
their
integral
relation
with
the
public
schools
whereby
the
pupil
has
pressed
upon
him
the
question
whether
he
shall
go
to
college
and
whereby
the
road
is
made
open
and
direct
to
the
highest
training
by
this
means
the
state
offers
to
every
class
the
means
of
education
and
even
engages
in
propaganda
to
induce
students
to
continue
it
sinks
deep
shafts
through
the
social
strata
to
find
the
gold
of
real
ability
in
the
underlying
rock
of
the
masses
it
fosters
that
due
degree
of
individualism
which
is
implied
in
the
right
of
every
human
being
to
have
opportunity
to
rise
in
whatever
directions
his
peculiar
abilities
entitle
him
to
go
subordinate
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
it
keeps
the
avenues
of
promotion
to
the
highest
offices
the
highest
honors
open
to
the
humblest
and
most
obscure
lad
who
has
the
natural
gifts
at
the
same
time
that
it
aids
in
the
improvement
of
the
masses
nothing
in
our
educational
history
is
more
striking
than
the
steady
pressure
of
democracy
upon
its
universities
to
adapt
them
to
the
requirements
of
all
the
people
from
the
state
universities
of
the
middle
west
shaped
under
pioneer
ideals
have
come
the
fuller
recognition
of
scientific
studies
and
especially
those
of
applied
science
devoted
to
the
conquest
of
nature
the
breaking
down
of
the
traditional
required
curriculum
the
union
of
vocational
and
college
work
in
the
same
institution
the
development
of
agricultural
and
engineering
colleges
and
business
courses
the
training
of
lawyers
administrators
public
men
and
journalists
all
under
the
ideal
of
service
to
democracy
rather
than
of
individual
advancement
alone
other
universities
do
the
same
thing
but
the
head
springs
and
the
main
current
of
this
great
stream
of
tendency
come
from
the
land
of
the
pioneers
the
democratic
states
of
the
middle
west
and
the
people
themselves
through
their
boards
of
trustees
and
the
legislature
are
in
the
last
resort
the
court
of
appeal
as
to
the
directions
and
conditions
of
growth
as
well
as
have
the
fountain
of
income
from
which
these
universities
derive
their
existence
the
state
university
has
thus
both
a
peculiar
power
in
the
directness
of
its
influence
upon
the
whole
people
and
a
peculiar
limitation
in
its
dependence
upon
the
people
the
ideals
of
the
people
constitute
the
atmosphere
in
which
it
moves
though
it
can
itself
affect
this
atmosphere
herein
is
the
source
of
its
strength
and
the
direction
of
its
difficulties
for
to
fulfil
its
mission
of
uplifting
the
state
to
continuously
higher
levels
the
university
must
in
the
words
of
bryce
serve
the
time
without
yielding
to
it
it
must
recognize
new
needs
without
becoming
subordinate
to
the
immediately
practical
to
the
expedient
it
must
not
sacrifice
the
higher
efficiency
for
the
more
obvious
but
lower
efficiency
it
must
have
the
wisdom
to
make
expenditures
for
results
which
pay
manifold
in
the
enrichment
of
civilization
but
which
are
not
immediate
and
palpable
in
the
transitional
condition
of
american
democracy
which
i
have
tried
to
indicate
the
mission
of
the
university
is
most
important
the
times
call
for
educated
leaders
general
experience
and
information
are
inadequate
for
the
solution
of
the
problems
of
a
democracy
which
no
longer
owns
the
safety
fund
of
an
unlimited
quantity
of
untouched
resources
scientific
farming
must
increase
the
yield
of
the
field
scientific
forestry
must
economize
the
woodlands
scientific
experiment
and
construction
by
chemist
physicist
biologist
and
engineer
must
be
applied
to
all
of
nature
forces
in
our
complex
modern
society
the
test
tube
and
the
microscope
are
needed
rather
than
ax
and
rifle
in
this
new
ideal
of
conquest
the
very
discoveries
of
science
in
such
fields
as
public
health
and
manufacturing
processes
have
made
it
necessary
to
depend
upon
the
expert
and
if
the
ranks
of
experts
are
to
be
recruited
broadly
from
the
democratic
masses
as
well
as
from
those
of
larger
means
the
state
universities
must
furnish
at
least
as
liberal
opportunities
for
research
and
training
as
the
universities
based
on
private
endowments
furnish
it
needs
no
argument
to
show
that
it
is
not
to
the
advantage
of
democracy
to
give
over
the
training
of
the
expert
exclusively
to
privately
endowed
institutions
but
quite
as
much
in
the
field
of
legislation
and
of
public
life
in
general
as
in
the
industrial
world
is
the
expert
needed
the
industrial
conditions
which
shape
society
are
too
complex
problems
of
labor
finance
social
reform
too
difficult
to
be
dealt
with
intelligently
and
wisely
without
the
leadership
of
highly
educated
men
familiar
with
the
legislation
and
literature
on
social
questions
in
other
states
and
nations
by
training
in
science
in
law
politics
economics
and
history
the
universities
may
supply
from
the
ranks
of
democracy
administrators
legislators
judges
and
experts
for
commissions
who
shall
disinterestedly
and
intelligently
mediate
between
contending
interests
when
the
words
capitalistic
classes
and
the
proletariate
can
be
used
and
understood
in
america
it
is
surely
time
to
develop
such
men
with
the
ideal
of
service
to
the
state
who
may
help
to
break
the
force
of
these
collisions
to
find
common
grounds
between
the
contestants
and
to
possess
the
respect
and
confidence
of
all
parties
which
are
genuinely
loyal
to
the
best
american
ideals
the
signs
of
such
a
development
are
already
plain
in
the
expert
commissions
of
some
states
in
the
increasing
proportion
of
university
men
in
legislatures
in
the
university
men
influence
in
federal
departments
and
commissions
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
the
best
hope
of
intelligent
and
principled
progress
in
economic
and
social
legislation
and
administration
lies
in
the
increasing
influence
of
american
universities
by
sending
out
these
experts
by
furnishing
legislators
public
leaders
and
teachers
by
graduating
successive
armies
of
enlightened
citizens
accustomed
to
deal
dispassionately
with
the
problems
of
modern
life
able
to
think
for
themselves
governed
not
by
ignorance
by
prejudice
or
by
impulse
but
by
knowledge
and
reason
and
the
state
universities
will
safeguard
democracy
without
such
leaders
and
followers
democratic
reactions
may
create
revolutions
but
they
will
not
be
able
to
produce
industrial
and
social
progress
america
problem
is
not
violently
to
introduce
democratic
ideals
but
to
preserve
and
entrench
them
by
courageous
adaptation
to
new
conditions
educated
leadership
sets
bulwarks
against
both
the
passionate
impulses
of
the
mob
and
the
sinister
designs
of
those
who
would
subordinate
public
welfare
to
private
greed
lord
bacon
splendid
utterance
still
rings
true
the
learning
of
the
few
is
despotism
the
learning
of
the
many
is
liberty
and
intelligent
and
principled
liberty
is
fame
wisdom
and
power
there
is
a
danger
to
the
universities
in
this
very
opportunity
at
first
pioneer
democracy
had
scant
respect
for
the
expert
he
believed
that
a
fool
can
put
on
his
coat
better
than
a
wise
man
can
do
it
for
him
there
is
much
truth
in
the
belief
and
the
educated
leader
even
he
who
has
been
trained
under
present
university
conditions
in
direct
contact
with
the
world
about
him
will
still
have
to
contend
with
this
inherited
suspicion
of
the
expert
but
if
he
be
well
trained
and
worthy
of
his
training
if
he
be
endowed
with
creative
imagination
and
personality
he
will
make
good
his
leadership
a
more
serious
danger
will
come
when
the
universities
are
fully
recognized
as
powerful
factors
in
shaping
the
life
of
the
state
not
mere
cloisters
remote
from
its
life
but
an
influential
element
in
its
life
then
it
may
easily
happen
that
the
smoke
of
the
of
political
and
social
controversy
will
obscure
their
pure
air
that
efforts
will
be
made
to
stamp
out
the
exceptional
doctrine
and
the
exceptional
man
those
who
investigate
and
teach
within
the
university
walls
must
respond
to
the
injunction
of
the
church
lift
up
the
heart
to
high
thinking
and
impartial
search
for
the
unsullied
truth
in
the
interests
of
all
the
people
this
is
the
holy
grail
of
the
universities
that
they
may
perform
their
work
they
must
be
left
free
as
the
pioneer
was
free
to
explore
new
regions
and
to
report
what
they
find
for
like
the
pioneers
they
have
the
ideal
of
investigation
they
seek
new
horizons
they
are
not
tied
to
past
knowledge
they
recognize
the
fact
that
the
universe
still
abounds
in
mystery
that
science
and
society
have
not
crystallized
but
are
still
growing
and
need
their
pioneer
new
and
beneficent
discoveries
in
nature
new
and
beneficial
discoveries
in
the
processes
and
directions
of
the
growth
of
society
substitutes
for
the
vanishing
material
basis
of
pioneer
democracy
may
be
expected
if
the
university
pioneers
are
left
free
to
seek
the
trail
in
conclusion
the
university
has
a
duty
in
adjusting
pioneer
ideals
to
the
new
requirements
of
american
democracy
even
more
important
than
those
which
i
have
named
the
early
pioneer
was
an
individualist
and
a
seeker
after
the
undiscovered
but
he
did
not
understand
the
richness
and
complexity
of
life
as
a
whole
he
did
not
fully
realize
his
opportunities
of
individualism
and
discovery
he
stood
in
his
somber
forest
as
the
traveler
sometimes
stands
in
a
village
on
the
alps
when
the
mist
has
shrouded
everything
and
only
the
squalid
hut
the
stony
field
the
muddy
pathway
are
in
view
but
suddenly
a
wind
sweeps
the
fog
away
vast
fields
of
radiant
snow
and
sparkling
ice
lie
before
him
profound
abysses
open
at
his
feet
and
as
he
lifts
his
eyes
the
unimaginable
peak
of
the
matterhorn
cleaves
the
thin
air
far
far
above
a
new
and
unsuspected
world
is
revealed
all
about
him
thus
it
is
the
function
of
the
university
to
reveal
to
the
individual
the
mystery
and
the
glory
of
life
as
a
whole
to
open
all
the
realms
of
rational
human
enjoyment
and
achievement
to
preserve
the
consciousness
of
the
past
to
spread
before
the
eye
the
beauty
of
the
universe
and
to
throw
wide
its
portals
of
duty
and
of
power
to
the
human
soul
it
must
honor
the
poet
and
painter
the
writer
and
the
teacher
the
scientist
and
the
inventor
the
musician
and
the
prophet
of
righteousness
the
men
of
genius
in
all
fields
who
make
life
nobler
it
must
call
forth
anew
and
for
finer
uses
the
pioneer
love
of
creative
individualism
and
provide
for
it
a
spiritual
atmosphere
friendly
to
the
development
of
personality
in
all
uplifting
ways
it
must
check
the
tendency
to
act
in
mediocre
social
masses
with
undue
emphasis
upon
the
ideals
of
prosperity
and
politics
in
short
it
must
summon
ability
of
all
kinds
to
joyous
and
earnest
effort
for
the
welfare
and
the
spiritual
enrichment
of
society
it
must
awaken
new
tastes
and
ambitions
among
the
people
the
light
of
these
university
watch
towers
should
flash
from
state
to
state
until
american
democracy
itself
is
illuminated
with
higher
and
broader
ideals
of
what
constitutes
service
to
the
state
and
to
mankind
of
what
are
prizes
of
what
is
worthy
of
praise
and
reward
so
long
as
success
in
amassing
great
wealth
for
the
aggrandizement
of
the
individual
is
the
exclusive
or
the
dominant
standard
of
success
so
long
as
material
prosperity
regardless
of
the
conditions
of
its
cost
or
the
civilization
which
results
is
the
shibboleth
american
democracy
that
faith
in
the
common
man
which
the
pioneer
cherishes
is
in
danger
for
the
strongest
will
make
their
way
unerringly
to
whatever
goal
society
sets
up
as
the
mark
of
conceded
preëminence
what
more
effective

is
there
for
the

of
the

of
ideals
than
the
university
where
can
we
find
a
more
promising

of

the

clearing
must
be
broadened
into
a
domain
where
all
that
is
worthy

endeavor
may
find
fertile

the

the

its

from
the

of
work
in

to
take
stock

the

changed

less
apparent
perhaps
in
the

than
in

but
sufficiently
obvious
to
extend
the
commencement

from

the

as
a
whole

swift
and
inevitable
current

borne

to

necessary
to
determine

on
this
new
ocean
of
its
future
to
give
conscious
consideration
to
its
motive
power
and
to
its
steering
gear
it
matters
not
so
much
that
those
who
address
these
college
men
and
women
upon
life
give
conflicting
answers
to
the
questions
of
whence
and
whither
the
pause
for
remembrance
for
reflection
and
for
aspiration
is
wholesome
in
itself
although
the
american
people
are
becoming
more
more
responsive
to
the
appeal
to
act
by
deliberate
choices
we
should
be
if
we
believed
that
even
in
this
new
day
these
commencement
surveys
were
taken
to
heart
by
the
general
public
or
that
they
were
directly
and
immediately
influential
upon
national
thought
and
action
but
even
while
we
check
our
enthusiasm
by
this
realization
of
the
common
thought
we
must
take
heart
the
university
peculiar
privilege
and
distinction
lie
in
the
fact
that
it
is
not
the
passive
instrument
of
the
state
to
voice
its
current
ideas
its
problem
is
not
that
of
expressing
tendencies
its
mission
is
to
create
tendencies
and
to
direct
them
its
problem
is
that
of
leadership
and
of
ideals
it
is
called
of
course
to
justify
the
support
which
the
public
gives
it
by
working
in
close
and
sympathetic
touch
with
those
it
serves
more
than
that
it
would
lose
important
element
of
strength
if
it
failed
to
recognize
the
fact
that
improvement
and
creative
movement
often
come
from
the
masses
themselves
instinctively
moving
toward
a
better
order
the
university
graduates
must
be
fitted
to
take
their
places
naturally
and
effectually
in
the
common
life
of
the
time
but
the
university
is
called
especially
to
justify
its
existence
by
giving
to
its
sons
and
daughters
something
which
they
could
not
well
have
gotten
through
the
ordinary
experiences
of
the
life
outside
its
walls
it
is
called
to
serve
the
time
by
independent
research
and
by
original
thought
if
it
were
a
mere
recording
instrument
of
conventional
opinion
and
average
information
it
is
hard
to
see
why
the
university
should
exist
at
all
to
clasp
hands
with
the
common
life
in
order
that
it
may
lift
that
life
to
be
a
radiant
center
enkindling
the
society
in
which
it
has
its
being
these
are
primary
duties
of
the
university
fortunate
the
state
which
gives
free
play
to
this
spirit
of
inquiry
let
it
grubstake
its
intellectual
prospectors
and
send
them
forth
where
the
trails
run
out
and
stop
a
famous
scientist
holds
that
the
universal
ether
bears
vital
germs
which
impinging
upon
a
dead
world
would
bring
life
to
it
so
at
least
it
is
in
the
world
of
thought
where
energized
ideals
put
in
the
air
and
carried
here
and
there
by
the
waves
and
currents
of
the
intellectual
atmosphere
fertilize
vast
inert
areas
the
university
therefore
has
a
double
duty
on
the
one
hand
it
must
aid
in
the
improvement
of
the
general
economic
and
social
environment
it
must
help
on
in
the
work
of
scientific
discovery
and
of
making
such
conditions
of
existence
economic
political
and
social
as
will
produce
more
fertile
and
responsive
soil
for
a
higher
and
better
life
it
must
stimulate
a
wider
demand
on
the
part
of
the
public
for
right
leadership
it
must
extend
its
operations
more
widely
among
the
people
and
sink
deeper
shafts
through
social
strata
to
find
new
supplies
of
intellectual
gold
in
popular
levels
yet
untouched
and
on
the
other
hand
it
must
find
and
fit
men
and
women
for
leadership
it
must
both
awaken
new
demands
and
it
must
satisfy
those
demands
by
trained
leaders
with
new
motives
with
new
incentives
to
ambition
with
higher
and
broader
conception
of
what
constitute
the
prize
in
life
of
what
constitutes
success
the
university
has
to
deal
with
both
the
soil
and
sifted
seed
in
the
agriculture
of
the
human
spirit
its
efficiency
is
not
the
efficiency
which
the
business
engineer
is
fitted
to
appraise
if
it
is
a
training
ship
it
is
a
training
ship
bound
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
seeking
new
horizons
the
economy
of
the
university
consumption
can
only
be
rightly
measured
by
the
later
times
which
shall
possess
those
new
realms
of
the
spirit
which
its
voyage
shall
reveal
if
the
ships
of
columbus
had
engaged
in
a
profitable
coastwise

but
their
keels
would
never
have
grated
on
the
shores
of
a
new
world
the
appeal
of
the
undiscovered
is
strong
in
america
for
three
centuries
the
fundamental
process
in
its
history
was
the
westward
movement
the
discovery
and
occupation
of
the
vast
free
spaces
of
the
continent
we
are
the
first
generation
of
americans
who
can
look
back
upon
that
era
as
a
historic
movement
now
coming
to
its
end
other
generations
have
been
so
much
a
part
of
it
that
they
could
hardly
comprehend
its
significance
to
them
it
seemed
inevitable
the
free
land
and
the
natural
resources
seemed
practically
inexhaustible
nor
were
they
aware
of
the
fact
that
their
most
fundamental
traits
their
institutions
even
their
ideals
were
shaped
by
this
interaction
between
the
wilderness
and
themselves
american
democracy
was
born
of
no
theorist
dream
it
was
not
carried
in
the
to
virginia
nor
in
the
to
plymouth
it
came
out
of
the
american
forest
and
it
gained
new
strength
each
time
it
touched
a
new
frontier
not
the
constitution
but
free
land
and
an
abundance
of
natural
resources
open
to
a
fit
people
made
the
democratic
type
of
society
in
america
for
three
centuries
while
it
occupied
its
empire
we
are
looking
with
a
shock
upon
a
changed
world
the
national
problem
is
no
longer
how
to
cut
and
burn
away
the
vast
screen
of
the
dense
and
daunting
forest
it
is
how
to
save
and
wisely
use
the
remaining
timber
it
is
no
longer
how
to
get
the
great
spaces
of
fertile
prairie
land
in
humid
zones
out
of
the
hands
of
the
government
into
the
hands
of
the
pioneer
these
lands
have
already
passed
into
private
possession
no
longer
is
it
a
question
of
how
to
avoid
or
cross
the
great
plains
and
the
arid
desert
it
is
a
question
of
how
to
conquer
those
rejected
lands
by
new
method
of
farming
and
by
cultivating
new
crops
from
seed
collected
by
the
government
and
by
scientists
from
the
cold
dry
steppes
of
siberia
the
burning
sands
of
egypt
and
the
remote
interior
of
china
it
is
a
problem
of
how
to
bring
the
precious
rills
of
water
on
to
the
alkali
and
sage
brush
population
is
increasing
faster
than
the
food
supply
new
farm
lands
no
longer
increase
decade
after
decade
in
areas
equal
to
those
of
european
states
while
the
ratio
of
increase
of
improved
land
declines
the
value
of
farm
lands
rise
and
the
price
of
food
leaps
upward
reversing
the
old
ratio
between
the
two
the
cry
of
scientific
farming
and
the
conservation
of
natural
resources
replaces
the
cry
of
rapid
conquest
of
the
wilderness
we
have
so
far
won
our
national
home
wrested
from
it
its
first
rich
treasures
and
drawn
to
it
the
unfortunate
of
other
lands
that
we
are
already
obliged
to
compare
ourselves
with
settled
states
of
the
old
world
in
place
of
our
attitude
of
contemptuous
indifference
to
the
legislation
of
such
countries
as
germany
and
england
even
western
states
like
wisconsin
send
commissions
to
study
their
systems
of
taxation
workingmen
insurance
old
age
pensions
and
a
great
variety
of
other
remedies
for
social
ills
if
we
look
about
the
periphery
of
the
nation
everywhere
we
see
the
indications
that
our
world
is
changing
on
the
streets
of
northeastern
cities
like
new
york
and
boston
the
faces
which
we
meet
are
to
a
surprising
extent
those
of
southeastern
europe
puritan
new
england
which
turned
its
capital
into
factories
and
mills
and
drew
to
its
shores
an
army
of
cheap
labor
governed
these
people
for
a
time
by
a
ruling
class
like
an
upper
stratum
between
which
and
the
lower
strata
there
was
no
assimilation
there
was
no
such
evolution
into
an
assimilated
commonwealth
as
is
seen
in
middle
western
agricultural
states
where
immigrant
and
old
native
stock
came
in
together
and
built
up
a
homogeneous
society
on
the
principle
of
give
and
take
but
now
the
northeastern
coast
finds
its
destiny
politically
and
economically
passing
away
from
the
descendants
of
the
puritans
it
is
the
little
jewish
boy
the
greek
or
the
sicilian
who
takes
the
traveler
through
historic
streets
now
the
home
of
these
newer
people
to
the
old
north
church
or
to
paul
revere
house
or
to
tea
wharf
and
tells
you
in
his
strange
patois
the
story
of
revolution
against
oppression
along
the
southern
atlantic
and
the
gulf
coast
in
spite
of
the
preservative
influence
of
the
negro
whose
presence
has
always
called
out
resistance
to
change
on
the
part
of
the
whites
the
forces
of
social
and
industrial
transformation
are
at
work
the
old
tidewater
aristocracy
has
surrendered
to
the
democrats
along
the
line
of
the
alleghanies
like
an
advancing
column
the
forces
of
northern
capital
textile
and
steel
mills
year
after
year
extend
their
invasion
into
the
lower
south
new
orleans
once
the
mistress
of
the
commerce
of
the
mississippi
valley
is
awakening
to
new
dreams
of
world
commerce
on
the
southern
border
similar
invasions
of
american
capital
have
been
entering
mexico
at
the
same
time
the
opening
of
the
panama
canal
has
completed
the
dream
of
the
ages
of
the
straits
of
anian
between
atlantic
and
pacific
four
hundred
years
ago
balboa
raised
the
flag
of
spain
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
of
the
west
and
we
are
now
preparing
to
celebrate
both
that
anniversary
and
the
piercing
of
the
continent
new
relations
have
been
created
between
spanish
america
and
the
united
states
and
the
world
is
watching
the
mediation
of
argentina
brazil
and
chile
between
the
contending
forces
of
mexico
and
the
union
once
more
alien
national
interests
lie
threatening
at
our
borders
but
we
no
longer
appeal
to
the
monroe
doctrine
and
send
our
armies
of
frontiersmen
to
settle
our
concerns
we
take
council
with
european
nations
and
with
the
sisterhood
of
south
america
and
propose
a
remedy
of
social
reorganization
in
place
of
imperious
will
and
force
whether
the
effort
will
succeed
or
not
it
is
a
significant
indication
that
an
old
order
is
passing
away
when
such
a
solution
is
undertaken
by
a
president
of
scotch
presbyterian
stock
born
in
the
state
of
virginia
if
we
turn
to
the
northern
border
where
we
are
about
to
celebrate
a
century
of
peace
with
england
we
see
in
progress
like
a
belated
procession
of
our
own
history
the
spread
of
pioneers
the
opening
of
new
wildernesses
the
building
of
new
cities
the
growth
of
a
new
and
mighty
nation
that
old
american
advance
of
the
wheat
farmer
from
the
connecticut
to
the
mohawk
and
the
genesee
from
the
great
valley
of
pennsylvania
to
the
ohio
valley
and
the
prairies
of
the
middle
west
is
now
by
its
own
momentum
and
under
the
stimulus
of
canadian
homesteads
and
the
high
price
of
wheat
carried
across
the
national
border
to
the
once
lone
plains
where
the
hudson
bay
dog
trains
crossed
the
desolate
snows
of
the
wild
north
land
in
the
pacific
northwest
the
era
of
construction
has
not
ended
but
it
is
so
rapidly
in
progress
that
we
can
already
see
the
closing
of
the
age
of
the
pioneer
already
alaska
beckons
on
the
north
and
pointing
to
her
wealth
of
natural
resources
asks
the
nation
on
what
new
terms
the
new
age
will
deal
with
her
across
the
pacific
looms
asia
no
longer
a
remote
vision
and
a
symbol
of
the
unchanging
but
borne
as
by
mirage
close
to
our
shores
and
raising
grave
questions
of
the
common
destiny
of
the
people
of
the
ocean
the
dreams
of
benton
and
of
seward
of
a
regenerated
orient
when
the
long
march
of
westward
civilization
should
complete
its
circle
seem
almost
to
be
in
process
of
realization
the
age
of
the
pacific
ocean
begins
mysterious
and
unfathomable
in
its
meaning
for
our
own
future
turning
to
view
the
interior
we
see
the
same
picture
of
change
when
the
superintendent
of
the
census
in
declared
the
frontier
line
no
longer
traceable
the
beginning
of
the
rush
into
oklahoma
had
just
occurred
here
where
the
broken
fragments
of
indian
nations
from
the
east
had
been
gathered
and
where
the
wilder
tribes
of
the
southwest
were
being
settled
came
the
rush
of
the
pioneer
almost
at
a
blow
the
old
indian
territory
passed
away
populous
cities
came
into
being
and
it
was
not
long
before
gushing
oil
wells
made
a
new
era
of
sudden
wealth
the
farm
lands
of
the
middle
west
taken
as
free
homesteads
or
bought
for
a
mere
pittance
have
risen
so
in
value
that
the
original
owners
have
in
an
increasing
degree
either
sold
them
in
order
to
reinvest
in
the
newer
cheap
lands
of
the
west
or
have
moved
into
the
town
and
have
left
the
tillage
to
tenant
farmers
the
growth
of
absentee
ownership
of
the
soil
is
producing
a
serious
problem
in
the
former
centers
of
the
granger
and
the
populist
along
the
old
northwest
the
great
lakes
are
becoming
a
new
mediterranean
sea
joining
the
realms
of
wheat
and
iron
ore
at
one
end
with
the
coal
and
furnaces
of
the
forks
of
the
ohio
where
the
most
intense
and
center
of
industrial
energy
exists
city
life
like
that
of
the
east
manufactures
and
accumulated
capital
seem
to
be
reproducing
in
the
center
of
the
republic
the
tendencies
already
so
plain
on
the
atlantic
coast
across
the
great
plains
where
buffalo
and
indian
held
sway
successive
industrial
waves
are
passing
the
old
free
range
gave
place
to
the
ranch
the
ranch
to
the
homestead
and
now
in
places
in
the
arid
lands
the
homestead
is
replaced
by
the
ten
or
twenty
acre
irrigated
fruit
farm
the
age
of
cheap
land
cheap
corn
and
wheat
and
cheap
cattle
has
gone
forever
the
federal
government
has
undertaken
vast
paternal
enterprises
of
reclamation
of
the
desert
in
the
rocky
mountains
where
at
the
time
of
civil
war
the
first
important
rushes
to
gold
and
silver
mines
carried
the
frontier
backward
on
a
march
toward
the
east
the
most
amazing
transformations
have
occurred
here
where
prospectors
made
new
trails
and
lived
the
wild
free
life
of
mountain
men
here
where
the
human
spirit
seemed
likely
to
attain
the
largest
measure
of
individual
freedom
and
where
fortune
beckoned
to
the
common
man
have
come
revolutions
wrought
by
the
demand
for
organized
industry
and
capital
in
the
regions
where
the
popular
tribunal
and
the
free
competitive
life
flourished
we
have
seen
law
and
order
break
down
in
the
unmitigated
collision
of
great
aggregations
of
capital
with
each
other
and
with
organized
socialistic
labor
the
cripple
creek
strikes
the
contests
at
butte
the
goldfield
mobs
the
recent
colorado
fighting
all
tell
a
similar
story
the
solid
impact
of
contending
forces
in
regions
where
civic
power
and
loyalty
to
the
state
have
never
fully
developed
like
the
grand
cañon
where
in
dazzling
light
the
huge
geologic
history
is
written
so
large
that
none
may
fail
to
read
it
so
in
the
rocky
mountains
the
dangers
of
modern
american
industrial
tendencies
have
been
exposed
as
we
crossed
the
cascades
on
our
way
to
seattle
one
of
the
passengers
was
moved
to
explain
his
feeling
on
the
excellence
of
puget
sound
in
contrast
with
the
remaining
visible
universe
he
did
it
well
in
spite
of
irreverent
interruptions
from
those
fellow
travelers
who
were
unconverted
children
of
the
east
and
at
last
he
broke
forth
in
passionate
challenge
why
should
i
not
love
seattle
it
took
me
from
the
slums
of
the
atlantic
coast
a
poor
swedish
boy
with
hardly
fifteen
dollars
in
my
pocket
it
gave
me
a
home
by
the
beautiful
sea
it
spread
before
my
eyes
a
vision
of
peaks
and
smiling
fields
it
brought
abundance
and
a
new
life
to
me
and
my
children
and
i
love
it
i
love
it
if
i
were
a
i
would
charter
freight
cars
and
carry
away
from
the
crowded
tenements
and
noisome
alleys
of
the
eastern
cities
and
the
old
world
the
toiling
masses
and
let
them
loose
in
our
vast
forests
and
mountains
to
learn
what
life
really
is
and
my
heart
was
stirred
by
his
words
and
by
the
whirling
spaces
of
woods
and
peaks
through
which
we
passed
but
as
i
looked
and
listened
to
this
passionate
outcry
i
remembered
the
words
of
talleyrand
the
exiled
bishop
of
autun
in
administration
looking
down
from
an
eminence
not
far
from
philadelphia
upon
a
wilderness
which
is
now
in
the
heart
of
that
huge
industrial
society
where
population
presses
on
the
means
of
life
even
the
and
cynical
talleyrand
gazing
on
those
unpeopled
hills
and
forests
kindled
with
the
vision
of
coming
clearings
the
smiling
farms
and
grazing
herds
that
were
to
be
the
populous
towns
that
should
be
built
the
newer
and
finer
social
organization
that
should
there
arise
and
then
i
remembered
the
hall
in
harvard
museum
of
social
ethics
through
which
i
pass
to
my
lecture
room
when
i
speak
on
the
history
of
the
westward
movement
that
hall
is
covered
with
an
exhibit
of
the
work
in
pittsburgh
steel
mills
and
of
the
congested
tenements
its
charts
and
diagrams
tell
of
the
long
hours
of
work
the
death
rate
the
relation
of
typhoid
to
the
slums
the
gathering
of
the
poor
of
all
southeastern
europe
to
make
a
civilization
at
that
center
of
american
industrial
energy
and
vast
capital
that
is
a
social
tragedy
as
i
enter
my
lecture
room
through
that
hall
i
speak
of
the
young
washington
leading
his
virginia
frontiersmen
to
the
magnificent
forest
at
the
forks
of
the
ohio
where
braddock
and
his
men
carving
a
cross
on
the
wilderness
rim
were
struck
by
the
painted
savages
in
the
primeval
woods
huge
furnaces
belch
forth
perpetual
fires
and
huns
and
bulgars
poles
and
sicilians
struggle
for
a
chance
to
earn
their
daily
bread
and
live
a
brutal
and
degraded
life
irresistibly
there
rushed
across
my
mind
the
memorable
words
of
huxley
even
the
best
of
modern
civilization
appears
to
me
to
exhibit
a
condition
of
mankind
which
neither
embodies
any
worthy
ideal
nor
even
possesses
the
merit
of
stability
i
do
not
hesitate
to
express
the
opinion
that
if
there
is
no
hope
of
a
large
improvement
of
the
condition
of
the
greater
part
of
the
human
family
if
it
is
true
that
the
increase
of
knowledge
the
winning
of
a
greater
dominion
over
nature
which
is
its
consequence
and
the
wealth
which
follows
upon
that
dominion
are
to
make
no
difference
in
the
extent
and
the
intensity
of
want
with
its
concomitant
physical
and
moral
degradation
among
the
masses
of
the
people
i
should
hail
the
advent
of
some
kindly
comet
which
would
sweep
the
whole
affair
away
as
a
desirable
consummation
but
if
there
is
disillusion
and
shock
and
apprehension
as
we
come
to
realize
these
changes
to
strong
men
and
women
there
is
challenge
and
inspiration
in
them
too
in
place
of
old
frontiers
of
wilderness
there
are
new
frontiers
of
unwon
fields
of
science
fruitful
for
the
needs
of
the
race
there
are
frontiers
of
better
social
domains
yet
unexplored
let
us
hold
to
our
attitude
of
faith
and
courage
and
creative
zeal
let
us
dream
as
our
fathers
dreamt
and
let
us
make
our
dreams
come
true
daughters
of
time
the
hypocritic
days
muffled
and
dumb
like
barefoot
dervishes
and
marching
single
in
an
endless
file
bear
diadems
and
fagots
in
their
hands
to
each
they
offer
gifts
after
his
will
bread
kingdoms
stars
and
sky
that
hold
them
all
i
in
my
pleachéd
garden
watched
the
pomp
forgot
my
morning
wishes
hastily
took
a
few
herbs
and
apples
and
the
day
turned
and
departed
silent
i
too
late
under
her
solemn
fillet
saw
the
scorn
what
were
america
morning
wishes
from
the
beginning
of
that
long
westward
march
of
the
american
people
america
has
never
been
the
home
of
mere
contented
materialism
it
has
continuously
sought
new
ways
and
dreamed
of
a
perfected
social
type
in
the
fifteenth
century
when
men
dealt
with
the
new
world
which
columbus
found
the
ideal
of
discovery
was
dominant
here
was
placed
within
the
reach
of
men
whose
ideas
had
been
bounded
by
the
atlantic
new
realms
to
be
explored
america
became
the
land
of
european
dreams
its
fortunate
islands
were
made
real
where
in
the
imagination
of
old
europe
peace
and
happiness
as
well
as
riches
and
eternal
youth
were
to
be
found
to
sir
edwin
sandys
and
his
friends
of
the
london
company
virginia
offered
an
opportunity
to
erect
the
republic
for
which
they
had
longed
in
vain
in
england
to
the
puritans
new
england
was
the
new
land
of
freedom
wherein
they
might
establish
the
institutions
of
god
according
to
their
own
faith
as
the
vision
died
away
in
virginia
toward
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
taken
up
anew
by
the
fiery
bacon
with
his
revolution
to
establish
a
real
democracy
in
place
of
the
rule
of
the
planter
aristocracy
that
formed
along
the
coast
hardly
had
he
been
overthrown
when
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
democratic
ideal
was
rejuvenated
by
the
strong
frontiersmen
who
pressed
beyond
the
new
england
coast
into
the
berkshires
and
up
the
valleys
of
the
green
mountains
of
vermont
and
by
the
and
german
pioneers
who
followed
the
great
valley
from
pennsylvania
into
the
upland
south
in
both
the
yankee
frontiersmen
and
the
presbyterians
of
the
south
the
calvinistic
conception
of
the
importance
of
the
individual
bound
by
free
covenant
to
his
fellow
men
and
to
god
was
a
compelling
influence
and
all
their
wilderness
experience
combined
to
emphasize
the
ideals
of
opening
new
ways
of
giving
freer
play
to
the
individual
and
of
constructing
democratic
society
when
the
backwoodsmen
crossed
the
alleghanies
they
put
between
themselves
and
the
atlantic
coast
a
barrier
which
seemed
to
separate
them
from
a
region
already
too
much
like
the
europe
they
had
left
and
as
they
followed
the
courses
of
the
rivers
that
flowed
to
the
mississippi
they
called
themselves
men
of
the
western
waters
and
their
new
home
in
the
mississippi
valley
was
the
western
world
here
by
the
thirties
jacksonian
democracy
flourished
strong
in
the
faith
of
the
intrinsic
excellence
of
the
common
man
in
his
right
to
make
his
own
place
in
the
world
and
in
his
capacity
to
share
in
government
but
while
jacksonian
democracy
demanded
these
rights
it
was
also
loyal
to
leadership
as
the
very
name
implies
it
was
ready
to
follow
to
the
uttermost
the
man
in
whom
it
placed
its
trust
whether
the
hero
were
frontier
fighter
or
president
and
it
even
rebuked
and
limited
its
own
legislative
representatives
and
recalled
its
senators
when
they
ran
counter
to
their
chosen
executive
jacksonian
democracy
was
essentially
rural
it
was
based
on
the
good
fellowship
and
genuine
social
feeling
of
the
frontier
in
which
classes
and
inequalities
of
fortune
played
little
part
but
it
did
not
demand
equality
of
condition
for
there
was
abundance
of
natural
resources
and
the
belief
that
the
man
had
a
right
to
his
success
in
the
free
competition
which
western
life
afforded
was
as
prominent
in
their
thought
as
was
the
love
of
democracy
on
the
other
hand
they
viewed
governmental
restraints
with
suspicion
as
a
limitation
on
their
right
to
work
out
their
own
individuality
for
the
banking
institutions
and
capitalists
of
the
east
they
had
an
instinctive
antipathy
already
they
feared
that
the
money
power
as
jackson
called
it
was
planning
to
make
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
of
the
common
people
in
this
view
they
found
allies
among
the
labor
leaders
of
the
east
who
in
the
same
period
began
their
fight
for
better
conditions
of
the
wage
earner
these
locofocos
were
the
first
americans
to
demand
fundamental
social
changes
for
the
benefit
of
the
workers
in
the
cities
like
the
western
pioneers
they
protested
against
monopolies
and
special
privilege
but
they
also
had
a
constructive
policy
whereby
society
was
to
be
kept
democratic
by
free
gifts
of
the
public
land
so
that
surplus
labor
might
not
bid
against
itself
but
might
find
an
outlet
in
the
west
thus
to
both
the
labor
theorist
and
the
practical
pioneer
the
existence
of
what
seemed
inexhaustible
cheap
land
and
unpossessed
resources
was
the
condition
of
democracy
in
these
years
of
the
thirties
and
forties
western
democracy
took
on
its
distinctive
form
travelers
like
de
tocqueville
and
harriet
martineau
came
to
study
and
to
report
it
enthusiastically
to
europe
side
by
side
with
this
westward
marching
army
of
individualistic
democratic
backwoodsmen
went
a
more
northern
stream
of
pioneers
who
cherished
similar
ideas
but
added
to
them
the
desire
to
create
new
industrial
centers
to
build
up
factories
to
build
railroads
and
to
develop
the
country
by
founding
cities
and
extending
prosperity
they
were
ready
to
call
upon
legislatures
to
aid
in
this
by
subscriptions
to
stock
grants
of
franchises
promotion
of
banking
and
internal
improvements
these
were
the
whig
followers
of
that
other
western
leader
henry
clay
and
their
early
strength
lay
in
the
ohio
valley
and
particularly
among
the
in
the
south
their
strength
was
found
among
the
aristocracy
of
the
cotton
kingdom
both
of
these
western
groups
whigs
and
democrats
alike
had
one
common
ideal
the
desire
to
leave
their
children
a
better
heritage
than
they
themselves
had
received
and
both
were
fired
with
devotion
to
the
ideal
of
creating
in
this
new
world
a
home
more
worthy
of
mankind
both
were
ready
to
break
with
the
past
to
boldly
strike
out
new
lines
of
social
endeavor
and
both
believed
in
american
expansion
before
these
tendencies
had
worked
themselves
out
three
new
forces
entered
in
the
sudden
extension
of
our
boundaries
to
the
pacific
coast
which
took
place
in
the
forties
the
nation
won
so
vast
a
domain
that
its
resources
seemed
illimitable
and
its
society
seemed
able
to
throw
off
all
its
maladies
by
the
very
presence
of
these
vast
new
spaces
at
the
same
period
the
great
activity
of
railroad
building
to
the
mississippi
valley
occurred
making
these
lands
available
and
diverting
attention
to
the
task
of
economic
construction
the
third
influence
was
the
slavery
question
which
becoming
acute
shaped
the
american
ideals
and
public
discussion
for
nearly
a
generation
viewed
from
one
angle
this
struggle
involved
the
great
question
of
national
unity
from
another
it
involved
the
question
of
the
relations
of
labor
and
capital
democracy
and
aristocracy
it
was
not
without
significance
that
abraham
lincoln
became
the
very
type
of
american
pioneer
democracy
the
first
adequate
and
elemental
demonstration
to
the
world
that
that
democracy
could
produce
a
man
who
belonged
to
the
ages
after
the
war
new
national
energies
were
set
loose
and
new
construction
and
development
engaged
the
attention
of
the
westerners
as
they
occupied
prairies
and
great
plains
and
mountains
democracy
and
capitalistic
development
did
not
seem
antagonistic
with
the
passing
of
the
frontier
western
social
and
political
ideals
took
new
form
capital
began
to
consolidate
in
even
greater
masses
and
increasingly
attempted
to
reduce
to
system
and
control
the
processes
of
industrial
development
labor
with
equal
step
organized
its
forces
to
destroy
the
old
competitive
system
it
is
not
strange
that
the
western
pioneers
took
alarm
for
their
ideals
of
democracy
as
the
outcome
of
the
free
struggle
for
the
national
resources
became
apparent
they
espoused
the
cause
of
governmental
activity
it
was
a
new
gospel
for
the
western
radical
became
convinced
that
he
must
sacrifice
his
ideal
of
individualism
and
free
competition
in
order
to
maintain
his
ideal
of
democracy
under
this
conviction
the
populist
revised
the
pioneer
conception
of
government
he
saw
in
government
no
longer
something
outside
of
him
but
the
people
themselves
shaping
their
own
affairs
he
demanded
therefore
an
extension
of
the
powers
of
governments
in
the
interest
of
his
historic
ideal
of
democratic
society
he
demanded
not
only
free
silver
but
the
ownership
of
the
agencies
of
communication
and
transportation
the
income
tax
the
postal
savings
bank
the
provision
of
means
of
credit
for
agriculture
the
construction
of
more
effective
devices
to
express
the
will
of
the
people
primary
nominations
direct
elections
initiative
referendum
and
recall
in
a
word
capital
labor
and
the
western
pioneer
all
deserted
the
ideal
of
competitive
individualism
in
order
to
organize
their
interests
in
more
effective
combinations
the
disappearance
of
the
frontier
the
closing
of
the
era
which
was
marked
by
the
influence
of
the
west
as
a
form
of
society
brings
with
it
new
problems
of
social
adjustment
new
demands
for
considering
our
past
ideals
and
our
present
needs
let
us
recall
the
conditions
of
the
foreign
relations
along
our
borders
the
dangers
that
wait
us
if
we
fail
to
unite
in
the
solution
of
our
domestic
problems
let
us
recall
those
internal
evidences
of
the
destruction
of
our
old
social
order
if
we
take
to
heart
this
warning
we
shall
do
well
also
to
recount
our
historic
ideals
to
take
stock
of
those
purposes
and
fundamental
assumptions
that
have
gone
to
make
the
american
spirit
and
the
meaning
of
america
in
world
history
first
of
all
there
was
the
ideal
of
discovery
the
courageous
determination
to
break
new
paths
indifference
to
the
dogma
that
because
an
institution
or
a
condition
exists
it
must
remain
all
american
experience
has
gone
to
the
making
of
the
spirit
of
innovation
it
is
in
the
blood
and
will
not
be
repressed
then
there
was
the
ideal
of
democracy
the
ideal
of
a
free
people
responsive
to
leadership
in
the
forming
of
programs
and
their
execution
but
insistent
that
the
procedure
should
be
that
of
free
choice
not
of
compulsion
but
there
was
also
the
ideal
of
individualism
this
democratic
society
was
not
a
disciplined
army
where
all
must
keep
step
and
where
the
collective
interests
destroyed
individual
will
and
work
rather
it
was
a
mobile
mass
of
freely
circulating
atoms
each
seeking
its
own
place
and
finding
play
for
its
own
powers
and
for
its
own
original
initiative
we
can
not
lay
too
much
stress
upon
this
point
for
it
was
at
the
very
heart
of
the
whole
american
movement
the
world
was
to
be
made
a
better
world
by
the
example
of
a
democracy
in
which
there
was
freedom
of
the
individual
in
which
there
was
the
vitality
and
mobility
productive
of
originality
and
variety
bearing
in
mind
the
influence
of
the
disappearance
of
unlimited
resources
open
to
all
men
for
the
taking
and
considering
the
recoil
of
the
common
man
when
he
saw
the
outcome
of
the
competitive
struggle
for
these
resources
as
the
supply
came
to
its
end
over
most
of
the
nation
we
can
understand
the
reaction
against
individualism
and
in
favor
of
drastic
assertion
of
the
powers
of
government
legislation
is
taking
the
place
of
the
free
lands
as
the
means
of
preserving
the
ideal
of
democracy
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
endangering
the
other
pioneer
ideal
of
creative
and
competitive
individualism
both
were
essential
and
constituted
what
was
best
in
america
contribution
to
history
and
to
progress
both
must
be
preserved
if
the
nation
would
be
true
to
its
past
and
would
fulfil
its
highest
destiny
it
would
be
a
grave
misfortune
if
these
people
so
rich
in
experience
in
and
aspiration
in
creative
genius
should
turn
to
some
old
world
discipline
of
socialism
or
plutocracy
or
despotic
rule
whether
by
class
or
by
dictator
nor
shall
we
be
driven
to
these
alternatives
our
ancient
hopes
our
courageous
faith
our
underlying
good
humor
and
love
of
fair
play
will
triumph
in
the
end
there
will
be
give
and
take
in
all
directions
there
will
be
disinterested
leadership
under
loyalty
to
the
best
american
ideals
nowhere
is
this
leadership
more
likely
to
arise
than
among
the
men
trained
in
the
universities
aware
of
the
promise
of
the
past
and
the
possibilities
of
the
future
the
times
call
for
new
ambitions
and
new
motives
in
a
most
suggestive
essay
on
the
problems
of
modern
democracy
godkin
has
said
de
tocqueville
and
all
his
followers
take
it
for
granted
that
the
great
incentive
to
excellence
in
all
countries
in
which
excellence
is
found
is
the
patronage
and
encouragement
of
an
aristocracy
that
democracy
is
generally
content
with
mediocrity
but
where
is
the
proof
of
this
the
incentive
to
exertion
which
is
widest
most
constant
and
most
powerful
in
its
operations
in
all
civilized
countries
is
the
desire
of
distinction
and
this
may
be
composed
either
of
love
of
fame
or
love
of
wealth
or
of
both
in
literary
and
artistic
and
scientific
pursuits
sometimes
the
strongest
influence
is
exerted
by
a
love
of
the
subject
but
it
may
safely
be
said
that
no
man
has
ever
labored
in
any
of
the
higher
colleges
to
whom
the
applause
and
appreciation
of
his
fellows
was
not
one
of
the
sweetest
rewards
of
his
exertions
what
is
there
we
would
ask
in
the
nature
of
democratic
institutions
that
should
render
this
great
spring
of
action
powerless
that
should
deprive
glory
of
all
radiance
and
put
ambition
to
sleep
is
it
not
notorious
on
the
contrary
that
one
of
the
most
marked
peculiarities
of
democratic
society
or
of
a
society
drifting
toward
democracy
is
the
fire
of
competition
which
rages
in
it
the
fevered
anxiety
which
possesses
all
its
members
to
rise
above
the
dead
level
to
which
the
law
is
ever
seeking
to
confine
them
and
by
some
brilliant
stroke
become
something
higher
and
more
remarkable
than
their
fellows
the
secret
of
that
great
restlessness
which
is
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
accompaniments
of
life
in
democratic
countries
is
in
fact
due
to
the
eagerness
of
everybody
to
grasp
the
prizes
of
which
in
aristocratic
countries
only
the
few
have
much
chance
and
in
no
other
society
is
success
more
worshiped
is
distinction
of
any
kind
more
widely
flattered
and
caressed
in
democratic
societies
in
fact
excellence
is
the
first
title
to
distinction
in
aristocratic
ones
there
are
two
or
three
others
which
are
far
stronger
and
which
must
be
stronger
or
aristocracy
could
not
exist
the
moment
you
acknowledge
that
the
highest
social
position
ought
to
be
the
reward
of
the
man
who
has
the
most
talent
you
make
aristocratic
institutions
impossible
all
that
was
buoyant
and
creative
in
american
life
would
be
lost
if
we
gave
up
the
respect
for
distinct
personality
and
variety
in
genius
and
came
to
the
dead
level
of
common
standards
to
be
socialized
into
an
average
and
placed
under
the
tutelage
of
the
mass
of
us
as
a
recent
writer
has
put
it
would
be
an
irreparable
loss
nor
is
it
necessary
in
a
democracy
as
these
words
of
godkin
well
disclose
what
is
needed
is
the
multiplication
of
motives
for
ambition
and
the
opening
of
new
lines
of
achievement
for
the
strongest
as
we
turn
from
the
task
of
the
first
rough
conquest
of
the
continent
there
lies
before
us
a
whole
wealth
of
unexploited
resources
in
the
realm
of
the
spirit
arts
and
letters
science
and
better
social
creation
loyalty
and
political
service
to
the
commonweal
these
and
a
thousand
other
directions
of
activity
are
open
to
the
men
who
formerly
under
the
incentive
of
attaining
distinction
by
amassing
extraordinary
wealth
saw
success
only
in
material
display
newer
and
finer
careers
will
open
to
the
ambitious
when
once
public
opinion
shall
award
the
laurels
to
those
who
rise
above
their
fellows
in
these
new
fields
of
labor
it
has
not
been
the
gold
but
the
getting
of
the
gold
that
has
caught
the
imaginations
of
our
captains
of
industry
their
real
enjoyment
lay
not
in
the
luxuries
which
wealth
brought
but
in
the
work
of
construction
and
in
the
place
which
society
awarded
them
a
new
era
will
come
if
schools
and
universities
can
only
widen
the
intellectual
horizon
of
the
people
help
to
lay
the
foundations
of
a
better
industrial
life
show
them
new
goals
for
endeavor
inspire
them
with
more
varied
and
higher
ideals
the
western
spirit
must
be
invoked
for
new
and
nobler
achievements
of
that
matured
western
spirit

social
forces
in
american
history
the
transformations
through
which
the
united
states
is
passing
in
our
own
day
are
so
profound
so
that
it
is
hardly
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
we
are
witnessing
the
birth
of
a
new
nation
in
america
the
revolution
in
the
social
and
economic
structure
of
this
country
during
the
past
two
decades
is
comparable
to
what
occurred
when
independence
was
declared
and
the
constitution
was
formed
or
to
the
changes
wrought
by
the
era
which
began
half
a
century
ago
the
era
of
civil
war
and
reconstruction
these
changes
have
been
long
in
preparation
and
are
in
part
the
result
of
forces
of
reorganization
incident
to
the
age
of
steam
production
and
industry
and
in
part
the
result
of
the
closing
of
the
period
of
the
colonization
of
the
west
they
have
been
prophesied
and
the
course
of
the
movement
partly
described
by
students
of
american
development
but
after
all
it
is
with
a
shock
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
coming
to
realize
that
the
fundamental
forces
which
have
shaped
their
society
up
to
the
present
are
disappearing
twenty
years
ago
as
i
have
before
had
occasion
to
point
out
the
superintendent
of
the
census
declared
that
the
frontier
line
which
its
maps
had
depicted
for
decade
after
decade
of
the
westward
march
of
the
nation
could
no
longer
be
described
we
must
add
that
the
age
of
free
competition
of
individuals
for
the
unpossessed
resources
of
the
nation
is
nearing
its
end
it
is
taking
less
than
a
generation
to
write
the
chapter
which
began
with
the
disappearance
of
the
line
of
the
frontier
the
last
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
colonization
of
the
united
states
the
conclusion
to
the
annals
of
its
pioneer
democracy
it
is
a
wonderful
chapter
this
final
rush
of
american
energy
upon
the
remaining
wilderness
even
the
bare
statistics
become
eloquent
of
a
new
era
they
no
longer
derive
their
significance
from
the
exhibit
of
vast
proportions
of
the
public
domain
transferred
to
agriculture
of
wildernesses
equal
to
european
nations
changed
decade
after
decade
into
the
farm
area
of
the
united
states
it
is
true
there
was
added
to
the
farms
of
the
nation
between
and
a
territory
equal
to
that
of
france
and
between
and
a
territory
equal
to
the
european
area
of
france
germany
england
and
wales
combined
the
records
of
are
not
yet
available
but
whatever
they
reveal
they
will
not
be
so
full
of
meaning
as
the
figures
which
tell
of
upleaping
wealth
and
organization
and
concentration
of
industrial
power
in
the
east
in
the
last
decade
as
the
final
provinces
of
the
western
empire
have
been
subdued
to
the
purposes
of
civilization
and
have
yielded
their
spoils
as
the
spheres
of
operation
of
the
great
industrial
corporations
have
extended
with
the
extension
of
american
settlement
production
and
wealth
have
increased
beyond
all
precedent
the
total
deposits
in
all
national
banks
have
more
than
trebled
in
the
present
decade
the
money
in
circulation
has
doubled
since
the
flood
of
gold
makes
it
difficult
to
gage
the
full
meaning
of
the
incredible
increase
in
values
for
in
the
decade
ending
with
over
ounces
of
gold
were
mined
in
the
united
states
alone
over
four
million
ounces
have
been
produced
every
year
since
whereas
between
and
no
year
showed
a
production
of
two
million
ounces
as
a
result
of
this
swelling
stream
of
gold
and
instruments
of
credit
aided
by
a
variety
of
other
causes
prices
have
risen
until
their
height
has
become
one
of
the
most
marked
features
and
influential
factors
in
american
life
producing
social
readjustments
and
contributing
effectively
to
party
revolutions
but
if
we
avoid
those
statistics
which
require
analysis
because
of
the
changing
standard
of
value
we
still
find
that
the
decade
occupies
an
exceptional
place
in
american
history
more
coal
was
mined
in
the
united
states
in
the
ten
years
after
than
in
all
the
life
of
the
nation
before
that
time
fifty
years
ago
we
mined
less
than
fifteen
million
long
tons
of
coal
in
we
mined
nearly
at
the
present
rate
it
is
estimated
that
the
supply
of
coal
would
be
exhausted
at
a
date
no
farther
in
the
future
than
the
formation
of
the
constitution
is
in
the
past
iron
and
coal
are
the
measures
of
industrial
power
the
nation
has
produced
three
times
as
much
iron
ore
in
the
past
two
decades
as
in
all
its
previous
history
the
production
of
the
past
ten
years
was
more
than
double
that
of
the
prior
decade
production
is
admitted
to
be
an
excellent
barometer
of
manufacture
and
of
transportation
never
until
had
this
reached
an
annual
total
of
ten
million
long
tons
but
in
the
five
years
beginning
with
it
averaged
over
twice
that
by
the
united
states
had
surpassed
great
britain
germany
and
france
combined
in
the
production
of
and
steel
together
and
in
the
same
decade
a
single
great
corporation
has
established
its
domination
over
the
iron
mines
and
steel
manufacture
of
the
united
states
it
is
more
than
a
mere
accident
that
the
united
states
steel
corporation
with
its
stocks
and
bonds
aggregating
was
organized
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
decade
the
former
wilderness
about
lake
superior
has
principally
in
the
past
two
decades
established
its
position
as
overwhelmingly
the
preponderant
source
of
iron
ore
present
and
prospective
in
the
united
states
a
treasury
from
which
pittsburgh
has
drawn
wealth
and
extended
its
unparalleled
industrial
empire
in
these
years
the
tremendous
energies
thus
liberated
at
this
center
of
industrial
power
in
the
united
states
revolutionized
methods
of
manufacture
in
general
and
in
many
indirect
ways
profoundly
influenced
the
life
of
the
nation
railroad
statistics
also
exhibit
unprecedented
development
the
formation
of
a
new
industrial
society
the
number
of
passengers
carried
one
mile
more
than
doubled
between
and
freight
carried
one
mile
has
nearly
trebled
in
the
same
period
and
has
doubled
in
the
past
decade
agricultural
products
tell
a
different
story
the
corn
crop
has
only
risen
from
about
two
billion
bushels
in
to
two
and
billions
in
wheat
from
six
hundred
and
eleven
million
bushels
in
to
only
seven
hundred
and
million
in
and
cotton
from
about
nine
million
bales
in
to
ten
and
million
bales
in
population
has
increased
in
the
united
states
proper
from
about
and
millions
in
to
and
millions
in
and
to
over
ninety
millions
in
it
is
clear
from
these
statistics
that
the
ratio
of
the
increased
production
of
immediate
wealth
by
the
enormously
increased
exploitation
of
its
remaining
natural
resources
vastly
exceeds
the
ratio
of
increase
of
population
and
still
more
strikingly
exceeds
the
ratio
of
increase
of
agricultural
products
already
population
is
pressing
upon
the
food
supply
while
capital
consolidates
in
organizations
the
triumphant
democracy
whose
achievements
the
celebrated
has
reached
a
stature
even
more
imposing
than
he
could
have
foreseen
but
still
less
did
he
perceive
the
changes
in
democracy
itself
and
the
conditions
of
its
life
which
have
accompanied
this
material
growth
having
colonized
the
far
west
having
mastered
its
internal
resources
the
nation
turned
at
the
conclusion
of
the
nineteenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
to
deal
with
the
far
east
to
engage
in
the
of
the
pacific
ocean
having
continued
its
historic
expansion
into
the
lands
of
the
old
spanish
empire
by
the
successful
outcome
of
the
recent
war
the
united
states
became
the
mistress
of
the
philippines
at
the
same
time
that
it
came
into
possession
of
the
hawaiian
islands
and
the
controlling
influence
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
provided
early
in
the
present
decade
for
connecting
its
atlantic
and
pacific
coasts
by
the
isthmian
canal
and
became
an
imperial
republic
with
dependencies
and
protectorates
admittedly
a
new
with
a
potential
voice
in
the
problems
of
europe
asia
and
africa
this
extension
of
power
this
undertaking
of
grave
responsibilities
in
new
fields
this
entry
into
the
sisterhood
of
was
no
isolated
event
it
was
indeed
in
some
respects
the
logical
outcome
of
the
nation
march
to
the
pacific
the
sequence
to
the
era
in
which
it
was
engaged
in
occupying
the
free
lands
and
exploiting
the
resources
of
the
west
when
it
had
achieved
this
position
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
the
united
states
found
itself
confronted
also
with
the
need
of
constitutional
readjustment
arising
from
the
relations
of
federal
government
and
territorial
acquisitions
it
was
obliged
to
reconsider
questions
of
the
rights
of
man
and
traditional
american
ideals
of
liberty
and
democracy
in
view
of
the
task
of
government
of
other
races
politically
inexperienced
and
undeveloped
if
we
turn
to
consider
the
effect
upon
american
society
and
domestic
policy
in
these
two
decades
of
transition
we
are
met
with
palpable
evidences
of
the
invasion
of
the
old
pioneer
democratic
order
obvious
among
them
is
the
effect
of
unprecedented
immigration
to
supply
the
mobile
army
of
cheap
labor
for
the
centers
of
industrial
life
in
the
past
ten
years
beginning
with
over
eight
million
immigrants
have
arrived
the
newcomers
of
the
eight
years
since
would
according
to
a
writer
in
repopulate
all
the
five
older
new
england
states
as
they
stand
or
if
properly
disseminated
over
the
newer
parts
of
the
country
they
would
serve
to
populate
no
less
than
nineteen
states
of
the
union
as
they
stand
in
there
were
one
and
million
arrivals
this
number
would
entirely
populate
both
new
hampshire
and
maine
two
of
our
oldest
states
the
arrivals
of
this
one
year
would
found
a
state
with
more
inhabitants
than
any
one
of
of
our
other
existing
commonwealths
which
could
be
named
not
only
has
the
addition
to
the
population
from
europe
been
thus
extraordinary
it
has
come
in
increasing
measure
from
southern
and
eastern
europe
for
the
year
professor
ripley
whom
i
am
quoting
has
redistributed
the
incomers
on
the
basis
of
physical
type
and
finds
that
of
them
were
of
the
mediterranean
race
of
the
slavic
race
jewish
and
only
of
the
alpine
and
of
the
teutonic
in
germans
had
come
to
the
amount
of
in
they
were
replaced
by
south
italians
thus
it
is
evident
that
the
ethnic
elements
of
the
united
states
have
undergone
startling
changes
and
instead
of
spreading
over
the
nation
these
immigrants
have
concentrated
especially
in
the
cities
and
great
industrial
centers
in
the
past
decade
the
composition
of
the
labor
class
and
its
relation
to
wages
and
to
the
native
american
employer
have
been
deeply
influenced
thereby
the
sympathy
of
the
employers
with
labor
has
been
unfavorably
affected
by
the
pressure
of
great
numbers
of
immigrants
of
alien
nationality
and
of
lower
standards
of
life
the
familiar
facts
of
the
massing
of
population
in
the
cities
and
the
contemporaneous
increase
of
urban
power
and
of
the
massing
of
capital
and
production
in
fewer
and
vastly
greater
industrial
units
especially
attest
the
revolution
it
is
a
proposition
too
plain
to
require
elucidation
wrote
richard
rush
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
report
of
that
the
creation
of
capital
is
retarded
rather
than
accelerated
by
the
diffusion
of
a
thin
population
over
a
great
surface
of
soil
thirty
years
before
rush
wrote
these
words
albert
gallatin
declared
in
congress
that
if
the
cause
of
the
happiness
of
this
country
were
examined
into
it
would
be
found
to
arise
as
much
from
the
great
plenty
of
land
in
proportion
to
the
inhabitants
which
their
citizens
enjoyed
as
from
the
wisdom
of
their
political
institutions
possibly
both
of
these
pennsylvania
financiers
were
right
under
the
conditions
of
the
time
but
it
is
at
least
significant
that
capital
and
labor
entered
upon
a
new
era
as
the
end
of
the
free
lands
approached
a
contemporary
of
gallatin
in
congress
had
replied
to
the
argument
that
cheap
lands
would
depopulate
the
atlantic
coast
by
saying
that
if
a
law
were
framed
to
prevent
ready
access
to
western
lands
it
would
be
tantamount
to
saying
that
there
is
some
class
which
must
remain
and
by
law
be
obliged
to
serve
the
others
for
such
wages
as
they
pleased
to
give
the
passage
of
the
arable
public
domain
into
private
possession
has
raised
this
question
in
a
new
form
and
has
brought
forth
new
answers
this
is
peculiarly
the
era
when
competitive
individualism
in
the
midst
of
vast
unappropriated
opportunities
changed
into
the
monopoly
of
the
fundamental
industrial
processes
by
huge
aggregations
of
capital
as
the
free
lands
disappeared
all
the
tendencies
of
the
production
of
the
twentieth
century
all
the
trend
to
the
massing
of
capital
in
large
combinations
all
of
the
energies
of
the
age
of
steam
found
in
america
exceptional
freedom
of
action
and
were
offered
regions
of
activity
equal
to
the
states
of
all
western
europe
here
they
reached
their
highest
development
the
decade
following
is
marked
by
the
work
of
harriman
and
his
rivals
in
building
up
the
various
railroads
into
a
few
great
groups
a
process
that
had
gone
so
far
that
before
his
death
harriman
was
ambitious
to
concentrate
them
all
under
his
single
control
high
finance
under
the
leadership
of
morgan
steadily
achieved
the
consolidation
of
the
greater
industries
into
trusts
or
combinations
and
effected
a
community
of
interests
between
them
and
a
few
dominant
banking
organizations
with
allied
insurance
companies
and
trust
companies
in
new
york
city
have
been
centered
as
never
before
the
banking
reserves
of
the
nation
and
here
by
the
financial
management
of
capital
and
speculative
promotion
there
has
grown
up
a
unified
control
over
the
nation
industrial
life
colossal
private
fortunes
have
arisen
no
longer
is
the
per
capita
wealth
of
the
nation
a
real
index
to
the
prosperity
of
the
average
man
labor
on
the
other
hand
has
shown
an
increasing
is
combining
and
increasing
its
demands
in
a
word
the
old
pioneer
individualism
is
disappearing
while
the
forces
of
social
combination
are
manifesting
themselves
as
never
before
the
man
has
become
in
popular
speech
the
coal
baron
the
steel
king
the
oil
king
the
cattle
king
the
railroad
magnate
the
master
of
high
finance
the
monarch
of
trusts
the
world
has
never
before
seen
such
huge
fortunes
exercising
combined
control
over
the
economic
life
of
a
people
and
such
luxury
as
has
come
out
of
the
individualistic
pioneer
democracy
of
america
in
the
course
of
competitive
evolution
at
the
same
time
the
masters
of
industry
who
control
interests
which
represent
billions
of
dollars
do
not
admit
that
they
have
broken
with
pioneer
ideals
they
regard
themselves
as
pioneers
under
changed
conditions
carrying
on
the
old
work
of
developing
the
natural
resources
of
the
nation
compelled
by
the
constructive
fever
in
their
veins
even
in
and
old
age
and
after
the
accumulation
of
wealth
beyond
their
power
to
enjoy
to
seek
new
avenues
of
action
and
of
power
to
chop
new
clearings
to
find
new
trails
to
expand
the
horizon
of
the
nation
activity
and
to
extend
the
scope
of
their
dominion
this
country
said
the
late
harriman
in
an
interview
a
few
years
ago
has
been
developed
by
a
wonderful
people
flush
with
enthusiasm
imagination
and
speculative
bent
they
have
been
magnificent
pioneers
they
saw
into
the
future
and
adapted
their
work
to
the
possibilities
stifle
that
enthusiasm
deaden
that
imagination
and
prohibit
that
speculation
by
restrictive
and
cramping
conservative
law
and
you
tend
to
produce
a
moribund
and
conservative
people
and
country
this
is
an
appeal
to
the
historic
ideals
of
americans
who
viewed
the
republic
as
the
guardian
of
individual
freedom
to
compete
for
the
control
of
the
natural
resources
of
the
nation
on
the
other
hand
we
have
the
voice
of
the
insurgent
west
recently
given
utterance
in
the
new
nationalism
of
roosevelt
demanding
increase
of
federal
authority
to
curb
the
special
interests
the
powerful
industrial
organizations
and
the
monopolies
for
the
sake
of
the
conservation
of
our
natural
resources
and
the
preservation
of
american
democracy
the
past
decade
has
witnessed
an
extraordinary
federal
activity
in
limiting
individual
and
corporate
freedom
for
the
benefit
of
society
to
that
decade
belong
the
conservation
congresses
and
the
effective
organization
of
the
forest
service
and
the
reclamation
service
taken
together
these
developments
alone
would
mark
a
new
era
for
over
three
hundred
million
acres
are
as
a
result
of
this
policy
reserved
from
entry
and
sale
an
area
more
than
equal
to
that
of
all
the
states
which
established
the
constitution
if
we
exclude
their
western
claims
and
these
reserved
lands
are
held
for
a
more
beneficial
use
of
their
forests
minerals
arid
tracts
and
water
rights
by
the
nation
as
a
whole
another
example
is
the
extension
of
the
activity
of
the
department
of
agriculture
which
seeks
the
remotest
regions
of
the
earth
for
crops
suitable
to
the
areas
reclaimed
by
the
government
maps
and
analyzes
the
soils
fosters
the
improvement
of
seeds
and
animals
tells
the
farmer
when
and
how
and
what
to
plant
and
makes
war
upon
diseases
of
plants
and
animals
and
insect
pests
the
recent
legislation
for
pure
food
and
meat
inspection
and
the
whole
mass
of
regulative
law
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
further
illustrates
the
same
tendency
two
ideals
were
fundamental
in
traditional
american
thought
ideals
that
developed
in
the
pioneer
era
one
was
that
of
individual
freedom
to
compete
unrestrictedly
for
the
resources
of
a
continent
the
squatter
ideal
to
the
pioneer
government
was
an
evil
the
other
was
the
ideal
of
a
democracy
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
the
operation
of
these
ideals
took
place
contemporaneously
with
the
passing
into
private
possession
of
the
free
public
domain
and
the
natural
resources
of
the
united
states
but
american
democracy
was
based
on
an
abundance
of
free
lands
these
were
the
very
conditions
that
shaped
its
growth
and
its
fundamental
traits
thus
time
has
revealed
that
these
two
ideals
of
pioneer
democracy
had
elements
of
mutual
hostility
and
contained
the
seeds
of
its
dissolution
the
present
finds
itself
engaged
in
the
task
of
readjusting
its
old
ideals
to
new
conditions
and
is
turning
increasingly
to
government
to
preserve
its
traditional
democracy
it
is
not
surprising
that
socialism
shows
noteworthy
gains
as
elections
continue
that
parties
are
forming
on
new
lines
that
the
demand
for
primary
elections
for
popular
choice
of
senators
initiative
referendum
and
recall
is
spreading
and
that
the
regions
once
the
center
of
pioneer
democracy
exhibit
these
tendencies
in
the
most
marked
degree
they
are
efforts
to
find
substitutes
for
that
former
safeguard
of
democracy
the
disappearing
free
lands
they
are
the
sequence
to
the
extinction
of
the
frontier
it
is
necessary
next
to
notice
that
in
the
midst
of
all
this
national
energy
and
contemporaneous
with
the
tendency
to
turn
to
the
national
government
for
protection
to
democracy
there
is
clear
evidence
of
the
persistence
and
the
development
of
sectionalism
whether
we
observe
the
grouping
of
votes
in
congress
and
in
general
elections
or
the
organization
and
utterances
of
business
leaders
or
the
association
of
scholars
churches
or
other
representatives
of
the
things
of
the
spirit
we
find
that
american
life
is
not
only
increasing
in
its
national
intensity
but
that
it
is
integrating
by
sections
in
part
this
is
due
to
the
factor
of
great
spaces
which
make
sectional
rather
than
national
organization
the
line
of
least
resistance
but
in
part
it
is
also
the
expression
of
the
separate
economic
political
and
social
interests
and
the
separate
spiritual
life
of
the
various
geographic
provinces
or
sections
the
votes
on
the
tariff
and
in
general
the
location
of
the
strongholds
of
the
progressive
republican
movement
illustrate
this
fact
the
difficulty
of
a
national
adjustment
of
railway
rates
to
the
diverse
interests
of
different
sections
is
another
example
without
attempting
to
enter
upon
a
more
extensive
discussion
of
sectionalism
i
desire
simply
to
point
out
that
there
are
evidences
that
now
as
formerly
the
separate
geographical
interests
have
their
leaders
and
spokesmen
that
much
congressional
legislation
is
determined
by
the
contests
triumphs
or
compromises
between
the
rival
sections
and
that
the
real
federal
relations
of
the
united
states
are
shaped
by
the
interplay
of
sectional
with
national
forces
rather
than
by
the
relation
of
state
and
nation
as
time
goes
on
and
the
nation
adjusts
itself
more
durably
to
the
conditions
of
the
differing
geographic
sections
which
make
it
up
they
are
coming
to
a
new
and
a
revived
our
national
character
is
a
composite
of
these
sections
obviously
in
attempting
to
indicate
even
a
portion
of
the
significant
features
of
our
recent
history
we
have
been
obliged
to
take
note
of
a
complex
of
forces
the
times
are
so
close
at
hand
that
the
relations
between
events
and
tendencies
force
themselves
upon
our
attention
we
have
had
to
deal
with
the
connections
of
geography
industrial
growth
politics
and
government
with
these
we
must
take
into
consideration
the
changing
social
composition
the
inherited
beliefs
and
habitual
attitude
of
the
masses
of
the
people
the
psychology
of
the
nation
and
of
the
separate
sections
as
well
as
of
the
leaders
we
must
see
how
these
leaders
are
shaped
partly
by
their
time
and
section
and
how
they
are
in
part
original
creative
by
virtue
of
their
own
genius
and
initiative
we
can
not
neglect
the
moral
tendencies
and
the
ideals
all
are
related
parts
of
the
same
subject
and
can
no
more
be
properly
understood
in
isolation
than
the
movement
as
a
whole
can
be
understood
by
neglecting
some
of
these
important
factors
or
by
the
use
of
a
single
method
of
investigation
whatever
be
the
truth
regarding
european
history
american
history
is
chiefly
concerned
with
social
forces
shaping
and
reshaping
under
the
conditions
of
a
nation
changing
as
it
adjusts
to
its
environment
and
this
environment
progressively
reveals
new
aspects
of
itself
exerts
new
influences
and
calls
out
new
social
organs
and
functions
i
have
undertaken
this
rapid
survey
of
recent
history
for
two
purposes
first
because
it
has
seemed
fitting
to
emphasize
the
significance
of
american
development
since
the
passing
of
the
frontier
and
second
because
in
the
observation
of
present
conditions
we
may
find
assistance
in
our
study
of
the
past
it
is
a
familiar
doctrine
that
each
age
studies
its
history
anew
and
with
interests
determined
by
the
spirit
of
the
time
each
age
finds
it
necessary
to
reconsider
at
least
some
portion
of
the
past
from
points
of
view
furnished
by
new
conditions
which
reveal
the
influence
and
significance
of
forces
not
adequately
known
by
the
historians
of
the
previous
generation
unquestionably
each
investigator
and
writer
is
influenced
by
the
times
in
which
he
lives
and
while
this
fact
exposes
the
historian
to
a
bias
at
the
same
time
it
affords
him
new
instruments
and
new
insight
for
dealing
with
his
subject
if
recent
history
then
gives
new
meaning
to
past
events
if
it
has
to
deal
with
the
rise
into
a
commanding
position
of
forces
the
origin
and
growth
of
which
may
have
been
inadequately
described
or
even
overlooked
by
historians
of
the
previous
generation
it
is
important
to
study
the
present
and
the
recent
past
not
only
for
themselves
but
also
as
the
source
of
new
hypotheses
new
lines
of
inquiry
new
criteria
of
the
perspective
of
the
remoter
past
and
moreover
a
just
public
opinion
and
a
statesmanlike
treatment
of
present
problems
demand
that
they
be
seen
in
their
historical
relations
in
order
that
history
may
hold
the
lamp
for
conservative
reform
seen
from
the
of
present
developments
what
new
light
falls
upon
past
events
when
we
consider
what
the
mississippi
valley
has
come
to
be
in
american
life
and
when
we
consider
what
it
is
yet
to
be
the
young
washington
crossing
the
snows
of
the
wilderness
to
summon
the
french
to
evacuate
the
portals
of
the
great
valley
becomes
the
herald
of
an
empire
when
we
recall
the
huge
industrial
power
that
has
centered
at
pittsburgh
braddock
advance
to
the
forks
of
the
ohio
takes
on
new
meaning
even
in
defeat
he
opened
a
road
to
what
is
now
the
center
of
the
world
industrial
energy
the
modifications
which
england
proposed
in
to
john
jay
in
the
northwestern
boundary
of
the
united
states
from
the
lake
of
the
woods
to
the
mississippi
seemed
to
him
doubtless
significant
chiefly
as
a
matter
of
principle
and
as
a
question
of
the
retention
or
loss
of
beaver
grounds
the
historians
hardly
notice
the
proposals
but
they
involved
in
fact
the
ownership
of
the
richest
and
most
extensive
deposits
of
iron
ore
in
america
the
source
of
a
fundamental
industry
of
the
united
states
the
occasion
for
the
rise
of
some
of
the
most
influential
forces
of
our
time
what
continuity
and
meaning
are
furnished
by
the
outcome
in
present
times
of
the
movements
of
minor
political
parties
and
reform
agitations
to
the
historian
they
have
often
seemed
to
be
mere
curious
side
eddies
vexatious
distractions
to
the
course
of
his
literary
craft
as
it
navigated
the
stream
of
historical
tendency
and
yet
by
the
revelation
of
the
present
what
seemed
to
be
side
eddies
have
not
seldom
proven
to
be
the
concealed
entrances
to
the
main
current
and
the
course
which
seemed
the
central
one
has
led
to
blind
channels
and
stagnant
waters
important
in
their
day
but
cut
off
like
oxbow
lakes
from
the
mighty
river
of
historical
progress
by
the
mere
permanent
and
compelling
forces
of
the
neglected
currents
we
may
trace
the
contest
between
the
capitalist
and
the
democratic
pioneer
from
the
earliest
colonial
days
it
is
influential
in
colonial
parties
it
is
seen
in
the
vehement
protests
of
kentucky
frontiersmen
in
petition
after
petition
to
the
congress
of
the
confederation
against
the
nabobs
and
men
of
wealth
who
took
out
titles
to
the
pioneers
farms
while
they
themselves
were
too
busy
defending
those
farms
from
the
indians
to
perfect
their
claims
it
is
seen
in
the
attitude
of
the
ohio
valley
in
its
backwoods
days
before
the
rise
of
the
whig
party
as
when
in
henry
clay
denounced
the
bank
of
the
united
states
as
a
corporation
which
throve
on
special
privileges
a
special
association
of
favored
individuals
taken
from
the
mass
of
society
and
invested
with
exemptions
and
surrounded
by
immunities
and
privileges
benton
voiced
the
same
contest
twenty
years
later
when
he
denounced
the
bank
as
a
company
of
private
individuals
many
of
them
foreigners
and
the
mass
of
them
residing
in
a
remote
and
narrow
corner
of
the
union
unconnected
by
any
sympathy
with
the
fertile
regions
of
the
great
valley
in
which
the
natural
power
of
this
union
the
power
of
numbers
will
be
found
to
reside
long
before
the
renewed
term
of
the
second
charter
would
expire
and
where
he
asked
would
all
this
power
and
money
center
in
the
great
cities
of
the
northeast
which
have
been
for
forty
years
and
that
by
force
of
federal
legislation
the
lion
den
of
southern
and
western
money
that
den
into
which
all
the
tracks
point
inward
from
which
the
returning
track
of
a
solitary
dollar
has
never
yet
been
seen
declaring
in
words
that
have
a
very
modern
sound
that
the
bank
tended
to
multiply
nabobs
and
paupers
and
that
a
great
moneyed
power
is
favorable
to
great
capitalists
for
it
is
the
principle
of
capital
to
favor
capital
he
appealed
to
the
fact
of
the
country
extent
and
its
sectional
divergences
against
the
nationalizing
of
capital
what
a
condition
for
a
confederacy
of
states
what
grounds
for
alarm
and
terrible
apprehension
when
in
a
confederacy
of
such
vast
extent
so
many
rival
commercial
cities
so
much
sectional
jealousy
such
violent
political
parties
such
fierce
contests
for
power
there
should
be
but
one
moneyed
tribunal
before
which
all
the
rival
and
contending
elements
must
appear
even
more
vehement
were
the
words
of
jackson
in
it
is
now
plain
he
wrote
that
the
war
is
to
be
carried
on
by
the
monied
aristocracy
of
the
few
against
the
democracy
of
numbers
the
prosperous
to
make
the
honest
laborers
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
through
the
credit
and
paper
system
van
buren
administration
is
usually
passed
hastily
over
with
hardly
more
than
mention
of
his
independent
treasury
plan
and
with
particular
consideration
of
the
slavery
discussion
but
some
of
the
most
important
movements
in
american
social
and
political
history
began
in
these
years
of
jackson
and
van
buren
read
the
demands
of
the
obscure
labor
papers
and
the
reports
of
labor
meetings
anew
and
you
will
find
in
the
utterances
of
labor
visionaries
and
the
locofoco
champions
of
equal
rights
for
all
and
special
privileges
for
none
like
evans
and
jacques
byrdsall
and
leggett
the
finger
points
to
the
currents
that
now
make
the
main
channel
of
our
history
you
will
find
in
them
some
of
the
important
planks
of
the
platforms
of
the
triumphant
parties
of
our
own
day
as
professor
commons
has
shown
by
his
papers
and
the
documents
which
he
has
published
on
labor
history
an
idealistic
but
widespread
and
influential
humanitarian
movement
strikingly
similar
to
that
of
the
present
arose
in
the
years
between
and
dealing
with
social
forces
in
american
life
animated
by
a
desire
to
apply
the
public
lands
to
social
amelioration
eager
to
find
new
forms
of
democratic
development
but
the
flood
of
the
slavery
struggle
swept
all
of
these
movements
into
its
mighty
inundation
for
the
time
after
the
war
other
influences
delayed
the
revival
of
the
movement
the
railroads
opened
the
wide
prairies
after
and
made
it
easy
to
reach
them
and
decade
after
decade
new
sections
were
reduced
to
the
purposes
of
civilization
and
to
the
advantages
of
the
common
man
as
well
as
the
promotion
of
great
individual
fortunes
the
nation
centered
its
interests
in
the
development
of
the
west
it
is
only
in
our
own
day
that
this
humanitarian
democratic
wave
has
reached
the
level
of
those
earlier
years
but
in
the
meantime
there
are
clear
evidences
of
the
persistence
of
the
forces
even
though
under
strange
guise
read
the
platforms
of
the
the
granger
and
the
populist
parties
and
you
will
find
in
those
platforms
discredited
and
reprobated
by
the
major
parties
of
the
time
the
basic
proposals
of
the
democratic
party
after
its
revolution
under
the
leadership
of
bryan
and
of
the
republican
party
after
its
revolution
by
roosevelt
the
insurgent
movement
is
so
clearly
related
to
the
areas
and
elements
that
gave
strength
to
this
progressive
assertion
of
old
democratic
ideals
with
new
weapons
that
it
must
be
regarded
as
the
organized
refusal
of
these
persistent
tendencies
to
be
checked
by
the
advocates
of
more
moderate
measures
i
have
dealt
with
these
fragments
of
party
history
not
of
course
with
the
purpose
of
expressing
any
present
judgment
upon
them
but
to
emphasize
and
give
concreteness
to
the
fact
that
there
is
disclosed
by
present
events
a
new
significance
to
these
contests
of
radical
democracy
and
conservative
interests
that
they
are
rather
a
continuing
expression
of
forces
than
fragmentary
and
sporadic
curios
for
the
historical
museum
if
we
should
survey
the
history
of
our
lands
from
a
similar
point
of
view
considering
the
relations
of
legislation
and
administration
of
the
public
domain
to
the
structure
of
american
democracy
it
would
yield
a
return
far
beyond
that
offered
by
the
formal
treatment
of
the
subject
in
most
of
our
histories
we
should
find
in
the
squatter
doctrines
and
practices
the
seizure
of
the
best
soils
the
taking
of
public
timber
on
the
theory
of
a
right
to
it
by
the
labor
expended
on
it
fruitful
material
for
understanding
the
atmosphere
and
ideals
under
which
the
great
corporations
developed
the
west
men
like
senator
benton
and
delegate
sibley
in
successive
generations
defended
the
trespasses
of
the
pioneer
and
the
lumberman
upon
the
public
forest
lands
and
denounced
the
paternal
government
that
harassed
these
men
who
were
engaged
in
what
we
should
call
stealing
government
timber
it
is
evident
that
at
some
time
between
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
present
time
when
we
impose
jail
sentences
upon
congressmen
caught
in
such
violations
of
the
land
laws
a
change
came
over
the
american
conscience
and
the
civic
ideals
were
modified
that
our
great
industrial
enterprises
developed
in
the
midst
of
these
changing
ideals
is
important
to
recall
when
we
write
the
history
of
their
activity
we
should
find
also
that
we
can
not
understand
the
land
question
without
seeing
its
relations
to
the
struggle
of
sections
and
classes
bidding
against
each
other
and
finding
in
the
public
domain
a
most
important
topic
of
political
bargaining
we
should
find
too
that
the
settlement
of
unlike
geographic
areas
in
the
course
of
the
nation
progress
resulted
in
changes
in
the
effect
of
the
land
laws
that
a
system
intended
for
the
humid
prairies
was
to
the
grazing
lands
and
coal
fields
and
to
the
forests
in
the
days
of
exploitation
by
corporations
commanding
great
capital
thus
changing
geographic
factors
as
well
as
the
changing
character
of
the
forces
which
occupied
the
public
domain
must
be
considered
if
we
would
understand
the
bearing
of
legislation
and
policy
in
this
field
it
is
fortunate
that
suggestive
studies
of
democracy
and
the
land
policy
have
already
begun
to
appear
the
whole
subject
of
american
agriculture
viewed
in
relation
to
the
economic
political
and
social
life
of
the
nation
has
important
contributions
to
make
if
for
example
we
study
the
maps
showing
the
transition
of
the
wheat
belt
from
the
east
to
the
west
as
the
virgin
soils
were
conquered
and
made
new
bases
for
destructive
competition
with
the
older
wheat
states
we
shall
see
how
deeply
they
affected
not
only
land
values
railroad
building
the
movement
of
population
and
the
supply
of
cheap
food
but
also
how
the
regions
once
devoted
to
single
cropping
of
wheat
were
forced
to
turn
to
varied
and
intensive
agriculture
and
to
diversified
industry
and
we
shall
see
also
how
these
transformations
affected
party
politics
and
even
the
ideals
of
the
americans
of
the
regions
thus
changed
we
shall
find
in
the
of
wheat
in
the
provinces
thus
rapidly
colonized
and
in
the
of
silver
in
the
mountain
provinces
which
were
contemporaneously
exploited
important
explanations
of
the
peculiar
form
which
american
politics
took
in
the
period
when
bryan
mastered
the
democratic
party
just
as
we
shall
find
in
the
opening
of
the
new
gold
fields
in
the
years
immediately
following
and
in
the
passing
of
the
era
of
almost
free
virgin
wheat
soils
explanations
of
the
more
recent
period
when
high
prices
are
giving
new
energy
and
aggressiveness
to
the
demands
of
the
new
american
industrial
democracy
enough
has
been
said
it
may
be
assumed
to
make
clear
the
point
which
i
am
trying
to
elucidate
namely
that
a
comprehension
of
the
united
states
of
an
understanding
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
forces
which
have
made
it
what
it
is
demands
that
we
should
rework
our
history
from
the
new
points
of
view
afforded
by
the
present
if
this
is
done
it
will
be
seen
for
example
that
the
progress
of
the
struggle
between
north
and
south
over
slavery
and
the
freed
negro
which
held
the
principal
place
in
american
interest
in
the
two
decades
after
was
after
all
only
one
of
the
interests
in
the
time
the
pages
of
the
congressional
debates
the
contemporary
newspapers
the
public
documents
of
those
twenty
years
remain
a
rich
mine
for
those
who
will
seek
therein
the
sources
of
movements
dominant
in
the
present
day
the
final
consideration
to
which
i
ask
your
attention
in
this
discussion
of
social
forces
in
american
life
is
with
reference
to
the
mode
of
investigating
them
and
the
bearing
of
these
investigations
upon
the
relations
and
the
goal
of
history
it
has
become
a
precedent
fairly
well
established
by
the
distinguished
scholars
who
have
held
the
office
which
i
am
about
to
lay
down
to
state
a
position
with
reference
to
the
relations
of
history
and
its
and
even
to
raise
the
question
of
the
attitude
of
the
historian
toward
the
laws
of
thermodynamics
and
to
seek
to
find
the
key
of
historical
development
or
of
historical
degradation
it
is
not
given
to
all
to
bend
the
bow
of
ulysses
i
shall
attempt
a
lesser
task
we
may
take
some
lessons
from
the
scientist
he
has
enriched
knowledge
especially
in
recent
years
by
attacking
the
lands
left
unexplored
by
the
too
sharp
delimitation
of
spheres
of
activity
these
new
conquests
have
been
especially
achieved
by
the
combination
of
old
sciences
physical
chemistry
and
a
variety
of
other
scientic
unions
have
led
to
audacious
hypotheses
veritable
flashes
of
vision
which
open
new
regions
of
activity
for
a
generation
of
investigators
moreover
they
have
promoted
such
investigations
by
furnishing
new
instruments
of
research
now
in
some
respects
there
is
an
analogy
between
geology
and
history
the
new
geologist
aims
to
describe
the
inorganic
earth
dynamically
in
terms
of
natural
law
using
chemistry
physics
mathematics
and
even
botany
and
zoölogy
so
far
as
they
relate
to
paleontology
but
he
does
not
insist
that
the
relative
importance
of
physical
or
chemical
factors
shall
be
determined
before
he
applies
the
methods
and
data
of
these
sciences
to
his
problem
indeed
he
has
learned
that
a
geological
area
is
too
complex
a
thing
to
be
reduced
to
a
single
explanation
he
has
abandoned
the
single
hypothesis
for
the
multiple
hypothesis
he
creates
a
whole
family
of
possible
explanations
of
a
given
problem
and
thus
avoids
the
warping
influence
of
partiality
for
a
simple
theory
have
we
not
here
an
illustration
of
what
is
possible
and
necessary
for
the
historian
is
it
not
well
before
attempting
to
decide
whether
history
requires
an
economic
interpretation
or
a
psychological
or
any
other
ultimate
interpretation
to
recognize
that
the
factors
in
human
society
are
varied
and
complex
that
the
political
historian
handling
his
subject
in
isolation
is
certain
to
miss
fundamental
facts
and
relations
in
his
treatment
of
a
given
age
or
nation
that
the
economic
historian
is
exposed
to
the
same
danger
and
so
of
all
of
the
other
special
historians
those
who
insist
that
history
is
simply
the
effort
to
tell
the
thing
exactly
as
it
was
to
state
the
facts
are
confronted
with
the
difficulty
that
the
fact
which
they
would
represent
is
not
planted
on
the
solid
ground
of
fixed
conditions
it
is
in
the
midst
and
is
itself
a
part
of
the
changing
currents
the
complex
and
interacting
influences
of
the
time
deriving
its
significance
as
a
fact
from
its
relations
to
the
movements
of
the
age
movements
so
gradual
that
often
only
the
passing
years
can
reveal
the
truth
about
the
fact
and
its
right
to
a
place
on
the
historian
page
the
economic
historian
is
in
danger
of
making
his
analysis
and
his
statement
of
a
law
on
the
basis
of
present
conditions
and
then
passing
to
history
for
justificatory
appendixes
to
his
conclusions
an
american
economist
of
high
rank
has
recently
expressed
his
conception
of
the
full
relation
of
economic
theory
statistics
and
history
in
these
words
a
principle
is
formulated
by
reasoning
concerning
facts
of
common
experience
it
is
then
tested
by
statistics
and
promoted
to
the
rank
of
a
known
and
acknowledged
truth
illustrations
of
its
action
are
then
found
in
narrative
history
and
on
the
other
hand
the
economic
law
becomes
the
interpreter
of
records
that
would
otherwise
be
confusing
and
comparatively
valueless
the
law
itself
derives
its
final
confirmation
from
the
illustrations
of
its
working
which
the
records
afford
but
what
is
at
least
of
equal
importance
is
the
parallel
fact
that
the
law
affords
the
decisive
test
of
the
correctness
of
those
assertions
concerning
the
causes
and
the
effects
of
past
events
which
it
is
second
nature
to
make
and
which
historians
almost
invariably
do
make
in
connection
with
their
narrations
there
is
much
in
this
statement
by
which
the
historian
may
profit
but
he
may
doubt
also
whether
the
past
should
serve
merely
as
the
illustration
by
which
to
confirm
the
law
deduced
from
common
experience
by
reasoning
tested
by
statistics
in
fact
the
pathway
of
history
is
strewn
with
the
wrecks
of
the
known
and
acknowledged
truths
of
economic
law
due
not
only
to
defective
analysis
and
imperfect
statistics
but
also
to
the
lack
of
critical
historical
methods
of
insufficient
on
the
part
of
the
economist
to
failure
to
give
due
attention
to
the
relativity
and
transiency
of
the
conditions
from
which
his
laws
were
deduced
but
the
point
on
which
i
would
lay
stress
is
this
the
economist
the
political
scientist
the
psychologist
the
sociologist
the
geographer
the
student
of
literature
of
art
of
religion
all
the
allied
laborers
in
the
study
of
society
have
contributions
to
make
to
the
equipment
of
the
historian
these
contributions
are
partly
of
material
partly
of
tools
partly
of
new
points
of
view
new
hypotheses
new
suggestions
of
relations
causes
and
emphasis
each
of
these
special
students
is
in
some
danger
of
bias
by
his
particular
point
of
view
by
his
exposure
to
see
simply
the
thing
in
which
he
is
primarily
interested
and
also
by
his
effort
to
deduce
the
universal
laws
of
his
separate
science
the
historian
on
the
other
hand
is
exposed
to
the
danger
of
dealing
with
the
complex
and
interacting
social
forces
of
a
period
or
of
a
country
from
some
single
point
of
view
to
which
his
special
training
or
interest
inclines
him
if
the
truth
is
to
be
made
known
the
historian
must
so
far
familiarize
himself
with
the
work
and
equip
himself
with
the
training
of
his
that
he
can
at
least
avail
himself
of
their
results
and
in
some
reasonable
degree
master
the
essential
tools
of
their
trade
and
the
followers
of
the
must
likewise
familiarize
themselves
and
their
students
with
the
work
and
the
methods
of
the
historians
and
coöperate
in
the
difficult
task
it
is
necessary
that
the
american
historian
shall
aim
at
this
equipment
not
so
much
that
he
may
possess
the
key
to
history
or
satisfy
himself
in
regard
to
its
ultimate
laws
at
present
a
different
duty
is
before
him
he
must
see
in
american
society
with
its
vast
spaces
its
sections
equal
to
european
nations
its
geographic
influences
its
brief
period
of
development
its
variety
of
nationalities
and
races
its
extraordinary
industrial
growth
under
the
conditions
of

its
institutions

ideals
social

and
even
its

country
could
he
have
better
pictured
the
contrasts
between
the
prussian
and
the
american
spirit
he
went
on
to
say
thus
was
founded
the
colony
of
free
which
has
not
old
england
alone
but
the
for
its
mother
country
and
in
the
colony
of
free
humanity
whose
mother
country
is
the
world
they
established
the
republic
of
equal
rights
where
the
title
of
manhood
is
the
title
to
citizenship
my
friends
if
i
had
a
thousand
tongues
and
a
voice
as
strong
as
the
thunder
of
heaven
they
would
not
be
sufficient
to
impress
upon
your
minds
forcibly
enough
the
greatness
of
this
idea
the
overshadowing
glory
of
this
result
this
was
the
dream
of
the
truest
friends
of
man
from
the
beginning
for
this
the
noblest
blood
of
martyrs
has
been
shed
for
this
has
mankind
waded
through
seas
of
blood
and
tears
there
it
is
now
there
it
stands
the
noble
fabric
in
all
the
splendor
of
reality
it
is
in
a
solemn
and
inspiring
time
therefore
that
we
meet
to
dedicate
this
building
and
the
occasion
is
fitting
to
the
time
we
may
now
see
as
never
before
the
deeper
significance
the
larger
meaning
of
these
pioneers
whose
plain
lives
and
homely
annals
are
glorified
as
a
part
of
the
story
of
the
building
of
a
better
system
of
social
justice
under
freedom
a
broader
and
as
we
fervently
hope
a
more
enduring
foundation
for
the
welfare
and
progress
under
individual
liberty
of
the
common
man
an
example
of
federation
of
peaceful
adjustments
by
compromise
and
concession
under
a
republic
where
sections
replace
nations
over
a
union
as
large
as
europe
where
party
discussions
take
the
place
of
warring
countries
where
the
furnishes
an
example
for
a
better
world
as
our
forefathers
the
pioneers
gathered
in
their
neighborhood
to
raise
the
log
cabin
and
sanctified
it
by
the
name
of
home
the
dwelling
place
of
pioneer
ideals
so
we
meet
to
celebrate
the
raising
of
this
home
this
shrine
of
minnesota
historic
life
it
symbolizes
the
conviction
that
the
past
and
the
future
of
this
people
are
tied
together
that
this
historical
society
is
the
keeper
of
the
records
of
a
noteworthy
movement
in
the
progress
of
mankind
that
these
records
are
not
unmeaning
and
antiquarian
but
even
in
their
details
are
worthy
of
preservation
for
their
revelation
of
the
beginnings
of
society
in
the
midst
of
a
nation
caught
by
the
vision
of
a
better
future
for
the
world
let
me
repeat
the
words
of
harriet
martineau
who
portrayed
the
american
of
the
thirties
i
regard
the
american
people
as
a
great
embryo
poet
now
moody
now
wild
but
bringing
out
results
of
absolute
good
sense
restless
and
wayward
in
action
but
with
deep
peace
at
his
heart
exulting
that
he
has
caught
the
true
aspect
of
things
past
and
the
depth
of
futurity
which
lies
before
him
wherein
to
create
something
so
magnificent
as
the
world
has
scarcely
begun
to
dream
of
there
is
the
strongest
hope
of
a
nation
that
is
capable
of
being
possessed
with
an
idea
and
recall
her
appeal
to
the
american
people
to
cherish
their
high
democratic
hope
their
faith
in
man
the
older
they
grow
the
more
they
must
reverence
the
dreams
of
their
youth
the
dreams
of
their
youth
here
they
shall
be
preserved
and
the
achievements
as
well
as
the
aspirations
of
the
men
who
made
the
state
the
men
who
built
on
their
foundations
the
men
with
large
vision
and
power
of
action
the
lesser
men
in
the
mass
the
leaders
who
served
the
state
and
nation
with
devotion
to
the
cause
here
shall
be
preserved
the
record
of
the
men
who
failed
to
see
the
larger
vision
and
worked
impatiently
with
narrow
or
selfish
or
class
ends
as
well
as
of
those
who
labored
with
patience
and
sympathy
and
mutual
concession
with
readiness
to
make
adjustments
and
to
subordinate
their
immediate
interests
to
the
larger
good
and
the
immediate
safety
of
the
nation
in
the
archives
of
such
an
old
institution
as
that
of
the
historical
society
of
massachusetts
whose
treasures
run
to
the
beginnings
of
the
puritan
colonization
the
students
can
not
fail
to
find
the
evidence
that
a
state
historical
society
is
a
book
of
judgment
wherein
is
made
up
the
record
of
a
people
and
its
leaders
so
as
time
unfolds
shall
be
the
collections
of
this
society
the
depository
of
the
material
that
shall
preserve
the
memory
of
this
people
each
section
of
this
widely
extended
and
varied
nation
has
its
own
peculiar
past
its
special
form
of
society
its
traits
and
its
leaders
it
were
a
pity
if
any
section
left
its
annals
solely
to
the
collectors
of
a
remote
region
and
it
were
a
pity
if
its
collections
were
not
transformed
into
printed
documents
and
monographic
studies
which
can
go
to
the
libraries
of
all
the
parts
of
the
union
and
thus
enable
the
student
to
see
the
nation
as
a
whole
in
its
past
as
well
as
in
its
present
this
society
finds
its
special
field
of
activity
in
a
great
state
of
the
middle
west
so
new
as
history
reckons
time
that
its
annals
are
still
predominantly
those
of
the
pioneers
but
so
rapidly
growing
that
already
the
era
of
the
pioneers
is
a
part
of
the
history
of
the
past
capable
of
being
handled
objectively
seen
in
a
perspective
that
is
not
possible
to
the
observer
of
the
present
conditions
because
of
these
facts
i
have
taken
as
the
special
theme
of
this
address
the
middle
western
pioneer
democracy
which
i
would
sketch
in
some
of
its
outstanding
aspects
and
chiefly
in
the
generation
before
the
civil
war
for
it
was
from
those
pioneers
that
the
later
colonization
to
the
newer
parts
of
the
mississippi
valley
derived
much
of
their
traits
and
from
whom
large
numbers
of
them
came
the
north
central
states
as
a
whole
is
a
region
comparable
to
all
of
central
europe
of
these
states
a
large
part
of
the
old
northwest
ohio
indiana
illinois
michigan
and
wisconsin
and
their
sisters
beyond
the
mississippi
missouri
iowa
and
minnesota
were
still
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
home
of
an
essentially
pioneer
society
within
the
lifetime
of
many
living
men
wisconsin
was
called
the
far
west
and
minnesota
was
a
land
of
the
indian
and
the
fur
traders
a
wilderness
of
forest
and
prairie
beyond
the
edge
of
cultivation
that
portion
of
this
great
region
which
was
still
in
the
pioneering
period
of
settlement
by
was
alone
about
as
extensive
as
the
old
thirteen
states
or
germany
and
combined
the
region
was
a
huge
geographic
mold
for
a
new
society
modeled
by
nature
on
the
scale
of
the
great
lakes
the
ohio
valley
the
upper
mississippi
and
the
missouri
simple
and
majestic
in
its
vast
outlines
it
was
graven
into
a
variety
that
in
its
detail
also
had
a
largeness
of
design
from
the
great
lakes
extended
the
massive
glacial
sheet
which
covered
that
mighty
basin
and
laid
down
treasures
of
soil
vast
forests
of
pine
shrouded
its
upper
zone
breaking
into
hardwood
and
the
oak
openings
as
they
neared
the
expanses
of
the
prairies
forests
again
along
the
ohio
valley
and
beyond
to
the
west
lay
the
levels
of
the
great
plains
within
the
earth
were
unexploited
treasures
of
coal
and
lead
copper
and
iron
in
such
form
and
quantity
as
were
to
revolutionize
the
industrial
processes
of
the
world
but
revelations
are
progressive
and
it
was
rather
the
marvelous
adaptation
of
the
soil
to
the
raising
of
corn
and
wheat
that
drew
the
pioneers
to
this
land
of
promise
and
made
a
new
era
of
colonization
in
the
unity
with
variety
of
this
pioneer
empire
and
in
its
broad
levels
we
have
a
promise
of
its
society
first
had
come
the
children
of
the
interior
of
the
south
and
with
ax
and
rifle
in
hand
had
cut
their
clearings
in
the
forest
raised
their
log
cabins
fought
the
indians
and
by
had
pushed
their
way
to
the
very
edge
of
the
prairies
along
the
ohio
and
missouri
valleys
leaving
unoccupied
most
of
the
basin
of
the
great
lakes
these
slashers
of
the
forest
these
pioneers
raising
the
corn
and
live
stock
for
their
own
need
living
scattered
and
apart
had
at
first
small
interest
in
town
life
or
a
share
in
markets
they
were
passionately
devoted
to
the
ideal
of
equality
but
it
was
an
ideal
which
assumed
that
under
free
conditions
in
the
midst
of
unlimited
resources
the
homogeneous
society
of
the
pioneers
result
in
equality
what
they
objected
to
was
arbitrary
obstacles
artificial
limitations
upon
the
freedom
of
each
member
of
this
frontier
folk
to
work
out
his
own
career
without
fear
or
favor
what
they
instinctively
opposed
was
the
crystallization
of
differences
the
monopolization
of
opportunity
and
the
fixing
of
that
monopoly
by
government
or
by
social
customs
the
road
must
be
open
the
game
must
be
played
according
to
the
rules
there
must
be
no
artificial
stifling
of
equality
of
opportunity
no
closed
doors
to
the
able
no
stopping
the
free
game
before
it
was
played
to
the
end
more
than
that
there
was
an
unformulated
perhaps
but
very
real
feeling
that
mere
success
in
the
game
by
which
the
abler
men
were
able
to
achieve
preëminence
gave
to
the
successful
ones
no
right
to
look
down
upon
their
neighbors
no
vested
title
to
assert
superiority
as
a
matter
of
pride
and
to
the
diminution
of
the
equal
right
and
dignity
of
the
less
successful
if
this
democracy
of
southern
pioneers
this
jacksonian
democracy
was
as
its
socialist
critics
have
called
it
in
reality
a
democracy
of
expectant
capitalists
it
was
not
one
which
expected
or
acknowledged
on
the
part
of
the
successful
ones
the
right
to
harden
their
triumphs
into
the
rule
of
a
privileged
class
in
short
if
it
is
indeed
true
that
the
backwoods
democracy
was
based
upon
equality
of
opportunity
it
is
also
true
that
it
resented
the
conception
that
opportunity
under
competition
should
result
in
the
hopeless
inequality
or
rule
of
class
ever
a
new
clearing
must
be
possible
and
because
the
wilderness
seemed
so
unending
the
menace
to
the
enjoyment
of
this
ideal
seemed
rather
to
be
feared
from
government
within
or
without
than
from
the
operations
of
internal
evolution
from
the
first
it
became
evident
that
these
men
had
means
of
supplementing
their
individual
activity
by
informal
combinations
one
of
the
things
that
impressed
all
early
travelers
in
the
united
states
was
the
capacity
for
voluntary
association
this
was
natural
enough
in
all
america
we
can
study
the
process
by
which
in
a
new
land
social
customs
form
and
crystallize
into
law
we
can
even
see
how
the
personal
leader
becomes
the
governmental
official
this
power
of
the
newly
arrived
pioneers
to
join
together
for
a
common
end
without
the
intervention
of
governmental
institutions
was
one
of
their
marked
characteristics
the
log
rolling
the
the
husking
bee
the
apple
paring
and
the
squatters
associations
whereby
they
protected
themselves
against
the
speculators
in
securing
title
to
their
clearings
on
the
public
domain
the
camp
meeting
the
mining
camp
the
vigilantes
the
associations
the
gentlemen
agreements
are
a
few
of
the
indications
of
this
attitude
it
is
well
to
emphasize
this
american
trait
because
in
a
modified
way
it
has
come
to
be
one
of
the
most
characteristic
and
important
features
of
the
united
states
of
america
does
through
informal
association
and
understandings
on
the
part
of
the
people
many
of
the
things
which
in
the
old
world
are
and
can
be
done
only
by
governmental
intervention
and
compulsion
these
associations
were
in
america
not
due
to
immemorial
custom
of
tribe
or
village
community
they
were
extemporized
by
voluntary
action
the
actions
of
these
associations
had
an
authority
akin
to
that
of
law
they
were
usually
not
so
much
evidences
of
a
disrespect
for
law
and
order
as
the
only
means
by
which
real
law
and
order
were
possible
in
a
region
where
settlement
and
society
had
gone
in
advance
of
the
institutions
and
instrumentalities
of
organized
society
because
of
these
elements
of
individualistic
competition
and
the
power
of
spontaneous
association
pioneers
were
responsive
to
leadership
the
backwoodsmen
knew
that
under
the
free
opportunities
of
his
life
the
abler
man
would
reveal
himself
and
show
them
the
way
by
free
choice
and
not
by
compulsion
by
spontaneous
impulse
and
not
by
the
domination
of
a
caste
they
rallied
around
a
cause
they
supported
an
issue
they
yielded
to
the
principle
of
government
by
agreement
and
they
hated
the
doctrine
of
autocracy
even
before
it
gained
a
name
they
looked
forward
to
the
extension
of
their
american
principles
to
the
old
world
and
their
keenest
apprehensions
came
from
the
possibility
of
the
extension
of
the
old
world
system
of
arbitrary
rule
its
class
wars
and
rivalries
and
interventions
to
the
destruction
of
the
free
states
and
democratic
institutions
which
they
were
building
in
the
forests
of
america
if
we
add
to
these
aspects
of
early
backwoods
democracy
its
spiritual
qualities
we
shall
more
easily
understand
them
these
men
were
emotional
as
they
wrested
their
clearing
from
the
woods
and
from
the
savages
who
surrounded
them
as
they
expanded
that
clearing
and
saw
the
beginnings
of
commonwealths
where
only
little
communities
had
been
and
as
they
saw
these
commonwealths
touch
hands
with
each
other
along
the
great
course
of
the
mississippi
river
they
became
enthusiastically
optimistic
and
confident
of
the
continued
expansion
of
this
democracy
they
had
faith
in
themselves
and
their
destiny
and
that
optimistic
faith
was
responsible
both
for
their
confidence
in
their
own
ability
to
rule
and
for
the
passion
for
expansion
they
looked
to
the
future
others
appeal
to
history
an
american
appeals
to
prophecy
and
with
malthus
in
one
hand
and
a
map
of
the
back
country
in
the
other
he
boldly
defies
us
to
a
comparison
with
america
as
she
is
to
be
said
a
london
periodical
in
just
because
perhaps
of
the
usual
isolation
of
their
lives
when
they
came
together
in
associations
whether
of
the
camp
meeting
or
of
the
political
gathering
they
felt
the
influence
of
a
common
emotion
and
enthusiasm
whether
presbyterian
baptist
or
methodist
these
people
saturated
their
religion
and
their
politics
with
feeling
both
the
stump
and
the
pulpit
were
centers
of
energy
electric
cells
capable
of
starting
widespreading
fires
they
both
their
religion
and
their
democracy
and
were
ready
to
fight
for
it
this
democracy
was
one
that
involved
a
real
feeling
of
social
comradeship
among
its
widespread
members
justice
catron
who
came
from
arkansas
to
the
supreme
court
in
the
presidency
of
jackson
said
the
people
of
new
orleans
and
louis
are
next
neighbors
if
we
desire
to
know
a
man
in
any
quarter
of
the
union
we
inquire
of
our
next
neighbor
who
but
the
other
day
lived
by
him
exaggerated
as
this
is
it
nevertheless
had
a
surprising
measure
of
truth
for
the
middle
west
as
well
for
the
mississippi
river
was
the
great
highway
down
which
groups
of
pioneers
like
abraham
lincoln
on
their
rafts
and
flat
boats
brought
the
little
neighborhood
surplus
after
the
steamboat
came
to
the
western
waters
the
voyages
up
and
down
by
merchants
and
by
farmers
shifting
their
homes
brought
people
into
contact
with
each
other
over
wide
areas
this
enlarged
neighborhood
democracy
was
determined
not
by
a
reluctant
admission
that
under
the
law
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
it
was
based
upon
good
fellowship
sympathy
and
understanding
they
were
of
a
stock
moreover
which
sought
new
trails
and
were
ready
to
follow
where
the
trail
led
innovators
in
society
as
well
as
finders
of
new
lands
by
the
southern
inundation
ebbed
and
a
different
tide
flowed
in
from
the
northeast
by
way
of
the
erie
canal
and
steam
navigation
on
the
great
lakes
to
occupy
the
zone
unreached
by
southern
settlement
this
new
tide
spread
along
the
margins
of
the
great
lakes
found
the
oak
openings
and
small
prairie
islands
of
southern
michigan
and
wisconsin
followed
the
fertile
forested
ribbons
along
the
river
courses
far
into
the
prairie
lands
and
by
the
end
of
the
forties
began
to
venture
into
the
margin
of
the
open
prairie
in
the
middle
west
contained
a
little
over
a
million
and
a
half
people
in
over
three
and
a
third
millions
in
nearly
five
and
a
half
millions
although
in
the
north
atlantic
states
numbered
between
three
and
four
times
as
many
people
as
the
middle
west
yet
in
those
two
decades
the
middle
west
made
an
actual
gain
of
several
hundred
thousand
more
than
did
the
old
section
counties
in
the
newer
states
rose
from
a
few
hundred
to
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
people
in
the
space
of
less
than
five
years
suddenly
with
astonishing
rapidity
and
volume
a
new
people
was
forming
with
varied
elements
ideals
and
institutions
drawn
from
all
over
this
nation
and
from
europe
they
were
confronted
with
the
problem
of
adjusting
different
stocks
varied
customs
and
habits
to
their
new
home
in
comparison
with
the
ohio
valley
the
peculiarity
of
the
occupation
of
the
northern
zone
of
the
middle
west
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
native
element
was
predominantly
from
the
older
settlements
of
the
middle
west
itself
and
from
new
york
and
new
england
but
it
was
from
the
central
and
western
counties
of
new
york
and
from
the
western
and
northern
parts
of
new
england
the
rural
regions
of
declining
agricultural
prosperity
that
the
bulk
of
this
element
came
thus
the
influence
of
the
middle
west
stretched
into
the
northeast
and
attracted
a
farming
population
already
suffering
from
western
competition
the
advantage
of
abundant
fertile
and
cheap
land
the
richer
agricultural
returns
and
especially
the
opportunities
for
youth
to
rise
in
all
the
trades
and
professions
gave
strength
to
this
competition
by
it
new
england
was
profoundly
and
permanently
modified
this
yankee
stock
carried
with
it
a
habit
of
community
life
in
contrast
with
the
individualistic
democracy
of
the
southern
element
the
colonizing
land
companies
the
town
the
school
the
church
the
feeling
of
local
unity
furnished
the
evidences
of
this
instinct
for
communities
this
instinct
was
accompanied
by
the
creation
of
cities
the
production
of
a
surplus
for
market
the
reaching
out
to
connections
with
the
trading
centers
of
the
east
the
evolution
of
a
more
complex
and
at
the
same
time
a
more
integrated
industrial
society
than
that
of
the
southern
pioneer
but
they
did
not
carry
with
them
the
unmodified
new
england
institutions
and
traits
they
came
at
a
time
and
from
a
people
less
satisfied
with
the
old
order
than
were
their
neighbors
in
the
east
they
were
the
young
men
with
initiative
with
discontent
the
new
york
element
especially
was
affected
by
the
radicalism
of
locofoco
democracy
which
was
in
itself
a
protest
against
the
established
order
the
winds
of
the
prairies
swept
away
almost
at
once
a
mass
of
old
habits
and
prepossessions
said
one
of
these
pioneers
in
a
letter
to
friends
in
the
east
if
you
value
ease
more
than
money
or
prosperity
come
hands
are
too
few
for
the
work
houses
for
the
inhabitants
and
days
for
the
day
work
to
be
done
next
if
you
ca
stand
seeing
your
old
new
england
ideas
ways
of
doing
and
living
and
in
fact
all
of
the
good
old
yankee
fashions
knocked
out
of
shape
and
altered
or
thrown
by
as
unsuited
to
the
climate
do
be
caught
out
here
but
if
you
can
bear
grief
with
a
smile
can
put
up
with
a
scale
of
accommodations
ranging
from
the
soft
side
of
a
plank
before
the
fire
and
perhaps
three
in
a
bed
at
that
down
through
the
middling
and
inferior
grades
if
you
are
never
at
a
loss
for
ways
to
do
the
most
unpracticable
things
without
tools
if
you
can
do
all
this
and
some
more
come
on
it
is
a
universal
rule
here
to
help
one
another
each
one
keeping
an
eye
single
to
his
own
business
they
knew
that
they
were
leaving
many
dear
associations
of
the
old
home
giving
up
many
of
the
comforts
of
life
sacrificing
things
which
those
who
remained
thought
too
vital
to
civilization
to
be
left
but
they
were
not
mere
materialists
ready
to
surrender
all
that
life
is
worth
for
immediate
gain
they
were
idealists
themselves
sacrificing
the
ease
of
the
immediate
future
for
the
welfare
of
their
children
and
convinced
of
the
possibility
of
helping
to
bring
about
a
better
social
order
and
a
freer
life
they
were
social
idealists
but
they
based
their
ideals
on
trust
in
the
common
man
and
the
readiness
to
make
adjustments
not
on
the
rule
of
a
benevolent
despot
or
a
controlling
class
the
attraction
of
this
new
home
reached
also
into
the
old
world
and
gave
a
new
hope
and
new
impulses
to
the
people
of
germany
of
england
of
ireland
and
of
scandinavia
both
economic
influences
and
revolutionary
discontent
promoted
german
migration
at
this
time
economic
causes
brought
the
larger
volume
but
the
quest
for
liberty
brought
the
leaders
many
of
whom
were
german
political
exiles
while
the
latter
urged
with
varying
degrees
of
emphasis
that
their
own
contribution
should
be
preserved
in
their
new
surroundings
and
a
few
visionaries
even
talked
of
a
german
state
in
the
federal
system
what
was
noteworthy
was
the
adjustment
of
the
emigrants
of
the
thirties
and
forties
to
middle
western
conditions
the
response
to
the
opportunity
to
create
a
new
type
of
society
in
which
all
gave
and
all
received
and
no
element
remained
isolated
society
was
plastic
in
the
midst
of
more
or
less
antagonism
between
bowie
knife
southerners
yankee
puritans
germans
wild
irishmen
a
process
of
mutual
education
a
giving
and
taking
was
at
work
in
the
outcome
in
spite
of
slowness
of
assimilation
where
different
groups
were
compact
and
isolated
from
the
others
and
a
certain
persistence
of
inherited
there
was
the
creation
of
a
new
type
which
was
neither
the
sum
of
all
its
elements
nor
a
complete
fusion
in
a
melting
pot
they
were
american
pioneers
not
outlying
fragments
of
new
england
of
germany
or
of
norway
the
germans
were
most
strongly
represented
in
the
missouri
valley
in
louis
in
illinois
opposite
that
city
and
in
the
lake
shore
counties
of
eastern
wisconsin
north
from
milwaukee
in
cincinnati
and
cleveland
there
were
many
germans
while
in
nearly
half
the
counties
of
ohio
the
german
immigrants
and
the
pennsylvania
germans
held
nearly
or
quite
the
balance
of
political
power
the
irish
came
primarily
as
workers
on
turnpikes
canals
and
railroads
and
tended
to
remain
along
such
lines
or
to
gather
in
the
growing
cities
the
scandinavians
of
whom
the
largest
proportion
were
norwegians
founded
their
colonies
in
northern
illinois
and
in
southern
wisconsin
about
the
fox
and
the
head
waters
of
rock
river
whence
in
later
years
they
spread
into
iowa
minnesota
and
north
dakota
by
about
of
the
people
of
the
middle
west
were
of
north
atlantic
birth
about
of
southern
birth
and
a
like
fraction
of
foreign
birth
of
whom
the
germans
were
twice
as
numerous
as
the
irish
and
the
scandinavians
only
slightly
more
numerous
than
the
welsh
and
fewer
than
the
scotch
there
were
only
a
dozen
scandinavians
in
minnesota
the
natives
of
the
british
islands
together
with
the
natives
of
british
north
america
in
the
middle
west
numbered
nearly
as
many
as
the
natives
of
german
lands
but
in
almost
of
the
population
were
natives
of
the
middle
west
itself
and
over
a
third
of
the
population
lived
in
ohio
the
cities
were
especially
a
mixture
of
peoples
in
the
five
larger
cities
of
the
section
natives
and
foreigners
were
nearly
balanced
in
chicago
the
irish
germans
and
natives
of
the
north
atlantic
states
about
equaled
each
other
but
in
all
the
other
cities
the
germans
exceeded
the
irish
in
varying
proportions
there
were
nearly
three
to
one
in
milwaukee
it
is
not
merely
that
the
section
was
growing
rapidly
and
was
made
up
of
various
stocks
with
many
different
cultures
sectional
and
european
what
is
more
significant
is
that
these
elements
did
not
remain
as
separate
strata
underneath
an
established
ruling
order
as
was
the
case
particularly
in
new
england
all
were
accepted
and
intermingling
components
of
a
forming
society
plastic
and
absorptive
this
characteristic
of
the
section
as
a
good
mixer
became
fixed
before
the
large
immigrations
of
the
eighties
the
foundations
of
the
section
were
laid
firmly
in
a
period
when
the
foreign
elements
were
particularly
free
and
eager
to
contribute
to
a
new
society
and
to
receive
an
impress
from
the
country
which
offered
them
a
liberty
denied
abroad
significant
as
is
this
fact
and
influential
in
the
solution
of
america
present
problems
it
is
no
more
important
than
the
fact
that
in
the
decade
before
the
civil
war
the
southern
element
in
the
middle
west
had
also
had
nearly
two
generations
of
direct
association
with
the
northern
and
had
finally
been
engulfed
in
a
tide
of
northeastern
and
old
world
settlers
in
this
society
of
pioneers
men
learned
to
drop
their
old
national
animosities
one
of
the
immigrant
guides
of
the
fifties
urged
the
newcomers
to
abandon
their
racial
animosities
the
american
laughs
at
these
steerage
quarrels
said
the
author
thus
the
middle
west
was
teaching
the
lesson
of
national
instead
of
national
enmities
the
possibility
of
a
newer
and
richer
civilization
not
by
preserving
unmodified
or
isolated
the
old
component
elements
but
by
breaking
down
the
by
merging
the
individual
life
in
the
common
product
a
new
product
which
held
the
promise
of
world
brotherhood
if
the
pioneers
divided
their
allegiance
between
various
parties
whig
democrat
free
soil
or
republican
it
does
not
follow
that
the
western
whig
was
like
the
eastern
whig
there
was
an
infiltration
of
a
western
quality
into
all
of
these
the
western
whig
supported
harrison
more
because
he
was
a
pioneer
than
because
he
was
a
whig
it
saw
in
him
a
legitimate
successor
of
andrew
jackson
the
campaign
of
was
a
middle
western
camp
meeting
on
a
huge
scale
the
log
cabins
the
cider
and
the
coonskins
were
the
symbols
of
the
triumph
of
middle
western
ideas
and
were
carried
with
misgivings
by
the
merchants
the
bankers
and
the
manufacturers
of
the
east
in
like
fashion
the
middle
western
wing
of
the
democratic
party
was
as
different
from
the
southern
wing
wherein
lay
its
strength
as
douglas
was
from
calhoun
it
had
little
in
common
with
the
slaveholding
classes
of
the
south
even
while
it
felt
the
kinship
of
the
pioneer
with
the
people
of
the
southern
upland
stock
from
which
so
many
westerners
were
descended
in
the
later
forties
and
early
fifties
most
of
the
middle
western
states
made
constitutions
the
debates
in
their
conventions
and
the
results
embodied
in
the
constitutions
themselves
tell
the
story
of
their
political
ideals
of
course
they
based
the
franchise
on
the
principle
of
manhood
suffrage
but
they
also
provided
for
an
elective
judiciary
for
restrictions
on
the
borrowing
power
of
the
state
lest
it
fall
under
the
control
of
what
they
feared
as
the
money
power
and
several
of
them
either
provided
for
the
extinguishment
of
banks
of
issue
or
rigidly
restrained
them
some
of
them
exempted
the
homestead
from
forced
sale
for
debt
married
women
legal
rights
were
prominent
topics
in
the
debates
of
the
conventions
and
wisconsin
led
off
by
permitting
the
alien
to
vote
after
a
year
residence
it
welcomed
the
newcomer
to
the
freedom
and
to
the
obligations
of
american
citizenship
although
this
pioneer
society
was
preponderantly
an
agricultural
society
it
was
rapidly
learning
that
agriculture
alone
was
not
sufficient
for
its
life
it
was
developing
manufactures
trade
mining
the
professions
and
becoming
conscious
that
in
a
progressive
modern
state
it
was
possible
to
pass
from
one
industry
to
another
and
that
all
were
bound
by
common
ties
but
it
is
significant
that
in
the
census
of
ohio
out
of
a
population
of
two
millions
reported
only
a
thousand
servants
iowa
only
ten
in
two
hundred
thousand
and
minnesota
fifteen
in
its
six
thousand
in
the
intellectual
life
of
this
new
democracy
there
was
already
the
promise
of
original
contributions
even
in
the
midst
of
the
engrossing
toil
and
hard
life
of
the
pioneer
the
country
editor
was
a
leader
of
his
people
not
a
recorder
of
social
functions
but
a
vigorous
and
independent
thinker
and
writer
the
subscribers
to
the
newspaper
published
in
the
section
were
higher
in
proportion
to
population
than
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
not
greatly
inferior
to
those
of
new
england
although
such
eastern
papers
as
the
york
had
an
extensive
circulation
throughout
the
middle
west
the
agricultural
press
presupposed
in
its
articles
and
contributions
a
level
of
general
intelligence
and
interest
above
that
of
the
later
farmers
of
the
section
at
least
before
the
present
day
farmer
boys
walked
behind
the
plow
with
their
book
in
hand
and
sometimes
forgot
to
turn
at
the
end
of
the
furrow
even
rare
boys
who
like
the
young
howells
limped
barefoot
by
his
father
side
with
his
eyes
on
the
cow
and
his
mind
on
cervantes
and
shakespeare
periodicals
flourished
and
faded
like
the
prairie
flowers
some
of
emerson
best
poems
first
appeared
in
one
of
these
ohio
valley
magazines
but
for
the
most
part
the
literature
of
the
region
and
the
period
was
imitative
or
reflective
of
the
common
things
in
a
not
uncommon
way
it
is
to
its
children
that
the
middle
west
had
to
look
for
the
expression
of
its
life
and
its
ideals
rather
than
to
the
busy
pioneer
who
was
breaking
a
prairie
farm
or
building
up
a
new
community
illiteracy
was
least
among
the
yankee
pioneers
and
highest
among
the
southern
element
when
illiteracy
is
mapped
for
by
percentages
there
appears
two
distinct
zones
the
one
extending
from
new
england
the
other
from
the
south
the
influence
of
new
england
men
was
strong
in
the
yankee
regions
of
the
middle
west
home
missionaries
and
representatives
of
societies
for
the
promotion
of
education
in
the
west
both
in
the
common
school
and
denominational
colleges
scattered
themselves
throughout
the
region
and
left
a
deep
impress
in
all
these
states
the
conception
was
firmly
fixed
in
the
thirties
and
forties
that
the
west
was
the
coming
power
in
the
union
that
the
fate
of
civilization
was
in
its
hands
and
therefore
rival
sects
and
rival
sections
strove
to
influence
it
to
their
own
types
but
the
middle
west
shaped
all
these
educational
contributions
according
to
her
own
needs
and
ideals
the
state
universities
were
for
the
most
part
the
result
of
agitation
and
proposals
of
men
of
new
england
origin
but
they
became
characteristic
products
of
middle
western
society
where
the
community
as
a
whole
rather
than
wealthy
benefactors
supported
these
institutions
in
the
end
the
community
determined
their
directions
in
accord
with
popular
ideals
they
reached
down
more
deeply
into
the
ranks
of
the
common
people
than
did
the
new
england
or
middle
state
colleges
they
laid
more
emphasis
upon
the
obviously
useful
and
became
coëducational
at
an
early
date
this
dominance
of
the
community
ideals
had
dangers
for
the
universities
which
were
called
to
raise
ideals
and
to
point
new
ways
rather
than
to
conform
challenging
the
spaces
of
the
west
struck
by
the
rapidity
with
which
a
new
society
was
unfolding
under
their
gaze
it
is
not
strange
that
the
pioneers
dealt
in
the
superlative
and
saw
their
destiny
with
optimistic
eyes
the
meadow
lot
of
the
small
intervale
had
become
the
prairie
stretching
farther
than
their
gaze
could
reach
all
was
motion
and
change
a
restlessness
was
universal
men
moved
in
their
single
life
from
vermont
to
new
york
from
new
york
to
ohio
from
ohio
to
wisconsin
from
wisconsin
to
california
and
longed
for
the
hawaiian
islands
when
the
bark
started
from
their
fence
rails
they
felt
the
call
to
change
they
were
conscious
of
the
mobility
of
their
society
and
gloried
in
it
they
broke
with
the
past
and
thought
to
create
something
finer
more
fitting
for
humanity
more
beneficial
for
the
average
man
than
the
world
had
ever
seen
with
the
past
we
have
literally
nothing
to
do
said
gratz
brown
in
a
missouri
fourth
of
july
oration
in
save
to
dream
of
it
its
lessons
are
lost
and
its
tongue
is
silent
we
are
ourselves
at
the
head
and
front
of
all
political
experience
precedents
have
lost
their
virtue
and
all
their
authority
is
gone
experience
can
profit
us
only
to
guard
from
antequated
delusions
the
yoke
of
opinion
wrote
channing
to
a
western
friend
speaking
of
new
england
is
a
heavy
one
often
crushing
individuality
of
judgment
and
action
and
he
added
that
the
habits
rules
and
criticisms
under
which
he
had
grown
up
had
not
left
him
the
freedom
and
courage
which
are
needed
in
the
style
of
address
best
suited
to
the
western
people
channing
no
doubt
unduly
stressed
the
freedom
of
the
west
in
this
respect
the
frontier
had
its
own
conventions
and
prejudices
and
new
england
was
breaking
its
own
cake
of
custom
and
proclaiming
a
new
liberty
at
the
very
time
he
wrote
but
there
was
truth
in
the
eastern
thought
of
the
west
as
a
land
of
intellectual
toleration
one
which
questioned
the
old
order
of
things
and
made
innovation
its
very
creed
the
west
laid
emphasis
upon
the
practical
and
demanded
that
ideals
should
be
put
to
work
for
useful
ends
ideals
were
tested
by
their
direct
contributions
to
the
betterment
of
the
average
man
rather
than
by
the
production
of
the
man
of
exceptional
genius
and
distinction
for
in
fine
this
was
the
goal
of
the
middle
west
the
welfare
of
the
average
man
not
only
the
man
of
the
south
or
of
the
east
the
yankee
or
the
irishman
or
the
german
but
all
men
in
one
common
fellowship
this
was
the
hope
of
their
youth
of
that
youth
when
abraham
lincoln
rose
from
to
country
lawyer
from
illinois
legislator
to
congressman
and
from
congressman
to
president
it
is
not
strange
that
in
all
this
flux
and
freedom
and
novelty
and
vast
spaces
the
pioneer
did
not
sufficiently
consider
the
need
of
disciplined
devotion
to
the
government
which
he
himself
created
and
operated
but
the
name
of
lincoln
and
the
response
of
the
pioneer
to
the
duties
of
the
civil
war
to
the
sacrifices
and
the
restraints
on
freedom
which
it
entailed
under
his
presidency
reminds
us
that
they
knew
how
to
take
part
in
a
common
cause
even
while
they
knew
that
conditions
were
destructive
of
many
of
the
things
for
which
they
worked
there
are
two
kinds
of
governmental
discipline
that
which
proceeds
from
free
choice
in
the
conviction
that
restraint
of
individual
or
class
interests
is
necessary
for
the
common
good
and
that
which
is
imposed
by
a
dominant
class
upon
a
subjected
and
helpless
people
the
latter
is
prussian
discipline
the
discipline
of
a
harsh
logical
organization
based
on
the
rule
of
a
military
autocracy
it
assumes
that
if
you
do
not
crush
your
opponent
first
he
will
crush
you
it
is
the
discipline
of
a
nation
ruled
by
its
general
staff
assuming
war
as
the
normal
condition
of
peoples
and
attempting
with
remorseless
logic
to
extend
its
operations
to
the
destruction
of
freedom
everywhere
it
can
only
be
met
by
the
discipline
of
a
people
who
use
their
own
government
for
worthy
ends
who
preserve
individuality
and
mobility
in
society
and
respect
the
rights
of
others
who
follow
the
dictates
of
humanity
and
fair
play
the
principles
of
give
and
take
the
prussian
discipline
is
the
discipline
of
thor
the
war
god
against
the
discipline
of
the
white
christ
pioneer
democracy
has
had
to
learn
lessons
by
experience
the
lesson
that
government
on
principles
of
free
democracy
can
accomplish
many
things
which
the
men
of
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
did
not
realize
were
even
possible
they
have
had
to
sacrifice
something
of
their
passion
for
individual
unrestraint
they
have
had
to
learn
that
the
specially
trained
man
the
man
fitted
for
his
calling
by
education
and
experience
whether
in
the
field
of
science
or
of
industry
has
a
place
in
government
that
the
rule
of
the
people
is
effective
and
enduring
only
as
it
incorporates
the
trained
specialist
into
the
organization
of
that
government
whether
as
umpire
between
contending
interests
or
as
the
efficient
instrument
in
the
hands
of
democracy
organized
democracy
after
the
era
of
free
land
has
learned
that
popular
government
to
be
successful
must
not
only
be
legitimately
the
choice
of
the
whole
people
that
the
offices
of
that
government
must
not
only
be
open
to
all
but
that
in
the
fierce
struggle
of
nations
in
the
field
of
economic
competition
and
in
the
field
of
war
the
salvation
and
perpetuity
of
the
republic
depend
upon
recognition
of
the
fact
that
specialization
of
the
organs
of
the
government
the
choice
of
the
fit
and
the
capable
for
office
is
quite
as
important
as
the
extension
of
popular
control
when
we
lost
our
free
lands
and
our
isolation
from
the
old
world
we
lost
our
immunity
from
the
results
of
mistakes
of
waste
of
inefficiency
and
of
inexperience
in
our
government
but
in
the
present
day
we
are
also
learning
another
lesson
which
was
better
known
to
the
pioneers
than
to
their
immediate
successors
we
are
learning
that
the
distinction
arising
from
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
commonwealth
is
a
higher
distinction
than
mere
success
in
economic
competition
america
is
now
awarding
laurels
to
the
men
who
sacrifice
their
triumphs
in
the
rivalry
of
business
in
order
to
give
their
service
to
the
cause
of
a
nation
their
wealth
and
their
genius
to
the
success
of
her
ideals
that
craving
for
distinction
which
once
drew
men
to
pile
up
wealth
and
exhibit
power
over
the
industrial
processes
of
the
nation
is
now
finding
a
new
outlet
in
the
craving
for
distinction
that
comes
from
service
to
the
union
in
satisfaction
in
the
use
of
great
talent
for
the
good
of
the
republic
and
all
over
the
nation
in
voluntary
organizations
for
aid
to
the
government
is
being
shown
the
pioneer
principle
of
association
that
was
expressed
in
the
house
raising
it
is
shown
in
the
red
cross
the
the
knights
of
columbus
the
councils
and
boards
of
science
commerce
labor
agriculture
and
in
all
the
countless
other
types
from
the
association
of
women
in
their
kitchen
who
carry
out
the
recommendations
of
the
food
director
and
revive
the
plain
living
of
the
pioneer
to
the
boy
scouts
who
are
laying
the
foundations
for
a
and
virile
generation
worthy
to
follow
the
trail
of
the
backwoodsmen
it
is
an
inspiring
prophecy
of
the
revival
of
the
old
pioneer
conception
of
the
obligations
and
opportunities
of
neighborliness
broadening
to
a
national
and
even
to
an
international
scope
the
promise
of
what
that
wise
and
lamented
philosopher
josiah
royce
called
the
beloved
community
in
the
spirit
of
the
house
raising
lies
the
salvation
of
the
republic
this
then
is
the
heritage
of
pioneer
experience
a
passionate
belief
that
a
democracy
was
possible
which
should
leave
the
individual
a
part
to
play
in
free
society
and
not
make
him
a
cog
in
a
machine
operated
from
above
which
trusted
in
the
common
man
in
his
tolerance
his
ability
to
adjust
differences
with
good
humor
and
to
work
out
an
american
type
from
the
contributions
of
all
nations
a
type
for
which
he
would
fight
against
those
who
challenged
it
in
arms
and
for
which
in
time
of
war
he
would
make
sacrifices
even
the
temporary
sacrifice
of
individual
freedom
and
his
life
lest
that
freedom
be
lost
forever
