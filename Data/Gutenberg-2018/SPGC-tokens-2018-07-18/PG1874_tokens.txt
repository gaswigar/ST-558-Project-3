i
the
beginning
of
things
they
were
not
railway
children
to
begin
with
i
do
suppose
they
had
ever
thought
about
railways
except
as
a
means
of
getting
to
maskelyne
and
cook
the
pantomime
zoological
gardens
and
madame
tussaud
they
were
just
ordinary
suburban
children
and
they
lived
with
their
father
and
mother
in
an
ordinary
villa
with
coloured
glass
in
the
front
door
a
tiled
passage
that
was
called
a
hall
a
with
hot
and
cold
water
electric
bells
french
windows
and
a
good
deal
of
white
paint
and
modern
convenience
as
the
say
there
were
three
of
them
roberta
was
the
eldest
of
course
mothers
never
have
favourites
but
if
their
mother
had
had
a
favourite
it
might
have
been
roberta
next
came
peter
who
wished
to
be
an
engineer
when
he
grew
up
and
the
youngest
was
phyllis
who
meant
extremely
well
mother
did
not
spend
all
her
time
in
paying
dull
calls
to
dull
ladies
and
sitting
dully
at
home
waiting
for
dull
ladies
to
pay
calls
to
her
she
was
almost
always
there
ready
to
play
with
the
children
and
read
to
them
and
help
them
to
do
their
besides
this
she
used
to
write
stories
for
them
while
they
were
at
school
and
read
them
aloud
after
tea
and
she
always
made
up
funny
pieces
of
poetry
for
their
birthdays
and
for
other
great
occasions
such
as
the
christening
of
the
new
kittens
or
the
refurnishing
of
the
doll
house
or
the
time
when
they
were
getting
over
the
mumps
these
three
lucky
children
always
had
everything
they
needed
pretty
clothes
good
fires
a
lovely
nursery
with
heaps
of
toys
and
a
mother
goose
they
had
a
kind
and
merry
nursemaid
and
a
dog
who
was
called
james
and
who
was
their
very
own
they
also
had
a
father
who
was
just
perfect
never
cross
never
unjust
and
always
ready
for
a
game
at
least
if
at
any
time
he
was
not
ready
he
always
had
an
excellent
reason
for
it
and
explained
the
reason
to
the
children
so
interestingly
and
funnily
that
they
felt
sure
he
could
help
himself
you
will
think
that
they
ought
to
have
been
very
happy
and
so
they
were
but
they
did
not
know
how
happy
till
the
pretty
life
in
the
red
villa
was
over
and
done
with
and
they
had
to
live
a
very
different
life
indeed
the
dreadful
change
came
quite
suddenly
peter
had
a
birthday
his
tenth
among
his
other
presents
was
a
model
engine
more
perfect
than
you
could
ever
have
dreamed
of
the
other
presents
were
full
of
charm
but
the
engine
was
fuller
of
charm
than
any
of
the
others
were
its
charm
lasted
in
its
full
perfection
for
exactly
three
days
then
owing
either
to
peter
inexperience
or
phyllis
good
intentions
which
had
been
rather
pressing
or
to
some
other
cause
the
engine
suddenly
went
off
with
a
bang
james
was
so
frightened
that
he
went
out
and
did
not
come
back
all
day
all
the
noah
ark
people
who
were
in
the
tender
were
broken
to
bits
but
nothing
else
was
hurt
except
the
poor
little
engine
and
the
feelings
of
peter
the
others
said
he
cried
over
it
but
of
course
boys
of
ten
do
not
cry
however
terrible
the
tragedies
may
be
which
darken
their
lot
he
said
that
his
eyes
were
red
because
he
had
a
cold
this
turned
out
to
be
true
though
peter
did
not
know
it
was
when
he
said
it
the
next
day
he
had
to
go
to
bed
and
stay
there
mother
began
to
be
afraid
that
he
might
be
sickening
for
measles
when
suddenly
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
said
i
hate
gruel
i
hate
barley
water
i
hate
bread
and
milk
i
want
to
get
up
and
have
something
real
to
what
would
you
like
mother
asked
a
said
peter
eagerly
a
large
a
very
large
so
mother
asked
the
cook
to
make
a
large
the
pie
was
made
and
when
the
pie
was
made
it
was
cooked
and
when
it
was
cooked
peter
ate
some
of
it
after
that
his
cold
was
better
mother
made
a
piece
of
poetry
to
amuse
him
while
the
pie
was
being
made
it
began
by
saying
what
an
unfortunate
but
worthy
boy
peter
was
then
it
went
on
he
had
an
engine
that
he
loved
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
and
if
he
had
a
wish
on
earth
it
was
to
keep
it
whole
one
day
my
friends
prepare
your
minds
i
coming
to
the
worst
quite
suddenly
a
screw
went
mad
and
then
the
boiler
burst
with
gloomy
face
he
picked
it
up
and
took
it
to
his
mother
though
even
he
could
not
suppose
that
she
could
make
another
for
those
who
perished
on
the
line
he
did
not
seem
to
care
his
engine
being
more
to
him
than
all
the
people
there
and
now
you
see
the
reason
why
our
peter
has
been
ill
he
soothes
his
soul
with
his
gnawing
grief
to
kill
he
wraps
himself
in
blankets
warm
and
sleeps
in
bed
till
late
determined
thus
to
overcome
his
miserable
fate
and
if
his
eyes
are
rather
red
his
cold
must
just
excuse
it
offer
him
pie
you
may
be
sure
he
never
will
refuse
it
father
had
been
away
in
the
country
for
three
or
four
days
all
hopes
for
the
curing
of
his
afflicted
engine
were
now
fixed
on
his
father
for
father
was
most
wonderfully
clever
with
his
fingers
he
could
mend
all
sorts
of
things
he
had
often
acted
as
veterinary
surgeon
to
the
wooden
once
he
had
saved
its
life
when
all
human
aid
was
despaired
of
and
the
poor
creature
was
given
up
for
lost
and
even
the
carpenter
said
he
did
see
his
way
to
do
anything
and
it
was
father
who
mended
the
doll
cradle
when
no
one
else
could
and
with
a
little
glue
and
some
bits
of
wood
and
a
made
all
the
ark
beasts
as
strong
on
their
pins
as
ever
they
were
if
not
stronger
peter
with
heroic
unselfishness
did
not
say
anything
about
his
engine
till
after
father
had
had
his
dinner
and
his
cigar
the
unselfishness
was
mother
idea
but
it
was
peter
who
carried
it
out
and
needed
a
good
deal
of
patience
too
at
last
mother
said
to
father
now
dear
if
you
quite
rested
and
quite
comfy
we
want
to
tell
you
about
the
great
railway
accident
and
ask
your
all
right
said
father
fire
away
so
then
peter
told
the
sad
tale
and
fetched
what
was
left
of
the
engine
hum
said
father
when
he
had
looked
the
engine
over
very
carefully
the
children
held
their
breaths
is
there
no
hope
said
peter
in
a
low
unsteady
voice
hope
rather
tons
of
it
said
father
cheerfully
but
it
want
something
besides
hope
a
bit
of
brazing
say
or
some
solder
and
a
new
valve
i
think
we
better
keep
it
for
a
rainy
day
in
other
words
give
up
saturday
afternoon
to
it
and
you
shall
all
help
can
girls
help
to
mend
engines
peter
asked
doubtfully
of
course
they
can
girls
are
just
as
clever
as
boys
and
do
you
forget
it
how
would
you
like
to
be
an
phil
my
face
would
be
always
dirty
would
it
said
phyllis
in
unenthusiastic
tones
and
i
expect
i
should
break
i
should
just
love
it
said
roberta
do
you
think
i
could
when
grown
up
daddy
or
even
a
stoker
you
mean
a
fireman
said
daddy
pulling
and
twisting
at
the
engine
well
if
you
still
wish
it
when
you
grown
up
we
see
about
making
you
a
i
remember
when
i
was
a
boy
just
then
there
was
a
knock
at
the
front
door
who
on
earth
said
father
an
englishman
house
is
his
castle
of
course
but
i
do
wish
they
built
villas
with
moats
and
ruth
she
was
the
and
had
red
hair
came
in
and
said
that
two
gentlemen
wanted
to
see
the
master
i
shown
them
into
the
library
sir
said
she
i
expect
it
the
subscription
to
the
vicar
testimonial
said
mother
or
else
it
the
choir
holiday
fund
get
rid
of
them
quickly
dear
it
does
break
up
an
evening
so
and
it
nearly
the
but
father
did
not
seem
to
be
able
to
get
rid
of
the
gentlemen
at
all
quickly
i
wish
we
had
got
a
moat
and
drawbridge
said
roberta
then
when
we
did
want
people
we
could
just
pull
up
the
drawbridge
and
no
one
else
could
get
in
i
expect
father
will
have
forgotten
about
when
he
was
a
boy
if
they
stay
much
mother
tried
to
make
the
time
pass
by
telling
them
a
new
fairy
story
about
a
princess
with
green
eyes
but
it
was
difficult
because
they
could
hear
the
voices
of
father
and
the
gentlemen
in
the
library
and
father
voice
sounded
louder
and
different
to
the
voice
he
generally
used
to
people
who
came
about
testimonials
and
holiday
funds
then
the
library
bell
rang
and
everyone
heaved
a
breath
of
relief
they
going
now
said
phyllis
he
rung
to
have
them
shown
but
instead
of
showing
anybody
out
ruth
showed
herself
in
and
she
looked
queer
the
children
thought
please
she
said
the
master
wants
you
to
just
step
into
the
study
he
looks
like
the
dead
mum
i
think
he
had
bad
news
you
best
prepare
yourself
for
the
worst
it
a
death
in
the
family
or
a
bank
busted
or
that
do
ruth
said
mother
gently
you
can
then
mother
went
into
the
library
there
was
more
talking
then
the
bell
rang
again
and
ruth
fetched
a
cab
the
children
heard
boots
go
out
and
down
the
steps
the
cab
drove
away
and
the
front
door
shut
then
mother
came
in
her
dear
face
was
as
white
as
her
lace
collar
and
her
eyes
looked
very
big
and
shining
her
mouth
looked
like
just
a
line
of
pale
red
her
lips
were
thin
and
not
their
proper
shape
at
all
it
bedtime
she
said
ruth
will
put
you
to
but
you
promised
we
should
sit
up
late
tonight
because
father
come
home
said
phyllis
father
been
called
away
on
business
said
mother
come
darlings
go
at
they
kissed
her
and
went
roberta
lingered
to
give
mother
an
extra
hug
and
to
whisper
it
was
bad
news
mammy
was
it
is
anyone
dead
or
nobody
dead
no
said
mother
and
she
almost
seemed
to
push
roberta
away
i
ca
tell
you
anything
tonight
my
pet
go
dear
go
so
roberta
went
ruth
brushed
the
girls
hair
and
helped
them
to
undress
mother
almost
always
did
this
herself
when
she
had
turned
down
the
gas
and
left
them
she
found
peter
still
dressed
waiting
on
the
stairs
i
say
ruth
what
up
he
asked
do
ask
me
no
questions
and
i
wo
tell
you
no
lies
the
ruth
replied
you
know
soon
late
that
night
mother
came
up
and
kissed
all
three
children
as
they
lay
asleep
but
roberta
was
the
only
one
whom
the
kiss
woke
and
she
lay
and
said
nothing
if
mother
does
want
us
to
know
she
been
crying
she
said
to
herself
as
she
heard
through
the
dark
the
catching
of
her
breath
we
wo
know
it
that
when
they
came
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
mother
had
already
gone
out
to
london
ruth
said
and
left
them
to
their
breakfast
there
something
awful
the
matter
said
peter
breaking
his
egg
ruth
told
me
last
night
we
should
know
soon
did
you
ask
her
said
roberta
with
scorn
yes
i
did
said
peter
angrily
if
you
could
go
to
bed
without
caring
whether
mother
was
worried
or
not
i
could
so
i
do
think
we
ought
to
ask
the
servants
things
mother
does
tell
us
said
roberta
that
right
miss
said
peter
preach
i
not
goody
said
phyllis
but
i
think
bobbie
right
this
of
course
she
always
is
in
her
own
opinion
said
peter
oh
do
cried
roberta
putting
down
her
do
let
be
horrid
to
each
other
i
sure
some
dire
calamity
is
happening
let
make
it
worse
who
began
i
should
like
to
know
said
peter
roberta
made
an
effort
and
answered
i
did
i
suppose
but
well
then
said
peter
triumphantly
but
before
he
went
to
school
he
thumped
his
sister
between
the
shoulders
and
told
her
to
cheer
up
the
children
came
home
to
one
dinner
but
mother
was
not
there
and
she
was
not
there
at
it
was
nearly
seven
before
she
came
in
looking
so
ill
and
tired
that
the
children
felt
they
could
not
ask
her
any
questions
she
sank
into
an
phyllis
took
the
long
pins
out
of
her
hat
while
roberta
took
off
her
gloves
and
peter
unfastened
her
and
fetched
her
soft
velvety
slippers
for
her
when
she
had
had
a
cup
of
tea
and
roberta
had
put
on
her
poor
head
that
ached
mother
said
now
my
darlings
i
want
to
tell
you
something

men

night

bring
very
bad
news
and
father

some
time
i
am
very
worried
about
it
and
i
want
you
all
to
help
me
and
not
to
make
things
harder
for
as
if
we
would
said
roberta
holding
mother
hand
against
her
face
you
can
help
me
very
much
said
mother
by
being
good
and
happy
and
not
quarrelling
when
i
away
roberta
and
peter
exchanged
guilty
glances
for
i
shall
have
to
be
away
a
good
we
wo
quarrel
indeed
we
wo
said
everybody
and
meant
it
too
then
mother
went
on
i
want
you
not
to
ask
me
any
questions
about
this
trouble
and
not
to
ask
anybody
else
any
peter
cringed
and
shuffled
his
boots
on
the
carpet
you
promise
this
too
wo
you
said
mother
i
did
ask
ruth
said
peter
suddenly
i
very
sorry
but
i
and
what
did
she
say
she
said
i
should
know
soon
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
know
anything
about
it
said
mother
it
about
business
and
you
never
do
understand
business
do
you
no
said
roberta
is
it
something
to
do
with
government
for
father

in
a
government
office

said
mother
now
it
my
darlings
and
do

mother
said
phyllis
and
we
all
be
as
good
as
mother
sighed
and
kissed
them
we
begin
being
good
the
first
thing
tomorrow
morning
said
peter
as
they
went
upstairs
why
not
now
said
roberta
there
nothing
to
be
good
about
now
silly
said
peter
we
might
begin
to
try
to
feel
good
said
phyllis
and
not
call
who
calling
names
said
peter
bobbie
knows
right
enough
that
when
i
say
it
just
the
same
as
if
i
said
well
said
roberta
no
i
do
mean
what
you
mean
i
mean
it
just
a
what
is
it
father
calls
it
a
germ
of
endearment
good
the
girls
folded
up
their
clothes
with
more
than
usual
neatness
which
was
the
only
way
of
being
good
that
they
could
think
of
i
say
said
phyllis
smoothing
out
her
pinafore
you
used
to
say
it
was
so
dull
nothing
happening
like
in
books
now
something
has
i
never
wanted
things
to
happen
to
make
mother
unhappy
said
roberta
everything
perfectly
everything
continued
to
be
perfectly
horrid
for
some
weeks
mother
was
nearly
always
out
meals
were
dull
and
dirty
the
was
sent
away
and
aunt
emma
came
on
a
visit
aunt
emma
was
much
older
than
mother
she
was
going
abroad
to
be
a
governess
she
was
very
busy
getting
her
clothes
ready
and
they
were
very
ugly
dingy
clothes
and
she
had
them
always
littering
about
and
the
seemed
to
whir
on
and
on
all
day
and
most
of
the
night
aunt
emma
believed
in
keeping
children
in
their
proper
places
and
they
more
than
returned
the
compliment
their
idea
of
aunt
emma
proper
place
was
anywhere
where
they
were
not
so
they
saw
very
little
of
her
they
preferred
the
company
of
the
servants
who
were
more
amusing
cook
if
in
a
good
temper
could
sing
comic
songs
and
the
housemaid
if
she
happened
not
to
be
offended
with
you
could
imitate
a
hen
that
has
laid
an
egg
a
bottle
of
champagne
being
opened
and
could
mew
like
two
cats
fighting
the
servants
never
told
the
children
what
the
bad
news
was
that
the
gentlemen
had
brought
to
father
but
they
kept
hinting
that
they
could
tell
a
great
deal
if
they
chose
and
this
was
not
comfortable
one
day
when
peter
had
made
a
booby
trap
over
the
door
and
it
had
acted
beautifully
as
ruth
passed
through
that
caught
him
and
boxed
his
ears
you
come
to
a
bad
end
she
said
furiously
you
nasty
little
limb
you
if
you
do
mend
your
ways
you
go
where
your
precious
gone
so
i
tell
you
straight
roberta
repeated
this
to
her
mother
and
next
day
ruth
was
sent
away
then
came
the
time
when
mother
came
home
and
went
to
bed
and
stayed
there
two
days
and
the
doctor
came
and
the
children
crept
wretchedly
about
the
house
and
wondered
if
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
mother
came
down
one
morning
to
breakfast
very
pale
and
with
lines
on
her
face
that
used
not
to
be
there
and
she
smiled
as
well
as
she
could
and
said
now
my
pets
everything
is
settled
we
going
to
leave
this
house
and
go
and
live
in
the
country
such
a
ducky
dear
little
white
house
i
know
you
love
a
whirling
week
of
packing
followed
not
just
packing
clothes
like
when
you
go
to
the
seaside
but
packing
chairs
and
tables
covering
their
tops
with
sacking
and
their
legs
with
straw
all
sorts
of
things
were
packed
that
you
do
pack
when
you
go
to
the
seaside
crockery
blankets
candlesticks
carpets
bedsteads
saucepans
and
even
fenders
and
the
house
was
like
a
furniture
warehouse
i
think
the
children
enjoyed
it
very
much
mother
was
very
busy
but
not
too
busy
now
to
talk
to
them
and
read
to
them
and
even
to
make
a
bit
of
poetry
for
phyllis
to
cheer
her
up
when
she
fell
down
with
a
screwdriver
and
ran
it
into
her
hand
are
you
going
to
pack
this
mother
roberta
asked
pointing
to
the
beautiful
cabinet
inlaid
with
red
turtleshell
and
brass
we
ca
take
everything
said
mother
but
we
seem
to
be
taking
all
the
ugly
things
said
roberta
we
taking
the
useful
ones
said
mother
we
got
to
play
at
being
poor
for
a
bit
my
when
all
the
ugly
useful
things
had
been
packed
up
and
taken
away
in
a
van
by
men
in
aprons
the
two
girls
and
mother
and
aunt
emma
slept
in
the
two
spare
rooms
where
the
furniture
was
all
pretty
all
their
beds
had
gone
a
bed
was
made
up
for
peter
on
the
sofa
i
say
this
is
larks
he
said
wriggling
joyously
as
mother
tucked
him
up
i
do
like
moving
i
wish
we
moved
once
a
mother
laughed
i
do
she
said
good
night
as
she
turned
away
roberta
saw
her
face
she
never
forgot
it
oh
mother
she
whispered
all
to
herself
as
she
got
into
bed
how
brave
you
are
how
i
love
you
fancy
being
brave
enough
to
laugh
when
you
feeling
like
that
next
day
boxes
were
filled
and
boxes
and
more
boxes
and
then
late
in
the
afternoon
a
cab
came
to
take
them
to
the
station
aunt
emma
saw
them
off
they
felt
that
they
were
seeing
her
off
and
they
were
glad
of
it
but
oh
those
poor
little
foreign
children
that
she
going
to
governess
whispered
phyllis
i
would
be
them
for
anything
at
first
they
enjoyed
looking
out
of
the
window
but
when
it
grew
dusk
they
grew
sleepier
and
sleepier
and
no
one
knew
how
long
they
had
been
in
the
train
when
they
were
roused
by
mother
shaking
them
gently
and
saying
wake
up
dears
we
they
woke
up
cold
and
melancholy
and
stood
shivering
on
the
draughty
platform
while
the
baggage
was
taken
out
of
the
train
then
the
engine
puffing
and
blowing
set
to
work
again
and
dragged
the
train
away
the
children
watched
the
of
the
guard
van
disappear
into
the
darkness
this
was
the
first
train
the
children
saw
on
that
railway
which
was
in
time
to
become
so
very
dear
to
them
they
did
not
guess
then
how
they
would
grow
to
love
the
railway
and
how
soon
it
would
become
the
centre
of
their
new
life
nor
what
wonders
and
changes
it
would
bring
to
them
they
only
shivered
and
sneezed
and
hoped
the
walk
to
the
new
house
would
not
be
long
peter
nose
was
colder
than
he
ever
remembered
it
to
have
been
before
roberta
hat
was
crooked
and
the
elastic
seemed
tighter
than
usual
phyllis
had
come
undone
come
said
mother
we
got
to
walk
there
are
any
cabs
the
walk
was
dark
and
muddy
the
children
stumbled
a
little
on
the
rough
road
and
once
phyllis
absently
fell
into
a
puddle
and
was
picked
up
damp
and
unhappy
there
were
no
on
the
road
and
the
road
was
uphill
the
cart
went
at
a
foot
pace
and
they
followed
the
gritty
crunch
of
its
wheels
as
their
eyes
got
used
to
the
darkness
they
could
see
the
mound
of
boxes
swaying
dimly
in
front
of
them
a
long
gate
had
to
be
opened
for
the
cart
to
pass
through
and
after
that
the
road
seemed
to
go
across
fields
and
now
it
went
down
hill
presently
a
great
dark
lumpish
thing
showed
over
to
the
right
there
the
house
said
mother
i
wonder
why
she
shut
the
who
she
asked
roberta
the
woman
i
engaged
to
clean
the
place
and
put
the
furniture
straight
and
get
there
was
a
low
wall
and
trees
inside
that
the
garden
said
mother
it
looks
more
like
a
full
of
black
cabbages
said
peter
the
cart
went
on
along
by
the
garden
wall
and
round
to
the
back
of
the
house
and
here
it
clattered
into
a
yard
and
stopped
at
the
back
door
there
was
no
light
in
any
of
the
windows
everyone
hammered
at
the
door
but
no
one
came
the
man
who
drove
the
cart
said
he
expected
viney
had
gone
home
you
see
your
train
was
that
late
said
he
but
she
got
the
key
said
mother
what
are
we
to
do
oh
she
have
left
that
under
the
doorstep
said
the
cart
man
folks
do
he
took
the
lantern
off
his
cart
and
stooped
ay
here
it
is
right
enough
he
said
he
unlocked
the
door
and
went
in
and
set
his
lantern
on
the
table
got
a
candle
said
he
i
do
know
where
anything
mother
spoke
rather
less
cheerfully
than
usual
he
struck
a
match
there
was
a
candle
on
the
table
and
he
lighted
it
by
its
thin
little
glimmer
the
children
saw
a
large
bare
kitchen
with
a
stone
floor
there
were
no
curtains
no
the
kitchen
table
from
home
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
chairs
were
in
one
corner
and
the
pots
pans
brooms
and
crockery
in
another
there
was
no
fire
and
the
black
grate
showed
cold
dead
ashes
as
the
cart
man
turned
to
go
out
after
he
had
brought
in
the
boxes
there
was
a
rustling
scampering
sound
that
seemed
to
come
from
inside
the
walls
of
the
house
oh
what
that
cried
the
girls
it
only
the
rats
said
the
cart
man
and
he
went
away
and
shut
the
door
and
the
sudden
draught
of
it
blew
out
the
candle
oh
dear
said
phyllis
i
wish
we
had
come
and
she
knocked
a
chair
over
only
the
rats
said
peter
in
the
dark
chapter
ii
peter
what
fun
said
mother
in
the
dark
feeling
for
the
matches
on
the
table
how
frightened
the
poor
mice
were
i
do
believe
they
were
rats
at
she
struck
a
match
and
relighted
the
candle
and
everyone
looked
at
each
other
by
its
winky
blinky
light
well
she
said
you
often
wanted
something
to
happen
and
now
it
has
this
is
quite
an
adventure
is
it
i
told
viney
to
get
us
some
bread
and
butter
and
meat
and
things
and
to
have
supper
ready
i
suppose
she
laid
it
in
the
so
let
go
and
the
opened
out
of
the
kitchen
it
looked
much
darker
than
the
kitchen
when
they
went
in
with
the
one
candle
because
the
kitchen
was
whitewashed
but
the
was
dark
wood
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
across
the
ceiling
there
were
heavy
black
beams
there
was
a
muddled
maze
of
dusty
furniture
the
furniture
from
the
old
home
where
they
had
lived
all
their
lives
it
seemed
a
very
long
time
ago
and
a
very
long
way
off
there
was
the
table
certainly
and
there
were
chairs
but
there
was
no
supper
let
look
in
the
other
rooms
said
mother
and
they
looked
and
in
each
room
was
the
same
kind
of
blundering
of
furniture
and
and
crockery
and
all
sorts
of
odd
things
on
the
floor
but
there
was
nothing
to
eat
even
in
the
pantry
there
were
only
a
rusty
and
a
broken
plate
with
whitening
mixed
in
it
what
a
horrid
old
woman
said
mother
she
just
walked
off
with
the
money
and
not
got
us
anything
to
eat
at
then
sha
we
have
any
supper
at
all
asked
phyllis
dismayed
stepping
back
on
to
a
that
cracked
responsively
oh
yes
said
mother
only
it
mean
unpacking
one
of
those
big
cases
that
we
put
in
the
cellar
phil
do
mind
where
you
walking
to
there
a
dear
peter
hold
the
the
cellar
door
opened
out
of
the
kitchen
there
were
five
wooden
steps
leading
down
it
was
a
proper
cellar
at
all
the
children
thought
because
its
ceiling
went
up
as
high
as
the
kitchen
a
hung
under
its
ceiling
there
was
wood
in
it
and
coal
also
the
big
cases
peter
held
the
candle
all
on
one
side
while
mother
tried
to
open
the
great
it
was
very
securely
nailed
down
where
the
hammer
asked
peter
that
just
it
said
mother
i
afraid
it
inside
the
box
but
there
a
and
there
the
kitchen
and
with
these
she
tried
to
get
the
case
open
let
me
do
it
said
peter
thinking
he
could
do
it
better
himself
everyone
thinks
this
when
he
sees
another
person
stirring
a
fire
or
opening
a
box
or
untying
a
knot
in
a
bit
of
string
you
hurt
your
hands
mammy
said
roberta
let
i
wish
father
was
here
said
phyllis
he
get
it
open
in
two
shakes
what
are
you
kicking
me
for
bobbie
i
was
said
roberta
just
then
the
first
of
the
long
nails
in
the
began
to
come
out
with
a
scrunch
then
a
lath
was
raised
and
then
another
till
all
four
stood
up
with
the
long
nails
in
them
shining
fiercely
like
iron
teeth
in
the
hooray
said
mother
here
are
some
candles
the
very
first
thing
you
girls
go
and
light
them
you
find
some
saucers
and
things
just
drop
a
little
in
the
saucer
and
stick
the
candle
upright
in
how
many
shall
we
light
as
many
as
ever
you
like
said
mother
gaily
the
great
thing
is
to
be
cheerful
nobody
can
be
cheerful
in
the
dark
except
owls
and
so
the
girls
lighted
candles
the
head
of
the
first
match
flew
off
and
stuck
to
phyllis
finger
but
as
roberta
said
it
was
only
a
little
burn
and
she
might
have
had
to
be
a
roman
martyr
and
be
burned
whole
if
she
had
happened
to
live
in
the
days
when
those
things
were
fashionable
then
when
the
was
lighted
by
fourteen
candles
roberta
fetched
coal
and
wood
and
lighted
a
fire
it
very
cold
for
may
she
said
feeling
what
a
thing
it
was
to
say
the
and
the
made
the
look
very
different
for
now
you
could
see
that
the
dark
walls
were
of
wood
carved
here
and
there
into
little
wreaths
and
loops
the
girls
hastily
the
room
which
meant
putting
the
chairs
against
the
wall
and
piling
all
the
odds
and
ends
into
a
corner
and
partly
hiding
them
with
the
big
leather
that
father
used
to
sit
in
after
dinner
bravo
cried
mother
coming
in
with
a
tray
full
of
things
this
is
something
like
i
just
get
a
tablecloth
and
then
the
tablecloth
was
in
a
box
with
a
proper
lock
that
was
opened
with
a
key
and
not
with
a
shovel
and
when
the
cloth
was
spread
on
the
table
a
real
feast
was
laid
out
on
it
everyone
was
very
very
tired
but
everyone
cheered
up
at
the
sight
of
the
funny
and
delightful
supper
there
were
biscuits
the
marie
and
the
plain
kind
sardines
preserved
ginger
cooking
raisins
and
candied
peel
and
marmalade
what
a
good
thing
aunt
emma
packed
up
all
the
odds
and
ends
out
of
the
store
cupboard
said
mother
now
phil
do
put
the
marmalade
spoon
in
among
the
no
i
wo
mother
said
phyllis
and
put
it
down
among
the
marie
biscuits
let
drink
aunt
emma
health
said
roberta
suddenly
what
should
we
have
done
if
she
had
packed
up
these
things
here
to
aunt
emma
and
the
toast
was
drunk
in
ginger
wine
and
water
out
of
because
the
glasses
could
be
found
they
all
felt
that
they
had
been
a
little
hard
on
aunt
emma
she
a
nice
cuddly
person
like
mother
but
after
all
it
was
she
who
had
thought
of
packing
up
the
odds
and
ends
of
things
to
eat
it
was
aunt
emma
too
who
had
aired
all
the
sheets
ready
and
the
men
who
had
moved
the
furniture
had
put
the
bedsteads
together
so
the
beds
were
soon
made
good
night
chickies
said
mother
i
sure
there
are
any
rats
but
i
leave
my
door
open
and
then
if
a
mouse
comes
you
need
only
scream
and
i
come
and
tell
it
exactly
what
i
think
of
then
she
went
to
her
own
room
roberta
woke
to
hear
the
little
travelling
clock
chime
two
it
sounded
like
a
church
clock
ever
so
far
away
she
always
thought
and
she
heard
too
mother
still
moving
about
in
her
room
next
morning
roberta
woke
phyllis
by
pulling
her
hair
gently
but
quite
enough
for
her
purpose
wassermarrer
asked
phyllis
still
almost
wholly
asleep
wake
up
wake
up
said
roberta
we
in
the
new
house
do
you
remember
no
servants
or
anything
let
get
up
and
begin
to
be
useful
we
just
creep
down
and
have
everything
beautiful
before
mother
gets
up
i
woke
peter
he
be
dressed
as
soon
as
we
so
they
dressed
quietly
and
quickly
of
course
there
was
no
water
in
their
room
so
when
they
got
down
they
washed
as
much
as
they
thought
was
necessary
under
the
spout
of
the
pump
in
the
yard
one
pumped
and
the
other
washed
it
was
splashy
but
interesting
it
much
more
fun
than
basin
washing
said
roberta
how
sparkly
the
weeds
are
between
the
stones
and
the
moss
on
the
roof
oh
and
the
flowers
the
roof
of
the
back
kitchen
sloped
down
quite
low
it
was
made
of
thatch
and
it
had
moss
on
it
and
and
stonecrop
and
wallflowers
and
even
a
clump
of
purple
at
the
far
corner
this
is
far
far
far
and
away
prettier
than
edgecombe
villa
said
phyllis
i
wonder
what
the
garden
we
must
think
of
the
garden
yet
said
roberta
with
earnest
energy
let
go
in
and
begin
to
they
lighted
the
fire
and
put
the
kettle
on
and
they
arranged
the
crockery
for
breakfast
they
could
not
find
all
the
right
things
but
a
glass
made
an
excellent
and
a
newish
seemed
as
if
it
would
do
to
put
bread
on
if
they
had
any
when
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
more
that
they
could
do
they
went
out
again
into
the
fresh
bright
morning
we
go
into
the
garden
now
said
peter
but
somehow
they
find
the
garden
they
went
round
the
house
and
round
the
house
the
yard
occupied
the
back
and
across
it
were
stables
and
outbuildings
on
the
other
three
sides
the
house
stood
simply
in
a
field
without
a
yard
of
garden
to
divide
it
from
the
short
smooth
turf
and
yet
they
had
certainly
seen
the
garden
wall
the
night
before
it
was
a
hilly
country
down
below
they
could
see
the
line
of
the
railway
and
the
black
yawning
mouth
of
a
tunnel
the
station
was
out
of
sight
there
was
a
great
bridge
with
tall
arches
running
across
one
end
of
the
valley
never
mind
the
garden
said
peter
let
go
down
and
look
at
the
railway
there
might
be
trains
we
can
see
them
from
here
said
roberta
slowly
let
sit
down
a
so
they
all
sat
down
on
a
great
flat
grey
stone
that
had
pushed
itself
up
out
of
the
grass
it
was
one
of
many
that
lay
about
on
the
hillside
and
when
mother
came
out
to
look
for
them
at
eight
she
found
them
deeply
asleep
in
a
contented
bunch
they
had
made
an
excellent
fire
and
had
set
the
kettle
on
it
at
about
five
so
that
by
eight
the
fire
had
been
out
for
some
time
the
water
had
all
boiled
away
and
the
bottom
was
burned
out
of
the
kettle
also
they
had
not
thought
of
washing
the
crockery
before
they
set
the
table
but
it
does
matter
the
cups
and
saucers
i
mean
said
mother
because
i
found
another
room
i
quite
forgotten
there
was
one
and
it
magic
and
i
boiled
the
water
for
tea
in
a
the
forgotten
room
opened
out
of
the
kitchen
in
the
agitation
and
half
darkness
the
night
before
its
door
had
been
mistaken
for
a
cupboard
it
was
a
little
square
room
and
on
its
table
all
nicely
set
out
was
a
joint
of
cold
roast
beef
with
bread
butter
cheese
and
a
pie
pie
for
breakfast
cried
peter
how
perfectly
ripping
it
is
said
mother
it
only
apple
well
this
is
the
supper
we
ought
to
have
had
last
night
and
there
was
a
note
from
viney
her
has
broken
his
arm
and
she
had
to
get
home
early
she
coming
this
morning
at
that
was
a
wonderful
breakfast
it
is
unusual
to
begin
the
day
with
cold
apple
pie
but
the
children
all
said
they
would
rather
have
it
than
meat
you
see
it
more
like
dinner
than
breakfast
to
us
said
peter
passing
his
plate
for
more
because
we
were
up
so
the
day
passed
in
helping
mother
to
unpack
and
arrange
things
six
small
legs
quite
ached
with
running
about
while
their
owners
carried
clothes
and
crockery
and
all
sorts
of
things
to
their
proper
places
it
was
not
till
quite
late
in
the
afternoon
that
mother
said
there
that
do
for
i
lie
down
for
an
hour
so
as
to
be
as
fresh
as
a
lark
by
then
they
all
looked
at
each
other
each
of
the
three
expressive
countenances
expressed
the
same
thought
that
thought
was
double
and
consisted
like
the
bits
of
information
in
the
child
guide
to
knowledge
of
a
question
and
an
answer
q
where
shall
we
go
a
to
the
railway
so
to
the
railway
they
went
and
as
soon
as
they
started
for
the
railway
they
saw
where
the
garden
had
hidden
itself
it
was
right
behind
the
stables
and
it
had
a
high
wall
all
round
oh
never
mind
about
the
garden
now
cried
peter
mother
told
me
this
morning
where
it
was
it
keep
till
let
get
to
the
the
way
to
the
railway
was
all
down
hill
over
smooth
short
turf
with
here
and
there
furze
bushes
and
grey
and
yellow
rocks
sticking
out
like
candied
peel
from
the
top
of
a
cake
the
way
ended
in
a
steep
run
and
a
wooden
fence
and
there
was
the
railway
with
the
shining
metals
and
the
telegraph
wires
and
posts
and
signals
they
all
climbed
on
to
the
top
of
the
fence
and
then
suddenly
there
was
a
rumbling
sound
that
made
them
look
along
the
line
to
the
right
where
the
dark
mouth
of
a
tunnel
opened
itself
in
the
face
of
a
rocky
cliff
next
moment
a
train
had
rushed
out
of
the
tunnel
with
a
shriek
and
a
snort
and
had
slid
noisily
past
them
they
felt
the
rush
of
its
passing
and
the
pebbles
on
the
line
jumped
and
rattled
under
it
as
it
went
by
oh
said
roberta
drawing
a
long
breath
it
was
like
a
great
dragon
tearing
by
did
you
feel
it
fan
us
with
its
hot
wings
i
suppose
a
dragon
lair
might
look
very
like
that
tunnel
from
the
outside
said
phyllis
but
peter
said
i
never
thought
we
should
ever
get
as
near
to
a
train
as
this
it
the
most
ripping
sport
better
than
is
it
said
roberta
i
am
tired
of
calling
roberta
by
her
name
i
do
see
why
i
should
no
one
else
did
everyone
else
called
her
bobbie
and
i
do
see
why
i
should
i
do
know
it
different
said
peter
it
seems
so
odd
to
see
all
of
a
train
it
awfully
tall
is
it
we
always
seen
them
cut
in
half
by
platforms
said
phyllis
i
wonder
if
that
train
was
going
to
london
bobbie
said
where
father
let
go
down
to
the
station
and
find
out
said
peter
so
they
went
they
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
line
and
heard
the
telegraph
wires
humming
over
their
heads
when
you
are
in
the
train
it
seems
such
a
little
way
between
post
and
post
and
one
after
another
the
posts
seem
to
catch
up
the
wires
almost
more
quickly
than
you
can
count
them
but
when
you
have
to
walk
the
posts
seem
few
and
far
between
but
the
children
got
to
the
station
at
last
never
before
had
any
of
them
been
at
a
station
except
for
the
purpose
of
catching
trains
or
perhaps
waiting
for
them
and
always
with
in
attendance
who
were
not
themselves
interested
in
stations
except
as
places
from
which
they
wished
to
get
away
never
before
had
they
passed
close
enough
to
a
to
be
able
to
notice
the
wires
and
to
hear
the
mysterious
ping
followed
by
the
strong
firm
clicking
of
machinery
the
very
sleepers
on
which
the
rails
lay
were
a
delightful
path
to
travel
by
just
far
enough
apart
to
serve
as
the
in
a
game
of
foaming
torrents
hastily
organised
by
bobbie
then
to
arrive
at
the
station
not
through
the
booking
office
but
in
a
freebooting
sort
of
way
by
the
sloping
end
of
the
platform
this
in
itself
was
joy
joy
too
it
was
to
peep
into
the
porters
room
where
the
lamps
are
and
the
railway
almanac
on
the
wall
and
one
porter
half
asleep
behind
a
paper
there
were
a
great
many
crossing
lines
at
the
station
some
of
them
just
ran
into
a
yard
and
stopped
short
as
though
they
were
tired
of
business
and
meant
to
retire
for
good
trucks
stood
on
the
rails
here
and
on
one
side
was
a
great
heap
of
coal
not
a
loose
heap
such
as
you
see
in
your
coal
cellar
but
a
sort
of
solid
building
of
coals
with
large
square
blocks
of
coal
outside
used
just
as
though
they
were
bricks
and
built
up
till
the
heap
looked
like
the
picture
of
the
cities
of
the
plain
in
stories
for
infants
there
was
a
line
of
whitewash
near
the
top
of
the
coaly
wall
when
presently
the
porter
lounged
out
of
his
room
at
the
tingling
thrill
of
a
gong
over
the
station
door
peter
said
how
do
you
do
in
his
best
manner
and
hastened
to
ask
what
the
white
mark
was
on
the
coal
for
to
mark
how
much
coal
there
be
said
the
porter
so
as
we
know
if
anyone
nicks
it
so
do
you
go
off
with
none
in
your
pockets
young
gentleman
this
seemed
at
the
time
but
a
merry
jest
and
peter
felt
at
once
that
the
porter
was
a
friendly
sort
with
no
nonsense
about
him
but
later
the
words
came
back
to
peter
with
a
new
meaning
have
you
ever
gone
into
a
farmhouse
kitchen
on
a
baking
day
and
seen
the
great
crock
of
dough
set
by
the
fire
to
rise
if
you
have
and
if
you
were
at
that
time
still
young
enough
to
be
interested
in
everything
you
saw
you
will
remember
that
you
found
yourself
quite
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
to
poke
your
finger
into
the
soft
round
of
dough
that
curved
inside
the
pan
like
a
giant
mushroom
and
you
will
remember
that
your
finger
made
a
dent
in
the
dough
and
that
slowly
but
quite
surely
the
dent
disappeared
and
the
dough
looked
quite
the
same
as
it
did
before
you
touched
it
unless
of
course
your
hand
was
extra
dirty
in
which
case
naturally
there
would
be
a
little
black
mark
well
it
was
just
like
that
with
the
sorrow
the
children
had
felt
at
father
going
away
and
at
mother
being
so
unhappy
it
made
a
deep
impression
but
the
impression
did
not
last
long
they
soon
got
used
to
being
without
father
though
they
did
not
forget
him
and
they
got
used
to
not
going
to
school
and
to
seeing
very
little
of
mother
who
was
now
almost
all
day
shut
up
in
her
upstairs
room
writing
writing
writing
she
used
to
come
down
at
and
read
aloud
the
stories
she
had
written
they
were
lovely
stories
the
rocks
and
hills
and
valleys
and
trees
the
canal
and
above
all
the
railway
were
so
new
and
so
perfectly
pleasing
that
the
remembrance
of
the
old
life
in
the
villa
grew
to
seem
almost
like
a
dream
mother
had
told
them
more
than
once
that
they
were
poor
now
but
this
did
not
seem
to
be
anything
but
a
way
of
speaking
people
even
mothers
often
make
remarks
that
do
seem
to
mean
anything
in
particular
just
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
seemingly
there
was
always
enough
to
eat
and
they
wore
the
same
kind
of
nice
clothes
they
had
always
worn
but
in
june
came
three
wet
days
the
rain
came
down
straight
as
lances
and
it
was
very
very
cold
nobody
could
go
out
and
everybody
shivered
they
all
went
up
to
the
door
of
mother
room
and
knocked
well
what
is
it
asked
mother
from
inside
mother
said
bobbie
may
i
light
a
fire
i
do
know
and
mother
said
no
my
we
must
have
fires
in
june
coal
is
so
dear
if
you
cold
go
and
have
a
good
romp
in
the
attic
that
warm
but
mother
it
only
takes
such
a
very
little
coal
to
make
a
it
more
than
we
can
afford
said
mother
cheerfully
now
run
away
there
darlings
i
madly
busy
mother
always
busy
now
said
phyllis
in
a
whisper
to
peter
peter
did
not
answer
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
thinking
thought
however
could
not
long
keep
itself
from
the
suitable
furnishing
of
a
bandit
lair
in
the
attic
peter
was
the
bandit
of
course
bobbie
was
his
lieutenant
his
band
of
trusty
robbers
and
in
due
course
the
parent
of
phyllis
who
was
the
captured
maiden
for
whom
a
magnificent
ransom
in
was
unhesitatingly
paid
they
all
went
down
to
tea
flushed
and
joyous
as
any
mountain
brigands
but
when
phyllis
was
going
to
add
jam
to
her
bread
and
butter
mother
said
jam
or
butter
dear
not
jam
and
butter
we
ca
afford
that
sort
of
reckless
luxury
phyllis
finished
the
slice
of
bread
and
butter
in
silence
and
followed
it
up
by
bread
and
jam
peter
mingled
thought
and
weak
tea
after
tea
they
went
back
to
the
attic
and
he
said
to
his
sisters
i
have
an
what
that
they
asked
politely
i
sha
tell
you
was
peter
unexpected
rejoinder
oh
very
well
said
bobbie
and
phil
said
do
girls
said
peter
are
always
so
hasty
i
should
like
to
know
what
boys
are
said
bobbie
with
fine
disdain
i
do
want
to
know
about
your
silly
you
know
some
day
said
peter
keeping
his
own
temper
by
what
looked
exactly
like
a
miracle
if
you
had
been
so
keen
on
a
row
i
might
have
told
you
about
it
being
only
that
made
me
not
tell
you
my
idea
but
now
i
sha
tell
you
anything
at
all
about
it
so
there
and
it
was
indeed
some
time
before
he
could
be
induced
to
say
anything
and
when
he
did
it
was
much
he
said
the
only
reason
why
i
wo
tell
you
my
idea
that
i
going
to
do
is
because
it
may
be
wrong
and
i
do
want
to
drag
you
into
do
you
do
it
if
it
wrong
peter
said
bobbie
let
me
do
but
phyllis
said
should
like
to
do
wrong
if
you
going
to
no
said
peter
rather
touched
by
this
devotion
it
a
forlorn
hope
and
i
going
to
lead
it
all
i
ask
is
that
if
mother
asks
where
i
am
you
wo
we
have
got
anything
to
blab
said
bobbie
indignantly
oh
yes
you
have
said
peter
dropping
through
his
fingers
i
trusted
you
to
the
death
you
know
i
going
to
do
a
lone
adventure
and
some
people
might
think
it
wrong
i
do
and
if
mother
asks
where
i
am
say
i
playing
at
what
sort
of
mines
you
just
say
you
might
tell
us
well
then
but
do
you
let
the
word
pass
your
lips
on
pain
of
you
need
threaten
said
bobbie
and
i
do
think
you
might
let
us
if
i
find
a
you
shall
help
cart
the
coal
peter
condescended
to
promise
keep
your
secret
if
you
like
said
phyllis
keep
it
if
you
can
said
bobbie
i
keep
it
right
enough
said
peter
between
tea
and
supper
there
is
an
interval
even
in
the
most
greedily
regulated
families
at
this
time
mother
was
usually
writing
and
viney
had
gone
home
two
nights
after
the
dawning
of
peter
idea
he
beckoned
the
girls
mysteriously
at
the
twilight
hour
come
hither
with
me
he
said
and
bring
the
roman
the
roman
chariot
was
a
very
old
perambulator
that
had
spent
years
of
retirement
in
the
loft
over
the
the
children
had
oiled
its
works
till
it
glided
noiseless
as
a
pneumatic
bicycle
and
answered
to
the
helm
as
it
had
probably
done
in
its
best
days
follow
your
dauntless
leader
said
peter
and
led
the
way
down
the
hill
towards
the
station
just
above
the
station
many
rocks
have
pushed
their
heads
out
through
the
turf
as
though
they
like
the
children
were
interested
in
the
railway
in
a
little
hollow
between
three
rocks
lay
a
heap
of
dried
brambles
and
heather
peter
halted
turned
over
the
brushwood
with
a
boot
and
said
here
the
first
coal
from
the
peter
mine
we
take
it
home
in
the
chariot
punctuality
and
despatch
all
orders
carefully
attended
to
any
shaped
lump
cut
to
suit
regular
the
chariot
was
packed
full
of
coal
and
when
it
was
packed
it
had
to
be
unpacked
again
because
it
was
so
heavy
that
it
could
be
got
up
the
hill
by
the
three
children
not
even
when
peter
harnessed
himself
to
the
handle
with
his
braces
and
firmly
grasping
his
waistband
in
one
hand
pulled
while
the
girls
pushed
behind
three
journeys
had
to
be
made
before
the
coal
from
peter
mine
was
added
to
the
heap
of
mother
coal
in
the
cellar
afterwards
peter
went
out
alone
and
came
back
very
black
and
mysterious
i
been
to
my
he
said
evening
we
bring
home
the
black
diamonds
in
the
it
was
a
week
later
that
viney
remarked
to
mother
how
well
this
last
lot
of
coal
was
holding
out
the
children
hugged
themselves
and
each
other
in
complicated
wriggles
of
silent
laughter
as
they
listened
on
the
stairs
they
had
all
forgotten
by
now
that
there
had
ever
been
any
doubt
in
peter
mind
as
to
whether
was
wrong
but
there
came
a
dreadful
night
when
the
station
master
put
on
a
pair
of
old
sand
shoes
that
he
had
worn
at
the
seaside
in
his
summer
holiday
and
crept
out
very
quietly
to
the
yard
where
the
sodom
and
gomorrah
heap
of
coal
was
with
the
whitewashed
line
round
it
he
crept
out
there
and
he
waited
like
a
cat
by
a
mousehole
on
the
top
of
the
heap
something
small
and
dark
was
scrabbling
and
rattling
furtively
among
the
coal
the
station
master
concealed
himself
in
the
shadow
of
a
that
had
a
little
tin
chimney
and
was
labelled
and
return
at
once
to
white
heather
sidings
and
in
this
concealment
he
lurked
till
the
small
thing
on
the
top
of
the
heap
ceased
to
scrabble
and
rattle
came
to
the
edge
of
the
heap
cautiously
let
itself
down
and
lifted
something
after
it
then
the
arm
of
the
station
master
was
raised
the
hand
of
the
station
master
fell
on
a
collar
and
there
was
peter
firmly
held
by
the
jacket
with
an
old
carpenter
bag
full
of
coal
in
his
trembling
clutch
so
i
caught
you
at
last
have
i
you
young
thief
said
the
station
master
i
not
a
thief
said
peter
as
firmly
as
he
could
i
a
tell
that
to
the
marines
said
the
station
master
it
would
be
just
as
true
whoever
i
told
it
to
said
peter
you
right
there
said
the
man
who
held
him
stow
your
jaw
you
young
rip
and
come
along
to
the
oh
no
cried
in
the
darkness
an
agonised
voice
that
was
not
peter
not
the
police
station
said
another
voice
from
the
darkness
not
yet
said
the
station
master
the
railway
station
first
why
it
a
regular
gang
any
more
of
you
only
us
said
bobbie
and
phyllis
coming
out
of
the
shadow
of
another
truck
labelled
staveley
colliery
and
bearing
on
it
the
legend
in
white
chalk
in
no
road
what
do
you
mean
by
spying
on
a
fellow
like
this
said
peter
angrily
time
someone
did
spy
on
you
think
said
the
station
master
come
along
to
the
oh
do
said
bobbie
ca
you
decide
now
what
you
do
to
us
it
our
fault
just
as
much
as
peter
we
helped
to
carry
the
coal
away
and
we
knew
where
he
got
no
you
did
said
peter
yes
we
did
said
bobbie
we
knew
all
the
time
we
only
pretended
we
did
just
to
humour
peter
cup
was
full
he
had
mined
for
coal
he
had
struck
coal
he
had
been
caught
and
now
he
learned
that
his
sisters
had
him
do
hold
me
he
said
i
wo
run
the
station
master
loosed
peter
collar
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
them
by
its
flickering
light
why
said
he
you
the
children
from
the
three
chimneys
up
yonder
so
nicely
dressed
too
tell
me
now
what
made
you
do
such
a
thing
have
you
ever
been
to
church
or
learned
your
catechism
or
anything
not
to
know
it
wicked
to
steal
he
spoke
much
more
gently
now
and
peter
said
i
did
think
it
was
stealing
i
was
almost
sure
it
was
i
thought
if
i
took
it
from
the
outside
part
of
the
heap
perhaps
it
would
be
but
in
the
middle
i
thought
i
could
fairly
count
it
only
mining
take
thousands
of
years
for
you
to
burn
up
all
that
coal
and
get
to
the
middle
not
quite
but
did
you
do
it
for
a
lark
or
what
not
much
lark
carting
that
beastly
heavy
stuff
up
the
hill
said
peter
indignantly
then
why
did
you
the
station
master
voice
was
so
much
kinder
now
that
peter
replied
you
know
that
wet
day
well
mother
said
we
were
too
poor
to
have
a
fire
we
always
had
fires
when
it
was
cold
at
our
other
house
and
do
interrupted
bobbie
in
a
whisper
well
said
the
station
master
rubbing
his
chin
thoughtfully
tell
you
what
i
do
i
look
over
it
this
once
but
you
remember
young
gentleman
stealing
is
stealing
and
what
mine
is
yours
whether
you
call
it
mining
or
whether
you
do
run
along
do
you
mean
you
are
going
to
do
anything
to
us
well
you
are
a
brick
said
peter
with
enthusiasm
you
a
dear
said
bobbie
you
a
darling
said
phyllis
that
all
right
said
the
station
master
and
on
this
they
parted
do
speak
to
me
said
peter
as
the
three
went
up
the
hill
spies
and
traitors
that
what
you
but
the
girls
were
too
glad
to
have
peter
between
them
safe
and
free
and
on
the
way
to
three
chimneys
and
not
to
the
police
station
to
mind
much
what
he
said
we
did
say
it
was
us
as
much
as
you
said
bobbie
gently
well
and
it
it
would
have
come
to
the
same
thing
in
courts
with
judges
said
phyllis
do
be
snarky
peter
it
is
our
fault
your
secrets
are
so
jolly
easy
to
find
she
took
his
arm
and
he
let
her
there
an
awful
lot
of
coal
in
the
cellar
anyhow
he
went
on
oh
do
said
bobbie
i
do
think
we
ought
to
be
glad
about
i
do
know
said
peter
plucking
up
a
spirit
i
not
at
all
sure
even
now
that
mining
is
a
but
the
girls
were
quite
sure
and
they
were
also
quite
sure
that
he
was
quite
sure
however
little
he
cared
to
own
it
chapter
iii
the
old
gentleman
after
the
adventure
of
peter
it
seemed
well
to
the
children
to
keep
away
from
the
station
but
they
did
not
they
could
not
keep
away
from
the
railway
they
had
lived
all
their
lives
in
a
street
where
cabs
and
omnibuses
rumbled
by
at
all
hours
and
the
carts
of
butchers
and
bakers
and
candlestick
makers
i
never
saw
a
cart
did
you
might
occur
at
any
moment
here
in
the
deep
silence
of
the
sleeping
country
the
only
things
that
went
by
were
the
trains
they
seemed
to
be
all
that
was
left
to
link
the
children
to
the
old
life
that
had
once
been
theirs
straight
down
the
hill
in
front
of
three
chimneys
the
daily
passage
of
their
six
feet
began
to
mark
a
path
across
the
crisp
short
turf
they
began
to
know
the
hours
when
certain
trains
passed
and
they
gave
names
to
them
the
up
was
called
the
green
dragon
the
down
was
the
worm
of
wantley
the
midnight
town
express
whose
shrieking
rush
they
sometimes
woke
from
their
dreams
to
hear
was
the
fearsome
peter
got
up
once
in
chill
starshine
and
peeping
at
it
through
his
curtains
named
it
on
the
spot
it
was
by
the
green
dragon
that
the
old
gentleman
travelled
he
was
a
very
old
gentleman
and
he
looked
as
if
he
were
nice
too
which
is
not
at
all
the
same
thing
he
had
a
face
and
white
hair
and
he
wore
rather
collars
and
a
that
was
exactly
the
same
kind
as
other
people
of
course
the
children
did
see
all
this
at
first
in
fact
the
first
thing
they
noticed
about
the
old
gentleman
was
his
hand
it
was
one
morning
as
they
sat
on
the
fence
waiting
for
the
green
dragon
which
was
three
and
a
quarter
minutes
late
by
peter
waterbury
watch
that
he
had
had
given
him
on
his
last
birthday
the
green
dragon
going
where
father
is
said
phyllis
if
it
were
a
really
real
dragon
we
could
stop
it
and
ask
it
to
take
our
love
to
dragons
do
carry
people
love
said
peter
they
be
above
yes
they
do
if
you
tame
them
thoroughly
first
they
fetch
and
carry
like
pet
spaniels
said
phyllis
and
feed
out
of
your
hand
i
wonder
why
father
never
writes
to
mother
says
he
been
too
busy
said
bobbie
but
he
write
soon
she
i
say
phyllis
suggested
let
all
wave
to
the
green
dragon
as
it
goes
by
if
it
a
magic
dragon
it
understand
and
take
our
loves
to
father
and
if
it
is
three
waves
are
much
we
shall
never
miss
so
when
the
green
dragon
tore
shrieking
out
of
the
mouth
of
its
dark
lair
which
was
the
tunnel
all
three
children
stood
on
the
railing
and
waved
their
without
stopping
to
think
whether
they
were
clean
handkerchiefs
or
the
reverse
they
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
very
much
the
reverse
and
out
of
a
carriage
a
hand
waved
back
a
quite
clean
hand
it
held
a
newspaper
it
was
the
old
gentleman
hand
after
this
it
became
the
custom
for
waves
to
be
exchanged
between
the
children
and
the
and
the
children
especially
the
girls
liked
to
think
that
perhaps
the
old
gentleman
knew
father
and
would
meet
him
business
wherever
that
shady
retreat
might
be
and
tell
him
how
his
three
children
stood
on
a
rail
far
away
in
the
green
country
and
waved
their
love
to
him
every
morning
wet
or
fine
for
they
were
now
able
to
go
out
in
all
sorts
of
weather
such
as
they
would
never
have
been
allowed
to
go
out
in
when
they
lived
in
their
villa
house
this
was
aunt
emma
doing
and
the
children
felt
more
and
more
that
they
had
not
been
quite
fair
to
this
unattractive
aunt
when
they
found
how
useful
were
the
long
gaiters
and
waterproof
coats
that
they
had
laughed
at
her
for
buying
for
them
mother
all
this
time
was
very
busy
with
her
writing
she
used
to
send
off
a
good
many
long
blue
envelopes
with
stories
in
them
and
large
envelopes
of
different
sizes
and
colours
used
to
come
to
her
sometimes
she
would
sigh
when
she
opened
them
and
say
another
story
come
home
to
roost
oh
dear
oh
dear
and
then
the
children
would
be
very
sorry
but
sometimes
she
would
wave
the
envelope
in
the
air
and
say
hooray
hooray
here
a
sensible
editor
he
taken
my
story
and
this
is
the
proof
of
at
first
the
children
thought
proof
meant
the
letter
the
sensible
editor
had
written
but
they
presently
got
to
know
that
the
proof
was
long
slips
of
paper
with
the
story
printed
on
them
whenever
an
editor
was
sensible
there
were
buns
for
tea
one
day
peter
was
going
down
to
the
village
to
get
buns
to
celebrate
the
sensibleness
of
the
editor
of
the
children
globe
when
he
met
the
station
master
peter
felt
very
uncomfortable
for
he
had
now
had
time
to
think
over
the
affair
of
the
he
did
not
like
to
say
good
morning
to
the
station
master
as
you
usually
do
to
anyone
you
meet
on
a
lonely
road
because
he
had
a
hot
feeling
which
spread
even
to
his
ears
that
the
station
master
might
not
care
to
speak
to
a
person
who
had
stolen
coals
is
a
nasty
word
but
peter
felt
it
was
the
right
one
so
he
looked
down
and
said
nothing
it
was
the
station
master
who
said
good
morning
as
he
passed
by
and
peter
answered
good
then
he
thought
perhaps
he
does
know
who
i
am
by
daylight
or
he
would
be
so
and
he
did
not
like
the
feeling
which
thinking
this
gave
him
and
then
before
he
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
ran
after
the
station
master
who
stopped
when
he
heard
peter
hasty
boots
crunching
the
road
and
coming
up
with
him
very
breathless
and
with
his
ears
now
quite
he
said
i
do
want
you
to
be
polite
to
me
if
you
do
know
me
when
you
see
eh
said
the
station
master
i
thought
perhaps
you
did
know
it
was
me
that
took
the
coals
peter
went
on
when
you
said
morning
but
it
was
and
i
sorry
why
said
the
station
master
i
was
thinking
anything
at
all
about
the
precious
coals
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
where
were
you
off
to
in
such
a
hurry
i
going
to
buy
buns
for
tea
said
peter
i
thought
you
were
all
so
poor
said
the
station
master
so
we
are
said
peter
confidentially
but
we
always
have
three
pennyworth
of
halfpennies
for
tea
whenever
mother
sells
a
story
or
a
poem
or
oh
said
the
station
master
so
your
mother
writes
stories
does
she
the
beautifulest
you
ever
read
said
peter
you
ought
to
be
very
proud
to
have
such
a
clever
yes
said
peter
but
she
used
to
play
with
us
more
before
she
had
to
be
so
well
said
the
station
master
i
must
be
getting
along
you
give
us
a
look
in
at
the
station
whenever
you
feel
so
inclined
and
as
to
coals
it
a
word
that
well
oh
no
we
never
mention
it
eh
thank
you
said
peter
i
very
glad
it
all
straightened
out
between
and
he
went
on
across
the
canal
bridge
to
the
village
to
get
the
buns
feeling
more
comfortable
in
his
mind
than
he
had
felt
since
the
hand
of
the
station
master
had
fastened
on
his
collar
that
night
among
the
coals
next
day
when
they
had
sent
the
threefold
wave
of
greeting
to
father
by
the
green
dragon
and
the
old
gentleman
had
waved
back
as
usual
peter
proudly
led
the
way
to
the
station
but
ought
we
said
bobbie
after
the
coals
she
means
phyllis
explained
i
met
the
station
master
yesterday
said
peter
in
an
offhand
way
and
he
pretended
not
to
hear
what
phyllis
had
said
he
expresspecially
invited
us
to
go
down
any
time
we
after
the
coals
repeated
phyllis
stop
a
minute
my
bootlace
is
undone
it
always
is
undone
again
said
peter
and
the
station
master
was
more
of
a
gentleman
than
you
ever
be
phil
throwing
coal
at
a
head
like
phyllis
did
up
her
bootlace
and
went
on
in
silence
but
her
shoulders
shook
and
presently
a
fat
tear
fell
off
her
nose
and
splashed
on
the
metal
of
the
railway
line
bobbie
saw
it
why
what
the
matter
darling
she
said
stopping
short
and
putting
her
arm
round
the
heaving
shoulders
he
called
me
sobbed
phyllis
i
did
never
call
him
unladylike
not
even
when
he
tied
my
clorinda
to
the
firewood
bundle
and
burned
her
at
the
stake
for
a
peter
had
indeed
perpetrated
this
outrage
a
year
or
two
before
well
you
began
you
know
said
bobbie
honestly
about
coals
and
all
that
do
you
think
you
better
both
unsay
everything
since
the
wave
and
let
honour
be
satisfied
i
will
if
peter
will
said
phyllis
sniffling
all
right
said
peter
honour
is
satisfied
here
use
my
hankie
phil
for
goodness
sake
if
you
lost
yours
as
usual
i
wonder
what
you
do
with
you
had
my
last
one
said
phyllis
indignantly
to
tie
up
the
door
with
but
you
very
ungrateful
it
quite
right
what
it
says
in
the
poetry
book
about
sharper
than
a
serpent
it
is
to
have
a
toothless
child
but
it
means
ungrateful
when
it
says
toothless
miss
lowe
told
me
all
right
said
peter
impatiently
i
sorry
there
now
will
you
come
on
they
reached
the
station
and
spent
a
joyous
two
hours
with
the
porter
he
was
a
worthy
man
and
seemed
never
tired
of
answering
the
questions
that
begin
with
why
which
many
people
in
higher
ranks
of
life
often
seem
weary
of
he
told
them
many
things
that
they
had
not
known
before
as
for
instance
that
the
things
that
hook
carriages
together
are
called
couplings
and
that
the
pipes
like
great
serpents
that
hang
over
the
couplings
are
meant
to
stop
the
train
with
if
you
could
get
a
holt
of
one
o
them
when
the
train
is
going
and
pull
apart
said
he
she
stop
dead
off
with
a
who
she
said
phyllis
the
train
of
course
said
the
porter
after
that
the
train
was
never
again
to
the
children
and
you
know
the
thing
in
the
carriages
where
it
says
on
it
pounds
fine
for
improper
use
if
you
was
to
improperly
use
that
the
train
and
if
you
used
it
properly
said
roberta
it
stop
just
the
same
i
suppose
said
he
but
it
is
proper
use
unless
you
being
murdered
there
was
an
old
lady
once
someone
kidded
her
on
it
was
a
bell
and
she
used
it
improper
not
being
in
danger
of
her
life
though
hungry
and
when
the
train
stopped
and
the
guard
came
along
expecting
to
find
someone
weltering
in
their
last
moments
she
says
please
mister
i
take
a
glass
of
stout
and
a
bath
bun
she
says
and
the
train
was
seven
minutes
behind
her
time
as
it
what
did
the
guard
say
to
the
old
lady
dunno
replied
the
porter
but
i
lay
she
did
forget
it
in
a
hurry
whatever
it
in
such
delightful
conversation
the
time
went
by
all
too
quickly
the
station
master
came
out
once
or
twice
from
that
sacred
inner
temple
behind
the
place
where
the
hole
is
that
they
sell
you
tickets
through
and
was
most
jolly
with
them
all
just
as
if
coal
had
never
been
discovered
phyllis
whispered
to
her
sister
he
gave
them
each
an
orange
and
promised
to
take
them
up
into
the
one
of
these
days
when
he
was
so
busy
several
trains
went
through
the
station
and
peter
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
engines
have
numbers
on
them
like
cabs
yes
said
the
porter
i
knowed
a
young
gent
as
used
to
take
down
the
numbers
of
every
single
one
he
seed
in
a
green
with
silver
corners
it
was
owing
to
his
father
being
very
in
the
wholesale
peter
felt
that
he
could
take
down
numbers
too
even
if
he
was
not
the
son
of
a
wholesale
stationer
as
he
did
not
happen
to
have
a
green
leather
with
silver
corners
the
porter
gave
him
a
yellow
envelope
and
on
it
he
noted
and
felt
that
this
was
the
beginning
of
what
would
be
a
most
interesting
collection
that
night
at
tea
he
asked
mother
if
she
had
a
green
leather
with
silver
corners
she
had
not
but
when
she
heard
what
he
wanted
it
for
she
gave
him
a
little
black
one
it
has
a
few
pages
torn
out
said
she
but
it
will
hold
quite
a
lot
of
numbers
and
when
it
full
i
give
you
another
i
so
glad
you
like
the
railway
only
please
you
must
walk
on
the
not
if
we
face
the
way
the
train
coming
asked
peter
after
a
gloomy
pause
in
which
glances
of
despair
were
exchanged
no
really
not
said
mother
then
phyllis
said
mother
did
you
ever
walk
on
the
railway
lines
when
you
were
little
mother
was
an
honest
and
honourable
mother
so
she
had
to
say
well
then
said
phyllis
but
darlings
you
do
know
how
fond
i
am
of
you
what
should
i
do
if
you
got
hurt
are
you
fonder
of
us
than
granny
was
of
you
when
you
were
little
phyllis
asked
bobbie
made
signs
to
her
to
stop
but
phyllis
never
did
see
signs
no
matter
how
plain
they
might
be
mother
did
not
answer
for
a
minute
she
got
up
to
put
more
water
in
the
teapot
no
one
she
said
at
last
ever
loved
anyone
more
than
my
mother
loved
then
she
was
quiet
again
and
bobbie
kicked
phyllis
hard
under
the
table
because
bobbie
understood
a
little
bit
the
thoughts
that
were
making
mother
so
quiet
the
thoughts
of
the
time
when
mother
was
a
little
girl
and
was
all
the
world
to
her
mother
it
seems
so
easy
and
natural
to
run
to
mother
when
one
is
in
trouble
bobbie
understood
a
little
how
people
do
not
leave
off
running
to
their
mothers
when
they
are
in
trouble
even
when
they
are
grown
up
and
she
thought
she
knew
a
little
what
it
must
be
to
be
sad
and
have
no
mother
to
run
to
any
more
so
she
kicked
phyllis
who
said
what
are
you
kicking
me
like
that
for
bob
and
then
mother
laughed
a
little
and
sighed
and
said
very
well
then
only
let
me
be
sure
you
do
know
which
way
the
trains
come
and
do
walk
on
the
line
near
the
tunnel
or
near
trains
keep
to
the
left
like
carriages
said
peter
so
if
we
keep
to
the
right
we
bound
to
see
them
very
well
said
mother
and
i
dare
say
you
think
that
she
ought
not
to
have
said
it
but
she
remembered
about
when
she
was
a
little
girl
herself
and
she
did
say
it
and
neither
her
own
children
nor
you
nor
any
other
children
in
the
world
could
ever
understand
exactly
what
it
cost
her
to
do
it
only
some
few
of
you
like
bobbie
may
understand
a
very
little
bit
it
was
the
very
next
day
that
mother
had
to
stay
in
bed
because
her
head
ached
so
her
hands
were
burning
hot
and
she
would
not
eat
anything
and
her
throat
was
very
sore
if
i
was
you
mum
said
viney
i
should
take
and
send
for
the
doctor
there
a
lot
of
catchy
complaints
about
just
now
my
sister
eldest
she
took
a
chill
and
it
went
to
her
inside
two
years
ago
come
christmas
and
she
never
been
the
same
gell
mother
would
at
first
but
in
the
evening
she
felt
so
much
worse
that
peter
was
sent
to
the
house
in
the
village
that
had
three
laburnum
trees
by
the
gate
and
on
the
gate
a
brass
plate
with
forrest
on
it
forrest
came
at
once
he
talked
to
peter
on
the
way
back
he
seemed
a
most
charming
and
sensible
man
interested
in
railways
and
rabbits
and
really
important
things
when
he
had
seen
mother
he
said
it
was
influenza
now
lady
he
said
in
the
hall
to
bobbie
i
suppose
want
to
be
of
course
said
she
well
then
i
send
down
some
medicine
keep
up
a
good
fire
have
some
strong
beef
tea
made
ready
to
give
her
as
soon
as
the
fever
goes
down
she
can
have
grapes
now
and
beef
essence
and
and
milk
and
you
better
get
in
a
bottle
of
brandy
the
best
brandy
cheap
brandy
is
worse
than
she
asked
him
to
write
it
all
down
and
he
did
when
bobbie
showed
mother
the
list
he
had
written
mother
laughed
it
was
a
laugh
bobbie
decided
though
it
was
rather
odd
and
feeble
nonsense
said
mother
laying
in
bed
with
eyes
as
bright
as
beads
i
ca
afford
all
that
rubbish
tell
viney
to
boil
two
pounds
of
of
the
neck
for
your
dinners
and
i
can
have
some
of
the
broth
yes
i
should
like
some
more
water
now
love
and
will
you
get
a
basin
and
sponge
my
hands
roberta
obeyed
when
she
had
done
everything
she
could
to
make
mother
less
uncomfortable
she
went
down
to
the
others
her
cheeks
were
very
red
her
lips
set
tight
and
her
eyes
almost
as
bright
as
mother
she
told
them
what
the
doctor
had
said
and
what
mother
had
said
and
now
said
she
when
she
had
told
all
there
no
one
but
us
to
do
anything
and
we
got
to
do
it
i
got
the
shilling
for
the
we
can
do
without
the
beastly
mutton
said
peter
bread
and
butter
will
support
life
people
have
lived
on
less
on
desert
islands
many
a
of
course
said
his
sister
and
viney
was
sent
to
the
village
to
get
as
much
brandy
and
and
beef
tea
as
she
could
buy
for
a
shilling
but
even
if
we
never
have
anything
to
eat
at
all
said
phyllis
you
ca
get
all
those
other
things
with
our
dinner
no
said
bobbie
frowning
we
must
find
out
some
other
way
now
think
everybody
just
as
hard
as
ever
you
they
did
think
and
presently
they
talked
and
later
when
bobbie
had
gone
up
to
sit
with
mother
in
case
she
wanted
anything
the
other
two
were
very
busy
with
scissors
and
a
white
sheet
and
a
paint
brush
and
the
pot
of
brunswick
black
that
viney
used
for
grates
and
fenders
they
did
not
manage
to
do
what
they
wished
exactly
with
the
first
sheet
so
they
took
another
out
of
the
linen
cupboard
it
did
not
occur
to
them
that
they
were
spoiling
good
sheets
which
cost
good
money
they
only
knew
that
they
were
making
a
good
but
what
they
were
making
comes
later
bobbie
bed
had
been
moved
into
mother
room
and
several
times
in
the
night
she
got
up
to
mend
the
fire
and
to
give
her
mother
milk
and
mother
talked
to
herself
a
good
deal
but
it
did
not
seem
to
mean
anything
and
once
she
woke
up
suddenly
and
called
out
mamma
mamma
and
bobbie
knew
she
was
calling
for
granny
and
that
she
had
forgotten
that
it
was
no
use
calling
because
granny
was
dead
in
the
early
morning
bobbie
heard
her
name
and
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
mother
bedside
oh
ah
yes
i
think
i
was
asleep
said
mother
my
poor
little
duck
how
tired
you
be
i
do
hate
to
give
you
all
this
trouble
said
bobbie
ah
do
cry
sweet
mother
said
i
shall
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
and
bobbie
said
yes
and
tried
to
smile
when
you
are
used
to
ten
hours
of
solid
sleep
to
get
up
three
or
four
times
in
your
makes
you
feel
as
though
you
had
been
up
all
night
bobbie
felt
quite
stupid
and
her
eyes
were
sore
and
stiff
but
she
tidied
the
room
and
arranged
everything
neatly
before
the
doctor
came
this
was
at
eight
everything
going
on
all
right
little
nurse
he
said
at
the
front
door
did
you
get
the
brandy
i
got
the
brandy
said
bobbie
in
a
little
flat
i
did
see
the
grapes
or
the
beef
tea
though
said
he
no
said
bobbie
firmly
but
you
will
and
there
some
beef
stewing
in
the
oven
for
beef
who
told
you
to
do
that
he
asked
i
noticed
what
mother
did
when
phil
had
right
said
the
doctor
now
you
get
your
old
woman
to
sit
with
your
mother
and
then
you
eat
a
good
breakfast
and
go
straight
to
bed
and
sleep
till
we
ca
afford
to
have
the
he
was
really
quite
a
nice
doctor
when
the
came
out
of
the
tunnel
that
morning
the
old
gentleman
in
the
carriage
put
down
his
newspaper
and
got
ready
to
wave
his
hand
to
the
three
children
on
the
fence
but
this
morning
there
were
not
three
there
was
only
one
and
that
was
peter
peter
was
not
on
the
railings
either
as
usual
he
was
standing
in
front
of
them
in
an
attitude
like
that
of
a
showing
off
the
animals
in
a
menagerie
or
of
the
kind
clergyman
when
he
points
with
a
wand
at
the
from
palestine
when
there
is
a
and
he
is
explaining
it
peter
was
pointing
too
and
what
he
was
pointing
at
was
a
large
white
sheet
nailed
against
the
fence
on
the
sheet
there
were
thick
black
letters
more
than
a
foot
long
some
of
them
had
run
a
little
because
of
phyllis
having
put
the
brunswick
black
on
too
eagerly
but
the
words
were
quite
easy
to
read
and
this
what
the
old
gentleman
and
several
other
people
in
the
train
read
in
the
large
black
letters
on
the
white
sheet
look
out
at
the
station
a
good
many
people
did
look
out
at
the
station
and
were
disappointed
for
they
saw
nothing
unusual
the
old
gentleman
looked
out
too
and
at
first
he
too
saw
nothing
more
unusual
than
the
gravelled
platform
and
the
sunshine
and
the
wallflowers
and
in
the
station
borders
it
was
only
just
as
the
train
was
beginning
to
puff
and
pull
itself
together
to
start
again
that
he
saw
phyllis
she
was
quite
out
of
breath
with
running
oh
she
said
i
thought
i
missed
you
my
bootlaces
would
keep
coming
down
and
i
fell
over
them
twice
here
take
she
thrust
a
warm
dampish
letter
into
his
hand
as
the
train
moved
he
leaned
back
in
his
corner
and
opened
the
letter
this
is
what
he
read
dear
we
do
not
know
your
name
mother
is
ill
and
the
doctor
says
to
give
her
the
things
at
the
end
of
the
letter
but
she
says
she
ca
aford
it
and
to
get
mutton
for
us
and
she
will
have
the
broth
we
do
not
know
anybody
here
but
you
because
father
is
away
and
we
do
not
know
the
address
father
will
pay
you
or
if
he
has
lost
all
his
money
or
anything
peter
will
pay
you
when
he
is
a
man
we
promise
it
on
our
honer
for
all
the
things
mother
wants
sined
peter
will
you
give
the
parsel
to
the
station
master
because
of
us
not
knowing
what
train
you
come
down
by
say
it
is
for
peter
that
was
sorry
about
the
coals
and
he
will
know
all
right
roberta
phyllis
then
came
the
list
of
things
the
doctor
had
ordered
the
old
gentleman
read
it
through
once
and
his
eyebrows
went
up
he
read
it
twice
and
smiled
a
little
when
he
had
read
it
thrice
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
went
on
reading
the
times
at
about
six
that
evening
there
was
a
knock
at
the
back
door
the
three
children
rushed
to
open
it
and
there
stood
the
friendly
porter
who
had
told
them
so
many
interesting
things
about
railways
he
dumped
down
a
big
hamper
on
the
kitchen
flags
old
gent
he
said
he
asked
me
to
fetch
it
up
straight
thank
you
very
much
said
peter
and
then
as
the
porter
lingered
he
added
i
most
awfully
sorry
i
have
got
twopence
to
give
you
like
father
does
but
you
drop
it
if
you
please
said
the
porter
indignantly
i
thinking
about
no
tuppences
i
only
wanted
to
say
i
was
sorry
your
mamma
was
so
well
and
to
ask
how
she
finds
herself
this
evening
and
i
fetched
her
along
a
bit
of
sweetbrier
very
sweet
to
smell
it
is
twopence
indeed
said
he
and
produced
a
bunch
of
sweetbrier
from
his
hat
just
like
a
conjurer
as
phyllis
remarked
afterwards
thank
you
very
much
said
peter
and
i
beg
your
pardon
about
the
no
offence
said
the
porter
untruly
but
politely
and
went
then
the
children
undid
the
hamper
first
there
was
straw
and
then
there
were
fine
shavings
and
then
came
all
the
things
they
had
asked
for
and
plenty
of
them
and
then
a
good
many
things
they
had
not
asked
for
among
others
peaches
and
port
wine
and
two
chickens
a
cardboard
box
of
big
red
roses
with
long
stalks
and
a
tall
thin
green
bottle
of
lavender
water
and
three
smaller
fatter
bottles
of
there
was
a
letter
too
dear
roberta
and
phyllis
and
peter
it
said
here
are
the
things
you
want
your
mother
will
want
to
know
where
they
came
from
tell
her
they
were
sent
by
a
friend
who
heard
she
was
ill
when
she
is
well
again
you
must
tell
her
all
about
it
of
course
and
if
she
says
you
ought
not
to
have
asked
for
the
things
tell
her
that
i
say
you
were
quite
right
and
that
i
hope
she
will
forgive
me
for
taking
the
liberty
of
allowing
myself
a
very
great
the
letter
was
signed
something
that
the
children
could
read
i
think
we
were
right
said
phyllis
right
of
course
we
were
right
said
bobbie
all
the
same
said
peter
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
exactly
look
forward
to
telling
mother
the
whole
truth
about
we
not
to
do
it
till
she
well
said
bobbie
and
when
she
well
we
shall
be
so
happy
we
sha
mind
a
little
fuss
like
that
oh
just
look
at
the
roses
i
must
take
them
up
to
and
the
sweetbrier
said
phyllis
sniffing
it
loudly
do
forget
the
as
if
i
should
said
roberta
mother
told
me
the
other
day
there
was
a
thick
hedge
of
it
at
her
mother
house
when
she
was
a
little
chapter
iv
the
what
was
left
of
the
second
sheet
and
the
brunswick
black
came
in
very
nicely
to
make
a
banner
bearing
the
legend
she
is
nearly
well
thank
you
and
this
was
displayed
to
the
green
dragon
about
a
fortnight
after
the
arrival
of
the
wonderful
hamper
the
old
gentleman
saw
it
and
waved
a
cheerful
response
from
the
train
and
when
this
had
been
done
the
children
saw
that
now
was
the
time
when
they
must
tell
mother
what
they
had
done
when
she
was
and
it
did
not
seem
nearly
so
easy
as
they
had
thought
it
would
be
but
it
had
to
be
done
and
it
was
done
mother
was
extremely
angry
she
was
seldom
angry
and
now
she
was
angrier
than
they
had
ever
known
her
this
was
horrible
but
it
was
much
worse
when
she
suddenly
began
to
cry
crying
is
catching
i
believe
like
measles
and
at
any
rate
everyone
at
once
found
itself
taking
part
in
a
mother
stopped
first
she
dried
her
eyes
and
then
she
said
i
sorry
i
was
so
angry
darlings
because
i
know
you
we
did
mean
to
be
naughty
mammy
sobbed
bobbie
and
peter
and
phyllis
sniffed
now
listen
said
mother
it
quite
true
that
we
poor
but
we
have
enough
to
live
on
you
must
go
telling
everyone
about
our
affairs
it
not
right
and
you
must
never
never
never
ask
strangers
to
give
you
things
now
always
remember
that
wo
you
they
all
hugged
her
and
rubbed
their
damp
cheeks
against
hers
and
promised
that
they
would
and
i
write
a
letter
to
your
old
gentleman
and
i
shall
tell
him
that
i
did
approve
oh
of
course
i
shall
thank
him
too
for
his
kindness
it
you
i
do
approve
of
my
darlings
not
the
old
gentleman
he
was
as
kind
as
ever
he
could
be
and
you
can
give
the
letter
to
the
station
master
to
give
him
and
we
wo
say
any
more
about
afterwards
when
the
children
were
alone
bobbie
said
is
mother
splendid
you
catch
any
other
saying
they
were
sorry
they
had
been
yes
said
peter
she
is
splendid
but
it
rather
awful
when
she
like
avenging
and
bright
in
the
song
said
phyllis
i
should
like
to
look
at
her
if
it
was
so
awful
she
looks
so
beautiful
when
she
really
downright
they
took
the
letter
down
to
the
station
master
i
thought
you
said
you
had
got
any
friends
except
in
london
said
he
we
made
him
since
said
peter
but
he
does
live
hereabouts
no
we
just
know
him
on
the
then
the
station
master
retired
to
that
sacred
inner
temple
behind
the
little
window
where
the
tickets
are
sold
and
the
children
went
down
to
the
porters
room
and
talked
to
the
porter
they
learned
several
interesting
things
from
him
among
others
that
his
name
was
perks
that
he
was
married
and
had
three
children
that
the
lamps
in
front
of
engines
are
called
and
the
ones
at
the
back
and
that
just
shows
whispered
phyllis
that
trains
really
are
dragons
in
disguise
with
proper
heads
and
it
was
on
this
day
that
the
children
first
noticed
that
all
engines
are
not
alike
alike
said
the
porter
whose
name
was
perks
lor
love
you
no
miss
no
more
alike
nor
what
you
an
me
are
that
little
without
a
tender
as
went
by
just
now
all
on
her
own
that
was
a
tank
that
was
she
off
to
do
some
shunting
side
o
maidbridge
that
as
it
might
be
you
miss
then
there
goods
engines
great
strong
things
with
three
wheels
each
side
joined
with
rods
to
strengthen
as
it
might
be
me
then
there
engines
as
it
might
be
this
young
gentleman
when
he
grows
up
and
wins
all
the
races
at
school
so
he
will
the
engine
she
built
for
speed
as
well
as
power
that
one
to
the
the
green
dragon
said
phyllis
we
calls
her
the
snail
miss
among
ourselves
said
the
porter
oftener
nor
any
train
on
the
but
the
engine
green
said
phyllis
yes
miss
said
perks
so
a
snail
some
seasons
o
the
the
children
agreed
as
they
went
home
to
dinner
that
the
porter
was
most
delightful
company
next
day
was
roberta
birthday
in
the
afternoon
she
was
politely
but
firmly
requested
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
keep
there
till
you
are
to
see
what
we
going
to
do
till
it
done
it
a
glorious
surprise
said
phyllis
and
roberta
went
out
into
the
garden
all
alone
she
tried
to
be
grateful
but
she
felt
she
would
much
rather
have
helped
in
whatever
it
was
than
have
to
spend
her
birthday
afternoon
by
herself
no
matter
how
glorious
the
surprise
might
be
now
that
she
was
alone
she
had
time
to
think
and
one
of
the
things
she
thought
of
most
was
what
mother
had
said
in
one
of
those
feverish
nights
when
her
hands
were
so
hot
and
her
eyes
so
bright
the
words
were
oh
what
a
doctor
bill
there
be
for
this
she
walked
round
and
round
the
garden
among
the
that
any
roses
yet
only
buds
and
the
lilac
bushes
and
syringas
and
american
currants
and
the
more
she
thought
of
the
doctor
bill
the
less
she
liked
the
thought
of
it
and
presently
she
made
up
her
mind
she
went
out
through
the
side
door
of
the
garden
and
climbed
up
the
steep
field
to
where
the
road
runs
along
by
the
canal
she
walked
along
until
she
came
to
the
bridge
that
crosses
the
canal
and
leads
to
the
village
and
here
she
waited
it
was
very
pleasant
in
the
sunshine
to
lean
one
elbows
on
the
warm
stone
of
the
bridge
and
look
down
at
the
blue
water
of
the
canal
bobbie
had
never
seen
any
other
canal
except
the
regent
canal
and
the
water
of
that
is
not
at
all
a
pretty
colour
and
she
had
never
seen
any
river
at
all
except
the
thames
which
also
would
be
all
the
better
if
its
face
was
washed
perhaps
the
children
would
have
loved
the
canal
as
much
as
the
railway
but
for
two
things
one
was
that
they
had
found
the
railway
first
on
that
first
wonderful
morning
when
the
house
and
the
country
and
the
moors
and
rocks
and
great
hills
were
all
new
to
them
they
had
not
found
the
canal
till
some
days
later
the
other
reason
was
that
everyone
on
the
railway
had
been
kind
to
them
the
station
master
the
porter
and
the
old
gentleman
who
waved
and
the
people
on
the
canal
were
anything
but
kind
the
people
on
the
canal
were
of
course
the
bargees
who
steered
the
slow
barges
up
and
down
or
walked
beside
the
old
horses
that
trampled
up
the
mud
of
the
and
strained
at
the
long
peter
had
once
asked
one
of
the
bargees
the
time
and
had
been
told
to
get
out
of
that
in
a
tone
so
fierce
that
he
did
not
stop
to
say
anything
about
his
having
just
as
much
right
on
the
as
the
man
himself
indeed
he
did
not
even
think
of
saying
it
till
some
time
later
then
another
day
when
the
children
thought
they
would
like
to
fish
in
the
canal
a
boy
in
a
barge
threw
lumps
of
coal
at
them
and
one
of
these
hit
phyllis
on
the
back
of
the
neck
she
was
just
stooping
down
to
tie
up
her
bootlace
and
though
the
coal
hardly
hurt
at
all
it
made
her
not
care
very
much
about
going
on
fishing
on
the
bridge
however
roberta
felt
quite
safe
because
she
could
look
down
on
the
canal
and
if
any
boy
showed
signs
of
meaning
to
throw
coal
she
could
duck
behind
the
parapet
presently
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
which
was
just
what
she
expected
the
wheels
were
the
wheels
of
the
doctor
dogcart
and
in
the
cart
of
course
was
the
doctor
he
pulled
up
and
called
out
hullo
head
nurse
want
a
lift
i
wanted
to
see
you
said
bobbie
your
mother
not
worse
i
hope
said
the
doctor
no
but
well
skip
in
then
and
we
go
for
a
roberta
climbed
in
and
the
brown
horse
was
made
to
turn
round
which
it
did
not
like
at
all
for
it
was
looking
forward
to
its
tea
i
mean
its
oats
this
is
jolly
said
bobbie
as
the
dogcart
flew
along
the
road
by
the
canal
we
could
throw
a
stone
down
any
one
of
your
three
chimneys
said
the
doctor
as
they
passed
the
house
yes
said
bobbie
but
you
have
to
be
a
jolly
good
how
do
you
know
i
not
said
the
doctor
now
then
what
the
trouble
bobbie
fidgeted
with
the
hook
of
the
driving
apron
come
out
with
it
said
the
doctor
it
rather
hard
you
see
said
bobbie
to
out
with
it
because
of
what
mother
what
did
mother
say
she
said
i
was
to
go
telling
everyone
that
we
poor
but
you
are
everyone
are
you
not
at
all
said
the
doctor
cheerfully
well
well
i
know
doctors
are
very
extravagant
i
mean
expensive
and
viney
told
me
that
her
doctoring
only
cost
her
twopence
a
week
because
she
belonged
to
a
yes
you
see
she
told
me
what
a
good
doctor
you
were
and
i
asked
her
how
she
could
afford
you
because
she
much
poorer
than
we
are
i
been
in
her
house
and
i
know
and
then
she
told
me
about
the
club
and
i
thought
i
ask
you
and
oh
i
do
want
mother
to
be
worried
we
be
in
the
club
too
the
same
as
viney
the
doctor
was
silent
he
was
rather
poor
himself
and
he
had
been
pleased
at
getting
a
new
family
to
attend
so
i
think
his
feelings
at
that
minute
were
rather
mixed
you
are
cross
with
me
are
you
said
bobbie
in
a
very
small
voice
the
doctor
roused
himself
cross
how
could
i
be
you
a
very
sensible
little
woman
now
look
here
do
you
worry
i
make
it
all
right
with
your
mother
even
if
i
have
to
make
a
special
club
all
for
her
look
here
this
is
where
the
aqueduct
what
an
aque
what
its
name
asked
bobbie
a
water
bridge
said
the
doctor
the
road
rose
to
a
bridge
over
the
canal
to
the
left
was
a
steep
rocky
cliff
with
trees
and
shrubs
growing
in
the
cracks
of
the
rock
and
the
canal
here
left
off
running
along
the
top
of
the
hill
and
started
to
run
on
a
bridge
of
its
own
a
great
bridge
with
tall
arches
that
went
right
across
the
valley
bobbie
drew
a
long
breath
it
is
grand
is
it
she
said
it
like
pictures
in
the
history
of
right
said
the
doctor
that
just
exactly
what
it
is
like
the
romans
were
dead
nuts
on
aqueducts
it
a
splendid
piece
of
i
thought
engineering
was
making
ah
there
are
different
sorts
of
engineering
making
road
and
bridges
and
tunnels
is
one
kind
and
making
fortifications
is
another
well
we
must
be
turning
back
and
remember
you
are
to
worry
about
bills
or
you
be
ill
yourself
and
then
i
send
you
in
a
bill
as
long
as
the
when
bobbie
had
parted
from
the
doctor
at
the
top
of
the
field
that
ran
down
from
the
road
to
three
chimneys
she
could
not
feel
that
she
had
done
wrong
she
knew
that
mother
would
perhaps
think
differently
but
bobbie
felt
that
for
once
she
was
the
one
who
was
right
and
she
scrambled
down
the
rocky
slope
with
a
really
happy
feeling
phyllis
and
peter
met
her
at
the
back
door
they
were
unnaturally
clean
and
neat
and
phyllis
had
a
red
bow
in
her
hair
there
was
only
just
time
for
bobbie
to
make
herself
tidy
and
tie
up
her
hair
with
a
blue
bow
before
a
little
bell
rang
there
said
phyllis
that
to
show
the
surprise
is
ready
now
you
wait
till
the
bell
rings
again
and
then
you
may
come
into
the
so
bobbie
waited
tinkle
tinkle
said
the
little
bell
and
bobbie
went
into
the
feeling
rather
shy
directly
she
opened
the
door
she
found
herself
as
it
seemed
in
a
new
world
of
light
and
flowers
and
singing
mother
and
peter
and
phyllis
were
standing
in
a
row
at
the
end
of
the
table
the
shutters
were
shut
and
there
were
twelve
candles
on
the
table
one
for
each
of
roberta
years
the
table
was
covered
with
a
sort
of
pattern
of
flowers
and
at
roberta
place
was
a
thick
wreath
of
and
several
most
interesting
little
packages
and
mother
and
phyllis
and
peter
were
singing
to
the
first
part
of
the
tune
of
patrick
day
roberta
knew
that
mother
had
written
the
words
on
purpose
for
her
birthday
it
was
a
little
way
of
mother
on
birthdays
it
had
begun
on
bobbie
fourth
birthday
when
phyllis
was
a
baby
bobbie
remembered
learning
the
verses
to
say
to
father
a
surprise
she
wondered
if
mother
had
remembered
too
the
verse
had
been
daddy
dear
i
only
four
and
i
rather
not
be
more
four
the
nicest
age
to
be
two
and
two
and
one
and
three
what
i
love
is
two
and
two
mother
peter
phil
and
you
what
you
love
is
one
and
three
mother
peter
phil
and
me
give
your
little
girl
a
kiss
because
she
learned
and
told
you
this
the
song
the
others
were
singing
now
went
like
this
our
darling
roberta
no
sorrow
shall
hurt
her
if
we
can
prevent
it
her
whole
life
long
her
birthday
our
fete
day
we
make
it
our
great
day
and
give
her
our
presents
and
sing
her
our
song
may
pleasures
attend
her
and
may
the
fates
send
her
the
happiest
journey
along
her
life
way
with
skies
bright
above
her
and
dear
ones
to
love
her
dear
bob
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
when
they
had
finished
singing
they
cried
three
cheers
for
our
bobbie
and
gave
them
very
loudly
bobbie
felt
exactly
as
though
she
were
going
to
cry
you
know
that
odd
feeling
in
the
bridge
of
your
nose
and
the
pricking
in
your
eyelids
but
before
she
had
time
to
begin
they
were
all
kissing
and
hugging
her
now
said
mother
look
at
your
they
were
very
nice
presents
there
was
a
green
and
red
that
phyllis
had
made
herself
in
secret
moments
there
was
a
darling
little
silver
brooch
of
mother
shaped
like
a
buttercup
which
bobbie
had
known
and
loved
for
years
but
which
she
had
never
never
thought
would
come
to
be
her
very
own
there
was
also
a
pair
of
blue
glass
vases
from
viney
roberta
had
seen
and
admired
them
in
the
village
shop
and
there
were
three
birthday
cards
with
pretty
pictures
and
wishes
mother
fitted
the
crown
on
bobbie
brown
head
and
now
look
at
the
table
she
said
there
was
a
cake
on
the
table
covered
with
white
sugar
with
bobbie
on
it
in
pink
sweets
and
there
were
buns
and
jam
but
the
nicest
thing
was
that
the
big
table
was
almost
covered
with
flowers
wallflowers
were
laid
all
round
the
there
was
a
ring
of
round
each
plate
the
cake
had
a
wreath
of
white
lilac
round
it
and
in
the
middle
was
something
that
looked
like
a
pattern
all
done
with
single
blooms
of
lilac
or
wallflower
or
laburnum
it
a
map
a
map
of
the
railway
cried
peter
look
those
lilac
lines
are
the
metals
and
there
the
station
done
in
brown
wallflowers
the
laburnum
is
the
train
and
there
are
the
and
the
road
up
to
here
and
those
fat
red
daisies
are
us
three
waving
to
the
old
gentleman
that
him
the
pansy
in
the
laburnum
and
there
chimneys
done
in
the
purple
primroses
said
phyllis
and
that
little
tiny
is
mother
looking
out
for
us
when
we
late
for
tea
peter
invented
it
all
and
we
got
all
the
flowers
from
the
station
we
thought
you
like
it
that
my
present
said
peter
suddenly
dumping
down
his
adored
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
its
tender
had
been
lined
with
fresh
white
paper
and
was
full
of
sweets
oh
peter
cried
bobbie
quite
overcome
by
this
munificence
not
your
own
dear
little
engine
that
you
so
fond
of
oh
no
said
peter
very
promptly
not
the
engine
only
the
bobbie
could
help
her
face
changing
a
little
not
so
much
because
she
was
disappointed
at
not
getting
the
engine
as
because
she
had
thought
it
so
very
noble
of
peter
and
now
she
felt
she
had
been
silly
to
think
it
also
she
felt
she
must
have
seemed
greedy
to
expect
the
engine
as
well
as
the
sweets
so
her
face
changed
peter
saw
it
he
hesitated
a
minute
then
his
face
changed
too
and
he
said
i
mean
not
all
the
engine
i
let
you
go
halves
if
you
you
a
brick
cried
bobbie
it
a
splendid
she
said
no
more
aloud
but
to
herself
she
said
that
was
awfully
jolly
decent
of
peter
because
i
know
he
did
mean
to
well
the
broken
half
shall
be
my
half
of
the
engine
and
i
get
it
mended
and
give
it
back
to
peter
for
his
yes
mother
dear
i
should
like
to
cut
the
cake
she
added
and
tea
began
it
was
a
delightful
birthday
after
tea
mother
played
games
with
them
any
game
they
liked
and
of
course
their
first
choice
was
in
the
course
of
which
bobbie
wreath
twisted
itself
crookedly
over
one
of
her
ears
and
stayed
there
then
when
it
was
near
and
time
to
calm
down
mother
had
a
lovely
new
story
to
read
to
them
you
wo
sit
up
late
working
will
you
mother
bobbie
asked
as
they
said
good
night
and
mother
said
no
she
would
she
would
only
just
write
to
father
and
then
go
to
bed
but
when
bobbie
crept
down
later
to
bring
up
her
presents
for
she
felt
she
really
could
not
be
separated
from
them
all
night
mother
was
not
writing
but
leaning
her
head
on
her
arms
and
her
arms
on
the
table
i
think
it
was
rather
good
of
bobbie
to
slip
quietly
away
saying
over
and
over
she
does
want
me
to
know
she
unhappy
and
i
wo
know
i
wo
but
it
made
a
sad
end
to
the
birthday
the
very
next
morning
bobbie
began
to
watch
her
opportunity
to
get
peter
engine
mended
secretly
and
the
opportunity
came
the
very
next
afternoon
mother
went
by
train
to
the
nearest
town
to
do
shopping
when
she
went
there
she
always
went
to
the
perhaps
to
post
her
letters
to
father
for
she
never
gave
them
to
the
children
or
viney
to
post
and
she
never
went
to
the
village
herself
peter
and
phyllis
went
with
her
bobbie
wanted
an
excuse
not
to
go
but
try
as
she
would
she
could
think
of
a
good
one
and
just
when
she
felt
that
all
was
lost
her
frock
caught
on
a
big
nail
by
the
kitchen
door
and
there
was
a
great
tear
all
along
the
front
of
the
skirt
i
assure
you
this
was
really
an
accident
so
the
others
pitied
her
and
went
without
her
for
there
was
no
time
for
her
to
change
because
they
were
rather
late
already
and
had
to
hurry
to
the
station
to
catch
the
train
when
they
had
gone
bobbie
put
on
her
everyday
frock
and
went
down
to
the
railway
she
did
not
go
into
the
station
but
she
went
along
the
line
to
the
end
of
the
platform
where
the
engine
is
when
the
down
train
is
alongside
the
platform
the
place
where
there
are
a
water
tank
and
a
long
limp
leather
hose
like
an
elephant
trunk
she
hid
behind
a
bush
on
the
other
side
of
the
railway
she
had
the
toy
engine
done
up
in
brown
paper
and
she
waited
patiently
with
it
under
her
arm
then
when
the
next
train
came
in
and
stopped
bobbie
went
across
the
metals
of
the
and
stood
beside
the
engine
she
had
never
been
so
close
to
an
engine
before
it
looked
much
larger
and
harder
than
she
had
expected
and
it
made
her
feel
very
small
indeed
and
somehow
very
soft
as
if
she
could
very
very
easily
be
hurt
rather
badly
i
know
what
feel
like
now
said
bobbie
to
herself
the
and
fireman
did
not
see
her
they
were
leaning
out
on
the
other
side
telling
the
porter
a
tale
about
a
dog
and
a
leg
of
mutton
if
you
please
said
roberta
but
the
engine
was
blowing
off
steam
and
no
one
heard
her
if
you
please
engineer
she
spoke
a
little
louder
but
the
engine
happened
to
speak
at
the
same
moment
and
of
course
roberta
soft
little
voice
had
a
chance
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
only
way
would
be
to
climb
on
to
the
engine
and
pull
at
their
coats
the
step
was
high
but
she
got
her
knee
on
it
and
clambered
into
the
cab
she
stumbled
and
fell
on
hands
and
knees
on
the
base
of
the
great
heap
of
coals
that
led
up
to
the
square
opening
in
the
tender
the
engine
was
not
above
the
weaknesses
of
its
fellows
it
was
making
a
great
deal
more
noise
than
there
was
the
slightest
need
for
and
just
as
roberta
fell
on
the
coals
the
who
had
turned
without
seeing
her
started
the
engine
and
when
bobbie
had
picked
herself
up
the
train
was
moving
not
fast
but
much
too
fast
for
her
to
get
off
all
sorts
of
dreadful
thoughts
came
to
her
all
together
in
one
horrible
flash
there
were
such
things
as
express
trains
that
went
on
she
supposed
for
hundreds
of
miles
without
stopping
suppose
this
should
be
one
of
them
how
would
she
get
home
again
she
had
no
money
to
pay
for
the
return
journey
and
i
no
business
here
i
an
that
what
i
am
she
thought
i
should
wonder
if
they
could
lock
me
up
for
and
the
train
was
going
faster
and
faster
there
was
something
in
her
throat
that
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
speak
she
tried
twice
the
men
had
their
backs
to
her
they
were
doing
something
to
things
that
looked
like
taps
suddenly
she
put
out
her
hand
and
caught
hold
of
the
nearest
sleeve
the
man
turned
with
a
start
and
he
and
roberta
stood
for
a
minute
looking
at
each
other
in
silence
then
the
silence
was
broken
by
them
both
the
man
said
here
a
bloomin
go
and
roberta
burst
into
tears
the
other
man
said
he
was
blooming
well
blest
or
something
like
it
but
though
naturally
surprised
they
were
not
exactly
unkind
you
a
naughty
little
gell
that
what
you
are
said
the
fireman
and
the
said
daring
little
piece
i
call
her
but
they
made
her
sit
down
on
an
iron
seat
in
the
cab
and
told
her
to
stop
crying
and
tell
them
what
she
meant
by
it
she
did
stop
as
soon
as
she
could
one
thing
that
helped
her
was
the
thought
that
peter
would
give
almost
his
ears
to
be
in
her
place
on
a
real
engine
really
going
the
children
had
often
wondered
whether
any
could
be
found
noble
enough
to
take
them
for
a
ride
on
an
engine
and
now
there
she
was
she
dried
her
eyes
and
sniffed
earnestly
now
then
said
the
fireman
out
with
it
what
do
you
mean
by
it
eh
oh
please
sniffed
bobbie
try
again
said
the
encouragingly
bobbie
tried
again
please
engineer
she
said
i
did
call
out
to
you
from
the
line
but
you
did
hear
me
and
i
just
climbed
up
to
touch
you
on
the
arm
quite
gently
i
meant
to
do
it
and
then
i
fell
into
the
coals
and
i
am
so
sorry
if
i
frightened
you
oh
do
be
cross
oh
please
do
she
sniffed
again
we
ai
so
much
cross
said
the
fireman
as
interested
like
it
ai
every
day
a
little
gell
tumbles
into
our
coal
bunker
outer
the
sky
is
it
bill
what
did
you
do
it
for
eh
that
the
point
agreed
the
what
did
you
do
it
for
bobbie
found
that
she
had
not
quite
stopped
crying
the
patted
her
on
the
back
and
said
here
cheer
up
mate
it
ai
so
bad
as
all
that
i
be
i
wanted
said
bobbie
much
cheered
to
find
herself
addressed
as
i
only
wanted
to
ask
you
if
you
be
so
kind
as
to
mend
she
picked
up
the
parcel
from
among
the
coals
and
undid
the
string
with
hot
red
fingers
that
trembled
her
feet
and
legs
felt
the
scorch
of
the
engine
fire
but
her
shoulders
felt
the
wild
chill
rush
of
the
air
the
engine
lurched
and
shook
and
rattled
and
as
they
shot
under
a
bridge
the
engine
seemed
to
shout
in
her
ears
the
fireman
shovelled
on
coals
bobbie
unrolled
the
brown
paper
and
disclosed
the
toy
engine
i
thought
she
said
wistfully
that
perhaps
you
mend
this
for
me
because
you
an
engineer
you
the
said
he
was
blowed
if
he
was
blest
i
blest
if
i
ai
blowed
remarked
the
fireman
but
the
took
the
little
engine
and
looked
at
it
and
the
fireman
ceased
for
an
instant
to
shovel
coal
and
looked
too
it
like
your
precious
cheek
said
the
whatever
made
you
think
we
be
bothered
tinkering
penny
toys
i
did
mean
it
for
precious
cheek
said
bobbie
only
everybody
that
has
anything
to
do
with
railways
is
so
kind
and
good
i
did
think
you
mind
you
do
really
do
you
she
added
for
she
had
seen
a
not
unkindly
wink
pass
between
the
two
my
trade
driving
of
an
engine
not
mending
her
especially
such
a
in
engines
as
this
said
bill
an
are
we
to
get
you
back
to
your
sorrowing
friends
and
relations
and
all
be
forgiven
and
forgotten
if
you
put
me
down
next
time
you
stop
said
bobbie
firmly
though
her
heart
beat
fiercely
against
her
arm
as
she
clasped
her
hands
and
lend
me
the
money
for
a
ticket
i
pay
you
back
honour
bright
i
not
a
confidence
trick
like
in
the
newspapers
really
you
a
little
lady
every
inch
said
bill
relenting
suddenly
and
completely
we
see
you
gets
home
safe
an
about
this
engine
jim
ai
you
got
a
pal
as
can
use
a
soldering
iron
seems
to
me
that
about
all
the
little
bounder
wants
doing
to
that
what
father
said
bobbie
explained
eagerly
what
that
for
she
pointed
to
a
little
brass
wheel
that
he
had
turned
as
he
spoke
that
the
in
what
injector
to
fill
up
the
oh
said
bobbie
mentally
registering
the
fact
to
tell
the
others
that
is
this
the
automatic
brake
bill
went
on
flattered
by
her
enthusiasm
you
just
move
this
little
handle
do
it
with
one
finger
you
can
and
the
train
jolly
soon
stops
that
what
they
call
the
power
of
science
in
the
he
showed
her
two
little
dials
like
clock
faces
and
told
her
how
one
showed
how
much
steam
was
going
and
the
other
showed
if
the
brake
was
working
properly
by
the
time
she
had
seen
him
shut
off
steam
with
a
big
shining
steel
handle
bobbie
knew
more
about
the
inside
working
of
an
engine
than
she
had
ever
thought
there
was
to
know
and
jim
had
promised
that
his
second
cousin
wife
brother
should
solder
the
toy
engine
or
jim
would
know
the
reason
why
besides
all
the
knowledge
she
had
gained
bobbie
felt
that
she
and
bill
and
jim
were
now
friends
for
life
and
that
they
had
wholly
and
forever
forgiven
her
for
stumbling
uninvited
among
the
sacred
coals
of
their
tender
at
stacklepoole
junction
she
parted
from
them
with
warm
expressions
of
mutual
regard
they
handed
her
over
to
the
guard
of
a
returning
train
a
friend
of
theirs
and
she
had
the
joy
of
knowing
what
guards
do
in
their
secret
fastnesses
and
understood
how
when
you
pull
the
communication
cord
in
railway
carriages
a
wheel
goes
round
under
the
guard
nose
and
a
loud
bell
rings
in
his
ears
she
asked
the
guard
why
his
van
smelt
so
fishy
and
learned
that
he
had
to
carry
a
lot
of
fish
every
day
and
that
the
wetness
in
the
hollows
of
the
corrugated
floor
had
all
drained
out
of
boxes
full
of
plaice
and
cod
and
mackerel
and
soles
and
smelts
bobbie
got
home
in
time
for
tea
and
she
felt
as
though
her
mind
would
burst
with
all
that
had
been
put
into
it
since
she
parted
from
the
others
how
she
blessed
the
nail
that
had
torn
her
frock
where
have
you
been
asked
the
others
to
the
station
of
course
said
roberta
but
she
would
not
tell
a
word
of
her
adventures
till
the
day
appointed
when
she
mysteriously
led
them
to
the
station
at
the
hour
of
the
transit
and
proudly
introduced
them
to
her
friends
bill
and
jim
jim
second
cousin
wife
brother
had
not
been
unworthy
of
the
sacred
trust
reposed
in
him
the
toy
engine
was
literally
as
good
as
new
oh
said
bobbie
just
before
the
engine
screamed
its
i
shall
always
always
love
you
and
jim
second
cousin
wife
brother
as
well
and
as
the
three
children
went
home
up
the
hill
peter
hugging
the
engine
now
quite
its
own
self
again
bobbie
told
with
joyous
leaps
of
the
heart
the
story
of
how
she
had
been
an
chapter
prisoners
and
captives
it
was
one
day
when
mother
had
gone
to
maidbridge
she
had
gone
alone
but
the
children
were
to
go
to
the
station
to
meet
her
and
loving
the
station
as
they
did
it
was
only
natural
that
they
should
be
there
a
good
hour
before
there
was
any
chance
of
mother
train
arriving
even
if
the
train
were
punctual
which
was
most
unlikely
no
doubt
they
would
have
been
just
as
early
even
if
it
had
been
a
fine
day
and
all
the
delights
of
woods
and
fields
and
rocks
and
rivers
had
been
open
to
them
but
it
happened
to
be
a
very
wet
day
and
for
july
very
cold
there
was
a
wild
wind
that
drove
flocks
of
dark
purple
clouds
across
the
sky
like
herds
of
as
phyllis
said
and
the
rain
stung
sharply
so
that
the
way
to
the
station
was
finished
at
a
run
then
the
rain
fell
faster
and
harder
and
beat
slantwise
against
the
windows
of
the
booking
office
and
of
the
chill
place
that
had
general
waiting
room
on
its
door
it
like
being
in
a
besieged
castle
phyllis
said
look
at
the
arrows
of
the
foe
striking
against
the
battlements
it
much
more
like
a
great
said
peter
they
decided
to
wait
on
the
up
side
for
the
down
platform
looked
very
wet
indeed
and
the
rain
was
driving
right
into
the
little
bleak
shelter
where
have
to
wait
for
their
trains
the
hour
would
be
full
of
incident
and
of
interest
for
there
would
be
two
up
trains
and
one
down
to
look
at
before
the
one
that
should
bring
mother
back
perhaps
it
have
stopped
raining
by
then
said
bobbie
anyhow
glad
i
brought
mother
waterproof
and
they
went
into
the
desert
spot
labelled
general
waiting
room
and
the
time
passed
pleasantly
enough
in
a
game
of
advertisements
you
know
the
game
of
course
it
is
something
like
dumb
crambo
the
players
take
it
in
turns
to
go
out
and
then
come
back
and
look
as
like
some
advertisement
as
they
can
and
the
others
have
to
guess
what
advertisement
it
is
meant
to
be
bobbie
came
in
and
sat
down
under
mother
umbrella
and
made
a
sharp
face
and
everyone
knew
she
was
the
fox
who
sits
under
the
umbrella
in
the
advertisement
phyllis
tried
to
make
a
magic
carpet
of
mother
waterproof
but
it
would
not
stand
out
stiff
and
as
a
magic
carpet
should
and
nobody
could
guess
it
everyone
thought
peter
was
carrying
things
a
little
too
far
when
he
blacked
his
face
all
over
with
and
struck
a
spidery
attitude
and
said
he
was
the
blot
that
advertises
somebody
blue
black
writing
fluid
it
was
phyllis
turn
again
and
she
was
trying
to
look
like
the
sphinx
that
advertises
personally
conducted
tours
up
the
nile
when
the
sharp
ting
of
the
signal
announced
the
up
train
the
children
rushed
out
to
see
it
pass
on
its
engine
were
the
particular
driver
and
fireman
who
were
now
numbered
among
the
children
dearest
friends
courtesies
passed
between
them
jim
asked
after
the
toy
engine
and
bobbie
pressed
on
his
acceptance
a
moist
greasy
package
of
toffee
that
she
had
made
herself
charmed
by
this
attention
the
consented
to
consider
her
request
that
some
day
he
would
take
peter
for
a
ride
on
the
engine
stand
back
mates
cried
the
suddenly
and
horf
she
and
sure
enough
off
the
train
went
the
children
watched
the
of
the
train
till
it
disappeared
round
the
curve
of
the
line
and
then
turned
to
go
back
to
the
dusty
freedom
of
the
general
waiting
room
and
the
joys
of
the
advertisement
game
they
expected
to
see
just
one
or
two
people
the
end
of
the
procession
of
passengers
who
had
given
up
their
tickets
and
gone
away
instead
the
platform
round
the
door
of
the
station
had
a
dark
blot
round
it
and
the
dark
blot
was
a
crowd
of
people
oh
cried
peter
with
a
thrill
of
joyous
excitement
happened
come
on
they
ran
down
the
platform
when
they
got
to
the
crowd
they
could
of
course
see
nothing
but
the
damp
backs
and
elbows
of
the
people
on
the
crowd
outside
everybody
was
talking
at
once
it
was
evident
that
something
had
happened
it
my
belief
he
nothing
worse
than
a
natural
said
a
person
peter
saw
his
red
face
as
he
spoke
if
you
ask
me
i
should
say
it
was
a
police
court
case
said
a
young
man
with
a
black
bag
not
it
the
infirmary
more
like
then
the
voice
of
the
station
master
was
heard
firm
and
official
now
then
move
along
there
i
attend
to
this
if
you
but
the
crowd
did
not
move
and
then
came
a
voice
that
thrilled
the
children
through
and
through
for
it
spoke
in
a
foreign
language
and
what
is
more
it
was
a
language
that
they
had
never
heard
they
had
heard
french
spoken
and
german
aunt
emma
knew
german
and
used
to
sing
a
song
about
bedeuten
and
zeiten
and
bin
and
sin
nor
was
it
latin
peter
had
been
in
latin
for
four
terms
it
was
some
comfort
anyhow
to
find
that
none
of
the
crowd
understood
the
foreign
language
any
better
than
the
children
did
what
that
he
saying
asked
the
farmer
heavily
sounds
like
french
to
me
said
the
station
master
who
had
once
been
to
boulogne
for
the
day
it
is
french
cried
peter
what
is
it
then
asked
more
than
one
voice
the
crowd
fell
back
a
little
to
see
who
had
spoken
and
peter
pressed
forward
so
that
when
the
crowd
closed
up
again
he
was
in
the
front
rank
i
do
know
what
it
is
said
peter
but
it
is
french
i
know
then
he
saw
what
it
was
that
the
crowd
had
for
its
centre
it
was
a
man
the
man
peter
did
not
doubt
who
had
spoken
in
that
strange
tongue
a
man
with
long
hair
and
wild
eyes
with
shabby
clothes
of
a
cut
peter
had
not
seen
before
a
man
whose
hands
and
lips
trembled
and
who
spoke
again
as
his
eyes
fell
on
peter
no
it
not
french
said
peter
try
him
with
french
if
you
know
so
much
about
it
said
the
parlay
voo
frongsay
began
peter
boldly
and
the
next
moment
the
crowd
recoiled
again
for
the
man
with
the
wild
eyes
had
left
leaning
against
the
wall
and
had
sprung
forward
and
caught
peter
hands
and
begun
to
pour
forth
a
flood
of
words
which
though
he
could
not
understand
a
word
of
them
peter
knew
the
sound
of
there
said
he
and
turned
his
hands
still
clasped
in
the
hands
of
the
strange
shabby
figure
to
throw
a
glance
of
triumph
at
the
crowd
there
that
what
does
he
say
i
do
peter
was
obliged
to
own
it
here
said
the
station
master
again
you
move
on
if
you
please
deal
with
this
a
few
of
the
more
timid
or
less
inquisitive
travellers
moved
slowly
and
reluctantly
away
and
phyllis
and
bobbie
got
near
to
peter
all
three
had
been
taught
french
at
school
how
deeply
they
now
wished
that
they
had
learned
it
peter
shook
his
head
at
the
stranger
but
he
also
shook
his
hands
as
warmly
and
looked
at
him
as
kindly
as
he
could
a
person
in
the
crowd
after
some
hesitation
said
suddenly
no
comprenny
and
then
blushing
deeply
backed
out
of
the
press
and
went
away
take
him
into
your
room
whispered
bobbie
to
the
station
master
mother
can
talk
french
she
be
here
by
the
next
train
from
the
station
master
took
the
arm
of
the
stranger
suddenly
but
not
unkindly
but
the
man
wrenched
his
arm
away
and
cowered
back
coughing
and
trembling
and
trying
to
push
the
station
master
away
oh
do
said
bobbie
do
you
see
how
frightened
he
is
he
thinks
you
going
to
shut
him
up
i
know
he
does
look
at
his
eyes
they
like
a
fox
eyes
when
the
beast
in
a
trap
said
the
farmer
oh
let
me
try
bobbie
went
on
i
do
really
know
one
or
two
french
words
if
i
could
only
think
of
sometimes
in
moments
of
great
need
we
can
do
wonderful
things
things
that
in
ordinary
life
we
could
hardly
even
dream
of
doing
bobbie
had
never
been
anywhere
near
the
top
of
her
french
class
but
she
must
have
learned
something
without
knowing
it
for
now
looking
at
those
wild
hunted
eyes
she
actually
remembered
and
what
is
more
spoke
some
french
words
she
said
vous
attendre
ma
mere
parlez
francais
nous
what
the
french
for
kind
nobody
knew
bong
is
said
phyllis
nous
etre
bong
pour
i
do
not
know
whether
the
man
understood
her
words
but
he
understood
the
touch
of
the
hand
she
thrust
into
his
and
the
kindness
of
the
other
hand
that
stroked
his
shabby
sleeve
she
pulled
him
gently
towards
the
inmost
sanctuary
of
the
station
master
the
other
children
followed
and
the
station
master
shut
the
door
in
the
face
of
the
crowd
which
stood
a
little
while
in
the
booking
office
talking
and
looking
at
the
fast
closed
yellow
door
and
then
by
ones
and
twos
went
its
way
grumbling
inside
the
station
master
room
bobbie
still
held
the
stranger
hand
and
stroked
his
sleeve
here
a
go
said
the
station
master
no
ticket
does
even
know
where
he
wants
to
go
i
not
sure
now
but
what
i
ought
to
send
for
the
oh
do
all
the
children
pleaded
at
once
and
suddenly
bobbie
got
between
the
others
and
the
stranger
for
she
had
seen
that
he
was
crying
by
a
most
unusual
piece
of
good
fortune
she
had
a
handkerchief
in
her
pocket
by
a
still
more
uncommon
accident
the
handkerchief
was
moderately
clean
standing
in
front
of
the
stranger
she
got
out
the
handkerchief
and
passed
it
to
him
so
that
the
others
did
not
see
wait
till
mother
comes
phyllis
was
saying
she
does
speak
french
beautifully
you
just
love
to
hear
i
sure
he
has
done
anything
like
you
sent
to
prison
for
said
peter
looks
like
without
visible
means
to
me
said
the
station
master
well
i
do
mind
giving
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
till
your
mamma
comes
i
should
like
to
know
what
nation
got
the
credit
of
him
that
i
then
peter
had
an
idea
he
pulled
an
envelope
out
of
his
pocket
and
showed
that
it
was
half
full
of
foreign
stamps
look
here
he
said
let
show
him
these
bobbie
looked
and
saw
that
the
stranger
had
dried
his
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
so
she
said
all
they
showed
him
an
italian
stamp
and
pointed
from
him
to
it
and
back
again
and
made
signs
of
question
with
their
eyebrows
he
shook
his
head
then
they
showed
him
a
norwegian
stamp
the
common
blue
kind
it
was
and
again
he
signed
no
then
they
showed
him
a
spanish
one
and
at
that
he
took
the
envelope
from
peter
hand
and
searched
among
the
stamps
with
a
hand
that
trembled
the
hand
that
he
reached
out
at
last
with
a
gesture
as
of
one
answering
a
question
contained
a
russian
stamp
he
russian
cried
peter
or
else
he
like
man
who
was
in
kipling
you
the
train
from
maidbridge
was
signalled
i
stay
with
him
till
you
bring
mother
in
said
bobbie
you
not
afraid
missie
oh
no
said
bobbie
looking
at
the
stranger
as
she
might
have
looked
at
a
strange
dog
of
doubtful
temper
you
would
hurt
me
would
you
she
smiled
at
him
and
he
smiled
back
a
queer
crooked
smile
and
then
he
coughed
again
and
the
heavy
rattling
swish
of
the
incoming
train
swept
past
and
the
station
master
and
peter
and
phyllis
went
out
to
meet
it
bobbie
was
still
holding
the
stranger
hand
when
they
came
back
with
mother
the
russian
rose
and
bowed
very
ceremoniously
then
mother
spoke
in
french
and
he
replied
haltingly
at
first
but
presently
in
longer
and
longer
sentences
the
children
watching
his
face
and
mother
knew
that
he
was
telling
her
things
that
made
her
angry
and
pitying
and
sorry
and
indignant
all
at
once
well
mum
what
it
all
about
the
station
master
could
not
restrain
his
curiosity
any
longer
oh
said
mother

all
right
he
a
russian
and
he
lost
his
ticket
and
i
afraid

very
ill

run
down
and

you
all
about
him

hope

wo
find

a
frozen
viper
said
the
station
master
doubtfully
oh
no
mother
said
brightly
and
she
smiled
i
quite
sure
not
why

great
man
in
his
own
country
writes
books
beautiful
books
i
read
some
of
them
but
i
tell
you
all
about
it
she
spoke
again
in
french
to
the
russian
and
everyone
could
see
the
surprise
and
pleasure
and
gratitude
in
his
eyes
he
got
up
and
politely
bowed
to
the
station
master
and
offered
his
arm
most
ceremoniously
to
mother
she
took
it
but
anybody
could
have
seen
that
she
was
helping
him
along
and
not
he
her
you
girls

home
and
light
a
fire
in
the
mother
said
and
peter
had
better
go
for
the
but
it
was
bobbie
who
went
for
the
doctor
i
hate
to
tell
you
she
said
breathlessly
when
she
came
upon
him
in
his
shirt
sleeves
weeding
his
but
mother
got
a
very
shabby
russian
and
i
sure

any
money

found
him
at
the
found

then
asked
the
doctor
reaching
for
his
coat
yes

bobbie
unexpectedly
that
just
what
he
was
he
been
telling
mother
the
sad
sweet
story
of
his
life
in
french
and
she
said
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
come
directly
if
you
were
at
home
he
has
a
dreadful
cough
and
he
been
the
doctor
smiled
oh

bobbie

i
never

a
man

know
what
it
forrest
wished
then
that
he
had
smiled
when
bobbie
and
the
doctor
got
to
three
chimneys
the
russian
was
sitting
in
the
that
had
been
father
stretching
his
feet
to
the
blaze
of
a
bright
wood
fire
and
sipping
the
tea
mother
had
made
him
the
man
seems
worn
out
mind
and
body
was
what
the
doctor
said
the
cough
bad
but
there
nothing
that
ca
be
cured
he
ought
to
go
straight
to
bed
though
and
let
him
have
a
fire
at
i
make
one
in
my
room
it
the
only
one
with
a
fireplace
said
mother
she
did
and
presently
the
doctor
helped
the
stranger
to
bed
there
was
a
big
black
trunk
in
mother
room
that
none
of
the
children
had
ever
seen
unlocked
now
when
she
had
lighted
the
fire
she
unlocked
it
and
took
some
clothes
out
men
clothes
and
set
them
to
air
by
the
newly
lighted
fire
bobbie
coming
in
with
more
wood
for
the
fire
saw
the
mark
on
the
and
looked
over
to
the
open
trunk
all
the
things
she
could
see
were
men
clothes
and
the
name
marked
on
the
shirt
was
father
name
then
father
had
taken
his
clothes
with
him
and
that
was
one
of
father
new
ones
bobbie
remembered
its
being
made
just
before
peter
birthday
why
had
father
taken
his
clothes
bobbie
slipped
from
the
room
as
she
went
she
heard
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
of
the
trunk
her
heart
was
beating
horribly
why
had
father
taken
his
clothes
when
mother
came
out
of
the
room
bobbie
flung
tightly
clasping
arms
round
her
waist
and
whispered
mother
daddy
is
is
dead
is
he
my
darling
no
what
made
you
think
of
anything
so
horrible
i
i
do
know
said
bobbie
angry
with
herself
but
still
clinging
to
that
resolution
of
hers
not
to
see
anything
that
mother
did
mean
her
to
see
mother
gave
her
a
hurried
hug
daddy
was
quite
quite
well
when
i
heard
from
him
last
she
said
and
he
come
back
to
us
some
day
fancy
such
horrible
things
darling
later
on
when
the
russian
stranger
had
been
made
comfortable
for
the
night
mother
came
into
the
girls
room
she
was
to
sleep
there
in
phyllis
bed
and
phyllis
was
to
have
a
mattress
on
the
floor
a
most
amusing
adventure
for
phyllis
directly
mother
came
in
two
white
figures
started
up
and
two
eager
voices
called
now
mother
tell
us
all
about
the
russian
a
white
shape
hopped
into
the
room
it
was
peter
dragging
his
quilt
behind
him
like
the
tail
of
a
white
peacock
we
have
been
patient
he
said
and
i
had
to
bite
my
tongue
not
to
go
to
sleep
and
i
just
nearly
went
to
sleep
and
i
bit
too
hard

voice
that

the
others

as
long
as

said
phil
and
bobbie
got
her
arms
round
mother
waist
and
snuggled
close
to
her
well
it
a
story
long
enough
to
make
a
whole
book
of
he
a
writer
he
written
beautiful
books
in
russia
at
the
time
of
the
czar
one
dared

rich
people

things

wrong
said
mother
yes
so
in
england
but
in
russia
it
was
different
and
he
wrote
a
beautiful
book
about
poor
people
and
how
to
help
them
i
read
it
nothing
in
it
but
goodness
and
kindness
and
they
sent
him
to
prison
for
it
he
was
three
years
in
a
horrible
dungeon
with
hardly
any
light
and
all
damp
and
dreadful
in
prison
all
alone
for
three
mother
voice
trembled
a
little
and
stopped
suddenly
but
mother
said
peter
that
ca
be
true
now
it
sounds
like
something
out
of
a
history
book
the
inquisition
or
it
was
true
said
mother
it
all
horribly
true
well
then
they
took
him
out
and
sent
him
to
siberia
a
convict
chained
to
other
convicts
wicked
men
who
done
all
sorts
of
crimes
a
long
chain
of
them
and
they
walked
and
walked
and
walked
for
days
and
weeks
till
he
thought
they
never
stop
walking
and
overseers
went
behind
them
with
whips
yes
whips
to
beat
them
if
they
got
tired
and
some
of
them
went
lame
and
some
fell
down
and
when
they
could
get
up
and
go
on
they
beat
them
and
then
left
them
to
die
oh
it
all
too
terrible
and
at
last
he
got
to
the
mines
and
he
was
condemned
to
stay
there
for
life
for
life
just
for
writing
a
good
noble
splendid
how
did
he
get
away
when
the
war
came
some
of
the
russian
prisoners
were
allowed
to
volunteer
as
soldiers
and
he
volunteered
but
he
deserted
at
the
first
chance
he
got
and
but
that
very
cowardly
is
it
said
peter
to
desert
especially
when
it
do
you
think
he
owed
anything
to
a
country
that
had
done
that
to
him
if
he
did
he
owed
more
to
his
wife
and
children
he
did
know
what
had
become
of
oh
cried
bobbie
he
had
them
to
think
about
and
be
miserable
about
too
then
all
the
time
he
was
in
prison
yes
he
had
them
to
think
about
and
be
miserable
about
all
the
time
he
was
in
prison
for
anything
he
knew
they
might
have
been
sent
to
prison
too
they
did
those
things
in
russia
but
while
he
was
in
the
mines
some
friends
managed
to
get
a
message
to
him
that
his
wife
and
children
had
escaped
and
come
to
england
so
when
he
deserted
he
came
here
to
look
for
had
he
got
their
address
said
practical
peter
no
just
england
he
was
going
to
london
and
he
thought
he
had
to
change
at
our
station
and
then
he
found
he
lost
his
ticket
and
his
oh
do
you
think
he
find
them
i
mean
his
wife
and
children
not
the
ticket
and
i
hope
so
oh
i
hope
and
pray
that
he
find
his
wife
and
children
even
phyllis
now
perceived
that
mother
voice
was
very
unsteady
why
mother
she
said
how
very
sorry
you
seem
to
be
for
him
mother
did
answer
for
a
minute
then
she
just
said
yes
and
then
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
the
children
were
quiet
presently
she
said
dears
when
you
say
your
prayers
i
think
you
might
ask
god
to
show
his
pity
upon
all
prisoners
and
to
show
his
pity
bobbie
repeated
slowly
upon
all
prisoners
and
captives
is
that
right
mother
yes
said
mother
upon
all
prisoners
and
captives
all
prisoners
and
chapter
vi
saviours
of
the
train
the
russian
gentleman
was
better
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
that
better
still
and
on
the
third
day
he
was
well
enough
to
come
into
the
garden
a
basket
chair
was
put
for
him
and
he
sat
there
dressed
in
clothes
of
father
which
were
too
big
for
him
but
when
mother
had
hemmed
up
the
ends
of
the
sleeves
and
the
trousers
the
clothes
did
well
enough
his
was
a
kind
face
now
that
it
was
no
longer
tired
and
frightened
and
he
smiled
at
the
children
whenever
he
saw
them
they
wished
very
much
that
he
could
speak
english
mother
wrote
several
letters
to
people
she
thought
might
know
whereabouts
in
england
a
russian
gentleman
wife
and
family
might
possibly
be
not
to
the
people
she
used
to
know
before
she
came
to
live
at
three
chimneys
she
never
wrote
to
any
of
them
but
strange
people
members
of
parliament
and
editors
of
papers
and
secretaries
of
societies
and
she
did
not
do
much
of
her
only
corrected
proofs
as
she
sat
in
the
sun
near
the
russian
and
talked
to
him
every
now
and
then
the
children
wanted
very
much
to
show
how
kindly
they
felt
to
this
man
who
had
been
sent
to
prison
and
to
siberia
just
for
writing
a
beautiful
book
about
poor
people
they
could
smile
at
him
of
course
they
could
and
they
did
but
if
you
smile
too
constantly
the
smile
is
apt
to
get
fixed
like
the
smile
of
the
hyaena
and
then
it
no
longer
looks
friendly
but
simply
silly
so
they
tried
other
ways
and
brought
him
flowers
till
the
place
where
he
sat
was
surrounded
by
little
fading
bunches
of
clover
and
roses
and
canterbury
bells
and
then
phyllis
had
an
idea
she
beckoned
mysteriously
to
the
others
and
drew
them
into
the
back
yard
and
there
in
a
concealed
spot
between
the
pump
and
the
she
said
you
remember
perks
promising
me
the
very
first
strawberries
out
of
his
own
garden
perks
you
will
recollect
was
the
porter
well
i
should
think
they
ripe
now
let
go
down
and
mother
had
been
down
as
she
had
promised
to
tell
the
station
master
the
story
of
the
russian
prisoner
but
even
the
charms
of
the
railway
had
been
unable
to
tear
the
children
away
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
interesting
stranger
so
they
had
not
been
to
the
station
for
three
days
they
went
now
and
to
their
surprise
and
distress
were
very
coldly
received
by
perks
honoured
i
sure
he
said
when
they
peeped
in
at
the
door
of
the
porters
room
and
he
went
on
reading
his
newspaper
there
was
an
uncomfortable
silence
oh
dear
said
bobbie
with
a
sigh
i
do
believe
you
what
me
not
me
said
perks
loftily
it
ai
nothing
to
what
ai
nothing
to
you
said
peter
too
anxious
and
alarmed
to
change
the
form
of
words
nothing
ai
nothing
what
either
or
elsewhere
said
perks
if
you
likes
to
your
secrets
and
welcome
what
i
the
of
each
heart
was
rapidly
examined
during
the
pause
that
followed
three
heads
were
shaken
we
have
got
any
secrets
from
you
said
bobbie
at
last
maybe
you
and
maybe
you
said
perks
it
ai
nothing
to
me
and
i
wish
you
all
a
very
good
he
held
up
the
paper
between
him
and
them
and
went
on
reading
oh
do
said
phyllis
in
despair
this
is
truly
dreadful
whatever
it
is
do
tell
we
did
mean
to
do
it
whatever
it
no
answer
the
paper
was
refolded
and
perks
began
on
another
column
look
here
said
peter
suddenly
it
not
fair
even
people
who
do
crimes
are
punished
without
being
told
what
it
for
as
once
they
were
in
i
do
know
nothing
about
oh
yes
you
do
when
mother
came
down
on
purpose
to
tell
you
and
gills
all
about
our
ca
you
fancy
it
said
perks
indignantly
do
you
see
of
me
to
step
into
room
and
take
a
chair
and
listen
to
what
ladyship
to
say
do
you
mean
to
say
you
not
heard
not
so
much
as
a
breath
i
did
go
so
far
as
to
put
a
question
and
he
shuts
me
up
like
a
of
state
perks
says
he
but
i
did
think
one
o
you
would
nipped
down
to
tell
me
you
here
sharp
enough
when
you
want
to
get
anything
out
of
old
perks
phyllis
flushed
purple
as
she
thought
of
the
strawberries
information
about
locomotives
or
signals
or
the
likes
said
perks
we
did
know
you
did
we
thought
mother
had
told
the
three
spoke
all
at
once
perks
said
it
was
all
very
well
and
still
held
up
the
paper
then
phyllis
suddenly
snatched
it
away
and
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
oh
let
kiss
and
be
friends
she
said
we
say
we
sorry
first
if
you
like
but
we
did
really
know
that
you
did
we
are
so
sorry
said
the
others
and
perks
at
last
consented
to
accept
their
apologies
then
they
got
him
to
come
out
and
sit
in
the
sun
on
the
green
railway
bank
where
the
grass
was
quite
hot
to
touch
and
there
sometimes
speaking
one
at
a
time
and
sometimes
all
together
they
told
the
porter
the
story
of
the
russian
prisoner
well
i
must
say
said
perks
but
he
did
not
say
it
whatever
it
was
yes
it
is
pretty
awful
is
it
said
peter
and
i
do
wonder
you
were
curious
about
who
the
russian
i
was
curious
not
so
much
as
interested
said
the
porter
well
i
do
think
gills
might
have
told
you
about
it
it
was
horrid
of
i
do
keep
no
down
on
for
that
missie
said
the
porter
cos
why
i
see
reasons
would
want
to
give
away
own
side
with
a
tale
like
that
it
ai
human
nature
a
man
got
to
stand
up
for
his
own
side
whatever
they
does
that
what
it
means
by
party
politics
i
should
done
the
same
myself
if
that
chap
been
a
but
the
japs
did
do
cruel
wicked
things
like
that
said
bobbie
not
said
perks
cautiously
still
you
ca
be
sure
with
foreigners
my
own
belief
is
they
all
tarred
with
the
same
then
why
were
you
on
the
side
of
the
japs
peter
asked
well
you
see
you
must
take
one
side
or
the
other
same
as
with
liberals
and
conservatives
the
great
thing
is
to
take
your
side
and
then
stick
to
it
whatever
a
signal
sounded
there
the
up
said
perks
you
lie
low
till
she
through
and
then
we
go
up
along
to
my
place
and
see
if
there
any
of
them
strawberries
ripe
what
i
told
you
if
there
are
any
ripe
and
you
do
give
them
to
me
said
phyllis
you
wo
mind
if
i
give
them
to
the
poor
russian
will
you
perks
narrowed
his
eyes
and
then
raised
his
eyebrows
so
it
was
them
strawberries
you
come
down
for
this
afternoon
eh
said
he
this
was
an
awkward
moment
for
phyllis
to
say
yes
would
seem
rude
and
greedy
and
unkind
to
perks
but
she
knew
if
she
said
no
she
would
not
be
pleased
with
herself
afterwards
so
yes
she
said
it
well
done
said
the
porter
speak
the
truth
and
shame
the
but
we
have
come
down
the
very
next
day
if
we
known
you
heard
the
story
phyllis
added
hastily
i
believe
you
missie
said
perks
and
sprang
across
the
line
six
feet
in
front
of
the
advancing
train
the
girls
hated
to
see
him
do
this
but
peter
liked
it
it
was
so
exciting
the
russian
gentleman
was
so
delighted
with
the
strawberries
that
the
three
racked
their
brains
to
find
some
other
surprise
for
him
but
all
the
racking
did
not
bring
out
any
idea
more
novel
than
wild
cherries
and
this
idea
occurred
to
them
next
morning
they
had
seen
the
blossom
on
the
trees
in
the
spring
and
they
knew
where
to
look
for
wild
cherries
now
that
cherry
time
was
here
the
trees
grew
all
up
and
along
the
rocky
face
of
the
cliff
out
of
which
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
opened
there
were
all
sorts
of
trees
there
birches
and
beeches
and
baby
oaks
and
hazels
and
among
them
the
cherry
blossom
had
shone
like
snow
and
silver
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
was
some
way
from
three
chimneys
so
mother
let
them
take
their
lunch
with
them
in
a
basket
and
the
basket
would
do
to
bring
the
cherries
back
in
if
they
found
any
she
also
lent
them
her
silver
watch
so
that
they
should
not
be
late
for
tea
peter
waterbury
had
taken
it
into
its
head
not
to
go
since
the
day
when
peter
dropped
it
into
the
and
they
started
when
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
cutting
they
leaned
over
the
fence
and
looked
down
to
where
the
railway
lines
lay
at
the
bottom
of
what
as
phyllis
said
was
exactly
like
a
mountain
gorge
if
it
was
for
the
railway
at
the
bottom
it
would
be
as
though
the
foot
of
man
had
never
been
there
would
it
the
sides
of
the
cutting
were
of
grey
stone
very
roughly
hewn
indeed
the
top
part
of
the
cutting
had
been
a
little
natural
glen
that
had
been
cut
deeper
to
bring
it
down
to
the
level
of
the
tunnel
mouth
among
the
rocks
grass
and
flowers
grew
and
seeds
dropped
by
birds
in
the
crannies
of
the
stone
had
taken
root
and
grown
into
bushes
and
trees
that
overhung
the
cutting
near
the
tunnel
was
a
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
the
line
just
wooden
bars
roughly
fixed
into
the
earth
a
very
steep
and
narrow
way
more
like
a
ladder
than
a
stair
we
better
get
down
said
peter
i
sure
the
cherries
would
be
quite
easy
to
get
at
from
the
side
of
the
steps
you
remember
it
was
there
we
picked
the
cherry
blossoms
that
we
put
on
the
rabbit
so
they
went
along
the
fence
towards
the
little
swing
gate
that
is
at
the
top
of
these
steps
and
they
were
almost
at
the
gate
when
bobbie
said
hush
stop
what
that
that
was
a
very
odd
noise
indeed
a
soft
noise
but
quite
plainly
to
be
heard
through
the
sound
of
the
wind
in
tree
branches
and
the
hum
and
whir
of
the
telegraph
wires
it
was
a
sort
of
rustling
whispering
sound
as
they
listened
it
stopped
and
then
it
began
again
and
this
time
it
did
not
stop
but
it
grew
louder
and
more
rustling
and
rumbling
look
cried
peter
suddenly
the
tree
over
there
the
tree
he
pointed
at
was
one
of
those
that
have
rough
grey
leaves
and
white
flowers
the
berries
when
they
come
are
bright
scarlet
but
if
you
pick
them
they
disappoint
you
by
turning
black
before
you
get
them
home
and
as
peter
pointed
the
tree
was
moving
not
just
the
way
trees
ought
to
move
when
the
wind
blows
through
them
but
all
in
one
piece
as
though
it
were
a
live
creature
and
were
walking
down
the
side
of
the
cutting
it
moving
cried
bobbie
oh
look
and
so
are
the
others
it
like
the
woods
in
it
magic
said
phyllis
breathlessly
i
always
knew
this
railway
was
it
really
did
seem
a
little
like
magic
for
all
the
trees
for
about
twenty
yards
of
the
opposite
bank
seemed
to
be
slowly
walking
down
towards
the
railway
line
the
tree
with
the
grey
leaves
bringing
up
the
rear
like
some
old
shepherd
driving
a
flock
of
green
sheep
what
is
it
oh
what
is
it
said
phyllis
it
much
too
magic
for
me
i
do
like
it
let
go
but
bobbie
and
peter
clung
fast
to
the
rail
and
watched
breathlessly
and
phyllis
made
no
movement
towards
going
home
by
herself
the
trees
moved
on
and
on
some
stones
and
loose
earth
fell
down
and
rattled
on
the
railway
metals
far
below
it
all
coming
down
peter
tried
to
say
but
he
found
there
was
hardly
any
voice
to
say
it
with
and
indeed
just
as
he
spoke
the
great
rock
on
the
top
of
which
the
walking
trees
were
leaned
slowly
forward
the
trees
ceasing
to
walk
stood
still
and
shivered
leaning
with
the
rock
they
seemed
to
hesitate
a
moment
and
then
rock
and
trees
and
grass
and
bushes
with
a
rushing
sound
slipped
right
away
from
the
face
of
the
cutting
and
fell
on
the
line
with
a
blundering
crash
that
could
have
been
heard
half
a
mile
off
a
cloud
of
dust
rose
up
oh
said
peter
in
awestruck
tones
is
it
exactly
like
when
coals
come
in
if
there
was
any
roof
to
the
cellar
and
you
could
see
look
what
a
great
mound
it
made
said
bobbie
yes
said
peter
slowly
he
was
still
leaning
on
the
fence
yes
he
said
again
still
more
slowly
then
he
stood
upright
the
down
has
gone
by
yet
we
must
let
them
know
at
the
station
or
there
be
a
most
frightful
let
run
said
bobbie
and
began
but
peter
cried
come
back
and
looked
at
mother
watch
he
was
very
prompt
and
businesslike
and
his
face
looked
whiter
than
they
had
ever
seen
it
no
time
he
said
it
two
miles
away
and
it
past
could
we
suggested
phyllis
breathlessly
could
we
climb
up
a
telegraph
post
and
do
something
to
the
wires
we
do
know
how
said
peter
they
do
it
in
war
said
phyllis
i
know
i
heard
of
they
only
cut
them
silly
said
peter
and
that
does
do
any
good
and
we
could
cut
them
even
if
we
got
up
and
we
could
get
up
if
we
had
anything
red
we
could
get
down
on
the
line
and
wave
but
the
train
would
see
us
till
it
got
round
the
corner
and
then
it
could
see
the
mound
just
as
well
as
us
said
phyllis
better
because
it
much
bigger
than
if
we
only
had
something
red
peter
repeated
we
could
go
round
the
corner
and
wave
to
the
we
might
wave
they
only
think
it
was
just
us
as
usual
we
waved
so
often
before
anyway
let
get
they
got
down
the
steep
stairs
bobbie
was
pale
and
shivering
face
looked
thinner
than
usual
phyllis
was
and
damp
with
anxiety
oh
how
hot
i
am
she
said
and
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
cold
i
wish
we
had
put
on
our
she
stopped
short
and
then
ended
in
quite
a
different
tone
our
flannel
bobbie
turned
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
oh
yes
she
cried
they
red
let
take
them
they
did
and
with
the
petticoats
rolled
up
under
their
arms
ran
along
the
railway
skirting
the
newly
fallen
mound
of
stones
and
rock
and
earth
and
bent
crushed
twisted
trees
they
ran
at
their
best
pace
peter
led
but
the
girls
were
not
far
behind
they
reached
the
corner
that
hid
the
mound
from
the
straight
line
of
railway
that
ran
half
a
mile
without
curve
or
corner
now
said
peter
taking
hold
of
the
largest
flannel
petticoat
you
not
phyllis
faltered
you
not
going
to
tear
them
shut
up
said
peter
with
brief
sternness
oh
yes
said
bobbie
tear
them
into
little
bits
if
you
like
you
see
phil
if
we
ca
stop
the
train
there
be
a
real
live
accident
with
people
killed
oh
horrible
here
peter
you
never
tear
it
through
the
band
she
took
the
red
flannel
petticoat
from
him
and
tore
it
off
an
inch
from
the
band
then
she
tore
the
other
in
the
same
way
there
said
peter
tearing
in
his
turn
he
divided
each
petticoat
into
three
pieces
now
we
got
six
he
looked
at
the
watch
again
and
we
got
seven
minutes
we
must
have
the
knives
given
to
boys
are
for
some
odd
reason
seldom
of
the
kind
of
steel
that
keeps
sharp
the
young
saplings
had
to
be
broken
off
two
came
up
by
the
roots
the
leaves
were
stripped
from
them
we
must
cut
holes
in
the
flags
and
run
the
sticks
through
the
holes
said
peter
and
the
holes
were
cut
the
knife
was
sharp
enough
to
cut
flannel
with
two
of
the
flags
were
set
up
in
heaps
of
loose
stones
between
the
sleepers
of
the
down
line
then
phyllis
and
roberta
took
each
a
flag
and
stood
ready
to
wave
it
as
soon
as
the
train
came
in
sight
i
shall
have
the
other
two
myself
said
peter
because
it
was
my
idea
to
wave
something
they
our
petticoats
though
phyllis
was
beginning
but
bobbie
interrupted
oh
what
does
it
matter
who
waves
what
if
we
can
only
save
the
train
perhaps
peter
had
not
rightly
calculated
the
number
of
minutes
it
would
take
the
to
get
from
the
station
to
the
place
where
they
were
or
perhaps
the
train
was
late
anyway
it
seemed
a
very
long
time
that
they
waited
phyllis
grew
impatient
i
expect
the
watch
is
wrong
and
the
gone
by
said
she
peter
relaxed
the
heroic
attitude
he
had
chosen
to
show
off
his
two
flags
and
bobbie
began
to
feel
sick
with
suspense
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
had
been
standing
there
for
hours
and
hours
holding
those
silly
little
red
flannel
flags
that
no
one
would
ever
notice
the
train
would
care
it
would
go
rushing
by
them
and
tear
round
the
corner
and
go
crashing
into
that
awful
mound
and
everyone
would
be
killed
her
hands
grew
very
cold
and
trembled
so
that
she
could
hardly
hold
the
flag
and
then
came
the
distant
rumble
and
hum
of
the
metals
and
a
puff
of
white
steam
showed
far
away
along
the
stretch
of
line
stand
firm
said
peter
and
wave
like
mad
when
it
gets
to
that
big
furze
bush
step
back
but
go
on
waving
do
stand
on
the
line
bobbie
the
train
came
rattling
along
very
very
fast
they
do
see
us
they
wo
see
us
it
all
no
good
cried
bobbie
the
two
little
flags
on
the
line
swayed
as
the
nearing
train
shook
and
loosened
the
heaps
of
loose
stones
that
held
them
up
one
of
them
slowly
leaned
over
and
fell
on
the
line
bobbie
jumped
forward
and
caught
it
up
and
waved
it
her
hands
did
not
tremble
now
it
seemed
that
the
train
came
on
as
fast
as
ever
it
was
very
near
now
keep
off
the
line
you
silly
cuckoo
said
peter
fiercely
it
no
good
bobbie
said
again
stand
back
cried
peter
suddenly
and
he
dragged
phyllis
back
by
the
arm
but
bobbie
cried
not
yet
not
yet
and
waved
her
two
flags
right
over
the
line
the
front
of
the
engine
looked
black
and
enormous
its
voice
was
loud
and
harsh
oh
stop
stop
stop
cried
bobbie
no
one
heard
her
at
least
peter
and
phyllis
did
for
the
oncoming
rush
of
the
train
covered
the
sound
of
her
voice
with
a
mountain
of
sound
but
afterwards
she
used
to
wonder
whether
the
engine
itself
had
not
heard
her
it
seemed
almost
as
though
it
had
for
it
slackened
swiftly
slackened
and
stopped
not
twenty
yards
from
the
place
where
bobbie
two
flags
waved
over
the
line
she
saw
the
great
black
engine
stop
dead
but
somehow
she
could
not
stop
waving
the
flags
and
when
the
driver
and
the
fireman
had
got
off
the
engine
and
peter
and
phyllis
had
gone
to
meet
them
and
pour
out
their
excited
tale
of
the
awful
mound
just
round
the
corner
bobbie
still
waved
the
flags
but
more
and
more
feebly
and
jerkily
when
the
others
turned
towards
her
she
was
lying
across
the
line
with
her
hands
flung
forward
and
still
gripping
the
sticks
of
the
little
red
flannel
flags
the
picked
her
up
carried
her
to
the
train
and
laid
her
on
the
cushions
of
a
carriage
gone
right
off
in
a
faint
he
said
poor
little
woman
and
no
wonder
i
just
a
look
at
this
mound
of
yours
and
then
we
run
you
back
to
the
station
and
get
her
seen
it
was
horrible
to
see
bobbie
lying
so
white
and
quiet
with
her
lips
blue
and
parted
i
believe
that
what
people
look
like
when
they
dead
whispered
phyllis
do
said
peter
sharply
they
sat
by
bobbie
on
the
blue
cushions
and
the
train
ran
back
before
it
reached
their
station
bobbie
had
sighed
and
opened
her
eyes
and
rolled
herself
over
and
begun
to
cry
this
cheered
the
others
wonderfully
they
had
seen
her
cry
before
but
they
had
never
seen
her
faint
nor
anyone
else
for
the
matter
of
that
they
had
not
known
what
to
do
when
she
was
fainting
but
now
she
was
only
crying
they
could
thump
her
on
the
back
and
tell
her
not
to
just
as
they
always
did
and
presently
when
she
stopped
crying
they
were
able
to
laugh
at
her
for
being
such
a
coward
as
to
faint
when
the
station
was
reached
the
three
were
the
heroes
of
an
agitated
meeting
on
the
platform
the
praises
they
got
for
their
prompt
action
their
common
sense
their
ingenuity
were
enough
to
have
turned
anybody
head
phyllis
enjoyed
herself
thoroughly
she
had
never
been
a
real
heroine
before
and
the
feeling
was
delicious
peter
ears
got
very
red
yet
he
too
enjoyed
himself
only
bobbie
wished
they
all
would
she
wanted
to
get
away
you
hear
from
the
company
about
this
i
expect
said
the
station
master
bobbie
wished
she
might
never
hear
of
it
again
she
pulled
at
jacket
oh
come
away
come
away
i
want
to
go
home
she
said
so
they
went
and
as
they
went
station
master
and
porter
and
guards
and
driver
and
fireman
and
passengers
sent
up
a
cheer
oh
listen
cried
phyllis
that
for
us
yes
said
peter
i
say
i
am
glad
i
thought
about
something
red
and
waving
how
lucky
we
did
put
on
our
red
flannel
petticoats
said
phyllis
bobbie
said
nothing
she
was
thinking
of
the
horrible
mound
and
the
trustful
train
rushing
towards
it
and
it
was
us
that
saved
them
said
peter
how
dreadful
if
they
had
all
been
killed
said
phyllis
would
it
bobbie
we
never
got
any
cherries
after
all
said
bobbie
the
others
thought
her
rather
heartless
chapter
vii
for
valour
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
telling
you
a
good
deal
about
roberta
the
fact
is
i
am
growing
very
fond
of
her
the
more
i
observe
her
the
more
i
love
her
and
i
notice
all
sorts
of
things
about
her
that
i
like
for
instance
she
was
quite
oddly
anxious
to
make
other
people
happy
and
she
could
keep
a
secret
a
tolerably
rare
accomplishment
also
she
had
the
power
of
silent
sympathy
that
sounds
rather
dull
i
know
but
it
not
so
dull
as
it
sounds
it
just
means
that
a
person
is
able
to
know
that
you
are
unhappy
and
to
love
you
extra
on
that
account
without
bothering
you
by
telling
you
all
the
time
how
sorry
she
is
for
you
that
was
what
bobbie
was
like
she
knew
that
mother
was
unhappy
and
that
mother
had
not
told
her
the
reason
so
she
just
loved
mother
more
and
never
said
a
single
word
that
could
let
mother
know
how
earnestly
her
little
girl
wondered
what
mother
was
unhappy
about
this
needs
practice
it
is
not
so
easy
as
you
might
think
whatever
happened
and
all
sorts
of
nice
pleasant
ordinary
things
happened
such
as
picnics
games
and
buns
for
tea
bobbie
always
had
these
thoughts
at
the
back
of
her
mind
mother
unhappy
why
i
know
she
does
want
me
to
know
i
wo
try
to
find
out
but
she
is
unhappy
why
i
do
know
she
does
and
so
on
repeating
and
repeating
like
a
tune
that
you
do
know
the
stopping
part
of
the
russian
gentleman
still
took
up
a
good
deal
of
everybody
thoughts
all
the
editors
and
secretaries
of
societies
and
members
of
parliament
had
answered
mother
letters
as
politely
as
they
knew
how
but
none
of
them
could
tell
where
the
wife
and
children
of
szezcpansky
would
be
likely
to
be
did
i
tell
you
that
the
russian
very
russian
name
was
that
bobbie
had
another
quality
which
you
will
hear
differently
described
by
different
people
some
of
them
call
it
interfering
in
other
business
and
some
call
it
helping
lame
dogs
over
stiles
and
some
call
it
it
just
means
trying
to
help
people
she
racked
her
brains
to
think
of
some
way
of
helping
the
russian
gentleman
to
find
his
wife
and
children
he
had
learned
a
few
words
of
english
now
he
could
say
good
morning
and
good
night
and
please
and
thank
you
and
pretty
when
the
children
brought
him
flowers
and
ver
good
when
they
asked
him
how
he
had
slept
the
way
he
smiled
when
he
said
his
english
was
bobbie
felt
just
too
sweet
for
she
used
to
think
of
his
face
because
she
fancied
it
would
help
her
to
some
way
of
helping
him
but
it
did
not
yet
his
being
there
cheered
her
because
she
saw
that
it
made
mother
happier
she
likes
to
have
someone
to
be
good
to
even
beside
us
said
bobbie
and
i
know
she
hated
to
let
him
have
father
clothes
but
i
suppose
it
nice
or
she
would
for
many
and
many
a
night
after
the
day
when
she
and
peter
and
phyllis
had
saved
the
train
from
wreck
by
waving
their
little
red
flannel
flags
bobbie
used
to
wake
screaming
and
shivering
seeing
again
that
horrible
mound
and
the
poor
dear
trustful
engine
rushing
on
towards
it
just
thinking
that
it
was
doing
its
swift
duty
and
that
everything
was
clear
and
safe
and
then
a
warm
thrill
of
pleasure
used
to
run
through
her
at
the
remembrance
of
how
she
and
peter
and
phyllis
and
the
red
flannel
petticoats
had
really
saved
everybody
one
morning
a
letter
came
it
was
addressed
to
peter
and
bobbie
and
phyllis
they
opened
it
with
enthusiastic
curiosity
for
they
did
not
often
get
letters
the
letter
said
dear
sir
and
ladies
it
is
proposed
to
make
a
small
presentation
to
you
in
commemoration
of
your
prompt
and
courageous
action
in
warning
the
train
on
the
and
thus
averting
what
must
humanly
speaking
have
been
a
terrible
accident
the
presentation
will
take
place
at
the
station
at
three
on
the
if
this
time
and
place
will
be
convenient
to
you
yours
faithfully
jabez
inglewood
secretary
great
northern
and
southern
railway
there
never
had
been
a
prouder
moment
in
the
lives
of
the
three
children
they
rushed
to
mother
with
the
letter
and
she
also
felt
proud
and
said
so
and
this
made
the
children
happier
than
ever
but
if
the
presentation
is
money
you
must
say
you
but
rather
not
take
it
said
mother
i
wash
your
indian
muslins
at
once
she
added
you
must
look
tidy
on
an
occasion
like
phil
and
i
can
wash
them
said
bobbie
if
you
iron
them
washing
is
rather
fun
i
wonder
whether
you
ever
done
it
this
particular
washing
took
place
in
the
back
kitchen
which
had
a
stone
floor
and
a
very
big
stone
sink
under
its
window
let
put
the
bath
on
the
sink
said
phyllis
then
we
can
pretend
we
washerwomen
like
mother
saw
in
but
they
were
washing
in
the
cold
river
said
peter
his
hands
in
his
pockets
not
in
hot
this
is
a
hot
river
then
said
phyllis
lend
a
hand
with
the
bath
there
a
i
should
like
to
see
a
deer
lending
a
hand
said
peter
but
he
lent
his
now
to
rub
and
scrub
and
scrub
and
rub
said
phyllis
hopping
joyously
about
as
bobbie
carefully
carried
the
heavy
kettle
from
the
kitchen
fire
oh
no
said
bobbie
greatly
shocked
you
do
rub
muslin
you
put
the
boiled
soap
in
the
hot
water
and
make
it
all
and
then
you
shake
the
muslin
and
squeeze
it
ever
so
gently
and
all
the
dirt
comes
out
it
only
clumsy
things
like
tablecloths
and
sheets
that
have
to
be
the
lilac
and
the
gloire
de
dijon
roses
outside
the
window
swayed
in
the
soft
breeze
it
a
nice
drying
day
that
one
thing
said
bobbie
feeling
very
grown
up
oh
i
do
wonder
what
wonderful
feelings
we
shall
have
when
we
wear
the
indian
muslin
dresses
yes
so
do
i
said
phyllis
shaking
and
squeezing
the
muslin
in
quite
a
professional
manner
now
we
squeeze
out
the
soapy
water
no
we
must
twist
them
and
then
rinse
them
i
hold
them
while
you
and
peter
empty
the
bath
and
get
clean
a
presentation
that

said
peter
as
his
sisters
having
duly
washed
the
pegs
and
wiped
the
line
hung
up
the
dresses
to
dry
whatever
will
it
be
it
might
be
anything
said
phyllis
what
i
always
wanted
is
a
baby
elephant
but
i
suppose
they
would
know
suppose
it
was
gold
models
of
said
bobbie
or
a
big
model
of
the
scene
of
the
prevented
accident
suggested
peter
with
a
little
model
train
and
dolls
dressed
like
us
and
the
and
fireman
and
do
you
like
said
bobbie
doubtfully
drying
her
hands
on
the
rough
towel
that
hung
on
a
roller
at
the
back
of
the
scullery
door
do
you
like
us
being
rewarded
for
saving
a
train
yes
i
do
said
peter
downrightly
and
do
you
try
to
come
it
over
us
that
you
do
like
it
too
because
i
know
you
yes
said
bobbie
doubtfully
i
know
i
do
but
ought
we
to
be
satisfied
with
just
having
done
it
and
not
ask
for
anything
more
who
did
ask
for
anything
more
silly
said
her
brother
victoria
cross
soldiers
do
ask
for
it
but
they
glad
enough
to
get
it
all
the
same
perhaps
it

medals
then
when
i
very
old
indeed
i
shall
show
them
to
my
grandchildren
and
say
only
did
our
duty
and
they
be
awfully
proud
of
you
have
to
be
married
warned
phyllis
or
you
do
have
any
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
be
married
some
day
said
peter
but
it
will
be
an
awful
bother
having
her
round
all
the
time
i
like
to
marry
a
lady
who
had
trances
and
only
woke
up
once
or
twice
a
just
to
say
you
were
the
light
of
her
life
and
then
go
to
sleep
again
yes
that
would
be
bad
said
bobbie
when
get
married
said
phyllis
i
shall
want
him
to
want
me
to
be
awake
all
the
time
so
that
i
can
hear
him
say
how
nice
i
i
think
it
would
be
nice
said
bobbie
to
marry
someone
very
poor
and
then
you
do
all
the
work
and
he
love
you
most
frightfully
and
see
the
blue
wood
smoke
curling
up
among
the
trees
from
the
domestic
hearth
as
he
came
home
from
work
every
night
i
say
we
got
to
answer
that
letter
and
say
that
the
time
and
place
will
be
convenient
to
us
there
the
soap
peter
we
both
as
clean
as
clean
that
pink
box
of
writing
paper
you
had
on
your
birthday
it
took
some
time
to
arrange
what
should
be
said
mother
had
gone
back
to
her
writing
and
several
sheets
of
pink
paper
with
scalloped
gilt
edges
and
green
shamrocks
in
the
corner
were
spoiled
before
the
three
had
decided
what
to
say
then
each
made
a
copy
and
signed
it
with
its
own
name
the
threefold
letter
ran
dear
jabez
inglewood
thank
you
very
much
we
did
not
want
to
be
rewarded
but
only
to
save
the
train
but
we
are
glad
you
think
so
and
thank
you
very
much
the
time
and
place
you
say
will
be
quite
convenient
to
us
thank
you
very
much
your
affecate
little
friend
then
came
the
name
and
after
it
thank
you
very
washing
is
much
easier
than
ironing
said
bobbie
taking
the
clean
dry
dresses
off
the
line
i
do
love
to
see
things
come
clean
oh
i
know
how
we
shall
wait
till
it
time
to
know
what
presentation
going
to
present
when
at
last
it
seemed
a
very
long
time
after
it
was
the
day
the
three
children
went
down
to
the
station
at
the
proper
time
and
everything
that
happened
was
so
odd
that
it
seemed
like
a
dream
the
station
master
came
out
to
meet
them
in
his
best
clothes
as
peter
noticed
at
once
and
led
them
into
the
waiting
room
where
once
they
had
played
the
advertisement
game
it
looked
quite
different
now
a
carpet
had
been
put
down
and
there
were
pots
of
roses
on
the
mantelpiece
and
on
the
window
ledges
green
branches
stuck
up
like
holly
and
laurel
are
at
christmas
over
the
framed
advertisement
of
cook
tours
and
the
beauties
of
devon
and
the
paris
lyons
railway
there
were
quite
a
number
of
people
there
besides
the
porter
two
or
three
ladies
in
smart
dresses
and
quite
a
crowd
of
gentlemen
in
high
hats
and
frock
coats
besides
everybody
who
belonged
to
the
station
they
recognized
several
people
who
had
been
in
the
train
on
the
day
best
of
all
their
own
old
gentleman
was
there
and
his
coat
and
hat
and
collar
seemed
more
than
ever
different
from
anyone
else
he
shook
hands
with
them
and
then
everybody
sat
down
on
chairs
and
a
gentleman
in
spectacles
they
found
out
afterwards
that
he
was
the
district
superintendent
began
quite
a
long
speech
very
clever
indeed
i
am
not
going
to
write
the
speech
down
first
because
you
would
think
it
dull
and
secondly
because
it
made
all
the
children
blush
so
and
get
so
hot
about
the
ears
that
i
am
quite
anxious
to
get
away
from
this
part
of
the
subject
and
thirdly
because
the
gentleman
took
so
many
words
to
say
what
he
had
to
say
that
i
really
have
time
to
write
them
down
he
said
all
sorts
of
nice
things
about
the
children
bravery
and
presence
of
mind
and
when
he
had
done
he
sat
down
and
everyone
who
was
there
clapped
and
said
hear
and
then
the
old
gentleman
got
up
and
said
things
too
it
was
very
like
a
and
then
he
called
the
children
one
by
one
by
their
names
and
gave
each
of
them
a
beautiful
gold
watch
and
chain
and
inside
the
watches
were
engraved
after
the
name
of
the
watch
new
owner
from
the
directors
of
the
northern
and
southern
railway
in
grateful
recognition
of
the
courageous
and
prompt
action
which
averted
an
accident
on
the
watches
were
the
most
beautiful
you
can
possibly
imagine
and
each
one
had
a
blue
leather
case
to
live
in
when
it
was
at
home
you
must
make
a
speech
now
and
thank
everyone
for
their
kindness
whispered
the
station
master
in
peter
ear
and
pushed
him
forward
begin
and
gentlemen
he
added
each
of
the
children
had
already
said
thank
you
quite
properly
oh
dear
said
peter
but
he
did
not
resist
the
push
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
rather
husky
voice
then
there
was
a
pause
and
he
heard
his
heart
beating
in
his
throat
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
went
on
with
a
rush
it
most
awfully
good
of
you
and
we
shall
treasure
the
watches
all
our
lives
but
really
we
do
deserve
it
because
what
we
did
was
anything
really
at
least
i
mean
it
was
awfully
exciting
and
what
i
mean
to
say
thank
you
all
very
very
the
people
clapped
peter
more
than
they
had
done
the
district
superintendent
and
then
everybody
shook
hands
with
them
and
as
soon
as
politeness
would
let
them
they
got
away
and
tore
up
the
hill
to
three
chimneys
with
their
watches
in
their
hands
it
was
a
wonderful
day
the
kind
of
day
that
very
seldom
happens
to
anybody
and
to
most
of
us
not
at
all
i
did
want
to
talk
to
the
old
gentleman
about
something
else
said
bobbie
but
it
was
so
public
like
being
in
what
did
you
want
to
say
asked
phyllis
i
tell
you
when
i
thought
about
it
more
said
bobbie
so
when
she
had
thought
a
little
more
she
wrote
a
letter
my
dearest
old
gentleman
it
said
i
want
most
awfully
to
ask
you
something
if
you
could
get
out
of
the
train
and
go
by
the
next
it
would
do
i
do
not
want
you
to
give
me
anything
mother
says
we
ought
not
to
and
besides
we
do
not
want
any
things
only
to
talk
to
you
about
a
prisoner
and
captive
your
loving
little
friend
she
got
the
station
master
to
give
the
letter
to
the
old
gentleman
and
next
day
she
asked
peter
and
phyllis
to
come
down
to
the
station
with
her
at
the
time
when
the
train
that
brought
the
old
gentleman
from
town
would
be
passing
through
she
explained
her
idea
to
them
and
they
approved
thoroughly
they
had
all
washed
their
hands
and
faces
and
brushed
their
hair
and
were
looking
as
tidy
as
they
knew
how
but
phyllis
always
unlucky
had
upset
a
jug
of
lemonade
down
the
front
of
her
dress
there
was
no
time
to
change
and
the
wind
happening
to
blow
from
the
coal
yard
her
frock
was
soon
powdered
with
grey
which
stuck
to
the
sticky
lemonade
stains
and
made
her
look
as
peter
said
like
any
little
gutter
it
was
decided
that
she
should
keep
behind
the
others
as
much
as
possible
perhaps
the
old
gentleman
wo
notice
said
bobbie
the
aged
are
often
weak
in
the
there
was
no
sign
of
weakness
however
in
the
eyes
or
in
any
other
part
of
the
old
gentleman
as
he
stepped
from
the
train
and
looked
up
and
down
the
platform
the
three
children
now
that
it
came
to
the
point
suddenly
felt
that
rush
of
deep
shyness
which
makes
your
ears
red
and
hot
your
hands
warm
and
wet
and
the
tip
of
your
nose
pink
and
shiny
oh
said
phyllis
my
heart
thumping
like
a
right
under
my
sash
nonsense
said
peter
people
hearts
are
under
their
i
do
care
mine
is
said
phyllis
if
you
going
to
talk
like
a
said
peter
my
heart
in
my
my
heart
in
my
boots
if
you
come
to
that
said
roberta
but
do
come
on
he
think
we
he
wo
be
far
wrong
said
peter
gloomily
and
they
went
forward
to
meet
the
old
gentleman
hullo
he
said
shaking
hands
with
them
all
in
turn
this
is
a
very
great
it
was
good
of
you
to
get
out
bobbie
said
perspiring
and
polite
he
took
her
arm
and
drew
her
into
the
waiting
room
where
she
and
the
others
had
played
the
advertisement
game
the
day
they
found
the
russian
phyllis
and
peter
followed
well
said
the
old
gentleman
giving
bobbie
arm
a
kind
little
shake
before
he
let
it
go
well
what
is
it
oh
please
said
bobbie
yes
said
the
old
gentleman
what
i
mean
to
say
said
bobbie
well
said
the
old
gentleman
it
all
very
nice
and
kind
said
she
but
he
said
i
wish
i
might
say
something
she
said
say
it
said
he
well
then
said
bobbie
and
out
came
the
story
of
the
russian
who
had
written
the
beautiful
book
about
poor
people
and
had
been
sent
to
prison
and
to
siberia
for
just
that
and
what
we
want
more
than
anything
in
the
world
is
to
find
his
wife
and
children
for
him
said
bobbie
but
we
do
know
how
but
you
must
be
most
horribly
clever
or
you
would
be
a
direction
of
the
railway
and
if
you
knew
how
and
would
we
rather
have
that
than
anything
else
in
the
world
we
go
without
the
watches
even
if
you
could
sell
them
and
find
his
wife
with
the
and
the
others
said
so
too
though
not
with
so
much
enthusiasm
hum
said
the
old
gentleman
pulling
down
the
white
waistcoat
that
had
the
big
gilt
buttons
on
it
what
did
you
say
the
name
was
fryingpansky
no
no
said
bobbie
earnestly
i
write
it
down
for
you
it
really
look
at
all
like
that
except
when
you
say
it
have
you
a
bit
of
pencil
and
the
back
of
an
envelope
she
asked
the
old
gentleman
got
out
a
gold
and
a
beautiful
green
russian
leather
and
opened
it
at
a
new
page
here
he
said
write
she
wrote
down
szezcpansky
and
said
that
how
you
write
it
you
call
it
the
old
gentleman
took
out
a
pair
of
spectacles
and
fitted
them
on
his
nose
when
he
had
read
the
name
he
looked
quite
different
that
man
bless
my
soul
he
said
why
i
read
his
book
translated
into
every
european
language
a
fine
book
a
noble
book
and
so
your
mother
took
him
in
like
the
good
samaritan
well
well
tell
you
what
youngsters
your
mother
must
be
a
very
good
of
course
she
is
said
phyllis
in
astonishment
and
you
a
very
good
man
said
bobbie
very
shy
but
firmly
resolved
to
be
polite
you
flatter
me
said
the
old
gentleman
taking
off
his
hat
with
a
flourish
and
now
am
i
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
oh
please
do
said
bobbie
hastily
why
asked
the
old
gentleman
i
do
exactly
know
said
bobbie
only
if
it
horrid
i
do
want
you
to
and
if
it
nice
i
rather
you
the
old
gentleman
laughed
well
then
he
said
i
only
just
say
that
i
very
glad
you
came
to
me
about
this
very
glad
indeed
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
i
found
out
something
very
soon
i
know
a
great
many
russians
in
london
and
every
russian
knows
his
name
now
tell
me
all
about
he
turned
to
the
others
but
there
was
only
one
other
and
that
was
peter
phyllis
had
disappeared
tell
me
all
about
yourself
said
the
old
gentleman
again
and
quite
naturally
peter
was
stricken
dumb
all
right
we
have
an
examination
said
the
old
gentleman
you
two
sit
on
the
table
and
i
sit
on
the
bench
and
ask
he
did
and
out
came
their
names
and
ages
their
father
name
and
business
how
long
they
had
lived
at
three
chimneys
and
a
great
deal
more
the
questions
were
beginning
to
turn
on
a
herring
and
a
half
for
three
halfpence
and
a
pound
of
lead
and
a
pound
of
feathers
when
the
door
of
the
waiting
room
was
kicked
open
by
a
boot
as
the
boot
entered
everyone
could
see
that
its
lace
was
coming
undone
and
in
came
phyllis
very
slowly
and
carefully
in
one
hand
she
carried
a
large
tin
can
and
in
the
other
a
thick
slice
of
bread
and
butter
afternoon
tea
she
announced
proudly
and
held
the
can
and
the
bread
and
butter
out
to
the
old
gentleman
who
took
them
and
said
bless
my
soul
yes
said
phyllis
it
very
thoughtful
of
you
said
the
old
gentleman
but
you
might
have
got
a
cup
said
bobbie
and
a
perks
always
drinks
out
of
the
can
said
phyllis
flushing
red
i
think
it
was
very
nice
of
him
to
give
it
me
at
all
let
alone
cups
and
plates
she
added
so
do
i
said
the
old
gentleman
and
he
drank
some
of
the
tea
and
tasted
the
bread
and
butter
and
then
it
was
time
for
the
next
train
and
he
got
into
it
with
many
and
kind
last
words
well
said
peter
when
they
were
left
on
the
platform
and
the
of
the
train
disappeared
round
the
corner
it
my
belief
that
we
lighted
a
candle
like
latimer
you
know
when
he
was
being
burned
and
there
be
fireworks
for
our
russian
before
and
so
there
were
it
was
ten
days
after
the
interview
in
the
waiting
room
that
the
three
children
were
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
biggest
rock
in
the
field
below
their
house
watching
the
steam
away
from
the
station
along
the
bottom
of
the
valley
they
saw
too
the
few
people
who
had
got
out
at
the
station
straggling
up
the
road
towards
the
village
and
they
saw
one
person
leave
the
road
and
open
the
gate
that
led
across
the
fields
to
three
chimneys
and
to
nowhere
else
who
on
earth
said
peter
scrambling
down
let
go
and
see
said
phyllis
so
they
did
and
when
they
got
near
enough
to
see
who
the
person
was
they
saw
it
was
their
old
gentleman
himself
his
brass
buttons
winking
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
and
his
white
waistcoat
looking
whiter
than
ever
against
the
green
of
the
field
hullo
shouted
the
children
waving
their
hands
hullo
shouted
the
old
gentleman
waving
his
hat
then
the
three
started
to
run
and
when
they
got
to
him
they
hardly
had
breath
left
to
say
how
do
you
do
good
news
said
he
i
found
your
russian
friend
wife
and
child
and
i
could
resist
the
temptation
of
giving
myself
the
pleasure
of
telling
but
as
he
looked
at
bobbie
face
he
felt
that
he
could
resist
that
temptation
here
he
said
to
her
you
run
on
and
tell
him
the
other
two
will
show
me
the
bobbie
ran
but
when
she
had
breathlessly
panted
out
the
news
to
the
russian
and
mother
sitting
in
the
quiet
garden
when
mother
face
had
lighted
up
so
beautifully
and
she
had
said
half
a
dozen
quick
french
words
to
the
exile
bobbie
wished
that
she
had
not
carried
the
news
for
the
russian
sprang
up
with
a
cry
that
made
bobbie
heart
leap
and
then
tremble
a
cry
of
love
and
longing
such
as
she
had
never
heard
then
he
took
mother
hand
and
kissed
it
gently
and
reverently
and
then
he
sank
down
in
his
chair
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
sobbed
bobbie
crept
away
she
did
not
want
to
see
the
others
just
then
but
she
was
as
gay
as
anybody
when
the
endless
french
talking
was
over
when
peter
had
torn
down
to
the
village
for
buns
and
cakes
and
the
girls
had
got
tea
ready
and
taken
it
out
into
the
garden
the
old
gentleman
was
most
merry
and
delightful
he
seemed
to
be
able
to
talk
in
french
and
english
almost
at
the
same
moment
and
mother
did
nearly
as
well
it
was
a
delightful
time
mother
seemed
as
if
she
could
not
make
enough
fuss
about
the
old
gentleman
and
she
said
yes
at
once
when
he
asked
if
he
might
present
some
goodies
to
his
little
friends
the
word
was
new
to
the
children
but
they
guessed
that
it
meant
sweets
for
the
three
large
pink
and
green
boxes
tied
with
green
ribbon
which
he
took
out
of
his
bag
held
layers
of
beautiful
chocolates
the
russian
few
belongings
were
packed
and
they
all
saw
him
off
at
the
station
then
mother
turned
to
the
old
gentleman
and
said
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
for
everything
it
has
been
a
real
pleasure
to
me
to
see
you
but
we
live
very
quietly
i
am
so
sorry
that
i
ca
ask
you
to
come
and
see
us
the
children
thought
this
very
hard
when
they
had
made
a
friend
and
such
a
friend
they
would
dearly
have
liked
him
to
come
and
see
them
again
what
the
old
gentleman
thought
they
could
tell
he
only
said
i
consider
myself
very
fortunate
madam
to
have
been
received
once
at
your
ah
said
mother
i
know
i
must
seem
surly
and
ungrateful
but
you
could
never
seem
anything
but
a
most
charming
and
gracious
lady
said
the
old
gentleman
with
another
of
his
bows
and
as
they
turned
to
go
up
the
hill
bobbie
saw
her
mother
face
how
tired
you
look
mammy
she
said
lean
on
it
my
place
to
give
mother
my
arm
said
peter
i
the
head
man
of
the
family
when
father
mother
took
an
arm
of
each
how
awfully
nice
said
phyllis
skipping
joyfully
to
think
of
the
dear
russian
embracing
his
wife
the
baby
must
have
grown
a
lot
since
he
saw
yes
said
mother
i
wonder
whether
father
will
think
i
grown
phyllis
went
on
skipping
still
more
gaily
i
have
grown
already
have
i
mother
yes
said
mother
oh
yes
and
bobbie
and
peter
felt
her
hands
tighten
on
their
arms
poor
old
mammy
you
are
tired
said
peter
bobbie
said
come
on
phil
i
race
you
to
the
and
she
started
the
race
though
she
hated
doing
it
you
know
why
bobbie
did
that
mother
only
thought
that
bobbie
was
tired
of
walking
slowly
even
mothers
who
love
you
better
than
anyone
else
ever
will
always
understand
chapter
viii
the
amateur
firemen
that
a
likely
little
brooch
you
got
on
miss
said
perks
the
porter
i
do
know
as
ever
i
see
a
thing
more
like
a
buttercup
without
it
was
a
yes
said
bobbie
glad
and
flushed
by
this
approval
i
always
thought
it
was
more
like
a
buttercup
almost
than
even
a
real
one
and
i
never
thought
it
would
come
to
be
mine
my
very
own
and
then
mother
gave
it
to
me
for
my
oh
have
you
had
a
birthday
said
perks
and
he
seemed
quite
surprised
as
though
a
birthday
were
a
thing
only
granted
to
a
favoured
few
yes
said
bobbie
when
your
birthday
mr
perks
the
children
were
taking
tea
with
mr
perks
in
the
porters
room
among
the
lamps
and
the
railway
almanacs
they
had
brought
their
own
cups
and
some
jam
turnovers
mr
perks
made
tea
in
a
beer
can
as
usual
and
everyone
felt
very
happy
and
confidential
my
birthday
said
perks
tipping
some
more
dark
brown
tea
out
of
the
can
into
peter
cup
i
give
up
keeping
of
my
birthday
afore
you
was
but
you
must
have
been
born
sometime
you
know
said
phyllis
thoughtfully
even
if
it
was
twenty
years
ago
or
thirty
or
sixty
or
not
so
long
as
that
missie
perks
grinned
as
he
answered
if
you
really
want
to
know
it
was
years
ago
come
the
fifteenth
of
this
then
why
do
you
keep
it
asked
phyllis
i
got
something
else
to
keep
besides
birthdays
said
perks
briefly
oh
what
asked
phyllis
eagerly
not
secrets
no
said
perks
the
kids
and
the
it
was
this
talk
that
set
the
children
thinking
and
presently
talking
perks
was
on
the
whole
the
dearest
friend
they
had
made
not
so
grand
as
the
station
master
but
more
approachable
less
powerful
than
the
old
gentleman
but
more
confidential
it
seems
horrid
that
nobody
keeps
his
birthday
said
bobbie
we
do
something
let
go
up
to
the
canal
bridge
and
talk
it
over
said
peter
i
got
a
new
gut
line
from
the
postman
this
morning
he
gave
it
me
for
a
bunch
of
roses
that
i
gave
him
for
his
sweetheart
she
then
i
do
think
you
might
have
given
her
the
roses
for
nothing
said
bobbie
indignantly
nyang
nyang
said
peter
disagreeably
and
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
did
of
course
said
phyllis
in
haste
directly
we
heard
she
was
ill
we
got
the
roses
ready
and
waited
by
the
gate
it
was
when
you
were
making
the
and
when
he
said
you
for
the
roses
so
many
times
much
more
than
he
need
have
he
pulled
out
the
line
and
gave
it
to
peter
it
was
exchange
it
was
the
grateful
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
peter
said
bobbie
i
am
so
do
mention
it
said
peter
grandly
i
knew
you
would
so
then
they
all
went
up
to
the
canal
bridge
the
idea
was
to
fish
from
the
bridge
but
the
line
was
not
quite
long
enough
never
mind
said
bobbie
let
just
stay
here
and
look
at
things
everything
so
it
was
the
sun
was
setting
in
red
splendour
over
the
grey
and
purple
hills
and
the
canal
lay
smooth
and
shiny
in
the
shadow
no
ripple
broke
its
surface
it
was
like
a
grey
satin
ribbon
between
the
dusky
green
silk
of
the
meadows
that
were
on
each
side
of
its
banks
it
all
right
said
peter
but
somehow
i
can
always
see
how
pretty
things
are
much
better
when
i
something
to
do
let
get
down
on
to
the
towpath
and
fish
from
phyllis
and
bobbie
remembered
how
the
boys
on
the
had
thrown
coal
at
them
and
they
said
so
oh
nonsense
said
peter
there
are
any
boys
here
now
if
there
were
i
fight
peter
sisters
were
kind
enough
not
to
remind
him
how
he
had
not
fought
the
boys
when
coal
had
last
been
thrown
instead
they
said
all
right
then
and
cautiously
climbed
down
the
steep
bank
to
the
the
line
was
carefully
baited
and
for
half
an
hour
they
fished
patiently
and
in
vain
not
a
single
nibble
came
to
nourish
hope
in
their
hearts
all
eyes
were
intent
on
the
sluggish
waters
that
earnestly
pretended
they
had
never
harboured
a
single
minnow
when
a
loud
rough
shout
made
them
start
hi
said
the
shout
in
most
disagreeable
tones
get
out
of
that
ca
you
an
old
white
horse
coming
along
the
was
within
half
a
dozen
yards
of
them
they
sprang
to
their
feet
and
hastily
climbed
up
the
bank
we
slip
down
again
when
they
gone
by
said
bobbie
but
alas
the
barge
after
the
manner
of
barges
stopped
under
the
bridge
she
going
to
anchor
said
peter
just
our
luck
the
barge
did
not
anchor
because
an
anchor
is
not
part
of
a
furniture
but
she
was
moored
with
ropes
fore
and
aft
and
the
ropes
were
made
fast
to
the
palings
and
to
crowbars
driven
into
the
ground
what
you
staring
at
growled
the
bargee
crossly
we
were
staring
said
bobbie
we
would
be
so
rude
be
blessed
said
the
man
get
along
with
you
get
along
yourself
said
peter
he
remembered
what
he
had
said
about
fighting
boys
and
besides
he
felt
safe
halfway
up
the
bank
we
as
much
right
here
as
anyone
oh
you
indeed
said
the
man
we
soon
see
about
and
he
came
across
his
deck
and
began
to
climb
down
the
side
of
his
barge
oh
come
away
peter
come
away
said
bobbie
and
phyllis
in
agonised
unison
not
me
said
peter
but
you
the
girls
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
bank
and
stood
ready
to
bolt
for
home
as
soon
as
they
saw
their
brother
out
of
danger
the
way
home
lay
all
down
hill
they
knew
that
they
all
ran
well
the
bargee
did
not
look
as
if
he
did
he
was
heavy
and
beefy
but
as
soon
as
his
foot
was
on
the
the
children
saw
that
they
had
misjudged
him
he
made
one
spring
up
the
bank
and
caught
peter
by
the
leg
dragged
him
down
set
him
on
his
feet
with
a
shake
took
him
by
the
ear
and
said
sternly
now
then
what
do
you
mean
by
it
do
you
know
these
waters
is
preserved
you
ai
no
right
catching
fish
not
to
say
nothing
of
your
precious
peter
was
always
proud
afterwards
when
he
remembered
that
with
the
bargee
furious
fingers
tightening
on
his
ear
the
bargee
crimson
countenance
close
to
his
own
the
bargee
hot
breath
on
his
neck
he
had
the
courage
to
speak
the
truth
i
was
catching
fish
said
peter
that
not
your
fault
i
be
bound
said
the
man
giving
peter
ear
a
twist
not
a
hard
one
but
still
a
twist
peter
could
not
say
that
it
was
bobbie
and
phyllis
had
been
holding
on
to
the
railings
above
and
skipping
with
anxiety
now
suddenly
bobbie
slipped
through
the
railings
and
rushed
down
the
bank
towards
peter
so
impetuously
that
phyllis
following
more
temperately
felt
certain
that
her
sister
descent
would
end
in
the
waters
of
the
canal
and
so
it
would
have
done
if
the
bargee
had
let
go
of
peter
ear
and
caught
her
in
his
jerseyed
arm
who
are
you
of
he
said
setting
her
on
her
feet
oh
said
bobbie
breathless
i
not
shoving
anybody
at
least
not
on
purpose
please
do
be
cross
with
peter
of
course
if
it
your
canal
we
sorry
and
we
wo
any
more
but
we
did
know
it
was
go
along
with
you
said
the
bargee
yes
we
will
indeed
we
will
said
bobbie
earnestly
but
we
do
beg
your
pardon
and
really
we
have
caught
a
single
fish
i
tell
you
directly
if
we
had
honour
bright
i
she
held
out
her
hands
and
phyllis
turned
out
her
little
empty
pocket
to
show
that
really
they
had
any
fish
concealed
about
them
well
said
the
bargee
more
gently
cut
along
then
and
do
you
do
it
again
that
the
children
hurried
up
the
bank
chuck
us
a
coat
shouted
the
man
and
a
woman
in
a
green
plaid
shawl
came
out
from
the
cabin
door
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
threw
a
coat
to
him
he
put
it
on
climbed
the
bank
and
slouched
along
across
the
bridge
towards
the
village
you
find
me
up
at
the
and
crown
when
you
got
the
kid
to
sleep
he
called
to
her
from
the
bridge
when
he
was
out
of
sight
the
children
slowly
returned
peter
insisted
on
this
the
canal
may
belong
to
him
he
said
though
i
do
believe
it
does
but
the
bridge
is
everybody
doctor
forrest
told
me
it
public
property
i
not
going
to
be
bounced
off
the
bridge
by
him
or
anyone
else
so
i
tell
peter
ear
was
still
sore
and
so
were
his
feelings
the
girls
followed
him
as
gallant
soldiers
might
follow
the
leader
of
a
forlorn
hope
i
do
wish
you
would
was
all
they
said
go
home
if
you
afraid
said
peter
leave
me
alone
i
not
the
sound
of
the
man
footsteps
died
away
along
the
quiet
road
the
peace
of
the
evening
was
not
broken
by
the
notes
of
the
or
by
the
voice
of
the
woman
in
the
barge
singing
her
baby
to
sleep
it
was
a
sad
song
she
sang
something
about
bill
bailey
and
how
she
wanted
him
to
come
home
the
children
stood
leaning
their
arms
on
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
they
were
glad
to
be
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
because
all
three
hearts
were
beating
much
more
quickly
i
not
going
to
be
driven
away
by
any
old
bargeman
i
not
said
peter
thickly
of
course
not
phyllis
said
soothingly
you
did
give
in
to
him
so
now
we
might
go
home
do
you
think
no
said
peter
nothing
more
was
said
till
the
woman
got
off
the
barge
climbed
the
bank
and
came
across
the
bridge
she
hesitated
looking
at
the
three
backs
of
the
children
then
she
said
peter
stayed
as
he
was
but
the
girls
looked
round
you
must
take
no
notice
of
my
bill
said
the
woman
bite
some
of
the
kids
down
farley
way
is
fair
terrors
it
was
them
put
back
up
calling
out
about

phyllis

the
woman

wherefore

she
added

said
bobbie
you

kind
where

cabin

the
woman
all

as

bobbie
i
would
have

the
face
brightened
as
she
spoke

said
peter
lor

said
the
woman
who
hurt
a
little
thing
like

there
so
long
the
woman
went
away
shall
we
go
home
said
phyllis
you
can
i
going
to
fish
said
peter
briefly
i
thought
we
came
up
here
to
talk
about
perks
birthday
said
phyllis
perks
birthday
so
they
got
down
on
the
again
and
peter
fished
he
did
not
catch
anything
it
was
almost
quite
dark
the
girls
were
getting
tired
and
as
bobbie
said
it
was
past
bedtime
when
suddenly
phyllis
cried
what
that
and
she
pointed
to
the
canal
boat
smoke
was
coming
from
the
chimney
of
the
cabin
had
indeed
been
curling
softly
into
the
soft
evening
air
all
the
time
but
now
other
wreaths
of
smoke
were
rising
and
these
were
from
the
cabin
door
it
on
fire
that
all
said
peter
calmly
serve
him
oh
how
can
you
cried
phyllis
think
of
the
poor
dear
the
baby
screamed
bobbie
in
an
instant
all
three
made
for
the
barge
her
mooring
ropes
were
slack
and
the
little
breeze
hardly
strong
enough
to
be
felt
had
yet
been
strong
enough
to
drift
her
stern
against
the
bank
bobbie
was
first
then
came
peter
and
it
was
peter
who
slipped
and
fell
he
went
into
the
canal
up
to
his
neck
and
his
feet
could
not
feel
the
bottom
but
his
arm
was
on
the
edge
of
the
barge
phyllis
caught
at
his
hair
it
hurt
but
it
helped
him
to
get
out
next
minute
he
had
leaped
on
to
the
barge
phyllis
following
not
you
he
shouted
to
bobbie
me
because
i
he
caught
up
with
bobbie
at
the
cabin
door
and
flung
her
aside
very
roughly
indeed
if
they
had
been
playing
such
roughness
would
have
made
bobbie
weep
with
tears
of
rage
and
pain
now
though
he
flung
her
on
to
the
edge
of
the
hold
so
that
her
knee
and
her
elbow
were
grazed
and
bruised
she
only
cried
no
not
you
me
and
struggled
up
again
but
not
quickly
enough
peter
had
already
gone
down
two
of
the
cabin
steps
into
the
cloud
of
thick
smoke
he
stopped
remembered
all
he
had
ever
heard
of
fires
pulled
his
soaked
handkerchief
out
of
his
breast
pocket
and
tied
it
over
his
mouth
as
he
pulled
it
out
he
said
it
all
right
hardly
any
fire
at
and
this
though
he
thought
it
was
a
lie
was
rather
good
of
peter
it
was
meant
to
keep
bobbie
from
rushing
after
him
into
danger
of
course
it
did
the
cabin
glowed
red
a
paraffin
lamp
was
burning
calmly
in
an
orange
mist
hi
said
peter
lifting
the
handkerchief
from
his
mouth
for
a
moment
hi
baby
where
are
you
he
choked
oh
let
me
go
cried
bobbie
close
behind
him
peter
pushed
her
back
more
roughly
than
before
and
went
on
now
what
would
have
happened
if
the
baby
had
cried
i
do
know
but
just
at
that
moment
it
did
cry
peter
felt
his
way
through
the
dark
smoke
found
something
small
and
soft
and
warm
and
alive
picked
it
up
and
backed
out
nearly
tumbling
over
bobbie
who
was
close
behind
a
dog
snapped
at
his
leg
tried
to
bark
choked
i
got
the
kid
said
peter
tearing
off
the
handkerchief
and
staggering
on
to
the
deck
bobbie
caught
at
the
place
where
the
bark
came
from
and
her
hands
met
on
the
fat
back
of
a
dog
it
turned
and
fastened
its
teeth
on
her
hand
but
very
gently
as
much
as
to
say
i
bound
to
bark
and
bite
if
strangers
come
into
my
master
cabin
but
i
know
you
mean
well
so
i
wo
really
bobbie
dropped
the
dog
all
right
old
man
good
dog
said
she
here
give
me
the
baby
peter
you
so
wet
you
give
it
peter
was
only
too
glad
to
hand
over
the
strange
little
bundle
that
squirmed
and
whimpered
in
his
arms
now
said
bobbie
quickly
you
run
straight
to
the
and
and
tell
them
phil
and
i
will
stay
here
with
the
precious
hush
then
a
dear
a
duck
a
darling
go
now
peter
run
i
ca
run
in
these
things
said
peter
firmly
they
as
heavy
as
lead
i
then
i
run
said
bobbie
get
on
the
bank
phil
and
i
hand
you
the
the
baby
was
carefully
handed
phyllis
sat
down
on
the
bank
and
tried
to
hush
the
baby
peter
wrung
the
water
from
his
sleeves
and
knickerbocker
legs
as
well
as
he
could
and
it
was
bobbie
who
ran
like
the
wind
across
the
bridge
and
up
the
long
white
quiet
twilight
road
towards
the
and
crown
there
is
a
nice
room
at
the
and
crown
where
bargees
and
their
wives
sit
of
an
evening
drinking
their
supper
beer
and
toasting
their
supper
cheese
at
a
glowing
basketful
of
coals
that
sticks
out
into
the
room
under
a
great
hooded
chimney
and
is
warmer
and
prettier
and
more
comforting
than
any
other
fireplace
ever
saw
there
was
a
pleasant
party
of
barge
people
round
the
fire
you
might
not
have
thought
it
pleasant
but
they
did
for
they
were
all
friends
or
acquaintances
and
they
liked
the
same
sort
of
things
and
talked
the
same
sort
of
talk
this
is
the
real
secret
of
pleasant
society
the
bargee
bill
whom
the
children
had
found
so
disagreeable
was
considered
excellent
company
by
his
mates
he
was
telling
a
tale
of
his
own
wrongs
always
a
thrilling
subject
it
was
his
barge
he
was
speaking
about
and
sent
down
word
her
inside
hout
not
namin
no
colour
d
see
so
i
gets
a
lotter
green
paint
and
i
paints
her
stem
to
stern
and
i
tell
yer
she
looked
then
comes
along
and
says
yer
paint
all
one
colour
for
says
and
i
says
says
i
i
thought
she

i
i
think
so
still
an
he
says
yer
then
ye
can
just
pay
for
the
bloomin
paint
yerself
says
he
an
i
to
a
murmur
of
sympathy
ran
round
the
room
breaking
noisily
in
on
it
came
bobbie
she
burst
open
the
swing
door
crying
breathlessly
bill
i
want
bill
the
there
was
a
stupefied
silence
pots
of
beer
were
held
in
paralysed
on
their
way
to
thirsty
mouths
oh
said
bobbie
seeing
the
bargewoman
and
making
for
her
your
barge
cabin
on
fire
go
the
woman
started
to
her
feet
and
put
a
big
red
hand
to
her
waist
on
the
left
side
where
your
heart
seems
to
be
when
you
are
frightened
or
miserable
reginald
horace
she
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
my
reginald
horace
all
right
said
bobbie
if
you
mean
the
baby
got
him
out
safe
dog
she
had
no
breath
for
more
except
go
on
it
all
then
she
sank
on
the
bench
and
tried
to
get
that
breath
of
relief
after
running
which
people
call
the
wind
but
she
felt
as
though
she
would
never
breathe
again
bill
the
bargee
rose
slowly
and
heavily
but
his
wife
was
a
hundred
yards
up
the
road
before
he
had
quite
understood
what
was
the
matter
phyllis
shivering
by
the
canal
side
had
hardly
heard
the
quick
approaching
feet
before
the
woman
had
flung
herself
on
the
railing
rolled
down
the
bank
and
snatched
the
baby
from
her
do
said
phyllis
reproachfully
i
just
got
him
to
bill
came
up
later
talking
in
a
language
with
which
the
children
were
wholly
unfamiliar
he
leaped
on
to
the
barge
and
dipped
up
pails
of
water
peter
helped
him
and
they
put
out
the
fire
phyllis
the
bargewoman
and
the
baby
and
presently
bobbie
too
cuddled
together
in
a
heap
on
the
bank
lord
help
me
if
it
was
me
left
anything
as
could
catch
alight
said
the
woman
again
and
again
but
it
was
she
it
was
bill
the
bargeman
who
had
knocked
his
pipe
out
and
the
red
ash
had
fallen
on
the
and
smouldered
there
and
at
last
broken
into
flame
though
a
stern
man
he
was
just
he
did
not
blame
his
wife
for
what
was
his
own
fault
as
many
bargemen
and
other
men
too
would
have
done
mother
was
half
wild
with
anxiety
when
at
last
the
three
children
turned
up
at
three
chimneys
all
very
wet
by
now
for
peter
seemed
to
have
come
off
on
the
others
but
when
she
had
disentangled
the
truth
of
what
had
happened
from
their
mixed
and
incoherent
narrative
she
owned
that
they
had
done
quite
right
and
could
not
possibly
have
done
otherwise
nor
did
she
put
any
obstacles
in
the
way
of
their
accepting
the
cordial
invitation
with
which
the
bargeman
had
parted
from
them
ye
be
here
at
seven
he
had
said
and
i
take
you
the
entire
trip
to
farley
and
back
so
i
will
and
not
a
penny
to
pay
nineteen
locks
they
did
not
know
what
locks
were
but
they
were
at
the
bridge
at
seven
with
bread
and
cheese
and
half
a
soda
cake
and
quite
a
quarter
of
a
leg
of
mutton
in
a
basket
it
was
a
glorious
day
the
old
white
horse
strained
at
the
ropes
the
barge
glided
smoothly
and
steadily
through
the
still
water
the
sky
was
blue
overhead
bill
was
as
nice
as
anyone
could
possibly
be
no
one
would
have
thought
that
he
could
be
the
same
man
who
had
held
peter
by
the
ear
as
for
bill
she
had
always
been
nice
as
bobbie
said
and
so
had
the
baby
and
even
spot
who
might
have
bitten
them
quite
badly
if
he
had
liked
it
was
simply
ripping
mother
said
peter
when
they
reached
home
very
happy
very
tired
and
very
dirty
right
over
that
glorious
aqueduct
and
locks
you
do
know
what
they
like
you
sink
into
the
ground
and
then
when
you
feel
you
never
going
to
stop
going
down
two
great
black
gates
open
slowly
slowly
you
go
out
and
there
you
are
on
the
canal
just
like
you
were
i
know
said
mother
there
are
locks
on
the
thames
father
and
i
used
to
go
on
the
river
at
marlow
before
we
were
and
the
dear
darling
ducky
baby
said
bobbie
it
let
me
nurse
it
for
ages
and
ages
and
it
was
so
good
mother
i
wish
we
had
a
baby
to
play
and
everybody
was
so
nice
to
us
said
phyllis
everybody
we
met
and
they
say
we
may
fish
whenever
we
like
and
bill
is
going
to
show
us
the
way
next
time
he
in
these
parts
he
says
we
do
know
he
said
you
did
know
said
peter
but
mother
he
said
he
tell
all
the
bargees
up
and
down
the
canal
that
we
were
the
real
right
sort
and
they
were
to
treat
us
like
good
pals
as
we
so
then
i
said
phyllis
interrupted
we
always
each
wear
a
red
ribbon
when
we
went
fishing
by
the
canal
so
they
know
it
was
us
and
we
were
the
real
right
sort
and
be
nice
to
us
so
you
made
another
lot
of
friends
said
mother
first
the
railway
and
then
the
canal
oh
yes
said
bobbie
i
think
everyone
in
the
world
is
friends
if
you
can
only
get
them
to
see
you
do
want
to
be
perhaps
you
right
said
mother
and
she
sighed
come
chicks
yes
said
phyllis
oh
dear
and
we
went
up
there
to
talk
about
what
we
do
for
perks
birthday
and
we
have
talked
a
single
thing
about
it
no
more
we
have
said
bobbie
but
peter
saved
reginald
life
i
think
that
about
good
enough
for
one
bobbie
would
have
saved
him
if
i
had
knocked
her
down
twice
i
did
said
peter
loyally
so
would
i
said
phyllis
if
i
known
what
to
yes
said
mother
you
saved
a
little
child
life
i
do
think
that
enough
for
one
evening
oh
my
darlings
thank
god
you
all
safe
chapter
ix
the
pride
of
perks
it
was
mother
face
was
very
bright
as
she
poured
the
milk
and
ladled
out
the
porridge
i
sold
another
story
chickies
she
said
the
one
about
the
king
of
the
mussels
so
there
be
buns
for
tea
you
can
go
and
get
them
as
soon
as
they
baked
about
eleven
is
it
peter
phyllis
and
bobbie
exchanged
glances
with
each
other
six
glances
in
all
then
bobbie
said
mother
would
you
mind
if
we
did
have
the
buns
for
tea
but
on
the
fifteenth
that
next
do
mind
when
you
have
them
dear
said
mother
but
why
because
it
perks
birthday
said
bobbie
he
and
he
says
he
does
keep
his
birthday
any
more
because
he
got
other
things
to
keep
not
rabbits
or
secrets
but
the
kids
and
the
you
mean
his
wife
and
children
said
mother
yes
said
phyllis
it
the
same
thing
is
it
and
we
thought
we
make
a
nice
birthday
for
him
he
been
so
awfully
jolly
decent
to
us
you
know
mother
said
peter
and
we
agreed
that
next
we
ask
you
if
we
but
suppose
there
had
been
a
before
the
fifteenth
said
mother
oh
then
we
meant
to
ask
you
to
let
us
anti
antipate
it
and
go
without
when
the
anticipate
said
mother
i
see
certainly
it
would
be
nice
to
put
his
name
on
the
buns
with
pink
sugar
would
it
perks
said
peter
it
not
a
pretty
his
other
name
albert
said
phyllis
i
asked
him
we
might
put
said
mother
i
show
you
how
when
the
day
this
was
all
very
well
as
far
as
it
went
but
even
fourteen
halfpenny
buns
with
on
them
in
pink
sugar
do
not
of
themselves
make
a
very
grand
celebration
there
are
always
flowers
of
course
said
bobbie
later
when
a
really
earnest
council
was
being
held
on
the
subject
in
the
where
the
broken
machine
was
and
the
row
of
holes
to
drop
hay
through
into
the
over
the
mangers
of
the
stables
below
he
got
lots
of
flowers
of
his
own
said
peter
but
it
always
nice
to
have
them
given
you
said
bobbie
however
many
you
got
of
your
own
we
can
use
flowers
for
trimmings
to
the
birthday
but
there
must
be
something
to
trim
besides
let
all
be
quiet
and
think
said
phyllis
no
one
to
speak
until
it
thought
of
so
they
were
all
quiet
and
so
very
still
that
a
brown
rat
thought
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
loft
and
came
out
very
boldly
when
bobbie
sneezed
the
rat
was
quite
shocked
and
hurried
away
for
he
saw
that
a
where
such
things
could
happen
was
no
place
for
a
respectable
rat
that
liked
a
quiet
life
hooray
cried
peter
suddenly
i
got
he
jumped
up
and
kicked
at
the
loose
hay
what
said
the
others
eagerly
why
perks
is
so
nice
to
everybody
there
must
be
lots
of
people
in
the
village
who
like
to
help
to
make
him
a
birthday
let
go
round
and
ask
mother
said
we
were
to
ask
people
for
things
said
bobbie
doubtfully
for
ourselves
she
meant
silly
not
for
other
people
i
ask
the
old
gentleman
too
you
see
if
i
do
said
peter
let
ask
mother
first
said
bobbie
oh
what
the
use
of
bothering
mother
about
every
little
thing
said
peter
especially
when
she
busy
come
on
let
go
down
to
the
village
now
and
so
they
went
the
old
lady
at
the
said
she
did
see
why
perks
should
have
a
birthday
any
more
than
anyone
else
no
said
bobbie
i
should
like
everyone
to
have
one
only
we
know
when
his
mine
said
the
old
lady
and
much
notice
anyone
will
take
of
it
go
along
with
so
they
went
and
some
people
were
kind
and
some
were
crusty
and
some
would
give
and
some
would
not
it
is
rather
difficult
work
asking
for
things
even
for
other
people
as
you
have
no
doubt
found
if
you
have
ever
tried
it
when
the
children
got
home
and
counted
up
what
had
been
given
and
what
had
been
promised
they
felt
that
for
the
first
day
it
was
not
so
bad
peter
wrote
down
the
lists
of
the
things
in
the
little
where
he
kept
the
numbers
of
his
engines
these
were
the
lists
given
a
tobacco
pipe
from
the
sweet
shop
half
a
pound
of
tea
from
the
grocer
a
woollen
scarf
slightly
faded
from
the
draper
which
was
the
other
side
of
the
grocer
a
stuffed
squirrel
from
the
doctor
promised
a
piece
of
meat
from
the
butcher
six
fresh
eggs
from
the
woman
who
lived
in
the
old
turnpike
cottage
a
piece
of
honeycomb
and
six
bootlaces
from
the
cobbler
and
an
iron
shovel
from
the
blacksmith
very
early
next
morning
bobbie
got
up
and
woke
phyllis
this
had
been
agreed
on
between
them
they
had
not
told
peter
because
they
thought
he
would
think
it
silly
but
they
told
him
afterwards
when
it
had
turned
out
all
right
they
cut
a
big
bunch
of
roses
and
put
it
in
a
basket
with
the
that
phyllis
had
made
for
bobbie

pretty
blue
necktie
of
phyllis
then
they
wrote
on
a
paper
ransome
with
our
best
love
because
it
is
her
birthday
and
they
put
the
paper
in
the
basket
and
they
took
it
to
the
and
went
in
and
put
it
on
the
counter
and
ran
away
before
the
old
woman
at
the
had
time
to
get
into
her
shop
when
they
got
home
peter
had
grown
confidential
over
helping
mother
to
get
the
breakfast
and
had
told
her
their
plans
there
no
harm
in
it
said
mother
but
it
depends
how
you
do
it
i
only
hope
he
wo
be
offended
and
think
it
charity
poor
people
are
very
proud
you
it
is
because
he
poor
said
phyllis

because
we
fond
of
i

some
things
that
phyllis
has
outgrown
said
mother
if
you
quite
sure
you
can
give
them
to
him
without
his
being
offended
i
should
like
to
do
some
little
thing
for
him
because

so
kind
to
you
i
ca

much
because
we

the
morning
of
the
fifteenth
was
spent
very
happily
in
getting
the
buns
and
watching
mother
make
on
them
with
pink
sugar
you
know
how
it
done
of
course
you
beat
up
whites
of
eggs
and
mix
powdered
sugar
with
them
and
put
in
a
few
drops
of
cochineal
and
then
you
make
a
cone
of
clean
white
paper
with
a
little
hole
at
the
pointed
end
and
put
the
pink
in
at
the
big
end
it
runs
slowly
out
at
the
pointed
end
and
you
write
the
letters
with
it
just
as
though
it
were
a
great
fat
pen
full
of
pink
the
buns
looked
beautiful
with
on
every
one
and
when
they
were
put
in
a
cool
oven
to
set
the
sugar
the
children
went
up
to
the
village
to
collect
the
honey
and
the
shovel
and
the
other
promised
things
the
old
lady
at
the

standing
on
her
doorstep

all
the
children
together
when

had
got
out

perambulator
and
taken
off
the
careful
papers
that
covered
it
and
dusted

all
over

ransome
sighing
and
then
laughing
here
i

peppermint
cushions

and
then
you
run
along
before
i
give
you
the
roof
off
my
head
and
the
clothes
off
my
all
the
things
that
had
been
collected
for
perks
were
packed
into
the
perambulator
and
at
three
peter
and
bobbie
and
phyllis
wheeled
it
down
to
the
little
yellow
house
where
perks
lived
the
house
was
very
tidy
on
the
window
ledge
was
a
jug
of
big
daisies
and
red
sorrel
and
feathery
flowery
grasses
there
was
a
sound
of
splashing
from
the
and
a
partly
washed
boy
put
his
head
round
the
door
mother
of
herself
he
said
down
in
a
minute
a
voice
sounded
down
the
narrow
freshly
scrubbed
stairs
the
children
waited
next
moment
the
stairs
creaked
and
mrs
perks
came
down
buttoning
her
bodice
her
hair
was
brushed
very
smooth
and
tight
and
her
face
shone
with
soap
and
water
i
a
bit
late
changing
miss
she
said
to
bobbie
owing
to
me
having
had
a
extry
along
o
perks
happening
to
name
its
being
his
birthday
i
do
know
what
put
it
into
his
head
to
think
of
such
a
thing
we
keeps
the
children
birthdays
of
course
but
him
and
me
we
too
old
for
such
like
as
a
general
we
knew
it
was
his
birthday
said
peter
and
we
got
some
presents
for
him
outside
in
the
as
the
presents
were
being
unpacked
mrs
perks
gasped
when
they
were
all
unpacked
she
surprised
and
horrified
the
children
by
sitting
suddenly
down
on
a
wooden
chair
and
bursting
into
tears
oh
do
said
everybody
oh
please
do
and
peter
added
perhaps
a
little
impatiently
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
you
mean
to
say
you
do
like
it
mrs
perks
only
sobbed
the
perks
children
now
as
as
anyone
could
wish
stood
at
the
door
and
scowled
at
the
intruders
there
was
a
silence
an
awkward
silence
do
you
like
it
said
peter
again
while
his
sisters
patted
mrs
perks
on
the
back
she
stopped
crying
as
suddenly
as
she
had
begun
there
there
do
you
mind
me
i
all
right
she
said
like
it
why
it
a
birthday
such
as
perks
never
not
even
when
was
a
boy
and
stayed
with
his
uncle
who
was
a
corn
chandler
in
his
own
account
he
failed
afterwards
like
it
oh
and
then
she
went
on
and
said
all
sorts
of
things
that
i
wo
write
down
because
i
am
sure
that
peter
and
bobbie
and
phyllis
would
not
like
me
to
their
ears
got
hotter
and
hotter
and
their
faces
redder
and
redder
at
the
kind
things
mrs
perks
said
they
felt
they
had
done
nothing
to
deserve
all
this
praise
at
last
peter
said
look
here
we
glad
you
pleased
but
if
you
go
on
saying
things
like
that
we
must
go
home
and
we
did
want
to
stay
and
see
if
mr
perks
is
pleased
too
but
we
ca
stand
i
wo
say
another
single
word
said
mrs
perks
with
a
beaming
face
but
that
need
stop
me
thinking
need
it
for
if
ever
can
we
have
a
plate
for
the
buns
bobbie
asked
abruptly
and
then
mrs
perks
hastily
laid
the
table
for
tea
and
the
buns
and
the
honey
and
the
gooseberries
were
displayed
on
plates
and
the
roses
were
put
in
two
glass
jam
jars
and
the
looked
as
mrs
perks
said
fit
for
a
to
think
she
said
me
getting
the
place
tidy
early
and
the
little
getting
the
and
all
when
never
did
i
think
there
be
anything
more
for
him
except
the
ounce
of
his
pet
particular
that
i
got
o
saturday
and
been
saving
up
for
ever
since
bless
us
is
early
perks
had
indeed
unlatched
the
latch
of
the
little
front
gate
oh
whispered
bobbie
let
hide
in
the
back
kitchen
and
you
tell
him
about
it
but
give
him
the
tobacco
first
because
you
got
it
for
him
and
when
you
told
him
we
all
come
in
and
shout
happy
returns
it
was
a
very
nice
plan
but
it
did
not
quite
come
off
to
begin
with
there
was
only
just
time
for
peter
and
bobbie
and
phyllis
to
rush
into
the
pushing
the
young
and
perks
children
in
front
of
them
there
was
not
time
to
shut
the
door
so
that
without
at
all
meaning
it
they
had
to
listen
to
what
went
on
in
the
kitchen
the
was
a
tight
fit
for
the
perks
children
and
the
three
chimneys
children
as
well
as
all
the
proper
furniture
including
the
mangle
and
the
copper
hullo
old
woman
they
heard
mr
perks
voice
say
here
a
pretty
it

birthday

said
mrs
perks
and
here

ounce
of
your
extry
particular

it
o
saturday
along
o
your
happening
to
remember
it
was
your
birthday
good
old
girl
said
mr
perks
and
there
was
a
sound
of
a
kiss
but
what
that
pram
doing
here
and
what
all
these
bundles
and
where
did
you
get
the
sweetstuff
and
the
children
did
not
hear
what
mrs
perks
replied
because
just
then
bobbie
gave
a
start
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
and
all
her
body
grew
stiff
with
horror
oh
she
whispered
to
the
others
whatever
shall
we
do
i
forgot
to
put
the
labels
on
any
of
the
things
he
wo
know
what
from
who
he
think
it
all
us
and
that
we
trying
to
be
grand
or
charitable
or
something
hush
said
peter
and
then
they
heard
the
voice
of
mr
perks
loud
and
rather
angry
i
do
care
he
said
i
wo
stand
it
and
so
i
tell
you
but
said
mrs
perks
it
them
children

such
a
fuss
about
the
children
from
the
three
i
do
care
said
perks
firmly
not
if
it
was
a
angel
from
heaven
we
got
on
all
right
all
these
years
and
no
favours
asked
i
not
going
to
begin
these
sort
of
charity
at
my
time
of
life
so
do
you
think
it
oh
hush
said
poor
mrs
perks
bert
shut
your
silly
tongue
for
goodness
sake
the
all
three
of
in
the
to
every
word
you
then
i
give
them
something
to
listen
to
said
the
angry
perks
i
spoke
my
mind
to
them
afore
now
and
i
do
it
again
he
added
and
he
took
two
strides
to
the
door
and
flung
it
wide
open
as
wide
that
is
as
it
would
go
with
the
tightly
packed
children
behind
it
come
out
said
perks
come
out
and
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
it
i
ever
complained
to
you
of
being
short
as
you
comes

charity
lay
over
me
oh
said
phyllis
i
thought
you
be
so
pleased
i
never
try
to
be
kind
to
anyone
else
as
long
as
i
live
no
i
wo
not
she
burst
into
tears
we
did
mean
any
harm
said
peter
it
ai
what
you
means
so
much
as
what
you
does
said
perks
oh
do
cried
bobbie
trying
hard
to
be
braver
than
phyllis
and
to
find
more
words
than
peter
had
done
for
explaining
in
we
thought
love
it
we
always
have
things
on
our
oh
yes
said
perks
your
own
relations
that
oh
no
bobbie
answered
not
our
own
relations
all
the
servants
always
gave
us
things
at
home
and
us
to
them
when
it
was
their
birthdays
and
when
it
was
mine
and
mother
gave
me
the
brooch
like
a
buttercup
viney
gave
me
two
lovely
glass
pots
and
nobody
thought
she
was
coming
the
charity
lay
over
if
it
had
been
glass
pots
here
said
perks
i
would
ha
said
so
much
it
there
being
all
this
heaps
and
heaps
of
things
i
ca
stand
no
nor
wo
but
they
not
all
from
us
said
peter
only
we
forgot
to
put
the
labels
on
they
from
all
sorts
of
people
in
the
who
put
up
to
it
i
like
to
know
asked
perks
why
we
did
sniffed
phyllis
perks
sat
down
heavily
in
the
and
looked
at
them
with
what
bobbie
afterwards
described
as
withering
glances
of
gloomy
despair
so
you
been
round
telling
the
neighbours
we
ca
make
both
ends
meet
well
now
you
disgraced
us
as
deep
as
you
can
in
the
neighbourhood
you
can
just
take
the
whole
bag
of
tricks
back
it
come
from
very
much
obliged
i
sure
i
do
doubt
but
what
you
meant
it
kind
but
i
rather
not
be
acquainted
with
you
any
longer
if
all
the
same
to
he
deliberately
turned
the
chair
round
so
that
his
back
was
turned
to
the
children
the
legs
of
the
chair
grated
on
the
brick
floor
and
that
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
silence
then
suddenly
bobbie
spoke
look
here
she
said
this
is
most
that
what
i
says
said
perks
not
turning
round
look
here
said
bobbie
desperately
we
go
if
you
like
and
you
need
be
friends
with
us
any
more
if
you
do
want
but
we
shall
always
be
friends
with
you
however
nasty
you
are
to
us
sniffed
phyllis
wildly
be
quiet
said
peter
in
a
fierce
aside
but
before
we
go
bobbie
went
on
desperately
do
let
us
show
you
the
labels
we
wrote
to
put
on
the
i
do
want
to
see
no
labels
said
perks
except
proper
luggage
ones
in
my
own
walk
of
life
do
you
think
i
kept
respectable
and
outer
debt
on
what
i
gets
and
her
having
to
take
in
washing
to
be
give
away
for
a
to
all
the
neighbours
laughing
said
peter
you
do
you
a
very
hasty
gentleman

you
were
wrong
once
before
about
us
not
telling
you
the
secret
about
the
russian
do
let
bobbie
tell
you
about
the
labels
well
go
ahead
said
perks
grudgingly
well
then
said
bobbie
fumbling
miserably
yet
not
without
hope
in
her
tightly
stuffed
pocket
we
wrote
down
all
the
things
everybody
said
when
they
gave
us
the
things
with
the
people
names
because
mother
said
we
ought
to
be
careful
because
but
i
wrote
down
what
she
said
and
you
but
bobbie
could
not
read
the
labels
just
at
once
she
had
to
swallow
once
or
twice
before
she
could
begin
mrs
perks
had
been
crying
steadily
ever
since
her
husband
had
opened
the
door
now
she
caught
her
breath
choked
and
said
do
you
upset
yourself
missy
know
you
meant
it
kind
if
he
may
i
read
the
labels
said
bobbie
crying
on
to
the
slips
as
she
tried
to
sort
them
mother
first
it
says
clothes
for
mrs
perks
children
mother
said
find
some
of
phyllis
things
that
she
grown
out
of
if
you
quite
sure
mr
perks
would
be
offended
and
think
it
meant
for
charity
like
to
do
some
little
thing
for
him
because
he
so
kind
to
you
i
ca
do
much
because
we
poor
ourselves
bobbie
paused
that
all
right
said
perks
your

bobbie

and
she

be
a
help
with
her
fine

she
told
me
to

bobbie
added
that
it
was
her
emmie
little
one

bert
said
mrs
perks
firmly
and
i
wo
so
do
you
ask
me

said
perks
gruffly
then
the
shovel
said
bobbie
mr
james
made
it
for
you
himself
and
he
said
where
is
it
oh
yes
here
he
said
tell
mr
perks
it
a
pleasure
to
make
a
little
trifle
for
a
man
as

so
much
respected
and
then
he
said
he
wished
he
could
shoe
your
children
and
his

children
like
they
do
the
horses
because
well
he
knew
what
shoe

perks
then

bobbie
in
haste
and

respected
a
man
that
paid
his
way
and
the
butcher
said
the
same
and
the
old
turnpike
woman
said
many
was
the
time
you
lent
her
a
hand
with
her
garden
when
you
were
a
lad
and
things
like
that
came
home
to
roost
i
do
know
what
she
meant
and
everybody
who
gave
anything
said
they
liked
you
and
it
was
a
very
good
idea
of
ours
and
nobody
said
anything
about
charity
or
anything
horrid
like
that
and
the
old
gentleman
gave
peter
a
gold
pound
for
you
and
said
you
were
a
man
who
knew
your
work
and
i
thought
you
love
to
know
how
fond
people
are
of
you
and
i
never
was
so
unhappy
in
my
life
i
hope
forgive
us
some
day
she
could
say
no
more
and
she
turned
to
go
stop
said
perks
still
with
his
back
to
them
i
take
back
every
word
i
said
contrary
to
what
you
wish
nell
set
on
the
we
take
the
things
away
if
you
unhappy
about
them
said
peter
but
i
think
everybody
be
most
awfully
disappointed
as
well
as
i
not
unhappy
about
them
said
perks
i
do
know
he
added
suddenly
wheeling
the
chair
round
and
showing
a
very
face
i
do
know
as
ever
i
was
better
pleased
not
so
much
with
the
presents
though
they
an
collection
but
the
kind
respect
of
our
neighbours
that
worth
having
eh
nell
i
think
it
all
worth
having
said
mrs
perks
and
you
made
a
most
ridiculous
fuss
about
nothing
bert
if
you
ask
no
i
ai
said
perks
firmly
if
a
man
did
respect
hisself
no
one
would
do
it
for
but
everyone
respects
you
said
bobbie
they
all
said
i
knew
you
like
it
when
you
really
understood
said
phyllis
brightly
humph
you
stay
to
tea
said
mr
perks
later
on
peter
proposed
mr
perks
health
and
mr
perks
proposed
a
toast
also
honoured
in
tea
and
the
toast
was
may
the
garland
of
friendship
be
ever
green
which
was
much
more
poetical
than
anyone
had
expected
from
him
jolly
good
little
kids
those
said
mr
perks
to
his
wife
as
they
went
to
bed
oh
they
all
right
bless
their
hearts
said
his
wife
it
you
that
the
aggravatingest
old
thing
that
ever
was
i
was
ashamed
of
you
i
tell
you
you
did
need
to
be
old
gal
i
climbed
down
handsome
soon
as
i
understood
it
was
charity
but
charity
what
i
never
did
abide
and
wo
all
sorts
of
people
were
made
happy
by
that
birthday
party
mr
perks
and
mrs
perks
and
the
little
perkses
by
all
the
nice
things
and
by
the
kind
thoughts
of
their
neighbours
the
three
chimneys
children
by
the
success
undoubted
though
unexpectedly
delayed
of
their
plan
and
ransome
every
time
she
saw
the
fat
perks
baby
in
the
perambulator
mrs
perks
made
quite
a
round
of
visits
to
thank
people
for
their
kind
birthday
presents
and
after
each
visit
felt
that
she
had
a
better
friend
than
she
had
thought
yes
said
perks
reflectively
it
not
so
much
what
you
does
as
what
you
means
that
what
i
say
now
if
it
had
been
charity
oh
drat
charity
said
mrs
perks
nobody
wo
offer
you
charity
bert
however
much
you
was
to
want
it
i
lay
that
was
just
friendliness
that
when
the
clergyman
called
on
mrs
perks
she
told
him
all
about
it
it
was
friendliness
was
it
sir
said
she
i
think
said
the
clergyman
it
was
what
is
sometimes
called
so
you
see
it
was
all
right
in
the
end
but
if
one
does
that
sort
of
thing
one
has
to
be
careful
to
do
it
in
the
right
way
for
as
mr
perks
said
when
he
had
time
to
think
it
over
it
not
so
much
what
you
do
as
what
you
mean
chapter
x
the
terrible
secret
when
they
first
went
to
live
at
three
chimneys
the
children
had
talked
a
great
deal
about
their
father
and
had
asked
a
great
many
questions
about
him
and
what
he
was
doing
and
where
he
was
and
when
he
would
come
home
mother
always
answered
their
questions
as
well
as
she
could
but
as
the
time
went
on
they
grew
to
speak
less
of
him
bobbie
had
felt
almost
from
the
first
that
for
some
strange
miserable
reason
these
questions
hurt
mother
and
made
her
sad
and
little
by
little
the
others
came
to
have
this
feeling
too
though
they
could
not
have
put
it
into
words
one
day
when
mother
was
working
so
hard
that
she
could
not
leave
off
even
for
ten
minutes
bobbie
carried
up
her
tea
to
the
big
bare
room
that
they
called
mother
workshop
it
had
hardly
any
furniture
just
a
table
and
a
chair
and
a
rug
but
always
big
pots
of
flowers
on
the
and
on
the
mantelpiece
the
children
saw
to
that
and
from
the
three
long
uncurtained
windows
the
beautiful
stretch
of
meadow
and
moorland
the
far
violet
of
the
hills
and
the
unchanging
changefulness
of
cloud
and
sky
here
your
tea
said
bobbie
do
drink
it
while
mother
laid
down
her
pen
among
the
pages
that
were
scattered
all
over
the
table
pages
covered
with
her
writing
which
was
almost
as
plain
as
print
and
much
prettier
she
ran
her
hands
into
her
hair
as
if
she
were
going
to
pull
it
out
by
handfuls
poor
dear
head
said
bobbie
does
it
ache
no
yes
not
much
said
mother
bobbie
do
you
think
peter
and
phil
are
forgetting
father
no
said
bobbie
indignantly
why
you
none
of
you
ever
speak
of
him
bobbie
stood
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
we
often
talk
about
him
when
we
by
ourselves
she
said
but
not
to
me
said
mother
why
bobbie
did
not
find
it
easy
to
say
why
i
you
she
said
and
stopped
she
went
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
bobbie
come
here
said
her
mother
and
bobbie
came
now
said
mother
putting
her
arm
round
bobbie
and
laying
her
ruffled
head
against
bobbie
shoulder
try
to
tell
me
bobbie
fidgeted
tell
well
then
said
bobbie
i
thought
you
were
so
unhappy
about
daddy
not
being
here
it
made
you
worse
when
i
talked
about
him
so
i
stopped
doing
and
the
others
i
do
know
about
the
others
said
bobbie
i
never
said
anything
about
that
to
them
but
i
expect
they
felt
the
same
about
it
as
bobbie
dear
said
mother
still
leaning
her
head
against
her
tell
you
besides
parting
from
father
he
and
i
have
had
a
great
sorrow
oh
terrible
worse
than
anything
you
can
think
of
and
at
first
it
did
hurt
to
hear
you
all
talking
of
him
as
if
everything
were
just
the
same
but
it
would
be
much
more
terrible
if
you
were
to
forget
him
that
would
be
worse
than
the
trouble
said
bobbie
in
a
very
little
voice
i
promised
i
would
never
ask
you
any
questions
and
i
never
have
have
i
but
the
trouble
it
wo
last
always
no
said
mother
the
worst
will
be
over
when
father
comes
home
to
i
wish
i
could
comfort
you
said
bobbie
oh
my
dear
do
you
suppose
you
do
do
you
think
i
have
noticed
how
good
you
all
been
not
quarrelling
nearly
as
much
as
you
used
to
and
all
the
little
kind
things
you
do
for
me
the
flowers
and
cleaning
my
shoes
and
tearing
up
to
make
my
bed
before
i
get
time
to
do
it
myself
bobbie
had
sometimes
wondered
whether
mother
noticed
these
things
that
nothing
she
said
to
what
i
must
get
on
with
my
work
said
mother
giving
bobbie
one
last
squeeze
do
say
anything
to
the
that
evening
in
the
hour
before
instead
of
reading
to
the
children
mother
told
them
stories
of
the
games
she
and
father
used
to
have
when
they
were
children
and
lived
near
each
other
in
the
country
tales
of
the
adventures
of
father
with
mother
brothers
when
they
were
all
boys
together
very
funny
stories
they
were
and
the
children
laughed
as
they
listened
uncle
edward
died
before
he
was
grown
up
did
he
said
phyllis
as
mother
lighted
the
bedroom
candles
yes
dear
said
mother
you
would
have
loved
him
he
was
such
a
brave
boy
and
so
adventurous
always
in
mischief
and
yet
friends
with
everybody
in
spite
of
it
and
your
uncle
reggie
in
ceylon
yes
and
father
away
too
but
i
think
they
all
like
to
think
we
enjoyed
talking
about
the
things
they
used
to
do
do
you
think
so
not
uncle
edward
said
phyllis
in
a
shocked
tone
he
in
you
do
suppose
he
forgotten
us
and
all
the
old
times
because
god
has
taken
him
any
more
than
i
forget
him
oh
no
he
remembers
only
away
for
a
little
time
we
shall
see
him
some
and
uncle
reggie
and
father
too
said
peter
yes
said
mother
uncle
reggie
and
father
too
good
night
my
good
night
said
everyone
bobbie
hugged
her
mother
more
closely
even
than
usual
and
whispered
in
her
ear
oh
i
do
love
you
so
mummy
i
do
i
do
when
bobbie
came
to
think
it
all
over
she
tried
not
to
wonder
what
the
great
trouble
was
but
she
could
not
always
help
it
father
was
not
dead
like
poor
uncle
edward
mother
had
said
so
and
he
was
not
ill
or
mother
would
have
been
with
him
being
poor
was
the
trouble
bobbie
knew
it
was
something
nearer
the
heart
than
money
could
be
i
must
try
to
think
what
it
is
she
told
herself
no
i
must
i
am
glad
mother
noticed
about
us
not
quarrelling
so
much
we
keep
that
and
alas
that
very
afternoon
she
and
peter
had
what
peter
called
a
shindy
they
had
not
been
a
week
at
three
chimneys
before
they
had
asked
mother
to
let
them
have
a
piece
of
garden
each
for
their
very
own
and
she
had
agreed
and
the
south
border
under
the
peach
trees
had
been
divided
into
three
pieces
and
they
were
allowed
to
plant
whatever
they
liked
there
phyllis
had
planted
mignonette
and
nasturtium
and
virginia
stock
in
hers
the
seeds
came
up
and
though
they
looked
just
like
weeds
phyllis
believed
that
they
would
bear
flowers
some
day
the
virginia
stock
justified
her
faith
quite
soon
and
her
garden
was
gay
with
a
band
of
bright
little
flowers
pink
and
white
and
red
and
mauve
i
ca
weed
for
fear
i
pull
up
the
wrong
things
she
used
to
say
comfortably
it
saves
such
a
lot
of
peter
sowed
vegetable
seeds
in
his
carrots
and
onions
and
turnips
the
seed
was
given
to
him
by
the
farmer
who
lived
in
the
nice
house
just
beyond
the
bridge
he
kept
turkeys
and
guinea
fowls
and
was
a
most
amiable
man
but
vegetables
never
had
much
of
a
chance
because
he
liked
to
use
the
earth
of
his
garden
for
digging
canals
and
making
forts
and
earthworks
for
his
toy
soldiers
and
the
seeds
of
vegetables
rarely
come
to
much
in
a
soil
that
is
constantly
disturbed
for
the
purposes
of
war
and
irrigation
bobbie
planted
in
her
garden
but
all
the
little
new
leaves
of
the
shrivelled
and
withered
perhaps
because
she
moved
them
from
the
other
part
of
the
garden
in
may
which
is
not
at
all
the
right
time
of
year
for
moving
roses
but
she
would
not
own
that
they
were
dead
and
hoped
on
against
hope
until
the
day
when
perks
came
up
to
see
the
garden
and
told
her
quite
plainly
that
all
her
roses
were
as
dead
as
doornails
only
good
for
bonfires
miss
he
said
you
just
dig
up
and
burn
and
i
give
you
some
nice
fresh
roots
outer
my
garden
pansies
and
stocks
and
sweet
willies
and
i
bring
along
if
you
get
the
ground
so
next
day
she
set
to
work
and
that
happened
to
be
the
day
when
mother
had
praised
her
and
the
others
about
not
quarrelling
she
moved
the
and
carried
them
to
the
other
end
of
the
garden
where
the
rubbish
heap
was
that
they
meant
to
make
a
bonfire
of
when
guy
day
came
meanwhile
peter
had
decided
to
flatten
out
all
his
forts
and
earthworks
with
a
view
to
making
a
model
of
the
cutting
embankment
canal
aqueduct
bridges
and
all
so
when
bobbie
came
back
from
her
last
thorny
journey
with
the
dead
he
had
got
the
rake
and
was
using
it
busily
was
using
the
rake
said
bobbie
well
i
using
it
now
said
peter
but
i
had
it
first
said
bobbie
then
it
my
turn
now
said
peter
and
that
was
how
the
quarrel
began
you
always
being
disagreeable
about
nothing
said
peter
after
some
heated
argument
i
had
the
rake
first
said
bobbie
flushed
and
defiant
holding
on
to
its
handle
do
i
tell
you
i
said
this
morning
i
meant
to
have
it
did
i
phil
phyllis
said
she
did
want
to
be
mixed
up
in
their
rows
and
instantly
of
course
she
was
if
you
remember
you
ought
to
of
course
she
does
remember
but
she
might
say
i
wish
i
had
a
brother
instead
of
two
whiny
little
kiddy
sisters
said
peter
this
was
always
recognised
as
indicating
the
mark
of
peter
rage
bobbie
made
the
reply
she
always
made
to
it
i
ca
think
why
little
boys
were
ever
invented
and
just
as
she
said
it
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
three
long
windows
of
mother
workshop
flashing
in
the
red
rays
of
the
sun
the
sight
brought
back
those
words
of
praise
you
do
quarrel
like
you
used
to
oh
cried
bobbie
just
as
if
she
had
been
hit
or
had
caught
her
finger
in
a
door
or
had
felt
the
hideous
sharp
beginnings
of
toothache
what
the
matter
said
phyllis
bobbie
wanted
to
say
do
let
quarrel
mother
hates
it
so
but
though
she
tried
hard
she
could
peter
was
looking
too
disagreeable
and
insulting
take
the
horrid
rake
then
was
the
best
she
could
manage
and
she
suddenly
let
go
her
hold
on
the
handle
peter
had
been
holding
on
to
it
too
firmly
and
pullingly
and
now
that
the
pull
the
other
way
was
suddenly
stopped
he
staggered
and
fell
over
backward
the
teeth
of
the
rake
between
his
feet
serve
you
right
said
bobbie
before
she
could
stop
herself
peter
lay
still
for
half
a
moment
long
enough
to
frighten
bobbie
a
little
then
he
frightened
her
a
little
more
for
he
sat
up
screamed
once
turned
rather
pale
and
then
lay
back
and
began
to
shriek
faintly
but
steadily
it
sounded
exactly
like
a
pig
being
killed
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
mother
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
and
it
was
half
a
minute
after
that
she
was
in
the
garden
kneeling
by
the
side
of
peter
who
never
for
an
instant
ceased
to
squeal
what
happened
bobbie
mother
asked
it
was
the
rake
said
phyllis
peter
was
pulling
at
it
so
was
bobbie
and
she
let
go
and
he
went
stop
that
noise
peter
said
mother
come
stop
at
peter
used
up
what
breath
he
had
left
in
a
last
squeal
and
stopped
now
said
mother
are
you
hurt
if
he
was
really
hurt
he
would
make
such
a
fuss
said
bobbie
still
trembling
with
fury
he
not
a
coward
i
think
my
foot
broken
off
that
all
said
peter
huffily
and
sat
up
then
he
turned
quite
white
mother
put
her
arm
round
him
he
is
hurt
she
said
he
fainted
here
bobbie
sit
down
and
take
his
head
on
your
then
mother
undid
peter
boots
as
she
took
the
right
one
off
something
dripped
from
his
foot
on
to
the
ground
it
was
red
blood
and
when
the
stocking
came
off
there
were
three
red
wounds
in
peter
foot
and
ankle
where
the
teeth
of
the
rake
had
bitten
him
and
his
foot
was
covered
with
red
smears
run
for
water
a
basinful
said
mother
and
phyllis
ran
she
upset
most
of
the
water
out
of
the
basin
in
her
haste
and
had
to
fetch
more
in
a
jug
peter
did
not
open
his
eyes
again
till
mother
had
tied
her
handkerchief
round
his
foot
and
she
and
bobbie
had
carried
him
in
and
laid
him
on
the
brown
wooden
settle
in
the
by
this
time
phyllis
was
halfway
to
the
doctor
mother
sat
by
peter
and
bathed
his
foot
and
talked
to
him
and
bobbie
went
out
and
got
tea
ready
and
put
on
the
kettle
it
all
i
can
do
she
told
herself
oh
suppose
peter
should
die
or
be
a
helpless
cripple
for
life
or
have
to
walk
with
crutches
or
wear
a
boot
with
a
sole
like
a
log
of
wood
she
stood
by
the
back
door
reflecting
on
these
gloomy
possibilities
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
i
wish
i
never
been
born
she
said
and
she
said
it
out
loud
why
lawk
a
mercy
what
that
for
asked
a
voice
and
perks
stood
before
her
with
a
wooden
trug
basket
full
of
things
and
soft
loose
earth
oh
it
you
she
said
peter
hurt
his
foot
with
a
rake
three
great
gaping
wounds
like
soldiers
get
and
it
was
partly
my
that
it
was
i
go
bail
said
perks
doctor
seen
him
phyllis
has
gone
for
the
he
be
all
right
you
see
if
he
is
said
perks
why
my
second
cousin
had
a
run
into
him
right
into
his
inside
and
he
was
right
as
ever
in
a
few
weeks
all
except
his
being
a
bit
weak
in
the
head
afterwards
and
they
did
say
that
it
was
along
of
his
getting
a
touch
of
the
sun
in
the
and
not
the
fork
at
all
i
remember
him
well
a
chap
but
soft
as
you
might
bobbie
tried
to
let
herself
be
cheered
by
this
heartening
reminiscence
well
said
perks
you
wo
want
to
be
bothered
with
gardening
just
this
minute
i
dare
say
you
show
me
where
your
garden
is
and
pop
the
bits
of
stuff
in
for
you
and
i
hang
about
if
i
may
make
so
free
to
see
the
doctor
as
he
comes
out
and
hear
what
he
says
you
cheer
up
missie
i
lay
a
pound
he
ai
hurt
not
to
speak
but
he
was
the
doctor
came
and
looked
at
the
foot
and
bandaged
it
beautifully
and
said
that
peter
must
not
put
it
to
the
ground
for
at
least
a
week
he
wo
be
lame
or
have
to
wear
crutches
or
a
lump
on
his
foot
will
he
whispered
bobbie
breathlessly
at
the
door
my
aunt
no
said
forrest
he
be
as
nimble
as
ever
on
his
pins
in
a
fortnight
do
you
worry
little
mother
it
was
when
mother
had
gone
to
the
gate
with
the
doctor
to
take
his
last
instructions
and
phyllis
was
filling
the
kettle
for
tea
that
peter
and
bobbie
found
themselves
alone
he
says
you
wo
be
lame
or
anything
said
bobbie
oh
course
i
sha
silly
said
peter
very
much
relieved
all
the
same
oh
peter
i
am
so
sorry
said
bobbie
after
a
pause
that
all
right
said
peter
gruffly
it
was
all
my
fault
said
bobbie
rot
said
peter
if
we
had
quarrelled
it
would
have
happened
i
knew
it
was
wrong
to
quarrel
i
wanted
to
say
so
but
somehow
i
do
drivel
said
peter
i
should
have
stopped
if
you
had
said
it
not
likely
and
besides
us
rowing
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
might
have
caught
my
foot
in
the
hoe
or
taken
off
my
fingers
in
the
machine
or
blown
my
nose
off
with
fireworks
it
would
have
been
hurt
just
the
same
whether
we
been
rowing
or
but
i
knew
it
was
wrong
to
quarrel
said
bobbie
in
tears
and
now
you
hurt
and
now
look
here
said
peter
firmly
you
just
dry
up
if
you
not
careful
you
turn
into
a
beastly
little
prig
so
i
tell
i
do
mean
to
be
a
prig
but
it
so
hard
not
to
be
when
really
trying
to
be
the
gentle
reader
may
perhaps
have
suffered
from
this
difficulty
not
it
said
peter
it
a
jolly
good
thing
it
was
you
was
hurt
i
glad
it
was
me
there
if
it
had
been
you
you
have
been
lying
on
the
sofa
looking
like
a
suffering
angel
and
being
the
light
of
the
anxious
household
and
all
that
and
i
could
have
stood
no
i
should
said
bobbie
yes
you
would
said
peter
i
tell
you
i
i
tell
you
you
oh
children
said
mother
voice
at
the
door
quarrelling
again
already
we
are
quarrelling
not
really
said
peter
i
wish
you
think
it
rows
every
time
we
do
agree
when
mother
had
gone
out
again
bobbie
broke
out
peter
i
am
sorry
you
hurt
but
you
are
a
beast
to
say
i
a
well
said
peter
unexpectedly
perhaps
i
am
you
did
say
i
was
a
coward
even
when
you
were
in
such
a
wax
the
only
thing
is
you
be
a
prig
that
all
you
keep
your
eyes
open
and
if
you
feel
priggishness
coming
on
just
stop
in
time
see
yes
said
bobbie
i
then
let
call
it
pax
said
peter
magnanimously
bury
the
hatchet
in
the
fathoms
of
the
past
shake
hands
on
it
i
say
bobbie
old
chap
i
am
he
was
tired
for
many
days
after
that
and
the
settle
seemed
hard
and
uncomfortable
in
spite
of
all
the
pillows
and
bolsters
and
soft
folded
rugs
it
was
terrible
not
to
be
able
to
go
out
they
moved
the
settle
to
the
window
and
from
there
peter
could
see
the
smoke
of
the
trains
winding
along
the
valley
but
he
could
not
see
the
trains
at
first
bobbie
found
it
quite
hard
to
be
as
nice
to
him
as
she
wanted
to
be
for
fear
he
should
think
her
priggish
but
that
soon
wore
off
and
both
she
and
phyllis
were
as
he
observed
jolly
good
sorts
mother
sat
with
him
when
his
sisters
were
out
and
the
words
he
not
a
coward
made
peter
determined
not
to
make
any
fuss
about
the
pain
in
his
foot
though
it
was
rather
bad
especially
at
night
praise
helps
people
very
much
sometimes
there
were
visitors
too
mrs
perks
came
up
to
ask
how
he
was
and
so
did
the
station
master
and
several
of
the
village
people
but
the
time
went
slowly
slowly
i
do
wish
there
was
something
to
read
said
peter
i
read
all
our
books
fifty
times
i
go
to
the
doctor
said
phyllis
he
sure
to
have
only
about
how
to
be
ill
and
about
people
nasty
insides
i
expect
said
peter
perks
has
a
whole
heap
of
magazines
that
came
out
of
trains
when
people
are
tired
of
them
said
bobbie
i
run
down
and
ask
so
the
girls
went
their
two
ways
bobbie
found
perks
busy
cleaning
lamps
and
how
the
young
gent
said
he
better
thanks
said
bobbie
but
he
most
frightfully
bored
i
came
to
ask
if
you
got
any
magazines
you
could
lend
there
now
said
perks
regretfully
rubbing
his
ear
with
a
black
and
oily
lump
of
cotton
waste
why
did
i
think
of
that
now
i
was
trying
to
think
of
something
as
amuse
him
only
this
morning
and
i
could
think
of
anything
better
than
a
and
a
young
chap
i
know
going
to
fetch
that
over
for
him
this
how
lovely
a
real
live
guinea
he
will
be
pleased
but
he
like
the
magazines
as
that
just
it
said
perks
i
just
sent
the
pick
of
to
snigson
boy
him
what
just
getting
over
the
pewmonia
but
i
lots
of
illustrated
papers
he
turned
to
the
pile
of
papers
in
the
corner
and
took
up
a
heap
six
inches
thick
there
he
said
i
just
slip
a
bit
of
string
and
a
bit
of
paper
round
he
pulled
an
old
newspaper
from
the
pile
and
spread
it
on
the
table
and
made
a
neat
parcel
of
it
there
said
he
there
lots
of
pictures
and
if
he
likes
to
mess
about
with
his
or
coloured
chalks
or
what
not
why
let
him
do
want
you
a
dear
said
bobbie
took
the
parcel
and
started
the
papers
were
heavy
and
when
she
had
to
wait
at
the
while
a
train
went
by
she
rested
the
parcel
on
the
top
of
the
gate
and
idly
she
looked
at
the
printing
on
the
paper
that
the
parcel
was
wrapped
in
suddenly
she
clutched
the
parcel
tighter
and
bent
her
head
over
it
it
seemed
like
some
horrible
dream
she
read
on
the
bottom
of
the
column
was
torn
off
she
could
read
no
farther
she
never
remembered
how
she
got
home
but
she
went
on
tiptoe
to
her
room
and
locked
the
door
then
she
undid
the
parcel
and
read
that
printed
column
again
sitting
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
her
hands
and
feet
icy
cold
and
her
face
burning
when
she
had
read
all
there
was
she
drew
a
long
uneven
breath
so
now
i
know
she
said
what
she
had
read
was
headed
of
the
trial
verdict
sentence
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
been
tried
was
the
name
of
her
father
the
verdict
was
and
the
sentence
was
years
penal
servitude
oh
daddy
she
whispered
crushing
the
paper
hard
it
not
true
i
do
believe
it
you
never
did
it
never
never
never
there
was
a
hammering
on
the
door
what
is
it
said
bobbie
it
me
said
the
voice
of
phyllis
tea
ready
and
a
boy
brought
peter
a
come
along
and
bobbie
had
to
chapter
xi
the
hound
in
the
red
jersey
bobbie
knew
the
secret
now
a
sheet
of
old
newspaper
wrapped
round
a
parcel
just
a
little
chance
like
that
had
given
the
secret
to
her
and
she
had
to
go
down
to
tea
and
pretend
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
the
pretence
was
bravely
made
but
it
was
very
successful
for
when
she
came
in
everyone
looked
up
from
tea
and
saw
her
eyes
and
her
pale
face
with
red
on
it
my
darling
cried
mother
jumping
up
from
the
whatever
is
the
matter
my
head
aches
rather
said
bobbie
and
indeed
it
did
has
anything
gone
wrong
mother
asked
i
all
right
really
said
bobbie
and
she
telegraphed
to
her
mother
from
her
swollen
eyes
this
brief
imploring
message
not
before
the
others
tea
was
not
a
cheerful
meal
peter
was
so
distressed
by
the
obvious
fact
that
something
horrid
had
happened
to
bobbie
that
he
limited
his
speech
to
repeating
more
bread
and
butter
please
at
startlingly
short
intervals
phyllis
stroked
her
sister
hand
under
the
table
to
express
sympathy
and
knocked
her
cup
over
as
she
did
it
fetching
a
cloth
and
wiping
up
the
spilt
milk
helped
bobbie
a
little
but
she
thought
that
tea
would
never
end
yet
at
last
it
did
end
as
all
things
do
at
last
and
when
mother
took
out
the
tray
bobbie
followed
her
she
gone
to
own
up
said
phyllis
to
peter
i
wonder
what
broken
something
i
suppose
said
peter
but
she
need
be
so
silly
over
it
mother
never
rows
for
accidents
listen
yes
they
going
upstairs
she
taking
mother
up
to
show
her
the
with
storks
on
it
i
expect
it
bobbie
in
the
kitchen
had
caught
hold
of
mother
hand
as
she
set
down
the
what
is
it
mother
asked
but
bobbie
only
said
come
upstairs
come
up
where
nobody
can
hear
when
she
had
got
mother
alone
in
her
room
she
locked
the
door
and
then
stood
quite
still
and
quite
without
words
all
through
tea
she
had
been
thinking
of
what
to
say
she
had
decided
that
i
know
all
or
all
is
known
to
me
or
the
terrible
secret
is
a
secret
no
longer
would
be
the
proper
thing
but
now
that
she
and
her
mother
and
that
awful
sheet
of
newspaper
were
alone
in
the
room
together
she
found
that
she
could
say
nothing
suddenly
she
went
to
mother
and
put
her
arms
round
her
and
began
to
cry
again
and
still
she
could
find
no
words
only
oh
mammy
oh
mammy
oh
mammy
over
and
over
again
mother
held
her
very
close
and
waited
suddenly
bobbie
broke
away
from
her
and
went
to
her
bed
from
under
her
mattress
she
pulled
out
the
paper
she
had
hidden
there
and
held
it
out
pointing
to
her
father
name
with
a
finger
that
shook
oh
bobbie
mother
cried
when
one
little
quick
look
had
shown
her
what
it
was
you
do
believe
it
you
do
believe
daddy
did
it
no
bobbie
almost
shouted
she
had
stopped
crying
that
all
right
said
mother
it
not
true
and
they
shut
him
up
in
prison
but
he
done
nothing
wrong
he
good
and
noble
and
honourable
and
he
belongs
to
us
we
have
to
think
of
that
and
be
proud
of
him
and
again
bobbie
clung
to
her
mother
and
again
only
one
word
came
to
her
but
now
that
word
was
daddy
and
oh
daddy
oh
daddy
oh
daddy
again
and
again
why
did
you
tell
me
mammy
she
asked
presently
are
you
going
to
tell
the
others
mother
asked
why
because
exactly
said
mother
so
you
understand
why
i
did
tell
you
we
two
must
help
each
other
to
be
yes
said
bobbie
mother
will
it
make
you
more
unhappy
if
you
tell
me
all
about
it
i
want
to
so
then
sitting
cuddled
up
close
to
her
mother
bobbie
heard
all
about
she
heard
how
those
men
who
had
asked
to
see
father
on
that
remembered
last
night
when
the
engine
was
being
mended
had
come
to
arrest
him
charging
him
with
selling
state
secrets
to
the
russians
with
being
in
fact
a
spy
and
a
traitor
she
heard
about
the
trial
and
about
the
evidence
letters
found
in
father
desk
at
the
office
letters
that
convinced
the
jury
that
father
was
guilty
oh
how
could
they
look
at
him
and
believe
it
cried
bobbie
and
how
could
any
one
do
such
a
thing
someone
did
it
said
mother
and
all
the
evidence
was
against
father
those
letters
yes
how
did
the
letters
get
into
his
desk
someone
put
them
there
and
the
person
who
put
them
there
was
the
person
who
was
really
he
must
be
feeling
pretty
awful
all
this
time
said
bobbie
thoughtfully
i
do
believe
he
had
any
feelings
mother
said
hotly
he
have
done
a
thing
like
that
if
he
perhaps
he
just
shoved
the
letters
into
the
desk
to
hide
them
when
he
thought
he
was
going
to
be
found
out
why
do
you
tell
the
lawyers
or
someone
that
it
must
have
been
that
person
there
was
anyone
that
would
have
hurt
father
on
purpose
was
there
i
do
know
i
do
know
the
man
under
him
who
got
daddy
place
when
he
when
the
awful
thing
happened
he
was
always
jealous
of
your
father
because
daddy
was
so
clever
and
everyone
thought
such
a
lot
of
him
and
daddy
never
quite
trusted
that
could
we
explain
all
that
to
someone
nobody
will
listen
said
mother
very
bitterly
nobody
at
all
do
you
suppose
i
not
tried
everything
no
my
dearest
there
nothing
to
be
done
all
we
can
do
you
and
i
and
daddy
is
to
be
brave
and
patient
and
she
spoke
very
softly
to
pray
bobbie
mother
you
got
very
thin
said
bobbie
abruptly
a
little
and
oh
said
bobbie
i
do
think
you
the
bravest
person
in
the
world
as
well
as
the
nicest
we
wo
talk
of
all
this
any
more
will
we
dear
said
mother
we
must
bear
it
and
be
brave
and
darling
try
not
to
think
of
it
try
to
be
cheerful
and
to
amuse
yourself
and
the
others
it
much
easier
for
me
if
you
can
be
a
little
bit
happy
and
enjoy
things
wash
your
poor
little
round
face
and
let
go
out
into
the
garden
for
a
the
other
two
were
very
gentle
and
kind
to
bobbie
and
they
did
not
ask
her
what
was
the
matter
this
was
peter
idea
and
he
had
drilled
phyllis
who
would
have
asked
a
hundred
questions
if
she
had
been
left
to
herself
a
week
later
bobbie
managed
to
get
away
alone
and
once
more
she
wrote
a
letter
and
once
more
it
was
to
the
old
gentleman
my
dear
friend
she
said
you
see
what
is
in
this
paper
it
is
not
true
father
never
did
it
mother
says
someone
put
the
papers
in
father
desk
and
she
says
the
man
under
him
that
got
father
place
afterwards
was
jealous
of
father
and
father
suspected
him
a
long
time
but
nobody
listens
to
a
word
she
says
but
you
are
so
good
and
clever
and
you
found
out
about
the
russian
gentleman
wife
directly
ca
you
find
out
who
did
the
treason
because
he
was
father
upon
my
honour
he
is
an
englishman
and
uncapable
to
do
such
things
and
then
they
would
let
father
out
of
prison
it
is
dreadful
and
mother
is
getting
so
thin
she
told
us
once
to
pray
for
all
prisoners
and
captives
i
see
now
oh
do
help
me
there
is
only
just
mother
and
me
know
and
we
ca
do
anything
peter
and
phil
do
know
i
pray
for
you
twice
every
day
as
long
as
i
live
if
you
only
try
just
try
to
find
out
think
if
it
was
your
daddy
what
you
would
feel
oh
do
do
do
help
me
with
love
i
remain
your
affectionately
little
friend
roberta
mother
would
send
her
kind
regards
if
she
knew
i
am
writing
but
it
is
no
use
telling
her
i
am
in
case
you
ca
do
anything
but
i
know
you
will
bobbie
with
best
she
cut
the
account
of
her
father
trial
out
of
the
newspaper
with
mother
big
scissors
and
put
it
in
the
envelope
with
her
letter
then
she
took
it
down
to
the
station
going
out
the
back
way
and
round
by
the
road
so
that
the
others
should
not
see
her
and
offer
to
come
with
her
and
she
gave
the
letter
to
the
station
master
to
give
to
the
old
gentleman
next
morning
where
have
you
been
shouted
peter
from
the
top
of
the
yard
wall
where
he
and
phyllis
were
to
the
station
of
course
said
bobbie
give
us
a
hand
she
set
her
foot
on
the
lock
of
the
yard
door
peter
reached
down
a
hand
what
on
earth
she
asked
as
she
reached
the
for
phyllis
and
peter
were
very
muddy
a
lump
of
wet
clay
lay
between
them
on
the
wall
they
had
each
a
slip
of
slate
in
a
very
dirty
hand
and
behind
peter
out
of
the
reach
of
accidents
were
several
strange
rounded
objects
rather
like
very
fat
sausages
hollow
but
closed
up
at
one
end
it
nests
said
peter
swallows
nests
we
going
to
dry
them
in
the
oven
and
hang
them
up
with
string
under
the
eaves
of
the
yes
said
phyllis
and
then
we
going
to
save
up
all
the
wool
and
hair
we
can
get
and
in
the
spring
we
line
them
and
then
how
pleased
the
swallows
will
be
i
often
thought
people
do
do
nearly
enough
for
dumb
animals
said
peter
with
an
air
of
virtue
i
do
think
people
might
have
thought
of
making
nests
for
poor
little
swallows
before
oh
said
bobbie
vaguely
if
everybody
thought
of
everything
be
nothing
left
for
anybody
else
to
think
look
at
the
nests
are
they
pretty
said
phyllis
reaching
across
peter
to
grasp
a
nest
look
out
phil
you
goat
said
her
brother
but
it
was
too
late
her
strong
little
fingers
had
crushed
the
nest
there
now
said
peter
never
mind
said
bobbie
it
is
one
of
my
own
said
phyllis
so
you
need
jaw
peter
yes
we
put
our
initial
names
on
the
ones
we
done
so
that
the
swallows
will
know
who
they
got
to
be
so
grateful
to
and
fond
swallows
ca
read
silly
said
peter
silly
yourself
retorted
phyllis
how
do
you
know
who
thought
of
making
the
nests
anyhow
shouted
peter
i
did
screamed
phyllis
nya
rejoined
peter
you
only
thought
of
making
hay
ones
and
sticking
them
in
the
ivy
for
the
sparrows
and
they
have
been
sopping
long
before
time
it
was
me
said
clay
and
i
do
care
what
you
look
said
bobbie
i
made
the
nest
all
right
again
give
me
the
bit
of
stick
to
mark
your
initial
name
on
it
but
how
can
you
your
letter
and
peter
are
the
same
for
peter
for
i
put
for
phyllis
said
the
child
of
that
name
that
how
it
sounds
the
swallows
would
spell
phyllis
with
a
they
ca
spell
at
all
peter
was
still
insisting
then
why
do
you
see
them
always
on
christmas
cards
and
valentines
with
letters
round
their
necks
how
would
they
know
where
to
go
if
they
could
read
that
only
in
pictures
you
never
saw
one
really
with
letters
round
its
well
i
have
a
pigeon
then
at
least
daddy
told
me
they
did
only
it
was
under
their
wings
and
not
round
their
necks
but
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
and
i
say
interrupted
bobbie
there
to
be
a
paperchase
who
peter
asked
grammar
school
perks
thinks
the
hare
will
go
along
by
the
line
at
first
we
might
go
along
the
cutting
you
can
see
a
long
way
from
the
paperchase
was
found
to
be
a
more
amusing
subject
of
conversation
than
the
reading
powers
of
swallows
bobbie
had
hoped
it
might
be
and
next
morning
mother
let
them
take
their
lunch
and
go
out
for
the
day
to
see
the
paperchase
if
we
go
to
the
cutting
said
peter
we
shall
see
the
workmen
even
if
we
miss
the
of
course
it
had
taken
some
time
to
get
the
line
clear
from
the
rocks
and
earth
and
trees
that
had
fallen
on
it
when
the
great
landslip
happened
that
was
the
occasion
you
will
remember
when
the
three
children
saved
the
train
from
being
wrecked
by
waving
six
little
flags
it
is
always
interesting
to
watch
people
working
especially
when
they
work
with
such
interesting
things
as
spades
and
picks
and
shovels
and
planks
and
barrows
when
they
have
cindery
red
fires
in
iron
pots
with
round
holes
in
them
and
red
lamps
hanging
near
the
works
at
night
of
course
the
children
were
never
out
at
night
but
once
at
dusk
when
peter
had
got
out
of
his
bedroom
skylight
on
to
the
roof
he
had
seen
the
red
lamp
shining
far
away
at
the
edge
of
the
cutting
the
children
had
often
been
down
to
watch
the
work
and
this
day
the
interest
of
picks
and
spades
and
barrows
being
wheeled
along
planks
completely
put
the
paperchase
out
of
their
heads
so
that
they
quite
jumped
when
a
voice
just
behind
them
panted
let
me
pass
it
was
the
hare
a
boy
with
dark
hair
lying
flat
on
a
very
damp
forehead
the
bag
of
torn
paper
under
his
arm
was
fastened
across
one
shoulder
by
a
strap
the
children
stood
back
the
hare
ran
along
the
line
and
the
workmen
leaned
on
their
picks
to
watch
him
he
ran
on
steadily
and
disappeared
into
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
that
against
the
said
the
foreman
why
worry
said
the
oldest
workman
live
and
let
live
what
i
always
say
ai
you
never
been
young
yourself
bates
i
ought
to
report
him
said
the
foreman
why
spoil
sport
what
i
always
passengers
are
forbidden
to
cross
the
line
on
any
pretence
murmured
the
foreman
doubtfully
he
ai
no
passenger
said
one
of
the
workmen
nor
ai
crossed
the
line
not
where
we
could
see
do
it
said
another
nor
yet
ai
made
no
pretences
said
a
third
and
said
the
oldest
workman
outer
sight
now
what
the
eye
do
see
the
need
take
no
notice
of
what
i
always
and
now
following
the
track
of
the
hare
by
the
little
white
blots
of
scattered
paper
came
the
hounds
there
were
thirty
of
them
and
they
all
came
down
the
steep
steps
by
ones
and
twos
and
threes
and
sixes
and
sevens
bobbie
and
phyllis
and
peter
counted
them
as
they
passed
the
foremost
ones
hesitated
a
moment
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
then
their
eyes
caught
the
gleam
of
scattered
whiteness
along
the
line
and
they
turned
towards
the
tunnel
and
by
ones
and
twos
and
threes
and
sixes
and
sevens
disappeared
in
the
dark
mouth
of
it
the
last
one
in
a
red
jersey
seemed
to
be
extinguished
by
the
darkness
like
a
candle
that
is
blown
out
they
do
know
what
they
in
for
said
the
foreman
it
is
so
easy
running
in
the
dark
the
tunnel
takes
two
or
three
they
take
a
long
time
to
get
through
you
think
peter
asked
an
hour
or
more
i
should
then
let
cut
across
the
top
and
see
them
come
out
at
the
other
end
said
peter
we
shall
get
there
long
before
they
the
counsel
seemed
good
and
they
went
they
climbed
the
steep
steps
from
which
they
had
picked
the
wild
cherry
blossom
for
the
grave
of
the
little
wild
rabbit
and
reaching
the
top
of
the
cutting
set
their
faces
towards
the
hill
through
which
the
tunnel
was
cut
it
was
stiff
work
it
like
alps
said
bobbie
breathlessly
or
andes
said
peter
it
like
himmy
what
its
names
gasped
phyllis
mount
everlasting
do
let
stick
to
it
panted
peter
you
get
your
second
wind
in
a
phyllis
consented
to
stick
to
it
and
on
they
went
running
when
the
turf
was
smooth
and
the
slope
easy
climbing
over
stones
helping
themselves
up
rocks
by
the
branches
of
trees
creeping
through
narrow
openings
between
tree
trunks
and
rocks
and
so
on
and
on
up
and
up
till
at
last
they
stood
on
the
very
top
of
the
hill
where
they
had
so
often
wished
to
be
halt
cried
peter
and
threw
himself
flat
on
the
grass
for
the
very
top
of
the
hill
was
a
smooth
turfed
dotted
with
mossy
rocks
and
little
trees
the
girls
also
threw
themselves
down
flat
plenty
of
time
peter
panted
the
rest
all
down
when
they
were
rested
enough
to
sit
up
and
look
round
them
bobbie
cried
oh
look
what
at
said
phyllis
the
view
said
bobbie
i
hate
views
said
phyllis
do
you
peter
let
get
on
said
peter
but
this
is
like
a
view
they
take
you
to
in
carriages
when
at
the
seaside
all
sea
and
sand
and
bare
hills
it
like
the
counties
in
one
of
mother
poetry
it
not
so
dusty
said
peter
look
at
the
aqueduct
straddling
slap
across
the
valley
like
a
giant
centipede
and
then
the
towns
sticking
their
church
spires
up
out
of
the
trees
like
pens
out
of
an
inkstand
think
it
more
like
there
could
he
see
the
banners
of
twelve
fair
cities
i
love
it
said
bobbie
it
worth
the
the
paperchase
is
worth
the
climb
said
phyllis
if
we
do
lose
it
let
get
on
it
all
down
hill
said
that
ten
minutes
ago
said
peter
well
i
said
it
now
said
phyllis
come
loads
of
time
said
peter
and
there
was
for
when
they
had
got
down
to
a
level
with
the
top
of
the
tunnel
mouth
they
were
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
out
of
their
reckoning
and
had
to
creep
along
the
face
of
the
hill
there
was
no
sign
of
the
hare
or
the
hounds
they
gone
long
ago
of
course
said
phyllis
as
they
leaned
on
the
brick
parapet
above
the
tunnel
i
do
think
so
said
bobbie
but
even
if
they
had
it
ripping
here
and
we
shall
see
the
trains
come
out
of
the
tunnel
like
dragons
out
of
lairs
we
never
seen
that
from
the
top
side
no
more
we
have
said
phyllis
partially
appeased
it
was
really
a
most
exciting
place
to
be
in
the
top
of
the
tunnel
seemed
ever
so
much
farther
from
the
line
than
they
had
expected
and
it
was
like
being
on
a
bridge
but
a
bridge
overgrown
with
bushes
and
creepers
and
grass
and
i
know
the
paperchase
has
gone
long
ago
said
phyllis
every
two
minutes
and
she
hardly
knew
whether
she
was
pleased
or
disappointed
when
peter
leaning
over
the
parapet
suddenly
cried
look
out
here
he
comes
they
all
leaned
over
the
brick
wall
in
time
to
see
the
hare
going
very
slowly
come
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
tunnel
there
now
said
peter
what
did
i
tell
you
now
for
the
hounds
very
soon
came
the
hounds
by
ones
and
twos
and
threes
and
sixes
and
sevens
and
they
also
were
going
slowly
and
seemed
very
tired
two
or
three
who
lagged
far
behind
came
out
long
after
the
others
there
said
bobbie
that
all
now
what
shall
we
do
go
along
into
the
tulgy
wood
over
there
and
have
lunch
said
phyllis
we
can
see
them
for
miles
from
up
not
yet
said
peter
that
not
the
last
there
the
one
in
the
red
jersey
to
come
yet
let
see
the
last
of
them
come
but
though
they
waited
and
waited
and
waited
the
boy
in
the
red
jersey
did
not
appear
oh
let
have
lunch
said
phyllis
i
got
a
pain
in
my
front
with
being
so
hungry
you
must
have
missed
seeing
the
one
when
he
came
out
with
the
others
but
bobbie
and
peter
agreed
that
he
had
not
come
out
with
the
others
let
get
down
to
the
tunnel
mouth
said
peter
then
perhaps
we
shall
see
him
coming
along
from
the
inside
i
expect
he
felt
and
rested
in
one
of
the
manholes
you
stay
up
here
and
watch
bob
and
when
i
signal
from
below
you
come
down
we
might
miss
seeing
him
on
the
way
down
with
all
these
so
the
others
climbed
down
and
bobbie
waited
till
they
signalled
to
her
from
the
line
below
and
then
she
too
scrambled
down
the
roundabout
slippery
path
among
roots
and
moss
till
she
stepped
out
between
two
dogwood
trees
and
joined
the
others
on
the
line
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
the
hound
with
the
red
jersey
oh
do
do
let
have
something
to
eat
wailed
phyllis
i
shall
die
if
you
do
and
then
you
be
give
her
the
sandwiches
for
goodness
sake
and
stop
her
silly
mouth
said
peter
not
quite
unkindly
look
here
he
added
turning
to
bobbie
perhaps
we
better
have
one
each
too
we
may
need
all
our
strength
not
more
than
one
though
there
no
what
asked
bobbie
her
mouth
already
full
for
she
was
just
as
hungry
as
phyllis
do
you
see
replied
peter
impressively
that
hound
has
had
an
accident
that
what
it
is
perhaps
even
as
we
speak
lying
with
his
head
on
the
metals
an
unresisting
prey
to
any
passing
express
oh
do
try
to
talk
like
a
book
cried
bobbie
bolting
what
was
left
of
her
sandwich
come
on
phil
keep
close
behind
me
and
if
a
train
comes
stand
flat
against
the
tunnel
wall
and
hold
your
petticoats
close
to
give
me
one
more
sandwich
pleaded
phyllis
and
i
i
going
first
said
peter
it
was
my
idea
and
he
went
of
course
you
know
what
going
into
a
tunnel
is
like
the
engine
gives
a
scream
and
then
suddenly
the
noise
of
the
running
rattling
train
changes
and
grows
different
and
much
louder
people
pull
up
the
windows
and
hold
them
by
the
strap
the
railway
carriage
suddenly
grows
like
night
with
lamps
of
course
unless
you
are
in
a
slow
local
train
in
which
case
lamps
are
not
always
provided
then
by
and
by
the
darkness
outside
the
carriage
window
is
touched
by
puffs
of
cloudy
whiteness
then
you
see
a
blue
light
on
the
walls
of
the
tunnel
then
the
sound
of
the
moving
train
changes
once
more
and
you
are
out
in
the
good
open
air
again
and
let
the
straps
go
the
windows
all
dim
with
the
yellow
breath
of
the
tunnel
rattle
down
into
their
places
and
you
see
once
more
the
dip
and
catch
of
the
telegraph
wires
beside
the
line
and
the
hawthorn
hedges
with
the
tiny
baby
trees
growing
up
out
of
them
every
thirty
yards
all
this
of
course
is
what
a
tunnel
means
when
you
are
in
a
train
but
everything
is
quite
different
when
you
walk
into
a
tunnel
on
your
own
feet
and
tread
on
shifting
sliding
stones
and
gravel
on
a
path
that
curves
downwards
from
the
shining
metals
to
the
wall
then
you
see
slimy
oozy
trickles
of
water
running
down
the
inside
of
the
tunnel
and
you
notice
that
the
bricks
are
not
red
or
brown
as
they
are
at
the
tunnel
mouth
but
dull
sticky
sickly
green
your
voice
when
you
speak
is
quite
changed
from
what
it
was
out
in
the
sunshine
and
it
is
a
long
time
before
the
tunnel
is
quite
dark
it
was
not
yet
quite
dark
in
the
tunnel
when
phyllis
caught
at
skirt
ripping
out
half
a
yard
of
gathers
but
no
one
noticed
this
at
the
time
i
want
to
go
back
she
said
i
do
like
it
it
be
pitch
dark
in
a
minute
i
wo
go
on
in
the
dark
i
do
care
what
you
say
i
do
be
a
silly
cuckoo
said
peter
i
got
a
candle
end
and
matches
and
what
that
that
was
a
low
humming
sound
on
the
railway
line
a
trembling
of
the
wires
beside
it
a
buzzing
humming
sound
that
grew
louder
and
louder
as
they
listened
it
a
train
said
bobbie
which
line
let
me
go
back
cried
phyllis
struggling
to
get
away
from
the
hand
by
which
bobbie
held
her
do
be
a
coward
said
bobbie
it
quite
safe
stand
come
on
shouted
peter
who
was
a
few
yards
ahead
quick
manhole
the
roar
of
the
advancing
train
was
now
louder
than
the
noise
you
hear
when
your
head
is
under
water
in
the
bath
and
both
taps
are
running
and
you
are
kicking
with
your
heels
against
the
bath
tin
sides
but
peter
had
shouted
for
all
he
was
worth
and
bobbie
heard
him
she
dragged
phyllis
along
to
the
manhole
phyllis
of
course
stumbled
over
the
wires
and
grazed
both
her
legs
but
they
dragged
her
in
and
all
three
stood
in
the
dark
damp
arched
recess
while
the
train
roared
louder
and
louder
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
deafen
them
and
in
the
distance
they
could
see
its
eyes
of
fire
growing
bigger
and
brighter
every
instant
it
is
a
dragon
i
always
knew
it
was
it
takes
its
own
shape
in
here
in
the
dark
shouted
phyllis
but
nobody
heard
her
you
see
the
train
was
shouting
too
and
its
voice
was
bigger
than
hers
and
now
with
a
rush
and
a
roar
and
a
rattle
and
a
long
dazzling
flash
of
lighted
carriage
windows
a
smell
of
smoke
and
blast
of
hot
air
the
train
hurtled
by
clanging
and
jangling
and
echoing
in
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
tunnel
phyllis
and
bobbie
clung
to
each
other
even
peter
caught
hold
of
bobbie
arm
in
case
she
should
be
frightened
as
he
explained
afterwards
and
now
slowly
and
gradually
the
grew
smaller
and
smaller
and
so
did
the
noise
till
with
one
last
whiz
the
train
got
itself
out
of
the
tunnel
and
silence
settled
again
on
its
damp
walls
and
dripping
roof
oh
said
the
children
all
together
in
a
whisper
peter
was
lighting
the
candle
end
with
a
hand
that
trembled
come
on
he
said
but
he
had
to
clear
his
throat
before
he
could
speak
in
his
natural
voice
oh
said
phyllis
if
the
one
was
in
the
way
of
the
train
we
got
to
go
and
see
said
peter
could
we
go
and
send
someone
from
the
station
said
phyllis
would
you
rather
wait
here
for
us
asked
bobbie
severely
and
of
course
that
settled
the
question
so
the
three
went
on
into
the
deeper
darkness
of
the
tunnel
peter
led
holding
his
candle
end
high
to
light
the
way
the
grease
ran
down
his
fingers
and
some
of
it
right
up
his
sleeve
he
found
a
long
streak
from
wrist
to
elbow
when
he
went
to
bed
that
night
it
was
not
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
from
the
spot
where
they
had
stood
while
the
train
went
by
that
peter
stood
still
shouted
hullo
and
then
went
on
much
quicker
than
before
when
the
others
caught
him
up
he
stopped
and
he
stopped
within
a
yard
of
what
they
had
come
into
the
tunnel
to
look
for
phyllis
saw
a
gleam
of
red
and
shut
her
eyes
tight
there
by
the
curved
pebbly
down
line
was
the
hound
his
back
was
against
the
wall
his
arms
hung
limply
by
his
sides
and
his
eyes
were
shut
was
the
red
blood
is
he
all
killed
asked
phyllis
screwing
her
eyelids
more
tightly
together
killed
nonsense
said
peter
there
nothing
red
about
him
except
his
jersey
he
only
fainted
what
on
earth
are
we
to
do
can
we
move
him
asked
bobbie
i
do
know
he
a
big
suppose
we
bathe
his
forehead
with
water
no
i
know
we
have
any
but
milk
just
as
wet
there
a
whole
yes
said
peter
and
they
rub
people
hands
i
they
burn
feathers
i
know
said
phyllis
what
the
good
of
saying
that
when
we
have
any
feathers
as
it
happens
said
phyllis
in
a
tone
of
exasperated
triumph
got
a
shuttlecock
in
my
pocket
so
there
and
now
peter
rubbed
the
hands
of
the
one
bobbie
burned
the
feathers
of
the
shuttlecock
one
by
one
under
his
nose
phyllis
splashed
warmish
milk
on
his
forehead
and
all
three
kept
on
saying
as
fast
and
as
earnestly
as
they
could
oh
look
up
speak
to
me
for
my
sake
speak
chapter
xii
what
bobbie
brought
home
oh
look
up
speak
to
me
for
my
sake
speak
the
children
said
the
words
over
and
over
again
to
the
unconscious
hound
in
a
red
jersey
who
sat
with
closed
eyes
and
pale
face
against
the
side
of
the
tunnel
wet
his
ears
with
milk
said
bobbie
i
know
they
do
it
to
people
that
faint
with
but
i
expect
milk
just
as
so
they
wetted
his
ears
and
some
of
the
milk
ran
down
his
neck
under
the
red
jersey
it
was
very
dark
in
the
tunnel
the
candle
end
peter
had
carried
and
which
now
burned
on
a
flat
stone
gave
hardly
any
light
at
all
oh
do
look
up
said
phyllis
for
my
sake
i
believe
he
for
my
sake
repeated
bobbie
no
he
for
any
sake
said
peter
come
out
of
and
he
shook
the
sufferer
by
the
arm
and
then
the
boy
in
the
red
jersey
sighed
and
opened
his
eyes
and
shut
them
again
and
said
in
a
very
small
voice
chuck
oh
he
not
dead
said
phyllis
i
knew
he
was
and
she
began
to
cry
what
up
i
all
right
said
the
boy
drink
this
said
peter
firmly
thrusting
the
nose
of
the
milk
bottle
into
the
boy
mouth
the
boy
struggled
and
some
of
the
milk
was
upset
before
he
could
get
his
mouth
free
to
say
what
is
it
it
milk
said
peter
fear
not
you
are
in
the
hands
of
friends
phil
you
stop
bleating
this
do
drink
it
said
bobbie
gently
it
do
you
so
he
drank
and
the
three
stood
by
without
speaking
to
him
let
him
be
a
minute
peter
whispered
he
be
all
right
as
soon
as
the
milk
begins
to
run
like
fire
through
his
he
was
i
better
now
he
announced
i
remember
all
about
he
tried
to
move
but
the
movement
ended
in
a
groan
bother
i
believe
i
broken
my
leg
he
said
did
you
tumble
down
asked
phyllis
sniffing
of
course
not
i
not
a
kiddie
said
the
boy
indignantly
it
was
one
of
those
beastly
wires
tripped
me
up
and
when
i
tried
to
get
up
again
i
could
stand
so
i
sat
down
gee
whillikins
it
does
hurt
though
how
did
you
get
here
we
saw
you
all
go
into
the
tunnel
and
then
we
went
across
the
hill
to
see
you
all
come
out
and
the
others
did
all
but
you
and
you
did
so
we
are
a
rescue
party
said
peter
with
pride
you
got
some
pluck
i
will
say
remarked
the
boy
oh
that
nothing
said
peter
with
modesty
do
you
think
you
could
walk
if
we
helped
you
i
could
try
said
the
boy
he
did
try
but
he
could
only
stand
on
one
foot
the
other
dragged
in
a
very
nasty
way
here
let
me
sit
down
i
feel
like
dying
said
the
boy
let
go
of
me
let
go
quick
he
lay
down
and
closed
his
eyes
the
others
looked
at
each
other
by
the
dim
light
of
the
little
candle
what
on
earth
said
peter
look
here
said
bobbie
quickly
you
must
go
and
get
help
go
to
the
nearest
yes
that
the
only
thing
said
peter
come
if
you
take
his
feet
and
phil
and
i
take
his
head
we
could
carry
him
to
the
they
did
it
it
was
perhaps
as
well
for
the
sufferer
that
he
had
fainted
again
now
said
bobbie
i
stay
with
him
you
take
the
longest
bit
of
candle
and
oh
be
quick
for
this
bit
wo
burn
i
do
think
mother
would
like
me
leaving
you
said
peter
doubtfully
let
me
stay
and
you
and
phil
no
no
said
bobbie
you
and
phil
go
and
lend
me
your
knife
try
to
get
his
boot
off
before
he
wakes
up
i
hope
it
all
right
what
we
doing
said
peter
of
course
it
right
said
bobbie
impatiently
what
else
would
you
do
leave
him
here
all
alone
because
it
dark
nonsense
hurry
up
that
so
they
hurried
up
bobbie
watched
their
dark
figures
and
the
little
light
of
the
little
candle
with
an
odd
feeling
of
having
come
to
the
end
of
everything
she
knew
now
she
thought
what
nuns
who
were
bricked
up
alive
in
convent
walls
felt
like
suddenly
she
gave
herself
a
little
shake
do
be
a
silly
little
girl
she
said
she
was
always
very
angry
when
anyone
else
called
her
a
little
girl
even
if
the
adjective
that
went
first
was
not
silly
but
nice
or
good
or
and
it
was
only
when
she
was
very
angry
with
herself
that
she
allowed
roberta
to
use
that
expression
to
bobbie
she
fixed
the
little
candle
end
on
a
broken
brick
near
the
boy
feet
then
she
opened
peter
knife
it
was
always
hard
to
manage
a
halfpenny
was
generally
needed
to
get
it
open
at
all
this
time
bobbie
somehow
got
it
open
with
her
thumbnail
she
broke
the
nail
and
it
hurt
horribly
then
she
cut
the
boy
bootlace
and
got
the
boot
off
she
tried
to
pull
off
his
stocking
but
his
leg
was
dreadfully
swollen
and
it
did
not
seem
to
be
the
proper
shape
so
she
cut
the
stocking
down
very
slowly
and
carefully
it
was
a
brown
knitted
stocking
and
she
wondered
who
had
knitted
it
and
whether
it
was
the
boy
mother
and
whether
she
was
feeling
anxious
about
him
and
how
she
would
feel
when
he
was
brought
home
with
his
leg
broken
when
bobbie
had
got
the
stocking
off
and
saw
the
poor
leg
she
felt
as
though
the
tunnel
was
growing
darker
and
the
ground
felt
unsteady
and
nothing
seemed
quite
real
silly
little
girl
said
roberta
to
bobbie
and
felt
better
the
poor
leg
she
told
herself
it
ought
to
have
a
cushion
ah
she
remembered
the
day
when
she
and
phyllis
had
torn
up
their
red
flannel
petticoats
to
make
danger
signals
to
stop
the
train
and
prevent
an
accident
her
flannel
petticoat
was
white
but
it
would
be
quite
as
soft
as
a
red
one
she
took
it
off
oh
what
useful
things
flannel
petticoats
are
she
said
the
man
who
invented
them
ought
to
have
a
statue
directed
to
and
she
said
it
aloud
because
it
seemed
that
any
voice
even
her
own
would
be
a
comfort
in
that
darkness
what
ought
to
be
directed
who
to
asked
the
boy
suddenly
and
very
feebly
oh
said
bobbie
now
you
better
hold
your
teeth
and
do
let
it
hurt
too
much
now
she
had
folded
the
petticoat
and
lifting
his
leg
laid
it
on
the
cushion
of
folded
flannel
do
faint
again
please
do
said
bobbie
as
he
groaned
she
hastily
wetted
her
handkerchief
with
milk
and
spread
it
over
the
poor
leg
oh
that
hurts
cried
the
boy
shrinking
oh
no
it
does
nice
what
your
name
said
bobbie
mine
but
you
a
girl
are
you
yes
my
long
name
i
say
yes
was
there
some
more
of
you
just
now
yes
peter
and
phil
that
my
brother
and
sister
they
gone
to
get
someone
to
carry
you
what
rum
names
all
yes
i
wish
i
was
a
boy
do
you
i
think
you
all
right
as
you
i
did
mean
that
i
meant
do
you
wish
you
were
a
boy
but
of
course
you
are
without
you
just
as
brave
as
a
boy
why
did
you
go
with
the
others
somebody
had
to
stay
with
you
said
bobbie
tell
you
what
bobbie
said
jim
you
a
brick
he
reached
out
a
arm
and
bobbie
squeezed
his
hand
i
wo
shake
it
she
explained
because
it
would
shake
you
and
that
would
shake
your
poor
leg
and
that
would
hurt
have
you
got
a
hanky
i
do
expect
i
he
felt
in
his
pocket
yes
i
have
what
for
she
took
it
and
wetted
it
with
milk
and
put
it
on
his
forehead
that
jolly
he
said
what
is
it
milk
said
bobbie
we
have
any
water
you
a
jolly
good
little
nurse
said
jim
i
do
it
for
mother
sometimes
said
bobbie
not
milk
of
course
but
scent
or
vinegar
and
water
i
say
i
must
put
the
candle
out
now
because
there
may
be
enough
of
the
other
one
to
get
you
out
by
george
said
he
you
think
of
bobbie
blew
out
went
the
candle
you
have
no
idea
how
the
darkness
was
i
say
bobbie
said
a
voice
through
the
blackness
are
you
afraid
of
the
dark
not
not
very
that
is
let
hold
hands
said
the
boy
and
it
was
really
rather
good
of
him
because
he
was
like
most
boys
of
his
age
and
hated
all
material
tokens
of
affection
such
as
kissing
and
holding
of
hands
he
called
all
such
things
pawings
and
detested
them
the
darkness
was
more
bearable
to
bobbie
now
that
her
hand
was
held
in
the
large
rough
hand
of
the
sufferer
and
he
holding
her
little
smooth
hot
paw
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
did
not
mind
it
so
much
as
he
expected
she
tried
to
talk
to
amuse
him
and
take
his
mind
off
his
sufferings
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
go
on
talking
in
the
dark
and
presently
they
found
themselves
in
a
silence
only
broken
now
and
then
by
a
you
all
right
bobbie
or
an
i
afraid
it
hurting
you
most
awfully
jim
i
am
so
and
it
was
very
cold
peter
and
phyllis
tramped
down
the
long
way
of
the
tunnel
towards
daylight
the
dripping
over
peter
fingers
there
were
no
accidents
unless
you
count
phyllis
catching
her
frock
on
a
wire
and
tearing
a
long
jagged
slit
in
it
and
tripping
over
her
bootlace
when
it
came
undone
or
going
down
on
her
hands
and
knees
all
four
of
which
were
grazed
there
no
end
to
this
tunnel
said
phyllis
and
indeed
it
did
seem
very
very
long
stick
to
it
said
peter
everything
has
an
end
and
you
get
to
it
if
you
only
keep
all
which
is
quite
true
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
and
a
useful
thing
to
remember
in
seasons
of
trouble
such
as
measles
arithmetic
impositions
and
those
times
when
you
are
in
disgrace
and
feel
as
though
no
one
would
ever
love
you
again
and
you
could
never
never
again
love
anybody
hurray
said
peter
suddenly
there
the
end
of
the
tunnel
looks
just
like
a
in
a
bit
of
black
paper
does
it
the
got
larger
blue
lights
lay
along
the
sides
of
the
tunnel
the
children
could
see
the
gravel
way
that
lay
in
front
of
them
the
air
grew
warmer
and
sweeter
another
twenty
steps
and
they
were
out
in
the
good
glad
sunshine
with
the
green
trees
on
both
sides
phyllis
drew
a
long
breath
i
never
go
into
a
tunnel
again
as
long
as
ever
i
live
said
she
not
if
there
are
twenty
hundred
thousand
millions
hounds
inside
with
red
jerseys
and
their
legs
do
be
a
silly
cuckoo
said
peter
as
usual
you
have
i
think
it
was
very
brave
and
good
of
me
said
phyllis
not
it
said
peter
you
did
go
because
you
were
brave
but
because
bobbie
and
i
are
skunks
now
where
the
nearest
house
i
wonder
you
ca
see
anything
here
for
the
there
a
roof
over
there
said
phyllis
pointing
down
the
line
that
the
said
peter
and
you
know
you
not
allowed
to
speak
to
signalmen
on
duty
it
i
not
near
so
afraid
of
doing
wrong
as
i
was
of
going
into
that
tunnel
said
phyllis
come
on
and
she
started
to
run
along
the
line
so
peter
ran
too
it
was
very
hot
in
the
sunshine
and
both
children
were
hot
and
breathless
by
the
time
they
stopped
and
bending
their
heads
back
to
look
up
at
the
open
windows
of
the
shouted
hi
as
loud
as
their
breathless
state
allowed
but
no
one
answered
the
stood
quiet
as
an
empty
nursery
and
the
handrail
of
its
steps
was
hot
to
the
hands
of
the
children
as
they
climbed
softly
up
they
peeped
in
at
the
open
door
the
signalman
was
sitting
on
a
chair
tilted
back
against
the
wall
his
head
leaned
sideways
and
his
mouth
was
open
he
was
fast
asleep
my
hat
cried
peter
wake
up
and
he
cried
it
in
a
terrible
voice
for
he
knew
that
if
a
signalman
sleeps
on
duty
he
risks
losing
his
situation
let
alone
all
the
other
dreadful
risks
to
trains
which
expect
him
to
tell
them
when
it
is
safe
for
them
to
go
their
ways
the
signalman
never
moved
then
peter
sprang
to
him
and
shook
him
and
slowly
yawning
and
stretching
the
man
awoke
but
the
moment
he
was
awake
he
leapt
to
his
feet
put
his
hands
to
his
head
like
a
mad
maniac
as
phyllis
said
afterwards
and
shouted
oh
my
heavens
what
twelve
thirteen
said
peter
and
indeed
it
was
by
the
clock
on
the
wall
of
the
the
man
looked
at
the
clock
sprang
to
the
levers
and
wrenched
them
this
way
and
that
an
electric
bell
tingled
the
wires
and
cranks
creaked
and
the
man
threw
himself
into
a
chair
he
was
very
pale
and
the
sweat
stood
on
his
forehead
like
large
dewdrops
on
a
white
cabbage
as
phyllis
remarked
later
he
was
trembling
too
the
children
could
see
his
big
hairy
hands
shake
from
side
to
side
with
quite
trembles
to
use
the
subsequent
words
of
peter
he
drew
long
breaths
then
suddenly
he
cried
thank
god
thank
god
you
come
in
when
you
did
oh
thank
god
and
his
shoulders
began
to
heave
and
his
face
grew
red
again
and
he
hid
it
in
those
large
hairy
hands
of
his
oh
do
cry
do
said
phyllis
it
all
right
now
and
she
patted
him
on
one
big
broad
shoulder
while
peter
conscientiously
thumped
the
other
but
the
signalman
seemed
quite
broken
down
and
the
children
had
to
pat
him
and
thump
him
for
quite
a
long
time
before
he
found
his
handkerchief
a
red
one
with
mauve
and
white
horseshoes
on
it
and
mopped
his
face
and
spoke
during
this
patting
and
thumping
interval
a
train
thundered
by
i
downright
shamed
that
i
am
were
the
words
of
the
big
signalman
when
he
had
stopped
crying
snivelling
like
a
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
get
cross
and
what
was
you
doing
up
here
anyway
he
said
you
know
it
ai
yes
said
phyllis
we
knew
it
was
wrong
but
i
was
afraid
of
doing
wrong
and
so
it
turned
out
right
you
are
sorry
we
lor
love
you
if
you
had
come
he
stopped
and
then
went
on
it
a
disgrace
so
it
is
sleeping
on
duty
if
it
was
to
come
to
be
known
even
as
it
is
when
no
harm
come
of
it
wo
come
to
be
known
said
peter
we
are
sneaks
all
the
same
you
ought
to
sleep
on
duty
it
tell
me
something
i
do
know
said
the
man
but
i
ca
help
it
i
know
well
enough
just
how
it
be
but
i
could
get
off
they
could
get
no
one
to
take
on
my
duty
i
tell
you
i
ai
had
ten
minutes
sleep
this
last
five
days
my
little
chap
ill
pewmonia
the
doctor
says
and
there
no
one
but
me
and
little
sister
to
do
for
him
that
where
it
is
the
gell
must
her
sleep
dangerous
yes
i
believe
you
now
go
and
split
on
me
if
you
of
course
we
wo
said
peter
indignantly
but
phyllis
ignored
the
whole
of
the
signalman
speech
except
the
first
six
words
you
asked
us
she
said
to
tell
you
something
you
do
know
well
i
will
there
a
boy
in
the
tunnel
over
there
with
a
red
jersey
and
his
leg
what
did
he
want
to
go
into
the
blooming
tunnel
for
then
said
the
man
do
you
be
so
cross
said
phyllis
kindly
we
have
done
anything
wrong
except
coming
and
waking
you
up
and
that
was
right
as
it
then
peter
told
how
the
boy
came
to
be
in
the
tunnel
well
said
the
man
i
do
see
as
i
can
do
anything
i
ca
leave
the
you
might
tell
us
where
to
go
after
someone
who
is
in
a
box
though
said
phyllis
there
brigden
farm
over
yonder
where
you
see
the
smoke
up
through
the
trees
said
the
man
more
and
more
grumpy
as
phyllis
noticed
well
then
said
peter
but
the
man
said
wait
a
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
some
money
a
lot
of
pennies
and
one
or
two
shillings
and
sixpences
and
he
picked
out
two
shillings
and
held
them
out
here
he
said
i
give
you
this
to
hold
your
tongues
about
taken
place
there
was
a
short
unpleasant
pause
then
you
are
a
nasty
man
though
are
you
said
phyllis
peter
took
a
step
forward
and
knocked
the
man
hand
up
so
that
the
shillings
leapt
out
of
it
and
rolled
on
the
floor
if
anything
could
make
me
sneak
that
would
he
said
come
phil
and
marched
out
of
the
with
flaming
cheeks
phyllis
hesitated
then
she
took
the
hand
still
held
out
stupidly
that
the
shillings
had
been
in
i
forgive
you
she
said
even
if
peter
does
you
not
in
your
proper
senses
or
you
never
have
done
that
i
know
want
of
sleep
sends
people
mad
mother
told
me
i
hope
your
little
boy
will
soon
be
better
and
come
on
phil
cried
peter
eagerly
i
give
you
my
sacred
we
never
tell
anyone
kiss
and
be
friends
said
phyllis
feeling
how
noble
it
was
of
her
to
try
to
make
up
a
quarrel
in
which
she
was
not
to
blame
the
signalman
stooped
and
kissed
her
i
do
believe
i
a
bit
off
my
head
sissy
he
said
now
run
along
home
to
mother
i
did
mean
to
put
you
about
so
phil
left
the
hot
and
followed
peter
across
the
fields
to
the
farm
when
the
farm
men
led
by
peter
and
phyllis
and
carrying
a
hurdle
covered
with
reached
the
manhole
in
the
tunnel
bobbie
was
fast
asleep
and
so
was
jim
worn
out
with
the
pain
the
doctor
said
afterwards
where
does
he
live
the
bailiff
from
the
farm
asked
when
jim
had
been
lifted
on
to
the
hurdle
in
northumberland
answered
bobbie
i
at
school
at
maidbridge
said
jim
i
suppose
i
got
to
get
back
there
seems
to
me
the
doctor
ought
to
have
a
look
in
first
said
the
bailiff
oh
bring
him
up
to
our
house
said
bobbie
it
only
a
little
way
by
the
road
i
sure
mother
would
say
we
ought
will
your
ma
like
you
bringing
home
strangers
with
broken
legs
she
took
the
poor
russian
home
herself
said
bobbie
i
know
she
say
we
all
right
said
the
bailiff
you
ought
to
know
what
your
ma
like
i
would
take
it
upon
me
to
fetch
him
up
to
our
place
without
i
asked
the
missus
first
and
they
call
me
the
master
are
you
sure
your
mother
wo
mind
whispered
jim
certain
said
bobbie
then
we
to
take
him
up
to
three
chimneys
said
the
bailiff
of
course
said
peter
then
my
lad
shall
nip
up
to
doctor
on
his
bike
and
tell
him
to
come
down
there
now
lads
lift
him
quiet
and
steady
one
two
three
thus
it
happened
that
mother
writing
away
for
dear
life
at
a
story
about
a
duchess
a
designing
villain
a
secret
passage
and
a
missing
will
dropped
her
pen
as
her
door
burst
open
and
turned
to
see
bobbie
hatless
and
red
with
running
oh
mother
she
cried
do
come
down
we
found
a
hound
in
a
red
jersey
in
the
tunnel
and
he
broken
his
leg
and
they
bringing
him
they
ought
to
take
him
to
the
vet
said
mother
with
a
worried
frown
i
really
ca
have
a
lame
dog
he
not
a
dog
really
he
a
boy
said
bobbie
between
laughing
and
choking
then
he
ought
to
be
taken
home
to
his
his
mother
dead
said
bobbie
and
his
father
in
northumberland
oh
mother
you
will
be
nice
to
him
i
told
him
i
was
sure
you
want
us
to
bring
him
home
you
always
want
to
help
mother
smiled
but
she
sighed
too
it
is
nice
that
your
children
should
believe
you
willing
to
open
house
and
heart
to
any
and
every
one
who
needs
help
but
it
is
rather
embarrassing
sometimes
too
when
they
act
on
their
belief
oh
well
said
mother
we
must
make
the
best
of
when
jim
was
carried
in
dreadfully
white
and
with
set
lips
whose
red
had
faded
to
a
horrid
bluey
violet
colour
mother
said
i
am
glad
you
brought
him
here
now
jim
let
get
you
comfortable
in
bed
before
the
doctor
comes
and
jim
looking
at
her
kind
eyes
felt
a
little
warm
comforting
flush
of
new
courage
it
hurt
rather
wo
it
he
said
i
do
mean
to
be
a
coward
you
wo
think
i
a
coward
if
i
faint
again
will
you
i
really
and
truly
do
do
it
on
purpose
and
i
do
hate
to
give
you
all
this
do
you
worry
said
mother
it
you
that
have
the
trouble
you
poor
dear
not
and
she
kissed
him
just
as
if
he
had
been
peter
we
love
to
have
you
here
do
we
bobbie
yes
said
bobbie
and
she
saw
by
her
mother
face
how
right
she
had
been
to
bring
home
the
wounded
hound
in
the
red
jersey
chapter
xiii
the
hound
grandfather
mother
did
not
get
back
to
her
writing
all
that
day
for
the
hound
whom
the
children
had
brought
to
three
chimneys
had
to
be
put
to
bed
and
then
the
doctor
came
and
hurt
him
most
horribly
mother
was
with
him
all
through
it
and
that
made
it
a
little
better
than
it
would
have
been
but
bad
was
the
best
as
viney
said
the
children
sat
in
the
parlour
downstairs
and
heard
the
sound
of
the
doctor
boots
going
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
bedroom
floor
and
once
or
twice
there
was
a
groan
it
horrible
said
bobbie
oh
i
wish
forrest
would
make
haste
oh
poor
jim
it
is
horrible
said
peter
but
it
very
exciting
i
wish
doctors
were
so
about
who
they
have
in
the
room
when
doing
things
i
should
most
awfully
like
to
see
a
leg
set
i
believe
the
bones
crunch
like
do
said
the
two
girls
at
once
rubbish
said
peter
how
are
you
going
to
be
red
cross
nurses
like
you
were
talking
of
coming
home
if
you
ca
even
stand
hearing
me
say
about
bones
crunching
you
have
to
hear
them
crunch
on
the
field
of
battle
and
be
steeped
in
gore
up
to
the
elbows
as
likely
as
not
and
stop
it
cried
bobbie
with
a
white
face
you
do
know
how
funny
you
making
me
me
too
said
phyllis
whose
face
was
pink
cowards
said
peter
i
not
said
bobbie
i
helped
mother
with
your
foot
and
so
did
phil
you
know
we
well
then
said
peter
now
look
here
it
would
be
a
jolly
good
thing
for
you
if
i
were
to
talk
to
you
every
day
for
half
an
hour
about
broken
bones
and
people
insides
so
as
to
get
you
used
to
a
chair
was
moved
above
listen
said
peter
that
the
bone
i
do
wish
you
would
said
phyllis
bobbie
does
like
i
tell
you
what
they
do
said
peter
i
ca
think
what
made
him
so
horrid
perhaps
it
was
because
he
had
been
so
very
nice
and
kind
all
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
and
now
he
had
to
have
a
change
this
is
called
reaction
one
notices
it
now
and
then
in
oneself
sometimes
when
one
has
been
extra
good
for
a
longer
time
than
usual
one
is
suddenly
attacked
by
a
violent
fit
of
not
being
good
at
all
i
tell
you
what
they
do
said
peter
they
strap
the
broken
man
down
so
that
he
ca
resist
or
interfere
with
their
doctorish
designs
and
then
someone
holds
his
head
and
someone
holds
his
leg
the
broken
one
and
pulls
it
till
the
bones
fit
in
with
a
crunch
mind
you
then
they
strap
it
up
and
let
play
at
oh
no
said
phyllis
but
bobbie
said
suddenly
all
right
let
i
be
the
doctor
and
phil
can
be
the
nurse
you
can
be
the
broken
boner
we
can
get
at
your
legs
more
easily
because
you
do
wear
i
get
the
splints
and
bandages
said
peter
you
get
the
couch
of
suffering
the
ropes
that
had
tied
up
the
boxes
that
had
come
from
home
were
all
in
a
wooden
in
the
cellar
when
peter
brought
in
a
trailing
tangle
of
them
and
two
boards
for
splints
phyllis
was
excitedly
giggling
now
then
he
said
and
lay
down
on
the
settle
groaning
most
grievously
not
so
loud
said
bobbie
beginning
to
wind
the
rope
round
him
and
the
settle
you
pull
not
so
tight
moaned
peter
you
break
my
other
bobbie
worked
on
in
silence
winding
more
and
more
rope
round
him
that
enough
said
peter
i
ca
move
at
all
oh
my
poor
leg
he
groaned
again
sure
you
ca
move
asked
bobbie
in
a
rather
strange
tone
quite
sure
replied
peter
shall
we
play
it
bleeding
freely
or
not
he
asked
cheerfully
you
can
play
what
you
like
said
bobbie
sternly
folding
her
arms
and
looking
down
at
him
where
he
lay
all
wound
round
and
round
with
cord
phil
and
i
are
going
away
and
we
sha
untie
you
till
you
promise
never
never
to
talk
to
us
about
blood
and
wounds
unless
we
say
you
may
come
phil
you
beast
said
peter
writhing
i
never
promise
never
yell
and
mother
will
do
said
bobbie
and
tell
her
why
we
tied
you
up

on
phil
no
i
not
a
beast
peter
but
you
would
stop
when
we
asked
you
and
yah
said
peter
it
was
even
your
own
idea
you
got
it
out
of
stalky
bobbie
and
phil
retiring
in
silent
dignity
were
met
at
the
door
by
the
doctor
he
came
in
rubbing
his
hands
and
looking
pleased
with
himself
well
he
said
that
job
done
it
a
nice
clean
fracture
and
go
on
all
right
i
no
doubt
plucky
young
chap
too
hullo
all
this
his
eye
had
fallen
on
peter
who
lay
in
his
bonds
on
the
settle
playing
at
prisoners
eh
he
said
but
his
eyebrows
had
gone
up
a
little
somehow
he
had
not
thought
that
bobbie
would
be
playing
while
in
the
room
above
someone
was
having
a
broken
bone
set
oh
no
said
bobbie
not
at
prisoners
we
were
playing
at
setting
bones
peter
the
broken
boner
and
i
was
the
the
doctor
frowned
then
i
must
say
he
said
and
he
said
it
rather
sternly
that
a
very
heartless
game
have
you
enough
imagination
even
to
faintly
picture
what
been
going
on
upstairs
that
poor
chap
with
the
drops
of
sweat
on
his
forehead
and
biting
his
lips
so
as
not
to
cry
out
and
every
touch
on
his
leg
agony
and
you
ought
to
be
tied
up
said
phyllis
you
as
bad
as
hush
said
bobbie
i
sorry
but
we
were
heartless
i
was
i
suppose
said
peter
crossly
all
right
bobbie
do
you
go
on
being
noble
and
screening
me
because
i
jolly
well
wo
have
it
it
was
only
that
i
kept
on
talking
about
blood
and
wounds
i
wanted
to
train
them
for
red
cross
nurses
and
i
would
stop
when
they
asked
well
said
forrest
sitting
down
well
then
i
said
play
at
setting
bones
it
was
all
rot
i
knew
bobbie
would
i
only
said
it
to
tease
her
and
then
when
she
said
of
course
i
had
to
go
through
with
it
and
they
tied
me
up
they
got
it
out
of
stalky
and
i
think
it
a
beastly
he
managed
to
writhe
over
and
hide
his
face
against
the
wooden
back
of
the
settle
i
did
think
that
anyone
would
know
but
us
said
bobbie
indignantly
answering
peter
unspoken
reproach
i
never
thought
of
your
coming
in
and
hearing
about
blood
and
wounds
does
really
make
me
feel
most
awfully
funny
it
was
only
a
joke
our
tying
him
up
let
me
untie
you
i
do
care
if
you
never
untie
me
said
peter
and
if
that
your
idea
of
a
joke
if
i
were
you
said
the
doctor
though
really
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
i
should
be
untied
before
your
mother
comes
down
you
do
want
to
worry
her
just
now
do
you
i
do
promise
anything
about
not
saying
about
wounds
mind
said
peter
in
very
surly
tones
as
bobbie
and
phyllis
began
to
untie
the
knots
i
very
sorry
pete
bobbie
whispered
leaning
close
to
him
as
she
fumbled
with
the
big
knot
under
the
settle
but
if
you
only
knew
how
sick
you
made
me
you
made
me
feel
pretty
sick
i
can
tell
you
peter
rejoined
then
he
shook
off
the
loose
cords
and
stood
up
i
looked
in
said
forrest
to
see
if
one
of
you
would
come
along
to
the
surgery
there
are
some
things
that
your
mother
will
want
at
once
and
i
given
my
man
a
day
off
to
go
and
see
the
circus
will
you
come
peter
peter
went
without
a
word
or
a
look
to
his
sisters
the
two
walked
in
silence
up
to
the
gate
that
led
from
the
three
chimneys
field
to
the
road
then
peter
said
let
me
carry
your
bag
i
say
it
is
heavy
what
in
it
oh
knives
and
lancets
and
different
instruments
for
hurting
people
and
the
ether
bottle
i
had
to
give
him
ether
you
know
the
agony
was
so
peter
was
silent
tell
me
all
about
how
you
found
that
chap
said
forrest
peter
told
and
then
forrest
told
him
stories
of
brave
rescues
he
was
a
most
interesting
man
to
talk
to
as
peter
had
often
remarked
then
in
the
surgery
peter
had
a
better
chance
than
he
had
ever
had
of
examining
the
doctor
balance
and
his
microscope
and
his
scales
and
measuring
glasses
when
all
the
things
were
ready
that
peter
was
to
take
back
the
doctor
said
suddenly
you
excuse
my
shoving
my
oar
in
wo
you
but
i
should
like
to
say
something
to
now
for
a
rowing
thought
peter
who
had
been
wondering
how
it
was
that
he
had
escaped
one
something
scientific
added
the
doctor
yes
said
peter
fiddling
with
the
fossil
ammonite
that
the
doctor
used
for
a
well
then
you
see
boys
and
girls
are
only
little
men
and
women
and
we
are
much
harder
and
hardier
than
they
are
peter
liked
the
perhaps
the
doctor
had
known
he
would
and
much
stronger
and
things
that
hurt
them
do
hurt
us
you
know
you
must
hit
a
girl
i
should
think
not
indeed
muttered
peter
indignantly
not
even
if
she
your
own
sister
that
because
girls
are
so
much
softer
and
weaker
than
we
are
they
have
to
be
you
know
he
added
because
if
they
were
it
would
be
nice
for
the
babies
and
why
all
the
animals
are
so
good
to
the
mother
animals
they
never
fight
them
you
i
know
said
peter
interested
two
buck
rabbits
will
fight
all
day
if
you
let
them
but
they
wo
hurt
a
no
and
quite
wild
beasts
lions
and
elephants
they
immensely
gentle
with
the
female
beasts
and
we
got
to
be
i
see
said
peter
and
their
hearts
are
soft
too
the
doctor
went
on
and
things
that
we
should
think
anything
of
hurt
them
dreadfully
so
that
a
man
has
to
be
very
careful
not
only
of
his
fists
but
of
his
words
awfully
brave
you
know
he
went
on
think
of
bobbie
waiting
alone
in
the
tunnel
with
that
poor
chap
it
an
odd
thing
the
softer
and
more
easily
hurt
a
woman
is
the
better
she
can
screw
herself
up
to
do
what
has
to
be
done
i
seen
some
brave
women
your
mother
one
he
ended
abruptly
yes
said
peter
well
that
all
excuse
my
mentioning
it
but
nobody
knows
everything
without
being
told
and
you
see
what
i
mean
do
you
yes
said
peter
i
sorry
there
of
course
you
are
people
always
are
directly
they
understand
everyone
ought
to
be
taught
these
scientific
facts
so
long
they
shook
hands
heartily
when
peter
came
home
his
sisters
looked
at
him
doubtfully
it
pax
said
peter
dumping
down
the
basket
on
the
table
dr
forrest
has
been
talking
scientific
to
me
no
it
no
use
my
telling
you
what
he
said
you
would
understand
but
it
all
comes
to
you
girls
being
poor
soft
weak
frightened
things
like
rabbits
so
us
men
have
just
got
to
put
up
with
them
he
said
you
were
female
beasts
shall
i
take
this
up
to
mother
or
will
you
i
know
what
boys
are
said
phyllis
with
flaming
cheeks
they
just
the
nastiest
rudest
they
very
brave
said
bobbie
ah
you
mean
the
chap
upstairs
i
see
go
ahead
phil
i
shall
put
up
with
you
whatever
you
say
because
you
a
poor
weak
frightened
soft
not
if
i
pull
your
hair
you
wo
said
phyllis
springing
at
him
he
said
said
bobbie
pulling
her
away
do
you
see
she
whispered
as
peter
picked
up
the
basket
and
stalked
out
with
it
sorry
really
only
he
wo
say
so
let
say
we
it
so
goody
goody
said
phyllis
doubtfully
he
said
we
were
female
beasts
and
soft
and
frightened
then
let
show
him
we
not
frightened
of
him
thinking
us
goody
goody
said
bobbie
and
we
not
any
more
beasts
than
he
and
when
peter
came
back
still
with
his
chin
in
the
air
bobbie
said
we
sorry
we
tied
you
up
i
thought
you
would
be
said
peter
very
stiff
and
superior
this
was
hard
to
bear
but
well
so
we
are
said
bobbie
now
let
honour
be
satisfied
on
both
i
did
call
it
pax
said
peter
in
an
injured
tone
then
let
it
be
pax
said
bobbie
come
on
phil
let
get
the
tea
pete
you
might
lay
the
i
say
said
phyllis
when
peace
was
really
restored
which
was
not
till
they
were
washing
up
the
cups
after
tea
dr
forrest
did
really
say
we
were
female
beasts
did
he
yes
said
peter
firmly
but
i
think
he
meant
we
men
were
wild
beasts
how
funny
of
him
said
phyllis
breaking
a
cup
may
i
come
in
mother
peter
was
at
the
door
of
mother
writing
room
where
mother
sat
at
her
table
with
two
candles
in
front
of
her
their
flames
looked
orange
and
violet
against
the
clear
grey
blue
of
the
sky
where
already
a
few
stars
were
twinkling
yes
dear
said
mother
absently
anything
wrong
she
wrote
a
few
more
words
and
then
laid
down
her
pen
and
began
to
fold
up
what
she
had
written
i
was
just
writing
to
jim
grandfather
he
lives
near
here
you
yes
you
said
so
at
tea
that
what
i
want
to
say
must
you
write
to
him
mother
could
we
keep
jim
and
not
say
anything
to
his
people
till
he
well
it
would
be
such
a
surprise
for
well
yes
said
mother
laughing
i
think
it
you
see
peter
went
on
of
course
the
girls
are
all
right
and
all
that
i
not
saying
anything
against
them
but
i
should
like
it
if
i
had
another
chap
to
talk
to
yes
said
mother
i
know
it
dull
for
you
dear
but
i
help
it
next
year
perhaps
i
can
send
you
to
school
you
like
that
would
you
i
do
miss
the
other
chaps
rather
peter
confessed
but
if
jim
could
stay
after
his
leg
was
well
we
could
have
awful
i
no
doubt
of
it
said
mother
well
perhaps
he
could
but
you
know
dear
we
not
rich
i
ca
afford
to
get
him
everything
want
and
he
must
have
a
ca
you
nurse
him
mother
you
do
nurse
people
so
that
a
pretty
compliment
pete
but
i
ca
do
nursing
and
my
writing
as
well
that
the
worst
of
then
you
must
send
the
letter
to
his
grandfather
of
course
and
to
his
schoolmaster
too
we
telegraphed
to
them
both
but
i
must
write
as
well
they
be
most
dreadfully
i
say
mother
why
ca
his
grandfather
pay
for
a
nurse
peter
suggested
that
would
be
ripping
i
expect
the
old
boy
rolling
in
money
grandfathers
in
books
always
well
this
one
is
in
a
book
said
mother
so
we
must
expect
him
to
roll
i
say
said
peter
musingly
would
it
be
jolly
if
we
all
were
in
a
book
and
you
were
writing
it
then
you
could
make
all
sorts
of
jolly
things
happen
and
make
jim
legs
get
well
at
once
and
be
all
right
and
father
come
home
soon
and
do
you
miss
your
father
very
much
mother
asked
rather
coldly
peter
thought
awfully
said
peter
briefly
mother
was
enveloping
and
addressing
the
second
letter
you
see
peter
went
on
slowly
you
see
it
not
only
him
being
father
but
now
he
away
there
no
other
man
in
the
house
but
me
that
why
i
want
jim
to
stay
so
frightfully
much
would
you
like
to
be
writing
that
book
with
us
all
in
it
mother
and
make
daddy
come
home
soon
peter
mother
put
her
arm
round
him
suddenly
and
hugged
him
in
silence
for
a
minute
then
she
said
do
you
think
it
rather
nice
to
think
that
we
in
a
book
that
god
writing
if
i
were
writing
the
book
i
might
make
mistakes
but
god
knows
how
to
make
the
story
end
just
right
in
the
way
that
best
for
do
you
really
believe
that
mother
peter
asked
quietly
yes
she
said
i
do
believe
it
almost
always
except
when
i
so
sad
that
i
ca
believe
anything
but
even
when
i
ca
believe
it
i
know
it
true
and
i
try
to
believe
you
do
know
how
i
try
peter
now
take
the
letters
to
the
post
and
do
let
be
sad
any
more
courage
courage
that
the
finest
of
all
the
virtues
i
dare
say
jim
will
be
here
for
two
or
three
weeks
for
what
was
left
of
the
evening
peter
was
so
angelic
that
bobbie
feared
he
was
going
to
be
she
was
quite
relieved
in
the
morning
to
find
him
plaiting
phyllis
hair
on
to
the
back
of
her
chair
in
quite
his
old
manner
it
was
soon
after
breakfast
that
a
knock
came
at
the
door
the
children
were
hard
at
work
cleaning
the
brass
candlesticks
in
honour
of
visit
that
be
the
doctor
said
mother
i
go
shut
the
kitchen
door
you
not
fit
to
be
but
it
was
the
doctor
they
knew
that
by
the
voice
and
by
the
sound
of
the
boots
that
went
upstairs
they
did
not
recognise
the
sound
of
the
boots
but
everyone
was
certain
that
they
had
heard
the
voice
before
there
was
a
longish
interval
the
boots
and
the
voice
did
not
come
down
again
who
can
it
possibly
be
they
kept
on
asking
themselves
and
each
other
perhaps
said
peter
at
last
dr
forrest
has
been
attacked
by
highwaymen
and
left
for
dead
and
this
is
the
man
he
telegraphed
for
to
take
his
place
viney
said
he
had
a
local
tenant
to
do
his
work
when
he
went
for
a
holiday
did
you
viney
i
did
so
my
dear
said
viney
from
the
back
kitchen
he
fallen
down
in
a
fit
more
likely
said
phyllis
all
human
aid
despaired
of
and
this
is
his
man
come
to
break
the
news
to
nonsense
said
peter
briskly
mother
would
have
taken
the
man
up
into
jim
bedroom
why
should
she
listen
the
door
opening
now
they
come
down
i
open
the
door
a
he
did
it
not
listening
he
replied
indignantly
to
bobbie
scandalised
remarks
nobody
in
their
senses
would
talk
secrets
on
the
stairs
and
mother
ca
have
secrets
to
talk
with
forrest
and
you
said
it
was
bobbie
called
mother
voice
they
opened
the
kitchen
door
and
mother
leaned
over
the
stair
railing
jim
grandfather
has
come
she
said
wash
your
hands
and
faces
and
then
you
can
see
him
he
wants
to
see
you
the
bedroom
door
shut
again
there
now
said
peter
fancy
us
not
even
thinking
of
that
let
have
some
hot
water
viney
i
as
black
as
your
the
three
were
indeed
dirty
for
the
stuff
you
clean
brass
candlesticks
with
is
very
far
from
cleaning
to
the
cleaner
they
were
still
busy
with
soap
and
flannel
when
they
heard
the
boots
and
the
voice
come
down
the
stairs
and
go
into
the
and
when
they
were
clean
though
still
damp
because
it
takes
such
a
long
time
to
dry
your
hands
properly
and
they
were
very
impatient
to
see
the
grandfather
they
filed
into
the
mother
was
sitting
in
the
and
in
the
armchair
that
father
always
used
to
sit
in
at
the
other
house
sat
their
own
old
gentleman
well
i
never
did
said
peter
even
before
he
said
how
do
you
do
he
was
as
he
explained
afterwards
too
surprised
even
to
remember
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
politeness
much
less
to
practise
it
it
our
own
old
gentleman
said
phyllis
oh
it
you
said
bobbie
and
then
they
remembered
themselves
and
their
manners
and
said
how
do
you
do
very
nicely
this
is
jim
grandfather
said
mother
naming
the
old
gentleman
name
how
splendid
said
peter
that
just
exactly
like
a
book
is
it
mother
it
is
rather
said
mother
smiling
things
do
happen
in
real
life
that
are
rather
like
books
i
am
so
awfully
glad
it
is
you
said
phyllis
when
you
think
of
the
tons
of
old
gentlemen
there
are
in
the
world
it
might
have
been
almost
i
say
though
said
peter
you
not
going
to
take
jim
away
though
are
you
not
at
present
said
the
old
gentleman
your
mother
has
most
kindly
consented
to
let
him
stay
here
i
thought
of
sending
a
nurse
but
your
mother
is
good
enough
to
say
that
she
will
nurse
him
but
what
about
her
writing
said
peter
before
anyone
could
stop
him
there
wo
be
anything
for
him
to
eat
if
mother
does
that
all
right
said
mother
hastily
the
old
gentleman
looked
very
kindly
at
mother
i
see
he
said
you
trust
your
children
and
confide
in
of
course
said
mother
then
i
may
tell
them
of
our
little
arrangement
he
said
your
mother
my
dears
has
consented
to
give
up
writing
for
a
little
while
and
to
become
a
matron
of
my
oh
said
phyllis
blankly
and
shall
we
have
to
go
away
from
three
chimneys
and
the
railway
and
everything
no
no
darling
said
mother
hurriedly
the
hospital
is
called
three
chimneys
hospital
said
the
old
gentleman
and
my
unlucky
jim
the
only
patient
and
i
hope

to
be
so
your
mother
will
be
matron
and
there
be
a
hospital
staff
of
a
housemaid
and
a
cook
till
jim
and
then
will
mother
go
on
writing
again
asked
peter
we
shall
see
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
slight
swift
glance
at
bobbie
perhaps
something
nice
may
happen
and
she
wo
have
i
love
my
writing
said
mother
very
quickly
i
know
said
the
old
gentleman
do
be
afraid
that
i
going
to
try
to
interfere
but
one
never
knows
very
wonderful
and
beautiful
things
do
happen
do
they
and
we
live
most
of
our
lives
in
the
hope
of
them
i
may
come
again
to
see
the
boy
surely
said
mother
and
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
for
making
it
possible
for
me
to
nurse
him
dear
boy
he
kept
calling
mother
mother
in
the
night
said
phyllis
i
woke
up
twice
and
heard
he
did
mean
me
said
mother
in
a
low
voice
to
the
old
gentleman
that
why
i
wanted
so
much
to
keep
the
old
gentleman
rose
i
so
glad
said
peter
that
you
going
to
keep
him
take
care
of
your
mother
my
dears
said
the
old
gentleman
she
a
woman
in
a
yes
is
she
whispered
bobbie
god
bless
her
said
the
old
gentleman
taking
both
mother
hands
god
bless
her
ay
and
she
shall
be
blessed
dear
me
where
my
hat
will
bobbie
come
with
me
to
the
gate
at
the
gate
he
stopped
and
said
you
a
good
child
my
dear
i
got
your
letter
but
it
was
needed
when
i
read
about
your
father
case
in
the
papers
at
the
time
i
had
my
doubts
and
ever
since
i
known
who
you
were
i
been
trying
to
find
out
things
i
have
done
very
much
yet
but
i
have
hopes
my
dear
i
have
oh
said
bobbie
choking
a
little
yes
i
may
say
great
hopes
but
keep
your
secret
a
little
longer
would
do
to
upset
your
mother
with
a
false
hope
would
it
oh
but
it
is
false
said
bobbie
i
know
you
can
do
it
i
knew
you
could
when
i
wrote
it
is
a
false
hope
is
it
no
he
said
i
do
think
it
a
false
hope
or
i
would
have
told
you
and
i
think
you
deserve
to
be
told
that
there
is
a
and
you
do
think
father
did
it
do
you
oh
say
you
do
think
he
my
dear
he
said
i
perfectly
certain
he
if
it
was
a
false
hope
it
was
none
the
less
a
very
radiant
one
that
lay
warm
at
bobbie
heart
and
through
the
days
that
followed
lighted
her
little
face
as
a
japanese
lantern
is
lighted
by
the
candle
within
chapter
xiv
the
end
life
at
the
three
chimneys
was
never
quite
the
same
again
after
the
old
gentleman
came
to
see
his
grandson
although
they
now
knew
his
name
the
children
never
spoke
of
him
by
it
at
any
rate
when
they
were
by
themselves
to
them
he
was
always
the
old
gentleman
and
i
think
he
had
better
be
the
old
gentleman
to
us
too
it
would
make
him
seem
any
more
real
to
you
would
it
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
his
name
was
snooks
or
jenkins
which
it
was
and
after
all
i
must
be
allowed
to
keep
one
secret
it
the
only
one
i
have
told
you
everything
else
except
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
in
this
chapter
which
is
the
last
at
least
of
course
i
have
told
you
everything
if
i
were
to
do
that
the
book
would
never
come
to
an
end
and
that
would
be
a
pity
would
it
well
as
i
was
saying
life
at
three
chimneys
was
never
quite
the
same
again
the
cook
and
the
housemaid
were
very
nice
i
do
mind
telling
you
their
names
they
were
clara
and
ethelwyn
but
they
told
mother
they
did
not
seem
to
want
viney
and
that
she
was
an
old
muddler
so
viney
came
only
two
days
a
week
to
do
washing
and
ironing
then
clara
and
ethelwyn
said
they
could
do
the
work
all
right
if
they
interfered
with
and
that
meant
that
the
children
no
longer
got
the
tea
and
cleared
it
away
and
washed
up
the
and
dusted
the
rooms
this
would
have
left
quite
a
blank
in
their
lives
although
they
had
often
pretended
to
themselves
and
to
each
other
that
they
hated
housework
but
now
that
mother
had
no
writing
and
no
housework
to
do
she
had
time
for
lessons
and
lessons
the
children
had
to
do
however
nice
the
person
who
is
teaching
you
may
be
lessons
are
lessons
all
the
world
over
and
at
their
best
are
worse
fun
than
peeling
potatoes
or
lighting
a
fire
on
the
other
hand
if
mother
now
had
time
for
lessons
she
also
had
time
for
play
and
to
make
up
little
rhymes
for
the
children
as
she
used
to
do
she
had
not
had
much
time
for
rhymes
since
she
came
to
three
chimneys
there
was
one
very
odd
thing
about
these
lessons
whatever
the
children
were
doing
they
always
wanted
to
be
doing
something
else
when
peter
was
doing
his
latin
he
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
be
learning
history
like
bobbie
bobbie
would
have
preferred
arithmetic
which
was
what
phyllis
happened
to
be
doing
and
phyllis
of
course
thought
latin
much
the
most
interesting
kind
of
lesson
and
so
on
so
one
day
when
they
sat
down
to
lessons
each
of
them
found
a
little
rhyme
at
its
place
i
put
the
rhymes
in
to
show
you
that
their
mother
really
did
understand
a
little
how
children
feel
about
things
and
also
the
kind
of
words
they
use
which
is
the
case
with
very
few
people
i
suppose
most
have
very
bad
memories
and
have
forgotten
how
they
felt
when
they
were
little
of
course
the
verses
are
supposed
to
be
spoken
by
the
children
peter
i
once
thought
caesar
easy
pap
how
very
soft
i
must
have
been
when
they
start
caesar
with
a
chap
he
little
know
what
that
will
mean
oh
verbs
are
silly
stupid
things
i
rather
learn
the
dates
of
kings
bobbie
the
worst
of
all
my
lesson
things
is
learning
who
succeeded
who
in
all
the
rows
of
queens
and
kings
with
dates
to
everything
they
do
with
dates
enough
to
make
you
sick
i
wish
it
was
arithmetic
phyllis
such
pounds
and
pounds
of
apples
fill
my
slate
what
is
the
price
you
spend
you
scratch
the
figures
out
until
you
cry
upon
the
dividend
i
break
the
slate
and
scream
for
joy
if
i
did
latin
like
a
boy
this
kind
of
thing
of
course
made
lessons
much
jollier
it
is
something
to
know
that
the
person
who
is
teaching
you
sees
that
it
is
not
all
plain
sailing
for
you
and
does
not
think
that
it
is
just
your
stupidness
that
makes
you
not
know
your
lessons
till
you
learned
them
then
as
jim
leg
got
better
it
was
very
pleasant
to
go
up
and
sit
with
him
and
hear
tales
about
his
school
life
and
the
other
boys
there
was
one
boy
named
parr
of
whom
jim
seemed
to
have
formed
the
lowest
possible
opinion
and
another
boy
named
wigsby
minor
for
whose
views
jim
had
a
great
respect
also
there
were
three
brothers
named
paley
and
the
youngest
was
called
paley
terts
and
was
much
given
to
fighting
peter
drank
in
all
this
with
deep
joy
and
mother
seemed
to
have
listened
with
some
interest
for
one
day
she
gave
jim
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
she
had
written
a
rhyme
about
parr
bringing
in
paley
and
wigsby
by
name
in
a
most
wonderful
way
as
well
as
all
the
reasons
jim
had
for
not
liking
parr
and
wigsby
wise
opinion
on
the
matter
jim
was
immensely
pleased
he
had
never
had
a
rhyme
written
expressly
for
him
before
he
read
it
till
he
knew
it
by
heart
and
then
he
sent
it
to
wigsby
who
liked
it
almost
as
much
as
jim
did
perhaps
you
may
like
it
too
the
new
boy
his
name
is
parr
he
says
that
he
is
given
bread
and
milk
for
tea
he
says
his
father
killed
a
bear
he
says
his
mother
cuts
his
hair
he
wears
goloshes
when
it
wet
i
heard
his
people
call
him
pet
he
has
no
proper
sense
of
shame
he
told
the
chaps
his
christian
name
he
can
not
at
all
he
frightened
of
a
cricket
ball
he
reads
indoors
for
hours
and
hours
he
knows
the
names
of
beastly
flowers
he
says
his
french
just
like
mossoo
a
beastly
thing
to
do
he
wo
keep
shirks
his
turn
and
says
he
came
to
school
to
learn
he
wo
play
football
says
it
hurts
he
would
fight
with
paley
terts
he
could
whistle
if
he
tried
and
when
we
laughed
at
him
he
cried
now
wigsby
minor
says
that
parr
is
only
like
all
new
boys
are
i
know
when
first
came
to
school
i
was
such
a
jolly
fool
jim
could
never
understand
how
mother
could
have
been
clever
enough
to
do
it
to
the
others
it
seemed
nice
but
natural
you
see
they
had
always
been
used
to
having
a
mother
who
could
write
verses
just
like
the
way
people
talk
even
to
the
shocking
expression
at
the
end
of
the
rhyme
which
was
jim
very
own
jim
taught
peter
to
play
chess
and
draughts
and
dominoes
and
altogether
it
was
a
nice
quiet
time
only
jim
leg
got
better
and
better
and
a
general
feeling
began
to
spring
up
among
bobbie
peter
and
phyllis
that
something
ought
to
be
done
to
amuse
him
not
just
games
but
something
really
handsome
but
it
was
extraordinarily
difficult
to
think
of
anything
it
no
good
said
peter
when
all
of
them
had
thought
and
thought
till
their
heads
felt
quite
heavy
and
swollen
if
we
ca
think
of
anything
to
amuse
him
we
just
ca
and
there
an
end
of
it
perhaps
something
will
just
happen
of
its
own
accord
that
he
things
do
happen
by
themselves
sometimes
without
your
making
them
said
phyllis
rather
as
though
usually
everything
that
happened
in
the
world
was
her
doing
i
wish
something
would
happen
said
bobbie
dreamily
something
and
something
wonderful
did
happen
exactly
four
days
after
she
had
said
this
i
wish
i
could
say
it
was
three
days
after
because
in
fairy
tales
it
is
always
three
days
after
that
things
happen
but
this
is
not
a
fairy
story
and
besides
it
really
was
four
and
not
three
and
i
am
nothing
if
not
strictly
truthful
they
seemed
to
be
hardly
railway
children
at
all
in
those
days
and
as
the
days
went
on
each
had
an
uneasy
feeling
about
this
which
phyllis
expressed
one
day
i
wonder
if
the
railway
misses
us
she
said
plaintively
we
never
go
to
see
it
it
seems
ungrateful
said
bobbie
we
loved
it
so
when
we
anyone
else
to
play
perks
is
always
coming
up
to
ask
after
jim
said
peter
and
the
signalman
little
boy
is
better
he
told
me
i
did
mean
the
people
explained
phyllis
i
meant
the
dear
railway
the
thing
i
do
like
said
bobbie
on
this
fourth
day
which
was
a
tuesday
is
our
having
stopped
waving
to
the
and
sending
our
love
to
father
by
let
begin
again
said
phyllis
and
they
did
somehow
the
change
of
everything
that
was
made
by
having
servants
in
the
house
and
mother
not
doing
any
writing
made
the
time
seem
extremely
long
since
that
strange
morning
at
the
beginning
of
things
when
they
had
got
up
so
early
and
burnt
the
bottom
out
of
the
kettle
and
had
apple
pie
for
breakfast
and
first
seen
the
railway
it
was
september
now
and
the
turf
on
the
slope
to
the
railway
was
dry
and
crisp
little
long
grass
spikes
stood
up
like
bits
of
gold
wire
frail
blue
harebells
trembled
on
their
tough
slender
stalks
gipsy
roses
opened
wide
and
flat
their
discs
and
the
golden
stars
of
john
wort
shone
at
the
edges
of
the
pool
that
lay
halfway
to
the
railway
bobbie
gathered
a
generous
handful
of
the
flowers
and
thought
how
pretty
they
would
look
lying
on
the
blanket
of
that
now
covered
jim
poor
broken
leg
hurry
up
said
peter
or
we
shall
miss
the
i
ca
hurry
more
than
i
am
doing
said
phyllis
oh
bother
it
my
bootlace
has
come
undone
again
when
you
married
said
peter
your
bootlace
will
come
undone
going
up
the
church
aisle
and
your
man
that
you
going
to
get
married
to
will
tumble
over
it
and
smash
his
nose
in
on
the
ornamented
pavement
and
then
you
say
you
wo
marry
him
and
you
have
to
be
an
old
i
sha
said
phyllis
i
much
rather
marry
a
man
with
his
nose
smashed
in
than
not
marry
it
would
be
horrid
to
marry
a
man
with
a
smashed
nose
all
the
same
went
on
bobbie
he
would
be
able
to
smell
the
flowers
at
the
wedding
would
that
be
awful
bother
the
flowers
at
the
wedding
cried
peter
look
the
down
we
must
run
they
ran
and
once
more
they
waved
their
handkerchiefs
without
at
all
minding
whether
the
handkerchiefs
were
clean
or
not
to
the
take
our
love
to
father
cried
bobbie
and
the
others
too
shouted
take
our
love
to
father
the
old
gentleman
waved
from
his
carriage
window
quite
violently
he
waved
and
there
was
nothing
odd
in
that
for
he
always
had
waved
but
what
was
really
remarkable
was
that
from
every
window
handkerchiefs
fluttered
newspapers
signalled
hands
waved
wildly
the
train
swept
by
with
a
rustle
and
roar
the
little
pebbles
jumped
and
danced
under
it
as
it
passed
and
the
children
were
left
looking
at
each
other
well
said
peter
well
said
bobbie
said
phyllis
whatever
on
earth
does
that
mean
asked
peter
but
he
did
not
expect
any
answer
do
know
said
bobbie
perhaps
the
old
gentleman
told
the
people
at
his
station
to
look
out
for
us
and
wave
he
knew
we
should
like
it
now
curiously
enough
this
was
just
what
had
happened
the
old
gentleman
who
was
very
well
known
and
respected
at
his
particular
station
had
got
there
early
that
morning
and
he
had
waited
at
the
door
where
the
young
man
stands
holding
the
interesting
machine
that
clips
the
tickets
and
he
had
said
something
to
every
single
passenger
who
passed
through
that
door
and
after
nodding
to
what
the
old
gentleman
had
said
and
the
nods
expressed
every
shade
of
surprise
interest
doubt
cheerful
pleasure
and
grumpy
agreement
each
passenger
had
gone
on
to
the
platform
and
read
one
certain
part
of
his
newspaper
and
when
the
passengers
got
into
the
train
they
had
told
the
other
passengers
who
were
already
there
what
the
old
gentleman
had
said
and
then
the
other
passengers
had
also
looked
at
their
newspapers
and
seemed
very
astonished
and
mostly
pleased
then
when
the
train
passed
the
fence
where
the
three
children
were
newspapers
and
hands
and
handkerchiefs
were
waved
madly
till
all
that
side
of
the
train
was
fluttery
with
white
like
the
pictures
of
the
king
coronation
in
the
biograph
at
maskelyne
and
cook
to
the
children
it
almost
seemed
as
though
the
train
itself
was
alive
and
was
at
last
responding
to
the
love
that
they
had
given
it
so
freely
and
so
long
it
is
most
extraordinarily
rum
said
peter
most
stronery
echoed
phyllis
but
bobbie
said
do
you
think
the
old
gentleman
waves
seemed
more
significating
than
usual
no
said
the
others
i
do
said
bobbie
i
thought
he
was
trying
to
explain
something
to
us
with
his
explain
what
asked
peter
not
unnaturally
do
know
bobbie
answered
but
i
do
feel
most
awfully
funny
i
feel
just
exactly
as
if
something
was
going
to
what
is
going
to
happen
said
peter
is
that
phyllis
stocking
is
going
to
come
this
was
but
too
true
the
suspender
had
given
way
in
the
agitation
of
the
waves
to
the
bobbie
handkerchief
served
as
first
aid
to
the
injured
and
they
all
went
home
lessons
were
more
than
usually
difficult
to
bobbie
that
day
indeed
she
disgraced
herself
so
deeply
over
a
quite
simple
sum
about
the
division
of
pounds
of
meat
and
pounds
of
bread
among
hungry
children
that
mother
looked
at
her
anxiously
do
you
feel
quite
well
dear
she
asked
i
do
know
was
bobbie
unexpected
answer
i
do
know
how
i
feel
it
is
that
i
lazy
mother
will
you
let
me
off
lessons
i
feel
as
if
i
wanted
to
be
quite
alone
by
yes
of
course
i
let
you
off
said
mother
but
bobbie
dropped
her
slate
it
cracked
just
across
the
little
green
mark
that
is
so
useful
for
drawing
patterns
round
and
it
was
never
the
same
slate
again
without
waiting
to
pick
it
up
she
bolted
mother
caught
her
in
the
hall
feeling
blindly
among
the
waterproofs
and
umbrellas
for
her
garden
hat
what
is
it
my
sweetheart
said
mother
you
do
feel
ill
do
you
i
do
know
bobbie
answered
a
little
breathlessly
but
i
want
to
be
by
myself
and
see
if
my
head
really
is
all
silly
and
my
inside
all
had
you
better
lie
down
mother
said
stroking
her
hair
back
from
her
forehead
i
be
more
alive
in
the
garden
i
think
said
bobbie
but
she
could
not
stay
in
the
garden
the
hollyhocks
and
the
asters
and
the
late
roses
all
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
something
to
happen
it
was
one
of
those
still
shiny
autumn
days
when
everything
does
seem
to
be
waiting
bobbie
could
not
wait
i
go
down
to
the
station
she
said
and
talk
to
perks
and
ask
about
the
signalman
little
so
she
went
down
on
the
way
she
passed
the
old
lady
from
the
who
gave
her
a
kiss
and
a
hug
but
rather
to
surprise
no
words
except
god
bless
you
love
and
after
a
pause
run
along
the
draper
boy
who
had
sometimes
been
a
little
less
than
civil
and
a
little
more
than
contemptuous
now
touched
his
cap
and
uttered
the
remarkable
words
miss
i
sure
the
blacksmith
coming
along
with
an
open
newspaper
in
his
hand
was
even
more
strange
in
his
manner
he
grinned
broadly
though
as
a
rule
he
was
a
man
not
given
to
smiles
and
waved
the
newspaper
long
before
he
came
up
to
her
and
as
he
passed
her
he
said
in
answer
to
her
good
morning
good
morning
to
you
missie
and
many
of
them
i
wish
you
joy
that
i
do
oh
said
bobbie
to
herself
and
her
heart
quickened
its
beats
something
is
going
to
happen
i
know
it
is
everyone
is
so
odd
like
people
are
in
the
station
master
wrung
her
hand
warmly
in
fact
he
worked
it
up
and
down
like
a
but
he
gave
her
no
reason
for
this
unusually
enthusiastic
greeting
he
only
said
the
a
bit
late
miss
the
extra
luggage
this
holiday
time
and
went
away
very
quickly
into
that
inner
temple
of
his
into
which
even
bobbie
dared
not
follow
him
perks
was
not
to
be
seen
and
bobbie
shared
the
solitude
of
the
platform
with
the
station
cat
this
tortoiseshell
lady
usually
of
a
retiring
disposition
came
to
rub
herself
against
the
brown
stockings
of
bobbie
with
arched
back
waving
tail
and
reverberating
purrs
dear
me
said
bobbie
stooping
to
stroke
her
how
very
kind
everybody
is
even
you
pussy
perks
did
not
appear
until
the
was
signalled
and
then
he
like
everybody
else
that
morning
had
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
hullo
he
said
you
are
well
if
this
is
the
train
it
be
smart
work
well
god
bless
you
my
dear
i
see
it
in
the
paper
and
i
do
think
i
was
ever
so
glad
of
anything
in
all
my
born
days
he
looked
at
bobbie
a
moment
then
said
one
i
must
have
miss
and
no
offence
i
know
on
a
day
like
this
and
with
that
he
kissed
her
first
on
one
cheek
and
then
on
the
other
you
ai
offended
are
you
he
asked
anxiously
i
ai
took
too
great
a
liberty
on
a
day
like
this
you
know
no
no
said
bobbie
of
course
it
not
a
liberty
dear
mr
perks
we
love
you
quite
as
much
as
if
you
were
an
uncle
of
ours
but
on
a
day
like
what
like
this
said
perks
do
i
tell
you
i
see
it
in
the
paper
saw
what
in
the
paper
asked
bobbie
but
already
the
was
steaming
into
the
station
and
the
station
master
was
looking
at
all
the
places
where
perks
was
not
and
ought
to
have
been
bobbie
was
left
standing
alone
the
station
cat
watching
her
from
under
the
bench
with
friendly
golden
eyes
of
course
you
know
already
exactly
what
was
going
to
happen
bobbie
was
not
so
clever
she
had
the
vague
confused
expectant
feeling
that
comes
to
one
heart
in
dreams
what
her
heart
expected
i
ca
tell
perhaps
the
very
thing
that
you
and
i
know
was
going
to
happen
but
her
mind
expected
nothing
it
was
almost
blank
and
felt
nothing
but
tiredness
and
stupidness
and
an
empty
feeling
like
your
body
has
when
you
have
been
a
long
walk
and
it
is
very
far
indeed
past
your
proper
only
three
people
got
out
of
the
the
first
was
a
countryman
with
two
baskety
boxes
full
of
live
chickens
who
stuck
their
russet
heads
out
anxiously
through
the
wicker
bars
the
second
was
miss
peckitt
the
grocer
wife
cousin
with
a
tin
box
and
three
parcels
and
the
third
oh
my
daddy
my
daddy
that
scream
went
like
a
knife
into
the
heart
of
everyone
in
the
train
and
people
put
their
heads
out
of
the
windows
to
see
a
tall
pale
man
with
lips
set
in
a
thin
close
line
and
a
little
girl
clinging
to
him
with
arms
and
legs
while
his
arms
went
tightly
round
her
i
knew
something
wonderful
was
going
to
happen
said
bobbie
as
they
went
up
the
road
but
i
did
think
it
was
going
to
be
this
oh
my
daddy
my
daddy
then
did
mother
get
my
letter
father
asked
there
were
any
letters
this
morning
oh
daddy
it
is
really
you
is
it
the
clasp
of
a
hand
she
had
not
forgotten
assured
her
that
it
was
you
must
go
in
by
yourself
bobbie
and
tell
mother
quite
quietly
that
all
right
they
caught
the
man
who
did
it
everyone
knows
now
that
it
was
your
always
knew
it
was
said
bobbie
me
and
mother
and
our
old
yes
he
said
it
all
his
doing
mother
wrote
and
told
me
you
had
found
out
and
she
told
me
what
you
been
to
her
my
own
little
girl
they
stopped
a
minute
then
and
now
i
see
them
crossing
the
field
bobbie
goes
into
the
house
trying
to
keep
her
eyes
from
speaking
before
her
lips
have
found
the
right
words
to
tell
mother
quite
quietly
that
the
sorrow
and
the
struggle
and
the
parting
are
over
and
done
and
that
father
has
come
home
i
see
father
walking
in
the
garden
waiting
waiting
he
is
looking
at
the
flowers
and
each
flower
is
a
miracle
to
eyes
that
all
these
months
of
spring
and
summer
have
seen
only
flagstones
and
gravel
and
a
little
grudging
grass
but
his
eyes
keep
turning
towards
the
house
and
presently
he
leaves
the
garden
and
goes
to
stand
outside
the
nearest
door
it
is
the
back
door
and
across
the
yard
the
swallows
are
circling
they
are
getting
ready
to
fly
away
from
cold
winds
and
keen
frost
to
the
land
where
it
is
always
summer
they
are
the
same
swallows
that
the
children
built
the
little
clay
nests
for
now
the
house
door
opens
bobbie
voice
calls
come
in
daddy
come
in
he
goes
in
and
the
door
is
shut
i
think
we
will
not
open
the
door
or
follow
him
i
think
that
just
now
we
are
not
wanted
there
i
think
it
will
be
best
for
us
to
go
quickly
and
quietly
away
at
the
end
of
the
field
among
the
thin
gold
spikes
of
grass
and
the
harebells
and
gipsy
roses
and
john
wort
we
may
just
take
one
last
look
over
our
shoulders
at
the
white
house
where
neither
we
nor
anyone
else
is
wanted
now
