our

begins
at

alone

introduction
the
narrative
contained
in
the
papers
which
are
given
to
the
world
in
this
book
is
of
so
marvellous
a
character
as
to
have
made
me
long
hesitate
before
venturing
on
their
publication
even
now
i
do
so
in
the
full
expectation
of
scorn
and
unbelief
i
owe
it
to
the
world
to
state
exactly
how
these
papers
came
into
my
hands
that
done
i
must
leave
it
to
their
own
appearance
of
truth
to
command
belief
the
year
before
last
i
was
travelling
through
northern
africa
on
a
scientific
expedition
it
was
early
in
the
month
of
may
that
i
reached
the
northern
confines
of
the
great
desert
amongst
the
feathery
in
the
delicious
oasis
of
biskra
i
had
started
one
day
with
the
first
streak
of
dawn
upon
a
short
expedition
into
the
desert
my
two
arab
followers
were
anxious
to
cover
as
much
distance
as
possible
before
the
heat
of
the
sun
became
oppressive
it
was
about
ten
before
we
halted
for
breakfast
and
the
oasis
of
biskra
looked
but
a
black
spot
on
the
northern
horizon
the
heavens
up
to
now
were
an
intensely
brilliant
blue
but
a
dark
cloud
far
away
over
the
distant
desert
could
be
seen
rapidly
increasing
in
size
gradually
the
whole
vault
of
sky
assumed
a
coppery
aspect
and
the
sun
shone
paler
and
paler
each
moment
the
heat
and
oppressiveness
were
almost
unbearable
not
a
breath
of
air
relieved
the
suffocating
atmosphere
the
sun
finally
disappeared
behind
the
curtain
of
lowering
cloud
and
a
darkness
began
to
creep
over
the
earth
the
arabs
prepared
for
the
storm
which
they
knew
from
experience
was
brewing
the
dreaded
sandstorm
was
approaching
it
came
on
the
wings
of
the
southern
gale
with
terrific
speed
and
suddenly
the
air
became
almost
as
dark
as
midnight
full
of
fine
blinding
sand
we
could
not
see
twenty
paces
ahead
and
now
the
sluggish
atmosphere
was
stirred
with
the
rushing
and
shrieking
of
a
mighty
wind
as
i
gazed
for
one
brief
moment
upwards
during
a
lull
in
the
storm
my
eyes
were
almost
blinded
by
a
brilliant
light
brighter
than
the
flame
from
an
incandescent
lamp
and
a
thousand
times
as
large
which
seemed
to
shoot
from
out
of
space
at
the
same
awful
moment
the
very
dome
of
heaven
seemed
cracked
asunder
by
a
loud
report
different
from
anything
i
had
ever
heard
before
it
was
a
solid
and
metallic
sound
louder
and
sharper
than
the
report
of
tons
of
exploding
the
earth
shook
and
trembled
to
its
utmost
foundations
and
the
rocks
seemed
to
recoil
at
the
frightful
explosion
the
arabs
were
struck
dumb
and
motionless
with
horror
and
i
for
several
moments
was
as
one
with
the
report
a
huge
body
seemed
to
have
struck
the
rocks
a
short
distance
from
us
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
it
was
until
the
fury
of
the
storm
was
somewhat
spent
the
worst
was
now
over
and
the
sand
the
thunder
and
the
darkness
vanished
almost
as
suddenly
as
they
came
but
we
did
not
venture
forth
until
the
welcome
glorious
sun
shone
down
again
upon
the
wet
rocks
and
then
the
arabs
engaged
in
fervent
prayer
to
allah
for
our
miraculous
deliverance
from
a
terrible
fate
almost
the
first
object
that
my
eyes
rested
upon
as
soon
as
we
left
our
retreat
under
the
rocks
was
a
large
round
mass
of
substance
a
hundred
yards
away
in
amazement
i
walked
towards
the
spot
where
it
lay
hissing
and
steaming
on
the
bare
wet
rocks
surrounded
by
a
thick
coating
of
hailstones
which
the
hot
sun
was
rapidly
melting
it
was
a
meteorolite
of
unusual
dimensions
measuring
exactly
three
feet
nine
inches
in
height
and
was
shaped
like
a
huge
gourd
a
large
crack
extended
completely
down
one
side
about
an
inch
across
in
its
widest
part
i
cautioned
the
arabs
to
preserve
the
strictest
secrecy
and
made
them
swear
by
the
prophet
beard
that
they
would
reveal
to
no
man
what
they
had
seen
and
then
we
returned
to
biskra
it
was
my
intention
to
obtain
a
few
suitable
tools
and
requisites
and
then
return
to
the
meteorolite
at
once
to
investigate
it
would
evidently
take
some
hours
to
cool
besides
if
we
did
not
get
back
search
parties
would
be
scouring
the
desert
in
quest
of
us
and
they
might
by
chance
discover
this
wonderful
stone
i
felt
already
that
this
stone
belonged
to
me
my
interest
in
it
was
early
the
next
morning
with
three
arabs
i
went
off
armed
with
wedges
a
heavy
hammer
some
drills
a
quantity
of
gunpowder
and
fuse
we
found
the
stone
just
as
we
left
it
on
the
previous
day
and
evidently
still
unvisited
by
man
i
first
of
all
tried
to
force
open
the
crack
with
the
wedges
but
the
substance
was
exceedingly
tough
the
appliances
at
my
command
very
crude
and
i
made
no
progress
then
i
set
my
followers
to
work
to
bore
two
holes
into
the
stone
and
fill
them
with
gunpowder
this
plan
worked
admirably
the
drill
cutting
its
way
through
the
soft
spongy
mass
with
great
quickness
and
i
was
soon
ready
to
fire
my
fuse
and
retire
behind
the
rocks
to
wait
events
it
was
an
anxious
moment
for
me
we
had
not
to
wait
long
for
the
reports
which
sounded
like
a
couple
of
rifle
cracks
and
then
we
ran
forward
to
examine
our
prize
alas
it
was
shattered
into
fragments
some
of
them
blown
to
a
distance
of
many
yards
the
charges
were
too
strong
i
was
profoundly
disappointed
and
set
the
arabs
to
work
to
gather
up
the
largest
pieces
and
load
our
camels
with
them
i
was
sitting
dejectedly
enough
upon
the
sand
more
interested
in
the
action
of
a
pair
of
vultures
than
in
the
doings
of
my
men
when
achmed
one
of
my
arabs
made
his
appearance
holding
in
his
arms
a
very
fragment
of
the
meteorolite
it
looked
like
a
rusty
piece
of
iron
ore
oblong
in
shape
and
had
evidently
undergone
great
pressure
examination
told
me
that
this
substance
was
iron
and
its
disproportionate
lightness
together
with
a
blow
from
the
hammer
revealed
the
fact
that
it
was
not
solid
it
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
large
conical
shot
i
set
off
alone
on
my
camel
to
the
oasis
all
impatient
to
get
home
and
examine
my
prize
i
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
until
i
had
finished
my
task
locking
myself
in
my
room
i
began
my
investigation
with
a
singular
presentiment
that
i
was
on
the
eve
of
some
important
discovery
nor
were
my
feelings
unjustified
by
events
with
the
aid
of
a
hammer
and
chisel
after
some
considerable
trouble
and
labour
i
broke
open
this
mass
of
battered
rusty
iron
and
its
strange
contents
rolled
out
on
to
the
table
of
what
were
they
composed
nothing
but
a
long
and
pile
of
papers
so
tightly
packed
that
they
might
have
been
under
hydraulic
pressure
but
their
appearance
filled
me
with
the
intensest
surprise
and
most
utter
amazement
here
and
there
the
edges
were
burnt
and
charred
but
otherwise
they
were
in
a
singularly
good
state
of
preservation
and
the
writing
upon
them
was
almost
as
legible
as
when
it
was
penned
the
paper
had
evidently
been
made
on
earth
for
it
bore
the
watermark
of
a
london
firm
the
most
singular
part
of
all
this
strange
occurrence
however
remains
now
to
be
told
most
of
these
manuscripts
were
written
in
a
good
bold
upright
hand
and
they
were
addressed
and
dated
from
the
city
of
edos
planet
of
mars
or
gathma
december
the
was
i
awake
or
dreaming
many
times
did
i
read
those
three
lines
walking
about
the
room
meantime
to
convince
myself
that
all
was
reality
this
strange
letter
from
an
unknown
world
must
have
been
ten
years
in
the
air
these
manuscripts
were
evidently
of
a
scientific
as
well
as
of
a
popular
character
and
as
a
scientific
man
myself
i
felt
already
that
a
bond
of
sympathy
existed
between
my
unknown
correspondent
far
away
out
yonder
beyond
the
sky
and
myself
a
voice
from
another
world
a
message
from
the
vast
unseen
how
i
longed
to
read
these
papers
to
examine
them
to
revel
in
their
secrets
and
to
enjoy
them
what
a
hidden
world
of
wonder
of
adventure
of
exploration
lay
before
me
if
the
documents
were
genuine
i
sat
up
the
entire
night
eagerly
reading
through
these
strange
papers
africa
had
now
for
the
present
lost
its
charm
i
set
off
back
again
to
europe
with
all
despatch
bent
on
investigating
the
whole
matter
fortunately
my
efforts
were
crowned
with
a
most
gratifying
triumph
doctor
hermann
the
author
of
a
considerable
portion
of
these
manuscripts
i
discovered
had
been
an
eccentric
and
individual
living
a
very
secluded
life
on
a
small
estate
near
the
yorkshire
fells
a
wild
lonely
spot
far
from
cities
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
royal
the
astronomical
and
the
geographical
societies
i
easily
satisfied
myself
he
had
been
absolutely
devoted
to
science
for
this
all
the
other
enjoyments
and
obligations
of
life
were
discarded
he
lived
but
for
one
object
the
study
and
investigation
of
nature
choicest
secrets
this
was
the
faith
of
his
life
from
information
supplied
in
these
manuscripts
i
learned
the
exact
place
of
his
strange
abode
and
was
able
to
visit
it
and
to
make
many
enquiries
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
concerning
him
he
was
described
to
me
as
a
tall
spare
man
with
a
face
past
the
prime
of
life
with
grey
beard
and
moustache
clear
grey
eyes
and
hair
in
nature
gentle
and
tender
as
a
woman
but
brave
as
a
lion
and
with
a
reputation
for
firmness
and
great
strength
of
will
i
was
also
told
that
he
had
a
very
big
telescope
erected
in
his
barn
and
some
of
the
old
folks
living
in
the
fells
always
insisted
that
the
doctor
and
the
devil
were
on
quite
too
intimate
terms
he
had
no
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
one
old
used
to
look
after
the
house
but
she
had
been
dead
some
years
and
had
not
been
on
speaking
terms
with
any
of
the
good
people
living
near
his
sandy
campbell
generally
accompanied
his
master
in
all
his
wanderings
sandy
was
almost
as
much
of
a
character
as
his
master
a
close
reticent
scot
who
could
never
be
got
to
talk
even
when
under
the
influence
of
whisky
a
liquor
he
appeared
to
have
been
particularly
fond
of
the
doctor
had
few
visitors
john
temple
a
bradford
cotton
lord
had
been
often
seen
in
his
company
and
a
young
engineer
from
leeds
called
harry
graham
had
been
also
known
in
the
neighbourhood
as
a
frequent
guest
of
the
doctor
singularly
enough
these
names
were
the
ones
given
in
the
manuscripts
and
therefore
help
to
confirm
their
truth
i
also
learnt
that
some
fourteen
years
ago
doctor
hermann
and
his
man
suddenly
disappeared
from
the
neighbourhood
and
it
was
said
they
had
gone
abroad
on
a
scientific
expedition
the
house
having
been
denuded
of
its
furniture
and
left
standing
empty
from
that
day
to
this
no
one
had
occupied
the
premises
pursuing
my
investigations
further
i
found
that
at
precisely
the
same
time
john
temple
the
bradford
millionaire
left
this
country
presumably
on
a
voyage
round
the
world
and
enquiries
at
the
great
firm
of
manufacturing
engineers
in
leeds
also
revealed
the
fact
that
this
harry
graham
their
cleverest
manager
left
their
employment
to
go
abroad
at
the
same
date
not
one
of
these
persons
has
been
heard
of
since
the
mystery
of
all
these
persons
disappearing
at
the
same
time
and
never
being
heard
of
again
by
mortal
man
is
now
cleared
away
i
hold
the
secret
which
was
flashed
to
me
on
the
wings
of
the
storm
from
boundless
space
upon
the
sands
of
the
sahara
the
following
weird
and
startling
story
will
satisfactorily
explain
the
cause
and
purpose
of
these
individuals
departure
minutely
describe
their
wonderful
and
thrilling
experiences
and
publish
to
the
world
the
reason
why
the
lonely
house
on
the
yorkshire
fells
remains
tenantless
and
is
rapidly
falling
into
ruins
and
the
rich
estates
of
john
temple
cotton
lord
and
millionaire
are
still
amongst
the
unclaimed
treasures
in
the
jealous
keeping
of
the
high
court
of
chancery
the
following
is
in
the
doctor
bold
and
characteristic
handwriting
from
hermann
instructions
to
the
finder
of
the
should
these
manuscripts
chance
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
any
civilised
man
it
is
my
earnest
wish
though
of
german
extraction
myself
that
they
should
be
published
if
published
at
all
in
the
english
tongue
truth
shall
prevail
and
our
return
to
earth
shall
scatter
like
before
the
autumn
winds
the
scepticism
which
i
mistake
not
will
encircle
them
as
soon
as
man
may
read
them
it
is
my
cherished
hope
to
return
to
my
mother
world
and
to
tell
in
person
of
that
glorious
life
and
those
sublime
wonders
of
a
new
world
adieu
this
brief
extract
must
suffice
as
introduction
the
next
chapter
will
begin
at
once
with
the
story
proper
omitting
the
uninteresting
preliminary
portion
of
the
manuscripts
hundred
miles
an
chapter
i
we
prepare
for
our
journey
i
tell
you
temple
that
the
thing
can
be
done
from
experiments
which
i
have
carefully
made
and
from
information
which
i
have
laboriously
collected
during
the
best
part
of
a
lifetime
devoted
to
scientific
research
i
am
in
a
position
confidently
to
state
that
my
project
is
removed
for
ever
from
the
realm
of
possibility
and
is
now
within
measurable
distance
of
becoming
an
accomplished
fact
my
plans
may
seem
complicated
to
you
but
to
me
they
are
simple
in
the
extreme
you
my
dear
fellow
are
better
able
to
deal
with
intricate
financial
questions
discounts
stocks
and
bank
rates
rather
than
the
delicate
experiments
of
science
believe
me
i
have
here
in
this
book
every
item
of
my
scheme
carefully
worked
out
every
design
outlined
to
its
simplest
detail
all
i
want
is
the
necessary
capital
for
its
accomplishment
my
young
friend
harry
graham
here
let
me
introduce
him
to
you
temple
whose
interest
in
astronomy
i
have
long
been
fostering
is
willing
and
ready
to
superintend
the
mechanical
portion
of
my
undertaking
our
models
have
turned
out
satisfactory
in
every
way
all
we
want
now
is
money
that
friend
temple
you
years
ago
may
i
count
upon
your
assistance
still
my
dear
doctor
you
may
if
fifty
thousand
pounds
aye
or
even
a
hundred
thousand
will
help
you
i
am
willing
to
speculate
to
that
amount
and
what
is
more
the
novelty
of
your
undertaking
has
so
captivated
me
that
i
am
anxious
to
form
one
of
your
party
who
knows
if
your
efforts
are
crowned
with
success
what
grand
financial
harvests
may
be
reaped
then
graham
there
is
nothing
now
to
prevent
us
beginning
to
work
in
real
earnest
there
is
much
for
us
to
do
and
i
am
sure
we
shall
deem
it
an
honour
to
have
the
financier
of
our
undertaking
in
our
company
try
another
cigar
friends

let

bring
us
one
more
bottle
of
port
and
then
i
will
endeavour
to
give
you
a
brief
outline
of
my
plans
as
you
know
continued
the
doctor
i
have
long
been
an
ardent
supporter
of
the
theory
of
the
plurality
of
worlds
i
am
a
firm
believer
in
the
principle
of
universal
law
and
the
theory
that
these
other
worlds
are
the
abode
of
living
organisms
is
to
me
an
almost
demonstrable
fact
when
i
first
began
the
study
of
this
interesting
question
i
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
planet
with
which
i
dared
hope
to
obtain
any
success
must
be
one
whose
conditions
were
as
nearly
like
those
of
our
own
world
as
possible
so
far
as
i
know
only
one
orb
in
the
entire
planetary
system
can
with
any
degree
of
fairness
be
compared
with
earth
that
planet
is
mars
in
short
the
beautiful
planet
mars
is
precisely
similar
in
nearly
every
physical
aspect
to
the
earth
it
is
in
fact
only
a
smaller
edition
of
our
own
world
but
i
am
afraid
i
weary
you
temple
with
all
this
scientific
detail
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
more
but
come
to
the
practical
side
of
my
plans
doctor
your
remarks
interest
me
exceedingly
pray
say
all
you
think
desirable
well
then
temple
the
first
difficulty
i
had
to
contend
with
was
that
of
bridging
the
mighty
distance
between
our
earth
and
this
planet
my
second
task
was
the
enormous
journey
itself
and
the
means
of
obtaining
air
and
sustenance
during
the
progress
both
of
these
after
many
experiments
and
many
failures
have
been
overcome
first
as
to
my
means
of
conveyance
i
have
here
a
design
for
an
air
carriage
propelled
by
electricity
capable
of
being
steered
in
any
direction
and
of
attaining
the
stupendous
speed
of
fifteen
hundred
miles
per
hour
it
can
be
made
large
enough
to
afford
all
necessary
accommodation
for
at
least
six
persons
and
its
attendant
apparatus
is
capable
of
administering
to
their
every
requirement
here
is
a
model
of
the
machine
you
will
perceive
that
the
material
of
which
it
is
composed
is
no
metal
in
common
use
nor
is
its
composition
and
the
method
of
its
manufacture
known
to
any
mortal
man
but
myself
it
is
remarkable
for
its
extreme
lightness
toughness
and
power
of
withstanding
heat
melts
at
something
like
degrees
fahrenheit
my
metal
will
stand
a
fiery
ordeal
three
times
as
great
this
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
our
high
rate
of
speed
would
soon
generate
sufficient
heat
to
melt
any
but
the
most
enduring
substance
here
again
is
the
exact
model
of
another
apparatus
for
making
and
storing
electricity
sufficient
for
at
least
two
years
working
at
high
pressure
and
herein
perhaps
is
the
greatest
of
my
discoveries
the
one
grand
problem
which
electricians
have
to
solve
before
this
force
can
be
of
any
great
advantage
to
mankind
is
the
method
of
generating
it
direct
without
the
aid
of
any
other
motive
power
i
have
solved
that
problem
and
have
succeeded
by
the
aid
of
this
curious
apparatus
in
producing
electricity
direct
not
from
coal
but
from
petroleum
by
this
wonderful
invention
i
am
able
to
carry
enough
fuel
for
our
journey
compressed
into
a
space
that
is
practicable
for
all
requirements
and
the
alarming
waste
of
energy
that
now
troubles
the
electrical
engineer
is
saved
the
labour
of
the
world
will
now
be
revolutionised
when
i
choose
to
make
my
discovery
known
for
the
reign
of
steam
glorious
and
wonderful
as
it
has
been
will
then
be
over
i
can
carry
in
my
hand
enough
fuel
to
drive
the
biggest
steamer
that
ploughs
the
ocean
once
round
the
world
but
to
return
this
little
attachment
tells
the
exact
rate
of
speed
the
carriage
is
travelling
you
will
also
perceive
that
my
motors
are
on
the
principle
of
the
and
the
combined
the
interior
of
my
carriage
is
formed
of
a
series
of
chambers
one
above
the
other
there
is
a
laboratory
sleeping
and
living
chambers
engine
and
apparatus
room
and
ample
space
for
stores
in
the
basement
the
door
is
situated
near
the
top
and
just
above
it
i
have
placed
as
you
see
a
small
balcony
for
observations
my
will
be
glazed
with
glass
of
exceptional
quality
made
by
myself
and
every
apartment
is
lighted
with
electricity
the
carriage
is
conical
in
form
that
shape
being
best
adapted
to
a
high
rate
of
speed
my
next
consideration
was
the
supply
of
air
i
think
we
shall
find
that
the
whole
planetary
system
is
pervaded
with
an
atmosphere
so
rare
in
some
parts
of
remotest
space
as
to
remain
undetected
by
any
instrument
yet
known
to
science
but
still
of
sufficient
density
to
offer
resistance
and
lend
support
to
our
carriage
and
its
propellers
my
condensers
are
so
formed
that
they
will
readily
convert
this
ether
into
air
suited
to
man
requirements
i
had
now
but
one
more
task
to
overcome
food
and
water
as
regards
food
i
have
here
a
little
cake
of
animal
and
vegetable
substances
which
have
undergone
a
certain
chemical
process
by
means
of
which
i
have
been
able
to
compress
enough
food
to
support
a
human
being
for
three
days
into
a
space
not
quite
two
cubic
inches
in
extent
in
this
other
tablet
i
have
dealt
with
wheaten
flour
in
a
similar
satisfactory
manner
tea
sugar
and
other
luxuries
i
can
reduce
to
the
smallest
proportions
by
a
process
of
condensation
and
hydraulic
pressure
so
that
i
can
stow
away
in
the
of
my
carriage
enough
food
to
last
six
persons
for
nearly
three
years
a
more
than
ample
supply
as
i
intend
shortly
to
demonstrate
it
has
taken
me
nearly
ten
years
to
solve
the
problem
of
my
water
supply
i
have
here
a
small
electrical
apparatus
by
means
of
which
i
hope
to
be
able
to
distil
water
from
ether
should
my
experiment
fail
i
have
invented
a
small
lozenge
of
soda
and
other
chemicals
which
will
allay
thirst
i
must
also
say
that
i
have
allowed
sufficient
space
for
scientific
instruments
a
stock
of
methylated
spirits
a
selection
of
books
firearms
and
ammunition
nor
have
i
omitted
clothes
cigars
tobacco
a
few
bottles
of
wine
to
be
used
on
state
occasions
and
a
fair
quantity
of
brandy
and
whiskey
so
that
you
temple
shall
not
be
without
your
grog
a
medicine
chest
camera
and
boat
are
also
included
in
my
list
of
necessaries
i
calculate
that
my
will
be
about
forty
feet
in
height
and
nine
feet
in
width
what
i
have
disclosed
is
but
a
portion
of
my
grand
scheme
the
one
great
work
of
my
life
from
which
i
hope
to
obtain
the
most
brilliant
scientific
results
the
planet
mars
will
reach
his
perihelion
or
nearest
distance
to
our
earth
in
october
he
is
then
in
an
unusually
favourable
position
and
affords
us
a
chance
of
visiting
him
which
will
not
occur
again
in
a
lifetime
now
i
calculate
that
our
rate
of
speed
will
be
fifteen
hundred
miles
per
hour
so
that
the
millions
of
miles
we
have
to
traverse
will
be
accomplished
in
about
two
and
years
time
we
must
leave
earth
therefore
not
later
than
the
first
day
of
may
our
stay
of
course
will
depend
on
circumstances
which
no
mortal
man
can
foresee
we
may
indeed
reach
our
destination
in
much
less
time
than
i
have
anticipated
i
ought
here
to
mention
continued
the
doctor
that
my
devoted
servant
sandy
has
already
expressed
his
desire
and
willingness
to
accompany
me
on
this
long
journey
now
temple
and
you
too
graham
i
wish
you
to
weigh
carefully
the
and
of
this
dangerous
enterprize
we
are
about
to
embark
into
the
solemn
boundless
realms
of
space
to
dash
boldly
away
from
the
earth
which
fosters
us
into
mysterious
regions
of
which
we
have
none
but
the
scantiest
knowledge
on
the
other
hand
continued
the
doctor
there
is
grandeur
in
the
thought
of
being
able
to
leave
this
world
of
ours
for
a
season
and
to
visit
those
orbs
which
shine
so
clearly
in
the
midnight
sky
if
you
of
your
own
free
will
are
ready
and
willing
cheerfully
to
cast
in
your
lot
with
mine
i
shall
be
happy
in
your
company
there
was
dead
silence
for
several
moments
after
the
doctor
had
finished
speaking
during
which
the
little
timepiece
on
the
mantel
struck
the
hour
of
midnight
with
almost
painful
clearness
when
graham
was
the
first
to
speak
doctor
you
know
that
through
all
the
experiments
we
have
conducted
together
my
one
aim
has
been
provided
they
were
successful
to
accompany
you
temple
spoke
next
the
ties
my
dear
doctor
that
bind
me
to
earth
and
to
life
are
small
wifeless
childless
relationless
what
have
i
to
look
forward
to
i
freely
place
at
your
disposal
the
sum
i
have
already
named
and
at
the
same
time
pledge
myself
to
make
your
shall
i
say
our
journey
a
success
i
thank
you
friends
for
your
kindness
and
your
proffered
assistance
and
accept
the
offer
of
your
company
with
unqualified
pleasure
it
is
now
november
all
our
preparations
must
be
made
during
the
next
six
months
that
is
by
the
end
of
april
we
must
leave
earth
no
later
than
that
date
i
also
suggest
that
all
our
preparations
are
made
as
secretly
as
possible
let
the
carriage
be
made
in
sections
and
parts
let
all
be
brought
here
bit
by
bit
my
big
barn
will
suit
us
for
a
workshop
idle
curiosity
must
not
be
excited
and
as
a
personal
favour
i
request
that
no
hint
of
this
journey
be
given
to
any
mortal
man
doctor
hermann
then
filled
up
his
glass
all
present
following
his
example
and
together
we
toasted
each
other
and
drank
in
wild
if
silent
enthusiasm
to
the
success
of
our
awful
voyage
through
space
chapter
ii
we
leave
earth
in
the
sirius
at
last
graham
all
is
in
readiness
for
our
departure
i
think
it
was
wise
however
that
before
finally
leaving
earth
we
tested
the
capabilities
of
our
carriage
this
trial
trip
nearly
cost
the
doctor
his
secret
a
party
of
stoutly
swore
that
they
had
seen
a
big
house
floating
over
whernside
as
they
came
home
in
the
dusk
but
they
were
only
laughed
at
by
their
neighbours
and
accused
of
being
in
liquor
we
now
feel
a
greater
amount
of
satisfaction
and
confidence
in
our
undertaking
and
the
several
little
details
we
had
overlooked
will
be
decided
improvements
then
you
are
prepared
to
start
on
saturday
doctor
well
if
temple
can
manage
it
yes
it
rests
with
him
now
and
we
must
not
be
too
hard
or
exacting
on
our
generous
friend
and
patron
ah
sandy
a
telegram
from
temple
i
suppose
says
the
doctor
tearing
open
the
envelope
and
hastily
reading
the
brief
message
yes
graham
all
is
well
temple
wires
me
that
he
will
be
here
on
saturday
to
lunch
that
means
he
is
ready
we
shall
start
at
midnight
the
remaining
days
of
our
stay
on
earth
were
spent
by
graham
in
overhauling
the
various
machinery
and
apparatus
he
had
taken
such
pains
in
making
and
fitting
and
by
the
doctor
in
anxious
consultation
of
several
leading
works
on
astronomy
and
mathematics
and
in
careful
revision
of
every
little
detail
of
his
gigantic
scheme
at
last
the
eventful
morning
came
the
first
day
of
may
glorious
indeed
was
the
weather
on
that
memorable
day
when
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
mankind
five
living
creatures
were
about
to
leave
this
planet
on
a
journey
to
a
orb
now
behold
this
dauntless
little
party
as
they
stand
in
the
garden
watching
their
last
earthly
sunset
the
doctor
is
the
central
figure
of
the
group
as
the
sun
sinks
solemnly
behind
the
pennine
peaks
lingering
a
few
moments
on
the
gloomy
crowns
of
whernside
the
doctor
points
to
the
clear
southern
sky
and
says
well
friends
our
stay
on
earth
is
now
very
short
in
little
over
four
hours
time
we
must
be
gone
yonder
is
our
destination
the
star
that
sheds
such
brilliant
lustre
brightest
to
us
of
all
heavenly
orbs
is
our
bourne
you
see
it
temple
from
this
night
for
two
years
and
it
is
to
be
our
only
guiding
light
ever
increasing
in
size
and
mysterious
splendour
as
the
evening
gloom
crept
up
the
valleys
the
scene
became
more
and
more
solemn
and
impressive
and
a
strange
sense
of
awe
seemed
to
come
over
even
the
bravest
heart
amongst
us
we
felt
too
grave
to
converse
and
the
doctor
remarks
were
received
in
silence
at
last
the
oppressive
silence
was
broken
by
the
doctor
exclaiming
we
had
better
now
go
in
and
dine
after
which
we
must
see
about
getting
away
have
you
finished
sandy
yes
doctor
everything
is
neat
and
tidy
well
after
dinner
we
shall
be
round
to
inspect
your
arrangements
for
our
comfort
dinner
passed
over
in
comparative
silence
each
one
of
the
diners
now
fully
realised
the
solemnity
of
his
position
and
none
seemed
to
have
any
desire
to
make
their
thoughts
known
to
their
companions
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
the
ceremony
of
christening
the
carriage
was
performed
by
sandy
cracking
a
bottle
of
wine
against
the
side
and
as
the
ruddy
liquid
streamed
to
the
ground
the
doctor
pronounced
the
few
words
that
gave
to
the
machine
its
name
of
now
my
friends
the
moment
has
come
he
continued
leading
the
way
to
a
which
was
hanging
down
the
dark
side
of
the
from
the
doorway
high
overhead
let
us
bid
adieu
to
the
earth
that
bore
and
fostered
us
it
may
be
that
our
feet
touch
its
surface
for
the
last
time
the
night
was
gloriously
fine
not
a
cloud
to
hide
the
spangled
sky
sandy
and
his
dog
were
already
inside
the
and
the
scot
could
be
heard
singing
snatches
of
ballads
as
he
hurried
to
and
fro
sandy
was
evidently
little
troubled
at
the
thoughts
of
earth
this
confidence
was
inspired
by
the
calm
courage
of
his
master
graham
mounted
next
and
was
soon
busy
with
the
machinery
oiling
and
wiping
with
greatest
care
the
shining
rods
and
wheels
and
cranks
which
he
loved
almost
as
deeply
as
a
father
loves
his
children
john
temple
then
ascended
a
little
paler
perhaps
than
usual
but
calm
and
as
was
his
wont
doctor
hermann
after
carefully
walking
round
the
huge
machine
to
see
that
all
was
clear
gave
one
last
look
towards
the
old
house
and
then
to
the
hills
he
knew
and
loved
so
well
before
mounting
the
swaying
ladder
which
was
pulled
up
after
him
by
sandy
all
now
were
waiting
for
the
final
signal
which
was
to
fall
from
the
doctor
lips
he
stood
calmly
and
heroically
with
the
little
lever
grasped
in
his
right
hand
his
watch
held
in
his
left
one
minute
to
midnight
slowly
the
minute
finger
crept
round
the
tiny
dial
and
the
last
few
seconds
of
our
stay
on
earth
were
slipping
away
once
more
my
friends
i
ask
you
if
you
still
adhere
to
your
intention
of
accompanying
me
there
is
yet
time
to
draw
back
we
are
ready
and
willing
and
most
anxious
to
proceed
was
the
answer
from
all
then
our
voyage
begins
at
last
said
the
doctor
pressing
back
the
shining
lever
may
health
and
good
fortune
attend
us
on
our
journey
and
success
crown
its
termination
as
the
doctor
spoke
the
huge
machine
mounted
upwards
from
its
staging
lightly
and
buoyantly
as
a
bird
into
the
midnight
sky
all
were
exceedingly
surprised
at
the
extreme
steadiness
of
the
carriage
for
it
floated
upwards
and
onwards
without
any
disagreeable
motion
whatever
in
fact
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
the
carriage
was
moving
at
all
as
soon
as
we
got
fairly
under
way
the
doctor
suggested
that
we
should
go
out
on
the
balcony
and
take
a
last
look
at
many
old
familiar
landmarks
and
bid
a
long
farewell
to
yorkshire
we
were
travelling
very
slowly
about
sixty
miles
per
hour
and
nearly
four
miles
above
the
earth
we
soon
crossed
the
fair
vale
of
york
slumbering
peacefully
in
the
gloom
the
lights
of
towns
and
railways
being
distinctly
visible
far
below
us
we
passed
over
grimy
sheffield
with
its
gleaming
furnaces
belching
fire
and
smoke
into
the
night
its
glowing
looking
like
small
volcanoes
i
intend
to
travel
comparatively
slowly
from
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
earth
remarked
the
doctor
so
that
we
may
enjoy
the
wonderful
sight
of
that
planet
physical
features
as
viewed
from
space
ere
morning
dawns
we
shall
be
sufficiently
distant
to
get
a
view
of
the
greater
part
of
europe
by
afternoon
if
all
goes
well
our
vision
will
be
extended
to
the
entire
eastern
hemisphere
the
was
now
heading
rapidly
away
from
earth
under
superintendence
the
motors
were
hourly
increasing
their
speed
like
a
sheet
of
molten
silver
the
german
ocean
shimmered
in
the
moonlight
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
the
entire
party
of
travellers
were
soon
glad
to
return
to
the
warm
interior
of
the
where
sandy
had
made
everything
ready
for
our
comfort
it
was
now
agreed
that
each
should
take
his
turn
at
keeping
watch
and
guard
generally
for
two
hours
whilst
the
others
slept
graham
undertook
the
first
two
hours
of
this
duty
and
the
doctor
too
excited
to
sleep
remained
up
with
him
discussing
the
novelty
of
their
position
as
for
sandy
he
appeared
able
to
sleep
under
any
circumstances
and
temple
was
too
methodical
in
his
habits
to
remain
up
after
the
first
sensations
of
departure
had
worn
away
it
seems
like
a
dream
to
me
graham
that
we
are
really
off
at
last
began
the
doctor
i
have
looked
forward
to
this
time
for
many
long
and
weary
years
ah
doctor
i
can
not
describe
how
i
feel
i
am
more
than
gratified
to
see
one
who
has
done
so
much
for
me
reaping
the
harvest
he
has
sown
so
patiently
the
heavens
were
now
clouded
and
rain
began
to
fall
heavily
which
necessitated
closing
the
and
door
and
setting
the
to
work
it
was
the
doctor
intention
to
travel
as
long
as
possible
with
these
open
so
that
we
could
obtain
enough
air
from
the
atmosphere
as
long
as
it
continued
sufficiently
dense
for
our
requirements
and
thus
save
the
condensing
apparatus
as
much
wear
and
tear
as
possible
we
soon
passed
through
the
rain
clouds
and
then
the
view
from
above
them
was
entrancingly
grand
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
below
and
round
us
stretched
one
vast
silvery
expanse
of
cloud
lit
up
with
brilliant
moonbeams
and
so
solid
in
appearance
that
we
felt
a
strange
yearning
desire
to
descend
and
wander
about
the
fleecy
wastes
dawn
was
now
fast
spreading
over
the
heavens
all
through
that
night
of
excitement
the
doctor
and
graham
watched
together
but
sandy
and
temple
were
up
with
the
first
streak
of
light
the
earth
was
still
enshrouded
in
shadow
but
our
speed
had
now
to
be
increased
and
by
the
time
the
eastern
hemisphere
was
bathed
in
sunshine
we
were
travelling
a
thousand
miles
per
hour
shooting
upwards
to
the
zenith
but
drifting
meantime
nearly
south
towards
the
equator
hour
after
hour
increased
the
glorious
aspect
of
the
earth
below
which
had
the
appearance
of
a
shallow
basin
the
horizon
all
round
us
seeming
almost
level
with
the
the
earth
concave
instead
of
convex
appearance
was
a
puzzle
to
all
but
the
doctor
who
lucidly
explained
the
phenomenon
to
us
by
our
instruments
declared
our
height
above
the
earth
to
be
close
upon
eight
thousand
miles
stupendous
as
this
altitude
may
seem
none
of
our
party
experienced
the
slightest
degree
of
discomfort
so
long
as
the
condensers
were
kept
at
work
but
a
few
moments
pause
in
their
movement
produced
alarming
symptoms
especially
in
graham
whose
bulky
frame
he
stood
six
feet
eight
and
was
well
made
in
proportion
a
giant
among
men
seemed
to
require
a
larger
amount
of
air
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
as
we
rapidly
shot
upwards
at
a
speed
fifteen
times
greater
than
the
fastest
express
train
the
earth
was
constantly
changing
in
appearance
all
small
objects
were
entirely
lost
to
view
only
the
continents
largest
islands
oceans
and
seas
being
visible
the
land
and
sea
changed
colour
rapidly
until
the
former
merged
from
dark
brown
to
nearly
black
and
the
water
from
deepest
blue
to
yellow
of
such
dazzling
brightness
as
to
be
most
trying
to
the
eyes
we
could
distinctly
see
the
noble
range
of
himalayas
glittering
beautifully
in
a
dark
setting
but
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
lost
in
a
dense
bank
of
cloud
as
nearly
as
we
could
determine
we
were
now
above
the
persian
gulf
the
entire
of
the
eastern
hemisphere
could
be
followed
at
a
glance
due
north
and
south
the
polar
regions
glowed
in
dazzling
whiteness
like
two
brilliant
crescents
on
the
horizon
the
season
of
the
year
was
too
early
to
make
satisfactory
observations
of
the
northern
polar
regions
for
even
had
land
extended
to
that
pole
we
should
have
been
unable
to
detect
it
as
it
would
of
course
have
been
still
lying
deep
in
snow
the
south
polar
region
was
much
more
favourable
to
our
examination
and
beyond
the
border
of
eternal
ice
and
snow
a
dark
mass
could
be
detected
in
the
district
of
the
pole
itself
which
is
probably
land
but
at
the
immense
distance
from
which
we
viewed
it
it
was
impossible
quite
satisfactorily
to
determine
although
we
were
such
a
vast
distance
from
the
earth
she
seemed
to
be
quite
close
though
on
a
scale
and
no
words
can
describe
the
awful
grandeur
of
her
appearance
towards
evening
we
had
the
novel
experience
of
seeing
an
appalling
thunderstorm
many
thousands
of
miles
below
us
over
the
wide
expanse
of
the
indian
ocean
we
had
now
for
hours
been
depending
upon
the
air
from
our
condensers
in
fact
we
did
not
find
breathable
atmosphere
for
more
than
five
hundred
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
earth
as
the
doctor
had
predicted
the
ether
in
these
remote
regions
was
quite
dense
enough
to
be
transformed
into
air
suited
to
the
requirements
of
man
the
delight
at
all
these
wonderful
scenes
was
unbounded
his
enthusiasm
was
almost
painful
in
its
intensity
glorious
glorious
was
his
exclamation
as
he
made
rapid
notes
of
the
phenomena
around
us
he
was
too
excited
to
eat
too
full
of
his
many
experiments
to
rest
too
eager
to
gather
this
unparalleled
scientific
harvest
to
sleep
gradually
the
sun
seemed
to
sink
into
the
waste
of
waters
behind
the
western
rim
of
earth
throwing
a
lurid
glare
across
the
sea
which
now
looked
like
liquid
gold
and
then
turned
to
deepest
purple
as
the
last
rays
shot
upwards
into
immeasurable
space
faster
and
faster
we
sped
the
motors
at
last
working
to
their
utmost
limits
the
dial
registering
our
speed
at
precisely
fifteen
hundred
miles
per
hour
none
of
us
yet
experienced
the
slightest
inconvenience
either
from
the
immense
altitude
we
had
reached
or
the
terrible
velocity
with
which
we
were
travelling
upwards
by
midnight
the
doctor
calculated
our
distance
from
the
earth
to
be
miles
addressing
temple
and
graham
he
said
i
think
my
friends
that
we
ought
to
congratulate
ourselves
on
the
exceedingly
promising
state
of
our
enterprise
in
the
first
place
our
carriage
is
progressing
as
favourably
as
we
could
wish
everything
is
in
the
smoothest
working
order
our
air
is
of
the
purest
we
have
food
in
abundance
water
in
plenty
light
and
warmth
as
much
as
we
desire
hours
ago
we
were
on
the
yorkshire
fells
we
are
now
well
on
our
way
to
that
new
world
we
are
all
so
eagerly
looking
forward
to
reach
when
we
left
earth
the
planet
mars
was
glimmering
low
over
the
southern
horizon
it
is
now
in
our
zenith
we
are
fast
approaching
that
region
where
all
earthly
influence
will
be
past
and
where
the
power
of
her
gravitation
will
cease
we
inaugurate
our
voyage
with
every
prospect
of
success
i
candidly
confess
doctor
that
all
my
unpleasant
feelings
of
danger
have
passed
away
i
have
every
confidence
in
the
good
and
her
talented
inventor
remarked
temple
the
same
here
temple
said
graham
i
feel
perfectly
convinced
that
accidents
barred
of
course
we
shall
reach
our
destination
in
triumph
as
might
naturally
be
expected
in
the
clear
rarefied
atmosphere
through
which
we
were
travelling
the
various
heavenly
bodies
shone
much
more
brilliantly
than
ever
they
appear
from
earth
and
the
vast
unfathomable
vault
of
space
was
intensified
in
colour
very
different
from
the
blue
of
an
earthly
and
entirely
free
from
cloud
the
moon
was
perceptibly
larger
than
she
appears
when
viewed
from
earth
but
the
other
orbs
only
differed
in
the
intensity
and
brilliancy
of
their
light
graham

the

going
wrong

was
heard
shouting
be
calm
sandy
said
the
doctor
as
he
and
his
two
friends
hurriedly
descended
into
the
it
was
manifest
that
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
machinery
and
the
anxiety
of
all
was
plainly
visible
as
the
doctor
and
graham
hastened
to
make
an
examination
thank
heaven
the
motors
are
safe
said
graham
it
is
only
the
pin
out
of
the
rod
of
one
of
the
condensing
pistons
calmly
remarked
the
doctor
and
graham
soon
put
all
to
rights
again
some
time
elapsed
before
the
excitable
sandy
could
be
pacified
he
fully
expected
we
were
going
to
be
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
distant
earth
the
doctor
took
this
opportunity
of
pointing
out
to
us
how
necessary
it
was
to
keep
a
constant
watch
on
our
apparatus
for
the
least
mishap
might
speedily
lead
to
a
calamity
so
appalling
as
to
send
a
thrill
of
horror
to
the
stoutest
heart
amongst
us
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
chapter
iii
our
voyage
beyond
the
clouds
long
before
morning
dawned
over
earth
on
the
second
day
of
our
voyage
through
space
we
had
reached
such
an
enormous
altitude
that
even
the
outlines
of
the
continents
could
not
be
traced
with
any
degree
of
clearness
the
large
masses
of
land
were
sharply
defined
from
the
oceans
but
all
trace
of
peninsulas
isthmuses
and
islands
was
lost
the
polar
crescents
of
gleaming
snow
stood
clearly
out
in
bold
relief
but
the
waters
of
the
earth
were
becoming
very
grey
in
appearance
by
on
the
of
may
we
were
close
upon
forty
thousand
miles
above
the
earth
our
life
in
the
was
very
methodical
and
a
brief
description
of
one
day
routine
will
be
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
this
narrative
every
two
hours
of
night
the
watch
was
relieved
the
person
left
in
charge
being
responsible
for
the
safe
working
of
the
various
apparatus
at
sandy
prepared
breakfast
at
we
had
dinner
at
tea
at
supper
the
intervals
between
meals
were
passed
by
the
doctor
almost
exclusively
in
scientific
observations
writing
his
journals
and
carefully
inspecting
the
machinery
and
instruments
to
graham
was
allotted
the
task
of
keeping
all
in
order
and
compiling
a
record
of
the
distance
travelled
each
day
temple
assisted
the
doctor
in
many
of
his
labours
he
was
likewise
busy
upon
a
work
on
finance
a
great
scheme
for
liquidating
the
national
debts
of
europe
which
had
been
a
favourite
hobby
of
his
for
years
he
also
helped
to
write
much
of
the
present
journal
sandy
time
was
fully
taken
up
in
various
domestic
arrangements
and
in
looking
after
his
dog
we
usually
went
to
bed
at
but
if
anything
exceptional
occurred
we
stayed
up
later
and
sometimes
we
were
too
excited
to
go
to
rest
at
all
the
doctor
insisted
on
each
one
of
the
party
taking
a
certain
amount
of
exercise
daily
and
also
swallowing
a
small
dose
of
a
drug
of
his
own
discovery
for
the
first
week
our
voyage
was
somewhat
uneventful
each
day
we
continued
to
dash
with
stupendous
speed
towards
the
zenith
the
earth
now
was
greatly
and
rapidly
changing
in
appearance
our
nights
were
remarkably
short
and
the
period
of
sunlight
became
longer
and
longer
in
duration
we
were
soon
to
pass
beyond
the
influence
of
the
shadow
and
to
enter
a
region
of
perpetual
day
on
the
tenth
day
of
our
departure
from
earth
when
we
were
quite
miles
above
its
surface
the
moon
completed
her
sideral
revolution
and
we
saw
the
outer
surface
of
the
satellite
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
mankind
unfortunately
we
were
too
far
away
to
make
a
very
minute
examination
but
the
scene
vividly
depicted
through
the
doctor
largest
telescope
was
one
never
likely
to
be
forgotten
we
were
gazing
upon
a
new
world
the
eyes
of
mortal
man
had
never
rested
on
that
portion
of
the
surface
now
before
us
and
oh
how
different
did
it
appear
from
that
pale
orb
we
are
all
of
us
so
accustomed
to
see
lighting
the
darkness
of
earth
perhaps
it
is
well
that
her
gleaming
yellow
surface
remains
unchanged
in
aspect
to
all
mortal
eyes
her
surface
to
the
dwellers
upon
earth
has
become
a
symbol
of
peace
eloquent
of
deathly
calm
our
nights
now
became
shorter
and
shorter
with
great
rapidity
until
at
the
end
of
the
third
week
of
our
departure
from
earth
when
we
had
accomplished
a
distance
of
miles
we
reached
those
remote
regions
of
space
where
the
mighty
shadow
cast
by
our
planet
tapers
down
to
a
point
and
the
sun
in
all
his
glory
reigns
eternally
supreme
our
sensations
were
almost
beyond
description
when
the
was
at
last
fairly
launched
into
the
vast
boundless
void
of
silent
space
so
long
as
we
felt
the
influence
of
earth
and
journeyed
on
our
way
under
the
shelter
of
her
mighty
shadow
the
bonds
that
held
us
to
our
mother
world
were
still
unbroken
then
things
at
least
seemed
earthly
now
every
was
severed
surrounded
by
a
solemn
limitless
sea
of
space
unconceivable
unfathomable
filled
with
brilliant
and
eternal
light
such
as
no
man
had
beheld
before
every
one
of
us
was
filled
with
awe
and
even
the
and
dauntless
doctor
himself
was
overwhelmed
with
the
majestic
splendour
of
the
scene
around
us
we
felt
as
if
we
had
now
ceased
to
be
human
that
we
no
longer
belonged
to
earth
but
were
outcasts
with
no
home
or
bond
of
human
fellowship
away
from
our
floating
carriage
doomed
to
live
for
ever
and
to
spend
eternity
in
crossing
this
radiant
ether
sea
the
silence
was
profound
the
calmest
stillness
of
earth
is
as
the
in
comparison
with
the
quietness
of
here
the
very
beating
of
our
pulses
rang
clearly
out
on
space
the
ticking
of
our
watches
became
even
painful
in
its
loud
intensity
our
hearts
and
our
courage
began
to
fail
us
only
the
doctor
with
his
nerves
of
steel
refrained
from
uttering
words
of
regret
for
thus
rashly
leaving
earth
for
the
sake
of
prying
into
the
very
laboratory
of
the
universe
supernatural
influences
seemed
to
surround
us
we
started
as
men
we
seemed
to
be
fast
evolving
into
new
beings
governed
by
no
human
impulses
controlled
by
no
human
forces
still
the
sped
on
upwards
the
good
flashed
with
terrible
velocity
bearing
us
whither
ah
whither
when
we
became
more
familiar
with
the
vastness
around
us
the
feelings
of
dread
passed
gradually
away
the
view
from
the
windows
was
impressively
grand
the
sun
shone
with
a
brilliancy
unknown
on
earth
even
in
the
tropics
but
the
heat
was
by
no
means
oppressive
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
all
was
brilliant
yellow
light
endless
profound
we
now
derived
the
greatest
benefit
from
the
spectacles
prepared
on
the
same
principle
as
the
helioscope
which
doctor
hermann
had
provided
for
our
use
the
brilliancy
of
the
light
being
most
painful
and
trying
to
the
eyes
time
now
was
one
endless
day
of
brightest
sunshine
so
that
our
only
means
of
judging
the
hours
of
day
and
what
we
still
called
night
for
the
sake
of
convenience
was
by
the
aid
of
our
chronometers
soon
after
we
reached
these
remote
regions
of
eternal
light
we
began
to
experience
considerable
difficulty
in
breathing
at
times
this
became
so
bad
that
all
of
us
lapsed
into
a
state
of
this
caused
us
the
gravest
anxiety
and
alarm
and
as
we
sped
onwards
the
trouble
increased
clearly
something
was
going
wrong
the
terrible
thought
that
air
was
absolutely
about
to
fail
us
in
spite
of
all
the
doctor
careful
experiments
and
calculations
filled
us
with
thoughts
too
horrible
to
express
the
condensers
worked
admirably
but
driven
at
their
utmost
capacity
they
still
failed
to
furnish
sufficient
breathable
atmosphere
singularly
enough
poor
rover
felt
this
diminishing
supply
of
air
far
more
than
his
human
companions
and
for
hours
scarcely
moved
or
breathed
the
doctor
was
puzzled
graham
was
perplexed
temple
and
sandy
very
much
depressed
the
latter
especially
so
after
many
careful
experiments
and
a
thorough
examination
of
the
we
at
last
found
the
cause
in
a
loosened
window
the
remedying
of
this
necessitated
one
of
us
going
out
on
to
the
balcony
and
climbing
the
corniced
sides
graham
volunteered
the
hazardous
duty
the
doctor
with
his
usual
forethought
and
showing
how
well
he
had
his
gigantic
scheme
to
the
very
smallest
detail
and
how
carefully
he
had
provided
for
all
the
contingencies
human
intelligence
could
foresee
had
brought
with
him
a
modified
diver
helmet
with
the
attached
and
a
small
was
fastened
in
the
side
of
the
through
which
could
be
passed
this
apparatus
we
adjusted
on
graham
head
and
round
his
body
hung
a
coil
of
fine
manilla
rope
our
speed
was
now
considerably
reduced
while
the
doctor
assisted
him
to
mount
the
ladder
which
led
to
the
door
and
opened
and
closed
it
as
he
went
through
on
to
the
balcony
temple
and
sandy
worked
the
pumps
which
supplied
him
with
air
this
door
had
to
be
closed
very
quickly
to
prevent
our
own
air
escaping
we
eventually
heard
him
at
work
on
the
defective
window
and
the
great
improvement
in
the
air
of
our
chambers
was
sufficient
evidence
that
he
had
succeeded
in
his
task
still
he
did
not
return
for
quite
ten
minutes
we
were
in
the
greatest
suspense
as
to
his
movements
the
had
been
drawn
out
nearly
to
their
fullest
extent
which
was
a
singular
circumstance
and
one
that
seemed
to
bode
no
good
as
half
their
length
was
amply
sufficient
for
graham
needs
our
concern
rapidly
grew
into
absolute
alarm
for
the
safety
of
our
companion
until
at
last
we
had
the
signal
that
he
was
waiting
to
be
admitted
it
was
a
welcome
relief
to
us
all
and
sandy
could
not
refrain
from
uttering
cheer
after
cheer
of
welcome
forgetting
his
work
of
pumping
until
sternly
called
to
his
duty
by
the
doctor
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
poor
graham
fell
into
the
doctor
arms
and
for
several
hours
he
lay
unconscious
in
spite
of
all
our
remedies
and
careful
treatment
something
had
happened
and
for
an
explanation
of
the
mystery
we
had
to
wait
until
our
friend
regained
consciousness
and
was
able
to
relate
his
thrilling
story
this
he
must
tell
in
his
own
words
notwithstanding
the
still
high
rate
of
speed
at
which
we
were
travelling
i
experienced
no
inconvenience
upon
getting
to
the
balcony
began
graham
drinking
off
a
small
glass
of
strong
brandy
which
temple
insisted
on
his
taking
nor
did
i
have
any
trouble
in
climbing
up
the
ring
ladder
to
the
defective
window
the
damage
was
trifling
in
itself
and
easily
repaired
but
i
noticed
as
i
went
up
what
looked
to
be
a
long
crack
in
the
side
of
the
and
determined
to
lower
myself
down
and
examine
it
i
fastened
the
rope
to
one
of
the
rings
and
lowered
a
part
of
it
sufficiently
long
to
reach
the
supposed
crack
the
end
of
the
rope
hung
loosely
down
into
space
from
the
ring
above
i
cautiously
began
to
descend
hand
under
hand
down
the
smooth
gleaming
side
of
the
the
distance
seemed
longer
than
i
had
calculated
and
i
could
not
see
very
well
out
of
the
glasses
for
my
breath
dimmed
them
i
went
cautiously
lower
and
lower
when
to
my
utter
horror
the
bight
of
the
rope
gave
way
and
i
slipped
down
many
yards
to
find
myself
hanging
by
the
hands
alone
in
space
below
the
illustration
alone
in
space
for
one
brief
awful
moment
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
seemed
frozen
when
i
realised
the
fact
that
i
was
swinging
by
the
hands
above
the
unfathomable
gulf
of
space
thanks
to
a
nerve
which
has
never
yet
failed
me
my
presence
of
mind
did
not
forsake
me
i
tried
to
forget
what
was
below
and
to
concentrate
all
my
thoughts
on
what
was
above
above
was
safety
below
the
most
horrible
death
a
human
being
could
suffer
i
shudder
now
to
think
of
it
i
knew
it
was
no
use
to
call
for
assistance
you
had
it
not
in
your
power
to
relieve
me
not
one
of
you
could
have
lived
out
there
without
a
proper
supply
of
air
my
only
chance
rested
on
trying
to
get
back
again
a
wild
and
almost
hopeless
fight
for
life
the
ring
which
held
the
rope
had
broken
loose
and
was
hanging
at
the
end
that
saved
me
it
prevented
the
rope
slipping
from
my
grasp
as
i
fell
and
by
pulling
myself
up
a
little
way
i
got
my
feet
in
the
ring
and
relieved
the
terrible
strain
upon
my
arms
big
beads
of
perspiration
streamed
down
my
forehead
and
the
stifling
atmosphere
in
the
helmet
added
to
my
woes
as
i
realised
all
the
horrors
of
my
awful
position
then
all
the
time
i
was
tormented
with
the
possibility
of
the
breaking
and
then
ah
then
to
meet
eternity
and
fall
downwards
where
graham
your
experiences
must
have
been
unutterably
terrible
remarked
temple
the
mental
torture
of
such
a
terrible
situation
must
have
seemed
beyond
human
endurance
try
a
little
more
brandy
and
finish
your
story
later
on
when
you
feel
stronger
said
the
doctor
no
thanks
doctor
i
begin
to
feel
myself
again
and
would
like
to
relate
all
while
the
facts
are
still
fresh
in
my
memory
with
a
desperation
continued
graham
only
born
of
a
wild
desire
for
life
i
commenced
my
struggle
upwards
swinging
from
side
to
side
and
twisting
round
and
round
above
that
gleaming
yellow
gulf
whose
depths
no
mortal
could
sound
i
slowly
climbed
hand
over
hand
for
a
little
way
and
then
stopped
to
rest
i
soon
alas
realised
the
fact
that
going
down
was
much
easier
than
coming
up
and
every
moment
i
felt
my
arms
losing
strength
oh
how
horribly
smooth
and
remorseless
did
the
shining
sides
of
the
seem
not
a
projection
of
any
kind
to
assist
me
several
times
i
was
almost
giving
up
in
despair
and
ending
my
frightful
misery
by
dropping
quietly
into
the
yawning
void
below
but
the
natural
love
for
life
implanted
in
every
animate
creature
held
me
back
whilst
hope
whispered
encouragement
in
my
ears
i
could
hear
your
voices
the
sound
of
my
pulse
as
it
throbbed
on
in
its
agony
was
startlingly
distinct
i
heard
sandy
call
out
the
hour
i
had
only
been
five
minutes
in
my
dreadful
position
after
all
yet
it
seemed
ages
and
ages
suddenly
an
idea
struck
me
and
that
was
if
i
could
manage
to
hold
on
by
one
hand
with
the
other
i
might
pass
the
end
of
the
rope
under
my
foot
and
form
a
loop
this
i
succeeded
in
doing
and
was
thus
able
to
rest
my
arms
a
little
at
intervals
as
i
slowly
struggled
upwards
how
heavy
the
helmet
seemed
to
be
getting
i
felt
slowly
drifting
into
unconsciousness
and
death
in
what
seemed
to
me
an
eternity
i
at
last
reached
the
other
end
of
the
rope
which
i
had
left
hanging
loose
by
a
great
effort
i
got
this
end
through
the
ring
and
secured
it
thus
making
a
loop
in
which
i
was
able
to
stand
for
a
few
moments
and
rest
i
can
not
tell
you
how
deliciously
sweet
those
few
seconds
were
they
seemed
like
a
respite
from
the
very
jaws
of
death
i
actually
examined
the
supposed
crack
which
had
been
the
cause
of
all
my
misfortune
and
found
that
it
was
not
a
flaw
but
a
mere
scratch
in
the
outer
coating
of
the
after
this
all
was
comparatively
easy
i
soon
got
on
to
the
balcony
untied
the
rope
and
gave
the
signal
at
the
door
then
all
was
blank
my
senses
left
me
i
suppose
the
mental
strain
had
been
too
much
and
that
the
overstrung
nerves
had
collapsed
at
last
i
remembered
nothing
more
until
i
found
myself
under
your
care
and
was
surprised
to
learn
that
for
three
hours
i
had
lain
unconscious
we
all
congratulate
you
on
your
wonderful
escape
graham
said
temple
a
bottle
of
our
best
port
shall
be
uncorked
it
will
put
new
life
into
you
man
and
graham
remarked
the
doctor
you
will
perceive
that
your
perilous
undertaking
has
brought
about
good
results
the
air
we
are
now
breathing
is
all
right
again
we
have
lost
but
little
time
for
the
moment
we
knew
you
were
safe
the
motors
were
started
again
at
full
pressure
the
leakage
rejoined
graham
addressing
the
doctor
was
absurdly
trivial
yet
it
makes
one
shudder
to
think
what
would
be
the
case
did
our
air
escape
in
any
larger
quantity
it
only
shows
how
scrupulously
careful
we
must
be
and
neglect
no
precautions
for
our
safety
said
temple
the
perils
of
our
position
must
keep
each
one
of
us
alert
unforeseen
terrors
may
surround
us
at
any
moment
we
may
encounter
unknown
perils
we
may
be
rushing
into
the
midst
of
forces
that
will
require
all
our
fortitude
to
contend
against
them
we
are
in
the
midst
of
danger
and
have
to
grapple
with
any
difficulty
that
may
present
itself
without
having
the
benefit
of
any
human
experience
to
guide
us
but
we
shall
pull
through
we
shall
pull
through
my
friends
and
think
of
our
glorious
reward
remarked
doctor
hermann
working
himself
up
into
an
enthusiastic
state
of
excitement
as
he
spoke
what
are
the
results
of
your
observations
and
calculations
doctor
said
graham
i
reckon
we
are
now
one
million
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
miles
from
home
you
were
asking
me
graham
about
the
results
i
arrived
at
continued
the
doctor
briefly
they
may
be
summarised
thus
i
find
that
we
are
now
entirely
beyond
the
attractive
forces
of
the
planet
earth
we
are
now
as
it
were
in
a
neutral
position
not
yet
close
enough
to
mars
to
come
within
the
influence
of
his
attraction
four
hours
after
the
doctor
had
thus
spoken
that
is
to
say
at
twenty
minutes
past
two
in
the
afternoon
the
transit
of
earth
commenced
he
had
timed
the
occurrence
to
a
second
slowly
the
sphere
of
earth
crept
into
view
and
crossed
gradually
towards
the
centre
of
the
sun
and
finally
passed
beyond
the
disc
into
space
again
no
words
of
human
tongue
can
adequately
express
the
sensations
we
experienced
as
we
watched
the
planet
earth
now
nothing
but
a
small
dark
ball
in
appearance
travel
across
the
fiery
background
of
the
sun
to
know
that
that
mere
speck
was
a
universe
peopled
with
millions
of
living
creatures
to
know
that
that
tiny
black
disc
so
far
out
yonder
was
in
reality
a
vast
and
mighty
world
floating
in
space
yet
so
small
in
comparison
to
other
orbs
around
us
impressed
upon
our
minds
the
grand
sublimity
of
nature
works
for
many
weeks
after
the
events
recorded
in
this
chapter
the
sped
on
without
a
single
notable
occurrence
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
the
journey
our
first
christmas
day
was
observed
with
all
customary
honours
sandy
providing
us
with
a
royal
feast
and
the
evening
was
given
up
to
conviviality
and
amusement
the
doctor
and
temple
played
chess
sandy
with
his
short
pipe
and
unlimited
whiskey
now
and
then
sang
us
a
ballad
rover
lay
quietly
at
his
feet
graham
smoked
huge
cabanas
told
stories
fired
off
jokes
and
sang
many
a
yorkshire
ditty
all
of
us
felt
the
magic
spell
of
and
the
observance
of
the
festal
day
filled
our
hearts
with
renewed
hope
and
served
to
increase
and
strengthen
the
bond
of
brotherly
unity
in
our
little
party
we
were
now
miles
from
earth
or
reducing
this
vast
number
to
more
comprehensive
language
we
had
accomplished
slightly
more
than
a
quarter
of
our
journey
we
still
continued
to
find
ether
sufficiently
dense
to
be
converted
into
a
breathable
atmosphere
and
into
water
everything
promised
well
for
the
ultimate
success
of
our
daring
enterprise
alas
for
all
human
hopes
and
human
anticipations
we
little
dreamed
of
what
the
future
was
about
to
bring
chapter
iv
awful
moments
day
after
day
week
after
week
and
month
after
month
sped
the
on
its
journey
like
a
meteor
across
the
gulf
of
space
we
had
now
been
eighteen
months
away
from
earth
and
our
distance
from
that
planet
we
computed
to
be
quite
nineteen
millions
of
miles
the
earth
was
remarkably
small
in
appearance
and
the
moon
could
only
be
detected
through
a
glass
on
the
other
hand
mars
had
risen
in
elevation
and
sensibly
increased
in
brilliancy
and
apparent
size
other
heavenly
bodies
had
also
changed
considerably
in
their
aspect
some
had
got
much
larger
others
smaller
many
had
disappeared
entirely
from
our
vision
whilst
several
new
orbs
had
been
discovered
the
doctor
was
able
to
make
many
observations
of
the
asteroids
which
travel
round
the
sun
between
the
orbits
of
mars
and
jupiter
scores
of
new
ones
were
seen
for
a
long
time
doctor
hermann
had
been
worried
by
the
course
which
the
was
taking
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
were
apparently
steadily
travelling
onwards
across
the
vast
belt
of
space
between
earth
and
mars
certain
of
his
calculations
appeared
to
demonstrate
that
we
were
being
drawn
rapidly
towards
the
sun
the
quantity
of
water
we
condensed
from
the
atmosphere
now
became
very
small
and
eventually
failed
altogether
so
that
we
had
to
depend
upon
our
scanty
store
and
the
lozenges
after
an
unusually
long
and
tedious
day
the
doctor
gloomily
threw
aside
his
papers
and
his
instruments
exclaiming
to
graham
in
almost
pathetic
tones
it
is
as
i
have
long
expected
the
sun
is
too
much
for
us
but
doctor
you
may
have
erred
in
your
calculations
do
you
really
think
it
wise
to
take
such
a
pessimistic
view
of
our
situation
answered
graham
with
a
hopefulness
that
he
was
far
from
actually
feeling
if
temple
can
spare
us
a
moment
ask
him
to
join
us
and
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
our
actual
position
and
the
prospects
we
have
before
us
a
horrible
one
a
most
horrible
one
the
doctor
muttered
under
his
breath
as
graham
walked
thoughtfully
away
temple
and
graham
joined
the
doctor
almost
immediately
now
doctor
what
have
you
got
to
tell
us
this
time
what
new
discovery
have
you
made
nothing
unpleasant
i
sincerely
hope
said
temple
in
his
usual
cheery
way
my
dear
friends
began
the
doctor
i
am
afraid
i
have
bad
news
to
communicate
very
bad
news
but
let
us
look
the
situation
squarely
in
the
face
and
discuss
it
calmly
and
philosophically
as
becomes
intelligent
men
many
weeks
ago
continued
the
doctor
i
explained
to
graham
and
yourself
that
our
centre
of
gravity
had
changed
from
the
earth
to
the
sun
instead
of
earth
glimmering
at
our
feet
nineteen
millions
of
miles
below
us
we
have
the
fiery
sun
as
both
of
you
can
not
have
failed
to
observe
this
i
must
hasten
to
explain
is
cause
for
no
surprise
it
is
just
what
i
expected
would
be
the
case
until
we
came
within
the
attractive
forces
of
mars
but
my
instruments
have
demonstrated
that
our
motors
are
now
absolutely
of
no
use
they
are
working
just
as
usual
but
our
speed
increases
rather
than
diminishes
and
from
this
i
infer
we
are
influenced
by
some
vast
attractive
force
that
centre
of
attraction
to
which
we
seem
hurrying
can
only
be
the
sun
no
further
words
of
mine
are
needed
to
render
more
clear
the
horrible
doom
which
awaits
us
as
he
finished
speaking
the
doctor
rested
his
head
on
his
hand
the
usual
attitude
he
assumed
when
engaged
in
deep
thought
but
doctor
before
we
take
all
this
for
granted
at
least
let
us
satisfy
ourselves
more
completely
that
things
are
really
so
bad
said
graham
no
use
graham
no
use
i
have
studied
these
matters
too
long
and
too
carefully
needlessly
to
alarm
you
answered
the
doctor
well
doctor
said
graham
at
least
allow
me
to
stop
our
motors
then
what
you
say
can
not
possibly
be
refuted
i
think
graham
is
right
doctor
remarked
temple
it
seems
to
me
a
very
practical
suggestion
you
may
do
so
if
you
like
but
it
is
trouble
thrown
away
the
doctor
answered
graham
was
already
hastening
from
the
laboratory
down
the
steps
to
the
followed
by
his
two
friends
and
a
moment
afterwards
the
machinery
ceased
to
work
the
bright
cranks
and
wheels
and
rods
were
still
the
motors
ceased
to
revolve
at
last
this
beautiful
monument
of
engineering
skill
which
had
kept
incessantly
at
work
for
upwards
of
eighteen
months
was
stopped
and
breathlessly
the
three
men
awaited
the
result
doctor
hermann
cool
and
collected
even
in
such
awful
moments
walked
slowly
back
to
the
laboratory
to
consult
his
instruments
graham
and
temple
followed
too
excited
to
speak
well
doctor
said
temple
at
last
after
he
had
patiently
waited
his
investigation
what
are
your
conclusions
with
marvellous
coolness
as
though
answering
the
merest
commonplace
remark
doctor
hermann
replied
it
is
as
i
said
before
the
is
falling
with
speed
into
the
sun
we
are
lost
our
doom
even
if
our
speed
goes
on
increasing
can
not
overtake
us
for
several
years
continued
the
doctor
but
i
doubt
if
our
supplies
could
hold
out
for
such
a
period
doctor
broke
in
temple
excitedly
that
is
poor
comfort
you
ask
us
too
much
endurance
i
for
one
will
not
can
not
go
on
in
such
misery
only
to
be
overwhelmed
at
last
two
alternatives
are
left
to
us
we
can
either
go
on
in
a
lingering
agony
of
suspense
and
meet
our
doom
by
starvation
or
by
fire
or
we
can
end
our
woes
swiftly
and
effectually
with
these
and
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
to
the
four
revolvers
hanging
loaded
against
the
wall
we
can
but
die
like
men
i
must
confess
if
all
hope
is
really
gone
that
i
incline
to
temple
view
of
the
situation
and
would
prefer
a
sharp
and
practically
painless
death
to
it
may
be
years
of
horrible
suspense
crowned
with
the
ten
thousand
times
more
awful
fate
of
being
hurled
into
yonder
furnace
at
last
said
graham
temple
and
you
too
graham
answered
the
doctor
you
surprise
me
by
such
a
shallow
mode
of
reasoning
listen
to
me
both
of
you
are
free
agents
to
act
as
you
may
think
fit
but
before
you
rashly
take
your
lives
at
least
wait
a
little
longer
we
are
in
the
midst
of
strange
surroundings
and
still
stranger
possibilities
there
is
nothing
to
warrant
you
in
taking
such
extreme
measures
my
sentiments
doctor
must
i
suppose
be
attributed
to
my
weakness
answered
temple
you
may
taunt
me
as
you
will
said
graham
but
i
believe
there
are
rare
occasions
in
life
when
can
be
no
crime
nay
is
even
justified
then
all
i
can
say
is
that
your
ethics
are
not
mine
that
your
theology
is
not
half
the
comfort
or
support
to
you
in
your
extremity
that
my
philosophy
is
to
me
in
mine
remarked
the
doctor
once
more
said
the
doctor
let
me
bid
you
wait
let
the
motors
be
started
again
graham
at
full
pressure
some
unforeseen
occurrence
may
yet
work
our
salvation
as
time
went
on
graham
and
temple
became
more
resigned
to
their
fate
and
in
answer
to
the
doctor
urgent
entreaties
gave
him
their
promise
to
think
no
more
of
suicide
at
least
until
matters
became
more
desperate
the
doctor
never
abandoned
hope
calmly
he
bore
up
under
all
difficulties
plodding
along
with
his
instruments
and
his
calculations
writing
up
his
journals
and
making
voluminous
notes
though
every
word
he
penned
was
probably
never
destined
to
be
read
by
any
other
mortal
but
himself
during
the
twentieth
month
of
our
absence
from
earth
vast
clouds
of
meteorolites
passed
within
a
few
miles
of
us
and
at
one
time
the
whole
range
of
our
vision
was
filled
with
these
brilliant
objects
just
like
a
snowstorm
of
sparkling
fire
many
small
ones
struck
the
others
exploded
close
by
with
sharp
reports
we
were
too
much
alarmed
and
too
disconsolate
thoroughly
to
enjoy
the
glorious
sight
the
effects
being
beautiful
in
the
extreme
and
we
were
thankful
when
we
passed
beyond
this
shower
of
fire
onwards
onwards
and
onwards
we
sped
falling
with
awful
velocity
through
space
so
fast
did
we
travel
that
our
indicators
failed
to
record
the
rate
of
speed
but
still
the
sun
did
not
appear
any
closer
this
was
our
one
assuring
hope
the
doctor
was
assiduous
in
his
observations
but
could
not
arrive
at
any
definite
conclusion
a
week
before
our
second
christmas
in
the
after
a
careful
scrutiny
through
his
largest
telescope
he
joyfully
announced
that
mars
was
greatly
increasing
in
apparent
size
and
that
he
had
actually
detected
the
presence
of
two
satellites
revolving
round
the
planet
here
was
welcome
news
indeed
if
this
were
true
then
after
all
we
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
sun
after
some
further
investigation
we
were
thoroughly
convinced
of
our
safety
no
words
can
tell
our
feelings
of
thankfulness
we
felt
as
though
we
had
been
snatched
from
the
very
jaws
of
death
i
can
only
explain
our
apparent
fall
towards
the
sun
said
the
doctor
by
the
extreme
rarity
of
the
ether
around
us
this
was
not
sufficient
to
float
us
nor
to
afford
resistance
to
our
motors
hence
we
fell
into
space
instead
of
being
propelled
through
it
i
made
the
very
natural
error
of
supposing
that
some
attractive
force
was
at
work
other
than
that
exerted
by
the
planet
mars
once
more
our
prospect
is
unclouded
the
worst
part
of
the
journey
is
over
we
may
expect
at
any
time
now
to
find
our
centre
of
gravity
fixed
on
mars
at
last
then
success
may
almost
be
counted
upon
as
a
certainty
our
second
christmas
in
the
was
spent
as
happily
as
the
first
the
past
year
had
been
an
exciting
and
eventful
one
for
us
full
of
dangers
full
of
trials
and
three
of
our
party
felt
that
we
had
overcome
them
thanks
in
a
great
measure
to
doctor
hermann
skill
and
indomitable
courage
almost
daily
we
found
the
ether
around
us
becoming
more
dense
and
the
speed
of
the
sensibly
decreased
our
water
supply
once
more
became
plentiful
the
condensers
now
working
admirably
we
kept
new
year
day
as
a
great
holiday
a
day
in
our
experience
each
of
us
feeling
that
we
ought
to
inaugurate
such
an
eventful
year
in
not
only
our
own
history
but
that
of
mankind
in
a
manner
suited
to
its
vast
importance
as
the
clocks
on
earth
were
striking
midnight
on
the
of
december
and
new
greetings
were
being
exchanged
in
all
parts
of
the
world
we
had
left
four
human
beings
millions
of
miles
away
in
space
were
doing
likewise
earth
shone
steadily
like
a
pale
beautiful
star
below
us
during
the
first
few
moments
of
that
glad
new
year
we
drank
with
mild
and
boisterous
enthusiasm
to
the
planet
mars
to
the
men
on
earth
and
to
our
own
success
owing
to
the
increased
rate
of
speed
at
which
we
had
been
travelling
our
distance
from
the
earth
had
increased
much
more
than
we
had
suspected
the
doctor
computed
our
distance
from
earth
to
be
now
miles
if
all
went
well
we
should
arrive
at
mars
in
about
six
months
time
we
all
of
us
had
long
felt
weary
of
our
close
confinement
owing
to
the
strict
rules
of
hygiene
that
the
doctor
enforced
not
one
of
the
party
had
suffered
from
disease
still
it
was
a
great
joy
to
know
that
we
should
soon
be
released
from
the
and
the
wonders
of
a
new
world
were
a
rich
reward
in
store
mars
now
was
a
most
beautiful
object
in
the
heavens
long
and
often
did
we
peer
at
it
through
our
telescopes
in
wondering
astonishment
as
it
shone
in
brilliant
ruddy
glory
still
millions
of
miles
away
the
doctor
was
enchanted
with
his
discovery
of
the
satellites
of
mars
by
the
end
of
january
we
had
crossed
those
regions
of
rarefied
ether
which
were
little
more
than
an
absolute
vacuum
and
the
was
once
again
propelled
by
its
motive
forces
alone
we
now
thought
it
advisable
slightly
to
check
our
engines
and
our
speed
was
reduced
to
about
twelve
hundred
miles
per
hour
another
interesting
phenomenon
was
the
change
in
our
centre
of
gravity
which
was
now
the
planet
of
mars
this
last
great
discovery
set
all
our
doubts
at
rest
between
five
and
six
millions
of
miles
had
still
to
be
traversed
many
perils
had
still
to
be
undergone
many
difficulties
remained
to
be
overcome
but
mars
bright
glorious
ruddy
mars
was
conquered
at
last
chapter
the
glories
of
the
heavens
for
a
month
after
the
last
events
were
chronicled
the
pursued
its
way
steadily
towards
mars
without
a
single
exceptional
incident
on
the
second
of
february
however
when
we
were
about
four
and
a
quarter
millions
of
miles
from
our
destination
we
were
dreadfully
alarmed
by
a
series
of
majestic
natural
phenomena
on
the
evening
of
the
day
just
mentioned
or
rather
what
would
have
been
evening
could
we
have
distinguished
night
from
day
the
sun
for
the
first
time
since
we
left
the
shadow
of
earth
began
to
shine
less
brightly
as
the
hours
went
by
he
became
more
and
more
indistinct
just
as
he
appears
through
a
fog
on
earth
and
finally
his
fiery
rays
were
hidden
behind
vast
banks
of
cloud
the
blazing
light
now
became
a
depressing
gloom
just
as
before
a
thunderstorm
our
dog
evidently
felt
ill
at
ease
and
whined
and
trembled
as
with
great
fear
rapidly
the
gloom
increased
darker
and
darker
grew
the
fathomless
void
which
we
were
crossing
until
we
were
surrounded
by
one
vast
blackness
such
as
no
dweller
on
earth
could
ever
conceive
the
was
lighted
with
incandescent
lamps
but
these
only
served
to
make
the
awful
darkness
more
profound
this
gloom
seemed
to
enter
our
very
souls
we
could
not
only
see
it
we
could
absolutely
feel
it
the
sun
seemed
as
though
he
had
finally
burnt
himself
out
and
disappeared
for
ever
from
the
spangled
firmament
leaving
all
within
the
focus
of
his
rays
in
unutterable
chaotic
blackness
it
was
as
though
we
had
penetrated
into
the
very
womb
of
the
universe
where
no
light
could
ever
be
i
think
this
is
absolutely
the
most
dreadful
of
our
many
weird
experiences
said
temple
to
the
doctor
it
is
sublimely
grand
answered
the
doctor
and
only
shows
how
infinitely
little
man
knows
of
the
forces
of
nature
away
from
his
own
planet
doctor
there
is
something
wrong
with
our
compasses
the
needles
are
revolving
with
great
velocity
i
trust
the
presence
of
all
this
electricity
round
us
will
not
injure
any
before
graham
could
finish
the
whole
firmament
seemed
lit
up
with
a
dazzling
purple
light
and
a
moment
afterwards
we
were
struck
dumb
with
horror
at
the
awful
sound
which
followed
it
for
a
moment
the
seemed
about
to
fall
to
pieces
every
bolt
and
plate
in
her
vibrated
and
we
gave
ourselves
up
for
lost
the
frightful
explosion
was
like
nothing
heard
on
earth
ten
thousand
in
one
would
be
but
a
feeble
imitation
of
that
terrible
discharge
which
was
gone
in
a
moment
without
a
single
echo
to
mark
its
departure
far
in
the
distance
we
could
hear
mighty
cracking
sounds
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
dying
away
in
space
clap
after
clap
of
this
awful
thunder
shook
the
very
vault
of
heaven
in
their
awful
intensity
and
flash
after
flash
of
brilliant
light
lit
up
the
vast
void
across
which
we
were
travelling
how
the
escaped
utter
annihilation
amidst
all
this
mighty
display
was
a
mystery
to
us
all
it
oscillated
tremendously
as
though
at
the
mercy
of
conflicting
currents
and
reeled
like
a
ship
in
a
heavy
gale
what
appeared
to
be
glowing
meteors
rushed
by
us
with
a
deafening
roar
or
exploded
with
a
terrible
crash
vast
expanses
of
space
were
filled
with
brilliant
light
sometimes
like
glowing
mountains
and
of
fire
vast
sheets
of
blue
and
yellow
flame
rolled
up
with
a
crackling
noise
like
huge
scrolls
of
parchment
or
curled
and
twisted
into
the
most
grotesque
shapes
purple
yellow
and
blue
tongues
of
flame
shot
across
the
darkness
sometimes
silently
as
the
of
earth
but
more
often
followed
by
loud
and
sharp
reports
great
quantities
of
fine
magnetic
dust
accumulated
on
the
balcony
of
the
and
once
a
large
globe
of
purple
fire
dropped
on
the
roof
and
bounded
away
again
into
space
as
the
electrical
discharges
gradually
became
less
violent
the
whole
vault
of
space
above
us
was
lit
up
with
one
vast
aurora
whose
enchanting
glories
were
utterly
beyond
description
every
colour
of
the
rainbow
every
combination
of
colour
that
man
could
conceive
was
there
all
blended
into
one
gorgeous
flare
of
tinted
light
temple
graham
and
sandy
though
no
cowards
were
at
last
compelled
to
turn
their
amazed
and
faces
from
this
appalling
scene
but
doctor
hermann
with
blanched
cheeks
watched
the
wonderful
phenomena
cool
and
intrepid
among
all
the
fiery
strife
controlling
his
emotions
with
what
must
have
been
an
almost
superhuman
effort
of
will
throughout
this
period
of
unparalleled
darkness
our
air
was
very
bad
and
the
condensers
working
at
their
utmost
pressure
could
scarcely
keep
up
a
sufficient
supply
of
breathable
atmosphere
most
of
our
electrical
apparatus
was
thrown
out
of
order
we
were
able
to
generate
little
electricity
during
this
wonderful
phenomenon
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
store
of
this
force
we
always
had
by
us
our
engines
would
have
been
stopped
we
failed
absolutely
to
obtain
water
from
the
ether
so
long
as
we
were
surrounded
by
these
meteoric
clouds
the
view
of
the
heavens
through
our
telescope
was
now
exceedingly
beautiful
during
the
first
week
of
march
a
stupendous
comet
made
its
appearance
between
the
and
earth
and
such
was
its
exceeding
brilliancy
that
for
days
it
was
visible
to
the
naked
eye
another
uneventful
month
passed
away
the
only
occurrence
of
interest
being
the
apparently
rapidly
increasing
size
of
mars
on
the
of
april
our
distance
from
earth
was
miles
which
consequently
left
us
about
more
miles
to
travel
even
in
the
brilliant
sunlight
mars
was
visible
without
the
aid
of
a
glass
and
presented
a
singularly
beautiful
and
ruddy
aspect
we
were
as
yet
too
far
away
to
distinguish
much
of
its
physical
features
but
we
saw
enough
to
excite
our
curiosity
and
interest
to
the
very
utmost
every
available
moment
of
our
waking
hours
was
spent
in
discussing
the
physical
conditions
of
mars
and
in
making
our
plans
for
the
time
when
we
should
land
upon
its
surface
daily
we
were
more
and
more
convinced
of
the
similarity
between
the
physical
conditions
of
the
earth
and
mars
the
most
important
fact
of
all
being
the
undoubted
presence
of
an
atmosphere
of
considerable
density
the
satellites
of
mars
were
now
becoming
very
bright
and
conspicuous
the
continued
its
rapid
flight
through
space
with
uninterrupted
speed
our
time
was
mostly
spent
in
astronomical
observation
and
in
discussing
the
beauties
of
the
firmament
as
revealed
by
our
telescopes
we
never
seemed
to
tire
of
witnessing
the
glories
of
the
heavens
an
interesting
fact
which
we
could
not
fail
to
observe
was
the
apparently
much
smaller
size
of
the
sun
disc
and
a
sensible
decrease
both
in
the
amount
of
his
light
and
the
warmth
of
his
rays
life
in
the
went
uniformly
on
it
seemed
ages
since
we
were
on
earth
or
had
communion
with
our
every
day
graham
carefully
recorded
the
distance
we
had
travelled
and
made
his
report
to
the
doctor
our
machinery
still
worked
with
beautiful
precision
and
required
but
little
scrutiny
or
attention
well
doctor
said
temple
one
day
after
work
was
over
suppose
you
give
us
an
idea
of
our
distance
from
mars
and
our
probable
date
of
arrival
what
is
our
distance
for
the
past
hours
graham
asked
the
doctor
thousand
eight
hundred
miles
he
answered
then
we
are
still
travelling
at
our
reduced
speed
of
twelve
hundred
miles
per
hour
rejoined
the
doctor
well
our
last
computation
of
the
earth
distance
was
made
on
the
of
april
it
is
now
the
of
may
one
rate
of
speed
has
been
maintained
throughout
this
interval
so
that
we
are
now
miles
from
earth
and
just
miles
from
the
planet
mars
that
distance
we
shall
cover
in
a
little
over
thirty
days
if
all
goes
well
we
shall
reach
mars
on
the
of
june
your
remarks
fill
me
with
the
strangest
sensations
answered
temple
whatever
may
come
to
pass
said
the
doctor
let
me
impress
upon
you
the
importance
of
keeping
cool
and
as
free
from
excitement
as
possible
our
next
thirty
days
will
be
the
strangest
that
mortal
man
has
ever
yet
experienced
chapter
vi
we
near
mars
as
the
sped
on
its
journey
from
day
to
day
the
apparent
size
of
mars
rapidly
increased
we
began
to
feel
appalled
at
our
nearness
to
this
new
world
now
gleaming
in
brilliant
splendour
below
instead
of
above
us
our
sensations
can
not
be
expressed
on
the
of
june
we
were
again
alarmed
at
losing
sight
of
the
sun
for
a
short
time
and
expected
another
meteoric
visitation
we
began
now
anxiously
to
discuss
the
possibilities
of
finding
living
creatures
on
this
planet
it
would
indeed
be
a
disappointment
almost
beyond
human
endurance
to
find
mars
a
dead
desolate
world
after
all
but
we
took
heart
at
its
singularly
beautiful
appearance
and
its
similarity
in
many
respects
to
the
world
we
had
left
we
began
to
notice
a
considerable
difference
in
the
density
of
the
atmosphere
nearer
and
nearer
we
came
and
dumbfounded
at
our
own
temerity
hour
by
hour
and
day
by
day
we
watched
this
glorious
world
become
larger
and
larger
to
our
view
still
no
sign
of
life
could
be
traced
cold
and
still
and
calm
as
the
grave
this
new
world
appeared
to
us
the
absolutely
seemed
to
creep
along
although
the
good
machine
was
bearing
us
onward
at
a
speed
so
enormous
that
the
fastest
express
train
of
earth
was
a
snail
pace
by
comparison
amid
the
terrible
excitement
and
the
frightful
tension
of
our
nerves
which
it
entailed
the
days
sped
by
almost
unnoticed
uncounted
but
the
doctor
ever
cool
and
collected
through
all
this
trying
period
kept
a
careful
record
of
the
distance
travelled
day
by
day
as
we
approached
yet
nearer
to
this
magnificent
planet
we
were
able
to
note
most
carefully
the
general
distribution
of
land
and
water
upon
its
mighty
surface
daily
nay
hourly
now
our
hopes
of
finding
the
planet
mars
a
peopled
world
increased
it
was
three
weeks
from
the
time
that
the
doctor
had
last
dwelt
upon
the
distance
we
had
travelled
and
the
size
of
mars
was
becoming
appallingly
stupendous
on
the
evening
of
the
of
june
we
were
all
seated
in
the
chamber
above
the
admiring
the
glorious
splendours
of
the
sunset
on
this
heavenly
orb
watching
the
last
rays
of
the
martial
day
expire
as
we
had
so
often
done
before
we
were
too
absorbed
in
the
beauties
of
the
scene
before
us
to
speak
each
was
too
overcome
by
the
solemn
grandeur
of
our
surroundings
and
our
strange
position
to
converse
with
his
until
the
darkness
reached
us
at
last
and
broke
the
magic
spell
of
our
silence
temple
was
the
first
to
speak
well
doctor
things
are
rapidly
approaching
a
crisis
now
what
are
your
latest
views
on
our
position
briefly
these
temple
at
the
rate
of
speed
we
are
still
travelling
in
one
week
from
we
shall
reach
our
destination
on
that
strange
world
yonder
roughly
speaking
but
little
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
miles
remain
to
be
crossed
and
as
far
as
i
can
determine
at
present
we
shall
complete
the
last
few
thousands
of
miles
under
the
cover
of
darkness
this
is
well
for
us
it
will
enable
us
to
descend
unnoticed
and
unseen
by
any
intelligent
and
perhaps
hostile
beings
that
may
possibly
dwell
upon
the
surface
of
this
planet
on
the
other
hand
the
darkness
may
conceal
perils
we
should
have
been
able
to
avoid
had
we
descended
in
daylight
of
the
two
evils
i
strongly
counsel
us
to
choose
the
former
that
is
to
drop
quietly
down
at
night
and
await
the
dawn
in
concealment
our
future
movements
must
be
controlled
entirely
by
events
the
following
six
days
were
passed
without
anything
unusual
occurring
at
dawn
on
the
seventh
we
were
only
about
miles
away
from
mars
and
his
vast
size
inspired
our
hearts
with
increasing
awe
our
last
day
in
the
if
all
went
well
had
now
arrived
at
five
the
planet
began
to
assume
a
slightly
concave
appearance
at
six
this
became
even
more
pronounced
whilst
an
hour
later
still
when
we
were
only
about
six
thousand
miles
above
its
surface
the
horizon
seemed
almost
level
with
the
mars
now
looked
like
a
huge
deep
saucer
into
which
we
were
rapidly
falling
at
eight
in
the
evening
as
near
as
we
in
our
terrible
state
of
excitement
could
judge
for
not
one
of
us
referred
to
our
watches
all
doubts
respecting
the
presence
of
life
on
mars
were
expelled
and
to
our
indescribable
joy
we
noted
dark
belts
of
vegetation
in
which
the
glittering
mountains
and
active
volcanoes
were
set
each
minute
the
scene
below
us
became
more
grandly
beautiful
at
a
thousand
miles
above
mars
we
found
we
could
dispense
with
our
condensers
and
actually
sustain
life
with
the
atmosphere
admitted
into
the
this
was
encouraging
more
so
than
ever
we
had
even
dared
to
hope
mars
already
was
beginning
to
supply
every
requirement
of
the
children
of
the
earth
we
now
deemed
it
advisable
to
reduce
our
speed
somewhat
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
we
could
not
have
been
much
more
than
a
hundred
miles
above
this
new
world
we
now
climbed
out
on
to
the
balcony
and
peering
down
into
the
dark
depths
it
was
apparent
to
us
all
that
the
was
over
dry
land
although
a
large
sheet
of
water
was
visible
in
the
distance
shimmering
in
the
moonlight
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
good
was
hovering
a
thousand
feet
above
the
martial
planet
and
we
began
making
the
few
final
preparations
for
our
descent
upon
its
surface
chapter
vii
our
arrival
and
safe
descent
as
the
gradually
descended
the
last
few
hundred
feet
sandy
was
busy
getting
out
the
rope
ladder
graham
confined
his
attention
to
the
motors
and
steering
apparatus
whilst
on
the
balcony
temple
and
the
doctor
kept
a
close
watch
the
latter
on
the
alert
for
every
possible
contingency
and
from
time
to
time
calling
out
instructions
to
graham
for
his
guidance
we
all
of
us
remarked
the
greater
buoyancy
of
the
in
the
lower
martial
atmosphere
than
was
the
case
in
that
of
the
earth
and
our
descent
was
slow
and
easy
in
the
extreme
in
fact
so
buoyant
had
the
become
that
we
had
great
fears
of
ever
reaching
ground
at
all
without
assistance
from
below
but
eventually
the
good
settled
down
through
a
dense
growth
of
vegetation
of
some
kind
snapping
tall
tapering
stems
like
straws
crashing
through
giant
reeds
like
so
many
grass
stalks
and
then
sinking
for
a
couple
of
feet
into
the
soft
slimy
soil
of
what
was
evidently
a
dismal
swampy
jungle
here
at
last
the
came
to
rest
amidst
a
forest
of
mighty
stems
whose
branches
met
overhead
and
formed
a
gloomy
bower
above
and
around
it
we
now
armed
ourselves
with
our
revolvers
and
before
attempting
to
pass
down
the
ladder
one
end
of
which
was
already
lying
on
the
ground
each
one
felt
that
to
doctor
hermann
the
honour
justly
belonged
of
being
the
first
to
set
foot
on
this
new
world
and
accordingly
he
led
the
way
down
the
steps
into
the
gloom
carrying
a
powerful
electric
followed
by
temple
and
graham
sandy
with
poor
old
rover
in
his
arms
bringing
up
the
rear
the
air
soon
began
to
have
a
most
remarkable
and
exhilarating
effect
upon
us
all
each
one
felt
a
buoyancy
of
spirits
a
sense
of
lightness
and
an
increase
of
physical
strength
never
known
before
these
effects
we
rightly
attributed
to
the
specific
gravity
of
mars
which
is
so
much
less
than
that
of
earth
they
were
intensely
exciting
moments
for
us
as
one
by
one
we
climbed
down
the
sides
of
the
fighting
our
way
through
the
vegetation
which
clustered
around
us
until
the
bottom
rung
of
the
ladder
was
reached
and
we
felt
the
ground
of
a
new
world
beneath
our
feet
but
the
country
where
we
had
chanced
to
descend
was
sullen
and
uninviting
even
the
light
from
the
martial
moons
shining
so
fairly
high
up
in
the
dark
blue
sky
failed
to
penetrate
the
dismal
shadows
of
this
swampy
wilderness
whilst
the
lurid
reflection
in
the
heavens
from
a
distant
crater
only
intensified
the
horrible
scene
of
gloom
but
amid
the
shadows
and
the
vapours
of
this
reeking
marsh
we
could
see
sufficient
with
our
lamp
to
tell
us
that
we
were
surrounded
by
vegetation
totally
different
from
anything
we
had
left
behind
us
on
earth
the
reeds
were
stupendous
with
fluted
and
flattened
stems
eighteen
inches
in
width
rising
straight
as
arrows
from
the
stagnant
water
their
crowns
lost
to
view
in
the
night
haze
and
mingling
together
far
above
the
roof
of
the
the
malarious
vapours
rising
from
the
stagnant
water
and
the
rotting
vegetation
were
deadly
in
their
subtleness
and
in
spite
of
our
excitement
and
curiosity
doctor
hermann
insisted
for
our
health
sake
that
we
should
return
to
the
a
night
amidst
such
poisonous
gases
might
have
stricken
each
one
of
us
down
with
a
fatal
fever
it
was
well
that
we
did
so
for
before
morning
dawned
the
dangers
of
our
position
were
manifested
in
various
startling
ways
soon
huge
banks
of
black
clouds
spread
across
the
sky
like
shrouds
and
drops
of
rain
began
to
patter
on
the
windows
my
friends
said
doctor
hermann
the
best
advice
i
can
give
is
that
we
stay
inside
the
until
dawn
sandy
had
better
prepare
us
some
food
we
have
not
eaten
for
the
past
eight
hours
and
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
that
we
take
every
care
of
ourselves
for
we
may
have
our
strength
and
endurance
put
to
the
severest
tests
in
the
near
future
besides
this
marsh
is
full
of
pestilence
we
can
not
be
too
careful
and
further
from
the
closeness
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
look
of
the
heavens
i
predict
a
storm
within
the
next
hour
or
so
you
are
quite
right
doctor
rejoined
temple
whilst
sandy
as
became
the
dutiful
servant
he
was
began
to
act
on
the
doctor
wishes
and
very
soon
had
spread
before
us
a
right
royal
repast
which
bore
ample
testimony
not
only
to
his
culinary
skill
but
to
the
still
ample
resources
of
our
larder
a
bottle
of
our
best
wine
was
uncorked
in
honour
of
the
occasion
and
we
sat
down
to
do
justice
to
what
temple
called
our
triumphal
feast
convivial
and
merry
was
our
meal
notwithstanding
the
dismal
surroundings
and
so
gay
and
did
we
feel
that
even
the
reeking
swamp
was
toasted
for
after
all
in
spite
of
its
gloom
and
its
pestilential
breath
it
was
the
first
ground
to
echo
our
on
this
new
world
one
more
bottle
of
wine
my
comrades
said
temple
as
soon
as
our
meal
was
over
and
let
sandy
have
a
double
allowance
of
whisky
we
must
inaugurate
the
termination
of
our
journey
in
a
right
festive
way
what
a
triumph
for
science
for
electricity
in
particular
we
have
won
said
doctor
hermann
here
to
our
continued
success
and
to
the
people
of
mars
if
such
there
be
but
before
the
doctor
could
complete
his
toast
the
whole
apartment
was
filled
with
a
lurid
flash
of
bluish
light
and
before
we
could
recover
from
our
surprise
the
vault
of
heaven
was
shaken
by
an
appalling
peal
of
thunder
the
storm
is
on
us
doctor
exclaimed
graham
and
to
all
appearance
it
is
far
too
close
to
be
pleasant
a
few
moments
after
another
and
a
brighter
flash
of
lightning
lit
up
the
gloomy
swamp
and
almost
simultaneously
the
thunder
bellowed
out
in
a
quick
succession
of
cracking
reports
dying
away
in
rumblings
and
growlings
which
were
tossed
from
echo
to
echo
in
the
wilderness
then
down
came
the
rain
in
a
drowning
deluge
roaring
on
the
foliage
and
churning
the
surface
of
the
sleeping
lake
into
a
torrent
of
bubbling
boiling
foam
towards
the
end
of
the
storm
we
had
another
surprise
which
filled
us
with
the
direst
alarm
an
exclamation
from
temple
brought
us
all
to
the
window
of
the
which
overlooked
the
lake
with
blanched
face
and
eyes
fixed
intently
upon
the
water
he
pointed
to
the
seething
pool
tell
me
if
i
am
mad
or
dreaming
he
shouted
in
his
terror
illustration
its
huge
scaly
carcass
truly
indeed
his
alarm
was
not
without
cause
for
there
coming
slowly
from
the
water
on
to
the
shore
and
in
the
direction
of
the
was
the
first
representative
we
had
seen
of
animal
life
in
mars
how
shall
we
attempt
to
describe
this
hideous
amphibious
monster
as
it
appeared
lit
up
by
the
almost
incessant
flashes
of
lightning
only
its
enormous
head
and
forequarters
were
yet
visible
a
huge
scaly
carcase
mapped
out
with
phosphorescent
light
a
head
with
pointed
snout
and
with
two
monstrous
eyes
attached
to
shafts
about
a
foot
in
length
which
in
the
brief
intervals
of
darkness
shone
like
balls
of
fire
raising
its
head
on
its
long
pliant
neck
it
sniffed
the
air
as
if
in
anger
and
then
began
to
crawl
out
of
the
pool
yard
after
yard
of
its
repulsive
body
emerging
its
head
nearly
reaching
the
before
its
tapering
tail
was
drawn
from
the
water
we
could
hear
the
grinding
crunching
sound
of
its
scaly
body
as
it
was
slowly
drawn
along
the
swampy
ground
and
so
near
had
it
come
to
us
that
we
could
see
a
coarse
bushy
mane
hanging
round
its
lower
neck
in
dripping
folds
the
hideous
reptile
for
such
we
must
call
it
passed
on
without
noticing
the
although
we
felt
its
rough
scaly
body
rub
against
the
sides
and
as
its
hideous
mighty
coils
disappeared
into
the
gloomy
swamp
leaving
a
luminous
slimy
track
behind
them
we
could
detect
huge
protuberances
like
warts
along
its
back
here
and
there
varied
with
spiky
fins
which
were
from
time
to
time
as
though
the
horrible
creature
were
about
to
engage
in
combat
doctor
said
temple
in
his
alarm
if
this
is
a
fair
sample
of
the
creatures
we
have
come
to
live
amongst
i
really
think
it
time
we
began
to
think
about
getting
back
again
i
do
like
the
idea
of
such
neighbours
at
all
besides
we
may
yet
meet
with
monsters
more
terrible
still
and
what
is
of
greater
importance
to
us
we
may
not
escape
their
notice
so
easily
next
time
we
should
require
an
army
to
protect
us
from
such
creatures
as
this
gently
gently
temple
you
are
not
a
naturalist
and
can
not
be
expected
to
feel
my
enthusiasm
no
less
than
nine
of
these
terrible
monsters
came
from
the
lake
during
the
hour
that
we
watched
and
all
took
the
same
beaten
track
into
the
swamps
that
the
first
had
followed
and
we
saw
them
no
more
temple
could
scarcely
conceal
a
shudder
as
he
looked
at
the
now
placid
water
ah
he
exclaimed
who
would
have
dreamed
that
such
creatures
were
lying
beneath
its
surface
certainly
the
doctor
alarmed
us
when
we
heard
him
coolly
bidding
sandy
to
seek
and
slaughter
these
loathsome
creatures
sandy
said
he
you
must
get
me
one
of
those
serpents
to
morrow
it
will
be
most
interesting
to
dissect
so
magnificent
a
type
of
the

replied
deprecatingly
doctor

request

sandy
wanting

graham
assuming
an
air
of
mock
gravity

he
spoke

laughing

we
best
not

wi
the
likes
o
them
well
sandy
said
the
doctor
you
must
have
had
sufficient
experience
of
me
by
this
time
to
know
that
i
never
ask
a
man
to
do
anything
i
am
afraid
to
do
myself
i
spoke
thoughtlessly
and
will
do
the
killing
myself
by
the
time
these
reptiles
had
passed
out
of
sight
the
storm
had
subsided
sleep
was
beyond
us
the
sight
of
these
reptiles
alone
was
enough
to
keep
us
awake
for
a
week
we
longed
oh
how
we
longed
for
the
dawn
but
more
surprises
were
in
store
for
us
ere
that
eventful
night
had
passed
away
the
awful
storm
seemed
to
have
stirred
into
activity
the
wild
beasts
of
this
lonesome
marsh
and
many
curious
cries
resounded
from
its
depths
now
a
muffled
yell
or
a
chorus
of
loud
bellowings
would
be
heard
as
if
some
gigantic
creatures
were
fighting
each
other
to
the
death
then
more
musical
calls
would
break
the
oppressive
stillness
here
there
and
everywhere
from
the
thickets
they
came
but
the
animals
that
produced
them
were
invisible
in
the
gloom
our
curiosity
was
excited
to
the
utmost
limits
of
human
endurance
it
must
have
been
about
an
hour
before
the
dawn
when
we
were
terrified
beyond
all
description
by
a
crash
against
one
of
the
windows
of
the
followed
by
a
moan
as
of
pain
so
appalling
so
unearthly
that
our
very
blood
seemed
to
curdle
with
horror
even
doctor
hermann
himself
was
visibly
disconcerted
perhaps
it
was
owing
to
the
highly
wrought
state
of
our
nerves
but
all
of
us
for
the
moment
were
too
to
move
in
the
doctor
case
the
alarm
was
only
momentary
and
with
intrepid
courage
he
rushed
to
the
broken
window
firing
a
couple
of
shots
from
his
revolver
at
some
dread
shape
struggling
to
enter
the
apartment
the
doctor
was
a
poor
hand
with
such
a
weapon
both
bullets
missed
their
mark
and
before
a
third
shot
could
be
fired
the
frightful
creature
had
vanished
moan
after
moan
was
heard
now
near
then
far
away
in
the
distance
sounding
more
like
the
voices
of
tortured
souls
than
of
any
material
being
in
a
few
moments
another
of
these
mysterious
creatures
appeared
and
this
time
we
watched
it
approach
with
rapt
astonishment
as
it
floated
through
the
air
in
the
full
focus
of
the
rays
from
our
electric
lamps
no
creature
of
earth
possesses
such
means
of
locomotion
it
looked
like
a
huge
dark
ball
perhaps
six
feet
in
diameter
and
as
it
came
towards
us
we
noticed
that
it
was
revolving
with
enormous
rapidity
forcing
its
way
through
the
air
evidently
on
the
same
principle
as
a
in
the
water
graham
had
by
this
time
regained
his
and
with
his
rifle
in
hand
as
this
monster
approached
he
said
doctor
shall
i
fire
yes
graham
by
all
means
but
be
absolutely
sure
of
your
aim
before
doing
so
almost
before
the
doctor
had
finished
speaking
the
crack
of
rifle
rang
out
but
the
animal
continued
its
course
and
came
with
a
crash
against
the
the
shot
had
told
nevertheless
and
we
heard
its
body
fall
through
the
reeds
and
drop
with
a
heavy
thud
on
the
spongy
ground
well
done
graham
a
splendid
shot
he
doon
he
doon
sang
out
sandy
at
the
top
of
his
voice
evidently
both
pleased
and
comforted
beyond
measure
to
see
that
these
strange
beings
we
had
come
amongst
were
not
proof
against
earthly
powder
and
ball
chapter
viii
a
strange
world
in
the
grey
dawn
of
morning
the
weather
began
to
clear
white
fogs
hung
low
over
the
densest
parts
of
the
swamp
but
near
the
the
mist
lifted
and
the
sky
was
visible
we
now
climbed
out
on
to
the
balcony
and
though
nearly
surrounded
with
the
giant
reeds
we
had
a
fairly
good
view
of
the
range
of
mountains
which
extended
beyond
the
lake
with
the
break
of
day
the
tumultuous
carnival
of
the
wild
beasts
inhabiting
the
marsh
came
to
an
end
and
their
cries
gradually
ceased
buried
as
we
were
among
the
dense
marshy
forest
we
could
not
be
absolutely
certain
but
so
far
as
we
could
judge
the
country
seemed
more
open
beyond
the
lake
we
had
evidently
descended
just
on
the
outskirts
of
the
swamp
which
was
apparently
connected
with
the
lake
and
formed
part
of
a
vast
plain
extending
to
the
mountains
the
lowest
of
these
we
computed
to
be
about
twelve
miles
away
as
we
were
thus
doing
our
best
to
make
out
a
little
of
the
country
round
us
the
distant
became
illumined
with
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
the
snow
upon
their
highest
summits
gleamed
like
burnished
silver
in
the
light
and
as
the
morning
broke
the
clouds
reflected
a
rosy
radiance
of
rare
beauty
the
dawn
on
mars
was
very
similar
to
the
dawn
on
earth
and
as
we
watched
the
sunlight
leap
from
peak
to
peak
and
the
heavens
change
from
one
glorious
hue
to
another
we
could
have
fancied
ourselves
watching
some
of
the
many
magnificent
sunrises
we
had
seen
in
the
alps
or
on
the
lofty
himalayas
it
really
appeared
as
though
all
the
animal
life
of
mars
was
nocturnal
for
with
the
break
of
day
not
a
trace
of
a
living
creature
could
be
seen
or
heard
all
was
silent
as
the
grave
the
wind
had
dropped
and
not
even
the
feathery
crowns
of
the
giant
reeds
moved
everything
was
still
our
future
movements
were
of
such
importance
that
even
hermann
restrained
his
eager
curiosity
to
examine
the
strange
beast
graham
had
shot
and
which
was
lying
dead
somewhere
outside
the
and
suggested
that
as
soon
as
we
had
breakfasted
we
should
consult
together
as
to
what
was
best
to
be
done
the
meal
was
quickly
over
none
of
us
having
much
inclination
to
eat
after
the
excitement
of
the
previous
night
it
is
now
time
that
we
began
seriously
to
discuss
our
future
movements
remarked
the
doctor
rising
from
the
table
and
leading
the
way
to
the
laboratory
whither
we
usually
retired
as
soon
as
our
meals
were
over
there
is
much
for
us
to
consider
and
decide
the
sun
was
now
well
up
in
the
heavens
the
sky
was
blue
and
cloudless
as
on
earth
whilst
two
of
the
martial
moons
could
be
seen
pale
and
lustreless
above
us
their
rays
were
appreciably
less
powerful
and
brilliant
while
the
doctor
and
temple
made
notes
and
prepared
for
departure
graham
went
down
on
to
mars
to
search
for
his
game
but
he
sought
in
vain
it
had
disappeared
entirely
a
few
splashes
of
blood
were
to
be
seen
on
the
sides
of
the
and
a
small
pool
of
the
same
marked
the
spot
where
it
had
fallen
some
kind
of
creature
hunting
in
the
swamp
for
prey
had
carried
it
off
and
we
saw
it
no
more
graham
disappointment
was
only
excelled
by
the
doctor
but
they
consoled
themselves
by
the
thought
that
they
would
soon
obtain
other
specimens
as
curious
and
as
interesting
we
were
all
of
us
eager
to
get
away
from
the
swamp
and
as
soon
as
graham
returned
the
doctor
gave
the
order
to
start
but
the
motors
sped
round
to
no
purpose
the
was
held
fast
in
the
treacherous
mud
as
in
a
vice
and
the
force
of
suction
was
so
great
that
we
found
it
would
be
impossible
to
move
until
we
had
dug
out
that
portion
which
was
buried
in
the
slimy
ground
we
were
however
too
eager
to
see
something
of
our
new
world
to
stay
and
do
this
and
we
ultimately
agreed
to
set
out
and
explore
the
country
round
about
on
foot
we
armed
ourselves
with
rifles
knives
revolvers
and
plenty
of
ammunition
whilst
sandy
carried
sufficient
food
for
our
needs
during
the
day
how
can
we
describe
our
sensations
as
one
by
one
we
climbed
down
from
the
and
headed
by
the
doctor
trooped
off
in
indian
file
towards
the
shore
of
the
adjacent
lake
stumbling
struggling
and
wading
through
the
swampy
forest
full
of
expectancy
and
not
without
a
certain
amount
of
dread
as
to
what
might
befall
us
in
this
strange
world
our
dog
bounded
and
barked
with
wildest
delight
on
regaining
his
freedom
and
so
noisy
did
he
become
that
we
had
to
tie
him
up
and
sandy
led
him
any
disinterested
spectator
would
have
thought
us
a
queer
party
and
truly
we
looked
so
for
somehow
we
felt
as
strangers
in
a
strange
land
and
out
of
place
with
all
that
surrounded
us
nothing
inspired
this
feeling
to
so
great
an
extent
as
the
effect
which
the
much
lower
specific
gravity
of
mars
than
earth
had
upon
us
we
felt
too
small
for
our
new
home
and
such
was
the
result
of
this
that
we
were
able
to
perform
feats
of
jumping
and
leaping
that
would
have
made
the
athletic
champions
of
earth
turn
green
with
envy
even
staid
and
elderly
doctor
hermann
thought
nothing
of
taking
a
leap
of
ten
or
twelve
feet
and
our
heavy
clumsy
collie
dog
rover
seemed
transformed
into
a
greyhound
so
active
and
light
of
foot
was
he
we
felt
in
much
better
spirits
than
we
had
done
for
years
younger
stronger
more
daring
and
courageous
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
reach
the
lake
but
the
prospect
disappointed
us
round
the
shores
as
far
as
we
could
see
the
forest
of
reeds
extended
but
beyond
the
lake
far
away
to
the
westward
the
country
was
more
elevated
and
promising
it
was
vain
to
attempt
to
get
round
the
shore
through
such
a
swampy
wilderness
and
baffled
we
had
to
retrace
our
footsteps
before
leaving
the
lake
however
we
ascertained
that
the
water
was
fresh
and
of
excellent
quality
we
will
not
be
graham
after
all
remarked
the
doctor
we
will
go
back
to
the
and
get
out
our
boat
she
will
carry
the
four
of
us
comfortably
enough
a
capital
idea
doctor
i
quite
forgot
our
boat
exclaimed
temple
we
returned
at
once
to
the
and
got
out
the
boat
which
we
all
helped
to
carry
through
the
reeds
to
the
water
some
little
time
was
spent
in
putting
the
various
parts
together
but
when
all
was
finished
our
little
craft
looked
splendid
and
delighted
us
with
her
buoyancy
and
stability
as
soon
as
all
was
ready
we
embarked
upon
this
unknown
lake
sandy
and
graham
rowing
temple
steering
and
the
doctor
keeping
a
sharp
generally
our
dog
curled
himself
up
under
a
seat
in
the
stern
and
went
to
sleep
it
was
some
time
before
we
got
out
far
enough
to
see
much
of
the
surrounding
country
and
when
we
did
so
the
prospect
was
by
no
means
an
encouraging
one
a
vast
forest
of
reeds
intermingled
with
large
trees
whose
smooth
trunks
we
had
already
examined
with
astonishment
extended
for
miles
and
miles
round
the
margin
of
the
water
all
seemed
desolate
not
a
living
creature
could
be
heard
or
seen
a
light
breeze
now
began
to
ruffle
the
surface
of
the
lake
and
this
we
took
advantage
of
by
hoisting
our
slender
mast
and
also
a
small
lug
sail
which
carried
us
along
famously
without
the
fatigue
of
rowing
by
the
doctor
advice
temple
steered
nearly
due
west
towards
the
mountains
and
as
we
sailed
along
the
country
assumed
a
more
inviting
appearance
the
dense
fringe
of
reeds
gradually
became
broken
and
drier
ground
was
marked
by
small
hills
and
tall
trees
of
graceful
outline
and
dense
red
foliage
which
gleamed
very
brilliantly
as
the
sun
shone
full
upon
them
objects
on
the
opposite
shore
became
more
and
more
distinct
and
we
were
able
to
detect
a
great
variety
of
trees
and
shrubs
clothing
the
sides
of
the
valleys
which
extended
gently
upwards
from
the
lake
into
the
heart
of
the
distant
mountains
we
sailed
steadily
along
the
doctor
picking
up
a
large
red
leaf
which
was
floating
on
the
water
as
we
passed
by
it
was
about
eighteen
inches
long
from
point
to
stem
and
the
same
in
width
perfectly
diagonal
in
shape
its
tissues
appeared
much
the
same
as
those
composing
the
leaves
of
earthly
trees
once
the
enormous
flat
head
of
some
peeped
above
the
surface
and
sank
again
nothing
further
of
interest
occurred
until
we
reached
the
shore
although
sandy
declared
that
he
saw
a
large
bird
flying
along
but
as
none
of
the
rest
observed
it
we
concluded
that
he
was
probably
mistaken
the
bed
on
this
side
of
the
lake
was
much
deeper
than
on
the
other
and
the
bottom
was
rocky
the
water
was
remarkably
clear
and
we
could
see
many
beautiful
plants
of
strange
shapes
the
like
of
which
we
had
never
seen
before
waving
to
and
fro
in
the
crystal
depths
some
were
like
long
lengths
of
ribbon
others
were
poised
on
tapering
stems
whilst
others
yet
again
were
composed
of
long
slender
twigs
with
no
foliage
but
a
bright
scarlet
ball
about
as
big
as
a
pigeon
egg
on
the
extremity
of
each
a
very
beautiful
little
plant
with
a
light
red
scaly
leaf
covered
most
of
the
rocks
on
shore
and
many
of
the
pebbles
which
strewed
the
beach
were
exceptionally
fine
and
brilliant
some
shone
like
emeralds
and
were
almost
as
clear
as
that
gem
here
the
doctor
was
in
his
glory
indeed
he
fell
down
on
his
knees
upon
the
shore
as
soon
as
his
feet
touched
dry
ground
and
absolutely
revelled
in
the
beautiful
pebbles
as
a
miser
would
in
his
gold
taking
them
up
by
handfuls
and
dropping
them
one
by
one
through
his
fingers
temple
he
shouted
in
his
enthusiasm
temple
these
stones
are
not
of
earth
they
are
new
fairer
far
than
earthly
riches
more
beautiful
more
precious
than
all
the
gems
of
earth
combined
for
not
all
of
them
could
purchase
one
of
these
the
shore
where
we
landed
was
for
some
distance
inland
rough
beyond
the
belt
of
shrubs
were
groves
and
forests
extending
far
up
the
mountain
slopes
and
the
trees
which
composed
them
were
truly
magnificent
many
were
evidently
nondeciduous
the
foliage
of
nearly
all
was
dark
red
but
here
and
there
a
smaller
tree
with
blue
leaves
and
green
flowers
stood
out
in
bold
relief
from
the
rest
many
of
them
were
loaded
with
products
hundreds
of
pounds
in
weight
and
in
colour
shaped
something
like
gourds
they
were
extremely
acrid
to
the
taste
but
a
pink
berry
about
the
size
of
a
walnut
on
a
plant
was
sweet
and
deliciously
flavoured
it
would
take
up
far
too
much
of
the
space
allotted
by
us
for
this
narrative
to
attempt
to
describe
a
tithe
of
the
wonderful
and
curious
types
of
vegetation
we
found
in
this
fair
land
of
promise
where
everything
we
looked
at
was
new
to
our
eyes
absolutely
new
and
our
exclamations
of
surprise
and
admiration
were
almost
incessant
we
felt
as
dwellers
in
a
country
village
must
feel
upon
seeing
the
wonders
of
a
great
metropolis
for
the
first
time
but
the
day
was
passing
on
and
at
noon
we
returned
to
the
shore
and
rigging
up
a
shelter
from
the
sun
with
our
sail
we
made
a
fire
of
some
driftwood
on
the
beach
and
prepared
our
meal
sandy
had
loaded
himself
with
fruit
and
berries
of
various
kinds
which
he
proceeded
to
distribute
by
way
of
dessert
but
the
doctor
advised
us
not
to
eat
them
until
their
properties
were
better
known
to
us
it
was
hard
to
resist
such
tempting
luscious
fare
when
we
were
hot
and
parched
yet
we
left
them
untouched
wisely
or
unwisely
and
quenched
our
thirst
at
the
lake
whilst
enjoying
our
smoke
and
discussing
the
events
of
the
morning
we
were
startled
by
a
singularly
rich
and
beautiful
song
as
of
a
sweet
flute
which
issued
from
a
bush
clothed
in
bloom
just
behind
us
a
bird
i
do
declare
excitedly
exclaimed
the
doctor
and
one
of
exceptionally
sweet
song
too
answered
temple
both
rising
to
their
feet
as
they
spoke
but
nothing
could
be
seen
and
for
several
minutes
the
delicious
music
was
hushed
doctor
it
is
na
bird
at
a
it
is
a
butterfly
see
there
he
is
shouted
sandy
pointing
as
he
ran
to
a
small
bush
twenty
paces
ahead
goodness
gracious
exclaimed
the
doctor
in
astonishment
i
believe
sandy
is
right
and
right
he
was
for
certain
for
this
singing
insect
fluttered
lazily
along
to
a
bush
much
nearer
to
us
and
poising
on
one
of
the
topmost
blooms
again
warbled
as
sweetly
as
before
truly
indeed
said
the
doctor
in
amazement
we
have
reached
a
world
of
anomalies
to
all
intents
and
purposes
that
is
a
butterfly
yet
its
structure
must
be
entirely
different
from
any
insect
on
earth
or
known
to
man
others
now
appeared
their
wings
were
of
various
colours
and
shapes
denoting
probably
several
species
but
one
with
light
pinions
was
by
far
the
commonest
soon
after
we
saw
the
insects
a
flock
of
white
birds
about
the
size
of
a
thrush
appeared
flying
quickly
along
the
side
of
the
lake
in
a
very
swallowlike
manner
one
of
them
graham
was
fortunate
enough
to
shoot
and
we
were
surprised
beyond
measure
to
find
that
it
was
without
legs
and
pouched
like
the
marsupalia
or
kangaroos
of
earth
in
the
pouch
were
several
pinkish
eggs
and
we
inferred
that
this
creature
hatched
them
as
it
carried
them
about
the
air
requiring
no
nest
for
the
purpose
it
was
clothed
in
plumage
more
like
scales
than
feathers
the
filaments
being
similar
to
fine
shreds
of
horn
many
other
species
of
these
curious
legless
birds
and
singing
insects
were
seen
by
us
as
we
strolled
along
the
shore
just
however
as
we
were
about
to
embark
a
magnificent
animal
trotted
down
one
of
the
valleys
to
the
lake
to
drink
it
was
certainly
three
times
as
big
as
the
largest
elephant
though
slim
and
graceful
of
build
as
a
fawn
here
all
further
resemblance
ceased
it
was
something
like
a
greyhound
in
appearance
but
the
ears
were
broad
and
very
large
and
the
dark
eye
exceptionally
prominent
its
tail
was
long
and
bushy
its
hoof
uncloven
and
the
colour
of
the
skin
was
as
dull
copper
we
were
too
much
lost
in
admiration
of
the
beautiful
creature
to
shoot
it
down
and
before
we
had
recovered
from
our
surprise
it
bounded
away
towards
the
mountains
with
amazing
speed
we
subsequently
counted
eight
more
of
these
animals
grazing
on
the
patches
of
red
grass
on
the
lower
hills
respecting
the
inhabitants
of
this
new
world
said
the
doctor
really
its
fauna
and
flora
so
far
as
we
have
observed
them
are
simply
grand
bar
the
serpents
doctor
said
graham
more
than
satisfied
said
temple
i
am
charmed
and
delighted
and
now
share
your
conviction
that
a
higher
type
of
animal
still
remains
to
be
discovered
you
know
to
what
i
refer
creatures
of
intellect
formed
in
the
image
of
god
like
ourselves
we
had
best
now
return
my
friends
by
the
time
we
reach
the
the
sun
will
be
near
setting
and
it
is
not
wise
to
pass
through
the
swamp
at
dusk
after
what
we
have
already
seen
of
its
inhabitants
said
the
doctor
laden
with
a
great
variety
of
specimens
we
made
our
way
to
the
boat
and
were
soon
rowing
across
the
lake
again
towards
the
swamp
the
breeze
had
died
away
so
that
our
sail
was
useless
and
we
had
to
pull
the
entire
distance
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
range
of
mountains
we
had
just
left
as
we
stopped
and
began
to
pack
up
our
boat
and
by
the
time
we
had
got
everything
inside
the
night
had
fallen
tired
and
hungry
we
were
glad
to
reach
our
home
again
and
as
soon
as
we
had
eaten
we
all
of
us
retired
to
rest
and
passed
a
peaceful
uneventful
night
if
the
monsters
of
the
swamp
were
noisy
we
did
not
hear
them
not
one
of
us
woke
until
the
sun
had
long
risen
after
breakfast
we
commenced
our
task
of
digging
out
the
from
the
mud
the
doctor
was
busy
preserving
specimens
dissecting
others
and
writing
his
scientific
journals
six
hours
hard
work
sufficed
to
get
the
clear
enough
to
start
we
also
took
the
precaution
of
putting
a
considerable
amount
of
ballast
into
our
to
replace
the
stores
which
had
been
consumed
so
that
we
should
not
again
experience
any
difficulty
in
descending
by
the
time
all
this
was
done
the
afternoon
was
well
advanced
yet
so
weary
of
the
swamp
were
we
that
we
decided
to
leave
it
at
once
we
can
not
do
better
than
make
for
the
beach
where
we
landed
this
morning
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
ascending
about
ten
thousand
feet
as
we
cross
that
will
enable
us
to
survey
a
good
many
miles
of
country
said
the
doctor
to
graham
slowly
we
soared
away
from
the
marsh
forest
high
over
the
reeds
up
into
the
pure
fresh
air
of
heaven
where
from
the
balcony
we
could
view
the
land
and
water
below
us
the
swamp
was
enormous
many
many
square
miles
in
extent
and
beyond
it
appeared
a
dense
forest
of
quite
a
different
kind
of
vegetation
the
country
as
far
as
we
could
see
from
the
base
of
the
mountains
to
the
shores
of
the
lake
and
beyond
it
was
much
the
same
throughout
its
area
as
that
which
we
had
already
explored
the
previous
day
certainly
none
of
it
bore
the
appearance
of
civilisation
all
seemed
virgin
wilderness
and
our
hearts
sank
within
us
beyond
the
belt
of
dark
forest
on
the
other
side
of
the
swamp
we
could
see
the
ocean
looking
landwards
the
highest
of
the
mountains
concealed
the
view
do
you
think
it
advisable
to
go
further
doctor
asked
graham
well
now
we
are
up
so
high
it
will
certainly
be
best
to
do
as
much
surveying
as
possible
and
then
we
can
discuss
our
position
and
future
movements
put
us
up
a
few
more
thousand
feet
graham
so
that
we
may
clear
these
mountains
and
see
what
the
country
is
like
beyond
them
the
scene
from
above
the
mountain
range
was
indescribably
beautiful
we
looked
down
upon
lofty
peaks
romantic
valleys
leaping
waterfalls
and
slumbering
lakes
upon
wild
and
lonely
plateaux
glaciers
and
upon
steep
cliffs
gentle
slopes
summits
and
others
like
unto
pyramids
pinnacles
or
spires
we
went
right
over
the
yawning
crater
and
looked
down
into
the
smoke
and
fire
which
rose
gently
from
its
hidden
depths
now
calm
and
peaceful
as
a
sleeping
child
we
saw
the
birthplace
of
rivers
high
up
the
hillsides
and
could
trace
them
from
their
source
to
the
distant
ocean
we
noticed
the
various
belts
of
vegetation
growing
on
the
mountain
slopes
from
the
lake
to
the
but
we
saw
no
trace
of
anything
shaped
and
fashioned
as
ourselves
higher
and
higher
we
rose
and
at
last
the
country
to
the
westward
or
behind
the
mountains
gradually
came
into
view
it
was
even
more
charmingly
beautiful
than
the
country
we
had
just
left
behind
us
more
level
more
wooded
better
watered
and
parts
of
it
apparently
under
cultivation
our
hearts
beat
fast
within
us
as
we
saw
what
looked
like
vast
enclosures
with
long
winding
canals
running
through
them
and
even
more
excited
still
did
we
become
when
we
distinctly
made
out
a
colossal
bridge
which
spanned
a
deep
valley
between
two
hills
there
there
are
the
signs
of
a
higher
intelligence
at
last
the
brute
creation
does
not
reign
supreme
as
we
feared
said
temple
bursting
into
tears
and
unable
to
control
his
feelings
longer
graham
waxed
eloquent
over
the
engineering
qualities
of
the
bridge
the
enormous
width
of
its
span
making
the
mightiest
bridges
of
earth
seem
but
as
toys
in
comparison
we
were
too
far
away
quite
thirty
miles
to
see
much
detail
but
we
could
distinguish
as
temple
spoke
two
vast
cities
one
on
either
hill
joined
together
by
the
bridge
with
palaces
and
halls
and
lofty
towers
apparently
of
white
marble
glistening
in
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
upon
seeing
this
wonderful
city
doctor
hermann
very
wisely
gave
the
word
to
descend
as
quickly
as
possible
in
case
we
might
be
observed
in
five
minutes
we
were
safe
on
the
ground
again
the
snugly
hidden
in
a
beautiful
grove
of
trees
and
underwood
on
the
banks
of
a
stream
in
a
spot
where
we
should
at
all
events
be
able
to
retreat
and
readily
conceal
ourselves
in
case
of
emergency
yes
temple
your
fears
were
all
unfounded
answered
the
doctor
mars
is
inhabited
by
reasoning
beings
i
assure
you
it
is
most
gratifying
to
find
the
speculations
of
my
early
days
of
study
and
the
conclusions
of
more
matured
years
of
experience
turning
out
to
be
absolute
facts
when
on
earth
i
used
to
dream
of
a
new
race
of
intellectual
beings
far
away
out
here
to
ponder
over
their
pursuits
and
their
appearance
to
wonder
if
they
were
more
highly
developed
physically
and
mentally
than
we
now
these
strangers
are
but
a
few
hours
walk
away
from
us
and
if
i
mistake
not
those
beings
that
made
and
dwell
in
that
fair
city
yonder
are
of
a
higher
development
even
than
ourselves
i
prophesy
their
intellect
is
greater
their
beauty
fairer
their
talents
more
numerous
their
civilization
more
advanced
or
not
so
much
decayed
as
our
own
we
will
seek
their
acquaintance
and
make
ourselves
known
unto
them
how
can
we
spend
the
hours
that
divide
us
from
then
but
darkness
is
settling
fast
around
us
and
we
must
wait
in
patience
the
coming
of
a
new
day
chapter
ix
the
morrow
and
what
came
of
it
never
did
four
human
beings
await
the
coming
of
daylight
with
such
feelings
as
ours
not
one
of
us
slept
for
a
moment
the
livelong
night
our
excitement
was
too
intense
and
the
result
of
our
doings
on
the
morrow
too
momentous
we
were
up
and
out
of
the
by
sunrise
looking
westwards
across
the
undulating
expanse
of
country
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
fair
city
we
saw
yesterday
but
vain
were
our
endeavours
a
group
of
low
hills
hid
all
from
view
on
a
hill
about
twenty
miles
to
the
north
of
where
we
stood
however
we
saw
three
mighty
domes
the
central
one
being
more
than
twice
the
size
of
the
others
from
the
way
in
which
they
glistened
in
the
sunlight
we
concluded
that
they
were
roofed
with
gold
or
some
metal
unknown
to
us
of
the
same
colour
and
brilliancy
a
large
wood
that
surrounded
them
hid
the
remainder
of
the
buildings
from
sight
but
their
size
appeared
to
be
enormous
dwarfing
all
earthly
structures
into
utter
insignificance
we
started
off
in
the
yet
early
morning
fully
armed
and
equipped
for
our
walk
across
country
to
the
distant
city
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
its
yet
unknown
inhabitants
that
they
were
beings
of
noble
stature
we
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
for
only
a
race
of
giants
could
have
reared
such
a
colossal
city
besides
the
very
physical
conditions
of
mars
point
to
the
existence
of
larger
types
of
life
than
any
now
prevailing
on
earth
we
had
not
walked
more
than
four
miles
on
our
way
before
we
reached
country
evidently
in
a
high
state
of
cultivation
we
passed
large
enclosures
of
red
grass
divided
by
hedges
of
a
plant
similar
to
the
one
we
noticed
growing
in
the
swamp
these
fields
were
evidently
crops
the
herbage
being
finer
and
longer
than
that
growing
wild
on
the
mountain
slopes
there
were
other
enclosures
full
of
a
creeping
plant
something
like
convolvulus
but
bearing
a
long
narrow
pod
full
of
small
seeds
and
in
others
were
bushes
laden
with
fruit
as
big
as
melons
and
very
similar
in
appearance
we
were
walking
steadily
along
a
broad
kind
of
pathway
between
these
enclosures
when
an
exclamation
from
sandy
caused
us
to
halt
and
immediately
confine
our
attention
to
something
which
the
cautious
scot
was
looking
at
on
the
ground
before
him
it
was
the
imprint
of
feet
in
the
soft
bare
ground
and
evidently
the
impressions
of
a
being
shod
with
moccasins
and
of
mighty
stature
as
we
were
all
stooping
down
intently
examining
the
first
absolute
traces
of
the
intellectual
inhabitants
of
mars
we
did
not
notice
the
approach
of
the
being
who
had
doubtless
left
these
tracks
behind
he
came
slowly
along
the
path
we
were
following
a
being
shall
we
say
a
human
being
for
in
all
his
outward
frame
he
resembled
ourselves
save
that
in
stature
he
was
a
giant
quite
nine
feet
in
height
his
features
were
almost
like
the
egyptians
of
old
and
his
skin
was
wonderfully
fair
and
beautiful
his
black
beard
swept
downwards
to
his
breast
and
his
long
bushy
hair
of
the
same
tint
was
confined
simply
by
a
ring
of
some
metal
which
just
encircled
the
crown
of
his
shapely
head
he
was
clothed
in
a
loosely
flowing
robe
of
some
soft
material
almost
like
silk
which
draped
from
his
neck
to
his
knees
girded
at
the
waist
with
a
broad
strap
from
which
dangled
several
curious
articles
of
which
we
knew
not
the
use
his
legs
and
feet
were
covered
with
the
skins
of
some
beast
curiously
ornamented
slowly
but
without
a
sign
of
fear
he
advanced
towards
us
carrying
in
his
hands
a
long
rod
made
of
some
metal
his
expression
was
warlike
we
had
evidently
to
deal
with
no
coward
but
we
could
plainly
see
that
his
curiosity
was
most
intense
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
the
doctor
all
of
us
were
visibly
alarmed
at
this
strange
bold
and
haughty
man
and
had
we
not
been
assured
by
the
calm
confidence
of
our
friend
we
should
most
certainly
have
felt
inclined
either
to
fight
our
visitor
at
once
or
make
the
best
of
our
way
out
of
his
presence
there
was
something
uncanny
about
him
had
he
even
spoken
the
awe
and
mystery
surrounding
him
would
not
have
been
so
terrible
but
he
came
towards
us
in
absolute
silence
and
when
about
a
dozen
paces
away
from
where
we
stood
he
paused
and
watched
us
intently
doctor
hermann
foolishly
we
thought
hailed
him
successively
in
german
in
english
and
in
latin
but
he
made
no
sound
in
reply
he
was
examining
us
minutely
evidently
full
of
confidence
in
the
superiority
of
his
size
and
strength
he
must
have
looked
upon
us
with
much
the
same
contemptuous
wonder
as
the
old
travellers
viewed
the
race
of
dwarfs
that
they
assure
us
inhabit
the
vast
forests
of
central
africa
sandy
at
last
hurled
at
him
a
perfect
torrent
of
honest
gaelic
which
only
seemed
to
rouse
his
anger
and
he
uttered
several
sounds
which
were
evidently
meant
for
words
of
warning
in
a
loud
imperious
but
not
unpleasant
voice
his
arm
was
raised
as
if
in
threat
towards
us
and
all
of
us
felt
thoroughly
alarmed
except
the
doctor
who
advanced
a
step
towards
him
with
both
hands
held
out
as
if
in
greeting
at
this
he
pointed
the
long
rod
he
was
carrying
towards
one
of
the
curious
animals
we
had
previously
met
with
near
the
lake
which
happened
to
be
grazing
quietly
away
and
within
a
second
of
time
we
saw
the
poor
creature
leap
into
the
air
and
drop
dead
we
heard
no
report
we
saw
no
flash
this
was
too
much
for
sandy
and
before
we
could
prevent
him
his
revolver
was
drawn
pointed
at
the
unknown
stranger
and
fired
once
twice
three
times
into
his
stalwart
body
at
the
first
shot
he
screamed
with
pain
and
tried
to
level
his
rod
at
us
at
the
second
he
fell
to
the
ground
the
result
of
the
third
we
never
learned
for
we
all
turned
and
fled
as
if
for
our
lives
towards
the
friendly
cover
which
sheltered
the
as
we
ran
behind
the
welcome
shelter
of
the
low
hills
we
noticed
several
more
of
these
strange
beings
hastening
from
various
directions
to
their
fallen
comrade
and
as
we
had
every
reason
to
dread
the
deadly
weapons
with
which
they
were
most
probably
armed
we
were
glad
to
reach
the
wooded
country
and
seek
our
refuge
under
the
cover
of
the
trees
with
thankful
hearts
we
reached
the
finding
everything
as
we
had
left
it
doctor
hermann
was
angry
beyond
all
measure
with
sandy
for
his
foolishness
in
shooting
without
just
provocation
and
threatened
that
if
he
did
not
keep
more
command
over
himself
in
future
he
should
not
carry
firearms
at
all
this
temple
is
a
most
unfortunate
occurrence
most
unfortunate
for
us
all
continued
the
doctor
after
he
had
finished
lecturing
sandy
who
was
now
all
contrition
and
cursing
himself
for
his
stupid
blunder
there
is
no
telling
what
may
happen
now
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
the
amount
of
misfortune
this
unwarranted
attack
on
a
harmless
being
may
bring
upon
us
it
is
folly
now
to
think
of
visiting
that
fair
city
yonder
on
foot
as
i
so
much
desired
i
quite
agree
with
you
doctor
yet
after
all
there
is
some
little
excuse
for
poor
sandy
matters
certainly
looked
threatening
my
own
hand
too
was
on
my
revolver
at
the
time
well
continued
temple
all
our
arguments
will
avail
us
nothing
now
regrets
are
useless
we
are
in
a
serious
position
like
all
englishmen
we
have
readily
got
ourselves
into
a
mess
and
let
us
hope
like
our
countrymen
we
shall
display
the
usual
quickness
of
resource
in
the
time
of
difficulty
and
danger
and
soon
see
a
way
out
of
it
true
true
my
dear
temple
remarked
the
doctor
regaining
his
usual
time
is
pressing
we
may
rest
assured
that
this
morning
work
is
well
noised
abroad
and
ere
long
there
will
be
a
hue
and
cry
after
us
although
my
remarks
may
savour
of
egotism
i
can
frankly
say
i
have
no
fear
of
any
living
being
on
this
planet
from
what
little
i
have
seen
of
its
civilisation
i
am
confident
that
we
shall
at
receive
justice
at
the
hands
of
its
inhabitants
if
a
labourer
of
the
field
for
such
i
take
this
martial
whom
we
have
slain
to
be
can
show
such
courage
and
be
possessed
of
a
weapon
that
makes
the
arms
of
earth
seem
but
as
the
toys
of
barbarians
in
comparison
if
i
say
the
lower
classes
of
this
planet
people
are
so
much
in
advance
of
ourselves
then
its
aristocracy
must
be
gifted
with
intelligence
far
higher
than
aught
we
wot
of
and
with
such
a
people
we
have
nought
to
fear
provided
we
can
make
them
understand
who
we
are
whence
we
came
and
what
is
our
mission
let
us
lose
no
time
in
getting
away
from
here
let
us
visit
the
city
yonder
in
the
boldly
and
with
brave
hearts
and
i
feel
sure
we
shall
be
received
in
a
manner
worthy
of
our
confidence
and
our
courage
doctor
i
am
afraid
your
naturally
brave
nature
makes
you
feel
too
sanguine
i
frankly
own
that
i
am
unable
to
acquiesce
with
all
you
say
still
i
can
not
suggest
anything
so
good
as
an
alternative
and
am
ready
to
act
on
your
suggestion
let
us
hope
all
may
yet
be
well
said
temple
we
could
start
off
elsewhere
said
graham
the
good
can
carry
us
to
some
other
part
of
this
martial
world
where
we
may
have
better
luck
with
the
natives
gently
graham
rejoined
the
doctor
you
overlook
the
fact
that
we
have
nearly
worn
out
our
machinery
everything
requires
a
thorough
overhaul
as
things
are
now
i
much
doubt
if
the
would
carry
us
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
i
ascertained
this
before
we
started
this
morning
as
an
engineer
i
ought
to
have
known
this
doctor
but
really
the
excitement
of
the
last
few
days
seems
to
have
knocked
everything
out
of
me
by
all
means
let
us
visit
the
city
with
what
little
electric
force
is
still
left
to
us
and
take
our
chance
answered
graham
and
his
remarks
were
seconded
by
temple
our
conversation
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
mighty
blast
from
what
we
judged
to
be
some
instrument
like
a
horn
it
sounded
so
near
that
we
each
sprang
up
to
look
fully
expecting
that
the
alarm
had
already
been
given
and
that
our
was
discovered
as
we
cautiously
peeped
between
the
trees
whilst
standing
on
the
balcony
of
the
we
beheld
dozens
of
this
mighty
race
of
people
searching
everywhere
about
the
countryside
and
another
blast
from
the
horn
which
sounded
much
nearer
than
the
previous
one
informed
us
that
some
at
least
of
our
pursuers
were
coming
in
our
direction
and
that
the
discovery
of
our
was
but
a
matter
of
a
very
short
time
the
climax
was
reached
a
few
minutes
afterwards
when
a
giant
of
herculean
strength
burst
through
the
low
underwood
and
with
a
curious
unearthly
shout
as
of
triumph
rushed
towards
the
perhaps
fortunately
for
us
he
carried
no
weapon
his
sole
equipment
seemed
to
be
a
mighty
horn
whose
bright
and
gleaming
coils
encircled
his
body
several
times
but
he
came
too
late
for
ere
he
could
get
within
twenty
paces
of
the
the
command
was
given
by
doctor
hermann
and
graham
set
the
engines
in
motion
we
shot
upwards
towards
the
sky
with
great
speed
and
before
our
astonished
pursuer
could
recover
from
his
surprise
we
were
a
thousand
feet
above
him
in
the
air
however
superior
to
us
in
their
intelligence
the
people
of
mars
might
be
they
were
evidently
nonplussed
at
our
escape
and
appeared
to
be
utterly
ignorant
of
aerial
navigation
in
any
form
whatever
at
least
we
thought
so
then
as
we
watched
them
gathering
into
groups
below
us
and
ever
and
anon
pointing
to
the
now
almost
at
rest
four
thousand
feet
above
them
doctor
how
i
wish
we
could
manage
to
well
clean
our
machinery
and
be
able
to
rely
upon
our
electricity
for
safety
this
is
beating
the
enemy
with
a
vengeance
said
graham
but
my
young
friend
you
forget
that
we
can
not
live
in
the
air
our
mission
is
to
make
friends
with
these
people
not
to
shun
them
to
fraternise
with
them
in
the
common
interests
of
humanity
now
that
we
are
here
a
serious
responsibility
rests
upon
each
and
all
of
us
the
teeming
millions
of
our
left
behind
on
earth
will
expect
us
to
make
the
very
most
of
our
glorious
opportunities
and
to
carry
back
to
them
a
full
history
of
the
wonders
of
this
new
world
and
new
race
must
be
our
watchword
until
our
work
is
done
even
though
our
lives
are
lost
in
the
effort
recall
the
words
you
uttered
graham
years
ago
on
that
fateful
evening
when
you
solemnly
pledged
yourself
to
this
mission
nay
even
devoted
your
life
to
its
full
accomplishment
our
course
is
clear
put
the
up
another
ten
thousand
feet
and
we
will
let
her
head
towards
the
beautiful
city
yonder
we
will
come
to
rest
on
that
elevation
above
it
and
then
be
guided
by
events
the
country
below
us
seemed
teeming
with
people
spreading
about
in
all
directions
and
dense
bodies
of
what
looked
like
troops
could
be
distinguished
coming
from
the
city
in
the
direction
of
the
place
where
the
had
rested
the
previous
night
evidently
these
people
had
some
very
rapid
means
of
communication
one
with
the
other
the
entire
district
appeared
to
be
thoroughly
aroused
and
the
commotion
was
evidently
increasing
each
moment
that
we
were
seen
was
manifest
thousands
of
upturned
faces
told
us
that
the
was
the
centre
of
attraction
and
every
movement
was
keenly
noted
we
had
now
a
much
better
view
of
the
three
glittering
domes
they
appeared
to
be
the
roof
of
some
magnificent
temple
whose
walls
seemed
of
white
marble
but
the
dense
growth
of
trees
round
the
entire
edifice
still
concealed
much
of
its
rare
beauty
from
our
gaze
just
as
we
came
over
the
outskirts
of
this
wonderful
town
the
received
a
terrible
blow
from
some
missile
which
made
her
quiver
from
top
to
bottom
and
we
quite
expected
that
we
were
about
to
fall
to
the
ground
had
the
projectile
struck
us
fairly
nothing
could
have
saved
us
but
by
good
fortune
it
glanced
obliquely
along
the
sides
of
the
and
spent
itself
in
space
if
i
mistake
not
that
has
been
fired
at
us
from
the
city
below
but
what
the
force
was
that
hurled
that
bullet
so
high
and
with
such
marvellously
accurate
aim
is
unknown
to
me
for
no
explosion
accompanied
it
said
the
doctor
with
rather
a
disconcerted
air
it
is
time
we
descended
of
our
own
free
will
doctor
answered
temple
otherwise
we
shall
be
brought
down
as
ignominiously
as
a
winged
hawk
and
there
will
then
be
a
speedy
end
to
us
and
our
projects
we
were
now
directly
over
the
city
and
such
a
noble
city
too
the
buildings
were
all
of
colossal
grandeur
the
streets
wide
and
at
right
angles
no
smaller
houses
mingled
with
the
rest
all
were
uniformly
grand
though
the
variety
of
the
architecture
prevented
the
slightest
monotony
there
were
several
magnificent
buildings
which
we
concluded
were
palaces
or
seats
of
government
on
the
larger
of
the
two
hills
on
which
the
city
rested
and
some
of
these
were
surrounded
by
gardens
the
top
of
each
hill
had
been
levelled
and
the
bridge
between
them
was
a
superb
structure
quite
half
a
mile
in
width
and
perhaps
three
miles
in
length
what
surprised
us
beyond
everything
was
the
total
absence
of
conveyances
or
of
any
kind
of
beasts
of
burthen
whatever
in
the
spacious
thoroughfares
which
were
crowded
with
people
alone
what
palaces
what
domes
what
halls
and
towers
what
streets
shouted
graham
carried
away
by
his
admiration
for
the
architects
and
engineers
who
had
planned
and
reared
them
after
earnest
consultation
we
decided
to
descend
at
once
choosing
a
vast
open
square
before
one
of
the
largest
edifices
but
which
appeared
to
be
deserted
of
people
as
the
exact
spot
slowly
we
dropped
through
the
air
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
ground
we
came
each
moment
the
magnificence
of
the
city
increasing
as
our
eager
scrutiny
became
closer
one
thousand
feet
more
five
hundred
one
hundred
only
left
not
a
living
creature
in
view
our
hearts
beat
fast
our
excitement
became
agony
in
its
intensity
the
courtyard
seemed
paved
with
precious
stones
of
every
hue
as
large
as
certainly
no
common
stones
of
earth
are
like
them
and
none
known
to
man
even
the
most
rare
so
large
curious
plants
and
trees
grew
in
beds
fountains
of
perfumed
water
shot
like
crystal
rockets
to
the
sky
all
this
and
more
we
noted
in
the
short
time
that
we
were
descending
the
last
few
feet
but
ere
the
could
touch
the
ground
a
thousand
stalwart
rushed
out
from
every
side
in
an
instant
we
were
the
centre
of
an
excited
frenzied
throng
and
our
lives
were
apparently
not
worth
another
moment
purchase
chapter
captivity
as
may
naturally
be
inferred
the
language
spoken
on
mars
is
totally
different
from
any
uttered
by
either
of
the
civilised
races
on
earth
we
of
course
were
ignorant
of
this
dialect
spoken
on
mars
and
were
unable
to
understand
what
was
said
to
us
at
the
time
of
our
capture
or
what
the
martials
were
saying
to
each
other
but
we
were
amazed
to
find
how
easily
their
language
could
be
acquired
and
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
we
were
able
to
converse
with
this
new
people
curiously
enough
on
the
other
hand
the
martials
found
great
difficulty
in
mastering
any
of
the
languages
of
earth
and
we
were
able
to
try
them
with
latin
with
greek
hebrew
german
french
gaelic
and
english
and
it
was
not
for
many
weeks
that
even
the
higher
classes
of
inhabitants
acquired
even
a
smattering
of
the
latter
tongue
for
several
moments
it
seemed
as
though
our
fate
was
sealed
as
the
gigantic
troopers
closed
round
the
with
fierce
and
angry
gestures
some
of
them
trying
to
climb
up
the
sides
and
reach
us
as
we
stood
in
fear
and
trembling
looking
down
upon
the
surging
throng
from
our
station
on
the
balcony
three
words
which
were
uttered
incessantly
by
the
crowd
of
soldiers
we
were
able
to
distinguish
from
all
the
rest
of
the
tumult
they
were
as
near
as
we
can
express
them
yan
ye
bo
which
being
translated
into
english
means
beings
from
the
sky
angry
shouts
of
emi
emi
tat
ya
mos
filled
the
air
and
these
words
we
afterwards
learned
signified
slay
slay
them
at
once
fortunately
for
us
our
situation
on
the
balcony
above
the
heads
of
the
soldiers
gave
us
a
momentary
respite
and
before
they
could
find
means
to
drag
us
from
our
refuge
a
martial
of
commanding
presence
forced
his
way
through
the
throng
scattering
the
troopers
to
the
right
and
left
and
with
loud
voice
uttered
the
word
etoba
several
times
this
was
evidently
a
command
for
the
soldiers
withdrew
several
yards
from
the
at
once
and
formed
a
cordon
round
us
silent
and
motionless
as
though
on
parade
all
through
this
trying
time
doctor
hermann
stood
on
the
balcony
of
the
with
hands
and
arms
outspread
endeavouring
to
inspire
the
martials
with
confidence
and
to
convince
them
of
our
peaceable
intentions
but
we
fear
his
supplications
and
his
signs
were
thrown
away

in
hand
temple
and
graham
stood
by
the
doctor
at
whose
urgent
entreaty
they
were
persuaded
to
put
up
their
firearms
and
face
the
situation
calmly
sandy
amidst
the
confusion
disappeared
into
the
as
we
thought
but
he
soon
returned
armed
with
a
mighty
sword
he
had
brought
with
him
concealed
in
the
unknown
to
us
and
with
which
he
assured
us
an
ancestor
of
his
had
fought
by
the
time
order
had
been
obtained
we
could
see
vast
numbers
of
people
crowding
up
to
the
square
from
all
directions
and
pressing
forward
to
the
lines
of
soldiers
eager
to
get
a
glimpse
of
what
was
taking
place
keen
as
was
our
anxiety
we
did
not
fail
to
notice
the
splendid
physique
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
wonderful
city
the
variety
in
their
dress
and
the
marvellous
beauty
of
the
female
martials
the
soldiers
were
clad
in
green
tunics
below
which
was
a
dress
reaching
to
just
above
the
knee
their
muscular
limbs
were
bare
but
their
feet
were
shod
in
high
laced
boots
and
each
was
armed
with
a
long
tube
of
brass
their
heads
were
encased
in
what
looked
to
be
massive
iron
helmets
we
had
not
time
to
notice
much
had
our
excitement
permitted
us
to
examine
these
things
in
detail
before
the
commandant
stepped
up
to
the
in
front
of
his
troops
and
bade
us
descend
and
yield
ourselves
into
his
custody
it
is
very
evident
that
we
are
about
to
be
taken
prisoners
said
the
doctor
we
had
best
submit
to
the
inevitable
without
any
show
of
resistance
force
will
only
incense
these
people
against
us
calmness
may
disarm
their
suspicions
and
ensure
us
kindly
perhaps
even
friendly
treatment
i
do
like
the
look
of
things
at
all
doctor
answered
temple
but
i
am
consoled
with
the
thought
that
we
have
escaped
from
perils
infinitely
more
terrible
than
this
we
will
stick
to
our
revolvers
if
we
can
said
graham
pocketing
his
bull
dog
as
he
spoke
i
for
one
am
not
going
to
be
slaughtered
in
cold
blood
without
a
fight
for
it
i
see
no
objection
to
our
keeping
these
arms
by
us
in
case
of
direst
need
but
my
last
advice
is
to
keep
calm
to
keep
calm
answered
the
doctor
with
great
emphasis
on
the
latter
word
further
conversation
was
impossible
as
the
officer
who
had
bidden
us
come
forth
was
beginning
to
show
signs
of
impatience
at
our
delay
beings
from
the
sky
i
kaosp
captain
of
the
king
troops
in
the
city
of
edos
command
your
immediate
surrender
to
me
so
that
you
may
explain
yourselves
to
his
majesty
rulers
and
inform
them
from
whence
ye
came
and
your
business
here
delay
or
resistance
will
be
visited
with
instant
death
this
seemed
language
of
dreadful
import
to
us
and
without
understanding
a
syllable
of
it
we
dropped
the
ladder
from
the
door
and
headed
by
the
doctor
climbed
slowly
down
to
the
ground
the
eye
of
every
martial
standing
within
view
being
fixed
upon
us
with
the
keenest
attention
three
at
least
of
our
little
party
looked
like
dwarfs
as
we
stood
before
the
hercules
who
had
bidden
us
surrender
ourselves
to
him
but
graham
suffered
little
by
comparison
with
this
giant
erect
and
defiant
he
stood
before
his
captor
inch
for
inch
almost
as
tall
as
him
broad
and
in
proportion
his
muscular
arms
folded
across
his
massive
chest
his
clear
grey
eyes
scanning
him
curiously
from
head
to
foot
we
could
see
that
graham
had
created
a
favourable
impression
and
for
that
we
were
thankful
we
stood
in
line
before
the
poor
old
and
awaited
the
next
move
in
this
singular
scene
in
a
few
moments
the
commander
kaosp
we
will
call
him
for
the
future
addressed
some
words
to
his
troops
and
then
a
dozen
warriors
stepped
out
from
the
ranks
and
formed
an
escort
round
us
a
dozen
more
surrounded
the
kaosp
then
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
his
soldiers
and
gave
the
word
to
march
surrounded
by
the
troops
we
wended
our
way
towards
the
noble
palace
across
the
square
the
lines
of
soldiers
opening
and
making
a
passage
for
us
as
we
advanced
we
passed
under
a
lofty
archway
went
up
a
flight
of
steps
and
then
entered
a
magnificent
hall
with
a
domed
roof
here
all
the
guards
remained
behind
save
two
and
they
and
their
leader
escorted
us
across
the
marble
floor
to
another
archway
which
led
into
a
smaller
hall
crossing
this
we
reached
a
door
which
opened
automatically
as
we
approached
and
after
going
up
a
flight
of
steps
we
reached
a
wide
corridor
along
this
we
walked
until
we
came
to
another
door
which
opened
in
the
same
mysterious
manner
and
we
were
ushered
into
a
large
apartment
the
door
closing
behind
us
at
once
and
we
were
left
to
ourselves
beggin
your
pardon
doctor
but
this
is
what
i
call
a
shabby
way
to
receive
such
distinguished
visitors
as
the
likes
o
we
just
to
be
popped
in
here
like
snared
birds
in
a
cage
after
comin
all
this
way
too
bother
tak
sich
hospitality
says
sandy
we
were
too
much
absorbed
in
thinking
over
our
future
to
take
any
heed
of
sandy
remarks
and
before
we
had
time
to
form
any
definite
plans
the
door
of
our
prison
was
thrown
open
and
kaosp
appeared
with
two
guards
and
beckoned
us
to
accompany
them
once
more
my
friends
let
me
implore
you
to
keep
cool
the
doctor
hurriedly
whispered
as
we
were
marched
away
we
were
conducted
along
vast
corridors
and
through
many
doorways
before
we
reached
the
entrance
of
a
magnificent
hall
where
evidently
the
king
and
his
ministers
were
assembled
in
state
awaiting
our
arrival
the
splendours
of
this
building
are
beyond
the
power
of
any
description
so
suddenly
did
we
find
ourselves
surrounded
by
the
glitter
and
pomp
of
this
brilliant
gathering
that
for
several
moments
we
stood
still
in
utter
amazement
bewildered
lost
in
the
glorious
scene
before
us
we
heard
as
in
a
dream
the
blast
of
what
seemed
a
thousand
trumpets
heralding
our
approach
and
as
in
a
dream
were
conducted
to
a
small
raised
platform
in
the
very
centre
of
the
vast
assembly
directly
facing
the
king
and
his
court
the
hall
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
male
and
female
martials
perhaps
we
ought
to
call
them
men
and
women
a
sea
of
eager
faces
greeting
our
appearance
but
the
expressions
upon
those
we
looked
at
closely
seemed
by
no
means
friendly
disposed
towards
us
a
hum
of
intense
yet
suppressed
excitement
broke
from
the
assembled
throng
as
we
stepped
upon
the
dais
in
full
view
of
all
the
day
was
rapidly
drawing
to
a
close
the
gloom
of
coming
night
beginning
to
settle
on
that
vast
gathering
as
the
doctor
and
his
companions
in
captivity
calmly
stood
the
observed
of
all
observers
awaiting
their
fate
the
half
light
seemed
to
increase
the
magnificence
of
the
spacious
building
by
toning
down
its
brilliancy
and
harmonising
the
wealth
of
rare
colour
that
everywhere
delighted
the
eye
the
entire
dome
was
covered
with
a
painting
of
some
mighty
conflict
the
panels
of
the
walls
were
filled
with
others
so
so
realistic
that
we
blushed
for
very
shame
as
we
compared
in
our
mind
eye
these
works
of
art
with
the
masterpieces
of
earthly
painters
noble
groups
of
statuary
carved
out
of
lustrous
stones
of
a
tint
filled
us
with
admiration
urns
and
vases
and
ornaments
of
wood
and
metal
were
arranged
with
a
keen
eye
for
effect
on
every
side
whilst
the
windows
of
coloured
glass
if
glass
it
was
were
superb
both
in
their
wonderful
design
and
harmony
of
colour
garlands
of
foliage
the
leaves
of
fine
gold
twined
round
the
marble
pillars
bearing
clusters
of
sparkling
jewels
designed
as
fruits
whilst
before
the
throne
was
a
fountain
of
cunning
workmanship
which
cast
up
from
unseen
sources
jets
of
scented
water
that
not
only
filled
the
building
with
a
subtle
ravishing
perfume
but
kept
the
atmosphere
cool
and
refreshing
the
audience
which
filled
this
hall
of
splendour
was
evidently
a
mixed
one
what
we
took
to
be
those
of
high
degree
surrounded
the
king
and
his
ministers
round
them
were
the
guards
and
minor
officers
whilst
beyond
them
again
was
the
populace
the
floor
rose
gradually
from
the
centre
so
that
every
person
could
see
and
hear
all
that
took
place
the
king
and
his
courtiers
were
one
blaze
of
glittering
jewels
and
gorgeous
colour
their
robes
and
vestments
being
rare
and
costly
to
a
degree
undreamed
of
on
earth
even
by
the
wildest
fancy
of
man
as
in
our
own
world
almost
every
type
of
countenance
was
to
be
observed
among
this
vast
assemblage
yet
we
could
not
help
remarking
that
the
men
of
mars
were
handsomer
as
a
race
than
the
men
of
earth
and
that
the
women
of
mars
were
more
beautiful
the
old
king
himself
was
a
grand
specimen
of
manhood
his
lofty
brow
clearly
cut
features
long
flowing
white
beard
and
commanding
dignified
presence
made
him
every
inch
a
king
he
was
surrounded
with
a
host
of
noble
councillors
almost
as
as
himself
the
younger
men
were
handsome
stalwart
fellows
broad
of
chest
and
lithe
of
limb
moustached
and
bearded
sons
of
a
race
evidently
at
the
zenith
of
its
development
both
mentally
and
physically
our
hearts
warmed
towards
them
in
honest
admiration
we
felt
that
we
were
in
the
presence
of
our
superiors
the
females
at
this
gathering
were
remarkable
for
their
exceeding
beauty
edos
must
be
a
city
of
fair
women
if
those
assembled
here
around
us
were
an
average
specimen
of
its
lady
inhabitants
the
classic
regularity
of
their
features
was
superb
their
wonderful
wealth
of
hair
their
marvellously
clear
complexion
the
rare
symmetry
of
their
form
the
expression
of
their
beautiful
eyes
their
commanding
presence
all
combined
in
making
them
attractive
to
a
degree
undreamed
of
by
dwellers
on
earth
in
all
that
peerless
galaxy
of
beauty
one
magnificent
creature
with
large
expressive
eyes
and
hair
of
gold
seated
close
to
the
king
himself
was
fairer
far
than
all
the
rest
her
face
and
figure
were
sublime
she
sat
with
queenly
dignity
with
a
coronet
aflame
with
jewels
upon
her
lovely
brow
gazing
intently
upon
us
stirred
to
the
very
depths
of
her
soul
with
wondering
curiosity
and
from
time
to
time
talking
with
the
aged
king
the
theme
of
her
conversation
evidently
being
us
poor
captives
friendless
and
helpless
in
the
centre
of
that
gazing
throng
she
was
dressed
in
a
robe
of
delicate
purple
hue
which
though
draped
but
loosely
round
her
still
displayed
in
suggestive
grace
the
beauty
of
her
hidden
form
her
hair
fell
in
rippling
golden
tresses
far
below
her
waist
her
arms
looking
white
as
marble
in
the
deepening
twilight
were
bare
to
the
shoulder
she
sat
or
rather
reclined
on
a
pile
of
softest
skins
and
her
feet
rested
upon
a
mat
of
similar
material
we
noticed
all
that
we
have
here
described
within
a
very
few
seconds
from
the
time
that
we
stepped
upon
the
dais
then
suddenly
the
vast
hall
was
filled
with
brilliant
artificial
light
an
electric
light
as
far
as
we
could
judge
although
the
source
of
its
supply
was
cunningly
concealed
the
effect
was
magical
the
flashing
gems
and
brilliant
metals
the
statuary
the
polished
pillars
walls
and
floors
the
sparkling
scented
water
the
royal
troops
the
eager
throng
formed
a
scene
of
unparalleled
magnificence
and
splendour
as
soon
as
the
hall
was
illuminated
as
by
the
light
of
day
the
proceedings
began
an
aged
statesman
amidst
breathless
silence
rose
up
from
his
seat
crossed
the
floor
and
stood
opposite
to
where
the
king
sat
in
solemn
state
making
a
low
and
reverent
obeisance
he
began
to
tell
the
story
of
our
appearance
near
their
city
how
we
were
met
by
the
martial
whose
life
we
took
how
we
took
refuge
in
the
and
after
the
alarm
had
been
given
how
a
search
was
made
and
our
discovered
then
he
described
our
evading
further
pursuit
by
soaring
up
into
the
air
in
our
curious
carriage
how
we
travelled
over
the
city
of
edos
and
were
fired
at
by
the
soldiers
how
we
eventually
came
slowly
down
to
the
ground
again
to
the
square
near
the
palace
and
how
we
had
been
surrounded
and
taken
prisoners
by
his
majesty
troops
at
last
this
address
appeared
to
make
a
profound
impression
upon
the
multitude
and
so
far
as
we
could
judge
the
wrath
of
the
people
was
exceedingly
great
the
odds
were
evidently
against
us
and
each
one
of
us
felt
although
at
the
time
we
did
not
understand
a
word
of
what
was
being
said
that
our
position
was
momentarily
becoming
more
serious
for
several
minutes
after
this
harangue
was
finished
the
silence
was
profound
every
eye
was
turned
towards
us
the
old
king
face
was
grave
and
stern
and
troubled
then
as
if
to
make
matters
worse
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
loud
commotion
at
one
of
the
entrances
to
the
hall
and
the
next
moment
poor
old
rover
broke
through
the
ring
of
guards
and
officers
and
leaping
and
barking
for
joy
hastened
to
sandy
side
at
first
the
direst
alarm
prevailed
and
we
noticed
the
lovely
woman
by
the
king
side
clutch
his
arm
in
terror
for
of
course
our
dog
was
even
a
stranger
animal
to
the
company
here
assembled
than
we
were
ourselves
at
a
word
from
sandy
he
lay
down
between
us
and
curiously
enough
there
he
was
suffered
to
remain
he
had
broken
out
of
the
where
in
the
excitement
of
our
departure
we
had
left
and
forgotten
him
and
made
his
way
unerringly
to
his
master
side
our
only
friend
we
afterwards
learned
that
the
most
serious
part
of
our
case
was
the
slaying
of
the
martial
and
as
the
old
minister
told
this
part
of
his
story
one
of
the
guards
advanced
and
pointed
with
his
brass
tube
to
sandy
indicating
that
he
was
the
actual
culprit
a
long
and
animated
discussion
took
place
in
which
the
king
occasionally
joined
or
was
appealed
to
for
his
advice
then
a
long
interval
of
silence
followed
in
which
the
king
was
evidently
considering
the
facts
which
had
been
laid
before
him
our
hearts
beat
fast
each
one
right
hand
clasped
the
revolver
concealed
within
his
breast
for
each
had
mentally
determined
to
fight
for
life
unto
the
bitter
end
courage
whispered
hermann
and
for
the
love
of
heaven
do
not
fire
until
i
give
the
signal
i
am
going
to
try
and
make
these
people
understand
a
little
of
our
history
a
moment
after
the
doctor
advanced
a
few
steps
towards
the
king
bowing
low
and
with
hands
extended
as
if
in
welcome
the
king
watched
him
curiously
and
so
did
we
for
we
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
his
intentions
were
he
then
pointed
to
the
open
entrance
up
into
the
night
sky
where
the
planet
earth
by
some
miraculous
good
fortune
chanced
to
be
shining
with
unusual
splendour
almost
alone
in
the
firmament
then
by
various
signs
he
attempted
to
explain
how
we
had
come
from
that
particular
star
that
we
were
friends
and
were
anxious
to
gain
their
good
will
we
afterwards
learned
that
the
king
had
comprehended
much
of
what
the
doctor
had
sought
to
convey
but
prejudice
ran
high
and
though
personally
inclined
to
befriend
us
he
was
biassed
by
his
ministers
the
doctor
rejoined
us
once
more
and
almost
directly
afterwards
the
king
began
to
speak
as
one
man
the
mighty
throng
saluted
him
and
bowed
in
reverence
then
the
multitude
all
standing
listening
intently
to
his
words
which
were
as
follows
beloved
subjects
and
children
a
great
event
hath
happened
amongst
us
such
as
hath
never
been
known
to
you
my
people
throughout
the
long
and
glorious
history
of
our
race
five
strange
beings
have
made
their
appearance
amongst
us
from
whence
they
come
we
know
not
who
they
are
or
what
their
object
is
in
coming
here
are
also
mysteries
which
we
can
not
readily
solve
by
shedding
the
blood
of
our
poor
brother
yesterday
we
fear
these
beings
are
of
evil
repute
and
therefore
should
be
treated
as
enemies
of
our
race
and
die
their
leader
by
sundry
signs
hath
sought
to
tell
us
that
they
come
from
the
ramos
which
they
call
if
this
were
true
and
their
hands
were
not
stained
in
blood
we
would
welcome
them
as
brothers
for
our
wise
men
have
long
suspected
that
beings
fashioned
like
ourselves
do
dwell
thereon
wisdom
cometh
slowly
and
knowledge
is
gained
by
degrees
we
will
wait
and
see
my
people
if
these
strangers
can
prove
that
what
they
say
by
signs
is
true
we
of
this
world
do
nothing
hurriedly
nor
do
we
take
life
without
just
cause
we
know
not
these
tongues
nor
they
ours
justice
bids
us
wait
forty
days
of
grace
will
we
allow
them
then
here
in
this
our
hall
of
justice
shall
they
take
their
trial
and
their
fate
be
decided
we
have
spoken
these
words
with
such
wisdom
as
god
hath
given
us
and
may
he
still
continue
to
preserve
my
people
from
all
harm
amidst
shouts
of
approval
the
king
ceased
speaking
and
as
we
understood
not
a
word
of
what
he
had
said
we
concluded
that
our
doom
was
decided
in
all
that
mighty
throng
we
had
not
one
to
befriend
us
each
face
was
stern
and
of
forbidding
aspect
yet
stay
there
was
one
whose
eyes
were
even
wet
with
tears
at
our
misfortune
and
whose
shy
pitying
glances
steeled
our
nerves
anew
the
lady
by
the
king
side
breathed
hope
in
her
glances
her
lovely
eyes
were
dimmed
with
tears
for
us
and
we
felt
as
men
once
more
love
power
was
working
by
what
attractive
force
was
the
latent
spark
of
compassion
ignited
in
that
fair
martial
breast
she
alone
of
all
that
multitude
was
drawn
towards
us
by
a
bond
of
sympathy
who
knows
but
that
all
unconsciously
her
spirit
and
ours
may
have
mingled
in
that
silent
world
of
shadows
where
language
race
or
creed
form
no
barrier
to
friendly
intercourse
and
where
the
inconveniences
of
space
as
we
experience
them
in
our
mortal
shapes
are
unknown
who
after
this
shall
say
that
lives
may
not
be
governed
and
influenced
by
beings
on
other
worlds
in
other
spheres
just
as
the
attraction
of
one
planet
can
sway
another
from
its
course
across
the
sky
by
some
subtle
influence
we
felt
reassured
all
thoughts
of
fighting
for
our
lives
departed
and
when
kaosp
and
his
guards
stepped
forward
we
followed
them
even
cheerfully
back
to
our
prison
rover
being
allowed
to
trot
behind
at
our
heels
chapter
xi
love
and
jealousy
once
more
we
were
ushered
into
the
large
and
lofty
room
which
was
to
be
our
prison
house
our
guards
withdrew
the
massive
door
swung
back
moved
by
hidden
automatic
action
and
we
were
left
to
our
own
sad
reflections
oh
for
the
good
with
everything
in
order
sighed
graham
we
would
soon
show
these
martial
hosts
that
we
are
not
the
poor
weak
fools
they
take
us
to
be
tut
tut
graham
said
the
doctor
cheerily
the
game
seems
against
us
now
but
we
may
hold
the
trump
cards
yet
man
besides
you
have
evidently
made
a
conquest
he
continued
with
sly
humour
and
that
fair
martial
maiden
may
yet
prove
a
guardian
angel
ah
doctor
sanguine
as
ever
what
a
hopeful
old
boy
you
are
but
i
for
one
seem
to
think
we
are
in
a
deuce
of
a
hole
this
time
said
temple
with
just
a
tinge
of
irritation
in
his
voice
i
do
see
the
least
call
for
any
such
joke
at
my
expense
doctor
said
graham
smilingly
but
there
it
is
best
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
things
ah
now
i
was
right
after
all
graham
the
fair
lady
who
seems
so
grieved
about
us
little
dreams
that
she
has
made
a
conquest
too
doctor
i
feel
peckish
mysel
and
i
ken
puir
old
rover
misses
his
supper
surely
they
dinna
mean
starvin
o
us
all
in
good
time
sandy
all
in
good
time
here
a
biscuit
for
rover
i
happened
to
put
in
my
pocket
this
morning
remarked
the
doctor
well
temple
he
continued
we
have
evidently
been
respited
for
some
reason
or
other
that
looks
as
though
these
strange
people
were
not
altogether
unfriendly
disposed
towards
us
we
must
make
a
lot
of
allowance
for
them
after
all
think
what
a
fuss
five
beings
from
mars
would
make
were
they
to
drop
from
the
sky
into
trafalgar
square
or
palace
yard
some
fine
day
and
that
mind
you
after
killing
in
cold
blood
an
innocent
at
ealing
or
hendon
why
all
london
would
be
wild
with
excitement
and
a
righteously
incensed
populace
would
be
clamouring
for
their
immediate
trial
and
execution
the
evening
papers
especially
we
take
these
inoffensive
people
by
surprise
and
really
we
are
fortunate
in
having
been
able
so
far
to
conciliate
them
as
to
gain
time
and
that
is
all
we
want
we
shall
be
but
the
doctor
was
interrupted
by
the
door
swinging
open
and
kaosp
making
his
appearance
once
more
accompanied
by
the
two
attendant
guards
and
five
servants
bearing
dishes
these
dishes
were
of
the
costliest
description
evidently
of
fine
gold
beautifully
chased
with
leaves
and
flowers
the
like
of
which
we
had
never
seen
before
each
servant
bore
his
dish
in
silent
state
and
placed
it
upon
the
inlaid
marble
table
then
bowing
low
withdrew
the
guards
stationed
themselves
one
on
either
side
of
the
doorway
and
then
kaosp
advanced
and
in
his
unknown
tongue
assisted
by
signs
conveyed
to
us
the
fact
that
it
was
by
the
king
desire
that
this
food
was
brought
and
that
we
were
to
sit
down
and
eat
we
began
to
look
on
kaosp
almost
as
a
friend
he
seemed
equally
to
be
kindly
disposed
towards
us
for
he
smiled
and
smote
his
breast
evidently
a
salute
as
he
and
his
guards
departed
come
come
said
the
doctor
this
is
not
so
bad
after
all
we
must
try
and
pick
up
their
language
and
then
i
have
no
doubt
by
being
able
to
explain
ourselves
we
shall
be
safe
with
these
people
now
sandy
uncover
our
dishes
and
let
us
see
on
what
strange
food
we
are
expected
to
fare
do
doctor
be
serious
remarked
temple
what
are
you
going
to
do
why
eat
of
course
man
since
these
captors
of
ours
have
condescended
to
supply
us
with
the
wherewithal
to
do
so
i
must
confess
in
spite
of
our
bad
luck
i
begin
to
feel
uncommonly
hungry
said
the
doctor
it
was
all
no
good
however
temple
seemed
thoroughly
cast
down
and
all
that
we
could
do
or
say
failed
to
arouse
him
from
his
despondent
mood
sandy
was
soon
at
work
and
we
found
that
under
each
larger
cover
was
a
dish
divided
into
compartments
in
which
a
variety
of
food
was
placed
we
had
flesh
of
various
kinds
a
liquor
like
clear
soup
fruits
and
square
tablets
of
what
appeared
to
be
bread
yet
very
fruity
to
the
taste
the
large
vessel
contained
pure
water
and
round
the
lower
rim
were
hung
several
smaller
vases
which
were
evidently
to
be
used
as
two
curious
instruments
were
attached
to
each
dish
which
took
us
some
time
to
comprehend
their
use
the
larger
was
fashioned
something
like
a
spoon
fastened
in
a
carved
wooden
handle
yet
one
edge
was
sharp
and
it
was
ultimately
discovered
that
this
served
the
purpose
of
knife
and
spoon
in
one
the
other
a
piece
of
gold
also
set
in
a
handle
of
carved
wood
we
took
to
be
a
fork
and
used
it
as
such
we
found
the
flesh
and
one
of
the
dishes
of
green
vegetables
excellent
but
the
fruit
and
what
we
must
call
bread
was
not
very
palatable
to
us
i
doubt
not
that
if
we
live
here
long
remarked
graham
we
shall
acquire
a
taste
for
the
other
viands
we
ca
expect
to
find
everything
suited
to
the
tastes
and
customs
of
the
men
of
earth
that
true
graham
said
temple
who
was
fast
recovering
his
spirits
and
beginning
to
take
a
more
cheerful
view
of
our
situation
it
astonishing
what
a
difference
a
little
food
makes
in
a
hungry
even
in
a
despondent
man
our
meal
was
quickly
finished
sandy
taking
good
care
that
rover
had
a
plentiful
portion
of
the
feast
then
graham
produced
his
case
and
each
one
of
us
enjoyed
the
precious
luxury
of
a
really
good
cigar
a
bock
of
the
choicest
quality
make
the
most
of
them
my
comrades
said
graham
striking
a
wax
taper
on
the
end
of
his
silver
i
have
but
a
dozen
and
heaven
knows
when
we
may
get
more
there
a
score
boxes
left
at
least
in
the
but
i
suppose
they
are
lost
to
us
for
ever
in
the
middle
of
our
smoke
kaosp
appeared
with
his
guards
and
great
was
his
and
their
amazement
to
see
us
smoking
this
is
evidently
an
art
unknown
to
the
people
of
mars
tobacco
apparently
being
a
plant
with
which
earth
alone
is
blessed
by
some
curious
action
of
his
a
door
in
our
prison
opened
and
revealed
to
us
another
chamber
fitted
up
with
luxuriant
couches
soft
as
on
which
by
signs
the
friendly
soldier
informed
us
we
might
stretch
our
weary
limbs
in
sleep
we
passed
into
this
ante
room
and
with
friendly
salute
kaosp
withdrew
and
the
door
immediately
closed
behind
him
it
is
almost
needless
to
say
that
we
passed
a
fairly
comfortable
night
yet
we
deemed
it
wisest
to
keep
watch
by
turns
in
case
of
surprise
the
martial
moons
shone
down
through
the
windows
of
our
prison
with
great
brightness
two
of
them
being
visible
together
and
the
planet
earth
now
much
lower
on
the
horizon
than
when
we
were
in
the
hall
of
justice
looked
like
venus
as
we
often
see
her
when
fairly
placed
in
the
sky
of
our
own
world
at
home
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
chronicle
all
the
monotony
of
our
confinement
one
day
passed
much
as
another
so
far
as
eating
drinking
and
sleeping
were
concerned
we
saw
a
great
deal
of
the
commander
kaosp
and
from
him
we
began
to
learn
the
martial
tongue
the
doctor
possessed
a
marvellous
aptitude
for
acquiring
any
new
tongue
on
earth
and
this
served
him
in
good
stead
on
the
planet
mars
after
a
week
intercourse
with
kaosp
he
was
able
to
converse
in
a
broken
sort
of
way
in
three
weeks
he
had
mastered
sufficient
for
all
ordinary
purposes
temple
found
it
more
difficult
sandy
only
picked
up
a
few
words
and
phrases
from
his
master
but
graham
proved
himself
an
apt
pupil
and
was
almost
as
good
a
conversationist
as
the
doctor
in
even
less
time
from
kaosp
we
learned
much
he
was
the
only
one
who
acted
as
our
jailor
we
learned
that
the
king
had
commanded
him
to
teach
us
their
language
so
that
we
might
be
prepared
to
explain
ourselves
and
our
mission
to
him
and
his
ministers
at
the
trial
which
he
assured
us
was
to
take
place
in
forty
days
from
the
time
of
our
capture
we
also
learned
that
the
beautiful
being
who
sat
near
the
king
in
the
hall
of
justice
was
his
own
daughter
that
her
name
was
volinè
that
she
was
her
father
idol
and
his
people
pride
many
startling
facts
did
kaosp
tell
us
concerning
his
race
how
their
span
of
life
averaged
five
hundred
years
which
as
the
year
of
mars
is
twice
the
length
of
earth
would
be
a
thousand
years
of
our
time
how
war
was
unknown
amongst
them
one
king
and
one
government
ruling
all
civilized
beings
how
some
parts
of
mars
were
inhabited
by
savage
tribes
and
beasts
how
their
armies
were
kept
up
for
protection
against
these
uncivilized
races
and
for
court
pageantry
and
also
how
one
universal
language
prevailed
he
also
told
us
among
other
things
that
this
stranger
world
was
but
thinly
peopled
its
inhabitants
increasing
very
slowly
the
results
of
a
marriage
rarely
producing
more
than
two
or
three
offspring
that
one
of
the
most
terrible
scourges
which
troubled
the
martial
world
was
the
almost
universal
loss
of
memory
that
broke
out
like
a
plague
from
time
to
time
and
that
owing
to
this
the
people
were
exceedingly
careful
in
keeping
records
of
their
pursuits
history
and
progress
from
what
we
learned
from
kaosp
respecting
our
preliminary
examination
in
the
hall
of
justice
we
concluded
that
when
our
trial
did
take
place
we
should
be
able
to
vindicate
ourselves
and
make
friends
with
these
people
so
that
we
looked
forward
to
the
event
with
eager
interest
being
most
anxious
to
regain
our
liberty
and
explore
this
strange
world
to
our
hearts
desire
we
also
learned
from
kaosp
that
volinè
the
king
daughter
had
taken
a
great
interest
in
us
and
had
deigned
to
make
numerous
enquiries
about
us
from
him
he
being
granted
an
audience
each
day
to
inform
her
of
whatever
portion
of
our
history
he
had
been
able
to
learn
the
king
himself
was
also
eager
to
know
how
his
captives
fared
but
never
once
did
he
come
to
see
us
in
person
on
the
tenth
morning
of
our
imprisonment
kaosp
brought
startling
news
nothing
less
than
that
volinè
volinè
the
king
proud
beautiful
daughter
was
coming
to
visit
us
in
our
prison
some
time
during
the
day
he
told
us
how
she
had
besought
him
to
let
her
see
us
how
he
had
tried
to
dissuade
her
and
how
ultimately
she
had
commanded
him
to
take
her
and
that
he
had
not
dared
to
disobey
her
wish
we
were
all
full
of
expectant
curiosity
attendants
came
and
prepared
our
large
room
for
the
unusual
visit
and
sandy
pocket
his
inseparable
companion
even
in
captivity
was
in
great
requisition
by
us
all
for
each
of
us
felt
it
incumbent
to
make
himself
as
presentable
as
possible
to
our
fair
and
distinguished
visitor
illustration
volinè
she
came
the
day
was
nearly
spent
the
sun
in
a
sea
of
yellow
radiance
was
just
about
to
sink
behind
the
hills
as
our
prison
doors
were
thrown
open
and
kaosp
saluting
respectfully
with
helmet
in
hand
ushered
volinè
and
her
attendant
maidens
into
our
presence
we
have
already
alluded
to
her
marvellous
beauty
as
we
saw
her
reclining
by
her
father
but
far
more
did
her
charms
impress
us
now
as
she
swept
with
all
queenly
grace
into
our
apartment
with
head
held
high
and
flowing
golden
tresses
mantling
over
her
glorious
bust
and
shoulders
and
falling
in
silky
coils
below
her
waist
her
outer
dress
was
polished
black
a
robe
girdled
at
the
waist
and
which
clung
in
ravishing
folds
to
her
stately
form
a
diadem
of
glittering
purple
stones
like
diamonds
encircled
her
brow
and
her
robe
was
fastened
across
her
left
shoulder
by
a
jewelled
buckle
of
fabulous
richness
though
of
such
commanding
stature
she
was
grace
itself
not
a
part
of
her
magnificent
figure
out
of
proportion
with
the
rest
a
woman
yet
a
goddess
too
beauty
personified
her
lovely
violet
eyes
gave
an
incomparable
expression
of
saintly
beauty
to
her
countenance
and
yet
there
was
nothing
meek
or
humble
there
fire
and
passion
and
unbending
will
lurked
deep
down
in
their
purple
dreamy
depths
no
being
in
female
form
whether
human
or
divine
could
have
appeared
more
lovely
as
volinè
stood
surrounded
by
the
subdued
golden
glory
of
the
setting
sun
which
poured
in
at
the
window
and
threw
a
halo
round
her
a
murmur
of
admiration
involuntarily
burst
from
each
one
of
us
as
we
stood
in
rapt
astonishment
gazing
upon
the
fair
being
before
us
then
we
each
bowed
low
and
respectfully
as
she
sank
into
the
pillowed
seat
which
had
been
provided
for
her
in
truth
it
was
an
impressive
scene
two
martial
maidens
stood
on
either
side
carrying
little
golden
vessels
suspended
by
chains
of
the
same
metal
and
containing
a
subtle
perfume
which
soon
pervaded
our
chamber
with
its
sweetness
two
other
maidens
bore
long
tapering
white
wands
in
their
left
hands
in
their
right
hands
they
had
bouquets
of
rare
and
curious
flowers
strangers
she
commenced
in
a
voice
that
was
singularly
sweet
and
musical
for
your
names
i
know
not
i
volinè
daughter
of
the
king
give
you
greeting
i
have
bidden
our
trusty
soldier
kaosp
conduct
me
hither
so
that
mine
eyes
may
see
that
it
is
still
well
with
ye
for
i
feel
an
interest
in
your
fate
my
ears
are
open
to
any
complaint
which
perchance
ye
may
wish
to
make
concerning
your
treatment
in
this
our
palace
since
my
royal
father
and
his
councillors
in
their
great
wisdom
commanded
that
ye
be
held
prisoners
here
we
dwellers
in
the
city
edos
are
not
wanting
in
hospitality
to
the
stranger
but
ye
are
not
our
people
not
of
our
world
we
know
ye
not
still
volinè
is
your
friend
doctor
hermann
advanced
and
kissed
the
white
hand
extended
towards
him
and
did
his
best
to
convey
our
gratitude
to
the
generous
girl
telling
her
that
we
were
friends
fashioned
in
the
same
creative
mould
as
her
own
race
and
that
we
came
from
the
star
which
is
known
as
ramos
but
to
us
its
people
as
earth
that
we
had
come
to
study
this
new
world
of
hers
and
to
take
back
our
information
if
we
were
spared
to
do
so
to
our
john
temple
was
then
commanded
by
volinè
to
come
forward
and
salute
her
a
mark
of
royal
favour
of
which
he
was
not
slow
to
avail
himself
as
what
man
would
not
when
the
donor
was
so
ravishingly
beautiful
as
she
then
sandy
was
called
for
and
bidden
to
bring
rover
too
volinè
was
deeply
interested
and
asked
many
questions
through
kaosp
concerning
the
scotsman
and
his
dog
volinè
voice
was
distinctly
less
commanding
in
its
tone
even
tender
when
with
some
slight
hesitation
she
asked
that
graham
might
be
presented
to
her
and
as
he
came
forward
and
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
for
a
moment
we
all
noticed
a
blush
steal
over
her
lovely
face
as
a
special
mark
of
her
favour
she
bade
one
of
her
attendant
maidens
hand
to
him
the
flowers
she
was
carrying
graham
already
was
evidently
held
high
in
her
esteem
he
was
so
utterly
confounded
by
such
an
unexpected
mark
of
royal
favour
that
beyond
kissing
the
hand
held
out
to
him
he
was
unable
to
utter
a
word
of
gratitude
of
compliment
or
thanks
very
soon
after
this
the
interview
came
to
an
end
and
volinè
with
her
attendants
withdrew
leaving
us
to
recover
ourselves
as
if
from
some
delicious
dream
we
had
had
no
feminine
society
for
years
and
if
the
doctor
and
sandy
did
not
miss
it
certainly
graham
and
temple
did
and
appreciated
the
visit
of
this
peerless
maiden
to
the
uttermost
graham
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
doctor
and
temple
chaff
over
volinè
very
marked
notice
of
him
but
for
the
first
time
since
we
left
earth
he
failed
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
our
jokes
and
every
now
and
then
we
caught
him
as
though
engaged
in
deep
and
earnest
thought
the
magic
spell
of
a
first
love
was
beginning
to
work
within
him
and
from
this
time
forth
he
would
never
be
the
same
man
again
come
come
graham
my
boy
said
temple
on
the
following
day
as
the
two
sat
together
after
our
morning
meal
what
is
the
matter
with
you
why
so
melancholy
surely
volinè
is
not
the
first
pretty
face
you
have
seen
temple
answered
graham
your
last
stray
shot
has
hit
the
mark
no
woman
on
earth
you
know
as
well
as
i
is
so
incomparably
beautiful
as
she
volinè
is
a
goddess
the
soul
of
beauty
would
any
fellow
especially
situated
as
i
am
fancy
free
in
the
pride
of
early
manhood
escape
from
such
seductive
attractions
unscathed
from
the
moment
that
my
eyes
first
fell
upon
her
i
became
conscious
that
i
had
found
my
ideal
of
female
beauty
at
last
found
it
alas
under
circumstances
which
admit
of
no
hope
however
remote
to
become
ultimately
its
proud
possessor
i
have
tried
to
conceal
my
feeling
from
you
all
but
love
ever
betrays
itself
she
has
filled
my
thoughts
by
day
and
my
dreams
by
night
yes
i
love
her
and
it
is
at
least
consoling
to
be
able
to
confess
my
secret
to
such
an
old
and
tried
friend
as
you
it
relieves
my
feelings
in
some
measure
to
tell
them
to
another
who
can
show
some
sympathy
why
graham
you
must
be
hard
hit
indeed
but
your
chance
is
not
by
any
means
a
hopeless
one
from
what
we
can
see
volinè
is
certainly
interested
in
us
and
in
you
particularly
so
but
look
at
the
differences
of
our
race
and
station
ah
and
my
position
too
a
prisoner
whose
very
life
is
threatened
graham
sighed
all
the
more
need
for
you
to
put
matters
in
their
best
light
go
in
and
win
man
by
doing
so
you
may
gain
your
heart
desire
and
save
us
from
death
volinè
is
her
word
is
second
to
the
king
and
she
is
his
only
daughter
she
looks
upon
you
with
decided
favour
already
and
when
once
you
get
that
far
with
a
woman
the
rest
is
easy
it
is
certainly
so
with
the
ladies
of
earth
and
if
we
believe
in
doctor
hermann
theory
of
universality
the
maidens
of
mars
must
be
made
of
much
the
same
material
answered
temple
laughing
what
you
say
temple
certainly
puts
matters
in
a
different
light
that
flickering
phantom
men
call
hope
once
more
appears
before
me
and
bids
me
follow
but
whither
she
may
lead
me
is
very
doubtful
i
say
temple
and
graham
you
two
appear
to
have
a
very
serious
topic
for
your
conversation
this
morning
said
the
doctor
rising
from
his
seat
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
he
had
been
busy
writing
memoranda
in
his
the
doctor
was
here
interrupted
by
a
visit
from
kaosp
who
spent
the
remainder
of
the
morning
with
us
helping
us
to
acquire
the
martial
language
in
the
afternoon
we
had
another
visit
from
volinè
and
her
maidens
her
attention
to
graham
became
even
more
pronounced
and
she
never
seemed
to
tire
of
hearing
him
tell
to
her
the
story
of
earth
indeed
so
much
did
she
appear
to
enjoy
his
company
that
the
doctor
and
temple
felt
completely
the
doctor
appeared
annoyed
at
graham
for
encouraging
this
flirtation
but
temple
was
secretly
pleased
for
he
saw
in
it
a
possible
escape
from
captivity
that
night
graham
retired
to
rest
earlier
than
usual
pleading
a
headache
for
excuse
we
now
had
complete
use
of
the
two
apartments
thanks
to
kaosp
the
door
separating
them
having
been
made
to
open
and
close
at
our
will
the
doctor
and
temple
remained
up
discussing
one
thing
and
another
until
a
late
hour
the
conversation
eventually
turning
to
the
subject
of
volinè
and
graham
doctor
i
think
it
is
rather
a
mistake
on
your
part
to
show
such
an
aversion
to
graham
conduct
with
volinè
you
were
the
first
to
express
an
opinion
and
even
to
hint
that
this
girl
might
be
of
service
how
so
it
bound
to
end
in
trouble
not
only
to
him
but
to
us
and
as
for
the
latter
part
of
your
remarks
why
it
was
only
a
silly
joke
on
my
part
i
differ
from
you
doctor
this
woman
is
here
the
king
may
govern
his
people
but
his
daughter
governs
him
although
he
may
not
know
it
what
man
ever
does
and
if
we
can
once
gain
her
good
word
say
even
through
her
betrothal
to
graham
we
are
absolutely
safe
all
very
well
all
very
well
temple
if
things
would
turn
out
so
but
when
do
things
turn
out
exactly
as
we
want
them
there
is
much
to
be
said
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
kings
have
peculiar
ideas
as
to
rank
and
station
princesses
even
in
the
nineteenth
century
may
not
choose
their
own
partners
at
least
as
far
as
our
world
is
concerned
i
dare
say
the
king
has
his
own
views
respecting
his
daughter
and
then
when
this
foolish
affair
becomes
known
as
it
surely
will
we
shall
only
incur
a
still
larger
amount
of
royal
anger
than
we
do
at
present
it
is
too
risky
a
business
and
i
will
be
no
party
to
it
pray
let
us
drop
the
subject
temple
the
hour
is
late
and
we
had
better
go
to
rest
as
you
will
doctor
but
as
sure
as
i
am
sitting
here
i
am
convinced
that
a
love
affair
between
graham
and
volinè
is
our
only
chance
we
shall
see
temple
it
is
playing
a
dangerous
game
with
our
own
lives
as
well
as
his
own
and
i
am
just
as
certain
that
it
will
end
in
disaster
volinè
visits
became
more
and
more
frequent
rarely
a
day
passed
now
that
she
did
not
either
come
in
person
or
send
one
of
her
attendant
maids
with
flowers
or
fruits
for
the
captives
but
these
gifts
were
really
meant
for
graham
alone
she
exercised
her
royal
prerogative
and
showed
her
marked
preference
for
him
in
many
ways
we
were
also
allowed
more
liberty
presumably
through
her
intercession
and
were
now
even
permitted
to
walk
for
a
short
time
each
day
in
an
enclosed
garden
below
our
prison
windows
this
was
a
great
boon
as
the
close
confinement
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
us
greatly
seasoned
as
we
were
to
the
lack
of
exercise
through
our
long
sojourn
in
the
we
had
been
in
prison
five
weeks
when
the
love
affair
between
graham
and
volinè
assumed
a
more
decided
phase
volinè
and
he
were
lovers
more
to
each
other
than
either
thought
or
knew
fierce
and
uncontrollable
love
was
smouldering
in
each
heart
requiring
but
some
accidental
spark
to
set
the
whole
aflame
this
was
not
long
in
coming
a
secret
meeting
was
arranged
between
them
kaosp
being
ambassador
he
conveyed
the
welcome
news
to
graham
that
volinè
wished
to
see
him
in
the
grounds
needless
to
say
the
doctor
was
highly
displeased
at
this
but
being
in
the
minority
he
had
the
good
sense
to
let
matters
take
their
own
course
satisfying
himself
by
warning
graham
of
the
risk
he
ran
kaosp
too
showed
some
reluctance
to
be
a
party
to
this
meeting
he
feared
discovery
and
the
king
anger
but
pressure
had
evidently
been
put
upon
him
and
as
the
dusk
of
evening
deepened
he
came
and
secretly
conducted
graham
to
the
garden
below
graham
must
of
necessity
tell
this
portion
of
our
narrative
in
his
own
words
i
followed
kaosp
at
his
bidding
down
the
silent
deserted
corridors
and
at
last
felt
the
cool
refreshing
night
air
beat
against
my
face
as
we
passed
under
an
arched
gateway
of
the
palace
into
the
open
grounds
here
he
left
me
telling
me
to
keep
along
a
narrow
pathway
until
i
came
to
an
arbour
where
i
was
to
wait
until
volinè
joined
me
the
night
was
gloriously
fine
the
martial
moons
were
beaming
in
a
cloudless
sky
the
stars
scintillated
sharp
as
swords
in
the
heavens
the
earth
shone
with
a
dazzling
fairness
the
star
of
the
evening
flowers
threw
off
delicious
fragrance
though
i
could
not
see
them
here
and
there
a
tall
tapering
tree
towering
far
above
the
lower
vegetation
of
this
wondrous
garden
shone
out
clearly
against
the
sky
whilst
distant
fountains
sang
their
soothing
song
oh
how
can
i
express
the
expectant
rapture
that
filled
my
soul
as
i
watched
and
waited
for
my
darling
with
wings
the
moments
dragged
along
and
yet
she
came
not
was
all
a
dream
if
so
oh
god
then
let
me
dream
for
ever
for
the
suspense
of
waiting
for
volinè
in
that
garden
fair
would
be
paradise
compared
with
the
pain
of
awaking
and
finding
that
all
had
vanished
with
my
opening
eyes
soft
yet
distant
footsteps
at
last
fell
upon
my
eager
ears
and
she
for
whom
i
waited
came
stealthily
along
towards
our
we
met
as
lovers
of
long
standing
even
though
no
single
word
of
love
had
passed
between
us
the
kiss
i
reverently
pressed
upon
her
white
upturned
brow
was
the
first
i
had
ever
given
her
but
the
language
of
love
is
universal
neither
race
nor
dialect
forms
a
barrier
to
the
communication
of
its
sweet
secrets
one
to
the
other
beloved
i
whispered
trembling
with
joy
for
whom
i
have
waited
so
long
have
come
to
me
at
last
man
of
ramos
i
am
so
happy
to
be
with
thee
she
answered
as
i
drew
her
gently
within
the
shelter
of
the
arbour
and
sat
down
by
her
side
volinè
will
you
not
call
me
harry
i
ask
it
as
a
royal
favour
harry
is
not
thy
name
still
to
please
thee
i
will
grant
thy
request
harry
harry
is
much
prettier
too
i
had
not
thought
of
that
i
had
volinè
and
have
been
longing
to
hear
my
name
fall
from
your
sweet
lips
fear
harry
that
i
shall
incur
my
father
anger
in
coming
thus
i
have
dared
his
wrath
because
i
like
thee
and
thy
companions
much
and
because
i
would
save
thee
and
them
from
all
harm
now
tell
me
all
concerning
thyself
for
my
soul
is
curious
to
know
tell
me
harry
more
of
that
mystic
world
from
whence
you
came
are
the
women
of
that
world
more
fair
more
beautiful
than
we
doth
no
maid
of
ramos
hold
thy
heart
in
bondage
hath
not
that
power
you
tell
me
the
sons
and
daughters
of
earth
call
love
yet
had
no
in
thy
soul
and
as
she
spoke
these
last
words
volinè
laid
her
head
upon
my
breast
and
gazed
up
into
my
face
with
her
radiant
eyes
as
though
she
would
read
the
innermost
depths
of
my
soul
volinè
volinè
of
a
truth
i
tell
you
no
woman
has
yet
moved
my
heart
like
you
have
done
i
answered
gazing
down
into
her
peerless
face
my
pulses
thrilled
by
the
magnetic
touch
of
her
soft
white
hand
resting
trustfully
in
my
own
and
by
the
vision
of
her
marvellous
beauty
her
breath
intoxicated
me
with
its
warm
rich
fragrance
her
throbbing
heart
against
my
own
filled
my
senses
with
the
wild
delirium
of
passionate
ecstasy
i
whispered
the
maidens
of
that
earth
star
yonder
glimmering
serenely
fair
in
the
evening
sky
are
good
and
pure
and
with
no
mean
measure
of
beauty
even
volinè
as
you
are
good
and
as
you
are
pure
but
such
beauty
as
yours
is
unknown
amongst
them
man
only
knows
of
beauty
such
as
yours
in
the
holy
legends
of
his
heaven
only
the
angels
of
his
faith
are
decked
in
such
graces
as
are
yours
but
in
his
mortal
life
he
knows
them
not
save
by
imagination
and
as
they
have
been
revealed
to
him
such
peerless
queenly
beauty
as
yours
volinè
no
mortal
man
beheld
before
such
winning
grace
such
maidenly
charm
are
what
we
men
of
earth
would
call
immortal
and
divine
thy
words
are
sweet
unto
me
and
i
feel
that
they
flow
from
thy
heart
but
i
would
have
thee
tell
me
more
of
that
love
by
which
these
men
of
earth
enslave
her
daughters
thy
words
are
full
of
flattery
of
my
bodily
form
is
there
nought
else
to
charm
thee
and
bind
thee
closer
to
me
to
unite
thine
immortal
soul
to
mine
my
arm
stole
gently
round
volinè
shapely
waist
without
resistance
what
bliss
and
i
drew
her
yet
nearer
to
me
ere
i
made
reply
my
darling
i
know
nothing
from
experience
of
this
love
of
which
you
bid
me
tell
and
of
which
you
are
so
curious
to
hear
no
woman
on
that
yonder
has
won
it
from
my
heart
until
i
saw
you
i
knew
not
love
but
now
its
fires
consume
me
volinè
i
love
you
as
never
man
loved
woman
yet
for
you
i
would
die
and
in
dying
glorify
and
exalt
that
love
you
have
inspired
say
volinè
that
you
return
my
love
and
make
my
happiness
complete
thou
art
dearer
to
me
than
all
men
nobles
and
princes
of
high
degree
have
sought
to
woo
me
but
until
i
knew
thee
i
knew
not
the
secret
of
my
own
heart
you
dear
one
for
those
precious
words
i
answered
trembling
in
my
great
joy
the
love
that
is
born
of
desire
is
sweet
but
the
mysterious
power
that
welds
two
hearts
together
making
them
throb
as
one
and
bringing
perfect
harmony
to
both
is
sweeter
still
in
willing
rapture
i
yielded
to
the
captivity
of
her
arms
which
like
bonds
of
ivory
whiteness
held
me
i
felt
her
smooth
cheek
against
my
own
burning
with
modesty
and
love
and
in
my
happiness
i
rained
hot
kisses
on
her
upturned
willing
lips
closer
and
closer
we
stole
into
each
other
arms
our
sighs
mingled
together
time
for
us
had
now
no
measure
we
lived
but
for
each
other
and
in
silent
ecstasy
we
drank
those
pleasures
that
mutual
love
alone
distils
harry
someone
approaches
i
shall
die
of
shame
to
be
discovered
thus
and
my
father
wrath
will
be
terrible
darling
no
one
shall
harm
you
while
i
am
by
your
side
and
i
gripped
with
my
right
hand
my
revolver
but
no
one
came
to
disturb
the
measure
of
our
happiness
and
the
joyful
moments
all
too
fleeting
slipped
rapidly
away
now
i
must
bid
thee
leave
me
the
hour
is
getting
late
and
my
absence
may
be
discovered
volinè
on
earth
among
my
english
race
when
man
makes
love
unto
a
woman
he
pledges
his
troth
to
her
with
a
ring
of
gold
set
with
jewels
or
precious
stones
which
she
the
object
of
his
choice
wears
as
a
token
upon
the
fourth
finger
of
her
left
hand
so
take
this
ring
of
mine
as
our
let
me
place
it
on
your
finger
so
and
promise
me
to
wear
it
always
there
for
my
sake
words
are
strange
harry
for
no
such
custom
is
known
to
us
but
what
a
pretty
idea
though
i
will
take
thy
ring
and
wear
it
as
thou
sayest
but
thou
must
have
one
of
mine
in
return
and
as
she
spoke
volinè
slipped
a
ring
of
curious
workmanship
from
her
finger
and
placed
it
on
my
own
it
as
thou
wouldst
prize
me
guard
it
as
thou
wouldst
guard
thy
life
for
it
is
a
precious
talisman
and
was
given
to
my
mother
by
echri
the
most
sacred
of
our
priests
no
man
of
gathma
dare
harm
or
slay
thee
if
he
knows
that
ring
is
on
thy
hand
darling
i
will
part
with
it
only
with
my
life
now
one
more
fond
embrace
ere
you
go
and
with
it
i
would
crave
your
promise
to
meet
me
here
again
at
the
same
hour
but
the
sentence
was
never
finished
for
a
martial
who
by
his
dress
and
mien
i
judged
to
be
someone
of
high
degree
stepped
out
from
the
arbour
shadow
into
the
moonlight
saying
in
a
contemptuous
voice
as
he
came
volinè
it
is
thee
meeting
one
of
thy
father
prisoners
here
at
this
hour
and
alone
to
bestow
thy
favours
and
to
lose
thy
honour
edos
shall
ring
with
thy
shame
before
another
sun
hath
set
and
this
evil
stranger
from
the
ramos
and
all
his
foul
companions
shall
pay
with
their
lives
for
his
insolent
temerity
this
night
with
a
scream
of
terror
volinè
tore
herself
away
from
my
embrace
and
fled
towards
the
palace
leaving
me
alone
with
the
stranger
who
are
you
i
asked
question
volinè
right
to
meet
whomsoever
she
may
please
am
i
why
should
i
gratify
thy
curiosity
thou
dirt
of
ramos
for
little
i
would
kill
thee
where
thou
standest
get
thee
back
to
thy
prison
cell
and
prepare
to
die
for
die
thou
surely
shalt
am
i
you
martial
bully
that
insult
shall
be
wiped
away
at
another
time
and
in
another
place
but
by
what
right
do
you
dictate
to
her
breathe
her
name
in
scandal
to
a
living
soul
and
i
will
thrash
you
like
the
cur
you
are
nay
more
the
lying
shame
you
bring
upon
her
shall
be
washed
away
in
your
own
worthless
blood
the
right
of
being
her
affianced
lover
he
hissed
rather
than
spoke
and
turning
round
walked
quickly
away
into
the
gloom
i
shouted
as
i
watched
his
retreating
form
for
a
moment
to
shoot
him
as
he
went
but
prudence
forbade
such
a
course
and
slowly
i
returned
to
the
arched
doorway
where
i
found
kaosp
anxiously
waiting
to
conduct
me
back
again
not
a
word
did
i
breathe
to
anyone
of
my
adventure
in
the
garden
although
i
lay
awake
until
the
yellow
dawn
thinking
of
volinè
and
of
my
rival
and
wondering
greatly
what
the
future
would
bring
chapter
xii
condemned
to
die
in
spite
of
all
the
questions
put
by
temple
and
the
doctor
graham
resolutely
refused
to
speak
about
his
meeting
with
volinè
in
the
garden
and
this
annoyed
the
doctor
especially
i
do
like
this
want
of
confidence
on
your
part
graham
he
said
the
following
day
not
that
i
want
to
pry
into
a
lover
secrets
by
any
means
but
our
trial
as
you
well
know
takes
place
in
a
few
days
and
i
think
as
being
the
leader
of
this
expedition
recognised
as
such
by
common
consent
and
the
duty
of
defending
ourselves
rightly
falling
on
me
every
fact
that
might
be
of
service
to
us
should
be
known
to
me
as
well
as
any
adverse
circumstances
that
may
resolve
into
evidence
against
us
so
that
i
may
be
prepared
to
meet
it
doctor
graham
answered
i
admit
the
justness
of
your
remarks
but
am
sorry
i
can
not
disclose
what
took
place
last
night
the
honour
of
the
woman
i
love
is
involved
but
rest
assured
i
am
quite
prepared
to
defend
my
conduct
if
called
upon
to
do
so
believe
me
nothing
whatever
was
said
respecting
our
position
nor
did
i
obtain
any
information
likely
to
be
of
service
to
us
but
did
you
really
see
and
speak
to
volinè
last
night
asked
temple
i
admit
that
i
did
now
do
rest
content
with
that
there
good
fellows
and
be
assured
that
i
am
doing
the
best
i
can
for
us
all
this
ring
i
wear
upon
my
finger
was
given
to
me
by
her
with
the
solemn
assurance
that
it
was
a
talisman
against
evil
fudge
graham
you
must
be
deep
in
love
to
believe
such
nonsense
said
the
doctor
testily
nonsense
or
not
doctor
you
see
i
wear
it
and
what
is
more
am
inclined
to
believe
in
its
virtues
it
may
be
but
a
lover
trifle
but
some
strange
instinct
call
it
superstition
if
you
like
makes
me
feel
that
it
will
yet
be
of
service
to
us
well
it
is
my
unbroken
experience
that
if
discord
or
trouble
comes
a
woman
is
invariably
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
with
this
parting
shot
the
doctor
walked
away
to
study
his
what
a
prejudice
the
doctor
has
against
the
ladies
graham
said
temple
why
he
is
a
regular
depend
upon
it
some
girl
broke
his
heart
in
the
long
ago
it
is
his
only
failing
and
he
is
to
be
pitied
more
than
blamed
graham
answered
kaosp
entered
at
this
moment
his
face
wore
a
grave
look
and
he
was
unusually
silent
graham
alone
guessed
the
cause
for
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
what
took
place
within
the
garden
on
the
previous
night
was
now
known
to
him
although
he
never
alluded
to
it
in
any
way
he
did
not
stay
long
and
after
enquiring
about
our
health
and
various
little
matters
he
shook
each
one
of
us
by
the
hand
as
was
his
custom
now
every
time
he
went
away
this
mode
of
salutation
greatly
took
his
fancy
after
we
had
explained
it
to
him
and
he
seemed
proud
of
his
new
accomplishment
when
graham
turn
to
shake
hands
with
him
came
he
started
in
surprise
and
drawing
back
exclaimed
volinè
talisman
how
camest
thou
by
that
thou
the
charm
of
that
ring
dost
thou
know
that
he
whose
finger
carries
it
is
safe
from
every
harm
that
men
of
gathma
can
work
it
is
a
passport
from
death
itself
for
it
is
the
sacred
ring
of
echri
the
most
powerful
of
our
priests
before
whom
the
king
himself
must
bow
good
kaosp
i
came
by
it
honestly
this
ring
was
given
to
me
by
volinè
herself
and
by
her
its
wondrous
power
was
told
to
me
but
these
my
companions
ridicule
its
potency
and
refuse
to
believe
in
its
talismanic
properties
they
know
not
what
they
say
i
have
heard
and
seen
too
much
of
its
virtues
to
scoff
at
its
power
but
guard
it
jealously
for
i
would
warn
thee
against
its
loss
no
man
of
gathma
will
dare
to
take
it
from
thee
for
if
thou
hast
received
it
as
a
gift
that
man
is
cursed
who
would
seek
to
rob
thee
of
it
by
force
or
yet
by
stealth
not
very
likely
kaosp
for
i
will
part
with
it
only
with
my
life
graham
answered
as
the
soldier
passed
out
well
doctor
what
do
you
say
now
asked
graham
that
it
all
humbug
and
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
wish
volinè
and
her
ring
had
been
far
away
before
we
had
the
misfortune
to
visit
edos
the
arrival
of
our
meal
interrupted
further
conversation
nor
did
either
of
us
allude
to
the
subject
again
day
after
day
passed
by
kaosp
coming
in
as
usual
but
he
was
reticent
his
visits
were
shorter
and
in
spite
of
all
that
graham
could
do
we
saw
that
he
evaded
his
questions
another
thing
that
perplexed
us
exceedingly
was
the
absence
of
volinè
from
the
day
that
graham
met
her
in
the
garden
she
had
never
been
to
see
us
herself
nor
had
she
sent
any
of
her
attendants
with
presents
what
had
befallen
her
we
knew
not
all
was
mystery
kaosp
would
not
speak
on
the
subject
this
had
a
most
depressing
effect
upon
graham
he
rarely
ate
and
still
more
rarely
slept
we
could
see
that
his
heart
was
heavy
at
her
absence
and
his
failing
to
obtain
any
news
whatever
of
his
loved
one
made
him
morose
dispirited
and
silent
for
the
love
of
heaven
he
said
to
kaosp
on
the
day
before
our
trial
will
you
not
tell
me
news
of
her
you
must
know
what
has
taken
place
has
any
harm
befallen
her
i
am
commanded
by
the
king
to
silence
he
answered
not
without
sorrow
in
his
voice
he
hath
bidden
me
hold
no
further
conversation
with
you
his
prisoners
you
will
know
all
on
the
morrow
the
eventful
morning
dawned
at
last
that
was
to
decide
our
fate
to
set
us
free
or
mete
to
us
our
doom
thank
heaven
said
graham
earnestly
all
will
soon
be
decided
this
silence
this
suspense
is
slowly
killing
me
outside
we
could
hear
that
something
unusual
was
taking
place
the
heavy
tramp
of
troops
echoed
from
the
distance
in
muffled
tones
trumpet
blasts
at
intervals
sounded
afar
off
as
if
an
army
was
being
marshalled
and
from
time
to
time
the
noise
of
hurrying
feet
was
heard
in
the
corridor
outside
for
the
first
time
kaosp
failed
to
visit
us
new
guards
came
attending
the
servants
that
brought
us
our
morning
meal
we
were
all
too
excited
to
eat
and
the
dishes
were
taken
away
almost
untouched
one
last
word
to
you
all
said
the
doctor
whatever
may
be
the
result
of
this
trial
be
sure
not
to
exhibit
any
anger
it
will
be
no
time
nor
place
to
strike
for
freedom
in
yonder
hall
of
justice
for
such
could
only
end
in
failure
keep
cool
i
implore
you
whatever
the
decision
may
be
we
must
wait
and
watch
our
opportunity
a
few
minutes
before
ten
our
prison
doors
were
opened
and
we
were
commanded
by
kaosp
and
the
guards
to
follow
them
we
went
in
single
file
our
dog
bringing
up
the
rear
passing
along
the
corridors
which
were
lined
with
martial
troops
on
either
side
through
doorway
after
doorway
until
we
reached
an
which
we
had
not
visited
before
here
we
were
detained
for
a
few
moments
then
amidst
a
fanfare
of
trumpets
we
passed
onward
and
entered
the
great
hall
of
justice
the
brilliant
scene
was
much
the
same
as
on
our
previous
visit
but
more
solemnity
seemed
to
pervade
the
vast
gathering
we
heard
the
hum
of
voices
before
we
reached
the
hall
but
as
we
entered
a
great
silence
fell
upon
the
assembled
throng
and
every
eye
was
turned
towards
us
as
we
slowly
wended
our
way
to
the
platform
and
stepped
one
by
one
upon
it
a
hundred
thousand
martials
of
both
sexes
and
apparently
of
the
highest
grade
of
society
filled
that
vast
hall
and
from
the
tumult
we
could
hear
outside
as
many
more
must
have
been
clustering
round
in
eager
curiosity
the
king
and
his
ministers
sat
in
their
old
places
and
below
them
were
a
hundred
scribes
whose
business
appeared
to
be
to
take
down
in
writing
all
that
was
said
we
noticed
more
soldiers
than
before
and
the
guard
immediately
surrounding
us
had
been
considerably
augmented
directly
we
got
upon
the
platform
graham
eyes
wandered
round
the
circle
where
the
king
and
his
ministers
sat
his
search
was
for
volinè
but
his
quest
was
vain
for
the
luxurious
throne
upon
which
she
had
reclined
was
empty
the
vacant
seat
was
the
last
drop
in
the
cup
of
his
bitterness
and
his
face
reflected
the
great
sorrow
that
ate
like
a
canker
into
his
heart
deserted
and
lonely
even
more
so
than
we
were
his
sufferings
were
deeper
than
those
of
his
comrades
and
he
faced
his
judges
like
one
in
a
dream
the
proceedings
were
commenced
at
once
by
the
king
who
from
his
throne
commanded
that
the
evidence
against
us
should
be
given
the
same
aged
minister
amid
a
deathlike
silence
rose
and
bowing
to
the
king
arraigned
us
thus
great
and
mighty
ruler
king
of
gathma
and
father
of
its
people
we
have
assembled
here
in
this
our
justice
hall
to
conduct
the
strangest
proceedings
that
have
ever
taken
place
between
its
ancient
walls
we
are
here
to
mete
out
fair
and
impartial
justice
to
beings
who
belong
not
to
the
world
on
which
we
live
but
have
come
unbidden
amongst
us
from
a
region
so
remote
that
it
appears
but
a
bright
and
wandering
planet
in
our
heavens
for
have
they
not
said
that
they
are
from
the
star
ramos
which
they
call
earth
beyond
our
own
moons
ramos
is
the
nearest
orb
to
us
but
its
distance
is
so
vast
that
no
man
of
science
in
gathma
hath
yet
been
bold
enough
to
say
the
space
between
our
world
and
this
can
ever
be
traversed
by
men
in
mortal
shape
who
shall
survive
the
journey
this
being
so
we
can
only
look
upon
these
strangers
as
practisers
of
some
magic
art
which
they
may
ultimately
employ
to
the
danger
of
our
people
they
came
here
borne
in
a
carriage
of
curious
form
and
cunning
workmanship
dropping
from
the
sky
to
the
east
of
edos
their
arrival
is
immediately
celebrated
in
bloodshed
for
the
inoffensive
osa
a
tiller
of
the
soil
was
killed
by
some
explosive
machine
carried
in
their
hand
which
was
turned
upon
him
here
a
great
trooper
clad
in
armour
stepped
forward
and
pointed
with
his
weapon
to
sandy
and
his
wife
and
children
are
even
now
mourning
sorely
for
his
death
when
pressed
they
fled
to
their
curious
carriage
and
escaped
into
the
sky
whither
no
one
of
gathma
could
follow
them
but
instead
of
leaving
us
in
peace
they
had
the
temerity
to
advance
through
the
air
towards
our
city
edos
and
to
descend
therein
in
the
very
precincts
of
thy
royal
palace
they
speak
a
strange
tongue
their
dress
their
manners
and
customs
are
mysterious
their
mission
here
seems
one
of
blood
hath
not
holy
echri
foretold
a
great
calamity
to
our
people
heralded
by
signs
and
appearances
in
the
heavens
from
which
we
may
escape
if
we
only
act
with
courage
and
promptitude
methinks
these
strangers
are
this
sign
then
we
must
take
heed
of
holy
echri
words
of
warning
and
so
destroy
these
men
of
ramos
that
not
a
trace
of
them
shall
be
left
let
them
and
their
evil
carriage
be
hurled
into
the
lake
of
melag
from
the
crag
remagaloth
so
that
all
may
be
consumed
in
living
fire
and
we
may
see
them
no
more
oh
mighty
king
and
father
i
beseech
thee
in
thy
wisdom
to
heed
the
words
of
thy
faithful
servant
whose
hair
hath
grown
hoary
with
the
work
of
three
hundred
years
in
thy
illustrious
service
justice
shall
be
done
osa
be
avenged
and
gathma
saved
if
thou
shalt
only
bid
these
strangers
die
this
speech
made
a
profound
sensation
and
was
greeted
with
a
thunder
of
applause
from
the
surrounding
multitude
as
the
aged
councillor
bowed
low
and
returned
to
his
seat
clearly
popular
opinion
was
on
his
side
and
we
feared
that
our
doom
was
sealed
graham
alone
felt
relieved
when
the
speech
was
done
for
to
his
great
though
secret
joy
volinè
name
had
not
been
mentioned
and
evidently
the
king
and
his
councillors
were
in
ignorance
of
his
love
for
her
and
the
untoward
occurrence
in
the
garden
his
rival
had
not
dared
to
do
as
he
had
threatened
after
all
now
strangers
from
ramos
said
the
king
have
you
aught
to
say
to
vindicate
yourselves
no
man
shall
be
judged
unfairly
or
condemned
unheard
speak
so
that
we
may
know
your
history
and
learn
if
there
be
aught
to
swing
the
balance
of
justice
in
your
favour
kaosp
hath
informed
me
that
you
are
now
able
to
converse
in
our
tongue
and
therefore
to
understand
the
charges
that
have
been
laid
against
you
hereupon
doctor
hermann
with
in
hand
stepped
forward
amidst
a
breathless
silence
and
said
king
of
gathma
and
citizens
of
edos
i
and
my
companions
appear
before
you
under
circumstances
which
place
us
unfortunately
at
a
great
disadvantage
we
came
to
visit
your
world
bearing
tidings
of
peace
and
bringing
news
of
your
brothers
out
yonder
on
the
star
ramos
hoping
to
return
to
them
in
due
season
as
messengers
of
your
goodwill
and
partakers
of
your
hospitality
and
kindness
but
evil
fortune
overtook
us
as
soon
as
we
descended
upon
your
soil
and
to
our
everlasting
regret
our
first
intercourse
with
your
people
has
ended
fatally
for
one
of
your
subjects
believe
it
or
not
o
king
but
this
husbandman
whom
you
call
osa
threatened
us
with
a
deadly
weapon
with
which
he
had
already
slain
some
beast
to
intimidate
us
and
to
prove
his
prowess
and
we
purely
in
drew
our
firearms
and
struck
him
dead
we
came
here
to
gathma
only
as
explorers
and
men
of
science
in
quest
of
knowledge
we
have
no
desire
to
slay
your
people
nor
to
work
them
harm
of
magic
we
know
nothing
we
are
flesh
and
blood
as
yourselves
seekers
after
truth
who
have
braved
the
perils
of
a
frightful
voyage
across
the
realms
of
space
with
no
other
motive
than
to
extend
the
philosophy
of
man
my
life
has
been
spent
in
solving
the
secrets
that
barred
man
way
across
the
noble
pathway
of
the
planets
my
companions
have
assisted
me
by
their
labour
and
by
their
riches
to
make
that
attempt
which
we
thought
we
had
crowned
with
such
brilliant
success
for
more
than
two
long
years
have
we
sped
onwards
and
onwards
across
the
silent
sky
threatened
by
dangers
so
awful
that
we
recall
them
even
now
with
horror
and
yet
we
find
enemies
in
this
new
world
instead
of
friends
our
bodies
are
weary
and
fain
would
rest
yet
we
only
meet
with
strife
and
we
are
condemned
to
die
the
most
horrible
of
deaths
because
we
did
what
any
of
you
placed
as
we
were
would
have
done
in
we
are
not
cowards
we
are
not
afraid
to
die
but
in
the
name
of
science
we
plead
for
nay
demand
our
lives
so
that
we
may
return
to
earth
and
tell
our
brothers
yonder
of
the
wonders
of
this
new
world
the
doctor
sat
down
amid
a
murmur
of
voices
but
whether
of
approval
or
dissent
we
were
unable
to
say
then
the
king
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
made
silence
and
in
a
more
friendly
voice
he
said
wilt
not
thy
companions
speak
to
us
as
well
have
they
got
nought
to
say
say
what
you
can
in
martial
temple
it
seems
to
be
expected
of
us
said
the
doctor
in
an
undertone
king
and
citizens
of
edos
said
temple
the
words
i
shall
say
are
few
for
my
tongue
is
not
so
fluent
of
your
language
as
that
of
my
friend
who
has
already
spoken
his
words
are
my
words
but
i
would
ask
you
to
let
his
great
attainments
as
a
man
of
science
plead
in
his
favour
his
name
is
justly
honoured
among
the
men
of
earth
and
he
has
triumphed
over
the
secrets
of
the
universe
in
a
manner
which
should
claim
the
respect
and
gratitude
of
such
a
wise
and
people
as
yourselves
rather
than
your
hatred
i
can
only
say
that
the
crime
for
which
we
stand
on
trial
was
justifiable
and
needs
no
penalty
to
purge
it
we
shall
be
willing
to
live
amongst
you
for
a
season
and
to
teach
you
much
that
can
not
fail
to
be
of
inestimable
service
to
your
race
in
condemning
us
to
die
you
rob
yourselves
and
become
guilty
of
a
crime
that
a
just
god
will
visit
with
punishment
as
temple
withdrew
sandy
came
to
the
front
and
in
excited
english
asked
that
mercy
might
be
shown
to
his
companions
if
ye
want
to
murder
somebody
murder
me
these
gentlemen
here
had
no
hand
in
shooting
that
farmer
chap
i
did
it
mysel
for
the
fellow
was
after
murderin
o
us
there
wa
mischief
lurking
in
his
ugly
een
i
tell
ye
they
be
as
innocent
as
the
lambs
on
the
hillsides
i
did
it
mysel
and
am
ready
to
dee
for
the
deed
but
let
innocent
men
alone
he
had
spoken
so
far
although
not
a
word
was
understood
save
by
us
and
perhaps
by
kaosp
before
graham
could
quieten
him
hold
your
tongue
sandy
he
said
they
ca
understand
you
leave
it
to
us
we
will
do
all
we
can
for
your
sake
as
well
as
our
own
that
true
graham
but
the
blood
o
the
within
me
boils
wi
honest
indignation
when
i
see
innocent
men
treated
as
criminals
graham
now
came
to
the
front
of
the
platform
to
speak
we
all
felt
proud
of
him
as
he
stood
erect
and
defiant
before
the
multitude
tall
and
strong
but
with
face
pale
and
furrowed
with
nights
of
sleepless
anxiety
over
the
fate
of
volinè
the
king
scanned
him
closely
and
seemed
impressed
by
his
bold
and
manly
bearing
and
we
noticed
many
of
the
ladies
near
us
women
fair
and
as
goddesses
each
one
of
them
scrutinizing
him
closely
and
whispering
one
to
the
other
king
and
people
of
gathma
he
commenced
my
comrades
and
myself
have
listened
in
sorrow
more
than
anger
to
the
words
of
your
learned
councillor
and
we
fain
would
ask
you
o
king
in
your
royal
wisdom
to
set
such
bigoted
utterances
aside
and
to
decide
our
case
on
its
simple
merits
we
came
to
your
world
as
friends
but
we
are
treated
as
the
vilest
of
enemies
because
we
killed
one
who
in
another
moment
would
have
slain
us
your
weapons
are
more
deadly
than
our
own
as
we
had
ample
testimony
before
we
struck
a
blow
and
this
osa
treated
us
in
no
friendly
spirit
giving
us
no
opportunity
of
explaining
ourselves
to
him
right
gladly
would
we
have
done
so
that
we
killed
him
we
do
not
deny
but
to
say
that
the
deed
was
premeditated
and
done
in
malice
is
to
say
that
which
is
false
we
did
not
seek
to
escape
the
consequences
of
our
act
or
we
could
readily
have
done
so
in
the
carriage
that
bore
us
hither
we
came
to
this
city
at
once
and
yielded
ourselves
to
your
authority
without
resistance
as
kaosp
a
worthy
captain
of
your
troops
can
bear
testimony
we
are
anxious
to
be
friends
to
knit
together
the
peoples
of
earth
and
gathma
in
tranquil
unity
we
hold
out
the
hand
of
brotherhood
the
olive
branch
of
peace
from
our
world
to
yours
grasp
it
in
the
same
spirit
in
which
it
is
extended
towards
you
and
let
each
race
strangers
now
no
more
reap
the
rich
harvest
of
mutual
benefits
my
comrades
and
myself
have
dared
and
done
so
much
to
sow
graham
words
produced
a
marked
impression
in
our
favour
with
the
king
which
he
was
not
unwilling
to
show
but
before
he
uttered
the
words
we
could
see
he
was
about
to
speak
a
martial
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
a
prince
or
noble
rose
to
his
feet
and
in
a
voice
of
thunder
said
enough
these
men
of
ramos
have
spoken
well
and
with
an
oily
tongue
o
king
but
hearken
to
my
tidings
before
thy
majesty
decides
their
fate
one
of
them
standing
here
before
thee
hath
stained
his
hands
with
the
innocent
blood
of
thy
subject
osa
but
what
is
osa
blood
compared
with
the
dignity
of
a
mighty
monarch
and
the
honour
of
that
monarch
daughter
the
tallest
of
these
men
of
ramos
here
before
thee
he
who
with
his
persuasive
tongue
addressed
thee
last
hath
dared
to
hold
private
converse
with
thy
daughter
volinè
to
steal
her
heart
and
to
mantle
her
with
shame
with
mine
own
ears
i
heard
the
sweet
yet
poisoned
words
of
yon
seducer
poured
into
thy
innocent
daughter
ears
with
mine
own
eyes
did
i
see
them
locked
in
tight
embrace
within
an
arbour
in
thy
garden
of
at
an
hour
when
no
maiden
should
wander
forth
unattended
if
my
words
are
lies
why
is
not
volinè
here
by
her
father
side
as
is
her
unvarying
custom
why
doth
she
shun
our
company
and
why
doth
yonder
stripling
from
ramos
carry
the
sacred
ring
of
echri
upon
his
finger
a
gift
from
her
why
base
bully
graham
shouted
unable
to
control
his
anger
longer
coward
who
would
seek
to
rob
a
woman
of
all
that
is
dearer
to
her
than
life
you
lie
volinè
is
as
pure
and
as
free
from
sin
as
a
babe
unborn
her
soul
is
whiter
than
the
snows
on
your
mountains
highest
points
and
the
day
shall
yet
come
when
i
yes
will
make
you
proclaim
her
innocence
as
loudly
as
you
now
have
cried
her
shame
by
god
graham
and
if
ye
want
any
help
sandy
will
be
there
shouted
sandy
carried
away
in
his
excitement
at
the
prospect
of
a
fight
yet
understanding
little
of
what
was
being
said
graham
was
prevented
by
a
dozen
guards
from
saying
more
but
we
noticed
that
not
a
man
amongst
them
treated
him
roughly
did
the
ring
he
wore
possess
the
magic
power
of
which
we
had
been
told
the
king
was
now
filled
with
rage
anger
so
hot
and
violent
filled
his
heart
that
we
could
see
he
controlled
it
with
the
greatest
effort
and
the
multitude
of
spectators
were
worked
up
into
a
state
of
frenzy
by
what
had
just
been
said
no
language
can
express
our
amazement
as
we
heard
the
damning
words
graham
alone
could
understand
them
and
our
hearts
were
filled
with
despair
say
now
o
king
if
these
men
of
ramos
do
not
justly
perish
continued
the
prince
with
a
voice
in
which
triumph
and
revenge
were
mingled
shall
they
go
free
who
spill
innocent
blood
yea
sully
a
woman
of
thy
peerless
race
and
she
thy
daughter
stung
to
madness
by
this
bitter
taunt
the
king
waved
his
hand
towards
the
speaker
and
in
a
stern
and
angry
voice
cried
out
peace
peace
perodii
thou
thyself
hath
fanned
our
wrath
in
proclaiming
thus
publicly
our
shame
and
i
bid
thee
retire
at
once
to
my
privy
chamber
whither
i
will
hold
consultation
with
thee
heed
well
thy
words
perodii
for
strongest
proof
of
what
thou
sayest
will
be
required
of
thee
then
addressing
the
officers
and
ministers
of
state
the
king
continued
let
these
four
men
of
ramos
be
taken
back
and
guarded
well
each
one
of
them
shall
die
their
blood
shall
wash
away
our
dishonour
three
days
hence
at
setting
of
the
sun
let
them
meet
their
doom
without
prayer
or
priest
and
be
consumed
with
their
handiwork
within
the
fiery
depths
of
melag
hurled
therein
from
the
crag
remagaloth
lead
them
hence
and
let
me
see
them
no
more
for
they
have
covered
me
with
humiliation
before
my
people
and
bowed
mine
aged
head
in
naked
shame
chapter
xiii
the
crag
remagaloth
the
sun
was
slowly
setting
blazing
in
a
hundred
hues
through
the
windows
and
filling
the
great
hall
with
a
mellow
glory
as
we
were
conducted
back
to
our
chamber
surrounded
by
an
escort
of
twenty
troopers
kaosp
led
the
way
we
could
see
that
his
heart
was
heavy
and
that
he
sympathised
with
us
in
our
great
trouble
we
were
weak
and
faint
from
want
of
food
the
reaction
had
come
after
the
excitement
of
the
day
and
not
one
of
us
spoke
to
the
other
as
we
walked
along
with
drooping
heads
and
faltering
steps
it
was
a
great
relief
to
escape
from
the
noisy
multitude
and
find
quietness
in
our
own
chamber
where
left
alone
in
our
sorrow
and
as
dying
men
we
could
rest
and
be
in
peace
there
seemed
no
mercy
whatever
for
us
not
the
remotest
chance
of
escape
from
the
horrid
doom
to
which
we
had
been
condemned
suicide
it
is
true
was
left
as
our
revolvers
were
still
hidden
in
our
pockets
for
it
was
a
remarkable
fact
that
no
one
had
shown
any
desire
to
search
us
since
we
had
been
made
prisoners
and
we
were
still
unwatched
and
yet
each
one
in
secret
still
hoped
to
escape
even
now
though
he
dared
not
to
breathe
his
thoughts
to
the
rest
had
we
not
three
days
what
could
we
not
do
in
them
oh
hope
when
does
man
really
abandon
thee
only
with
life
not
even
the
rejected
lover
the
ruined
gambler
or
the
man
who
faces
certain
death
to
the
last
we
all
of
us
cling
tightly
to
thee
pandora
priceless
gift
to
man
food
was
brought
to
us
almost
immediately
and
we
were
glad
to
see
that
kaosp
continued
at
his
post
as
commander
of
the
guard
be
ye
of
stout
heart
o
men
of
ramos
be
not
so
cast
down
at
misfortune
death
is
the
portion
of
us
all
and
mark
ye
the
king
may
yet
relent
his
anger
if
he
doth
but
see
perodii
perfidy
before
three
more
suns
have
set
said
kaosp
cheerfully
as
he
shook
us
by
the
hand
and
went
his
way
i
am
afraid
doctor
you
must
feel
very
bitterly
against
me
said
graham
as
we
sadly
ate
our
meal
both
you
and
temple
must
blame
me
for
all
this
misfortune
i
have
no
regrets
for
myself
but
it
is
sore
grief
indeed
to
see
you
fall
with
me
regrets
are
useless
now
graham
said
temple
besides
i
did
all
i
could
to
further
your
suit
with
volinè
for
i
believed
it
wise
to
do
so
i
do
not
blame
or
reproach
you
but
we
must
escape
when
or
how
i
know
not
but
graham
we
must
escape
ah
all
very
well
to
say
that
temple
but
we
are
too
well
guarded
and
too
closely
watched
we
had
best
sleep
on
the
matter
now
and
consult
together
in
the
morning
when
we
are
more
refreshed
graham
said
the
doctor
who
from
the
moment
the
king
had
pronounced
our
doom
had
not
spoken
graham
if
we
by
any
remote
possibility
escape
from
this
peril
take
my
advice
on
one
thing
leave
the
women
alone
for
the
future
i
am
older
than
you
have
had
more
experience
and
have
invariably
found
that
they
are
the
root
of
all
mischief
graham
answered
not
a
word
but
a
vision
of
volinè
in
all
her
splendid
beauty
rose
up
before
him
as
the
doctor
spoke
he
saw
her
as
she
nestled
in
his
arms
bashfully
confessing
her
love
for
him
in
that
garden
of
siccoth
and
in
his
heart
he
vowed
that
nothing
but
strong
death
itself
should
tear
them
asunder
the
hour
was
now
late
and
we
sought
to
drown
our
sorrow
in
slumber
sandy
had
already
gone
to
rest
and
lay
asleep
with
rover
for
his
pillow
the
nearness
of
death
did
not
seem
to
trouble
him
for
we
had
explained
to
him
the
king
last
words
of
doom
perhaps
our
many
escapes
from
great
peril
had
made
him
careless
of
danger
and
inspired
him
with
the
confidence
of
being
able
to
evade
his
enemies
strange
to
say
that
now
we
knew
our
fate
we
were
more
inclined
to
rest
and
speedily
we
sank
into
a
deep
slumber
thou
sleepest
heavily
o
man
of
ramos
even
with
death
beside
thee
whispered
kaosp
as
he
shook
graham
roughly
in
his
efforts
to
awaken
him
why
kaosp
where
what
seek
you
said
graham
starting
up
confused
from
sleep
hush
let
silence
keep
thy
tongue
thy
comrades
sleep
put
on
thy
garments
and
follow
me
volinè
would
see
thee
volinè
volinè
she
here
good
kaosp
conduct
me
to
her
quickly
how
can
i
repay
or
thank
you
for
such
a
boon
as
this
by
holding
thy
peace
i
hazard
honour
and
face
death
to
serve
thee
haste
thee
spend
not
thy
precious
fleeting
moments
in
catechising
me
for
she
whom
thou
lovest
awaits
thee
and
thy
time
is
short
in
but
an
hour
from
now
the
guard
is
changed
and
thou
must
be
back
again
i
dressed
in
silent
haste
and
followed
kaosp
through
the
larger
room
out
into
the
corridor
the
worthy
soldier
had
managed
well
for
not
a
guard
was
there
and
we
crept
along
until
i
felt
his
hand
tighten
on
my
arm
and
heard
him
whisper
thee
one
moment
for
i
would
assure
myself
that
all
is
safe
unfriendly
eyes
see
us
here
my
life
would
be
the
cost
he
listened
intently
for
a
moment
but
all
was
still
then
by
some
means
unknown
to
me
he
slid
back
a
panel
in
the
side
of
the
corridor
and
a
puff
of
cold
damp
air
rushed
into
our
faces
a
dark
yawning
gulf
was
before
me
and
i
drew
back
with
an
involuntary
shudder
but
kaosp
bid
me
enter
thee
down
these
steps
said
he
will
take
thee
to
a
passage
which
follow
until
thou
reachest
the
garden
of
and
there
volinè
awaits
thee
i
will
meet
thee
here
when
thou
returnest
but
heed
thee
well
the
fleeting
time
in
another
moment
kaosp
had
closed
the
panel
and
i
was
groping
my
way
down
the
steps
in
perfect
darkness
deep
steps
i
counted
and
then
i
came
to
a
passage
with
a
smooth
floor
which
i
walked
along
with
caution
feeling
the
walls
on
either
side
as
i
went
for
fifty
paces
i
walked
thus
the
damp
poisonous
air
choking
me
and
then
i
could
hear
the
playing
of
the
fountains
and
directly
afterwards
i
beheld
the
bright
stars
shimmering
before
me
i
waited
and
listened
for
a
few
seconds
before
venturing
from
the
passage
out
into
the
open
garden
but
with
the
exception
of
the
splashing
fountains
all
was
silent
as
death
then
i
walked
stealthily
onwards
with
eyes
striving
to
penetrate
the
gloom
now
on
this
side
now
on
that
and
seeking
to
discover
her
whom
i
loved
presently
i
saw
her
coming
towards
me
with
fleeting
steps
down
a
broad
pathway
between
the
shrubs
i
ran
to
meet
her
and
in
another
moment
we
were
clasped
in
each
other
arms
and
so
we
met
again
and
as
we
uttered
each
other
name
in
our
reunion
joy
i
rained
kiss
after
kiss
upon
her
soft
cheeks
and
willing
lips
and
the
hot
scalding
tears
of
grief
that
trickled
down
her
white
face
ploughed
as
with
molten
fire
across
my
own
oh
the
joy
and
yet
the
agony
of
that
midnight
tryst
we
had
met
yet
only
to
say
i
and
my
darling
were
to
love
no
more
in
life
for
in
three
fleeting
days
i
must
die
then
a
great
mad
thought
came
unto
me
and
i
planned
in
a
moment
of
time
that
volinè
and
i
would
flee
that
i
would
take
her
with
me
to
some
far
distant
place
where
we
could
live
and
love
without
fear
we
meet
once
more
but
our
lives
are
cloaked
with
sorrow
you
know
my
fate
it
is
your
royal
father
will
that
i
and
my
comrades
die
at
sunset
three
days
hence
death
is
dreadful
to
me
since
the
hour
i
saw
and
loved
you
i
who
have
met
this
grim
majestic
thing
called
death
in
a
hundred
shapes
without
fear
do
now
see
it
approach
with
craven
nerveless
terror
for
it
comes
to
part
me
from
you
dear
one
this
shall
not
be
let
us
haste
away
together
let
us
fly
from
edos
now
thou
sayest
that
which
is
impossible
which
can
not
be
she
sobbed
thou
not
that
every
way
from
siccoth
is
guarded
well
nay
doubly
guarded
since
i
prevailed
upon
the
king
my
father
to
let
thee
and
thy
companions
wander
therein
your
words
ring
like
knells
of
death
and
cold
despair
across
my
heart
then
give
not
such
freedom
to
despair
thou
knowest
i
love
thee
but
thou
must
not
show
a
woman
weakness
or
methinks
i
should
despise
thee
brave
men
know
not
fear
and
dangers
flee
affrighted
from
advancing
courage
she
answered
striving
to
excite
a
confidence
and
daring
she
by
no
means
felt
although
cunningly
concealing
her
fears
your
words
dear
one
have
robbed
all
sting
from
death
and
make
me
look
fearlessly
upon
my
doom
dear
thou
shalt
not
meet
it
the
ring
i
gave
thee
shall
deliver
thee
from
death
how
or
where
i
know
not
but
echri
ring
shall
save
thee
in
its
virtues
grows
stronger
and
stronger
within
my
heart
but
darling
the
moments
are
speeding
on
and
we
have
much
to
say
pray
tell
me
now
of
this
braggart
perodii
he
called
you
his
affianced
he
has
dared
to
use
your
name
as
a
synonym
for
shame
before
a
hundred
thousand
citizens
of
edos
and
his
lying
words
found
favour
with
your
father
speakest
truly
yet
heed
him
not
my
father
now
knows
that
i
would
rather
die
than
mate
with
him
prince
and
noble
though
he
be
i
have
braved
my
father
wrath
and
i
laughed
to
scorn
cowardly
blow
at
my
honour
because
i
love
thee
perodii
arms
have
never
held
me
thus
his
lips
have
never
met
my
own
when
he
calleth
me
his
he
lieth
harry
mark
thee
well
my
words
he
lieth
precious
one
i
whispered
words
are
as
strong
wine
unto
me
tell
me
also
what
your
father
says
concerning
us
and
of
our
discovery
by
perodii
near
the
arbour
wrath
she
continued
terrible
to
witness
and
i
quailed
before
his
bitter
words
i
told
him
but
the
truth
that
thou
hadst
found
favour
with
me
but
harry
that
ring
of
echri
shall
save
thee
although
my
father
and
his
soldiers
dare
to
defy
its
sacred
charms
so
long
as
that
ring
shall
circle
round
thy
finger
death
may
not
strike
thee
in
violence
therefore
guard
it
well
for
my
sake
as
well
as
thine
life
itself
for
ever
and
for
ever
i
whispered
in
her
ear
dear
one
it
seems
that
i
have
only
brought
pain
and
trouble
on
you
even
caused
your
precious
name
to
be
shrouded
in
dishonour
among
the
public
throng
estranged
your
father
from
you
now
after
all
you
sacrifice
for
me
our
happiness
is
turning
but
to
wormwood
and
to
gall
hadst
it
not
been
for
me
thy
comrades
and
thyself
would
now
be
free
for
kaosp
tells
me
the
king
was
in
a
pardoning
humour
until
perodii
spoke
but
the
sands
of
the
hour
are
nearly
run
and
it
is
time
for
thee
to
go
we
must
not
imperil
kaosp
by
tarrying
here
he
risketh
much
for
us
as
volinè
spoke
what
this
our
parting
really
meant
burst
upon
me
in
all
its
awful
nakedness
and
a
great
sigh
of
agony
escaped
unbidden
from
my
heart
the
hour
had
sped
and
we
must
part
in
all
human
probability
we
were
to
see
each
other
no
more
no
more
i
clasped
her
yet
more
tightly
to
me
and
felt
her
lovely
form
trembling
like
a
frightened
bird
in
my
embrace
her
bosom
heaved
in
sorrow
as
i
tenderly
kissed
her
tears
away
and
smoothed
her
yellow
tresses
which
like
a
web
of
spun
gold
hung
loose
and
careless
over
my
arm
for
a
few
brief
moments
thus
together
in
silence
and
then
as
i
kissed
her
once
more
she
broke
gently
from
my
embrace
and
in
sorrow
walked
slowly
away
turning
round
as
she
did
so
and
sobbing
said
a
stout
heart
dear
harry
my
prayers
are
said
for
thee
for
i
am
all
thine
own
remember
echri
ring
and
fare
thee
well
beloved
fare
thee
well
she
was
gone
and
i
with
arms
stretched
out
in
entreaty
towards
her
stood
desolate
and
alone
in
my
sore
despair
for
several
moments
i
stood
as
though
turned
to
stone
calling
her
name
in
the
empty
garden
and
repeating
aloud
those
touching
words
of
byron
thee
well
and
if
for
ever
still
for
ever
fare
thee
well
but
only
the
stars
and
the
trees
and
the
fountains
heard
me
she
whom
i
addressed
was
gone
like
some
fair
meteor
she
had
rushed
across
my
path
dazzled
and
attracted
me
during
her
fleeting
stay
beyond
all
power
of
resistance
and
then
as
suddenly
vanished
from
me
and
left
me
in
a
chaos
of
misery
and
sorrow
god
in
his
mercy
to
me
blot
out
from
my
memory
the
agony
of
this
parting
in
the
garden
of
siccoth
for
i
can
never
know
happiness
again
so
long
as
its
terrors
haunt
me
i
prayed
aloud
in
my
woe
with
face
turned
upwards
to
the
starlit
sky
how
i
got
back
to
the
archway
and
crept
along
the
passage
and
up
the
steps
to
the
sliding
panel
i
know
not
for
i
went
my
way
as
one
in
a
walking
sleep
with
all
strength
sapped
from
my
trembling
frame
kaosp
was
awaiting
my
return
in
great
anxiety
for
the
hour
was
already
gone
and
every
moment
he
dreaded
to
hear
the
tramp
of
the
guard
coming
to
relieve
him
and
his
men
silent
and
follow
me
with
haste
he
whispered
too
late
i
shall
repent
me
of
lending
willing
ears
to
a
woman
supplications
by
great
good
fortune
the
guard
is
late
or
this
night
work
would
be
known
to
my
ruin
am
really
sorry
kaosp
that
i
have
rewarded
your
good
nature
by
jeopardizing
your
safety
and
your
honour
but
the
hour
has
seemed
so
short
is
always
so
lovers
heed
not
time
but
the
hour
with
me
hath
seemed
an
age
we
walked
stealthily
back
again
not
meeting
a
living
soul
and
i
crept
to
my
couch
without
waking
one
of
my
comrades
they
all
slept
on
in
ignorance
and
i
resolved
to
keep
my
own
counsel
the
episode
was
too
sacred
and
too
painful
to
take
anyone
into
my
confidence
besides
no
purpose
would
be
gained
and
i
had
nought
to
tell
that
would
be
of
service
in
our
dire
necessity
kaosp
shook
me
by
the
hand
before
he
departed
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
as
i
lay
awake
in
my
misery
thinking
of
all
that
had
taken
place
within
the
past
hour
i
heard
the
new
guard
arrive
and
station
themselves
in
the
corridor
beside
the
outer
door
it
is
unnecessary
for
the
purposes
of
this
narrative
to
record
our
doings
during
the
three
days
of
grace
that
were
allowed
us
we
neither
saw
or
heard
anything
of
the
king
volinè
or
perodii
we
were
entirely
shut
off
from
all
outside
affairs
and
we
knew
nothing
of
what
was
being
done
either
in
the
palace
or
among
the
people
of
edos
we
were
treated
precisely
the
same
as
before
our
trial
with
the
exception
of
being
allowed
to
walk
in
the
garden
of
siccoth
that
privilege
was
denied
and
we
were
kept
close
prisoners
to
our
rooms
two
things
occurred
however
which
call
for
special
notice
the
first
was
the
withdrawal
of
kaosp
and
his
men
he
and
they
being
replaced
by
an
entirely
new
set
of
guards
the
reason
we
could
not
discover
we
sorely
missed
our
old
friend
and
his
cheerful
ways
and
graham
at
least
had
some
misgivings
at
his
absence
had
kaosp
breach
of
trust
in
aiding
volinè
and
himself
to
meet
after
the
trial
become
known
and
his
treachery
punished
we
could
not
get
any
information
from
our
new
warders
each
one
of
them
maintained
a
stolid
silence
and
never
addressed
a
single
word
to
either
of
us
during
those
three
dreadful
days
of
suspense
the
second
thing
worthy
of
mention
was
the
fact
that
we
were
now
watched
day
and
night
incessantly
there
were
always
two
guards
with
us
and
every
movement
on
our
part
was
closely
observed
but
in
spite
of
all
this
extra
precaution
we
were
never
searched
and
our
little
personal
belongings
remained
untouched
wearily
the
days
passed
on
and
we
were
filled
with
an
agony
of
suspense
as
our
last
few
hours
of
life
ebbed
slowly
yet
surely
away
not
one
of
us
appeared
fully
to
realise
the
awfulness
of
our
impending
fate
for
each
in
secret
was
buoyed
up
with
the
hope
that
our
doom
by
some
means
would
be
averted
we
hoped
and
hoped
as
the
time
slipped
on
yet
nothing
occurred
to
warrant
even
the
remotest
thought
that
we
should
be
saved
as
usual
the
doctor
was
most
cheerful
temple
and
sandy
were
becoming
exceedingly
cast
down
graham
had
secret
faith
in
volinè
and
her
mystic
ring
which
he
still
wore
upon
his
finger
the
fatal
day
dawned
at
last
but
our
guards
exhibited
precisely
the
same
stolid
demeanour
and
breakfast
was
served
to
us
as
usual
we
ate
little
but
drank
deeply
of
a
liquor
somewhat
resembling
still
hock
the
effects
of
which
were
exceedingly
stimulating
and
comforting
we
had
only
had
this
wine
at
our
noonday
meals
before
and
we
concluded
that
our
captors
had
been
kind
enough
to
furnish
us
with
this
liquor
to
brace
us
for
the
coming
ordeal
at
sunset
we
little
suspected
that
the
wine
was
drugged
and
had
been
given
to
us
for
a
purpose
half
an
hour
after
the
meal
was
over
each
one
of
us
felt
a
sickly
stupor
creeping
over
him
numbing
his
sense
of
feeling
and
in
subtle
sureness
robbing
him
of
all
use
of
his
limbs
the
early
effects
of
the
poison
were
by
no
means
unpleasant
we
were
filled
with
a
luxurious
languor
a
delicious
feeling
of
rest
of
freedom
from
anxiety
came
over
us
but
soon
the
poison
had
other
effects
and
we
became
speechless
the
brain
seemed
a
mass
of
molten
fire
we
appeared
to
be
swelling
into
absolute
giants
everything
around
us
grew
distorted
and
every
muscle
seemed
to
become
scorched
and
withered
until
we
sank
into
a
complete
state
of
coma
from
this
moment
we
remembered
no
more
until
we
were
awoke
by
a
cool
fresh
wind
blowing
on
our
faces
and
a
hum
and
roar
like
that
from
some
excited
multitude
dinning
as
distant
thunder
in
our
ears
we
tried
to
rise
but
in
vain
for
every
limb
was
draped
in
brass
chains
and
we
were
bound
and
helpless
in
the
hands
of
our
remorseless
enemies
graham
and
sandy
recovered
quickly
from
the
effects
of
the
drug
when
once
we
regained
consciousness
but
we
must
have
lain
for
many
hours
in
a
helpless
state
of
stupor
we
found
ourselves
in
a
tent
the
entrance
to
which
was
folded
back
but
only
the
sky
was
visible
and
this
was
hidden
every
few
moments
as
the
giant
form
of
a
soldier
passed
to
and
fro
on
guard
outside
curses
on
the
refinement
of
their
cruelty
said
graham
as
he
looked
round
at
his
helpless
comrades
and
felt
the
brass
fetters
on
his
own
legs
and
wrists
damn
their
cunning
why
could
not
they
lead
us
out
like
men
upon
my
soul
it
something
to
be
proud
o
they
must
ha
feared
us
or
they
wouldna
ha
done
this
graham
said
sandy
in
rage
temple
and
the
doctor
did
not
speak
the
drug
seemed
to
have
blunted
all
their
powers
of
perception
and
they
lay
helpless
and
still
as
in
a
waking
dream
if
we
could
only
break
these
graham
we
would
at
least
die
fighting
and
show
the
incarnate
devils
that
we
dinna
fear
death
said
sandy
as
he
tore
savagely
at
his
chains
but
strong
man
as
he
was
their
polished
links
only
clanged
and
jingled
in
mockery
it
no
good
sandy
graham
answered
these
brass
chains
were
made
to
hold
stronger
men
than
you
or
i
men
of
ramos
the
sun
is
setting
and
the
hour
approaches
when
ye
must
die
said
an
officer
as
he
pushed
the
still
wider
open
and
walked
towards
us
followed
by
soldiers
troopers
he
continued
strike
off
the
fetters
from
their
feet
and
bring
these
prisoners
forth
our
feet
and
legs
were
soon
set
free
and
we
were
bidden
to
rise
graham
and
sandy
were
on
their
feet
directly
but
when
the
doctor
and
temple
tried
to
stand
up
they
reeled
like
drunken
men
and
had
to
be
assisted
out
of
the
tent
by
the
guards
one
by
one
we
passed
through
the
doorway
out
into
the
open
air
were
we
still
unconscious
were
we
still
under
the
influence
of
a
subtle
poison
what
wondrous
magic
what
enchantment
was
this
edos
the
palace
the
gardens
of
siccoth
all
had
changed
as
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
to
us
and
we
found
ourselves
transported
to
the
midst
of
a
savage
wilderness
how
we
had
come
hither
we
knew
not
whilst
drugged
and
helpless
and
unconscious
we
had
been
borne
to
this
terrible
place
to
die
we
stood
on
a
steep
rugged
hillside
some
twenty
yards
or
so
from
the
summit
below
us
was
a
vast
multitude
of
people
congregated
in
the
form
of
a
horseshoe
round
the
mountain
around
us
was
a
cordon
of
soldiers
whilst
at
the
very
top
of
the
mountain
we
saw
the
how
or
when
conveyed
thither
we
knew
not
escape
seemed
utterly
hopeless
and
for
the
first
time
we
realized
that
we
were
really
about
to
die
the
wild
grandeur
of
that
sunset
scene
can
never
fade
from
our
memory
all
round
us
were
mountains
whose
rugged
peaks
were
illuminated
by
the
rays
of
the
sinking
sun
the
snow
gleaming
on
some
of
them
like
sheets
of
polished
silver
a
volcano
with
a
thin
wreath
of
blue
smoke
curling
gently
skywards
crowned
the
sides
of
the
distant
valley
and
the
ground
all
round
us
and
as
far
as
we
could
see
below
us
was
strewn
with
fantastic
shaped
boulders
and
masses
of
rock
but
not
a
trace
of
vegetation
could
be
seen
amongst
them
everything
was
desolate
in
that
vale
of
bitterness
and
death
hideous
the
doom
that
condemned
this
strange
place
to
barrenness
and
ruin
the
face
of
the
mountain
was
scarred
and
furrowed
as
with
a
vast
despair
and
the
grey
ghostly
plain
below
seemed
full
of
a
horrid
phantasm
no
streams
of
water
trickled
down
the
hillsides
not
a
living
thing
was
nourished
by
the
barren
fruitless
soil
beyond
the
summit
at
a
much
higher
elevation
hung
a
vast
bank
of
gloomy
vapour
like
a
bitter
teardrop
on
the
face
of
the
desert
wilderness
its
surface
gleaming
in
gold
and
frowning
in
grey
as
the
lights
and
shadows
played
upon
its
constantly
changing
surface
illustration
the
sirius
boldly
outlined
against
the
sky
as
soon
as
we
had
all
got
out
of
the
tent
we
were
conducted
up
the
towards
the
which
stood
boldly
outlined
against
the
sky
at
the
summit
when
we
got
to
the
top
the
scene
was
even
more
awful
enough
to
curdle
the
blood
of
the
with
horror
we
stood
upon
the
crag
remagaloth
a
jutting
rock
which
arched
and
overhung
in
awful
grandeur
a
vast
lake
of
seething
molten
fire
five
thousand
feet
below
in
one
clear
terrible
plunge
the
cruel
cliffs
dipped
down
to
this
lake
of
flame
and
on
the
brink
of
that
rugged
crag
jutting
out
like
an
index
finger
above
the
gulf
was
the
looking
as
if
the
slightest
touch
would
overbalance
her
and
hurl
her
downwards
into
the
fiery
depths
the
surface
of
this
molten
lake
was
remarkably
still
here
and
there
a
tongue
of
flame
shot
upwards
and
then
sank
again
here
and
there
the
seething
mass
heaved
gently
as
though
simmering
and
swelling
in
sullen
rage
the
reflection
lit
up
the
surrounding
rocks
and
gleamed
upon
the
armour
and
the
faces
of
the
troops
making
them
look
like
fiends
in
human
guise
what
words
can
describe
our
feelings
as
we
stood
chained
and
helpless
on
the
brink
of
melag
awaiting
our
hideous
doom
the
sun
already
was
below
the
behind
us
in
the
distant
west
and
the
plain
of
desolation
below
was
fast
cloaking
its
horrors
in
the
gloom
of
night
earth
shone
as
a
pale
star
in
the
clear
sky
and
our
eyes
looked
out
with
yearning
love
across
the
realms
of
space
towards
her
our
home
alas
home
no
more
in
a
few
more
fleeting
moments
all
would
be
over
we
thought
with
horror
of
the
death
before
us
of
the
actual
time
when
the
after
falling
five
thousand
feet
like
a
winged
and
helpless
bird
would
strike
with
a
dull
gurgling
sound
the
molten
lake
below
and
then
of
what
we
should
experience
in
that
one
brief
dreadful
moment
between
life
and
death
when
the
ocean
of
living
fire
should
surge
over
us
in
its
pitiless
embrace
we
had
little
time
for
thought
however
for
almost
directly
we
reached
the
jutting
crag
the
same
commander
stepped
forward
and
said
men
of
ramos
it
is
here
that
by
the
king
commands
ye
are
to
die
it
is
his
royal
will
that
this
strange
carriage
in
which
ye
came
to
gathma
shall
be
consumed
with
ye
so
that
ye
and
your
evil
works
may
be
entirely
destroyed
as
he
spoke
a
loud
tumultuous
shout
of
approbation
rose
from
the
assembled
hosts
below
us
and
then
a
silence
as
of
death
came
over
the
expectant
throng
as
they
watched
in
breathless
excitement
the
closing
scene
of
this
awful
execution
once
more
our
feet
were
chained
so
that
we
were
utterly
helpless
not
one
of
us
spoke
as
we
were
assisted
up
the
ladder
into
the
as
we
entered
one
by
one
we
noticed
a
score
or
more
stalwart
troopers
standing
round
evidently
waiting
for
the
signal
to
hurl
us
over
into
the
lake
as
soon
as
all
was
prepared
sandy
and
his
dog
were
taken
first
then
graham
then
temple
and
last
of
all
the
doctor
as
graham
was
going
up
the
ladder
perodii
stepped
forward
we
had
not
noticed
him
before
but
he
had
come
to
see
the
death
of
his
rival
and
to
mock
and
triumph
over
him
in
his
helpless
agony
see
thou
boasting
fool
volinè
hath
deserted
thee
in
thy
hour
of
need
she
comes
not
to
see
thee
enter
eternal
fire
her
shame
is
deeper
than
her
love
and
even
her
magic
ring
can
not
help
thee
now
that
silly
echri
and
his
wondrous
magic
are
impotent
before
a
few
brass
chains
and
stalwart
troopers
coward
breathe
not
her
dear
name
to
me
and
keep
your
blasphemy
for
those
who
may
appreciate
it
were
but
my
fetters
loose
i
would
make
carrion
of
your
carcase
and
i
die
breathing
curses
on
your
lying
tongue
graham
answered
with
wonderful
coolness
begone
leap
thee
into
hell
and
take
thy
punishment
for
meddling
with
things
that
concerned
thee
not
perodii
continued
unable
to
conceal
his
mortification
at
his
vain
effort
to
rouse
graham
into
a
display
of
open
anger
graham
was
stung
to
madness
by
perodii
bitter
taunts
and
as
soon
as
he
got
inside
the
he
tore
at
his
chains
like
one
possessed
the
muscles
of
his
arms
swelled
out
like
knotted
ropes
and
the
veins
on
his
hands
seemed
about
to
burst
as
he
wrestled
with
the
strong
brass
fetters
his
strength
seemed
supernatural
and
at
last
with
a
mighty
wrench
he
snapped
the
links
asunder
and
with
a
cry
of
joy
rushed
down
to
the
already
we
heard
the
signal
being
given
the
was
toppling
over
but
instead
of
falling
the
motors
sped
round
and
we
rose
upwards
towards
the
clouds
triumphant
over
our
enemies
a
terrible
cry
of
rage
and
disappointment
came
from
the
spectators
in
his
excitement
graham
forgot
his
manacled
companions
and
hurried
out
on
to
the
balcony
to
taunt
the
baffled
crowd
below
as
the
slowly
mounted
through
the
air
a
shout
rose
up
from
the
cowed
and
frightened
soldiers
it
is
echri
magic
ring
that
hath
worked
this
marvel
and
delivered
these
men
of
ramos
out
of
our
hands
woe
woe
unto
us
for
defying
him
we
shall
meet
again
perodii
shouted
graham
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
when
we
do
i
make
you
answer
to
me
for
all
the
evil
you
have
wrought
the
voices
of
the
crowd
were
now
only
as
a
distant
murmur
and
soon
after
we
were
too
far
away
to
hear
any
sounds
at
all
graham
soon
found
tools
and
released
us
from
our
fetters
thank
god
for
once
again
delivering
us
from
peril
said
temple
reverently
the
ring
the
ring
you
all
despised
and
scoffed
at
has
saved
us
said
graham
for
the
hand
which
carried
it
found
more
than
a
strength
call
it
superstition
if
you
will
but
i
solemnly
swear
that
my
unaided
strength
was
not
equal
to
those
chains
the
best
thing
to
do
said
the
doctor
slowly
and
with
some
impatience
in
his
voice
for
he
was
yet
feeling
dazed
and
weak
is
to
settle
where
we
are
going
i
am
certain
the
can
not
carry
us
three
hundred
miles
let
us
put
as
much
distance
as
possible
between
edos
and
ourselves
temple
suggested
very
true
temple
but
unfortunately
we
know
not
in
which
direction
edos
lies
the
doctor
answered
and
so
we
sped
on
we
knew
not
whither
but
keeping
a
sharp
our
course
was
nearly
due
north
a
point
or
so
east
the
country
so
far
as
we
could
judge
in
the
deepening
gloom
was
forbidding
in
appearance
and
the
reflection
from
the
lake
of
molten
fire
shone
on
the
heavens
for
a
vast
distance
we
seemed
to
have
left
all
fertile
lands
behind
us
and
were
hastening
into
regions
of
desert
barrenness
two
hours
after
our
escape
from
remagaloth
our
stock
of
electricity
showed
signs
of
becoming
exhausted
we
had
not
the
wherewithal
to
generate
more
we
were
now
quite
two
hundred
miles
away
to
the
of
the
and
here
we
were
compelled
to
descend
we
dropped
gently
down
on
what
seemed
to
be
a
vast
plain
barren
of
vegetation
and
there
safe
in
the
we
ate
a
hearty
meal
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
a
cigar
and
went
to
sleep
all
eager
for
the
dawn
to
disclose
to
us
the
nature
of
the
country
we
had
entered
chapter
xiv
across
the
desert
chados
we
awoke
at
dawn
feeling
like
new
men
scarcely
being
able
to
realise
the
fact
that
we
were
free
the
events
of
yesterday
still
lingered
in
our
minds
like
the
remnants
of
a
more
than
usually
vivid
dream
that
all
was
real
and
true
we
could
not
bring
ourselves
to
believe
so
awful
and
inhuman
seemed
the
doom
we
had
so
miraculously
escaped
but
the
sun
as
it
rose
in
solemn
splendour
above
the
eastern
edge
of
this
strange
world
soon
dispelled
our
morbid
thoughts
and
cheered
us
into
activity
the
view
from
the
balcony
of
the
was
grand
though
the
country
round
us
was
sterile
and
desolate
as
the
valley
of
death
below
remagaloth
from
which
we
had
been
delivered
at
yester
but
we
had
life
and
liberty
the
future
was
once
more
before
us
full
of
hopes
and
possibilities
and
each
one
felt
that
the
worst
was
over
and
brighter
prospects
were
now
before
us
we
found
everything
in
the
precisely
as
we
had
left
it
evidently
the
people
of
edos
had
shunned
our
carriage
and
desired
that
we
and
all
our
belongings
might
be
destroyed
together
this
was
a
fortunate
circumstance
for
us
for
had
the
been
dismantled
and
pillaged
we
should
have
been
in
this
wilderness
without
food
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
we
consulted
together
as
to
what
was
best
to
be
done
there
is
no
help
for
it
my
friends
said
the
doctor
the
is
wrecked
and
we
shall
have
to
leave
her
to
her
fate
alas
she
can
give
us
safety
no
longer
and
we
may
stay
in
her
at
our
peril
we
may
be
sure
a
search
will
be
made
for
us
and
that
very
quickly
our
only
course
is
to
abandon
her
taking
with
us
as
many
absolute
necessaries
as
we
can
conveniently
carry
among
us
and
set
off
at
once
towards
more
fertile
country
the
future
must
take
care
of
itself
entirely
and
we
be
guided
further
solely
by
circumstances
but
doctor
is
there
no
hope
of
patching
her
up
for
a
little
time
longer
none
graham
our
motors
are
worn
out
our
generating
material
exhausted
we
should
require
all
the
resources
of
a
civilised
community
to
make
good
her
defects
and
replenish
her
power
then
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
do
as
you
suggest
doctor
said
temple
and
graham
reluctantly
acquiesced
while
the
doctor
and
sandy
selected
such
articles
as
we
were
going
to
take
temple
and
graham
went
outside
to
reconnoitre
and
to
decide
as
to
the
best
route
we
should
take
there
was
little
choice
to
be
made
radiating
in
every
direction
from
where
we
stood
the
wide
desert
extended
in
one
vast
scene
of
ruinous
waste
we
stood
on
a
wide
uneven
and
plain
which
reached
to
the
horizon
on
every
side
not
a
trace
of
vegetation
could
we
detect
sprouting
from
the
bitter
ungenerous
soil
not
a
stream
or
a
pool
cheered
its
wide
expanse
all
round
the
horizon
were
mountains
of
bare
and
forbidding
aspect
some
of
them
crested
with
what
looked
like
snow
others
volcanic
and
belching
smoke
and
fire
the
route
toward
the
seemed
the
most
feasible
for
in
that
direction
the
mountains
were
not
so
high
and
an
apparent
break
in
the
rocky
girdle
suggested
an
easier
passage
over
them
it
must
be
temple
we
ought
to
reach
the
mountains
by
afternoon
and
get
through
yonder
pass
to
the
country
beyond
them
by
evening
of
the
next
day
at
latest
i
think
so
too
said
temple
and
now
that
is
decided
let
me
take
the
opportunity
of
our
few
moments
alone
together
sincerely
to
thank
you
for
our
deliverance
from
death
yesterday
you
have
saved
my
life
graham
and
anything
that
i
can
do
in
return
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
i
have
not
cared
to
speak
thus
to
you
before
the
doctor
as
i
know
the
subject
is
distasteful
to
him
whenever
a
woman
is
concerned
no
matter
how
remotely
all
his
and
generosity
vanish
he
absolutely
hates
women
and
all
to
do
with
them
pray
temple
do
not
thank
me
i
was
but
the
agent
of
our
deliverance
after
all
thank
this
wonderful
priest
echri
for
it
was
he
who
saved
us
through
volinè
mystic
ring
why
or
how
we
know
not
yet
i
am
as
sure
of
it
as
i
am
of
my
own
existence
i
can
not
expect
you
and
the
rest
to
be
so
credulous
as
to
believe
in
its
virtues
he
continued
looking
at
the
ring
and
twirling
it
round
his
finger
as
he
spoke
but
the
feelings
that
came
over
me
when
i
broke
those
fetters
yesternight
can
never
be
expressed
in
words
ask
me
not
to
attempt
to
describe
them
for
i
desire
to
keep
what
i
then
felt
a
sacred
secret
but
talking
of
volinè
graham
i
am
really
very
sorry
for
you
it
recalls
my
own
young
days
when
i
wooed
and
won
the
charming
girl
who
became
my
wife
but
only
to
die
with
her
infant
son
in
twelve
short
fleeting
months
and
to
leave
me
in
lonely
sorrow
i
have
not
got
over
that
trouble
graham
and
i
never
shall
twenty
years
old
though
it
is
then
temple
you
can
slightly
understand
my
infatuation
my
sincere
love
for
this
girl
of
gathma
is
she
not
worthy
of
all
the
love
that
man
can
give
she
is
as
good
and
as
true
as
she
is
handsome
and
yet
all
now
is
over
between
us
all
is
over
and
i
shall
see
her
no
more
but
you
must
cheer
up
do
let
the
doctor
see
your
weakness
for
it
will
only
make
unpleasantness
amongst
us
things
may
come
right
yet
you
know
the
old
about
all
things
coming
to
him
who
waits
something
tells
me
that
even
now
we
have
not
seen
the
last
of
edos
or
of
the
king
of
gathma
daughter
that
you
may
be
a
true
prophet
then
is
my
one
prayer
for
i
love
volinè
and
without
her
my
life
is
dreary
and
desolate
as
this
desert
around
us
well
graham
we
had
better
get
back
to
the
now
i
daresay
the
doctor
is
ready
to
start
by
this
time
and
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
let
the
subject
of
volinè
and
all
that
happened
in
edos
form
no
part
of
our
conversation
the
doctor
has
strange
ideas
what
man
of
genius
has
not
and
at
present
it
is
best
to
humour
him
for
we
require
all
his
undivided
energies
to
bring
us
safely
through
our
perils
so
conversing
temple
and
graham
walked
back
towards
the
where
we
found
the
doctor
and
sandy
had
arranged
into
four
packs
the
various
necessaries
he
had
selected
from
the
stores
well
friends
what
is
the
result
of
your
exploration
said
the
doctor
smiling
and
looking
up
from
one
of
the
packages
he
was
strapping
together
travelling
will
be
slow
doctor
answered
graham
for
the
ground
is
covered
with
loose
sand
and
rough
broken
rock
our
best
course
is
towards
the
rent
or
defile
in
the
mountains
yonder
we
should
reach
them
by
afternoon
then
take
a
cup
of
this
meat
essence
and
we
will
be
off
said
the
doctor
i
think
we
have
got
all
that
we
shall
require
for
immediate
use
water
will
be
scarce
but
i
think
we
have
a
substitute
now
have
a
last
look
round
and
satisfy
yourselves
that
you
are
leaving
nothing
you
may
value
specially
behind
at
last
we
each
shouldered
our
package
strapping
it
on
our
back
like
a
knapsack
and
with
rifle
in
hand
we
turned
from
the
and
began
our
march
tears
dimmed
the
doctor
eyes
as
he
looked
for
the
last
time
upon
his
cherished
handiwork
every
bolt
and
plate
of
which
was
dear
to
him
and
not
one
of
us
left
the
good
carriage
without
feelings
of
regret
for
it
seemed
as
though
we
were
turning
our
backs
on
home
hour
after
hour
we
trudged
along
now
sinking
in
fine
sand
then
slipping
and
stumbling
as
we
slowly
picked
our
way
across
stony
ground
the
sun
beating
down
upon
us
from
a
clear
and
rainless
sky
after
exerting
ourselves
to
the
very
utmost
we
found
that
we
had
not
advanced
more
than
twelve
miles
from
the
by
and
owing
to
the
extreme
clearness
of
the
heated
atmosphere
this
distance
did
not
appear
much
more
than
six
we
halted
to
rest
under
the
shadow
of
a
big
mass
of
rock
which
lay
embedded
in
the
sand
and
here
we
ate
our
food
and
each
drank
a
cup
of
wine
and
water
from
his
flask
of
pure
water
we
had
only
one
small
cask
holding
a
gallon
which
sandy
carried
slung
from
his
shoulder
this
we
reserved
for
any
emergency
but
we
hoped
to
find
a
stream
or
pool
before
nightfall
we
allowed
ourselves
one
hour
rest
then
resumed
our
march
and
continued
struggling
on
till
sunset
during
the
afternoon
we
crossed
a
stretch
of
better
ground
and
by
the
time
we
halted
for
the
night
we
seemed
to
have
done
at
least
half
the
distance
that
separated
the
from
the
mountains
we
encamped
in
a
rocky
hollow
tent
or
fire
we
had
none
we
could
not
carry
the
one
and
no
materials
for
the
other
were
to
be
got
in
this
wilderness
we
ate
our
cold
supper
and
then
fell
asleep
with
nothing
but
the
starry
sky
above
us
and
with
the
soft
sand
for
our
beds
it
was
a
lovely
night
warm
and
windless
and
still
so
that
we
experienced
little
or
no
discomfort
and
awoke
refreshed
just
as
the
rising
sun
was
tipping
the
distant
hills
with
gold
not
one
drop
of
water
not
the
slightest
sign
of
moisture
had
we
discovered
and
the
night
had
been
dry
and
dewless
not
a
blade
of
vegetation
or
a
trace
of
any
living
thing
could
yet
be
seen
was
desert
and
barren
with
no
fire
to
warm
or
cook
anything
our
morning
meal
was
not
quite
so
savoury
as
it
might
have
been
but
we
were
hungry
and
hungry
men
are
rarely
fastidious
meat
essence
dissolved
in
a
little
water
with
biscuits
and
a
draught
of
watered
wine
formed
our
repast
and
as
soon
as
it
was
done
we
picked
up
our
belongings
and
made
an
early
start
we
were
anxious
to
get
as
much
ground
covered
as
possible
before
the
sun
became
so
oppressively
powerful
besides
death
stared
us
in
the
face
on
every
side
in
this
terrible
wilderness
and
delay
might
prove
fatal
to
us
all
slowly
terribly
slowly
mile
after
mile
was
passed
and
the
mountains
before
us
began
to
show
out
in
more
detail
they
were
barren
and
sterile
enough
everything
seemed
withered
and
blasted
and
the
sun
in
fierce
splendour
travelled
across
the
waterless
heavens
and
burnt
into
the
bare
rocks
and
sands
wasting
his
heat
on
a
region
of
eternal
desolation
by
we
were
so
fatigued
that
we
sank
down
beside
a
big
stone
to
rest
our
weary
limbs
and
throbbing
heads
eat
we
could
not
our
mouths
were
dry
and
parched
and
we
craved
for
water
there
was
but
a
quart
of
the
precious
fluid
left
a
quart
of
lukewarm
water
between
four
thirsty
men
and
a
panting
dog
sandy
begged
hard
for
a
drop
for
his
dog
and
he
moistened
poor
mouth
with
a
spoonful
but
we
ourselves
tried
to
slake
our
awful
thirst
with
a
few
of
the
doctor
lozenges
they
answered
admirably
but
their
effect
was
only
momentary
and
by
the
time
each
little
cake
was
sucked
away
we
were
as
thirsty
as
before
the
sun
beat
down
upon
us
remorselessly
and
to
save
ourselves
from
being
scorched
to
death
we
scraped
a
hole
under
the
shadow
of
the
stone
and
there
huddled
together
in
the
scanty
shade
we
lay
waiting
for
the
sun
to
sink
lower
in
the
west
before
we
tried
to
drag
our
weary
feet
a
little
farther
for
three
hours
we
remained
in
this
hole
in
the
sand
then
once
more
we
started
on
moistening
our
mouths
from
our
nearly
empty
flasks
and
munching
a
biscuit
as
we
went
towards
night
the
temperature
became
much
lower
and
we
were
able
to
get
along
a
little
faster
but
every
mile
that
we
went
we
found
our
burdens
becoming
heavier
yet
we
struggled
on
nor
did
we
seek
a
until
we
reached
the
lower
slopes
of
the
mountains
still
all
was
desolation
closer
scrutiny
only
confirmed
the
opinions
formed
by
a
more
distant
view
for
the
hills
were
as
sterile
and
barren
as
the
plain
we
had
crossed
never
mind
my
friends
said
the
doctor
we
have
crossed
the
worst
part
here
amid
the
mountains
we
are
sure
of
more
shade
and
shall
most
probably
find
water
if
not
on
these
slopes
surely
on
the
other
side
well
doctor
if
we
do
find
water
soon
it
will
be
all
over
with
us
remarked
temple
i
myself
do
feel
equal
to
another
day
like
this
has
been
none
of
us
know
the
compass
of
our
strength
or
what
we
can
do
until
spurred
on
by
the
goads
of
necessity
temple
the
doctor
answered
we
selected
a
sheltered
nook
among
the
rocks
each
smoothing
the
sand
into
the
semblance
of
a
couch
and
there
we
used
the
remainder
of
the
water
to
make
our
essence
and
then
stretching
our
stiff
and
weary
limbs
soon
fell
asleep
not
one
of
us
awoke
again
until
the
next
day
was
far
advanced
the
sun
was
four
hours
high
towards
the
zenith
ere
we
roused
from
our
slumber
the
long
sleep
had
done
us
good
our
heads
were
easier
our
thirst
not
so
intense
we
drank
the
remainder
of
our
wine
and
water
ate
a
few
biscuits
and
then
prepared
for
our
onward
march
the
rocky
pass
between
two
rugged
mountains
lay
straight
before
us
and
in
single
file
we
went
our
way
at
first
the
precipitous
sides
of
the
mountains
nearly
met
overhead
and
the
path
was
little
more
than
a
gloomy
fissure
but
this
soon
widened
out
as
we
ascended
and
we
eventually
found
ourselves
in
a
broad
valley
with
an
uninterrupted
view
for
miles
our
great
exertions
in
walking
over
the
ground
soon
began
to
create
acute
thirst
we
had
no
fluid
now
of
any
kind
and
only
a
dozen
lozenges
were
left
these
we
shared
three
to
each
and
very
soon
the
cravings
for
moisture
triumphed
and
they
were
gone
we
had
nothing
whatever
now
to
assuage
thirst
we
must
find
water
or
die
times
without
number
we
consulted
together
as
to
the
propriety
of
throwing
away
our
arms
and
ammunition
but
still
we
continued
to
carry
them
first
in
one
hand
then
in
the
other
then
one
or
the
other
of
us
said
he
could
go
no
farther
and
begged
the
rest
to
leave
him
to
die
in
peace
but
we
cheered
and
rallied
him
whose
hopes
of
deliverance
were
ebbing
as
best
we
could
and
still
toiled
on
upwards
onwards
filled
with
all
the
torments
of
a
raging
thirst
we
toiled
our
feet
heavy
as
though
shod
with
lead
but
still
no
sign
of
life
the
same
desolate
wilderness
the
same
hot
sun
the
same
bare
rocks
and
stony
way
continuing
on
and
on
apparently
to
eternity
all
that
livelong
day
we
struggled
on
beneath
a
scorching
sun
towards
evening
we
were
startled
by
a
shout
from
sandy
the
water
doctor
the
shining
water
see
there
there
below
ye
on
the
left
we
looked
where
sandy
pointed
and
there
could
we
trust
our
eyes
or
was
it
but
the
fancy
of
a
scorched
and
brain
there
about
a
mile
away
was
a
beautiful
pool
below
the
hillside
its
shimmering
waters
glistening
like
silver
in
the
setting
sun
we
literally
danced
for
joy
and
nerved
to
new
strength
by
the
sight
of
the
welcome
waters
we
ran
over
the
rocks
and
stones
towards
them
when
two
hundred
yards
away
we
threw
down
our
rifles
and
slipped
out
of
the
straps
that
held
our
burdens
and
each
raced
as
for
his
life
to
be
the
first
to
revel
in
the
feast
graham
being
by
far
the
strongest
reached
the
brink
first
but
instead
of
kneeling
down
to
quench
his
thirst
he
threw
himself
to
the
ground
with
a
piteous
groan
of
despair
saying
we
are
lost
my
comrades
we
are
lost
unless
we
can
cool
our
burning
tongues
with
mercury
alas
graham
words
were
only
too
true
for
the
lake
which
must
have
covered
some
hundreds
of
acres
of
ground
was
one
thick
fluid
mass
of
quicksilver
we
sat
down
by
this
costly
yet
horrid
pool
too
overcome
with
bitter
disappointment
and
with
the
exertion
of
hastening
thither
to
speak
and
not
one
of
us
stirred
until
the
sun
had
set
and
night
approached
doctor
exclaimed
temple
at
last
in
a
weak
and
weary
voice
we
can
go
no
further
we
had
best
remain
here
and
die
but
doctor
hermann
made
no
answer
he
was
gazing
into
the
lake
at
our
feet
in
a
manner
muttering
incoherently
to
himself
about
majestic
phenomenon
and
wonderful
sight
and
then
he
sank
back
unconscious
the
scene
now
became
intensely
horrible
temple
sat
with
pale
hollow
cheeks
and
sunken
eyes
his
chin
resting
upon
his
knees
sandy
was
struggling
with
graham
to
reach
the
lake
swearing
he
would
have
water
if
he
killed
him
in
reaching
it
but
poor
sandy
was
weak
as
a
child
and
graham
in
very
kindness
hurled
him
to
the
ground
where
he
lay
like
one
dead
the
only
man
with
any
control
over
himself
or
with
any
strength
was
graham
and
he
stood
amongst
his
fallen
companions
gaunt
and
haggard
with
tears
of
sympathy
for
them
trickling
down
his
wan
wasted
cheeks
and
white
face
turned
upwards
to
the
sky
oh
god
he
cried
in
words
that
rattled
hoarsely
in
his
parched
and
burning
throat
oh
god
give
us
water
or
be
merciful
and
let
us
quickly
die
oh
echri
he
panted
servant
of
god
if
your
power
admits
hear
the
voice
of
him
who
wears
your
sacred
ring
crying
for
help
in
the
wilderness
and
send
him
succour
help
me
and
them
oh
god
echri
ring
volinè
but
the
last
words
became
but
rattling
meaningless
sounds
and
he
too
was
overcome
with
faintness
and
thirst
and
sank
down
among
the
rest
to
die
a
few
minutes
later
temple
alone
remained
conscious
but
he
felt
too
weak
to
move
and
he
sat
there
in
his
agony
watching
the
bright
merciless
stars
come
forth
one
by
one
and
the
distant
yellow
ball
of
earth
rise
steadily
above
the
mountains
until
a
drowsiness
overcame
him
and
he
mercifully
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
how
long
he
slumbered
we
shall
never
know
but
he
woke
trembling
with
cold
roused
from
his
sleep
by
the
chilly
blast
that
was
howling
and
shrieking
round
him
the
heavens
were
of
an
inky
blackness
save
at
irregular
intervals
when
the
blue
lightning
lit
up
the
banks
of
cloud
for
a
fleeting
moment
the
cold
wind
evidently
charged
with
moisture
had
brought
new
life
upon
its
wings
for
temple
and
he
felt
refreshed
he
was
still
too
weak
to
move
and
sat
shivering
in
astonished
silence
viewing
the
progress
of
the
storm
peal
after
peal
of
thunder
shook
the
ground
beneath
him
flash
after
flash
of
lightning
glanced
along
the
lake
of
mercury
and
illumined
its
smooth
waveless
surface
like
a
mirror
then
a
few
big
heavy
drops
of
rain
spattered
on
the
rocks
one
of
them
striking
him
full
on
his
forehead
a
minute
or
so
later
preceded
by
a
warning
roar
the
tempest
broke
in
all
its
fury
the
rain
beat
down
on
the
parched
ground
wetting
him
and
his
companions
to
the
skin
collecting
into
pools
and
flowing
in
tiny
rills
and
torrents
between
the
rocks
and
forming
channels
across
the
firmer
beds
of
sand
the
water
revived
temple
like
doses
of
some
magic
elixir
and
he
crawled
to
the
nearest
pool
and
drank
his
fill
of
this
sweet
refreshing
nectar
from
the
sky
then
amidst
the
tempest
strife
and
by
the
lightning
light
he
dragged
his
cold
and
aching
body
towards
his
fallen
comrades
his
cap
full
of
water
and
beginning
with
graham
who
was
lying
face
downwards
he
gently
parted
his
dry
cracked
lips
asunder
and
poured
a
few
drops
between
his
teeth
the
effect
was
instantaneous
and
he
showed
signs
of
returning
consciousness
by
bathing
his
forehead
he
was
soon
able
to
speak
thank
you
temple
he
faintly
murmured
i
shall
be
better
now
whoever
expected
rain
in
such
a
region
but
leave
me
and
lend
the
poor
doctor
some
assistance
i
am
afraid
he
is
in
a
bad
way
the
rain
had
served
sandy
too
in
a
remarkable
way
and
we
heard
him
groping
in
the
darkness
and
drinking
from
his
hands
which
he
filled
from
one
of
the
numerous
pools
around
us
in
half
an
hour
all
of
us
could
stand
except
the
doctor
he
was
alive
but
unable
to
move
or
speak
then
the
storm
ceased
the
sky
cleared
and
a
yellow
light
over
the
east
heralded
the
sun
daylight
revealed
the
heaviness
of
the
storm
we
were
surrounded
by
pools
of
sparkling
resting
in
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
and
the
mountain
sides
were
furrowed
with
crystal
streams
whose
volume
was
fast
becoming
less
as
the
sands
absorbed
them
sandy
by
graham
direction
crawled
off
to
search
for
the
and
the
packs
we
had
thrown
away
the
previous
evening
the
cask
we
broke
up
and
with
the
wood
we
made
a
small
fire
by
careful
management
we
contrived
to
heat
sufficient
water
to
make
of
the
meat
essence
and
a
cup
of
this
soon
put
new
life
into
the
doctor
poor
rover
was
almost
dead
and
lay
helpless
where
he
had
crouched
down
by
sandy
side
hours
before
and
it
took
all
his
master
care
to
bring
him
round
by
the
time
we
had
drunk
our
soup
the
sun
had
risen
and
his
generous
rays
the
rays
we
were
but
so
ready
to
curse
yesterday
soon
dried
our
dripping
garments
and
warmed
our
bodies
back
to
more
vigorous
life
we
also
dried
and
oiled
our
firearms
and
packed
our
knapsacks
afresh
but
we
were
all
too
weak
and
exhausted
to
march
and
we
decided
to
stay
and
rest
ourselves
for
a
few
hours
we
had
food
and
water
in
abundance
and
if
we
could
only
find
some
fuel
we
should
want
little
more
we
left
the
side
of
the
lake
and
took
up
our
quarters
under
the
lee
of
a
huge
mass
of
rock
and
here
we
stayed
until
noon
although
feeling
weak
we
were
then
determined
to
try
and
push
on
once
more
could
we
only
get
out
of
these
desert
regions
and
enter
a
more
fertile
country
all
might
yet
be
well
then
we
could
rest
to
our
heart
desire
and
recruit
our
wasted
strength
feebly
we
started
tottering
under
our
loads
but
thankful
to
god
that
our
lives
had
been
spared
once
more
and
that
the
pangs
of
a
burning
thirst
were
gone
truly
all
things
seemed
working
in
our
favour
for
had
the
rain
fallen
twelve
hours
later
not
one
of
us
would
have
survived
and
our
bones
would
now
be
bleaching
in
the
sun
on
that
desert
waste
the
ground
became
more
even
as
we
crawled
along
and
by
creeping
steadily
forward
we
covered
nearly
twenty
miles
before
sunset
then
the
country
began
to
improve
and
the
distant
hills
appeared
covered
with
forests
to
the
grasses
and
weeds
peeped
here
and
there
among
the
stones
and
a
mile
further
on
we
saw
a
few
stunted
bushes
something
like
a
clump
of
gorse
on
the
hillside
eagerly
and
with
strength
we
now
pushed
on
striving
every
nerve
to
reach
some
sort
of
cover
before
darkness
made
us
halt
for
the
night
we
were
not
disappointed
and
before
the
short
twilight
had
faded
we
found
ourselves
on
the
borders
of
a
dense
scrub
studded
here
and
there
with
small
trees
here
we
camped
close
to
a
pool
of
and
made
a
glorious
fire
of
dead
branches
with
which
we
cooked
our
evening
meal
then
stretching
our
weary
limbs
on
beds
of
leaves
we
rested
for
the
night
in
comparative
comfort
and
luxury
we
were
up
early
thanks
to
splendid
constitutions
the
effects
of
our
sufferings
in
the
desert
were
passing
rapidly
away
although
our
pale
and
haggard
faces
continued
to
reflect
our
recent
hardships
for
many
days
the
easiest
route
still
led
upwards
and
after
two
walking
through
a
region
rich
with
mineral
wealth
we
came
to
the
borders
of
a
forest
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
looked
down
upon
a
wide
and
fruitful
plain
covered
with
woods
and
fields
and
clusters
of
trees
three
miles
below
us
was
a
large
city
evidently
a
great
manufacturing
centre
for
there
were
furnaces
and
tall
belching
smoke
and
flame
and
we
could
even
hear
the
distant
hum
and
roar
of
busy
industry
the
change
from
desert
barren
wilderness
to
fat
and
fruitful
land
was
startlingly
sudden
and
for
many
moments
we
stood
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
looking
at
the
scene
below
us
in
silent
amazement
whilst
we
were
discussing
the
appearance
of
this
city
and
wondering
to
ourselves
what
industries
its
people
were
engaged
in
we
were
alarmed
by
cries
of
terror
from
a
thicket
a
little
way
to
the
left
and
almost
directly
afterwards
a
man
rushed
out
towards
us
pursued
by
a
beast
something
like
a
wild
boar
only
with
horns
growing
from
its
forehead
comprehending
in
a
moment
the
peril
the
poor
fellow
was
in
graham
without
more
ado
pointed
his
rifle
at
the
beast
and
fired
cleverly
bringing
it
down
dead
the
hunter
seemed
paralysed
with
terror
at
the
report
of
the
rifle
and
its
effects
and
stood
looking
at
us
in
amazement
we
are
friends
said
the
doctor
with
hands
held
out
towards
him
come
without
fear
and
give
us
greeting
you
are
safe
hearing
his
own
language
spoken
the
man
advanced
saying
as
he
did
so
strangers
my
heart
is
full
of
gratitude
for
the
service
ye
have
rendered
command
me
to
your
bidding
and
i
obey
i
am
from
pamax
yonder
my
name
is
kios
and
yours
we
are
strangers
to
your
country
and
your
world
we
come
from
the
star
which
you
call
ramos
which
we
call
earth
and
we
come
as
brothers
in
friendship
and
in
peace
answered
the
doctor
in
an
assuring
voice
are
ye
then
the
men
of
ramos
with
whose
evil
fame
all
gathma
rings
the
men
of
ramos
who
escaped
death
at
the
crag
remagaloth
are
ye
the
slayers
of
osa
if
so
be
ye
are
i
know
your
story
as
well
as
any
man
in
edos
for
we
listened
to
each
word
of
your
trial
and
sentence
here
in
pamax
the
same
are
we
but
what
know
you
of
our
captivity
there
have
you
any
tidings
from
edos
queried
graham
who
his
impatience
to
hear
any
possible
news
of
his
beloved
men
of
ramos
i
can
tell
ye
much
but
ye
look
faint
and
weary
follow
me
and
rest
your
tired
limbs
and
i
will
tell
ye
all
i
know
so
saying
the
hunter
for
such
we
judged
him
to
be
turned
and
beckoned
us
to
follow
him
throwing
the
huge
dead
beast
across
his
mighty
shoulders
as
he
went
he
led
the
way
to
a
camp
far
in
the
thicket
where
a
wood
fire
was
roasting
some
animal
before
a
cosy
tent
enter
men
of
ramos
enter
and
share
a
poor
man
hospitality
gladly
we
did
so
and
after
taking
off
our
knapsacks
we
seated
ourselves
on
some
soft
skins
and
listened
to
his
story
first
i
would
ask
ye
how
ye
came
hither
edos
is
many
days
journey
hence
for
they
who
needs
must
travel
by
stealth
or
on
foot
remagaloth
is
yet
further
i
heard
that
ye
escaped
into
the
sky
in
a
carriage
of
cunning
workmanship
came
ye
hence
in
that
you
speak
quite
truly
kios
said
graham
we
escaped
in
the
carriage
that
bore
us
from
earth
to
gathma
but
it
conveyed
us
to
a
desert
region
which
for
days
we
had
to
cross
on
foot
nearly
perishing
of
heat
and
thirst
on
the
way
the
barren
ground
of
which
ye
speak
is
the
desert
chados
and
i
marvel
much
to
learn
that
ye
have
crossed
it
and
yet
do
live
ye
are
now
in
the
woods
called
theloth
the
sole
right
and
privilege
of
hunting
therein
being
conferred
on
me
by
the
king
i
supply
the
palace
at
edos
with
wild
meat
and
herbs
and
i
came
from
the
city
but
yesterday
then
the
distance
can
not
surely
be
so
far
exclaimed
temple
we
travel
quickly
in
gathma
kios
answered
and
i
know
full
well
ye
could
not
have
come
by
the
same
means
as
i
so
you
left
edos
so
recently
then
do
you
know
aught
of
said
graham
in
eagerness
but
kios
with
upraised
finger
said
interrupt
me
not
i
will
tell
ye
all
i
know
but
i
must
speak
in
mine
own
way
the
news
of
your
miraculous
escape
from
death
continued
kios
is
on
every
tongue
both
in
edos
and
throughout
civilised
gathma
and
moreover
it
is
said
that
echri
with
his
wondrous
arts
did
save
ye
for
one
of
ye
did
wear
a
sacred
ring
of
his
upon
your
finger
ah
that
is
the
same
all
men
of
edos
know
it
well
said
kios
as
graham
held
out
his
hand
on
which
the
curious
talisman
glittered
the
king
and
his
ministers
are
wrath
enough
but
there
are
those
who
say
his
royal
anger
is
not
so
bitter
as
it
seemeth
and
that
volinè
his
daughter
hath
softened
his
heart
toward
ye
yet
in
this
i
only
repeat
the
gossip
of
the
streets
of
edos
and
know
not
its
truth
a
prince
by
name
perodii
fans
the
king
smouldering
wrath
by
taunts
and
what
methinks
are
probably
falsehoods
concerning
ye
no
man
in
all
edos
save
the
king
is
so
powerful
as
he
nor
is
there
a
bigger
blackguard
within
its
walls
be
warned
against
him
for
his
soul
is
full
of
evil
and
he
seeks
your
ruin
at
his
instigation
troops
are
searching
the
country
through
to
find
ye
and
if
ye
be
taken
captive
once
more
no
mercy
will
be
shown
ye
if
perodii
can
prevent
it
i
hate
this
perodii
with
a
deadly
bitter
hatred
for
he
ruined
my
only
child
curse
him
know
you
aught
of
volinè
the
king
daughter
or
of
kaosp
a
worthy
commander
of
the
troops
in
edos
asked
graham
anxiously
of
volinè
i
have
no
tidings
of
kaosp
i
know
nought
but
ill
he
lies
in
prison
thrown
there
some
say
for
treason
to
the
king
yet
others
have
it
that
perodii
lying
tongue
hath
forged
his
fetters
we
are
exceedingly
grateful
for
the
news
you
have
told
us
said
the
doctor
warmly
and
your
tidings
will
prove
a
great
service
to
us
but
we
would
ask
you
for
further
information
about
the
city
below
us
pamax
i
think
you
call
it
is
it
safe
for
us
to
venture
therein
no
ye
go
there
at
peril
of
your
liberty
and
lives
know
ye
not
that
pamax
doth
great
trade
with
edos
the
king
troops
are
even
there
now
in
quest
of
ye
pamax
is
a
city
of
rough
where
dirt
and
squalour
are
as
plentiful
as
gold
and
splendour
in
edos
the
people
that
dwell
in
pamax
are
cunning
workers
in
metals
the
hills
around
us
are
honeycombed
with
their
mines
electric
ways
radiate
from
this
city
in
all
directions
to
convey
its
merchandise
to
every
part
of
gathma
it
is
a
wondrous
city
and
its
men
are
clever
artificers
yet
they
are
low
of
mind
and
would
in
their
stupid
ignorance
hand
ye
over
to
the
guards
at
once
but
four
days
journey
hence
is
the
bright
and
noble
city
of
helmath
full
of
scientific
and
people
a
great
centre
of
knowledge
and
a
lofty
seat
of
learning
thither
bend
your
steps
for
those
therein
may
welcome
ye
and
plead
your
cause
with
the
king
tarry
with
me
here
for
a
day
or
so
as
my
guests
revive
your
wasted
strength
and
rest
your
wearied
bodies
with
me
i
promise
ye
safety
in
the
woods
of
theloth
and
will
send
ye
on
your
way
to
helmath
with
light
and
hopeful
hearts
we
consulted
together
for
a
moment
and
then
unanimously
decided
to
accept
the
kind
invitation
kios
had
so
generously
offered
us
we
needed
rest
we
sought
safety
and
here
we
could
obtain
both
for
a
few
days
at
least
we
had
already
unbounded
confidence
in
this
hunter
and
felt
that
our
safety
was
doubly
assured
through
his
bitter
hatred
of
perodii
chapter
xv
rivals
meet
again
for
three
days
we
stayed
with
kios
and
enjoyed
his
hospitality
he
literally
nursed
us
back
to
health
and
strength
making
us
savoury
nourishing
dishes
with
a
hunter
cunning
and
giving
us
a
preparation
of
medicinal
herbs
which
acted
as
a
powerful
tonic
on
our
nerves
and
braced
us
exceedingly
he
gave
up
his
bed
to
the
doctor
and
in
countless
ways
covered
us
with
kindness
the
day
before
we
left
his
camp
we
prevailed
upon
him
to
leave
us
and
go
down
the
hills
into
pamax
to
gain
tidings
of
the
soldiers
who
were
in
search
of
us
whilst
he
was
away
we
cleaned
our
firearms
repacked
our
knapsacks
and
made
all
ready
for
starting
at
dawn
on
the
following
day
kios
returned
towards
sunset
but
eager
as
we
were
to
learn
his
tidings
we
would
not
question
him
until
he
had
eaten
nor
did
he
evince
any
desire
to
communicate
them
before
now
good
kios
we
would
hear
your
news
said
the
doctor
as
we
drew
round
the
camp
fire
and
lit
our
cigars
it
is
not
altogether
good
as
i
had
hoped
he
began
the
people
can
talk
of
nothing
else
but
the
men
of
ramos
meaning
yourselves
their
excitement
hath
increased
for
some
traders
who
had
journeyed
to
the
lake
of
kimeth
near
which
ye
have
told
me
ye
camped
returned
to
pamax
yesternight
bringing
with
them
scraps
of
strange
food
and
other
refuse
ye
must
have
left
behind
the
troops
have
started
thither
at
dawn
this
morning
and
what
is
worse
that
villain
perodii
is
at
their
head
he
will
never
rest
until
ye
are
all
once
more
in
his
power
for
he
bears
ye
strange
and
deadly
hatred
but
kios
began
the
doctor
nay
hear
me
out
men
of
ramos
for
i
have
but
few
more
words
to
say
it
is
fortunate
for
ye
that
the
troops
have
gone
on
this
fool
errand
for
they
may
search
far
and
wide
up
there
and
the
time
they
waste
ye
will
profit
by
yet
when
they
return
to
pamax
as
return
they
surely
will
perodii
mood
will
not
be
pleasant
and
ye
may
be
assured
that
the
journey
to
the
borders
of
chados
will
not
tend
to
cool
his
wrath
against
ye
men
of
ramos
ye
must
not
linger
here
i
can
not
answer
for
your
safety
longer
these
woods
will
be
searched
and
it
may
be
at
daybreak
ye
must
start
for
helmath
nay
at
once
but
we
are
in
ignorance
of
the
way
thither
and
may
lose
ourselves
in
the
darkness
said
temple
trouble
not
yourselves
for
i
will
guide
ye
a
few
hours
journey
hence
and
put
ye
in
the
path
that
leads
thereto
i
am
afraid
worthy
kios
we
shall
never
be
able
to
repay
you
said
the
doctor
ye
saved
my
life
it
is
but
well
that
i
should
seek
to
save
yours
in
return
besides
i
aim
perodii
a
blow
through
ye
and
it
is
always
sweet
to
strike
one
enemies
know
ye
i
was
rich
and
noble
once
with
rank
and
dignity
almost
as
high
as
he
through
his
knavery
and
wickedness
i
am
degraded
to
the
calling
of
a
hunter
to
the
palace
banished
from
my
home
in
edos
and
owe
what
little
i
now
possess
even
my
life
itself
to
the
clemency
of
the
king
some
day
the
truth
may
prevail
and
i
be
restored
to
my
rights
had
perodii
honour
enough
left
to
speak
he
could
accomplish
this
in
few
words
yet
he
remains
silent
and
i
suffer
because
i
resented
the
great
wrong
he
did
me
but
we
waste
time
in
needless
words
get
ye
ready
and
let
us
hasten
hence
for
the
path
is
heavy
and
the
way
is
long
we
reluctantly
left
our
comfortable
quarters
and
started
off
with
kios
through
the
darkness
the
night
was
calm
and
beautifully
fine
just
one
of
those
delicious
evenings
that
make
the
tropics
of
earth
so
sweet
when
the
broiling
heat
of
the
day
is
spent
kios
led
us
by
a
circuitous
route
down
the
wooded
hillside
and
we
passed
so
near
to
pamax
that
the
roar
of
its
machinery
sounded
clearly
in
the
night
and
the
glow
from
its
thousands
of
furnaces
shone
against
the
sky
like
a
mighty
conflagration
the
men
of
pamax
work
late
remarked
temple
with
a
instinct
and
thinking
of
his
own
noisy
looms
at
home
on
earth
the
wheels
of
their
machinery
are
never
still
answered
kios
the
worker
lot
is
hard
but
they
are
a
cheerful
community
if
their
greed
of
gain
is
great
we
soon
passed
pamax
with
its
noise
and
fire
and
reached
the
calm
quiet
country
again
at
last
the
forest
was
left
behind
us
and
we
walked
for
an
hour
across
a
wide
prairie
on
which
grew
herbs
of
singular
odour
then
we
followed
the
banks
of
a
wide
river
and
after
passing
through
a
dark
and
dangerous
swampy
jungle
something
like
the
forest
of
reeds
in
which
we
first
descended
kios
stopped
and
said
men
of
ramos
here
i
must
leave
ye
the
night
will
be
nearly
spent
ere
i
get
back
to
the
woods
of
theloth
and
there
are
those
who
must
not
see
me
return
look
ye
at
yonder
group
of
stars
pointing
as
he
spoke
to
a
constellation
something
like
ursa
major
the
great
bear
in
our
own
heavens
mark
ye
them
well
keep
them
straight
before
ye
and
in
two
hours
march
ye
will
reach
the
sea
strike
north
along
the
coast
a
short
day
journey
until
ye
come
to
a
rocky
creek
follow
the
stream
that
falls
therein
skirting
the
base
of
a
spent
volcano
and
in
three
days
more
easy
travelling
ye
will
sight
the
great
observatory
of
helmath
standing
on
a
high
hill
on
your
right
hand
behind
that
hill
is
the
city
itself
advance
ye
with
caution
and
hold
no

the
men
of
gathma
until
ye
reach
helmath
or
swift
and
certain

will
overtake
ye
now
haste
away
and
fare
ye
well
without
waiting
to
hear
our
words
of
thanks
for
all
his
kindness
kios
waved
his
hand
to
us
in
farewell
and
walked
away
into
the
gloom
we
travelled
slower
without
his
guidance
for
the
way
was
rough
and
sometimes
clouds
obscured
the
stars
which
were
our
beacon
light
and
we
had
oft
to
wait
until
they
had
drifted
by
instead
therefore
of
reaching
the
coast
in
two
hours
we
were
nearly
six
and
the
day
was
breaking
as
the
grey
waters
of
the
gathma
sea
spread
far
and
wide
before
us
we
were
both
tired
and
hungry
and
so
amongst
the
rocks
on
the
beach
we
made
a
fire
and
had
our
breakfast
then
we
sat
and
rested
for
two
hours
before
beginning
our
march
along
the
coast
after
crossing
some
four
miles
of
level
sand
we
reached
a
dense
forest
which
extended
from
the
margin
of
the
water
inland
beyond
the
range
of
our
vision
here
the
curious
vegetation
was
so
dense
that
the
sun
failed
to
penetrate
the
canopy
of
foliage
but
the
ground
was
bare
of
brushwood
and
walking
was
easy
and
pleasant
some
curious
trees
shaped
like
a
mighty
fungus
or
an
open
umbrella
excited
our
wonder
they
bore
no
leaves
but
threw
out
a
thick
unbroken
canopy
of
the
colour
and
texture
of
an
aloe
plant
which
curved
downwards
nearly
to
the
ground
and
above
this
from
the
centre
of
the
stem
shot
a
spike
of
crimson
flowers
a
yard
or
more
in
length
each
tree
formed
an
admirable
tent
and
many
of
them
seemed
to
be
of
vast
age
the
canopy
being
furrowed
as
with
the
growth
of
centuries
the
edges
torn
into
dry
and
withered
ribbons
and
the
stems
of
enormous
girth
at
first
we
really
took
them
to
be
the
habitations
of
human
beings
or
beasts
and
it
was
not
until
we
had
examined
them
closely
that
we
ascertained
they
were
really
trees
as
we
went
farther
into
the
forest
these
curious
trees
increased
in
number
and
in
size
indeed
in
some
places
they
covered
the
ground
so
thickly
that
it
was
difficult
to
walk
amongst
them
and
we
found
it
best
and
quickest
to
make
a
detour
in
passing
one
of
these
groves
of
vegetable
umbrellas
we
were
startled
by
a
perfect
tumult
of
chattering
cries
and
scores
of
strange
beings
hurried
out
from
under
them
and
surrounded
us
skipping
and
hopping
about
running
to
and
fro
like
fiends
in
the
dusky
light
of
the
forest
had
we
not
seen
these
singular
beings
with
our
own
eyes
we
should
never
have
believed
in
their
existence
they
were
fashioned
much
like
ourselves
from
the
feet
to
the
shoulders
the
arms
however
being
proportionately
much
shorter
but
there
all
outward
resemblance
ceased
neck
they
had
none
the
shoulders
gradually
tapering
away
to
the
head
which
was
free
from
hair
and
the
face
was
intermediate
in
expression
between
that
of
a
man
and
the
higher
or
simian
race
of
beasts
their
bodies
were
entirely
naked
and
of
a
colour
and
they
averaged
perhaps
five
feet
in
height
so
fierce
and
threatening
did
these
curious
creatures
become
that
we
fired
our
rifles
off
to
frighten
them
which
had
the
desired
effect
and
they
fled
in
chattering
terror
grinning
and
grimacing
into
the
trees
and
we
saw
them
no
more
whether
they
were
gifted
with
greater
than
brute
intelligence
we
know
not
we
were
too
startled
and
alarmed
to
make
a
closer
acquaintance
with
them
hermann
himself
was
visibly
disconcerted
and
the
rest
of
us
were
glad
when
they
vanished
from
our
sight
sandy
especially
so
he
dreaded
the
doctor
sending
him
in
quest
of
one
of
these
curious
creatures
even
our
dog
refused
to
go
near
them
and
lay
down
trembling
with
fright
illustration
scores
of
strange
beasts
hurried
out
from
under
them
it
seemed
incredible
that
such
a
race
of
animals
could
exist
so
near
to
so
mighty
and
populous
a
town
as
pamax
but
we
were
in
a
world
of
surprises
and
things
that
appeared
unnatural
to
us
were
rational
enough
no
doubt
to
the
dwellers
on
the
land
of
mars
all
day
we
passed
through
this
wonderful
forest
now
catching
a
glimpse
of
broad
daylight
as
the
trees
grew
less
closely
together
then
entering
a
world
of
shadows
and
steamy
gloom
as
the
canopy
became
denser
once
more
we
saw
trees
that
were
nothing
but
bare
poles
tapering
to
a
point
far
up
in
the
sky
without
branch
or
leaf
except
a
little
green
cup
at
the
summit
others
were
draped
in
foliage
others
yet
again
decked
in
noble
leaves
a
dozen
feet
across
some
put
us
in
mind
of
the
earthly
tropics
but
the
great
majority
were
entirely
new
both
in
growth
and
form
the
vegetable
wonders
around
us
made
us
forget
our
fatigue
and
even
our
hunger
we
never
once
thought
to
halt
and
rest
throughout
the
livelong
day
and
we
continued
walking
on
and
on
through
the
forest
until
we
reached
the
creek
which
kios
had
told
us
we
should
find
at
the
end
of
our
journey
it
was
a
wild
lonely
spot
enclosed
with
tall
cliffs
on
either
side
and
perhaps
half
a
mile
across
the
forest
continued
on
the
other
side
at
the
top
of
the
rocks
as
it
ceased
on
this
we
had
little
trouble
in
finding
a
suitable
by
the
side
of
a
tiny
stream
which
tumbled
over
the
cliffs
in
a
shower
of
spray
into
the
creek
below
and
furnished
us
with
fresh
water
that
of
the
sea
being
salt
and
bitter
to
the
taste
here
we
formed
a
rude
hut
of
branches
made
our
fire
and
cooked
some
of
the
dried
meat
that
kios
had
insisted
we
should
take
when
we
left
his
the
previous
evening
we
decided
that
one
of
us
should
keep
watch
while
the
others
slept
in
case
of
our
retreat
being
discovered
by
enemies
but
the
night
passed
uneventfully
away
nothing
occurring
to
disturb
our
slumbers
or
to
break
our
peace
we
were
moving
early
and
off
on
our
way
by
sunrise
for
the
first
hour
or
so
we
followed
the
creek
through
the
depths
of
the
forest
but
when
we
reached
the
river
the
aspect
of
the
country
changed
considerably
it
was
now
an
undulating
land
with
groves
of
trees
far
away
on
the
horizon
loomed
the
towering
heights
of
the
exhausted
volcano
round
whose
base
was
the
path
we
had
to
follow
the
scenery
was
very
beautiful
but
somehow
we
had
not
the
heart
to
admire
it
for
we
felt
like
fugitives
flying
to
a
castle
of
refuge
through
a
land
teeming
with
unknown
perils
and
hidden
enemies
we
left
the
river
as
the
banks
were
too
steep
and
uneven
to
follow
and
gradually
ascended
the
lower
spurs
of
the
mountain
that
being
by
far
the
easiest
route
by
noon
we
halted
under
the
towering
crest
of
the
dead
volcano
the
sides
were
steep
and
rocky
though
covered
with
many
kinds
of
vegetation
notably
a
large
tree
with
leaves
and
flowers
like
a
rhododendron
here
a
deep
hollow
had
become
a
small
lake
fringed
with
curious
rushes
over
whose
placid
waters
a
large
troop
of
white
legless
birds
similar
to
those
we
saw
before
were
disporting
themselves
here
we
made
a
fire
and
cooked
some
food
as
we
were
quietly
eating
our
meal
we
were
startled
by
an
exclamation
from
graham
look
look
he
cried
in
an
excited
tone
the
troops
the
troops
from
edos
we
are
discovered
surrounded
the
peril
of
our
position
was
only
too
true
stealthily
our
pursuers
had
spread
themselves
in
a
wide
semicircle
from
the
river
extending
their
flanks
round
either
side
of
the
mountain
and
though
still
nearly
a
mile
away
they
were
closing
upon
us
with
frightful
haste
leave
all
but
the
firearms
and
ammunition
and
follow
me
shouted
the
doctor
leading
the
way
up
the
hillside
amongst
the
dense
brushwood
our
movement
was
noticed
at
once
by
the
approaching
soldiers
and
with
a
lusty
shout
they
came
on
in
hot
pursuit
but
the
way
was
rough
and
steep
and
we
had
the
advantage
of
being
much
higher
up
the
mountain
slope
than
they
for
quite
two
miles
we
struggled
on
without
losing
ground
or
gaining
it
until
we
reached
a
part
of
the
which
was
strewn
with
huge
boulders
of
pumice
here
we
lost
sight
of
our
pursuers
although
we
could
hear
their
shouts
and
below
us
and
sank
down
to
rest
a
moment
and
get
our
breath
we
had
not
tarried
here
for
more
than
half
a
minute
when
sandy
practised
eye
caught
sight
of
a
hole
in
the
ground
twenty
paces
lower
down
the
hill
we
went
to
examine
it
and
found
that
it
was
a
crevice
in
the
side
of
the
volcano
just
large
enough
at
the
entrance
to
squeeze
our
bodies
through
but
soon
becoming
much
larger
inside
quick
said
the
doctor
help
me
to
roll
this
block
of
pumice
to
the
entrance
we
can
hide
in
this
hole
at
any
rate
it
is
a
chance
our
only
chance
we
will
place
the
stone
so
that
once
inside
we
can
roll
it
over
the
opening
and
by
this
means
conceal
the
hole
from
view
should
the
soldiers
happen
to
pass
over
the
spot
the
huge
mass
of
pumice
was
exceedingly
light
and
we
found
no
difficulty
in
doing
what
the
doctor
had
suggested
one
after
the
other
we
scrambled
into
the
hillside
crevice
and
then
graham
he
being
the
strongest
managed
to
pull
the
stone
over
us
and
we
were
immediately
in
darkness
now
for
the
first
time
we
missed
poor
rover
in
our
anxiety
and
excitement
we
had
not
noticed
him
near
us
for
some
time
nor
did
we
ever
see
the
faithful
old
dog
again
here
for
half
an
hour
we
remained
motionless
huddled
together
and
not
daring
to
speak
in
voices
higher
than
a
whisper
we
heard
shout
after
shout
from
the
troopers
and
signal
after
signal
from
their
trumpets
and
we
knew
our
enemies
were
baffled
for
we
whom
they
sought
so
eagerly
had
utterly
vanished
we
heard
them
clambering
over
the
boulders
and
dislodging
the
smaller
stones
as
they
wandered
hither
and
thither
round
the
place
where
we
were
concealed
and
once
a
big
warrior
panting
for
breath
actually
came
and
leaned
against
the
block
of
pumice
that
concealed
our
and
then
went
his
way
at
last
all
became
still
near
at
hand
we
could
hear
our
enemies
in
the
distance
but
the
sound
they
made
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
then
ceased
altogether
they
were
gone
and
for
the
present
at
least
we
were
saved
meantime
we
had
not
been
idle
as
soon
as
we
dared
move
without
the
possibility
of
the
soldiers
hearing
us
we
began
to
explore
our
refuge
the
rift
extended
downwards
and
inwards
towards
the
centre
of
the
mountain
but
the
jagged
rocks
and
the
darkness
made
our
progress
most
perilous
and
at
last
we
had
to
give
up
in
despair
we
struck
a
few
graham
chanced
to
have
in
one
of
his
pockets
but
their
feeble
flame
only
served
to
render
the
surrounding
darkness
more
hideous
and
profound
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
return
to
the
entrance
and
there
we
waited
and
waited
all
the
afternoon
until
sunset
fearful
to
go
out
until
the
night
should
cloak
our
movements
from
the
view
of
any
enemies
still
lurking
near
as
the
short
twilight
was
coming
to
an
end
the
doctor
said
in
a
low
tone
one
of
us
must
go
back
to
the
camp
by
the
lake
for
our
knapsacks
we
must
have
food
if
by
any
possible
good
fortune
these
troops
have
left
our
things
undisturbed
the
rest
must
stay
here
for
i
think
we
could
not
find
safer
quarters
for
a
day
or
so
until
our
enemies
have
grown
weary
of
the
search
and
depart
to
try
elsewhere
i
am
ready
no
doctor
broke
in
graham
i
will
not
hear
of
what
you
were
about
to
propose
i
volunteer
the
task
of
going
back
myself
you
are
far
from
strong
yet
and
the
fatigue
is
too
much
for
you
but
i
am
willing
to
go
said
temple
let
me
go
doctor
i
can
be
back
in
no
time
i
am
more
used
to
the
hills
than
any
o
ye
pleaded
sandy
enough
comrades
the
task
after
all
is
a
trivial
one
you
remain
here
i
will
go
graham
answered
and
pushing
the
block
aside
as
he
spoke
he
scrambled
out
into
the
evening
gloom
and
we
heard
his
cautious
footsteps
sounding
fainter
and
fainter
as
he
went
his
way
he
picked
a
path
down
the
steep
hillside
and
struggled
through
the
thickets
every
now
and
then
stopping
to
listen
in
half
an
hour
he
reached
the
lake
but
owing
to
the
darkness
he
had
mistaken
the
path
and
gone
nearly
a
mile
to
the
east
of
the
spot
where
our
camp
had
been
perhaps
it
was
fortunate
that
he
did
so
for
across
the
water
he
saw
the
blazing
fires
of
a
great
encampment
and
dusky
figures
passing
to
and
fro
before
them
so
the
troops
of
edos
had
not
given
up
the
search
so
readily
and
perodii
evidently
was
determined
on
revenge
cautiously
graham
made
a
detour
and
reached
the
big
rock
where
we
had
eaten
our
last
meal
and
there
to
his
joy
he
found
our
knapsacks
by
the
side
of
the
blackened
ashes
of
the
fire
strong
man
as
he
was
he
did
not
feel
able
to
carry
the
four
heavy
packages
he
therefore
hid
two
under
a
heap
of
pumice
stones
and
trudged
off
back
up
the
hill
with
the
rest
he
experienced
great
difficulty
in
getting
back
again
and
even
more
in
finding
the
block
of
stone
that
concealed
our
retreat
indeed
it
is
doubtful
if
he
ever
would
have
found
it
at
all
had
we
not
heard
him
stumbling
about
the
stones
and
guided
him
to
the
cave
by
our
signal
whistles
we
were
glad
graham
had
got
back
safely
and
to
see
that
he
had
brought
so
much
of
our
belongings
but
the
news
that
he
had
seen
the
of
our
enemies
sank
like
cold
despair
into
our
hearts
we
had
a
bitterly
relentless
foe
to
deal
with
and
our
situation
seemed
growing
more
and
more
hopeless
i
am
very
glad
you
brought
my
knapsack
graham
said
the
doctor
as
it
contains
my
electric
lamp
we
will
now
go
further
into
the
cave
as
it
is
important
that
we
should
know
the
extent
of
our
resources
when
the
hour
of
need
comes
by
the
light
from
wax
tapers
burnt
one
after
the
other
we
got
the
package
undone
and
soon
had
the
lamp
in
working
order
its
brilliant
rays
the
cavity
so
well
that
we
could
see
many
yards
before
us
the
doctor
led
the
way
lamp
in
hand
and
following
him
we
climbed
down
deeper
and
deeper
and
further
and
further
into
the
very
bowels
of
the
dead
volcano
the
cavern
now
began
to
reach
an
enormous
size
and
our
light
was
powerless
to
pierce
the
great
blackness
around
us
comparatively
speaking
for
any
distance
at
first
the
lamp
illuminated
the
rugged
walls
of
this
ancient
furnace
and
the
rocks
in
every
conceivable
fantastic
shape
looked
grim
and
ghostly
in
the
blue
electric
light
but
as
we
went
on
and
on
these
jagged
cliffs
moulded
by
the
molten
fires
of
ages
gradually
receded
from
the
penetrating
light
until
at
last
the
rough
ground
beneath
us
was
all
that
was
visible
and
the
vast
immeasurable
dome
of
the
extinct
crater
loomed
in
dark
weird
mystery
around
us
our
lamp
but
as
a
feeble
star
within
its
profound
unknown
depths
we
must
have
travelled
nearly
a
mile
into
the
mountain
when
we
were
surprised
beyond
measure
to
see
the
starry
vault
of
heaven
through
a
vast
rent
in
the
top
of
the
cavern
thousands
of
feet
above
our
heads
the
crater
the
entire
mountain
was
hollow
and
the
hole
in
the
shell
above
us
had
been
the
vent
for
its
now
fire
we
were
actually
in
the
very
core
of
a
volcano
we
proceeded
but
a
few
more
steps
when
the
rays
from
our
lamp
revealed
a
vast
yawning
chasm
before
us
the
light
reflecting
on
a
gulf
of
blackness
and
not
being
powerful
enough
to
illumine
the
furthermost
edge
of
the
pit
we
shuddered
as
we
looked
at
the
awful
abyss
and
pictured
to
ourselves
our
ghastly
fate
if
we
had
by
some
fatality
walked
over
its
terrible
edge
an
immense
block
of
stone
that
graham
and
sandy
rolled
down
the
steep
declivity
which
led
to
the
actual
chasm
pitched
into
the
blackness
and
we
heard
it
thundering
down
into
the
dizzy
depths
first
striking
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
as
it
rebounded
in
its
awful
leaps
like
a
mere
pebble
the
sounds
echoing
and
through
the
hollow
dome
around
us
then
the
blows
sounded
fainter
and
fainter
to
our
ears
and
finally
died
completely
away
as
if
the
boulder
had
leaped
into
another
vaulted
cavern
still
lower
down
or
been
ground
to
dust
by
the
force
of
its
fall
and
we
heard
no
more
here
under
the
very
crest
of
the
mountain
amongst
the
very
roots
of
this
rugged
volcano
we
lay
down
to
rest
but
not
one
of
us
could
sleep
the
grandeur
of
the
surroundings
kept
us
awake
even
though
we
had
put
out
our
lamp
and
the
only
ray
of
light
in
the
pitchy
darkness
was
the
opening
above
us
to
the
sky
all
night
we
lay
here
watching
the
scintillating
stars
like
fiery
gems
until
one
by
one
they
became
wan
and
indistinct
with
the
coming
dawn
and
gradually
the
space
around
us
was
illumined
as
with
a
twilight
brightness
the
sun
had
risen
and
the
outer
world
was
bathed
in
warmth
yet
only
a
sickly
reflection
of
the
day
penetrated
into
our
magnificently
grand
if
cold
and
dismal
refuge
anon
the
sun
in
his
course
across
the
sky
shone
down
the
mouth
of
the
crater
and
the
light
became
stronger
we
seated
ourselves
in
the
circle
of
his
rays
and
here
we
ate
our
cheerless
meal
the
remainder
of
the
flesh
we
had
had
from
kios
and
a
few
biscuits
fortunately
our
water
supply
was
ample
the
precious
liquid
dropped
incessantly
from
far
up
in
the
rugged
heights
of
the
hollow
mountain
roof
it
trickled
along
the
ground
and
accumulated
in
little
pools
among
the
pumice
stones
at
our
feet
as
we
ate
our
meal
and
tried
to
warm
our
chilled
bodies
in
the
faint
sunshine
a
great
mass
of
rock
came
hurtling
down
from
the
very
summit
and
leaped
with
an
awful
rushing
sound
into
the
chasm
and
for
long
we
heard
its
terrific
progress
into
the
uttermost
depths
of
the
volcano
we
looked
up
in
terror
and
sprang
to
our
feet
expecting
each
moment
to
be
our
last
and
that
the
mountain
itself
was
going
to
collapse
and
bury
us
like
moles
beneath
its
tottering
ruins
but
even
a
worse
fate
than
that
threatened
us
for
boldly
outlined
against
the
sky
with
helmets
glinting
in
the
sun
peering
down
into
the
gloomy
depths
were
several
of
the
troops
from
edos
in
the
very
act
of
hurling
another
piece
of
rock
upon
us
we
started
back
in
horror
and
hurried
out
of
the
focus
of
that
aperture
burying
ourselves
from
sight
in
the
surrounding
gloom
so
our
is
discovered
and
we
may
expect
no
mercy
from
the
bloodhounds
said
graham
we
will
fight
for
liberty
this
time
rejoined
the
doctor
in
a
cool
and
resolute
voice
fight
and
die
fighting
he
continued
rather
than
fall
into
the
power
of
those
merciless
people
of
edos
again
temple
and
sandy
were
equally
determined
to
fight
to
the
last
and
we
began
to
prepare
ourselves
for
the
coming
fray
we
again
turned
on
our
electric
lamp
and
retreated
into
the
darkest
depths
of
the
cavern
in
search
of
some
spot
where
we
might
advantageously
fight
our
foes
we
discovered
a
small
mound
of
broken
rocks
on
the
floor
of
the
mountain
and
on
the
summit
of
this
we
built
up
a
rough
rampart
behind
which
we
might
find
some
shelter
when
firing
then
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
we
carefully
examined
our
rifles
and
revolvers
and
made
ready
our
ammunition
we
agreed
that
graham
and
sandy
should
fire
they
being
the
best
shots
and
that
the
doctor
and
temple
should
load
and
hand
the
weapons
if
we
came
to
close
quarters
each
was
to
use
his
own
revolver
as
best
he
could
before
we
had
finished
all
our
preparations
the
great
mountain
vault
began
to
echo
with
the
steps
of
advancing
troops
clearly
they
knew
of
this
wondrous
cavern
and
must
have
been
aware
of
other
and
easier
ways
of
entrance
than
the
one
we
had
chanced
to
discover
they
were
searching
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
mountain
as
they
came
and
we
could
now
form
some
idea
of
the
vastness
of
the
cavern
by
the
length
of
the
advancing
line
of
troops
what
astonished
us
most
was
their
method
of
illuminating
their
path
through
the
darkness
as
seen
from
the
distance
of
a
mile
the
movements
of
the
coming
troops
were
marked
by
a
line
of
little
irregularly
dancing
and
bobbing
to
and
fro
and
as
the
soldiers
came
nearer
we
saw
that
each
one
had
what
appeared
to
be
an
incandescent
lamp
attached
to
his
left
ankle
which
lit
up
the
ground
before
him
for
a
few
yards
we
held
our
breath
in
our
great
excitement
and
curiously
watched
the
foe
then
sandy
and
graham
each
took
their
trusty
rifles
and
knelt
behind
the
rough
rampart
ready
to
fire
the
moment
a
good
opportunity
occurred
it
was
no
use
waiting
until
the
troops
advanced
because
discovery
was
certain
their
line
of
coming
searchers
were
bound
to
cross
the
hill
on
which
we
were
entrenched
our
was
still
undiscovered
and
the
troops
were
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
away
we
watched
the
line
of
lights
break
into
two
and
circle
round
the
yawning
gulf
we
saw
a
few
troopers
advance
into
the
subdued
light
below
the
crater
mouth
and
then
disappear
again
into
the
darkness
then
graham
covered
one
of
the
dusky
forms
and
after
taking
careful
aim
pulled
the
trigger
and
missed
the
line
was
unbroken
a
second
afterwards
sandy
piece
went
off
with
no
better
luck
the
light
being
too
uncertain
for
accurate
aim
the
awful
echoes
that
our
exploding
rifles
raised
are
beyond
the
powers
of
language
to
describe
them
the
vast
vault
seemed
to
be
cracking
in
twain
and
the
reverberations
appeared
never
going
to
subside
for
a
moment
the
troops
were
filled
with
panic
but
we
heard
voices
as
of
commanders
cheering
and
encouraging
their
faltering
men
and
a
moment
after
we
were
literally
blinded
by
a
vivid
flood
of
brilliant
light
which
gleamed
out
from
behind
us
dazzled
and
blinded
though
we
were
we
saw
at
once
that
we
were
surrounded
by
enemies
another
detachment
having
surprised
us
from
the
rear
we
were
now
as
exposed
to
view
as
if
we
had
been
in
the
open
air
under
the
blazing
sun
of
noonday
and
before
one
of
us
could
recover
from
his
astonishment
and
fire
a
shot
in
defence
our
position
was
stormed
our
rifles
and
revolvers
wrenched
from
our
hands
and
we
were
helpless
as
babes
in
the
power
of
our
enemies
what
the
light
really
was
whence
it
came
or
how
it
was
produced
we
knew
not
but
it
continued
burning
until
we
and
our
captors
reached
the
open
air
the
wild
savage
scene
of
grandeur
revealed
when
the
hollow
mountain
was
made
to
disclose
its
hidden
splendour
by
the
penetrating
light
can
never
fade
from
our
memory
though
captives
and
bowed
down
with
hopeless
despair
we
were
compelled
to
look
nay
even
to
admire
the
misery
of
our
position
was
forgotten
in
the
glory
of
that
cave
whose
appearance
bore
eloquent
and
silent
testimony
to
the
stupendous
forces
of
volcanic
action
the
brilliant
light
lit
up
even
the
very
highest
parts
of
the
lofty
mountain
dome
showing
hollows
and
jagged
points
and
enormous
masses
of
gold
and
silver
and
other
but
to
us
unknown
metals
which
had
formed
there
as
the
molten
interior
of
the
volcano
had
suddenly
cooled
in
rest
some
of
the
rocks
scintillated
with
unconsumable
crystals
others
were
ground
smooth
as
marble
by
the
troubled
action
of
a
seething
sea
and
great
masses
formed
of
a
dozen
different
metals
were
to
be
seen
here
and
there
wedged
in
between
the
ruin
of
rocks
so
rugged
and
loose
was
the
roof
in
some
places
that
it
looked
as
if
the
very
echoes
of
our
footsteps
would
dislodge
acres
of
boulders
and
send
them
tumbling
down
in
mad
confusion
but
we
were
marched
as
quickly
as
possible
out
of
the
mountain
and
in
spite
of
our
cruel
fate
in
our
hearts
we
were
thankful
to
leave
this
terrible
chasm
behind
us
and
once
more
to
find
ourselves
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
in
the
full
and
blessed
light
of
day
we
were
immediately
manacled
and
conducted
to
the
camp
by
the
lake
where
in
a
spacious
tent
perodii
sat
in
state
a
gleam
of
intense
hatred
passed
over
his
dark
and
savagely
handsome
face
as
we
were
marshalled
into
his
presence
all
graham
courageous
spirit
seemed
to
return
as
he
looked
once
more
upon
his
rival
and
his
enemy
and
he
returned
perodii
glances
with
a
look
of
withering
and
defiant
scorn
so
man
of
ramos
with
all
thy
cunning
and
with
all
thy
magic
arts
thou
hast
fallen
once
more
into
my
power
said
perodii
in
a
sarcastic
voice
addressing
graham
alone
and
seeming
not
to
notice
the
rest
of
us
at
all
shall
meet
again
thou
saidst
at
remagaloth
and
we
have
done
so
and
now
thou
shalt
bitterly
repent
thy
insolent
behaviour
and
to
me
shalt
thou
cry
aloud
in
thy
woe
for
mercy
thou
shalt
beg
for
death
yet
shalt
not
die
thou
shalt
crave
a
speedy
doom
yet
shalt
linger
on
and
on
in
burning
pain
but
i
will
laugh
at
thy
agony
and
scoff
at
thy
prayers
thou
knave
thou
seed
of
evil
who
hath
sought
to
steal
the
favours
of
the
woman
i
desired
you
speak
the
words
of
a
coward
strike
off
these
cursed
chains
i
say
you
lying
scoundrel
and
let
fair
combat
decide
between
us
i
fear
no
braggart
such
as
you
who
can
only
heap
insults
upon
a
fettered
and
a
helpless
man
strike
off
these
chains
i
say
and
then
hold
thy
peace
or
i
will
have
thy
noisy
tongue
cut
out
perodii
answered
stung
by
graham
bitter
words
back
to
edos
shalt
thou
go
and
the
lake
of
melag
shall
be
a
couch
of
flowers
compared
with
the
bed
of
thorny
agony
on
which
thou
now
shalt
slowly
die
perodii
hates
thee
and
take
heed
of
what
thou
sayest

thee
for
thy
cursed
interference
with

evil
upon
at
least
one

already

for
thee
said
perodii
starting
to
his
feet
in
rage
and
half
drawing
the
heavy
knife
which
hung
sheathed
from
his
girdle
my
words
are
true
as
you
will
know
continued
graham
his
voice
getting
louder
as
he
went
on
volinè

mine
coward
do
you
hear
me

mine
behold
this
ring
her
ring
upon
my
finger
a
pledge
and
token
of
her
love
and
a
talisman
to
preserve
its
wearer
from
a
violent
death
and
as
he
spoke
he
held
out
his
fettered
hand
in
triumph
to
show
his
treasured
gift
then
when
she
weds
thee
she
shall
have
a
corpse
for
her
groom
ha
ha
methinks
volinè
much
as
thou
sayest
she
loves
thee
will
shun
thee
in
death
death
is
but
a
sorry
mate
upon
a
bridal
couch
your
threats
are
but
empty
words
my
comrades
lives
and
my
own
are
in
the
king
keeping
he
speaks
and
we
may
die
he
says
the
word
and
we
go
free
already
echri
displeasure
has
been
shown
by
our
miraculous
escape
from
remagaloth
the
king
yea
even
the
king
will
not
tempt
his
holy
wrath
a
second
time
for
little
i
would
strip
this
ring
from
off
thy
hand
you
dare
not
know
you
not
that
he
who
seeks
to
take
it
by
force
or
by
stealth
is
cursed
and
braver
men
than
you
would
hesitate
before
risking
their
souls
damnation
said
graham
calmly
faugh
i
want
not
thy
paltry
bauble
old
echri
is
but
a
comforter
and
turns
their
pretty
heads
with
his
ghostly
nonsense
so
long
as
i
wear
it
perodii
it
is
beyond
your
power
to
harm
me
try
as
you
will
enough
i
forget
myself
in
holding
argument
with
such
as
thee
retorted
perodii
who
then
addressing
the
guards
standing
round
us
said
take
this
boasting
fool
from
my
presence
or
by
my
eternal
soul
i
may
repent
me
my
hatred
and
by
slaying
him
at
once
cheat
myself
of
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
his
lingering
agony
perodii
the
boasting
is
all
with
you
graham
sentence
was
never
finished
for
he
was
hurried
from
the
tent
at
once
and
we
quickly
followed
surrounded
by
guards
graham
was
manacled
heavier
than
the
rest
of
us
stooping
under
the
weight
of
his
brazen
fetters
and
was
confined
by
himself
in
the
watchful
keeping
of
a
double
guard
that
night
we
were
taken
some
distance
across
country
perhaps
thirty
miles
until
we
reached
a
large
building
standing
by
itself
on
an
open
plain
in
this
was
a
deep
shaft
which
we
descended
by
a
winding
stair
and
there
at
the
bottom
we
found
waiting
for
us
a
curious
carriage
which
passed
through
a
tunnel
or
tube
fitting
tightly
as
a
in
a
cylinder
this
was
worked
either
by
some
system
of
pneumatics
or
by
electric
currents
we
could
not
say
which
as
our
departure
was
so
hurried
in
two
hours
as
near
as
we
could
judge
travelling
through
this
tube
at
a
speed
which
put
us
in
mind
of
the
we
reached
another
and
similar
building
and
ascending
a
spiral
stair
came
to
the
surface
to
our
utter
astonishment
we
had
reached
edos
and
were
marched
through
the
silent
deserted
streets
in
the
dead
of
night
back
to
our
old
prison
in
the
king
of
palace
chapter
xvi
volinè
heavily
chained
and
without
food
we
were
left
in
our
old
quarters
until
morning
not
even
the
benefit
of
a
light
being
vouchsafed
to
us
for
this
harsh
treatment
we
had
only
perodii
to
thank
indeed
it
was
highly
improbable
that
the
king
had
been
apprised
of
our
return
as
we
arrived
at
so
late
an
hour
we
passed
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
miserable
suspense
listening
to
the
regular
tramp
of
the
guards
outside
and
saying
little
to
each
other
i
hope
graham
you
now
see
the
folly
of
your
foolish
intrigue
with
this
woman
had
it
not
been
for
her
we
should
never
have
incurred
the
anger
and
the
hatred
of
this
prince
perodii
the
king
would
have
overlooked
our
killing
osa
and
we
should
now
be
free
said
the
doctor
with
more
irritation
in
his
voice
than
we
had
ever
heard
before
come
come
doctor
answered
temple
it
no
use
reproaching
graham
and
this
scoundrel
of
a
prince
perodii
may
yet
go
a
little
too
far
but
how
can
that
help
us
how
can
his
downfall
shake
off
our
fetters
how
can
his
evil
fortune
bring
our
release
from
captivity
or
save
us
from
death
continued
the
doctor
with
a
dogged
determination
to
stick
to
his
opinions
on
women
in
general
i
back
a
woman
wit
to
find
a
way
temple
went
on
dislike
for
this
perodii
and
her
partiality
for
graham
will
act
as
irresistible
incentives
to
triumph
over
the
man
she
despises
and
save
the
other
whom
she
loves
we
have
not
had
much
evidence
to
confirm
what
you
say
temple
said
the
doctor
as
obstinately
as
ever
true
answered
temple
but
you
can
not
suppose
that
this
girl
has
remained
idle
depend
upon
it
her
royal
father
has
had
to
put
up
with
a
good
deal
of
coaxing
and
entreaty
on
behalf
of
her
lover
she
will
be
sure
to
take
advantage
of
our
escape
from
remagaloth
and
make
the
most
of
her
time
unless
she
is
very
different
from
the
girls
of
earth
perodii
absence
from
edos
too
favours
her
efforts
and
she
will
have
had
a
clear
field
then
there
is
this
echri
pray
draw
the
line
at
the
supernatural
this
ring
affair
is
not
worth
serious
words
a
lot
of
humbugging
duplicity
shielded
by
religion
no
you
will
never
convince
me
temple
as
i
said
before
so
i
say
again
women
are
the
root
of
all
mischief
and
it
is
a
thousand
pities
this
volinè
ever
became
mixed
up
in
our
affairs
well
well
doctor
we
wo
argue
further
it
only
makes
unpleasantness
all
through
this
controversy
graham
never
uttered
a
word
he
sat
still
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
and
only
the
occasional
jingle
of
his
brass
fetters
told
us
that
he
was
awake
secretly
he
enjoyed
this
conversation
about
his
dear
one
it
was
untold
joy
to
him
to
be
back
again
under
the
very
roof
that
sheltered
her
to
be
so
close
to
her
and
the
hope
of
seeing
her
again
gave
him
strength
and
brightened
the
dark
hours
of
his
captivity
he
never
lost
confidence
in
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
made
him
happy
by
giving
him
her
love
and
he
knew
that
he
and
his
companions
would
neither
be
forgotten
nor
forsaken
in
their
need
he
would
not
provoke
discord
in
their
little
band
by
argument
with
his
good
and
worthy
friend
doctor
hermann
on
the
only
topic
on
which
they
were
bound
to
disagree
he
preferred
to
sit
in
silence
through
the
night
with
glad
thoughts
of
volinè
for
his
company
he
had
escaped
what
looked
like
certain
death
he
was
back
near
the
woman
who
was
to
him
the
very
garden
in
which
they
had
met
and
tasted
the
secrets
of
love
was
but
outside
the
prison
window
the
dark
hopeless
future
which
had
appeared
but
a
stormy
plain
of
wild
despair
stretching
away
away
unto
death
seemed
already
tinged
with
the
dawn
of
happiness
he
knew
volinè
ring
had
already
delivered
him
twice
from
great
peril
and
he
felt
whatever
danger
might
betide
the
secret
of
salvation
therefrom
circled
round
his
finger
a
sacred
charm
against
death
that
he
could
impart
a
little
of
this
confidence
in
the
virtues
of
his
treasure
to
his
comrades
was
his
constant
wish
not
for
his
own
sake
but
for
theirs
yet
all
that
he
could
say
had
been
already
said
the
doctor
continued
to
its
efficacy
temple
was
wont
to
smile
and
listen
half
incredulous
yet
impressed
considerably
by
his
earnestness
each
however
required
more
palpable
proof
than
that
already
given
they
forget
graham
continued
to
muse
as
he
lay
listening
to
the
doctor
and
temple
talking
that
they
are
in
a
new
world
beyond
all
earthly
influence
and
that
the
power
of
this
holy
echri
is
mysterious
and
unnatural
only
because
it
is
new
and
strange
to
us
were
it
rendered
familiar
to
us
by
earthly
custom
and
experience
we
should
look
upon
it
as
a
most
natural
thing
we
must
be
prepared
for
all
kinds
of
surprises
here
if
a
great
and
holy
man
of
this
world
possesses
a
power
which
is
invested
solely
in
god
in
our
own
why
should
we
marvel
as
he
sat
musing
thus
the
ring
upon
his
finger
suddenly
glowed
with
great
heat
and
made
him
cry
out
in
agony
why
graham
what
is
the
matter
said
all
three
of
his
companions
together
nothing
it
was
a
sudden
spasm
i
must
have
been
dreaming
i
am
all
right
i
assure
you
he
answered
resolving
to
conceal
the
actual
cause
of
his
transient
pain
it
seems
like
some
manifestation
of
echri
he
mused
well
i
believe
in
his
power
and
have
faith
in
his
ring
i
can
not
help
myself
i
am
compelled
to
do
so
then
speaking
aloud
he
continued
i
hope
you
are
not
very
greatly
inconvenienced
by
these
cursed
fetters
my
friends
the
night
is
nearly
spent
and
i
hope
daylight
will
bring
release
graham
ha
ye
no
chance
o
breakin
awa
said
sandy
these
chains
are
uncommon
heavy
and
tiresome
none
this
time
sandy
i
do
feel
up
to
it
besides
they
are
stronger
than
they
were
before
be
patient
till
the
morning
and
then
we
shall
see
what
turns
up
something
good
i
hope
for
all
our
sakes
beyond
a
word
or
two
of
enquiry
first
from
one
and
then
from
another
as
to
how
each
was
bearing
up
in
misfortune
the
remainder
of
the
night
was
passed
in
silence
sometimes
we
dozed
and
woke
again
with
a
start
of
alarm
wondering
where
we
were
then
we
lay
and
listened
to
the
guards
pacing
to
and
fro
outside
our
door
or
the
noise
of
the
distant
fountains
in
the
garden
of
siccoth
the
time
passed
slowly
enough
and
by
the
dawn
we
felt
terribly
cramped
and
sore
owing
to
our
being
compelled
to
remain
almost
in
one
position
the
livelong
night
the
sun
had
been
up
several
hours
before
our
prison
door
was
opened
and
food
brought
to
us
perodii
came
with
the
guards
and
was
again
most
insulting
in
his
language
let
loose
these
dogs
of
ramos
for
a
little
season
until
they
have
eaten
he
commenced
addressing
the
guards
standing
at
the
door
then
turning
to
us
he
exclaimed
perodii

ye
have
all
passed
a
pleasant
night
they
sleep
safely
who
repose
in
chains
now
up
and
to
your

but
methinks
ye
will
not
find
them
such
dainty
fare
as
when
the
traitor
kaosp
provided
them
by
my
soul
we
will
have
no
more
of
such
nonsense
prisoners
ye
are
and
as
prisoners
shall
ye
be
treated
so
long
as
perodii

the
charge
of
ye
and
hark

no
more

that
wanton
wench

that
forn
perodii
how
darest
thou
utter
such
words
concerning
me
the
daughter
of
thy
king
said
volinè
and
she
pushed
the
trembling
guards
aside
and
walked
into
the
room
her
cheeks
scarlet
with
burning
indignation
her
eyes
aflame
with
anger
and
her
hands
clenched
tightly
to
control
her
passion
what
doest
thou
here
volinè
exclaimed
perodii
starting
violently
and
evidently
ill
at
ease
but
preserving
with
a
mighty
effort
his
usual
air
of
bravado
meddle
not
with
my
affairs
or
by
the

to
set
these
prisoners
free
and
to

as

perodii
beside
himself
with
passion

volinè
even
as
we
obey
the
king
said
their
captain
leading
forward
his
men
and
in
a
moment
our
fetters
were
struck
off
and
we
were
free
perodii
without
another
word
walked
away
his
face
livid
with
rage
and
hatred
that
mon
bears
us
na
graham
muttered
sandy
as
we
watched
the
discomfited
prince
hurry
away
our
lives
had
been
full
of
eventful
surprises
from
the
moment
that
we
had
descended
upon
the
surface
of
this
strange
world
and
this
last
unexpected
change
in
our
fortunes
seemed
one
of
the
most
wonderful
of
all
as
yet
volinè
had
not
addressed
a
single
syllable
to
any
one
of
us
but
a
smile
of
ineffable
sweetness
stole
over
her
handsome
face
and
blushes
like
as
the
tints
of
an
opening
rose
glowed
all
unbidden
on
her
cheeks
as
she
glanced
at
graham
for
an
instant
and
met
the
look
of
admiration
and
pleasure
with
which
he
was
lovingly
regarding
her
her
his
dear
one
from
whom
he
had
been
ruthlessly
torn
asunder
and
had
now
rejoined
good
himos
thyself
and
thy
comrades
may
now
depart
said
volinè
addressing
the
captain
of
the
guard
i
will
myself
conduct
these
men
of
ramos
to
my
father
presence
thou
hast
nought
to
fear
from
thy
disobedience
of
perodii
from
this
hour
must
thou
cease
to
take
commands
from
him
until
such
time
as
it
may
be
the
king
thy
master
pleasure
to
order
otherwise
bowing
low
himos
gave
the
word
to
his
troops
who
marched
away
led
by
him
from
our
along
the
corridor
but
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
taken
by
perodii
volinè
then
advanced
towards
us
with
hands
held
out
in
welcome
and
smiling
sweetly
said
in
a
voice
from
time
to
time
trembling
with
emotion
men
of
ramos
no
words
that
i
can
speak
can
say
the
sorrow
that
i
feel
for
all
the
indignities
and
hardships
ye
have
suffered
since
entering
our
royal
city
edos
my
soul
doth
grieve
within
me
at
your
unjust
treatment
from
the
hands
of
the
king
my
father
but
his
mind
hath
been
poisoned
and
biassed
against
ye
by
him
who
brought
ye
here
in
chains
and
sought
your
ruin
to
gratify
his
own
feelings
of
revenge
since
ye
were
so
miraculously
delivered
from
death
at
the
crag
remagaloth
the
king
hath
doubted
the
wisdom
of
his
judgment
on
ye
and
ye
would
at
least
have
been
free
to
go
your
way
unmolested
had
not
perodii
prevailed
upon
the
king
to
be
allowed
to
take
ye
captives
to
bring
ye
here
again
and
then
to
carry
out
the
awful
sentence
of
the
supreme
court
himself
so
far
hath
he
been
favoured
but
his
villainy
is
now
unmasked
wiser
counsel
hath
prevailed
with
the
king
in
bestowing
upon
ye
o
distinguished
and
learned
strangers
from
ramos
his
royal
pardon
he
offers
ye
his
hospitality
and
protection
so
long
as
ye
may
make
this
our
world
your
home
but
come
now
with
me
to
his
royal
presence
and
hear
words
of
welcome
and
of
freedom
from
his
own
lips
he
waiteth
to
break
his
morning
bread
with
ye
stay
thee
no
thanks
are
asked
or
needed
continued
volinè
with
upraised
finger
as
temple
began
to
speak
for
methinks
it
is
i
that
have
brought
much
trouble
on
ye
besides
ye
must
be
full
of
weariness
and
hunger
and
it
is
not
fitting
or
seemly
that
i
should
keep
ye
longer
here
and
as
she
spoke
volinè
placed
a
tiny
whistle
wrought
in
fine
gold
and
set
with
gems
between
her
lips
and
blew
three
times
short
and
shrill
thereon
in
a
few
moments
two
dressed
in
quaint
and
costly
garb
and
with
long
white
wands
tipped
with
crescents
of
crystal
appeared
together
with
four
of
volinè
female
attendants
and
stood
in
respectful
silence
by
the
doorway
bowing
low
as
the
king
fair
daughter
passed
out
beckoning
us
to
follow
her
we
hear
from
this
volinè
only
a
few
fragments
of
the
reason
for
this
change
of
opinion
in
our
favour
she
has
left
much
more
untold
whispered
the
doctor
to
temple
as
they
walked
along
side
by
side
behind
the
marshals
true
doctor
answered
temple
in
an
undertone
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
royal
maid
has
been
pleading
our
cause
with
her
old
father
and
that
her
strong
attachment
to
graham
has
lent
eloquence
to
her
oratory
the
complete
story
of
our
pardon
is
reserved
for
his
lucky
ear
alone
say
unlucky
most
unlucky
temple
for
that
woman
toils
are
creeping
round
him
and
too
late
he
will
feel
them
hampering
his
ambition
and
retarding
his
progress
doctor
i
must
really
give
you
up
as
an
incurable
your
ideas
on
women
are
out
of
all
focus
still
you
must
admit
that
a
woman
has
rescued
us
from
a
terrible
position
into
which
she
alone
plunged
us
no
no
temple
we
shall
never
agree
upon
it
never
and
he
relapsed
into
silence
for
the
rest
of
the
way
we
walked
along
corridor
after
corridor
through
lofty
halls
and
up
and
down
wide
staircases
crammed
full
of
curious
and
costly
gems
of
art
until
it
seemed
as
though
the
colossal
palace
was
an
endless
maze
of
enchantment
and
voluptuous
grandeur
at
the
foot
of
the
last
staircase
volinè
and
her
maidens
passed
away
through
a
lofty
archway
on
the
right
waving
us
a
smiling
farewell
as
she
went
and
we
continued
to
follow
the
two
marshals
alone
at
the
top
of
this
last
flight
of
stairs
we
reached
another
archway
hung
with
soft
and
heavy
draperies
on
either
side
of
which
stood
a
guard
so
still
and
inanimate
that
he
looked
carved
out
of
the
stone
itself
as
we
crossed
the
twenty
paces
or
so
of
the
landing
these
soldiers
with
a
common
impulse
flung
the
curtains
wide
apart
and
we
passed
through
into
a
magnificent
the
scene
before
us
dazzled
us
with
its
splendour
we
had
thought
to
meet
the
king
alone
perhaps
with
his
daughter
but
instead
we
saw
him
sitting
at
the
head
of
a
table
round
which
a
hundred
male
guests
were
also
seated
to
whom
a
sumptuous
feast
was
evidently
about
to
be
served
five
vacant
seats
two
on
one
and
three
on
the
other
side
of
the
king
were
empty
and
to
these
all
and
grimy
from
the
fight
in
the
cave
we
were
conducted
men
of
ramos
we
meet
more
happily
than
we
parted
welcome
to
our
morning
feast
eat
and
refresh
yourselves
and
having
done
so
we
may
then
speak
together
said
the
king
bowing
and
smiling
graciously
we
each
kept
silence
but
acknowledged
the
old
king
cordial
greeting
with
a
respectful
bow
then
the
meal
commenced
and
was
continued
in
solemn
silence
course
after
course
until
the
last
dishes
had
been
removed
and
huge
bowls
of
liquid
had
been
placed
upon
the
table
now
the
attendants
withdrew
and
shortly
afterwards
from
some
hidden
chamber
strains
of
sweet
ravishing
music
poured
in
subtle
cadence
and
women
voices
were
heard
singing
a
dreamy
madrigal
then
came
a
solo
in
a
woman
voice
more
entrancingly
beautiful
than
all
the
rest
rising
and
falling
in
matchless
compass
a
song
that
had
for
its
theme
the
birth
and
trials
and
triumph
of
love
was
this
last
sweet
hidden
singer
volinè
and
did
she
sing
the
story
of
her
own
tender
passion
one
of
us
at
least
was
certain
that
the
voice
he
heard
was
that
of
his
beloved
and
the
words
that
wandered
through
the
like
a
hymn
from
paradise
were
addressed
to
him
stirred
to
his
soul
depth
he
listened
entranced
with
throbbing
pulses
to
the
message
that
was
sung
to
him
by
a
woman
who
was
fashioned
fairer
than
the
cunningest
conception
of
earthly
man
could
picture
at
last
the
music
ceased
the
singer
voice
was
hushed
and
amidst
a
silence
which
held
the
assembled
guests
in
thrall
the
king
addressed
us
strangers
from
the
ramos
having
now
broken
your
fast
it
is
my
duty
here
in
the
presence
of
my
faithful
ministers
of
state
to
explain
to
ye
the
reason
of
your
welcome
here
as
free
men
and
honoured
guests
all
the
terrible
indictment
against
ye
with
the
exception
of
the
killing
of
osa
hath
been
proved
to
be
false
i
am
satisfied
that
my
daughter
honour
and
fair
fame
are
as
untarnished
now
as
before
ye
came
to
edos
and
that
a
noble
of
our
court
by
name
perodii
hath
lied
the
high
priest
echri
hath
also
spoken
favourably
of
ye
and
your
cause
hath
been
ably
pleaded
by
the
wise
men
that
dwell
in
our
good
city
helmath
my
philosophers
are
learned
in
the
science
of
the
heavens
and
they
have
said
that
the
wondrous
tale
ye
tell
bears
stamp
of
truth
and
none
of
sorcery
that
being
so
we
grant
our
royal
pardon
for
the
slaying
of
our
subject
osa
believing
that
as
ye
have
already
said
he
brought
his
fate
upon
himself
and
in
expressing
our
sorrow
for
the
great
misery
and
hardships
we
have
caused
ye
we
welcome
ye
as
friends
and
brothers
and
bid
you
remain
in
edos
as
our
guests
so
long
as
ye
may
have
the
wish
we
regret
we
did
not
heed
the
words
of
the
men
of
helmath
sooner
but
perodii
cunning
made
us
ignore
their
counsel
and
nought
can
kindle
a
father
wrath
so
readily
or
feed
its
flame
so
well
and
warp
his
judgment
as
the
dishonour
of
his
child
perodii
guilt
was
only
proved
to
me
at
yesternight
hence
his
treatment
of
ye
he
now
is
deep
in
our
displeasure
and
his
seat
at
our
royal
board
is
empty
ye
need
fear
him
no
more
our
heralds
shall
proclaim
your
pardon
and
your
entrance
into
royal
favour
throughout
all
edos
and
then
may
ye
wander
in
safety
at
your
will
my
comrades
and
myself
rejoice
heartily
at
the
words
you
have
spoken
o
king
of
gathma
said
the
doctor
let
peace
and
unity
prevail
between
us
so
that
we
may
labour
for
the
common
weal
of
the
children
of
your
world
and
of
ours
glorious
possibilities
are
before
us
and
that
the
intercourse
between
the
peoples
of
two
when
once
fairly
established
may
bring
forth
nothing
but
good
i
feel
sure
will
be
echoed
as
heartily
by
your
majesty
and
your
people
as
by
my
companions
and
myself
we
thank
you
king
of
gathma
for
your
clemency
and
for
the
friendly
sentiments
you
have
just
expressed
and
will
do
our
best
ever
to
merit
your
friendship
your
protection
and
your
hospitality
the
doctor
words
were
received
with
a
salvo
of
applause
from
the
brilliant
gathering
around
us
and
shortly
afterwards
the
king
left
his
seat
saying
as
he
retired
followed
by
his
court
that
he
would
meet
us
again
in
a
few
hours
after
the
business
of
state
was
over
as
soon
as
the
king
and
his
ministers
had
gone
servants
arrived
and
conducted
us
to
a
suite
of
luxuriously
fitted
baths
where
we
made
ourselves
more
presentable
fortunately
each
had
donned
an
entirely
new
outfit
before
we
deserted
the
so
that
our
task
was
by
no
means
a
difficult
one
we
were
discussing
our
altered
fortunes
after
completing
our
toilet
when
a
marshal
entered
and
walking
up
to
graham
said
with
a
low
bow
art
thou
harry
graham
i
am
what
is
your
pleasure
he
answered
then
volinè
would
see
thee
follow
me
and
i
will
show
thee
to
my
mistress
go
and
enjoy
your
happiness
said
temple
in
english
but
the
doctor
muttered
something
by
no
means
complimentary
to
volinè
graham
was
too
full
of
joy
to
feel
angry
with
his
old
and
eccentric
friend
and
thanking
temple
for
his
good
wishes
turned
and
followed
his
conductor
once
more
he
must
furnish
this
portion
of
our
narrative
himself
leaving
the
saloon
of
baths
i
followed
my
stately
guide
along
a
wide
corridor
on
either
side
of
which
was
ranged
statuary
of
priceless
value
until
we
came
to
the
wide
staircase
up
which
we
had
passed
on
our
way
to
the
through
an
archway
at
the
foot
of
this
i
knew
the
way
led
to
volinè
apartments
at
the
bottom
of
this
spacious
stairway
we
met
two
of
volinè
maids
and
here
the
marshal
bowed
and
left
me
these
maidens
then
stepped
forward
and
each
taking
one
of
my
hands
they
bade
me
come
with
them
and
so
i
was
led
into
volinè
presence
i
found
my
darling
in
a
magnificent
chamber
where
every
luxury
that
art
and
ingenuity
could
devise
assisted
in
making
the
whole
harmonious
and
splendid
she
was
reclining
on
a
low
couch
draped
with
rich
dark
furs
of
silky
softness
her
flossy
hair
falling
all
free
and
unrestrained
around
her
bust
and
shoulders
one
shapely
arm
resting
along
the
back
of
the
couch
the
other
pillowing
her
lovely
head
what
incarnation
of
female
beauty
was
my
single
thought
as
i
beheld
her
there
in
all
her
splendour
and
for
a
moment
i
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
her
room
between
my
maiden
guides
dazzled
and
bewildered
by
the
vision
of
perfectness
before
me
with
a
smile
for
which
any
man
would
cheerfully
have
sold
his
soul
she
rose
into
a
sitting
posture
saying
thou
and
thy
sister
may
now
leave
neither
of
us
spoke
nor
moved
further
until
the
two
maids
had
gone
leaving
me
standing
as
in
a
dream
watching
the
sweet
picture
before
me
then
volinè
rose
to
her
feet
and
with
smiles
and
blushes
lending
an
added
charm
to
her
countenance
came
towards
me
murmuring
my
name
the
spell
was
broken
and
oblivious
to
aught
else
i
ran
forward
and
clasped
her
in
my
arms
again
volinè
volinè
my
darling
this
is
rapture
indeed
how
good
of
you
to
send
for
me
thus
do
i
feel
to
have
thee
with
me
again
she
answered
as
her
head
sank
nestling
on
my
breast
we
kissed
each
other
lips
and
together
we
drank
the
cup
of
our
joy
to
the
dregs
in
one
long
intoxicating
draught
without
a
single
drop
of
bitterness
to
taint
its
sweetness
but
why
dwell
on
the
ecstasy
of
our
embrace
and
of
our
meeting
after
so
much
terrible
sorrow
i
led
her
unresistingly
to
the
couch
she
had
so
lately
left
arranged
the
fallen
furs
around
her
and
sat
me
down
by
her
side
there
with
one
arm
around
her
waist
and
with
my
eyes
feasting
upon
the
beauty
of
her
face
and
form
we
conversed
of
all
that
had
befallen
us
since
last
we
talked
together
and
parted
in
the
garden
siccoth
on
that
dreadful
night
before
remagaloth
we
talked
those
lovers
trifles
so
sweet
and
apt
when
spoken
yet
so
cold
and
passionless
and
uninteresting
when
read
by
others
unconcerned
then
volinè
told
me
of
all
that
had
happened
on
the
night
we
parted
as
we
thought
for
ever
how
all
her
efforts
were
in
vain
how
she
had
visited
echri
and
been
comforted
in
her
despair
how
he
had
promised
to
intercede
with
the
king
how
he
came
too
late
and
how
she
spent
the
time
that
we
were
at
remagaloth
praying
fervently
for
our
salvation
she
told
me
of
her
joy
when
the
news
of
our
wondrous
escape
was
brought
to
edos
of
echri
visit
to
the
king
and
of
how
the
high
and
mighty
priest
had
exerted
his
power
and
delivered
us
from
an
unrighteous
doom
since
then
dear
harry
she
told
me
amidst
sobs
and
smiles
i
pleaded
thy
cause
with
my
father
beseeching
him
to
spare
thee
and
thy
companions
to
discredit
perodii
words
and
to
lend
ear
to
the
utterances
of
the
great
and
good
echri
and
the
men
of
helmath
i
besought
him
to
let
ye
go
your
way
in
peace
and
not
to
cherish
feelings
of
revenge
and
hatred
unworthy
of
a
mighty
king
but
all
i
could
say
availed
me
nothing
definite
he
felt
keenly
the
disgrace
and
humiliation
in
the
hall
of
justice
and
his
heart
was
still
hardened
towards
ye
although
i
could
perceive
his
mind
was
wavering
until
driven
to
desperation
i
told
my
father
the
naked
truth
what
may
that
truth
have
been
darling
i
whispered
seeing
her
hesitate
with
heart
beating
fast
within
me
and
with
the
hope
that
she
had
told
the
king
of
her
love
for
me
and
that
royal
favour
had
smiled
upon
my
suit
thou
press
me
to
answer
harry
i
do
my
bonny
one
mayhap
my
words
will
cause
thee
pain
more
than
the
suspense
and
anxiety
i
now
suffer
until
i
hear
them
sweet
one
i
answered
with
faltering
hope
dreading
yet
eager
to
hear
her
reply
hearken
to
my
words
and
interrupt
me
not
until
i
have
told
thee
all
i
doubt
me
not
that
thou
hast
remembrance
of
perodii
conduct
in
siccoth
and
of
the
lying
words
he
then
did
speak
from
that
night
until
the
day
of
thy
trial
and
sentence
he
used
his
knowledge
of
our
stolen
interview
as
a
power
of
evil
and
annoyance
against
me
his
threats
to
make
my
honour
the
common
gossip
of
the
streets
of
edos
bound
my
tongue
to
silence
for
we
women
of
gathma
dread
to
have
our
fame
tossed
to
and
fro
upon
the
breath
of
scandal
and
so
he
forced
his
unwelcome
attentions
upon
me
i
bore
them
harry
for
thy
sake
for
he
gave
me
solemn
assurance
that
my
meeting
with
thee
should
be
told
to
no
man
and
that
he
would
seek
to
save
thee
by
the
interrupt
me
not
harry
she
continued
placing
a
finger
on
my
lips
knowest
how
he
broke
faith
with
me
and
lied
before
my
father
and
a
hundred
thousand
dwellers
of
edos
and
what
woe
his
words
have
wrought
he
lied
because
his
passion
found
no
favour
in
my
sight
and
because
the
king
seemed
in
clement
mood
towards
ye
and
well
dost
thou
know
the
evil
of
his
words
i
told
thee
of
my
wrath
and
how
he
heard
me
without
relenting
when
last
i
met
thee
in
the
garden
after
thy
trial
and
sentence
perodii
sought
by
threats
to
make
me
yield
unto
his
wish
and
mate
with
him
but
rather
would
i
spill
mine
own
blood
than
be
his
wife
he
even
dared
to
attack
me
yet
a
second
time
on
the
night
of
thy
escape
from
remagaloth
and
by
cunning
artifice
entered
my
chamber
where
i
prayed
for
thee
cyni
by
great
good
fortune
chanced
to
be
with
me
the
living
god
volinè
perodii
shall
answer
to
me
for
this
i
said
in
a
voice
that
echoed
the
anger
and
hatred
burning
in
my
soul
and
hear
me
on
i
have
but
little
else
to
tell
thee
seeing
that
he
had
been
witnessed
by
cyni
he
sped
away
telling
me
that
he
was
starting
from
edos
that
night
to
take
thee
prisoner
again
and
carry
out
himself
the
sentence
that
had
been
pronounced
upon
thee
i
held
my
peace
hoping
that
some
evil
might
overtake
this
perodii
in
his
search
and
praying
that
his
quest
might
be
vain
until
i
heard
from
a
hunter
noble
by
name
kios
that
ye
had
struggled
valiantly
near
helmath
yet
had
been
overcome
and
were
being
carried
back
to
edos
then
i
told
my
father
all
and
proved
my
words
by
good
cyni
aid
great
was
his
wrath
at
the
manner
in
which
perodii
had
duped
him
and
quickly
did
he
take
steps
to
protect
and
befriend
ye
as
ye
have
already
seen
why
not
have
told
your
father
all
this
long
ago
darling
father
hath
many
cares
and
much
business
of
state
to
do
and
i
did
not
like
to
add
to
his
troubles
this
perodii
what
punishment
will
be
meted
out
to
him
surely
he
merits
death
for
so
insulting
the
daughter
of
his
king
our
laws
are
not
thy
laws
our
customs
in
gathma
are
not
like
those
in
ramos
earth
as
it
is
called
by
thee
know
thee
that
even
the
king
hath
no
power
to
put
to
death
a
noble
of
perodii
rank
he
can
but
depose
him
from
court
kios
whom
we
met
near
the
city
of
pamax
told
us
that
for
some
offence
he
had
been
condemned
to
die
and
only
saved
his
life
through
the
clemency
of
the
king
i
also
heard
yesterday
from
worthy
kios
of
your
stay
with
him
in
the
woods
of
theloth
and
wish
him
well
but
kios
was
not
of
such
noble
rank
as
perodii
who
in
station
is
next
to
the
king
shall
not
prevent
his
reckoning
with
me
volinè
the
day
shall
yet
come
when
i
will
make
him
confess
as
publicly
that
his
words
were
lies
as
when
he
spoke
them
in
your
father
judgment
hall
him
not
o
harry
let
him
go
his
own
evil
way
cross
not
his
path
a
second
time
or
he
may
do
thee
harm
and
i
what
dear
one
i
asked
as
i
kissed
her
forehead
never
cease
to
grieve
for
thee
she
answered
nestling
closer
to
me
and
gazing
into
my
face
with
her
splendid
eyes
i
have
no
fear
of
such
a
coward
as
he
and
by
the
customs
of
the
earth
i
long
have
left
i
swear
he
shall
answer
for
his
added
insults
on
you
harry
dost
thou
not
care
for
me
enough
to
obey
me
thou
dost
then
let
perodii
rest
in
the
deep
disgrace
into
which
he
hath
already
fallen
by
the
customs
of
edos
methinks
no
greater
punishment
could
be
given
him
and
now
thou
must
leave
me
when
may
i
see
you
again
darling
yes
say
and
in
the
garden
siccoth
by
the
arbour
where
you
first
met
me
thou
hast
my
promise
now
haste
thee
to
thy
comrades
for
the
hour
hath
arrived
when
my
maids
do
come
to
me
the
hour
soon
come
my
darling
when
we
shall
never
have
to
part
again
i
said
to
her
unable
longer
to
control
my
feelings
meanest
thou
will
tell
you
my
precious
one
in
siccoth
arbour
where
at
sunset
i
shall
wait
in
weariness
until
you
come
i
answered
as
i
kissed
her
again
and
again
before
tearing
myself
away
from
her
white
encircling
arms
once
more
three
blasts
were
blown
by
volinè
upon
that
golden
whistle
and
almost
immediately
cyni
and
her
sister
entered
and
conducted
me
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
where
i
found
the
marshal
waiting
to
escort
me
back
to
my
companions
i
found
them
in
one
of
the
smaller
rooms
of
the
palace
happy
enough
and
full
of
what
they
had
been
doing
during
the
morning
that
i
had
spent
with
volinè
temple
had
been
amusing
himself
in
wandering
from
room
to
room
of
this
wonderful
palace
passing
his
time
in
admiring
the
costly
and
beautiful
works
which
adorned
its
interior
all
of
them
new
and
strange
and
like
nothing
to
be
found
in
the
palaces
of
earth
the
doctor
and
sandy
had
walked
abroad
into
the
streets
and
squares
of
edos
and
were
full
of
the
curious
scenes
and
customs
they
had
witnessed
and
the
strange
types
of
architecture
they
had
seen
everywhere
they
had
been
treated
with
respect
although
much
curiosity
was
excited
by
their
appearance
and
movements
i
was
just
telling
temple
that
edos
would
scarcely
suit
a
man
of
his
commercial
instincts
remarked
the
doctor
to
graham
as
he
entered
the
room
the
doctor
had
quite
recovered
his
good
temper
and
the
walk
abroad
had
put
him
in
the
best
of
spirits
what
do
you
think
of
a
city
where
there
are
no
shops
nor
marts
of
business
edos
is
a
centre
of
luxury
a
of
the
noble
and
those
of
high
degree
none
of
its
inhabitants
toil
or
trade
therein
it
is
an
ideal
city
smokeless
noiseless
a
repository
for
the
best
and
brightest
results
of
the
brain
and
genius
of
a
world
and
a
for
its
cultured
people
continued
the
doctor
led
away
by
his
enthusiasm
i
want
a
hundred
hands
graham
to
chronicle
all
i
have
seen
my
one
regret
is
that
my
life
will
not
be
long
enough
to
do
justice
to
this
glorious
world
or
to
describe
its
endless
wonders
and
so
the
afternoon
slipped
away
in
pleasant
entertaining
chat
varied
by
a
light
meal
which
was
served
to
us
by
two
of
the
palace
servants
in
the
early
evening
the
doctor
temple
and
graham
dined
with
the
king
another
sumptuous
feast
at
which
the
old
monarch
made
himself
especially
agreeable
and
never
seemed
to
tire
of
hearing
us
recount
our
journey
across
the
heavens
and
tell
of
the
world
we
had
left
curiously
enough
no
ladies
were
numbered
among
the
guests
but
this
and
the
morning
feast
we
learned
afterwards
were
state
banquets
at
which
it
is
not
etiquette
for
females
to
appear
graham
unknown
of
course
to
all
the
rest
chafed
exceedingly
under
the
long
and
almost
endless
interrogations
of
the
king
for
he
thought
of
the
tryst
he
had
to
keep
with
volinè
already
the
sun
was
sinking
low
in
the
western
sky
and
he
was
all
impatience
to
hasten
away
at
last
the
meal
was
finished
and
the
brilliant
gathering
of
nobles
and
ministers
rose
from
the
table
and
separated
into
groups
to
carry
on
a
friendly
conversation
in
the
confusion
graham
managed
to
slip
away
unobserved
but
took
temple
into
his
confidence
before
doing
so
who
promised
to
make
excuses
for
him
if
his
absence
chanced
to
be
noticed
by
the
king
i
left
the
just
as
the
king
and
the
doctor
were
eagerly
engaged
in
a
discussion
upon
the
civilised
forms
of
government
on
earth
slipping
out
unperceived
and
hurrying
along
the
corridor
towards
the
staircase
that
led
down
to
a
lower
corridor
to
which
i
knew
there
was
an
entrance
to
the
garden
of
i
was
just
about
to
open
this
door
stooping
down
to
examine
the
fastening
thereof
when
the
hated
voice
of
my
rival
perodii
hissed
into
my
ear
the
following
words
of
evil
we
meet
again
how
often
more
art
thou
going
to
cross
my
path
and
live
beware
or
by
my
eternal
soul
i
will
slay
thee
even
here
perodii
i
desire
to
have
no
further
intercourse
with
you
and
i
waste
precious
time
in
answering
your
vulgar
words
so
that
wanton
wench
volinè
waits
thee
my
curse
upon
her
for
meddling
perodii
never
finished
his
sentence
for
without
thinking
of
the
consequences
of
my
act
and
forgetting
in
my
passion
what
i
had
promised
volinè
i
gave
the
prince
a
stunning
blow
full
in
the
face
with
my
clenched
hand
and
sent
him
reeling
to
the
ground
that
and
may
it
teach
you
better
manners
i
said
as
i
delivered
the
blow
straight
from
my
shoulder
hark
you
i
continued
as
he
lay
upon
the
mosaic
floor
you
ever
dare
to
speak
one
more
insulting
word
in
my
hearing
about
the
woman
i
love
may
your
worthless
blood
be
upon
your
own
head
for
i
will
slay
you
as
i
would
a
brute
beast
the
prince
by
this
time
had
recovered
his
feet
and
stood
mad
with
pain
and
rage
half
blinded
by
the
blow
i
had
dealt
him
and
unsheathing
the
long
knife
that
dangled
in
a
jewelled
scabbard
from
his
waist
what
the
end
would
have
been
it
is
difficult
to
conjecture
but
at
that
moment
our
good
friend
himos
came
along
with
a
posse
of
troops
at
sight
of
whom
perodii
sheathed
his
weapon
and
walked
away
saying
as
he
did
so
hour
of
my
revenge
is
yet
again
delayed
but
i
will
wait
aye
wait
for
centuries
yet
to
come
if
need
be
and
wipe
out
all
thy
insults
in
thy
blood
nodding
to
himos
i
sped
through
the
doorway
into
the
garden
and
hurried
along
between
the
rows
of
curious
shrubs
and
flowers
towards
the
arbour
where
volinè
had
promised
to
meet
me
already
the
sun
was
dipping
behind
the
distant
hills
and
i
feared
that
my
darling
might
have
come
and
not
finding
me
there
had
gone
away
again
the
arbour
was
empty
and
just
as
i
saw
it
on
that
fateful
night
that
seemed
already
sunless
ages
gone
i
sat
me
down
on
the
seat
where
we
had
embraced
then
i
walked
to
and
fro
along
the
path
that
her
dear
feet
had
trod
scarcely
able
to
control
my
impatience
as
the
day
fell
slowly
into
night
and
volinè
came
not
had
harm
befallen
her
then
terrible
thoughts
of
perodii
mad
vengeance
floated
through
my
brain
and
i
cursed
myself
for
not
killing
him
outright
and
thus
preventing
him
from
working
her
evil
at
last
my
ear
caught
footsteps
sounding
on
the
pathway
clearer
and
clearer
in
the
still
evening
air
then
she
for
whom
i
waited
came
from
out
of
the
shadows
towards
me
and
in
another
moment
my
sorrow
was
changed
to
joy
as
i
folded
her
in
my
arms
fear
i
have
kept
thee
waiting
but
a
disturbance
in
the
palace
has
caused
me
delay
perodii
hath
lodged
complaint
against
thee
for
striking
him
without
cause
and
my
father
is
annoyed
and
angry
that
such
a
vulgar
fray
should
have
taken
place
under
his
roof
perodii
now
hath
no
business
within
our
royal
house
and
my
father
refused
to
hear
more
of
his
words
harry
why
didst
thou
not
keep
thy
promise
to
me
and
leave
this
man
alone
he
is
a
coward
and
a
liar
he
alone
is
in
the
wrong
and
thrust
himself
upon
me
as
i
came
hither
he
insulted
you
and
i
struck
him
to
the
ground
in
my
passion
but
i
am
sorry
now
for
i
have
offended
you
but
pardon
and
forgive
me
dear
one
and
let
nothing
come
to
mar
our
happiness
i
will
see
the
king
anon
and
tell
him
the
simple
truth
come
kiss
me
and
make
me
happy
again
dost
not
deserve
it
harry
but
there
and
as
she
kissed
me
she
continued
now
heed
my
wishes
better
in
future
or
my
forgiveness
will
be
more
slowly
given
i
promise
thee
and
so
this
little
cloud
above
our
happiness
drifted
away
and
we
enjoyed
all
the
sweets
of
each
other
company
to
the
full
i
was
determined
now
to
ask
volinè
to
be
my
wife
in
spite
of
our
differences
of
race
and
inequality
of
rank
and
station
i
resolved
to
tell
her
of
my
passion
and
to
hear
my
fate
i
whispered
as
i
drew
her
gently
and
yet
closer
to
me
do
you
not
know
that
i
love
you
more
passionately
than
ever
mortal
man
has
loved
before
do
you
not
know
that
you
have
brought
brightness
into
my
life
and
have
taken
that
place
in
my
heart
which
only
one
woman
can
ever
fill
wilt
thou
always
love
me
so
darling
always
until
the
race
of
my
life
is
run
and
all
power
of
loving
is
stayed
by
the
hand
of
death
here
in
this
arbour
i
swear
it
by
my
home
world
yonder
and
all
that
i
hold
dear
thereon
see
you
glimmering
as
a
star
above
the
in
the
southern
sky
i
pledge
to
love
and
to
worship
you
volinè
so
long
as
i
have
life
to
love
and
breath
to
speak
it
volinè
you
are
all
in
all
to
me
my
first
love
and
my
last
without
you
life
is
but
another
name
for
pain
with
you
bright
and
radiant
joy
for
ever
i
am
yours
and
you
are
mine
volinè
be
my
wife
crown
my
happiness
by
saying
yes
harry
thy
last
words
have
brought
a
strange
and
unknown
pain
to
my
heart
and
revealed
the
misery
that
is
now
before
me
whichever
way
i
answer
thee
harry
the
sweets
of
wifehood
with
thee
are
a
joy
which
i
may
never
hope
to
reach
there
is
one
barrier
that
must
ever
stand
between
us
which
maketh
impossible
a
union
between
a
son
of
thy
world
and
a
daughter
of
mine
it
hath
been
so
ordained
and
therefore
we
can
not
alter
it
to
meet
our
will
this
barrier
of
which
i
speak
is
the
span
of
life
here
as
thou
knowest
there
are
old
men
amongst
us
who
have
seen
five
hundred
summers
whiten
into
winter
four
hundred
years
are
the
men
of
gathma
usual
span
even
as
thou
hast
told
me
but
seventy
are
the
limit
of
the
men
of
earth
and
thine
i
am
but
five
and
twenty
summers
comparatively
in
childhood
yet
and
for
fifty
summers
more
i
shall
enjoy
the
sweets
of
youth
thou
art
in
the
middle
of
thy
tiny
course
and
in
a
few
more
years
will
reach
the
close
of
thy
allotted
span
think
then
of
my
time
of
endless
widowhood
sadly
mourning
for
thee
yearning
for
the
love
i
tasted
only
to
lose
were
i
to
wife
with
thee
my
short
happiness
would
ever
be
clouded
by
its
early
end
it
must
not
can
not
be
your
words
blot
out
all
brightness
from
my
heart
which
now
feels
turned
to
stone
all
now
is
dismal
woe
again
woe
without
a
ray
of
hope
and
there
is
naught
but
death
before
me
to
free
me
from
my
pain
without
you
i
can
not
will
not
live
for
life
would
be
but
a
living
death
of
dark
despair
is
there
no
hope
for
me
no
hope
volinè
dearest
am
i
but
to
review
this
promised
land
of
happiness
from
afar
off
only
to
turn
my
face
away
from
its
green
pastures
for
ever
ah
no
it
is
too
horrible
poor
harry
it
is
as
hard
for
me
as
for
thee
for
i
love
thee
as
a
woman
only
loves
when
she
doth
love
that
is
with
all
her
soul
no
hope
can
lighten
our
darkness
or
leaven
our
sorrow
yet
stay
there
is
one
way
one
only
but
alas
it
is
all
too
terrible
too
terrible
to
speak
and
here
she
burst
into
a
passionate
fit
of
sobbing
and
clung
tightly
to
me
stricken
down
with
grief
i
soothed
her
as
best
i
could
and
dried
her
hot
tears
with
my
own
parched
lips
sighs
of
agony
meanwhile
breaking
unbidden
from
my
own
heart
and
big
beads
of
sweat
rolling
off
my
forehead
like
drops
of
molten
pain
my
darling
speak
unto
me
i
implored
words
unto
your
thoughts
and
let
me
know
and
share
them
volinè
speak
or
my
heart
will
burst
with
its
heavy
weight
of
woe
then
mingled
with
her
sobs
and
moans
of
anguish
she
spoke
to
me
thus
thou
canst
purchase
happiness
but
the
price
thou
wilt
have
to
pay
is
as
costly
as
it
is
terrible
i
have
heard
that
holy
echri
hath
the
power
of
prolonging
life
of
endowing
mortal
man
with
forces
that
rejuvenate
the
ordeal
is
awful
it
is
one
of
fire
to
him
who
would
so
prolong
or
purchase
life
the
penalty
is
that
he
shall
suffer
all
the
horrors
of
death
by
fire
i
know
not
the
secrets
of
the
mystic
rite
but
i
will
question
echri
on
the
morrow
doth
it
not
seem
unholy
and
yet
and
yet
love
is
sweet
your
words
bring
new
hope
to
my
heart
if
echri
possesses
this
wondrous
power
then
will
i
prove
my
love
for
you
in
his
fires
his
furnace
shall
but
burn
the
dross
of
my
love
away
but
refine
it
into
a
yet
purer
passion
harry
how
brave
and
how
noble
thou
art
thy
calmness
gives
me
confidence
if
thou
hast
will
and
courage
to
pass
through
this
fire
for
me
then
surely
shalt
thou
be
rewarded
by
calling
me
thine
own
that
is
provided
my
father
hath
no
obstacle
to
urge
against
our
union
but
brave
one
the
hour
is
already
late
and
we
must
return
meet
me
here
even
at
setting
sun
and
i
will
bring
thee
news
from
echri
until
then
adieu
courage
volinè
my
darling
all
shall
yet
be
well
i
whispered
to
her
as
we
walked
along
the
towards
the
palace
and
then
planting
kiss
after
kiss
upon
her
willing
lips
and
snowy
brow
i
released
her
from
my
arms
and
she
went
away
love
runs
no
smoother
here
in
gathma
than
on
earth
i
mused
as
i
walked
along
the
corridors
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
past
hour
a
great
and
indefinable
awe
seemed
creeping
through
every
fibre
of
my
body
as
i
thought
and
thought
over
the
ghastly
pledge
i
had
just
given
tempted
by
the
vision
of
beauty
in
my
arms
did
i
regret
my
hasty
passionate
vow
i
now
asked
myself
in
cooler
moments
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
mentally
answered
my
own
question
for
if
the
way
to
my
own
happiness
lies
through
fire
through
fire
i
am
thoroughly
prepared
to
go
here
in
the
original
follows
a
long
account
of
a
scientific
nature
which
though
of
the
greatest
importance
to
philosophers
might
not
be
of
sufficient
interest
to
the
general
reading
public
i
have
therefore
deemed
it
expedient
to
omit
this
portion
of
the
narrative
and
keep
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
fortunes
of
harry
and
ed
chapter
xvii
at
the
temple
on
the
hill
verosi
already
my
comrades
had
retired
to
rest
and
i
did
not
see
any
of
them
until
the
morrow
each
one
of
us
had
now
a
separate
chamber
fitted
up
with
every
convenience
and
every
luxury
and
after
i
had
lightly
supped
a
martial
showed
me
to
my
own
apartment
sleep
i
could
not
the
couch
was
soft
the
surroundings
all
that
might
woo
sleep
for
any
man
but
my
eyes
refused
to
close
in
slumber
hour
after
hour
i
lay
there
awake
busy
with
thoughts
of
the
woman
i
was
about
to
espouse
and
of
the
awful
conditions
under
which
our
union
was
to
be
made
all
night
i
tossed
in
feverish
excitement
until
the
sickly
light
of
the
yellow
dawn
crept
between
the
window
draperies
then
i
rose
and
dressed
and
threw
wide
the
casement
to
let
the
refreshing
morning
air
cool
my
burning
temples
my
tongue
was
dry
and
parched
and
the
cruel
grip
of
a
deadly
fever
seemed
to
have
seized
me
then
a
terrible
dread
came
over
me
that
i
was
becoming
mad
was
i
still
on
earth
and
my
visit
to
this
strange
world
and
all
that
had
befallen
me
thereon
but
the
wild
delusion
of
a
madman
dream
i
would
seek
out
doctor
hermann
if
all
was
an
absolute
reality
tell
him
my
symptoms
and
let
him
prescribe
some
remedy
early
as
it
was
i
left
my
room
and
sought
the
doctor
for
to
stay
there
any
longer
i
felt
to
be
impossible
morning
doctor
graham
said
he
in
a
voice
mingled
with
alarm
and
sympathy
rising
from
his
couch
as
he
spoke
whatever
ails
you
is
just
what
i
came
here
to
know
doctor
i
feel
all
to
pieces
generally
out
of
sorts
and
thought
you
might
have
some
simple
remedy
at
hand
to
brace
me
up
a
bit
remedy
why
man
you
look
half
dead
come
let
me
have
a
look
at
you
your
pulse
ah
i
thought
so
you
are
exciting
yourself
too
much
over
something
or
other
you
do
want
medicine
absolute
rest
is
all
i
can
prescribe
have
you
been
to
bed
at
all
you
have
then
go
back
to
bed
again
man
doctor
i
can
not
sleep
try
as
i
will
all
night
i
have
not
closed
my
eyes
swallow
a
couple
of
those
answered
the
doctor
taking
two
tiny
pills
from
a
phial
in
his
as
he
spoke
hours
sleep
should
put
you
to
rights
and
just
one
word
of
advice
graham
do
worry
yourself
so
much
whatever
may
be
the
cause
or
you
will
be
downright
ill
there
be
off
to
bed
again
and
i
will
look
in
later
on
i
took
the
pills
and
went
back
to
my
bed
but
it
seemed
hours
and
hours
before
the
opiate
acted
and
i
sank
into
a
deep
and
dreamless
slumber
the
sun
was
low
down
in
the
western
sky
before
i
woke
again
but
the
fever
had
left
me
and
i
felt
refreshed
by
my
bedside
i
found
various
meats
and
a
tall
slender
flagon
of
but
far
more
welcome
to
my
opening
eyes
was
a
small
nosegay
of
flowers
with
a
scroll
of
paper
fastened
to
them
on
which
was
written
the
two
magic
words
volinè
from
volinè
heaven
guard
her
from
all
evil
i
dressed
in
haste
eating
as
i
did
so
for
the
hour
appointed
for
my
meeting
with
her
was
nigh
and
my
heart
was
filled
with
anxiety
for
the
news
that
she
might
bring
but
ere
i
had
time
to
leave
my
chamber
a
servant
came
leaving
a
message
from
my
darling
saying
that
she
would
see
me
in
her
apartments
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
cyni
and
her
sister
waited
my
coming
and
conducted
me
into
the
same
room
i
had
entered
before
volinè
was
waiting
for
me
and
as
the
two
handmaidens
bowed
and
left
she
came
quickly
to
my
side
a
frightened
anxious
look
clouding
her
peerless
face
is
the
matter
dear
one
i
asked
as
i
saw
her
troubled
look
although
i
guessed
the
cause
sickness
hath
grieved
me
sorely
dear
art
thou
better
now
sight
of
you
makes
illness
flee
but
my
malady
is
more
of
the
spirit
than
the
body
darling
i
can
not
sleep
for
thoughts
of
you
that
is
all
my
ailment
and
now
let
me
thank
you
and
kiss
you
for
the
pretty
flowers
see
i
wear
them
near
my
heart
and
prize
them
much
but
why
do
i
see
you
here
two
reasons
first
thou
art
not
well
enough
to
risk
the
chilly
air
of
evening
and
second
i
have
prevailed
upon
echri
to
meet
thee
here
at
a
later
hour
already
have
i
seen
him
when
he
came
to
edos
this
morning
as
is
his
daily
custom
and
by
great
good
fortune
persuaded
him
to
grant
my
prayer
oh
harry
harry
canst
thou
bear
this
pain
for
me
one
my
word
is
given
and
i
am
ready
even
now
to
pass
through
this
mystic
ceremony
if
it
but
hastens
the
day
of
our
happiness
have
you
yet
made
known
our
secret
to
the
king
no
for
i
fear
his
refusal
but
methinks
i
hadst
better
tell
him
before
echri
comes
he
may
ask
if
my
father
hath
given
his
consent
to
our
betrothal
and
even
refuse
his
aid
if
such
hath
not
been
given
darling
tell
your
father
of
our
love
and
i
took
her
in
my
arms
as
i
spoke
and
kissed
her
upturned
face
in
boundless
pride
thou
sayest
so
will
i
do
yea
even
now
shall
the
king
hear
of
my
love
for
thee
and
my
desire
to
be
thy
wife
so
speaking
volinè
withdrew
herself
from
my
arms
and
placing
the
whistle
to
her
lips
called
her
faithful
cyni
into
the
room
thy
royal
master
engaged
with
business
of
state
learn
and
tell
me
majesty
o
mistress
is
in
the
hall
of
song
so
o
mistress
then
conduct
me
to
his
presence
good
cyni
for
i
would
speak
to
him
there
and
waving
her
hand
to
me
volinè
departed
leaving
me
to
wait
by
myself
whilst
the
question
of
our
happiness
was
decided
slowly
the
moments
slipped
away
one
hour
passed
another
had
nearly
sped
and
yet
volinè
came
not
my
heart
was
filled
with
forebodings
of
evil
dread
had
seized
upon
my
soul
and
so
agitated
did
i
begin
to
feel
as
the
time
wore
on
that
i
trembled
like
an
aspen
and
my
legs
became
unable
to
bear
me
once
more
i
passed
through
untold
agonies
of
suspense
until
at
last
i
heard
volinè
voice
outside
bidding
cyni
leave
her
the
look
of
triumph
on
her
face
as
she
entered
told
me
her
story
before
she
could
speak
yet
her
flushed
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
bore
silent
witness
that
the
interview
with
the
king
her
father
had
been
by
no
means
an
unexciting
one
darling
i
read
your
secret
on
your
radiant
face
now
all
is
well
and
i
may
justly
claim
you
as
my
own
sayest
truly
my
father
hath
said
that
i
may
wed
thee
he
hath
consented
to
our
troth
and
harry
i
could
cry
with
joy
but
wilt
thou
always
love
me
as
thou
lovest
me
now
art
thou
really
sure
for
i
can
tell
thee
men
of
gathma
are
often
known
to
tire
of
their
wives
they
can
not
be
one
quarter
so
charmingly
fascinating
as
you
are
darling
flatterer
thou
seemest
to
know
the
way
to
a
woman
heart
who
hath
taught
thee
her
weakness
of
your
sex
certainly
my
sweet
one
unless
maybe
i
inherit
it
from
those
who
have
had
more
experience
but
volinè
why
stay
so
long
away
was
your
father
at
all
inclined
to
withhold
his
sanction
was
for
although
succession
to
the
crown
of
gathma
never
runs
through
female
descendants
it
was
his
wish
that
i
should
wed
a
noble
of
our
own
race
he
hath
prejudice
against
thee
for
thou
art
not
of
this
world
besides
he
also
urged
thy
short
span
of
life
that
is
easily
overcome
darling
i
urged
so
easily
as
thou
thinkest
but
i
am
not
going
to
brood
on
that
terror
at
least
not
yet
i
spoke
of
echri
power
and
of
thy
own
determination
and
that
bringeth
me
to
what
i
hadst
forgotten
in
my
joy
my
father
at
last
consented
to
my
wish
but
he
made
it
the
condition
that
thou
shouldst
pass
through
this
ordeal
of
fire
he
sayeth
that
if
thou
hast
the
courage
to
face
this
awful
trial
which
will
make
thee
more
of
gathma
than
of
ramos
then
and
then
only
art
thou
worthy
of
being
mate
for
me
you
for
my
reward
dearest
volinè
i
would
not
hesitate
to
suffer
the
pangs
of
death
a
hundred
times
i
win
your
love
in
this
ordeal
harry
thou
hast
won
it
long
ago
heaven
bless
you
for
those
precious
words
i
answered
as
i
kissed
her
flushed
cheeks
and
drew
her
head
gently
down
upon
my
shoulder
a
low
knocking
at
the
door
broke
the
spell
of
our
delicious
pleasure
and
we
heard
cyni
who
had
evidently
being
instructed
to
watch
saying
o
mistress
echri
the
priest
cometh
conduct
him
thither
cyni
with
thy
fleetest
steps
volinè
answered
seating
herself
on
a
couch
and
smoothing
her
ruffled
hair
in
a
few
moments
this
famous
priest
arrived
and
i
was
not
a
little
astonished
to
see
with
what
reverence
he
was
received
but
his
calm
saintly
dignified
bearing
seemed
imperatively
to
demand
respect
even
obeisance
never
before
had
i
seen
so
aged
a
being
or
one
whose
years
of
life
were
borne
with
so
much
vigour
and
manliness
he
came
into
volinè
room
with
a
firm
and
upright
step
his
long
hair
and
beard
which
reached
below
his
breast
white
with
the
winters
of
centuries
setting
off
a
singularly
handsome
and
intelligent
face
bareheaded
clad
in
a
long
loose
black
garment
tightened
with
a
scarlet
sash
round
his
waist
and
with
a
scroll
of
what
looked
like
parchment
in
one
hand
and
a
long
richly
ornamented
staff
in
the
other
he
advanced
towards
volinè
saying
blessing
rest
upon
thee
and
thine
volinè
daughter
of
our
king
thank
thee
holy
father
for
thy
kindly
benediction
and
also
for
showing
me
such
favour
in
coming
hither
at
so
late
an
hour
nay
child
i
am
ever
ready
to
comfort
any
sorrow
and
assist
distress
i
come
to
talk
of
thy
troubles
and
by
god
good
grace
relieve
them
thou
art
weary
good
father
and
may
not
yet
have
supped
wilt
thou
not
eat
before
thou
hast
converse
with
us
ever
gives
me
strength
unto
the
measure
of
my
labours
child
and
my
humble
fare
awaits
me
in
my
as
soon
as
the
works
of
the
day
be
done
this
stranger
here
is
the
man
of
ramos
who
was
delivered
from
thy
father
misplaced
wrath
at
remagaloth
same
o
father
see
thy
sacred
ring
is
even
now
upon
his
finger
thy
talisman
from
evil
now
most
reverend
echri
i
would
offer
you
my
gratitude
as
well
as
that
of
my
companions
for
your
timely
and
marvellous
aid
in
the
hour
of
our
darkest
need
both
there
and
in
the
chados
deserts
when
we
were
perishing
of
thirst
i
said
advancing
to
where
the
old
priest
stood
and
bowing
to
him
respectfully
ever
seek
to
help
all
who
put
their
faith
in
god
and
blindly
trust
themselves
to
his
omnipotence
but
thou
hast
come
a
long
journey
my
son
from
a
world
whose
ways
i
know
not
save
by
their
revelation
to
me
in
a
vision
therein
was
declared
unto
me
that
ye
do
worship
god
but
in
a
different
manner
from
us
of
gathma
therein
too
was
declared
unto
me
that
all
in
god
good
time
the
peoples
of
the
worlds
that
roll
across
the
sky
in
majesty
and
splendour
those
balls
that
speak
of
his
creative
wisdom
in
their
throbbing
lights
by
night
shall
be
knit
together
in
one
grand
brotherhood
of
god
this
vision
teacheth
me
that
in
thee
and
thy
companions
i
see
the
shadowed
prophecy
beginning
its
fulfilment
ye
have
conquered
space
by
your
cunning
arts
and
the
planets
now
no
longer
keep
them
to
themselves
so
will
god
gather
those
scattered
worlds
together
and
hold
all
his
people
united
and
now
volinè
tells
me
that
the
passion
ye
call
love
hath
taken
root
between
ye
and
that
already
thou
hast
asked
her
to
wife
thou
art
but
an
agent
of
god
in
this
wondrous
thing
and
being
so
it
is
my
holy
duty
to
help
thee
yet
again
in
prolonging
thy
days
so
that
they
shall
equal
hers
i
hear
that
thou
art
willing
to
go
through
the
holy
rite
that
will
endow
thee
with
a
longer
span
so
i
answered
overwhelmed
by
the
solemn
words
the
old
priest
had
uttered
hast
thou
weighed
well
thine
inclination
the
ordeal
that
thou
must
pass
is
one
of
fire
know
ye
that
fire
is
life
and
life
is
fire
by
passing
fire
ye
enter
life
but
even
so
must
death
be
conquered
first
father
i
wait
with
growing
impatience
to
so
prolong
my
days
having
all
faith
in
your
wondrous
power
to
help
me
i
answered
with
a
trembling
voice
awed
beyond
description
by
the
subtle
influence
this
old
priest
already
had
over
me
at
noon
upon
the
morrow
come
thou
to
the
temple
on
the
hill
verosi
and
there
will
i
help
thee
to
thy
wish
volinè
will
show
thee
thither
and
let
your
coming
and
your
going
be
in
secret
and
be
done
by
stealth
hither
volinè
for
i
would
give
my
blessing
to
ye
both
before
i
go
and
the
old
priest
taller
by
a
head
and
shoulders
than
i
stood
up
and
with
one
hand
placed
on
volinè
head
and
the
other
on
my
own
he
breathed
a
silent
prayer
for
us
now
my
children
i
must
get
me
gone
the
nightly
services
of
our
holy
house
upon
the
hill
await
my
ministration
and
methinks
ye
both
do
tire
of
an
old
man
company
thank
thee
much
for
thy
good
offices
holy
echri
and
will
keep
faith
with
thee
then
taking
up
his
staff
and
his
scroll
of
holy
writings
the
old
priest
with
a
smile
in
which
no
human
passions
mingled
slowly
went
his
way
harry
thou
shalt
sup
with
me
as
a
mark
of
royal
favour
said
volinè
with
a
smile
then
must
thou
go
and
rest
and
fortify
thyself
for
the
morrow
so
saying
she
led
me
into
another
and
a
smaller
room
adjoining
where
cyni
and
her
sister
irolne
waited
to
serve
us
with
food
our
meal
over
i
bade
volinè
adieu
until
the
morrow
she
promising
to
meet
me
at
our
old
tryst
in
the
garden
of
an
hour
before
noon
whence
we
might
journey
together
to
the
temple
on
the
distant
hill
of
verosi
so
the
morrow
is
to
be
the
most
eventful
day
of
all
my
eventful
life
i
mused
as
i
sat
in
my
chamber
looking
out
upon
the
palace
grounds
now
appearing
in
all
the
subtle
beauty
a
tropical
night
alone
can
lend
there
i
sat
for
an
hour
or
more
deeply
pondering
over
the
morrow
mysteries
and
what
shall
i
harry
graham
be
at
the
close
of
that
day
my
home
my
earth
shone
like
a
brilliant
in
the
southern
sky
in
a
few
hours
more
and
all
the
ties
that
bind
me
thereto
will
be
burnt
away
destroyed
by
fire
slowly
as
i
mused
her
beautiful
point
of
light
sank
lower
and
lower
and
finally
she
dropped
behind
the
and
i
bade
her
adieu
farewell
for
with
earthly
eyes
i
should
see
her
no
more
one
pang
of
regret
and
one
only
shot
through
my
heart
quicker
than
the
lightning
flash
and
was
gone
and
then
i
cursed
my
weakness
for
it
seemed
like
a
breach
of
loyalty
to
her
all
night
i
slept
but
little
and
right
glad
was
i
to
see
the
distant
mountains
through
my
eastern
window
tipped
with
ruddy
day
i
rose
up
from
my
couch
and
early
as
it
was
summoned
herio
the
servant
who
had
been
charged
with
the
duty
of
attending
to
my
personal
needs
what
hour
do
my
comrades
take
their
morning
meal
herio
i
asked
as
he
entered
hours
from
the
present
sire
you
will
find
me
if
they
make
enquiry
in
the
garden
below
i
go
there
to
breathe
the
morning
air
and
to
refresh
myself
truly
this
garden
was
a
wondrous
place
filled
with
strange
flowers
and
plants
and
trees
many
of
the
latter
festooned
together
by
creepers
which
dropped
in
blooms
of
rare
beauty
and
fragrance
it
was
graced
with
statuary
and
with
fountains
which
by
hidden
means
dispelled
a
subtle
perfume
in
their
spray
as
the
winds
caught
it
and
wafted
it
across
the
groves
here
i
wandered
striving
to
compose
myself
and
steady
my
nerves
for
the
coming
trial
besides
i
had
no
desire
at
present
to
betray
myself
and
to
let
my
comrades
know
the
step
i
was
contemplating
when
all
was
over
then
might
i
tell
them
my
secrets
but
until
then
i
deemed
it
best
to
keep
my
own
counsel
the
time
slipped
quickly
away
and
herio
came
to
summon
me
to
eat
already
my
companions
were
at
table
waiting
for
me
graham
wherever
on
earth
no
on
mars
do
you
hide
yourself
said
temple
as
i
entered
the
room
did
you
conceal
yourself
last
evening
we
knew
that
you
were
all
day
for
the
doctor
came
from
time
to
time
and
saw
you
as
you
slept
but
at
night
you
utterly
vanished
thought
i
told
you
explicitly
to
keep
quiet
graham
and
here
you
are
gadding
about
the
moment
you
awake
casting
all
my
cautions
to
the
winds
doctor
and
you
too
temple
as
to
where
i
spent
the
evening
i
did
so
with
volinè
at
her
invitation
and
i
assure
you
i
was
well
taken
care
of
i
do
doubt
it
what
a
lucky
fellow
you
are
and
when
is
the
fatal
day
to
be
said
temple
carelessly
and
with
a
merry
laugh
determined
to
have
his
say
for
once
in
spite
of
the
doctor
presence
yet
little
dreaming
of
the
awful
signification
his
last
words
had
for
me
real
glad
to
see
you
in
such
spirits
temple
after
all
we
have
gone
through
lately
i
answered
trying
to
turn
our
conversation
to
subjects
less
personal
and
painful
to
me
are
your
plans
for
the
future
doctor
have
you
seen
anything
more
of
the
king
graham
said
the
doctor
evidently
as
pleased
as
myself
to
see
the
conversation
taking
a
more
practical
turn
for
an
argument
of
any
feminine
subject
was
his
one
abomination
temple
and
i
had
a
long
consultation
with
the
king
yesterday
and
we
are
about
to
hold
a
grand
scientific
congress
here
in
edos
to
which
all
the
leading
philosophers
are
to
be
invited
and
then
we
are
going
to
discuss
i
do
know
how
many
important
subjects
the
king
is
quite
enthusiastic
especially
on
one
great
project
we
are
contemplating
namely
the
establishment
of
regular
communication
between
earth
and
here
i
have
also
a
bit
of
news
for
you
i
heard
yesterday
from
our
old
friend
kios
that
that
rascal
that
villain
perodii
had
destroyed
the
poor
wrecked
her
completely
you
do
mean
that
i
do
and
if
i
were
a
younger
man
i
would
thrash
him
soundly
for
his
mischief
doctor
i
answered
is
having
his
day
but
retribution
may
be
coming
swiftly
come
but
too
late
for
me
the
king
has
banished
him
from
here
worse
fate
than
that
awaits
him
or
i
am
no
prophet
i
added
in
a
tone
of
hatred
your
plans
doctor
are
going
to
make
exhaustive
collections
of
the
fauna
and
the
flora
of
this
planet
temple
is
going
to
investigate
its
commercial
resources
visiting
all
the
great
centres
of
industry
acquiring
information
useful
to
the
manufacturers
of
earth
and
at
the
same
time
imparting
whatever
knowledge
he
may
possess
that
is
likely
to
be
welcome
here
you
graham
might
do
worse
than
go
with
temple
an
engineer
would
be
a
useful
companion
ah
graham
we
have
years
of
work
before
us
years
here
in
my
glory
of
triumph
i
positively
pity
the
poor
scientists
of
earth
turning
over
and
over
their
few
theories
and
specimens
each
with
little
better
to
do
than
to
spend
his
life
and
efforts
in
seeking
to
overturn
the
views
of
his
contemporaries
on
this
question
and
on
that
it
is
almost
an
event
nowadays
in
the
scientific
world
at
home
for
any
real
good
new
species
to
be
discovered
and
yet
here
a
world
an
entire
world
crammed
full
of
new
and
curious
forms
lies
before
me
see
the
doctor
has
not
been
idle
said
temple
he
has
not
i
answered
all
you
tell
me
interests
me
exceedingly
at
any
other
time
i
should
have
felt
enchanted
whilst
listening
to
dear
old
doctor
hermann
plans
and
projects
but
this
morning
i
heard
all
that
was
said
like
one
in
a
dream
i
was
heartily
glad
when
the
doctor
took
temple
off
to
hear
of
a
wonderful
account
of
some
monster
insect
whose
habitat
was
in
a
valley
near
edos
suppose
you
are
engaged
for
the
day
graham
said
temple
slily
as
the
two
walked
away
am
going
to
write
up
some
of
my
notes
and
may
then
join
you
i
answered
evasively
already
it
wanted
but
an
hour
to
the
time
i
had
promised
volinè
to
meet
her
so
long
had
we
lingered
at
table
with
ever
increasing
excitement
with
nerves
becoming
strung
unto
their
tightest
tension
i
passed
that
hour
away
and
then
betook
myself
to
the
arbour
where
volinè
was
to
join
me
there
to
my
great
astonishment
i
found
one
of
her
maids
irolne
sister
of
cyni
awaiting
my
coming
with
a
message
from
her
mistress
saying
that
i
was
to
go
with
this
maiden
who
would
conduct
me
to
a
distant
part
of
the
palace
grounds
where
volinè
already
waited
along
secluded
paths
and
twice
for
some
considerable
way
underground
through
wild
and
wondrous
grottoes
we
went
until
at
last
we
came
unto
steps
which
seemed
to
lead
into
a
large
and
lofty
building
entirely
underground
at
the
bottom
of
this
stairway
stood
volinè
with
cyni
we
were
in
a
round
chamber
from
which
radiated
in
all
directions
large
pipes
or
tunnels
similar
to
the
one
through
which
we
were
brought
by
perodii
captives
to
edos
in
the
centre
was
a
car
by
the
side
of
which
stood
two
marshals
in
royal
uniform
smiling
sweetly
to
me
volinè
stepped
forward
and
said
to
these
attendants
would
visit
echri
temple
on
the
hill
verosi
place
us
thither
with
speed
and
beckoning
to
me
she
entered
the
car
and
i
followed
her
and
sat
down
by
her
side
then
the
car
was
turned
round
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
circle
and
began
to
move
forward
into
one
of
the
pipes
and
in
an
instant
we
were
gliding
onwards
with
speed
my
arm
stole
round
volinè
waist
as
we
travelled
on
and
kissing
her
i
said
see
dear
one
i
am
still
as
anxious
to
go
through
this
ordeal
of
fire
as
i
was
when
i
left
you
last
night
knew
thou
wouldst
not
fail
dear
harry
but
already
my
heart
falters
within
me
even
now
there
is
time
for
thee
to
repent
thy
words
lose
you
never
darling
i
see
happiness
before
me
happiness
with
you
and
though
the
path
that
leads
thereto
is
rough
and
terrible
the
reward
will
all
the
sweeter
be
we
had
no
time
for
much
further
converse
as
in
a
few
minutes
of
time
we
slowed
and
at
last
came
to
a
stop
in
another
building
similar
in
all
respects
to
the
one
we
had
left
instantly
four
venerable
priests
approached
and
with
some
invocation
which
i
did
not
understand
assisted
us
to
alight
and
in
a
tone
of
great
respect
asked
us
to
follow
them
we
walked
up
a
sloping
path
in
silence
and
then
found
ourselves
in
a
beautiful
grove
of
trees
from
which
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
towered
the
three
mighty
domes
of
burnished
metal
we
had
seen
from
the
air
when
approaching
edos
in
the
escorted
by
our
priestly
guides
we
wended
our
way
between
the
trees
until
we
reached
the
lofty
arched
entrance
to
the
temple
passing
under
this
we
came
into
a
kind
of
courtyard
after
crossing
which
we
went
through
another
and
a
smaller
way
and
here
holy
echri
stood
waiting
to
receive
us
he
was
dressed
much
more
imposingly
in
a
crimson
robe
with
a
long
rod
of
what
looked
like
fine
gold
in
his
left
hand
and
a
scroll
of
parchments
bound
and
suspended
by
a
chain
of
the
same
metal
in
his
right
to
our
holy
house
o
daughter
of
the
king
and
man
of
ramos
welcome
to
the
temple
of
god
thy
faith
is
strong
within
thee
my
son
have
no
fear
and
follow
me
without
dismay
for
heaven
shall
lend
thee
strength
equal
to
thy
weakness
then
turning
round
he
led
the
way
into
a
gorgeous
sanctuary
under
one
of
the
smaller
domes
to
say
that
i
was
astonished
at
the
magnificence
around
me
conveys
but
a
faint
idea
of
my
actual
feelings
it
was
a
temple
of
gems
and
costly
fabrics
enough
to
excite
the
envy
of
a
solomon
and
fill
his
soul
with
despair
there
were
altars
and
curious
structures
whose
uses
were
unknown
to
me
wrought
in
solid
gold
and
garnished
with
jewels
there
were
rows
and
rows
of
venerable
priests
ranged
in
close
array
round
each
altar
some
bearing
pots
of
incense
slung
by
chains
of
gold
others
with
rods
of
gold
others
yet
again
with
curious
lamps
that
burnt
so
brilliantly
that
the
eye
could
not
look
upon
them
without
becoming
almost
blind
to
all
other
objects
then
there
was
a
sumptuous
throne
encircled
round
about
with
a
low
of
gold
and
behind
that
a
lofty
gallery
also
filled
with
priests
as
we
entered
a
chant
was
sung
to
strains
of
music
where
and
how
played
i
know
not
which
vibrated
through
our
very
souls
in
its
harmonious
beauty
coming
to
a
pause
before
the
echri
bade
volinè
and
myself
stand
there
together
and
then
escorted
by
two
aged
priests
he
went
and
sat
him
down
thereon
then
the
music
and
the
singing
ceased
and
a
great
silence
fell
upon
the
assembled
throng
all
eyes
being
fixed
upon
the
throne
and
we
who
stood
before
it
volinè
clung
to
me
and
i
could
feel
that
ever
and
anon
she
trembled
violently
all
were
apparently
waiting
now
for
echri
to
act
soon
he
did
so
by
addressing
me
of
ramos
the
hour
hath
now
arrived
when
if
thy
faith
or
thy
courage
hath
not
failed
thee
thou
mayest
by
the
ordinance
of
eternal
fire
obtain
a
greater
span
of
years
for
thy
decaying
body
if
thou
hast
the
nerve
within
thee
to
let
this
living
fire
embrace
thee
then
shalt
thou
become
possessed
of
that
for
which
thy
heart
hath
craved
then
addressing
volinè
he
continued
hast
thou
volinè
daughter
of
gathma
mighty
king
sought
and
got
thy
royal
father
free
consent
to
take
this
man
of
ramos
for
thy
husband
if
so
be
thou
hast
speak
truth
most
holy
echri
the
king
hath
said
that
this
shall
be
and
i
assure
thee
this
man
of
ramos
standing
by
my
side
goes
through
thy
sacred
ceremony
with
the
king
full
knowledge
and
approval
unto
that
end
volinè
answered
in
a
voice
choked
with
the
emotion
that
was
fast
overcoming
her
now
let
us
therefore
enter
upon
our
solemn
duty
and
as
he
finished
speaking
the
multitude
of
priests
formed
themselves
into
procession
the
swung
their
cups
to
and
fro
the
hoisted
their
lights
on
high
and
the
singers
in
the
gallery
commenced
their
solemn
anthems
when
they
had
finished
singing
the
grand
procession
began
its
imposing
movement
to
the
distant
strains
of
some
of
great
power
and
loud
tone
on
which
twelve
priestly
artistes
played
with
marvellous
precision
a
march
of
beauty
though
sad
and
tenderly
plaintive
in
its
cadence
at
the
end
of
this
long
company
of
marching
priests
came
volinè
echri
and
myself
and
so
we
wended
our
way
around
the
spacious
hall
and
under
an
archway
into
a
larger
building
which
was
beneath
the
mightiest
of
the
three
brazen
domes
this
larger
temple
was
fitted
up
even
more
gorgeously
than
the
one
we
had
left
and
right
in
the
centre
thereof
was
a
high
altar
at
the
front
of
which
flowed
a
constant
stream
of
molten
fire
smokeless
and
silent
yet
so
brilliant
that
it
lighted
up
the
vast
dome
into
its
uttermost
recesses
with
a
noonday
brightness
the
heat
as
we
passed
within
fifty
paces
of
this
wondrous
was
great
and
beads
of
perspiration
formed
themselves
on
my
face
but
these
were
more
the
result
of
the
great
and
awful
excitement
that
filled
my
brain
than
the
glow
of
heat
that
radiated
from
this
living
furnace
as
we
passed
echri
said
my
son
fire
that
hath
never
ceased
to
burn
since
gathma
sprang
from
chaos
it
is
the
primordial
force
that
hath
sustained
and
nourished
life
from
the
beginning
of
all
things
yea
the
blood
that
courses
through
the
veins
and
arteries
of
worlds
it
floweth
here
by
a
dark
and
rocky
way
beneath
the
ground
from
the
mountain
of
fire
ye
perhaps
have
noted
some
distance
from
edos
i
nodded
for
i
was
absolutely
too
to
speak
and
the
old
priest
continued
thee
well
its
living
brilliant
beauty
for
it
is
the
enemy
thou
hast
to
conquer
or
rather
the
friend
that
will
help
thee
to
thy
heart
desire
i
shuddered
as
i
listened
to
his
awful
words
yet
somehow
i
felt
no
fear
no
regret
no
dread
only
an
overwhelming
sense
of
reverence
and
wonder
then
taking
volinè
and
myself
by
the
hand
he
walked
between
us
and
led
us
to
the
foot
of
another
throne
and
walking
up
the
seven
steps
of
solid
gold
sat
him
down
thereon
the
procession
of
priests
continued
walking
on
with
slow
and
stately
step
keeping
time
to
the
music
that
had
now
become
louder
more
triumphant
in
its
melody
until
to
the
closing
bars
of
this
wondrous
solo
they
ranged
themselves
in
one
wide
circle
round
the
throne
on
which
echri
sat
and
the
high
altar
before
which
flowed
the
stream
of
fire
amidst
silence
four
priests
advanced
two
carrying
chains
of
gold
and
two
with
some
kind
of
vestments
and
these
they
placed
on
a
low
table
near
and
then
stood
behind
us
still
and
silent
as
the
rest
volinè
clasped
my
hand
in
terror
but
she
seemed
too
frightened
to
speak
and
tears
were
coursing
down
her
white
lovely
face
son
our
holy
priests
shall
pray
that
god
mayest
give
thee
strength
unto
the
measure
of
thy
woe
meantime
these
men
will
take
thee
and
prepare
thee
for
thy
fiery
trial
as
soon
as
these
words
were
finished
the
four
priests
stepped
forward
and
bade
me
follow
them
they
took
me
across
the
wide
floor
of
the
temple
into
a
smaller
chamber
and
there
i
was
divested
of
my
garments
and
draped
in
a
priestly
robe
then
the
chains
were
fastened
around
my
wrists
and
i
was
given
a
draught
of
some
sweet
and
volatile
liquid
from
a
goblet
of
crystal
before
being
conducted
back
to
throne
volinè
was
sobbing
loudly
but
i
felt
brave
endowed
with
a
strength
and
stood
calmly
waiting
for
the
end
to
come
thou
still
desire
to
proceed
through
this
ordeal
man
of
ramos
said
echri
in
a
solemn
tone
thou
still
the
inclination
to
wed
this
gracious
lady
the
daughter
of
our
king
by
such
means
as
have
already
been
explained
to
thee
am
ready
i
answered
in
a
firm
unfaltering
voice
with
my
arms
extended
towards
him
draped
in
their
manacles
of
gold
us
in
your
fire
o
holy
priest
weld
our
souls
together
upon
the
of
your
strange
mysterious
faith
make
our
two
loving
hearts
but
one
i
am
ready
to
brave
your
fiery
ordeal
pass
through
the
glowing
furnace
of
your
wondrous
creed
to
reach
my
wedded
bliss
here
volinè
by
a
great
effort
composed
herself
to
speak
and
turning
round
she
looked
at
me
in
a
tender
supplicating
way
saying
harry
harry
my
love
for
thee
is
strong
yet
my
poor
heart
falters
before
echri
sacred
furnace
alas
alas
my
courage
fails
me
my
dear
one
my
brave
one
i
am
not
worthy
of
such
love
as
thine
leave
me
return
unto
thine
own
people
spare
thyself
this
agony
of
fire
return
i
bid
thee
and
be
safe
volinè
speak
not
so
for
your
words
wound
me
worse
than
that
fire
i
now
yearn
to
pass
through
to
reach
the
full
measure
of
my
joy
courage
darling
courage
as
beseems
a
daughter
of
your
noble
peerless
race
i
wait
but
echri
word
to
enter
yon
shrine
of
fire
he
will
unite
our
hearts
together
for
all
things
to
him
seem
possible
i
answered
bowing
reverently
before
the
throne
on
which
echri
sat
unmoved
at
volinè
sorrow
solemn
and
still
as
though
carved
in
marble
patiently
waiting
to
complete
what
i
deemed
the
spiritual
portion
of
our
strange
betrothal
holy
echri
this
thing
must
not
be
his
pain
is
my
pain
and
if
he
will
not
spare
himself
then
must
thou
spare
him
volinè
said
in
a
voice
piteous
to
hear
and
her
words
went
each
like
a
dagger
into
my
heart
turning
to
me
she
continued
thou
shalt
not
go
yea
i
will
even
wed
thee
as
thou
art
come
back
to
me
for
my
heart
is
breaking
come
back
to
me
come
back
and
comfort
my
dreadful
sorrow
oh
why
did
i
tell
thee
of
this
terrible
thing
oh
why
did
i
tempt
thee
why
oh
why
did
i
counsel
thee
to
this
why
send
thee
to
such
a
doom
of
agony
for
me
thee
whom
i
love
better
than
my
own
life
but
even
as
volinè
spoke
i
was
led
away
by
the
attendant
priests
feeling
powerless
to
help
the
woman
i
loved
and
growing
more
determined
to
consummate
the
dread
doom
before
me
they
led
me
unto
the
fiery
stream
and
there
as
echri
rose
and
raised
his
voice
in
some
unknown
tongue
the
floor
gave
way
beneath
me
and
i
sank
in
an
oblique
direction
into
a
small
pit
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
under
or
in
the
very
course
of
the
fiery
stream
then
all
became
dark
and
i
could
hear
as
afar
off
the
singing
of
the
priests
their
music
and
the
piteous
appeals
of
she
whom
i
loved
shortly
the
agony
of
my
awful
situation
entered
into
my
soul
yet
all
was
hopeless
now
hopeless
a
living
death
by
fire
approached
me
i
tried
to
cry
out
but
my
voice
was
dumb
the
one
word
i
could
say
became
but
a
hideous
rattle
in
my
burning
throat
and
as
my
eyes
strove
in
vain
to
penetrate
the
ghastly
gloom
of
this
dread
chamber
the
blackness
around
me
seemed
to
fall
away
and
a
volume
of
fire
approached
scorched
and
burnt
by
the
sudden
heat
all
the
agony
of
death
entered
into
my
soul
in
that
one
awful
moment
of
time
my
brain
seemed
to
burst
asunder
with
pain
and
all
became
an
instant
blank
how
long
this
lasted
i
know
not
but
in
what
seemed
to
me
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
i
awoke
and
found
myself
in
the
same
small
chamber
where
the
priests
had
robed
and
chained
me
echri
stood
near
and
the
same
priests
were
arranging
my
old
garments
ready
for
use
the
melted
gold
of
my
manacles
still
hung
in
guttered
streams
from
my
wrists
my
robe
was
burned
to
tinder
yet
otherwise
not
one
trace
of
fire
marked
my
body
and
even
the
downy
hair
upon
my
arms
was
soft
and
unsinged
the
sacred
ring
upon
my
finger
had
also
passed
through
the
fire
unscathed
at
all
this
i
marvelled
greatly
and
pondered
in
amazement
i
felt
myself
and
yet
i
knew
instinctively
i
was
not
what
had
actually
befallen
me
i
had
not
a
single
remembrance
all
was
blotted
out
by
that
stream
of
raging
fire
how
this
wonderful
transformation
had
been
accomplished
i
never
learned
it
was
the
secret
of
echri
and
his
son
thou
hast
acted
as
only
a
brave
man
couldst
begarb
thyself
and
hasten
to
the
comfort
of
her
whom
thou
lovest
she
needs
thy
care
i
walked
by
echri
side
back
into
the
temple
and
as
i
entered
a
song
of
my
triumph
over
death
was
raised
in
my
honour
and
strains
of
sweet
music
rolled
through
the
mighty
dome
like
a
paean
of
praise
i
ran
forward
in
my
joy
and
volinè
sobbing
and
weeping
bitterly
fell
senseless
into
my
arms
doth
not
kill
my
son
let
her
tears
flow
freely
for
they
will
bear
away
her
sorrow
and
her
faintness
is
but
caused
by
her
pleasure
at
seeing
thee
slowly
we
brought
my
poor
darling
back
to
life
and
then
she
and
i
wended
our
way
from
this
tabernacle
of
fiery
mystery
into
the
place
where
we
might
start
back
to
edos
again
in
my
great
concern
for
volinè
i
forgot
even
to
thank
echri
or
to
speak
to
any
living
soul
but
her
all
my
thoughts
were
centered
in
volinè
and
the
moment
that
we
were
at
last
alone
in
the
carriage
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
we
rained
passionate
kisses
upon
each
other
lips
harry
how
i
love
thee
verily
hast
thou
won
me
at
the
shrine
of
death
joy
that
fills
these
fleeting
moments
is
a
full
recompense
for
aught
that
i
have
suffered
darling
and
now
you
must
try
and
be
your
own
dear
self
i
want
to
see
the
roses
in
your
cheeks
again
and
the
happy
careless
smile
upon
your
lips
once
more
come
darling
cheer
up
now
all
is
over
and
we
have
the
long
and
radiant
future
before
us
thou
always
be
so
good
and
kind
and
loving
as
thou
art
just
now
oh
harry
i
shall
worship
thee
if
thou
art
ever
so
ever
my
dear
one
for
i
love
you
love
you
better
now
volinè
than
i
ever
have
before
and
darling
i
have
now
a
request
to
ask
that
i
can
grant
thee
thou
canst
have
for
asking
do
with
me
as
thou
wilt
dear
one
when
may
i
look
for
the
consummation
of
my
happiness
when
shall
our
nuptials
be
when
will
you
name
your
bridal
day
so
that
i
may
make
you
my
own
for
evermore
harry
thy
words
almost
frighten
me
how
impatient
thou
hast
become
in
how
many
months
must
i
say
many
months
i
repeated
in
despair
surely
you
will
not
be
so
cruel
promise
me
in
one
month
even
in
less
my
father
so
wishes
then
will
i
favour
thee
she
answered
hiding
her
blushing
cheeks
upon
my
breast
wilt
that
content
thee
by
this
time
we
had
reached
the
palace
grounds
in
edos
again
and
upon
leaving
the
car
we
found
volinè
two
handmaidens
waiting
for
their
mistress
there
i
left
her
in
their
charge
and
sought
the
palace
by
another
way
alone
chapter
xviii
the
fight
for
volinè
the
shades
of
night
were
beginning
to
fall
as
i
crossed
the
garden
of
which
was
a
fortunate
circumstance
for
me
as
i
desired
to
see
no
one
least
of
all
any
of
my
companions
until
my
nerves
felt
steadier
for
now
they
seemed
shattered
by
the
trying
terrible
strain
which
they
had
undergone
within
the
past
few
hours
by
still
further
good
fortune
i
gained
the
palace
unobserved
except
by
the
guard
at
the
gates
and
a
solitary
martial
whom
i
met
in
one
of
the
corridors
near
my
own
room
i
flung
myself
upon
my
couch
and
tried
to
think
but
my
thoughts
were
broken
and
confused
all
that
had
taken
place
seemed
as
a
dream
first
one
incident
and
then
another
of
the
weird
ceremony
flashed
through
my
brain
and
vanished
and
then
all
returned
together
as
swiftly
yet
in
disordered
sequence
until
i
dropped
into
a
troubled
sleep
for
twelve
hours
i
lay
thus
only
awaking
in
the
morning
to
find
my
servant
herio
bending
over
me
saying
in
a
voice
which
sounded
as
though
it
were
miles
away
rouse
thee
for
the
king
would
see
thee
even
now
he
awaiteth
thy
coming
herio
what
is
the
hour
how
long
have
i
slept
has
anyone
been
here
the
doctor
mr
temple
tenth
hour
of
the
new
day
soundeth
sire
but
one
soul
hath
entered
thy
chamber
and
he
whom
thou
callest
doctor
he
watched
by
thee
as
thou
slept
until
midnight
and
glanced
at
thee
again
at
sunrise
for
a
moment
quickly
eating
a
light
breakfast
and
feeling
more
refreshed
and
stronger
than
i
had
done
for
many
days
i
followed
herio
to
the
apartment
in
which
the
king
was
awaiting
me
volinè
looking
pale
and
wan
was
seated
on
the
dais
on
her
father
right
hand
whilst
below
him
much
to
my
surprise
and
embarrassment
were
temple
and
the
doctor
behind
them
a
hundred
or
more
of
the
highest
ministers
of
state
sat
in
silence
blushes
stole
over
volinè
lovely
face
as
she
smiled
on
me
in
welcome
temple
and
the
doctor
gazing
all
the
time
in
rapt
astonishment
bade
me
a
hearty
and
the
king
in
his
kindliest
manner
told
me
to
come
and
seat
myself
at
his
left
hand
man
of
ramos
have
i
heard
the
full
story
of
thy
dauntless
courage
yesterday
on
the
hill
verosi
our
beloved
daughter
volinè
tells
me
of
thy
fortitude
in
meeting
wrestling
with
and
overcoming
death
by
fire
right
nobly
hath
thou
done
all
that
was
required
of
thee
and
thy
reward
shalt
be
that
for
which
thy
heart
hath
long
desired
for
now
do
i
give
thee
my
daughter
to
wife
here
the
old
king
stood
up
and
taking
volinè
hand
and
mine
placed
them
in
each
other
saying
doing
this
thing
i
feel
that
the
hand
of
wisdom
hath
guided
me
to
a
just
atonement
and
a
wise
repentance
of
my
sin
in
seeking
thy
life
and
thy
companions
lives
without
full
cause
already
hath
echri
told
me
my
folly
and
of
his
wondrous
vision
in
which
was
declared
to
him
that
with
thy
advent
in
gathma
god
promise
to
unite
his
scattered
universe
was
being
fulfilled
thou
art
no
more
man
of
ramos
only
man
of
gathma
too
hath
thou
become
and
may
thy
lengthened
span
of
life
be
used
in
binding
these
two
in
yet
closer
unity
i
have
but
few
more
words
to
say
thou
hast
an
enemy
in
edos
by
name
perodii
long
hath
he
sought
thy
ruin
by
divers
means
yea
even
at
the
cost
of
volinè
honour
that
the
lies
he
spoke
concerning
her
were
bred
of
jealousy
of
thee
i
now
know
and
his
banishment
from
our
royal
presence
is
but
a
just
punishment
for
his
sin
but
perodii
is
of
a
noble
race
which
hath
many
privileges
i
may
not
take
away
one
of
these
is
that
being
thy
rival
to
the
hand
of
my
daughter
he
hath
the
right
to
meet
thee
in
single
combat
to
decide
the
issue
between
ye
he
hath
claimed
that
right
and
moreover
he
hath
proclaimed
throughout
edos
that
thou
shalt
do
him
battle
or
be
slain
by
him
as
a
coward
i
ask
thy
answer
to
this
challenge
i
will
meet
him
whenever
he
may
choose
for
few
things
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
o
king
of
gathma
than
to
satisfy
the
hatred
that
long
has
lain
between
us
i
answered
still
holding
volinè
hand
in
mine
shall
be
as
thou
sayest
said
the
king
who
turning
to
his
ministers
continued
perodii
hear
these
things
at
once
and
let
all
be
set
in
readiness
for
the
morrow
and
then
the
old
king
turned
to
leave
the
chamber
which
was
a
signal
for
the
assembled
ministers
to
disperse
unto
their
duties
bidding
the
doctor
accompany
him
to
discuss
still
further
the
projects
which
they
had
in
view
i
led
volinè
away
towards
her
own
apartments
and
as
we
walked
along
she
said
thou
hast
grieved
me
sorely
in
respect
to
this
meeting
with
perodii
have
i
not
already
counselled
thee
to
leave
him
alone
be
branded
as
a
coward
darling
would
you
care
to
hear
your
lover
name
bandied
about
edos
as
another
name
for
cowardice
volinè
have
no
fears
for
me
as
i
have
none
for
myself
perodii
is
cunning
in
the
use
of
arms
not
yourself
darling
for
with
you
as
the
issue
between
us
there
lives
no
man
in
all
wide
gathma
that
should
overcome
me
besides
perodii
insults
on
you
can
only
be
answered
for
in
this
manner
before
edos
he
once
has
lied
before
edos
shall
he
declare
himself
a
speaker
of
lies
thou
wilt
harry
but
my
heart
will
be
heavy
and
comfortless
until
this
fray
is
over
now
my
darling
have
you
spoken
to
your
father
about
our
have
and
he
sayeth
that
it
may
be
chosen
by
myself
if
i
overcome
perodii
in
fair
and
open
combat
on
the
morrow
will
you
come
unto
me
volinè
let
the
morrow
be
our
bridal
day
nay
urge
no
obstacles
my
dear
one
say
yes
and
give
me
new
strength
for
the
fray
will
tell
thee
when
thou
meetest
me
in
the
arbour
of
siccoth
now
hurry
thee
away
for
there
is
much
that
i
would
do
before
the
sun
hath
risen
on
the
morrow
on
my
way
back
i
met
temple
and
he
was
profuse
in
his
congratulations
on
my
happiness
graham
the
events
of
the
past
four
and
twenty
hours
seem
like
a
dream
even
in
this
strange
city
of
enchantment
and
wondrous
surprises
now
come
along
and
have
a
chat
surely
the
beautiful
volinè
can
spare
you
for
one
hour
in
which
you
may
talk
with
your
friends
to
tell
the
truth
i
feel
almost
afraid
of
you
now
if
all
that
i
have
heard
is
true
temple
and
what
may
you
have
heard
i
asked
as
we
strolled
out
of
the
palace
together
and
sat
ourselves
down
under
the
cool
shade
of
a
shrub
have
heard
so
much
that
really
i
scarcely
know
where
to
begin
in
describing
it
briefly
it
is
this
that
yesterday
afternoon
volinè
and
yourself
went
into
that
temple
on
the
hill
we
saw
from
the
and
that
there
you
went
through
some
fiendish
art
of
sorcery
which
has
professed
to
endow
you
with
a
longer
span
of
life
after
what
happened
at
remagaloth
i
must
confess
i
felt
a
certain
amount
of
faith
in
this
priest
echri
power
but
that
he
can
prolong
your
days
even
to
the
extent
of
one
i
do
not
believe
think
you
would
temple
had
you
seen
and
experienced
as
much
as
i
have
religious
ordinances
in
this
world
are
as
one
might
expect
them
to
be
vastly
different
from
any
now
on
earth
here
in
gathma
there
are
holy
men
who
appear
to
be
direct
agents
of
a
supreme
being
and
through
them
almighty
will
is
manifest
after
all
there
is
nothing
so
very
remarkable
about
this
for
even
in
our
world
during
the
days
of
the
patriarchs
very
similar
conditions
prevailed
it
must
be
more
than
human
sorcery
or
trickery
that
can
send
a
man
through
a
stream
of
molten
fire
unscathed
unsinged
as
i
went
yesterday
although
i
suffered
in
one
brief
awful
moment
all
the
pain
of
death
in
that
dread
majestic
element
whether
i
live
to
be
seventy
or
ten
times
seventy
time
alone
can
prove
but
i
have
every
faith
in
echri
power
i
can
understand
your
scepticism
but
let
the
solemn
assurances
of
one
who
has
seen
his
potency
and
felt
his
power
change
your
opinion
how
this
wonder
was
worked
how
my
body
escaped
annihilation
or
if
destroyed
how
another
so
similar
in
all
respects
that
i
can
not
find
one
tittle
of
difference
myself
was
created
is
as
much
a
mystery
to
me
as
to
you
as
that
fair
temple
yonder
guards
its
secrets
well
what
good
have
you
really
done
yourself
graham
in
this
thing
provided
all
be
true
my
span
of
life
at
least
tenfold
and
won
the
hand
of
as
fair
a
woman
as
was
ever
conceived
sold
your
soul
to
evil
i
fear
i
am
content
to
abide
by
my
bargain
although
no
thought
of
such
a
compact
has
ever
suggested
itself
to
me
but
what
is
the
opinion
you
must
be
mad
mad
and
blind
with
love
and
that
he
has
never
seen
such
a
rapid
change
in
a
man
as
has
taken
place
in
you
since
you
met
volinè
all
interest
in
your
old
pursuits
seems
gone
all
feelings
of
companionship
for
us
are
slipping
away
i
suppose
it
is
ever
so
i
was
the
same
myself
in
the
long
ago
when
a
mistress
comes
to
reign
in
our
heart
verily
in
the
early
days
of
her
power
she
rules
supreme
i
do
think
the
dear
old
boy
will
ever
quite
forgive
you
he
has
curious
ideas
on
women
besides
he
always
insists
that
all
the
evil
that
has
befallen
us
in
edos
was
caused
by
her
am
afraid
were
useless
to
deny
the
soft
impeachment
temple
but
after
all
volinè
who
you
yourself
must
own
is
peerless
amongst
her
sex
and
i
have
had
little
time
together
and
more
than
our
share
of
trials
and
troubles
during
our
courtship
wait
until
i
enter
the
noble
army
of
benedicts
all
being
well
i
expect
my
commission
therein
and
then
you
will
again
find
me
heart
and
soul
with
you
in
all
your
plans
for
if
i
overcome
this
scamp
perodii
and
a
greater
scoundrel
never
drew
air
i
hope
to
wed
volinè
before
the
day
has
passed
fancy
perodii
challenging
me
it
is
the
last
in
the
trick
of
his
revenge
and
hatred
but
i
think
i
hold
the
ace
of
his
suit
you
really
mean
to
fight
should
rather
think
i
do
i
am
not
quite
a
fool
with
the
cutlass
or
with
the
pistol
either
and
i
picked
up
a
few
wrinkles
in
the
use
of
the
dagger
when
i
was
engineering
some
waterworks
in
spain
which
may
now
be
of
service
to
me
and
if
personal
prowess
alone
is
to
decide
between
us
well
i
will
show
this
braggart
strong
as
he
is
how
a
yorkshireman
in
good
can
as
we
say
in
that
fair
county
of
broad
acres
and
honest
hospitality
i
wish
you
every
success
graham
my
boy
every
success
and
every
happiness
and
no
one
in
all
edos
will
see
you
lead
volinè
to
the
altar
that
is
if
an
altar
forms
a
necessary
article
of
the
marriage
ceremony
in
this
strange
world
with
more
genuine
pleasure
than
i
shall
i
feel
that
indirectly
and
through
you
i
owe
my
life
to
this
girl
in
spite
of
all
that
the
doctor
may
say
to
the
contrary
and
that
being
so
i
wish
her
every
happiness
too
besides
this
match
appears
to
find
great
favour
with
the
king
for
that
i
have
to
thank
echri
it
appears
that
he
has
had
a
vision
in
which
it
was
declared
that
the
peoples
on
the
family
of
planets
that
circle
round
the
sun
are
to
be
united
and
that
we
having
established
communication
between
earth
and
mars
are
fulfilling
this
sacred
manifestation
this
the
king
has
only
lately
learned
from
echri
and
it
has
done
more
than
anything
else
to
place
us
high
in
royal
favour
and
to
win
consent
to
my
union
with
volinè
now
about
this
fight
have
you
no
idea
of
the
weapons
conditions
of
combat
and
so
on
nor
do
i
want
any
but
if
you
should
chance
to
drop
on
sandy
campbell
tell
him
that
i
would
see
him
i
should
like
him
near
me
just
as
a
sort
of
henchman
like
understand
wo
fail
to
send
him
if
i
get
the
chance
but
the
doctor
keeps
him
more
than
busy
only
this
very
morning
he
packed
him
off
somewhere
or
other
in
search
of
some
insect
which
he
tells
me
is
curiously
allied
to
a
beetle
of
earth
poor
old
sandy
i
have
half
a
mind
to
pity
him
in
his
search
for
that
illustrious
bug
chatting
together
thus
the
morning
slipped
quickly
and
pleasantly
away
until
we
were
summoned
to
our
meal
neither
the
king
nor
volinè
was
present
and
the
doctor
as
well
was
too
absorbed
in
his
studies
to
make
his
appearance
i
spent
the
afternoon
posting
up
my
journals
from
which
this
portion
of
our
narrative
has
been
written
and
in
the
evening
i
went
unto
our
there
to
wait
my
loved
one
coming
verily
the
quiet
dreamy
beauty
of
the
night
in
this
tropic
region
of
mars
is
beyond
all
power
of
description
the
atmosphere
is
balmier
than
in
the
torrid
zone
of
earth
by
reason
of
the
greater
remoteness
of
the
sun
and
the
absence
of
all
those
that
make
life
there
unendurable
especially
during
hours
of
darkness
such
nights
inspire
love
such
an
atmosphere
makes
the
tender
sacred
passion
glow
with
an
intensity
unknown
in
higher
and
cooler
latitudes
the
air
breathes
it
the
sing
it
the
fountains
in
their
rising
and
falling
cadence
echo
it
from
grove
to
grove
the
moons
and
stars
scintillating
in
their
ether
sea
of
blue
excite
it
even
the
very
flowers
distil
it
in
their
ravishing
perfume
ah
is
a
wondrous
thing
this
universal
love
a
legacy
of
god
immutable
unchanging
through
the
unrecorded
ages
on
every
sphere
where
man
doth
dwell
best
described
as
a
passion
of
the
night
as
its
subtle
influence
is
strongest
under
a
starlit
sky
for
doth
it
not
droop
and
languish
under
the
fierce
light
and
blazing
heat
of
day
requiring
softer
illuminants
and
balmier
air
to
flourish
in
all
its
beautiful
intensity
no
other
feeling
evolved
by
the
human
mind
can
compare
in
tenderness
or
beauty
with
that
of
first
love
he
who
has
not
known
that
incomparable
knows
not
what
it
is
to
live
for
of
all
the
feelings
that
animate
the
human
breast
it
is
at
once
the
most
tender
the
most
pure
full
of
innocence
yet
heavy
with
primordial
sin
selfish
yet
generous
passionate
yet
without
lust
divine
yet
human
but
here
my
reverie
in
siccoth
arbour
was
broken
by
the
of
volinè
and
in
a
few
moments
she
was
by
my
side
harry
dear
so
thou
art
communing
with
thyself
or
maybe
with
the
stars
dost
thou
still
cherish
love
for
that
mother
earth
shining
so
witchingly
fair
above
thee
or
for
anyone
that
doth
dwell
thereon
a
woman
nay
my
darling
i
answered
drawing
her
gently
to
my
breast
and
planting
a
kiss
on
her
lips
as
i
spoke
have
no
thoughts
away
from
you
you
are
the
nucleus
of
them
all
their
one
inspiration
i
was
musing
to
myself
on
love
ah
volinè
even
on
first
love
the
tender
passion
you
and
you
alone
have
inspired
within
me
and
i
mused
on
the
exceeding
beauty
of
this
wondrous
thing
and
of
its
universality
until
your
footsteps
broke
the
thread
of
my
reverie
and
swept
away
the
one
that
tinged
my
bliss
and
transformed
it
into
perfect
joy
what
may
this
one
cloud
of
sorrow
be
be
separated
from
you
even
for
one
hour
one
moment
my
heart
is
yearning
for
the
time
when
we
may
part
no
more
when
i
may
proudly
call
you
mine
mine
for
ever
is
there
no
one
who
beckoneth
to
thee
from
that
yonder
no
memory
of
one
fairer
in
thy
sight
than
i
darling
i
sighed
i
not
told
you
that
until
i
saw
you
i
knew
not
love
and
that
the
women
of
my
native
earth
can
not
compare
with
you
in
grace
and
beauty
i
have
but
a
single
thought
for
all
those
teeming
millions
of
humanity
that
people
yon
shining
star
and
that
one
is
for
the
old
father
who
parted
from
me
with
his
blessing
when
i
left
its
surface
years
ago
i
may
never
see
him
dost
thou
know
harry
i
have
great
curiosity
to
visit
thy
native
world
all
would
seem
so
wondrous
strange
to
me
perhaps
the
day
may
yet
come
when
i
shall
take
my
darling
yonder
for
i
hear
from
my
companions
that
great
things
are
being
planned
and
that
your
royal
father
takes
a
deep
interest
in
them
but
now
tell
me
dear
one
if
i
may
take
you
to
myself
for
ever
is
the
morn
to
bring
your
bridal
day
thy
words
have
stirred
sad
thoughts
within
my
heart
thou
hast
promised
to
fight
perodii
when
the
fight
is
over
then
if
all
be
well
she
sighed
mayest
have
thy
wish
for
then
will
i
become
thy
wife
and
she
hid
her
blushing
face
and
stole
yet
closer
into
my
arms
words
dear
one
make
me
feel
happier
than
i
can
say
and
for
a
few
moments
neither
of
us
spoke
and
only
the
loud
fast
beating
of
our
own
hearts
broke
the
silence
surrounding
us
harry
i
must
leave
thee
i
would
see
my
father
before
the
evening
hath
passed
when
i
see
your
dear
face
again
i
may
leave
you
no
more
you
will
not
be
present
at
this
fray
dear
harry
i
could
not
but
i
will
pray
for
thee
and
when
all
is
over
and
thou
art
victorious
as
i
trust
thou
mayest
be
then
will
i
come
to
bring
thee
thy
reward
now
fare
thee
well
and
may
all
good
fortune
attend
thee
on
the
morrow
and
trying
bravely
to
conceal
her
agitation
and
her
tears
volinè
walked
with
me
through
the
silver
sheeny
moonlight
unto
the
palace
where
with
a
last
sweet
kiss
she
left
me
and
went
her
way
the
night
was
a
restless
sleepless
one
for
me
and
right
gladly
i
welcomed
the
first
streaks
of
what
was
to
prove
one
of
the
most
eventful
days
of
my
life
i
was
up
with
the
sun
and
the
first
person
i
saw
was
himos
and
from
him
i
learned
particulars
of
the
coming
duel
we
were
to
fight
with
a
peculiar
kind
of
short
broad
sword
in
a
large
arena
where
combats
of
this
description
were
wont
to
be
decided
the
hour
for
the
fray
was
ten
and
the
king
had
signified
his
intention
of
being
present
and
acting
as
umpire
between
us
then
came
sandy
his
face
absolutely
beaming
with
delight
at
the
prospect
of
a
little
fighting
and
with
a
due
sense
of
his
importance
on
acting
as
my
second
bonnie
prince

but
have
you
heard
anything
from
the
doctor
about
this
business
i
asked
just
out
of
curiosity
an
i
have
the
doctor
is
powerful
annoyed
and
i
heard
him
tell
temple
only
last
night
that
this
affair
bears
out
what
he
has
insisted
on
a
the
time
that
ye
are
daft
love

it

is
all

and
now
sandy
my
boy
hasten
away
and
learn
what
you
can
of
the
arrangements
made
for
the
fight
i
am
growing
impatient
to
get
it
over
one
way
or
the
other
ye
are
graham
sandy
will
do
the
best
he
can
for
ye
ha
been
a
guid
friend
to
me
and
so
saying
the
blunt
yet
honest
scot
took
himself
off
in
the
highest
spirits
rejoicing
that
for
one
day
at
least
he
would
be
free
from
the
task
of
hunting
for
the
doctor
to
engage
in
duties
more
congenial
to
his
tastes
i
studiously
avoided
contact
with
either
the
doctor
or
temple
taking
breakfast
in
my
own
room
from
which
i
did
not
stir
until
summoned
by
the
king
marshals
to
accompany
them
to
the
arena
i
felt
in
little
mood
to
talk
until
this
fight
was
over
just
before
their
arrival
i
was
agreeably
surprised
by
a
visit
from
irolne
who
brought
me
a
single
white
flower
from
her
mistress
with
the
following
message
this
for
volinè
sake
she
loves
thee
and
prays
for
him
she
loves
the
arena
was
situated
in
a
remote
part
of
the
palace
grounds
entirely
strange
to
me
we
could
have
travelled
there
by
one
of
those
wonderful
but
i
preferred
to
go
on
foot
thinking
that
the
walk
in
the
morning
air
might
do
me
good
this
duel
between
perodii
and
myself
had
made
a
great
sensation
not
only
in
edos
but
in
all
the
cities
for
many
leagues
around
and
early
as
was
the
hour
a
vast
concourse
had
assembled
all
of
noble
birth
or
high
in
station
to
witness
the
fight
this
colossal
arena
was
open
to
the
sky
although
round
the
sides
a
kind
of
awning
had
been
erected
over
the
spectators
who
must
have
numbered
quite
two
hundred
thousand
strong
in
the
centre
was
a
table
on
which
short
swords
were
placed
and
here
i
saw
sandy
carefully
examining
and
testing
the
blades
already
the
king
was
seated
and
by
his
side
were
temple
the
doctor
and
a
few
of
the
highest
ministers
i
stood
with
himos
at
the
entrance
to
the
arena
concealed
from
the
gaze
of
the
spectators
waiting
for
the
proceedings
to
begin
but
of
my
antagonist
i
had
not
yet
caught
a
glimpse
then
sandy
came
and
helped
me
to
prepare
myself
for
the
fight
this
i
did
by
taking
off
hat
coat
and
vest
and
with
rolled
up
above
my
elbows
a
scarlet
sash
bound
tightly
round
my
waist
i
soon
felt
ready
even
eager
for
the
fray
we
had
not
long
to
wait
first
came
twenty
heralds
into
the
arena
and
having
sounded
a
mighty
blast
upon
their
instruments
a
marshal
stepped
forward
and
then
a
great
silence
fell
as
he
prepared
to
speak
in
a
clear
ringing
voice
which
owing
to
some
marvellous
system
of
acoustics
must
have
been
heard
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
this
grand
enclosure
he
said
of
ramos
his
highness
prince
perodii
being
thy
rival
to
the
hand
of
our
gracious
mistress
volinè
the
king
daughter
hath
called
upon
thee
to
fight
with
him
so
that
this
issue
between
ye
may
be
fairly
tried
by
courage
strength
and
the
use
of
swords
here
followed
by
faithful
sandy
i
walked
into
the
centre
of
the
arena
bowing
to
the
king
amidst
a
loud
murmur
of
excitement
and
curiosity
from
the
surrounding
throng
then
followed
another
deafening
blast
from
the
twenty
heralds
and
once
again
the
marshal
spoke
perodii
this
man
of
ramos
thy
rival
to
the
hand
of
volinè
our
mistress
hath
answered
unto
thy
challenge
and
standeth
ready
so
that
this
issue
between
ye
may
be
fairly
tried
by
courage
strength
and
the
use
of
swords
then
once
more
amid
murmurs
of
excitement
mingled
not
a
little
with
applause
from
those
who
evidently
were
friends
of
my
rival
perodii
stripped
to
the
waist
walked
proudly
and
confidently
forward
from
another
entrance
towards
me
stopping
paces
from
where
i
stood
each
looked
fiercely
at
the
other
yet
neither
spoke
again
a
terrible
silence
fell
as
the
king
rose
up
and
said
for
my
beloved
daughter
favour
ye
have
met
to
fight
so
that
the
bitter
enmity
between
ye
may
be
closed
may
god
decide
which
is
the
better
man
by
giving
him
strength
to
overcome
the
other
let
truth
and
honour
and
courage
triumph
over
lies
and
shame
and
cowardice
take
ye
each
a
weapon
and
let
my
sitting
down
be
the
signal
for
ye
to
begin
then
we
each
stepped
forward
and
took
a
sword
beautifully
finished
weapons
about
two
feet
in
length
and
two
inches
in
breadth
dagger
pointed
and
keen
as
razors
on
their
innermost
edge
each
with
his
gleaming
naked
sword
clasped
in
his
right
hand
then
faced
the
other
and
after
a
moment
pause
perodii
spoke
at
last
the
hour
of
my
vengeance
hath
come
and
here
by
my
right
of
birth
and
station
may
i
slay
thee
and
sweep
thee
from
my
path
look
to
it
for
thy
moments
now
are
numbered
wait
for
you
perodii
and
may
heaven
defend
the
right
thy
holy
words
for
thine
own
comfort
thou
boasting
fool
but
methinks
i
will
cut
still
shorter
thy
puny
span
with
this
and
as
he
spoke
he
held
aloft
the
glittering
blade
speak
that
of
which
you
know
nothing
perodii
my
span
of
life
is
now
as
long
as
yours
for
know
you
not
that
i
have
passed
through
holy
rites
that
have
endowed
me
with
a
fuller
measure
of
years
but
we
waste
time
in
profitless
talk
come
put
up
your
sword
and
defend
yourself
i
see
echri
ring
upon
thy
finger
come
fight
fairly
take
off
that
cursed
relic
we
want
none
of
echri
magic
here
then
you
fear
its
virtues
now
well
i
have
no
wish
to
take
advantage
of
you
here
sandy
hold
this
ring
and
take
care
of
it
well
i
would
not
lose
it
for
a
world
and
so
saying
i
slipped
the
precious
talisman
from
my
finger
and
turned
to
give
it
to
sandy
that
moment
nearly
proved
fatal
to
me
for
without
warning
perodii
rushed
forward
and
made
a
terrible
thrust
at
my
unguarded
body
but
sandy
was
too
quick
for
him
and
putting
out
his
foot
he
threw
the
prince
headlong
na
perodii
none
o
that
here
ye
got
to
fight
fair
and
square
and
not
tak
a
mon
unawares
i
shouted
up
and
defend
yourself
or
my
indignation
may
prompt
me
to
slay
you
where
you
are
but
perodii
without
another
word
jumped
to
his
feet
again
and
attacked
me
with
fury
our
swords
flashed
like
silver
in
the
sunlight
as
we
parried
each
other
blows
and
thrusts
perodii
trying
his
best
to
strike
me
i
acting
on
the
defensive
having
decided
to
bide
my
time
until
the
first
frenzy
of
his
attack
was
spent
not
a
sound
was
heard
save
the
clashing
of
swords
and
our
breaths
then
perodii
in
one
of
his
mad
onslaughts
slipped
and
nearly
fell
but
recovered
himself
before
i
had
time
to
drive
in
a
blow
yet
a
thrilling
sigh
of
excitement
burst
from
the
crowd
who
thought
that
all
was
over
again
we
drew
back
panting
for
breath
and
burning
with
desire
to
slay
each
other
again
with
eyes
sparkling
in
anger
we
closed
and
once
more
the
flashing
clanging
swords
sang
the
song
of
our
hatred
perodii
was
skilled
in
the
use
of
his
weapon
and
fought
hard
but
i
think
his
courage
was
only
the
outcome
of
his
deadly
hate
which
had
worked
him
up
into
an
uncontrollable
rage
at
last
i
clumsily
gave
him
his
chance
and
was
too
late
completely
to
parry
one
of
his
fierce
strokes
his
blade
glanced
off
my
own
and
inflicted
a
deep
stinging
cut
in
my
arm
amidst
my
pain
i
heard
cries
of
concern
from
the
doctor
and
temple
as
each
jumped
to
their
feet
but
the
king
sat
calmly
looking
on
then
we
drew
back
and
stood
panting
until
sandy
had
deftly
and
quickly
bound
up
my
wound
saying
in
again
graham
he
getting
spent
besides
your
wound
will
stiffen
if
ye
do
not
keep
your
arm
at
wark
again
we
closed
and
stung
to
desperation
by
my
smarting
wound
and
thoughts
of
her
who
lonely
and
sadly
was
praying
for
me
and
whose
flower
still
clung
ragged
and
drooping
to
my
heart
i
fought
and
fought
like
one
possessed
driving
my
antagonist
back
inch
by
inch
step
by
step
and
forcing
him
to
defend
himself
rather
than
to
attack
me
at
last
my
opportunity
came
and
with
a
rapid
twisting
stroke
i
wrenched
his
blade
from
his
hand
and
sent
it
spinning
and
gleaming
into
the
air
amid
a
roar
of
excitement
from
the
onlookers
but
before
i
could
recover
myself
he
closed
with
me
and
then
began
a
wild
terrible
struggle
for
life
soon
we
rolled
to
the
ground
together
and
first
one
and
then
the
other
was
uppermost
and
had
a
transient
advantage
then
we
got
on
to
our
feet
again
struggling
one
against
the
other
swaying
now
to
this
side
now
to
that
until
i
clasped
him
round
the
waist
and
summoning
all
my
strength
for
one
mighty
effort
i
bent
him
nearly
double
as
i
would
a
reed
and
hurled
him
limp
and
helpless
over
my
head
quick
as
lightning
i
ran
and
seized
my
sword
and
before
perodii
could
recover
or
attempt
to
rise
my
foot
was
planted
on
his
breast
and
my
notched
and
gleaming
sword
held
high
over
his
throat
i
cried
given
you
into
my
power
and
now
will
i
justly
avenge
all
the
insults
you
have
heaped
on
me
and
mine
and
wipe
out
the
wrongs
you
have
done
the
woman
i
love
here
volinè
entered
and
sat
down
by
her
father
side
pale
and
trembling
and
with
tears
starting
down
her
lovely
cheeks
as
thou
hopest
for
the
same
perodii
whined
in
fear
now
thoroughly
cowed
and
all
the
fight
and
courage
knocked
out
of
him
by
that
last
terrible
fall
what
mercy
would
you
have
shown
me
were
i
in
your
place
however
if
mercy
you
really
crave
buy
your
miserable
worthless
life
by
answering
what
i
ask
of
you
i
shouted
withdrawing
my
foot
and
letting
him
rise
say
that
you
lied
when
you
conspired
against
kios
and
worked
his
disgrace
and
banishment
to
pamax
know
ye
of
kios
the
words
that
clear
his
name
or
die
i
thundered
in
this
i
admit
that
i
swore
falsely
and
conspired
to
ruin
an
innocent
man
you
know
full
well
the
rest
that
i
did
this
thing
to
save
myself
from
his
just
wrath
having
ruined
his
only
child
he
continued
amidst
a
growing
storm
of
indignation
will
we
speak
of
volinè
she
whom
you
have
so
foully
wronged
and
slandered
say
that
you
lied
in
the
hall
of
judgment
and
to
the
king
say
that
volinè
honour
is
as
untarnished
as
the
mountain
snow
he
hissed
hast
humbled
me
enough
curse
thee
am
not
here
to
parley
say
this
by
the
great
god
you
shall
say
it
on
your
bended
knees
or
my
sword
shall
sheath
itself
in
your
heart
i
shouted
waxing
wroth
as
i
thought
of
my
darling
undeserved
disgrace
from
the
mouth
of
this
scoundrel
words
were
lies
he
hissed
rather
than
spoke
as
he
sank
upon
his
knees
forced
thereto
at
the
point
of
my
naked
sword
and
a
look
of
malignant
hatred
stole
over
his
face
as
he
glared
at
me
with
his
bloodshot
glittering
eyes
in
impotent
rage
like
some
helpless
in
the
hunter
toils
take
yourself
away
and
never
again
molest
me
or
mine
or
dare
to
meddle
with
affairs
that
do
not
concern
you
i
stay
me
from
wetting
my
hands
in
blood
upon
this
my
wedding
morn
volinè
nuptial
day
shall
not
be
one
of
bloodshed
but
stainless
and
happy
as
my
bonny
bride
herself
now
get
you
gone
while
the
spirit
of
my
mercy
lingers
go
and
dare
not
to
cross
my
path
again
and
amidst
shouts
of
derision
and
anger
the
vanquished
prince
left
the
arena
and
we
saw
him
no
more
then
the
heralds
stepped
forward
again
and
blew
another
blast
and
the
marshal
commanded
silence
for
the
king
to
speak
he
rose
from
his
daughter
side
looking
supremely
pleased
and
gratified
and
said
of
ramos
thou
hast
fought
fairly
and
valiantly
and
shown
mercy
to
a
vanquished
foe
which
doth
thee
great
honour
thou
hast
answered
thy
rival
challenge
as
only
a
brave
man
couldst
and
now
most
freely
do
i
give
thee
my
daughter
to
wife
she
shall
dower
thee
ten
thousand
times
more
handsomely
than
any
woman
of
the
ramos
thou
hast
lately
left
her
husband
shall
not
be
penniless
for
i
hereby
promise
him
the
sum
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
sterling
as
soon
as
communication
is
again
established
between
gathma
and
earth
and
he
may
be
able
to
present
my
cheque
for
that
amount
said
temple
jumping
to
his
feet
in
excitement
are
riches
here
enough
for
both
but
still
i
admire
the
spirit
that
hath
prompted
thee
to
make
that
remark
the
king
answered
smiling
let
the
day
that
dawned
on
strife
and
battle
set
on
love
and
peace
for
my
daughter
tells
me
she
hath
set
the
remainder
thereof
apart
for
a
bridal
feast
then
a
great
loud
shout
went
up
from
the
assembled
throng
and
the
heralds
played
a
song
of
victory
upon
their
brazen
instruments
as
i
stood
and
ragged
from
the
fray
before
the
king
the
observed
of
every
eye
king
i
crave
one
more
act
of
royal
grace
let
worthy
kios
disgraced
and
wronged
without
cause
find
place
again
in
royal
favour
and
i
would
also
ask
that
brave
and
gallant
kaosp
a
captain
in
your
guard
be
freed
from
captivity
and
restored
to
place
both
these
men
owe
their
downfall
to
the
cunning
and
the
knavery
of
perodii
but
justice
what
thou
hast
asked
and
it
shall
be
done
then
bowing
low
to
the
king
and
volinè
i
withdrew
to
put
myself
in
better
array
temple
also
came
and
was
congratulating
me
heartily
on
my
victory
when
the
doctor
made
his
appearance
graham
he
began
holding
out
his
hand
did
my
old
heart
good
to
see
how
you
thrashed
that
villain
so
the
poor
is
avenged
for
this
public
disgrace
to
such
a
man
as
perodii
is
a
terrible
punishment
well
done
my
friend
but
let
us
see
your
injury
ah
merely
a
flesh
wound
deep
but
not
dangerous
and
will
soon
heal
doctor
i
thought
i
was
too
deep
in
your
disfavour
ever
to
win
any
expressions
of
approval
from
you
again
i
retorted
there
graham
let
all
differences
of
opinion
be
put
aside
i
am
apt
to
speak
hastily
and
old
men
with
life
behind
them
are
often
too
prone
to
judge
the
actions
of
younger
men
by
their
own
experience
i
withdraw
all
i
have
said
and
wish
yes
heartily
wish
her
and
you
every
happiness
i
have
too
lively
a
recollection
of
your
great
assistance
to
my
project
both
on
earth
and
during
our
journey
hither
to
grudge
you
the
happiness
you
have
tried
so
hard
to
win
and
on
which
it
is
evident
your
heart
is
fixed
although
my
sentiments
regarding
women
in
general
may
never
alter
i
shall
certainly
make
an
exception
in
favour
of
the
wondrous
fair
lady
who
is
so
soon
to
become
your
wife
but
mind
graham
this
is
the
only
exception
i
ever
made
during
my
life
experience
of
the
sex
that
is
as
frail
as
it
is
fair
and
rightly
spoken
doctor
broke
in
temple
of
all
others
is
a
most
opportune
one
to
express
such
opinions
as
you
say
we
owe
a
good
deal
to
graham
and
i
am
sure
we
all
wish
him
joy
and
continued
happiness
thank
you
doctor
and
you
too
temple
for
your
kindly
words
especially
for
those
that
relate
to
the
girl
i
am
about
to
now
i
am
sure
you
will
excuse
me
for
my
place
is
by
her
side
after
the
hours
of
suspense
she
has
suffered
since
she
knew
of
this
fight
with
perodii
we
shall
meet
again
i
hope
a
little
later
on
when
perhaps
i
may
have
the
happiness
of
being
supported
at
the
coming
ceremony
by
two
such
old
and
trusty
friends
you
may
answered
the
doctor
and
temple
together
as
i
hastened
to
volinè
eager
to
rejoin
my
darling
and
to
soothe
her
fears
away
chapter
xix
wedded
brave
one
my
brave
one
art
thou
hurt
were
volinè
first
words
of
greeting
as
we
met
in
her
private
room
adjoining
the
arena
where
the
king
had
sat
to
see
the
fight
and
where
i
had
been
conducted
to
her
presence
by
the
irolne
darling
is
but
a
scratch
i
answered
as
we
kissed
and
nestled
into
each
other
arms
no
cloud
may
dim
the
lustre
of
our
happiness
now
surely
bride
and
groom
had
a
future
so
bright
and
fair
as
ours
we
leave
the
long
dark
vale
of
sorrow
behind
us
and
stand
at
last
upon
the
threshold
of
our
perfect
bliss
i
can
not
tell
thee
my
happiness
made
all
the
sweeter
methinks
by
the
anguish
my
soul
hath
suffered
since
last
we
met
but
how
proud
i
am
of
thee
now
thou
hast
vanquished
perodii
and
before
all
edos
freed
my
name
from
evil
gossip
i
would
sooner
thee
have
done
this
thing
than
even
my
father
volinè
i
thought
of
you
when
the
fight
waxed
hottest
and
that
thought
gave
new
strength
to
my
arm
when
weakening
by
desperate
effort
but
all
is
over
and
all
is
well
now
dear
one
tell
me
of
when
is
our
bridal
feast
to
be
and
his
have
already
reached
the
palace
and
all
is
in
readiness
to
commence
at
setting
of
the
sun
for
that
is
the
hour
we
people
of
edos
assign
unto
this
ceremony
but
harry
what
a
strange
strange
wooing
mine
hath
been
coloured
more
with
sorrow
than
with
gladness
and
even
the
early
hours
of
my
have
not
been
free
from
strife
has
been
as
you
say
but
now
perfect
peace
shall
be
my
portion
and
i
will
devote
myself
to
smoothing
her
path
across
stormy
way
my
arms
shall
ever
be
her
refuge
in
sorrow
and
her
resting
place
in
joy
life
is
done
for
i
love
you
with
a
passion
that
death
can
only
destroy
harry
it
is
sweet
to
be
loved
like
this
do
all
the
men
of
ramos
love
like
thee
methinks
there
are
plenty
of
maidens
in
edos
who
would
choose
them
a
mate
from
thy
world
rather
than
mine
if
such
be
so
darling
that
there
is
love
on
earth
as
sweet
and
pure
and
true
as
ours
i
will
not
deny
but
there
is
love
that
turns
to
bitterness
and
hatred
there
are
men
who
betray
deceive
and
wrong
in
the
sacred
name
of
love
there
are
men
who
make
vows
of
affection
and
constancy
only
to
break
them
it
is
even
so
in
gathma
and
many
the
maid
of
edos
that
hath
rued
her
before
she
hath
well
become
a
wife
my
volinè
doubt
me
does
a
single
misgiving
haunt
her
heart
now
that
she
has
given
that
heart
to
me
one
not
one
my
faith
in
thee
is
boundless
i
have
no
thought
that
thou
not
share
now
let
us
return
already
the
assembly
hath
dispersed
and
the
day
draws
on
besides
thou
must
feel
faint
and
weary
after
thy
fight
weary
in
your
precious
company
darling
i
answered
as
we
rose
and
left
the
room
we
strolled
across
the
beautiful
grounds
together
volinè
resting
confidingly
on
my
arm
and
as
we
walked
along
our
happiness
seemed
too
great
to
be
true
for
not
a
single
care
pursued
us
us
pass
by
siccoth
arbour
yet
once
again
as
lovers
harry
the
place
where
we
parted
when
sorrow
overwhelmed
us
and
hope
lay
dead
volinè
prospects
are
brighter
now
indeed
see
the
dear
old
place
is
just
the
same
to
me
the
sweetest
spot
in
all
wide
gathma
for
here
our
vows
of
love
were
pledged
and
as
i
spoke
the
palace
bells
rang
out
a
loud
and
merry
peal
like
an
omen
of
good
fortune
to
us
thee
harry
my
bridal
bells
how
strange
that
they
should
commence
whilst
we
are
here
oh
how
their
gladsome
peals
thrill
through
and
through
my
soul
my
wedding
day
so
soon
harry
do
all
the
men
and
women
of
thy
world
marry
so
quickly
after
betrothal
as
we
all
my
darling
not
all
some
tarry
months
years
and
some
even
so
long
that
they
do
not
wed
at
all
but
if
any
man
could
love
as
i
love
or
had
such
a
beautiful
being
for
the
object
of
his
affections
the
time
would
be
no
longer
than
with
us
especially
when
fate
smiles
so
sweetly
upon
my
suit
as
now
i
answered
kissing
her
upturned
face
thou
art
a
consummate
flatterer
and
yet
doth
it
not
seem
unmaidenly
for
me
to
yield
so
quickly
and
so
readily
to
thy
words
of
love
no
dear
one
i
prize
you
all
the
more
for
not
delaying
my
happiness
besides
it
seems
years
and
years
since
we
first
met
so
much
having
happened
in
the
interval
between
then
and
now
thou
hast
made
good
use
of
thy
time
if
it
hath
been
short
she
answered
with
an
artless
bewitching
smile
volinè
what
is
it
that
has
drawn
you
to
me
surely
there
are
men
in
gathma
in
edos
more
handsome
than
i
who
would
sell
their
souls
for
your
smiles
and
favour
knowest
a
woman
little
it
is
not
a
handsome
face
altogether
that
draws
or
fascinates
her
heart
but
open
winning
ways
sympathies
and
devoted
love
love
that
her
instincts
tell
her
is
true
and
unselfish
these
be
the
things
that
gain
her
favour
she
answered
as
we
passed
on
towards
the
palace
where
we
parted
until
such
time
as
the
nuptial
ceremonies
commenced
never
before
did
time
pass
away
so
slowly
as
those
few
hours
that
intervened
between
noon
and
sunset
on
this
my
each
moment
was
flighted
with
lead
each
hour
seemed
ages
to
me
who
impatiently
waited
their
course
to
run
all
day
long
the
palace
bells
at
intervals
rang
out
glad
bridal
tidings
and
those
of
edos
echoed
back
the
stirring
music
the
city
was
the
only
daughter
of
gathma
king
was
beloved
of
the
people
and
each
man
and
woman
of
edos
dames
and
nobles
of
high
degree
strove
hard
to
make
her
bridal
day
replete
with
joy
and
happiness
the
palace
swarmed
with
guests
from
near
and
far
they
made
its
stately
halls
their
or
perfumes
and
fabrics
of
priceless
worth
tributes
of
respect
and
love
to
the
daughter
of
their
king
then
troop
after
troop
of
soldiers
entered
the
palace
gates
many
dressed
in
uniforms
and
with
accoutrements
entirely
unknown
to
me
garrisons
from
places
summoned
to
do
honour
at
the
coming
ceremony
and
feast
at
last
the
sun
proclaimed
the
advent
of
evening
from
the
cloudless
west
as
he
sank
toward
the
mountain
crests
all
interest
now
was
centred
within
the
magnificent
hall
of
ceremonies
a
vast
and
lofty
chamber
in
the
western
wing
of
the
palace
here
a
great
throng
of
guests
had
assembled
to
witness
the
brilliant
nuptials
no
word
of
ours
can
hope
to
describe
the
overwhelming
splendours
of
that
wondrous
hall
as
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
streamed
through
the
windows
upon
what
was
literally
one
blaze
of
sparkling
jewels
not
a
guest
was
there
who
did
not
scintillate
with
precious
stones
cunningly
arranged
to
harmonise
with
their
rich
and
raiment
then
the
delicate
draperies
that
hung
in
graceful
folds
round
the
entrances
contrasted
well
with
the
slender
pillars
of
gold
that
shot
upwards
fashioned
like
to
support
the
roof
in
niches
round
the
walls
were
arranged
groups
of
statuary
all
carved
in
the
famous
marble
and
on
the
walls
themselves
were
paintings
of
fair
women
and
handsome
men
of
strange
landscapes
of
fruits
and
flowers
of
beasts
and
winged
creatures
all
drawn
with
marvellous
skill
and
exceeding
beauty
nearly
one
quarter
of
this
mighty
hall
was
still
empty
of
people
the
guests
who
must
have
numbered
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
were
all
seated
the
reserved
space
at
the
end
of
the
hall
was
for
those
engaged
in
the
nuptial
ceremony
as
the
sun
finally
sank
behind
the
mountains
casting
the
draperies
of
night
edos
the
great
hall
suddenly
became
illumined
with
brilliant
light
and
almost
simultaneously
a
score
of
heralds
marched
in
and
blew
a
lusty
blast
upon
their
trumpets
of
gold
at
once
a
great
silence
of
expectation
seized
the
gay
and
laughing
guests
and
amidst
hushed
excitement
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
grand
entrance
at
the
end
of
the
hall
shortly
the
enormous
curtains
were
drawn
aside
and
we
could
see
the
wide
corridor
behind
them
lined
on
either
side
with
royal
troops
then
regiment
after
regiment
of
soldiers
came
along
with
colours
flying
and
bands
playing
triumphant
music
each
man
taking
up
his
allotted
station
with
marvellous
precision
until
the
entire
space
set
apart
for
the
coming
ceremony
was
lined
with
treble
rows
of
troops
whose
armour
and
trappings
shone
like
silver
and
gold
in
the
brilliant
light
scarcely
had
the
soldiers
taken
up
their
position
when
a
long
procession
of
virgins
a
thousand
strong
all
clad
in
pure
white
raiment
carrying
flowers
and
branches
of
some
tree
emblematical
of
peace
came
along
walking
fourteen
abreast
nothing
could
exceed
the
loveliness
of
this
maiden
throng
as
they
assembled
in
a
grand
galaxy
of
beauty
in
front
of
the
troops
following
the
virgins
came
a
hundred
priests
dressed
in
black
robes
and
scarlet
sashes
bearing
incense
and
their
long
golden
rods
of
office
after
these
came
holy
echri
attended
by
four
of
his
sacred
brothers
then
a
high
minister
of
state
bearing
a
cushion
on
which
were
rolls
of
parchment
seals
and
a
sword
of
gold
and
then
again
another
hundred
priests
clad
in
purple
robes
and
yellow
sashes
then
came
all
the
high
ministers
of
state
and
representatives
of
various
cities
round
edos
accompanied
by
their
attendants
and
guards
of
honour
following
these
entered
doctor
hermann
and
sandy
escorted
by
a
posse
of
guards
attached
to
the
palace
under
the
command
of
our
old
friend
kaosp
reinstated
to
rank
but
a
few
hours
before
directly
after
them
came
another
band
of
music
playing
a
march
of
exceeding
beauty
heralding
the
approach
of
the
supported
by
temple
graham
appearance
sent
a
thrill
of
excitement
through
the
spectators
and
many
the
fair
lady
in
that
brilliant
throng
that
envied
volinè
her
good
fortune
in
mating
with
him
he
looked
in
the
very
prime
of
health
and
spirits
happy
in
the
full
pride
of
his
handsome
manhood
and
a
mighty
cheer
broke
simultaneously
from
a
hundred
thousand
people
who
remembered
his
undying
courage
at
remagaloth
and
his
matchless
gallantry
on
the
morning
of
that
very
day
in
deadly
conflict
with
perodii
the
excitement
caused
by
graham
arrival
had
scarcely
lulled
when
the
band
of
court
musicians
entered
playing
a
triumphal
air
followed
by
seventy
heralds
and
the
of
royalty
after
these
came
princesses
of
edos
the
number
being
symbolical
of
the
age
of
the
bride
each
strewing
flowers
as
they
walked
towards
the
altar
where
echri
and
his
four
attendant
priests
stood
waiting
then
excitement
and
enthusiasm
reached
their
highest
pitch
as
the
dear
old
king
of
gathma
appeared
with
volinè
his
daughter
the
leaning
upon
his
left
arm
followed
by
her
handmaidens
and
another
company
of
royal
troops
as
the
king
and
his
daughter
entered
every
one
of
that
dense
joyous
throng
rose
to
their
feet
and
deafening
shouts
of
loyalty
and
welcome
seemed
as
though
they
would
rend
the
hall
asunder
the
grandeur
and
brilliancy
of
the
scene
now
that
the
matchless
pageant
was
complete
beggar
all
description
the
sparkling
jewels
the
flashing
arms
and
armour
the
priests
the
hosts
of
virgins
the
flower
bearers
the
musicians
the
soldiers
in
their
uniforms
the
ministers
of
state
the
handsome
men
and
lovely
women
the
endless
officials
and
attendants
all
assisting
in
making
one
gorgeous
picture
one
scene
of
indescribable
beauty
in
which
the
fair
and
blushing
bride
shone
forth
like
a
peerless
pearl
in
all
her
maiden
loveliness
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
and
in
all
truth
she
merited
the
universal
tribute
of
admiration
so
spontaneously
showered
upon
her
clothed
in
a
flowing
robe
of
white
and
costly
fabric
neither
silk
nor
satin
yet
heavier
and
more
beautiful
than
either
whose
folds
suggested
although
they
covered
the
matchless
beauty
of
her
faultless
form
fastened
on
the
left
shoulder
and
studded
across
the
open
bosom
with
gems
of
sparkling
whiteness
and
girdled
round
the
waist
with
a
broad
scarf
or
sash
of
the
same
colour
embossed
upon
this
costly
robe
were
bunches
of
flowers
made
of
lustrous
gems
upon
her
head
was
a
diadem
of
the
same
white
fiery
stones
and
her
wealth
of
hair
hung
down
in
its
heavy
crimped
coils
of
golden
glory
blushes
suffused
her
cheeks
and
contrasted
well
with
her
snowy
brow
whilst
her
liquid
violet
eyes
shone
with
the
passionate
tenderness
of
a
subtle
desire
as
her
white
bosoms
rose
and
fell
in
responsive
harmony
to
the
great
joy
surging
and
swelling
within
her
heart
her
white
shapely
arms
were
bare
from
the
shoulder
and
round
each
wrist
was
a
broad
bracelet
of
fine
gold
united
by
a
slender
chain
of
the
same
precious
metal
which
hung
down
looped
nearly
to
her
feet
every
inch
a
peerless
queen
she
looked
as
she
stood
facing
the
altar
by
her
father
side
radiant
with
happiness
proud
in
her
conquest
and
conscious
of
her
victory
as
only
a
woman
can
be
who
weds
the
man
of
her
choice
for
love
in
a
few
moments
the
music
ceased
although
its
strains
were
already
drowned
in
the
tumult
to
all
but
those
standing
near
the
players
then
the
heralds
again
blew
blasts
upon
their
trumpets
as
a
signal
for
silence
and
as
the
last
echoes
of
their
brazen
call
died
away
echri
stepped
forward
and
said
brethren
we
are
assembled
here
to
celebrate
one
of
the
most
solemn
rites
of
our
holy
church
ye
to
witness
and
i
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
marriage
between
the
beloved
daughter
of
our
temporal
king
and
a
man
who
hath
journeyed
hither
from
the
earth
by
us
called
ramos
god
works
his
mighty
will
in
divers
ways
and
in
this
union
of
hearts
we
see
the
beginning
of
the
union
of
worlds
god
in
wondrous
apocalypse
hath
promised
this
united
universe
to
his
now
scattered
people
and
in
his
wisdom
hath
ordained
that
ramos
and
gathma
shall
first
be
linked
together
in
the
chain
that
is
to
spread
unbroken
round
creation
throughout
gathma
long
and
glorious
march
through
time
no
such
union
as
we
celebrate
hath
ever
been
it
is
an
epoch
in
our
history
and
is
pregnant
with
importance
to
the
peoples
that
dwell
on
ramos
and
on
here
more
than
usual
solemnity
hath
therefore
attached
itself
to
this
nuptial
rite
and
it
is
my
holy
duty
to
inspire
thoughts
among
ye
which
although
unusual
at
such
ceremonies
as
these
are
in
full
keeping
with
the
one
we
now
proceed
to
celebrate
echri
words
produced
a
great
effect
and
the
breathless
silence
was
even
painfully
intense
when
he
ceased
to
speak
at
this
point
the
king
turned
towards
echri
saying
it
is
scarcely
meet
of
me
to
interrupt
thy
holy
offices
but
as
thou
hast
well
said
this
ceremony
stands
in
our
annals
alone
and
that
being
so
i
command
indulgence
proceed
o
king
for
thy
words
are
wisdom
echri
answered
with
white
head
bowed
in
loyal
reverence
echri
as
thou
knowest
during
all
the
countless
ages
of
our
royal
race
it
hath
been
the
unvarying
custom
for
the
sons
and
daughters
of
our
ancient
and
illustrious
house
to
wed
with
those
of
high
degree
our
princes
have
taken
unto
themselves
princesses
to
wife
and
our
princesses
have
had
princes
found
them
for
husbands
our
beloved
daughter
shall
not
break
this
unchanging
edict
for
i
now
create
her
spouse
this
man
from
ramos
a
prince
of
our
royal
race
and
instal
him
here
and
now
with
all
the
rights
privileges
and
dignities
pertaining
to
such
rank
then
addressing
graham
who
stood
listening
to
the
king
words
in
bewilderment
he
continued
man
of
ramos
by
the
ordeal
of
fire
and
by
the
right
of
conquest
thou
hast
well
merited
the
honour
and
the
dignity
i
do
now
confer
upon
thee
no
longer
art
thou
harry
graham
of
earth
or
ramos
henceforth
as
prince
tihernah
of
edos
shalt
thou
be
known
and
taking
the
gold
sword
from
the
minister
standing
by
he
presented
it
to
graham
with
the
roll
of
parchment
and
the
seals
confirming
the
rank
to
which
he
had
just
been
exalted
graham
few
stammering
words
of
thanks
were
stopped
by
the
king
who
interrupting
him
smilingly
commanded
the
wedding
service
to
proceed
once
more
did
echri
step
forward
and
bade
volinè
and
graham
stand
side
by
side
before
him
at
the
altar
then
taking
the
slender
chain
of
fine
gold
which
connected
the
bracelets
on
volinè
wrists
he
commanded
graham
to
grasp
it
in
his
left
hand
and
to
break
it
asunder
saying
as
he
did
so
the
bondage
of
thy
maidenhood
this
man
hath
broken
henceforward
in
thy
state
of
wifehood
shalt
thou
only
cleave
to
him
and
him
only
who
hath
set
thee
free
volinè
doth
thou
enter
this
state
of
thine
own
will
and
prepared
to
abide
by
the
conditions
and
fulfil
the
duties
of
thy
sacred
office
as
wife
to
him
even
so
o
holy
father
prince
tihernah
thou
takest
this
maiden
unto
thee
of
thine
own
will
and
art
thou
prepared
to
abide
by
the
conditions
and
fulfil
the
duties
of
thy
sacred
office
as
husband
to
her
even
so
o
holy
father
then
echri
taking
volinè
left
hand
placed
it
in
graham
right
and
as
they
stood
thus
together
the
two
hundred
priests
commenced
to
swing
their
and
to
sing
a
solemn
chant
in
sweet
harmonious
voice
the
singing
and
the
having
ceased
one
of
the
aged
priests
attendant
on
echri
came
forward
and
gave
to
him
an
instrument
fashioned
very
like
a
lancet
but
with
a
long
carved
handle
of
solid
gold
embossed
with
gems
taking
volinè
right
hand
in
his
he
pricked
her
arm
below
the
elbow
so
that
blood
did
flow
yet
causing
her
no
apparent
pain
then
taking
graham
left
hand
he
proceeded
to
do
the
same
unto
him
and
when
the
blood
trickled
down
he
crossed
volinè
arm
and
his
letting
the
two
streams
of
blood
intermingle
in
a
tiny
crimson
torrent
blood
is
life
so
therefore
let
the
lives
of
this
man
and
maid
mingle
and
fuse
together
that
they
do
now
and
henceforward
until
death
be
one
may
the
arrows
of
god
wrath
all
they
who
seek
by
temptation
force
or
stealth
to
break
this
bond
asunder
and
may
his
holy
blessing
rest
upon
ye
both
as
well
as
upon
the
unborn
posterity
within
ye
for
man
and
wife
ye
have
now
become
this
was
all
yet
the
bridal
ceremony
was
solemn
and
imposing
to
a
degree
no
man
could
conceive
who
had
not
witnessed
it
as
soon
as
all
was
over
the
grand
procession
returned
in
the
order
that
it
entered
with
the
exception
that
volinè
walked
out
blushing
and
smiling
leaning
on
her
husband
arm
soon
afterwards
the
assembly
dispersed
themselves
and
the
grand
bridal
feast
was
served
to
a
thousand
special
guests
the
gay
and
festive
scene
at
the
bridal
banquet
was
little
less
imposing
than
the
nuptial
ceremony
the
bride
and
bridegroom
sat
on
the
king
right
hand
at
the
head
of
the
table
both
looking
supremely
happy
and
both
if
we
mistake
not
heartily
wishing
that
the
feast
was
over
and
they
could
enjoy
their
bliss
entirely
by
themselves
the
banquet
over
volinè
and
harry
had
yet
one
more
ordeal
to
pass
and
this
was
the
grand
procession
of
triumph
in
which
they
were
conducted
to
their
own
apartment
accompanied
by
the
strains
of
music
and
the
voice
of
song
by
virgins
emblematical
of
innocence
by
priests
and
officers
of
state
by
dames
and
nobles
all
according
to
ancient
custom
bent
upon
seeing
the
last
of
the
beautiful
bride
and
her
handsome
groom
at
their
chamber
threshold
here
we
draw
the
veil
before
the
consummation
of
highest
human
happiness
for
the
tender
passionate
secrets
of
the
bridal
chamber
are
too
sweet
and
too
holy
to
be
made
privy
of
all
men
footnote
this

the
last
words
from
yonder
days
and
weeks
have
come
and
gone
since
the
events
recorded
in
the
previous
chapter
for
seven
days
after
the
wedding
edos
was
entirely
given
up
to
feasting
to
rejoicing
and
to
revelry
of
graham
prince
tihernah
now
and
his
beautiful
wife
we
saw
little
during
this
interval
for
the
day
following
their
marriage
they
left
edos
to
spend
their
honeymoon
at
the
stately
dwelling
which
had
been
given
to
them
by
the
king
for
their
own
private
use
both
temple
and
the
doctor
have
come
in
for
their
share
of
honours
each
having
received
a
title
conferring
many
privileges
as
soon
as
the
actual
wedding
festivities
were
over
the
doctor
was
hard
at
work
again
busy
with
his
investigations
and
planning
out
in
microscopic
detail
project
after
project
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
humanity
he
was
a
very
titan
in
his
labours
he
had
called
together
under
the
direct
patronage
of
the
king
in
congress
all
the
leading
scientists
of
gathma
all
the
wise
men
of
helmath
deeply
skilled
in
the
arts
and
sciences
with
whom
he
discussed
his
plans
and
projects
the
greatest
and
the
most
important
of
these
was
one
for
establishing
regular
communication
between
earth
and
mars
his
views
were
accepted
by
his
scientific
compeers
with
the
wildest
enthusiasm
and
a
society
was
formed
forthwith
pledged
to
carry
out
the
daring
scheme
the
loss
of
the
did
not
prove
so
disastrous
after
all
there
are
cunning
artificers
and
skilful
engineers
in
many
parts
of
gathma
able
to
work
out
the
doctor
designs
with
even
greater
exactness
than
the
men
of
earth
another
point
vastly
favouring
the
plans
was
the
wonderful
development
of
electrical
science
a
branch
of
knowledge
only
in
its
infancy
on
earth
how
this
marvellous
force
has
become
utterly
subservient
to
human
will
in
gathma
has
been
dimly
hinted
at
in
many
parts
of
our
narrative
but
doctor
hermann
whether
wisely
or
not
has
deemed
it
best
to
say
little
until
we
return
to
our
native
earth
again
already
a
new
carriage
is
being
constructed
on
the
same
plan
as
the
but
embodying
many
improvements
some
of
them
the
result
of
our
experience
on
the
way
hither
others
the
suggestions
of
cleverer
engineers
than
we
several
years
must
of
necessity
elapse
before
the
grand
experiment
will
be
tried
as
the
doctor
is
anxious
to
acquire
as
much
information
as
possible
before
returning
already
his
years
of
life
begin
to
press
heavily
upon
him
and
he
feels
that
if
he
once
gets
back
to
earth
he
will
not
be
equal
to
the
hardships
and
the
risks
of
another
journey
here
younger
men
we
doubt
not
will
be
eager
and
willing
to
make
this
awful
plunge
across
the
sky
as
soon
as
the
tidings
of
our
glorious
success
reach
earth
and
they
are
put
in
possession
of
the
secrets
that
will
bear
them
triumphantly
here
and
now
as
these
manuscripts
already
exceed
in
bulk
and
weight
the
measure
that
has
been
allowed
them
by
doctor
hermann
in
his
calculations
when
making
the
machine
that
is
to
attempt
to
bear
them
to
earth
but
few
words
are
we
permitted
to
say
the
result
of
our
enterprise
has
been
one
unqualified
triumph
many
perils
many
hardships
many
dangers
have
been
encountered
and
have
been
overcome
as
the
reader
of
this
stirring
story
which
is
but
a
fragment
of
what
we
have
to
tell
already
knows
we
have
piles
upon
piles
of
manuscripts
dealing
with
scientific
social
and
religious
subjects
folios
upon
folios
of
sketches
portraying
objects
upon
which
the
eyes
of
earthly
man
have
never
rested
and
of
which
he
has
not
the
faintest
conception
a
few
of
these
we
send
with
this
not
only
are
we
enriched
with
the
knowledge
we
have
gained
for
ourselves
but
we
are
with
the
results
of
unnumbered
centuries
of
scientific
research
conducted
by
accomplished
philosophers
here
their
discoveries
in
the
science
of
astronomy
are
marvellous
and
make
us
look
upon
our
own
attainments
in
this
direction
with
supreme
pity
the
conditions
of
life
upon
this
planet
are
exceptionally
favourable
to
the
advancement
of
this
science
the
grand
age
of
the
astronomers
permitting
them
to
perfect
experiments
and
calculations
and
observe
phenomena
which
on
our
own
world
have
to
be
left
to
posterity
many
wondrous
things
have
they
told
us
of
the
movements
of
our
own
earth
not
the
least
remarkable
being
a
sudden
change
in
the
inclination
of
her
axis
four
thousand
two
hundred
and
years
ago
that
awful
catastrophe
as
we
read
in
our
own
holy
records
that
flooded
parts
of
the
world
even
to
the
summit
of
her
mountains
and
so
changed
the
conditions
of
life
upon
her
surface
that
all
creatures
that
dwell
thereon
have
not
recovered
and
never
will
recover
from
its
direful
results
never
can
we
forget
the
feelings
of
awe
that
crept
over
us
as
we
read
the
record
of
our
own
tribulation
and
woe
of
our
own
fall
from
physical
mightiness
to
nothingness
as
observed
actually
observed
by
those
men
of
gathma
who
scrutinised
the
heavens
with
such
wondrous
skill
in
days
when
the
science
of
the
firmament
with
us
still
lay
unquickened
in
the
womb
of
futurity
there
in
those
stirring
records
too
we
read
of
the
changing
aspect
of
our
own
polar
regions
as
viewed
from
gathma
more
than
thirty
millions
of
miles
away
of
how
the
polar
crescents
of
snow
spread
themselves
lower
and
lower
higher
and
higher
devastating
and
depopulating
continents
the
attainments
of
zoologists
are
none
the
less
grand
evolution
a
theory
that
only
dawned
on
earthly
minds
with
the
teaching
of
pythagoras
about
two
thousand
four
hundred
years
ago
and
was
only
elaborated
towards
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
of
the
christian
era
has
here
passed
from
speculation
into
fact
through
the
uninterrupted
researches
of
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
years
here
has
the
human
animal
confessed
his
glorious
unbroken
descent
from
lower
types
for
the
proofs
of
his
ancestry
are
complete
and
his
wondrous
descent
doth
only
magnify
his
creator
glory
in
his
sight
he
has
no
bigoted
past
to
wrestle
with
and
to
shake
his
reason
no
genesis
to
warp
his
judgment
or
to
stay
the
march
of
his
intellect
by
saying
things
are
so
since
time
began
man
wisdom
and
his
knowledge
are
false
even
to
summarise
our
impressions
of
this
beautiful
of
mars
or
gathma
would
require
the
space
already
taken
by
this
narrative
but
what
appealed
most
forcibly
to
us
after
a
long
sojourn
upon
its
fair
surface
was
the
vastness
and
stability
of
everything
its
freedom
from
crime
and
from
strife
the
crusted
age
of
all
its
institutions
and
customs
the
superiority
of
its
uniform
religious
dogma
over
our
own
divers
beliefs
the
calm
dignity
of
its
civilised
inhabitants
and
the
arrangement
of
all
things
to
harmonise
with
the
extraordinary
longevity
of
its
people
in
fine
it
is
a
world
at
the
very
zenith
of
its
long
and
gradually
accumulated
splendour
an
ideal
world
at
the
summit
of
its
glorious
course
which
can
only
be
described
as
the
bright
and
comely
heir
of
time
itself
having
witnessed
the
splendours
of
this
and
knowing
the
indescribable
benefits
which
may
accrue
to
the
men
of
earth
through
intercourse
with
its
people
we
are
anxious
that
our
fellows
shall
partake
and
that
speedily
of
the
riches
with
which
this
world
is
blessed
we
have
therefore
written
this
narrative
partly
as
a
message
of
hope
as
tidings
of
humanity
great
coming
joy
trusting
that
it
may
reach
earth
and
be
found
and
published
to
all
men
we
may
soon
follow
our
messenger
across
the
sky
even
by
the
time
that
it
falls
upon
the
surface
of
our
native
world
we
may
be
on
our
way
thereto
bringing
with
us
new
ideas
novel
inventions
from
the
planet
we
have
visited
we
reserve
the
disclosure
of
our
discoveries
and
our
secrets
until
we
reach
earth
again
for
we
feel
it
due
to
ourselves
that
we
should
proclaim
them
in
person
and
practical
john
temple
considers
that
we
should
at
least
receive
some
financial
return
for
the
information
it
has
cost
us
so
much
to
obtain
one
however
of
our
little
band
elects
to
remain
behind
in
gathma
graham
as
yet
evinces
no
desire
to
visit
his
native
world
the
tender
ties
that
bind
him
here
are
stronger
than
those
earthly
ones
which
may
still
linger
within
him
besides
we
hear
that
already
his
union
with
this
handsome
maid
of
edos
has
been
blessed
and
that
all
in
good
time
the
link
between
earth
and
here
will
be
forged
yet
more
strongly
in
volinè
maternity
two
days
after
the
above
lines
were
penned
temple
and
the
doctor
are
engaged
in
an
anxious
consultation
the
despatch
of
our
manuscripts
to
earth
forms
the
subject
of
discussion
the
piece
of
mechanism
lying
on
the
table
before
us
has
been
thoroughly
tested
and
proved
successful
it
is
a
small
electrical
engine
carrying
enough
motive
force
to
propel
it
beyond
the
limits
of
this
attraction
attached
to
a
cylinder
of
iron
in
which
our
precious
message
is
first
to
be
encased
and
then
the
two
halves
fixed
together
as
one
temple
if
we
can
only
get
our
messenger
far
enough
into
space
it
will
not
be
affected
by
attraction
here
and
the
next
body
that
should
draw
it
onwards
will
be
the
earth
well
i
have
but
to
add
a
few
more
lines
and
then
all
may
be
sealed
and
we
can
despatch
our
message
on
its
stupendous
flight
across
space
are
your
notes
complete
a
few
more
words
of
instruction
and
i
have
done
on
the
morrow
following
this
discussion
our
message
is
about
to
be
despatched
it
is
a
great
day
in
edos
from
far
and
wide
the
people
of
gathma
have
journeyed
hither
to
see
our
words
depart
in
two
time
we
seal
these
manuscripts
in
their
iron
covering
and
attach
them
to
the
motors
time
is
speeding
on
the
scene
around
us
here
is
a
curious
and
imposing
one
we
stand
upon
the
summit
of
one
of
the
hills
on
which
the
fair
city
of
edos
is
built
a
forge
and
brawny
smiths
who
have
come
hither
from
pamax
to
complete
our
task
are
in
the
foreground
the
king
surrounded
by
ministers
and
servants
by
princes
and
priests
watches
doctor
hermann
and
temple
with
heightening
wonderment
the
latter
busy
writing
these
few
last
words
volinè
and
her
husband
peer
over
shoulder
as
his
fluent
pen
races
across
the
sheets
of
white
paper
describing
this
closing
scene
a
dense
multitude
lines
the
background
equally
filled
with
curiosity
and
wonder
what
message
o
king
may
i
send
from
you
to
my
own
people
on
the
earth
said
temple
pausing
for
a
moment
and
turning
towards
the
king
of
gathma
a
message
of
peace
and
goodwill
tell
thy
brothers
yonder
that
the
hand
of
fellowship
is
reaching
out
towards
them
from
our
world
to
thine
and
that
great
things
shall
come
to
pass
for
their
good
and
ours
and
your
last
words
doctor
are
words
of
encouragement
to
the
men
of
science
at
home
to
my
dear
old
friend
darwin
i
especially
address
them
tell
my
brethren
that
i
long
to
be
amongst
them
once
more
to
tell
of
my
discoveries
and
to
increase
the
scope
of
their
labours
to
an
extent
they
have
hitherto
not
dared
even
to
dream
have
you
aught
to
say
graham
or
rather
prince
tihernah
said
temple
smiling
i
will
answer
for

said
volinè
playfully

the
dwellers
on
thy

that
when
the
carriage
which
this
message
heralds
doth
arrive
thereon
a
princess
of
the
royal
house
of
gathma

visit
them
let
it
be
as
you
say
darling
if
it
is
your
wish
to
visit
my
world
out
there
beyond
the
sky
then
will
i
relinquish
my
desire
to
remain
here
in
gathma
always
and
go
with
you
for
of
a
truth
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
deny
you
said
graham
his
eyes
filled
with
admiration
and
love
for
his
peerless
wife
we
are
now
about
to
place
this
last
page
of
our
manuscript
with
the
roll
of
others
in
