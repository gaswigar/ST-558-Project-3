the
robbers
by
frederich
schiller
schiller
preface
as
prefixed
to
the
first
edition
of
the
robbers
published
in
now
first
translated
into
english
this
play
is
to
be
regarded
merely
as
a
dramatic
narrative
in
which
for
the
purpose
of
tracing
out
the
innermost
workings
of
the
soul
advantage
has
been
taken
of
the
dramatic
method
without
otherwise
conforming
to
the
stringent
rules
of
theatrical
composition
or
seeking
the
dubious
advantage
of
stage
adaptation
it
must
be
admitted
as
somewhat
inconsistent
that
three
very
remarkable
people
whose
acts
are
dependent
on
perhaps
a
thousand
contingencies
should
be
completely
developed
within
three
hours
considering
that
it
would
scarcely
be
possible
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
that
three
such
remarkable
people
should
even
in
hours
fully
reveal
their
characters
to
the
most
penetrating
inquirer
a
greater
amount
of
incident
is
here
crowded
together
than
it
was
possible
for
me
to
confine
within
the
narrow
limits
prescribed
by
aristotle
and
batteux
it
is
however
not
so
much
the
bulk
of
my
play
as
its
contents
which
banish
it
from
the
stage
its
scheme
and
economy
require
that
several
characters
should
appear
who
would
offend
the
finer
feelings
of
virtue
and
shock
the
delicacy
of
our
manners
every
delineator
of
human
character
is
placed
in
the
same
dilemma
if
he
proposes
to
give
a
faithful
picture
of
the
world
as
it
really
is
and
not
an
ideal
phantasy
a
mere
creation
of
his
own
it
is
the
course
of
mortal
things
that
the
good
should
be
shadowed
by
the
bad
and
virtue
shine
the
brightest
when
contrasted
with
vice
whoever
proposes
to
discourage
vice
and
to
vindicate
religion
morality
and
social
order
against
their
enemies
must
unveil
crime
in
all
its
deformity
and
place
it
before
the
eyes
of
men
in
its
colossal
magnitude
he
must
diligently
explore
its
dark
mazes
and
make
himself
familiar
with
sentiments
at
the
wickedness
of
which
his
soul
revolts
vice
is
here
exposed
in
its
innermost
workings
in
francis
it
resolves
all
the
confused
terrors
of
conscience
into
wild
abstractions
destroys
virtuous
sentiments
by
dissecting
them
and
holds
up
the
earnest
voice
of
religion
to
mockery
and
scorn
he
who
has
gone
so
far
a
distinction
by
no
means
enviable
as
to
quicken
his
understanding
at
the
expense
of
his
soul
to
him
the
holiest
things
are
no
longer
holy
to
him
god
and
man
are
alike
indifferent
and
both
worlds
are
as
nothing
of
such
a
monster
i
have
endeavored
to
sketch
a
striking
and
lifelike
portrait
to
hold
up
to
abhorrence
all
the
machinery
of
his
scheme
of
vice
and
to
test
its
strength
by
contrasting
it
with
truth
how
far
my
narrative
is
successful
in
accomplishing
these
objects
the
reader
is
left
to
judge
my
conviction
is
that
i
have
painted
nature
to
the
life
next
to
this
man
francis
stands
another
who
would
perhaps
puzzle
not
a
few
of
my
readers
a
mind
for
which
the
greatest
crimes
have
only
charms
through
the
glory
which
attaches
to
them
the
energy
which
their
perpetration
requires
and
the
dangers
which
attend
them
a
remarkable
and
important
personage
abundantly
endowed
with
the
power
of
becoming
either
a
brutus
or
a
catiline
according
as
that
power
is
directed
an
unhappy
conjunction
of
circumstances
determines
him
to
choose
the
latter
for
his
example
and
it
is
only
after
a
fearful
straying
that
he
is
recalled
to
emulate
the
former
erroneous
notions
of
activity
and
power
an
exuberance
of
strength
which
bursts
through
all
the
barriers
of
law
must
of
necessity
conflict
with
the
rules
of
social
life
to
these
enthusiast
dreams
of
greatness
and
efficiency
it
needed
but
a
sarcastic
bitterness
against
the
unpoetic
spirit
of
the
age
to
complete
the
strange
don
quixote
whom
in
the
robber
moor
we
at
once
detest
and
love
admire
and
pity
it
is
i
hope
unnecessary
to
remark
that
i
no
more
hold
up
this
picture
as
a
warning
exclusively
to
robbers
than
the
greatest
spanish
satire
was
levelled
exclusively
at
it
is
nowadays
so
much
the
fashion
to
be
witty
at
the
expense
of
religion
that
a
man
will
hardly
pass
for
a
genius
if
he
does
not
allow
his
impious
satire
to
run
a
tilt
at
its
most
sacred
truths
the
noble
simplicity
of
holy
writ
must
needs
be
abused
and
turned
into
ridicule
at
the
daily
assemblies
of
the
wits
for
what
is
there
so
holy
and
serious
that
will
not
raise
a
laugh
if
a
false
sense
be
attached
to
it
let
me
hope
that
i
shall
have
rendered
no
inconsiderable
service
to
the
cause
of
true
religion
and
morality
in
holding
up
these
wanton
misbelievers
to
the
detestation
of
society
under
the
form
of
the
most
despicable
robbers
but
still
more
i
have
made
these
said
immoral
characters
to
stand
out
favorably
in
particular
points
and
even
in
some
measure
to
compensate
by
qualities
of
the
head
for
what
they
are
deficient
in
those
of
the
heart
herein
i
have
done
no
more
than
literally
copy
nature
every
man
even
the
most
depraved
bears
in
some
degree
the
impress
of
the
almighty
image
and
perhaps
the
greatest
villain
is
not
farther
removed
from
the
most
upright
man
than
the
petty
offender
for
the
moral
forces
keep
even
pace
with
the
powers
of
the
mind
and
the
greater
the
capacity
bestowed
on
man
the
greater
and
more
enormous
becomes
his
misapplication
of
it
the
more
responsible
is
he
for
his
errors
the
adramelech
of
klopstock
in
his
messiah
awakens
in
us
a
feeling
in
which
admiration
is
blended
with
detestation
we
follow
satan
with
shuddering
wonder
through
the
pathless
realms
of
chaos
the
medea
of
the
old
dramatists
is
in
spite
of
all
her
crimes
a
great
and
wondrous
woman
and
shakespeare
richard
iii
is
sure
to
excite
the
admiration
of
the
reader
much
as
he
would
hate
the
reality
if
it
is
to
be
my
task
to
portray
men
as
they
are
i
must
at
the
same
time
include
their
good
qualities
of
which
even
the
most
vicious
are
never
totally
destitute
if
i
would
warn
mankind
against
the
tiger
i
must
not
omit
to
describe
his
glossy
skin
lest
owing
to
this
omission
the
ferocious
animal
should
not
be
recognized
till
too
late
besides
this
a
man
who
is
so
utterly
depraved
as
to
be
without
a
single
redeeming
point
is
no
meet
subject
for
art
and
would
disgust
rather
than
excite
the
interest
of
the
reader
who
would
turn
over
with
impatience
the
pages
which
concern
him
a
noble
soul
can
no
more
endure
a
succession
of
moral
discords
than
the
musical
ear
the
grating
of
knives
upon
glass
and
for
this
reason
i
should
have
been
in
attempting
to
bring
my
drama
on
the
stage
a
certain
strength
of
mind
is
required
both
on
the
part
of
the
poet
and
the
reader
in
the
former
that
he
may
not
disguise
vice
in
the
latter
that
he
may
not
suffer
brilliant
qualities
to
beguile
him
into
admiration
of
what
is
essentially
detestable
whether
the
author
has
fulfilled
his
duty
he
leaves
others
to
judge
that
his
readers
will
perform
theirs
he
by
no
means
feels
assured
the
vulgar
among
whom
i
would
not
be
understood
to
mean
merely
the
rabble
the
vulgar
i
say
between
ourselves
extend
their
influence
far
around
and
unfortunately
set
the
fashion
too
shortsighted
to
reach
my
full
meaning
too
to
comprehend
the
largeness
of
my
views
too
disingenuous
to
admit
my
moral
aim
they
will
i
fear
almost
frustrate
my
good
intentions
and
pretend
to
discover
in
my
work
an
apology
for
the
very
vice
which
it
has
been
my
object
to
condemn
and
will
perhaps
make
the
poor
poet
to
whom
anything
rather
than
justice
is
usually
accorded
responsible
for
his
simplicity
thus
we
have
a
of
the
old
story
of
democritus
and
the
abderitans
and
our
worthy
hippocrates
would
needs
exhaust
whole
plantations
of
hellebore
were
it
proposed
to
remedy
this
mischief
by
a
healing
decoction
this
alludes
to
the
fable
amusingly
recorded
by
wieland
in
his
geschichte
der
abderiten
the
abderitans
who
were
a
byword
among
the
ancients
for
their
extreme
simplicity
are
said
to
have
sent
express
for
hipocrates
to
cure
their
great
townsman
democritus
whom
they
believed
to
be
out
of
his
senses
because
his
sayings
were
beyond
their
comprehension
hippocrates
on
conversing
with
democritus
having
at
once
discovered
that
the
cause
lay
with
themselves
assembled
the
senate
and
principal
inhabitants
in
the
with
the
promise
of
instructing
them
in
the
cure
of
democritus
he
then
banteringly
advised
them
to
import
six
shiploads
of
hellebore
of
the
very
best
quality
and
on
its
arrival
to
distribute
it
among
the
citizens
at
least
seven
pounds
per
head
but
to
the
senators
double
that
quantity
as
they
were
bound
to
have
an
extra
supply
of
sense
by
the
time
these
worthies
discovered
that
they
had
been
laughed
at
hippocrates
was
out
of
their
reach
the
story
in
wieland
is
infinitely
more
amusing
than
this
short
quotation
from
memory
enables
me
to
show
g
b
let
as
many
friends
of
truth
as
you
will
instruct
their
in
the
pulpit
and
on
the
stage
the
vulgar
will
never
cease
to
be
vulgar
though
the
sun
and
moon
may
change
their
course
and
heaven
and
earth
wax
old
as
a
garment
perhaps
in
order
to
please
people
i
might
have
been
less
true
to
nature
but
if
a
certain
beetle
of
whom
we
have
all
heard
could
extract
filth
even
from
pearls
if
we
have
examples
that
fire
has
destroyed
and
water
deluged
shall
therefore
pearls
fire
and
water
be
condemned
in
consequence
of
the
remarkable
catastrophe
which
ends
my
play
i
may
justly
claim
for
it
a
place
among
books
of
morality
for
crime
meets
at
last
with
the
punishment
it
deserves
the
lost
one
enters
again
within
the
pale
of
the
law
and
virtue
is
triumphant
whoever
will
but
be
courteous
enough
towards
me
to
read
my
work
through
with
a
desire
to
understand
it
from
him
i
may
expect
not
that
he
will
admire
the
poet
but
that
he
will
esteem
the
honest

fair
advertisement
to
the
robbers
as
communicated
by
schiller
to
dalberg
in
and
supposed
to
have
been
used
as
a
prologue
this
has
never
before
been
printed
with
any
of
the
the
picture
of
a
great
misguided
soul
endowed
with
every
gift
of
excellence
yet
lost
in
spite
of
all
its
gifts
unbridled
passions
and
bad
companionship
corrupt
his
heart
urge
him
on
from
crime
to
crime
until
at
last
he
stands
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
murderers
heaps
horror
upon
horror
and
plunges
from
precipice
to
precipice
into
the
lowest
depths
of
despair
great
and
majestic
in
misfortune
by
misfortune
reclaimed
and
led
back
to
the
paths
of
virtue
such
a
man
shall
you
pity
and
hate
abhor
yet
love
in
the
robber
moor
you
will
likewise
see
a
juggling
fiendish
knave
unmasked
and
blown
to
atoms
in
his
own
mines
a
fond
weak
and
father
the
sorrows
of
too
enthusiastic
love
and
the
tortures
of
ungoverned
passion
here
too
you
will
witness
not
without
a
shudder
the
interior
economy
of
vice
and
from
the
stage
be
taught
how
all
the
tinsel
of
fortune
fails
to
smother
the
inward
worm
and
how
terror
anguish
remorse
and
despair
tread
close
on
the
footsteps
of
guilt
let
the
spectator
weep
at
our
exhibition
and
tremble
and
learn
to
bend
his
passions
to
the
laws
of
religion
and
reason
let
the
youth
behold
with
alarm
the
consequences
of
unbridled
excess
nor
let
the
man
depart
without
imbibing
the
lesson
that
the
invisible
hand
of
providence
makes
even
villains
the
instruments
of
its
designs
and
judgments
and
can
marvellously
unravel
the
most
intricate
perplexities
of
fate
preface
to
the
second
edition
the
eight
hundred
copies
of
the
first
edition
of
my
robbers
were
exhausted
before
all
the
admirers
of
the
piece
were
supplied
a
second
was
therefore
undertaken
which
has
been
improved
by
greater
care
in
printing
and
by
the
omission
of
those
equivocal
sentences
which
were
offensive
to
the
more
fastidious
part
of
the
public
such
an
alteration
however
in
the
construction
of
the
play
as
should
satisfy
all
the
wishes
of
my
friends
and
critics
has
not
been
my
object
in
this
second
edition
the
several
songs
have
been
arranged
for
the
pianoforte
which
will
enhance
its
value
to
the
musical
part
of
the
public
i
am
indebted
for
this
to
an
able
composer
who
has
performed
his
task
in
so
masterly
a
manner
that
the
hearer
is
not
unlikely
to
forget
the
poet
in
the

of

what

you
have

that

that

that

add
ten
years
to

hurries
me
a

it
so
old
man
then
farewell
for

we
might
all

this
idiom
is
very
common
in

express
affliction

short
step

of
torture
to
you
i
can
gather
from
a
hundred
of
your
letters
how
tidings
such
as
these
must
pierce
your
fraternal
heart
it
seems
to
me
as
though
i
saw
thee
for
the
sake
of
this
worthless
this
detestable
old
covers
his
face
oh
my
father
i
am
only
reading
you
the
mildest
passages
this
detestable
man
shedding
a
thousand
tears
alas
mine
flowed
ay
gushed
in
torrents
over
these
pitying
cheeks
i
already
picture
to
myself
your
aged
pious
father
pale
as
death
good
heavens
and
so
you
are
before
you
have
heard
anything
old
go
on
go
on
francis
pale
as
death
sinking
down
on
his
chair
and
cursing
the
day
when
his
ear
was
first
greeted
with
the
lisping
cry
of
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
discover
all
and
of
the
little
i
do
know
i
dare
tell
you
only
a
part
your
brother
now
seems
to
have
filled
up
the
measure
of
his
infamy
i
at
least
can
imagine
nothing
beyond
what
he
has
already
accomplished
but
possibly
his
genius
may
soar
above
my
conceptions
after
having
contracted
debts
to
the
amount
of
forty
thousand
ducats
a
good
round
sum
for
father
and
having
dishonored
the
daughter
of
a
rich
banker
whose
affianced
lover
a
gallant
youth
of
rank
he
mortally
wounded
in
a
duel
he
yesterday
in
the
dead
of
night
took
the
desperate
resolution
of
absconding
from
the
arm
of
justice
with
seven
companions
whom
he
had
corrupted
to
his
own
vicious
courses
father
for
heaven
sake
father
how
do
you
feel
old
enough
no
more
my
son
no
more
francis
i
will
spare
your
feelings
the
injured
cry
aloud
for
satisfaction
warrants
have
been
issued
for
his
apprehension
a
price
is
set
on
his
head
the
name
of
moor
no
these
unhappy
lips
shall
not
be
guilty
of
a
father
murder
he
tears
the
letter
believe
it
not
my
father
believe
not
a
syllable
old
weeps
bitterly
my
name
my
unsullied
name
francis
throws
himself
on
his
neck
infamous
most
infamous
charles
oh
had
i
not
my
forebodings
when
even
as
a
boy
he
would
scamper
after
the
girls
and
ramble
about
over
hill
and
common
with
ragamuffin
boys
and
all
the
vilest
rabble
when
he
shunned
the
very
sight
of
a
church
as
a
malefactor
shuns
a
gaol
and
would
throw
the
pence
he
had
wrung
from
your
bounty
into
the
hat
of
the
first
beggar
he
met
whilst
we
at
home
were
edifying
ourselves
with
devout
prayers
and
pious
homilies
had
i
not
my
misgivings
when
he
gave
himself
up
to
reading
the
adventures
of
julius
caesar
alexander
the
great
and
other
benighted
heathens
in
preference
to
the
history
of
the
penitent
tobias
a
hundred
times
over
have
i
warned
you
for
my
brotherly
affection
was
ever
kept
in
subjection
to
filial
duty
that
this
forward
youth
would
one
day
bring
sorrow
and
disgrace
on
us
all
oh
that
he
bore
not
the
name
of
moor
that
my
heart
beat
less
warmly
for
him
this
sinful
affection
which
i
can
not
overcome
will
one
day
rise
up
against
me
before
the
of
heaven
old
oh
my
prospects
my
golden
dreams
francis
ay
well
i
knew
it
exactly
what
i
always
feared
that
fiery
spirit
you
used
to
say
which
is
kindling
in
the
boy
and
renders
him
so
susceptible
to
impressions
of
the
beautiful
and
grand
the
ingenuousness
which
reveals
his
whole
soul
in
his
eyes
the
tenderness
of
feeling
which
melts
him
into
weeping
sympathy
at
every
tale
of
sorrow
the
manly
courage
which
impels
him
to
the
summit
of
giant
oaks
and
urges
him
over
fosse
and
palisade
and
foaming
torrents
that
youthful
thirst
of
honor
that
unconquerable
resolution
all
those
resplendent
virtues
which
in
the
father
darling
gave
such
promise
would
ripen
into
the
warm
and
sincere
friend
the
excellent
citizen
the
hero
the
great
the
very
great
man
now
mark
the
result
father
the
fiery
spirit
has
developed
itself
expanded
and
behold
its
precious
fruits
observe
this
ingenuousness
how
nicely
it
has
changed
into
effrontery
this
tenderness
of
soul
how
it
displays
itself
in
dalliance
with
coquettes
in
susceptibility
to
the
blandishments
of
a
courtesan
see
this
fiery
genius
how
in
six
short
years
it
hath
burnt
out
the
oil
of
life
and
reduced
his
body
to
a
living
skeleton
so
that
passing
scoffers
point
at
him
with
a
sneer
and
exclaim
qui
a
fait
behold
this
bold
enterprising
spirit
how
it
conceives
and
executes
plans
compared
to
which
the
deeds
of
a
cartouche
or
a
howard
sink
into
insignificance
and
presently
when
these
precious
germs
of
excellence
shall
ripen
into
full
maturity
what
may
not
be
expected
from
the
full
development
of
such
a
boyhood
perhaps
father
you
may
yet
live
to
see
him
at
the
head
of
some
gallant
band
which
assembles
in
the
silent
sanctuary
of
the
forest
and
kindly
relieves
the
weary
traveller
of
his
superfluous
burden
perhaps
you
may
yet
have
the
opportunity
before
you
go
to
your
own
tomb
of
making
a
pilgrimage
to
the
monument
which
he
may
erect
for
himself
somewhere
between
earth
and
heaven
perhaps
oh
father
father
look
out
for
some
other
name
or
the
very
peddlers
and
street
boys
who
have
seen
the
effigy
of
your
worthy
son
exhibited
in
the
at
leipsic
will
point
at
you
with
the
finger
of
scorn
old
and
thou
too
my
francis
thou
too
oh
my
children
how
unerringly
your
shafts
are
levelled
at
my
heart
francis
you
see
that
i
too
have
a
spirit
but
my
spirit
bears
the
sting
of
a
scorpion
and
then
it
was
the
dry
commonplace
the
cold
the
wooden
francis
and
all
the
pretty
little
epithets
which
the
contrast
between
us
suggested
to
your
fatherly
affection
when
he
was
sitting
on
your
knee
or
playfully
patting
your
cheeks
he
would
die
forsooth
within
the
boundaries
of
his
own
domain
moulder
away
and
soon
be
forgotten
while
the
fame
of
this
universal
genius
would
spread
from
pole
to
pole
ah
the
cold
dull
wooden
francis
thanks
thee
heaven
with
uplifted
hands
that
he
bears
no
resemblance
to
his
brother
old
forgive
me
my
child
reproach
not
thy
unhappy
father
whose
fondest
hopes
have
proved
visionary
the
merciful
god
who
through
charles
has
sent
these
tears
will
through
thee
my
francis
wipe
them
from
my
eyes
francis
yes
father
we
will
wipe
them
from
your
eyes
your
francis
will
devote
his
life
to
prolong
yours
taking
his
hand
with
affected
tenderness
your
life
is
the
oracle
which
i
will
especially
consult
on
every
undertaking
the
mirror
in
which
i
will
contemplate
everything
no
duty
so
sacred
but
i
am
ready
to
violate
it
for
the
preservation
of
your
precious
days
you
believe
me
old
great
are
the
duties
which
devolve
on
thee
my
son
heaven
bless
thee
for
what
thou
has
been
and
wilt
be
to
me
francis
now
tell
me
frankly
father
should
you
not
be
a
happy
man
were
you
not
obliged
to
call
this
son
your
own
old
in
mercy
spare
me
when
the
nurse
first
placed
him
in
my
arms
i
held
him
up
to
heaven
and
exclaimed
am
i
not
truly
blest
francis
so
you
said
then
now
have
you
found
it
so
you
may
envy
the
meanest
peasant
on
your
estate
in
this
that
he
is
not
the
father
of
such
a
son
so
long
as
you
call
him
yours
you
are
wretched
your
misery
will
grow
with
his
years
it
will
lay
you
in
your
grave
old
oh
he
has
already
reduced
me
to
the
decrepitude
of
fourscore
francis
well
then
suppose
you
were
to
disown
this
son
old
startled
francis
francis
what
hast
thou
said
francis
is
not
your
love
for
him
the
source
of
all
your
grief
root
out
this
love
and
he
concerns
you
no
longer
but
for
this
weak
and
reprehensible
affection
he
would
be
dead
to
you
as
though
he
had
never
been
born
it
is
not
flesh
and
blood
it
is
the
heart
that
makes
us
sons
and
fathers
love
him
no
more
and
this
monster
ceases
to
be
your
son
though
he
were
cut
out
of
your
flesh
he
has
till
now
been
the
apple
of
your
eye
but
if
thine
eye
offend
you
says
scripture
pluck
it
out
it
is
better
to
enter
heaven
with
one
eye
than
hell
with
two
it
is
profitable
for
thee
that
one
of
thy
members
should
perish
and
not
that
thy
whole
body
should
be
cast
into
hell
these
are
the
words
of
the
bible
old
wouldst
thou
have
me
curse
my
son
francis
by
no
means
father
god
forbid
but
whom
do
you
call
your
son
him
to
whom
you
have
given
life
and
who
in
return
does
his
utmost
to
shorten
yours
old
oh
it
is
all
too
true
it
is
a
judgment
upon
me
the
lord
has
chosen
him
as
his
instrument
francis
see
how
filially
your
bosom
child
behaves
he
destroys
you
by
your
own
excess
of
paternal
sympathy
murders
you
by
means
of
the
very
love
you
bear
him
has
coiled
round
a
father
heart
to
crush
it
when
you
are
laid
beneath
the
turf
he
becomes
lord
of
your
possessions
and
master
of
his
own
will
that
barrier
removed
and
the
torrent
of
his
profligacy
will
rush
on
without
control
imagine
yourself
in
his
place
how
often
he
must
wish
his
father
under
ground
and
how
often
too
his
brother
who
so
unmercifully
impede
the
free
course
of
his
excesses
but
call
you
this
a
requital
of
love
is
this
filial
gratitude
for
a
father
tenderness
to
sacrifice
ten
years
of
your
life
to
the
lewd
pleasures
of
an
hour
in
one
voluptuous
moment
to
stake
the
honor
of
an
ancestry
which
has
stood
unspotted
through
seven
centuries
do
you
call
this
a
son
answer
do
you
call
this
your
son
old
an
undutiful
son
alas
but
still
my
child
my
child
francis
a
most
amiable
and
precious
child
whose
constant
study
is
to
get
rid
of
his
father
oh
that
you
could
learn
to
see
clearly
that
the
film
might
be
removed
from
your
eyes
but
your
indulgence
must
confirm
him
in
his
vices
your
assistance
tend
to
justify
them
doubtless
you
will
avert
the
curse
of
heaven
from
his
head
but
on
your
own
father
on
yours
will
it
fall
with
twofold
vengeance
old
just
most
just
mine
mine
be
all
the
guilt
francis
how
many
thousands
who
have
drained
the
voluptuous
bowl
of
pleasure
to
the
dregs
have
been
reclaimed
by
suffering
and
is
not
the
bodily
pain
which
follows
every
excess
a
manifest
declaration
of
the
divine
will
and
shall
man
dare
to
thwart
this
by
an
impious
exercise
of
affection
shall
a
father
ruin
forever
the
pledge
committed
to
his
charge
consider
father
if
you
abandon
him
for
a
time
to
the
pressure
of
want
will
not
he
be
obliged
to
turn
from
his
wickedness
and
repent
otherwise
untaught
even
in
the
great
school
of
adversity
he
must
remain
a
confirmed
reprobate
and
then
woe
to
the
father
who
by
a
culpable
tenderness
bath
frustrated
the
ordinances
of
a
higher
wisdom
well
father
old
i
will
write
to
him
that
i
withdraw
my
protection
francis
that
would
be
wise
and
prudent
old
that
he
must
never
come
into
my
sight
again
francis
have
a
most
salutary
effect
old
tenderly
until
he
reforms
francis
right
quite
right
but
suppose
that
he
comes
disguised
in
the
hypocrite
mask
implores
your
compassion
with
tears
and
wheedles
from
you
a
pardon
then
quits
you
again
on
the
morrow
and
jests
at
your
weakness
in
the
arms
of
his
harlot
no
my
father
he
will
return
of
his
own
accord
when
his
conscience
awakens
him
to
repentance
old
i
will
write
to
him
on
the
spot
to
that
effect
francis
stop
father
one
word
more
your
just
indignation
might
prompt
reproaches
too
severe
words
which
might
break
his
heart
and
then
do
you
not
think
that
your
deigning
to
write
with
your
own
hand
might
be
construed
into
an
act
of
forgiveness
it
would
be
better
i
think
that
you
should
commit
the
task
to
me
old
do
it
my
son
ah
it
would
indeed
have
broken
my
heart
write
to
him
that
francis
quickly
that
agreed
then
old
say
that
he
has
caused
me
a
thousand
bitter
tears
a
thousand
sleepless
nights
but
oh
do
not
drive
my
son
to
despair
francis
had
you
not
better
retire
to
rest
father
this
affects
you
too
strongly
old
write
to
him
that
a
father
heart
but
i
charge
you
drive
him
not
to
despair
exit
in
sadness
francis
looking
after
him
with
a
chuckle
make
thyself
easy
old
dotard
thou
wilt
never
more
press
thy
darling
to
thy
bosom
there
is
a
gulf
between
thee
and
him
impassable
as
heaven
is
from
hell
he
was
torn
from
thy
arms
before
even
thou
couldst
have
dreamed
it
possible
to
decree
the
separation
why
what
a
sorry
bungler
should
i
be
had
i
not
skill
enough
to
pluck
a
son
from
a
father
heart
ay
though
he
were
riveted
there
with
hooks
of
steel
i
have
drawn
around
thee
a
magic
circle
of
curses
which
he
can
not
overleap
good
speed
to
thee
master
francis
papa
darling
is
disposed
of
the
course
is
clear
i
must
carefully
pick
up
all
the
scraps
of
paper
for
how
easily
might
my
handwriting
be
recognized
he
gathers
the
fragments
of
the
letter
and
grief
will
soon
make
an
end
of
the
old
gentleman
and
as
for
her
i
must
tear
this
charles
from
her
heart
though
half
her
life
come
with
him
no
small
cause
have
i
for
being
dissatisfied
with
dame
nature
and
by
my
honor
i
will
have
amends
why
did
i
not
crawl
the
first
from
my
mother
womb
why
not
the
only
one
why
has
she
heaped
on
me
this
burden
of
deformity
on
me
especially
just
as
if
she
had
spawned
me
from
her
refuse
why
to
me
in
particular
this
snub
of
the
laplander
these
negro
lips
these
hottentot
eyes
on
my
word
the
lady
seems
to
have
collected
from
all
the
race
of
mankind
whatever
was
loathsome
into
a
heap
and
kneaded
the
mass
into
my
particular
person
death
and
destruction
who
empowered
her
to
deny
to
me
what
she
accorded
to
him
could
a
man
pay
his
court
to
her
before
he
was
born
or
offend
her
before
he
existed
why
went
she
to
work
in
such
a
partial
spirit
no
no
i
do
her
injustice
she
bestowed
inventive
faculty
and
set
us
naked
and
helpless
on
the
shore
of
this
great
ocean
the
world
let
those
swim
who
can
the
may
sink
to
me
she
gave
naught
else
and
how
to
make
the
best
use
of
my
endowment
is
my
present
business
men
natural
rights
are
equal
claim
is
met
by
claim
effort
by
effort
and
force
by
force
right
is
with
the
strongest
the
limits
of
our
power
constitute
our
laws
it
is
true
there
are
certain
organized
conventions
which
men
have
devised
to
keep
up
what
is
called
the
social
compact
honor
truly
a
very
convenient
coin
which
those
who
know
how
to
pass
it
may
lay
out
with
great
advantage
conscience
oh
yes
a
useful
scarecrow
to
frighten
sparrows
away
from
it
is
something
like
a
fairly
written
bill
of
exchange
with
which
your
bankrupt
merchant
staves
off
the
evil
day
see
richard
act
i
sc
line
is
used
in
a
double
meaning
the
german
word
is
plump
which
means
lumpish
clumsy
awkward
falstaff
hen
pt
act
sc
honor
is
a
mere
scutcheon
well
these
are
all
most
admirable
institutions
for
keeping
fools
in
awe
and
holding
the
mob
underfoot
that
the
cunning
may
live
the
more
at
their
ease
rare
institutions
doubtless
they
are
something
like
the
fences
my
boors
plant
so
closely
to
keep
out
the
hares
yes
i
faith
not
a
hare
can
trespass
on

enclosure
but
my
lord

cupid

the

i
to

it
is
the
tailor
affair
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
twaddle
about
the
ties
of
blood
enough
to
make
a
sober
man
beside
himself
he
is
your
brother
they
say
which
interpreted
means
that
he
was
manufactured
in
the
same
mould
and
for
that
reason
he
must
needs
be
sacred
in
your
eyes
to
what
absurd
conclusions
must
this
notion
of
a
sympathy
of
souls
derived
from
the
propinquity
of
bodies
inevitably
tend
a
common
source
of
being
is
to
produce
community
of
sentiment
identity
of
matter
identity
of
impulse
then
again
he
is
thy
father
he
gave
thee
life
thou
art
his
flesh
and
blood
and
therefore
he
must
be
sacred
to
thee
again
a
most
inconsequential
deduction
i
should
like
to
know
why
he
begot
me
certainly
not
out
of
love
for
me
for
i
must
first
have
existed
the
reader
of
sterne

remember
a
very
similar
passage
in

first
chapter
of
tristram
shandy
could
he
know
me
before
i
had
being
or
did
he
think
of
me
during
my
begetting
or
did
he
wish
for
me
at
the
moment
did
he
know
what
i
should
be
if
so
i
would
not
advise
him
to
acknowledge
it
or
i
should
pay
him
off
for
his
feat
am
i
to
be
thankful
to
him
that
i
am
a
man
as
little
as
i
should
have
had
a
right
to
blame
him
if
he
had
made
me
a
woman
can
i
acknowledge
an
affection
which
is
not
based
on
any
personal
regard
could
personal
regard
be
present
before
the
existence
of
its
object
in
what
then
consists
the
sacredness
of
paternity
is
it
in
the
act
itself
out
of
which
existence
arose
as
though
this
were
aught
else
than
an
animal
process
to
appease
animal
desires
or
does
it
lie
perhaps
in
the
result
of
this
act
which
is
nothing
more
after
all
than
one
of
iron
necessity
and
which
men
would
gladly
dispense
with
were
it
not
at
the
cost
of
flesh
and
blood
do
i
then
owe
him
thanks
for
his
affection
why
what
is
it
but
a
piece
of
vanity
the
besetting
sin
of
the
artist
who
admires
his
own
works
however
hideous
they
may
be
look
you
this
is
the
whole
juggle
wrapped
up
in
a
mystic
veil
to
work
on
our
fears
and
shall

too
be
fooled

an
infant
up
then

to
thy

will
root

my

off

you
by
way

revenge
proclaimed
a
fast
through
the
whole
town
they
fumed
and
fretted
at
your
edict
but
you
without
losing
time
ordered
all
the
meat
to

up
in

that
in

eight
hours

not
a

even

the

council
vowed
vengeance

we

turned
out
lustily
seventeen
hundred
of
us
with
you
at
our
head
and
butchers
and
tailors
and
haberdashers
at

besides
publicans
barbers

of
all
sorts
swearing
that
the
town
should
be
sacked
if
a
single
hair
of
a

head
was
injured

the
affair
went
off

the
shooting
at
hornberg
and
they
were
obliged
to
be
off

their
tails

the
shooting
at

is
a
proverbial
expression
in
germany
for
any
expedition
from
which
through
lack
of
courage
the
parties
retire
without
firing
a
shot
you
sent
for
doctors
a
whole
posse

them
and
offered
three
ducats
to
any
one
who
would
write
a
prescription
for

were

the

would
stand
too
much
upon
honor

refuse
and
had
already
made
up
our
minds
to
use
force
but
this
was
quite
unnecessary
the
doctors
got
to
fisticuffs
for
the
three
ducats
and
their
competition
brought
down
the
price
to
three
groats
in
the

hour
a
dozen

were
written

acknowledgments

kind
sympathy

ordered

poverty
which
has
brought
you
to
this

let
me
tell

a
little
story
of
my
youthful
days
there
was
a
ditch
close
to
my
house
eight
feet
wide
at
the
least
which
we
boys
were
trying
to
leap
over
for
a
wager
but
it
was
no
go
splash
there
you
lay
sprawling
amidst
hisses
and
roars
of
laughter
and
a
relentless
shower
of
snowballs
by
the
side
of
my
house
a
hunter
dog
was
lying
chained
a
savage
beast
which
would
catch
the
girls
by
their
petticoats
with
the
quickness
of
lightning
if
they
incautiously
passed
too
near
him
now
it
was
my
greatest
delight
to
tease
this
brute
in
every
possible
way
and
it
was
enough
to
make
one
burst
with
laughing
to
see
the
beast
fix
his
eyes
on
me
with
such
fierceness
that
he
seemed
ready
to
tear
me
to
pieces
if
he
could
but
get
at
me
well
what
happened
once
when
i
was
amusing
myself
in
this
manner
i
hit
him
such
a
bang
in
the
ribs
with
a
stone
that
in
his
fury
he
broke
loose
and
ran
right
upon
me
i
tore
away
like
lightning
but
devil
take
it
that
confounded
ditch
lay
right
in
my
way
what
was
to
be
done
the
dog
was
close
at
my
heels
and
quite
furious
there
was
no
time
to
deliberate
i
took
a
spring
and
cleared
the
ditch
to
that
leap
i
was
indebted
for
life
and
limb
the
beast
would
have
torn
me
to
atoms
charles
von
and
to
what
does
all
this
tend
spiegel
to
this
that
you
may
be
taught
that
strength
grows
with
the
occasion
for
which
reason
i
never
despair
even
when
things
are
the
worst
courage
grows
with
danger
powers
of
resistance
increase
by
pressure
it
is
evident
by
the
obstacles

strews
in
my
path

fate

have

me
for

great

like

he
stood
before

waking
he
filled
your

dreaming
the
whole
creation
seemed
to
thee
to
centre
in
charles
and
to
reflect
him
alone
it
gave
thee
no
other
echo
but
of
him
amelia
with
emotion
yes
verily
i
own
it
despite
of
you
all
barbarians
as
you
are
i
will
own
it
before
all
the
world
i
love
him
francis
inhuman
cruel
so
to
requite
a
love
like
this
to
forget
her

starting
what
forget
me
francis
did
you
not
place
a
ring
on
his
finger
a
diamond
ring
the
pledge
of
your
love
to
be
sure
how
is
it
possible
for
youth
to
resist
the
fascinations
of
a
wanton
who
can
blame
him
for
it
since
he
had
nothing
else
left
to
give
away
and
of
course
she
repaid
him
with
interest
by
her
caresses
and
embraces
amelia
with
indignation
my
ring
to
a
wanton
francis
fie
fie
it
is
disgraceful
not
be
much
however
if
that
were
all
a
ring
be
it
ever
so
costly
is
after
all
a
thing
which
one
may
always
buy
of
a
jew
perhaps
the
fashion
of
it
did
not
please
him
perhaps
he
exchanged
it
for
one
more
beautiful
amelia
with
violence
but
my
ring
i
say
my
ring
francis
even
yours
amelia
ha
such
a
brilliant
and
on
my
finger
and
from
amelia
death
itself
should
not
have
plucked
it
hence
it
is
not
the
costliness
of
the
diamond
not
the
cunning
of
the
pattern
it
is
love
which
constitutes
its
value
is
it
not
so
amelia
dearest
child
you
are
weeping
woe
be
to
him
who
causes
such
precious
drops
to
flow
from
those
heavenly
eyes
ah
and
if
you
knew
all
if
you
could
but
see
him
yourself
see
him
under
that
form
amelia
monster
what
do
you
mean
what
form
do
you
speak
of
francis
hush
hush
gentle
soul
press
me
no
further
as
if
soliloquizing
yet
aloud
if
it
had
only
some
veil
that
horrid
vice
under
which
it
might
shroud
itself
from
the
eye
of
the
world
but
there
it
is
glaring
horribly
through
the
sallow
leaden
eye
proclaiming
itself
in
the
sunken
deathlike
look
ghastly
protruding
bones
the
faltering
hollow
voice
preaching
audibly
from
the
shattered
shaking
skeleton
piercing
to
the
most
vital
marrow
of
the
bones
and
sapping
the
manly
strength
of
youth
faugh
the
idea
sickens
me
nose
eyes
ears
shrink
from
it
you
saw
that
miserable
wretch
amelia
in
our
hospital
who
was
heavily
breathing
out
his
spirit
modesty
seemed
to
cast
down
her
abashed
eye
as
she
passed
him
you
cried
woe
upon
him
recall
that
hideous
image
to
your
mind
and
your
charles
stands
before
you
his
kisses
are
pestilence
his
lips
poison
amelia
strikes
him
shameless
liar
francis
does
such
a
charles
inspire
you
with
horror
does
the
mere
picture
fill
you
with
disgust
go
then
gaze
upon
him
yourself
your
handsome
your
angelic
your
divine
charles
go
drink
his
balmy
breath
and
revel
in
the
ambrosial
fumes
which
ascend
from
his
throat
the
very
exhalations
of
his
body
will
plunge
you
into
that
dark
and
deathlike
dizziness
which
follows
the
smell
of
a
bursting
carcase
or
the
sight
of
a
amelia
turns
away
her
face
what
sensations
of
love
what
rapture
in
those
embraces
but
is
it
not
unjust
to
condemn
a
man
because
of
his
diseased
exterior
even
in
the
most
wretched
lump
of
deformity
a
soul
great
and
worthy
of
love
may
beam
forth
brightly
like
a
pearl
on
a
dunghill
with
a
malignant
smile
even
from
lips
of
corruption
love
may
to
be
sure
if
vice
should
undermine
the
very
foundations
of
character
if
with
chastity
virtue
too
should
take
her
flight
as
the
fragrance
departs
from
the
faded
rose
if
with
the
body
the
soul
too
should
be
tainted
and
corrupted
amelia
rising
joyfully
ha
charles
now
i
recognize
thee
again
thou
art
whole
whole
it
was
all
a
lie
dost
thou
not
know
miscreant
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
charles
to
be
the
being
you
describe
francis
remains
standing
for
some
time
lost
in
thought
then
suddenly
turns
round
to
go
away
whither
are
you
going
in
such
haste
are
you
flying
from
your
own
infamy
francis
hiding
his
face
let
me
go
let
me
go
to
give
free
vent
to
my
tears
tyrannical
father
thus
to
abandon
the
best
of
your
sons
to
misery
and
disgrace
on
every
side
let
me
go
amelia
i
will
throw
myself
at
his
feet
on
my
knees
i
will
conjure
him
to
transfer
to
me
the
curse
that
he
has
pronounced
to
disinherit
me
to
hate
me
my
blood
my
life
my
all
amelia
falls
on
his
neck
brother
of
my
charles
dearest
most
excellent
francis
francis
oh
amelia
how
i
love
you
for
this
unshaken
constancy
to
my
brother
forgive
me
for
venturing
to
subject
your
love
to
so
severe
a
trial
how
nobly
you
have
realized
my
wishes
by
those
tears
those
sighs
that
divine
indignation
and
for
me
too
for
me
our
souls
did
so
truly
harmonize
amelia
oh
no
that
they
never
did
francis
alas
they
harmonized
so
truly
that
i
always
thought
we
must
be
twins
and
were
it
not
for
that
unfortunate
difference
in
person
to
be
which
it
must
be
admitted
would
be
to
the
disadvantage
of
charles
we
should
again
and
again
be
mistaken
for
each
other
thou
art
i
often
said
to
myself
thou
art
the
very
charles
his
echo
his
counterpart
amelia
shakes
her
head
no
no
by
that
chaste
light
of
heaven
not
an
atom
of
him
not
the
least
spark
of
his
soul
francis
so
entirely
the
same
in
our
dispositions
the
rose
was
his
favorite
flower
and
what
flower
do
i
esteem
above
the
rose
he
loved
music
beyond
expression
and
ye
are
witnesses
ye
stars
how
often
you
have
listened
to
me
playing
on
the
harpsichord
in
the
dead
silence
of
night
when
all
around
lay
buried
in
darkness
and
slumber
and
how
is
it
possible
for
you
amelia
still
to
doubt
if
our
love
meets
in
one
perfection
and
if
it
is
the
love
how
can
its
fruits
degenerate
amelia
looks
at
him
with
astonishment
it
was
a
calm
serene
evening
the
last
before
his
departure
for
leipzic
when
he
took
me
with
him
to
the
bower
where
you
so
often
sat
together
in
dreams
of
love
we
were
long
speechless
at
last
he
seized
my
hand
and
said
in
a
low
voice
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
i
am
leaving
amelia
i
know
not
but
i
have
a
sad
presentiment
that
it
is
forever
forsake
her
not
brother
be
her
friend
her
charles
if
charles
should
never
never
return
he
throws
himself
down
before
her
and
kisses
her
hand
with
fervor
never
never
never
will
he
return
and
i
stand
pledged
by
a
sacred
oath
to
fulfil
his
behest
amelia
starting
back
traitor
now
thou
art
unmasked
in
that
very
bower
he
conjured
me
if
he
died
to
admit
no
other
love
dost
thou
see
how
impious
how
execrable
quit
my
sight
francis
you
know
me
not
amelia
you
do
not
know
me
in
the
least
amelia
oh
yes
i
know
you
from
henceforth
i
know
you
and
you
pretend
to
be
like
him
you
mean
to
say
that
he
wept
for
me
in
your
presence
yours
he
would
sooner
have
inscribed
my
name
on
the
pillory
begone
this
instant
francis
you
insult
me
amelia
go
i
say
you
have
robbed
me
of
a
precious
hour
may
it
be
deducted
from
your
life
francis
you
hate
me
then
amelia
i
despise
you
away
francis
stamping
with
fury
only
wait
you
shall
learn
to
tremble
before
me
to
sacrifice
me
for
a
beggar
exit
in

amelia
go
thou
base
villain
now
charles
am
i
again
thine
own
beggar
did
he
say
then
is
the
world
turned
upside
down
beggars
are
kings
and
kings
are
beggars
i
would
not
change
the
rags
he
wears
for
the
imperial
purple
the
look
with
which
he
begs
must
indeed
be
a
noble
a
royal

a

withers

for

to
blow
out
a

almost
to
the
rank
of
a
regular
science

nature

by
the
force
of
experiments
to
define
her
limits
so
that

now
calculate
the

and

to

so
far

no

why
should
not
one
try
one
skill
in
this
line
a
woman
in
paris
by
means
of
a
regularly
performed
series
of
experiments
carried
the
art
of
poisoning
to
such
perfection
that
she
could
predict
almost
to
a

day
of
death
however
remote

should

by
a
woman

beckmann
in

and
how
then
must
i
too
go
to
work
to
dissever
that
sweet
and
peaceful
union
of
soul
and
body
what
species
of
sensations
should
i
seek
to
produce
which
would
most
fiercely
assail
the

of

anger
that

gnaws
far

what
and
are
these
the

executioners
of

the

so
soon
exhausted
in

how
now
what

i
have
it
starting
up

what
is

against
terror
what

have
religion

giant
icy
grasp

yet
if

come

thou
howling

that
desolatest
thine

show
him
in

the
joys
of

while
with
fleeting

you
elude

thus
will
i
work
my
battery
of

stroke
after

upon

furies
close
upon

the

this
francis

have
something
to
say
to
thee
hermann
hermann
i
am
all
attention
francis
i
know
thee
thou
art
a
resolute
fellow
a
man
of
to
call
thee
my
father
has
greatly
belied
thee
hermann
hermann
the
devil
take
me
if
i
forget
it
francis

like
a
man
vengeance
becomes
a
manly
heart
thou

my
mind
hermann
take
this
purse
hermann
it
should
be
heavier
were
i
master
here
hermann
that
is
my
unceasing
wish
most
gracious
sir
i
thank
you
francis
really
hermann
dost
thou
wish
that
i
were
master
but
my
father
has
the
marrow
of
a
lion
in
his
bones
and
i
am
but
a
younger
son
hermann
i
wish
you
were
the
eldest
son
and
that
your
father
were
as
marrowless
as
a
girl
sinking
in
a
consumption
francis
ha
how
that
elder
son
would
recompense
thee
how
he
would
raise
thee
from
this
grovelling
condition
so
ill
suited
to
thy
spirit
and
noble
birth
to
be
a
light
of
the
age
then
shouldst
thou
be
covered
with
gold
from
head
to
foot
and
dash
through
the
streets
four
in
hand
verily
thou
shouldst
but
i
am
losing
sight
of
what
i
meant
to
have
you
already
forgotten
the
lady
amelia
hermann
hermann
a
curse
upon
it
why
do
you
remind
me
of
her
francis
my
brother
has
filched
her
away
from
you
hermann
he
shall
rue
it
francis
she
gave
you
the
sack
and
if
i
remember
right
he
kicked
you
down
stairs
hermann
for
which
i
will
kick
him
into
hell
francis
he
used
to
say
it
was
whispered
abroad
that
your
father
could
never
look
upon
you
without
smiting
his
breast
and
sighing
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
hermann
wildly
thunder
and
lightning
no
more
of
this
francis
he
advised
you
to
sell
your
patent
of
nobility
by
auction
and
to
get
your
stockings
mended
with
the
proceeds
hermann
by
all
the
devils
in
hell
i
scratch
out
his
eyes
with
my
own
nails
francis
what
you
are
growing
angry
what
signifies
your
anger
what
harm
can
you
do
him
what
can
a
mouse
like
you
do
to
such
a
lion
your
rage
only
makes
his
triumph
the
sweeter
you
can
do
nothing
more
than
gnash
your
teeth
and
vent
your
rage
upon
a
dry
crust
hermann
stamping
i
will
grind
him
to
powder
francis
slapping
his
shoulder
fie
hermann
you
are
a
gentleman
you
must
not
put
up
with
the
affront
you
must
not
give
up
the
lady
no
not
for
all
the
world
hermann
by
my
soul
i
would
move
heaven
and
earth
were
i
in
your
place
hermann
i
will
not
rest
till
i
have
him
and
him
too
under
ground
francis
not
so
violent
hermann
come
nearer
you
shall
have
amelia
hermann
that
i
must
despite
the
devil
himself
i
will
have
her
francis
you
shall
have
her
i
tell
you
and
that
from
my
hand
come
closer
i
you
do
know
perhaps
that
charles
is
as
good
as
disinherited
hermann
going
closer
to
him
incredible
the
first
i
have
heard
of
it
francis
be
patient
and
listen
another
time
you
shall
hear
yes
i
tell
you
as
good
as
banished
these
eleven
months
but
the
old
man
already
begins
to
lament
the
hasty
step
which
however
i
flatter
myself
with
a
smile
is
not
entirely
his
own
amelia
too
is
incessantly
pursuing
him
with
her
tears
and
reproaches
presently
he
will
be
having
him
searched
for
in
every
quarter
of
the
world
and
if
he
finds
him
then
it
all
over
with
you
hermann
you
may
perhaps
have
the
honor
of
most
obsequiously
holding
the
while
he
alights
with
the
lady
to
get
married
hermann
i
strangle
him
at
the
altar
first
francis
his
father
will
soon
give
up
his
estates
to
him
and
live
in
retirement
in
his
castle
then
the
proud
roysterer
will
have
the
reins
in
his
own
hands
and
laugh
his
enemies
to
scorn
and
i
who
wished
to
make
a
great
man
of
you
a
man
of
consequence
i
myself
hermann
shall
have
to
make
my
humble
obeisance
at
his
threshold
hermann
with
fire
no
as
sure
as
my
name
is
hermann
that
shall
never
be
if
but
the
smallest
spark
of
wit
glimmer
in
this
brain
of
mine
that
shall
never
be
francis
will
you
be
able
to
prevent
it
you
too
my
good
hermann
will
be
made
to
feel
his
lash
he
will
spit
in
your
face
when
he
meets
you
in
the
streets
and
woe
be
to
you
should
you
venture
to
shrug
your
shoulders
or
to
make
a
wry
mouth
look
my
friend
this
is
all
that
your
lovesuit
your
prospects
and
your
mighty
plans
amount
to
hermann
tell
me
what
am
i
to
do
francis
well
then
listen
hermann
you
see
how
i
enter
into
your
feelings
like
a
true
friend
go
disguise
yourself
so
that
no
one
may
recognize
you
obtain
audience
of
the
old
man
pretend
to
come
straight
from
bohemia
to
have
been
at
the
battle
of
prague
along
with
my
brother
to
have
seen
him
breathe
his
last
on
the
field
of
battle
hermann
will
he
believe
me
francis
ho
ho
let
that
be
my
care
take
this
packet
there
you
will
find
your
commission
set
forth
at
large
and
documents
to
boot
which
shall
convince
the
most
incredulous
only
make
haste
to
get
away
unobserved
slip
through
the
back
gate
into
the
yard
and
then
scale
the
garden
the
denouement
of
this
tragicomedy
you
may
leave
to
me
hermann
that
i
suppose
will
be
long
live
our
new
baron
francis
von
moor
francis
patting
his
cheeks
how
cunning
you
are
by
this
means
you
see
we
attain
all
our
aims
at
once
and
quickly
amelia
relinquishes
all
hope
of
him
the
old
man
reproaches
himself
for
the
death
of
his
son
and
he
sickens
a
tottering
edifice
needs
no
earthquake
to
bring
it
down
he
will
not
survive
the
intelligence
then
am
i
his
only
son
amelia
loses
every
support
and
becomes
the
plaything
of
my
will
and
you
may
easily
guess
in
short
all
will
go
as
we
wish
but
you
must
not
flinch
from
your
word
hermann
what
do
you
say
exultingly
sooner
shall
the
ball
turn
back
in
its
course
and
bury
itself
in
the
entrails
of
the
marksman
depend
upon
me
only
let
me
to
the
work
adieu
francis
calling
after
him
the
harvest
is
thine
dear
hermann
alone
when
the
ox
has
drawn
the
corn
into
the
barn
he
must
put
up
with
hay
a
dairy
maid
for
thee
and
no

asleep
in
an
amelia
amelia
approaching
him
on
softly
softly

slumbers
she
places
herself
before
him
how
beautiful
how
venerable
venerable
as
the
picture
of
a
saint
no
i
can
not
be
angry
with
thee
thou
head
with
the
silver
locks
i
can
not
be
angry
with
thee
slumber
on
gently
wake
up
cheerfully
i
alone

be
the
sufferer
old
dreaming
my
son
my
son
my
son
amelia
seizes
his
hand

his
son
is
in
his
dreams

how
miserable

on
me

mournful
look

abruptly

old

but
a
dream

half
awake

his
hands
cruel
francis
wilt
thou
tear
him
even
from
my
dreams

mark
that
amelia
old
rousing
himself
where
is

where
where
am
i
you
here
amelia
amelia
how
do
you
find
yourself
you
have
had
a
refreshing
slumber
old
i
was
dreaming
about
my
son
why
did
i
not
dream
on
perhaps
i
might
have
obtained
forgiveness
from
his
lips
amelia
angels
bear
no
resentment
he
forgives
you
seizes
his
hand
sorrowfully
father
of
my
charles
i
too
forgive
you
old
no
no
my
child
that
paleness
of
thy
cheek
is
the
father
condemnation
poor
girl
i
have
robbed
thee
of
the
happiness
of
thy
youth
oh
do
not
curse
me
amelia
affectionately
kissing
his
hand
i
curse
you
old
dost
thou
know
this
portrait
my
daughter
amelia
charles
old
such
was
he
in
his
sixteenth
year
but
now
alas
how
changed
oh
it
is
raging
within
me
that
gentleness
is
now
indignation
that
smile
despair
it
was
his
birthday
was
it
not
amelia
in
the
jessamine
bower
when
you
drew
this
picture
of
him
oh
my
daughter
how
happy
was
i
in
your
loves
amelia
with
her
eye
still
riveted
upon
the
picture
no
no
it
is
not
he
by
heaven
that
is
not
charles
here
pointing
to
her
head
and
her
heart
here
he
is
perfect
and
how
different
the
feeble
pencil
avails
not
to
express
that
heavenly
spirit
which
reigned
in
his
fiery
eye
away
with
it
this
is
a
poor
image
an
ordinary
man
i
was
a
mere
dauber
old
that
kind
that
cheering
look
had
that
been
at
my
bedside
i
should
have
lived
in
the
midst
of
death
never
never
should
i
have
died
amelia
no
you
would
never
never
have
died
it
would
have
been
but
a
leap
as
we
leap
from
one
thought
to
another
and
a
better
that
look
would
have
lighted
you
across
the
tomb
that
look
would
have
lifted
you
beyond
the
stars
old
it
is
hard
it
is
sad
i
am
dying
and
my
son
charles
is
not
here
i
am
borne
to
my
tomb
and
he
weeps
not
over
my
grave
how
sweet
it
is
to
be
lulled
into
the
sleep
of
death
by
a
son
prayer
that
is
the
true
requiem
amelia
with
enthusiasm
yes
sweet
it
is
heavenly
sweet
to
be
lulled
into
the
sleep
of
death
by
the
song
of
the
beloved
perhaps
our
dreams
continue
in
the
grave
a
long
eternal
dream
of
charles
till
the
trumpet
of
resurrection
sounds
rising
in
ecstasy
and
thenceforth
and
forever
in
his
arms
a
pause
she
goes
to
the
piano
and
plays
andromache
oh
hector
wilt
thou
go
for
evermore
when
fierce
achilles
on
the
shore
heaps
countless
victims
patroclus
grave
when
then
thy
hapless
orphan
boy
will
rear
teach
him
to
praise
the
gods
and
hurl
the
spear
when
thou
art
swallow
up
in
xanthus
wave
old
a
beautiful
song
my
daughter
you
must
play
that
to
me
before
i
die
amelia
it
is
the
parting
of
hector
and
andromache
charles
and
i
used
often
to
sing
it
together
to
the
guitar
she
continues

one
thing

some
unfortunate

gloomy
shade

bareheaded
begging
his
bread
from
door
to
door
after
five
months
the
fatal
war
between
prussia
and

out
afresh

wings
of
victory
we
chanced
to
lie
together
in
the
same
tent
he
talked
much
of
his
old
father
and
of
happy
days
that
were
past
and
of
disappointed
hopes
it
brought
the
tears
into
our

that
day

regiments
were
successively
cut
down
by
his
side
and
still
he
kept
his
ground
fiery
shells

right
and

and
still
your
son
kept
his
ground
a
ball
shattered
his
right
hand

seized
the
colors
with
his
left
and
still
he
kept
his
ground

on
the
evening
of

him
on

spot

had
sunk
down
amidst
a
shower
of
hissing
balls
with
his
left
hand
he
was
staunching
the
blood
that
flowed
from

fearful
wound

right

had
buried
in
the
earth

he
when

a
report
through
the
ranks
that
the
general
fell
an
hour
ago
he
is
fallen
i
replied
and

then
he
cried
withdrawing
his
left
hand
from
the
wound

every
brave
soldier
follow
his
general
soon
after
he
breathed
out
his
noble
soul

my
mode

welcome
to
the
bohemian
forests
why
you
are
grown
quite
stout
and
jolly
you
have
brought
us
recruits
in
right
earnest
a
little
army
of
them
you
are
the
very
prince
of
crimps
spiegel
eh
brother
eli
and
proper
fellows
they
are
you
must
confess
the
blessing
of
heaven
is
visibly
upon
me
i
was
a
poor
hungry
wretch
and
had
nothing
but
this
staff
when
i
went
over
the
jordan
and
now
there
are
of
us
mostly
ruined
shopkeepers
rejected
masters
of
arts
and
from
the
swabian
provinces
they
are
a
rare
set
of
fellows
brother
capital
fellows
i
promise
you
they
will
steal
you
the
very
buttons
off
each
other
trousers
in
perfect
security
although
in
the
teeth
of
a
loaded
musket
and
they
live
in
clover
and
enjoy
a
reputation
for
forty
miles
round
which
is
quite
astonishing
the

hang
your

up
in

and
take
you
a
wager
it
gone
the
next
minute
as
clean
out
of

as
if
the
devil
himself
had
walked
off
with
it
there
is
not
a
newspaper
in
which
you
will
not
find
some
little
feat
or
other
of
that
cunning
fellow
spiegelberg
i
take
in
the
papers
for
nothing
else
they
have
described
me
from
head
to
foot
you
would
think
you
saw
me
they
have
not
forgotten
even
my
but
we
lead
them
gloriously
by
the
nose
the
other
day
i
went
to
the
and
pretended
that
i
had
seen
the
famous
spiegelberg
dictated
to
a
who
was
sitting
there
the
exact
image
of
a
quack
doctor
in
the
town
the
matter
gets
wind
the
fellow
is
arrested
put
to
the
rack
and
in
his
anguish
and
stupidity
he
confesses
the
devil
take
me
if
he
does
not
confesses
that
he
is
spiegelberg
fire
and
fury
i
was
on
the
point
of
giving
myself
up
to
a
magistrate
rather
than
have
my
fair
fame
marred
by
such
a
poltroon
however
within
three
months
he
was
hanged
i
was
obliged
to
stuff
a
right
good
pinch
of
snuff
into
my
nose
as
some
time
afterwards
i
was
passing
the
gibbet
and
saw
the
parading
there
in
all
his
glory
and
while
spiegelberg
representative
is
dangling
by
the
neck
the
real
spiegelberg
very
quietly
slips
himself
out
of
the
noose
and
makes
jolly
long
noses
behind
the
backs
of
these
sagacious
wiseacres
of
the
law
raz
laughing
you
are
still
the
same
fellow
you
always
were
spiegel
ay
sure
body
and
soul
but
i
must
tell
you
a
bit
of
fun
my
boy
which
i
had
the
other
day
in
the
nunnery
of
austin
we
fell
in
with
the
convent
just
about
sunset
and
as
i
had
not
fired
a
single
cartridge
all
day
you
know
i
hate
the
as
i
hate
death
itself
i
was
determined
to
immortalize
the
night
by
some
glorious
exploit
even
though
it
should
cost
the
devil
one
of
his
ears
we
kept
quite
quiet
till
late
in
the
night
at
last
all
is
as
still
as
a
mouse
the
lights
are
extinguished
we
fancy
the
nuns
must
be
comfortably
tucked
up
so
i
take
brother
grimm
along
with
me
and
order
the
others
to
wait
at
the
gate
till
they
hear
my
whistle
i
secure
the
watchman
take
the
keys
from
him
creep
into
the
dormitory
take
away
all
their
clothes
and
whisk
the
bundle
out
at
the
window
we
go
on
from
cell
to
cell
take
away
the
clothes
of
one
sister
after
another
and
lastly
those
of
the
herself
then
i
sound
my
whistle
and
my
fellows
outside
begin
to
storm
and
halloo
as
if
doomsday
was

going

tell
me
about
your
stratagems
spiegel
ah
yes
my
stratagems
well
when
you
get
into
a
town
the
first
thing
is
to
fish
out
from
the
beadles
watchmen
and
turnkeys
who
are
their
best
customers
and
for
these
accordingly
you
must
look
out
then
ensconce
yourself
snugly
in
brothels
and
and
observe
who
cry
out
most
against
the
cheapness
of
the
times
the
reduced
five
per
and
the
increasing
nuisance
of
police
regulations
who
rail
the
loudest
against
government
or
decry
physiognomical
science
and
such
like
these
are
the
right
sort
of
fellows
brother
their
honesty
is
as
loose
as
a
hollow
tooth
you
have
only
to
apply
your
pincers
or
a
shorter
and
even
better
plan
is
to
drop
a
full
purse
in
the
public
highway
conceal
yourself
somewhere
near
and
mark
who
finds
it
presently
after
you
come
running
up
search
proclaim
your
loss
aloud
and
ask
him
as
it
were
casually
have
you
perchance
picked
up
a
purse
sir
if
he
says
yes
why
then
the
devil
fails
you
but
if
he
denies
it
with
a
pardon
me
sir
i
remember
i
am
sorry

he
jumps
up

you
are

my
god
as
if
that
had
ever
been
doubted

you
have
got
your
man

you
must
take
great
care
to
land
him
cleverly
you
see
my
son
the
way
i
have
managed
is
thus
as
soon
as
i
was
on
the
scent
i
stuck
to
my
candidate
like
a
leech
i
drank
brotherhood
with
him
and
you
must
always
pay
the
score
that
costs
a
pretty
penny
it
is
true
but
never
mind
that
you
must
go
further
introduce
him
to

brothels
entangle
him
in
broils
and
rogueries
till
he
becomes
bankrupt
in
health

strength

the
way

you
ruin
both
body

me
brother

i
have
experienced
it
more
than
fifty
times

my
extensive
practice

when
the
honest
man
is
once
ousted
from
his
stronghold
the
devil
has
it
all
his
own

transition
is
then
as
easy

from
a
whore

a
devotee

hark
what
bang
was
that
raz
it
was
thunder
go
on

there
is
a
yet
shorter
and
still
better
way
you
strip
your

all
he
has

to
his
very

then
he
will
come
to
you
of
his
own

wo
teach
me

ask
that
fellow
there
my

how
neatly
i
got
him
into

showed
him
forty
ducats

i
promised
to
give
him

he
would
bring
me
an

pass
through

had
gained
the
day
in
a
suit
worth
a
million

the
craftiness

the

was
just
sitting
down
to
a
game

backgammon
how
many
of

are
there
said
he
to
me
rising
in

i
saw
him
bite
his
nether
lip
which
he
never
does
except
when
he
is
very
determined
not
more
than
five
i
replied
that
enough
he
said
threw
his
score
on
the
table
left
the
wine
he
had
ordered
untouched
and
off
we
went
the
whole
time
he
did
not
utter
a
syllable
but
walked
aloof
and
alone
only
asking
us
from
time
to
time
whether
we
heard
anything
and
now
and
then
desiring
us
to
lay
our
ears

the
count
came
in

his
carriage
heavily
laden

lawyer
seated
by
his

in

two
horsemen
riding
behind

you
should
have
seen
the

with

he
ran
before
us
to
the
carriage
and
the
voice
with
which
he
thundered

the
coachman

would
not
halt
was

toppled

who
conveyed
the
notice
to
him
in
a
little
billet
which
he
slipped
into
his
porridge
roller
i
had
but
small
hope
of
success
schweitzer
we
waited
till
the
thoroughfares
were
clear
the
whole
town
was
out
after
the
sight
equestrians
pedestrians
carriages
all
the
noise
and
the
sounded
far
and
wide
now
says
the
captain
light
up
light
up
we
all
flew
like
darts
they
set
fire
to
the
city
in
places
at
once
threw
burning
firebrands
on
the
and
into
the
churches
and
granaries
morbleu
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
northeaster
which
like
us
must
have
owed
a
grudge
to
the
city
came
seasonably
to
our
aid
and
helped
to
lift
the
flames
up
to
the
highest
gables
meanwhile
we
ran
up
and
down
the
streets
like
furies
crying
fire
ho
fire
ho
in
every
direction
there
was
such
howling
tolling
and
presently
the
blew
up
into
the
air
with
a
crash
as
if
the
earth
were
rent
in
twain
heaven
burst
to
shivers
and
hell
sunk
ten
thousand
fathoms
deeper
roller
now
my
guards
looked
behind
them
there
lay
the
city
like
sodom
and
gomorrah
the
whole
horizon
was
one
mass
of
fire
brimstone
and
smoke
and
forty
hills
echoed
and
reflected
the
infernal
prank
far
and
wide
a
panic
seized
them
all
i
take
advantage
of
the
moment
and
quick
as
lightning
my
fetters
had
been
taken
off
so
nearly
was
my
time
come
while
my
guards
were
looking
away
petrified
like
lot
wife
i
shot
off
tore
through
the
crowd
and
away
after
running
some
sixty
paces
i
throw
off
my
clothes
plunge
into
the
river
and
swim
along
under
water
till
i
think
they
have
lost
sight
of
me
my
captain
stood
ready
with
horses
and
clothes
and
here
i
am
moor
moor
i
only
wish
that
you
may
soon
get
into
just
such
another
scrape
that
i
may
requite
you
in
like
manner
raz
a
brutal
wish
for
which
you
deserve
to
be
hanged
it
was
a
glorious
prank
though
roller
it
was
help
in
need
you
can
not
judge
of
it
you
should
have
marched
like
me
with
a
rope
round
your
neck
travelling
to
your
grave
in
the
living
body
and
seen
their
horrid
sacramental
forms
and
hangman
ceremonies
and
then
at
every
reluctant
step
as
the
struggling
feet
were
thrust
forward
to
see
the
infernal
machine
on
which
i
was
to
be
elevated
glaring
more
and
more
hideously
in
the
blaze
of
a
noonday
sun
and
the
hangman
rapscallions
watching
for
their
prey
and
the
horrible
the
cursed
twang
still
rings
in
my
ears
and
the
screeching
hungry
ravens
a
whole
flight
of
them
who
were
hovering
over
the
carcass
of
my
predecessor
to
see
all
this
ay
more
to
have
a
foretaste
of
the
blessedness
which
was
in
store
for
me
brother
brother
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
signal
of
deliverance
it
was
an
explosion
as
if
the
vault
of
heaven
were
rent
in
twain
hark
ye
fellows
i
tell
you
if
a
man
were
to
leap
out
of
a
fiery
furnace
into
a
freezing
lake
he
could
not
feel
the
contrast
half
so
strongly
as
i
did
when
i
gained
the
opposite
shore
spiegel
laughs
poor
wretch
well
you
have
got
over
it
pledges
him
here
to
a
happy
regeneration
roller

away
his
glass
no
by
all
the
treasures
of
mammon
i
should
not
like
to
go
through
it
a
second
time
death
is
something
more
than
a
harlequin
leap
and
its
terrors
are
even
worse
than
death
itself
spiegel
and
the
leaping
into
the
air
do
you
see
it
now
razman
that
was
the
reason
the
air
stunk
so
for
miles
round
of
brimstone
as
if
the
whole
wardrobe
of
moloch
was
being
aired
under
the
open
firmament
it
was
a
captain
i
envy
you
for
it
schweitzer
if
the
town
makes
it
a
to
see
our
comrade
killed
by
a
baited
hog
why
the
devil
should
we
scruple
to
sacrifice
the
city
for
the
rescue
of
our
comrade
and
by
the
way
our
fellows
had
the
extra
treat
of
being
able
to
plunder
worse
than
the
old
emperor
tell
me
what
have
you
sacked
one
of
the
troop
i
crept
into
stephen
church
during
the
hubbub
and
tore
the
gold
lace
from
the
altarcloth
the
patron
saint
thought
i
to
myself
can
make
gold
lace
out
of
packthread
schweitzer
was
well
done
what
is
the
use
of
such
rubbish
in
a
church
they
offer
it
to
the
creator
who
despises
such
trumpery
while
they
leave
his
creatures
to
die
of
hunger
and
you
sprazeler
where
did
you
throw
your
net
a
second
i
and
brizal
broke
into
a
merchant

brought

have
filched
two
gold
watches
and
a
dozen
silver
spoons
schweitzer
well
done
well
done

we
have
lighted
them
a
bonfire
that
will
take
a
fortnight
to
put
out
again
and
to
get
rid
of
the

they
must
ruin

shrivelled
old

from

his

horrible
wickedness

ripe
for
retribution

headlong

last
trump
charles
masterly
guesses
thus
far
but
now
sir
to
the
point
what
is
it
that
the
right
worshipful
justices

to
me
through
you

what
you
are
not

as
far
as
your
eye
can
reach
you
are
environed
by

there
is
no
chance
of
escape

surely
as
cherries
grow

so
surely
shall
you
turn
your
backs
upon
these
oaks

forbearance
justice

such
miscreants
if
you
instantly
prostrate
yourselves
in
submission
and
sue
for
mercy
and
forgiveness
then
severity
itself
will
relent
to
compassion
and
justice
be
to
thee
an
indulgent
mother
she
will
shut
one
eye
upon
your
horrible
crimes
and
be
satisfied
only

men
of
whom
i
am
the
captain
and
not
one
of
them
has
been
taught
to
trot
at
a
signal
or
learned
to
dance
to
the
music
of
artillery
while
yonder
stand
seventeen
hundred
men
grown
gray
under
the
musket
but
now
listen
thus
says
moor
the
captain
of
incendiaries
it
is
true
i
have
slain
a
count
of
the
empire
burnt
and
plundered
the
church
of
dominic
flung
firebrands
into
your
bigoted
city
and
brought
down
the
upon
the
heads
of
devout
christians
but
that
is
not
all
i
have
done
more
he
holds
out
his
right
hand
do
you
observe
these
four
costly
rings
one
on
each
finger
go
and
report
punctually
to
their
worships
on
whose
sentence
hangs
life
or
death
what
you
shall
hear
and
see
this
ruby
i
drew
from
the
finger
of
a
minister
whom
i
stretched
at
the
feet
of
his
prince
during
the
chase
he
had
fawned
himself
up
from
the
lowest
dregs
to
be
the
first
favorite
the
ruin
of
his
neighbor
was
his
ladder
to
greatness
orphans
tears
helped
him
to
mount
it
this
diamond
i
took
from
a
lord
treasurer
who
sold
offices
of
honor
and
trust
to
the
highest
bidder
and
drove
the
sorrowing
patriot
from
his
door
this
opal
i
wear
in
honor
of
a
priest
of
your
cloth
whom
i
dispatched
with
my
own
hand
after
he
had
publicly
deplored
in
his
pulpit
the
waning
power
of
the
inquisition
i
could
tell
you
more
stories
about
my
rings
but
that
i
repent
the
words
i
have
already
wasted
upon
you
father
dom
o
pharaoh
pharaoh
charles
do
you
hear
it
did
you
mark
that
sigh
does
he
not
stand
there
as
if
he
were
imploring
fire
from
heaven
to
descend
and
destroy
this
troop
of
korah
he
pronounces
judgment
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
eternal
damnation
with
a
christian
alas
is
it
possible
for
humanity
to
be
so
utterly
blind
he
who
has
the
hundred
eyes
of
argus
to
spy
out
the
faults
of
his
brother
can
he
be
so
totally
blind
to
his
own
they
thunder
forth
from
their
clouds
about
gentleness
and
forbearance
while
they
sacrifice
human
victims
to
the
god
of
love
as
if
he
were
the
fiery
moloch
they
preach
the
love
of
one
neighbor
while
they
drive
the
aged
and
blind
with
curses
from
their
door
they
rave
against
covetousness
yet
for
the
sake
of
gold
they
have
depopulated
peru
and
yoked
the
natives
like
cattle
to
their
chariots
they
rack
their
brains
in
wonder
to
account
for
the
creation
of
a
judas
iscariot
yet
the
best
of
them
would
betray
the
whole
trinity
for
ten
shekels
out
upon
you
pharisees
ye
falsifiers
of
truth
ye
apes
of
deity
you
are
not
ashamed
to
kneel
before
crucifixes
and
altars
you
lacerate
your
backs
with
thongs
and
mortify
your
flesh
with
fasting
and
with
these
pitiful
mummeries
you
think
fools
as
you
are
to
veil
the
eyes
of
him
whom
with
the
same
breath
you
address
as
the
omniscient
just
as
the
great
are
the
most
bitterly
mocked
by
those
who
flatter
them
while
they
pretend
to
hate
flatterers
you
boast
of
your
honesty
and
your
exemplary
conduct
but
the
god
who
sees
through
your
hearts
would
be
wroth
with
him
that
made
you
were
he
not
the
same
that
had
also
created
the
monsters
of
the
nile
away
with
him
out
of
my
sight
father
dom
that
such
a
miscreant
should
be
so
proud
charles
that
not
all
now
i
will
speak
proudly
go
and
tell
the
right
worshipful
justices
who
set
men
lives
upon
the
cast
of
a
die
i
am
not
one
of
those
thieves
who
conspire
with
sleep
and
midnight
and
play
the
hero
and
the
lordling
on
a
what
i
have
done
i
shall
no
doubt
hereafter
be
doomed
to
read
in
the
register
of
heaven
but
with
his
miserable
ministers
of
earth
i
will
waste
no
more
words
tell
your
masters
that
my
trade
is
retribution
vengeance
my
occupation
he
turns
his
back
upon
him
father
dom
then
you
despise
mercy
and
forbearance
it
so
i
have
done
with
you
turning
to
the
troop
now
then
sirs
you
shall
hear
what
the
high
powers
direct
me
to
make
known
to
you
if
you
will
instantly
deliver
up
to
me
this
condemned
malefactor
bound
hand
and
foot
you
shall
receive
a
full
pardon
your
enormities
shall
be
entirely
blotted
out
even
from
memory
the
holy
church
will
receive
you
like
lost
sheep
with
renewed
love
into
her
maternal
bosom
and
the
road
to
honorable
employment
shall
be
open
to
you
all
with
a
triumphant
smile
now
sir
how
does
your
majesty
relish
this
come
on
bind
him
and
you
are
free
charles
do
you
hear
that
do
you
hear
it
what
startles
you
why
do
you
hesitate
they
offer
you
freedom
you
that
are
already
their
prisoners
they
grant
you
your
lives
and
that
is
no
idle
pretence
for
it
is
clear
you
are
already
condemned
felons
they
promise
you
honor
and
emolument
and
on
the
other
hand
what
can
you
hope
for
even
should
you
be
victorious
but
disgrace
and
curses
and
persecution
they
ensure
you
the
pardon
of
heaven
you
that
are
actually
damned
there
is
not
a
single
hair
on
any
of
you
that
is
not
already
bespoke
in
hell
do
you
still
hesitate
are
you
staggered
is
it
so
difficult
then
to
choose
between
heaven
and
hell
do
put
in
a
word
father
father
dom
aside
is
the
fellow
crazy
aloud
perhaps
you
are
afraid
that
this
is
a
trap
to
catch
you
alive
read
it
yourselves
here
is
the
general
pardon
fully
signed
he
hands
a
paper
to
schweitzer
can
you
still
doubt
charles
only
see
only
see
what
more
can
you
require
signed
with
their
own
hands
it
is
mercy
beyond
all
bounds
or
are
you
afraid
of
their
breaking
their
word
because
you
have
heard
it
said
that
no
faith
need
be
kept
with
traitors
dismiss
that
fear
policy
alone
would
constrain
them
to
keep
their
word
even
though
it
should
merely
have
been
pledged
to
old
nick
who
hereafter
would
believe
them
how
could
they
trade
with
it
a
second
time
i
would
take
my
oath
upon
it
that
they
mean
it
sincerely
they
know
that
i
am
the
man
who
has
goaded
you
on
and
incited
you
they
believe
you
innocent
they
look
upon
your
crimes
as
so
many
juvenile
errors
exuberances
of
rashness
it
is
i
alone
they
want
i
must
pay
the
penalty
is
it
not
so
father
father
dom
what
devil
incarnate
is
it
that
speaks
out
of
him
of
course
it
is
so
of
course
the
fellow
turns
my
brain
charles
what
no
answer
yet
do
you
think
it
possible
to
cut
your
way
through
yon
phalanx
only
look
round
you
just
look
round
you
surely
do
not
reckon
upon
that
that
were
indeed
a
childish
conceit
or
do
you
flatter
yourselves
that
you
will
fall
like
heroes
because
you
saw
that
i
rejoiced
in
the
prospect
of
the
fight
oh
do
not
console
yourself
with
the
thought
you
are
not
moor
you
are
miserable
thieves
wretched
tools
of
my
great
designs
despicable
as
the
rope
in
the
hand
of
the
hangman
no
no
thieves
do
not
fall
like
heroes
life
must
be
the
hope
of
thieves
for
something
fearful
has
to
follow
thieves
may
well
be
allowed
to
quake
at
the
fear
of
death
hark
do
you
hear
their
horns
echoing
through
the
forest
see
there
how
their
glittering
sabres
threaten
what
are
you
still
irresolute
are
you
mad
are
you
insane
it
is
unpardonable
do
you
imagine
i
shall
thank
you
for
my
life
i
disdain
your
sacrifice
father
dom
in
utter
amazement
i
shall
go
mad
i
must
be
gone
was
the
like
ever
heard
of
charles
or
are
you
afraid
that
i
shall
stab
myself
and
so
by
suicide
put
an
end
to
the
bargain
which
only
holds
good
if
i
am
given
up
alive
no
comrades
that
is
a
vain
fear
here
i
fling
away
my
dagger
and
my
pistols
and
this
phial
of
poison
which
might
have
been
a
treasure
to
me
i
am
so
wretched
that
i
have
lost
the
power
even
over
my
own
life
what
still
in
suspense
or
do
you
think
perhaps
that
i
shall
stand
on
my
defence
when
you
try
to
seize
me
see
here
i
bind
my
right
hand
to
this
now
i
am
quite
defenceless

amelia
in

the

bright
as
an

from

more
beautiful
than
aught
of

was
he
his
look
as
sunbeams
when
they
fall
reflected
from
a
calm
cerulean
sea
his
warm
embrace
oh
ravishing
delight
with
heart
to
heart
the
fiery
pulses
danced
our
every
sense
wrap
in
ecstatic
night
our
souls
in
blissful

oh
what
paradise
of
feeling
as
two
flames
which
round
each
other
twine
or
flood
of
seraph
gently
stealing
in

soft
swell

commingled
melted

cold
earth

and
love
without

he
gone
forever
gone
alas
in

my
bleeding
heart
in
bitter
anguish
sighs
to

alone
this
world
of

mortal
life
in
hopeless
sorrow

enter
francis
francis
here
again
already
perverse
enthusiast
you
stole
away
from
the
festive
banquet
and
marred
the
mirthful
pleasures
of
my
guests
amelia
is
pity
truly
to
mar
such
innocent
pleasures
shame
on
them
the
funeral
knell
that
tolled
over
your
father
grave
must
still
be
ringing
in
your
ears
francis
wilt
thou
sorrow
then
forever
let
the
dead
sleep
in
peace
and
do
thou
make
the
living
happy
i
come
amelia
and
when
do
you
go
again
francis
alas
look
not
on
me
thus
sorrowfully
you
wound
me
amelia
i
come
to
tell
you
amelia
to
tell
me
i
suppose
that
francis
von
moor
has
become
lord
and
master
here
francis
precisely
so
that
is
the
very
subject
on
which
i
wish
to
communicate
with
you
maximilian
von
moor
is
gone
to
the
tomb
of
his
ancestors
i
am
master
but
i
wish
to
be
so
in
the
fullest
sense
amelia
you
know
what
you
have
been
to
our
house
always
regarded
as
moor
daughter
his
love
for
you
will
survive
even
death
itself
that
assuredly
you
will
never
forget
amelia
never
never
who
could
be
so
unfeeling
as
to
drown
the
memory
of
it
in
festive
banqueting
francis
it
is
your
duty
to
repay
the
love
of
the
father
to
his
sons
and
charles
is
dead
ha
you
are
struck
with
amazement
dizzy
with
the
thought
to
be
sure
is
a
flattering
and
an
elating
prospect
which
may
well
overpower
the
pride
of
a
woman
francis
tramples
under
foot
the
hopes
of
the
noblest
and
the
richest
and
offers
his
heart
his
hand
and
with
them
all
his
gold
his
castles
and
his
forests
to
a
poor
and
but
for
him
destitute
orphan
francis
the
feared
voluntarily
declares
himself
amelia
slave
amelia
why
does
not
a
thunderbolt
cleave
the
impious
tongue
which
utters
the
criminal
proposal
thou
hast
murdered
my
beloved
charles
and
shall
amelia
his
betrothed
call
thee
husband
thou
francis
be
not
so
violent
most
gracious
princess
it
is
true
that
francis
does
not
come
before
you
like
a
whining
celadon
is
true
he
has
not
learned
like
a
lovesick
swain
of
arcadia
to
sigh
forth
his
amorous
plaints
to
the
echo
of
caves
and
rocks
francis
speaks
and
when
not
answered
commands
amelia
commands
thou
reptile
command
me
and
what
if
i
laughed
your
command
to
scorn
francis
that
you
will
hardly
do
there
are
means
too
which
i
know
of
admirably
adapted
to
humble
the
pride
of
a
capricious
stubborn
girl
cloisters
and
walls
amelia
excellent
delightful
to
be
forever
secure
within
cloisters
and
walls
from
thy
basilisk
look
and
to
have
abundant
leisure
to
think
and
dream
of
charles
welcome
with
your
cloister
welcome
your
walls

is
that

have
taught
me
the
art
of
tormenting
you

sight
of
me

like
a
fury
drive
out
of
your
head
these
eternal
phantasies
of
charles
francis
shall
be
the
dread
phantom
ever
lurking
behind
the
image
of
your
beloved
like
the
that
guards
the
subterranean
treasure
i
will
drag
you
to
church
by
the
hair
and
sword
in
hand
wring
the
nuptial
vow
from
your
soul
by
main
force
will
i
ascend
your
virginal
couch
and
storm
your
haughty
modesty
with
still
greater
haughtiness
amelia
gives
him
a
slap
in
the
face
then
take
that
first
by
way
of
dowry
francis
ha
i
will
be
tenfold
and
twice
tenfold
revenged
for
this
my
wife
no
that
honor
you
shall
never
enjoy
you
shall
be
my
mistress
my
strumpet
the
honest
peasant
wife
shall
point
her
finger
at
you
as
she
passes
you
in
the
street
ay
gnash
your
teeth
as
fiercely
as
you
please
scatter
fire
and
destruction
from
your
eyes
the
fury
of
a
woman
piques
my
fancy
it
makes
you
more
beautiful
more
tempting
come
this
resistance
will
garnish
my
triumph
and
your
struggles
give
zest
to
my
embraces
come
come
to
my
chamber
i
burn
with
desire
come
this
instant
attempts
to
drag
her
away
amelia
falls
on
his
neck
forgive
me
francis
as
he
is
about
to
clasp
her
in
his
arms
she
suddenly
draws
the
sword
at
his
side
and
hastily
disengages
herself
do
you
see
now
miscreant
how
i
am
able
to
deal
with
you
i
am
only
a
woman
but
a
woman
enraged
dare
to
approach
and
this
steel
shall
strike
your
lascivious
heart
to
the
core
the
spirit
of
my
uncle
will
guide
my
hand
avaunt
this
instant
she
drives
him
away
ah
how
different
i
feel
now
i
breathe
again
i
feel
strong
as
the
snorting
steed
ferocious
as
the
tigress
when
she
springs
upon
the
ruthless
destroyer
of
her
cubs
to
a
cloister
did
he
say
i
thank
thee
for
the
happy
thought
now
has
disappointed
love
found
a
place
of
refuge
the
cloister
the
redeemer
bosom
is
the
sanctuary
of
disappointed
love
she
is
on
the
point
going
in
the
acting
edition
the
following
scene
occurs
between
herman
and
francis
immediately
before
that
with
amelia
as
schiller
himself
thought
this
among
the
happiest
of
his
additions
and
regretted
that
it
was
entirely
and
very
unfortunately
overlooked
in
the
first
edition
it
seems
desirable
to
introduce
it
here
as
well
as
the
soliloquy
immediately
following
which
has
acquired
some
celebrity
scene

you
please
for
any
business
we
may
have
to
arrange
there
is
room
enough
between
these
four
walls
at
all
events
i
just
say
a
few
words
to
you
by
way
of
preface
which
may
save
your
lungs
some
unnecessary
exertion
francis
reservedly
hum
and
what
may
those
words
be
hermann
with
bitter
irony
you
shall
have
amelia
and
that
from
my
hand
francis
with
astonishment
hermann
hermann
as
before
with
his
back
turned
on
francis
amelia
will
become
the
plaything
of
my
will
and
you
may
easily
guess
the
short
all
will
go
as
we
wish
breaks
into
an
indignant
laugh
and
then
turns
haughtily
to
francis
now
count
von
moor
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
francis
evasively
to
thee
nothing
i
had
something
to
say
to
hermann
no
evasion
why
was
i
sent
for
hither
was
it
to
be
your
dupe
a
second
time
and
to
hold
the
ladder
for
a
thief
to
mount
to
sell
my
soul
for
a
hangman
s
fee
what
else
did
you
want
with
me
francis
as
if
recollecting
ha
it
just
occurs
to
me
we
must
not
forget
the
main
point
did
not
my
steward
mention
it
to
you
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
the
dowry
hermann
this
is
mere
mockery
sir
or
if
not
mockery
something
worse
moor
take
care
of
how
you
kindle
my
fury
moor
we
are
alone
and
i
have
still
an
unsullied
name
to
stake
against
yours
trust
not
the
devil
although
he
be
of
your
own
raising
francis
with
dignity
does
this
deportment
become
thee
towards
thy
sovereign
and
gracious
master
tremble
slave
hermann
ironically
for
fear
of
your
displeasure
i
suppose
what
signifies
your
displeasure
to
a
man
who
is
at
war
with
himself
fie
moor
i
already
abhor
you
as
a
villain
let
me
not
despise
you
for
a
fool
i
can
open
graves
and
restore
the
dead
to
life
which
of
us
now
is
the
slave
francis
in
a
conciliating
tone
come
my
good
friend
be
discreet
and
do
not
prove
faithless
hermann
pshaw
to
expose
a
wretch
like
you
is
here
the
best
discretion
to
keep
faith
with
you
would
be
an
utter
want
of
sense
faith
with
whom
faith
with
the
prince
of
liars
oh
i
shudder
at
the
thought
of
such
faith
a
very
little
timely
faithlessness
would
have
almost
made
a
saint
of
me
but
patience
patience
revenge
is
cunning
in
resources
francis
ah
i
just
remember
you
lately
lost
a
purse
with
a
hundred
louis
in
it
in
this
apartment
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
here
my
good
friend
take
back
what
belongs
to
you
offers
him
a
purse
hermann
throws
it
scornfully
at
his
feet
a
curse
on
your
judas
bribe
it
is
the
of
hell
you
once
before
thought
to
make
my
poverty
a
pander
to
my
conscience
but
you
were
mistaken
count
egregiously
mistaken
that
purse
of
gold
came
most
opportunely
to
maintain
certain
persons
francis
terrified
hermann
hermann
let
me
not
suspect
certain
things
of
you
should
you
have
done
anything
contrary
to
my
instructions
you
would
be
the
vilest
of
traitors
hermann
exultingly
should
i
should
i
really
well
then
count
let
me
give
you
a
little
piece
of
information
significantly
i
will
fatten
up
your
infamy
and
add
fuel
to
your
doom
the
book
of
your
misdeeds
shall
one
day
be
served
up
as
a
banquet
and
all
the
world
be
invited
to
partake
of
it
contemptuously
do
you
understand
me
now
my
most
sovereign
gracious
and
excellent
master
francis
starts
up
losing
all
command
of
himself
ha
devil
deceitful
impostor
striking
his
forehead
to
think
that
i
should
stake
my
fortune
on
the
caprice
of
an
idiot
that
was
madness
throws
himself
in
great
excitement
on
a
couch
hermann
whistles
through
his
fingers
wheugh
the
biter
bit
francis
biting
his
lip
but
it
is
true
and
ever
will
be
true
that
there
is
no
thread
so
feebly
spun
or
which
snaps
asunder
so
readily
as
that
which
weaves
the
bands
of
guilt
hermann
gently
gently
are
angels
then
superseded
that
devils
turn
moralists
francis
starts
up
abruptly
to
hermann
with
a
malignant
laugh
and
certain
persons
will
no
doubt
acquire
much
honor
by
making
the
discovery
hermann
clapping
his
hands
masterly
inimitable
you
play
your
part
to
admiration
first
you
lure
the
credulous
fool
into
the
slough
and
then
chuckle
at
the
success
of
your
malice
and
cry
woe
be
to
you
sinner
laughing
and
clenching
his
teeth
oh
how
cleverly
these
imps
off
the
devil
manoeuvre
but
count
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
you
have
not
yet
got
your
lesson
quite
perfect
by
heavens
you
first
learn
what
the
losing
gamester
will
hazard
set
fire
to
the
says
the
pirate
and
blow
all
to
hell
both
friend
and
foe
francis
runs
to
the
wall
and
takes
down
a
pistol
here
is
treason
i
must
be
resolute
hermann
draws
a
pistol
as
quickly
from
his
pocket
and
presents
it
at
him
do
trouble
yourself
one
must
be
prepared
for
everything
with
you
francis
lets
the
pistol
fall
and
throws
himself
on
the
sofa
in
great
confusion
only
keep
my
council
till
till
i
have
collected
my
thoughts
hermann
i
suppose
till
you
have
hired
a
dozen
assassins
to
silence
my
tongue
forever
is
it
not
so
but
in
his
ear
the
secret
is
committed
to

the
pillars

tottering
to
their
fall
the
fences

broken
down

the
raging
enemy

already
bursting
in

calls
for
some
bold
and
sudden
resolve
what
if
i
went
in

and
secretly
plunged
this
sword
in
his
body
a
wounded

country
near

the

encamped
on
a

under

their
horses
are
grazing
below
charles
here
must
i
lie
throwing
himself
upon
the
ground
i
feel
as
if
my
limbs
were
all
shattered
my
tongue
is
as
dry
as
a
potsherd
schweitzer
disappears
unperceived
i
would
ask
one
of
you
to
bring
me
a
handful
of
water
from

you
are
all
tired
to
death

how
beautiful
the
harvest
looks
the
trees
are
breaking
with
the
weight
of
their
fruit
the
vines
are
full
of
promise
grimm
it
is
a
fruitful
year
charles
do
you
think
so
then
at
least
one
toil
in
the
world
will
be
repaid
one
yet
in
the
night
a
hailstorm
may
come
and
destroy
it
all
schwarz
that
is
very
possible
it
all
may
be
destroyed
an
hour
before
the
reaping
charles
just
what
i
say
all
will
be
destroyed
why
should
man
prosper
in
that
which
he
has
in
common
with
the
ant
while
he
fails
in
that
which
places
him
on
a
level
with
the
gods
or
is
this
the
aim
and
limit
of
his
destiny
schwarz
i
know
not
charles
thou
hast
said
well
and
wilt
have
done
better
if
thou
never
seekest
to
know
brother
i
have
looked
on
men
their
insect
cares
and
their
giant
projects
their
plans
and
occupations
their
intensely
eager
race
after
happiness
one
trusting
to
the
fleetness
of
his
horse
another
to
the
nose
of
his
ass
a
third
to
his
own
legs
this
checkered
lottery
of
life
in
which
so
many
stake
their
innocence
and
their
leaven
to
snatch
a
prize
and
blanks
are
all
they
draw
for
they
find
too
late
that
there
was
no
prize
in
the
wheel
it
is
a
drama
brother
enough
to
bring
tears
into
your
eyes
while
it
shakes
your
sides
with
laughter

how
gloriously
the
sun
is
setting
yonder
charles
absorbed
in
the
scene
so
dies
a
hero
worthy
of
adoration
schwarz
you
seem
deeply
moved
charles
when
i
was
but
a
boy
it
was
my
darling
thought
to
live
like
him
like
him
to
die
with
suppressed
grief
it
was
a
boyish
thought
grimm
it
was
indeed
charles
there
was
a
time
pressing
his
hat
down
upon
his
face
i
would
be
alone

cheering
rays

frail
reed

perdition

glad

howling
abaddon

strange
i
never

with
melancholy
oh
that
i
might
return
again
to
my
womb
that
i
might
be
born
a
beggar
i
should
desire
no
more
no
more
oh
heaven
but
that
i
might
be
like
one
of
those
poor
laborers
oh
i
would
toil
till
the
blood
streamed
down
my
temples

buy
myself
the
luxury
of
one
guiltless
slumber
the
blessedness
of
a
single
tear
grimm
to
the
others
a
little
patience
the
paroxysm

me
two
legs
and
a
neck
as
i
was
frolicking
along
the
steep
sandbanks
of
the
river
plump
in
a
moment
the
whole
concern
slid
from
under
me
and
i
after
it
some
ten
fathoms
deep
there
i
lay
and
as
i
was
recovering
my
five
senses
lo
and

most
sparkling

much
amiss

charles
returns
him
the
hat
and
wipes
his
face
but
you
are
covered
with
mud
schweitzer

see
the
scar

bohemian
horseman
marked

scars

was
a
hot
day
work

only
one
man
lost
poor
roller
he
died
a
noble
death
a
marble
monument
would
be
erected
to
his
memory
had
he
died
in
any
other
cause
than
mine
let
this
suffice
he
wipes
the
tears
from
his
eyes
how
many
did
you
say
of
the
enemy
were
left
on
the
field
schweitzer
a
hundred

sixty
huzzars

some
forty

be
chums
charles
coming
nearer
do
you
know
the
captain
kosinsky
thou
art
he
in
those
features
that
air
who
can
look
at
thee
and
doubt
it
looks
earnestly
at
him
for
some
time
i
have
always
wished
to
see
the
man
with
the
annihilating
look
as
he
sat
on
the
ruins
of
carthage
that
wish
is
realized
alluding
to
caius
marius
see
plutarch
lives
schweitzer
a
mettlesome
fellow
charles
and
what
brings
you
to
me
kosinsky
oh
captain
my
more
than
cruel
fate
i
have
suffered
shipwrecked
on
the
stormy
ocean
of
the
world
i
have
seen
all
my
fondest
hopes
perish
and
nought
remains
to
me
but
a
remembrance
of
the
bitter
past
which
would
drive
me
to
madness
were
i
not
to
drown
it
by
directing
my
energies
to
new
objects
charles
another
arraignment
of
the
ways
of
providence
proceed
kosinsky
i
became
a
soldier
misfortune
still
followed
me
in
the
army
i
made
a
venture
to
the
indies
and
my
ship
was
shivered
on
the
rocks
nothing
but
frustrated
hopes
at
last
i
heard
tell
far
and
wide
of
your
valiant
deeds
incendiarisms
as
they
called
them
and
i
came
straightway
hither
a
distance
of
thirty
leagues
firmly
resolved
to
serve
under
you
if
you
will
deign
to
accept
my
services
i
entreat
thee
noble
captain
refuse
me
not
schweitzer
with
a
leap
into
the
air
hurrah
hurrah
our
roller
replaced
ten
an
brother
for
our
troop
charles
what
is
your
name
kosinsky
kosinsky
charles
what
kosinsky
and
do
you
know
that
you
are
but
a
thoughtless
boy
and
are
embarking
on
the
most
weighty
passage
of
your
life
as
heedlessly
as
a
giddy
girl
you
will
find
no
playing
at
bowls
or
ninepins
here
as
you
probably
imagine
kosinsky
i
understand
you
sir
i
am
is
true
but
years
old
but
i
have
seen
swords
glittering
and
have
heard
balls
whistling
around
me
charles
indeed
young
gentleman
and
was
it
for
this
that
you
took
fencing
lessons
to
run
poor
travellers
through
the
body
for
the
sake
of
a
dollar
or
stab
women
in
the
back
go
go
you
have
played
truant
to
your
nurse
because
she
shook
the
rod
at
you
schweitzer
why
what
the
devil
captain
what
are
you
about
do
you
mean
to
turn
away
such
a
hercules
does
he
not
look
as
if
he
could
baste
marechal
saxe
across
the
ganges
with
a
ladle
charles
because
your
silly
schemes
miscarry
you
come
here
to
turn
rogue
and
assassin
murder
boy
do
you
know
the
meaning
of
that
word
you
may
have
slumbered
in
peace
after
cropping
a
few
but
to
have
a
murder
on
your
soul
kosinsky
all
the
murders
you
bid
me
commit
be
upon
my
head
charles
what
are
you
so
do
you
take
measure
of
a
man
to
catch
him
by
flattery
how
do
you
know
that
i
am
not
haunted
by
terrific
dreams
or
that
i
shall
not
tremble
on
my
how
much
have
you
already
done
of
which
you
have
considered
the
responsibility
kosinsky
very
little
i
must
confess
excepting
this
long
journey
to
you
noble
count
charles
has
your
tutor
let
the
story
of
robin
hood
get
into
your
hands
such
careless
rascals
ought
to
be
sent
to
the
galleys
and
has
it
heated
your
childish
fancy
and
infected
you
with
the
mania
of
becoming
a
hero
are
you
thirsting
for
honor
and
fame
would
you
buy
immortality
by
deeds
of
incendiarism
mark
me
ambitious
youth
no
laurel
blooms
for
the
incendiary
no
triumph
awaits
the
victories
of
the
bandit
nothing
but
curses
danger
death
disgrace
do
you
see
the
gibbet
yonder
on
the
hill
spiegel
going
up
and
down
indignantly
oh
how
stupid
how
abominably
unpardonably
stupid
that
not
the
way
i
went
to
work
in
a
very
different
manner
kosinsky
what
should
he
fear
who
fears
not
death
charles
bravo
capital
you
have
made
good
use
of
your
time
at
school
you
have
got
your
seneca
cleverly
by
heart
but
my
good
friend
you
will
not
be
able
with
these
fine
phrases
to
cajole
nature
in
the
hour
of
suffering
they
will
never
blunt
the
biting
tooth
of
remorse
ponder
on
it
well
my
son
takes
him
by
the
hand
i
advise
you
as
a
father
first
learn
the
depth
of
the
abyss
before
you
plunge
headlong
into
it
if
in
this
world
you
can
catch
a
single
glimpse
of
happiness
moments
may
come
when
and
then
it
may
be
too
late
here
you
step
out
as
it
were
beyond
the
pale
of
humanity
you
must
either
be
more
than
human
or
a
demon
once
more
my
son
if
but
a
single
spark
of
hope
glimmer
for
you
elsewhere
fly
this
fearful
compact
where
nought
but
despair
enters
unless
a
higher
wisdom
has
so
ordained
it
you
may
deceive
yourself
believe
me
it
is
possible
to
mistake
that
for
strength
of
mind
which
in
reality
is
nothing
more
than
despair
take
my
counsel
mine
and
depart
quickly
kosinsky
no
i
will
not
stir
if
my
entreaties
fail
to
move
you
hear
but
the
story
of
my
misfortunes
and
then
you
will
force
the
dagger
into
my
hand
as
eagerly
as
you
now
seek
to
withhold
it
seat
yourselves
awhile
on
the
grass
and
listen
charles
i
will
hear
your
story
kosinsky
know
then
that
i
am
a
bohemian
nobleman
by
the
early
death
of
my
father
i
became
master
of
large
possessions
the
scene
of
my
domain
was
a
paradise
for
it
contained
an
angel
a
maid
adorned
with
all
the
charms
of
blooming
youth
and
chaste
as
the
light
of
heaven
but
to
whom
do
i
talk
of
this
it
falls
unheeded
on
your
cars
ye
never
loved
ye
were
never
beloved
schweitzer
gently
gently
the
captain
grows
red
as
fire
charles
no
more
i
hear
you
some
other
time
or
or
after
i
have
seen
blood
kosinsky
blood
blood
only
hear
on
blood
will
fill
your
whole
soul
she
was
of
citizen
birth
a
german
but
her
look
dissolved
all
the
prejudices
of
aristocracy
with
blushing
modesty
she
received
the
bridal
ring
from
my
hand
and
on
the
morrow
i
was
to
have
led
my
amelia
to
the
altar
charles
rises
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
my
intoxicating
dream
of
happiness
and
while
our
nuptials
were
preparing
an
express
summoned
me
to
court
i
obeyed
the
summons
letters
were
shown
me
which
i
was
said
to
have
written
full
of
treasonable
matter
i
grew
scarlet
with
indignation
at
such
malice
they
deprived
me
of
my
sword
thrust
me
into
prison
and
all
my
senses
forsook
me
schweitzer
and
in
the
meantime
go
on
i
already
scent
the
game
kosinsky
there
i
lay
a
whole
month
and
knew
not
what
was
taking
place
i
was
full
of
anxiety
for
my
amelia
who
i
was
sure
would
suffer
the
pangs
of
death
every
moment
in
apprehension
of
my
fate
at
last
the
prime
minister
makes
his
appearance
congratulates
me
in
words
on
the
establishment
of
my
innocence
reads
to
me
a
warrant
of
discharge
and
returns
me
my
sword
i
flew
in
triumph
to
my
castle
to
the
arms
of
my
amelia
but
she
had
disappeared
she
had
been
carried
off
it
was
said
at
midnight
no
one
knew
whither
and
no
eye
had
beheld
her
since
a
suspicion
instantly
flashed
across
my
mind
i
rushed
to
the
capital
i
made
inquiries
at
court
all
eyes
were
upon
me
no
one
would
give
me
information
at
last
i
discovered
her
through
a
grated
window
of
the
palace
she
threw
me
a
small
billet
schweitzer
did
i
not
say
so
kosinsky
death
and
destruction
the
contents
were
these
they
had
given
her
the
choice
between
seeing
me
put
to
death
and
becoming
the
mistress
of
the
prince
in
the
struggle
between
honor
and
love
she
chose
the
latter
and
with
a
bitter
smile
i
was
saved
schweitzer
and
what
did
you
do
then
kosinsky
then
i
stood
like
one
transfixed
with
a
thunderbolt
blood
was
my
first
thought
blood
my
last
foaming
at
the
mouth
i
ran
to
my
quarters
armed
myself
with
a
sword
and
with
all
haste
rushed
to
the
minister
house
for
he
he
alone
had
been
the
fiendish
pander
they
must
have
observed
me
in
the
street
for
as
i
went
up
i
found
all
the
doors
fastened
i
searched
i
enquired
he
was
gone
they
said
to
the
prince
i
went
straight
thither
but
nobody
there
would
know
anything
about
him
i
return
force
the
doors
find
the
base
wretch
and
was
on
the
point
when
five
or
six
servants
suddenly
rushed
on
me
from
behind
and
wrenched
the
weapon
from
my
hands
schweitzer
stamping
the
ground
and
so
the
fellow
got
off
clear
and
you
lost
your
labor
kosinsky
i
was
arrested
accused
criminally
prosecuted
degraded
and
mark
this
transported
beyond
the
frontier
as
a
special
favor
my
estates
were
confiscated
to
the
minister
and
amelia
remained
in
the
clutches
of
the
tiger
where
she
weeps
and
mourns
away
her
life
while
my
vengeance
must
keep
a
fast
and
crouch
submissively
to
the
yoke
of
despotism
schweitzer
rising
and
whetting
his
sword
that
is
grist
to
our
mill
captain
there
is
something
here
for
the
incendiaries
charles
who
has
been
walking
up
and
down
in
violent
agitation

a
sudden
start

the
robbers

baggage

and
this
corner
of
the
fence
where
i
so
often
watched
in
ambuscade
to
teaze
old
towzer
and
down
there
in
the
green
valley
where
as
the
great
alexander
i
led
my
macedonians
to
the
battle
of
arbela
and
the
grassy
hillock
yonder
from
which
i
hurled
the
persian
satrap

waved
on

my
victorious
banner

captive
when
the
clanking
of
his
chains
awakes
him
from
his
dream
of
liberty
no
let
me
return
to
my
wretchedness
the
captive
had
forgotten
the
light
of
day
but
the
dream
of
liberty
flashes
past
his
eyes
like
a
blaze
of
lightning
in
the
night
which
leaves
it
darker
than
before
farewell
ye

once
ye
saw
charles
as
a
boy
and
then
charles
was
happy
now
ye
have
seen
the
man
his
happiness
turned
to
despair
he
moves
rapidly
towards
the
most
distant
point
of
the
landscape
where
he
suddenly
stops
and
casts
a
melancholy
look
across
to
the
castle
not
to
behold
her
not
even
one
look
and
only
a
wall
between
me
and
amelia
no
see
her
i
must
and
him
too
though
it
crush
me
he
turns
back
father
father
thy
son
approaches
away
with
thee
black
reeking
gore
away
with
that
grim
ghastly
look
of
death
oh
give
me
but
this
one
hour
free
amelia
father
thy
charles
approaches
he
goes
quickly
towards
the
castle
torment
me
when
the
morning
dawns
give
me
no
rest
with
the
coming
night
beset
me
in
frightful
dreams
but
oh
poison
not
this
my
only
hour
of
bliss
he
is
standing
at
the
gate
what
is

i
feel
what

this

these
shudders
foreboding
terrors
enters

gallery
in
the

in
some
editions
this
is
the
third
scene
and
there
is
no
second
enter
charles
von
moor
amelia
amelia
and
are
you
sure
that
you
should
know
his
portrait
among
these
pictures
charles
oh
most
certainly
his
image
has
always
been
fresh
in
my
memory
passing
along
thee
pictures
this
is
not
it
amelia
you
are
right
he
was
the
first
count
and
received
his
patent
of
nobility
from
frederic
barbarossa
to
whom
he
rendered
some
service
against
the
corsairs
charles
still
reviewing
the
pictures
neither
is
it
this
nor
this
nor
that
it
is
not
among
these
at
all
amelia
nay
look
more
attentively
i
thought
you
knew
him
charles
as
well
as
my
own
father
this
picture
wants
the
sweet
expression
around
the
mouth
which
distinguished
him
from
among
a
thousand
it
is
not
he
amelia
you
surprise
me
what
not
seen
him
for
eighteen
years
and
still
charles
quickly
with
a
hectic
blush
yes
this
is
he
he
stands
as
if
struck
by
lightning
amelia
an
excellent
man
charles
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
the
picture
father
father
forgive
me
yes
an
excellent
man
he
wipes
his
eyes
a
godlike
man
amelia
you
seem
to
take
a
deep
interest
in
him
charles
oh
an
excellent
man
and
he
is
gone
you
say
amelia
gone
as
our
best
joys
perish
gently
taking
him
by
the
hand
dear
sir
no
happiness
ripens
in
this
world
charles
most
true
most
true
and
have
you
already
proved
this
truth
by
sad
experience
you
who
can
scarcely
yet
have
seen
your
year
amelia
yes
alas
i
have
proved
it
whatever
lives
lives
to
die
in
sorrow
we
engage
our
hearts
and
grasp
after
the
things
of
this
world
only
to
undergo
the
pang
of
losing
them
charles
what
can
you
have
lost
and
yet
so
young
amelia
nothing
everything
nothing
shall
we
go
on
count
in
the
acting
edition
is
added
moor
and
would
you
learn
forgetfulness
in
that
holy
garb
there
pointing
to
a
nun
habit
amelia
i
hope
to
do
so
shall
we
continue
our
walk
sir
charles
in
such
haste
whose
portrait
is
that
on
the
right
there
is
an
unhappy
look
about
that
countenance
methinks
amelia
that
portrait
on
the
left
is
the
son
of
the
count
the
present
count
come
let
us
pass
on
charles
but
this
portrait
on
the
right
amelia
will
you
not
continue
your
walk
sir
charles

this
portrait
on
the
right
hand

are
in
tears

in
precipitation

down
her
cheeks
she
loves
me
wretch
hast
thou
deserved
this
at
her
hands
stand
i
not
here
like
a
condemned
criminal
before
the
fatal
block
is
this
the
couch
on
which
we
so
often
sat
where
i
have
hung
in
rapture
on
her
neck
are
these
my
ancestral
halls
overcome
by
the
sight
of
his
father
portrait
thou
thou
flames
of
fire
darting
from
thine
eyes
his
curse
his
curse
he
disowns
me
where
am
i
my
sight
grows
dim
horrors
of
the
living
god
was
i
i
that
killed
my
father
he
rushes
off
enter
francis
von
moor
in
deep
thought
francis
away
with
that
image
away
with
it
craven
heart
why
dost
thou
tremble
and
before
whom
have
i
not
felt
during
the
few
hours
that
the
count
has
been
within
these
walls
as
if
a
spy
from
hell
were
gliding
at
my
heels
methinks
i
should
know
him
there
is
something
so
lofty
so
familiar
in
his
wild
sunburnt
features
which
makes
me
tremble
amelia
too
is
not
indifferent
towards
him
does
she
not
dart
eager
languishing
looks
at
the
fellow
looks
of
which
she
is
so
chary
to
all
the
world
beside
did
i
not
see
her
drop
those
stealthy
tears
into
the
wine
which
behind
my
back
he
quaffed
so
eagerly
that
he
seemed
to
swallow
the
very
glass
yes
i
saw
it
i
saw
it
in
the
mirror
with
my
own
eyes
take
care
francis
look
about
you
some
monster
is
lurking
beneath
all
this
he
stops
with
a
searching
look
before
the
portrait
of
charles
his
long
neck
his
black
eyes
hem
hem
his
dark
overhanging
bushy
eyebrows
suddenly
starting
back
malicious
hell
dost
thou
send
me
this
suspicion
it
is
charles
yes
all
his
features
are
reviving
before
me
it
is
he
despite
his
mask
it
is
he
death
and
damnation
goes
up
and
down
with
agitated
steps
is
it
for
this
that
i
have
sacrificed
my
nights
that
i
have
mowed
down
mountains
and
filled
up
chasms
for
this
that
i
have
turned
rebel
against
all
the
instincts
of
humanity
to
have
this
vagabond
outcast
blunder
in
at
last
and
destroy
all
my
cunningly
devised
fabric
but
gently
gently
what
remains
to
be
done
is
but
child
play
have
i
not
already
waded
up
to
my
very
ears
in
mortal
sin
seeing
how
far
the
shore
lies
behind
me
it
would
be
madness
to
attempt
to
swim
back
to
return
is
now
out
of
the
question
grace
itself
would
be
beggared
and
infinite
mercy
become
bankrupt
were
they
to
be
responsible
for
all
my
liabilities
then
onward
like
a
man
he
rings
the
bell
let
him
be
gathered
to
the
spirit
of
his
father
and
now
come
on
for
the
dead
i
care
not
daniel
ho
daniel
i
wager
a
trifle
they
have
already
inveigled
him
too
into
the
plot
against
me
he
looks
so
full
of
mystery
enter
daniel
daniel
what
is
your
pleasure
my
master
francis
nothing
go
fill
this
goblet
with
wine
and
quickly
exit
daniel
wait
a
little
old
man
i
shall
find
you
out
i
will
fix
my
eye
upon
you
so
keenly
that
your
stricken
conscience
shall
betray
itself
through
your
mask
he
shall
die
he
is
but
a
sorry
bungler
who
leaves
his
work
half
finished
and
then
looks
on
idly
trusting
to
chance
for
what
may
come
of
it
enter
daniel
with
the
wine
bring
it
here
look
me
steadfastly
in
the
face
how
your
knees

together

been
doing
daniel

honored
master

poor
soul

wine

with
it
quickly

have
you
put
into
the
wine
daniel
heaven

me
what
i
in
the
wine
francis
you
have
poisoned

you
not
as
white
as
snow

who
gave
it
you
the
count
is
it
not
so
the
count
gave
it
you
daniel
the
count
jesu
maria
the
count
has
not
given
me
anything
francis
grasping
him
tight
i
will
throttle
you
till
you
are
black
in
the
face
you
liar
nothing
why
then
are
you
so
often
closeted
together
he
and
you
and
amelia
and
what
are
you
always
whispering
about
out
with
it
what
secrets
eh
what
secrets
has
he
confided
to
you
daniel
i
call
the
almighty
to
witness
that
he
has
not
confided
any
secrets
to
me
francis
do
you
mean
to
deny
it
what
schemes
have
you
been
hatching
to
get
rid
of
me
am
i
to
be
smothered
in
my
sleep
or
is
my
throat
to
be
cut
in
shaving
or
am
i
to
be
poisoned
in
wine
or
chocolate
eh
out
with
it

with
it
or

i
to
have
my
quietus
administered
in
my
soup
out
with
it
i
know
it
all
daniel
may
heaven
so
help
me
in
the
hour
of
need
as
i
now
tell
you
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
pure
unvarnished
truth
francis
well
this
time
i
will
forgive
you
but
the
money
he
most
certainly
put
money
into
your
purse
and
he
pressed
your
hand
more
warmly
than
is
customary
something
in
the
manner
of
an
old
acquaintance
daniel
never
indeed
sir
francis
he
told
you
for
instance
that
he
had
known
you
before
that
you
ought
to
know
him
that
the
scales
would
some
day
fall
from
your
eyes
that
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
never
spoke
thus
to
you
daniel
not
a
word
of
the
kind
francis
that
certain
circumstances
restrained
him
that
one
must
sometimes
wear
a
mask
in
order
to
get
at
one
enemies
that
he
would
be
revenged
most
terribly
revenged
daniel
not
a
syllable
of
all
this
francis
what
nothing
at
all
recollect
yourself
that
he
knew
the
old
count
well
most
intimately
that
he
loved
him
loved
him
exceedingly
loved
him
like
a
son
daniel
something
of
that
sort
i
remember
to
have
heard
him
say
francis
turning
pale
did
he
say
so
did
he
really
how
let
me
hear
he
said
he
was
my
brother
daniel
astonished
what
my
master
he
did
not
say
that
but
as
lady
amelia
was
conducting
him
through
the
gallery
i
was
just
dusting
the
picture
frames
he
suddenly
stood
still
before
the
portrait
of
my
late
master
and
seemed
thunderstruck
lady
amelia
pointed
it
out
and
said
an
excellent
man
yes
a
most
excellent
man
he
replied
wiping
a
tear
from
his
eye
francis
hark
daniel
you
know
i
have
ever
been
a
kind
master
to
you
i
have
given
you
food
and
raiment
and
have
spared
you
labor
in
consideration
of
your
advanced
age
daniel
for
which
may
heaven
reward
you
and
i
on
my
part
have
always
served
you
faithfully
francis
that
is
just
what
i
was
going
to
say
you
have
never
in
all
your
life
contradicted
me
for
you
know
much
too
well
that
you
owe
me
obedience
in
all
things
whatever
i
may
require
of
you
daniel
in
all
things
with
all
my
heart
so
it
be
not
against
god
and
my
conscience
francis
stuff
nonsense
are
you
not
ashamed
of
yourself
an
old
man
and
believe
that
christmas
tale
go
daniel
that
was
a
stupid
remark
you
know
that
i
am
your
master
it
is
on
me
that
god
and
conscience
will
be
avenged
if
indeed
there
be
a
god
and
a
conscience
daniel
clasping
his
hands
together
merciful
heaven
francis
by
your
obedience
do
you
understand
that
word
by
your
obedience
i
command
you
with
dawn
the
count
must
no
longer
be
found
among
the
living
daniel
merciful
heaven
and
wherefore
francis
by
your
blind
obedience
i
shall
rely
upon
you
implicitly
daniel
on
me
may
the
blessed
virgin
have
mercy
on
me
on
me
what
evil
then
have
i
an
old
man
done
francis
there
is
no
time
now
for
reflection
your
fate
is
in
my
hands
would
you
rather
pine
away
the
remainder
of
your
days
in
the
deepest
of
my
dungeons
where
hunger
shall
compel
you
to
gnaw
your
own
bones
and
burning
thirst
make
you
suck
your
own
blood
or
would
you
rather
eat
your
bread
in
peace
and
have
rest
in
your
old
age
daniel
what
my
lord
peace
and
rest
in
my
old
age
and
i
a
murderer
francis
answer
my
question
daniel
my
gray
hairs
my
gray
hairs
francis
yes
or
no
daniel
no
god
have
mercy
upon
me
francis
in
the
act
of
going
very
well
you
shall
have
need
of
it
daniel
detains
him
and
falls
on
his
knees
before
him
daniel
mercy
master
mercy
francis
yes
or
no
daniel
most
gracious
master
i
am
this
day
years
of
age
and
have
honored
my
father
and
my
mother
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
have
never
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
defrauded
any
one
to
the
value
of
a
farthing
and
i
have
adhered
to
my
creed
truly
and
honestly
and
have
served
in
your
house
years
and
am
now
calmly
awaiting
a
quiet
happy
end
oh
master
master
violently
clasping
his
knees
and
would
you
deprive
me
of
my
only
solace
in
death
that
the
gnawing
worm
of
an
evil
conscience
may
cheat
me
of
my
last
prayer
that
i
may
go
to
my
long
home
an
abomination
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
no
no
my
dearest
best
most
excellent
most
gracious
master
you
do
not
ask
that
of
an
old
man
turned
threescore
and
ten
francis
yes
or
no
what
is
the
use
of
all
this
palaver
daniel
i
will
serve
you
from
this
day
forward
more
diligently
than
ever
i
will
wear
out
my
old
bones
in
your
service
like
a
common
i
will
rise
earlier
and
lie
down
later
oh
and
i
will
remember
you
in
my
prayers
night
and
morning
and
god
will
not
reject
the
prayer
of
an
old
man
francis
obedience
is
better
than
sacrifice
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
hangman
standing
upon
ceremony
when
he
was
told
to
execute
a
sentence
daniel
that
is
very
true
but
to
murder
an
innocent
man
one
francis
am
i
responsible
to
you
is
the
axe
to
question
the
hangman
why
he
strikes
this
way
and
not
that
but
see
how
forbearing
i
am
i
offer
you
a
reward
for
performing
what
you
owe
me
in
virtue
of
your
allegiance
daniel
but
when
i
swore
allegiance
to
you
i
at
least
hoped
that
i
should
be
allowed
to
remain
a
christian
francis
no
contradiction
look
you
i
give
you
the
whole
day
to
think
about
it
ponder
well
on
it
happiness
or
misery
do
you
hear
do
you
understand
the
extreme
of
happiness
or
the
extreme
of
misery
i
can
do
wonders
in
the
way
of
torture
daniel
after
some
reflection
i
do
it
i
will
do
it
exit
francis
the
temptation
is
strong
and
i
should
think
he
was
not
born
to
die
a
martyr
to
his
faith
have
with
you
sir
count
according
to
all
ordinary
calculations
you
will
sup
with
old
beelzebub
in
these
matters
all
depends
upon
one
view
of
a
thing
and
he
is
a
fool
who
takes
any
view
that
is
contrary
to
his
own
interest
a
father
quaffs
perhaps
a
bottle
of
wine
more
than
ordinary
he
is
in
a
certain
mood
the
result
is
a
human
being
the
last
thing
that
was
thought
of
in
the
affair
well
i
too
am
in
a
certain
mood
and
the
result
is
that
a
human
being
perishes
and
surely
there
is
more
of
reason
and
purpose
in
this
than
there
was
in
his
production
if
the
birth
of
a
man
is
the
result
of
an
animal
paroxysm
who
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
attach
any
importance
to
the
negation
of
his
birth
a
curse
upon
the
folly
of
our
nurses
and
teachers
who
fill
our
imaginations
with
frightful
tales
and
impress
fearful
images
of
punishment
upon
the
plastic
brain
of
childhood
so
that
involuntary
shudders
shake
the
limbs
of
the
man
with
icy
fear
arrest
his
boldest
resolutions
and
chain
his
awakening
reason
in
the
fetters
of
superstitious
darkness
murder
what
a
hell
full
of
furies
hovers
around
that
word
yet
is
no
more
than
if
nature
forgets
to
bring
forth
one
man
more
or
the
doctor
makes
a
mistake
and
thus
the
whole
phantasmagoria
vanishes
it
was
something
and
it
is
nothing
does
not
this
amount
to
exactly
the
same
thing
as
though
it
had
been
nothing
and
came
to
nothing
and
about
nothing
it
is
hardly
worth
while
to
waste
a
word
man
is
made
of
filth
and
for
a
time
wades
in
filth
and
produces
filth
and
sinks
back
into
filth
till
at
last
he
fouls
the
boots
of
his
own
posterity
to
what
base
uses
we
may
return
horatio
why
may
not
imagination
trace
the
noble
dust
of
alexander
till
we
find
it
stopping
a
bunghole
hamlet
act
v
sc
that
is
the
burden
of
the
song
the
filthy
cycle
of
human
fate
and
with
that
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
sir
brother
conscience
that
splenetic
gouty
moralist
may
drive
shrivelled
old
drones
out
of
brothels
and
torture
usurers
on
their
deathbeds
with
me
it
shall
never
more
have
audience

another
room
in
the
castle

favor

great
deal

to
kiss
your
hand

father

hand

hand

quickly
and
falls
down
before
him

charles
charles
startled

composes
himself
and
says
in
a
distant
tone
what

friend

do
understand
you
daniel
yes

deny

my
dearest

excellent
young
master

i
poor
old
man
should
live
to
have
the
joy

a
stupid
blockhead

i
did
not
at
a
glance
oh
gracious
powers
and
you
are
really
come
back
and
the
dear
old
master

underground
and
here

are
again
what
a
purblind
dolt
i
was
to
be
sure
striking
his
forehead
that
i
did
not
on
the
instant
oh
dear
me
could
have
dreamt
it
what
i
have
so
often
prayed
for
with
tears
oh
mercy

there
he
stands
again
as
large
as
life
in
the
old
room
charles
what
all
this
oration
about
are
you
in
a
fit
of
delirium
and
have
escaped
from
your
keepers
or
are
you
rehearsing
a
part
with
me
daniel
oh
fie
fie
it
is
not
pretty
of
you
to
make
game
of
an
old
servant
that
scar
eh
do
you
remember
it
good
heaven
what
a
fright
you
put
me
into
i
always
loved
you
so
dearly
and
what
misery
you
might
have
brought
upon
me
you
were
sitting
in
my
lap
do
you
remember
there
in
the
round
chamber
has
all
that
quite
vanished
from
your
memory
and
the
cuckoo
too
that
you
were
so
fond
of
listening
to
only
think
the
cuckoo
is
broken
broken
all
to
shivers
old
susan
smashed
it
in
sweeping
the
room
yes
indeed
and
there
you
sat
in
my
lap
and
cried
cockhorse
and
i
ran
off
to
fetch
your
wooden
horse
mercy
on
me
what
business
had
i
thoughtless
old
fool
to
leave
you
alone
and
how
i
felt
as
if
i
were
in
a
boiling
caldron
when
i
heard
you
screaming
in
the
passage
and
when
i
rushed
in
there
was
your
red
blood
gushing
forth
and
you
lying
on
the
ground
oh
by
the
blessed
virgin
did
i
not
feel
as
if
a
bucket

gone
into
your
eye

the
right
hand
as
long
as
i
live
said
i
never
again
shall
any
child
in
my
charge
get
hold
of
a

the
little
house

what

you
muttering
about
daniel
in
a
voice
and
to
be
sure
when
a
man
rises
from
the
dead
thus
uninvited
your
brother
was
the
sole
heir
of
our
late
master
charles
old
man
what
is
it
you
are
muttering
between
your
teeth
as
if
some
dreadful
secret
were
hovering
on
your
tongue
which
you
fear
to
utter
and
yet
ought
out
with
it
daniel
but
i
would
rather
gnaw
my
old
bones
with
hunger
and
suck
my
own
blood
for
thirst
than
gain
a
life
of
luxury
by
murder
exit
hastily
charles
starting
up
after
a
terrible
pause
betrayed
betrayed
it
flashes
upon
my
soul
like
lightning
a
fiendish
trick
a
murderer
and
a
robber
through
machinations
calumniated
by
him
my
letters
falsified
suppressed
his
heart
full
of
love
oh
what
a
monstrous
fool
was
i
his
fatherly
heart
full
of
love
oh
villainy
villainy
it
would
have
cost
me
but
once
kneeling
at
his
feet
a
tear
would
have
done
it
oh
blind
blind
fool
that
i
was
running
up
against
the
wall
i
might
have
been
happy
oh
villainy
villainy
knavishly
yes
knavishly
cheated
out
of
all
happiness
in
this
life
he
runs
up
and
down
in
a
rage
a
murderer
a
robber
all
through
a
knavish
trick
he
was
not
even
angry
not
a
thought
of
cursing
ever
entered
his
heart
oh
miscreant
inconceivable
hypocritical
abominable
miscreant
enter
kosinsky
kosinsky

joking
charles
in
a
commanding
tone

leave
every
thing
behind
and
let
no
eye
see
you
exit
kosinsky
i
fly
from
these
walls

me
raving
mad
and
he
my
father

thou
hast
made
me
the
most
miserable
wretch
on
earth

not
brotherly

the
fruits
of
thy
crime
in
quiet
my
presence
shall
no
longer
embitter
thy
enjoyment
but
surely
this
was
not
acting
like
a
brother

oblivion
shroud
thy
misdeed
forever
and
death
not
bring
it
back
to
light
enter
kosinsky
kosinsky
the
horses

ready
saddled

poisoned
cup
of
happiness

were
his
very
words
and
spoken
with
such
expressionsuch
a
voice
oh

summoned
up
a
thousand
dear
remembrances
scenes
of
past
delight
as
in
my
youthful
days
of
happiness
my
golden
of
love
the
nightingale
sung
with
the
same
sweetness
the
flowers
breathed
the
same
delicious
fragrance
as
when
i
used
to
hang
enraptured
on
his
neck
here
in
the
acting
edition
is
added
if
the
spirits
of
the
departed
wander
among
the
living
then
must
this
stranger
be
charles

false
perfidious
heart
and
dost
thou
seek
thus
artfully
to
veil
thy
perjury
no
no
begone
forever
from
my
soul
thou
sinful
image
i
have
not
broken
my
oath
thou
only
one
avaunt
from
my
soul
ye
treacherous
impious
wishes
in
the
heart
where
charles
reigns

son
of
earth

dwell
but
why
my
soul
dost
thou
thus
constantly
thus
obstinately
turn
towards
this
stranger

he
not
cling
to
my
heart
in
the
very
image
of
my
only
one
is
he
not
his
inseparable
companion

my
thoughts

gate

starts
up

i
am
rooted
to
the
spot
i
can
not
fly
forsake
me
not
good
heaven
no
thou
shalt
not
tear
me
from
my
charles
my
soul
has
no
room
for
two
deities
i
am
but
a
mortal
maid
she
draws
the
picture
of
charles
from
her
bosom
thou
my
charles
be
thou
my
guardian
angel
against
this
stranger
this
invader
of
our
loves
at
thee
will
i
look
at
thee
nor
turn
away
my
eyes
nor
cast
one
sinful
look
towards
him
she
sits
silent
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
picture
charles
you
here
lady
amelia
and
so
sad
and
a
tear
upon
that
picture
amelia
gives
him
no
answer
and
who
is
the
happy
man
for
whom
these
silver
drops
fall
from
an
angel
eyes
may
i
be
permitted
to
look
at
he
endeavors
to
look
at
the
picture
amelia
no
yes

and
does
he
deserve
to
be
so
idolized

charles
i
should
have
envied
him
amelia
adored
you
mean
charles
ha
amelia
oh

would
so
have
loved
him

so
much

in
his
face
in
his
eyes
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
which
was
so
like
yours
that
i
love
so
dearly
charles
casts
his
eyes
down
to
the
ground
here
where
you
are
standing
he
has
stood
a
thousand
times
and
by
his
side
one
who
by
his
side
forgot
heaven
and
earth
here
his
eyes
feasted
on
nature
most
glorious
panorama
which
as
if
conscious
of
his
approving
glance
seemed
to
increase
in
beauty
under
the
approbation
of
her
masterpiece
here
he
held
the
audience
of
the
air
captive
with
his
heavenly
music
here
from
this
bush
he
plucked
roses
and
plucked
those
roses
for
me
here
here
he
lay
on
my
neck
here
he
imprinted
burning
kisses
on
my
lips
and
the
flowers
hung
their
heads
with
pleasure
beneath
the
of
the
lovers
in
the
acting
edition
the
scene
changes
materially
at
this
point
and
the
most
sentimental
part
of
the
whole
drama
is
transformed
into
the
most
voluptuous
the
stage
direction
here
is
they
give
way
to
their
transports
without
control
and
mingle
their
kisses
moor
hangs
in
ecstacy
on
her
lips
while
she
sinks
half
delirious
on
the
couch
o
charles
now
avenge
thyself
my
vow
is
broken
moor
tearing
himself
away
from
her
as
if
in
frenzy
can
this
be
hell
that
still
pursues
me
gazing
on
her
i
felt
so
happy
amelia
perceiving
the
ring
upon
her
finger
starts
up
from
the
couch
what
art
thou
still
there
on
that
guilty
hand
witness
of
my
perjury

with
thee
she
pulls
the
ring
from
her

the
very
ring

of
our
mutual
faith

pleasures
of
thy
crime

his
emotion
is
nothing

amelia
amelia
starting
up
your
amelia
moor
mournfully
oh
she
was
such
a
lovely
maiden
and
faithful
as
an
angel
when
we
parted
we
exchanged
rings
and
vowed
eternal
constancy
she
heard
that
i
was
dead
believed
it
yet
remained
constant
to
the
dead
she
heard
again
that
i
was
living
yet
became
faithless
to
the
living
i
flew
into
her
arms
was
happy
as
the
blest
in
paradise

what
my
heart
was
doomed
to
feel
amelia
she
gave
me
back
my
ring
she
took
her
own
amelia

eyes
fixed
on
the
earth
in
amazement

strange
most
strange

horrible
moor
ay
strange
and
horrible
my
child
there
is
much
ay
much
for
man
to
learn
ere
his
poor
intellect
can
fathom
the
decrees
of
him
who
smiles
at
human
vows
and
weeps
at
human
projects
my
amelia
is
an
unfortunate
maiden
amelia
unfortunate
because
she
rejected
you
moor
unfortunate
because
she
embraced
the
man
she
betrayed
amelia
with
melancholy
tenderness
oh
then
she
is
indeed
unfortunate
from
my
soul
i
pity
her
she
shall
be
my
sister
but
there
is
another
and
a
better
world
charles
he
is
no

sails
on

seas
amelia
love
sails
with
him
he
wanders
through
pathless
sandy
deserts
amelia

the
burning
sand
with
verdure
and
the
barren
shrubs
with
flowers
southern
suits
scorch
his
bare
head
northern
snows
pinch
his
feet
tempestuous
hail
beats
down
on
his
temples
but
amelia
love
lulls
him
to
sleep
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
seas
and
mountains
and
skies
divide
the
lovers
but
their
souls
rise
above
this
of
clay
and
meet
in
the
paradise
of
love

appear
sad

words
of
love
rekindle
my
love
amelia
pale
what
you
love
another

believed
me
dead
and
in
my
supposed
death
she
remained
faithful
to
me
she
heard
again
that
i
was
alive
and
she
sacrificed
for
me
the
crown
of
a
saint
she
knows
that
i
am
wandering
in
deserts
and
roaming
about
in
misery
yet
her
love
follows
me
on
wings
through
deserts
and
through
misery

will
be
rewarded

better
world

bear
to
see
a
fly
suffer
his
soul

as
far
from
every
thought
of
blood
as
the
sun
is
from
the
moon
charles
suddenly
turns
away
into
a
thicket
and
looks
wildly
out
into
the
landscape
amelia
sings
playing
the
guitar
oh
hector
wilt
thou
go
forevermore
where
fierce
achilles
on
the
shore
heaps
countless
victims
patroclus
grave
who
then
thy
hapless
orphan
boy
will
rear
teach
him
to
praise
the
gods
and

a
neighboring

night
an
old
ruined
castle
in
the
centre
of
the
scene
the
band
of
robbers
encamped
on
the
ground
the
robbers
singing
to
rob
to
kill
to

to

our
pastime
is
and
daily
sport
the

claims
us
morn
and
night
so
let
be
jolly
time
is
short
a
merry
life
we
lead
and
free
a
life
of
endless
fun
our
couch
is
the
greenwood
tree
through
wind
and
storm
we
gain
our
fee
the

we
make
our

old

is
our

true

when
with
rhenish
and
rare
moselle
our

we
have
been
oiling
our
courage
burns
with
a
fiercer
swell
and
we
hand
and

with
the
lord
of

who
down
in
his
flames
is
broiling
for
fathers
slain
the
orphans
cries
the
widowed
mothers
moan
and
wail
of

bereaved
the
whimpering
sighs
like
music
sweet
our
ears
regale
beneath
the
axe
to
see
them
writhe

like

fall
dead
like
flies
such
bonny
sights
and
sounds
so
blithe
with
rapture
fill
our
ears

when
at

our
rings
the
devil
take
that
hour
payment
in
full
the
hangman
brings
and
off
the
stage
we
scour
on

a

so
then
hip
hip
hip

away
we
go

the
night

the

he

to
be
back
before
the

a
word
in

razmann
schwarz
to

should
we
not
send
out
scouts
grimm
let
him
alone
he
no
doubt
has
some
feat
in
hand
that
will
put
us
to
shame
schweitzer
then
you
are
out
by
old
harry
he
did
not
part
from
us
like
one
that
had
any
masterpiece
of
roguery
in
view
have
you
forgotten
what
he
said
as
he
marched
us
across
the
heath
the
fellow
that
takes
so
much
as
a
turnip
out
of
a
field
if
i
know
it
leaves
his
head
behind
him
as
true

what

you

hush
hush
i
know
not
what
sort
of
a
notion
you

i
have
of
liberty
that
we
should
toil
under
the
yoke
like
bullocks
while
we
are
making
such
wonderful
fine
speeches
about
independence
i
like
it
not
schweitzer
to
grimm
what
crotchet
has
that
swaggering
booby
got
in
his
numskull
i
wonder
raz
aside
to
spiegelberg
is
it
the
captain
you
mean
spiegel
hush
i
tell
you
hush
he
has
got
his
eavesdroppers
all
around
us
captain
did
you
say
who
made
him
captain
over
us
has
he
not
in
fact
usurped
that
title
which
by
right
belongs
to
me
what
is
it
for
this
that
we
stake
our
lives
that
we
endure
all
the
splenetic
caprices
of
fortunes
that
we
may
in
the
end
congratulate
ourselves
upon
being
the
serfs
of
a
slave
serfs
when
we
might
be
princes
by
heaven
razmann
i
could
never
brook
it
schweitzer
overhearing
him
to
the
others
yes
there
a
hero
for
you
he
is
just
the
man
to
do
mighty
execution
upon
frogs
with
stones
the
very
breath
of
his
nostrils
when
he
sneezes
would
blow
you
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
spiegel
to
razmann
yes
and
for
years
i
have
been
intent
upon
it
there
must
be
an
alteration
razmann
if
you
are
the
man
i
always
took
you
for
razmann
he
is
missing
he
is
almost
given
up
razmann
methinks
his
hour
is
come
what
does
not
the

so
much
as
mount

your
cheek
when
you
hear
the
chimes
of

ringing
in

have
you
not
courage
enough
to
take
the

raz
ha
satan
what

art
thou
spreading
for

it
take

then

slunk
off

along
a
brace
of

we

meditation
who
will
give
me
certainty
all

so
dark
a
confused
labyrinth
no
outlet
no
guiding
star
were
but
all
to
end
with
this
last
gasp
of
breath
to
end
like
an
empty
but
why
then
this
burning
thirst
after
happiness
wherefore
this
ideal
of
unattained
perfection
this
looking
to
an
hereafter
for
the
fulfilment
of
our
hopes
if
the
paltry
pressure
of
this
paltry
thing
putting
a
pistol
to
his
head
makes
the
wise
man
and
the
fool
the
coward
and
the
brave
the
noble
and
the
villain
equal
the
harmony
which
pervades
the
inanimate
world
is
so
divinely
perfect
why
then
should
there
be
such
discord
in

no
no
there
must

something
beyond

i

not
yet
attained
to

ye
that

victims
no
i
will
not
tremble
trembling
violently
the
shrieks
of
your
dying
agonies
your
black
convulsive
features
your
ghastly
bleeding
wounds
what
are
they
all
but
links
of
one
indissoluble
chain
of
destiny
which
hung
upon
the
temperament
of
my
father
the
life
blood
of
my
mother
the
humors
of
my
nurses
and
tutors
and
even
upon
the
holiday
pastimes
of
my
childhood
shaking
with
horror
why
has
my
perillus
made
of
me
a
brazen
bull
whose
burning
entrails
yearn
after
human
flesh
he
lifts
the
pistol
again
to
his
head
time
and

linked
together
by
a
single
instant
fearful
key

locks
behind
me
the
prisonhouse

me

whither

doom
me
to
be
sole
inhabitant
of
some
world
which
thou
hast
banished
from
thy
sight
where
darkness
and
desolation
were
all
my
prospect
then
would
my
creative
brain
people
the
silent
waste
with
its
own
images
and
i
should
have
eternity
for
leisure
to
unravel
the
complicated
picture
of
universal
wretchedness

thou
make
me

disturbed

thy
grave
has
thy
soul
left

earth
charged
with
some
foul
crime
that

the
gates
of
paradise

will
have
masses
read
to
send
thy
wandering
spirit
to
its
home
hast
thou
buried
in
the
earth
the
gold
of
widows
and
orphans
that
thou
art
driven
to
wander
howling
through
the
midnight
hour
i
will
snatch
the
hidden
treasure
from
the
clutches
of
the
infernal
dragon
though
he
should
vomit
a
thousand
redhot
flames
upon
me
and
gnash
his
sharp
teeth
against
my
sword
or
comest
thou
at
my
request
to
reveal
to

the
mysteries

blanch
with
fear
old

i
am
not

me
i
live
but
oh
a
life
indeed
of
misery
charles
what
hast
thou
not
been
buried
old
moor
i
was
buried
that
is
to
say
a
dead
dog
lies
in
the
vault
of
my
ancestors
and
i
have
been
pining
for
three
long
moons
in
this
dark
and
loathsome
dungeon
where
no
sunbeam
shines
no
warm
breeze
penetrates
where
no
friend
is
seen
where
the
hoarse
raven
croaks
and
owls
screech
their
midnight
concert
charles
heaven
and
earth
who
has
done
this
old
moor
curse
him
not
is
my
son
francis
who
did
this
charles
francis
francis
oh
eternal
chaos
old
moor
if
thou
art
a
man
and
hast
a
human
heart
oh
my
unknown
deliverer
then
listen
to
a
father
miseries
which
his
own
sons
have
heaped
upon
him
for
three
long
moons
i
have
moaned
my
pitiful
tale
to
these
flinty
walls
but
all
my
answer
was
an
empty
echo
that
seemed
to
mock
my
wailings
therefore
if
thou
art
a
man
and
hast
a
human
heart
charles
that
appeal
might
move
even
wild
beasts
to
pity
old
moor
i
lay
upon
a
sick
bed
and
had
scarcely
begun
to
recover
a
little
strength
after
a
dangerous
illness
when
a
man
was
brought
to
me
who
pretended
that
my
had
fallen
in
battle
he
brought
a
sword
stained
with
his
blood
and
his
last
farewell
and
said
that
my
curse
had
driven
him
into
battle
and
death
and
despair
charles
turning
away
in
violent
agitation
the
light
breaks
in
upon
me
old
moor
hear
me
on
i
fainted
at
the
dreadful
news
they
must
have
thought
me
dead
for
when
i
recovered
my
senses
i
was
already
in
my
coffin
shrouded
like
a
corpse
i
scratched
against
the
lid
it
was
opened
was
in
the
dead
of
night
my
son
francis
stood
before
me
what
said
he
with
a
tremendous
voice
wilt
thou
then
live
forever
and
with
this
he
the
lid
of
the
coffin
the
thunder
of
these
words
bereft
me
of
my
senses
when
i
awoke
again
i
felt
that
the
coffin
was
in
motion
and
being
borne
on
wheels
at
last
it
was
opened
i
found
myself
at
the
entrance
of
this
dungeon
my
son
stood
before
me
and
the
man
too
who
had
brought
me
the
bloody
sword
from
charles
i
fell
at
my
son
feet
and
ten
times
i
embraced
his
knees
and
wept
and
conjured
and
supplicated
but
the
supplications
of
a
father
reached
not
his
flinty
heart
down
with
the
old
carcass
said
he
with
a
voice
of
thunder
he
has
lived
too
long
and
i
was
thrust
down
without
mercy
and
my
son
francis
closed
the
door
upon
me
charles
impossible
impossible
your
memory
or
senses
deceive
you
old
moor
oh
that
it
were
so
but
hear
me
on
and
restrain
your
rage
there
i
lay
for
twenty
hours
and
not
a
soul
cared
for
my
misery
no
human
footstep
treads
this
solitary
wild
for
is
commonly
believed
that
the
ghosts
of
my
ancestors
drag
clanking
chains
through
these
ruins
and
chant
their
funeral
dirge
at
the
hour
of
midnight
at
last
i
heard
the
door
creak
again
on
its
hinges
this
man
opened
it
and
brought
me
bread
and
water
he
told
me
that
i
had
been
condemned
to
die
of
hunger
and
that
his
life
was
in
danger
should
it
be
discovered
that
he
fed
me
thus
has
my
miserable
existence
been
till
now
sustained
but
the
unceasing
cold
the
foul
air
of
my
filthy
dungeon
my
incurable
grief
have
exhausted
my
strength
and
reduced
my
body
to
a
skeleton
a
thousand
times
have
i
implored
heaven
with
tears
to
put
an
end
to
my
sufferings
but
doubtless
the
measure
of
my
punishment
is
not
fulfilled
or
some
happiness
must
be
yet
in
store
for
me
for
which
he
deigns
thus
miraculously
to
preserve
me
but
i
suffer
justly
my
charles
my
charles
and
before
there
was
even
a
gray
hair
on
his
head
charles
enough
rise
ye
stocks
ye
lumps
of
ice
ye
lazy
unfeeling
sleepers
up
will
none
of
you
awake
he
fires
a
pistol
over
their
heads
the
robbers
starting
up
ho
hallo
hallo
what
is
the
matter
charles
has
not
that
tale
shaken
you
out
of
your
sleep
is
enough
to
break
the
sleep
eternal
see
here
see
here
the
laws
of
the
world
have
become
mere
the
bonds
of
nature
are
burst
asunder
the
demon
of
discord
has
broken
loose
and
stalks
abroad
triumphant
the
son
has
slain
his
father
the
robbers
what
does
the
captain
say
charles
slain
did
i
say
no
that
is
too
mild
a
term
a
son
has
a
broken
his
own
father
on
the
wheel
impaled
racked
flayed
him
alive
but
all
these
words
are
too
feeble
to
express
what
would
make
sin
itself
blush
and
cannibals
shudder
for
ages
no
devil
ever
conceived
a
deed
so
horrible
his
own
father
but
see
see
him
he
has
fainted
away
his
own
father
the
son
into
this
dungeon
cold
naked
hungry
athirst
oh
see
i
pray
you
see
is
my
own
father
in
very
truth
it
is
the
robbers
come
running
and
surround
the
old
man
your
father
yours
schweitzer
approaches
him
reverently
and
falls
on
his
knees
before
him
father
of
my
captain
let
me
kiss
thy
feet
my
dagger
is
at
thy
command
charles

thou
horribly
injured
profaned
old
man
thus
from
this
moment
and
forever
i
rend
in
twain
all
ties
of
fraternity
he
rends
his
garment
from
top
to
bottom
here
in
the
face
of
heaven
i
curse
him
curse
every
drop
of
blood
which
flows
in
his
veins
hear
me
o
moon
and
stars
and
thou
black
canopy
of
night
that
lookest
down
upon
this
horror
hear
me
thrice
terrible
avenger
thou
who
reignest
above
yon
pallid
orb
who
sittest
an
avenger
and
a
judge
above
the
stars
and
dartest
thy
fiery
bolts
through
darkness
on
the
head
of
guilt
behold
me
on
my
knees
behold
me
raise
this
hand
aloft
in
the
gloom
of
night
and
hear
my
oath
and
may
nature
vomit
me
forth
as
some
horrible
abortion
from
out
the
circle
of
her
works
if
i
break
that
oath
here
i
swear
that
i
will
never
more
greet
the
light
of
day
till
the
blood
of
that
foul
parricide
spilt
upon
this
stone
reeks
in
misty
vapor
towards
heaven
he
rises

is
a
deed
of
hell
after
this
who
shall
call
us
villains
no
by
all
the
dragons
of
darkness
we
never
have
done
anything
half
so
horrible
charles
true
and
by
all
the
fearful
groans
of
those
whom
your
daggers
have
despatched
of
those
who
on
that
terrible
day
were
consumed
by
fire
or
crushed
by
the
falling
tower
no
thought
of
murder
or
rapine
shall
be
harbored
in
your
breast
till
every
man
among
you
has
dyed
his
garments
scarlet
in
this
monster
blood
it
never
i
should
think
entered
your
dreams
that
it
would
fall
to
your
lot
to
execute
the
great
decrees
of

the
tangled
web
of
our
destiny

him

has
called
you
to
this
high
destiny

has
conducted
you
hither
and

ye
worthy

his
inscrutable
judgments

a
lock
of
hair
in
his
hand

you
remember
still
how
you
cleft
the
skull
of
that
bohemian
trooper
at
the
moment
his
sabre
was
descending
on
my
head
and
i
had
sunk
down
on
my
knees
breathless
and
exhausted

a
reward

this
hour

never
been
able
to
discharge
that
debt

i
prythee

daniel
and
have
a
good
laugh
at
me
you
must
know
i
fancied
that
i
held
a
princely
banquet
my
heart
was
merry
and
i
lay
stretched
on
the
turf
in
the
castle
garden
and
all
on
a
sudden
it
was
at
midday
and
all
on
a
sudden
but
mind
you
have
a
good
laugh
at
me
daniel
all
on
a
sudden
francis
all
on
a
sudden
a
tremendous
peal
of
thunder
struck
upon
my
slumbering
ear
i
started
up
staggering
and
trembling
and
lo
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
hemisphere
had
burst
forth
in
one
flaming
sheet
of
fire
and
mountains
and
cities
and
forests
melted
away
like
wax
in
the
furnace
and
then
rose
a
howling
whirlwind
which
swept
before
it
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
heaven
then
came
a
sound
as
from
brazen
trumpets
earth
give
up
thy
dead
sea
give
up
thy
dead
and
the
open
plains
began
to
heave
and
to
cast
up
skulls
and
ribs
and
jawbones
and
legs
which
drew
together
into
human
bodies
and
then
came
sweeping
along
in
dense
interminable
masses
a
living
deluge
then
i
looked
up
and
lo
i
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
thundering
sinai
and
above
me
was
a
multitude
and
below
me
a
multitude
and
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
on
three
smoking
thrones
sat
three
men
before
whose
gaze
all
creation
trembled
daniel
why
this
is
a
living
picture
of
the
day
of
judgment
francis
did
i
not
tell
you
is
it
not
ridiculous
stuff
and
one
stepped
forth
who
to
look
upon
was
like
a
starlight
night
he
had
in
his
hand
a
signet
ring
of
iron
which
he
held
up
between
the
east
and
the
west
and
said
eternal
holy
just
immutable
there
is
but
one
truth
there
is
but
one
virtue
woe
woe
woe
to
the
doubting
sinner
then
stepped
forth
a
second
who
had
in
his
hand
a
flashing
mirror
which
he
held
up
between
the
east
and
west
and
said
this
is
the
mirror
of
truth
hypocrisy
and
deceit
can
not
look
on
it
then
was
i
terrified
and
so
were
all
for
we
saw
the
forms
of
snakes
and
tigers
and
leopards
reflected
from
that
fearful
mirror
then
stepped
forth
a
third
who
had
in
his
hand
a
brazen
balance
which
he
held
up
between
the
east
and
the
west
and
said
approach
ye
sons
of
adam
i
weigh
your
thoughts
in
the
balance
of
my
wrath
and
your
deeds
with
the
weight
of
my
fury
daniel
the
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
francis
they
all
stood
pale
and
trembling
and
every
heart
was
panting
with
fearful
expectation
then
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
heard
my
name
called
the
first
from
out
the
thunders
of
the
mountain
and
the
innermost
marrow
froze
within
my
bones
and
my
teeth
chattered
loudly
presently
the
clang
of
the
balance
was
heard
the
rocks
sent
forth
thunders
and
the
hours
glided
by
one
after
the
other
towards
the
left
scale
and
each
threw
into
it
a
mortal
sin
daniel
oh
may
god
forgive
you
francis
he
forgave
me
not
the
left
scale
grew
mountains
high
but
the
other
filled
with
the
blood
of
atonement
still
outweighed
it
at
last
came
an
old
man
heavily
bowed
down
with
grief
his
arm
gnawed
through
with
raging
hunger
every
eye
turned
away
in
horror
from
the
sight
i
knew
the
man
he
cut
off
a
lock
of
his
silver
hair
and
cast
it
into
the
scale
of
my
sins
when
to
in
an
instant
it
sank
down
to
the
abyss
and
the
scale
of
atonement
flew
up
on
high
then
heard
i
a
voice
issuing
like
thunder
from
the
bowels
some
editions
of
the
original
read
rauch
smoke
some
bauch
as
translated
of
the
mountain
pardon
pardon
to
every
sinner
of
the
earth
and
of
the
deep
thou
alone
art
rejected
a
profound
pause
well
why
do
you
laugh
daniel
can
i
laugh
while
my
flesh
creeps
dreams
come
from
above
francis
pshaw
pshaw
say
not
so
call
me
a
fool
an
idiot
an
absurd
fool
do
there
a
good
daniel
i
entreat
of
you
have
a
hearty
laugh
at
me
daniel
dreams
come
from
god
i
will
pray
for
you
francis
thou
liest
i
tell
thee
go
this
instant
run
be
quick
see
where
the
minister
tarries
all
this
time
tell
him
to
come
quickly
instantly
but
i
tell
thee
thou
liest
daniel
heaven
have
mercy
upon
you
exit
francis
vulgar
prejudice
mere
superstition
it
has
not
yet
been
proved
that
the
past
is
not
past
and
forgotten
or
that
there
is
an
eye
above
this
earth
to
take
account
of
what
passes
on
it
humph
humph
but
whence
then
this
fearful
whisper
to
my
soul
is
there
really
an
avenging
judge
above
the
stars
no
no
yes
yes
a
fearful
monitor
within
bears
witness
that
there
is
one
above
the
stars
who
judgeth
what
meet
the
avenger
above
the
stars
this
very
night
no
no
i
say
all
is
empty
lonely
desolate
beyond
the
stars
miserable
subterfuge
beneath
which
thy
cowardice
seeks
to
hide
itself
and
if
there
should
be
something
in
it
after
all
no
no
it
can
not
be
i
insist
that
it
can
not
be
but
yet
if
there
should
be
woe
to
thee
if
thy
sins
should
all
have
been
registered
above
if
they
should
be
counted
over
to
thee
this
very
night
why
creeps
this
shudder
through
my
frame
to
die
why
does
that
word
frighten
me
thus
to
give
an
account
to
the
avenger
there
above
the
stars
and
if
he
should
be
just
the
wails
of
orphans
and
widows
of
the
oppressed
the
tormented
ascending
to
his
ears
and
he
be
just
why
have
they
been
afflicted
and
why
have
i
been
permitted
to
trample
upon
them
enter
pastor
moser
moser
your
lordship
sent
for
me
i
am
surprised
the
first
time
in
my
life
is
it
to
scoff
at
religion
or
does
it
begin
to
make
you
tremble
francis
i
may
scoff
or
i
may
tremble
according
as
you
shall
answer
me
listen
to
me
moser
i
will
prove
that
you
are
a
fool
or
wish
to
make
fools
of
others
and
you
shall
answer
me
do
you
hear
at
the
peril
of
your
life
you
shall
answer
me
moser
is
a
higher
being
whom
you
summon
before
your
tribunal
he
will
answer
you
hereafter
francis
i
will
be
answered
now
this
instant
that
i
may
not
commit
the
contemptible
folly
of
calling
upon
the
idol
of
the
vulgar
under
the
pressure
of
suffering
i
have
often
in
bumpers
of
burgundy
tauntingly
pledged
you
in
the
toast
there
is
no
god
now
i
address
myself
to
you
in
earnest
and
i
tell
you
there
is
none
you
shall
oppose
me
with
all
the
weapons
in
your
power
but
with
the
breath
of
my
lips
i
will
blow
them
away
moser
well
that
you
could
also
blow
away
the
thunder
which
will
alight
upon
your
proud
soul
with
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
weight
that
omniscient
god
whom
you
fool
and
miscreant
are
denying
in
the
midst
of
his
creation
needeth
not
to
justify
himself
by
the
mouth
of
dust
he
is
as
great
in
your
tyrannies
as
in
the
sweetest
smile
of
triumphant
virtue
francis
uncommonly
well
said
parson
thus
i
like
you
moser
i
stand
here
as
steward
of
a
greater
master
and
am
addressing
one
who
like
myself
is
a
sinner
one
whom
i
care
not
to
please
i
must
indeed
be
able
to
work
miracles
to
extort
the
acknowledgment
from
your
obdurate
wickedness
but
if
your
conviction
is
so
firm
why
have
you
sent
for
me
in
the
middle
of
the
night
francis
because
time
hangs
heavy
on
my
hands
and
the
has
ceased
to
have
any
attraction
i
wish
to
amuse
myself
in
a
tilt
with
the
parson
your
empty
terrors
will
not
unman
my
courage
i
am
well
aware
that
those
who
have
come
off
short
in
this
world
look
forward
to
eternity
but
they
will
be
sadly
disappointed
i
have
always
read
that
our
whole
body
is
nothing
more
than
a
and
that
with
its
last
drop
mind
and
thought
dissolve
into
nothing
they
share
all
the
infirmities
of
the
body
why
then
should
they
not
cease
with
its
dissolution
why
not
evaporate
in
its
decomposition
let
a
drop
of
water
stray
into
your
brain
and
life
makes
a
sudden
pause
which
borders
on
and
this
pause
continued
is
death
sensation
is
the
vibration
of
a
few
chords
which
when
the
instrument
is
broken
cease
to
sound
if
i
raze
my
seven
castles
if
i
dash
this
venus
to
pieces
there
is
an
end
of
their
symmetry
and
beauty
behold
thus
is
it
with
your
immortal
soul
moser
so
says
the
philosophy
of
your
despair
but
your
own
heart
which
knocks
against
your
ribs
with
terror
even
while
you
thus
argue
gives
your
tongue
the
lie
these
cobwebs
of
systems
are
swept
away
by
the
single
word
thou
must
die
i
challenge
you
and
be
this
the
test
if
you
maintain
your
firmness
in
the
hour
of
death
if
your
principles
do
not
then
miserably
desert
you
you
shall
be
admitted
to
have
the
best
of
the
argument
but
if
in
that
dread
hour
the
least
shudder
creeps
over
you
then
woe
be
to
you
you
have
deceived
yourself
francis
disturbed
if
in
the
hour
of
death
a
shudder
creeps
over
me
moser
i
have
seen
many
such
wretches
before
now
who
set
truth
at
defiance
up
to
that
point
but
at
the
approach
of
death
the
illusion
vanished
i
will
stand
at
your
bedside
when
you
are
dying
i
should
much
like
to
see
a
tyrant
die
i
will
stand
by
and
look
you
steadfastly
in
the
face
when
the
physician
takes
your
cold
clammy
hand
and
is
scarcely
able
to
detect
your
expiring
pulse
and
when
he
looks
up
and
with
a
fearful
shake
of
the
head
says
to
you
all
human
aid
is
in
vain
beware
at
that
moment
beware
lest
you
look
like
richard
and
nero
francis
no
no
moser
even
that
very
no
will
then
be
turned
to
a
howling
yea
an
inward
tribunal
which
you
can
no
longer
cheat
with
sceptical
delusions
will
then
wake
up
and
pass
judgment
upon
you
but
the
waking
up
will
be
like
that
of
one
buried
alive
in
the
bowels
of
the
churchyard
there
will
come
remorse
like
that
of
the
suicide
who
has
committed
the
fatal
act
and
repents
it
be
a
flash
of
lightning
suddenly
breaking
in
upon
the
midnight
darkness
of
your
life
there
will
be
one
look
and
if
you
can
sustain
that
i
will
admit
that
you
have
won
francis
walking
up
and
down
restlessly
cant
priestly
cant
moser
then
for
the
first
time
will
the
sword
of
eternity
pass
through
your
soul
and
then
for
the
first
time
too
late
the
thought
of
god
will
wake
up
a
terrible
monitor
whose
name
is
judge
mark
this
moor
a
thousand
lives
hang
upon
your
beck
and
of
those
thousand
every
nine
hundred
and
have
been
rendered
miserable
by
you
you
wanted
but
the
roman
empire
to
be
a
nero
the
kingdom
of
peru
to
be
a
pizarro
now
do
you
really
think
that
the
almighty
will
suffer
a
worm
like
you
to
play
the
tyrant
in
his
world
and
to
reverse
all
his
ordinances
do
you
think
the
nine
hundred
and
were
created
only
to
be
destroyed
only
to
serve
as
puppets
in
your
diabolical
game
think
it
not
he
will
call
you
to
account
for
every
minute
of
which
you
have
robbed
them
every
joy
that
you
have
poisoned
every
perfection
that
you
have
intercepted
then
if
you
can
answer
him
then
moor
i
will
admit
that
you
have
won
francis
no
more
not
another
word
am
i
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
thy
drivelling
fancies
moser
beware
the
different
destinies
of
mankind
are
balanced
with
terrible
nicety
the
scale
of
life
which
sinks
here
will
rise
there
and
that
which
rises
here
will
sink
there
what
was
here
temporary
affliction
will
there
be
eternal
triumph
and
what
here
was
temporary
triumph
will
there
be
eternal
despair
francis
rushing
savagely
upon
him
may
the
thunder
of
heaven
strike
thee
dumb
thou
lying
spirit
i
will
tear
thy
venomed
tongue
out
of
thy
mouth
moser
do
you
so
soon
feel
the
weight
of
truth
before
i
have
brought
forward
one
single
word
of
evidence
let
me
first
proceed
to
the
proofs
francis
silence
to
hell
with
thee
and
thy
proofs
the
soul
is
annihilated
i
tell
thee
and
i
will
not
be
gainsaid
moser
that
is
what
the
spirits
of
the
bottomless
pit
are
hourly
moaning
for
but
heaven
denies
the
boon
do
you
hope
to
escape
from
the
avenger
arm
even
in
the
solitary
waste
of
nothingness
if
you
climb
up
into
heaven
he
is
there
if
you
make
your
bed
in
hell
behold
he
is
there
also
if
you
say
to
the
night
hide
me
and
to
the
darkness
cover
me
even
the
night
shall
be
light
about
you
and
darkness
blaze
upon
your
damned
soul
like
a
noonday
sun
francis
but
i
do
not
wish
to
be
immortal
let
them
be
so
that
like
i
have
no
desire
to
hinder
them
i
will
force
him
to
annihilate
me
i
will
so
provoke
his
fury
that
he
may
utterly
destroy
me
tell
me
which
are
the
greatest
sins
which
excite
him
to
the
most
terrible
wrath
moser
i
know
but
two
but
men
do
not
commit
these
nor
do
men
even
dream
of
them
francis
what
are
they
moser
very
significantly
parricide
is
the
name
of
the
one
fratricide
of
the
other
why
do
you
turn
so
suddenly
pale
francis
what
old
man

in
league
with
heaven
or
with
hell
who
told
thee
that
moser
woe
to

soul

better
for

man

at
peace

no
longer

a
father
or

eleven
living

thousand

oh
fool
that
i
was
to
fancy
that
i
could
amend
the
world
by
misdeeds
and
maintain

by
lawlessness
i
called
it
vengeance
and
equity

presumed
o
providence
upon
whetting
out
the
notches
of
thy
sword
and
repairing
thy
partialities
but
oh
vain
trifling
here
i
stand
on
the
brink
of
a
fearful
life
and
learn
with
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
that
two
men
like
myself
could
ruin
the
whole
edifice
of
the
moral
world
pardon
pardon
the
boy
who
thought
to
forestall
thee
to
thee
alone
belongeth
vengeance
thou
needest
not
the
hand
of
man
but
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
recall
the
past
that
which
is
ruined
remains
ruined
what
i
have
thrown
down
will
never
more
rise
up
again
yet
one
thing
is
left
me
whereby
i
may
atone
to
the
offended
majesty
of
the
law
and
restore
the
order
which
i
have
violated
a
victim
is
required
a
victim
to
declare
before
all
mankind
how
inviolable
that
majesty
is
that
victim

be
myself

will
be
the

his
sword
from
him

will
kill
himself

fools
that
ye
are
doomed

ye
that
one
mortal
sin
will
expiate
other
mortal
sins
do
you
suppose
that
the
harmony
of
the
world
would
be
promoted
by
such
an
impious
discord
throwing
his
arms
at

shall

me
alive

go
to
deliver
myself
into
the
hands
of
justice
robbers
put
him
in
chains
he
has
lost
his
senses
charles
not
that
i
have
any
doubt
but
that
justice
would
find
me
speedily
enough
if
the
powers
above
so
ordained
it
but
she
might
surprise
me
in
sleep
or
overtake
me
in
flight
or
seize
me
with
violence
and
the
sword
and
then
i
should
have
lost
the
only
merit
left
me
that
of
making
my
death
a
atonement
why
should
i
like
a
thief
any
longer
conceal
a
life
which
in
the
counsels
of
the
heavenly
ministry
has
long
been
forfeited
