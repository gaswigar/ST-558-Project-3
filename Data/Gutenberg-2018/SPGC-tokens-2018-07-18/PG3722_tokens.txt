take
the
wings
of
morning
kate
bates
followed
the
narrow
footpath
rounding
the
corner
of
the
small
country
church
as
the
old
minister
raised
his
voice
slowly
and
impressively
to
repeat
the
command
he
had
selected
for
his
text
fearing
that
her
head
would
be
level
with
the
windows
she
bent
and
walked
swiftly
past
the
church
but
the
words
went
with
her
iterating
and
reiterating
themselves
in
her
brain
once
she
paused
to
glance
back
toward
the
church
wondering
what
the
minister
would
say
in
expounding
that
text
she
had
a
fleeting
thought
of
slipping
in
taking
the
back
seat
and
listening
to
the
sermon
the
remembrance
that
she
had
not
dressed
for
church
deterred
her
then
her
face
twisted
grimly
as
she
again
turned
to
the
path
for
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
nothing
else
to
wear
if
she
had
started
to
attend
church
instead
of
going
to
see
her
brother
as
usual
she
had
left
her
bed
at
four
for
seven
hours
she
had
cooked
washed
dishes
made
beds
swept
dusted
milked
churned
following
the
usual
routine
of
a
big
family
in
the
country
then
she
had
gone
upstairs
dressed
in
clean
gingham
and
confronted
her
mother
i
think
i
have
done
my
share
for
she
said
suppose
you
call
on
our
lady
for
help
with
dinner
i
going
to
adam
bates
lifted
her
gaunt
form
to
very
close
six
feet
of
height
looking
narrowly
at
her
daughter
well
what
the
nation
are
you
going
to
adam
at
this
time
for
she
demanded
oh
i
have
a
curiosity
to
learn
if
there
is
one
of
the
eighteen
members
of
this
family
who
gives
a
cent
what
becomes
of
me
answered
kate
her
eyes
meeting
and
looking
clearly
into
her
mother
you
are
not
letting
yourself
think
he
would
a
cent
to
send
you
to
that
fool
are
you
i
am
not
but
it
was
a
thing
when
mary
and
nancy
ellen
and
the
older
girls
wanted
to
go
you
even
let
mary
go
to
college
two
years
mary
had
exceptional
ability
said
bates
i
wonder
how
she
convinced
you
of
it
none
of
the
rest
of
us
can
discover
it
said
kate
what
you
need
is
a
good
strapping
miss
i
know
it
but
considering
the
facts
that
i
am
larger
than
you
and
was
eighteen
in
september
i
should
advise
you
to
attempt
it
what
is
the
difference
whether
i
was
born
in
or
give
me
the
chance
you
gave
mary
and
i
prove
to
you
that
i
can
do
anything
she
has
done
without
having
ability
the
difference
is
that
i
am
past
sixty
now
i
was
stout
as
an
ox
when
mary
wanted
to
go
to
school
it
is
your
duty
and
your
job
to
stay
here
and
do
this
work
to
pay
for
having
been
born
last
not
a
bit
more
than
if
i
had
been
born
first
any
girl
in
the
family
owes
you
as
much
for
life
as
i
do
it
is
up
to
the
others
to
pay
back
in
service
after
they
are
of
age
if
it
is
to
me
i
have
done
my
share
if
father
were
not
the
richest
farmer
in
the
county
and
one
of
the
richest
men
it
would
be
different
he
can
afford
to
hire
help
for
you
quite
as
well
as
he
can
for
himself
hire
help
who
would
i
get
to
do
the
work
here
you
have
to
double
your
assistants
you
could
not
hire
two
women
who
would
come
here
and
do
so
much
work
as
i
do
in
a
day
that
is
why
i
decline
to
give
up
teaching
and
stay
here
to
slave
at
your
option
for
gingham
dresses
and
cowhide
shoes
of
your
selection
if
i
were
a
boy
i
work
three
years
more
and
then
i
would
be
given
two
hundred
acres
of
land
have
a
house
and
barn
built
for
me
and
a
start
of
stock
given
me
as
every
boy
in
this
family
has
had
at
a
man
is
a
man
he
founds
a
family
he
runs
the
government
it
is
a
different
matter
said
bates
it
surely
is
in
this
family
but
i
think
even
with
us
a
man
would
have
rather
a
difficult
proposition
on
his
hands
to
found
a
family
without
a
woman
or
to
run
the
government
either
all
right
go
on
to
adam
and
see
what
you
get
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
nancy
ellen
gets
dinner
anyway
said
kate
as
she
passed
through
the
door
and
followed
the
long
path
to
the
gate
from
there
walking
beside
the
road
in
the
direction
of
her
brother
home
there
were
many
horses
in
the
pasture
and
single
and
double
buggies
in
the
barn
but
it
never
occurred
to
kate
that
she
might
ride
it
was
sunday
and
the
horses
were
resting
so
she
followed
the
path
beside
the
fences
rounded
the
corner
of
the
church
and
went
on
her
way
with
the
text
from
which
the
pastor
was
preaching
hammering
in
her
brain
she
became
so
absorbed
in
thought
that
she
scarcely
saw
the
footpath
she
followed
while
june
flowered
and
perfumed
and
sang
all
around
her
she
was
so
intent
upon
the
words
she
had
heard
that
her
feet
unconsciously
followed
a
branch
from
the
main
path
leading
into
the
woods
from
the
bridge
where
she
sat
on
a
log
and
for
the
unnumbered
time
reviewed
her
problem
she
had
worked
ever
since
she
could
remember
never
in
her
life
had
she
gotten
to
school
before
noon
on
monday
because
of
the
large
washings
after
the
other
work
was
finished
she
had
spent
nights
and
mornings
ironing
when
she
longed
to
study
seldom
finishing
before
saturday
summer
brought
an
endless
round
of
harvesting
canning
drying
winter
brought
butchering
heaps
of
sewing
and
postponed
summer
work
school
began
late
in
the
fall
and
closed
early
in
spring
with
teachers
often
inefficient
yet
because
she
was
a
close
student
and
kept
her
books
where
she
could
take
a
peep
and
memorize
and
think
as
she
washed
dishes
and
cooked
she
had
thoroughly
mastered
all
the
country
school
near
her
home
could
teach
her
with
six
weeks
of
a
summer
normal
course
she
would
be
as
well
prepared
to
teach
as
any
of
her
sisters
were
with
the
exception
of
mary
who
had
been
able
to
convince
her
parents
that
she
possessed
two
college
years
worth
of
ability
kate
laid
no
claim
to
ability
herself
but
she
knew
she
was
as
strong
as
most
men
had
an
ordinary
brain
that
could
be
trained
and
while
she
was
far
from
beautiful
she
was
equally
as
far
from
being
ugly
for
her
skin
was
smooth
and
pink
her
eyes
large
and
her
teeth
even
and
white
she
missed
beauty
because
her
cheekbones
were
high
her
mouth
large
her
nose
barely
escaping
a
pug
but
she
had
a
real
crown
of
glory
in
her
hair
which
was
silken
fine
long
and
heavy
of
in
colour
curling
naturally
around
her
face
and
neck
given
pure
blood
to
paint
such
a
skin
with
varying
emotions
enough
wind
to
ravel
out
a
few
locks
of
such
hair
the
proportions
of
a
venus
and
perfect
health
any
girl
could
rest
very
well
assured
of
being
looked
at
twice
if
not
oftener
kate
sat
on
a
log
a
most
unusual
occurrence
for
her
for
she
was
familiar
only
with
bare
hot
houses
furnished
with
meagre
necessities
reeking
stables
barnyards
and
vegetable
gardens
she
knew
less
of
the
woods
than
the
average
city
girl
but
there
was
a
soothing
wind
a
sweet
perfume
a
calming
silence
that
quieted
her
tense
mood
and
enabled
her
to
think
clearly
so
the
review
went
on
over
years
of
work
and
petty
economies
amounting
to
one
grand
aggregate
that
gave
to
each
of
seven
sons
house
stock
and
land
at
and
to
each
of
nine
daughters
a
bolt
of
muslin
and
a
fairly
decent
dress
when
she
married
as
the
seven
older
ones
did
speedily
for
they
were
fine
large
upstanding
girls
some
having
real
beauty
all
exceptionally
economists
and
workers
because
her
mother
had
the
younger
daughters
to
help
in
the
absence
of
the
elder
each
girl
had
been
allowed
the
time
and
money
to
prepare
herself
to
teach
a
country
school
all
of
them
had
taught
until
they
married
nancy
ellen
the
beauty
of
the
family
the
girl
next
older
than
kate
had
taken
the
home
school
for
the
second
winter
going
to
school
to
nancy
ellen
had
been
the
greatest
trial
of
kate
life
until
the
possibility
of
not
going
to
normal
had
confronted
her
nancy
ellen
was
almost
as
large
as
kate
quite
as
pink
her
features
assembled
in
a
manner
that
made
all
the
difference
her
hair
as
curly
as
kate
her
eyes
big
and
dark
her
lips
red
as
for
looking
at
kate
twice
no
one
ever
looked
at
her
at
all
if
nancy
ellen
happened
to
be
walking
beside
her
kate
bore
that
without
protest
it
would
have
wounded
her
pride
to
rebel
openly
she
did
nancy
share
of
the
work
to
allow
her
to
study
and
have
her
normal
course
she
remained
at
home
plainly
clothed
to
loan
nancy
ellen
her
best
dress
when
she
attended
normal
but
when
she
found
that
she
was
doomed
to
finish
her
last
year
at
school
under
nancy
ellen
to
work
double
so
that
her
sister
might
go
to
school
early
and
remain
late
coming
home
tired
and
with
lessons
to
prepare
for
the
morrow
some
of
the
spontaneity
left
kate
efforts
she
had
a
worse
grievance
when
nancy
ellen
hung
several
new
dresses
and
a
wrapper
on
her
side
of
the
closet
after
her
first
and
furnished
her
end
of
the
bureau
with
a
white
hair
brush
and
a
brass
box
filled
with
pink
powder
with
a
puff
for
its
application
for
three
months
kate
had
waited
and
hoped
that
at
least
thank
you
would
be
vouchsafed
her
when
it
failed
for
that
length
of
time
she
did
two
things
she
studied
so
diligently
that
her
father
called
her
into
the
barn
and
told
her
that
if
before
the
school
she
asked
nancy
ellen
another
question
she
could
not
answer
he
would
use
the
buggy
whip
on
her
to
within
an
inch
of
her
life
the
buggy
whip
always
had
been
a
familiar
implement
to
kate
so
she
stopped
asking
slippery
questions
worked
harder
than
ever
and
spent
her
spare
time
planning
what
she
would
hang
in
the
closet
and
put
on
her
end
of
the
bureau
when
she
had
finished
her
normal
course
and
was
teaching
her
first
term
of
school
now
she
had
learned
all
that
nancy
ellen
could
teach
her
and
much
that
nancy
ellen
never
knew
it
was
time
for
kate
to
be
starting
away
to
school
because
it
was
so
that
she
should
have
what
the
others
had
had
she
said
nothing
about
it
until
the
time
came
then
she
found
her
father
determined
that
she
should
remain
at
home
to
do
the
housework
for
no
compensation
other
than
her
board
and
such
clothes
as
she
always
had
worn
her
mother
wholly
in
accord
with
him
and
marvel
of
all
nancy
ellen
quite
enthusiastic
on
the
subject
her
father
always
had
driven
himself
and
his
family
like
slaves
while
her
mother
had
ably
seconded
his
efforts
money
from
the
sale
of
chickens
turkeys
butter
eggs
and
garden
truck
that
other
women
of
the
neighbourhood
used
for
extra
clothing
for
themselves
and
their
daughters
and
to
prettify
their
homes
bates
handed
to
her
husband
to
increase
the
amount
necessary
to
purchase
the
two
hundred
acres
of
land
for
each
son
when
he
came
of
age
the
youngest
son
had
farmed
his
land
with
comfortable
profit
and
started
a
bank
account
while
his
parents
and
two
sisters
were
still
saving
and
working
to
finish
the
last
payment
kate
thought
with
bitterness
that
if
this
final
payment
had
been
made
possibly
there
would
have
been
money
to
spare
for
her
but
with
that
thought
came
the
knowledge
that
her
father
had
numerous
investments
on
which
he
could
have
realized
and
made
the
payments
had
he
not
preferred
that
they
should
be
a
burden
on
his
family
take
the
wings
of
morning
repeated
kate
with
all
the
emphasis
the
old
minister
had
used
hummm
i
wonder
what
kind
of
wings
those
of
a
peewee
would
scarcely
do
for
me
i
need
the
wings
of
an
eagle
to
get
me
anywhere
and
anyway
it
was
the
wings
of
a
bird
i
was
to
take
it
was
the
wings
of
morning
i
wonder
what
the
wings
of
morning
are
and
how
i
go
about
taking
them
god
knows
where
my
wings
come
in
by
the
ache
in
my
feet
i
seem
to
have
walked
mostly
oh
what
are
the
wings
of
morning
kate
stared
straight
before
her
sitting
absorbed
and
motionless
close
in
front
of
her
a
little
white
moth
fluttered
over
the
twigs
and
grasses
a
kingbird
sailed
into
view
and
perched
on
a
preparatory
to
darting
after
the
moth
while
the
bird
measured
the
distance
and
waited
for
the
moth
to
rise
above
the
entangling
grasses
with
a
sweep
and
a
snap
a
smaller
bird
very
similar
in
shape
and
colouring
flashed
down
catching
the
moth
and
flying
high
among
the
branches
of
a
big
tree
aha
you
missed
your
opportunity
said
kate
to
the
kingbird
she
sat
straighter
suddenly
opportunity
she
repeated
here
is
where
i
am
threatened
with
missing
mine
opportunity
i
wonder
now
if
that
might
not
be
another
name
for
wings
of
morning
morning
is
winging
its
way
past
me
the
question
is
do
i
sit
still
and
let
it
pass
or
do
i
take
its
wings
and
fly
away
kate
brooded
on
that
awhile
then
her
thought
formulated
into
words
again
it
is
as
if
mother
were
sick
or
poor
she
is
perfectly
well
and
stronger
than
nine
women
out
of
ten
of
her
age
father
can
afford
to
hire
all
the
help
she
needs
there
is
nothing
cruel
or
unkind
in
leaving
her
and
as
for
nancy
ellen
why
does
the
fact
that
i
am
a
few
years
younger
than
she
make
me
her
servant
why
do
i
cook
for
her
and
make
her
bed
and
wash
her
clothes
while
she
earns
money
to
spend
on
herself
and
she
is
doing
everything
in
her
power
to
keep
me
at
it
because
she
likes
what
she
is
doing
and
what
it
brings
her
and
she
does
give
a
tinker
whether
i
like
what
i
am
doing
or
not
or
whether
i
get
anything
i
want
out
of
it
or
not
or
whether
i
miss
getting
off
to
normal
on
time
or
not
she
is
blame
selfish
that
what
she
is
so
she
wo
like
the
jolt
she
going
to
get
but
it
will
benefit
her
soul
her
soul
that
her
pretty
face
keeps
her
from
developing
so
i
shall
give
her
a
little
valuable
assistance
mother
will
be
furious
and
father
will
have
the
buggy
whip
convenient
but
i
am
going
i
do
know
how
or
when
but
i
am
going
who
has
a
thirst
for
knowledge
in
helicon
may
slake
it
if
he
has
still
the
roman

find
a
way
or

kate
arose
tall
and
straight
and
addressed
the
surrounding
woods
now
you
just
watch
me
a
way
or
make
it
she
said
i

curves
and
circles

i
much
to
do
to
get
ready
i
fly
kate
walked
back
to
the
highway
but
instead
of
going
on
she
turned
toward
home
when
she
reached
the
gate
she
saw
nancy
ellen
dressed
her
prettiest
sitting
beneath
a
cherry
tree
reading
a
book
in
very
plain
view
from
the
road
as
kate
came
up
the
path
hello
said
nancy
ellen
was
adam

home

kate

sunday

switched
cried
nancy
ellen
pity
you
were
oftener
when
you
most
needed
it
said
kate
passing
up
the
walk
and
entering
the
door
her
mother
asked
the
same
questions
so
kate
answered
them
well
i
am
glad
you
came
home
said
bates
there
was
no
use
tagging
to
adam
with
a
sorry
story
when
your
father
said
flatly
that
you
could
go
but
i
must
go
urged
kate
i
have
as
good
a
right
to
my
chance
as
the
others
if
you
put
your
foot
down
and
say
so
mother
father
will
let
me
go
why
should
i
have
the
same
chance
as
nancy
ellen
please
mother
let
me
go
you
stay
right
where
you
are
there
is
an
awful
summer
work
before

said
bates
there
always
is
answered
kate
but
now
is
just
my
chance
while
you
have
nancy
ellen
here
to
help
you
she
has
some
special
studying
to
do
and
you
very
well
know
that
she
has
to
attend
the
county
institute
and
take
the
summer
course
of
training
for
teachers
so
do
i
said
kate
stubbornly
you
really
will
not
help
me
mother
i
said
my
say
your
place
is
here
here
you
stay
answered
her
mother
all
right
said
kate
i
cross
you
off
the
docket
of
my
hopes
and
try
father
well
i
warn
you
you
had
better
not
he
has
been
nagged
until
his
patience
is
lost
said
bates
kate
closed
her
lips
and
started
in
search
of
her
father
she
found
him
leaning
on
the
pig
pen
watching
pigs
grow
into
money
one
of
his
most
favoured
occupations
he
scowled
at
her
drawing
his
huge
frame
to
full
height
i
do
want
to
hear
a
word
you
have
to
say
he
said
you
are
the
youngest
and
your
place
is
in
the
kitchen
helping
your
mother
we
have
got
the
last
installment
to
pay
on
hiram
land
this
summer
march
back
to
the
house
and
busy
yourself
with
something
useful
kate
looked
at
him
from
his
face
to
his
heavy
shoes
then
turned
without
a
word
and
went
back
toward
the
house
she
went
around
it
to
the
cherry
tree
and
with
no
preliminaries
said
to
her
sister
nancy
ellen
i
want
you
to
lend
me
enough
money
to
fix
my
clothes
a
little
and
pay
my
way
to
normal
this
summer
i
can
pay
it
all
back
this
winter
i
pay
every
cent
with
interest
before
i
spend
any
on
anything
else
why
you
must
be
crazy
said
nancy
ellen
would
i
be
any
crazier
than
you
when
you
wanted
to
go
asked
kate
but
you
were
here
to
help
mother
said
nancy
ellen
and
you
are
here
to
help
her
now
persisted
kate
but
i
got
to
fix
up
my
clothes
for
the
county
institute
said
nancy
ellen
i
be
gone
most
of
the
summer
i
have
just
as
much
right
to
go
as
you
had
said
kate
father
and
mother
both
say
you
shall
not
go
answered
her
sister
i
suppose
there
is
no
use
to
remind
you
that
i
did
all
in
my
power
to
help
you
to
your
chance
you
did
no
more
than
you
should
have
done
said
nancy
ellen
and
this
is
no
more
than
you
should
do
for
me
in
the
circumstances
said
kate
you
very
well
know
i
ca
father
and
mother
would
turn
me
out
of
the
house
said
nancy
ellen
i
be
only
too
glad
if
they
would
turn
me
out
said
kate
you
can
let
me
have
the
money
if
you
like
mother
would
do
anything
but
talk
and
father
would
not
strike
you
or
make
you
go
he
always
favours
you
he
does
nothing
of
the
sort
i
ca
and
i
wo
so
there
cried
nancy
ellen
is
the
real
answer
there
said
kate
she
went
into
the
cellar
and
ate
some
cold
food
from
the
cupboard
and
drank
a
cup
of
milk
then
she
went
to
her
room
and
looked
over
all
of
her
scanty
stock
of
clothing
laying
in
a
heap
the
pieces
that
needed
mending
she
took
the
clothes
basket
to
the
wash
room
which
was
the
front
of
the
woodhouse
in
summer
built
a
fire
heated
water
and
while
making
it
appear
that
she
was
putting
the
clothes
to
soak
as
usual
she
washed
everything
she
had
that
was
fit
to
use
hanging
the
pieces
to
dry
in
the
building
watch
me
fly
muttered
kate
i
do
seem
to
be
cutting
those
curves
so
very
fast
but
i
moving
i
believe
now
having
exhausted
all
home
resources
that
adam
is
my
next
objective
he
is
the
only
one
in
the
family
who
ever
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
me
maybe
he
cares
a
trifle
what
becomes
of
me
but
oh
how
i
dread
agatha
however
watch
me
take
wing
if
adam
fails
me
i
have
six
remaining
prospects
among
my
loving
brothers
and
if
none
of
them
has
any
feeling
for
me
or
faith
in
me
there
yet
remain
my
seven
dear
before
i
appeal
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
neighbours
but
how
i
dread
agatha
yet
i
fly
chapter
ii
an
embryo
mind
reader
kate
was
far
from
physical
flight
as
she
pounded
the
indignation
of
her
soul
into
the
path
with
her
substantial
feet
baffled
and
angry
she
kept
reviewing
the
situation
as
she
went
swiftly
on
her
way
regardless
of
dust
and
heat
she
could
see
no
justice
in
being
forced
into
a
position
that
promised
to
end
in
further
humiliation
and
defeat
of
her
hopes
if
she
only
could
find
adam
at
the
stable
as
she
passed
and
talk
with
him
alone
secretly
she
well
knew
that
the
chief
source
of
her
dread
of
meeting
her
was
that
to
her
agatha
was
so
funny
that
ridiculing
her
had
been
regarded
as
perfectly
legitimate
pastime
for
agatha
was
funny
but
she
had
no
idea
of
it
and
could
no
more
avoid
it
than
a
bee
could
avoid
being
buzzy
so
the
manner
in
which
her
imitated
her
and
laughed
at
her
none
too
secretly
was
far
from
kind
while
she
never
guessed
what
was
going
on
she
realized
the
antagonism
in
their
attitude
and
stoutly
resented
it
adam
was
his
father
favourite
son
a
stalwart
big
man
silent
honest
and
forceful
the
son
most
after
the
desires
of
the
father
heart
yet
adam
was
the
one
son
of
the
seven
who
had
ignored
his
father
law
that
all
of
his
boys
were
to
marry
strong
healthy
young
women
poor
women
working
women
each
of
the
others
at
coming
of
age
had
contracted
this
prescribed
marriage
as
speedily
as
possible
first
asking
father
bates
the
girl
afterward
if
father
bates
disapproved
the
girl
was
never
asked
at
all
and
the
reason
for
this
docility
on
the
part
of
these
big
matured
men
lay
wholly
in
the
methods
of
father
bates
he
gave
those
two
hundred
acres
of
land
to
each
of
them
on
coming
of
age
and
the
same
sum
to
each
for
the
building
of
a
house
and
barn
and
the
purchase
of
stock
gave
it
to
them
in
words
and
with
the
fullest
assurance
that
it
was
theirs
to
improve
to
live
on
to
add
to
each
of
them
had
seen
and
handled
his
deed
each
had
to
admit
he
never
had
known
his
father
to
tell
a
lie
or
deviate
the
least
from
fairness
in
a
deal
of
any
kind
each
had
been
compelled
to
go
in
the
way
indicated
by
his
father
for
years
but
not
a
man
of
them
held
his
own
deed
these
precious
bits
of
paper
remained
locked
in
the
big
wooden
chest
beside
the
father
bed
while
the
land
stood
on
the
records
in
his
name
the
taxes
they
paid
him
each
year
he
himself
carried
to
the
county
clerk
so
that
he
was
the
largest
landholder
in
the
county
and
one
of
the
very
richest
men
it
must
have
been
extreme
unction
to
his
soul
to
enter
the
county
office
and
ask
for
the
assessment
on
those
little
parcels
of
land
of
mine
men
treated
him
very
deferentially
and
so
did
his
sons
those
documents
carefully
locked
away
had
the
effect
of
obtaining
help
to
harvest
his
hay
and
wheat
whenever
he
desired
to
make
his
least
wish
quickly
deferred
to
to
give
him
authority
and
the
power
for
which
he
lived
and
worked
earlier
later
and
harder
than
any
other
man
of
his
day
and
locality
adam
was
like
him
as
possible
up
to
the
time
he
married
yet
adam
was
the
only
one
of
his
sons
who
disobeyed
him
but
there
was
a
redeeming
feature
adam
married
a
slender
tall
slip
of
a
woman
four
years
his
senior
who
had
been
teaching
in
the
hartley
schools
when
he
began
courting
her
she
was
a
prim
fussy
woman
born
of
a
prim
father
and
a
fussy
mother
so
what
was
to
be
expected
her
face
was
narrow
and
set
her
body
and
her
movements
almost
rigid
her
hair
always
parted
lifted
from
each
side
and
tied
on
the
crown
fell
in
stiff
little
curls
the
back
part
hanging
free
her
speech
as
precise
as
her
movements
was
formed
into
set
habit
through
long
study
of
the
dictionary
she
was
born
antagonistic
to
whatever
existed
no
matter
what
it
was
so
surely
as
every
other
woman
agreed
on
a
dress
a
recipe
a
house
anything
whatever
so
surely
agatha
thought
out
and
followed
a
different
method
the
disconcerting
thing
about
her
being
that
she
usually
finished
any
undertaking
with
less
exertion
ahead
of
time
and
having
saved
considerable
money
she
could
have
written
a
fine
book
of
synonyms
for
as
certainly
as
any
one
said
anything
in
her
presence
that
she
had
occasion
to
repeat
she
changed
the
wording
to
mouthfuls
delivered
with
ponderous
circumlocution
she
subscribed
to
papers
and
magazines
which
she
read
and
remembered
and
she
danced
when
other
women
thought
even
a
waltz
immoral
and
shocking
perfectly
stiff
her
curls
exactly
in
place
agatha
could
be
seen
and
frequently
was
seen
waltzing
on
the
front
porch
in
the
arms
of
and
to
a
tune
whistled
by
young
adam
whose
full
name
was
adam
alcibiades
bates
in
his
younger
days
when
discipline
had
been
required
kate
once
had
heard
her
say
to
the
little
fellow
adam
alcibiades
ascend
these
steps
and
proceed
immediately
to
your
maternal
ancestor
kate
thought
of
this
with
a
dry
smile
as
she
plodded
on
toward
home
hoping
she
could
see
her
brother
at
the
barn
but
she
knew
that
most
probably
she
would
ascend
the
steps
and
proceed
to
the
maternal
ancestor
of
adam
bates
then
she
would
be
forced
to
explain
her
visit
and
combat
both
adam
and
his
wife
for
agatha
was
not
a
nonentity
like
her
collection
of
healthful
agatha
worked
if
she
chose
and
she
did
not
work
if
she
did
not
choose
mostly
she
worked
and
worked
harder
than
any
one
ever
thought
she
had
a
habit
of
keeping
her
house
always
immaculate
finishing
her
cleaning
very
early
and
then
reading
in
a
conspicuous
spot
on
the
veranda
when
other
women
were
busy
with
their
most
tiresome
tasks
such
was
agatha
whom
kate
dreaded
meeting
with
every
reason
for
agatha
despite
curls
bony
structure
language
and
dance
was
the
most
powerful
factor
in
the
whole
bates
family
with
her
and
all
because
when
he
purchased
the
original
two
hundred
acres
for
adam
and
made
the
first
allowance
for
buildings
and
stock
agatha
slipped
the
money
from
adam
fingers
in
some
inexplainable
way
and
spent
it
all
for
stock
because
forsooth
agatha
was
an
only
child
and
her
prim
father
endowed
her
she
said
so
herself
with
three
hundred
acres
of
land
better
in
location
and
more
fertile
than
that
given
to
adam
land
having
on
it
a
roomy
and
comfortable
brick
house
completely
furnished
a
large
barn
and
also
stock
so
that
her
place
could
be
used
to
live
on
and
farm
while
adam
could
be
given
over
to
grazing
herds
of
cattle
which
he
bought
cheaply
fattened
and
sold
at
the
top
of
the
market
if
each
had
brought
such
a
farm
into
the
family
with
her
father
bates
could
have
endured
six
more
prim
angular
becurled
very
well
indeed
for
land
was
his
one
and
only
god
his
respect
for
agatha
was
markedly
very
high
for
in
addition
to
her
farm
he
secretly
admired
her
independence
of
thought
and
action
and
was
amazed
by
the
fact
that
she
was
about
her
work
when
several
of
the
blooming
girls
he
had
selected
for
wives
for
his
sons
were
confined
to
the
sofa
with
a
pain
while
not
one
of
them
schemed
planned
connived
with
her
husband
and
piled
up
the
money
as
agatha
did
therefore
she
stood
at
the
head
of
the
women
of
the
bates
family
while
she
was
considered
to
have
worked
miracles
in
the
heart
of
adam
bates
for
with
his
exception
no
man
of
the
family
ever
had
been
seen
to
touch
a
woman
either
publicly
or
privately
to
offer
the
slightest
form
of
endearment
assistance
or
courtesy
women
are
to
work
and
to
bear
children
said
the
elder
bates
put
them
at
the
first
job
when
they
are
born
and
at
the
second
at
eighteen
and
keep
them
hard
at
it
at
their
rate
of
progression
several
of
the
bates
sons
and
daughters
would
produce
families
that
with
a
couple
of
pairs
of
twins
would
equal
the
sixteen
of
the
elder
bates
but
not
so
agatha
she
had
one
son
of
fifteen
and
one
daughter
of
ten
and
she
said
that
was
all
she
intended
to
have
certainly
it
was
all
she
did
have
but
she
further
aggravated
matters
by
announcing
that
she
had
had
them
because
she
wanted
them
at
such
times
as
she
intended
to
and
that
she
had
the
boy
first
and
five
years
the
older
so
that
he
could
look
after
his
sister
when
they
went
into
company
also
she
walked
up
and
sat
upon
lap
whenever
she
chose
ruffled
his
hair
pulled
his
ears
and
kissed
him
squarely
on
the
mouth
with
every
appearance
of
having
help
while
the
dance
on
the
front
porch
with
her
son
or
daughter
was
of
daily
occurrence
and
anything
funnier
than
agatha
prim
and
angular
with
never
a
hair
out
of
place
stiffly
hopping
money
musk
and
turkey
in
the
straw
or
the
blue
danube
waltz
anything
funnier
than
that
never
happened
but
the
two
adams
and
watched
with
reverent
and
adoring
eyes
for
she
was
mother
and
no
one
else
on
earth
rested
so
high
in
their
respect
as
the
inflexible
woman
they
lived
with
that
she
was
different
from
all
the
other
women
of
her
time
and
location
was
hard
on
the
other
women
had
they
been
exactly
right
they
would
have
been
exactly
like
her
so
kate
thinking
all
these
things
over
her
own
problem
acutely
advanced
and
proceeded
she
advanced
past
the
closed
barn
and
stock
in
the
pasture
past
the
garden
flaming
june
past
the
dooryard
up
the
steps
down
the
hall
into
the
screened
back
porch
dining
room
and
proceeded
to
take
a
chair
while
the
family
finished
the
sunday
night
supper
at
which
they
were
seated
kate
was
not
hungry
and
she
did
not
wish
to
trouble
her
to
set
another
place
so
she
took
the
remaining
chair
against
the
wall
behind
agatha
facing
adam
across
the
table
and
with
adam
in
profile
at
the
head
and
little
susan
at
the
foot
then
she
waited
her
chance
being
tired
and
aggressive
she
did
not
wait
long
i
might
as
well
tell
you
why
i
came
she
said
bluntly
father
give
me
money
to
go
to
normal
as
he
has
all
the
others
he
says
i
have
got
to
stay
at
home
and
help
mother
well
mother
is
getting
so
old
she
needs
help
said
adam
as
he
continued
his
supper
of
course
she
is
said
kate
we
all
know
that
but
what
is
the
matter
with
nancy
ellen
helping
her
while
i
take
my
turn
at
normal
there
was
a
thing
i
could
do
last
summer
to
help
her
off
that
i
did
do
even
to
lending
her
my
best
dress
and
staying
at
home
for
six
sundays
because
i
had
nothing
else
fit
to
wear
where
i
be
seen
no
one
said
a
word
kate
continued
then
father
secured
our
home
school
for
her
and
i
had
to
spend
the
winter
going
to
school
to
her
when
you
very
well
know
that
i
always
studied
harder
and
was
ahead
of
her
even
after
she
been
to
normal
and
i
got
up
early
and
worked
late
and
cooked
and
washed
and
waited
on
her
while
she
got
her
lessons
and
reports
ready
and
fixed
up
her
nice
new
clothes
and
now
she
wo
touch
the
work
and
she
is
doing
all
she
can
to
help
father
keep
me
from
going
i
never
knew
father
to
need
much
help
on
anything
he
made
up
his
mind
to
said
adam
kate
sat
very
tense
she
looked
steadily
at
her
brother
but
he
looked
quite
as
steadily
at
his
plate
the
back
of
her
was
fully
as
expressive
as
her
face
her
head
was
very
erect
her
shoulders
stiff
and
still
not
a
curl
moved
as
she
poured
adam
tea
and
susan
milk
only
adam
looked
at
kate
with
companionable
eyes
as
if
he
might
feel
a
slight
degree
of
interest
or
sympathy
so
she
found
herself
explaining
directly
to
him
things
are
blame
unfair
in
our
family
anyway
she
said
bitterly
you
have
got
to
be
born
a
boy
to
have
any
chance
worth
while
if
you
are
a
girl
it
is
mighty
small
and
if
you
are
the
youngest
by
any
mischance
you
have
none
at
all
i
do
want
to
harp
things
over
but
i
wish
you
would
explain
to
me
why
having
been
born
a
few
years
after
nancy
ellen
makes
me
her
slave
and
cuts
me
out
of
my
chance
to
teach
and
to
have
some
freedom
and
clothes
they
might
as
well
have
told
hiram
he
was
not
to
have
any
land
and
stay
at
home
and
help
father
because
he
was
the
youngest
boy
it
would
have
been
quite
as
fair
but
nothing
like
that
happens
to
the
boys
of
this
family
it
is
always
the
girls
who
get
left
i
have
worked
for
years
knowing
every
cent
i
saved
and
earned
above
barely
enough
to
cover
me
would
go
to
help
pay
for
hiram
land
and
house
and
stock
but
he
would
turn
a
hand
to
help
me
neither
will
any
of
the
rest
of
you
then
what
are
you
here
for
asked
adam
because
i
am
going
to
give
you
and
every
other
brother
and
sister
i
have
the
chance
to
refuse
to
loan
me
enough
to
buy
a
few
clothes
and
pay
my
way
to
normal
so
i
can
pass
the
examinations
and
teach
this
fall
and
when
you
have
all
refused
i
am
going
to
the
neighbours
until
i
find
someone
who
will
loan
me
the
money
i
need
a
hundred
dollars
would
be
plenty
i
could
pay
it
back
with
two
teaching
with
any
interest
you
say
kate
paused
short
of
breath
her
eyes
blazing
her
cheeks
red
adam
went
steadily
on
with
his
supper
agatha
appeared
stiffer
and
more
uncompromising
in
the
back
than
before
which
kate
had
not
thought
possible
but
the
same
dull
red
on
the
girl
cheeks
had
begun
to
burn
on
the
face
of
young
adam
suddenly
he
broke
into
a
clear
laugh
oh
ma
you
too
funny
he
cried
i
can
read
your
face
like
a
book
i
bet
you
ten
dollars
i
can
tell
you
just
word
for
word
what
you
are
going
to
say
i
dare
you
let
me
you
know
i
can
still
laughing
his
eyes
dancing
a
picture
to
see
he
stretched
his
arm
across
the
table
toward
her
and
his
mother
adored
him
however
she
strove
to
conceal
the
fact
from
him
ten
dollars
she
scoffed
when
did
we
become
so
wealthy
i
give
you
one
dollar
if
you
tell
me
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
say
the
boy
glanced
at
his
father
oh
this
is
too
easy
he
cried
like
robbing
the
baby
bank
and
then
to
his
mother
you
were
just
opening
your
lips
to
say
it
to
her
if
you
do
i
will
and
you
are
even
a
little
bit
more
of
a
brick
than
usual
to
do
it
it
a
darned
shame
the
way
all
of
them
impose
on
kate
there
was
a
complete
change
in
agatha
back
adam
laid
down
his
fork
and
stared
at
his
wife
in
deep
amazement
adam
stretched
his
hand
farther
toward
his
mother
give
me
that
dollar
he
cajoled
well
i
am
not
concealing
it
in
the
sleeve
of
my
garments
she
said
if
i
have
one
it
is
reposing
in
my
purse
in
juxtaposition
to
the
other
articles
that
belong
there
and
if
you
receive
it
it
will
be
bestowed
upon
you
when
i
deem
the
occasion
suitable
young
adam
fist
came
down
with
a
smash
i
get
the
dollar
he
triumphed
i
told
you
so
i
knew
she
was
going
to
say
it
ai
i
a
dandy
mind
reader
though
but
it
is
bully
for
you
father
because
of
course
if
mother
would
let
kate
have
it
you
have
to
but
if
you
did
it
might
make
trouble
with
your
paternal
and
endanger
your
precious
deed
that
you
hope
to
get
in
the
sweet
but
if
mother
loans
the
money
grandfather
ca
say
a
word
because
it
is
her
very
own
and
did
cost
him
anything
and
he
always
agrees
with
her
anyway
hurrah
for
hurrah
kate
nancy
ellen
may
wash
her
own
petticoat
in
the
morning
while
i
take
you
to
the
train
you
let
me
father
you
did
let
me
go
to
hartley
alone
once
i
be
careful
i
wo
let
a
thing
happen
i
come
straight
home
and
oh
my
dollar
you
and
me
i
put
you
in
the
bank
and
let
you
grow
to
three
you
may
go
said
his
father
promptly
you
shall
proceed
according
to
your
aunt
katherine
instructions
said
his
mother
at
the
same
time
katie
get
your
when
do
we
start
demanded
young
adam
morning
will
be
all
right
with
me
you
blessed
youngun
said
kate
but
i
do
own
a
telescope
or
anything
to
put
what
little
i
have
in
and
nancy
ellen
never
would
spare
hers
she
will
want
to
go
to
county
institute
before
i
get
back
you
may
have
mine
said
agatha
you
are
perfectly
welcome
to
take
it
wherever
your
peregrinations
lead
you
and
return
it
when
you
please
i
shall
proceed
to
my
chamber
and
formulate
your
check
immediately
you
are
also
welcome
to
my
best
hat
and
cape
and
any
of
my
clothing
or
personal
adornments
you
can
use
to
advantage
oh
agatha
i
wish
you
were
as
big
as
a
house
like
me
said
kate
joyfully
i
could
possibly
crowd
into
anything
you
wear
but
it
would
almost
tickle
me
to
death
to
have
nancy
ellen
know
you
let
me
take
your
things
when
she
wo
even
offer
me
a
dud
of
her
old
stuff
i
never
remotely
hoped
for
any
of
the
new
you
shall
have
my
cape
and
hat
anyway
the
cape
is
new
and
very
fashionable
come
upstairs
and
try
the
hat
said
agatha
the
cape
was
new
and
fashionable
as
agatha
had
said
it
would
not
fasten
at
the
neck
but
there
would
be
no
necessity
that
it
should
during
july
and
august
while
it
would
improve
any
dress
it
was
worn
with
on
a
cool
evening
the
hat
kate
could
not
possibly
use
with
her
large
broad
face
and
mass
of
hair
but
she
was
almost
as
pleased
with
the
offer
as
if
the
hat
had
been
most
becoming
then
agatha
brought
out
her
telescope
in
which
kate
laid
the
cape
while
agatha
wrote
her
a
check
for
one
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
and
told
her
where
and
how
to
cash
it
the
extra
twenty
was
to
buy
a
pair
of
new
walking
shoes
some
hose
and
a
hat
before
she
went
to
her
train
when
they
went
downstairs
adam
had
a
horse
hitched
and
adam
drove
her
to
her
home
where
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
they
took
one
long
survey
of
the
landscape
and
hid
the
telescope
behind
the
privet
bush
then
adam
drove
away
quietly
kate
entered
the
dooryard
from
the
garden
and
soon
afterward
went
to
the
wash
room
and
hastily
ironed
her
clothing
nancy
ellen
had
gone
to
visit
a
neighbour
girl
so
kate
risked
her
remaining
until
after
church
in
the
evening
she
hurried
to
their
room
and
mended
all
her
own
clothing
she
had
laid
out
then
she
deliberately
went
over
nancy
ellen
and
helped
herself
to
a
pair
of
pretty
nightdresses
such
as
she
had
never
owned
a
white
embroidered
petticoat
the
second
best
white
dress
and
a
most
becoming
sailor
hat
these
she
made
into
a
parcel
and
carried
to
the
wash
room
brought
in
the
telescope
and
packed
it
hiding
it
under
a
workbench
and
covering
it
with
shavings
after
that
she
went
to
her
room
and
wrote
a
note
and
then
slept
deeply
until
the
morning
call
she
arose
at
once
and
went
to
the
wash
room
but
instead
of
washing
the
family
clothing
she
took
a
bath
in
the
largest
tub
and
washed
her
hair
to
a
state
resembling
spun
gold
during
breakfast
she
kept
sharp
watch
down
the
road
when
she
saw
adam
coming
she
stuck
her
note
under
the
hook
on
which
she
had
seen
her
father
hang
his
hat
all
her
life
and
carrying
the
telescope
in
the
clothes
basket
covered
with
a
rumpled
sheet
she
passed
across
the
yard
and
handed
it
over
the
fence
to
adam
climbed
that
same
fence
and
they
started
toward
hartley
kate
put
the
sailor
hat
on
her
head
and
sat
very
straight
an
anxious
line
crossing
her
forehead
she
was
running
away
and
if
discovered
there
was
the
barest
chance
that
her
father
might
follow
and
make
a
most
disagreeable
scene
before
the
train
pulled
out
he
had
gone
to
a
far
field
to
plow
corn
and
kate
fervently
hoped
he
would
plow
until
noon
which
he
did
nancy
ellen
washed
the
dishes
and
went
into
the
front
room
to
study
while
bates
put
on
her
sunbonnet
and
began
hoeing
the
potatoes
not
one
of
the
family
noticed
that
monday
wash
was
not
on
the
clothes
line
as
usual
kate
and
adam
drove
as
fast
as
they
dared
and
on
reaching
town
cashed
the
check
decided
that
nancy
ellen
hat
would
serve
thus
saving
the
price
of
a
new
one
for
emergencies
that
might
arise
bought
the
shoes
and
went
to
the
depot
where
they
had
an
anxious
hour
to
wait
i
expect
grandpa
will
be
pretty
mad
said
adam
i
am
sure
there
is
not
the
slightest
chance
but
that
he
will
be
said
kate
dare
you
go
back
home
when
school
is
over
he
asked
probably
not
she
answered
what
will
you
do
he
questioned
when
i
investigated
sister
nancy
ellen
bureau
i
found
a
list
of
the
school
supervisors
of
the
county
so
i
am
going
to
put
in
my
spare
time
writing
them
about
my
qualifications
to
teach
their
schools
this
winter
all
the
other
girls
did
well
and
taught
schools
i
shall
also
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
but
that
i
may
take
my
choice
of
several
when
i
finish
it
will
be
only
a
few
days
until
school
begins
so
i
can
go
hunt
my
boarding
place
and
stay
there
mother
would
let
you
stay
at
our
house
said
adam
yes
i
think
she
would
after
yesterday
but
i
do
want
to
make
trouble
that
might
extend
to
father
and
your
father
i
had
better
keep
away
yes
i
guess
you
had
said
adam
if
grandfather
rows
he
raises
a
racket
but
maybe
he
wo
maybe
would
you
like
to
see
what
happens
when
mother
come
in
from
the
potatoes
and
nancy
ellen
comes
out
from
the
living
room
and
father
comes
to
dinner
all
about
the
same
time
adam
laughed
appreciatively
would
i
just
he
cried
kate
you
like
my
mother
do
you
i
certainly
do
she
has
been
splendid
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
as
getting
the
money
from
her
i
did
either
said
adam
until
i
became
a
mind
reader
kate
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
how
about
that
adam
she
asked
adam
chuckled
she
did
intend
to
say
a
word
she
was
going
to
let
the
bateses
fight
it
out
among
themselves
her
mouth
was
shut
so
tight
it
did
look
as
if
she
could
open
it
if
she
wanted
to
i
thought
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
borrow
the
money
from
her
so
father
would
get
into
a
mess
and
i
knew
how
fine
she
was
so
i
just
suggested
it
to
her
that
all
adam
you
a
dandy
cried
kate
i
am
having
a
whole
buggy
load
of
fun
and
you
ought
to
go
said
he
it
all
right
do
you
worry
i
take
care
of
you
why
thank
you
adam
said
kate
that
is
the
first
time
any
one
ever
offered
to
take
care
of
me
in
my
life
with
me
it
always
has
been
pretty
much
of
a
proposition
what
of
nancy
ellen
did
you
take
he
asked
why
did
you
get
some
gloves
your
hands
are
so
red
and
mother
never
look
that
way
your
mother
never
has
done
the
rough
field
work
i
do
and
i
taken
time
to
be
careful
they
do
look
badly
i
wish
i
had
taken
a
pair
of
the
lady
gloves
but
i
doubt
if
she
would
have
survived
that
i
understand
that
one
of
the
unpardonable
sins
is
putting
on
gloves
belonging
to
any
one
else
then
the
train
came
and
kate
climbed
aboard
with
adam
parting
injunction
in
her
ears
sit
beside
an
open
window
on
this
side
so
she
looked
for
and
found
the
window
and
as
she
seated
herself
she
saw
adam
on
the
outside
and
leaned
to
speak
to
him
again
just
as
the
train
started
he
thrust
his
hand
inside
dropped
his
dollar
on
her
lap
and
in
a
tense
whisper
commanded
her
get
yourself
some
gloves
then
he
ran
kate
picked
up
the
dollar
while
her
eyes
dimmed
with
tears
why
the
fine
youngster
she
said
the
fine
youngster
adam
could
not
remember
when
he
ever
had
been
so
happy
as
he
was
driving
home
he
found
his
mother
singing
his
father
in
a
genial
mood
so
he
concluded
that
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
to
make
a
whole
family
happy
was
to
do
something
kind
for
someone
else
but
he
reflected
that
there
would
be
far
from
a
happy
family
at
his
grandfather
and
he
was
right
grandmother
bates
came
in
from
her
hoeing
at
eleven
tired
and
hungry
expecting
to
find
the
wash
dry
and
dinner
almost
ready
there
was
no
wash
and
no
odour
of
food
she
went
to
the
and
stared
unbelievingly
at
the
cold
stove
the
tubs
of
soaking
clothes
she
turned
and
went
into
the
kitchen
where
she
saw
no
signs
of
kate
or
of
dinner
then
she
lifted
up
her
voice
and
shouted

she

you
look
if

nancy
ellen
straightened

time
last
year

she
wo
father
will
see
that
she
never
darkens
these
doors
again
this
is
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
a
child
of
his
has
disobeyed
him
except
adam
when
he
married
agatha
and
he
strutted
like
a
fighting
cock
about
that
well
he
wo
about

if

showing
signs
of

go
at
that
wash
while
i
get
dinner
dinner
was
on
the
table
when
adam
bates
hung
his
hat
on
its
hook
and
saw
the
note
for
him
he
took
it
down
and
read
father
i
have
gone
to
normal
i
borrowed
the
money
of
a
woman
who
was
willing
to
trust
me
to
pay
it
back
as
soon
as
i
earned
it
not
nancy
ellen
of
course
she
would
not
even
loan
me
a
pocket
handkerchief
though
you
remember
i
stayed
at
home
six
weeks
last
summer
to
let
her
take
what
she
wanted
of
mine
mother
i
think
you
can
get
sally
whistler
to
help
you
as
cheaply
as
any
one
and
that
she
will
do
very
well
nancy
ellen
i
have
taken
your
second
best
hat
and
a
few
of
your
things
but
not
half
so
many
as
i
loaned
you
i
hope
it
makes
you
mad
enough
to
burst
i
hope
you
get
as
mad
and
stay
as
mad
as
i
have
been
most
of
this
year
while
you
taught
me
things
you
know
yourself
and
i
cooked
and
washed
for
you
so
you
could
wear
fine
clothes
and
play
the
lady
kate
adam
bates
read
that
note
to
himself
stretching
every
inch
of
his
six
feet
six
his
face
a
dull
red
his
eyes
glaring
then
he
turned
to
his
wife
and
daughter
is
kate
gone
without
proper
clothing
and
on
borrowed
money
he
demanded
i
do
know
said
bates
i
was
hoeing
potatoes
all
forenoon
listen
to
this
he
thundered
then
he
slowly
read
the
note
aloud
but
someway
the
spoken
words
did
not
have
the
same
effect
as
when
he
read
them
mentally
in
the
first
shock
of
anger
when
he
heard
his
own
voice
read
off
the
line
i
hope
it
makes
you
mad
enough
to
burst
there
was
a
catch
and
a
queer
gurgle
in
his
throat
bates
gazed
at
him
anxiously
was
he
so
surprised
and
angry
he
was
choking
might
it
be
a
stroke
it
was
it
was
a
master
stroke
he
got
no
farther
than
taught
me
things
you
did
know
yourself
when
he
lowered
the
sheet
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
as
none
of
his
family
ever
had
seen
him
laugh
in
his
life
laughed
and
laughed
until
his
frame
was
shaken
and
the
tears
rolled
finally
he
looked
at
the
dazed
nancy
ellen
get
sally
whistler
nothing
he
said
you
hustle
your
stumps
and
do
for
your
mother
what
kate
did
while
you
were
away
last
summer
and
if
you
have
any
common
decency
send
your
sister
as
many
of
your
best
things
as
you
had
of
hers
at
least
do
you
hear
me
chapter
iii
peregrinations
peregrinations
laughed
kate
turning
to
the
window
to
hide
her
face
oh
agatha
you
are
a
dear
but
you
are
too
funny
even
a
fourth
of
july
orator
would
not
have
used
that
word
i
never
heard
it
before
in
all
of
my
life
outside
then
she
looked
at
the
dollar
she
was
gripping
and
ceased
to
laugh
the
dear
lad
she
whispered
he
did
the
whole
thing
she
was
going
to
let
us
it
out
i
could
tell
by
her
back
and
adam
have
helped
me
a
cent
quite
as
much
because
he
did
want
to
as
because
father
would
have
liked
it
fancy
the
little
chap
knowing
he
can
wheedle
his
mother
into
anything
and
exactly
how
to
go
about
it
i
wo
spend
a
penny
on
myself
until
she
is
paid
and
then
make
her
a
present
of
something
nice
just
to
let
her
and
nancy
ellen
see
that
i
appreciate
being
helped
to
my
chance
for
i
had
reached
that
point
where
i
would
have
walked
to
school
and
worked
in
kitchen
before
i
have
missed
my
opportunity
i
could
have
done
it
but
this
will
be
far
pleasanter
and
give
me
a
much
better
showing
then
kate
began
watching
the
people
in
the
car
with
eager
curiosity
for
she
had
been
on
a
train
only
twice
before
in
her
life
she
decided
that
she
was
in
a
company
of
young
people
and
some
even
of
middle
age
going
to
normal
she
also
noticed
that
most
of
them
were
looking
at
her
with
probably
the
same
interest
she
found
in
them
then
at
one
of
the
stations
a
girl
asked
to
sit
with
her
and
explained
that
she
was
going
to
normal
so
kate
said
she
was
also
the
girl
seemed
to
have
several
acquaintances
on
the
car
for
she
left
her
seat
to
speak
with
them
and
when
the
train
stopped
at
a
very
pleasant
city
and
the
car
began
to
empty
itself
on
the
platform
kate
was
introduced
by
this
girl
to
several
young
women
and
men
near
her
age
a
party
of
four
going
to
board
close
the
school
with
a
woman
they
knew
about
invited
kate
to
go
with
them
and
because
she
was
strange
and
shaken
by
her
experiences
she
agreed
all
of
them
piled
their
luggage
on
a
wagon
to
be
delivered
so
kate
let
hers
go
also
then
they
walked
down
a
long
shady
street
and
entered
a
dainty
and
comfortable
residence
a
place
that
seemed
to
kate
to
be
the
home
of
people
of
wealth
she
was
assigned
a
room
with
another
girl
such
a
pleasant
girl
but
a
vague
uneasiness
had
begun
to
make
itself
felt
so
before
she
unpacked
she
went
back
to
the
sitting
room
and
learned
that
the
price
of
board
was
eight
dollars
a
week
dollars
for
six
weeks
she
would
not
have
enough
for
books
and
tuition
besides
nancy
ellen
had
boarded
with
a
family
on
butler
street
whose
charge
was
only
kate
was
eager
to
stay
where
these
very
agreeable
young
people
did
she
imagined
herself
going
to
classes
with
them
and
having
association
that
to
her
would
be
a
great
treat
but
she
never
would
dare
ask
for
more
money
she
thought
swiftly
a
minute
and
then
made
her
first
mistake
instead
of
going
to
the
other
girls
and
frankly
confessing
that
she
could
not
afford
the
prices
they
were
paying
she
watched
her
chance
picked
up
her
telescope
and
hurried
down
the
street
walking
swiftly
until
she
was
out
of
sight
of
the
house
then
she
began
inquiring
her
way
to
butler
street
and
after
a
long
hot
walk
found
the
place
the
rooms
and
board
were
very
poor
but
kate
felt
that
she
could
endure
whatever
nancy
ellen
had
so
she
unpacked
and
went
to
the
normal
school
to
register
and
learn
what
she
would
need
on
coming
from
the
building
she
saw
that
she
would
be
forced
to
pass
close
by
the
group
of
girls
she
had
deserted
and
this
was
made
doubly
difficult
because
she
could
see
that
they
were
talking
about
her
then
she
understood
how
foolish
she
had
been
and
as
she
was
struggling
to
summon
courage
to
explain
to
them
she
caught
these
words
plainly
who
is
going
to
ask
her
for
it
i
am
said
the
girl
who
had
sat
beside
kate
on
the
train
i
propose
to
pay
it
myself
then
she
came
directly
to
kate
and
said
briefly
fifty
cents
please
for
what
stammered
kate
your
luggage
you
changed
your
boarding
place
in
such
a
hurry
you
forgot
to
settle
and
as
i
made
the
arrangement
i
had
to
pay
it
do
please
excuse
me
said
kate
i
was
so
bewildered
i
forgot
certainly
said
the
girl
and
kate
dropped
the
money
into
the
extended
hand
and
hurried
past
her
face
scorched
red
with
shame
for
one
of
them
had
said
that
a
good
one
i
would
have
thought
it
of
her
kate
went
back
to
her
hot
stuffy
room
and
tried
to
study
but
she
succeeded
only
in
being
miserable
for
she
realized
that
she
had
lost
her
second
chance
to
have
either
companions
or
friends
by
not
saying
the
few
words
of
explanation
that
would
have
righted
her
in
the
opinion
of
those
she
would
meet
each
day
for
six
weeks
it
was
not
a
good
beginning
while
the
end
was
what
might
have
been
expected
a
young
man
from
her
neighbourhood
spoke
to
her
and
the
girls
seeing
asked
him
about
kate
learning
thereby
that
her
father
was
worth
more
money
than
all
of
theirs
put
together
some
of
them
had
accepted
the
explanation
that
kate
was
bewildered
and
had
acted
hastily
but
when
the
young
man
finished
bates
history
they
merely
thought
her
mean
and
left
her
severely
to
herself
so
her
only
recourse
was
to
study
so
diligently
and
recite
so
perfectly
that
none
of
them
could
equal
her
and
this
she
did
in
acute
discomfort
and
with
a
sore
heart
kate
passed
her
first
six
weeks
away
from
home
she
wrote
to
each
man
on
the
list
of
school
directors
she
had
taken
from
nancy
ellen
desk
some
answered
that
they
had
their
teachers
already
engaged
others
made
no
reply
one
bright
spot
was
the
receipt
of
a
letter
from
nancy
ellen
saying
she
was
sending
her
best
dress
to
be
very
careful
of
it
and
if
kate
would
let
her
know
the
day
she
would
be
home
she
would
meet
her
at
the
station
kate
sent
her
thanks
wore
the
dress
to
two
lectures
and
wrote
the
letter
telling
when
she
would
return
as
the
time
drew
nearer
she
became
sickeningly
anxious
about
a
school
what
if
she
failed
in
securing
one
what
if
she
could
not
pay
back
agatha
money
what
if
she
had
taken
the
wings
of
morning
and
fallen
in
her
flight
in
desperation
she
went
to
the
superintendent
of
the
normal
and
told
him
her
trouble
he
wrote
her
a
fine
letter
of
recommendation
and
she
sent
it
to
one
of
the
men
from
whom
she
had
not
heard
the
director
of
a
school
in
the
village
of
walden
seven
miles
east
of
hartley
being
seventeen
miles
from
her
home
thus
seeming
to
kate
a
desirable
location
also
she
knew
the
village
to
be
pretty
and
the
school
one
that
paid
well
then
she
finished
her
work
the
best
she
could
and
disappointed
and
anxious
entered
the
train
for
home
when
the
engine
whistled
at
the
bridge
outside
hartley
kate
arose
lifted
her
telescope
from
the
rack
overhead
and
made
her
way
to
the
door
so
that
she
was
the
first
person
to
leave
the
car
when
it
stopped
as
she
stepped
to
the
platform
she
had
a
distinct
shock
for
her
father
reached
for
the
telescope
while
his
greeting
and
his
face
were
decidedly
friendly
for
him
as
they
walked
down
the
street
kate
was
trying
wildly
to
think
of
the
best
thing
to
say
when
he
asked
if
she
had
a
school
but
he
did
not
ask
then
she
saw
in
the
pocket
of
his
light
summer
coat
a
packet
of
letters
folded
inside
a
newspaper
and
there
was
one
long
envelope
that
stood
above
the
others
far
enough
that
she
could
see
miss
k
of
the
address
instantly
she
decided
that
it
was
her
answer
from
the
school
director
of
walden
and
she
was
tremblingly
eager
to
see
it
she
thought
an
instant
and
then
asked
have
you
been
to
the
post
office
yes
i
got
the
mail
he
answered
will
you
please
see
if
there
are
any
letters
for
me
she
asked
when
we
get
home
he
said
i
am
in
a
hurry
now
here
a
list
of
things
ma
wants
and
do
be
all
day
about
getting
them
kate
lips
closed
to
a
thin
line
and
her
eyes
began
to
grow
steel
coloured
and
big
she
dragged
back
a
step
and
looked
at
the
loosely
swaying
pocket
again
she
thought
intently
a
second
as
they
passed
several
people
on
the
walk
she
stepped
back
of
her
father
and
gently
raised
the
letter
enough
to
see
that
the
address
was
to
her
instantly
she
lifted
it
from
the
others
slipped
it
up
her
dress
sleeve
and
again
took
her
place
beside
her
father
until
they
reached
the
store
where
her
mother
did
her
shopping
then
he
waited
outside
while
kate
hurried
in
and
ripping
open
the
letter
found
a
contract
ready
for
her
to
sign
for
the
walden
school
the
salary
was
twenty
dollars
a
month
more
than
nancy
ellen
had
received
for
their
country
school
the
previous
winter
and
the
term
four
months
longer
kate
was
so
delighted
she
could
have
shouted
instead
she
went
with
all
speed
to
the
stationery
counter
and
bought
an
envelope
to
fit
the
contract
which
she
signed
and
writing
a
hasty
note
of
thanks
she
mailed
the
letter
in
the
store
mail
box
then
began
her
purchases
this
took
so
much
time
that
her
father
came
into
the
store
before
she
had
finished
demanding
that
she
hurry
so
in
feverish
haste
she
bought
what
was
wanted
and
followed
to
the
buggy
on
the
road
home
she
began
to
study
her
father
she
could
see
that
he
was
well
pleased
over
something
but
she
had
no
idea
what
could
have
happened
she
had
expected
anything
from
verbal
wrath
to
the
buggy
whip
so
she
was
surprised
but
so
happy
over
having
secured
such
a
good
school
at
higher
wages
than
nancy
ellen
that
she
spent
most
of
her
time
thinking
of
herself
and
planning
as
to
when
she
would
go
to
walden
where
she
would
stay
how
she
would
teach
and
oh
bliss
unspeakable
what
she
would
do
with
so
much
money
for
two
month
pay
would
more
than
wipe
out
her
indebtedness
to
agatha
and
by
getting
the
very
cheapest
board
she
could
endure
after
that
she
would
have
over
three
fourths
of
her
money
to
spend
each
month
for
books
and
clothes
she
was
intently
engaged
with
her
side
of
the
closet
and
her
end
of
the
bureau
when
she
had
her
first
glimpse
of
home
even
preoccupied
as
she
was
she
saw
a
difference
several
loose
pickets
in
the
fence
had
been
nailed
in
place
the
lilac
beside
the
door
and
the
cabbage
roses
had
been
trimmed
so
that
they
did
not
drag
over
the
walk
while
the
yard
had
been
gone
over
with
a
kate
turned
to
her
father
well
for
land
sake
she
said
i
wanted
a
all
last
summer
and
you
would
buy
it
for
me
i
wonder
why
you
got
it
the
minute
i
was
gone
i
got
it
because
nancy
ellen
especially
wanted
it
and
she
has
been
a
mighty
good
girl
all
summer
he
said
if
that
is
the
case
then
she
should
be
rewarded
with
the
privilege
of
running
a
said
kate
her
father
looked
at
her
sharply
but
her
face
was
so
pleasant
he
decided
she
did
not
intend
to
be
saucy
so
he
said
no
doubt
she
will
be
willing
to
let
you
help
her
all
you
want
to
not
the
ghost
of
a
doubt
about
that
laughed
kate
and
i
always
wanted
to
try
running
one
too
they
look
so
nice
in
pictures
and
how
one
improves
a
place
i
hardly
know
this
is
home
now
if
we
only
had
a
fresh
coat
of
white
paint
we
could
line
up
with
the
neighbours
i
have
been
thinking
about
that
said
bates
and
kate
glanced
at
him
doubting
her
hearing
he
noticed
her
surprise
and
added
in
explanation
paint
every
so
often
saves
a
building
it
good
economy
then
let
economize
immediately
said
kate
and
on
the
barn
too
it
is
even
more
than
the
house
i
see
about
it
the
next
time
i
go
to
town
said
bates
so
kate
entered
the
house
prepared
for
anything
and
wondering
what
it
all
meant
for
wherever
she
looked
everything
was
shining
the
brightest
that
scrubbing
and
scouring
could
make
it
shine
the
best
of
everything
was
out
and
in
use
not
that
it
was
much
but
it
made
a
noticeable
difference
her
mother
greeted
her
pleasantly
with
a
new
tone
of
voice
while
nancy
ellen
was
transformed
kate
noticed
that
immediately
she
always
had
been
a
pretty
girl
now
she
was
beautiful
radiantly
beautiful
with
a
new
shining
beauty
that
dazzled
kate
as
she
looked
at
her
no
one
offered
any
explanation
while
kate
could
see
none
at
last
she
asked
what
on
earth
has
happened
i
understand
of
course
you
do
laughed
nancy
ellen
you
thought
you
ran
the
whole
place
and
did
everything
yourself
so
i
thought
i
just
show
you
how
things
look
when
i
run
them
you
are
a
said
kate
figuratively
and
literally
i
offer
you
the
palm
let
the
good
work
go
on
i
highly
approve
but
i
do
see
how
you
found
time
to
do
all
this
and
go
to
institute
i
did
go
to
institute
said
nancy
ellen
you
did
but
you
must
cried
kate
oh
must
i
well
since
you
have
decided
to
run
your
affairs
as
you
please
in
spite
of
all
of
us
just
suppose
you
let
me
run
mine
the
same
way
only
i
rather
enjoy
having
father
and
mother
approve
of
what
i
do
kate
climbed
the
stairs
with
this
to
digest
as
she
went
so
while
she
put
away
her
clothing
she
thought
things
over
but
saw
no
light
she
would
go
to
adam
to
return
the
telescope
possibly
he
could
tell
her
as
she
hung
her
dresses
in
the
closet
and
returned
nancy
ellen
to
their
places
she
was
still
more
amazed
for
there
hung
three
pretty
new
wash
dresses
one
of
a
rosy
pink
that
would
make
nancy
ellen
appear
very
lovely
what
was
the
reason
kate
wondered
the
bates
family
never
did
anything
unless
there
was
some
purpose
in
it
what
was
the
purpose
in
this
and
nancy
ellen
had
not
gone
to
institute
she
evidently
had
worked
constantly
and
hard
yet
she
was
in
much
sweeter
frame
of
mind
than
usual
she
must
have
spent
almost
all
she
had
saved
from
her
school
on
new
clothes
kate
could
not
solve
the
problem
so
she
decided
to
watch
and
wait
she
also
waited
for
someone
to
say
something
about
her
plans
but
no
one
said
a
word
so
after
waiting
all
evening
kate
decided
that
they
would
ask
before
they
learned
anything
from
her
she
took
her
place
as
usual
and
the
work
went
on
as
if
she
had
not
been
away
but
she
was
happy
even
in
her
bewilderment
if
her
father
noticed
the
absence
of
the
letter
she
had
slipped
from
his
pocket
he
said
nothing
about
it
as
he
drew
the
paper
and
letters
forth
and
laid
them
on
the
table
kate
had
a
few
bad
minutes
while
this
was
going
on
she
was
sure
he
hesitated
an
instant
and
looked
closely
at
the
letters
he
sorted
but
when
he
said
nothing
she
breathed
deeply
in
relief
and
went
on
being
joyous
it
seemed
to
her
that
never
had
the
family
been
in
such
a
state
since
adam
had
married
agatha
and
her
three
hundred
acres
with
house
furniture
and
stock
she
went
on
in
ignorance
of
what
had
happened
until
after
sunday
dinner
the
following
day
then
she
had
planned
to
visit
agatha
and
adam
it
was
very
probable
that
it
was
because
she
was
dressing
for
this
visit
that
nancy
ellen
decided
on
kate
enlightenment
for
she
could
not
have
helped
seeing
that
her
sister
was
almost
stunned
at
times
kate
gave
her
a
fine
opening
as
she
stood
brushing
her
wealth
of
gold
with
sweeps
of
her
arm
she
was
at
an
angle
that
brought
her
facing
the
mirror
before
which
nancy
ellen
sat
training
waves
and
pinning
up
loose
braids
her
hair
was
beautiful
and
she
slowly
smiled
at
her
image
as
she
tried
different
effects
of
wave
loose
curl
braids
high
piled
or
flat
across
her
bed
lay
a
dress
that
was
a
reproduction
of
one
that
she
had
worn
for
three
years
but
a
glorified
reproduction
the
original
dress
had
been
nancy
ellen
first
departure
from
the
brown
and
gray
gingham
which
her
mother
always
had
purchased
because
it
would
wear
well
and
when
from
constant
washing
it
faded
to
an
exact
dirt
colour
it
had
the
advantage
of
providing
a
background
that
did
not
show
the
dirt
nancy
ellen
had
earned
the
money
for
a
new
dress
by
raising
turkeys
so
when
the
turkeys
went
to
town
to
be
sold
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
nancy
ellen
went
along
to
select
the
dress
no
one
told
her
what
kind
of
dress
to
get
because
no
one
imagined
that
she
would
dare
buy
any
startling
variation
from
what
always
had
been
provided
for
her
but
nancy
ellen
had
stood
facing
a
narrow
mirror
when
she
reached
the
gingham
counter
and
the
clerk
taking
one
look
at
her
fresh
beautiful
face
with
its
sharp
contrasts
of
black
eyes
and
hair
skin
that
refused
to
tan
and
red
cheeks
and
lips
began
shaking
out
delicate
blues
pale
pinks
golden
yellows
he
called
them
chambray
insisted
that
they
wore
for
ever
and
were
fadeless
which
was
practically
the
truth
on
the
day
that
dress
was
like
to
burst
its
waist
seams
it
was
the
same
warm
rosy
pink
that
transformed
nancy
ellen
from
the
disfiguration
of
to
apple
and
peach
bloom
wild
roses
and
swamp
mallow
a
girl
quite
as
pretty
as
a
girl
ever
grows
and
much
prettier
than
any
girl
ever
has
any
business
to
be
the
instant
nancy
ellen
held
the
chambray
under
her
chin
and
in
an
oblique
glance
saw
the
face
of
the
clerk
the
material
was
hers
no
matter
what
the
cost
which
does
not
refer
to
the
price
by
any
means
knowing
that
the
dress
would
be
an
innovation
that
would
set
her
mother
storming
and
fill
kate
with
envy
which
would
probably
culminate
in
the
demand
that
the
goods
be
returned
and
exchanged
for
when
she
reached
home
nancy
ellen
climbed
from
the
wagon
and
told
her
father
that
she
was
going
on
to
adam
to
have
agatha
cut
out
her
dress
so
that
she
could
begin
to
sew
on
it
that
night
such
commendable
industry
met
his
hearty
approval
so
he
told
her
to
go
and
he
would
see
that
kate
did
her
share
of
the
work
wise
nancy
ellen
came
home
and
sat
her
down
to
sew
on
her
gorgeous
frock
while
the
storm
she
had
feared
raged
in
all
its
fury
but
the
goods
was
cut
and
could
not
be
returned
yet
through
it
a
miracle
happened
nancy
ellen
so
appreciated
herself
in
pink
that
the
extreme
care
she
used
with
that
dress
saved
it
from
half
the
trips
of
a
one
to
the
wash
board
and
the
ironing
table
while
marvel
of
marvels
it
did
not
shrink
it
did
not
fade
also
it
wore
like
buckskin
the
result
was
that
before
the
season
had
passed
kate
was
allowed
to
purchase
a
pale
blue
which
improved
her
appearance
quite
as
much
in
proportion
as
pink
had
nancy
ellen
neither
did
the
blue
fade
nor
shrink
nor
require
so
much
washing
for
the
same
reason
three
years
the
pink
dress
had
been
nancy
ellen
piece
de
resistance
now
she
had
a
new
one
much
the
same
yet
conspicuously
different
this
was
a
daring
rose
colour
full
and
wide
peeping
white
embroidery
trimming
and
big
pearl
buttons
really
a
beautiful
dress
made
in
a
becoming
manner
kate
looked
at
it
in
cheerful
envy
never
mind
the
coming
summer
she
would
have
a
blue
that
would
make
that
pink
look
silly
from
the
dress
she
turned
to
nancy
ellen
barely
in
time
to
see
her
bend
her
head
and
smirk
broadly
smilingly
approvingly
at
her
reflection
in
the
glass
for
mercy
sake
what
is
the
matter
with
you
demanded
kate
ripping
a
strand
of
hair
in
sudden
irritation
oh
something
lovely
answered
her
sister
knowing
that
this
was
her
chance
to
impart
the
glad
tidings
herself
if
she
lost
it
agatha
would
get
the
thrill
of
kate
surprise
so
nancy
ellen
opened
her
drawer
and
slowly
produced
and
set
upon
her
bureau
a
cabinet
photograph
of
a
remarkably
handsome
young
man
then
she
turned
to
kate
and
smiled
a
slow
challenging
smile
kate
walked
over
and
picked
up
the
picture
studying
it
intently
but
in
growing
amazement
who
is
he
she
asked
finally
my
man
answered
nancy
ellen
possessively
triumphantly
kate
stared
at
her
honest
to
god
she
cried
in
wonderment
honest
said
nancy
ellen
where
on
earth
did
you
find
him
demanded
kate
picked
him
out
of
the
blackberry
patch
said
nancy
ellen
those
darn
blackberries
are
always
late
said
kate
throwing
the
picture
back
on
the
bureau
ai
that
just
my
luck
you
touch
the
raspberries
i
had
to
pick
them
every
one
myself
but
the
minute
i
turn
my
back
you
go
pick
a
man
like
that
out
of
the
blackberry
patch
i
bet
a
cow
you
wore
your
pink
chambray
and
carried
grandmother
old
blue
bowl
certainly
said
nancy
ellen
and
my
pink
i
think
maybe
the
bonnet
started
it
kate
sat
down
limply
on
the
first
chair
and
studied
the
toes
of
her
shoes
at
last
she
roused
and
looked
at
nancy
ellen
waiting
in
smiling
complaisance
as
she
returned
the
picture
to
her
end
of
the
bureau
well
why
do
you
go
ahead
cried
kate
in
a
thick
rasping
voice
empty
yourself
who
is
he
where
did
he
come
from
why
was
he
in
our
blackberry
patch
has
he
really
been
to
see
you
and
is
he
courting
you
in
earnest
but
of
course
he
is
there
the
lilac
bush
the
the
house
to
be
painted
and
a
humdinger
dress
is
he
a
millionaire
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
give
me
some
chance
i
did
meet
him
in
the
blackberry
patch
he
a
nephew
of
henry
lang
and
his
name
is
robert
gray
he
has
just
finished
a
medical
course
and
he
came
here
to
rest
and
look
at
hartley
for
a
location
because
lang
thinks
it
would
be
such
a
good
one
and
since
we
met
he
has
decided
to
take
an
office
in
hartley
and
he
has
money
to
furnish
it
and
to
buy
and
furnish
a
nice
house
great
jehoshaphat
cried
kate
and
i
bet
he
got
wings
too
i
do
have
the
rottenest
luck
you
act
for
all
the
world
as
if
it
were
a
foregone
conclusion
that
if
you
had
been
here
you
have
won
him
nancy
ellen
glanced
in
the
mirror
and
smiled
while
kate
saw
the
smile
she
picked
up
her
comb
and
drew
herself
to
full
height
if
anything
ever
was
a
conclusion
she
said
it
is
a
conclusion
that
if
i
had
been
here
i
have
picked
the
blackberries
and
so
i
have
had
the
first
chance
at
him
at
least
much
good
it
would
have
done
you
cried
nancy
ellen
wait
until
he
comes
and
you
see
him
you
may
do
your
mushing
in
private
said
kate
i
do
need
a
demonstration
to
convince
me
he
looks
from
the
picture
like
a
man
who
would
be
as
soft
as
a
frosted
pawpaw
nancy
ellen
face
flamed
crimson
you
hateful
she
cried
then
she
picked
up
the
picture
and
laid
it
face
down
in
her
drawer
while
two
big
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
kate
saw
those
also
instantly
she
relented
you
big
silly
goose
she
said
ca
you
tell
when
any
one
is
teasing
i
think
i
never
saw
a
finer
face
than
the
one
in
that
picture
i
jealous
because
i
never
left
home
a
day
before
in
all
my
life
and
the
minute
i
do
here
you
go
and
have
such
luck
are
you
really
sure
of
him
nancy
ellen
well
he
asked
father
and
mother
and
i
been
to
visit
his
folks
and
he
told
them
and
i
been
with
him
to
hartley
hunting
a
house
and
i
not
to
teach
this
winter
so
i
can
have
all
my
time
to
make
my
clothes
and
bedding
father
likes
him
fine
so
he
is
going
to
give
me
money
to
get
all
i
need
he
offered
to
himself
kate
finished
her
braid
pulled
the
combings
from
the
comb
and
slowly
wrapped
the
end
of
her
hair
as
she
digested
these
convincing
facts
she
swung
the
heavy
braid
around
her
head
placed
a
few
pins
then
crossed
to
her
sister
and
laid
a
shaking
hand
on
her
shoulder
her
face
was
working
strongly
nancy
ellen
i
did
mean
one
ugly
word
i
said
you
gave
me
an
awful
surprise
and
that
was
just
my
bald
ugly
bates
way
of
taking
it
i
think
you
are
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
i
ever
have
seen
alive
or
pictured
i
have
always
thought
you
would
make
a
fine
marriage
and
i
am
sure
you
will
i
have
a
doubt
that
robert
gray
is
all
you
think
him
and
i
am
as
glad
for
you
as
i
can
be
you
can
keep
house
in
hartley
for
two
with
scarcely
any
work
at
all
and
you
can
have
all
the
pretty
clothes
you
want
and
time
to
wear
them
doctors
always
get
rich
if
they
are
good
ones
and
he
is
sure
to
be
a
good
one
once
he
gets
a
start
if
only
we
were
so
beastly
healthy
there
are
enough
bates
and
langs
to
support
you
for
the
first
year
and
i
help
you
sew
and
do
all
i
can
for
you
now
wipe
up
and
look
your
handsomest
nancy
ellen
arose
and
put
her
arms
around
kate
neck
a
stunningly
unusual
proceeding
thank
you
she
said
that
is
big
and
fine
of
you
but
i
always
have
shirked
and
put
my
work
on
you
i
guess
now
i
quit
and
do
my
sewing
myself
then
she
slipped
the
pink
dress
over
her
head
and
stood
slowly
fastening
it
as
kate
started
to
leave
the
room
seeing
her
go
i
wish
you
would
wait
and
meet
robert
she
said
i
have
told
him
about
what
a
nice
sister
i
have
i
think
i
go
on
to
adam
now
said
kate
i
do
want
to
wait
until
they
go
some
place
and
i
miss
them
i
do
better
to
meet
your
man
after
i
become
more
accustomed
to
bare
facts
anyway
by
the
way
is
he
as
tall
as
you
yes
said
nancy
ellen
laughing
he
is
an
inch
and
a
half
taller
why
oh
i
hate
seeing
a
woman
taller
than
her
husband
and
i
always
wondered
where
we
find
men
to
reach
our
shoulders
but
if
they
can
be
picked
at
random
from
the
berry
patch
so
kate
went
on
her
way
laughing
lifting
her
white
skirts
high
from
the
late
august
dust
she
took
a
short
cut
through
the
woods
and
at
a
small
stream
with
sure
foot
crossed
the
log
to
within
a
few
steps
of
the
opposite
bank
there
she
stopped
for
a
young
man
rounded
the
bushes
and
set
a
foot
on
the
same
log
then
he
and
kate
looked
straight
into
each
other
eyes
kate
saw
a
forceful
young
face
with
strong
lines
and
good
colouring
clear
gray
eyes
sandy
brown
hair
even
hard
white
teeth
and
broad
shoulders
a
little
above
her
own
the
man
saw
kate
dressed
in
her
best
and
looking
her
best
slowly
she
extended
her
hand
i
bet
a
picayune
you
are
my
new
brother
robert
she
said
the
young
man
gripped
her
hand
firmly
held
it
and
kept
on
looking
in
rather
a
stunned
manner
at
kate
well
are
you
she
asked
trying
to
withdraw
the
hand
i
never
never
would
have
believed
it
he
said
believed
what
asked
kate
leaving
the
hand
where
it
was
that
there
could
be
two
in
the
same
family
said
he
but
i
as
different
from
nancy
ellen
as
night
from
day
said
kate
besides
woe
is
me
i
did
wear
a
pink
dress
and
pick
you
from
the
berry
patch
in
a
blue
bowl
then
the
man
released
her
hand
and
laughed
you
would
have
had
the
slightest
trouble
if
you
had
been
there
he
said
except
that
i
should
have
inverted
my
bowl
said
kate
calmly
i
am
looking
for
a
millionaire
riding
a
steed
and
he
must
be
much
taller
than
you
and
have
black
hair
and
eyes
brother
i
will
see
you
this
evening
then
kate
went
down
the
path
to
deliver
the
telescope
render
her
thanks
make
her
promise
of
speedy
payment
and
for
the
first
time
tell
her
good
news
about
her
school
she
found
that
she
was
very
happy
as
she
went
and
quite
convinced
that
her
first
flight
would
prove
entirely
successful
chapter
iv
a
question
of
contracts
hello
folks
cried
kate
waving
her
hand
to
the
occupants
of
the
veranda
as
she
went
up
the
walk
glad
to
find
you
at
home
that
is
where
you
will
always
find
me
unless
i
am
forced
away
on
business
said
her
brother
as
they
shook
hands
agatha
was
pleased
with
this
and
stiff
as
steel
she
bent
the
length
of
her
body
toward
kate
and
gave
her
a
little
peck
on
the
cheek
i
came
over
as
soon
as
i
could
said
kate
as
she
took
the
chair
her
brother
offered
to
thank
you
for
the
big
thing
you
did
for
me
agatha
when
you
lent
me
that
money
if
i
had
known
where
i
was
going
or
the
help
it
would
be
to
me
i
should
have
gone
if
i
had
to
walk
and
work
for
my
board
why
i
feel
so
sure
of
myself
i
learned
so
much
that
i
like
the
girl
fresh
from
boarding
school
only
wonder
is
that
one
small
head
can
contain
it
all
thank
you
over
and
over
and
i
got
a
good
school
so
i
can
pay
you
back
the
very
first
month
i
think
if
there
are
things
i
must
have
i
can
pay
part
the
first
month
and
the
remainder
the
second
i
am
eager
for
i
ca
even
picture
the
bliss
of
having
that
much
money
in
my
fingers
all
my
own
to
do
with
as
i
please
wo
it
be
grand
in
the
same
breath
said
agatha
procure
yourself
some
clothes
said
adam
start
a
bank
account
said
kate
right
you
are
i
shall
do
both
even
our
little
susan
has
a
bank
account
said
adam
proudly
which
is
no
reflection
whatever
on
me
laughed
kate
susan
did
not
have
the
same
father
and
mother
i
had
i
like
to
see
a
girl
of
my
branch
of
the
bates
family
start
a
bank
account
at
ten
no
i
guess
she
would
admitted
adam
dryly
but
have
you
heard
that
nancy
ellen
has
started
cried
kate
only
think
a
the
house
and
barn
to
be
painted
all
the
dinge
possible
to
remove
scoured
away
inside
she
must
have
worn
her
fingers
almost
to
the
bone
and
really
agatha
have
you
seen
the
man
he
as
big
as
adam
and
just
fine
looking
i
simply
consumed
with
envy
miss
medira
dora
ann
cast
her
net
and
catched
a
man
recited
susan
from
the
top
step
at
which
they
all
laughed
no
i
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
casting
my
optics
upon
the
individual
of
nancy
ellen
choice
said
agatha
primly
but
miss
amelia
lang
tells
me
he
is
a
very
distinguished
person
of
quite
superior
education
in
a
medical
way
i
shall
call
him
if
i
ever
have
the
misfortune
to
fall
ill
again
i
hope
you
will
tell
nancy
ellen
that
we
shall
be
very
pleased
to
have
her
bring
him
to
see
us
some
evening
and
if
she
will
let
me
know
a
short
time
ahead
i
shall
take
great
pleasure
in
compounding
a
cake
and
freezing
custard
of
course
i
shall
tell
her
and
she
will
feel
a
trifle
more
stuck
up
than
she
does
now
if
that
is
possible
laughed
kate
in
deep
amusement
she
surely
was
feeling
fine
everything
had
come
out
so
splendidly
that
was
what
came
of
having
a
little
spirit
and
standing
up
for
your
rights
also
she
was
bubbling
inside
while
agatha
talked
kate
wondered
how
adam
survived
it
every
day
she
glanced
at
him
to
see
if
she
could
detect
any
marks
of
shattered
nerves
then
laughed
outright
adam
was
the
finest
physical
specimen
of
a
man
she
knew
he
was
good
looking
also
and
spoke
as
well
as
the
average
better
in
fact
for
from
the
day
of
their
marriage
agatha
sat
on
his
lap
each
night
and
said
these
words
my
beloved
i
noted
an
error
in
your
speech
it
would
put
a
former
teacher
to
much
embarrassment
to
have
this
occur
in
public
in
the
future
will
you
not
try
to
remember
that
you
should
say
gone
instead
of
went
as
she
talked
agatha
rumpled
adam
hair
pulled
off
his
string
tie
upon
which
she
insisted
even
when
he
was
plowing
laid
her
hard
little
face
against
his
and
held
him
tight
with
her
frail
arms
so
that
adam
being
part
human
as
well
as
part
bates
held
her
closely
also
and
said
these
words
you
bet
your
sweet
life
i
will
and
what
is
more
he
did
he
followed
a
furrow
the
next
day
softly
muttering
over
to
himself
langs
have
gone
to
town
i
have
gone
to
work
the
birds
have
gone
to
building
nests
so
adam
seldom
said
have
went
or
made
any
other
error
in
speech
that
agatha
had
once
corrected
as
kate
watched
him
leaning
back
in
his
chair
vital
a
study
in
the
supremest
kind
of
satisfaction
on
his
face
she
noted
the
flash
that
lighted
his
eye
when
agatha
offered
to
freeze
a
custard
how
like
agatha
any
other
woman
kate
knew
would
have
said
make
ice
cream
agatha
explained
to
them
that
when
they
beat
up
eggs
added
milk
sugar
and
it
was
custard
when
they
used
pure
cream
sweetened
and
frozen
it
was
iced
cream
personally
she
preferred
the
custard
but
she
did
not
propose
to
call
it
custard
cream
it
was
not
correct
why
persist
in
misstatements
and
inaccuracies
when
one
knew
better
so
agatha
said
iced
cream
when
she
meant
it
and
frozen
custard
when
custard
it
was
but
every
other
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
had
she
acted
as
she
felt
would
have
slapped
agatha
face
when
she
said
it
this
both
adam
and
kate
well
knew
so
it
made
kate
laugh
despite
the
fact
that
she
would
not
have
offended
agatha
purposely
i
think
i
think
said
agatha
that
nancy
ellen
has
much
upon
which
to
congratulate
herself
more
education
would
not
injure
her
but
she
has
enough
that
if
she
will
allow
her
ambition
to
rule
her
and
study
in
private
and
spend
her
spare
time
communing
with
the
best
writers
she
can
make
an
exceedingly
fair
intellectual
showing
while
she
surely
is
a
handsome
woman
with
a
good
home
and
such
a
fine
young
professional
man
as
she
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
attract
she
should
immediately
put
herself
at
the
head
of
society
in
hartley
and
become
its
leader
to
a
much
higher
moral
and
intellectual
plane
than
it
now
occupies
bet
she
has
a
good
time
said
young
adam
he
awful
nice
son
said
agatha
means
full
of
awe
a
cyclone
a
cloudburst
a
great
conflagration
are
awful
things
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
they
be
called
nice
but
ma
if
a
cyclone
blew
away
your
worst
enemy
would
it
be
nice
adam
and
kate
laughed
not
the
trace
of
a
smile
crossed
pale
face
the
words
do
not
belong
in
contiguity
she
said
they
are
diametrically
opposite
in
meaning
please
do
not
allow
my
ears
to
be
offended
by
hearing
you
place
them
in
propinquity
again
i
try
not
to
ma
said
young
adam
then
agatha
smiled
on
him
approvingly
when
did
you
meet
gray
katherine
she
asked
on
the
crossing
the
creek
beside
lang
line
fence
near
the
spot
nancy
ellen
first
met
him
i
imagine
how
did
you
recognize
him
nancy
ellen
had
just
been
showing
me
his
picture
and
telling
me
about
him
great
day
but
she
in
love
with
him
and
so
he
is
with
her
if
lang
conclusions
from
his
behaviour
can
be
depended
upon
they
inform
me
that
he
can
be
induced
to
converse
on
no
other
subject
the
whole
arrangement
appeals
to
me
as
distinctly
admirable
and
you
should
see
the
lilac
bush
and
the
cabbage
roses
said
kate
and
the
strangest
thing
is
father
he
is
peaceable
as
a
lamb
she
is
not
to
teach
but
to
spend
the
winter
sewing
on
her
clothes
and
bedding
and
father
told
her
he
would
give
her
the
necessary
money
she
said
so
and
i
suspect
he
will
he
always
favoured
her
because
she
was
so
pretty
and
she
can
come
closer
to
wheedling
him
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
excepting
you
agatha
it
is
an
innovation
surely
mother
is
nearly
as
bad
father
furnishing
money
for
clothes
and
painting
the
barn
is
no
more
remarkable
than
mother
letting
her
turn
the
house
inside
out
if
it
had
been
i
father
would
have
told
me
to
teach
my
school
this
winter
buy
my
own
clothes
and
linen
with
the
money
i
had
earned
and
do
my
sewing
next
summer
but
i
am
not
jealous
it
is
because
she
is
handsome
and
the
man
and
with
such
good
prospects
there
you
have
it
said
adam
emphatically
if
it
were
you
marrying
jim
lang
to
live
on
lang
west
forty
you
would
pay
your
own
way
but
if
it
were
you
marrying
a
young
doctor
who
will
soon
be
a
power
in
hartley
no
doubt
it
would
tickle
father
vanity
until
he
would
do
the
same
for
you
i
doubt
it
said
kate
i
ca
see
the
vanity
in
father
you
ca
said
adam
bitterly
maybe
not
you
have
not
been
with
him
in
the
treasurer
office
when
he
calls
for
tax
on
those
little
parcels
of
land
of
mine
he
looks
every
inch
of
six
feet
six
then
and
swells
like
a
toad
to
hear
him
you
would
think
sixteen
hundred
and
fifty
acres
of
the
cream
of
this
county
could
be
tied
in
a
bandanna
and
carried
on
a
walking
stick
he
is
so
casual
about
it
and
those
men
fly
around
like
buttons
on
a
barn
door
to
wait
on
him
and
it
bates
this
and
bates
that
until
it
turns
my
stomach
vanity
he
rolls
in
it
he
eats
it
he
risks
losing
our
land
for
us
that
some
of
us
have
slaved
over
for
twenty
years
to
feed
that
especial
vein
of
his
vanity
where
should
we
be
if
he
let
anything
happen
to
those
deeds
how
refreshing
cried
kate
i
love
to
hear
you
grouching
i
hear
nothing
else
from
the
women
of
the
bates
family
but
i
did
even
know
the
men
had
a
grouch
are
peter
and
john
and
hiram
and
the
other
boys
sore
too
i
should
say
they
are
but
they
are
too
diplomatic
to
say
so
they
are
afraid
to
cheep
i
just
open
my
head
and
say
right
out
loud
in
meeting
that
since
i
turned
in
the
taxes
and
insurance
for
all
these
years
and
improved
my
land
more
than
fifty
per
i
like
to
own
it
and
pay
my
taxes
myself
like
a
man
i
like
to
have
some
land
under
any
conditions
said
kate
but
probably
i
never
shall
and
i
bet
you
never
get
a
flipper
on
that
deed
until
father
has
crossed
over
jordan
which
with
his
health
and
strength
wo
be
for
years
yet
at
least
he
performing
a
miracle
that
will
make
the
other
girls
rave
when
he
gives
nancy
ellen
money
to
buy
her
outfit
but
they
wo
dare
let
him
hear
a
whisper
of
it
they
take
it
all
out
on
mother
and
she
be
afraid
to
tell
him
afraid
mother
afraid
of
him
not
on
your
life
she
is
hand
in
glove
with
him
she
thinks
as
he
does
and
helps
him
in
everything
he
undertakes
that
so
too
come
to
think
of
it
she
is
a
particle
afraid
of
him
she
agrees
with
him
perfectly
it
would
be
interesting
to
hear
them
having
a
private
conversation
they
never
talk
a
word
before
us
but
they
always
agree
and
they
heartily
agree
on
nancy
ellen
man
that
is
plainly
to
be
seen
it
will
make
a
very
difficult
winter
for
you
katherine
said
agatha
when
nancy
ellen
becomes
interested
in
dresses
and
table
linen
and
bedding
she
will
want
to
sew
all
the
time
and
leave
the
cooking
and
dishes
for
you
as
well
as
your
schoolwork
kate
turned
toward
agatha
in
surprise
but
i
wo
be
there
i
told
you
i
had
taken
a
school
you
taken
a
school
shouted
adam
why
did
they
tell
you
that
father
has
signed
up
for
the
home
school
for
you
good
heavens
said
kate
what
will
be
to
pay
now
did
you
contract
for
another
school
cried
adam
i
surely
did
said
kate
slowly
i
signed
an
agreement
to
teach
the
village
school
in
walden
it
a
brick
building
with
a
janitor
to
sweep
and
watch
fires
only
a
few
blocks
to
walk
and
it
pays
twenty
dollars
a
month
more
than
the
home
school
where
you
can
wade
snow
three
miles
build
your
own
fires
and
freeze
all
day
in
a
little
frame
building
at
that
i
teach
the
school
i
have
taken
and
throw
our
school
out
of
a
teacher
father
could
be
sued
and
probably
will
be
said
adam
and
throw
the
housework
nancy
ellen
expected
you
to
do
on
her
said
agatha
at
the
same
time
i
see
said
kate
well
if
he
is
sued
he
will
have
to
settle
he
would
help
me
a
penny
to
go
to
school
i
am
of
age
the
debt
is
my
own
and
i
do
owe
it
to
him
he
had
all
my
work
has
been
worth
all
my
life
and
i
surely
paid
my
way
i
shall
teach
the
school
i
have
signed
for
you
will
get
into
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
said
adam
agatha
will
you
sell
me
your
telescope
for
what
you
paid
for
it
and
get
yourself
a
new
one
the
next
time
you
go
to
hartley
it
is
only
a
few
days
until
time
to
go
to
my
school
it
opens
sooner
than
in
the
country
and
closes
later
the
term
is
four
months
longer
so
i
earn
that
much
more
i
have
gotten
a
telescope
yet
you
can
add
it
to
my
first
payment
you
may
take
it
said
agatha
but
had
you
better
reconsider
katherine
things
are
progressing
so
nicely
and
this
will
upset
everything
for
nancy
ellen
that
taking
the
home
school
will
upset
everything
for
me
does
seem
to
count
it
is
late
late
to
find
teachers
and
i
can
be
held
responsible
if
i
break
the
contract
i
have
made
father
can
stand
the
racket
better
than
i
can
when
he
would
consent
to
my
going
he
had
no
business
to
make
plans
for
me
i
had
to
make
my
own
plans
and
go
in
spite
of
him
he
might
have
known
i
do
all
in
my
power
to
get
a
school
besides
i
do
want
the
home
school
or
the
home
work
piled
on
me
my
hands
look
like
a
human
being
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
then
i
need
all
my
time
outside
of
school
to
study
and
map
out
lessons
i
am
going
to
try
for
a
room
in
the
hartley
schools
next
year
or
the
next
after
that
surely
they
change
my
plans
and
boss
me
i
am
going
to
be
free
to
work
and
study
and
help
myself
like
other
teachers
a
grand
row
this
will
be
commented
young
adam
and
as
usual
kate
will
be
right
while
all
of
them
will
be
trying
to
use
her
to
their
advantage
ma
has
done
her
share
now
it
is
your
turn
pa
ai
you
going
to
go
over
and
help
her
what
could
i
do
demanded
his
father
the
mischief
is
done
now
well
if
you
ca
do
anything
to
help
you
can
let
me
have
the
buggy
to
drive
her
to
walden
if
they
turn
her
out
invite
her
to
proceed
to
her
destination
you
mean
son
said
agatha
yes
ma
that
is
exactly
what
i
mean
said
young
adam
do
i
get
the
buggy
yes
you
may
take
my
private
conveyance
but
do
nothing
to
publish
the
fact
there
is
no
need
to
incur
antagonism
if
it
can
be
avoided
kate
i
be
driving
past
the
privet
bush
about
nine
in
the
morning
if
you
need
me
hang
a
white
rag
on
it
and
i
stop
at
the
corner
of
the
orchard
i
shall
probably
be
standing
in
the
road
waiting
for
you
said
kate
oh
i
hope
not
said
agatha
looks
remarkably
like
it
to
me
said
kate
then
she
picked
up
the
telescope
said
to
each
of
them
and
in
acute
misery
started
back
to
her
home
this
time
she
followed
the
footpath
beside
the
highway
she
was
so
busy
with
her
indignant
thought
that
she
forgot
to
protect
her
skirts
from
the
dust
of
wayside
weeds
while
in
her
excitement
she
walked
so
fast
her
face
was
red
and
perspiring
when
she
approached
the
church
oh
dear
i
do
know
about
it
said
kate
to
the
small
silent
building
i
am
trying
to
follow
your
advice
but
it
seems
to
me
that
life
is
very
difficult
any
way
you
go
at
it
if
it
is
one
thing
it
is
another
an
hour
ago
i
was
the
happiest
i
have
ever
been
in
my
life
only
look
at
me
now
any
one
who
wants
wings
of
may
have
them
for
all
of
me
it
seems
definitely
settled
that
i
walk
carry
a
load
and
fight
for
the
chance
to
do
even
that
a
big
tear
rolled
down
either
side
of
kate
nose
and
her
face
twisted
in
for
an
instant
but
when
she
came
in
sight
of
home
her
shoulders
squared
the
of
her
eyes
deepened
to
steel
and
her
lips
set
in
a
line
that
was
an
exact
counterpart
of
her
father
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
and
was
ready
to
drive
his
family
with
their
consent
or
without
it
as
she
passed
the
vegetable
garden
there
was
no
time
or
room
for
flowers
in
a
bates
garden
kate
looking
ahead
could
see
nancy
ellen
and
robert
gray
beneath
the
cherry
trees
she
hoped
nancy
ellen
would
see
that
she
was
tired
and
dusty
and
should
have
time
to
brush
and
make
herself
more
presentable
to
meet
a
stranger
and
so
nancy
ellen
did
for
which
reason
she
immediately
arose
and
came
to
the
gate
followed
by
her
suitor
whom
she
at
once
introduced
kate
was
in
no
mood
for
words
one
glance
at
her
proved
to
robert
gray
that
she
was
tired
and
dusty
that
there
were
tear
marks
dried
on
her
face
they
hastily
shook
hands
but
neither
mentioned
the
previous
meeting
excusing
herself
kate
went
into
the
house
saying
she
would
soon
return
nancy
ellen
glanced
at
robert
and
saw
the
look
of
concern
on
his
face
i
believe
she
has
been
crying
she
said
and
if
she
has
something
new
for
i
never
saw
a
tear
on
her
face
before
in
my
life
truly
he
questioned
in
amazement
why
of
course
the
bates
family
are
not
weepers
so
i
have
heard
said
the
man
rather
dryly
nancy
ellen
resented
his
tone
would
you
like
us
better
if
we
were
i
could
like
you
better
than
i
do
but
because
of
what
i
have
heard
and
seen
it
naturally
makes
me
wonder
what
could
have
happened
that
has
made
her
cry
we
are
rather
outspoken
and
not
at
all
secretive
said
nancy
ellen
carelessly
you
will
soon
know
kate
followed
the
walk
around
the
house
and
entered
at
the
side
door
finding
her
father
and
mother
in
the
dining
room
reading
the
weekly
papers
her
mother
glanced
up
as
she
entered
what
did
you
bring
agatha
telescope
back
with
you
for
she
instantly
demanded
for
a
second
kate
hesitated
it
had
to
come
she
might
as
well
get
it
over
possibly
it
would
be
easier
with
them
alone
than
if
nancy
ellen
were
present
it
is
mine
she
said
it
represents
my
first
purchase
on
my
own
hook
and
line
you
are
not
very
choicy
to
begin
on
stuff
nancy
ellen
would
have
had
a
new
one
no
doubt
said
kate
but
this
will
do
for
me
her
father
lowered
his
paper
and
asked
harshly
what
did
you
buy
that
thing
for
kate
gripped
the
handle
and
braced
herself
to
pack
my
clothes
in
when
i
go
to
my
school
next
week
she
said
simply
what
he
shouted
what
cried
her
mother
i
do
know
why
you
seem
surprised
said
kate
surely
you
knew
i
went
to
normal
to
prepare
myself
to
teach
did
you
think
i
find
a
school
now
look
here
young
woman
shouted
adam
bates
you
are
done
taking
the
bit
in
your
teeth
nancy
ellen
is
not
going
to
teach
this
winter
i
have
taken
the
home
school
for
you
you
will
teach
it
that
is
settled
i
have
signed
the
contract
it
must
be
fulfilled
then
nancy
ellen
will
have
to
fulfill
it
said
kate
i
also
have
signed
a
contract
that
must
be
fulfilled
i
am
of
age
and
you
had
no
authority
from
me
to
sign
a
contract
for
me
for
an
instant
kate
thought
there
was
danger
that
the
purple
rush
of
blood
to
her
father
head
might
kill
him
he
opened
his
mouth
but
no
distinct
words
came
her
face
paled
with
fright
but
she
was
of
his
blood
so
she
faced
him
quietly
her
mother
was
quicker
of
wit
and
sharper
of
tongue
where
did
you
get
a
school
why
did
you
wait
until
you
got
home
she
demanded
i
am
going
to
teach
the
village
school
in
walden
said
kate
it
is
a
brick
building
has
a
janitor
i
can
board
reasonably
near
my
work
and
i
get
twenty
dollars
more
a
month
than
our
school
pays
while
the
term
is
four
months
longer
well
it
is
a
pity
about
that
but
it
makes
no
difference
said
her
mother
our
home
school
has
got
to
be
taught
as
pa
contracted
and
nancy
ellen
has
got
to
have
her
chance
what
about
my
chance
asked
kate
evenly
not
one
of
the
girls
even
exceptional
ability
ever
had
as
good
a
school
or
as
high
wages
to
start
on
if
i
do
well
there
this
winter
i
am
sure
i
can
get
in
the
hartley
graded
schools
next
fall
do
you
dare
nickname
your
sister
cried
bates
shrilly
you
stop
your
impudence
and
mind
your
father
ma
you
leave
this
to
me
said
adam
bates
thickly
then
he
glared
at
kate
as
he
arose
stretching
himself
to
full
height
you
signed
a
contract
for
a
school
he
demanded
i
have
said
kate
why
did
you
wait
until
you
got
home
and
talked
it
over
with
us
he
questioned
i
went
to
you
to
talk
over
the
subject
to
going
said
kate
you
would
not
even
allow
me
to
speak
how
was
i
to
know
that
you
would
have
the
slightest
interest
in
what
school
i
took
or
where
when
did
you
sign
this
contract
he
continued
yesterday
afternoon
in
hartley
said
kate
aha
then
i
did
miss
a
letter
from
my
pocket
when
did
you
get
to
be
a
thief
he
demanded
oh
father
cried
kate
it
was
my
letter
i
could
see
my
name
on
the
envelope
i
asked
you
for
it
before
i
took
it
from
behind
my
back
like
the
you
are
you
are
not
fit
to
teach
in
a
school
where
half
the
scholars
are
the
children
of
your
brothers
and
sisters
and
you
are
not
fit
to
live
with
honest
people
pack
your
things
and
be
off
now
this
afternoon
asked
kate
this
minute
he
cried
all
right
you
will
be
surprised
at
how
quickly
i
can
go
said
kate
she
set
down
the
telescope
and
gathered
a
straw
sunshade
and
an
apron
from
the
hooks
at
the
end
of
the
room
opened
the
dish
cupboard
and
took
out
a
mug
decorated
with
the
pinkest
of
wild
roses
and
the
reddest
and
fattest
of
robins
bearing
the
inscription
in
gold
for
a
good
girl
on
a
banner
in
its
beak
kate
smiled
at
it
grimly
as
she
took
the
telescope
and
ran
upstairs
it
was
the
work
of
only
a
few
minutes
to
gather
her
books
and
clothing
and
pack
the
big
telescope
then
she
went
down
the
front
stairs
and
left
the
house
by
the
front
door
carrying
in
her
hand
everything
she
possessed
on
earth
as
she
went
down
the
walk
nancy
ellen
sprang
up
and
ran
to
her
while
robert
gray
followed
you
have
to
talk
to
me
on
the
road
said
kate
i
am
forbidden
the
house
which
also
means
the
grounds
i
suppose
she
walked
across
the
road
set
the
telescope
on
the
grass
under
a
big
elm
tree
and
sat
down
beside
it
i
find
i
am
rather
tired
she
said
will
you
share
the
sofa
with
me
nancy
ellen
lifted
her
pink
skirt
and
sat
beside
kate
robert
gray
stood
looking
down
at
them
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
asked
nancy
ellen
you
know
of
course
that
father
signed
a
contract
for
me
to
teach
the
home
school
this
winter
explained
kate
well
i
am
of
age
and
he
had
no
authority
from
me
so
his
contract
is
legal
none
of
you
would
lift
a
finger
to
help
me
get
away
to
normal
how
was
i
to
know
that
you
would
take
any
interest
in
finding
me
a
school
while
i
was
gone
i
thought
it
was
all
up
to
me
so
i
applied
for
the
school
in
walden
got
it
and
signed
the
contract
to
teach
it
it
is
a
better
school
at
higher
wages
i
thought
you
would
teach
here
i
ca
break
my
contract
father
is
furious
and
has
ordered
me
out
of
the
house
so
there
you
are
or
rather
here
i
am
well
it
is
much
of
a
joke
said
nancy
ellen
thinking
intently
what
she
might
have
said
had
they
been
alone
kate
always
wondered
what
she
did
say
while
her
betrothed
looked
at
her
with
indignant
eyes
was
possibly
another
matter
it
proved
to
be
merely
oh
kate
i
am
so
sorry
so
am
i
said
kate
if
i
had
known
what
your
plans
were
of
course
i
should
gladly
have
helped
you
out
if
only
you
had
written
me
and
told
me
i
wanted
to
surprise
you
said
nancy
ellen
you
have
said
kate
enough
to
last
a
lifetime
i
do
see
how
you
figured
you
knew
how
late
it
was
you
knew
it
would
be
nip
and
tuck
if
i
got
a
school
at
all
of
course
we
did
we
thought
you
could
possibly
get
one
this
late
so
we
fixed
up
the
scheme
to
let
you
have
my
school
and
let
me
sew
on
my
linen
this
winter
we
thought
you
would
be
as
pleased
as
we
were
i
am
too
sorry
for
words
said
kate
if
i
had
known
your
plan
i
would
have
followed
it
even
though
i
gave
up
a
better
school
at
a
higher
salary
but
i
did
know
i
thought
i
had
to
paddle
my
own
canoe
so
i
made
my
own
plans
now
i
must
live
up
to
them
because
my
contract
is
legal
while
father
is
not
i
would
have
taught
the
school
for
you
in
the
circumstances
but
since
i
ca
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
arrangement
i
have
made
is
much
better
the
thing
that
really
hurts
the
worst
aside
from
disappointing
you
is
that
father
says
i
was
not
honest
in
what
i
did
but
what
did
you
do
cried
nancy
ellen
so
kate
told
them
exactly
what
she
had
done
of
course
you
had
a
right
to
your
own
letter
when
you
could
see
the
address
on
it
and
it
was
where
you
could
pick
it
up
said
robert
gray
kate
lifted
dull
eyes
to
his
face
thank
you
for
so
much
grace
at
any
rate
she
said
i
do
blame
you
a
bit
said
nancy
ellen
in
the
same
place
have
taken
it
myself
you
would
have
had
to
said
kate
i
too
abrupt
too
much
like
the
gentleman
himself
you
would
have
asked
him
in
a
way
that
would
have
secured
you
the
letter
with
no
trouble
nancy
ellen
highly
appreciated
these
words
of
praise
before
her
lover
she
arose
immediately
maybe
i
could
do
something
with
him
now
she
said
i
go
and
see
you
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
kate
i
am
as
much
bates
as
he
is
i
wo
be
taunted
afterward
that
he
turned
me
out
and
that
i
sent
you
to
him
to
plead
for
me
i
tell
him
you
did
want
me
to
come
that
i
came
of
my
own
accord
offered
nancy
ellen
and
he
wo
believe
you
said
kate
would
you
consent
for
me
to
go
asked
robert
gray
certainly
not
i
can
look
out
for
myself
what
shall
you
do
asked
nancy
ellen
anxiously
that
is
getting
slightly
ahead
of
me
said
kate
if
i
had
been
diplomatic
i
could
have
evaded
this
until
morning
adam
is
to
be
over
then
prepared
to
take
me
anywhere
i
want
to
go
what
i
have
to
face
now
is
a
way
to
spend
the
night
without
letting
the
neighbours
know
that
i
am
turned
out
how
can
i
manage
that
nancy
ellen
and
robert
each
began
making
suggestions
but
kate
preferred
to
solve
her
own
problems
i
think
she
said
that
i
shall
hide
the
telescope
under
the
privet
bush
there
is
going
to
be
rain
and
then
i
will
go
down
to
hiram
and
stay
all
night
and
watch
for
adam
when
he
passes
in
the
morning
hiram
always
grumbles
because
we
do
come
oftener
then
we
will
go
with
you
said
nancy
ellen
it
will
be
a
pleasant
evening
walk
and
we
can
keep
you
company
and
pacify
my
twin
brother
at
the
same
time
so
they
all
walked
to
the
adjoining
farm
on
the
south
and
when
nancy
ellen
and
robert
were
ready
to
start
back
kate
said
she
was
tired
and
she
believed
she
would
stay
until
morning
which
was
agreeable
to
hiram
and
his
wife
a
girlhood
friend
of
kate
as
nancy
ellen
and
robert
walked
back
toward
home
how
is
this
going
to
come
out
he
asked
anxiously
it
will
come
out
all
right
said
nancy
ellen
serenely
kate
a
particle
of
tact
she
is
father
himself
all
over
again
it
will
come
out
this
way
he
will
tell
me
that
kate
has
gone
back
on
him
and
i
shall
have
to
teach
the
school
and
i
will
say
that
is
the
only
solution
and
the
best
thing
to
do
then
i
shall
talk
all
evening
about
how
provoking
it
is
and
how
i
hate
to
change
my
plans
and
say
i
am
afraid
i
shall
lose
you
if
i
have
to
put
off
our
wedding
to
teach
the
school
and
things
like
that
nancy
ellen
turned
a
flushed
sparkling
face
to
robert
smiling
quizzically
and
i
shall
go
early
to
see
serena
woodruff
who
is
a
fine
scholar
and
a
good
teacher
but
missed
her
school
in
the
spring
by
being
so
sick
she
was
afraid
to
contract
for
it
she
is
all
right
now
and
she
will
be
delighted
to
have
the
school
and
when
i
know
she
will
take
it
then
i
shall
just
happen
to
think
of
her
in
a
day
or
two
and
i
suggest
her
after
wailed
a
lot
more
and
father
will
go
to
see
her
of
his
own
accord
and
it
will
all
be
settled
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
chunk
only
i
shall
not
get
on
so
fast
with
my
sewing
because
of
having
to
help
mother
but
i
shall
do
my
best
and
everything
will
be
all
right
the
spot
was
secluded
robert
gray
stopped
to
tell
nancy
ellen
what
a
wonderful
girl
she
was
he
said
he
was
rather
afraid
of
such
diplomacy
he
foresaw
clearly
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
managed
man
nancy
ellen
told
him
of
course
he
was
all
men
were
the
thing
was
not
to
let
them
know
it
then
they
laughed
and
listened
to
a
wood
robin
singing
out
his
little
heart
in
an
evening
song
that
was
almost
as
melodious
as
his
spring
performances
had
been
chapter
v
the
prodigal
daughter
early
in
the
morning
kate
set
her
young
nephew
on
the
to
watch
for
his
cousin
and
he
was
to
have
a
penny
for
calling
at
his
approach
when
his
lusty
shout
came
kate
said
to
her
paid
the
penny
kissed
the
baby
and
was
standing
in
the
road
when
adam
stopped
he
looked
at
her
inquiringly
well
it
happened
she
said
he
turned
me
out
instanter
with
no
remarks
about
when
i
might
return
if
ever
while
mother
cordially
seconded
the
motion
it
a
good
thing
adam
that
you
offered
to
take
care
of
me
because
i
see
clearly
that
you
are
going
to
have
it
to
do
of
course
i
will
said
adam
promptly
and
of
course
i
can
do
you
want
to
go
to
hartley
for
anything
because
if
you
do
we
can
cut
across
from
the
next
road
and
get
to
walden
in
about
fifteen
miles
while
it
seventeen
by
hartley
but
if
you
want
to
go
we
can
for
i
need
hurry
i
got
a
box
of
lunch
and
a
feed
for
my
horse
in
the
back
of
the
buggy
mother
said
i
was
to
stay
with
you
until
i
saw
you
settled
in
your
room
if
you
had
to
go
and
if
you
do
she
is
angry
with
grandpa
and
she
is
going
to
give
him
a
portion
of
her
mentality
the
very
first
time
she
comes
in
contact
with
him
she
said
so
yes
i
can
almost
hear
her
said
kate
struggling
to
choke
down
a
rising
laugh
she
will
never
know
how
i
appreciate
what
she
has
done
for
me
but
i
think
talking
to
father
will
not
do
any
good
home
been
so
overly
pleasant
it
been
a
small
dark
cramped
house
dingy
and
hot
when
it
might
have
been
big
airy
and
comfortable
well
furnished
and
pretty
as
father
means
would
allow
and
as
all
the
neighbours
always
criticize
him
for
not
having
it
it
meant
hard
work
and
plenty
of
it
ever
since
i
was
set
to
scouring
the
tinware
with
rushes
at
the
mature
age
of
four
but
it
been
home
all
the
home
i
have
had
and
it
hurts
more
than
i
can
tell
you
to
be
ordered
out
of
it
as
i
was
but
if
i
do
well
and
make
a
big
success
maybe
he
will
let
me
come
back
for
christmas
or
next
summer
vacation
if
he
wo
ma
said
you
could
come
to
our
house
said
adam
that
kind
of
her
but
i
could
do
it
said
kate
she
said
you
could
persisted
the
boy
but
if
i
did
it
and
father
got
as
mad
as
he
was
last
night
and
tore
up
your
father
deed
then
where
would
i
be
asked
kate
you
be
a
sixteenth
of
two
hundred
acres
better
off
than
you
are
now
said
adam
possibly
laughed
kate
but
i
would
want
to
become
a
land
shark
that
way
look
down
the
road
who
is
it
asked
adam
nancy
ellen
with
my
telescope
answered
kate
i
am
to
go
all
right
all
right
then
we
will
go
said
the
boy
angrily
but
it
is
a
blame
shame
and
there
is
no
sense
to
it
as
good
a
girl
as
you
have
been
and
the
way
you
have
worked
mother
said
at
breakfast
there
was
neither
sense
nor
justice
in
the
way
grandpa
always
has
acted
and
she
said
she
would
wager
all
she
was
worth
that
he
would
live
to
regret
it
she
said
it
was
natural
and
when
people
undertook
to
controvert
ai
that
a
peach
bet
there
is
a
woman
in
ten
miles
using
that
word
except
ma
nature
they
always
hurt
themselves
worse
than
they
hurt
their
victims
and
i
bet
he
does
too
and
i
for
one
do
care
i
hope
he
does
get
a
good
jolt
just
to
pay
him
up
for
being
so
mean
do
adam
do
cautioned
kate
i
mean
it
cried
the
boy
i
know
you
do
that
the
awful
thing
about
it
said
kate
i
am
afraid
every
girl
he
has
feels
the
same
way
and
from
what
your
father
said
yesterday
even
the
sons
he
favours
do
feel
any
too
good
toward
him
you
just
bet
they
do
they
are
every
one
as
sore
as
boiled
owls
pa
said
so
and
he
knows
for
they
all
talk
it
over
every
time
they
meet
he
said
they
did
feel
like
men
they
felt
like
a
lot
of
they
need
worry
said
kate
every
deed
is
made
out
father
reads
them
over
whenever
it
rains
they
all
get
their
land
when
he
dies
it
is
only
his
way
yes
and
this
is
only
his
way
too
and
it
a
dern
poor
way
said
adam
pa
is
going
to
do
this
way
at
all
mother
said
he
could
go
and
live
on
his
land
and
she
stay
home
with
susan
and
me
if
he
tried
it
and
when
i
am
a
man
i
am
going
to
do
just
like
pa
and
ma
because
they
are
the
rightest
people
i
know
only
i
am
not
going
to
save
quite
so
close
as
pa
and
if
i
died
for
it
i
never
could
converse
or
dance
like
ma
i
should
hope
not
said
kate
and
then
added
hastily
it
all
right
for
a
lady
but
it
would
seem
rather
sissy
for
a
man
i
believe
yes
i
guess
it
would
but
it
is
language
let
me
tell
you
when
ma
cuts
loose
said
adam
hello
nancy
ellen
said
kate
as
adam
stopped
the
buggy
put
my
telescope
in
the
back
with
the
horse
feed
since
you
have
it
i
need
ask
whether
i
am
the
prodigal
daughter
or
not
i
see
clearly
i
am
nancy
ellen
was
worried
until
she
was
pale
kate
she
said
i
never
have
seen
father
so
angry
in
all
my
life
i
thought
last
night
that
in
a
day
or
two
i
could
switch
the
school
over
to
serena
woodruff
and
go
on
with
my
plans
but
father
said
at
breakfast
if
the
bates
name
was
to
stand
for
anything
approaching
honour
a
bates
would
teach
that
school
this
winter
or
he
know
the
reason
why
and
you
know
how
easy
it
is
to
change
him
oh
kate
wo
you
see
if
that
walden
trustee
ca
possibly
find
another
teacher
and
let
you
off
i
know
robert
will
be
disappointed
for
rented
his
office
and
bought
a
house
and
he
said
last
night
to
get
ready
as
soon
after
christmas
as
i
could
oh
kate
wo
you
see
if
you
ca
possibly
get
that
man
to
hire
another
teacher
why
nancy
ellen
said
kate
nancy
ellen
with
a
twitching
face
looked
at
kate
if
robert
has
to
wait
months
there
in
hartley
handsome
as
he
is
and
he
has
to
be
nice
to
everybody
to
get
practice
and
you
know
how
those
hartley
girls
are
yes
nancy
ellen
i
know
said
kate
i
see
what
i
can
do
is
it
understood
that
if
i
give
up
the
school
and
come
back
and
take
ours
father
will
let
me
come
home
yes
oh
yes
cried
nancy
ellen
well
nothing
goes
on
i
hear
him
say
it
myself
said
kate
she
climbed
from
the
buggy
nancy
ellen
caught
her
arm
do
go
in
there
do
you
go
there
she
cried
he
throw
the
first
thing
he
can
pick
up
at
you
mother
says
he
has
been
asleep
all
night
pooh
said
kate
how
childish
i
want
to
hear
him
say
that
and
he
scarcely
kill
me
she
walked
swiftly
to
the
side
door
father
she
said
nancy
ellen
is
afraid
she
will
lose
robert
gray
if
she
has
to
put
off
her
marriage
for
months
kate
stepped
back
quickly
as
a
chair
crashed
against
the
door
facing
she
again
came
into
view
and
continued
so
she
asked
me
if
i
would
get
out
of
my
school
and
come
back
if
i
could
kate
dodged
another
chair
when
she
appeared
again
to
save
the
furniture
of
which
we
have
none
too
much
i
just
step
inside
she
said
when
her
father
started
toward
her
she
started
around
the
dining
table
talking
as
fast
as
she
could
he
lunging
after
her
like
a
furious
bull
she
asked
me
to
come
back
and
teach
the
school
to
keep
her
from
putting
off
her
wedding
because
she
is
afraid
to
if
i
can
break
my
contract
there
may
i
come
back
and
help
her
out
here
the
pace
was
going
more
swiftly
each
round
it
was
punctuated
at
that
instant
by
a
heavy
meat
platter
aimed
at
kate
head
she
saw
it
picked
up
and
swayed
so
it
missed
i
guess
that
is
answer
enough
for
me
she
panted
racing
on
a
lovely
father
you
are
no
wonder
your
daughters
are
dishonest
through
fear
of
you
no
wonder
your
wife
has
no
mind
of
her
own
no
wonder
your
sons
hate
you
and
wish
you
would
die
so
they
could
have
their
deeds
and
be
like
men
instead
of
as
they
feel
now
no
wonder
the
whole
posse
of
us
hate
you
directly
opposite
the
door
kate
caught
the
table
and
drew
it
with
her
to
bar
the
opening
as
it
crashed
against
the
casing
half
the
dishes
flew
to
the
floor
in
a
heap
when
adam
bates
pulled
it
from
his
path
he
stepped
in
a
dish
of
fried
potatoes
and
fell
heavily
kate
reached
the
road
climbed
in
the
buggy
and
said
the
nancy
ellen
better
hide
cut
a
bundle
of
stuff
and
send
it
to
me
by
adam
and
sew
my
fingers
to
the
bone
for
you
every
night
now
drive
like
sin
adam
as
adam
bates
came
lurching
down
the
walk
in
fury
the
buggy
dashed
past
and
kate
had
not
even
time
to
turn
her
head
to
see
what
happened
take
the
first
turn
she
said
to
adam
i
done
an
awful
thing
what
did
you
do
cried
the
boy
asked
him
as
nicely
as
i
could
but
he
threw
a
chair
at
me
something
funny
happened
to
me
and
i
was
afraid
of
him
at
all
i
dodged
it
and
finished
what
i
was
saying
and
another
chair
came
so
the
two
bates
went
at
it
oh
kate
what
did
you
do
cried
adam
went
inside
and
ran
around
the
dining
table
while
i
told
him
what
all
his
sons
and
daughters
think
of
him
and
all
did
you
tell
him
my
father
said
that
he
demanded
no
i
had
more
sense
left
than
that
said
kate
i
only
said
all
his
boys
felt
like
that
then
i
pulled
the
table
after
me
to
block
the
door
and
smashed
half
the
dishes
and
he
slipped
in
the
fried
potatoes
and
went
down
with
a
crash
bloody
murder
cried
young
adam
aghast
me
too
said
kate
i
never
step
in
that
house
again
while
he
lives
i
spilled
the
beans
now
that
you
have
said
adam
slacking
his
horse
to
glance
back
he
is
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
shaking
his
fist
after
you
can
you
see
nancy
ellen
asked
kate
no
she
must
have
climbed
the
garden
fence
and
hidden
behind
the
privet
bush
well
she
better
make
it
a
good
long
hide
until
he
has
had
plenty
of
time
to
cool
off
he
have
killed
me
if
he
had
caught
me
after
he
fell
and
wasted
all
those
potatoes
already
cooked
kate
laughed
a
dry
hysterical
laugh
but
the
boy
sat
and
awed
never
mind
said
kate
seeing
how
frightened
he
was
when
he
has
had
plenty
of
time
he
cool
off
but
he
never
get
over
it
i
hope
he
does
beat
mother
because
i
was
born
oh
drat
such
a
man
said
young
adam
i
hope
something
worse
that
this
happens
to
him
if
ever
i
see
father
begin
to
be
the
least
bit
like
him
as
he
grows
older
i
shall
well
what
shall
you
do
asked
kate
as
he
paused
tell
ma
cried
young
adam
emphatically
kate
leaned
her
face
in
her
hands
and
laughed
when
she
could
speak
she
said
do
you
know
adam
i
think
that
would
be
the
very
best
thing
you
could
do
why
of
course
said
adam
they
drove
swiftly
and
reached
walden
before
ten
there
they
inquired
their
way
to
the
home
of
the
trustee
but
kate
said
nothing
about
giving
up
the
school
she
merely
made
a
few
inquiries
asked
for
the
key
of
the
schoolhouse
and
about
boarding
places
she
was
directed
to
four
among
which
she
might
choose
where
would
you
advise
me
to
go
she
asked
the
trustee
well
now
folks
differ
said
he
all
those
folks
is
neighbours
of
mine
and
some
might
like
one
and
some
might
like
another
best
i
could
say
this
i
think
means
would
be
the
cheapest
knowls
the
dearest
but
the
last
teacher
was
a
good
one
an
she
seemed
well
satisfied
with
the
widder
holt
i
see
said
kate
smiling
then
she
and
young
adam
investigated
the
schoolhouse
and
found
it
far
better
than
any
either
of
them
had
ever
been
inside
it
promised
every
comfort
and
convenience
compared
with
schools
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
so
they
returned
the
keys
inquired
about
the
cleaning
of
the
building
and
started
out
to
find
a
boarding
place
first
they
went
to
the
cheapest
but
it
could
be
seen
at
a
glance
that
it
was
too
cheap
so
they
eliminated
that
then
they
went
to
the
most
expensive
but
it
was
obvious
from
the
house
and
grounds
that
board
there
would
be
more
than
kate
would
want
to
pay
i
like
to
save
my
digestion
and
have
a
place
in
which
to
study
where
i
wo
freeze
said
kate
but
i
want
to
board
as
cheaply
as
i
can
this
morning
changes
my
plans
materially
i
shall
want
to
go
to
school
next
summer
part
of
the
time
but
the
part
i
do
not
i
shall
have
to
pay
my
way
so
i
must
spend
money
as
i
thought
i
would
not
one
of
you
will
dare
be
caught
doing
a
thing
for
me
to
make
you
safe
i
stay
away
but
it
will
cost
me
money
that
i
hoped
to
have
for
clothes
like
other
girls
it
too
bad
said
adam
but
i
stick
to
you
and
so
will
ma
of
course
you
will
you
dear
boy
said
kate
now
let
try
our
third
place
it
is
not
far
from
here
soon
they
found
the
house
but
kate
stopped
short
on
sight
of
it
adam
there
has
been
little
in
life
to
make
me
particular
she
said
but
i
draw
the
line
at
that
house
i
would
go
crazy
in
a
house
painted
bright
red
with
brown
and
blue
decoration
it
should
be
prohibited
by
law
let
us
hunt
up
the
widder
holt
and
see
how
her
taste
in
colour
runs
the
joke
is
on
you
said
adam
when
they
had
found
the
house
it
was
near
the
school
on
a
wide
shady
street
across
which
big
maples
locked
branches
there
was
a
large
lot
filled
with
old
fruit
trees
and
long
grass
with
a
garden
at
the
back
the
house
was
old
and
low
having
a
small
porch
in
front
but
if
it
ever
had
seen
paint
it
did
not
show
it
at
that
time
it
was
a
warm
linty
gray
the
shingles
of
the
old
roof
almost
the
joke
is
on
me
said
kate
i
shall
have
no
quarrel
with
the
paint
here
and
will
you
look
at
that
adam
looked
where
kate
pointed
across
the
street
and
nodded
that
ought
to
be
put
in
a
gold
frame
he
said
i
think
so
too
said
kate
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
i
stay
where
i
can
see
it
they
were
talking
of
a
deep
gully
facing
the
house
and
running
to
a
levee
where
the
street
crossed
a
stream
ran
down
it
dipped
under
a
culvert
turned
sharply
and
ran
away
to
a
distant
river
spanning
which
they
could
see
the
bridge
tall
old
forest
trees
lined
the
banks
shrubs
and
bushes
grew
in
a
thicket
there
were
swaying
clambering
vines
and
a
babel
of
bird
notes
over
the
seed
and
berry
bearing
bushes
let
go
inside
and
if
we
agree
then
we
will
get
some
water
and
feed
the
horse
and
eat
our
lunch
over
there
said
kate
just
the
thing
said
young
adam
come
and
we
will
proceed
to
the
residence
of
holt
and
investigate
her
possibilities
how
do
you
like
that
that
is
fine
said
kate
gravely
it
is
said
adam
promptly
because
it
is
ma
and
whatever
is
ma
is
right
good
for
you
cried
kate
i
am
going
to
break
a
bates
record
and
kiss
you
when
you
go
i
probably
sha
have
another
in
years
come
on
they
walked
up
the
grassy
wooden
walk
stepped
on
the
tiny
porch
and
lifted
and
dropped
a
rusty
old
iron
knocker
almost
at
once
the
door
opened
to
reveal
a
woman
of
respectable
appearance
a
trifle
past
middle
age
she
made
kate
think
of
dried
sage
because
she
had
a
look
and
her
complexion
hair
and
eyes
were
all
that
colour
she
was
neat
and
clean
while
the
hall
into
which
she
invited
them
was
clean
and
had
a
wholesome
odour
kate
explained
her
errand
holt
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
well
thank
goodness
i
was
she
said
the
teacher
stayed
here
last
year
and
she
was
satisfied
so
i
ast
the
trustee
to
mention
me
to
the
new
teacher
nobody
was
expecting
you
until
the
last
of
the
week
but
i
says
to
myself
take
time
by
the
fetlock
samantha
always
be
ready
so
last
week
i
put
in
scouring
my
spare
room
to
beat
the
nation
and
it
all
ready
so
you
can
walk
right
in
thank
you
said
kate
rather
resenting
the
assumption
that
she
was
to
have
no
option
in
the
matter
i
have
four
places
on
my
list
where
they
want
the
teacher
so
i
thought
i
would
look
at
each
of
them
and
then
decide
my
ai
we
choicey
said
holt
in
sneering
tones
then
she
changed
instantly
and
in
suave
commendation
went
on
that
exactly
right
that
the
very
thing
fer
you
to
do
after
you
have
seen
what
walden
has
to
offer
then
a
pretty
young
thing
like
you
can
make
up
your
mind
where
you
will
have
the
most
quiet
fer
your
work
the
best
room
and
be
best
fed
one
of
the
greatest
advantages
here
fer
a
teacher
is
that
she
can
be
quiet
an
not
have
her
room
rummaged
every
place
else
that
takes
boarders
there
a
lot
of
children
here
there
is
only
me
and
my
son
and
he
is
grown
and
will
be
off
to
his
medical
work
next
week
fer
the
year
so
all
your
working
time
here
you
be
alone
with
me
this
is
the
room
that
surely
would
be
a
great
advantage
because
i
have
much
studying
to
do
said
kate
as
they
entered
the
room
with
one
glance
she
liked
it
it
was
a
large
room
with
low
ceiling
quaintly
papered
in
very
old
creamy
paper
scattered
with
delicately
cut
green
leaves
but
so
carefully
had
the
room
been
kept
that
it
was
still
clean
there
were
four
large
windows
to
let
in
light
and
air
freshly
washed
white
curtains
hanging
over
the
deep
green
shades
the
floor
was
carpeted
with
a
freshly
washed
rag
carpet
stretched
over
straw
the
bed
was
invitingly
clean
and
looked
comfortable
there
was
a
wash
stand
with
bowl
and
pitcher
soap
and
towels
a
small
table
with
a
lamp
a
chair
and
a
rocking
chair
holt
opened
a
large
closet
having
hooks
for
dresses
at
one
end
and
shelves
at
the
other
on
the
top
of
these
there
were
a
comfort
and
a
pair
of
heavy
blankets
your
winter
covers
said
holt
indicating
these
and
there
is
a
good
stove
i
take
out
in
summer
to
make
more
room
and
set
up
as
soon
as
it
gets
cold
and
that
is
a
wood
box
she
pointed
out
a
shoe
box
covered
with
paper
similar
to
that
on
the
walls
kate
examined
the
room
carefully
the
bed
the
closet
and
tried
the
chairs
behind
the
girl
holt
with
compressed
lips
forgetting
adam
presence
watched
in
evident
disapproval
i
want
to
see
the
stove
said
kate
it
is
out
in
the
woodhouse
it
has
been
cleaned
up
for
the
winter
yet
then
it
wo
be
far
away
let
look
at
it
almost
wholly
lacking
experience
kate
was
proceeding
by
instinct
in
exactly
the
same
way
her
father
would
have
taken
through
experience
holt
hesitated
then
turned
oh
very
well
she
said
leading
the
way
down
the
hall
through
the
dining
room
which
was
older
in
furnishing
and
much
more
worn
but
still
clean
and
wholesome
as
were
the
small
kitchen
and
back
porch
from
it
there
was
only
a
step
to
the
woodhouse
where
on
a
little
platform
across
one
end
sat
two
small
stoves
for
burning
wood
one
so
small
as
to
be
tiny
kate
walked
to
the
larger
lifted
the
top
looked
inside
tried
the
dampers
and
drafts
and
turning
said
that
is
very
small
it
will
require
more
wood
than
a
larger
one
holt
indicated
dry
wood
corded
to
the
roof
we
git
all
our
wood
from
the
thicket
across
the
way
that
little
strip
an
this
lot
is
all
we
have
left
of
father
farm
we
kept
this
to
live
on
and
sold
the
rest
for
town
lots
all
except
that
gully
which
we
could
give
away
but
i
must
say
i
like
the
trees
and
birds
better
than
mebby
i
like
people
who
might
live
there
we
always
git
our
wood
from
it
and
the
shade
an
running
water
make
it
the
coolest
place
in
town
yes
i
suppose
they
do
said
kate
she
took
one
long
look
at
everything
as
they
returned
to
the
hall
the
trustee
told
me
your
terms
are
four
dollars
and
fifty
cents
a
week
furnishing
food
and
wood
she
said
and
that
you
allowed
the
last
teacher
to
do
her
own
washing
on
saturday
for
nothing
is
that
right
the
thin
lips
drew
more
tightly
holt
looked
at
kate
from
head
to
foot
in
close
scrutiny
i
could
make
enough
to
pay
the
extra
work
at
that
she
said
i
ought
to
have
a
dollar
more
to
really
come
out
even
i
have
to
say
this
fall
if
that
is
the
case
said
kate
thank
you
very
much
for
showing
me
is
what
i
paid
at
normal
it
is
more
than
i
can
afford
in
a
village
like
this
she
turned
away
followed
by
adam
they
crossed
the
street
watered
the
horse
at
the
stream
placed
his
food
conveniently
for
him
and
taking
their
lunch
box
seated
themselves
on
a
grassy
place
on
the
bank
and
began
eating
was
that
a
pretty
nice
room
asked
adam
did
you
kind
of
hate
to
give
it
up
i
have
the
slightest
intention
of
giving
it
up
answered
kate
that
woman
is
a
and
i
do
propose
to
let
her
beat
me
no
doubt
she
was
glad
to
get
last
fall
she
only
trying
to
see
if
she
can
wring
me
for
a
dollar
more
if
i
have
to
board
all
next
summer
i
shall
have
to
watch
every
penny
or
i
not
come
out
even
let
alone
saving
anything
i
wager
you
a
nickel
that
before
we
leave
she
comes
over
here
and
offers
me
the
room
at
the
same
price
she
got
last
winter
i
hope
you
are
right
said
adam
how
do
you
like
her
got
a
grouch
nasty
temper
mean
disposition
clean
house
good
room
good
cook
maybe
lives
just
on
the
edge
of
comfort
by
daily
skimping
summarized
kate
if
she
comes
are
you
going
to
try
it
asked
adam
yes
i
think
i
shall
it
is
nearest
my
purse
and
requirements
and
if
the
former
teacher
stayed
there
it
will
seem
all
right
for
me
but
she
is
going
to
put
that
little
stove
in
my
room
it
would
heat
the
closet
how
did
you
like
her
not
much
said
adam
promptly
if
glaring
at
your
back
could
have
killed
you
you
would
have
fallen
dead
when
you
examined
the
closet
and
bedding
and
stove
she
honeyed
up
when
she
had
to
but
she
was
mad
as
hops
i
nearly
bursted
right
out
when
she
talked
about
time
by
the
fetlock
i
wanted
to
tell
her
she
looked
like
she
had
and
almost
got
the
life
kicked
out
of
her
doing
it
but
i
thought
better
not
kate
laughed
yes
i
noticed
she
said
but
i
dared
not
look
at
you
i
was
afraid
you
laugh
is
this
a
fine
lunch
bet
your
life
it
is
said
adam
ma
never
puts
up
any
other
kind
i
wish
someone
admired
me
as
much
as
you
do
your
mother
adam
said
kate
well
you
be
as
nice
as
ma
and
somebody
is
sure
to
said
he
but
i
never
could
said
kate
oh
yes
you
could
said
adam
if
you
would
only
set
yourself
to
do
it
and
try
with
all
your
might
to
be
like
her
look
quick
that
must
be
her
course
man
kate
glanced
across
the
way
and
saw
a
man
she
thought
to
be
about
thirty
years
of
age
he
did
not
resemble
his
mother
in
any
particular
if
he
was
the
son
of
holt
he
was
above
the
average
man
in
height
having
broad
rather
stooping
shoulders
dark
hair
and
eyes
he
stopped
at
the
gate
and
stood
a
few
seconds
looking
at
them
so
they
could
not
very
well
study
him
closely
then
he
went
up
the
walk
with
loose
easy
stride
and
entered
the
house
yes
that
is
her
son
said
kate
that
is
exactly
the
way
a
man
enters
a
house
that
belongs
to
him
that
is
the
way
i
am
going
to
enter
my
house
said
adam
now
what
shall
we
do
rest
half
an
hour
while
they
talk
it
over
and
then
get
ready
to
go
very
deliberately
if
she
does
come
across
literally
and
figuratively
we
hunt
another
boarding
place
i
half
believe
she
will
come
said
adam
she
is
watching
us
i
can
see
her
pull
back
the
blind
of
her
room
to
peep
keep
looking
ahead
do
let
her
think
you
see
her
let
go
up
the
creek
and
investigate
this
ravine
is
it
a
lovely
place
yes
i
glad
you
got
it
said
adam
that
is
if
she
come
across
i
will
think
of
you
as
having
it
to
look
at
in
summer
and
this
winter
my
what
rabbit
hunting
there
will
be
and
how
pretty
it
will
look
so
they
went
wandering
up
the
ravine
sometimes
on
one
bank
sometimes
crossing
or
logs
to
the
other
looking
talking
until
a
full
hour
had
passed
when
they
returned
to
the
buggy
adam
began
changing
the
halter
for
the
bridle
while
kate
shook
out
the
lap
robe
nickel
please
whispered
kate
adam
glanced
across
the
street
to
see
holt
coming
she
approached
them
and
with
no
preliminaries
said
i
have
been
telling
my
son
about
you
an
he
hates
so
bad
to
go
away
and
leave
me
alone
for
the
winter
that
he
says
to
take
you
at
the
same
as
the
last
teacher
even
if
i
do
lose
money
on
it
oh
you
would
do
that
holt
said
kate
carelessly
of
course
it
is
for
you
to
decide
i
like
the
room
and
if
the
board
was
right
for
the
other
teacher
it
will
be
for
me
if
you
want
me
to
stay
i
bring
my
things
over
and
take
the
room
at
once
if
not
i
look
farther
come
right
over
said
holt
cordially
i
am
anxious
to
git
on
the
job
of
mothering
such
a
sweet
young
lady
what
will
you
have
for
your
supper
whatever
you
are
having
said
kate
i
am
not
accustomed
to
ordering
my
meals
adam
come
and
help
me
unpack
in
half
an
hour
kate
had
her
dresses
on
the
hooks
her
underclothing
on
the
shelves
her
books
on
the
table
her
pencils
and
pen
in
the
robin
cup
and
was
saying
goodbye
to
adam
and
telling
him
what
to
tell
his
father
mother
and
nancy
ellen
if
he
could
get
a
stolen
interview
with
her
on
the
way
home
he
also
promised
to
write
kate
what
happened
about
the
home
school
and
everything
in
which
she
would
be
interested
then
she
went
back
to
her
room
sat
in
the
comfortable
rocking
chair
and
with
nothing
in
the
world
she
was
obliged
to
do
immediately
she
stared
at
the
opposite
wall
and
day
by
day
reviewed
the
summer
she
sat
so
long
and
stared
at
the
wall
so
intently
that
gradually
it
dissolved
and
shaped
into
the
deep
green
ravine
across
the
way
which
sank
into
soothing
darkness
and
the
slowly
lightened
until
a
peep
of
gold
came
over
the
tree
tops
and
then
a
red
sun
crept
up
having
a
big
wonderful
widespread
wing
on
each
side
of
it
kate
head
fell
with
a
jerk
which
awakened
her
so
she
arose
removed
her
dress
washed
and
brushed
her
hair
put
on
a
fresh
dress
and
taking
a
book
she
crossed
the
street
and
sat
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
again
which
she
watched
instead
of
reading
as
she
had
intended
chapter
vi
kate
private
pupil
at
first
kate
merely
sat
in
a
pleasant
place
and
allowed
her
nerves
to
settle
after
the
short
nap
she
had
enjoyed
in
the
rocking
chair
it
was
such
a
novel
experience
for
her
to
sit
idle
that
despite
the
attractions
of
growing
things
running
water
and
singing
birds
she
soon
veered
to
thoughts
of
what
she
would
be
doing
if
she
were
at
home
and
that
brought
her
to
the
fact
that
she
was
forbidden
her
house
so
if
she
might
not
go
there
she
was
homeless
as
she
had
known
her
father
for
nearly
nineteen
years
for
she
had
a
birth
anniversary
coming
in
a
few
days
she
felt
positive
that
he
never
would
voluntarily
see
her
again
while
with
his
constitution
he
would
live
for
years
she
might
as
well
face
the
fact
that
she
was
homeless
and
prepare
to
pay
her
way
all
the
year
round
she
wondered
why
she
felt
so
forlorn
and
what
made
the
dull
ache
in
her
throat
she
remembered
telling
nancy
ellen
before
going
away
to
normal
that
she
wished
her
father
would
drive
her
from
home
now
that
was
accomplished
she
was
away
from
home
in
a
place
where
there
was
not
one
familiar
face
object
or
plan
of
life
but
she
did
not
wish
for
it
at
all
she
devoutly
wished
that
she
were
back
at
home
even
if
she
were
preparing
supper
in
order
that
nancy
ellen
might
hem
towels
she
wondered
what
they
were
saying
her
mind
was
crystal
clear
as
to
what
they
were
doing
she
wondered
if
nancy
ellen
would
send
adam
with
a
parcel
of
sewing
for
her
to
work
on
she
resolved
to
sew
quickly
and
with
stitches
of
evenness
if
it
came
she
wondered
if
nancy
ellen
would
be
compelled
to
put
off
her
wedding
and
teach
the
home
school
in
order
that
it
might
be
taught
by
a
bates
as
her
father
had
demanded
she
wondered
if
nancy
ellen
was
forced
to
this
uncongenial
task
whether
it
would
sour
the
wonderful
sweetness
developed
by
her
courtship
and
make
her
so
provoked
that
she
would
not
write
or
have
anything
to
do
with
her
they
were
nearly
the
same
age
they
had
shared
rooms
and
until
recently
beds
and
whatever
life
brought
them
now
kate
lifted
her
head
and
ran
her
hand
against
her
throat
to
ease
the
ache
gathering
there
more
intensely
every
minute
with
eyes
that
did
not
see
she
sat
staring
at
the
sheer
walls
of
the
ravine
as
it
ran
toward
the
east
where
the
water
came
tumbling
and
leaping
down
over
stones
and
shale
bed
when
at
last
she
arose
she
had
learned
one
lesson
not
in
the
history
she
carried
no
matter
what
its
disadvantages
are
having
a
home
of
any
kind
is
vastly
preferable
to
having
none
and
the
casualness
of
people
so
driven
by
the
demands
of
living
and
money
making
that
they
do
not
take
time
even
to
be
slightly
courteous
and
kind
no
matter
how
objectionable
it
may
be
still
that
even
that
is
better
than
their
active
displeasure
so
she
sat
brooding
and
going
over
and
over
the
summer
arguing
her
side
of
the
case
honestly
trying
to
see
theirs
until
she
was
mentally
exhausted
and
still
had
accomplished
nothing
further
than
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
if
nancy
ellen
was
forced
to
postpone
her
wedding
she
would
turn
against
her
and
influence
robert
gray
in
the
same
feeling
then
kate
thought
of
him
she
capitalized
him
in
her
thought
for
after
nineteen
years
of
bates
men
robert
gray
would
seem
a
deified
creature
to
their
women
she
reviewed
the
scene
at
the
crossing
log
while
her
face
flushed
with
pleasure
if
she
had
remained
at
home
and
had
gone
after
the
blackberries
as
it
was
sure
as
fate
that
she
would
have
done
then
she
would
have
met
him
first
and
he
would
have
courted
her
instead
of
nancy
ellen
suddenly
kate
shook
herself
savagely
and
sat
straight
why
you
big
fool
she
said
nancy
ellen
went
to
the
berry
patch
in
a
pink
dress
wearing
a
sunbonnet
to
match
and
carrying
a
blue
bowl
think
of
the
picture
she
made
but
if
i
had
gone
have
been
in
a
ragged
old
gingham
father
boots
and
his
old
straw
hat
jammed
down
to
my
ears
i
have
been
hot
and
in
a
surly
temper
rebelling
because
i
had
the
berries
to
pick
he
would
have
taken
one
look
at
me
jumped
the
fence
and
run
to
lang
for
dear
life
better
cut
that
idea
right
out
so
kate
cut
that
idea
out
at
once
but
the
operation
was
painful
because
when
one
turns
mental
surgeon
and
operates
on
the
ugly
spots
in
one
disposition
there
is
no
anaesthetic
nor
is
the
work
done
with
skilful
hands
so
the
wounds
are
numerous
and
leave
ugly
scars
but
kate
was
ruthless
she
resolved
never
to
think
of
that
brook
scene
again
in
life
as
she
had
lived
it
she
would
not
have
profited
by
having
been
first
at
the
berry
patch
yet
she
had
a
right
to
think
of
robert
gray
face
grave
in
concern
for
her
his
offers
to
help
the
influence
he
would
have
in
her
favour
with
nancy
ellen
of
course
if
he
was
forced
to
postpone
his
wedding
he
would
not
be
pleased
but
it
was
impossible
that
the
fears
which
were
tormenting
nancy
ellen
would
materialize
into
action
on
his
part
no
sane
man
loved
a
woman
as
beautiful
as
her
sister
and
cast
her
aside
because
of
a
few
enforced
waiting
the
cause
of
which
he
so
very
well
knew
but
it
would
make
both
of
them
unhappy
and
change
their
beautiful
plans
after
he
even
had
found
and
purchased
the
house
still
nancy
ellen
said
that
her
father
was
making
it
a
point
of
honour
that
a
bates
should
teach
the
school
because
he
had
signed
the
contract
for
kate
to
take
the
place
nancy
ellen
had
intended
to
fill
and
then
changed
her
plans
he
had
sworn
that
a
bates
should
teach
the
school
well
hiram
had
taken
the
county
examination
as
all
pupils
of
the
past
ten
years
had
when
they
finished
the
country
schools
it
was
a
test
required
to
prove
whether
they
had
done
their
work
well
hiram
held
a
certificate
for
a
year
given
him
by
the
county
superintendent
when
he
passed
the
examinations
he
had
never
used
it
he
could
teach
he
was
nancy
ellen
twin
school
did
not
begin
until
the
first
of
november
he
could
hire
help
with
his
corn
if
he
could
not
finish
alone
he
could
arise
earlier
than
usual
and
do
his
feeding
and
milking
he
could
clean
the
stables
haul
wood
on
saturday
and
sunday
if
he
must
for
the
bates
family
looked
on
sunday
more
as
a
day
of
rest
for
the
horses
and
physical
man
than
as
one
of
religious
observances
they
always
worked
if
there
was
anything
to
be
gained
by
it
six
months
being
the
term
he
would
be
free
by
the
first
of
may
surely
the
money
would
be
an
attraction
while
nancy
ellen
could
coach
him
on
any
new
methods
she
had
learned
at
normal
kate
sprang
to
her
feet
ran
across
the
street
and
entering
the
hall
hurried
to
her
room
she
found
holt
there
in
the
act
of
closing
her
closet
door
kate
looked
at
her
with
astonished
eyes
i
was
just
telling
my
son
holt
said
rather
breathlessly
that
i
would
take
a
peep
and
see
if
i
had
forgot
to
put
your
extra
covers
on
the
shelf
kate
threw
her
book
on
the
bed
and
walked
to
the
table
she
had
experienced
her
share
of
battle
for
the
day
no
children
to
rummage
passed
through
her
brain
it
was
the
final
week
of
hot
dry
august
weather
while
a
point
had
been
made
of
calling
her
attention
to
the
extra
cover
when
the
room
had
been
shown
her
she
might
have
said
these
things
but
why
say
them
the
shamed
face
of
the
woman
convicted
her
of
rummaging
as
she
had
termed
it
without
a
word
kate
sat
down
beside
the
table
drew
her
writing
material
before
her
and
began
addressing
an
envelope
to
her
brother
hiram
holt
left
the
room
disliking
kate
more
than
if
she
had
said
what
the
woman
knew
she
thought
kate
wrote
briefly
convincingly
covering
every
objection
and
every
advantage
she
could
conceive
and
then
she
added
the
strongest
plea
she
could
make
what
hiram
would
do
she
had
no
idea
as
with
all
bates
men
land
was
his
god
but
it
required
money
to
improve
it
he
would
feel
timid
about
making
a
first
attempt
to
teach
after
he
was
married
and
a
father
of
a
child
but
nancy
ellen
marriage
would
furnish
plausible
excuse
all
of
the
family
had
done
their
school
work
as
perfectly
as
all
work
they
undertook
he
could
teach
if
he
wanted
to
would
he
want
to
if
he
did
at
least
she
would
be
sure
of
the
continued
friendship
of
her
sister
and
robert
gray
suddenly
kate
understood
what
that
meant
to
her
as
she
had
not
realized
before
she
was
making
long
strides
toward
understanding
herself
which
is
the
most
important
feature
of
any
life
she
sent
a
line
of
pleading
to
her
a
word
of
love
to
the
baby
and
finishing
her
letter
started
to
post
it
as
she
remembered
the
office
was
only
a
few
steps
down
the
street
in
the
hall
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
the
teacher
now
and
so
should
be
an
example
possibly
the
women
of
walden
did
not
run
bareheaded
down
the
street
on
errands
she
laid
the
letter
on
a
small
shelf
of
an
old
hatrack
and
stepped
back
to
her
room
to
put
on
her
hat
her
return
was
so
immediate
that
holt
had
the
letter
in
her
fingers
when
kate
came
back
and
was
reading
the
address
so
intently
that
with
extended
hand
the
girl
said
in
cold
tones
my
letter
please
before
the
woman
realized
she
was
there
their
eyes
met
in
a
level
look
holt
mouth
opened
in
ready
excuse
but
this
time
kate
temper
overcame
her
better
judgment
can
you
read
it
clearly
without
your
glasses
she
asked
politely
i
would
for
the
world
have
you
make
a
mistake
as
to
whom
my
letter
is
addressed
it
goes
to
my
brother
hiram
bates
youngest
son
of
adam
bates
bates
corners
hartley
indiana
i
was
going
to
give
it
to
my
son
so
that
he
could
take
it
to
the
office
said
holt
and
i
am
going
to
take
it
myself
as
i
know
your
son
is
down
town
and
i
want
it
to
go
over
on
the
evening
hack
so
it
will
be
sure
to
go
out
early
in
the
morning
surprise
overcame
holt
discomfiture
land
sakes
she
cried
bates
is
such
a
common
name
it
did
mean
a
thing
to
me
be
you
a
daughter
of
adam
bates
the
land
king
of
bates
corners
i
be
said
kate
tersely
well
i
never
all
them
hundreds
of
acres
of
land
an
money
in
the
bank
an
mortgages
on
half
his
neighbours
whut
the
nation
an
no
more
of
better
clo
an
you
got
an
teachin
school
i
never
heard
of
the
like
in
all
my
days
if
you
have
bates
history
down
so
fine
you
should
know
that
every
girl
of
the
entire
bates
family
has
taught
from
the
time
she
finished
school
until
she
married
also
we
never
buy
more
clothing
than
we
need
or
of
the
kind
not
suitable
for
our
work
this
may
explain
why
we
own
some
land
and
have
a
few
cents
in
the
bank
my
letter
please
kate
turned
and
went
down
the
street
a
dull
red
tingeing
her
face
i
could
hate
that
woman
cordially
without
half
trying
she
said
the
house
was
filled
with
the
odour
of
cooking
food
when
she
returned
and
soon
she
was
called
to
supper
as
she
went
to
the
chair
indicated
for
her
a
step
was
heard
in
the
hall
kate
remained
standing
and
when
a
young
man
entered
the
room
holt
at
once
introduced
her
son
george
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
step
around
the
table
and
shake
hands
but
muttered
a
gruff
howdy
do
and
seating
himself
at
once
picked
up
the
nearest
dish
and
began
filling
his
plate
his
mother
would
have
had
matters
otherwise
why
george
she
chided
what
your
hurry
why
do
you
brush
up
and
wait
on
miss
bates
first
oh
if
she
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
family
he
said
she
will
have
to
learn
to
get
on
without
much
grub
is
to
eat
we
can
all
reach
at
a
table
of
this
size
kate
looked
at
george
holt
with
a
searching
glance
surely
he
was
almost
thirty
of
average
height
appeared
strong
and
as
if
he
might
have
a
forceful
brain
but
he
was
loosely
jointed
and
there
was
a
trace
of
domineering
selfishness
on
his
face
that
was
repulsive
to
her
i
could
hate
that
man
cordially
without
half
trying
she
thought
to
herself
smiling
faintly
at
the
thought
the
sharp
eyes
of
holt
detected
the
smile
she
probably
would
have
noticed
it
if
kate
had
merely
thought
of
smiling
why
do
you
smile
my
dear
she
asked
in
melting
tone
oh
i
was
feeling
so
at
home
answered
kate
suavely
father
and
the
boys
hold
exactly
those
opinions
and
practise
them
in
precisely
the
same
way
only
if
i
were
to
think
about
it
at
all
i
should
think
that
a
man
within
a
year
of
finishing
a
medical
course
would
begin
exercising
politeness
with
every
woman
he
meets
i
believe
a
doctor
depends
on
women
to
be
most
of
his
patients
and
women
do
like
a
rude
doctor
rot
said
george
holt
miss
bates
is
exactly
right
said
his
mother
ai
i
been
you
the
whole
endurin
time
that
you
never
get
a
call
unless
you
practised
manners
as
well
as
medicine
ai
i
now
yes
you
have
he
said
angrily
but
if
you
think
all
of
a
sudden
that
manners
are
so
essential
why
did
you
hammer
some
into
me
when
you
had
the
whip
hand
and
could
do
what
you
pleased
you
did
find
any
fault
with
my
manners
then
how
of
all
the
world
was
i
to
know
that
you
grow
up
and
go
in
for
doctorin
i
then
you
take
the
farm
an
run
it
like
your
pa
did
stead
of
forcin
me
to
sell
it
off
by
inches
to
live
an
then
you
wastin
half
the
money
go
it
mother
said
george
holt
rudely
tell
all
you
know
and
then
piece
out
with
anything
you
can
think
of
that
you
do
holt
face
flushed
crimson
she
looked
at
kate
and
said
vindictively
if
you
want
any
comfort
in
life
never
marry
and
bring
a
son
inter
the
world
you
kin
humour
him
and
cook
for
him
an
work
your
hands
to
the
bone
fur
him
and
sell
your
land
and
spend
all
you
can
raise
educatin
him
for
half
a
dozen
things
an
him
never
stickin
to
none
or
payin
back
a
cent
but
sass
in
your
old
age
go
it
mother
you
doing
fine
said
george
if
you
keep
on
miss
bates
will
want
to
change
her
boarding
place
before
morning
it
will
not
be
wholly
your
mother
fault
if
i
do
said
kate
i
would
suggest
that
if
we
ca
speak
civilly
we
eat
our
supper
in
silence
this
is
very
good
food
i
could
enjoy
it
if
i
had
a
chance
she
helped
herself
to
another
soda
biscuit
and
a
second
piece
of
fried
chicken
and
calmly
began
eating
them
that
a
good
idy
said
holt
then
why
do
you
practice
it
said
her
son
thereupon
began
a
childish
battle
for
the
last
word
kate
calmly
arose
picked
up
her
plate
walked
from
the
room
down
the
hall
and
entering
her
own
room
closed
the
door
quietly
you
fool
you
great
big
dunderheaded
fool
cried
holt
now

have
done
it
for
the
thousandth
time

less
than
no
time

too

house

fifteen
minutes

holt
well

he
boasted
george
holt
pushed
back
his
plate
wiped
his
mouth
brushed
his
teeth
at
the
washing
place
on
the
back
porch
and
sauntered
around
the
house
to
seat
himself
on
the
front
porch
steps
kate
saw
him
there
and
remained
in
her
room
when
he
had
waited
an
hour
he
arose
and
tapped
on
her
door
kate
opened
it
miss
bates
he
said
i
have
been
doing
penance
an
hour
i
am
very
sorry
i
was
such
a
boor
i
was
in
earnest
when
i
said
i
did
get
the
gad
when
i
needed
it
i
had
a
big
disappointment
and
i
came
in
sore
and
cross
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
but
you
will
never
see
me
that
way
again
i
know
i
will
make
a
failure
of
my
profession
if
i
do
be
more
polite
than
mother
ever
taught
me
to
be
wo
you
let
me
be
your
scholar
too
please
do
come
over
to
the
ravine
where
it
is
cool
and
give
me
my
first
lesson
i
need
you
dreadfully
kate
was
desperately
in
need
of
human
companionship
in
that
instant
herself
someone
who
could
speak
and
sin
and
suffer
and
repent
as
she
looked
straight
in
the
face
of
the
man
before
her
she
saw
not
him
being
rude
and
quarrelling
pettily
with
his
mother
but
herself
racing
around
the
dining
table
pursued
by
her
father
raving
like
an
insane
man
who
was
she
to
judge
or
to
refuse
help
when
it
was
asked
she
went
with
him
and
holt
listening
and
peering
from
the
side
of
the
window
blind
of
her
room
across
the
hall
watched
them
cross
the
road
and
sit
beside
each
other
on
the
bank
of
the
ravine
in
what
seemed
polite
and
amicable
conversation
so
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
went
to
wash
the
dishes
and
plan
breakfast
better
feed
her
up
pretty
well
she
gits
the
habit
of
staying
here
and
mebby
the
rest
who
take
boarders
will
be
full
she
said
to
herself
time
enough
to
go
at
skimpin
when
she
settled
and
busy
an
i
get
the
whip
hand
but
in
planning
to
get
the
whip
hand
holt
reckoned
without
kate
she
had
been
under
the
whip
hand
all
her
life
her
dash
to
freedom
had
not
been
accomplished
without
both
mental
and
physical
hurt
she
was
doing
nothing
but
going
over
her
past
life
minutely
and
as
she
realized
more
fully
with
each
review
how
barren
and
unlovely
it
had
been
all
the
strength
and
fresh
young
pride
in
her
arose
in
imperative
demand
for
something
better
in
the
future
she
listened
with
interest
to
what
george
holt
said
to
her
all
her
life
she
had
been
driven
by
a
man
of
inflexible
will
his
very
soul
inoculated
with
greed
for
possessions
which
would
give
him
power
his
body
endowed
with
unfailing
strength
to
meet
the
demands
he
made
on
it
and
his
heart
wholly
lacking
in
sentiment
but
she
did
not
propose
to
start
her
new
life
by
speaking
of
her
family
to
strangers
george
holt
experiences
had
been
those
of
a
son
spoiled
by
a
weak
woman
one
day
petted
the
next
bribed
the
next
nagged
again
left
to
his
own
devices
for
days
with
strong
inherited
tendencies
to
be
fought
tendencies
to
what
he
did
not
say
looking
at
his
heavy
jaw
and
swarthy
face
kate
supplied
temper
and
not
much
inclination
to
work
he
had
asked
her
to
teach
him
she
would
begin
by
setting
him
an
example
in
the
dignity
of
then
she
would
make
him
work
how
she
would
make
that
big
strong
man
work
as
she
sat
there
on
the
bank
of
the
ravine
with
a
background
of
delicately
leafed
bushes
and
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
on
her
face
and
her
hair
george
holt
studied
her
closely
mentally
and
physically
and
would
have
given
all
he
possessed
if
he
had
not
been
so
hasty
he
saw
that
she
had
a
good
brain
and
courage
to
follow
her
convictions
while
on
closer
study
he
decided
that
she
was
moulded
on
the
finest
physical
lines
of
any
woman
he
ever
had
seen
also
his
study
of
medicine
taught
him
to
recognize
glowing
health
and
to
set
a
right
estimate
on
it
truly
he
was
sorry
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
but
he
did
not
believe
in
being
too
humble
he
said
as
much
in
apology
as
he
felt
forced
and
then
set
himself
the
task
of
calling
out
and
parading
the
level
best
he
could
think
up
concerning
himself
or
life
in
general
he
had
tried
farming
teaching
merchandise
and
law
before
he
had
decided
his
vocation
was
medicine
on
account
of
robert
gray
kate
was
much
interested
in
this
but
when
she
asked
what
college
he
was
attending
he
said
he
was
going
to
a
school
in
chicago
that
was
preparing
to
revolutionize
the
world
of
medicine
then
he
started
on
a
hobby
that
he
had
ridden
for
months
paying
for
the
privilege
so
kate
learned
with
surprise
and
no
small
dismay
that
in
a
few
months
a
man
could
take
a
course
in
medicine
that
would
enable
him
to
cure
any
ill
to
which
the
human
flesh
is
heir
as
he
expressed
it
without
knowing
anything
of
surgery
or
drugs
or
using
either
kate
was
amazed
and
said
so
at
once
she
disconcertingly
inquired
what
he
would
do
with
patients
who
had
sustained
fractured
skulls
developed
cancers
or
been
exposed
to
smallpox
but
the
man
before
her
proposed
to
deal
with
none
of
those
disagreeable
things
or
their
like
he
was
going
to
make
fame
and
fortune
in
the
world
by
treating
mental
and
muscular
troubles
he
was
going
to
be
a
zonoletic
doctor
he
turned
teacher
and
spelled
it
for
her
because
she
never
had
heard
the
word
kate
looked
at
george
holt
long
and
with
intense
interest
while
her
mind
was
busy
with
new
thoughts
on
her
pillow
that
night
she
decided
that
if
she
were
a
man
driven
by
a
desire
to
heal
the
suffering
of
the
world
she
would
be
the
man
who
took
the
long
exhaustive
course
of
training
that
enabled
him
to
deal
with
accidents
contagions
and
germ
developments
he
looked
at
her
with
keen
appreciation
of
her
physical
freshness
and
mental
strength
and
manoeuvred
patiently
toward
the
point
where
he
would
dare
ask
blankly
how
many
there
were
in
her
family
and
on
exactly
how
many
acres
her
father
paid
tax
he
decided
it
would
not
do
for
at
least
a
week
yet
possibly
he
could
raise
the
subject
casually
with
someone
down
town
who
would
know
so
that
he
need
never
ask
her
at
all
whatever
the
answer
might
be
it
was
definitely
settled
in
his
own
mind
that
kate
was
the
best
chance
he
had
ever
had
or
probably
ever
would
have
he
mapped
out
his
campaign
this
week
before
he
must
go
he
would
be
her
pupil
and
her
slave
the
holiday
week
he
would
be
her
lover
in
the
spring
he
would
propose
and
in
the
fall
he
would
marry
her
and
live
on
the
income
from
her
land
ever
afterward
it
was
a
glowing
prospect
so
glowing
that
he
seriously
considered
stopping
school
at
once
so
that
her
could
be
at
the
courting
part
of
his
campaign
three
times
a
day
and
every
evening
he
was
afraid
to
leave
for
fear
people
of
the
village
would
tell
the
truth
about
him
he
again
studied
kate
carefully
and
decided
that
during
the
week
that
was
coming
by
deft
and
energetic
work
he
could
so
win
her
approval
that
he
could
make
her
think
that
she
knew
him
better
than
outsiders
did
so
the
siege
began
kate
had
decided
to
try
making
him
work
to
see
if
he
would
or
was
accustomed
to
it
he
was
sufficiently
accustomed
to
it
that
he
could
do
whatever
she
suggested
with
facility
that
indicated
practice
and
there
was
no
question
of
his
willingness
he
urged
her
to
make
suggestions
as
to
what
else
he
could
do
after
he
had
made
all
the
needed
repairs
about
the
house
and
premises
kate
was
enjoying
herself
immensely
before
the
week
was
over
she
had
another
row
of
wood
corded
to
the
shed
roof
in
case
the
winter
should
be
severe
she
had
the
stove
she
thought
would
warm
her
room
polished
and
set
up
while
he
was
there
to
do
it
she
had
the
back
porch
mended
and
the
loose
board
in
the
front
walk
replaced
she
borrowed
buckets
and
cloths
and
impressed
george
holt
for
the
cleaning
of
the
school
building
which
she
superintended
before
the
week
was
over
she
had
every
child
of
school
age
who
came
to
the
building
to
see
what
was
going
on
scouring
out
desks
blacking
stoves
raking
the
yard
even
cleaning
the
street
before
the
building
across
the
street
from
his
home
george
sawed
the
dead
wood
from
the
trees
and
then
with
three
days
to
spare
kate
turned
her
attention
to
the
ravine
she
thought
that
probably
she
could
teach
better
there
in
the
spring
than
in
the
school
building
she
and
george
talked
it
over
he
raised
all
the
objections
he
could
think
of
that
the
townspeople
would
while
entirely
agreeing
with
her
himself
but
it
was
of
no
use
she
the
proxy
objections
he
so
kindly
offered
her
so
he
was
obliged
to
drag
his
tired
body
up
the
trees
on
both
banks
for
several
hundred
yards
and
drop
the
dead
wood
kate
marshalled
a
corps
of
boys
who
would
be
her
older
pupils
and
they
dragged
out
the
dry
branches
saved
all
that
were
suitable
for
firewood
and
made
bonfires
from
the
remainder
they
raked
the
tin
cans
and
town
refuse
of
years
from
the
water
and
banks
and
induced
the
village
delivery
man
to
haul
the
stuff
to
the
river
bridge
and
dump
it
in
the
deepest
place
in
the
stream
they
cleaned
the
creek
bank
to
the
water
edge
and
built
rustic
seats
down
the
sides
they
even
rolled
boulders
to
the
bed
and
set
them
where
the
water
would
show
their
markings
and
beat
itself
to
foam
against
them
holt
looked
on
in
breathless
amazement
and
privately
expressed
to
her
son
her
opinion
of
him
in
terse
and
vigorous
language
he
answered
laconically
has
a
fish
got
much
to
say
about
what
happens
to
it
after
you
get
it
out
of
the
water
no
snapped
holt
and
neither
have
you
if
you
kill
yourself
to
get
it
do
i
look
killed
inquired
her
son
no
you
look
the
most
like
a
real
man
i
ever
saw
you
she
conceded
and
kate
bates
wo
need
glasses
for
forty
years
yet
he
said
as
he
went
back
to
his
work
in
the
ravine
kate
was
in
the
middle
of
the
creek
helping
plant
a
big
stone
he
stood
a
second
watching
her
as
she
told
the
boys
surrounding
her
how
best
to
help
her
then
he
turned
away
a
dull
red
burning
his
cheek
i
have
her
if
i
die
for
it
he
muttered
but
i
hope
to
heaven
she
does
think
i
am
going
to
work
like
this
for
her
every
day
of
my
life
as
the
villagers
sauntered
past
and
watched
the
work
of
the
new
teacher
many
of
them
thought
of
things
at
home
they
could
do
that
would
improve
their
premises
greatly
and
a
few
went
home
and
began
work
of
like
nature
that
made
their
neighbours
places
look
so
unkempt
that
they
were
forced
to
trim
and
rake
and
mend
in
turn
so
by
the
time
the
school
began
the
whole
village
was
busy
in
a
crusade
that
extended
to
streets
and
alleys
while
the
new
teacher
was
the
most
popular
person
who
had
ever
been
there
without
having
heard
of
such
a
thing
kate
had
started
civic
improvement
george
holt
leaned
against
a
tree
trunk
and
looked
down
at
her
as
he
rested
do
you
suppose
there
is
such
a
thing
as
ever
making
anything
out
of
this
he
asked
a
perfectly
lovely
public
park
for
the
village
yes
money
selling
it
for
anything
no
it
too
narrow
a
strip
cut
too
deeply
with
the
water
the
banks
too
steep
commercially
i
ca
see
that
it
is
worth
ten
cents
cheering
it
is
the
only
thing
on
earth
that
truly
and
wholly
belongs
to
me
the
road
divided
the
land
father
willed
everything
on
the
south
side
to
mother
so
she
would
have
the
house
and
the
land
on
this
side
was
mine
i
sold
off
all
i
could
to
jasper
linn
to
add
to
his
farm
but
he
would
only
buy
to
within
about
twenty
rods
of
the
ravine
the
land
was
too
rocky
and
poor
so
about
half
a
mile
of
this
comprises
my
earthly
possessions
do
you
keep
up
the
taxes
she
asked
no
i
never
paid
them
he
said
carelessly
then
do
be
too
sure
it
is
yours
she
said
someone
may
have
paid
them
and
taken
the
land
you
had
better
look
it
up
what
for
he
demanded
it
is
beautiful
it
is
the
shadiest
coolest
place
in
town
having
it
here
doubles
the
value
of
your
mother
house
across
the
street
in
some
way
some
day
it
might
turn
out
to
be
worth
something
i
ca
see
how
he
said
some
of
the
trees
may
become
valuable
when
lumber
gets
scarcer
as
it
will
when
the
land
grows
older
maybe
a
stone
quarry
could
be
opened
up
if
the
stone
runs
back
as
far
as
you
say
a
lot
of
things
might
make
it
valuable
if
i
were
you
i
would
go
to
hartley
quietly
and
examine
the
records
and
if
there
are
back
taxes
i
pay
them
i
look
it
up
anyway
he
agreed
you
surely
have
made
another
place
of
it
it
will
be
wonderful
by
spring
i
can
think
of
many
uses
for
it
said
kate
here
comes
your
mother
to
see
how
we
are
getting
along
instead
she
came
to
hand
kate
a
letter
she
had
brought
from
the
post
office
while
doing
her
marketing
kate
took
the
letter
saw
at
a
glance
that
it
was
from
nancy
ellen
and
excusing
herself
she
went
to
one
of
the
seats
they
had
made
and
turning
her
face
so
that
it
could
not
be
seen
she
read
dear
kate
you
can
prepare
yourself
for
the
surprise
of
your
life
two
bates
men
have
done
something
for
one
of
their
women
i
hope
you
will
survive
the
shock
it
almost
finished
me
and
mother
is
still
speechless
i
wo
try
to
prepare
you
i
could
not
here
it
is
father
raged
for
three
days
and
we
got
out
of
his
way
like
scared
rabbits
i
saw
i
had
to
teach
so
i
said
i
would
but
i
had
not
told
robert
because
i
could
bear
to
then
up
came
hiram
and
offered
to
take
the
school
for
me
father
said
no
i
could
get
out
of
it
that
way
hiram
said
i
had
not
seen
him
or
sent
him
any
word
and
i
could
prove
by
mother
i
had
been
away
from
the
house
so
father
believed
him
he
said
he
wanted
the
money
to
add
two
acres
to
his
land
from
the
simms
place
that
would
let
his
stock
down
to
water
on
the
far
side
of
his
land
where
it
would
be
a
great
convenience
and
give
him
a
better
arrangement
of
fields
so
he
could
make
more
money
you
know
father
he
shut
up
like
a
clam
and
only
said
do
what
you
please
if
a
bates
teaches
the
school
it
makes
my
word
good
so
hiram
is
going
to
teach
for
me
he
is
brushing
up
a
little
nights
and
i
am
helping
him
on
theory
and
i
am
wild
with
joy
and
so

plenty
of
time
to
do
all
my
sewing
and
we
shall
be
married
at
or
after
christmas
robert
says
to
tell
you
to
come
to
see
him
if
you
ever
come
to
hartley
he
is
there
in
his
office
now
and
it
is
lonesome
but
i
am
busy
and
the
time
will
soon
pass
i
might
as
well
tell
you
that
father
said
right
after
you
left
that
you
should
never
enter
his
house
again
and
mother
and
i
should
not
speak
your
name
before

i
do
hope
he
gets
over
it
before
the
wedding
write
me
how
you
like
your
school
and
where
you
board
maybe
robert
and
i
can
slip
off
and
drive
over
to
see
you
some
day
but
that
would
make
father
so
mad
if
he
found
out
that
he
would
not
give
me
the
money
he
promised
so
we
had
better
not
but
you
come
to
see
us
as
soon
as
we
get
in
our
home
love
from
both
nancy
ellen
kate
read
the
joyful
letter
slowly
it
contained
all
she
hoped
for
she
had
not
postponed
nancy
ellen
wedding
that
was
all
she
asked
she
had
known
she
would
not
be
forgiven
so
soon
there
was
slight
hope
she
ever
would
her
only
chance
thought
kate
lay
in
marrying
a
farmer
having
about
a
thousand
acres
of
land
if
she
could
do
that
her
father
would
let
her
come
home
again
sometime
she
read
the
letter
slowly
over
then
tearing
it
in
long
strips
she
cross
tore
them
and
sifted
the
handful
of
small
bits
on
the
water
where
they
started
a
dashing
journey
toward
the
river
holt
narrowly
watching
her
turned
with
snaky
gleaming
eyes
to
her
son
and
whispered
miss
smart
alec
has
a
secret
chapter
vii
helping
nancy
ellen
and
robert
to
establish
a
home
the
remainder
of
the
time
before
leaving
george
holt
spent
in
the
very
strongest
mental
and
physical
effort
to
show
kate
how
much
of
a
man
he
was
he
succeeded
in
what
he
hoped
he
might
do
he
so
influenced
her
in
his
favour
that
during
the
coming
year
whenever
any
one
showed
signs
of
criticising
him
kate
stopped
them
by
commendation
based
upon
what
she
supposed
to
be
knowledge
of
him
with
the
schoolhouse
and
grounds
cleaned
as
they
never
had
been
before
the
parents
and
pupils
naturally
expected
new
methods
during
the
week
spent
in
becoming
acquainted
with
the
teacher
the
parents
heartily
endorsed
her
while
the
pupils
liked
her
cordially
it
could
be
seen
at
a
glance
that
she
could
pick
up
the
brawniest
of
them
and
drop
him
from
the
window
if
she
chose
the
days
at
the
stream
had
taught
them
her
physical
strength
while
at
the
same
time
they
had
glimpses
of
her
mental
processes
the
boys
learned
many
things
that
they
must
not
lie
or
take
anything
which
did
not
belong
to
them
that
they
must
be
considerate
and
manly
if
they
were
to
be
her
friends
yet
not
one
word
had
been
said
on
any
of
these
subjects
as
she
spoke
to
them
they
answered
her
and
soon
spoke
in
the
same
way
to
each
other
she
was
very
careful
about
each
statement
she
made
often
adducing
convenient
proof
so
they
saw
that
she
was
always
right
and
never
exaggerated
the
first
hour
of
this
made
the
boys
think
the
second
they
imitated
the
third
they
instantly
obeyed
she
started
in
to
interest
and
educate
these
children
she
sent
them
home
to
investigate
more
subjects
the
first
day
than
they
had
ever
carried
home
in
any
previous
month
boys
suddenly
began
asking
their
fathers
about
business
girls
questioned
their
mothers
about
marketing
and
housekeeping
the
week
of
christmas
vacation
was
going
to
be
the
hardest
everyone
expected
the
teacher
to
go
home
for
the
holidays
many
of
them
knew
that
her
sister
was
marrying
the
new
doctor
of
hartley
when
kate
was
wondering
how
she
could
possibly
conceal
the
rupture
with
her
family
robert
gray
drove
into
walden
and
found
her
at
the
schoolhouse
she
was
so
delighted
to
see
him
that
she
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
her
joy
he
had
driven
her
way
for
exercise
and
to
pay
her
a
call
when
he
realized
from
her
greeting
how
she
had
felt
the
separation
from
her
family
he
had
an
idea
that
he
at
once
propounded
kate
i
have
come
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
he
said
granted
laughed
kate
whatever
can
it
be
just
this
i
want
you
to
pack
a
few
clothes
drive
to
hartley
with
me
and
do
what
you
can
to
straighten
out
the
house
so
there
wo
be
such
confusion
when
nancy
ellen
gets
there
kate
stared
at
him
in
a
happy
daze
oh
you
blessed
robert
gray
what
a
heavenly
idea
she
cried
of
course
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
fix
nancy
ellen
house
the
way
she
would
but
i
could
put
everything
where
it
belonged
i
could
arrange
well
enough
and
i
could
have
a
supper
ready
so
that
you
could
come
straight
home
then
you
will
do
it
he
asked
do
it
cried
kate
do
it
why
i
would
be
willing
to
pay
you
for
the
chance
to
do
it
how
do
you
think
i
to
explain
my
not
going
home
for
the
holidays
and
to
my
sister
wedding
and
retain
my
before
my
patrons
i
did
think
of
it
in
that
way
he
said
i
crazy
said
kate
take
me
quickly
how
far
along
are
you
house
cleaned
blinds
up
stoves
all
in
coal
and
wood
cellar
stocked
carpets
down
and
furniture
all
there
but
not
unwrapped
or
in
place
dishes
delivered
but
not
washed
cooking
utensils
there
but
not
cleaned
enough
said
laughed
kate
you
go
marry
nancy
ellen
i
shall
have
the
house
warm
arranged
so
you
can
live
in
it
and
the
first
meal
ready
when
you
come
does
nancy
ellen
know
you
are
here
no
i
have
enough
country
practice
that
i
need
a
horse
i
trying
this
one
i
think
of
you
often
so
i
thought
i
drive
out
how
are
you
making
it
kate
just
fine
so
far
as
the
school
goes
i
do
particularly
like
the
woman
i
board
with
her
son
is
some
better
yes
he
is
much
better
and
robert
what
is
a
zonoletic
doctor
a
poor
fool
too
lazy
to
be
a
real
doctor
with
no
conscience
about
taking
people
money
for
nothing
he
said
as
bad
as
that
asked
kate
worse
why
he
said
oh
i
only
wondered
said
kate
now
i
am
ready
here
but
i
must
run
to
the
house
where
i
board
a
minute
it
only
a
step
you
watch
where
i
go
and
drive
down
she
entered
the
house
quietly
and
going
back
to
the
kitchen
she
said
the
folks
have
come
for
me
holt
i
do
know
exactly
when
i
shall
be
back
but
in
plenty
of
time
to
start
school
if
george
goes
before
i
return
tell
him
christmas
for
me
he
be
most
disappointed
to
death
said
holt
i
do
see
why
he
should
said
kate
calmly
you
never
have
had
the
teacher
here
at
christmas
we
never
had
a
teacher
that
i
wanted
before
said
holt
while
kate
turned
to
avoid
seeing
the
woman
face
as
she
perjured
herself
you
like
one
of
the
family
george
is
crazy
about
you
he
wrote
me
to
be
sure
to
keep
you
could
you
possibly
stay
over
sunday
no
i
could
said
kate
who
came
after
you
asked
holt
gray
answered
kate
that
new
doctor
at
hartley
why
be
you
an
him
friends
holt
had
followed
down
the
hall
eagerly
waiting
in
the
doorway
kate
glanced
at
her
and
felt
sudden
pity
the
woman
was
warped
everything
in
her
life
had
gone
wrong
possibly
she
could
not
avoid
being
the
disagreeable
person
she
was
kate
smiled
at
her
worse
than
that
she
said
we
be
relations
in
a
few
days
going
to
marry
my
sister
nancy
ellen
next
tuesday
kate
understood
the
indistinct
gurgle
she
heard
to
be
approving
so
she
added
he
came
after
me
early
so
i
could
go
to
hartley
and
help
get
their
new
house
ready
for
them
to
live
in
after
the
ceremony
did
your
father
give
them
the
house
asked
holt
eagerly
no
gray
bought
his
home
said
kate
how
nice
what
did
your
father
give
them
kate
patience
was
exhausted
you
have
to
wait
until
i
come
back
she
said
i
have
the
gift
of
telling
about
things
before
they
have
happened
then
she
picked
up
her
telescope
and
saying
left
the
house
as
they
drove
toward
hartley
i
anxious
to
see
your
house
said
kate
did
you
find
one
in
a
good
neighbourhood
the
very
best
i
think
said
the
doctor
that
is
all
one
could
offer
nancy
ellen
i
so
glad
for
her
and
i
glad
for
you
too
she
make
you
a
beautiful
wife
in
every
way
she
a
good
cook
she
knows
how
to
economize
and
she
too
pretty
for
words
if
she
is
my
sister
i
heartily
agree
with
you
said
the
doctor
but
i
notice
you
put
the
cook
first
and
the
beauty
last
you
will
too
before
you
get
through
with
it
answered
kate
here
we
are
said
he
soon
after
they
entered
hartley
i
drive
around
the
block
so
you
can
form
an
idea
of
the
location
kate
admired
every
house
in
the
block
the
streets
and
trees
the
one
house
robert
gray
had
selected
in
every
particular
they
went
inside
and
built
fires
had
lunch
together
at
the
hotel
and
then
kate
rolled
up
her
sleeves
and
with
a
few
yards
of
for
a
duster
began
unwrapping
furniture
and
standing
it
in
the
room
where
it
belonged
robert
moved
the
heavy
pieces
then
he
left
to
call
on
a
patient
and
spend
the
evening
with
nancy
ellen
so
kate
spent
several
happy
days
setting
nancy
ellen
new
home
in
order
from
basement
to
garret
she
had
it
immaculate
and
shining
no
bates
girl
not
even
agatha
ever
had
gone
into
a
home
having
so
many
comforts
and
conveniences
kate
felt
lonely
the
day
she
knew
her
home
was
overcrowded
with
all
their
big
family
she
sat
very
still
thinking
of
them
during
the
hour
of
the
ceremony
she
began
preparing
supper
almost
immediately
because
robert
had
promised
her
that
he
would
not
eat
any
more
of
the
wedding
feast
than
he
could
help
and
he
would
bring
nancy
ellen
as
soon
afterward
as
possible
kate
saw
them
drive
to
the
gate
and
come
up
the
walk
together
as
they
entered
the
door
nancy
ellen
was
saying
why
how
does
the
house
come
to
be
all
lighted
up
seems
to
me
i
smell
things
to
eat
well
if
the
table
is
all
set
there
was
a
pause
and
then
nancy
ellen
clear
voice
called
kate
kate
where
are
you
nobody
else
would
be
this
nice
to
me
you
dear
girl
where
are
you
i
get
to
stay
until
i
go
back
to
school
was
kate
mental
comment
as
she
ran
to
clasp
nancy
ellen
in
her
arms
while
they
laughed
and
very
nearly
cried
together
so
that
the
doctor
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
hug
both
of
them
shortly
afterward
he
said
there
is
a
fine
show
in
town
and
i
have
three
tickets
let
all
go
let
eat
before
we
go
said
nancy
ellen
i
have
had
time
to
eat
a
square
meal
for
a
week
and
things
smell
deliciously
they
finished
their
supper
leisurely
stacked
the
dishes
and
went
to
the
theatre
where
they
saw
a
fair
performance
of
a
good
play
which
was
to
both
of
the
girls
a
great
treat
when
they
returned
home
kate
left
nancy
ellen
and
robert
to
gloat
over
the
carpets
they
had
selected
as
they
appeared
on
their
floors
to
arrange
the
furniture
and
their
wedding
gifts
while
she
slipped
into
the
kitchen
and
began
washing
the
dishes
and
planning
what
she
would
have
for
breakfast
but
soon
they
came
to
her
and
nancy
ellen
insisted
on
wiping
the
dishes
while
robert
carried
them
to
the
cupboard
afterward
they
sat
before
their
fireplace
and
talked
over
events
since
the
sisters
separation
nancy
ellen
told
about
getting
ready
for
her
wedding
life
at
home
the
school
the
news
of
the
family
the
kate
drew
a
perfect
picture
of
the
walden
school
her
boarding
place
holt
the
ravine
the
town
and
the
people
with
the
exception
of
george
holt
him
she
never
mentioned
after
robert
had
gone
to
his
office
the
following
morning
kate
said
to
nancy
ellen
now
i
wish
you
would
be
perfectly
frank
with
me
as
if
i
could
be
anything
else
laughed
the
bride
all
right
then
said
kate
what
i
want
is
this
that
these
days
shall
always
come
back
to
you
in
memory
as
nearly
perfect
as
possible
now
if
my
being
here
helps
ever
so
little
i
like
to
stay
and
i
be
glad
to
cook
and
wash
dishes
while
you
fix
your
house
to
suit
you
but
if
you
rather
be
alone
i
go
back
to
walden
and
be
satisfied
and
happy
with
the
fine
treat
this
has
been
i
can
look
everyone
in
the
face
now
talk
about
the
wedding
and
feel
all
right
nancy
ellen
said
slowly
i
sha
spare
you
until
barely
time
to
reach
your
school
monday
morning
and
i
not
keeping
you
to
work
for
me
either
we
do
everything
together
and
then
we
plan
how
to
make
the
house
pretty
and
go
see
robert
in
his
office
and
go
shopping
i
never
forgive
you
if
you
go
why
nancy
ellen
said
kate
then
fled
to
the
kitchen
too
happy
to
speak
further
none
of
them
ever
forgot
that
week
it
was
such
a
happy
time
that
all
of
them
dreaded
its
end
but
when
it
came
they
parted
cheerfully
and
each
went
back
to
work
the
better
for
the
happy
reunion
kate
did
not
return
to
walden
until
monday
then
she
found
holt
in
an
evil
temper
kate
could
not
understand
it
she
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
for
a
week
george
had
nagged
his
mother
unceasingly
because
kate
was
gone
on
his
return
and
would
not
be
back
until
after
time
for
him
to
go
again
the
only
way
for
him
to
see
her
during
the
week
he
had
planned
to
come
out
openly
as
her
lover
was
to
try
to
find
her
at
her
home
or
at
her
sister
he
did
not
feel
that
it
would
help
him
to
go
where
he
never
had
been
asked
his
only
recourse
was
to
miss
a
few
days
of
school
and
do
extra
work
to
make
it
up
but
he
detested
nothing
in
life
as
he
detested
work
so
the
world
happy
week
had
been
to
them
one
of
constant
sparring
and
unhappiness
for
which
holt
blamed
kate
her
son
had
returned
expecting
to
court
kate
bates
strenuously
his
disappointment
was
not
lightened
by
his
mother
constant
nagging
monday
forenoon
she
went
to
market
and
came
in
gasping
land
sakes
she
cried
as
she
panted
down
the
hall
i
got
a
good
one
on
that
impident
huzzy
now

your
mouth
shut
and
not

said
everyone

i
hate
her
worse
snakes
if

for
her
money

fix
her
so

george
holt
clenched
his
big
fist
just

it
he
threatened
just

that

to
see
the
day

he
cried

that
every
day

here
said
holt
starting
to
the
kitchen
to
begin
dinner
kate
appeared
in
half
an
hour
fresh
and
rosy
also
prepared
for
one
of
her
little
pupils
had
said
tilly
nepple
sister
say
you
at
your
sister
wedding
at
all
did
you
cry
you
could
go
instantly
kate
comprehended
what
must
be
town
gossip
so
she
gave
the
child
a
happy
solution
of
the
question
bothering
her
and
went
to
her
boarding
house
forewarned
she
greeted
both
holt
and
her
son
cordially
then
sat
down
to
dinner
in
the
best
of
spirits
the
instant
her
chance
came
holt
said
now
tell
us
all
about
the
lovely
wedding
but
i
was
managing
the
wedding
said
kate
cheerfully
i
was
on
the
infare
job
mother
and
nancy
ellen
put
the
wedding
through
you
know
our
house
is
very
large
and
close
relatives
fill
it
to
bursting
i
seen
the
same
kind
of
wedding
about
every
eighteen
months
all
my
life
i
had
a
new
job
this
time
and
one
i
liked
better
she
turned
to
george
of
course
your
mother
told
you
that
gray
came
after
me
he
came
to
ask
me
as
an
especial
favour
to
go
to
his
new
house
in
hartley
and
do
what
i
could
to
arrange
it
and
to
have
a
supper
ready
i
was
glad
i
seen
six
weddings
that
i
can
remember
all
exactly
alike
there
nothing
to
them
but
brushing
those
new
carpets
unwrapping
nice
furniture
and
placing
it
washing
pretty
new
dishes
untying
the
loveliest
gifts
and
arranging
them
that
was
something
new
in
a
bates
wedding
oh
but
i
had
a
splendid
time
george
holt
looked
at
his
mother
in
too
great
disgust
to
conceal
his
feelings
another
scandal
gone
sky
high
he
said
then
he
turned
to
kate
one
of
the
women
who
worked
in
your
mother
kitchen
is
visiting
here
and
she
started
a
great
hullabaloo
because
you
were
not
at
the
wedding
you
probably
have
got
a
leg
left
to
stand
on
i
suspect
the
old
cats
of
walden
have
chewed
them
both
off
and
all
the
while
you
were
happy
and
doing
the
thing
any
girl
would
much
rather
have
done
lord
i
hate
this
eternal
picking
how
did
you
come
back
kate
gray
brought
me
i
should
think
it
would
have
made
talk
your
staying
there
with
him
commented
holt
fortunately
the
people
of
hartley
seem
reasonably
busy
attending
their
own
affairs
said
kate
doctor
gray
had
been
boarding
at
the
hotel
all
fall
so
he
just
went
on
living
there
until
after
the
wedding
george
glared
at
his
mother
but
she
avoided
his
eyes
and
laughing
in
a
silly
manner
she
said
how
much
money
did
your
father
give
the
bride
i
ca
tell
you
in
even
dollars
and
cents
said
kate
nancy
ellen
did
say
kate
saw
the
movement
of
george
foot
under
the
table
and
knew
that
he
was
trying
to
make
his
mother
stop
asking
questions
so
she
began
talking
to
him
about
his
work
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
finished
he
walked
with
her
to
school
visiting
until
the
session
began
he
remained
three
days
and
before
he
left
he
told
kate
he
loved
her
and
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
she
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
said
why
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
how
long
have
you
been
thinking
about
it
since
the
first
instant
i
saw
you
he
declared
with
fervour
hum
matter
of
months
said
kate
well
when
i
have
had
that
much
time
i
will
tell
you
what
i
think
about
it
chapter
viii
the
history
of
a
leghorn
hat
kate
finished
her
school
in
the
spring
then
went
for
a
visit
with
nancy
ellen
and
robert
before
george
holt
returned
she
was
thankful
to
leave
walden
without
having
seen
him
for
she
had
decided
without
giving
the
matter
much
thought
that
he
was
not
the
man
she
wanted
to
marry
in
her
heart
she
regretted
having
previously
contracted
for
the
walden
school
another
winter
because
she
felt
certain
that
with
the
influence
of
gray
she
could
now
secure
a
position
in
hartley
that
would
enable
her
either
to
live
with
or
to
be
near
her
sister
with
this
thought
in
mind
she
tried
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
teachers
in
the
school
who
lived
in
hartley
and
she
soon
became
rather
intimate
with
one
of
them
it
was
while
visiting
with
this
teacher
that
kate
spoke
of
attending
normal
again
in
an
effort
to
prepare
herself
still
better
for
the
work
of
the
coming
year
her
new
friend
advised
against
it
she
said
the
course
would
be
only
the
same
thing
over
again
with
so
little
change
or
advancement
that
the
trip
was
not
worth
the
time
and
money
it
would
cost
she
proposed
that
kate
go
to
lake
chautauqua
and
take
the
teachers
course
where
all
spare
time
could
be
put
in
attending
lectures
and
concerts
and
studying
the
recently
devised
methods
of
education
kate
went
from
her
to
nancy
ellen
and
robert
determined
at
heart
to
go
she
was
pleased
when
they
strongly
advised
her
to
and
offered
to
help
her
get
ready
aside
from
having
paid
agatha
and
for
her
board
kate
had
spent
almost
nothing
on
herself
she
figured
the
probable
expenses
of
the
trip
for
a
month
what
it
would
cost
her
to
live
until
school
began
again
if
she
were
forced
to
go
to
walden
and
then
spent
all
her
remaining
funds
on
the
prettiest
clothing
she
had
ever
owned
each
of
the
sisters
knew
how
to
buy
carefully
then
the
added
advantage
of
being
able
to
cut
and
make
their
own
clothes
made
money
go
twice
as
far
as
where
a
dressmaker
had
to
be
employed
when
everything
they
had
planned
was
purchased
neatly
made
and
packed
in
a
trunk
into
which
nancy
ellen
slipped
some
of
her
prettiest
belongings
kate
made
a
trip
to
a
milliner
shop
to
purchase
her
first
real
hat
she
had
decided
on
a
big
leghorn
far
from
cheap
while
she
was
trying
the
effect
of
flowers
and
ribbon
on
it
the
wily
milliner
slipped
up
and
with
the
hat
on
kate
golden
crown
looped
in
front
a
bow
of
wide
black
velvet
ribbon
and
drooped
over
the
brim
a
long
exquisitely
curling
ostrich
plume
kate
had
one
good
view
of
herself
before
she
turned
her
back
on
the
temptation
you
look
lovely
in
that
said
the
milliner
do
you
like
it
i
certainly
do
said
kate
i
look
the
best
in
that
hat
with
the
black
velvet
and
the
plume
i
ever
did
but
there
no
use
to
look
twice
i
ca
afford
it
oh
but
it
is
very
reasonable
we
have
a
finer
hat
in
the
store
nor
a
better
plume
said
the
milliner
she
slowly
waved
it
in
all
its
glory
before
kate
eyes
kate
turned
so
she
could
not
see
it
please
excuse
one
question
are
you
teaching
in
walden
this
winter
asked
the
milliner
yes
said
kate
i
have
signed
the
contract
for
that
school
then
charge
the
hat
and
pay
for
it
in
september
i
rather
wait
for
my
money
than
see
you
fail
to
spend
the
summer
under
that
plume
it
really
is
lovely
against
your
gold
hair
thee
behind
me
satan
quoted
kate
no
i
never
had
anything
charged
and
never
expect
to
please
have
the
black
velvet
put
on
and
let
me
try
it
with
the
bows
set
and
sewed
all
right
said
the
milliner
but
i
sorry
she
was
so
sorry
that
she
carried
the
plume
to
the
work
room
and
when
she
walked
up
behind
kate
who
sat
waiting
before
the
mirror
and
carefully
set
the
hat
on
her
head
at
exactly
the
right
angle
the
long
plume
crept
down
one
side
and
drooped
across
the
girl
shoulder
i
will
reduce
it
a
dollar
more
she
said
and
send
the
bill
to
you
at
walden
the
last
week
of
september
kate
moved
her
head
from
side
to
side
lifted
and
dropped
her
chin
then
she
turned
to
the
milliner
you
should
be
killed
she
said
the
woman
reached
for
a
hat
box
no
i
should
she
said
waiting
that
long
i
not
make
much
on
the
hat
but
i
make
a
good
friend
who
will
come
again
and
bring
her
friends
what
is
your
name
please
kate
took
one
look
at
herself
smooth
pink
cheeks
gray
eyes
gold
hair
the
sweeping
wide
brim
the
trailing
plume
miss
katherine
eleanor
bates
she
said
bates
corners
hartley
indiana
please
call
my
carriage
the
milliner
laughed
heartily
that
the
spirit
of
she
commended
i
be
willing
to
wager
something
worth
while
that
this
very
hat
brings
you
the
carriage
before
fall
if
you
show
yourself
in
it
in
the
right
place
it
a
perfectly
stunning
hat
shall
i
send
it
or
will
you
wear
it
kate
looked
in
the
mirror
again
you
may
put
a
fresh
blue
band
on
the
sailor
i
was
wearing
and
send
that
to
gray
when
it
is
finished
she
said
and
put
in
a
fancy
bow
for
my
throat
of
the
same
velvet
as
the
hat
please
i
surely
pay
you
the
last
week
of
september
and
if
you
can
think
up
an
equally
becoming
hat
for
winter
you
just
bet
i
can
young
lady
said
the
milliner
to
herself
as
kate
walked
down
the
street
from
afar
kate
saw
nancy
ellen
on
the
veranda
so
she
walked
slowly
to
let
the
effect
sink
in
but
it
seemed
to
make
no
impression
until
she
looked
up
at
nancy
ellen
very
feet
and
said
well
how
do
you
like
it
good
gracious
cried
nancy
ellen
i
thought
i
was
having
a
stylish
caller
i
did
know
you
why
i
never
saw
you
walk
that
way
before
you
would
expect
me
to
plod
along
as
if
i
were
plowing
with
a
thing
like
this
on
my
head
would
you
i
would
expect
you
to
have
a
thing
like
that
on
your
head
but
since
you
have
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
you
are
stunning
in
it
said
nancy
ellen
better
and
better
laughed
kate
sitting
down
on
the
step
the
milliner
said
it
was
a
stunning
hat
the
goose
said
nancy
ellen
you
become
that
hat
kate
quite
as
much
as
the
hat
becomes
you
the
following
day
dressed
in
a
linen
suit
of
natural
colour
with
the
black
bow
at
her
throat
the
new
hat
in
a
bandbox
and
the
renewed
sailor
on
her
head
kate
waved
her
farewells
to
nancy
ellen
and
robert
on
the
platform
then
walked
straight
to
the
dressing
room
of
the
car
and
changed
the
hats
nancy
ellen
had
told
her
this
was
not
the
thing
to
do
she
should
travel
in
a
plain
untrimmed
hat
and
when
the
dust
and
heat
of
her
journey
were
past
she
should
bathe
put
on
fresh
clothing
and
wear
such
a
fancy
hat
only
with
her
best
frocks
in
the
afternoon
kate
need
not
have
been
told
that
right
instincts
and
bates
economy
would
have
taught
her
the
same
thing
but
she
had
a
perverse
streak
in
her
nature
she
had
seen
herself
in
the
hat
the
milliner
who
knew
enough
of
the
world
and
human
nature
to
know
how
to
sell
kate
the
hat
when
she
never
intended
to
buy
it
and
knew
she
should
not
in
the
way
she
did
had
said
that
before
fall
it
would
bring
her
a
carriage
which
put
into
bald
terms
meant
a
rich
husband
now
kate
liked
her
school
and
she
gave
it
her
full
attention
she
had
done
and
still
intended
to
keep
on
doing
work
in
the
future
but
her
school
or
anything
pertaining
to
it
was
not
worth
mentioning
beside
nancy
ellen
home
and
the
deep
understanding
and
strong
feeling
that
showed
so
plainly
between
her
and
robert
gray
kate
expected
to
marry
by
the
time
she
was
twenty
or
soon
after
all
bates
girls
had
most
of
them
had
married
very
well
indeed
she
frankly
envied
nancy
ellen
while
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
any
one
would
criticise
her
for
saying
so
only
one
thing
could
happen
to
her
that
would
surpass
what
had
come
to
her
sister
if
only
she
could
have
a
man
like
robert
gray
and
have
him
on
a
piece
of
land
of
their
own
kate
was
a
girl
but
no
man
of
the
bates
tribe
ever
was
more
deeply
bitten
by
the
lust
for
land
she
was
the
true
daughter
of
her
father
in
more
than
one
way
if
that
very
expensive
hat
was
going
to
produce
the
man
why
not
let
it
begin
to
work
from
the
very
start
if
her
man
was
somewhere
only
waiting
to
see
her
and
the
hat
would
help
him
to
speedy
recognition
why
miss
a
change
she
thought
over
the
year
and
while
she
deplored
the
estrangement
from
home
she
knew
that
if
she
had
to
go
back
to
one
year
ago
giving
up
the
present
and
what
it
had
brought
and
promised
to
bring
for
a
reconciliation
with
her
father
she
would
not
voluntarily
return
to
the
old
driving
nagging
overwork
and
skimping
missing
every
real
comfort
of
life
to
buy
land
in
which
she
never
would
have
any
part
you
get
your
knocks
the
wings
of
morning
thought
kate
to
herself
but
after
all
it
is
the
only
thing
to
do
nancy
ellen
says
sally
whistler
is
pleasing
mother
very
well
why
should
i
miss
my
chance
and
ruin
my
temper
to
stay
at
home
and
do
the
work
done
by
a
woman
who
can
do
nothing
else
kate
moved
her
head
slightly
to
feel
if
the
big
beautiful
hat
that
sat
her
braids
so
lightly
was
still
there
go
to
work
you
beauty
thought
kate
do
something
better
for
me
than
george
holt
i
have
him
to
fall
back
on
if
i
ca
do
better
but
i
think
i
can
yes
very
sure
i
can
if
you
do
your
part
you
lovely
plume
i
know
i
can
toward
noon
the
train
ran
into
a
violent
summer
storm
the
sky
grew
black
the
lightning
flashed
the
wind
raved
the
rain
fell
in
gusts
the
storm
was
at
its
height
when
kate
quit
watching
it
and
arose
preoccupied
with
her
first
trip
to
a
dining
car
thinking
about
how
little
food
she
could
order
and
yet
avoid
a
hunger
headache
the
twisting
whirlwind
struck
her
face
as
she
stepped
from
the
day
coach
to
go
to
the
dining
car
she
threw
back
her
head
and
sucked
her
lungs
full
of
the
pure
air
she
was
accustomed
to
being
out
in
storms
she
liked
them
one
second
she
paused
to
watch
the
gale
sweeping
the
fields
the
next
a
twitch
at
her
hair
caused
her
to
throw
up
her
hands
and
clutch
wildly
at
nothing
she
sprang
to
the
step
railing
and
leaned
out
in
time
to
see
her
wonderful
hat
whirl
against
the
corner
of
the
car
hold
there
an
instant
with
the
pressure
of
the
wind
then
slide
down
draw
under
and
drop
across
the
rail
where
passing
wheels
ground
it
to
pulp
kate
stood
very
still
a
second
then
she
reached
up
and
tried
to
pat
the
disordered
strands
of
hair
into
place
she
turned
and
went
back
into
the
day
coach
opened
the
bandbox
and
put
on
the
sailor
she
resumed
her
old
occupation
of
thinking
things
over
all
the
joy
had
vanished
from
the
day
and
the
trip
looking
forward
it
had
seemed
all
right
to
defy
custom
and
nancy
ellen
advice
and
do
as
she
pleased
looking
backward
she
saw
that
she
had
made
a
fool
of
herself
in
the
estimation
of
everyone
in
the
car
by
not
wearing
the
sailor
which
was
suitable
for
her
journey
and
would
have
made
no
such
mark
for
a
whirling
wind
she
found
travelling
even
easier
than
any
one
had
told
her
each
station
was
announced
when
she
alighted
there
were
conveyances
to
take
her
and
her
luggage
to
a
hotel
patronized
almost
exclusively
by
teachers
near
the
schools
and
lecture
halls
large
front
suites
and
rooms
were
out
of
the
question
for
kate
but
luckily
a
tiny
corner
room
at
the
back
of
the
building
was
empty
and
when
kate
specified
how
long
she
would
remain
she
secured
it
at
a
less
figure
than
she
had
expected
to
pay
she
began
by
almost
starving
herself
at
supper
in
order
to
save
enough
money
to
replace
her
hat
with
whatever
she
could
find
that
would
serve
passably
and
be
cheap
enough
that
far
she
proceeded
stoically
but
when
night
settled
and
she
stood
in
her
dressing
jacket
brushing
her
hair
something
gave
way
kate
dropped
on
her
bed
and
cried
into
her
pillow
as
she
never
had
cried
before
about
anything
it
was
not
all
about
the
hat
while
she
was
at
it
she
shed
a
few
tears
about
every
cruel
thing
that
had
happened
to
her
since
she
could
remember
that
she
had
borne
tearlessly
at
the
time
it
was
a
deluge
that
left
her
breathless
and
exhausted
when
she
finally
sat
up
she
found
the
room
so
close
she
gently
opened
her
door
and
peeped
into
the
hall
there
was
a
door
opening
on
an
outside
veranda
running
across
the
end
of
the
building
and
the
length
of
the
front
as
she
looked
from
her
door
and
listened
intently
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
woman
voice
in
choking
stifled
sobs
in
the
room
having
a
door
directly
across
the
narrow
hall
from
hers
my
lord
there
two
of
us
said
kate
she
leaned
closer
listening
again
but
when
she
heard
a
short
groan
mingled
with
the
sobs
she
immediately
tapped
on
the
door
instantly
the
sobs
ceased
and
the
room
became
still
kate
put
her
lips
to
the
crack
and
said
in
her
way
it
only
a
rooming
next
you
if
you
ill
could
i
get
anything
for
you
will
you
please
come
in
asked
a
muffled
voice
kate
turned
the
knob
and
stepping
inside
closed
the
door
after
her
she
could
dimly
see
her
way
to
the
dresser
where
she
found
matches
and
lighted
the
gas
on
the
bed
lay
in
a
tumbled
heap
a
tiny
elderly
she
was
fully
dressed
even
to
her
wrap
bonnet
and
gloves
one
hand
clutched
her
side
the
other
held
a
handkerchief
to
her
lips
kate
stood
an
instant
under
the
light
studying
the
situation
the
dark
eyes
in
the
narrow
face
looked
appealingly
at
her
the
woman
tried
to
speak
but
gasped
for
breath
kate
saw
that
she
had
heart
trouble
the
remedy
where
is
it
she
cried
the
woman
pointed
to
a
purse
on
the
dresser
kate
opened
it
took
out
a
small
bottle
and
read
the
directions
in
a
second
she
was
holding
a
glass
to
the
woman
lips
soon
she
was
better
she
looked
at
kate
eagerly
oh
please
do
leave
me
she
gasped
of
course
not
said
kate
instantly
i
stay
as
long
as
you
want
me
she
bent
over
the
bed
and
gently
drew
the
gloves
from
the
frail
hands
she
untied
and
slipped
off
the
bonnet
she
hunted
keys
in
the
purse
opened
a
travelling
bag
and
found
what
she
required
then
slowly
and
carefully
she
undressed
the
woman
helped
her
into
a
night
robe
and
stooping
she
lifted
her
into
a
chair
until
she
opened
the
bed
after
giving
her
time
to
rest
kate
pulled
down
the
white
wavy
hair
and
brushed
it
for
the
night
as
she
worked
she
said
a
word
of
encouragement
now
and
again
when
she
had
done
all
she
could
see
to
do
she
asked
if
there
was
more
the
woman
suddenly
clung
to
her
hand
and
began
to
sob
wildly
kate
knelt
beside
the
bed
stroked
the
white
hair
patted
the
shoulder
she
could
reach
and
talked
very
much
as
she
would
have
to
a
little
girl
please
do
cry
she
begged
it
must
be
your
heart
you
surely
make
it
worse
i
trying
said
the
woman
but
i
been
scared
sick
i
most
certainly
would
have
died
if
you
had
come
to
me
and
found
the
medicine
oh
that
dreadful
susette
how
could
she
the
clothing
kate
had
removed
from
the
woman
had
been
of
finest
cloth
and
silk
her
hands
wore
wonderful
rings
a
heavy
purse
was
in
her
bag
everything
she
had
was
the
finest
that
money
could
buy
while
she
seemed
as
if
a
rough
wind
never
had
touched
her
she
appeared
so
frail
that
kate
feared
to
let
her
sleep
without
knowing
where
to
locate
her
friends
she
should
be
punished
for
leaving
you
alone
among
strangers
said
kate
indignantly
if
i
only
could
learn
to
mind
john
sighed
the
little
woman
he
never
liked
susette
but
she
was
the
very
best
maid
i
ever
had
she
was
like
a
loving
daughter
until
all
at
once
on
the
train
among
strangers
she
flared
out
at
me
and
simply
raved
oh
it
was
dreadful
and
knowing
you
were
subject
to
these
attacks
she
did
the
thing
that
would
precipitate
one
and
then
left
you
alone
among
strangers
how
wicked
how
cruel
said
kate
in
tense
indignation
john
did
want
me
to
come
but
i
used
to
be
a
teacher
and
i
came
here
when
this
place
was
mostly
woods
with
my
dear
husband
then
after
he
died
through
the
long
years
of
poverty
and
struggle
i
would
read
of
the
place
and
the
wonderful
meetings
but
i
could
never
afford
to
come
then
when
john
began
to
work
and
made
good
so
fast
i
was
dizzy
half
the
time
with
his
successes
i
did
think
about
the
place
but
lately
since
i
had
everything
else
i
could
think
of
something
possessed
me
to
come
back
here
and
take
a
suite
among
the
women
and
men
who
are
teaching
our
young
people
so
wonderfully
and
to
sail
on
the
lake
and
hear
the
lectures
and
dream
my
youth
over
again
i
think
that
was
it
most
of
all
to
dream
my
youth
over
again
to
try
to
relive
the
past
there
now
you
have
told
me
all
about
it
said
kate
stroking
the
white
forehead
in
an
effort
to
produce
drowsiness
close
your
eyes
and
go
to
sleep
i
have
even
begun
to
tell
you
said
the
woman
perversely
if
i
talked
all
night
i
could
tell
you
about
john
how
big
he
is
and
how
brave
he
is
and
how
smart
he
is
and
how
he
is
the
equal
of
any
business
man
in
chicago
and
soon
if
he
keeps
on
he
will
be
worth
as
much
as
some
of
them
more
than
any
one
of
his
age
who
has
had
a
lot
of
help
instead
of
having
his
way
to
make
alone
and
a
sick
old
mother
to
support
besides
no
i
could
tell
you
in
a
week
half
about
john
and
he
did
want
me
to
come
if
i
would
come
then
he
wanted
me
to
wait
a
few
days
until
he
finished
a
deal
so
he
could
bring
me
but
the
minute
i
thought
of
it
i
was
determined
to
come
you
know
how
you
get
i
know
how
badly
you
want
to
do
a
thing
you
have
set
your
heart
on
admitted
kate
i
had
gone
places
with
susette
in
perfect
comfort
i
think
the
trouble
was
that
she
tried
from
the
first
to
attract
john
about
the
time
we
started
he
let
her
see
plainly
that
all
he
wanted
of
her
was
to
take
care
of
me
she
was
pretty
and
smart
so
it
made
her
furious
she
was
pampered
in
everything
as
no
maid
i
ever
had
before
john
is
young
yet
and
i
think
he
is
very
handsome
and
he
would
pay
any
attention
to
her
you
see
when
other
boys
were
going
to
school
and
getting
acquainted
with
girls
by
association
even
when
he
was
a
little
bit
of
a
fellow
in
knee
breeches
i
had
to
let
him
sell
papers
and
then
he
got
into
a
shop
and
he
invented
a
little
thing
and
then
a
bigger
and
bigger
yet
and
then
he
went
into
stocks
and
things
and
he
does
know
anything
about
girls
only
about
sick
old
women
like
me
he
never
saw
what
susette
was
up
to
you
do
believe
that
i
was
ugly
to
her
do
you
you
could
be
ugly
if
you
tried
said
kate
the
woman
suddenly
began
to
sob
again
this
time
slowly
as
if
her
forces
were
almost
spent
she
looked
to
kate
for
the
sympathy
she
craved
and
for
the
first
time
really
saw
her
closely
why
you
dear
girl
she
cried
your
face
is
all
tear
stained
you
been
crying
yourself
roaring
in
a
pillow
admitted
kate
but
my
dear
forgive
me
i
was
so
upset
with
that
dreadful
woman
forgive
me
for
not
having
seen
that
you
too
are
in
trouble
you
please
tell
me
of
course
said
kate
i
lost
my
new
hat
but
my
dear
crying
over
a
hat
when
it
is
so
easy
to
get
another
how
foolish
said
the
woman
yes
but
you
did
see
the
hat
said
kate
and
it
will
be
far
from
easy
to
get
another
with
this
one
not
paid
for
yet
i
only
one
season
removed
from
sunbonnets
so
i
never
should
have
bought
it
at
all
the
woman
moved
in
bed
and
taking
one
of
kate
long
crinkly
braids
she
drew
the
wealth
of
gold
through
her
fingers
repeatedly
tell
me
about
your
hat
she
said
so
to
humour
this
fragile
woman
and
to
keep
from
thinking
of
her
own
trouble
kate
told
the
story
of
her
leghorn
hat
and
ostrich
plume
and
many
things
besides
for
she
was
not
her
usual
terse
self
with
her
new
friend
who
had
to
be
soothed
to
forgetfulness
kate
ended
i
was
all
wrong
to
buy
such
a
hat
in
the
first
place
i
could
afford
it
it
was
foolish
vanity
i
not
really
i
should
have
flattered
myself
that
i
was
losing
it
before
it
was
paid
for
was
just
good
for
me
never
again
will
i
be
so
foolish
why
my
dear
do
say
such
things
or
think
them
chided
the
little
woman
you
had
as
good
a
right
to
a
becoming
hat
as
any
girl
now
let
me
ask
you
one
question
and
then
i
try
to
sleep
you
said
you
were
a
teacher
did
you
come
here
to
attend
the
summer
school
for
teachers
yes
said
kate
would
it
make
any
great
difference
to
you
if
you
missed
a
few
days
she
asked
not
the
least
said
kate
well
then
you
wo
be
offended
will
you
if
i
ask
you
to
remain
with
me
and
take
care
of
me
until
john
comes
i
could
send
him
a
message
that
i
am
alone
and
bring
him
by
this
time
but
i
know
he
has
business
that
will
cause
him
to
lose
money
should
he
leave
and
i
was
so
wilful
about
coming
i
dread
to
prove
him
right
so
conclusively
the
very
first
day
that
door
opens
into
a
room
reserved
for
susette
if
only
you
take
it
and
leave
the
door
unclosed
and
if
only
you
would
stay
with
me
until
john
comes
i
could
well
afford
to
pay
you
enough
to
lengthen
your
stay
as
long
as
like
and
it
makes
me
so
happy
to
be
with
such
a
fresh
young
creature
will
you
stay
with
me
my
dear
i
certainly
will
said
kate
heartily
if
you
only
tell
me
what
i
should
do
i
not
accustomed
to
rich
ladies
you
know
i
not
myself
said
the
little
woman
but
i
do
seem
to
take
to
being
waited
upon
with
the
most
remarkable
facility
chapter
ix
a
sunbonnet
girl
with
the
first
faint
light
of
morning
kate
slipped
to
the
door
to
find
her
charge
still
sleeping
soundly
it
was
eight
when
she
heard
a
movement
in
the
adjoining
room
and
went
again
to
the
door
this
time
the
woman
was
awake
and
smilingly
waved
to
kate
as
she
called
good
morning
come
right
in
i
was
wondering
if
you
were
regretting
your
hasty
bargain
not
a
bit
of
it
laughed
kate
i
am
here
waiting
to
be
told
what
to
do
first
i
forgot
to
tell
you
my
name
last
night
it
is
kate
bates
i
from
bates
corners
hartley
indiana
the
woman
held
out
her
hand
i
so
very
glad
to
meet
you
miss
bates
she
said
my
name
is
mariette
jardine
my
home
is
in
chicago
they
shook
hands
smiling
at
each
other
and
then
kate
said
now
jardine
what
shall
i
do
for
you
first
i
will
be
dressed
i
think
and
then
you
may
bring
up
the
manager
until
i
have
an
understanding
with
him
and
give
him
a
message
i
want
sent
and
an
order
for
our
breakfast
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
nice
to
have
it
served
on
the
corner
of
the
veranda
in
front
of
our
rooms
under
the
shade
of
that
big
tree
i
think
that
would
be
famous
said
kate
they
ate
together
under
the
spreading
branches
of
a
giant
maple
tree
where
they
could
see
into
the
nest
of
an
oriole
that
brooded
in
a
long
purse
of
gray
lint
and
white
cotton
cord
they
could
almost
reach
out
and
touch
it
the
breakfast
was
good
nicely
served
by
a
neat
maid
evidently
doing
something
so
out
of
the
ordinary
that
she
was
rather
stunned
but
she
was
a
young
person
of
some
for
when
she
removed
the
tray
jardine
thanked
her
and
gave
her
a
coin
that
brought
a
smiling
thank
you
very
much
if
you
want
your
dinner
served
here
and
will
ask
for
jennie
weeks
i
like
to
wait
on
you
again
thank
you
said
jardine
i
shall
remember
that
i
do
like
changing
waiters
each
meal
it
gives
them
no
chance
to
learn
what
i
want
or
how
i
want
it
then
she
and
kate
slowly
walked
the
length
of
the
veranda
several
times
while
she
pointed
out
parts
of
the
grounds
they
could
see
that
remained
as
she
had
known
them
formerly
and
what
were
improvements
when
jardine
was
tired
they
returned
to
the
room
and
she
lay
on
the
bed
while
they
talked
of
many
things
talked
of
things
with
which
kate
was
familiar
and
some
concerning
which
she
unhesitatingly
asked
questions
until
she
felt
informed
jardine
was
so
dainty
so
delicate
yet
so
full
of
life
so
well
informed
so
keen
mentally
that
as
she
talked
she
kept
kate
chuckling
most
of
the
time
she
talked
of
her
home
life
her
travels
her
friends
her
son
she
talked
of
politics
religion
and
education
then
she
talked
of
her
son
again
she
talked
of
social
conditions
civic
improvement
and
woman
rights
then
she
came
back
to
her
son
until
kate
saw
that
he
was
the
real
interest
in
the
world
to
her
the
mental
picture
she
drew
of
him
was
peculiar
one
minute
jardine
spoke
of
him
as
a
man
among
men
pushing
fighting
forcing
matters
to
work
to
his
will
so
kate
imagined
him
tall
broad
and
brawny
indefatigable
in
his
undertakings
the
next
his
mother
was
telling
of
such
thoughtfulness
such
kindness
such
loving
care
that
kate
mental
picture
shifted
to
a
neat
exacting
little
man
purely
effeminate
as
men
ever
can
be
but
whatever
she
thought
some
right
instinct
prevented
her
from
making
a
comment
or
asking
a
question
once
she
sat
looking
far
across
the
beautiful
lake
with
such
an
expression
on
her
face
that
jardine
said
to
her
what
are
you
thinking
of
my
dear
kate
said
smilingly
oh
i
was
thinking
of
what
a
wonderful
school
i
shall
teach
this
winter
tell
me
what
you
mean
said
jardine
why
with
even
a
month
of
this
i
shall
have
riches
stored
for
every
day
of
the
year
said
kate
none
of
my
pupils
ever
saw
a
lake
that
i
know
of
i
shall
tell
them
of
this
with
its
shining
water
its
rocky
shady
sandy
shore
lines
of
the
rowboats
and
and
the
people
from
all
over
the
country
before
i
go
back
i
can
tell
them
of
wonderful
lectures
concerts
educational
demonstrations
here
i
shall
get
much
from
the
experiences
of
other
teachers
i
shall
delight
my
pupils
with
just
you
in
what
way
asked
jardine
oh
i
shall
tell
them
of
a
dainty
little
woman
who
know
everything
from
you
i
shall
teach
my
girls
to
be
simple
wholesome
tender
and
kind
to
take
the
gifts
of
god
thankfully
reverently
yet
with
from
you
i
can
tell
them
what
really
fine
fabrics
are
and
about
laces
and
linens
when
the
subjects
arise
as
they
always
do
in
teaching
i
shall
describe
each
ring
you
wear
each
comb
and
pin
even
the
handkerchiefs
you
carry
and
the
bags
you
travel
with
to
teach
means
to
educate
and
it
is
a
big
task
but
it
is
almost
painfully
interesting
each
girl
of
my
school
shall
go
into
life
a
gentler
daintier
woman
more
careful
of
her
person
and
speech
because
of
my
having
met
you
is
that
a
fine
thought
why
you
darling
cried
jardine
life
is
always
having
lovely
things
in
store
for
me
yesterday
i
thought
susette
leaving
me
as
she
did
was
the
most
cruel
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
i
get
from
it
this
lovely
experience
if
you
are
straight
from
sunbonnets
as
you
told
me
last
night
where
did
you
get
these
advanced
ideas
if
sunbonnets
could
speak
many
of
them
would
tell
of
surprising
heads
they
have
covered
laughed
kate
life
deals
with
women
much
the
same
as
with
men
if
we
go
back
to
where
we
start
history
can
prove
to
you
that
there
are
ten
sunbonnets
to
one
leghorn
hat
in
the
high
places
of
the
world
not
to
entertain
me
but
because
i
am
interested
my
dear
will
you
tell
me
about
your
particular
sunbonnet
asked
jardine
kate
sat
staring
across
the
blue
lake
with
wide
eyes
a
queer
smile
twisting
her
lips
at
last
she
said
slowly
well
then
my
sunbonnet
is
in
my
trunk
i
not
so
far
away
from
it
but
that
it
still
travels
with
me
it
blue
chambray
made
from
pieces
left
from
my
first
pretty
dress
it
is
ruffled
and
has
white
stitching
i
made
it
myself
the
head
that
it
fits
is
another
matter
i
did
make
that
or
its
environment
or
what
was
taught
it
until
it
was
of
age
and
had
worked
out
its
legal
time
of
service
to
pay
for
having
been
a
head
at
all
but
my
head
is
now
free
in
my
own
possession
ready
to
go
as
fast
and
far
on
the
path
of
life
as
it
develops
the
brains
to
carry
it
you
smile
if
i
should
tell
you
what
i
ask
of
life
if
i
could
have
what
i
want
i
scarcely
think
so
please
tell
me
you
be
shocked
warned
kate
just
so
it
is
enough
to
set
my
heart
rocking
again
said
jardine
we
stop
before
that
laughed
kate
then
if
you
will
have
it
i
want
of
life
by
the
time
i
am
twenty
a
man
of
my
stature
dark
eyes
and
hair
because
i
am
so
light
i
want
him
to
be
honest
forceful
hard
working
with
a
few
drops
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
in
his
heart
and
the
same
ambitions
i
have
and
what
are
your
ambitions
asked
jardine
to
own
and
to
cultivate
and
to
bring
to
the
highest
state
of
efficiency
at
least
two
hundred
acres
of
land
with
convenient
and
attractive
buildings
and
pedigreed
stock
and
to
mother
at
least
twelve
perfect
physical
and
mental
boys
and
girls
oh
my
soul
cried
jardine
falling
back
in
her
chair
her
mouth
agape
my
dear
you
do
mean
that
you
only
said
that
to
shock
me
but
why
should
i
wish
to
shock
you
i
sincerely
mean
it
persisted
kate
you
amazing
creature
i
never
heard
a
girl
talk
like
that
before
said
jardine
but
you
ca
look
straight
ahead
of
you
any
direction
you
turn
without
seeing
a
girl
working
for
dear
life
to
attract
the
man
she
wants
if
she
ca
secure
him
some
other
man
and
in
lieu
of
him
any
man
at
all
in
preference
to
none
life
shows
us
woman
on
the
quest
every
day
everywhere
we
go
why
be
so
secretive
about
it
why
not
say
honestly
what
we
want
and
take
it
if
we
can
get
it
at
any
rate
that
is
the
most
important
thing
inside
my
sunbonnet
i
knew
you
be
shocked
but
i
am
not
shocked
at
what
you
say
i
agree
with
you
what
i
am
shocked
at
is
your
ideals
i
thought
you
want
to
educate
yourself
to
such
superiority
over
common
woman
that
you
could
take
the
platform
and
backed
by
your
splendid
physique
work
for
suffrage
or
lecture
to
educate
the
masses
i
think
more
could
be
accomplished
with
selected
specimens
by
being
steadily
on
the
job
than
by
giving
an
hour
to
masses
i
not
much
interested
in
masses
they
are
too
abstract
for
me
i
prefer
one
stern
reality
and
as
for
woman
rights
if
anybody
gives
this
woman
the
right
to
do
anything
more
than
she
already
has
the
right
to
do
there
surely
be
a
scandal
jardine
lay
back
in
her
chair
laughing
you
are
the
most
refreshing
person
i
have
met
in
all
my
travels
then
to
put
it
baldly
you
want
of
life
a
man
a
farm
and
a
family
you
comprehend
me
beautifully
said
kate
all
my
life
i
worked
like
a
towhead
to
help
earn
two
hundred
acres
of
land
for
someone
else
i
think
there
nothing
i
want
so
much
as
two
hundred
acres
of
land
for
myself
i
undertake
to
do
almost
anything
with
it
if
i
had
it
i
know
i
could
if
i
had
the
real
man
you
notice
it
will
take
considerable
of
a
man
to
touch
shoulders
with
me
i
a
head
taller
than
most
of
them
jardine
looked
at
her
speculatively
ummm
she
murmured
kate
laughed
for
eighteen
years
i
have
been
under
marching
orders
said
kate
over
a
year
ago
i
was
advised
by
a
minister
to
the
wings
of
morning
so
i
took
wing
i
started
on
one
grand
flight
and
fell
in
short
order
life
since
has
been
a
series
of
battering
my
wings
until
i
have
almost
decided
to
buy
some
especially
heavy
boots
and
walk
the
remainder
of
the
way
as
a
concrete
example
i
started
out
yesterday
morning
wearing
a
hat
that
several
very
reliable
parties
assured
me
would
so
assist
me
to
flight
that
i
might
at
least
have
a
carriage
where
oh
where
are
my
hat
and
my
carriage
now
the
carriage
non
est
the
hat
i
am
humbly
hoping
some
little
country
girl
who
has
lived
a
life
as
barren
as
mine
will
find
the
remains
and
retrieve
the
velvet
bow
for
a
as
for
the
man
that
leghorn
hat
was
supposed
to
symbolize
he
wo
even
look
my
way
when
i
appear
in
my
bobby
little
sailor
he
as
badly
crushed
out
of
existence
as
my
beautiful
hat
you
never
should
have
been
wearing
such
a
hat
to
travel
in
my
dear
murmured
jardine
certainly
not
said
kate
i
knew
it
my
sister
told
me
that
common
sense
told
me
that
but
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
the
fact
that
i
was
wearing
the
hat
i
guess
i
have
you
there
far
from
it
said
jardine
if
you
going
to
start
out
in
life
calmly
ignoring
the
advice
of
those
who
love
you
and
the
dictates
of
common
sense
the
result
will
be
that
soon
the
wheels
of
life
will
be
grinding
you
instead
of
a
train
making
of
your
hat
hummm
said
kate
there
is
food
for
reflection
there
but
it
plain
logic
that
if
the
hat
was
to
bring
the
man
it
should
be
worn
where
at
any
minute
he
might
see
it
but
my
dear
my
dear
if
such
a
man
as
a
woman
like
you
should
have
had
seen
you
wearing
that
hat
in
the
morning
on
a
railway
train
he
would
merely
have
thought
you
prideful
and
extravagant
you
would
have
been
far
more
attractive
to
any
man
i
know
in
your
blue
sunbonnet
i
surely
have
learned
that
lesson
said
kate
hereafter
sailors
or
sunbonnets
for
me
in
the
morning
now
what
may
i
do
to
add
to
your
comfort
leave
me
for
an
hour
until
i
take
a
nap
and
then
we
have
lunch
and
go
to
a
lecture
i
can
go
perfectly
well
after
an
rest
so
kate
went
for
a
very
interesting
walk
around
the
grounds
when
she
returned
jardine
was
still
sleeping
so
she
wrote
nancy
ellen
telling
all
about
her
adventure
but
not
a
word
about
losing
her
hat
then
she
had
a
talk
with
jennie
weeks
whom
she
found
lingering
in
the
hall
near
her
door
when
at
last
that
nap
was
over
a
new
woman
seemed
to
have
developed
jardine
was
so
refreshed
and
interested
the
remainder
of
the
day
that
it
was
easier
than
before
for
kate
to
see
how
shocked
and
ill
she
had
been
as
she
helped
dress
her
for
lunch
kate
said
to
jardine
i
met
the
manager
as
i
was
going
to
post
a
letter
to
my
sister
so
i
asked
him
always
to
send
you
the
same
waiter
he
said
he
would
and
i
like
you
to
pay
particular
attention
to
her
appearance
and
the
way
she
does
her
work
why
asked
jardine
i
met
her
in
the
hall
as
i
came
back
from
posting
my
letter
so
we
a
little
as
the
country
folks
say
she
has
taught
one
winter
of
country
school
a
small
school
in
an
out
county
she
here
waiting
table
two
hours
three
times
a
day
to
pay
for
her
room
and
board
in
the
meantime
she
attends
all
the
sessions
and
studies
as
much
as
she
can
but
she
very
poor
material
for
a
teacher
i
pity
her
pupils
she
a
little
thing
bright
enough
in
her
way
but
she
has
not
much
initiative
not
strong
enough
for
the
work
and
she
has
not
enough
spunk
she
never
lead
the
minds
of
school
children
anywhere
that
will
greatly
benefit
them
and
your
deduction
is
that
she
would
make
you
a
kind
careful
obedient
maid
who
is
capable
enough
to
be
taught
to
wash
your
hair
and
manicure
you
with
deftness
and
who
would
serve
you
for
respect
as
well
as
hire
i
think
it
would
be
a
fine
arrangement
for
you
and
good
for
her
this
surely
is
kind
of
you
said
jardine
i
keep
strict
watch
of
jennie
weeks
if
i
could
find
a
really
capable
maid
here
and
not
have
to
wire
john
to
bring
one
i
be
so
glad
it
does
so
go
against
the
grain
to
prove
to
a
man
that
he
has
a
right
to
be
more
conceited
than
he
is
naturally
as
they
ate
lunch
kate
said
to
jardine
i
noticed
one
thing
this
morning
that
is
going
to
be
balm
to
my
soul
i
passed
many
teachers
and
summer
resorters
going
to
the
lecture
halls
and
coming
from
them
and
half
of
them
were
bareheaded
so
my
state
will
not
be
remarkable
until
i
can
get
another
hat
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
his
wonders
to
perform
laughingly
quoted
jardine
you
thought
losing
that
precious
hat
was
a
calamity
but
if
you
had
lost
it
you
probably
would
have
slept
soundly
while
i
died
across
the
hall
my
life
is
worth
the
price
of
a
whole
millinery
shop
to
me
i
think
you
value
the
friendship
we
are
developing
i
foresee
i
shall
get
a
maid
who
will
not
disgrace
my
in
public
you
will
have
a
full
summer
here
now
truly
is
all
this
worth
many
hats
of
course
it
like
a
fairy
tale
said
kate
still
you
see
the
hat
but
you
described
it
in
a
truly
graphic
manner
said
jardine
when
i
am
the
snowiest
of
i
shall
still
be
telling
small
people
about
the
outcome
of
my
first
attempt
at
vanity
laughed
kate
the
third
morning
dawned
in
great
beauty
a
misty
moisty
morning
jardine
called
it
the
sun
tried
to
shine
but
could
not
quite
pierce
the
intervening
clouds
so
on
every
side
could
be
seen
exquisite
pictures
painted
in
delicate
pastel
colours
kate
fresh
and
rosy
wearing
a
blue
chambray
dress
was
a
picture
well
worth
seeing
jardine
kept
watching
her
so
closely
that
kate
asked
at
last
have
you
made
up
your
mind
yet
no
and
i
am
afraid
i
never
shall
answered
jardine
you
are
rather
an
astonishing
creature
you
so
big
so
vital
you
absorb
knowledge
like
a
sponge
takes
water
and
for
the
same
purpose
laughed
kate
that
it
may
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
others
tell
me
some
more
about
me
i
find
me
such
an
interesting
subject
no
doubt
admitted
jardine
not
a
doubt
about
that
we
are
all
more
interested
in
ourselves
than
in
any
one
else
in
this
world
until
love
comes
then
we
soon
learn
to
a
love
man
more
than
life
and
when
a
child
comes
we
learn
another
love
so
clear
so
high
so
purifying
that
we
become
of
no
moment
at
all
and
live
only
for
those
we
love
you
speak
for
yourself
and
a
class
of
women
like
you
answered
kate
gravely
i
very
well
acquainted
with
many
women
who
have
married
and
borne
children
and
who
are
possibly
more
selfish
than
before
the
great
experience
never
touched
them
at
all
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
kate
opened
it
and
delivered
to
jardine
a
box
so
big
that
it
almost
blocked
the
doorway
jardine
lifted
from
the
box
a
big
leghorn
hat
of
weave
so
white
and
fine
it
almost
seemed
like
woven
cloth
instead
of
braid
there
was
a
bow
in
front
but
the
bow
was
nested
in
and
tied
through
a
web
of
flowered
gold
lace
one
velvet
end
was
slightly
long
and
concealed
a
wire
which
lifted
one
side
of
the
brim
a
trifle
beneath
which
was
fastened
a
smashing
big
velvet
rose
there
was
an
ostrich
plume
even
longer
than
the
other
broader
blacker
as
wonderful
a
feather
as
ever
dropped
from
the
plumage
of
a
lordly
bird
jardine
shook
the
hat
in
such
a
way
as
to
set
the
feather
lifting
and
waving
after
the
confinement
of
the
box
with
slender
sure
fingers
she
set
the
bow
and
lace
as
they
should
be
and
touched
the
petals
of
the
rose
she
inspected
the
hat
closely
shook
it
again
and
held
it
toward
kate
a
very
small
price
to
pay
for
the
breath
of
life
which
i
was
rapidly
losing
she
said
do
me
the
favour
to
accept
it
as
casually
as
i
offer
it
did
i
understand
your
description
anywhere
near
right
is
this
your
hat
thank
you
said
kate
it
is
just
speaking
image
of
my
hat
but
it
a
glorified
sublimated
celestial
image
what
i
described
was
merely
a
hat
this
is
what
i
think
i
have
lately
heard
nancy
ellen
mention
as
a
wheuuuuuu
she
went
to
the
mirror
arranged
her
hair
set
the
hat
on
her
head
and
turned
gracious
heaven
said
jardine
my
dear
i
understand
now
why
you
wore
that
hat
on
your
journey
i
wore
that
hat
said
kate
as
an
ascension
stalk
wears
its
crown
of
white
lilies
as
a
bobolink
wears
its
snowy
courting
crest
as
a
bride
wears
her
veil
but
please
take
this
from
me
lest
i
sleep
in
it
that
night
jardine
felt
tired
enough
to
propose
resting
in
her
room
with
jennie
weeks
where
she
could
be
called
so
for
the
first
time
kate
left
her
and
donning
her
best
white
dress
and
the
hat
attended
a
concert
at
its
close
she
walked
back
to
the
hotel
with
some
of
the
other
teachers
stopping
there
talked
a
few
minutes
in
the
hall
went
to
the
office
desk
for
mail
and
slowly
ascended
the
stairs
thinking
intently
what
she
thought
was
if
i
am
not
mistaken
my
hat
did
a
small
bit
of
execution
she
stepped
to
her
room
to
lock
the
door
and
stopped
a
few
minutes
to
arrange
the
clothing
she
had
discarded
when
she
dressed
hurriedly
before
going
to
the
concert
then
the
letters
in
her
hand
she
opened
jardine
door
a
few
minutes
before
there
had
been
a
tap
on
that
same
door
come
in
said
jardine
expecting
kate
or
jennie
weeks
she
slowly
lifted
her
eyes
and
faced
a
tall
slender
man
standing
there
john
jardine
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
she
demanded
after
the
manner
of
mothers
and
what
in
this
world
has
happened
to
you
does
it
show
on
me
like
that
he
stammered
was
your
train
in
a
wreck
are
you
in
trouble
she
asked
something
shows
plainly
enough
but
i
do
understand
what
it
is
are
you
all
right
mother
he
advanced
a
step
looking
intently
at
her
of
course
i
all
right
you
can
see
that
for
yourself
the
question
is
what
the
matter
with
you
if
you
will
have
it
there
is
something
the
matter
since
i
saw
you
last
i
have
seen
a
woman
i
want
to
marry
that
all
unless
i
add
that
i
want
her
so
badly
that
i
have
much
sense
left
now
you
have
it
no
i
do
have
it
and
i
wo
have
it
what
designing
creature
has
been
trying
to
intrigue
you
now
she
demanded
not
any
one
she
did
see
me
even
i
saw
her
i
been
following
her
for
nearly
two
hours
instead
of
coming
straight
to
you
as
i
always
have
so
you
see
where
i
am
i
expect
you
wo
forgive
me
but
since
i
here
you
must
know
that
i
could
only
come
on
the
evening
train
he
crossed
the
room
knelt
beside
the
chair
and
took
it
and
its
contents
in
his
arms
are
you
going
to
scold
me
he
asked
i
am
she
said
i
am
going
to
take
you
out
and
push
you
into
the
deepest
part
of
the
lake
i
so
disappointed
why
john
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
selected
a
girl
for
you
the
very
most
suitable
girl
i
ever
saw
and
i
hoped
and
hoped
for
three
days
that
when
you
came
you
like
her
of
course
i
was
so
rash
as
to
say
a
word
to
her
but
i
thought
myself
into
a
state
where
i
going
to
be
sick
with
disappointment
but
wait
mother
wait
until
i
can
manage
to
meet
the
girl
i
seen
wait
until
i
have
a
chance
to
show
her
to
you
he
begged
i
suppose
i
shall
be
forced
she
said
i
always
dreaded
it
now
here
it
comes
oh
why
could
it
have
been
kate
why
did
she
go
to
that
silly
concert
if
only
i
kept
her
here
and
we
walked
down
to
the
station
i
half
a
mind
to
then
the
door
opened
and
kate
stepped
into
the
room
she
stood
still
looking
at
them
john
jardine
stood
up
looking
at
her
his
mother
sat
staring
at
them
in
turn
kate
recovered
first
please
excuse
me
she
said
she
laid
the
letters
on
a
small
table
and
turned
to
go
john
caught
his
mother
hand
closer
when
he
found
himself
holding
it
if
you
know
the
young
lady
mother
he
said
why
do
you
introduce
us
oh
i
was
so
bewildered
by
your
coming
she
said
kate
dear
let
me
present
my
son
kate
crossed
the
room
and
looking
straight
into
each
other
eyes
they
shook
hands
and
found
chairs
how
was
your
concert
my
dear
asked
jardine
i
do
think
it
was
very
good
said
kate
not
at
all
up
to
my
expectations
how
did
you
like
it
mr
jardine
was
that
a
concert
he
asked
it
was
supposed
to
be
said
kate
thank
you
for
the
information
he
said
i
did
see
it
i
hear
it
i
do
know
where
i
was
this
is
most
astonishing
said
kate
jardine
looked
at
her
son
her
eyes
two
big
imperative
question
marks
he
nodded
slightly
my
soul
she
cried
then
lay
back
in
her
chair
until
kate
feared
she
might
have
another
attack
of
heart
trouble
chapter
x
john
jardine
courtship
the
following
morning
they
breakfasted
together
under
the
branches
of
the
big
maple
tree
in
a
beautiful
world
jardine
was
so
happy
she
could
only
taste
a
bite
now
and
then
when
urged
to
kate
was
trying
to
keep
her
head
level
and
be
natural
john
jardine
wanted
to
think
of
everything
and
succeeded
fairly
well
it
seemed
to
kate
that
he
could
invent
more
ways
to
spend
money
and
spend
it
with
freer
hand
than
any
man
she
ever
had
heard
of
but
she
had
to
confess
that
the
men
she
had
heard
about
were
concerned
with
keeping
their
money
not
scattering
it
did
you
hear
unusual
sounds
when
john
came
to
bid
me
asked
jardine
of
kate
yes
laughed
kate
i
did
and
i
sure
i
made
a
fairly
accurate
guess
as
to
the
cause
what
did
you
think
asked
jardine
i
thought
jardine
had
missed
susette
and
you
had
to
tell
him
said
kate
you
quite
right
it
a
good
thing
she
went
on
and
lost
herself
in
new
york
i
not
at
all
sure
that
he
does
contemplate
starting
out
to
find
her
yet
let
susette
go
said
kate
we
interested
in
forgetting
her
there
a
little
country
here
who
wants
to
take
her
place
and
it
will
be
the
very
thing
for
your
mother
and
for
her
too
she
the
one
serving
us
notice
her
in
particular
if
she
a
teacher
how
does
she
come
to
be
serving
us
he
asked
i
a
teacher
how
do
i
come
to
be
dining
with
you
said
kate
this
is
such
a
queer
world
when
you
go
adventuring
in
it
jennie
had
a
small
school
in
an
out
county
a
widowed
mother
and
a
big
family
to
help
support
so
she
figured
that
the
only
way
she
could
come
here
to
try
to
prepare
herself
for
a
better
school
was
to
work
for
her
room
and
board
she
serves
the
table
two
hours
three
times
a
day
and
studies
between
times
she
tells
me
that
almost
every
waiter
in
the
dining
hall
is
a
teacher
please
watch
her
movements
and
manner
and
see
if
you
think
her
suitable
goodness
knows
she
is
intended
for
a
teacher
i
like
her
very
much
said
john
jardine
i
engage
her
as
soon
as
we
finish
kate
smiled
but
when
she
saw
the
ease
and
dexterity
with
which
he
ended
jennie
weeks
work
as
a
waiter
and
installed
her
as
his
maid
making
the
least
detail
all
right
with
his
mother
with
jennie
with
the
manager
she
realized
that
there
had
been
nothing
for
her
to
smile
about
jennie
was
delighted
and
began
her
new
undertaking
earnestly
with
sincere
desire
to
please
kate
helped
her
all
she
could
while
jardine
developed
a
fund
of
patience
commensurate
with
the
need
of
it
she
would
have
endured
more
inconvenience
than
resulted
from
jennie
inexperienced
hands
because
of
the
realization
that
her
son
and
the
girl
she
had
so
quickly
learned
to
admire
were
on
the
lake
rambling
the
woods
or
hearing
lectures
together
when
she
asked
him
how
long
he
could
remain
he
said
as
long
as
she
did
when
she
explained
that
she
was
enjoying
herself
thoroughly
and
had
no
idea
how
long
she
would
want
to
stay
he
said
that
was
all
right
he
had
only
had
one
vacation
in
his
life
it
was
time
he
was
having
another
when
she
marvelled
at
this
he
said
now
look
here
mother
let
get
this
business
straight
right
at
the
start
i
told
you
when
i
came
i
seen
the
woman
i
wanted
if
you
want
me
to
go
back
to
business
the
way
to
do
it
is
to
help
me
win
her
but
i
do
want
you
go
back
to
business
i
want
you
to
have
a
long
vacation
and
learn
all
you
can
from
the
educational
advantages
here
it
too
late
for
me
to
learn
more
than
i
get
every
day
by
knocking
around
and
meeting
people
i
tried
books
two
or
three
times
and
i
given
them
up
i
ca
do
it
i
waited
too
long
i
no
way
to
get
down
to
it
i
ca
remember
to
save
my
soul
but
you
can
remember
anything
on
earth
about
a
business
deal
she
urged
of
course
i
can
i
was
born
with
a
business
head
it
was
remember
or
starve
and
see
you
starve
if
i
had
the
books
at
the
time
they
would
have
helped
now
it
too
late
and
i
never
try
it
again
that
settled
much
as
i
want
to
marry
miss
bates
she
have
to
take
me
or
leave
me
as
i
am
i
ca
make
myself
over
for
her
or
for
you
i
would
if
i
could
but
that
one
of
the
things
i
ca
do
and
i
admit
it
if
i
not
good
enough
for
her
as
i
am
she
have
the
chance
to
tell
me
so
the
very
first
minute
i
think
it
proper
to
ask
her
john
you
are
good
enough
for
the
best
woman
on
earth
there
never
was
a
better
lad
it
is
that
and
you
know
it
i
am
so
anxious
that
i
can
scarcely
wait
but
you
must
wait
you
must
give
her
time
and
go
slowly
and
you
must
be
careful
oh
so
very
careful
she
a
teacher
and
a
student
she
came
here
to
study
i
fix
that
i
can
rush
things
so
that
there
be
no
time
to
study
you
make
a
mistake
if
you
try
it
you
far
better
let
her
go
her
own
way
and
only
appear
when
she
has
time
for
you
she
advised
that
a
fine
idea
he
cried
a
lot
of
ice
i
cut
sitting
back
waiting
for
a
signal
to
run
after
a
girl
like
a
poodle
the
way
to
do
is
the
same
as
with
any
business
deal
see
what
you
want
overcome
anything
in
your
way
and
get
it
i
go
crazy
hanging
around
like
that
you
always
told
me
i
could
do
the
things
in
business
i
said
i
would
and
i
always
proved
to
you
that
i
could
by
doing
them
now
watch
me
do
this
you
know
i
do
anything
to
help
you
john
you
know
how
proud
i
am
of
you
how
i
love
you
i
realize
now
that
i
talked
volumes
to
kate
about
you
i
told
her
everything
from
the
time
you
were
a
little
boy
and
i
slaved
for
you
until
now
when
you
slave
for
me
including
how
many
terms
i
gone
to
school
yes
i
even
told
her
that
she
said
well
what
did
she
seem
to
think
about
it
he
asked
i
do
know
what
she
thought
she
did
say
anything
there
was
nothing
to
say
it
was
a
fight
with
the
wolf
in
those
days
i
sure
i
made
her
understand
that
she
said
well
i
undertake
to
make
her
understand
this
he
said
are
you
sure
that
jennie
weeks
is
taking
good
care
of
you
jennie
is
well
enough
and
is
growing
better
each
day
now
be
off
to
your
courting
but
if
you
love
me
remember
and
be
careful
she
said
remember
one
particular
thing
you
mean
he
asked
she
nodded
her
lips
closed
you
bet
i
will
he
said
all
there
is
of
me
goes
into
this
she
a
wonder
mother
jardine
looked
closely
at
the
big
man
who
was
all
the
world
to
her
so
like
her
in
mentality
so
like
his
father
with
his
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
big
frame
looked
at
him
with
the
eyes
of
love
then
as
he
left
her
to
seek
the
girl
she
had
learned
to
love
she
shut
her
eyes
and
frankly
and
earnestly
asked
the
lord
to
help
her
son
to
marry
kate
bates
one
morning
as
kate
helped
jardine
into
her
coat
and
gloves
preparing
for
one
of
their
delightful
morning
drives
she
said
to
her
jardine
may
i
ask
you
a
real
question
of
course
you
may
said
jardine
and
i
shall
give
you
a
answer
if
it
lies
in
my
power
you
be
shocked
warned
kate
shock
away
laughed
jardine
by
now
i
flatter
myself
that
i
am
so
accustomed
to
you
that
you
will
have
to
try
yourself
to
shock
me
it
only
this
said
kate
if
you
were
a
perfect
stranger
standing
back
and
looking
on
not
acquainted
with
any
of
the
parties
merely
seeing
things
as
they
happen
each
day
would
it
be
your
honest
opinion
would
you
say
that
i
am
being
courted
jardine
laughed
until
she
was
weak
when
she
could
talk
she
said
yes
my
dear
under
the
conditions
and
in
the
circumstances
you
mention
i
would
cheerfully
go
on
oath
and
testify
that
you
are
being
courted
more
openly
more
vigorously
and
as
tenderly
as
i
ever
have
seen
woman
courted
in
all
my
life
i
always
thought
that
father
was
a
master
hand
at
courting
but
john
has
him
beaten
in
many
ways
yes
my
dear
you
certainly
are
being
courted
assiduously
now
then
on
that
basis
said
kate
just
one
more
question
and
we
proceed
with
our
drive
from
the
same
standpoint
would
you
say
from
your
observation
and
experience
that
the
mother
of
the
man
had
any
insurmountable
objection
to
the
proceedings
jardine
laughed
again
finally
she
said
no
my
dear
it
my
firm
conviction
that
the
mother
of
the
man
in
the
case
would
be
so
delighted
if
you
should
love
and
marry
her
son
that
she
would
probably
have
a
final
attack
of
heart
trouble
and
pass
away
from
sheer
joy
thank
you
said
kate
i
was
perfectly
sure
having
had
no
experience
whatever
and
i
did
want
to
make
a
mistake
that
drive
was
wonderful
over
beautiful
country
roads
through
dells
and
across
streams
and
hills
they
stopped
where
they
pleased
gathering
flowers
and
early
apples
visiting
with
people
they
met
lunching
wherever
they
happened
to
be
if
it
were
for
wishing
to
hear
john
logan
said
kate
i
move
that
we
drive
on
all
day
i
certainly
am
having
the
grandest
time
she
sat
with
her
sailor
hat
filled
with
early
harvest
apples
a
big
bunch
of
canadian
anemones
in
her
belt
a
little
stream
at
her
feet
july
drowsy
fullness
all
around
her
congenial
companions
taking
the
wings
of
morning
paid
after
all
why
do
you
want
to
hear
him
so
much
asked
john
kate
looked
up
at
him
in
wonder
do
you
want
to
see
and
hear
him
she
asked
he
hesitated
a
thoughtful
expression
on
his
face
finally
he
said
i
ca
say
that
i
do
will
you
tell
me
why
i
should
you
should
because
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
did
much
to
preserve
our
union
he
may
tell
us
interesting
things
about
the
war
where
were
you
when
it
was
the
proper
time
for
you
to
be
studying
the
speech
of
logan
ancestor
in
mcguffey
fourth
that
must
have
been
the
year
i
figured
out
the
improved
coupling
pin
in
the
shops
would
you
think
mother
somewhere
near
my
dear
she
said
so
they
drove
back
as
happily
as
they
had
set
out
made
themselves
fresh
and
while
awaiting
the
lecture
hour
kate
again
wrote
to
robert
and
nancy
ellen
telling
plainly
and
simply
all
that
had
occurred
she
even
wrote
john
jardine
mother
is
of
the
opinion
that
he
is
courting
me
i
am
so
lacking
in
experience
myself
that
i
scarcely
dare
venture
an
opinion
but
it
has
at
times
appealed
to
me
that
if
he
is
really
he
certainly
must
be
going
through
the
motions
nancy
ellen
wrote
i
have
read
over
what
you
say
about
john
jardine
several
times
then
i
had
robert
write
bradstreet
and
look
him
up
he
is
rated
so
high
that
if
he
has
a
million
right
now
he
soon
will
have
you
be
careful
and
do
your
level
best
are
your
clothes
good
enough
shall
i
send
more
of
my
things
you
know
i
do
anything
to
help
you
oh
yes
that
george
holt
from
your
boarding
place
was
here
the
other
day
hunting
you
he
seemed
determined
to
know
where
you
were
and
when
you
would
be
back
and
asked
for
your
address
i
did
think
you
had
any
time
for
him
and
i
could
endure
him
or
his
foolish
talk
about
a
new
medical
theory
so
i
said
you
no
time
for
writing
and
were
going
about
so
much
i
had
no
idea
if
you
get
a
letter
if
he
sent
one
and
i
did
give
him
what
he
wanted
he
probably
try
general
delivery
but
you
can
drop
it
in
the
lake
i
want
you
to
be
sure
to
change
your
boarding
place
this
winter
if
you
teach
but
i
have
an
idea
you
will
had
you
better
bring
matters
to
a
close
if
you
can
and
let
the
director
know
love
from
us
both
nancy
ellen
kate
sat
very
still
holding
this
letter
in
her
hand
when
john
jardine
came
up
and
sat
beside
her
she
looked
at
him
closely
he
was
quite
as
good
looking
as
his
mother
thought
him
in
a
brawny
masculine
way
but
kate
was
not
seeking
the
last
word
in
mental
or
physical
refinement
she
was
rather
brawny
herself
and
perfectly
aware
of
the
fact
she
wanted
intensely
to
learn
all
she
could
she
disliked
the
idea
that
any
woman
should
have
more
stored
in
her
head
than
she
but
she
had
no
time
to
study
minute
social
graces
and
customs
she
wanted
to
be
kind
to
be
polite
but
she
told
jardine
flatly
the
she
did
give
a
flip
about
being
overly
nice
which
was
the
exact
truth
that
required
subtleties
beyond
kate
depth
for
she
was
at
times
alarmingly
casual
so
she
held
her
letter
and
thought
about
john
jardine
as
she
thought
she
decided
that
she
did
not
know
whether
she
was
in
love
with
him
or
not
she
thought
she
was
she
liked
being
with
him
she
liked
all
he
did
for
her
she
would
miss
him
if
he
went
away
she
would
be
proud
to
be
his
wife
but
she
did
wish
that
he
were
interested
in
land
instead
of
inventions
and
stocks
and
bonds
stocks
and
bonds
were
almost
as
evanescent
as
rainbows
to
kate
land
was
something
she
could
understand
and
handle
maybe
she
could
interest
him
in
land
if
she
could
that
would
be
ideal
what
a
place
his
wealth
would
buy
and
fit
up
she
wondered
as
she
studied
john
jardine
what
was
in
his
head
if
he
truly
intended
to
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
and
since
reading
nancy
ellen
letter
when
she
should
let
the
trustee
know
if
she
were
not
going
to
teach
the
school
again
but
someway
she
rather
wanted
to
teach
the
school
when
she
started
anything
she
did
not
know
how
to
stop
until
she
finished
she
had
so
much
she
wanted
to
teach
her
pupils
the
coming
winter
suddenly
john
asked
kate
if
you
could
have
anything
you
wanted
what
would
you
have
two
hundred
acres
of
land
she
said
how
easy
laughed
john
rising
to
find
a
seat
for
his
mother
who
was
approaching
them
what
do
you
think
of
that
mother
a
girl
who
wants
two
hundred
acres
of
land
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
what
is
better
asked
jardine
i
never
heard
you
say
anything
about
land
before
certainly
not
said
his
mother
and
i
not
saying
anything
about
it
now
for
myself
but
i
can
see
why
it
means
so
much
to
kate
why
her
natural
element
well
i
ca
he
said
i
meet
many
men
in
business
who
started
on
land
and
most
of
them
were
mighty
glad
to
get
away
from
it
the
attraction
kate
waved
her
hand
toward
the
distance
oh
merely
sky
and
land
and
water
and
trees
and
birds
and
flowers
and
fruit
and
crops
and
a
few
other
things
scarcely
worth
mentioning
she
said
lightly
i
not
in
the
mood
to
talk
bushels
seed
and
fertilization
just
now
but
i
understand
them
they
are
in
my
blood
i
think
possibly
the
reason
i
want
two
hundred
acres
of
land
for
myself
is
because
i
been
hard
on
the
job
of
getting
them
for
other
people
ever
since
i
began
to
work
at
about
the
age
of
four
but
if
you
want
land
personally
why
did
you
work
to
get
it
for
yourself
asked
john
jardine
because
i
happened
to
be
the
omega
of
my
father
system
answered
kate
jardine
looked
at
her
interestedly
she
had
never
mentioned
her
home
or
parents
before
the
older
woman
did
not
intend
to
ask
a
word
but
if
kate
was
going
to
talk
she
did
not
want
to
miss
one
kate
evidently
was
going
to
talk
for
she
continued
you
see
my
father
is
land
mad
and
son
crazy
he
thinks
a
boy
of
all
the
importance
in
the
world
a
girl
of
none
whatever
he
has
the
biggest
family
of
any
one
we
know
from
birth
each
girl
is
worked
like
a
man
or
a
slave
from
four
in
the
morning
until
nine
at
night
each
boy
is
worked
exactly
the
same
way
the
difference
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
girls
get
plain
food
and
plainer
clothes
out
of
it
the
boys
each
get
two
hundred
acres
of
land
buildings
and
stock
that
the
girls
have
been
worked
to
the
limit
to
help
pay
for
they
get
nothing
personally
worth
mentioning
i
think
i
have
two
hundred
acres
of
land
on
the
brain
and
i
think
this
is
the
explanation
of
it
it
a
influence
at
our
house
while
we
nurse
eat
sleep
and
above
all
work
it
afterward
she
paused
and
looked
toward
john
jardine
calmly
i
think
she
said
that
there
not
a
task
ever
performed
on
a
farm
that
i
have
had
my
share
in
i
have
plowed
hoed
seeded
driven
reapers
and
bound
wheat
pitched
hay
and
hauled
manure
chopped
wood
and
sheared
sheep
and
boiled
sap
if
you
can
mention
anything
else
go
ahead
i
bet
a
dollar
i
done
it
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
muttered
looking
at
her
wonderingly
if
you
ask
me
and
want
the
answer
in
plain
words
i
think
it
a
shame
said
kate
if
it
were
one
hundred
acres
of
land
and
the
girls
had
as
much
and
were
as
willing
to
work
it
as
the
boys
are
well
and
good
but
to
drive
us
like
cattle
and
turn
all
we
earn
into
land
for
the
boys
is
another
matter
i
rebelled
last
summer
borrowed
the
money
and
went
to
normal
and
taught
last
winter
i
going
to
teach
again
this
winter
but
last
summer
and
this
are
the
first
of
my
life
that
i
have
been
in
the
harvest
fields
at
this
time
women
in
the
harvest
fields
of
land
king
bates
are
common
as
men
and
wagons
and
horses
but
not
nearly
so
much
considered
the
women
always
walk
on
sunday
to
save
the
horses
and
often
on
week
days
mother
has
it
hammered
into
me
that
it
is
polite
to
ask
questions
said
john
but
i
like
to
ask
one
go
ahead
said
kate
ask
fifty
what
do
i
care
how
many
boys
are
there
in
your
family
there
are
seven
said
kate
and
if
you
want
to
use
them
as
a
basis
for
a
land
estimate
add
two
hundred
and
fifty
for
the
home
place
sixteen
hundred
and
fifty
is
what
father
pays
tax
on
besides
the
numerous
mortgages
and
investments
he
the
richest
man
in
the
county
we
live
in
at
least
he
pays
the
most
taxes
mother
and
son
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
they
had
been
thinking
her
so
poor
that
she
would
be
bewildered
by
what
they
had
to
offer
but
if
two
hundred
acres
of
land
were
her
desire
there
was
a
possibility
that
she
was
a
women
who
was
not
asking
either
ease
or
luxury
of
life
and
would
refuse
it
if
it
were
proffered
i
hope
you
will
take
me
home
with
you
and
let
me
see
all
that
land
and
how
it
is
handled
said
john
jardine
i
do
own
an
acre
i
never
even
have
thought
of
it
but
there
is
no
reason
why
i
or
any
member
of
my
family
should
have
all
the
land
they
want
mother
do
you
feel
a
wild
desire
for
two
hundred
acres
of
land
same
kind
of
a
desire
that
took
you
to
come
here
no
i
do
said
jardine
all
i
know
about
land
is
that
i
know
it
when
i
see
it
and
i
know
if
i
think
it
pretty
but
i
can
see
why
kate
feels
that
she
would
like
that
amount
for
herself
after
having
helped
earn
all
those
farms
for
her
brothers
if
it
land
she
wants
i
hope
she
speedily
gets
all
she
desires
in
whatever
location
she
wants
it
and
then
i
hope
she
lets
me
come
to
visit
her
and
watch
her
do
as
she
likes
with
it
surely
said
kate
you
are
invited
right
now
as
soon
as
i
ever
get
the
land
i
give
you
another
invitation
and
of
course
you
may
go
home
with
me
jardine
and
i
show
you
each
of
what
father
calls
little
parcels
of
land
of
mine
but
the
one
he
lives
on
we
shall
have
to
gaze
at
from
afar
because
i
a
prodigal
daughter
when
i
would
leave
home
in
spite
of
him
for
the
gay
and
riotous
life
of
a
he
ordered
me
to
take
all
my
possessions
with
me
which
i
did
in
one
small
telescope
i
was
not
to
enter
his
house
again
while
he
lived
i
was
glad
to
go
he
was
glad
to
have
me
while
i
think
either
of
us
has
changed
our
mind
since
teaching
school
exactly
gay
but
i
fill
my
tummy
with
quite
a
lot
of
symbolical
husks
before
he
kill
the
fatted
calf
for
me
they
be
glad
to
see
you
at
my
brother
adam
and
my
sister
nancy
ellen
would
greatly
enjoy
meeting
you
surely
you
may
go
home
with
me
if
you
like
i
can
think
of
only
one
thing
i
like
better
he
said
we
been
such
good
friends
here
and
had
such
a
good
time
it
would
be
the
thing
i
like
best
to
take
you
home
with
us
and
show
you
where
and
how
we
live
mother
did
you
ever
invite
kate
to
visit
us
i
have
often
and
she
has
said
that
she
would
replied
jardine
i
think
it
would
be
nice
for
her
to
go
from
here
with
us
and
then
you
can
take
her
home
whenever
she
fails
to
find
us
interesting
how
would
that
suit
you
for
a
plan
my
dear
i
think
that
would
be
a
perfect
ending
to
a
perfect
summer
said
kate
i
ca
see
an
objection
in
any
way
thank
you
very
much
then
we
call
that
settled
said
john
jardine
chapter
xi
a
business
proposition
saw
them
on
their
way
to
chicago
kate
had
taken
care
of
jardine
a
few
days
while
jennie
weeks
went
home
to
see
her
mother
and
arrange
for
her
new
work
she
had
no
intention
of
going
back
to
school
teaching
she
preferred
to
brush
jardine
hair
button
her
shoes
write
her
letters
and
read
to
her
in
a
month
jennie
had
grown
so
deft
at
her
work
and
made
herself
so
appreciated
that
she
was
practically
indispensable
to
the
elderly
woman
and
therefore
the
greatest
comfort
to
john
immediately
he
saw
that
his
mother
was
properly
cared
for
sympathetically
and
even
lovingly
he
made
it
his
business
to
smooth
jennie
path
in
every
way
possible
in
turn
she
studied
him
and
in
many
ways
made
herself
useful
to
him
often
she
looked
at
him
with
large
and
speculative
eyes
as
he
sat
reading
letters
or
papers
or
smoking
the
world
was
all
right
with
kate
when
they
crossed
the
sand
dunes
as
they
neared
the
city
she
was
sorry
about
the
situation
in
her
home
but
she
smiled
sardonically
as
she
thought
how
soon
her
father
would
forget
his
anger
when
he
heard
about
the
city
home
and
the
kind
of
farm
she
could
have
merely
by
consenting
to
take
it
she
was
that
sure
of
john
jardine
yet
he
had
not
asked
her
to
marry
him
he
had
seemed
on
the
verge
of
it
a
dozen
times
and
then
had
paused
as
if
better
judgment
told
him
it
would
be
wise
to
wait
a
little
longer
now
kate
had
concluded
that
there
was
a
definite
thing
he
might
be
waiting
for
since
that
talk
about
land
she
thought
possibly
she
understood
what
it
was
he
was
a
business
man
he
knew
nothing
else
he
said
so
frankly
he
wanted
to
show
her
his
home
his
business
his
city
his
friends
and
then
he
required
he
had
almost
put
it
into
words
that
he
be
shown
her
home
and
her
people
kate
not
only
acquiesced
she
approved
she
wanted
to
know
as
much
of
a
man
she
married
as
nancy
ellen
had
known
and
robert
had
taken
her
to
his
home
and
told
his
people
she
was
his
betrothed
wife
before
he
married
her
kate
eyes
were
wide
open
and
her
brain
busy
as
they
entered
a
finely
appointed
carriage
and
she
heard
john
say
rather
sultry
home
down
the
lake
shore
george
she
wished
their
driver
had
not
been
named
george
but
after
all
it
made
no
difference
there
could
not
be
a
commoner
name
than
john
and
she
knew
of
but
one
that
she
liked
better
for
the
ensuing
three
days
she
lived
in
a
lake
shore
home
of
wealth
she
watched
closely
not
to
trip
in
the
heavy
rugs
and
carpets
she
looked
at
wonderful
paintings
and
long
shelves
of
books
she
never
had
touched
such
china
or
tasted
such
food
or
seen
so
good
service
she
understood
why
john
had
opposed
his
mother
undertaking
the
trip
without
him
for
everyone
in
the
house
seemed
busy
serving
the
little
woman
jennie
weeks
was
frankly
enchanted
my
sakes
she
said
to
kate
if
i
not
grateful
to
you
for
getting
me
into
a
place
like
this
i
would
give
it
up
for
all
the
in
the
world
i
going
to
snuggle
right
in
here
and
make
myself
so
useful
i
wo
have
to
leave
until
i
die
i
hope
you
wo
turn
me
out
when
to
come
to
take
charge
do
you
think
you
presuming
said
kate
jennie
drew
back
with
a
swift
apology
but
there
was
a
flash
in
the
little
eyes
and
a
spiteful
look
on
the
small
face
as
she
withdrew
then
kate
was
shown
each
of
john
wonderful
inventions
to
her
they
seemed
almost
miracles
because
they
were
so
obvious
so
simple
yet
brought
such
astounding
returns
she
saw
offices
and
heard
the
explanation
of
big
business
but
did
not
comprehend
farther
than
that
when
an
invention
was
completed
the
piling
up
of
money
began
before
the
week
visit
was
over
kate
was
trying
to
fit
herself
and
her
aims
and
objects
of
life
into
the
surroundings
with
no
success
whatever
she
felt
housed
in
cribbed
confined
frustrated
when
she
realized
that
she
was
becoming
plainly
cross
she
began
keen
and
soon
admitted
to
herself
that
she
did
not
belong
there
kate
watched
with
keen
eyes
repeatedly
she
tried
to
imagine
herself
in
such
surroundings
for
life
a
life
sentence
she
expressed
it
for
soon
she
understood
that
it
would
be
to
her
a
prison
the
only
way
she
could
imagine
herself
enduring
it
at
all
was
to
think
of
the
promised
farm
and
when
she
began
to
think
of
that
on
jardine
terms
she
saw
that
it
would
mean
to
sit
down
and
tell
someone
else
what
she
wanted
done
there
would
be
no
battle
to
fight
her
mind
kept
harking
back
to
the
day
when
she
had
said
to
john
that
she
hoped
there
would
be
a
lake
on
the
land
she
owned
and
he
had
answered
casually
if
there
is
a
lake
make
one
kate
thought
that
over
repeatedly
make
one
make
a
lake
it
would
have
seemed
no
more
magical
to
her
if
he
had
said
make
a
cloud
make
a
star
or
make
a
rainbow
what
on
earth
would
i
do
with
myself
with
my
time
with
my
life
pondered
kate
she
said
to
jardine
and
jennie
weeks
and
started
home
with
john
still
pondering
when
the
train
pulled
into
hartley
nancy
ellen
and
robert
were
on
the
platform
to
meet
them
from
that
time
kate
was
on
solid
ground
she
was
reckoning
in
terms
she
could
comprehend
all
her
former
assurance
and
energy
came
back
to
her
she
almost
wished
the
visit
were
over
and
that
she
were
on
the
way
to
walton
to
clean
the
she
was
eager
to
roll
her
sleeves
and
beat
a
tub
of
soapy
clothes
to
foam
and
boil
them
snowy
white
she
had
a
desire
she
could
scarcely
control
to
sweep
and
dust
and
cook
she
had
been
out
of
the
environment
she
thought
she
disliked
and
found
when
she
returned
to
it
after
a
wider
change
than
she
could
have
imagined
that
she
did
not
dislike
it
at
all
it
was
her
element
her
work
what
she
knew
she
could
attempt
it
with
sure
foot
capable
hand
and
certain
knowledge
sunday
morning
she
said
to
nancy
ellen
as
they
washed
the
breakfast
dishes
while
the
men
smoked
on
the
veranda
nancy
ellen
i
believe
i
was
ever
cut
out
for
a
rich
woman
if
i
have
got
a
chance
i
wish
you
had
it
and
i
had
this
this
just
suits
my
style
to
a
tell
me
about
it
said
nancy
ellen
kate
told
all
she
could
remember
you
do
mean
to
say
you
did
like
it
cried
nancy
ellen
i
did
say
anything
said
kate
but
if
i
were
saying
exactly
what
i
feel
you
know
i
despise
it
all
why
kate
barnes
cried
the
horrified
nancy
ellen
whatever
do
you
mean
i
have
thought
enough
to
put
it
to
you
clearly
said
kate
but
someway
the
city
repels
me
facilities
for
manufacturing
something
start
a
city
it
begins
with
the
men
who
do
the
work
and
the
men
who
profit
from
that
work
living
in
the
same
coop
it
expands
and
goes
on
and
grows
on
that
basis
it
the
laborer
living
on
his
hire
and
the
manufacturer
living
on
the
laborer
productions
coming
in
daily
contact
the
contrast
is
too
great
the
space
is
too
small
somebody
is
going
to
get
the
life
crowded
out
of
him
at
every
turn
and
it
is
always
the
work
hand
in
the
factory
the
money
kings
eat
each
other
for
breakfast
every
day
as
for
work
we
always
thought
we
worked
you
should
take
a
peep
into
the
shops
and
factories
i
seen
this
week
work
why
we
do
know
what
work
is
and
we
waste
enough
food
every
day
to
keep
a
workman
family
and
we
dressed
liked
queens
in
comparison
with
them
right
now
do
you
mean
to
say
if
he
asks
you
it
was
a
small
explosion
i
mean
to
say
if
he
asks
me
me
that
two
hundred
acres
of
land
where
i
want
it
build
me
the
house
and
barns
i
want
and
guarantee
that
i
may
live
there
as
i
please
and
i
marry
you
if
it
chicago
never
i
have
stolen
murdered
or
betrayed
who
should
i
be
imprisoned
why
you
hopeless
anarchist
said
nancy
ellen
i
am
going
to
tell
john
jardine
on
you
do
urged
kate
sound
him
on
the
land
question
it
our
only
hope
of
a
common
foundation
have
you
send
agatha
word
that
we
will
be
out
this
afternoon
i
have
said
nancy
ellen
and
i
do
doubt
that
now
even
now
she
is
in
the
kitchen
how
would
she
put
it
a
cake
said
kate
while
adam
is
in
the
cellar
a
custard
adam
will
be
raking
the
yard
afresh
and
susan
will
be
sweeping
the
walks
steadily
from
now
until
they
sight
us
coming
down
the
road
what
you
bet
agatha
asked
john
his
intentions
i
almost
wish
she
would
she
added
he
has
some
but
there
is
a
string
to
them
in
some
way
and
i
ca
just
make
out
where
or
why
it
is
not
even
a
guess
asked
nancy
ellen
not
even
a
guess
with
any
sense
to
it
i
thought
it
was
coming
repeatedly
but
i
got
a
stubborn
bates
streak
and
i
wo
lift
a
finger
to
help
him
he
speak
up
loud
and
plain
or
there
will
be
no
bliss
for
us
as
agatha
says
i
think
he
has
ideas
about
other
things
than
freight
train
gear
according
to
his
programme
we
must
have
so
much
time
to
become
acquainted
i
must
see
his
home
and
people
he
must
see
mine
if
there
more
after
that
i
not
informed
like
as
not
there
is
it
may
come
after
we
get
back
i
ca
say
have
you
told
him
asked
nancy
ellen
not
the
details
but
the
essentials
he
knows
that
i
ca
go
home
it
came
up
one
day
in
talking
about
land
i
guess
they
had
thought
before
that
my
people
were
poor
as
church
mice
i
happened
to
mention
how
much
land
i
had
helped
earn
for
my
brothers
and
they
seemed
so
interested
i
finished
the
job
well
after
they
had
heard
about
the
land
king
it
made
a
noticeable
difference
in
their
treatment
of
me
not
that
they
were
always
fine
but
it
made
i
scarcely
know
how
to
put
it
it
was
so
intangible
but
it
was
a
difference
an
added
respect
you
bet
money
is
a
power
i
can
see
why
father
hangs
on
to
those
deeds
when
i
get
out
in
the
world
they
are
his
compensation
for
his
years
of
hard
work
the
material
evidence
that
he
has
succeeded
in
what
he
undertook
he
show
them
to
john
jardine
with
the
same
feeling
john
showed
me
improved
car
couplers
brakes
and
air
cushions
they
stand
for
successes
that
win
the
deference
of
men
out
in
the
little
bit
of
world
i
seen
i
notice
that
men
fight
bleed
and
die
for
even
a
tiny
fraction
of
deference
are
they
funny
what
would
i
care
well
i
care
a
lot
said
nancy
ellen
kate
surveyed
her
slowly
yes
i
guess
you
would
they
finished
the
dishes
and
went
to
church
because
robert
was
accustomed
to
going
they
made
a
remarkable
group
then
they
went
to
the
hotel
for
dinner
so
that
the
girls
would
not
have
to
prepare
it
and
then
in
a
double
carriage
robert
had
secured
for
the
occasion
they
drove
to
bates
corners
and
as
kate
said
viewed
the
landscape
those
eight
pieces
of
land
none
under
two
hundred
acres
some
slightly
over
all
in
the
very
highest
state
of
cultivation
with
modern
houses
barns
outbuildings
and
fine
stock
grazing
in
the
pastures
made
an
impressive
picture
it
was
probably
the
first
time
that
any
of
the
bates
girls
had
seen
it
all
at
once
and
looked
on
it
merely
as
a
spectacle
they
stopped
at
adam
last
and
while
robert
was
busy
with
the
team
and
john
had
alighted
to
help
him
nancy
ellen
revealing
tight
lips
and
unnaturally
red
cheeks
leaned
back
to
kate
this
is
about
as
mean
a
trick
and
as
big
a
shame
as
i
ever
seen
she
said
hotly
you
know
i
was
brought
up
with
this
and
i
never
looked
at
it
with
the
eyes
of
a
stranger
before
if
ever
i
get
my
fingers
on
those
deeds
i
make
short
work
of
them
and
a
good
job
too
assented
kate
instantly
look
out
there
comes
adam
i
just
as
soon
tell
him
so
as
not
whispered
nancy
ellen
which
would
result
in
the
deeds
being
recorded
and
spoiling
our
trip
and
what
good
would
it
do
you
said
kate
none
of
course
nothing
ever
does
a
bates
girl
any
good
unless
she
gets
out
and
does
it
for
herself
retorted
nancy
ellen
spitefully
there
there
said
robert
as
he
came
to
help
nancy
ellen
protect
her
skirts
in
alighting
i
was
afraid
this
trip
would
breed
discontent
what
the
trouble
asked
john
as
he
performed
the
same
service
for
kate
oh
the
girls
are
grouching
a
little
because
they
helped
earn
all
this
and
are
to
be
left
out
of
it
explained
robert
in
a
low
voice
let
get
each
one
of
them
a
farm
that
will
lay
any
of
these
completely
in
the
shade
suggested
john
all
right
for
you
if
you
can
do
it
said
robert
laughing
but
gone
my
limit
for
the
present
besides
if
you
gave
each
of
them
two
hundred
acres
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
would
stop
them
from
feeling
that
they
had
been
defrauded
of
their
birthright
here
how
would
you
feel
if
you
was
served
the
same
way
asked
john
and
even
as
she
shook
hands
with
adam
and
introduced
john
jardine
kate
found
herself
wishing
that
he
had
said
were
as
the
girls
had
predicted
the
place
was
immaculate
the
yard
shady
and
cool
from
the
shelter
of
many
big
trees
the
house
comfortable
convenient
the
best
of
everything
in
sight
agatha
and
susan
were
in
new
white
dresses
while
adam
and
wore
tan
and
white
striped
seersucker
coats
and
white
duck
trousers
it
was
not
difficult
to
feel
a
glow
of
pride
in
the
place
and
people
adam
made
them
cordially
welcome
you
undoubtedly
are
blessed
with
good
fortune
said
agatha
you
please
enlighten
us
concerning
your
travels
katherine
so
kate
told
them
everything
she
could
think
of
that
she
thought
would
interest
and
amuse
them
even
outlining
for
agatha
speeches
she
had
heard
made
by
vincent
chaplain
mccabe
jehu
dewitt
miller
a
number
of
famous
politicians
teachers
and
ministers
then
all
of
them
talked
about
everything
adam
took
john
and
robert
to
look
over
the
farm
whereupon
kate
handed
over
her
hat
for
agatha
to
finger
and
try
on
and
how
long
will
it
be
my
dear
said
agatha
to
kate
before
you
enter
connubial
bliss
my
goodness
i
glad
you
asked
me
that
while
the
men
are
at
the
barn
said
kate
jardine
has
said
a
word
about
it
himself
so
please
be
careful
what
you
say
before
him
agatha
looked
at
kate
in
wonder
you
amaze
me
she
said
why
he
regards
you
as
if
he
would
devour
you
he
has
proposed
for
your
hand
you
say
surely
you
not
giving
him
proper
encouragement
she
is
giving
him
any
further
than
allowing
him
to
be
around
said
nancy
ellen
do
enlighten
me
cried
the
surprised
agatha
how
astonishing
why
kate
my
dear
there
is
a
just
and
proper
amount
of
encouragement
that
must
be
given
any
youth
before
he
makes
his
declarations
you
surely
know
that
no
i
do
not
know
it
said
kate
i
thought
it
was
a
man
place
to
speak
up
loud
and
plain
and
say
what
he
had
to
propose
oh
dear
wailed
agatha
wringing
her
thin
hands
her
face
a
mirror
of
distress
oh
dear
i
very
much
fear
you
will
lose
him
why
katherine
after
a
man
has
been
to
see
you
a
certain
number
of
times
and
evidenced
enough
interest
in
you
my
dear
there
are
a
thousand
strictly
womanly
ways
in
which
you
can
lend
his
enterprise
a
little
only
a
faint
amount
of
encouragement
just
enough
to
allow
him
to
recognize
that
he
is
not
not
er
repulsive
to
you
but
how
many
times
must
he
come
and
how
much
interest
must
he
evince
asked
kate
i
can
scarcely
name
an
exact
number
said
agatha
that
is
personal
you
must
decide
for
yourself
what
is
the
psychological
moment
at
which
he
is
to
be
taken
have
you
even
signified
to
him
that
you
that
you
that
you
could
be
induced
even
to
contemplate
marriage
oh
yes
said
kate
heartily
i
told
his
mother
that
it
was
the
height
of
my
ambition
to
marry
by
the
time
i
twenty
i
told
her
i
wanted
a
man
as
tall
as
i
am
two
hundred
acres
of
land
and
at
least
twelve
babies
agatha
collapsed
suddenly
she
turned
her
shocked
face
toward
nancy
ellen
great
day
of
rest
she
cried
no
wonder
the
man
does
propose
when
the
men
returned
from
their
stroll
agatha
and
susan
served
them
with
delicious
frozen
custard
and
angel
food
cake
then
they
resumed
their
drive
passing
hiram
place
last
at
the
corner
robert
hesitated
and
turned
to
ask
shall
we
go
ahead
kate
certainly
said
kate
i
want
jardine
to
see
where
i
was
born
and
spent
my
time
of
legal
servitude
i
suppose
we
dare
stop
i
doubt
if
mother
would
want
to
see
me
and
i
have
the
slightest
doubt
that
father
would
not
but
he
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
road
the
shortest
way
and
besides
i
want
to
see
the
lilac
bush
and
the
cabbage
roses
as
they
approached
the
place
nancy
ellen
turned
father
standing
at
the
gate
what
shall
we
do
there
nothing
you
can
do
but
drive
straight
ahead
and
you
and
robert
speak
to
him
said
kate
go
fast
robert
he
touched
the
team
and
at
fair
speed
they
whirled
past
the
white
house
at
the
gate
of
which
stiffly
erect
stood
a
brawny
man
of
six
feet
six
his
face
ruddy
and
healthy
in
appearance
he
was
dressed
as
he
prepared
himself
to
take
a
trip
to
pay
his
taxes
or
to
go
to
court
he
stood
squarely
erect
with
stern
forbidding
face
looking
directly
at
them
robert
spoke
to
him
and
nancy
ellen
leaned
forward
and
waved
calling
father
that
she
might
be
sure
he
knew
her
but
he
gave
not
the
slightest
sign
of
recognition
they
carried
away
a
distinct
picture
of
him
at
his
best
physically
and
in
appearance
at
his
worst
mentally
there
you
have
it
said
kate
bitterly
i
be
safe
in
wagering
a
thousand
dollars
if
i
had
it
that
agatha
or
the
children
told
at
hiram
or
to
mother
girl
that
we
were
coming
they
knew
we
would
pass
about
this
time
mother
was
at
the
side
door
watching
and
father
was
in
his
sunday
best
waiting
to
show
us
what
would
happen
if
we
stopped
and
that
he
never
changes
his
mind
it
did
happen
by
accident
that
he
was
standing
there
dressed
that
way
what
do
you
think
nancy
ellen
that
he
was
watching
for
us
said
nancy
ellen
but
why
do
you
suppose
that
he
did
it
asked
kate
he
thought
that
if
he
were
not
standing
guard
there
we
might
stop
in
the
road
and
at
least
call
mother
out
he
wanted
to
be
seen
and
seen
at
his
best
but
as
always
in
command
showing
his
authority
do
mind
said
john
jardine
it
easy
to
understand
the
situation
thank
you
said
kate
i
hope
you
tell
your
mother
that
i
bear
her
to
think
that
the
trouble
is
wholly
my
fault
no
danger
of
that
he
said
mother
thinks
there
nobody
in
all
the
world
like
you
and
so
do
i
nancy
ellen
kicked
robert
shin
to
let
him
know
that
she
heard
kate
was
very
depressed
for
a
time
but
she
soon
recovered
and
they
spent
a
final
happy
evening
together
when
john
had
parted
from
robert
and
nancy
ellen
with
the
arrangement
that
he
was
to
come
again
the
following
saturday
evening
and
spend
sunday
with
them
he
asked
kate
to
walk
a
short
distance
with
him
he
seemed
to
be
debating
some
proposition
in
his
mind
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
approach
finally
he
stopped
abruptly
and
said
kate
mother
told
me
that
she
told
you
how
i
grew
up
we
have
been
together
most
of
every
day
for
six
weeks
i
have
no
idea
how
a
man
used
to
women
goes
at
what
i
want
so
i
can
only
do
what
i
think
is
right
and
best
and
above
all
honest
and
fair
i
be
the
happiest
i
ever
been
to
do
anything
on
earth
got
the
money
to
do
for
you
there
a
question
i
going
to
ask
you
the
next
time
i
come
you
can
think
over
all
you
know
of
me
and
of
mother
and
of
what
we
have
and
are
and
be
ready
to
tell
me
how
you
feel
about
everything
next
sunday
there
one
question
i
want
to
ask
you
before
i
go
in
case
we
can
plan
for
a
life
together
next
sunday
what
about
my
mother
whatever
pleases
her
best
of
course
said
kate
any
arrangement
that
you
feel
will
make
her
happy
will
be
all
right
with
me
in
the
event
we
agree
on
other
things
he
laughed
shortly
this
sounds
and
he
said
but
been
all
the
world
to
me
until
i
met
you
i
must
be
sure
about
her
and
one
other
thing
i
write
you
about
that
this
week
if
that
is
all
right
with
you
you
can
get
ready
for
a
deluge
i
held
in
as
long
as
i
can
kate
will
you
kiss
me
that
against
the
rules
said
kate
that
getting
the
cart
before
the
horse
i
know
it
he
said
but
have
i
been
an
example
for
six
weeks
only
one
please
they
were
back
at
gray
gate
standing
in
the
deep
shelter
of
a
big
maple
kate
said
i
make
a
bargain
with
you
i
kiss
you
and
if
we
come
to
an
agreement
next
sunday
night
you
shall
kiss
me
is
that
all
right
the
reply
was
so
indistinct
kate
was
not
sure
of
it
but
she
took
his
face
between
her
hands
and
gave
him
exactly
the
same
kind
of
kiss
she
would
have
given
adam
she
hesitated
an
instant
then
gave
him
a
second
you
may
take
that
to
your
mother
she
said
and
fled
up
the
walk
chapter
xii
two
letters
nancy
ellen
and
robert
were
sitting
on
the
side
porch
not
seeming
in
the
least
sleepy
when
kate
entered
the
house
as
she
stepped
out
to
them
she
found
them
laughing
mysteriously
take
this
chair
kate
said
nancy
ellen
come
on
robert
let
go
stand
under
the
maple
tree
and
let
her
see
whether
she
can
see
us
if
you
going
to
rehearse
any
momentous
moment
of
your
existence
said
kate
i
should
think
of
even
being
on
the
porch
i
shall
keep
discreetly
in
the
house
even
going
at
once
to
bed
pleasant
dreams
now
we
made
her
angry
said
robert
i
think
there
was
little
touch
of
asperity
as
agatha
would
say
in
that
said
nancy
ellen
but
kate
has
a
good
heart
she
get
over
it
before
morning
would
agatha
use
such
a
common
word
as
asked
robert
indeed
no
said
nancy
ellen
she
would
say
but
all
the
same
he
kissed
her
if
she
did
step
up
and
kiss
him
never
again
shall
i
trust
my
eyes
said
the
doctor
hush
cautioned
nancy
ellen
she
provoked
now
if
she
hears
that
she
never
forgive
us
kate
did
not
need
even
a
hint
to
start
her
talking
in
the
morning
the
day
was
fine
a
snappy
tinge
of
autumn
in
the
air
her
head
and
heart
were
full
nancy
ellen
would
understand
and
sympathize
of
course
kate
told
her
all
there
was
to
tell
and
even
at
that
said
nancy
ellen
he
has
just
come
out
right
square
and
said
will
you
marry
me
as
i
understand
it
same
here
laughed
kate
he
said
he
had
to
be
sure
about
his
mother
and
there
was
other
thing
he
write
me
about
this
week
and
he
come
again
next
sunday
then
if
things
were
all
right
with
me
the
deluge
and
what
is
other
thing
asked
nancy
ellen
there
he
has
me
guessing
we
had
six
long
lovely
weeks
of
daily
association
at
the
lake
i
seen
his
home
and
his
inventions
and
as
much
of
his
business
as
is
visible
to
the
eye
of
a
woman
who
know
a
tinker
about
business
his
mother
has
told
me
minutely
of
his
life
every
day
since
he
was
born
i
think
she
insists
that
he
never
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
a
girl
before
and
he
says
the
same
so
there
ca
be
any
hidden
ugly
feature
to
mar
my
joy
he
is
thoughtful
quick
kind
a
business
man
he
looks
well
enough
he
acts
like
a
gentleman
he
seldom
makes
a
mistake
in
speech
he
does
say
enough
to
make
any
mistakes
i
have
yet
heard
him
talk
freely
give
an
opinion
or
discuss
a
question
said
nancy
ellen
neither
have
i
said
kate
he
very
silent
thinking
out
more
inventions
maybe
the
worst
thing
about
him
is
a
kind
of
he
got
it
fighting
for
his
mother
from
boyhood
he
knew
she
would
freeze
and
starve
if
he
did
take
care
of
her
he
had
to
do
it
he
soon
found
he
could
it
took
money
to
do
what
he
had
to
do
he
got
the
money
then
he
began
performing
miracles
with
it
he
lifted
his
mother
out
of
poverty
he
dressed
her
purple
and
fine
linen
he
housed
her
in
the
same
kind
of
home
other
rich
men
of
the
lake
shore
drive
live
in
and
gave
her
the
same
kind
of
service
as
most
men
do
when
things
begin
to
come
their
way
he
lived
for
making
money
alone
he
was
so
keen
on
the
chase
he
would
stop
to
educate
and
culture
himself
he
drove
headlong
on
and
on
piling
up
more
far
more
than
any
one
man
should
be
allowed
to
have
so
you
can
see
that
it
is
strange
that
he
thinks
there
nothing
on
earth
that
money
do
you
can
see
that
sticking
out
all
over
him
at
the
hotel
on
boats
on
the
trains
anywhere
we
went
he
pushed
straight
for
the
most
conspicuous
place
the
most
desirable
thing
the
most
expensive
i
almost
prayed
sometimes
that
in
some
way
he
would
strike
one
single
thing
that
he
could
make
come
his
way
with
money
but
he
never
did
no
i
have
an
idea
what
he
has
in
his
mind
yet
but
he
going
to
write
me
about
it
this
week
and
if
i
agree
to
whatever
it
is
he
is
coming
sunday
then
he
has
threatened
me
with
a
whatever
he
means
by
that
he
means
providing
another
teacher
for
walden
taking
you
to
chicago
shopping
for
a
wonderful
trousseau
marrying
you
in
his
lake
shore
palace
no
doubt
well
if
that
what
he
means
by
a
said
kate
he
find
the
flood
coming
his
way
he
strike
the
first
thing
he
ca
do
with
money
i
shall
teach
my
school
this
winter
as
i
agreed
to
i
shall
marry
him
in
the
clothes
i
buy
with
what
i
earn
i
shall
marry
him
quietly
here
or
at
adam
or
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
if
neither
of
you
wants
me
he
ca
pick
me
up
and
carry
me
away
and
dress
me
and
marry
me
as
if
i
were
a
pauper
you
right
about
it
said
nancy
ellen
i
do
know
how
we
came
to
be
so
different
i
should
do
at
once
any
way
he
suggested
to
get
such
a
man
and
that
much
money
that
it
would
be
a
humiliation
to
me
all
my
after
life
i
would
think
about
until
the
humiliation
began
and
then
i
have
no
way
to
protect
myself
right
but
i
get
out
of
teaching
this
winter
if
i
could
i
love
to
have
you
here
but
i
must
teach
to
the
earn
money
for
my
outfit
i
have
to
go
back
to
school
in
the
same
old
sailor
do
you
care
laughed
nancy
ellen
we
know
a
secret
that
we
do
agreed
kate
wednesday
kate
noticed
nancy
ellen
watching
for
the
boy
robert
had
promised
to
send
with
the
mail
as
soon
as
it
was
distributed
because
she
was
herself
twice
thursday
kate
hoped
in
vain
that
the
suspense
would
be
over
it
had
to
end
friday
if
john
were
coming
saturday
night
she
began
to
resent
the
length
of
time
he
was
waiting
it
was
like
him
to
wait
until
the
last
minute
and
then
depend
on
money
to
carry
him
through
he
is
giving
me
a
long
time
to
think
things
over
kate
said
to
nancy
ellen
when
there
was
no
letter
in
the
afternoon
mail
thursday
it
may
have
been
lost
or
delayed
said
nancy
ellen
it
will
come
surely
both
of
them
saw
the
boy
turn
in
at
the
gate
friday
morning
each
saw
that
he
carried
more
than
one
letter
nancy
ellen
was
on
her
feet
and
nearer
to
the
door
she
stepped
to
it
and
took
the
letters
giving
them
a
hasty
glance
as
she
handed
them
to
kate
two
she
said
tersely
one
with
the
address
written
in
the
clear
bold
hand
of
a
gentleman
and
one
the
straggle
of
a
country
kate
smiled
as
she
took
the
letters
i
wager
my
hat
which
is
my
most
precious
possession
she
said
that
the
one
with
the
beautifully
written
address
comes
from
the
and
the
from
the
she
glanced
at
the
stamping
and
addresses
and
smiled
again
so
it
proves
she
said
while
i
about
it
i
see
what
the
has
to
say
and
then
i
shall
be
free
to
give
my
whole
attention
to
the
oh
kate
how
can
you
cried
nancy
ellen
way
i
made
i
said
kate
anyway
that
the
way
this
is
going
to
be
done
she
dropped
the
big
square
letter
in
her
lap
and
ran
her
finger
under
the
flap
of
the
long
thin
beautifully
addressed
envelope
and
drew
forth
several
quite
as
perfectly
written
sheets
she
read
them
slowly
and
deliberately
sometimes
turning
back
a
page
and
going
over
a
part
of
it
again
when
she
finished
she
glanced
at
nancy
ellen
while
slowly
folding
the
sheets
just
for
half
a
cent
i
ask
you
to
read
this
she
said
i
certainly
sha
pay
anything
for
the
privilege
but
i
read
it
if
you
want
me
to
offered
nancy
ellen
all
right
go
ahead
said
kate
it
might
possibly
teach
you
that
you
ca
always
judge
a
man
by
appearance
or
hastily
though
just
why
george
holt
looks
more
like
a
than
adam
or
hiram
or
andrew
it
passes
me
to
tell
she
handed
nancy
ellen
the
letter
and
slowly
ripped
open
the
flap
of
the
heavy
white
envelope
she
drew
forth
the
sheet
and
sat
an
instant
with
it
in
her
fingers
watching
the
expression
of
nancy
ellen
face
while
she
read
the
most
restrained
yet
impassioned
plea
that
a
man
of
george
holt
nature
and
opportunities
could
devise
to
make
to
a
woman
after
having
spent
several
months
in
the
construction
of
it
it
was
a
masterly
letter
perfectly
composed
spelled
and
written
for
among
his
other
fields
of
endeavour
george
holt
had
taught
several
terms
of
country
school
and
taught
them
with
much
success
so
that
he
might
have
become
a
fine
instructor
had
it
been
in
his
blood
to
stick
to
anything
long
enough
to
make
it
succeed
after
a
page
as
she
turned
the
second
sheet
nancy
ellen
glanced
at
kate
and
saw
that
she
had
not
opened
the
creased
page
in
her
hands
she
flamed
with
sudden
irritation
you
do
beat
the
band
she
cried
you
watched
for
two
days
and
been
provoked
because
that
letter
did
come
now
you
got
it
there
you
sit
like
a
mummy
and
let
your
mind
be
so
filled
with
this
idiotic
drivel
that
you
not
ever
reading
john
jardine
letter
that
is
to
tell
you
what
both
of
us
are
crazy
to
know
if
you
were
in
any
mood
to
be
fair
and
honest
you
admit
that
you
never
read
a
finer
letter
than
that
said
kate
as
for
this
i
never
was
so
afraid
in
all
my
life
look
at
that
she
threw
the
envelope
in
nancy
ellen
lap
that
is
the
very
first
line
of
john
jardine
writing
i
have
ever
seen
she
said
do
you
see
anything
about
it
to
encourage
me
to
go
farther
you
goose
cried
the
exasperated
nancy
ellen
i
suppose
he
transacts
so
much
business
he
scarcely
ever
puts
pen
to
paper
the
difference
how
he
writes
look
at
what
he
is
and
what
he
does
go
on
and
read
his
letter
kate
arose
and
walked
to
the
window
turning
her
back
to
nancy
ellen
who
sat
staring
at
her
while
she
read
john
jardine
letter
once
nancy
ellen
saw
kate
throw
up
her
head
and
twist
her
neck
as
if
she
were
choking
then
she
heard
a
great
gulping
sob
down
in
her
throat
finally
kate
turned
and
stared
at
her
with
dazed
incredulous
eyes
slowly
she
dropped
the
letter
deliberately
set
her
foot
on
it
and
leaving
the
room
climbed
the
stairs
nancy
ellen
threw
george
letter
aside
and
snatched
up
john
jardine
she
read
my
derest
kate
i
am
a
day
late
with
this
becos
as
i
told
you
i
have
no
schooling
and
in
writing
a
letter
is
where
i
prove
it
so
i
never
write
them
but
it
was
not
fare
to
you
for
you
not
to
know
what
kind
of
a
letter
i
would
write
if
i
did
write
one
so
here
it
is
very
bad
no
dout
but
the
best
i
can
possably
do
which
has
got
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
my
pashion
for
you
and
the
aughful
time
i
will
have
till
i
here
from
you
if
you
can
stand
for
this
telagraf
me
and
i
will
come
first
train
and
we
will
forget
this
and
i
will
never
write
another
letter
with
derest
love
from
mother
and
from
me
all
the
love
of
my
hart
forever
yours
only
john
jardine
the
writing
would
have
been
a
discredit
to
a
schoolboy
nancy
ellen
threw
the
letter
back
on
the
floor
with
a
stiffly
extended
finger
she
poked
it
into
the
position
in
which
she
thought
she
had
found
it
and
slowly
stepped
back
great
god
she
said
amazedly
what
does
the
man
mean
where
does
that
dainty
and
wonderful
little
mother
come
in
she
must
be
a
regular
parasite
to
take
such
ease
and
comfort
for
herself
out
of
him
and
not
see
that
he
had
time
and
chance
to
do
better
than
that
for
himself
kate
will
never
endure
it
never
in
the
world
and
by
the
luck
of
the
very
devil
there
comes
that
thing
in
the
same
mail
from
that
abominable
george
holt
and
kate
reads
it
first
it
too
bad
i
ca
believe
it
what
did
his
mother
mean
suddenly
nancy
ellen
began
to
cry
bitterly
between
sobs
she
could
hear
kate
as
she
walked
from
closet
and
bureau
to
her
trunk
which
she
was
packing
the
lid
slammed
heavily
and
a
few
minutes
later
kate
entered
the
room
dressed
for
the
street
why
are
you
weeping
she
asked
casually
her
eyes
were
flaming
her
cheeks
scarlet
and
her
lips
twitching
nancy
ellen
sat
up
and
looked
at
her
she
pointed
to
the
letter
i
read
that
she
said
well
what
do
i
care
said
kate
if
he
has
no
more
respect
for
me
than
to
write
me
such
an
insult
as
that
why
should
i
have
the
respect
for
him
to
protect
him
in
it
publish
it
in
the
paper
if
you
want
to
kate
what
are
you
going
to
do
demanded
nancy
ellen
three
things
said
kate
slowly
putting
on
her
long
silk
gloves
first
i
going
to
telegraph
john
jardine
that
i
never
shall
see
him
again
if
i
can
possibly
avoid
it
second
i
going
to
send
a
drayman
to
get
my
trunk
and
take
it
to
walden
third
i
going
to
start
out
and
walk
miles
i
do
know
or
care
where
but
in
the
end
i
going
to
walden
to
clean
the
schoolhouse
and
get
ready
for
my
winter
term
of
school
oh
kate
you
are
such
a
fine
teacher
teach
him
do
be
so
hurried
take
more
time
to
think
you
will
break
his
heart
pleaded
nancy
ellen
kate
threw
out
both
hands
palms
down
she
slowly
spelled
out
the
letters
what
about
my
heart
and
my
pride
think
i
can
respect
that
or
ask
my
children
to
respect
it
but
thank
you
and
robert
and
come
after
me
as
often
as
you
can
as
a
mercy
to
me
if
john
persists
in
coming
to
try
to
buy
me
as
he
thinks
he
can
buy
anything
he
wants
you
need
let
him
come
to
walden
for
probably
i
wo
be
there
until
i
have
to
and
i
wo
see
him
or
his
mother
so
he
need
try
to
bring
her
in
say
to
robert
for
me
she
walked
from
the
house
head
erect
shoulders
squared
and
so
down
the
street
from
sight
in
half
an
hour
a
truckman
came
for
her
trunk
so
nancy
ellen
made
everything
kate
had
missed
into
a
bundle
to
send
with
it
when
she
came
to
the
letters
she
hesitated
i
guess
she
did
want
them
she
said
i
just
keep
them
awhile
and
if
she
does
ask
about
them
the
next
time
she
comes
i
burn
them
robert
must
go
after
her
every
friday
evening
and
we
keep
her
until
monday
and
do
all
we
can
to
cheer
her
and
this
very
day
he
must
find
out
all
there
is
to
know
about
that
george
holt
that
is
the
finest
letter
i
ever
read
she
does
kind
of
stand
up
for
him
and
in
the
reaction
impulsive
as
she
is
and
of
course
she
would
but
you
never
can
tell
what
kind
of
fool
a
girl
will
make
of
herself
in
some
cases
kate
walked
swiftly
finished
two
of
the
errands
she
set
out
to
do
then
her
feet
carried
her
three
miles
from
hartley
on
the
walden
road
before
she
knew
where
she
was
so
she
proceeded
to
the
village
holt
was
not
at
home
but
the
house
was
standing
open
kate
found
her
room
cleaned
shining
and
filled
with
flowers
she
paid
the
drayman
opened
her
trunk
and
put
away
her
dresses
laying
out
all
the
things
which
needed
washing
then
she
bathed
put
on
heavy
shoes
and
old
skirt
and
waist
and
crossing
the
road
sat
in
a
secluded
place
in
the
ravine
and
looked
stupidly
at
the
water
she
noticed
that
everything
was
as
she
had
left
it
in
the
spring
with
many
fresher
improvements
made
no
doubt
to
please
her
she
closed
her
eyes
leaned
against
a
big
tree
and
slow
cold
and
hot
shudders
alternated
in
shaking
her
frame
she
did
not
open
her
eyes
when
she
heard
a
step
and
her
name
called
she
knew
without
taking
the
trouble
to
look
that
george
had
come
home
found
her
luggage
in
her
room
and
was
hunting
for
her
she
heard
him
come
closer
and
knew
when
he
seated
himself
that
he
was
watching
her
but
she
did
not
care
enough
even
to
move
finally
she
shifted
her
position
to
rest
herself
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
without
a
word
he
returned
her
gaze
steadily
smiling
gravely
she
had
never
seen
him
looking
so
well
he
had
put
in
the
summer
grooming
himself
he
had
kept
up
the
house
and
garden
and
spent
all
his
spare
time
on
the
ravine
and
farming
on
the
shares
with
his
mother
sister
who
lived
three
miles
east
of
them
at
last
she
roused
herself
and
again
looked
at
him
i
had
your
letter
this
morning
she
said
i
was
wondering
about
that
he
replied
yes
i
got
it
just
before
i
started
said
kate
are
you
surprised
to
see
me
no
he
answered
after
last
year
we
figured
you
might
come
the
last
of
this
week
or
the
first
of
next
so
we
got
your
room
ready
monday
thank
you
said
kate
it
very
clean
and
nice
i
hope
soon
to
be
able
to
offer
you
such
a
room
and
home
as
you
should
have
he
said
i
have
opened
my
office
yet
it
was
late
and
hot
when
i
got
home
in
june
and
mother
was
fussing
about
this
winter
that
she
had
no
garden
and
did
do
her
share
at
aunt
ollie
so
i
have
farmed
most
of
the
summer
and
lived
on
hope
but
i
start
in
and
make
things
fly
this
fall
and
by
spring
i
be
sailing
around
with
a
horse
and
carriage
like
the
best
of
them
you
bet
i
am
going
to
make
things
hum
so
i
can
offer
you
anything
you
want
you
have
opened
an
office
yet
she
asked
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
and
because
a
practical
thing
would
naturally
suggest
itself
to
her
i
have
had
a
breath
of
time
he
said
in
candid
disclaimer
why
do
you
ask
me
what
the
matter
did
figure
that
it
was
any
of
my
business
in
the
first
place
he
said
and
i
have
a
pretty
fair
idea
in
the
second
but
how
could
you
have
she
asked
in
surprise
when
your
sister
would
give
me
your
address
she
hinted
that
you
had
all
the
masculine
attention
you
cared
for
then
tilly
nepple
visited
town
again
last
week
and
she
had
been
sick
and
called
gray
she
asked
him
about
you
and
he
told
what
i
fine
time
you
had
at
chautauqua
and
chicago
with
the
rich
new
friends
you
made
i
was
watching
for
you
about
this
time
and
i
just
happened
to
be
at
the
station
in
hartley
last
saturday
when
you
got
off
the
train
with
your
fine
gentleman
so
i
stayed
over
with
some
friends
of
mine
and
i
saw
you
several
times
sunday
i
saw
that
i
practically
no
chance
with
you
at
all
but
i
made
up
my
mind
i
stick
until
i
saw
you
marry
him
so
i
wrote
just
as
i
would
if
i
had
known
there
was
another
man
in
existence
that
was
a
very
fine
letter
said
kate
it
is
a
very
fine
deep
sincere
love
that
i
am
offering
you
said
george
holt
of
course
i
could
see
prosperity
sticking
out
all
over
that
city
chap
but
it
did
bother
me
much
because
i
knew
that
you
of
all
women
would
judge
a
man
on
his
worth
a
rising
young
professional
man
is
not
to
be
sneered
at
at
least
until
he
makes
his
start
and
proves
what
he
can
do
i
could
get
an
early
start
because
i
always
had
to
work
just
as
you
seen
me
last
summer
and
this
so
i
could
educate
myself
so
fast
but
i
gone
as
fast
and
far
as
i
could
kate
winced
this
was
getting
on
places
that
hurt
and
to
matters
she
well
understood
but
she
was
the
soul
of
candour
you
did
very
well
to
educate
yourself
as
you
have
with
no
help
at
all
she
said
i
done
my
best
in
the
past
i
going
to
do
marvels
in
the
future
and
whatever
i
do
it
is
all
for
you
and
yours
for
the
taking
he
said
grandiosely
thank
you
said
kate
but
are
you
making
that
offer
when
you
help
seeing
that
i
in
deep
trouble
a
thousand
times
over
he
said
all
i
want
to
know
about
your
trouble
is
whether
there
is
anything
a
man
of
my
size
and
strength
can
do
to
help
you
not
a
thing
said
kate
in
the
direction
of
slaying
a
gay
deceiver
if
that
what
you
mean
the
extent
of
my
familiarities
with
john
jardine
consists
in
voluntarily
kissing
him
twice
last
sunday
night
for
the
first
and
last
time
once
for
himself
and
once
for
his
mother
whom
i
have
since
ceased
to
respect
george
holt
was
watching
her
with
eyes
but
kate
never
saw
it
when
she
mentioned
her
farewell
of
sunday
night
a
queer
smile
swept
over
his
face
and
instantly
disappeared
i
should
thing
any
girl
might
be
permitted
that
much
in
saying
a
final
to
a
man
who
had
shown
her
a
fine
time
for
weeks
he
commented
casually
but
i
did
know
i
was
saying
explained
kate
i
expected
him
back
in
a
week
and
that
i
would
then
arrange
to
marry
him
that
was
the
agreement
we
made
then
as
she
began
to
speak
george
holt
face
flashed
triumph
at
having
led
her
on
at
what
she
said
it
fell
perceptibly
but
he
instantly
controlled
it
and
said
casually
in
any
event
it
was
your
own
business
it
was
said
kate
i
had
given
no
man
the
slightest
encouragement
i
was
perfectly
free
john
jardine
was
courting
me
openly
in
the
presence
of
his
mother
and
any
one
who
happened
to
be
around
i
intended
to
marry
him
i
liked
him
as
much
as
any
man
need
be
liked
i
do
know
whether
it
was
the
same
feeling
nancy
ellen
had
for
robert
gray
or
not
but
it
was
a
whole
lot
of
feeling
of
some
kind
i
was
satisfied
with
it
and
he
would
have
been
i
meant
to
be
a
good
wife
to
him
and
a
good
daughter
to
his
mother
and
i
could
have
done
much
good
in
the
world
and
extracted
untold
pleasure
from
the
money
he
would
have
put
in
my
power
to
handle
all
was
going
as
a
marriage
bell
and
then
this
morning
came
my
waterloo
in
the
same
post
with
your
letter
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
cried
george
holt
roughly
losing
with
hope
you
are
proving
to
me
and
admitting
to
yourself
that
you
never
loved
that
man
at
all
you
were
flattered
and
tempted
with
position
and
riches
but
your
heart
was
not
his
or
you
would
be
mighty
sure
of
it
do
you
forget
that
i
am
not
interested
in
analyzing
exactly
what
i
felt
for
him
said
kate
it
made
small
difference
then
it
makes
none
at
all
now
i
would
have
married
him
gladly
and
i
would
have
been
to
him
all
a
good
wife
is
to
any
man
then
in
a
few
seconds
i
turned
squarely
against
him
and
lost
my
respect
for
him
you
could
marry
me
to
him
if
he
were
the
last
and
only
man
on
earth
but
it
hurt
terribly
let
me
tell
you
that
george
holt
suddenly
arose
and
went
to
kate
he
sat
down
close
beside
her
and
leaned
toward
her
there
is
the
least
danger
of
my
trying
to
marry
you
to
him
he
said
because
i
am
going
to
marry
you
myself
at
the
very
first
opportunity
why
not
now
why
not
have
a
simple
ceremony
somewhere
at
once
and
go
away
until
school
begins
and
forget
him
having
a
good
time
by
ourselves
come
on
kate
let
do
it
we
can
go
stay
with
aunt
ollie
and
if
he
comes
trying
to
force
himself
on
you
he
get
what
he
deserves
he
learn
that
there
is
something
on
earth
he
ca
buy
with
his
money
but
i
do
love
you
said
kate
neither
did
you
love
him
retorted
george
holt
i
can
prove
it
by
what
you
say
neither
did
you
love
him
but
you
were
going
to
marry
him
and
use
all
his
wonderful
power
of
position
and
wealth
and
trust
to
association
to
bring
love
you
can
try
that
with
me
as
for
wealth
who
cares
we
are
young
and
strong
and
we
have
a
fine
chance
in
the
world
you
go
on
and
teach
this
year
and
i
get
such
a
start
that
by
next
year
you
can
be
riding
around
in
your
carriage
proud
as
pompey
of
course
we
could
make
it
all
right
as
to
a
living
said
kate
big
and
strong
as
we
are
but
then
the
torrent
broke
at
the
first
hint
that
she
would
consider
his
proposal
george
holt
drew
her
to
him
and
talked
volumes
of
impassioned
love
to
her
he
gave
her
no
chance
to
say
anything
he
said
all
there
was
to
say
himself
he
urged
that
jardine
would
come
and
she
should
not
be
there
he
begged
he
pleaded
he
reasoned
night
found
kate
sitting
on
the
back
porch
at
aunt
ollie
with
a
confused
memory
of
having
stood
beside
the
little
stream
with
her
hand
in
george
while
she
assented
to
the
questions
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
the
presence
of
the
school
director
and
holt
she
knew
that
immediately
thereafter
they
had
walked
away
along
a
hot
dusty
country
road
she
had
tried
to
eat
something
that
tasted
like
salted
ashes
she
could
hear
george
ringing
laugh
of
exultation
breaking
out
afresh
every
few
minutes
in
sudden
irritation
at
the
latest
guffaw
she
clearly
remembered
one
thing
in
her
dazed
and
bewildered
state
she
had
forgotten
to
tell
him
that
she
was
a
prodigal
daughter
chapter
xiii
the
bride
only
one
memory
in
the
ten
days
that
followed
before
her
school
began
ever
stood
out
clearly
and
distinctly
with
kate
that
was
the
morning
of
the
day
after
she
married
george
holt
she
saw
nancy
ellen
and
robert
at
the
gate
so
she
went
out
to
speak
with
them
nancy
ellen
was
driving
she
held
the
lines
and
the
whip
in
her
hands
kate
in
dull
apathy
wondered
why
they
seemed
so
deeply
agitated
both
of
them
stared
at
her
as
if
she
might
be
a
maniac
is
this
thing
in
the
morning
paper
true
cried
nancy
ellen
in
a
high
shrill
voice
that
made
kate
start
in
wonder
she
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
evade
by
asking
what
thing
she
merely
made
assent
with
her
head
you
are
married
to
that
that
nancy
ellen
choked
until
she
could
not
say
what
it
time
to
stop
since
i
am
married
to
him
said
kate
gravely
you
rushed
in
and
married
him
without
giving
robert
time
to
find
out
and
tell
you
what
everybody
knows
about
him
demanded
nancy
ellen
i
married
him
for
what
i
knew
about
him
myself
said
kate
we
shall
do
very
well
do
well
cried
nancy
do
well
you
be
hungry
and
in
rags
the
rest
of
your
life
do
nancy
ellen
do
plead
robert
this
is
kate
affair
wait
until
you
hear
what
she
has
to
say
before
you
go
further
i
do
care
what
she
has
to
say
cried
nancy
ellen
i
saying
my
say
right
now
this
is
a
disgrace
to
the
whole
bates
family
we
may
not
be
much
but
there
is
a
lazy
gambling
drunken
loafer
among
us
and
there
wo
be
so
far
as
i
concerned
she
glared
at
kate
who
gazed
at
her
in
wonder
you
really
married
this
lout
she
demanded
i
told
you
i
was
married
said
kate
patiently
for
she
saw
that
nancy
ellen
was
irresponsible
with
anger
you
going
to
live
with
him
you
going
to
stay
in
walden
to
live
she
cried
that
is
my
plan
at
present
said
kate
well
see
that
you
stay
there
said
nancy
ellen
you
ca
bring
that
that
creature
to
my
house
and
if
you
going
to
be
his
wife
you
need
come
yourself
that
all
i
got
to
say
to
you
you
shameless
crazy
nancy
ellen
you
shall
not
cried
robert
gray
deftly
slipping
the
lines
from
her
fingers
and
starting
the
horse
full
speed
kate
saw
nancy
ellen
head
fall
forward
and
her
hands
lifted
to
cover
her
face
she
heard
the
deep
tearing
sob
that
shook
her
and
then
they
were
gone
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
so
she
stood
still
in
the
hot
sunshine
trying
to
think
but
her
brain
refused
to
act
at
her
will
when
the
heat
became
oppressive
she
turned
back
to
the
shade
of
a
tree
sat
down
and
leaned
against
it
there
she
got
two
things
clear
after
a
time
she
had
married
george
holt
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
make
the
best
of
it
but
nancy
ellen
had
said
that
if
she
lived
with
him
she
should
not
come
to
her
home
very
well
she
had
to
live
with
him
since
she
had
consented
to
marry
him
so
she
was
cut
off
from
robert
and
nancy
ellen
she
was
now
a
prodigal
indeed
and
those
things
nancy
ellen
had
said
she
was
wild
with
anger
she
had
been
misinformed
those
things
could
not
be
true
should
you
be
in
here
helping
aunt
ollie
asked
george
voice
from
the
front
step
where
he
seated
himself
with
his
pipe
yes
in
a
minute
said
kate
rising
did
you
see
who
came
no
i
was
out
doing
the
morning
work
who
was
it
he
asked
nancy
ellen
and
robert
she
answered
he
laughed
hilariously
brought
them
in
a
hurry
did
we
why
did
they
come
in
they
came
to
tell
me
said
kate
slowly
that
if
i
had
married
you
yesterday
as
i
did
that
they
felt
so
disgraced
that
i
was
to
come
to
their
home
again
he
cried
his
colour
rising
well
what
the
matter
with
me
not
the
things
they
said
i
fervently
hope
well
they
have
some
assurance
to
come
out
here
and
talk
about
me
and
you
got
as
much
to
listen
and
then
come
and
tell
me
about
it
he
cried
it
was
over
in
a
minute
said
kate
i
no
idea
what
they
were
going
to
say
they
said
it
and
went
oh
i
ca
spare
nancy
ellen
she
all
i
had
kate
sank
down
on
the
step
and
covered
her
face
george
took
one
long
look
at
her
arose
and
walked
out
of
hearing
he
went
into
the
garden
and
watched
from
behind
a
honeysuckle
bush
until
he
saw
her
finally
lift
her
head
and
wipe
her
eyes
then
he
sauntered
back
and
sat
down
on
the
step
beside
her
that
right
he
said
cry
it
out
and
get
it
over
it
was
pretty
mean
of
them
to
come
out
here
and
insult
you
and
tell
any
lie
they
could
think
up
and
then
drive
away
and
leave
you
but
do
mind
they
soon
get
over
it
nobody
ever
keeps
up
a
fuss
over
a
wedding
long
nancy
ellen
never
told
a
lie
in
her
life
said
kate
she
has
too
much
what
she
said
she
thought
was
true
my
only
chance
is
that
somebody
has
told
her
a
lie
you
know
best
if
they
did
of
course
they
did
he
broke
in
glibly
have
you
lived
in
the
same
house
with
me
long
enough
to
know
me
better
than
any
one
else
does
you
can
live
in
the
same
house
with
people
and
know
less
about
them
than
any
one
else
for
that
matter
said
kate
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
we
in
this
together
we
got
to
get
on
the
job
and
pull
and
make
a
success
out
of
it
that
will
make
all
of
them
proud
to
be
our
friends
that
the
only
thing
left
for
me
as
i
know
the
bates
once
they
make
up
their
minds
they
never
change
with
nancy
ellen
and
father
both
down
on
me
i
a
prodigal
for
sure
what
he
cried
loudly
what
is
your
father
in
this
too
did
he
send
you
word
you
could
come
home
either
this
is
a
hell
of
a
mess
speak
up
kate
closed
her
lips
looked
at
him
with
deep
scorn
and
walked
around
the
corner
of
the
house
for
a
second
he
looked
after
her
threateningly
then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
ran
to
her
catching
her
in
his
arms
forgive
me
dearest
he
cried
that
took
the
wind
out
of
my
sails
until
i
was
a
brute
you
no
business
to
say
a
thing
like
that
of
course
we
ca
have
the
old
land
king
down
on
us
we
got
to
have
our
share
of
that
land
and
money
to
buy
us
a
fine
home
in
hartley
and
fix
me
up
the
kind
of
an
office
i
should
have
we
borrow
a
rig
and
drive
over
and
fix
things
solid
with
the
old
folks
you
bet
i
a
old
persuader
look
what
i
did
with
you
you
stop
cried
kate
breaking
from
his
hold
you
will
drive
me
crazy
you
talking
as
if
you
married
me
expecting
land
and
money
from
it
i
have
been
home
in
a
year
and
my
father
would
deliberately
kill
me
if
i
went
within
his
reach
well
score
one
for
little
old
scratchin
pickin
mammy
he
cried
she
said
you
had
a
secret
kate
stood
very
still
looking
at
him
so
intently
that
a
sense
of
shame
must
have
stirred
in
his
breast
look
here
kate
he
said
roughly
mother
did
say
you
had
a
secret
and
she
hinted
at
christmas
that
the
reason
you
did
go
home
was
because
your
folks
were
at
outs
with
you
and
you
can
ask
her
if
i
did
tell
her
to
shut
up
and
leave
you
alone
that
i
was
in
love
with
you
and
i
marry
you
and
we
get
along
all
right
even
if
you
were
barred
from
home
and
did
get
a
penny
i
just
dare
you
to
ask
her
it
no
matter
said
kate
wearily
i
rather
take
your
word
all
right
you
take
it
for
that
the
truth
he
said
but
what
was
the
rumpus
how
did
you
come
to
have
a
racket
with
your
old
man
over
my
wanting
to
teach
said
kate
then
she
explained
in
detail
pother
do
you
fret
about
that
said
george
i
taking
care
of
you
now
and
i
see
that
you
soon
get
home
and
to
grays
too
all
buncombe
as
for
your
share
of
your
father
estate
you
watch
me
get
it
you
are
his
child
and
there
is
law
there
law
that
allows
him
to
deed
his
land
to
his
sons
before
he
dies
and
that
is
exactly
what
he
has
done
said
kate
the
devil
you
say
shouted
george
holt
stepping
back
to
stare
at
her
you
tell
that
at
the
insane
asylum
or
the
feeble
minded
home
i
seen
the
records
i
know
to
the
acre
how
much
land
stands
in
your
father
name
do
try
to
work
that
on
me
my
lady
i
am
not
trying
to
work
anything
on
you
said
kate
dully
wondering
to
herself
why
she
listened
why
she
went
on
with
it
i
merely
telling
you
in
father
big
chest
at
the
head
of
his
bed
at
home
lies
a
deed
for
two
hundred
acres
of
land
for
each
of
his
seven
sons
all
signed
and
ready
to
deliver
he
keeps
the
land
in
his
name
on
record
to
bring
him
distinction
and
feed
his
vanity
he
makes
the
boys
pay
the
taxes
and
and
help
with
his
work
he
keeps
them
under
control
but
the
land
is
theirs
none
of
the
girls
get
a
penny
worth
of
it
george
holt
cleared
his
face
with
an
effort
well
we
are
no
worse
off
than
the
rest
of
them
then
he
said
trying
to
speak
naturally
and
cheerfully
but
do
you
ever
believe
it
little
old
georgie
will
sleep
with
this
in
his
night
cap
awhile
and
it
a
problem
he
will
solve
if
he
works
himself
to
death
on
it
but
that
is
father
affair
said
kate
you
had
best
turn
your
efforts
and
lie
awake
nights
thinking
how
to
make
enough
money
to
buy
some
land
for
us
yourself
certainly
certainly
i
see
myself
doing
it
laughed
george
holt
and
now
knowing
how
you
feel
and
feeling
none
to
good
myself
we
are
going
to
take
a
few
days
off
and
go
upstream
fishing
i
take
a
pack
of
comforts
to
sleep
on
and
the
tackle
and
some
food
and
we
will
forget
the
whole
bunch
and
go
have
a
good
time
there
a
place
not
so
far
away
where
i
have
camped
beside
a
spring
since
i
was
a
little
shaver
and
it
quiet
and
cool
go
get
what
you
ca
possibly
exist
without
nothing
more
but
we
must
dig
the
potatoes
protested
kate
let
them
wait
until
we
get
back
it
a
trifle
early
anyway
he
said
stop
objecting
and
get
ready
i
tell
aunt
ollie
chums
whatever
i
do
is
always
all
right
with
her
come
on
this
is
our
wedding
trip
not
much
like
the
one
you
had
planned
no
doubt
but
one
of
some
kind
so
they
slipped
beneath
the
tangle
of
vines
and
bushes
and
following
the
stream
of
the
ravine
they
walked
until
when
they
reached
a
spot
that
was
very
lovely
a
clear
clean
spring
grassy
bank
a
sheltered
floored
with
clean
sand
warm
and
golden
from
the
depths
of
the
cave
george
brought
an
old
frying
pan
and
coffee
pot
he
spread
a
comfort
on
the
sand
of
the
cave
for
a
bed
produced
coffee
steak
bread
butter
and
fruit
from
his
load
and
told
kate
to
make
herself
comfortable
while
he
got
dinner
they
each
tried
to
make
allowances
for
and
to
be
as
decent
as
possible
with
the
other
with
the
result
that
before
they
knew
it
they
were
having
a
good
time
at
least
they
were
keeping
the
irritating
things
they
thought
to
themselves
and
saying
only
the
pleasant
ones
after
a
week
which
george
enjoyed
to
the
fullest
extent
while
kate
made
the
best
of
everything
they
put
away
the
coffee
pot
and
frying
pan
folded
the
comforts
and
went
back
to
aunt
ollie
for
dinner
then
to
walden
in
the
afternoon
because
holt
knew
they
would
be
there
that
day
she
had
the
house
clean
and
the
best
supper
she
could
prepare
ready
for
them
she
was
in
a
quandary
as
to
how
to
begin
with
kate
she
heartily
hated
her
she
had
been
sure
the
girl
had
a
secret
now
she
knew
it
for
if
she
did
not
attend
the
wedding
of
her
sister
if
she
had
not
been
at
home
all
summer
if
her
father
and
mother
never
mentioned
her
name
or
made
any
answer
to
any
one
who
did
there
was
a
reason
and
a
good
reason
of
course
a
man
as
rich
as
adam
bates
could
do
no
wrong
whatever
the
trouble
was
kate
was
at
fault
she
had
done
some
terrible
thing
hidin
in
the
bushes
spat
holt
hidin
in
the
bushes
marry
a
man
who
did
know
he
was
goin
to
be
married
an
hour
before
unbeknownst
to
her
folks
an
would
even
come
in
the
house
an
have
a
few
of
the
neighbours
in
nice
doin
for
the
nice
prospect
for
george
holt
hissed
like
a
copperhead
which
was
a
harmless
little
creature
compared
with
her
as
she
scraped
and
slashed
and
dismembered
the
chicken
she
was
preparing
to
fry
she
had
not
been
able
even
by
running
into
each
store
in
the
village
and
the
post
office
to
find
one
person
who
would
say
a
word
against
kate
the
girl
had
laid
her
foundations
too
well
the
one
thing
people
could
and
did
say
was
how
could
she
marry
george
holt
the
worst
of
them
could
not
very
well
say
it
to
his
mother
they
said
it
frequently
to
each
other
and
then
supplied
the
true
answers
look
how
he
spruced
up
after
she
came
look
how
he
worked
look
how
he
ran
after
and
waited
on
her
look
how
nice
he
has
been
all
summer
plenty
was
being
said
in
walden
but
not
one
word
of
it
was
for
the
itching
ears
of
holt
they
had
told
her
how
splendid
kate
was
how
they
loved
her
how
glad
they
were
that
she
was
to
have
the
school
again
how
fortunate
her
son
was
how
proud
she
should
be
until
she
was
almost
bursting
with
repressed
venom
she
met
them
at
the
gate
after
their
week
camping
they
were
feeling
in
splendid
health
the
best
spirits
possible
in
the
circumstances
but
appearing
dirty
and
disreputable
they
were
both
laughing
as
they
approached
the
gate
purty
lookin
bride
you
be
holt
spat
at
kate
yes
are
i
laughed
kate
but
you
just
give
me
a
tub
of
hot
soapsuds
and
an
hour
and
you
wo
know
me
how
are
you
things
look
as
if
you
were
expecting
us
hump
said
holt
kate
laughed
and
went
into
the
house
george
stepped
in
front
of
his
mother
now
you
look
here
he
said
i
know
every
nasty
thing
your
mind
has
conjured
up
that
you
like
to
say
and
have
other
folks
say
about
kate
and
i
know
as
well
as
if
you
were
honest
enough
to
tell
me
that
you
have
been
able
to
root
out
one
living
soul
who
would
say
a
single
word
against
her
swallow
your
secret
swallow
your
suspicions
swallow
your
venom
and
forget
all
of
them
kate
is
as
fine
a
woman
as
god
ever
made
and
anybody
who
has
common
sense
knows
it
she
can
just
make
me
if
she
wants
to
and
she
will
she
coming
on
fine
much
faster
and
better
than
i
hoped
for
now
you
drop
this
stop
it
do
you
hear
he
passed
her
and
hurried
up
the
walk
in
an
hour
both
george
and
kate
had
bathed
and
dressed
in
their
very
best
kate
put
on
her
prettiest
white
dress
and
george
his
graduation
suit
then
together
they
walked
to
the
post
office
for
their
mail
which
george
had
ordered
held
before
they
left
carrying
the
bundle
they
entered
several
stores
on
trifling
errands
and
then
went
home
they
stopped
and
spoke
to
everyone
kate
kissed
all
her
little
pupils
she
met
and
told
them
to
come
to
see
her
and
to
be
ready
to
help
clean
the
schoolhouse
in
the
morning
word
flew
over
town
swiftly
the
teacher
was
back
wearing
the
loveliest
dress
and
nicer
than
ever
and
she
had
invited
folks
to
come
to
see
her
kate
and
george
had
scarcely
finished
their
supper
when
the
first
pair
of
shy
little
girls
came
for
their
kisses
and
to
bring
teacher
a
bunch
of
flowers
and
a
pretty
pocket
handkerchief
from
each
they
came
in
flocks
each
with
flowers
most
with
a
towel
or
some
small
remembrance
then
the
elders
began
to
come
merchants
with
comforts
blankets
and
towels
hardware
men
with
frying
pans
flat
irons
and
tinware
by
ten
almost
everyone
in
walden
had
carried
kate
some
small
gift
wished
her
joy
all
the
more
earnestly
because
they
felt
the
chances
of
her
ever
having
it
were
so
small
and
had
gone
their
way
leaving
her
feeling
better
than
she
had
thought
possible
she
slipped
into
her
room
alone
and
read
two
letters
one
a
few
typewritten
lines
from
john
jardine
saying
he
had
been
at
hartley
also
at
walden
and
having
found
her
married
and
gone
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
wish
that
the
man
she
married
had
it
in
his
heart
to
guard
her
life
and
happiness
as
he
would
have
done
he
would
never
cease
to
love
her
and
if
at
any
time
in
her
life
there
was
anything
he
could
do
for
her
would
she
please
let
him
know
kate
dropped
the
letter
on
her
dresser
with
a
purpose
and
let
it
lie
there
the
other
was
from
robert
he
said
he
was
very
sorry
but
he
could
do
nothing
with
nancy
ellen
at
present
he
hoped
she
would
change
later
if
there
was
ever
anything
he
could
do
to
let
him
know
kate
locked
that
letter
in
her
trunk
she
wondered
as
she
did
so
why
both
of
them
seemed
to
think
she
would
need
them
in
the
future
she
felt
perfectly
able
to
take
care
of
herself
monday
morning
george
carried
kate
books
to
school
for
her
saw
that
she
was
started
on
her
work
in
good
shape
then
went
home
put
on
his
old
clothes
and
began
the
fall
work
at
aunt
ollie
kate
wearing
her
prettiest
blue
dress
forgot
even
the
dull
ache
in
her
heart
as
she
threw
herself
into
the
business
of
educating
those
young
people
she
worked
as
she
never
had
before
she
seemed
to
have
developed
fresh
patience
new
perception
keener
penetration
she
made
the
dullest
of
them
see
her
points
and
interested
the
most
inattentive
she
went
home
to
dinner
feeling
better
she
decided
to
keep
on
teaching
a
few
years
until
george
was
well
started
in
his
practice
if
he
ever
got
started
he
was
very
slow
in
action
it
seemed
to
her
compared
with
his
enthusiasm
when
he
talked
chapter
xiv
starting
married
life
for
two
weeks
kate
threw
herself
into
the
business
of
teaching
with
all
her
power
she
succeeded
in
so
interesting
herself
and
her
pupils
that
she
was
convinced
she
had
done
a
wise
thing
marriage
did
not
interfere
with
her
teaching
she
felt
capable
and
independent
so
long
as
she
had
her
salary
george
was
working
and
working
diligently
to
prepare
for
winter
whenever
she
was
present
or
could
see
results
with
her
first
month
salary
she
would
buy
herself
a
warm
coat
a
wool
suit
an
extra
skirt
for
school
and
some
waists
if
there
was
enough
left
she
would
have
another
real
hat
then
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
she
would
spend
only
for
the
barest
necessities
and
save
to
help
toward
a
home
something
like
nancy
ellen
whenever
she
thought
of
nancy
ellen
and
robert
there
was
a
choking
sensation
in
her
throat
a
dull
ache
where
she
had
been
taught
her
heart
was
located
for
two
weeks
everything
went
as
well
as
kate
hoped
then
holt
began
to
show
the
results
of
having
been
partially
bottled
up
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
careful
to
keep
to
generalities
which
she
could
claim
meant
nothing
if
anything
she
said
was
taken
up
by
either
george
or
kate
george
was
too
lazy
to
quarrel
unless
he
was
personally
angered
kate
thought
best
to
ignore
anything
that
did
not
come
in
the
nature
of
a
direct
attack
so
long
as
holt
could
not
understand
how
some
folks
could
see
their
way
to
live
off
of
other
folks
or
why
a
girl
who
had
a
chance
to
marry
a
fortune
would
make
herself
a
burden
to
a
poor
man
kate
made
the
mistake
of
ignoring
her
thus
emboldened
she
soon
became
personal
it
seemed
as
if
she
spent
her
spare
time
and
mental
force
thinking
up
suggestive
sarcastic
things
to
say
where
kate
could
not
help
hearing
them
she
paid
no
attention
unless
the
attack
was
too
mean
and
premeditated
but
to
her
surprise
she
found
that
every
ugly
malicious
word
the
old
woman
said
lodged
in
her
brain
and
arose
to
confront
her
at
the
most
inopportune
times
in
the
middle
of
a
recitation
or
when
she
roused
enough
to
turn
over
in
her
bed
at
night
the
more
vigorously
she
threw
herself
into
her
school
work
the
more
she
realized
a
queer
lassitude
creeping
over
her
she
kept
squaring
her
shoulders
lifting
her
chin
and
brushing
imaginary
cobwebs
from
before
her
face
the
final
friday
evening
of
the
month
she
stopped
at
the
post
office
and
carried
away
with
her
the
bill
for
her
leghorn
hat
mailed
with
nicely
conceived
estimate
as
to
when
her
first
check
would
be
due
kate
visited
the
trustee
and
smiled
grimly
as
she
slipped
the
amount
in
an
envelope
and
gave
it
to
the
hack
driver
to
carry
to
hartley
on
his
trip
the
following
day
she
had
intended
all
fall
to
go
with
him
and
select
a
winter
headpiece
that
would
be
no
discredit
to
her
summer
choice
but
a
sort
of
numbness
was
in
her
bones
so
she
decided
to
wait
until
the
coming
week
before
going
she
declined
george
pressing
invitation
to
go
along
to
aunt
ollie
and
help
load
and
bring
home
a
part
of
his
share
of
their
summer
crops
on
the
ground
that
she
had
some
work
to
prepare
for
the
coming
week
then
kate
went
to
her
room
feeling
faint
and
heavy
she
lay
there
most
of
the
day
becoming
sorrier
for
herself
and
heavier
every
passing
hour
by
morning
she
was
violently
ill
when
she
tried
to
leave
her
bed
dizzy
and
faint
all
day
she
could
not
stand
toward
evening
she
appealed
to
george
either
to
do
something
for
her
himself
or
to
send
for
the
village
doctor
he
asked
her
a
few
questions
and
then
laughing
coarsely
told
her
that
a
doctor
would
do
her
no
good
and
that
it
was
very
probable
that
she
would
feel
far
worse
before
she
felt
better
kate
stared
at
him
in
dumb
wonder
but
my
school
she
cried
my
school
i
must
be
able
to
go
to
school
in
the
morning
could
that
spring
water
have
been
infected
with
typhus
i
never
been
sick
like
this
before
i
should
hope
not
said
george
and
then
he
told
her
bluntly
what
caused
her
trouble
kate
had
been
white
to
begin
with
now
she
slowly
turned
greenish
as
she
gazed
at
him
with
incredulous
eyes
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
but
i
ca
be
ill
she
cried
i
ca
there
is
my
school
got
to
teach
oh
what
shall
i
do
george
had
a
very
clear
conception
of
what
she
could
do
but
he
did
not
intend
to
suggest
it
to
her
she
could
think
of
it
and
propose
it
herself
she
could
not
think
of
anything
at
that
minute
because
she
fainted
and
fell
half
on
the
bed
half
in
his
arms
as
he
sprang
to
her
he
laid
her
down
and
stood
a
second
smiling
triumphantly
at
her
unheeding
face
easy
snap
for
you
this
winter
georgie
my
boy
he
muttered
i
do
see
people
falling
over
each
other
to
get
to
you
for
professional
services
and
it
hard
work
anyway
zonoletics
are
away
above
the
head
of
these
country
ignoramuses
blue
mass
and
quinine
are
about
their
limit
he
took
his
time
to
bathe
kate
face
presently
she
sat
up
then
fell
on
the
pillow
again
better
not
try
that
warned
george
you
hurt
yourself
and
you
ca
make
it
you
out
of
the
game
you
might
as
well
get
used
to
it
i
wo
be
out
of
the
game
cried
kate
i
ca
be
what
will
become
of
my
school
oh
george
could
you
possibly
teach
for
me
only
for
a
few
days
until
i
get
my
stomach
settled
why
i
like
to
help
you
he
said
but
you
see
how
it
is
with
me
i
got
my
fall
work
finished
up
and
i
getting
ready
to
open
my
office
next
week
i
going
to
rent
that
nice
front
room
over
the
post
office
but
george
you
must
said
kate
you
taught
several
terms
you
a
license
you
can
take
it
until
this
passes
if
you
have
waited
from
june
to
october
to
open
your
office
you
can
wait
a
few
more
days
suppose
you
open
the
office
and
patients
do
come
or
we
have
the
school
what
would
we
live
on
what
would
i
buy
things
with
and
pay
doctor
bills
why
did
you
think
of
that
before
you
got
married
what
was
your
rush
anyway
i
ca
figure
it
to
save
my
soul
he
said
george
the
school
ca
go
she
cried
if
what
you
say
is
true
and
i
suspect
it
is
i
must
have
money
to
see
me
through
then
set
your
wits
to
work
and
fix
things
up
with
your
father
he
said
casually
kate
arose
tall
and
straight
standing
unwaveringly
as
she
looked
at
him
in
blazing
contempt
so
she
said
this
is
the
kind
of
man
you
are
i
not
so
helpless
as
you
think
me
i
have
a
refuge
i
know
where
to
find
it
teach
my
school
until
i
able
to
take
it
myself
if
the
trustee
and
patrons
will
allow
you
or
i
sever
my
relations
with
you
as
quickly
as
i
formed
them
you
have
no
practice
i
have
grave
doubts
if
you
can
get
any
this
is
our
only
chance
for
the
money
we
must
have
this
winter
go
ask
the
trustee
to
come
here
until
i
can
make
arrangements
with
him
then
she
wavered
and
rolled
on
the
bed
again
george
stood
looking
at
her
between
narrowed
eyelids
tactics
i
use
with
mother
do
go
with
you
old
girl
he
said
to
himself
thing
of
fire
and
tow
stubborn
as
an
ox
wo
be
pushed
a
hair
breadth
old
bates
over
again
alike
as
two
peas
but
break
you
damn
you
i
break
you
only
i
want
that
school
lots
easier
than
kneading
somebody
old
stiff
muscles
while
the
money
is
sure
oh
i
go
after
the
trustee
all
right
he
revived
kate
and
telling
her
to
keep
quiet
and
not
excite
herself
he
explained
that
it
was
a
terrible
sacrifice
to
him
to
put
off
opening
his
office
any
longer
she
must
forgive
him
for
losing
when
he
thought
of
it
but
for
her
dear
sake
he
would
teach
until
she
was
better
possibly
she
would
be
all
right
in
a
few
days
and
then
she
could
take
her
work
again
because
she
so
devoutly
hoped
it
kate
made
that
arrangement
with
the
trustee
monday
she
lay
half
starved
yet
gagging
and
ill
while
george
went
to
teach
her
school
as
she
contemplated
that
she
grew
sicker
than
she
had
been
before
when
she
suddenly
marshalled
all
the
facts
she
knew
of
him
she
stoutly
refused
to
think
of
what
nancy
ellen
had
said
when
she
reviewed
his
character
and
disposition
and
thought
of
him
taking
charge
of
the
minds
of
her
pupils
kate
suddenly
felt
she
must
not
allow
that
to
happen
she
must
not
then
came
another
thought
even
more
personal
and
terrible
a
thought
so
disconcerting
she
mercifully
lost
consciousness
again
she
sent
for
the
village
doctor
and
found
no
consolation
from
her
talk
with
him
she
was
out
of
the
school
that
was
settled
no
harpy
ever
went
to
its
meat
with
one
half
the
zest
holt
found
in
the
situation
with
kate
so
ill
she
could
not
stand
on
her
feet
half
the
time
so
ill
she
could
not
reply
with
no
spirit
left
to
appeal
to
george
what
more
could
be
asked
holt
could
add
to
every
grievance
she
formerly
had
that
of
a
sick
woman
in
the
house
for
her
to
wait
on
she
could
even
make
vile
insinuations
to
kate
prostrate
and
helpless
that
she
would
not
have
dared
otherwise
she
could
prepare
food
that
with
a
touch
of
salt
or
sugar
where
it
was
not
supposed
to
be
would
have
sickened
a
well
person
one
day
george
came
in
from
school
and
saw
a
bowl
of
broth
sitting
on
a
chair
beside
bed
ca
you
drink
it
he
asked
do
if
you
possibly
can
he
urged
you
get
so
weak
you
be
helpless
i
just
ca
said
kate
things
have
such
a
sickening
sweetish
taste
or
they
are
bitter
or
sour
not
a
thing
is
as
it
used
to
be
i
simply
ca
a
curious
look
crept
over
george
face
he
picked
up
the
bowl
and
tasted
the
contents
instantly
his
face
went
black
he
started
toward
the
kitchen
kate
heard
part
of
what
happened
but
she
never
lifted
her
head
after
a
while
he
came
back
with
more
broth
and
a
plate
of
delicate
toast
try
this
he
said
i
made
it
myself
kate
ate
ravenously
that
good
she
cried
i
tell
you
what
i
going
to
do
he
said
i
going
to
take
you
out
to
aunt
ollie
for
a
week
after
school
want
to
go
yes
oh
yes
cried
kate
all
right
he
said
i
know
where
i
can
borrow
a
rig
for
an
hour
get
ready
if
you
are
well
enough
if
you
are
not
i
help
you
after
school
that
week
with
aunt
ollie
remained
a
bright
spot
in
kate
memory
the
october
days
were
beginning
to
be
crisp
and
cool
food
was
different
she
could
sleep
she
could
eat
many
things
aunt
ollie
knew
to
prepare
especially
soon
she
could
walk
and
be
outdoors
she
was
so
much
better
she
wrote
george
a
note
asking
him
to
walk
out
and
bring
her
sewing
basket
and
some
goods
she
listed
and
in
the
afternoons
the
two
women
cut
and
sewed
quaint
enticing
little
garments
george
found
kate
so
much
better
when
he
came
that
he
proposed
she
remain
another
week
then
for
the
first
time
he
talked
to
her
about
her
theory
of
government
and
teaching
until
she
realized
that
the
school
director
had
told
him
he
was
dissatisfied
with
him
so
george
was
trying
to
learn
her
ways
appalled
at
what
might
happen
if
he
lost
the
school
kate
made
notes
talked
at
length
begged
him
to
do
his
best
and
to
come
at
once
if
anything
went
wrong
he
did
come
and
brought
the
school
books
so
she
went
over
the
lessons
with
him
and
made
marginal
notes
of
things
suggested
to
her
mind
by
the
text
for
him
to
discuss
and
elucidate
the
next
time
he
came
he
was
in
such
good
spirits
she
knew
his
work
had
been
praised
so
after
that
they
went
over
the
lessons
together
each
evening
thinking
of
what
would
help
him
also
helped
fill
her
day
he
took
her
home
greatly
improved
in
much
better
spirits
to
her
room
cleaned
and
ready
for
winter
with
all
of
her
things
possible
to
use
in
place
so
that
it
was
much
changed
prettier
and
more
convenient
as
they
drove
in
she
said
of
him
george
what
about
it
did
your
mother
purposely
fix
my
food
so
i
could
not
eat
it
oh
i
would
say
that
he
said
you
know
neither
of
you
is
violently
attached
to
the
other
she
be
more
careful
after
this
i
sure
she
will
why
have
you
been
sick
asked
kate
as
soon
as
she
saw
holt
she
seemed
so
nervous
and
appeared
so
badly
kate
was
sorry
for
her
but
she
could
not
help
noticing
how
she
kept
watch
on
her
son
she
seemed
to
keep
the
width
of
the
room
and
a
piece
of
furniture
between
them
while
her
cooking
was
so
different
that
it
was
not
in
the
least
necessary
for
george
to
fix
things
for
kate
himself
as
he
had
suggested
everything
was
so
improved
kate
felt
better
she
began
to
sew
to
read
to
sit
for
long
periods
in
profound
thought
then
to
take
walks
that
brought
back
her
strength
and
colour
so
through
the
winter
and
toward
the
approach
of
spring
they
lived
in
greater
comfort
with
kate
help
george
was
doing
so
well
with
the
school
that
he
was
frequently
complimented
by
the
parents
that
he
was
trying
to
do
good
work
and
win
the
approval
of
both
pupils
and
parents
was
evident
to
kate
once
he
said
to
her
that
he
wondered
if
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
him
to
put
in
an
application
for
the
school
the
coming
winter
kate
stared
at
him
in
surprise
but
your
profession
she
objected
you
should
be
in
your
office
and
having
enough
practice
to
support
us
by
then
yes
i
should
he
said
but
this
is
a
new
thing
and
you
know
how
these
clodhoppers
are
if
i
came
as
near
living
in
the
country
and
worked
at
farming
as
much
as
you
do
that
the
last
thing
i
would
call
any
human
being
said
kate
i
certainly
do
know
how
they
are
and
what
i
know
convinces
me
that
you
need
not
look
to
them
for
any
patients
you
seem
to
think
i
wo
have
any
from
any
source
he
said
hotly
i
confess
myself
dubious
said
kate
you
certainly
are
or
you
would
be
talking
of
teaching
well
i
just
show
you
he
cried
i
waiting
said
kate
but
as
we
must
live
in
the
meantime
and
it
will
be
so
long
before
i
can
earn
anything
again
and
so
much
expense
possibly
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
have
the
school
to
fall
back
on
if
you
should
have
the
patients
you
hope
for
this
summer
i
think
you
have
done
well
with
the
school
do
your
level
best
until
the
term
closes
and
you
may
have
a
chance
laughing
scornfully
he
repeated
his
old
boast
i
just
show
you
go
ahead
said
kate
and
while
you
are
at
it
be
generous
show
me
plenty
but
in
the
meantime
save
every
penny
you
can
so
you
be
ready
to
pay
the
doctor
bills
and
furnish
your
office
i
love
you
advice
it
so
batesy
he
said
i
have
money
saved
for
both
contingencies
you
mention
but
i
tell
you
what
i
think
and
about
this
i
the
one
who
knows
i
told
you
repeatedly
winter
is
my
best
time
i
lost
the
winter
trying
to
help
you
out
and
little
chance
until
winter
comes
again
it
takes
cold
weather
to
make
folks
feel
what
ails
their
muscles
and
my
treatment
is
mostly
muscular
to
save
so
we
can
get
a
real
start
would
it
be
a
good
idea
for
you
to
put
part
of
your
things
in
my
room
take
what
you
must
have
and
fix
mother
bedroom
for
you
let
her
move
her
bed
into
her
living
room
and
spare
me
all
you
can
of
your
things
to
fix
up
your
room
for
my
office
this
summer
that
would
save
rent
it
only
a
few
steps
from
downtown
and
when
i
was
busy
with
patients
i
could
be
handy
to
the
garden
and
to
help
you
if
your
mother
is
willing
i
do
my
share
said
kate
although
the
room
cramped
and
where
i
put
the
small
party
when
he
comes
i
do
know
but
i
manage
someway
the
big
objection
to
it
is
that
it
will
make
it
look
to
people
as
if
it
were
a
makeshift
instead
of
starting
a
real
business
real
was
the
wrong
word
it
was
the
red
rag
that
started
george
raging
until
to
save
her
kate
left
the
room
later
in
the
day
he
announced
that
his
mother
was
willing
she
would
clean
the
living
room
and
move
in
that
day
how
kate
hated
the
tiny
room
with
its
one
exterior
wall
only
one
small
window
its
scratched
woodwork
and
soiled
paper
she
could
not
say
she
felt
physically
ill
when
she
thought
of
it
and
when
she
thought
of
the
heat
of
the
coming
summer
she
wondered
what
she
would
do
but
all
she
could
do
was
to
acquiesce
she
made
a
trip
downtown
and
bought
a
quart
of
white
paint
and
a
few
rolls
of
dainty
fresh
paper
she
made
herself
ill
with
turpentine
odours
in
giving
the
woodwork
three
coats
and
fell
from
a
table
almost
killing
herself
while
papering
the
ceiling
there
was
no
room
for
her
trunk
the
closet
would
not
hold
half
her
clothes
her
only
easy
chair
was
crowded
out
she
was
sheared
of
personal
comfort
at
a
clip
just
at
a
time
when
every
comfort
should
have
been
hers
george
ordered
an
operating
table
on
which
to
massage
his
patients
a
few
other
necessities
and
in
high
spirits
went
about
fixing
up
his
office
and
finishing
his
school
he
spent
hours
in
the
woodshed
with
the
remainder
of
kate
white
paint
making
a
sign
to
hang
in
front
of
the
house
he
was
so
pathetically
anxious
for
a
patient
after
he
had
put
his
table
in
place
hung
up
his
sign
and
paid
for
an
announcement
in
the
county
paper
and
the
little
walden
sheet
that
kate
was
sorry
for
him
on
a
hot
july
morning
holt
was
sweeping
the
front
porch
when
a
forlorn
specimen
of
humanity
came
shuffling
up
the
front
walk
and
asked
to
see
holt
holt
took
him
into
the
office
and
ran
to
the
garden
to
tell
george
his
first
patient
had
come
his
face
had
been
flushed
from
pulling
weeds
but
it
paled
perceptibly
as
he
started
to
the
back
porch
to
wash
his
hands
do
you
know
who
it
is
mother
he
asked
it
that
old
peter
mines
she
said
an
he
looks
fit
to
drop
peter
mines
said
george
he
had
about
fifty
things
the
matter
with
him
for
about
fifty
years
then
you
a
made
man
if
you
can
even
make
him
think
he
feels
enough
better
so
he
go
round
talking
about
it
said
holt
shrewdly
george
stood
with
his
hands
dripping
water
an
instant
thinking
deeply
well
said
for
once
old
lady
he
agreed
you
are
just
exactly
right
he
hurried
to
his
room
and
put
on
his
coat
a
patient
that
will
be
a
big
boom
for
me
he
boasted
to
kate
as
he
went
down
the
hall
holt
stood
listening
at
the
hall
door
kate
walked
around
the
dining
room
trying
to
occupy
herself
presently
cringing
groans
began
to
come
from
the
room
mingling
with
george
deep
voice
explaining
and
trying
to
encourage
the
man
then
came
a
wild
shriek
and
then
silence
kate
hurried
out
to
the
back
walk
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
sunshine
she
did
not
know
it
but
she
was
praying
a
minute
later
george
pallid
face
appeared
at
the
back
door
you
come
in
here
quick
and
help
me
he
demanded
what
the
matter
asked
kate
he
fainted
his
heart
i
think
he
got
everything
that
ever
ailed
a
man
he
said
oh
george
you
should
have
touched
him
said
kate
ca
you
see
it
will
make
me
if
i
can
help
him
even
mother
could
see
that
he
cried
but
if
his
heart
is
bad
the
risk
of
massaging
him
is
awful
said
kate
as
she
hurried
after
george
kate
looked
at
the
man
on
the
table
ran
her
hand
over
the
heart
region
and
lifted
terrified
eyes
to
george
do
you
think
he
stammered
sure
of
it
she
said
but
we
can
try
bring
your
camphor
bottle
and
some
water
she
cried
to
holt
for
a
few
minutes
they
worked
frantically
then
kate
stepped
back
i
scared
and
i
do
care
who
knows
it
she
said
i
going
after
dr
james
no

are
not
cried
george
you
just
hold
yourself
i
have
him
out
in
a
minute
begin
at
his
feet
and
rub
the
blood
up
to
his
heart
they
are
swollen
to
a
puff
he
got
no
circulation
said
kate
oh
george
how
could
you
ever
hope
to
do
anything
for
a
man
in
this
shape
with
muscular
treatment
you
keep
still
and
rub
for
god
sake
he
cried
frantically
you
see
that
i
am
ruined
if
he
dies
on
this
table
no
i
ca
said
kate
everybody
would
know
that
he
was
practically
dying
when
he
came
here
nobody
will
blame
you
only
you
never
should
have
touched
him
george
i
am
going
after
dr
james
well

then
he
said
wildly
kate
started
holt
blocked
the
doorway
you
just
stop
missy
she
cried
you
away
too
smart
trying
to
get
folks
in
here
and
ruin
my
george
chances
you
just
stay
where
you
are
till
i
think
what
to
do
to
put
the
best
face
on
this
he
may
not
be
really
gone
the
doctor
might
save
him
cried
kate
holt
looked
long
at
the
man
he
deader
a
doornail
she
said
you
stay
where
you
are
kate
picked
her
up
by
the
shoulders
set
her
to
one
side
ran
from
the
room
and
down
the
street
as
fast
as
possible
she
found
the
doctor
in
his
office
with
two
patients
she
had
no
time
to
think
or
temporize
get
your
case
and
come
to
our
house
quick
doctor
she
cried
an
old
man
they
call
peter
mines
came
to
see
george
and
his
heart
has
failed
please
hurry
heart
eh
said
the
doctor
well
wait
a
minute
no
use
to
go
about
a
bad
heart
without
digitalis
he
got
up
and
put
on
his
hat
told
the
men
he
would
be
back
soon
and
went
to
the
nearest
drug
store
kate
followed
the
men
who
had
been
in
the
office
came
also
doctor
hurry
she
panted
i
so
frightened
you
go
to
some
of
the
neighbours
and
stay
away
from
there
he
said
hurry
begged
kate
oh
do
hurry
she
was
beside
him
as
they
sped
down
the
street
and
at
his
shoulder
as
they
entered
the
room
with
one
glance
she
lurched
against
the
casing
and
then
she
plunged
down
the
hall
entered
her
room
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
threw
herself
on
the
bed
she
had
only
a
glance
but
in
that
glance
she
had
seen
peter
mines
sitting
fully
clothed
his
hat
on
his
head
his
stick
in
his
hands
in
her
easy
chair
the
operating
table
folded
and
standing
against
the
wall
holt
holding
the
camphor
bottle
to
peter
nose
while
george
had
one
hand
over
heart
the
other
steadying
his
head
the
doctor
swung
the
table
in
place
and
with
george
help
laid
peter
on
it
then
began
tearing
open
his
clothes
as
they
worked
the
two
men
followed
into
the
house
to
see
if
they
could
do
anything
and
excited
neighbours
began
to
gather
george
and
his
mother
explained
how
peter
had
exhausted
himself
walking
two
miles
from
the
country
that
hot
morning
how
he
had
entered
the
office
tottering
with
fatigue
and
had
fallen
in
the
chair
in
a
fainting
condition
everything
was
plausible
until
a
neighbour
woman
eager
to
be
the
centre
of
attention
for
a
second
cried
yes
we
all
see
him
come
an
hour
ago
and
when
he
begin
to
let
out
the
yells
we
says
to
each
other
george
has
got
his
first
patient
sure
an
we
all
kind
of
waited
to
see
if
he
come
out
better
the
doctor
looked
at
her
sharply
more
than
an
hour
ago
he
said
you
heard
cries
yes
a
good
hour
ago
yes
we
all
heard
him
yell
jist
once
good
and
loud
she
said
the
doctor
turned
to
george
before
he
could
speak
his
mother
intervened
that
was
our
kate
done
the
yellin
she
said
she
was
scart
crazy
from
the
start
he
jest
come
in
and
set
in
the
chair
and
he
been
there
ever
since
you
did
give
him
any
treatment
holt
asked
the
doctor
again
holt
answered
never
touched
him
had
even
got
time
to
get
his
table
open
nothing
he
could
done
for
him
anyway
peter
was
good
as
gone
when
he
got
here
his
fool
folks
never
ought
let
him
out
this
hot
day
sick
as
he
was
the
doctor
looked
at
george
at
his
mother
long
at
peter
he
surely
was
too
sick
to
walk
that
far
in
this
heat
he
said
but
to
make
sure
i
look
him
over
george
you
help
me
clear
the
room
of
all
but
these
two
men
he
began
minutely
examining
peter
heart
region
then
he
rolled
him
over
and
started
to
compress
his
lungs
long
white
streaks
marked
the
puffy
red
of
the
swollen
dropsical
flesh
the
doctor
examined
the
length
of
the
body
and
looked
straight
into
george
holt
eyes
no
use
he
said
bill
go
to
the
in
my
office
and
tell
coroner
smith
to
get
here
from
hartley
as
soon
as
he
can
all
left
to
do
here
is
to
obey
the
law
and
have
a
funeral
better
some
of
the
rest
of
you
go
tell
his
folks
i
done
all
i
can
do
it
up
to
the
coroner
now
the
rest
of
you
go
home
and
keep
still
till
he
comes
when
he
and
george
were
left
alone
he
said
tersely
of
course
you
and
your
mother
are
lying
you
had
this
man
stripped
he
did
cry
out
and
he
did
die
from
the
pain
of
the
treatment
you
tried
to
give
him
in
his
condition
by
the
way
where
your
wife
this
is
a
bad
thing
for
her
right
now
come
let
find
her
and
see
what
state
she
is
in
together
they
left
the
room
and
entered
kate
door
as
soon
as
the
doctor
was
busy
with
her
george
slipped
back
into
the
closed
room
rolled
peter
on
his
back
and
covered
him
in
the
hope
that
the
blood
would
settle
until
it
would
efface
the
marks
of
his
work
before
the
coroner
arrived
by
that
time
the
doctor
was
too
busy
to
care
much
what
happened
to
peter
mines
he
was
a
poor
old
soul
better
off
as
he
was
across
kate
unconscious
body
he
said
to
george
holt
going
to
let
the
coroner
make
what
he
pleases
out
of
this
solely
for
your
wife
sake
but
two
things
take
down
that
shingle
take
it
down
now
and
never
put
it
up
again
if
you
want
me
to
keep
still
give
you
what
you
paid
for
that
table
it
a
good
one
get
him
out
as
soon
as
you
can
set
him
in
another
room
i
got
to
have
holt
where
i
can
work
and
send
sarah
nepple
here
to
help
me
move
fast
this
is
going
to
be
a
close
call
and
the
other
thing
heard
you
put
in
an
application
for
our
school
this
winter
withdraw
it
now
move
so
they
set
peter
in
the
living
room
cleaned
kate
room
quickly
and
moved
in
her
bed
by
the
time
the
coroner
arrived
the
doctor
was
too
busy
to
care
what
happened
on
oath
he
said
a
few
words
that
he
hoped
would
make
life
easier
for
kate
and
at
the
same
time
pass
muster
for
truth
told
the
coroner
what
witnesses
to
call
and
gave
an
opinion
as
to
peter
condition
he
also
added
that
he
was
sure
peter
family
would
be
very
glad
he
was
to
suffer
no
more
and
then
he
went
back
to
kate
who
was
suffering
entirely
too
much
for
safety
then
began
a
long
vigil
that
ended
at
midnight
with
kate
barely
alive
and
sarah
nepple
the
walden
trying
to
divide
a
scanty
wardrobe
between
a
pair
of
lusty
twins
chapter
xv
a
new
idea
kate
slowly
came
back
to
consciousness
she
was
conscious
of
her
body
sore
from
head
to
foot
with
plenty
of
pain
in
definite
spots
her
first
clear
thought
was
that
she
was
such
a
big
woman
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
filled
the
room
when
she
was
one
bruised
ache
from
head
to
heels
then
she
became
conscious
of
a
moving
bundle
on
the
bed
beside
her
and
laid
her
hand
on
it
to
reassure
herself
the
size
and
shape
of
the
bundle
were
not
reassuring
oh
lord
groaned
kate
have
you
any
mercy
at
all
it
was
your
advice
i
followed
when
i
took
wing
and
started
out
in
life
a
big
sob
arose
in
her
throat
while
at
the
same
time
she
began
to
laugh
weakly
james
heard
her
from
the
hall
and
entered
hastily
at
the
sight
of
him
kate
eyes
filled
with
terrified
remembrance
her
glance
swept
the
room
and
rested
on
her
rocking
chair
take
that
out
of
here
she
cried
take
it
out
split
it
into
kindling
wood
and
burn
it
all
right
said
james
calmly
i
guarantee
that
you
never
see
it
again
is
there
anything
else
you
want
you
you
did
the
doctor
shook
his
head
very
sorry
he
said
but
there
was
a
thing
could
be
done
where
is
he
she
asked
in
a
whisper
his
people
took
him
home
immediately
after
the
coroner
inquest
which
found
that
he
died
from
heart
failure
brought
on
by
his
long
walk
in
the
heat
kate
stared
at
him
with
a
face
pitiful
to
behold
you
let
him
think
that
she
whispered
again
i
did
said
the
old
doctor
i
thought
and
still
think
that
for
the
sake
of
you
and
yours
he
waved
toward
the
bundle
it
was
the
only
course
to
pursue
thank
you
said
kate
you
very
kind
but
do
you
think
that
i
and
mine
are
going
to
take
a
lot
of
shielding
the
next
man
may
not
be
so
kindly
disposed
besides
is
it
right
is
it
honest
it
is
for
you
said
the
doctor
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
if
you
had
things
would
not
have
gone
as
they
did
as
for
me
i
feel
perfectly
comfortable
about
it
in
my
conscience
which
is
my
best
guide
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
let
them
tell
their
story
i
perjured
myself
only
to
the
extent
of
testifying
that
you
knew
nothing
about
it
the
coroner
could
well
believe
that
george
and
his
mother
could
easily
manage
the
remainder
kate
waved
toward
the
bundle
am
i
supposed
to
welcome
and
love
them
a
poet
might
expect
you
to
said
the
doctor
in
the
circumstances
i
do
not
i
shall
feel
that
you
have
done
your
whole
duty
if
you
will
try
to
nurse
them
when
the
time
comes
you
must
have
a
long
rest
and
they
must
grow
some
before
you
discover
what
they
mean
to
you
there
always
as
much
chance
that
they
resemble
your
people
as
that
they
will
not
the
boy
will
have
dark
hair
and
eyes
i
think
but
he
looks
exactly
like
you
the
girl
is
more
holt
where
is
george
she
asked
he
was
completely
upset
said
the
doctor
i
suggested
that
he
go
somewhere
to
rest
up
a
few
days
so
he
took
his
tackle
and
went
fishing
and
to
the
farm
should
he
have
stayed
and
faced
it
asked
kate
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
face
except
himself
kate
said
the
doctor
kate
shook
her
head
she
looked
ghastly
doctor
she
said
could
you
have
let
me
die
and
left
your
son
and
your
little
daughter
to
them
he
asked
no
kate
i
could
have
let
you
die
because
you
your
work
in
the
world
under
your
hand
right
now
he
said
that
because
when
he
said
left
your
son
and
your
little
daughter
to
them
kate
had
reached
over
and
laid
her
hand
possessively
defensively
on
the
little
squirming
bundle
which
was
all
james
asked
of
her
presently
she
looked
the
doctor
straight
in
the
face
exactly
what
do
you
know
she
asked
everything
said
the
doctor
and
you
everything
said
kate
there
was
a
long
silence
then
kate
spoke
slowly
that
george
know
that
he
should
have
touched
that
man
proves
him
completely
incompetent
she
said
that
he
did
and
did
have
the
courage
to
face
the
results
proves
him
lacking
in
principle
he
not
fit
for
either
work
to
which
he
aspires
you
are
talking
too
much
said
the
doctor
nurse
nepple
is
in
charge
here
and
aunt
ollie
george
mother
went
to
the
farm
to
cook
for
him
you
in
the
hands
of
two
fine
women
who
will
make
you
comfortable
you
have
escaped
lasting
disgrace
with
your
skirts
clear
now
rest
and
be
thankful
i
ca
rest
until
i
know
one
thing
said
kate
you
not
going
to
allow
george
to
kill
any
one
else
no
said
the
doctor
i
regretted
telling
him
very
much
but
i
had
to
tell
him
that
could
not
happen
and
about
the
school
she
asked
i
half
thought
he
might
get
it
he
wo
said
the
doctor
i
in
a
position
to
know
that
now
try
to
take
some
rest
kate
waved
toward
the
babies
will
you
please
take
them
away
until
they
need
me
she
asked
of
course
said
the
doctor
but
do
you
want
to
see
them
kate
there
is
a
mark
or
blemish
on
either
of
them
the
boy
weighs
seven
pounds
and
the
girl
six
they
seem
as
perfect
as
children
can
be
you
need
worry
about
that
said
kate
twins
are
a
bates
habit
my
mother
had
three
pairs
always
a
boy
and
a
girl
always
big
and
sound
as
any
children
mine
will
be
all
right
too
the
doctor
started
to
turn
back
the
blanket
kate
turned
her
head
away
do
you
think
i
have
had
about
enough
at
present
she
asked
i
stake
my
life
that
as
a
little
further
piece
of
my
punishment
the
girl
looks
exactly
like
mrs
holt
by
jove
said
the
doctor
i
could
just
think
who
it
was
he
carried
the
babies
from
the
room
lowered
the
blinds
and
kate
tried
to
sleep
and
did
sleep
because
she
was
so
exhausted
she
could
not
keep
awake
later
in
the
evening
aunt
ollie
slipped
in
and
said
george
was
in
the
woodhouse
almost
crying
himself
to
death
and
begging
to
see
her
you
tell
him
i
too
sick
to
be
seen
for
at
least
a
week
said
kate
but
my
dear
he
so
broken
up
he
feels
so
badly
begged
aunt
ollie
so
do
i
said
kate
i
feel
entirely
too
badly
to
be
worried
over
seeing
him
i
must
take
the
babies
now
i
do
wish
you
would
persisted
aunt
ollie
well
i
wo
said
kate
i
do
care
if
i
never
see
him
again
he
knows
why
he
is
crying
ask
him
i
wager
they
ai
a
word
of
truth
in
that
tale
they
telling
she
said
kate
looked
straight
at
her
well
for
their
sakes
and
my
sake
and
the
babies
sake
do
talk
about
it
you
poor
thing
said
aunt
ollie
i
do
anything
in
the
world
to
help
you
if
ever
you
need
me
just
call
on
me
i
go
start
him
back
in
a
hurry
he
came
every
night
but
kate
steadily
refused
until
she
felt
able
to
sit
up
in
a
chair
to
see
him
or
his
mother
when
she
came
to
see
the
babies
she
had
recovered
rapidly
was
over
the
painful
part
of
nursing
the
babies
and
had
a
long
talk
with
aunt
ollie
before
she
consented
to
see
george
at
times
she
thought
she
never
could
see
him
again
at
others
she
realized
her
helplessness
she
had
her
babies
to
nurse
for
a
year
there
was
nothing
she
could
think
of
she
knew
to
do
that
she
could
do
and
take
proper
care
of
two
children
she
was
tied
hand
and
foot
as
aunt
ollie
said
and
yet
it
was
aunt
ollie
who
solved
her
problem
for
her
sitting
beside
the
bed
one
day
she
said
to
kate
my
dear
do
you
know
that
i
having
a
mighty
good
time
i
guess
i
was
lonesomer
than
i
thought
out
there
all
alone
so
much
and
the
work
was
nigh
to
breaking
me
during
the
long
cold
winter
i
got
a
big
notion
to
propose
somepin
to
you
that
might
be
a
comfort
to
all
of
us
propose
away
said
kate
i
at
my
wit
end
well
what
would
you
think
of
you
and
george
taking
the
land
working
it
on
the
shares
and
letting
me
have
this
room
an
live
in
walden
awhile
kate
sat
straight
up
in
bed
oh
aunt
ollie
would
you
she
cried
would
you
that
would
be
a
mercy
to
me
it
would
give
george
every
chance
to
go
straight
if
there
is
a
straight
impulse
in
him
yes
i
will
said
aunt
ollie
and
you
need
feel
that
i
am
getting
the
little
end
of
the
bargain
either
the
only
unpleasant
thing
about
it
will
be
my
sister
and
i
undertake
to
manage
her
i
read
a
lot
an
i
can
always
come
to
see
you
when
mortal
sperrits
will
bear
her
no
more
she
be
no
such
trial
to
me
as
she
is
to
you
you
an
angel
said
kate
you
given
me
hope
where
i
had
not
a
glimmer
if
i
have
george
out
there
alone
away
from
his
mother
i
can
bring
out
all
the
good
there
is
in
him
and
we
can
get
some
results
out
of
life
or
i
can
assure
myself
that
it
is
impossible
so
that
i
can
quit
with
a
clear
conscience
i
do
thank
you
all
right
then
i
go
out
and
begin
packing
my
things
and
see
about
moving
this
afternoon
i
leave
my
stoves
and
beds
and
tables
and
chairs
for
you
you
can
use
your
wedding
things
and
be
downright
comfortable
i
like
living
in
town
a
spell
real
well
so
once
more
kate
saw
hope
a
beckoning
star
in
the
distance
and
ruffled
the
wings
of
the
spirit
preparatory
to
another
flight
only
a
short
humble
flight
this
time
close
earth
but
still
as
full
of
promise
as
life
seemed
to
hold
in
any
direction
for
her
she
greeted
george
casually
and
as
if
nothing
had
happened
when
she
was
ready
to
see
him
you
at
the
place
where
words
are
not
of
the
slightest
use
to
me
she
said
i
giving
you
one
and
a
final
chance
to
act
this
seems
all
that
is
open
to
us
go
to
work
like
a
man
and
we
will
see
what
we
can
make
of
our
last
chance
kate
was
so
glad
when
she
sat
in
the
carriage
that
was
to
take
her
from
the
house
and
the
woman
she
abominated
that
she
could
scarcely
behave
properly
she
clasped
adam
tightly
in
her
arms
and
felt
truly
his
mother
she
reached
over
and
tucked
the
blanket
closer
over
polly
but
she
did
not
carry
her
because
she
resembled
her
grandmother
while
adam
was
a
bates
george
drove
carefully
he
was
on
behaviour
too
good
to
last
but
fortunately
both
women
with
him
knew
him
well
enough
not
to
expect
that
it
would
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
house
kate
could
see
that
the
grass
beside
the
road
had
been
cut
the
trees
trimmed
and
oh
joy
the
house
freshly
painted
a
soft
creamy
white
she
liked
with
a
green
roof
aunt
ollie
explained
that
she
furnished
the
paint
and
george
did
the
work
he
had
swung
oblong
clothes
baskets
from
the
ceiling
of
a
big
cheery
bedroom
for
a
cradle
for
each
baby
and
established
himself
in
a
small
back
room
adjoining
the
kitchen
kate
said
nothing
about
the
arrangement
because
she
supposed
it
had
been
made
to
give
her
more
room
and
that
george
might
sleep
in
peace
while
she
wrestled
with
two
tiny
babies
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
wrestling
the
babies
seemed
of
nervous
temperament
sleeping
in
short
naps
and
lightly
kate
was
on
her
feet
from
the
time
she
reached
her
new
home
working
when
she
should
not
have
worked
so
that
the
result
developed
cross
babies
each
attacked
with
the
colic
which
raged
every
night
from
six
until
twelve
and
after
both
frequently
shrieking
at
the
same
time
george
did
his
share
by
going
to
town
for
a
bottle
of
soothing
syrup
which
kate
promptly
threw
in
the
creek
once
he
took
adam
and
began
walking
the
floor
with
him
extending
his
activities
as
far
as
the
kitchen
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
the
little
fellow
sound
asleep
and
he
did
not
waken
until
morning
then
he
seemed
to
droop
and
feel
listless
when
he
took
the
baby
the
second
time
and
made
the
same
trip
to
the
kitchen
kate
laid
polly
on
her
bed
and
silently
followed
she
saw
george
lay
the
baby
on
the
table
draw
a
flask
from
his
pocket
pour
a
spoon
partly
full
filling
it
the
remainder
of
the
way
from
the
teakettle
as
he
was
putting
the
spoon
to
the
baby
lips
kate
stepped
beside
him
and
taking
it
she
tasted
the
contents
then
she
threw
the
spoon
into
the
dishpan
standing
near
and
picked
up
the
baby
i
knew
it
she
said
only
i
did
know
what
he
acted
like
a
drugged
baby
all
last
night
and
since
when
did
you
begin
carrying
that
stuff
around
with
you
and
feeding
it
to
tiny
babies
it
a
good
thing
james
recommended
it
he
said
it
was
harmful
to
let
them
strain
themselves
crying
and
very
hard
on
you
you
could
save
yourself
a
lot
he
urged
i
need
saving
all
right
said
kate
but
i
have
a
picture
of
myself
saving
myself
by
drugging
a
pair
of
tiny
babies
he
slipped
the
bottle
back
in
his
pocket
kate
stood
looking
at
him
so
long
and
so
intently
he
flushed
and
set
the
flask
on
a
shelf
in
the
pantry
it
may
come
in
handy
some
day
when
some
of
us
have
a
cold
he
said
kate
did
her
best
but
she
was
so
weakened
by
nursing
both
of
the
babies
by
loss
of
sleep
and
overwork
in
the
house
that
she
was
no
help
whatever
to
george
in
getting
in
the
fall
crops
and
preparing
for
spring
she
had
lost
none
of
her
ambition
but
there
was
a
limit
to
her
capacity
in
the
spring
the
babies
were
big
and
lusty
eating
her
up
and
crying
with
hunger
until
she
was
forced
to
resort
to
artificial
feeding
in
part
which
did
not
agree
with
either
of
them
as
a
saving
of
time
and
trouble
she
decided
to
nurse
one
and
feed
the
other
it
was
without
thought
on
her
part
almost
by
chance
yet
the
chance
was
that
she
nursed
adam
and
fed
polly
then
the
babies
began
teething
so
that
she
was
rushed
to
find
time
to
prepare
three
regular
meals
a
day
and
as
for
the
garden
and
poultry
she
had
planned
george
did
what
he
pleased
about
them
which
was
little
if
anything
he
would
raise
so
much
to
keep
from
being
hungry
he
would
grow
so
many
roots
and
so
much
cabbage
for
winter
he
would
tend
enough
corn
for
a
team
and
to
fatten
pork
right
there
he
stopped
and
went
fishing
while
the
flask
was
in
evidence
on
the
pantry
shelf
only
two
days
kate
talked
crop
rotation
new
seed
fertilization
until
she
was
weary
george
heartily
agreed
with
her
but
put
nothing
of
it
all
into
practice
as
soon
as
the
babies
are
old
enough
to
be
taken
out
she
said
things
will
be
better
i
just
ca
do
justice
to
them
and
my
work
too
three
pairs
my
poor
mother
and
she
alive
yet
i
marvel
at
it
so
they
lived
and
had
enough
to
eat
and
were
clothed
but
not
one
step
did
they
advance
toward
kate
ideals
of
progression
economy
accumulation
george
always
had
a
little
money
more
than
she
could
see
how
he
got
from
the
farming
there
were
a
few
calves
and
pigs
to
sell
occasionally
she
thought
possibly
he
saved
his
share
from
them
for
four
years
kate
struggled
valiantly
to
keep
pace
with
what
her
mother
always
had
done
and
had
required
of
her
at
home
but
she
learned
long
before
she
quit
struggling
that
farming
with
george
was
hopeless
so
at
last
she
became
so
discouraged
she
began
to
drift
into
his
way
of
doing
merely
what
would
sustain
them
and
then
reading
fishing
or
sleeping
the
remainder
of
the
time
she
began
teaching
her
children
while
very
small
and
daily
they
had
their
lessons
after
dinner
while
their
father
slept
kate
thought
often
of
what
was
happening
to
her
she
hated
it
she
fought
it
but
with
george
holt
for
a
partner
she
could
not
escape
it
she
lay
awake
nights
planning
ways
to
make
a
start
toward
prosperity
she
propounded
her
ideas
at
breakfast
to
save
time
in
getting
him
early
to
work
she
began
feeding
the
horses
as
soon
as
she
was
up
so
that
george
could
go
to
work
immediately
after
breakfast
but
she
soon
found
she
might
as
well
save
her
strength
he
would
not
start
to
harness
until
he
had
smoked
mostly
three
quarters
of
an
hour
that
his
neighbours
laughed
at
him
and
got
ahead
of
him
bothered
him
not
at
all
all
they
said
and
all
kate
said
went
as
he
expressed
it
in
at
one
ear
out
at
the
other
one
day
in
going
around
the
house
kate
was
suddenly
confronted
by
a
thing
she
might
have
seen
for
three
years
but
had
not
noticed
leading
from
the
path
of
bare
earth
that
ran
around
the
house
through
the
grass
was
a
small
forking
path
not
so
wide
and
well
defined
yet
a
path
leading
to
george
window
she
stood
staring
at
it
a
long
time
with
a
thoughtful
expression
on
her
face
that
night
she
did
not
go
to
bed
when
she
went
to
her
room
instead
she
slipped
out
into
the
night
and
sitting
under
a
sheltering
bush
she
watched
that
window
it
was
only
a
short
time
until
george
crawled
from
it
went
stealthily
to
the
barn
and
a
few
minutes
later
she
saw
him
riding
barebacked
on
one
of
the
horses
he
had
bridled
down
the
footpath
beside
the
stream
toward
town
she
got
up
and
crossing
the
barnyard
shut
the
gate
after
him
and
closed
the
barn
door
she
went
back
to
the
house
and
closed
his
window
and
lighting
a
lamp
set
it
on
his
dresser
in
front
of
his
small
clock
his
door
was
open
in
the
morning
when
she
passed
it
on
her
way
to
the
kitchen
so
she
got
breakfast
instead
of
feeding
the
horses
he
came
in
slowly
furtively
watching
her
she
worked
as
usual
saying
no
unpleasant
word
at
length
he
could
endure
it
no
longer
kate
he
said
i
broke
a
bolt
in
the
plow
yesterday
and
i
never
thought
of
it
until
just
as
i
was
getting
into
bed
so
to
save
time
i
rode
in
to
walden
and
got
another
last
night
ai
i
a
great
old
economist
though
you
are
a
great
something
she
said
would
scarcely
be
my
name
for
it
really
george
ca
you
do
better
than
that
better
than
what
he
demanded
better
than
telling
such
palpable
lies
she
said
better
than
crawling
out
windows
instead
of
using
your
doors
like
a
man
better
than
being
the
most
shiftless
farmer
of
your
neighbourhood
in
the
daytime
because
you
have
spend
most
of
your
nights
god
and
probably
all
walden
know
how
the
flask
and
ready
money
i
never
could
understand
give
me
an
inkling
anything
else
he
asked
sneeringly
nothing
at
present
said
kate
placidly
i
probably
could
find
plenty
if
i
spent
even
one
night
in
walden
when
you
thought
i
was
asleep
go
if
you
like
he
said
if
you
think
i
going
to
stay
here
working
like
a
dog
all
day
year
in
and
year
out
to
support
a
daughter
of
the
richest
man
in
the
county
and
her
kids
you
fool
yourself
if
you
want
more
than
you
got
call
on
your
rich
folks
for
it
if
you
want
to
go
to
town
either
night
or
day
go
for
all
i
care
do
what
you
damn
please
that
what
i
am
going
to
do
in
the
future
and
glad
you
know
it
i
tired
climbing
through
windows
and
slinking
like
a
dog
i
come
and
go
like
other
men
after
this
i
do
know
what
other
men
you
are
referring
to
said
kate
you
have
a
monopoly
of
your
kind
in
this
neighbourhood
there
is
none
other
like
you
you
crawl
and
slink
as
the
manner
born
do
you
go
too
far
he
menaced
with
an
ugly
leer
keep
that
for
your
mother
laughed
kate
you
need
never
try
a
threat
with
me
i
am
stronger
than
you
are
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
i
shall
see
that
my
strength
never
fails
me
again
i
know
now
that
you
are
all
nancy
ellen
said
you
were
well
if
you
married
me
knowing
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
he
sneered
i
did
know
it
then
i
thought
i
knew
you
i
thought
she
had
been
misinformed
said
kate
in
well
he
said
insultingly
if
you
had
been
in
such
a
big
hurry
you
could
soon
have
found
out
all
you
wanted
to
know
i
took
advantage
of
it
but
i
never
did
understand
your
rush
you
never
will
said
kate
then
she
arose
and
went
to
see
if
the
children
had
wakened
all
day
she
was
thinking
so
deeply
she
would
stumble
over
the
chairs
in
her
preoccupation
george
noticed
it
and
it
frightened
him
after
supper
he
came
and
sat
on
the
porch
beside
her
kate
he
said
as
usual
you
are
mountains
out
of
mole
hills
it
does
damn
a
fellow
forever
to
ride
or
walk
i
almost
always
walk
into
town
in
the
evening
to
see
the
papers
and
have
a
little
visit
with
the
boys
work
all
day
in
a
field
is
mighty
lonesome
a
man
has
got
the
have
a
little
change
i
do
deny
a
glass
of
beer
once
in
awhile
or
a
game
of
cards
with
the
boys
occasionally
but
if
you
have
lived
with
me
over
five
years
here
and
never
suspected
it
before
it
ca
be
so
desperately
bad
can
it
come
now
be
fair
it
no
difference
whether
i
am
fair
or
unfair
kate
said
wearily
it
explains
why
you
simply
will
not
brace
up
and
be
a
real
man
and
do
a
man
work
in
the
world
and
achieve
a
man
success
who
can
get
anywhere
splitting
everything
in
halves
he
demanded
the
most
successful
men
in
this
neighbourhood
got
their
start
exactly
that
way
she
said
ah
well
farming
ai
my
job
anyway
he
said
i
always
did
hate
it
i
always
will
if
i
could
have
a
little
capital
to
start
with
i
know
a
trick
that
would
suit
you
and
make
us
independent
in
no
time
kate
said
no
word
and
seeing
she
was
not
going
to
he
continued
thought
about
this
till
i
got
it
all
down
fine
and
it
a
great
scheme
you
admit
that
even
angry
as
you
are
it
is
this
get
enough
together
to
build
a
saw
mill
on
my
strip
of
ravine
a
little
damming
would
make
a
free
water
power
worth
a
fortune
i
could
hire
a
good
man
to
run
the
saw
and
do
the
work
and
i
could
take
a
horse
and
ride
or
drive
around
among
the
farmers
i
know
and
buy
up
timber
cheaper
than
most
men
could
get
it
i
could
just
skin
the
eyes
out
of
them
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
you
could
do
better
by
being
honest
asked
kate
wearily
aw
well
smarty
you
know
i
did
mean
that
literally
he
scoffed
you
know
i
only
meant
i
could
talk
and
jolly
and
buy
at
prices
i
know
where
to
get
the
timber
and
the
two
best
mill
men
in
the
country
we
are
near
the
railroad
it
the
dandiest
scheme
that
ever
struck
walden
what
do
you
think
about
it
i
think
if
adam
had
it
he
be
rich
from
it
in
ten
years
she
said
quietly
then
you
do
think
it
a
bully
idea
he
cried
you
would
try
it
if
we
had
a
chance
i
might
said
kate
you
know
he
cried
jumping
up
in
excitement
i
never
mentioned
this
to
a
soul
but
i
got
it
all
thought
out
would
you
go
to
see
your
brother
adam
and
see
if
you
could
get
him
to
take
an
interest
for
young
adam
he
could
manage
the
money
himself
i
would
go
to
a
relative
of
mine
for
a
cent
even
if
the
children
were
starving
said
kate
get
and
keep
that
clear
in
your
head
but
you
think
there
is
something
in
it
he
persisted
i
know
there
is
said
kate
with
finality
in
the
hands
of
the
right
man
and
with
the
capital
to
start
kate
you
can
be
the
meanest
he
said
i
did
intend
to
be
in
this
particular
instance
she
said
but
honestly
george
what
have
i
ever
seen
of
you
in
the
way
of
financial
success
in
the
past
that
would
give
me
hope
for
the
future
i
know
it
he
said
but
i
never
struck
exactly
the
right
thing
this
is
what
i
could
make
a
success
of
and
i
would
make
a
good
big
one
you
bet
kate
i
not
go
to
town
another
night
i
stop
all
that
he
drew
the
flask
from
his
pocket
and
smashed
it
against
the
closest
tree
and
i
stop
all
there
ever
was
of
that
even
to
a
glass
of
beer
on
a
hot
day
if
you
say
so
if
you
stand
by
me
this
once
more
if
i
fail
this
time
i
never
ask
you
again
honest
i
wo
if
i
had
money
i
try
it
keeping
the
building
in
my
own
name
and
keeping
the
books
myself
but
i
none
and
no
way
to
get
any
as
you
know
she
said
i
can
see
what
could
be
done
but
i
helpless
i
not
said
george
i
got
it
all
worked
out
you
see
i
was
doing
something
useful
with
my
head
if
i
was
always
plowing
as
fast
as
you
thought
i
should
if
you
back
me
if
you
keep
books
if
you
handle
the
money
until
she
is
paid
back
i
know
aunt
ollie
will
sell
enough
of
this
land
to
build
the
mill
and
buy
the
machinery
she
could
keep
the
house
and
orchard
and
barn
and
a
big
enough
piece
say
forty
acres
to
live
on
and
keep
all
of
us
in
grub
she
and
mother
could
move
out
here
she
said
the
other
day
she
was
tired
of
town
and
getting
homesick
and
we
could
go
to
town
to
put
the
children
in
school
and
be
on
the
job
i
wo
ever
ask
you
and
mother
to
live
together
again
kate
will
you
go
in
with
me
will
you
talk
to
aunt
ollie
will
you
let
me
show
you
and
explain
and
prove
to
you
i
wo
be
a
party
to
anything
that
would
even
remotely
threaten
to
lose
aunt
ollie
money
for
her
she
said
she
got
nobody
on
earth
but
me
it
all
mine
in
the
end
why
not
let
me
have
this
wonderful
chance
with
it
kate
will
you
he
begged
i
think
about
it
she
conceded
if
i
can
study
out
a
sure
honourable
way
i
promise
to
think
now
go
out
there
and
hunt
the
last
scrap
of
that
glass
the
children
may
cut
their
feet
in
the
morning
then
kate
went
in
to
bed
if
she
had
looked
from
her
window
she
might
have
seen
george
scratching
matches
and
picking
pieces
of
glass
from
the
grass
when
he
came
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
with
upstanding
jagged
edges
containing
a
few
drops
he
glanced
at
her
room
saw
that
she
was
undressing
in
the
dark
and
lifting
it
he
poured
the
liquid
on
his
tongue
to
the
last
drop
that
would
fall
chapter
xvi
the
work
of
the
sun
before
kate
awakened
the
following
morning
george
was
out
feeding
the
horses
cattle
and
chickens
doing
the
milking
and
working
like
the
proverbial
beaver
by
the
time
breakfast
was
ready
he
had
convinced
himself
that
he
was
a
very
exemplary
man
while
he
expected
kate
to
be
convinced
also
he
stood
ready
and
willing
to
forgive
her
for
every
mean
deceit
and
secret
sin
he
ever
had
committed
or
had
it
in
his
heart
to
commit
in
the
future
all
the
world
was
rosy
with
him
he
was
flying
with
the
wings
of
hope
straight
toward
a
wonderful
achievement
that
would
bring
pleasure
and
riches
first
to
george
holt
then
to
his
wife
and
children
then
to
the
old
aunt
he
really
cared
more
for
than
any
one
else
incidentally
his
mother
might
have
some
share
while
he
would
bring
such
prosperity
and
activity
to
the
village
that
all
walden
would
forget
every
bad
thing
it
had
ever
thought
or
known
of
him
and
delight
to
pay
him
honour
kate
might
have
guessed
all
this
when
she
saw
the
pails
full
of
milk
on
the
table
and
heard
george
whistling
hail
the
conquering
hero
comes
as
he
turned
the
cows
into
the
pasture
but
she
had
not
slept
well
most
of
the
night
she
had
lain
staring
at
the
ceiling
her
brain
busy
with
calculations
computations
most
of
all
with
personal
values
she
dared
not
be
a
party
to
anything
that
would
lose
aunt
ollie
her
land
that
was
settled
but
if
she
went
into
the
venture
herself
if
she
kept
the
deeds
in
aunt
ollie
name
the
bank
account
in
hers
drew
all
the
checks
kept
the
books
would
it
be
safe
could
george
buy
timber
as
he
thought
could
she
herself
if
he
failed
the
children
were
old
enough
to
be
in
school
now
she
could
have
much
of
the
day
she
could
soon
train
polly
and
adam
to
do
even
more
than
sweep
and
run
errands
the
scheme
could
be
materialized
in
the
bates
way
without
a
doubt
but
could
it
be
done
in
a
bates
way
hampered
and
impeded
by
george
holt
was
the
plan
feasible
after
all
she
entered
into
the
rosy
cloud
enveloping
the
kitchen
without
ever
catching
the
faintest
gleam
of
its
hue
george
came
to
her
the
instant
he
saw
her
and
tried
to
put
his
arm
around
her
kate
drew
back
and
looked
at
him
intently
aw
come
on
now
kate
he
said
leave
out
the
heroics
and
be
human
i
do
exactly
as
you
say
about
everything
if
you
will
help
me
wheedle
aunt
ollie
into
letting
me
have
the
money
kate
stepped
back
and
put
out
her
hands
defensively
a
rare
bargain
she
said
and
one
eminently
worthy
of
you
you
do
what
i
say
if
i
do
what
you
say
without
the
slightest
reference
as
to
whether
it
impoverishes
a
woman
who
has
always
helped
and
befriended
you
you
make
me
sick
what
biting
you
now
he
demanded
sullenly
kate
stood
tall
and
straight
before
and
above
him
if
you
have
a
good
plan
if
you
can
prove
that
it
will
work
what
is
the
necessity
for
anybody
why
not
state
what
you
propose
in
plain
unequivocal
terms
and
let
the
dear
old
soul
who
has
done
so
much
for
us
already
decide
what
she
will
do
that
what
i
meant
that
all
i
meant
he
cried
in
that
case
is
a
queer
word
to
use
i
believe
you
throw
up
the
whole
thing
i
believe
you
let
the
chance
to
be
a
rich
woman
slip
through
your
fingers
if
it
all
depended
on
your
saying
only
one
word
you
thought
was
quite
straight
he
cried
half
in
assertion
half
in
question
i
honour
you
in
that
belief
said
kate
i
most
certainly
would
then
you
turn
the
whole
thing
down
you
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
it
he
cried
plunging
into
despair
oh
i
did
say
that
said
kate
give
me
time
let
me
think
got
to
know
that
there
is
a
snare
in
it
from
the
title
of
the
land
to
the
grade
of
the
creek
bed
have
you
investigated
that
is
your
ravine
long
enough
and
wide
enough
to
dam
it
high
enough
at
our
outlet
to
get
your
power
and
yet
not
back
water
on
the
road
and
the
farmers
above
you
wo
it
freeze
in
winter
and
can
you
get
strong
enough
power
from
water
to
run
a
large
saw
i
doubt
it
oh
gee
i
never
thought
about
that
he
cried
and
if
it
would
work
did
you
figure
the
cost
of
a
dam
into
your
estimate
of
the
building
and
machinery
he
snapped
his
fingers
in
impatience
by
heck
he
cried
i
forgot
that
too
but
that
would
cost
much
look
what
we
did
in
that
ravine
just
for
fun
why
we
could
build
that
dam
ourselves
yes
strong
enough
for
conditions
in
september
but
what
about
the
january
freshet
she
said
croak
croak
you
blame
old
raven
cried
george
and
have
you
thought
continued
kate
that
there
is
no
room
on
the
bank
toward
town
to
set
your
mill
and
it
would
be
allowed
there
if
there
were
you
bet
i
have
he
said
defiantly
i
no
such
slouch
as
you
think
me
i
even
stepped
off
the
location
then
said
kate
will
you
build
a
bridge
across
the
ravine
to
reach
it
or
will
you
buy
a
strip
from
linn
and
build
a
road
george
collapsed
with
a
groan
that
the
trouble
with
you
said
kate
you
always
build
your
castle
with
not
even
sand
for
a
foundation
the
most
nebulous
of
rosy
clouds
serve
you
as
perfectly
as
granite
blocks
before
you
go
glimmering
again
double
your
estimate
to
cover
a
dam
and
a
bridge
and
a
lot
of
incidentals
that
no
one
ever
seems
able
to
include
in
a
building
contract
and
whatever
you
do
keep
a
still
head
until
we
get
these
things
figured
and
have
some
sane
idea
of
what
the
venture
would
cost
how
long
will
it
take
he
said
sullenly
i
have
an
idea
i
have
to
go
the
hartley
and
examine
the
records
and
be
sure
that
there
was
no
flaw
in
the
deeds
to
the
land
but
the
first
thing
is
to
get
a
surveyor
and
know
for
sure
if
you
have
a
that
will
work
and
not
infringe
on
your
neighbours
a
thing
like
this
ca
be
done
in
a
few
minutes
persuasive
conversation
it
will
take
weeks
it
really
seemed
as
if
it
would
take
months
kate
went
to
walden
that
afternoon
set
the
children
playing
in
the
ravine
while
she
sketched
it
made
the
best
estimate
she
could
of
its
fall
and
approved
the
curve
on
the
opposite
bank
which
george
thought
could
be
cleared
for
a
building
site
and
lumber
yard
then
she
added
a
location
for
a
dam
and
a
bridge
site
and
went
home
to
figure
and
think
the
further
she
went
in
these
processes
the
more
hopeless
the
project
seemed
she
soon
learned
that
there
must
be
an
engine
with
a
boiler
to
run
the
saw
the
dam
could
be
used
only
to
make
a
pond
to
furnish
the
water
needed
but
at
that
it
would
be
cheaper
than
to
dig
a
cistern
or
well
she
would
not
even
suggest
to
aunt
ollie
to
sell
any
of
the
home
forty
the
sale
of
the
remainder
at
the
most
hopeful
price
she
dared
estimate
would
not
bring
half
the
money
needed
and
it
would
come
in
payments
lumber
bricks
machinery
could
not
be
had
on
time
of
any
length
while
wages
were
cash
every
saturday
night
it
simply
ca
be
done
said
kate
and
stopped
thinking
about
it
so
far
as
george
knew
he
was
at
once
plunged
into
morose
moping
he
became
sullen
and
indifferent
about
the
work
ugly
with
kate
and
the
children
until
she
was
driven
almost
frantic
and
projects
nearly
as
vague
as
some
of
george
began
to
float
through
her
head
one
saturday
morning
kate
had
risen
early
and
finished
cleaning
up
her
house
baking
and
scrubbing
porches
she
had
taken
a
bath
to
freshen
and
cool
herself
and
was
standing
before
her
dresser
tucking
the
last
pins
in
her
hair
when
she
heard
a
heavy
step
on
the
porch
and
a
loud
knock
on
the
screen
door
she
stood
at
an
angle
where
she
could
peep
she
looked
as
she
reached
for
her
dress
what
she
saw
carried
her
to
the
door
forgetful
of
the
dress
adam
stood
there
white
and
shaken
steadying
himself
against
the
casing
adam
cried
kate
is
mother
he
shook
his
head
father
she
panted
he
nodded
seeming
unable
to
speak
kate
eyes
darkened
and
widened
she
gave
adam
another
glance
and
opened
the
door
come
in
she
said
when
did
it
happen
how
did
he
get
hurt
in
that
moment
she
recalled
that
she
had
left
her
father
in
perfect
health
she
had
been
gone
more
than
seven
years
in
that
time
he
could
not
fail
to
illness
how
he
had
been
hurt
was
her
first
thought
as
she
asked
the
question
she
stepped
into
her
room
and
snatched
up
her
second
best
summer
dress
waiting
for
adam
to
speak
as
she
slipped
into
it
but
speaking
seemed
to
be
a
very
difficult
thing
for
adam
he
was
slow
in
starting
and
words
dragged
and
came
singly
yesterday
tired
big
dinner
awful
hot
sunstroke
he
gone
she
cried
adam
nodded
in
that
queer
way
again
why
did
you
come
does
mother
want
me
the
questions
leaped
from
kate
lips
her
eyes
implored
him
adam
was
too
stricken
to
heed
his
sister
unspoken
plea
course
he
said
all
there
your
place
i
want
you
only
one
in
the
family
not
stark
mad
kate
straightened
tensely
and
looked
at
him
again
all
right
she
said
i
can
throw
a
few
things
in
my
telescope
write
the
children
a
note
to
take
to
their
father
in
the
field
and
we
can
stop
in
walden
and
send
aunt
ollie
out
to
cook
for
them
i
can
go
as
well
as
not
for
as
long
as
mother
wants
me
hurry
said
adam
in
her
room
kate
stood
still
a
second
her
eyes
narrow
her
underlip
sucked
in
her
heart
almost
stopped
then
she
said
aloud
sons
have
wished
he
would
die
too
long
for
his
death
to
strike
even
the
most
tolerant
of
them
like
that
something
dreadful
has
happened
i
wonder
to
my
soul
she
waited
until
they
were
past
hartley
and
then
she
asked
suddenly
adam
what
is
the
matter
then
adam
spoke
i
am
one
of
a
pack
of
seven
poor
fools
and
every
other
girl
in
the
family
has
gone
raving
mad
so
i
thought
i
come
after
you
and
see
if
you
had
sense
or
reason
or
justice
left
in
you
what
do
you
want
of
me
she
asked
dazedly
i
want
you
to
be
fair
to
be
honest
to
do
as
you
be
done
by
you
came
to
me
when
you
were
in
trouble
he
reminded
her
kate
could
not
prevent
the
short
laugh
that
sprang
to
her
lips
nor
what
she
said
and
you
would
not
lift
a
finger
young
adam
made
his
mother
help
me
why
do
you
go
to
george
for
what
you
want
adam
lost
all
and
swore
sulphurously
i
thought
you
be
different
he
said
but
i
see
you
are
going
to
be
just
like
the
rest
of
the
stop
that
said
kate
you
talking
about
my
sisters
and
yours
stop
this
wild
talk
and
tell
me
exactly
what
is
the
matter
i
telling
nothing
said
adam
you
can
find
out
what
is
the
matter
and
go
it
with
the
rest
of
them
when
you
get
there
mother
said
this
morning
she
wished
you
were
there
because
you
be
the
only
sane
one
in
the
family
so
i
thought
i
bring
you
but
i
wish
now
i
had
done
it
for
it
stands
to
reason
that
you
will
join
the
pack
and
run
as
fast
as
the
rest
of
the
wolves
from
a
prairie
fire
or
to
a
carcass
asked
kate
i
told
you
you
could
find
out
when
you
got
there
i
not
going
to
have
them
saying
i
influenced
you
or
bribed
you
he
said
do
you
really
think
that
they
think
you
could
adam
asked
kate
wonderingly
i
have
said
all
i
going
to
say
said
adam
and
then
he
began
driving
his
horse
inhumanely
fast
for
the
heat
was
deep
slow
and
burning
adam
is
there
any
such
hurry
asked
kate
you
know
you
are
abusing
your
horse
dreadfully
adam
immediately
jerked
the
horse
with
all
his
might
and
slashed
the
length
of
its
body
with
two
long
stripes
that
rapidly
raised
in
high
welts
so
kate
saw
that
he
was
past
reasoning
with
and
said
no
other
word
she
tried
to
think
who
would
be
at
home
how
they
would
treat
her
the
prodigal
who
had
not
been
there
in
seven
years
and
suddenly
it
occurred
to
kate
that
if
she
had
known
all
she
now
knew
in
her
youth
and
had
the
same
decision
to
make
again
as
when
she
knew
nothing
she
would
have
taken
wing
just
as
she
had
she
had
made
failures
she
had
hurt
herself
mind
and
body
but
her
honour
her
were
intact
suddenly
she
sat
straight
she
was
glad
that
she
had
taken
a
bath
worn
a
reasonably
decent
dress
and
had
a
better
one
in
the
back
of
the
buggy
she
would
cut
the
gordian
knot
with
a
vengeance
she
would
not
wait
to
see
how
they
treated
her
she
would
treat
them
as
for
adam
state
there
was
only
one
surmise
she
could
make
and
that
seemed
so
incredible
she
decided
to
wait
until
her
mother
told
her
all
about
whatever
the
trouble
was
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
house
queer
feelings
took
possession
of
kate
she
struggled
to
think
kindly
of
her
father
she
tried
to
feel
pangs
of
grief
over
his
passing
she
was
too
forthright
and
had
too
good
memory
to
succeed
home
had
been
so
unbearable
that
she
had
taken
desperate
measures
to
escape
it
but
as
the
white
house
with
its
tree
and
shrub
filled
yard
could
be
seen
more
plainly
kate
suddenly
was
filled
with
the
strongest
possessive
feeling
she
ever
had
known
it
was
home
it
was
her
home
her
place
was
there
even
as
adam
had
said
she
felt
a
sudden
revulsion
against
herself
that
she
had
stayed
away
seven
years
she
should
have
taken
her
chances
and
at
least
gone
to
see
her
mother
she
leaned
from
the
buggy
and
watched
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
tall
gaunt
dark
woman
who
had
brought
their
big
brood
into
the
world
and
stood
squarely
with
her
husband
against
every
one
of
them
in
each
thing
he
proposed
now
he
was
gone
no
doubt
he
had
carried
out
his
intentions
no
doubt
she
was
standing
by
him
as
always
kate
gathered
her
skirts
but
adam
passed
the
house
driving
furiously
as
ever
and
he
only
slackened
speed
when
he
was
forced
to
at
the
turn
from
the
road
to
the
lane
he
stopped
the
buggy
in
the
barnyard
got
out
and
began
unharnessing
the
horse
kate
sat
still
and
watched
him
until
he
led
it
away
then
she
stepped
down
and
started
across
the
barnyard
down
the
lane
leading
to
the
dooryard
as
she
closed
the
yard
gate
and
rounded
a
widely
spreading
snowball
bush
her
heart
was
pounding
wildly
what
was
coming
how
would
the
other
boys
act
if
adam
the
best
balanced
man
of
them
all
was
behaving
as
he
was
how
would
her
mother
greet
her
with
the
thought
kate
realized
that
she
was
so
homesick
for
her
mother
that
she
would
do
or
give
anything
in
the
world
to
see
her
then
there
was
a
dragging
step
a
short
sharp
breath
and
wheeling
kate
stood
facing
her
mother
she
had
come
from
the
potato
patch
back
of
the
orchard
carrying
a
pail
of
potatoes
in
each
hand
her
face
was
haggard
her
eyes
bloodshot
her
hair
falling
in
dark
tags
her
cheeks
red
with
exertion
they
stood
facing
each
other
at
the
first
glimpse
kate
cried
oh
mother
and
sprang
toward
her
then
she
stopped
while
her
heart
again
failed
her
for
from
the
astonishment
on
her
mother
face
kate
saw
instantly
that
she
was
surprised
and
had
neither
sent
for
nor
expected
her
she
was
nauseatingly
disappointed
adam
had
said
she
was
wanted
had
been
sent
for
kate
face
was
twitching
her
lips
quivering
but
she
did
not
hesitate
more
than
an
instant
i
see
you
were
not
expecting
me
she
said
i
sorry
adam
came
after
me
i
would
have
come
if
he
had
said
you
sent
for
me
kate
paused
a
minute
hopefully
her
mother
looked
at
her
steadily
i
sorry
kate
repeated
i
do
know
why
he
said
that
by
that
time
the
pain
in
her
heart
was
so
fierce
she
caught
her
breath
sharply
and
pressed
her
hand
hard
against
her
side
her
mother
stooped
set
down
the
buckets
and
taking
off
her
sunbonnet
wiped
the
sweat
from
her
lined
face
with
the
curtain
well
i
do
she
said
tersely
why
demanded
kate
to
see
if
he
could
use
you
to
serve
his
own
interests
of
course
answered
her
mother
he
lied
good
and
hard
when
he
said
i
sent
for
you
i
did
i
probably
would
the
sense
to
do
it
but
since
you
are
here
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
never
was
so
glad
to
see
any
one
in
all
my
born
days
bates
drew
herself
full
height
set
her
lips
stiffened
her
jaw
and
again
used
the
bonnet
skirt
on
her
face
and
neck
kate
picked
up
the
potatoes
to
hide
the
big
tears
that
gushed
from
her
eyes
and
leading
the
way
toward
the
house
she
said
come
over
here
in
the
shade
why
should
you
be
out
digging
potatoes
oh
they
enough
here
and
willing
enough
said
bates
slipped
off
to
get
away
from
them
it
was
the
quietest
and
the
peacefullest
out
there
kate
i
most
liked
to
stay
all
day
but
it
getting
on
to
dinner
time
and
i
short
of
potatoes
never
mind
the
potatoes
said
kate
let
the
folks
serve
themselves
if
they
are
hungry
she
went
to
the
side
of
the
smoke
house
picked
up
a
bench
turned
up
there
and
carrying
it
to
the
shady
side
of
a
widely
spreading
privet
bush
she
placed
it
where
it
would
be
best
screened
from
both
house
and
barn
then
setting
the
potatoes
in
the
shade
she
went
to
her
mother
put
her
arm
around
her
and
drew
her
to
the
seat
she
took
her
handkerchief
and
wiped
her
face
smoothed
back
her
straggled
hair
and
pulling
out
a
pin
fastened
the
coil
better
now
rest
a
bit
she
said
and
then
tell
me
why
you
are
glad
to
see
me
and
exactly
what
you
like
me
to
do
here

years

adam
told
me
not
a
word
except
that
father

gone
humph

mark

commented
bates
dryly
they
all
said

to
fill
you
up
and
get
you
on
his
side
mother
what

the
trouble
asked
kate

your
time
and
tell
me
what
has
happened
and
what
you
want

what
adam
wants
bates
relaxed
her
body
a
trifle
but
gripped
her
hands
tightly
together
in
her
lap
well
it
was
quick
work
she
said
it

between
the
blankets
where
he
thrown
them
back
to
get
out
of
the
bed
i
dunno
why
he
fooled
with
the
lamp
it
always
stood
on
the
little
table
in
his
reach
but
it
was
light
enough
to
read
fine
print
all
i
can
figure
is
that
the
light
was
going
out
of
his
eyes
an
he
thought
it
was
gettin
dark
so
he
tried
to
light
the
lamp
to
see
the
deeds
he
was
fingerin
them
when
i
left
but
he
did
say
he
could
see
them
the
lamp
was
just
on
the
bare
edge
of
the
table
the
wick
way
up
an
blackened
the
chimney
smashed
on
the
floor
the
bed
afire
those
deeds
are
burned
gasped
kate
all
of
them
are
they
all
gone
every
last
one
said
bates
well
if
one
is
gone
thank
god
they
all
are
said
kate
her
mother
turned
swiftly
and
caught
her
arm
say
that
again
she
cried
eagerly
maybe
i
wrong
about
it
but
it
what
i
think
said
kate
if
the
boys
are
crazy
over
all
of
them
being
gone
they
do
murder
if
part
had
theirs
and
the
others
had
not
bates
doubled
over
on
kate
shoulder
suddenly
and
struggled
with
an
inward
spasm
you
poor
thing
said
kate
this
is
dreadful
all
of
us
know
how
you
loved
him
how
you
worked
together
can
you
think
of
anything
i
can
do
is
there
any
special
thing
the
matter
i
afraid
whispered
bates
oh
katie
i
so
afraid
you
know
how
set
he
was
you
know
how
he
worked
himself
and
all
of
us
he
had
to
know
what
he
was
doing
when
he
fought
the
fire
till
the
shirt
burned
off
him
her
voice
dropped
to
a
harsh
whisper
what
do
you
he
doing
now
any
form
of
religious
belief
was
a
subject
that
never
had
been
touched
upon
or
talked
of
in
the
bates
family
money
was
their
god
work
their
religion
kate
looked
at
her
mother
curiously
you
mean
you
believe
in
after
life
she
asked
why
i
suppose
there
must
be
something
she
said
i
think
so
myself
said
kate
i
always
have
i
think
there
is
a
god
and
that
father
is
facing
him
now
and
finding
out
for
the
first
time
in
his
experience
that
he
is
very
small
potatoes
and
what
he
planned
and
slaved
for
amounted
to
nothing
in
the
scheme
of
the
universe
i
ca
imagine
father
being
subdued
by
anything
on
earth
but
it
appeals
to
me
that
he
will
cut
a
pathetic
figure
before
the
throne
of
an
almighty
god
a
slow
grin
twisted
bates
lips
well
wherever
he
went
she
said
i
guess
he
found
out
pretty
quick
that
he
was
some
place
at
last
where
he
could
be
boss
i
very
sure
he
has
said
kate
and
i
am
equally
sure
the
discipline
will
be
good
for
him
but
his
sons
his
precious
sons
what
are
they
doing
taking
it
according
to
their
bent
said
bates
adam
is
insane
hiram
is
crying
have
you
had
a
lawyer
asked
kate
what
for
we
all
know
the
law
on
this
subject
better
than
we
know
our
a
b
c
did
your
deed
for
this
place
go
too
asked
kate
yes
said
bates
but
mine
was
recorded
none
of
the
others
were
i
get
a
third
and
the
rest
will
be
cut
up
and
divided
share
and
share
alike
among
all
of
you
equally
i
think
it
going
to
kill
adam
and
ruin
andrew
it
wo
do
either
but
this
is
awful
i
can
see
how
the
boys
feel
and
really
mother
this
is
no
more
fair
to
them
than
things
always
have
been
for
the
girls
by
the
way
what
are
they
doing
same
as
the
boys
acting
out
their
natures
mary
is
openly
rejoicing
so
is
nancy
ellen
hannah
and
bertha
at
least
can
see
the
boys
side
the
others
say
one
thing
before
the
boys
and
another
among
themselves
in
the
end
the
girls
will
have
their
shares
and
nobody
can
blame
them
i
do
myself
but
i
think
pa
will
rise
from
his
grave
when
those
farms
are
torn
up
do
worry
said
kate
he
will
have
learned
by
now
that
graves
are
merely
incidental
and
that
he
has
no
option
on
real
estate
where
he
is
leave
him
to
his
harp
and
tell
me
what
you
want
done
i
want
you
to
see
that
it
was
all
accidental
i
want
you
to
take
care
of
me
i
want
you
should
think
out
the
fair
thing
for
all
of
us
to
do
i
want
you
to
keep
sane
and
and
shame
the
others
into
behaving
themselves
and
i
want
you
to
smash
down
hard
on
their
everlasting
did
you
do
this
and
did
you
do
that
i
reckon
i
been
told
five
hundred
times
that
i
him
the
deeds
josie
say
it
an
then
she
sings
it
not
give
them
to
him
how
could
i
help
giving
them
to
him
he
up
and
got
them
himself
if
i
had
you
have
cut
out
something
of
a
job
for
me
said
kate
but
i
do
my
best
anyway
i
can
take
care
of
you
come
on
into
the
house
now
and
let
me
clean
you
up
and
then
i
talk
the
rest
of
them
into
reason
if
you
stand
back
of
me
and
let
them
see
i
acting
for
you
you
go
ahead
said
bates
i
back
whatever
you
say
but
keep
them
off
of
me
keep
them
off
of
me
after
kate
had
bathed
her
mother
helped
her
into
fresh
clothes
and
brushed
her
hair
she
coaxed
her
to
lie
down
and
by
diplomatic
talk
and
stroking
her
head
finally
soothed
her
to
sleep
then
she
went
down
and
announced
the
fact
asked
them
all
to
be
quiet
and
began
making
her
way
from
group
to
group
in
an
effort
to
restore
mental
balance
and
sanity
after
kate
had
invited
all
of
them
to
go
home
and
stay
until
time
for
the
funeral
sunday
morning
and
all
of
them
had
emphatically
declined
and
eagerly
had
gone
on
straining
the
situation
to
the
breaking
point
kate
gave
up
and
began
setting
the
table
when
any
of
them
tried
to
talk
or
argue
with
her
she
said
conclusively
i
shall
not
say
one
word
about
this
until
monday
then
we
will
talk
things
over
and
find
where
we
stand
and
what
mother
wants
this
would
be
much
easier
for
all
of
us
if
you
all
go
home
and
calm
down
and
plan
out
what
you
think
would
be
the
fair
and
just
thing
to
do
before
evening
kate
was
back
exactly
where
she
left
off
for
when
bates
came
downstairs
her
nerves
quieted
by
her
long
sleep
she
asked
kate
what
would
be
best
about
each
question
that
arose
while
kate
answered
as
nearly
for
all
of
them
as
her
judgment
and
common
sense
dictated
but
she
gave
the
answer
in
her
own
way
and
she
paved
the
way
by
making
a
short
sharp
speech
when
the
first
person
said
in
her
hearing
that
mother
never
should
have
given
him
the
deeds
not
one
of
them
said
that
again
while
at
kate
suggestion
mentally
and
on
scraps
of
paper
every
single
one
of
them
figured
that
one
third
of
sixteen
hundred
and
fifty
was
five
hundred
and
fifty
subtracted
from
sixteen
hundred
and
fifty
this
left
one
thousand
one
hundred
which
divided
by
sixteen
gave
and
three
fourths
this
result
gave
josie
the
hysterics
strong
and
capable
though
she
was
made
hiram
violently
ill
so
that
he
resorted
to
garden
palings
for
a
support
while
agatha
used
her
influence
suddenly
and
took
adam
home
as
she
came
to
kate
to
say
that
they
were
going
agatha
was
white
as
possible
her
thin
lips
compressed
a
red
spot
burning
on
either
cheek
adam
and
i
shall
take
our
departure
now
katherine
she
said
standing
very
stiffly
her
head
held
higher
than
kate
ever
had
thought
it
could
be
lifted
kate
put
her
arm
around
her
and
gave
her
a
hearty
hug
tell
adam
i
do
what
i
think
is
fair
and
just
and
use
all
the
influence
i
have
to
get
the
others
to
do
the
same
she
said
fruitless
said
agatha
fruitless
reason
and
justice
have
departed
from
this
abode
i
shall
hasten
my
pace
and
take
adam
where
my
influence
is
paramount
the
state
of
affairs
here
is
deplorable
perfectly
deplorable
i
shall
not
be
missed
and
i
shall
leave
my
male
offspring
to
take
the
place
of
his
poor
defrauded
father
adam
was
now
a
tall
handsome
young
man
of
quite
as
fond
of
kate
as
ever
he
wiped
the
dishes
and
when
the
evening
work
was
finished
they
talked
with
bates
until
they
knew
her
every
wish
the
children
had
planned
for
a
funeral
from
the
church
because
it
was
large
enough
to
seat
the
family
and
friends
in
comfort
but
when
they
mentioned
this
to
bates
she
delivered
an
ultimatum
on
the
instant
you
do
no
such
thing
she
cried
pa
never
went
to
that
church
living
i
not
sanction
his
being
carried
there
feet
first
when
he
helpless
and
we
not
scandalize
the
neighbours
by
fighting
over
money
on
sunday
either
you
all
come
monday
morning
if
you
want
anything
to
say
about
this
if
you
do
i
put
through
the
business
in
short
order
i
sick
to
my
soul
of
the
whole
thing
wash
my
hands
of
it
as
quick
as
possible
so
the
families
all
went
to
their
homes
kate
helped
her
mother
to
bed
and
then
she
and
adam
tried
to
plan
what
would
be
best
for
the
morrow
afterward
they
sat
down
and
figured
until
almost
dawn
there
no
faintest
possibility
of
pleasing
everyone
said
kate
the
level
best
we
can
do
is
to
devise
some
scheme
whereby
everyone
will
come
as
nearly
being
satisfied
as
possible
can
aunt
josie
and
aunt
mary
keep
from
fighting
across
the
grave
asked
adam
only
heaven
knows

chapter
xvii
the
banner
hand
sunday
morning
kate
arose
early
and
had
the
house
clean
and
everything
ready
when
the
first
carriage
load
drove
into
the
barnyard
as
she
helped
her
mother
to
dress
bates
again
evidenced
a
rebellious
spirit
nancy
ellen
had
slipped
upstairs
and
sewed
fine
white
ruching
in
the
neck
and
sleeves
of
her
mother
best
dress
her
only
dress
in
fact
aside
from
the
calicoes
she
worked
in
kate
combed
her
hair
and
drew
it
in
loose
waves
across
her
temples
as
she
produced
the
dress
bates
drew
back
what
did
you
stick
them
onto
my
dress
for
she
demanded
i
did
said
kate
oh
it
was
nancy
ellen
well
i
do
see
why
she
wanted
to
make
a
laughing
stock
of
me
said
bates
she
did
said
kate
everyone
is
wearing
ruching
now
she
wanted
her
mother
to
have
what
the
best
of
them
have
humph
said
bates
well
i
reckon
i
can
stand
it
until
noon
but
it
going
to
be
a
hot
dose
have
you
a
thin
black
dress
mother
asked
kate
no
said
bates
i
have
but
you
can
make
a
pretty
safe
bet
that
i
will
have
one
before
i
start
anywhere
again
in
such
weather
as
this
that
the
proper
spirit
said
kate
there
comes
andrew
let
me
put
your
bonnet
on
she
set
the
fine
black
bonnet
nancy
ellen
had
bought
on
head
at
the
proper
angle
and
tied
the
long
wide
silk
ribbon
beneath
her
chin
bates
sat
in
resignation
kate
was
pleased
with
her
mother
appearance
look
in
the
mirror
she
said
see
what
a
handsome
lady
you
are
i
ai
seen
in
a
since
i
do
know
when
said
bates
why
should
i
begin
now
chances
are
you
have
rigged
me
up
until
i
set
the
neighbours
laughing
or
else
to
saying
that
i
wait
until
the
breath
was
out
of
pa
body
to
begin
primping
nonsense
mother
said
kate
nobody
will
say
or
think
anything
everyone
will
recognize
nancy
ellen
fine
spencerian
hand
in
that
bonnet
and
ruching
now
for
your
veil
bates
arose
from
her
chair
and
stepped
back
there
there
katie
she
said
you
gone
far
enough
i
be
sweat
to
a
lather
in
this
dress
i
wear
the
because
i
go
to
or
set
the
neighbours
talkin
how
mean
pa
was
not
to
let
me
have
a
bonnet
and
between
the
two
i
rather
they
take
it
out
on
me
than
on
him
she
steadied
herself
by
the
chair
back
and
looked
kate
in
the
eyes
pa
was
always
the
banner
hand
to
boss
everything
she
said
he
was
so
big
and
strong
and
so
sure
he
was
right
i
never
contraried
him
in
the
start
so
before
i
knowed
it
i
was
waiting
for
him
to
say
what
to
do
and
then
agreeing
with
him
even
when
i
knowed
he
was
wrong
so
goin
we
got
along
fine
but
it
give
me
an
awful
smothered
feeling
at
times
kate
stood
looking
at
her
mother
intently
her
brain
racing
for
she
was
thinking
to
herself
good
lord
she
means
that
to
preserve
the
appearance
of
she
systematically
agreed
with
him
whether
she
thought
he
was
right
or
wrong
because
she
was
not
able
to
hold
her
own
against
him
nearly
fifty
years
of
life
like
that
kate
tossed
the
heavy
black
crepe
veil
back
on
the
bed
mother
she
said
here
alone
and
between
us
if
i
promise
never
to
tell
a
living
soul
will
you
tell
me
the
truth
about
that
deed
business
bates
seemed
so
agitated
kate
added
i
mean
how
it
started
if
you
thought
it
was
right
and
a
fair
thing
to
do
yes
i
tell
you
that
said
bates
it
was
not
fair
and
i
saw
it
i
saw
it
good
and
plenty
there
was
no
use
to
fight
him
that
would
only
him
to
record
them
but
i
was
sick
of
it
an
i
told
him
so
kate
was
pinning
her
hat
i
have
planned
for
you
to
walk
with
adam
she
said
well
you
can
just
change
that
plan
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
said
bates
with
finality
i
ai
with
adam
somebody
had
told
him
about
the
deeds
before
he
got
here
he
came
in
ravin
and
he
talked
to
me
something
terrible
he
was
the
first
to
say
i
pa
the
box
not
give
it
to
him
an
he
went
farther
than
that
till
i
just
rose
up
an
called
him
down
proper
but
i
ai
good
at
him
an
i
ai
goin
with
him
i
am
goin
with
you
i
want
somebody
with
me
that
understands
me
and
feels
a
little
for
me
an
i
want
the
neighbours
to
see
that
the
minute
i
boss
such
a
fine
girl
as
you
has
her
rightful
place
in
her
home
i
go
with
you
or
sit
down
on
this
chair
and
sit
here
but
you
did
send
for
me
said
kate
no
i
had
quite
got
round
to
it
yet
but
i
was
coming
i
told
all
of
them
that
you
were
the
only
one
in
the
lot
who
had
any
sense
and
i
said
i
wished
you
were
here
and
as
i
see
it
i
for
you
yesterday
afternoon
about
three
i
was
coming
to
it
fast
i
did
feel
just
like
standing
up
for
myself
but
i
took
about
all
it
was
in
me
to
bear
just
about
three
i
for
you
katie
sure
as
god
made
little
apples
all
right
then
said
kate
but
if
you
do
tell
them
always
say
i
took
the
lead
well
they
got
to
say
something
said
bates
most
of
would
die
if
they
had
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
awhile
but
i
tell
them
fast
enough
then
she
led
the
way
downstairs
there
were
enough
members
of
the
immediate
family
to
pack
the
front
rooms
of
the
house
the
neighbours
filled
the
dining
room
and
dooryard
the
church
choir
sang
a
hymn
in
front
of
the
house
the
minister
stood
on
the
front
steps
and
read
a
chapter
and
told
where
bates
had
been
born
married
the
size
of
his
family
and
possessions
said
he
was
a
good
father
an
honest
neighbour
and
very
sensibly
left
his
future
with
his
god
then
the
choir
sang
again
and
all
started
to
their
conveyances
as
the
breaking
up
began
outside
bates
arose
and
stepped
to
the
foot
of
the
casket
she
steadied
herself
by
it
and
said
some
time
back
i
promised
pa
that
if
he
went
before
i
did
at
this
time
in
his
funeral
ceremony
i
would
set
his
black
tin
box
on
the
foot
of
his
coffin
and
unlock
before
all
of
you
and
in
the
order
in
which
they
lay
beginning
with
adam
hand
each
of
you
boys
the
deed
pa
had
made
you
for
the
land
you
live
on
you
all
know
what
happened
none
of
you
know
just
how
it
would
bring
the
deeds
back
if
you
did
they
gone
but
i
want
you
boys
to
follow
your
father
to
his
grave
with
nothing
in
your
hearts
against
him
he
was
all
for
the
men
i
do
ever
want
to
hear
any
of
you
criticize
him
about
this
or
me
either
he
did
his
best
to
make
you
upstanding
men
in
your
community
his
one
failing
being
that
he
liked
being
an
upstanding
man
himself
so
well
that
he
carried
it
too
far
but
his
intentions
was
the
best
as
for
me
i
no
idea
how
sick
he
was
and
nobody
else
did
i
minded
him
just
like
all
the
rest
of
you
always
did
the
boys
especially
from
the
church
i
want
all
of
you
to
go
home
until
morning
and
then
i
want
my
sons
and
daughters
by
birth
only
to
come
here
and
we
talk
things
over
quietly
quietly
mind
you
and
decide
what
to
do
katie
will
you
come
with
me
it
was
not
quite
a
tearless
funeral
some
of
the
wept
from
nervous
excitement
and
some
of
the
little
children
cried
with
fear
but
there
were
no
tears
from
the
wife
of
adam
bates
or
his
sons
and
daughters
and
when
he
was
left
to
the
mercies
of
time
all
of
them
followed
bates
orders
except
nancy
ellen
and
robert
who
stopped
to
help
kate
with
the
dinner
kate
slipped
into
her
second
dress
and
went
to
work
bates
untied
her
bonnet
strings
and
unfastened
her
dress
neck
as
they
started
home
she
unbuttoned
her
waist
going
up
the
back
walk
and
pulled
it
off
at
the
door
well
if
i
ever
put
that
thing
on
in
july
again
she
said
you
can
use
my
head
for
a
nancy
ellen
ca
you
stop
at
a
store
as
you
come
out
in
the
morning
and
get
the
goods
and
you
girls
run
me
up
a
dress
that
is
nice
enough
to
go
out
in
and
not
so
hot
it
starts
me
burning
before
my
time
of
course
i
can
said
nancy
ellen
about
what
do
you
want
to
pay
mother
whatever
it
takes
to
get
a
decent
and
a
cool
dress
cool
mind
you
said
bates
an
any
colour
but
black
why
mother
cried
nancy
ellen
it
must
be
black
no
said
bates
pa
kept
me
in
black
all
my
life
on
the
supposition
it
showed
the
dirt
the
least
there
nothing
in
that
it
shows
dirt
worse
white
i
got
my
fill
of
black
you
can
get
a
nice
cool
gray
if
you
want
me
to
wear
it
well
i
never
said
nancy
ellen
what
will
the
neighbours
say
what
do
i
care
asked
bates
they
talked
about
me
all
my
life
i
be
kinda
lonesome
if
they
to
quit
dinner
over
kate
proposed
that
her
mother
should
lie
down
while
they
washed
the
dishes
i
would
like
a
little
rest
said
bates
i
guess
i
go
upstairs
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
kate
it
dreadfully
hot
up
there
go
in
the
spare
room
where
it
is
cool
we
keep
quiet
i
am
going
to
stay
tuesday
until
i
move
you
in
there
anyway
it
smaller
but
it
big
enough
for
one
and
you
feel
much
better
there
oh
katie
i
so
glad
you
thought
of
that
cried
bates
i
been
thinking
and
thinking
about
it
and
it
just
seems
as
if
i
ca
ever
steel
myself
to
go
into
that
room
to
sleep
again
i
never
enter
that
door
that
i
do
see
you
never
enter
it
again
as
your
room
said
kate
i
fix
you
up
before
i
go
and
sally
whistler
told
me
last
evening
she
would
come
and
make
her
home
with
you
if
you
wanted
her
you
like
sally
you
yes
i
like
her
fine
said
bates
quietly
as
possible
the
girls
washed
the
dishes
pulled
down
the
blinds
closed
the
front
door
and
slipped
down
in
the
orchard
with
robert
to
talk
things
over
nancy
ellen
was
stiffly
reserved
with
kate
but
she
would
speak
when
she
was
spoken
to
which
was
so
much
better
than
silence
that
kate
was
happy
over
it
robert
was
himself
kate
thought
she
had
never
liked
him
so
well
he
seemed
to
grow
even
kinder
and
more
considerate
as
the
years
passed
nancy
ellen
was
prettier
than
kate
ever
had
seen
her
but
there
was
a
line
of
discontent
around
her
mouth
and
she
spoke
pettishly
on
slight
provocation
or
none
at
all
now
she
was
openly
brazenly
brutally
frank
in
her
rejoicing
she
thought
it
was
the
best
joke
that
ever
happened
to
the
boys
and
she
said
so
repeatedly
kate
found
her
lips
closing
more
tightly
and
a
slight
feeling
of
revulsion
growing
in
her
heart
surely
in
nancy
ellen
lovely
home
cared
for
and
shielded
in
every
way
she
had
no
such
need
of
money
as
kate
had
herself
she
was
delighted
when
nancy
ellen
said
she
was
sleepy
and
was
going
to
the
lounge
for
a
nap
then
kate
produced
her
sheet
of
figures
she
and
robert
talked
the
situation
over
and
carefully
figured
on
how
an
adjustment
fair
to
all
could
be
made
until
they
were
called
to
supper
after
supper
nancy
ellen
and
robert
went
home
while
kate
and
her
mother
sat
on
the
back
porch
and
talked
until
kate
had
a
clear
understanding
and
a
definite
plan
in
her
mind
which
was
that
much
improvement
over
wearing
herself
out
in
bitter
revilings
or
selfish
rejoicing
over
her
brothers
misfortune
her
mother
listened
to
all
she
had
to
say
asked
a
question
occasionally
objected
to
some
things
and
suggested
others
they
arose
when
they
had
covered
every
contingency
they
could
think
of
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
even
though
the
downstairs
was
cooler
as
she
undressed
bates
said
slowly
now
in
the
morning
speak
my
piece
first
and
i
say
it
pretty
plain
i
got
the
here
for
once
in
my
life
they
ca
rave
and
fight
here
and
insult
me
again
as
they
did
friday
night
and
saturday
till
you
got
here
an
shut
up
i
wo
stand
it
that
flat
i
tell
so
and
that
you
speak
for
me
because
you
can
figure
faster
and
express
yourself
plainer
but
insist
that
there
be
no
fussing
an
i
back
you
i
do
know
just
what
life
has
been
doing
to
you
katie
but
lord
it
has
made
a
fine
woman
of
you
kate
set
her
lips
in
an
even
line
and
said
nothing
but
her
heart
was
the
gladdest
it
had
been
in
years
her
mother
continued
seems
like
nancy
ellen
had
all
the
chance
most
folks
thought
she
was
a
lot
the
purtiest
to
start
with
though
i
say
that
i
ever
saw
so
much
difference
she
had
leisure
an
pettin
and
her
husband
has
made
a
mint
o
money
she
gone
all
over
the
country
with
him
and
the
more
chance
she
has
the
narrower
she
grows
and
the
more
discontenteder
one
thing
she
is
awful
disappointed
about
havin
no
children
i
pity
her
about
that
is
it
because
she
a
twin
asked
kate
i
afraid
so
said
bates
you
ca
tell
much
about
those
things
they
just
seem
to
happen
robert
and
nancy
ellen
feel
awful
bad
about
it
still
she
might
do
for
others
what
she
would
for
her
own
the
lord
knows
there
are
enough
mighty
nice
children
in
the
world
who
need
mothering
i
want
to
see
your
children
katie
are
they
nice
little
folks
straight
and
good
looking
the
boy
is
said
kate
the
girl
is
good
with
the
exception
of
being
the
most
stubborn
child
i
ever
seen
she
looks
so
much
like
a
woman
it
almost
sickens
me
to
think
of
that
i
have
to
drive
myself
to
do
her
justice
what
a
pity
said
bates
slowly
oh
they
are
healthy
happy
youngsters
said
kate
they
get
as
much
as
we
ever
did
and
do
expect
any
more
i
have
yet
to
see
a
demonstrative
bates
humph
said
bates
well
you
ought
to
been
here
friday
night
and
i
thought
adam
came
precious
near
it
saturday
demonstrating
power
or
anger
yes
said
kate
i
meant
affection
and
is
it
the
queerest
thing
how
people
are
made
of
all
the
boys
adam
is
the
one
who
has
had
the
most
softening
influences
and
who
has
made
the
most
money
and
yet
he
acting
the
worst
of
all
it
really
seems
as
if
failure
and
hardship
make
more
of
a
human
being
of
folks
than
success
you
right
said
bates
look
at
nancy
ellen
and
adam
sometimes
i
think
adam
has
been
pretty
much
galled
with
agatha
and
her
money
all
these
years
and
it
just
drives
him
crazy
to
think
of
having
still
less
than
she
has
have
you
got
your
figures
all
set
down
to
back
you
up
katie
yes
said
kate
i
gone
all
over
it
with
robert
and
he
thinks
it
the
best
and
only
thing
that
can
be
done
now
go
to
sleep
each
knew
that
the
other
was
awake
most
of
the
night
but
very
few
words
passed
between
them
they
were
up
early
dressed
and
waiting
when
the
first
carriage
stopped
at
the
gate
kate
told
her
mother
to
stay
where
she
would
not
be
worried
until
she
was
needed
and
went
down
herself
to
meet
her
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
big
living
room
when
the
last
one
arrived
she
called
her
mother
bates
came
down
looking
haggard
and
grim
as
none
of
her
children
ever
before
had
seen
her
she
walked
directly
to
the
little
table
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
while
still
standing
she
said
now
i
got
a
few
words
to
say
and
then
i
turn
this
over
to
a
younger
head
one
better
at
figures
than
mine
i
said
my
say
as
to
pa
yesterday
now
i
say
this
for
myself
i
got
my
start
minding
pa
and
agreeing
with
him
young
but
you
need
any
of
you
throw
it
in
my
teeth
now
that
i
did
there
is
only
one
woman
among
you
and
no
man
who
ever
disobeyed
him
katie
stood
up
to
him
once
and
got
seven
years
from
home
to
punish
her
and
me
he
was
right
then
and
i
knew
it
as
i
often
known
it
before
and
pretty
often
since
but
no
woman
god
ever
made
could
have
lived
with
adam
bates
as
his
wife
and
contraried
him
i
did
mind
him
any
quicker
or
any
oftener
than
the
rest
of
you
keep
that
pretty
clear
in
your
heads
and
do
one
of
you
dare
open
your
mouth
again
to
tell
me
as
you
did
saturday
what
i
should
and
what
i
should
i
had
the
law
of
this
explained
to
me
you
all
know
it
for
that
matter
by
the
law
i
get
this
place
and
one
third
of
all
the
other
land
and
money
i
do
know
just
what
money
there
is
at
the
bank
or
in
notes
and
mortgages
but
a
sixteenth
of
it
after
my
third
is
taken
out
ai
going
to
make
or
break
any
of
you
i
told
katie
what
i
willing
to
do
on
my
part
and
she
will
explain
it
and
then
tell
you
about
a
plan
she
has
fixed
up
as
for
me
you
can
take
it
or
leave
it
if
you
take
it
well
and
good
if
you
do
the
law
will
be
set
in
motion
and
it
will
take
its
course
to
the
end
it
all
depends
on
you
now
two
things
more
at
the
start
what
pa
wanted
to
do
seemed
to
me
right
and
i
agreed
with
him
and
worked
with
him
but
when
my
girls
began
to
grow
up
and
i
saw
how
they
felt
and
how
they
struggled
and
worked
and
how
the
women
you
boys
married
went
ahead
of
my
own
girls
and
had
finer
homes
an
carriages
and
easier
times
i
got
pretty
sick
of
it
and
i
told
pa
so
once
he
just
raved
whenever
i
did
he
always
carried
his
keys
in
his
pocket
i
never
touched
his
chest
key
in
my
life
till
i
handed
him
his
deed
box
friday
afternoon
but
i
agree
with
my
girls
it
fair
and
right
since
things
have
come
out
as
they
have
that
they
should
have
their
shares
i
would
too
the
other
thing
is
just
this
i
tired
to
death
of
the
whole
business
i
want
peace
and
rest
and
i
want
it
quick
friday
and
saturday
i
was
so
scared
and
so
knocked
out
i
i
took
it
if
one
of
the
sucking
babies
had
riz
up
and
commenced
to
tell
me
what
i
should
and
what
i
should
i
through
with
that
you
will
all
keep
civil
tongues
in
your
heads
this
morning
or
i
get
up
and
go
upstairs
an
lock
myself
in
a
room
till
you
gone
an
if
i
go
it
will
mean
that
the
law
takes
its
course
and
if
it
does
there
will
be
three
hundred
acres
less
land
to
divide
you
had
pa
on
your
hands
all
your
lives
now
you
will
go
civil
and
you
will
go
easy
or
you
will
get
a
taste
of
ma
i
take
no
more
talk
from
anybody
katie
go
ahead
with
your
figures
kate
spread
her
sheet
on
the
table
and
glanced
around
the
room
the
milton
county
records
show
sixteen
hundred
and
fifty
acres
standing
in
father
name
she
said
of
these
mother
is
heir
to
five
hundred
and
fifty
acres
leaving
one
thousand
one
hundred
acres
to
be
divided
among
sixteen
of
us
which
give
and
acres
to
each
this
land
is
the
finest
that
proper
fertilization
and
careful
handling
can
make
even
the
poorest
is
the
cream
of
the
country
as
compared
with
the
surrounding
farms
as
a
basis
of
estimate
i
have
taken
one
hundred
dollars
an
acre
as
a
fair
selling
figure
some
is
worth
more
some
less
but
that
is
a
good
average
this
would
make
the
share
of
each
of
us
in
cash
that
could
easily
be
realized
six
thousand
eight
hundred
and
dollars
whatever
else
is
in
mortgages
notes
and
money
can
be
collected
as
it
is
due
deposited
in
some
bank
and
when
it
is
all
in
divided
equally
among
us
after
deducting
mother
third
now
this
is
the
law
and
those
are
the
figures
but
i
shall
venture
to
say
that
none
of
us
feel
right
about
it
or
ever
will
an
emphatic
murmur
of
approval
ran
among
the
boys
mary
and
nancy
ellen
stoutly
declared
that
they
did
oh
no
you
do
said
kate
if
god
made
any
woman
of
you
so
that
she
feels
right
and
clean
in
her
conscience
about
this
deal
he
made
her
wrong
and
that
is
a
thing
that
has
not
yet
been
proven
of
god
as
i
see
it
here
is
the
boys
side
from
childhood
they
were
told
bribed
and
urged
to
miss
holidays
work
all
week
and
often
on
sunday
to
push
and
slave
on
the
promise
of
this
land
at
they
all
got
the
land
and
money
to
stock
it
and
build
homes
they
were
told
it
was
theirs
required
to
pay
the
taxes
on
it
and
also
to
labour
at
any
time
and
without
wages
for
father
not
one
of
the
boys
but
has
done
several
hundred
dollars
worth
of
work
on
father
farm
for
nothing
to
keep
him
satisfied
and
to
insure
getting
his
deed
all
these
years
each
man
has
paid
his
taxes
put
thousands
in
improvements
in
rebuilding
homes
and
barns
fertilizing
and
developing
his
land
each
one
of
these
farms
is
worth
nearly
twice
what
it
was
the
day
it
was
received
that
the
boys
should
lose
all
this
is
no
cause
for
rejoicing
on
the
part
of
any
true
woman
as
a
fact
no
true
woman
would
allow
such
a
thing
to
happen
speak
for
yourself
cried
several
of
the
girls
at
once
now
right
here
is
where
we
come
to
a
perfect
understanding
said
kate
i
did
say
that
for
myself
but
in
the
main
what
i
say
i
say
for
mother
now
you
will
not
one
of
you
interrupt
me
again
or
this
meeting
closes
and
each
of
you
stands
to
lose
more
than
two
thousand
dollars
which
is
worth
being
civil
for
for
quite
a
while
no
more
of
that
i
say
any
woman
should
be
ashamed
to
take
advantage
of
her
brother
through
an
accident
and
rob
him
of
years
of
work
and
money
he
was
perfectly
justified
in
thinking
was
his
i
for
one
refuse
to
do
it
and
i
want
and
need
money
probably
more
than
any
of
you
to
tear
up
these
farms
to
take
more
than
half
from
the
boys
is
too
much
on
the
other
hand
for
the
girls
to
help
earn
the
land
to
go
with
no
inheritance
at
all
is
even
more
unfair
now
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
compromise
that
will
leave
each
boy
his
farm
and
give
each
girl
the
nearest
possible
to
a
fair
amount
figuring
in
what
the
boys
have
spent
in
taxes
and
work
for
father
and
what
each
girl
has
lost
by
not
having
her
money
to
handle
all
these
years
it
is
necessary
to
split
the
difference
between
the
time
adam
the
eldest
has
had
his
inheritance
and
hiram
the
youngest
came
into
possession
which
by
taking
from
and
adding
to
gives
a
fair
average
of
fifteen
years
now
mother
proposes
if
we
will
enter
into
an
agreement
this
morning
with
no
words
and
no
wrangling
to
settle
on
this
basis
she
will
relinquish
her
third
of
all
other
land
and
keep
only
this
home
farm
she
even
will
allow
the
fifty
lying
across
the
road
to
be
sold
and
the
money
put
into
a
general
fund
for
the
share
of
the
girls
she
will
turn
into
this
fund
all
money
from
notes
and
mortgages
and
the
sale
of
all
stock
implements
here
except
what
she
wants
to
keep
for
her
use
and
the
sum
of
three
thousand
dollars
in
cash
to
provide
against
old
age
this
releases
quite
a
sum
of
money
and
three
hundred
and
fifty
acres
of
land
which
she
gives
to
the
boys
to
start
this
fund
as
her
recompense
for
their
work
and
loss
through
a
scheme
in
which
she
had
a
share
in
the
start
she
does
this
only
on
the
understanding
that
the
boys
form
a
pool
and
in
some
way
take
from
what
they
have
saved
sell
timber
or
cattle
or
borrow
enough
money
to
add
to
this
sufficient
to
pay
to
each
girl
six
thousand
dollars
in
cash
in
three
months
now
get
out
your
pencils
and
figure
start
with
the
original
number
of
acres
at
fifty
dollars
an
acre
which
is
what
it
cost
father
on
an
average
balance
against
each
other
what
the
boys
have
lost
in
tax
and
work
and
the
girls
have
lost
in
not
having
their
money
to
handle
and
cross
it
off
then
figure
not
on
a
basis
of
what
the
boys
have
made
this
land
worth
but
on
what
it
cost
father
estate
to
buy
build
on
and
stock
each
farm
strike
the
average
on
prices
and
profits
figure
that
the
girls
get
all
their
money
practically
immediately
to
pay
for
the
time
they
have
been
out
of
it
while
each
boy
assumes
an
equal
share
of
the
indebtedness
required
to
finish
out
the
six
thousand
after
mother
has
turned
in
what
she
is
willing
to
if
this
is
settled
here
and
now
then
i
understand
said
mary
that
if
we
take
under
the
law
each
of
us
is
entitled
to
and
three
quarter
acres
and
if
we
take
under
mother
proposition
we
are
entitled
to
and
a
half
acres
no
no
said
kate
the
old
nickname
for
exceptional
ability
slipping
out
before
she
thought
no
no
not
so
you
take
and
three
quarters
under
the
law
mother
proposition
is
made
only
to
the
boys
and
only
on
condition
that
they
settle
here
and
now
because
she
feels
responsible
to
them
for
her
share
in
rearing
them
and
starting
them
out
as
she
did
by
accepting
her
proposition
you
lose
eight
hundred
and
dollars
approximately
the
boys
lose
on
the
same
basis
figuring
at
fifty
dollars
and
acre
six
thousand
five
hundred
and
dollars
and
fifty
cents
plus
their
work
and
taxes
and
minus
what
mother
will
turn
in
which
will
be
about
let
me
see
it
will
take
a
pool
of
thousand
dollars
to
pay
each
of
us
six
thousand
if
mother
raises
thousand
plus
sale
money
and
notes
it
will
leave
about
nineteen
thousand
for
the
boys
which
will
divide
up
at
nearly
two
thousand
five
hundred
for
them
to
lose
as
against
less
than
a
thousand
for
us
that
should
be
enough
to
square
matters
with
any
woman
even
in
our
positions
it
will
give
us
that
much
cash
in
hand
it
will
leave
the
boys
some
of
the
younger
ones
in
debt
for
years
if
they
hold
their
land
what
more
do
you
want
i
want
the
last
cent
that
is
coming
to
me
said
mary
i
thought
you
would
said
kate
yet
you
have
the
best
home
and
the
most
money
of
any
of
the
girls
living
on
farms
i
settle
under
this
proposition
because
it
is
fair
and
just
and
what
mother
wants
done
if
she
feels
that
this
is
defrauding
the
girls
any
she
can
arrange
to
leave
what
she
has
to
us
at
her
death
which
would
more
than
square
matters
in
our
favour
you
hold
on
there
katie
said
bates
you
going
too
fast
i
get
what
coming
to
me
and
hang
on
to
it
awhile
before
i
decide
which
way
the
cat
jumps
i
reckon
you
all
admit
that
in
mothering
the
sixteen
of
you
doing
my
share
indoors
and
out
and
living
with
pa
for
all
these
years
i
earned
it
i
not
tie
myself
up
in
any
way
i
do
just
what
i
please
with
mine
figure
in
all
i
told
you
to
for
the
rest
let
be
i
beg
your
pardon
said
kate
you
right
of
course
i
sign
this
and
i
shall
expect
every
sister
i
have
to
do
the
same
quickly
and
cheerfully
as
the
best
way
out
of
a
bad
business
that
has
hurt
all
of
us
for
years
and
then
i
shall
expect
the
boys
to
follow
like
men
it
the
fairest
decentest
thing
we
can
do
let
get
it
over
kate
picked
up
the
pen
handed
it
to
her
mother
signed
afterward
herself
and
then
carried
it
to
each
of
her
sisters
leaving
nancy
ellen
and
mary
until
last
all
of
them
signed
up
to
nancy
ellen
she
hesitated
and
she
whispered
to
kate
did
robert
kate
nodded
nancy
ellen
thought
deeply
a
minute
and
then
said
slowly
i
guess
it
is
the
quickest
and
best
we
can
do
so
she
signed
mary
hesitated
longer
but
finally
added
her
name
kate
passed
on
to
the
boys
beginning
with
adam
slowly
he
wrote
his
name
and
as
he
handed
back
the
paper
he
said
thank
you
kate
i
believe
it
the
sanest
thing
we
can
do
i
can
make
it
easier
than
the
younger
boys
then
help
them
said
kate
tersely
passing
on
each
boy
signed
in
turn
all
of
them
pleased
with
the
chance
it
was
so
much
better
than
they
had
hoped
that
it
was
a
great
relief
which
most
of
them
admitted
so
they
followed
adam
example
in
thanking
kate
for
all
of
them
knew
that
in
her
brain
had
originated
the
scheme
which
seemed
to
make
the
best
of
their
troubles
then
they
sat
closer
and
talked
things
over
calmly
and
dispassionately
it
was
agreed
that
adam
and
his
mother
should
drive
to
hartley
the
following
afternoon
and
arrange
for
him
to
take
out
papers
of
administration
for
her
and
start
the
adjustment
of
affairs
they
all
went
home
thinking
more
of
each
other
and
kate
especially
than
ever
before
bates
got
dinner
while
kate
and
nancy
ellen
went
to
work
on
the
cool
gray
dress
so
that
it
would
be
ready
for
the
next
afternoon
while
her
mother
was
away
kate
cleaned
the
spare
bedroom
and
moved
her
mother
possessions
into
it
she
made
it
as
convenient
and
comfortable
and
as
pretty
as
she
could
but
the
house
was
bare
to
austerity
so
that
her
attempt
at
prettifying
was
rather
a
failure
then
she
opened
the
closed
room
and
cleaned
it
after
studying
it
most
carefully
as
it
stood
the
longer
she
worked
the
stronger
became
a
conviction
that
was
slowly
working
its
way
into
her
brain
when
she
could
do
no
more
she
packed
her
telescope
installed
sally
whistler
in
her
father
room
and
rode
to
hartley
with
a
neighbour
from
there
she
took
the
wednesday
hack
for
walden
chapter
xviii
kate
takes
the
bit
in
her
teeth
the
hackman
was
obliging
for
after
delivering
the
mail
and
some
parcels
he
took
kate
to
her
home
while
she
waited
for
him
she
walked
the
ravine
bank
planning
about
the
mill
which
was
now
so
sure
that
she
might
almost
begin
work
surely
she
might
as
soon
as
she
finished
figuring
for
she
had
visited
the
court
house
in
hartley
and
found
that
george
deeds
were
legal
and
in
proper
shape
her
mind
was
filled
with
plans
which
this
time
must
succeed
as
she
approached
the
house
she
could
see
the
children
playing
in
the
yard
it
was
the
first
time
she
ever
had
been
away
from
them
she
wondered
if
they
had
missed
her
she
was
amazed
to
find
that
they
were
very
decidedly
disappointed
to
see
her
but
a
few
pertinent
questions
developed
the
reason
their
grandmother
had
come
with
her
sister
she
had
spent
her
time
teaching
them
that
their
mother
was
cold
and
hard
and
abused
them
by
not
treating
them
as
other
children
were
treated
so
far
as
kate
could
see
they
had
broken
every
rule
she
had
ever
laid
down
for
them
eaten
until
their
stomachs
were
out
of
order
and
played
in
their
better
clothing
until
it
never
would
be
nice
again
while
polly
shouted
at
her
approach
give
me
the
oranges
and
candy
i
want
to
divide
them
silly
said
kate
this
is
too
soon
i
no
money
yet
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
i
get
any
but
you
shall
each
have
an
orange
some
candy
and
new
clothing
when
i
do
now
run
see
what
big
fish
you
can
catch
satisfied
the
children
obeyed
and
ran
to
the
creek
aunt
ollie
worried
and
angered
told
adam
to
tell
his
father
that
mother
was
home
and
for
him
to
come
and
take
her
and
grandmother
to
walden
at
once
she
had
not
been
able
to
keep
holt
from
one
steady
round
of
mischief
but
she
argued
that
her
sister
could
do
less
with
her
on
guard
than
alone
so
she
had
stayed
and
done
her
best
but
she
knew
how
kate
would
be
annoyed
so
she
believed
the
best
course
was
to
leave
as
quickly
as
possible
kate
walked
into
the
house
spoke
to
both
women
and
went
to
her
room
to
change
her
clothing
before
she
had
finished
she
heard
george
voice
in
the
house
demanding
our
millionaire
lady
i
want
a
look
at
her
kate
was
very
tired
slowly
relaxing
from
intense
nerve
strain
she
was
holding
herself
in
check
about
the
children
she
took
a
tighter
grip
and
vowed
she
would
not
give
holt
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
disturbed
and
provoked
if
she
killed
herself
in
the
effort
at
she
stepped
toward
the
door
here
she
called
in
a
clear
voice
the
tone
of
which
brought
george
swiftly
what
was
he
worth
anyway
he
shouted
oh
millions
and
millions
said
kate
sweetly
at
least
i
think
so
it
was
scarcely
a
time
to
discuss
finances
in
the
face
of
that
horrible
accident
george
laughed
oh
you
a
good
one
he
cried
think
you
can
keep
a
thing
like
that
still
the
cats
and
the
dogs
and
the
chickens
of
the
whole
county
know
about
the
deeds
the
old
land
king
had
made
for
his
sons
and
how
he
got
left
on
it
served
him
right
too
we
could
here
andrew
swear
and
see
adam
beat
his
horse
clear
over
here
that
right
go
ahead
put
on
airs
tell
us
something
we
do
know
will
you
maybe
you
think
i
was
hanging
pretty
close
around
that
neighbourhood
myself
spying
cried
kate
looking
for
timber
he
sneered
and
never
in
all
my
life
have
i
seen
anything
to
beat
it
sixteen
hundred
and
fifty
acres
of
the
best
land
in
the
world
your
share
of
land
and
money
together
will
be
every
cent
of
twelve
thousand
oh
i
guess
i
know
what
you
got
up
your
sleeve
my
lady
come
on
shell
out
let
all
go
celebrate
what
did
you
bring
the
children
kate
was
rapidly
losing
patience
in
spite
of
her
resolves
myself
she
said
from
their
appearance
and
actions
goodness
knows
they
needed
me
i
have
been
to
my
father
funeral
george
not
to
a
circus
humph
said
george
and
home
for
the
first
time
in
seven
years
you
need
tell
me
it
was
the
biggest
picnic
you
ever
had
and
say
about
those
deeds
burning
up
was
that
too
grand
even
if
my
father
burned
with
them
she
asked
george
you
make
me
completely
disgusted
big
hypocrite
he
scoffed
you
know
you
tickled
silly
why
you
will
get
ten
times
as
much
as
you
would
if
those
deeds
had
burned
i
know
what
that
estate
amounts
to
i
know
what
that
land
is
worth
i
see
that
you
get
your
share
to
the
last
penny
that
can
be
wrung
out
of
it
you
bet
i
will
things
are
coming
our
way
at
last
now
we
can
build
the
mill
and
do
everything
we
planned
i
do
know
as
we
will
build
a
mill
with
your
fifteen
thousand
we
could
start
a
store
in
hartley
and
do
bigger
things
the
thing
for
you
to
do
right
now
is
to
hitch
up
and
take
aunt
ollie
and
your
mother
home
said
kate
i
talk
to
you
after
supper
and
tell
you
all
there
is
to
know
i
dusty
and
tired
now
well
you
need
try
to
fix
up
any
shenanigan
for
me
he
said
i
know
to
within
five
hundred
dollars
of
what
your
share
of
that
estate
is
worth
and
i
see
that
you
get
it
no
one
has
even
remotely
suggested
that
i
should
have
my
share
of
that
estate
said
kate
while
he
was
gone
kate
thought
intently
as
she
went
about
her
work
she
saw
exactly
what
her
position
was
and
what
she
had
to
do
their
talk
would
be
disagreeable
but
the
matter
had
to
gone
into
and
gotten
over
she
let
george
talk
as
he
would
while
she
finished
supper
and
they
ate
when
he
went
for
his
evening
work
she
helped
the
children
scale
their
fish
for
breakfast
and
as
they
worked
she
talked
to
them
sanely
sensibly
explaining
what
she
could
avoiding
what
she
could
not
she
put
them
to
bed
her
heart
almost
sickened
at
what
they
had
been
taught
and
told
kate
was
in
no
very
propitious
mood
for
her
interview
with
george
as
she
sat
on
the
front
porch
waiting
for
him
she
was
wishing
with
all
her
heart
that
she
was
back
home
with
the
children
to
remain
forever
that
of
course
was
out
of
the
question
but
she
wished
it
she
had
been
so
glad
to
be
with
her
mother
again
to
be
of
service
to
hear
a
word
of
approval
now
and
then
she
must
be
worthy
of
her
mother
opinion
she
thought
just
as
george
stepped
on
the
porch
sat
on
the
top
step
leaned
against
a
pillar
and
said
now
go
on
tell
me
all
about
it
kate
thought
intently
a
second
instead
of
beginning
with
leaving
friday
morning
i
was
at
the
court
house
in
hartley
this
morning
she
said
you
need
have
done
that
he
scoffed
i
spent
most
of
the
day
there
monday
you
bet
folks
shelled
out
the
books
when
i
told
them
who
i
was
and
what
i
was
after
i
must
say
you
folks
have
some
little
reason
to
be
high
and
mighty
you
sure
have
got
the
dough
no
wonder
the
old
man
hung
on
to
his
deeds
himself
he
was
so
far
from
a
king
all
right
all
right
you
mean
you
left
your
work
monday
and
went
to
the
court
house
in
hartley
and
told
who
you
were
and
spent
the
day
nosing
into
my
father
affairs
before
his
sons
had
done
anything
or
you
had
any
idea
what
was
to
be
done
she
demanded
oh
you
need
get
so
high
and
mighty
he
said
i
propose
to
know
just
where
i
am
about
this
i
propose
to
have
just
what
is
coming
to
me
to
you
to
the
last
penny
and
no
bates
man
will
manage
the
affair
either
suddenly
kate
leaned
forward
i
foresee
that
you
fixed
yourself
up
for
a
big
disappointment
she
said
my
mother
and
her
eldest
son
will
settle
my
father
estate
and
when
it
is
settled
i
shall
have
exactly
what
the
other
girls
have
then
if
i
still
think
it
is
wise
i
shall
at
once
go
to
work
building
the
mill
everything
must
be
shaved
to
the
last
cent
must
be
done
with
the
closest
economy
i
must
come
out
of
this
with
enough
left
to
provide
us
a
comfortable
home
do
that
from
the
first
profits
of
the
mill
he
suggested
i
no
good
at
chickens
before
they
hatched
said
kate
besides
the
first
profits
from
the
mill
as
you
very
well
know
if
you
would
ever
stop
to
think
must
go
to
pay
for
logs
to
work
on
and
there
must
always
be
a
good
balance
for
that
purpose
no
i
reserve
enough
from
my
money
to
fix
the
home
i
want
but
i
shall
wait
to
do
it
until
the
mill
is
working
so
i
can
give
all
my
attention
to
it
while
you
are
out
looking
up
timber
of
course
i
can
do
all
of
it
perfectly
well
he
said
and
it
a
man
business
you
make
me
look
like
fifty
cents
if
you
get
out
among
men
and
go
to
doing
a
thing
no
woman
in
this
part
of
the
country
ever
did
why
it
will
look
like
you
did
trust
me
i
ca
help
how
it
will
look
said
kate
this
is
my
last
and
only
dollar
if
i
lose
it
i
am
out
for
life
i
shall
take
no
risk
i
no
confidence
in
your
business
ability
and
you
know
it
it
need
not
hurt
your
pride
a
particle
to
say
that
we
are
partners
that
i
going
to
build
the
mill
while
you
going
to
bring
in
the
timber
it
the
only
way
i
shall
touch
the
proposition
i
will
give
you
two
hundred
dollars
for
the
deed
and
abstract
of
the
ravine
i
give
your
mother
eight
hundred
for
the
lot
and
house
which
is
two
hundred
more
than
it
is
worth
i
lay
away
enough
to
rebuild
and
refurnish
it
and
with
the
remainder
i
build
the
dam
bridge
and
mill
just
as
quickly
as
it
can
be
done
as
soon
as
i
get
my
money
we
buy
timber
for
the
mill
and
get
it
sawed
and
dried
this
winter
we
can
be
all
done
and
running
by
next
june
kate
how
are
you
going
to
get
all
that
land
sold
and
the
money
in
hand
to
divide
up
that
quickly
i
do
think
it
ever
can
be
done
land
is
always
sold
on
time
you
know
he
said
kate
drew
a
deep
breath
this
land
is
going
to
be
sold
she
said
most
of
the
boys
have
owned
their
farms
long
enough
to
have
enabled
them
to
buy
other
land
and
put
money
in
the
bank
they
going
to
form
a
pool
and
put
in
enough
money
to
pay
the
girls
the
share
they
have
agreed
to
take
even
if
they
have
to
borrow
it
as
some
of
the
younger
ones
will
but
the
older
ones
will
help
them
so
the
girls
are
to
have
their
money
in
cash
in
three
months
i
was
mighty
glad
of
the
arrangement
for
my
part
because
we
can
begin
at
once
on
our
plans
for
the
mill
and
how
much
do
the
girls
get
he
asked
darkly
ca
say
just
yet
said
kate
the
notes
and
mortgages
have
to
be
gone
over
and
the
thing
figured
out
it
will
take
some
time
mother
and
adam
began
yesterday
we
shall
know
in
a
few
weeks
sounds
to
me
like
a
bates
steal
he
cried
who
figured
out
what
was
a
fair
share
for
the
girls
who
planned
that
arrangement
why
did
you
insist
on
the
thing
going
through
court
the
land
belong
sold
and
equal
divisions
of
all
the
proceeds
now
if
you
agree
not
to
say
a
word
until
i
finish
i
show
you
the
figures
said
kate
i
tell
you
what
the
plan
is
and
why
it
was
made
and
i
tell
you
further
that
it
is
already
recorded
and
in
action
there
are
no
minor
heirs
we
could
make
an
agreement
and
record
it
there
was
no
will
mother
will
administer
it
all
settled
wait
until
i
get
the
figures
then
slowly
and
clearly
she
went
over
the
situation
explaining
everything
in
detail
when
she
finished
he
sat
staring
at
her
with
a
snarling
face
you
signed
that
he
demanded
you
signed
that
you
threw
away
at
least
half
you
might
have
had
you
let
those
lazy
scoundrels
of
brothers
of
yours
hoodwink
you
and
pull
the
wool
over
your
eyes
like
that
are
you
mad
are
you
stark
staring
mad
no
i
quite
sane
said
kate
it
is
you
who
are
mad
you
know
my
figures
do
you
those
were
the
only
ones
used
yesterday
the
whole
scheme
was
mine
with
help
from
mother
to
the
extent
of
her
giving
up
everything
except
the
home
farm
you
crazy
fool
he
cried
springing
up
now
stop
said
kate
stop
right
there
i
done
what
i
think
is
right
and
fair
and
just
and
i
happy
with
the
results
act
decently
i
stay
and
build
the
mill
say
one
only
one
more
of
the
nasty
insulting
things
in
your
head
and
i
go
in
there
and
wake
up
the
children
and
we
will
leave
now
and
on
foot
confronted
with
kate
and
her
ultimatum
george
arose
and
walked
down
to
the
road
he
began
pacing
back
and
forth
in
the
moonlight
struggling
to
regain
command
of
himself
he
had
no
money
he
had
no
prospect
of
any
until
aunt
ollie
died
and
left
him
her
farm
he
was
as
he
expressed
it
up
against
it
there
now
he
was
up
against
it
with
kate
what
she
decided
upon
and
proposed
to
do
was
all
he
could
do
she
might
shave
prices
and
cut
and
skimp
and
haggle
to
buy
material
and
put
up
her
building
at
the
least
possible
expense
she
might
sit
over
books
and
figure
herself
blind
he
would
be
driving
over
the
country
visiting
with
the
farmers
booming
himself
for
a
fat
county
office
maybe
eating
big
dinners
and
being
a
jolly
good
fellow
generally
naturally
as
breathing
there
came
to
him
a
scheme
whereby
he
could
buy
at
the
very
lowest
figure
he
could
extract
then
he
would
raise
the
price
to
kate
enough
to
make
him
a
comfortable
income
besides
his
share
of
the
business
he
had
not
walked
the
road
long
until
his
anger
was
all
gone
he
began
planning
the
kind
of
horse
he
would
have
to
drive
the
buggy
he
would
want
and
a
box
in
it
to
carry
a
hatchet
a
square
measures
an
auger
other
tools
he
would
need
and
by
jove
it
would
be
a
dandy
idea
to
carry
a
bottle
of
the
real
thing
many
a
farmer
for
a
good
cigar
and
a
few
swallows
of
the
right
thing
would
warm
up
and
sign
such
a
contract
as
could
be
got
in
no
other
manner
while
he
would
need
it
on
cold
days
himself
george
stopped
in
the
moonlight
to
slap
his
leg
and
laugh
over
the
happy
thought
by
george
georgie
my
boy
he
said
most
days
will
be
cold
wo
they
he
had
no
word
to
say
to
kate
of
his
change
of
feeling
in
the
matter
he
did
not
want
to
miss
the
chance
of
twitting
her
at
every
opportunity
he
could
invent
with
having
thrown
away
half
her
inheritance
but
he
was
glad
the
whole
thing
was
settled
so
quickly
and
easily
he
was
now
busy
planning
how
he
would
spend
the
money
kate
agreed
to
pay
him
for
the
ravine
but
that
was
another
rosy
cloud
she
soon
changed
in
colour
for
she
told
him
if
he
was
going
to
be
a
partner
he
could
put
in
what
money
he
had
as
his
time
was
no
more
valuable
than
she
could
make
hers
teaching
school
again
in
other
words
he
could
buy
his
horse
and
buggy
with
the
price
she
paid
for
the
location
so
he
was
forced
to
agree
he
was
forced
to
do
a
great
many
things
in
the
following
months
that
he
hated
but
he
had
to
do
them
or
be
left
out
of
the
proposition
altogether
bates
and
adam
administered
the
bates
estate
promptly
and
efficiently
the
girls
had
their
money
on
time
the
boys
adjusted
themselves
as
their
circumstances
admitted
bates
had
to
make
so
many
trips
to
town
before
the
last
paper
was
signed
and
the
last
transfer
was
made
that
she
felt
she
could
not
go
any
farther
so
she
did
not
nancy
ellen
had
reached
the
point
where
she
would
stop
and
talk
a
few
minutes
to
kate
if
she
met
her
on
the
streets
of
hartley
as
she
frequently
did
now
but
she
would
not
ask
her
to
come
home
with
her
because
she
would
not
bring
herself
in
contact
with
george
holt
the
day
kate
went
to
hartley
to
receive
and
deposit
her
check
and
start
her
bank
account
her
mother
asked
her
if
she
had
any
plan
as
to
what
she
would
do
with
her
money
kate
told
her
in
detail
bates
listened
with
grim
face
you
better
leave
it
in
the
bank
she
said
and
use
the
interest
to
help
you
live
or
put
it
in
good
farm
mortgages
where
you
can
easily
get
ten
per
cent
kate
explained
again
and
told
how
she
was
doing
all
the
buying
how
she
would
pay
all
bills
and
keep
the
books
it
was
no
use
bates
sternly
insisted
that
she
should
do
no
such
thing
in
some
way
she
would
be
defrauded
in
some
way
she
would
lose
the
money
what
she
was
proposing
was
a
man
work
kate
had
most
of
her
contracts
signed
and
much
material
ordered
she
could
not
stop
sadly
she
saw
her
mother
turn
from
her
declaring
as
she
went
that
kate
would
lose
every
cent
she
had
and
when
she
did
she
need
not
come
hanging
around
her
she
had
been
warned
if
she
lost
she
could
take
the
consequences
for
an
instant
kate
felt
that
she
could
not
endure
it
then
she
sprang
after
her
mother
oh
but
i
wo
lose
she
cried
i
keeping
my
money
in
my
own
hands
i
spending
it
myself
please
mother
come
and
see
the
location
and
let
me
show
you
everything
too
late
now
said
bates
grimly
the
thing
is
done
the
time
to
have
told
me
was
before
you
made
any
contracts
you
always
taking
the
bit
in
your
teeth
and
going
ahead
well
go
but
remember
you
make
your
bed
so
you
can
lie
all
right
said
kate
trying
to
force
a
laugh
do
you
worry
next
time
you
get
into
a
tight
place
and
want
to
borrow
a
few
hundreds
come
to
me
bates
laughed
derisively
kate
turned
away
with
a
faint
sickness
in
her
heart
and
when
half
an
hour
later
she
met
nancy
ellen
fresh
from
an
interview
with
her
mother
she
felt
no
better
far
worse
in
fact
for
nancy
ellen
certainly
could
say
what
was
in
her
mind
with
free
and
forceful
directness
with
deft
tongue
and
nimble
brain
she
embroidered
all
bates
had
said
and
prophesied
more
evil
luck
in
three
minutes
than
her
mother
could
have
thought
of
in
a
year
kate
left
them
with
no
promise
of
seeing
either
of
them
again
except
by
accident
her
heart
and
brain
filled
with
misgivings
must
i
always
have
fly
in
my
ointment
she
wailed
to
herself
i
thought
this
morning
this
would
be
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
i
felt
as
if
i
were
flying
ye
gods
but
wings
were
never
meant
for
me
every
time
i
take
them
down
i
come
kerflop
mostly
in
a
of
dark
despair
as
the
hymn
book
says
anyway
i
keep
my
promise
and
give
the
youngsters
a
treat
so
she
bought
each
of
them
an
orange
some
candy
and
goods
for
a
new
sunday
outfit
and
comfortable
school
clothing
then
she
took
the
hack
for
walden
feeling
in
a
degree
as
she
had
the
day
she
married
george
holt
as
she
passed
the
ravine
and
again
studied
the
location
her
spirits
arose
it
was
a
good
scheme
it
would
work
she
would
work
it
she
would
sell
from
the
yards
to
walden
and
the
surrounding
country
she
would
see
the
dealers
in
hartley
and
talk
the
business
over
so
she
would
know
she
was
not
being
cheated
in
freight
rates
when
she
came
to
shipping
she
stopped
at
holt
laid
a
deed
before
her
for
her
signature
and
offered
her
a
check
for
eight
hundred
for
the
holt
house
and
lot
which
holt
eagerly
accepted
they
arranged
to
move
immediately
as
the
children
were
missing
school
she
had
a
deed
with
her
for
the
ravine
which
george
signed
in
walden
and
both
documents
were
acknowledged
but
she
would
not
give
him
the
money
until
he
had
the
horse
and
buggy
he
was
to
use
at
the
gate
in
the
spring
he
wanted
to
start
out
buying
at
once
but
that
was
going
too
far
in
the
future
for
kate
while
the
stream
was
low
and
the
banks
firm
kate
built
her
dam
so
that
it
would
be
ready
for
spring
put
in
the
abutments
and
built
the
bridge
it
was
not
a
large
dam
and
not
a
big
bridge
but
both
were
solid
well
constructed
and
would
serve
every
purpose
then
kate
set
men
hauling
stone
for
the
corner
foundations
she
hoped
to
work
up
such
a
trade
and
buy
so
much
and
so
wisely
in
the
summer
that
she
could
run
all
winter
so
she
was
building
a
real
mill
in
the
bates
way
which
way
included
letting
the
foundations
freeze
and
settle
over
winter
that
really
was
an
interesting
and
a
comfortable
winter
kate
and
george
both
watched
the
children
studies
at
night
worked
their
plans
finer
in
the
daytime
and
lived
as
cheaply
and
carefully
as
they
could
everything
was
going
well
george
was
doing
his
best
to
promote
the
mill
plan
to
keep
kate
satisfied
at
home
to
steal
out
after
she
slept
and
keep
himself
satisfied
in
appetite
and
some
ready
money
in
his
pockets
won
at
games
of
chance
at
which
he
was
an
expert
and
at
cards
which
he
handled
like
a
master
chapter
xix
as
a
man
soweth
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
in
the
spring
the
building
of
the
mill
began
it
was
scarcely
well
under
way
when
the
work
was
stopped
by
a
week
of
heavy
rains
the
water
filled
the
ravine
to
dangerous
height
and
the
roaring
of
the
dam
could
be
heard
all
over
town
george
talked
of
it
incessantly
he
said
it
was
the
sweetest
music
his
ears
had
ever
heard
kate
had
to
confess
that
she
like
the
sound
herself
but
she
was
fearful
over
saying
much
on
the
subject
because
she
was
so
very
anxious
about
the
stability
of
the
dam
there
was
a
day
or
two
of
fine
weather
then
the
rains
began
again
kate
said
she
had
all
the
music
she
desired
she
proposed
to
be
safe
so
she
went
and
opened
the
sluiceway
to
reduce
the
pressure
on
the
dam
the
result
was
almost
immediate
the
water
gushed
through
lowering
the
current
and
lessening
the
fall
george
grumbled
all
day
threatening
half
a
dozen
times
to
shut
the
sluice
but
kate
and
the
carpenter
were
against
him
so
he
waited
until
he
came
slipping
home
after
midnight
his
brain
in
a
muddle
from
drink
smoke
and
cards
as
he
neared
the
dam
he
decided
that
the
reason
he
felt
so
badly
was
because
he
had
missed
hearing
it
all
day
but
he
would
have
it
to
go
to
sleep
by
so
he
crossed
the
bridge
and
shut
the
sluice
gate
even
as
he
was
doing
it
the
thunder
pealed
lightning
flashed
and
high
heaven
gave
him
warning
that
he
was
doing
a
dangerous
thing
but
all
his
life
he
had
done
what
he
pleased
there
was
no
probability
that
he
would
change
then
he
needed
the
roar
of
the
dam
to
quiet
his
nerves
the
same
roar
that
put
him
to
sleep
awakened
kate
she
lay
wondering
at
it
and
fearing
she
raised
her
window
to
listen
the
rain
was
falling
in
torrents
while
the
roar
was
awful
so
much
worse
than
it
had
been
when
she
fell
asleep
that
she
had
a
suspicion
of
what
might
have
caused
it
she
went
to
george
room
and
shook
him
awake
listen
to
the
dam
she
cried
it
will
go
as
sure
as
fate
george
did
you
oh
did
you
close
the
when
you
came
home
he
was
half
asleep
and
too
defiant
from
drink
to
take
his
usual
course
sure
he
said
sweesish
mushich
ever
hearsh
push
me
shleep
he
fell
back
on
the
pillow
and
went
on
sleeping
kate
tried
again
to
waken
him
but
he
struck
at
her
savagely
she
ran
to
her
room
hurried
into
a
few
clothes
and
getting
the
lantern
started
toward
the
bridge
at
the
gate
she
stepped
into
water
as
far
as
she
could
see
above
the
dam
the
street
was
covered
she
waded
to
the
bridge
which
was
under
at
each
end
but
still
bare
in
the
middle
where
it
was
slightly
higher
kate
crossed
it
and
started
down
the
yard
toward
the
dam
the
earth
was
softer
there
and
she
mired
in
places
almost
to
her
knees
at
the
dam
the
water
was
tearing
around
each
end
in
a
mad
race
carrying
earth
and
everything
before
it
the
mill
side
was
lower
than
the
street
the
current
was
so
broad
and
deep
she
could
not
see
where
the
sluice
was
she
hesitated
a
second
to
try
to
locate
it
from
the
mill
behind
her
and
in
that
instant
there
was
a
crack
and
a
roar
a
mighty
rush
that
swept
her
from
her
feet
and
washed
away
the
lantern
nothing
saved
her
but
the
trees
on
the
bank
she
struck
one
clung
to
it
pulled
herself
higher
and
in
the
blackness
gripped
the
tree
while
she
heard
the
dam
going
gradually
after
the
first
break
there
was
no
use
to
scream
no
one
could
have
heard
her
the
storm
raved
on
kate
clung
to
her
tree
with
each
flash
of
lightning
trying
to
see
the
dam
at
last
she
saw
that
it
was
not
all
gone
she
was
not
much
concerned
about
herself
she
knew
the
tree
would
hold
eagerly
she
strained
her
eyes
toward
the
dam
she
could
feel
the
water
dropping
lower
while
the
roar
subsided
to
a
wild
rush
and
with
flashes
of
lightning
she
could
see
what
she
thought
was
at
least
half
of
the
dam
holding
firm
by
that
time
kate
began
to
chill
she
wrapped
her
arms
around
the
tree
and
pressing
her
cheek
against
the
rough
bark
she
cried
as
hard
as
she
could
and
did
not
care
god
would
not
hear
the
neighbours
could
not
she
shook
and
cried
until
she
was
worn
out
by
that
time
the
water
was
only
a
muddy
flow
around
her
ankles
if
she
had
a
light
she
could
wade
back
to
the
bridge
and
reach
home
but
if
she
missed
the
bridge
and
went
into
the
ravine
the
current
would
be
too
strong
for
her
she
held
with
one
arm
and
tried
to
wipe
her
face
with
the
other
hand
what
a
fool
to
cry
she
said
as
if
there
were
any
more
water
needed
here
then
she
saw
a
light
in
the
house
and
the
figures
of
the
children
carrying
it
from
room
to
room
so
she
knew
that
one
of
them
had
awakened
for
a
drink
or
with
the
storm
and
they
had
missed
her
then
she
could
see
them
at
the
front
door
adam
sturdy
feet
planted
widely
apart
bracing
him
as
he
held
up
the
lamp
which
flickered
in
the
wind
then
she
could
hear
his
voice
shouting
mother
instantly
kate
answered
then
she
was
sorry
she
had
for
both
of
them
began
to
scream
wildly
there
was
a
second
of
that
then
even
the
children
realized
its
futility
she
is
out
there
in
the
water
we
got
to
get
her
said
adam
we
got
to
do
it
he
started
with
the
light
held
high
the
wind
blew
it
out
they
had
to
go
back
to
relight
it
kate
knew
they
would
burn
their
fingers
and
she
prayed
they
would
not
set
the
house
on
fire
when
the
light
showed
again
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
she
screamed
adam
set
the
broom
on
fire
and
carry
it
to
the
end
of
the
bridge
the
water
is
deep
enough
to
hurt
you
she
tried
twice
then
she
saw
him
give
polly
the
lamp
and
run
down
the
hall
he
came
back
in
an
instant
with
the
broom
polly
held
the
lamp
high
adam
went
down
the
walk
to
the
gate
and
started
up
the
sidewalk
he
using
his
head
said
kate
to
the
tree
he
going
to
wait
until
he
reaches
the
bridge
to
start
his
light
so
it
will
last
longer
that
is
bates
anyway
thank
god
adam
scratched
several
matches
before
he
got
the
broom
well
ignited
then
he
held
it
high
and
by
its
light
found
the
end
of
the
bridge
kate
called
to
him
to
stop
and
plunging
and
splashing
through
mud
and
water
she
reached
the
bridge
before
the
broom
burned
out
there
she
clung
to
the
railing
she
had
insisted
upon
and
felt
her
way
across
to
the
boy
his
thin
cotton
night
shirt
was
plastered
to
his
sturdy
little
body
as
she
touched
him
kate
lifted
him
in
her
arms
and
almost
hugged
the
life
from
him
you
big
man
she
said
you
could
help
mother
good
for
you
is
the
dam
gone
he
asked
part
of
it
said
kate
sliding
her
feet
before
her
as
she
waded
toward
polly
in
the
doorway
did
father
shut
the
to
hear
the
roar
kate
hesitated
the
shivering
body
in
her
arms
felt
so
small
to
her
i
he
did
said
adam
all
day
he
was
fussing
after
you
stopped
the
roar
then
he
added
casually
the
old
fool
known
better
i
he
was
drunk
again
oh
adam
cried
kate
setting
him
on
the
porch
oh
adam
what
makes
you
say
that
oh
all
of
them
at
school
say
that
scoffed
adam
everybody
knows
it
but
you
do
they
polly
sure
said
polly
most
every
night
but
do
you
mind
mother
adam
and
i
will
take
care
of
you
kate
fell
on
her
knees
and
gathered
both
of
them
in
a
crushing
hug
for
an
instant
then
she
helped
them
into
to
dry
nightgowns
and
to
bed
as
she
covered
them
she
stooped
and
kissed
each
of
them
before
she
went
to
warm
and
put
on
dry
clothes
and
dry
her
hair
it
was
almost
dawn
when
she
walked
to
george
holt
door
and
looked
in
at
him
lying
stretched
in
deep
sleep
you
may
thank
your
god
for
your
children
she
said
if
it
been
for
them
i
know
what
i
would
have
done
to
you
then
she
went
to
her
room
and
lay
down
to
rest
until
dawn
she
was
up
at
the
usual
time
and
had
breakfast
ready
for
the
children
as
they
were
starting
to
school
george
came
into
the
room
mother
said
polly
there
is
a
lot
of
folks
over
around
the
dam
what
shall
we
tell
them
kate
heart
stopped
she
had
heard
that
question
before
tell
them
the
truth
said
adam
scornfully
before
kate
could
answer
tell
them
that
mother
opened
the
sluiceway
to
save
the
dam
and
father
shut
it
to
hear
it
roar
and
it
busted
shall
i
mother
asked
polly
a
slow
whiteness
spread
over
george
face
he
stared
down
the
hall
to
look
tell
them
exactly
what
you
please
said
kate
only
you
watch
yourself
like
a
hawk
if
you
tell
one
word
not
the
way
it
was
or
in
any
way
different
from
what
happened
i
punish
you
severely
may
i
tell
them
i
held
the
lamp
while
adam
got
you
out
of
the
water
asked
polly
that
would
be
true
you
know
george
turned
to
listen
his
face
still
whiter
yes
that
would
be
true
said
kate
but
if
you
tell
them
that
the
first
thing
they
will
ask
will
be
was
your
father
what
will
you
say
then
why
we
say
that
he
was
so
drunk
we
could
wake
him
up
said
polly
conclusively
we
pulled
him
an
we
shook
him
an
we
yelled
at
him
did
we
adam
i
was
not
drunk
shouted
george
oh
yes
you
were
said
adam
you
smelled
all
sour
like
it
does
at
the
saloon
door
george
made
a
rush
at
adam
the
boy
spread
his
feet
and
put
up
his
hands
but
never
flinched
or
moved
kate
looking
on
felt
something
in
her
heart
that
never
had
been
there
before
she
caught
george
arm
as
he
reached
the
child
you
go
on
to
school
little
folks
she
said
and
for
mother
sake
try
not
to
talk
at
all
if
people
question
you
tell
them
to
ask
mother
i
be
so
proud
of
you
if
you
would
do
that
i
will
if
you
hold
me
and
kiss
me
again
like
you
did
last
night
when
you
got
out
of
the
water
said
polly
it
is
a
bargain
said
kate
how
about
you
adam
i
will
for
that
too
said
adam
but
i
like
awful
well
to
tell
how
fast
the
water
went
and
how
it
poured
and
roared
while
i
held
the
light
and
you
got
across
gee
if
was
awful
mother
so
black
and
so
crashy
and
so
deep
i
like
to
tell
but
you
wo
if
i
ask
you
not
to
queried
kate
i
will
not
said
adam
kate
went
down
on
her
knees
again
she
held
out
her
arms
and
both
youngsters
rushed
to
her
after
they
were
gone
she
and
george
holt
looked
at
each
other
an
instant
then
kate
turned
to
her
work
he
followed
kate
he
began
no
use
said
kate
if
you
go
out
and
look
at
the
highest
water
mark
you
can
easily
imagine
what
i
had
to
face
last
night
when
i
had
to
cross
the
bridge
to
open
the
or
the
bridge
would
have
gone
too
if
the
children
had
not
wakened
with
the
storm
and
hunted
me
i
have
had
to
stay
over
there
until
morning
if
i
could
have
clung
to
the
tree
that
long
first
they
rescued
me
and
then
they
rescued
you
if
you
only
but
knew
it
by
using
part
of
the
money
i
had
saved
for
the
house
i
can
rebuild
the
dam
but
i
am
done
with
you
we
partners
no
longer
not
with
business
money
or
in
any
other
way
will
i
ever
trust
you
again
sit
down
there
and
eat
your
breakfast
and
then
leave
my
sight
instead
george
put
on
his
old
clothing
crossed
the
bridge
and
worked
all
day
with
all
his
might
trying
to
gather
building
material
out
of
the
water
save
debris
from
the
dam
to
clear
the
village
street
at
noon
he
came
over
and
got
a
drink
and
a
piece
of
bread
at
night
he
worked
until
he
could
see
no
longer
and
then
ate
some
food
from
the
cupboard
and
went
to
bed
he
was
up
and
at
work
before
daybreak
in
the
morning
and
for
two
weeks
he
kept
this
up
until
he
had
done
much
to
repair
the
work
of
the
storm
the
dam
he
almost
rebuilt
himself
as
soon
as
the
water
lowered
to
normal
again
kate
knew
what
he
was
trying
to
do
and
knew
also
that
in
a
month
he
had
the
village
pitying
him
and
blaming
her
because
he
was
working
himself
to
death
and
she
was
allowing
it
she
doggedly
went
on
with
her
work
the
contracts
were
made
she
was
forced
to
as
the
work
neared
completion
her
faith
in
the
enterprise
grew
she
studied
by
the
hour
everything
she
could
find
pertaining
to
the
business
when
the
machinery
began
to
arrive
george
frequently
spoke
about
having
timber
ready
to
begin
work
on
but
he
never
really
believed
the
thing
which
did
happen
would
happen
until
the
first
load
of
logs
slowly
crossed
the
bridge
and
began
unloading
in
the
yards
a
few
questions
elicited
from
the
driver
the
reply
that
he
had
sold
the
timber
to
young
adam
bates
of
bates
corners
who
was
out
buying
right
and
left
and
paying
cash
on
condition
the
seller
did
his
own
delivering
george
saw
the
scheme
and
that
it
was
good
also
the
logs
were
good
while
the
price
was
less
than
he
hoped
to
pay
for
such
timber
his
soul
was
filled
with
bitterness
the
mill
was
his
scheme
he
had
planned
it
all
those
thieving
bates
had
stolen
his
plan
and
his
location
and
his
home
and
practically
separated
him
from
his
wife
and
children
it
was
his
mill
and
all
he
was
getting
from
it
was
to
work
with
all
his
might
and
not
a
decent
word
from
morning
until
night
that
day
instead
of
working
as
before
he
sat
in
the
shade
most
of
the
time
and
that
night
instead
of
going
to
bed
he
went
down
town
when
the
mill
was
almost
finished
kate
employed
two
men
who
lived
in
walden
but
had
been
working
in
the
hartley
mills
for
years
they
were
honest
men
of
much
experience
kate
made
the
better
of
them
foreman
and
consulted
with
him
in
every
step
of
completing
the
mill
and
setting
up
the
machinery
she
watched
everything
with
sharp
eyes
often
making
suggestions
that
were
useful
about
the
placing
of
different
parts
as
a
woman
would
arrange
them
some
of
these
the
men
laughed
at
some
they
were
more
than
glad
to
accept
when
the
engine
was
set
up
the
big
saw
in
place
george
went
to
kate
see
here
he
said
roughly
i
know
i
was
wrong
about
the
i
was
a
fool
to
shut
it
with
the
water
that
high
but
i
learned
my
lesson
i
never
touch
it
again
i
worked
like
a
dog
for
weeks
to
pay
for
it
now
where
do
i
come
in
what
my
job
how
much
is
my
share
of
the
money
and
when
do
i
get
it
the
trouble
with
you
george
is
that
you
have
to
learn
a
new
lesson
about
every
thing
you
attempt
you
ca
carry
a
lesson
about
one
thing
in
your
mind
and
apply
it
to
the
next
thing
that
comes
up
i
know
you
have
worked
and
i
know
why
it
is
fair
that
you
should
have
something
but
i
ca
say
what
just
now
having
to
rebuild
the
dam
and
with
a
number
of
incidentals
that
have
come
up
in
spite
of
the
best
figuring
i
could
do
i
have
been
forced
to
use
my
money
saved
for
rebuilding
the
house
and
even
with
that
i
am
coming
out
a
hundred
or
two
short
i
strapped
and
until
money
begins
to
come
in
i
have
none
myself
the
first
must
go
toward
paying
the
men
wages
the
next
for
timber
if
jim
milton
can
find
work
for
you
go
to
work
at
the
mill
and
when
we
get
started
i
pay
you
what
is
fair
and
just
you
may
depend
on
that
if
he
has
work
for
you
you
have
to
find
a
job
at
something
else
do
you
mean
that
he
asked
wonderingly
i
mean
it
said
kate
after
stealing
my
plan
and
getting
my
land
for
nothing
you
throw
me
out
entirely
he
demanded
you
entreated
me
to
put
all
i
had
into
your
plan
you
told
me
repeatedly
the
ravine
was
worth
nothing
you
were
not
even
keeping
up
the
taxes
on
it
until
i
came
and
urged
you
to
the
dam
is
used
merely
for
water
the
engine
furnishes
the
real
power
and
if
you
are
thrown
out
you
have
thrown
yourself
out
you
have
had
every
chance
you
are
going
to
keep
your
nephew
on
the
buying
job
he
asked
i
am
said
kate
you
can
have
no
job
that
will
give
you
a
chance
to
involve
me
financially
then
give
me
milton
place
it
so
easy
a
baby
could
do
it
and
the
wages
you
have
promised
him
are
scandalous
said
george
kate
laughed
oh
george
she
said
you
ca
mean
that
of
all
your
ideas
that
you
could
operate
that
saw
is
the
wildest
oh
course
you
could
start
the
engine
and
set
the
saw
running
i
could
myself
but
to
regulate
its
speed
to
control
it
with
judgment
you
could
no
more
do
it
than
polly
as
for
wages
milton
is
working
for
less
than
he
got
in
hartley
because
he
can
be
at
home
and
save
his
hack
fare
as
you
know
george
went
over
to
jim
milton
and
after
doing
all
he
could
see
to
do
and
ordering
milton
to
do
several
things
he
thought
might
be
done
he
said
casually
of
course
i
am
boss
around
this
shack
but
this
is
new
to
me
you
fellows
will
have
to
tell
me
what
to
do
until
i
get
my
bearings
as
soon
as
we
get
to
running
i
be
and
manage
the
selling
and
shipping
i
good
at
figures
and
that
would
be
the
best
place
for
me
you
have
to
settle
with
holt
about
that
said
jim
milton
of
course
said
george
is
she
a
wonder
with
my
help
soon
wipe
the
hartley
mills
off
the
map
and
be
selling
till
grand
rapids
will
get
her
eye
peeled
with
you
to
run
the
machinery
me
to
manage
the
sales
and
her
to
keep
the
books
we
got
a
combination
to
beat
the
world
in
the
meantime
said
jim
milton
dryly
you
might
take
that
scoop
shovel
and
clean
the
shavings
and
blocks
off
this
floor
leave
me
some
before
the
engine
to
start
the
first
fire
and
shovel
the
rest
into
that
bin
there
where
it
handy
it
is
safe
to
start
with
so
much
loose
dry
stuff
lying
around
george
went
to
work
with
the
scoop
shovel
but
he
watched
every
movement
jim
milton
made
about
the
engine
and
machinery
often
he
dropped
the
shovel
and
stood
studying
things
out
for
himself
and
asking
questions
not
being
sure
of
his
position
jim
milton
answered
him
patiently
and
showed
him
all
he
wanted
to
know
but
he
constantly
cautioned
him
not
to
touch
anything
or
try
to
start
the
machinery
himself
as
he
might
lose
control
of
the
gauge
and
break
the
saw
or
let
the
power
run
away
with
him
george
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
danger
and
laughed
at
the
simplicity
of
the
engine
and
machinery
there
was
little
for
him
to
do
he
hated
to
be
seen
cleaning
up
the
debris
men
who
stopped
in
passing
kept
telling
what
a
fine
fellow
young
bates
was
what
good
timber
he
was
sending
in
several
of
them
told
george
frankly
they
thought
that
was
to
be
his
job
he
was
so
ashamed
of
that
he
began
instant
improvisation
that
was
the
way
we
first
planned
things
he
said
boastfully
but
when
it
came
to
working
out
our
plans
we
found
i
would
be
needed
here
till
i
learned
the
business
and
then
i
going
on
the
road
i
am
going
to
be
the
salesman
to
travel
dress
well
eat
well
flirt
with
the
pretty
girls
and
take
big
lumber
orders
will
just
about
suit
little
old
georgie
wonder
you
remembered
to
put
the
orders
in
at
all
said
jim
milton
dryly
george
glared
at
him
well
just
remember
whom
you
take
orders
from
he
said
pompously
i
take
them
from
holt
and
nobody
else
said
milton
with
equal
assurance
and
i
yet
to
hear
her
say
the
first
word
about
this
wonderful
travelling
proposition
she
thinks
she
will
do
well
to
fill
home
orders
and
ship
to
a
couple
of
factories
she
already
has
contracts
with
sure
you
did
dream
that
travelling
proposition
george
at
that
instant
george
wished
he
could
slay
jim
milton
all
day
he
brooded
and
grew
sullen
and
ugly
by
noon
he
quit
working
and
went
down
town
by
suppertime
he
went
home
to
prove
to
his
wife
that
he
was
all
right
she
happened
to
be
coming
across
from
the
mill
where
she
had
helped
milton
lay
the
first
fire
under
the
boiler
ready
to
touch
off
and
had
seen
the
first
log
on
the
set
carriage
it
had
been
agreed
that
she
was
to
come
over
at
opening
time
in
the
morning
and
start
the
machinery
she
was
a
proud
and
eager
woman
when
she
crossed
the
bridge
and
started
down
the
street
toward
the
gate
from
the
opposite
direction
came
george
so
unsteady
that
he
was
running
into
tree
boxes
then
lifting
his
hat
and
apologizing
to
them
for
his
awkwardness
kate
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
might
fall
any
instant
her
only
thought
was
to
help
him
from
the
street
to
where
children
would
not
see
him
she
went
to
him
and
taking
his
arm
started
down
the
walk
with
him
he
took
off
his
hat
to
her
also
and
walked
with
wavering
dignity
setting
his
steps
as
if
his
legs
were
not
long
enough
to
reach
the
walk
so
that
each
step
ended
with
a
decided
thump
kate
could
see
the
neighbours
watching
at
their
windows
and
her
own
children
playing
on
the
roof
of
the
woodshed
when
the
children
saw
their
parents
they
both
stopped
playing
to
stare
at
them
then
suddenly
shrill
and
high
arose
adam
childish
voice
father
came
home
the
other
night
tried
to
blow
out
the
light
blew
and
blew
with
all
his
might
and
the
blow
almost
killed
mother
polly
joined
him
and
they
sang
and
shrilled
and
shrieked
it
they
jumped
up
and
down
and
laughed
and
repeated
it
again
and
again
kate
guided
george
to
his
room
and
gave
him
a
shove
that
landed
him
on
his
bed
then
to
hush
the
children
she
called
them
to
supper
they
stopped
suddenly
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
kitchen
door
and
sat
sorry
and
ashamed
while
she
went
around
her
face
white
her
lips
closed
preparing
their
food
george
was
asleep
the
children
ate
alone
as
she
could
take
no
food
later
she
cleaned
the
kitchen
put
the
children
to
bed
and
sat
on
the
front
porch
looking
at
the
mill
wondering
hoping
planning
praying
unconsciously
when
she
went
to
bed
at
ten
george
was
still
asleep
he
awakened
shortly
after
burning
with
heat
and
thirst
he
arose
and
slipped
to
the
back
porch
for
a
drink
water
was
such
an
aggravation
he
crossed
the
yard
went
out
the
back
gate
and
down
the
alley
when
he
came
back
up
the
street
he
was
pompously
maliciously
dangerously
drunk
either
less
or
more
would
have
been
better
when
he
came
in
sight
of
the
mill
standing
new
and
shining
in
the
moonlight
he
was
a
lord
of
creation
ready
to
work
creation
to
his
will
he
would
go
over
and
see
if
things
were
all
right
but
he
did
not
cross
the
bridge
he
went
down
the
side
street
and
entered
the
yard
at
the
back
the
doors
were
closed
and
locked
but
there
was
as
yet
no
latch
on
the
sliding
windows
above
the
work
bench
he
could
push
them
open
from
the
ground
he
leaned
a
board
against
the
side
of
the
mill
set
his
foot
on
it
and
pulled
himself
up
so
that
he
could
climb
on
the
bench
that
much
achieved
he
looked
around
him
after
a
time
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
darkness
so
that
he
could
see
his
way
plainly
muddled
began
to
filter
through
his
brain
he
remembered
he
was
abused
he
was
out
of
it
he
remembered
that
he
was
not
the
buyer
for
the
mill
he
remembered
how
the
men
had
laughed
when
he
had
said
that
he
was
to
be
the
salesman
he
remembered
that
milton
had
said
that
he
was
not
to
touch
the
machinery
he
at
once
slid
from
the
bench
and
went
to
the
boiler
he
opened
the
door
of
the
and
saw
the
kindling
laid
ready
to
light
to
get
up
steam
he
looked
at
the
big
log
on
the
set
carriage
they
had
planned
to
start
with
a
splurge
in
the
morning
kate
was
to
open
the
throttle
that
started
the
machinery
he
decided
to
show
them
that
they
were
not
so
smart
he
would
give
them
a
good
surprise
by
sawing
the
log
that
would
be
a
joke
on
them
to
brag
about
the
remainder
of
his
life
he
took
matches
from
his
pocket
and
started
the
fire
it
seemed
to
his
fevered
imagination
that
it
burned
far
too
slowly
he
shoved
in
more
kindling
shavings
ends
left
from
siding
this
smothered
his
fire
so
he
made
trip
after
trip
to
the
tinder
box
piling
in
armloads
of
dry
inflammable
stuff
then
suddenly
the
flames
leaped
up
he
slammed
shut
the
door
and
started
toward
the
saw
he
could
not
make
it
work
he
jammed
and
pulled
everything
he
could
reach
soon
he
realized
the
heat
was
becoming
intense
and
turned
to
the
boiler
to
see
that
the
was
red
hot
almost
all
over
white
hot
in
places
my
god
he
muttered
too
hot
got
to
cool
that
down
then
he
saw
the
tank
and
the
dangling
hose
and
remembered
that
he
had
not
filled
the
boiler
taking
down
the
hose
he
opened
the
watercock
stuck
in
the
nozzle
and
turned
on
the
water
full
force
windows
were
broken
across
the
street
parts
of
the
boiler
and
fire
flew
everywhere
the
walls
blew
out
the
roof
lifted
and
came
down
the
fire
raged
among
the
new
dry
timbers
of
the
mill
when
her
windows
blew
in
kate
was
thrown
from
her
bed
to
the
floor
she
lay
stunned
a
second
then
dragged
herself
up
to
look
across
the
street
there
was
nothing
where
the
low
white
expanse
of
roof
had
spread
an
hour
before
while
a
red
glare
was
creeping
everywhere
over
the
ground
she
ran
to
george
room
and
found
it
empty
she
ran
to
the
kitchen
calling
him
and
found
the
back
door
standing
open
she
rushed
back
to
her
room
and
began
trying
to
put
on
her
dress
over
her
nightrobe
she
could
not
control
her
shaking
fingers
while
at
each
step
she
cut
her
feet
on
broken
glass
she
reached
the
front
door
as
the
children
came
screaming
with
fright
in
turning
to
warn
them
about
the
glass
she
stumbled
on
the
top
step
pitched
forward
headlong
then
lay
still
the
neighbours
carried
her
back
to
her
bed
called
the
doctor
and
then
saved
all
the
logs
in
the
yard
they
could
the
following
day
when
the
fire
had
burned
itself
out
the
undertaker
hunted
assiduously
but
nothing
could
be
found
to
justify
a
funeral
chapter
xx
for
a
good
girl
for
a
week
kate
lay
so
dazed
she
did
not
care
whether
she
lived
or
died
then
she
slowly
crept
back
to
life
realizing
that
whether
she
cared
or
not
she
must
live
she
was
too
young
too
strong
to
quit
because
she
was
soul
sick
she
had
to
go
on
she
had
life
to
face
for
herself
and
her
children
she
wondered
dully
about
her
people
but
as
none
of
the
neighbours
who
had
taken
care
of
her
said
anything
concerning
them
she
realized
that
they
had
not
been
there
at
first
she
was
almost
glad
they
were
forthright
people
they
would
have
had
something
to
say
they
would
have
said
it
tersely
and
to
the
point
adam
had
wound
up
her
affairs
speedily
by
selling
the
logs
he
had
bought
for
her
to
the
hartley
mills
paying
what
she
owed
and
depositing
the
remainder
in
the
hartley
bank
to
her
credit
but
that
remainder
was
less
than
one
hundred
dollars
that
winter
was
a
long
dreadful
nightmare
to
kate
had
it
not
been
for
aunt
ollie
they
would
have
been
hungry
some
of
the
time
they
were
cold
most
of
it
for
weeks
kate
thought
of
sending
for
her
mother
or
going
to
her
then
as
not
even
a
line
came
from
any
of
her
family
she
realized
that
they
resented
her
losing
that
much
bates
money
so
bitterly
that
they
wished
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
often
she
sat
for
hours
staring
straight
before
her
trying
to
straighten
out
the
tangle
she
had
made
of
her
life
as
if
she
had
not
suffered
enough
in
the
reality
of
living
she
now
lived
over
in
day
and
night
dreams
hour
by
hour
her
time
with
george
holt
and
gained
nothing
thereby
all
winter
kate
brooded
barely
managing
to
keep
alive
and
the
children
in
school
as
spring
opened
she
shook
herself
arose
and
went
to
work
it
was
not
planned
systematic
effective
bates
work
piecemeal
she
did
anything
she
saw
needed
the
doing
the
children
helped
to
make
garden
and
clean
the
yard
then
all
of
them
went
out
to
aunt
ollie
and
made
a
contract
to
plant
and
raise
potatoes
and
vegetables
on
shares
they
passed
a
neglected
garden
on
the
way
and
learning
that
the
woman
of
the
house
was
ill
kate
stopped
and
offered
to
tend
it
for
enough
cords
of
windfall
wood
to
pay
her
a
fair
price
this
to
be
delivered
in
with
food
and
fire
assured
kate
ripped
up
some
of
george
clothing
washed
pressed
turned
and
made
adam
warm
clothes
for
school
she
even
achieved
a
dress
for
polly
by
making
a
front
and
back
from
a
pair
of
her
father
trouser
legs
and
setting
in
side
pieces
a
yoke
and
sleeves
from
one
of
her
old
skirts
george
underclothing
she
cut
down
for
both
of
the
children
then
drew
another
check
for
taxes
and
books
while
she
was
in
hartley
in
the
fall
paying
taxes
she
stopped
at
a
dry
goods
store
for
thread
and
heard
a
customer
asking
for
knitted
mittens
which
were
not
in
stock
after
he
had
gone
she
arranged
with
the
merchant
for
a
supply
of
yarn
which
she
carried
home
and
began
to
knit
into
mittens
such
as
had
been
called
for
she
used
every
minute
of
leisure
during
the
day
she
worked
hours
into
the
night
and
soon
small
sums
began
coming
her
way
when
she
had
a
supply
of
teamster
heavy
mittens
she
began
on
fancy
coloured
ones
for
babies
and
children
sometimes
crocheting
sometimes
using
needles
soon
she
started
both
children
on
the
rougher
work
with
her
they
were
glad
to
help
for
they
had
a
lively
remembrance
of
one
winter
of
cold
and
hunger
with
no
christmas
that
there
were
many
things
she
might
have
done
that
would
have
made
more
money
with
less
exertion
kate
never
seemed
to
realize
she
did
the
obvious
thing
her
brain
power
seemed
to
be
on
a
level
with
that
of
adam
and
polly
when
the
children
began
to
carry
home
christmas
talk
kate
opened
her
mouth
to
say
the
things
that
had
been
said
to
her
as
a
child
then
tightly
closed
it
she
began
getting
up
earlier
sitting
up
later
knitting
feverishly
luckily
the
merchant
could
sell
all
she
could
furnish
as
the
time
drew
nearer
she
gathered
from
the
talk
of
the
children
what
was
the
deepest
desire
of
their
hearts
one
day
a
heavy
wind
driving
trees
in
the
back
yard
broke
quite
a
large
limb
from
a
cherry
tree
kate
dragged
it
into
the
woodhouse
to
make
firewood
she
leaned
it
against
the
wall
to
wait
until
the
ice
melted
and
as
it
stood
there
in
its
silvery
coat
she
thought
how
like
a
small
tree
the
branch
was
shaped
and
how
pretty
it
looked
after
the
children
had
gone
to
school
the
next
day
she
shaped
it
with
the
hatchet
and
saw
and
fastened
it
in
a
small
box
this
she
carried
to
her
bedroom
and
locked
the
door
she
had
not
much
idea
what
she
was
going
to
do
but
she
kept
thinking
soon
she
found
enough
time
to
wrap
every
branch
carefully
with
the
red
tissue
paper
her
red
knitting
wool
came
in
and
to
cover
the
box
smoothly
then
she
thought
of
the
country
christmas
trees
she
had
seen
decorated
with
popcorn
and
cranberries
she
popped
the
corn
at
night
and
the
following
day
made
a
trip
up
the
ravine
where
she
gathered
all
the
bittersweet
berries
swamp
holly
and
wild
rose
seed
heads
she
could
find
she
strung
the
corn
on
fine
cotton
cord
putting
a
rose
seed
pod
between
each
grain
then
used
the
bittersweet
berries
to
terminate
the
blunt
ends
of
the
branches
and
climb
up
the
trunk
by
the
time
she
had
finished
this
she
was
really
interested
she
achieved
a
gold
star
for
the
top
from
a
box
lid
and
a
piece
of
gilt
paper
polly
had
carried
home
from
school
with
yarn
ends
and
mosquito
netting
she
whipped
up
a
few
little
mittens
stockings
and
bags
she
cracked
nuts
from
their
fall
store
and
melting
a
little
sugar
stirred
in
the
kernels
until
they
were
covered
with
a
sweet
white
glaze
then
she
made
some
hard
candy
and
some
fancy
cookies
with
a
few
sticks
of
striped
candy
cut
in
circles
and
dotted
on
the
top
she
polished
red
yellow
and
green
apples
and
set
them
under
the
tree
when
she
made
her
final
trip
to
hartley
before
christmas
the
spirit
of
the
day
was
in
the
air
she
breathed
so
much
of
it
that
she
paid
a
dollar
and
a
half
for
a
stout
sled
and
ten
cents
for
a
dozen
little
red
candles
five
each
for
two
oranges
and
fifteen
each
for
two
pretty
little
books
then
after
long
hesitation
added
a
doll
for
polly
she
felt
that
she
should
not
have
done
this
and
said
so
to
herself
but
knew
if
she
had
it
to
do
over
she
would
do
the
same
thing
again
she
shook
her
shoulders
and
took
the
first
step
toward
regaining
her
old
pshaw
big
and
strong
as
i
am
and
adam
getting
such
a
great
boy
we
can
make
it
she
said
then
she
hurried
to
the
hack
and
was
driven
home
barely
in
time
to
rush
her
bundles
into
her
room
before
school
was
out
she
could
scarcely
wait
until
the
children
were
in
bed
to
open
the
parcels
the
doll
had
to
be
dressed
but
kate
was
interested
in
christmas
by
that
time
and
so
contemplated
the
image
with
real
affection
she
never
had
owned
a
doll
herself
she
let
the
knitting
go
that
night
and
cut
up
an
old
waist
to
make
white
with
touches
of
lace
and
a
pretty
dress
then
kate
went
to
her
room
tied
the
doll
in
a
safe
place
on
the
tree
put
on
the
books
and
set
the
candles
with
pins
as
she
worked
she
kept
biting
her
lips
but
when
it
was
all
finished
she
thought
it
was
lovely
and
so
it
was
as
she
set
the
sled
in
front
of
the
tree
she
said
there
little
folks
i
wonder
what
you
will
think
of
that
it
the
best
i
can
do
i
a
nice
chicken
to
roast
now
if
only
if
only
mother
or
nancy
ellen
would
come
or
write
a
line
or
merely
send
one
word
by
tilly
nepple
suddenly
kate
lay
down
on
the
bed
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
while
her
shoulders
jerked
and
shook
in
dry
sobs
for
a
long
time
at
last
she
arose
went
to
the
kitchen
bathed
her
face
and
banked
the
fires
i
suppose
it
is
the
bates
way
she
said
but
it
a
cold
hard
proposition
i
know
what
the
matter
with
all
of
them
they
are
afraid
to
come
near
me
or
show
the
slightest
friendliness
for
fear
i
ask
them
to
help
support
us
they
need
worry
we
can
take
care
of
ourselves
she
set
her
tree
on
the
living
room
table
arranged
everything
to
the
best
advantage
laid
a
fire
in
the
stove
and
went
to
sleep
christmas
eve
feeling
more
like
herself
than
she
had
since
the
explosion
christmas
morning
she
had
the
house
warm
and
the
tree
ready
to
light
while
the
children
dressed
she
slipped
away
their
clothing
and
laid
out
their
best
instead
she
could
hear
them
talking
as
they
dressed
and
knew
the
change
of
clothing
had
filled
them
with
hope
she
hastily
lighted
the
tree
and
was
setting
the
table
as
they
entered
the
dining
room
merry
christmas
little
people
she
cried
in
a
voice
they
had
not
heard
in
a
long
time
they
both
rushed
to
her
and
kate
heart
stood
still
as
they
each
hugged
her
tight
kissed
her
and
offered
a
tiny
packet
from
the
size
and
feeling
of
these
she
realized
that
they
were
giving
her
the
candy
they
had
received
the
day
before
at
school
surprises
were
coming
thick
and
fast
with
kate
that
one
shook
her
to
her
foundations
they
loved
candy
they
had
so
little
they
had
nothing
else
to
give
she
held
them
an
instant
so
tightly
they
were
surprised
at
her
then
she
told
them
to
lay
the
packages
on
the
living
room
table
until
after
breakfast
polly
opened
the
door
and
screamed
adam
ran
and
then
both
of
them
stood
silently
before
the
brave
little
tree
flaming
red
touched
with
white
its
gold
star
shining
they
looked
at
it
and
then
at
each
other
while
kate
watching
at
an
angle
across
the
dining
room
distinctly
heard
polly
say
in
an
awed
tone
adam
had
we
better
pray
kate
lifted
herself
full
height
and
drew
a
deep
breath
well
i
guess
i
manage
a
little
christmas
after
this
she
said
and
maybe
a
fourth
of
july
and
a
birthday
and
a
few
other
things
i
need
be
such
a
coward
i
believe
i
can
make
it
from
that
hour
she
began
trying
to
think
of
something
she
could
do
that
would
bring
returns
more
nearly
commensurate
with
the
time
and
strength
she
was
spending
she
felt
tied
to
walden
because
she
owned
the
house
and
could
rely
on
working
on
shares
with
aunt
ollie
for
winter
food
but
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
there
and
take
care
of
the
children
that
would
bring
more
than
the
most
meagre
living
still
they
were
living
each
year
more
comfortably
the
children
were
growing
bigger
and
stronger
soon
they
could
help
at
something
if
only
she
could
think
what
the
time
flew
each
day
a
repetition
of
dogged
grind
until
some
days
kate
was
close
to
despair
each
day
the
house
grew
shabbier
things
wore
out
and
could
not
be
replaced
poverty
showed
itself
more
plainly
so
three
more
years
of
life
in
walden
passed
setting
their
indelible
mark
on
kate
time
and
again
she
almost
broke
the
spell
that
bound
her
but
she
never
quite
reached
the
place
where
her
thought
cleared
her
heart
regained
its
courage
her
soul
dared
take
wing
and
try
another
flight
when
she
thought
of
it
i
do
so
much
mind
the
falling
said
kate
to
herself
but
i
do
seem
to
select
the
hardest
spots
to
light
on
kate
sat
on
the
back
steps
the
sun
shone
her
nearest
neighbour
was
spading
an
onion
bed
she
knew
that
presently
she
would
get
out
the
rake
and
spade
and
begin
another
year
work
but
at
that
minute
she
felt
too
hopeless
to
move
adam
came
and
sat
on
the
step
beside
her
she
looked
at
him
and
was
surprised
at
his
size
and
apparent
strength
someway
he
gave
her
hope
he
was
a
good
boy
he
had
never
done
a
mean
sneaking
thing
that
she
knew
of
he
was
natural
normal
mischievous
but
he
had
not
an
underhand
inclination
that
she
could
discover
he
would
make
a
big
man
quite
as
fine
as
any
of
the
bates
men
even
adam
was
no
handsomer
than
the
fourth
adam
would
be
hope
arose
in
her
with
the
cool
air
of
spring
on
her
cheek
and
its
wine
in
her
nostrils
then
out
of
the
clear
sky
she
said
it
adam
how
long
are
we
going
to
stay
in
the
beggar
class
adam
jumped
and
turned
surprised
eyes
toward
her
kate
was
forced
to
justify
herself
of
course
we
give
aunt
ollie
half
we
raise
she
said
but
anybody
would
do
that
we
work
hard
and
we
live
little
if
any
better
than
jasons
who
have
the
county
trustee
in
three
times
a
winter
i
big
and
strong
you
almost
a
man
why
do
we
do
something
why
we
have
some
decent
clothes
some
money
for
out
work
and
kate
spoke
at
random
a
horse
and
carriage
a
horse
and
carriage
repeated
adam
staring
at
her
why
not
said
kate
casually
but
how
cried
the
amazed
boy
why
earn
the
money
and
buy
it
said
kate
impatiently
i
about
fed
up
on
earning
cabbage
and
potatoes
and
skirmishing
for
wood
prefer
to
have
a
dollar
in
my
pocket
and
buy
what
we
need
ca
you
use
your
brain
and
help
me
figure
out
a
way
to
earn
some
money
i
meant
to
pretty
soon
now
but
i
thought
i
had
to
go
to
school
a
few
years
yet
he
said
of
course
you
do
said
kate
i
must
earn
the
money
but
ca
you
help
me
think
how
sure
said
adam
sitting
straight
and
seeming
thoughtful
but
give
me
a
little
time
what
would
you
could
you
do
i
taught
before
i
was
married
said
kate
but
methods
of
teaching
change
so
i
have
to
have
a
normal
term
to
qualify
for
even
this
school
i
could
put
you
and
polly
with
aunt
ollie
this
summer
but
i
would
not
if
we
must
freeze
and
starve
together
because
of
grandma
asked
the
boy
kate
nodded
i
borrowed
money
to
go
once
and
i
could
again
but
i
have
been
away
from
teaching
so
long
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
you
children
the
thing
i
would
like
would
be
to
find
a
piece
of
land
somewhere
with
a
house
any
kind
of
one
on
it
and
take
it
to
rent
land
is
about
all
i
really
know
working
for
money
would
be
of
some
interest
i
am
so
dead
tired
working
for
potatoes
sometimes
i
see
them
flying
around
in
the
air
at
night
do
you
know
of
any
place
you
would
like
asked
adam
no
i
do
said
kate
but
i
am
going
to
begin
asking
and
i
going
to
keep
my
eyes
open
i
heard
yesterday
that
james
intends
to
build
a
new
house
this
house
is
nothing
but
the
lot
is
in
the
prettiest
place
in
town
let
sell
it
to
him
and
take
the
money
and
buy
us
some
new
furniture
and
a
cow
and
a
team
and
wagon
and
a
buggy
and
go
on
a
piece
of
land
and
live
like
other
people
seems
to
me
i
die
if
i
have
to
work
for
potatoes
any
longer
i
heart
sick
of
them
do
say
a
word
to
anybody
but
oh
adam

think
hard
ca
you
just
help
me

you
are
sure

the
boy

said
kate
how
do
you
feel
about
it
i
want
horses
and
cows
and
pigs
lots
of
pigs
and
sheep
and
lots
of
white
hens
said
adam
promptly
get
the
spade
and
spade
the
onion
bed
until
i
think

kate
and
that
reminds
me
we
did
divide
the
sets
last
fall

go
after
them

said
adam
but
it
awful
early
it
snow
again
let
me
go
after
school
friday
and
stay
over
night
i
like
to
go
and
stay
over
night
with
aunt
ollie
grandma
ca
say
anything
to
me
that
listen
to
you
keep
polly
and
let
me
go
alone
sure
i
can
all
right
said
kate
spade
the
bed
and
let
it
warm
a
day
it
will
be
good
for
it
but
do
tell
polly
you
going
or
she
want
to
go
along
until
friday
night
kate
and
adam
went
around
in
such
a
daze
of
deep
thought
that
they
stumbled
and
ran
against
each
other
then
came
back
to
their
affairs
suddenly
looking
at
each
other
and
smiling
understandingly
after
one
of
these
encounters
kate
said
to
the
boy
you
may
not
arrive
at
anything
adam
but
i
certainly
ca
complain
that
you
are
not
thinking
adam
grinned
i
not
so
sure
that
i
have
got
it
he
said
tell
me
quick
and
let
me
think
too
said
kate
but
i
ca
tell
you
yet
said
adam
i
have
to
find
out
something
first
friday
evening
he
wanted
to
put
off
his
trip
until
saturday
morning
so
kate
agreed
she
was
surprised
when
he
bathed
and
put
on
his
clean
shirt
and
trousers
but
said
not
a
word
she
had
made
some
study
of
child
psychology
she
thought
making
the
trip
alone
was
of
so
much
importance
to
adam
that
he
was
dressing
for
the
occasion
she
foresaw
extra
washing
yet
she
said
nothing
to
stop
the
lad
she
waved
to
him
thinking
how
sturdy
and
good
looking
he
was
as
he
ran
out
of
the
front
door
kate
was
beginning
to
be
worried
when
adam
had
not
returned
toward
dusk
sunday
evening
and
polly
was
cross
and
fretful
finally
they
saw
him
coming
down
the
ravine
bank
carrying
his
small
bundle
of
sets
kate
felt
a
glow
of
relief
polly
ran
to
meet
him
kate
watched
as
they
met
and
saw
adam
take
polly
hand
if
only
they
looked
as
much
alike
as
some
twins
do
i
be
thankful
said
kate
adam
delivered
the
sets
said
aunt
ollie
and
grandma
were
all
right
that
it
was
an
awful
long
walk
and
he
was
tired
kate
noticed
that
his
feet
were
dust
covered
but
his
clothes
were
so
clean
she
said
to
him
you
did
fish
much
i
did
fish
any
said
adam
not
like
i
always
fish
he
added
had
any
time
to
think
asked
kate
you
just
bet
i
did
said
the
boy
i
did
waste
a
minute
neither
did
i
said
kate
i
know
exactly
what
the
prettiest
lot
in
town
can
be
sold
for
good
cried
adam
fine
monday
kate
wanted
to
get
up
early
and
stick
the
sets
but
adam
insisted
that
aunt
ollie
said
the
sign
would
not
be
right
until
wednesday
if
they
were
stuck
on
monday
or
tuesday
they
would
all
grow
to
top
my
goodness
i
knew
that
said
kate
i
am
thinking
so
hard
losing
what
little
sense
i
had
but
anyway
mere
thinking
is
doing
me
a
world
of
good
i
am
beginning
to
feel
a
kind
of
rising
joy
inside
and
i
ca
imagine
anything
else
that
makes
it
adam
went
to
school
laughing
kate
did
the
washing
and
ironing
and
worked
in
the
garden
getting
beds
ready
tuesday
she
was
at
the
same
occupation
when
about
ten
she
dropped
her
spade
and
straightened
a
flash
of
perfect
amazement
crossing
her
face
she
stood
immovable
save
for
swaying
forward
in
an
attitude
of
tense
listening
hoo
hoo
kate
ran
across
the
yard
and
as
she
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
she
saw
a
spring
wagon
standing
before
the
gate
while
a
stiff
gaunt
figure
sat
bolt
upright
on
the
seat
holding
the
lines
kate
was
at
the
wheel
looking
up
with
a
face
of
delighted
amazement
why
mother
she
cried
why
mother
go
fetch
a
chair
and
help
me
down
said
bates
this
seat
is
getting
tarnation
hard
kate
ran
after
a
chair
and
helped
her
mother
to
alight
bates
promptly
took
the
chair
on
the
sidewalk
just
drop
the
thills
she
said
lead
him
back
and
slip
on
the
halter
it
there
with
his
feed
kate
followed
instructions
her
heart
beating
wildly
several
times
she
ventured
a
quick
glance
at
her
mother
how
she
had
aged
how
lined
and
thin
she
was
but
oh
how
blessed
good
it
was
to
see
her
bates
arose
and
they
walked
into
the
house
where
she
looked
keenly
around
while
her
sharp
eyes
seemed
to
appraise
everything
as
she
sat
down
and
removed
her
bonnet
go
fetch
me
a
drink
she
said
and
take
the
horse
one
and
then

kate
but

bates

said
kate
hurried
to
obey
orders
then
she
sank
on
a
chair
and
looked
at
her
mother
bates
wiped
her
face
and
settled
in
the
chair
comfortably
they
no
use
to
waste
words
she
said
katie
you
the
only
one
in
the
family
that
has
any
sense
and
sometimes
you
ai
got
enough
so
you
could
notice
it
without
a
magnifyin
glass
but
even
so
you
ahead
of
the
rest
of
them
katie
i
sick
an
tired
of
the
neppleses
and
the
whistlers
and
being
bossed
by
the
whole
bates
tribe
sick
and
tired
of
it
so
i
just
came
after

kate
stupidly
yes

after
you
said
bates
i
told
you
no
great
amount
of
sense
i
speakin
plain
ai
i
i
do

much
here
to
hold
you
i
want
you

throw
a
few
traps

beholden
to
in
the
wagon
that

so
long
i
wo
interfere

i
kep
the
place
in
order
but
i
about
fashed
i
wo
admit
it
to
the
rest
of
them

i
do
seem
to
mind
telling
you
katie
that
i
am
almost
winded
will
you
come
of
course
i
will
said
kate
a
tide
of
effulgent
joy
surging
up
in
her
heart
until
it
almost
choked
her
of
course
i
will
mother
but
my
children
wo
they
worry
you
never
having
had
a
child
about
i
likely
they
may
said
bates
dryly
why
you
little
fool
i
think
likely
it
the
children
i
am
pinin
for
most
though
i
could
it
much
longer
without

kate
if

it
there
very
little
here

for
i
can
have
the
man
give
me
what
he
will
for
the
rest
and
i
can
get
a
good
price
for
the
lot
if
i
say
so
james
wants
it
to
build
on
i
go

do
the
very
best
i

ready
at
once
if
you
want
me
to
not
much
of
a
haggler

katie
said
bates
why
you
ask
what
rooms
you
to
have
and
what
i
pay
you
and
how
much
work
you
have
to
do
and
if
you
take
charge
of
the
farm
and
how
we
share
up
kate
laughed
mother
she
said
i
have
been
going
to
school
here
with
the
master
of
life
for
a
teacher
and
i
learned
so
many
things
that
really
count
that
i
know
now
none
of
the
things
you
mention
are
essential
you
may
keep
the
answers
to
all
those
questions
i
care
a
cent
about
any
of
them
if
you
want
me
and
want
the
children
all
those
things
will
settle
themselves
as
we
come
to
them
i
use
to
understand
you
but
we
got
well
enough
acquainted
at
funeral
and
i
do
now
whatever
you
do
will
be
fair
just
and
right
i
obey
you
as
i
shall
expect
adam
and
polly
to
well
for
lands
sakes
katie
said
bates
life

weltin
it
to
you
good
and
proper
i
never
expected
to
see
you
as
meek
as
moses
that
holt
man
was
big
enough
to
beat
you
was
he
the
ways
in
which
he
me
no
bates
would
understand
i
had
eight
years
of
them
and
i
do
understand
them
yet
but
i
am
so
cooked
with
them
that
i
shall
be
wild
with
joy
if
you
truly
mean
for
me
to
pack
up
and
come
home
with
you
for
awhile
oh
lordy
katie

earth
but
to
go
home
with
you
and
do
as
you
say
for
the
next
ten
years
said
kate
stiffen
up
cried
bates
stiffen
up
do
be
no
broken
reed
katie
i
do
want
you
dependin
on
me
i
came
to
see
if
you
would
let
me
lean
on
you
the
rest
of
the
way
i
figuring
that
there
was
anything
on
this
earth
that
could
get
you
down
so
i
was
calculatin
you
be
the
very
one
to
hold
me
up
since
you
seem
to
be
feeling
unaccountably
weak
in
the
knees
let
see
if
we
can
brace
them
a
little
livin
with
pa
so
long
must

tendency
toward
nussin
a
deed

had
executed
two
years
ago
and
i
was
a
coming
with
it

a
long
sealed
envelope
from
the
front
of
her
dress
and
tossed
it
in
kate
lap
mother
what

this
asked
kate
in
a
hushed
voice
well
if

your
ears

your
eyes
it
all
the
same
to
me
said
bates
the
boys

a
mortal
itchin
to
get
their
fingers
on
the
papers

the
case

ca
say
i
do
like
the
difference

dead
tired
of
the
neighbours
taking
care
of
me
and
all
of
the
children
stoppin
every
time
they
pass
each
one
orderin
or
according
to
their
lights
as
to
what
i
should
do
i
always
had
a
purty
clear
idea
of
what
i
wanted
to
do
myself
over
forty
years
i
sided
with
pa
to
keep
the
peace
now
i
reckon
i
free
to
do
as
i
like
that
my
side
you
can
tell
me

now
kate
shook
her
head
i
have
nothing
to
say
jest
as
well
said
bates
do
do
any
good
come
back
and
come
but

up
that
paper

a
warrantee
deed
to
the
home
two
hundred
to
you
and
your
children
after
you
you
take
possession

or

places
floorin
the
kitchen

your
company

me
limb
for
limb
i
do
dare
take
this
oh

you
asked
bates

for
quite
a
bit
at
bates
corners
and
i
say
you
will
take
that
farm
and
run
it
as
you
like
it
is
mine
i
give
it
to
you
we
all
know
it
was
your
fault
you
lost
your
money
though
it
was
a
dose
it
took
some
of
us
a
good
long
time
to
swallow
you
are
the
only
one
out
of
your
share
you
settled
things
fine
for
the
rest
of
them
and
they
all
know
it
and
feel
it
you
never
know
what
you
did
for
me
the
way
you
put
me
through
pa
funeral
now
if
you
just
shut
up
and
stick
that
deed
somewhere
it
wo
burn
and
come
home
an
plant
me
as
successfully
as
you
did
pa
you
have
earned
all
you
get
an
something
coming
now
set
us
out
a
bite
to
eat
and
let
be
off
kate
slowly
arose
and
handed
back
the
deed
i
be
flying
around
so
lively
i
might
lose
that
she
said
you
put
it
where
you
had
it
till
we
get
to
hartley
and
then
i
get
a
place
in
the
bank
vault
for
it
i
ca
quite
take
this
in
just
yet
but
you
know
i
do
my
best
for
you
mother
tai
likely
i
be
here
else
said
bates
and
tea
katie
a
cup
of
good
strong
hot
tea
would
fix
me
up
about
proper
right
now
kate
went
to
the
kitchen
and
began
setting
everything
she
had
to
eat
on
the
table
as
she
worked
polly
came
flying
in
the
door
crying
mother
who
has
come
so
kate
stepped
toward
the
living
room
to
show
the
child
to
her
grandmother
and
as
she
advanced
she
saw
a
queer
thing
adam
was
sitting
on
his
grandmother
lap
her
arms
were
tight
around
him
her
face
buried
in
his
crisp
hair
and
he
was
patting
her
shoulder
and
telling
her
he
would
take
care
of
her
while
her
voice
said
distinctly
of
course
you
will
birdie
then
the
lad
and
the
old
woman
laid
their
heads
together
and
laughed
almost
hysterically
well
if
that
is
quick
work
said
kate
to
herself
then
she
presented
polly
who
followed
adam
lead
in
hugging
the
stranger
first
and
looking
at
her
afterward
god
bless
all
little
children
then
adam
ran
to
tell
the
man
to
come
at
one
and
james
that
he
might
have
the
keys
at
three
they
ate
hurriedly
kate
set
out
what
she
wished
to
save
the
children
carried
things
to
the
wagon
she
packed
while
they
ran
after
their
books
and
at
three
all
of
them
climbed
into
the
spring
wagon
and
started
to
bates
corners
kate
was
the
last
one
in
as
she
climbed
on
the
seat
beside
her
mother
and
took
the
lines
she
handed
bates
a
small
china
mug
to
hold
for
her
it
was
decorated
with
a
very
fat
robin
and
on
a
banner
floating
from
its
beak
was
inscribed
for
a
good
girl
chapter
xxi
life
boomerang
as
they
drove
into
hartley
bates
drew
forth
the
deed
you
are
right
about
the
bank
being
a
safe
place
for
this
she
said
i
had
it
round
the
house
for
two
years
and
it
a
fair
nervous
thing
to
do
i
wish
i
sense
to
put
it
there
and
come
after
you
the
day
i
made
it
but
there
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
nor
fussin
with
the
grease
spot
it
makes
salt
it
down
safely
now
and
when
you
get
it
done
beings
as
this
setting
is
fairly
comfortable
take
time
to
run
into
harding
and
pick
up
some
clothes
for
the
children
that
will
tally
up
with
the
rest
of
their
relations
an
get
yourself
a
cheap
frock
or
two
that
will
spruce
you
up
a
bit
till
you
have
time
to
decide
what
you
really
want
kate
passed
the
lines
to
her
mother
and
climbed
from
the
wagon
she
returned
with
her
confidence
partly
restored
and
a
new
look
on
her
face
her
mother
handed
her
two
dimes
i
can
wait
five
minutes
longer
she
said
now
get
two
nice
oranges
and
a
dime
worth
of
candy
kate
took
the
money
and
obeyed
orders
she
handed
the
packages
to
her
mother
as
she
climbed
into
the
wagon
and
again
took
the
lines
heading
the
horse
toward
the
old
familiar
road
her
mother
twisted
around
on
the
seat
and
gave
each
of
the
children
an
orange
and
a
stick
of
candy
there
she
said
go
on
and
spoil
yourselves
past
redemption
kate
laughed
but
mother
she
said
you
never
did
that
for
us
which
ai
saying
i
never
wanted
to
said
bates
sourly
you
a
child
only
once
in
this
world
it
a
little
too
rough
to
strip
childhood
of
everything
i
ai
so
certain
bates
ways
are
right
that
for
the
rest
of
my
time
i
goin
to
fly
in
the
face
of
all
creation
to
prove
it
if
god
lets
me
live
a
few
years
more
i
want
the
faces
around
me
a
little
less
discontenteder
than
those
i
been
used
to
if
god
almighty
spares
me
long
enough
i
lay
out
to
make
sure
that
adam
and
polly
will
squeeze
out
a
tear
or
two
for
granny
when
she
is
laid
away
i
think
you
are
right
mother
said
kate
it
did
cost
anything
but
we
had
a
real
pretty
christmas
tree
this
year
and
i
believe
we
can
do
better
next
time
i
want
the
children
to
love
you
but
do
buy
them
well
i
hardly
call
an
orange
and
a
stick
of
candy
traffickin
in
affection
said
bates
they
survive
it
without
their
principles
i
be
bound
or
yours
either
katie
let
make
a
beginning
let
work
what
is
right
and
healthy
a
fair
part
of
the
day
and
then
each
day
and
sunday
especially
let
play
and
rest
just
as
hard
as
we
work
it
been
all
work
and
no
play
till
we
been
mighty
boys
at
our
house
i
free
to
say
that
i
hanker
for
a
change
before
i
die
do
speak
so
often
of
dying
said
kate
you
all
right
been
too
much
alone
you
feel
like
yourself
as
soon
as
you
get
rested
i
guess
i
been
thinking
about
it
too
much
said
bates
i
been
so
well
as
i
might
an
not
being
used
to
it
it
worries
me
some
i
got
to
buck
up
the
one
thing
i
ca
do
is
to
die
but
i
most
tired
enough
to
do
it
right
now
i
be
glad
when
we
get
home
kate
drove
carefully
but
as
fast
as
she
dared
with
her
load
as
they
neared
bates
corners
the
way
became
more
familiar
each
mile
kate
forgot
the
children
forgot
her
mother
forgot
ten
years
of
disappointment
and
failure
and
began
a
struggle
to
realize
what
was
happening
to
her
now
the
lines
slipped
down
the
horse
walked
slowly
the
first
thing
she
knew
big
hot
tears
splashed
on
her
hand
she
gathered
up
the
lines
drew
a
deep
breath
and
glanced
at
her
mother
meeting
her
eye
fairly
kate
tried
to
smile
but
her
lips
were
quivering
glad
katie
asked
bates
kate
nodded
me
too
said
bates
they
passed
the
orchard
there
the
house
there
polly
cried
adam
why
adam
how
did
you
know
the
place
asked
kate
turning
adam
hesitated
a
second
ai
you
told
us
times
about
the
house
and
the
lilac
and
the
snowball
bush
yes
and
the
cabbage
roses
added
polly
so
i
have
said
kate
mostly
last
winter
when
we
were
knitting
yes

will
be
home
for
all
the
rest
of
our
lives
is
it
grand

ever
thank
grandmother
how
will
we
ever
be
good
enough
to
pay
her
both
children
thought
this
a
hint
so
with
one
accord
they
arose
and
fell
on
bates
back
and
began
to
pay
at
once
in
coin
of
childhood
there
there
said
kate
drawing
them
away
as
she
stopped
the
horse
at
the
gate
there
there
you
will
choke
grandmother
bates
pushed
kate
arm
down
mind
your
own
business
will
you
she
said
i
ai
so
feeble
that
i
ca
speak
for
myself
awhile
yet
in
a
daze
kate
climbed
down
and
ran
to
bring
a
chair
to
help
her
mother
the
children
were
boisterously
half
eating
bates
up
she
had
both
of
them
in
her
arms
with
every
outward
evidence
of
enjoying
the
performance
immensely
that
was
a
very
busy
evening
for
the
wagon
was
to
be
unpacked
all
of
them
were
hungry
while
the
stock
was
to
be
fed
and
the
milking
done
bates
and
polly
attempted
supper
kate
and
adam
went
to
the
barn
but
they
worked
very
hurriedly
for
kate
could
see
how
feeble
her
mother
had
grown
when
at
last
the
children
were
bathed
and
in
bed
kate
and
her
mother
sat
on
the
little
front
porch
to
smell
spring
a
few
minutes
before
going
to
rest
kate
reached
over
and
took
her
mother
hand
there
no
word
i
know
in
any
language
big
enough
to
thank
you
for
this
mother
she
said
the
best
i
can
do
is
make
each
day
as
nearly
a
perfect
expression
of
what
i
feel
as
possible
bates
drew
away
her
hand
and
used
it
to
wipe
her
eyes
but
she
said
with
her
usual
terse
perversity
my
kate
you
most
as
wordy
as
agatha
i
no
glibtonguer
but
i
bet
you
ten
dollars
it
will
hustle
you
some
to
be
any
gladder
than
i
am
kate
laughed
and
gave
up
the
thanks
question
we
must
get
some
onions
in
she
said
have
you
made
any
plans
about
the
farm
work
for
this
year
yet
no
said
bates
i
was
going
to
leave
that
till
i
decided
whether
i
come
after
you
this
spring
or
wait
until
next
since
i
decided
to
come
now
i
just
leave
your
farm
to
you
handle
it
as
you
please
mother
what
will
the
other
children
say
implored
kate
humph
you
are
about
as
well
acquainted
with
them
as
i
am
take
a
shot
at
it
yourself
if
it
will
avoid
a
fuss
we
might
just
say
you
had
to
come
to
stay
with
me
and
run
the
farm
for
me
and
let
them
get
used
to
your
being
here
and
bossing
things
by
degrees
like
the
man
that
cut
his
dog
tail
off
an
inch
at
a
time
so
it
would
hurt
so
bad
but
by
inches
or
one
fell
swoop
it
going
to
hurt
said
kate
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
said
bates
that
the
more
we
get
hurt
in
this
world
the
decenter
it
makes
us
all
the
boys
were
hurt
enough
when
pa
went
but
every
man
of
them
has
been
a
bigger
better
man
since
instead
of
competing
as
they
always
did
adam
and
andrew
and
the
older
beforehandeder
ones
took
hold
and
helped
the
younger
as
you
told
them
to
and
it
done
the
whole
family
a
world
of
good
one
thing
is
funny
to
hear
mary
talk
now
you
think
she
engineered
that
plan
herself
the
boys
are
all
thankful
and
so
are
the
girls
i
leave
it
to
you
tell
them
or
let
them
guess
it
by
degrees
it
all
one
to
me
tell
me
about
nancy
ellen
and
robert
said
kate
robert
stands
head
in
hartley
he
gets
bigger
and
broader
every
year
he
is
better
looking
than
a
man
has
any
business
to
be
and
i
hear
the
hartley
ladies
give
him
plenty
of
encouragement
in
being
stuck
on
himself
but
i
think
he
is
true
to
nancy
ellen
and
his
heart
is
all
in
his
work
no
children
that
a
burning
shame
both
of
them
feel
it
in
a
way
and
strictly
between
you
and
me
nancy
ellen
is
a
disappointment
to
me
an
i
doubt
if
she
ai
been
a
mite
of
a
one
to
him
he
had
a
right
to
expect
a
good
deal
of
nancy
ellen
she
had
such
a
good
brain
and
good
body
and
purty
face
i
may
miss
my
guess
but
it
always
strikes
me
that
she
falls
short
of
what
he
expected
of
her
he
coined
money
but
she
has
spent
it
in
the
ways
he
would
likely
i
should
say
it
but
he
strikes
me
as
being
just
a
leetle
mite
too
good
for
her
oh
mother
said
kate
now
you
lookey
here
said
bates
suppose
you
was
a
man
of
robert
brains
and
education
and
professional
ability
and
you
made
heaps
of
money
and
no
children
came
and
you
had
to
see
all
you
earned
and
stood
for
and
did
in
a
community
spent
on
the
selfishness
of
one
woman
how
big
would
you
feel
what
end
is
that
for
the
ambition
and
life
work
of
a
real
man
how
would
you
like
it
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
said
kate
well
mark
my
word
you
will
think
of
it
when
you
see
their
home
and
her
clothes
and
see
them
together
said
bates
she
still
loves
pretty
clothing
so
well
asked
kate
she
is
the
woman
in
the
county
and
the
best
looking
said
bates
and
that
all
there
is
to
her
i
free
to
say
with
her
chances
i
ashamed
of
what
she
has
and
has
made
of
herself
i
rather
stand
in
your
shoes
than
hers
this
minute
katie
does
she
know
i
here
asked
kate
yes
i
stopped
and
told
her
on
my
way
out
this
morning
said
bates
i
asked
them
to
come
out
for
sunday
dinner
and
they
are
coming
did
you
deliver
the
invitation
by
force
asked
kate
now
none
of
your
meddling
said
bates
i
got
what
i
went
after
and
that
was
all
i
wanted
i
told
her
an
told
her
to
come
to
see
you
during
the
last
three
years
an
i
know
she
wanted
to
come
but
she
just
had
that
stubborn
bates
streak
in
her
that
would
let
her
change
once
her
mind
was
made
up
it
did
give
us
a
purty
severe
jolt
kate
havin
all
that
good
bates
money
burn
up
i
scarcely
think
it
jolted
any
of
you
more
than
it
did
me
said
kate
dryly
no
i
reckon
it
did
said
bates
but
they
no
use
hauling
ourselves
over
the
coals
to
go
into
that
it
past
you
went
out
to
face
life
bravely
enough
and
it
throwed
you
a
boomerang
that
cut
a
circle
and
brought
you
back
where
you
started
from
our
arrangements
for
the
future
are
all
made
now
it
up
to
us
to
live
so
that
we
get
the
most
out
of
life
for
us
an
the
children
those
are
mighty
nice
children
of
yours
kate
i
take
to
that
boy
something
amazin
and
the
girl
is
the
nicest
little
old
lady
i
seen
in
many
a
day
i
think
we
will
like
knittin
and
sewin
together
to
the
top
of
our
bent
my
but
i
glad
you
like
them
mother
said
kate
they
are
all
i
got
to
show
for
ten
years
of
my
life
not
by
a
long
shot
katie
said
bates
life
has
made
a
real
woman
of
you
i
kept
watchin
you
comin
over
an
i
was
prouder
jehu
of
you
it
a
debatable
question
whether
you
have
thrown
away
your
time
and
your
money
i
say
you
got
something
to
show
for
it
that
i
wish
to
god
the
rest
of
my
children
had
i
want
you
should
brace
your
back
and
stiffen
your
neck
and
make
things
hum
here
get
a
carpenter
first
fix
the
house
the
way
it
will
be
most
convenient
and
comfortable
then
paint
and
paper
and
get
what
new
things
you
like
in
reason
of
course
in
reason
and
then
i
want
you
should
get
all
of
us
clothes
so
there
ai
a
noticeable
difference
between
us
and
the
others
when
we
come
together
here
or
elsewhere
put
in
a
telephone
they
mighty
handy
and
if
you
can
scrape
up
a
place
i
washed
in
nancy
ellen
tub
a
few
weeks
ago
i
never
was
wet
all
over
at
once
before
in
my
life
and
i
just
itching
to
try
it
again
i
say
let
have
it
if
it
knocks
a
hole
in
a
bill
an
if
we
had
the
telephone
right
now
we
could
call
up
folks
an
order
what
we
want
without
ever
budgin
out
of
our
tracks
go
up
ahead
katie
i
back
you
in
anything
you
can
think
of
it
wo
hurt
my
feelings
a
mite
if
you
can
think
of
one
or
two
things
the
rest
of
them
have
got
yet
ca
you
think
of
something
that
will
lay
the
rest
of
them
clear
in
the
shade
i
just
wish
you
could
now
i
going
to
bed
kate
went
with
her
mother
opened
her
bed
pulled
out
the
pins
and
brushed
her
hair
drew
the
thin
cover
over
her
and
blew
out
the
light
then
she
went
past
the
bed
on
her
way
to
the
door
and
stooping
she
kissed
her
mother
for
the
first
time
since
she
could
remember
then
she
lighted
a
lamp
hunted
a
big
sheet
of
wrapping
paper
and
sitting
down
beside
the
living
room
table
she
drew
a
rough
sketch
of
the
house
for
hours
she
pored
over
it
and
when
at
last
she
went
to
bed
on
the
reverse
of
the
sheet
she
had
a
drawing
that
was
quite
a
different
affair
yet
it
was
the
same
house
with
very
few
and
easily
made
changes
that
a
good
contractor
could
accomplish
in
a
short
time
in
the
morning
she
showed
these
ideas
to
her
mother
who
approved
all
of
them
but
still
showed
disappointment
visibly
that
nothing
but
all
the
rest
of
them
have
she
said
i
thought
you
could
think
up
some
frills
that
would
be
new
and
different
well
said
kate
would
you
want
to
go
to
the
expense
of
setting
up
a
furnace
in
the
cellar
it
would
make
the
whole
house
toasty
warm
it
would
keep
the
bathroom
from
freezing
in
cold
weather
and
make
a
better
way
to
heat
the
water
now
you
shouting
cried
bates
that
it
but
keep
still
do
you
tell
a
soul
about
it
but
go
on
and
do
it
katie
wade
right
in
what
else
can
you
think
of
a
brain
specialist
for
you
said
kate
i
think
myself
this
is
enough
for
a
start
but
if
you
insist
on
more
there
a
gas
line
passing
us
out
there
on
the
road
we
could
hitch
on
for
a
very
reasonable
sum
and
do
away
with
lamps
and
cooking
with
wood
goody
for
you
that
it
cried
bates
that
the
very
thing
now
brush
up
your
hair
your
prettiest
and
put
on
your
new
blue
dress
and
take
the
buggy
and
you
and
adam
go
see
how
much
of
this
can
be
started
me
and
polly
will
keep
house
in
a
month
all
of
these
changes
had
been
made
and
were
in
running
order
the
painting
was
finished
new
furniture
in
place
a
fair
start
made
on
the
garden
while
a
strong
young
hired
man
was
not
far
behind
hiram
with
his
plowing
kate
was
so
tired
she
almost
staggered
but
she
was
so
happy
she
arose
each
morning
refreshed
and
accomplished
work
enough
for
three
average
women
before
the
day
was
over
she
suggested
to
her
mother
that
she
use
her
money
from
the
sale
of
the
walden
home
to
pay
for
what
furniture
she
had
bought
and
then
none
of
the
others
could
feel
that
they
were
entitled
to
any
share
in
it
at
any
time
bates
thought
that
a
good
idea
so
much
ill
will
was
saved
among
the
children
they
all
stopped
in
passing
some
of
them
had
sharp
words
to
say
which
kate
instantly
answered
in
such
a
way
that
this
was
seldom
tried
twice
in
two
months
the
place
was
fresh
clean
convenient
and
in
good
taste
all
of
them
had
sufficient
suitable
clothing
while
the
farm
work
had
not
been
neglected
enough
to
hurt
the
value
of
the
crops
in
the
division
of
labour
adam
and
the
hired
man
took
the
barn
and
field
work
bates
and
polly
the
house
while
kate
threw
all
her
splendid
strength
wherever
it
was
most
needed
if
a
horse
was
sick
she
went
to
the
barn
and
doctored
it
if
the
hay
was
going
to
get
wet
she
pitched
hay
if
the
men
had
not
time
for
the
garden
she
attended
it
and
hoed
the
potatoes
for
a
change
everything
went
right
bates
was
happier
than
she
ever
had
been
before
taking
the
greatest
interest
in
the
children
they
had
lived
for
three
years
in
such
a
manner
that
they
would
never
forget
it
they
were
old
enough
to
appreciate
what
changes
had
come
to
them
and
to
be
very
keen
about
their
new
home
and
life
kate
threw
herself
into
the
dream
of
her
heart
with
all
the
zest
of
her
being
always
she
had
loved
and
wanted
land
now
she
had
it
she
knew
how
to
handle
it
she
could
make
it
pay
as
well
as
any
bates
man
for
she
had
man
strength
and
all
her
life
she
had
heard
men
discuss
and
helped
men
apply
man
methods
there
was
a
strong
strain
of
her
father
spirit
of
driving
in
blood
but
her
mother
was
so
tired
of
it
that
whenever
kate
had
gone
just
so
far
the
older
woman
had
merely
to
caution
now
now
katie
to
make
kate
realized
what
she
was
doing
and
take
a
slower
pace
all
of
them
were
well
happy
and
working
hard
but
they
also
played
at
proper
times
and
in
convenient
places
kate
and
her
mother
went
with
the
children
when
they
fished
in
the
meadow
brook
or
hunted
wild
flowers
in
the
woods
for
polly
bed
in
the
shade
of
the
pear
tree
beside
the
garden
there
were
flowers
in
the
garden
now
as
well
as
vegetables
there
was
no
work
done
on
sunday
the
children
always
went
to
and
the
full
term
of
the
district
school
at
bates
corners
they
were
respected
they
were
prosperous
they
were
finding
a
joy
in
life
they
never
before
had
known
while
life
had
taught
them
how
to
appreciate
its
good
things
as
they
achieved
them
the
first
christmas
bates
and
kate
made
a
christmas
tree
from
a
small
savine
in
the
dooryard
that
stood
where
kate
wanted
to
set
a
flowering
shrub
she
had
found
in
the
woods
guided
by
the
former
year
and
with
a
few
dollars
they
decided
to
spend
these
women
made
a
real
christmas
tree
with
gifts
and
ornaments
over
which
bates
was
much
more
excited
than
the
children
indeed
such
is
the
perversity
of
children
that
kate
eyes
widened
and
her
mouth
sagged
when
she
heard
adam
say
in
a
to
polly
this
is
mighty
pretty
but
gee
polly
there
never
be
another
tree
as
pretty
as
ours
last
year
while
polly
answered
i
was
just
thinking
about
it
adam
was
it
the
grandest
thing
the
next
christmas
bates
advanced
to
a
tree
that
reached
the
ceiling
with
many
candles
real
ornaments
and
an
orange
a
stocking
of
candy
and
nuts
and
a
doll
for
each
girl
and
a
knife
for
each
boy
of
her
grandchildren
all
of
whom
she
invited
for
dinner
adam
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
bates
at
the
foot
the
tiniest
tots
that
could
be
trusted
without
their
parents
ranged
on
the
dictionary
and
the
bible
of
which
the
bates
family
possessed
a
fat
edition
for
birth
records
no
one
had
ever
used
it
for
any
other
purpose
until
it
served
to
lift
hiram
baby
milly
on
a
level
with
her
roast
turkey
and
cranberry
jelly
for
a
year
before
her
party
bates
planned
for
it
the
tree
was
beautiful
the
gifts
amazing
the
dinner
as
kate
cooked
and
served
it
a
revelation
with
its
big
centre
basket
of
red
yellow
and
green
apples
oranges
bananas
grapes
and
flowers
none
of
them
ever
had
seen
a
table
like
that
then
when
dinner
was
over
kate
sat
before
the
fire
and
in
her
clear
voice
with
fine
inflections
she
read
from
the
big
book
the
story
of
the
guiding
star
and
the
little
child
in
the
manger
then
she
told
stories
and
they
played
games
until
four
and
then
adam
rolled
all
of
the
children
into
the
big
wagon
bed
mounted
on
the
sled
runners
and
took
them
home
then
he
came
back
and
finished
the
day
bates
could
scarcely
be
persuaded
to
go
to
bed
when
at
last
kate
went
to
put
out
her
mother
light
and
see
that
her
feet
were
warm
and
her
covers
tucked
she
found
her
crying
why
mother
exclaimed
kate
in
frank
dismay
was
everything
all
right
i
just
so
endurin
mad
sobbed
bates
that
i
could
scream
and
throw
things
here
i
am
closer
the
end
of
my
string
than
anybody
knows
likely
i
not
see
another
christmas
i
lived
the
most
of
my
life
and
never
knowed
there
was
a
time
like
that
on
earth
to
be
had
there
was
expense
to
it
we
could
easy
have
stood
always
now
at
the
end
of
my
tether
i
go
and
do
this
for
my
grandchildren
their
little
shining
faces
and
me
there
kept
coming
all
day
the
little
sad
disappointed
faces
of
you
and
nancy
ellen
and
mary
and
hannah
and
adam
and
andrew
and
hiram
and
all
the
others
ever
since
he
went
i
thought
the
one
thing
i
do
was
to
die
and
face
adam
bates
but
i
ai
felt
so
scared
of
him
seems
to
me
he
has
got
about
as
much
to
account
for
as
i
have
kate
stood
breathlessly
still
looking
at
her
mother
bates
wiped
her
eyes
i
ai
so
mortal
certain
she
said
that
i
do
open
up
on
him
and
take
the
first
word
i
think
likely
i
been
defrauded
out
of
more
that
really
counts
in
this
world
than
he
has
ai
that
little
of
hannah
too
sweet
seems
like
i
hardly
quit
feeling
her
little
sticky
hands
and
her
little
hot
mouth
on
my
face
when
i
die
and
as
she
went
out
she
whispered
in
my
ear
it
again
grandma
oh
please
do
it
again
an
it
likely
i
not
get
the
chance
no
matter
how
willing
i
am
kate
i
am
going
to
leave
you
what
of
my
money
is
left
i
have
spent
so
much
and
while
you
live
here
i
wish
each
year
you
would
have
this
same
kind
of
a
party
and
pay
for
it
out
of
that
money
and
call
it
party
will
you
i
surely
will
said
kate
and
had
i
better
have
all
of
them
and
put
some
little
thing
from
you
on
the
tree
for
them
you
know
how
hiram
always
was
wild
for
cuff
buttons
and
mary
could
talk
by
the
hour
about
a
handkerchief
with
lace
on
it
and
andrew
never
yet
has
got
that
copy
of
fables
he
always
wanted
shall
i
yes
said
bates
oh
yes
and
when
you
do
it
katie
if
they
do
chain
me
pretty
close
in
on
the
other
side
i
think
likely
be
sticking
around
as
near
as
i
can
get
to
you
kate
slipped
a
hot
brick
rolled
in
flannel
to
the
cold
old
feet
and
turning
out
the
light
she
sat
beside
the
bed
and
stroked
the
tired
head
until
easy
breathing
told
her
that
her
mother
was
sound
asleep
then
she
went
back
to
the
fireplace
and
sitting
in
the
red
glow
she
told
adam
part
of
what
her
mother
had
said
long
after
he
was
gone
she
sat
gazing
into
the
slowly
graying
coals
her
mind
busy
with
what
she
had
not
told
that
spring
was
difficult
for
kate
day
after
day
she
saw
her
mother
growing
older
feebler
and
frailer
and
as
the
body
failed
up
flamed
the
wings
of
the
spirit
carrying
her
on
and
on
each
day
keeping
her
alive
when
kate
did
not
see
how
it
could
be
done
with
all
the
force
she
could
gather
each
day
bates
struggled
to
keep
going
denied
that
she
felt
badly
drove
herself
to
try
to
help
about
the
house
and
garden
kate
warned
the
remainder
of
the
family
what
they
might
expect
at
any
hour
but
when
they
began
coming
in
oftener
bringing
little
gifts
and
being
unusually
kind
bates
endured
a
few
of
the
visits
in
silence
then
she
turned
to
kate
and
said
after
her
latest
callers
i
wonder
what
in
the
name
of
all
possessed
ails
the
folks
are
they
just
itching
to
start
my
funeral
ca
they
stay
away
until
you
send
them
word
that
the
breath
out
of
my
body
mother
you
shock
me
said
kate
they
come
because
they
love
you
they
try
to
tell
you
so
with
the
little
things
they
bring
most
people
would
think
they
were
neglected
if
their
children
did
not
come
to
see
them
when
they
were
not
so
well
not
so
well
cried
bates
folly
i
am
as
well
as
i
ever
was
they
need
come
snooping
around
trying
to
make
me
think
i
not
if
they
it
all
their
lives
well
and
good
it
no
time
for
them
to
begin
being
now
mother
said
kate
gently
have
you
changed
yourself
about
things
like
christmas
for
example
maybe
your
children
are
changing
too
maybe
they
feel
that
they
have
missed
something
they
like
to
have
from
you
and
give
back
to
you
before
it
too
late
just
maybe
said
kate
bates
sat
bolt
upright
still
but
her
flashing
eyes
softened
i
had
just
thought
of
that
she
said
i
think
it
more
than
likely
well
if
it
that
way
i
i
got
to
button
up
my
lip
and
stand
it
but
it
about
more
than
i
can
go
when
i
know
that
the
first
time
i
lose
my
grip
i
land
smash
up
against
adam
bates
and
my
settlement
with
him
mother
said
kate
still
more
gently
i
thought
we
had
it
settled
at
the
time
father
went
that
each
of
you
would
be
accountable
to
god
not
to
each
other
i
am
a
wanderer
in
darkness
myself
when
it
come
to
talking
about
god
but
this
i
know
he
is
somewhere
and
he
is
redeeming
love
if
father
has
been
in
the
light
of
his
love
all
these
years
he
must
have
changed
more
far
more
than
you
have
he
understand
now
how
wrong
he
was
to
force
ways
on
you
he
knew
you
did
think
right
he
have
more
to
account
to
you
for
than
you
ever
will
to
him
and
remember
this
only
neither
of
you
is
accountable
save
to
your
god
bates
arose
and
walked
to
the
door
drawn
to
full
height
her
head
very
erect
the
world
was
at
the
evening
air
was
heavily
sweet
with
lilacs
and
the
widely
branching
old
apple
trees
of
the
dooryard
with
loaded
with
flowers
she
stepped
outside
kate
followed
her
mother
went
down
the
steps
and
down
the
walk
to
the
gate
kate
kept
beside
her
in
reach
yet
not
touching
her
at
the
gate
she
gripped
the
pickets
to
steady
herself
as
she
stared
long
and
unflinchingly
at
the
red
setting
sun
dropping
behind
a
white
wall
of
bloom
then
she
slowly
turned
life
greatest
tragedy
lining
her
face
her
breath
coming
in
short
gasps
she
spread
her
hands
at
each
side
as
if
to
balance
herself
her
passing
soul
in
her
eyes
and
looked
at
kate
katherine
eleanor
she
said
slowly
and
distinctly
i
going
now
i
ca
fight
it
off
any
longer
i
confess
myself
i
burned
those
deeds
every
one
of
them
pa
got
himself
afire
but
he
thrown
them
out
of
it
it
was
my
chance
i
took
it
are
you
going
to
tell
them
kate
was
standing
as
tall
and
straight
as
her
mother
her
hands
extended
the
same
but
not
touching
her
no
she
said
you
were
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
god
to
right
a
great
wrong
no
i
shall
never
tell
a
soul
while
i
live
in
a
minute
god
himself
will
tell
you
that
you
did
what
he
willed
you
should
well
we
will
see
about
that
right
now
said
bates
lifting
her
face
to
the
sky
into
thy
hands
o
lord
into
thy
hands
then
she
closed
her
eyes
and
ceased
to
breathe
kate
took
her
into
her
arms
and
carried
her
to
her
bed
chapter
xxii
somewhat
of
polly
if
the
spirit
of
bates
hovered
among
the
apple
trees
as
her
mortal
remains
were
carried
past
the
lilacs
and
cabbage
rose
bushes
through
a
rain
of
drifting
petals
she
must
have
been
convinced
that
time
had
wrought
one
great
change
in
the
hearts
of
her
children
they
had
all
learned
to
weep
while
if
the
tears
they
shed
were
a
criterion
of
their
feelings
for
her
surely
her
soul
must
have
been
satisfied
they
laid
her
away
with
simple
ceremony
and
then
all
of
them
went
to
their
homes
except
nancy
ellen
and
robert
who
stopped
in
passing
to
learn
if
there
was
anything
they
could
do
for
kate
she
was
grieving
too
deeply
for
many
words
none
of
them
would
ever
understand
the
deep
bond
of
sympathy
and
companionship
that
had
grown
to
exist
between
her
and
her
mother
she
stopped
at
the
front
porch
and
sat
down
feeling
unable
to
enter
the
house
with
nancy
ellen
who
was
deeply
concerned
over
the
lack
of
taste
displayed
in
agatha
new
spring
hat
when
kate
could
endure
it
no
longer
she
interrupted
why
did
all
of
them
come
what
for
asked
nancy
ellen
they
had
a
right
to
know
what
mother
had
done
said
kate
in
a
low
voice
but
what
was
the
use
asked
nancy
ellen
adam
had
been
managing
the
administrator
business
for
mother
and
paying
her
taxes
with
his
of
course
when
she
made
a
deed
to
you
and
had
it
recorded
they
told
him
all
of
us
knew
it
for
two
years
before
she
went
after
you
and
the
new
furniture
was
bought
with
your
money
so
it
yours
what
was
there
to
have
a
meeting
about
mother
did
understand
that
you
children
knew
said
kate
sometimes
i
thought
there
were
a
lot
of
things
mother
understand
said
nancy
ellen
and
sometimes
i
thought
she
understood
so
much
more
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
that
all
of
us
would
have
had
a
big
surprise
if
we
could
have
seen
her
brain
yes
i
believe
we
would
said
kate
do
you
mind
telling
me
how
the
boys
and
girls
feel
about
this
nancy
ellen
laughed
shortly
well
the
boys
feel
that
you
negotiated
such
a
fine
settlement
of
father
affairs
for
them
that
they
owe
this
to
you
the
girls
were
pretty
sore
at
first
and
some
of
them
are
nursing
their
wrath
yet
but
there
was
a
thing
on
earth
they
could
do
all
of
them
were
perfectly
willing
that
you
should
have
something
after
the
fire
of
course
most
of
them
thought
mother
went
too
far
i
think
so
myself
said
kate
but
she
never
came
near
me
or
wrote
me
or
sent
me
even
one
word
until
the
day
she
came
after
me
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
all
of
us
know
that
kate
said
nancy
ellen
you
need
worry
we
all
used
to
it
and
we
all
at
the
place
where
we
have
nothing
to
say
to
escape
grieving
for
her
mother
kate
worked
that
summer
as
never
before
adam
was
growing
big
enough
and
strong
enough
to
be
a
real
help
he
was
interested
in
all
they
did
always
after
the
reason
and
trying
to
think
of
a
better
way
kate
secured
the
best
agricultural
paper
for
him
and
they
read
it
nights
together
they
kept
an
account
book
and
set
down
all
they
spent
and
balanced
against
it
all
they
earned
putting
the
difference
which
was
often
more
than
they
hoped
for
in
the
bank
so
the
years
ran
as
the
children
grew
older
polly
discovered
that
the
nicest
boy
in
school
lived
across
the
road
half
a
mile
north
of
them
while
adam
after
a
real
struggle
in
his
loyal
twin
soul
aided
by
the
fact
that
henry
peters
usually
had
divided
his
apples
with
polly
before
adam
reached
her
discovered
that
milly
york
across
the
road
half
a
mile
south
liked
his
apples
best
and
was
as
nice
a
girl
as
polly
ever
dared
to
be
in
a
dazed
way
kate
learned
these
things
from
their
and
sunday
talk
saw
that
they
nearly
reached
her
shoulder
and
realized
that
they
were
sixteen
so
quickly
the
time
goes
when
people
are
busy
happy
and
working
together
at
least
kate
and
adam
were
happy
for
they
were
always
working
together
by
tacit
agreement
they
left
polly
the
easy
housework
and
went
themselves
to
the
fields
to
wrestle
with
the
rugged
work
of
a
farm
they
thought
they
were
shielding
polly
teaching
her
a
woman
real
work
and
being
kind
to
her
polly
thought
they
were
together
because
they
liked
to
be
doing
the
farm
work
because
it
suited
them
better
while
she
had
known
from
babyhood
that
for
some
reason
her
mother
did
not
care
for
her
as
she
did
for
adam
she
thought
at
first
that
it
was
because
adam
was
a
boy
later
when
she
noticed
her
mother
watching
her
every
time
she
started
to
speak
and
interrupting
with
the
caution
now
be
careful
think
before
you
speak
are
you
sure
she
wondered
why
this
should
happen
to
her
always
to
adam
never
she
asked
adam
about
it
but
adam
did
not
know
it
never
occurred
to
polly
to
ask
her
mother
while
kate
was
so
uneasy
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
the
child
would
notice
or
what
she
would
think
the
first
time
polly
deviated
slightly
from
the
truth
she
and
kate
had
a
very
terrible
time
kate
felt
fully
justified
the
child
astonished
and
abused
polly
arrived
at
the
solution
of
her
problem
slowly
as
she
grew
older
she
saw
that
her
mother
who
always
was
charitable
to
everyone
else
was
repelled
by
her
grandmother
while
she
loved
aunt
ollie
older
still
polly
realized
that
she
was
a
reproduction
of
her
grandmother
she
had
only
to
look
at
her
to
see
this
her
mother
did
not
like
her
grandmother
maybe
mother
did
not
like
her
as
well
as
adam
because
she
resembled
her
grandmother
by
the
time
she
was
sixteen
polly
had
arrived
at
a
solution
that
satisfied
her
as
to
why
her
mother
liked
adam
better
and
always
left
her
alone
in
the
house
to
endless
cooking
dishwashing
sweeping
dusting
washing
and
ironing
while
she
hoed
potatoes
pitched
hay
or
sheared
sheep
polly
thought
the
nicer
way
would
have
been
to
do
the
housework
together
and
then
go
to
the
fields
together
but
she
was
a
good
soul
so
she
worked
alone
and
brooded
in
silence
and
watched
up
the
road
for
a
glimpse
of
henry
peters
who
liked
to
hear
her
talk
and
to
whom
it
mattered
not
a
mite
that
her
hair
was
lustreless
her
eyes
steel
coloured
and
her
nose
like
that
of
a
woman
he
never
had
seen
in
her
way
polly
admired
her
mother
loved
her
and
worked
until
she
was
almost
dropping
for
scant
infrequent
words
of
praise
so
polly
had
to
be
content
in
the
kitchen
one
day
having
finished
her
work
two
hours
before
dinnertime
she
sauntered
to
the
front
gate
how
strange
that
henry
peters
should
be
at
the
end
of
the
field
joining
their
land
when
he
waved
she
waved
back
when
he
climbed
the
fence
she
opened
the
gate
they
met
halfway
under
the
bloomful
shade
of
a
red
haw
henry
wondered
who
two
men
he
had
seen
leaving
the
holt
gate
were
and
what
they
wanted
but
he
was
too
polite
to
ask
he
merely
hoped
they
did
not
annoy
her
oh
no
they
were
only
some
men
to
see
mother
about
some
business
but
it
was
most
kind
of
him
to
let
her
know
he
was
looking
out
for
her
she
got
so
lonely
mother
never
would
let
her
go
to
the
field
with
her
of
course
not
the
field
was
no
place
for
such
a
pretty
girl
there
was
enough
work
in
the
house
for
her
his
sister
should
not
work
in
the
field
if
he
had
a
sister
and
polly
should
not
work
there
if
she
belonged
to
him
polly
looked
at
henry
with
shining
young
girl
eyes
and
when
he
said
she
was
pretty
her
eyes
softened
her
cheeks
pinked
up
the
sun
put
light
in
her
hair
nature
had
failed
to
and
lo
and
behold
the
marvel
was
wrought
plain
little
polly
became
a
thing
of
beauty
she
knew
it
instantly
because
she
saw
herself
in
henry
peters
eyes
and
henry
was
so
amazed
when
this
wonderful
transformation
took
place
in
little
polly
right
there
under
the
red
haw
tree
that
his
own
eyes
grew
big
and
tender
his
cheeks
flooded
with
red
blood
his
heart
shook
him
and
he
drew
to
full
height
and
became
possessed
of
an
overwhelming
desire
to
dance
before
polly
and
sing
to
her
he
grew
so
splendid
polly
caught
her
breath
and
then
she
smiled
on
him
a
very
wondering
smile
over
the
great
discovery
and
henry
grew
so
bewildered
he
forgot
either
to
dance
or
sing
as
a
preliminary
he
merely
just
merely
reached
out
and
gathered
polly
in
his
arms
and
held
her
against
him
and
stared
down
at
her
wonderful
beauty
opening
right
out
under
his
eyes
little
beautiful
said
henry
peters
in
a
hushed
choking
voice
little
beautiful
polly
looked
up
at
him
she
was
every
bit
as
beautiful
as
he
thought
her
while
he
was
so
beautiful
to
polly
that
she
gasped
for
breath
how
did
he
happen
to
look
as
he
did
right
under
the
red
haw
in
broad
daylight
he
had
been
hers
of
course
ever
since
shy
and
fearful
she
had
first
entered
bates
corners
school
and
found
courage
in
his
broad
encouraging
smile
now
she
smiled
on
him
the
smile
of
possession
that
was
in
her
heart
henry
instantly
knew
she
always
had
belonged
to
him
so
he
grasped
her
closer
and
bent
his
head
when
henry
went
back
to
the
plow
and
polly
ran
down
the
road
with
the
joy
of
the
world
surging
in
her
heart
and
brain
she
knew
that
she
was
going
to
have
to
account
to
her
tired
busy
mother
for
being
half
an
hour
late
with
dinner
and
he
knew
he
was
going
to
have
to
explain
to
an
equally
tired
father
why
he
was
four
furrows
short
of
where
he
should
be
he
came
to
book
first
and
told
the
truth
he
had
seen
some
men
go
to
the
holts
polly
was
his
little
chum
and
she
was
always
alone
all
summer
so
he
just
walked
that
way
to
be
sure
she
was
safe
his
father
looked
at
him
quizzically
so
that
the
way
the
wind
blows
he
said
well
i
do
know
where
you
could
find
a
nicer
little
girl
or
a
better
worker
i
always
hoped
you
take
to
milly
york
but
polly
is
better
she
can
work
three
of
milly
down
awful
plain
though
this
sacrilege
came
while
henry
lips
were
tingling
with
their
first
kiss
and
his
heart
was
drunken
with
the
red
wine
of
innocent
young
love
why
dad
you
crazy
he
cried
there
is
another
girl
in
the
whole
world
as
pretty
and
sweet
as
polly
milly
york
she
ca
hold
a
candle
to
polly
besides
she
been
adam
as
long
as
polly
has
been
mine
god
bless
my
soul
cried
peters
how
these
youngsters
to
run
away
with
us
and
are
you
the
most
beautiful
young
man
at
bates
corners
henry
i
beautiful
enough
that
polly
will
put
her
arms
around
my
neck
and
kiss
me
anyway
blurted
henry
so
you
and
ma
can
get
ready
for
a
wedding
as
soon
as
polly
says
the
word
i
ready
right
now
so
am
i
said
peters
and
from
the
way
ma
complains
about
the
work
i
and
you
boys
make
her
i
do
think
she
will
object
to
a
little
help
polly
is
a
good
steady
worker
polly
ran
but
she
simply
could
not
light
the
fire
set
the
table
and
get
things
cooked
on
time
while
everything
she
touched
seemed
to
spill
or
slip
she
could
not
think
what
or
how
to
do
the
usual
for
the
very
good
reason
that
henry
peters
was
a
prince
and
a
knight
and
a
lover
and
a
sweetheart
and
her
man
she
had
just
agreed
to
all
this
with
her
soul
less
than
an
hour
ago
under
the
red
haw
no
wonder
she
was
late
no
wonder
she
spilled
and
smeared
and
red
of
face
she
blundered
and
bungled
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
then
in
came
kate
she
must
lose
no
time
the
corn
must
be
finished
before
it
rained
she
must
hurry
for
the
first
time
dinner
was
late
while
polly
was
messing
like
a
perfect
little
fool
kate
stepped
in
and
began
to
right
things
with
practised
hand
disaster
came
when
she
saw
polly
at
the
well
take
an
instant
from
bringing
in
the
water
to
wave
in
the
direction
of
the
peters
farm
as
she
entered
the
door
kate
swept
her
with
a
glance
have
to
upset
the
bowl
as
usual
she
said
scathingly
just
as
i
think
you
going
to
make
something
of
yourself
and
be
of
some
use
you
begin
mooning
in
the
direction
of
that
big
gangling
hank
peters
do
you
ever
let
me
see
you
do
it
again
you
are
too
young
to
start
that
kind
of
foolishness
i
bet
a
cow
he
was
hanging
around
here
and
made
you
late
with
dinner
he
was
not
he
did
either
cried
polly
then
stopped
in
dismay
her
cheeks
burning
she
gulped
and
went
on
bravely
that
is
he
was
here
and
he
did
make
me
late
any
more
than
i
kept
him
from
his
work
he
always
watches
when
there
are
tramps
and
peddlers
on
the
road
because
he
knows
i
alone
i
knew
he
would
be
watching
two
men
who
stopped
to
see
you
so
i
just
went
as
far
as
the
haw
tree
to
tell
him
i
was
all
right
and
we
got
to
talking
if
only
kate
had
been
looking
at
polly
then
but
she
was
putting
the
apple
butter
and
cream
on
the
table
as
she
did
so
she
thought
possibly
it
was
a
good
idea
to
have
henry
peters
seeing
that
tramps
did
not
frighten
polly
so
she
missed
dawn
on
the
face
of
her
child
and
instead
of
what
might
have
been
she
said
well
i
must
say
that
is
neighbourly
of
him
but
do
you
dare
let
him
get
any
foolish
notions
in
his
head
i
think
aunt
nancy
ellen
will
let
you
stay
at
her
house
after
this
and
go
to
the
hartley
high
school
in
winter
so
you
can
come
out
of
that
much
better
prepared
to
teach
than
i
ever
was
i
had
a
surprise
planned
for
you
but
now
i
do
know
whether
you
deserve
it
or
not
i
have
to
think
kate
did
not
think
at
all
after
the
manner
of
parents
she
said
that
but
her
head
was
full
of
something
she
thought
vastly
more
important
just
then
of
course
polly
should
have
her
share
in
it
left
alone
to
wash
the
dishes
and
cook
supper
while
her
mother
went
to
town
it
was
polly
who
did
the
thinking
she
thought
entirely
too
much
thought
bitterly
thought
disappointedly
and
finally
thought
resentfully
and
then
alas
polly
thought
deceitfully
her
mother
had
said
never
let
me
see
you
very
well
she
would
be
extremely
careful
that
she
was
not
seen
but
before
she
slept
she
rather
thought
she
would
find
a
way
to
let
henry
know
how
she
was
being
abused
and
about
that
plan
to
send
her
away
all
the
long
winter
to
school
she
rather
thought
henry
would
have
something
to
say
about
how
his
little
beautiful
was
being
treated
here
polly
looked
long
and
searchingly
in
the
mirror
to
see
if
by
any
chance
henry
was
mistaken
and
she
discovered
he
was
she
stared
in
amazement
at
the
shining
eyed
girl
she
saw
mirrored
she
pulled
her
hair
looser
around
the
temples
and
drew
her
lips
over
her
teeth
surely
henry
was
mistaken
little
beautiful
was
too
moderate
she
would
see
that
he
said
perfectly
lovely
the
next
time
and
he
did
chapter
xxiii
kate
heavenly
time
one
evening
kate
and
polly
went
to
the
front
porch
to
rest
until
bedtime
and
found
a
shining
big
new
trunk
sitting
there
with
initials
on
the
end
her
name
on
the
check
tag
and
a
key
in
the
lock
they
unbuckled
the
straps
turned
the
key
and
lifted
the
lid
that
trunk
contained
underclothing
hose
shoes
two
hats
a
travelling
dress
with
half
a
dozen
extra
waists
and
an
afternoon
and
an
evening
dress
all
selected
with
especial
reference
to
kate
colouring
and
made
one
size
larger
than
nancy
ellen
wore
which
fitted
kate
perfectly
there
were
gloves
a
parasol
and
a
note
which
read
dear
kate
here
are
some
clothes
i
am
going
to
go
north
a
week
after
harvest
you
can
be
spared
then
as
well
as
not
come
on
let
run
away
and
have
one
good
time
all
by
ourselves
it
is
my
treat
from
start
to
finish
the
children

manage
the
farm
perfectly
well
any
one
of
her
cousins
will
stay
with
polly
if
she
will
be
lonely
cut
loose
and
come
on
kate
i
am
going
of
course
robert
could
be
pried
away
from
his
precious
patients
we
will
have
to
go
alone
but
we
do
not
care
we
like
it
shall
we
start
about
the
tenth
on
the
night
train
which
will
be
cooler
nancy
ellen
we
shall
said
kate
emphatically
when
she
finished
the
note
i
have
cut
loose
and
had
a
good
time
since
i
was
married
not
for
eighteen
years
if
the
children
are
not
big
enough
to
take
care
of
themselves
they
never
will
be
i
can
go
as
well
as
not
she
handed
the
note
to
polly
while
she
shook
out
dresses
and
gloated
over
the
contents
of
the
trunk
of
course
you
shall
go
shouted
polly
as
she
finished
the
note
but
even
as
she
said
it
she
glanced
obliquely
up
the
road
and
waved
a
hand
behind
her
mother
back
sure
you
shall
go
cried
adam
when
he
finished
the
note
and
sat
beside
the
trunk
seeing
all
the
pretty
things
over
again
you
just
bet
you
shall
go
polly
and
i
can
keep
house
fine
we
do
need
any
cousins
hanging
around
i
help
polly
with
her
work
and
then
lock
the
house
and
she
can
come
out
with
me
sure
you
go
we
do
all
right
then
he
glanced
obliquely
down
the
road
where
a
slim
little
figure
in
white
moved
under
the
cherry
trees
of
the
york
front
yard
aimlessly
knocking
croquet
balls
here
and
there
it
was
two
weeks
until
time
to
go
but
kate
began
taking
care
of
herself
at
once
solely
because
she
did
not
want
nancy
ellen
to
be
ashamed
of
her
she
rolled
her
sleeves
down
to
meet
her
gloves
and
used
a
sunbonnet
instead
of
a
sunshade
she
washed
and
brushed
her
hair
with
care
she
had
not
used
in
years
by
the
time
the
tenth
of
july
came
she
was
in
very
presentable
condition
while
the
contents
of
the
trunk
did
the
remainder
as
she
was
getting
ready
to
go
she
said
to
polly
now
do
your
best
while
i
away
and
i
am
sure
i
can
arrange
with
nancy
ellen
about
school
this
winter
when
i
get
back
the
very
first
thing
i
shall
do
will
be
to
go
to
hartley
and
buy
some
stuff
to
begin
on
your
clothes
you
shall
have
as
nice
dresses
as
the
other
girls
too
nancy
ellen
will
know
exactly
what
to
get
you
but
she
never
caught
a
glimpse
of
polly
flushed
dissatisfied
face
or
the
tightening
of
her
lips
that
would
have
suggested
to
her
had
she
seen
them
that
miss
polly
felt
perfectly
capable
of
selecting
the
clothing
she
was
to
wear
herself
adam
took
his
mother
trunk
to
the
station
in
the
afternoon
in
the
evening
she
held
polly
on
her
knee
while
they
drove
to
gray
kate
thought
the
children
would
want
to
wait
and
see
them
take
the
train
but
adam
said
that
would
make
them
very
late
getting
home
they
had
better
leave
that
to
uncle
robert
and
go
back
soon
so
very
soon
they
were
duly
kissed
and
unduly
cautioned
then
started
back
down
a
side
street
that
would
not
even
take
them
through
the
heart
of
the
town
kate
looked
after
them
approvingly
pretty
good
youngsters
she
said
i
told
them
to
go
and
get
some
ice
cream
but
you
see
they
are
saving
the
money
and
heading
straight
home
she
turned
to
robert
can
anything
happen
to
them
she
asked
in
evident
anxiety
rest
in
peace
kate
laughed
the
doctor
you
surely
know
that
those
youngsters
are
going
to
be
eighteen
in
a
few
weeks
you
reared
them
carefully
nothing
can
or
will
happen
to
them
that
would
not
happen
right
under
your
nose
if
you
were
at
home
they
will
go
from
now
on
according
to
their
inclinations
kate
looked
at
him
sharply
what
do
you
mean
by
that
she
demanded
he
laughed
nothing
serious
he
said
polly
is
half
bates
so
she
will
marry
in
a
year
or
two
while
adam
is
all
bates
so
he
will
remain
steady
as
the
rock
of
ages
and
strictly
on
the
job
go
have
your
good
time
and
if
i
possibly
can
i
come
after
you
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
nancy
ellen
with
finality
you
would
leave
your
patients
and
you
could
leave
dear
mrs
southey
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
why
do
you
leave
me
he
asked
to
show
the
little
fool
i
not
afraid
of
her
for
one
thing
said
nancy
ellen
with
her
head
high
she
was
very
beautiful
in
her
smart
travelling
dress
while
her
eyes
flashed
as
she
spoke
the
doctor
looked
at
her
approvingly
good
he
cried
i
like
a
plucky
woman
go
to
have
a
good
time
nancy
ellen
but
do
go
for
that
i
do
wish
you
would
believe
that
there
is
a
thing
the
matter
with
the
little
woman
she
i
can
go
even
farther
than
that
said
nancy
ellen
dryly
i
know
is
a
thing
the
matter
with
the
little
woman
except
that
she
wants
you
to
look
as
if
you
were
running
after
her
i
be
safe
in
wagering
a
thousand
dollars
that
when
she
hears
i
gone
she
will
send
for
you
before
evening
you
may
also
wager
this
he
said
if
she
does
i
shall
be
very
sorry
but
i
on
my
way
to
the
country
on
an
emergency
call
nancy
ellen
i
wish
you
would
would
go
north
or
would
see
what
every
other
living
soul
in
hartley
sees
she
asked
curtly
then
she
stepped
inside
to
put
on
her
hat
and
gloves
kate
looked
at
the
doctor
in
dismay
oh
robert
she
said
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
kate
he
said
if
nancy
ellen
only
would
be
reasonable
the
woman
would
see
shortly
that
my
wife
is
all
the
world
to
me
i
never
have
been
and
never
shall
be
untrue
to
her
does
that
satisfy
you
of
course
said
kate
i
do
all
in
my
power
to
talk
nancy
ellen
out
of
that
on
this
trip
oh
if
she
only
had
children
to
occupy
her
time
that
the
whole
trouble
in
a
nutshell
said
the
doctor
but
you
know
there
is
a
scarcity
of
children
in
the
world
never
a
day
passes
but
i
see
half
a
dozen
who
need
me
sorely
but
with
nancy
ellen
no
child
will
do
unless
she
mothers
it
and
unfortunately
none
comes
to
her
too
bad
said
kate
i
so
sorry
cheer
her
up
if
you
can
said
the
doctor
an
hour
later
they
were
speeding
north
nancy
ellen
moody
and
distraught
kate
as
frankly
delighted
as
any
child
the
spring
work
was
over
the
crops
were
fine
adam
would
surely
have
the
premium
wheat
to
take
to
the
county
fair
in
september
he
would
work
unceasingly
for
his
chance
with
corn
he
and
polly
would
be
all
right
she
could
see
polly
waiting
in
the
stable
yard
while
adam
unharnessed
and
turned
out
the
horse
kate
kept
watching
nancy
ellen
discontented
face
at
last
she
said
cheer
up
child
there
is
a
word
of
truth
in
it
i
know
it
said
nancy
ellen
then
why
take
the
way
of
all
the
world
to
start
and
keep
people
talking
asked
kate
i
not
doing
a
thing
on
earth
but
attending
strictly
to
my
own
business
said
nancy
ellen
that
exactly
the
trouble
said
kate
you
not
you
let
the
little
heifer
have
things
all
her
own
way
if
it
were
my
man
and
i
loved
him
as
you
do
robert
gray
you
can
stake
your
life
i
should
be
doing
something
several
things
in
fact
this
is
interesting
said
nancy
ellen
for
example
kate
had
not
given
such
a
matter
a
thought
she
looked
from
the
window
a
minute
her
lips
firmly
compressed
then
she
spoke
slowly
well
for
one
thing
i
should
become
that
woman
bosom
companion
about
seven
times
a
week
i
should
uncover
her
most
aggravating
weakness
all
unintentionally
before
the
man
in
the
case
at
the
same
time
keeping
myself
strictly
myself
i
should
keep
steadily
on
doing
and
being
what
he
first
fell
in
love
with
lastly
since
eighteen
years
have
brought
you
no
fulfillment
of
the
desire
of
your
heart
i
should
give
it
up
and
content
myself
and
delight
him
by
taking
into
my
heart
and
home
a
couple
of
the
most
attractive
tiny
babies
i
could
find
two
are
scarcely
more
trouble
than
one
you
can
have
all
the
help
you
will
accept
the
children
would
never
know
the
difference
if
you
took
them
as
babies
and
soon
you
would
either
while
robert
would
be
delighted
if
i
were
you
i
give
myself
something
to
work
for
besides
myself
and
i
give
him
so
much
to
think
about
at
home
that
charming
young
grass
widows
could
go
to
grass
i
believe
you
would
said
nancy
ellen
wonderingly
i
believe
you
would
you
might
right
i
would
said
kate
if
i
were
married
to
a
man
like
robert
gray
i
fight
tooth
and
nail
before
i
let
him
fall
below
his
high
ideals
it
as
much
your
job
to
keep
him
up
as
it
is
his
to
keep
himself
if
god
did
make
him
a
father
i
would
and
keep
him
busy
on
the
job
if
i
had
to
adopt
sixteen
nancy
ellen
laughed
as
they
went
to
their
berths
the
next
morning
they
awakened
in
cool
michigan
country
and
went
speeding
north
among
evergreen
forests
and
clear
lakes
mirroring
the
pointed
forest
tops
and
blue
sky
past
slashing
splashing
streams
in
which
they
could
almost
see
the
speckled
trout
darting
over
the
beds
of
white
sand
by
late
afternoon
they
had
reached
their
destination
and
were
in
their
rooms
bathed
dressed
and
ready
for
the
dinner
hour
in
the
evening
they
went
walking
coming
back
to
the
hotel
tired
and
happy
after
several
days
they
began
talking
to
people
and
making
friends
going
out
in
fishing
and
boating
parties
in
the
morning
driving
or
boating
in
the
afternoon
and
attending
concerts
or
dances
at
night
kate
did
not
dance
but
she
loved
to
see
nancy
ellen
when
she
had
a
sufficiently
tall
graceful
partner
while
as
she
watched
the
young
people
and
thought
how
innocent
and
happy
they
seemed
she
asked
her
sister
if
they
could
not
possibly
arrange
for
adam
and
polly
to
go
to
hartley
a
night
or
two
a
week
that
winter
and
join
the
dancing
class
nancy
ellen
was
frankly
delighted
so
kate
cautiously
skirted
the
school
question
in
such
a
manner
that
she
soon
had
nancy
ellen
asking
if
it
could
not
be
arranged
when
that
was
decided
nancy
ellen
went
to
dance
while
kate
stood
on
the
veranda
watching
her
the
lights
from
the
window
fell
strongly
on
kate
she
was
wearing
her
evening
dress
of
smoky
gray
soft
fabric
over
shining
silk
with
knots
of
dull
blue
velvet
and
gold
lace
here
and
there
she
had
dressed
her
hair
carefully
she
appeared
what
she
was
a
splendid
specimen
of
healthy
vigorous
clean
womanhood
pardon
me
holt
said
a
voice
at
her
elbow
but
there
only
one
head
in
this
world
like
yours
so
this
of
course
must
be
you
kate
heart
leaped
and
stood
still
she
turned
slowly
then
held
out
her
hand
smiling
at
john
jardine
but
saying
not
a
word
he
took
her
hand
and
as
he
gripped
it
tightly
he
studied
her
frankly
thank
god
for
this
he
said
fervently
for
years
i
dreamed
of
you
and
hungered
for
the
sight
of
your
face
but
you
cut
me
off
squarely
so
i
dared
not
intrude
on
you
only
the
lord
knows
how
delighted
i
am
to
see
you
here
looking
like
this
kate
smiled
again
come
away
he
begged
come
out
of
this
come
walk
a
little
way
with
me
and
tell
me
who
you
are
and
how
you
are
and
all
the
things
i
think
of
every
day
of
my
life
and
now
i
must
know
it
brigandage
come
or
i
shall
carry
you
pooh
you
could
laughed
kate
of
course
i
come
and
i
do
own
a
secret
ask
anything
you
want
to
know
how
good
it
is
to
see
you
your
mother
at
rest
years
ago
he
said
she
never
forgave
me
for
what
i
did
in
the
way
i
did
it
she
said
it
would
bring
disaster
and
she
was
right
i
thought
it
was
not
fair
and
honest
not
to
let
you
know
the
worst
i
thought
i
was
too
old
and
too
busy
and
too
flourishing
to
repair
neglected
years
at
that
date
but
believe
me
kate
you
waked
me
up
try
the
hardest
one
you
know
and
if
i
ca
spell
it
i
pay
a
thousand
to
your
pet
charity
kate
laughed
spontaneously
are
you
in
earnest
she
asked
i
am
incomprehensibly
immeasurably
in
earnest
he
said
guiding
her
down
a
narrow
path
to
a
platform
built
on
the
steep
side
of
a
high
hill
where
they
faced
the
waves
rolling
softly
in
a
dancing
procession
across
the
face
of
the
great
inland
sea
here
he
found
a
seat
i
nothing
to
tell
he
said
i
lost
mother
so
i
went
on
without
her
i
learned
to
spell
and
a
great
many
other
things
and
i
still
making
money
i
never
forget
you
for
a
day
i
never
have
loved
and
never
shall
love
any
other
woman
that
all
about
me
in
a
nutshell
now
go
on
and
tell
me
a
volume
tell
me
all
night
about
you
heavens
woman
i
wish
you
could
see
yourself
in
that
dress
with
the
moon
on
your
hair
kate
you
are
the
superbest
thing
i
always
shall
be
mad
about
you
oh
if
only
you
could
have
had
a
little
patience
with
me
i
thought
i
could
learn
but
of
course
i
could
but
proceed
i
must
let
myself
go
kate
leaned
back
and
looked
a
long
time
at
the
shining
white
waves
and
the
deep
blue
sky
then
she
turned
to
john
jardine
and
began
to
talk
she
told
him
simply
a
few
of
the
most
presentable
details
of
her
life
how
she
had
lost
her
money
then
had
been
given
her
mother
farm
about
the
children
and
how
she
now
lived
he
listened
with
deep
interest
often
interrupting
to
ask
a
question
and
when
she
ceased
talking
he
said
half
under
his
breath
and
you
now
free
oh
the
wonder
of
it
you
now
free
kate
had
that
night
to
think
about
the
remainder
of
her
life
she
always
sincerely
hoped
that
the
moonlight
did
not
bewitch
her
into
leading
the
man
beside
her
into
saying
things
he
seemed
to
take
delight
in
saying
she
had
no
idea
what
time
it
was
in
fact
she
did
not
care
even
what
nancy
ellen
thought
or
whether
she
would
worry
the
night
was
wonderful
john
jardine
had
now
made
a
man
of
himself
worthy
of
all
consideration
being
made
love
to
by
him
was
enchanting
she
had
been
occupied
with
the
stern
business
of
daily
bread
for
so
long
that
to
be
again
clothed
as
other
women
and
frankly
adored
by
such
a
man
as
john
jardine
was
soul
satisfying
what
did
she
care
who
worried
or
what
time
it
was
but
i
keeping
you
here
until
you
will
be
wet
with
these
mists
john
jardine
cried
at
last
forgive
me
kate
i
never
did
have
any
sense
where
you
were
concerned
i
take
you
back
now
but
you
must
promise
me
to
meet
me
here
in
the
morning
say
at
ten
i
take
you
back
now
if
you
agree
to
that
there
no
reason
why
i
should
said
kate
and
you
free
free
he
repeated
the
veranda
halls
and
ballroom
were
deserted
when
they
returned
to
the
hotel
as
kate
entered
her
room
nancy
ellen
sat
up
in
bed
and
stared
at
her
sleepily
but
she
was
laughing
in
high
good
humour
she
drew
her
watch
from
under
her
pillow
and
looked
at
it
goodness
gracious
miss
she
cried
do
you
know
it
almost
three
i
do
care
in
the
least
said
kate
if
it
four
or
five
i
had
a
perfectly
heavenly
time
do
talk
to
me
i
put
out
the
light
and
be
quiet
as
soon
as
i
get
my
dress
off
i
think
likely
i
ruined
it
what
the
difference
demanded
nancy
ellen
largely
you
can
ruin
half
a
dozen
a
day
now
if
you
want
to
what
do
you
mean
asked
kate
laughed
nancy
ellen
i
mean
that
i
saw
john
jardine
or
his
ghost
come
up
to
you
on
the
veranda
looking
as
if
he
eat
you
alive
and
carry
you
away
about
nine
and
you
been
gone
six
hours
and
come
back
having
had
a
heavenly
time
what
should
i
mean
go
up
head
kate
you
have
earned
your
right
to
a
good
time
it
is
everybody
who
gets
a
second
chance
in
this
world
tell
me
one
thing
and
i
go
to
sleep
in
peace
and
leave
you
to
moon
the
remainder
of
the
night
if
you
like
did
he
say
he
still
loved
you
still
and
yet
laughed
kate
as
i
remember
his
exact
words
were
that
he
had
loved
and
never
would
love
any
other
woman
now
are
you
satisfied
nancy
ellen
sprang
from
the
bed
and
ran
to
kate
gathering
her
in
her
strong
arms
she
hugged
and
kissed
her
ecstatically
good
good
oh
you
darling
she
cried
there
be
nothing
in
the
world
you
ca
have
i
just
know
he
had
gone
on
making
money
he
was
crazy
about
you
oh
kate
this
is
too
good
how
did
i
ever
think
of
coming
here
and
why
did
i
think
of
it
seven
years
ago
kate
you
must
promise
me
you
marry
him
before
i
let
you
go
i
promise
to
think
about
it
said
kate
trying
to
free
herself
for
despite
the
circumstances
and
the
hour
her
mind
flew
back
to
a
thousand
times
when
only
one
kind
word
from
nancy
ellen
would
have
saved
her
endless
pain
it
was
endless
for
it
was
burning
in
her
heart
that
instant
at
the
prospect
of
wealth
position
and
power
nancy
ellen
could
smother
her
with
caresses
but
poverty
pain
and
disgrace
she
had
endured
alone
i
sha
let
you
go
till
you
promise
threatened
nancy
ellen
when
are
you
to
see
him
again
ten
this
morning
said
kate
you
better
let
me
get
to
bed
or
look
a
sight
then
promise
said
nancy
ellen
kate
laid
firm
hands
on
the
encircling
arms
now
look
here
she
said
shortly
it
about
time
to
stop
this
nonsense
there
nothing
i
can
promise
you
i
must
have
time
to
think
i
got
not
only
myself
but
the
children
to
think
for
and
i
only
got
till
ten
so
i
better
get
at
it
kate
tone
made
nancy
ellen
step
back
kate
you
have
still
got
that
letter
in
your
mind
have
you
she
demanded
no
laughed
kate
i
have
he
offered
me
a
thousand
dollars
if
i
could
pronounce
him
a
word
he
could
spell
and
it
perfectly
evident
he
studied
until
he
is
exactly
like
anybody
else
no
not
that
then
what
is
it
simpleton
there
was
nothing
else
cried
nancy
ellen
not
so
much
at
that
time
but
this
is
nearly
twenty
years
later
and
i
have
the
fate
of
my
children
in
my
hands
i
wish
you
go
to
bed
and
let
me
think
said
kate
yes
and
the
longer
you
think
the
crazier
you
will
act
cried
nancy
ellen
i
know
you
you
better
promise
me
now
and
stick
to
it
for
answer
kate
turned
off
the
light
but
she
did
not
go
to
bed
she
sat
beside
the
window
and
she
was
still
sitting
there
when
dawn
crept
across
the
lake
and
began
to
lighten
the
room
then
she
stretched
herself
beside
nancy
ellen
who
roused
and
looked
at
her
you
just
coming
to
bed
she
cried
in
wonder
at
least
you
ca
complain
that
i
did
think
said
kate
but
nancy
ellen
found
no
comfort
in
what
she
said
or
the
way
she
said
it
in
fact
she
arose
when
kate
did
feeling
distinctly
sulky
as
they
returned
to
their
room
from
breakfast
kate
laid
out
her
hat
and
gloves
and
began
to
get
ready
to
keep
her
appointment
nancy
ellen
could
endure
the
suspense
no
longer
kate
she
said
in
her
gentlest
tones
if
you
have
no
mercy
on
yourself
have
some
on
your
children
you
no
right
positively
no
right
to
take
such
a
chance
away
from
them
chance
for
what
asked
kate
tersely
education
travel
leisure
every
opportunity
in
the
world
enumerated
nancy
ellen
kate
was
handling
her
gloves
her
forehead
wrinkled
her
eyes
narrowed
in
concentration
that
is
one
side
of
it
she
said
the
other
is
that
neither
my
children
nor
i
have
in
our
blood
breeding
or
mental
cosmos
the
background
that
it
takes
to
make
one
happy
with
money
in
unlimited
quantities
so
far
as
i
concerned
personally
i
happier
this
minute
as
i
am
than
john
jardine
money
ever
could
make
me
i
had
a
fierce
struggle
with
that
question
long
ago
since
i
have
had
nearly
eight
years
of
life
i
love
that
is
good
for
my
soul
the
struggle
to
leave
it
would
be
greater
now
polly
would
be
happier
and
get
more
from
life
as
the
wife
of
big
gangling
henry
peters
than
she
would
as
a
millionaire
daughter
she
be
very
suitable
in
a
farmhouse
parlour
she
be
a
ridiculous
little
figure
at
a
ball
as
for
adam
he
turn
this
down
quick
and
hard
just
you
try
him
cried
nancy
ellen
for
one
thing
he
wo
be
here
at
ten
said
kate
and
for
another
since
it
involves
my
becoming
the
wife
of
john
jardine
it
is
for
adam
to
decide
this
decision
is
strictly
my
own
i
merely
mention
the
children
because
if
i
married
him
it
would
have
an
inevitable
influence
on
their
lives
an
influence
that
i
do
in
the
least
covet
either
for
them
or
for
myself
nancy
ellen
ca
you
remotely
conceive
of
such
a
thing
as
one
human
being
in
the
world
who
is
satisfied
that
he
has
his
share
and
who
believes
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
that
no
man
should
be
allowed
to
amass
and
to
use
for
his
personal
indulgence
the
amount
of
money
that
john
jardine
does
yes
i
can
cried
nancy
ellen
when
i
see
you
and
the
way
you
act
you
have
chance
after
chance
but
you
seem
to
think
that
life
requires
of
you
a
steady
job
of
holding
your
nose
to
the
grindstone
it
was
rather
stubby
to
begin
with
go
on
and
grind
it
clear
off
your
face
if
you
like
all
right
said
kate
then
i
tell
you
definitely
that
i
have
no
particular
desire
to
marry
anybody
i
like
my
life
immensely
as
living
it
i
free
independent
and
my
children
are
in
the
element
to
which
they
were
born
and
where
they
can
live
naturally
and
spend
their
lives
helping
in
the
great
work
of
feeding
clothing
and
housing
their
fellow
men
i
no
desire
to
leave
my
job
or
take
them
from
theirs
to
start
a
lazy
shiftless
life
of
i
meddle
much
with
the
bible
but
i
have
a
profound
belief
in
it
and
a
large
respect
for
it
as
the
greatest
book
in
the
world
and
it
says
the
sweat
of
his
brow
shall
man
earn
his
bread
or
words
to
that
effect
i
was
born
a
sweater
i
shall
just
go
on
sweating
until
i
die
i
refuse
to
begin
perspiring
at
my
time
of
life
you
big
fool
cried
nancy
ellen
look
out
you
danger
of
hell
fire
when
you
call
me
that
warned
kate
fire
away
cried
nancy
ellen
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
voice
when
i
think
what
you
gone
through
kate
stared
at
her
fixedly
what
do
you
know
about
what
i
gone
though
she
demanded
in
a
cold
even
voice
personally
i
think
you
not
qualified
to
mention
that
subject
you
better
let
it
rest
whatever
it
has
been
it
been
of
such
a
nature
that
i
have
come
out
of
it
knowing
when
i
have
my
share
and
when
i
well
off
for
me
if
john
jardine
wants
to
marry
me
and
will
sell
all
he
has
and
come
and
work
on
the
farm
with
me
i
consider
marrying
him
to
leave
my
life
and
what
i
love
to
go
to
chicago
with
him
i
do
not
feel
called
on
or
inclined
to
do
no
i
not
marry
him
and
in
about
fifteen
minutes
i
tell
him
so
and
go
on
making
a
mess
of
your
life
such
as
you
did
for
years
said
nancy
ellen
drying
her
red
eyes
at
least
it
was
my
life
said
kate
i
did
mess
things
for
any
one
else
except
your
children
said
nancy
ellen
as
you
will
said
kate
rising
i
not
marry
john
jardine
and
the
sooner
i
tell
him
so
and
get
it
over
the
better
be
back
in
half
an
hour
kate
walked
slowly
to
the
observation
platform
where
she
had
been
the
previous
evening
with
john
jardine
and
leaning
on
the
railing
she
stood
looking
out
over
the
water
and
down
the
steep
declivity
thinking
how
best
she
could
word
what
she
had
to
say
she
was
so
absorbed
she
did
not
hear
steps
behind
her
or
turn
until
a
sharp
voice
said
you
need
wait
any
longer
he
not
coming
kate
turned
and
glanced
at
the
speaker
and
then
around
to
make
sure
she
was
the
person
being
addressed
she
could
see
no
one
else
the
woman
was
small
light
haired
her
face
enamelled
dressed
beyond
all
reason
and
in
a
manner
wholly
out
of
place
for
morning
at
a
summer
resort
in
michigan
if
you
are
speaking
to
me
will
you
kindly
tell
me
to
whom
you
refer
and
give
me
the
message
you
bring
said
kate
i
refer
to
john
jardine
holt
said
the
little
woman
and
then
kate
saw
that
she
was
shaking
and
gripping
her
hands
for
very
well
said
kate
it
will
save
me
an
unpleasant
task
if
he
does
come
thank
you
and
she
turned
back
to
the
water
you
certainly
did
find
anything
unpleasant
about
being
with
him
half
last
night
said
the
little
woman
kate
turned
again
and
looked
narrowly
at
the
speaker
then
she
laughed
heartily
well
done
jennie
she
cried
why
you
are
such
a
fashionable
lady
such
a
dolly
varden
i
never
saw
who
you
were
how
do
you
do
wo
you
sit
down
and
have
a
chat
it
just
dawning
on
me
that
very
possibly
from
your
dress
and
manner
i
should
have
called
you
mrs
jardine
did
he
tell
you
cried
jennie
he
did
not
said
kate
your
name
was
not
mentioned
he
said
no
word
about
being
married
we
have
been
married
since
a
few
weeks
after
jardine
died
i
taught
him
the
things
you
turned
him
down
for
not
knowing
i
have
studied
him
and
waited
on
him
and
borne
his
children
and
this
is
my
reward
what
are
you
going
to
do
go
back
to
the
hotel
when
i
finish
with
this
view
said
kate
i
find
it
almost
as
attractive
by
day
as
it
was
by
night
brazen
cried
jardine
choose
your
words
carefully
said
kate
i
was
here
first
since
you
have
delivered
your
message
suppose
you
go
and
leave
me
to
my
view
not
till
i
get
ready
said
jardine
perhaps
it
will
help
you
to
know
that
i
was
not
twenty
feet
from
you
at
any
time
last
night
and
that
i
stood
where
i
could
have
touched
you
while
my
husband
made
love
to
you
for
hours
so
said
kate
i
not
at
all
surprised
that
exactly
what
i
should
have
expected
of
you
but
does
it
clarify
the
situation
any
at
least
for
me
when
i
tell
you
that
jardine
gave
me
no
faintest
hint
that
he
was
married
if
you
heard
all
we
said
you
surely
remember
that
you
were
not
mentioned
jardine
sat
down
suddenly
and
gripped
her
little
hands
kate
studied
her
intently
she
wondered
what
she
would
look
like
when
her
hair
was
being
washed
at
this
thought
she
smiled
broadly
that
made
the
other
woman
frantic
you
can
well
laugh
at
me
she
said
i
made
the
banner
fool
of
the
ages
of
myself
when
i
schemed
to
marry
him
i
knew
he
loved
you
he
told
me
so
he
told
me
just
as
he
told
you
last
night
that
he
never
had
loved
any
other
woman
and
he
never
would
i
thought
he
did
know
himself
as
i
knew
him
he
was
so
grand
to
his
mother
i
thought
if
i
taught
him
and
helped
him
back
to
and
gave
him
children
he
must
and
would
love
me
well
i
was
mistaken
he
does
not
and
never
will
every
day
he
thinks
of
you
not
a
night
but
he
speaks
your
name
he
thinks
all
things
can
be
done
with
money
so
do
you
jennie
interrupted
kate
well
i
show
you
that
this
ca
did
you
hear
him
exulting
because
you
are
now
free
cried
jennie
he
thinks
he
will
give
me
a
home
the
children
a
big
income
then
secure
his
freedom
and
marry
you
oh
do
talk
such
rot
cried
kate
john
jardine
thinks
no
such
thing
he
would
insult
me
by
thinking
i
thought
such
a
thing
that
thought
belongs
where
it
sprang
from
right
in
your
little
cramped
blonde
brain
jennie
you
would
are
you
sure
you
would
cried
jennie
leaning
forward
with
hands
clutched
closely
i
should
say
not
said
kate
the
last
thing
on
earth
i
want
is
some
other
woman
husband
now
look
here
jennie
i
tell
you
the
plain
truth
i
thought
last
night
that
john
jardine
was
as
free
as
i
was
or
i
should
have
been
here
with
him
i
thought
he
was
asking
me
again
to
marry
him
and
i
was
not
asleep
last
night
thinking
it
over
i
came
here
to
tell
him
that
i
would
not
does
that
satisfy
you
satisfy
cried
jennie
i
hope
no
other
woman
lives
in
the
kind
of
hell
i
do
it
always
the
way
said
kate
when
people
will
insist
on
getting
out
of
their
class
you
would
have
gotten
ten
times
more
from
life
as
the
wife
of
a
village
merchant
or
a
farmer
than
you
have
as
the
wife
of
a
rich
man
since
you
married
to
him
and
there
are
children
there
nothing
for
you
to
do
but
finish
your
job
as
best
you
can
rest
your
head
easy
about
me
i
would
touch
john
jardine
married
to
you
i
would
touch
him
with
a
pole
divorced
from
you
get
that
clear
in
your
head
and
do
please
go
kate
turned
again
to
the
water
but
when
she
was
sure
jennie
was
far
away
she
sat
down
suddenly
and
asked
of
the
lake
well
would
that
freeze
you
chapter
xxiv
polly
tries
her
wings
finally
kate
wandered
back
to
the
hotel
and
went
to
their
room
to
learn
if
nancy
ellen
was
there
she
was
and
seemed
very
much
perturbed
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
hand
kate
a
big
white
envelope
which
she
opened
and
found
to
be
a
few
lines
from
john
jardine
explaining
that
he
had
been
unexpectedly
called
away
on
some
very
important
business
he
reiterated
his
delight
in
having
seen
her
and
hoped
for
the
same
pleasure
at
no
very
distant
date
kate
read
it
and
tossed
it
on
the
dresser
as
she
did
so
she
saw
a
telegram
lying
opened
among
nancy
ellen
toilet
articles
and
thought
with
pleasure
that
robert
was
coming
she
glanced
at
her
sister
for
confirmation
and
saw
that
she
was
staring
from
the
window
as
if
she
were
in
doubt
about
something
kate
thought
probably
she
was
still
upset
about
john
jardine
and
that
might
as
well
be
gotten
over
so
she
said
that
note
was
not
delivered
promptly
it
is
from
john
jardine
i
should
have
had
it
before
i
left
he
was
called
away
on
important
business
and
wrote
to
let
me
know
he
would
not
be
able
to
keep
his
appointment
but
without
his
knowledge
he
had
a
representative
on
the
spot
nancy
ellen
seemed
interested
so
kate
proceeded
you
could
guess
in
a
thousand
years
i
have
to
tell
you
spang
it
was
his
wife
his
wife
cried
nancy
ellen
but
you
said
so
i
did
said
kate
and
so
he
did
since
the
wife
loomed
on
the
horizon
i
remembered
that
he
said
no
word
to
me
of
marriage
he
merely
said
he
always
had
loved
me
and
always
would
merely
scoffed
nancy
ellen
merely
just
said
kate
he
did
lay
a
finger
on
me
he
ask
me
to
marry
him
he
just
merely
met
me
after
a
long
separation
and
told
me
that
he
still
loved
me
the
brute
said
nancy
ellen
he
should
be
killed
i
ca
see
it
said
kate
he
did
nothing
ungentlemanly
if
we
jumped
to
wrong
conclusions
that
was
not
his
fault
i
doubt
if
he
remembered
or
thought
at
all
of
his
marriage
it
would
be
much
to
forget
i
am
fresh
from
an
interview
with
his
wife
she
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
i
once
secured
her
for
his
mother
maid
you
heard
me
speak
of
her
impossible
john
jardine
would
not
do
that
cried
nancy
ellen
there
a
family
to
prove
it
said
kate
jennie
admits
that
she
studied
him
taught
him
made
herself
indispensable
to
him
and
a
few
weeks
after
his
mother
passing
married
him
after
he
had
told
her
he
did
not
love
her
and
never
could
i
feel
sorry
for
him
sure
poor
defrauded
creature
said
nancy
ellen
what
about
her
nothing
so
far
as
i
can
see
said
kate
by
her
own
account
she
was
responsible
she
should
have
kept
in
her
own
class
all
right
that
settles
jennie
said
nancy
ellen
i
saw
you
notice
the
telegram
from
robert
now
go
on
and
settle
me
is
he
coming
asked
kate
no
he
not
coming
said
nancy
ellen
has
he
eloped
with
the
widder
asked
kate
flippantly
he
merely
telegraphs
that
he
thinks
it
would
be
wise
for
us
to
come
home
on
the
first
train
said
nancy
ellen
for
all
i
can
make
of
that
the
elopement
might
quite
as
well
be
in
your
family
as
mine
kate
held
out
her
hand
nancy
ellen
laid
the
message
in
it
kate
studied
it
carefully
then
she
raised
steady
eyes
to
her
sister
face
do
you
know
what
i
should
do
about
this
she
asked
catch
the
first
train
of
course
she
said
far
be
it
from
me
said
kate
i
should
at
once
telegraph
him
that
his
message
was
not
clear
to
kindly
particularize
we
only
got
settled
we
having
a
fine
time
especially
right
now
why
should
we
pack
up
and
go
home
i
ca
think
of
any
possibility
that
could
arise
that
would
make
it
necessary
for
him
to
send
for
us
can
you
i
can
think
of
two
things
said
nancy
ellen
i
can
think
of
a
very
pretty
confiding
little
cat
of
a
woman
who
is
desperately
infatuated
with
my
husband
and
i
can
think
of
two
children
fathered
by
george
holt
who
might
possibly
just
possibly
have
enough
of
his
blood
in
their
veins
to
be
like
him
given
opportunity
alone
for
a
week
there
is
barely
a
faint
possibility
that
you
might
be
needed
alone
for
the
same
week
there
is
the
faintest
possibility
that
robert
is
in
a
situation
where
i
could
help
him
kate
drew
a
deep
breath
is
life
the
most
amusing
thing
she
asked
i
had
almost
forgotten
my
wings
i
guess
we
better
take
them
and
fly
straight
home
she
arose
and
called
the
office
to
learn
about
trains
and
then
began
packing
her
trunk
as
she
folded
her
dresses
and
stuffed
them
in
rather
carelessly
she
said
i
do
know
why
i
got
it
into
my
head
that
i
could
go
away
and
have
a
few
days
of
a
good
time
without
something
happening
at
home
but
you
are
not
sure
anything
has
happened
at
home
this
call
may
be
for
me
said
nancy
ellen
it
may
but
this
is
july
said
kate
i
been
thinking
hard
and
fast
it
probable
i
can
put
my
finger
on
the
spot
nancy
ellen
paused
and
standing
erect
she
looked
questioningly
at
kate
the
weak
link
in
my
chain
at
the
present
minute
is
polly
said
kate
i
did
pay
much
attention
at
the
time
because
there
was
enough
of
it
really
to
attract
attention
but
since
i
think
i
can
recall
signs
of
growing
discontent
in
polly
lately
she
fussed
about
the
work
and
resented
being
left
in
the
house
while
i
went
to
the
fields
and
she
had
begun
looking
up
the
road
to
peters
so
much
that
her
head
was
slightly
turned
toward
the
north
most
of
the
time
with
me
away
what
do
you
think
demanded
nancy
ellen
think
very
likely
she
has
decided
that
she
sacrifice
her
chance
for
more
schooling
and
to
teach
for
the
sake
of
marrying
a
big
green
country
boy
named
hank
peters
said
kate
thereby
keeping
in
her
own
class
suggested
nancy
ellen
kate
laughed
shortly
exactly
she
said
i
did
aspire
to
anything
different
for
her
from
what
she
has
had
but
i
wanted
her
to
have
more
education
and
wait
until
she
was
older
marriage
is
too
hard
work
for
a
girl
to
begin
at
less
than
eighteen
if
it
is
polly
and
she
has
gone
away
with
hank
peters
they
no
place
to
go
but
his
home
and
if
ever
she
thought
i
worked
her
too
hard
she
find
out
she
has
played
most
of
her
life
when
she
begins
taking
orders
from
amanda
peters
you
know
her
she
never
can
keep
a
girl
more
than
a
week
and
she
always
wanting
one
if
polly
has
tackled
that
job
god
help
her
cheer
up
we
in
that
delightful
state
of
uncertainty
where
polly
may
be
blacking
the
cook
stove
like
a
dutiful
daughter
while
robert
has
decided
that
he
like
a
divorce
said
nancy
ellen
nancy
ellen
there
nothing
in
that
so
far
as
robert
is
concerned
he
told
me
so
the
evening
we
came
away
said
kate
nancy
ellen
banged
down
a
trunk
lid
and
said
well
i
am
getting
to
the
place
where
i
do
much
care
whether
there
is
or
there
is
not
what
a
whopper
laughed
kate
but
cheer
up
this
is
my
trouble
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
wish
i
knew
for
sure
if
she
eloped
and
all
over
with
we
might
as
well
stay
and
finish
our
visit
if
married
i
ca
unmarry
her
and
i
would
if
i
could
how
are
you
going
to
apply
your
philosophy
to
yourself
asked
nancy
ellen
by
letting
time
and
polly
take
their
course
said
kate
this
is
a
place
where
parents
are
of
no
account
whatever
they
stand
back
until
it
time
to
clean
up
the
wreck
and
then
they
get
theirs
usually
theirs
and
several
of
someone
else
in
the
bargain
as
the
train
stopped
at
hartley
kate
sat
where
she
could
see
robert
on
the
platform
it
was
only
a
fleeting
glance
but
she
thought
she
had
never
seen
him
look
so
wholesome
so
vital
so
much
a
man
to
be
desired
no
wonder
a
woman
lacking
in
fine
scruples
would
covet
him
thought
kate
to
nancy
ellen
she
said
hastily
the
trouble
mine
on
the
platform
where
demanded
nancy
ellen
peering
from
the
window
kate
smiled
as
she
walked
from
the
car
and
confronted
robert
get
it
over
quickly
she
said
it
polly
he
nodded
did
she
remember
to
call
on
the
squire
she
asked
oh
yes
said
robert
it
was
at
peters
and
they
had
the
whole
neighbourhood
in
kate
swayed
slightly
then
lifted
her
head
her
eyes
blazing
she
had
come
feeling
not
altogether
guiltless
and
quite
prepared
to
overlook
a
youthful
elopement
the
insult
of
having
her
only
daughter
given
a
wedding
at
the
home
of
the
groom
about
which
the
whole
neighbourhood
would
be
laughing
at
her
was
a
different
matter
slowly
the
high
colour
faded
from
kate
face
as
she
stepped
back
excuse
me
nancy
ellen
she
said
i
did
mean
to
deprive
you
of
the
chance
of
even
speaking
to
robert
i
knew
this
was
for
me
i
was
to
learn
what
choice
morsel
life
had
in
store
for
me
now
it
one
that
will
be
bitter
on
my
tongue
to
the
day
of
my
death
oh
kate
i
as
so
sorry
that
if
this
had
to
happen
it
happened
in
just
that
way
said
nancy
ellen
but
do
mind
they
only
foolish
kids
who
and
peters
and
the
neighbours
who
attended
the
wedding
foolish
kids
oh
no
said
kate
where
adam
i
told
him
i
bring
you
out
said
robert
why
did
he
send
for
you
or
do
something
demanded
kate
i
afraid
the
facts
are
that
polly
lied
to
him
said
robert
she
told
him
that
peters
were
having
a
party
and
peters
wanted
her
to
come
early
and
help
her
with
the
supper
they
had
the
magistrate
out
from
town
and
had
the
ceremony
an
hour
before
adam
got
there
when
he
arrived
and
found
out
what
had
happened
he
told
polly
and
the
peters
family
exactly
his
opinion
of
them
and
then
he
went
home
and
turned
on
all
the
lights
and
sat
where
he
could
be
seen
on
the
porch
all
evening
as
a
protest
in
evidence
of
his
disapproval
i
take
it
slowly
the
colour
began
to
creep
back
into
kate
face
the
good
boy
she
said
in
commendation
he
called
me
at
once
and
we
talked
it
over
and
i
sent
you
the
telegram
but
as
he
said
it
was
done
there
was
no
use
trying
to
undo
it
one
thing
will
be
a
comfort
to
you
all
of
your
family
and
almost
all
of
your
friends
left
as
soon
as
adam
spoke
his
piece
and
they
found
it
was
a
wedding
and
not
a
party
to
which
they
been
invited
it
was
a
shabby
trick
of
peters
kate
assented
it
was
because
i
felt
instinctively
that
peters
had
it
in
her
to
do
tricks
like
that
that
i
never
would
have
anything
to
do
with
her
said
kate
more
than
to
be
passing
civil
this
is
how
she
gets
her
revenge
and
her
hired
girl
for
no
wages
i
be
bound
it
a
shabby
trick
i
glad
adam
saved
me
the
trouble
of
telling
her
so
robert
took
nancy
ellen
home
and
then
drove
to
bates
corners
with
kate
in
a
few
days
now
i
hope
we
can
see
each
other
oftener
he
said
on
the
way
i
got
a
car
yesterday
and
it
does
seem
so
complicated
any
intelligent
person
can
learn
to
drive
in
a
short
time
i
like
it
so
much
and
i
knew
i
have
such
constant
use
for
it
that
now
this
is
a
secret
i
ordered
another
for
nancy
ellen
so
she
can
drive
about
town
and
run
out
here
as
she
chooses
will
she
be
pleased
she
be
overjoyed
that
was
dear
of
you
robert
only
one
thing
in
world
would
please
her
more
said
kate
what
that
asked
robert
kate
looked
him
in
the
eye
and
smiled
oh
he
said
but
there
is
nothing
in
it
except
talk
that
worries
and
humiliates
nancy
ellen
said
kate
kate
he
said
suddenly
if
you
were
in
my
shoes
what
would
you
do
the
next
time
i
got
a
phone
call
or
a
note
from
southey
and
she
was
having
one
of
those
terrible
headaches
i
should
say
dreadfully
sorry
southey
but
a
breath
of
talk
that
might
be
unpleasant
for
you
and
for
my
wife
has
come
to
my
ear
so
i
know
you
think
it
wiser
to
call
mills
who
can
serve
you
better
than
i
in
a
great
rush
this
afternoon
that
is
what
i
should
do
robert
and
i
should
do
it
quickly
and
emphatically
then
i
should
interest
nancy
ellen
in
her
car
for
a
time
and
then
i
should
keep
my
eyes
open
and
the
first
time
i
found
in
my
practice
a
sound
baby
with
a
clean
bill
of
health
and
no
encumbrances
i
should
have
it
dressed
attractively
and
bestow
it
on
nancy
ellen
as
casually
as
i
did
the
car
and
in
the
meantime
love
her
plenty
robert
you
can
never
know
how
she
feels
about
this
and
it
in
no
way
her
fault
she
could
possibly
have
known
while
you
would
have
married
her
just
the
same
if
you
had
known
is
that
so
it
quite
so
kate
i
think
your
head
is
level
and
i
follow
your
advice
to
the
letter
now
you
have
my
lame
leg
as
the
dog
said
in
mcguffey
third
what
can
i
do
for
this
poor
dog
nothing
said
kate
i
got
to
hold
still
and
take
it
life
will
do
the
doing
i
do
want
to
croak
but
remember
my
word
it
will
do
plenty
we
come
often
he
said
as
he
turned
to
go
back
kate
slowly
walked
up
the
path
dreading
to
meet
adam
he
evidently
had
been
watching
for
her
for
he
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
took
her
arm
and
they
walked
up
the
steps
and
into
the
living
room
together
she
looked
at
him
he
looked
at
her
at
last
he
said
afraid
that
a
good
deal
of
this
is
my
fault
mother
how
so
asked
kate
tersely
i
guess
i
betrayed
your
trust
in
me
said
adam
heavily
of
course
i
did
all
my
work
and
attended
to
things
but
in
the
evening
after
work
was
over
the
very
first
evening
on
the
way
home
we
stopped
to
talk
to
henry
at
the
gate
and
he
got
in
and
came
on
down
we
could
see
milly
at
their
gate
and
i
wanted
her
i
wanted
her
so
much
mother
and
it
was
going
to
be
lonesome
so
all
of
us
went
on
there
and
she
came
up
here
and
we
sat
on
the
porch
and
then
i
took
her
home
and
that
left
henry
and
polly
together
the
next
night
henry
took
us
to
town
for
a
treat
and
we
were
all
together
and
the
next
night
milly
asked
us
all
there
and
so
it
went
it
was
all
as
open
and
innocent
as
it
could
be
only
henry
and
polly
were
in
awful
earnest
and
she
was
bound
she
would
be
sent
to
town
to
school
why
did
she
tell
me
so
she
never
objected
a
word
to
me
said
kate
well
mother
you
are
so
big
and
polly
was
so
little
and
she
was
used
to
minding
yes
this
looks
like
it
said
kate
well
go
on
that
all
said
adam
it
was
only
that
instead
of
staying
at
home
and
attending
to
our
own
affairs
we
were
somewhere
every
night
or
milly
and
henry
were
here
that
is
where
i
was
to
blame
i
afraid
you
never
forgive
me
mother
but
i
did
take
good
care
of
sister
i
left
her
to
henry
peters
while
i
tried
to
see
how
nice
i
could
be
to
milly
i
did
know
what
polly
and
henry
were
planning
honest
i
did
mother
i
would
have
told
uncle
robert
and
sent
for
you
if
i
had
i
thought
when
i
went
there
it
was
to
be
our
little
crowd
like
it
was
at
york
i
was
furious
when
i
found
they
were
married
i
told
and
peters
what
they
were
right
before
the
company
and
then
i
came
straight
home
and
all
the
family
and
york
and
most
of
the
others
came
straight
away
only
a
few
stayed
to
the
supper
i
was
so
angry
with
polly
i
just
pushed
her
away
and
did
even
say
to
her
the
little
silly
fool
mother
if
she
had
told
you
you
would
have
let
her
stay
at
home
this
winter
and
got
her
clothing
and
let
her
be
married
here
when
she
was
old
enough
would
you
certainly
said
kate
all
the
world
knows
that
bates
all
marry
and
they
all
marry
young
do
blame
yourself
adam
if
polly
had
it
in
her
system
to
do
this
and
she
did
or
she
would
have
done
it
the
thing
would
have
happened
when
i
was
here
and
right
under
my
nose
it
was
a
scheme
all
planned
and
ready
before
i
left
i
know
that
now
let
it
go
there
nothing
we
can
do
until
things
begin
to
go
wrong
as
they
always
do
in
this
kind
of
wedding
then
we
shall
get
our
call
in
the
meantime
you
must
push
your
sister
away
she
may
need
you
sooner
than
you
think
and
will
you
just
please
have
enough
confidence
in
my
common
sense
and
love
for
you
to
come
to
me
first
when
you
feel
that
there
a
girl
who
is
indispensable
to
your
future
adam
yes
i
will
said
adam
and
it
wo
be
long
and
the
girl
will
be
milly
york
all
right
said
kate
gravely
whenever
the
time
comes
let
me
know
about
it
now
see
if
you
can
find
me
something
to
eat
till
i
lay
off
my
hat
and
wash
it
was
a
long
hot
ride
and
i
tired
since
nothing
i
can
do
i
wish
i
had
stayed
where
i
was
no
i
do
either
i
see
joy
coming
over
the
hill
for
nancy
ellen
why
is
joy
coming
to
nancy
ellen
asked
the
boy
pausing
an
instant
before
he
started
to
the
kitchen
oh
because
she
had
such
a
very
tough
uncomfortable
time
with
life
said
kate
that
in
the
very
nature
of
things
joy
should
come
her
way
the
boy
stood
mystified
until
the
expression
on
his
face
so
amused
kate
that
she
began
laughing
then
he
understood
that
why
it
coming
said
kate
and
here
how
it
coming
she
is
going
to
get
rid
of
a
bothersome
worry
that
troubling
her
head
and
she
going
to
have
a
very
splendid
gift
but
it
a
deep
secret
then
you
have
to
whisper
it
said
adam
going
to
her
and
holding
a
convenient
ear
kate
rested
her
hands
on
his
shoulder
a
minute
as
she
leaned
on
him
her
face
buried
in
his
crisp
black
hair
then
she
whispered
the
secret
crickey
is
that
grand
cried
the
boy
backing
away
to
stare
at
her
yes
it
is
so
grand
i
going
to
try
it
ourselves
said
kate
a
pretty
snug
balance
in
the
bank
and
i
think
it
would
be
great
fun
evenings
or
when
we
want
to
go
to
town
in
a
hurry
and
the
horses
are
tired
adam
was
slowly
moving
toward
the
kitchen
his
face
more
of
a
study
than
before
mother
he
said
as
he
reached
the
door
i
be
hanged
if
i
know
how
to
take
you
i
thought
you
just
raise
cain
over
what
polly
has
done
but
you
act
so
sane
and
sensible
someway
it
does
seem
so
bad
as
it
did
and
i
feel
more
sorry
for
polly
than
like
going
back
on
her
and
are
you
truly
in
earnest
about
a
car
i
going
to
think
very
seriously
about
it
this
winter
and
i
feel
almost
sure
it
will
come
true
by
early
spring
said
kate
but
who
said
anything
about
back
on
polly
oh
york
and
all
the
neighbours
said
that
you
never
forgive
her
and
that
she
never
darken
your
door
again
and
things
like
that
until
i
was
almost
crazy
answered
adam
kate
smiled
grimly
adam
she
said
i
had
seven
years
of
that
you
door
business
myself
it
a
mighty
cold
hard
proposition
it
a
wonder
the
neighbours
did
remember
that
maybe
they
did
and
thought
i
was
so
much
of
a
bates
leopard
that
i
change
my
spots
if
they
are
watching
me
they
will
find
that
i
am
not
spotted
i
sorry
and
humiliated
over
what
polly
has
done
but
i
not
going
to
gnash
my
teeth
and
tear
my
hair
and
wail
in
public
or
in
private
i
trying
to
keep
my
real
mean
spot
so
deep
it
ca
be
seen
if
ever
i
get
my
chance
adam
you
watch
me
pay
back
peters
that
is
the
size
and
location
of
my
spot
but
it
far
deeper
than
my
skin
now
go
on
and
find
me
food
man
food
adam
sat
close
while
kate
ate
her
supper
then
he
helped
her
unpack
her
trunk
and
hang
away
her
dresses
and
then
they
sat
on
the
porch
talking
for
a
long
time
when
at
last
they
arose
to
go
to
bed
kate
said
adam
about
polly
first
time
you
see
her
if
she
asks
tell
her
she
left
home
of
her
own
free
will
and
accord
and
in
her
own
way
which
by
the
way
happens
to
be
a
holt
way
but
you
need
mention
that
i
think
by
this
time
she
has
learned
or
soon
she
will
learn
that
and
whenever
she
wants
to
come
back
and
face
me
to
come
right
ahead
i
can
stand
it
if
she
can
can
you
get
that
straight
adam
said
he
could
he
got
that
straight
and
so
much
else
that
by
the
time
he
finished
polly
realized
that
both
he
and
her
mother
had
left
her
in
the
house
to
try
to
shield
her
that
if
she
had
told
what
she
wanted
in
a
straightforward
manner
she
might
have
had
a
wedding
outfit
prepared
and
been
married
from
her
home
at
a
proper
time
and
in
a
proper
way
and
without
putting
her
mother
to
shame
before
the
community
polly
was
very
much
ashamed
of
herself
by
the
time
adam
finished
she
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
blame
henry
she
knew
he
was
no
more
to
blame
than
she
was
but
she
did
store
up
a
grievance
against
and
peters
they
were
older
and
had
had
experience
with
the
world
they
might
have
told
polly
what
she
should
do
instead
of
having
done
everything
in
their
power
to
make
her
do
what
she
had
done
bribing
coaxing
urging
all
in
the
direction
of
her
inclinations
at
heart
polly
was
big
enough
to
admit
that
she
had
followed
her
inclinations
without
thinking
at
all
what
the
result
would
be
adam
never
would
have
done
what
she
had
adam
would
have
thought
of
his
mother
and
his
name
and
his
honour
poor
little
polly
had
to
admit
that
honour
with
her
had
always
been
a
matter
of
now
remember
be
careful
and
like
caution
on
the
lips
of
her
mother
the
more
polly
thought
the
worse
she
felt
the
worse
she
felt
the
more
the
whole
peters
family
tried
to
comfort
her
she
was
violently
homesick
in
a
few
days
but
adam
had
said
she
was
to
come
when
she
could
face
her
mother
and
polly
suddenly
found
that
she
would
rather
undertake
to
run
ten
miles
than
to
face
her
mother
so
she
began
a
process
of
hiding
from
her
if
she
sat
on
the
porch
and
saw
her
mother
coming
she
ran
in
the
house
she
would
go
to
no
public
place
where
she
might
meet
her
for
a
few
weeks
she
lived
a
life
of
working
for
peters
from
dawn
to
dark
under
the
stimulus
of
what
a
sweet
girl
she
was
how
splendidly
she
did
things
how
fortunate
henry
was
interspersed
with
continual
kissing
patting
and
petting
all
very
new
and
unusual
to
polly
by
that
time
she
was
so
very
ill
she
could
not
lift
her
head
from
the
pillow
half
the
day
but
it
was
to
the
credit
of
the
badly
disappointed
peters
family
that
they
kept
up
the
petting
when
polly
grew
better
she
had
no
desire
to
go
anywhere
she
worked
to
make
up
for
the
trouble
she
had
been
during
her
illness
to
sew
every
spare
moment
and
to
do
her
full
share
of
the
day
work
in
the
house
of
an
excessively
nice
woman
whose
work
never
was
done
and
most
hopeless
thing
of
all
never
would
be
peters
head
was
full
of
things
that
she
meant
to
do
three
years
in
the
future
every
night
found
polly
so
tired
she
staggered
to
bed
early
as
possible
every
morning
found
her
confronting
the
same
round
which
from
the
nature
of
her
condition
every
morning
was
more
difficult
for
her
kate
and
adam
followed
their
usual
routine
with
only
the
alterations
required
by
the
absence
of
polly
kate
now
prepared
breakfast
while
adam
did
the
feeding
and
milking
washed
the
dishes
and
made
the
beds
while
he
hitched
up
then
went
to
the
field
with
him
on
rainy
days
he
swept
and
she
dusted
always
they
talked
over
and
planned
everything
they
did
in
the
house
or
afield
always
they
schemed
contrived
economized
and
worked
to
attain
the
shortest
easiest
end
to
any
result
they
strove
for
they
were
growing
in
physical
force
they
were
efficient
they
attended
their
own
affairs
strictly
their
work
was
always
done
on
time
their
place
in
order
their
deposits
at
the
bank
frequent
as
the
cold
days
came
they
missed
polly
but
scarcely
ever
mentioned
her
they
had
more
books
and
read
and
studied
together
while
every
few
evenings
adam
picked
up
his
hat
and
disappeared
but
soon
he
and
milly
came
in
together
then
they
all
read
popped
corn
made
taffy
knitted
often
kate
was
called
away
by
some
sewing
or
upstairs
work
she
wanted
to
do
so
that
the
youngsters
had
plenty
of
time
alone
to
revel
in
the
wonder
of
life
greatest
secret
to
kate
ears
came
the
word
that
polly
would
be
a
mother
in
the
spring
that
the
peters
family
were
delighted
and
anxious
for
the
child
to
be
a
girl
as
they
found
six
males
sufficient
for
one
family
polly
was
looking
well
feeling
fine
was
a
famous
little
worker
and
seldom
sat
on
a
chair
because
some
member
of
the
peters
family
usually
held
her
i
should
think
she
would
get
sick
of
all
that
mushing
said
adam
when
he
repeated
these
things
she
not
like
us
said
kate
she
take
all
she
can
get
and
call
for
more
she
a
long
time
coming
but
i
glad
she
well
and
happy
buncombe
said
adam
she
is
so
very
well
she
white
as
putty
and
there
are
great
big
dark
hollows
under
her
eyes
and
she
always
panting
for
breath
like
she
had
been
running
nearly
every
time
i
pass
there
i
see
her
out
scrubbing
the
porches
or
feeding
the
chickens
or
washing
windows
or
something
you
bet
peters
has
got
a
fine
hired
girl
now
and
she
smiling
all
over
about
it
she
really
has
something
to
smile
about
said
kate
to
polly
ears
went
the
word
that
adam
and
her
mother
were
having
a
fine
time
together
always
together
and
that
they
had
milly
york
up
three
times
a
week
to
spend
the
evening
and
that
milly
said
that
it
passed
her
to
see
why
polly
ran
away
from
holt
she
was
the
grandest
woman
alive
and
if
she
had
any
running
to
do
in
her
neighbourhood
she
would
run
to
her
and
not
from
her
whereupon
polly
closed
her
lips
firmly
and
looked
black
but
not
before
she
had
said
well
if
mother
had
done
just
one
night
a
week
of
that
entertaining
for
henry
and
me
we
would
have
run
from
her
either
polly
said
nothing
until
april
then
kate
answered
the
telephone
one
day
and
a
few
seconds
later
was
ringing
for
adam
as
if
she
would
pull
down
the
bell
he
came
running
and
soon
was
on
his
way
to
peters
with
the
single
buggy
with
instructions
to
drive
slowly
and
carefully
and
on
no
account
to
let
polly
slip
getting
out
the
peters
family
had
all
gone
to
bury
an
aunt
in
the
neighbourhood
leaving
polly
alone
for
the
day
and
polly
at
once
called
up
her
mother
and
said
she
was
dying
to
see
her
and
if
she
could
come
home
for
the
day
she
would
die
soon
and
be
glad
of
it
kate
knew
the
visit
should
not
have
been
made
at
that
time
and
in
that
way
but
she
knew
that
polly
was
under
a
dangerous
nervous
strain
she
herself
would
not
go
to
peters
in
peters
absence
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
as
she
waited
for
polly
she
thought
of
many
things
she
would
say
when
she
saw
her
she
took
her
in
her
arms
and
almost
carried
her
into
the
house
and
she
said
nothing
at
all
save
how
glad
she
was
to
see
her
and
she
did
nothing
at
all
except
to
try
with
all
her
might
to
comfort
and
please
her
for
to
kate
polly
did
not
seem
like
a
strong
healthy
girl
approaching
maternity
she
appeared
like
a
very
sick
woman
who
sorely
needed
attention
while
a
few
questions
made
her
so
sure
of
it
that
she
at
once
called
robert
he
gave
both
of
them
all
the
comfort
he
could
but
what
he
told
nancy
ellen
was
polly
has
had
no
attention
whatever
she
wants
me
and
i
have
to
go
but
it
a
case
i
like
to
i
do
all
i
can
but
the
time
is
short
oh
lord
said
nancy
ellen
is
it
one
more
for
kate
yes
said
robert
i
am
very
much
afraid
it
more
for
kate
chapter
xxv
one
more
for
kate
polly
and
kate
had
a
long
day
together
while
adam
was
about
the
house
much
of
the
time
both
of
them
said
and
did
everything
they
could
think
of
to
cheer
and
comfort
polly
whose
spirits
seemed
most
variable
one
minute
she
would
be
laughing
and
planning
for
the
summer
gaily
the
next
she
would
be
gloomy
and
depressed
and
declaring
she
never
would
live
through
the
birth
of
her
baby
if
she
had
appeared
well
this
would
not
have
worried
kate
but
she
looked
even
sicker
than
she
seemed
to
feel
she
was
thin
while
her
hands
were
hot
and
tremulous
as
the
afternoon
went
on
and
time
to
go
came
nearer
she
grew
more
and
more
despondent
until
kate
proposed
watching
when
the
peters
family
came
home
calling
them
up
and
telling
them
that
polly
was
there
would
remain
all
night
and
that
henry
should
come
down
polly
flatly
vetoed
the
proposition
but
she
seemed
to
feel
much
better
after
it
had
been
made
she
was
like
herself
again
for
a
short
time
and
then
she
turned
to
kate
and
said
suddenly
mother
if
i
do
get
over
this
will
you
take
my
baby
kate
looked
at
polly
intently
what
she
saw
stopped
the
ready
answer
that
was
on
her
lips
she
stood
thinking
deeply
at
last
she
said
gently
why
polly
would
you
want
to
trust
a
tiny
baby
with
a
woman
you
ran
away
from
yourself
mother
i
have
asked
you
to
forgive
me
for
the
light
i
put
you
in
before
the
neighbours
said
polly
because
i
knew
you
honestly
do
it
and
would
lie
to
say
you
did
i
do
know
what
made
me
do
that
i
was
tired
staying
alone
at
the
house
so
much
i
was
wild
about
henry
i
was
bound
i
would
leave
him
and
go
away
to
school
i
just
thought
it
would
settle
everything
easily
and
quickly
i
never
once
thought
of
how
it
would
make
you
look
and
feel
honestly
i
did
mother
you
believe
me
do
you
yes
i
believe
you
said
kate
it
was
an
awful
thing
for
me
to
do
said
polly
i
was
foolish
and
crazy
and
i
suppose
i
should
say
it
but
i
certainly
did
have
a
lot
of
encouragement
from
the
peters
family
they
all
seemed
to
think
it
would
be
a
great
joke
that
it
would
make
any
difference
and
all
that
so
i
just
did
it
i
knew
i
should
have
done
it
but
mother
you
never
know
the
fight
i
had
all
my
life
to
keep
from
telling
stories
and
sneaking
i
hated
your
everlasting
be
careful
but
when
i
hated
it
most
i
needed
it
worst
and
i
knew
it
when
i
grew
older
if
only
you
had
been
here
to
say
be
careful
just
once
i
never
would
have
done
it
but
of
course
i
could
have
you
to
keep
me
straight
all
my
life
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
give
my
life
and
never
whimper
if
i
could
be
back
home
as
i
was
this
time
last
year
and
have
a
chance
to
do
things
your
way
but
that
is
past
and
i
change
it
what
i
came
for
and
what
i
want
to
know
now
is
if
i
go
will
you
take
my
baby
polly
you
know
the
peters
family
would
let
me
have
it
said
kate
if
it
a
boy
they
would
want
it
said
polly
neither
would
you
for
that
matter
if
it
a
girl
they
fight
for
it
but
it
wo
do
them
any
good
all
i
want
to
know
is
will
you
take
it
of
course
i
would
polly
said
kate
since
i
have
your
word
i
feel
better
said
polly
and
mother
you
need
be
afraid
of
it
it
will
be
all
right
i
have
thought
about
it
so
much
i
have
it
all
figured
out
it
going
to
be
a
girl
and
it
going
to
be
exactly
like
you
and
its
name
is
going
to
be
katherine
eleanor
i
have
thought
about
you
every
hour
i
was
awake
since
i
have
been
gone
so
the
baby
will
have
to
be
exactly
like
you
there
wo
be
the
taint
of
grandmother
in
it
that
there
is
in
me
you
need
be
afraid
i
quit
sneaking
forever
when
adam
told
me
what
i
had
done
to
you
i
have
gone
straight
as
a
dart
mother
every
single
minute
since
mother
truly
i
have
kate
sat
down
suddenly
an
awful
sickness
in
her
heart
why
you
poor
child
you
she
said
oh
i
been
all
right
said
polly
i
been
almost
petted
and
loved
to
death
but
mother
there
never
should
be
the
amount
of
work
attached
to
living
that
there
is
in
that
house
it
never
ending
it
intolerable
peters
just
goes
until
she
drops
and
then
instead
of
sleeping
she
lies
awake
planning
some
hard
foolish
unnecessary
thing
to
do
next
maybe
she
can
stand
it
herself
but
tired
out
i
going
to
sit
down
and
not
budge
to
do
another
stroke
until
after
the
baby
comes
and
then
i
am
going
to
coax
henry
to
rent
a
piece
of
land
and
move
to
ourselves
kate
took
heart
that
will
be
fine
she
cried
that
will
be
the
very
thing
i
ask
the
boys
to
keep
their
eyes
open
for
any
chance
for
you
you
need
take
any
bother
about
it
said
polly
because
that
what
is
going
to
happen
all
i
want
to
be
sure
of
now
is
that
you
and
adam
will
take
my
baby
i
see
to
the
rest
how
will
you
see
to
it
polly
asked
kate
gently
well
it
already
seen
to
for
matter
of
that
said
polly
conclusively
i
known
for
quite
a
while
that
i
was
sick
but
i
could
make
them
do
anything
but
kiss
me
and
laugh
at
me
until
i
am
so
ill
that
i
know
better
how
i
feel
than
anybody
else
i
got
tired
being
laughed
at
and
put
off
about
everything
so
one
day
in
hartley
while
mother
peters
was
shopping
i
just
went
in
to
the
lawyer
grandmother
always
went
to
and
told
him
all
about
what
i
wanted
he
has
the
papers
made
out
all
right
and
proper
so
when
i
send
for
uncle
robert
i
am
going
to
send
for
him
too
and
soon
as
the
baby
comes
i
put
in
its
name
and
sign
it
and
make
henry
and
then
if
i
have
to
go
you
wo
have
a
bit
of
trouble
kate
gazed
at
polly
in
dumb
amazement
she
was
speechless
for
a
time
then
to
break
the
strain
she
said
my
soul
did
you
really
polly
i
guess
there
is
more
bates
in
you
than
i
had
thought
oh
there
some
bates
in
me
said
polly
there
enough
to
make
me
live
until
i
sign
that
paper
and
make
henry
peters
sign
it
and
send
thomlins
to
you
with
it
and
the
baby
i
can
do
that
because
going
to
ten
days
later
she
did
exactly
what
she
had
said
she
would
then
she
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
went
into
a
convulsion
out
of
which
she
never
came
while
the
peters
family
refused
kate
plea
to
lay
polly
beside
her
grandmother
and
laid
her
in
their
family
lot
kate
moaning
dumbly
sat
clasping
a
tiny
red
girl
in
her
arms
adam
drove
to
hartley
to
deposit
one
more
paper
the
most
precious
of
all
in
the
safety
deposit
box
kate
and
adam
mourned
too
deeply
to
talk
about
it
they
went
about
their
daily
rounds
silently
each
busy
with
regrets
and
self
investigations
they
watched
each
other
carefully
were
kinder
than
they
ever
had
been
to
everyone
they
came
in
contact
with
the
baby
they
frankly
adored
kate
had
reared
her
own
children
with
small
misgivings
quite
casually
in
fact
but
her
heart
was
torn
to
the
depths
about
this
baby
life
never
would
be
even
what
it
had
been
before
polly
left
them
for
into
her
going
there
entered
an
element
of
and
continual
adam
felt
that
if
he
had
been
less
occupied
with
milly
york
and
had
taken
proper
care
of
his
sister
he
would
not
have
lost
her
kate
had
less
time
for
recrimination
because
she
had
the
baby
look
for
a
good
man
to
help
you
this
summer
adam
she
said
the
baby
is
full
of
poison
which
can
be
eliminated
only
slowly
if
i
get
it
out
before
teething
i
lose
her
and
then
we
never
shall
hear
the
last
from
the
peters
family
adam
consigned
the
peters
family
to
a
location
he
thought
suitable
for
them
on
the
instant
he
spoke
with
unusual
bitterness
because
he
had
heard
that
the
peters
family
were
telling
that
polly
had
grieved
herself
to
death
while
his
mother
had
engineered
a
scheme
whereby
she
had
stolen
the
baby
occasionally
a
word
drifted
to
kate
here
and
there
until
she
realized
much
of
what
they
were
saying
at
first
she
grieved
too
deeply
to
pay
any
attention
but
as
the
summer
went
on
and
the
baby
flourished
and
grew
fine
and
strong
and
she
had
time
in
the
garden
she
began
to
feel
better
grief
began
to
wear
away
as
it
always
does
by
midsummer
the
baby
was
in
short
clothes
sitting
in
a
high
chair
which
if
miss
baby
only
had
known
it
was
a
throne
before
which
knelt
her
two
adoring
subjects
polly
had
said
the
baby
would
be
like
kate
its
hair
and
colouring
were
like
hers
but
it
had
the
brown
eyes
of
its
father
and
enough
of
his
facial
lines
to
tone
down
the
too
generous
bates
features
when
the
baby
was
five
months
old
it
was
too
pretty
for
adequate
description
one
baby
has
no
business
with
perfect
features
a
mop
of
curly
yellow
silk
hair
and
big
brown
eyes
one
of
the
questions
kate
and
adam
discussed
most
frequently
was
where
they
would
send
her
to
college
while
one
they
did
not
discuss
was
how
sick
her
stomach
teeth
would
make
her
they
merely
lived
in
mortal
dread
of
that
convulsion
was
a
word
that
held
a
terror
for
kate
above
any
other
in
the
medical
books
the
baby
had
a
good
formal
name
but
no
one
ever
used
it
adam
on
first
lifting
the
blanket
had
fancied
the
child
resembled
its
mother
and
had
called
her
little
poll
the
name
clung
to
her
kate
could
not
call
such
a
tiny
morsel
either
kate
or
katherine
she
liked
little
poll
better
the
baby
had
three
regular
visitors
one
was
her
father
he
was
not
fond
of
kate
little
poll
suited
him
he
expressed
his
feeling
by
bringing
gifts
of
toys
candy
and
unsuitable
clothes
kate
kept
these
things
in
evidence
when
she
saw
him
coming
and
swept
them
from
sight
when
he
went
for
she
had
the
good
sense
not
to
antagonize
him
nancy
ellen
came
almost
every
day
proudly
driving
her
new
car
and
with
the
light
of
a
new
joy
on
her
face
she
never
said
anything
to
kate
but
kate
knew
what
had
happened
nancy
ellen
came
to
see
the
baby
she
brought
it
lovely
and
delicate
little
shoes
embroidered
dresses
and
hoods
cloaks
and
blankets
one
day
as
she
sat
holding
it
she
said
to
kate
is
the
baby
a
dreadful
bother
to
you
you
not
getting
half
your
usual
work
done
no
i
doing
unusual
work
said
kate
lightly
adam
is
hiring
a
man
who
does
my
work
very
well
in
the
fields
there
is
money
that
would
hire
me
to
let
any
one
else
take
my
job
indoors
right
now
a
slow
red
crept
into
nancy
ellen
cheeks
she
had
meant
to
be
diplomatic
but
diplomacy
never
worked
well
with
kate
as
nancy
ellen
often
said
kate
understood
a
better
nancy
ellen
used
the
hammer
her
face
flushed
her
arms
closed
tightly
give
me
this
baby
she
demanded
kate
looked
at
her
in
helpless
amazement
give
it
to
me
repeated
nancy
ellen
she
a
gift
to
me
said
kate
slowly
one
the
peters
family
are
searching
heaven
and
earth
to
find
an
excuse
to
take
from
me
i
hear
they
been
to
a
lawyer
twice
already
i
would
give
her
up
to
save
my
soul
alive
for
myself
for
you
if
i
would
let
you
have
her
they
would
not
leave
you
in
possession
a
day
are
they
really
trying
to
get
her
asked
nancy
ellen
slowly
loosening
her
grip
they
are
said
kate
they
sent
a
lawyer
to
get
a
copy
of
the
papers
to
see
if
they
could
pick
a
flaw
in
them
can
they
cried
nancy
ellen
god
knows
said
kate
slowly
i
hope
not
thomlins
is
the
best
lawyer
in
hartley
he
says
not
he
says
henry
put
his
neck
in
the
noose
when
he
signed
the
papers
the
only
chance
i
can
see
for
him
would
be
to
plead
undue
influence
when
you
look
at
her
you
blame
him
for
wanting
her
i
two
hopes
one
that
his
mother
will
not
want
the
extra
work
the
other
that
the
next
girl
he
selects
will
not
want
the
baby
if
i
can
keep
them
going
a
few
months
more
with
a
teething
scare
i
hope
they
will
get
over
wanting
her
if
they
do
then
may
we
have
her
asked
nancy
ellen
kate
threw
out
her
hands
take
my
eyes
or
my
hands
or
my
feet
she
said
but
leave
me
my
heart
nancy
ellen
went
soon
after
and
did
not
come
again
for
several
days
then
she
began
coming
as
usual
so
that
the
baby
soon
knew
her
and
laughed
in
high
glee
when
she
appeared
gray
often
stopped
in
passing
to
see
her
if
he
was
in
great
haste
he
hallooed
at
the
gate
to
ask
if
she
was
all
right
kate
was
thankful
for
this
more
than
thankful
for
the
telephone
and
car
that
would
bring
him
in
fifteen
minutes
day
or
night
if
he
were
needed
but
he
was
not
needed
little
poll
throve
and
grew
fat
and
rosy
for
she
ate
measured
food
slept
by
the
clock
in
a
sanitary
bed
and
was
a
bathed
splendidly
cared
for
baby
when
kate
family
and
friends
laughed
she
paid
not
the
slightest
heed
laugh
away
she
said
i
got
something
to
fight
with
this
baby
i
do
propose
for
the
battle
to
come
and
find
the
chances
against
me
because
i
unprepared
with
scrupulous
care
kate
watched
over
the
child
always
putting
her
first
the
house
and
land
afterward
one
day
she
looked
up
the
road
and
saw
henry
peters
coming
she
had
been
expecting
nancy
ellen
she
had
finished
bathing
the
baby
and
making
her
especially
attractive
in
a
dainty
lace
ruffled
dress
with
blue
ribbons
and
blue
shoes
that
her
sister
had
brought
on
her
latest
trip
little
poll
was
a
wonderful
picture
for
her
eyes
were
always
growing
bigger
her
cheeks
pinker
her
skin
fairer
her
hair
longer
and
more
softly
curling
at
first
thought
kate
had
been
inclined
to
snatch
off
the
dress
and
change
to
one
of
the
cheap
ginghams
henry
brought
but
the
baby
was
so
lovely
as
she
was
she
had
not
the
heart
to
spoil
the
picture
while
nancy
ellen
might
come
any
minute
so
she
began
putting
things
in
place
while
little
poll
sat
crowing
and
trying
to
pick
up
a
sunbeam
that
fell
across
her
tray
her
father
came
to
the
door
and
stood
looking
at
her
suddenly
he
dropped
in
a
chair
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
began
to
cry
in
deep
shuddering
sobs
kate
stood
still
in
wonderment
as
last
she
seated
herself
before
him
and
said
gently
wo
you
tell
me
about
it
henry
henry
struggled
for
he
looked
at
the
baby
longingly
finally
he
said
it
pretty
tough
to
give
up
a
baby
like
that
holt
she
my
little
girl
i
wish
god
had
struck
my
right
hand
with
palsy
when
i
went
to
sign
those
papers
oh
no
you
do
henry
said
kate
suavely
you
would
like
to
live
the
rest
of
your
life
a
cripple
and
is
it
any
worse
for
me
to
have
your
girl
in
spite
of
the
real
desires
and
dictates
of
your
heart
than
it
was
for
you
to
have
mine
and
you
did
take
the
intelligent
care
of
my
girl
that
i
taking
of
yours
either
a
doctor
and
a
little
right
treatment
at
the
proper
time
would
have
saved
polly
to
rear
her
own
baby
but
there
no
use
to
go
into
that
i
was
waiting
for
polly
to
come
home
of
her
own
accord
as
she
left
it
and
while
i
waited
a
poison
crept
into
her
system
that
took
her
i
never
shall
feel
right
about
it
neither
shall
you
no
i
should
say
i
wo
said
henry
emphatically
i
never
thought
of
anything
being
the
matter
with
polly
that
would
be
all
over
when
the
baby
came
i
know
you
did
henry
said
kate
i
know
how
much
you
would
have
done
and
how
gladly
if
you
had
known
there
is
no
use
going
into
that
we
are
both
very
much
to
blame
we
must
take
our
punishment
now
what
is
this
i
hear
about
your
having
been
to
see
lawyers
and
trying
to
find
a
way
to
set
aside
the
adoption
papers
you
signed
let
have
a
talk
and
see
what
we
can
arrive
at
tell
me
all
about
it
so
henry
told
kate
how
he
had
loved
polly
how
he
felt
guilty
of
her
death
how
he
longed
for
and
wanted
her
baby
how
he
had
signed
the
paper
which
polly
put
before
him
so
unexpectedly
to
humour
her
because
she
was
very
ill
but
he
had
not
dreamed
that
she
could
die
how
he
did
not
feel
that
he
should
be
bound
by
that
signature
now
kate
listened
with
the
deepest
sympathy
assenting
to
most
he
said
until
he
was
silent
then
she
sat
thinking
a
long
time
at
last
she
said
henry
if
you
and
polly
had
waited
until
i
came
home
and
told
me
what
you
wanted
and
how
you
felt
i
should
have
gotten
her
ready
and
given
you
a
customary
wedding
and
helped
you
to
start
a
life
that
i
think
would
have
saved
her
to
you
and
to
me
that
is
past
but
the
fact
remains
you
are
hurt
over
giving
up
the
baby
as
you
have
hurt
over
losing
my
daughter
as
i
did
we
are
about
even
on
the
past
do
you
think
i
suppose
we
are
he
said
heavily
that
being
agreed
said
kate
let
us
look
to
the
future
you
want
the
baby
now
i
can
guess
how
much
by
how
much
i
want
her
myself
i
know
your
point
of
view
there
are
two
others
one
is
mine
and
the
other
is
the
baby
i
feel
that
it
is
only
right
and
just
that
i
should
have
this
little
girl
to
replace
the
one
you
took
from
me
in
a
way
far
from
complimentary
to
me
i
feel
that
she
is
mine
because
polly
told
me
the
day
she
came
to
see
me
how
sick
she
had
been
how
she
had
begged
for
a
doctor
and
been
kissed
and
told
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
her
when
she
knew
she
was
very
she
gave
the
baby
to
me
and
at
that
time
she
had
been
to
see
a
lawyer
and
had
her
papers
all
made
out
except
the
signatures
and
dates
thomlins
can
tell
you
that
and
you
know
that
up
to
that
time
i
had
not
seen
polly
or
had
any
communication
with
her
she
simply
was
unnerved
at
the
thought
of
trusting
her
baby
to
the
care
she
had
had
kate
was
hitting
hard
and
straight
from
the
shoulder
the
baby
busy
with
her
sunbeam
jabbered
unnoticed
when
polly
died
as
she
did
continued
kate
i
knew
that
her
baby
would
be
full
of
the
same
poison
that
killed
her
and
that
it
must
be
eliminated
before
it
came
time
to
cut
her
worst
teeth
so
i
undertook
the
work
and
sleeping
or
waking
i
have
been
at
it
ever
since
now
henry
is
there
any
one
at
your
house
who
would
have
figured
this
out
and
taken
the
time
pains
and
done
work
that
i
have
is
there
mother
raised
six
of
us
he
said
defensively
but
she
did
die
of
diathesis
giving
birth
to
the
first
of
you
said
kate
you
were
all
big
strong
boys
with
a
perfectly
sound
birthright
and
your
mother
is
now
a
much
older
wearier
woman
than
she
was
then
and
her
hands
are
far
too
full
every
day
as
it
is
if
she
knew
how
to
handle
the
baby
as
i
have
and
was
willing
to
add
the
work
to
her
daily
round
would
you
be
willing
to
have
her
i
have
three
times
her
strength
while
i
consider
that
i
the
first
right
then
there
is
the
baby
side
of
the
question
i
have
had
her
through
the
worst
hardest
part
of
babyhood
she
is
accustomed
to
a
fixed
routine
that
you
surely
will
concede
agrees
with
her
she
would
miss
me
and
she
would
not
thrive
as
she
does
with
me
for
her
food
and
her
hours
would
not
be
regular
while
you
and
your
father
and
the
boys
would
tire
her
to
death
handling
her
that
is
the
start
the
finish
would
be
that
she
would
grow
up
if
she
survived
to
take
the
place
polly
took
at
your
house
while
you
would
marry
some
other
girl
as
you
will
before
a
year
from
now
i
dreadfully
sorry
to
say
these
things
to
you
henry
but
you
know
they
are
the
truth
if
you
going
to
try
to
take
the
baby
i
going
to
fight
you
to
the
last
dollar
i
can
raise
and
the
last
foot
of
land
i
own
that
all
look
at
the
baby
think
it
over
and
let
me
know
what
you
do
as
soon
as
you
can
not
asking
mercy
at
your
hands
but
i
do
feel
that
i
have
suffered
about
my
share
you
need
suffer
any
longer
said
henry
drying
his
eyes
all
you
say
is
true
just
as
what
i
said
was
true
but
i
might
as
well
tell
you
and
let
one
of
us
be
happy
i
saw
my
third
lawyer
yesterday
and
he
said
the
papers
were
unbreakable
unless
i
could
prove
that
the
child
was
neglected
and
not
growing
right
or
not
having
proper
care
look
at
her
i
might
do
some
things
i
did
do
a
thing
as
mean
as
to
persuade
a
girl
to
marry
me
without
her
mother
knowledge
and
ruined
her
life
thereby
but
god
knows
i
could
go
on
the
witness
stand
and
swear
that
that
baby
is
not
properly
cared
for
mother
job
is
big
enough
and
while
it
does
seem
possible
now
very
likely
i
shall
marry
again
as
other
men
do
and
in
that
event
little
poll
would
be
happier
with
you
i
give
her
up
i
think
i
came
this
morning
to
say
that
i
was
defeated
and
to
tell
you
that
i
give
up
if
i
saw
that
you
would
fight
keep
the
baby
and
be
as
happy
as
you
can
you
sha
be
worried
any
more
about
her
polly
shall
have
this
thing
as
she
desired
and
planned
it
when
he
had
gone
kate
knelt
on
the
floor
laid
her
head
on
the
chair
tray
and
putting
her
arms
around
the
baby
she
laughed
and
cried
at
the
same
time
while
miss
baby
pulled
her
hair
patted
her
face
and
plastered
it
with
wet
uncertain
kisses
then
kate
tied
a
little
bonnet
on
the
baby
head
and
taking
her
in
her
arms
she
went
to
the
field
to
tell
adam
it
seemed
to
kate
that
she
could
see
responsibility
slipping
from
his
shoulders
could
see
him
grow
taller
as
he
listened
the
breath
of
relief
he
drew
was
long
and
deep
fine
he
cried
fine
i
have
told
you
half
i
knew
i
been
worried
until
i
could
sleep
kate
went
back
to
the
house
so
glad
she
did
not
realize
she
was
touching
earth
at
all
she
fed
the
baby
and
laid
her
down
for
her
morning
nap
and
then
went
out
in
the
garden
but
she
was
too
restless
to
work
she
walked
bareheaded
in
the
sun
and
was
glad
as
she
never
before
in
her
life
had
known
how
to
be
glad
the
first
thing
kate
knew
she
was
standing
at
the
gate
looking
up
at
the
noonday
sky
and
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
she
was
crying
aloud
praise
ye
the
lord
oh
my
soul
let
all
that
is
within
me
praise
his
holy
name
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
kate
was
unblushingly
insane
she
started
to
do
a
hundred
things
and
abandoned
all
of
them
to
go
out
and
look
up
at
the
sky
and
to
cry
repeatedly
praise
the
lord
if
she
had
been
asked
to
explain
why
she
did
this
kate
could
have
answered
and
would
have
answered
because
i
feel
like
it
she
had
been
taught
no
religion
as
a
child
she
had
practised
no
formal
mode
of
worship
as
a
woman
she
had
been
straight
honest
and
virtuous
she
had
faced
life
and
done
with
small
question
the
work
that
she
thought
fell
to
her
hand
she
had
accepted
joy
sorrow
shame
all
in
the
same
stoic
way
always
she
had
felt
that
there
was
a
mighty
force
in
the
universe
that
could
as
well
be
called
god
as
any
other
name
it
mattered
not
about
the
name
it
was
a
real
force
and
it
was
there
that
day
kate
exulted
she
carried
the
baby
down
to
the
brook
in
the
afternoon
and
almost
shouted
she
sang
until
she
could
have
been
heard
a
mile
she
kept
straight
on
praising
the
lord
because
expression
was
imperative
and
that
was
the
form
of
expression
that
seemed
to
come
naturally
to
her
without
giving
a
thought
as
to
how
or
why
she
followed
her
impulses
and
praised
the
lord
the
happier
she
grew
the
more
clearly
she
saw
how
uneasy
and
frightened
she
had
been
when
nancy
ellen
came
she
took
only
one
glance
at
kate
glorified
face
and
asked
what
in
this
world
has
happened
to
you
kate
answered
in
all
seriousness
my
lord
has
the
mouths
and
they
are
not
going
to
harm
me
nancy
ellen
regarded
her
closely
i
hope
you
are
running
a
temperature
she
said
i
take
a
shot
at
random
you
have
found
out
that
the
peters
family
ca
take
little
poll
kate
laughed
joyously
better
than
that
sister
mine
she
cried
i
have
convinced
henry
that
he
does
want
her
himself
as
much
as
he
wants
me
to
have
her
and
he
can
speedily
convert
his
family
he
will
do
nothing
more
he
will
leave
me
in
peace
with
her
thank
god
said
nancy
ellen
there
you
go
too
cried
kate
that
the
very
first
thought
that
came
to
me
only
i
said
the
lord
which
is
exactly
the
same
thing
and
nancy
ellen
since
robert
has
been
trying
to
praise
the
lord
for
twenty
years
and
both
of
us
do
praise
him
when
our
time
comes
would
it
be
a
good
idea
to
open
up
our
heads
and
say
so
not
only
to
ourselves
and
to
the
lord
but
to
the
neighbours
i
afraid
she
understand
much
of
it
but
i
think
i
shall
find
the
place
and
read
to
little
poll
about
abraham
and
isaac
and
probably
about
hagar
and
ishmael
night
and
it
would
surprise
me
a
mite
to
hear
myself
saying
the
lord
right
out
loud
any
time
any
place
let
gather
a
great
big
bouquet
of
our
loveliest
flowers
and
go
tell
mother
and
polly
about
it
without
a
word
nancy
ellen
turned
toward
the
garden
they
gathered
the
flowers
and
getting
in
nancy
ellen
car
drove
the
short
distance
to
the
church
where
nancy
ellen
played
with
the
baby
in
the
shade
of
a
big
tree
while
kate
arranged
her
flowers
then
she
sat
down
and
they
talked
over
their
lives
from
childhood
nancy
ellen
wo
you
stay
to
supper
with
us
asked
kate
yes
said
nancy
ellen
rising
i
have
had
such
a
good
time
in
years
i
as
glad
for
you
as
i
be
if
i
had
such
a
child
assured
me
myself
you
ca
bring
yourself
began
kate
yes
i
think
so
said
nancy
ellen
getting
things
for
little
poll
has
broken
me
up
so
i
told
robert
how
i
felt
and
he
watching
in
his
practice
and
he
written
several
letters
of
inquiry
to
friends
in
chicago
any
day
now
i
may
have
my
work
cut
out
for
me
praise
the
lord
again
cried
kate
i
see
where
you
will
be
happier
than
you
ever
have
been
real
life
is
just
beginning
for
you
then
they
went
home
and
prepared
a
good
supper
and
had
such
a
fine
time
they
were
exalted
in
heart
and
spirit
when
nancy
ellen
started
home
kate
took
the
baby
and
climbed
in
the
car
with
her
explaining
that
they
would
go
a
short
way
and
walk
back
she
went
only
as
far
as
the
peters
gate
then
she
bravely
walked
up
to
the
porch
where
peters
and
some
of
the
boys
sat
and
said
casually
i
just
thought
i
bring
little
poll
up
to
get
acquainted
with
her
folks
is
she
a
dear
an
hour
later
as
she
walked
back
in
the
moonlight
henry
beside
her
carrying
the
baby
he
said
to
her
this
is
a
mighty
big
thing
and
a
kind
thing
for
you
to
do
holt
mother
has
been
saying
scandalous
things
about
you
i
know
said
kate
but
never
mind
she
wo
any
more
the
remainder
of
the
week
she
passed
in
the
same
uplifted
mental
state
she
carried
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
walked
all
over
the
farm
going
often
to
the
cemetery
with
fresh
flowers
sunday
morning
when
the
work
was
all
done
the
baby
dressed
her
prettiest
kate
slipped
into
one
of
her
fresh
white
dresses
and
gathering
a
big
bunch
of
flowers
started
again
to
whisper
above
the
graves
of
her
mother
and
polly
the
story
of
her
gladness
and
to
freshen
the
flowers
so
that
the
people
coming
from
church
would
see
that
her
family
were
remembered
when
she
had
finished
she
arose
took
up
the
baby
and
started
to
return
across
the
cemetery
going
behind
the
church
taking
the
path
she
had
travelled
the
day
she
followed
the
minister
admonition
to
take
the
wings
of
morning
she
thought
of
that
she
stood
very
still
thinking
deeply
i
took
them
she
said
i
tried
flight
after
flight
and
fallen
and
risen
and
fallen
and
got
up
and
tried
again
but
never
until
now
have
i
felt
that
i
could
really
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
there
is
a
rising
power
in
me
that
should
benefit
more
than
myself
i
guess
i
just
join
in
she
walked
into
the
church
as
the
last
word
of
the
song
the
congregation
were
singing
was
finished
and
the
minister
was
opening
his
lips
to
say
let
us
pray
straight
down
the
aisle
came
kate
her
bare
gold
head
crowned
with
a
flash
of
light
at
each
window
she
passed
she
paused
at
the
altar
directly
facing
the
minister
baby
and
i
would
like
the
privilege
of
praising
the
lord
with
you
she
said
simply
and
we
would
like
to
do
our
share
in
keeping
up
this
church
and
congregation
to
his
honour
and
glory
there
some
water
ca
you
baptize
us
now
the
minister
turned
to
the
pitcher
which
always
stood
on
his
desk
filled
his
palm
and
asked
what
is
the
baby
name
katherine
eleanor
peters
said
kate
katherine
eleanor
i
baptize
thee
said
the
minister
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
soft
curls
of
the
baby
she
scattered
the
flowers
she
was
holding
over
the
altar
as
she
reached
to
spat
her
hands
in
the
water
on
her
head
and
laughed
aloud
what
is
your
name
asked
the
minister
katherine
eleanor
holt
said
kate
again
the
minister
repeated
the
formula
and
then
he
raised
both
hands
and
said
let
us
pray
chapter
xxvi
the
winged
victory
kate
turned
and
placing
the
baby
on
the
front
seat
she
knelt
and
put
her
arms
around
the
little
thing
but
her
lips
only
repeated
the
words
praise
the
lord
for
this
precious
baby
her
heart
was
filled
with
high
resolve
she
would
rear
the
baby
with
such
care
she
would
be
more
careful
with
adam
she
would
make
heroic
effort
to
help
him
to
clean
unashamed
manhood
she
would
be
a
better
sister
to
all
her
family
she
would
be
friendlier
and
have
more
patience
with
the
neighbours
she
would
join
in
whatever
effort
the
church
was
making
to
hold
and
increase
its
membership
among
the
young
people
and
to
raise
funds
to
keep
up
the
organization
all
the
time
her
mind
was
busy
thinking
out
these
fine
resolves
her
lips
were
thanking
the
lord
for
little
poll
kate
arose
with
the
benediction
picked
up
the
baby
and
started
down
the
aisle
among
the
people
she
had
known
all
her
life
on
every
side
strong
hands
stretched
out
to
greet
and
welcome
her
a
daughter
of
adam
bates
was
something
new
as
a
church
member
they
all
knew
how
she
could
work
and
what
she
could
give
if
she
chose
while
that
she
had
stood
at
the
altar
and
been
baptized
meant
that
something
not
customary
with
the
bates
family
was
taking
place
in
her
heart
so
they
welcomed
her
and
praised
the
beauty
and
sweetness
of
the
baby
until
kate
went
out
into
the
sunshine
her
face
glowing
slowly
she
walked
home
and
as
she
reached
the
veranda
adam
took
the
baby
been
to
the
cemetery
he
asked
kate
nodded
and
dropped
into
a
chair
that
too
far
to
walk
and
carry
this
great
big
woman
he
said
snuggling
his
face
in
the
baby
neck
while
she
patted
his
cheeks
and
pulled
his
hair
why
did
you
tell
me
you
wanted
to
go
and
let
me
get
out
the
car
kate
looked
at
him
speculatively
adam
she
said
when
i
started
out
i
meant
only
to
take
some
flowers
to
mother
and
polly
as
i
came
around
the
corner
of
the
church
to
take
the
footpath
they
were
singing
in
the
lord
i
went
inside
and
joined
i
going
to
church
as
often
as
i
can
after
this
and
i
going
to
help
with
the
work
of
running
it
well
i
like
that
cried
adam
indignantly
why
did
you
let
me
go
with
you
kate
sat
staring
down
the
road
she
was
shocked
speechless
again
she
had
followed
an
impulse
without
thinking
of
any
one
besides
herself
usually
she
could
talk
but
in
that
instant
she
had
nothing
to
say
then
a
carriage
drew
into
the
line
of
her
vision
stopped
at
gate
and
york
alighted
and
swung
to
the
ground
a
slim
girlish
figure
and
then
helped
his
wife
kate
had
a
sudden
inspiration
but
you
would
want
to
wait
a
little
and
join
with
milly
would
you
she
asked
uncle
robert
always
has
been
a
church
member
i
think
it
a
fine
stand
for
a
man
to
take
maybe
that
would
be
better
he
said
i
did
think
of
milly
i
only
thought
i
like
to
have
been
with
you
and
little
poll
i
sure
milly
will
be
joining
very
soon
and
that
she
want
you
with
her
said
kate
she
was
a
very
substantial
woman
but
for
the
remainder
of
that
day
she
felt
that
she
was
moving
with
winged
feet
she
sang
she
laughed
she
was
unspeakably
happy
she
kept
saying
over
and
over
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
then
she
would
catch
little
poll
almost
crushing
her
in
her
strong
arms
it
never
occurred
to
kate
that
she
had
done
an
unprecedented
thing
she
had
done
as
her
heart
dictated
she
did
not
know
that
she
put
the
minister
into
a
most
uncomfortable
position
when
he
followed
her
request
to
baptize
her
and
the
child
she
had
never
thought
of
probations
and
examinations
and
catechisms
she
had
read
the
bible
as
was
the
custom
every
morning
before
her
school
in
that
book
when
a
man
wanted
to
follow
jesus
he
followed
jesus
accepted
him
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
with
kate
the
middle
of
the
week
nancy
ellen
came
flying
up
the
walk
on
winged
feet
herself
she
carried
photographs
of
several
small
children
one
of
them
a
girl
so
like
little
poll
that
she
might
have
been
the
original
of
the
picture
they
just
came
said
nancy
ellen
rather
breathlessly
i
was
wild
for
that
little
darling
at
once
i
had
robert
telegraph
them
to
hold
her
until
we
could
get
there
we
going
to
start
on
the
evening
train
and
if
her
blood
seems
good
and
her
ancestors
respectable
and
she
looks
like
that
picture
we
going
to
bring
her
back
with
us
oh
kate
i
can
scarcely
wait
to
get
my
fingers
on
her
i
hungry
for
a
baby
all
of
my
own
kate
studied
the
picture
she
charming
she
said
oh
nancy
ellen
this
world
is
getting
entirely
too
good
to
be
true
nancy
ellen
looked
at
kate
and
smiled
peculiarly
i
knew
you
were
crazy
she
said
but
i
never
dreamed
of
you
going
such
lengths
whistler
told
robert
when
she
called
him
in
about
her
side
tuesday
i
ca
imagine
a
bates
joining
church
if
that
is
joining
church
it
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
said
kate
we
just
loved
doing
it
did
we
little
poll
adam
and
milly
are
going
to
come
in
soon
i
almost
sure
at
least
he
is
willing
i
do
know
what
it
is
that
i
am
to
do
but
i
suppose
they
will
give
me
my
work
soon
you
bet
they
give
you
work
soon
and
enough
said
nancy
ellen
laughing
but
you
wo
mind
you
just
put
it
through
as
you
do
things
out
here
kate
you
are
making
this
place
look
fine
i
used
to
say
i
rather
die
than
come
back
here
to
live
but
lately
it
has
been
growing
so
attractive
i
been
here
about
half
my
time
and
wished
i
were
the
other
half
kate
slipped
her
arm
around
nancy
ellen
as
they
walked
to
the
gate
you
know
said
nancy
ellen
the
more
i
study
you
the
less
i
know
about
you
usually
it
sickness
and
sorrow
and
losing
their
friends
that
bring
people
to
the
consolations
of
the
church
you
bore
those
things
like
a
stoic
when
they
are
all
over
and
you
are
comfortable
and
happy
just
the
joy
of
being
sure
of
little
poll
has
transformed
you
kate
you
make
me
think
of
the
victory
this
afternoon
if
i
get
this
darling
little
girl
will
she
make
me
big
and
splendid
and
fine
like
you
kate
suddenly
drew
nancy
ellen
to
her
and
kissed
her
a
long
hard
kiss
on
the
lips
nancy
ellen
she
said
you
are
and
splendid
and
fine
or
you
never
would
be
going
to
chicago
after
this
little
motherless
child
you
have
said
a
word
but
i
know
from
the
joy
of
you
and
robert
during
the
past
months
that
southey
is
troubling
you
any
more
and
i
sure
enough
to
put
it
into
words
that
when
you
get
your
little
child
she
will
lead
you
straight
where
mine
as
led
me
and
good
luck
to
you
and
remember
me
to
robert
nancy
ellen
stood
intently
studying
the
picture
she
held
in
her
hand
then
she
looked
at
kate
smiling
with
misty
eyes
i
think
kate
very
close
if
i
am
not
really
where
you
are
this
minute
she
said
then
she
started
her
car
but
she
looked
back
waving
and
smiling
until
the
car
swerved
so
that
kate
called
after
her
do
drive
carefully
nancy
ellen
kate
went
slowly
up
the
walk
she
stopped
several
times
to
examine
the
shrubs
and
bushes
closely
to
wish
for
rain
for
the
flowers
she
sat
on
the
porch
a
few
minutes
talking
to
little
poll
then
she
went
inside
to
answer
the
phone
kate
cried
a
sharp
voice
yes
said
kate
recognizing
a
neighbour
living
a
few
miles
down
the
road
did
nancy
ellen
just
leave
your
house
came
a
breathless
query
yes
said
kate
again
i
just
saw
a
car
that
looked
like
hers
slip
in
the
fresh
sand
at
the
river
levee
and
it
went
down
and
two
or
three
times
over

at
the
little
garage
they
had
built
and
had
the
door
open
she
told
him
what
she
had
heard
ran
to
get
the
baby
and
met
him
at
the
gate
on
the
way
she
said

take
the
baby
when
we
get
there
and
if
i
needed
take
her
back
and
get
milly
and
her
mother

let
them

any
way
i
do
baby

milly
she
will
be
good
for
her
and
for
you

be
careful
of
course
mother
said
adam
he
called
her
attention
to
the
road
look
at
those
tracks
he
said
was
she
sick
she
might
have
been
drunk
from
them
no
said
kate
she
was
sick
she
was
drunk
drunken
with
joy
she
had
a
picture
of
the
most
beautiful
little
baby
girl
they
were
to
start
to
chicago
after
her
i
suspect
she
was
driving
with
the
picture
in
one
hand
oh
my
god
have
mercy
they
had
come
to
deep
grooves
in
loose
gravel
then
the
cut
in
the
embankment
then
they
could
see
the
wrecked
car
standing
on
the
engine
and
lying
against
a
big
tree
near
the
water
while
two
men
and
a
woman
were
carrying
a
limp
form
across
the
meadow
toward
the
house
as
their
car
stopped
kate
kissed
the
baby
mechanically
handed
her
to
adam
and
ran
into
the
house
where
she
dragged
a
couch
to
the
middle
of
the
first
room
she
entered
found
a
pillow
and
brought
a
bucket
of
water
and
a
towel
from
the
kitchen
they
carried
nancy
ellen
in
and
laid
her
down
kate
began
unfastening
clothing
and
trying
to
get
the
broken
body
in
shape
for
the
doctor
to
work
upon
but
she
spread
the
towel
over
what
had
been
a
face
of
unusual
beauty
robert
came
in
a
few
minutes
then
all
of
them
worked
under
his
directions
until
he
suddenly
sank
to
the
floor
burying
his
face
in
nancy
ellen
breast
then
they
knew
kate
gathered
her
sister
feet
in
her
arms
and
hid
her
face
beside
them
the
neighbours
silently
began
taking
away
things
that
had
been
used
while
howe
chose
her
whitest
sheet
and
laid
it
on
a
chair
near
robert
two
days
later
they
laid
nancy
ellen
beside
her
mother
then
they
began
trying
to
face
the
problem
of
life
without
her
robert
said
nothing
he
seemed
too
stunned
to
think
kate
wanted
to
tell
him
of
her
final
visit
with
nancy
ellen
but
she
could
not
at
that
time
robert
aged
mother
came
to
him
and
said
she
could
remain
as
long
as
he
wanted
her
so
that
was
a
comfort
to
kate
who
took
time
to
pity
him
even
in
her
blackest
hour
she
had
some
very
black
ones
she
could
have
wailed
and
lamented
and
relinquished
all
she
had
gained
but
she
did
not
she
merely
went
on
with
life
as
she
always
had
lived
it
to
the
best
of
her
ability
when
she
was
so
numbed
with
grief
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
was
doing
she
kept
herself
driven
about
the
house
and
when
she
could
find
no
more
to
do
took
little
poll
in
her
arms
and
went
out
in
the
fields
to
adam
where
she
found
the
baby
a
safe
place
and
then
cut
and
husked
corn
as
usual
every
sabbath
and
often
during
the
week
her
feet
carried
her
to
the
cemetery
where
she
sat
in
the
deep
grass
and
looked
at
those
three
long
mounds
and
tried
to
understand
life
deeper
still
to
fathom
death
she
and
her
mother
had
agreed
that
there
was
something
now
kate
tried
as
never
before
to
understand
what
and
where
and
why
that
something
was
many
days
she
would
sit
for
an
hour
at
a
time
thinking
and
at
last
she
arrived
at
fixed
convictions
that
settled
matters
forever
with
her
one
day
after
she
had
arranged
the
fall
roses
she
had
grown
and
some
roadside
asters
she
had
gathered
in
passing
she
sat
in
deep
thought
when
a
car
stopped
on
the
road
kate
looked
up
to
see
robert
coming
across
the
churchyard
with
his
arms
full
of
greenhouse
roses
he
carried
a
big
bunch
of
deep
red
for
her
mother
white
for
polly
and
a
large
sheaf
of
warm
pink
for
nancy
ellen
kate
knelt
up
and
taking
her
flowers
she
moved
them
lower
and
silently
helped
robert
place
those
he
had
brought
then
she
sat
where
she
had
been
and
looked
at
him
finally
he
asked
still
hunting
the
kate
does
so
much
matter
said
kate
as
i
enough
of
a
fatalist
to
believe
that
mother
is
here
because
she
was
old
and
worn
out
polly
had
a
clear
case
of
uric
poison
while
i
stake
my
life
nancy
ellen
was
gloating
over
the
picture
she
carried
when
she
ran
into
that
loose
sand
in
each
of
their
cases
i
am
satisfied
as
to
as
well
as
about
father
the
thing
that
holds
me
and
fascinates
me
and
that
i
have
such
a
time
being
sure
of
is
robert
glanced
upward
and
asked
is
there
room
enough
up
there
kate
too
much
said
kate
and
what
is
the
soul
and
how
can
it
bridge
the
vortex
lying
between
us
and
other
worlds
that
man
never
can
because
of
the
lack
of
air
to
breathe
and
support
him
i
do
know
said
robert
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
do
know
what
a
man
can
not
do
i
still
believe
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
oh
yes
said
kate
if
there
is
any
such
thing
in
science
as
a
fact
that
is
one
that
is
provable
robert
looked
at
her
eager
face
how
would
you
go
about
proving
it
kate
he
asked
why
this
way
said
kate
leaning
to
straighten
and
arrange
the
delicate
velvet
petalled
roses
with
her
sure
fingers
take
the
history
of
the
world
from
as
near
dawn
as
we
have
any
record
and
trace
it
from
the
igloo
of
the
northernmost
esquimo
around
the
globe
and
down
to
the
ice
of
the
southern
pole
again
and
in
blackest
africa
farthest
wildest
borneo
you
will
never
discover
one
single
tribe
of
creatures
upright
and
belonging
to
the
race
of
man
who
did
not
come
into
the
world
with
four
primal
instincts
they
all
reproduce
themselves
they
all
make
something
intended
for
music
they
all
express
a
feeling
in
their
hearts
by
the
exercise
we
call
dance
they
all
believe
in
the
after
life
of
the
soul
this
belief
is
as
much
a
part
of
any
man
ever
born
in
any
location
as
his
hands
and
his
feet
whether
he
believes
his
soul
enters
a
cat
and
works
back
to
man
again
after
long
transmigration
or
goes
to
a
happy
hunting
ground
as
our
indians
makes
no
difference
with
the
fact
that
he
enters
this
world
with
belief
in
after
life
of
some
kind
we
see
material
evidence
in
increase
that
man
is
not
defeated
in
his
desire
to
reproduce
himself
we
have
advanced
to
something
better
than
and
for
music
and
dance
these
desires
are
fulfilled
before
us
now
tell
me
why
the
very
strongest
of
all
the
most
deeply
rooted
the
belief
in
after
life
should
come
to
nothing
why
should
the
others
be
real
and
that
a
dream
i
do
think
it
is
said
robert
it
my
biggest
fact
said
kate
conclusively
i
never
heard
any
one
else
say
these
things
but
i
think
them
and
they
are
provable
i
always
believed
there
was
something
but
since
i
saw
mother
go
i
know
there
is
she
stood
in
full
evening
light
i
looked
straight
in
her
face
and
robert
you
know
i
no
creature
of
fancies
and
delusions
i
tell
you
i
saw
her
soul
pass
i
saw
the
life
go
from
her
and
go
on
and
on
i
saw
her
body
stand
erect
long
enough
for
me
to
reach
her
and
pick
her
up
after
its
passing
that
i
know
i
should
think
of
questioning
it
kate
said
robert
but
you
think
you
are
rather
limiting
man
when
you
narrow
him
to
four
primal
instincts
oh
i
do
know
said
kate
air
to
breathe
and
food
to
sustain
are
presupposed
man
learns
to
fight
in
and
to
acquire
what
he
covets
he
learns
to
covet
by
seeing
stronger
men
in
better
locations
surpass
his
achievements
so
if
he
is
strong
enough
he
goes
and
robs
them
by
force
he
learns
the
desire
for
the
chase
in
food
hunting
i
think
four
are
plenty
to
start
with
probably
you
are
right
said
the
doctor
rising
i
must
go
now
shall
i
take
you
home
kate
glanced
at
the
sun
and
shook
her
head
i
can
stay
half
an
hour
longer
i
do
mind
the
walk
i
need
exercise
to
keep
me
in
condition
as
he
started
his
car
he
glanced
back
she
was
leaning
over
the
flowers
absorbed
in
their
beauty
kate
sat
looking
straight
before
her
until
time
to
help
with
the
evening
work
and
prepare
supper
then
she
arose
she
stood
looking
down
a
long
time
finally
she
picked
up
a
fine
specimen
of
each
of
the
roses
and
slowly
dropped
them
on
her
father
grave
there
you
may
have
that
many
she
said
you
look
a
little
too
lonely
lying
here
beside
the
others
with
not
a
single
one
but
if
you
could
speak
i
wonder
whether
you
would
say
you
or
the
damn
weeds
off
me
chapter
xxvii
blue
ribbon
corn
never
in
her
life
had
kate
worked
harder
than
she
did
that
fall
but
she
retained
her
splendid
health
everything
was
sheltered
and
housed
their
implements
under
cover
their
stock
in
good
condition
their
filled
and
their
fruits
and
vegetables
buried
in
hills
and
long
rows
in
the
garden
adam
had
a
first
wheat
premium
at
the
county
fair
and
a
second
on
corn
concerning
which
he
felt
abused
he
thought
his
corn
scored
the
highest
number
of
points
but
that
the
award
was
given
another
man
because
of
adam
having
had
first
on
wheat
in
her
heart
kate
agreed
with
him
but
she
tried
to
satisfy
him
with
the
blue
ribbon
on
wheat
and
keep
him
interested
sufficiently
to
try
for
the
first
on
corn
the
coming
year
she
began
making
suggestions
for
the
possible
improvement
of
his
corn
adam
was
not
easily
propitiated
mother
he
said
you
know
as
well
as
you
know
you
alive
that
if
i
had
failed
on
wheat
or
had
second
i
would
have
been
given
first
on
my
corn
my
corn
was
the
best
in
every
way
but
they
thought
i
would
swell
up
and
burst
if
i
had
two
blue
ribbons
that
was
what
ailed
the
judges
what
encouragement
is
that
to
try
again
i
might
grow
even
finer
corn
in
the
coming
year
than
i
did
this
and
be
given
no
award
at
all
because
i
had
two
this
year
it
would
amount
to
exactly
the
same
thing
we
get
some
more
books
and
see
if
we
can
study
up
any
new
wrinkles
this
winter
said
kate
now
cheer
up
and
go
tell
milly
about
it
maybe
she
can
console
you
if
i
ca
nothing
but
justice
will
console
me
said
adam
i
not
complaining
about
losing
the
prize
i
fighting
mad
because
my
corn
my
beautiful
corn
that
grew
and
grew
and
held
its
head
so
high
and
waved
its
banners
of
triumph
to
me
with
every
breeze
did
get
its
fair
show
what
encouragement
is
there
for
it
to
try
better
the
coming
year
the
crows
might
as
well
have
had
it
or
the
cutworms
while
all
my
work
is
for
nothing
you
making
a
big
mistake
said
kate
if
your
corn
was
the
finest
it
was
and
the
judges
knew
it
and
you
know
it
and
very
likely
the
man
who
has
the
first
prize
knows
it
you
have
a
clean
conscience
and
you
know
what
you
know
they
surely
ca
feel
right
about
it
or
enjoy
what
they
know
you
have
had
the
experience
you
have
the
corn
for
seed
with
these
things
to
back
you
clear
a
small
strip
of
new
land
beside
the
woods
this
winter
and
try
what
that
will
do
for
you
adam
looked
at
her
with
wide
eyes
by
jing
mother
you
are
a
dandy
he
said
you
just
bet
i
try
that
next
year
but
do
you
tell
a
soul
there
are
more
than
you
who
will
let
a
strip
be
cleared
in
an
effort
to
grow
blue
ribbon
corn
how
did
you
come
to
think
of
it
your
saying
all
your
work
had
been
for
nothing
made
me
think
of
it
she
answered
let
them
give
another
man
the
prize
when
they
know
your
corn
is
the
best
it
their
way
of
keeping
a
larger
number
of
people
interested
and
avoiding
the
appearance
of
partiality
this
contest
was
too
close
next
year
you
grow
such
corn
that
the
corn
will
force
the
decision
in
spite
of
the
judges
do
you
see
i
see
said
adam
i
try
again
after
that
life
went
on
as
usual
the
annual
christmas
party
was
the
loveliest
of
all
because
kate
gave
it
loving
thought
and
because
all
of
their
hearts
were
especially
touched
as
spring
came
on
again
kate
and
adam
studied
over
their
work
planning
many
changes
for
the
better
but
each
time
they
talked
when
everything
else
was
arranged
they
came
back
to
corn
more
than
once
each
of
them
dreamed
corn
that
winter
while
asleep
they
frankly
talked
of
it
many
times
a
day
location
soil
fertilizers
seed
cultivation
they
even
studied
the
almanacs
for
a
general
forecast
of
the
weather
these
things
brought
them
very
close
together
also
it
was
admitted
between
them
that
little
poll
grappled
them
with
hooks
of
steel
they
never
lacked
subjects
for
conversation
poll
always
came
first
corn
next
and
during
the
winter
there
began
to
be
discussion
of
plans
for
adam
and
milly
should
milly
come
with
them
or
should
they
build
a
small
house
on
the
end
of
the
farm
nearest
her
mother
adam
did
not
care
so
he
married
milly
speedily
kate
could
not
make
up
her
mind
milly
had
the
inclination
of
a
bird
for
a
personal
and
private
nest
of
her
own
so
spring
came
to
them
august
brought
the
anniversary
of
nancy
ellen
death
which
again
saddened
all
of
them
then
came
cooler
september
weather
and
the
usual
rush
of
preparation
for
winter
kate
was
everywhere
and
enjoying
her
work
immensely
on
sturdy
tumbly
legs
little
poll
trotted
after
her
or
rode
in
state
on
her
shoulder
when
distances
were
too
far
if
kate
took
her
to
the
fields
as
she
did
every
day
she
carried
along
the
half
of
an
old
pink
and
white
quilt
which
she
spread
in
a
shaded
place
and
filled
the
baby
lap
with
acorns
wild
flowers
small
brightly
coloured
stones
shells
and
whatever
she
could
pick
up
for
playthings
poll
amused
herself
with
these
until
the
heat
and
air
made
her
sleepy
then
she
laid
herself
down
and
slept
for
an
hour
or
two
once
she
had
trouble
with
stomach
teeth
that
brought
gray
racing
and
left
kate
white
and
limp
with
fear
everything
else
had
gone
finely
and
among
helping
adam
working
in
her
home
caring
for
the
baby
doing
whatever
she
could
see
that
she
thought
would
be
of
benefit
to
the
community
and
what
was
assigned
her
by
church
committees
kate
had
a
busy
life
she
had
earned
in
a
degree
the
leadership
she
exercised
in
her
first
days
in
walden
everyone
liked
her
but
no
one
ever
ventured
to
ask
her
for
an
opinion
unless
they
truly
wanted
it
adam
came
from
a
run
to
hartley
for
groceries
one
evening
in
late
september
with
a
look
of
concern
that
kate
noticed
on
his
face
he
was
very
silent
during
supper
and
when
they
were
on
the
porch
as
usual
he
still
sat
as
if
thinking
deeply
kate
knew
that
he
would
tell
her
what
he
was
thinking
about
when
he
was
ready
but
she
was
not
in
the
least
prepared
for
what
he
said
mother
how
do
you
feel
about
uncle
robert
marrying
again
he
asked
suddenly
kate
was
too
surprised
to
answer
she
looked
at
him
in
amazement
instead
of
answering
she
asked
him
a
question
what
makes
you
ask
that
you
know
how
that
southey
pursued
him
one
summer
well
back
in
hartley
staying
at
the
hotel
right
across
from
his
office
she
dressed
to
beat
the
band
she
pretty
as
a
picture
her
car
stands
out
in
front
all
day
and
to
get
to
ride
in
it
and
take
meals
with
her
all
the
women
are
running
after
her
i
hear
she
has
even
had
robert
old
mother
out
for
a
drive
what
do
you
think
of
that
think
she
in
love
with
him
of
course
and
trying
to
marry
him
and
that
she
will
very
probably
succeed
if
she
has
located
where
she
is
right
under
his
eye
and
lets
him
know
that
she
wants
him
very
much
he
no
doubt
marry
her
but
what
do
you
think
about
it
asked
adam
i
had
no
time
to
think
said
kate
at
first
blush
i
say
that
i
shall
hate
it
as
badly
as
i
could
possibly
hate
anything
that
was
none
of
my
immediate
business
nancy
ellen
loved
him
so
i
never
shall
forget
that
day
she
first
told
me
about
him
and
how
loving
him
brought
out
her
beauty
and
made
her
shine
and
glow
as
if
from
an
inner
light
i
was
always
with
her
most
and
i
loved
her
more
than
all
the
other
girls
put
together
i
know
that
southey
woman
tried
to
take
him
from
her
one
summer
not
long
ago
and
that
he
gave
her
to
understand
that
she
could
not
so
she
went
away
if
she
back
it
means
only
one
thing
and
i
think
probably
she
succeed
but
you
can
be
sure
it
will
make
me
squirm
properly
i
thought
you
would
like
it
he
said
emphatically
now
understand
me
adam
said
kate
i
no
fool
i
did
expect
robert
to
be
more
than
human
he
has
no
children
and
he
like
a
child
above
anything
else
on
earth
i
known
that
for
years
ever
since
it
became
apparent
that
none
was
coming
to
nancy
ellen
i
given
the
matter
a
thought
but
if
i
had
been
thinking
i
would
have
thought
that
as
soon
as
was
proper
he
would
select
a
strong
healthy
young
woman
and
make
her
his
wife
i
know
his
mother
is
homesick
and
wants
to
go
back
to
her
daughters
and
their
children
which
is
natural
i
have
an
objection
in
the
world
to
him
marrying
a
proper
woman
at
a
proper
time
and
place
but
oh
dear
lord
i
do
dread
and
despise
to
see
that
little
southey
cat
come
back
and
catch
him
because
she
knows
how
did
you
ever
see
her
mother
no
i
never
said
kate
and
i
hope
i
never
shall
i
know
what
nancy
ellen
felt
because
she
told
me
all
about
it
that
time
we
were
up
north
i
trying
with
all
my
might
to
have
a
christian
spirit
i
swallowed
peters
and
never
blinked
that
anybody
saw
but
i
do
i
truly
do
know
from
where
i
could
muster
grace
to
treat
a
woman
decently
who
tried
to
do
to
my
sister
what
i
know
southey
tried
to
do
to
nancy
ellen
she
planned
to
break
up
my
sister
home
that
i
know
now
that
nancy
ellen
is
gone
i
feel
as
if
i
just
could
endure
to
see
southey
marry
robert
bet
she
does
it
said
adam
did
you
see
her
asked
kate
see
her
cried
adam
i
saw
her
half
a
dozen
times
in
an
hour
in
the
heart
of
the
town
nothing
to
do
but
dress
and
motor
never
saw
such
a
peach
of
a
car
i
could
help
looking
at
it
gee
i
wish
i
could
get
you
one
like
that
what
did
you
think
of
her
looks
asked
kate
might
pretty
said
adam
promptly
small
but
not
tiny
plump
but
not
fat
pink
light
curls
big
baby
blue
eyes
and
a
sort
of
hesitating
way
about
her
as
if
she
were
anxious
to
do
the
right
thing
but
feared
she
might
not
and
wished
somebody
would
take
care
of
her
kate
threw
out
her
hands
with
a
rough
exclamation
i
get
the
picture
she
said
it
a
dead
centre
shot
that
gets
a
man
every
time
no
man
cares
a
picayune
about
a
woman
who
can
take
care
of
herself
and
help
him
with
his
job
if
he
has
a
ghost
of
a
chance
at
a
little
pink
and
white
clinger
who
will
suck
the
life
and
talent
out
of
him
like
the
parasite
she
is
while
she
makes
him
believe
he
is
on
the
job
taking
care
of
her
you
can
rest
assured
it
will
be
settled
before
christmas
kate
had
been
right
in
her
theories
concerning
the
growing
of
blue
ribbon
corn
at
the
county
fair
in
late
september
adam
exhibited
such
heavy
ears
of
evenly
grained
white
and
yellow
corn
that
the
blue
ribbon
he
carried
home
was
not
an
award
of
the
judges
it
was
a
concession
to
the
just
demands
of
the
exhibit
then
they
began
husking
their
annual
crop
it
had
been
one
of
the
country
best
years
for
corn
the
long
even
golden
ears
they
were
stripping
the
husks
from
and
stacking
in
heaps
over
the
field
might
profitably
have
been
used
for
seed
by
any
farmer
they
had
divided
the
field
in
halves
and
adam
was
husking
one
side
kate
the
other
she
had
a
big
shock
open
and
kneeling
beside
it
she
was
busy
stripping
open
the
husks
and
heaping
up
the
yellow
ears
behind
her
the
shocks
stood
like
rows
of
stationed
sentinels
above
the
crisp
october
sunshine
warmed
the
air
to
a
delightful
degree
around
the
field
the
fence
rows
were
filled
with
purple
and
rose
coloured
asters
and
everywhere
goldenrod
yellower
than
the
corn
was
hanging
in
heavy
heads
of
bloom
on
her
old
pink
quilt
little
poll
sound
asleep
was
lifted
from
the
shade
of
one
shock
to
another
while
kate
worked
across
her
share
of
the
field
as
she
worked
she
kept
looking
at
the
child
she
frankly
adored
her
but
she
kept
her
reason
and
held
to
rigid
rules
in
feeding
bathing
and
dressing
poll
minded
even
a
gesture
or
a
nod
above
the
flocking
larks
pierced
the
air
with
silver
notes
on
the
the
gathering
robins
called
to
each
other
high
in
the
air
the
old
black
vulture
that
homed
in
a
hollow
log
in
kate
woods
looked
down
on
the
spots
of
colour
made
by
the
pink
quilt
the
gold
corn
the
blue
of
kate
dress
and
her
yellow
head
an
artist
would
have
paused
long
over
the
rich
colour
the
grouping
and
perspective
of
that
picture
while
the
hazy
fall
atmosphere
softened
and
blended
the
whole
kate
herself
never
had
appeared
or
felt
better
she
worked
rapidly
often
glancing
across
the
field
to
see
if
she
was
even
with
or
slightly
in
advance
of
adam
she
said
it
would
never
do
to
let
the
boy
get
heady
so
she
made
a
point
of
keeping
even
with
him
and
caring
for
little
poll
for
good
measure
she
was
smiling
as
she
watched
him
working
like
a
machine
as
he
ripped
open
husks
gave
the
ear
a
twist
tossed
it
aside
and
reached
for
the
next
kate
was
doing
the
same
thing
quite
as
automatically
she
was
beginning
to
find
the
afternoon
sun
almost
hot
on
her
bare
head
so
she
turned
until
it
fell
on
her
back
her
face
was
flushed
to
coral
pink
and
framed
in
a
loose
border
of
her
beautiful
hair
she
was
smiling
at
the
thought
of
how
adam
was
working
to
get
ahead
of
her
smiling
because
little
poll
looked
such
a
picture
of
healthy
loveliness
smiling
because
she
was
so
well
she
felt
health
rising
like
a
stimulating
tide
in
her
body
smiling
because
the
corn
was
the
finest
she
ever
had
seen
in
a
commonly
cultivated
field
smiling
because
she
and
adam
were
of
one
accord
about
everything
smiling
because
the
day
was
very
beautiful
because
her
heart
was
at
peace
her
conscience
clear
she
heard
a
car
stop
at
her
gate
saw
a
man
alight
and
start
across
the
yard
toward
the
field
and
knew
that
her
visitor
had
seen
her
and
was
coming
to
her
kate
went
on
husking
corn
and
when
the
man
swung
over
the
fence
of
the
field
she
saw
that
he
was
robert
and
instantly
thought
of
southey
so
she
ceased
to
smile
i
got
a
big
notion
to
tell
him
what
i
think
of
him
she
said
to
herself
even
as
she
looked
up
to
greet
him
instantly
she
saw
that
he
had
come
for
something
what
is
it
she
asked
agatha
he
said
she
been
having
some
severe
heart
attacks
lately
and
she
just
gave
me
a
real
scare
instantly
kate
forgot
everything
except
agatha
whom
she
cordially
liked
and
robert
who
appeared
older
more
tired
and
worried
than
she
ever
had
seen
him
she
thought
agatha
had
given
him
a
real
scare
and
she
decided
that
it
scarcely
would
have
been
bad
enough
to
put
lines
in
his
face
she
never
had
noticed
before
dark
circles
under
his
eyes
a
look
of
weariness
in
his
bearing
she
doubted
as
she
looked
at
him
if
he
were
really
courting
southey
even
as
she
thought
of
these
things
she
was
asking
she
better
now
yes
easier
but
she
suffered
terribly
adam
was
upset
completely
adam
and
susan
and
their
families
are
away
from
home
and
wo
be
back
for
a
few
days
unless
i
send
for
them
they
went
to
ohio
to
visit
some
friends
i
stopped
to
ask
if
it
would
be
possible
for
you
to
go
down
this
evening
and
sleep
there
so
that
if
there
did
happen
to
be
a
recurrence
adam
would
be
alone
of
course
said
kate
glancing
at
the
baby
i
go
right
away
no
need
for
that
he
said
if
you
arrange
to
stay
with
adam
as
a
precaution
you
need
go
till
i
going
back
after
supper
to
put
them
in
shape
for
the
night
i
almost
sure
she
be
all
right
now
but
you
know
how
frightened
we
can
get
about
those
we
love
yes
i
know
said
kate
quietly
going
straight
on
ripping
open
ear
after
ear
of
corn
presently
she
wondered
why
he
did
not
go
she
looked
up
at
him
and
met
his
eyes
he
was
studying
her
intently
kate
was
vividly
conscious
in
an
instant
of
her
bare
head
her
husking
gloves
she
was
not
at
all
sure
that
her
face
was
clean
she
smiled
at
him
and
picking
up
the
sunbonnet
lying
beside
her
she
wiped
her
face
with
the
skirt
if
this
sun
hits
too
long
on
the
same
spot
it
grows
warm
she
told
him
kate
i
do
wish
you
would
he
exclaimed
abruptly
kate
was
too
forthright
for
sparring
why
not
she
asked
for
one
thing
you
are
doing
a
man
work
he
said
for
another
i
hate
to
see
you
burn
the
loveliest
hair
i
ever
saw
on
the
head
of
a
woman
and
coarsen
your
fine
skin
kate
looked
down
at
the
ear
of
corn
she
held
in
her
hands
and
considered
an
instant
there
has
any
man
been
around
asking
to
relieve
me
of
this
work
she
said
i
got
my
start
in
life
doing
a
man
work
and
i
frank
to
say
that
i
far
rather
do
it
any
day
than
what
is
usually
considered
a
woman
as
for
my
looks
i
never
set
a
price
on
them
or
let
them
interfere
with
business
robert
no
i
know
you
do
he
said
but
it
a
pity
to
spoil
you
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
you
said
kate
patiently
she
bent
her
head
toward
him
feel
she
said
and
see
if
my
hair
soft
and
fine
i
always
cover
it
in
really
burning
sun
this
autumn
haze
is
good
for
it
my
complexion
is
exactly
as
smooth
and
even
now
as
it
was
the
day
i
first
met
you
on
the
footlog
over
twenty
years
ago
there
one
good
thing
about
the
bates
women
they
wear
well
none
of
us
yet
have
ever
faded
and
frazzled
out
have
you
got
many
hartley
women
doing
what
you
call
women
work
to
compare
with
me
physically
robert
you
know
the
answer
to
that
he
said
so
i
do
said
kate
i
see
some
of
them
occasionally
when
business
calls
me
that
way
now
robert
i
so
well
i
feel
like
running
a
footrace
the
first
thing
when
i
wake
up
every
morning
i
making
money
i
starting
my
boy
in
a
safe
useful
life
have
you
many
year
and
a
half
babies
in
your
practice
that
can
beat
little
poll
i
as
happy
as
it
humanly
possible
for
me
to
be
without
mother
and
polly
and
nancy
ellen
mother
used
always
to
say
that
when
death
struck
a
family
it
seldom
stopped
until
it
took
three
that
was
my
experience
and
saving
adam
and
little
poll
it
took
my
three
dearest
but
the
separation
is
going
to
be
so
very
long
if
i
were
you
i
worry
about
me
robert
there
are
many
women
in
the
world
willing
to
pay
for
your
consideration
save
it
for
them
kate
i
sorry
i
said
anything
he
said
hastily
i
would
offend
you
purposely
you
know
kate
looked
at
him
in
surprise
but
i
not
offended
she
said
snapping
an
ear
and
reaching
for
another
i
am
merely
telling
you
do
give
me
a
thought
i
all
right
if
you
save
me
an
hour
the
next
time
little
poll
has
a
tooth
coming
through
you
have
completely
earned
my
gratitude
tell
agatha
i
come
as
soon
as
i
finish
my
evening
work
that
was
clearly
a
dismissal
for
kate
glancing
across
the
field
toward
adam
saw
that
he
had
advanced
to
a
new
shock
so
she
began
husking
faster
than
before
chapter
xxviii
the
eleventh
hour
robert
said
and
started
back
toward
his
car
kate
looked
after
him
as
he
reached
the
fence
a
surge
of
pity
for
him
swept
up
in
her
heart
he
seemed
far
from
happy
and
he
surely
was
very
tired
impulsive
as
always
she
lifted
her
clear
voice
and
called
robert
he
paused
with
his
foot
on
a
rail
of
the
fence
and
turned
toward
her
have
you
had
any
dinner
she
asked
he
seemed
to
be
considering
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
believe
i
have
he
said
i
thought
you
looked
neglected
said
kate
sonny
across
the
field
is
starting
a
shock
ahead
of
me
i
ca
come
but
go
to
the
kitchen
the
door
is
unlocked
you
find
fried
chicken
and
some
preserves
and
pickles
in
the
pantry
the
bread
box
is
right
there
and
the
milk
and
butter
are
in
the
spring
house
he
gave
kate
one
long
look
thank
you
he
said
and
leaped
the
fence
he
stopped
on
the
front
walk
and
stood
a
minute
then
he
turned
and
went
around
the
house
she
laughed
aloud
she
was
sending
him
to
chicken
perfectly
cooked
barely
cold
melon
preserves
pickled
cucumbers
and
bread
like
that
which
had
for
years
taken
a
county
fair
prize
each
fall
butter
yellow
as
the
goldenrod
lining
the
fences
and
cream
stiff
enough
to
stand
alone
also
he
would
find
neither
germ
nor
mould
in
her
pantry
and
spring
house
while
it
would
be
a
new
experience
for
him
to
let
him
wait
on
himself
kate
husked
away
in
high
good
humour
but
she
quit
an
hour
early
to
be
on
time
to
go
to
agatha
she
explained
this
to
adam
when
she
told
him
that
he
would
have
to
milk
alone
while
she
bathed
and
dressed
herself
and
got
supper
when
she
began
to
dress
kate
examined
her
hair
minutely
and
combed
it
with
unusual
care
if
robert
was
at
agatha
when
she
got
there
she
would
let
him
see
that
her
hair
was
not
sunburned
and
ruined
to
match
the
hair
dressing
she
reached
back
in
her
closet
and
took
down
her
second
best
white
dress
she
was
hoping
that
agatha
would
be
well
enough
to
have
a
short
visit
kate
worked
so
steadily
that
she
seldom
saw
any
of
her
brothers
and
sisters
during
the
summer
in
winter
she
spent
a
day
with
each
of
them
if
she
could
possibly
manage
anyway
agatha
would
like
to
see
her
appearing
well
so
she
put
on
the
plain
snowy
linen
and
carefully
pinning
a
big
apron
over
it
she
went
to
the
kitchen
they
always
had
a
full
dinner
at
noon
and
worked
until
dusk
her
bath
had
made
her
later
than
she
intended
to
be
dusk
was
deepening
evening
chill
was
beginning
to
creep
into
the
air
she
closed
the
door
fed
little
poll
and
rolled
her
into
bed
set
the
potatoes
boiling
and
began
mixing
the
biscuit
she
had
them
just
ready
to
roll
when
steam
lifted
the
lid
of
the
potato
pot
with
the
soft
dough
in
her
hand
she
took
a
step
to
right
it
while
it
was
in
her
fingers
she
peered
into
the
pot
she
did
not
look
up
on
the
instant
the
door
opened
because
she
thought
it
would
be
adam
when
she
glanced
toward
the
door
she
saw
robert
standing
looking
at
her
he
had
stepped
inside
closed
the
door
and
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
was
waiting
for
her
to
see
him
oh
hello
said
kate
i
thought
it
was
adam
have
you
been
to
agatha
yet
yes
she
is
very
much
better
he
said
i
only
stopped
to
tell
you
that
her
mother
happened
to
come
out
for
the
night
and
they
not
need
you
i
surely
glad
she
is
better
said
kate
but
i
rather
disappointed
i
been
swimming
and
i
all
ready
to
go
she
set
the
pot
lid
in
place
accurately
and
gave
her
left
hand
a
deft
turn
to
save
the
dough
from
dripping
she
glanced
from
it
to
robert
expecting
to
see
him
open
the
door
and
disappear
instead
he
stood
looking
at
her
intently
suddenly
he
said
kate
will
you
marry
me
kate
mechanically
saved
the
dough
again
as
she
looked
at
the
pot
an
instant
then
she
said
casually
sure
it
would
be
splendid
to
have
a
doctor
right
in
the
house
when
little
poll
cuts
her
double
teeth
thank
you
said
robert
tersely
no
doubt
that
would
be
a
privilege
but
i
decline
to
marry
you
in
order
to
see
little
poll
safely
through
teething
he
stepped
outside
and
closed
the
door
very
completely
and
somewhat
pronouncedly
kate
stood
straight
an
instant
then
realized
biscuit
dough
was
slowly
creeping
down
her
wrist
with
a
quick
fling
she
shot
the
mass
into
the
scrap
bucket
and
sinking
on
the
chair
she
sat
on
to
peel
vegetables
she
lifted
her
apron
laid
her
head
on
her
knees
and
gave
a
big
gulping
sob
or
two
then
she
began
to
cry
silently
a
minute
later
the
door
opened
again
that
time
it
had
to
be
adam
but
kate
did
not
care
what
he
saw
or
what
he
thought
she
cried
on
in
perfect
abandon
then
steps
crossed
the
room
someone
knelt
beside
her
put
an
arm
around
her
and
said
kate
why
are
you
crying
kate
lifted
her
head
suddenly
and
applied
her
apron
skirt
none
of
your
business
she
said
to
robert
face
six
inches
from
hers
are
you
so
anxious
as
all
this
about
little
poll
teeth
he
asked
oh
drat
little
poll
teeth
cried
kate
the
tears
rolling
uninterruptedly
then
why
did
you
say
that
to
me
he
demanded
well
you
said
you
stopped
to
tell
me
that
i
need
go
to
agatha
she
explained
i
had
to
say
something
to
get
even
with
you
oh
said
robert
and
took
possession
kate
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
drew
his
head
against
hers
and
knew
a
minute
of
complete
joy
when
adam
entered
the
house
his
mother
was
very
busy
she
was
mixing
more
biscuit
dough
she
was
laughing
like
a
girl
of
sixteen
she
snatched
out
one
of
their
finest
tablecloths
and
put
on
many
extra
dishes
for
supper
while
uncle
robert
looking
like
a
different
man
was
helping
her
he
was
actually
stirring
the
gravy
and
getting
the
water
and
setting
up
chairs
and
he
was
under
high
tension
too
he
was
saying
things
of
no
moment
as
if
they
were
profound
wisdom
and
laughing
hilariously
at
things
that
were
scarcely
worth
a
smile
adam
looked
on
and
marvelled
and
all
the
while
his
irritation
grew
at
last
he
saw
a
glance
of
understanding
pass
between
them
he
could
endure
it
no
longer
oh
you
might
as
well
say
what
you
think
he
burst
forth
you
forgot
to
pull
down
the
blinds
both
the
brazen
creatures
laughed
as
if
that
were
a
fine
joke
they
immediately
threw
off
all
reserve
by
the
time
the
meal
was
finished
adam
was
struggling
to
keep
from
saying
the
meanest
things
he
could
think
of
also
he
had
to
go
to
milly
with
nothing
very
definite
to
tell
but
when
he
came
back
his
mother
was
waiting
for
him
she
said
at
once
adam
i
very
sorry
the
blind
was
up
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
and
tell
you
myself
that
the
first
real
love
for
a
man
that
i
have
ever
known
is
in
my
heart
why
mother
said
adam
it
true
said
kate
quietly
you
see
adam
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
robert
gray
i
knew
and
he
knew
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
engaging
himself
to
nancy
ellen
but
the
thing
was
done
she
was
happy
we
simply
realized
that
we
would
have
done
better
together
and
let
it
go
at
that
but
all
these
years
i
have
known
that
i
could
have
made
him
a
wife
who
would
have
come
closer
to
his
ideals
than
my
sister
and
she
should
have
had
the
man
who
wanted
to
marry
me
they
would
have
had
a
wonderful
time
together
and
where
did
my
father
come
in
asked
adam
quietly
he
took
advantage
of
my
blackest
hour
said
kate
i
married
him
when
i
positively
did
care
what
happened
to
me
the
man
i
could
have
loved
was
married
to
my
sister
the
man
i
could
have
married
and
lived
with
in
comfort
to
both
of
us
was
out
of
the
question
it
was
in
the
bates
blood
to
marry
about
the
time
i
did
i
had
seen
only
the
very
best
of
your
father
and
he
was
an
attractive
lover
not
bad
looking
not
embarrassed
with
one
single
scruple
it
the
way
of
the
world
i
took
it
i
paid
for
it
only
god
knows
how
dearly
i
paid
but
adam
if
you
love
me
stand
by
me
now
let
me
have
this
eleventh
hour
happiness
with
no
alloy
anything
i
feel
for
your
uncle
robert
has
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
my
being
your
mother
with
you
being
my
son
kiss
me
and
tell
me
you
glad
adam
adam
rose
up
and
put
his
arms
around
his
mother
all
his
resentment
was
gone
he
was
happy
as
he
could
be
for
his
mother
and
happier
than
he
ever
before
had
been
for
himself
the
following
afternoon
kate
took
the
car
and
went
to
see
agatha
instead
of
husking
corn
she
dressed
with
care
and
arrived
about
three
leading
poll
in
whitest
white
with
cheeks
still
rosy
from
her
afternoon
nap
agatha
was
sitting
up
and
delighted
to
see
them
she
said
they
were
the
first
of
the
family
who
had
come
to
visit
her
and
she
thought
they
had
come
because
she
was
thinking
of
them
then
she
told
kate
about
her
illness
she
said
it
dated
from
father
bates
stroke
and
the
dreadful
days
immediately
following
when
adam
had
completely
lost
and
she
had
not
been
able
to
influence
him
i
think
it
broke
my
heart
she
said
simply
then
they
talked
the
family
over
and
at
last
agatha
said
kate
what
is
this
i
hear
about
robert
have
you
been
informed
that
southey
is
back
in
hartley
and
that
she
is
working
every
possible
chance
and
using
multifarious
blandishments
on
him
kate
laughed
heartily
and
suddenly
she
never
had
heard
blandishments
used
in
common
conversation
as
she
struggled
to
regain
agatha
spoke
again
it
no
laughing
matter
she
said
the
report
has
every
of
verisimilitude
the
bates
family
has
a
way
of
feeling
deeply
we
all
loved
nancy
ellen
we
all
suffered
severely
and
lost
something
that
never
could
be
replaced
when
she
went
of
course
all
of
us
realized
that
robert
would
enter
the
bonds
of
matrimony
again
none
of
us
would
have
objected
even
if
he
remarried
soon
but
all
of
us
do
object
to
his
marrying
a
woman
who
would
have
broken
nancy
ellen
heart
if
she
could
and
yesterday
i
took
advantage
of
my
illness
and
told
him
so
then
i
asked
him
why
a
man
of
his
standing
and
ability
in
this
community
did
frustrate
that
unprincipled
creature
vermiculations
toward
him
by
marrying
you
at
once
slowly
kate
sank
down
in
her
chair
her
face
whitened
and
then
grew
greenish
she
breathed
with
difficulty
oh
agatha
was
all
she
could
say
i
do
not
regret
it
said
agatha
if
he
is
going
to
ruin
himself
he
is
not
going
to
do
it
without
knowing
that
the
bates
family
highly
disapprove
of
his
course
but
why
drag
me
in
said
kate
almost
too
shocked
to
speak
at
all
maybe
he
loves
southey
she
has
let
him
see
how
she
feels
about
him
possibly
he
feels
the
same
about
her
he
does
if
he
weds
her
said
agatha
conclusively
anything
any
one
could
say
or
do
would
have
no
effect
if
he
had
centred
his
affections
upon
her
of
that
you
may
be
very
sure
may
i
asked
kate
dully
indeed
you
may
said
agatha
the
male
of
the
species
when
he
is
a
man
of
robert
attainments
and
calibre
can
be
swerved
from
pursuit
of
the
female
he
covets
by
nothing
save
extinction
you
mean
said
kate
with
an
effort
that
if
robert
asked
a
woman
to
marry
him
it
would
mean
that
he
loved
her
indubitably
cried
agatha
kate
laughed
until
she
felt
a
little
better
but
she
went
home
in
a
mood
far
different
from
that
in
which
she
started
then
she
had
been
very
happy
and
she
had
intended
to
tell
agatha
about
her
happiness
the
very
first
of
all
now
she
was
far
from
happy
possibly
a
thousand
things
the
most
possible
that
robert
had
responded
to
agatha
suggestion
and
stopped
and
asked
her
that
abrupt
question
from
an
impulse
as
sudden
and
inexplicable
as
had
possessed
her
when
she
married
george
holt
kate
fervently
wished
she
had
gone
to
the
cornfield
as
usual
that
afternoon
that
the
way
it
goes
she
said
angrily
as
she
threw
off
her
better
dress
and
put
on
her
gingham
to
prepare
supper
that
the
way
it
goes
stay
in
your
element
and
go
on
with
your
work
and
you
all
right
leave
your
job
and
go
trapesing
over
the
country
wasting
your
time
and
you
get
a
heartache
to
pay
you
i
might
as
well
give
up
the
idea
that
i
ever
to
be
happy
like
anybody
else
every
time
i
think
happiness
is
coming
my
way
along
comes
something
that
knocks
it
higher
than
gilderoy
kite
hang
the
luck
she
saw
robert
pass
while
she
was
washing
the
dishes
and
knew
he
was
going
to
agatha
and
would
stop
when
he
came
back
she
finished
her
work
put
little
poll
to
bed
and
made
herself
as
attractive
as
she
knew
how
in
her
prettiest
blue
dress
all
the
time
she
debated
whether
she
would
say
anything
to
him
about
what
agatha
had
said
or
not
she
decided
she
would
wait
awhile
and
watch
how
he
acted
she
thought
she
could
soon
tell
so
when
robert
came
she
was
as
nearly
herself
as
possible
but
when
he
began
to
talk
about
being
married
soon
the
most
she
would
say
was
that
she
would
begin
to
think
about
it
at
christmas
and
tell
him
by
spring
robert
was
bitterly
disappointed
he
was
very
lonely
he
needed
better
housekeeping
than
his
aged
mother
was
capable
of
to
keep
him
up
to
a
high
mark
in
his
work
neither
of
them
was
young
any
longer
he
could
see
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
married
at
once
of
the
reason
in
kate
mind
he
had
not
a
glimmering
but
kate
had
her
way
she
would
not
even
talk
of
a
time
or
express
an
opinion
as
to
whether
she
would
remain
on
the
farm
or
live
in
nancy
ellen
house
or
sell
it
and
build
whatever
she
wanted
for
herself
robert
went
away
baffled
and
disappointed
over
some
intangible
thing
he
could
not
understand
for
six
weeks
kate
tortured
herself
and
kept
robert
from
being
happy
then
one
morning
agatha
stopped
to
visit
with
her
while
adam
drove
on
to
town
after
they
had
exhausted
farming
little
poll
charms
and
the
neighbours
agatha
looked
at
kate
and
said
katherine
what
is
this
i
hear
about
robert
coming
here
every
day
now
it
appeals
to
me
that
he
must
have
followed
my
advice
of
course
he
never
would
have
thought
of
coming
if
you
had
told
him
so
said
kate
dryly
now
there
you
are
in
error
said
the
literal
agatha
as
she
smoothed
down
little
poll
skirts
and
twisted
her
ringlets
into
formal
corkscrews
right
there
you
are
in
error
my
dear
the
reason
i
told
robert
to
marry
you
was
because
he
said
to
me
when
he
suggested
going
after
you
to
stay
the
night
with
me
that
he
had
seen
you
in
the
field
when
he
passed
and
that
you
were
the
most
glorious
specimen
of
womanhood
that
he
ever
had
seen
he
said
you
were
the
one
to
stay
with
me
in
case
there
should
be
any
trouble
because
your
head
was
always
level
and
your
heart
was
big
as
a
barrel
yes
that
the
reason
i
ca
always
have
it
with
me
said
kate
looking
glorified
instead
of
glorious
agatha
it
just
happens
to
mean
very
much
to
me
will
you
just
kindly
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
me
every
single
word
robert
said
to
you
and
you
said
to
him
that
day
why
i
have
informed
you
explicitly
said
agatha
using
her
handkerchief
on
the
toe
of
poll
blue
shoe
he
mentioned
going
after
you
and
said
what
i
told
you
and
i
told
him
to
go
he
praised
you
so
highly
that
when
i
spoke
to
him
about
the
southey
woman
i
remembered
it
so
i
suggested
to
him
as
he
seemed
to
think
so
well
of
you
it
just
that
minute
flashed
into
my
mind
but
he
made
me
think
of
it
calling
you
and
headed
and
hearted
heavens
katherine
eleanor
what
more
could
you
ask
i
guess
that
should
be
enough
said
kate
one
certainly
would
presume
so
said
agatha
then
adam
came
and
handed
kate
her
mail
as
she
stood
beside
his
car
talking
to
him
a
minute
while
agatha
settled
herself
as
kate
closed
the
gate
behind
her
she
saw
a
big
square
white
envelope
among
the
newspapers
advertisements
and
letters
she
slipped
it
out
and
looked
at
it
intently
then
she
ran
her
finger
under
the
flap
and
read
the
contents
she
stood
studying
the
few
lines
it
contained
frowning
deeply
does
it
beat
the
band
she
asked
of
the
surrounding
atmosphere
she
went
up
the
walk
entered
the
living
room
slipped
the
letter
under
the
lid
of
the
big
family
bible
and
walking
to
the
telephone
she
called
gray
office
he
answered
the
call
in
person
robert
this
is
kate
she
said
would
you
have
any
deeply
rooted
objections
to
marrying
me
at
six
this
evening
well
i
should
say
not
boomed
robert
voice
the
not
coming
so
forcibly
kate
dodged
have
you
got
the
information
necessary
for
a
license
she
asked
yes
he
answered
then
bring
one
and
your
minister
and
come
at
six
she
said
and
oh
yes
robert
will
it
be
all
right
with
you
if
i
stay
here
and
keep
house
for
adam
until
he
and
milly
can
be
married
and
move
in
then
i
come
to
your
house
just
as
it
is
i
do
mind
coming
to
nancy
ellen
home
as
i
would
another
woman
surely
he
cried
any
arrangement
you
make
will
satisfy
me
all
right
i
expect
you
with
the
document
and
the
minister
at
six
then
said
kate
and
hung
up
the
receiver
then
she
took
it
down
again
and
calling
milly
asked
her
to
bring
her
best
white
dress
and
come
up
right
away
and
help
her
get
ready
to
entertain
a
few
people
that
evening
then
she
called
her
sister
hannah
and
asked
her
if
she
thought
that
in
the
event
she
kate
wished
that
evening
at
six
to
marry
a
very
fine
man
and
had
no
preparations
whatever
made
her
family
would
help
her
out
to
the
extent
of
providing
the
supper
she
wanted
all
of
them
and
all
the
children
but
the
arrangement
had
come
up
suddenly
and
she
could
not
possibly
prepare
a
supper
herself
for
such
a
big
family
in
the
length
of
time
she
had
hannah
said
she
was
perfectly
sure
everyone
of
them
would
drop
everything
and
be
tickled
to
pieces
to
bring
the
supper
and
to
come
and
they
would
have
a
grand
time
what
did
kate
want
oh
she
wanted
bread
and
chicken
for
meat
maybe
some
potato
chips
and
angel
food
cake
and
a
big
freezer
or
two
of
agatha
best
ice
cream
and
she
thought
possibly
more
butter
and
coffee
than
she
had
on
hand
she
had
plenty
of
sugar
and
cream
and
pickles
and
jelly
she
would
have
the
tables
all
set
as
she
did
for
christmas
then
kate
rang
for
adam
and
put
a
broom
in
his
hand
as
he
entered
the
back
door
she
met
milly
with
a
pail
of
hot
water
and
cloths
to
wash
the
glass
she
went
to
her
room
and
got
out
her
best
afternoon
dress
of
dull
blue
with
gold
lace
and
a
pink
velvet
rose
she
shook
it
out
and
studied
it
she
had
worn
it
twice
on
the
trip
north
none
of
them
save
adam
ever
had
seen
it
she
put
it
on
and
looked
at
it
critically
then
she
called
milly
and
they
changed
the
neck
and
sleeves
a
little
took
a
yard
of
width
from
the
skirt
and
behold
it
became
a
creation
in
the
very
height
of
style
then
kate
opened
her
trunk
and
got
out
the
petticoat
hose
and
low
shoes
to
match
it
and
laid
them
on
her
bed
then
they
set
the
table
laid
a
fire
ready
to
strike
in
the
cook
stove
saw
that
the
gas
was
all
right
set
out
the
big
coffee
boiler
and
skimmed
a
crock
full
of
cream
by
four
they
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
do
then
kate
bathed
and
went
to
her
room
to
dress
adam
and
milly
were
busy
making
themselves
fine
little
poll
sat
in
her
prettiest
dress
watching
her
beloved
tate
until
adam
came
and
took
her
he
had
been
instructed
to
send
robert
and
the
minister
to
his
mother
room
as
soon
as
they
came
kate
was
trying
to
look
her
best
yet
making
haste
so
that
she
would
be
ready
on
time
she
had
made
no
arrangements
except
to
spread
a
white
goatskin
where
she
and
robert
would
stand
at
the
end
of
the
big
living
room
near
her
door
before
she
was
fully
dressed
she
began
to
hear
young
voices
and
knew
that
her
people
were
coming
when
she
was
ready
kate
looked
at
herself
and
muttered
i
give
robert
and
all
of
them
a
good
surprise
this
is
a
real
dress
thanks
to
nancy
ellen
the
poor
girl
it
scarcely
fair
to
her
to
marry
her
man
in
a
dress
she
gave
me
but
i
stake
my
life
she
rather
i
have
him
than
any
other
woman
it
was
an
evening
of
surprises
at
six
adam
lighted
a
big
log
festooned
with
leaves
and
berries
so
that
the
flames
roared
and
crackled
up
the
chimney
the
early
arrivals
were
the
young
people
who
had
hung
the
mantel
gas
fixtures
curtain
poles
and
draped
the
doors
with
long
sprays
of
bittersweet
northern
holly
and
great
branches
of
red
spice
berries
dogwood
with
its
red
leaves
and
berries
and
scarlet
and
yellow
oak
leaves
the
elders
followed
and
piled
the
table
with
heaps
of
food
then
trailed
red
vines
between
dishes
in
a
quandary
as
to
what
to
wear
without
knowing
what
was
expected
of
him
further
than
saying
i
will
at
the
proper
moment
robert
ended
by
slipping
into
kate
room
dressed
in
white
flannel
the
ceremony
was
over
at
ten
minutes
after
six
kate
was
lovely
robert
was
handsome
everyone
was
happy
the
supper
was
a
banquet
the
bates
family
went
home
adam
disappeared
with
milly
while
little
poll
went
to
sleep
left
to
themselves
robert
took
kate
in
his
arms
and
tried
to
tell
her
how
much
he
loved
her
but
felt
he
expressed
himself
poorly
as
she
stood
before
him
he
said
and
now
dear
tell
me
what
changed
you
and
why
we
are
married
instead
of
at
christmas
or
in
the
spring
oh
yes
said
kate
i
almost
forgot
why
i
wanted
you
to
answer
a
letter
for
me
lucid
said
robert
he
seated
himself
beside
the
table
bring
on
the
ink
and
stationary
and
let
me
get
it
over
kate
obeyed
and
with
the
writing
material
laid
down
the
letter
she
had
that
morning
received
from
john
jardine
telling
her
that
his
wife
had
died
suddenly
and
that
as
soon
as
he
had
laid
her
away
he
was
coming
to
exact
a
definite
promise
from
her
as
to
the
future
and
that
he
would
move
heaven
and
earth
before
he
would
again
be
disappointed
robert
read
the
letter
and
laid
it
down
his
face
slowing
flushing
scarlet
you
called
me
out
here
and
married
me
expressly
to
answer
this
he
demanded
of
course
said
kate
i
thought
if
you
could
tell
him
that
his
letter
came
the
day
i
married
you
it
would
stop
his
coming
and
not
be
such
a
disappointment
to
him
robert
pushed
the
letter
from
him
violently
and
arose
by
he
checked
himself
and
stared
at
her
kate
you
do
mean
that
he
cried
tell
me
you
do
mean
that
why
sure
i
do
said
kate
it
gave
me
a
fine
excuse
i
was
so
homesick
for
you
and
tired
waiting
to
begin
life
with
you
agatha
told
me
about
her
telling
you
the
day
she
was
ill
to
marry
me
and
the
reason
i
would
was
because
i
thought
maybe
you
asked
me
so
offhandlike
because
she
told
you
to
and
you
did
really
love
me
then
this
morning
she
was
here
and
we
were
talking
and
she
got
round
it
again
and
then
she
told
me
all
you
said
and
i
saw
you
did
love
me
and
that
you
would
have
asked
me
if
she
had
said
anything
and
i
wanted
you
so
badly
robert
ever
since
that
day
we
met
on
the
footlog
i
know
that
you
were
the
only
man
i
every
really
want
to
marry
robert
i
never
come
anywhere
near
loving
anybody
else
the
minute
agatha
told
me
this
morning
i
began
to
think
how
i
could
take
back
what
i
been
saying
how
i
could
change
and
right
then
adam
handed
me
that
letter
and
it
gave
me
a
fine
way
out
and
so
i
called
you
sure
i
married
you
to
answer
that
robert
now
go
and
do
it
all
right
he
said
in
a
minute
then
he
walked
to
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
again
but
kate
could
not
understand
why
he
was
laughing
until
he
shook
when
he
kissed
her
